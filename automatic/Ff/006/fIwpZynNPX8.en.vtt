is Brian today we're going to be talking
about<00:00:11.400> strumming<00:00:12.360> something<00:00:13.230> very<00:00:13.500> important

00:00:14.110 --> 00:00:14.120 
about strumming something very important

00:00:14.120 --> 00:00:16.550 
about strumming something very important
something<00:00:15.120> that's<00:00:15.269> very<00:00:15.330> simple<00:00:16.199> but<00:00:16.320> a<00:00:16.379> lot

00:00:16.550 --> 00:00:16.560 
something that's very simple but a lot

00:00:16.560 --> 00:00:18.019 
something that's very simple but a lot
of<00:00:16.590> people<00:00:16.800> make<00:00:17.100> a<00:00:17.130> lot<00:00:17.369> more<00:00:17.430> complicated

00:00:18.019 --> 00:00:18.029 
of people make a lot more complicated

00:00:18.029 --> 00:00:21.400 
of people make a lot more complicated
than<00:00:18.449> it<00:00:18.510> needs<00:00:18.600> to<00:00:18.869> be<00:00:19.400> okay<00:00:20.400> strumming

00:00:21.400 --> 00:00:21.410 
than it needs to be okay strumming

00:00:21.410 --> 00:00:24.259 
than it needs to be okay strumming
basically<00:00:22.410> is<00:00:22.529> math<00:00:22.800> and<00:00:22.830> its<00:00:23.640> really<00:00:23.880> simple

00:00:24.259 --> 00:00:24.269 
basically is math and its really simple

00:00:24.269 --> 00:00:26.179 
basically is math and its really simple
math<00:00:24.660> I<00:00:24.900> was<00:00:25.050> never<00:00:25.230> good<00:00:25.470> at<00:00:25.500> math<00:00:25.769> but<00:00:26.039> this

00:00:26.179 --> 00:00:26.189 
math I was never good at math but this

00:00:26.189 --> 00:00:27.710 
math I was never good at math but this
is<00:00:26.310> very<00:00:26.550> simple<00:00:26.849> math<00:00:27.119> so<00:00:27.330> everyone<00:00:27.689> should

00:00:27.710 --> 00:00:27.720 
is very simple math so everyone should

00:00:27.720 --> 00:00:30.259 
is very simple math so everyone should
be<00:00:27.869> able<00:00:27.930> to<00:00:28.140> understand<00:00:28.560> this<00:00:29.269> it's

00:00:30.259 --> 00:00:30.269 
be able to understand this it's

00:00:30.269 --> 00:00:34.280 
be able to understand this it's
basically<00:00:31.640> everything<00:00:32.640> is<00:00:33.290> multiplications

00:00:34.280 --> 00:00:34.290 
basically everything is multiplications

00:00:34.290 --> 00:00:37.280 
basically everything is multiplications
or<00:00:34.559> divisions<00:00:34.790> of<00:00:35.790> two<00:00:36.270> okay<00:00:36.989> everything

00:00:37.280 --> 00:00:37.290 
or divisions of two okay everything

00:00:37.290 --> 00:00:38.420 
or divisions of two okay everything
doubles<00:00:37.739> when<00:00:37.980> we're<00:00:38.100> talking<00:00:38.219> about

00:00:38.420 --> 00:00:38.430 
doubles when we're talking about

00:00:38.430 --> 00:00:40.250 
doubles when we're talking about
strumming<00:00:38.850> okay<00:00:39.780> so<00:00:39.840> we're<00:00:40.050> going<00:00:40.140> to<00:00:40.230> start

00:00:40.250 --> 00:00:40.260 
strumming okay so we're going to start

00:00:40.260 --> 00:00:41.990 
strumming okay so we're going to start
with<00:00:40.559> some<00:00:40.710> very<00:00:40.950> simple<00:00:41.219> stuff<00:00:41.520> say<00:00:41.700> I'm<00:00:41.790> just

00:00:41.990 --> 00:00:42.000 
with some very simple stuff say I'm just

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:44.580 
with some very simple stuff say I'm just
holding<00:00:42.149> a<00:00:42.360> C<00:00:42.540> chord<00:00:42.780> down<00:00:43.079> here

00:00:44.580 --> 00:00:44.590 
holding a C chord down here

00:00:44.590 --> 00:00:46.830 
holding a C chord down here
and<00:00:44.710> I<00:00:45.190> want<00:00:45.370> to<00:00:45.460> strum<00:00:45.820> we're<00:00:46.420> going<00:00:46.510> to<00:00:46.600> start

00:00:46.830 --> 00:00:46.840 
and I want to strum we're going to start

00:00:46.840 --> 00:00:49.140 
and I want to strum we're going to start
by<00:00:46.930> talking<00:00:47.110> about<00:00:47.410> quarter<00:00:47.950> notes<00:00:48.160> okay<00:00:49.120> a

00:00:49.140 --> 00:00:49.150 
by talking about quarter notes okay a

00:00:49.150 --> 00:00:52.140 
by talking about quarter notes okay a
quarter<00:00:49.570> note<00:00:49.600> is<00:00:50.320> basically<00:00:50.980> when<00:00:51.760> you<00:00:51.790> hear

00:00:52.140 --> 00:00:52.150 
quarter note is basically when you hear

00:00:52.150 --> 00:00:55.170 
quarter note is basically when you hear
the<00:00:52.270> beep<00:00:52.710> you're<00:00:53.710> strumming<00:00:54.010> on<00:00:54.250> the<00:00:54.309> beat<00:00:54.610> so

00:00:55.170 --> 00:00:55.180 
the beep you're strumming on the beat so

00:00:55.180 --> 00:00:57.780 
the beep you're strumming on the beat so
say<00:00:55.390> we<00:00:55.570> set<00:00:55.750> our<00:00:55.870> metronome<00:00:56.200> to<00:00:56.380> ad<00:00:56.559> I<00:00:56.920> got<00:00:57.670> my

00:00:57.780 --> 00:00:57.790 
say we set our metronome to ad I got my

00:00:57.790 --> 00:01:00.210 
say we set our metronome to ad I got my
metronome<00:00:58.090> an<00:00:58.239> 80<00:00:58.420> here<00:00:58.720> each<00:00:59.500> time<00:00:59.770> you<00:00:59.950> hear

00:01:00.210 --> 00:01:00.220 
metronome an 80 here each time you hear

00:01:00.220 --> 00:01:02.520 
metronome an 80 here each time you hear
that<00:01:00.340> beat<00:01:00.610> that's<00:01:01.090> your<00:01:01.330> quarter<00:01:01.660> note<00:01:01.840> so<00:01:02.470> if

00:01:02.520 --> 00:01:02.530 
that beat that's your quarter note so if

00:01:02.530 --> 00:01:09.290 
that beat that's your quarter note so if
we're<00:01:02.650> counting<00:01:03.239> one<00:01:04.239> two<00:01:04.800> three<00:01:05.800> four<00:01:06.510> 1234

we're counting one two three four 1234

00:01:09.300 --> 00:01:11.310 
we're counting one two three four 1234
that's<00:01:10.300> how<00:01:10.420> we're<00:01:10.570> going<00:01:10.690> to<00:01:10.750> strum<00:01:11.080> on

00:01:11.310 --> 00:01:11.320 
that's how we're going to strum on

00:01:11.320 --> 00:01:13.560 
that's how we're going to strum on
quarter<00:01:11.920> notes<00:01:12.130> okay<00:01:12.970> so<00:01:13.090> if<00:01:13.150> I'm<00:01:13.240> holding<00:01:13.390> a

00:01:36.090 --> 00:01:36.100 
beat all down strums okay now we're

00:01:36.100 --> 00:01:38.819 
beat all down strums okay now we're
going<00:01:36.189> to<00:01:36.369> multiply<00:01:36.729> by<00:01:37.299> two<00:01:37.710> okay<00:01:38.710> we're

00:01:38.819 --> 00:01:38.829 
going to multiply by two okay we're

00:01:38.829 --> 00:01:40.260 
going to multiply by two okay we're
going<00:01:38.920> to<00:01:39.009> keep<00:01:39.159> our<00:01:39.340> metronome<00:01:39.729> speed<00:01:40.090> the

00:01:40.260 --> 00:01:40.270 
going to keep our metronome speed the

00:01:40.270 --> 00:01:42.319 
going to keep our metronome speed the
same<00:01:40.479> but<00:01:40.689> we're<00:01:40.780> going<00:01:40.869> to<00:01:40.929> add<00:01:41.170> an<00:01:41.470> up<00:01:41.890> strong

00:01:42.319 --> 00:01:42.329 
same but we're going to add an up strong

00:01:42.329 --> 00:01:44.130 
same but we're going to add an up strong
okay<00:01:43.329> and<00:01:43.539> we're<00:01:43.659> going<00:01:43.780> to<00:01:43.840> take<00:01:43.960> those

00:01:44.130 --> 00:01:44.140 
okay and we're going to take those

00:01:44.140 --> 00:01:45.300 
okay and we're going to take those
quarter<00:01:44.560> notes<00:01:44.590> and<00:01:44.920> we're<00:01:45.009> going<00:01:45.130> to<00:01:45.159> turn

00:01:45.300 --> 00:01:45.310 
quarter notes and we're going to turn

00:01:45.310 --> 00:01:46.770 
quarter notes and we're going to turn
them<00:01:45.460> into<00:01:45.549> what's<00:01:45.759> called<00:01:45.850> eighth<00:01:46.179> notes<00:01:46.479> now

00:01:46.770 --> 00:01:46.780 
them into what's called eighth notes now

00:01:46.780 --> 00:01:49.830 
them into what's called eighth notes now
okay<00:01:47.770> so<00:01:47.829> basically<00:01:48.189> you're<00:01:48.670> hearing<00:01:49.030> to

00:01:49.830 --> 00:01:49.840 
okay so basically you're hearing to

00:01:49.840 --> 00:01:54.510 
okay so basically you're hearing to
strums<00:01:50.319> now<00:01:50.649> /<00:01:51.579> be<00:01:51.929> okay<00:01:52.929> as<00:01:53.250> before<00:01:54.250> with

00:01:54.510 --> 00:01:54.520 
strums now / be okay as before with

00:01:54.520 --> 00:01:56.130 
strums now / be okay as before with
quarter<00:01:55.149> notes<00:01:55.179> you're<00:01:55.539> just<00:01:55.750> hearing<00:01:55.899> one

00:01:56.130 --> 00:01:56.140 
quarter notes you're just hearing one

00:01:56.140 --> 00:01:59.399 
quarter notes you're just hearing one
strum<00:01:56.560> per<00:01:57.369> beat<00:01:57.610> we're<00:01:58.299> now<00:01:58.450> multiplying<00:01:58.869> by

00:01:59.399 --> 00:01:59.409 
strum per beat we're now multiplying by

00:01:59.409 --> 00:02:00.929 
strum per beat we're now multiplying by
2<00:01:59.470> and<00:01:59.740> you're<00:01:59.860> going<00:01:59.979> to<00:02:00.039> hear<00:02:00.130> two<00:02:00.340> strums<00:02:00.700> /

00:02:00.929 --> 00:02:00.939 
2 and you're going to hear two strums /

00:02:00.939 --> 00:02:04.399 
2 and you're going to hear two strums /
be<00:02:01.200> so<00:02:02.200> I<00:02:02.229> set<00:02:02.470> my<00:02:02.590> metronome<00:02:02.920> 280<00:02:03.280> again<00:02:03.640> and

00:02:04.399 --> 00:02:04.409 
be so I set my metronome 280 again and

00:04:33.010 --> 00:04:33.020 
slow that down a little and I'm going to

00:04:33.020 --> 00:04:35.590 
slow that down a little and I'm going to
strum<00:04:33.590> the<00:04:34.550> whole<00:04:34.760> time<00:04:34.970> with<00:04:35.150> my<00:04:35.270> hand<00:04:35.450> even

though<00:04:35.780> I'm<00:04:35.870> not<00:04:35.900> hitting<00:04:36.200> the<00:04:36.290> strings<00:04:36.620> on

00:04:36.820 --> 00:04:36.830 
though I'm not hitting the strings on

00:04:36.830 --> 00:04:53.809 
though I'm not hitting the strings on
someone<00:04:37.190> so<00:04:37.490> check<00:04:37.730> it<00:04:37.760> out

00:04:53.809 --> 00:04:53.819 

00:04:53.819 --> 00:04:57.300 

okay<00:04:54.819> the<00:04:55.120> whole<00:04:55.330> time<00:04:55.569> I'm<00:04:55.900> thinking<00:04:56.099> one<00:04:57.099> E

00:04:57.300 --> 00:04:57.310 
okay the whole time I'm thinking one E

00:04:57.310 --> 00:05:00.659 
okay the whole time I'm thinking one E
and<00:04:57.370> a<00:04:57.879> two<00:04:57.909> E<00:04:58.479> and<00:04:58.509> A<00:04:58.990> three<00:04:59.020> E<00:04:59.379> and<00:04:59.560> a<00:04:59.830> four<00:05:00.220> E

00:05:00.659 --> 00:05:00.669 
and a two E and A three E and a four E

00:05:00.669 --> 00:05:03.469 
and a two E and A three E and a four E
and<00:05:00.840> so<00:05:01.840> when<00:05:01.990> I<00:05:02.050> decide<00:05:02.349> to<00:05:02.379> hit<00:05:02.560> that<00:05:02.740> guitar

00:05:03.469 --> 00:05:03.479 
and so when I decide to hit that guitar

00:05:03.479 --> 00:05:05.399 
and so when I decide to hit that guitar
