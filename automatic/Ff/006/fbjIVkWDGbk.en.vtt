00:02:40.930 --> 00:02:40.940 
as a diver but more importantly as a

00:02:40.940 --> 00:02:45.610 
as a diver but more importantly as a
person<00:02:41.450> I<00:02:42.130> think<00:02:43.130> going<00:02:43.880> into<00:02:44.090> school<00:02:45.019> my<00:02:45.410> mind

00:02:45.610 --> 00:02:45.620 
person I think going into school my mind

00:02:45.620 --> 00:02:47.320 
person I think going into school my mind
was<00:02:45.800> all<00:02:45.950> about<00:02:46.100> diving<00:02:46.430> and<00:02:46.760> I<00:02:46.850> wasn't<00:02:47.030> really

00:02:47.320 --> 00:02:47.330 
was all about diving and I wasn't really

00:02:47.330 --> 00:02:49.449 
was all about diving and I wasn't really
focused<00:02:47.480> on<00:02:47.810> what<00:02:48.050> was<00:02:48.200> beyond<00:02:48.650> diving<00:02:49.130> and<00:02:49.280> I

00:02:49.449 --> 00:02:49.459 
focused on what was beyond diving and I

00:02:49.459 --> 00:02:51.160 
focused on what was beyond diving and I
think<00:02:50.090> that's<00:02:50.239> where<00:02:50.420> Adam<00:02:50.690> came<00:02:50.900> in<00:02:51.019> and<00:02:51.110> he

00:02:51.160 --> 00:02:51.170 
think that's where Adam came in and he

00:02:51.170 --> 00:02:52.449 
think that's where Adam came in and he
gave<00:02:51.320> me<00:02:51.350> a<00:02:51.470> perspective<00:02:51.739> that<00:02:52.160> you<00:02:52.340> know

00:02:52.449 --> 00:02:52.459 
gave me a perspective that you know

00:02:52.459 --> 00:02:54.100 
gave me a perspective that you know
diving<00:02:52.880> is<00:02:52.970> not<00:02:53.090> everything<00:02:53.390> and<00:02:53.690> I<00:02:53.750> know<00:02:53.810> that

00:02:54.100 --> 00:02:54.110 
diving is not everything and I know that

00:02:54.110 --> 00:02:57.040 
diving is not everything and I know that
diving<00:02:54.380> isn't<00:02:54.830> everything<00:02:55.040> so<00:02:55.840> he<00:02:56.840> definitely

00:02:57.040 --> 00:02:57.050 
diving isn't everything so he definitely

00:02:57.050 --> 00:02:59.680 
diving isn't everything so he definitely
takes<00:02:58.040> me<00:02:58.220> outside<00:02:58.580> of<00:02:58.610> this<00:02:58.910> and<00:02:59.150> lets<00:02:59.330> me<00:02:59.390> see

00:02:59.680 --> 00:02:59.690 
takes me outside of this and lets me see

00:02:59.690 --> 00:03:02.280 
takes me outside of this and lets me see
what<00:03:00.260> my<00:03:00.290> future<00:03:00.769> is<00:03:00.800> going<00:03:01.010> to<00:03:01.069> look<00:03:01.130> like<00:03:01.220> and
