00:00:19.359 --> 00:00:19.369 
part of my car and pulled up on the door

00:00:19.369 --> 00:00:22.580 
part of my car and pulled up on the door
like<00:00:20.369> so<00:00:20.699> like<00:00:21.270> you'd<00:00:21.390> normally<00:00:21.510> would<00:00:21.900> and

00:00:22.580 --> 00:00:22.590 
like so like you'd normally would and

00:00:22.590 --> 00:00:24.230 
like so like you'd normally would and
the<00:00:22.769> door<00:00:22.949> came<00:00:23.160> out<00:00:23.310> the<00:00:23.490> whole<00:00:23.670> door<00:00:23.880> handle

00:00:24.230 --> 00:00:24.240 
the door came out the whole door handle

00:00:24.240 --> 00:00:26.750 
the door came out the whole door handle
and<00:00:24.390> everything<00:00:25.230> basically<00:00:25.470> came<00:00:25.920> out<00:00:25.949> almost

00:00:26.750 --> 00:00:26.760 
and everything basically came out almost

00:00:26.760 --> 00:00:29.179 
and everything basically came out almost
like<00:00:26.880> you<00:00:27.000> see<00:00:27.029> it<00:00:27.240> here<00:00:27.630> I've<00:00:28.560> got<00:00:28.769> it<00:00:28.800> resting

00:00:29.179 --> 00:00:29.189 
like you see it here I've got it resting

00:00:29.189 --> 00:00:31.359 
like you see it here I've got it resting
there<00:00:29.340> so<00:00:29.490> I<00:00:29.519> don't<00:00:29.580> scratch<00:00:29.849> my<00:00:30.000> paint<00:00:30.029> but

00:00:31.359 --> 00:00:31.369 
there so I don't scratch my paint but

00:00:31.369 --> 00:00:35.060 
there so I don't scratch my paint but
basically<00:00:32.369> all<00:00:32.579> came<00:00:32.820> out<00:00:33.000> and<00:00:33.239> I<00:00:34.230> believe<00:00:34.980> I

00:00:35.060 --> 00:00:35.070 
basically all came out and I believe I

00:00:35.070 --> 00:00:37.700 
basically all came out and I believe I
traced<00:00:35.399> the<00:00:35.640> problem<00:00:36.210> to<00:00:36.690> not<00:00:37.290> sure<00:00:37.440> how<00:00:37.559> it

00:00:37.700 --> 00:00:37.710 
traced the problem to not sure how it

00:00:37.710 --> 00:00:39.860 
traced the problem to not sure how it
happened<00:00:38.010> but<00:00:38.160> these<00:00:38.700> two<00:00:38.910> slider<00:00:39.239> brackets

00:00:39.860 --> 00:00:39.870 
happened but these two slider brackets

00:00:39.870 --> 00:00:44.510 
happened but these two slider brackets
here<00:00:40.230> are<00:00:40.800> basically<00:00:41.160> two<00:00:41.610> little<00:00:43.100> ones<00:00:44.100> one

00:00:44.510 --> 00:00:44.520 
here are basically two little ones one

00:00:44.520 --> 00:00:46.660 
here are basically two little ones one
slider<00:00:44.850> piece<00:00:45.120> actually<00:00:45.570> the<00:00:46.020> two<00:00:46.170> little

00:00:46.660 --> 00:00:46.670 
slider piece actually the two little

00:00:46.670 --> 00:00:49.069 
slider piece actually the two little
fittings<00:00:47.670> fit<00:00:47.969> in<00:00:48.120> there<00:00:48.329> from<00:00:48.539> the<00:00:48.600> bottom<00:00:48.989> of

00:00:49.069 --> 00:00:49.079 
fittings fit in there from the bottom of

00:00:49.079 --> 00:00:51.680 
fittings fit in there from the bottom of
the<00:00:49.170> door<00:00:49.379> and<00:00:50.030> then<00:00:51.030> I<00:00:51.059> guess<00:00:51.390> when<00:00:51.600> they

00:00:51.680 --> 00:00:51.690 
the door and then I guess when they

00:00:51.690 --> 00:00:53.479 
the door and then I guess when they
assemble<00:00:52.140> it<00:00:52.260> in<00:00:52.710> the<00:00:52.800> factory<00:00:53.219> then<00:00:53.370> they

00:00:53.479 --> 00:00:53.489 
assemble it in the factory then they

00:00:53.489 --> 00:00:56.060 
assemble it in the factory then they
close<00:00:53.789> it<00:00:54.030> like<00:00:54.690> that<00:00:54.960> maybe<00:00:55.590> from<00:00:55.770> the<00:00:55.920> back

00:00:56.060 --> 00:00:56.070 
close it like that maybe from the back

00:00:56.070 --> 00:00:58.610 
close it like that maybe from the back
end<00:00:56.100> and<00:00:56.550> what<00:00:57.449> I've<00:00:57.570> found<00:00:57.809> is<00:00:58.079> another<00:00:58.350> video

00:00:58.610 --> 00:00:58.620 
end and what I've found is another video

00:00:58.620 --> 00:01:02.119 
end and what I've found is another video
online<00:00:58.829> where<00:00:59.640> on<00:01:00.149> the<00:01:00.359> back<00:01:00.539> side<00:01:00.809> we<00:01:01.770> can

00:01:02.119 --> 00:01:02.129 
online where on the back side we can

00:01:02.129 --> 00:01:05.210 
online where on the back side we can
remove<00:01:02.399> this<00:01:02.670> and<00:01:03.270> get<00:01:04.080> at<00:01:04.229> it<00:01:04.260> through<00:01:05.100> the

00:01:05.210 --> 00:01:05.220 
remove this and get at it through the

00:01:05.220 --> 00:01:07.429 
remove this and get at it through the
door<00:01:05.430> and<00:01:05.760> hope<00:01:06.150> my<00:01:06.450> hope<00:01:06.600> is<00:01:06.810> that<00:01:06.840> I<00:01:07.080> can<00:01:07.140> get

00:01:07.429 --> 00:01:07.439 
door and hope my hope is that I can get

00:01:07.439 --> 00:01:10.399 
door and hope my hope is that I can get
a<00:01:07.470> pick<00:01:07.710> through<00:01:08.070> and<00:01:08.720> get<00:01:09.720> it<00:01:09.750> right<00:01:10.049> in<00:01:10.200> there

00:01:10.399 --> 00:01:10.409 
a pick through and get it right in there

00:01:10.409 --> 00:01:13.840 
a pick through and get it right in there
and<00:01:10.619> pull<00:01:11.040> it<00:01:11.189> tight<00:01:11.460> once<00:01:12.030> it's<00:01:12.180> closed<00:01:12.510> so

00:01:13.840 --> 00:01:13.850 
and pull it tight once it's closed so

00:01:13.850 --> 00:01:17.359 
and pull it tight once it's closed so
that's<00:01:14.850> my<00:01:15.060> plan<00:01:15.270> and<00:01:15.540> if<00:01:16.290> it<00:01:16.439> works<00:01:16.619> I'll<00:01:17.009> post

00:01:39.380 --> 00:01:39.390 
hope I will be able to feel and then I

00:01:39.390 --> 00:01:43.010 
hope I will be able to feel and then I
will<00:01:39.630> hook<00:01:39.930> this<00:01:40.320> and<00:01:40.939> pull<00:01:41.939> it<00:01:42.030> tight<00:01:42.210> and<00:01:42.570> if

00:01:43.010 --> 00:01:43.020

00:01:45.260 --> 00:01:45.270 
I can pull it tight should look like

00:01:45.270 --> 00:01:46.760 
I can pull it tight should look like
that<00:01:45.420> when<00:01:45.780> it's<00:01:45.930> tight<00:01:46.110> and<00:01:46.290> then<00:01:46.500> I<00:01:46.590> should

00:01:46.760 --> 00:01:46.770 
that when it's tight and then I should

00:01:46.770 --> 00:01:52.760 
that when it's tight and then I should
be<00:01:46.860> able<00:01:46.950> to<00:01:47.130> open<00:01:47.430> and<00:01:47.490> close<00:01:47.640> my<00:01:47.790> door<00:01:51.530> so<00:01:52.530> but

having some trouble getting the door to

00:01:55.170 --> 00:01:58.520 
having some trouble getting the door to
fit<00:01:55.649> and<00:01:55.909> actuate<00:01:56.909> properly<00:01:57.450> and<00:01:57.659> so<00:01:58.049> I<00:01:58.409> know

00:02:02.469 --> 00:02:02.479 
that the way to actuate the door is by

00:02:02.479 --> 00:02:05.300 
that the way to actuate the door is by
let's<00:02:03.479> see<00:02:03.570> they're<00:02:03.719> not<00:02:03.869> just<00:02:04.829> by<00:02:04.979> hitting

00:02:05.300 --> 00:02:05.310 
let's see they're not just by hitting

00:02:05.310 --> 00:02:07.490 
let's see they're not just by hitting
this<00:02:06.060> right<00:02:06.360> here<00:02:06.659> and<00:02:06.810> making<00:02:07.020> that<00:02:07.140> go<00:02:07.290> up

00:02:07.490 --> 00:02:07.500 
this right here and making that go up

00:02:07.500 --> 00:02:09.180 
this right here and making that go up
like<00:02:08.310> that

00:02:09.180 --> 00:02:09.190 
like that

00:02:09.190 --> 00:02:12.630 
like that
so<00:02:10.150> I<00:02:10.180> haven't<00:02:10.330> figured<00:02:10.510> out<00:02:10.660> how<00:02:10.750> to<00:02:10.780> get<00:02:11.740> this

00:02:12.630 --> 00:02:12.640 
so I haven't figured out how to get this

00:02:12.640 --> 00:02:15.240 
so I haven't figured out how to get this
little<00:02:12.970> thing<00:02:13.270> to<00:02:13.570> align<00:02:13.900> with<00:02:14.050> that<00:02:14.110> yet<00:02:14.470> what

00:02:15.240 --> 00:02:15.250 
little thing to align with that yet what

00:02:15.250 --> 00:02:17.520 
little thing to align with that yet what
I<00:02:15.280> did<00:02:15.460> do<00:02:15.640> so<00:02:15.850> far<00:02:16.090> is<00:02:16.330> I<00:02:16.450> put<00:02:16.690> some<00:02:17.020> I<00:02:17.050> figured

00:02:17.520 --> 00:02:17.530 
I did do so far is I put some I figured

00:02:17.530 --> 00:02:19.560 
I did do so far is I put some I figured
out<00:02:17.650> that<00:02:17.710> the<00:02:17.980> dental<00:02:18.430> pick<00:02:18.880> thing<00:02:19.180> I<00:02:19.300> wasn't

00:02:19.560 --> 00:02:19.570 
out that the dental pick thing I wasn't

00:02:19.570 --> 00:02:21.030 
out that the dental pick thing I wasn't
gonna<00:02:19.720> work<00:02:19.840> so<00:02:19.990> I<00:02:20.050> put<00:02:20.320> a<00:02:20.350> little<00:02:20.620> thread<00:02:20.890> in

00:02:21.030 --> 00:02:21.040 
gonna work so I put a little thread in

00:02:21.040 --> 00:02:23.490 
gonna work so I put a little thread in
there<00:02:21.160> and<00:02:21.940> probably<00:02:22.090> see<00:02:22.390> it<00:02:22.510> and<00:02:22.720> I've<00:02:23.470> got

00:02:23.490 --> 00:02:23.500 
there and probably see it and I've got

00:02:23.500 --> 00:02:25.680 
there and probably see it and I've got
the<00:02:23.800> thread<00:02:24.100> all<00:02:24.790> ready<00:02:25.090> to<00:02:25.270> go

00:02:25.680 --> 00:02:25.690 
the thread all ready to go

00:02:25.690 --> 00:02:28.020 
the thread all ready to go
so<00:02:26.200> the<00:02:26.290> idea<00:02:26.560> is<00:02:26.770> that<00:02:26.950> once<00:02:27.160> I<00:02:27.250> do<00:02:27.310> get<00:02:27.610> it<00:02:27.790> all

00:02:28.020 --> 00:02:28.030 
so the idea is that once I do get it all

00:02:28.030 --> 00:02:29.580 
so the idea is that once I do get it all
I<00:02:28.090> have<00:02:28.270> to<00:02:28.390> do<00:02:28.480> is<00:02:28.570> pull<00:02:28.810> that<00:02:29.050> and<00:02:29.290> that<00:02:29.440> will

00:02:29.580 --> 00:02:29.590 
I have to do is pull that and that will

00:02:29.590 --> 00:02:31.680 
I have to do is pull that and that will
lock<00:02:29.770> it<00:02:29.950> in<00:02:30.040> place<00:02:30.190> so<00:02:30.520> we'll<00:02:31.360> see<00:02:31.540> how<00:02:31.630> that

00:02:31.680 --> 00:02:31.690 
lock it in place so we'll see how that

00:02:31.690 --> 00:03:43.960 
lock it in place so we'll see how that
goes

00:03:43.960 --> 00:03:43.970 

00:03:43.970 --> 00:03:45.289 

moment<00:03:44.970> of<00:03:45.000> truth

00:03:45.289 --> 00:03:45.299 
moment of truth

00:03:45.299 --> 00:03:56.720 
moment of truth
Oh<00:03:49.879> victory<00:03:52.909> Wow<00:03:53.909> and<00:03:54.860> the<00:03:55.860> cord<00:03:56.099> broke<00:03:56.340> just

00:03:56.720 --> 00:03:56.730 
Oh victory Wow and the cord broke just

00:03:56.730 --> 00:04:00.640 
Oh victory Wow and the cord broke just
at<00:03:56.819> the<00:03:56.879> right<00:03:57.000> time<00:03:57.739> Amador<00:03:58.739> is<00:03:58.859> working

00:04:00.640 --> 00:04:00.650 
at the right time Amador is working

00:04:00.650 --> 00:04:03.650 
at the right time Amador is working
success
