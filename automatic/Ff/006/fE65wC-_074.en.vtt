00:02:54.059 --> 00:02:54.069 
I think that make road safe compete and

00:02:54.069 --> 00:02:56.580 
I think that make road safe compete and
it's<00:02:54.250> all<00:02:54.400> about<00:02:54.520> how<00:02:55.390> to<00:02:55.450> behave<00:02:55.750> how<00:02:56.200> to

00:02:56.580 --> 00:02:56.590 
it's all about how to behave how to

00:02:56.590 --> 00:03:00.030 
it's all about how to behave how to
respect<00:02:56.920> the<00:02:57.220> rules<00:02:57.670> and<00:02:58.080> to<00:02:59.080> look<00:02:59.650> after<00:02:59.800> the

00:03:00.030 --> 00:03:00.040 
respect the rules and to look after the

00:03:00.040 --> 00:03:01.440 
respect the rules and to look after the
people<00:03:00.160> because<00:03:00.580> of<00:03:00.670> it<00:03:00.790> yes<00:03:00.940> I<00:03:01.060> can<00:03:01.209> cry<00:03:01.390> in

00:03:01.440 --> 00:03:01.450 
people because of it yes I can cry in

00:03:01.450 --> 00:03:03.120 
people because of it yes I can cry in
the<00:03:01.600> car<00:03:01.720> but<00:03:01.840> I'm<00:03:02.110> sure<00:03:02.500> that<00:03:02.709> because<00:03:02.920> people

00:03:03.120 --> 00:03:03.130 
the car but I'm sure that because people

00:03:03.130 --> 00:03:04.710 
the car but I'm sure that because people
know<00:03:03.459> it<00:03:03.640> so<00:03:03.910> I<00:03:03.970> don't<00:03:04.150> have<00:03:04.209> to<00:03:04.300> prove<00:03:04.480> them

00:03:04.710 --> 00:03:04.720 
know it so I don't have to prove them

00:03:04.720 --> 00:03:07.320 
know it so I don't have to prove them
all<00:03:04.990> the<00:03:05.560> road<00:03:05.709> traffic<00:03:05.950> absolutely<00:03:06.940> right<00:03:07.120> I

00:03:07.320 --> 00:03:07.330 
all the road traffic absolutely right I

00:03:07.330 --> 00:03:08.520 
all the road traffic absolutely right I
think<00:03:07.690> it<00:03:07.750> deserves<00:03:07.870> a<00:03:08.170> big<00:03:08.260> round<00:03:08.410> of

00:03:08.520 --> 00:03:08.530 
think it deserves a big round of

00:03:08.530 --> 00:03:11.370 
think it deserves a big round of
applause<00:03:08.739> for<00:03:08.950> that<00:03:09.010> okay<00:03:10.050> you<00:03:11.050> must<00:03:11.260> be

00:03:11.370 --> 00:03:11.380 
applause for that okay you must be

00:03:11.380 --> 00:03:13.740 
applause for that okay you must be
really<00:03:11.590> hard<00:03:11.970> traveling<00:03:12.970> around<00:03:13.209> the<00:03:13.360> track

00:03:13.740 --> 00:03:13.750 
really hard traveling around the track

00:03:13.750 --> 00:03:16.110 
really hard traveling around the track
at<00:03:13.780> breakneck<00:03:14.200> speed<00:03:14.709> and<00:03:15.040> when<00:03:15.640> you<00:03:15.760> drive<00:03:16.090> up

00:03:16.110 --> 00:03:16.120 
at breakneck speed and when you drive up

00:03:16.120 --> 00:03:18.180 
at breakneck speed and when you drive up
the<00:03:16.390> road<00:03:16.540> with<00:03:16.600> with<00:03:17.230> the<00:03:17.380> speed<00:03:17.709> limits<00:03:18.040> and

00:03:18.180 --> 00:03:18.190 
the road with with the speed limits and

00:03:18.190 --> 00:03:19.830 
the road with with the speed limits and
all<00:03:18.280> that<00:03:18.430> it<00:03:18.670> must<00:03:18.940> be<00:03:19.060> a<00:03:19.150> bit<00:03:19.480> difficult

00:03:19.830 --> 00:03:19.840 
all that it must be a bit difficult

00:03:19.840 --> 00:03:22.770 
all that it must be a bit difficult
though<00:03:20.470> because<00:03:20.770> I<00:03:21.040> have<00:03:21.300> every<00:03:22.300> second<00:03:22.630> week
