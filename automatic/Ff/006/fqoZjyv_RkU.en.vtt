00:02:53.030 --> 00:02:53.040 
preferred the Wii versions for years

00:02:53.040 --> 00:02:55.670 
preferred the Wii versions for years
because<00:02:53.430> of<00:02:53.459> the<00:02:53.730> motion<00:02:54.120> controls<00:02:54.570> and<00:02:54.840> now

00:02:55.670 --> 00:02:55.680

00:03:16.460 --> 00:03:16.470 
you need a lot of room to use the move

00:03:16.470 --> 00:03:19.130 
you need a lot of room to use the move
more<00:03:16.950> than<00:03:16.980> the<00:03:17.640> Wii<00:03:17.880> if<00:03:18.540> you<00:03:18.750> have<00:03:18.900> low

00:03:19.130 --> 00:03:19.140 
more than the Wii if you have low

more than the Wii if you have low

also<00:03:23.670> be<00:03:23.910> said<00:03:24.120> for<00:03:24.300> the<00:03:24.510> Wii<00:03:24.720> controllers<00:03:25.320> but

00:03:25.550 --> 00:03:25.560 
also be said for the Wii controllers but

00:03:25.560 --> 00:03:27.950 
also be said for the Wii controllers but
the<00:03:25.800> move<00:03:26.010> camera<00:03:26.400> generally<00:03:27.210> requires<00:03:27.720> you

00:03:27.950 --> 00:03:27.960 
the move camera generally requires you

00:03:27.960 --> 00:03:30.140 
the move camera generally requires you
to<00:03:27.990> stand<00:03:28.320> further<00:03:28.620> back<00:03:29.070> than<00:03:29.460> the<00:03:29.730> Wii<00:03:29.910> does

00:03:30.140 --> 00:03:30.150 
to stand further back than the Wii does

00:03:30.150 --> 00:03:33.290 
to stand further back than the Wii does
also<00:03:31.050> every<00:03:31.830> time<00:03:32.190> I<00:03:32.220> tried<00:03:32.670> to<00:03:32.700> swing<00:03:33.120> with

00:03:33.290 --> 00:03:33.300 
also every time I tried to swing with

00:03:33.300 --> 00:03:35.870 
also every time I tried to swing with
the<00:03:33.510> move<00:03:33.750> it<00:03:34.050> would<00:03:34.230> go<00:03:34.770> behind<00:03:35.190> my<00:03:35.400> back<00:03:35.430> on

00:03:35.870 --> 00:03:35.880 
the move it would go behind my back on

00:03:35.880 --> 00:03:37.610 
the move it would go behind my back on
whatever<00:03:36.210> you'd<00:03:36.510> call<00:03:36.720> that<00:03:36.750> the<00:03:37.050> backswing

00:03:37.610 --> 00:03:37.620 
whatever you'd call that the backswing

00:03:37.620 --> 00:03:39.500 
whatever you'd call that the backswing
and<00:03:37.680> lose<00:03:38.100> sight<00:03:38.340> of<00:03:38.370> it<00:03:38.580> and<00:03:38.760> then<00:03:39.150> then<00:03:39.420> it

00:03:39.500 --> 00:03:39.510 
and lose sight of it and then then it

00:03:39.510 --> 00:03:41.060 
and lose sight of it and then then it
would<00:03:39.630> see<00:03:39.810> it<00:03:39.900> again<00:03:40.170> and<00:03:40.530> it<00:03:40.740> was<00:03:40.800> kind<00:03:41.010> of

00:03:41.060 --> 00:03:41.070 
would see it again and it was kind of

00:03:41.070 --> 00:03:43.220 
would see it again and it was kind of
jerky<00:03:41.520> and<00:03:41.730> something<00:03:42.510> I<00:03:42.570> bet<00:03:42.750> it<00:03:42.900> didn't

00:03:43.220 --> 00:03:43.230 
jerky and something I bet it didn't

00:03:43.230 --> 00:03:45.770 
jerky and something I bet it didn't
didn't<00:03:43.920> seem<00:03:44.160> right<00:03:44.400> dad<00:03:44.940> it's<00:03:45.270> like<00:03:45.360> somebody

00:03:45.770 --> 00:03:45.780 
didn't seem right dad it's like somebody

00:03:45.780 --> 00:03:48.350 
didn't seem right dad it's like somebody
didn't<00:03:46.080> think<00:03:46.260> ahead<00:03:46.380> of<00:03:46.500> time<00:03:46.770> so<00:03:47.060> so<00:03:48.060> if<00:03:48.210> the

00:03:48.350 --> 00:03:48.360 
didn't think ahead of time so so if the

00:03:48.360 --> 00:03:50.240 
didn't think ahead of time so so if the
camera<00:03:48.870> can't<00:03:49.140> see<00:03:49.230> the<00:03:49.500> move<00:03:49.710> it<00:03:49.890> won't<00:03:50.070> work

00:03:50.240 --> 00:03:50.250 
camera can't see the move it won't work

00:03:50.250 --> 00:03:52.160 
camera can't see the move it won't work
ah<00:03:50.640> I<00:03:51.420> didn't<00:03:51.720> think<00:03:51.750> of<00:03:51.960> that

00:03:52.160 --> 00:03:52.170 
ah I didn't think of that

00:03:52.170 --> 00:03:54.410 
ah I didn't think of that
well<00:03:52.380> we'll<00:03:52.830> change<00:03:53.130> that<00:03:53.220> with<00:03:53.580> the<00:03:53.730> move<00:03:53.970> to

00:03:54.410 --> 00:03:54.420 
well we'll change that with the move to

00:03:54.420 --> 00:03:56.690 
well we'll change that with the move to
where<00:03:54.810> the<00:03:55.260> controller<00:03:55.650> will<00:03:55.890> also<00:03:56.280> emit<00:03:56.670> a

00:03:56.690 --> 00:03:56.700 
where the controller will also emit a

00:03:56.700 --> 00:03:59.630 
where the controller will also emit a
very<00:03:57.180> high-pitched<00:03:57.720> squealing<00:03:58.440> sound<00:03:58.890> so<00:03:59.520> the

00:03:59.630 --> 00:03:59.640 
very high-pitched squealing sound so the

00:03:59.640 --> 00:04:01.930 
very high-pitched squealing sound so the
camera<00:04:00.030> can<00:04:00.090> hear<00:04:00.660> it<00:04:00.780> as<00:04:00.990> well<00:04:01.050> as<00:04:01.440> see<00:04:01.650> it

00:04:01.930 --> 00:04:01.940 
camera can hear it as well as see it

00:04:01.940 --> 00:04:04.850 
camera can hear it as well as see it
yeah<00:04:02.940> that'll<00:04:03.540> work<00:04:03.570> late<00:04:03.870> then<00:04:04.500> you<00:04:04.650> can't

00:04:04.850 --> 00:04:04.860 
yeah that'll work late then you can't

00:04:04.860 --> 00:04:06.590 
yeah that'll work late then you can't
hear<00:04:05.010> the<00:04:05.160> game<00:04:05.190> damn<00:04:05.700> it<00:04:05.910> well<00:04:06.000> fix<00:04:06.240> that<00:04:06.450> in

00:04:06.590 --> 00:04:06.600

00:04:06.600 --> 00:04:09.140 
hear the game damn it well fix that in
the<00:04:06.630> move<00:04:06.870> three<00:04:07.230> where<00:04:08.130> the<00:04:08.430> controller<00:04:08.880> will

00:04:09.140 --> 00:04:09.150 
the move three where the controller will

00:04:09.150 --> 00:04:11.390 
the move three where the controller will
actually<00:04:09.720> have<00:04:09.900> a<00:04:09.930> wire<00:04:10.380> connected<00:04:11.220> to<00:04:11.250> the

00:04:11.390 --> 00:04:11.400
