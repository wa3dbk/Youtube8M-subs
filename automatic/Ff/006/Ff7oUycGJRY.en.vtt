00:01:05.030 --> 00:01:05.040 

00:01:05.040 --> 00:01:13.340 

it's<00:01:05.580> over<00:01:05.790> here<00:01:05.910> by<00:01:06.030> seevis

00:01:20.940 --> 00:01:20.950 

00:01:20.950 --> 00:01:23.130 

the<00:01:21.490> water<00:01:21.700> is<00:01:21.880> all<00:01:22.030> over<00:01:22.180> my<00:01:22.390> hands<00:01:22.689> in<00:01:22.930> fact

00:01:23.130 --> 00:01:23.140 
the water is all over my hands in fact

00:01:23.140 --> 00:01:24.990 
the water is all over my hands in fact
it<00:01:23.259> rings<00:01:23.530> out<00:01:23.770> of<00:01:23.799> the<00:01:23.979> cloth<00:01:24.220> into<00:01:24.549> my<00:01:24.670> hands

00:01:24.990 --> 00:01:25.000 
it rings out of the cloth into my hands

00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:29.990 
it rings out of the cloth into my hands
and<00:01:25.210> if<00:01:25.479> I<00:01:25.570> let<00:01:25.810> go<00:01:26.020> of<00:01:26.140> the<00:01:26.200> cloth<00:01:26.439> carefully

00:01:29.990 --> 00:01:30.000 

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:32.210 

the<00:01:30.390> water<00:01:30.660> sort<00:01:31.080> of<00:01:31.170> has<00:01:31.350> it<00:01:31.530> sticked<00:01:31.950> to<00:01:32.100> my

00:01:32.210 --> 00:01:32.220 
the water sort of has it sticked to my

00:01:32.220 --> 00:01:35.030 
the water sort of has it sticked to my
hand<00:01:32.960> the<00:01:33.960> surface<00:01:34.380> tension<00:01:34.800> of<00:01:34.890> the<00:01:34.950> water

00:01:35.030 --> 00:01:35.040 
hand the surface tension of the water

00:01:35.040 --> 00:01:47.459 
hand the surface tension of the water
keeps<00:01:36.030> it<00:01:36.240> stuck<00:01:36.720> to<00:01:37.110> my<00:01:37.230> hand<00:01:37.580> Thanks

00:01:47.459 --> 00:01:47.469 

00:01:47.469 --> 00:01:50.459 

we<00:01:47.859> have<00:01:48.070> a<00:01:48.100> microphone<00:01:49.079> okay<00:01:50.079> so<00:01:50.140> the

00:01:50.459 --> 00:01:50.469 
we have a microphone okay so the

00:01:50.469 --> 00:01:52.739 
we have a microphone okay so the
experiment<00:01:51.340> worked<00:01:51.490> beautifully<00:01:52.210> and<00:01:52.420> the

00:01:52.739 --> 00:01:52.749 
experiment worked beautifully and the

00:01:52.749 --> 00:01:54.569 
experiment worked beautifully and the
answer<00:01:53.049> to<00:01:53.140> the<00:01:53.229> question<00:01:53.590> is<00:01:53.740> the<00:01:54.310> water

00:01:54.569 --> 00:01:54.579 
answer to the question is the water

00:01:54.579 --> 00:01:57.660 
answer to the question is the water
squeezes<00:01:55.329> out<00:01:55.509> of<00:01:55.750> the<00:01:55.840> cloth<00:01:56.140> and<00:01:56.670> then

00:01:57.660 --> 00:01:57.670 
squeezes out of the cloth and then

00:01:57.670 --> 00:01:59.459 
squeezes out of the cloth and then
because<00:01:58.149> of<00:01:58.179> the<00:01:58.420> surface<00:01:58.869> tension<00:01:59.140> of<00:01:59.409> the

00:01:59.459 --> 00:01:59.469 
because of the surface tension of the

00:01:59.469 --> 00:02:03.300 
because of the surface tension of the
water<00:01:59.679> it<00:02:00.750> it<00:02:01.750> actually<00:02:01.929> runs<00:02:02.380> along<00:02:03.039> the

00:02:03.300 --> 00:02:03.310 
water it it actually runs along the

00:02:03.310 --> 00:02:05.429 
water it it actually runs along the
surface<00:02:03.549> of<00:02:03.909> the<00:02:04.000> cloth<00:02:04.270> and<00:02:04.479> then<00:02:04.929> up<00:02:05.049> into<00:02:05.229> my

00:02:05.429 --> 00:02:05.439 
surface of the cloth and then up into my

00:02:05.439 --> 00:02:08.759 
surface of the cloth and then up into my
hand<00:02:05.789> almost<00:02:06.789> like<00:02:07.000> you<00:02:07.149> had<00:02:07.379> jello<00:02:08.379> on<00:02:08.500> your

00:02:08.759 --> 00:02:08.769 
hand almost like you had jello on your

00:02:08.769 --> 00:02:10.949 
hand almost like you had jello on your
hands<00:02:09.099> or<00:02:09.220> gel<00:02:09.489> in<00:02:09.640> your<00:02:09.670> hand<00:02:10.030> and<00:02:10.569> it'll<00:02:10.810> just

00:02:10.949 --> 00:02:10.959 
hands or gel in your hand and it'll just

00:02:10.959 --> 00:02:11.550 
hands or gel in your hand and it'll just
stay<00:02:11.170> there

00:02:11.550 --> 00:02:11.560 
stay there

00:02:11.560 --> 00:02:14.070 
stay there
wonderful<00:02:12.250> moisturizer<00:02:12.940> in<00:02:13.510> my<00:02:13.629> hands<00:02:13.900> and

00:02:14.070 --> 00:02:14.080 
wonderful moisturizer in my hands and

00:02:14.080 --> 00:02:17.130 
wonderful moisturizer in my hands and
the<00:02:14.950> cloth<00:02:15.190> doesn't<00:02:16.000> really<00:02:16.209> unravel<00:02:16.569> itself

00:02:17.130 --> 00:02:17.140 
the cloth doesn't really unravel itself

00:02:17.140 --> 00:02:20.670 
the cloth doesn't really unravel itself
it<00:02:17.799> just<00:02:18.040> stays<00:02:18.280> there<00:02:18.420> floating<00:02:19.420> like<00:02:19.629> a<00:02:19.680> like

00:02:20.670 --> 00:02:20.680 
it just stays there floating like a like
