than the surface with Windows RT there

00:00:49.960 --> 00:00:51.810

at<00:00:50.170> least<00:00:50.320> as<00:00:50.559> far<00:00:50.800> as<00:00:50.920> this<00:00:51.040> browser<00:00:51.280> test<00:00:51.670> is

at least as far as this browser test is
concerned<00:00:52.149> and<00:00:52.239> I<00:00:52.329> believe<00:00:52.600> that<00:00:53.010> score<00:00:54.010> is

00:00:54.209 --> 00:00:54.219

00:00:54.219 --> 00:00:56.520 
concerned and I believe that score is
indicative<00:00:54.670> of<00:00:54.879> the<00:00:55.659> performance<00:00:56.110> I've<00:00:56.260> seen

in the entire experience on the surface
with<00:00:59.260> Windows<00:00:59.589> RT<00:00:59.769> i'll<00:01:00.640> let<00:01:00.850> the<00:01:00.969> results

those lenses are pointing you can see

00:02:10.239 --> 00:02:12.240 
those lenses are pointing you can see
the<00:02:10.390> massive<00:02:11.049> amount<00:02:11.290> of<00:02:11.530> purple<00:02:11.859> behind<00:02:12.160> me

the massive amount of purple behind me

00:02:12.250 --> 00:02:14.460 
the massive amount of purple behind me
and<00:02:12.310> trust<00:02:12.489> me<00:02:12.609> it's<00:02:13.540> nothing<00:02:13.840> but<00:02:13.959> red<00:02:14.170> in

00:02:14.460 --> 00:02:14.470 
and trust me it's nothing but red in

00:02:16.530 --> 00:02:16.540 
terms of weight and size well I guess

00:02:16.540 --> 00:02:18.030

that's<00:02:16.720> just<00:02:16.810> down<00:02:17.140> to<00:02:17.290> your<00:02:17.380> preference<00:02:17.859> I

port<00:03:59.680> so<00:03:59.710> you<00:03:59.860> can<00:04:00.340> extend<00:04:01.300> its<00:04:01.660> storage

00:04:02.130 --> 00:04:02.140 
port so you can extend its storage

00:04:02.140 --> 00:04:03.870 
port so you can extend its storage
capacity<00:04:02.710> if<00:04:02.890> you<00:04:03.070> want<00:04:03.280> and<00:04:03.430> that<00:04:03.520> might<00:04:03.700> be

00:04:03.870 --> 00:04:03.880 
capacity if you want and that might be

00:04:03.880 --> 00:04:06.300 
capacity if you want and that might be
wise<00:04:04.060> whereas<00:04:04.780> the<00:04:04.960> iPad<00:04:05.290> well<00:04:05.560> as<00:04:05.710> we<00:04:06.160> know

00:04:06.300 --> 00:04:06.310 
wise whereas the iPad well as we know

00:04:06.310 --> 00:04:08.580 
wise whereas the iPad well as we know
you<00:04:06.370> can't<00:04:06.910> extend<00:04:07.420> it<00:04:07.570> effectively<00:04:08.050> that<00:04:08.380> way

00:04:08.580 --> 00:04:08.590 
you can't extend it effectively that way

00:04:08.590 --> 00:04:09.930 
you can't extend it effectively that way
that<00:04:08.920> being<00:04:09.130> said<00:04:09.340> I<00:04:09.400> was<00:04:09.580> a<00:04:09.610> little<00:04:09.910> taken

00:04:09.930 --> 00:04:09.940 
that being said I was a little taken

00:04:09.940 --> 00:04:12.000 
that being said I was a little taken
aback<00:04:10.330> and<00:04:10.990> I<00:04:11.230> mentioned<00:04:11.470> this<00:04:11.620> in<00:04:11.710> my<00:04:11.860> review

00:04:12.000 --> 00:04:12.010 
aback and I mentioned this in my review

00:04:12.010 --> 00:04:15.240 
aback and I mentioned this in my review
the<00:04:12.370> surface<00:04:13.060> with<00:04:13.360> Windows<00:04:13.660> RT<00:04:14.010> comes<00:04:15.010> with<00:04:15.220> a

00:04:15.240 --> 00:04:15.250 
the surface with Windows RT comes with a

however<00:04:18.660> 16<00:04:19.660> or<00:04:19.989> so<00:04:20.350> gigs<00:04:20.680> are<00:04:20.860> taken<00:04:21.100> up<00:04:21.220> by

however 16 or so gigs are taken up by

00:04:21.250 --> 00:04:24.600 
however 16 or so gigs are taken up by

00:04:24.600 --> 00:04:24.610 
the OS and default files so you are

00:04:24.610 --> 00:04:27.600 
the OS and default files so you are
really<00:04:24.760> buying<00:04:25.000> a<00:04:25.210> 16<00:04:25.660> gig<00:04:25.960> surface<00:04:26.680> I<00:04:26.890> mean

really buying a 16 gig surface I mean

really buying a 16 gig surface I mean
yes<00:04:27.790> there<00:04:28.210> is<00:04:28.480> certainly<00:04:28.960> space<00:04:29.260> being<00:04:29.530> taken

00:04:29.790 --> 00:04:29.800

less<00:04:35.590> of<00:04:35.860> a<00:04:35.950> footprint<00:04:36.400> on<00:04:36.640> iOS<00:04:37.210> compared<00:04:37.690> to

00:04:47.160 --> 00:04:47.170 
the surface with Windows RT and I think

00:04:47.170 --> 00:04:48.810 
the surface with Windows RT and I think
that's<00:04:47.290> really<00:04:47.590> what<00:04:47.860> matters<00:04:47.890> most<00:04:48.520> with

these types of devices I've always been

00:04:52.920 --> 00:04:52.930 
very happy with the iPad performance and

00:04:52.930 --> 00:04:55.530 
very happy with the iPad performance and
other<00:04:53.320> studies<00:04:53.590> have<00:04:53.890> shown<00:04:53.920> that<00:04:54.190> the<00:04:54.760> ipad<00:04:54.880> 4

apps in a good cohesive experience in
iOS<00:05:44.050> and<00:05:44.289> so<00:05:44.830> the<00:05:44.949> difference<00:05:45.220> between<00:05:45.759> the

00:05:45.870 --> 00:05:45.880

two<00:05:46.060> is<00:05:46.090> i<00:05:46.389> would<00:05:46.930> say<00:05:47.080> really<00:05:47.710> dramatic

00:05:48.150 --> 00:05:48.160 
two is i would say really dramatic

00:05:48.160 --> 00:05:49.950 
two is i would say really dramatic
especially<00:05:48.789> and<00:05:49.180> I<00:05:49.240> keep<00:05:49.419> coming<00:05:49.599> back<00:05:49.780> to

00:05:49.950 --> 00:05:49.960 
especially and I keep coming back to

00:05:49.960 --> 00:05:53.249 
especially and I keep coming back to
this<00:05:50.080> the<00:05:50.590> price<00:05:50.860> if<00:05:51.130> the<00:05:51.550> surface<00:05:52.000> was<00:05:52.259> two

00:05:53.249 --> 00:05:53.259 
this the price if the surface was two

00:05:53.259 --> 00:05:55.230 
this the price if the surface was two
hundred<00:05:53.289> dollars<00:05:53.860> it<00:05:54.280> might<00:05:54.699> be<00:05:54.910> worth<00:05:55.090> the

00:05:55.230 --> 00:05:55.240 
hundred dollars it might be worth the

00:05:55.240 --> 00:05:57.719 
hundred dollars it might be worth the
money<00:05:55.360> at<00:05:55.599> that<00:05:55.630> but<00:05:56.410> as<00:05:56.560> it<00:05:56.830> stands<00:05:57.130> at<00:05:57.400> this

00:05:57.719 --> 00:05:57.729 
money at that but as it stands at this

00:05:57.729 --> 00:06:00.480 
money at that but as it stands at this
point<00:05:58.060> in<00:05:58.180> time<00:05:58.300> there's<00:05:59.199> no<00:05:59.590> way<00:05:59.830> this

00:06:00.480 --> 00:06:00.490 
point in time there's no way this

00:06:00.490 --> 00:06:02.879 
point in time there's no way this
computer<00:06:00.970> is<00:06:01.240> worth<00:06:01.840> anywhere<00:06:02.380> near<00:06:02.440> five

00:06:02.879 --> 00:06:02.889 
computer is worth anywhere near five

00:06:02.889 --> 00:06:05.550 
computer is worth anywhere near five
hundred<00:06:03.220> dollars<00:06:03.550> great<00:06:04.120> hardware<00:06:04.930> but<00:06:05.440> I<00:06:05.470> do

00:06:05.550 --> 00:06:05.560 
hundred dollars great hardware but I do

00:06:05.560 --> 00:06:07.529 
hundred dollars great hardware but I do
believe<00:06:05.800> that<00:06:06.070> it's<00:06:06.220> currently<00:06:06.550> crippled<00:06:07.030> by

00:06:07.529 --> 00:06:07.539 
believe that it's currently crippled by

00:06:07.539 --> 00:06:10.920 
believe that it's currently crippled by
Windows<00:06:08.530> RT<00:06:08.770> and<00:06:09.340> we<00:06:10.180> will<00:06:10.360> see<00:06:10.570> what<00:06:10.780> happens

00:06:10.920 --> 00:06:10.930 
Windows RT and we will see what happens

00:06:10.930 --> 00:06:12.750 
Windows RT and we will see what happens
when<00:06:11.349> Windows<00:06:11.650> 8's<00:06:11.800> released<00:06:12.159> on<00:06:12.340> the<00:06:12.490> surface

it<00:06:12.880> may<00:06:13.150> be<00:06:13.210> the<00:06:13.599> similar<00:06:13.900> experience<00:06:14.440> may<00:06:14.590> be
