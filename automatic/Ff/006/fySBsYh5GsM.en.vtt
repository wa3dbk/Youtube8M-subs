hello<00:00:00.659> everyone<00:00:00.960> my<00:00:01.170> name<00:00:01.350> is<00:00:01.380> Tyler<00:00:01.770> and<00:00:02.190> this

00:00:02.360 --> 00:00:02.370 
hello everyone my name is Tyler and this

00:00:02.370 --> 00:00:04.789 
hello everyone my name is Tyler and this
week<00:00:02.639> I'll<00:00:02.970> be<00:00:03.000> showing<00:00:03.210> you<00:00:03.689> how<00:00:04.380> to<00:00:04.410> create<00:00:04.740> a

00:00:04.789 --> 00:00:04.799 
week I'll be showing you how to create a

00:00:04.799 --> 00:00:07.639 
week I'll be showing you how to create a
kind<00:00:05.009> of<00:00:05.220> basic<00:00:05.850> fireworks<00:00:06.629> particle<00:00:07.290> system

00:00:07.639 --> 00:00:07.649 
kind of basic fireworks particle system

00:00:07.649 --> 00:00:09.140 
kind of basic fireworks particle system
in<00:00:07.799> unity<00:00:08.130> using<00:00:08.519> the<00:00:08.639> particle<00:00:09.030> system

00:00:09.140 --> 00:00:09.150 
in unity using the particle system

00:00:09.150 --> 00:00:11.299 
in unity using the particle system
editor<00:00:09.690> this<00:00:10.530> is<00:00:10.650> the<00:00:10.769> kind<00:00:10.950> of<00:00:11.010> effect<00:00:11.250> that

00:00:11.299 --> 00:00:11.309 
editor this is the kind of effect that

00:00:11.309 --> 00:00:13.370 
editor this is the kind of effect that
we'll<00:00:11.550> be<00:00:11.670> creating<00:00:12.090> today<00:00:12.269> it<00:00:13.019> kind<00:00:13.259> of

00:00:13.370 --> 00:00:13.380 
we'll be creating today it kind of

00:00:13.380 --> 00:00:15.860 
we'll be creating today it kind of
mimics<00:00:13.559> other<00:00:14.370> fireworks<00:00:15.030> by<00:00:15.330> having<00:00:15.690> like<00:00:15.839> a

00:00:15.860 --> 00:00:15.870 
mimics other fireworks by having like a

00:00:15.870 --> 00:00:18.320 
mimics other fireworks by having like a
little<00:00:16.049> trail<00:00:16.379> and<00:00:16.650> then<00:00:16.740> an<00:00:16.859> explosion<00:00:17.400> so

00:00:18.320 --> 00:00:18.330 
little trail and then an explosion so

00:00:18.330 --> 00:00:20.000 
little trail and then an explosion so
you<00:00:18.390> can<00:00:18.510> kind<00:00:18.690> of<00:00:18.750> build<00:00:18.930> off<00:00:19.020> this<00:00:19.380> to<00:00:19.710> either

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:20.010 
you can kind of build off this to either

00:00:20.010 --> 00:00:21.439 
you can kind of build off this to either
create<00:00:20.369> your<00:00:20.400> own<00:00:20.520> unique<00:00:20.880> effects<00:00:21.240> that<00:00:21.390> are

00:00:21.439 --> 00:00:21.449 
create your own unique effects that are

00:00:21.449 --> 00:00:22.730 
create your own unique effects that are
either<00:00:21.600> more<00:00:21.840> colorful<00:00:22.320> have<00:00:22.560> more

00:00:22.730 --> 00:00:22.740 
either more colorful have more

00:00:22.740 --> 00:00:24.290 
either more colorful have more
interesting<00:00:23.130> behaviors<00:00:23.580> and<00:00:23.880> firing<00:00:24.240> off

00:00:24.290 --> 00:00:24.300 
interesting behaviors and firing off

00:00:24.300 --> 00:00:27.259 
interesting behaviors and firing off
particles<00:00:24.810> constantly<00:00:25.320> or<00:00:26.090> just<00:00:27.090> whatever

00:00:27.259 --> 00:00:27.269 
particles constantly or just whatever

00:00:27.269 --> 00:00:28.730 
particles constantly or just whatever
you<00:00:27.510> can<00:00:27.660> think<00:00:27.750> of<00:00:27.900> but<00:00:28.170> this<00:00:28.260> is<00:00:28.410> kind<00:00:28.590> of<00:00:28.650> a

00:00:28.730 --> 00:00:28.740 
you can think of but this is kind of a

00:00:28.740 --> 00:00:30.589 
you can think of but this is kind of a
basic<00:00:29.099> system<00:00:29.670> that<00:00:30.029> you<00:00:30.119> can<00:00:30.240> work<00:00:30.359> off<00:00:30.570> of

00:00:30.589 --> 00:00:30.599 
basic system that you can work off of

00:00:30.599 --> 00:00:32.389 
basic system that you can work off of
and<00:00:30.960> kind<00:00:31.140> of<00:00:31.260> shows<00:00:31.439> the<00:00:31.679> basic<00:00:31.830> animation

00:00:32.389 --> 00:00:32.399 
and kind of shows the basic animation

00:00:32.399 --> 00:00:34.340 
and kind of shows the basic animation
for<00:00:32.550> articles<00:00:32.880> so<00:00:33.510> let's<00:00:33.690> move<00:00:33.870> that<00:00:34.079> to<00:00:34.140> the

00:00:34.340 --> 00:00:34.350 
for articles so let's move that to the

00:00:34.350 --> 00:00:36.860 
for articles so let's move that to the
side<00:00:34.380> and<00:00:34.649> then<00:00:35.010> make<00:00:35.190> one<00:00:35.579> of<00:00:35.790> our<00:00:35.940> own<00:00:36.000> so<00:00:36.540> we

00:00:36.860 --> 00:00:36.870 
side and then make one of our own so we

00:00:36.870 --> 00:00:40.130 
side and then make one of our own so we
can<00:00:37.440> show<00:00:37.829> you<00:00:37.860> how<00:00:38.280> to<00:00:38.340> do<00:00:38.520> that<00:00:38.809> let's<00:00:39.809> reset

00:00:40.130 --> 00:00:40.140 
can show you how to do that let's reset

00:00:40.140 --> 00:00:41.600 
can show you how to do that let's reset
the<00:00:40.290> positions<00:00:40.770> we<00:00:41.010> don't<00:00:41.160> have<00:00:41.250> to<00:00:41.340> move<00:00:41.489> the

00:00:41.600 --> 00:00:41.610 
the positions we don't have to move the

00:00:41.610 --> 00:00:44.600 
the positions we don't have to move the
camera<00:00:41.820> too<00:00:42.090> much<00:00:43.100> let's<00:00:44.100> decrease<00:00:44.489> the

00:00:44.600 --> 00:00:44.610 
camera too much let's decrease the

00:00:44.610 --> 00:00:46.970 
camera too much let's decrease the
lifetime<00:00:45.270> because<00:00:45.629> particles<00:00:45.930> kind<00:00:46.770> of<00:00:46.829> fire

00:00:46.970 --> 00:00:46.980 
lifetime because particles kind of fire

00:00:46.980 --> 00:00:49.190 
lifetime because particles kind of fire
off<00:00:47.160> very<00:00:47.399> quickly<00:00:47.670> and<00:00:48.030> then<00:00:48.690> since<00:00:48.989> they<00:00:49.140> are

00:00:49.190 --> 00:00:49.200 
off very quickly and then since they are

00:00:49.200 --> 00:00:50.750 
off very quickly and then since they are
firing<00:00:49.559> off<00:00:49.800> very<00:00:50.039> quickly<00:00:50.309> we<00:00:50.550> need<00:00:50.579> to

00:00:50.750 --> 00:00:50.760 
firing off very quickly we need to

00:00:50.760 --> 00:00:53.990 
firing off very quickly we need to
change<00:00:50.969> the<00:00:51.239> starting<00:00:51.750> speed<00:00:52.050> and<00:00:52.289> it's<00:00:52.969> for<00:00:53.969> a

00:00:53.990 --> 00:00:54.000 
change the starting speed and it's for a

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:55.970 
change the starting speed and it's for a
little<00:00:54.180> bit<00:00:54.300> of<00:00:54.420> variability<00:00:54.719> we<00:00:55.170> can<00:00:55.350> have

00:00:55.970 --> 00:00:55.980 
little bit of variability we can have

00:00:55.980 --> 00:00:59.000 
little bit of variability we can have
the<00:00:56.430> unity<00:00:57.210> basically<00:00:57.660> choose<00:00:57.899> any<00:00:58.289> speed

00:00:59.000 --> 00:00:59.010 
the unity basically choose any speed

00:00:59.010 --> 00:01:00.590 
the unity basically choose any speed
between<00:00:59.190> these<00:00:59.550> two<00:00:59.760> constants<00:01:00.180> beats<00:01:00.390> a<00:01:00.510> we

00:01:00.590 --> 00:01:00.600 
between these two constants beats a we

00:01:00.600 --> 00:01:00.860 
between these two constants beats a we
can

00:01:00.860 --> 00:01:00.870 
can

00:01:00.870 --> 00:01:03.319 
can
let's<00:01:01.199> give<00:01:01.410> it<00:01:01.440> a<00:01:01.739> relatively<00:01:02.699> fast<00:01:02.969> speed

00:01:03.319 --> 00:01:03.329 
let's give it a relatively fast speed

00:01:03.329 --> 00:01:06.080 
let's give it a relatively fast speed
and<00:01:03.359> a<00:01:03.629> pretty<00:01:04.080> dang<00:01:04.290> fast<00:01:04.530> speed<00:01:05.309> let's

00:01:06.080 --> 00:01:06.090 
and a pretty dang fast speed let's

00:01:06.090 --> 00:01:08.570 
and a pretty dang fast speed let's
change<00:01:06.360> the<00:01:06.570> size<00:01:06.780> just<00:01:07.320> so<00:01:07.380> we<00:01:07.470> can<00:01:07.619> see<00:01:07.860> the

00:01:08.570 --> 00:01:08.580 
change the size just so we can see the

00:01:08.580 --> 00:01:12.740 
change the size just so we can see the
particles<00:01:08.820> a<00:01:09.390> little<00:01:09.900> bit<00:01:10.049> more<00:01:11.659> we<00:01:12.659> don't

00:01:12.740 --> 00:01:12.750 
particles a little bit more we don't

00:01:12.750 --> 00:01:14.210 
particles a little bit more we don't
really<00:01:12.900> need<00:01:13.110> a<00:01:13.170> gravity<00:01:13.530> multiplier<00:01:13.950> since

00:01:14.210 --> 00:01:14.220 
really need a gravity multiplier since

00:01:14.220 --> 00:01:15.560 
really need a gravity multiplier since
we<00:01:14.340> want<00:01:14.520> them<00:01:14.610> to<00:01:14.640> be<00:01:14.820> shooting<00:01:14.970> up<00:01:15.210> and<00:01:15.420> not

00:01:15.560 --> 00:01:15.570 
we want them to be shooting up and not

00:01:15.570 --> 00:01:18.050 
we want them to be shooting up and not
kind<00:01:15.780> of<00:01:15.900> having<00:01:16.380> this<00:01:16.530> downward<00:01:16.950> force<00:01:17.280> on

00:01:18.050 --> 00:01:18.060 
kind of having this downward force on

00:01:18.060 --> 00:01:20.120 
kind of having this downward force on
them<00:01:18.630> all<00:01:18.720> the<00:01:18.840> time<00:01:19.080> we<00:01:19.619> are<00:01:19.710> going<00:01:19.890> to<00:01:19.979> want

00:01:20.120 --> 00:01:20.130 
them all the time we are going to want

00:01:20.130 --> 00:01:21.859 
them all the time we are going to want
to<00:01:20.189> change<00:01:20.460> the<00:01:20.700> emission<00:01:21.060> instead<00:01:21.659> of<00:01:21.750> a

00:01:21.859 --> 00:01:21.869 
to change the emission instead of a

00:01:21.869 --> 00:01:23.630 
to change the emission instead of a
concentrate<00:01:22.560> and<00:01:22.770> we<00:01:22.860> want<00:01:23.009> it<00:01:23.130> to<00:01:23.250> be<00:01:23.340> kind<00:01:23.580> of

00:01:23.630 --> 00:01:23.640 
concentrate and we want it to be kind of

00:01:23.640 --> 00:01:25.100 
concentrate and we want it to be kind of
more<00:01:23.850> of<00:01:23.909> a<00:01:24.000> burst<00:01:24.210> so<00:01:24.509> you<00:01:24.600> can<00:01:24.720> kind<00:01:24.900> of<00:01:24.930> see

00:01:25.100 --> 00:01:25.110 
more of a burst so you can kind of see

00:01:25.110 --> 00:01:27.350 
more of a burst so you can kind of see
it<00:01:25.200> and<00:01:25.470> so<00:01:26.189> we<00:01:26.310> can<00:01:26.520> kind<00:01:26.880> of<00:01:26.970> see<00:01:27.180> what's

00:01:27.350 --> 00:01:27.360 
it and so we can kind of see what's

00:01:27.360 --> 00:01:28.730 
it and so we can kind of see what's
going<00:01:27.420> on<00:01:27.659> a<00:01:27.720> little<00:01:27.869> bit<00:01:27.990> more<00:01:28.200> quickly<00:01:28.500> let's

00:01:28.730 --> 00:01:28.740 
going on a little bit more quickly let's

00:01:28.740 --> 00:01:31.039 
going on a little bit more quickly let's
change<00:01:28.950> the<00:01:29.130> durations<00:01:29.750> instead<00:01:30.750> of<00:01:30.869> five

00:01:31.039 --> 00:01:31.049 
change the durations instead of five

00:01:31.049 --> 00:01:33.679 
change the durations instead of five
seconds<00:01:31.409> to<00:01:31.560> two<00:01:31.710> seconds<00:01:32.189> so<00:01:33.000> we<00:01:33.119> can<00:01:33.299> kind<00:01:33.600> of

00:01:33.679 --> 00:01:33.689 
seconds to two seconds so we can kind of

00:01:33.689 --> 00:01:36.050 
seconds to two seconds so we can kind of
see<00:01:34.049> it<00:01:34.170> it'll<00:01:34.979> burst<00:01:35.220> every<00:01:35.579> two<00:01:35.729> seconds

00:01:36.050 --> 00:01:36.060 
see it it'll burst every two seconds

00:01:36.060 --> 00:01:38.929 
see it it'll burst every two seconds
instead<00:01:36.329> of<00:01:36.420> five<00:01:36.570> seconds<00:01:36.869> now<00:01:37.310> the<00:01:38.310> shape<00:01:38.520> is

00:01:38.929 --> 00:01:38.939 
instead of five seconds now the shape is

00:01:38.939 --> 00:01:40.060 
instead of five seconds now the shape is
perfectly<00:01:39.509> fine

00:01:40.060 --> 00:01:40.070 
perfectly fine

00:01:40.070 --> 00:01:43.090 
perfectly fine
works<00:01:40.550> for<00:01:40.790> what<00:01:40.909> we're<00:01:41.060> doing<00:01:41.770> so<00:01:42.770> we<00:01:42.920> can

00:01:43.090 --> 00:01:43.100 
works for what we're doing so we can

00:01:43.100 --> 00:01:45.040 
works for what we're doing so we can
give<00:01:43.370> our<00:01:43.970> particles<00:01:44.510> a<00:01:44.600> little<00:01:44.780> bit<00:01:44.900> more

00:01:45.040 --> 00:01:45.050 
give our particles a little bit more

00:01:45.050 --> 00:01:46.990 
give our particles a little bit more
interesting<00:01:45.530> kind<00:01:46.280> of<00:01:46.340> variation<00:01:46.820> by

00:01:46.990 --> 00:01:47.000 
interesting kind of variation by

00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:49.900 
interesting kind of variation by
applying<00:01:47.300> a<00:01:47.510> force<00:01:48.310> overtime<00:01:49.310> for<00:01:49.490> those<00:01:49.670> so

00:01:49.900 --> 00:01:49.910 
applying a force overtime for those so

00:01:49.910 --> 00:01:53.200 
applying a force overtime for those so
let's<00:01:50.090> do<00:01:50.330> that<00:01:50.510> a<00:01:50.540> little<00:01:50.750> bit<00:01:51.640> just<00:01:52.640> a<00:01:52.790> simple

00:01:53.200 --> 00:01:53.210 
let's do that a little bit just a simple

00:01:53.210 --> 00:01:57.310 
let's do that a little bit just a simple
kind<00:01:53.570> of<00:01:54.940> force<00:01:55.940> that's<00:01:56.210> added<00:01:57.080> to<00:01:57.110> the

00:01:57.310 --> 00:01:57.320 
kind of force that's added to the

00:01:57.320 --> 00:01:58.630 
kind of force that's added to the
particle<00:01:57.680> at<00:01:57.770> the<00:01:57.890> very<00:01:58.040> beginning<00:01:58.400> of<00:01:58.460> its

00:01:58.630 --> 00:01:58.640 
particle at the very beginning of its

00:01:58.640 --> 00:02:00.940 
particle at the very beginning of its
lifetime<00:01:58.820> and<00:01:59.119> it<00:01:59.180> kind<00:01:59.360> of<00:01:59.390> dissipates<00:01:59.869> as<00:02:00.740> it

00:02:00.940 --> 00:02:00.950 
lifetime and it kind of dissipates as it

00:02:00.950 --> 00:02:02.440 
lifetime and it kind of dissipates as it
goes<00:02:01.070> on<00:02:01.220> just<00:02:01.520> so<00:02:01.640> that<00:02:01.670> they<00:02:01.910> kind<00:02:02.119> of<00:02:02.180> start

00:02:02.440 --> 00:02:02.450 
goes on just so that they kind of start

00:02:02.450 --> 00:02:04.630 
goes on just so that they kind of start
off<00:02:02.540> more<00:02:02.930> variable<00:02:03.440> and<00:02:03.680> then<00:02:04.130> they<00:02:04.250> kind<00:02:04.490> of

00:02:04.630 --> 00:02:04.640 
off more variable and then they kind of

00:02:04.640 --> 00:02:07.180 
off more variable and then they kind of
slowly<00:02:05.600> decrease<00:02:06.140> the<00:02:06.320> variability<00:02:06.710> as<00:02:07.009> that

00:02:07.180 --> 00:02:07.190 
slowly decrease the variability as that

00:02:07.190 --> 00:02:10.389 
slowly decrease the variability as that
time<00:02:07.369> goes<00:02:07.580> on<00:02:07.810> so<00:02:08.810> let's<00:02:08.959> change<00:02:09.320> since<00:02:10.280> you

00:02:10.389 --> 00:02:10.399 
time goes on so let's change since you

00:02:10.399 --> 00:02:11.500 
time goes on so let's change since you
can't<00:02:10.580> really<00:02:10.700> see<00:02:10.910> it<00:02:11.000> right<00:02:11.030> now<00:02:11.180> let's

00:02:11.500 --> 00:02:11.510 
can't really see it right now let's

00:02:11.510 --> 00:02:14.050 
can't really see it right now let's
changed<00:02:11.959> the<00:02:12.280> maximum<00:02:13.280> and<00:02:13.400> minimum<00:02:13.430> limits

00:02:14.050 --> 00:02:14.060 
changed the maximum and minimum limits

00:02:14.060 --> 00:02:17.020 
changed the maximum and minimum limits
of<00:02:14.360> that<00:02:14.690> particle<00:02:15.140> and<00:02:16.100> then<00:02:16.310> paste<00:02:16.670> those

00:02:17.020 --> 00:02:17.030 
of that particle and then paste those

00:02:17.030 --> 00:02:20.440 
of that particle and then paste those
graphs<00:02:17.420> over<00:02:17.770> to<00:02:18.770> that<00:02:19.160> the<00:02:19.970> next<00:02:20.209> thing<00:02:20.360> we

00:02:20.440 --> 00:02:20.450 
graphs over to that the next thing we

00:02:20.450 --> 00:02:22.120 
graphs over to that the next thing we
want<00:02:20.630> to<00:02:20.660> do<00:02:20.780> is<00:02:20.900> color<00:02:21.140> over<00:02:21.380> lifetime<00:02:21.560> let's

00:02:22.120 --> 00:02:22.130 
want to do is color over lifetime let's

00:02:22.130 --> 00:02:24.460 
want to do is color over lifetime let's
give<00:02:22.430> our<00:02:23.209> particle<00:02:23.810> a<00:02:23.840> little<00:02:24.050> kind<00:02:24.260> of<00:02:24.350> a

00:02:24.460 --> 00:02:24.470 
give our particle a little kind of a

00:02:24.470 --> 00:02:27.280 
give our particle a little kind of a
yellowish<00:02:24.920> yellowish<00:02:25.820> color<00:02:26.090> a<00:02:26.390> little

00:02:27.280 --> 00:02:27.290 
yellowish yellowish color a little

00:02:27.290 --> 00:02:30.580 
yellowish yellowish color a little
bright<00:02:28.209> and<00:02:29.209> then<00:02:29.510> instead<00:02:30.050> of<00:02:30.170> having<00:02:30.380> it

00:02:30.580 --> 00:02:30.590 
bright and then instead of having it

00:02:30.590 --> 00:02:33.070 
bright and then instead of having it
kinda<00:02:30.770> just<00:02:30.830> pop<00:02:31.070> into<00:02:31.310> existence<00:02:31.750> we<00:02:32.750> want<00:02:32.989> it

00:02:33.070 --> 00:02:33.080 
kinda just pop into existence we want it

00:02:33.080 --> 00:02:36.370 
kinda just pop into existence we want it
to<00:02:33.200> kind<00:02:33.350> of<00:02:33.500> fade<00:02:33.739> in<00:02:34.010> a<00:02:34.040> little<00:02:34.640> bit<00:02:35.170> so<00:02:36.170> we

00:02:36.370 --> 00:02:36.380 
to kind of fade in a little bit so we

00:02:36.380 --> 00:02:38.710 
to kind of fade in a little bit so we
can<00:02:36.410> do<00:02:36.680> that<00:02:36.860> we<00:02:37.340> do<00:02:37.489> want<00:02:37.730> it<00:02:37.850> to<00:02:38.090> not<00:02:38.450> fade

00:02:38.710 --> 00:02:38.720 
can do that we do want it to not fade

00:02:38.720 --> 00:02:40.540 
can do that we do want it to not fade
out<00:02:38.870> because<00:02:39.260> the<00:02:39.620> explosion<00:02:40.130> effect<00:02:40.400> that

00:02:40.540 --> 00:02:40.550 
out because the explosion effect that

00:02:40.550 --> 00:02:42.430 
out because the explosion effect that
we're<00:02:40.670> going<00:02:41.239> to<00:02:41.300> do<00:02:41.450> later<00:02:41.660> is<00:02:41.930> going<00:02:41.989> to<00:02:42.230> kind

00:02:42.430 --> 00:02:42.440 
we're going to do later is going to kind

00:02:42.440 --> 00:02:45.490 
we're going to do later is going to kind
of<00:02:42.560> hide<00:02:42.769> that<00:02:42.950> a<00:02:43.010> little<00:02:43.340> bit<00:02:43.489> so<00:02:44.320> with<00:02:45.320> that

00:02:45.490 --> 00:02:45.500 
of hide that a little bit so with that

00:02:45.500 --> 00:02:48.130 
of hide that a little bit so with that
said<00:02:45.890> let's<00:02:46.310> move<00:02:46.430> on<00:02:46.850> to<00:02:47.660> adding<00:02:47.720> a<00:02:47.959> sub

00:02:48.130 --> 00:02:48.140 
said let's move on to adding a sub

00:02:48.140 --> 00:02:49.660 
said let's move on to adding a sub
emitter<00:02:48.410> I'm<00:02:48.650> going<00:02:48.830> to<00:02:48.890> explain<00:02:49.250> how<00:02:49.310> to<00:02:49.549> use

00:02:49.660 --> 00:02:49.670 
emitter I'm going to explain how to use

00:02:49.670 --> 00:02:52.090 
emitter I'm going to explain how to use
these<00:02:49.970> in<00:02:50.150> a<00:02:50.209> later<00:02:50.420> tutorial<00:02:50.480> video<00:02:51.140> but

00:02:52.090 --> 00:02:52.100 
these in a later tutorial video but

00:02:52.100 --> 00:02:53.979 
these in a later tutorial video but
we're<00:02:52.250> going<00:02:52.340> to<00:02:52.400> be<00:02:52.519> using<00:02:52.730> them<00:02:53.090> for<00:02:53.840> this

00:02:53.979 --> 00:02:53.989 
we're going to be using them for this

00:02:53.989 --> 00:02:55.630 
we're going to be using them for this
particle<00:02:54.470> system<00:02:54.500> so<00:02:55.190> if<00:02:55.250> you<00:02:55.340> know<00:02:55.430> how<00:02:55.549> to

00:02:55.630 --> 00:02:55.640 
particle system so if you know how to

00:02:55.640 --> 00:02:57.460 
particle system so if you know how to
use<00:02:55.760> them<00:02:55.970> cool<00:02:56.180> if<00:02:56.420> not<00:02:56.450> no<00:02:56.900> worries<00:02:56.930> you'll

00:02:57.460 --> 00:02:57.470 
use them cool if not no worries you'll

00:02:57.470 --> 00:02:58.810 
use them cool if not no worries you'll
kind<00:02:57.709> of<00:02:57.769> get<00:02:57.890> a<00:02:57.950> sense<00:02:58.220> of<00:02:58.310> how<00:02:58.489> they<00:02:58.640> work

00:02:58.810 --> 00:02:58.820 
kind of get a sense of how they work

00:02:58.820 --> 00:03:02.069 
kind of get a sense of how they work
here<00:02:59.720> so<00:02:59.930> let's<00:03:00.079> go<00:03:00.230> ahead<00:03:00.380> and<00:03:00.769> add<00:03:00.920> a<00:03:00.950> birth<00:03:01.519> a

00:03:02.069 --> 00:03:02.079 
here so let's go ahead and add a birth a

00:03:02.079 --> 00:03:05.259 
here so let's go ahead and add a birth a
particle<00:03:03.079> system<00:03:03.200> or<00:03:03.890> a<00:03:03.950> sub<00:03:04.340> emitter<00:03:04.579> added

00:03:05.259 --> 00:03:05.269 
particle system or a sub emitter added

00:03:05.269 --> 00:03:07.600 
particle system or a sub emitter added
on<00:03:05.480> the<00:03:05.690> birth<00:03:05.840> of<00:03:05.959> each<00:03:06.140> particle<00:03:06.470> and<00:03:06.829> now<00:03:07.549> we

00:03:07.600 --> 00:03:07.610 
on the birth of each particle and now we

00:03:07.610 --> 00:03:09.370 
on the birth of each particle and now we
actually<00:03:08.090> have<00:03:08.329> a<00:03:08.450> hierarchy<00:03:08.959> now<00:03:09.110> because

00:03:09.370 --> 00:03:09.380 
actually have a hierarchy now because

00:03:09.380 --> 00:03:10.900 
actually have a hierarchy now because
the<00:03:09.500> set<00:03:09.680> of<00:03:09.769> sublimator<00:03:10.310> was<00:03:10.489> adequate

00:03:10.900 --> 00:03:10.910 
the set of sublimator was adequate

00:03:10.910 --> 00:03:12.990 
the set of sublimator was adequate
automatically<00:03:11.690> add<00:03:11.810> as<00:03:11.959> a<00:03:11.989> child<00:03:12.500> to<00:03:12.739> our

00:03:12.990 --> 00:03:13.000 
automatically add as a child to our

00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:15.759 
automatically add as a child to our
current<00:03:14.000> emitter<00:03:14.540> so<00:03:14.900> let's<00:03:15.170> change<00:03:15.470> the

00:03:15.759 --> 00:03:15.769 
current emitter so let's change the

00:03:15.769 --> 00:03:17.530 
current emitter so let's change the
names<00:03:15.980> of<00:03:16.160> these<00:03:16.280> so<00:03:16.820> we<00:03:16.940> don't<00:03:17.120> forget<00:03:17.239> that

00:03:17.530 --> 00:03:17.540 
names of these so we don't forget that

00:03:17.540 --> 00:03:20.500 
names of these so we don't forget that
this<00:03:17.720> is<00:03:17.780> our<00:03:18.200> main<00:03:18.500> and<00:03:18.860> that<00:03:19.610> this<00:03:19.820> is<00:03:20.120> the

00:03:20.500 --> 00:03:20.510 
this is our main and that this is the

00:03:20.510 --> 00:03:22.520 
this is our main and that this is the
tray<00:03:20.870> limiter<00:03:21.170> that<00:03:21.380> we<00:03:21.470> have

00:03:22.520 --> 00:03:22.530 
tray limiter that we have

00:03:24.740 --> 00:03:24.750 
so back to the trail emitter we want to

00:03:24.750 --> 00:03:26.420 
so back to the trail emitter we want to

00:03:29.840 --> 00:03:29.850 
parent lifetimes fine speed is fine

00:03:29.850 --> 00:03:31.880 
parent lifetimes fine speed is fine
sighs<00:03:30.360> we<00:03:30.810> probably<00:03:31.200> want<00:03:31.380> it<00:03:31.410> to<00:03:31.530> be<00:03:31.650> a<00:03:31.680> little

00:03:31.880 --> 00:03:31.890 
sighs we probably want it to be a little

00:03:31.890 --> 00:03:35.090 
sighs we probably want it to be a little
bit<00:03:31.980> smaller<00:03:32.280> than<00:03:32.970> the<00:03:33.120> main<00:03:33.270> just<00:03:33.980> we're<00:03:34.980> not

00:03:35.090 --> 00:03:35.100 
bit smaller than the main just we're not

00:03:35.100 --> 00:03:38.300 
bit smaller than the main just we're not
that<00:03:35.310> small<00:03:36.140> just<00:03:37.140> so<00:03:37.230> we<00:03:37.440> can<00:03:37.620> kind<00:03:37.830> of<00:03:37.950> tell

00:03:38.300 --> 00:03:38.310 
that small just so we can kind of tell

00:03:38.310 --> 00:03:40.520 
that small just so we can kind of tell
the<00:03:38.400> difference<00:03:38.670> between<00:03:38.820> the<00:03:39.090> two<00:03:39.530> let's

00:03:40.520 --> 00:03:40.530 
the difference between the two let's

00:03:40.530 --> 00:03:42.560 
the difference between the two let's
give<00:03:40.980> it<00:03:41.010> a<00:03:41.190> little<00:03:41.340> bit<00:03:41.550> of<00:03:41.640> gravity<00:03:42.060> so<00:03:42.090> kind

00:03:42.560 --> 00:03:42.570 
give it a little bit of gravity so kind

00:03:42.570 --> 00:03:46.699 
give it a little bit of gravity so kind
of<00:03:42.660> a<00:03:42.870> little<00:03:43.020> bit<00:03:43.260> more<00:03:43.440> realistic<00:03:45.709> change

00:03:46.699 --> 00:03:46.709 
of a little bit more realistic change

00:03:46.709 --> 00:03:48.500 
of a little bit more realistic change
the<00:03:46.920> emission<00:03:47.160> because<00:03:47.850> right<00:03:48.240> now<00:03:48.330> it's

00:03:48.500 --> 00:03:48.510 
the emission because right now it's

00:03:48.510 --> 00:03:51.830 
the emission because right now it's

and<00:03:53.670> our<00:03:53.760> main<00:03:53.910> system<00:03:54.270> so<00:03:54.450> we<00:03:54.510> don't<00:03:54.690> need

00:03:54.860 --> 00:03:54.870 
and our main system so we don't need

00:03:54.870 --> 00:03:56.510 
and our main system so we don't need
that<00:03:55.110> many<00:03:55.200> particles<00:03:55.739> let's<00:03:56.010> just<00:03:56.190> kind<00:03:56.400> of

00:03:56.510 --> 00:03:56.520 
that many particles let's just kind of

00:03:56.520 --> 00:04:00.380 
that many particles let's just kind of
reduce<00:03:57.390> that<00:03:57.860> a<00:03:58.860> lot<00:03:59.760> of<00:03:59.850> these<00:03:59.970> numbers<00:04:00.150> you

00:04:00.380 --> 00:04:00.390 
reduce that a lot of these numbers you

00:04:00.390 --> 00:04:02.000 
reduce that a lot of these numbers you
can<00:04:00.510> kind<00:04:00.660> of<00:04:00.690> just<00:04:00.870> play<00:04:01.020> with<00:04:01.200> to<00:04:01.470> see<00:04:01.680> what

00:04:02.000 --> 00:04:02.010 
can kind of just play with to see what

00:04:02.010 --> 00:04:03.560 
can kind of just play with to see what
fits<00:04:02.280> you<00:04:02.430> best<00:04:02.640> but<00:04:02.880> I'm<00:04:02.970> just<00:04:03.120> doing<00:04:03.420> this

00:04:03.560 --> 00:04:03.570 
fits you best but I'm just doing this

00:04:03.570 --> 00:04:05.270 
fits you best but I'm just doing this
kind<00:04:04.260> of<00:04:04.320> quickly<00:04:04.560> in<00:04:04.739> order<00:04:04.950> to<00:04:05.070> save<00:04:05.250> time

00:04:05.270 --> 00:04:05.280 
kind of quickly in order to save time

00:04:05.280 --> 00:04:11.390 
kind of quickly in order to save time
the<00:04:06.050> shape<00:04:07.050> is<00:04:07.410> perfectly<00:04:08.190> fine<00:04:09.200> we<00:04:10.200> could<00:04:11.190> add

00:04:11.390 --> 00:04:11.400 
the shape is perfectly fine we could add

00:04:11.400 --> 00:04:12.979 
the shape is perfectly fine we could add
a<00:04:11.430> little<00:04:11.730> bit<00:04:11.880> of<00:04:12.000> variability<00:04:12.420> to<00:04:12.750> kind<00:04:12.930> of

00:04:12.979 --> 00:04:12.989 
a little bit of variability to kind of

00:04:12.989 --> 00:04:15.470 
a little bit of variability to kind of
match<00:04:13.230> the<00:04:13.260> particles<00:04:14.100> that<00:04:14.400> we<00:04:14.790> have<00:04:15.030> earlier

00:04:15.470 --> 00:04:15.480 
match the particles that we have earlier

00:04:15.480 --> 00:04:17.569 
match the particles that we have earlier
but<00:04:16.440> instead<00:04:16.709> of<00:04:16.769> doing<00:04:16.950> a<00:04:17.130> force<00:04:17.370> over

00:04:17.569 --> 00:04:17.579 
but instead of doing a force over

00:04:17.579 --> 00:04:18.800 
but instead of doing a force over
lifetime<00:04:17.760> let's<00:04:18.060> do<00:04:18.150> a<00:04:18.209> velocity<00:04:18.660> over

00:04:18.800 --> 00:04:18.810 
lifetime let's do a velocity over

00:04:18.810 --> 00:04:20.300 
lifetime let's do a velocity over
lifetime<00:04:19.019> for<00:04:19.410> a<00:04:19.470> bit<00:04:19.620> more<00:04:19.769> immediate

00:04:20.300 --> 00:04:20.310 
lifetime for a bit more immediate

00:04:20.310 --> 00:04:23.659 
lifetime for a bit more immediate
results<00:04:20.940> and<00:04:21.380> kind<00:04:22.380> of<00:04:22.470> just<00:04:22.680> do<00:04:22.860> this<00:04:23.100> random

00:04:23.659 --> 00:04:23.669 
results and kind of just do this random

00:04:23.669 --> 00:04:26.450 
results and kind of just do this random
kind<00:04:24.630> of<00:04:24.750> in<00:04:24.930> and<00:04:25.110> out<00:04:25.200> of<00:04:25.470> positive<00:04:26.040> velocity

00:04:26.450 --> 00:04:26.460 
kind of in and out of positive velocity

00:04:26.460 --> 00:04:27.890 
kind of in and out of positive velocity
so<00:04:26.610> they<00:04:26.729> kind<00:04:26.910> of<00:04:26.970> go<00:04:27.180> back<00:04:27.390> and<00:04:27.570> forth<00:04:27.810> a

00:04:27.890 --> 00:04:27.900 
so they kind of go back and forth a

00:04:27.900 --> 00:04:30.080 
so they kind of go back and forth a
little<00:04:27.960> bit<00:04:28.110> following<00:04:28.530> the<00:04:28.650> particle<00:04:29.090> so

00:04:30.080 --> 00:04:30.090 
little bit following the particle so

00:04:30.090 --> 00:04:33.020 
little bit following the particle so
let's<00:04:30.270> change<00:04:30.540> the<00:04:31.160> maximum<00:04:32.160> minimum<00:04:32.729> so<00:04:32.910> it's

00:04:33.020 --> 00:04:33.030 
let's change the maximum minimum so it's

00:04:33.030 --> 00:04:34.969 
let's change the maximum minimum so it's
a<00:04:33.120> little<00:04:33.210> bit<00:04:33.419> more<00:04:33.570> noticeable<00:04:34.290> but<00:04:34.470> not<00:04:34.650> too

00:04:34.969 --> 00:04:34.979 
a little bit more noticeable but not too

00:04:34.979 --> 00:04:37.510 
a little bit more noticeable but not too
noticeable<00:04:35.160> that<00:04:35.700> it's<00:04:35.820> distracting<00:04:36.510> and

00:04:37.510 --> 00:04:37.520 
noticeable that it's distracting and

00:04:37.520 --> 00:04:40.820 
noticeable that it's distracting and
then<00:04:38.520> let's<00:04:38.880> go<00:04:39.090> over<00:04:39.120> to<00:04:39.930> the<00:04:40.140> color<00:04:40.380> over

00:04:40.820 --> 00:04:40.830 
then let's go over to the color over

00:04:40.830 --> 00:04:43.969 
then let's go over to the color over
lifetime<00:04:41.690> and<00:04:42.690> give<00:04:42.870> it<00:04:43.020> a<00:04:43.440> kind<00:04:43.860> of

00:04:43.969 --> 00:04:43.979 
lifetime and give it a kind of

00:04:43.979 --> 00:04:47.900 
lifetime and give it a kind of
interesting<00:04:44.669> fade-out<00:04:45.660> and<00:04:46.490> then<00:04:47.490> have<00:04:47.880> a

00:04:47.900 --> 00:04:47.910 
interesting fade-out and then have a

00:04:47.910 --> 00:04:49.880 
interesting fade-out and then have a
yellow<00:04:48.150> color<00:04:48.479> that<00:04:48.570> kind<00:04:48.900> of<00:04:49.020> matches<00:04:49.620> what

00:04:49.880 --> 00:04:49.890 
yellow color that kind of matches what

00:04:49.890 --> 00:04:54.380 
yellow color that kind of matches what
we<00:04:50.160> had<00:04:50.460> before<00:04:50.990> in<00:04:51.990> our<00:04:52.110> other<00:04:52.290> system

00:04:54.380 --> 00:04:54.390 
we had before in our other system

00:04:54.390 --> 00:04:56.970 
we had before in our other system
and<00:04:55.390> then<00:04:55.630> let's<00:04:55.840> do<00:04:56.050> a<00:04:56.080> size<00:04:56.440> over<00:04:56.770> lifetime

00:04:56.970 --> 00:04:56.980 
and then let's do a size over lifetime

00:04:56.980 --> 00:04:59.070 
and then let's do a size over lifetime
to<00:04:57.430> make<00:04:57.520> them<00:04:57.700> kind<00:04:57.970> of<00:04:58.180> shrink<00:04:58.870> out<00:04:58.990> of

00:04:59.070 --> 00:04:59.080 
to make them kind of shrink out of

00:04:59.080 --> 00:05:00.630 
to make them kind of shrink out of
existence<00:04:59.560> to<00:04:59.740> add<00:04:59.860> to<00:05:00.040> our<00:05:00.100> little<00:05:00.310> fade

00:05:00.630 --> 00:05:00.640 
existence to add to our little fade

00:05:00.640 --> 00:05:04.530 
existence to add to our little fade
effect<00:05:02.070> it's<00:05:03.070> easy<00:05:03.280> enough<00:05:03.460> so<00:05:03.970> that's<00:05:04.360> good

00:05:04.530 --> 00:05:04.540 
effect it's easy enough so that's good

00:05:04.540 --> 00:05:07.230 
effect it's easy enough so that's good
enough<00:05:04.660> for<00:05:04.900> our<00:05:04.960> trail<00:05:05.290> for<00:05:05.560> now<00:05:05.940> let's<00:05:06.940> move

00:05:07.230 --> 00:05:07.240 
enough for our trail for now let's move

00:05:07.240 --> 00:05:10.650 
enough for our trail for now let's move
on<00:05:07.570> to<00:05:08.110> back<00:05:08.740> to<00:05:08.920> our<00:05:09.040> main<00:05:09.310> and<00:05:09.610> then<00:05:10.210> add<00:05:10.390> the

00:05:10.650 --> 00:05:10.660 
on to back to our main and then add the

00:05:10.660 --> 00:05:12.480 
on to back to our main and then add the
little<00:05:10.870> explosion<00:05:11.470> effect<00:05:11.740> by<00:05:11.920> adding<00:05:11.950> a

00:05:12.480 --> 00:05:12.490 
little explosion effect by adding a

00:05:12.490 --> 00:05:15.030 
little explosion effect by adding a
death<00:05:12.820> sublimator<00:05:13.330> so<00:05:14.140> let's<00:05:14.410> change<00:05:14.710> this

00:05:15.030 --> 00:05:15.040 
death sublimator so let's change this

00:05:15.040 --> 00:05:19.400 
death sublimator so let's change this
one's<00:05:15.340> name<00:05:16.030> to<00:05:16.420> explosion

00:05:19.400 --> 00:05:19.410 

00:05:19.410 --> 00:05:22.290 

match<00:05:20.410> the<00:05:20.680> duration<00:05:20.890> to<00:05:21.400> our<00:05:21.520> other<00:05:21.700> particle

00:05:22.290 --> 00:05:22.300 
match the duration to our other particle

00:05:22.300 --> 00:05:24.360 
match the duration to our other particle
have<00:05:22.690> a<00:05:22.720> lifetime<00:05:23.260> be<00:05:23.590> way<00:05:23.860> shorter<00:05:24.250> because

00:05:24.360 --> 00:05:24.370 
have a lifetime be way shorter because

00:05:24.370 --> 00:05:26.940 
have a lifetime be way shorter because
explosions<00:05:25.090> don't<00:05:25.870> last<00:05:26.050> that<00:05:26.230> long<00:05:26.410> and

00:05:26.940 --> 00:05:26.950 
explosions don't last that long and

00:05:26.950 --> 00:05:29.940 
explosions don't last that long and
change<00:05:27.430> the<00:05:27.640> speed<00:05:27.940> because<00:05:28.480> explosions<00:05:29.110> kind

00:05:29.940 --> 00:05:29.950 
change the speed because explosions kind

00:05:29.950 --> 00:05:31.790 
change the speed because explosions kind
of<00:05:30.040> have<00:05:30.280> a<00:05:30.370> very<00:05:30.580> dramatic<00:05:30.730> speed<00:05:31.270> the<00:05:31.600> size

00:05:31.790 --> 00:05:31.800 
of have a very dramatic speed the size

00:05:31.800 --> 00:05:34.410 
of have a very dramatic speed the size
could<00:05:32.800> have<00:05:33.040> it<00:05:33.160> a<00:05:33.310> little<00:05:33.610> bit<00:05:33.760> smaller<00:05:34.060> just

00:05:34.410 --> 00:05:34.420 
could have it a little bit smaller just

00:05:34.420 --> 00:05:36.260 
could have it a little bit smaller just
so<00:05:34.510> we<00:05:34.690> can<00:05:34.840> see<00:05:35.020> everything<00:05:35.260> that's<00:05:35.470> going<00:05:35.590> on

00:05:36.260 --> 00:05:36.270 
so we can see everything that's going on

00:05:36.270 --> 00:05:39.270 
so we can see everything that's going on
give<00:05:37.270> it<00:05:37.300> a<00:05:37.480> bit<00:05:37.750> of<00:05:37.780> gravity<00:05:38.380> just<00:05:38.980> so<00:05:39.100> it's<00:05:39.220> a

00:05:39.270 --> 00:05:39.280 
give it a bit of gravity just so it's a

00:05:39.280 --> 00:05:41.940 
give it a bit of gravity just so it's a
bit<00:05:39.430> more<00:05:39.460> realistic<00:05:40.210> so<00:05:40.600> let's<00:05:40.780> make<00:05:41.020> that<00:05:41.230> a

00:05:41.940 --> 00:05:41.950 
bit more realistic so let's make that a

00:05:41.950 --> 00:05:47.070 
bit more realistic so let's make that a
lot<00:05:42.580> of<00:05:42.700> gravity<00:05:43.150> and<00:05:43.360> then<00:05:44.730> moving<00:05:45.730> on<00:05:46.080> we

00:05:47.070 --> 00:05:47.080 
lot of gravity and then moving on we

00:05:47.080 --> 00:05:49.170 
lot of gravity and then moving on we
want<00:05:47.260> to<00:05:47.320> change<00:05:47.620> we<00:05:47.950> don't<00:05:48.040> need<00:05:48.220> 30

00:05:49.170 --> 00:05:49.180 
want to change we don't need 30

00:05:49.180 --> 00:05:51.210 
want to change we don't need 30
particles<00:05:49.720> per<00:05:50.140> particle<00:05:50.830> of<00:05:50.919> our<00:05:51.070> main

00:05:51.210 --> 00:05:51.220 
particles per particle of our main

00:05:51.220 --> 00:05:52.950 
particles per particle of our main
system<00:05:51.669> because<00:05:51.910> that's<00:05:52.090> a<00:05:52.419> little<00:05:52.720> way<00:05:52.900> too

00:05:52.950 --> 00:05:52.960 
system because that's a little way too

00:05:52.960 --> 00:05:56.640 
system because that's a little way too
many<00:05:53.490> even<00:05:54.490> 20<00:05:55.090> is<00:05:55.180> a<00:05:55.300> bit<00:05:55.480> much<00:05:55.630> but<00:05:56.020> I'm<00:05:56.410> just

00:05:56.640 --> 00:05:56.650 
many even 20 is a bit much but I'm just

00:05:56.650 --> 00:05:58.820 
many even 20 is a bit much but I'm just
doing<00:05:56.800> this<00:05:57.040> so<00:05:57.100> you<00:05:57.250> can<00:05:57.430> kind<00:05:57.640> of<00:05:57.700> see<00:05:57.970> the

00:05:58.820 --> 00:05:58.830 
doing this so you can kind of see the

00:05:58.830 --> 00:06:01.290 
doing this so you can kind of see the
particles<00:05:59.830> in<00:05:59.950> the<00:05:59.980> video<00:06:00.280> a<00:06:00.520> little<00:06:00.910> bit<00:06:01.090> more

00:06:01.290 --> 00:06:01.300 
particles in the video a little bit more

00:06:01.300 --> 00:06:03.270 
particles in the video a little bit more
the<00:06:01.750> shape<00:06:02.169> is<00:06:02.350> perfectly<00:06:02.770> fine<00:06:03.040> it's

00:06:03.270 --> 00:06:03.280 
the shape is perfectly fine it's

00:06:03.280 --> 00:06:04.800 
the shape is perfectly fine it's
matching<00:06:03.490> kind<00:06:04.090> of<00:06:04.180> what<00:06:04.330> our<00:06:04.510> initial

00:06:04.800 --> 00:06:04.810 
matching kind of what our initial

00:06:04.810 --> 00:06:07.050 
matching kind of what our initial
particle<00:06:05.440> looks<00:06:05.680> like<00:06:05.919> so<00:06:06.550> that's<00:06:06.700> kind<00:06:06.940> of

00:06:07.050 --> 00:06:07.060 
particle looks like so that's kind of

00:06:07.060 --> 00:06:09.360 
particle looks like so that's kind of
what<00:06:07.240> we<00:06:07.360> want<00:06:07.540> it<00:06:07.630> to<00:06:07.780> have<00:06:08.200> we<00:06:08.680> want<00:06:08.919> it<00:06:09.010> to<00:06:09.160> so

00:06:09.360 --> 00:06:09.370 
what we want it to have we want it to so

00:06:09.370 --> 00:06:11.370 
what we want it to have we want it to so
that<00:06:09.550> it<00:06:10.030> kind<00:06:10.240> of<00:06:10.300> matches<00:06:10.510> that<00:06:10.810> ball<00:06:11.020> so<00:06:11.320> it

00:06:11.370 --> 00:06:11.380 
that it kind of matches that ball so it

00:06:11.380 --> 00:06:12.960 
that it kind of matches that ball so it
explodes<00:06:11.770> out<00:06:11.919> from<00:06:12.160> the<00:06:12.280> ball<00:06:12.430> or<00:06:12.610> at<00:06:12.760> least

00:06:12.960 --> 00:06:12.970 
explodes out from the ball or at least

00:06:12.970 --> 00:06:14.460 
explodes out from the ball or at least
looks<00:06:13.270> like<00:06:13.419> it's<00:06:13.570> exploding<00:06:13.900> out<00:06:14.169> from<00:06:14.350> the

00:06:14.460 --> 00:06:14.470 
looks like it's exploding out from the

00:06:14.470 --> 00:06:20.490 
looks like it's exploding out from the
ball<00:06:16.560> moving<00:06:17.560> on<00:06:17.830> we<00:06:18.370> can<00:06:18.610> do<00:06:18.880> make<00:06:19.570> it<00:06:19.720> kind<00:06:20.440> of

00:06:20.490 --> 00:06:20.500 
ball moving on we can do make it kind of

00:06:20.500 --> 00:06:24.090 
ball moving on we can do make it kind of
smaller<00:06:20.860> over<00:06:21.340> time<00:06:21.990> like<00:06:22.990> our<00:06:23.140> other<00:06:23.380> trail

00:06:24.090 --> 00:06:24.100 
smaller over time like our other trail

00:06:24.100 --> 00:06:25.920 
smaller over time like our other trail
particles<00:06:24.669> and<00:06:24.940> that'll<00:06:25.120> give<00:06:25.240> the<00:06:25.390> explosion

00:06:25.920 --> 00:06:25.930 
particles and that'll give the explosion

00:06:25.930 --> 00:06:27.960 
particles and that'll give the explosion
a<00:06:25.990> little<00:06:26.229> bit<00:06:26.350> more<00:06:26.590> interesting<00:06:27.310> kind<00:06:27.910> of

00:06:27.960 --> 00:06:27.970 
a little bit more interesting kind of

00:06:27.970 --> 00:06:31.140 
a little bit more interesting kind of
variability<00:06:29.070> then<00:06:30.070> let's<00:06:30.280> change<00:06:30.550> the<00:06:30.850> color

00:06:31.140 --> 00:06:31.150 
variability then let's change the color

00:06:31.150 --> 00:06:33.270 
variability then let's change the color
actually<00:06:31.540> let's<00:06:32.080> have<00:06:32.260> two<00:06:32.650> different<00:06:32.830> colors

00:06:33.270 --> 00:06:33.280 
actually let's have two different colors

00:06:33.280 --> 00:06:34.620 
actually let's have two different colors
to<00:06:33.460> make<00:06:33.580> it<00:06:33.700> a<00:06:33.760> little<00:06:33.850> bit<00:06:34.090> more<00:06:34.240> visually

00:06:34.620 --> 00:06:34.630 
to make it a little bit more visually

00:06:34.630 --> 00:06:37.710 
to make it a little bit more visually
interesting<00:06:35.520> so<00:06:36.520> the<00:06:36.700> first<00:06:36.940> one<00:06:37.120> just<00:06:37.360> be<00:06:37.510> a

00:06:37.710 --> 00:06:37.720 
interesting so the first one just be a

00:06:37.720 --> 00:06:39.630 
interesting so the first one just be a
blueish

00:06:39.630 --> 00:06:39.640 
blueish

00:06:39.640 --> 00:06:42.040 
blueish
and<00:06:40.640> then<00:06:40.730> we<00:06:40.820> can<00:06:40.970> have<00:06:41.120> that<00:06:41.420> one<00:06:41.570> fade<00:06:41.870> out

00:06:42.040 --> 00:06:42.050 
and then we can have that one fade out

00:06:42.050 --> 00:06:43.720 
and then we can have that one fade out
over<00:06:42.320> time<00:06:42.800> but<00:06:43.010> we<00:06:43.070> don't<00:06:43.220> want<00:06:43.430> it<00:06:43.490> to<00:06:43.580> fade

00:06:43.720 --> 00:06:43.730 
over time but we don't want it to fade

00:06:43.730 --> 00:06:45.580 
over time but we don't want it to fade
out<00:06:43.760> too<00:06:44.060> quickly<00:06:44.390> so<00:06:44.570> let's<00:06:44.900> change<00:06:45.380> the

00:06:45.580 --> 00:06:45.590 
out too quickly so let's change the

00:06:45.590 --> 00:06:50.260 
out too quickly so let's change the
Alpha<00:06:46.030> kind<00:06:47.030> of<00:06:47.150> 1/3<00:06:47.540> or<00:06:48.490> 3/4<00:06:49.490> in<00:06:49.610> the<00:06:49.700> way<00:06:49.850> into

00:06:50.260 --> 00:06:50.270 
Alpha kind of 1/3 or 3/4 in the way into

00:06:50.270 --> 00:06:51.700 
Alpha kind of 1/3 or 3/4 in the way into
its<00:06:50.420> lifetime<00:06:50.630> so<00:06:51.020> we<00:06:51.080> can<00:06:51.200> kind<00:06:51.380> of<00:06:51.410> see<00:06:51.590> it<00:06:51.650> a

00:06:51.700 --> 00:06:51.710 
its lifetime so we can kind of see it a

00:06:51.710 --> 00:06:54.400 
its lifetime so we can kind of see it a
bit<00:06:51.740> better<00:06:51.860> and<00:06:52.730> copy<00:06:53.120> that<00:06:53.390> over<00:06:53.900> and<00:06:54.380> then

00:06:54.400 --> 00:06:54.410 
bit better and copy that over and then

00:06:54.410 --> 00:06:59.110 
bit better and copy that over and then
change<00:06:54.950> the<00:06:55.400> color<00:06:57.580> see<00:06:58.580> let's<00:06:58.940> have<00:06:59.090> a

00:06:59.110 --> 00:06:59.120 
change the color see let's have a

00:06:59.120 --> 00:07:01.960 
change the color see let's have a
yellowish<00:07:00.100> particle<00:07:01.100> to<00:07:01.190> match<00:07:01.370> kind<00:07:01.670> of<00:07:01.820> our

00:07:01.960 --> 00:07:01.970 
yellowish particle to match kind of our

00:07:01.970 --> 00:07:04.630 
yellowish particle to match kind of our
trail<00:07:02.240> emitters<00:07:02.660> and<00:07:03.280> well<00:07:04.280> there<00:07:04.520> you<00:07:04.610> have

00:07:04.630 --> 00:07:04.640 
trail emitters and well there you have

00:07:04.640 --> 00:07:07.360 
trail emitters and well there you have
it<00:07:05.000> a<00:07:05.030> simple<00:07:05.750> kind<00:07:06.020> of<00:07:06.230> particle<00:07:06.680> system<00:07:07.070> that

00:07:07.360 --> 00:07:07.370 
it a simple kind of particle system that

00:07:07.370 --> 00:07:10.210 
it a simple kind of particle system that
shows<00:07:08.300> the<00:07:08.510> basic<00:07:08.930> animation<00:07:09.500> for<00:07:09.740> fireworks

00:07:10.210 --> 00:07:10.220 
shows the basic animation for fireworks

00:07:10.220 --> 00:07:12.850 
shows the basic animation for fireworks
and<00:07:10.460> can<00:07:10.790> work<00:07:11.270> for<00:07:11.570> onto<00:07:12.170> a<00:07:12.230> game<00:07:12.470> or<00:07:12.680> a<00:07:12.710> video

00:07:12.850 --> 00:07:12.860 
and can work for onto a game or a video
