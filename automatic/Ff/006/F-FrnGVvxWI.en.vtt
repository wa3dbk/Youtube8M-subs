00:00:03.730 --> 00:00:06.240
 4 minutes 

00:00:16.740 --> 00:00:21.000
 This is 80g 

00:00:18.670 --> 00:00:21.000
 Went back 

00:00:21.970 --> 00:00:31.789
 You three sides are jigging type of Giant Killing 

00:00:26.869 --> 00:00:36.680
 It is not Jigging series that normal 1 iron bridge is not doubled 

00:00:31.789 --> 00:00:37.829
 Well Jigging series name Of course there is Spinning series Bait series 

00:00:36.680 --> 00:00:41.789
 But 

00:00:37.829 --> 00:00:47.280
 That from 2oz + up to 6 ounces class 

00:00:41.789 --> 00:00:52.170
 That Tteyuu place to become the most main in the coastal waters of the sound jigging that we line up 

00:00:47.280 --> 00:00:55.079
 The 3oz state class is probably the most convenient place for many people 

00:00:52.170 --> 00:00:57.820
 Though I think Well across it 

00:00:55.079 --> 00:01:02.320
 Probably domestic from 2 oz to 6 oz 

00:00:57.820 --> 00:01:02.930
 If it 's that jigging of put in most places from among them 

00:01:02.320 --> 00:01:07.830
 What 

00:01:02.930 --> 00:01:12.630
 I think it perfect Sagashidaseru It is the Tteyuu one 

00:01:07.830 --> 00:01:15.780
 Well, it is not adopted in the habit of the recent major craft well adopted 

00:01:12.630 --> 00:01:21.900
 What is that Cross Force Manufacturing Process ? 

00:01:15.780 --> 00:01:24.050
 Well on that x to something with a twist Toka at 4 wrapping the cat of carbon tape 

00:01:21.900 --> 00:01:29.040
 It is a strong formula 

00:01:24.050 --> 00:01:34.980
 It + That Econo + k series ride 

00:01:29.040 --> 00:01:36.120
 That I have engaged in, but this k series very thread Karamigashi hard to is that guide 

00:01:34.980 --> 00:01:39.300
 Jigging 

00:01:36.120 --> 00:01:44.370
 When I'm doing shaky, I also say that it is in Yoshimi and the handle 

00:01:39.300 --> 00:01:45.990
 Clinging to come But I I think that's one of the trouble that sort of is Well that song 

00:01:44.370 --> 00:01:49.950
 Reduced to 

00:01:45.990 --> 00:01:53.759
 It is a guide to the I mean this k series line dot 

00:01:49.950 --> 00:01:59.830
 Well, I'm about to prevent the loose locking around here 

00:01:53.759 --> 00:02:02.980
 This school little by little I will or with natto also this while I have that jigging 

00:01:59.830 --> 00:02:07.870
 I Do not say I grip it come loose that reel seat is 

00:02:02.980 --> 00:02:11.490
 I guess some of you have experienced it, but that's right there 

00:02:07.870 --> 00:02:11.490
 It is also prevention 

00:02:16.440 --> 00:02:26.959
 In the case of that jigging, it is still jealousy movement 

00:02:21.319 --> 00:02:29.200
 This slightly Kedomo I think not about the mind until absolutely I now in behavior that Shaku' 

00:02:26.959 --> 00:02:34.810
 It is said that the twist is twisted 

00:02:29.200 --> 00:02:38.890
 It's happening, it's very important to say that the case is kept as small as possible 

00:02:34.810 --> 00:02:45.910
 You can attach this action smoothly and sharply 

00:02:38.890 --> 00:02:49.220
 Also, however or the other best is to Kamigu is the Tteyuu that cross Force process is in such surface 

00:02:45.910 --> 00:02:54.920
 It is this kind of vertical rather than casting 

00:02:49.220 --> 00:02:56.150
 That the most appropriate in the sense Tteyuu to prevent example than twist to say Shakurutsu Lee 

00:02:54.920 --> 00:02:56.900
 that 

00:02:56.150 --> 00:03:03.670
 so 

00:02:56.900 --> 00:03:03.670
 I think it seems to have its essence in the next
