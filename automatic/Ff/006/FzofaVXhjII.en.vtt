but want to talk about the importance of

00:01:05.710 --> 00:01:08.609

being<00:01:05.979> an<00:01:06.250> adaptable<00:01:06.969> battlefield<00:01:07.780> ER<00:01:07.960> and<00:01:08.140> I

00:01:08.609 --> 00:01:08.619 
being an adaptable battlefield ER and I

00:01:08.619 --> 00:01:11.489 
being an adaptable battlefield ER and I
believe<00:01:08.979> it's<00:01:09.250> a<00:01:09.399> really<00:01:09.820> underrated<00:01:10.499> skill

00:01:11.489 --> 00:01:11.499 
believe it's a really underrated skill

00:01:11.499 --> 00:01:13.590 
believe it's a really underrated skill
if<00:01:11.740> you<00:01:11.859> like<00:01:12.039> and<00:01:12.310> a<00:01:12.729> lot<00:01:12.939> of<00:01:12.969> people<00:01:13.060> aren't

00:01:13.590 --> 00:01:13.600 
if you like and a lot of people aren't

00:01:13.600 --> 00:01:16.080 
if you like and a lot of people aren't
willing<00:01:13.719> to<00:01:13.899> adapt<00:01:14.350> they<00:01:14.770> take<00:01:15.159> this<00:01:15.579> line

00:01:16.080 --> 00:01:16.090 
willing to adapt they take this line

00:01:16.090 --> 00:01:17.219 
willing to adapt they take this line
that<00:01:16.509> they're<00:01:16.630> going<00:01:16.719> to<00:01:16.810> play<00:01:16.929> a<00:01:16.959> certain

00:01:17.219 --> 00:01:17.229 
that they're going to play a certain

00:01:17.229 --> 00:01:19.319 
that they're going to play a certain
class<00:01:17.979> and<00:01:18.369> they<00:01:18.429> play<00:01:18.700> it<00:01:18.850> for<00:01:19.090> the<00:01:19.179> whole

00:01:19.319 --> 00:01:19.329 
class and they play it for the whole

00:01:19.329 --> 00:01:21.749 
class and they play it for the whole
round<00:01:19.600> now<00:01:20.289> I<00:01:20.319> believe<00:01:20.619> that<00:01:21.249> that's<00:01:21.459> bad

00:01:21.749 --> 00:01:21.759 
round now I believe that that's bad

00:01:21.759 --> 00:01:25.349 
round now I believe that that's bad
because<00:01:22.209> each<00:01:23.109> and<00:01:23.590> every<00:01:24.039> player<00:01:24.249> has<00:01:24.789> the

00:01:25.349 --> 00:01:25.359 
because each and every player has the

00:01:25.359 --> 00:01:27.959 
because each and every player has the
capability<00:01:26.259> of<00:01:26.409> turning<00:01:27.130> the<00:01:27.399> game<00:01:27.579> around

00:01:27.959 --> 00:01:27.969 
capability of turning the game around

00:01:27.969 --> 00:01:30.599 
capability of turning the game around
and<00:01:28.329> you<00:01:28.810> do<00:01:29.079> not<00:01:29.259> even<00:01:29.439> need<00:01:29.649> to<00:01:30.069> be<00:01:30.219> the<00:01:30.369> most

00:01:30.599 --> 00:01:30.609 
and you do not even need to be the most

00:01:30.609 --> 00:01:32.879 
and you do not even need to be the most

00:01:56.499 --> 00:01:58.109 
they now recover so as I say I came into
the<00:01:56.649> game<00:01:56.679> with<00:01:57.340> the<00:01:57.459> fall<00:01:57.700> of<00:01:57.849> playing

00:01:58.109 --> 00:01:58.119 
the game with the fall of playing

00:01:58.119 --> 00:02:00.629 
the game with the fall of playing
assault<00:01:58.509> I<00:01:58.659> very<00:01:59.229> quickly<00:01:59.529> realized<00:02:00.159> their

00:02:00.629 --> 00:02:00.639 
assault I very quickly realized their

00:02:00.639 --> 00:02:02.779 
assault I very quickly realized their
transport<00:02:01.240> choppers<00:02:01.630> their<00:02:01.869> air<00:02:02.020> superiority

00:02:02.779 --> 00:02:02.789 
transport choppers their air superiority

00:02:02.789 --> 00:02:06.569 
transport choppers their air superiority
needed<00:02:03.789> to<00:02:04.239> be<00:02:04.389> ended<00:02:04.899> so<00:02:05.469> I<00:02:05.499> changed<00:02:06.219> to

00:02:06.569 --> 00:02:06.579 
needed to be ended so I changed to

00:02:06.579 --> 00:02:08.820 
needed to be ended so I changed to
engineer<00:02:07.209> because<00:02:07.659> you<00:02:07.810> cannot<00:02:08.170> rely<00:02:08.530> on

00:02:08.820 --> 00:02:08.830 
engineer because you cannot rely on

00:02:08.830 --> 00:02:11.610 
engineer because you cannot rely on
other<00:02:09.099> people<00:02:09.160> to<00:02:09.520> do<00:02:09.759> so<00:02:10.090> you<00:02:10.630> see<00:02:10.660> here<00:02:11.140> the

other people to do so you see here the

00:02:11.620 --> 00:02:13.350 
other people to do so you see here the
other<00:02:11.770> team<00:02:12.069> have<00:02:12.489> bailed<00:02:12.880> out<00:02:13.120> of<00:02:13.209> their

other team have bailed out of their
chopper<00:02:13.690> I<00:02:13.780> decided<00:02:14.140> not<00:02:14.380> to<00:02:14.620> take<00:02:14.920> it<00:02:14.980> down

00:02:15.210 --> 00:02:15.220

00:02:59.780 --> 00:02:59.790 
number one don't give away the transport

00:02:59.790 --> 00:03:01.940 
number one don't give away the transport
ah<00:02:59.940> but<00:03:00.120> it<00:03:00.209> might<00:03:00.480> seem<00:03:00.840> like<00:03:00.870> a<00:03:01.109> free<00:03:01.470> taxi

00:03:01.940 --> 00:03:01.950

ah but it might seem like a free taxi
ride<00:03:02.220> to<00:03:02.519> the<00:03:02.909> other<00:03:03.030> end<00:03:03.209> of<00:03:03.389> the<00:03:03.450> map<00:03:03.629> but<00:03:04.019> if

00:03:04.099 --> 00:03:04.109 
ride to the other end of the map but if

00:03:04.109 --> 00:03:06.020 
ride to the other end of the map but if
you<00:03:04.170> insist<00:03:04.319> on<00:03:04.799> doing<00:03:05.040> it<00:03:05.310> then<00:03:05.700> at<00:03:05.819> least

00:03:06.020 --> 00:03:06.030 
you insist on doing it then at least

00:03:06.030 --> 00:03:08.300 
you insist on doing it then at least
make<00:03:06.329> sure<00:03:06.540> it<00:03:06.750> explodes<00:03:07.260> or<00:03:07.650> falls<00:03:07.950> to<00:03:08.189> its

00:03:08.300 --> 00:03:08.310 
make sure it explodes or falls to its

00:03:08.310 --> 00:03:10.220 
make sure it explodes or falls to its
death<00:03:08.609> so<00:03:08.970> it<00:03:09.090> respawns<00:03:09.569> for<00:03:09.870> your<00:03:09.959> team<00:03:10.200> to

00:03:10.220 --> 00:03:10.230 
death so it respawns for your team to

00:03:10.230 --> 00:03:13.789 
death so it respawns for your team to
use<00:03:10.650> number<00:03:11.639> to<00:03:11.909> realize<00:03:12.629> your<00:03:12.840> own<00:03:13.049> power<00:03:13.409> a

use number to realize your own power a
little<00:03:14.489> bit<00:03:14.670> of<00:03:14.700> four<00:03:15.030> and<00:03:15.239> you<00:03:15.420> can<00:03:15.629> really

00:03:15.830 --> 00:03:15.840 
little bit of four and you can really

00:03:15.840 --> 00:03:18.830 
little bit of four and you can really
change<00:03:16.170> the<00:03:16.470> game<00:03:16.680> I<00:03:16.980> want<00:03:17.519> to<00:03:17.579> show<00:03:17.790> you<00:03:17.849> how

00:03:21.949 --> 00:03:21.959 
close this game went in the end and who

00:03:21.959 --> 00:03:24.229 
close this game went in the end and who
knows<00:03:22.170> I'm<00:03:22.500> not<00:03:22.530> saying<00:03:22.950> it<00:03:23.069> did<00:03:23.250> but<00:03:23.489> maybe<00:03:23.819> my

00:03:24.229 --> 00:03:24.239 
knows I'm not saying it did but maybe my

00:03:24.239 --> 00:03:26.869 
knows I'm not saying it did but maybe my
attempts<00:03:24.840> at<00:03:25.099> taking<00:03:26.099> down<00:03:26.310> the<00:03:26.459> air<00:03:26.639> and

00:03:26.869 --> 00:03:26.879 
attempts at taking down the air and

00:03:26.879 --> 00:03:29.390 
attempts at taking down the air and
basically<00:03:27.810> taking<00:03:28.440> their<00:03:28.590> transport<00:03:29.099> chopper

00:03:29.390 --> 00:03:29.400 
basically taking their transport chopper

00:03:29.400 --> 00:03:31.280 
basically taking their transport chopper
when<00:03:29.579> they<00:03:29.760> abandoned<00:03:30.329> it<00:03:30.419> after<00:03:30.629> I<00:03:30.870> got<00:03:31.079> the

00:03:31.280 --> 00:03:31.290 
when they abandoned it after I got the

00:03:31.290 --> 00:03:33.379 
when they abandoned it after I got the
vehicle<00:03:31.650> mobility<00:03:32.190> hit<00:03:32.370> on<00:03:32.579> it<00:03:32.699> maybe<00:03:33.239> that

00:03:33.379 --> 00:03:33.389 
vehicle mobility hit on it maybe that

00:03:33.389 --> 00:03:35.659 
vehicle mobility hit on it maybe that
changed<00:03:33.989> the<00:03:34.319> game<00:03:34.500> because<00:03:34.949> there<00:03:35.099> wasn't<00:03:35.400> a

00:03:35.659 --> 00:03:35.669 
changed the game because there wasn't a

00:03:35.669 --> 00:03:38.479 
changed the game because there wasn't a
lot<00:03:35.819> of<00:03:35.879> tickets<00:03:36.180> in<00:03:36.510> the<00:03:36.629> end<00:03:36.750> anyway<00:03:37.650> I'll
