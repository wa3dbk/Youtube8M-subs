00:00:03.440 --> 00:00:10.610
 Well, the truth is that everything was quite 

00:00:06.529 --> 00:00:13.209
 fast because I knew the interest of the real 

00:00:10.610 --> 00:00:16.520
 oviedo through my representatives but 

00:00:13.209 --> 00:00:19.670
 at the beginning it was only an interest but 

00:00:16.520 --> 00:00:22.430
 then when they called me and carmelo 

00:00:19.670 --> 00:00:24.560
 The project commented the truth that 

00:00:22.430 --> 00:00:26.930
 I was very excited and I did not have it 

00:00:24.560 --> 00:00:29.000
 think about a couple of days then it closed 

00:00:26.930 --> 00:00:31.370
 everything and between all then we were 

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:33.800
 satisfied because it is a big challenge because 

00:00:31.370 --> 00:00:36.379
 why come a historic football club 

00:00:33.800 --> 00:00:39.140
 Spanish and the truth is that it's good that 

00:00:36.379 --> 00:00:41.569
 I would like to be an important part of this 

00:00:39.140 --> 00:00:43.699
 great project to climb the second 

00:00:41.569 --> 00:00:46.699
 and the truth is that I come with many 

00:00:43.699 --> 00:00:48.350
 you want a lot of enthusiasm and good because 

00:00:46.699 --> 00:00:50.929
 everyone was his real life or the second one 

00:00:48.350 --> 00:00:53.780
 which is a first division club what 

00:00:50.929 --> 00:00:56.179
 well here and all the second time 

00:00:53.780 --> 00:00:59.899
 It's costing him to leave here because 

00:00:56.179 --> 00:01:02.479
 because you can see it's not easy to get out here 

00:00:59.899 --> 00:01:05.030
 I do not think what good this year 

00:01:02.479 --> 00:01:06.409
 because of all the fans 

00:01:05.030 --> 00:01:08.569
 players then 

00:01:06.409 --> 00:01:10.670
 we have a good group for good 

00:01:08.569 --> 00:01:12.710
 to raise the team to second if it is 

00:01:10.670 --> 00:01:15.710
 normal is a big club has to have 

00:01:12.710 --> 00:01:18.409
 maximum requirement not and that group then what 

00:01:15.710 --> 00:01:21.109
 is the demand this year will be be 

00:01:18.409 --> 00:01:23.060
 first and go up second there is no there 

00:01:21.109 --> 00:01:24.469
 another objective then with several rural if 

00:01:23.060 --> 00:01:27.079
 I found him this year in a match 

00:01:24.469 --> 00:01:28.819
 of the row with the ucam murcia and 

00:01:27.079 --> 00:01:31.939
 He happened to be talking to me about this 

00:01:28.819 --> 00:01:35.179
 that it was a great club a nice city 

00:01:31.939 --> 00:01:37.729
 but that he was playing little I do not 

00:01:35.179 --> 00:01:39.549
 could comment anything but but well 

00:01:37.729 --> 00:01:41.959
 from seville to the people 

00:01:39.549 --> 00:01:44.569
 colleagues and friends who have been 

00:01:41.959 --> 00:01:46.099
 players have told me that this is not 

00:01:44.569 --> 00:01:48.200
 it tells you a great city is a club 

00:01:46.099 --> 00:01:49.489
 historical and that we can surely 

00:01:48.200 --> 00:01:50.689
 enjoy everything because I am a 

00:01:49.489 --> 00:01:54.230
 defensive midfielder 

00:01:50.689 --> 00:01:58.190
 defensive there playing during the defense 

00:01:54.230 --> 00:02:00.350
 and I like to be there in front of 

00:01:58.190 --> 00:02:02.900
 central defenses helping at the time of 

00:02:00.350 --> 00:02:04.670
 defend behind the interiors and 

00:02:02.900 --> 00:02:08.390
 the offensive midfielder I like it 

00:02:04.670 --> 00:02:10.790
 that will be there that is the broom player 

00:02:08.390 --> 00:02:13.250
 and good when it comes to having a balloon 

00:02:10.790 --> 00:02:15.670
 it's clear that I like to go out playing 

00:02:13.250 --> 00:02:17.800
 with the ball be part 

00:02:15.670 --> 00:02:20.380
 be an important part of the team to the 

00:02:17.800 --> 00:02:22.300
 Time to get out and playing good too me 

00:02:20.380 --> 00:02:23.540
 like to get to the area of ​​I have a beating 

00:02:22.300 --> 00:02:26.030
 and good 

00:02:23.540 --> 00:02:28.459
 a little yes with carmelo's had the 

00:02:26.030 --> 00:02:31.939
 option to speak and good was before 

00:02:28.459 --> 00:02:34.879
 that everything will close and we can comment 

00:02:31.939 --> 00:02:37.730
 the project the illusion that the 

00:02:34.879 --> 00:02:40.549
 people on their way second he trusted 

00:02:37.730 --> 00:02:42.980
 fully in me and I think it's something 

00:02:40.549 --> 00:02:45.920
 which is that they value a lot and I did not have 

00:02:42.980 --> 00:02:47.870
 that think a lot and therefore that 

00:02:45.920 --> 00:02:50.000
 confidence that they have deposited in me 

00:02:47.870 --> 00:02:52.609
 to show it inside the field and good 

00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:54.650
 I know them by name by getting into the 

00:02:52.609 --> 00:02:57.200
 web page I know it for photos but 

00:02:54.650 --> 00:02:59.180
 then I do not know them personally but 

00:02:57.200 --> 00:03:01.790
 well, while I will know them when 

00:02:59.180 --> 00:03:04.519
 start to start training the truth 

00:03:01.790 --> 00:03:07.220
 that would be a milestone when it comes here 

00:03:04.519 --> 00:03:08.550
 I've spent a lot of everything how big is 

00:03:07.220 --> 00:03:11.730
 stadium 

00:03:08.550 --> 00:03:13.440
 and it would be nice if not that 

00:03:11.730 --> 00:03:15.630
 they would chant the name but have the 

00:03:13.440 --> 00:03:18.180
 happy liking both with me in the 

00:03:15.630 --> 00:03:20.730
 team that would signal that everything is going 

00:03:18.180 --> 00:03:22.500
 well and as I told you before I think 

00:03:20.730 --> 00:03:25.080
 that the team hobby union is going to 

00:03:22.500 --> 00:03:27.600
 be important to for that to climb 

00:03:25.080 --> 00:03:30.660
 to second then it is clear that climb to 

00:03:27.600 --> 00:03:33.990
 second the primary objective is going to be 

00:03:30.660 --> 00:03:36.570
 stay first and then it can be clear 

00:03:33.990 --> 00:03:38.340
 that climb the second then personally 

00:03:36.570 --> 00:03:40.890
 I would like to play at maximum minutes and 

00:03:38.340 --> 00:03:42.360
 party for it I know I'm going to have to 

00:03:40.890 --> 00:03:45.030
 work hard and because I'm going to have 

00:03:42.360 --> 00:03:47.220
 a lot of competitiveness but good 

00:03:45.030 --> 00:03:48.750
 illusion that then since the minute one 

00:03:47.220 --> 00:03:50.490
 they are going to be important to us 

00:03:48.750 --> 00:03:52.970
 support us that the season is going to be 

00:03:50.490 --> 00:03:56.010
 long that we will be easy 

00:03:52.970 --> 00:03:58.170
 to be first and I think with the 

00:03:56.010 --> 00:04:00.660
 I support them because we are going to shoot for 

00:03:58.170 --> 00:04:03.030
 up to support us at all times 

00:04:00.660 --> 00:04:05.520
 we will show you 

00:04:03.030 --> 00:04:07.620
 within the field the desire that we have 

00:04:05.520 --> 00:04:09.330
 why the team is first and what 

00:04:07.620 --> 00:04:13.010
 good that together we all go together 

00:04:09.330 --> 00:04:13.010
 to get this out
