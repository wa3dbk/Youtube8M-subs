00:00:00.469 --> 00:00:03.590 

all<00:00:01.469> right<00:00:01.860> so<00:00:02.250> I<00:00:02.280> figured<00:00:03.090> I'd<00:00:03.210> do<00:00:03.360> another

00:00:03.590 --> 00:00:03.600 
all right so I figured I'd do another

00:00:03.600 --> 00:00:05.869 
all right so I figured I'd do another
interior<00:00:04.140> video<00:00:04.770> and<00:00:05.190> then<00:00:05.490> I'll<00:00:05.609> show<00:00:05.790> you

00:00:05.869 --> 00:00:05.879 
interior video and then I'll show you

00:00:05.879 --> 00:00:07.519 
interior video and then I'll show you
the<00:00:06.000> exterior<00:00:06.420> of<00:00:06.600> the<00:00:06.720> car<00:00:06.870> since<00:00:07.230> I've

00:00:07.519 --> 00:00:07.529 
the exterior of the car since I've

00:00:07.529 --> 00:00:11.200 
the exterior of the car since I've
gotten<00:00:08.010> some<00:00:08.189> better<00:00:08.809> lighting<00:00:09.809> conditions

00:00:11.200 --> 00:00:11.210 
gotten some better lighting conditions

00:00:11.210 --> 00:00:13.669 
gotten some better lighting conditions
this<00:00:12.210> car<00:00:12.660> does<00:00:12.929> have<00:00:13.110> the<00:00:13.290> cruise<00:00:13.559> control

00:00:13.669 --> 00:00:13.679 
this car does have the cruise control

00:00:13.679 --> 00:00:16.220 
this car does have the cruise control
feature<00:00:14.250> I<00:00:14.400> think<00:00:15.000> some<00:00:15.540> of<00:00:15.660> them<00:00:15.780> don't<00:00:15.990> have

00:00:16.220 --> 00:00:16.230 
feature I think some of them don't have

00:00:16.230 --> 00:00:18.560 
feature I think some of them don't have
the<00:00:16.289> cruise<00:00:16.680> control<00:00:16.800> not<00:00:17.640> positive

00:00:18.560 --> 00:00:18.570 
the cruise control not positive

00:00:18.570 --> 00:00:20.990 
the cruise control not positive
and<00:00:19.560> obviously<00:00:19.710> the<00:00:20.070> digital<00:00:20.430> dash<00:00:20.670> as<00:00:20.880> I

00:00:20.990 --> 00:00:21.000 
and obviously the digital dash as I

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:24.529 
and obviously the digital dash as I
talked<00:00:21.240> about<00:00:21.359> before<00:00:21.660> and<00:00:22.289> I<00:00:23.119> put<00:00:24.119> a<00:00:24.150> new

00:00:24.529 --> 00:00:24.539 
talked about before and I put a new

00:00:24.539 --> 00:00:26.900 
talked about before and I put a new
radio<00:00:24.990> win<00:00:25.199> since<00:00:25.470> the<00:00:25.650> old<00:00:25.980> radio<00:00:26.279> kind<00:00:26.789> of

00:00:26.900 --> 00:00:26.910 
radio win since the old radio kind of

00:00:26.910 --> 00:00:29.450 
radio win since the old radio kind of
sucked<00:00:27.210> the<00:00:27.660> tape<00:00:28.260> player<00:00:28.500> broken<00:00:29.039> and<00:00:29.220> not

00:00:29.450 --> 00:00:29.460 
sucked the tape player broken and not

00:00:29.460 --> 00:00:31.310 
sucked the tape player broken and not

this<00:00:52.500> car<00:00:52.800> when<00:00:53.100> I<00:00:53.129> first<00:00:53.670> got<00:00:53.910> it<00:00:54.120> I

00:00:54.770 --> 00:00:54.780 
this car when I first got it I

00:00:54.780 --> 00:00:57.619 
this car when I first got it I
discovered<00:00:55.620> in<00:00:56.280> the<00:00:56.579> glove<00:00:56.820> compartment

00:00:57.619 --> 00:00:57.629 
discovered in the glove compartment

00:00:57.629 --> 00:01:01.099 
discovered in the glove compartment
that<00:00:58.440> there<00:00:58.649> that<00:00:59.070> the<00:00:59.640> original<00:01:00.449> price<00:01:00.719> tag

00:01:01.099 --> 00:01:01.109 
that there that the original price tag

00:01:01.109 --> 00:01:06.320 
that there that the original price tag
was<00:01:01.410> in<00:01:01.559> it<00:01:01.710> so<00:01:02.780> that's<00:01:03.780> the<00:01:04.760> actual<00:01:05.760> price<00:01:06.000> tag

00:01:06.320 --> 00:01:06.330 
was in it so that's the actual price tag

00:01:06.330 --> 00:01:11.530 
was in it so that's the actual price tag
that<00:01:06.360> it<00:01:06.780> came<00:01:07.439> with<00:01:07.850> back<00:01:08.850> in<00:01:09.200> 1990<00:01:10.430> the

00:01:11.530 --> 00:01:11.540 
that it came with back in 1990 the

00:01:11.540 --> 00:01:15.980 
that it came with back in 1990 the
person<00:01:12.540> who<00:01:12.689> bought<00:01:12.930> this<00:01:13.200> paid<00:01:14.780> $17,000<00:01:15.780> and

00:01:15.980 --> 00:01:15.990 
person who bought this paid $17,000 and

00:01:15.990 --> 00:01:18.560 
person who bought this paid $17,000 and
30s<00:01:16.369> seventeen<00:01:17.369> thousand<00:01:17.880> thirty<00:01:18.119> dollars

00:01:18.560 --> 00:01:18.570 
30s seventeen thousand thirty dollars

00:01:18.570 --> 00:01:21.830 
30s seventeen thousand thirty dollars
and<00:01:19.530> I<00:01:19.979> went<00:01:20.340> on<00:01:20.430> a<00:01:20.549> google<00:01:20.820> and<00:01:21.180> I<00:01:21.330> found<00:01:21.570> out

00:01:21.830 --> 00:01:21.840 
and I went on a google and I found out

00:01:21.840 --> 00:01:26.410 
and I went on a google and I found out
that<00:01:22.170> that<00:01:22.580> equates<00:01:23.580> to<00:01:24.409> 35,000<00:01:25.409> about

00:01:26.410 --> 00:01:26.420 
that that equates to 35,000 about

00:01:26.420 --> 00:01:30.380 
that that equates to 35,000 about
$35,000<00:01:27.420> in<00:01:27.600> today's<00:01:27.869> currency<00:01:29.060> so<00:01:30.060> there's<00:01:30.270> a

00:01:30.380 --> 00:01:30.390 
$35,000 in today's currency so there's a

00:01:30.390 --> 00:01:35.950 
$35,000 in today's currency so there's a
lot<00:01:30.600> of<00:01:30.630> money<00:01:30.900> for<00:01:32.360> this<00:01:33.360> car<00:01:33.750> I<00:01:34.079> thought

00:01:35.950 --> 00:01:35.960 
lot of money for this car I thought

00:01:35.960 --> 00:01:39.920 
lot of money for this car I thought
that's<00:01:36.960> a<00:01:37.110> very<00:01:37.320> reliable<00:01:37.770> car<00:01:38.340> I<00:01:38.640> don't<00:01:39.630> know

00:01:39.920 --> 00:01:39.930 
that's a very reliable car I don't know

00:01:39.930 --> 00:01:42.200 
that's a very reliable car I don't know
why<00:01:40.079> so<00:01:40.590> many<00:01:40.650> people<00:01:40.829> at<00:01:41.250> times<00:01:41.549> complain

00:01:42.200 --> 00:01:42.210 
why so many people at times complain

00:01:42.210 --> 00:01:44.260 
why so many people at times complain
about<00:01:42.360> the<00:01:42.689> engine<00:01:43.470> inside<00:01:43.770> of<00:01:43.950> it<00:01:44.070> because

00:01:44.260 --> 00:01:44.270 
about the engine inside of it because

00:01:44.270 --> 00:01:47.929 
about the engine inside of it because
has<00:01:45.270> a<00:01:45.299> quad<00:01:45.689> 4<00:01:45.990> motor<00:01:46.259> and<00:01:46.560> apparently<00:01:47.070> people

00:01:47.929 --> 00:01:47.939 
has a quad 4 motor and apparently people

00:01:47.939 --> 00:01:50.840 
has a quad 4 motor and apparently people
didn't<00:01:48.689> like<00:01:48.869> them<00:01:49.170> I<00:01:49.470> finally<00:01:50.250> find<00:01:50.520> it<00:01:50.670> to<00:01:50.759> be

00:01:50.840 --> 00:01:50.850 
didn't like them I finally find it to be

00:01:50.850 --> 00:01:53.600 
didn't like them I finally find it to be
quite<00:01:50.880> powerful<00:01:51.329> compared<00:01:51.960> to<00:01:52.110> like<00:01:52.350> the<00:01:53.070> v6

00:01:53.600 --> 00:01:53.610 
quite powerful compared to like the v6

00:01:53.610 --> 00:01:56.510 
quite powerful compared to like the v6
that's<00:01:54.329> what<00:01:54.540> and<00:01:54.930> a<00:01:55.560> few<00:01:55.799> of<00:01:55.920> the<00:01:56.009> other<00:01:56.189> cars

00:01:56.510 --> 00:01:56.520 
that's what and a few of the other cars

00:01:56.520 --> 00:01:58.990 
that's what and a few of the other cars
have<00:01:56.700> had<00:01:56.850> had<00:01:57.479> v6<00:01:58.079> engines<00:01:58.500> and<00:01:58.710> it's<00:01:58.799> like

00:01:58.990 --> 00:01:59.000 
have had had v6 engines and it's like

00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:02.450 
have had had v6 engines and it's like
okay<00:02:00.380> flooring<00:02:01.380> it<00:02:01.530> right<00:02:01.740> now<00:02:01.920> practically

00:02:02.450 --> 00:02:02.460 
okay flooring it right now practically

00:02:02.460 --> 00:02:04.429 
okay flooring it right now practically
trying<00:02:02.820> to<00:02:02.880> get<00:02:03.000> up<00:02:03.060> this<00:02:03.180> hill<00:02:03.420> let's<00:02:03.780> go<00:02:04.079> and

00:02:04.429 --> 00:02:04.439 
trying to get up this hill let's go and

00:02:04.439 --> 00:02:07.340 
trying to get up this hill let's go and
still<00:02:04.799> losing<00:02:05.490> steel<00:02:05.969> this<00:02:06.210> cart<00:02:06.570> cruises

00:02:07.340 --> 00:02:07.350 
still losing steel this cart cruises

00:02:07.350 --> 00:02:09.260 
still losing steel this cart cruises
right<00:02:07.530> up<00:02:07.680> and<00:02:07.829> it's<00:02:07.979> not<00:02:08.099> even<00:02:08.369> the<00:02:08.550> high

00:02:09.260 --> 00:02:09.270 
right up and it's not even the high

00:02:09.270 --> 00:02:11.690 
right up and it's not even the high
output<00:02:09.709> versions<00:02:10.709> just<00:02:10.830> the<00:02:11.099> regular<00:02:11.250> quad

00:02:11.690 --> 00:02:11.700 
output versions just the regular quad

00:02:11.700 --> 00:02:12.920 
output versions just the regular quad
for<00:02:11.970> her

00:02:12.920 --> 00:02:12.930 
for her

00:02:12.930 --> 00:02:16.610 
for her
so<00:02:13.409> that's<00:02:13.530> a<00:02:13.620> good<00:02:13.799> engine<00:02:15.319> maybe<00:02:16.319> just

00:02:16.610 --> 00:02:16.620 
so that's a good engine maybe just

00:02:16.620 --> 00:02:18.740 
so that's a good engine maybe just
because<00:02:16.739> I<00:02:16.890> have<00:02:17.189> hardly<00:02:17.849> any<00:02:18.030> miles<00:02:18.269> on<00:02:18.629> this

00:02:18.740 --> 00:02:18.750 
because I have hardly any miles on this
