blowing<00:01:54.530> through<00:01:54.740> this<00:01:54.890> one<00:01:55.070> other<00:01:55.220> thing<00:01:55.460> is

00:01:55.570 --> 00:01:55.580 
blowing through this one other thing is

00:01:55.580 --> 00:01:57.850 
blowing through this one other thing is
done<00:01:55.759> or<00:01:56.060> any<00:01:56.899> other<00:01:57.140> test<00:01:57.410> that<00:01:57.560> it<00:01:57.649> fails

00:01:57.850 --> 00:01:57.860 
done or any other test that it fails

00:01:57.860 --> 00:02:00.130 
done or any other test that it fails
there<00:01:58.100> so<00:01:58.430> that's<00:01:59.300> the<00:01:59.479> testing<00:01:59.869> for<00:02:00.050> these

00:02:00.130 --> 00:02:00.140 
there so that's the testing for these

00:02:00.140 --> 00:02:04.749 
there so that's the testing for these
it's<00:02:00.440> very<00:02:00.710> easy<00:02:03.070> like<00:02:04.070> I<00:02:04.190> said<00:02:04.369> the<00:02:04.460> first<00:02:04.640> two

00:02:04.749 --> 00:02:04.759 
it's very easy like I said the first two

00:02:04.759 --> 00:02:08.340 
it's very easy like I said the first two
wouldn't<00:02:05.030> work<00:02:05.180> so<00:02:05.210> I<00:02:06.130> grew<00:02:07.130> up<00:02:07.190> the<00:02:07.310> third<00:02:07.490> one

00:02:08.340 --> 00:02:08.350 
wouldn't work so I grew up the third one

00:02:08.350 --> 00:02:10.810 
wouldn't work so I grew up the third one
off<00:02:09.350> of<00:02:09.410> the<00:02:09.649> deaths<00:02:09.920> out<00:02:10.160> of<00:02:10.190> the<00:02:10.369> seven<00:02:10.670> that

00:02:10.810 --> 00:02:10.820
