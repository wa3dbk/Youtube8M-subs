00:01:38.240 --> 00:01:40.910 
but still it's a great battery life
alright<00:01:39.240> so<00:01:39.360> I<00:01:39.390> definitely<00:01:39.689> say<00:01:40.320> the<00:01:40.470> 13-inch

00:01:40.910 --> 00:01:40.920 
alright so I definitely say the 13-inch

00:01:40.920 --> 00:01:42.260 
alright so I definitely say the 13-inch
model<00:01:41.159> is<00:01:41.400> definitely<00:01:41.909> a<00:01:41.939> good<00:01:42.119> buy

00:01:42.260 --> 00:01:42.270 
model is definitely a good buy

00:01:42.270 --> 00:01:43.520 
model is definitely a good buy
especially<00:01:42.509> if<00:01:42.810> you're<00:01:42.899> looking<00:01:42.990> to<00:01:43.290> get<00:01:43.380> into

00:01:43.520 --> 00:01:43.530 
especially if you're looking to get into

00:01:43.530 --> 00:01:45.230 
especially if you're looking to get into
a<00:01:43.619> Mac<00:01:43.860> with<00:01:44.040> not<00:01:44.189> dropping<00:01:44.610> too<00:01:44.790> much<00:01:44.970> money

00:01:45.230 --> 00:01:45.240 
a Mac with not dropping too much money

00:01:45.240 --> 00:01:47.450 
a Mac with not dropping too much money
for<00:01:46.110> the<00:01:46.229> 200<00:01:46.590> bucks<00:01:46.740> more<00:01:47.009> than<00:01:47.189> the<00:01:47.280> standard

00:01:47.450 --> 00:01:47.460 
for the 200 bucks more than the standard

00:01:47.460 --> 00:01:49.100 
for the 200 bucks more than the standard
macbook<00:01:48.060> model<00:01:48.360> you<00:01:48.450> get<00:01:48.540> to<00:01:48.659> the<00:01:48.750> aluminum

00:01:49.100 --> 00:01:49.110 
macbook model you get to the aluminum

00:01:49.110 --> 00:01:51.350 
macbook model you get to the aluminum
body<00:01:49.320> you<00:01:50.100> get<00:01:50.220> firewire<00:01:50.820> and<00:01:50.909> you<00:01:50.970> also<00:01:51.119> get<00:01:51.329> a

00:01:51.350 --> 00:01:51.360 
body you get firewire and you also get a

00:01:51.360 --> 00:01:52.850 
body you get firewire and you also get a
backlit<00:01:51.780> keyboard<00:01:51.990> so<00:01:52.290> i<00:01:52.350> think<00:01:52.409> the<00:01:52.590> display

00:01:52.850 --> 00:01:52.860 
backlit keyboard so i think the display

00:01:52.860 --> 00:01:54.280 
backlit keyboard so i think the display
looks<00:01:53.040> a<00:01:53.189> lot<00:01:53.310> nicer<00:01:53.460> too<00:01:53.820> so<00:01:54.030> I<00:01:54.060> think

00:01:54.280 --> 00:01:54.290 
looks a lot nicer too so I think

00:01:54.290 --> 00:01:56.090 
looks a lot nicer too so I think
personally<00:01:55.290> especially<00:01:55.500> if<00:01:55.799> you're<00:01:55.920> getting

00:01:56.090 --> 00:01:56.100 
personally especially if you're getting

00:01:56.100 --> 00:01:58.039 
personally especially if you're getting
a<00:01:56.280> score<00:01:56.670> like<00:01:56.880> it<00:01:57.000> at<00:01:57.090> education<00:01:57.630> discount

00:01:58.039 --> 00:01:58.049 
a score like it at education discount

00:01:58.049 --> 00:02:00.139 
a score like it at education discount
it's<00:01:58.140> worth<00:01:58.320> the<00:01:58.500> upgrade<00:01:58.530> now<00:01:59.490> who<00:01:59.759> this<00:01:59.939> is

00:02:00.139 --> 00:02:00.149 
it's worth the upgrade now who this is

00:02:00.149 --> 00:02:01.999 
it's worth the upgrade now who this is

in<00:02:10.950> video<00:02:11.159> production<00:02:11.459> I'd<00:02:11.879> say<00:02:12.090> save<00:02:12.390> your

00:02:12.410 --> 00:02:12.420 
in video production I'd say save your

00:02:12.420 --> 00:02:15.320 
in video production I'd say save your
money<00:02:12.810> go<00:02:13.379> up<00:02:13.530> to<00:02:13.709> the<00:02:13.830> i-5<00:02:14.340> at<00:02:14.580> least<00:02:14.940> now

00:02:15.320 --> 00:02:15.330 
money go up to the i-5 at least now

00:02:15.330 --> 00:02:17.600 
money go up to the i-5 at least now
don't<00:02:15.629> go<00:02:15.720> to<00:02:15.810> the<00:02:15.900> 2.66<00:02:16.739> version<00:02:17.190> of<00:02:17.280> this<00:02:17.400> I

00:02:17.600 --> 00:02:17.610 
don't go to the 2.66 version of this I

00:02:17.610 --> 00:02:19.550 
don't go to the 2.66 version of this I
think<00:02:18.030> that's<00:02:18.299> a<00:02:18.510> waste<00:02:18.690> of<00:02:18.870> money<00:02:18.930> so<00:02:19.230> I<00:02:19.260> say

00:02:19.550 --> 00:02:19.560 
think that's a waste of money so I say

00:02:19.560 --> 00:02:22.100 
think that's a waste of money so I say
either<00:02:19.769> stay<00:02:20.220> there<00:02:20.459> with<00:02:20.760> a<00:02:20.790> 2.4<00:02:21.510> version<00:02:21.930> or

00:02:22.100 --> 00:02:22.110 
either stay there with a 2.4 version or

00:02:22.110 --> 00:02:24.320 
either stay there with a 2.4 version or
jump<00:02:22.650> up<00:02:22.769> to<00:02:22.830> the<00:02:23.159> i-5<00:02:23.670> and<00:02:23.700> with<00:02:24.060> the<00:02:24.150> money

00:02:24.320 --> 00:02:24.330 
jump up to the i-5 and with the money

00:02:24.330 --> 00:02:27.229 
jump up to the i-5 and with the money
you<00:02:24.480> save<00:02:24.530> if<00:02:25.530> you<00:02:25.709> stay<00:02:25.920> a<00:02:25.950> 2.4<00:02:26.760> put<00:02:27.000> that<00:02:27.090> into

you save if you stay a 2.4 put that into

00:02:27.239 --> 00:02:28.789 
you save if you stay a 2.4 put that into
an<00:02:27.420> SSD<00:02:27.690> I<00:02:27.870> think<00:02:28.079> that's<00:02:28.230> going<00:02:28.349> to<00:02:28.440> be<00:02:28.560> a<00:02:28.590> lot

00:02:28.789 --> 00:02:28.799 
an SSD I think that's going to be a lot

00:02:28.799 --> 00:02:30.530 
an SSD I think that's going to be a lot
more<00:02:28.829> enjoyable<00:02:29.340> as<00:02:29.640> far<00:02:29.849> as<00:02:29.940> your<00:02:30.060> experience

00:02:30.530 --> 00:02:30.540 
more enjoyable as far as your experience

00:02:30.540 --> 00:02:32.149 
more enjoyable as far as your experience
you'll<00:02:30.989> notice<00:02:31.230> a<00:02:31.319> lot<00:02:31.470> more<00:02:31.709> I<00:02:31.739> guess

00:02:32.149 --> 00:02:32.159 
you'll notice a lot more I guess

00:02:32.159 --> 00:02:34.100 
you'll notice a lot more I guess
noticeable<00:02:32.819> speed<00:02:33.120> compared<00:02:33.569> to<00:02:33.599> jumping<00:02:33.959> up

00:02:34.100 --> 00:02:34.110 
noticeable speed compared to jumping up

00:02:34.110 --> 00:02:35.869 
noticeable speed compared to jumping up
it's<00:02:34.530> not<00:02:34.739> really<00:02:34.980> worth<00:02:35.159> the<00:02:35.370> money<00:02:35.400> so<00:02:35.849> all

00:02:35.869 --> 00:02:35.879 
it's not really worth the money so all

00:02:35.879 --> 00:02:38.360 
it's not really worth the money so all
in<00:02:36.209> all<00:02:36.329> I'd<00:02:37.049> say<00:02:37.409> it's<00:02:37.650> a<00:02:37.739> great<00:02:37.920> Buy<00:02:38.129> but<00:02:38.340> I

00:02:38.360 --> 00:02:38.370 
in all I'd say it's a great Buy but I

00:02:38.370 --> 00:02:40.190 
in all I'd say it's a great Buy but I
really<00:02:38.670> like<00:02:38.819> about<00:02:38.849> this<00:02:39.420> is<00:02:39.659> actually<00:02:40.049> the

00:02:40.190 --> 00:02:40.200 
really like about this is actually the

00:02:40.200 --> 00:02:42.830 
really like about this is actually the
size<00:02:40.470> and<00:02:40.769> it's<00:02:40.950> as<00:02:41.579> far<00:02:41.819> as<00:02:41.909> portability<00:02:42.690> it's

00:02:42.830 --> 00:02:42.840 
size and it's as far as portability it's

00:02:42.840 --> 00:02:44.150
