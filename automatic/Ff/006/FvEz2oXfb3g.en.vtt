00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.790
 even though it greet someone I greet you 

00:00:02.370 --> 00:00:07.319
 the jan and in what amount 

00:00:05.790 --> 00:00:10.099
 probably the biggest kite word 

00:00:07.319 --> 00:00:10.099
 fans but times 

00:00:28.699 --> 00:00:36.390
 penniless welcome to Nuremberg 

00:00:31.230 --> 00:00:38.550
 yes now I'm on the way to the radio z 

00:00:36.390 --> 00:00:41.690
 have already forgotten mobile phone in the car 

00:00:38.550 --> 00:00:46.790
 browse for 20 minutes 

00:00:41.690 --> 00:00:49.800
 Parking looking completely animal annoying 

00:00:46.790 --> 00:00:52.409
 I'm ahead and then it's me 

00:00:49.800 --> 00:00:57.269
 I wanted to see my camera 

00:00:52.409 --> 00:01:01.559
 forgot because I'm a little short 

00:00:57.269 --> 00:01:02.280
 Video makes where I then film and would 

00:01:01.559 --> 00:01:04.470
 I say 

00:01:02.280 --> 00:01:07.580
 have fun and see you soon 

00:01:04.470 --> 00:01:07.580
 again in the studio 

00:01:07.880 --> 00:01:15.530
 Now we are already sitting in the studio and 

00:01:11.250 --> 00:01:20.250
 will film a bit now 

00:01:15.530 --> 00:01:24.360
 yes and you wanted to greet someone 

00:01:20.250 --> 00:01:25.920
 greet you the jan and in what amount 

00:01:24.360 --> 00:01:26.930
 probably the biggest kite word 

00:01:25.920 --> 00:01:30.479
 fans of all time 

00:01:26.930 --> 00:01:33.630
 and there it already promised me that 

00:01:30.479 --> 00:01:36.060
 now get two autographs because 

00:01:33.630 --> 00:01:38.790
 that is the last party I am 

00:01:36.060 --> 00:01:41.130
 I have a total of five here 

00:01:38.790 --> 00:01:42.450
 piece of what three years maybe 

00:01:41.130 --> 00:01:44.940
 know that in this very special 

00:01:42.450 --> 00:01:48.330
 there is a directly in the studio we 

00:01:44.940 --> 00:01:50.820
 us the last two a little one 

00:01:48.330 --> 00:01:56.250
 big then to the other two 

00:01:50.820 --> 00:01:58.620
 close and me exactly to jan and me so 

00:01:56.250 --> 00:01:59.220
 yes and we will do it a bit more 

00:01:58.620 --> 00:02:03.780
 what to record 

00:01:59.220 --> 00:02:08.610
 exactly as guest wanted us in the 

00:02:03.780 --> 00:02:11.030
 studio the unique rainer rainer so 

00:02:08.610 --> 00:02:15.030
 but probably nobody knows him 

00:02:11.030 --> 00:02:16.920
 Everyone knows his saying exactly metal 

00:02:15.030 --> 00:02:19.440
 people conscious and welcome 

00:02:16.920 --> 00:02:25.489
 At the dragon there would be today with us 

00:02:19.440 --> 00:02:27.550
 frame guest in the studio extra 

00:02:25.489 --> 00:02:31.090
 the Middle Franconian 

00:02:27.550 --> 00:02:32.170
 province in the big city come so I 

00:02:31.090 --> 00:02:33.700
 I have the biggest part of the interviewer 

00:02:32.170 --> 00:02:35.370
 probably cut out because of it 

00:02:33.700 --> 00:02:37.630
 took a bit longer 

00:02:35.370 --> 00:02:40.990
 but you can do the whole interview 

00:02:37.630 --> 00:02:44.380
 anyway at radio z when exactly so on 

00:02:40.990 --> 00:02:48.760
 I hope that opens on Monday 

00:02:44.380 --> 00:02:50.980
 a short part runs the whole 

00:02:48.760 --> 00:02:54.070
 interview will probably be added 

00:02:50.980 --> 00:02:57.790
 eg decided metal program of radio 

00:02:54.070 --> 00:03:00.340
 zet and therefore actually more commercial 

00:02:57.790 --> 00:03:02.020
 senders are determined it is also in 

00:03:00.340 --> 00:03:02.790
 full length somewhere on the internet too 

00:03:02.020 --> 00:03:08.110
 be found 

00:03:02.790 --> 00:03:09.970
 of course, I will become one 

00:03:08.110 --> 00:03:12.250
 make a short blog as soon as it stops everything 

00:03:09.970 --> 00:03:14.770
 I think you can link to me 

00:03:12.250 --> 00:03:18.310
 send all-rounders and then I will 

00:03:14.770 --> 00:03:20.380
 you naturally laid and so then 

00:03:18.310 --> 00:03:22.180
 I will now, we are still a 

00:03:20.380 --> 00:03:23.620
 Do something and then I would be 

00:03:22.180 --> 00:03:26.670
 then on the way back a bit 

00:03:23.620 --> 00:03:28.930
 the car is so on the 

00:03:26.670 --> 00:03:29.830
 Christmas party or on the on the 

00:03:28.930 --> 00:03:31.690
 Christmas market I will today 

00:03:29.830 --> 00:03:32.739
 probably will not go anymore because of that 

00:03:31.690 --> 00:03:34.600
 is a bit late then 

00:03:32.739 --> 00:03:37.530
 and i can not get out 

00:03:34.600 --> 00:03:37.530
 probably again 

00:03:41.370 --> 00:03:46.630
 but then we'll be alright 

00:03:44.470 --> 00:03:48.280
 Again, I wanted too long 

00:03:46.630 --> 00:03:50.770
 wait for me to continue now because 

00:03:48.280 --> 00:03:53.530
 It's getting slow , I still have to 

00:03:50.770 --> 00:03:56.320
 already running to the very end 

00:03:53.530 --> 00:03:57.300
 I have an interesting interview 

00:03:56.320 --> 00:04:01.210
 made experiences 

00:03:57.300 --> 00:04:04.360
 at another station at radio zet 

00:04:01.210 --> 00:04:07.840
 I will now also radio z 

00:04:04.360 --> 00:04:09.900
 That's where I'm coming from wacken radio 

00:04:07.840 --> 00:04:12.550
 I'll probably be soon, too 

00:04:09.900 --> 00:04:14.290
 and when that's exactly what I know too 

00:04:12.550 --> 00:04:15.940
 not yet there I can not print 

00:04:14.290 --> 00:04:17.980
 because it's because of camburg I think so 

00:04:15.940 --> 00:04:22.480
 live in hamburg lokstedt at least 

00:04:17.980 --> 00:04:26.320
 At least once, look and see 

00:04:22.480 --> 00:04:28.690
 I'll probably have a small one there 

00:04:26.320 --> 00:04:30.400
 block by the way or before or 

00:04:28.690 --> 00:04:32.350
 after that and let you know when that 

00:04:30.400 --> 00:04:33.300
 is or if that is live if 

00:04:32.350 --> 00:04:36.160
 I do not predict 

00:04:33.300 --> 00:04:40.030
 then david could look inside 

00:04:36.160 --> 00:04:42.220
 yes that 's it then or thought the 

00:04:40.030 --> 00:04:43.510
 clutch well with it actually for 

00:04:42.220 --> 00:04:44.050
 watch what's next time 

00:04:43.510 --> 00:04:49.270
 again with it 

00:04:44.050 --> 00:04:50.710
 and yes an interesting day at or 

00:04:49.270 --> 00:04:54.190
 an interesting blog would be something 

00:04:50.710 --> 00:04:58.200
 completely different and see you next time 

00:04:54.190 --> 00:04:58.200
 pure and beautiful
