00:00:41.399 --> 00:00:46.649
 change this here for consensus so that 

00:00:43.710 --> 00:00:50.010

00:00:46.649 --> 00:00:52.440
 gift file is different let's vaccinate 

00:00:50.010 --> 00:00:54.239

00:00:52.440 --> 00:00:57.210
 save as it will give me options to 

00:00:54.239 --> 00:00:59.879
 save neno fireworks png file that is 

00:00:57.210 --> 00:01:02.160

 animated aas in formats here too 

00:01:02.160 --> 00:01:05.939
 guides but this format is not the gift 

00:01:03.989 --> 00:01:07.950
 That's great-grandson, it's not going to work. 

00:01:05.939 --> 00:01:10.290
 when the pedals was on my site he did not 

00:01:07.950 --> 00:01:13.170
 It's going to have animation so it's no use 

00:01:10.290 --> 00:01:14.130
 save on the menu is not my order at least 

00:01:13.170 --> 00:01:15.930
 to save 

00:01:14.130 --> 00:01:17.670
 and also does not give me and support 

00:01:15.930 --> 00:01:19.650
 The only way to save a steak is to 

00:01:17.670 --> 00:01:21.390
 option to view the image by 

00:01:19.650 --> 00:01:24.360
 here I have options to configure 

00:01:21.390 --> 00:01:26.610
 any other other 

00:01:24.360 --> 00:01:28.560
 project that I do I can export 

00:01:26.610 --> 00:01:30.180

 which is what already comes configured us 

00:01:34.619 --> 00:01:39.180
 we set there on the page so I 

00:01:36.780 --> 00:01:43.049
 I can control it here. 

00:01:39.180 --> 00:01:44.759

00:01:43.049 --> 00:01:47.250

00:01:47.250 --> 00:01:51.630
 It is to work so that it is with a 

00:01:49.680 --> 00:01:53.820
 smaller file is interesting you leave 

00:01:51.630 --> 00:01:56.670
 this option remove colors that I am not 

00:01:53.820 --> 00:01:58.470

00:01:56.670 --> 00:02:01.830
 can view 

00:01:58.470 --> 00:02:05.760
 in which he will stay in it the a in case 

00:02:01.830 --> 00:02:08.729

00:02:11.400 --> 00:02:16.140
 option to export the ex-porter 

00:02:13.860 --> 00:02:20.370
 which for example the images folder 

00:02:16.140 --> 00:02:22.740
 called is the test 

00:02:20.370 --> 00:02:24.480
 I will leave this option of only images 

00:02:22.740 --> 00:02:25.950
 I just want to eat but have to export 

00:02:24.480 --> 00:02:29.520

00:02:29.520 --> 00:02:33.630
 different features and have options here 

00:02:31.830 --> 00:02:35.940
 slices we'll see more for 

00:02:33.630 --> 00:02:38.550
 front also go there in the image folder 

00:02:35.940 --> 00:02:40.590
 could not post file one 

00:02:38.550 --> 00:02:43.560
 file has an internal error with 

00:02:40.590 --> 00:02:47.480
 Some internal problem here with my father. 

00:02:43.560 --> 00:02:47.480
 I 'll try again here 

00:02:49.330 --> 00:02:54.030
 the new test to save 

00:02:55.010 --> 00:02:59.989
 try to export it to another location 

00:02:57.110 --> 00:03:02.180
 probably in the folder of images he 

00:02:59.989 --> 00:03:03.319
 is not accepting because of some 

00:03:02.180 --> 00:03:05.090
 configuration 

00:03:03.319 --> 00:03:09.799
 so I'll put the name here again 

00:03:05.090 --> 00:03:13.450
 test or sportage here for example may 

00:03:09.799 --> 00:03:16.400
 be for documents 

00:03:13.450 --> 00:03:22.400
 Beauty documents make a folder that 

00:03:16.400 --> 00:03:23.260
 call fireworks walks i'll save it there 

00:03:22.400 --> 00:03:26.330
 inside 

00:03:23.260 --> 00:03:28.459
 Okay, so it 's just the same 

00:03:26.330 --> 00:03:31.010
 I came here in the documents and then open 

00:03:28.459 --> 00:03:33.590
 here is my test file I opened it 

00:03:31.010 --> 00:03:35.959

00:03:37.340 --> 00:03:40.940
 remember that a steak that goes 

00:03:38.930 --> 00:03:44.239

00:04:28.400 --> 00:04:31.639
 I have to go through the flash to do 

00:04:30.080 --> 00:04:33.440
 a modification of it by the flash will 

00:04:31.639 --> 00:04:35.780

00:04:33.440 --> 00:04:39.260

 with 75 already installed cs 6 ac and these 

00:04:44.720 --> 00:04:48.410

00:04:46.940 --> 00:04:51.410
 flash in other courses I'm showing 

00:04:48.410 --> 00:04:53.169
