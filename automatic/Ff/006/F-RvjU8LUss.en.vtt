00:01:56.660 --> 00:01:56.670 
really good Scout timing for him and he

00:01:56.670 --> 00:01:58.459 
really good Scout timing for him and he
put<00:01:56.850> down<00:01:56.939> his<00:01:57.000> backs<00:01:57.270> at<00:01:57.450> a<00:01:57.479> normal<00:01:57.719> time<00:01:57.869> so<00:01:58.439> I

00:01:58.459 --> 00:01:58.469 
put down his backs at a normal time so I

00:01:58.469 --> 00:01:59.749 
put down his backs at a normal time so I
wonder<00:01:58.740> if<00:01:58.799> he's<00:01:58.920> going<00:01:58.950> to<00:01:59.100> react<00:01:59.460> with<00:01:59.610> some

00:01:59.749 --> 00:01:59.759 
wonder if he's going to react with some

00:01:59.759 --> 00:02:01.160 
wonder if he's going to react with some
really<00:02:00.119> really<00:02:00.270> heavy<00:02:00.509> pressure<00:02:00.840> as<00:02:01.049> she

00:02:01.160 --> 00:02:01.170 
really really heavy pressure as she

00:02:01.170 --> 00:02:02.810 
really really heavy pressure as she
throws<00:02:01.350> up<00:02:01.439> his<00:02:01.619> gasps<00:02:01.890> and<00:02:02.310> starts<00:02:02.490> mining

00:02:02.810 --> 00:02:02.820 
throws up his gasps and starts mining

00:02:02.820 --> 00:02:05.480 
throws up his gasps and starts mining
pretty<00:02:03.030> immediately<00:02:03.619> yeah<00:02:04.619> presumably<00:02:05.250> he'll

00:02:05.480 --> 00:02:05.490 
pretty immediately yeah presumably he'll

00:02:05.490 --> 00:02:08.180 
pretty immediately yeah presumably he'll

hope<00:02:57.660> not<00:02:57.690> so<00:02:58.260> maybe<00:02:58.590> seeing<00:02:58.920> them<00:02:59.070> just<00:02:59.220> went

00:02:59.360 --> 00:02:59.370 
hope not so maybe seeing them just went

00:02:59.370 --> 00:03:00.950 
hope not so maybe seeing them just went
crazy<00:02:59.460> but<00:02:59.820> anyway<00:03:00.090> we<00:03:00.240> do<00:03:00.360> see<00:03:00.540> the<00:03:00.660> factory

00:03:00.950 --> 00:03:00.960 
crazy but anyway we do see the factory

00:03:00.960 --> 00:03:03.140 
crazy but anyway we do see the factory
going<00:03:01.230> down<00:03:01.380> but<00:03:01.890> similar<00:03:02.340> timing<00:03:02.640> so<00:03:02.940> last

00:03:03.140 --> 00:03:03.150 
going down but similar timing so last

00:03:03.150 --> 00:03:04.700 
going down but similar timing so last
time<00:03:03.300> as<00:03:03.480> we<00:03:03.630> see<00:03:03.780> that<00:03:03.990> size<00:03:04.200> going<00:03:04.470> to<00:03:04.560> made

00:03:04.700 --> 00:03:04.710 
time as we see that size going to made

00:03:04.710 --> 00:03:06.650 
time as we see that size going to made
on<00:03:04.860> his<00:03:04.980> drones<00:03:05.310> just<00:03:05.940> with<00:03:06.090> our<00:03:06.120> perfect

00:03:06.650 --> 00:03:06.660 
on his drones just with our perfect

00:03:06.660 --> 00:03:09.260 
on his drones just with our perfect
timing<00:03:06.840> from<00:03:06.930> him<00:03:07.140> as<00:03:07.260> well<00:03:07.440> and<00:03:07.680> I<00:03:08.340> think<00:03:08.520> the

00:03:09.260 --> 00:03:09.270 
timing from him as well and I think the

00:03:09.270 --> 00:03:10.610 
timing from him as well and I think the
Hellion<00:03:09.630> opening<00:03:09.930> has<00:03:10.020> just<00:03:10.140> become<00:03:10.260> so

00:03:10.610 --> 00:03:10.620 
Hellion opening has just become so

00:03:10.620 --> 00:03:13.040 
Hellion opening has just become so

fence about that because those are

00:03:33.510 --> 00:03:36.110

actually<00:03:41.550> like<00:03:41.850> to<00:03:41.940> see<00:03:42.090> him<00:03:42.270> expand<00:03:42.630> himself

00:03:43.040 --> 00:03:43.050 
actually like to see him expand himself

00:03:43.050 --> 00:03:44.690 
actually like to see him expand himself
so<00:03:43.410> you<00:03:43.500> can<00:03:43.620> see<00:03:43.740> a<00:03:43.770> longer<00:03:44.160> Makarov<00:03:44.550> game

00:03:44.690 --> 00:03:44.700 
so you can see a longer Makarov game

00:03:44.700 --> 00:03:46.040 
so you can see a longer Makarov game
rather<00:03:44.970> than<00:03:45.090> a<00:03:45.180> short<00:03:45.480> one<00:03:45.630> like<00:03:45.780> we<00:03:45.900> saw

00:03:46.040 --> 00:03:46.050 
rather than a short one like we saw

00:03:46.050 --> 00:03:48.320 
rather than a short one like we saw
before<00:03:46.080> SI<00:03:47.040> throws<00:03:47.400> down<00:03:47.550> a<00:03:47.580> roach<00:03:47.850> Warren<00:03:48.120> so

00:03:48.320 --> 00:03:48.330 
before SI throws down a roach Warren so

00:03:48.330 --> 00:03:49.820 
before SI throws down a roach Warren so
I<00:03:48.360> really<00:03:48.780> like<00:03:48.930> this<00:03:49.080> response<00:03:49.500> by<00:03:49.680> him

00:03:49.820 --> 00:03:49.830 
I really like this response by him

00:03:49.830 --> 00:03:51.890 
I really like this response by him
roaches<00:03:50.459> are<00:03:50.580> really<00:03:50.970> really<00:03:51.150> good<00:03:51.240> against

00:03:51.890 --> 00:03:51.900 
roaches are really really good against

00:03:51.900 --> 00:03:54.590 
roaches are really really good against
hellions<00:03:52.320> and<00:03:52.590> the<00:03:53.160> star<00:03:53.370> stable<00:03:53.760> solid<00:03:54.150> units

00:03:54.590 --> 00:03:54.600 
hellions and the star stable solid units

00:03:54.600 --> 00:03:56.150 
hellions and the star stable solid units
in<00:03:54.720> general<00:03:55.050> I<00:03:55.230> can't<00:03:55.590> wait<00:03:55.650> to<00:03:55.740> see<00:03:55.980> what

00:03:56.150 --> 00:03:56.160 
in general I can't wait to see what

00:03:56.160 --> 00:03:57.770 
in general I can't wait to see what
happens<00:03:56.280> after<00:03:56.880> the<00:03:57.000> patch<00:03:57.209> when<00:03:57.480> they<00:03:57.600> get

00:03:57.770 --> 00:03:57.780 
happens after the patch when they get

00:03:57.780 --> 00:04:00.290 
happens after the patch when they get
their<00:03:57.959> rich<00:03:58.110> range<00:03:58.410> increase<00:03:58.830> yeah<00:03:59.700> they

00:04:00.290 --> 00:04:00.300 
their rich range increase yeah they

00:04:00.300 --> 00:04:01.610 
their rich range increase yeah they
haven't<00:04:00.540> announced<00:04:00.720> exactly<00:04:01.200> what<00:04:01.410> they're

00:04:01.610 --> 00:04:01.620 
haven't announced exactly what they're

00:04:01.620 --> 00:04:03.650 
haven't announced exactly what they're
gonna<00:04:01.740> up<00:04:02.400> it<00:04:02.610> to<00:04:02.760> I<00:04:02.790> imagined<00:04:03.300> it's<00:04:03.420> gonna<00:04:03.540> be

00:04:03.650 --> 00:04:03.660 
gonna up it to I imagined it's gonna be

00:04:03.660 --> 00:04:05.420 
gonna up it to I imagined it's gonna be
around<00:04:03.750> for<00:04:04.110> I<00:04:04.410> don't<00:04:04.590> I<00:04:04.770> don't<00:04:04.860> imagine<00:04:05.160> like

00:04:05.420 --> 00:04:05.430 
around for I don't I don't imagine like

00:04:05.430 --> 00:04:08.840 
around for I don't I don't imagine like
a<00:04:05.459> huge<00:04:06.140> increase<00:04:07.140> I<00:04:07.470> do<00:04:07.620> like<00:04:08.010> a<00:04:08.070> rose<00:04:08.370> opening

00:04:08.840 --> 00:04:08.850 
a huge increase I do like a rose opening

00:04:08.850 --> 00:04:10.970 
a huge increase I do like a rose opening
more<00:04:09.060> than<00:04:09.180> I<00:04:09.209> do<00:04:09.360> a<00:04:09.390> ling<00:04:10.140> baneling<00:04:10.590> against

00:04:10.970 --> 00:04:10.980 
more than I do a ling baneling against

00:04:10.980 --> 00:04:13.370 
more than I do a ling baneling against
terran<00:04:11.570> it's<00:04:12.570> going<00:04:12.810> to<00:04:12.870> shut<00:04:13.080> down<00:04:13.110> these

00:04:13.370 --> 00:04:13.380 
terran it's going to shut down these

00:04:13.380 --> 00:04:15.620 
terran it's going to shut down these
hellions<00:04:13.800> this<00:04:14.489> factory's<00:04:14.880> going<00:04:15.000> to<00:04:15.060> be<00:04:15.120> you

00:04:15.620 --> 00:04:15.630 
hellions this factory's going to be you

00:04:15.630 --> 00:04:17.440 
hellions this factory's going to be you
know<00:04:15.720> pumping<00:04:16.200> them<00:04:16.290> out<00:04:16.380> two<00:04:16.620> at<00:04:16.709> a<00:04:16.770> time<00:04:16.799> now

00:04:17.440 --> 00:04:17.450 
know pumping them out two at a time now

00:04:17.450 --> 00:04:20.990 
know pumping them out two at a time now
and<00:04:18.450> yeah<00:04:19.350> sighs<00:04:20.190> doing<00:04:20.430> really<00:04:20.640> nice<00:04:20.790> job

00:04:20.990 --> 00:04:21.000 
and yeah sighs doing really nice job

00:04:21.000 --> 00:04:22.490 
and yeah sighs doing really nice job
spread<00:04:21.359> and<00:04:21.479> creep<00:04:21.630> into<00:04:21.840> between<00:04:22.140> these<00:04:22.350> two

00:04:22.490 --> 00:04:22.500 
spread and creep into between these two

00:04:22.500 --> 00:04:24.860 
spread and creep into between these two
bases<00:04:22.890> so<00:04:23.160> he'll<00:04:23.940> have<00:04:24.090> increased<00:04:24.360> mobility<00:04:24.600> I

00:04:24.860 --> 00:04:24.870 
bases so he'll have increased mobility I

00:04:24.870 --> 00:04:26.950 
bases so he'll have increased mobility I
think<00:04:25.200> I<00:04:25.260> just<00:04:25.320> saw<00:04:25.560> the<00:04:25.620> ghost<00:04:26.100> of<00:04:26.430> a

00:04:26.950 --> 00:04:26.960 
think I just saw the ghost of a

00:04:26.960 --> 00:04:29.210 
think I just saw the ghost of a
just<00:04:27.960> a<00:04:28.020> shadow<00:04:28.260> of<00:04:28.350> a<00:04:28.440> ghost<00:04:28.650> Academy<00:04:29.100> and

00:04:29.210 --> 00:04:29.220 
just a shadow of a ghost Academy and

00:04:29.220 --> 00:04:31.910 
just a shadow of a ghost Academy and
yeah<00:04:29.880> we're<00:04:30.390> back<00:04:30.840> of<00:04:31.050> the<00:04:31.110> base<00:04:31.260> so<00:04:31.530> it<00:04:31.710> looks

00:04:31.910 --> 00:04:31.920 
yeah we're back of the base so it looks

00:04:31.920 --> 00:04:34.150 
yeah we're back of the base so it looks
like<00:04:31.980> mike<00:04:32.910> is<00:04:33.120> going<00:04:33.300> to<00:04:33.390> stick<00:04:33.660> with<00:04:33.690> the

00:04:34.150 --> 00:04:34.160 
like mike is going to stick with the

00:04:34.160 --> 00:04:37.370 
like mike is going to stick with the
fast<00:04:35.160> nukes<00:04:35.550> here<00:04:35.820> yeah<00:04:36.780> if<00:04:36.870> it<00:04:36.990> ain't<00:04:37.110> broke

00:04:37.370 --> 00:04:37.380 
fast nukes here yeah if it ain't broke

00:04:37.380 --> 00:04:38.930 
fast nukes here yeah if it ain't broke
don't<00:04:37.410> fix<00:04:37.650> and<00:04:37.980> I<00:04:38.130> like<00:04:38.160> how<00:04:38.490> a<00:04:38.520> size

00:04:38.930 --> 00:04:38.940 
don't fix and I like how a size

00:04:38.940 --> 00:04:40.460 
don't fix and I like how a size
immediately<00:04:39.510> starting<00:04:39.780> to<00:04:39.900> spread<00:04:40.110> his<00:04:40.230> creep

00:04:40.460 --> 00:04:40.470 
immediately starting to spread his creep

00:04:40.470 --> 00:04:42.650 
immediately starting to spread his creep
forward<00:04:40.740> since<00:04:41.220> he<00:04:41.340> is<00:04:41.460> a<00:04:41.490> tramp<00:04:41.850> one<00:04:42.180> it's<00:04:42.600> a

00:04:42.650 --> 00:04:42.660 
forward since he is a tramp one it's a

00:04:42.660 --> 00:04:43.940 
forward since he is a tramp one it's a
little<00:04:42.900> easier<00:04:43.050> to<00:04:43.320> spread<00:04:43.500> your<00:04:43.590> creep

00:04:43.940 --> 00:04:43.950 
little easier to spread your creep

00:04:43.950 --> 00:04:45.470 
little easier to spread your creep
between<00:04:44.490> the<00:04:44.730> main<00:04:44.970> of<00:04:45.240> the<00:04:45.330> natural

00:04:45.470 --> 00:04:45.480 
between the main of the natural

00:04:45.480 --> 00:04:47.660 
between the main of the natural
disconnect<00:04:46.050> this<00:04:46.170> part<00:04:46.440> so<00:04:46.650> if<00:04:46.890> it's<00:04:47.340> any

00:04:47.660 --> 00:04:47.670 
disconnect this part so if it's any

00:04:47.670 --> 00:04:48.890 
disconnect this part so if it's any
early<00:04:48.000> aggression<00:04:48.300> you<00:04:48.510> can<00:04:48.630> deal<00:04:48.750> with<00:04:48.840> it

00:04:48.890 --> 00:04:48.900 
early aggression you can deal with it

00:04:48.900 --> 00:04:50.750 
early aggression you can deal with it
quite<00:04:49.200> easily<00:04:49.380> and<00:04:49.740> it<00:04:50.100> looks<00:04:50.220> like<00:04:50.280> mike<00:04:50.580> is

00:04:50.750 --> 00:04:50.760 
quite easily and it looks like mike is

00:04:50.760 --> 00:04:52.220 
quite easily and it looks like mike is
actually<00:04:51.030> deciding<00:04:51.390> to<00:04:51.510> take<00:04:51.750> down<00:04:52.050> these

00:04:52.220 --> 00:04:52.230 
actually deciding to take down these

00:04:52.230 --> 00:04:54.650 
actually deciding to take down these
rocks<00:04:52.530> over<00:04:52.830> here<00:04:52.860> arm<00:04:53.280> side<00:04:53.760> does<00:04:53.970> not<00:04:54.360> I

00:04:54.650 --> 00:04:54.660 
rocks over here arm side does not I

00:04:54.660 --> 00:04:56.300 
rocks over here arm side does not I
don't<00:04:54.990> think<00:04:55.170> he<00:04:55.260> had<00:04:55.410> vision<00:04:55.770> of<00:04:55.860> that<00:04:56.010> area

00:04:56.300 --> 00:04:56.310 
don't think he had vision of that area

00:04:56.310 --> 00:04:58.160 
don't think he had vision of that area
no<00:04:57.030> he<00:04:57.150> does<00:04:57.270> not<00:04:57.300> have<00:04:57.540> vision<00:04:57.810> of<00:04:57.900> that<00:04:58.020> area

00:04:58.160 --> 00:04:58.170 
no he does not have vision of that area

00:04:58.170 --> 00:04:59.780 
no he does not have vision of that area
so<00:04:58.440> it<00:04:58.500> might<00:04:58.620> be<00:04:58.650> quite<00:04:59.070> a<00:04:59.100> surprise<00:04:59.490> if<00:04:59.700> he

00:04:59.780 --> 00:04:59.790 
so it might be quite a surprise if he

00:04:59.790 --> 00:05:01.400 
so it might be quite a surprise if he
doesn't<00:05:00.120> move<00:05:00.450> to<00:05:00.630> that<00:05:00.750> location<00:05:00.900> of<00:05:01.230> time

00:05:01.400 --> 00:05:01.410 
doesn't move to that location of time

00:05:01.410 --> 00:05:04.040 
doesn't move to that location of time
but<00:05:01.650> sing<00:05:02.010> out<00:05:02.160> a<00:05:02.190> scout<00:05:02.570> really<00:05:03.570> good<00:05:03.720> timing

00:05:04.040 --> 00:05:04.050 
but sing out a scout really good timing

00:05:04.050 --> 00:05:05.360 
but sing out a scout really good timing
but<00:05:04.140> he<00:05:04.260> I<00:05:04.410> don't<00:05:04.470> know<00:05:04.890> if<00:05:04.980> he's<00:05:05.070> gonna<00:05:05.160> see

00:05:05.360 --> 00:05:05.370 
but he I don't know if he's gonna see

00:05:05.370 --> 00:05:07.400 
but he I don't know if he's gonna see
that<00:05:05.490> Ghost<00:05:05.790> academy<00:05:06.180> at<00:05:06.270> the<00:05:06.300> back<00:05:06.570> if<00:05:07.170> he<00:05:07.290> was

00:05:07.400 --> 00:05:07.410 
that Ghost academy at the back if he was

00:05:07.410 --> 00:05:08.480 
that Ghost academy at the back if he was
watching<00:05:07.650> the<00:05:07.710> stream<00:05:07.860> before<00:05:08.070> he's<00:05:08.310> going<00:05:08.430> to

00:05:08.480 --> 00:05:08.490 
watching the stream before he's going to

00:05:26.510 --> 00:05:26.520 
depots and I guess there's really no

00:05:26.520 --> 00:05:29.090 
depots and I guess there's really no
reason<00:05:26.670> to<00:05:27.000> uh<00:05:27.110> to<00:05:28.110> check<00:05:28.440> anywhere<00:05:28.830> else<00:05:28.980> in

00:05:29.090 --> 00:05:29.100 
reason to uh to check anywhere else in

00:05:29.100 --> 00:05:31.910 
reason to uh to check anywhere else in
the<00:05:29.160> base<00:05:29.840> fresh<00:05:30.840> distance<00:05:31.200> as<00:05:31.470> we<00:05:31.740> said

00:05:31.910 --> 00:05:31.920 
the base fresh distance as we said

00:05:31.920 --> 00:05:33.620 
the base fresh distance as we said
before<00:05:31.950> is<00:05:32.370> short<00:05:32.670> on<00:05:32.730> this<00:05:32.910> map<00:05:33.060> but<00:05:33.360> Mike<00:05:33.600> is

00:05:33.620 --> 00:05:33.630 
before is short on this map but Mike is

00:05:33.630 --> 00:05:35.900 
before is short on this map but Mike is
just<00:05:34.320> gonna<00:05:34.410> bust<00:05:35.010> down<00:05:35.160> the<00:05:35.280> rocks<00:05:35.490> and<00:05:35.700> make

00:05:35.900 --> 00:05:35.910 
just gonna bust down the rocks and make

00:05:35.910 --> 00:05:39.380 
just gonna bust down the rocks and make
the<00:05:36.060> distance<00:05:36.410> a<00:05:37.410> lot<00:05:38.160> shorter<00:05:38.460> he's<00:05:39.120> getting

00:05:39.380 --> 00:05:39.390 
the distance a lot shorter he's getting

00:05:39.390 --> 00:05:42.500 
the distance a lot shorter he's getting
out<00:05:39.480> those<00:05:39.660> those<00:05:40.530> ghosts<00:05:41.100> and<00:05:41.310> stem<00:05:41.760> no<00:05:42.240> nuke

00:05:42.500 --> 00:05:42.510 
out those those ghosts and stem no nuke
