just get those the order of those caused
to<00:02:13.830> your<00:02:13.920> head<00:02:14.220> and<00:02:14.430> make<00:02:14.940> sure<00:02:14.970> you<00:02:15.240> can

00:02:18.260 --> 00:02:18.270 
change between them just like that okay

00:02:18.270 --> 00:02:20.840 
change between them just like that okay
now<00:02:18.480> if<00:02:19.290> you<00:02:19.560> can<00:02:19.709> do<00:02:19.860> that<00:02:20.040> it's<00:02:20.340> time<00:02:20.640> for<00:02:20.790> the

00:02:20.840 --> 00:02:20.850 
now if you can do that it's time for the

00:02:20.850 --> 00:02:22.850 
now if you can do that it's time for the
rhythm<00:02:21.090> pattern<00:02:21.240> so<00:02:21.900> the<00:02:22.170> rhythm<00:02:22.470> pattern<00:02:22.590> we

00:02:22.850 --> 00:02:22.860 
rhythm pattern so the rhythm pattern we

00:02:22.860 --> 00:02:25.670 
rhythm pattern so the rhythm pattern we
break<00:02:23.070> into<00:02:23.280> two<00:02:23.640> bars<00:02:24.330> okay<00:02:24.870> the<00:02:25.050> first<00:02:25.290> bar

00:02:25.670 --> 00:02:25.680 
break into two bars okay the first bar

00:02:25.680 --> 00:02:27.170 
break into two bars okay the first bar
is<00:02:25.860> as<00:02:26.310> simple<00:02:26.640> as<00:02:26.760> this

00:02:27.170 --> 00:02:27.180 
is as simple as this

00:02:27.180 --> 00:02:33.530 
is as simple as this

what one two three four so on the G we

00:02:33.540 --> 00:02:35.540 
what one two three four so on the G we
literally<00:02:33.780> only<00:02:33.900> hit<00:02:34.170> two<00:02:34.560> beats<00:02:34.920> okay<00:02:35.160> on<00:02:35.430> the

00:02:35.540 --> 00:02:35.550 
literally only hit two beats okay on the

00:02:35.550 --> 00:02:39.290 
literally only hit two beats okay on the
first<00:02:35.580> beat<00:02:36.150> and<00:02:36.510> on<00:02:37.320> the<00:02:37.470> third<00:02:37.770> beat<00:02:38.150> no<00:02:39.150> in

first beat and on the third beat no in
between<00:02:39.480> those<00:02:40.020> beats<00:02:40.320> I'm<00:02:40.470> still<00:02:40.740> moving<00:02:40.890> my

00:02:41.210 --> 00:02:41.220 
between those beats I'm still moving my

00:02:41.220 --> 00:02:43.820 
between those beats I'm still moving my
arm<00:02:41.400> okay<00:02:42.150> so<00:02:42.600> if<00:02:42.690> you<00:02:42.810> notice<00:02:43.200> if<00:02:43.320> I<00:02:43.410> count<00:02:43.680> out

00:03:52.720 --> 00:03:52.730 
okay so on the G we got one two three

00:03:52.730 --> 00:04:00.489 
okay so on the G we got one two three
four<00:03:54.799> one<00:03:55.799> and<00:03:56.159> two<00:03:56.819> and<00:03:57.209> three<00:03:57.269> and<00:03:58.200> four<00:03:58.439> and

four one and two and three and four and
okay<00:04:01.499> let<00:04:02.249> me<00:04:02.340> do<00:04:02.459> that<00:04:02.549> nice<00:04:02.730> and<00:04:02.939> slow<00:04:03.090> again

00:04:03.349 --> 00:04:03.359 
okay let me do that nice and slow again

00:04:03.359 --> 00:04:09.709 
okay let me do that nice and slow again
one<00:04:04.349> two<00:04:05.269> three<00:04:06.269> four<00:04:07.139> one<00:04:08.040> and<00:04:08.400> two<00:04:08.939> and<00:04:09.239> three

00:04:09.719 --> 00:04:14.899 
one two three four one and two and three
and<00:04:10.230> four<00:04:12.319> okay<00:04:13.319> so<00:04:13.739> we<00:04:14.159> can<00:04:14.280> break<00:04:14.430> it<00:04:14.489> up<00:04:14.700> nice

00:04:14.899 --> 00:04:14.909 
and four okay so we can break it up nice

00:04:14.909 --> 00:04:16.969 
and four okay so we can break it up nice
and<00:04:14.939> clearly<00:04:15.569> in<00:04:15.659> our<00:04:15.810> head<00:04:16.079> between<00:04:16.259> the<00:04:16.470> G<00:04:16.799> be

00:04:16.969 --> 00:04:16.979 
and clearly in our head between the G be

00:04:16.979 --> 00:04:18.830 
and clearly in our head between the G be
in<00:04:17.099> the<00:04:17.190> first<00:04:17.430> bar<00:04:17.729> with<00:04:18.209> the<00:04:18.329> first<00:04:18.570> rhythm

00:04:18.830 --> 00:04:18.840 
in the first bar with the first rhythm

00:04:18.840 --> 00:04:20.990 
in the first bar with the first rhythm
pattern<00:04:19.199> the<00:04:19.620> DB<00:04:20.099> and<00:04:20.250> the<00:04:20.310> second<00:04:20.699> bar<00:04:20.849> with

00:04:20.990 --> 00:04:21.000 
pattern the DB and the second bar with

00:04:21.000 --> 00:04:22.790 
pattern the DB and the second bar with
the<00:04:21.090> second<00:04:21.479> rhythm<00:04:21.690> pattern<00:04:22.019> and<00:04:22.199> then<00:04:22.650> when

00:04:22.790 --> 00:04:22.800 
the second rhythm pattern and then when

00:04:22.800 --> 00:04:25.010 
the second rhythm pattern and then when
you<00:04:22.889> move<00:04:23.070> to<00:04:23.099> the<00:04:23.310> a<00:04:23.520> minor<00:04:23.970> you<00:04:24.419> merge<00:04:24.750> the

00:04:25.010 --> 00:04:25.020 
you move to the a minor you merge the

00:04:25.020 --> 00:04:27.379 
you move to the a minor you merge the
two<00:04:25.229> so<00:04:25.889> cuz<00:04:26.099> you<00:04:26.220> are<00:04:26.250> a<00:04:26.370> minor<00:04:26.759> for<00:04:26.970> two<00:04:27.000> bars

00:04:27.379 --> 00:04:27.389 
two so cuz you are a minor for two bars

00:04:27.389 --> 00:04:29.330 
two so cuz you are a minor for two bars
you<00:04:28.139> did<00:04:28.289> the<00:04:28.380> first<00:04:28.620> for<00:04:28.770> the<00:04:28.860> pattern<00:04:29.190> and

00:04:29.330 --> 00:04:29.340 
you did the first for the pattern and

00:04:29.340 --> 00:04:30.499 
you did the first for the pattern and
then<00:04:29.460> the<00:04:29.580> second<00:04:29.880> rhythm<00:04:30.060> pattern<00:04:30.330> like<00:04:30.479> this

00:04:30.499 --> 00:04:30.509 
then the second rhythm pattern like this

00:04:30.509 --> 00:04:36.260 
then the second rhythm pattern like this
one<00:04:31.470> two<00:04:32.310> three<00:04:33.300> four<00:04:34.139> one<00:04:35.009> and<00:04:35.460> two<00:04:35.550> and<00:04:36.210> three

00:04:36.260 --> 00:04:36.270 
one two three four one and two and three

00:04:36.270 --> 00:04:39.830 
one two three four one and two and three
and<00:04:37.080> four

00:04:39.830 --> 00:04:39.840 

00:04:39.840 --> 00:04:42.600 

okay<00:04:40.840> and<00:04:41.170> that's<00:04:41.740> the<00:04:41.920> rhythm<00:04:42.100> pattern<00:04:42.520> you

00:04:42.600 --> 00:04:42.610 
okay and that's the rhythm pattern you

00:04:42.610 --> 00:04:45.540 
okay and that's the rhythm pattern you
can<00:04:42.700> use<00:04:42.910> throughout<00:04:43.830> so<00:04:44.830> let<00:04:45.070> me<00:04:45.190> just<00:04:45.370> kind

00:04:45.540 --> 00:04:45.550 
can use throughout so let me just kind

00:04:45.550 --> 00:04:46.860 
can use throughout so let me just kind
of<00:04:45.670> play<00:04:45.940> it<00:04:46.030> through<00:04:46.270> for<00:04:46.510> you<00:04:46.570> nice<00:04:46.840> and

00:04:46.860 --> 00:04:46.870 
of play it through for you nice and

00:04:46.870 --> 00:04:49.530 
of play it through for you nice and
slowly<00:04:47.440> okay<00:04:48.130> make<00:04:48.730> sure<00:04:48.760> you<00:04:49.030> get<00:04:49.150> all<00:04:49.330> the

00:04:49.530 --> 00:04:49.540 
slowly okay make sure you get all the

00:04:49.540 --> 00:04:51.420 
slowly okay make sure you get all the
individual<00:04:50.110> parts<00:04:50.470> before<00:04:50.620> you<00:04:50.830> start<00:04:51.100> gluing

00:04:51.420 --> 00:04:51.430 
individual parts before you start gluing

00:04:51.430 --> 00:04:53.850 
individual parts before you start gluing
it<00:04:51.520> together<00:04:51.820> but<00:04:52.030> it<00:04:52.120> goes<00:04:52.240> like<00:04:52.330> this<00:04:52.860> one

00:04:53.850 --> 00:04:53.860 
it together but it goes like this one

00:04:53.860 --> 00:04:59.940 
it together but it goes like this one
two<00:04:54.930> three<00:04:55.930> four<00:04:56.890> one<00:04:57.880> and<00:04:58.180> two<00:04:58.570> and<00:04:59.020> three<00:04:59.050> and
