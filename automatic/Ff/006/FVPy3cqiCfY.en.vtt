hey guys what is up it is SST mentleman
here<00:00:02.250> with<00:00:02.340> guides<00:00:02.520> for<00:00:02.700> us<00:00:02.790> all<00:00:02.970> and<00:00:03.090> today

00:00:03.230 --> 00:00:03.240 
here with guides for us all and today

00:00:03.240 --> 00:00:04.160 
here with guides for us all and today
I'm<00:00:03.300> going<00:00:03.419> to<00:00:03.480> be<00:00:03.540> showing<00:00:03.689> you<00:00:03.810> how<00:00:03.870> to<00:00:03.990> get

00:00:04.160 --> 00:00:04.170 
I'm going to be showing you how to get

00:00:04.170 --> 00:00:06.349 
I'm going to be showing you how to get
the<00:00:04.290> rage<00:00:04.500> mod<00:00:04.799> in<00:00:05.069> warframe<00:00:05.609> so<00:00:06.000> there<00:00:06.240> is

00:00:06.349 --> 00:00:06.359 
the rage mod in warframe so there is

00:00:06.359 --> 00:00:08.480 
the rage mod in warframe so there is
only<00:00:06.600> one<00:00:07.080> enemy<00:00:07.319> that<00:00:07.470> drops<00:00:07.830> this<00:00:08.040> mod<00:00:08.250> and

00:00:08.480 --> 00:00:08.490 
only one enemy that drops this mod and

00:00:08.490 --> 00:00:10.310 
only one enemy that drops this mod and
you're<00:00:08.580> going<00:00:08.700> to<00:00:08.730> want<00:00:08.910> to<00:00:09.000> head<00:00:09.210> to<00:00:09.480> survival

00:00:10.310 --> 00:00:10.320 
you're going to want to head to survival

00:00:10.320 --> 00:00:12.860 
you're going to want to head to survival
on<00:00:10.530> Mars<00:00:10.980> to<00:00:11.370> do<00:00:11.519> it<00:00:11.639> or<00:00:11.759> mercury<00:00:11.940> rather<00:00:12.450> to<00:00:12.719> do

00:00:12.860 --> 00:00:12.870 
on Mars to do it or mercury rather to do

00:00:12.870 --> 00:00:14.900 
on Mars to do it or mercury rather to do
that<00:00:13.080> and<00:00:13.320> the<00:00:14.099> reason<00:00:14.280> I'm<00:00:14.519> doing<00:00:14.639> that<00:00:14.790> is

00:00:14.900 --> 00:00:14.910 
that and the reason I'm doing that is

00:00:14.910 --> 00:00:17.300 
that and the reason I'm doing that is
because<00:00:15.030> it<00:00:15.389> only<00:00:15.540> drops<00:00:16.020> from<00:00:16.379> the<00:00:16.770> napalm

00:00:17.300 --> 00:00:17.310 
because it only drops from the napalm

00:00:17.310 --> 00:00:19.910 
because it only drops from the napalm
the<00:00:17.640> grenier<00:00:17.970> napalm<00:00:18.420> and<00:00:18.630> since<00:00:19.529> the<00:00:19.650> grenade

00:00:19.910 --> 00:00:19.920 
the grenier napalm and since the grenade

00:00:19.920 --> 00:00:21.170 
the grenier napalm and since the grenade
or<00:00:19.980> napalm<00:00:20.250> is<00:00:20.400> the<00:00:20.490> only<00:00:20.609> one<00:00:20.760> that<00:00:20.880> drops<00:00:21.029> it

00:00:21.170 --> 00:00:21.180 
or napalm is the only one that drops it

00:00:21.180 --> 00:00:22.220 
or napalm is the only one that drops it
you're<00:00:21.270> going<00:00:21.449> to<00:00:21.570> want<00:00:21.689> to<00:00:21.720> be<00:00:21.810> fighting<00:00:22.140> the

00:00:22.220 --> 00:00:22.230 
you're going to want to be fighting the

00:00:22.230 --> 00:00:24.050 
you're going to want to be fighting the
lowest<00:00:22.560> level<00:00:22.830> May<00:00:22.949> palms<00:00:23.220> that<00:00:23.400> you<00:00:23.519> can<00:00:23.789> as

00:00:24.050 --> 00:00:24.060 
lowest level May palms that you can as

00:00:24.060 --> 00:00:26.060 
lowest level May palms that you can as
you<00:00:24.390> can<00:00:24.630> see<00:00:24.779> here<00:00:25.109> they<00:00:25.590> start<00:00:25.859> spawning

00:00:26.060 --> 00:00:26.070 
you can see here they start spawning

00:00:26.070 --> 00:00:28.700 
you can see here they start spawning
around<00:00:26.550> 20<00:00:27.029> minutes<00:00:27.210> into<00:00:27.930> a<00:00:27.960> survival<00:00:28.529> match

00:00:28.700 --> 00:00:28.710 
around 20 minutes into a survival match

00:00:28.710 --> 00:00:30.080 
around 20 minutes into a survival match
so<00:00:29.070> it's<00:00:29.279> going<00:00:29.429> to<00:00:29.490> take<00:00:29.609> a<00:00:29.640> while<00:00:29.849> to<00:00:29.970> get

00:00:30.080 --> 00:00:30.090 
so it's going to take a while to get

00:00:30.090 --> 00:00:32.120 
so it's going to take a while to get
those<00:00:30.210> napalm<00:00:30.720> spawning<00:00:31.170> but<00:00:31.560> survival<00:00:32.040> is

00:00:32.120 --> 00:00:32.130 
those napalm spawning but survival is

00:00:32.130 --> 00:00:34.160 
those napalm spawning but survival is
probably<00:00:32.430> the<00:00:32.550> best<00:00:32.730> way<00:00:32.940> to<00:00:33.180> find<00:00:33.840> a<00:00:34.020> high

00:00:34.160 --> 00:00:34.170 
probably the best way to find a high

00:00:34.170 --> 00:00:35.959 
probably the best way to find a high
surplus<00:00:34.620> of<00:00:34.739> enemies<00:00:35.130> that<00:00:35.340> you<00:00:35.460> want<00:00:35.640> to<00:00:35.730> kill

00:00:35.959 --> 00:00:35.969 
surplus of enemies that you want to kill

00:00:35.969 --> 00:00:38.690 
surplus of enemies that you want to kill
so<00:00:36.329> a<00:00:36.540> lot<00:00:37.140> of<00:00:37.290> people<00:00:37.590> have<00:00:37.920> found<00:00:38.280> this<00:00:38.520> mod

00:00:38.690 --> 00:00:38.700 
so a lot of people have found this mod

00:00:38.700 --> 00:00:40.010 
so a lot of people have found this mod
here<00:00:39.030> in<00:00:39.149> the<00:00:39.239> survival<00:00:39.540> mission<00:00:39.840> and<00:00:39.960> that's

00:00:40.010 --> 00:00:40.020 
here in the survival mission and that's

00:00:40.020 --> 00:00:41.780 
here in the survival mission and that's
why<00:00:40.230> I<00:00:40.260> selected<00:00:40.890> this<00:00:41.040> you<00:00:41.190> can<00:00:41.309> also<00:00:41.489> do

00:00:41.780 --> 00:00:41.790 
why I selected this you can also do

00:00:41.790 --> 00:00:43.430 
why I selected this you can also do
mobile<00:00:42.149> defense<00:00:42.329> if<00:00:42.780> there<00:00:42.989> is<00:00:43.140> one<00:00:43.350> on

00:00:43.430 --> 00:00:43.440 
mobile defense if there is one on

00:00:43.440 --> 00:00:45.860 
mobile defense if there is one on
Mercury<00:00:43.950> I'm<00:00:44.100> not<00:00:44.280> exactly<00:00:44.579> sure<00:00:44.760> and<00:00:45.210> you

00:00:45.860 --> 00:00:45.870 
Mercury I'm not exactly sure and you

00:00:45.870 --> 00:00:47.540 
Mercury I'm not exactly sure and you
could<00:00:45.989> also<00:00:46.200> do<00:00:46.590> just<00:00:46.860> a<00:00:46.920> normal<00:00:47.250> defense

00:00:47.540 --> 00:00:47.550 
could also do just a normal defense

00:00:47.550 --> 00:00:48.860 
could also do just a normal defense
mission<00:00:47.850> whichever<00:00:48.149> one<00:00:48.300> is<00:00:48.390> your<00:00:48.510> favorite

00:00:48.860 --> 00:00:48.870 
mission whichever one is your favorite

00:00:48.870 --> 00:00:50.360 
mission whichever one is your favorite
but<00:00:48.989> I<00:00:49.020> believe<00:00:49.410> the<00:00:49.530> survival<00:00:50.010> is<00:00:50.100> the<00:00:50.129> best

00:00:50.360 --> 00:00:50.370 
but I believe the survival is the best

00:00:50.370 --> 00:00:51.439 
but I believe the survival is the best
way<00:00:50.489> to<00:00:50.550> find<00:00:50.789> the<00:00:50.879> napalm<00:00:51.239> 's

00:00:51.439 --> 00:00:51.449 
way to find the napalm 's

00:00:51.449 --> 00:00:53.180 
way to find the napalm 's
anyways<00:00:52.079> pretty<00:00:52.379> much<00:00:52.530> everybody<00:00:53.039> that's

found this mod that's posted comments on

00:00:54.870 --> 00:00:56.299 
found this mod that's posted comments on
the<00:00:54.960> page<00:00:55.140> in<00:00:55.320> the<00:00:55.410> wiki<00:00:55.559> said<00:00:55.890> they<00:00:56.010> found<00:00:56.190> it

00:00:56.299 --> 00:00:56.309 
the page in the wiki said they found it

00:00:56.309 --> 00:00:59.569 
the page in the wiki said they found it
here<00:00:56.579> on<00:00:56.780> Apollodorus<00:00:57.780> mercury<00:00:58.710> and<00:00:58.980> that's

00:00:59.569 --> 00:00:59.579 
here on Apollodorus mercury and that's

00:00:59.579 --> 00:01:01.790 
here on Apollodorus mercury and that's
where<00:00:59.760> I<00:00:59.789> went<00:01:00.000> to<00:01:00.149> farm<00:01:00.390> it<00:01:00.559> unfortunately<00:01:01.559> I

00:01:01.790 --> 00:01:01.800 
where I went to farm it unfortunately I

00:01:01.800 --> 00:01:03.410 
where I went to farm it unfortunately I
was<00:01:02.219> not<00:01:02.370> successful<00:01:02.550> in<00:01:02.910> getting<00:01:03.000> this<00:01:03.239> due

00:01:03.410 --> 00:01:03.420 
was not successful in getting this due

00:01:03.420 --> 00:01:06.080 
was not successful in getting this due
to<00:01:03.449> the<00:01:03.629> fact<00:01:03.660> that<00:01:04.080> the<00:01:04.710> rage<00:01:05.010> mod<00:01:05.339> has<00:01:05.640> like<00:01:05.909> a

00:01:06.080 --> 00:01:06.090 
to the fact that the rage mod has like a

00:01:06.090 --> 00:01:09.469 
to the fact that the rage mod has like a
0.01<00:01:07.080> percent<00:01:07.470> chance<00:01:07.920> of<00:01:08.189> dropping<00:01:08.490> meaning

00:01:09.469 --> 00:01:09.479 
0.01 percent chance of dropping meaning

00:01:09.479 --> 00:01:11.690 
0.01 percent chance of dropping meaning
you'd<00:01:09.630> have<00:01:09.810> to<00:01:09.960> kill<00:01:10.200> quite<00:01:10.920> a<00:01:10.950> lot<00:01:11.189> of<00:01:11.310> napalm

00:01:11.690 --> 00:01:11.700 
you'd have to kill quite a lot of napalm

00:01:11.700 --> 00:01:14.240 
you'd have to kill quite a lot of napalm
to<00:01:11.970> get<00:01:12.119> it<00:01:12.240> so<00:01:12.510> there<00:01:13.439> are<00:01:13.619> two<00:01:13.860> other<00:01:14.070> ways

00:01:14.240 --> 00:01:14.250 
to get it so there are two other ways

00:01:14.250 --> 00:01:16.460 
to get it so there are two other ways
that<00:01:14.460> you<00:01:14.520> can<00:01:14.700> get<00:01:14.820> this<00:01:15.259> obviously<00:01:16.259> through

00:01:16.460 --> 00:01:16.470 
that you can get this obviously through

00:01:16.470 --> 00:01:17.899 
that you can get this obviously through
transmutation<00:01:17.250> I'll<00:01:17.369> show<00:01:17.460> you<00:01:17.549> a<00:01:17.580> couple<00:01:17.759> of

00:01:17.899 --> 00:01:17.909 
transmutation I'll show you a couple of

00:01:17.909 --> 00:01:20.060 
transmutation I'll show you a couple of
transmutations<00:01:18.630> I<00:01:18.720> did<00:01:18.869> here<00:01:19.200> I<00:01:19.350> was<00:01:19.680> not<00:01:19.799> able

00:01:20.060 --> 00:01:20.070 
transmutations I did here I was not able

00:01:20.070 --> 00:01:21.560 
transmutations I did here I was not able
to<00:01:20.159> get<00:01:20.369> the<00:01:20.460> rage<00:01:20.610> mod<00:01:20.850> but<00:01:21.090> I<00:01:21.119> did<00:01:21.390> get<00:01:21.540> a

00:01:21.560 --> 00:01:21.570 
to get the rage mod but I did get a

00:01:21.570 --> 00:01:23.270 
to get the rage mod but I did get a
split<00:01:21.720> chamber<00:01:22.049> mod<00:01:22.409> so<00:01:22.590> I<00:01:22.619> can't<00:01:22.920> complain

00:01:23.270 --> 00:01:23.280 
split chamber mod so I can't complain

00:01:23.280 --> 00:01:25.460 
split chamber mod so I can't complain

00:01:41.210 --> 00:01:41.220 
lucky it could be raged but the best

00:01:41.220 --> 00:01:42.830

method<00:01:41.369> for<00:01:41.729> getting<00:01:42.060> this<00:01:42.150> in<00:01:42.299> my<00:01:42.390> opinion<00:01:42.720> is

00:01:42.830 --> 00:01:42.840 
method for getting this in my opinion is

00:01:42.840 --> 00:01:44.600 
method for getting this in my opinion is
just<00:01:42.869> to<00:01:43.350> buy<00:01:43.530> it<00:01:43.590> this<00:01:43.890> thing<00:01:44.130> is<00:01:44.280> way<00:01:44.549> too

00:01:44.600 --> 00:01:44.610 
just to buy it this thing is way too

00:01:44.610 --> 00:01:47.420 
just to buy it this thing is way too
much<00:01:44.880> of<00:01:44.939> a<00:01:45.119> pain<00:01:45.329> to<00:01:46.110> actually<00:01:46.320> farm<00:01:46.920> or<00:01:47.220> get

00:01:47.420 --> 00:01:47.430 
much of a pain to actually farm or get

00:01:47.430 --> 00:01:48.980 
much of a pain to actually farm or get
through<00:01:47.700> legit<00:01:48.000> methods<00:01:48.390> so<00:01:48.479> I<00:01:48.509> recommend

00:01:48.980 --> 00:01:48.990 
through legit methods so I recommend

00:01:48.990 --> 00:01:50.330 
through legit methods so I recommend
finding<00:01:49.170> a<00:01:49.380> player<00:01:49.590> who's<00:01:49.799> selling<00:01:50.130> it<00:01:50.189> for

00:01:50.330 --> 00:01:50.340 
finding a player who's selling it for

00:01:50.340 --> 00:01:52.429 
finding a player who's selling it for
maybe<00:01:50.579> 15<00:01:50.970> or<00:01:51.180> 20<00:01:51.450> platinum<00:01:51.899> maybe<00:01:52.170> less<00:01:52.409> than

00:01:52.429 --> 00:01:52.439 
maybe 15 or 20 platinum maybe less than

00:01:52.439 --> 00:01:54.679 
maybe 15 or 20 platinum maybe less than
that<00:01:52.649> and<00:01:53.009> just<00:01:53.700> buy<00:01:53.850> it<00:01:53.909> from<00:01:54.180> them<00:01:54.329> I've<00:01:54.540> seen

00:01:54.679 --> 00:01:54.689 
that and just buy it from them I've seen

00:01:54.689 --> 00:01:55.999 
that and just buy it from them I've seen
some<00:01:54.840> people<00:01:54.930> sell<00:01:55.229> it<00:01:55.320> for<00:01:55.409> as<00:01:55.500> low<00:01:55.619> as<00:01:55.649> 5

00:01:55.999 --> 00:01:56.009 
some people sell it for as low as 5

00:01:56.009 --> 00:01:58.340 
some people sell it for as low as 5
actually<00:01:56.610> because<00:01:57.270> this<00:01:57.479> mod<00:01:57.689> is<00:01:57.899> just<00:01:58.140> not
