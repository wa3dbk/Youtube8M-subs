00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.450 

I<00:00:03.529> think<00:00:04.529> both<00:00:04.740> of<00:00:04.770> the<00:00:04.950> teams<00:00:05.160> came<00:00:05.310> out

00:00:05.450 --> 00:00:05.460 
I think both of the teams came out

00:00:05.460 --> 00:00:07.579 
I think both of the teams came out
prepared<00:00:05.819> and<00:00:05.970> ready<00:00:06.000> we<00:00:06.299> all<00:00:06.450> didn't<00:00:07.259> stop

00:00:07.579 --> 00:00:07.589 
prepared and ready we all didn't stop

00:00:07.589 --> 00:00:09.110 
prepared and ready we all didn't stop
until<00:00:07.620> the<00:00:08.040> final<00:00:08.340> whistle<00:00:08.370> blew<00:00:08.760> which<00:00:08.940> was<00:00:09.090> a

00:00:09.110 --> 00:00:09.120 
until the final whistle blew which was a

00:00:09.120 --> 00:00:11.150 
until the final whistle blew which was a
lot<00:00:09.420> of<00:00:09.450> fun<00:00:09.719> and<00:00:09.960> both<00:00:10.469> teams<00:00:10.710> just<00:00:10.950> like

00:00:11.150 --> 00:00:11.160 
lot of fun and both teams just like

00:00:11.160 --> 00:00:12.499 
lot of fun and both teams just like
really<00:00:11.400> gave<00:00:11.610> it<00:00:11.700> their<00:00:11.790> all<00:00:11.849> they<00:00:12.210> just<00:00:12.360> kept

00:00:12.499 --> 00:00:12.509 
really gave it their all they just kept

00:00:12.509 --> 00:00:14.780 
really gave it their all they just kept
coming<00:00:12.540> at<00:00:12.960> us<00:00:12.990> so<00:00:13.620> it<00:00:13.710> wasn't<00:00:13.860> just<00:00:14.160> like<00:00:14.490> we

00:00:14.780 --> 00:00:14.790 
coming at us so it wasn't just like we

00:00:14.790 --> 00:00:16.760 
coming at us so it wasn't just like we
scored<00:00:15.059> their<00:00:15.210> goals<00:00:15.420> and<00:00:15.540> ridanis<00:00:15.900> they<00:00:16.560> kept

00:00:16.760 --> 00:00:16.770 
scored their goals and ridanis they kept

00:00:16.770 --> 00:00:18.140 
scored their goals and ridanis they kept
coming<00:00:16.920> at<00:00:17.190> us<00:00:17.220> and<00:00:17.400> coming<00:00:17.670> at<00:00:17.789> us<00:00:17.820> and<00:00:18.029> we

00:00:18.140 --> 00:00:18.150 
coming at us and coming at us and we

00:00:18.150 --> 00:00:19.640 
coming at us and coming at us and we
still<00:00:18.300> had<00:00:18.420> to<00:00:18.510> play<00:00:18.690> our<00:00:18.810> game<00:00:18.960> and<00:00:19.140> I<00:00:19.289> think

00:00:19.640 --> 00:00:19.650 
still had to play our game and I think

00:00:19.650 --> 00:00:20.599 
still had to play our game and I think
we<00:00:19.740> played<00:00:19.890> well<00:00:20.039> and<00:00:20.160> especially<00:00:20.279> our

00:00:20.599 --> 00:00:20.609 
we played well and especially our

00:00:20.609 --> 00:00:22.400 
we played well and especially our
defense<00:00:21.000> they<00:00:21.600> just<00:00:21.779> took<00:00:21.900> care<00:00:21.960> of<00:00:22.140> it<00:00:22.289> back

00:00:22.400 --> 00:00:22.410 
defense they just took care of it back

00:00:22.410 --> 00:00:23.870 
defense they just took care of it back
there<00:00:22.590> too<00:00:22.740> it's<00:00:23.310> something<00:00:23.519> we've<00:00:23.850> been

00:00:23.870 --> 00:00:23.880 
there too it's something we've been

00:00:23.880 --> 00:00:26.029 
there too it's something we've been
stressing<00:00:24.480> for<00:00:24.510> about<00:00:25.080> the<00:00:25.380> last<00:00:25.410> five<00:00:25.800> months

00:00:26.029 --> 00:00:26.039 
stressing for about the last five months

00:00:26.039 --> 00:00:28.400 
stressing for about the last five months
is<00:00:26.369> that<00:00:26.699> pride<00:00:27.119> in<00:00:27.269> defending<00:00:27.750> us<00:00:27.869> a<00:00:27.900> team<00:00:28.199> and

00:00:28.400 --> 00:00:28.410 
is that pride in defending us a team and

00:00:28.410 --> 00:00:31.250 
is that pride in defending us a team and
limiting<00:00:29.400> other<00:00:29.609> team's<00:00:29.849> chances<00:00:30.330> and<00:00:31.140> I

00:00:31.250 --> 00:00:31.260 
limiting other team's chances and I

00:00:31.260 --> 00:00:32.630

of equality of mexico and europe three
nothing<00:01:38.689> it<00:01:39.689> helps<00:01:39.930> going<00:01:40.110> into<00:01:40.320> the<00:01:40.380> locker

00:01:40.490 --> 00:01:40.500 
nothing it helps going into the locker

00:01:40.500 --> 00:01:42.710 
nothing it helps going into the locker
room<00:01:40.650> and<00:01:40.950> it's<00:01:41.460> just<00:01:41.700> now<00:01:41.820> fine-tuning<00:01:42.600> a

00:01:42.710 --> 00:01:42.720 
room and it's just now fine-tuning a

00:01:42.720 --> 00:01:44.149 
room and it's just now fine-tuning a
couple<00:01:42.990> of<00:01:43.049> things<00:01:43.229> and<00:01:43.439> making<00:01:43.649> sure<00:01:43.920> that

00:01:44.149 --> 00:01:44.159 
couple of things and making sure that

00:01:44.159 --> 00:01:46.580 
couple of things and making sure that
where<00:01:45.030> we<00:01:45.420> stay<00:01:45.600> sharp<00:01:45.930> in<00:01:45.990> the<00:01:46.079> second<00:01:46.409> half

00:01:46.580 --> 00:01:46.590 
where we stay sharp in the second half

00:01:46.590 --> 00:01:48.760 
where we stay sharp in the second half
and<00:01:46.829> limit<00:01:47.399> their<00:01:47.549> chances<00:01:47.909> as<00:01:48.090> we<00:01:48.149> did

00:01:48.760 --> 00:01:48.770 
and limit their chances as we did

00:01:48.770 --> 00:01:50.960 
and limit their chances as we did
although<00:01:49.770> i<00:01:50.130> think<00:01:50.189> we<00:01:50.460> could<00:01:50.579> have<00:01:50.640> done<00:01:50.909> a

00:01:50.960 --> 00:01:50.970 
although i think we could have done a

00:01:50.970 --> 00:01:52.249 
although i think we could have done a
little<00:01:51.060> bit<00:01:51.210> better<00:01:51.360> job<00:01:51.659> keeping<00:01:51.840> the<00:01:52.110> ball

00:01:52.249 --> 00:01:52.259 
little bit better job keeping the ball

00:01:52.259 --> 00:01:54.830 
little bit better job keeping the ball
so<00:01:52.590> we<00:01:52.710> didn't<00:01:52.920> run<00:01:53.310> as<00:01:53.340> much<00:01:53.610> but<00:01:53.909> no<00:01:54.630> well

00:01:54.830 --> 00:01:54.840 
so we didn't run as much but no well

00:01:54.840 --> 00:01:56.240 
so we didn't run as much but no well
there's<00:01:55.439> always<00:01:55.619> something<00:01:55.920> to<00:01:56.009> work<00:01:56.130> on

00:01:56.240 --> 00:01:56.250 
there's always something to work on

00:01:56.250 --> 00:01:57.950 
there's always something to work on
