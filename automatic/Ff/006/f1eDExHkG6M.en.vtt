want any two snowflakes to be alike all

00:00:29.849 --> 00:00:31.970 
want any two snowflakes to be alike all
different<00:00:30.630> so<00:00:31.199> here's<00:00:31.410> some<00:00:31.560> different<00:00:31.859> ways

00:00:31.970 --> 00:00:31.980 
different so here's some different ways

00:00:31.980 --> 00:00:34.760 
different so here's some different ways
that<00:00:32.189> you<00:00:32.219> can<00:00:32.430> do<00:00:32.579> that<00:00:32.780> this<00:00:33.780> starts<00:00:34.559> with<00:00:34.649> a

00:00:34.760 --> 00:00:34.770 
that you can do that this starts with a

00:00:34.770 --> 00:00:39.229 
that you can do that this starts with a
great<00:00:35.070> big<00:00:35.250> round<00:00:35.640> jewel<00:00:37.700> then<00:00:38.700> we're<00:00:39.090> going

00:00:39.229 --> 00:00:39.239 
great big round jewel then we're going

00:00:39.239 --> 00:00:45.889 
great big round jewel then we're going
to<00:00:39.390> add<00:00:39.540> some<00:00:40.110> little<00:00:40.920> tiny<00:00:41.420> square<00:00:42.420> ones<00:00:44.899> just

00:00:45.889 --> 00:00:45.899 
to add some little tiny square ones just

00:00:45.899 --> 00:00:58.510 
to add some little tiny square ones just
all<00:00:46.110> the<00:00:46.260> way<00:00:46.379> around

00:00:58.510 --> 00:00:58.520 

00:00:58.520 --> 00:01:04.780 

they're<00:00:59.520> tiddle<00:01:00.150> take<00:01:00.360> about<00:01:00.600> seven<00:01:01.200> little

00:01:04.780 --> 00:01:04.790 

00:01:04.790 --> 00:01:07.610 

jewels<00:01:05.790> and<00:01:06.180> we're<00:01:06.510> putting<00:01:06.690> them<00:01:06.990> on<00:01:07.260> an

00:01:07.610 --> 00:01:07.620 
jewels and we're putting them on an

00:01:07.620 --> 00:01:12.470 
jewels and we're putting them on an
angle<00:01:08.130> so<00:01:08.850> that<00:01:08.880> the<00:01:09.120> point<00:01:10.430> this<00:01:11.430> is<00:01:11.730> towards

00:01:12.470 --> 00:01:12.480 
angle so that the point this is towards

00:01:12.480 --> 00:01:16.880 
angle so that the point this is towards
the<00:01:12.840> big<00:01:13.310> circle<00:01:14.310> and<00:01:15.050> that<00:01:16.050> makes<00:01:16.290> one<00:01:16.620> type

00:01:16.880 --> 00:01:16.890 
the big circle and that makes one type

00:01:16.890 --> 00:01:20.420 
the big circle and that makes one type
of<00:01:16.920> jewel<00:01:17.330> one<00:01:18.330> type<00:01:18.540> of<00:01:18.570> snowflake<00:01:19.200> and<00:01:19.440> then

00:01:20.420 --> 00:01:20.430 
of jewel one type of snowflake and then

00:01:20.430 --> 00:01:29.150 
of jewel one type of snowflake and then
we<00:01:20.850> can<00:01:21.060> add<00:01:23.479> some<00:01:24.479> smaller<00:01:27.860> of<00:01:28.860> the

00:01:29.150 --> 00:01:29.160 
we can add some smaller of the

00:01:29.160 --> 00:01:36.800 
we can add some smaller of the
rectangular<00:01:29.880> whipped<00:01:30.509> angle<00:01:30.960> ones<00:01:35.750> all<00:01:36.750> the

00:01:36.800 --> 00:01:36.810 
rectangular whipped angle ones all the

00:01:36.810 --> 00:01:38.900 
rectangular whipped angle ones all the
way<00:01:37.320> around<00:01:37.470> to<00:01:37.860> make<00:01:38.190> a<00:01:38.220> cute<00:01:38.640> little

00:01:38.900 --> 00:01:38.910 
way around to make a cute little

00:01:38.910 --> 00:01:46.969 
way around to make a cute little
snowflake

00:01:46.969 --> 00:01:46.979 

00:01:46.979 --> 00:01:50.399 

you<00:01:47.979> could<00:01:48.159> also<00:01:48.310> do<00:01:48.670> it<00:01:48.700> with<00:01:49.229> the<00:01:50.229> bigger

00:01:50.399 --> 00:01:50.409 
you could also do it with the bigger

00:01:50.409 --> 00:01:57.899 
you could also do it with the bigger
ones<00:01:51.479> to<00:01:52.479> make<00:01:52.659> a<00:01:52.689> bigger<00:01:52.930> snowflake<00:01:56.909> great

00:01:57.899 --> 00:01:57.909 
ones to make a bigger snowflake great

00:01:57.909 --> 00:02:02.100 
ones to make a bigger snowflake great
big<00:01:58.119> souffle<00:01:58.439> and<00:02:00.450> that's<00:02:01.450> how<00:02:01.630> you<00:02:01.690> can<00:02:01.960> make

00:02:02.100 --> 00:02:02.110 
big souffle and that's how you can make

00:02:02.110 --> 00:02:05.730 
big souffle and that's how you can make
your<00:02:02.320> snowflake<00:02:03.600> snowflakes<00:02:04.600> with<00:02:04.899> the

00:02:05.730 --> 00:02:05.740 
your snowflake snowflakes with the

00:02:05.740 --> 00:02:07.979 
your snowflake snowflakes with the
jewels
