00:00:08.700 --> 00:00:13.170
 and seriously I think it would be the factor 

00:00:11.160 --> 00:00:15.750
 main is to say seriousness and 

00:00:13.170 --> 00:00:18.090
 experience there are projects that you can 

00:00:15.750 --> 00:00:19.980
 go to request funding as a 

00:00:18.090 --> 00:00:22.439
 Mass that I really do not experience 

00:00:19.980 --> 00:00:24.330
 they ask but do go to a project with a 

00:00:22.439 --> 00:00:25.169
 business angelo capital risk the 

00:00:24.330 --> 00:00:28.529
 experience is an important degree 

00:00:25.169 --> 00:00:31.529
 when I think you have to contribute and 

00:00:28.529 --> 00:00:33.600
 then on the other hand seriousness is to say 

00:00:31.529 --> 00:00:35.940
 end a venture capital a business 

00:00:33.600 --> 00:00:37.739
 angels are playing their money and 

00:00:35.940 --> 00:00:41.850
 you have to be tremendously respectful 

00:00:37.739 --> 00:00:46.970
 with that in the end that money that company 

00:00:41.850 --> 00:00:49.829
 You can not lose if you raise the 

00:00:46.970 --> 00:00:53.010
 business based on that premise 

00:00:49.829 --> 00:00:55.530
 ok and you're the one respectful with the plan 

00:00:53.010 --> 00:00:58.110
 business how do you approach the subject and knowing 

00:00:55.530 --> 00:01:00.300
 that is not that not all the money 

00:00:58.110 --> 00:01:01.230
 that you are going to invest is your own and that 

00:01:00.300 --> 00:01:03.420
 therefore you have to have that 

00:01:01.230 --> 00:01:05.009
 seriousness to watch well for him because I 

00:01:03.420 --> 00:01:08.790
 I think that's a pretty step 

00:01:05.009 --> 00:01:11.040
 important if you focus and also be the 

00:01:08.790 --> 00:01:13.229
 focus and focus you know that this is not 

00:01:11.040 --> 00:01:14.880
 because I have a right this subject of 

00:01:13.229 --> 00:01:16.500
 it's going to be a great idea and 

00:01:14.880 --> 00:01:19.320
 allowing them to enter my business 

00:01:16.500 --> 00:01:21.270
 I think that lands in the 

00:01:19.320 --> 00:01:23.820
 approach because ideas like yours at 

00:01:21.270 --> 00:01:25.799
 you better have 20 entrepreneurs 

00:01:23.820 --> 00:01:28.200
 different in different fields that what 

00:01:25.799 --> 00:01:30.390
 is posing worth and really at 

00:01:28.200 --> 00:01:32.340
 final if you want and you need 

00:01:30.390 --> 00:01:34.229
 funding for your project have you 

00:01:32.340 --> 00:01:35.789
 Regarding the end, who are you going to 

00:01:34.229 --> 00:01:37.649
 ask as I tell you the money because at 

00:01:35.789 --> 00:01:40.079
 final is asking you to take a chance 

00:01:37.649 --> 00:01:41.570
 your money on something that can go well or 

00:01:40.079 --> 00:01:43.450
 it can go wrong 

00:01:41.570 --> 00:01:45.950
 Have an open mind 

00:01:43.450 --> 00:01:47.570
 flexibility and that the experience we 

00:01:45.950 --> 00:01:49.430
 says that the larger projects 

00:01:47.570 --> 00:01:51.200
 have become here in the case of 

00:01:49.430 --> 00:01:53.660
 Spain and in other countries have been the 

00:01:51.200 --> 00:01:56.420
 that have been shared if we are facing a 

00:01:53.660 --> 00:01:57.740
 entrepreneur who seeks to always have 

00:01:56.420 --> 00:02:00.380
 every cost one hundred percent of your 

00:01:57.740 --> 00:02:02.600
 project develop it as unique 

00:02:00.380 --> 00:02:03.950
 management person for that project 

00:02:02.600 --> 00:02:05.360
 will have certain limitations 

00:02:03.950 --> 00:02:07.420
 limitations that your capacity has that 

00:02:05.360 --> 00:02:10.070
 in many cases it may be 

00:02:07.420 --> 00:02:11.300
 extraordinary but that process of 

00:02:10.070 --> 00:02:14.360
 approach in reverse two has to 

00:02:11.300 --> 00:02:15.590
 look good faith and understand it as a 

00:02:14.360 --> 00:02:18.320
 person who is going to be inside the 

00:02:15.590 --> 00:02:19.670
 company and will help there is union of 

00:02:18.320 --> 00:02:21.709
 objectives is going to help the 

00:02:19.670 --> 00:02:23.300
 company grow because its goal 

00:02:21.709 --> 00:02:24.830
 it is also that the company grows there is no 

00:02:23.300 --> 00:02:27.770
 to see her as an external agent but 

00:02:24.830 --> 00:02:31.640
 as as one as a facilitating agent 

00:02:27.770 --> 00:02:34.230
 and as an agent that can make that 

00:02:31.640 --> 00:02:36.180
 project go better ended than without it 

00:02:34.230 --> 00:02:38.849
 what's happening right now there's 

00:02:36.180 --> 00:02:39.680
 many projects on the street and all 

00:02:38.849 --> 00:02:42.599
 they do not meet the requirements 

00:02:39.680 --> 00:02:44.459
 requirements in many terms of 

00:02:42.599 --> 00:02:47.400
 definition of the business idea is not 

00:02:44.459 --> 00:02:49.170
 has researched the market well the team 

00:02:47.400 --> 00:02:50.519
 is not complete and if we go in those 

00:02:49.170 --> 00:02:52.230
 conditions to request financing 

00:02:50.519 --> 00:02:54.560
 we have to take into account who 

00:02:52.230 --> 00:02:57.420
 we have the other side of the table 

00:02:54.560 --> 00:02:59.069
 we buy the rider not the horse say 

00:02:57.420 --> 00:03:01.349
 bought above all the entrepreneur is 

00:02:59.069 --> 00:03:03.690
 say a good idea in the hands 

00:03:01.349 --> 00:03:05.159
 wrong does not give us anything so 

00:03:03.690 --> 00:03:08.310
 So it is fundamental to know the 

00:03:05.159 --> 00:03:10.590
 entrepreneurs to meet with them and how 

00:03:08.310 --> 00:03:12.780
 what the council is made up of people 

00:03:10.590 --> 00:03:15.540
 most days with a lot of experience 

00:03:12.780 --> 00:03:18.299
 business since many from a simple 

00:03:15.540 --> 00:03:21.510
 one - hour meeting brings out 

00:03:18.299 --> 00:03:25.440
 enough conclusions all and already fits 

00:03:21.510 --> 00:03:28.170
 we enter a phase of analysis a lot 

00:03:25.440 --> 00:03:30.299
 more detailed business plan if 

00:03:28.170 --> 00:03:33.450
 somehow seen the plan 

00:03:30.299 --> 00:03:34.920
 business responds a little to what has been 

00:03:33.450 --> 00:03:37.739
 understood in the executive summary 

00:03:34.920 --> 00:03:40.230
 in parallel we started to negotiate with the 

00:03:37.739 --> 00:03:42.950
 entrepreneurs what is the part already more 

00:03:40.230 --> 00:03:45.209
 formal is the amount of investment 

00:03:42.950 --> 00:03:47.760
 what we do the investment agreement 

00:03:45.209 --> 00:03:49.500
 which is usually a general agreement where 

00:03:47.760 --> 00:03:52.829
 we say let's say the guidelines of the 

00:03:49.500 --> 00:03:54.930
 relationship is also established in that 

00:03:52.829 --> 00:03:56.700
 phase or a little later 

00:03:54.930 --> 00:03:58.590
 what are going to be the pacts of 

00:03:56.700 --> 00:04:01.500
 shareholders that is something very important 

00:03:58.590 --> 00:04:03.930
 in this type of relationship therefore in 

00:04:01.500 --> 00:04:06.720
 parallel we finished seeing that from the 

00:04:03.930 --> 00:04:08.940
 point of view of company that responds to 

00:04:06.720 --> 00:04:12.599
 what is the advice have been had since 

00:04:08.940 --> 00:04:14.430
 parallel business negotiate let's say all 

00:04:12.599 --> 00:04:17.340
 the elements so that already once 

00:04:14.430 --> 00:04:19.169
 we have everything closed and negotiated back 

00:04:17.340 --> 00:04:23.570
 to present it to the council let's say with 

00:04:19.169 --> 00:04:23.570
 the proposed operation to sign
