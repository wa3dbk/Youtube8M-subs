00:00:02.570 --> 00:00:07.790
 Zarechensky sausage and gilded on 

00:00:05.670 --> 00:00:07.790
 alder 

00:00:29.620 --> 00:00:34.970
 making a washing machine process 

00:00:32.420 --> 00:00:37.489
 long and multi-step at the beginning on 

00:00:34.970 --> 00:00:40.130
 enterprises in huge extruders 

00:00:37.489 --> 00:00:42.950
 all plastic machine parts are cast 

00:00:40.130 --> 00:00:45.920
 and then using a special machine 

00:00:42.950 --> 00:00:49.070
 stainless stealth plates are cut down 

00:00:45.920 --> 00:00:53.890
 Kiza roller mill drum after 

00:00:49.070 --> 00:00:53.890
 what begins the assembly stage 

00:00:56.940 --> 00:01:01.920
 incomprehensible to the mind but in just one shift 

00:00:59.160 --> 00:01:03.059
 about a thousand are going to the enterprise 

00:01:01.920 --> 00:01:05.220
 washing machines 

00:01:03.059 --> 00:01:07.710
 and hail to create each one 

00:01:05.220 --> 00:01:09.780
 includes about a hundred different 

00:01:07.710 --> 00:01:12.479
 assembly stages after 

00:01:09.780 --> 00:01:15.210
 manufactured drum it is installed 

00:01:12.479 --> 00:01:18.810
 in the back of the washing machine tank 

00:01:15.210 --> 00:01:20.610
 then this part is inserted ten which 

00:01:18.810 --> 00:01:21.210
 the consequences will warm the water for 

00:01:20.610 --> 00:01:23.670
 washing 

00:01:21.210 --> 00:01:26.310
 and then the back of the tank connects to 

00:01:23.670 --> 00:01:28.259
 the front part of the battle with screws on this 

00:01:26.310 --> 00:01:30.630
 washing unit is set upper 

00:01:28.259 --> 00:01:32.659
 counterweight which will scrape 

00:01:30.630 --> 00:01:36.179
 washing vibration 

00:01:32.659 --> 00:01:40.399
 then set the drive pulley motor 

00:01:36.179 --> 00:01:43.409
 and the motor is connected to the pulley belt 

00:01:40.399 --> 00:01:46.319
 after installing the heart and washing 

00:01:43.409 --> 00:01:49.020
 cars and and the case box is inserted 

00:01:46.319 --> 00:01:50.580
 for powder and the device is equipped 

00:01:49.020 --> 00:01:52.800
 a set of wires 

00:01:50.580 --> 00:01:55.140
 which connects the electronic card 

00:01:52.800 --> 00:01:58.500
 responsible for automatic tuning 

00:01:55.140 --> 00:02:00.720
 washing mode with all electrified 

00:01:58.500 --> 00:02:03.060
 details of the device after this 

00:02:00.720 --> 00:02:06.629
 washing machine operations close 

00:02:03.060 --> 00:02:10.220
 top lid and start the lab 

00:02:06.629 --> 00:02:10.220
 product testing 

00:02:12.319 --> 00:02:16.579
 when the washing machine is full 

00:02:14.510 --> 00:02:18.680
 assembled that is , the main nodes are already 

00:02:16.579 --> 00:02:21.260
 ready we carry out the so-called 

00:02:18.680 --> 00:02:23.269
 functional test functionally weave 

00:02:21.260 --> 00:02:25.719
 all the main characteristics 

00:02:23.269 --> 00:02:28.519
 that is, the robot controls the amount 

00:02:25.719 --> 00:02:31.489
 incoming water at what rate 

00:02:28.519 --> 00:02:33.769
 the amount is heated this gail is not how 

00:02:31.489 --> 00:02:35.150
 the way rotation happens i.e. 

00:02:33.769 --> 00:02:37.969
 controls all major functions 

00:02:35.150 --> 00:02:40.340
 washing machine one hundred percent on this 

00:02:37.969 --> 00:02:42.829
 the latest equipment is being tested 

00:02:40.340 --> 00:02:44.810
 all or service if washing machine 

00:02:42.829 --> 00:02:47.750
 deviates a little from the given 

00:02:44.810 --> 00:02:50.629
 qualities that the robot fixes it 

00:02:47.750 --> 00:02:52.219
 and it goes necessarily that percent on 

00:02:50.629 --> 00:02:53.750
 repair after repair 

00:02:52.219 --> 00:02:55.310
 he returns to it again 

00:02:53.750 --> 00:02:57.079
 functional test and only 

00:02:55.310 --> 00:03:00.609
 100% quality washing 

00:02:57.079 --> 00:03:00.609
 cars passes on 

00:03:03.130 --> 00:03:08.380
 all information about the passage of the patent 

00:03:05.590 --> 00:03:10.900
 and you ashy fixed by computers 

00:03:08.380 --> 00:03:13.960
 which stores in its memory the story 

00:03:10.900 --> 00:03:16.330
 building millions of machines understand these 

00:03:13.960 --> 00:03:18.520
 tests on the assembly line technology 

00:03:16.330 --> 00:03:20.710
 enterprises arrange selective 

00:03:18.520 --> 00:03:26.130
 checking chiral machines for each party 

00:03:20.710 --> 00:03:26.130
 furnaces god transports them to the lab 

00:03:33.330 --> 00:03:38.440
 here we check clean first 

00:03:36.010 --> 00:03:40.690
 aesthetic check buttons check 

00:03:38.440 --> 00:03:43.000
 handles check the door hi inside 

00:03:40.690 --> 00:03:44.890
 the drum also open the top cover and 

00:03:43.000 --> 00:03:47.349
 see if everything is ok mounted 

00:03:44.890 --> 00:03:49.390
 inside so that nothing bangs on 

00:03:47.349 --> 00:03:51.879
 did not disturb our customers at work 

00:03:49.390 --> 00:03:53.500
 after it is all checked it 

00:03:51.879 --> 00:03:56.410
 entered into a special form 

00:03:53.500 --> 00:03:57.989
 we turn on the audi system itself 

00:03:56.410 --> 00:04:00.750
 connected to the computer where then 

00:03:57.989 --> 00:04:03.790
 get the data we connect the thermocouple 

00:04:00.750 --> 00:04:05.890
 which measure the temperature further here 

00:04:03.790 --> 00:04:07.870
 rear is closer and who have the momentum 

00:04:05.890 --> 00:04:09.549
 that the machine gave out an accurate statement 

00:04:07.870 --> 00:04:11.470
 the number of turns is the same here 

00:04:09.549 --> 00:04:13.930
 there are special sensors that measure 

00:04:11.470 --> 00:04:17.169
 quantity and flow rate 

00:04:13.930 --> 00:04:19.750
 water and the car we run pour out there 

00:04:17.169 --> 00:04:21.669
 powder we start according to the program for 

00:04:19.750 --> 00:04:23.919
 maximum temperature is usually 

00:04:21.669 --> 00:04:25.270
 program number one and it erases the same 

00:04:23.919 --> 00:04:26.979
 washing without clothes 

00:04:25.270 --> 00:04:29.050
 since we have shipping 

00:04:26.979 --> 00:04:30.820
 screws and if your laundry machine would 

00:04:29.050 --> 00:04:32.260
 vibrated and we could exactly 

00:04:30.820 --> 00:04:35.289
 fix all these parameters 

00:04:32.260 --> 00:04:37.150
 when the car washes off it turns off 

00:04:35.289 --> 00:04:39.400
 and all data is transferred to 

00:04:37.150 --> 00:04:40.169
 we can turn on the computer see it 

00:04:39.400 --> 00:04:42.300
 all data 

00:04:40.169 --> 00:04:43.889
 that is, there you can see everything in detail every 

00:04:42.300 --> 00:04:46.289
 minute how much water 

00:04:43.889 --> 00:04:49.020
 what she did at that moment we see and 

00:04:46.289 --> 00:04:51.749
 table and graph and can analyze 

00:04:49.020 --> 00:04:54.509
 if the car issued a groove there we take it 

00:04:51.749 --> 00:04:56.340
 Pour again if the car for some 

00:04:54.509 --> 00:04:59.580
 reason did not give any of the parameters 

00:04:56.340 --> 00:05:01.499
 we analyze why it is 

00:04:59.580 --> 00:05:03.449
 are some human factors to blame 

00:05:01.499 --> 00:05:05.460
 a bit small between lasers and cars 

00:05:03.449 --> 00:05:07.289
 hit and turnover she won't then we 

00:05:05.460 --> 00:05:09.419
 run again and if it is 

00:05:07.289 --> 00:05:11.430
 For an objective reason, some pair you 

00:05:09.419 --> 00:05:13.979
 true to reality then we 

00:05:11.430 --> 00:05:15.990
 we analyze it and see why and we 

00:05:13.979 --> 00:05:18.810
 we make a special form of a stop 

00:05:15.990 --> 00:05:19.319
 There is never a shipment. 

00:05:18.810 --> 00:05:21.569
 shipped 

00:05:19.319 --> 00:05:22.469
 lot of washing machines in which there is 

00:05:21.569 --> 00:05:25.050
 some kind of problem 

00:05:22.469 --> 00:05:27.419
 we will definitely open and fix this 

00:05:25.050 --> 00:05:29.279
 the problem is only then removed 

00:05:27.419 --> 00:05:31.379
 special lock in our 

00:05:29.279 --> 00:05:34.430
 computer system and they can be 

00:05:31.379 --> 00:05:34.430
 filed on the lid 

00:05:42.320 --> 00:05:47.120
 all laboratory tests successfully passed 

00:05:44.780 --> 00:05:49.820
 automatic washing machines 

00:05:47.120 --> 00:05:52.310
 mode are sent to the packaging where 

00:05:49.820 --> 00:05:55.150
 assistance of an advanced robot to the product 

00:05:52.310 --> 00:05:58.750
 the cover and the pallet with a cardboard is put on 

00:05:55.150 --> 00:06:01.370
 anti-scratch on the case 

00:05:58.750 --> 00:06:03.770
 package will have time washing machines in 

00:06:01.370 --> 00:06:06.050
 auto wrap mode 

00:06:03.770 --> 00:06:11.800
 strong plastic film and 

00:06:06.050 --> 00:06:11.800
 head to the warehouse from there in stores 

00:06:14.950 --> 00:06:20.230
 who would not claim to foot the invention 

00:06:17.830 --> 00:06:23.080
 washing machine is the greatest 

00:06:20.230 --> 00:06:25.780
 discovery in the history of mankind about 

00:06:23.080 --> 00:06:28.690
 how exactly does it produce them today 

00:06:25.780 --> 00:06:33.840
 I could have just told everything 

00:06:28.690 --> 00:06:33.840
 now it's time to say goodbye dresses 

00:06:39.680 --> 00:06:42.680
 more
