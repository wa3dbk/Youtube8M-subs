00:00:00.319 --> 00:00:06.150
 Hello everyone, Iâ€™ve stayed in short 

00:00:03.600 --> 00:00:08.910
 a suburb of dallas town of some kind 

00:00:06.150 --> 00:00:12.380
 onstar in my opinion is called and decided 

00:00:08.910 --> 00:00:12.380
 shoot you a house in texas 

00:00:12.440 --> 00:00:18.960
 general texas in my fourth by 

00:00:16.949 --> 00:00:25.609
 the size of the world economy 

00:00:18.960 --> 00:00:31.619
 but here is one of the cheapest 

00:00:25.609 --> 00:00:34.739
 real estate in developed let's say 

00:00:31.619 --> 00:00:35.130
 areas of america and a house here you can buy 

00:00:34.739 --> 00:00:40.760
 Well 

00:00:35.130 --> 00:00:44.789
 probably two times cheaper than 

00:00:40.760 --> 00:00:47.160
 somewhere around New York 

00:00:44.789 --> 00:00:51.270
 Now there is a little rain I Shoot on 

00:00:47.160 --> 00:00:53.460
 go sandals and socks to be 

00:00:51.270 --> 00:00:57.960
 more convenient to enter a long year already wet 

00:00:53.460 --> 00:00:59.879
 legs so here in texas 

00:00:57.960 --> 00:01:01.649
 one of the cheapest does not breathe how much 

00:00:59.879 --> 00:01:03.120
 you can look at rifle and worth 

00:01:01.649 --> 00:01:05.549
 dot com for example and compare with him 

00:01:03.120 --> 00:01:06.540
 New York me at home certainly looks 

00:01:05.549 --> 00:01:10.170
 awesome 

00:01:06.540 --> 00:01:12.930
 Well, the area seems to be decent too, and 

00:01:10.170 --> 00:01:14.210
 there are a lot of my friends who are 

00:01:12.930 --> 00:01:16.320
 leaving new york 

00:01:14.210 --> 00:01:18.630
 it is in texas here buys 

00:01:16.320 --> 00:01:20.159
 real estate here seems to be like land 

00:01:18.630 --> 00:01:23.820
 can't buy here only at home because 

00:01:20.159 --> 00:01:25.439
 what near when you have to the capital but if i 

00:01:23.820 --> 00:01:27.750
 I want away the customs land myself 

00:01:25.439 --> 00:01:32.900
 buy anything the only minus 

00:01:27.750 --> 00:01:38.490
 Texas this summer generally fucking hot 

00:01:32.900 --> 00:01:40.439
 here and though there is no humidity like 

00:01:38.490 --> 00:01:43.829
 New York Well, damn it dawn schA such that 

00:01:40.439 --> 00:01:46.049
 tryndets but in any case not even 

00:01:43.829 --> 00:01:48.060
 breakdowns to the obtained and than by 

00:01:46.049 --> 00:01:50.700
 sensations than what he is Miami 

00:01:48.060 --> 00:01:52.649
 because miami is also humidity to spheres 

00:01:50.700 --> 00:01:55.060
 up is added it generally think 

00:01:52.649 --> 00:01:57.220

00:01:55.060 --> 00:02:00.899

00:01:57.220 --> 00:02:05.680
 sleeping area decent houses 

00:02:00.899 --> 00:02:09.039

00:02:13.330 --> 00:02:17.890
