other features here so you would

00:01:56.259 --> 00:02:01.289 
other features here so you would
brightness<00:01:56.619> controls<00:01:57.039> there<00:01:58.080> so<00:01:59.789> this<00:02:00.789> can

00:02:01.289 --> 00:02:01.299 
brightness controls there so this can

00:02:01.299 --> 00:02:03.289 
brightness controls there so this can
