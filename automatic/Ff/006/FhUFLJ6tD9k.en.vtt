00:00:28.929 --> 00:00:28.939 
May four months after the earthquake

00:00:28.939 --> 00:00:31.720 
May four months after the earthquake
actually<00:00:29.419> and<00:00:29.930> people<00:00:30.890> were<00:00:31.040> still<00:00:31.250> living<00:00:31.460> on

00:00:31.720 --> 00:00:31.730 
actually and people were still living on

00:00:31.730 --> 00:00:34.030 
actually and people were still living on
the<00:00:31.910> tents<00:00:32.270> the<00:00:32.689> other<00:00:32.809> thing<00:00:33.140> that<00:00:33.170> touch<00:00:33.770> me

00:00:34.030 --> 00:00:34.040 
the tents the other thing that touch me

00:00:34.040 --> 00:00:36.100 
the tents the other thing that touch me
and<00:00:34.160> was<00:00:34.340> shocking<00:00:34.790> to<00:00:34.820> me<00:00:35.329> was<00:00:35.510> how<00:00:36.050> many

00:00:36.100 --> 00:00:36.110 
and was shocking to me was how many

00:00:36.110 --> 00:00:38.380 
and was shocking to me was how many
buildings<00:00:37.010> have<00:00:37.219> collapsed<00:00:37.250> some<00:00:38.059> of<00:00:38.210> those

00:00:38.380 --> 00:00:38.390 
buildings have collapsed some of those

00:00:38.390 --> 00:00:40.690 
buildings have collapsed some of those
buildings<00:00:38.899> were<00:00:39.110> places<00:00:39.710> that<00:00:39.890> I<00:00:39.950> used<00:00:40.340> to<00:00:40.550> go

00:00:40.690 --> 00:00:40.700 
buildings were places that I used to go

00:00:40.700 --> 00:00:43.750 
buildings were places that I used to go
places<00:00:41.510> that<00:00:41.660> I<00:00:41.870> knew<00:00:42.530> movie<00:00:43.250> theaters

00:00:43.750 --> 00:00:43.760 
places that I knew movie theaters

00:00:43.760 --> 00:00:45.610 
places that I knew movie theaters
restaurants<00:00:43.789> the<00:00:44.750> place<00:00:44.989> where<00:00:45.200> I<00:00:45.230> was<00:00:45.410> living

00:00:45.610 --> 00:00:45.620 
restaurants the place where I was living

00:00:45.620 --> 00:00:48.520 
restaurants the place where I was living
have<00:00:46.160> lived<00:00:46.399> a<00:00:46.579> life<00:00:46.640> for<00:00:47.030> years<00:00:47.390> so<00:00:47.719> when<00:00:48.409> you

00:00:48.520 --> 00:00:48.530 
have lived a life for years so when you

00:00:48.530 --> 00:00:50.410 
have lived a life for years so when you
could<00:00:48.800> and<00:00:49.070> you<00:00:49.159> see<00:00:49.519> that<00:00:49.699> place<00:00:49.999> like<00:00:50.239> is

00:00:50.410 --> 00:00:50.420 
could and you see that place like is

00:00:50.420 --> 00:00:53.020 
could and you see that place like is
physically<00:00:51.050> gone<00:00:51.350> it's<00:00:52.010> like<00:00:52.249> some<00:00:52.670> of<00:00:52.819> those

00:00:53.020 --> 00:00:53.030 
physically gone it's like some of those

00:00:53.030 --> 00:00:56.889 
physically gone it's like some of those
memories<00:00:53.629> were<00:00:53.960> basically<00:00:54.440> wiped<00:00:54.859> away<00:00:55.899> at

00:00:56.889 --> 00:00:56.899 
memories were basically wiped away at

00:00:56.899 --> 00:00:59.439 
memories were basically wiped away at
the<00:00:57.319> time<00:00:57.710> the<00:00:58.159> earthquake<00:00:58.519> happened<00:00:58.760> there

00:00:59.439 --> 00:00:59.449 
the time the earthquake happened there

00:00:59.449 --> 00:01:01.930 
the time the earthquake happened there
was<00:00:59.569> no<00:00:59.749> construction<00:01:00.260> caught<00:01:01.159> and<00:01:01.370> forced

00:01:01.930 --> 00:01:01.940 
was no construction caught and forced

00:01:01.940 --> 00:01:03.309 
was no construction caught and forced
sometimes<00:01:02.600> you'll<00:01:02.749> just<00:01:02.780> go<00:01:03.170> on<00:01:03.289> a

00:01:03.309 --> 00:01:03.319 
sometimes you'll just go on a

00:01:03.319 --> 00:01:05.560 
sometimes you'll just go on a
construction<00:01:03.679> site<00:01:04.250> and<00:01:04.550> you'll<00:01:04.699> see<00:01:04.729> things

00:01:05.560 --> 00:01:05.570 
construction site and you'll see things

00:01:05.570 --> 00:01:08.080 
construction site and you'll see things
happening<00:01:06.380> that<00:01:06.710> just<00:01:07.520> calling<00:01:07.880> for

00:01:08.080 --> 00:01:08.090 
happening that just calling for

00:01:08.090 --> 00:01:09.820 
happening that just calling for
chalkboard<00:01:08.570> columns<00:01:08.990> there<00:01:09.229> would<00:01:09.590> not<00:01:09.770> be

00:01:09.820 --> 00:01:09.830 
chalkboard columns there would not be

00:01:09.830 --> 00:01:12.040 
chalkboard columns there would not be
straight<00:01:10.400> the<00:01:10.640> smell<00:01:10.909> of<00:01:10.940> the<00:01:11.270> Reba<00:01:11.630> will<00:01:11.840> not

00:01:12.040 --> 00:01:12.050 
straight the smell of the Reba will not

00:01:12.050 --> 00:01:15.250 
straight the smell of the Reba will not
be<00:01:12.290> the<00:01:12.770> proper<00:01:13.040> placement<00:01:13.460> in<00:01:14.180> a<00:01:14.330> sense<00:01:14.630> this

00:01:15.250 --> 00:01:15.260 
be the proper placement in a sense this

00:01:15.260 --> 00:01:17.170 
be the proper placement in a sense this
catastrophe<00:01:15.590> that<00:01:16.190> we<00:01:16.400> have<00:01:16.520> seen<00:01:16.820> could<00:01:17.000> have

00:01:17.170 --> 00:01:17.180 
catastrophe that we have seen could have

00:01:17.180 --> 00:01:18.100 
catastrophe that we have seen could have
been<00:01:17.390> prevented

00:01:18.100 --> 00:01:18.110 
been prevented

00:01:18.110 --> 00:01:20.080 
been prevented
at<00:01:18.320> that<00:01:18.530> time<00:01:18.770> you've<00:01:18.950> all<00:01:19.100> kind<00:01:19.460> of<00:01:19.550> try<00:01:19.880> not

00:01:20.080 --> 00:01:20.090 
at that time you've all kind of try not

00:01:20.090 --> 00:01:22.450 
at that time you've all kind of try not
to<00:01:20.240> find<00:01:20.450> someone<00:01:20.930> to<00:01:21.140> blame<00:01:21.290> but<00:01:21.710> after<00:01:22.100> some

00:01:22.450 --> 00:01:22.460 
to find someone to blame but after some

00:01:22.460 --> 00:01:25.060 
to find someone to blame but after some
time<00:01:22.760> I<00:01:23.030> started<00:01:23.450> to<00:01:23.510> think<00:01:23.840> okay<00:01:24.200> now<00:01:24.380> this

00:01:25.060 --> 00:01:25.070 
time I started to think okay now this

00:01:25.070 --> 00:01:27.160 
time I started to think okay now this
has<00:01:25.310> happened<00:01:25.550> and<00:01:26.000> it's<00:01:26.240> really<00:01:26.480> sad<00:01:26.750> that<00:01:26.960> so

00:01:27.160 --> 00:01:27.170 
has happened and it's really sad that so

00:01:27.170 --> 00:01:29.770 
has happened and it's really sad that so
many<00:01:27.200> people<00:01:27.770> lost<00:01:28.730> their<00:01:28.880> lives<00:01:29.210> but<00:01:29.540> what

00:01:29.770 --> 00:01:29.780 
many people lost their lives but what

00:01:29.780 --> 00:01:33.190 
many people lost their lives but what
can<00:01:30.050> I<00:01:30.170> do<00:01:30.530> now<00:01:31.270> MC<00:01:32.270> at<00:01:32.360> the<00:01:32.540> multidisciplinary

00:01:33.190 --> 00:01:33.200 
can I do now MC at the multidisciplinary

was<00:01:38.000> very<00:01:38.360> supportive<00:01:38.810> of<00:01:39.290> one<00:01:39.890> idea<00:01:40.070> that

00:01:40.540 --> 00:01:40.550 
was very supportive of one idea that

00:01:40.550 --> 00:01:43.120 
was very supportive of one idea that
came<00:01:40.760> up<00:01:40.970> of<00:01:41.210> training<00:01:41.690> engineers<00:01:42.470> from<00:01:42.740> Haiti

00:01:43.120 --> 00:01:43.130 
came up of training engineers from Haiti

00:01:43.130 --> 00:01:45.370 
came up of training engineers from Haiti
like<00:01:43.640> an<00:01:43.820> earthquake<00:01:44.000> engineering<00:01:44.360> I<00:01:45.020> have

00:01:45.370 --> 00:01:45.380 
like an earthquake engineering I have

00:01:45.380 --> 00:01:48.310 
like an earthquake engineering I have
been<00:01:45.650> participating<00:01:46.430> as<00:01:46.790> a<00:01:46.820> teacher<00:01:47.390> in<00:01:47.750> some

00:01:48.310 --> 00:01:48.320 
been participating as a teacher in some

00:01:48.320 --> 00:01:50.950 
been participating as a teacher in some
seminars<00:01:49.190> that<00:01:49.400> we<00:01:49.460> are<00:01:50.120> still<00:01:50.330> having<00:01:50.540> in<00:01:50.810> the

00:01:50.950 --> 00:01:50.960 
seminars that we are still having in the

00:01:50.960 --> 00:01:53.250 
seminars that we are still having in the
country<00:01:51.410> some<00:01:51.710> of<00:01:51.860> those<00:01:52.040> seminars<00:01:52.670> are<00:01:52.880> about

00:01:53.250 --> 00:01:53.260 
country some of those seminars are about

00:01:53.260 --> 00:01:55.630 
country some of those seminars are about
reinforce<00:01:54.260> concrete<00:01:54.560> about<00:01:55.220> wood

00:01:55.630 --> 00:01:55.640 
reinforce concrete about wood

00:01:55.640 --> 00:01:58.450 
reinforce concrete about wood
construction<00:01:56.030> and<00:01:56.900> about<00:01:57.440> soil<00:01:58.130> mechanics

00:01:58.450 --> 00:01:58.460 
construction and about soil mechanics

00:01:58.460 --> 00:02:01.090 
construction and about soil mechanics
the<00:01:59.030> basic<00:01:59.360> idea<00:01:59.750> is<00:01:59.840> that<00:01:59.960> put<00:02:00.350> together<00:02:00.530> all

00:02:01.090 --> 00:02:01.100 
the basic idea is that put together all

00:02:01.100 --> 00:02:03.490 
the basic idea is that put together all
of<00:02:01.280> those<00:02:01.430> seminars<00:02:01.970> can<00:02:02.330> give<00:02:02.660> the<00:02:02.960> engineers

00:02:03.490 --> 00:02:03.500 
of those seminars can give the engineers

00:02:03.500 --> 00:02:05.410 
of those seminars can give the engineers
back<00:02:03.740> home<00:02:04.070> the<00:02:04.460> tools<00:02:04.700> that<00:02:04.940> they<00:02:05.120> need<00:02:05.390> to

00:02:05.410 --> 00:02:05.420 
back home the tools that they need to

00:02:05.420 --> 00:02:07.600 
back home the tools that they need to
design<00:02:05.960> readings<00:02:06.410> that<00:02:06.530> are<00:02:06.710> safer<00:02:07.250> in<00:02:07.370> an

00:02:07.600 --> 00:02:07.610 
design readings that are safer in an

00:02:07.610 --> 00:02:08.870 
design readings that are safer in an
earthquake

00:02:08.870 --> 00:02:08.880 
earthquake

00:02:08.880 --> 00:02:10.700 
earthquake
I'm<00:02:09.480> very<00:02:09.870> happy<00:02:10.110> that<00:02:10.140> I<00:02:10.290> have<00:02:10.500> an

00:02:10.700 --> 00:02:10.710 
I'm very happy that I have an

00:02:10.710 --> 00:02:13.160 
I'm very happy that I have an
opportunity<00:02:11.070> to<00:02:11.700> put<00:02:11.910> to<00:02:12.090> use<00:02:12.360> things<00:02:12.930> that

00:02:13.160 --> 00:02:13.170 
opportunity to put to use things that

00:02:13.170 --> 00:02:14.780 
opportunity to put to use things that
I've<00:02:13.380> learned<00:02:13.680> and<00:02:13.920> at<00:02:14.100> the<00:02:14.220> same<00:02:14.460> time<00:02:14.640> that

00:02:14.780 --> 00:02:14.790 
I've learned and at the same time that

00:02:14.790 --> 00:02:17.960 
I've learned and at the same time that
I'm<00:02:14.970> serving<00:02:15.330> the<00:02:15.720> people<00:02:15.900> in<00:02:16.230> my<00:02:16.380> country<00:02:16.970> it

00:02:17.960 --> 00:02:17.970 
I'm serving the people in my country it

00:02:17.970 --> 00:02:20.450 
I'm serving the people in my country it
was<00:02:18.150> not<00:02:18.480> acceptable<00:02:19.260> that<00:02:19.560> so<00:02:19.860> many<00:02:20.040> people

00:02:20.450 --> 00:02:20.460 
was not acceptable that so many people

00:02:20.460 --> 00:02:24.440 
was not acceptable that so many people
died<00:02:20.820> in<00:02:21.330> such<00:02:22.170> horrible<00:02:22.620> conditions<00:02:22.800> and<00:02:23.730> my

00:02:24.440 --> 00:02:24.450 
died in such horrible conditions and my

00:02:24.450 --> 00:02:26.240 
died in such horrible conditions and my
hope<00:02:24.660> moving<00:02:25.290> forward<00:02:25.560> is<00:02:25.710> that<00:02:25.740> this<00:02:26.070> is

00:02:26.240 --> 00:02:26.250 
hope moving forward is that this is

00:02:26.250 --> 00:02:35.520 
hope moving forward is that this is
never<00:02:26.490> going<00:02:26.820> to<00:02:26.940> happen<00:02:27.150> again

00:02:35.520 --> 00:02:35.530
