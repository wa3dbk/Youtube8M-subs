00:02:40.480 --> 00:02:47.800
 oh and for that you only country if you were 

00:02:43.810 --> 00:02:49.630
 was the host the server owner 

00:02:47.800 --> 00:02:51.550
 You 'll always have to leave this program 

00:02:49.630 --> 00:02:56.500
 linked here you can close 

00:02:51.550 --> 00:02:57.520
 So you can call friends to 

00:02:56.500 --> 00:03:00.250
 play together 

00:02:57.520 --> 00:03:03.820
 You can not just do this, you gotta have it. 

00:03:00.250 --> 00:03:06.640
 hamachi I will leave the link to download and 

00:03:03.820 --> 00:03:08.710
 also in the description is to create a new 

00:03:06.640 --> 00:03:09.280
 network or between an existence of any 

00:03:08.710 --> 00:03:17.670
 one 

00:03:09.280 --> 00:03:17.670
 going to create a new mother network craft 

00:03:19.110 --> 00:03:33.930
 server 123 was the 18th 

00:03:35.640 --> 00:03:41.680
 there you will give the name and password to 

00:03:40.570 --> 00:03:47.400
 your friends 

00:03:41.680 --> 00:03:47.400
 they will put existing network 

00:04:09.060 --> 00:04:15.730
 multiplayer 

00:04:10.269 --> 00:04:20.109
 Then he is my brain, it's as standard. 

00:04:15.730 --> 00:04:22.630
 Then you'll go there and get the 

00:04:20.109 --> 00:04:28.420
 your own pp came only to the host 

00:04:22.630 --> 00:04:31.030
 go there copying the ipv4 address will serve the 

00:04:28.420 --> 00:04:36.880
 36 coca counted 

00:04:31.030 --> 00:04:41.130
 minecraft service and lol server 

00:04:36.880 --> 00:04:44.080
 so it's cool, it 's not connected because 

00:04:41.130 --> 00:04:47.070
 there is connected per month because you already have 

00:04:44.080 --> 00:04:50.920
 a letter goal that was an example is 

00:04:47.070 --> 00:04:54.100
 and you'll see the 

00:04:50.920 --> 00:04:58.330
 Now, your friends come in. 

00:04:54.100 --> 00:05:02.320
 they will do it here you go in 

00:04:58.330 --> 00:05:03.880
 direct connect closed and there it will appear 

00:05:02.320 --> 00:05:05.140
 the name of your friends, everything here I go 

00:05:03.880 --> 00:05:08.550
 trick 

00:05:05.140 --> 00:05:11.200
 I'll join the friendly region later. 

00:05:08.550 --> 00:05:15.340
 Let's suppose that I am a person who 

00:05:11.200 --> 00:05:21.370
 enter the server's someone there if rafa 

00:05:15.340 --> 00:05:23.320
 reveal the host I go on cope and pv them 

00:05:21.370 --> 00:05:28.480
 Let's copy it because we realize that 

00:05:23.320 --> 00:05:32.440
 the host is copying will tighten the 

00:05:28.480 --> 00:05:34.210
 problem came back against ov 

00:05:32.440 --> 00:05:36.880
 then you realize that here is the same 

00:05:34.210 --> 00:05:38.260
 I'm standing right here in case a wrong idea 

00:05:36.880 --> 00:05:41.410
 because he is not 

00:05:38.260 --> 00:05:43.180
 I liked nothing, it 's my friend, but it's okay 

00:05:41.410 --> 00:05:46.210
 if he had this program turned on 

00:05:43.180 --> 00:05:49.150
 and with ip all right 

00:05:46.210 --> 00:05:52.330
 The idea is right but it changes then it's just 

00:05:49.150 --> 00:05:55.960
 catch the impetus guy do it here in 

00:05:52.330 --> 00:05:58.840
 series will go wrong however it is because he 

00:05:55.960 --> 00:06:01.150
 It is not being routine but here my the 

00:05:58.840 --> 00:06:04.810
 miss a server your other person 

00:06:01.150 --> 00:06:07.570
 Just get my baby and put a direct 

00:06:04.810 --> 00:06:11.170
 connect that will connect everything right 

00:06:07.570 --> 00:06:12.790

00:06:18.700 --> 00:06:24.040
