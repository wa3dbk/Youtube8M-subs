00:00:12.019 --> 00:00:17.310
 how about my friend my name is Jorge and you 

00:00:14.580 --> 00:00:18.869
 you are in your channel apple bears review in 

00:00:17.310 --> 00:00:20.880
 this video I'm going to show you a tweet that 

00:00:18.869 --> 00:00:22.260
 it seemed to me very father who is called madness 

00:00:20.880 --> 00:00:24.359
 what is it that will allow us to do 

00:00:22.260 --> 00:00:27.090
 will allow us to block a 

00:00:24.359 --> 00:00:28.650
 native application or user with a 

00:00:27.090 --> 00:00:29.910
 password 

00:00:28.650 --> 00:00:32.850
 we just have to try 

00:00:29.910 --> 00:00:35.250
 access the application and it would appear 

00:00:32.850 --> 00:00:36.870
 a code to configure the application 

00:00:35.250 --> 00:00:38.219
 and show you how the code would look 

00:00:36.870 --> 00:00:41.129
 we would have to enter the application 

00:00:38.219 --> 00:00:42.690
 Once inside, it will allow us 

00:00:41.129 --> 00:00:45.600
 to ask the first time we do 

00:00:42.690 --> 00:00:48.210
 our password I chose this one that 

00:00:45.600 --> 00:00:51.059
 it would be a circle 

00:00:48.210 --> 00:00:53.730
 and ready will we and we will show a 

00:00:51.059 --> 00:00:55.739
 list of applications with which 

00:00:53.730 --> 00:00:58.470
 we would simply have to for example 

00:00:55.739 --> 00:01:01.019
 I'm going to choose what the calculator is 

00:00:58.470 --> 00:01:02.879
 that I have here activated I'm going to enter 

00:01:01.019 --> 00:01:05.550
 my sprint board and I'll look for the 

00:01:02.879 --> 00:01:08.340
 calculator and when trying to open the 

00:01:05.550 --> 00:01:10.409
 calculator is going to ask me for a code and 

00:01:08.340 --> 00:01:14.100
 as you can see if I enter the 

00:01:10.409 --> 00:01:16.680
 same code that I had introduced did not 

00:01:14.100 --> 00:01:18.840
 will let enter 

00:01:16.680 --> 00:01:21.149
 I put it again 

00:01:18.840 --> 00:01:22.619
 let's go into the calculator and 

00:01:21.149 --> 00:01:25.170
 let's hope he asks for the password 

00:01:22.619 --> 00:01:26.969
 this is something immediate I observed it 

00:01:25.170 --> 00:01:28.530
 reflected on the screen 

00:01:26.969 --> 00:01:31.439
 well you do not see them reflected because of me 

00:01:28.530 --> 00:01:33.930
 internet connection and let's try 

00:01:31.439 --> 00:01:36.210
 put a password 

00:01:33.930 --> 00:01:39.000
 and he's going to tell us it was a password 

00:01:36.210 --> 00:01:40.950
 wrong that is the first good mistake 

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:42.630
 to download this tweet if it's people 

00:01:40.950 --> 00:01:44.960
 interest or we would just have to go 

00:01:42.630 --> 00:01:49.860
 to civil and through that we are in sivia 

00:01:44.960 --> 00:01:52.020
 we would have to go to manage sources and 

00:01:49.860 --> 00:01:53.790
 we are going to add a repository that will 

00:01:52.020 --> 00:01:56.700
 it must be appearing at this moment 

00:01:53.790 --> 00:01:58.950
 which is this that I'm pointing to and 

00:01:56.700 --> 00:02:01.170
 now the repository should appear and 

00:01:58.950 --> 00:02:03.450
 twitter good name once 

00:02:01.170 --> 00:02:05.300
 we have it, we are going to look for it and 

00:02:03.450 --> 00:02:07.840
 we are going to write 

00:02:05.300 --> 00:02:07.840
 block 

00:02:08.360 --> 00:02:12.690
 as you can see I already have it installed 

00:02:10.710 --> 00:02:16.140
 It's a pay tweet too if you can 

00:02:12.690 --> 00:02:19.220
 pay and you want to pay it because they cost 

00:02:16.140 --> 00:02:22.080
 I think it's three dollars and three dollars 

00:02:19.220 --> 00:02:23.340
 and you will not have any problem and what 

00:02:22.080 --> 00:02:25.650
 You can install in all 

00:02:23.340 --> 00:02:28.230
 devices you want 

00:02:25.650 --> 00:02:30.629
 For my part this would be all my next 

00:02:28.230 --> 00:02:33.540
 video is going to be a top 5 clicks for the 

00:02:30.629 --> 00:02:36.799
 phone and I hope you like them I'm not 

00:02:33.540 --> 00:02:36.799
 I see you in the next video
