00:01:25.850 --> 00:01:28.720
 of the game 

00:01:36.659 --> 00:01:41.600

 emilia note that everyone is 

00:01:45.650 --> 00:01:51.909
 excited but the theme is the emilia 

00:01:48.780 --> 00:01:55.509
 to see look at my family 

00:01:51.909 --> 00:01:59.069
 I am very emotional but not clear that this 

00:01:55.509 --> 00:02:02.289
 it's like the game is a lot of people 

00:01:59.069 --> 00:02:05.159
 I have more daughter I have tears you have 

00:02:02.289 --> 00:02:05.159

00:02:09.299 --> 00:02:14.980
 I was crying good but it is not 

00:02:13.060 --> 00:02:18.190
 question but wait if it's not the 

00:02:14.980 --> 00:02:20.680
 emotion because you just saw that 

00:02:18.190 --> 00:02:27.580
 there they tell me the castrillon tear to the 

00:02:20.680 --> 00:02:31.860
 tears tears tears crisis 

00:02:27.580 --> 00:02:31.860
 that is to look like a blue eye 

00:02:32.870 --> 00:02:35.560
 and good 

00:02:35.790 --> 00:02:44.310
 the tear is removed 

00:02:39.510 --> 00:02:44.310
 yes production that I 

00:02:49.360 --> 00:03:05.780
 I do not have tears in my eyes if the 

00:02:58.870 --> 00:03:09.470
 rule of the game 'to cover the matter is 

00:03:05.780 --> 00:03:11.569
 the emotion of the actors for example 

00:03:09.470 --> 00:03:13.700
 that are thrilled in one in a scene 

00:03:11.569 --> 00:03:15.859
 Well just like the game alludes 

00:03:13.700 --> 00:03:19.400
 to that to find the emotion that we walk 

00:03:15.859 --> 00:03:21.109
 looking for laughter is also good 

00:03:19.400 --> 00:03:23.690
 find the emotion you think that what 

00:03:21.109 --> 00:03:25.040
 it's good to look for laughter and it's very 

00:03:23.690 --> 00:03:26.750
 well look for laughter but it's also 

00:03:25.040 --> 00:03:29.150
 well as looking for emotions as a 

00:03:26.750 --> 00:03:30.859
 exercise explores the feelings and the 

00:03:29.150 --> 00:03:33.230
 crying is one thing that I think nobody 

00:03:30.859 --> 00:03:38.980
 doubt that it is good that it is a good thing 

00:03:33.230 --> 00:03:44.959
 or not the logical announcer crying if you and 

00:03:38.980 --> 00:03:46.549
 I feel bad at the time but 

00:03:44.959 --> 00:03:48.139
 then it 's like it makes you take out the 

00:03:46.549 --> 00:03:50.090
 tear guido was coming look at me 

00:03:48.139 --> 00:03:53.050
