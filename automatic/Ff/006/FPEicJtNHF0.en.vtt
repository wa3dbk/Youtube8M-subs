00:02:29.360 --> 00:02:29.370 
that water in the planet is clean and

00:02:29.370 --> 00:02:32.930 
that water in the planet is clean and
drinkable<00:02:30.739> three<00:02:31.739> percent<00:02:32.070> it's<00:02:32.250> fresh<00:02:32.550> but<00:02:32.910> a

00:02:32.930 --> 00:02:32.940 
drinkable three percent it's fresh but a

00:02:32.940 --> 00:02:35.810 
drinkable three percent it's fresh but a
lot<00:02:33.180> of<00:02:33.239> it<00:02:33.420> is<00:02:33.540> contaminated<00:02:34.410> dirty<00:02:34.830> full<00:02:35.670> of

disease and not drinkable and kids are

00:02:38.370 --> 00:02:41.360 
disease and not drinkable and kids are
dying<00:02:38.610> every<00:02:38.850> day<00:02:39.650> just<00:02:40.650> from<00:02:40.769> drinking<00:02:40.980> this

00:02:41.360 --> 00:02:41.370 
dying every day just from drinking this

00:02:41.370 --> 00:02:43.940 
dying every day just from drinking this
dirty<00:02:41.670> water<00:02:42.000> now<00:02:42.660> i<00:02:42.989> also<00:02:43.530> want<00:02:43.830> to<00:02:43.890> mention

00:02:43.940 --> 00:02:43.950 
dirty water now i also want to mention

00:02:43.950 --> 00:02:46.970 
dirty water now i also want to mention
that<00:02:44.400> so<00:02:45.330> much<00:02:45.570> time<00:02:45.930> is<00:02:46.320> spent<00:02:46.350> collecting

00:02:46.970 --> 00:02:46.980 
that so much time is spent collecting

00:02:46.980 --> 00:02:49.670 
that so much time is spent collecting
water<00:02:47.610> that's<00:02:48.000> usually<00:02:48.570> dirty<00:02:49.200> i<00:02:49.320> mean<00:02:49.590> these

00:02:49.670 --> 00:02:49.680 
water that's usually dirty i mean these

00:02:49.680 --> 00:02:51.770 
water that's usually dirty i mean these
communities<00:02:50.190> have<00:02:50.370> to<00:02:50.519> travel<00:02:50.760> far<00:02:51.150> distances

00:02:51.770 --> 00:02:51.780 
communities have to travel far distances

00:02:51.780 --> 00:02:53.270 
communities have to travel far distances
they<00:02:51.930> have<00:02:52.019> to<00:02:52.110> walk<00:02:52.320> for<00:02:52.560> hours<00:02:52.739> and<00:02:53.160> hours

00:02:53.270 --> 00:02:53.280 
they have to walk for hours and hours

00:02:53.280 --> 00:02:55.970 
they have to walk for hours and hours
collecting<00:02:54.180> this<00:02:54.690> water<00:02:54.989> for<00:02:55.380> their<00:02:55.530> families

00:02:55.970 --> 00:02:55.980 
collecting this water for their families

00:02:55.980 --> 00:03:00.470 
collecting this water for their families
and<00:02:57.950> much<00:02:58.950> of<00:02:58.980> its<00:02:59.280> dirty<00:02:59.549> contaminated<00:03:00.329> and

00:03:00.470 --> 00:03:00.480 
and much of its dirty contaminated and

00:03:00.480 --> 00:03:03.020 
and much of its dirty contaminated and
it's<00:03:00.840> usually<00:03:01.230> women<00:03:01.440> and<00:03:01.680> children<00:03:02.100> so<00:03:02.640> this

00:03:03.020 --> 00:03:03.030 
it's usually women and children so this

00:03:03.030 --> 00:03:05.030 
it's usually women and children so this
takes<00:03:03.269> away<00:03:03.480> the<00:03:03.750> time<00:03:03.959> that<00:03:04.320> children<00:03:04.920> could

00:03:05.030 --> 00:03:05.040 
takes away the time that children could

00:03:05.040 --> 00:03:07.430 
takes away the time that children could
be<00:03:05.100> spending<00:03:05.519> learning<00:03:06.120> in<00:03:06.329> school<00:03:06.690> they're

00:03:07.430 --> 00:03:07.440 
be spending learning in school they're

00:03:07.440 --> 00:03:09.199 
be spending learning in school they're
spending<00:03:08.010> time<00:03:08.190> collecting<00:03:08.640> water<00:03:08.790> when<00:03:09.090> they

00:03:09.199 --> 00:03:09.209 
spending time collecting water when they

00:03:09.209 --> 00:03:11.720 
spending time collecting water when they
could<00:03:09.840> be<00:03:09.989> going<00:03:10.200> to<00:03:10.290> school<00:03:10.410> and<00:03:10.799> many<00:03:11.430> could

so it's it's amazing how water really
does<00:03:25.530> boil<00:03:25.920> down<00:03:26.040> to<00:03:26.299> everything<00:03:27.299> water<00:03:28.049> is

00:03:28.360 --> 00:03:28.370 
does boil down to everything water is

or<00:03:53.730> aquata<00:03:54.180> geoya<00:03:54.830> make<00:03:55.830> sure<00:03:55.980> it's<00:03:56.100> the

00:03:56.120 --> 00:03:56.130 
or aquata geoya make sure it's the

00:03:56.130 --> 00:03:59.330 
or aquata geoya make sure it's the
bottles<00:03:56.550> with<00:03:56.790> the<00:03:56.940> aquifer<00:03:57.510> life<00:03:57.690> on<00:03:58.260> it<00:03:58.740> they

00:03:59.330 --> 00:03:59.340 
bottles with the aquifer life on it they

00:03:59.340 --> 00:04:01.520 
bottles with the aquifer life on it they
will<00:03:59.640> provide<00:04:00.000> a<00:04:00.030> hundred<00:04:00.540> liters<00:04:00.750> so

00:04:01.520 --> 00:04:01.530 
will provide a hundred liters so

00:04:01.530 --> 00:04:02.690 
will provide a hundred liters so
basically<00:04:01.770> i'll<00:04:01.890> provide<00:04:02.070> the<00:04:02.280> funds<00:04:02.550> to

00:04:02.690 --> 00:04:02.700 
basically i'll provide the funds to

00:04:02.700 --> 00:04:04.940 
basically i'll provide the funds to
Green<00:04:03.030> Cross<00:04:03.330> which<00:04:03.720> is<00:04:04.020> the<00:04:04.380> equivalent<00:04:04.500> to

00:04:04.940 --> 00:04:04.950 
Green Cross which is the equivalent to

00:04:04.950 --> 00:04:07.490 
Green Cross which is the equivalent to
100<00:04:05.400> liters<00:04:05.670> of<00:04:05.850> clean<00:04:06.210> safe<00:04:07.020> drinking<00:04:07.050> water

00:04:07.490 --> 00:04:07.500 
100 liters of clean safe drinking water

00:04:07.500 --> 00:04:09.920 
100 liters of clean safe drinking water
I<00:04:07.950> really<00:04:08.640> hope<00:04:08.790> that<00:04:09.000> aquifer<00:04:09.480> life<00:04:09.630> I<00:04:09.750> know<00:04:09.840> I

00:04:09.920 --> 00:04:09.930 
I really hope that aquifer life I know I

00:04:09.930 --> 00:04:11.330 
I really hope that aquifer life I know I
should<00:04:10.170> have<00:04:10.200> done<00:04:10.380> more<00:04:10.410> research<00:04:10.770> I<00:04:11.040> haven't

00:04:11.330 --> 00:04:11.340 
should have done more research I haven't

00:04:11.340 --> 00:04:13.640 
should have done more research I haven't
yet<00:04:11.580> i<00:04:11.730> will<00:04:11.790> be<00:04:12.150> but<00:04:12.780> i<00:04:12.810> really<00:04:13.230> hope<00:04:13.440> that

00:04:13.640 --> 00:04:13.650 
yet i will be but i really hope that

00:04:13.650 --> 00:04:16.759 
yet i will be but i really hope that

like that to these communities i'm not

00:04:21.329 --> 00:04:22.640 
like that to these communities i'm not
sure<00:04:21.540> if<00:04:21.600> they're<00:04:21.720> just<00:04:21.870> providing<00:04:22.320> the<00:04:22.440> water

00:04:22.640 --> 00:04:22.650 
sure if they're just providing the water

00:04:22.650 --> 00:04:24.320 
sure if they're just providing the water
like<00:04:22.919> shipping<00:04:23.190> it<00:04:23.370> over<00:04:23.520> i<00:04:23.550> doubt<00:04:24.300> that

00:04:24.320 --> 00:04:24.330 
like shipping it over i doubt that

00:04:24.330 --> 00:04:26.210 
like shipping it over i doubt that
that's<00:04:24.690> a<00:04:24.840> very<00:04:25.050> inefficient<00:04:25.320> way<00:04:25.770> of<00:04:25.800> doing

00:04:26.210 --> 00:04:26.220 
that's a very inefficient way of doing

00:04:26.220 --> 00:04:29.090 
that's a very inefficient way of doing
things<00:04:26.400> but<00:04:27.120> because<00:04:27.630> water<00:04:27.840> so<00:04:28.050> heavy<00:04:28.260> but<00:04:28.890> um

00:04:29.090 --> 00:04:29.100 
things but because water so heavy but um

00:04:29.100 --> 00:04:32.290 
things but because water so heavy but um
i'm<00:04:29.820> pretty<00:04:30.630> sure<00:04:30.750> the<00:04:30.960> building<00:04:31.380> swells<00:04:31.950> and

00:04:32.290 --> 00:04:32.300 
i'm pretty sure the building swells and

00:04:32.300 --> 00:04:34.220 
i'm pretty sure the building swells and
sustainable<00:04:33.300> sources<00:04:33.630> of<00:04:33.660> water<00:04:33.870> for<00:04:34.110> these

00:04:34.220 --> 00:04:34.230 
sustainable sources of water for these

00:04:34.230 --> 00:04:36.080 
sustainable sources of water for these
communities<00:04:34.710> so<00:04:34.890> it's<00:04:35.100> incredible<00:04:35.700> so<00:04:35.880> if<00:04:36.000> you

00:04:36.080 --> 00:04:36.090 
communities so it's incredible so if you
