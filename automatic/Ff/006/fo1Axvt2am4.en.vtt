00:00:51.050 --> 00:00:56.120
 hello youtube friends here again 

00:00:53.960 --> 00:00:59.059
 soul christel with a new video top 

00:00:56.120 --> 00:01:01.280
 about the best 5 games according to me with 

00:00:59.059 --> 00:01:03.829
 the best and aster sex or eggs 

00:01:01.280 --> 00:01:05.960
 easter in spanish good to be clear 

00:01:03.829 --> 00:01:08.270
 the video is about the best games that 

00:01:05.960 --> 00:01:10.790
 they have easter eggs not on 

00:01:08.270 --> 00:01:13.729
 best easter eggs that I will 

00:01:10.790 --> 00:01:16.130
 then xd for those who do not know it 

00:01:13.729 --> 00:01:18.350
 easter egg is a hallucination error 

00:01:16.130 --> 00:01:20.300
 or minigame or droll animation or 

00:01:18.350 --> 00:01:23.119
 funny that appear in the mini 

00:01:20.300 --> 00:01:26.030
 these games usually several much 

00:01:23.119 --> 00:01:28.460
 and there are too many to count however 

00:01:26.030 --> 00:01:30.770
 to entertain them for a while I brought them a 

00:01:28.460 --> 00:01:33.770
 top 5 about the games that the 

00:01:30.770 --> 00:01:36.410
 best easter eggs however not 

00:01:33.770 --> 00:01:38.630
 I will delve into these without mentioning 

00:01:36.410 --> 00:01:41.660
 that there are other various titles that have 

00:01:38.630 --> 00:01:44.500
 even one but it's very good now 

00:01:41.660 --> 00:01:44.500
 yes let's start 

00:01:45.520 --> 00:01:50.409
 I'll start with the last of us' good the 

00:01:48.549 --> 00:01:53.500
 truth is that this is the favorite game 

00:01:50.409 --> 00:01:55.600
 However PS3 also has very 

00:01:53.500 --> 00:01:57.369
 good easter eggs such as 

00:01:55.600 --> 00:02:00.819
 references to hack and dexter oa 

00:01:57.369 --> 00:02:03.100
 uncharted as well as street fighter al 

00:02:00.819 --> 00:02:05.530
 just as we find very curious things 

00:02:03.100 --> 00:02:07.750
 as bands disks that exist or at 

00:02:05.530 --> 00:02:10.390
 just like we can find a ps3 in 

00:02:07.750 --> 00:02:12.489
 certain precise places or references to 

00:02:10.390 --> 00:02:14.349
 large commercial brands like 

00:02:12.489 --> 00:02:17.019
 ice cream and even a parody of 

00:02:14.349 --> 00:02:19.750
 twilight however these eggs from 

00:02:17.019 --> 00:02:21.610
 Easter are very difficult to find or 

00:02:19.750 --> 00:02:24.489
 to notice even though they are in front of 

00:02:21.610 --> 00:02:26.500
 us and some in very bad taste as 

00:02:24.489 --> 00:02:28.900
 that justin bieber will be drake in a 

00:02:26.500 --> 00:02:30.700
 uncharted movie is to say no 

00:02:28.900 --> 00:02:32.530
 chinguen by itself already ruined the 

00:02:30.700 --> 00:02:35.500
 Batman movie making him robin 

00:02:32.530 --> 00:02:37.450
 along with ben affleck seriously do not fuck 

00:02:35.500 --> 00:02:39.340
 with that 'batman and robin' are going to go to 

00:02:37.450 --> 00:02:41.230
 the shit in the movies 

00:02:39.340 --> 00:02:43.560
 let's hope it's just a typical troll 

00:02:41.230 --> 00:02:43.560
 joke 

00:02:44.490 --> 00:02:49.680
 let's go to jairo well I think you already know 

00:02:47.760 --> 00:02:52.320
 This game has very good eggs 

00:02:49.680 --> 00:02:54.210
 easter in all his deliveries but without 

00:02:52.320 --> 00:02:56.430
 most doubt is to skip 

00:02:54.210 --> 00:02:59.130
 another part of the map or just 

00:02:56.430 --> 00:03:01.170
 return you define principle although without 

00:02:59.130 --> 00:03:03.090
 doubt the easter eggs are very good 

00:03:01.170 --> 00:03:05.490
 especially by the reference of 

00:03:03.090 --> 00:03:08.460
 enemies or other game soldiers 

00:03:05.490 --> 00:03:11.430
 but still most are repetitive 

00:03:08.460 --> 00:03:13.260
 in my opinion or morbid like this egg 

00:03:11.430 --> 00:03:15.120
 of easter is to say no chinguen 

00:03:13.260 --> 00:03:17.280
 They find Cortana and the first thing 

00:03:15.120 --> 00:03:20.840
 do is see the breasts and then the ass 

00:03:17.280 --> 00:03:20.840
 fuck we are screwed 

00:03:26.360 --> 00:03:31.400
 then the third find 

00:03:29.030 --> 00:03:34.340
 gears of war the truth I think the 

00:03:31.400 --> 00:03:37.400
 favorite of the 360 ​​for us the 

00:03:34.340 --> 00:03:39.620
 Latino xd the game well from the 

00:03:37.400 --> 00:03:41.800
 second delivery had very good eggs 

00:03:39.620 --> 00:03:44.450
 of Easter as the locus toaster 

00:03:41.800 --> 00:03:46.610
 then in the third installment with the 

00:03:44.450 --> 00:03:48.860
 famed sun beard as well as chicken 

00:03:46.610 --> 00:03:51.530
 giant that attacks you or the famous spear 

00:03:48.860 --> 00:03:53.690
 chickens seriously there are very good eggs 

00:03:51.530 --> 00:03:55.820
 easter as in their scenarios in 

00:03:53.690 --> 00:03:58.790
 line in which you can see locust 

00:03:55.820 --> 00:04:00.860
 dancing in prison x that's why 

00:03:58.790 --> 00:04:04.900
 in third place also because the 

00:04:00.860 --> 00:04:04.900
 most do not have much transcendent 

00:04:08.420 --> 00:04:12.950
 then in third place one of my 

00:04:10.730 --> 00:04:15.860
 favorite call of duty 

00:04:12.950 --> 00:04:17.959
 this time black ops 2 undoubtedly a 

00:04:15.860 --> 00:04:20.630
 game with too many easter eggs 

00:04:17.959 --> 00:04:22.700
 each one better than the other without doubt the 

00:04:20.630 --> 00:04:24.950
 great variety and great maps make 

00:04:22.700 --> 00:04:27.470
 these easter eggs are very welcome because 

00:04:24.950 --> 00:04:30.169
 there is one on each map then they are 

00:04:27.470 --> 00:04:33.020
 better in mode are 10 in which they are 

00:04:30.169 --> 00:04:34.910
 excessively entertaining the truth is 

00:04:33.020 --> 00:04:37.970
 that this one won over the previous ones for a 

00:04:34.910 --> 00:04:39.620
 simple fact the trophies or achievements is 

00:04:37.970 --> 00:04:41.570
 say that there is better than an egg of 

00:04:39.620 --> 00:04:45.229
 easter that in doing this gives you a 

00:04:41.570 --> 00:04:47.540
 trophy or achievement certainly nothing however 

00:04:45.229 --> 00:04:49.970
 the second place is because these are 

00:04:47.540 --> 00:04:52.250
 very difficult to get without mentioning 

00:04:49.970 --> 00:04:54.260
 impossible by only one since the 

00:04:52.250 --> 00:04:56.930
 everyone asks you four 

00:04:54.260 --> 00:05:00.050
 players and only two ask you minimum 

00:04:56.930 --> 00:05:02.450
 x of this case is origins and modes of 

00:05:00.050 --> 00:05:04.880
 age but the truth is that as much as 

00:05:02.450 --> 00:05:06.919
 the songs animations or even 

00:05:04.880 --> 00:05:10.450
 minigames that these easter eggs 

00:05:06.919 --> 00:05:10.450
 They are excellent 

00:05:11.940 --> 00:05:17.550
 well in the first place we find the 

00:05:14.610 --> 00:05:20.040
 gta 5 well maybe they will not give you trophies 

00:05:17.550 --> 00:05:22.170
 maybe they will not serve you for anything but without 

00:05:20.040 --> 00:05:24.510
 It is very fun to go and look for new ones 

00:05:22.170 --> 00:05:26.970
 things like easter eggs in all 

00:05:24.510 --> 00:05:29.130
 saints is to say this always you 

00:05:26.970 --> 00:05:31.950
 have fun or surprise you because of the 

00:05:29.130 --> 00:05:34.140
 amount and where the truth is located 

00:05:31.950 --> 00:05:35.970
 is that these easter eggs are not 

00:05:34.140 --> 00:05:38.340
 difficult and yet they are very 

00:05:35.970 --> 00:05:40.740
 more fun since there are some that are 

00:05:38.340 --> 00:05:42.810
 can do online but well 

00:05:40.740 --> 00:05:44.910
 remember they are the best games with 

00:05:42.810 --> 00:05:47.370
 some of the best easter eggs 

00:05:44.910 --> 00:05:49.590
 but rest assured that when I do 

00:05:47.370 --> 00:05:53.420
 the top of best easter eggs these 

00:05:49.590 --> 00:05:53.420
 posts will change dramatically 

00:05:54.129 --> 00:05:59.349
 well that has been everything I hope you have 

00:05:56.800 --> 00:06:02.199
 liked and if so you already know comment 

00:05:59.349 --> 00:06:03.580
 subscribe follow in hand up if 

00:06:02.199 --> 00:06:05.860

00:06:03.580 --> 00:06:08.110

00:06:05.860 --> 00:06:10.839

00:06:08.110 --> 00:06:13.289
