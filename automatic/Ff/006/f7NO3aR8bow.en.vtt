in this segment we're going to talk

00:00:13.019 --> 00:00:15.440 
in this segment we're going to talk
about<00:00:13.049> triangles<00:00:13.889> triangles<00:00:14.820> range<00:00:15.059> in<00:00:15.210> size

00:00:15.440 --> 00:00:15.450 
about triangles triangles range in size

00:00:15.450 --> 00:00:17.300 
about triangles triangles range in size
from<00:00:15.480> about<00:00:15.809> four<00:00:16.230> inches<00:00:16.560> to<00:00:16.770> about<00:00:16.859> twelve

00:00:17.300 --> 00:00:17.310 
from about four inches to about twelve

00:00:17.310 --> 00:00:20.120 
from about four inches to about twelve
inches<00:00:17.730> the<00:00:18.330> most<00:00:18.480> typical<00:00:18.630> size<00:00:19.080> is<00:00:19.410> six<00:00:19.980> to

00:00:20.120 --> 00:00:20.130 
inches the most typical size is six to

00:00:20.130 --> 00:00:22.849 
inches the most typical size is six to
nine<00:00:20.340> inches<00:00:20.900> when<00:00:21.900> selecting<00:00:22.320> a<00:00:22.380> triangle

00:00:22.849 --> 00:00:22.859 
nine inches when selecting a triangle

00:00:22.859 --> 00:00:24.650 
nine inches when selecting a triangle
you<00:00:23.250> want<00:00:23.400> to<00:00:23.460> find<00:00:23.699> one<00:00:23.880> that<00:00:23.910> has<00:00:24.060> a<00:00:24.390> lot<00:00:24.630> of

00:00:24.650 --> 00:00:24.660 
you want to find one that has a lot of

00:00:24.660 --> 00:00:26.750 
you want to find one that has a lot of
overtones<00:00:25.350> so<00:00:25.590> you<00:00:25.650> get<00:00:25.800> this<00:00:25.920> shimmery<00:00:26.580> kind

00:00:26.750 --> 00:00:26.760 
overtones so you get this shimmery kind

00:00:26.760 --> 00:00:29.179 
overtones so you get this shimmery kind
of<00:00:26.939> sound<00:00:27.180> nothing<00:00:27.900> with<00:00:28.019> too<00:00:28.529> clean<00:00:28.949> of<00:00:29.130> a

00:00:29.179 --> 00:00:29.189 
of sound nothing with too clean of a

00:00:29.189 --> 00:00:31.220 
of sound nothing with too clean of a
tone<00:00:29.460> anything<00:00:30.060> that's<00:00:30.210> too<00:00:30.420> direct<00:00:30.900> in<00:00:31.080> its

00:00:31.220 --> 00:00:31.230 
tone anything that's too direct in its

00:00:31.230 --> 00:00:34.370 
tone anything that's too direct in its
sound<00:00:32.360> now<00:00:33.360> another<00:00:33.540> really<00:00:33.809> important<00:00:34.290> part

00:00:34.370 --> 00:00:34.380 
sound now another really important part

00:00:34.380 --> 00:00:35.420 
sound now another really important part
of<00:00:34.500> playing<00:00:34.590> a<00:00:34.739> triangle<00:00:35.070> of<00:00:35.130> course<00:00:35.340> is

00:00:35.420 --> 00:00:35.430 
of playing a triangle of course is

00:00:35.430 --> 00:00:37.910 
of playing a triangle of course is
having<00:00:35.520> a<00:00:35.730> great<00:00:35.910> clip<00:00:36.500> when<00:00:37.500> selecting<00:00:37.860> a

00:00:37.910 --> 00:00:37.920 
having a great clip when selecting a

00:00:37.920 --> 00:00:40.190 
having a great clip when selecting a
clip<00:00:38.250> you<00:00:38.969> want<00:00:39.030> to<00:00:39.180> find<00:00:39.450> one<00:00:39.719> where<00:00:40.110> the

00:00:40.190 --> 00:00:40.200 
clip you want to find one where the

00:00:40.200 --> 00:00:41.780 
clip you want to find one where the
triangles<00:00:40.530> not<00:00:40.649> going<00:00:40.800> to<00:00:40.860> hang<00:00:41.100> too<00:00:41.430> low

00:00:41.780 --> 00:00:41.790 
triangles not going to hang too low

00:00:41.790 --> 00:00:43.819 
triangles not going to hang too low
because<00:00:42.690> then<00:00:42.899> it<00:00:43.020> will<00:00:43.079> spin<00:00:43.440> and<00:00:43.590> be<00:00:43.649> very

00:00:43.819 --> 00:00:43.829 
because then it will spin and be very

00:00:43.829 --> 00:00:46.040 
because then it will spin and be very
difficult<00:00:44.010> to<00:00:44.280> play<00:00:44.550> you<00:00:45.539> want<00:00:45.690> to<00:00:45.750> make<00:00:45.870> sure

00:00:46.040 --> 00:00:46.050 
difficult to play you want to make sure

00:00:46.050 --> 00:00:47.869 
difficult to play you want to make sure
that<00:00:46.230> what<00:00:46.680> you're<00:00:46.770> suspending<00:00:47.370> the<00:00:47.460> triangle

00:00:47.869 --> 00:00:47.879 
that what you're suspending the triangle

00:00:47.879 --> 00:00:50.389 
that what you're suspending the triangle
with<00:00:48.000> is<00:00:48.180> either<00:00:48.300> a<00:00:48.450> nylon<00:00:49.440> string<00:00:49.890> or<00:00:50.370> fishing

00:00:50.389 --> 00:00:50.399 
with is either a nylon string or fishing

00:00:50.399 --> 00:00:52.729 
with is either a nylon string or fishing
line<00:00:51.000> that<00:00:51.660> way<00:00:51.809> you're<00:00:52.020> not<00:00:52.079> dampening<00:00:52.620> the

00:00:52.729 --> 00:00:52.739 
line that way you're not dampening the

00:00:52.739 --> 00:00:54.860 
line that way you're not dampening the
resonance<00:00:53.190> of<00:00:53.309> the<00:00:53.370> triangle<00:00:53.969> it's<00:00:54.660> also<00:00:54.780> a

00:00:54.860 --> 00:00:54.870 
resonance of the triangle it's also a

00:00:54.870 --> 00:00:56.810 
resonance of the triangle it's also a
great<00:00:55.199> idea<00:00:55.230> to<00:00:55.649> have<00:00:55.680> two<00:00:56.160> loops<00:00:56.489> of<00:00:56.699> the

00:00:56.810 --> 00:00:56.820 
great idea to have two loops of the

00:00:56.820 --> 00:00:58.819 
great idea to have two loops of the
nylon<00:00:57.180> string<00:00:57.510> or<00:00:57.660> fishing<00:00:57.690> line<00:00:58.170> in<00:00:58.530> case<00:00:58.649> one

00:00:58.819 --> 00:00:58.829 
nylon string or fishing line in case one

00:00:58.829 --> 00:01:00.080 
nylon string or fishing line in case one
of<00:00:58.859> them<00:00:58.980> breaks<00:00:59.039> during<00:00:59.489> a<00:00:59.579> concert<00:00:59.969> or

00:01:00.080 --> 00:01:00.090 
of them breaks during a concert or

00:01:00.090 --> 00:01:01.520 
of them breaks during a concert or
rehearsal<00:01:00.539> then<00:01:00.989> you've<00:01:01.140> got<00:01:01.230> one<00:01:01.379> of<00:01:01.469> the

00:01:01.520 --> 00:01:01.530 
rehearsal then you've got one of the

00:01:01.530 --> 00:01:05.929 
rehearsal then you've got one of the
backup<00:01:03.769> when<00:01:04.769> selecting<00:01:05.070> a<00:01:05.159> triangle<00:01:05.580> beater

00:01:05.929 --> 00:01:05.939 
backup when selecting a triangle beater

00:01:05.939 --> 00:01:07.520 
backup when selecting a triangle beater
it's<00:01:06.360> a<00:01:06.420> good<00:01:06.570> idea<00:01:06.600> to<00:01:06.810> have<00:01:06.990> a<00:01:07.020> variety<00:01:07.500> of

00:01:07.520 --> 00:01:07.530 
it's a good idea to have a variety of

00:01:07.530 --> 00:01:10.100 
it's a good idea to have a variety of
different<00:01:07.920> sizes<00:01:08.159> at<00:01:08.460> your<00:01:08.610> disposal<00:01:09.110> thinner

00:01:10.100 --> 00:01:10.110 
different sizes at your disposal thinner

00:01:10.110 --> 00:01:15.580 
different sizes at your disposal thinner
triangle<00:01:10.590> beaters<00:01:10.860> are<00:01:11.040> able<00:01:11.460> to<00:01:11.549> play<00:01:11.729> softer

00:01:15.580 --> 00:01:15.590 

00:01:15.590 --> 00:01:18.890 

well<00:01:16.590> thicker<00:01:16.920> triangle<00:01:17.369> beaters<00:01:17.700> are<00:01:17.909> able

00:01:18.890 --> 00:01:18.900 
well thicker triangle beaters are able

00:01:18.900 --> 00:01:20.840 
well thicker triangle beaters are able
to<00:01:18.960> play<00:01:19.170> louder<00:01:19.439> and<00:01:19.770> also<00:01:20.040> activate<00:01:20.490> more<00:01:20.759> of

00:01:20.840 --> 00:01:20.850 
to play louder and also activate more of

00:01:20.850 --> 00:01:28.440 
to play louder and also activate more of
the<00:01:20.939> overtones<00:01:21.420> of<00:01:21.600> the<00:01:21.689> instrument

00:01:28.440 --> 00:01:28.450 

00:01:28.450 --> 00:01:30.400 

now<00:01:29.450> let's<00:01:29.570> talk<00:01:29.660> about<00:01:29.720> how<00:01:29.990> to<00:01:30.020> play<00:01:30.260> the

00:01:30.400 --> 00:01:30.410 
now let's talk about how to play the

00:01:30.410 --> 00:01:32.350 
now let's talk about how to play the
triangle<00:01:30.700> first<00:01:31.700> let's<00:01:31.910> figure<00:01:32.030> out<00:01:32.150> how<00:01:32.270> to

00:01:32.350 --> 00:01:32.360 
triangle first let's figure out how to

00:01:32.360 --> 00:01:34.360 
triangle first let's figure out how to
hold<00:01:32.570> it<00:01:32.740> now<00:01:33.740> you're<00:01:33.890> going<00:01:34.010> to<00:01:34.070> hold<00:01:34.190> the

00:01:34.360 --> 00:01:34.370 
hold it now you're going to hold the

00:01:34.370 --> 00:01:36.670 
hold it now you're going to hold the
clip<00:01:34.670> while<00:01:34.850> you're<00:01:35.000> playing<00:01:35.300> by<00:01:36.050> making<00:01:36.350> a<00:01:36.410> C

typically<00:01:56.330> when<00:01:56.540> playing<00:01:56.810> the<00:01:56.990> triangle

00:01:57.400 --> 00:01:57.410 
typically when playing the triangle

00:01:57.410 --> 00:01:58.240 
typically when playing the triangle
you're<00:01:57.470> going<00:01:57.620> to<00:01:57.680> want<00:01:57.800> to<00:01:57.860> play<00:01:57.980> on<00:01:58.130> this

00:01:58.240 --> 00:01:58.250 
you're going to want to play on this
