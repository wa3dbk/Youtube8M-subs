the<00:00:23.830> Incheon<00:00:24.189> tower<00:00:24.520> and<00:00:24.939> it<00:00:25.390> was<00:00:25.510> 1,500<00:00:26.350> acres

00:00:26.519 --> 00:00:26.529 
the Incheon tower and it was 1,500 acres

00:00:26.529 --> 00:00:34.020 
the Incheon tower and it was 1,500 acres
of<00:00:27.010> new<00:00:27.970> land<00:00:28.270> landfill<00:00:29.820> and<00:00:31.830> connected<00:00:33.030> by

00:00:34.020 --> 00:00:34.030 
of new land landfill and connected by

00:00:34.030 --> 00:00:35.910 
of new land landfill and connected by
this<00:00:34.270> new<00:00:34.510> bridge<00:00:34.809> coming<00:00:35.199> from<00:00:35.530> the<00:00:35.710> new

said Incheon and you all right you knew

00:01:33.130 --> 00:01:37.350 
said Incheon and you all right you knew
it<00:01:34.260> it<00:01:35.260> couldn't<00:01:35.830> be<00:01:35.890> just<00:01:36.490> another<00:01:36.790> building

00:01:37.350 --> 00:01:37.360 
it it couldn't be just another building

00:01:37.360 --> 00:01:39.240 
it it couldn't be just another building
I<00:01:37.600> mean<00:01:37.960> it<00:01:38.140> couldn't<00:01:38.500> be<00:01:38.680> just<00:01:38.950> another

00:01:39.240 --> 00:01:39.250 
I mean it couldn't be just another

00:01:39.250 --> 00:01:43.860 
I mean it couldn't be just another
building<00:01:41.520> you<00:01:42.520> know<00:01:42.640> I<00:01:42.670> compared<00:01:43.420> to<00:01:43.660> the

00:01:43.860 --> 00:01:43.870 
building you know I compared to the

00:01:43.870 --> 00:01:46.800 
building you know I compared to the
Eiffel<00:01:44.260> Tower<00:01:44.290> from<00:01:44.920> France<00:01:45.580> you<00:01:46.300> know<00:01:46.480> the

Sydney Opera House Australia some of

00:01:50.050 --> 00:01:54.380 
Sydney Opera House Australia some of
these<00:01:50.140> buildings<00:01:50.500> that<00:01:51.010> are<00:01:52.140> that<00:01:53.140> you<00:01:53.620> see<00:01:53.950> it

00:01:54.380 --> 00:01:54.390 
these buildings that are that you see it

00:01:54.390 --> 00:01:56.550 
these buildings that are that you see it
no<00:01:55.390> matter<00:01:55.570> where<00:01:55.780> you<00:01:55.810> see<00:01:56.140> it<00:01:56.170> you<00:01:56.409> know

00:01:56.550 --> 00:01:56.560 
no matter where you see it you know

00:01:56.560 --> 00:01:58.200 
no matter where you see it you know
exactly<00:01:56.980> where<00:01:57.159> it<00:01:57.190> is<00:01:57.400> and<00:01:57.730> it's<00:01:57.880> it's

00:01:58.200 --> 00:01:58.210 
exactly where it is and it's it's

00:01:58.210 --> 00:02:04.380 
exactly where it is and it's it's
constant<00:01:59.080> marketing<00:02:00.600> element<00:02:03.030> but<00:02:04.030> the<00:02:04.240> other

00:02:04.380 --> 00:02:04.390 
constant marketing element but the other

00:02:04.390 --> 00:02:07.410 
constant marketing element but the other
thing<00:02:04.690> was<00:02:04.990> the<00:02:05.920> vision<00:02:06.310> of<00:02:06.460> Koreans

00:02:07.410 --> 00:02:07.420 
thing was the vision of Koreans

00:02:07.420 --> 00:02:16.290 
thing was the vision of Koreans
eventually<00:02:10.620> reuniting<00:02:11.620> as<00:02:12.450> Germany<00:02:13.450> and<00:02:15.300> so

00:02:16.290 --> 00:02:16.300 
eventually reuniting as Germany and so

00:02:16.300 --> 00:02:19.110 
eventually reuniting as Germany and so
the<00:02:16.750> combination<00:02:17.170> of<00:02:17.650> these<00:02:17.860> things<00:02:18.220> one<00:02:19.090> of

00:02:19.110 --> 00:02:19.120 
the combination of these things one of

00:02:19.120 --> 00:02:24.780 
the combination of these things one of
the<00:02:19.360> point<00:02:19.720> most<00:02:20.290> of<00:02:20.560> the<00:02:20.680> high-rise<00:02:21.329> towers

00:02:24.780 --> 00:02:24.790 

00:02:24.790 --> 00:02:27.130 

really<00:02:25.790> high-rise<00:02:26.210> towers<00:02:26.660> when<00:02:26.840> you<00:02:26.960> get

00:02:27.130 --> 00:02:27.140 
really high-rise towers when you get

00:02:27.140 --> 00:02:31.360 
really high-rise towers when you get
this<00:02:27.320> high<00:02:28.690> they<00:02:29.690> go<00:02:30.140> down<00:02:30.350> like<00:02:30.680> this<00:02:30.740> and

00:02:31.360 --> 00:02:31.370 
this high they go down like this and

00:02:31.370 --> 00:02:33.840 
this high they go down like this and
when<00:02:32.240> you<00:02:32.360> get<00:02:32.450> to<00:02:32.630> the<00:02:32.780> top<00:02:32.810> there's<00:02:33.560> nothing

00:02:33.840 --> 00:02:33.850 
when you get to the top there's nothing

00:02:33.850 --> 00:02:39.730 
when you get to the top there's nothing
it's<00:02:34.850> nothing<00:02:35.090> up<00:02:35.420> you<00:02:35.570> can't<00:02:35.900> do<00:02:36.080> that<00:02:38.740> we

00:02:39.730 --> 00:02:39.740 
it's nothing up you can't do that we

00:02:39.740 --> 00:02:44.200 
it's nothing up you can't do that we
want<00:02:40.310> it<00:02:40.430> to<00:02:40.580> take<00:02:41.110> and<00:02:42.520> make<00:02:43.520> the<00:02:43.760> whole<00:02:43.970> plane

00:02:44.200 --> 00:02:44.210 
want it to take and make the whole plane

00:02:44.210 --> 00:02:49.930 
want it to take and make the whole plane
functional<00:02:44.900> all<00:02:45.110> the<00:02:45.290> way<00:02:45.440> and<00:02:47.380> and<00:02:48.430> so<00:02:49.430> that

00:02:49.930 --> 00:02:49.940 
functional all the way and and so that

00:02:49.940 --> 00:02:54.040 
functional all the way and and so that
meant<00:02:51.100> splitting<00:02:52.100> it<00:02:52.280> and<00:02:52.490> and<00:02:52.880> treating<00:02:53.870> it

00:02:54.040 --> 00:02:54.050 
meant splitting it and and treating it

00:02:54.050 --> 00:02:58.170 
meant splitting it and and treating it
almost<00:02:54.470> like<00:02:54.680> a<00:02:54.740> vertical<00:02:55.460> trust<00:02:55.820> and<00:02:56.830> the

00:02:58.170 --> 00:02:58.180 
almost like a vertical trust and the

00:02:58.180 --> 00:03:03.100 
almost like a vertical trust and the
bridge<00:02:59.180> is<00:02:59.770> not<00:03:00.770> only<00:03:01.040> are<00:03:02.110> structurally

00:03:03.100 --> 00:03:03.110 
bridge is not only are structurally

00:03:03.110 --> 00:03:06.310 
bridge is not only are structurally
necessary<00:03:04.210> but<00:03:05.210> they<00:03:05.420> have<00:03:05.630> symbolic<00:03:06.080> meaning

00:03:06.310 --> 00:03:06.320 
necessary but they have symbolic meaning

00:03:06.320 --> 00:03:11.050 
necessary but they have symbolic meaning
as<00:03:07.010> well<00:03:07.280> and<00:03:08.950> marrying<00:03:09.950> the<00:03:10.160> functionality

00:03:11.050 --> 00:03:11.060 
as well and marrying the functionality

00:03:11.060 --> 00:03:15.430 
as well and marrying the functionality
of<00:03:11.090> all<00:03:11.420> that<00:03:11.780> to<00:03:12.580> program<00:03:13.580> the<00:03:14.570> program<00:03:14.720> or<00:03:15.320> go

00:03:15.430 --> 00:03:15.440 
of all that to program the program or go

00:03:15.440 --> 00:03:17.940 
of all that to program the program or go
