you<00:04:26.010> guys<00:04:26.280> are<00:04:26.520> used<00:04:26.730> to<00:04:26.820> me<00:04:27.000> having<00:04:27.360> original

00:04:27.800 --> 00:04:27.810 
you guys are used to me having original

00:04:27.810 --> 00:04:30.350 
you guys are used to me having original
cases<00:04:28.290> who<00:04:29.100> knows<00:04:29.340> what<00:04:29.580> the<00:04:29.669> original<00:04:30.030> cases

00:04:30.350 --> 00:04:30.360 
cases who knows what the original cases

00:04:30.360 --> 00:04:32.030 
cases who knows what the original cases
were<00:04:30.480> I<00:04:30.510> don't<00:04:30.780> think<00:04:30.900> Danelectro<00:04:31.560> even<00:04:31.830> had

00:04:32.030 --> 00:04:32.040 
were I don't think Danelectro even had

00:04:32.040 --> 00:04:33.830 
were I don't think Danelectro even had
original<00:04:32.760> cases<00:04:33.180> for<00:04:33.360> these<00:04:33.450> they<00:04:33.600> probably

00:04:33.830 --> 00:04:33.840 
original cases for these they probably

00:04:33.840 --> 00:04:35.810 
original cases for these they probably
use<00:04:34.140> whatever<00:04:34.680> was<00:04:34.980> laying<00:04:35.160> around<00:04:35.280> the<00:04:35.580> store

00:04:35.810 --> 00:04:35.820

so I don't have an original case just

00:04:37.710 --> 00:04:39.260 
so I don't have an original case just
