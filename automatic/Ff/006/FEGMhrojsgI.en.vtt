the<00:01:40.500> clip<00:01:40.680> just<00:01:41.040> before<00:01:41.159> the<00:01:41.430> night<00:01:41.549> we

00:01:41.630 --> 00:01:41.640 
the clip just before the night we

00:01:41.640 --> 00:01:44.480 
the clip just before the night we
departed<00:01:42.060> I<00:01:42.409> had<00:01:43.409> a<00:01:43.439> chat<00:01:43.710> with<00:01:43.740> wax<00:01:44.040> tonight

00:01:44.480 --> 00:01:44.490 
departed I had a chat with wax tonight

00:01:44.490 --> 00:01:47.240 
departed I had a chat with wax tonight
so<00:01:44.790> we<00:01:44.939> pretty<00:01:45.119> much<00:01:45.240> did<00:01:45.420> a<00:01:45.720> a<00:01:46.320> meal<00:01:46.710> split

00:01:47.240 --> 00:01:47.250 
so we pretty much did a a meal split

00:01:47.250 --> 00:01:50.359 
so we pretty much did a a meal split
with<00:01:47.640> Walmart<00:01:48.119> security<00:01:48.860> so<00:01:49.860> we<00:01:50.130> won't<00:01:50.250> be

00:01:50.359 --> 00:01:50.369 
with Walmart security so we won't be

00:01:50.369 --> 00:01:52.969 
with Walmart security so we won't be
rating<00:01:51.149> with<00:01:51.299> them<00:01:51.420> anymore<00:01:51.659> I<00:01:52.079> believe<00:01:52.680> some

00:01:52.969 --> 00:01:52.979 
rating with them anymore I believe some

00:01:52.979 --> 00:01:54.920 
rating with them anymore I believe some
people<00:01:53.369> may<00:01:53.640> be<00:01:53.700> putting<00:01:54.060> an<00:01:54.149> application<00:01:54.780> in

00:01:54.920 --> 00:01:54.930 
people may be putting an application in

00:01:54.930 --> 00:01:56.899 
people may be putting an application in
from<00:01:55.290> their<00:01:55.439> side<00:01:55.770> who<00:01:56.189> still<00:01:56.430> want<00:01:56.640> to<00:01:56.729> raid

00:01:56.899 --> 00:01:56.909 
from their side who still want to raid

00:01:56.909 --> 00:01:58.670 
from their side who still want to raid
with<00:01:56.939> us<00:01:57.210> and<00:01:57.479> be<00:01:57.540> a<00:01:57.960> little<00:01:58.049> more<00:01:58.229> serious

00:01:58.670 --> 00:01:58.680 
with us and be a little more serious

00:01:58.680 --> 00:02:01.249 
with us and be a little more serious
than<00:01:58.799> they<00:01:58.950> have<00:01:59.100> been<00:01:59.280> so<00:02:00.270> I<00:02:00.659> guess<00:02:00.869> look<00:02:01.079> for

00:02:01.249 --> 00:02:01.259 
than they have been so I guess look for

00:02:01.259 --> 00:02:03.109 
than they have been so I guess look for
those<00:02:01.380> I<00:02:01.740> mean<00:02:01.890> obviously<00:02:02.070> asking<00:02:02.700> questions

00:02:03.109 --> 00:02:03.119 
those I mean obviously asking questions

00:02:03.119 --> 00:02:05.929 
those I mean obviously asking questions
and<00:02:03.240> whatnot<00:02:03.360> so<00:02:03.780> we<00:02:04.770> are<00:02:05.460> still<00:02:05.640> going<00:02:05.759> to<00:02:05.850> be

00:02:05.929 --> 00:02:05.939 
and whatnot so we are still going to be

00:02:05.939 --> 00:02:07.819 
and whatnot so we are still going to be
looking<00:02:06.240> for<00:02:06.450> other<00:02:06.600> options<00:02:06.869> to<00:02:07.229> continue<00:02:07.710> to

00:02:07.819 --> 00:02:07.829 
looking for other options to continue to

think<00:02:12.870> we<00:02:12.959> had<00:02:13.110> another

00:02:13.610 --> 00:02:13.620 
think we had another

00:02:13.620 --> 00:02:17.030 
think we had another
it<00:02:13.709> made<00:02:14.069> a<00:02:14.400> pin<00:02:14.730> and<00:02:15.030> I<00:02:15.390> think<00:02:15.840> Damon<00:02:16.709> off<00:02:16.830> has

00:02:17.030 --> 00:02:17.040 
it made a pin and I think Damon off has

00:02:17.040 --> 00:02:19.210 
it made a pin and I think Damon off has
a<00:02:17.069> friend<00:02:17.459> who<00:02:17.640> may<00:02:17.819> be<00:02:17.879> applying<00:02:18.360> also<00:02:18.840> who

00:02:19.210 --> 00:02:19.220 
a friend who may be applying also who

00:02:19.220 --> 00:02:21.710 
a friend who may be applying also who
will<00:02:20.220> probably<00:02:20.549> bring<00:02:20.700> another<00:02:20.970> range<00:02:21.299> for<00:02:21.599> us

00:02:21.710 --> 00:02:21.720 
will probably bring another range for us

00:02:21.720 --> 00:02:23.930 
will probably bring another range for us
an<00:02:21.870> elemental<00:02:22.260> shaman<00:02:22.590> or<00:02:22.709> something<00:02:23.010> I<00:02:23.220> mean

on cat more than anything as opposed to
bear<00:04:18.590> which<00:04:18.739> is<00:04:18.889> what<00:04:19.010> I<00:04:19.039> did<00:04:19.250> for<00:04:19.519> all<00:04:19.579> the
