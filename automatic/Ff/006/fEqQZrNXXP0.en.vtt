 I thought that it was not completed at all in the ranch , I thought there were only 6 eggs when I saw the test. 

00:00:19.400 --> 00:00:28.400
 It is not enough to go into one more pack , but there were about six of them 

00:00:24.110 --> 00:00:34.190
 If it comes out for a moment with this, I think it will be possible to keep chicken there already 

00:00:28.400 --> 00:00:36.830
 After in this horse I wonder if you Koyo with me Na or later take the way of that rail

00:01:03.150 --> 00:01:06.230

 Quite Well I Once was I there 

00:01:27.230 --> 00:01:36.280
 I think it will be in the near future, but maybe I can't post it recently, so I think it's been a long time for everyone 

00:01:31.730 --> 00:01:36.280
 Yone's story 

00:01:36.900 --> 00:01:44.260

00:01:39.790 --> 00:01:47.870
 So this was not messed up big was a little Well it anymore 

00:01:44.260 --> 00:01:50.620

00:01:47.870 --> 00:01:50.620

00:01:51.060 --> 00:02:00.299
 By the way, I don't know what it is but I'm sorry that Torokko's cat is gone

00:02:12.280 --> 00:02:22.120
 If you find a horse stallion then you should find something 

00:02:17.800 --> 00:02:26.980
 Well once Now I'm I want to go with it 

00:02:22.120 --> 00:02:30.130
 There is no saddle, so you have to find a saddle because it is from a cave 

00:02:26.980 --> 00:02:32.880
 I wonder if there will also be a cave part soon 

00:02:30.130 --> 00:02:32.880

00:02:33.180 --> 00:02:40.830

00:03:53.320 --> 00:03:57.540
 It is neglected resistance for the time being of all ages 

00:03:57.750 --> 00:04:03.730

00:05:01.790 --> 00:05:09.080
 This version and version, and whether it was used in the space app 

00:05:05.390 --> 00:05:14.360
 In what state would it be a corner poop 

00:05:09.080 --> 00:05:19.180

 Slime something I Cha' and wetlands Ne'm not at all Let's wait Toka night in there 

00:05:39.120 --> 00:05:41.690
 The lower frame 

00:05:49.260 --> 00:05:57.450
 Resulting in the softening it I have missing wetland 

00:05:52.680 --> 00:06:00.750
 Cormorant or wetlands missing I I'd reaction of slime is no 

00:05:57.450 --> 00:06:04.890
 Wait until night will come out or 

00:06:00.750 --> 00:06:10.040

00:06:04.890 --> 00:06:13.520
 As for the side of slime, I still only know how much to go out in the wetland but I 

00:06:10.040 --> 00:06:19.280
 What the future Naa even this little bit I guess what 

00:06:13.520 --> 00:06:20.600
 In the future, I would like to look at it quite a bit, so I will keep it as a result while protecting it 

00:06:19.280 --> 00:06:25.190
 Ne 

00:06:20.600 --> 00:06:28.300
 Yes I can say I'll wait until night, but it 's going to sink 

00:06:25.190 --> 00:06:33.849
 If it sinks , I will try to have a moment 

00:06:28.300 --> 00:06:37.880
