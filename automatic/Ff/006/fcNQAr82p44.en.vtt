00:00:08.350 --> 00:00:13.040
 the names of the kitchen are essential 

00:00:10.700 --> 00:00:14.570
 so that a house is well organized and 

00:00:13.040 --> 00:00:16.940
 everyone knows that the environment well 

00:00:14.570 --> 00:00:19.130
 decorated brings a sense of well-being 

00:00:16.940 --> 00:00:20.869
 It is common to leave our house 

00:00:19.130 --> 00:00:22.699
 always beautiful but sometimes this 

00:00:20.869 --> 00:00:25.300
 maintenance can mean a cost 

00:00:22.699 --> 00:00:25.300
 very high 

00:00:33.380 --> 00:00:37.860
 we can avoid this cat by making a 

00:00:35.700 --> 00:00:39.239
 the same way that we change the 

00:00:37.860 --> 00:00:40.860
 fabric of our sofa 

00:00:39.239 --> 00:00:44.340
 We can change the finish of our 

00:00:40.860 --> 00:00:46.050
 cook and look at that neither 

00:00:44.340 --> 00:00:48.120
 we need a professional 

00:00:46.050 --> 00:00:50.339
 our production was in search of a 

00:00:48.120 --> 00:00:52.170
 solution to restore 

00:00:50.339 --> 00:00:59.430
 and found the stickers 

00:00:52.170 --> 00:01:01.829
 decorative 2010 

00:00:59.430 --> 00:01:04.080
 there was a need on the part of 

00:01:01.829 --> 00:01:05.700
 some of the athletes we worked with 

00:01:04.080 --> 00:01:07.800
 a material for you to customize 

00:01:05.700 --> 00:01:10.140
 environment for you to make a reform in 

00:01:07.800 --> 00:01:13.289
 clean and fast, and that's where it came 

00:01:10.140 --> 00:01:15.289
 our research and we got to the 

00:01:13.289 --> 00:01:18.360
 sif 

00:01:15.289 --> 00:01:21.869
 it is a versatile material that can 

00:01:18.360 --> 00:01:24.300
 customizing a wall can reform all 

00:01:21.869 --> 00:01:27.179
 the environment a door the inside of a 

00:01:24.300 --> 00:01:29.490
 boat with much more agility a role 

00:01:27.179 --> 00:01:31.140
 of the conventional wall without 

00:01:29.490 --> 00:01:33.030
 durability is much greater 

00:01:31.140 --> 00:01:35.340
 it is a material that the waterproof and 

00:01:33.030 --> 00:01:38.130
 can be used in a humid environment we 

00:01:35.340 --> 00:01:41.490
 we have the thick films that can be 

00:01:38.130 --> 00:01:44.909
 used under tile that does not film the 

00:01:41.490 --> 00:01:47.250
 grout can be used inside the box 

00:01:44.909 --> 00:01:49.079
 so the versatility in number is 

00:01:47.250 --> 00:01:50.490
 a material can be heated and molded 

00:01:49.079 --> 00:01:52.920
 on any surface 

00:01:50.490 --> 00:01:54.720
 The material allows you to self 

00:01:52.920 --> 00:01:57.210
 because it is a material with glue 

00:01:54.720 --> 00:02:00.600
 repositioned very simple to click 

00:01:57.210 --> 00:02:02.939
 you can apply on the wall and then the 

00:02:00.600 --> 00:02:05.549
 after a year or so you do not have 

00:02:02.939 --> 00:02:07.439
 problem you can remove the movie 

00:02:05.549 --> 00:02:11.549
 without any problem, only the wall is in 

00:02:07.439 --> 00:02:13.769
 good conditions the film you use a 

00:02:11.549 --> 00:02:15.690
 thermal blow dryer and blower 

00:02:13.769 --> 00:02:18.030
 removing without damaging the surface 

00:02:15.690 --> 00:02:20.250
 this great advantage in the case of 

00:02:18.030 --> 00:02:22.829
 tiles to fix the most 

00:02:20.250 --> 00:02:24.510
 can be used under the tile 

00:02:22.829 --> 00:02:26.790
 unchecked 

00:02:24.510 --> 00:02:28.110
 so it's not necessary to call a mason 

00:02:26.790 --> 00:02:30.930
 to break 

00:02:28.110 --> 00:02:34.109
 are you going to simply apply the 

00:02:30.930 --> 00:02:35.640
 material in a few minutes you have a 

00:02:34.109 --> 00:02:38.440
 fully renovated environment 

00:02:35.640 --> 00:02:41.260
 the material has a high durability 

00:02:38.440 --> 00:02:43.720
 it has seven years of durability in 

00:02:41.260 --> 00:02:45.970
 new minimum for internal use for 

00:02:43.720 --> 00:02:49.060
 a little less but can also 

00:02:45.970 --> 00:02:51.040
 be used and the quality of the 

00:02:49.060 --> 00:02:52.600
 something that is unprecedented in the 

00:02:51.040 --> 00:02:55.960
 Brazilian market 

00:02:52.600 --> 00:03:00.100
 the prints reproduce hides woods 

00:02:55.960 --> 00:03:03.580
 Glitters stones and your designs are design 

00:03:00.100 --> 00:03:05.590
 Very cool, you reform very quickly. 

00:03:03.580 --> 00:03:08.260
 simple and dirt free 

00:03:05.590 --> 00:03:09.550
 The interesting thing is that there are many 

00:03:08.260 --> 00:03:11.590
 different types 

00:03:09.550 --> 00:03:13.690
 Can you make a very stylish kitchen? 

00:03:11.590 --> 00:03:16.480
 this kitchen was installed seven years ago 

00:03:13.690 --> 00:03:18.070
 that at that time this type of color 

00:03:16.480 --> 00:03:20.080
 type of wood shade was 

00:03:18.070 --> 00:03:22.060
 quite in vogue, there was no fashion 

00:03:20.080 --> 00:03:23.830
 that we want to transform it but yes 

00:03:22.060 --> 00:03:25.960
 sexy for that we chose the 

00:03:23.830 --> 00:03:28.330
 black nikki wood is a wood if well 

00:03:25.960 --> 00:03:30.430
 particular our catalog and everywhere 

00:03:28.330 --> 00:03:32.170
 which is white or the piece of wood 

00:03:30.430 --> 00:03:34.030
 we will transform to leave the 

00:03:32.170 --> 00:03:43.060
 environment or gets a bit more loaded 

00:03:34.030 --> 00:03:44.770
 More modern is already very nice when 

00:03:43.060 --> 00:03:46.120
 Are you seeing this stuff? 

00:03:44.770 --> 00:03:48.610
 easy to apply 

00:03:46.120 --> 00:03:50.770
 it's do-it-yourself stuff and 

00:03:48.610 --> 00:03:52.239
 He's already self-adhesive, which means 

00:03:50.770 --> 00:03:54.730
 this you do not have to use any type 

00:03:52.239 --> 00:03:57.340
 because he himself already has a 

00:03:54.730 --> 00:03:59.950
 force of attraction it is eternal 

00:03:57.340 --> 00:04:02.020
 moldable ie it makes corners 

00:03:59.950 --> 00:04:04.060
 rounded corners and straight corners like you 

00:04:02.020 --> 00:04:06.190
 will see Andrew doing so it is well 

00:04:04.060 --> 00:04:08.860
 interesting and simple to do with a 

00:04:06.190 --> 00:04:11.440
 spatula from the center towards 

00:04:08.860 --> 00:04:13.330
 to the edges you apply and beyond 

00:04:11.440 --> 00:04:15.160
 it does not do any dirt that is 

00:04:13.330 --> 00:04:18.359
 very nice has no odor 

00:04:15.160 --> 00:04:18.359
 you have too much speed 

00:04:19.379 --> 00:04:25.840
 the application can be made by any 

00:04:23.289 --> 00:04:28.029
 person and the owner of the furniture can still 

00:04:25.840 --> 00:04:38.139
 play with finishing and change it when 

00:04:28.029 --> 00:04:40.080
 It 's just technology that shortens. 

00:04:38.139 --> 00:04:43.499
 paths and beauty and practicality 

00:04:40.080 --> 00:04:43.499
 including decoration
