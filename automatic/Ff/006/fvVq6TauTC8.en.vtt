those<00:02:01.200> holes<00:02:01.259> out<00:02:01.710> so<00:02:01.890> I<00:02:01.920> get<00:02:02.130> a<00:02:02.159> good<00:02:02.220> fit<00:02:02.700> a

00:02:02.840 --> 00:02:02.850 
those holes out so I get a good fit a

00:02:02.850 --> 00:02:04.219 
those holes out so I get a good fit a
good<00:02:03.000> match<00:02:03.240> between<00:02:03.479> the<00:02:03.750> bolster<00:02:04.049> and<00:02:04.200> a

00:02:04.219 --> 00:02:04.229 
good match between the bolster and a

00:02:04.229 --> 00:02:06.320 
good match between the bolster and a
handle<00:02:04.530> so<00:02:04.679> that's<00:02:05.490> up<00:02:05.670> gone<00:02:05.880> ahead<00:02:06.000> and<00:02:06.119> done

00:02:06.320 --> 00:02:06.330 
handle so that's up gone ahead and done

00:02:06.330 --> 00:02:08.779 
handle so that's up gone ahead and done
I've<00:02:06.750> already<00:02:07.020> drilled<00:02:07.259> the<00:02:07.440> top<00:02:07.710> now<00:02:08.670> I'm

00:02:08.779 --> 00:02:08.789 
I've already drilled the top now I'm

00:02:08.789 --> 00:02:10.130 
I've already drilled the top now I'm
passing<00:02:09.000> that<00:02:09.330> drill<00:02:09.539> through<00:02:09.810> the<00:02:09.929> top

00:02:10.130 --> 00:02:10.140 
passing that drill through the top

00:02:10.140 --> 00:02:14.350 
passing that drill through the top
through<00:02:10.590> the<00:02:10.739> blade<00:02:10.950> into<00:02:11.430> the<00:02:11.519> bottom<00:02:12.860> and

00:02:14.350 --> 00:02:14.360 
through the blade into the bottom and

00:02:14.360 --> 00:02:19.039 
through the blade into the bottom and
once<00:02:15.360> you<00:02:15.450> get<00:02:15.540> those<00:02:15.720> holes<00:02:15.989> drilled<00:02:17.900> you<00:02:18.900> can

00:02:19.039 --> 00:02:19.049 
once you get those holes drilled you can

00:02:19.049 --> 00:02:36.390 
once you get those holes drilled you can
go<00:02:19.140> ahead<00:02:19.290> and<00:02:19.500> pin<00:02:19.680> those<00:02:19.890> two

00:02:36.390 --> 00:02:36.400 

00:02:36.400 --> 00:02:40.509 

trim<00:02:37.400> down<00:02:37.579> those<00:02:37.790> pins<00:02:39.040> and<00:02:40.040> you<00:02:40.129> can<00:02:40.250> see<00:02:40.370> the

00:02:40.509 --> 00:02:40.519 
trim down those pins and you can see the

00:02:40.519 --> 00:02:42.190 
trim down those pins and you can see the
handles<00:02:40.819> is<00:02:40.969> square<00:02:41.359> so<00:02:41.629> next<00:02:41.959> we're<00:02:42.049> going<00:02:42.140> to

00:02:42.190 --> 00:02:42.200 
handles is square so next we're going to

00:02:42.200 --> 00:02:43.929 
handles is square so next we're going to
work<00:02:42.409> on<00:02:42.620> that<00:02:42.859> and<00:02:43.040> get<00:02:43.159> into<00:02:43.370> the<00:02:43.489> shape<00:02:43.700> I

00:02:43.929 --> 00:02:43.939 
work on that and get into the shape I

00:02:43.939 --> 00:02:46.000 
work on that and get into the shape I
love<00:02:44.329> using<00:02:44.569> a<00:02:44.750> rasp<00:02:45.019> or<00:02:45.290> wood<00:02:45.500> rasp

00:02:47.949 --> 00:02:47.959 
I just grasp that handle down and keep

00:02:47.959 --> 00:02:50.229 
I just grasp that handle down and keep
working<00:02:48.139> it<00:02:48.439> until<00:02:48.859> it's<00:02:49.219> handle<00:02:49.760> the<00:02:50.030> handle

works<00:02:53.000> pretty<00:02:53.209> good<00:02:53.389> it<00:02:53.480> is<00:02:58.719> and<00:02:59.719> there<00:03:00.049> we<00:03:00.139> go

00:03:00.220 --> 00:03:00.230 
works pretty good it is and there we go

works pretty good it is and there we go
now<00:03:00.260> we<00:03:00.500> can<00:03:00.739> focus<00:03:00.920> on<00:03:01.189> the<00:03:01.340> blade<00:03:02.049> this<00:03:03.049> takes

00:03:03.369 --> 00:03:03.379 
now we can focus on the blade this takes

00:03:03.379 --> 00:03:05.860 
now we can focus on the blade this takes
time<00:03:03.680> and<00:03:04.069> a<00:03:04.159> lot<00:03:04.310> of<00:03:04.340> work<00:03:04.519> but<00:03:04.939> you<00:03:05.000> start

00:03:05.860 --> 00:03:05.870 
time and a lot of work but you start

00:03:05.870 --> 00:03:07.240 
time and a lot of work but you start
polishing<00:03:06.290> up<00:03:06.530> the<00:03:06.620> blade<00:03:06.769> by<00:03:07.010> working

that<00:03:57.290> is<00:03:57.439> now<00:03:57.590> hardened<00:03:59.229> but<00:04:00.229> that<00:04:00.979> is<00:04:01.159> the

00:04:01.300 --> 00:04:01.310 
that is now hardened but that is the

00:04:01.310 --> 00:04:03.339 
that is now hardened but that is the
test<00:04:01.549> to<00:04:01.819> see<00:04:02.060> if<00:04:02.090> it's<00:04:02.329> hardened<00:04:02.689> you<00:04:03.079> want<00:04:03.259> to

00:04:03.339 --> 00:04:03.349 
test to see if it's hardened you want to

00:04:03.349 --> 00:04:04.839 
test to see if it's hardened you want to
file<00:04:03.530> along<00:04:03.859> it<00:04:04.040> and<00:04:04.129> you<00:04:04.220> can<00:04:04.400> hear<00:04:04.669> how<00:04:04.819> it

00:04:04.839 --> 00:04:04.849 
file along it and you can hear how it

00:04:04.849 --> 00:04:08.050 
file along it and you can hear how it
sounds<00:04:05.239> a<00:04:05.780> glass<00:04:06.109> on<00:04:06.500> the<00:04:06.709> blade<00:04:06.979> and<00:04:07.790> on<00:04:07.939> the

00:04:08.050 --> 00:04:08.060 
sounds a glass on the blade and on the

00:04:08.060 --> 00:04:10.240 
sounds a glass on the blade and on the
handle<00:04:08.479> sounds<00:04:08.989> a<00:04:09.049> lot<00:04:09.169> different<00:04:09.229> so<00:04:10.099> you've

00:04:10.240 --> 00:04:10.250 
handle sounds a lot different so you've

00:04:10.250 --> 00:04:11.800 
handle sounds a lot different so you've
know<00:04:10.459> you<00:04:10.519> hardened<00:04:11.060> it<00:04:11.150> you<00:04:11.239> just<00:04:11.389> hear<00:04:11.659> that

00:04:11.800 --> 00:04:11.810 
know you hardened it you just hear that

00:04:11.810 --> 00:04:13.409 
know you hardened it you just hear that
sound

00:04:13.409 --> 00:04:13.419 
sound

00:04:13.419 --> 00:04:16.149 
sound
so<00:04:14.419> now<00:04:14.540> clean<00:04:14.900> that<00:04:15.229> blade<00:04:15.470> up<00:04:15.680> really<00:04:15.979> good

00:04:16.149 --> 00:04:16.159 
so now clean that blade up really good

00:04:16.159 --> 00:04:17.979 
so now clean that blade up really good
get<00:04:16.400> all<00:04:16.519> the<00:04:16.609> scale<00:04:16.880> off<00:04:17.090> of<00:04:17.239> that<00:04:17.359> use<00:04:17.509> we're

00:04:17.979 --> 00:04:17.989 
get all the scale off of that use we're

00:04:17.989 --> 00:04:19.719 
get all the scale off of that use we're
going<00:04:18.019> to<00:04:18.289> temper<00:04:18.769> it<00:04:18.799> which<00:04:19.070> is<00:04:19.220> softens<00:04:19.609> it

00:04:19.719 --> 00:04:19.729 
going to temper it which is softens it

00:04:19.729 --> 00:04:22.330 
going to temper it which is softens it
back<00:04:19.880> up<00:04:20.060> but<00:04:20.180> we<00:04:20.299> need<00:04:20.329> to<00:04:20.690> see<00:04:20.870> the<00:04:21.049> color<00:04:21.340> so

00:04:22.330 --> 00:04:22.340 
back up but we need to see the color so

00:04:22.340 --> 00:04:23.980 
back up but we need to see the color so
we<00:04:22.460> can<00:04:22.580> temper<00:04:22.849> it<00:04:22.970> correctly<00:04:23.330> so<00:04:23.780> you<00:04:23.840> get<00:04:23.960> a

00:04:23.980 --> 00:04:23.990 
we can temper it correctly so you get a

00:04:23.990 --> 00:04:25.210 
we can temper it correctly so you get a
clean<00:04:24.259> that<00:04:24.470> blade<00:04:24.650> until<00:04:24.830> it's<00:04:25.070> nice<00:04:25.190> and

00:04:25.210 --> 00:04:25.220 
clean that blade until it's nice and

00:04:25.220 --> 00:04:29.200 
clean that blade until it's nice and
shiny<00:04:26.139> now<00:04:27.139> put<00:04:27.349> the<00:04:27.500> knife<00:04:27.710> now<00:04:28.580> all<00:04:28.970> we're

00:04:29.200 --> 00:04:29.210 
shiny now put the knife now all we're

00:04:29.210 --> 00:04:31.540 
shiny now put the knife now all we're
focused<00:04:29.570> on<00:04:29.690> here<00:04:29.990> is<00:04:30.020> the<00:04:30.349> blade<00:04:30.650> the<00:04:31.220> cutting

00:04:31.540 --> 00:04:31.550 
focused on here is the blade the cutting

00:04:31.550 --> 00:04:33.399 
focused on here is the blade the cutting

00:04:33.399 --> 00:04:33.409 
edge the cutting part of it put that

00:04:33.409 --> 00:04:35.770 
edge the cutting part of it put that
knife<00:04:33.590> in<00:04:33.860> the<00:04:34.099> near<00:04:34.789> the<00:04:35.030> Forge<00:04:35.270> like<00:04:35.599> this

00:04:35.770 --> 00:04:35.780 
knife in the near the Forge like this

00:04:35.780 --> 00:04:38.170 
knife in the near the Forge like this
near<00:04:36.050> the<00:04:36.080> fire<00:04:36.409> with<00:04:36.889> the<00:04:37.009> spine<00:04:37.400> facing<00:04:38.090> the

00:04:38.180 --> 00:04:41.830 
near the fire with the spine facing the

00:04:41.830 --> 00:04:41.840 
fire you don't put it in the Forge fire

00:04:41.840 --> 00:04:43.450 
fire you don't put it in the Forge fire
we're<00:04:42.020> looking<00:04:42.380> to<00:04:42.560> do<00:04:42.710> something<00:04:43.070> like<00:04:43.190> this

00:04:43.450 --> 00:04:43.460 
we're looking to do something like this

00:04:43.460 --> 00:04:45.970 
we're looking to do something like this
where<00:04:43.820> the<00:04:44.389> cutting<00:04:44.750> edge<00:04:45.050> is<00:04:45.320> a<00:04:45.350> weak<00:04:45.650> color

00:04:45.970 --> 00:04:45.980 
where the cutting edge is a weak color

00:04:45.980 --> 00:04:48.940 
where the cutting edge is a weak color
and<00:04:46.280> the<00:04:46.850> back<00:04:47.090> edge<00:04:47.360> is<00:04:47.389> a<00:04:47.570> plum<00:04:47.870> color<00:04:48.110> what

00:04:48.940 --> 00:04:48.950 
and the back edge is a plum color what

00:04:48.950 --> 00:04:51.250 
and the back edge is a plum color what
that<00:04:49.130> does<00:04:49.370> is<00:04:49.610> it<00:04:49.970> softens<00:04:50.330> the<00:04:50.600> back<00:04:50.780> up<00:04:51.020> more

00:04:51.250 --> 00:04:51.260 
that does is it softens the back up more

00:04:51.260 --> 00:04:54.129 
that does is it softens the back up more
than<00:04:51.590> the<00:04:51.770> edge<00:04:51.919> so<00:04:52.880> you<00:04:52.910> can<00:04:53.180> maintain<00:04:53.630> a<00:04:53.870> nice

00:04:54.129 --> 00:04:54.139 
than the edge so you can maintain a nice

00:04:54.139 --> 00:04:55.780 
than the edge so you can maintain a nice
sharp<00:04:54.500> edge<00:04:54.680> on<00:04:54.860> the<00:04:54.980> blade<00:04:55.190> but<00:04:55.490> the<00:04:55.580> back<00:04:55.760> is

00:04:55.780 --> 00:04:55.790 
sharp edge on the blade but the back is

00:04:55.790 --> 00:04:57.250 
sharp edge on the blade but the back is
soft<00:04:56.240> enough<00:04:56.389> so<00:04:56.600> it<00:04:56.690> has<00:04:56.810> some<00:04:56.930> give<00:04:57.080> to<00:04:57.139> it

00:04:57.250 --> 00:04:57.260 
soft enough so it has some give to it

00:04:57.260 --> 00:04:59.320 
soft enough so it has some give to it
and<00:04:57.710> you<00:04:57.830> can<00:04:57.919> see<00:04:58.070> mine<00:04:58.280> there's<00:04:59.000> a<00:04:59.090> little

00:04:59.320 --> 00:04:59.330 
and you can see mine there's a little

00:04:59.330 --> 00:05:01.000 
and you can see mine there's a little
bit<00:04:59.480> plum<00:04:59.720> colored<00:05:00.050> on<00:05:00.169> the<00:05:00.260> tip<00:05:00.500> too<00:05:00.740> so<00:05:00.980> I

00:05:01.000 --> 00:05:01.010 
bit plum colored on the tip too so I

00:05:01.010 --> 00:05:03.100 
bit plum colored on the tip too so I
over<00:05:01.639> soften<00:05:01.910> this<00:05:02.120> one<00:05:02.300> a<00:05:02.330> little<00:05:02.510> bit<00:05:02.780> but<00:05:02.990> it

00:05:03.100 --> 00:05:03.110 
over soften this one a little bit but it

00:05:03.110 --> 00:05:05.590 
over soften this one a little bit but it
would<00:05:03.200> be<00:05:03.260> okay<00:05:03.610> so<00:05:04.610> move<00:05:04.940> it<00:05:05.060> around<00:05:05.150> however

00:05:05.590 --> 00:05:05.600 
would be okay so move it around however

00:05:05.600 --> 00:05:07.930 
would be okay so move it around however
you<00:05:05.900> need<00:05:06.050> to<00:05:06.280> don't<00:05:07.280> put<00:05:07.430> it<00:05:07.520> too<00:05:07.550> close<00:05:07.639> to

00:05:07.930 --> 00:05:07.940 
you need to don't put it too close to

00:05:07.940 --> 00:05:09.909 
you need to don't put it too close to
the<00:05:08.030> fire<00:05:08.270> and<00:05:08.600> then<00:05:09.169> once<00:05:09.380> it<00:05:09.530> gets<00:05:09.680> to<00:05:09.770> the

00:05:09.909 --> 00:05:09.919 
the fire and then once it gets to the

00:05:09.919 --> 00:05:12.040 
the fire and then once it gets to the
right<00:05:10.070> color<00:05:10.460> temperature<00:05:11.060> dip<00:05:11.750> it<00:05:11.870> in<00:05:11.960> the

00:05:12.040 --> 00:05:12.050 
right color temperature dip it in the

00:06:47.270 --> 00:06:50.559 
snug you can't get them to fit well you
can<00:06:47.419> sand<00:06:47.630> them<00:06:47.810> a<00:06:47.870> little<00:06:48.110> bit<00:06:49.090> so<00:06:50.090> pin<00:06:50.330> all<00:06:50.479> of

00:06:50.559 --> 00:06:50.569 
can sand them a little bit so pin all of

00:06:50.569 --> 00:06:56.559 
can sand them a little bit so pin all of
that<00:06:50.690> down<00:06:53.349> and<00:06:54.819> here's<00:06:55.819> my<00:06:56.000> extra<00:06:56.360> piece<00:06:56.539> of

down and try not to clamp on the pins

00:07:13.090 --> 00:07:16.029 
down and try not to clamp on the pins
then<00:07:14.090> let<00:07:14.330> it<00:07:14.449> set<00:07:14.690> overnight<00:07:14.960> horville<00:07:15.949> is
