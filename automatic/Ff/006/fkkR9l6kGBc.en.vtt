00:01:32.620 --> 00:01:32.630 
quickly and very fast-paced and where

00:01:32.630 --> 00:01:34.420 
quickly and very fast-paced and where
it's<00:01:32.810> over<00:01:33.140> after<00:01:33.740> the<00:01:33.890> new<00:01:34.040> layer<00:01:34.190> match

00:01:34.420 --> 00:01:34.430

00:01:34.430 --> 00:01:36.850 
it's over after the new layer match
after<00:01:34.640> five<00:01:34.880> minutes<00:01:35.090> or<00:01:35.270> so<00:01:35.420> and<00:01:35.600> nearly<00:01:36.560> and

00:01:36.850 --> 00:01:36.860 
after five minutes or so and nearly and

00:01:36.860 --> 00:01:39.400 
after five minutes or so and nearly and
then<00:01:37.040> really<00:01:37.400> every<00:01:37.640> match<00:01:37.820> one<00:01:38.240> team<00:01:38.930> spawn

00:01:39.400 --> 00:01:39.410 
then really every match one team spawn

00:01:39.410 --> 00:01:43.090 
then really every match one team spawn
rapes<00:01:39.680> the<00:01:39.890> other<00:01:40.100> chain<00:01:41.770> that's<00:01:42.770> really

00:01:43.090 --> 00:01:43.100 
rapes the other chain that's really

00:01:43.100 --> 00:01:45.520

multiple<00:04:57.240> not<00:04:57.569> i<00:04:57.900> mean<00:04:57.960> i<00:04:58.349> can't<00:04:59.250> play<00:04:59.310> it<00:04:59.430> for

00:04:59.809 --> 00:04:59.819 
multiple not i mean i can't play it for

00:04:59.819 --> 00:05:02.059 
multiple not i mean i can't play it for
a<00:05:00.150> few<00:05:00.599> rounds<00:05:00.780> and<00:05:01.110> then<00:05:01.289> i<00:05:01.319> have<00:05:01.590> to<00:05:01.770> play

00:05:02.059 --> 00:05:02.069 
a few rounds and then i have to play

00:05:02.069 --> 00:05:04.760 
a few rounds and then i have to play
something<00:05:02.460> else<00:05:02.580> because<00:05:03.020> it<00:05:04.020> gets<00:05:04.259> all<00:05:04.560> very

00:05:04.760 --> 00:05:04.770 
something else because it gets all very

00:05:04.770 --> 00:05:09.189 
something else because it gets all very
quickly<00:05:05.069> and<00:05:05.569> also<00:05:06.650> there<00:05:07.650> are<00:05:07.680> just<00:05:08.099> like

00:05:09.189 --> 00:05:09.199 
quickly and also there are just like

00:05:09.199 --> 00:05:12.350 
quickly and also there are just like
five<00:05:10.199> or<00:05:10.500> four<00:05:10.770> maps<00:05:10.979> and<00:05:11.370> it<00:05:11.880> all<00:05:12.060> i<00:05:12.090> think

00:05:12.350 --> 00:05:12.360 
five or four maps and it all i think

00:05:12.360 --> 00:05:13.730 
five or four maps and it all i think
there<00:05:12.569> were<00:05:12.630> eight<00:05:12.840> maps<00:05:13.110> if<00:05:13.380> you<00:05:13.500> want<00:05:13.680> to

00:05:13.730 --> 00:05:13.740 
there were eight maps if you want to

00:05:13.740 --> 00:05:16.969 
there were eight maps if you want to
know<00:05:13.830> that<00:05:14.039> them<00:05:14.539> but<00:05:15.539> you<00:05:16.050> can't<00:05:16.080> play<00:05:16.620> every

00:05:16.969 --> 00:05:16.979 
know that them but you can't play every

00:05:16.979 --> 00:05:19.700 
know that them but you can't play every
map<00:05:17.220> in<00:05:17.430> every<00:05:17.639> game<00:05:17.759> mode<00:05:18.000> and<00:05:18.240> so<00:05:18.710> that's

00:05:19.700 --> 00:05:19.710 
map in every game mode and so that's

00:05:19.710 --> 00:05:21.320 
map in every game mode and so that's
also<00:05:19.889> knowing<00:05:20.250> so<00:05:20.460> they're<00:05:20.639> not<00:05:20.819> men<00:05:21.150> enough

00:05:21.320 --> 00:05:21.330 
also knowing so they're not men enough

00:05:21.330 --> 00:05:23.270 
also knowing so they're not men enough
maps<00:05:21.840> the<00:05:22.110> maps<00:05:22.139> are<00:05:22.440> too<00:05:22.590> small<00:05:22.830> and<00:05:23.099> that's

00:05:23.270 --> 00:05:23.280 
maps the maps are too small and that's

00:05:23.280 --> 00:05:24.860 
maps the maps are too small and that's
the<00:05:23.639> biggest<00:05:23.849> issue<00:05:24.090> for<00:05:24.360> me<00:05:24.539> for<00:05:24.840> the

00:05:24.860 --> 00:05:24.870 
the biggest issue for me for the

00:05:24.870 --> 00:05:27.170
