let<00:01:37.020> them<00:01:37.200> have<00:01:37.770> that<00:01:37.799> variation<00:01:38.400> by<00:01:38.490> about

00:01:38.630 --> 00:01:38.640 
let them have that variation by about

00:01:38.640 --> 00:01:40.520 
let them have that variation by about
five<00:01:38.909> degrees<00:01:39.119> you'll<00:01:39.570> get<00:01:39.689> bear<00:01:40.020> tricep

00:01:40.520 --> 00:01:40.530 
five degrees you'll get bear tricep

00:01:40.530 --> 00:01:42.289 
five degrees you'll get bear tricep
activation<00:01:41.100> and<00:01:41.250> play<00:01:41.700> with<00:01:41.820> your<00:01:41.909> angles<00:01:42.210> go

arm chest press this was in the study

00:02:30.180 --> 00:02:32.210 
arm chest press this was in the study
that's<00:02:30.480> actually<00:02:30.990> activating<00:02:31.740> your<00:02:31.800> triceps

00:02:32.210 --> 00:02:32.220 
that's actually activating your triceps

00:02:32.220 --> 00:02:34.730 
that's actually activating your triceps
more<00:02:32.850> than<00:02:32.970> a<00:02:33.030> lot<00:02:33.270> of<00:02:33.330> standard<00:02:33.990> tricep

00:02:38.730 --> 00:02:40.160 
press simply because doing it one arm
you're<00:02:38.880> forced<00:02:39.240> to<00:02:39.330> have<00:02:39.360> to<00:02:39.690> stabilize<00:02:39.900> the

00:02:41.690 --> 00:02:45.380 
dumbbell at the top of the movement
primarily<00:02:42.690> with<00:02:43.200> the<00:02:43.230> entire<00:02:43.770> triceps<00:02:44.490> so<00:02:45.300> I

00:02:45.380 --> 00:02:45.390 
primarily with the entire triceps so I

00:02:45.390 --> 00:02:46.700 
primarily with the entire triceps so I
want<00:02:45.600> to<00:02:45.660> break<00:02:45.810> that<00:02:45.840> a<00:02:45.960> little<00:02:46.170> more<00:02:46.260> science

00:02:46.700 --> 00:02:46.710 
want to break that a little more science

00:02:46.710 --> 00:02:48.440 
want to break that a little more science
of<00:02:46.830> it<00:02:46.950> and<00:02:47.130> just<00:02:47.490> go<00:02:47.670> into<00:02:47.850> some<00:02:48.000> some<00:02:48.240> notes

00:02:48.440 --> 00:02:48.450 
of it and just go into some some notes

00:02:48.450 --> 00:02:50.090 
of it and just go into some some notes
here<00:02:48.540> essentially<00:02:49.440> what<00:02:49.590> you<00:02:49.680> want<00:02:49.860> to<00:02:49.920> do<00:02:49.980> for

00:02:50.090 --> 00:02:50.100 
here essentially what you want to do for

00:02:50.100 --> 00:02:52.280 
here essentially what you want to do for
your<00:02:50.250> tricep<00:02:50.760> development<00:02:51.480> is<00:02:51.600> tricep<00:02:52.200> is

00:02:52.280 --> 00:02:52.290 
your tricep development is tricep is

00:02:52.290 --> 00:02:55.190 
your tricep development is tricep is
more<00:02:52.470> of<00:02:52.530> a<00:02:52.590> fast<00:02:52.890> twitch<00:02:53.250> dominant<00:02:53.910> muscle<00:02:54.840> so

00:02:55.190 --> 00:02:55.200 
more of a fast twitch dominant muscle so

00:02:55.200 --> 00:02:56.480 
more of a fast twitch dominant muscle so
therefore<00:02:55.380> you<00:02:55.620> have<00:02:55.830> to<00:02:55.860> hit<00:02:56.130> it<00:02:56.160> with<00:02:56.340> rep

00:02:56.480 --> 00:02:56.490 
therefore you have to hit it with rep

00:02:56.490 --> 00:02:58.250 
therefore you have to hit it with rep
ranges<00:02:56.790> about<00:02:57.060> four<00:02:57.360> to<00:02:57.480> six<00:02:57.510> that<00:02:58.020> should<00:02:58.200> be

00:02:58.250 --> 00:02:58.260 
ranges about four to six that should be

00:02:58.260 --> 00:03:01.370 
ranges about four to six that should be
primarily<00:02:58.800> where<00:02:59.070> your<00:02:59.790> arm<00:03:00.120> training<00:03:00.750> occurs

00:03:01.370 --> 00:03:01.380 
primarily where your arm training occurs

00:03:01.380 --> 00:03:03.560 
primarily where your arm training occurs
if<00:03:01.770> we're<00:03:01.980> doing<00:03:02.100> anything<00:03:02.280> higher<00:03:02.910> higher

00:03:03.560 --> 00:03:03.570 
if we're doing anything higher higher

00:03:03.570 --> 00:03:05.060 
if we're doing anything higher higher
ups<00:03:03.810> amounts<00:03:04.110> are<00:03:04.230> good<00:03:04.410> for<00:03:04.560> pump<00:03:04.860> they're

00:03:05.060 --> 00:03:05.070 
ups amounts are good for pump they're

00:03:05.070 --> 00:03:06.650 
ups amounts are good for pump they're
good<00:03:05.220> to<00:03:05.310> facilitate<00:03:05.790> blood<00:03:06.030> but<00:03:06.480> for<00:03:06.600> the
