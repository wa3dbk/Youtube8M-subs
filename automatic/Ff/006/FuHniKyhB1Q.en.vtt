do different from most everybody else on
tour<00:00:21.330> on<00:00:21.779> any<00:00:22.080> tour<00:00:22.289> is<00:00:22.800> the<00:00:23.550> way<00:00:23.670> I<00:00:23.699> use<00:00:23.939> the

00:00:23.960 --> 00:00:23.970 
tour on any tour is the way I use the

00:00:23.970 --> 00:00:26.990 
tour on any tour is the way I use the
line<00:00:24.330> I<00:00:24.359> always<00:00:24.779> use<00:00:24.930> a<00:00:24.960> line<00:00:25.640> but<00:00:26.640> the<00:00:26.760> biggest

00:00:26.990 --> 00:00:27.000 
line I always use a line but the biggest

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:29.359 
line I always use a line but the biggest
problem<00:00:27.599> with<00:00:27.720> the<00:00:27.869> line<00:00:28.050> of<00:00:28.080> the<00:00:28.289> ball<00:00:28.529> is

00:00:29.359 --> 00:00:29.369 
problem with the line of the ball is

00:00:29.369 --> 00:00:31.189 
problem with the line of the ball is
when<00:00:29.580> you<00:00:29.670> put<00:00:29.910> it<00:00:30.000> down<00:00:30.029> and<00:00:30.570> you<00:00:30.660> line<00:00:31.050> the

00:00:31.189 --> 00:00:31.199 
when you put it down and you line the

00:00:31.199 --> 00:00:33.950 
when you put it down and you line the
ball<00:00:31.380> up<00:00:31.410> you're<00:00:31.740> kind<00:00:31.949> of<00:00:32.040> stuck<00:00:32.690> so<00:00:33.690> what<00:00:33.930> I

00:00:33.950 --> 00:00:33.960 
ball up you're kind of stuck so what I

00:00:33.960 --> 00:00:36.110 
ball up you're kind of stuck so what I
do<00:00:34.110> that's<00:00:34.410> a<00:00:34.530> little<00:00:34.710> different<00:00:35.130> is<00:00:35.280> I<00:00:35.579> line

00:00:36.110 --> 00:00:36.120 
do that's a little different is I line

00:00:36.120 --> 00:00:39.200 
do that's a little different is I line
every<00:00:36.420> ball<00:00:36.660> up<00:00:36.899> right<00:00:37.140> at<00:00:37.320> the<00:00:37.500> hole<00:00:37.710> and<00:00:38.210> then

00:00:39.200 --> 00:00:39.210 
every ball up right at the hole and then

00:00:39.210 --> 00:00:41.810 
every ball up right at the hole and then
I<00:00:39.360> I've<00:00:39.870> set<00:00:40.200> my<00:00:40.350> putter<00:00:40.680> I<00:00:40.829> use<00:00:40.980> my<00:00:41.160> feel<00:00:41.489> and

00:00:41.810 --> 00:00:41.820 
I I've set my putter I use my feel and

00:00:41.820 --> 00:00:45.650 
I I've set my putter I use my feel and
my<00:00:42.290> intuition<00:00:43.290> to<00:00:44.280> set<00:00:44.520> the<00:00:44.640> putter<00:00:44.879> up<00:00:44.969> and

00:00:45.650 --> 00:00:45.660 
my intuition to set the putter up and

00:00:45.660 --> 00:00:48.110 
my intuition to set the putter up and
play<00:00:45.989> the<00:00:46.020> breakout<00:00:46.530> once<00:00:46.770> so<00:00:47.129> that's<00:00:47.820> how<00:00:48.090> I

00:00:48.110 --> 00:00:48.120 
play the breakout once so that's how I

00:00:48.120 --> 00:00:50.170 
play the breakout once so that's how I
do<00:00:48.329> it<00:00:48.450> really<00:00:48.780> differently<00:00:49.200> which<00:00:49.469> helps<00:00:49.860> me

00:00:50.170 --> 00:00:50.180 
do it really differently which helps me

00:00:50.180 --> 00:00:52.880 
do it really differently which helps me
now<00:00:51.180> that<00:00:51.390> I<00:00:51.420> have<00:00:51.629> the<00:00:51.750> line<00:00:51.960> there<00:00:52.289> on<00:00:52.530> the

00:00:52.880 --> 00:00:52.890 
now that I have the line there on the

00:00:52.890 --> 00:00:55.760 
now that I have the line there on the
ball<00:00:53.100> which<00:00:53.340> is<00:00:53.370> I<00:00:53.579> know<00:00:53.640> is<00:00:53.969> dead<00:00:54.180> center<00:00:54.770> now

00:00:55.760 --> 00:00:55.770 
ball which is I know is dead center now

00:00:55.770 --> 00:00:57.020 
ball which is I know is dead center now
I<00:00:55.800> got<00:00:56.039> a<00:00:56.070> putt<00:00:56.309> that's<00:00:56.340> a<00:00:56.610> little<00:00:56.850> bit<00:00:56.940> of

00:00:57.020 --> 00:00:57.030 
I got a putt that's a little bit of

00:00:57.030 --> 00:01:01.130 
I got a putt that's a little bit of
break<00:00:57.329> I<00:00:57.680> set<00:00:58.680> the<00:00:58.829> putter<00:00:59.070> up<00:00:59.160> I<00:00:59.840> get<00:01:00.840> in<00:01:00.960> here

00:01:01.130 --> 00:01:01.140 
break I set the putter up I get in here

00:01:01.140 --> 00:01:03.950 
break I set the putter up I get in here
I<00:01:01.170> use<00:01:01.410> my<00:01:01.620> feel<00:01:01.980> of<00:01:02.160> my<00:01:02.280> touch<00:01:02.780> and<00:01:03.780> my

00:01:03.950 --> 00:01:03.960 
I use my feel of my touch and my

00:01:03.960 --> 00:01:05.690 
I use my feel of my touch and my
intuition<00:01:04.140> is<00:01:04.559> said<00:01:04.799> the<00:01:04.979> putter<00:01:05.250> up<00:01:05.339> to<00:01:05.580> where

00:01:05.690 --> 00:01:05.700 
intuition is said the putter up to where

00:01:05.700 --> 00:01:09.500 
intuition is said the putter up to where
I<00:01:05.729> think<00:01:05.850> it<00:01:06.240> should<00:01:06.390> be<00:01:08.240> that's<00:01:09.240> very

00:01:09.500 --> 00:01:09.510 
I think it should be that's very

00:01:09.510 --> 00:01:10.730 
I think it should be that's very
interesting<00:01:09.689> one<00:01:09.990> time<00:01:10.229> you<00:01:10.350> come<00:01:10.530> up<00:01:10.590> with

00:01:10.730 --> 00:01:10.740 
interesting one time you come up with

00:01:10.740 --> 00:01:12.830 
interesting one time you come up with
this<00:01:10.890> where<00:01:11.400> everyone's<00:01:11.850> taking<00:01:12.540> so<00:01:12.720> much

00:01:12.830 --> 00:01:12.840 
this where everyone's taking so much

00:01:12.840 --> 00:01:14.719 
this where everyone's taking so much
time<00:01:13.080> to<00:01:13.260> put<00:01:13.409> that<00:01:13.590> line<00:01:13.830> right<00:01:14.280> on<00:01:14.310> what<00:01:14.610> they

00:01:14.719 --> 00:01:14.729 
time to put that line right on what they

00:01:14.729 --> 00:01:16.969 
time to put that line right on what they
think<00:01:15.000> to<00:01:15.119> be<00:01:15.240> the<00:01:15.479> putting<00:01:15.930> line<00:01:16.080> and<00:01:16.710> you<00:01:16.830> put

00:01:16.969 --> 00:01:16.979 
think to be the putting line and you put

00:01:16.979 --> 00:01:18.080 
think to be the putting line and you put
any<00:01:17.100> first<00:01:17.250> of<00:01:17.369> all<00:01:17.460> I've<00:01:17.549> never<00:01:17.670> heard<00:01:17.909> anyone

00:01:18.080 --> 00:01:18.090 
any first of all I've never heard anyone

00:01:18.090 --> 00:01:20.690 
any first of all I've never heard anyone
send<00:01:18.390> it<00:01:18.479> exactly<00:01:19.320> and<00:01:19.530> it's<00:01:20.009> helped<00:01:20.310> me<00:01:20.430> so

00:01:20.690 --> 00:01:20.700 
send it exactly and it's helped me so

00:01:20.700 --> 00:01:22.880 
send it exactly and it's helped me so
much<00:01:20.939> because<00:01:21.840> what<00:01:22.259> happens<00:01:22.619> when<00:01:22.770> you're

00:01:22.880 --> 00:01:22.890 
much because what happens when you're

00:01:22.890 --> 00:01:24.230 
much because what happens when you're
always<00:01:23.009> putting<00:01:23.310> that<00:01:23.430> ball<00:01:23.610> on<00:01:23.670> the<00:01:23.790> line<00:01:24.030> you

00:01:24.230 --> 00:01:24.240 
always putting that ball on the line you

00:01:24.240 --> 00:01:25.700 
always putting that ball on the line you
lose<00:01:24.509> your<00:01:24.750> touch<00:01:24.990> you<00:01:25.170> always<00:01:25.350> line<00:01:25.470> up<00:01:25.500> to

00:01:25.700 --> 00:01:25.710 
lose your touch you always line up to

00:01:25.710 --> 00:01:28.249 
lose your touch you always line up to
that<00:01:25.830> ball<00:01:26.070> and<00:01:26.610> for<00:01:26.850> me<00:01:26.970> being<00:01:27.210> you<00:01:27.900> know<00:01:28.020> it's

00:01:28.249 --> 00:01:28.259 
that ball and for me being you know it's

00:01:28.259 --> 00:01:30.560 
that ball and for me being you know it's
considered<00:01:28.560> kind<00:01:28.740> of<00:01:28.829> a<00:01:28.890> slower<00:01:29.130> player<00:01:29.579> now<00:01:30.540> I

00:01:30.560 --> 00:01:30.570 
considered kind of a slower player now I

00:01:30.570 --> 00:01:32.630 
considered kind of a slower player now I
got<00:01:30.840> to<00:01:30.930> go<00:01:31.079> and<00:01:31.259> reset<00:01:31.650> the<00:01:31.770> line<00:01:31.920> I<00:01:32.250> got<00:01:32.490> it

00:01:32.630 --> 00:01:32.640 
got to go and reset the line I got it

00:01:32.640 --> 00:01:34.310 
got to go and reset the line I got it
you<00:01:33.119> know<00:01:33.150> or<00:01:33.390> you're<00:01:33.540> just<00:01:33.780> stuck<00:01:34.049> in<00:01:34.200> that
