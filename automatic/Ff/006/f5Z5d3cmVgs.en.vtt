from the standard battery charger which

00:01:17.340 --> 00:01:20.060 
from the standard battery charger which
will<00:01:17.549> make<00:01:17.670> it<00:01:18.290> just<00:01:19.290> in<00:01:19.380> case<00:01:19.440> is<00:01:19.740> not<00:01:19.830> enough

00:01:20.060 --> 00:01:20.070 
will make it just in case is not enough
