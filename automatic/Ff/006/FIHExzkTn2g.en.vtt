mom used to tell me to put a hat on if
my<00:00:01.800> feet<00:00:02.129> got<00:00:02.310> cold<00:00:05.270> she<00:00:06.270> still<00:00:06.299> does<00:00:06.799> for

my feet got cold she still does for

00:00:07.799 --> 00:00:08.810 
my feet got cold she still does for
years<00:00:07.919> I've<00:00:08.130> heard<00:00:08.309> that<00:00:08.460> you<00:00:08.519> can<00:00:08.670> lose

thirty forty sixty eighty percent of
your<00:00:10.740> body<00:00:10.800> heat<00:00:11.130> out<00:00:11.219> of<00:00:11.309> your<00:00:11.429> head<00:00:11.580> but<00:00:12.240> if

00:00:12.320 --> 00:00:12.330 
your body heat out of your head but if

00:00:12.330 --> 00:00:13.999 
your body heat out of your head but if
you<00:00:12.389> look<00:00:12.540> it<00:00:12.660> up<00:00:12.780> you<00:00:13.469> really<00:00:13.679> don't<00:00:13.830> have<00:00:13.950> to

00:00:13.999 --> 00:00:14.009 
you look it up you really don't have to

00:00:14.009 --> 00:00:16.160 
you look it up you really don't have to
because<00:00:14.340> we<00:00:14.519> just<00:00:14.700> did<00:00:14.940> you'll<00:00:15.719> find<00:00:15.870> out<00:00:16.020> the

00:00:16.160 --> 00:00:16.170 
because we just did you'll find out the

00:00:16.170 --> 00:00:17.540 
because we just did you'll find out the
experts<00:00:16.590> are<00:00:16.710> saying<00:00:16.859> that's<00:00:17.100> just<00:00:17.369> not<00:00:17.520> true

00:00:17.540 --> 00:00:17.550 
experts are saying that's just not true

00:00:17.550 --> 00:00:19.490 
experts are saying that's just not true
the<00:00:18.359> original<00:00:18.720> data<00:00:18.869> comes<00:00:19.080> from<00:00:19.140> a<00:00:19.320> military

00:00:19.490 --> 00:00:19.500 
the original data comes from a military

00:00:19.500 --> 00:00:20.929 
the original data comes from a military
experiment<00:00:20.070> with<00:00:20.369> the<00:00:20.430> guys<00:00:20.550> we're<00:00:20.760> wearing

00:00:20.929 --> 00:00:20.939 
experiment with the guys we're wearing

00:00:20.939 --> 00:00:22.790 
experiment with the guys we're wearing
Arctic<00:00:21.449> suits<00:00:21.689> of<00:00:22.230> course<00:00:22.500> you're<00:00:22.619> going<00:00:22.740> to

00:00:22.790 --> 00:00:22.800 
Arctic suits of course you're going to

00:00:22.800 --> 00:00:24.170 
Arctic suits of course you're going to
lose<00:00:22.890> forty<00:00:23.220> percent<00:00:23.460> your<00:00:23.640> body<00:00:23.850> heat<00:00:24.060> out<00:00:24.150> of

00:00:24.170 --> 00:00:24.180 
lose forty percent your body heat out of

00:00:24.180 --> 00:00:26.890 
lose forty percent your body heat out of
the<00:00:24.300> one<00:00:24.510> place<00:00:24.779> that's<00:00:24.960> exposed<00:00:25.439> your<00:00:26.340> face

00:00:26.890 --> 00:00:26.900 
the one place that's exposed your face

00:00:26.900 --> 00:00:30.019 
the one place that's exposed your face
so<00:00:27.900> just<00:00:28.080> wearing<00:00:28.230> a<00:00:28.380> hat<00:00:28.529> make<00:00:28.710> you<00:00:28.830> warmer<00:00:29.279> of

00:00:30.019 --> 00:00:30.029 
so just wearing a hat make you warmer of

00:00:30.029 --> 00:00:32.150 
so just wearing a hat make you warmer of
course<00:00:30.269> it<00:00:30.449> does<00:00:30.599> will<00:00:31.380> it<00:00:31.470> warm<00:00:31.650> up<00:00:31.740> your<00:00:31.920> feet

00:00:32.150 --> 00:00:32.160 
course it does will it warm up your feet

00:00:32.160 --> 00:00:35.389 
course it does will it warm up your feet
I<00:00:32.690> guess<00:00:33.690> but<00:00:34.500> will<00:00:34.649> it<00:00:34.680> warm<00:00:34.980> up<00:00:35.070> your<00:00:35.219> feet

00:00:35.389 --> 00:00:35.399 
I guess but will it warm up your feet

00:00:35.399 --> 00:00:37.840 
I guess but will it warm up your feet
better<00:00:35.670> than<00:00:35.880> putting<00:00:36.090> on<00:00:36.300> a<00:00:36.329> pair<00:00:36.630> of<00:00:36.719> socks<00:00:37.050> I

00:00:37.840 --> 00:00:37.850 
better than putting on a pair of socks I

00:00:37.850 --> 00:00:41.869 
better than putting on a pair of socks I
really<00:00:38.850> doubt<00:00:39.000> it<00:00:40.399> traditional<00:00:41.399> rumors<00:00:41.670> say

00:00:41.869 --> 00:00:41.879 
really doubt it traditional rumors say

00:00:41.879 --> 00:00:44.000 
really doubt it traditional rumors say
yes<00:00:42.090> but<00:00:42.420> scientific<00:00:43.020> experiments<00:00:43.620> say<00:00:43.800> no

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:44.010 
yes but scientific experiments say no

00:00:44.010 --> 00:00:46.810 
yes but scientific experiments say no
what<00:00:44.640> you<00:00:44.760> ought<00:00:44.940> to<00:00:45.059> know<00:00:45.120> is<00:00:45.420> the<00:00:45.750> facts

00:00:46.810 --> 00:00:46.820 
what you ought to know is the facts

00:00:46.820 --> 00:00:48.799 
what you ought to know is the facts
getting<00:00:47.820> cold<00:00:48.059> as<00:00:48.210> mostly<00:00:48.570> to<00:00:48.660> do<00:00:48.780> with

00:00:48.799 --> 00:00:48.809 
getting cold as mostly to do with

00:00:48.809 --> 00:00:51.139 
getting cold as mostly to do with
surface<00:00:49.289> area<00:00:49.620> meaning<00:00:50.370> the<00:00:50.610> more<00:00:50.820> of<00:00:50.910> you<00:00:51.030> is

00:00:51.139 --> 00:00:51.149 
surface area meaning the more of you is

00:00:51.149 --> 00:00:52.729 
surface area meaning the more of you is
exposed<00:00:51.600> to<00:00:51.870> the<00:00:52.020> colder<00:00:52.320> you're<00:00:52.469> going<00:00:52.649> to

00:00:52.729 --> 00:00:52.739 
exposed to the colder you're going to

00:00:52.739 --> 00:00:54.410 
exposed to the colder you're going to
get<00:00:52.890> but<00:00:53.460> when<00:00:53.550> you<00:00:53.640> get<00:00:53.760> cold<00:00:53.940> your<00:00:54.180> body's

00:00:54.410 --> 00:00:54.420 
get but when you get cold your body's

00:00:54.420 --> 00:00:56.150 
get but when you get cold your body's
natural<00:00:54.570> reaction<00:00:55.260> is<00:00:55.320> to<00:00:55.379> try<00:00:55.649> and<00:00:55.680> stay<00:00:55.920> warm

00:00:56.150 --> 00:00:56.160 
natural reaction is to try and stay warm

00:00:56.160 --> 00:00:58.010 
natural reaction is to try and stay warm
in<00:00:56.370> the<00:00:56.430> most<00:00:56.610> important<00:00:57.030> places<00:00:57.239> so<00:00:57.960> it

00:00:58.010 --> 00:00:58.020 
in the most important places so it

00:00:58.020 --> 00:00:59.090 
in the most important places so it
restricts<00:00:58.379> the<00:00:58.469> blood<00:00:58.680> flow<00:00:58.949> to<00:00:58.980> your

00:00:59.090 --> 00:00:59.100 
restricts the blood flow to your

00:00:59.100 --> 00:01:01.189 
restricts the blood flow to your
capillaries<00:00:59.820> and<00:00:59.850> your<00:01:00.090> arms<00:01:00.270> and<00:01:00.420> legs<00:01:00.629> to

00:01:01.189 --> 00:01:01.199 
capillaries and your arms and legs to

00:01:01.199 --> 00:01:02.889 
capillaries and your arms and legs to
try<00:01:01.350> and<00:01:01.469> keep<00:01:01.559> your<00:01:01.680> head<00:01:01.739> and<00:01:01.949> torso<00:01:02.100> warm

00:01:02.889 --> 00:01:02.899 
try and keep your head and torso warm

00:01:02.899 --> 00:01:06.469 
try and keep your head and torso warm
snuggly<00:01:03.899> warm<00:01:04.640> how<00:01:05.640> fast<00:01:05.880> you<00:01:06.000> lose<00:01:06.150> heat<00:01:06.360> is

00:01:06.469 --> 00:01:06.479 
snuggly warm how fast you lose heat is

00:01:06.479 --> 00:01:07.760 
snuggly warm how fast you lose heat is
also<00:01:06.689> going<00:01:06.810> to<00:01:06.869> be<00:01:06.960> directly<00:01:07.290> affected<00:01:07.470> by

00:01:07.760 --> 00:01:07.770 
also going to be directly affected by

00:01:07.770 --> 00:01:09.350 
also going to be directly affected by
how<00:01:07.979> close<00:01:08.310> to<00:01:08.340> the<00:01:08.580> surface<00:01:08.790> your<00:01:09.119> blood

00:01:09.350 --> 00:01:09.360 
how close to the surface your blood

00:01:09.360 --> 00:01:11.000 
how close to the surface your blood
actually<00:01:09.600> is<00:01:09.960> if<00:01:10.560> you<00:01:10.680> have<00:01:10.710> a<00:01:10.799> nice

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:11.010 
actually is if you have a nice

00:01:11.010 --> 00:01:12.560 
actually is if you have a nice
insulating<00:01:11.610> layer<00:01:11.760> of<00:01:11.939> fat<00:01:12.090> between<00:01:12.450> your

00:01:12.560 --> 00:01:12.570 
insulating layer of fat between your

00:01:12.570 --> 00:01:14.270 
insulating layer of fat between your
veins<00:01:12.810> and<00:01:13.049> the<00:01:13.080> cold<00:01:13.350> cruel<00:01:13.619> world<00:01:13.680> outside

00:01:14.270 --> 00:01:14.280 
veins and the cold cruel world outside

00:01:14.280 --> 00:01:16.550 
veins and the cold cruel world outside
your<00:01:14.490> skin<00:01:14.760> you'll<00:01:15.270> stay<00:01:15.450> a<00:01:15.479> lot<00:01:15.659> warmer<00:01:15.840> now

00:01:16.550 --> 00:01:16.560 
your skin you'll stay a lot warmer now

00:01:16.560 --> 00:01:17.780 
your skin you'll stay a lot warmer now
you're<00:01:16.710> facing<00:01:16.920> your<00:01:17.159> head<00:01:17.369> have<00:01:17.549> a<00:01:17.610> lot<00:01:17.759> of

00:01:17.780 --> 00:01:17.790 
you're facing your head have a lot of

00:01:17.790 --> 00:01:19.160 
you're facing your head have a lot of
blood<00:01:18.030> running<00:01:18.330> through<00:01:18.509> them<00:01:18.600> and<00:01:18.750> there

00:01:19.160 --> 00:01:19.170 
blood running through them and there

00:01:19.170 --> 00:01:21.710 
blood running through them and there
isn't<00:01:19.439> much<00:01:19.590> insulating<00:01:20.430> fat<00:01:20.759> there<00:01:21.090> so<00:01:21.659> you

00:01:21.710 --> 00:01:21.720 
isn't much insulating fat there so you

00:01:21.720 --> 00:01:23.270 
isn't much insulating fat there so you
could<00:01:21.869> argue<00:01:22.110> that<00:01:22.320> you<00:01:22.560> lose<00:01:22.710> a<00:01:22.740> lot<00:01:22.979> of<00:01:23.100> heat

00:01:23.270 --> 00:01:23.280 
could argue that you lose a lot of heat

00:01:23.280 --> 00:01:26.719 
could argue that you lose a lot of heat
through<00:01:23.460> your<00:01:23.610> head<00:01:24.080> because<00:01:25.080> you<00:01:25.200> do<00:01:25.640> but<00:01:26.640> if

00:01:26.719 --> 00:01:26.729 
through your head because you do but if

00:01:26.729 --> 00:01:27.859 
through your head because you do but if
you<00:01:26.820> want<00:01:26.970> to<00:01:27.030> argue<00:01:27.180> we<00:01:27.450> can<00:01:27.600> argue<00:01:27.720> about

00:01:27.859 --> 00:01:27.869 
you want to argue we can argue about

00:01:27.869 --> 00:01:30.350 
you want to argue we can argue about
pretty<00:01:28.320> much<00:01:28.409> anything<00:01:28.619> I<00:01:29.150> guess<00:01:30.150> in<00:01:30.240> the<00:01:30.329> end

00:01:30.350 --> 00:01:30.360 
pretty much anything I guess in the end

00:01:30.360 --> 00:01:32.179 
pretty much anything I guess in the end
the<00:01:30.570> points<00:01:30.869> this<00:01:31.110> if<00:01:31.560> something's<00:01:31.950> cold

00:01:32.179 --> 00:01:32.189 
the points this if something's cold

00:01:32.189 --> 00:01:34.850
