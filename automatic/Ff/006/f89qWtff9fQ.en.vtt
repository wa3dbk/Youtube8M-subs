stick into the playing surface like with

00:04:06.490 --> 00:04:08.520 
stick into the playing surface like with
the<00:04:06.610> wrist<00:04:06.820> stroke<00:04:07.120> the<00:04:07.540> motion<00:04:07.960> is<00:04:08.110> smooth

00:04:08.520 --> 00:04:08.530 
the wrist stroke the motion is smooth

00:04:08.530 --> 00:04:20.880 
the wrist stroke the motion is smooth
and<00:04:08.830> unforced<00:04:16.680> as<00:04:18.540> you<00:04:19.540> can<00:04:19.720> see<00:04:19.930> it's<00:04:20.650> just

00:04:20.880 --> 00:04:20.890 
and unforced as you can see it's just

00:04:20.890 --> 00:04:22.320 
and unforced as you can see it's just
another<00:04:21.100> way<00:04:21.310> of<00:04:21.340> setting<00:04:21.880> the<00:04:22.000> height<00:04:22.180> of

00:04:22.320 --> 00:04:22.330 
another way of setting the height of

00:04:22.330 --> 00:04:24.900 
another way of setting the height of
rise<00:04:22.510> of<00:04:22.780> the<00:04:23.110> accented<00:04:23.680> notes<00:04:23.710> apart<00:04:24.610> from

00:04:24.900 --> 00:04:24.910 
rise of the accented notes apart from

rise of the accented notes apart from
the<00:04:25.030> inner<00:04:25.180> notes<00:04:25.420> this<00:04:26.350> technique<00:04:26.800> may<00:04:27.160> help

00:04:27.450 --> 00:04:27.460 
the inner notes this technique may help

00:04:27.460 --> 00:04:29.490 
the inner notes this technique may help
you<00:04:27.580> increase<00:04:28.030> the<00:04:28.180> tempo<00:04:28.510> of<00:04:28.660> many<00:04:28.930> passages

00:04:29.490 --> 00:04:29.500 
you increase the tempo of many passages

00:04:29.500 --> 00:04:31.770 
you increase the tempo of many passages
without<00:04:29.950> tensing<00:04:30.250> up<00:04:30.580> you'll<00:04:31.540> probably

00:04:31.770 --> 00:04:31.780 
without tensing up you'll probably

00:04:31.780 --> 00:04:33.210 
without tensing up you'll probably
notice<00:04:32.140> me<00:04:32.440> using<00:04:32.740> this<00:04:32.830> technique

00:04:33.210 --> 00:04:33.220 
notice me using this technique

00:04:33.220 --> 00:04:35.430 
notice me using this technique
frequently<00:04:33.850> as<00:04:34.000> I<00:04:34.090> demonstrate<00:04:34.570> things<00:04:34.810> it's

00:04:35.430 --> 00:04:35.440 
frequently as I demonstrate things it's

00:04:35.440 --> 00:04:37.290 
frequently as I demonstrate things it's
something<00:04:35.770> I<00:04:35.860> feel<00:04:36.010> comfortable<00:04:36.220> with<00:04:36.520> you

00:04:37.290 --> 00:04:37.300 
something I feel comfortable with you

00:04:37.300 --> 00:04:40.020 
something I feel comfortable with you
can<00:04:37.510> try<00:04:37.720> it<00:04:37.780> and<00:04:38.080> if<00:04:38.650> it's<00:04:38.800> not<00:04:38.950> working<00:04:39.190> go

00:04:40.020 --> 00:04:40.030 
can try it and if it's not working go

00:04:40.030 --> 00:04:43.260 
can try it and if it's not working go
back<00:04:40.240> to<00:04:40.450> the<00:04:40.540> pure<00:04:40.750> wrist<00:04:40.990> stroke
