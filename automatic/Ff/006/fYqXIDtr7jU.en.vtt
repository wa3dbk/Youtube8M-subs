splashing<00:02:46.920> and<00:02:47.040> all<00:02:47.130> the<00:02:47.220> particles<00:02:47.550> coming

00:02:47.990 --> 00:02:48.000 
splashing and all the particles coming

00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:50.090 
splashing and all the particles coming
back<00:02:48.210> down<00:02:48.420> and<00:02:48.690> all<00:02:48.750> that<00:02:48.930> it<00:02:49.320> stops<00:02:49.680> at<00:02:49.860> frame

00:02:50.090 --> 00:02:50.100 
back down and all that it stops at frame

00:02:50.100 --> 00:02:54.199 
back down and all that it stops at frame
100<00:02:50.640> so<00:02:51.300> go<00:02:51.450> down<00:02:51.600> here<00:02:52.250> too<00:02:53.250> well<00:02:53.790> first<00:02:54.060> I'm

00:02:54.199 --> 00:02:54.209 
100 so go down here too well first I'm

00:02:54.209 --> 00:02:56.780 
100 so go down here too well first I'm
going<00:02:54.330> to<00:02:54.390> do<00:02:54.810> this<00:02:55.050> give<00:02:55.620> you<00:02:55.830> a<00:02:55.860> big<00:02:56.190> view<00:02:56.580> by

00:02:56.780 --> 00:02:56.790 
going to do this give you a big view by

00:02:56.790 --> 00:02:59.240 
going to do this give you a big view by
clicking<00:02:56.850> this<00:02:57.300> button<00:02:57.510> down<00:02:57.840> here<00:02:57.870> and<00:02:58.290> then

00:02:59.240 --> 00:02:59.250 
clicking this button down here and then

00:02:59.250 --> 00:03:01.910 
clicking this button down here and then
I'm<00:02:59.430> going<00:02:59.640> to<00:02:59.760> click<00:03:00.030> time<00:03:00.990> configuration

00:03:01.910 --> 00:03:01.920 
I'm going to click time configuration

00:03:01.920 --> 00:03:06.760 
I'm going to click time configuration
and<00:03:02.730> I'm<00:03:03.690> going<00:03:03.959> to<00:03:03.990> change<00:03:04.290> the<00:03:04.530> length<00:03:04.830> to

00:03:06.760 --> 00:03:06.770 
and I'm going to change the length to

00:03:06.770 --> 00:03:12.830 
and I'm going to change the length to
200<00:03:07.770> and<00:03:09.410> then<00:03:10.410> n<00:03:10.650> time<00:03:11.300> or<00:03:12.300> well<00:03:12.660> yeah

00:03:12.830 --> 00:03:12.840 
200 and then n time or well yeah

00:03:12.840 --> 00:03:14.330 
200 and then n time or well yeah
everything<00:03:13.290> actually<00:03:13.470> works<00:03:13.860> like<00:03:14.040> that<00:03:14.070> now

00:03:14.330 --> 00:03:14.340 
everything actually works like that now

00:03:14.340 --> 00:03:18.470 
everything actually works like that now
but<00:03:15.000> now<00:03:15.180> you<00:03:15.240> can<00:03:15.540> see<00:03:16.700> it<00:03:17.700> goes<00:03:17.970> all<00:03:18.239> the<00:03:18.269> way

00:03:18.470 --> 00:03:18.480 
but now you can see it goes all the way

00:03:18.480 --> 00:03:22.490 
but now you can see it goes all the way
to<00:03:18.540> the<00:03:18.750> end<00:03:18.870> of<00:03:18.989> simulation<00:03:20.690> but<00:03:21.690> if<00:03:21.930> you<00:03:22.470> zoom

00:03:22.490 --> 00:03:22.500 
to the end of simulation but if you zoom

00:03:22.500 --> 00:03:24.320 
to the end of simulation but if you zoom
in<00:03:22.920> you'll<00:03:23.160> notice<00:03:23.459> that<00:03:23.489> you<00:03:23.940> get<00:03:24.120> all<00:03:24.209> these

00:03:24.320 --> 00:03:24.330 
in you'll notice that you get all these

00:03:24.330 --> 00:03:27.140 
in you'll notice that you get all these
little<00:03:24.540> triangles<00:03:24.840> like<00:03:25.440> it's<00:03:25.890> not<00:03:25.980> smooth<00:03:26.489> so

00:03:27.140 --> 00:03:27.150 
little triangles like it's not smooth so

00:03:27.150 --> 00:03:29.620 
little triangles like it's not smooth so
to<00:03:27.209> do<00:03:27.570> that<00:03:27.600> go<00:03:27.810> over<00:03:28.019> the<00:03:28.230> modifiers<00:03:28.709> tab

00:03:29.620 --> 00:03:29.630 
to do that go over the modifiers tab

00:03:29.630 --> 00:03:32.600 
to do that go over the modifiers tab
type<00:03:30.630> in<00:03:30.780> a<00:03:30.900> hit<00:03:31.260> at<00:03:31.440> click<00:03:31.950> on<00:03:32.070> the<00:03:32.190> arrow<00:03:32.370> and

00:03:32.600 --> 00:03:32.610 
type in a hit at click on the arrow and

00:03:32.610 --> 00:03:35.090 
type in a hit at click on the arrow and
hit<00:03:32.730> SM<00:03:33.209> and<00:03:33.450> it<00:03:33.870> should<00:03:34.140> go<00:03:34.320> to<00:03:34.380> smooth<00:03:34.800> and

00:03:35.090 --> 00:03:35.100 
hit SM and it should go to smooth and

00:03:35.100 --> 00:03:38.120 
hit SM and it should go to smooth and
then<00:03:35.790> click<00:03:36.209> on<00:03:36.390> whatever<00:03:37.230> smoothing<00:03:37.890> group

00:03:38.120 --> 00:03:38.130 
then click on whatever smoothing group

00:03:38.130 --> 00:03:40.190 
then click on whatever smoothing group
you<00:03:38.280> want<00:03:38.400> to<00:03:38.519> classify<00:03:38.760> us<00:03:39.000> under<00:03:39.420> those<00:03:39.900> if

00:03:40.190 --> 00:03:40.200 
you want to classify us under those if

00:03:40.200 --> 00:03:42.440 
you want to classify us under those if
you<00:03:40.320> aren't<00:03:40.500> familiar<00:03:40.980> with<00:03:41.550> 3ds<00:03:41.940> max<00:03:42.209> and

00:03:42.440 --> 00:03:42.450 
you aren't familiar with 3ds max and

00:03:42.450 --> 00:03:45.140 
you aren't familiar with 3ds max and
then<00:03:42.540> click<00:03:42.750> on<00:03:42.870> one<00:03:43.200> and<00:03:43.459> that<00:03:44.459> has<00:03:44.760> smooth

00:03:45.140 --> 00:03:45.150 
then click on one and that has smooth

00:03:45.150 --> 00:03:47.960 
then click on one and that has smooth
your<00:03:45.660> mesh<00:03:45.870> so<00:03:46.830> if<00:03:47.100> we<00:03:47.250> were<00:03:47.430> to<00:03:47.489> render<00:03:47.850> this

00:03:47.960 --> 00:03:47.970 
your mesh so if we were to render this

00:03:47.970 --> 00:03:54.640 
your mesh so if we were to render this
out<00:03:48.180> by<00:03:48.570> hitting<00:03:48.840> shift<00:03:49.230> q<00:03:49.940> you<00:03:50.940> can<00:03:51.090> see<00:03:51.510> that

00:03:54.640 --> 00:03:54.650 

00:03:54.650 --> 00:04:02.690 

it's<00:03:55.650> pretty<00:03:56.010> pretty<00:03:56.790> good<00:04:01.100> the<00:04:02.100> go<00:04:02.640> to

00:04:02.690 --> 00:04:02.700 
it's pretty pretty good the go to

00:04:02.700 --> 00:04:04.400 
it's pretty pretty good the go to
further<00:04:03.420> frame<00:04:03.810> where<00:04:03.989> it<00:04:04.050> looks<00:04:04.230> a<00:04:04.320> little

00:04:04.400 --> 00:04:04.410 
further frame where it looks a little

00:04:04.410 --> 00:04:13.420 
further frame where it looks a little
better<00:04:07.550> yep<00:04:08.550> there's<00:04:08.940> our<00:04:09.150> fluid

00:04:13.420 --> 00:04:13.430 

00:04:13.430 --> 00:04:15.880 

now<00:04:14.030> let's<00:04:14.540> set<00:04:14.840> up<00:04:14.870> a<00:04:15.049> quick<00:04:15.290> scene<00:04:15.620> right

00:04:15.880 --> 00:04:15.890 
now let's set up a quick scene right

00:04:15.890 --> 00:04:35.560 
now let's set up a quick scene right
quick<00:04:18.699> scale<00:04:19.699> that<00:04:19.910> up<00:04:29.050> 2000<00:04:34.210> Center<00:04:35.210> it<00:04:35.360> and

00:04:35.560 --> 00:04:35.570 
quick scale that up 2000 Center it and

00:04:35.570 --> 00:04:37.840 
quick scale that up 2000 Center it and
then<00:04:35.930> we're<00:04:36.139> going<00:04:36.229> to<00:04:36.289> add<00:04:36.380> a<00:04:36.500> light<00:04:36.919> message

00:04:37.840 --> 00:04:37.850 
then we're going to add a light message

00:04:37.850 --> 00:04:39.310 
then we're going to add a light message
it<00:04:37.970> I'm<00:04:38.150> going<00:04:38.479> to<00:04:38.570> speed<00:04:38.810> through<00:04:39.169> this

00:04:39.310 --> 00:04:39.320 
it I'm going to speed through this

00:04:39.320 --> 00:04:40.770 
it I'm going to speed through this
because<00:04:39.560> it's<00:04:39.800> really<00:04:39.889> not<00:04:40.100> that<00:04:40.160> important

00:04:40.770 --> 00:04:40.780 
because it's really not that important

00:04:40.780 --> 00:04:44.710 
because it's really not that important
okay<00:04:41.780> and<00:04:42.050> now<00:04:42.500> i'm<00:04:43.009> going<00:04:43.520> to<00:04:43.759> go<00:04:43.940> up<00:04:44.090> to<00:04:44.360> the

00:04:44.710 --> 00:04:44.720 
okay and now i'm going to go up to the

00:04:44.720 --> 00:04:48.249 
okay and now i'm going to go up to the
material<00:04:45.350> editor<00:04:46.240> click<00:04:47.240> that<00:04:47.539> and<00:04:47.840> then<00:04:48.139> i'm

00:04:48.249 --> 00:04:48.259 
material editor click that and then i'm

00:04:48.259 --> 00:04:52.629 
material editor click that and then i'm
going<00:04:48.500> to<00:04:48.650> change<00:04:49.539> this<00:04:50.539> to<00:04:50.990> water<00:04:51.550> now<00:04:52.550> i'm

00:04:52.629 --> 00:04:52.639 
going to change this to water now i'm

00:04:52.639 --> 00:04:55.170 
going to change this to water now i'm
going<00:04:52.729> to<00:04:52.820> drag<00:04:53.030> the<00:04:53.240> water<00:04:53.560> over<00:04:54.560> there<00:04:54.830> and

00:04:55.170 --> 00:04:55.180 
going to drag the water over there and

00:04:55.180 --> 00:04:57.490 
going to drag the water over there and
render<00:04:56.180> that<00:04:56.300> out<00:04:56.360> and<00:04:56.690> see<00:04:56.900> how<00:04:56.930> it<00:04:57.110> turns<00:04:57.289> out

00:04:57.490 --> 00:04:57.500 
render that out and see how it turns out

00:04:57.500 --> 00:05:03.159 
render that out and see how it turns out
and<00:04:57.910> it<00:04:58.910> should<00:04:59.889> just<00:05:00.889> like<00:05:01.070> water<00:05:02.169> see

00:05:03.159 --> 00:05:03.169 
and it should just like water see

00:05:03.169 --> 00:05:07.510 
and it should just like water see
perfect<00:05:04.009> water<00:05:04.509> by<00:05:05.509> zooming<00:05:06.250> nope<00:05:07.250> wait

00:05:07.510 --> 00:05:07.520 
perfect water by zooming nope wait

00:05:07.520 --> 00:05:11.260 
perfect water by zooming nope wait
that's<00:05:07.729> Pixley<00:05:08.150> they're<00:05:08.449> mine<00:05:08.599> but<00:05:09.320> um<00:05:10.270> yeah

00:05:11.260 --> 00:05:11.270 
that's Pixley they're mine but um yeah

00:05:11.270 --> 00:05:13.510 
that's Pixley they're mine but um yeah
so<00:05:11.570> that<00:05:11.780> is<00:05:12.020> how<00:05:12.259> to<00:05:12.320> get<00:05:12.530> a<00:05:12.590> water<00:05:12.860> material

00:05:13.510 --> 00:05:13.520 
so that is how to get a water material

00:05:13.520 --> 00:05:19.420 
so that is how to get a water material
and<00:05:15.250> that<00:05:16.250> is<00:05:16.460> how<00:05:16.610> do<00:05:16.669> you<00:05:16.820> import<00:05:17.740> water<00:05:18.740> in<00:05:19.039> a

00:05:19.420 --> 00:05:19.430 
and that is how do you import water in a

00:05:19.430 --> 00:05:22.930 
and that is how do you import water in a
real<00:05:20.060> flow<00:05:20.389> into<00:05:20.840> 3ds<00:05:21.260> max<00:05:21.560> so<00:05:21.979> see<00:05:22.789> you<00:05:22.909> next

00:05:22.930 --> 00:05:22.940 
real flow into 3ds max so see you next

00:05:22.940 --> 00:05:25.539 
real flow into 3ds max so see you next
week
