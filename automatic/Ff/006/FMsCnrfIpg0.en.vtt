00:02:37.190 --> 00:02:37.200 
go right around for all eight directions

00:02:37.200 --> 00:02:39.150 
go right around for all eight directions
first<00:02:38.200> thing<00:02:38.380> you<00:02:38.470> notice<00:02:38.709> when<00:02:38.770> you<00:02:38.860> walk<00:02:38.920> in

00:02:39.150 --> 00:02:39.160 
first thing you notice when you walk in

00:02:39.160 --> 00:02:40.260 
first thing you notice when you walk in
here<00:02:39.190> is<00:02:39.430> there's<00:02:39.550> like<00:02:39.610> a<00:02:39.670> thousand<00:02:40.180> red

00:02:40.260 --> 00:02:40.270 
here is there's like a thousand red

00:02:40.270 --> 00:02:41.880 
here is there's like a thousand red
lights<00:02:40.480> and<00:02:40.690> what's<00:02:40.840> that<00:02:40.989> about<00:02:41.200> so

00:02:41.880 --> 00:02:41.890 
lights and what's that about so

00:02:41.890 --> 00:02:45.270 
lights and what's that about so
basically<00:02:42.370> each<00:02:42.610> camera<00:02:43.090> will<00:02:43.890> shine<00:02:44.890> towards

00:02:45.270 --> 00:02:45.280 
basically each camera will shine towards

00:02:45.280 --> 00:02:47.220 
basically each camera will shine towards
the<00:02:45.400> markers<00:02:45.760> bounce<00:02:46.180> off<00:02:46.450> of<00:02:46.630> the<00:02:46.750> reflective

00:02:47.220 --> 00:02:47.230 
the markers bounce off of the reflective

00:02:47.230 --> 00:02:49.260 
the markers bounce off of the reflective
tape<00:02:47.410> and<00:02:47.590> go<00:02:47.650> back<00:02:47.830> into<00:02:48.040> the<00:02:48.220> camera<00:02:48.430> so<00:02:49.180> the

00:02:49.260 --> 00:02:49.270 
tape and go back into the camera so the

00:02:49.270 --> 00:02:51.780 
tape and go back into the camera so the
cameras<00:02:49.600> can<00:02:49.660> only<00:02:49.959> see<00:02:50.320> a<00:02:50.350> red<00:02:50.620> light<00:02:50.800> when

00:02:51.780 --> 00:02:51.790 
cameras can only see a red light when

00:02:51.790 --> 00:02:54.090 
cameras can only see a red light when
all<00:02:51.970> the<00:02:52.120> cameras<00:02:52.480> talk<00:02:52.720> to<00:02:52.870> each<00:02:52.989> other<00:02:53.200> they

00:02:54.090 --> 00:02:54.100 
all the cameras talk to each other they

00:02:54.100 --> 00:02:55.680 
all the cameras talk to each other they
turn<00:02:54.310> it<00:02:54.430> into<00:02:54.489> three-dimensional<00:02:54.970> data<00:02:55.390> and

00:02:55.680 --> 00:02:55.690 
turn it into three-dimensional data and

00:02:55.690 --> 00:02:57.600 
turn it into three-dimensional data and
you<00:02:55.780> see<00:02:55.810> what<00:02:56.680> you<00:02:56.770> see<00:02:56.950> on<00:02:57.070> screen<00:02:57.190> there<00:02:57.489> you

00:02:57.600 --> 00:02:57.610 
you see what you see on screen there you

00:02:57.610 --> 00:02:59.910 
you see what you see on screen there you
see<00:02:58.080> basically<00:02:59.080> a<00:02:59.110> three-dimensional

00:02:59.910 --> 00:02:59.920 
see basically a three-dimensional

00:02:59.920 --> 00:03:03.360 
see basically a three-dimensional
representation<00:03:00.370> of<00:03:01.000> our<00:03:01.510> talent<00:03:01.930> and<00:03:02.370> Elden

00:03:03.360 --> 00:03:03.370 
representation of our talent and Elden

00:03:03.370 --> 00:03:05.520 
representation of our talent and Elden
here<00:03:03.610> we'll<00:03:03.880> look<00:03:04.720> at<00:03:04.870> the<00:03:04.959> data<00:03:05.140> after<00:03:05.260> it's

00:03:05.520 --> 00:03:05.530 
here we'll look at the data after it's

00:03:05.530 --> 00:03:07.140 
here we'll look at the data after it's
been<00:03:05.650> captured<00:03:06.070> and<00:03:06.250> he<00:03:06.489> can<00:03:06.670> clean<00:03:06.910> it<00:03:07.030> up

00:03:07.140 --> 00:03:07.150 
been captured and he can clean it up

00:03:07.150 --> 00:03:09.300 
been captured and he can clean it up
when<00:03:08.020> he's<00:03:08.200> done<00:03:08.380> he'll<00:03:08.620> send<00:03:08.860> the<00:03:08.950> data<00:03:09.100> off

00:03:09.300 --> 00:03:09.310 
when he's done he'll send the data off

00:03:09.310 --> 00:03:11.580 
when he's done he'll send the data off
to<00:03:09.700> the<00:03:10.270> game<00:03:10.450> team<00:03:10.720> and<00:03:11.050> they'll<00:03:11.230> put<00:03:11.410> it<00:03:11.500> on

00:03:11.580 --> 00:03:11.590 
to the game team and they'll put it on

00:03:11.590 --> 00:03:17.490 
to the game team and they'll put it on
the<00:03:11.680> model<00:03:11.950> and
