 computer is the mx 4t in blues is the 

00:00:24.840 --> 00:00:29.400
 This machine's cabinet is a max raid goes 

00:00:28.710 --> 00:00:31.439

00:00:29.400 --> 00:00:34.790
 Let's expose in him he has shows 

00:00:31.439 --> 00:00:37.920
 arranged in the front that gives style all 

00:00:34.790 --> 00:00:40.260
 differentiated on the internet is in the 

00:00:37.920 --> 00:00:41.969
 from the front we also have a lid 

00:00:40.260 --> 00:00:45.989
 which selects the power and 

00:00:41.969 --> 00:00:48.570
 off and I did the front USB and one was 

00:00:45.989 --> 00:00:50.989
 hand over the microphone phone singing 

00:00:48.570 --> 00:00:53.789
 protects you if you want to install 

00:00:50.989 --> 00:00:56.370
 then a dvd burner this brand does not 

00:00:53.789 --> 00:00:59.550
 well you put in the cart more left over 

00:00:56.370 --> 00:01:01.789
 Are you an online gaming machine? 

00:00:59.550 --> 00:01:07.140
 and put it in the player's 

00:01:01.789 --> 00:01:11.850
 while the dust of Capoeira Aquino 

00:01:07.140 --> 00:01:16.080
 recorder nor is it well ventilated has 

00:01:11.850 --> 00:01:17.820
 the drilling on top that if you find 

00:01:16.080 --> 00:01:19.920
 this Saturday but he already comes with a team 

00:01:17.820 --> 00:01:24.180
 I'll show you who have this 

00:01:19.920 --> 00:01:27.360
 so coordinated and clinical can give 

00:01:24.180 --> 00:01:29.070
 to see the machine inside one more 

00:01:27.360 --> 00:01:30.150
 you want to add only the 

00:01:29.070 --> 00:01:34.159
 goalkeeper carrizo 

00:01:30.150 --> 00:01:39.210
 The other one I do not know is taking away the 

00:01:34.159 --> 00:01:45.990
 setting the processor configuration 

00:01:39.210 --> 00:01:49.140
 amd fx 4.300 is 3.8 already runs 

00:01:45.990 --> 00:01:55.229
 Are we having this machine 8 gb of 

00:01:49.140 --> 00:01:59.100
 ddr3 1333 brand memory to ride 

00:01:55.229 --> 00:02:02.100
 It 's pretty basic now but it's 8 gb of 

00:01:59.100 --> 00:02:05.310
 memory what are you going to do? 

00:02:02.100 --> 00:02:08.970
 the benefit it already comes from 

00:02:05.310 --> 00:02:09.929
 of such splits - just pull the warm air 

00:02:08.970 --> 00:02:12.690
 get out 

00:02:09.929 --> 00:02:19.110
 okay and video card with this set is 

00:02:12.690 --> 00:02:24.510
 an M r 9270 RT and the plate is a touch 

00:02:19.110 --> 00:02:26.750
 of 2010 5 256 bits is the first of the 220 

00:02:24.510 --> 00:02:29.640
 that we have a price level is 

00:02:26.750 --> 00:02:31.890
 further down we also have the 

00:02:29.640 --> 00:02:32.760
 source of this set which is a 500 more 

00:02:31.890 --> 00:02:36.420
 OK 

00:02:32.760 --> 00:02:37.769
 we work with sources of the power of 

00:02:36.420 --> 00:02:41.160
 pasta and butter 

00:02:37.769 --> 00:02:43.620
 I and the machine storage is a 

00:02:41.160 --> 00:02:45.690
 area of 1,500 of the following I just 

00:02:43.620 --> 00:02:47.550
 forgetting motherboard 

00:02:45.690 --> 00:02:49.739
 how can you see there in this machine 

00:02:47.550 --> 00:02:52.560
 is with blues but usually this 

00:02:49.739 --> 00:02:53.790
 configuration goes like gigabyte is 

00:02:52.560 --> 00:02:59.760
 two at the same level 

00:02:53.790 --> 00:03:05.220
 OSCIP 7760 m d is an ideology that 

00:02:59.760 --> 00:03:10.590
 here the wing in 578 is an old base and the 

00:03:05.220 --> 00:03:12.390
 78 mts2, as you can see the 

00:03:10.590 --> 00:03:15.660
 cabinet is quite silent machine 

00:03:12.390 --> 00:03:20.640
 It works a long time here it does not have 

00:03:15.660 --> 00:03:22.739
 space for everything and not on one will not have 

00:03:20.640 --> 00:03:24.989
 problem with the heating is if you 

00:03:22.739 --> 00:03:27.750
 anyway you want to put you can 

00:03:24.989 --> 00:03:29.940
 put over a cooler or 2 tablespoons here 

00:03:27.750 --> 00:03:31.859
 in upper haiti and one more in cap 

00:03:29.940 --> 00:03:35.000
 side I was already spoken only 

00:03:31.859 --> 00:03:37.049
 called the truck was for you 

00:03:35.000 --> 00:03:38.670
 who wants to know the price of this 

00:03:37.049 --> 00:03:41.760
 machine click below the video that has 

00:03:38.670 --> 00:03:44.190
 the book on our site is that you will 

00:03:41.760 --> 00:03:45.510
 see the price of the monkey is now the people 

00:03:44.190 --> 00:03:50.970
 It's going to be a shame about the video. Let's go. 

00:03:45.510 --> 00:03:53.459
 come back with the test with br 412 we came back 

00:03:50.970 --> 00:03:55.170
 here with the test with the bf four bowls 

00:03:53.459 --> 00:03:59.190
 fifth round here in the machine 

00:03:55.170 --> 00:04:00.720
 have you seen and presented the bs-4 

00:03:59.190 --> 00:04:03.540
 side léo who is here playing 

00:04:00.720 --> 00:04:07.049
 23 inch leakage monitor 

00:04:03.540 --> 00:04:09.919
 He just got killed here. 

00:04:07.049 --> 00:04:13.240
 show the video making 

00:04:09.919 --> 00:04:16.180
 We already left the automatic 

00:04:13.240 --> 00:04:20.800
 and the computer the game makes everything up 

00:04:16.180 --> 00:04:23.140
 and I turn off the verse before the 

00:04:20.800 --> 00:04:26.950
 solution is on the run and the dress is 

00:04:23.140 --> 00:04:29.170
 connected in field of vision and 120 and people 

00:04:26.950 --> 00:04:33.390
 waiting button was 4 button is 

00:04:29.170 --> 00:04:37.660
 son of 41 a great graphic quality 

00:04:33.390 --> 00:04:40.420
 without getting washed and went to 

00:04:37.660 --> 00:04:42.640
 ask but each one is the fsf the people 

00:04:40.420 --> 00:04:45.460
 is not showing this video to 

00:04:42.640 --> 00:04:48.580
 prove you with a cost machine 

00:04:45.460 --> 00:04:51.940
 very accessible can play br4 a 

00:04:48.580 --> 00:04:56.890
 optimum continuous high graphic quality and 

00:04:51.940 --> 00:04:59.260
 you were doing well and performance is the 

00:04:56.890 --> 00:05:04.630
 important is the result we were 

00:04:59.260 --> 00:05:06.850
 having a lot of discussion is because ps does not 

00:05:04.630 --> 00:05:09.250
 It is the same as the other map our team 

00:05:06.850 --> 00:05:10.990
 kills is different for the so balloon to 

00:05:09.250 --> 00:05:13.030
 stop this discussion 

00:05:10.990 --> 00:05:14.850
 we are showing results to 

00:05:13.030 --> 00:05:19.540
 The machine that you can play 

00:05:14.850 --> 00:05:22.660
 legal without difficulties however in the high and 

00:05:19.540 --> 00:05:26.430
 You'll be able to have some fun in picking up 

00:05:22.660 --> 00:05:26.430
 for hours on end without worrying 

00:05:27.370 --> 00:05:33.220
 how can you see the details come out of the 

00:05:29.320 --> 00:05:36.090
 ground and the weapon very well 

00:05:33.220 --> 00:05:37.480
 designed very good in macapá and 

00:05:36.090 --> 00:05:39.670
 detailed 

00:05:37.480 --> 00:05:42.070
 there're the high difference of one or 

00:05:39.670 --> 00:05:46.570
 another is where free leaves things 

00:05:42.070 --> 00:05:50.200
 more round is we with the 

00:05:46.570 --> 00:05:53.100
 on the fsb goes from 8 and 30 and 50 to 

00:05:50.200 --> 00:05:55.530
 time of the map and the place where you 

00:05:53.100 --> 00:05:59.590
 Where are you? 

00:05:55.530 --> 00:06:04.020
 but this did not affect the gameplay and 

00:05:59.590 --> 00:06:04.020
 fun with the game 

00:06:06.720 --> 00:06:16.810
