 to bring in dotcom network we present a 

00:00:07.890 --> 00:00:13.139
 jacket water repellent of the house 

00:00:09.990 --> 00:00:14.940
 mizuno from mizuno internal elite jacket 

00:00:13.139 --> 00:00:16.470
 that has this jacket good first thing 

00:00:14.940 --> 00:00:19.590
 everything as you see a jacket 

00:00:16.470 --> 00:00:21.720
 Relieved that does not cut us movements 

00:00:19.590 --> 00:00:25.590
 sleeves more or less wide width in the 

00:00:21.720 --> 00:00:31.260
 armpit but limits us relaxed fix 

00:00:25.590 --> 00:00:33.780
 here full sleeve and rubber with the name 

00:00:31.260 --> 00:00:35.309
 of the house here to adjust the new 

00:00:33.780 --> 00:00:38.070
 technology to the new 

00:00:35.309 --> 00:00:40.530
 the new logos of the collection of 

00:00:38.070 --> 00:00:43.410
 I agree with you, here you have them in 

00:00:40.530 --> 00:00:46.020
 yellow very visible and taking advantage of that 

00:00:43.410 --> 00:00:48.030
 we have the zoom set here part 

00:00:46.020 --> 00:00:50.760
 central and incorporates a few 

00:00:48.030 --> 00:00:52.710
 squares that what they do is that if 

00:00:50.760 --> 00:00:54.960
 our jacket is hooked while 

00:00:52.710 --> 00:00:57.030
 let's go running in branches going to 

00:00:54.960 --> 00:00:58.800
 prevent scratching throughout the whole 

00:00:57.030 --> 00:01:01.079
 jacket but it's just going to break a 

00:00:58.800 --> 00:01:03.149
 square or two squares after 

00:01:01.079 --> 00:01:04.799
 Armpit taking account of a jacket 

00:01:03.149 --> 00:01:06.719
 that repels the water we need a lot 

00:01:04.799 --> 00:01:08.249
 more perspiration so my turn here 

00:01:06.719 --> 00:01:10.170
 in the part of the armpit incorporated to 

00:01:08.249 --> 00:01:13.619
 a few small holes we're going to 

00:01:10.170 --> 00:01:15.420
 the holes here to favor this 

00:01:13.619 --> 00:01:17.310
 expulsion of sweat and continue to maintain 

00:01:15.420 --> 00:01:19.229
 water repellency because here no 

00:01:17.310 --> 00:01:22.470
 we 're going to cost us more than that 

00:01:19.229 --> 00:01:25.850
 wet central part full zipper 

00:01:22.470 --> 00:01:28.320
 generous car easy to catch with 

00:01:25.850 --> 00:01:29.580
 rubber support and it is fixed with 

00:01:28.320 --> 00:01:31.560
 that we're going to prevent you from being heard 

00:01:29.580 --> 00:01:33.450
 clec all the time this yellow part 

00:01:31.560 --> 00:01:35.880
 central that you see all this part 

00:01:33.450 --> 00:01:37.500
 central is reflective and they make us more 

00:01:35.880 --> 00:01:39.750
 visible if we run through urban areas 

00:01:37.500 --> 00:01:41.909
 like pocket this pocket 

00:01:39.750 --> 00:01:43.590
 here side only incorporates one in the 

00:01:41.909 --> 00:01:45.600
 another side we do not have also incorporates 

00:01:43.590 --> 00:01:47.310
 a zipper with a smaller car 

00:01:45.600 --> 00:01:49.649
 but that remains subject and the two lines 

00:01:47.310 --> 00:01:50.729
 reflective yellow if we open the 

00:01:49.649 --> 00:01:52.950
 pocket on the inside 

00:01:50.729 --> 00:01:54.869
 we will find a second pocket in the 

00:01:52.950 --> 00:01:57.390
 that we can put either keys or a 

00:01:54.869 --> 00:01:59.429
 mp3 in any case if we carry an mp3 

00:01:57.390 --> 00:02:01.020
 We will have to take it covered 

00:01:59.429 --> 00:02:03.000
 since our own sweat could 

00:02:01.020 --> 00:02:06.750
 arrive 

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:09.570
 to wet it is worth a pocket and then in the 

00:02:06.750 --> 00:02:11.880
 final part we find here a hole 

00:02:09.570 --> 00:02:13.860
 that what allows to remove the helmets by 

00:02:11.880 --> 00:02:14.720
 here and at the top here up 

00:02:13.860 --> 00:02:17.310
 fixed 

00:02:14.720 --> 00:02:19.590
 we have a pocket there is another hole 

00:02:17.310 --> 00:02:21.690
 to get what we earn with this 

00:02:19.590 --> 00:02:23.160
 we carry the cable on the inside 

00:02:21.690 --> 00:02:24.900
 and if we run through areas with a lot 

00:02:23.160 --> 00:02:27.120
 vegetation will not get us hooked 

00:02:24.900 --> 00:02:28.890
 that will stay in the inner part and 

00:02:27.120 --> 00:02:31.170
 this prevents snagging and we 

00:02:28.890 --> 00:02:32.880
 remove the lower part helmets as 

00:02:31.170 --> 00:02:34.950
 hold the windbreaker well two two 

00:02:32.880 --> 00:02:36.840
 carabiner is one on each side tape 

00:02:34.950 --> 00:02:39.620
 yellow an elastic cord that we 

00:02:36.840 --> 00:02:42.890
 helps hold the 

00:02:39.620 --> 00:02:44.870
 the jacket agreed here and close and 

00:02:42.890 --> 00:02:47.810
 avoid getting in the air by the 

00:02:44.870 --> 00:02:49.700
 bottom part top top 

00:02:47.810 --> 00:02:51.980
 we have the car we can pick it up 

00:02:49.700 --> 00:02:54.920
 pretty high neck rogues that we 

00:02:51.980 --> 00:02:57.319
 just take the nut and we have the 

00:02:54.920 --> 00:02:59.720
 covers in the flap that covers us 

00:02:57.319 --> 00:03:01.959
 avoid chafing in this whole area here 

00:02:59.720 --> 00:03:05.329
 the name of technology technology 

00:03:01.959 --> 00:03:07.010
 of the house one that we'll talk about we should 

00:03:05.329 --> 00:03:08.569
 we teach what it is that makes 

00:03:07.010 --> 00:03:13.180
 technology is here we have a bottle 

00:03:08.569 --> 00:03:13.180
 of water here in the sleeve to fix 

00:03:14.500 --> 00:03:20.500
 how the water runs over the 

00:03:18.380 --> 00:03:23.300
 jacket and does not get wet 

00:03:20.500 --> 00:03:25.280
 although the machines fijaros drops 

00:03:23.300 --> 00:03:26.959
 agreement 

00:03:25.280 --> 00:03:28.280
 This guarantees us 

00:03:26.959 --> 00:03:31.040
 guarantees that if a rain is falling 

00:03:28.280 --> 00:03:32.450
 fine or while we are running he takes us 

00:03:31.040 --> 00:03:34.280
 something rain will cover us 

00:03:32.450 --> 00:03:36.410
 we will be able to spend long days 

00:03:34.280 --> 00:03:37.850
 running with this doing ultras with this 

00:03:36.410 --> 00:03:40.459
 since it is not waterproof it is only 

00:03:37.850 --> 00:03:42.380
 water repellent but notice that it has 

00:03:40.459 --> 00:03:44.330
 worked quite well part of the 

00:03:42.380 --> 00:03:46.040
 good back here on top 

00:03:44.330 --> 00:03:48.440
 we have all this tape also the 

00:03:46.040 --> 00:03:49.970
 reflective if we run by areas let's 

00:03:48.440 --> 00:03:51.319
 to be visible by urban areas and here 

00:03:49.970 --> 00:03:53.390
 in the back on the other side 

00:03:51.319 --> 00:03:55.580
 it is also incorporated by this whole 

00:03:53.390 --> 00:03:57.500
 here in reflective the neck as os 

00:03:55.580 --> 00:03:59.780
 we said high and in the bottom 

00:03:57.500 --> 00:04:01.550
 we have this generous large pocket in 

00:03:59.780 --> 00:04:04.489
 which fits our hand without any 

00:04:01.550 --> 00:04:07.340
 problem and that is that once we want 

00:04:04.489 --> 00:04:09.050
 fold this jacket we teach the part 

00:04:07.340 --> 00:04:10.920
 internal what we said about the hole for 

00:04:09.050 --> 00:04:13.500
 take out the mp3 

00:04:10.920 --> 00:04:15.750
 end up going on the headset cord 

00:04:13.500 --> 00:04:18.209
 up here 

00:04:15.750 --> 00:04:20.130
 and how can we fold this jacket and 

00:04:18.209 --> 00:04:21.600
 take it eggs these jackets many 

00:04:20.130 --> 00:04:23.760
 Sometimes we go running with them, he 

00:04:21.600 --> 00:04:26.310
 it's not clear we do not know if it's going to rain 

00:04:23.760 --> 00:04:27.630
 or not good because we take and auto fold 

00:04:26.310 --> 00:04:31.320
 inside the pocket itself we go 

00:04:27.630 --> 00:04:33.050
 picking up the jacket to fix a 

00:04:31.320 --> 00:04:36.099
 Easy way 

00:04:33.050 --> 00:04:36.099
 we see rotate 

00:04:36.630 --> 00:04:40.320
 and with the zipper of your pocket 

00:04:38.460 --> 00:04:42.270
 but on the outside we have 

00:04:40.320 --> 00:04:44.190
 collection 

00:04:42.270 --> 00:04:46.470
 the entire jacket also incorporates a 

00:04:44.190 --> 00:04:48.180
 Elastic band so we can hang up the 

00:04:46.470 --> 00:04:49.590
 We carry in a belt we do not take it 

00:04:48.180 --> 00:04:51.630
 hanging in the backpack we got wet 

00:04:49.590 --> 00:04:53.460
 and we want it to dry up after 

00:04:51.630 --> 00:04:55.680
 the mizuno house also in reflective 

00:04:53.460 --> 00:04:57.570
 to be visible this is the 

00:04:55.680 --> 00:04:59.340
 proposal of the mizuno house to run 

00:04:57.570 --> 00:05:01.380
 this spring this summer racing 

00:04:59.340 --> 00:05:03.000
 mountain that we observe that can catch 

00:05:01.380 --> 00:05:04.350
 more some rain but it will not be all 

00:05:03.000 --> 00:05:06.780
 the good day well here we have a 

00:05:04.350 --> 00:05:09.780
 very light windbreaker repellent to the 

00:05:06.780 --> 00:05:11.430
 water the mizuno waterproof jacket and 

00:05:09.780 --> 00:05:14.690
 up to here an analysis over three range 

00:05:11.430 --> 00:05:14.690
 point with see you in the next
