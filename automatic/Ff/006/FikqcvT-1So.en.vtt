00:00:19.580 --> 00:00:19.590 
camping in as yet it's a cadence - it's

00:00:19.590 --> 00:00:22.640 
camping in as yet it's a cadence - it's
fully<00:00:19.859> guide<00:00:20.189> out<00:00:20.430> which<00:00:21.330> is<00:00:21.480> unnecessary<00:00:22.199> but

for<00:00:23.070> the<00:00:23.130> review<00:00:23.400> I<00:00:23.430> thought<00:00:23.670> I'd<00:00:23.789> got<00:00:23.970> out<00:00:24.210> I

00:00:25.420 --> 00:00:25.430 
for the review I thought I'd got out I

00:00:25.430 --> 00:00:30.439 
for the review I thought I'd got out I
will<00:00:26.430> use<00:00:27.080> this<00:00:28.080> on<00:00:28.320> a<00:00:28.349> regular<00:00:28.439> basis<00:00:29.390> as<00:00:30.390> a

00:00:30.439 --> 00:00:30.449 
will use this on a regular basis as a

00:00:30.449 --> 00:00:32.120 
will use this on a regular basis as a
pulse<00:00:30.810> of<00:00:30.960> all<00:00:31.140> the<00:00:31.320> way<00:00:31.439> from<00:00:31.740> the<00:00:31.859> screen

00:00:32.120 --> 00:00:32.130 
pulse of all the way from the screen

00:00:32.130 --> 00:00:34.880 
pulse of all the way from the screen
inside<00:00:33.020> there<00:00:34.020> is<00:00:34.110> a<00:00:34.140> window<00:00:34.500> on<00:00:34.530> the<00:00:34.739> back

00:00:34.880 --> 00:00:34.890 
inside there is a window on the back

00:00:34.890 --> 00:00:38.569 
inside there is a window on the back
side<00:00:35.160> that<00:00:35.219> opens<00:00:35.430> up<00:00:35.910> in<00:00:36.270> the<00:00:36.870> fly<00:00:37.079> and<00:00:37.579> the

00:00:38.569 --> 00:00:38.579 
side that opens up in the fly and the

00:00:38.579 --> 00:00:42.910 
side that opens up in the fly and the
screen<00:00:38.879> inside<00:00:39.770> unzips<00:00:41.149> kind<00:00:42.149> of<00:00:42.270> a<00:00:42.300> half<00:00:42.510> door

00:00:42.910 --> 00:00:42.920 
screen inside unzips kind of a half door

00:00:42.920 --> 00:00:45.020 
screen inside unzips kind of a half door
I'm<00:00:43.920> not<00:00:43.950> sure<00:00:44.219> what<00:00:44.430> the<00:00:44.520> purpose<00:00:44.670> for<00:00:45.000> that

00:00:45.020 --> 00:00:45.030 
I'm not sure what the purpose for that

00:00:45.030 --> 00:00:47.569

of<00:00:45.329> that<00:00:45.510> is<00:00:45.690> but<00:00:46.020> it<00:00:46.530> does<00:00:46.710> unzip<00:00:47.129> if<00:00:47.280> you<00:00:47.399> have

00:00:47.569 --> 00:00:47.579 
of that is but it does unzip if you have

00:00:47.579 --> 00:00:53.010
