focused<00:00:13.350> on<00:00:13.530> making<00:00:14.219> sprites<00:00:14.730> and<00:00:15.530> objects

00:00:16.520 --> 00:00:16.530 
focused on making sprites and objects

00:00:16.530 --> 00:00:20.150 
focused on making sprites and objects
for<00:00:16.710> the<00:00:16.800> game<00:00:18.020> now<00:00:19.020> we<00:00:19.080> will<00:00:19.440> focus<00:00:19.650> it<00:00:19.949> on

00:00:20.150 --> 00:00:20.160 
for the game now we will focus it on

00:00:20.160 --> 00:00:23.840 
for the game now we will focus it on
making<00:00:21.030> a<00:00:21.360> live<00:00:21.990> system<00:00:22.320> and<00:00:22.680> a<00:00:23.130> score<00:00:23.430> system

00:00:23.840 --> 00:00:23.850 
making a live system and a score system

00:00:23.850 --> 00:00:28.700 
making a live system and a score system
for<00:00:24.210> the<00:00:24.300> game<00:00:26.030> the<00:00:27.030> first<00:00:27.300> thing<00:00:27.570> is<00:00:27.810> to<00:00:28.470> make

00:00:28.700 --> 00:00:28.710 
for the game the first thing is to make

00:00:28.710 --> 00:00:32.179 
for the game the first thing is to make
an<00:00:28.890> object<00:00:29.280> called<00:00:29.760> game<00:00:30.420> start<00:00:30.810> and<00:00:31.080> end<00:00:31.320> so

00:00:32.179 --> 00:00:32.189 
an object called game start and end so

00:00:32.189 --> 00:00:36.610 
an object called game start and end so
we'll<00:00:32.399> create<00:00:32.790> an<00:00:33.000> object<00:00:33.420> and<00:00:33.690> name<00:00:34.680> it<00:00:34.890> game

00:00:36.610 --> 00:00:36.620 
we'll create an object and name it game

00:00:36.620 --> 00:00:41.420 
we'll create an object and name it game
underscore<00:00:37.620> start<00:00:38.329> and<00:00:39.329> end<00:00:40.290> this<00:00:41.010> is<00:00:41.250> an

00:00:41.420 --> 00:00:41.430 
underscore start and end this is an

00:00:41.430 --> 00:00:43.430 
underscore start and end this is an
object<00:00:42.000> that<00:00:42.060> will<00:00:42.360> not<00:00:42.600> have<00:00:42.840> any<00:00:43.140> sprite

00:00:43.430 --> 00:00:43.440 
object that will not have any sprite

00:00:43.440 --> 00:00:45.979 
object that will not have any sprite
attached<00:00:43.800> to<00:00:44.040> it<00:00:44.130> it<00:00:44.700> will<00:00:44.910> be<00:00:45.060> an<00:00:45.300> invisible

00:00:45.979 --> 00:00:45.989 
attached to it it will be an invisible

00:00:45.989 --> 00:00:48.470 
attached to it it will be an invisible
object<00:00:46.200> within<00:00:46.680> the<00:00:46.860> game<00:00:47.040> but<00:00:47.640> it<00:00:47.760> will<00:00:47.940> have

00:00:48.470 --> 00:00:48.480 
object within the game but it will have

00:00:48.480 --> 00:00:52.040 
object within the game but it will have
an<00:00:48.690> function<00:00:49.680> because<00:00:50.040> it<00:00:50.340> will<00:00:50.520> always<00:00:51.420> check

00:00:52.040 --> 00:00:52.050 
an function because it will always check

00:00:52.050 --> 00:00:54.770 
an function because it will always check
whenever<00:00:52.620> the<00:00:52.980> score<00:00:53.460> goes<00:00:53.700> up<00:00:53.910> and<00:00:54.210> whenever

00:00:54.770 --> 00:00:54.780 
whenever the score goes up and whenever

00:00:54.780 --> 00:00:58.010 
whenever the score goes up and whenever
there's<00:00:55.500> a<00:00:55.560> risk<00:00:55.829> of<00:00:56.070> the<00:00:56.309> player<00:00:56.790> dying<00:00:57.149> so<00:00:57.750> we

00:00:58.010 --> 00:00:58.020 
there's a risk of the player dying so we

00:00:58.020 --> 00:01:01.069 
there's a risk of the player dying so we
will<00:00:58.500> need<00:00:58.710> to<00:00:59.130> add<00:00:59.370> an<00:00:59.550> event<00:00:59.670> and<00:01:00.630> select

00:01:01.069 --> 00:01:01.079 
will need to add an event and select

00:01:01.079 --> 00:01:04.579 
will need to add an event and select
other<00:01:01.530> and<00:01:01.980> then<00:01:02.730> on<00:01:02.910> room<00:01:03.270> start<00:01:03.660> something

00:01:04.579 --> 00:01:04.589 
other and then on room start something

00:01:04.589 --> 00:01:09.020 
other and then on room start something
should<00:01:04.799> happen<00:01:04.979> on<00:01:06.259> room<00:01:07.259> start<00:01:07.590> we<00:01:08.219> will<00:01:08.460> sit

00:01:09.020 --> 00:01:09.030 
should happen on room start we will sit

00:01:09.030 --> 00:01:11.960 
should happen on room start we will sit
the<00:01:09.600> lives<00:01:09.840> and<00:01:10.110> the<00:01:10.409> score<00:01:10.710> at<00:01:11.190> the<00:01:11.430> start

00:01:11.960 --> 00:01:11.970 
the lives and the score at the start

00:01:11.970 --> 00:01:17.060 
the lives and the score at the start
values<00:01:12.650> so<00:01:13.650> use<00:01:13.979> this<00:01:14.450> set<00:01:15.450> lives<00:01:16.070> into

00:01:17.060 --> 00:01:17.070 
values so use this set lives into

00:01:17.070 --> 00:01:23.620 
values so use this set lives into
actions<00:01:17.520> and<00:01:17.729> set<00:01:18.420> lives<00:01:18.840> to<00:01:19.200> 3<00:01:21.229> click<00:01:22.229> OK<00:01:22.740> and

00:01:23.620 --> 00:01:23.630 
actions and set lives to 3 click OK and

00:01:23.630 --> 00:01:27.350 
actions and set lives to 3 click OK and
then<00:01:24.630> take<00:01:24.930> this<00:01:25.170> score<00:01:25.500> and<00:01:25.820> use<00:01:26.820> this<00:01:27.060> also

00:01:27.350 --> 00:01:27.360 
then take this score and use this also

00:01:27.360 --> 00:01:30.550 
then take this score and use this also
sets<00:01:28.229> goal<00:01:28.500> and<00:01:28.710> we'll<00:01:29.190> set<00:01:29.460> this<00:01:29.670> to<00:01:29.909> zero

00:01:30.550 --> 00:01:30.560 
sets goal and we'll set this to zero

00:01:30.560 --> 00:01:35.469 
sets goal and we'll set this to zero
click<00:01:31.560> OK<00:01:33.170> then<00:01:34.170> we<00:01:34.500> will<00:01:34.619> add<00:01:34.799> an<00:01:35.070> event

00:01:35.469 --> 00:01:35.479 
click OK then we will add an event

00:01:35.479 --> 00:01:39.230 
click OK then we will add an event
called<00:01:36.479> step<00:01:36.840> step<00:01:37.830> happens<00:01:38.220> every<00:01:38.820> time<00:01:39.000> the

00:01:39.230 --> 00:01:39.240 
called step step happens every time the

00:01:39.240 --> 00:01:41.690 
called step step happens every time the
game<00:01:39.450> is<00:01:39.479> updated<00:01:40.200> and<00:01:40.350> that<00:01:40.380> happens<00:01:40.950> many

00:01:41.690 --> 00:01:41.700 
game is updated and that happens many

00:01:41.700 --> 00:01:45.140 
game is updated and that happens many
times<00:01:41.850> every<00:01:42.299> second<00:01:42.900> so<00:01:43.680> click<00:01:43.950> step<00:01:44.189> and<00:01:44.430> add

00:01:45.140 --> 00:01:45.150 
times every second so click step and add

00:01:45.150 --> 00:01:51.560 
times every second so click step and add
this<00:01:45.950> test<00:01:46.950> lives<00:01:49.310> this<00:01:50.310> is<00:01:50.369> an<00:01:50.759> action<00:01:51.090> that

00:01:51.560 --> 00:01:51.570 
this test lives this is an action that

00:01:51.570 --> 00:01:55.190 
this test lives this is an action that
will<00:01:51.720> test<00:01:52.049> if<00:01:53.000> lives<00:01:54.000> are<00:01:54.299> equal<00:01:54.750> to<00:01:54.960> a<00:01:54.990> value

00:01:55.190 --> 00:01:55.200 
will test if lives are equal to a value

00:01:55.200 --> 00:01:58.219 
will test if lives are equal to a value
and<00:01:55.619> we<00:01:55.830> will<00:01:56.009> set<00:01:56.670> 0<00:01:57.060> that<00:01:57.509> is<00:01:57.630> the<00:01:57.810> standard

00:01:58.219 --> 00:01:58.229 
and we will set 0 that is the standard

00:01:58.229 --> 00:02:03.080 
and we will set 0 that is the standard
value<00:01:58.710> and<00:02:00.110> ask<00:02:01.110> if<00:02:01.590> that<00:02:01.890> happens<00:02:02.610> what

00:02:03.080 --> 00:02:03.090 
value and ask if that happens what

00:02:03.090 --> 00:02:05.359 
value and ask if that happens what
should<00:02:03.270> happen<00:02:03.450> next<00:02:03.720> and<00:02:04.049> the<00:02:04.920> next<00:02:04.950> thing

00:02:05.359 --> 00:02:05.369 
should happen next and the next thing

00:02:05.369 --> 00:02:07.550 
should happen next and the next thing
that<00:02:05.729> should<00:02:05.939> happen<00:02:06.119> is<00:02:06.390> then<00:02:06.960> we<00:02:07.110> will<00:02:07.229> start

00:02:07.550 --> 00:02:07.560 
that should happen is then we will start

00:02:07.560 --> 00:02:10.429 
that should happen is then we will start
what<00:02:08.129> is<00:02:08.220> called<00:02:08.519> a<00:02:08.729> block<00:02:09.000> a<00:02:09.239> block<00:02:09.750> is<00:02:10.140> and

00:02:10.429 --> 00:02:10.439 
what is called a block a block is and

00:02:10.439 --> 00:02:11.509 
what is called a block a block is and

that<00:02:11.970> surrounds<00:02:12.959> different<00:02:13.680> actions<00:02:15.170> so<00:02:16.170> we

00:02:16.400 --> 00:02:16.410 
that surrounds different actions so we

00:02:16.410 --> 00:02:18.500 
that surrounds different actions so we
will<00:02:16.590> use<00:02:16.950> this<00:02:17.190> dart<00:02:17.580> block

00:02:18.500 --> 00:02:18.510 
will use this dart block

00:02:18.510 --> 00:02:20.960 
will use this dart block
and<00:02:18.599> we'll<00:02:18.780> also<00:02:19.110> to<00:02:19.349> add<00:02:19.830> this<00:02:20.069> end<00:02:20.370> block<00:02:20.700> and

00:02:20.960 --> 00:02:20.970 
and we'll also to add this end block and

00:02:20.970 --> 00:02:23.300 
and we'll also to add this end block and
everything<00:02:21.930> in<00:02:22.140> between<00:02:22.200> should<00:02:22.950> happen

00:02:23.300 --> 00:02:23.310 
everything in between should happen

00:02:23.310 --> 00:02:27.259 
everything in between should happen
whenever<00:02:23.670> lives<00:02:24.150> reached<00:02:24.689> zero<00:02:25.730> so<00:02:26.730> the<00:02:27.060> next

00:02:27.259 --> 00:02:27.269 
whenever lives reached zero so the next

00:02:27.269 --> 00:02:29.300 
whenever lives reached zero so the next
thing<00:02:27.510> that<00:02:27.540> should<00:02:27.959> happen<00:02:28.140> is<00:02:28.379> that<00:02:28.829> we<00:02:29.040> take

00:02:29.300 --> 00:02:29.310 
thing that should happen is that we take

00:02:29.310 --> 00:02:32.750 
thing that should happen is that we take
from<00:02:29.730> our<00:02:29.879> main<00:02:30.150> to<00:02:30.450> tap<00:02:30.959> this<00:02:31.760> message

00:02:32.750 --> 00:02:32.760 
from our main to tap this message

00:02:32.760 --> 00:02:36.289 
from our main to tap this message
display<00:02:33.420> message<00:02:33.810> function<00:02:34.370> so<00:02:35.370> add<00:02:35.579> this<00:02:35.940> in

00:02:36.289 --> 00:02:36.299 
display message function so add this in

00:02:36.299 --> 00:02:40.720 
display message function so add this in
between<00:02:36.810> the<00:02:36.959> block<00:02:37.170> and<00:02:37.440> say<00:02:38.280> game<00:02:39.260> ovah

set it here and draw set it here notice

00:04:02.549 --> 00:04:04.789 
set it here and draw set it here notice
how<00:04:02.940> they<00:04:03.329> don't<00:04:03.599> have<00:04:03.780> any<00:04:04.019> sprite<00:04:04.440> attached

00:04:07.490 --> 00:04:07.500 
so they just used the basic question

00:04:07.500 --> 00:04:10.189 
so they just used the basic question

00:04:19.339 --> 00:04:19.349 
finally the last thing we will go into

00:04:19.349 --> 00:04:23.149 
finally the last thing we will go into
the<00:04:19.560> ball<00:04:19.739> and<00:04:20.010> actually<00:04:20.579> set<00:04:21.419> it<00:04:21.590> to<00:04:22.590> give<00:04:23.130> a

here<00:04:41.610> is<00:04:41.760> that<00:04:41.790> we<00:04:42.000> quit

00:04:42.590 --> 00:04:42.600 
here is that we quit

00:04:42.600 --> 00:04:45.140 
here is that we quit
check<00:04:42.900> the<00:04:43.080> relative<00:04:43.560> marker<00:04:44.130> so<00:04:44.760> that<00:04:44.790> it

00:04:45.140 --> 00:04:45.150 
check the relative marker so that it

00:04:45.150 --> 00:04:49.100 
check the relative marker so that it
adds<00:04:45.440> 100<00:04:46.440> points<00:04:46.800> to<00:04:47.280> the<00:04:47.400> current<00:04:47.820> value<00:04:48.110> if

adds 100 points to the current value if
we<00:04:49.170> forget<00:04:49.920> about<00:04:49.950> this<00:04:50.340> then<00:04:50.760> it'll<00:04:51.030> just<00:04:51.060> set

00:04:51.890 --> 00:04:51.900 
we forget about this then it'll just set

00:04:51.900 --> 00:04:54.560 
we forget about this then it'll just set
our<00:04:52.200> score<00:04:52.560> to<00:04:52.740> 100<00:04:53.370> every<00:04:53.580> time<00:04:54.060> and<00:04:54.360> that

00:04:54.560 --> 00:04:54.570 
our score to 100 every time and that

00:04:54.570 --> 00:04:55.370 
our score to 100 every time and that
will<00:04:54.720> not<00:04:54.900> work

00:04:55.370 --> 00:04:55.380 
will not work

00:04:55.380 --> 00:04:59.600 
will not work
so<00:04:55.830> remember<00:04:56.640> relative<00:04:57.180> and<00:04:57.420> click<00:04:57.810> OK<00:04:58.610> also

so remember relative and click OK also

00:04:59.610 --> 00:05:01.730

whenever the ball goes outside the room
we<00:05:02.310> will<00:05:02.490> subtract<00:05:03.210> one<00:05:03.510> life<00:05:03.750> from<00:05:04.260> the

00:05:04.400 --> 00:05:04.410 
we will subtract one life from the

00:05:04.410 --> 00:05:07.220 
we will subtract one life from the
players<00:05:04.680> lives<00:05:05.190> count<00:05:05.550> so<00:05:06.240> use<00:05:06.750> this<00:05:06.990> set

00:05:07.220 --> 00:05:07.230 
players lives count so use this set

00:05:07.230 --> 00:05:12.980 
players lives count so use this set
lives<00:05:08.330> here<00:05:09.330> and<00:05:10.400> minus<00:05:11.400> one<00:05:11.940> and<00:05:12.150> of<00:05:12.720> course

00:05:12.980 --> 00:05:12.990 
lives here and minus one and of course

00:05:12.990 --> 00:05:15.290 
lives here and minus one and of course
relative<00:05:13.560> again<00:05:13.830> because<00:05:14.310> it's<00:05:14.550> according<00:05:15.090> to

00:05:15.290 --> 00:05:15.300 
relative again because it's according to

00:05:15.300 --> 00:05:18.890 
relative again because it's according to

00:05:18.890 --> 00:05:18.900 
the current value click OK ok and let's

00:05:18.900 --> 00:05:28.730
