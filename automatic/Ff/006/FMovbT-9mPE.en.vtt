roof<00:01:29.970> design<00:01:31.909> so<00:01:32.909> when<00:01:33.060> I<00:01:33.090> start<00:01:33.450> an<00:01:33.630> actual

00:01:33.890 --> 00:01:33.900 
roof design so when I start an actual

00:01:33.900 --> 00:01:34.940 
roof design so when I start an actual
building<00:01:34.229> project

00:01:34.940 --> 00:01:34.950 
building project

00:01:34.950 --> 00:01:37.670 
building project
I<00:01:34.979> hold<00:01:35.670> my<00:01:35.939> awareness<00:01:36.420> on<00:01:36.630> reducing<00:01:37.530> the

00:01:37.670 --> 00:01:37.680 
I hold my awareness on reducing the

00:01:37.680 --> 00:01:40.280 
I hold my awareness on reducing the
impact<00:01:38.240> lowering<00:01:39.240> the<00:01:39.390> embodied<00:01:39.810> energy<00:01:39.900> of

00:01:40.280 --> 00:01:40.290 
impact lowering the embodied energy of

00:01:40.290 --> 00:01:42.609 
impact lowering the embodied energy of
the<00:01:40.409> building<00:01:40.770> so<00:01:41.610> I<00:01:41.670> can<00:01:41.850> do<00:01:41.970> that<00:01:42.119> by

00:01:42.609 --> 00:01:42.619 
the building so I can do that by

00:01:42.619 --> 00:01:44.990 
the building so I can do that by
upcycling<00:01:43.619> taking<00:01:44.159> materials<00:01:44.670> that<00:01:44.850> are

00:01:44.990 --> 00:01:45.000 
upcycling taking materials that are

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:46.609 
upcycling taking materials that are
otherwise<00:01:45.329> a<00:01:45.450> waste<00:01:45.720> stream<00:01:45.869> and<00:01:46.290> re

00:01:46.609 --> 00:01:46.619 
otherwise a waste stream and re

00:01:46.619 --> 00:01:48.560 
otherwise a waste stream and re
incorporating<00:01:47.159> them<00:01:47.340> into<00:01:47.549> the<00:01:47.640> building<00:01:47.970> so

00:01:48.560 --> 00:01:48.570 
incorporating them into the building so

00:01:48.570 --> 00:01:50.300 
incorporating them into the building so
what<00:01:48.659> this<00:01:48.780> building<00:01:49.200> has<00:01:49.409> rigid<00:01:49.710> foam<00:01:49.950> tucked

00:01:50.300 --> 00:01:50.310 
what this building has rigid foam tucked

00:01:50.310 --> 00:01:52.999 
what this building has rigid foam tucked
into<00:01:50.460> the<00:01:50.790> walls<00:01:51.000> as<00:01:51.299> insulation<00:01:51.720> that<00:01:52.710> rigid

00:01:52.999 --> 00:01:53.009 
into the walls as insulation that rigid

00:01:53.009 --> 00:01:55.069 
into the walls as insulation that rigid
foam<00:01:53.250> was<00:01:53.549> already<00:01:54.030> used<00:01:54.299> in<00:01:54.509> a<00:01:54.600> factoring

00:01:55.069 --> 00:01:55.079 
foam was already used in a factoring

00:01:55.079 --> 00:01:58.399 
foam was already used in a factoring
down<00:01:55.290> in<00:01:55.409> st.<00:01:55.649> Louis<00:01:56.630> so<00:01:57.630> when<00:01:57.840> I<00:01:57.869> talk<00:01:58.140> about

00:01:58.399 --> 00:01:58.409

to come in and remove don't want the

00:04:01.630 --> 00:04:03.810 
to come in and remove don't want the
heat<00:04:02.079> to<00:04:02.110> come<00:04:02.290> in<00:04:02.440> close<00:04:02.920> those<00:04:03.280> windows<00:04:03.310> and

00:04:03.810 --> 00:04:03.820 
heat to come in close those windows and

00:04:03.820 --> 00:04:05.910 
heat to come in close those windows and
the<00:04:04.209> wall<00:04:04.360> is<00:04:04.480> still<00:04:04.660> very<00:04:04.810> insulative<00:04:05.320> so<00:04:05.829> in

00:04:05.910 --> 00:04:05.920 
the wall is still very insulative so in

00:04:05.920 --> 00:04:08.520 
the wall is still very insulative so in
a<00:04:05.980> straw<00:04:06.190> bale<00:04:06.340> home<00:04:06.640> we've<00:04:07.239> got<00:04:07.299> 18<00:04:07.959> inches<00:04:08.350> of

00:04:08.520 --> 00:04:08.530 
a straw bale home we've got 18 inches of

00:04:08.530 --> 00:04:10.830 
a straw bale home we've got 18 inches of
insulative<00:04:09.070> wall<00:04:09.340> material<00:04:09.910> that<00:04:10.510> means<00:04:10.660> we

00:04:10.830 --> 00:04:10.840 
insulative wall material that means we

00:04:10.840 --> 00:04:12.509 
insulative wall material that means we
can<00:04:10.989> choose<00:04:11.230> to<00:04:11.380> have<00:04:11.470> really<00:04:11.769> deep<00:04:11.890> sills<00:04:12.310> if

00:04:12.509 --> 00:04:12.519 
can choose to have really deep sills if

00:04:12.519 --> 00:04:14.460 
can choose to have really deep sills if
we<00:04:12.670> want<00:04:12.910> for<00:04:13.239> more<00:04:13.870> shelving<00:04:14.260> and<00:04:14.410> storage

00:04:14.460 --> 00:04:14.470 
we want for more shelving and storage

00:04:14.470 --> 00:04:17.400 
we want for more shelving and storage
space<00:04:15.010> or<00:04:15.370> in<00:04:16.000> a<00:04:16.150> lower<00:04:16.329> environment<00:04:16.989> makes<00:04:17.320> a

00:04:17.400 --> 00:04:17.410 
space or in a lower environment makes a

00:04:17.410 --> 00:04:20.130 
space or in a lower environment makes a
nice<00:04:17.590> bench<00:04:18.090> so<00:04:19.090> a<00:04:19.120> natural<00:04:19.630> building<00:04:19.989> is

00:04:20.130 --> 00:04:20.140 
nice bench so a natural building is

00:04:20.140 --> 00:04:21.779 
nice bench so a natural building is
built<00:04:20.410> with<00:04:20.530> a<00:04:20.560> strong<00:04:20.890> focus<00:04:21.130> on<00:04:21.370> low

00:04:21.779 --> 00:04:21.789 
built with a strong focus on low

00:04:21.789 --> 00:04:22.960 
built with a strong focus on low
embodied<00:04:21.970> energy

00:04:22.960 --> 00:04:22.970 
embodied energy

00:04:22.970 --> 00:04:26.710 
embodied energy
so<00:04:23.570> a<00:04:23.600> straw<00:04:24.050> bale<00:04:24.200> wall<00:04:24.530> usually<00:04:25.310> is<00:04:25.730> straw

00:04:26.710 --> 00:04:26.720 
so a straw bale wall usually is straw

00:04:26.720 --> 00:04:30.010 
so a straw bale wall usually is straw
that<00:04:27.110> has<00:04:27.260> come<00:04:27.530> from<00:04:28.280> a<00:04:28.490> very<00:04:28.670> few<00:04:29.210> miles<00:04:29.750> away

00:04:30.010 --> 00:04:30.020 
that has come from a very few miles away

00:04:30.020 --> 00:04:32.890 
that has come from a very few miles away
very<00:04:30.830> close<00:04:31.190> to<00:04:31.430> the<00:04:31.550> property<00:04:31.700> so<00:04:32.660> there's<00:04:32.840> a

00:04:32.890 --> 00:04:32.900 
very close to the property so there's a

00:04:32.900 --> 00:04:35.110 
very close to the property so there's a
love<00:04:33.110> embodied<00:04:33.560> energy<00:04:33.680> in<00:04:34.220> that<00:04:34.430> straw<00:04:34.820> it

00:04:35.110 --> 00:04:35.120 
love embodied energy in that straw it

00:04:35.120 --> 00:04:36.790 
love embodied energy in that straw it
didn't<00:04:35.420> have<00:04:35.540> to<00:04:35.630> get<00:04:35.780> transported<00:04:36.170> very<00:04:36.530> far

00:04:36.790 --> 00:04:36.800 
didn't have to get transported very far

00:04:36.800 --> 00:04:40.000 
didn't have to get transported very far
and<00:04:37.040> it<00:04:37.610> was<00:04:37.700> fairly<00:04:37.940> easy<00:04:38.060> to<00:04:38.360> grow<00:04:38.860> so<00:04:39.860> that's

00:04:40.000 --> 00:04:40.010 
and it was fairly easy to grow so that's

00:04:40.010 --> 00:04:41.320 
and it was fairly easy to grow so that's
called<00:04:40.220> a<00:04:40.370> truth<00:04:40.640> window

00:04:41.320 --> 00:04:41.330 
called a truth window

00:04:41.330 --> 00:04:44.170 
called a truth window
it's<00:04:41.990> a<00:04:42.230> rotted<00:04:42.830> out<00:04:42.920> piece<00:04:43.190> of<00:04:43.340> elm<00:04:43.610> with<00:04:44.150> a
