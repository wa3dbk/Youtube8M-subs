Galaxy s5 we don't really know where you
got<00:02:12.420> it<00:02:12.480> from<00:02:12.690> but<00:02:12.810> they<00:02:12.960> certainly<00:02:13.140> do<00:02:13.500> look

00:02:13.700 --> 00:02:13.710 
got it from but they certainly do look

00:02:13.710 --> 00:02:16.010 
got it from but they certainly do look
like<00:02:13.890> a<00:02:14.010> Samsung<00:02:14.430> device<00:02:14.730> and<00:02:15.030> it<00:02:15.480> does<00:02:15.720> appear

00:02:16.010 --> 00:02:16.020 
like a Samsung device and it does appear

00:02:16.020 --> 00:02:17.720 
like a Samsung device and it does appear
to<00:02:16.140> have<00:02:16.230> a<00:02:16.290> spot<00:02:16.590> where<00:02:16.770> an<00:02:16.860> IR<00:02:17.160> blaster<00:02:17.580> would

00:02:17.720 --> 00:02:17.730 
to have a spot where an IR blaster would

00:02:17.730 --> 00:02:19.820 
to have a spot where an IR blaster would
sit<00:02:17.910> in<00:02:17.940> the<00:02:18.030> top<00:02:18.210> of<00:02:18.240> the<00:02:18.420> phone<00:02:18.690> however<00:02:19.500> a

sit in the top of the phone however a

00:02:19.830 --> 00:02:21.949 
sit in the top of the phone however a

00:02:21.949 --> 00:02:21.959 
wide area below the camera suggests that

00:02:21.959 --> 00:02:23.600 
wide area below the camera suggests that
there<00:02:22.290> could<00:02:22.440> be<00:02:22.470> a<00:02:22.560> room<00:02:22.770> for<00:02:22.950> a<00:02:23.010> dual<00:02:23.250> LED

00:02:23.600 --> 00:02:23.610 
there could be a room for a dual LED

00:02:23.610 --> 00:02:26.270 
there could be a room for a dual LED
flash<00:02:23.870> getting<00:02:24.870> more<00:02:25.050> analytical<00:02:25.830> it<00:02:25.980> also

00:02:26.270 --> 00:02:26.280 
flash getting more analytical it also

00:02:26.280 --> 00:02:27.620 
flash getting more analytical it also
looks<00:02:26.459> like<00:02:26.580> there<00:02:26.760> could<00:02:26.790> be<00:02:26.940> a<00:02:27.030> hatch<00:02:27.330> of<00:02:27.570> the

00:02:27.620 --> 00:02:27.630 
looks like there could be a hatch of the

00:02:29.900 --> 00:02:29.910 
micro USB charging port which ends like

00:02:29.910 --> 00:02:31.130 
micro USB charging port which ends like
hasn't<00:02:30.240> used<00:02:30.360> on<00:02:30.510> any<00:02:30.630> of<00:02:30.750> its<00:02:30.840> flashier

00:02:31.130 --> 00:02:31.140 
hasn't used on any of its flashier

00:02:31.140 --> 00:02:32.990 
hasn't used on any of its flashier
devices<00:02:31.590> for<00:02:31.830> that<00:02:31.950> reason<00:02:32.160> it<00:02:32.430> looks<00:02:32.580> like<00:02:32.880> it

00:02:32.990 --> 00:02:33.000 
devices for that reason it looks like it

00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:34.850 
devices for that reason it looks like it
might<00:02:33.120> be<00:02:33.270> something<00:02:33.510> different<00:02:33.660> my<00:02:34.590> bet<00:02:34.830> and

00:02:34.850 --> 00:02:34.860 
might be something different my bet and

00:02:34.860 --> 00:02:37.040 
might be something different my bet and
my<00:02:35.190> money<00:02:35.489> has<00:02:35.760> that<00:02:35.940> being<00:02:36.150> a<00:02:36.180> galaxy<00:02:36.660> s5

00:02:37.040 --> 00:02:37.050 
my money has that being a galaxy s5

00:02:37.050 --> 00:02:38.750 
my money has that being a galaxy s5
active<00:02:37.650> which<00:02:38.130> would<00:02:38.250> certainly<00:02:38.489> have<00:02:38.610> to

00:02:38.750 --> 00:02:38.760 
active which would certainly have to

00:02:38.760 --> 00:02:40.670 
active which would certainly have to
have<00:02:38.940> the<00:02:39.150> port<00:02:39.420> cover<00:02:39.630> to<00:02:39.750> keep<00:02:39.870> water<00:02:40.110> out<00:02:40.290> or

00:02:40.670 --> 00:02:40.680 
have the port cover to keep water out or

00:02:40.680 --> 00:02:42.560 
have the port cover to keep water out or
at<00:02:40.770> least<00:02:40.800> try<00:02:41.280> to<00:02:41.310> keep<00:02:41.700> the<00:02:41.850> water<00:02:41.970> out<00:02:42.120> my

00:02:42.560 --> 00:02:42.570 
at least try to keep the water out my

00:02:42.570 --> 00:02:44.090 
at least try to keep the water out my
hope<00:02:42.720> though<00:02:42.900> is<00:02:42.959> that<00:02:43.080> it's<00:02:43.290> the<00:02:43.410> active<00:02:43.770> and

00:02:44.090 --> 00:02:44.100 
hope though is that it's the active and

00:02:44.100 --> 00:02:45.949 
hope though is that it's the active and
will<00:02:44.489> look<00:02:44.640> different<00:02:44.820> when<00:02:45.450> we<00:02:45.540> finally<00:02:45.750> get

00:02:45.949 --> 00:02:45.959 
will look different when we finally get

00:02:45.959 --> 00:02:48.199 
will look different when we finally get
to<00:02:46.080> see<00:02:46.230> the<00:02:46.410> regular<00:02:46.620> galaxy<00:02:47.310> s5<00:02:47.610> that<00:02:48.000> will

00:02:48.199 --> 00:02:48.209 
to see the regular galaxy s5 that will

00:02:48.209 --> 00:02:49.250 
to see the regular galaxy s5 that will
get<00:02:48.360> damaged<00:02:48.630> when<00:02:48.720> you<00:02:48.810> throw<00:02:48.930> it<00:02:49.050> in<00:02:49.110> water

00:02:49.250 --> 00:02:49.260 
get damaged when you throw it in water

00:02:49.260 --> 00:02:51.320 
get damaged when you throw it in water
so<00:02:49.680> this<00:02:49.800> is<00:02:49.830> a<00:02:49.980> crazy<00:02:50.340> awesome<00:02:50.790> time<00:02:51.150> for

00:02:51.320 --> 00:02:51.330 
so this is a crazy awesome time for

00:02:51.330 --> 00:02:53.479 
so this is a crazy awesome time for
technology<00:02:51.840> TVs<00:02:52.260> are<00:02:52.560> getting<00:02:52.890> curves<00:02:53.220> and

00:02:53.479 --> 00:02:53.489 
technology TVs are getting curves and

00:02:53.489 --> 00:02:55.490 
technology TVs are getting curves and
soon<00:02:53.730> phones<00:02:54.030> will<00:02:54.300> start<00:02:54.570> to<00:02:54.660> have<00:02:54.780> bends<00:02:55.110> and

00:02:55.490 --> 00:02:55.500 
soon phones will start to have bends and

00:02:55.500 --> 00:02:58.699 
soon phones will start to have bends and
maybe<00:02:55.770> even<00:02:56.070> fold<00:02:56.580> which<00:02:57.270> really<00:02:57.690> starting<00:02:58.650> a

before<00:03:05.910> you<00:03:06.120> start<00:03:06.420> drooling<00:03:07.080> like<00:03:07.290> I<00:03:07.590> was

00:03:07.850 --> 00:03:07.860 
before you start drooling like I was

00:03:07.860 --> 00:03:09.740 
before you start drooling like I was
over<00:03:08.459> the<00:03:08.549> idea<00:03:08.790> of<00:03:08.880> a<00:03:08.940> foldable<00:03:09.239> smartphone<00:03:09.720> I

00:03:09.740 --> 00:03:09.750 
over the idea of a foldable smartphone I

00:03:09.750 --> 00:03:11.300 
over the idea of a foldable smartphone I
should<00:03:10.049> throw<00:03:10.260> water<00:03:10.620> in<00:03:10.769> your<00:03:10.920> party<00:03:11.220> and

00:03:11.300 --> 00:03:11.310 
should throw water in your party and

00:03:11.310 --> 00:03:13.340 
should throw water in your party and
clarify<00:03:11.760> that<00:03:11.910> Samsung's<00:03:12.390> bent<00:03:12.750> smartphone

00:03:13.340 --> 00:03:13.350

00:03:13.350 --> 00:03:15.050 
clarify that Samsung's bent smartphone
isn't<00:03:13.890> really<00:03:14.310> what<00:03:14.459> you<00:03:14.580> really<00:03:14.700> think<00:03:14.880> it<00:03:15.030> is

00:03:15.050 --> 00:03:15.060 
isn't really what you really think it is

00:03:15.060 --> 00:03:17.300 
isn't really what you really think it is
so<00:03:15.480> unlike<00:03:15.780> a<00:03:15.810> regular<00:03:15.930> slate<00:03:16.709> phone<00:03:17.130> the
