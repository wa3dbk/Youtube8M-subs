00:01:44.229 --> 00:01:46.440
 carrots 

00:01:51.480 --> 00:01:55.980
 then we cut them up roughly and the 

00:01:54.150 --> 00:01:58.850
 we will introduce in a mincer together with 

00:01:55.980 --> 00:01:58.850

 we will marry the three eggs in a bowl and 

00:02:31.840 --> 00:02:34.350
 we will beat them 

00:02:40.510 --> 00:02:44.939
 and we will mix them with the ingredients 

00:02:42.549 --> 00:02:44.939
 chopped 

00:03:01.010 --> 00:03:05.120
 in the same container we will add the 

00:03:03.170 --> 00:03:07.450
 mix the flour bowl and we'll go back to 

00:03:05.120 --> 00:03:07.450
 Mix 

00:03:13.819 --> 00:03:17.900
 finally we will add 12 tablespoons of 

00:03:16.219 --> 00:03:21.310
 extra virgin olive oil to the set 

00:03:17.900 --> 00:03:21.310
 and we will mix again 

00:03:29.210 --> 00:03:33.050
 we will enter the molds with oil 

00:03:31.220 --> 00:03:35.350
 extra virgin olive with the help of a 

00:03:33.050 --> 00:03:35.350
 brush 

00:03:52.200 --> 00:03:57.650
 we will introduce the mixture in the molds 

00:03:54.090 --> 00:03:57.650
 without actually fill them all 

00:04:06.940 --> 00:04:14.790
 preheat the oven 5 minutes to 175 

00:04:10.240 --> 00:04:14.790
 degrees and we bake for 35 minutes 

00:04:15.600 --> 00:04:20.610
 meanwhile we will prepare the frosting 

00:04:18.290 --> 00:04:23.310
 will warm oat milk until 

00:04:20.610 --> 00:04:25.470
 boil then we will lower the fire to 

00:04:23.310 --> 00:04:28.440
 minimum and we will introduce 6 tablespoons of 

00:04:25.470 --> 00:04:29.940
 cornstarch we will mix the whole with a 

00:04:28.440 --> 00:04:32.270
 beater of rods until the milk 

00:04:29.940 --> 00:04:32.270
 thicken 

00:04:47.710 --> 00:04:52.150
 we will remove from the fire and introduce 

00:04:49.930 --> 00:04:53.380
 in a bag of infuse three 

00:04:52.150 --> 00:04:55.590
 spoonfuls of dried leaves of this 

00:04:53.380 --> 00:04:55.590
 Friday 

00:04:56.529 --> 00:05:02.759
 immerse in the mixture and we will cover 

00:04:59.259 --> 00:05:02.759
 let stand for 5 minutes 

00:05:06.610 --> 00:05:10.449
 fulfilled the time we will discover the 

00:05:08.680 --> 00:05:12.610
 sachet to extract all the juice from the 

00:05:10.449 --> 00:05:15.569
 stevia leaves and we will mix so that 

00:05:12.610 --> 00:05:15.569
 frosting looks good 

00:05:27.080 --> 00:05:31.900
 we will remove the cakes from the oven and 

00:05:29.120 --> 00:05:31.900
 let's cool 

00:05:34.350 --> 00:05:38.430
 then we will remove it from the mold and 

00:05:36.690 --> 00:05:40.230
 we'll start swimming the top 

00:05:38.430 --> 00:05:42.710
 with our frosting sweetened with 

00:05:40.230 --> 00:05:42.710
 stevia 

00:05:49.360 --> 00:05:53.219
 decorate with mint leaves 

00:06:02.050 --> 00:06:06.430
 what did you think the carrot was easy 

00:06:05.020 --> 00:06:08.020
 It has been used in sweet cases from the 

00:06:06.430 --> 00:06:10.289
 mean since it was easier to find 

00:06:08.020 --> 00:06:13.120
 and other more expensive and scarce sweeteners 

00:06:10.289 --> 00:06:14.860
 this pie resurfaced in the united kingdom 

00:06:13.120 --> 00:06:16.990
 thanks to rationing in the second 

00:06:14.860 --> 00:06:19.599
 world war and it expanded us to 

00:06:16.990 --> 00:06:23.400
 early 60's waited on them in 

00:06:19.599 --> 00:06:23.400
 the next recipe at all times 

00:06:25.270 --> 00:06:28.050
