and<00:03:40.959> we<00:03:41.050> followed<00:03:41.380> up<00:03:41.470> you<00:03:41.680> know<00:03:41.830> so<00:03:42.160> the<00:03:42.310> bids

00:03:42.449 --> 00:03:42.459 
and we followed up you know so the bids

00:03:42.459 --> 00:03:45.380 
and we followed up you know so the bids
have<00:03:42.550> been<00:03:42.720> drilled<00:03:43.720> out<00:03:43.870> just<00:03:44.170> maximizing

00:03:45.380 --> 00:03:45.390 
have been drilled out just maximizing

00:03:45.390 --> 00:03:47.250 
have been drilled out just maximizing
basically<00:03:46.390> the<00:03:46.480> goals<00:03:46.660> of<00:03:46.780> this<00:03:46.900> group<00:03:47.080> with

00:03:47.250 --> 00:03:47.260 
basically the goals of this group with

00:03:47.260 --> 00:03:49.860 
basically the goals of this group with
Drupal<00:03:47.940> maximizing<00:03:48.940> our<00:03:49.030> technology<00:03:49.600> so<00:03:49.750> when

00:03:49.860 --> 00:03:49.870 
Drupal maximizing our technology so when

00:03:49.870 --> 00:03:52.260 
Drupal maximizing our technology so when
you<00:03:49.930> talk<00:03:50.080> about<00:03:50.110> double<00:03:50.650> tap<00:03:51.060> and<00:03:52.060> things

00:03:52.260 --> 00:03:52.270 
you talk about double tap and things

00:03:52.270 --> 00:03:54.240 
you talk about double tap and things
like<00:03:52.390> that<00:03:52.450> at<00:03:52.810> exec<00:03:53.140> actuation<00:03:53.740> we<00:03:53.890> wanted<00:03:54.130> to

00:03:54.240 --> 00:03:54.250 
like that at exec actuation we wanted to

00:03:54.250 --> 00:03:55.890 
like that at exec actuation we wanted to
perfect<00:03:54.790> those<00:03:55.030> make<00:03:55.300> them<00:03:55.450> as<00:03:55.540> good<00:03:55.720> as

00:03:55.890 --> 00:03:55.900 
perfect those make them as good as

00:03:55.900 --> 00:03:57.690 
perfect those make them as good as
possible<00:03:56.890> and<00:03:56.980> we<00:03:57.100> spent<00:03:57.310> a<00:03:57.370> lot<00:03:57.400> of<00:03:57.580> time

00:03:57.690 --> 00:03:57.700 
possible and we spent a lot of time

00:03:57.700 --> 00:04:02.130 
possible and we spent a lot of time
focused<00:03:58.450> on<00:03:58.600> refining<00:03:59.670> every<00:04:00.670> bit<00:04:00.880> of<00:04:01.140> those

00:04:02.130 --> 00:04:02.140 
focused on refining every bit of those

00:04:02.140 --> 00:04:04.920 
focused on refining every bit of those
technology<00:04:02.650> so<00:04:02.830> when<00:04:02.980> you<00:04:03.040> talk<00:04:03.220> about<00:04:03.930> double

00:04:04.920 --> 00:04:04.930 
technology so when you talk about double

00:04:04.930 --> 00:04:07.080 
technology so when you talk about double
tap<00:04:05.110> now<00:04:05.320> you<00:04:05.709> have<00:04:05.890> essentially<00:04:06.580> zero<00:04:06.610> loss

00:04:07.080 --> 00:04:07.090 
tap now you have essentially zero loss

00:04:07.090 --> 00:04:09.000 
tap now you have essentially zero loss
with<00:04:07.360> double<00:04:07.570> tap<00:04:07.720> we<00:04:07.900> had<00:04:08.050> a<00:04:08.290> few<00:04:08.560> degrees<00:04:08.680> of

00:04:09.000 --> 00:04:09.010 
with double tap we had a few degrees of

00:04:09.010 --> 00:04:11.010 
with double tap we had a few degrees of
locks<00:04:09.280> where<00:04:09.640> you<00:04:09.790> start<00:04:10.120> to<00:04:10.330> engage<00:04:10.480> shifts

00:04:11.010 --> 00:04:11.020 
locks where you start to engage shifts

00:04:11.020 --> 00:04:13.080 
locks where you start to engage shifts
and<00:04:11.739> the<00:04:11.920> paddle<00:04:12.190> move<00:04:12.400> in<00:04:12.550> and<00:04:12.820> it's<00:04:12.940> just

00:04:13.080 --> 00:04:13.090 
and the paddle move in and it's just

00:04:13.090 --> 00:04:15.570 
and the paddle move in and it's just
kind<00:04:13.360> of<00:04:13.390> wasted<00:04:13.780> space<00:04:14.070> it's<00:04:15.070> not<00:04:15.220> you<00:04:15.550> know

00:04:15.570 --> 00:04:15.580 
kind of wasted space it's not you know

00:04:15.580 --> 00:04:17.070 
kind of wasted space it's not you know
it's<00:04:15.910> not<00:04:16.030> a<00:04:16.090> negative<00:04:16.299> thing<00:04:16.510> it's<00:04:16.750> just<00:04:16.930> in

00:04:17.070 --> 00:04:17.080 
it's not a negative thing it's just in

00:04:17.080 --> 00:04:18.900 
it's not a negative thing it's just in
terms<00:04:17.229> of<00:04:17.440> in<00:04:17.950> terms<00:04:18.010> of<00:04:18.250> this<00:04:18.430> we<00:04:18.549> have<00:04:18.669> zero

00:04:18.900 --> 00:04:18.910 
terms of in terms of this we have zero

00:04:18.910 --> 00:04:19.890 
terms of in terms of this we have zero
also<00:04:19.299> the<00:04:19.390> shifts

00:04:19.890 --> 00:04:19.900 
also the shifts

00:04:19.900 --> 00:04:23.490 
also the shifts
our<00:04:20.530> engagement<00:04:21.040> immediately<00:04:21.430> so<00:04:22.229> so<00:04:23.229> terms

00:04:23.490 --> 00:04:23.500 
our engagement immediately so so terms

00:04:23.500 --> 00:04:25.020 
our engagement immediately so so terms
of<00:04:23.620> maximizing<00:04:23.940> maximizing<00:04:24.940> our

00:04:25.020 --> 00:04:25.030 
of maximizing maximizing our

00:04:25.030 --> 00:04:27.090 
of maximizing maximizing our
technologies<00:04:25.600> that<00:04:25.810> moves<00:04:26.050> into<00:04:26.259> maximizing

00:04:27.090 --> 00:04:27.100 
technologies that moves into maximizing

00:04:27.100 --> 00:04:29.189 
technologies that moves into maximizing
efficiency<00:04:27.280> efficiency<00:04:28.150> on<00:04:28.539> the<00:04:28.630> bike<00:04:28.780> is<00:04:28.960> a

00:04:29.189 --> 00:04:29.199 
efficiency efficiency on the bike is a

00:04:29.199 --> 00:04:30.629 
efficiency efficiency on the bike is a
big<00:04:29.410> thing<00:04:29.560> so<00:04:29.770> when<00:04:29.919> you<00:04:29.979> talk<00:04:30.130> about<00:04:30.160> wasted

00:04:30.629 --> 00:04:30.639 
big thing so when you talk about wasted

00:04:30.639 --> 00:04:32.370 
big thing so when you talk about wasted
motion<00:04:30.789> there's<00:04:31.360> no<00:04:31.479> wasted<00:04:31.810> motion<00:04:31.840> in<00:04:32.199> terms

00:04:32.370 --> 00:04:32.380 
motion there's no wasted motion in terms

00:04:32.380 --> 00:04:35.070 
motion there's no wasted motion in terms
of<00:04:32.470> this<00:04:32.590> ship<00:04:32.800> and<00:04:33.009> also<00:04:33.940> the<00:04:34.270> final<00:04:34.509> focus

00:04:35.070 --> 00:04:35.080 
of this ship and also the final focus

00:04:35.080 --> 00:04:38.820 
of this ship and also the final focus

00:04:50.129 --> 00:04:50.139 
are the three things technologies

00:04:50.139 --> 00:04:53.580 
are the three things technologies
