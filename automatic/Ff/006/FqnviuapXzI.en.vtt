that<00:00:19.350> point<00:00:19.670> yeah<00:00:20.670> I<00:00:20.699> mean<00:00:21.029> you<00:00:21.510> know<00:00:21.539> I<00:00:21.689> think

00:00:21.830 --> 00:00:21.840 
that point yeah I mean you know I think

00:00:21.840 --> 00:00:23.779 
that point yeah I mean you know I think
that<00:00:22.199> we<00:00:22.410> were<00:00:22.529> we<00:00:22.740> were<00:00:22.890> coming<00:00:23.279> and<00:00:23.400> we<00:00:23.670> had

00:00:23.779 --> 00:00:23.789 
that we were we were coming and we had

00:00:23.789 --> 00:00:25.009 
that we were we were coming and we had
some<00:00:23.970> energy<00:00:24.269> we<00:00:24.359> had<00:00:24.449> added<00:00:24.630> quite<00:00:24.779> a<00:00:24.810> few

00:00:25.009 --> 00:00:25.019 
some energy we had added quite a few

00:00:25.019 --> 00:00:27.890 
some energy we had added quite a few
snaps<00:00:25.289> anyway<00:00:25.710> but<00:00:26.070> thought<00:00:27.029> our<00:00:27.150> guys<00:00:27.300> kept

00:00:27.890 --> 00:00:27.900

00:01:19.810 --> 00:01:19.820 

00:01:19.820 --> 00:01:21.830 

that's<00:01:20.820> a<00:01:20.910> different<00:01:21.270> deal<00:01:21.390> because<00:01:21.570> that<00:01:21.750> one

00:01:21.830 --> 00:01:21.840 
that's a different deal because that one

00:01:21.840 --> 00:01:23.150 
that's a different deal because that one
was<00:01:21.960> in<00:01:22.080> the<00:01:22.170> end<00:01:22.290> zone<00:01:22.350> this<00:01:22.590> one<00:01:22.770> was<00:01:22.920> fourth

00:01:23.150 --> 00:01:23.160 
was in the end zone this one was fourth

00:01:23.160 --> 00:01:25.490 
was in the end zone this one was fourth
in<00:01:23.250> 18<00:01:23.640> and<00:01:23.940> then<00:01:24.750> we<00:01:24.840> need<00:01:24.960> a<00:01:25.020> field<00:01:25.320> goal

00:01:25.490 --> 00:01:25.500 
in 18 and then we need a field goal

00:01:25.500 --> 00:01:28.460 
in 18 and then we need a field goal
whereas<00:01:26.370> aj<00:01:26.790> green's<00:01:27.090> was<00:01:27.300> thought<00:01:27.510> in<00:01:27.690> the<00:01:28.050> in

00:01:28.460 --> 00:01:28.470 
whereas aj green's was thought in the in

00:01:28.470 --> 00:01:29.810 
whereas aj green's was thought in the in
the<00:01:28.530> end<00:01:28.830> zone<00:01:28.920> so<00:01:29.190> you're<00:01:29.280> going<00:01:29.370> to<00:01:29.430> box<00:01:29.640> them

00:01:29.810 --> 00:01:29.820 
the end zone so you're going to box them

00:01:29.820 --> 00:01:31.190 
the end zone so you're going to box them
out<00:01:30.000> and<00:01:30.120> knock<00:01:30.270> it<00:01:30.420> down<00:01:30.540> all<00:01:30.810> that<00:01:30.930> kind<00:01:31.170> of

00:01:31.190 --> 00:01:31.200 
out and knock it down all that kind of

00:01:31.200 --> 00:01:33.469 
out and knock it down all that kind of
stuff<00:01:31.260> here<00:01:31.650> its<00:01:31.800> fourth<00:01:32.010> and<00:01:32.160> 18<00:01:32.520> then<00:01:33.330> they

00:01:33.469 --> 00:01:33.479 
stuff here its fourth and 18 then they

00:01:33.479 --> 00:01:34.490 
stuff here its fourth and 18 then they
can<00:01:33.630> throw<00:01:33.780> it<00:01:33.900> anywhere<00:01:34.110> and<00:01:34.440> you're

00:01:34.490 --> 00:01:34.500 
can throw it anywhere and you're

00:01:34.500 --> 00:01:36.020 
can throw it anywhere and you're

00:03:22.100 --> 00:03:24.310 
you continue to try to get them to
develop<00:03:22.489> on<00:03:22.850> that<00:03:23.000> part<00:03:23.239> I<00:03:23.480> think<00:03:23.840> that<00:03:24.019> today

00:03:24.310 --> 00:03:24.320 
develop on that part I think that today

00:03:24.320 --> 00:03:25.600 
develop on that part I think that today
showed<00:03:24.650> that<00:03:24.829> they<00:03:24.920> got<00:03:25.100> mental<00:03:25.370> toughness

00:03:25.600 --> 00:03:25.610 
showed that they got mental toughness

00:03:25.610 --> 00:03:27.490 
showed that they got mental toughness
because<00:03:26.150> it<00:03:26.570> was<00:03:26.720> obviously<00:03:27.049> wasn't<00:03:27.290> good

00:03:27.490 --> 00:03:27.500 
because it was obviously wasn't good

00:03:27.500 --> 00:03:30.069 
because it was obviously wasn't good
early<00:03:27.769> and<00:03:27.890> they<00:03:27.950> kept<00:03:28.190> battling<00:03:28.220> and<00:03:29.079> laying

00:03:30.069 --> 00:03:30.079 
early and they kept battling and laying

00:03:30.079 --> 00:03:32.800 
early and they kept battling and laying
it<00:03:30.110> was<00:03:30.260> 34<00:03:30.650> 17<00:03:31.040> and<00:03:31.430> we<00:03:31.670> kept<00:03:31.940> battling<00:03:32.090> and<00:03:32.570> we

00:03:32.800 --> 00:03:32.810 
it was 34 17 and we kept battling and we

00:03:32.810 --> 00:03:34.270 
it was 34 17 and we kept battling and we
got<00:03:32.959> the<00:03:33.109> ball<00:03:33.290> back<00:03:33.320> with<00:03:33.530> a<00:03:33.739> chance<00:03:34.010> to<00:03:34.130> win

00:03:34.270 --> 00:03:34.280 
got the ball back with a chance to win

00:03:34.280 --> 00:03:36.190 
got the ball back with a chance to win
the<00:03:34.310> game<00:03:34.400> we<00:03:34.730> get<00:03:34.820> it<00:03:34.970> up<00:03:35.150> and<00:03:35.359> then<00:03:35.900> we<00:03:35.989> got<00:03:36.140> in

00:03:36.190 --> 00:03:36.200 
the game we get it up and then we got in

00:03:36.200 --> 00:03:37.780 
the game we get it up and then we got in
the<00:03:36.290> fourth<00:03:36.470> and<00:03:36.590> 18<00:03:36.859> and<00:03:37.010> win<00:03:37.100> the<00:03:37.190> game<00:03:37.340> so<00:03:37.760> I

00:03:37.780 --> 00:03:37.790 
the fourth and 18 and win the game so I

00:03:37.790 --> 00:03:39.250 
the fourth and 18 and win the game so I
mean<00:03:38.060> to<00:03:38.329> me<00:03:38.420> that<00:03:38.600> shows<00:03:38.780> a<00:03:38.810> lot<00:03:38.930> of<00:03:39.019> mental

00:03:39.250 --> 00:03:39.260 
mean to me that shows a lot of mental

00:03:39.260 --> 00:03:40.810 
mean to me that shows a lot of mental
toughness<00:03:39.470> we<00:03:40.190> didn't<00:03:40.400> execute<00:03:40.489> the

00:03:40.810 --> 00:03:40.820 
toughness we didn't execute the

00:03:40.820 --> 00:03:44.080 
toughness we didn't execute the
situation<00:03:41.359> air<00:03:41.480> to<00:03:41.660> finish<00:03:42.049> the<00:03:42.200> game<00:03:42.380> so<00:03:43.220> we

00:03:44.080 --> 00:03:44.090 
situation air to finish the game so we

00:03:44.090 --> 00:03:48.489 
situation air to finish the game so we
learn<00:03:44.239> from<00:03:44.329> that<00:03:44.570> and<00:03:44.630> move<00:03:44.840> on<00:03:45.489> huh
