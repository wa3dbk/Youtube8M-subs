the<00:00:27.210> thing<00:00:27.449> is<00:00:28.220> Dawson's<00:00:29.220> young<00:00:29.429> and<00:00:29.640> hungry

00:00:29.810 --> 00:00:29.820 
the thing is Dawson's young and hungry

00:00:29.820 --> 00:00:34.479 
the thing is Dawson's young and hungry
and<00:00:30.349> in<00:00:31.349> his<00:00:31.529> prime<00:00:32.239> Hopkins<00:00:33.239> is<00:00:33.360> 47<00:00:34.020> years<00:00:34.200> old

00:00:34.479 --> 00:00:34.489 
and in his prime Hopkins is 47 years old

00:00:34.489 --> 00:00:38.209 
and in his prime Hopkins is 47 years old
so<00:00:35.489> I<00:00:35.790> would<00:00:36.149> almost<00:00:36.300> go<00:00:36.750> maybe<00:00:37.500> Dawson<00:00:38.070> by<00:00:38.190> a

00:00:38.209 --> 00:00:38.219 
so I would almost go maybe Dawson by a

00:00:38.219 --> 00:00:42.650 
so I would almost go maybe Dawson by a
decision<00:00:38.610> but<00:00:40.520> Hopkins<00:00:41.520> any<00:00:42.000> time<00:00:42.239> I<00:00:42.270> doubt

00:00:42.650 --> 00:00:42.660 
decision but Hopkins any time I doubt

00:00:42.660 --> 00:00:44.389 
decision but Hopkins any time I doubt
him<00:00:42.899> like<00:00:43.170> I<00:00:43.260> thought<00:00:43.440> tava<00:00:43.920> could<00:00:44.100> beat<00:00:44.280> him

00:00:44.389 --> 00:00:44.399

opinions for a few people you think yeah

00:01:34.070 --> 00:01:36.280 
opinions for a few people you think yeah
you<00:01:34.580> know<00:01:34.670> chance<00:01:34.940> an<00:01:35.090> angry<00:01:35.360> guy<00:01:35.570> sometimes

00:01:36.280 --> 00:01:36.290 
you know chance an angry guy sometimes

00:01:36.290 --> 00:01:38.260 
you know chance an angry guy sometimes
it's<00:01:36.650> not<00:01:36.800> good<00:01:37.070> to<00:01:37.100> go<00:01:37.310> into<00:01:37.490> a<00:01:37.610> fight<00:01:37.880> angry

00:01:38.260 --> 00:01:38.270 
it's not good to go into a fight angry

00:01:38.270 --> 00:01:40.120 
it's not good to go into a fight angry
because<00:01:38.600> the<00:01:38.870> motion<00:01:39.260> can<00:01:39.410> overshadow<00:01:39.830> what

00:01:40.120 --> 00:01:40.130 
because the motion can overshadow what

00:01:40.130 --> 00:01:41.440 
because the motion can overshadow what
you<00:01:40.280> need<00:01:40.460> to<00:01:40.550> do<00:01:40.670> make<00:01:40.850> you<00:01:40.970> make<00:01:41.150> a<00:01:41.180> lot<00:01:41.420> of

00:01:41.440 --> 00:01:41.450 
you need to do make you make a lot of

00:01:41.450 --> 00:01:46.180 
you need to do make you make a lot of
bad<00:01:41.930> mistakes<00:01:43.930> yeah<00:01:44.930> but<00:01:45.110> I<00:01:45.140> still<00:01:45.619> think

00:01:46.180 --> 00:01:46.190 
bad mistakes yeah but I still think

00:01:46.190 --> 00:01:49.180 
bad mistakes yeah but I still think
though<00:01:46.430> that<00:01:46.780> you<00:01:47.780> know<00:01:47.900> his<00:01:48.050> age<00:01:48.200> is<00:01:48.740> going<00:01:48.800> to

00:01:49.180 --> 00:01:49.190 
though that you know his age is going to

00:01:49.190 --> 00:01:52.600 
though that you know his age is going to
be<00:01:49.340> his<00:01:49.670> biggest<00:01:50.450> advantage<00:01:51.170> and<00:01:51.560> you<00:01:52.520> know

00:01:52.600 --> 00:01:52.610 
be his biggest advantage and you know

00:01:52.610 --> 00:01:55.420 
be his biggest advantage and you know
whether<00:01:53.240> you<00:01:53.390> thought<00:01:53.860> Hopkins<00:01:54.860> was<00:01:55.010> faking

00:01:55.420 --> 00:01:55.430 
whether you thought Hopkins was faking

00:01:55.430 --> 00:01:56.920 
whether you thought Hopkins was faking
to<00:01:55.550> get<00:01:55.670> out<00:01:55.790> of<00:01:55.820> the<00:01:56.000> last<00:01:56.180> fight<00:01:56.540> or<00:01:56.780> whether

00:01:56.920 --> 00:01:56.930 
to get out of the last fight or whether
