and<00:00:28.189> most<00:00:29.189> commonly<00:00:29.730> known<00:00:29.910> as<00:00:30.119> to<00:00:30.390> annoy<00:00:32.870> okay

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:34.010 
and most commonly known as to annoy okay

00:00:34.010 --> 00:00:36.799 
and most commonly known as to annoy okay
now<00:00:35.010> which<00:00:35.729> one<00:00:35.760> hours<00:00:36.180> it<00:00:36.360> would<00:00:36.420> start<00:00:36.690> off

00:00:36.799 --> 00:00:36.809 
now which one hours it would start off

00:00:36.809 --> 00:00:39.590 
now which one hours it would start off
with<00:00:37.019> one<00:00:37.290> club<00:00:37.589> now<00:00:38.159> what<00:00:39.000> you're<00:00:39.120> gonna<00:00:39.269> do

00:00:39.590 --> 00:00:39.600 
with one club now what you're gonna do

00:00:39.600 --> 00:00:42.079 
with one club now what you're gonna do
is<00:00:39.750> do<00:00:39.900> a<00:00:39.930> double<00:00:40.320> revolution<00:00:41.010> okay<00:00:41.400> and<00:00:41.729> if

00:00:42.079 --> 00:00:42.089 
is do a double revolution okay and if

00:00:42.089 --> 00:00:44.360 
is do a double revolution okay and if
you<00:00:42.299> know<00:00:42.390> the<00:00:42.570> three<00:00:42.839> club<00:00:43.110> cascade<00:00:43.739> with

00:00:44.360 --> 00:00:44.370 
you know the three club cascade with

00:00:44.370 --> 00:00:47.119 
you know the three club cascade with
doubles<00:00:44.940> that<00:00:45.750> would<00:00:45.989> kind<00:00:46.320> of<00:00:46.379> help<00:00:46.620> so<00:00:47.070> if

00:00:47.119 --> 00:00:47.129 
doubles that would kind of help so if

00:00:47.129 --> 00:00:49.189 
doubles that would kind of help so if
you<00:00:47.309> don't<00:00:47.489> know<00:00:47.670> that<00:00:47.909> you<00:00:48.540> may<00:00:48.780> want<00:00:49.049> to<00:00:49.110> go

00:00:49.189 --> 00:00:49.199 
you don't know that you may want to go

00:00:49.199 --> 00:00:51.729 
you don't know that you may want to go
back<00:00:49.409> and<00:00:49.739> try<00:00:50.040> and<00:00:50.100> be<00:00:50.280> over<00:00:50.549> double<00:00:51.120> the

00:00:51.729 --> 00:00:51.739 
back and try and be over double the

00:00:51.739 --> 00:00:56.780 
back and try and be over double the
Cascade<00:00:54.170> one<00:00:55.170> club<00:00:55.500> in<00:00:55.530> it<00:00:55.830> it's<00:00:56.280> good<00:00:56.549> to<00:00:56.580> be<00:00:56.699> a

00:00:56.780 --> 00:00:56.790 
Cascade one club in it it's good to be a

00:00:56.790 --> 00:00:59.509 
Cascade one club in it it's good to be a
double<00:00:57.030> it's<00:00:57.479> a<00:00:57.869> much<00:00:58.530> tougher<00:00:58.949> if<00:00:59.460> you're

00:00:59.509 --> 00:00:59.519 
double it's a much tougher if you're

00:00:59.519 --> 00:01:02.210 
double it's a much tougher if you're
trying<00:00:59.909> to<00:01:00.059> do<00:01:00.239> single<00:01:00.960> revolutions<00:01:01.589> so<00:01:02.190> I

00:01:02.210 --> 00:01:02.220 
trying to do single revolutions so I

00:01:02.220 --> 00:01:04.460 
trying to do single revolutions so I
highly<00:01:02.640> recommend<00:01:03.030> being<00:01:03.510> able<00:01:03.809> to<00:01:03.869> do<00:01:04.049> w

00:01:04.460 --> 00:01:04.470 
highly recommend being able to do w

00:01:04.470 --> 00:01:08.480 
highly recommend being able to do w
revolutions<00:01:05.129> or<00:01:05.309> hat<00:01:06.380> this<00:01:07.380> is<00:01:07.500> the<00:01:07.619> basic<00:01:07.890> one

00:01:08.480 --> 00:01:08.490 
revolutions or hat this is the basic one

00:01:08.490 --> 00:01:10.670 
revolutions or hat this is the basic one
where<00:01:08.820> i<00:01:08.880> showed<00:01:09.210> you<00:01:09.240> not<00:01:09.659> to<00:01:09.960> one<00:01:10.350> but<00:01:10.560> the

00:01:10.670 --> 00:01:10.680 
where i showed you not to one but the

00:01:10.680 --> 00:01:12.410 
where i showed you not to one but the
other<00:01:10.710> one<00:01:11.070> first<00:01:11.399> one<00:01:11.609> that<00:01:11.759> i<00:01:11.880> demonstrated

00:01:12.410 --> 00:01:12.420 
other one first one that i demonstrated

00:01:12.420 --> 00:01:17.240 
other one first one that i demonstrated
where<00:01:13.020> it's<00:01:13.430> three<00:01:14.430> different<00:01:15.030> sections<00:01:16.250> for

00:01:17.240 --> 00:01:17.250 
where it's three different sections for

00:01:17.250 --> 00:01:26.120 
where it's three different sections for
each<00:01:17.280> below<00:01:17.729> ok<00:01:21.530> basically<00:01:24.710> just<00:01:25.710> be<00:01:25.859> able<00:01:25.979> to

00:01:26.120 --> 00:01:26.130 
each below ok basically just be able to

00:01:26.130 --> 00:01:30.410 
each below ok basically just be able to
do<00:01:26.250> this<00:01:28.159> very<00:01:29.159> simple<00:01:29.549> it's<00:01:30.210> through<00:01:30.390> a

00:01:30.410 --> 00:01:30.420 
do this very simple it's through a

00:01:30.420 --> 00:01:32.209 
do this very simple it's through a
double<00:01:30.750> revolution<00:01:31.350> and<00:01:31.530> don't<00:01:31.799> have<00:01:32.070> it

00:01:32.209 --> 00:01:32.219 
double revolution and don't have it

00:01:32.219 --> 00:01:35.599 
double revolution and don't have it
cross<00:01:32.520> it's<00:01:33.299> no<00:01:33.659> sense<00:01:34.049> rock<00:01:34.380> notation<00:01:35.219> it

00:01:35.599 --> 00:01:35.609 
cross it's no sense rock notation it

00:01:35.609 --> 00:01:38.719 
cross it's no sense rock notation it
would<00:01:35.880> be<00:01:35.999> that<00:01:36.149> thick<00:01:36.539> a<00:01:36.719> four<00:01:37.350> because<00:01:37.829> it's

00:01:38.719 --> 00:01:38.729 
would be that thick a four because it's

00:01:38.729 --> 00:01:40.550 
would be that thick a four because it's
a<00:01:38.939> double<00:01:39.390> revolution<00:01:39.960> but<00:01:40.079> staying<00:01:40.350> on<00:01:40.469> the

00:01:40.550 --> 00:01:40.560 
a double revolution but staying on the

00:01:40.560 --> 00:01:42.709 
a double revolution but staying on the
same<00:01:40.740> side<00:01:40.920> your<00:01:41.070> bike<00:01:41.219> so<00:01:41.429> i<00:01:41.460> think<00:01:41.579> it's<00:01:41.759> a<00:01:41.850> /x

00:01:42.709 --> 00:01:42.719 
same side your bike so i think it's a /x

00:01:42.719 --> 00:01:45.859 
same side your bike so i think it's a /x
wat<00:01:42.960> rotation<00:01:43.619> but<00:01:44.219> if<00:01:44.490> you<00:01:44.640> can<00:01:44.789> do<00:01:44.909> that<00:01:44.939> with

00:01:45.859 --> 00:01:45.869 
wat rotation but if you can do that with

00:01:45.869 --> 00:01:48.830 
wat rotation but if you can do that with
both<00:01:46.499> hands<00:01:46.850> you'll<00:01:47.850> be<00:01:47.969> set<00:01:48.210> yo<00:01:48.420> through<00:01:48.689> the

00:01:48.830 --> 00:01:48.840 
both hands you'll be set yo through the

00:01:48.840 --> 00:01:52.819 
both hands you'll be set yo through the
first<00:01:49.140> variation<00:01:50.009> of<00:01:50.429> columns<00:01:50.880> I<00:01:51.619> got<00:01:52.619> now

00:01:52.819 --> 00:01:52.829 
first variation of columns I got now

00:01:52.829 --> 00:01:54.440 
first variation of columns I got now
it's<00:01:52.979> time<00:01:53.130> to<00:01:53.219> move<00:01:53.340> on<00:01:53.520> the<00:01:53.700> to<00:01:53.880> close<00:01:54.179> so

00:01:54.440 --> 00:01:54.450 
it's time to move on the to close so

00:01:54.450 --> 00:01:56.959 
it's time to move on the to close so
once<00:01:54.659> you<00:01:54.840> have<00:01:55.079> the<00:01:55.409> siteswap<00:01:55.920> notation<00:01:56.640> for

00:01:56.959 --> 00:01:56.969 
once you have the siteswap notation for

00:01:56.969 --> 00:01:59.270 
once you have the siteswap notation for
or<00:01:57.719> if<00:01:58.170> you<00:01:58.319> all<00:01:58.380> know<00:01:58.590> that<00:01:58.619> the<00:01:59.009> double

00:01:59.270 --> 00:01:59.280 
or if you all know that the double

00:01:59.280 --> 00:02:02.600 
or if you all know that the double
revolution<00:01:59.880> on<00:02:00.210> each<00:02:00.689> side<00:02:01.219> you're

00:02:02.600 --> 00:02:02.610 
revolution on each side you're

00:02:02.610 --> 00:02:08.359 
revolution on each side you're
yeah<00:02:02.790> I<00:02:03.000> got<00:02:03.300> in<00:02:05.450> now<00:02:06.920> synchronize<00:02:07.920> you're

00:02:08.359 --> 00:02:08.369 
yeah I got in now synchronize you're

00:02:08.369 --> 00:02:12.530 
yeah I got in now synchronize you're
going<00:02:08.520> to<00:02:08.580> let<00:02:08.700> throw<00:02:09.119> each<00:02:10.280> Club<00:02:11.280> at<00:02:11.850> the<00:02:12.210> same

00:02:12.530 --> 00:02:12.540 
going to let throw each Club at the same

00:02:12.540 --> 00:02:17.300 
going to let throw each Club at the same
time<00:02:13.820> straight<00:02:14.820> up<00:02:14.850> and<00:02:15.590> come<00:02:16.590> out<00:02:16.770> and<00:02:17.100> it's

00:02:17.300 --> 00:02:17.310 
time straight up and come out and it's

time straight up and come out and it's
going<00:02:17.460> to<00:02:17.550> be<00:02:17.670> on<00:02:17.790> each<00:02:18.090> side<00:02:18.450> of<00:02:18.480> your<00:02:18.660> body

00:02:18.830 --> 00:02:18.840 
going to be on each side of your body

00:02:18.840 --> 00:02:20.840 
going to be on each side of your body
struggling<00:02:19.530> so<00:02:20.130> it's<00:02:20.280> got<00:02:20.430> the<00:02:20.580> asite

00:02:20.840 --> 00:02:20.850 
struggling so it's got the asite

00:02:20.850 --> 00:02:28.250 
struggling so it's got the asite
augmentation<00:02:21.420> four<00:02:22.020> on<00:02:22.980> each<00:02:23.430> side<00:02:27.260> now

00:02:28.250 --> 00:02:28.260 
augmentation four on each side now

00:02:28.260 --> 00:02:30.590 
augmentation four on each side now
that's<00:02:29.130> a<00:02:29.250> little<00:02:29.550> piece<00:02:29.790> of<00:02:30.000> two<00:02:30.209> and<00:02:30.420> one

00:02:30.590 --> 00:02:30.600 
that's a little piece of two and one

00:02:30.600 --> 00:02:32.060 
that's a little piece of two and one
even<00:02:30.990> though<00:02:31.080> we're<00:02:31.260> still<00:02:31.440> talking<00:02:31.620> about

00:02:32.060 --> 00:02:32.070 
even though we're still talking about

00:02:32.070 --> 00:02:35.360 
even though we're still talking about
the<00:02:32.310> normal<00:02:33.180> columns<00:02:33.690> up<00:02:33.990> but<00:02:34.530> that's<00:02:34.890> just<00:02:35.190> I

00:02:35.360 --> 00:02:35.370 
the normal columns up but that's just I

00:02:35.370 --> 00:02:36.740 
the normal columns up but that's just I
thought<00:02:35.550> I<00:02:35.610> would<00:02:35.850> go<00:02:35.940> ahead<00:02:36.120> and<00:02:36.330> say<00:02:36.510> that

00:02:36.740 --> 00:02:36.750 
thought I would go ahead and say that

00:02:36.750 --> 00:02:38.690 
thought I would go ahead and say that
because<00:02:37.260> we're<00:02:37.740> already<00:02:37.830> basically<00:02:38.160> i'll<00:02:38.520> let

00:02:38.690 --> 00:02:38.700 
because we're already basically i'll let

00:02:38.700 --> 00:02:42.080 
because we're already basically i'll let
you<00:02:38.850> close<00:02:39.060> up<00:02:39.330> there<00:02:39.540> so<00:02:40.250> it's<00:02:41.250> basically<00:02:41.459> do

00:02:42.080 --> 00:02:42.090 
you close up there so it's basically do

00:02:42.090 --> 00:02:46.880 
you close up there so it's basically do
this<00:02:42.980> and<00:02:43.980> then<00:02:44.130> once<00:02:44.430> they're<00:02:45.770> kind<00:02:46.770> of

00:02:46.880 --> 00:02:46.890 
this and then once they're kind of

00:02:46.890 --> 00:02:50.150 
this and then once they're kind of
Midway<00:02:47.580> coming<00:02:48.120> down<00:02:48.360> for<00:02:49.080> the<00:02:49.170> two<00:02:49.800> and<00:02:49.980> one

00:02:50.150 --> 00:02:50.160 
Midway coming down for the two and one

00:02:50.160 --> 00:02:54.280 
Midway coming down for the two and one
you<00:02:50.370> grow<00:02:50.820> obviously<00:02:51.660> the<00:02:52.230> straight<00:02:52.739> club<00:02:52.980> up

00:02:54.280 --> 00:02:54.290 
you grow obviously the straight club up

00:02:54.290 --> 00:03:01.210 
you grow obviously the straight club up
alright<00:02:55.290> but<00:02:56.280> um<00:02:56.489> now<00:02:57.120> move<00:02:57.480> on<00:02:57.690> to<00:02:57.720> the<00:02:58.260> actual

00:03:01.210 --> 00:03:01.220 
alright but um now move on to the actual

00:03:01.220 --> 00:03:03.110 
alright but um now move on to the actual
columns<00:03:02.220> that<00:03:02.370> we<00:03:02.520> were<00:03:02.610> talking<00:03:03.000> about

00:03:03.110 --> 00:03:03.120 
columns that we were talking about

00:03:03.120 --> 00:03:07.190 
columns that we were talking about
riginal<00:03:04.820> now<00:03:05.820> two<00:03:06.239> clubs<00:03:06.570> which<00:03:06.930> we're<00:03:07.080> going

00:03:07.190 --> 00:03:07.200 
riginal now two clubs which we're going

00:03:07.200 --> 00:03:11.560 
riginal now two clubs which we're going
to<00:03:07.350> be<00:03:07.440> able<00:03:07.650> to<00:03:07.709> see<00:03:08.280> original<00:03:08.700> pattern<00:03:09.290> looks

00:03:11.560 --> 00:03:11.570 
to be able to see original pattern looks

00:03:11.570 --> 00:03:15.729 
to be able to see original pattern looks
you're<00:03:12.570> going<00:03:12.750> to<00:03:12.840> have<00:03:12.959> big<00:03:13.350> wolf<00:03:13.709> doubles

00:03:15.729 --> 00:03:15.739 
you're going to have big wolf doubles

00:03:15.739 --> 00:03:18.380 
you're going to have big wolf doubles
the<00:03:16.739> breaking<00:03:17.220> in<00:03:17.400> between<00:03:17.910> them<00:03:18.030> for<00:03:18.239> your

00:03:18.380 --> 00:03:18.390 
the breaking in between them for your

00:03:18.390 --> 00:03:20.900 
the breaking in between them for your
hand<00:03:18.570> third<00:03:18.930> club<00:03:19.230> enhance<00:03:19.920> now<00:03:20.340> how<00:03:20.610> do<00:03:20.670> we<00:03:20.760> go

00:03:20.900 --> 00:03:20.910 
hand third club enhance now how do we go

00:03:20.910 --> 00:03:23.570 
hand third club enhance now how do we go
about<00:03:20.940> to<00:03:21.360> simulate<00:03:21.769> the<00:03:22.769> basic<00:03:23.100> food<00:03:23.310> which

00:03:23.570 --> 00:03:23.580 
about to simulate the basic food which

00:03:23.580 --> 00:03:29.440 
about to simulate the basic food which
is<00:03:23.610> this<00:03:26.330> that's<00:03:27.330> it<00:03:27.540> you<00:03:28.080> throw<00:03:28.560> the<00:03:28.769> blue

00:03:29.440 --> 00:03:29.450 
is this that's it you throw the blue

00:03:29.450 --> 00:03:33.110 
is this that's it you throw the blue
throw<00:03:30.450> the<00:03:30.660> red<00:03:30.840> catch<00:03:31.769> the<00:03:32.100> blue<00:03:32.340> and<00:03:32.640> cash

00:03:33.110 --> 00:03:33.120 
throw the red catch the blue and cash

00:03:33.120 --> 00:03:42.670 
throw the red catch the blue and cash
read<00:03:33.570> that<00:03:34.110> simple<00:03:34.440> okay<00:03:36.470> that's<00:03:37.470> it

00:03:42.670 --> 00:03:42.680 

00:03:42.680 --> 00:03:45.759 

okay<00:03:43.310> this<00:03:44.239> is<00:03:44.359> for<00:03:44.599> the<00:03:44.629> original<00:03:45.230> pattern<00:03:45.620> or

00:03:45.759 --> 00:03:45.769 
okay this is for the original pattern or

00:03:45.769 --> 00:03:50.440 
okay this is for the original pattern or
your<00:03:46.040> milk<00:03:46.510> ok<00:03:48.189> but<00:03:49.189> just<00:03:49.489> very<00:03:49.909> simple<00:03:50.329> all

00:03:50.440 --> 00:03:50.450 
your milk ok but just very simple all

00:03:50.450 --> 00:03:52.179 
your milk ok but just very simple all
you<00:03:50.510> don't<00:03:51.170> take<00:03:51.319> you<00:03:51.500> maybe<00:03:51.650> a<00:03:51.829> couple<00:03:52.040> of

00:03:52.179 --> 00:03:52.189 
you don't take you maybe a couple of

00:03:52.189 --> 00:03:54.250 
you don't take you maybe a couple of
hours<00:03:52.489> of<00:03:52.609> practice<00:03:53.030> yeah<00:03:53.629> we<00:03:53.780> get<00:03:53.959> the<00:03:54.079> true

00:03:54.250 --> 00:03:54.260 
hours of practice yeah we get the true

00:03:54.260 --> 00:04:03.099 
hours of practice yeah we get the true
flow<00:03:54.530> pattern<00:03:54.980> now<00:03:59.620> okay<00:04:00.620> and<00:04:01.780> obviously<00:04:02.780> like

00:04:03.099 --> 00:04:03.109 
flow pattern now okay and obviously like

00:04:03.109 --> 00:04:05.649 
flow pattern now okay and obviously like
I<00:04:03.230> said<00:04:03.439> the<00:04:03.560> two<00:04:03.769> unless<00:04:04.180> recognized<00:04:05.180> it's<00:04:05.629> a

00:04:05.649 --> 00:04:05.659 
I said the two unless recognized it's a

00:04:05.659 --> 00:04:07.330 
I said the two unless recognized it's a
little<00:04:05.750> bit<00:04:05.870> easier<00:04:06.049> that<00:04:06.439> way<00:04:06.469> in<00:04:06.799> that

00:04:07.330 --> 00:04:07.340 
little bit easier that way in that

00:04:07.340 --> 00:04:12.610 
little bit easier that way in that
pattern<00:04:07.609> but<00:04:08.590> you'll<00:04:09.590> be<00:04:09.620> doing<00:04:11.139> ok<00:04:12.139> the<00:04:12.590> next

00:04:12.610 --> 00:04:12.620 
pattern but you'll be doing ok the next

00:04:12.620 --> 00:04:14.170 
pattern but you'll be doing ok the next
particular<00:04:13.310> patterns<00:04:13.700> once<00:04:13.939> you're<00:04:14.090> good

00:04:14.170 --> 00:04:14.180 
particular patterns once you're good

00:04:14.180 --> 00:04:16.810 
particular patterns once you're good
with<00:04:14.329> that<00:04:14.359> both<00:04:14.810> hands<00:04:15.220> do<00:04:16.220> do<00:04:16.549> that<00:04:16.579> a<00:04:16.759> couple

00:04:16.810 --> 00:04:16.820 
with that both hands do do that a couple

00:04:16.820 --> 00:04:18.939 
with that both hands do do that a couple
throws<00:04:17.359> and<00:04:17.570> build<00:04:17.810> up<00:04:17.930> your<00:04:17.989> courage<00:04:18.349> that<00:04:18.680> I

00:04:18.939 --> 00:04:18.949 
throws and build up your courage that I

00:04:18.949 --> 00:04:20.800 
throws and build up your courage that I
show<00:04:19.280> you<00:04:19.340> the<00:04:19.459> frequent<00:04:19.910> a<00:04:20.030> turn<00:04:20.180> of<00:04:20.299> that<00:04:20.479> and

00:04:20.800 --> 00:04:20.810 
show you the frequent a turn of that and

00:04:20.810 --> 00:04:24.270 
show you the frequent a turn of that and
how<00:04:21.349> to<00:04:21.410> perform<00:04:21.979> ok<00:04:22.479> now<00:04:23.479> once<00:04:23.750> you<00:04:23.870> have<00:04:24.020> the

00:04:24.270 --> 00:04:24.280 
how to perform ok now once you have the

00:04:24.280 --> 00:04:27.850 
how to perform ok now once you have the
to<00:04:25.280> behold<00:04:25.610> pattern<00:04:26.120> into<00:04:26.630> tan<00:04:26.930> done<00:04:27.410> pretty

00:04:27.850 --> 00:04:27.860 
to behold pattern into tan done pretty

00:04:27.860 --> 00:04:30.909 
to behold pattern into tan done pretty
well<00:04:27.949> you<00:04:28.789> should<00:04:29.000> be<00:04:29.090> able<00:04:29.259> going<00:04:30.259> prickly

00:04:30.909 --> 00:04:30.919 
well you should be able going prickly

00:04:30.919 --> 00:04:33.189 
well you should be able going prickly
pattern<00:04:31.130> which<00:04:31.820> what<00:04:32.389> you're<00:04:32.539> going<00:04:32.660> to<00:04:32.900> do<00:04:33.020> is

00:04:33.189 --> 00:04:33.199 
pattern which what you're going to do is

00:04:33.199 --> 00:04:36.279 
pattern which what you're going to do is
throw<00:04:33.500> a<00:04:33.860> club<00:04:34.580> from<00:04:35.030> your<00:04:35.270> gun<00:04:35.570> hand<00:04:35.599> up<00:04:36.259> to

00:04:36.279 --> 00:04:36.289 
throw a club from your gun hand up to

00:04:36.289 --> 00:04:40.210 
throw a club from your gun hand up to
the<00:04:36.560> center<00:04:38.139> ok<00:04:39.139> you<00:04:39.560> want<00:04:39.740> it<00:04:39.800> pretty<00:04:40.009> well

00:04:40.210 --> 00:04:40.220 
the center ok you want it pretty well

00:04:40.220 --> 00:04:42.100 
the center ok you want it pretty well
aligned<00:04:40.669> with<00:04:41.120> the<00:04:41.240> center<00:04:41.539> because<00:04:41.690> I'm<00:04:41.990> just

00:04:42.100 --> 00:04:42.110 
aligned with the center because I'm just

00:04:42.110 --> 00:04:43.680 
aligned with the center because I'm just
gonna<00:04:42.199> have<00:04:42.410> to<00:04:42.530> stay<00:04:42.770> there<00:04:42.800> pretty<00:04:43.370> much

00:04:43.680 --> 00:04:43.690 
gonna have to stay there pretty much

00:04:43.690 --> 00:04:46.510 
gonna have to stay there pretty much
columns<00:04:44.690> and<00:04:44.870> I<00:04:45.590> would<00:04:45.860> suggest<00:04:45.979> a<00:04:46.280> wide

00:04:46.510 --> 00:04:46.520 
columns and I would suggest a wide

00:04:46.520 --> 00:04:48.760 
columns and I would suggest a wide
cascade<00:04:47.180> pattern<00:04:47.389> or<00:04:47.870> wider<00:04:48.199> because<00:04:48.500> it

00:04:48.760 --> 00:04:48.770 
cascade pattern or wider because it

00:04:48.770 --> 00:04:51.159 
cascade pattern or wider because it
looks<00:04:48.949> kind<00:04:49.310> of<00:04:49.400> more<00:04:49.610> I'll<00:04:50.270> just<00:04:50.539> plain<00:04:50.990> old

00:04:51.159 --> 00:04:51.169

on and maybe two or three more throws
and<00:05:17.360> just<00:05:17.599> build<00:05:17.840> up<00:05:18.050> from<00:05:18.259> there<00:05:18.349> it's<00:05:18.680> quite

00:05:19.270 --> 00:05:19.280 
and just build up from there it's quite

gonna do throw one up in the center with

00:05:26.930 --> 00:05:29.920 
gonna do throw one up in the center with
your<00:05:27.080> dominant<00:05:27.229> hand<00:05:27.610> double<00:05:28.610> revolution<00:05:29.210> ok

00:05:29.920 --> 00:05:29.930 
your dominant hand double revolution ok

00:05:29.930 --> 00:05:32.290 
your dominant hand double revolution ok
now<00:05:30.380> with<00:05:30.590> the<00:05:30.680> upper<00:05:30.889> to<00:05:31.099> throw<00:05:31.789> outside

which<00:05:32.630> is<00:05:32.780> a<00:05:32.810> site<00:05:33.139> swap<00:05:33.409> for<00:05:33.740> in<00:05:33.889> both<00:05:34.159> hands

00:05:34.450 --> 00:05:34.460 
which is a site swap for in both hands

00:05:34.460 --> 00:05:40.810 
which is a site swap for in both hands
at<00:05:34.849> the<00:05:34.880> same<00:05:34.970> time<00:05:35.449> ok<00:05:36.009> sounds<00:05:37.009> complicated

girl it so many times you can't drop
until<00:05:47.780> the<00:05:48.020> droppings<00:05:48.410> basically<00:05:48.830> just<00:05:48.980> a<00:05:49.160> few

00:05:49.480 --> 00:05:49.490 
until the droppings basically just a few

00:05:49.490 --> 00:05:54.070 
until the droppings basically just a few
lines<00:05:49.730> with<00:05:50.000> this<00:05:50.180> trip<00:05:50.480> and<00:05:50.750> then<00:05:53.080> couple

00:05:54.070 --> 00:05:54.080 
lines with this trip and then couple

00:05:54.080 --> 00:06:03.220 
lines with this trip and then couple
