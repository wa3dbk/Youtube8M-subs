00:00:16.340 --> 00:00:16.350 
I'm going to teach your recipe that's a

00:00:16.350 --> 00:00:20.300 
I'm going to teach your recipe that's a
version<00:00:16.980> of<00:00:17.100> my<00:00:17.279> mother's<00:00:17.609> chowder<00:00:19.310> so

00:00:20.300 --> 00:00:20.310 
version of my mother's chowder so

00:00:20.310 --> 00:00:24.140 
version of my mother's chowder so
growing<00:00:21.240> up<00:00:21.449> my<00:00:21.630> mom<00:00:21.840> always<00:00:21.949> froze<00:00:22.949> our<00:00:23.550> bacon

00:00:24.140 --> 00:00:24.150 
growing up my mom always froze our bacon

00:00:24.150 --> 00:00:26.000 
growing up my mom always froze our bacon
and<00:00:24.359> I<00:00:24.539> will<00:00:24.930> confess<00:00:25.140> I<00:00:25.439> think<00:00:25.619> it's<00:00:25.769> a<00:00:25.859> whole

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:26.010 
and I will confess I think it's a whole

00:00:26.010 --> 00:00:27.470 
and I will confess I think it's a whole
lot<00:00:26.189> easier<00:00:26.220> to<00:00:26.699> do<00:00:26.789> it<00:00:26.939> that<00:00:26.970> way

00:00:27.470 --> 00:00:27.480 
lot easier to do it that way

00:00:27.480 --> 00:00:30.679 
lot easier to do it that way
so<00:00:27.930> if<00:00:28.140> you<00:00:28.349> have<00:00:29.039> frozen<00:00:29.369> bacon<00:00:30.090> pull<00:00:30.480> it<00:00:30.570> out

00:00:30.679 --> 00:00:30.689 
so if you have frozen bacon pull it out

00:00:30.689 --> 00:00:36.830 
so if you have frozen bacon pull it out
and<00:00:31.579> cut<00:00:32.579> it<00:00:32.610> frozen<00:00:33.800> this<00:00:35.450> quarter<00:00:36.450> pound<00:00:36.690> of

00:02:12.750 --> 00:02:12.760 
down in the soup and that might be more

little<00:03:11.690> unusual<00:03:12.140> but<00:03:12.650> really<00:03:13.720> it<00:03:14.720> makes<00:03:15.230> all

00:03:15.520 --> 00:03:15.530 
little unusual but really it makes all

00:03:15.530 --> 00:03:17.199 
little unusual but really it makes all
the<00:03:15.560> difference<00:03:15.739> in<00:03:16.159> the<00:03:16.250> world<00:03:16.430> it's<00:03:16.760> you

00:03:17.199 --> 00:03:17.209 
the difference in the world it's you

00:03:17.209 --> 00:03:18.880 
the difference in the world it's you
could<00:03:17.360> also<00:03:17.480> use<00:03:17.720> a<00:03:17.750> white<00:03:18.140> wine<00:03:18.319> or<00:03:18.349> you<00:03:18.739> could

00:03:18.880 --> 00:03:18.890 
could also use a white wine or you could

00:03:18.890 --> 00:03:21.309 
could also use a white wine or you could
even<00:03:18.980> use<00:03:19.159> sherry<00:03:19.519> but<00:03:19.879> the<00:03:20.060> acid<00:03:20.690> in<00:03:21.140> the

00:03:21.309 --> 00:03:21.319 
even use sherry but the acid in the

00:03:21.319 --> 00:03:24.970 
even use sherry but the acid in the
vinegar<00:03:22.120> helps<00:03:23.120> to<00:03:23.650> create<00:03:24.650> a<00:03:24.709> more<00:03:24.950> complex

00:03:24.970 --> 00:03:24.980 
vinegar helps to create a more complex

00:03:24.980 --> 00:03:27.940 
vinegar helps to create a more complex
and<00:03:25.790> interesting<00:03:26.359> flavored<00:03:26.959> soup<00:03:27.260> I'm<00:03:27.890> going

free to use milk if you prefer if you
want<00:04:29.430> to<00:04:29.550> leave<00:04:29.729> it<00:04:29.880> out<00:04:29.970> entirely<00:04:30.479> another

00:04:31.010 --> 00:04:31.020 
want to leave it out entirely another

00:04:31.020 --> 00:04:32.330

thing<00:04:31.289> that<00:04:31.410> you<00:04:31.500> might<00:04:31.620> be<00:04:31.770> able<00:04:31.830> to<00:04:31.949> do<00:04:32.160> is

00:04:32.330 --> 00:04:32.340 
thing that you might be able to do is

00:04:32.340 --> 00:04:34.270 
thing that you might be able to do is
use<00:04:32.610> a<00:04:32.639> can<00:04:33.030> of<00:04:33.060> creamed<00:04:33.660> corn

00:04:37.100 --> 00:04:37.110 
instead of some of the whole corn it

00:04:37.110 --> 00:04:39.080 
instead of some of the whole corn it
adds<00:04:37.320> a<00:04:37.470> nice<00:04:37.590> creamy<00:04:38.039> texture<00:04:38.550> to<00:04:38.639> the<00:04:38.880> soup

00:04:39.080 --> 00:04:39.090

00:04:44.160 --> 00:04:47.200 
I'm going to start with a couple of
tablespoons<00:04:44.430> of<00:04:45.030> salt<00:04:45.300> you<00:04:45.630> can<00:04:46.500> reduce<00:04:46.860> that
