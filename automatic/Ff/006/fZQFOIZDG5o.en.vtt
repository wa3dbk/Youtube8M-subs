00:00:50.189 --> 00:00:50.199 
that we did get so and what precision is

00:00:50.199 --> 00:00:51.840 
that we did get so and what precision is
definitely<00:00:50.680> key<00:00:50.920> in<00:00:51.010> our<00:00:51.100> performance<00:00:51.730> I<00:00:51.820> mean

00:00:55.530 --> 00:00:55.540 
one of the things that we really try to

00:00:55.540 --> 00:00:57.959 
one of the things that we really try to
focus<00:00:55.750> on<00:00:56.049> is<00:00:56.260> executing<00:00:57.070> our<00:00:57.159> steps<00:00:57.399> well<00:00:57.610> and

focus on is executing our steps well and

00:00:57.969 --> 00:01:02.560 
focus on is executing our steps well and
we<00:00:58.239> think<00:00:58.690> that<00:00:58.960> we<00:00:59.049> did<00:00:59.170> that<00:00:59.290> today
