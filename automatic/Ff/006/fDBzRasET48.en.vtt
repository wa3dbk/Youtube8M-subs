I<00:03:03.099> the<00:03:03.610> sick

00:03:10.150 --> 00:03:10.160 

00:03:10.160 --> 00:03:13.900 

I<00:03:10.330> make<00:03:11.330> sure<00:03:11.510> you<00:03:11.630> always<00:03:11.870> have<00:03:12.200> one<00:03:12.500> free<00:03:13.010> and

his<00:03:14.150> horror<00:03:14.360> spot<00:03:14.720> for<00:03:14.960> your<00:03:15.080> fire<00:03:15.320> cape<00:03:15.740> if

00:03:15.910 --> 00:03:15.920 
his horror spot for your fire cape if

00:03:15.920 --> 00:03:17.440 
his horror spot for your fire cape if
you'd

00:03:17.440 --> 00:03:17.450 
you'd

00:03:17.450 --> 00:03:22.460 
you'd
she<00:03:18.170> doesn't<00:03:18.560> drop<00:03:18.800> items<00:03:19.280> on<00:03:19.730> the<00:03:19.849> ground<00:03:20.150> so

00:03:22.460 --> 00:03:22.470 
she doesn't drop items on the ground so

00:03:22.470 --> 00:03:25.280 
she doesn't drop items on the ground so
they<00:03:23.040> go<00:03:23.220> in<00:03:23.340> inventory<00:03:23.940> and<00:03:24.360> if<00:03:24.810> it's<00:03:24.960> full

00:03:25.280 --> 00:03:25.290 
they go in inventory and if it's full

00:03:25.290 --> 00:03:28.860 
they go in inventory and if it's full
you<00:03:25.800> won't<00:03:25.980> get<00:03:26.190> it

00:03:28.860 --> 00:03:28.870 

00:03:28.870 --> 00:03:32.039 

the<00:03:29.799> summon<00:03:30.250> helps<00:03:30.549> a<00:03:30.640> lot<00:03:30.819> because<00:03:31.000> you<00:03:31.870> can

00:03:32.039 --> 00:03:32.049 
the summon helps a lot because you can

00:03:32.049 --> 00:03:38.830 
the summon helps a lot because you can
head<00:03:32.200> out<00:03:32.230> to<00:03:32.590> a<00:03:33.060> 257<00:03:34.060> as<00:03:34.269> you<00:03:35.230> just<00:03:35.260> saw

00:03:38.830 --> 00:03:38.840 

00:03:38.840 --> 00:03:47.220 

so<00:03:39.500> i<00:03:39.980> highly<00:03:40.700> recommend<00:03:41.420> it

00:03:47.220 --> 00:03:47.230 

00:03:47.230 --> 00:03:51.370 

hundred<00:03:47.890> and<00:03:48.010> eleven<00:03:48.099> with<00:03:48.760> it

00:03:51.370 --> 00:03:51.380 

00:03:51.380 --> 00:03:56.600 

but<00:03:51.920> no<00:03:52.160> prayer

00:03:56.600 --> 00:03:56.610 

00:03:56.610 --> 00:04:16.770 

no<00:03:56.970> not<00:03:57.270> that

00:04:16.770 --> 00:04:16.780 

00:04:16.780 --> 00:04:28.330 

just<00:04:17.320> kill<00:04:17.709> it

00:04:28.330 --> 00:04:28.340 

00:04:28.340 --> 00:04:30.610 

there<00:04:28.970> we<00:04:29.180> go

00:04:30.610 --> 00:04:30.620 
there we go

00:04:30.620 --> 00:04:33.700 
there we go
and<00:04:30.830> I<00:04:31.520> didn't<00:04:31.820> get<00:04:31.940> fire<00:04:32.210> cape<00:04:32.449> so

00:04:33.700 --> 00:04:33.710 
and I didn't get fire cape so

00:04:33.710 --> 00:04:36.839 
and I didn't get fire cape so
I'll<00:04:34.160> be<00:04:34.340> back<00:04:34.580> when<00:04:34.760> i<00:04:34.850> get<00:04:35.000> a<00:04:35.030> fire<00:04:35.270> cake

00:04:36.839 --> 00:04:36.849 
I'll be back when i get a fire cake

00:04:36.849 --> 00:04:40.079 
I'll be back when i get a fire cake
so<00:04:37.449> I<00:04:37.929> guess<00:04:38.139> this<00:04:38.949> little<00:04:39.309> spot<00:04:39.580> right<00:04:39.849> here

00:04:40.079 --> 00:04:40.089 
so I guess this little spot right here

00:04:40.089 --> 00:04:43.579 
so I guess this little spot right here
is<00:04:41.020> a<00:04:41.229> little<00:04:41.559> safe<00:04:42.099> spot<00:04:42.520> to<00:04:42.879> kill<00:04:43.119> this<00:04:43.270> guy

00:04:43.579 --> 00:04:43.589 
is a little safe spot to kill this guy

00:04:43.589 --> 00:04:46.799 
is a little safe spot to kill this guy
so<00:04:44.589> you<00:04:44.889> can<00:04:45.099> probably<00:04:45.309> kill<00:04:45.639> it<00:04:45.819> with<00:04:46.539> one

00:04:46.799 --> 00:04:46.809 
so you can probably kill it with one

00:04:46.809 --> 00:04:48.820 
so you can probably kill it with one
prayer

00:04:48.820 --> 00:04:48.830 
prayer

00:04:48.830 --> 00:04:53.490 
prayer

00:04:58.750 --> 00:04:58.760 

00:04:58.760 --> 00:05:01.180
