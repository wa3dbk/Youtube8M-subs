00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.799
 boxes have long become commonplace 

00:00:02.250 --> 00:00:06.210
 for modern society if there were 

00:00:04.799 --> 00:00:08.340
 times when similar methods 

00:00:06.210 --> 00:00:10.710
 expressions were condemned 

00:00:08.340 --> 00:00:12.540
 now tattooed girls and guys 

00:00:10.710 --> 00:00:15.360

00:00:15.360 --> 00:00:18.930
 parts of the body come to us disappeared ancient 

00:00:17.940 --> 00:00:21.750
 the era 

00:00:18.930 --> 00:00:24.240
 when in this way warriors stimulated 

00:00:21.750 --> 00:00:25.890
 their masculinity and not intricate 

00:00:24.240 --> 00:00:27.529
 drawings carried a certain sense 

00:00:25.890 --> 00:00:30.510
 load 

00:00:27.529 --> 00:00:34.290
 Lucky Diamond Rich was born in a new 

00:00:30.510 --> 00:00:36.300
 of zealand in 1971 then nobody 

00:00:34.290 --> 00:00:39.989
 knew that he would be known to the whole world 

00:00:36.300 --> 00:00:42.270
 8 unusual way to cover everything 

00:00:39.989 --> 00:00:44.579
 his body tattooed came to him more 

00:00:42.270 --> 00:00:47.460
 as a child, but he spent a long time in the house 

00:00:44.579 --> 00:00:50.399
 Then he made his first work 

00:00:47.460 --> 00:00:52.610
 tattooed image of a small head 

00:00:50.399 --> 00:00:55.440
 for juggling on the thigh 

00:00:52.610 --> 00:00:57.710
 this diamond wanted to emphasize his 

00:00:55.440 --> 00:01:00.510
 belonging to the circus industry 

00:00:57.710 --> 00:01:03.750
 first experience of drawing on the body before 

00:01:00.510 --> 00:01:05.640
 varnishes could hardly be too pleasant 

00:01:03.750 --> 00:01:07.320
 since this process is related to physical 

00:01:05.640 --> 00:01:09.510
 pain for enough 

00:01:07.320 --> 00:01:11.549
 long time to desire 

00:01:09.510 --> 00:01:13.860
 self-expression turned out to be stronger and 

00:01:11.549 --> 00:01:16.140
 the number of tattoos on the body gradually 

00:01:13.860 --> 00:01:19.170
 over time, relevance grew 

00:01:16.140 --> 00:01:21.900
 of some image dropped on their 

00:01:19.170 --> 00:01:24.450
 the place was applied new monochrome and 

00:01:21.900 --> 00:01:27.210
 colored probably no doubt 

00:01:24.450 --> 00:01:28.619
 that some moment tattooing reason 

00:01:27.210 --> 00:01:29.610
 for lucky is not just the way 

00:01:28.619 --> 00:01:32.490
 expressions 

00:01:29.610 --> 00:01:34.350
 gamble on his body left 

00:01:32.490 --> 00:01:36.799
 quite a bit of free space and 

00:01:34.350 --> 00:01:40.799
 fill it was a matter of principle 

00:01:36.799 --> 00:01:42.630
 as a result, in 2006 he fell into 

00:01:40.799 --> 00:01:45.119

00:01:42.630 --> 00:01:47.220
 tattooed man of the planet on that 

00:01:45.119 --> 00:01:49.320
 the moment his skin was covered with a tattoo almost 

00:01:47.220 --> 00:01:53.399
 one hundred percent key intimate places 

00:01:49.320 --> 00:01:56.250
 century and mouth if the subject of the first drawings 

00:01:53.399 --> 00:01:57.840
 thought carefully to find should not have been 

00:01:56.250 --> 00:01:59.860
 tell the world about the characteristics 

00:01:57.840 --> 00:02:02.410
 his master 

00:01:59.860 --> 00:02:04.360
 then later it was just 

00:02:02.410 --> 00:02:07.210
 desire to fill free space 

00:02:04.360 --> 00:02:09.220
 This of course some drawings bear 

00:02:07.210 --> 00:02:11.950
 semantic load and now when fate 

00:02:09.220 --> 00:02:14.500

00:02:21.610 --> 00:02:25.690
 festivals 

00:02:22.650 --> 00:02:28.180
 Rich's performance includes swallowing himself 

00:02:25.690 --> 00:02:31.060
 putter juggling with various items 

00:02:28.180 --> 00:02:32.860
 and ride on a four meter monocycle 

00:02:31.060 --> 00:02:35.680
 nomadic life leaves its mark 

00:02:32.860 --> 00:02:39.570
 not only on this person's facial features 

00:02:35.680 --> 00:02:39.570
 but also on the subject of his tattoos
