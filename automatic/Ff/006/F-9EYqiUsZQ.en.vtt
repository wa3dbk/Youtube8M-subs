00:00:06.280 --> 00:00:10.240
 and reduced size of the track 

00:00:08.050 --> 00:00:12.160
 airport la nubia airline lan 

00:00:10.240 --> 00:00:14.139
 will only operate until the next 23 of 

00:00:12.160 --> 00:00:16.270
 September in manizales the company 

00:00:14.139 --> 00:00:18.550
 he argues his retirement due to 

00:00:16.270 --> 00:00:20.670
 losses due to cancellations and diversion of 

00:00:18.550 --> 00:00:20.670
 flights 

00:00:20.860 --> 00:00:24.930
 I have done a technical evaluation 

00:00:22.210 --> 00:00:27.460
 operational and economic of our 

00:00:24.930 --> 00:00:29.820
 Performance of the routes in Bogota 

00:00:27.460 --> 00:00:32.560
 manizales bogotá armen and the decision is 

00:00:29.820 --> 00:00:34.750
 suspend the routes as of 24 of 

00:00:32.560 --> 00:00:37.570
 September and that the entire operation of 

00:00:34.750 --> 00:00:39.190
 lan colombia is done by pereyra that 

00:00:37.570 --> 00:00:40.960
 can concentrate from pereira and 

00:00:39.190 --> 00:00:42.400
 look for alternatives from this 

00:00:40.960 --> 00:00:43.930
 decision to generate connectivity 

00:00:42.400 --> 00:00:45.640
 land of the two cities with 

00:00:43.930 --> 00:00:48.100
 pereira and also look for an alternative 

00:00:45.640 --> 00:00:49.660
 to increase the offer by pereyra all 

00:00:48.100 --> 00:00:51.340
 this is going to be analyzed according to the 

00:00:49.660 --> 00:00:53.829
 demand that we have future of the two 

00:00:51.340 --> 00:00:57.040
 cities the decision is related 

00:00:53.829 --> 00:00:58.930
 with meteorological issues is a reality 

00:00:57.040 --> 00:01:00.160
 that weather conditions and 

00:00:58.930 --> 00:01:02.440
 conditions also infrastructure of 

00:01:00.160 --> 00:01:04.720
 track in manizales affect so 

00:01:02.440 --> 00:01:07.420
 important the operation the fact that 

00:01:04.720 --> 00:01:09.250
 On the runway we can only operate aircraft 

00:01:07.420 --> 00:01:11.320
 turboprop limits the possibilities of 

00:01:09.250 --> 00:01:14.440
 growth in terms of demand from the 

00:01:11.320 --> 00:01:16.479
 of destination for which we have to take 

00:01:14.440 --> 00:01:18.940
 the final decision to suspend the 

00:01:16.479 --> 00:01:19.730
 routes actually the conditions a 

00:01:18.940 --> 00:01:22.170
 structure 

00:01:19.730 --> 00:01:23.909
 and what we believe is 

00:01:22.170 --> 00:01:26.400
 the alternatives could be the 

00:01:23.909 --> 00:01:28.440
 development of 

00:01:26.400 --> 00:01:30.960
 future in the Palestinian option is a 

00:01:28.440 --> 00:01:32.670
 very interesting option and obviously it 's a 

00:01:30.960 --> 00:01:35.370
 medium term but it is the alternative that 

00:01:32.670 --> 00:01:37.710
 we could consider to be able to have 

00:01:35.370 --> 00:01:39.670
 new alternatives however today 

00:01:37.710 --> 00:01:43.500
 I'm very much in meetings with the 

00:01:39.670 --> 00:01:43.500
 of manizales and we were disco 

00:01:45.970 --> 00:01:50.980
 in the next week to see how 

00:01:48.930 --> 00:01:52.300
 modeling the difference alternatives that 

00:01:50.980 --> 00:01:54.370
 They have given us how they could be 

00:01:52.300 --> 00:01:56.280
 results and from that then take 

00:01:54.370 --> 00:01:58.330
 additions of the case however today 

00:01:56.280 --> 00:02:01.240
 independent of the meeting that we have 

00:01:58.330 --> 00:02:03.970
 next week we will continue with the 

00:02:01.240 --> 00:02:06.340
 decision of September 24 and although 

00:02:03.970 --> 00:02:07.900
 the mayor himself is expected 

00:02:06.340 --> 00:02:10.030
 governor of brothels and guilds 

00:02:07.900 --> 00:02:11.920
 representatives of lan the mayoralty of 

00:02:10.030 --> 00:02:14.110
 Manizales proposed alternatives to 

00:02:11.920 --> 00:02:16.240
 said company so that they continue operating in 

00:02:14.110 --> 00:02:19.380
 the city ​​one of the proposals is the 

00:02:16.240 --> 00:02:19.380
 change of itineraries 

00:02:21.050 --> 00:02:26.660
 of those operations the city ​​of 

00:02:24.560 --> 00:02:28.730
 Manizales on September 24 

00:02:26.660 --> 00:02:30.200
 for obvious reasons because we stayed in 

00:02:28.730 --> 00:02:31.760
 hands of a leftover from the shore because 

00:02:30.200 --> 00:02:33.920
 there is no competition they are going to raise the 

00:02:31.760 --> 00:02:35.990
 fees by ancap is that the 

00:02:33.920 --> 00:02:37.580
 logical condition of the market the 

00:02:35.990 --> 00:02:39.569
 line arguments are the following 

00:02:37.580 --> 00:02:42.930
 first that the loss route 

00:02:39.569 --> 00:02:45.090
 and second that the operability of the 

00:02:42.930 --> 00:02:47.760
 Girlfriend as she is well known of all is 

00:02:45.090 --> 00:02:49.709
 pretty bad keep closed then 

00:02:47.760 --> 00:02:51.749
 the solution we have is long 

00:02:49.709 --> 00:02:53.129
 term and that we are delayed that is the 

00:02:51.749 --> 00:02:56.010
 airport in which we have to fight 

00:02:53.129 --> 00:02:58.230
 all to get it out as soon as possible 

00:02:56.010 --> 00:02:59.849
 what proposals do the guilds have 

00:02:58.230 --> 00:03:03.739
 specifically as they have interior 

00:02:59.849 --> 00:03:06.299
 Alan the next first to delay the 

00:03:03.739 --> 00:03:08.280
 suspension of the route at least until 

00:03:06.299 --> 00:03:11.170
 January February next year while 

00:03:08.280 --> 00:03:14.590
 that we look for other lines that operate 

00:03:11.170 --> 00:03:16.599
 and the bogota manizales route by light and 

00:03:14.590 --> 00:03:18.670
 the second alternative that is in the background 

00:03:16.599 --> 00:03:21.040
 in the next one we proposed that 

00:03:18.670 --> 00:03:22.959
 study the possibility of having a 

00:03:21.040 --> 00:03:24.910
 different itinerary that is a 

00:03:22.959 --> 00:03:28.180
 different itinerary is a flight that 

00:03:24.910 --> 00:03:32.410
 make from Bogota towards manizales type 4 and 

00:03:28.180 --> 00:03:34.540
 30 4 40 in the afternoon that the plane sleeps 

00:03:32.410 --> 00:03:37.090
 in manizales and that operates the route 

00:03:34.540 --> 00:03:38.830
 manizales bogotá at 5 and 50 6 of the 

00:03:37.090 --> 00:03:42.430
 tomorrow because we chose that proposal 

00:03:38.830 --> 00:03:45.040
 first because we consider the plane 

00:03:42.430 --> 00:03:46.810
 would have almost full occupation and second 

00:03:45.040 --> 00:03:48.930
 because the weather conditions of 

00:03:46.810 --> 00:03:51.760
 the bride for decoration 

00:03:48.930 --> 00:03:54.430
 in the first hour of the day in terms 

00:03:51.760 --> 00:03:55.750
 general according to statistics is 

00:03:54.430 --> 00:03:57.760
 supremely good then we are 

00:03:55.750 --> 00:04:00.880
 pending a meeting with the 

00:03:57.760 --> 00:04:02.350
 president of the cndh to study the 

00:04:00.880 --> 00:04:05.769
 solutions to the topic we did the 

00:04:02.350 --> 00:04:07.180
 proposal to the company what we 

00:04:05.769 --> 00:04:08.980
 We agree that they are going to do the 

00:04:07.180 --> 00:04:10.930
 modeling the proposal that we made 

00:04:08.980 --> 00:04:13.150
 that fundamentally is that they arrive in 

00:04:10.930 --> 00:04:14.780
 the last flight at the latest possible 

00:04:13.150 --> 00:04:17.299
 what can I bring 

00:04:14.780 --> 00:04:19.040
 let the morning hours go by as much as 

00:04:17.299 --> 00:04:21.079
 early possible we have some records 

00:04:19.040 --> 00:04:23.180
 that it is very feasible to always leave 

00:04:21.079 --> 00:04:25.550
 manizales at that time they are going to do 

00:04:23.180 --> 00:04:27.020
 the modeling and next week already 

00:04:25.550 --> 00:04:29.780
 with the modeling done and with 

00:04:27.020 --> 00:04:32.150
 again the exercise that we do here 

00:04:29.780 --> 00:04:33.500
 of internal city review sit and 

00:04:32.150 --> 00:04:34.969
 realize what are the decisions that 

00:04:33.500 --> 00:04:37.639
 we can take 

00:04:34.969 --> 00:04:39.409
 and from September 24 near the 

00:04:37.639 --> 00:04:41.869
 will no longer operate its aircraft in the 

00:04:39.409 --> 00:04:43.610
 manizales and armenia airports the 

00:04:41.869 --> 00:04:45.860
 information was confirmed by the administrator 

00:04:43.610 --> 00:04:47.419
 from the Nubia airport after a 

00:04:45.860 --> 00:04:49.489
 official statement of aeronautics 

00:04:47.419 --> 00:04:51.889
 The civil proceedings are being carried out to 

00:04:49.489 --> 00:04:53.599
 that avianca increases the frequencies and 

00:04:51.889 --> 00:04:55.699
 cover lan routes in addition to 

00:04:53.599 --> 00:04:59.409
 negotiate with other airlines that 

00:04:55.699 --> 00:04:59.409
 they could possibly get to the city 

00:04:59.540 --> 00:05:04.310
 airport means that we are left with another 

00:05:01.700 --> 00:05:06.700
 once with the monopoly of avianca although 

00:05:04.310 --> 00:05:08.660
 had that it's a very airline 

00:05:06.700 --> 00:05:13.720
 competitive 

00:05:08.660 --> 00:05:13.720
 has many security mechanisms 

00:05:14.060 --> 00:05:18.560
 we hope that with the flights that will 

00:05:16.790 --> 00:05:21.260
 increase to bianca pascuales inflate 

00:05:18.560 --> 00:05:22.730
 the front and if it's good we already 

00:05:21.260 --> 00:05:24.470
 We are making arrangements just like 

00:05:22.730 --> 00:05:26.720
 the governorate to bring the airline 

00:05:24.470 --> 00:05:28.820
 if it represents a loss but also 

00:05:26.720 --> 00:05:31.190
 It is clear to say that the avenue canceling 

00:05:28.820 --> 00:05:33.300
 flights very frequently both in the 

00:05:31.190 --> 00:05:34.860
 morning and in the afternoon 

00:05:33.300 --> 00:05:37.110
 the company's 

00:05:34.860 --> 00:05:40.710
 the airs and the airplanes that they use 

00:05:37.110 --> 00:05:42.990
 airs the 300 dash and the 100 dash 

00:05:40.710 --> 00:05:45.560
 Very old planes already spent 

00:05:42.990 --> 00:05:45.560
 technology
