00:00:58.379 --> 00:01:04.500
 people know this but some people 

00:01:00.960 --> 00:01:07.860
 and not the video is for people still 

00:01:04.500 --> 00:01:10.560

 adaptive screen optimize the 

00:01:32.159 --> 00:01:49.680
 level of brightness according to the light 

00:01:34.530 --> 00:02:01.649
 available increased almost nothing I'm going to play 

00:01:49.680 --> 00:02:04.110
 here for clothes automatic adaptive brightness 

00:02:01.649 --> 00:02:13.410
 what does he speak 

00:02:04.110 --> 00:02:19.850
 the tip is to leave it in place 

00:02:13.410 --> 00:02:24.570
 here we have over here then priority 

00:02:19.850 --> 00:02:26.550
 indefinitely for 15 minutes would be 

00:02:24.570 --> 00:02:28.560
 what star will appear what you see 

00:02:26.550 --> 00:02:32.040
 he starts to look like a little star who 

00:02:28.560 --> 00:02:35.520
 priority priority than of the 

00:02:32.040 --> 00:02:37.290
 Sound calls to be able to 

00:02:35.520 --> 00:02:45.090
 playing let's go let's define here 

00:02:37.290 --> 00:02:46.440
 then receive calls up to 15 minutes 

00:02:45.090 --> 00:02:49.170
 notifications only allow 

00:02:46.440 --> 00:02:50.880
 priority interruptions events 

00:02:49.170 --> 00:02:51.930
 reminders then called here in the 

00:02:50.880 --> 00:02:54.330
 calls 

00:02:51.930 --> 00:02:55.680
 you can define for which people who 

00:02:54.330 --> 00:02:58.020
 Do you want me to make it there? 

00:02:55.680 --> 00:03:00.390
 priority 

00:02:58.020 --> 00:03:03.950
 right for your phone to ring only for 

00:03:00.390 --> 00:03:03.950
 those people you want 

00:03:07.460 --> 00:03:13.860
 indefinitely forever 

00:03:11.160 --> 00:03:20.330
 14 minutes but you can increase the 

00:03:13.860 --> 00:03:22.950
 time at the right time and none at all 

00:03:20.330 --> 00:03:25.680
 indefinitely 

00:03:22.950 --> 00:03:29.250
 There will not be an alarm there will not be 

00:03:25.680 --> 00:03:31.620
 vibrate nothing and for four hours you 

00:03:29.250 --> 00:03:33.420
 leave him quietly alice will enter 

00:03:31.620 --> 00:03:35.270
 but it did not meet important and come here is 

00:03:33.420 --> 00:03:38.930
 just for a meeting time ready 

00:03:35.270 --> 00:03:42.900
 You will not receive anything. 

00:03:38.930 --> 00:03:45.600
 the right personal handset here is very 

00:03:42.900 --> 00:03:48.810
 similar to this airplane mode 

00:03:45.600 --> 00:03:51.120
 airplane mode it leaves only mode 

00:03:48.810 --> 00:03:53.580
 Your phone is off. 

00:03:51.120 --> 00:03:56.430
 it cuts off all connections and you get 

00:03:53.580 --> 00:03:59.690
 only one with the screen turned on only being 

00:03:56.430 --> 00:04:02.670
 They say the best way for you. 

00:03:59.690 --> 00:04:04.260
 charging the phone with the screen was 

00:04:02.670 --> 00:04:06.060
 would be put into plane mode because you 

00:04:04.260 --> 00:04:08.220
 cut all communications you do not 

00:04:06.060 --> 00:04:10.770
 receive nothing it will carry 

00:04:08.220 --> 00:04:17.280
 faster this is a tip and they gave 

00:04:10.770 --> 00:04:19.669
 once the battery economy goes 

00:04:17.280 --> 00:04:19.669

 there are 15 already we are in 5.1.1 it already has 

00:04:26.910 --> 00:04:35.669
 that scheme of battery and the economy 

00:04:31.590 --> 00:04:39.060
 is automatically activated never 

00:04:35.669 --> 00:04:43.320
 when the battery is 5% or 15 

00:04:39.060 --> 00:04:46.949
 percent number four as 

00:04:43.320 --> 00:04:49.560

00:04:46.949 --> 00:04:53.070
 The phone crashed and now I do not have 

00:04:49.560 --> 00:04:55.259

00:04:53.070 --> 00:04:59.160
