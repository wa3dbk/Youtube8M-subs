I'm<00:00:15.460> using<00:00:15.700> an<00:00:16.059> acrylic<00:00:16.930> bristle<00:00:17.859> brush<00:00:18.369> here

00:00:18.750 --> 00:00:18.760 
I'm using an acrylic bristle brush here

00:00:18.760 --> 00:00:21.480 
I'm using an acrylic bristle brush here
and<00:00:19.500> we're<00:00:20.500> going<00:00:20.650> to<00:00:20.710> go<00:00:20.859> into<00:00:21.100> the<00:00:21.220> color

00:00:21.480 --> 00:00:21.490 
and we're going to go into the color

00:00:21.490 --> 00:00:27.570 
and we're going to go into the color
panel<00:00:21.789> and<00:00:22.210> just<00:00:22.990> move<00:00:23.560> the<00:00:25.890> cursor<00:00:26.890> around<00:00:27.010> on

00:00:27.570 --> 00:00:27.580 
panel and just move the cursor around on

00:00:27.580 --> 00:00:31.349 
panel and just move the cursor around on
the<00:00:27.760> hewing<00:00:29.609> and<00:00:30.609> then<00:00:30.730> we're<00:00:30.849> going<00:00:30.939> to<00:00:31.000> go<00:00:31.150> in

00:00:31.349 --> 00:00:31.359 
the hewing and then we're going to go in

00:00:31.359 --> 00:00:35.160 
the hewing and then we're going to go in
to<00:00:31.810> the<00:00:32.700> saturation<00:00:33.700> value<00:00:34.210> triangle<00:00:34.989> and

00:00:35.160 --> 00:00:35.170 
to the saturation value triangle and

00:00:35.170 --> 00:00:39.000 
to the saturation value triangle and
you'll<00:00:35.800> see<00:00:36.130> here<00:00:36.460> that<00:00:36.719> we<00:00:37.719> go<00:00:38.530> left<00:00:38.800> and

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:39.010 
you'll see here that we go left and

00:00:39.010 --> 00:00:41.780 
you'll see here that we go left and
right<00:00:39.190> right<00:00:40.149> takes<00:00:40.570> us<00:00:40.750> to<00:00:41.050> very<00:00:41.379> saturated

00:00:41.780 --> 00:00:41.790 
right right takes us to very saturated

00:00:41.790 --> 00:00:45.660 
right right takes us to very saturated
left<00:00:42.790> takes<00:00:43.149> us<00:00:43.360> to<00:00:43.600> gray<00:00:43.809> and<00:00:44.340> if<00:00:45.340> we<00:00:45.489> go<00:00:45.640> up

00:00:45.660 --> 00:00:45.670 
left takes us to gray and if we go up

00:00:45.670 --> 00:00:48.330 
left takes us to gray and if we go up
and<00:00:46.120> down<00:00:46.469> down<00:00:47.469> is<00:00:47.770> as<00:00:47.920> if<00:00:48.070> we're<00:00:48.250> adding

00:00:48.330 --> 00:00:48.340 
and down down is as if we're adding

00:00:48.340 --> 00:00:53.430 
and down down is as if we're adding
black<00:00:49.180> to<00:00:49.480> the<00:00:50.010> pigment<00:00:51.010> and<00:00:51.420> up<00:00:52.420> is<00:00:53.020> as<00:00:53.260> if

00:00:53.430 --> 00:00:53.440 
black to the pigment and up is as if

00:00:53.440 --> 00:00:55.920 
black to the pigment and up is as if
we're<00:00:53.649> adding<00:00:53.829> white<00:00:54.280> so<00:00:54.969> basically<00:00:55.390> by

00:00:55.920 --> 00:00:55.930 
we're adding white so basically by

00:00:55.930 --> 00:00:58.860 
we're adding white so basically by
moving<00:00:56.320> these<00:00:56.440> two<00:00:56.739> cursors<00:00:57.010> we<00:00:57.879> have<00:00:58.149> pretty

00:00:58.860 --> 00:00:58.870 
moving these two cursors we have pretty

00:00:58.870 --> 00:01:02.700 
moving these two cursors we have pretty
much<00:00:58.960> full<00:00:59.079> control<00:00:59.890> over<00:01:00.160> the<00:01:01.379> color<00:01:02.379> that

00:01:02.700 --> 00:01:02.710 
much full control over the color that

00:01:02.710 --> 00:01:06.179 
much full control over the color that
we're<00:01:02.890> choosing<00:01:03.309> now<00:01:04.149> this<00:01:04.479> same<00:01:05.189> hewing

00:01:06.179 --> 00:01:06.189 
we're choosing now this same hewing

we're choosing now this same hewing
saturation<00:01:06.970> value<00:01:07.270> triangle<00:01:07.750> is<00:01:08.100> accessible

00:01:09.090 --> 00:01:09.100 
saturation value triangle is accessible

00:01:09.100 --> 00:01:13.560 
saturation value triangle is accessible
if<00:01:09.659> we<00:01:10.659> use<00:01:10.960> that<00:01:10.990> shortcut<00:01:11.700> for<00:01:12.700> temple<00:01:13.330> color

00:01:13.560 --> 00:01:13.570 
if we use that shortcut for temple color

can minimize it by going to the pop-up
menu<00:01:26.740> and<00:01:27.159> unchecking<00:01:27.850> color<00:01:28.210> info<00:01:28.689> there's<00:01:29.200> a

00:01:29.280 --> 00:01:29.290 
menu and unchecking color info there's a

00:01:29.290 --> 00:01:32.910 
menu and unchecking color info there's a
clone<00:01:29.710> color<00:01:30.250> button<00:01:30.850> here<00:01:31.150> and<00:01:31.560> when<00:01:32.560> we<00:01:32.590> pick

clone color button here and when we pick

00:01:32.920 --> 00:01:35.700 
clone color button here and when we pick
it<00:01:33.030> we<00:01:34.030> notice<00:01:34.689> that<00:01:34.869> we're<00:01:35.049> getting<00:01:35.380> a<00:01:35.470> color

00:01:35.700 --> 00:01:35.710 
it we notice that we're getting a color

00:01:35.710 --> 00:01:38.310 
it we notice that we're getting a color
other<00:01:36.130> than<00:01:36.490> the<00:01:37.030> color<00:01:37.240> from<00:01:37.509> obviously<00:01:38.229> the

00:01:38.310 --> 00:01:38.320 
other than the color from obviously the

00:01:38.320 --> 00:01:41.039 
other than the color from obviously the
color<00:01:38.619> wheel<00:01:38.939> this<00:01:39.939> is<00:01:40.090> looking<00:01:40.479> at<00:01:40.810> what's

00:01:41.039 --> 00:01:41.049 
color wheel this is looking at what's

00:01:41.049 --> 00:01:43.319 
color wheel this is looking at what's
called<00:01:41.290> a<00:01:41.320> cloned<00:01:41.650> source<00:01:42.159> for<00:01:42.520> color<00:01:42.729> and<00:01:43.000> the

00:01:43.319 --> 00:01:43.329 
called a cloned source for color and the

00:01:43.329 --> 00:01:45.120 
called a cloned source for color and the
default<00:01:43.750> clone<00:01:43.990> source<00:01:44.290> is<00:01:44.590> a<00:01:44.649> current

00:01:45.120 --> 00:01:45.130 
default clone source is a current

00:01:45.130 --> 00:01:47.969 
default clone source is a current
pattern<00:01:45.579> which<00:01:46.270> right<00:01:46.630> now<00:01:46.659> is<00:01:47.229> the<00:01:47.320> hens<00:01:47.740> and

00:01:47.969 --> 00:01:47.979 
pattern which right now is the hens and

00:01:47.979 --> 00:01:50.399 
pattern which right now is the hens and
chicks<00:01:48.220> pattern<00:01:48.640> and<00:01:48.850> as<00:01:49.420> I<00:01:49.450> change<00:01:49.600> the

00:01:50.399 --> 00:01:50.409 
chicks pattern and as I change the

00:01:50.409 --> 00:01:53.550 
chicks pattern and as I change the
patterns<00:01:50.799> here<00:01:51.600> just<00:01:52.600> by<00:01:52.750> clicking<00:01:52.990> on<00:01:53.320> them

00:01:53.550 --> 00:01:53.560 
patterns here just by clicking on them

00:01:53.560 --> 00:01:58.620 
patterns here just by clicking on them
in<00:01:53.829> the<00:01:54.750> patterns<00:01:56.070> selector<00:01:57.070> here<00:01:57.399> you'll<00:01:58.299> see

00:01:58.620 --> 00:01:58.630 
in the patterns selector here you'll see

00:01:58.630 --> 00:02:01.560 
in the patterns selector here you'll see
that<00:01:58.930> the<00:01:59.170> color<00:01:59.439> changes<00:02:00.130> accordingly<00:02:00.850> we'll

00:02:01.560 --> 00:02:01.570 
that the color changes accordingly we'll

00:02:01.570 --> 00:02:04.859 
that the color changes accordingly we'll
uncheck<00:02:01.840> the<00:02:02.409> clone<00:02:02.680> color<00:02:03.009> and<00:02:03.659> we'll<00:02:04.659> look

00:02:04.859 --> 00:02:04.869 
uncheck the clone color and we'll look

00:02:04.869 --> 00:02:07.620 
uncheck the clone color and we'll look
at<00:02:05.049> using<00:02:05.259> the<00:02:05.469> mixer<00:02:05.950> instead<00:02:06.490> which<00:02:07.360> we<00:02:07.540> can

00:02:07.620 --> 00:02:07.630 
at using the mixer instead which we can

00:02:07.630 --> 00:02:12.570 
at using the mixer instead which we can
go<00:02:07.780> in<00:02:07.990> and<00:02:08.610> use<00:02:10.440> an<00:02:11.440> eyedropper<00:02:11.739> there<00:02:12.340> so

00:02:12.570 --> 00:02:12.580 
go in and use an eyedropper there so

00:02:12.580 --> 00:02:13.440 
go in and use an eyedropper there so
even<00:02:12.849> though<00:02:12.970> we<00:02:13.090> have

00:02:13.440 --> 00:02:13.450 
even though we have

00:02:13.450 --> 00:02:16.170 
even though we have
brush<00:02:13.780> selected<00:02:14.470> here<00:02:14.860> it's<00:02:15.700> got<00:02:16.030> the

00:02:16.170 --> 00:02:16.180 
brush selected here it's got the

00:02:16.180 --> 00:02:18.059 
brush selected here it's got the
eyedropper<00:02:16.750> in<00:02:16.840> the<00:02:16.959> mixer<00:02:17.319> pad<00:02:17.530> and

00:02:18.059 --> 00:02:18.069 
eyedropper in the mixer pad and

00:02:18.069 --> 00:02:20.910 
eyedropper in the mixer pad and
incidentally<00:02:18.790> we<00:02:19.480> can<00:02:19.629> always<00:02:20.110> hold<00:02:20.560> down<00:02:20.739> on

00:02:20.910 --> 00:02:20.920 
incidentally we can always hold down on

00:02:20.920 --> 00:02:24.509 
incidentally we can always hold down on
the<00:02:20.950> Mac<00:02:21.790> option<00:02:22.450> key<00:02:22.750> on<00:02:23.050> the<00:02:23.200> PC<00:02:23.920> the<00:02:24.190> Alt<00:02:24.370> key

the Mac option key on the PC the Alt key

00:02:24.519 --> 00:02:29.910 
the Mac option key on the PC the Alt key
and<00:02:24.879> pick<00:02:25.569> color<00:02:26.280> from<00:02:27.280> within<00:02:28.239> an<00:02:28.510> image<00:02:28.920> so

00:02:29.910 --> 00:02:29.920 
and pick color from within an image so

00:02:29.920 --> 00:02:33.300 
and pick color from within an image so
that<00:02:30.130> just<00:02:30.340> turns<00:02:30.610> our<00:02:31.620> cursor<00:02:32.620> into<00:02:32.920> an

00:02:33.300 --> 00:02:33.310 
that just turns our cursor into an

00:02:33.310 --> 00:02:35.100 
that just turns our cursor into an
eyedropper<00:02:33.489> tool<00:02:34.000> temporarily<00:02:34.300> while<00:02:34.959> we

00:02:42.690 --> 00:02:42.700 
multiple colors so for instance if we

00:02:42.700 --> 00:02:44.839 
multiple colors so for instance if we
click<00:02:42.970> on<00:02:43.120> the<00:02:43.239> sample<00:02:43.480> multiple<00:02:44.140> colors<00:02:44.530> and

00:02:44.839 --> 00:02:44.849 
click on the sample multiple colors and

00:02:44.849 --> 00:02:49.170 
click on the sample multiple colors and
click<00:02:45.849> at<00:02:46.120> a<00:02:46.480> point<00:02:47.170> where<00:02:47.410> we<00:02:47.560> have<00:02:47.799> a<00:02:48.099> mix<00:02:48.970> of

00:02:49.170 --> 00:02:49.180 
click at a point where we have a mix of

00:02:49.180 --> 00:02:51.059 
click at a point where we have a mix of
colors<00:02:49.630> you'll<00:02:49.840> see<00:02:50.049> that<00:02:50.230> we<00:02:50.319> get<00:02:50.560> that<00:02:50.739> mix

00:02:51.059 --> 00:02:51.069 
colors you'll see that we get that mix

00:02:51.069 --> 00:02:54.949 
colors you'll see that we get that mix
and<00:02:51.519> we<00:02:51.910> can<00:02:52.090> in<00:02:52.299> fact<00:02:52.510> use<00:02:53.250> the<00:02:54.250> different

00:02:54.949 --> 00:02:54.959 
and we can in fact use the different

00:02:54.959 --> 00:02:59.330 
and we can in fact use the different
color<00:02:55.959> mixes<00:02:56.530> to<00:02:56.950> get<00:02:57.069> different<00:02:57.280> mixes<00:02:57.930> and

00:02:59.330 --> 00:02:59.340 
color mixes to get different mixes and

00:02:59.340 --> 00:03:05.940 
color mixes to get different mixes and
you<00:03:00.340> can<00:03:00.549> pretty<00:03:01.180> much<00:03:01.269> load<00:03:01.750> in<00:03:04.349> any<00:03:05.349> image

00:03:05.940 --> 00:03:05.950 
you can pretty much load in any image

00:03:05.950 --> 00:03:08.880 
you can pretty much load in any image
into<00:03:06.459> this<00:03:06.610> mixer<00:03:07.150> and<00:03:07.989> use<00:03:08.349> it<00:03:08.530> in<00:03:08.680> this<00:03:08.829> way

00:03:08.880 --> 00:03:08.890 
into this mixer and use it in this way

00:03:08.890 --> 00:03:10.699 
into this mixer and use it in this way
so<00:03:09.069> you'll<00:03:09.310> see<00:03:09.489> we<00:03:09.610> get<00:03:09.730> some<00:03:09.940> really<00:03:10.150> nice

00:03:10.699 --> 00:03:10.709 
so you'll see we get some really nice

00:03:10.709 --> 00:03:13.770 
so you'll see we get some really nice
mixes<00:03:11.709> of<00:03:11.950> color<00:03:12.280> using<00:03:12.730> the<00:03:13.090> color<00:03:13.329> mixer

00:03:13.770 --> 00:03:13.780 
mixes of color using the color mixer

00:03:13.780 --> 00:03:16.170 
mixes of color using the color mixer
then<00:03:14.440> we<00:03:14.560> move<00:03:14.739> on<00:03:14.920> to<00:03:15.010> the<00:03:15.160> color<00:03:15.430> set<00:03:15.700> library

00:03:16.170 --> 00:03:16.180 
then we move on to the color set library

00:03:16.180 --> 00:03:18.180 
then we move on to the color set library
this<00:03:16.870> is<00:03:17.019> very<00:03:17.230> straightforward<00:03:17.530> you<00:03:17.980> just

00:03:18.180 --> 00:03:18.190 
this is very straightforward you just

00:03:18.190 --> 00:03:21.990 
this is very straightforward you just
click<00:03:19.150> on<00:03:19.470> swatch<00:03:20.470> and<00:03:20.799> that's<00:03:21.549> the<00:03:21.760> color

00:03:21.990 --> 00:03:22.000 
click on swatch and that's the color

00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:25.680 
click on swatch and that's the color
that's<00:03:22.239> selected<00:03:22.900> this<00:03:23.470> current<00:03:24.389> color<00:03:25.389> set

00:03:25.680 --> 00:03:25.690 
that's selected this current color set

00:03:25.690 --> 00:03:29.970 
that's selected this current color set
is<00:03:25.870> based<00:03:26.560> on<00:03:26.889> traditional<00:03:27.670> oil<00:03:28.660> paint<00:03:29.440> colors

00:03:29.970 --> 00:03:29.980 
is based on traditional oil paint colors

00:03:29.980 --> 00:03:34.220 
is based on traditional oil paint colors
and<00:03:30.010> we<00:03:30.340> can<00:03:30.489> see<00:03:30.700> this<00:03:30.880> if<00:03:31.120> we<00:03:31.269> just<00:03:31.299> go<00:03:31.690> to<00:03:33.180> the

00:03:34.220 --> 00:03:34.230 
and we can see this if we just go to the

00:03:34.230 --> 00:03:38.099 
and we can see this if we just go to the
pop-up<00:03:35.230> menu<00:03:35.650> and<00:03:35.829> just<00:03:36.450> have<00:03:37.450> a<00:03:37.480> look<00:03:37.720> at<00:03:37.870> the

00:03:38.099 --> 00:03:38.109 
pop-up menu and just have a look at the

00:03:38.109 --> 00:03:41.250 
pop-up menu and just have a look at the
view<00:03:38.440> as<00:03:39.250> a<00:03:39.280> list<00:03:39.760> you'll<00:03:40.150> see<00:03:40.239> that<00:03:40.690> list<00:03:41.049> is

00:03:41.250 --> 00:03:41.260 
view as a list you'll see that list is

00:03:41.260 --> 00:03:43.379 
view as a list you'll see that list is
actually<00:03:41.440> all<00:03:41.950> the<00:03:42.130> traditional<00:03:42.670> all<00:03:42.910> colors

00:03:43.379 --> 00:03:43.389 
actually all the traditional all colors

00:03:43.389 --> 00:03:45.539 
actually all the traditional all colors
I'm<00:03:43.630> gonna<00:03:43.810> go<00:03:43.959> back<00:03:44.170> to<00:03:44.470> the<00:03:44.769> color<00:03:45.190> set

00:03:45.539 --> 00:03:45.549 
I'm gonna go back to the color set

00:03:45.549 --> 00:03:48.300 
I'm gonna go back to the color set
library<00:03:46.030> view<00:03:46.269> and<00:03:46.650> we'll<00:03:47.650> look<00:03:47.829> at<00:03:48.010> it<00:03:48.040> as

00:03:48.300 --> 00:03:48.310 
library view and we'll look at it as

00:03:48.310 --> 00:03:51.720 
library view and we'll look at it as
medium<00:03:48.970> there<00:03:49.690> we<00:03:49.810> go<00:03:49.959> so<00:03:50.620> the<00:03:50.769> medium<00:03:51.220> gives

00:03:51.720 --> 00:03:51.730 
medium there we go so the medium gives

00:03:51.730 --> 00:03:53.879 
medium there we go so the medium gives
us<00:03:51.880> bigger<00:03:52.150> swatches<00:03:52.810> but<00:03:53.440> then<00:03:53.590> we<00:03:53.709> have<00:03:53.859> to

00:03:53.879 --> 00:03:53.889 
us bigger swatches but then we have to

00:03:53.889 --> 00:03:57.960 
us bigger swatches but then we have to
scroll<00:03:54.310> around<00:03:54.760> to<00:03:55.000> see<00:03:55.209> everything<00:03:55.480> and<00:03:56.970> the

00:03:57.960 --> 00:03:57.970 
scroll around to see everything and the

00:03:57.970 --> 00:04:00.660 
scroll around to see everything and the
small<00:03:58.420> gives<00:03:59.319> us<00:03:59.560> that<00:03:59.799> set<00:04:00.190> that<00:04:00.370> we<00:04:00.489> saw

00:04:00.660 --> 00:04:00.670 
small gives us that set that we saw

00:04:00.670 --> 00:04:03.720 
small gives us that set that we saw
earlier<00:04:01.150> but<00:04:01.720> one<00:04:02.530> nice<00:04:02.889> thing<00:04:02.920> about<00:04:03.250> this

00:04:03.720 --> 00:04:03.730 
earlier but one nice thing about this

00:04:03.730 --> 00:04:06.690 
earlier but one nice thing about this
color<00:04:04.450> set<00:04:04.720> library<00:04:05.139> is<00:04:05.290> it's<00:04:05.500> very<00:04:05.560> easy<00:04:05.799> to

00:04:06.690 --> 00:04:06.700 
color set library is it's very easy to

00:04:06.700 --> 00:04:09.449 
color set library is it's very easy to
create<00:04:06.970> your<00:04:07.209> own<00:04:07.239> color<00:04:07.750> sets<00:04:08.049> from<00:04:08.590> imagery

00:04:09.449 --> 00:04:09.459 
create your own color sets from imagery

00:04:09.459 --> 00:04:12.390 
create your own color sets from imagery
that<00:04:10.150> you<00:04:10.299> open<00:04:10.690> in<00:04:10.810> painter<00:04:11.169> so<00:04:11.769> for<00:04:12.010> instance

00:04:12.390 --> 00:04:12.400

de fée wonderful painter this was dated
about<00:04:20.820> 1927<00:04:21.820> so<00:04:22.479> suppose<00:04:22.750> we<00:04:22.780> want<00:04:22.930> to<00:04:23.080> make<00:04:23.200> a

00:04:23.219 --> 00:04:23.229 
about 1927 so suppose we want to make a

00:04:23.229 --> 00:04:25.800 
about 1927 so suppose we want to make a
color<00:04:23.500> set<00:04:23.770> from<00:04:23.919> these<00:04:24.130> colors<00:04:24.640> then<00:04:25.330> all<00:04:25.659> we

00:04:25.800 --> 00:04:25.810 
color set from these colors then all we

00:04:25.810 --> 00:04:26.760 
color set from these colors then all we
have<00:04:25.960> to<00:04:26.140> do

00:04:26.760 --> 00:04:26.770 
have to do

00:04:26.770 --> 00:04:29.550 
have to do
is<00:04:26.830> go<00:04:27.729> to<00:04:27.789> the<00:04:28.389> pop-up-menu<00:04:28.750> in<00:04:29.229> the<00:04:29.319> color

00:04:29.550 --> 00:04:29.560 
is go to the pop-up-menu in the color

00:04:29.560 --> 00:04:32.010 
is go to the pop-up-menu in the color
set<00:04:29.830> and<00:04:30.039> we<00:04:30.639> go<00:04:30.789> new<00:04:31.030> color<00:04:31.270> set<00:04:31.539> from<00:04:31.720> image

00:04:32.010 --> 00:04:32.020 
set and we go new color set from image

00:04:32.020 --> 00:04:34.860 
set and we go new color set from image
and<00:04:32.199> one<00:04:32.379> new<00:04:32.889> thing<00:04:33.190> in<00:04:33.430> Painter<00:04:34.180> x3<00:04:34.210> is<00:04:34.750> the

00:04:34.860 --> 00:04:34.870 
and one new thing in Painter x3 is the

00:04:34.870 --> 00:04:36.990 
and one new thing in Painter x3 is the
ability<00:04:35.319> to<00:04:35.349> control<00:04:35.889> the<00:04:36.190> number<00:04:36.490> of<00:04:36.610> colors

00:04:36.990 --> 00:04:37.000 
ability to control the number of colors

00:04:37.000 --> 00:04:38.969 
ability to control the number of colors
it<00:04:37.509> used<00:04:37.750> to<00:04:37.870> be<00:04:37.990> that<00:04:38.139> we<00:04:38.319> just<00:04:38.500> always<00:04:38.800> got<00:04:38.949> a

00:04:38.969 --> 00:04:38.979 
it used to be that we just always got a

00:04:38.979 --> 00:04:41.430 
it used to be that we just always got a
huge<00:04:39.400> number<00:04:39.580> of<00:04:39.729> colors<00:04:40.180> sometimes<00:04:40.810> too<00:04:41.259> many

00:04:41.430 --> 00:04:41.440 
huge number of colors sometimes too many

00:04:41.440 --> 00:04:45.119 
huge number of colors sometimes too many
so<00:04:41.710> here<00:04:41.949> supposing<00:04:42.639> I<00:04:42.729> want<00:04:42.879> say<00:04:43.949> let's<00:04:44.949> say
