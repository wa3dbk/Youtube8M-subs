know well how to make software and it's

00:01:15.450 --> 00:01:18.320 
know well how to make software and it's
quite<00:01:15.720> different<00:01:15.900> from<00:01:16.860> time<00:01:17.520> to<00:01:17.670> time<00:01:17.700> so<00:01:17.880> the

00:01:18.320 --> 00:01:18.330 
quite different from time to time so the

00:01:18.330 --> 00:01:19.580 
quite different from time to time so the
merge<00:01:18.540> i<00:01:18.750> think<00:01:19.020> is<00:01:19.080> something<00:01:19.260> that<00:01:19.410> was<00:01:19.560> a

00:01:19.580 --> 00:01:19.590 
merge i think is something that was a

00:01:19.590 --> 00:01:21.200 
merge i think is something that was a
little<00:01:19.680> bit<00:01:19.860> overdue<00:01:20.220> in<00:01:20.340> the<00:01:20.430> market<00:01:20.760> so<00:01:20.970> we

00:01:21.200 --> 00:01:21.210 
little bit overdue in the market so we

00:01:21.210 --> 00:01:22.850 
little bit overdue in the market so we
hope<00:01:21.690> that<00:01:21.750> we<00:01:22.020> have<00:01:22.050> a<00:01:22.230> good<00:01:22.440> software<00:01:22.710> out

00:01:22.850 --> 00:01:22.860 
hope that we have a good software out

00:01:22.860 --> 00:01:25.310 
hope that we have a good software out
there<00:01:22.890> that<00:01:23.220> is<00:01:23.310> while<00:01:23.700> engineered<00:01:24.240> and<00:01:24.450> has<00:01:25.080> a

00:01:25.310 --> 00:01:25.320 
there that is while engineered and has a

00:02:42.370 --> 00:02:43.589 
friend of mine took that in Egypt one
solution<00:02:42.519> is<00:02:42.730> to<00:02:42.849> put<00:02:43.000> one<00:02:43.120> of<00:02:43.239> those<00:02:43.360> you

00:02:43.589 --> 00:02:43.599 
solution is to put one of those you

00:02:43.599 --> 00:02:45.360 
solution is to put one of those you
point<00:02:43.870> control<00:02:44.170> points<00:02:44.590> onto<00:02:44.769> the<00:02:45.010> picture

and the contrast I can actually bring

00:03:07.220 --> 00:03:08.950 
and the contrast I can actually bring
bring<00:03:07.730> the<00:03:07.850> face<00:03:08.150> of<00:03:08.180> and<00:03:08.450> look<00:03:08.600> more<00:03:08.720> to<00:03:08.840> the

00:03:08.950 --> 00:03:08.960 
bring the face of and look more to the

00:03:08.960 --> 00:03:10.510 
bring the face of and look more to the
floor<00:03:09.170> run<00:03:09.320> so<00:03:09.440> it<00:03:09.530> will<00:03:09.650> print<00:03:09.950> well<00:03:10.190> and<00:03:10.400> when

00:03:10.510 --> 00:03:10.520 
floor run so it will print well and when

00:03:10.520 --> 00:03:11.950 
floor run so it will print well and when
you<00:03:10.610> when<00:03:11.000> you<00:03:11.030> see<00:03:11.360> the<00:03:11.480> picture<00:03:11.780> on<00:03:11.810> the

00:03:11.950 --> 00:03:11.960 
you when you see the picture on the

00:03:11.960 --> 00:03:14.230 
you when you see the picture on the

00:03:14.230 --> 00:03:14.240 
screen the face is also in the optical

00:03:14.240 --> 00:03:18.040 
screen the face is also in the optical
focus<00:03:15.820> and<00:03:16.820> it's<00:03:17.210> feathered<00:03:17.600> I<00:03:17.720> see<00:03:17.930> the

00:03:18.040 --> 00:03:18.050 
focus and it's feathered I see the

00:03:18.050 --> 00:03:20.260

it's<00:03:20.510> going<00:03:20.570> to<00:03:20.840> start<00:03:21.230> but<00:03:21.620> it<00:03:21.830> doesn't

00:03:22.350 --> 00:03:22.360 
it's going to start but it doesn't

it's going to start but it doesn't
necessary<00:03:23.360> structured<00:03:23.810> effect<00:03:24.140> so<00:03:24.530> it's<00:03:24.920> not

necessary structured effect so it's not

00:03:24.980 --> 00:03:27.160 
necessary structured effect so it's not

completely<00:03:54.890> skip<00:03:55.190> the<00:03:55.340> concept<00:03:55.730> of<00:03:55.790> masking

00:03:56.260 --> 00:03:56.270 
completely skip the concept of masking

00:03:56.270 --> 00:03:58.300 
completely skip the concept of masking

00:04:04.449 --> 00:04:04.459 
on the original light that has been

00:04:04.459 --> 00:04:05.860 
on the original light that has been

there in the picture based on the

00:04:05.870 --> 00:04:07.960 
there in the picture based on the
original<00:04:05.930> structures<00:04:06.650> and<00:04:06.860> without<00:04:07.580> having

original structures and without having

00:04:07.970 --> 00:04:09.910 
original structures and without having
the<00:04:08.060> city<00:04:08.360> the<00:04:08.630> egg<00:04:08.989> creating<00:04:09.410> a<00:04:09.470> mask<00:04:09.709> in

00:04:09.910 --> 00:04:09.920 
the city the egg creating a mask in

00:04:09.920 --> 00:04:12.040 
the city the egg creating a mask in
between<00:04:10.280> because<00:04:10.940> whatever<00:04:11.269> you<00:04:11.600> have<00:04:11.780> mass

00:04:12.040 --> 00:04:12.050 
between because whatever you have mass

00:04:12.050 --> 00:04:13.870 
between because whatever you have mass
you<00:04:12.290> have<00:04:12.320> artifacting<00:04:13.100> whenever<00:04:13.670> you<00:04:13.760> have

00:04:13.870 --> 00:04:13.880 
you have artifacting whenever you have

00:04:13.880 --> 00:04:16.330 
you have artifacting whenever you have
you<00:04:14.269> have<00:04:14.300> masks<00:04:14.989> working<00:04:15.350> together<00:04:15.500> you<00:04:16.250> will

00:04:16.330 --> 00:04:16.340 
you have masks working together you will

00:04:16.340 --> 00:04:17.800 
you have masks working together you will
have<00:04:16.549> a<00:04:16.580> transition<00:04:17.060> which<00:04:17.209> is<00:04:17.330> difficult<00:04:17.540> to

00:04:17.800 --> 00:04:17.810 
have a transition which is difficult to

00:04:17.810 --> 00:04:19.259 
have a transition which is difficult to
handle

00:04:19.259 --> 00:04:19.269 
handle

00:04:19.269 --> 00:04:21.360 
handle
now<00:04:20.019> this<00:04:20.139> has<00:04:20.289> been<00:04:20.410> a<00:04:20.470> very<00:04:20.620> simple<00:04:21.009> picture

00:04:21.360 --> 00:04:21.370 
now this has been a very simple picture

00:04:21.370 --> 00:04:23.430 
now this has been a very simple picture
it's<00:04:21.609> a<00:04:22.210> very<00:04:22.389> simple<00:04:22.539> effect<00:04:22.990> but<00:04:23.139> you<00:04:23.289> see

00:04:23.430 --> 00:04:23.440 
it's a very simple effect but you see

00:04:23.440 --> 00:04:25.589 
it's a very simple effect but you see
that<00:04:23.590> with<00:04:23.740> only<00:04:23.919> three<00:04:24.220> control<00:04:24.550> points<00:04:24.940> i

00:04:25.589 --> 00:04:25.599 
that with only three control points i

00:04:25.599 --> 00:04:28.860 
that with only three control points i
can<00:04:26.020> work<00:04:26.139> pretty<00:04:26.379> well<00:04:26.440> in<00:04:26.680> the<00:04:26.770> picture<00:04:27.870> you

00:04:28.860 --> 00:04:28.870 
can work pretty well in the picture you

00:04:28.870 --> 00:04:30.749 
can work pretty well in the picture you
can't<00:04:29.110> actually<00:04:29.319> make<00:04:29.620> control<00:04:30.220> points<00:04:30.580> work

00:04:30.749 --> 00:04:30.759 
can't actually make control points work

00:04:30.759 --> 00:04:32.610 
can't actually make control points work
together<00:04:30.970> or<00:04:31.419> compete<00:04:32.110> against<00:04:32.409> one<00:04:32.470> another

00:04:32.610 --> 00:04:32.620 
together or compete against one another

00:04:32.620 --> 00:04:35.850 
together or compete against one another
so<00:04:33.370> for<00:04:33.580> instance<00:04:34.199> the<00:04:35.199> trick<00:04:35.379> is<00:04:35.500> that<00:04:35.680> all

00:04:35.850 --> 00:04:35.860 
so for instance the trick is that all

00:04:35.860 --> 00:04:37.860 
so for instance the trick is that all
control<00:04:36.310> points<00:04:36.699> or<00:04:37.270> being<00:04:37.599> applied

00:04:37.860 --> 00:04:37.870 
control points or being applied

00:04:37.870 --> 00:04:39.600 
control points or being applied
simultaneous<00:04:38.590> to<00:04:38.770> the<00:04:38.889> picture<00:04:39.220> that<00:04:39.370> means

00:04:39.600 --> 00:04:39.610 
simultaneous to the picture that means

00:04:39.610 --> 00:04:42.779 
simultaneous to the picture that means
it's<00:04:40.330> not<00:04:40.419> one<00:04:40.780> control<00:04:41.590> point<00:04:41.800> first<00:04:42.069> then

00:04:42.779 --> 00:04:42.789 
it's not one control point first then

00:04:42.789 --> 00:04:44.879 
it's not one control point first then
the<00:04:42.909> next<00:04:43.000> one<00:04:43.270> then<00:04:43.750> the<00:04:43.900> third<00:04:44.080> one<00:04:44.139> but<00:04:44.740> they

00:04:44.879 --> 00:04:44.889 
the next one then the third one but they

00:04:44.889 --> 00:04:46.680 
the next one then the third one but they
all<00:04:45.129> to<00:04:45.400> get<00:04:45.520> together<00:04:45.789> flown<00:04:46.240> to<00:04:46.389> the<00:04:46.419> same

00:04:46.680 --> 00:04:46.690 
all to get together flown to the same

00:04:46.690 --> 00:04:49.499 
all to get together flown to the same
equations<00:04:47.289> into<00:04:47.710> the<00:04:47.830> same<00:04:48.039> routine<00:04:48.639> so<00:04:49.300> they

00:04:49.499 --> 00:04:49.509 
equations into the same routine so they

00:04:49.509 --> 00:04:51.149 
equations into the same routine so they
all<00:04:49.659> work<00:04:49.900> together<00:04:50.050> into<00:04:50.440> all<00:04:50.590> influence<00:04:51.039> one

00:04:51.149 --> 00:04:51.159 
all work together into all influence one

00:04:51.159 --> 00:04:53.040 
all work together into all influence one
another<00:04:51.190> so<00:04:52.120> for<00:04:52.270> instance<00:04:52.360> if<00:04:52.659> you<00:04:52.780> want<00:04:52.930> to

00:04:53.040 --> 00:04:53.050 
another so for instance if you want to

00:04:53.050 --> 00:04:57.330 
another so for instance if you want to
face<00:04:55.050> this<00:04:56.050> control<00:04:56.440> point<00:04:56.680> to<00:04:56.830> less<00:04:56.979> effect

00:04:57.330 --> 00:04:57.340 
face this control point to less effect

00:04:57.340 --> 00:04:59.460 
face this control point to less effect
this<00:04:57.490> area<00:04:57.909> you<00:04:58.090> just<00:04:58.150> put<00:04:58.569> with<00:04:59.050> another<00:04:59.289> one

00:04:59.460 --> 00:04:59.470 
this area you just put with another one

00:04:59.470 --> 00:05:01.690 
this area you just put with another one
here

00:05:01.690 --> 00:05:01.700 
here

00:05:01.700 --> 00:05:03.250 
here
bring<00:05:02.270> down<00:05:02.390> the<00:05:02.510> brightness<00:05:02.660> so<00:05:03.050> you<00:05:03.140> will

00:05:03.250 --> 00:05:03.260 
bring down the brightness so you will

00:05:03.260 --> 00:05:05.830 
bring down the brightness so you will
see<00:05:03.580> but<00:05:04.580> now<00:05:04.760> the<00:05:04.820> face<00:05:05.180> is<00:05:05.210> being<00:05:05.600> affected

00:05:05.830 --> 00:05:05.840 
see but now the face is being affected

00:05:05.840 --> 00:05:09.700 
see but now the face is being affected
but<00:05:06.140> this<00:05:06.320> area<00:05:06.500> is<00:05:06.620> not<00:05:06.830> being<00:05:07.040> affected<00:05:08.710> so

00:05:09.700 --> 00:05:09.710 
but this area is not being affected so

00:05:09.710 --> 00:05:13.390 
but this area is not being affected so
with<00:05:10.280> only<00:05:10.310> four<00:05:11.350> points<00:05:12.350> and<00:05:12.500> four<00:05:12.800> sliders<00:05:13.070> I

00:05:13.390 --> 00:05:13.400 
with only four points and four sliders I

00:05:13.400 --> 00:05:14.980 
with only four points and four sliders I
have<00:05:13.790> actually<00:05:14.150> make<00:05:14.300> this<00:05:14.420> picture<00:05:14.750> very

00:05:14.980 --> 00:05:14.990 
have actually make this picture very

00:05:14.990 --> 00:05:17.170 
have actually make this picture very
well<00:05:15.140> printable<00:05:15.650> it's<00:05:16.460> a<00:05:16.550> fantastic

00:05:17.170 --> 00:05:17.180 
well printable it's a fantastic

00:05:17.180 --> 00:05:18.640 
well printable it's a fantastic
demonstration<00:05:17.300> thank<00:05:18.020> you<00:05:18.110> very<00:05:18.290> much<00:05:18.440> for
