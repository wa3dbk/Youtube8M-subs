00:00:00.110 --> 00:00:05.100
 hello super manitu here and I wanted 

00:00:03.570 --> 00:00:09.080
 you guys today the new update of mine 

00:00:05.100 --> 00:00:12.480
 ort show the dispenser with what scott 

00:00:09.080 --> 00:00:15.540
 first there is a new blog and that though 

00:00:12.480 --> 00:00:19.109
 the braker can as the name already 

00:00:15.540 --> 00:00:22.890
 says blocks will break like that 

00:00:19.109 --> 00:00:24.600
 tasted and the old block the placer 

00:00:22.890 --> 00:00:29.550
 now has the right picture 

00:00:24.600 --> 00:00:31.949
 in the inventory and is thus tasted the 

00:00:29.550 --> 00:00:34.200
 Of course, both blocks can be in each one 

00:00:31.949 --> 00:00:36.000
 Any direction will be placed 

00:00:34.200 --> 00:00:40.469
 And each of the blocks has a special one 

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:44.460
 side has to go out here is the cross 

00:00:40.469 --> 00:00:47.010
 and here it is the upside down t here 

00:00:44.460 --> 00:00:51.899
 I have such a placer ready 

00:00:47.010 --> 00:00:55.820
 made with a stone I activate 

00:00:51.899 --> 00:01:03.270
 and just replace it in front of you 

00:00:55.820 --> 00:01:04.409
 He also works with red wings 

00:01:03.270 --> 00:01:06.900
 plant and he can do any 

00:01:04.409 --> 00:01:08.939
 plant other plant and he should 

00:01:06.900 --> 00:01:11.810
 also blocks of any mod 

00:01:08.939 --> 00:01:14.729
 I can sit here I have one 

00:01:11.810 --> 00:01:17.729
 prepared a blazer with a look 

00:01:14.729 --> 00:01:20.880
 normal dispenser with bruyneel and one 

00:01:17.729 --> 00:01:22.009
 break let's do it 

00:01:20.880 --> 00:01:26.400
 activate 

00:01:22.009 --> 00:01:30.990
 he planted sees the dispenser leaves 

00:01:26.400 --> 00:01:34.159
 this grow and the braker then collects 

00:01:30.990 --> 00:01:34.159
 to drop a 

00:01:35.360 --> 00:01:43.670
 Here johnwood is a blazer with 

00:01:39.360 --> 00:01:47.369
 corbijns and a break of the placer 

00:01:43.670 --> 00:01:50.970
 plants the coco rejects and the braker 

00:01:47.369 --> 00:01:55.350
 Collect them and get corbijns if 

00:01:50.970 --> 00:01:57.990
 you let it grow now and then 

00:01:55.350 --> 00:02:02.220
 of course you get more kaka 

00:01:57.990 --> 00:02:03.360
 bands as normal here too because 

00:02:02.220 --> 00:02:05.549
 People in the people asked me once 

00:02:03.360 --> 00:02:06.360
 have that on the other exactly with it 

00:02:05.549 --> 00:02:08.039
 can make 

00:02:06.360 --> 00:02:11.280
 I have a kind of mini here 

00:02:08.039 --> 00:02:15.019
 automatic farm here is a series 

00:02:11.280 --> 00:02:18.209
 of dispenser with water buckets drinne 

00:02:15.019 --> 00:02:21.480
 connected via this redstone cable and 

00:02:18.209 --> 00:02:23.730
 up there are placers over this network 

00:02:21.480 --> 00:02:28.200
 and cables are connected so i 

00:02:23.730 --> 00:02:30.239
 Now activate the placer to plant them 

00:02:28.200 --> 00:02:32.250
 for me she can then i will her 

00:02:30.239 --> 00:02:33.870
 grow either by time or 

00:02:32.250 --> 00:02:36.690
 we accelerate it as normal 

00:02:33.870 --> 00:02:39.170
 I only need a little bit once 

00:02:36.690 --> 00:02:44.130
 briefly activate the thing here 

00:02:39.170 --> 00:02:46.970
 the water flows a second time 

00:02:44.130 --> 00:02:50.299
 activating makes the water stop 

00:02:46.970 --> 00:02:53.010
 The items are in the hopper 

00:02:50.299 --> 00:02:58.410
 washed ashore and end up in the 

00:02:53.010 --> 00:03:00.870
 Chest and the water is always after 

00:02:58.410 --> 00:03:03.480
 still in the dispenser in there so pretty 

00:03:00.870 --> 00:03:05.209
 useful for a color can also be 

00:03:03.480 --> 00:03:09.060
 build arbitrarily big 

00:03:05.209 --> 00:03:12.150
 Here I have long wood and a blazer 

00:03:09.060 --> 00:03:17.370
 with corbijns underneath hopper the 

00:03:12.150 --> 00:03:21.120
 both slopes here and there and repeater 

00:03:17.370 --> 00:03:25.170
 to delay the signal so first 

00:03:21.120 --> 00:03:29.989
 look yes that is empty I activate the 

00:03:25.170 --> 00:03:29.989
 placer they put the two plants 

00:03:31.130 --> 00:03:38.720
 activate the plants in the pistes 

00:03:35.380 --> 00:03:43.520
 fall into the hopper and land on 

00:03:38.720 --> 00:03:49.310
 end in which the box works 

00:03:43.520 --> 00:03:52.240
 Of course, even with full-grown 

00:03:49.310 --> 00:03:52.240
 replace martina 

00:03:55.240 --> 00:04:01.030
 Now you have a lot more so too 

00:03:59.170 --> 00:04:03.580
 Braker is to no avail I have the 

00:04:01.030 --> 00:04:06.510
 company built up when we use this clock 

00:04:03.580 --> 00:04:06.510
 activate here 

00:04:09.510 --> 00:04:14.020
 then you can do it pretty cheap 

00:04:12.280 --> 00:04:16.030
 produce building material 

00:04:14.020 --> 00:04:19.150
 running water and flowing lava 

00:04:16.030 --> 00:04:23.200
 cable sound can be made with it 

00:04:19.150 --> 00:04:24.310
 simply the cheap building material 

00:04:23.200 --> 00:04:25.690
 then you either get that 

00:04:24.310 --> 00:04:27.850
 can process or for 

00:04:25.690 --> 00:04:30.000
 some huge tree project 

00:04:27.850 --> 00:04:32.650
 can use 

00:04:30.000 --> 00:04:34.750
 and that works fully automatically 

00:04:32.650 --> 00:04:37.570
 you could even join us now 

00:04:34.750 --> 00:04:38.560
 stools down here get the very've 

00:04:37.570 --> 00:04:41.980
 I did not do it now but it 

00:04:38.560 --> 00:04:44.110
 Of course, that would be it 

00:04:41.980 --> 00:04:45.250
 but again I hope you have that 

00:04:44.110 --> 00:04:47.460
 spotlight liked 

00:04:45.250 --> 00:04:49.180
 if i have any bugs or 

00:04:47.460 --> 00:04:51.100
 to come up with suggestions for improvement 

00:04:49.180 --> 00:04:52.930
