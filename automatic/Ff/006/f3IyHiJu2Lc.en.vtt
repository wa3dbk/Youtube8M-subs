okay to make a start a c-clamp we're
going<00:00:05.330> to<00:00:05.420> do<00:00:05.540> is<00:00:05.689> going<00:00:05.840> to<00:00:05.960> draw<00:00:06.170> on<00:00:06.380> the<00:00:06.590> top

00:00:06.969 --> 00:00:06.979 
going to do is going to draw on the top

00:00:06.979 --> 00:00:10.839 
going to do is going to draw on the top
plane<00:00:07.250> but<00:00:08.240> to<00:00:08.330> draw<00:00:08.480> two<00:00:08.750> circles<00:00:09.070> to<00:00:10.070> sketch

plane but to draw two circles to sketch
on<00:00:11.469> this<00:00:12.469> plane<00:00:13.360> you<00:00:14.360> sketch<00:00:14.780> two<00:00:15.110> circles

00:00:19.950 --> 00:00:19.960 

00:00:19.960 --> 00:00:26.050 

smart<00:00:20.960> dimension<00:00:21.439> them<00:00:21.619> one<00:00:22.250> is<00:00:25.060> 33

00:00:26.050 --> 00:00:26.060 
smart dimension them one is 33

00:00:26.060 --> 00:00:37.560 
smart dimension them one is 33
millimeters<00:00:29.679> and<00:00:30.679> one<00:00:31.070> is<00:00:33.670> 43<00:00:34.670> millimeters

00:00:37.560 --> 00:00:37.570 

00:00:37.570 --> 00:00:42.850 

three<00:00:39.970> next<00:00:40.970> thing<00:00:41.210> is<00:00:41.840> we<00:00:42.140> need<00:00:42.230> to<00:00:42.440> just<00:00:42.680> zoom

00:00:42.850 --> 00:00:42.860 
three next thing is we need to just zoom

00:00:42.860 --> 00:00:44.680 
three next thing is we need to just zoom
in<00:00:43.010> a<00:00:43.040> little<00:00:43.100> bit<00:00:43.280> and<00:00:44.150> we<00:00:44.360> need<00:00:44.450> to<00:00:44.510> put<00:00:44.660> a

00:00:44.680 --> 00:00:44.690 
in a little bit and we need to put a

00:00:44.690 --> 00:00:47.530 
in a little bit and we need to put a
center<00:00:45.050> line<00:00:45.230> using<00:00:46.220> center<00:00:46.880> line<00:00:47.060> tool<00:00:47.330> from

00:00:47.530 --> 00:00:47.540 
center line using center line tool from

00:00:47.540 --> 00:00:51.280 
center line using center line tool from
the<00:00:47.780> origin<00:00:48.250> straight<00:00:49.250> up<00:00:49.400> the<00:00:49.520> screen<00:00:50.290> so

00:00:51.280 --> 00:00:51.290 
the origin straight up the screen so

00:00:51.290 --> 00:00:54.130 
the origin straight up the screen so
it's<00:00:51.440> vertical<00:00:52.060> next<00:00:53.060> me<00:00:53.180> to<00:00:53.330> just<00:00:53.510> put<00:00:53.690> an<00:00:53.960> all

00:00:54.130 --> 00:00:54.140 
it's vertical next me to just put an all

00:00:54.140 --> 00:00:56.110 
it's vertical next me to just put an all
black<00:00:54.410> line<00:00:54.770> in<00:00:54.950> at<00:00:55.490> an<00:00:55.640> angle

00:00:56.110 --> 00:00:56.120 
black line in at an angle

00:00:56.120 --> 00:00:58.330 
black line in at an angle
give<00:00:56.870> me<00:00:56.930> two<00:00:57.050> dimension<00:00:57.590> between<00:00:57.950> these<00:00:58.130> two

00:00:58.330 --> 00:00:58.340 
give me two dimension between these two

00:00:58.340 --> 00:01:05.849 
give me two dimension between these two
lines<00:00:58.550> with<00:00:59.480> an<00:00:59.570> angle<00:01:00.020> of<00:01:00.820> 10<00:01:01.820> degrees

00:01:05.849 --> 00:01:05.859 

00:01:05.859 --> 00:01:07.569 

eventually<00:01:06.859> we're<00:01:06.950> going<00:01:07.100> to<00:01:07.159> is<00:01:07.340> going<00:01:07.369> to

00:01:07.569 --> 00:01:07.579 
eventually we're going to is going to

00:01:07.579 --> 00:01:10.209 
eventually we're going to is going to
mirror<00:01:07.789> this<00:01:07.969> onto<00:01:08.450> this<00:01:08.539> side<00:01:08.840> as<00:01:08.990> well<00:01:09.219> next

00:01:10.209 --> 00:01:10.219 
mirror this onto this side as well next

00:01:10.219 --> 00:01:12.639 
mirror this onto this side as well next
thing<00:01:10.280> we<00:01:10.460> do<00:01:10.520> is<00:01:10.789> put<00:01:10.939> two<00:01:11.119> more<00:01:11.359> lines<00:01:11.630> in<00:01:11.840> one

00:01:12.639 --> 00:01:12.649 
thing we do is put two more lines in one

00:01:12.649 --> 00:01:15.730 
thing we do is put two more lines in one
up<00:01:13.399> here<00:01:13.670> somewhere<00:01:14.119> and<00:01:14.960> one<00:01:15.200> coming<00:01:15.560> down

00:01:15.730 --> 00:01:15.740 
up here somewhere and one coming down

00:01:15.740 --> 00:01:17.080 
up here somewhere and one coming down
this<00:01:15.920> way<00:01:16.130> making<00:01:16.460> sure<00:01:16.700> that<00:01:16.880> that<00:01:17.030> is

00:01:17.080 --> 00:01:17.090 
this way making sure that that is

00:01:17.090 --> 00:01:20.950 
this way making sure that that is
vertical<00:01:17.719> as<00:01:18.079> well<00:01:18.759> you<00:01:19.759> can<00:01:19.969> then<00:01:20.149> use<00:01:20.810> the

00:01:20.950 --> 00:01:20.960 
vertical as well you can then use the

00:01:20.960 --> 00:01:23.340 
vertical as well you can then use the
trim<00:01:21.200> entities<00:01:21.350> tool<00:01:21.920> trim<00:01:22.460> to<00:01:22.579> the<00:01:22.609> closest

00:01:23.340 --> 00:01:23.350 
trim entities tool trim to the closest

00:01:23.350 --> 00:01:26.940 
trim entities tool trim to the closest
and<00:01:24.350> just<00:01:24.499> cut<00:01:25.100> that<00:01:25.219> top<00:01:25.460> piece<00:01:25.670> off<00:01:25.880> there

00:01:26.940 --> 00:01:26.950 
and just cut that top piece off there

00:01:26.950 --> 00:01:29.139 
and just cut that top piece off there
next<00:01:27.950> thing<00:01:28.039> need<00:01:28.159> to<00:01:28.219> do<00:01:28.280> is<00:01:28.399> smart<00:01:28.700> dimension

00:01:29.139 --> 00:01:29.149 
next thing need to do is smart dimension

00:01:29.149 --> 00:01:33.399 
next thing need to do is smart dimension
these<00:01:29.270> two<00:01:29.479> lines<00:01:29.749> will<00:01:30.640> use<00:01:32.409> seven

00:01:33.399 --> 00:01:33.409 
these two lines will use seven

00:01:33.409 --> 00:01:37.859 
these two lines will use seven
millimeters<00:01:34.179> and<00:01:35.979> for<00:01:36.979> this<00:01:37.100> one<00:01:37.369> we'll<00:01:37.819> use

00:01:37.859 --> 00:01:37.869 
millimeters and for this one we'll use

00:01:37.869 --> 00:01:45.789 
millimeters and for this one we'll use
15<00:01:41.590> okay<00:01:42.590> that's<00:01:42.920> that<00:01:43.100> sketch<00:01:43.399> comp<00:01:44.289> Retd<00:01:45.319> now

00:01:45.789 --> 00:01:45.799 
15 okay that's that sketch comp Retd now

00:01:45.799 --> 00:01:48.520 
15 okay that's that sketch comp Retd now
what<00:01:45.979> we<00:01:46.100> need<00:01:46.219> to<00:01:46.280> do<00:01:46.539> is<00:01:47.539> to<00:01:47.960> just<00:01:48.380> reflect

00:01:48.520 --> 00:01:48.530 
what we need to do is to just reflect

00:01:48.530 --> 00:01:52.059 
what we need to do is to just reflect
them<00:01:49.509> these<00:01:50.509> three<00:01:50.869> lines<00:01:51.170> across<00:01:51.710> the<00:01:51.950> other

00:01:52.059 --> 00:01:52.069 
them these three lines across the other

00:01:52.069 --> 00:01:54.879 
them these three lines across the other
side<00:01:52.280> so<00:01:52.670> I<00:01:52.729> have<00:01:52.759> two<00:01:52.969> mirror<00:01:53.210> entities<00:01:53.889> first

00:01:54.879 --> 00:01:54.889 
side so I have two mirror entities first

00:01:54.889 --> 00:01:56.050 
side so I have two mirror entities first
thing<00:01:55.069> it's<00:01:55.189> doing<00:01:55.280> is<00:01:55.460> asking<00:01:55.549> us<00:01:55.819> which

00:01:56.050 --> 00:01:56.060 
thing it's doing is asking us which

00:01:56.060 --> 00:01:57.819 
thing it's doing is asking us which
entities<00:01:56.569> you<00:01:56.689> want<00:01:56.840> to<00:01:56.990> mirror<00:01:57.170> entities<00:01:57.649> is

00:01:57.819 --> 00:01:57.829 
entities you want to mirror entities is

00:01:57.829 --> 00:01:59.469 
entities you want to mirror entities is
essentially<00:01:58.549> in<00:01:58.639> this<00:01:58.789> case<00:01:58.969> it's<00:01:59.119> the<00:01:59.240> lines

00:01:59.469 --> 00:01:59.479 
essentially in this case it's the lines

00:01:59.479 --> 00:02:01.660 
essentially in this case it's the lines
that<00:01:59.689> we<00:01:59.810> want<00:01:59.959> to<00:02:00.079> mirror<00:02:00.229> which<00:02:01.159> is<00:02:01.310> this

00:02:01.660 --> 00:02:01.670 
that we want to mirror which is this

00:02:01.670 --> 00:02:05.620 
that we want to mirror which is this
line<00:02:01.909> this<00:02:02.780> line<00:02:03.079> and<00:02:03.350> this<00:02:04.159> line<00:02:04.329> and<00:02:05.329> then

00:02:05.620 --> 00:02:05.630 
line this line and this line and then

00:02:05.630 --> 00:02:07.749 
line this line and this line and then
it's<00:02:05.780> asking<00:02:05.990> us<00:02:06.139> where<00:02:06.770> our<00:02:06.920> mirror<00:02:07.130> is<00:02:07.310> and<00:02:07.670> a

00:02:07.749 --> 00:02:07.759 
it's asking us where our mirror is and a

00:02:07.759 --> 00:02:09.160 
it's asking us where our mirror is and a
mirror<00:02:07.999> is<00:02:08.209> the<00:02:08.240> construction<00:02:08.840> line<00:02:09.020> we'll

00:02:09.160 --> 00:02:09.170 
mirror is the construction line we'll

00:02:09.170 --> 00:02:10.240 
mirror is the construction line we'll
put<00:02:09.319> in<00:02:09.440> the<00:02:09.530> middle

00:02:10.240 --> 00:02:10.250 
put in the middle

00:02:10.250 --> 00:02:12.040 
put in the middle
and<00:02:11.000> as<00:02:11.120> you<00:02:11.240> can<00:02:11.300> see<00:02:11.360> we've<00:02:11.660> got<00:02:11.750> a<00:02:11.810> yellow

00:02:12.040 --> 00:02:12.050 
and as you can see we've got a yellow

00:02:12.050 --> 00:02:13.840 
and as you can see we've got a yellow
preview<00:02:12.740> to<00:02:12.890> show<00:02:13.070> that<00:02:13.220> the<00:02:13.370> mayor<00:02:13.550> has<00:02:13.670> gone

00:02:13.840 --> 00:02:13.850 
preview to show that the mayor has gone

00:02:37.780 --> 00:02:43.710 
line powerful piece okay
and<00:02:38.780> you<00:02:38.870> should<00:02:39.020> trim<00:02:39.760> exit<00:02:40.760> the<00:02:40.850> sketch

00:02:43.710 --> 00:02:43.720 

00:02:43.720 --> 00:02:47.080 

spacebar<00:02:44.720> click<00:02:45.200> isometric<00:02:45.890> and<00:02:46.640> then<00:02:46.850> we<00:02:46.940> can

00:02:47.080 --> 00:02:47.090 
spacebar click isometric and then we can

00:02:47.090 --> 00:02:52.720 
spacebar click isometric and then we can
do<00:02:47.209> an<00:02:47.300> extruded<00:02:48.489> boss/base<00:02:50.560> out<00:02:51.560> to<00:02:52.040> 15

00:02:52.720 --> 00:02:52.730 
do an extruded boss/base out to 15

00:02:52.730 --> 00:02:59.880 
do an extruded boss/base out to 15
millimeters<00:02:54.370> so<00:02:55.959> 14<00:02:56.959> millimetres<00:02:57.500> not<00:02:57.650> 15

00:02:59.880 --> 00:02:59.890 
millimeters so 14 millimetres not 15

00:02:59.890 --> 00:03:01.990 
millimeters so 14 millimetres not 15
next<00:03:00.890> thing<00:03:01.100> I<00:03:01.130> need<00:03:01.340> to<00:03:01.430> draw<00:03:01.610> on<00:03:01.640> this<00:03:01.850> is

00:03:01.990 --> 00:03:02.000 
next thing I need to draw on this is

00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:06.220 
next thing I need to draw on this is
bottom<00:03:02.600> surface<00:03:03.170> so<00:03:03.820> underneath<00:03:05.230> equivalent

00:03:06.220 --> 00:03:06.230 
bottom surface so underneath equivalent

00:03:06.230 --> 00:03:07.990 
bottom surface so underneath equivalent
to<00:03:06.320> that<00:03:06.410> surface<00:03:06.860> we're<00:03:07.340> going<00:03:07.489> to<00:03:07.580> sketch<00:03:07.850> on

00:03:07.990 --> 00:03:08.000 
to that surface we're going to sketch on

00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:11.800 
to that surface we're going to sketch on
there<00:03:08.239> go<00:03:08.510> to<00:03:08.570> draw<00:03:08.810> circle<00:03:09.430> which<00:03:10.430> is<00:03:10.810> 34

00:03:11.800 --> 00:03:11.810 
there go to draw circle which is 34

00:03:11.810 --> 00:03:17.340 
there go to draw circle which is 34
millimeters<00:03:12.910> in<00:03:13.910> diameter<00:03:15.820> measurement<00:03:16.820> on

00:03:17.340 --> 00:03:17.350 
millimeters in diameter measurement on

00:03:17.350 --> 00:03:22.150 
millimeters in diameter measurement on
34<00:03:20.080> and<00:03:21.080> then<00:03:21.200> we<00:03:21.260> want<00:03:21.410> to<00:03:21.470> do<00:03:21.560> an<00:03:21.650> extruded

00:03:22.150 --> 00:03:22.160 
34 and then we want to do an extruded

00:03:22.160 --> 00:03:31.180 
34 and then we want to do an extruded
cut<00:03:25.209> for<00:03:26.209> 13<00:03:27.049> and<00:03:27.350> not<00:03:27.470> 40<00:03:27.830> millimeters<00:03:30.190> all

00:03:31.180 --> 00:03:31.190 
cut for 13 and not 40 millimeters all

00:03:31.190 --> 00:03:32.620 
cut for 13 and not 40 millimeters all
that<00:03:31.310> does<00:03:31.459> is<00:03:31.489> it<00:03:31.700> cuts<00:03:31.970> out<00:03:32.180> a<00:03:32.209> bit<00:03:32.450> of<00:03:32.540> the

00:03:32.620 --> 00:03:32.630 
that does is it cuts out a bit of the

00:03:32.630 --> 00:03:34.090 
that does is it cuts out a bit of the
seatpost<00:03:32.840> which<00:03:33.260> allows<00:03:33.530> it<00:03:33.709> to<00:03:33.739> go<00:03:33.890> over<00:03:34.010> the

00:03:34.090 --> 00:03:34.100 
seatpost which allows it to go over the

00:03:34.100 --> 00:03:36.520 
seatpost which allows it to go over the
tube<00:03:34.340> and<00:03:34.820> then<00:03:35.090> sit<00:03:35.510> on<00:03:35.780> top<00:03:35.930> of<00:03:35.989> the<00:03:36.170> tube<00:03:36.380> so

00:03:36.520 --> 00:03:36.530 
tube and then sit on top of the tube so

00:03:36.530 --> 00:03:41.170 
tube and then sit on top of the tube so
it<00:03:36.590> doesn't<00:03:36.799> slide<00:03:37.010> too<00:03:37.250> far<00:03:37.489> down<00:03:37.610> it<00:03:39.730> okay<00:03:40.730> so

00:03:41.170 --> 00:03:41.180 
it doesn't slide too far down it okay so

00:03:41.180 --> 00:03:43.210 
it doesn't slide too far down it okay so
there's<00:03:41.540> our<00:03:41.690> seat<00:03:41.930> post<00:03:42.170> clamp<00:03:42.380> starting<00:03:43.130> to

00:03:43.210 --> 00:03:43.220 
there's our seat post clamp starting to

00:03:43.220 --> 00:03:45.190 
there's our seat post clamp starting to
look<00:03:43.310> reasonably<00:03:43.850> good<00:03:44.030> next<00:03:44.870> thing<00:03:44.989> is<00:03:45.079> we
