00:00:05.109 --> 00:00:07.410 
by making some additions to our primary
chords<00:00:05.410> one<00:00:05.649> four<00:00:05.920> and<00:00:06.069> five<00:00:06.310> we<00:00:07.149> get<00:00:07.330> the

00:00:07.410 --> 00:00:07.420 
chords one four and five we get the

00:00:07.420 --> 00:00:09.720 
chords one four and five we get the
option<00:00:07.569> to<00:00:07.750> change<00:00:08.139> the<00:00:08.290> baseline<00:00:08.860> move<00:00:09.429> it<00:00:09.610> to

in<00:00:22.449> this<00:00:23.260> first<00:00:23.470> example<00:00:23.680> we<00:00:24.130> have<00:00:24.160> our<00:00:24.430> three

00:00:24.660 --> 00:00:24.670 
in this first example we have our three

our cords here how the harmony or the
tonal<00:00:55.059> texture<00:00:55.540> becomes<00:00:56.140> richer

00:01:10.470 --> 00:01:13.230 

if<00:01:11.470> we<00:01:11.680> go<00:01:11.800> a<00:01:11.830> step<00:01:11.920> further<00:01:12.430> with<00:01:12.760> our<00:01:12.880> chords

00:01:13.230 --> 00:01:13.240 
if we go a step further with our chords

00:01:13.240 --> 00:01:15.870 
if we go a step further with our chords
and<00:01:13.360> use<00:01:13.510> different<00:01:13.870> inversions<00:01:14.550> not<00:01:15.550> only<00:01:15.760> do

00:01:15.870 --> 00:01:15.880 
and use different inversions not only do

00:01:15.880 --> 00:01:17.969 
and use different inversions not only do
we<00:01:15.970> get<00:01:16.120> the<00:01:16.270> richer<00:01:16.690> harmony<00:01:16.990> of<00:01:17.200> our<00:01:17.409> sixths

00:01:17.969 --> 00:01:17.979 
we get the richer harmony of our sixths

00:01:17.979 --> 00:01:20.940 
we get the richer harmony of our sixths
and<00:01:18.130> sevenths<00:01:18.760> but<00:01:19.659> we<00:01:19.750> also<00:01:19.900> create<00:01:20.350> melody

00:01:20.940 --> 00:01:20.950 
and sevenths but we also create melody

00:01:20.950 --> 00:01:37.200 
and sevenths but we also create melody
at<00:01:21.190> the<00:01:21.520> top<00:01:21.729> of<00:01:21.850> the<00:01:21.940> chords

00:01:42.319 --> 00:01:46.419 
has remained the same but our three new
chords<00:01:42.740> have<00:01:43.069> given<00:01:43.369> us<00:01:43.490> three<00:01:43.880> new<00:01:44.299> notes<00:01:45.429> C

00:01:46.419 --> 00:01:46.429

and<00:01:55.680> g7<00:01:57.420> gives<00:01:58.420> F<00:02:01.830> by<00:02:02.830> adding<00:02:03.220> those<00:02:03.430> three

00:02:03.810 --> 00:02:03.820 
and g7 gives F by adding those three

00:02:06.510 --> 00:02:06.520 
notes of BDNF to our baseline at the

00:02:06.520 --> 00:02:09.300 
notes of BDNF to our baseline at the
point<00:02:06.790> where<00:02:07.030> the<00:02:07.150> new<00:02:07.360> chords<00:02:07.780> occur<00:02:08.110> we<00:02:09.100> get

00:02:09.300 --> 00:02:09.310 
point where the new chords occur we get

00:02:09.310 --> 00:02:12.680 
point where the new chords occur we get
more<00:02:09.610> texture<00:02:10.330> and<00:02:10.450> harmony<00:02:11.410> to<00:02:12.040> our<00:02:12.070> baseline

00:02:12.680 --> 00:02:12.690 
more texture and harmony to our baseline

00:02:12.690 --> 00:02:15.360 
more texture and harmony to our baseline
along<00:02:13.690> with<00:02:13.870> more<00:02:14.050> movement<00:02:14.680> throughout<00:02:15.160> the

piece

00:02:29.339 --> 00:02:29.349 

00:02:29.349 --> 00:02:32.380 

remember<00:02:30.349> that<00:02:30.530> in<00:02:30.650> moving<00:02:31.040> the<00:02:31.130> baseline<00:02:31.670> we

00:02:32.380 --> 00:02:32.390 
remember that in moving the baseline we

00:02:32.390 --> 00:02:34.870 
remember that in moving the baseline we
also<00:02:32.569> have<00:02:33.050> the<00:02:33.200> options<00:02:33.590> to<00:02:34.160> harmonize<00:02:34.610> with

00:02:34.870 --> 00:02:34.880 
also have the options to harmonize with

00:02:34.880 --> 00:02:37.770 
also have the options to harmonize with
a<00:02:34.940> third<00:02:35.330> note<00:02:35.569> in<00:02:35.750> the<00:02:35.840> major<00:02:35.989> scale<00:02:36.250> so<00:02:37.250> for<00:02:37.459> C

00:02:37.770 --> 00:02:37.780 
a third note in the major scale so for C

00:02:37.780 --> 00:02:40.260 
a third note in the major scale so for C
its<00:02:38.780> E

00:02:40.260 --> 00:02:40.270 
its E

00:02:40.270 --> 00:02:44.400 
its E
for<00:02:41.080> F<00:02:41.970> it's<00:02:42.970> a

00:02:44.400 --> 00:02:44.410 
for F it's a

00:02:44.410 --> 00:02:48.980 
for F it's a

few of these extra notes of EI and B
along<00:02:56.020> with<00:02:56.230> what<00:02:56.410> we've<00:02:56.560> created<00:02:56.710> so<00:02:57.280> far<00:02:57.420> to

along with what we've created so far to
give<00:02:58.600> us<00:02:58.720> this<00:02:58.900> last<00:02:59.370> variation<00:03:00.370> of<00:03:00.520> our<00:03:01.090> four

00:03:01.410 --> 00:03:01.420 
give us this last variation of our four

00:03:01.420 --> 00:03:15.330 
give us this last variation of our four
bar<00:03:01.630> piece

00:03:15.330 --> 00:03:15.340 

00:03:15.340 --> 00:03:18.309 

when<00:03:16.340> we<00:03:16.430> use<00:03:16.610> bass<00:03:16.970> harmony<00:03:17.569> with<00:03:17.989> chord

00:03:18.319 --> 00:03:21.280 
when we use bass harmony with chord
inversions<00:03:18.950> we<00:03:19.730> create<00:03:20.120> a<00:03:20.299> more<00:03:20.599> melodic<00:03:20.930> and

00:03:21.280 --> 00:03:21.290 
inversions we create a more melodic and

00:03:21.290 --> 00:03:24.940 
inversions we create a more melodic and
directional<00:03:21.920> musical<00:03:22.430> composition<00:03:23.530> here<00:03:24.530> the
