different ways you can use it it's

00:01:00.590 --> 00:01:01.900 
different ways you can use it it's
almost<00:01:00.710> like<00:01:00.920> it's<00:01:01.040> a<00:01:01.100> crafting<00:01:01.460> skill<00:01:01.700> and

almost like it's a crafting skill and

00:01:01.910 --> 00:01:03.250 
almost like it's a crafting skill and
that<00:01:02.060> you<00:01:02.120> can<00:01:02.300> you<00:01:02.540> find<00:01:02.840> things<00:01:02.989> all<00:01:03.230> over

00:01:03.250 --> 00:01:03.260 
that you can you find things all over

00:01:03.260 --> 00:01:04.630 
that you can you find things all over
the<00:01:03.500> world<00:01:03.680> and<00:01:03.920> you<00:01:03.950> can<00:01:04.100> make<00:01:04.250> things<00:01:04.460> like

00:01:04.630 --> 00:01:04.640 
the world and you can make things like

00:01:04.640 --> 00:01:06.310 
the world and you can make things like
healing<00:01:04.850> powder<00:01:05.150> and<00:01:05.479> things<00:01:06.110> to<00:01:06.170> take<00:01:06.290> away

00:01:06.310 --> 00:01:06.320 
healing powder and things to take away

00:01:06.320 --> 00:01:07.660 
healing powder and things to take away
radiation<00:01:06.890> and<00:01:06.979> all<00:01:07.040> this<00:01:07.130> kind<00:01:07.310> of<00:01:07.340> stuff<00:01:07.400> and

00:01:07.660 --> 00:01:07.670 
radiation and all this kind of stuff and

00:01:07.670 --> 00:01:08.530 
radiation and all this kind of stuff and
so<00:01:07.790> it<00:01:07.880> kind<00:01:08.030> of<00:01:08.060> creates<00:01:08.300> a<00:01:08.360> whole<00:01:08.510> new

00:01:08.530 --> 00:01:08.540 
so it kind of creates a whole new

00:01:08.540 --> 00:01:10.810 
so it kind of creates a whole new
crafting<00:01:09.140> thing<00:01:09.350> also<00:01:10.040> it's<00:01:10.400> something<00:01:10.520> that

00:01:10.810 --> 00:01:10.820 
crafting thing also it's something that

00:01:10.820 --> 00:01:12.130 
crafting thing also it's something that
because<00:01:11.030> we<00:01:11.120> have<00:01:11.210> a<00:01:11.240> new<00:01:11.360> hardcore<00:01:11.780> mode<00:01:11.990> in

00:01:12.130 --> 00:01:12.140 
because we have a new hardcore mode in

00:01:12.140 --> 00:01:14.380 
because we have a new hardcore mode in
as<00:01:12.290> well<00:01:12.500> which<00:01:13.070> we're<00:01:13.340> actually<00:01:13.610> dehydration

00:01:14.380 --> 00:01:14.390 
as well which we're actually dehydration

00:01:14.390 --> 00:01:16.150 
as well which we're actually dehydration
matters<00:01:14.750> and<00:01:14.990> how<00:01:15.170> hungry<00:01:15.530> you<00:01:15.590> are<00:01:15.680> matters

00:01:18.700 --> 00:01:18.710 
and and sim packs take time to actually

00:01:18.710 --> 00:01:19.900 
and and sim packs take time to actually
heal<00:01:18.860> you<00:01:19.040> they<00:01:19.160> don't<00:01:19.310> have<00:01:19.490> been<00:01:19.580> instantly

and so kind of all tweaks and on top of

00:01:21.740 --> 00:01:23.800 
and so kind of all tweaks and on top of
that<00:01:21.860> survival<00:01:22.460> effects<00:01:22.880> even<00:01:23.270> at<00:01:23.600> the

00:01:23.800 --> 00:01:23.810 
that survival effects even at the

00:01:23.810 --> 00:01:25.960 
that survival effects even at the
hardcore<00:01:24.200> mode<00:01:24.380> by<00:01:24.619> it<00:01:25.040> taking<00:01:25.460> kind<00:01:25.759> of<00:01:25.790> like

00:01:25.960 --> 00:01:25.970 
hardcore mode by it taking kind of like

00:01:25.970 --> 00:01:28.090 
hardcore mode by it taking kind of like
if<00:01:26.479> the<00:01:26.750> more<00:01:26.990> you<00:01:27.259> have<00:01:27.440> a<00:01:27.470> how<00:01:27.770> you<00:01:27.830> have<00:01:28.009> in

00:01:28.100 --> 00:01:30.520 
if the more you have a how you have in
survival<00:01:28.630> the<00:01:29.630> more<00:01:29.810> your<00:01:29.990> food<00:01:30.200> you<00:01:30.350> more

00:01:30.520 --> 00:01:30.530 
survival the more your food you more

00:01:30.530 --> 00:01:32.020 
survival the more your food you more
like<00:01:30.740> you<00:01:30.890> get<00:01:31.040> from<00:01:31.220> the<00:01:31.310> food<00:01:31.490> you<00:01:31.520> eat<00:01:31.670> and

00:01:32.020 --> 00:01:32.030 
like you get from the food you eat and

00:01:32.030 --> 00:01:33.430 
like you get from the food you eat and
also<00:01:32.660> you<00:01:32.840> don't<00:01:32.960> get<00:01:33.020> as<00:01:33.140> much<00:01:33.259> radiation

00:01:33.430 --> 00:01:33.440 
also you don't get as much radiation

00:01:33.440 --> 00:01:35.920 
also you don't get as much radiation
from<00:01:34.040> actually<00:01:34.310> eating<00:01:34.520> the<00:01:34.550> food<00:01:34.759> is<00:01:35.420> so<00:01:35.720> kind

00:01:35.920 --> 00:01:35.930 
from actually eating the food is so kind

00:01:35.930 --> 00:01:36.850 
from actually eating the food is so kind
of<00:01:35.960> that's<00:01:36.140> how<00:01:36.200> we<00:01:36.290> kind<00:01:36.440> of<00:01:36.470> played<00:01:36.649> with<00:01:36.680> the

00:01:36.850 --> 00:01:36.860 
of that's how we kind of played with the

00:01:36.860 --> 00:01:38.469 
of that's how we kind of played with the
skills<00:01:37.130> we<00:01:37.550> put<00:01:37.729> in<00:01:37.820> traits<00:01:38.090> like<00:01:38.270> you<00:01:38.390> were

00:01:38.469 --> 00:01:38.479 
skills we put in traits like you were

00:01:38.479 --> 00:01:40.030 
skills we put in traits like you were
saying<00:01:38.720> and<00:01:38.869> there's<00:01:39.259> a<00:01:39.320> trait<00:01:39.590> that<00:01:39.619> actually

00:01:40.030 --> 00:01:40.040 
saying and there's a trait that actually

00:01:40.040 --> 00:01:42.010 
saying and there's a trait that actually
is<00:01:40.160> sort<00:01:40.340> of<00:01:40.399> this<00:01:40.490> crazy<00:01:40.670> trait<00:01:41.210> where<00:01:41.420> weird

00:01:42.010 --> 00:01:42.020 
is sort of this crazy trait where weird

00:01:42.020 --> 00:01:44.200 
is sort of this crazy trait where weird
things<00:01:42.080> happen<00:01:42.710> in<00:01:43.040> the<00:01:43.430> wasteland<00:01:43.820> the

00:01:44.200 --> 00:01:44.210 
things happen in the wasteland the

00:01:44.210 --> 00:01:45.550 
things happen in the wasteland the
strange<00:01:44.509> things<00:01:44.780> occur<00:01:45.080> with<00:01:45.259> something<00:01:45.470> we

00:01:45.550 --> 00:01:45.560 
strange things occur with something we

00:01:45.560 --> 00:01:46.960 
strange things occur with something we
get<00:01:45.649> back<00:01:45.890> and<00:01:46.070> follow<00:01:46.250> on<00:01:46.460> and<00:01:46.610> follow<00:01:46.759> it<00:01:46.820> too

00:01:46.960 --> 00:01:46.970 
get back and follow on and follow it too

00:01:46.970 --> 00:01:48.639 
get back and follow on and follow it too
you'd<00:01:47.149> have<00:01:47.330> these<00:01:47.450> random<00:01:48.020> encounters<00:01:48.530> are

00:01:48.639 --> 00:01:48.649 
you'd have these random encounters are

00:01:48.649 --> 00:01:49.930 
you'd have these random encounters are
just<00:01:48.800> kind<00:01:48.979> of<00:01:49.070> strange<00:01:49.340> things<00:01:49.670> would<00:01:49.820> happen

00:01:49.930 --> 00:01:49.940 
just kind of strange things would happen

00:01:49.940 --> 00:01:51.370 
just kind of strange things would happen
sometimes<00:01:50.720> we<00:01:50.810> took<00:01:50.930> it<00:01:51.049> a<00:01:51.080> little<00:01:51.110> too<00:01:51.350> far

00:01:51.370 --> 00:01:51.380 
sometimes we took it a little too far

00:01:51.380 --> 00:01:53.469 
sometimes we took it a little too far
we'd<00:01:51.830> have<00:01:51.920> Monty<00:01:52.190> Python<00:01:52.549> references<00:01:53.090> and<00:01:53.330> I

00:01:53.469 --> 00:01:53.479 
we'd have Monty Python references and I

00:01:53.479 --> 00:01:54.870 
we'd have Monty Python references and I
think<00:01:53.750> we<00:01:53.840> had<00:01:53.930> a<00:01:53.960> start<00:01:54.229> way<00:01:54.380> to<00:01:54.440> Star<00:01:54.740> Trek

00:01:54.870 --> 00:01:54.880 
think we had a start way to Star Trek

00:01:54.880 --> 00:01:58.090 
think we had a start way to Star Trek
Star<00:01:55.880> Trek<00:01:56.090> Shuttle<00:01:56.420> crash<00:01:56.570> and<00:01:57.020> they're<00:01:58.010> not

00:01:58.090 --> 00:01:58.100 
Star Trek Shuttle crash and they're not

00:01:58.100 --> 00:02:00.100 
Star Trek Shuttle crash and they're not
that<00:01:58.280> crazy<00:01:58.580> but<00:01:59.090> just<00:01:59.240> kind<00:01:59.360> of<00:01:59.420> kind<00:01:59.900> of<00:01:59.960> add

00:02:00.100 --> 00:02:00.110 
that crazy but just kind of kind of add

00:02:00.110 --> 00:02:02.870 
that crazy but just kind of kind of add
something<00:02:00.440> to<00:02:00.680> it

00:02:02.870 --> 00:02:02.880 

00:02:02.880 --> 00:02:05.490 

one<00:02:03.880> of<00:02:03.970> things<00:02:04.090> we've<00:02:04.270> really<00:02:04.870> focused<00:02:05.170> on<00:02:05.440> a

00:02:05.490 --> 00:02:05.500 
one of things we've really focused on a

00:02:05.500 --> 00:02:08.160 
one of things we've really focused on a
lot<00:02:05.560> is<00:02:05.830> with<00:02:06.280> weapons<00:02:06.610> is<00:02:06.850> to<00:02:07.390> really<00:02:07.570> kind<00:02:08.050> of

00:02:08.160 --> 00:02:08.170 
lot is with weapons is to really kind of

00:02:08.170 --> 00:02:09.719 
lot is with weapons is to really kind of
tear<00:02:08.649> up<00:02:08.770> the<00:02:08.890> weapons<00:02:09.190> and<00:02:09.310> make<00:02:09.430> sure<00:02:09.610> that

tear up the weapons and make sure that

00:02:09.729 --> 00:02:11.430 
tear up the weapons and make sure that
every<00:02:10.000> tear<00:02:10.330> of<00:02:10.570> the<00:02:10.780> weapons<00:02:11.110> like<00:02:11.230> when<00:02:11.320> your

00:02:11.430 --> 00:02:11.440 
every tear of the weapons like when your

00:02:11.440 --> 00:02:12.720 
every tear of the weapons like when your
being<00:02:11.590> in<00:02:11.680> a<00:02:11.890> game<00:02:12.070> you're<00:02:12.280> a<00:02:12.340> little<00:02:12.490> bit<00:02:12.580> into

00:02:12.720 --> 00:02:12.730 
being in a game you're a little bit into

00:02:12.730 --> 00:02:13.800 
being in a game you're a little bit into
the<00:02:12.790> game<00:02:12.940> you're<00:02:13.120> farther<00:02:13.390> into<00:02:13.510> the<00:02:13.660> game

pistol and put a scope on it you can

00:02:26.380 --> 00:02:27.870 
pistol and put a scope on it you can
give<00:02:26.530> it<00:02:26.680> a<00:02:26.860> you<00:02:27.250> know<00:02:27.310> give<00:02:27.460> it<00:02:27.580> you<00:02:27.700> can<00:02:27.730> give

00:02:27.870 --> 00:02:27.880 
give it a you know give it you can give

00:02:27.880 --> 00:02:29.130 
give it a you know give it you can give
it<00:02:27.910> a<00:02:28.030> few<00:02:28.060> things<00:02:28.450> of<00:02:28.600> being<00:02:28.810> a<00:02:28.840> bit<00:02:28.960> a<00:02:28.990> bigger

00:02:29.130 --> 00:02:29.140 
it a few things of being a bit a bigger

00:02:29.140 --> 00:02:31.440 
it a few things of being a bit a bigger
clip<00:02:29.470> you<00:02:29.920> can<00:02:30.190> put<00:02:30.610> a<00:02:30.640> silencer<00:02:30.850> on<00:02:31.240> it<00:02:31.300> you

00:02:31.440 --> 00:02:31.450 
clip you can put a silencer on it you

00:02:31.450 --> 00:02:32.850 
clip you can put a silencer on it you
can<00:02:31.600> make<00:02:31.630> it<00:02:31.780> more<00:02:31.900> accurate<00:02:32.080> all<00:02:32.620> these

00:02:32.850 --> 00:02:32.860 
can make it more accurate all these

00:02:32.860 --> 00:02:33.930 
can make it more accurate all these
things<00:02:33.100> so<00:02:33.220> it's<00:02:33.310> a<00:02:33.370> lot<00:02:33.460> of<00:02:33.490> times<00:02:33.730> you<00:02:33.820> can

00:02:33.930 --> 00:02:33.940 
things so it's a lot of times you can

00:02:33.940 --> 00:02:35.160 
things so it's a lot of times you can
you<00:02:34.120> there's<00:02:34.270> this<00:02:34.390> weapon<00:02:34.750> that<00:02:34.870> you<00:02:34.959> really

like<00:02:35.410> you<00:02:35.980> can<00:02:36.010> keep<00:02:36.430> it<00:02:36.700> for<00:02:37.480> a<00:02:37.510> longer<00:02:37.810> period

00:02:37.860 --> 00:02:37.870 
like you can keep it for a longer period

00:02:37.870 --> 00:02:40.199 
like you can keep it for a longer period
of<00:02:38.080> time<00:02:38.170> by<00:02:38.830> putting<00:02:39.010> weapon<00:02:39.340> mods<00:02:39.490> on<00:02:39.700> it<00:02:39.820> and

of time by putting weapon mods on it and

00:02:40.209 --> 00:02:42.330 
of time by putting weapon mods on it and
and<00:02:40.450> and<00:02:40.750> then<00:02:40.959> even<00:02:41.110> when<00:02:41.230> you<00:02:41.350> repair<00:02:41.770> you

00:02:49.630 --> 00:02:49.640 

00:02:49.640 --> 00:02:52.840 

we<00:02:50.420> wanted<00:02:50.690> to<00:02:51.220> approach<00:02:52.220> it<00:02:52.490> a<00:02:52.550> little<00:02:52.700> bit

00:02:52.840 --> 00:02:52.850 
we wanted to approach it a little bit

00:02:52.850 --> 00:02:54.040 
we wanted to approach it a little bit
differently<00:02:53.180> you<00:02:53.330> know<00:02:53.360> and<00:02:53.630> what<00:02:53.780> we<00:02:53.810> have

00:02:54.040 --> 00:02:54.050 
differently you know and what we have

00:02:54.050 --> 00:02:55.540 
differently you know and what we have
now<00:02:54.260> is<00:02:54.470> we<00:02:54.620> have<00:02:54.650> skill<00:02:54.950> magazines<00:02:55.370> where

00:02:55.540 --> 00:02:55.550 
now is we have skill magazines where

00:02:55.550 --> 00:02:56.860 
now is we have skill magazines where
different<00:02:56.000> between<00:02:56.180> the<00:02:56.360> skill<00:02:56.540> books<00:02:56.750> and

00:02:56.860 --> 00:02:56.870 
different between the skill books and

00:02:56.870 --> 00:02:58.510 
different between the skill books and
the<00:02:56.930> skill<00:02:57.110> magazines<00:02:57.620> are<00:02:58.040> things<00:02:58.310> that<00:02:58.430> have

00:02:58.510 --> 00:02:58.520 
the skill magazines are things that have

00:02:58.520 --> 00:03:00.250 
the skill magazines are things that have
given<00:02:58.700> you<00:02:58.820> temporary<00:02:59.240> bonuses<00:02:59.660> so<00:03:00.080> it's<00:03:00.200> now

00:03:00.250 --> 00:03:00.260 
given you temporary bonuses so it's now

00:03:00.260 --> 00:03:01.570 
given you temporary bonuses so it's now
a<00:03:00.290> little<00:03:00.380> bit<00:03:00.650> harder<00:03:00.920> to<00:03:00.950> find<00:03:01.250> the<00:03:01.400> skill

00:03:01.570 --> 00:03:01.580 
a little bit harder to find the skill

00:03:01.580 --> 00:03:02.620 
a little bit harder to find the skill
books<00:03:01.760> in<00:03:01.880> the<00:03:01.970> in<00:03:02.090> the<00:03:02.210> world<00:03:02.360> but<00:03:02.570> you

00:03:02.620 --> 00:03:02.630 
books in the in the world but you

00:03:02.630 --> 00:03:03.940 
books in the in the world but you
actually<00:03:02.750> get<00:03:02.930> more<00:03:03.170> of<00:03:03.230> a<00:03:03.320> bonus<00:03:03.470> when<00:03:03.740> you<00:03:03.800> do

00:03:03.940 --> 00:03:03.950 
actually get more of a bonus when you do

00:03:03.950 --> 00:03:05.590 
actually get more of a bonus when you do
find<00:03:04.190> them<00:03:04.310> and<00:03:04.520> so<00:03:04.940> this<00:03:05.090> is<00:03:05.240> kind<00:03:05.390> of<00:03:05.450> also

00:03:05.590 --> 00:03:05.600 
find them and so this is kind of also

00:03:42.120 --> 00:03:44.300 

so<00:03:43.050> if<00:03:43.140> there's<00:03:43.319> anything<00:03:43.620> that<00:03:43.830> I<00:03:43.860> would<00:03:44.069> that

00:03:44.300 --> 00:03:44.310 
so if there's anything that I would that

00:03:44.310 --> 00:03:45.740 
so if there's anything that I would that
I<00:03:44.340> would<00:03:44.519> say<00:03:44.670> was<00:03:44.849> something<00:03:45.120> we<00:03:45.239> kind<00:03:45.599> of

00:03:45.740 --> 00:03:45.750 
I would say was something we kind of

00:03:45.750 --> 00:03:47.930 
I would say was something we kind of
worked<00:03:45.900> on<00:03:46.050> in<00:03:46.379> Fallout<00:03:46.769> New<00:03:46.800> Vegas<00:03:46.890> that<00:03:47.790> was

00:03:47.930 --> 00:03:47.940 
worked on in Fallout New Vegas that was

00:03:47.940 --> 00:03:49.820 
worked on in Fallout New Vegas that was
sort<00:03:48.120> of<00:03:48.150> adding<00:03:48.930> more<00:03:48.959> or<00:03:49.379> changing<00:03:49.739> a<00:03:49.769> little

00:03:49.820 --> 00:03:49.830 
sort of adding more or changing a little

00:03:49.830 --> 00:03:51.619 
sort of adding more or changing a little
bit<00:03:49.950> about<00:03:50.160> fallout<00:03:50.459> 3<00:03:50.640> it<00:03:51.000> was<00:03:51.120> really<00:03:51.330> adding

00:03:51.619 --> 00:03:51.629 
bit about fallout 3 it was really adding

00:03:51.629 --> 00:03:53.509 
bit about fallout 3 it was really adding
in<00:03:51.720> more<00:03:51.870> quests<00:03:52.110> so<00:03:53.010> I<00:03:53.069> think<00:03:53.160> it<00:03:53.310> followed

00:03:53.509 --> 00:03:53.519 
in more quests so I think it followed

00:03:53.519 --> 00:03:54.530 
in more quests so I think it followed
three<00:03:53.670> there<00:03:53.790> was<00:03:53.910> a<00:03:53.970> good<00:03:54.060> number<00:03:54.239> of<00:03:54.390> press

00:03:54.530 --> 00:03:54.540 
three there was a good number of press

00:03:54.540 --> 00:03:55.759 
three there was a good number of press
and<00:03:54.569> there's<00:03:54.870> always<00:03:54.959> the<00:03:55.140> main<00:03:55.290> storyline

00:03:55.759 --> 00:03:55.769 
and there's always the main storyline

00:03:55.769 --> 00:03:57.320 
and there's always the main storyline
and<00:03:55.890> things<00:03:56.069> like<00:03:56.220> that<00:03:56.280> but<00:03:56.910> a<00:03:56.940> lot<00:03:57.090> of<00:03:57.239> what

00:03:57.320 --> 00:03:57.330 
and things like that but a lot of what

00:03:57.330 --> 00:03:58.789 
and things like that but a lot of what
you<00:03:57.420> were<00:03:57.510> doing<00:03:57.540> which<00:03:57.959> is<00:03:57.989> a<00:03:58.170> great<00:03:58.500> wishes

00:03:58.789 --> 00:03:58.799

you were doing which is a great wishes
great<00:03:58.980> gameplay<00:03:59.190> is<00:03:59.580> just<00:03:59.610> kind<00:03:59.940> of<00:03:59.970> finding

00:04:00.289 --> 00:04:00.299 
great gameplay is just kind of finding
