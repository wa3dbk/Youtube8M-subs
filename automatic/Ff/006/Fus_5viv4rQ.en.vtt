left ear because I figure if I'm driving

00:00:22.150 --> 00:00:25.140 
left ear because I figure if I'm driving
I<00:00:22.859> be<00:00:23.859> able<00:00:24.039> to<00:00:24.099> hear<00:00:24.220> my<00:00:24.369> passengers<00:00:24.910> better

if<00:00:25.390> my<00:00:25.419> right<00:00:25.869> ear<00:00:25.900> didn't<00:00:26.380> have<00:00:26.499> this<00:00:26.679> big

00:00:26.909 --> 00:00:26.919 
if my right ear didn't have this big

blue<00:00:27.099> tooth<00:00:27.310> in<00:00:27.490> it<00:00:27.810> so<00:00:28.810> why<00:00:29.470> bose<00:00:29.769> chose<00:00:30.249> to

00:00:30.599 --> 00:00:30.609 
blue tooth in it so why bose chose to

00:00:30.609 --> 00:00:34.200 
blue tooth in it so why bose chose to
make<00:00:30.820> a<00:00:31.749> left<00:00:32.619> ear<00:00:32.920> and<00:00:32.950> a<00:00:33.220> right<00:00:33.460> ear<00:00:33.760> instead

00:00:34.200 --> 00:00:34.210 
make a left ear and a right ear instead

00:00:34.210 --> 00:00:37.830 
make a left ear and a right ear instead
of<00:00:34.329> making<00:00:34.690> it<00:00:34.870> universal<00:00:35.680> I<00:00:35.770> have<00:00:35.920> no<00:00:36.070> idea<00:00:36.840> it

00:00:37.830 --> 00:00:37.840 
of making it universal I have no idea it

00:00:37.840 --> 00:00:39.510 
of making it universal I have no idea it
is<00:00:38.050> the<00:00:38.440> first<00:00:38.649> time<00:00:38.770> I've<00:00:38.920> ever<00:00:38.949> heard<00:00:39.280> of<00:00:39.370> it

00:00:39.510 --> 00:00:39.520 
is the first time I've ever heard of it

00:00:39.520 --> 00:00:41.220 
is the first time I've ever heard of it
but<00:00:39.699> they<00:00:40.300> must<00:00:40.570> have<00:00:40.750> some<00:00:40.989> kind<00:00:41.140> of

00:00:41.220 --> 00:00:41.230 
but they must have some kind of

00:00:41.230 --> 00:00:43.740 
but they must have some kind of
reasoning<00:00:41.649> behind<00:00:41.739> it<00:00:42.359> may<00:00:43.359> be<00:00:43.420> playing

00:00:43.740 --> 00:00:43.750 
reasoning behind it may be playing

00:00:43.750 --> 00:00:46.439 
reasoning behind it may be playing
around<00:00:43.930> with<00:00:44.260> it<00:00:44.320> I<00:00:44.680> can<00:00:45.100> set<00:00:45.699> it<00:00:45.850> to<00:00:46.030> the<00:00:46.300> right

00:00:46.439 --> 00:00:46.449 
around with it I can set it to the right

00:00:46.449 --> 00:00:50.759 
around with it I can set it to the right
ear<00:00:46.809> but<00:00:47.410> I<00:00:47.800> won't<00:00:48.219> know<00:00:48.340> until<00:00:48.640> I've<00:00:49.510> had<00:00:50.410> it

00:01:42.749 --> 00:01:42.759 
right so what else has come with this is

00:01:42.759 --> 00:01:46.249 
right so what else has come with this is
probably<00:01:43.149> the<00:01:43.420> USB<00:01:43.929> charger<00:01:44.520> yes<00:01:45.520> it<00:01:45.700> is

00:01:46.249 --> 00:01:46.259 
probably the USB charger yes it is

00:01:46.259 --> 00:01:50.100 
probably the USB charger yes it is
actually<00:01:47.259> I'm<00:01:47.909> pretty<00:01:48.909> impressed<00:01:49.539> with<00:01:49.869> this

00:01:50.100 --> 00:01:50.110 
actually I'm pretty impressed with this

00:01:50.110 --> 00:01:54.840 
actually I'm pretty impressed with this
pretty<00:01:51.070> thin<00:01:51.399> there's<00:01:52.270> a<00:01:52.390> USB<00:01:53.100> this<00:01:54.100> folds<00:01:54.670> and

00:01:54.840 --> 00:01:54.850 
pretty thin there's a USB this folds and

00:01:54.850 --> 00:01:56.880 
pretty thin there's a USB this folds and
it<00:01:55.149> looks<00:01:55.360> a<00:01:55.569> bit<00:01:55.810> different<00:01:55.869> than<00:01:56.590> what<00:01:56.770> I'm

00:01:56.880 --> 00:01:56.890 
it looks a bit different than what I'm

00:01:56.890 --> 00:02:00.600 
it looks a bit different than what I'm
used<00:01:57.159> to<00:01:57.640> seeing<00:01:58.830> it's<00:01:59.830> because<00:02:00.220> they're<00:02:00.429> both

00:02:00.600 --> 00:02:00.610 
used to seeing it's because they're both

00:02:00.610 --> 00:02:02.730 
used to seeing it's because they're both
separated<00:02:01.240> I<00:02:01.450> don't<00:02:02.020> know<00:02:02.140> if<00:02:02.229> you<00:02:02.319> could<00:02:02.470> see

00:02:02.730 --> 00:02:02.740 
separated I don't know if you could see

00:02:02.740 --> 00:02:05.820 
separated I don't know if you could see
that<00:02:03.360> but<00:02:04.360> as<00:02:04.539> you<00:02:05.110> can<00:02:05.229> see<00:02:05.409> they're<00:02:05.619> both

00:02:05.820 --> 00:02:05.830 
that but as you can see they're both

00:02:05.830 --> 00:02:07.590 
that but as you can see they're both
separate<00:02:06.280> so<00:02:06.429> when<00:02:06.580> it's<00:02:06.729> inside<00:02:07.179> it's

00:02:07.590 --> 00:02:07.600 
separate so when it's inside it's

00:02:07.600 --> 00:02:10.559 
separate so when it's inside it's
actually<00:02:08.080> thinner<00:02:08.950> than<00:02:09.220> normal<00:02:09.819> and<00:02:09.970> then

00:02:10.559 --> 00:02:10.569 
actually thinner than normal and then

00:02:10.569 --> 00:02:15.830 
actually thinner than normal and then
pops<00:02:11.500> out<00:02:11.739> to<00:02:11.890> that<00:02:12.120> it<00:02:13.120> looks<00:02:13.450> like<00:02:14.400> this

00:02:15.830 --> 00:02:15.840 
pops out to that it looks like this

00:02:15.840 --> 00:02:17.940 
pops out to that it looks like this
detaches<00:02:16.840> something<00:02:17.290> but<00:02:17.470> i'll<00:02:17.590> have<00:02:17.709> to<00:02:17.829> look

00:02:17.940 --> 00:02:17.950 
detaches something but i'll have to look

00:02:17.950 --> 00:02:20.630 
detaches something but i'll have to look
more<00:02:18.190> into<00:02:18.250> that<00:02:18.519> later<00:02:18.670> maybe<00:02:19.450> it's<00:02:19.720> a

00:02:20.630 --> 00:02:20.640 
more into that later maybe it's a

00:02:20.640 --> 00:02:23.759 
more into that later maybe it's a
supposed<00:02:21.640> to<00:02:21.760> be<00:02:21.959> when<00:02:22.959> you're<00:02:23.140> pulling<00:02:23.500> this

00:02:23.759 --> 00:02:23.769

00:02:23.769 --> 00:02:30.240 
supposed to be when you're pulling this
