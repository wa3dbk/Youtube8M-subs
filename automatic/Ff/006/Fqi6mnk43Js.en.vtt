00:00:00.110 --> 00:00:04.370
 what color do you prefer for a 

00:00:01.610 --> 00:00:06.960
 race that actually does it depends 

00:00:04.370 --> 00:00:08.310
 really more races 

00:00:06.960 --> 00:00:10.280
 on 1 50 m it is not very important 

00:00:08.310 --> 00:00:12.360
 because here it is a little easy 

00:00:10.280 --> 00:00:14.340
 when one is in the middle in usually 

00:00:12.360 --> 00:00:15.750
 swimmers go faster but on a 

00:00:14.340 --> 00:00:18.390
 50 meters completely safe there is no 

00:00:15.750 --> 00:00:21.330
 really affect employment then 

00:00:18.390 --> 00:00:25.500
 I prefer the one before going home 

00:00:21.330 --> 00:00:27.180
 on the basin at death my 

00:00:25.500 --> 00:00:29.640
 favorite color is in the shower 

00:00:27.180 --> 00:00:31.560
 last night the blow there we'll say between 

00:00:29.640 --> 00:00:34.079
 the A4 is often mine because 

00:00:31.560 --> 00:00:36.320
 that we have peripheral vision rather 

00:00:34.079 --> 00:00:38.880
 friendly can cut to compare to the 

00:00:36.320 --> 00:00:42.719
 life all really people who are at 

00:00:38.880 --> 00:00:45.120
 the other us but when he when he needs to 

00:00:42.719 --> 00:00:46.410
 really old and that's of course the 

00:00:45.120 --> 00:00:48.059
 line 1 or line 8 when I'm in 

00:00:46.410 --> 00:00:49.890
 final because there we are hidden the 

00:00:48.059 --> 00:00:51.170
 opponents do not see and we can 

00:00:49.890 --> 00:00:53.309
 arise at the last moment 

00:00:51.170 --> 00:00:55.260
 you get to see the others 

00:00:53.309 --> 00:00:56.280
 competitors during the race I do not see 

00:00:55.260 --> 00:00:58.379
 not too much I actually saw so badly 

00:00:56.280 --> 00:01:00.210
 in the urn is that I have trouble ay is 

00:00:58.379 --> 00:01:01.440
 ready to look right to left 

00:01:00.210 --> 00:01:03.780
 it must be said that it is not bad experience 

00:01:01.440 --> 00:01:05.220
 mohcine to brew and an ax that you 

00:01:03.780 --> 00:01:07.620
 look ahead so we get to them 

00:01:05.220 --> 00:01:09.000
 guess on the side and if I see them c 

00:01:07.620 --> 00:01:12.300
 bad sign so I try not to 

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:14.180
 to see them again it depends 

00:01:12.300 --> 00:01:16.170
 really from the distance ago 

00:01:14.180 --> 00:01:18.210
 the longer the distance is, the more 

00:01:16.170 --> 00:01:18.950
 can afford to look next etc 

00:01:18.210 --> 00:01:20.600
 we are 

00:01:18.950 --> 00:01:23.119
 past compared to others I do not 

00:01:20.600 --> 00:01:27.530
 415 style events without you 

00:01:23.119 --> 00:01:29.990
 tire a little over 50 meters that's it 

00:01:27.530 --> 00:01:31.640
 happens very very quickly we try 

00:01:29.990 --> 00:01:36.679
 precisely no passion and no other 

00:01:31.640 --> 00:01:38.200
 to refocus on a race as filled 

00:01:36.679 --> 00:01:40.659
 of a race c 

00:01:38.200 --> 00:01:42.090
 and above all the Appeals Chamber the 

00:01:40.659 --> 00:01:42.960
 appeal chamber or 

00:01:42.090 --> 00:01:44.490
 we can 

00:01:42.960 --> 00:01:46.590
 they can see what they are afraid that 

00:01:44.490 --> 00:01:48.420
 are not afraid of trades the steps to 

00:01:46.590 --> 00:01:51.000
 do not miss during the race 

00:01:48.420 --> 00:01:53.400
 not to be missed after all the effects 

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:56.850
 until we worked I do not know there is 

00:01:53.400 --> 00:01:59.250
 so much of a phase in fact 

00:01:56.850 --> 00:02:01.850
 in a 50 m it's hard 20 seconds that he 

00:01:59.250 --> 00:02:03.899
 do not really miss anything I think 

00:02:01.850 --> 00:02:05.580
 to make a very good race but 

00:02:03.899 --> 00:02:07.850
 must we have a good start a 

00:02:05.580 --> 00:02:11.039
 manna sunk there is debate could 

00:02:07.850 --> 00:02:14.250
 to train sadly I then in 

00:02:11.039 --> 00:02:16.500
 the villages pace you have to swim 

00:02:14.250 --> 00:02:26.780
 the biggest the biggest possible good 

00:02:16.500 --> 00:02:29.720
 turn it depends on people it will depend 

00:02:26.780 --> 00:02:32.180
 many did what a head of pain I 

00:02:29.720 --> 00:02:33.290
 gaping a lot and that finally when I 

00:02:32.180 --> 00:02:34.880
 I mean, it's good 

00:02:33.290 --> 00:02:36.350
 that's pretty good sign I'm I 

00:02:34.880 --> 00:02:37.250
 am released I am well and often 

00:02:36.350 --> 00:02:38.660
 I can make others yawn 

00:02:37.250 --> 00:02:39.650
 people and I like it 

00:02:38.660 --> 00:02:41.890
 the impression I threw out 

00:02:39.650 --> 00:02:41.890
 humble 

00:02:44.760 --> 00:02:47.760
 when
