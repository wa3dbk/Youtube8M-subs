00:00:03.390 --> 00:00:05.500
 and the things around us are completely different than 

00:00:05.500 --> 00:00:06.390
 it seems 

00:00:06.390 --> 00:00:09.089
 we think we know the world around us 

00:00:09.089 --> 00:00:11.409
 but actually only see the outside 

00:00:11.409 --> 00:00:13.699
 what is it all about 

00:00:13.699 --> 00:00:15.589
 I was like you 

00:00:15.589 --> 00:00:17.699
 I believed humanity newspaper articles 

00:00:17.699 --> 00:00:20.980
 TV series to politicians and a book on 

00:00:20.980 --> 00:00:22.269
 stories 

00:00:22.269 --> 00:00:24.300
 but the day came when the world gave me 

00:00:24.300 --> 00:00:26.300
 help and I have no other 

00:00:26.300 --> 00:00:27.070
 of choice 

00:00:27.070 --> 00:00:29.529
 except how to see him as he is 

00:00:29.529 --> 00:00:31.630
 I will tell my story only with 

00:00:31.630 --> 00:00:33.210
 ordinary guy happened 

00:00:33.210 --> 00:00:34.940
 incredible surprise 

00:00:34.940 --> 00:00:37.300
 maybe it should happen 

00:00:37.300 --> 00:00:40.450
 maybe it was my father's no matter 

00:00:40.450 --> 00:00:42.280
 but one thing I know for sure 

00:00:42.280 --> 00:00:45.280
 but from now on everything will be different 

00:01:08.810 --> 00:01:12.010

00:01:13.760 --> 00:01:15.260
 parents 

00:01:15.260 --> 00:01:17.210
 after he became a priest we 

00:01:17.210 --> 00:01:18.640
 separated from each other 

00:01:18.640 --> 00:01:20.310
 but still he is the only one to my 

00:01:20.310 --> 00:01:21.530
 the years 

00:01:21.530 --> 00:01:23.450
 the only one who can believe that I am 

00:01:23.450 --> 00:01:26.450
 not guilty of anything 

00:01:28.880 --> 00:01:30.090
 earlier friday

00:01:42.200 --> 00:01:44.780
 the ropes I saw what they were doing but was not in 

00:01:44.780 --> 00:01:47.850

 me and until my death 

00:05:10.089 --> 00:05:13.330
