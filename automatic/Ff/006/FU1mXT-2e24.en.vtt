00:00:59.020 --> 00:00:59.030 
pretty pretty fine I won't say it was

00:00:59.030 --> 00:01:01.270 
pretty pretty fine I won't say it was
easy<00:00:59.270> but<00:00:59.510> it<00:00:59.870> was<00:01:00.079> pretty<00:01:00.290> fine<00:01:00.590> I<00:01:00.620> made<00:01:01.070> some

00:01:03.460 --> 00:01:03.470 
new strategies so I guess I didn't

00:01:03.470 --> 00:01:05.889 
new strategies so I guess I didn't
expect<00:01:03.530> it<00:01:03.920> to<00:01:03.950> face<00:01:04.369> them<00:01:04.670> so<00:01:05.239> I<00:01:05.269> just<00:01:05.600> want<00:01:05.840> to

00:01:21.340 --> 00:01:21.350 
so we actually had found out that grubby

00:01:21.350 --> 00:01:23.469 
so we actually had found out that grubby
and<00:01:21.380> Ciera<00:01:22.069> both<00:01:22.399> were<00:01:22.609> eliminated<00:01:23.359> in

bracket<00:01:23.899> play<00:01:24.109> does<00:01:24.469> that<00:01:24.679> affect<00:01:25.100> how<00:01:25.399> your

00:01:26.139 --> 00:01:26.149 
bracket play does that affect how your

00:01:26.149 --> 00:01:27.249 
bracket play does that affect how your
mindset<00:01:26.539> at<00:01:26.840> all

00:01:27.249 --> 00:01:27.259 
mindset at all

00:01:27.259 --> 00:01:29.949 
mindset at all
well<00:01:28.039> careless<00:01:28.939> to<00:01:29.149> thought<00:01:29.359> I<00:01:29.389> guess<00:01:29.749> it's

00:01:29.949 --> 00:01:29.959 
well careless to thought I guess it's

00:01:29.959 --> 00:01:31.840 
well careless to thought I guess it's
all<00:01:30.139> about<00:01:30.380> balance<00:01:30.889> because<00:01:31.459> thought<00:01:31.670> was

00:01:31.840 --> 00:01:31.850 
all about balance because thought was

00:01:31.850 --> 00:01:35.800 
all about balance because thought was
human<00:01:32.209> and<00:01:32.389> here<00:01:32.990> is<00:01:33.170> or<00:01:33.409> can't<00:01:34.479> maybe<00:01:35.479> toe

00:01:35.800 --> 00:01:35.810 
human and here is or can't maybe toe

00:01:35.810 --> 00:01:37.449 
human and here is or can't maybe toe
just<00:01:36.049> played<00:01:36.259> better<00:01:36.499> I'm<00:01:36.770> not<00:01:36.829> sure<00:01:37.219> about
