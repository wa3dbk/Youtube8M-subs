00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:08.210
 Hello everyone in this video, we will see 

00:00:02.669 --> 00:00:12.750
 my fight on a soviet heavy tank of 4 

00:00:08.210 --> 00:00:16.340
 we are in the top of our map team 

00:00:12.750 --> 00:00:24.060
 open and but there is only one artillery 

00:00:16.340 --> 00:00:28.050
 the enemy and it batchat and causes 

00:00:24.060 --> 00:00:30.840
 he is not a lot of Soviet damage 

00:00:28.050 --> 00:00:34.320
 equipment is generally the main chip 

00:00:30.840 --> 00:00:37.440
 Soviet technicians are what they are 

00:00:34.320 --> 00:00:40.680
 artillery beats weaker than for example 

00:00:37.440 --> 00:00:44.309
 the same german so i'm bravely going 

00:00:40.680 --> 00:00:49.260
 in the usual place for the heavy here 

00:00:44.309 --> 00:00:50.280
 to start a shootout with the enemy 

00:00:49.260 --> 00:00:53.610
 whots 

00:00:50.280 --> 00:00:57.750
 one hundred percent will also be occupying here 

00:00:53.610 --> 00:01:00.090
 position behind the stone does not break me t110 

00:00:57.750 --> 00:01:05.489
 e5 see further from 3 

00:01:00.090 --> 00:01:07.320
 and begins tanking overboard I'm trying 

00:01:05.489 --> 00:01:10.570
 tank we change nonetheless 

00:01:07.320 --> 00:01:13.369
 breaks out of 4 

00:01:10.570 --> 00:01:18.939
 artillery misses no punches already 

00:01:13.369 --> 00:01:20.600
 4 I made my way 100 ten 

00:01:18.939 --> 00:01:23.060
 see further 

00:01:20.600 --> 00:01:25.280
 the algorithm algorithm of their actions is to leave 

00:01:23.060 --> 00:01:26.470
 substitute the board which is pretty 

00:01:25.280 --> 00:01:31.610
 heavy Prague 

00:01:26.470 --> 00:01:34.990
 link 4 I notice that they are trying to get me 

00:01:31.610 --> 00:01:38.780
 walk around on the other side from back yet 

00:01:34.990 --> 00:01:44.569
 because i'm alone here but i see that for 

00:01:38.780 --> 00:01:50.179
 they do not cover our tanks in that 

00:01:44.569 --> 00:01:52.819
 number and goa 100 affects the picture she 

00:01:50.179 --> 00:01:58.159
 puts me on a harp i spend repair 

00:01:52.819 --> 00:02:01.329
 because DPM ancient times or rather this 

00:01:58.159 --> 00:02:04.740
 never quite good therefore 

00:02:01.329 --> 00:02:07.229
 drive off the fireplaces 

00:02:04.740 --> 00:02:09.780
 and keep on doing damage with me 

00:02:07.229 --> 00:02:12.959
 still I get from one artillery 

00:02:09.780 --> 00:02:16.489
 a bun a direct hit in the tower on top 

00:02:12.959 --> 00:02:20.400
 as you see here's a red hit on 

00:02:16.489 --> 00:02:24.290
 548 crow hurts it besides 

00:02:20.400 --> 00:02:29.069
 the tower that is it is slower and 

00:02:24.290 --> 00:02:30.950
 on-site tanking continues 

00:02:29.069 --> 00:02:33.239
 as you can see i am not standing 

00:02:30.950 --> 00:02:37.290
 constantly maneuvering according to 

00:02:33.239 --> 00:02:39.440
 hit artillery artillery stands here 

00:02:37.290 --> 00:02:42.230
 at a considerable distance 

00:02:39.440 --> 00:02:45.299
 so if you don't stand still 

00:02:42.230 --> 00:02:47.239
 maneuver then because of the time 

00:02:45.299 --> 00:02:49.890
 projectile flight 

00:02:47.239 --> 00:02:51.450
 artillery which is usually located 

00:02:49.890 --> 00:02:54.600
 somewhere here or here 

00:02:51.450 --> 00:02:56.610
 makes 2 and more seconds that is 

00:02:54.600 --> 00:02:59.519
 it is quite possible that she 

00:02:56.610 --> 00:03:05.390
 miss what you saw in this fight then 

00:02:59.519 --> 00:03:05.390
 there are quite a few misses for me 

00:03:06.080 --> 00:03:13.700
 I'm trying to target 263 here, but not 

00:03:09.560 --> 00:03:20.570
 it turns out and continuing the pressure from this 

00:03:13.700 --> 00:03:26.060
 flank helping presses the leftovers here 

00:03:20.570 --> 00:03:28.790
 enemy tanks and finish off her last 

00:03:26.060 --> 00:03:31.250
 this is the t-34 at the same time on 

00:03:28.790 --> 00:03:33.910
 opposite flank exactly the same 

00:03:31.250 --> 00:03:35.150
 maneuver ie pushing through 

00:03:33.910 --> 00:03:43.700
 st 

00:03:35.150 --> 00:03:46.820
 our and several heavy tanks on this 

00:03:43.700 --> 00:03:51.340
 will be ending for this fight received 

00:03:46.820 --> 00:03:54.440
 I read the main 

00:03:51.340 --> 00:03:58.040
 main sign for then by your team 

00:03:54.440 --> 00:04:00.250
 heavy tank is a steel wall then 

00:03:58.040 --> 00:04:07.040
 I have taken on quite a lot 

00:04:00.250 --> 00:04:09.940
 as you see the end of the battle here is very 

00:04:07.040 --> 00:04:13.810
 many non penetrations were blocked 

00:04:09.940 --> 00:04:17.560
 enough damage what you see by 

00:04:13.810 --> 00:04:21.290
 screenshots on the last screenshot where 

00:04:17.560 --> 00:04:24.290
 specified how much damage potential 

00:04:21.290 --> 00:04:28.090
 I took over the tank that is, I think 

00:04:24.290 --> 00:04:31.100
 I my task in this battle fulfilled 

00:04:28.090 --> 00:04:36.149
 took over enough 

00:04:31.100 --> 00:04:39.479
 hits and helped push the tank 

00:04:36.149 --> 00:04:43.179
 our tanks one of the enemyâ€™s flanks 

00:04:39.479 --> 00:04:47.349
 at the same time and strangely I caused damage 

00:04:43.179 --> 00:04:51.399
 also turned out to be quite a lot 

00:04:47.349 --> 00:04:53.830
 Best for damage thanks for
