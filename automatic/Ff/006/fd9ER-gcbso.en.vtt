verdure<00:02:11.039> about<00:02:11.370> the<00:02:11.489> particle<00:02:12.000> size<00:02:12.180> how<00:02:12.450> is

00:02:12.950 --> 00:02:12.960 
verdure about the particle size how is

00:02:12.960 --> 00:02:15.530 
verdure about the particle size how is
a<00:02:13.050> little<00:02:13.470> bit<00:02:13.620> larger<00:02:14.520> and<00:02:14.790> how<00:02:15.150> they<00:02:15.330> can

00:02:37.760 --> 00:02:37.770 
and another product called radius this

00:02:37.770 --> 00:02:41.000 
and another product called radius this
is<00:02:37.830> something<00:02:38.400> that<00:02:38.430> is<00:02:38.850> a<00:02:39.620> favorite<00:02:40.620> of<00:02:40.860> mine

00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:41.010 
is something that is a favorite of mine

00:02:41.010 --> 00:02:43.360 
is something that is a favorite of mine
I<00:02:41.160> used<00:02:41.190> a<00:02:41.520> lot<00:02:41.700> of<00:02:41.730> radius<00:02:42.210> in<00:02:42.420> this<00:02:42.750> practice

00:02:43.360 --> 00:02:43.370 
I used a lot of radius in this practice

00:02:43.370 --> 00:02:46.790 
I used a lot of radius in this practice
basically<00:02:44.370> it<00:02:44.820> comes<00:02:45.060> in<00:02:45.210> 1.5<00:02:46.140> CC<00:02:46.590> syringes

00:02:46.790 --> 00:02:46.800 
basically it comes in 1.5 CC syringes

00:02:46.800 --> 00:02:49.670 
basically it comes in 1.5 CC syringes
something<00:02:47.610> like<00:02:47.730> this<00:02:47.940> it's<00:02:48.630> like<00:02:48.780> a<00:02:48.810> calcium

00:02:49.670 --> 00:02:49.680 
something like this it's like a calcium

00:02:49.680 --> 00:02:52.610 
something like this it's like a calcium
basically<00:02:50.640> calcium<00:02:51.180> gel<00:02:51.420> it's<00:02:52.080> just<00:02:52.290> really

00:02:52.610 --> 00:02:52.620 
basically calcium gel it's just really

00:02:52.620 --> 00:02:55.100 
basically calcium gel it's just really
beautiful<00:02:52.950> volume<00:02:53.430> filling<00:02:53.970> in<00:02:54.120> laugh<00:02:54.780> lines

and<00:02:55.440> if<00:02:55.500> you<00:02:55.620> want<00:02:55.800> to<00:02:55.920> lift<00:02:56.280> and<00:02:57.210> what<00:02:57.990> it<00:02:58.140> is

00:02:58.250 --> 00:02:58.260 
and if you want to lift and what it is

00:02:58.260 --> 00:03:01.250 
and if you want to lift and what it is
is<00:02:58.500> the<00:02:58.620> calcium<00:02:58.860> is<00:02:59.190> absorbed<00:02:59.340> into<00:02:59.930> the<00:03:00.930> skin

00:03:01.250 --> 00:03:01.260 
is the calcium is absorbed into the skin

00:03:01.260 --> 00:03:03.350 
is the calcium is absorbed into the skin
and<00:03:01.470> it<00:03:01.860> stimulates<00:03:02.100> collagen<00:03:02.640> growth<00:03:03.030> your

00:03:03.350 --> 00:03:03.360 
and it stimulates collagen growth your

00:03:03.360 --> 00:03:05.180 
and it stimulates collagen growth your
body<00:03:03.570> couldn't<00:03:03.960> generate<00:03:04.140> its<00:03:04.440> own<00:03:04.500> collagen

00:03:05.180 --> 00:03:05.190 
body couldn't generate its own collagen

00:03:05.190 --> 00:03:06.800 
body couldn't generate its own collagen
and<00:03:05.580> I'm<00:03:05.790> gonna<00:03:05.910> show<00:03:06.120> you<00:03:06.150> a<00:03:06.270> little<00:03:06.390> clip<00:03:06.750> a

00:03:06.800 --> 00:03:06.810 
and I'm gonna show you a little clip a

00:03:06.810 --> 00:03:08.900 
and I'm gonna show you a little clip a
little<00:03:07.200> video<00:03:07.380> so<00:03:07.560> you<00:03:07.800> can<00:03:07.950> kind<00:03:08.130> of<00:03:08.160> see<00:03:08.400> have

00:03:08.900 --> 00:03:08.910 
little video so you can kind of see have

00:03:08.910 --> 00:03:10.820 
little video so you can kind of see have
idea<00:03:09.300> what<00:03:09.360> it<00:03:09.690> is<00:03:09.720> so<00:03:10.410> go<00:03:10.530> ahead<00:03:10.590> and<00:03:10.710> watch

00:03:10.820 --> 00:03:10.830 
idea what it is so go ahead and watch

00:03:10.830 --> 00:03:15.650 
idea what it is so go ahead and watch
that<00:03:10.920> video<00:03:11.190> right<00:03:11.520> now<00:03:11.550> and<00:03:13.850> the<00:03:14.850> gel<00:03:15.180> carrier

filler<00:03:18.300> provide<00:03:19.110> the<00:03:19.260> immediate<00:03:19.740> volume

00:03:20.150 --> 00:03:20.160 
filler provide the immediate volume

00:03:20.160 --> 00:03:22.280 
filler provide the immediate volume
needed<00:03:20.490> to<00:03:20.640> provide<00:03:20.940> lift<00:03:21.300> and<00:03:21.660> diminish<00:03:22.110> the

radius<00:03:25.170> volumizing<00:03:25.920> filler<00:03:26.190> is<00:03:26.460> what<00:03:26.730> happens

00:03:27.080 --> 00:03:27.090 
radius volumizing filler is what happens

00:03:27.090 --> 00:03:29.810 
radius volumizing filler is what happens
under<00:03:27.330> the<00:03:27.570> skin<00:03:27.840> after<00:03:28.530> treatment<00:03:28.980> radius

volumizing<00:03:30.630> filler<00:03:30.930> acts<00:03:31.290> as<00:03:31.560> a<00:03:31.590> scaffold

00:03:32.140 --> 00:03:32.150 
volumizing filler acts as a scaffold

00:03:32.150 --> 00:03:34.850 
volumizing filler acts as a scaffold
