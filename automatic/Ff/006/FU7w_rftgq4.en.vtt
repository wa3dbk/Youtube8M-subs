00:01:48.620 --> 00:01:48.630 
here and I have a villager egg see they

00:01:48.630 --> 00:01:50.870 
here and I have a villager egg see they
won't<00:01:48.750> spawn<00:01:49.140> they'll<00:01:49.710> spawn<00:01:50.009> outside<00:01:50.520> and

00:01:50.870 --> 00:01:50.880 
won't spawn they'll spawn outside and

00:01:50.880 --> 00:01:53.179 
won't spawn they'll spawn outside and
they're<00:01:51.000> able<00:01:51.119> to<00:01:51.299> walk<00:01:51.600> inside<00:01:52.200> but<00:01:53.070> they

00:01:53.179 --> 00:01:53.189 
they're able to walk inside but they

00:01:53.189 --> 00:01:58.910 
they're able to walk inside but they
won't<00:01:53.399> spawn<00:01:54.290> you<00:01:55.290> know<00:01:55.409> in<00:01:55.649> here<00:01:56.930> so<00:01:57.930> I<00:01:58.259> think

00:01:58.910 --> 00:01:58.920 
won't spawn you know in here so I think

00:01:58.920 --> 00:02:01.120 
won't spawn you know in here so I think

00:02:01.120 --> 00:02:01.130 
again I said this was safe zoned to

00:02:01.130 --> 00:02:03.380 
again I said this was safe zoned to
enable<00:02:02.130> building<00:02:02.579> so<00:02:02.820> if<00:02:02.939> you<00:02:03.030> wanted<00:02:03.270> you

00:02:03.380 --> 00:02:03.390 
enable building so if you wanted you

00:02:03.390 --> 00:02:04.910 
enable building so if you wanted you
know<00:02:03.479> select<00:02:03.810> your<00:02:03.960> whole<00:02:04.079> world<00:02:04.350> like<00:02:04.710> this
