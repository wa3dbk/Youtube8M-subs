00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.049
 hello to all and welcome to this 

00:00:01.350 --> 00:00:05.580
 video my last video starts 

00:00:04.049 --> 00:00:08.370
 today to date that's why I 

00:00:05.580 --> 00:00:11.190
 decided to put myself back to the videos and 

00:00:08.370 --> 00:00:13.469
 today after my work on lehman 

00:00:11.190 --> 00:00:14.969
 map and on the slaughterhouse enclosures I 

00:00:13.469 --> 00:00:17.670
 decided to work on the production 

00:00:14.969 --> 00:00:18.380
 automatic food and others 

00:00:17.670 --> 00:00:21.029
 things 

00:00:18.380 --> 00:00:23.760
 it gave birth to the map that 

00:00:21.029 --> 00:00:25.039
 i call cpae or production centers 

00:00:23.760 --> 00:00:27.300
 agricultural and livestock 

00:00:25.039 --> 00:00:28.710
 so it's a huge center in 

00:00:27.300 --> 00:00:31.050
 which produced the most comas 

00:00:28.710 --> 00:00:32.730
 tically possible and in mass 

00:00:31.050 --> 00:00:36.059
 foods that are 

00:00:32.730 --> 00:00:39.739
 plant or animal and are sold 

00:00:36.059 --> 00:00:43.469
 directly in a supermarket 

00:00:39.739 --> 00:00:45.210
 included at the center the production so a 

00:00:43.469 --> 00:00:48.059
 balance such center can be achieved on 

00:00:45.210 --> 00:00:50.160
 a server to feed on a big 

00:00:48.059 --> 00:00:55.170
 server to feed a lot of people or 

00:00:50.160 --> 00:00:58.410
 solo on a small scale for a single 

00:00:55.170 --> 00:00:59.090
 nobody but really very very very 

00:00:58.410 --> 00:01:01.050
 easily 

00:00:59.090 --> 00:01:04.250
 you will not miss any more food 

00:01:01.050 --> 00:01:06.390
 with a particular establishment 

00:01:04.250 --> 00:01:08.340
 so here is a small aerial view 

00:01:06.390 --> 00:01:12.060
 from the center it takes a little time to 

00:01:08.340 --> 00:01:14.490
 load as I make the video here 

00:01:12.060 --> 00:01:16.950
 we are in front of the entrance here we are 

00:01:14.490 --> 00:01:19.860
 from the supermarket here we can see the plan 

00:01:16.950 --> 00:01:22.860
 from the center so this video she's going 

00:01:19.860 --> 00:01:26.130
 serve to introduce to do a little 

00:01:22.860 --> 00:01:28.350
 quick tour of the center and after I 

00:01:26.130 --> 00:01:33.540
 will devote a video to each of 

00:01:28.350 --> 00:01:34.530
 automatic systems of the center so we 

00:01:33.540 --> 00:01:36.180
 try to topic is to make 

00:01:34.530 --> 00:01:37.500
 most automatic systems possible 

00:01:36.180 --> 00:01:39.689
 so some systems are semi 

00:01:37.500 --> 00:01:41.250
 automatic others are automatic 

00:01:39.689 --> 00:01:42.990
 not all systems can be 

00:01:41.250 --> 00:01:45.420
 fully automatic causes 

00:01:42.990 --> 00:01:47.960
 limitations of the game so here we are 

00:01:45.420 --> 00:01:50.720
 in the supermarket 

00:01:47.960 --> 00:01:51.619
 distributors with all that 

00:01:50.720 --> 00:01:55.790
 it is produced in the center 

00:01:51.619 --> 00:01:57.650
 so here everyone here a whole 

00:01:55.790 --> 00:01:59.360
 server can come to refuel in 

00:01:57.650 --> 00:02:00.680
 in different commodities that are even 

00:01:59.360 --> 00:02:02.540
 not necessarily food since we're going 

00:02:00.680 --> 00:02:04.130
 talk about it in the big cactus too where he 

00:02:02.540 --> 00:02:05.960
 there is a wooden shop of a acts of 

00:02:04.130 --> 00:02:09.220
 the aisne really we try to produce 

00:02:05.960 --> 00:02:11.420
 everything that is easily producible 

00:02:09.220 --> 00:02:13.310
 but if it is the breeding center 

00:02:11.420 --> 00:02:15.020
 so it's going to improve jobs 

00:02:13.310 --> 00:02:17.870
 oven beater so they still produce 

00:02:15.020 --> 00:02:23.230
 simpler and so we are there stale of 

00:02:17.870 --> 00:02:23.230
 animals we will go make a little robot 

00:02:24.580 --> 00:02:32.480
 here we find the serra melon or rather 

00:02:28.790 --> 00:02:34.580
 presstek is here so we produce the 

00:02:32.480 --> 00:02:36.500
 pumpkins here is the system itself 

00:02:34.580 --> 00:02:41.120
 I will introduce you in my next 

00:02:36.500 --> 00:02:43.220
 video here I created effects of 

00:02:41.120 --> 00:02:44.360
 pigs with stool in the canes 

00:02:43.220 --> 00:02:47.950
 fishing to move faster 

00:02:44.360 --> 00:02:52.100
 in the center of his big size 

00:02:47.950 --> 00:02:53.660
 there you can see the cocoa lasserre 

00:02:52.100 --> 00:02:56.500
 since now we can grow 

00:02:53.660 --> 00:02:59.720
 cocoa which is quite practical 

00:02:56.500 --> 00:03:00.860
 here mushroom cultivation so the 

00:02:59.720 --> 00:03:04.370
 giant mushrooms are for the moment 

00:03:00.860 --> 00:03:06.530
 the best way to grow cement from 

00:03:04.370 --> 00:03:08.329
 mushroom one manufactures which one cultivates 

00:03:06.530 --> 00:03:10.640
 also wood here so with this these 

00:03:08.329 --> 00:03:14.420
 small forests of all types of wood 

00:03:10.640 --> 00:03:20.870
 that there is so this wood is sold here 

00:03:14.420 --> 00:03:26.810
 in the little shop we make 

00:03:20.870 --> 00:03:29.180
 also dyes so here this little 

00:03:26.810 --> 00:03:33.440
 parterre is also to cultivate 

00:03:29.180 --> 00:03:36.590
 seeds and therefore flowers thanks to the 

00:03:33.440 --> 00:03:38.769
 bone powder if you have ten pens 

00:03:36.590 --> 00:03:42.130
 colored sheep for the same color 

00:03:38.769 --> 00:03:42.130
 launched in part 

00:03:42.510 --> 00:03:51.150
 it's big there so many shocks 

00:03:47.420 --> 00:03:54.360
 here is the fishing rod with the cane to 

00:03:51.150 --> 00:03:58.140
 sugar per year through a system 

00:03:54.360 --> 00:04:05.120
 automatic piston and current 

00:03:58.140 --> 00:04:05.120
 others there we can see the cactus 

00:04:06.290 --> 00:04:11.010
 always according to m as well as with 

00:04:09.120 --> 00:04:12.950
 pistons and water currents I 

00:04:11.010 --> 00:04:15.150
 will detail in the next hours 

00:04:12.950 --> 00:04:19.049
 then above the center of 

00:04:15.150 --> 00:04:23.160
 production you have the greenhouse so the 

00:04:19.049 --> 00:04:26.910
 very big greenhouse of wheat here there are 400 

00:04:23.160 --> 00:04:28.710
 wheat systems so that's done 

00:04:26.910 --> 00:04:30.449
 a lot of food not only 

00:04:28.710 --> 00:04:32.280
 their blades recalled is a semi system 

00:04:30.449 --> 00:04:36.600
 automatic since you have to replant 

00:04:32.280 --> 00:04:39.900
 the hand here is the practical side of the 

00:04:36.600 --> 00:04:41.760
 wheat I would say it's the same thing for 

00:04:39.900 --> 00:04:44.190
 carrots and potatoes that have been 

00:04:41.760 --> 00:04:49.410
 introduced recently in the game that 

00:04:44.190 --> 00:04:51.599
 I placed here outside so here we go 

00:04:49.410 --> 00:04:53.789
 we see that this center is enough is 

00:04:51.599 --> 00:04:56.130
 big enough and really produces a lot 

00:04:53.789 --> 00:04:59.760
 a lot of the food theme there there 

00:04:56.130 --> 00:05:01.740
 really have a lot of people before 

00:04:59.760 --> 00:05:06.830
 I'll let you do if the 

00:05:01.740 --> 00:05:09.830
 cavs is the breeding center 

00:05:06.830 --> 00:05:12.630
 here we produce warts 

00:05:09.830 --> 00:05:14.699
 of universe there is an underground lake 

00:05:12.630 --> 00:05:16.260
 intended for fishing and a shop of 

00:05:14.699 --> 00:05:20.610
 magic they have magic sytÃ¨mes 

00:05:16.260 --> 00:05:25.440
 for him on the center so here is the 

00:05:20.610 --> 00:05:29.650
 come universe here 

00:05:25.440 --> 00:05:32.350
 on earth here we go we go for a role 

00:05:29.650 --> 00:05:34.150
 increased the ability to fish for 

00:05:32.350 --> 00:05:36.780
 manual fishing there is no way to fish 

00:05:34.150 --> 00:05:39.550
 fish automatically unfortunately 

00:05:36.780 --> 00:05:41.080
 I wanted to do even a little by little 

00:05:39.550 --> 00:05:46.240
 really driving it all it is 

00:05:41.080 --> 00:05:48.700
 possible to eat and I wanted to do 

00:05:46.240 --> 00:05:51.010
 a magic shop too since 

00:05:48.700 --> 00:05:53.290
 it is many hours of things that 

00:05:51.010 --> 00:05:55.800
 found in the concept of magic and 

00:05:53.290 --> 00:05:59.940
 of cultivable items here is the shop 

00:05:55.800 --> 00:05:59.940
 is not quite finished yet 

00:06:00.600 --> 00:06:07.090
 but she is already well advanced 

00:06:05.470 --> 00:06:10.270
 here I did a little visit 

00:06:07.090 --> 00:06:12.370
 fast of those to suspend and so 

00:06:10.270 --> 00:06:14.350
 after I will detail you each of 

00:06:12.370 --> 00:06:15.990
 systems precisely during my 

00:06:14.350 --> 00:06:18.550
 next videos 

00:06:15.990 --> 00:06:19.030
 do not hesitate to leave a small 

00:06:18.550 --> 00:06:22.030
 comment 

00:06:19.030 --> 00:06:23.920
 you liked the name besides is a 

00:06:22.030 --> 00:06:24.450
 little bit their possibly always 

00:06:23.920 --> 00:06:27.670
 pleasure 

00:06:24.450 --> 00:06:29.290
 subscribe too thank you for having 

00:06:27.670 --> 00:06:31.710
