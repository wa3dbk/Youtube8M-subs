00:02:14.340 --> 00:02:17.240 
the panels out but anyway this morning I
got<00:02:15.030> up<00:02:15.290> actually<00:02:16.290> didn't<00:02:16.500> go<00:02:16.620> to<00:02:16.680> sleep<00:02:17.010> I

00:02:17.240 --> 00:02:17.250 
got up actually didn't go to sleep I

00:02:17.250 --> 00:02:19.940 
got up actually didn't go to sleep I
just<00:02:17.520> had<00:02:18.420> to<00:02:18.600> work<00:02:19.110> on<00:02:19.320> this<00:02:19.560> baby

00:02:19.940 --> 00:02:19.950 
just had to work on this baby

00:02:19.950 --> 00:02:22.640 
just had to work on this baby
because<00:02:20.940> there<00:02:21.450> was<00:02:21.570> a<00:02:21.600> squeal<00:02:21.930> coming<00:02:22.350> from

00:02:22.640 --> 00:02:22.650 
because there was a squeal coming from

00:02:22.650 --> 00:02:24.320 
because there was a squeal coming from
somewhere<00:02:23.400> and<00:02:23.430> I<00:02:23.700> thought<00:02:23.850> it<00:02:24.030> was<00:02:24.120> the

00:02:24.320 --> 00:02:24.330 
somewhere and I thought it was the

00:02:24.330 --> 00:02:27.590 
somewhere and I thought it was the
roller<00:02:24.690> bearings<00:02:25.340> were<00:02:26.340> the<00:02:26.490> drum<00:02:26.730> rides<00:02:27.030> and

00:02:27.590 --> 00:02:27.600 
roller bearings were the drum rides and

00:02:27.600 --> 00:02:30.560 
roller bearings were the drum rides and
then<00:02:28.440> I<00:02:28.530> thought<00:02:28.740> it<00:02:28.860> was<00:02:28.980> the<00:02:29.190> idle<00:02:29.700> pulley

00:02:30.560 --> 00:02:30.570 
then I thought it was the idle pulley

00:02:30.570 --> 00:02:33.650 
then I thought it was the idle pulley
arm<00:02:31.400> bearing<00:02:32.400> but<00:02:32.820> that<00:02:33.000> wasn't<00:02:33.360> it

00:02:33.650 --> 00:02:33.660 
arm bearing but that wasn't it

00:02:33.660 --> 00:02:36.110 
arm bearing but that wasn't it
and<00:02:33.800> when<00:02:34.800> I<00:02:34.830> disassemble<00:02:35.430> everything<00:02:35.550> of

00:02:36.110 --> 00:02:36.120 
and when I disassemble everything of

00:02:36.120 --> 00:02:39.560 
and when I disassemble everything of
course<00:02:36.180> it<00:02:36.900> was<00:02:37.230> the<00:02:37.590> motor<00:02:37.830> itself<00:02:38.280> and<00:02:38.760> what

00:02:39.560 --> 00:02:39.570 
course it was the motor itself and what

00:02:39.570 --> 00:02:42.500 
course it was the motor itself and what
I<00:02:39.600> found<00:02:39.900> when<00:02:40.290> I<00:02:40.320> opened<00:02:40.800> this<00:02:41.580> whole<00:02:41.880> panel

00:02:42.500 --> 00:02:42.510 
I found when I opened this whole panel

00:02:42.510 --> 00:02:46.940 
I found when I opened this whole panel
it<00:02:42.870> was<00:02:43.620> completely<00:02:44.310> and<00:02:45.410> ended<00:02:46.410> dated<00:02:46.769> with

00:02:46.940 --> 00:02:46.950 
it was completely and ended dated with

00:02:46.950 --> 00:02:50.090 
it was completely and ended dated with
lint<00:02:47.519> in<00:02:47.760> there<00:02:48.209> and<00:02:48.420> some<00:02:49.320> lint<00:02:49.560> went<00:02:49.830> in<00:02:49.950> the

00:02:50.090 --> 00:02:50.100 
lint in there and some lint went in the

00:02:50.100 --> 00:02:53.690 
lint in there and some lint went in the
bearing<00:02:50.959> housing<00:02:51.959> of<00:02:52.350> the<00:02:52.410> motor<00:02:52.980> front<00:02:53.459> and

00:02:53.690 --> 00:02:53.700 
bearing housing of the motor front and

00:02:53.700 --> 00:02:57.080 
bearing housing of the motor front and
and<00:02:53.910> rear<00:02:54.450> and<00:02:55.760> well<00:02:56.760> I

00:02:57.080 --> 00:02:57.090 
and rear and well I

00:02:57.090 --> 00:03:00.190 
and rear and well I
I<00:02:57.420> got<00:02:57.870> a<00:02:58.110> vacuum<00:02:58.620> cleaner<00:02:58.769> I<00:02:59.130> vacuumed<00:02:59.760> it

00:03:00.190 --> 00:03:00.200 
I got a vacuum cleaner I vacuumed it

00:03:00.200 --> 00:03:05.030 
I got a vacuum cleaner I vacuumed it

00:03:05.030 --> 00:03:05.040 
then I got CRC 2-26 electrical spray

00:03:05.040 --> 00:03:07.729 
then I got CRC 2-26 electrical spray
which<00:03:05.340> is<00:03:05.370> a<00:03:05.580> lubricant<00:03:06.120> as<00:03:06.239> well<00:03:06.450> and<00:03:06.750> I

00:03:07.729 --> 00:03:07.739 
which is a lubricant as well and I

00:03:07.739 --> 00:03:11.540 
which is a lubricant as well and I
sprayed<00:03:08.190> some<00:03:08.220> in<00:03:08.670> the<00:03:09.739> in<00:03:10.739> the<00:03:11.130> bearings

00:03:11.540 --> 00:03:11.550 
sprayed some in the in the bearings

00:03:11.550 --> 00:03:13.699 
sprayed some in the in the bearings
there<00:03:11.880> and<00:03:12.120> that<00:03:12.750> did<00:03:12.959> the<00:03:13.080> trick<00:03:13.230> I<00:03:13.470> thought<00:03:13.680> I
