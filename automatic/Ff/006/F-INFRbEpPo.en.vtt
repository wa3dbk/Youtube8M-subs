00:00:04.890 --> 00:00:08.049
 Is immaterial not by Hello Information and Culture Studies 

00:00:09.259 --> 00:00:12.999
 I wrote a paper on the problem of dysfunctional families 

00:00:13.649 --> 00:00:17.140
 First of all, I can imagine what a dysfunctional family is like 

00:00:17.140 --> 00:00:19.130
 Isn't it 

00:00:19.130 --> 00:00:23.699
 As the memorial dysfunctional family is the day originally existing in the home 

00:00:23.699 --> 00:00:27.099
 I will say that I am not pregnant at the interview 

00:00:27.099 --> 00:00:30.140
 Especially what is taken up here is the merger of Cux 

00:00:30.140 --> 00:00:32.470
 Parents who can not do it is a problem 

00:00:32.470 --> 00:00:34.569
 Problems to bring before the game on this day 

00:00:34.569 --> 00:00:38.170
 More than a problem with unhealthy people in the home 

00:00:38.170 --> 00:00:41.220
 Rather grew up in the whole family with its function 

00:00:41.220 --> 00:00:45.050
 It seems that negative effects on children's pictures are often pointed out 

00:00:45.990 --> 00:00:50.409
 In other words, the child who grew up in the last examination home in the function 

00:00:50.409 --> 00:00:53.030
 Environment has a way of thinking without dysfunction 

00:00:53.030 --> 00:00:54.660
 It's a government office or a way of thinking 

00:00:54.660 --> 00:00:57.660
 Recognized as general and easy to grow 

00:00:59.030 --> 00:01:04.240
 There is a great opportunity to resign in the formation of important personalities in childhood 

00:01:04.240 --> 00:01:05.390
 Be scared 

00:01:05.390 --> 00:01:08.290
 Bring your self love and strengthen the system 

00:01:08.290 --> 00:01:12.640
 People who have lost their answers because of other players' play ear systems are also human 

00:01:12.640 --> 00:01:15.170
 It is said that it is easy to understand 

00:01:15.170 --> 00:01:19.840
 The result is a healthy relationship with the world through a dysfunctional family 

00:01:19.840 --> 00:01:22.850
 It means that the adult who can not do is abolished 

00:01:25.510 --> 00:01:29.240
 The specific explanation about dysfunctional families is 

00:01:29.240 --> 00:01:31.990
 It is a feature of Murdock 

00:01:31.990 --> 00:01:35.970
 Murdock functions as a social group 

00:01:35.970 --> 00:01:38.970
 I'm paying attention to being 

00:01:40.050 --> 00:01:42.680
 Raw bible education 

00:01:42.680 --> 00:01:43.479
 Economy 

00:01:43.479 --> 00:01:45.260
 I am missing again 

00:01:45.260 --> 00:01:47.950
 In performing these functions 

00:01:47.950 --> 00:01:52.880
 Collective family members characterized economically by intense contact 

00:01:52.880 --> 00:01:55.200
 Stipulates that 

00:01:55.200 --> 00:01:58.370
 In this way, as a family function 

00:01:58.370 --> 00:02:01.450
 These features are currently being changed 

00:02:01.450 --> 00:02:05.340
 For example, the function of child care may be performed in a nursery 

00:02:05.340 --> 00:02:06.180
 Can 

00:02:06.180 --> 00:02:09.610
 The function of education can also be performed 

00:02:10.619 --> 00:02:14.249
 Even if you go to the supermarket now to get the ingredients immediately 

00:02:14.249 --> 00:02:15.989
 It is something to get in 

00:02:15.989 --> 00:02:18.929
 Father works to make money 

00:02:18.929 --> 00:02:22.209
 The role of mothers to spend the money is different 

00:02:23.229 --> 00:02:27.269
 It was before in the prefecture, but snow does not necessarily fulfill 

00:02:27.269 --> 00:02:29.429
 I can not say 

00:02:29.429 --> 00:02:32.559
 Period that will be the role or even without two 

00:02:32.559 --> 00:02:34.729
 There is 

00:02:34.729 --> 00:02:38.449
 So what is considered to be a problem in functional training families 

00:02:38.449 --> 00:02:41.589
 That parents can not say they love their children 

00:02:41.589 --> 00:02:43.819
 is 

00:02:43.819 --> 00:02:46.909
 What exactly is Thailand? 

00:02:46.909 --> 00:02:49.909
 Evaluation of the body in the world of each gate 

00:02:51.139 --> 00:02:54.059
 Is there really a large number of 2 

00:02:54.059 --> 00:02:57.079
 Here's a family issue 

00:02:57.079 --> 00:03:00.200
 Psychological and social relationships between the family 

00:03:00.200 --> 00:03:02.339
 It's time to snow 

00:03:02.339 --> 00:03:05.229
 I would like to take up the idea of â€‹â€‹Fram's classic 

00:03:05.229 --> 00:03:08.229
 I think 

00:03:09.519 --> 00:03:13.719
 Furano's only use is the intention of a lonely person trying to kill loneliness 

00:03:13.719 --> 00:03:14.210
 Yes 

00:03:14.210 --> 00:03:15.180
 aiko yeah 

00:03:15.180 --> 00:03:19.190
 The best technology to live in good happiness in a real society 

00:03:19.190 --> 00:03:19.959
 As being 

00:03:19.959 --> 00:03:23.019
 Excuse me as follows 

00:03:23.019 --> 00:03:24.489
 I did it like fire 

00:03:24.489 --> 00:03:26.739
 Yodogawa commercial materials lost 

00:03:26.739 --> 00:03:29.099
 Ise men and women middle rank 

00:03:29.099 --> 00:03:30.069
 God's love 

00:03:30.069 --> 00:03:32.750
 I am a patent attorney and so on 

00:03:32.750 --> 00:03:34.879
 If the bath can also occur 

00:03:34.879 --> 00:03:37.739
 Stated that it comes from desire 

00:03:37.739 --> 00:03:40.239
 It is negative 

00:03:40.239 --> 00:03:42.699
 The most important phase of this is 

00:03:42.699 --> 00:03:45.319
 The love of mothers and the beginning of each other 

00:03:45.319 --> 00:03:46.619
 From mother 

00:03:46.619 --> 00:03:49.859
 States that he is a candidate 

00:03:49.859 --> 00:03:54.099
 I bought it from my mother and got it this time somebody is worth it 

00:03:54.099 --> 00:03:57.099
 A person can not be loved 

00:03:57.099 --> 00:04:00.849
 Having said that even in the gods were separate Christians 

00:04:00.849 --> 00:04:02.869
 Even if it is the effect 

00:04:02.869 --> 00:04:04.290
 Voiced up 

00:04:04.290 --> 00:04:08.459
 Kannon's i-mode one-work conviction is as important in common 

00:04:08.459 --> 00:04:10.599
 It is supposed to be 

00:04:10.599 --> 00:04:11.900
 I gave it from my mother 

00:04:11.900 --> 00:04:15.639
 Warm affection and retail strict attendance from father 

00:04:15.639 --> 00:04:16.809
 This balance is 

00:04:16.809 --> 00:04:20.159
 It is considered to be human and important 

00:04:20.159 --> 00:04:24.409
 Present-day family by taking care of the defeated Thailand 

00:04:24.409 --> 00:04:27.409
 Would like to reconsider the problem 

00:04:30.349 --> 00:04:33.349
 This is what happens when being called Hiraishi 

00:04:34.009 --> 00:04:36.939
 It is dysfunctional 

00:04:36.939 --> 00:04:40.169
 The following is great for raising a child 

00:04:41.090 --> 00:04:44.440
 As you can see from this figure, it was physically in range 

00:04:44.440 --> 00:04:45.080
 As 

00:04:45.080 --> 00:04:48.500
 I have a mental problem that I can not love children 

00:04:48.500 --> 00:04:50.620
 I will 

00:04:50.620 --> 00:04:53.620
 How can I solve this problem 

00:04:54.120 --> 00:04:57.229
 I feel a lovable thing when I see the other promise 

00:04:58.169 --> 00:04:59.729
 I am good with animals 

00:04:59.729 --> 00:05:00.409
 Both sides 

00:05:00.409 --> 00:05:03.460
 Parent and child crematory true love breathing 

00:05:03.460 --> 00:05:06.610
 It is not a person but another family of thought 

00:05:06.610 --> 00:05:09.810
 I wondered what to do with the shape as a model 

00:05:11.469 --> 00:05:14.389
 Human beings have freedom and giving birth to children 

00:05:14.389 --> 00:05:15.689
 Identi ii 

00:05:15.689 --> 00:05:18.009
 Tub container can be selected 

00:05:18.009 --> 00:05:19.889
 But this is different 

00:05:19.889 --> 00:05:23.500
 This is a book that is automatically loved and beloved when a child is born 

00:05:23.499 --> 00:05:25.150
 I'm waiting 

00:05:25.150 --> 00:05:29.650
 Bringing animals closer to the problem that Kamaishi can not understand 

00:05:29.650 --> 00:05:31.589
 Put and learn 

00:05:31.589 --> 00:05:35.099
 A cabin that synchronizes your own way of life 

00:05:35.099 --> 00:05:38.849
 I suggest that it might be a way to think about Kiyoshi 

00:05:38.849 --> 00:05:39.830
 To do 

00:05:39.830 --> 00:05:41.240
 I have a peer at the venue
