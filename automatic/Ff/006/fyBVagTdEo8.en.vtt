00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.910
 the cycle of life and death continues 

00:00:03.900 --> 00:00:10.280
 we will live them not 

00:00:07.910 --> 00:00:12.200
 very good everyone welcome to the guide 

00:00:10.280 --> 00:00:14.330
 of Naxos this character that can both 

00:00:12.200 --> 00:00:16.910
 I mole like a jungle but I personally 

00:00:14.330 --> 00:00:18.770
 I see much more jungle potential like this 

00:00:16.910 --> 00:00:20.810
 that this guide will be dedicated to it is 

00:00:18.770 --> 00:00:22.490
 say to jungle let's start with the 

00:00:20.810 --> 00:00:24.470
 runes and brands we will use 

00:00:22.490 --> 00:00:26.480
 penetration of armor to paste a lot 

00:00:24.470 --> 00:00:28.070
 more with that stamp q we will use 

00:00:26.480 --> 00:00:30.050
 armor because it's a character that 

00:00:28.070 --> 00:00:32.000
 requires it because he is a character 

00:00:30.050 --> 00:00:34.010
 eclipse tank we will use 

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:37.070
 magic resistance to also resist 

00:00:34.010 --> 00:00:40.020
 more then logically the magic and 

00:00:37.070 --> 00:00:42.210
 fifth more armor 

00:00:40.020 --> 00:00:44.400
 we went to the master's degrees and how is it 

00:00:42.210 --> 00:00:46.200
 character so that we will upload almost everything 

00:00:44.400 --> 00:00:48.630
 to defense and a little bit of utility for 

00:00:46.200 --> 00:00:50.430
 keep that buffet because as I say to the 

00:00:48.630 --> 00:00:52.260
 be such a character that requires a lot 

00:00:50.430 --> 00:00:54.120
 of the bufos and have a good 

00:00:52.260 --> 00:00:56.190
 defending 

00:00:54.120 --> 00:00:57.600
 let's move on to the spells and 

00:00:56.190 --> 00:00:59.520
 first begin with the spells of 

00:00:57.600 --> 00:01:00.960
 invoker and this character is also not 

00:00:59.520 --> 00:01:02.610
 very complex in it is to put it in 

00:01:00.960 --> 00:01:05.070
 study and to crush you can also 

00:01:02.610 --> 00:01:06.869
 use ghostly but me to me 

00:01:05.070 --> 00:01:09.420
 honestly I like more of this me like that 

00:01:06.869 --> 00:01:11.640
 that as you see of the spell of 

00:01:09.420 --> 00:01:13.860
 character will be first maxilla the whose 

00:01:11.640 --> 00:01:15.420
 that will be our maximum damage twice as much 

00:01:13.860 --> 00:01:17.610
 followed to slow down much more to 

00:01:15.420 --> 00:01:19.259
 our enemies and finally life for 

00:01:17.610 --> 00:01:22.170
 when our enemies have many 

00:01:19.259 --> 00:01:24.680
 resistors take them more and the r then 

00:01:22.170 --> 00:01:27.560
 simply at their respective levels 

00:01:24.680 --> 00:01:29.090
 we go to the objects and as is logical if 

00:01:27.560 --> 00:01:31.130
 We 'll start with jungle 

00:01:29.090 --> 00:01:33.050
 hunter's machete and five positions 

00:01:31.130 --> 00:01:34.550
 then we will not buy the stone 

00:01:33.050 --> 00:01:36.710
 spiritual that I consider to be very 

00:01:34.550 --> 00:01:39.110
 good for the jungles after a his 

00:01:36.710 --> 00:01:41.810
 rule to increase our speed to 

00:01:39.110 --> 00:01:43.100
 the time to win and so with the 

00:01:41.810 --> 00:01:44.990
 movement speed and to the 

00:01:43.100 --> 00:01:47.060
 slowing down the enemy we will already have 

00:01:44.990 --> 00:01:48.890
 practically always stuck after 

00:01:47.060 --> 00:01:50.690
 mobility boots because we will do the 

00:01:48.890 --> 00:01:52.820
 ancient golem and have served us 

00:01:50.690 --> 00:01:54.410
 laporta of mercury but if you do not want 

00:01:52.820 --> 00:01:56.180
 do the old golem you can do 

00:01:54.410 --> 00:01:58.580
 perfectly the mercury boots in 

00:01:56.180 --> 00:02:01.009
 instead of the quick boots after a 

00:01:58.580 --> 00:02:03.020
 round win to hold more besides 

00:02:01.009 --> 00:02:05.630
 slow down our enemies even more 

00:02:03.020 --> 00:02:08.509
 in addition to slow down in area after the 

00:02:05.630 --> 00:02:10.880
 You erase the only thing so that you can hold on a lot 

00:02:08.509 --> 00:02:13.370
 more besides giving resistances to 

00:02:10.880 --> 00:02:15.320
 our allies and finally the uarm or 

00:02:13.370 --> 00:02:17.450
 although you can also dance a little and 

00:02:15.320 --> 00:02:19.790
 you can do the uar wet before or as 

00:02:17.450 --> 00:02:22.040
 you with you see depending 

00:02:19.790 --> 00:02:24.260
 of your tastes come to the law game 

00:02:22.040 --> 00:02:27.320
 If you do not like the law because 

00:02:24.260 --> 00:02:29.240
 this moment is not very very effective 

00:02:27.320 --> 00:02:32.810
 you can put 

00:02:29.240 --> 00:02:34.690
 medallÃ³n of solar and to thus endure a 

00:02:32.810 --> 00:02:38.330
 little bit more have some resistances 

00:02:34.690 --> 00:02:40.430
 sorry to have more life more regeneration 

00:02:38.330 --> 00:02:43.410
 of life and also have that nice shield 

00:02:40.430 --> 00:02:45.450
 that gives us 

00:02:43.410 --> 00:02:47.130
 let's go to the tips and first is 

00:02:45.450 --> 00:02:49.080
 say that you should always finish with 

00:02:47.130 --> 00:02:51.480
 the cv to maximize our year 

00:02:49.080 --> 00:02:53.400
 because those who do not know what 

00:02:51.480 --> 00:02:55.830
 the chain csus what it does is that at 

00:02:53.400 --> 00:02:58.410
 killing an enemy will increase our damage 

00:02:55.830 --> 00:03:00.660
 forever throughout the game in 

00:02:58.410 --> 00:03:03.690
 three or if it's a bigger bug a 

00:03:00.660 --> 00:03:05.880
 naxos dragon champion either bugs 

00:03:03.690 --> 00:03:08.160
 big any big bug we do not 

00:03:05.880 --> 00:03:10.770
 will increase by 6 is to say that we will reach 

00:03:08.160 --> 00:03:13.230
 have a very very nice damage with the q 

00:03:10.770 --> 00:03:15.150
 when we have killed many enemies 

00:03:13.230 --> 00:03:17.130
 rather, we have finished many 

00:03:15.150 --> 00:03:19.290
 enemies with the cv so as I say very 

00:03:17.130 --> 00:03:21.890
 important to kill all enemies 

00:03:19.290 --> 00:03:23.660
 with the q 

00:03:21.890 --> 00:03:25.100
 also decide that this champion has 

00:03:23.660 --> 00:03:26.690
 one of the best guns that I have 

00:03:25.100 --> 00:03:29.330
 seen in a long time at least to me 

00:03:26.690 --> 00:03:31.190
 taste is really almost impossible 

00:03:29.330 --> 00:03:33.110
 escape an asus that throws you the one 

00:03:31.190 --> 00:03:34.760
 has the red that even has a its 

00:03:33.110 --> 00:03:37.220
 king is as I say practically 

00:03:34.760 --> 00:03:38.780
 impossible and the gun I think he has is very 

00:03:37.220 --> 00:03:41.000
 pretty so we take advantage of it 

00:03:38.780 --> 00:03:42.740
 because as I say unless the enemy 

00:03:41.000 --> 00:03:45.190
 have flash or many skills 

00:03:42.740 --> 00:03:48.940
 escape is really going to be impossible 

00:03:45.190 --> 00:03:51.010
 get away from the gun that or from a slip 

00:03:48.940 --> 00:03:52.990
 and speaking of banks this character 

00:03:51.010 --> 00:03:54.940
 has a very important video because I've 

00:03:52.990 --> 00:03:57.460
 reached level 6 along with the r 

00:03:54.940 --> 00:03:59.350
 logically we are going to have a video like 

00:03:57.460 --> 00:04:00.940
 I say very easy because as soon as we 

00:03:59.350 --> 00:04:03.490
 let's throw the r we will achieve a life 

00:04:00.940 --> 00:04:05.920
 pretty good and what if our allies 

00:04:03.490 --> 00:04:07.690
 they are relatively good we are going to be able 

00:04:05.920 --> 00:04:11.130
 as I say release very easy and take us 

00:04:07.690 --> 00:04:13.600
 deaths as I say relatively free 

00:04:11.130 --> 00:04:15.160
 another thing also quite important and 

00:04:13.600 --> 00:04:17.019
 is that when our allies have 

00:04:15.160 --> 00:04:18.600
 gone to record either to recover to 

00:04:17.019 --> 00:04:20.650
 buy or anything like that 

00:04:18.600 --> 00:04:22.630
 we should take advantage of 

00:04:20.650 --> 00:04:24.910
 form the cv with the farmer that is in 

00:04:22.630 --> 00:04:26.950
 line logically online we will form 

00:04:24.910 --> 00:04:29.980
 much faster and much better our q 

00:04:26.950 --> 00:04:31.420
 that in the jungle so as I say very 

00:04:29.980 --> 00:04:33.280
 important when we have to put up with 

00:04:31.420 --> 00:04:34.780
 a line the farmar the cv for well 

00:04:33.280 --> 00:04:36.910
 increase our year at the time of 

00:04:34.780 --> 00:04:38.830
 lasting five 

00:04:36.910 --> 00:04:41.350
 also say that this character is a 

00:04:38.830 --> 00:04:43.540
 he shoots expert turrets because with the damage 

00:04:41.350 --> 00:04:44.920
 of the q we will affect turrets so 

00:04:43.540 --> 00:04:46.900
 as you see every time we activate 

00:04:44.920 --> 00:04:48.490
 the q and we give a turret 

00:04:46.900 --> 00:04:50.430
 we will remove a tripping of life enough 

00:04:48.490 --> 00:04:53.889
 quite interesting so as I say 

00:04:50.430 --> 00:04:56.650
 when your allies want to walk 

00:04:53.889 --> 00:05:00.350
 and there are no enemies in between is going to be 

00:04:56.650 --> 00:05:02.660
 really easy to destroy a turret 

00:05:00.350 --> 00:05:04.250
 and the last tips is how and when 

00:05:02.660 --> 00:05:06.200
 use every skill we are going to throw 

00:05:04.250 --> 00:05:07.850
 for the q and q to use it whenever 

00:05:06.200 --> 00:05:09.410
 you have it available to do the 

00:05:07.850 --> 00:05:12.290
 greater damage from our enemies I think that 

00:05:09.410 --> 00:05:14.180
 does not have much more the w always 

00:05:12.290 --> 00:05:15.560
 to the enemy qarni in order to slow down the 

00:05:14.180 --> 00:05:17.720
 and slow down movement 

00:05:15.560 --> 00:05:19.550
 attack speed so it's very 

00:05:17.720 --> 00:05:22.100
 important and we will achieve it quite 

00:05:19.550 --> 00:05:24.170
 carry enemy life remember that removes 

00:05:22.100 --> 00:05:25.610
 armor so if we use it very 

00:05:24.170 --> 00:05:27.740
 well we will get to remove the armor to 

00:05:25.610 --> 00:05:30.680
 all the enemies so as I say very 

00:05:27.740 --> 00:05:32.090
 important how and when to throw it and the r 

00:05:30.680 --> 00:05:33.890
 Well, simply use it to 

00:05:32.090 --> 00:05:36.170
 hold on and jara shear a little bit to 

00:05:33.890 --> 00:05:37.880
 our enemies is to say as soon as we 

00:05:36.170 --> 00:05:40.550
 we miss the ruse we will have more life 

00:05:37.880 --> 00:05:42.290
 we are going to have an aura that is really going to 

00:05:40.550 --> 00:05:45.020
 try a lot when it comes to inks 

00:05:42.290 --> 00:05:47.840
 and there's not much else I think these are 

00:05:45.020 --> 00:05:50.510
 all the advice I hope you have 

00:05:47.840 --> 00:05:54.100
 liked this guide english naxos guide and 

00:05:50.510 --> 00:05:54.100
 See you in the following videos 

00:06:06.800 --> 00:06:09.800
