all right so I tried to come back again
and<00:01:48.750> it's<00:01:49.020> seriously<00:01:49.500> just<00:01:49.829> the<00:01:50.460> crack<00:01:50.670> the

00:01:50.899 --> 00:01:50.909 
and it's seriously just the crack the

00:01:50.909 --> 00:01:53.270 
and it's seriously just the crack the
crack<00:01:51.030> whores<00:01:51.329> so<00:01:52.110> I<00:01:52.140> don't<00:01:52.470> think<00:01:52.649> that<00:01:52.770> ICP

00:01:53.270 --> 00:01:53.280 
crack whores so I don't think that ICP

00:01:53.280 --> 00:01:55.700 
crack whores so I don't think that ICP
is<00:01:53.310> actually<00:01:54.060> in<00:01:54.210> the<00:01:54.360> game<00:01:54.570> but<00:01:55.110> I<00:01:55.140> will<00:01:55.380> say

00:01:55.700 --> 00:01:55.710 
is actually in the game but I will say

00:01:55.710 --> 00:01:58.550 
is actually in the game but I will say
that<00:01:55.740> they<00:01:56.130> have<00:01:56.240> their<00:01:57.240> face<00:01:57.540> paint<00:01:57.869> they

00:01:58.550 --> 00:01:58.560 
that they have their face paint they

00:01:58.560 --> 00:02:01.160 
that they have their face paint they
have<00:01:58.829> their<00:01:59.130> logos<00:01:59.640> and<00:02:00.000> even<00:02:00.570> I<00:02:00.689> think<00:02:00.719> their

00:02:01.160 --> 00:02:01.170 
have their logos and even I think their

00:02:01.170 --> 00:02:03.590 
have their logos and even I think their
music<00:02:01.649> in<00:02:01.799> this<00:02:01.950> game<00:02:02.219> so<00:02:02.549> Rockstar<00:02:03.030> must<00:02:03.390> have

00:02:03.590 --> 00:02:03.600 
music in this game so Rockstar must have

00:02:03.600 --> 00:02:06.350 
music in this game so Rockstar must have
paid<00:02:03.840> them<00:02:04.110> some<00:02:05.009> kind<00:02:05.280> of<00:02:05.430> money<00:02:05.670> to<00:02:06.240> actually

00:02:06.350 --> 00:02:06.360 
paid them some kind of money to actually

00:02:06.360 --> 00:02:08.270 
paid them some kind of money to actually
