I<00:01:44.950> know<00:01:45.040> that<00:01:45.370> the<00:01:45.490> white<00:01:45.670> coat<00:01:45.940> symbolizes

00:01:46.710 --> 00:01:46.720 
I know that the white coat symbolizes

00:01:46.720 --> 00:01:48.690 
I know that the white coat symbolizes
going<00:01:47.020> into<00:01:47.230> the<00:01:47.350> medical<00:01:47.500> field<00:01:47.800> and<00:01:48.430> what<00:01:48.670> I

00:01:48.690 --> 00:01:48.700 
going into the medical field and what I

00:01:48.700 --> 00:01:51.090 
going into the medical field and what I
will<00:01:48.940> be<00:01:49.030> practicing<00:01:49.630> but<00:01:50.260> to<00:01:50.440> me<00:01:50.560> I<00:01:50.590> think<00:01:50.770> it

00:01:51.090 --> 00:01:51.100 
will be practicing but to me I think it

00:01:51.100 --> 00:01:53.520 
will be practicing but to me I think it
symbolizes<00:01:51.340> also<00:01:52.330> what<00:01:52.570> my<00:01:52.690> family<00:01:53.200> and

00:01:53.520 --> 00:01:53.530
