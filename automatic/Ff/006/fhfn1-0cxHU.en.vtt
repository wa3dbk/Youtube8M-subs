it's<00:03:11.510> from<00:03:11.690> previous<00:03:12.170> layouts<00:03:12.560> I've<00:03:12.830> built<00:03:13.450> if

00:03:14.440 --> 00:03:14.450 
it's from previous layouts I've built if

00:03:14.450 --> 00:03:18.069 
it's from previous layouts I've built if
you<00:03:14.959> get<00:03:15.799> it<00:03:16.010> slightly<00:03:16.430> wet<00:03:16.760> and<00:03:17.750> you<00:03:17.840> spray

00:03:18.069 --> 00:03:18.079 
you get it slightly wet and you spray

00:03:18.079 --> 00:03:21.699 
you get it slightly wet and you spray
the<00:03:18.140> foam<00:03:18.440> on<00:03:18.739> it<00:03:18.950> expands<00:03:19.760> even<00:03:20.060> more<00:03:20.380> so<00:03:21.380> you

00:03:21.699 --> 00:03:21.709 
the foam on it expands even more so you

00:03:21.709 --> 00:03:24.490 
the foam on it expands even more so you
use<00:03:21.920> a<00:03:21.950> less<00:03:22.250> foam<00:03:22.519> get<00:03:22.880> more<00:03:23.120> out<00:03:23.269> there<00:03:23.510> so

00:03:24.490 --> 00:03:24.500 
use a less foam get more out there so

00:03:24.500 --> 00:03:26.229 
use a less foam get more out there so
you've<00:03:24.620> gotten<00:03:24.859> lost<00:03:25.220> home<00:03:25.459> left<00:03:25.730> for<00:03:26.060> your
