00:01:55.569 --> 00:01:55.579 
when you land you have to jump for some

00:01:55.579 --> 00:01:58.539 
when you land you have to jump for some
strange<00:01:56.149> reason<00:01:56.469> whenever<00:01:57.469> you<00:01:57.619> get<00:01:57.859> hit<00:01:58.159> by

one of those things you just stop you
just<00:02:01.849> lose<00:02:02.270> the<00:02:02.539> ability<00:02:02.599> to<00:02:02.929> move<00:02:03.139> it<00:02:04.099> doesn't

00:02:04.419 --> 00:02:04.429 
just lose the ability to move it doesn't

moving keep on sprinting all right 148
you're<00:02:37.940> gonna<00:02:38.090> get<00:02:38.209> back<00:02:38.360> to<00:02:38.480> the<00:02:38.569> middle<00:02:38.840> go

00:02:39.090 --> 00:02:39.100 
you're gonna get back to the middle go

00:02:39.100 --> 00:02:42.400 
you're gonna get back to the middle go
back<00:02:40.100> to<00:02:40.250> the<00:02:40.370> very<00:02:40.760> middle<00:02:41.090> and<00:02:41.600> see<00:02:42.290> what

00:02:42.400 --> 00:02:42.410 
back to the very middle and see what

00:02:42.410 --> 00:02:44.080 
back to the very middle and see what
path<00:02:42.590> we<00:02:42.770> could<00:02:42.890> take<00:02:43.069> you<00:02:43.459> know<00:02:43.489> right<00:02:43.850> here

00:02:44.080 --> 00:02:44.090 
path we could take you know right here

00:02:44.090 --> 00:02:48.009 
path we could take you know right here
because<00:02:44.420> it's<00:02:44.569> closest<00:02:45.489> double<00:02:46.489> jump<00:02:47.019> single

00:02:48.009 --> 00:02:48.019 
because it's closest double jump single

00:02:48.019 --> 00:02:50.170 
because it's closest double jump single
single<00:02:48.739> jump<00:02:48.980> so<00:02:49.489> there's<00:02:49.670> some<00:02:49.790> of<00:02:49.820> these<00:02:49.940> you

00:02:50.170 --> 00:02:50.180 
single jump so there's some of these you

00:02:50.180 --> 00:02:52.060 
single jump so there's some of these you
have<00:02:50.300> to<00:02:50.390> do<00:02:50.510> single<00:02:50.720> jumps<00:02:51.080> like<00:02:51.470> this<00:02:51.650> double

00:02:52.060 --> 00:02:52.070 
have to do single jumps like this double

00:02:52.070 --> 00:02:54.610 
have to do single jumps like this double
jump<00:02:52.280> double<00:02:53.030> jump<00:02:53.180> that's<00:02:53.959> the<00:02:54.110> double<00:02:54.350> jump

00:02:54.610 --> 00:02:54.620 
jump double jump that's the double jump

00:02:54.620 --> 00:02:56.140 
jump double jump that's the double jump
you<00:02:54.980> should<00:02:55.130> be<00:02:55.220> out<00:02:55.310> of<00:02:55.340> gauge<00:02:55.550> have<00:02:55.940> been<00:02:56.090> a

00:02:56.140 --> 00:02:56.150 
you should be out of gauge have been a

00:02:56.150 --> 00:02:58.210 
you should be out of gauge have been a
gap<00:02:56.330> it<00:02:56.480> is<00:02:56.540> we<00:02:56.750> won<00:02:56.930> the<00:02:57.050> clearly<00:02:57.410> single<00:02:58.040> jump

00:02:58.210 --> 00:02:58.220 
gap it is we won the clearly single jump

00:02:58.220 --> 00:02:59.890 
gap it is we won the clearly single jump
while<00:02:58.850> you're<00:02:59.030> sprinting<00:02:59.300> your<00:02:59.540> net<00:02:59.690> do<00:02:59.810> it

00:02:59.890 --> 00:02:59.900 
while you're sprinting your net do it

00:02:59.900 --> 00:03:01.900 
while you're sprinting your net do it
once<00:03:00.110> so<00:03:00.590> you'll<00:03:00.709> be<00:03:00.800> fine<00:03:01.010> just<00:03:01.310> keep

00:03:01.900 --> 00:03:01.910 
once so you'll be fine just keep

00:03:01.910 --> 00:03:04.840 
once so you'll be fine just keep
sprinting<00:03:02.630> do<00:03:02.870> not<00:03:03.050> stop<00:03:03.380> sprinting<00:03:04.250> that<00:03:04.730> is

00:03:04.840 --> 00:03:04.850 
sprinting do not stop sprinting that is

00:03:04.850 --> 00:03:08.050 
sprinting do not stop sprinting that is
my<00:03:05.120> best<00:03:05.750> advice<00:03:05.930> go<00:03:06.290> if<00:03:06.860> you<00:03:07.010> stop<00:03:07.280> you're
