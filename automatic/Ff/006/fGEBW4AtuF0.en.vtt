00:00:10.900 --> 00:00:15.039
 so hello together today is about it 

00:00:13.370 --> 00:00:17.390
 how to lay power line 

00:00:15.039 --> 00:00:19.279
 That's why we have today 

00:00:17.390 --> 00:00:21.560
 finally caught her as she got the 

00:00:19.279 --> 00:00:23.509
 wants to relocate electricity for her house 

00:00:21.560 --> 00:00:25.550
 all you need is one 

00:00:23.509 --> 00:00:28.460
 generator and the corresponding cables 

00:00:25.550 --> 00:00:30.919
 there is tutorial from my water 

00:00:28.460 --> 00:00:32.870
 knows different parts of the line 

00:00:30.919 --> 00:00:36.440
 is real are the same parts here 

00:00:32.870 --> 00:00:40.129
 easy cable city water line at 

00:00:36.440 --> 00:00:41.870
 whose and the first one was now on 

00:00:40.129 --> 00:00:51.199
 best a generator where wo him 

00:00:41.870 --> 00:00:52.969
 wanted to have it now it recommends itself 

00:00:51.199 --> 00:00:55.219
 few units of gasoline in there too 

00:00:52.969 --> 00:00:57.499
 clap because as soon as he runs he starts 

00:00:55.219 --> 00:01:00.440
 to light up and the cards light up 

00:00:57.499 --> 00:01:04.729
 So you also see one like that 

00:01:00.440 --> 00:01:07.340
 Connection must have united first 

00:01:04.729 --> 00:01:11.950
 you now in ziethen cards with the part 

00:01:07.340 --> 00:01:14.420
 connect here from the generator 

00:01:11.950 --> 00:01:16.729
 that you see that is the straight cable 

00:01:14.420 --> 00:01:19.130
 here and now it will be cable 

00:01:16.729 --> 00:01:21.920
 yellow lights that means that stream on it 

00:01:19.130 --> 00:01:23.600
 that is the connection pastor and now 

00:01:21.920 --> 00:01:26.210
 Can you actually do the management like that 

00:01:23.600 --> 00:01:30.280
 pull where I wanted to have her 

00:01:26.210 --> 00:01:30.280
 Place the viewpoint after a socket 

00:01:32.840 --> 00:01:38.210
 We now have the line from above 

00:01:35.710 --> 00:01:39.560
 here by the blanket that is like with the 

00:01:38.210 --> 00:01:42.229
 You can go through the water pipes 

00:01:39.560 --> 00:01:44.659
 build all the walls and you 

00:01:42.229 --> 00:01:46.310
 You can also walk by it as you see 

00:01:44.659 --> 00:01:47.780
 the same goes for your cinemas also 

00:01:46.310 --> 00:01:50.619
 itself is not grieving that their 

00:01:47.780 --> 00:01:54.140
 to do something with the cables 

00:01:50.619 --> 00:01:56.060
 we have the cables here now 

00:01:54.140 --> 00:01:57.829
 misplaced because we are here afterwards 

00:01:56.060 --> 00:02:01.640
 electrical appliances want what he wants 

00:01:57.829 --> 00:02:04.640
 Now is the need for such a power outlet 

00:02:01.640 --> 00:02:07.759
 also knows and representative force and 

00:02:04.640 --> 00:02:09.380
 in the circumference of this socket you know 

00:02:07.759 --> 00:02:10.069
 after that all electrical appliances 

00:02:09.380 --> 00:02:11.630
 put up 

00:02:10.069 --> 00:02:13.760
 Here you see, even if so spark 

00:02:11.630 --> 00:02:16.660
 sprout that means that the stream 

00:02:13.760 --> 00:02:20.360
 is and the hard radius of 

00:02:16.660 --> 00:02:22.340
 probably 15 to 20 meters where he 

00:02:20.360 --> 00:02:24.650
 now in orbit electronic devices 

00:02:22.340 --> 00:02:29.989
 could and then they will 

00:02:24.650 --> 00:02:32.900
 automatically powered by electricity example 

00:02:29.989 --> 00:02:35.329
 here this lamp is here 

00:02:32.900 --> 00:02:38.139
 message has that is called stream 

00:02:35.329 --> 00:02:40.970
 Connected and zapp she lights up the 

00:02:38.139 --> 00:02:44.810
 Power consumption is one at the moment 

00:02:40.970 --> 00:02:46.220
 unit of gasoline per life hour so 

00:02:44.810 --> 00:02:48.250
 regardless of how fast the time is up 

00:02:46.220 --> 00:02:50.930
 your server is running you can 

00:02:48.250 --> 00:02:51.530
 units gasoline indirect hours around 

00:02:50.930 --> 00:02:54.109
 bills 

00:02:51.530 --> 00:02:56.209
 it does not matter how many 

00:02:54.109 --> 00:02:58.730
 electronic devices connected her 

00:02:56.209 --> 00:03:02.000
 has from now only this lamp is running 

00:02:58.730 --> 00:03:03.410
 or the lamp that stands here and if 

00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:05.750
 also fridge is there and so on 

00:03:03.410 --> 00:03:07.669
 does not matter if 1 or 1000 

00:03:05.750 --> 00:03:11.599
 electrical objects of 

00:03:07.669 --> 00:03:13.160
 Power consumption is always the same thing like that 

00:03:11.599 --> 00:03:15.019
 It was from me with my little tutorial 

00:03:13.160 --> 00:03:16.519
 as well as electricity I hope that has 

00:03:15.019 --> 00:03:19.669
 helped you if so please 

00:03:16.519 --> 00:03:21.940
 make comments and see you next 

00:03:19.669 --> 00:03:21.940
 times 

00:03:23.080 --> 00:03:29.250
 v go canada go gaza
