00:00:10.440 --> 00:00:15.299
 then pushed back the cuticles 

00:00:12.750 --> 00:00:17.220
 well you can do it with the flat end 

00:00:15.299 --> 00:00:19.140
 from the orange stick or how I do it 

00:00:17.220 --> 00:00:22.110
 which is a tool for cuticles 

00:00:19.140 --> 00:00:24.180
 metallic that I acquired in wing coins was 

00:00:22.110 --> 00:00:26.310
 remove carefully leaving the nail 

00:00:24.180 --> 00:00:28.619
 wider and it will be easier to glaze 

00:00:26.310 --> 00:00:30.300
 It is important that the cuticle is 

00:00:28.619 --> 00:00:32.219
 clean and free of waste before 

00:00:30.300 --> 00:00:35.040
 Apply the gel enamel because if not 

00:00:32.219 --> 00:00:37.230
 can decrease its adherence with a 

00:00:35.040 --> 00:00:39.809
 thin file thickness I give the desired shape 

00:00:37.230 --> 00:00:42.360
 to the nails you have to put them more or less 

00:00:39.809 --> 00:00:44.070
 to the same size all but maybe to 

00:00:42.360 --> 00:00:45.629
 someone will pass him like me 

00:00:44.070 --> 00:00:47.280
 have them weak they split me with 

00:00:45.629 --> 00:00:49.409
 ease so one is very 

00:00:47.280 --> 00:00:51.870
 short and others much longer 

00:00:49.409 --> 00:00:54.089
 once the nails are filed with the polisher 

00:00:51.870 --> 00:00:56.670
 pull or lightly all the nails to 

00:00:54.089 --> 00:00:58.530
 Remove a little without passing the shine 

00:00:56.670 --> 00:01:00.719
 of the nail when we have 

00:00:58.530 --> 00:01:03.600
 polishing you have to remove any residue 

00:01:00.719 --> 00:01:05.190
 of nail dust with a skewer yo 

00:01:03.600 --> 00:01:07.110
 for example and how are you seeing in the 

00:01:05.190 --> 00:01:09.299
 video one of my files has a kind 

00:01:07.110 --> 00:01:12.409
 of pelito on the other hand to clean 

00:01:09.299 --> 00:01:12.409
 this rest 

00:01:13.510 --> 00:01:20.620
 the first product that I'm going to use is 

00:01:16.480 --> 00:01:24.550
 the premier gel applied a thin layer 

00:01:20.620 --> 00:01:27.730
 All nails once applied 

00:01:24.550 --> 00:01:30.360
 will put his hand on the lamp for 30 

00:01:27.730 --> 00:01:30.360
 seconds 

00:01:34.670 --> 00:01:39.650
 then applied a thin base layer 

00:01:37.310 --> 00:01:42.140
 coat without touching the cuticle or the skin 

00:01:39.650 --> 00:01:44.330
 around the nail you should not touch 

00:01:42.140 --> 00:01:46.850
 the cuticle for the simple reason that 

00:01:44.330 --> 00:01:49.460
 When the nail starts to grow it can be 

00:01:46.850 --> 00:01:51.229
 lifting the enameling must be covered 

00:01:49.460 --> 00:01:54.320
 completely the tip of the natural nail 

00:01:51.229 --> 00:01:56.420
 passing the brush over that area if it is 

00:01:54.320 --> 00:01:58.549
 necessary to remove the excess product 

00:01:56.420 --> 00:02:00.320
 in the cuticle area sara with the 

00:01:58.549 --> 00:02:02.780
 tip of the orange stick before 

00:02:00.320 --> 00:02:04.640
 insert your hand into the lamp in this 

00:02:02.780 --> 00:02:08.530
 case you will put your hand in the 

00:02:04.640 --> 00:02:08.530
 Lamp for 30 seconds 

00:02:11.069 --> 00:02:15.540
 first I do with the brush finished in 

00:02:13.560 --> 00:02:18.120
 metal tip on the white part of the 

00:02:15.540 --> 00:02:20.400
 nail for french manicure covering 

00:02:18.120 --> 00:02:21.650
 completely the tip of the natural nail 

00:02:20.400 --> 00:02:24.480
 to keep me from getting up 

00:02:21.650 --> 00:02:26.609
 later I try not to put much 

00:02:24.480 --> 00:02:29.879
 product on the nail so that it stays 

00:02:26.609 --> 00:02:31.709
 more natural and not bulky 

00:02:29.879 --> 00:02:33.750
 I do this step first but I know that 

00:02:31.709 --> 00:02:36.359
 many do the reverse first the 

00:02:33.750 --> 00:02:38.340
 rosita after the white and finally 

00:02:36.359 --> 00:02:40.349
 again the rose 

00:02:38.340 --> 00:02:42.989
 when I have already applied the white in all 

00:02:40.349 --> 00:02:45.500
 the nails I let dry in the lamp 60 

00:02:42.989 --> 00:02:45.500
 seconds 

00:02:45.840 --> 00:02:50.760
 then I give myself a pink capita 

00:02:48.959 --> 00:02:53.330
 by all the nails and enter the 

00:02:50.760 --> 00:02:56.069
 hands on the lamp for 60 seconds 

00:02:53.330 --> 00:02:58.410
 the reason why I only give one 

00:02:56.069 --> 00:03:01.230
 layer of pink is because I like it like that the 

00:02:58.410 --> 00:03:03.209
 final result it is said that by applying 

00:03:01.230 --> 00:03:06.420
 two layers the glaze is more 

00:03:03.209 --> 00:03:08.310
 uniform and it lasts longer however to me 

00:03:06.420 --> 00:03:09.989
 It lasts exactly the same with one that 

00:03:08.310 --> 00:03:14.330
 with two layers and uniform I also 

00:03:09.989 --> 00:03:14.330
 you will see the final result 

00:03:14.720 --> 00:03:20.150
 finally give a thin uniform layer 

00:03:17.510 --> 00:03:22.820
 by all the nails of the health or code 

00:03:20.150 --> 00:03:24.920
 in order to seal the rosita and the white of 

00:03:22.820 --> 00:03:26.690
 French manicure and give a shine 

00:03:24.920 --> 00:03:29.660
 extra to the nail 

00:03:26.690 --> 00:03:32.420
 mine is basic I touch at 2 in one but 

00:03:29.660 --> 00:03:34.280
 there are them separately and it will be introduced 

00:03:32.420 --> 00:03:37.380
 each hand on the lamp with a duration 

00:03:34.280 --> 00:03:40.800
 30 seconds each 

00:03:37.380 --> 00:03:43.320
 once all the steps in 

00:03:40.800 --> 00:03:45.690
 a mini wipe soaked it in clean air 

00:03:43.320 --> 00:03:49.620
 to remove the excess gel from the 

00:03:45.690 --> 00:03:52.550
 nails do not use cotton disc because this 

00:03:49.620 --> 00:03:55.340
 can leave traces on the nails 

00:03:52.550 --> 00:03:57.650
 and finally the nails are done to the 

00:03:55.340 --> 00:04:00.770
 French manicure with permanent enamel 

00:03:57.650 --> 00:04:03.560
 if instead of being a French manicurist 

00:04:00.770 --> 00:04:05.270
 you want the step with a specific color 

00:04:03.560 --> 00:04:08.000
 in which he applied the white and the 

00:04:05.270 --> 00:04:10.850
 Rosita would exchange it for two layers of 

00:04:08.000 --> 00:04:13.180
 desired color by others everything would be 

00:04:10.850 --> 00:04:13.180
 same
