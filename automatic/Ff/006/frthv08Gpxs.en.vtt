00:00:05.810 --> 00:00:08.319
 do not 

00:00:23.820 --> 00:00:27.869
 taking advantage of the first official trailer 

00:00:25.590 --> 00:00:29.760
 of call of duty cost offered in the 

00:00:27.869 --> 00:00:33.080
 presentation of the xbox one console 

00:00:29.760 --> 00:00:35.579
 we remember the first call of duty 

00:00:33.080 --> 00:00:37.370
 infinity ward study that was founded with 

00:00:35.579 --> 00:00:40.140
 former members of the 'medal of honor' series 

00:00:37.370 --> 00:00:43.170
 burst all the sales lists with 

00:00:40.140 --> 00:00:46.559
 the first call of dutty developed 

00:00:43.170 --> 00:00:48.150
 for pc in the year 2003 this shooter in 

00:00:46.559 --> 00:00:50.760
 first person set in the second 

00:00:48.150 --> 00:00:52.980
 World War offered us a campaign 

00:00:50.760 --> 00:00:55.710
 divided into three different passages of the 

00:00:52.980 --> 00:00:58.890
 I play the American campaign the 

00:00:55.710 --> 00:01:00.719
 English campaign and the Russian campaign in 

00:00:58.890 --> 00:01:03.090
 that we were controlling the soldiers myself and 

00:01:00.719 --> 00:01:05.129
 king sergeant jack evans and the 

00:01:03.090 --> 00:01:08.130
 Sergeant Alex Ivanovic 

00:01:05.129 --> 00:01:09.810
 Voronin respectively from his 

00:01:08.130 --> 00:01:11.490
 shoot with the beauty a 

00:01:09.810 --> 00:01:14.009
 became the war shooter to follow 

00:01:11.490 --> 00:01:16.770
 setting the course and heading the 

00:01:14.009 --> 00:01:18.330
 resurface from the shooters I started at each 

00:01:16.770 --> 00:01:20.280
 passage had its own 

00:01:18.330 --> 00:01:22.650
 ambience and missions 

00:01:20.280 --> 00:01:24.390
 the cinematographic setting was one 

00:01:22.650 --> 00:01:26.909
 of the highlights of the game 

00:01:24.390 --> 00:01:29.250
 although the best was the rhythm and 

00:01:26.909 --> 00:01:31.650
 variety of missions that we were living 

00:01:29.250 --> 00:01:33.840
 the war proposal was very 

00:01:31.650 --> 00:01:35.549
 credible thanks to some situations a lot 

00:01:33.840 --> 00:01:38.550
 more logical and more behavior 

00:01:35.549 --> 00:01:41.520
 credible of the characters based on 

00:01:38.550 --> 00:01:42.899
 real passages of history attack 

00:01:41.520 --> 00:01:45.360
 from the flanks while others 

00:01:42.899 --> 00:01:47.220
 comrades assaulted positions create 

00:01:45.360 --> 00:01:48.810
 distractions clean the area of 

00:01:47.220 --> 00:01:52.049
 enemies perform missions of 

00:01:48.810 --> 00:01:54.960
 sniper using vehicles these were 

00:01:52.049 --> 00:01:58.080
 only some of them we always perform 

00:01:54.960 --> 00:02:01.409
 missions as part of a team of 

00:01:58.080 --> 00:02:03.179
 a squad 24 epic missions the 

00:02:01.409 --> 00:02:05.429
 individual slope including the day 

00:02:03.179 --> 00:02:07.740
 of the Russian charge in Stalingrad and the 

00:02:05.429 --> 00:02:09.509
 battle for berlin and a multiplayer that 

00:02:07.740 --> 00:02:13.459
 offered confrontations between the axis and 

00:02:09.509 --> 00:02:16.080
 allies made up this spectacular south 

00:02:13.459 --> 00:02:18.569
 in the year 2008 there was an excellent 

00:02:16.080 --> 00:02:21.180
 hd update of the game that is 

00:02:18.569 --> 00:02:24.329
 possible to buy for example on xbox live 

00:02:21.180 --> 00:02:26.690
 for xbox 360 version to which 

00:02:24.329 --> 00:02:29.750
 these images belong 

00:02:26.690 --> 00:02:32.090
 in the year 2004 callofduty also arrived 

00:02:29.750 --> 00:02:34.880
 to the xbox and playstation 2 consoles 

00:02:32.090 --> 00:02:37.640
 gamecube although in a different version 

00:02:34.880 --> 00:02:40.280
 halfway between a port and a 

00:02:37.640 --> 00:02:42.650
 spin-off some missions were very 

00:02:40.280 --> 00:02:44.810
 similar others varied and were included 

00:02:42.650 --> 00:02:46.370
 totally new ones too 

00:02:44.810 --> 00:02:49.400
 they changed the characters to control 

00:02:46.370 --> 00:02:52.070
 going from 3 to 62 for each of the 

00:02:49.400 --> 00:02:55.070
 three passages or respective campaigns the 

00:02:52.070 --> 00:02:56.930
 American the English and the Russian 

00:02:55.070 --> 00:02:59.150
 this version made by the spark 

00:02:56.930 --> 00:03:01.270
 unlimited was not able to reach the 

00:02:59.150 --> 00:03:03.980
 excellence of the original version of pc 

00:03:01.270 --> 00:03:05.870
 graphics just right little enemies 

00:03:03.980 --> 00:03:08.540
 smart some flaws in the 

00:03:05.870 --> 00:03:11.480
 control difficulty too variable and 

00:03:08.540 --> 00:03:13.550
 rather monotonous missions we could 

00:03:11.480 --> 00:03:15.260
 say that this is the worst delivery for 

00:03:13.550 --> 00:03:18.110
 console of all known in the 

00:03:15.260 --> 00:03:20.150
 franchise aspect that are solved 

00:03:18.110 --> 00:03:22.640
 subsequent deliveries that have known 

00:03:20.150 --> 00:03:24.140
 harvest good results and faithful 

00:03:22.640 --> 00:03:26.540
 followers 

00:03:24.140 --> 00:03:28.700

00:03:28.700 --> 00:03:32.780
 memory regarding games that we have 

00:03:30.290 --> 00:03:35.090
 analyzed electors in sessions we want 

00:03:32.780 --> 00:03:38.480

00:03:35.090 --> 00:03:40.310

00:03:38.480 --> 00:03:41.630
