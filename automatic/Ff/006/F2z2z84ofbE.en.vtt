00:00:06.299 --> 00:00:11.910
 edition of wwe you who have fortin 

00:00:09.780 --> 00:00:16.109
 we bought the xbox version 

00:00:11.910 --> 00:00:19.250
 360 came from this Amazon 

00:00:16.109 --> 00:00:21.570
 beautiful packaging that indeed 

00:00:19.250 --> 00:00:24.869
 includes a series of 

00:00:21.570 --> 00:00:26.820
 particularly interesting gadgets for 

00:00:24.869 --> 00:00:30.890
 all wrestling fans e 

00:00:26.820 --> 00:00:35.070
 especially for those who appreciate this 

00:00:30.890 --> 00:00:38.700
 sports entertainer which is a undertaker 

00:00:35.070 --> 00:00:44.250
 of the most long-lived wreslers in the history of 

00:00:38.700 --> 00:00:46.289
 this of this sport entertainment la 

00:00:44.250 --> 00:00:49.200
 rather light box once 

00:00:46.289 --> 00:00:51.420
 open we find this other inside 

00:00:49.200 --> 00:00:56.460
 This time, however, a box of shaped metal 

00:00:51.420 --> 00:01:00.539
 entirely black coffin with this screen printing 

00:00:56.460 --> 00:01:05.040
 on the cover of the di 

00:01:00.539 --> 00:01:07.320
 undertaker the boxes rather light 

00:01:05.040 --> 00:01:09.840
 because inside they are almost contained 

00:01:07.320 --> 00:01:12.390
 all digital content almost all 

00:01:09.840 --> 00:01:14.790
 things to download even if it's not missing 

00:01:12.390 --> 00:01:16.950
 some fun surprise then 

00:01:14.790 --> 00:01:21.930
 let's see among other things that the 

00:01:16.950 --> 00:01:24.180
 serigraphy and in relief and therefore it is 

00:01:21.930 --> 00:01:26.009
 decorated we say the box with this 

00:01:24.180 --> 00:01:28.140
 symbol 

00:01:26.009 --> 00:01:32.100
 after which this is the game the game 

00:01:28.140 --> 00:01:35.400
 as you can see includes the the character 

00:01:32.100 --> 00:01:37.140
 this is the ultimate warrior downloadable 

00:01:35.400 --> 00:01:41.490
 instead the back where we can see a 

00:01:37.140 --> 00:01:44.790
 smiling and dazzling hulk hogan in in 

00:01:41.490 --> 00:01:48.270
 full form that was a bit of a picture 

00:01:44.790 --> 00:01:51.780
 repertoire but definitely mythical here 

00:01:48.270 --> 00:01:57.930
 instead we find a photograph 

00:01:51.780 --> 00:01:59.840
 autographed by daller teker himself then 

00:01:57.930 --> 00:02:03.829
 we find a 

00:01:59.840 --> 00:02:06.020
 a sticker this is a cover for the 

00:02:03.829 --> 00:02:08.690
 own controller is a sticker us 

00:02:06.020 --> 00:02:11.090
 we usually don't apply stickers on 

00:02:08.690 --> 00:02:13.420
 our controllers, however, for those who wish 

00:02:11.090 --> 00:02:16.400
 there is this possibility 

00:02:13.420 --> 00:02:18.590
 from the inside we also find the dlc 

00:02:16.400 --> 00:02:22.599
 downloadable to customize 

00:02:18.590 --> 00:02:22.599
 undertaker in its bad ass version 

00:02:22.670 --> 00:02:29.989
 and then we find a very interesting DVD 

00:02:26.780 --> 00:02:34.760
 almost three hours by the way he does 

00:02:29.989 --> 00:02:36.380

00:02:34.760 --> 00:02:40.459

00:02:58.940 --> 00:03:07.940
 consecutive and after that you can 

00:03:04.250 --> 00:03:10.370
 see another 45 other 35 sorry 

00:03:07.940 --> 00:03:12.170
 minutes of presentation in which it comes 

00:03:10.370 --> 00:03:14.620
 made a sort of summary of this 

00:03:12.170 --> 00:03:17.150
 incredible story 

00:03:14.620 --> 00:03:18.950
