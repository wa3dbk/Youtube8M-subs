00:00:00.890 --> 00:00:07.230
 hello together and welcome to my 

00:00:03.419 --> 00:00:11.880
 Today I turn my first video 

00:00:07.230 --> 00:00:13.590
 here for youtube and that's what it's about 

00:00:11.880 --> 00:00:16.109
 Let me call you five things 

00:00:13.590 --> 00:00:16.890
 why would we go for breakfast? 

00:00:16.109 --> 00:00:22.470
 should eat 

00:00:16.890 --> 00:00:25.019
 We'll all start number one sooner 

00:00:22.470 --> 00:00:27.720
 tomorrow it is so that the body on 

00:00:25.019 --> 00:00:32.130
 strongest detoxifies essmann said 

00:00:27.720 --> 00:00:35.070
 between 7 and 11 12 o'clock there is the 

00:00:32.130 --> 00:00:36.390
 body really busy yes that 

00:00:35.070 --> 00:00:39.809
 whole poisons from the body 

00:00:36.390 --> 00:00:43.760
 to say goodbye if you can prove something 

00:00:39.809 --> 00:00:46.739
 make for huge portions or 

00:00:43.760 --> 00:00:48.629
 Simple heavy food is so 

00:00:46.739 --> 00:00:50.840
 The bbu of the body just long 

00:00:48.629 --> 00:00:53.879
 they need to digest 

00:00:50.840 --> 00:00:55.949
 he just swears the body in the 

00:00:53.879 --> 00:00:58.440
 whole thing so where you really 

00:00:55.949 --> 00:01:00.539
 Much more energy then for digestion 

00:00:58.440 --> 00:01:03.300
 needed then to clean the body 

00:01:00.539 --> 00:01:06.119
 and in the long run , you just get sick 

00:01:03.300 --> 00:01:08.490
 which are the fruits is the are 

00:01:06.119 --> 00:01:11.960
 simply digested faster is natural 

00:01:08.490 --> 00:01:15.840
 All one thing the others too 

00:01:11.960 --> 00:01:17.689
 but needs to do right other 

00:01:15.840 --> 00:01:20.100
 video more 

00:01:17.689 --> 00:01:23.250
 in terms of quantities and so if he 

00:01:20.100 --> 00:01:24.960
 now only a small portions supplemented 

00:01:23.250 --> 00:01:26.159
 or so then that will of course also 

00:01:24.960 --> 00:01:27.869
 nothing learned from not satisfied 

00:01:26.159 --> 00:01:30.270
 or training in the Netherlands 

00:01:27.869 --> 00:01:35.250
 But as I said, it gets more in 

00:01:30.270 --> 00:01:37.950
 another medium number two in the morning 

00:01:35.250 --> 00:01:41.759
 after fasting almost more at night 

00:01:37.950 --> 00:01:44.850
 all that the metabolism is sleeping 

00:01:41.759 --> 00:01:48.390
 it's slow and cozy and if you are 

00:01:44.850 --> 00:01:51.700
 Then go directly to the coffee and 

00:01:48.390 --> 00:01:54.730
 I know where did you get that way 

00:01:51.700 --> 00:01:57.250
 just that it's almost a shock to you 

00:01:54.730 --> 00:01:59.110
 for the complete complete 

00:01:57.250 --> 00:02:01.270
 metabolism for digestion for everything 

00:01:59.110 --> 00:02:03.700
 Everything is really doing yourself with it 

00:02:01.270 --> 00:02:08.770
 none at all like that 

00:02:03.700 --> 00:02:10.560
 said fruit is best so really 

00:02:08.770 --> 00:02:13.090
 much that you a meat meal 

00:02:10.560 --> 00:02:15.820
 So now it does not just make 100 calories 

00:02:13.090 --> 00:02:21.400
 or so then as already said something 

00:02:15.820 --> 00:02:23.710
 more and with that he carries that 

00:02:21.400 --> 00:02:25.090
 digestive system metabolism slowly on 

00:02:23.710 --> 00:02:27.490
 So not like a cold one 

00:02:25.090 --> 00:02:29.800
 Shower really really slowly 

00:02:27.490 --> 00:02:32.160
 before a hallen liter to liter 

00:02:29.800 --> 00:02:37.000
 Drink water without carbonation 

00:02:32.160 --> 00:02:38.740
 and if he does not do that then he needs it 

00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:40.840
 At some point you will no longer have coffee because he 

00:02:38.740 --> 00:02:42.700
 just have so much energy that he has the 

00:02:40.840 --> 00:02:45.640
 Coffee does not need more because of the 

00:02:42.700 --> 00:02:49.840
 Just get back on your body naturally 

00:02:45.640 --> 00:02:52.990
 running on natural foods 

00:02:49.840 --> 00:02:59.860
 without any stimuli you still 

00:02:52.990 --> 00:03:02.260
 In addition, number three fruit needs it 

00:02:59.860 --> 00:03:04.330
 just totally awesome for the ladies of the 

00:03:02.260 --> 00:03:07.209
 Unfortunately, many people are 

00:03:04.330 --> 00:03:11.470
 just neglected what a pity 

00:03:07.209 --> 00:03:14.800
 because he has the immune system 

00:03:11.470 --> 00:03:15.780
 and that is a shame really 

00:03:14.800 --> 00:03:18.820
 a shame 

00:03:15.780 --> 00:03:21.459
 so if you know about it 

00:03:18.820 --> 00:03:22.480
 I have informed you and yours 

00:03:21.459 --> 00:03:25.659
 gut or 

00:03:22.480 --> 00:03:29.849
 the system was good there is a lot of fruit there 

00:03:25.659 --> 00:03:33.280
 There are fibers in it that cleanse the intestines 

00:03:29.849 --> 00:03:36.280
 pull out all the slag and have 

00:03:33.280 --> 00:03:40.629
 then really there really is 

00:03:36.280 --> 00:03:43.090
 people have years so very old 

00:03:40.629 --> 00:03:45.010
 Dirt in the gut still hanging so just 

00:03:43.090 --> 00:03:50.290
 now if you have a lot of meat and 

00:03:45.010 --> 00:03:52.930
 Dairy products then distorted in the hang 

00:03:50.290 --> 00:03:58.750
 gut and it does not dissolve for years 

00:03:52.930 --> 00:04:03.519
 So as I said for breakfast before 

00:03:58.750 --> 00:04:06.250
 wynn number four 

00:04:03.519 --> 00:04:09.099
 it's just that people are the many 

00:04:06.250 --> 00:04:11.680
 eat fruit even if the popular mouth 

00:04:09.099 --> 00:04:14.230
 other tells and says also is not 

00:04:11.680 --> 00:04:16.870
 So much fruit will you get fat or something 

00:04:14.230 --> 00:04:18.489
 it's just that the long term the 

00:04:16.870 --> 00:04:22.750
 People who eat a lot of fruits and vegetables of course 

00:04:18.489 --> 00:04:25.750
 Do not forget the blood just eat 

00:04:22.750 --> 00:04:30.789

00:04:25.750 --> 00:04:32.500

00:04:30.789 --> 00:04:34.150
 because you are simply happy 

00:04:32.500 --> 00:04:38.020
 they radiate with their diet 

00:04:34.150 --> 00:04:39.729
 and yes, I am glad that I am 

00:04:38.020 --> 00:04:44.830
 but have found to this lifestyle 

00:04:39.729 --> 00:04:49.300
