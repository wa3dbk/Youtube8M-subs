00:04:02.620 --> 00:04:02.630 
forget about when they're playing slums

00:04:02.630 --> 00:04:05.320 
forget about when they're playing slums
domination<00:04:03.290> is<00:04:03.470> they<00:04:04.100> forget<00:04:04.490> to<00:04:04.550> hold<00:04:05.120> the

00:04:05.320 --> 00:04:05.330 
domination is they forget to hold the

00:04:05.330 --> 00:04:07.600 
domination is they forget to hold the
area<00:04:05.810> I<00:04:05.960> had<00:04:06.200> this<00:04:06.350> trouble<00:04:06.590> with<00:04:06.860> all<00:04:07.100> morning

00:04:07.600 --> 00:04:07.610 
area I had this trouble with all morning

00:04:07.610 --> 00:04:11.140 
area I had this trouble with all morning
that<00:04:07.760> people<00:04:08.090> would<00:04:08.300> not<00:04:08.480> hold<00:04:08.870> the<00:04:09.140> area<00:04:10.150> all

00:04:11.140 --> 00:04:11.150 
that people would not hold the area all

00:04:11.150 --> 00:04:12.970 
that people would not hold the area all
right<00:04:11.360> domination<00:04:12.080> is<00:04:12.440> about<00:04:12.740> capturing

00:04:12.970 --> 00:04:12.980 
right domination is about capturing

00:04:12.980 --> 00:04:15.340 
right domination is about capturing
flags<00:04:13.430> I'm<00:04:13.760> gonna<00:04:14.060> give<00:04:14.180> you<00:04:14.270> that<00:04:14.450> but

00:04:15.340 --> 00:04:15.350 
flags I'm gonna give you that but

00:04:15.350 --> 00:04:18.099 
flags I'm gonna give you that but
capturing<00:04:15.620> flags<00:04:16.100> is<00:04:16.370> the<00:04:17.209> secondary<00:04:17.690> part<00:04:18.020> of

00:04:18.099 --> 00:04:18.109 
capturing flags is the secondary part of

00:04:18.109 --> 00:04:21.760 
capturing flags is the secondary part of
domination<00:04:18.650> the<00:04:19.250> flag<00:04:19.549> in<00:04:19.850> itself<00:04:20.420> is<00:04:20.630> an<00:04:21.170> idea

00:04:21.760 --> 00:04:21.770 
domination the flag in itself is an idea

00:04:21.770 --> 00:04:23.540 
domination the flag in itself is an idea
of<00:04:21.979> holding<00:04:22.280> a<00:04:22.520> part<00:04:22.760> of<00:04:22.850> the<00:04:22.970> map

00:04:23.540 --> 00:04:23.550 
of holding a part of the map

00:04:23.550 --> 00:04:25.339 
of holding a part of the map
and<00:04:23.639> you<00:04:23.940> have<00:04:24.180> to<00:04:24.360> hold<00:04:24.539> the<00:04:24.810> part<00:04:25.050> of<00:04:25.110> the<00:04:25.169> map

00:04:25.339 --> 00:04:25.349 
and you have to hold the part of the map

00:04:25.349 --> 00:04:27.350 
and you have to hold the part of the map
to<00:04:25.530> hold<00:04:25.710> the<00:04:25.800> flag<00:04:26.069> so<00:04:26.759> if<00:04:26.849> you<00:04:26.940> jump<00:04:27.210> on<00:04:27.330> a

00:04:27.350 --> 00:04:27.360 
to hold the flag so if you jump on a

00:04:27.360 --> 00:04:29.960 
to hold the flag so if you jump on a
flag<00:04:27.659> and<00:04:28.020> then<00:04:28.590> you<00:04:28.919> capture<00:04:29.340> the<00:04:29.370> flag<00:04:29.669> and

00:04:29.960 --> 00:04:29.970 
flag and then you capture the flag and

00:04:29.970 --> 00:04:31.999 
flag and then you capture the flag and
you<00:04:30.419> don't<00:04:30.629> have<00:04:30.810> access<00:04:31.050> or<00:04:31.409> you<00:04:31.560> don't<00:04:31.889> have

00:04:31.999 --> 00:04:32.009 
you don't have access or you don't have

00:04:32.009 --> 00:04:34.520 
you don't have access or you don't have
the<00:04:32.099> area<00:04:32.400> secured<00:04:32.759> around<00:04:32.879> the<00:04:33.240> flag<00:04:33.530> you

00:04:34.520 --> 00:04:34.530 
the area secured around the flag you

00:04:34.530 --> 00:04:36.290 
the area secured around the flag you
know<00:04:34.620> what's<00:04:34.770> going<00:04:34.919> to<00:04:34.949> happen<00:04:35.300> they're
