ahead of us and then catch the next team
up<00:01:09.000> above<00:01:09.240> them<00:01:09.450> and<00:01:09.799> that's<00:01:10.799> when<00:01:11.070> the<00:01:11.159> wheels

00:01:11.330 --> 00:01:11.340 
up above them and that's when the wheels

00:01:11.340 --> 00:01:14.020 
up above them and that's when the wheels
fell<00:01:11.549> off<00:01:11.610> and<00:01:12.030> we<00:01:12.780> went<00:01:12.960> into<00:01:13.080> a<00:01:13.229> spiral

00:01:14.020 --> 00:01:14.030 
fell off and we went into a spiral

fell off and we went into a spiral
didn't<00:01:15.030> come<00:01:15.150> out<00:01:15.240> of<00:01:15.390> it<00:01:15.710> have<00:01:16.710> a<00:01:16.770> real<00:01:16.950> young

00:01:17.160 --> 00:01:19.850 
didn't come out of it have a real young
team<00:01:17.430> and<00:01:17.580> I<00:01:17.640> think<00:01:17.850> that<00:01:18.030> showed<00:01:18.300> and<00:01:18.860> from

00:01:19.850 --> 00:01:19.860 
team and I think that showed and from

00:01:19.860 --> 00:01:22.220 
team and I think that showed and from
that<00:01:19.980> it<00:01:20.220> was<00:01:20.340> just<00:01:20.550> a<00:01:20.760> slide<00:01:21.390> into<00:01:22.200> a

00:01:22.220 --> 00:01:22.230 
that it was just a slide into a

00:01:22.230 --> 00:01:25.670 
that it was just a slide into a
non-playoff<00:01:22.710> position<00:01:23.280> and<00:01:24.410> we've<00:01:25.410> played

non-playoff position and we've played

for building this team has not changed I

00:01:45.270 --> 00:01:47.480 
for building this team has not changed I
think<00:01:46.200> making<00:01:46.470> the<00:01:46.680> coaching<00:01:47.040> change<00:01:47.280> and

having the coaches in here for extended
period<00:01:49.860> of<00:01:49.890> time<00:01:49.950> is<00:01:50.310> important<00:01:50.790> that<00:01:51.510> we're

00:01:51.590 --> 00:01:51.600 
period of time is important that we're

you have two evenly matched teams from a
skilled<00:02:07.290> perspective<00:02:07.830> the<00:02:07.890> bigger<00:02:08.069> team<00:02:08.310> is

00:02:08.419 --> 00:02:08.429

going to win we need to get bigger
that's<00:02:10.409> my<00:02:10.619> top<00:02:10.860> priority<00:02:11.370> as<00:02:11.459> far<00:02:11.700> as<00:02:11.849> an

00:02:12.050 --> 00:02:12.060 
that's my top priority as far as an

00:02:12.060 --> 00:02:14.420 
that's my top priority as far as an
overall<00:02:12.540> priority<00:02:13.069> positionally<00:02:14.069> we<00:02:14.190> have<00:02:14.340> to

00:02:14.420 --> 00:02:14.430 
overall priority positionally we have to

00:02:14.430 --> 00:02:15.680 
overall priority positionally we have to
look<00:02:14.550> at<00:02:14.670> the<00:02:14.700> goaltending<00:02:15.180> it<00:02:15.300> wasn't<00:02:15.599> good

00:02:15.680 --> 00:02:15.690 
look at the goaltending it wasn't good

00:02:15.690 --> 00:02:18.020 
look at the goaltending it wasn't good
enough<00:02:15.720> this<00:02:16.019> year<00:02:16.080> I<00:02:16.640> think<00:02:17.640> that<00:02:17.849> James

00:02:18.020 --> 00:02:18.030 
enough this year I think that James

00:02:18.030 --> 00:02:20.480 
enough this year I think that James
Reimer<00:02:18.360> is<00:02:18.690> the<00:02:19.200> real<00:02:19.380> deal<00:02:19.590> I<00:02:19.830> think<00:02:20.190> that<00:02:20.370> we

00:02:20.480 --> 00:02:20.490 
Reimer is the real deal I think that we

00:02:20.490 --> 00:02:23.450 
Reimer is the real deal I think that we
can<00:02:20.670> still<00:02:21.360> plan<00:02:21.630> on<00:02:21.690> him<00:02:22.080> being<00:02:22.890> a<00:02:23.069> number<00:02:23.310> one

00:02:23.450 --> 00:02:23.460 
can still plan on him being a number one

00:02:23.460 --> 00:02:24.890 
can still plan on him being a number one
guy<00:02:23.610> but<00:02:23.640> we<00:02:23.910> have<00:02:24.000> to<00:02:24.120> look<00:02:24.300> at<00:02:24.480> if<00:02:24.660> we

00:02:24.890 --> 00:02:24.900 
guy but we have to look at if we

00:02:24.900 --> 00:02:27.380 
guy but we have to look at if we
bring<00:02:25.140> in<00:02:25.260> a<00:02:25.379> guy<00:02:25.530> that<00:02:25.980> gives<00:02:26.189> us<00:02:26.430> more

00:02:27.380 --> 00:02:27.390 
bring in a guy that gives us more

00:03:42.389 --> 00:03:43.970 
little bit here we put some building
blocks<00:03:42.419> in<00:03:42.780> place<00:03:42.900> and<00:03:43.260> they<00:03:43.319> think<00:03:43.379> it's<00:03:43.620> very

00:03:43.970 --> 00:03:43.980 
blocks in place and they think it's very

00:03:43.980 --> 00:03:46.640 
blocks in place and they think it's very
easy<00:03:44.310> to<00:03:44.489> lose<00:03:44.730> sight<00:03:44.760> of<00:03:45.030> that<00:03:45.440> when<00:03:46.440> you<00:03:46.530> have

00:03:46.640 --> 00:03:46.650 
easy to lose sight of that when you have

00:03:46.650 --> 00:03:48.470 
easy to lose sight of that when you have
a<00:03:46.680> disastrous<00:03:47.250> finish<00:03:47.519> like<00:03:47.699> we<00:03:47.879> did<00:03:48.090> and<00:03:48.329> to

00:03:48.470 --> 00:03:48.480 
a disastrous finish like we did and to

00:03:48.480 --> 00:03:50.839 
a disastrous finish like we did and to
lose<00:03:48.629> sight<00:03:48.840> of<00:03:48.900> the<00:03:49.049> fact<00:03:49.109> that<00:03:49.669> we've<00:03:50.669> had

00:03:50.839 --> 00:03:50.849 
lose sight of the fact that we've had

00:03:50.849 --> 00:03:52.189 
lose sight of the fact that we've had
you<00:03:51.090> know<00:03:51.120> put<00:03:51.389> some<00:03:51.419> building<00:03:51.810> blocks<00:03:51.840> in

00:03:52.189 --> 00:03:52.199 
you know put some building blocks in

00:03:52.199 --> 00:03:53.949 
you know put some building blocks in
place<00:03:52.319> I<00:03:52.560> think<00:03:52.769> you<00:03:52.859> look<00:03:53.069> at<00:03:53.190> the<00:03:53.250> forwards

00:03:53.949 --> 00:03:53.959 
place I think you look at the forwards

00:03:53.959 --> 00:03:56.119 
place I think you look at the forwards
going<00:03:54.959> into<00:03:55.079> the<00:03:55.229> season<00:03:55.409> if<00:03:55.680> you'd<00:03:55.799> asked<00:03:55.979> me

00:03:56.119 --> 00:03:56.129 
going into the season if you'd asked me

00:03:56.129 --> 00:03:58.399 
going into the season if you'd asked me
what<00:03:57.120> I<00:03:57.150> didn't<00:03:57.599> need<00:03:57.750> to<00:03:57.840> worry<00:03:57.870> about<00:03:58.169> it

00:03:58.399 --> 00:03:58.409 
what I didn't need to worry about it

00:03:58.409 --> 00:04:00.289 
what I didn't need to worry about it
would<00:03:58.530> have<00:03:58.620> set<00:03:58.769> our<00:03:58.889> second<00:03:59.280> line<00:03:59.400> and<00:03:59.609> then

00:04:00.289 --> 00:04:00.299 
would have set our second line and then

00:04:00.299 --> 00:04:02.030 
would have set our second line and then
our<00:04:00.419> second<00:04:00.810> line<00:04:00.930> was<00:04:01.139> invisible<00:04:01.440> for<00:04:01.859> a<00:04:01.889> good

00:04:02.030 --> 00:04:02.040 
our second line was invisible for a good

00:04:02.040 --> 00:04:03.710 
our second line was invisible for a good
chunk<00:04:02.220> of<00:04:02.370> the<00:04:02.430> year<00:04:02.669> but<00:04:03.090> I<00:04:03.150> still<00:04:03.389> believe<00:04:03.690> in

00:04:03.710 --> 00:04:03.720 
chunk of the year but I still believe in

00:04:03.720 --> 00:04:06.170 
chunk of the year but I still believe in
that<00:04:03.900> group<00:04:04.169> with<00:04:04.560> MacArthur<00:04:05.129> kulemin<00:04:05.609> and

00:04:06.170 --> 00:04:06.180 
that group with MacArthur kulemin and

00:04:06.180 --> 00:04:08.330 
that group with MacArthur kulemin and
Grabovski<00:04:06.989> and<00:04:07.109> I<00:04:07.139> thought<00:04:07.319> they<00:04:07.560> all<00:04:08.010> played

00:04:08.330 --> 00:04:08.340 
Grabovski and I thought they all played

00:04:08.340 --> 00:04:10.460 
Grabovski and I thought they all played
better<00:04:08.579> obviously<00:04:09.419> cool<00:04:09.840> he<00:04:09.930> got<00:04:10.049> hurt<00:04:10.229> but<00:04:10.379> I

00:04:10.460 --> 00:04:10.470 
better obviously cool he got hurt but I

00:04:10.470 --> 00:04:11.869 
better obviously cool he got hurt but I
thought<00:04:10.620> gravel<00:04:11.069> played<00:04:11.250> better<00:04:11.430> at<00:04:11.609> the<00:04:11.729> end

00:04:11.869 --> 00:04:11.879 
thought gravel played better at the end

00:04:11.879 --> 00:04:13.849 
thought gravel played better at the end
and<00:04:12.090> I<00:04:12.690> thought<00:04:12.900> Matt<00:04:13.109> played<00:04:13.349> better<00:04:13.560> at<00:04:13.739> the

00:04:13.849 --> 00:04:13.859 
and I thought Matt played better at the

00:04:13.859 --> 00:04:16.909 
and I thought Matt played better at the
end<00:04:13.979> on<00:04:14.699> defense<00:04:15.320> we<00:04:16.320> think<00:04:16.500> we<00:04:16.590> have<00:04:16.620> a<00:04:16.709> good

00:04:16.909 --> 00:04:16.919 
end on defense we think we have a good

00:04:16.919 --> 00:04:20.029 
end on defense we think we have a good
group<00:04:16.979> a<00:04:17.549> good<00:04:18.269> age<00:04:18.539> group<00:04:18.900> we<00:04:19.590> have<00:04:19.739> a<00:04:19.769> solid

00:04:20.029 --> 00:04:20.039 
group a good age group we have a solid

00:04:20.039 --> 00:04:22.430 
group a good age group we have a solid
captain<00:04:20.639> I<00:04:20.789> think<00:04:21.599> the<00:04:21.690> emergence<00:04:22.109> of<00:04:22.199> Jake

00:04:22.430 --> 00:04:22.440 
captain I think the emergence of Jake

00:04:22.440 --> 00:04:24.080 
captain I think the emergence of Jake
Gardiner<00:04:22.830> was<00:04:22.949> a<00:04:23.010> revelation<00:04:23.430> for<00:04:23.760> all<00:04:23.880> of<00:04:24.000> us

00:04:24.080 --> 00:04:24.090 
Gardiner was a revelation for all of us

00:04:24.090 --> 00:04:26.719 
Gardiner was a revelation for all of us
so<00:04:24.930> we<00:04:25.020> got<00:04:25.530> that<00:04:25.710> quarterback<00:04:26.190> on<00:04:26.370> defense

00:04:26.719 --> 00:04:26.729 
so we got that quarterback on defense

00:04:26.729 --> 00:04:28.490 
so we got that quarterback on defense
that<00:04:26.880> most<00:04:27.090> teams<00:04:27.330> look<00:04:27.960> for<00:04:28.199> and<00:04:28.380> have

00:04:28.490 --> 00:04:28.500 
that most teams look for and have

00:04:28.500 --> 00:04:31.129 
that most teams look for and have
trouble<00:04:28.860> finding<00:04:29.300> at<00:04:30.300> the<00:04:30.449> trade<00:04:30.659> deadline<00:04:30.690> we

00:04:31.129 --> 00:04:31.139 
trouble finding at the trade deadline we

00:04:31.139 --> 00:04:32.810 
trouble finding at the trade deadline we
didn't<00:04:31.380> panic<00:04:31.560> we<00:04:31.800> kept<00:04:32.010> our<00:04:32.159> assets<00:04:32.520> we<00:04:32.789> have

00:04:32.810 --> 00:04:32.820 
didn't panic we kept our assets we have

00:04:32.820 --> 00:04:35.000 
didn't panic we kept our assets we have
all<00:04:33.210> the<00:04:33.330> players<00:04:33.539> that<00:04:33.690> teams<00:04:34.380> came<00:04:34.590> after<00:04:34.919> we

00:04:35.000 --> 00:04:35.010 
all the players that teams came after we

00:04:35.010 --> 00:04:36.320 
all the players that teams came after we
kept<00:04:35.250> those<00:04:35.370> assets<00:04:35.849> and<00:04:35.940> we<00:04:36.029> have<00:04:36.180> them

00:04:36.320 --> 00:04:36.330 
kept those assets and we have them

00:04:36.330 --> 00:04:37.839 
kept those assets and we have them
available<00:04:36.539> to<00:04:36.779> make<00:04:37.020> hockey<00:04:37.229> deals

00:04:37.839 --> 00:04:37.849 
available to make hockey deals

00:04:37.849 --> 00:04:40.119 
available to make hockey deals
and<00:04:37.939> there<00:04:38.089> will<00:04:38.209> be<00:04:38.270> changed<00:04:38.719> so<00:04:39.679> we<00:04:39.709> think<00:04:40.009> we

00:04:40.119 --> 00:04:40.129 
and there will be changed so we think we

00:04:40.129 --> 00:04:42.339 
and there will be changed so we think we
have<00:04:40.159> assets<00:04:40.669> going<00:04:40.969> into<00:04:41.179> this<00:04:41.300> period<00:04:41.749> where

00:04:42.339 --> 00:04:42.349 
have assets going into this period where

00:04:42.349 --> 00:04:43.809 
have assets going into this period where
we<00:04:42.379> can<00:04:42.679> address<00:04:42.889> some<00:04:42.979> of<00:04:43.219> the<00:04:43.339> positional

00:04:43.809 --> 00:04:43.819 
we can address some of the positional

00:04:43.819 --> 00:04:45.369 
we can address some of the positional
needs<00:04:43.999> we<00:04:44.149> have<00:04:44.330> we<00:04:44.779> think<00:04:44.990> we've<00:04:45.110> retained

00:04:45.369 --> 00:04:45.379 
needs we have we think we've retained

00:04:45.379 --> 00:04:46.689 
needs we have we think we've retained
our<00:04:45.559> assets<00:04:45.979> and<00:04:46.189> we'll<00:04:46.309> be<00:04:46.429> in<00:04:46.520> a<00:04:46.580> good

00:04:46.689 --> 00:04:46.699 
our assets and we'll be in a good

00:04:46.699 --> 00:04:49.589 
our assets and we'll be in a good
position<00:04:46.819> to<00:04:47.089> do<00:04:47.270> that<00:04:47.319> so<00:04:48.319> I<00:04:48.349> think<00:04:48.469> again

00:04:49.589 --> 00:04:49.599 
position to do that so I think again

00:04:49.599 --> 00:04:52.689 
position to do that so I think again
it's<00:04:50.599> hard<00:04:50.869> to<00:04:51.080> see<00:04:51.770> a<00:04:51.800> positive<00:04:52.069> when<00:04:52.610> you

00:04:52.689 --> 00:04:52.699 
it's hard to see a positive when you

00:04:52.699 --> 00:04:54.609 
it's hard to see a positive when you
have<00:04:52.849> a<00:04:52.879> finish<00:04:53.179> like<00:04:53.360> we<00:04:53.509> had<00:04:53.659> but<00:04:54.349> there<00:04:54.529> are

00:04:54.609 --> 00:04:54.619 
have a finish like we had but there are

00:04:54.619 --> 00:04:55.989 
have a finish like we had but there are
some<00:04:54.800> positives<00:04:55.279> there<00:04:55.399> are<00:04:55.490> some<00:04:55.699> building

00:04:55.989 --> 00:04:55.999 
some positives there are some building

00:04:55.999 --> 00:04:57.820 
some positives there are some building
blocks<00:04:56.029> there<00:04:56.959> are<00:04:57.110> some<00:04:57.319> you<00:04:57.469> know<00:04:57.499> you<00:04:57.649> see<00:04:57.800> a

00:04:57.820 --> 00:04:57.830 
blocks there are some you know you see a

00:04:57.830 --> 00:05:00.219 
blocks there are some you know you see a
Matt<00:04:58.069> Frattin<00:04:58.369> emerge<00:04:58.699> you<00:04:58.939> see<00:04:59.149> a<00:04:59.229> Carter

00:05:00.219 --> 00:05:00.229

00:05:00.229 --> 00:05:03.790 
Matt Frattin emerge you see a Carter
