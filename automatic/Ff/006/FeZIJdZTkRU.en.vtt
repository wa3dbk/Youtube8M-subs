00:01:38.749 --> 00:01:38.759 
we talk about what I think the best maps

00:01:38.759 --> 00:01:40.789 
we talk about what I think the best maps
are<00:01:39.030> in<00:01:39.180> this<00:01:39.329> game<00:01:39.570> so<00:01:39.840> far<00:01:40.020> number<00:01:40.350> one<00:01:40.590> map

00:01:40.789 --> 00:01:40.799 
are in this game so far number one map

00:01:40.799 --> 00:01:43.160 
are in this game so far number one map
has<00:01:41.280> got<00:01:41.460> to<00:01:41.640> be<00:01:41.670> right<00:01:42.060> I<00:01:42.390> think<00:01:42.840> everyone

00:01:43.160 --> 00:01:43.170 
has got to be right I think everyone

00:01:43.170 --> 00:01:45.080 
has got to be right I think everyone
really<00:01:43.409> enjoys<00:01:43.799> right<00:01:44.130> that<00:01:44.490> I've<00:01:44.610> seen<00:01:44.850> so

00:01:45.080 --> 00:01:45.090 
really enjoys right that I've seen so

00:01:45.090 --> 00:01:46.730 
really enjoys right that I've seen so
many<00:01:45.119> gameplays<00:01:45.689> I<00:01:45.840> mean<00:01:45.990> even<00:01:46.259> pre-release

00:01:46.730 --> 00:01:46.740 
many gameplays I mean even pre-release

00:01:46.740 --> 00:01:48.109 
many gameplays I mean even pre-release
when<00:01:46.890> people<00:01:47.100> were<00:01:47.189> playing<00:01:47.460> at<00:01:47.549> Gamescom

00:01:48.109 --> 00:01:48.119 
when people were playing at Gamescom

00:01:48.119 --> 00:01:50.359 
when people were playing at Gamescom
like<00:01:48.600> Benny<00:01:48.930> or<00:01:49.229> FearCrads<00:01:49.530> all<00:01:49.920> those<00:01:50.070> people

00:01:50.359 --> 00:01:50.369 
like Benny or FearCrads all those people

00:01:50.369 --> 00:01:51.800 
like Benny or FearCrads all those people
were<00:01:50.490> dropping<00:01:50.700> pretty<00:01:51.000> good<00:01:51.270> game<00:01:51.390> plays<00:01:51.689> on

00:01:51.800 --> 00:01:51.810 
were dropping pretty good game plays on

00:01:51.810 --> 00:01:53.660 
were dropping pretty good game plays on
riot<00:01:52.530> I<00:01:52.560> think<00:01:52.829> Benny<00:01:53.009> got<00:01:53.189> like<00:01:53.310> a<00:01:53.399> sniper

00:01:53.660 --> 00:01:53.670 
riot I think Benny got like a sniper

00:01:53.670 --> 00:01:56.209 
riot I think Benny got like a sniper
nuclear<00:01:54.270> which<00:01:54.750> is<00:01:54.930> pretty<00:01:55.110> crazy<00:01:55.470> and<00:01:55.770> it's

00:01:56.209 --> 00:01:56.219 
nuclear which is pretty crazy and it's

00:01:56.219 --> 00:01:57.440 
nuclear which is pretty crazy and it's
just<00:01:56.340> a<00:01:56.430> fun<00:01:56.460> have<00:01:56.759> it<00:01:56.850> flows<00:01:57.060> really<00:01:57.329> well

00:01:57.440 --> 00:01:57.450 
just a fun have it flows really well

00:01:57.450 --> 00:01:59.690 
just a fun have it flows really well
hardpoint<00:01:58.140> domination<00:01:58.710> TDM<00:01:58.979> really<00:01:59.189> any<00:01:59.430> game

00:01:59.690 --> 00:01:59.700 
hardpoint domination TDM really any game

00:01:59.700 --> 00:02:02.359 
hardpoint domination TDM really any game
mode<00:01:59.909> on<00:02:00.119> riot<00:02:00.390> flows<00:02:00.750> super<00:02:01.259> fast<00:02:01.530> because

00:02:02.359 --> 00:02:02.369 
mode on riot flows super fast because

00:02:02.369 --> 00:02:03.980 
mode on riot flows super fast because
it's<00:02:02.549> a<00:02:02.610> medium<00:02:02.939> sized<00:02:03.119> map<00:02:03.329> with<00:02:03.479> the<00:02:03.570> ex<00:02:03.750> of

00:02:03.980 --> 00:02:03.990 
it's a medium sized map with the ex of

00:02:03.990 --> 00:02:05.690 
it's a medium sized map with the ex of
movements<00:02:04.439> it<00:02:04.530> plays<00:02:04.710> even<00:02:05.009> faster<00:02:05.399> i<00:02:05.430> really

00:02:05.690 --> 00:02:05.700 
movements it plays even faster i really

00:02:05.700 --> 00:02:07.520 
movements it plays even faster i really
think<00:02:05.790> that<00:02:05.909> riot<00:02:06.180> is<00:02:06.360> a<00:02:06.390> decent<00:02:06.780> map<00:02:07.110> or<00:02:07.469> a

00:02:07.520 --> 00:02:07.530 
think that riot is a decent map or a

00:02:07.530 --> 00:02:08.900 
think that riot is a decent map or a
pretty<00:02:07.770> good<00:02:07.979> map<00:02:08.160> in<00:02:08.340> advanced<00:02:08.670> warfare

00:02:08.900 --> 00:02:08.910 
pretty good map in advanced warfare

00:02:08.910 --> 00:02:10.520 
pretty good map in advanced warfare
that's<00:02:09.060> probably<00:02:09.300> my<00:02:09.390> number<00:02:09.420> one<00:02:09.780> choice<00:02:09.810> my

00:02:10.520 --> 00:02:10.530 
that's probably my number one choice my

00:02:10.530 --> 00:02:12.740 
that's probably my number one choice my
second<00:02:10.920> choice<00:02:11.069> would<00:02:11.550> have<00:02:11.730> to<00:02:11.910> be<00:02:12.150> solar<00:02:12.629> i

00:02:12.740 --> 00:02:12.750 
second choice would have to be solar i

00:02:12.750 --> 00:02:13.850 
second choice would have to be solar i
don't<00:02:12.989> know<00:02:13.050> a<00:02:13.080> lot<00:02:13.290> of<00:02:13.319> people<00:02:13.379> don't<00:02:13.680> like

00:02:13.850 --> 00:02:13.860 
don't know a lot of people don't like

00:02:13.860 --> 00:02:15.920 
don't know a lot of people don't like
Solar<00:02:14.100> but<00:02:14.250> I<00:02:14.340> like<00:02:14.580> it<00:02:14.760> it<00:02:15.240> seems<00:02:15.510> like<00:02:15.600> it's<00:02:15.780> a

00:02:15.920 --> 00:02:15.930 
Solar but I like it it seems like it's a

00:02:15.930 --> 00:02:18.350 
Solar but I like it it seems like it's a
lot<00:02:16.170> like<00:02:16.350> melt<00:02:16.710> down<00:02:16.950> from<00:02:17.250> black<00:02:17.430> ops<00:02:17.640> 2<00:02:17.970> it's

00:02:18.350 --> 00:02:18.360 
lot like melt down from black ops 2 it's

00:02:18.360 --> 00:02:19.940 
lot like melt down from black ops 2 it's
got<00:02:18.540> that<00:02:18.660> same<00:02:18.840> sort<00:02:19.140> of<00:02:19.200> feel<00:02:19.440> to<00:02:19.470> it<00:02:19.710> with

00:02:19.940 --> 00:02:19.950 
got that same sort of feel to it with

00:02:19.950 --> 00:02:21.260 
got that same sort of feel to it with
the<00:02:19.980> bee<00:02:20.190> flag<00:02:20.460> being<00:02:20.670> in<00:02:20.790> the<00:02:20.880> middle<00:02:21.000> it's

00:02:21.260 --> 00:02:21.270 
the bee flag being in the middle it's

00:02:21.270 --> 00:02:24.200 
the bee flag being in the middle it's
B's<00:02:21.540> obviously<00:02:22.470> very<00:02:22.740> hectic<00:02:23.040> in<00:02:23.820> terms<00:02:24.060> of

00:02:24.200 --> 00:02:24.210 
B's obviously very hectic in terms of

00:02:24.210 --> 00:02:25.940 
B's obviously very hectic in terms of
domination<00:02:24.870> the<00:02:24.960> long<00:02:25.140> range<00:02:25.380> engagements<00:02:25.530> as

00:02:25.940 --> 00:02:25.950 
domination the long range engagements as

00:02:25.950 --> 00:02:27.500 
domination the long range engagements as
well<00:02:26.070> as<00:02:26.160> the<00:02:26.280> close<00:02:26.490> range<00:02:26.760> engagements<00:02:26.940> that

00:02:27.500 --> 00:02:27.510 
well as the close range engagements that

00:02:27.510 --> 00:02:28.970 
well as the close range engagements that
solar<00:02:27.930> provides<00:02:28.170> you<00:02:28.470> just<00:02:28.620> feel<00:02:28.740> like<00:02:28.800> make

00:02:28.970 --> 00:02:28.980 
solar provides you just feel like make

00:02:28.980 --> 00:02:30.860 
solar provides you just feel like make
the<00:02:29.160> map<00:02:29.340> a<00:02:29.370> lot<00:02:29.670> more<00:02:29.850> fun<00:02:30.120> another<00:02:30.540> map<00:02:30.750> that

00:02:30.860 --> 00:02:30.870 
the map a lot more fun another map that

00:02:30.870 --> 00:02:32.840 
the map a lot more fun another map that
I<00:02:30.930> think<00:02:31.170> I<00:02:31.290> really<00:02:31.560> enjoy<00:02:31.800> is<00:02:32.010> come<00:02:32.670> back

00:02:32.840 --> 00:02:32.850 
I think I really enjoy is come back

00:02:32.850 --> 00:02:34.190 
I think I really enjoy is come back
which<00:02:33.030> is<00:02:33.180> a<00:02:33.210> map<00:02:33.420> that<00:02:33.450> when<00:02:33.720> I<00:02:33.750> first<00:02:34.050> started

00:02:34.190 --> 00:02:34.200 
which is a map that when I first started

00:02:34.200 --> 00:02:35.810 
which is a map that when I first started
playing<00:02:34.470> I<00:02:34.740> didn't<00:02:35.100> think<00:02:35.190> I<00:02:35.340> was<00:02:35.430> going<00:02:35.640> to

00:02:35.810 --> 00:02:35.820 
playing I didn't think I was going to

00:02:35.820 --> 00:02:37.130 
playing I didn't think I was going to
enjoy<00:02:36.150> it<00:02:36.300> that<00:02:36.420> much<00:02:36.450> this<00:02:36.720> is<00:02:36.780> one<00:02:36.990> of<00:02:37.020> the

00:02:37.130 --> 00:02:37.140 
enjoy it that much this is one of the

00:02:37.140 --> 00:02:39.080 
enjoy it that much this is one of the
maps<00:02:37.260> it<00:02:37.440> doesn't<00:02:37.710> have<00:02:37.860> as<00:02:38.070> much<00:02:38.370> vibrance<00:02:38.910> or

00:02:39.080 --> 00:02:39.090 
maps it doesn't have as much vibrance or

00:02:39.090 --> 00:02:41.750 
maps it doesn't have as much vibrance or
saturation<00:02:40.080> in<00:02:40.320> terms<00:02:40.560> of<00:02:40.740> looks<00:02:41.070> but<00:02:41.610> it

00:02:41.750 --> 00:02:41.760 
saturation in terms of looks but it

00:02:41.760 --> 00:02:43.340 
saturation in terms of looks but it
plays<00:02:42.000> really<00:02:42.270> really<00:02:42.600> well<00:02:42.750> it<00:02:42.900> seems<00:02:43.200> like

00:02:43.340 --> 00:02:43.350 
plays really really well it seems like

00:02:43.350 --> 00:02:45.260 
plays really really well it seems like
it's<00:02:43.590> a<00:02:43.680> very<00:02:43.920> small<00:02:44.280> map<00:02:44.640> although<00:02:44.910> if<00:02:45.180> you

00:02:45.260 --> 00:02:45.270 
it's a very small map although if you

00:02:45.270 --> 00:02:46.640 
it's a very small map although if you
were<00:02:45.360> to<00:02:45.450> look<00:02:45.480> at<00:02:45.720> it<00:02:45.810> you<00:02:45.870> think<00:02:46.020> it's<00:02:46.230> bigger

00:02:46.640 --> 00:02:46.650 
were to look at it you think it's bigger

00:02:46.650 --> 00:02:48.650 
were to look at it you think it's bigger
but<00:02:47.160> it<00:02:47.220> plays<00:02:47.550> like<00:02:47.730> it's<00:02:47.910> a<00:02:47.970> very<00:02:48.150> small<00:02:48.390> map

00:02:48.650 --> 00:02:48.660 
but it plays like it's a very small map

00:02:48.660 --> 00:02:51.410 
but it plays like it's a very small map

plays super fast on this map and I think

00:02:53.610 --> 00:02:54.740 
plays super fast on this map and I think
it's<00:02:53.850> really<00:02:54.060> good<00:02:54.270> mad<00:02:54.390> this<00:02:54.540> is<00:02:54.600> probably

00:02:54.740 --> 00:02:54.750 
it's really good mad this is probably

00:02:54.750 --> 00:02:56.300 
it's really good mad this is probably
gonna<00:02:54.900> be<00:02:54.989> a<00:02:55.080> very<00:02:55.320> good<00:02:55.440> map<00:02:55.739> for<00:02:56.010> people

00:02:56.300 --> 00:02:56.310 
gonna be a very good map for people

00:02:56.310 --> 00:02:58.070 
gonna be a very good map for people
going<00:02:56.459> for<00:02:56.760> a<00:02:56.790> high-scoring<00:02:57.270> game<00:02:57.480> plays<00:02:57.720> with

00:02:58.070 --> 00:02:58.080 
going for a high-scoring game plays with

00:02:58.080 --> 00:02:59.660 
going for a high-scoring game plays with
kill<00:02:58.380> streaks<00:02:58.709> or<00:02:58.830> with<00:02:58.950> scorestreaks<00:02:59.459> rather

00:02:59.660 --> 00:02:59.670 
kill streaks or with scorestreaks rather

00:02:59.670 --> 00:03:01.910 
kill streaks or with scorestreaks rather
because<00:03:00.030> it's<00:03:00.180> a<00:03:00.239> pretty<00:03:00.450> open<00:03:00.690> map<00:03:01.020> minus<00:03:01.770> the

00:03:01.910 --> 00:03:01.920 
because it's a pretty open map minus the

00:03:01.920 --> 00:03:03.860 
because it's a pretty open map minus the
one<00:03:02.100> building<00:03:02.520> in<00:03:02.670> the<00:03:02.790> very<00:03:03.000> middle<00:03:03.300> I<00:03:03.480> think

00:03:03.860 --> 00:03:03.870 
one building in the very middle I think

00:03:03.870 --> 00:03:04.910 
one building in the very middle I think
that's<00:03:03.989> gonna<00:03:04.080> be<00:03:04.260> really<00:03:04.380> good<00:03:04.560> map<00:03:04.709> for

00:03:04.910 --> 00:03:04.920 
that's gonna be really good map for

00:03:04.920 --> 00:03:06.140 
that's gonna be really good map for
gameplays<00:03:05.370> and<00:03:05.400> that's<00:03:05.730> pretty<00:03:05.850> much<00:03:05.940> going

00:03:06.140 --> 00:03:06.150 
gameplays and that's pretty much going

00:03:06.150 --> 00:03:07.310 
gameplays and that's pretty much going
