00:01:07.609 --> 00:01:07.619 
challenges as a voice actor I think that

00:01:07.619 --> 00:01:09.050 
challenges as a voice actor I think that
people<00:01:07.860> don't<00:01:08.010> realize<00:01:08.159> because<00:01:08.430> on<00:01:08.640> camera

00:01:09.050 --> 00:01:09.060 
people don't realize because on camera

00:01:09.060 --> 00:01:10.580 
people don't realize because on camera
maybe<00:01:09.510> it's<00:01:09.840> a<00:01:09.900> little<00:01:10.110> bit<00:01:10.200> easier<00:01:10.229> because

00:01:10.580 --> 00:01:10.590 
maybe it's a little bit easier because

00:01:10.590 --> 00:01:12.350 
maybe it's a little bit easier because
you<00:01:10.740> have<00:01:10.830> to<00:01:10.890> sort<00:01:11.070> of<00:01:11.130> create<00:01:11.310> what<00:01:12.240> the

00:01:12.350 --> 00:01:12.360
