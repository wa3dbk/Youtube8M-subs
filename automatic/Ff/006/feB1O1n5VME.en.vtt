you<00:00:07.000> know<00:00:07.120> some<00:00:07.390> teams<00:00:07.600> are<00:00:07.720> great<00:00:07.990> because

00:00:08.129 --> 00:00:08.139 
you know some teams are great because

00:00:08.139 --> 00:00:10.110 
you know some teams are great because
they're<00:00:08.440> together<00:00:08.650> and<00:00:08.920> then<00:00:09.250> some<00:00:09.640> teams<00:00:09.970> are

00:00:10.110 --> 00:00:10.120 
they're together and then some teams are

00:00:10.120 --> 00:00:12.690 
they're together and then some teams are
great<00:00:10.390> because<00:00:10.599> they're<00:00:11.500> talented<00:00:11.769> and<00:00:12.220> then

00:00:12.690 --> 00:00:12.700 
great because they're talented and then

00:00:12.700 --> 00:00:15.810 
great because they're talented and then
you<00:00:12.970> get<00:00:13.150> a<00:00:13.179> team<00:00:13.540> that<00:00:13.929> is<00:00:14.200> very<00:00:14.830> talented<00:00:15.340> and

00:00:15.810 --> 00:00:15.820 
you get a team that is very talented and

00:00:15.820 --> 00:00:18.540 
you get a team that is very talented and
very<00:00:16.019> together<00:00:17.019> and<00:00:17.380> it's<00:00:18.010> quite<00:00:18.520> a

00:00:18.540 --> 00:00:18.550 
very together and it's quite a

00:00:18.550 --> 00:00:20.849 
very together and it's quite a
combination<00:00:19.300> I<00:00:19.510> say<00:00:20.110> the<00:00:20.230> identity<00:00:20.680> of<00:00:20.710> this

00:00:20.849 --> 00:00:20.859 
combination I say the identity of this

00:00:20.859 --> 00:00:23.279 
combination I say the identity of this
team<00:00:21.130> is<00:00:21.400> just<00:00:21.520> a<00:00:21.670> hard-working<00:00:22.420> dedicated

00:00:23.279 --> 00:00:23.289 
team is just a hard-working dedicated

00:00:23.289 --> 00:00:25.679 
team is just a hard-working dedicated
team<00:00:23.949> I<00:00:24.279> think<00:00:24.550> the<00:00:24.880> girls<00:00:25.150> this<00:00:25.330> year<00:00:25.390> have

00:00:25.679 --> 00:00:25.689 
team I think the girls this year have

00:00:25.689 --> 00:00:28.290 
team I think the girls this year have
really<00:00:26.050> bought<00:00:26.199> into<00:00:26.410> the<00:00:26.590> systems<00:00:27.010> and<00:00:27.369> we're

00:00:28.290 --> 00:00:28.300 
really bought into the systems and we're

00:00:28.300 --> 00:00:29.960 
really bought into the systems and we're
really<00:00:28.480> trying<00:00:28.689> to<00:00:28.779> prove<00:00:28.960> ourselves<00:00:29.170> that

00:00:29.960 --> 00:00:29.970 
really trying to prove ourselves that

00:00:29.970 --> 00:00:32.310 
really trying to prove ourselves that
you<00:00:30.970> don't<00:00:31.119> need<00:00:31.240> certain<00:00:31.570> players<00:00:31.869> to

00:00:32.310 --> 00:00:32.320 
you don't need certain players to

00:00:32.320 --> 00:00:33.809 
you don't need certain players to
necessarily<00:00:32.920> be<00:00:33.010> a<00:00:33.039> championship<00:00:33.489> team<00:00:33.670> you

00:00:33.809 --> 00:00:33.819 
necessarily be a championship team you

00:00:33.819 --> 00:00:35.189 
necessarily be a championship team you
just<00:00:33.969> need<00:00:34.120> the<00:00:34.149> chemistry<00:00:34.629> and<00:00:34.659> to<00:00:34.809> work<00:00:34.929> hard

00:00:35.189 --> 00:00:35.199 
just need the chemistry and to work hard

00:00:35.199 --> 00:00:37.979 
just need the chemistry and to work hard
I<00:00:35.850> think<00:00:36.850> the<00:00:36.969> thing<00:00:37.149> I'm<00:00:37.269> most<00:00:37.300> proud<00:00:37.629> of<00:00:37.749> is

00:00:37.979 --> 00:00:37.989 
I think the thing I'm most proud of is

00:00:37.989 --> 00:00:40.680 
I think the thing I'm most proud of is
is<00:00:38.229> the<00:00:38.440> culture<00:00:38.889> that<00:00:39.639> we've<00:00:39.850> developed<00:00:40.059> we

00:00:40.680 --> 00:00:40.690 
is the culture that we've developed we

00:00:40.690 --> 00:00:43.099 
is the culture that we've developed we
have<00:00:40.719> four<00:00:41.139> values<00:00:41.620> of<00:00:41.859> being<00:00:42.039> tough<00:00:42.370> grateful

00:00:43.099 --> 00:00:43.109 
have four values of being tough grateful

00:00:43.109 --> 00:00:45.779 
have four values of being tough grateful
disciplined<00:00:44.109> and<00:00:44.229> devoted<00:00:44.739> and<00:00:44.920> let's

00:00:45.779 --> 00:00:45.789 
disciplined and devoted and let's

00:00:45.789 --> 00:00:47.549 
disciplined and devoted and let's
measure<00:00:45.999> ourself<00:00:46.539> up<00:00:46.719> against<00:00:47.049> our<00:00:47.170> values

00:00:47.549 --> 00:00:47.559 
measure ourself up against our values

00:00:47.559 --> 00:00:49.559 
measure ourself up against our values
each<00:00:47.769> and<00:00:47.979> every<00:00:48.159> day<00:00:48.339> instead<00:00:49.239> of<00:00:49.359> measuring

00:00:49.559 --> 00:00:49.569 
each and every day instead of measuring

00:00:49.569 --> 00:01:07.810 
each and every day instead of measuring
ourselves<00:00:49.929> against<00:00:50.620> wins<00:00:50.829> or<00:00:51.039> losses

00:01:07.810 --> 00:01:07.820 

00:01:07.820 --> 00:01:15.730 

I<00:01:12.580> still<00:01:13.580> remember<00:01:13.760> on<00:01:14.360> day<00:01:14.780> one<00:01:15.050> talking<00:01:15.530> to

00:01:15.730 --> 00:01:15.740 
I still remember on day one talking to

00:01:15.740 --> 00:01:17.680 
I still remember on day one talking to
our<00:01:15.830> players<00:01:16.100> about<00:01:16.460> the<00:01:16.970> importance<00:01:17.450> of<00:01:17.600> the

00:01:17.680 --> 00:01:17.690 
our players about the importance of the

00:01:17.690 --> 00:01:20.290 
our players about the importance of the
process<00:01:17.930> and<00:01:18.380> not<00:01:18.440> the<00:01:18.560> outcome<00:01:18.740> and<00:01:19.520> I<00:01:20.120> made<00:01:20.270> a

00:01:20.290 --> 00:01:20.300 
process and not the outcome and I made a

00:01:20.300 --> 00:01:22.570 
process and not the outcome and I made a
comment<00:01:20.619> such<00:01:21.619> as<00:01:21.860> we're<00:01:22.220> gonna<00:01:22.310> lose<00:01:22.550> a

00:01:22.570 --> 00:01:22.580 
comment such as we're gonna lose a

00:01:22.580 --> 00:01:25.420 
comment such as we're gonna lose a
hockey<00:01:22.880> game<00:01:23.260> so<00:01:24.260> it's<00:01:24.650> not<00:01:24.860> always<00:01:25.070> about<00:01:25.310> the

00:01:25.420 --> 00:01:25.430 
hockey game so it's not always about the

00:01:25.430 --> 00:01:27.040 
hockey game so it's not always about the
wins<00:01:25.700> and<00:01:25.910> losses<00:01:26.000> let's<00:01:26.450> focus<00:01:26.630> on<00:01:26.930> the

00:01:27.040 --> 00:01:27.050 
wins and losses let's focus on the

00:01:27.050 --> 00:01:29.530 
wins and losses let's focus on the
process<00:01:27.530> of<00:01:27.650> those<00:01:27.770> things<00:01:28.100> and<00:01:28.520> here<00:01:29.390> we<00:01:29.509> are

00:01:29.530 --> 00:01:29.540 
process of those things and here we are

00:01:29.540 --> 00:01:31.930 
process of those things and here we are
41<00:01:30.170> games<00:01:30.380> later<00:01:30.770> without<00:01:31.009> loss<00:01:31.430> and<00:01:31.820> it's

00:01:31.930 --> 00:01:31.940 
41 games later without loss and it's

00:01:31.940 --> 00:01:35.350 
41 games later without loss and it's
just<00:01:32.350> it's<00:01:33.350> just<00:01:33.440> mind-boggling<00:01:34.100> I<00:01:34.369> can't

00:01:35.350 --> 00:01:35.360 
just it's just mind-boggling I can't

00:01:35.360 --> 00:01:38.980 
just it's just mind-boggling I can't
even<00:01:35.479> believe<00:01:35.690> it<00:01:36.640> I'm<00:01:37.640> going<00:01:38.420> for<00:01:38.750> you<00:01:38.840> want

even believe it I'm going for you want

00:01:38.990 --> 00:01:40.630 
even believe it I'm going for you want
to<00:01:39.080> know<00:01:39.200> having<00:01:39.560> that<00:01:39.740> you<00:01:39.770> know<00:01:40.009> perfect

00:01:40.630 --> 00:01:40.640 
to know having that you know perfect

00:01:40.640 --> 00:01:44.080 
to know having that you know perfect
season<00:01:41.030> was<00:01:41.830> something<00:01:42.830> I'd<00:01:42.979> never<00:01:43.700> even

00:01:44.080 --> 00:01:44.090 
season was something I'd never even

00:01:44.090 --> 00:01:47.109 
season was something I'd never even
thought<00:01:44.390> possible<00:01:44.990> so<00:01:45.950> yeah<00:01:46.340> that<00:01:46.670> was<00:01:46.850> pretty

00:01:47.109 --> 00:01:47.119 
thought possible so yeah that was pretty

00:01:47.119 --> 00:01:51.070 
thought possible so yeah that was pretty
different<00:01:47.979> you<00:01:48.979> know<00:01:49.130> it's<00:01:49.310> of<00:01:49.729> course<00:01:50.300> it's<00:01:50.899> a

00:01:51.070 --> 00:01:51.080 
different you know it's of course it's a

00:01:51.080 --> 00:01:52.690 
different you know it's of course it's a
game<00:01:51.229> of<00:01:51.410> hockey<00:01:51.619> and<00:01:51.979> things<00:01:52.220> aren't<00:01:52.430> perfect

00:01:52.690 --> 00:01:52.700 
game of hockey and things aren't perfect

00:01:52.700 --> 00:01:56.529 
game of hockey and things aren't perfect
and<00:01:53.119> and<00:01:53.330> you're<00:01:53.810> going<00:01:54.140> to<00:01:54.320> lose<00:01:54.500> games<00:01:55.539> well

00:01:56.529 --> 00:01:56.539 
and and you're going to lose games well

00:01:56.539 --> 00:02:00.580 
and and you're going to lose games well
my<00:01:56.690> reaction<00:01:56.930> to<00:01:57.320> the<00:01:57.410> streak<00:01:57.680> ending<00:01:58.039> was<00:01:59.590> it

00:02:00.580 --> 00:02:00.590 
my reaction to the streak ending was it

00:02:00.590 --> 00:02:02.520 
my reaction to the streak ending was it
really<00:02:00.920> allowed<00:02:01.160> me<00:02:01.310> to<00:02:01.340> step<00:02:01.640> back<00:02:01.910> and

00:02:02.520 --> 00:02:02.530 
really allowed me to step back and

00:02:02.530 --> 00:02:04.600 
really allowed me to step back and
realize<00:02:03.530> that<00:02:03.950> we<00:02:04.070> were<00:02:04.160> part<00:02:04.460> of<00:02:04.550> something

00:02:04.600 --> 00:02:04.610 
realize that we were part of something

00:02:04.610 --> 00:02:07.389 
realize that we were part of something
incredibly<00:02:05.420> special<00:02:05.830> to<00:02:06.830> have<00:02:06.950> the<00:02:07.070> previous
