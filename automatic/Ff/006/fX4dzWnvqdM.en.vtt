00:04:05.080 --> 00:04:06.720 
fast and they want point out like I said
it<00:04:05.200> does<00:04:05.350> have<00:04:05.590> headless<00:04:06.130> mode<00:04:06.400> and<00:04:06.610> what

00:04:06.720 --> 00:04:06.730 
it does have headless mode and what

00:04:06.730 --> 00:04:09.260 
it does have headless mode and what
headless<00:04:07.060> mode<00:04:07.300> does<00:04:07.600> is<00:04:07.950> you<00:04:08.950> actually

00:04:09.260 --> 00:04:09.270 
headless mode does is you actually

00:04:09.270 --> 00:04:12.000 
headless mode does is you actually
access<00:04:10.270> the<00:04:10.300> headless<00:04:10.810> mode<00:04:11.050> by<00:04:11.290> pushing<00:04:11.620> down

00:04:12.000 --> 00:04:12.010 
access the headless mode by pushing down

00:04:12.010 --> 00:04:14.880 
access the headless mode by pushing down
on<00:04:12.250> the<00:04:12.940> left<00:04:13.420> throttle<00:04:14.170> you<00:04:14.410> push<00:04:14.680> that

00:04:14.880 --> 00:04:14.890 
on the left throttle you push that

00:04:14.890 --> 00:04:17.190 
on the left throttle you push that
button<00:04:15.160> inward<00:04:15.850> you'll<00:04:16.450> start<00:04:16.750> hearing<00:04:16.989> a

00:04:17.190 --> 00:04:17.200 
button inward you'll start hearing a

00:04:17.200 --> 00:04:18.660 
button inward you'll start hearing a
beeping<00:04:17.620> noise<00:04:17.680> and<00:04:18.160> that<00:04:18.250> beeping<00:04:18.640> noise

00:04:18.660 --> 00:04:18.670 
beeping noise and that beeping noise

00:04:18.670 --> 00:04:20.370 
beeping noise and that beeping noise
will<00:04:19.030> indicate<00:04:19.420> that<00:04:19.600> you're<00:04:19.930> in<00:04:20.050> headless

00:04:20.370 --> 00:04:20.380 
will indicate that you're in headless

00:04:20.380 --> 00:04:22.740 
will indicate that you're in headless
mode<00:04:20.620> when<00:04:21.310> headless<00:04:21.820> mode<00:04:22.090> it's<00:04:22.510> good<00:04:22.720> for

00:04:22.740 --> 00:04:22.750 
mode when headless mode it's good for

00:04:22.750 --> 00:04:24.420 
mode when headless mode it's good for
beginners<00:04:23.050> because<00:04:23.590> no<00:04:23.980> matter<00:04:24.190> the

00:04:24.420 --> 00:04:24.430 
beginners because no matter the

00:04:24.430 --> 00:04:26.940 
beginners because no matter the
orientation<00:04:25.180> of<00:04:25.240> the<00:04:25.300> quadcopter<00:04:26.080> on<00:04:26.290> your

orientation of the quadcopter on your

00:04:26.950 --> 00:04:28.830 
orientation of the quadcopter on your
directional<00:04:27.610> pad<00:04:27.880> Ford<00:04:28.330> will<00:04:28.420> always<00:04:28.720> be

00:04:28.830 --> 00:04:28.840 
directional pad Ford will always be

00:04:28.840 --> 00:04:30.270 
directional pad Ford will always be
forward<00:04:29.200> and<00:04:29.350> backward<00:04:29.740> will<00:04:29.950> always<00:04:30.160> be

00:04:30.270 --> 00:04:30.280 
forward and backward will always be

00:04:30.280 --> 00:04:32.490 
forward and backward will always be
backwards<00:04:30.820> and<00:04:31.030> to<00:04:31.600> click<00:04:31.840> out<00:04:31.990> a<00:04:32.020> headless

00:04:32.490 --> 00:04:32.500 
backwards and to click out a headless

00:04:32.500 --> 00:04:34.470 
backwards and to click out a headless
mode<00:04:32.710> you<00:04:32.860> just<00:04:33.070> push<00:04:33.280> down<00:04:33.310> on<00:04:33.790> that<00:04:34.180> throttle

00:04:34.470 --> 00:04:34.480 
mode you just push down on that throttle

00:04:34.480 --> 00:04:37.410 
mode you just push down on that throttle
again<00:04:35.350> and<00:04:35.650> also<00:04:36.100> this<00:04:36.280> does<00:04:36.610> flips<00:04:37.120> you<00:04:37.270> can

00:04:37.410 --> 00:04:37.420 
again and also this does flips you can

00:04:37.420 --> 00:04:39.780 
again and also this does flips you can
flip<00:04:37.660> this<00:04:37.840> frontwards<00:04:38.800> backwards<00:04:38.920> left<00:04:39.640> or

00:04:39.780 --> 00:04:39.790 
flip this frontwards backwards left or

00:04:39.790 --> 00:04:43.290 
flip this frontwards backwards left or
right<00:04:40.000> you<00:04:40.570> push<00:04:40.840> in<00:04:41.110> on<00:04:41.320> the<00:04:42.060> directional<00:04:43.060> pad

00:04:43.290 --> 00:04:43.300 
right you push in on the directional pad

00:04:43.300 --> 00:04:44.910 
right you push in on the directional pad
and<00:04:43.630> then<00:04:43.690> you<00:04:43.840> push<00:04:44.050> the<00:04:44.080> direction<00:04:44.560> you'd

00:04:44.910 --> 00:04:44.920 
and then you push the direction you'd

00:04:44.920 --> 00:04:46.830 
and then you push the direction you'd
like<00:04:45.070> to<00:04:45.310> flip<00:04:45.550> now<00:04:46.060> the<00:04:46.120> transmitter<00:04:46.690> is

00:04:46.830 --> 00:04:46.840 
like to flip now the transmitter is

00:04:46.840 --> 00:04:48.780 
like to flip now the transmitter is
pretty<00:04:47.050> basic<00:04:47.380> and<00:04:47.650> simple<00:04:47.920> we<00:04:48.220> just<00:04:48.400> have<00:04:48.520> an

00:04:48.780 --> 00:04:48.790 
pretty basic and simple we just have an

00:04:48.790 --> 00:04:50.610 
pretty basic and simple we just have an
off<00:04:49.090> switch<00:04:49.330> in<00:04:49.630> the<00:04:49.720> middle<00:04:50.050> then<00:04:50.260> we<00:04:50.380> have

00:04:50.610 --> 00:04:50.620 
off switch in the middle then we have

00:04:50.620 --> 00:04:53.580 
off switch in the middle then we have
the<00:04:50.800> throttle<00:04:51.310> and<00:04:51.490> the<00:04:52.380> directional<00:04:53.380> and

00:04:53.580 --> 00:04:53.590 
the throttle and the directional and

00:04:53.590 --> 00:04:56.430 
the throttle and the directional and
then<00:04:53.680> we<00:04:53.770> have<00:04:53.950> a<00:04:53.980> FB<00:04:54.340> and<00:04:55.210> lr<00:04:55.810> that<00:04:56.200> just

00:04:56.430 --> 00:04:56.440 
then we have a FB and lr that just

00:04:56.440 --> 00:04:59.970 
then we have a FB and lr that just
allows<00:04:56.980> you<00:04:57.250> to<00:04:57.810> trim<00:04:58.810> out<00:04:59.020> the<00:04:59.050> quadcopter<00:04:59.890> if

00:04:59.970 --> 00:04:59.980 
allows you to trim out the quadcopter if

00:04:59.980 --> 00:05:01.500 
allows you to trim out the quadcopter if
you<00:05:00.070> have<00:05:00.160> any<00:05:00.310> issues<00:05:00.490> but<00:05:00.970> usually<00:05:01.270> I<00:05:01.330> don't

00:05:01.500 --> 00:05:01.510 
you have any issues but usually I don't

00:05:01.510 --> 00:05:03.150 
you have any issues but usually I don't
even<00:05:01.570> trim<00:05:01.930> it<00:05:02.050> I<00:05:02.140> just<00:05:02.170> I<00:05:02.500> would<00:05:02.740> reset

00:05:03.150 --> 00:05:03.160 
even trim it I just I would reset

00:05:03.160 --> 00:05:04.230 
even trim it I just I would reset
everything<00:05:03.430> by<00:05:03.760> turning<00:05:04.030> off<00:05:04.180> the

00:05:04.230 --> 00:05:04.240 
everything by turning off the

00:05:04.240 --> 00:05:06.470 
everything by turning off the
transmitter<00:05:04.840> and<00:05:05.080> then<00:05:05.530> I<00:05:05.620> turn<00:05:05.890> off<00:05:05.920> the

00:05:06.470 --> 00:05:06.480 
transmitter and then I turn off the

00:05:06.480 --> 00:05:08.970 
transmitter and then I turn off the
hexacopter<00:05:07.480> itself<00:05:08.170> set<00:05:08.470> it<00:05:08.590> on<00:05:08.680> a<00:05:08.740> flat

00:05:08.970 --> 00:05:08.980 
hexacopter itself set it on a flat

00:05:08.980 --> 00:05:11.100 
hexacopter itself set it on a flat
surface<00:05:09.010> and<00:05:09.640> just<00:05:10.120> turn<00:05:10.270> it<00:05:10.420> back<00:05:10.540> on<00:05:10.720> and<00:05:11.020> I

00:05:11.100 --> 00:05:11.110 
surface and just turn it back on and I

00:05:11.110 --> 00:05:12.990 
surface and just turn it back on and I
just<00:05:11.290> really<00:05:11.680> don't<00:05:11.890> never<00:05:12.280> need<00:05:12.550> to<00:05:12.580> mess

00:05:12.990 --> 00:05:13.000 
just really don't never need to mess

00:05:13.000 --> 00:05:15.450 
just really don't never need to mess
with<00:05:13.180> the<00:05:13.300> trims<00:05:13.630> the<00:05:13.920> transmitter<00:05:14.920> does<00:05:15.220> run

00:05:15.450 --> 00:05:15.460 
with the trims the transmitter does run

00:05:15.460 --> 00:05:17.310 
with the trims the transmitter does run
off<00:05:15.670> of<00:05:15.700> to<00:05:16.090> triple-a<00:05:16.570> batteries<00:05:17.110> that<00:05:17.290> are

00:05:17.310 --> 00:05:17.320 
off of to triple-a batteries that are

00:05:17.320 --> 00:05:18.840 
off of to triple-a batteries that are
not<00:05:17.560> included<00:05:18.010> so<00:05:18.160> you'll<00:05:18.280> have<00:05:18.340> to<00:05:18.430> pick<00:05:18.640> them

00:05:18.840 --> 00:05:18.850 
not included so you'll have to pick them

00:05:18.850 --> 00:05:20.310 
not included so you'll have to pick them
up<00:05:18.880> so<00:05:19.480> if<00:05:19.540> we<00:05:19.660> look<00:05:19.690> at<00:05:19.870> the<00:05:19.990> hexacopter

00:05:20.310 --> 00:05:20.320 
up so if we look at the hexacopter

00:05:20.320 --> 00:05:23.400 
up so if we look at the hexacopter
itself<00:05:21.130> we<00:05:21.520> do<00:05:21.640> have<00:05:21.760> a<00:05:21.820> built-in<00:05:22.390> battery<00:05:22.720> so

00:05:23.400 --> 00:05:23.410 
itself we do have a built-in battery so

00:05:23.410 --> 00:05:25.740 
itself we do have a built-in battery so
it<00:05:23.980> does<00:05:24.430> come<00:05:24.610> with<00:05:24.640> a<00:05:24.790> charging<00:05:25.300> cable<00:05:25.450> the

00:05:25.740 --> 00:05:25.750 
it does come with a charging cable the

00:05:25.750 --> 00:05:27.630 
it does come with a charging cable the
charging<00:05:26.170> port<00:05:26.350> is<00:05:26.500> located<00:05:26.650> on<00:05:27.100> the<00:05:27.250> back<00:05:27.460> you

00:05:27.630 --> 00:05:27.640 
charging port is located on the back you

00:05:27.640 --> 00:05:29.100 
charging port is located on the back you
just<00:05:27.850> plug<00:05:28.060> that<00:05:28.090> into<00:05:28.450> the<00:05:28.660> included<00:05:29.080> USB

00:05:29.100 --> 00:05:29.110 
just plug that into the included USB

00:05:29.110 --> 00:05:31.950 
just plug that into the included USB
cable<00:05:29.580> charge<00:05:30.580> it<00:05:30.700> for<00:05:30.910> 45<00:05:31.270> minutes<00:05:31.630> and<00:05:31.870> your

00:05:31.950 --> 00:05:31.960 
cable charge it for 45 minutes and your

00:05:31.960 --> 00:05:34.440 
cable charge it for 45 minutes and your
good<00:05:32.440> fly<00:05:32.710> times<00:05:33.040> about<00:05:33.340> seven<00:05:33.790> minutes<00:05:34.000> or<00:05:34.270> so

00:05:34.440 --> 00:05:34.450 
good fly times about seven minutes or so

00:05:34.450 --> 00:05:36.750 
good fly times about seven minutes or so
just<00:05:34.830> depending<00:05:35.830> on<00:05:35.830> how<00:05:35.980> aggressively

00:05:36.750 --> 00:05:36.760 
just depending on how aggressively

00:05:36.760 --> 00:05:39.450 
just depending on how aggressively
you're<00:05:37.000> flying<00:05:37.330> we<00:05:38.200> do<00:05:38.320> have<00:05:38.440> a<00:05:38.500> on-off<00:05:39.130> switch

00:05:39.450 --> 00:05:39.460 
you're flying we do have a on-off switch

00:05:39.460 --> 00:05:41.940 
you're flying we do have a on-off switch
you<00:05:39.790> just<00:05:40.060> turn<00:05:40.240> this<00:05:40.420> thing<00:05:40.480> on<00:05:40.780> we<00:05:41.650> turn<00:05:41.800> it

00:05:41.940 --> 00:05:41.950 
you just turn this thing on we turn it

00:05:41.950 --> 00:05:43.500 
you just turn this thing on we turn it
on<00:05:42.070> we<00:05:42.250> have<00:05:42.340> a<00:05:42.370> little<00:05:42.580> flashing<00:05:43.030> red<00:05:43.270> light

00:05:43.500 --> 00:05:43.510 
on we have a little flashing red light

00:05:43.510 --> 00:05:47.450 
on we have a little flashing red light
and<00:05:43.690> once<00:05:44.170> we<00:05:44.320> pair<00:05:44.680> it<00:05:44.710> with<00:05:45.040> the<00:05:45.670> transmitter

00:05:47.450 --> 00:05:47.460 
and once we pair it with the transmitter

00:05:47.460 --> 00:05:50.550 
and once we pair it with the transmitter
that<00:05:48.460> light<00:05:48.760> will<00:05:48.940> go<00:05:49.120> between<00:05:49.300> like<00:05:50.110> a<00:05:50.140> blue

00:05:50.550 --> 00:05:50.560 
that light will go between like a blue

00:05:50.560 --> 00:05:51.530 
that light will go between like a blue
and

00:05:51.530 --> 00:05:51.540 
and

00:05:51.540 --> 00:05:54.170 
and
read<00:05:51.930> so<00:05:52.650> over<00:05:53.040> on<00:05:53.190> definitely<00:05:53.760> impressed

00:06:01.460 --> 00:06:01.470 
some extra props but I I've crashed this

00:06:01.470 --> 00:06:03.260 
some extra props but I I've crashed this
thing<00:06:01.650> a<00:06:01.740> few<00:06:01.980> times<00:06:02.160> it's<00:06:02.520> taking<00:06:02.850> some<00:06:02.970> hard

hits and it's still I'm fine with the

00:06:05.760 --> 00:06:07.790 
hits and it's still I'm fine with the
propellers<00:06:06.210> I<00:06:06.330> can<00:06:06.510> just<00:06:06.720> easily<00:06:07.050> bend<00:06:07.620> them

00:06:07.790 --> 00:06:07.800 
propellers I can just easily bend them
