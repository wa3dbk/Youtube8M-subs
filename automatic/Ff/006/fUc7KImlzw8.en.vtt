ACOG<00:00:24.449> is<00:00:24.779> really<00:00:25.680> cool<00:00:31.189> I<00:00:32.630> also<00:00:33.630> have<00:00:33.930> thermal

00:00:34.190 --> 00:00:34.200 
ACOG is really cool I also have thermal

00:00:34.200 --> 00:00:45.709 
ACOG is really cool I also have thermal
I<00:00:34.620> will<00:00:35.460> put<00:00:35.670> that<00:00:35.790> on<00:00:35.850> right<00:00:36.270> now<00:00:44.480> see<00:00:45.480> here's

00:00:45.709 --> 00:00:45.719

00:00:45.719 --> 00:00:47.420 
I will put that on right now see here's
what<00:00:45.930> it<00:00:46.140> looks<00:00:46.379> like<00:00:46.620> through<00:00:46.829> the<00:00:47.010> thermal

00:00:47.420 --> 00:00:47.430 
what it looks like through the thermal

00:00:47.430 --> 00:00:53.500 
what it looks like through the thermal
scope<00:00:47.820> I<00:00:50.719> colored<00:00:51.719> it<00:00:51.870> with<00:00:52.129> permanent<00:00:53.129> marker

00:00:53.500 --> 00:00:53.510 
scope I colored it with permanent marker

00:00:53.510 --> 00:00:59.060 
scope I colored it with permanent marker
so<00:00:55.460> yeah<00:00:56.460> it<00:00:56.910> just<00:00:57.329> slips<00:00:57.719> right<00:00:58.070> underneath

00:00:59.060 --> 00:00:59.070 
so yeah it just slips right underneath

00:00:59.070 --> 00:01:22.609
