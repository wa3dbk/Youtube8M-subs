with the chassis of a competition Cobra
roadster<00:00:44.820> and<00:00:45.030> you<00:00:45.629> could<00:00:45.809> evolve<00:00:46.739> it<00:00:46.980> into<00:00:47.070> a

00:00:47.270 --> 00:00:47.280 
roadster and you could evolve it into a

and<00:01:03.300> making<00:01:03.899> it<00:01:03.989> work<00:01:04.170> everything<00:01:04.799> that<00:01:05.100> was

00:01:05.210 --> 00:01:05.220 
and making it work everything that was

00:01:05.220 --> 00:01:06.890 
and making it work everything that was

tea-time transmission the main

00:01:18.270 --> 00:01:20.060 
tea-time transmission the main
difference<00:01:18.689> is<00:01:18.869> they<00:01:19.409> picked<00:01:19.680> up<00:01:19.799> a<00:01:19.890> lot<00:01:20.040> of

00:01:20.060 --> 00:01:20.070 
difference is they picked up a lot of

00:01:20.070 --> 00:01:22.910 
difference is they picked up a lot of
speed<00:01:21.060> out<00:01:21.240> of<00:01:21.270> the<00:01:21.420> slippery<00:01:21.960> coach<00:01:22.409> work<00:01:22.680> and

00:01:22.910 --> 00:01:22.920 
speed out of the slippery coach work and

00:01:22.920 --> 00:01:24.890 
speed out of the slippery coach work and
fuel<00:01:23.490> efficiency<00:01:23.580> which<00:01:24.150> is<00:01:24.270> very<00:01:24.450> important

00:01:24.890 --> 00:01:24.900 
fuel efficiency which is very important

00:01:24.900 --> 00:01:27.800 
fuel efficiency which is very important
to<00:01:25.049> for<00:01:25.320> endurance<00:01:25.830> races<00:01:26.159> in<00:01:26.280> Europe<00:01:26.570> so<00:01:27.570> the

to for endurance races in Europe so the

00:01:27.810 --> 00:01:29.929
