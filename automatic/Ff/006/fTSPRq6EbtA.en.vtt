video about the Honda Ridgeline and how

00:00:08.970 --> 00:00:10.310 
video about the Honda Ridgeline and how
to<00:00:09.030> automatically<00:00:09.690> roll<00:00:09.870> your<00:00:09.990> windows<00:00:10.290> down

00:00:10.310 --> 00:00:10.320 
to automatically roll your windows down

00:00:10.320 --> 00:00:12.709 
to automatically roll your windows down
with<00:00:10.740> the<00:00:10.889> remote<00:00:11.309> I<00:00:11.519> had<00:00:11.940> a<00:00:11.969> couple<00:00:12.630> people

00:00:12.709 --> 00:00:12.719 
with the remote I had a couple people

00:00:12.719 --> 00:00:16.070 
with the remote I had a couple people
asked<00:00:13.230> me<00:00:13.259> to<00:00:13.469> re<00:00:13.830> explain<00:00:14.309> how<00:00:14.759> to<00:00:14.929> turn<00:00:15.929> off

00:00:16.070 --> 00:00:16.080 
asked me to re explain how to turn off

00:00:16.080 --> 00:00:20.779 
asked me to re explain how to turn off
the<00:00:16.289> automatic<00:00:16.609> door<00:00:17.609> locking<00:00:17.910> feature<00:00:19.520> so<00:00:20.520> I

00:00:20.779 --> 00:00:20.789 
the automatic door locking feature so I

00:00:20.789 --> 00:00:22.730 
the automatic door locking feature so I
thought<00:00:21.029> the<00:00:21.359> best<00:00:21.510> way<00:00:21.600> to<00:00:21.720> be<00:00:21.930> is<00:00:22.289> just<00:00:22.350> run

00:00:22.730 --> 00:00:22.740 
thought the best way to be is just run

00:00:22.740 --> 00:00:26.779 
thought the best way to be is just run
through<00:00:22.920> it<00:00:23.070> one<00:00:23.250> time<00:00:25.220> so<00:00:26.220> basically<00:00:26.340> you

00:00:26.779 --> 00:00:26.789 
through it one time so basically you

00:00:26.789 --> 00:00:30.769 
through it one time so basically you
need<00:00:26.939> your<00:00:28.160> key<00:00:29.160> you<00:00:30.119> put<00:00:30.359> it<00:00:30.480> into<00:00:30.720> the

00:00:30.769 --> 00:00:30.779 
need your key you put it into the

00:00:30.779 --> 00:00:35.840 
need your key you put it into the
ignition<00:00:31.109> and<00:00:31.590> there's<00:00:32.279> um<00:00:32.579> a<00:00:34.040> zero<00:00:35.040> or<00:00:35.640> the

00:00:35.840 --> 00:00:35.850 
ignition and there's um a zero or the

00:00:35.850 --> 00:00:38.000 
ignition and there's um a zero or the
key<00:00:36.059> sets<00:00:36.420> dormant<00:00:37.380> or<00:00:37.469> you<00:00:37.559> can<00:00:37.649> take<00:00:37.770> it<00:00:37.920> out

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:38.010 
key sets dormant or you can take it out

00:00:38.010 --> 00:00:41.270 
key sets dormant or you can take it out
then<00:00:38.700> there's<00:00:38.879> a<00:00:38.969> 1<00:00:39.210> and<00:00:39.540> a<00:00:39.989> 2<00:00:40.020> 2<00:00:40.770> turns<00:00:41.070> on

00:00:41.270 --> 00:00:41.280 
then there's a 1 and a 2 2 turns on

00:00:41.280 --> 00:00:43.540 
then there's a 1 and a 2 2 turns on
there<00:00:41.579> and<00:00:41.790> if<00:00:41.910> that's<00:00:42.629> the<00:00:42.780> reason<00:00:43.020> all<00:00:43.140> that

00:00:43.540 --> 00:00:43.550 
there and if that's the reason all that

00:00:43.550 --> 00:00:48.440 
there and if that's the reason all that
so<00:00:44.550> what<00:00:44.700> you<00:00:44.789> do<00:00:44.910> is<00:00:45.030> you<00:00:45.350> turn<00:00:46.350> it<00:00:46.500> to<00:00:46.590> 2<00:00:47.450> and

00:00:48.440 --> 00:00:48.450 
so what you do is you turn it to 2 and

00:00:48.450 --> 00:00:50.900 
so what you do is you turn it to 2 and
leave<00:00:48.870> it<00:00:48.989> there<00:00:49.100> make<00:00:50.100> sure<00:00:50.129> the<00:00:50.399> car<00:00:50.610> is<00:00:50.640> in

00:00:50.900 --> 00:00:50.910 
leave it there make sure the car is in

00:00:50.910 --> 00:00:58.569 
leave it there make sure the car is in
park<00:00:51.270> and<00:00:52.760> then<00:00:53.760> apply<00:00:54.690> your<00:00:56.300> emergency<00:00:57.300> brake

00:00:58.569 --> 00:00:58.579

you'll hear it beep of course I didn't

00:01:26.549 --> 00:01:28.609 
you'll hear it beep of course I didn't
do<00:01:26.670> the<00:01:26.820> whole<00:01:27.030> thing<00:01:27.270> because<00:01:28.259> mine's

00:01:28.609 --> 00:01:28.619 
do the whole thing because mine's

00:01:28.619 --> 00:01:32.210 
do the whole thing because mine's
already<00:01:29.479> undone<00:01:30.479> that's<00:01:31.350> how<00:01:31.680> you<00:01:31.740> do<00:01:31.950> it<00:01:32.070> and

00:01:32.210 --> 00:01:32.220 
already undone that's how you do it and

00:01:32.220 --> 00:01:35.539 
already undone that's how you do it and
it<00:01:32.369> turns<00:01:32.640> the<00:01:33.200> auto<00:01:34.200> locking<00:01:34.560> function<00:01:35.250> off

00:01:35.539 --> 00:01:35.549 
it turns the auto locking function off

00:01:35.549 --> 00:01:38.030 
it turns the auto locking function off
so<00:01:36.210> that<00:01:36.259> when<00:01:37.259> you<00:01:37.350> drive<00:01:37.560> down<00:01:37.740> the<00:01:37.799> road

00:01:38.030 --> 00:01:38.040 
so that when you drive down the road

00:01:38.040 --> 00:01:41.539 
so that when you drive down the road
your<00:01:38.250> doors<00:01:38.460> won't<00:01:38.729> dumb<00:01:40.430> you<00:01:41.430> know

00:01:41.539 --> 00:01:41.549 
your doors won't dumb you know

00:01:41.549 --> 00:01:42.889 
your doors won't dumb you know
automatically<00:01:42.210> lock<00:01:42.420> and<00:01:42.720> the<00:01:42.780> new

00:01:42.889 --> 00:01:42.899 
automatically lock and the new

00:01:42.899 --> 00:01:45.380 
automatically lock and the new
passengers<00:01:43.500> have<00:01:43.680> to<00:01:43.860> manually<00:01:44.759> unlock<00:01:45.000> the

00:01:45.380 --> 00:01:45.390 
passengers have to manually unlock the

00:01:45.390 --> 00:01:47.030 
passengers have to manually unlock the
door<00:01:45.600> you<00:01:45.869> have<00:01:45.899> to<00:01:46.049> unlock<00:01:46.350> it<00:01:46.560> for<00:01:46.770> them<00:01:46.920> with

00:01:47.030 --> 00:01:47.040 
door you have to unlock it for them with

00:01:47.040 --> 00:01:50.359 
door you have to unlock it for them with
the<00:01:47.189> uh<00:01:47.780> by<00:01:48.780> hitting<00:01:49.020> this<00:01:49.290> which<00:01:49.799> gets<00:01:50.070> really

00:01:50.359 --> 00:01:50.369 
the uh by hitting this which gets really

00:01:50.369 --> 00:01:53.389 
the uh by hitting this which gets really
really<00:01:50.790> annoying<00:01:51.060> and<00:01:52.159> there's<00:01:53.159> a<00:01:53.250> way<00:01:53.369> to

00:01:53.389 --> 00:01:53.399 
really annoying and there's a way to

00:01:53.399 --> 00:01:56.899 
really annoying and there's a way to
turn<00:01:53.640> it<00:01:53.700> back<00:01:53.939> on<00:01:53.970> if<00:01:54.390> you<00:01:54.509> want<00:01:54.720> it<00:01:54.810> on<00:01:54.930> and<00:01:55.909> I

00:01:56.899 --> 00:01:56.909 
turn it back on if you want it on and I

00:01:56.909 --> 00:01:59.330 
turn it back on if you want it on and I
think<00:01:57.180> this<00:01:57.540> works<00:01:57.780> with<00:01:57.990> most<00:01:58.979> of<00:01:59.250> the

00:01:59.330 --> 00:01:59.340 
think this works with most of the

00:01:59.340 --> 00:02:01.249 
think this works with most of the
Honda's<00:01:59.850> that<00:02:00.540> have<00:02:00.689> the<00:02:00.810> auto<00:02:00.960> locking

00:02:01.249 --> 00:02:01.259 
Honda's that have the auto locking

00:02:01.259 --> 00:02:03.649 
Honda's that have the auto locking
feature<00:02:01.619> so<00:02:02.000> if<00:02:03.000> you've<00:02:03.180> got<00:02:03.329> that<00:02:03.390> auto

00:02:03.649 --> 00:02:03.659 
feature so if you've got that auto

00:02:03.659 --> 00:02:04.789 
feature so if you've got that auto
locking<00:02:03.930> feature<00:02:04.200> and<00:02:04.380> you<00:02:04.439> don't<00:02:04.619> like<00:02:04.770> it

00:02:04.789 --> 00:02:04.799 
locking feature and you don't like it

00:02:04.799 --> 00:02:06.530 
locking feature and you don't like it
you<00:02:05.280> know<00:02:05.399> give<00:02:05.579> that<00:02:05.759> a<00:02:05.790> try<00:02:06.000> and<00:02:06.149> see<00:02:06.390> if<00:02:06.479> it

00:02:06.530 --> 00:02:06.540 
you know give that a try and see if it

00:02:06.540 --> 00:02:08.690 
you know give that a try and see if it
works<00:02:06.750> if<00:02:07.170> it<00:02:07.350> doesn't<00:02:07.770> there<00:02:08.459> might<00:02:08.670> be

00:02:08.690 --> 00:02:08.700 
works if it doesn't there might be

00:02:08.700 --> 00:02:10.609 
works if it doesn't there might be
another<00:02:08.970> sequence<00:02:09.479> you<00:02:09.660> have<00:02:09.690> to<00:02:10.050> do<00:02:10.200> for<00:02:10.470> your

00:02:10.609 --> 00:02:10.619 
another sequence you have to do for your

00:02:10.619 --> 00:02:12.480 
another sequence you have to do for your
vehicle<00:02:11.069> so<00:02:11.760> you<00:02:12.180> know

00:02:12.480 --> 00:02:12.490 
vehicle so you know

00:02:12.490 --> 00:02:15.030 
vehicle so you know
check<00:02:12.910> with<00:02:13.030> your<00:02:13.090> dealer<00:02:13.570> or<00:02:13.750> your<00:02:14.080> manual<00:02:14.950> if

00:02:15.030 --> 00:02:15.040 
check with your dealer or your manual if

00:02:15.040 --> 00:02:19.380 
check with your dealer or your manual if
you<00:02:15.160> have<00:02:15.310> one<00:02:15.840> all<00:02:16.840> right<00:02:16.960> take<00:02:17.350> care
