00:00:00.079 --> 00:00:04.770
 staff I smiled and in the oil video 

00:00:02.669 --> 00:00:07.230
 talk a little bit about what the 

00:00:04.770 --> 00:00:09.410
 Americans here in the 

00:00:07.230 --> 00:00:09.410
 California 

00:00:11.269 --> 00:00:16.080
 so I talk a little bit about today 

00:00:13.349 --> 00:00:17.760
 How are Americans especially here? 

00:00:16.080 --> 00:00:19.890
 in the state of california that is where I 

00:00:17.760 --> 00:00:21.689
 I lived where I have more contact with him. 

00:00:19.890 --> 00:00:24.060
 one thing that I think makes a difference 

00:00:21.689 --> 00:00:27.090
 few Californians from other regions 

00:00:24.060 --> 00:00:29.640
 of the United States is that they are 

00:00:27.090 --> 00:00:32.189
 people, let's say more open is 

00:00:29.640 --> 00:00:33.809
 they are more conducive to for example 

00:00:32.189 --> 00:00:36.600
 talk to strangers 

00:00:33.809 --> 00:00:38.010
 funny yes because the account situations 

00:00:36.600 --> 00:00:40.620
 where the times you are at the point of 

00:00:38.010 --> 00:00:43.920
 bus and someone else makes a 

00:00:40.620 --> 00:00:44.760
 question with space here is the bus going 

00:00:43.920 --> 00:00:47.969
 to where 

00:00:44.760 --> 00:00:50.789
 and you respond to everyone is to rent or 

00:00:47.969 --> 00:00:53.430
 such another years passes here and they 

00:00:50.789 --> 00:00:54.840
 continue conversations they want 

00:00:53.430 --> 00:00:57.030
 hold a conversation because they found 

00:00:54.840 --> 00:00:59.340
 cool because they found different them 

00:00:57.030 --> 00:01:01.050
 They want to talk to you and it 's not 

00:00:59.340 --> 00:01:02.879
 that thing that looks like a conversation 

00:01:01.050 --> 00:01:05.309
 forced or even because the person is 

00:01:02.879 --> 00:01:07.619
 wanting to xeretar your life is that they 

00:01:05.309 --> 00:01:10.049
 they are very open mainly to 

00:01:07.619 --> 00:01:12.900
 Foreigners are not people because they do not 

00:01:10.049 --> 00:01:15.180
 they know they like to talk to 

00:01:12.900 --> 00:01:16.850
 more warm people say so 

00:01:15.180 --> 00:01:20.400
 they run away from that stereotype 

00:01:16.850 --> 00:01:23.130
 people of very cold and 

00:01:20.400 --> 00:01:25.680
 then a characteristic reserved 

00:01:23.130 --> 00:01:28.680
 so they are very open and 

00:01:25.680 --> 00:01:31.740
 they are very educated so too with 

00:01:28.680 --> 00:01:33.840
 people and talking about the issue of 

00:01:31.740 --> 00:01:37.110
 education and I think this also 

00:01:33.840 --> 00:01:39.030
 repeats in several other places but they 

00:01:37.110 --> 00:01:41.430
 they treat people very well they have 

00:01:39.030 --> 00:01:43.380
 great consideration for the next 

00:01:41.430 --> 00:01:45.450
 for example if you are entering a 

00:01:43.380 --> 00:01:47.549
 place and has someone leaving the person going 

00:01:45.450 --> 00:01:51.119
 hold the door but you can pass 

00:01:47.549 --> 00:01:53.460
 to close then or if you are 

00:01:51.119 --> 00:01:56.490
 leaving and someone will enter you safe to 

00:01:53.460 --> 00:01:58.350
 door the person will say thank you 

00:01:56.490 --> 00:02:01.229
 and if you bump into someone on the street 

00:01:58.350 --> 00:02:02.579
 person to apologize and if the person 

00:02:01.229 --> 00:02:05.310
 You need to pass and you're on the way. 

00:02:02.579 --> 00:02:07.590
 She'll excuse me, so here she is. 

00:02:05.310 --> 00:02:10.200
 much culture of consideration for the 

00:02:07.590 --> 00:02:11.560
 should be educated with the people 

00:02:10.200 --> 00:02:13.360
 something else about 

00:02:11.560 --> 00:02:15.220
 Americans here from California is that I 

00:02:13.360 --> 00:02:17.410
 I think they are much more 

00:02:15.220 --> 00:02:20.020
 Liberals, shall we say so? 

00:02:17.410 --> 00:02:22.930
 they are people that they are open to 

00:02:20.020 --> 00:02:24.640
 new ideas new cultures even because the 

00:02:22.930 --> 00:02:27.819
 a state that has a 

00:02:24.640 --> 00:02:30.430
 very large cultural miscegenation 

00:02:27.819 --> 00:02:33.880
 they are always open to new cultures 

00:02:30.430 --> 00:02:36.250
 new ideas and they did not 

00:02:33.880 --> 00:02:39.420
 persons by appearances or by modes of 

00:02:36.250 --> 00:02:41.800
 investing other sexuality for example 

00:02:39.420 --> 00:02:44.080
 So you can go out the way you do. 

00:02:41.800 --> 00:02:46.239
 you want and you see people dressed in the street 

00:02:44.080 --> 00:02:49.060
 from everything to the form of the most exotic 

00:02:46.239 --> 00:02:51.880
 so more formal and you do not ten people 

00:02:49.060 --> 00:02:54.010
 judging them by the way they are 

00:02:51.880 --> 00:02:55.690
 wearing usually they will play if 

00:02:54.010 --> 00:02:59.080
 Are you cool or not? 

00:02:55.690 --> 00:03:01.540
 and if you're educated or not but we 

00:02:59.080 --> 00:03:03.849
 do not see very often the 

00:03:01.540 --> 00:03:05.230
 people throwing each other through the 

00:03:03.849 --> 00:03:07.060
 way of dressing 

00:03:05.230 --> 00:03:09.099
 Of course I 'm referring to environments. 

00:03:07.060 --> 00:03:11.530
 the more informal it is when it has a 

00:03:09.099 --> 00:03:14.410
 more formal than you who have a dress 

00:03:11.530 --> 00:03:17.400
 code strictest people have to 

00:03:14.410 --> 00:03:19.930
 abstained according to that occasion 

00:03:17.400 --> 00:03:22.079
 but what happens if you see on the street the 

00:03:19.930 --> 00:03:24.910
 detained were the most exotic 

00:03:22.079 --> 00:03:26.890
 possible mainly because they are 

00:03:24.910 --> 00:03:29.700
 francisco is a city has a lot of 

00:03:26.890 --> 00:03:32.230
 influence of gay culture of hip culture 

00:03:29.700 --> 00:03:34.090
 So you can be the way you are. 

00:03:32.230 --> 00:03:36.040
 do not want anyone else to judge you 

00:03:34.090 --> 00:03:38.620
 so people have a 

00:03:36.040 --> 00:03:40.690
 very great freedom to be them. 

00:03:38.620 --> 00:03:42.970
 said misch how are they 

00:03:40.690 --> 00:03:45.130
 they want so people do not judge 

00:03:42.970 --> 00:03:47.470
 another very cool thing about 

00:03:45.130 --> 00:03:49.989
 Americans here from California is that they 

00:03:47.470 --> 00:03:52.150
 they have a culture of trying to keep 

00:03:49.989 --> 00:03:54.340
 a healthier nerd practice life 

00:03:52.150 --> 00:03:57.130
 sports and eating more 

00:03:54.340 --> 00:03:59.139
 balanced course that has quite fast 

00:03:57.130 --> 00:04:01.359
 food has lots of people who live fast 

00:03:59.139 --> 00:04:03.819
 food but what we see that many 

00:04:01.359 --> 00:04:06.220
 people they always look for markets 

00:04:03.819 --> 00:04:08.170
 organic and healthier foods more 

00:04:06.220 --> 00:04:10.420
 to maintain a healthy diet 

00:04:08.170 --> 00:04:12.760
 balanced and he also practices 

00:04:10.420 --> 00:04:15.940
 quite a lot of sport exercises 

00:04:12.760 --> 00:04:17.980
 you see right in the parks and on the streets the 

00:04:15.940 --> 00:04:21.040
 people running walking 

00:04:17.980 --> 00:04:24.850
 and here also the direct paid them 

00:04:21.040 --> 00:04:26.980
 offer free yoga classes then you have 

00:04:24.850 --> 00:04:30.250
 enough sense of earnings so a 

00:04:26.980 --> 00:04:33.370
 healthy life is a life more more 

00:04:30.250 --> 00:04:35.020
 balanced and they are people that they 

00:04:33.370 --> 00:04:38.020
 love the outdoors 

00:04:35.020 --> 00:04:40.150
 I love the contact with nature 

00:04:38.020 --> 00:04:42.880
 another cool thing here that we see 

00:04:40.150 --> 00:04:45.610
 they respect the laws very much. 

00:04:42.880 --> 00:04:48.310
 so you do not see anyone 

00:04:45.610 --> 00:04:51.330
 chicken is very hard so you see 

00:04:48.310 --> 00:04:54.400
 someone sticking red sign someone 

00:04:51.330 --> 00:04:57.400
 when should I stop when 

00:04:54.400 --> 00:04:59.860
 have a stop sign and they always will. 

00:04:57.400 --> 00:05:02.140
 they always respect pedestrians very much 

00:04:59.860 --> 00:05:05.080
 rarely happens another that is half 

00:05:02.140 --> 00:05:08.080
 who is more barber and does not respect the 

00:05:05.080 --> 00:05:10.360
 pds but yes when I have to the pms to 

00:05:08.080 --> 00:05:13.300
 street they stop waiting person to 

00:05:10.360 --> 00:05:16.570
 they are not cutting each other in 

00:05:13.300 --> 00:05:20.020
 a sign crossing and they are 

00:05:16.570 --> 00:05:22.840
 people without very polite in traffic and 

00:05:20.020 --> 00:05:23.950
 they too respect the laws of 

00:05:22.840 --> 00:05:26.050
 Traffic 

00:05:23.950 --> 00:05:28.030
 but of course everything is not perfect in 

00:05:26.050 --> 00:05:31.630
 so before b also enough things 

00:05:28.030 --> 00:05:34.060
 here as well as for 

00:05:31.630 --> 00:05:36.640
 example the prejudice here is still very 

00:05:34.060 --> 00:05:39.310
 very strong is very striking 

00:05:36.640 --> 00:05:42.430
 and of course not only here as a large part 

00:05:39.310 --> 00:05:45.940
 the United States and we see 

00:05:42.430 --> 00:05:49.630
 Yes, social distinction, of segregation. 

00:05:45.940 --> 00:05:52.060
 So let's say the neighborhoods exist 

00:05:49.630 --> 00:05:53.080
 the neighborhood is just rich neighborhood house of 

00:05:52.060 --> 00:05:55.180
 poor 

00:05:53.080 --> 00:05:57.160
 the neighborhood that only soy that has to 

00:05:55.180 --> 00:06:00.240
 most of American the neighborhood that is 

00:05:57.160 --> 00:06:02.290
 only Japanese and the neighborhood is just from there 

00:06:00.240 --> 00:06:05.140
 Mexicans and Latinos 

00:06:02.290 --> 00:06:08.670
 so it still has very strong segregation 

00:06:05.140 --> 00:06:12.310
 Here I find a shame though sam 

00:06:08.670 --> 00:06:14.230
 makhele to be a state with enough 

00:06:12.310 --> 00:06:16.870
 this cultural nation it is still well 

00:06:14.230 --> 00:06:18.790
 the issue of segregation by 

00:06:16.870 --> 00:06:21.430
 social groups the issue of misery 

00:06:18.790 --> 00:06:23.500
 It's also a big factor here. 

00:06:21.430 --> 00:06:27.760
 In São Francisco we see a lot without 

00:06:23.500 --> 00:06:28.370
 very beggar ceiling and that even worse 

00:06:27.760 --> 00:06:29.870
 situation here 

00:06:28.370 --> 00:06:33.979
 many of them often are 

00:06:29.870 --> 00:06:36.199
 coarse and are worthy and rude and 

00:06:33.979 --> 00:06:40.010
 they catch buses and they keep screaming 

00:06:36.199 --> 00:06:43.550
 on the bus or start arguing with 

00:06:40.010 --> 00:06:45.590
 another person for no reason so I guess 

00:06:43.550 --> 00:06:47.930
 This connection issue makes him the 

00:06:45.590 --> 00:06:49.190
 people plus more foods so more 

00:06:47.930 --> 00:06:51.080
 harsh 

00:06:49.190 --> 00:06:53.870
 here there is a lot that has a lot 

00:06:51.080 --> 00:06:57.100
 mainly on street harassment 

00:06:53.870 --> 00:07:00.070
 neighborhoods considered more 

00:06:57.100 --> 00:07:02.630
 suburban right I do not know if the right word 

00:07:00.070 --> 00:07:05.110
 but takes place takes place in five years 

00:07:02.630 --> 00:07:07.539
 You pass and the men simply 

00:07:05.110 --> 00:07:09.919
 too much women and girls 

00:07:07.539 --> 00:07:12.530
 so you're always has to take 

00:07:09.919 --> 00:07:14.720
 very careful and depending on the region 

00:07:12.530 --> 00:07:16.550
 of the city that we are going to walk 

00:07:14.720 --> 00:07:19.660
 basically this question of 

00:07:16.550 --> 00:07:22.340
 segregation neves you see that there are neighborhoods 

00:07:19.660 --> 00:07:25.699
 specific for each group 

00:07:22.340 --> 00:07:28.550
 for each group of people and that 

00:07:25.699 --> 00:07:31.190
 I think it's kind of complicated , but this is 

00:07:28.550 --> 00:07:33.020
 common in most states 

00:07:31.190 --> 00:07:36.220
 united and I think this issue of 

00:07:33.020 --> 00:07:38.960
 social segregation bias here 

00:07:36.220 --> 00:07:40.550
 I think it will not end so soon 

00:07:38.960 --> 00:07:41.930
 from reality as well as from 

00:07:40.550 --> 00:07:43.970
 is there in Brazil 

00:07:41.930 --> 00:07:46.090
