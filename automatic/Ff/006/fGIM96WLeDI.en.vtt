00:00:04.340 --> 00:00:09.650
 how about friends this is the world of 

00:00:07.140 --> 00:00:09.650
 head 

00:00:19.360 --> 00:00:22.770
 you will brazil 

00:00:23.320 --> 00:00:28.210
 the community of araras in sao paulo 

00:00:25.960 --> 00:00:31.450
 Brazil has the largest population 

00:00:28.210 --> 00:00:34.360
 world of people suffering a rare 

00:00:31.450 --> 00:00:37.379
 skin disease known as 

00:00:34.360 --> 00:00:37.379
 xeroderma pigmentosum 

00:00:39.740 --> 00:00:44.990
 It is a severe disease 

00:00:41.710 --> 00:00:47.600
 hereditary causing in the victim 

00:00:44.990 --> 00:00:51.100
 extreme sensitivity to lightning 

00:00:47.600 --> 00:00:51.100
 ultraviolet of the sun 

00:00:54.260 --> 00:00:59.870
 the damage done to the skin by this 

00:00:57.079 --> 00:01:02.589
 disease is practically impossible to 

00:00:59.870 --> 00:01:02.589
 repair 

00:01:03.570 --> 00:01:09.180
 it is established that the carriers of this 

00:01:06.060 --> 00:01:13.310
 disease are highly susceptible to 

00:01:09.180 --> 00:01:13.310
 suffer from skin cancer 

00:01:13.940 --> 00:01:20.360
 the statistics are revealing 1 of 

00:01:17.420 --> 00:01:23.660
 every 40 inhabitants of the region suffer 

00:01:20.360 --> 00:01:26.270
 of this disease really very 

00:01:23.660 --> 00:01:30.200
 superior to the cases presented in the 

00:01:26.270 --> 00:01:33.100
 USA where the incidence rate is 1 

00:01:30.200 --> 00:01:33.100
 per million 

00:01:35.210 --> 00:01:40.610
 and as every cause has a reason why 

00:01:38.210 --> 00:01:43.030
 population of araras was founded by 

00:01:40.610 --> 00:01:46.070
 families with carriers of the disease 

00:01:43.030 --> 00:01:48.290
 in this way the disease went away 

00:01:46.070 --> 00:01:50.409
 transmitting from generation to 

00:01:48.290 --> 00:01:50.409
 generation 

00:01:53.450 --> 00:01:58.610
 one of the textual statements by 

00:01:55.969 --> 00:02:01.219
 part of a victim of the disease is 

00:01:58.610 --> 00:02:02.420
 the next the sun is our worst 

00:02:01.219 --> 00:02:04.429
 enemy 

00:02:02.420 --> 00:02:07.390
 those affected we must change the day by 

00:02:04.429 --> 00:02:11.420
 the night to be able to live longer 

00:02:07.390 --> 00:02:13.510
 unfortunately this is not possible 

00:02:11.420 --> 00:02:16.010
 as these statements indicate 

00:02:13.510 --> 00:02:19.099
 it's really hard to survive with 

00:02:16.010 --> 00:02:21.110
 the disease and even more knowing that 

00:02:19.099 --> 00:02:24.700
 most of the inhabitants are engaged 

00:02:21.110 --> 00:02:24.700
 to agricultural work 

00:02:26.580 --> 00:02:31.380
 meanwhile throughout these years 

00:02:29.010 --> 00:02:33.300
 the population has been conscious in 

00:02:31.380 --> 00:02:36.490
 regarding security measures and 

00:02:33.300 --> 00:02:42.270
 disease prevention 

00:02:36.490 --> 00:02:42.270
 this is the world of good night head
