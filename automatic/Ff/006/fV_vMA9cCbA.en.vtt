 small street that is called eros pérez the law 

00:02:38.020 --> 00:02:42.970
 it's a street representing that it was the 

00:02:40.360 --> 00:02:45.250
 colonial life but it has been continuously 

00:02:42.970 --> 00:02:47.770
 lived or inhabited since that time 

00:02:45.250 --> 00:02:51.760
 colonial until now then we were in 

00:02:47.770 --> 00:02:53.860

00:02:51.760 --> 00:02:58.570

00:03:03.100 --> 00:03:10.450
 hall of independence that then there is 

00:03:06.580 --> 00:03:12.100
 where it was written where the 

00:03:10.450 --> 00:03:15.160
 declaration of independence and also 

00:03:12.100 --> 00:03:16.090

00:03:15.160 --> 00:03:18.760
 the Americans 

00:03:16.090 --> 00:03:21.130
 this is sacred place because precisely 

00:03:18.760 --> 00:03:24.730
 because it is the cradle of the country is here 

00:03:21.130 --> 00:03:27.670

00:03:24.730 --> 00:03:28.900

00:03:27.670 --> 00:03:30.760
