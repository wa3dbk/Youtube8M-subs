00:00:29.439 --> 00:00:29.449 
top some worms can have air I also put a

00:00:29.449 --> 00:00:32.630 
top some worms can have air I also put a
1-1<00:00:30.449> drainage<00:00:30.810> hole<00:00:31.019> to<00:00:31.109> the<00:00:31.140> bottom<00:00:31.529> for<00:00:32.520> now

00:00:32.630 --> 00:00:32.640 
1-1 drainage hole to the bottom for now

00:00:32.640 --> 00:00:34.190 
1-1 drainage hole to the bottom for now
I'm<00:00:32.820> going<00:00:32.880> to<00:00:33.059> figure<00:00:33.300> out<00:00:33.390> what<00:00:33.570> to<00:00:33.600> do<00:00:33.870> once

00:00:34.190 --> 00:00:34.200 
I'm going to figure out what to do once

00:00:34.200 --> 00:00:35.810 
I'm going to figure out what to do once
it<00:00:34.380> gets<00:00:34.559> started<00:00:34.620> I<00:00:35.070> might<00:00:35.280> put<00:00:35.640> a<00:00:35.670> little

00:00:35.810 --> 00:00:35.820 
it gets started I might put a little

00:00:35.820 --> 00:00:37.610 
it gets started I might put a little
spigot<00:00:36.180> in<00:00:36.420> the<00:00:36.540> air<00:00:36.630> or<00:00:36.930> some<00:00:37.170> kind<00:00:37.380> of<00:00:37.440> a

00:00:37.610 --> 00:00:37.620 
spigot in the air or some kind of a

00:00:37.620 --> 00:00:39.740 
spigot in the air or some kind of a
drainage<00:00:38.550> holes<00:00:38.790> and<00:00:39.090> figure<00:00:39.360> out<00:00:39.390> a<00:00:39.510> system

00:00:39.740 --> 00:00:39.750 
drainage holes and figure out a system

00:00:39.750 --> 00:00:45.709 
drainage holes and figure out a system
for<00:00:40.110> that<00:00:43.100> all<00:00:44.100> right<00:00:44.370> so<00:00:45.149> we're<00:00:45.510> going<00:00:45.629> to

00:00:45.709 --> 00:00:45.719 
for that all right so we're going to

00:00:45.719 --> 00:00:49.670 
for that all right so we're going to
start<00:00:46.160> with<00:00:47.160> some<00:00:47.430> shredded<00:00:48.239> cardboard<00:00:48.680> I'm

00:00:49.670 --> 00:00:49.680 
start with some shredded cardboard I'm

00:00:49.680 --> 00:00:55.189 
start with some shredded cardboard I'm
going<00:00:49.920> to<00:00:49.980> put<00:00:50.129> in<00:00:50.219> the<00:00:50.280> bottom<00:00:50.579> of<00:00:50.640> the<00:00:50.730> vin<00:00:54.199> as

00:00:55.189 --> 00:00:55.199 
going to put in the bottom of the vin as

00:00:55.199 --> 00:01:02.240 
going to put in the bottom of the vin as
a<00:00:55.260> bedding<00:01:00.199> hopefully<00:01:01.199> that<00:01:01.379> will<00:01:01.469> help<00:01:01.829> soak

00:01:02.240 --> 00:01:02.250 
a bedding hopefully that will help soak

00:01:02.250 --> 00:01:09.410 
a bedding hopefully that will help soak
up<00:01:02.430> some<00:01:02.760> of<00:01:02.789> the<00:01:04.100> worm<00:01:05.360> p<00:01:06.360> drainage<00:01:07.610> and<00:01:08.610> then

00:01:09.410 --> 00:01:09.420 
up some of the worm p drainage and then

00:01:09.420 --> 00:01:13.100 
up some of the worm p drainage and then
i've<00:01:09.540> got<00:01:09.570> a<00:01:09.720> bunch<00:01:09.780> of<00:01:10.110> shredded<00:01:11.010> paper<00:01:12.110> and
