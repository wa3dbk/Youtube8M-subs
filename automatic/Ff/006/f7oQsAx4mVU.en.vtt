00:00:16.560 --> 00:00:23.170
 a few drops of this color 

00:00:20.920 --> 00:00:24.610

00:00:23.170 --> 00:00:27.340
 videos that I will be doing 

00:00:24.610 --> 00:00:30.670
 using different boots already have 

00:00:27.340 --> 00:00:33.280
 in black tone this color I also have 

00:00:30.670 --> 00:00:35.140

00:00:35.140 --> 00:00:40.059
 What I want is to give you ideas of how 

00:00:37.030 --> 00:00:42.460

00:00:40.059 --> 00:00:45.250
 ideas you already know that you can 

00:00:42.460 --> 00:00:47.530
 adapt to your wardrobe style to 

00:00:45.250 --> 00:00:50.739
 the colors that they like tell you such 

00:00:47.530 --> 00:00:53.440
 that looks fatal because you take it off 

00:00:50.739 --> 00:00:56.140
 and they say oh how this was missing 

00:00:53.440 --> 00:00:58.629
 you do not add are free to do 

00:00:56.140 --> 00:01:00.280
 whatever they want with the ideas that I give them 

00:00:58.629 --> 00:01:02.769
 I give as I tell you they are simply 

00:01:00.280 --> 00:01:05.740
 examples but I hope you can 

00:01:02.769 --> 00:01:08.049

00:01:21.780 --> 00:01:24.260
 Y 

00:01:25.210 --> 00:01:30.310
 beautiful this is the first one that I am 

00:01:28.600 --> 00:01:33.820
 using the drops that you already 

00:01:30.310 --> 00:01:36.610
 could appreciate super super good I'm 

00:01:33.820 --> 00:01:38.710
 using this floral pants and what 

00:01:36.610 --> 00:01:41.350
 that I recommend using a 

00:01:38.710 --> 00:01:44.290
 striped trousers with striped trousers 

00:01:41.350 --> 00:01:47.229
 a trouser with points with whatever it is 

00:01:44.290 --> 00:01:50.409
 that you wear a blouse that is in tone 

00:01:47.229 --> 00:01:53.200
 neutral so that you can do like that 

00:01:50.409 --> 00:01:55.000
 Balance in all your outfit if your pants 

00:01:53.200 --> 00:01:57.729
 of flowers has another good color you 

00:01:55.000 --> 00:02:00.220
 you take a color that is in your pants 

00:01:57.729 --> 00:02:03.460
 true in this case I 'm using you 

00:02:00.220 --> 00:02:06.820
 this blouse that is a beige tone because 

00:02:03.460 --> 00:02:09.519
 the pants have it then it was made 

00:02:06.820 --> 00:02:12.370
 that was also a good as I say a 

00:02:09.519 --> 00:02:14.550
 good balance for this auto it so 

00:02:12.370 --> 00:02:16.460
 this is the car that I am using 

00:02:14.550 --> 00:02:19.100
 these two bracelets 

00:02:16.460 --> 00:02:21.560
 this one that says the side and this one that's 

00:02:19.100 --> 00:02:25.870
 little super simple earrings 

00:02:21.560 --> 00:02:29.140
 because this blouse brings this collar 

00:02:25.870 --> 00:02:31.060
 spiderman then I would not wear 

00:02:29.140 --> 00:02:33.610
 a necklace because it would be because 

00:02:31.060 --> 00:02:36.940
 too much then this is the first 

00:02:33.610 --> 00:02:39.030
 help and we go with the next 

00:02:36.940 --> 00:02:39.030
 i 

00:02:42.860 --> 00:02:47.090
 what manuel 

00:02:49.680 --> 00:02:56.670
 beautiful this is the second option that 

00:02:53.489 --> 00:02:58.469
 I give them I hope it is to your liking and if 

00:02:56.670 --> 00:03:00.120
 you can not already know you can 

00:02:58.469 --> 00:03:03.090
 change what you want me 

00:03:00.120 --> 00:03:05.700
 I'm just like that the example but 

00:03:03.090 --> 00:03:08.609
 you do what you want with the 

00:03:05.700 --> 00:03:11.909
 outfits then I'm proposing is 

00:03:08.609 --> 00:03:15.359
 wear a mint pants with boots 

00:03:11.909 --> 00:03:17.579
 to put some as heaters in 

00:03:15.359 --> 00:03:22.139
 English because they are called warners or 

00:03:17.579 --> 00:03:25.260
 long socks in brown tone and for this 

00:03:22.139 --> 00:03:29.159
 I'm using a brown jacket 

00:03:25.260 --> 00:03:31.139
 also so that it is there apart from that 

00:03:29.159 --> 00:03:33.720
 we can not put it either as a 

00:03:31.139 --> 00:03:36.719
 black color or other color I'm sorry that 

00:03:33.720 --> 00:03:40.469
 rather go with the neutrals in this 

00:03:36.719 --> 00:03:42.090
 case the centerpiece would be the pants 

00:03:40.469 --> 00:03:45.330
 mint 

00:03:42.090 --> 00:03:48.180
 and I'm using warm colors like 

00:03:45.330 --> 00:03:50.940
 this one is a beige color that is 

00:03:48.180 --> 00:03:53.970
 a brown color that goes to the boots 

00:03:50.940 --> 00:03:55.709
 then this is my proposal but 

00:03:53.970 --> 00:03:58.590
 you can change any color 

00:03:55.709 --> 00:04:01.220
 that you do not like it so we go with the 

00:03:58.590 --> 00:04:01.220
 following 

00:04:06.740 --> 00:04:10.860
 enmanuel 

00:04:08.010 --> 00:04:14.250
 for this next option I give the 

00:04:10.860 --> 00:04:17.220
 idea to use everything in black in your 

00:04:14.250 --> 00:04:19.260
 dress either a dress a skirt 

00:04:17.220 --> 00:04:22.320
 a blouse in this case I'm 

00:04:19.260 --> 00:04:24.900
 using leggings with a black blouse and 

00:04:22.320 --> 00:04:25.320
 only the boots are from another 

00:04:24.900 --> 00:04:27.539
 tone 

00:04:25.320 --> 00:04:29.820
 this combination the truth is that it is 

00:04:27.539 --> 00:04:32.190
 my favorites and I'm using a 

00:04:29.820 --> 00:04:34.710
 necklace that brings some stones in the tone 

00:04:32.190 --> 00:04:37.650
 of the boots but they can add a 

00:04:34.710 --> 00:04:40.230
 necklace in a golden tone as it combines 

00:04:37.650 --> 00:04:42.720
 very good with the tone of the boots 

00:04:40.230 --> 00:04:46.950
 another option that I give them right here 

00:04:42.720 --> 00:04:48.990
 true is to use a color cardigan 

00:04:46.950 --> 00:04:52.290
 that you want or think that 

00:04:48.990 --> 00:04:55.110
 combine in this case I will use this 

00:04:52.290 --> 00:04:57.780
 that I really love is super 

00:04:55.110 --> 00:05:00.960
 super super warm for this 

00:04:57.780 --> 00:05:04.100
 season and good here brings to be able 

00:05:00.960 --> 00:05:06.650
 get like this 

00:05:04.100 --> 00:05:10.550
 and then I give it like another 

00:05:06.650 --> 00:05:14.410
 style to this same outfit I always to 

00:05:10.550 --> 00:05:17.690
 this cardio what I do is take this 

00:05:14.410 --> 00:05:19.910
 because I did not fasten it just 

00:05:17.690 --> 00:05:24.080
 let's increase it there simply 

00:05:19.910 --> 00:05:26.210
 He left it that way and I like it a lot 

00:05:24.080 --> 00:05:30.230
 It can also be used with laws 

00:05:26.210 --> 00:05:34.090
 even but the long shirt then 

00:05:30.230 --> 00:05:34.090
 this is the idea that
