fitness for life and today we're going
to<00:00:04.529> discuss<00:00:04.819> weight<00:00:05.819> training<00:00:06.299> for<00:00:06.720> soccer

00:00:08.020 --> 00:00:08.030 
to discuss weight training for soccer

00:00:08.030 --> 00:00:10.310 
to discuss weight training for soccer
there<00:00:09.030> are<00:00:09.210> a<00:00:09.240> variety<00:00:09.599> of<00:00:09.840> different<00:00:09.960> moves

00:00:10.310 --> 00:00:10.320 
there are a variety of different moves

00:00:10.320 --> 00:00:14.390 
there are a variety of different moves
that<00:00:10.440> you<00:00:10.530> can<00:00:10.679> do<00:00:10.889> to<00:00:12.019> strengthen<00:00:13.400> the

00:00:14.390 --> 00:00:14.400 
that you can do to strengthen the

00:00:14.400 --> 00:00:16.820 
that you can do to strengthen the
muscles<00:00:14.790> engaged<00:00:15.179> in<00:00:15.480> soccer<00:00:15.780> if<00:00:16.080> you<00:00:16.560> notice

00:00:16.820 --> 00:00:16.830 
muscles engaged in soccer if you notice

00:00:16.830 --> 00:00:18.710 
muscles engaged in soccer if you notice
most<00:00:16.980> soccer<00:00:17.279> players<00:00:17.640> have<00:00:17.789> very<00:00:18.359> strong

00:00:18.710 --> 00:00:18.720 
most soccer players have very strong

00:00:18.720 --> 00:00:21.290 
most soccer players have very strong
athletic<00:00:19.320> legs<00:00:19.710> and<00:00:20.070> that's<00:00:20.640> due<00:00:20.850> to<00:00:20.970> the<00:00:21.060> fact

00:00:21.290 --> 00:00:21.300 
athletic legs and that's due to the fact

00:00:21.300 --> 00:00:25.240 
athletic legs and that's due to the fact
that<00:00:21.570> they<00:00:22.410> are<00:00:22.439> in<00:00:22.740> a<00:00:22.800> lot<00:00:22.949> of<00:00:23.070> diverse<00:00:23.430> plains

00:00:25.240 --> 00:00:25.250 
that they are in a lot of diverse plains

00:00:25.250 --> 00:00:28.460 
that they are in a lot of diverse plains
lateral<00:00:26.250> running<00:00:26.550> forward<00:00:27.029> backwards<00:00:27.630> so<00:00:27.930> the

00:00:28.460 --> 00:00:28.470 
lateral running forward backwards so the

00:00:28.470 --> 00:00:30.470 
lateral running forward backwards so the
legs<00:00:28.680> are<00:00:28.859> really<00:00:28.980> fully<00:00:29.490> developed<00:00:30.210> because

00:00:30.470 --> 00:00:30.480 
legs are really fully developed because

00:00:30.480 --> 00:00:33.920 
legs are really fully developed because
of<00:00:30.660> all<00:00:30.869> the<00:00:31.019> range<00:00:31.199> of<00:00:31.349> motion<00:00:31.529> and<00:00:32.809> that<00:00:33.809> they

00:00:33.920 --> 00:00:33.930 
of all the range of motion and that they

00:00:33.930 --> 00:00:36.500 
of all the range of motion and that they
have<00:00:34.140> on<00:00:34.170> the<00:00:34.410> field<00:00:35.059> when<00:00:36.059> you're<00:00:36.210> training

00:00:36.500 --> 00:00:36.510 
have on the field when you're training

00:00:36.510 --> 00:00:38.569 
have on the field when you're training
you<00:00:37.469> want<00:00:37.620> to<00:00:37.710> simulate<00:00:37.890> something<00:00:38.430> a<00:00:38.460> little

00:00:38.569 --> 00:00:38.579 
you want to simulate something a little

00:00:38.579 --> 00:00:39.860 
you want to simulate something a little
more<00:00:38.670> progressive<00:00:39.300> than<00:00:39.480> what<00:00:39.690> they<00:00:39.780> would

00:00:39.860 --> 00:00:39.870 
more progressive than what they would

00:00:39.870 --> 00:00:44.440 
more progressive than what they would
actually<00:00:40.079> do<00:00:40.590> so<00:00:41.190> it's<00:00:41.340> almost<00:00:41.520> a<00:00:41.910> sense<00:00:42.300> of<00:00:42.570> a

00:00:44.440 --> 00:00:44.450 
actually do so it's almost a sense of a

00:00:44.450 --> 00:00:46.850 
actually do so it's almost a sense of a
progressive<00:00:45.450> Progressive<00:00:45.809> training<00:00:46.620> to

00:00:46.850 --> 00:00:46.860 
progressive Progressive training to

00:00:46.860 --> 00:00:48.650 
progressive Progressive training to
where<00:00:47.100> you're<00:00:48.059> working<00:00:48.210> them<00:00:48.450> a<00:00:48.510> little

00:00:48.650 --> 00:00:48.660 
where you're working them a little

00:00:48.660 --> 00:00:50.209 
where you're working them a little
stronger<00:00:49.110> than<00:00:49.200> they<00:00:49.350> would<00:00:49.590> to<00:00:49.920> make<00:00:50.039> them

00:00:50.209 --> 00:00:50.219 
stronger than they would to make them

00:00:50.219 --> 00:00:53.779 
stronger than they would to make them
faster<00:00:50.730> on<00:00:50.940> the<00:00:51.660> field<00:00:51.949> speed<00:00:52.949> is<00:00:53.160> a<00:00:53.190> major

00:00:53.779 --> 00:00:53.789 
faster on the field speed is a major

00:00:53.789 --> 00:00:56.750 
faster on the field speed is a major
importance<00:00:54.360> in<00:00:54.480> soccer<00:00:54.750> a<00:00:55.620> few<00:00:56.520> movements

00:00:56.750 --> 00:00:56.760 
importance in soccer a few movements

00:00:56.760 --> 00:01:00.439 
importance in soccer a few movements
that<00:00:57.059> we<00:00:57.390> like<00:00:57.719> to<00:00:57.899> do<00:00:58.079> or<00:00:59.000> explosive<00:01:00.000> dumbbell

00:01:00.439 --> 00:01:00.449 
that we like to do or explosive dumbbell

00:01:00.449 --> 00:01:04.850 
that we like to do or explosive dumbbell
squats<00:01:02.390> soccer<00:01:03.390> is<00:01:03.539> a<00:01:03.600> fast-paced<00:01:04.019> sports<00:01:04.589> so

00:01:04.850 --> 00:01:04.860 
squats soccer is a fast-paced sports so

00:01:04.860 --> 00:01:08.440 
squats soccer is a fast-paced sports so
you<00:01:04.920> want<00:01:05.159> to<00:01:05.570> mainly<00:01:06.570> focus<00:01:06.600> on<00:01:06.960> fast<00:01:07.290> pace

00:01:08.440 --> 00:01:08.450 
you want to mainly focus on fast pace

00:01:08.450 --> 00:01:11.390 
you want to mainly focus on fast pace
activities<00:01:09.450> promoting<00:01:10.409> more<00:01:10.710> fast<00:01:11.040> twitch

00:01:11.390 --> 00:01:11.400 
activities promoting more fast twitch

00:01:11.400 --> 00:01:15.429 
activities promoting more fast twitch
fiber<00:01:11.790> if<00:01:12.150> you<00:01:12.689> train<00:01:13.049> slow<00:01:13.520> you<00:01:14.520> will<00:01:14.700> be<00:01:14.850> slow

00:01:15.429 --> 00:01:15.439 
fiber if you train slow you will be slow

00:01:15.439 --> 00:01:18.590 
fiber if you train slow you will be slow
so<00:01:16.439> we<00:01:16.560> want<00:01:16.740> to<00:01:16.799> do<00:01:16.920> very<00:01:17.189> dynamic<00:01:17.820> you<00:01:18.479> know

00:01:18.590 --> 00:01:18.600 
so we want to do very dynamic you know

00:01:18.600 --> 00:01:22.370 
so we want to do very dynamic you know

little bit abbreviated we're going to

00:01:38.460 --> 00:01:40.700 
little bit abbreviated we're going to
start<00:01:38.520> with<00:01:38.729> the<00:01:38.820> lateral<00:01:39.360> runs<00:01:39.560> then<00:01:40.560> we'll

00:01:40.700 --> 00:01:40.710 
start with the lateral runs then we'll

00:01:40.710 --> 00:01:44.870 
start with the lateral runs then we'll
go<00:01:40.799> forward<00:01:41.310> and<00:01:41.540> then<00:01:42.540> backwards<00:01:43.110> and<00:01:43.950> we're

00:01:51.770 --> 00:01:51.780 
begin you can see all the resistance

00:01:51.780 --> 00:01:54.410 
begin you can see all the resistance
coming<00:01:52.170> to<00:01:52.320> the<00:01:52.439> left<00:01:52.880> he's<00:01:53.880> really<00:01:54.180> fighting

00:01:54.410 --> 00:01:54.420 
coming to the left he's really fighting

00:01:54.420 --> 00:01:57.709 
coming to the left he's really fighting
and<00:01:55.430> relax<00:01:56.430> it<00:01:56.729> now<00:01:56.939> I'm<00:01:57.329> going<00:01:57.479> to<00:01:57.540> shift

00:01:57.709 --> 00:01:57.719 
and relax it now I'm going to shift

00:01:57.719 --> 00:01:59.270 
and relax it now I'm going to shift

progressive overload on the muscles and

00:02:08.569 --> 00:02:11.930 
progressive overload on the muscles and
relax<00:02:09.569> it<00:02:10.110> and<00:02:10.590> we<00:02:10.679> go<00:02:10.800> lateral<00:02:11.340> again<00:02:11.670> and

00:02:11.930 --> 00:02:11.940 
relax it and we go lateral again and

relax it and we go lateral again and
then<00:02:12.060> we'll<00:02:12.209> go<00:02:12.330> back

00:02:12.750 --> 00:02:12.760 
then we'll go back

00:02:12.760 --> 00:02:15.420 
then we'll go back
