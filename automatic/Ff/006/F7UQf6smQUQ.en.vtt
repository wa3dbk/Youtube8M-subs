00:00:07.260 --> 00:00:09.320
 come on so let's start worrying you 

00:00:09.320 --> 00:00:10.680
 first survey about the nearest plans 

00:00:10.680 --> 00:00:13.680
 what kind of theater can it be 

00:00:14.449 --> 00:00:15.759
 thanks loves 

00:00:15.759 --> 00:00:17.679
 from the nearest evaluation 

00:00:17.679 --> 00:00:19.439
 just such events for me 

00:00:19.439 --> 00:00:20.869
 important organs 

00:00:20.869 --> 00:00:22.400
 and the premiere 

00:00:22.400 --> 00:00:23.390
 performance 

00:00:23.390 --> 00:00:26.060
 in which she took parts to the main role 

00:00:26.060 --> 00:00:28.109
 and so they are a big intrigue and my colleague 

00:00:28.109 --> 00:00:30.119
 now on the theater stage this is igor 

00:00:30.119 --> 00:00:30.919
 yurtaev 

00:00:30.919 --> 00:00:32.960
 known to all for school it will allow 

00:00:32.960 --> 00:00:34.460
 speed up the gate 

00:00:34.460 --> 00:00:36.690
 it's just on every stretch every 

00:00:36.690 --> 00:00:38.240
 rehearsal applied 

00:00:38.240 --> 00:00:40.760
 we have such a novelty process because it 

00:00:40.760 --> 00:00:42.780
 but the federation was on the scene 

00:00:42.780 --> 00:00:46.080
 he complained to the children it will be still that year 

00:00:46.080 --> 00:00:47.560
 so all over again 

00:00:47.560 --> 00:00:50.240
 he starts to fail binds walk and 

00:00:50.240 --> 00:00:52.050
 acting is something that a completely different movie 

00:00:52.050 --> 00:00:53.360
 and theater and cinema 

00:00:53.360 --> 00:00:54.350
 not gasoline yes 

00:00:54.350 --> 00:00:56.600
 and that you are more than six points attract here 

00:00:56.600 --> 00:00:57.630
 but or theater 

00:00:57.630 --> 00:00:59.520
 because in Russia, as it were, that 

00:00:59.520 --> 00:01:01.660
 the actor has either theatrical or 

00:01:01.660 --> 00:01:02.670
 film actor 

00:01:02.670 --> 00:01:03.499
 in the end 

00:01:03.499 --> 00:01:05.269
 you have seven more in america that you 

00:01:05.269 --> 00:01:05.810
 more 

00:01:05.810 --> 00:01:07.730
 not always very afraid more than 

00:01:07.730 --> 00:01:10.160
 right now the theater is so addictive 

00:01:10.160 --> 00:01:12.350
 that i'm afraid not so delayed yes right 

00:01:12.350 --> 00:01:13.350
 debt 

00:01:13.350 --> 00:01:14.480
 I think so 

00:01:14.480 --> 00:01:16.530
 hopes that this first 3 is recognized 

00:01:16.530 --> 00:01:18.400
 project nabucco probably all 

00:01:18.400 --> 00:01:20.650
 offers 

00:01:20.650 --> 00:01:21.720
 oao 

00:01:21.720 --> 00:01:23.740
 desire to become an actress all the same ul 

00:01:23.740 --> 00:01:25.790
 first wish or did it just come with 

00:01:25.790 --> 00:01:27.660
 by age it may be 

00:01:27.660 --> 00:01:29.890
 I had to Lenin 

00:01:29.890 --> 00:01:31.590
 actually wanted the army 

00:01:31.590 --> 00:01:33.110
 how to be a director 

00:01:33.110 --> 00:01:34.780
 and came under the introductory peak 

00:01:34.780 --> 00:01:36.800
 exams see all 

00:01:36.800 --> 00:01:38.680
 so at the court of the Strizhenov center 

00:01:38.680 --> 00:01:40.700
 What is the list of teachers is an exam 

00:01:40.700 --> 00:01:42.780
 sanctify the tour that can be read 

00:01:42.780 --> 00:01:44.930
 the ball got scared about 1 

00:01:44.930 --> 00:01:46.990
 so I thought so if you have to run like 

00:01:46.990 --> 00:01:48.880
 get it is time to move the players 

00:01:48.880 --> 00:01:50.600
 market picnic going 

00:01:50.600 --> 00:01:52.040
 insanely huge 

00:01:52.040 --> 00:01:53.580
 list of references you need 

00:01:53.580 --> 00:01:55.030
 read 

00:01:55.030 --> 00:01:57.000
 unfortunately i don't like to read not 

00:01:57.000 --> 00:01:58.040
 loved 

00:01:58.040 --> 00:02:00.430
 in that the third was published young 

00:02:00.430 --> 00:02:01.850
 and I decided to go to the acting department 

00:02:01.850 --> 00:02:04.000
 asking for such notes and there are eight 

00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:05.800
 positions of creation by itself therefore i 

00:02:05.800 --> 00:02:07.960
 decided so and acting so 

00:02:07.960 --> 00:02:09.710
 easy way I thought that under arrest 

00:02:09.710 --> 00:02:11.439
 actresses and then 

00:02:11.439 --> 00:02:14.400
 but later, since there 35 and 40 and I already 

00:02:14.400 --> 00:02:15.859
 became director 

00:02:15.859 --> 00:02:17.829
 but then maybe all kakut 

00:02:17.829 --> 00:02:20.829
 vivid history of social networks 

00:02:21.659 --> 00:02:25.019
 on the arkan itself, we would have won for the victory of Gerasimov 

00:02:25.019 --> 00:02:27.319
 honestly admit maggie court permission 

00:02:27.319 --> 00:02:30.739
 left she forgot 4 classmate 

00:02:30.739 --> 00:02:32.480
 two boys two girls parents 

00:02:32.480 --> 00:02:33.739
 of protection 

00:02:33.739 --> 00:02:34.719
 Finnish newspaper 

00:02:34.719 --> 00:02:37.470
 at the start of the five rafiev how we are tired 

00:02:37.470 --> 00:02:39.560

00:02:39.560 --> 00:02:41.829
 summoned friends rasim 

00:02:41.829 --> 00:02:44.009
 reluctantly communication with the portal 

00:02:44.009 --> 00:02:46.089

00:02:46.089 --> 00:02:48.649
 inspection and I went through Gediminas heard 

00:02:48.649 --> 00:02:49.920
 step towards ax 

00:02:49.920 --> 00:02:51.800
 but try to bondage silence emotions 

00:02:51.800 --> 00:02:54.680
 Gerasimov came to us statistics 

00:02:54.680 --> 00:02:56.959
 in the middle of a sudden such a swotting Eric 

00:02:56.959 --> 00:02:59.030
 then of course we were afraid for what 

00:02:59.030 --> 00:03:01.319
 he is suddenly scared uv 

00:03:01.319 --> 00:03:03.870
 expect the personal debts of the churches I am so very 

00:03:03.870 --> 00:03:05.479
 bright to reduce reading 

00:03:05.479 --> 00:03:07.459
 we are good because such a question about with whom 

00:03:07.459 --> 00:03:08.689
 I would like to work maybe 

00:03:08.689 --> 00:03:11.599
 foreign actor director 

00:03:11.599 --> 00:03:13.459
 but foreign is still the same 

00:03:13.459 --> 00:03:16.329
 as the brothers were driven out of those 

00:03:16.329 --> 00:03:18.279
 from our newspaper bild 

00:03:18.279 --> 00:03:20.149

00:03:20.149 --> 00:03:23.619
 what is Nina Usatov 

00:03:23.619 --> 00:03:26.489
 Vladimir Menshov but we already worked with him 

00:03:26.489 --> 00:03:27.739
 this lucky man 

00:03:27.739 --> 00:03:30.599
 prices still had a picture 

00:03:30.599 --> 00:03:32.589
 it is better to consider salts 

00:03:32.589 --> 00:03:34.229
 themselves such rubies rub 

00:03:34.229 --> 00:03:35.250
 one of the young 

00:03:35.250 --> 00:03:37.010

00:03:39.060 --> 00:03:42.060
 also no shot them bottle directors 

00:03:43.099 --> 00:03:44.539

00:03:47.049 --> 00:03:49.259
 life happens like you bring aveo 

00:03:49.259 --> 00:03:51.779
 so appropriate to allow 

00:03:51.779 --> 00:03:53.689
 This happy and so had to no 

00:03:53.689 --> 00:03:56.689
 every time on these examples 

00:03:57.649 --> 00:03:59.789
 data of course smile 

00:03:59.789 --> 00:04:01.949
 this exhibition is retro train support 

00:04:01.949 --> 00:04:03.249
 close because there is no sad 

00:04:03.249 --> 00:04:05.449
 sometimes sometimes not everything works 

00:04:05.449 --> 00:04:07.749
 it is their plot all fast like this 

00:04:07.749 --> 00:04:10.609
 I want to help the ball to close or such 

00:04:10.609 --> 00:04:13.439
 The main film event and I was born a 

00:04:13.439 --> 00:04:14.899
 the month of August at the dump 

00:04:14.899 --> 00:04:15.809

 Lenny kravitsa cisco you 

00:04:19.809 --> 00:04:21.799
 And two three such segment five-year 

00:04:21.799 --> 00:04:23.919
 joint many even then we and they 

00:04:23.919 --> 00:04:25.719
 felt like being kids me like that very 

00:04:25.719 --> 00:04:28.849
 sedans were surrounded by the idea of ​​taking his girlfriends 

00:04:28.849 --> 00:04:31.080
 they had a square where they gave birth to children 

00:04:31.080 --> 00:04:31.949
 they are like a body hour 

00:04:31.949 --> 00:04:33.610
 everyone suffers everyone 

00:04:33.610 --> 00:04:35.400
 revealed that this period has decreased 

00:04:35.400 --> 00:04:37.330
 stronger opponent when on support 

00:04:37.330 --> 00:04:38.029
 what 

00:04:38.029 --> 00:04:40.990
 it's better here 

00:04:40.990 --> 00:04:42.990
 and true the final question is what do you have 

00:04:42.990 --> 00:04:44.960
 wait this year also cattle projects 

00:04:44.960 --> 00:04:45.970
 can be theatrical what 

00:04:45.970 --> 00:04:48.159
 serials customs 

00:04:48.159 --> 00:04:50.409
 but how do we have such a stringers accident 

00:04:50.409 --> 00:04:53.249
 statistics then wrong acting troupe to 

00:04:53.249 --> 00:04:55.819
 vodka will not sign the contract we are not about 

00:04:55.819 --> 00:04:58.379
 we say those who supply something is not yours 

00:04:58.379 --> 00:05:00.080
 that is, it can be removed tarantino 

00:05:00.080 --> 00:05:01.770
 got releases maybe anna there 

00:05:01.770 --> 00:05:03.580

00:05:03.580 --> 00:05:04.880
 Anna Karenina really looking forward 

00:05:04.880 --> 00:05:07.740
 Yes, I definitely saw the coach 3 

00:05:07.740 --> 00:05:09.520
 I would be interested to see 

00:05:09.520 --> 00:05:11.159
 and maybe at the same time Russian 

00:05:11.159 --> 00:05:13.899
 here go to the vodka workers 

00:05:13.899 --> 00:05:15.490
 packed there st 

00:05:15.490 --> 00:05:18.490
 gentlemen of Fortune 

00:05:19.020 --> 00:05:20.719
 probably know to my shame 

00:05:20.719 --> 00:05:22.499
 I will now say that foreign coaches 

00:05:22.499 --> 00:05:24.800
 I am waiting for a very valuable hand 

00:05:24.800 --> 00:05:27.539
 how many years do I think that this is me all publications 

00:05:27.539 --> 00:05:29.810
 franciscan november and lo i 

00:05:29.810 --> 00:05:32.330
 I'll go there and probably 

00:05:32.330 --> 00:05:34.319
 minfin is such a big company 

00:05:34.319 --> 00:05:36.620
 basically it will concern the company 

00:05:36.620 --> 00:05:38.719
 but could bow trophim 

00:05:38.719 --> 00:05:40.929
 despite how we would have such growth 

00:05:40.929 --> 00:05:41.749
 would be age 

00:05:41.749 --> 00:05:43.509
 but I really like this story 

00:05:43.509 --> 00:05:45.939
 tough Lennikov looked after 

00:05:45.939 --> 00:05:48.289
 I periodically from the last part 

00:05:48.289 --> 00:05:50.289
 After all, Russian to be honest, I would 

00:05:50.289 --> 00:05:51.939
 they have not prepared today's interview 

00:05:51.939 --> 00:05:54.779
 and did not see what goes in the rental 

00:05:54.779 --> 00:05:56.429
 and this is the way the exchange is here about Poland 

00:05:56.429 --> 00:05:58.479
 a few minutes in the cinema 

00:05:58.479 --> 00:06:00.549
 the coach will be advertising and I will not give up 

00:06:00.549 --> 00:06:02.800
 getting acquainted with pictures 

00:06:02.800 --> 00:06:03.770
 thank you very much for the intrigue
