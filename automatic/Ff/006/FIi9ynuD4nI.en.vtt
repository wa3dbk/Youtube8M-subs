00:00:18.870 --> 00:00:23.370
 hello to all the students of the pedro 

00:00:21.120 --> 00:00:25.410
 ruiz gallo now trying the last 

00:00:23.370 --> 00:00:27.510
 public contest that is a scam 

00:00:25.410 --> 00:00:29.550
 orchestrated by the rector collantes and 

00:00:27.510 --> 00:00:32.070
 that agustín ramos is just a puppet of 

00:00:29.550 --> 00:00:34.170
 collantes let's start all this process has 

00:00:32.070 --> 00:00:36.360
 been totally planned by the rector 

00:00:34.170 --> 00:00:38.130
 jaime collante santisteban at first 

00:00:36.360 --> 00:00:40.040
 view you have what it is about 

00:00:38.130 --> 00:00:42.450
 gather new people for your government 

00:00:40.040 --> 00:00:44.640
 this is how the process is illegal 

00:00:42.450 --> 00:00:46.430
 from every point of the contest 

00:00:44.640 --> 00:00:48.720
 to the squares of some faculties 

00:00:46.430 --> 00:00:50.910
 those in which there is no advice from 

00:00:48.720 --> 00:00:53.430
 faculty and of those that do have it 

00:00:50.910 --> 00:00:55.680
 leave aside what is the very simple reason 

00:00:53.430 --> 00:00:57.960
 where there is faculty council the 

00:00:55.680 --> 00:00:59.760
 interference of the whole process would be to 

00:00:57.960 --> 00:01:01.800
 charge directly from the commission 

00:00:59.760 --> 00:01:04.379
 central contest ie the 

00:01:01.800 --> 00:01:06.780
 Academic vice chancellor and other incident 

00:01:04.379 --> 00:01:08.970
 it's about collantes the owner of the circus 

00:01:06.780 --> 00:01:11.880
 of the puppets that I would then place as 

00:01:08.970 --> 00:01:13.770
 juries of merits and opposition then in 

00:01:11.880 --> 00:01:15.960
 the bases of the contest were lowered the 

00:01:13.770 --> 00:01:18.210
 scores only as an example for 

00:01:15.960 --> 00:01:22.140
 auxiliaries lowered it from 20 to 13 points 

00:01:18.210 --> 00:01:24.240
 in merit and from 75 to 25 in opposition to 

00:01:22.140 --> 00:01:25.290
 regarding the last contract contest 

00:01:24.240 --> 00:01:27.660
 who called the 

00:01:25.290 --> 00:01:29.940
 previous to himself in his eagerness to 

00:01:27.660 --> 00:01:32.640
 favoring your allies the juries 

00:01:29.940 --> 00:01:34.830
 they were strategically chosen so much 

00:01:32.640 --> 00:01:37.080
 in merits as opposed to 

00:01:34.830 --> 00:01:39.480
 established a single jury for all 

00:01:37.080 --> 00:01:41.670
 squares or rotating with each other in some 

00:01:39.480 --> 00:01:44.580
 Faculty case schools of mechanics 

00:01:41.670 --> 00:01:46.620
 faculty of mathematics and others this with 

00:01:44.580 --> 00:01:48.630
 in order to consider only his people and 

00:01:46.620 --> 00:01:51.420
 guarantee an aid to their new 

00:01:48.630 --> 00:01:53.610
 called up starting with the results 

00:01:51.420 --> 00:01:56.190
 merits phase were published in 

00:01:53.610 --> 00:01:58.020
 the web on Saturday, February 23 at 5 

00:01:56.190 --> 00:02:00.119
 in the afternoon but only the ability to 

00:01:58.020 --> 00:02:03.330
 the candidates but not the scores 

00:02:00.119 --> 00:02:05.910
 what were the reasons first to be 

00:02:03.330 --> 00:02:07.800
 too late and weekend is no longer 

00:02:05.910 --> 00:02:09.479
 I would have time to inquire and obtain 

00:02:07.800 --> 00:02:11.400
 information to challenge such 

00:02:09.479 --> 00:02:14.100
 results since the date of 

00:02:11.400 --> 00:02:16.170
 Challenge was Monday, February 25 

00:02:14.100 --> 00:02:18.360
 until 1 in the afternoon at the same time that it is 

00:02:16.170 --> 00:02:21.390
 On the same day, the draw for 

00:02:18.360 --> 00:02:23.010
 public class second the results of 

00:02:21.390 --> 00:02:25.200
 the merit evaluation were 

00:02:23.010 --> 00:02:27.180
 saved under seven keys to be able 

00:02:25.200 --> 00:02:29.220
 then square those with the results of 

00:02:27.180 --> 00:02:31.500
 the public class and make the arrangements 

00:02:29.220 --> 00:02:33.450
 needed for your favored now 

00:02:31.500 --> 00:02:35.190
 the supposed draw of topics for the 

00:02:33.450 --> 00:02:37.020
 public class was carried in a manner 

00:02:35.190 --> 00:02:39.240
 individual behind closed doors every 

00:02:37.020 --> 00:02:41.550
 applicant with his jury is to say the 

00:02:39.240 --> 00:02:43.500
 godchildren with their sponsors decide what 

00:02:41.550 --> 00:02:45.120
 topic they would like to address there was no 

00:02:43.500 --> 00:02:48.120
 publication of any of the topics 

00:02:45.120 --> 00:02:50.670
 drawn during the exhibitions of the 

00:02:48.120 --> 00:02:52.950
 same way only the 

00:02:50.670 --> 00:02:55.260
 jury is to say the sponsors and the 

00:02:52.950 --> 00:02:57.330
 applicant or the godson is not 

00:02:55.260 --> 00:02:58.470
 allowed the entry of other applicants 

00:02:57.330 --> 00:03:01.350
 or general public 

00:02:58.470 --> 00:03:03.510
 also some classes were given up 

00:03:01.350 --> 00:03:05.370
 very late at night where there was no 

00:03:03.510 --> 00:03:07.500
 way to corroborate even if it 

00:03:05.370 --> 00:03:09.720
 they gave or not the results 

00:03:07.500 --> 00:03:12.420
 were filled out in the forms 

00:03:09.720 --> 00:03:15.300
 evaluation with pencil yes sir with pencil 

00:03:12.420 --> 00:03:16.950
 because it will be simple to later fix and 

00:03:15.300 --> 00:03:20.070
 square the numbers in favor of their 

00:03:16.950 --> 00:03:22.170
 finally preferred the results of 

00:03:20.070 --> 00:03:24.570
 such process were published very 

00:03:22.170 --> 00:03:27.330
 night nine of the night exactly the 

00:03:24.570 --> 00:03:29.730
 first of March well well they have 

00:03:27.330 --> 00:03:31.680
 judge what is the transparency 

00:03:29.730 --> 00:03:34.230
 and impartiality preached about this 

00:03:31.680 --> 00:03:36.290
 process, it is only enough to see the table 

00:03:34.230 --> 00:03:39.079
 results and observe that the 

00:03:36.290 --> 00:03:41.780
 and clear winners are mostly 

00:03:39.079 --> 00:03:44.120
 postulating alone in their places instead 

00:03:41.780 --> 00:03:46.549
 those who were not of his political line is 

00:03:44.120 --> 00:03:48.980
 say the stones of your shoes who 

00:03:46.549 --> 00:03:52.099
 do not pay homage to collantes were 

00:03:48.980 --> 00:03:54.150
 punished with 234 to six 

00:03:52.099 --> 00:03:56.620
 opponents 

00:03:54.150 --> 00:03:59.470
 coincidence those who earn the places 

00:03:56.620 --> 00:04:01.330
 the chosen ones lose in merits because 

00:03:59.470 --> 00:04:04.180
 you could not do much win in 

00:04:01.330 --> 00:04:06.099
 opposition is to say in the public class to 

00:04:04.180 --> 00:04:08.200
 closed door with a difference 

00:04:06.099 --> 00:04:10.420
 scandalous of up to more than 20 points 

00:04:08.200 --> 00:04:13.090
 It is the only thing that could be done to 

00:04:10.420 --> 00:04:15.010
 achieve your goals but there is no 

00:04:13.090 --> 00:04:17.709
 all jaime collantes charge for each 

00:04:15.010 --> 00:04:19.359
 teacher more than 10 thousand soles adding up 

00:04:17.709 --> 00:04:21.459
 the one hundred and three squares is all the 

00:04:19.359 --> 00:04:23.229
 amount of one hundred and thirty thousand new 

00:04:21.459 --> 00:04:25.750
 So yes yes they heard of a hundred and 

00:04:23.229 --> 00:04:28.810
 thirty thousand nuevos soles is good for 

00:04:25.750 --> 00:04:30.400
 start well the year 2013 so we invoke 

00:04:28.810 --> 00:04:33.190
 the pool of tax ministry 

00:04:30.400 --> 00:04:34.810
 public to the judiciary and authorities 

00:04:33.190 --> 00:04:38.470
 competent to investigate deeply 

00:04:34.810 --> 00:04:40.360
 this mafia and not part of it in 

00:04:38.470 --> 00:04:42.729
 general public conclusion 

00:04:40.360 --> 00:04:45.010
 companions of the pedro ruiz gallo these 

00:04:42.729 --> 00:04:47.110
 are our authorities we have new 

00:04:45.010 --> 00:04:50.590
 mediocre qualification teachers and 

00:04:47.110 --> 00:04:53.169
 coimeros compañeros we are anonymous 

00:04:50.590 --> 00:04:56.070
