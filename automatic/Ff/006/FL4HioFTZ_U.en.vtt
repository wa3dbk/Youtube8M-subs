common snap traps for trapping rats I'm
going<00:00:06.150> to<00:00:06.210> go<00:00:06.330> through<00:00:06.660> the<00:00:06.899> process<00:00:07.440> of

00:00:07.550 --> 00:00:07.560 
going to go through the process of

00:00:07.560 --> 00:00:09.770 
going to go through the process of
setting<00:00:07.919> each<00:00:08.069> one<00:00:08.099> of<00:00:08.460> these<00:00:08.550> and<00:00:08.880> show<00:00:09.719> you

00:00:09.770 --> 00:00:09.780 
setting each one of these and show you

00:00:09.780 --> 00:00:16.190 
setting each one of these and show you
the<00:00:09.960> differences

00:00:16.190 --> 00:00:16.200 

00:00:16.200 --> 00:00:19.980 

first<00:00:17.200> is<00:00:17.440> a<00:00:17.470> standard<00:00:17.670> old-time<00:00:18.990> Victor

00:00:19.980 --> 00:00:19.990 
first is a standard old-time Victor

00:00:19.990 --> 00:00:23.280 
first is a standard old-time Victor
Rattrap<00:00:21.570> essentially<00:00:22.570> pulled<00:00:22.900> back<00:00:23.110> the

00:00:23.280 --> 00:00:23.290 
Rattrap essentially pulled back the

00:00:23.290 --> 00:00:27.780 
Rattrap essentially pulled back the
springs<00:00:25.170> take<00:00:26.170> this<00:00:26.380> lever<00:00:26.680> over<00:00:26.980> the<00:00:27.189> top<00:00:27.430> and

00:00:27.780 --> 00:00:27.790 
springs take this lever over the top and

00:00:27.790 --> 00:00:29.730 
springs take this lever over the top and
it's<00:00:28.660> going<00:00:28.720> to<00:00:28.869> fit<00:00:29.050> in<00:00:29.170> this<00:00:29.290> little<00:00:29.349> groove

00:00:29.730 --> 00:00:29.740 
it's going to fit in this little groove

00:00:29.740 --> 00:00:34.440 
it's going to fit in this little groove
right<00:00:29.770> here<00:00:30.189> and<00:00:30.550> now<00:00:30.880> that<00:00:30.910> set<00:00:32.970> the<00:00:33.970> second

00:00:34.440 --> 00:00:34.450 
right here and now that set the second

00:00:34.450 --> 00:00:37.979 
right here and now that set the second
is<00:00:34.680> the<00:00:35.680> victor<00:00:36.040> professional<00:00:36.670> trap<00:00:36.910> as<00:00:37.840> you

00:00:37.979 --> 00:00:37.989 
is the victor professional trap as you

00:00:37.989 --> 00:00:41.000 
is the victor professional trap as you
can<00:00:38.110> see<00:00:38.260> it<00:00:38.350> has<00:00:38.470> an<00:00:38.649> expanded<00:00:39.220> trigger<00:00:39.760> and

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:41.010 
can see it has an expanded trigger and

00:00:41.010 --> 00:00:46.939 
can see it has an expanded trigger and
you<00:00:42.010> pull<00:00:42.550> back<00:00:42.820> a<00:00:44.070> spring-loaded<00:00:45.070> bar<00:00:45.760> and

00:00:46.939 --> 00:00:46.949 
you pull back a spring-loaded bar and

00:00:46.949 --> 00:00:50.009 
you pull back a spring-loaded bar and
this<00:00:47.949> time<00:00:48.250> there's<00:00:49.149> a<00:00:49.239> little<00:00:49.480> groove<00:00:49.719> in<00:00:49.929> the

00:00:50.009 --> 00:00:50.019 
this time there's a little groove in the

00:00:50.019 --> 00:00:52.380 
this time there's a little groove in the
back<00:00:50.289> of<00:00:50.500> this<00:00:50.620> pad<00:00:50.890> and<00:00:51.160> that's<00:00:51.850> going<00:00:52.090> to<00:00:52.149> fit

00:00:52.380 --> 00:00:52.390 
back of this pad and that's going to fit

00:00:52.390 --> 00:00:57.060 
back of this pad and that's going to fit
in<00:00:52.510> there<00:00:53.399> now<00:00:54.399> that<00:00:54.609> once<00:00:54.850> said<00:00:55.800> make<00:00:56.800> sure<00:00:56.920> at

00:01:06.150 --> 00:01:06.160 
got a high risk of actually setting that

these it's a little bit more you got to

00:01:36.759 --> 00:01:38.910 
these it's a little bit more you got to
make<00:01:36.880> sure<00:01:37.000> you<00:01:37.119> have<00:01:37.270> that<00:01:37.360> depressed<00:01:37.920> and

00:01:38.910 --> 00:01:38.920 
make sure you have that depressed and

00:01:38.920 --> 00:01:40.440 
make sure you have that depressed and
then<00:01:39.040> slowly<00:01:39.340> ride<00:01:39.700> that<00:01:39.909> bar<00:01:40.090> all<00:01:40.240> the<00:01:40.270> way<00:01:40.360> to

00:01:40.440 --> 00:01:40.450 
then slowly ride that bar all the way to

00:01:40.450 --> 00:01:43.800 
then slowly ride that bar all the way to
the<00:01:40.600> front<00:01:40.840> and<00:01:42.210> same<00:01:43.210> with<00:01:43.390> this<00:01:43.540> one

00:01:43.800 --> 00:01:43.810 
the front and same with this one

00:01:43.810 --> 00:01:46.499 
the front and same with this one
push<00:01:44.140> it<00:01:44.289> down<00:01:44.789> move<00:01:45.789> the<00:01:45.820> bar<00:01:46.090> out<00:01:46.240> of<00:01:46.329> the<00:01:46.390> way

00:01:46.499 --> 00:01:46.509 
push it down move the bar out of the way

00:01:46.509 --> 00:01:53.010 
push it down move the bar out of the way
and<00:01:46.780> slowly<00:01:47.079> release<00:01:47.500> it

00:01:53.010 --> 00:01:53.020 

00:01:53.020 --> 00:01:56.279 

I<00:01:54.149> recommend<00:01:55.149> putting<00:01:55.479> the<00:01:55.689> bait<00:01:55.899> in<00:01:56.079> all

00:01:56.279 --> 00:01:56.289 
I recommend putting the bait in all

00:01:56.289 --> 00:02:00.959 
I recommend putting the bait in all
these<00:01:56.820> prior<00:01:58.320> to<00:01:59.320> setting<00:01:59.649> them<00:01:59.799> so<00:02:00.700> the<00:02:00.820> bait

00:02:00.959 --> 00:02:00.969 
these prior to setting them so the bait

00:02:00.969 --> 00:02:03.090 
these prior to setting them so the bait
would<00:02:01.119> be<00:02:01.240> attached<00:02:01.539> here<00:02:01.719> it<00:02:02.619> would<00:02:02.770> fit<00:02:02.950> in

00:02:03.090 --> 00:02:03.100 
would be attached here it would fit in

00:02:03.100 --> 00:02:05.340 
would be attached here it would fit in
to<00:02:03.759> this<00:02:03.880> little<00:02:03.939> reservoir<00:02:04.509> here<00:02:05.140> or

00:02:05.340 --> 00:02:05.350 
to this little reservoir here or

00:02:05.350 --> 00:02:07.410 
to this little reservoir here or
underneath<00:02:05.770> this<00:02:06.009> little<00:02:06.159> V<00:02:06.429> you<00:02:07.119> want<00:02:07.299> the

00:02:07.410 --> 00:02:07.420 
underneath this little V you want the

00:02:07.420 --> 00:02:08.850 
underneath this little V you want the
bait<00:02:07.630> is<00:02:07.840> far<00:02:08.080> back<00:02:08.289> on<00:02:08.500> this<00:02:08.649> particular

00:02:08.850 --> 00:02:08.860 
bait is far back on this particular

00:02:08.860 --> 00:02:11.130 
bait is far back on this particular
model<00:02:09.220> as<00:02:09.429> possible<00:02:09.970> so<00:02:10.690> that<00:02:10.720> there's<00:02:11.019> no

00:02:11.130 --> 00:02:11.140 
model as possible so that there's no

00:02:11.140 --> 00:02:12.420 
model as possible so that there's no
pressure<00:02:11.379> on<00:02:11.560> the<00:02:11.680> trigger

00:02:12.420 --> 00:02:12.430 
pressure on the trigger

00:02:12.430 --> 00:02:15.559 
pressure on the trigger
this<00:02:13.000> one's<00:02:13.269> got<00:02:13.480> a<00:02:13.540> reservoir<00:02:14.019> built<00:02:14.410> in<00:02:15.040> as

00:02:15.559 --> 00:02:15.569 
this one's got a reservoir built in as

00:02:15.569 --> 00:02:19.020 
this one's got a reservoir built in as
well<00:02:16.569> as<00:02:16.989> this<00:02:17.260> one<00:02:17.500> as<00:02:18.160> you<00:02:18.340> can<00:02:18.459> see<00:02:18.610> it<00:02:18.670> very

00:02:19.020 --> 00:02:19.030 
well as this one as you can see it very

00:02:19.030 --> 00:02:24.089 
well as this one as you can see it very
similar<00:02:19.480> in<00:02:20.010> design<00:02:21.660> and<00:02:22.660> that's<00:02:23.200> how<00:02:23.769> to<00:02:23.830> set

00:02:24.089 --> 00:02:24.099 
similar in design and that's how to set

00:02:24.099 --> 00:02:26.670 
similar in design and that's how to set
of<00:02:24.190> a<00:02:24.250> rat<00:02:24.400> trap
