00:00:01.230 --> 00:00:03.450 

hello<00:00:02.230> everybody<00:00:02.560> my<00:00:02.740> name<00:00:02.770> is<00:00:02.920> Erin<00:00:03.279> and<00:00:03.370> I'm

00:00:03.450 --> 00:00:03.460 
hello everybody my name is Erin and I'm

00:00:03.460 --> 00:00:07.559 
hello everybody my name is Erin and I'm
going<00:00:03.759> to<00:00:03.909> debunk<00:00:04.330> the<00:00:04.919> magnet<00:00:05.919> fan<00:00:06.569> special

00:00:07.559 --> 00:00:07.569 
going to debunk the magnet fan special

00:00:07.569 --> 00:00:12.480 
going to debunk the magnet fan special
motion<00:00:09.240> experiment<00:00:10.240> here<00:00:11.040> you<00:00:12.040> might<00:00:12.220> hear

00:00:12.480 --> 00:00:12.490 
motion experiment here you might hear

00:00:12.490 --> 00:00:14.310 
motion experiment here you might hear
that<00:00:12.700> 3d<00:00:13.030> printer<00:00:13.390> in<00:00:13.450> the<00:00:13.540> background<00:00:13.990> chime

00:00:14.310 --> 00:00:14.320 
that 3d printer in the background chime

00:00:14.320 --> 00:00:17.370 
that 3d printer in the background chime
in<00:00:14.470> a<00:00:14.530> way<00:00:14.650> anyways<00:00:15.340> I<00:00:15.610> put<00:00:16.539> magnets<00:00:16.779> on<00:00:17.170> this

00:00:17.370 --> 00:00:17.380 
in a way anyways I put magnets on this

00:00:17.380 --> 00:00:22.020 
in a way anyways I put magnets on this
fan<00:00:17.650> and<00:00:18.450> a<00:00:19.450> subtraction<00:00:20.200> side<00:00:20.890> that's<00:00:21.700> the

00:00:22.020 --> 00:00:22.030 
fan and a subtraction side that's the

00:00:22.030 --> 00:00:26.730 
fan and a subtraction side that's the
repelling<00:00:22.630> side<00:00:22.930> so<00:00:23.830> if<00:00:24.340> I<00:00:24.610> hold<00:00:24.850> it<00:00:25.740> right

00:00:26.730 --> 00:00:26.740 
repelling side so if I hold it right

00:00:26.740 --> 00:00:33.209 
repelling side so if I hold it right
here<00:00:29.910> you<00:00:30.910> get<00:00:31.060> some<00:00:31.360> some<00:00:32.050> repelling<00:00:32.710> there

00:00:33.209 --> 00:00:33.219 
here you get some some repelling there

00:00:33.219 --> 00:00:36.959 
here you get some some repelling there
it<00:00:33.429> is<00:00:33.719> but<00:00:34.739> because<00:00:35.739> the<00:00:36.010> magnetic<00:00:36.460> field<00:00:36.760> is

00:00:36.959 --> 00:00:36.969 
it is but because the magnetic field is

00:00:36.969 --> 00:00:38.549 
it is but because the magnetic field is
a<00:00:36.999> big<00:00:37.210> circle<00:00:37.629> around<00:00:37.719> the<00:00:38.050> end<00:00:38.199> of<00:00:38.350> this

00:00:38.549 --> 00:00:38.559 
a big circle around the end of this

00:00:38.559 --> 00:00:42.119 
a big circle around the end of this
magnet<00:00:39.069> it<00:00:40.030> not<00:00:40.749> only<00:00:40.839> repels<00:00:41.409> this<00:00:41.739> magnet

00:00:42.119 --> 00:00:42.129 
magnet it not only repels this magnet

00:00:42.129 --> 00:00:45.270 
magnet it not only repels this magnet
away<00:00:42.249> it<00:00:42.699> also<00:00:42.850> repels<00:00:43.390> that<00:00:44.019> magnet<00:00:44.499> away<00:00:44.739> so

00:00:45.270 --> 00:00:45.280 
away it also repels that magnet away so

00:00:45.280 --> 00:00:47.099 
away it also repels that magnet away so
you<00:00:45.699> actually<00:00:46.030> don't<00:00:46.239> go<00:00:46.479> anywhere<00:00:46.899> with<00:00:47.079> it

00:00:47.099 --> 00:00:47.109 
you actually don't go anywhere with it

00:00:47.109 --> 00:00:49.200 
you actually don't go anywhere with it
via<00:00:47.710> the<00:00:47.889> magnet<00:00:48.309> I<00:00:48.429> mean<00:00:48.579> this<00:00:48.699> thing<00:00:48.999> it

00:00:49.200 --> 00:00:49.210 
via the magnet I mean this thing it

00:00:49.210 --> 00:00:50.910 
via the magnet I mean this thing it
spins<00:00:49.539> backwards<00:00:50.079> better<00:00:50.319> than<00:00:50.530> it<00:00:50.649> spins

00:00:50.910 --> 00:00:50.920 
spins backwards better than it spins

00:00:50.920 --> 00:00:55.770 
spins backwards better than it spins
forwards<00:00:52.649> but<00:00:53.649> I<00:00:54.010> mean<00:00:54.879> I<00:00:55.030> might<00:00:55.449> be<00:00:55.479> able<00:00:55.719> to

00:00:55.770 --> 00:00:55.780 
forwards but I mean I might be able to

00:00:55.780 --> 00:00:58.349 
forwards but I mean I might be able to
get<00:00:55.929> it<00:00:56.019> going<00:00:56.170> here<00:00:56.409> just<00:00:56.679> one<00:00:56.859> second<00:00:57.219> I<00:00:57.519> mean

00:00:58.349 --> 00:00:58.359 
get it going here just one second I mean

00:00:58.359 --> 00:01:00.899 
get it going here just one second I mean
it<00:00:58.479> feels<00:00:58.780> like<00:00:58.989> it<00:00:59.289> might<00:00:59.319> work<00:00:59.859> and<00:01:00.219> then<00:01:00.789> it

00:01:00.899 --> 00:01:00.909 
it feels like it might work and then it

00:01:00.909 --> 00:01:02.819 
it feels like it might work and then it
doesn't<00:01:01.239> so<00:01:01.359> good<00:01:01.539> a<00:01:01.569> way<00:01:02.229> to<00:01:02.289> test<00:01:02.620> it<00:01:02.739> would

00:01:02.819 --> 00:01:02.829 
doesn't so good a way to test it would

00:01:02.829 --> 00:01:08.249 
doesn't so good a way to test it would
be<00:01:02.979> to<00:01:03.100> spin<00:01:03.429> this<00:01:05.610> and<00:01:06.610> I'm<00:01:06.820> on<00:01:07.030> the<00:01:07.149> ED<00:01:07.270> whoops

00:01:08.249 --> 00:01:08.259 
be to spin this and I'm on the ED whoops

00:01:08.259 --> 00:01:09.779 
be to spin this and I'm on the ED whoops
I'm<00:01:08.409> attracted<00:01:08.829> to<00:01:08.860> the<00:01:09.070> magnet<00:01:09.430> inside<00:01:09.729> of

00:01:09.779 --> 00:01:09.789 
I'm attracted to the magnet inside of

00:01:09.789 --> 00:01:13.920 
I'm attracted to the magnet inside of
the<00:01:09.850> motor<00:01:10.030> and<00:01:10.299> I'm<00:01:10.990> on<00:01:11.229> the<00:01:12.689> repelling<00:01:13.689> side

00:01:13.920 --> 00:01:13.930 
the motor and I'm on the repelling side

00:01:13.930 --> 00:01:15.840 
the motor and I'm on the repelling side
and<00:01:14.110> you<00:01:14.170> can<00:01:14.320> feel<00:01:14.710> it<00:01:14.740> go<00:01:15.039> up<00:01:15.219> and<00:01:15.340> down<00:01:15.579> as

00:01:15.840 --> 00:01:15.850 
and you can feel it go up and down as

00:01:15.850 --> 00:01:18.539 
and you can feel it go up and down as
I'm<00:01:16.109> repelling<00:01:17.109> it<00:01:17.259> and<00:01:17.770> it<00:01:17.950> actually<00:01:18.219> stops

00:01:18.539 --> 00:01:18.549 
I'm repelling it and it actually stops

00:01:18.549 --> 00:01:25.560 
I'm repelling it and it actually stops
faster<00:01:19.240> than<00:01:20.170> if<00:01:20.289> I<00:01:20.409> just<00:01:20.439> left<00:01:20.920> it<00:01:21.840> right

00:01:25.560 --> 00:01:25.570 

00:01:25.570 --> 00:01:29.610 

so<00:01:26.340> it<00:01:27.340> doesn't<00:01:27.730> work<00:01:28.060> it<00:01:28.510> would<00:01:28.660> be<00:01:28.690> nice<00:01:29.050> it'd

00:01:29.610 --> 00:01:29.620 
so it doesn't work it would be nice it'd

00:01:29.620 --> 00:01:32.250 
so it doesn't work it would be nice it'd
be<00:01:29.740> pretty<00:01:29.920> cool<00:01:30.600> if<00:01:31.600> someone<00:01:31.900> could<00:01:32.020> figure

00:01:32.250 --> 00:01:32.260 
be pretty cool if someone could figure

00:01:32.260 --> 00:01:37.500 
be pretty cool if someone could figure
out<00:01:32.380> a<00:01:32.530> way<00:01:32.560> to<00:01:32.710> get<00:01:33.370> it<00:01:33.550> to<00:01:33.580> I<00:01:35.970> don't<00:01:36.970> know<00:01:37.210> jump

00:01:37.500 --> 00:01:37.510 
out a way to get it to I don't know jump

00:01:37.510 --> 00:01:42.540 
out a way to get it to I don't know jump
past<00:01:39.150> these<00:01:40.150> are<00:01:40.210> and<00:01:40.840> fifty<00:01:41.560> or<00:01:41.590> whatever<00:01:42.310> the

00:01:42.540 --> 00:01:42.550 
past these are and fifty or whatever the

00:01:42.550 --> 00:01:44.640 
past these are and fifty or whatever the
fifty<00:01:43.030> label<00:01:43.390> is<00:01:43.540> these<00:01:43.750> are<00:01:43.870> like<00:01:43.960> crazy

00:01:44.640 --> 00:01:44.650 
fifty label is these are like crazy

00:01:44.650 --> 00:01:48.750 
fifty label is these are like crazy
strong<00:01:45.100> actually<00:01:46.030> so<00:01:46.240> strong<00:01:46.600> that<00:01:46.920> if<00:01:47.920> they

00:01:48.750 --> 00:01:48.760 
strong actually so strong that if they

00:01:48.760 --> 00:01:50.490 
strong actually so strong that if they
attract<00:01:49.180> from<00:01:49.420> too<00:01:49.600> far<00:01:49.780> away<00:01:49.900> low<00:01:50.140> break<00:01:50.380> in

00:01:50.490 --> 00:01:50.500 
attract from too far away low break in

00:01:50.500 --> 00:01:57.390 
attract from too far away low break in
half<00:01:51.090> debunked<00:01:52.110> it<00:01:53.110> does<00:01:53.440> not<00:01:54.750> work<00:01:56.340> thank<00:01:57.340> you
