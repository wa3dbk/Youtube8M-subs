00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.720
 Hello youtube and welcome to one 

00:00:01.620 --> 00:00:05.810
 new video after a long long time 

00:00:03.720 --> 00:00:09.450
 let's take the google nexus again 

00:00:05.810 --> 00:00:12.059
 4 in front of her already knows the 299 euro 

00:00:09.450 --> 00:00:14.070
 smartphone but if you b 299 euros 

00:00:12.059 --> 00:00:16.800
 buys you have the disadvantage is only 

00:00:14.070 --> 00:00:19.100
 eight gigabytes of storage space installed and 

00:00:16.800 --> 00:00:21.390
 The thing has no micro sd card slot 

00:00:19.100 --> 00:00:23.220
 So how far can you get from me? 

00:00:21.390 --> 00:00:26.580
 At the beginning there were very many 

00:00:23.220 --> 00:00:28.349
 calls that is not enough and and and me 

00:00:26.580 --> 00:00:31.969
 have the thing since the beginning of the 

00:00:28.349 --> 00:00:34.460
 time was that came out in the permanent use 

00:00:31.969 --> 00:00:36.930
 several hours a day ever 

00:00:34.460 --> 00:00:39.059
 parallel to the iphone 5 weishaupt mobile phone 

00:00:36.930 --> 00:00:40.829
 and the integrated switch too 

00:00:39.059 --> 00:00:42.329
 so I can say yes 

00:00:40.829 --> 00:00:44.700
 I'll come with me for a week 

00:00:42.329 --> 00:00:50.399
 the nexus 7 from all lexus 4 and 

00:00:44.700 --> 00:00:52.170
 we'll just have a look at ours 

00:00:50.399 --> 00:00:55.739
 entire memory we still free 

00:00:52.170 --> 00:00:57.510
 5.6 7 gb sounds like that can move 

00:00:55.739 --> 00:00:59.250
 yes even less than eight gigabytes is 

00:00:57.510 --> 00:01:02.640
 because it is simply a technician 

00:00:59.250 --> 00:01:03.480
 I still have 1.23 gigabytes 

00:01:02.640 --> 00:01:06.060
 available 

00:01:03.480 --> 00:01:07.439
 Now let's have a look at what 

00:01:06.060 --> 00:01:09.750
 that lies or how much I like that 

00:01:07.439 --> 00:01:12.119
 Consumption so far I had none 

00:01:09.750 --> 00:01:14.340
 problems in everyday use absolutely 

00:01:12.119 --> 00:01:18.229
 not we can indeed times near 

00:01:14.340 --> 00:01:20.670
 so watch 850 mw go in ebbs 

00:01:18.229 --> 00:01:22.110
 there is still an overview but 

00:01:20.670 --> 00:01:24.450
 not really but there are 

00:01:22.110 --> 00:01:26.490
 music data at google music 

00:01:24.450 --> 00:01:28.290
 downloaded there is somehow fell 

00:01:26.490 --> 00:01:32.400
 chrome what I just do not know why 

00:01:28.290 --> 00:01:35.670
 facebook google + twitter instagram the 

00:01:32.400 --> 00:01:38.250
 save everything nice on my 

00:01:35.670 --> 00:01:39.270
 device now takes fun times 

00:01:38.250 --> 00:01:40.350
 not as much 

00:01:39.270 --> 00:01:43.409
 then we'll take a look at the next one 

00:01:40.350 --> 00:01:45.710
 department 1 pictures and videos 18 2 

00:01:43.409 --> 00:01:48.090
 gigabyte on the ground what on two gigabytes 

00:01:45.710 --> 00:01:51.450
 and I snapped it like stupid 

00:01:48.090 --> 00:01:52.680
 are also some videos on it I have 

00:01:51.450 --> 00:01:55.619
 not brought her down yet 

00:01:52.680 --> 00:01:58.350
 So there's room there I'm not on 

00:01:55.619 --> 00:01:59.969
 the borders audio tones music so the 

00:01:58.350 --> 00:02:03.060
 yes the apps are saved in the field 

00:01:59.969 --> 00:02:05.100
 I then on there are downloads I show 

00:02:03.060 --> 00:02:06.240
 you right files in the cash can I 

00:02:05.100 --> 00:02:09.330
 delete me at any time then there's still 

00:02:06.240 --> 00:02:11.400
 other 400 more nearly 500 mb that 

00:02:09.330 --> 00:02:12.010
 then buy an audiobook order in there 

00:02:11.400 --> 00:02:14.620
 parties 

00:02:12.010 --> 00:02:16.659
 files stored at mega and 

00:02:14.620 --> 00:02:18.340
 otherwise just so small stuff 

00:02:16.659 --> 00:02:21.340
 so that you imagine then under it 

00:02:18.340 --> 00:02:23.680
 can have a short time to spotify there 

00:02:21.340 --> 00:02:25.989
 So here I am loosely about 200 lidl 

00:02:23.680 --> 00:02:28.000
 songs are also saved download 

00:02:25.989 --> 00:02:30.730
 If you know something I know 

00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:32.530
 leave it by two so something 

00:02:30.730 --> 00:02:33.730
 between 10 and 20 albums are on it 

00:02:32.530 --> 00:02:35.110
 saved so much higher I'm not there 

00:02:33.730 --> 00:02:37.150
 I can come over the day comfortably over the 

00:02:35.110 --> 00:02:38.319
 week itself, I would 

00:02:37.150 --> 00:02:40.390
 probably not all songs through 

00:02:38.319 --> 00:02:42.280
 I've heard that , I said 

00:02:40.390 --> 00:02:45.400
 downloaded a radio play fits so well 

00:02:42.280 --> 00:02:47.349
 Also photos and what else was I 

00:02:45.400 --> 00:02:49.299
 you exactly the other stuff almost what 

00:02:47.349 --> 00:02:51.040
 a gigabyte was this is in 

00:02:49.299 --> 00:02:54.190
 Filemanager and there is then just times 

00:02:51.040 --> 00:02:56.349
 a sequel to wegberg fury and from the 

00:02:54.190 --> 00:02:58.030
 simpsons on it then I also 

00:02:56.349 --> 00:03:00.099
 just look for the case if 

00:02:58.030 --> 00:03:01.659
 now one is coming and cold films or something 

00:03:00.099 --> 00:03:02.319
 he can safely pack and then 

00:03:01.659 --> 00:03:05.409
 do it too 

00:03:02.319 --> 00:03:07.290
 So that was actually the tour thing 

00:03:05.409 --> 00:03:10.030
 should i say i still have 1.3 

00:03:07.290 --> 00:03:11.440
 gigabyte free i could have two 

00:03:10.030 --> 00:03:13.810
 gigabyte simply shovel me 

00:03:11.440 --> 00:03:15.489
 all the pictures on the computer 

00:03:13.810 --> 00:03:16.900
 Cover offs wet on an external 

00:03:15.489 --> 00:03:18.579
 plate or wherever 

00:03:16.900 --> 00:03:20.139
 then I'll get through it again 

00:03:18.579 --> 00:03:22.690
 wonderful about the rounds 

00:03:20.139 --> 00:03:24.609
 Of course, many now say 8 20 albums 

00:03:22.690 --> 00:03:26.799
 are too few for me and two follow 

00:03:24.609 --> 00:03:28.900
 simpsons or big bang theory I want 

00:03:26.799 --> 00:03:30.069
 two stagger have come there then 

00:03:28.900 --> 00:03:31.769
 not here ran de 

00:03:30.069 --> 00:03:35.620
 Of course I just wanted to say for 

00:03:31.769 --> 00:03:37.870
 normal user behavior is enough for the 8 

00:03:35.620 --> 00:03:39.129
 gigabyte certainly from we also see 

00:03:37.870 --> 00:03:41.590
 apps do not take that much 

00:03:39.129 --> 00:03:44.470
 space away what was here for the 

00:03:41.590 --> 00:03:47.949
 Storage period is unit of thick files 

00:03:44.470 --> 00:03:49.239
 in the app itself what now 

00:03:47.949 --> 00:03:51.129
 I noticed right up 

00:03:49.239 --> 00:03:53.319
 I do not have a single game here ingres 

00:03:51.129 --> 00:03:54.430
 installed on it then becomes 

00:03:53.319 --> 00:03:56.500
 Of course, a few more gigabytes 

00:03:54.430 --> 00:03:58.629
 depending on what I am there 

00:03:56.500 --> 00:03:59.260
 pull on it but of course I still have 

00:03:58.629 --> 00:04:03.940
 something free 

00:03:59.260 --> 00:04:06.040
 that was my memory video i say 

00:04:03.940 --> 00:04:09.549
 Now just come I'm wonderful 

00:04:06.040 --> 00:04:12.940
 with these eight or 56 7 gigabytes off 

00:04:09.549 --> 00:04:14.470
 I have no problem and will 

00:04:12.940 --> 00:04:16.419
 then of course when I go in holidays 

00:04:14.470 --> 00:04:19.269
 The pictures of down throw at the 

00:04:16.419 --> 00:04:21.889
 apps still sort out the crash times 

00:04:19.269 --> 00:04:24.169
 teachers and whatever they do 

00:04:21.889 --> 00:04:26.270
 that will probably be the most likely 

00:04:24.169 --> 00:04:27.949
 panic would not have that one to me 

00:04:26.270 --> 00:04:29.050
 week on vacation then no pictures 

00:04:27.949 --> 00:04:32.360
 can do more 

00:04:29.050 --> 00:04:34.639
 that was my video to the memory many 

00:04:32.360 --> 00:04:37.629
 Thanks for watching makes it good and up 

00:04:34.639 --> 00:04:37.629
 to the next video 1
