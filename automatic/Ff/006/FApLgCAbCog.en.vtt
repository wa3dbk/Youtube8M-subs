00:00:08.200 --> 00:00:12.010

00:00:30.820 --> 00:00:34.350
 about history 

00:00:36.280 --> 00:00:40.360

00:00:40.360 --> 00:00:44.980
 we first arrived at this store that has 

00:00:42.039 --> 00:00:47.460
 Japanese things and this is what to me 

00:00:44.980 --> 00:00:47.460
 fascinates 

00:00:51.400 --> 00:00:56.190
 these are wooden sandals that are 

00:00:53.380 --> 00:01:00.260
 they call tag 

00:00:56.190 --> 00:01:00.260

00:01:06.260 --> 00:01:11.450

00:01:08.300 --> 00:01:13.100
 appreciate this beautiful forest now you 

00:01:11.450 --> 00:01:15.410
 I'm going to practice the relationship that the 

00:01:13.100 --> 00:01:18.140
 name of the street with mexico time 

00:01:15.410 --> 00:01:20.780
 behind a ship that left Mexico in 

00:01:18.140 --> 00:01:23.090
 back then Spain was not heading 

00:01:20.780 --> 00:01:25.310
 the Philippine islands in their return to 

00:01:23.090 --> 00:01:27.290
 Mexican ship wrecked near one of 

00:01:25.310 --> 00:01:29.210
 the beaches of this area the people of 'ot' 

00:01:27.290 --> 00:01:31.220
 here they have gone and they gave them lodging 

00:01:29.210 --> 00:01:33.440
 all the crew of the ship were 

00:01:31.220 --> 00:01:35.810
 as 300 and 7 people were given permission 

00:01:33.440 --> 00:01:38.120
 to stay while they fixed the boat 

00:01:35.810 --> 00:01:39.950
 it took them good time and from 

00:01:38.120 --> 00:01:42.530
 then japan and mexico have had a 

00:01:39.950 --> 00:01:44.030
 relationship is the sister city of drop 

00:01:42.530 --> 00:01:45.890
 here is the city of Cuernavaca in 

00:01:44.030 --> 00:01:48.500
 mexico I'm not sure why not 

00:01:45.890 --> 00:01:50.660
 They could tell if I got to know them 

00:01:48.500 --> 00:01:54.760
 I leave an annotation below in the video or 

00:01:50.660 --> 00:01:54.760
 if you know please let's see 

00:02:06.130 --> 00:02:10.060
 this is inside the castle that is now 

00:02:08.140 --> 00:02:11.980
 a museum and it's a very beautiful castle that 

00:02:10.060 --> 00:02:14.769
 It has been rebuilt many times but 

00:02:11.980 --> 00:02:16.390
 always exactly the original good 

00:02:14.769 --> 00:02:19.530
 let's go inside I'm sure not 

00:02:16.390 --> 00:02:19.530
 they are going to stop recording 

00:02:20.680 --> 00:02:26.290
 as good 

00:02:23.150 --> 00:02:26.290
 but it is declared 

00:02:26.420 --> 00:02:30.760
 in this showcase they have coins 

00:02:38.630 --> 00:02:45.560
 mirrors together 

00:02:41.819 --> 00:02:45.560
 with combs that are women 

00:02:47.380 --> 00:02:51.430
 that is the portrait of the modest castle 

00:02:49.570 --> 00:02:53.610
 that apparently did not like how 

00:02:51.430 --> 00:02:56.110
 they portrayed and they had to do it 

00:02:53.610 --> 00:02:58.770
 nine portraits until the guy who 

00:02:56.110 --> 00:02:58.770
 contender 

00:03:07.420 --> 00:03:12.280

00:03:25.460 --> 00:03:30.170
 the private ones do not have to reserve them 

00:03:27.050 --> 00:03:32.870

00:03:30.170 --> 00:03:35.240
 people are going to the public and if men and 

00:03:32.870 --> 00:03:37.120
 separated women for those who were the 

00:03:35.240 --> 00:03:40.750
 Question 

00:03:37.120 --> 00:03:43.650
