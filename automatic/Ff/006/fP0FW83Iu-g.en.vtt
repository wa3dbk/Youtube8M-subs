00:00:00.099 --> 00:00:04.330
 percent 

00:00:05.740 --> 00:00:08.740
 percent 

00:00:09.589 --> 00:00:13.699
 the ladies and gentlemen in this country and people I tell a little bit the patience 

00:00:13.699 --> 00:00:14.709
 start 

00:00:14.709 --> 00:00:16.089
 in lines 

00:00:16.089 --> 00:00:21.050
 States have advantages and disadvantages and at least as many disadvantages 

00:00:21.050 --> 00:00:22.239
 the advantages 

00:00:22.239 --> 00:00:23.630
 if not more 

00:00:23.630 --> 00:00:26.760
 it turns now simply the question Waas 

00:00:26.760 --> 00:00:28.810
 Physics skims the good 

00:00:28.810 --> 00:00:31.060
 - and the bad numbers 

00:00:31.060 --> 00:00:33.219
 when starting there is down there 

00:00:33.219 --> 00:00:37.920
 that are made similar to me, for example if they are made together 

00:00:37.920 --> 00:00:39.140
 was up here 

00:00:39.140 --> 00:00:40.609
 watch this game 

00:00:40.609 --> 00:00:43.579
 that is started you recognize a stack 

00:00:43.579 --> 00:00:48.640
 by casting Beckett called that the state of the Philippines are in the pile 

00:00:48.640 --> 00:00:51.609
 and by means of this creates next to the lines 

00:00:51.609 --> 00:00:55.070
 if you click on it you can get the stack of tires 

00:00:55.070 --> 00:00:56.410
 and close 

00:00:56.410 --> 00:01:00.600
 much easier is the particle and closing a pile of construction work 

00:01:00.600 --> 00:01:02.380
 Gebhardts de Elz 

00:01:02.380 --> 00:01:04.580
 it weighs SGA 

00:01:04.580 --> 00:01:08.740
 how can you make a stack even very short 

00:01:08.740 --> 00:01:11.250
 if you select several pictures 

00:01:11.250 --> 00:01:15.780
 So they just can not be missed Georgen Kontor the exciting effect 

00:01:15.780 --> 00:01:17.910
 the bea-group if you like 

00:01:17.910 --> 00:01:20.930
 that does not give you any reasons 

00:01:21.690 --> 00:01:25.560
 and Sven she chooses to go wrong elites just think 

00:01:25.560 --> 00:01:29.060
 be neat the products have to keep on worrying if we have any 

00:01:29.060 --> 00:01:29.990
 remained 

00:01:29.990 --> 00:01:31.540
 dangerous g 

00:01:31.540 --> 00:01:34.520
 if that's what these states are 

00:01:34.520 --> 00:01:35.710
 the advantage 

00:01:35.710 --> 00:01:38.220
 what are the disadvantages 

00:01:38.220 --> 00:01:40.420
 first received before 

00:01:40.420 --> 00:01:44.990
 Look, I've been using a couple of pictures stuff like that 

00:01:44.990 --> 00:01:47.200
 this picture de 

00:01:47.200 --> 00:01:50.080
 it is a picture later the edited picture 

00:01:50.080 --> 00:01:52.330
 that easily wins years old 

00:01:52.330 --> 00:01:54.470
 they see that is actually distributed 

00:01:54.470 --> 00:01:58.880
 the skin of the same name as the Lord party is very important to me like that 

00:01:58.880 --> 00:02:00.030
 at any time 

00:02:00.030 --> 00:02:03.720
 Recognizable here at this time 

00:02:03.720 --> 00:02:04.630
 but 

00:02:04.630 --> 00:02:10.030
 the file on the right side this has arisen at a later date 

00:02:10.819 --> 00:02:15.510
 Now the problem comes from playing well if they are for example data 

00:02:15.510 --> 00:02:19.819
 Immediately they do in the Thurgau if they did not look, they looked the 

00:02:19.819 --> 00:02:21.159
 Costs are 

00:02:21.159 --> 00:02:23.310
 if for example a place 

00:02:23.310 --> 00:02:25.140
 this may have consequences 

00:02:25.140 --> 00:02:26.269
 those at the test 

00:02:26.269 --> 00:02:29.349
 for example when I say that time will be given 

00:02:30.239 --> 00:02:34.769
 then the pictures are suddenly torn apart that means that 

00:02:34.769 --> 00:02:38.949
 Original picture priest above us another picture 

00:02:38.949 --> 00:02:40.959
 is with us 

00:02:40.959 --> 00:02:46.249
 and this relatively cumbersome when they are there we have thousands of pictures 

00:02:46.249 --> 00:02:47.679
 to recognize 

00:02:47.679 --> 00:02:50.959
 where the original picture was 

00:02:50.959 --> 00:02:56.150
 You see, I've got in Berlin, too, have started already started 

00:02:56.150 --> 00:02:58.360
 she thanked them together 

00:02:58.360 --> 00:03:02.620
 he thinks you are open and they are closed together 

00:03:02.620 --> 00:03:06.510
 Also, if a band is there their action is in effect 

00:03:07.859 --> 00:03:09.500
 the players are back 

00:03:09.500 --> 00:03:13.230
 This will not happen to me even if I do not stack 

00:03:13.230 --> 00:03:16.060
 waldshut-tiengen neighbor participation 

00:03:16.060 --> 00:03:19.279
 and the parties have been built to be here 

00:03:19.279 --> 00:03:23.419
 chronologically at the time of the act a corresponding percentage 

00:03:23.419 --> 00:03:27.819
 nonetheless, the team can help 

00:03:27.819 --> 00:03:31.459
 the work was valued to have similar offenses together 

00:03:32.199 --> 00:03:36.539
 What you see was the disadvantages of a state I would have hoped for 

00:03:37.059 --> 00:03:38.940
 I go there, for example 

00:03:38.940 --> 00:03:43.269
 and really every start in these two volumes compassion gg 

00:03:43.269 --> 00:03:45.739
 You also notice that this way 

00:03:45.739 --> 00:03:49.660
 is added at the beginning of the state on 1 

00:03:49.660 --> 00:03:51.959
 that sounds pretty awkward to do it 

00:03:51.959 --> 00:03:55.289
 By the way, there are still a short a dozen 

00:03:55.289 --> 00:03:57.709
 if you create a strong one 

00:03:57.709 --> 00:04:01.799
 whoever wins now will be far from us the tests above 

00:04:01.799 --> 00:04:05.380
 in the rectory destroyed interesting 

00:04:05.380 --> 00:04:07.299
 with the slightly smaller frame 

00:04:07.299 --> 00:04:10.229
 if I play this picture, for example 

00:04:10.229 --> 00:04:12.179
 thought of seven victories 

00:04:12.179 --> 00:04:16.299
 or Dallas make sure they do not bet on it 

00:04:16.299 --> 00:04:17.489
 the complete picture 

00:04:17.489 --> 00:04:19.739
 Wedel in the sell out 

00:04:19.739 --> 00:04:23.730
 So if I choose to call this picture on the staff, for example, then I do 

00:04:23.729 --> 00:04:28.080
 this picture first then it is dry from the lette picture 

00:04:28.080 --> 00:04:29.920
 and is really dangerous 

00:04:29.920 --> 00:04:33.300
 and then automatically this picture fits main house is 

00:04:33.300 --> 00:04:35.090
 is whole 

00:04:35.090 --> 00:04:39.120
 I'll leave soon but that's one of the operations on the edge 

00:04:39.120 --> 00:04:40.650
 this morality 

00:04:40.650 --> 00:04:45.360
 I'm annoyed sometimes even a start at Opel to buy a good partner 

00:04:45.360 --> 00:04:47.969
 give and this time it works 

00:04:47.969 --> 00:04:50.969
 m what 

00:04:53.229 --> 00:04:56.379
 And if I look at this now, you add 

00:04:57.400 --> 00:05:00.479
 then you see that this is what you are looking though 

00:05:00.479 --> 00:05:03.610
 Jen the minis at this one in Biel 

00:05:04.499 --> 00:05:07.550
 it is always simply not give 37 

00:05:08.080 --> 00:05:09.319
 what are you looking at 

00:05:09.319 --> 00:05:10.610
 but I do 

00:05:10.610 --> 00:05:12.720
 the best starter example 

00:05:12.720 --> 00:05:18.580
 and look at this picture then here is part of keyword to see that is the 

00:05:18.580 --> 00:05:20.120
 States 

00:05:20.120 --> 00:05:22.990
 They are kind of like an ECG laptop 

00:05:22.990 --> 00:05:28.210
 For example, if they call BMW l, they have to put up with slogans 

00:05:29.039 --> 00:05:35.270
 Develop images Image Export APA Do not look in these countries 

00:05:35.270 --> 00:05:38.589
 especially festive is just porting the text 

00:05:38.589 --> 00:05:40.539
 if they are each 

00:05:40.539 --> 00:05:46.099
 next to no one was exporting the chart image and 

00:05:46.099 --> 00:05:48.330
 not those that are underneath 

00:05:48.330 --> 00:05:52.389
 and maybe they can keep a dog in the year but the lions also stayed that year 

00:05:52.389 --> 00:05:53.310
 Idea for 

00:05:53.310 --> 00:05:55.300
 Percent Red Image for 

00:05:55.300 --> 00:05:57.930
 v image of the DAX 

00:05:57.930 --> 00:06:00.460
 then you just have to think about it when you are 

00:06:00.460 --> 00:06:04.690
 Borussia Dortmund rose percent climbed St had been awarded 

00:06:04.690 --> 00:06:07.430
 of course counts with the mistake was 

00:06:07.430 --> 00:06:11.250
 select all images to kill the test phase 

00:06:11.250 --> 00:06:14.700
 that opened up and finally what they do 

00:06:14.700 --> 00:06:16.529
 to join the states 

00:06:16.529 --> 00:06:19.260
 or you can also say photo 

00:06:19.260 --> 00:06:20.520
 start 

00:06:20.520 --> 00:06:23.710
 and then they told me Barber staff of objections 

00:06:23.710 --> 00:06:28.370
 and that also opens sleep and then all are visible again in the double 

00:06:28.370 --> 00:06:29.879
 senses 

00:06:29.879 --> 00:06:30.319
 Right
