course this is a LMT version 1.86 by

00:02:24.990 --> 00:02:28.550 
course this is a LMT version 1.86 by
no-name<00:02:25.770> 81<00:02:26.570> you<00:02:27.570> got<00:02:27.720> your<00:02:27.780> gestures<00:02:28.260> which

no-name 81 you got your gestures which
you<00:02:28.710> can<00:02:28.860> do<00:02:29.040> this<00:02:29.490> can<00:02:29.730> act<00:02:30.210> as<00:02:30.450> I<00:02:30.840> mean<00:02:31.200> it's

00:02:31.310 --> 00:02:31.320 
you can do this can act as I mean it's

00:02:31.320 --> 00:02:33.050 
you can do this can act as I mean it's
similar<00:02:31.530> to<00:02:31.680> when<00:02:32.070> launchers<00:02:32.460> have<00:02:32.640> gestures

00:02:33.050 --> 00:02:33.060 
similar to when launchers have gestures

00:02:33.060 --> 00:02:35.030 
similar to when launchers have gestures
to<00:02:33.300> like<00:02:33.570> when<00:02:34.020> I<00:02:34.050> swipe<00:02:34.380> up<00:02:34.620> on<00:02:34.770> my<00:02:34.860> home

00:02:35.030 --> 00:02:35.040 
to like when I swipe up on my home

00:02:35.040 --> 00:02:37.430 
to like when I swipe up on my home
screen<00:02:35.070> it<00:02:35.550> you<00:02:35.970> know<00:02:36.120> it<00:02:36.330> brings<00:02:36.900> up<00:02:37.050> my<00:02:37.230> app

00:02:37.430 --> 00:02:37.440 
screen it you know it brings up my app

00:02:37.440 --> 00:02:41.720 
screen it you know it brings up my app
drawer<00:02:38.060> aissa<00:02:39.060> I<00:02:39.540> really<00:02:39.870> haven't<00:02:40.730> messed

00:02:41.720 --> 00:02:41.730 
drawer aissa I really haven't messed

00:02:41.730 --> 00:02:43.910 
drawer aissa I really haven't messed
with<00:02:41.940> either<00:02:42.150> but<00:02:42.690> it's<00:02:42.810> got<00:02:42.960> a<00:02:42.990> visual<00:02:43.260> yeah

00:02:43.910 --> 00:02:43.920 
with either but it's got a visual yeah

00:02:43.920 --> 00:02:46.940 
with either but it's got a visual yeah
it's<00:02:44.370> basically<00:02:44.730> invisible<00:02:45.300> swipe<00:02:46.050> areas<00:02:46.680> so

00:02:46.940 --> 00:02:46.950 
it's basically invisible swipe areas so

00:02:46.950 --> 00:02:48.290 
it's basically invisible swipe areas so
I<00:02:46.980> mean<00:02:47.280> there's<00:02:47.430> a<00:02:47.520> lot<00:02:47.550> of<00:02:47.790> these<00:02:48.030> available

00:02:48.290 --> 00:02:48.300 
I mean there's a lot of these available

00:02:48.300 --> 00:02:51.230 
I mean there's a lot of these available
swiping<00:02:49.080> and<00:02:49.350> gesturing<00:02:50.040> going<00:02:50.280> on<00:02:50.400> but<00:02:51.000> right

00:02:51.230 --> 00:02:51.240

00:02:53.120 --> 00:02:53.130 
here is what I dealt with was because

00:02:53.130 --> 00:02:55.700 
here is what I dealt with was because
obviously<00:02:53.970> this<00:02:54.330> is<00:02:54.540> where<00:02:54.780> you<00:02:54.930> put<00:02:55.140> stuff<00:02:55.470> on

00:02:55.700 --> 00:02:55.710 
obviously this is where you put stuff on

just<00:03:23.400> so<00:03:23.520> futuristic<00:03:23.910> looking<00:03:24.480> you<00:03:24.989> know<00:03:25.020> I

00:03:25.340 --> 00:03:25.350 
just so futuristic looking you know I

00:03:25.350 --> 00:03:27.320 
just so futuristic looking you know I
think<00:03:25.890> that's<00:03:26.130> what<00:03:26.280> it<00:03:26.370> is<00:03:26.400> like<00:03:27.060> it's<00:03:27.209> not

00:03:27.320 --> 00:03:27.330 
think that's what it is like it's not

00:03:27.330 --> 00:03:29.540 
think that's what it is like it's not
really<00:03:27.510> needed<00:03:27.989> technically<00:03:28.890> but<00:03:29.280> it<00:03:29.400> just

00:03:29.540 --> 00:03:29.550 
really needed technically but it just

00:03:29.550 --> 00:03:32.270 
really needed technically but it just
looks<00:03:29.820> so<00:03:30.030> cool<00:03:30.620> but<00:03:31.620> yeah<00:03:31.770> you<00:03:31.830> could<00:03:32.070> choose
