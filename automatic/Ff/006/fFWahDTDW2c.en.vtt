00:00:15.200 --> 00:00:19.490
 Expectations are a boat that have it 

00:00:18.200 --> 00:00:22.100
 we were tasty because you were going 

00:00:19.490 --> 00:00:25.030
 I am going I have to say that I am sitting 

00:00:22.100 --> 00:00:25.030
 people talk about the weather 

00:00:32.890 --> 00:00:37.090
 the bowery make use of fit 

00:00:34.420 --> 00:00:39.250
 stability the principle of cycling that 

00:00:37.090 --> 00:00:40.570
 it's also the same principle but 

00:00:39.250 --> 00:00:42.160
 the empire all slightly different 

00:00:40.570 --> 00:00:43.960
 planted on the water 

00:00:42.160 --> 00:00:46.060
 that is quite difficult but in addition 

00:00:43.960 --> 00:00:49.330
 is very cool but in the end 

00:00:46.060 --> 00:00:51.310
 indeed can drive those boats and 

00:00:49.330 --> 00:00:54.000
 like flying over the water 

00:00:51.310 --> 00:00:54.000
 a bike actually 

00:01:03.560 --> 00:01:06.170
 eventually have one 

00:01:04.250 --> 00:01:08.420
 go through the selection process what started 

00:01:06.170 --> 00:01:09.860
 with demand and every team has to take their 

00:01:08.420 --> 00:01:11.330
 give preference 

00:01:09.860 --> 00:01:12.830
 I signed up to sail those boats 

00:01:11.330 --> 00:01:14.660
 and finally is last week and late 

00:01:12.830 --> 00:01:16.400
 I decided to open it again first 

00:01:14.660 --> 00:01:18.970
 that I indeed did the boat during the race 

00:01:16.400 --> 00:01:18.970
 may start driving 

00:01:29.110 --> 00:01:33.189
 exact task is of course to be good 

00:01:31.270 --> 00:01:36.520
 to be equipped well too 

00:01:33.189 --> 00:01:38.259
 that boat can start driving a week there 

00:01:36.520 --> 00:01:39.610
 will not only have to control level 

00:01:38.259 --> 00:01:41.680
 but must also pay close attention 

00:01:39.610 --> 00:01:42.880
 keep what is being said to me 

00:01:41.680 --> 00:01:45.130
 I finally got all tasks from 

00:01:42.880 --> 00:01:46.000
 the pub side they determine the 

00:01:45.130 --> 00:01:48.610
 strategy 

00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:50.860
 by hard I have to sail and eventually 

00:01:48.610 --> 00:01:51.580
 my job is to properly handle those orders 

00:01:50.860 --> 00:01:52.960
 to follow 

00:01:51.580 --> 00:01:54.940
 that is what really makes the boat special 

00:01:52.960 --> 00:01:56.830
 indeed the bike is and therefore 

00:01:54.940 --> 00:01:59.070
 you can get a lot of efficient value 

00:01:56.830 --> 00:01:59.070
 goods 

00:01:59.120 --> 00:02:01.240
 No
