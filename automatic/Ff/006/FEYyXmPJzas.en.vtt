00:04:58.620 --> 00:04:58.630 
barely but I would hit that a/c unit

00:04:58.630 --> 00:05:02.280 
barely but I would hit that a/c unit
every<00:04:58.840> time<00:04:59.100> so<00:05:00.100> I'm<00:05:00.370> six<00:05:00.669> foot<00:05:00.940> and<00:05:01.120> I'm<00:05:01.600> this

00:05:05.880 --> 00:05:05.890 
theaters right at six foot so there'd be

00:05:05.890 --> 00:05:07.500 
theaters right at six foot so there'd be
a<00:05:05.919> slight<00:05:06.280> knee<00:05:06.610> bin<00:05:06.820> which<00:05:07.060> I<00:05:07.180> could<00:05:07.330> probably

00:05:07.500 --> 00:05:07.510 
a slight knee bin which I could probably

00:05:07.510 --> 00:05:13.260 
a slight knee bin which I could probably
deal<00:05:07.870> with<00:05:08.520> but<00:05:11.130> this<00:05:12.130> it's<00:05:12.400> when<00:05:13.000> you<00:05:13.120> get
