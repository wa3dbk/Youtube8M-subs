00:00:23.939 --> 00:00:38.450 
nerve hammer the nerve hand was an
ex-racer<00:00:34.730> and<00:00:36.590> it's<00:00:37.590> hard<00:00:37.800> to<00:00:37.920> tell<00:00:38.100> in<00:00:38.309> this

00:01:34.010 --> 00:01:34.020 
was the next one that's from 2011 from

00:01:34.020 --> 00:01:36.740 
was the next one that's from 2011 from
the<00:01:34.170> track<00:01:34.439> stars<00:01:35.270> and<00:01:36.270> it<00:01:36.390> has<00:01:36.570> that

00:01:36.740 --> 00:01:36.750 
the track stars and it has that

00:01:36.750 --> 00:01:40.840 
the track stars and it has that
signature<00:01:37.079> little<00:01:38.090> thing<00:01:39.090> right<00:01:39.570> there

00:01:40.840 --> 00:01:40.850 
signature little thing right there

00:01:40.850 --> 00:01:43.520 
signature little thing right there
they're<00:01:41.850> all<00:01:42.000> different<00:01:42.390> a<00:01:43.020> little<00:01:43.380> bit

00:01:43.520 --> 00:01:43.530

different<00:01:44.070> but<00:01:44.220> it's<00:01:44.460> got<00:01:44.670> that<00:01:44.700> little<00:01:45.090> thing

00:01:47.499 --> 00:01:47.509 

00:01:47.509 --> 00:01:51.980 

10/10<00:01:48.509> spoke<00:01:48.899> wheels

00:01:51.980 --> 00:01:51.990 

00:01:51.990 --> 00:01:58.899 

a<00:01:54.500> little<00:01:55.500> bit<00:01:55.619> darker<00:01:56.040> windshield<00:01:56.720> color<00:01:57.720> a

a little bit darker windshield color a

00:01:58.909 --> 00:02:02.120 
a little bit darker windshield color a
little<00:01:59.909> bit<00:02:00.060> different<00:02:00.420> tempos<00:02:00.810> you<00:02:01.770> can<00:02:01.950> see

00:02:02.120 --> 00:02:02.130 
little bit different tempos you can see

00:02:02.130 --> 00:02:04.340 
little bit different tempos you can see
on<00:02:02.250> the<00:02:02.369> 11<00:02:02.790> I<00:02:03.119> believe<00:02:03.570> this<00:02:03.960> was<00:02:04.170> the<00:02:04.200> only

00:02:04.340 --> 00:02:04.350 
on the 11 I believe this was the only

00:02:04.350 --> 00:02:08.210 
on the 11 I believe this was the only
color<00:02:04.710> from<00:02:05.039> 2011<00:02:05.759> and<00:02:06.750> they<00:02:07.560> all<00:02:07.710> had<00:02:07.950> that

00:02:08.210 --> 00:02:08.220 
color from 2011 and they all had that

00:02:08.220 --> 00:02:10.809 
color from 2011 and they all had that
all<00:02:08.729> the<00:02:09.030> track<00:02:09.300> stars<00:02:09.630> had<00:02:09.869> that<00:02:10.050> track<00:02:10.530> look

00:02:10.809 --> 00:02:10.819 
all the track stars had that track look

00:02:10.819 --> 00:02:15.530 
all the track stars had that track look
logo<00:02:11.819> from<00:02:12.030> that<00:02:12.209> year<00:02:13.910> as<00:02:14.910> you<00:02:15.060> can<00:02:15.209> see<00:02:15.390> on

logo from that year as you can see on

00:02:15.540 --> 00:02:17.180 
logo from that year as you can see on
this<00:02:15.750> this<00:02:16.140> is<00:02:16.290> another<00:02:16.410> one<00:02:16.769> of<00:02:16.890> them<00:02:17.010> on

00:02:17.180 --> 00:02:17.190 
this this is another one of them on

00:02:17.190 --> 00:02:20.540 
this this is another one of them on
track<00:02:17.910> stars<00:02:18.239> models<00:02:18.660> it's<00:02:18.840> got<00:02:19.080> the<00:02:19.550> that

00:02:20.540 --> 00:02:20.550 
track stars models it's got the that

00:02:20.550 --> 00:02:21.589 
track stars models it's got the that
logo<00:02:20.910> right<00:02:21.060> there

00:02:21.589 --> 00:02:21.599 
logo right there

00:02:21.599 --> 00:02:26.059

and<00:02:21.810> they<00:02:21.900> both<00:02:22.019> have<00:02:22.290> it<00:02:22.410> on<00:02:22.500> the<00:02:22.590> base<00:02:24.830> and<00:02:25.830> so

00:02:26.059 --> 00:02:26.069 
and they both have it on the base and so

00:02:26.069 --> 00:02:28.270 
and they both have it on the base and so
that<00:02:26.340> the<00:02:26.640> nerve<00:02:26.790> hammer<00:02:27.030> is<00:02:27.299> an<00:02:27.420> ex-racer

00:02:28.270 --> 00:02:28.280 
that the nerve hammer is an ex-racer

00:02:28.280 --> 00:02:31.550 
that the nerve hammer is an ex-racer
like<00:02:29.280> feel<00:02:30.239> like<00:02:30.390> this<00:02:30.600> one<00:02:30.840> is<00:02:30.870> the<00:02:31.170> paradigm

00:02:31.550 --> 00:02:31.560 
like feel like this one is the paradigm

00:02:31.560 --> 00:02:40.570 
like feel like this one is the paradigm
shift<00:02:37.910> they're<00:02:38.910> both<00:02:39.120> very<00:02:39.390> good<00:02:39.510> track<00:02:39.870> cars

00:02:40.570 --> 00:02:40.580

00:03:19.280 --> 00:03:19.290 
it's still a nice little book so uh yeah

00:03:19.290 --> 00:03:20.780 
it's still a nice little book so uh yeah
it<00:03:19.380> came<00:03:19.560> with<00:03:19.799> this<00:03:19.890> nerve<00:03:20.160> hammer<00:03:20.400> I<00:03:20.579> thought

00:03:20.780 --> 00:03:20.790 
it came with this nerve hammer I thought

00:03:20.790 --> 00:03:26.479 
it came with this nerve hammer I thought
it<00:03:20.910> was<00:03:21.000> really<00:03:21.780> cool<00:03:22.140> this<00:03:22.980> one<00:03:23.220> it's<00:03:24.000> the<00:03:25.489> way

00:03:26.479 --> 00:03:26.489 
it was really cool this one it's the way

00:03:26.489 --> 00:03:31.099 
it was really cool this one it's the way
is<00:03:26.760> the<00:03:26.970> 2212<00:03:27.959> nerve<00:03:28.530> hammer<00:03:29.090> you<00:03:30.090> can<00:03:30.150> say<00:03:30.480> see

00:03:31.099 --> 00:03:31.109 
is the 2212 nerve hammer you can say see

00:03:31.109 --> 00:03:36.020 
is the 2212 nerve hammer you can say see
same<00:03:31.470> tempos<00:03:32.810> number<00:03:33.810> six<00:03:34.109> and<00:03:34.410> wheels<00:03:35.030> except

00:03:36.020 --> 00:03:36.030 
same tempos number six and wheels except

00:03:36.030 --> 00:03:38.900 
same tempos number six and wheels except
it's<00:03:36.180> rare<00:03:36.480> but<00:03:37.139> I<00:03:37.590> know<00:03:38.010> there's<00:03:38.400> some

00:03:38.900 --> 00:03:38.910 
it's rare but I know there's some

00:03:38.910 --> 00:03:42.650 
it's rare but I know there's some
differences<00:03:40.040> one<00:03:41.040> this<00:03:41.609> is<00:03:41.790> a<00:03:41.819> dark<00:03:42.209> smoked

00:03:42.650 --> 00:03:42.660

00:04:11.340 --> 00:04:11.350 
stripe and one of the big differences

00:04:11.350 --> 00:04:15.240 
stripe and one of the big differences
was<00:04:12.510> as<00:04:13.510> you'll<00:04:13.750> notice<00:04:14.080> with<00:04:14.230> the<00:04:14.350> 2011<00:04:15.010> and

00:04:15.240 --> 00:04:15.250 
was as you'll notice with the 2011 and

00:04:15.250 --> 00:04:18.479 
was as you'll notice with the 2011 and
2013<00:04:15.910> model<00:04:16.720> they<00:04:17.230> switched<00:04:17.620> this<00:04:17.860> wing<00:04:18.160> as<00:04:18.430> a

00:04:18.479 --> 00:04:18.489 
2013 model they switched this wing as a

00:04:18.489 --> 00:04:20.580 
2013 model they switched this wing as a
separate<00:04:19.120> this<00:04:19.450> wing<00:04:19.750> was<00:04:19.930> a<00:04:19.959> separate<00:04:20.350> piece

00:04:20.580 --> 00:04:20.590 
separate this wing was a separate piece

00:04:20.590 --> 00:04:24.060 
separate this wing was a separate piece
then<00:04:21.100> they<00:04:22.030> molded<00:04:22.540> it<00:04:22.660> into<00:04:23.200> the<00:04:23.290> body<00:04:23.500> like

00:04:24.060 --> 00:04:24.070 
then they molded it into the body like

00:04:24.070 --> 00:04:32.610 
then they molded it into the body like
this<00:04:24.370> and<00:04:26.640> as<00:04:27.640> you<00:04:27.790> can<00:04:27.910> see<00:04:29.760> the<00:04:31.620> separate

00:04:32.610 --> 00:04:32.620 
this and as you can see the separate

00:04:32.620 --> 00:04:35.490 
this and as you can see the separate
wing<00:04:32.920> piece<00:04:33.430> is<00:04:33.760> much<00:04:34.480> bigger<00:04:34.930> than<00:04:35.350> the

00:04:35.490 --> 00:04:35.500 
wing piece is much bigger than the

00:04:35.500 --> 00:04:38.970 
wing piece is much bigger than the
molding<00:04:35.890> in<00:04:36.540> peace<00:04:37.540> and<00:04:37.930> another<00:04:38.650> thing

00:04:38.970 --> 00:04:38.980 
molding in peace and another thing

00:04:38.980 --> 00:04:42.680 
molding in peace and another thing
you'll<00:04:39.220> notice<00:04:39.400> is<00:04:39.670> on<00:04:39.940> the<00:04:40.090> base<00:04:40.830> in<00:04:41.830> between

00:06:01.210 --> 00:06:04.340 
on the 2013 North hammer there's still
that<00:06:01.419> let's<00:06:01.930> signature<00:06:02.560> little<00:06:02.860> thing

00:06:04.340 --> 00:06:04.350 
that let's signature little thing

00:06:04.350 --> 00:06:06.540 
that let's signature little thing
different<00:06:05.350> a<00:06:05.560> little<00:06:06.040> bit<00:06:06.160> of<00:06:06.250> different

00:06:06.540 --> 00:06:06.550 
different a little bit of different

00:06:06.550 --> 00:06:08.879 
different a little bit of different
tempos<00:06:06.940> but

00:06:08.879 --> 00:06:08.889 
tempos but

00:06:08.889 --> 00:06:13.900 
tempos but
so<00:06:09.889> I<00:06:10.280> noticed<00:06:11.180> on<00:06:11.300> the<00:06:11.419> red<00:06:11.660> one<00:06:12.550> okay<00:06:13.550> so<00:06:13.610> the

00:06:13.900 --> 00:06:13.910 
so I noticed on the red one okay so the

00:06:13.910 --> 00:06:16.930 
so I noticed on the red one okay so the
red<00:06:14.090> one<00:06:14.270> is<00:06:14.419> just<00:06:15.020> like<00:06:15.110> a<00:06:15.230> yellow<00:06:15.530> one<00:06:15.940> but

00:06:16.930 --> 00:06:16.940 
red one is just like a yellow one but

00:06:16.940 --> 00:06:18.640 
red one is just like a yellow one but
except<00:06:17.389> for<00:06:17.419> those<00:06:17.570> differences<00:06:17.930> they

00:06:18.640 --> 00:06:18.650 
except for those differences they

00:06:18.650 --> 00:06:20.890 
except for those differences they
apparently<00:06:18.919> changed<00:06:19.639> up<00:06:19.790> the<00:06:19.820> one<00:06:20.120> but<00:06:20.690> this

00:06:20.890 --> 00:06:20.900 
apparently changed up the one but this

00:06:20.900 --> 00:06:22.960 
apparently changed up the one but this
one<00:06:21.139> it's<00:06:21.440> the<00:06:21.590> same<00:06:21.800> thing<00:06:22.160> with<00:06:22.820> different

00:06:22.960 --> 00:06:22.970 
one it's the same thing with different

00:06:22.970 --> 00:06:26.770 
one it's the same thing with different
colors<00:06:23.360> but<00:06:23.510> look<00:06:23.950> separate<00:06:24.950> piece<00:06:25.100> wing<00:06:25.780> mold

00:06:26.770 --> 00:06:26.780 
colors but look separate piece wing mold

00:06:26.780 --> 00:06:30.700 
colors but look separate piece wing mold
it<00:06:26.930> in<00:06:27.050> wing<00:06:27.669> so<00:06:28.669> I<00:06:29.380> believe<00:06:30.380> that<00:06:30.410> so<00:06:30.590> they

00:06:30.700 --> 00:06:30.710 
it in wing so I believe that so they

00:06:30.710 --> 00:06:33.460 
it in wing so I believe that so they
must<00:06:31.220> have<00:06:31.280> changed<00:06:31.639> to<00:06:31.940> that<00:06:32.139> so<00:06:33.139> that<00:06:33.169> I

00:06:33.460 --> 00:06:33.470 
must have changed to that so that I

00:06:33.470 --> 00:06:34.990 
must have changed to that so that I
think<00:06:33.800> I'm<00:06:33.889> pretty<00:06:34.070> sure<00:06:34.250> this<00:06:34.370> is<00:06:34.430> the<00:06:34.610> 2012

00:06:34.990 --> 00:06:35.000 
think I'm pretty sure this is the 2012

00:06:35.000 --> 00:06:36.730 
think I'm pretty sure this is the 2012
because<00:06:35.450> these<00:06:35.660> were<00:06:35.870> made<00:06:36.080> in<00:06:36.110> the<00:06:36.290> same<00:06:36.500> year

00:06:36.730 --> 00:06:36.740 
because these were made in the same year

00:06:36.740 --> 00:06:40.110 
because these were made in the same year
so<00:06:36.770> yeah<00:06:37.100> that's<00:06:37.400> definitely<00:06:37.520> 2012<00:06:38.740> and<00:06:39.740> uh

00:06:40.110 --> 00:06:40.120 
so yeah that's definitely 2012 and uh

00:06:40.120 --> 00:06:48.490 
so yeah that's definitely 2012 and uh
this<00:06:41.120> one<00:06:41.330> has<00:06:41.510> a<00:06:41.540> base<00:06:41.780> coat<00:06:42.080> of<00:06:42.139> a<00:06:44.050> 13<00:06:47.500> this
