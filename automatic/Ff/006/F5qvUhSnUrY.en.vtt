to use my markers and using the markers

00:01:46.710 --> 00:01:48.590 
to use my markers and using the markers
it's<00:01:46.860> pretty<00:01:47.070> quick<00:01:47.280> on<00:01:47.399> this<00:01:47.610> if<00:01:47.880> you<00:01:48.240> use<00:01:48.450> the

00:01:48.590 --> 00:01:48.600 
it's pretty quick on this if you use the

00:01:48.600 --> 00:01:53.120 
it's pretty quick on this if you use the
blender<00:01:48.899> pen<00:01:48.930> in<00:01:49.259> the<00:01:49.439> the<00:01:50.130> inks<00:01:50.759> ink<00:01:51.180> pads<00:01:52.130> it

blender pen in the the inks ink pads it

00:01:53.130 --> 00:01:54.440 
blender pen in the the inks ink pads it
does<00:01:53.399> take<00:01:53.700> a<00:01:53.729> little<00:01:53.880> bit<00:01:54.030> longer

00:01:54.440 --> 00:01:54.450 
does take a little bit longer

00:01:54.450 --> 00:01:57.109 
does take a little bit longer
and<00:01:54.659> your<00:01:55.170> image<00:01:55.590> tends<00:01:55.920> to<00:01:56.189> be<00:01:56.369> a<00:01:56.549> bit<00:01:56.850> lighter

00:01:57.109 --> 00:01:57.119 
and your image tends to be a bit lighter

00:01:57.119 --> 00:02:00.649 
and your image tends to be a bit lighter
but<00:01:57.450> it<00:01:57.509> still<00:01:57.930> is<00:01:58.229> very<00:01:58.670> beautiful<00:01:59.670> so<00:02:00.509> if<00:02:00.570> you

00:02:00.649 --> 00:02:00.659 
but it still is very beautiful so if you

00:02:00.659 --> 00:02:02.480 
but it still is very beautiful so if you
don't<00:02:00.840> have<00:02:01.020> markers<00:02:01.500> that<00:02:01.829> is<00:02:01.979> a<00:02:02.009> great<00:02:02.340> way

00:02:02.480 --> 00:02:02.490 
don't have markers that is a great way

00:02:02.490 --> 00:02:04.760 
don't have markers that is a great way
to<00:02:02.520> do<00:02:02.790> that<00:02:03.030> now<00:02:03.869> that<00:02:04.049> I<00:02:04.110> finished<00:02:04.469> coloring
