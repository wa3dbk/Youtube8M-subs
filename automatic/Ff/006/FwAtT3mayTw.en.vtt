lights it's pretty awesome yeah it is it
might<00:02:27.350> seem<00:02:27.680> that<00:02:27.739> it's<00:02:28.130> also<00:02:28.489> easy<00:02:29.060> by

00:02:29.620 --> 00:02:29.630 
might seem that it's also easy by

00:02:29.630 --> 00:02:32.199 
might seem that it's also easy by
watching<00:02:29.870> the<00:02:30.140> play<00:02:30.350> but<00:02:31.250> it's<00:02:31.340> actually<00:02:31.790> much

00:02:32.199 --> 00:02:32.209 
watching the play but it's actually much

00:02:32.209 --> 00:02:34.810 
watching the play but it's actually much
harder<00:02:32.480> than<00:02:32.870> it<00:02:32.930> looks<00:02:33.170> the<00:02:34.100> game<00:02:34.310> mechanics

00:02:34.810 --> 00:02:34.820 
harder than it looks the game mechanics

00:02:34.820 --> 00:02:39.490 
harder than it looks the game mechanics
are<00:02:35.380> pretty<00:02:36.380> unusual<00:02:37.780> it's<00:02:38.780> nothing<00:02:39.080> like

00:02:39.490 --> 00:02:39.500 
are pretty unusual it's nothing like

00:02:39.500 --> 00:02:45.509 
are pretty unusual it's nothing like
super<00:02:40.070> model<00:02:40.459> whatever<00:02:41.239> you<00:02:41.450> think<00:02:42.190> it's<00:02:43.190> like

with<00:05:19.669> I<00:05:21.009> think<00:05:22.009> this<00:05:22.130> game<00:05:22.310> is<00:05:22.370> part<00:05:22.789> old<00:05:23.060> for

00:05:23.379 --> 00:05:23.389 
with I think this game is part old for

00:05:23.389 --> 00:05:25.659 
with I think this game is part old for
the<00:05:23.479> games<00:05:23.509> for<00:05:24.139> example<00:05:24.620> in<00:05:25.039> this<00:05:25.310> game<00:05:25.520> you

00:05:25.659 --> 00:05:25.669 
the games for example in this game you

00:05:25.669 --> 00:05:28.840 
the games for example in this game you
can<00:05:25.880> see<00:05:26.120> plants<00:05:26.990> that<00:05:27.470> can<00:05:27.650> eat<00:05:27.830> you<00:05:28.009> just

00:05:28.840 --> 00:05:28.850 
can see plants that can eat you just

00:05:28.850 --> 00:05:32.350 
can see plants that can eat you just
like<00:05:29.030> a<00:05:29.060> supermodel<00:05:29.740> so<00:05:30.740> you<00:05:31.729> can<00:05:31.940> see<00:05:32.150> some

00:05:32.350 --> 00:05:32.360 
like a supermodel so you can see some

00:05:32.360 --> 00:05:35.820 
like a supermodel so you can see some
resemblance<00:05:32.979> not<00:05:33.979> to<00:05:34.130> mention<00:05:34.310> the<00:05:34.580> jumping

00:05:35.820 --> 00:05:35.830 
resemblance not to mention the jumping

00:05:35.830 --> 00:05:38.409 
resemblance not to mention the jumping
maybe<00:05:36.830> this<00:05:37.039> game<00:05:37.220> inspired<00:05:37.460> supermodel<00:05:38.240> at

00:05:38.409 --> 00:05:38.419 
maybe this game inspired supermodel at

00:05:38.419 --> 00:05:40.480 
maybe this game inspired supermodel at
some<00:05:38.449> point<00:05:38.870> maybe<00:05:39.229> it<00:05:39.440> is<00:05:39.590> birth<00:05:39.830> mother<00:05:40.190> keen

00:05:40.480 --> 00:05:40.490 
some point maybe it is birth mother keen
