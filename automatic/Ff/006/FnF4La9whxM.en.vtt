it<00:00:32.880> mixes<00:00:33.239> up<00:00:33.390> in<00:00:33.510> this<00:00:33.630> cup<00:00:33.899> I<00:00:34.140> tested<00:00:34.860> it

00:00:34.880 --> 00:00:34.890 
it mixes up in this cup I tested it

00:00:34.890 --> 00:00:36.650 
it mixes up in this cup I tested it
earlier<00:00:35.219> with<00:00:35.370> some<00:00:35.430> protein<00:00:35.880> powder<00:00:36.120> wasn't

00:00:36.650 --> 00:00:36.660 
earlier with some protein powder wasn't

00:00:36.660 --> 00:00:38.750 
earlier with some protein powder wasn't
too<00:00:36.780> impressed<00:00:36.870> without<00:00:37.530> mixed<00:00:38.010> but<00:00:38.610> i'm

00:00:38.750 --> 00:00:38.760 
too impressed without mixed but i'm

00:00:38.760 --> 00:00:40.610 
too impressed without mixed but i'm
going<00:00:38.850> to<00:00:38.940> try<00:00:39.090> something<00:00:39.420> that's<00:00:40.110> not<00:00:40.320> quite

00:00:40.610 --> 00:00:40.620 
going to try something that's not quite

00:00:40.620 --> 00:00:43.670 
going to try something that's not quite
as<00:00:40.829> big<00:00:41.219> chunky<00:00:42.120> so<00:00:42.570> it's<00:00:43.290> going<00:00:43.410> to<00:00:43.500> throw

00:00:43.670 --> 00:00:43.680 
as big chunky so it's going to throw

00:00:43.680 --> 00:00:49.729 
as big chunky so it's going to throw
some<00:00:43.860> water<00:00:44.010> in<00:00:44.280> here<00:00:48.530> and<00:00:49.530> on<00:00:49.710> the

00:00:49.729 --> 00:00:49.739 
some water in here and on the

00:00:49.739 --> 00:00:52.700 
some water in here and on the
instructions<00:00:50.460> it<00:00:50.820> basically<00:00:51.469> tells<00:00:52.469> you<00:00:52.620> to

00:00:52.700 --> 00:00:52.710 
instructions it basically tells you to

00:00:52.710 --> 00:00:55.869 
instructions it basically tells you to
fill<00:00:53.399> it<00:00:53.520> with<00:00:53.670> the<00:00:53.760> liquid<00:00:53.940> first<00:00:54.420> and<00:00:54.800> then

00:00:55.869 --> 00:00:55.879 
fill it with the liquid first and then

00:00:55.879 --> 00:01:00.740 
fill it with the liquid first and then
start<00:00:56.930> the<00:00:57.930> mixer<00:00:58.289> so<00:00:59.219> I<00:00:59.460> got<00:00:59.670> that<00:00:59.699> going<00:00:59.879> it

00:01:00.740 --> 00:01:00.750 
start the mixer so I got that going it

00:01:00.750 --> 00:01:07.500 
start the mixer so I got that going it
actually<00:01:00.960> does<00:01:01.320> seem<00:01:01.590> to<00:01:01.680> mix<00:01:01.859> it<00:01:02.010> quite<00:01:02.250> well

00:01:07.500 --> 00:01:07.510 

00:01:07.510 --> 00:01:10.490 

I'm<00:01:07.690> going<00:01:07.870> to<00:01:07.960> take<00:01:08.170> one<00:01:08.470> scoop<00:01:09.130> of<00:01:09.400> powder

00:01:10.490 --> 00:01:10.500 
I'm going to take one scoop of powder

00:01:10.500 --> 00:01:13.660 
I'm going to take one scoop of powder
and<00:01:11.500> drop<00:01:11.680> it<00:01:11.860> in<00:01:11.980> there

00:01:13.660 --> 00:01:13.670 
and drop it in there

00:01:13.670 --> 00:01:16.330 
and drop it in there
can<00:01:14.570> do<00:01:14.689> kind<00:01:14.930> of<00:01:14.990> gradually<00:01:15.229> because<00:01:15.830> it

00:01:16.330 --> 00:01:16.340 
can do kind of gradually because it

00:01:16.340 --> 00:01:18.460 
can do kind of gradually because it
makes<00:01:16.520> sense<00:01:16.820> that<00:01:17.030> it<00:01:17.479> probably<00:01:17.689> pull<00:01:18.259> a<00:01:18.290> lot

00:01:18.460 --> 00:01:18.470 
makes sense that it probably pull a lot

00:01:18.470 --> 00:01:20.289 
makes sense that it probably pull a lot
better<00:01:18.680> that<00:01:18.920> way<00:01:19.070> it's<00:01:19.759> in<00:01:19.880> them<00:01:20.000> all<00:01:20.119> at<00:01:20.240> the

00:01:20.289 --> 00:01:20.299 
better that way it's in them all at the

00:01:20.299 --> 00:01:34.960 
better that way it's in them all at the
same<00:01:20.479> time<00:01:24.790> so<00:01:25.790> now<00:01:25.880> it's<00:01:26.030> all<00:01:26.149> in<00:01:26.330> there

00:01:34.960 --> 00:01:34.970 

00:01:34.970 --> 00:01:37.360 

I'll<00:01:35.420> mention<00:01:35.780> now<00:01:36.170> and<00:01:36.890> this<00:01:37.040> is<00:01:37.220> not

00:01:37.360 --> 00:01:37.370 
I'll mention now and this is not

00:01:37.370 --> 00:01:39.670 
I'll mention now and this is not
necessary<00:01:38.000> just<00:01:38.330> a<00:01:38.900> shaker<00:01:39.170> cup<00:01:39.440> works

00:01:39.670 --> 00:01:39.680 
necessary just a shaker cup works

00:01:39.680 --> 00:01:44.050 
necessary just a shaker cup works
awesome<00:01:40.660> but<00:01:41.660> since<00:01:42.620> they<00:01:42.770> send<00:01:43.010> it<00:01:43.190> I<00:01:43.400> figured

00:01:44.050 --> 00:01:44.060 
awesome but since they send it I figured

00:01:44.060 --> 00:01:45.520 
awesome but since they send it I figured
I'd<00:01:44.180> try<00:01:44.390> it<00:01:44.450> out<00:01:44.600> let<00:01:44.900> you<00:01:45.020> guys<00:01:45.170> know<00:01:45.350> how<00:01:45.470> it

00:01:45.520 --> 00:01:45.530 
I'd try it out let you guys know how it

00:01:45.530 --> 00:02:03.280 
I'd try it out let you guys know how it
works<00:01:51.700> all<00:01:52.700> right<00:01:56.020> pour<00:01:57.020> it<00:01:57.110> in<00:01:57.200> here

00:02:03.280 --> 00:02:03.290 

00:02:03.290 --> 00:02:05.920 

all<00:02:03.830> right<00:02:04.010> well<00:02:04.280> there's<00:02:04.970> no<00:02:05.300> chunks<00:02:05.660> at<00:02:05.780> all

00:02:05.920 --> 00:02:05.930 
all right well there's no chunks at all

00:02:05.930 --> 00:02:09.400 
all right well there's no chunks at all
seem<00:02:06.620> to<00:02:06.650> mix<00:02:06.860> it<00:02:07.010> pretty<00:02:07.250> good<00:02:07.430> I<00:02:07.930> guess<00:02:08.930> if

00:02:09.400 --> 00:02:09.410 
seem to mix it pretty good I guess if

00:02:09.410 --> 00:02:13.480 
seem to mix it pretty good I guess if
that's<00:02:09.649> a<00:02:11.380> what<00:02:12.380> you<00:02:12.530> need<00:02:12.710> to<00:02:12.830> fix<00:02:12.950> your<00:02:13.100> stuff

00:02:13.480 --> 00:02:13.490 
that's a what you need to fix your stuff

00:02:13.490 --> 00:02:19.060 
that's a what you need to fix your stuff
whatever<00:02:15.430> seemed<00:02:16.430> to<00:02:16.580> work<00:02:16.670> all<00:02:16.880> right
