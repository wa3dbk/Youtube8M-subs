let<00:00:58.550> us<00:00:58.700> see<00:00:59.710> how<00:01:00.710> the<00:01:00.770> bebop<00:01:01.250> flies<00:01:01.700> a<00:01:02.950> little

let us see how the bebop flies a little
light<00:01:04.100> on<00:01:04.129> the<00:01:04.280> subject

00:01:05.609 --> 00:01:05.619 
light on the subject

00:01:05.619 --> 00:01:12.760 
light on the subject
also<00:01:06.619> these<00:01:06.830> are<00:01:08.950> well<00:01:09.950> above<00:01:11.409> you<00:01:12.409> know<00:01:12.530> what

00:01:12.760 --> 00:01:12.770 
also these are well above you know what

00:01:12.770 --> 00:01:13.900 
also these are well above you know what
I<00:01:12.800> would<00:01:13.010> consider<00:01:13.130> maybe<00:01:13.610> causing

00:01:13.900 --> 00:01:13.910 
I would consider maybe causing

00:01:13.910 --> 00:01:24.270 
I would consider maybe causing
turbulence<00:01:14.270> to<00:01:14.810> the<00:01:14.979> props<00:01:21.400> if<00:01:22.400> he<00:01:22.670> is<00:01:22.820> flying

00:01:24.270 --> 00:01:24.280 
turbulence to the props if he is flying

00:01:24.280 --> 00:01:28.350 
turbulence to the props if he is flying
and<00:01:25.280> I<00:01:25.460> definitely<00:01:26.000> can<00:01:26.240> see<00:01:26.270> it<00:01:26.659> better

00:01:28.350 --> 00:01:28.360 
and I definitely can see it better

00:01:28.360 --> 00:01:36.110 
and I definitely can see it better
there's<00:01:29.360> no<00:01:29.570> doubt

00:01:36.110 --> 00:01:36.120 

00:01:36.120 --> 00:01:49.850 

that<00:01:36.270> it's<00:01:36.690> better

00:01:49.850 --> 00:01:49.860 

00:01:49.860 --> 00:01:58.050 

if<00:01:50.860> it<00:01:51.010> is<00:01:51.100> not<00:01:51.340> easy

00:01:58.050 --> 00:01:58.060 

00:01:58.060 --> 00:02:12.020 

filming<00:01:58.810> this<00:01:58.990> way<00:02:00.060> but<00:02:02.190> it<00:02:03.190> does<00:02:03.430> seem<00:02:03.820> to<00:02:04.000> be

00:02:12.020 --> 00:02:12.030 

00:02:12.030 --> 00:02:20.640 

does<00:02:13.030> seem<00:02:13.330> to<00:02:13.450> be<00:02:13.510> holding<00:02:13.840> better<00:02:17.489> and<00:02:19.380> I<00:02:20.380> can

00:02:20.640 --> 00:02:20.650 
does seem to be holding better and I can

00:02:20.650 --> 00:02:49.990 
does seem to be holding better and I can
absolutely<00:02:21.030> see<00:02:22.030> it<00:02:22.860> at<00:02:23.860> night<00:02:24.150> better

00:02:49.990 --> 00:02:50.000 

00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:53.080 

I'm<00:02:50.600> under<00:02:50.960> it

00:02:53.080 --> 00:02:53.090 
I'm under it

00:02:53.090 --> 00:02:54.670 
I'm under it
and<00:02:53.300> she's<00:02:53.600> holding<00:02:53.780> around<00:02:54.170> she's<00:02:54.410> doing

00:02:54.670 --> 00:02:54.680 
and she's holding around she's doing

00:02:54.680 --> 00:03:11.110 
and she's holding around she's doing
well<00:02:57.250> and

00:03:11.110 --> 00:03:11.120 

00:03:11.120 --> 00:03:13.490 

definitely<00:03:12.120> got<00:03:12.330> it<00:03:12.450> under<00:03:12.570> control<00:03:13.080> a<00:03:13.110> little

00:03:13.490 --> 00:03:13.500 
definitely got it under control a little

00:03:13.500 --> 00:03:31.820 
definitely got it under control a little
more

00:03:31.820 --> 00:03:31.830 

00:03:31.830 --> 00:03:35.390 

so<00:03:32.830> and<00:03:33.250> this<00:03:33.459> is<00:03:33.610> a<00:03:33.640> front<00:03:33.970> view<00:03:34.180> of<00:03:34.209> the<00:03:34.420> bird

00:03:35.390 --> 00:03:35.400 
so and this is a front view of the bird

00:03:35.400 --> 00:03:46.700 
so and this is a front view of the bird
Baby<00:03:36.400> Bop<00:03:41.459> I'm<00:03:42.459> gonna<00:03:42.640> land<00:03:42.879> it

00:03:46.700 --> 00:03:46.710 

00:03:46.710 --> 00:03:50.940 

and<00:03:47.710> there<00:03:47.920> you<00:03:48.010> go<00:03:48.570> the<00:03:49.570> night<00:03:49.870> flight<00:03:50.260> of<00:03:50.740> the

00:03:56.370 --> 00:03:56.380 
it at all it's taken me a little while

00:03:56.380 --> 00:03:59.100 
it at all it's taken me a little while
to<00:03:56.440> learn<00:03:57.370> control<00:03:57.760> of<00:03:58.030> this<00:03:58.150> thing<00:03:58.210> at<00:03:58.750> night

00:03:59.100 --> 00:03:59.110 
to learn control of this thing at night

00:03:59.110 --> 00:04:01.980 
to learn control of this thing at night
in<00:03:59.440> the<00:03:59.530> dark<00:03:59.850> but<00:04:00.850> I<00:04:00.910> am<00:04:01.060> determined<00:04:01.660> to<00:04:01.690> see

00:04:01.980 --> 00:04:01.990 
in the dark but I am determined to see

00:04:01.990 --> 00:04:04.260 
in the dark but I am determined to see
what<00:04:02.290> happens<00:04:02.740> and<00:04:03.100> then<00:04:03.160> work<00:04:03.760> on<00:04:03.970> video

00:04:04.260 --> 00:04:04.270 
what happens and then work on video

00:04:04.270 --> 00:04:06.900 
what happens and then work on video
afterwards<00:04:04.710> so<00:04:05.710> there<00:04:05.860> you<00:04:05.920> go<00:04:06.070> made<00:04:06.580> a<00:04:06.610> night

00:04:06.900 --> 00:04:06.910 
afterwards so there you go made a night

00:04:06.910 --> 00:04:10.380 
afterwards so there you go made a night
flight<00:04:07.110> with<00:04:08.110> lights
