a<00:00:39.030> little<00:00:39.270> bit<00:00:39.360> more<00:00:39.510> full<00:00:39.809> and<00:00:40.940> that<00:00:41.940> I<00:00:41.969> don't

00:00:42.200 --> 00:00:42.210 
a little bit more full and that I don't

00:00:42.210 --> 00:00:44.030 
a little bit more full and that I don't
have<00:00:42.390> to<00:00:42.540> separate<00:00:43.020> the<00:00:43.200> layers<00:00:43.379> to<00:00:43.770> count

00:00:44.030 --> 00:00:44.040 
have to separate the layers to count

00:00:44.040 --> 00:00:45.740 
have to separate the layers to count
them<00:00:44.250> up<00:00:44.340> and<00:00:44.520> so<00:00:44.789> it<00:00:44.910> gives<00:00:45.059> it<00:00:45.239> a<00:00:45.329> nice<00:00:45.480> or

00:00:45.740 --> 00:00:45.750 
them up and so it gives it a nice or

00:00:45.750 --> 00:00:48.830 
them up and so it gives it a nice or
easier<00:00:46.079> working<00:00:46.520> for<00:00:47.520> folding<00:00:47.850> a<00:00:48.059> first<00:00:48.690> thing

00:00:48.830 --> 00:00:48.840

00:03:27.350 --> 00:03:27.360 
alternating sides okay so basically I

00:03:27.360 --> 00:03:29.270 
alternating sides okay so basically I
just<00:03:27.570> hold<00:03:27.750> it<00:03:27.900> in<00:03:28.020> the<00:03:28.140> middle<00:03:28.260> and<00:03:28.590> then

the<00:03:43.530> other<00:03:43.620> side<00:03:54.860> so<00:03:55.860> now<00:03:56.040> that<00:03:56.100> we've<00:03:56.430> found

00:03:56.630 --> 00:03:56.640 
the other side so now that we've found

00:03:56.640 --> 00:03:58.670 
the other side so now that we've found
one<00:03:57.000> on<00:03:57.120> each<00:03:57.300> side<00:03:57.330> we're<00:03:58.290> going<00:03:58.380> to<00:03:58.440> keep

00:03:58.670 --> 00:03:58.680 
one on each side we're going to keep

00:03:58.680 --> 00:04:07.960
