00:00:21.010 --> 00:00:24.820 

so<00:00:22.010> we<00:00:22.269> respond<00:00:23.269> earlier<00:00:23.480> very<00:00:24.050> simple<00:00:24.590> way<00:00:24.800> to

00:00:24.820 --> 00:00:24.830 
so we respond earlier very simple way to

00:00:24.830 --> 00:00:32.770 
so we respond earlier very simple way to
Memphis<00:00:25.550> is<00:00:25.760> the<00:00:25.910> body<00:00:31.390> this<00:00:32.390> is<00:00:32.540> not<00:00:32.720> my

00:00:32.770 --> 00:00:32.780 
Memphis is the body this is not my

00:00:32.780 --> 00:00:34.299 
Memphis is the body this is not my
latest<00:00:33.379> remind<00:00:33.739> you<00:00:33.800> this<00:00:33.890> is<00:00:33.949> not<00:00:34.250> our

00:00:34.299 --> 00:00:34.309 
latest remind you this is not our

00:00:34.309 --> 00:00:36.490 
latest remind you this is not our
research<00:00:34.940> I<00:00:35.089> just<00:00:35.360> I<00:00:35.449> just<00:00:35.480> have<00:00:35.809> to<00:00:35.960> play<00:00:36.199> kind

00:00:36.490 --> 00:00:36.500 
research I just I just have to play kind

00:00:36.500 --> 00:00:38.920 
research I just I just have to play kind
of<00:00:36.589> a<00:00:36.790> foundation<00:00:37.790> so<00:00:38.269> you<00:00:38.330> can<00:00:38.479> see<00:00:38.629> what<00:00:38.780> we

00:00:38.920 --> 00:00:38.930 
of a foundation so you can see what we

00:00:38.930 --> 00:00:41.799 
of a foundation so you can see what we
were<00:00:39.019> building<00:00:39.199> on<00:00:39.530> in<00:00:39.830> the<00:00:39.949> research<00:00:40.570> so<00:00:41.570> from

00:00:41.799 --> 00:00:41.809 
were building on in the research so from

00:00:41.809 --> 00:00:44.439 
were building on in the research so from
here<00:00:41.989> what<00:00:42.170> happens<00:00:42.979> in<00:00:43.159> in<00:00:43.489> the<00:00:43.940> chain<00:00:44.299> is

00:00:44.439 --> 00:00:44.449 
here what happens in in the chain is

00:00:44.449 --> 00:00:45.640 
here what happens in in the chain is
that<00:00:44.600> they<00:00:44.690> say<00:00:44.750> Oh<00:00:44.839> condition<00:00:45.229> the<00:00:45.290> basic

00:00:45.640 --> 00:00:45.650 
that they say Oh condition the basic

00:00:45.650 --> 00:00:47.079 
that they say Oh condition the basic
opposites<00:00:46.129> but<00:00:46.220> we<00:00:46.430> can<00:00:46.549> search<00:00:46.729> the<00:00:46.850> letter

00:00:47.079 --> 00:00:47.089 
opposites but we can search the letter

00:00:47.089 --> 00:00:49.000 
opposites but we can search the letter
that<00:00:47.210> and<00:00:47.720> we<00:00:47.930> can<00:00:48.080> look<00:00:48.170> at<00:00:48.290> the<00:00:48.440> end<00:00:48.739> that<00:00:48.860> is

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:49.010 
that and we can look at the end that is

00:00:49.010 --> 00:00:51.399 
that and we can look at the end that is
within<00:00:49.250> the<00:00:49.519> yin<00:00:49.729> and<00:00:49.970> the<00:00:50.059> yang<00:00:50.510> knows<00:00:50.900> that

00:00:51.399 --> 00:00:51.409 
within the yin and the yang knows that

00:00:51.409 --> 00:00:53.530 
within the yin and the yang knows that
is<00:00:51.530> when<00:00:51.710> they<00:00:51.830> begin<00:00:52.190> so<00:00:52.909> if<00:00:52.970> we<00:00:53.030> can<00:00:53.239> show<00:00:53.390> the

00:00:53.530 --> 00:00:53.540 
is when they begin so if we can show the

00:00:53.540 --> 00:00:57.460 
is when they begin so if we can show the
offices<00:00:55.119> what<00:00:56.119> we<00:00:56.269> have<00:00:56.449> here<00:00:56.750> is<00:00:56.780> first<00:00:57.320> to

00:00:57.460 --> 00:00:57.470 
offices what we have here is first to

00:00:57.470 --> 00:00:59.859 
offices what we have here is first to
our<00:00:57.619> two<00:00:57.979> offices<00:00:58.519> these<00:00:59.089> two<00:00:59.330> opposites<00:00:59.720> are

00:00:59.859 --> 00:00:59.869 
our two offices these two opposites are

00:00:59.869 --> 00:01:19.899 
our two offices these two opposites are
here

00:01:19.899 --> 00:01:19.909 

00:01:19.909 --> 00:01:33.240 

or<00:01:20.909> we<00:01:21.330> take<00:01:21.570> less<00:01:21.900> at<00:01:22.170> last

00:01:33.240 --> 00:01:33.250 

00:01:33.250 --> 00:01:48.610 

Oh

00:01:48.610 --> 00:01:48.620 

00:01:48.620 --> 00:01:50.440 

so<00:01:49.130> this<00:01:49.280> one<00:01:49.460> spell<00:01:49.700> us<00:01:49.820> quite<00:01:50.120> a<00:01:50.150> lot<00:01:50.360> of

00:01:50.440 --> 00:01:50.450 
so this one spell us quite a lot of

00:01:50.450 --> 00:01:52.630 
so this one spell us quite a lot of
energy<00:01:50.570> oh<00:01:50.990> it's<00:01:51.200> really<00:01:51.380> gallery<00:01:51.950> and

00:01:52.630 --> 00:01:52.640 
energy oh it's really gallery and

00:01:52.640 --> 00:01:55.000 
energy oh it's really gallery and
forming<00:01:53.060> a<00:01:53.120> connection<00:01:53.630> alarm<00:01:53.930> and<00:01:54.380> here<00:01:54.890> this

00:01:55.000 --> 00:01:55.010 
forming a connection alarm and here this

00:01:55.010 --> 00:01:56.800 
forming a connection alarm and here this
is<00:01:55.160> much<00:01:55.340> lighter<00:01:55.610> and<00:01:55.820> cleaner<00:01:56.030> it's

00:01:56.800 --> 00:01:56.810 
is much lighter and cleaner it's

00:01:56.810 --> 00:01:58.660 
is much lighter and cleaner it's
separated<00:01:57.410> it's<00:01:57.740> creating<00:01:58.040> a<00:01:58.100> clear<00:01:58.370> kind<00:01:58.610> of

00:01:58.660 --> 00:01:58.670 
separated it's creating a clear kind of

00:01:58.670 --> 00:02:02.290 
separated it's creating a clear kind of
the<00:01:58.730> boundary<00:01:59.150> of<00:01:59.180> the<00:01:59.360> station<00:02:01.060> and<00:02:02.060> then<00:02:02.240> we

00:02:02.290 --> 00:02:02.300 
the boundary of the station and then we

00:02:02.300 --> 00:02:10.180 
the boundary of the station and then we
have<00:02:02.390> the<00:02:02.510> last<00:02:02.720> one<00:02:08.830> these<00:02:09.830> are<00:02:10.010> in<00:02:10.130> the

00:02:10.180 --> 00:02:10.190 
have the last one these are in the

00:02:10.190 --> 00:02:12.250 
have the last one these are in the
middle<00:02:10.369> so<00:02:10.640> if<00:02:10.880> you<00:02:11.000> notice<00:02:11.150> these<00:02:11.420> in<00:02:12.020> terms

00:02:12.250 --> 00:02:12.260 
middle so if you notice these in terms

00:02:12.260 --> 00:02:13.840 
middle so if you notice these in terms
of<00:02:12.320> energy<00:02:12.440> that<00:02:12.740> are<00:02:12.980> much<00:02:13.130> closer<00:02:13.430> to<00:02:13.760> each

00:02:13.840 --> 00:02:13.850 
of energy that are much closer to each

00:02:13.850 --> 00:02:17.050 
of energy that are much closer to each
other<00:02:14.770> they're<00:02:15.770> very<00:02:15.890> distinct<00:02:16.400> offices<00:02:16.880> but

00:02:17.050 --> 00:02:17.060 
other they're very distinct offices but

00:02:17.060 --> 00:02:20.530 
other they're very distinct offices but
go<00:02:17.720> back<00:02:17.870> to<00:02:18.050> the<00:02:18.110> last<00:02:18.200> one<00:02:18.470> off<00:02:18.680> the<00:02:19.540> first

00:02:20.530 --> 00:02:20.540 
go back to the last one off the first

00:02:20.540 --> 00:02:23.500 
go back to the last one off the first
one<00:02:21.370> here<00:02:22.370> this<00:02:22.490> one<00:02:22.550> is<00:02:22.730> very<00:02:23.000> easy<00:02:23.270> this

00:02:23.500 --> 00:02:23.510 
one here this one is very easy this

00:02:23.510 --> 00:02:29.080 
one here this one is very easy this
almost<00:02:23.750> no<00:02:23.960> energy<00:02:27.490> this<00:02:28.490> is<00:02:28.820> a<00:02:28.850> real

00:02:29.080 --> 00:02:29.090 
almost no energy this is a real

00:02:29.090 --> 00:02:39.660 
almost no energy this is a real
difference<00:02:29.300> in<00:02:29.630> these<00:02:29.720> type<00:02:29.960> of<00:02:29.990> the<00:02:30.230> balances

00:02:39.660 --> 00:02:39.670 

00:02:39.670 --> 00:02:43.030 

so<00:02:40.670> energy<00:02:41.269> dynamics<00:02:41.750> how<00:02:42.319> do<00:02:42.379> they<00:02:42.530> relate<00:02:42.769> it

00:02:43.030 --> 00:02:43.040 
so energy dynamics how do they relate it

00:02:43.040 --> 00:02:45.550 
so energy dynamics how do they relate it
to<00:02:43.099> the<00:02:43.400> chakras<00:02:43.700> in<00:02:43.909> here<00:02:44.329> has<00:02:44.870> relate<00:02:45.290> to<00:02:45.470> the

00:02:45.550 --> 00:02:45.560 
to the chakras in here has relate to the

00:02:45.560 --> 00:02:47.559 
to the chakras in here has relate to the
sociological<00:02:46.010> picture<00:02:46.640> out<00:02:46.760> there<00:02:46.790> so<00:02:47.480> we

00:02:47.559 --> 00:02:47.569 
sociological picture out there so we

00:02:47.569 --> 00:02:48.970 
sociological picture out there so we
decided<00:02:47.870> to<00:02:47.989> do<00:02:48.110> is<00:02:48.230> strengthen<00:02:48.470> both<00:02:48.799> of

00:02:48.970 --> 00:02:48.980 
decided to do is strengthen both of

00:02:48.980 --> 00:02:52.270 
decided to do is strengthen both of
these<00:02:49.069> things<00:02:50.230> the<00:02:51.230> shoppers<00:02:51.680> were<00:02:51.860> easier

00:02:52.270 --> 00:02:52.280 
these things the shoppers were easier

00:02:52.280 --> 00:02:54.580 
these things the shoppers were easier
just<00:02:53.060> in<00:02:53.239> the<00:02:53.299> sense<00:02:53.450> of<00:02:53.599> this<00:02:53.750> I<00:02:53.989> have<00:02:54.409> more

00:02:54.580 --> 00:02:54.590 
just in the sense of this I have more

00:02:54.590 --> 00:02:56.710 
just in the sense of this I have more
ministry<00:02:55.159> with<00:02:55.340> them<00:02:55.519> I've<00:02:56.360> been<00:02:56.510> playing

00:02:56.710 --> 00:02:56.720 
ministry with them I've been playing

00:02:56.720 --> 00:02:58.360 
ministry with them I've been playing
with<00:02:56.870> the<00:02:56.989> longer<00:02:57.319> there's<00:02:57.530> lots<00:02:58.040> of<00:02:58.159> clear

00:02:58.360 --> 00:02:58.370 
with the longer there's lots of clear

00:02:58.370 --> 00:03:01.839 
with the longer there's lots of clear
boxes<00:02:58.900> so<00:02:59.900> /<00:03:00.200> about<00:03:00.530> /<00:03:00.560> there's<00:03:01.340> a<00:03:01.430> model

00:03:01.839 --> 00:03:01.849 
boxes so / about / there's a model

00:03:01.849 --> 00:03:03.640 
boxes so / about / there's a model
called<00:03:02.060> spiral<00:03:02.299> magnetics<00:03:02.930> if<00:03:03.140> we<00:03:03.260> heard<00:03:03.500> the

00:03:03.640 --> 00:03:03.650 
called spiral magnetics if we heard the

00:03:03.650 --> 00:03:05.559 
called spiral magnetics if we heard the
name<00:03:03.829> by<00:03:04.129> now<00:03:04.370> through<00:03:04.819> the<00:03:05.090> information

00:03:05.559 --> 00:03:05.569 
name by now through the information

00:03:05.569 --> 00:03:07.809 
name by now through the information
about<00:03:05.720> the<00:03:05.900> issue<00:03:06.049> from<00:03:06.379> wherever<00:03:06.819> spiral

00:03:07.809 --> 00:03:07.819 
about the issue from wherever spiral

00:03:07.819 --> 00:03:10.449 
about the issue from wherever spiral
dynamics<00:03:08.530> was<00:03:09.530> a<00:03:09.560> theory<00:03:09.920> that<00:03:10.010> I<00:03:10.129> came<00:03:10.340> across

00:03:10.449 --> 00:03:10.459 
dynamics was a theory that I came across

00:03:10.459 --> 00:03:14.589 
dynamics was a theory that I came across
a<00:03:10.670> number<00:03:10.909> of<00:03:11.150> years<00:03:11.239> ago<00:03:11.590> it's<00:03:12.590> a<00:03:12.739> sort<00:03:13.579> of<00:03:13.609> one

00:03:14.589 --> 00:03:14.599 
a number of years ago it's a sort of one

00:03:14.599 --> 00:03:16.119 
a number of years ago it's a sort of one
of<00:03:14.750> the<00:03:14.840> growing<00:03:15.200> number<00:03:15.349> of<00:03:15.500> theories<00:03:15.920> that

00:03:16.119 --> 00:03:16.129 
of the growing number of theories that
