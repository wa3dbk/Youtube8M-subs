other foundation routine video I do have

00:00:55.199 --> 00:00:56.899 
other foundation routine video I do have
quite<00:00:55.379> a<00:00:55.440> fair<00:00:55.649> amount<00:00:55.739> of<00:00:55.859> acne<00:00:56.309> so<00:00:56.639> this

00:00:56.899 --> 00:00:56.909 
quite a fair amount of acne so this

00:00:56.909 --> 00:00:59.029 
quite a fair amount of acne so this
definitely<00:00:57.179> does<00:00:57.629> help<00:00:57.809> cover<00:00:58.139> that<00:00:58.260> and<00:00:58.710> it

00:00:59.029 --> 00:00:59.039 
definitely does help cover that and it

00:00:59.039 --> 00:01:01.610 
definitely does help cover that and it
gives<00:00:59.249> quite<00:00:59.460> a<00:00:59.519> natural<00:00:59.729> effect<00:01:00.269> as<00:01:00.569> well<00:01:00.780> so

00:01:01.610 --> 00:01:01.620 
gives quite a natural effect as well so

00:01:01.620 --> 00:01:03.889 
gives quite a natural effect as well so
I<00:01:01.649> really<00:01:02.249> like<00:01:02.429> that<00:01:02.609> and<00:01:02.909> it<00:01:03.179> is<00:01:03.329> latex<00:01:03.659> free

00:01:03.889 --> 00:01:03.899
