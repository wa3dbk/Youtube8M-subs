00:00:06.520 --> 00:00:12.820
 Click this on the list of things you want with amazon 

00:00:11.290 --> 00:00:16.900
 If you register 

00:00:12.820 --> 00:00:20.860
 It is a product that I have purchased by mistake one click, so I'm scary I'm smart 

00:00:16.900 --> 00:00:22.930
 I want to check the app app for amazon on the phone . 

00:00:20.860 --> 00:00:26.140
 I said what you want list 

00:00:22.930 --> 00:00:29.349
 I can add to the list with one tap, but this one 

00:00:26.140 --> 00:00:30.480
 If I make a mistake I understand here one-click registration 

00:00:29.349 --> 00:00:33.480
 that 

00:00:30.480 --> 00:00:36.690
 There is a thing called registration to the wish list 

00:00:33.480 --> 00:00:39.870
 That Tteyuu purchase with one click near the top by mistake 

00:00:36.690 --> 00:00:44.760
 You can buy it if you choose 

00:00:39.870 --> 00:00:49.199
 Here is the item you received this time Razer 's Klagen 7.1 channel 

00:00:44.760 --> 00:00:50.470
 There a headset connected to a surround-compatible usb 

00:00:49.199 --> 00:00:54.400
 Even if you look at the box a little 

00:00:50.470 --> 00:00:57.160
 It is a very cool package with a very kinda feeling 

00:00:54.400 --> 00:01:00.730
 It's always cool like this with a laser package 

00:00:57.160 --> 00:01:04.540
 Attach Velcro next to it 

00:01:00.730 --> 00:01:09.590
 After all it was a guy who opened up, but I'm going to put it in a slant because I'm reflected in the story 

00:01:04.540 --> 00:01:14.840
 Yes it's like this It 's hard to give out to the grandmother of the headset 

00:01:09.590 --> 00:01:16.010
 When I crawled I think it's great band when it receives it looks like Kraken 

00:01:14.840 --> 00:01:18.510
 Quite 

00:01:16.010 --> 00:01:23.430
 After all it is quite cool 

00:01:18.510 --> 00:01:24.090
 It's a bit real I'm watching once in Yodobashi, I'm looking at this, but I like it 

00:01:23.430 --> 00:01:27.310
 Cool 

00:01:24.090 --> 00:01:31.630
 I think this is the green of the cable it is nice to see you Poku Tsu laser 

00:01:27.310 --> 00:01:37.780
 The microphone of the reading headset is attached here 

00:01:31.630 --> 00:01:41.649
 Turn Shino how the usb terminal analog sound of it's tier mat model on here in 

00:01:37.780 --> 00:01:44.679
 I have a cable, but also here Kraken has become usb terminal 

00:01:41.649 --> 00:01:47.330
 Control the sound on your computer with usb 

00:01:44.679 --> 00:01:51.560
 Naga to us with surround expansion of going channel 

00:01:47.330 --> 00:01:57.470
 I would like to add a little more here and check the comfort 

00:01:51.560 --> 00:02:00.080
 After all my ears mdr 2 is using m differently and the ear and the golden 

00:01:57.470 --> 00:02:05.800
 There is a feeling of pressure from a little earpad 

00:02:00.080 --> 00:02:05.800
 Like this Yeah I have become to feel that it is firmly seated comfortably in 

00:02:06.420 --> 00:02:12.990
 Let's connect to the usb terminal for a moment 

00:02:10.170 --> 00:02:17.280
 I understand that the lamp is a point 

00:02:12.990 --> 00:02:18.840
 This it's get the green of the lamp this is kinda cool that gaming 

00:02:17.280 --> 00:02:24.030
 I feel like a headset 

00:02:18.840 --> 00:02:27.020
 Just because there is a rumor that the sound performance of the microphone is not good with a laser headset 

00:02:24.030 --> 00:02:31.850
 Only this form I think I do not use this Maiko Anma 

00:02:27.020 --> 00:02:35.360
 In fact , use the microphone of the sandblaster who is making a mess or after this 

00:02:31.850 --> 00:02:37.820
 I'm thinking of preparing a microphone like Sony if I have a chance, but this is a bit 

00:02:35.360 --> 00:02:40.160
 This of cool also, I think trying to use in decoration 

00:02:37.820 --> 00:02:45.080
 Not bad not bad at all 

00:02:40.160 --> 00:02:46.580
 This time it was a bit like this laser's headset a little bit like an opening video 

00:02:45.080 --> 00:02:51.170
 But this time after this 

00:02:46.580 --> 00:02:55.910
 To be able to control the sound with a laser application of leaving guy of Usa Try using 

00:02:51.170 --> 00:02:56.540
 I think to try actually still because to say in only a little introduction to this time 

00:02:55.910 --> 00:03:00.150
 Will be 

00:02:56.540 --> 00:03:03.870

00:03:03.870 --> 00:03:12.350

00:03:08.400 --> 00:03:14.400
