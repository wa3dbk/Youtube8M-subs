00:00:00.160 --> 00:00:02.789
 two 

00:00:05.930 --> 00:00:10.430
 the fairy presidential debate of the 

00:00:07.970 --> 00:00:12.620
 board four main themes education 

00:00:10.430 --> 00:00:14.180
 health and economy safety 

00:00:12.620 --> 00:00:16.039
 from early members of the various 

00:00:14.180 --> 00:00:17.359
 political parties met in the 

00:00:16.039 --> 00:00:19.400
 center of fairs and conventions cifco 

00:00:17.359 --> 00:00:21.160
 to be witnesses of the proposals of 

00:00:19.400 --> 00:00:23.090
 the five presidential candidates 

00:00:21.160 --> 00:00:27.530
 some of them showed up 

00:00:23.090 --> 00:00:29.600
 expectant about this debate our 

00:00:27.530 --> 00:00:33.890
 main commitments go around 

00:00:29.600 --> 00:00:37.489
 education , employment and security the 

00:00:33.890 --> 00:00:41.450
 security and employment are two 

00:00:37.489 --> 00:00:43.940
 crucial needs but for them the 

00:00:41.450 --> 00:00:47.280
 education, it is essential to improve 

00:00:43.940 --> 00:00:49.440
 educational levels of our society 

00:00:47.280 --> 00:00:51.660
 well I think this shows that there 

00:00:49.440 --> 00:00:54.180
 who respect the rules and 

00:00:51.660 --> 00:00:56.879
 agreements and there are those who do not treat it 

00:00:54.180 --> 00:00:58.860
 then to take advantage of them but 

00:00:56.879 --> 00:01:01.079
 I believe that this allows the 

00:00:58.860 --> 00:01:03.690
 Salvadorans is to see who respects 

00:01:01.079 --> 00:01:05.309
 always what has been agreed one of the 

00:01:03.690 --> 00:01:06.030
 issues that most concern the population is 

00:01:05.309 --> 00:01:07.740
 safety 

00:01:06.030 --> 00:01:09.479
 all the candidates offered 

00:01:07.740 --> 00:01:11.190
 different proposals since establishing 

00:01:09.479 --> 00:01:12.899
 curfews until you look older 

00:01:11.190 --> 00:01:14.490
 opportunities for young people not to 

00:01:12.899 --> 00:01:16.740
 fall into bad steps 

00:01:14.490 --> 00:01:20.220
 and crime prevention includes the 

00:01:16.740 --> 00:01:22.410
 execution of the plans the plan 100 and the 

00:01:20.220 --> 00:01:24.409
 safe chain plan the vision of the 

00:01:22.410 --> 00:01:27.600
 patient is to dismantle the 

00:01:24.409 --> 00:01:28.820
 settlements the proliferation and the 

00:01:27.600 --> 00:01:32.280
 influence of criminal groups 

00:01:28.820 --> 00:01:33.810
 organized or be called forces 

00:01:32.280 --> 00:01:35.550
 parallel 

00:01:33.810 --> 00:01:38.399
 who live exactly in the places 

00:01:35.550 --> 00:01:39.899
 where gangs live in places 

00:01:38.399 --> 00:01:42.659
 where there are gangs have security 

00:01:39.899 --> 00:01:45.179
 that Tony President takes out will be there 

00:01:42.659 --> 00:01:47.640
 with work with the authorities 

00:01:45.179 --> 00:01:49.830
 because I know this subject and I can 

00:01:47.640 --> 00:01:52.259
 fight we put the five in jail 

00:01:49.830 --> 00:01:53.820
 thousand gang members the most dangerous that 

00:01:52.259 --> 00:01:56.100
 integrated clicas 

00:01:53.820 --> 00:01:58.530
 not only that they are kidnappings but 

00:01:56.100 --> 00:02:01.590
 that extorted we're going to continue 

00:01:58.530 --> 00:02:04.920
 expanding we will continue to deepen and 

00:02:01.590 --> 00:02:06.510
 let's continue purging the police 

00:02:04.920 --> 00:02:09.929
 national civil 

00:02:06.510 --> 00:02:12.720
 you have to have very energetic plans very 

00:02:09.929 --> 00:02:15.660
 defined we believe that families 

00:02:12.720 --> 00:02:18.660
 Salvadorans needs to take a 

00:02:15.660 --> 00:02:22.440
 hope and to that hope we will 

00:02:18.660 --> 00:02:25.010
 We are proposing to implement the 

00:02:22.440 --> 00:02:28.200
 emergency rule or 'curfew' 

00:02:25.010 --> 00:02:31.320
 where will we implement it in those 

00:02:28.200 --> 00:02:33.810
 municipalities besieged by crime 

00:02:31.320 --> 00:02:35.700
 of those who already governed that tough 

00:02:33.810 --> 00:02:38.250
 what a super tough hand the truce and 

00:02:35.700 --> 00:02:40.140
 all those things the same Mr. Sanchez 

00:02:38.250 --> 00:02:42.900
 Ceren said that we should give 

00:02:40.140 --> 00:02:45.690
 facilities to the mareros we go 

00:02:42.900 --> 00:02:47.660
 to make use of all the powers that we 

00:02:45.690 --> 00:02:51.540
 grants the constitution of the republic 

00:02:47.660 --> 00:02:54.030
 to be able to militarize security 

00:02:51.540 --> 00:02:56.440
 public before these proposals and some 

00:02:54.030 --> 00:02:59.080
 analysts gave their opinion about it 

00:02:56.440 --> 00:03:03.220
 that will take out the military that is going to 

00:02:59.080 --> 00:03:05.190
 create criminal farms that will command in 

00:03:03.220 --> 00:03:09.040
 the different regions of the country 

00:03:05.190 --> 00:03:11.380
 demobilized soldiers and veterans of 

00:03:09.040 --> 00:03:15.610
 war obviously people feel 

00:03:11.380 --> 00:03:18.700
 sympathy but they know that person 

00:03:15.610 --> 00:03:21.490
 that he can not do that he has 

00:03:18.700 --> 00:03:24.310
 pronounced because the institutions of 

00:03:21.490 --> 00:03:27.700
 security should not militarize me 

00:03:24.310 --> 00:03:30.190
 I know what is in itself a proposal of that 

00:03:27.700 --> 00:03:32.230
 way that clashes frontally not only with 

00:03:30.190 --> 00:03:34.090
 the constitution but with resolutions 

00:03:32.230 --> 00:03:35.830
 constitutional this exercise 

00:03:34.090 --> 00:03:37.600
 democratic is a way of knowing the 

00:03:35.830 --> 00:03:38.890
 proposals of each of the candidates 

00:03:37.600 --> 00:03:41.920

00:03:38.890 --> 00:03:44.950
