say that homework obviously to them

00:01:47.590 --> 00:01:49.589 
say that homework obviously to them
because<00:01:47.679> I<00:01:47.800> box<00:01:48.009> I've<00:01:48.369> you<00:01:49.090> know<00:01:49.119> talk<00:01:49.450> to

00:01:49.589 --> 00:01:49.599 
because I box I've you know talk to

00:01:49.599 --> 00:01:51.029 
because I box I've you know talk to
those<00:01:49.690> students<00:01:50.140> and<00:01:50.289> then<00:01:50.380> they<00:01:50.739> basically

00:01:51.029 --> 00:01:51.039 
those students and then they basically

00:01:51.039 --> 00:01:52.710 
those students and then they basically
said<00:01:51.280> that<00:01:51.459> ninety<00:01:52.000> percent<00:01:52.030> of<00:01:52.390> stress

00:01:52.710 --> 00:01:52.720 
said that ninety percent of stress

00:01:52.720 --> 00:01:54.690 
said that ninety percent of stress
coming<00:01:53.200> for<00:01:53.619> coming<00:01:53.920> from<00:01:54.069> school<00:01:54.310> comes<00:01:54.520> from

00:01:54.690 --> 00:01:54.700 
coming for coming from school comes from

00:01:54.700 --> 00:01:56.790 
coming for coming from school comes from
homework<00:01:54.970> so<00:01:55.119> removing<00:01:55.750> that<00:01:55.929> factor<00:01:56.349> would

00:01:56.790 --> 00:01:56.800 
homework so removing that factor would

00:01:56.800 --> 00:01:59.850 
homework so removing that factor would
remove<00:01:57.310> stress<00:01:57.700> dramatically<00:01:58.420> making<00:01:59.080> school

00:01:59.850 --> 00:01:59.860 
remove stress dramatically making school

00:01:59.860 --> 00:02:01.710 
remove stress dramatically making school
probably<00:02:00.310> a<00:02:00.340> lot<00:02:00.520> easier<00:02:00.910> to<00:02:01.209> cope<00:02:01.390> with<00:02:01.479> at

00:02:01.710 --> 00:02:01.720 
probably a lot easier to cope with at

00:02:01.720 --> 00:02:06.089 
probably a lot easier to cope with at
least<00:02:02.310> at<00:02:03.310> least<00:02:03.340> for<00:02:03.700> most<00:02:03.819> students<00:02:04.209> and<00:02:05.099> the

00:02:06.089 --> 00:02:06.099 
least at least for most students and the

00:02:06.099 --> 00:02:09.690 
least at least for most students and the
whole<00:02:06.280> point<00:02:06.580> is<00:02:06.849> that<00:02:07.590> homework<00:02:08.590> is<00:02:08.950> a<00:02:08.979> really

00:02:09.690 --> 00:02:09.700 
whole point is that homework is a really

00:02:09.700 --> 00:02:14.760 
whole point is that homework is a really
good<00:02:09.819> factor<00:02:10.270> to<00:02:10.750> help<00:02:10.929> anyone<00:02:11.550> but<00:02:13.410> at<00:02:14.410> home

00:02:14.760 --> 00:02:14.770 
good factor to help anyone but at home

00:02:14.770 --> 00:02:17.450 
good factor to help anyone but at home
you<00:02:15.160> know<00:02:15.550> homes<00:02:15.850> a<00:02:16.060> lot<00:02:16.240> is<00:02:16.390> a<00:02:16.450> lot<00:02:17.050> different

00:02:17.450 --> 00:02:17.460 
you know homes a lot is a lot different

00:02:17.460 --> 00:02:20.370 
you know homes a lot is a lot different
to<00:02:18.460> an<00:02:18.700> exam<00:02:19.210> environment<00:02:19.690> like

00:02:20.370 --> 00:02:20.380 
to an exam environment like

00:02:20.380 --> 00:02:22.740 
to an exam environment like
a home<00:02:20.620> environment<00:02:20.920> your<00:02:21.820> TV<00:02:22.150> got<00:02:22.300> your<00:02:22.420> xbox

a home environment your TV got your xbox

00:02:22.750 --> 00:02:24.510 
a home environment your TV got your xbox
you<00:02:22.870> basically<00:02:23.110> got<00:02:23.230> distractions<00:02:23.800> you<00:02:23.860> you

00:02:24.510 --> 00:02:24.520 
you basically got distractions you you

00:02:24.520 --> 00:02:29.250 
you basically got distractions you you

00:02:31.320 --> 00:02:31.330 
lack of discipline because you can

00:02:31.330 --> 00:02:34.410 
lack of discipline because you can

wherever and there is always that factor
that<00:02:57.310> home<00:02:57.670> isn't<00:02:57.940> really<00:02:58.800> you<00:02:59.800> know<00:02:59.950> cuz<00:03:00.130> you

00:03:00.240 --> 00:03:00.250 
that home isn't really you know cuz you

00:03:00.250 --> 00:03:01.830 
that home isn't really you know cuz you
can<00:03:00.580> get<00:03:00.700> yourself<00:03:00.790> really<00:03:01.180> comfortable<00:03:01.690> for

00:03:01.830 --> 00:03:01.840 
can get yourself really comfortable for

00:03:01.840 --> 00:03:05.070 
can get yourself really comfortable for
an<00:03:01.930> exam<00:03:02.760> where<00:03:03.760> is<00:03:03.910> in<00:03:04.060> an<00:03:04.210> exam<00:03:04.600> it<00:03:04.750> might<00:03:04.900> be

00:03:05.070 --> 00:03:05.080 
an exam where is in an exam it might be

00:03:05.080 --> 00:03:08.220 
an exam where is in an exam it might be
less<00:03:05.350> less<00:03:06.100> comfortable<00:03:06.630> so<00:03:07.630> there<00:03:08.050> is<00:03:08.080> that

00:03:08.220 --> 00:03:08.230 
less less comfortable so there is that

00:03:08.230 --> 00:03:13.170 
less less comfortable so there is that
sort<00:03:08.650> of<00:03:08.860> notion<00:03:09.820> we're<00:03:11.190> working<00:03:12.190> at<00:03:12.340> how<00:03:12.520> you

00:03:13.170 --> 00:03:13.180 
sort of notion we're working at how you

00:03:13.180 --> 00:03:15.060 
sort of notion we're working at how you
know<00:03:13.270> working<00:03:13.510> at<00:03:13.810> home<00:03:13.990> for<00:03:14.380> an<00:03:14.530> exam<00:03:14.860> at

00:03:15.060 --> 00:03:15.070 
know working at home for an exam at

00:03:15.070 --> 00:03:17.850 
know working at home for an exam at
school<00:03:15.720> it<00:03:16.720> doesn't<00:03:17.170> really<00:03:17.290> help<00:03:17.590> especially

00:03:17.850 --> 00:03:17.860 
school it doesn't really help especially

00:03:17.860 --> 00:03:19.500 
school it doesn't really help especially
with<00:03:18.100> the<00:03:18.310> content<00:03:18.760> dependent<00:03:19.240> queue<00:03:19.390> which

00:03:19.500 --> 00:03:19.510 
with the content dependent queue which

00:03:19.510 --> 00:03:21.480 
with the content dependent queue which
means<00:03:19.750> you<00:03:20.380> you're<00:03:20.620> more<00:03:20.800> likely<00:03:21.040> to<00:03:21.310> remember

00:03:21.480 --> 00:03:21.490 
means you you're more likely to remember

00:03:21.490 --> 00:03:23.820 
means you you're more likely to remember
something<00:03:21.820> if<00:03:22.810> you<00:03:22.960> remember<00:03:23.290> the<00:03:23.380> content

00:03:23.820 --> 00:03:23.830 
something if you remember the content

00:03:23.830 --> 00:03:26.610 
something if you remember the content
around<00:03:24.820> you<00:03:25.090> so<00:03:25.570> working<00:03:26.020> at<00:03:26.230> home<00:03:26.410> doesn't

00:03:26.610 --> 00:03:26.620 
around you so working at home doesn't

00:03:26.620 --> 00:03:30.500 
around you so working at home doesn't
really<00:03:26.860> fit<00:03:27.100> that<00:03:27.280> that<00:03:28.110> specific<00:03:29.110> place<00:03:29.530> but

00:03:30.500 --> 00:03:30.510 
really fit that that specific place but

00:03:30.510 --> 00:03:32.820 
really fit that that specific place but
with<00:03:31.510> this<00:03:31.810> in<00:03:32.080> mind<00:03:32.110> I<00:03:32.380> won't<00:03:32.560> actually<00:03:32.650> move

00:03:32.820 --> 00:03:32.830 
with this in mind I won't actually move

00:03:32.830 --> 00:03:34.710 
with this in mind I won't actually move
on<00:03:33.100> to<00:03:33.250> the<00:03:33.310> people<00:03:33.580> who<00:03:33.640> think<00:03:34.150> that<00:03:34.270> how<00:03:34.510> much

00:03:34.710 --> 00:03:34.720 
on to the people who think that how much

00:03:34.720 --> 00:03:38.070 
on to the people who think that how much
should<00:03:34.930> be<00:03:35.730> you<00:03:36.730> you<00:03:37.420> know<00:03:37.510> for<00:03:37.540> the<00:03:37.780> people

00:03:38.070 --> 00:03:38.080 
should be you you know for the people

00:03:38.080 --> 00:03:40.470 
should be you you know for the people
who<00:03:38.110> support<00:03:38.530> homework<00:03:38.890> and<00:03:39.100> that<00:03:39.850> is<00:03:40.000> simply

00:03:40.470 --> 00:03:40.480 
who support homework and that is simply

00:03:40.480 --> 00:03:42.060 
who support homework and that is simply
because<00:03:40.840> they<00:03:40.960> say<00:03:41.170> okay<00:03:41.440> practice<00:03:41.860> makes

00:03:42.060 --> 00:03:42.070 
because they say okay practice makes

00:03:42.070 --> 00:03:43.860 
because they say okay practice makes
perfect<00:03:42.280> and<00:03:42.700> on<00:03:43.030> paper<00:03:43.240> that<00:03:43.450> makes<00:03:43.630> sense

00:03:43.860 --> 00:03:43.870 
perfect and on paper that makes sense

00:03:43.870 --> 00:03:45.270 
perfect and on paper that makes sense
that<00:03:44.020> makes<00:03:44.200> incredible<00:03:44.770> sense<00:03:44.980> if<00:03:45.130> you

00:03:45.270 --> 00:03:45.280 
that makes incredible sense if you

00:03:45.280 --> 00:03:46.680 
that makes incredible sense if you
practice<00:03:45.700> more<00:03:45.910> you<00:03:46.030> will<00:03:46.210> get<00:03:46.360> paid<00:03:46.510> you<00:03:46.660> know

00:03:46.680 --> 00:03:46.690 
practice more you will get paid you know

00:03:46.690 --> 00:03:49.800 
practice more you will get paid you know
that's<00:03:46.990> just<00:03:47.170> the<00:03:47.260> fact<00:03:47.500> and<00:03:48.270> they<00:03:49.270> also<00:03:49.480> say

00:03:49.800 --> 00:03:49.810 
that's just the fact and they also say

00:03:49.810 --> 00:03:51.750 
that's just the fact and they also say
without<00:03:49.990> homework<00:03:50.350> where<00:03:51.040> where<00:03:51.490> does<00:03:51.700> it

without homework where where does it

00:03:51.760 --> 00:03:53.520

00:04:22.500 --> 00:04:22.510 
your subject but that's what some people

00:04:22.510 --> 00:04:25.290 
your subject but that's what some people
saying<00:04:22.950> personally<00:04:23.950> I<00:04:24.160> grew<00:04:24.610> both<00:04:24.850> sides<00:04:25.120> the

00:04:25.290 --> 00:04:25.300 
saying personally I grew both sides the

00:04:25.300 --> 00:04:27.300 
saying personally I grew both sides the
Beaufort<00:04:25.630> equally<00:04:26.170> you<00:04:26.770> know<00:04:26.890> measured

00:04:27.300 --> 00:04:27.310 
Beaufort equally you know measured

00:04:27.310 --> 00:04:30.180 
Beaufort equally you know measured
points<00:04:27.490> but<00:04:27.730> then<00:04:27.850> to<00:04:28.180> me<00:04:28.360> I<00:04:28.570> say<00:04:29.020> that<00:04:29.260> there

00:04:30.180 --> 00:04:30.190 
points but then to me I say that there

00:04:30.190 --> 00:04:31.800 
points but then to me I say that there
needs<00:04:30.460> to<00:04:30.550> be<00:04:30.610> a<00:04:30.700> line<00:04:30.970> to<00:04:31.210> what<00:04:31.419> is<00:04:31.570> and<00:04:31.780> what

00:04:31.800 --> 00:04:31.810 
needs to be a line to what is and what

00:04:31.810 --> 00:04:34.939 
needs to be a line to what is and what
isn't<00:04:32.050> homework<00:04:32.500> because

00:04:34.939 --> 00:04:34.949 

00:04:34.949 --> 00:04:39.809 

what<00:04:35.949> is<00:04:36.190> homework<00:04:36.520> is<00:04:37.710> like<00:04:38.710> doing<00:04:39.009> something

00:04:39.809 --> 00:04:39.819 
what is homework is like doing something

00:04:39.819 --> 00:04:44.040 
what is homework is like doing something
unrelated<00:04:40.500> to<00:04:41.500> your<00:04:42.000> to<00:04:43.000> your<00:04:43.389> current<00:04:43.720> work

00:04:44.040 --> 00:04:44.050 
unrelated to your to your current work

00:04:44.050 --> 00:04:46.409 
unrelated to your to your current work
isn't<00:04:44.470> isn't<00:04:45.400> necessary<00:04:46.000> to<00:04:46.150> me<00:04:46.270> because

00:04:46.409 --> 00:04:46.419 
isn't isn't necessary to me because

00:04:46.419 --> 00:04:47.909 
isn't isn't necessary to me because
that's<00:04:46.690> just<00:04:46.810> causing<00:04:47.050> unnecessary<00:04:47.410> stress

00:04:47.909 --> 00:04:47.919 
that's just causing unnecessary stress

00:04:47.919 --> 00:04:50.150 
that's just causing unnecessary stress
because<00:04:48.220> I<00:04:48.310> know<00:04:48.370> people<00:04:49.000> really<00:04:49.240> smart<00:04:49.930> but

00:04:50.150 --> 00:04:50.160 
because I know people really smart but

00:04:50.160 --> 00:04:52.320 
because I know people really smart but
just<00:04:51.160> lazy<00:04:51.370> to<00:04:51.610> do<00:04:51.729> the<00:04:51.880> homework<00:04:52.180> because

00:04:52.320 --> 00:04:52.330 
just lazy to do the homework because

00:04:52.330 --> 00:04:53.850 
just lazy to do the homework because
they<00:04:52.539> don't<00:04:52.720> see<00:04:52.870> a<00:04:52.900> point<00:04:53.050> in<00:04:53.229> it<00:04:53.410> and<00:04:53.560> they

00:04:53.850 --> 00:04:53.860 
they don't see a point in it and they

00:04:53.860 --> 00:04:55.800 
they don't see a point in it and they
feel<00:04:54.130> like<00:04:54.160> it<00:04:54.340> isn't<00:04:54.729> necessary<00:04:54.819> to<00:04:55.270> have<00:04:55.389> and

00:04:55.800 --> 00:04:55.810 
feel like it isn't necessary to have and

00:04:55.810 --> 00:04:57.360 
feel like it isn't necessary to have and
I<00:04:55.870> totally<00:04:56.110> agree<00:04:56.289> with<00:04:56.590> them<00:04:56.710> you<00:04:57.160> know<00:04:57.250> at

00:04:57.360 --> 00:04:57.370 
I totally agree with them you know at

00:04:57.370 --> 00:04:59.909 
I totally agree with them you know at
points<00:04:57.729> homework<00:04:58.360> is<00:04:58.539> really<00:04:59.139> unnecessary<00:04:59.289> to

00:04:59.909 --> 00:04:59.919 
points homework is really unnecessary to

00:04:59.919 --> 00:05:02.580 
points homework is really unnecessary to
have<00:05:00.180> but<00:05:01.180> if<00:05:01.479> it<00:05:01.900> is<00:05:01.930> something<00:05:02.380> like

00:05:02.580 --> 00:05:02.590 
have but if it is something like

00:05:02.590 --> 00:05:06.930 
have but if it is something like
revision<00:05:03.160> study<00:05:03.729> or<00:05:04.120> past<00:05:04.930> paper<00:05:05.259> tests<00:05:06.009> or<00:05:06.220> or

00:05:06.930 --> 00:05:06.940 
revision study or past paper tests or or

00:05:06.940 --> 00:05:08.850 
revision study or past paper tests or or
just<00:05:07.360> anything<00:05:07.599> of<00:05:07.810> that<00:05:07.840> nature<00:05:07.960> then<00:05:08.650> I<00:05:08.800> do

00:05:08.850 --> 00:05:08.860 
just anything of that nature then I do

00:05:08.860 --> 00:05:10.320 
just anything of that nature then I do
feel<00:05:09.160> homework<00:05:09.490> is<00:05:09.669> necessary<00:05:10.210> because

00:05:10.320 --> 00:05:10.330 
feel homework is necessary because

00:05:10.330 --> 00:05:11.570 
feel homework is necessary because
obviously<00:05:10.630> practice<00:05:11.199> doesn't<00:05:11.380> make<00:05:11.470> perfect

00:05:11.570 --> 00:05:11.580 
obviously practice doesn't make perfect

00:05:11.580 --> 00:05:14.460 
obviously practice doesn't make perfect
but<00:05:12.580> I<00:05:12.610> feel<00:05:13.000> that<00:05:13.030> they<00:05:13.870> shouldn't<00:05:14.139> get<00:05:14.289> rid

00:05:14.460 --> 00:05:14.470 
but I feel that they shouldn't get rid

00:05:14.470 --> 00:05:16.379 
but I feel that they shouldn't get rid
of<00:05:14.500> homework<00:05:14.949> although<00:05:15.430> they<00:05:15.610> should<00:05:15.940> they

00:05:16.379 --> 00:05:16.389 
of homework although they should they

00:05:16.389 --> 00:05:18.089 
of homework although they should they
should<00:05:16.419> at<00:05:16.660> least<00:05:16.810> strip<00:05:17.530> down<00:05:17.680> some<00:05:17.949> of<00:05:17.979> the

00:05:18.089 --> 00:05:18.099 
should at least strip down some of the

00:05:18.099 --> 00:05:20.310 
should at least strip down some of the
unnecessary<00:05:18.430> factors<00:05:19.150> because<00:05:19.330> in<00:05:19.780> real<00:05:20.110> life

00:05:20.310 --> 00:05:20.320 
unnecessary factors because in real life

00:05:20.320 --> 00:05:22.200 
unnecessary factors because in real life
that<00:05:20.710> doesn't<00:05:20.949> happen<00:05:21.280> you<00:05:21.550> know<00:05:21.669> you<00:05:21.729> don't
