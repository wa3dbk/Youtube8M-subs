00:00:53.060 --> 00:00:53.070 
teams they we talked to advisors and

00:00:53.070 --> 00:00:54.350 
teams they we talked to advisors and
they<00:00:53.160> would<00:00:53.280> tell<00:00:53.430> us<00:00:53.550> that<00:00:53.579> it<00:00:53.879> was<00:00:54.149> not

they would tell us that it was not
unrealistic<00:00:54.660> for<00:00:55.050> them<00:00:55.170> to<00:00:55.289> receive<00:00:55.620> like

00:00:56.510 --> 00:00:56.520 
unrealistic for them to receive like

00:00:56.520 --> 00:00:59.060 
unrealistic for them to receive like
prototype<00:00:57.090> weapons<00:00:57.530> upwards<00:00:58.530> of<00:00:58.590> like<00:00:58.770> five

prototype weapons upwards of like five

00:00:59.070 --> 00:01:00.529 
prototype weapons upwards of like five
years<00:00:59.340> out<00:00:59.609> in<00:00:59.640> advance<00:00:59.910> of<00:01:00.239> when<00:01:00.359> they<00:01:00.480> were

years out in advance of when they were
in<00:01:00.690> main<00:01:00.840> production<00:01:01.079> so<00:01:01.890> that<00:01:02.190> that's

00:01:02.389 --> 00:01:02.399 
in main production so that that's

00:01:02.399 --> 00:01:03.680 
in main production so that that's
allowed<00:01:02.670> us<00:01:02.699> to<00:01:02.879> get<00:01:03.090> our<00:01:03.180> hands<00:01:03.359> on<00:01:03.510> some

00:01:03.680 --> 00:01:03.690 
allowed us to get our hands on some

00:01:08.510 --> 00:01:08.520 
even made it into production right these

00:01:08.520 --> 00:01:10.940 
even made it into production right these
are<00:01:08.670> the<00:01:08.729> best<00:01:08.880> of<00:01:09.090> the<00:01:09.150> best<00:01:09.390> if<00:01:09.630> if<00:01:10.530> any
