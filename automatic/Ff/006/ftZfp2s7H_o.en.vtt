00:00:23.500 --> 00:00:26.470 

that's<00:00:24.500> the<00:00:24.650> critical<00:00:24.890> mass<00:00:25.220> right<00:00:26.030> as<00:00:26.180> it<00:00:26.330> was

00:00:26.470 --> 00:00:26.480 
that's the critical mass right as it was

that's the critical mass right as it was
starting<00:00:26.780> we're<00:00:27.380> about<00:00:27.440> a<00:00:27.590> block<00:00:27.680> away<00:00:28.160> and

00:00:28.300 --> 00:00:28.310 
starting we're about a block away and

00:00:28.310 --> 00:00:30.070 
starting we're about a block away and
noticed<00:00:28.940> that<00:00:29.180> the<00:00:29.480> bikes<00:00:29.690> were<00:00:29.870> already

00:00:30.070 --> 00:00:30.080 
noticed that the bikes were already

00:00:30.080 --> 00:00:40.750 
noticed that the bikes were already
taking<00:00:30.350> off

00:00:40.750 --> 00:00:40.760 

00:00:40.760 --> 00:00:43.010 

it's<00:00:41.760> only<00:00:42.030> been<00:00:42.150> a<00:00:42.210> couple<00:00:42.300> of<00:00:42.570> minutes<00:00:42.690> and

00:00:43.010 --> 00:00:43.020 
it's only been a couple of minutes and

00:00:43.020 --> 00:01:10.810 
it's only been a couple of minutes and
already<00:00:43.170> we<00:00:43.710> have<00:00:43.739> a<00:00:43.890> couple<00:00:44.100> bikers<00:00:44.640> down

00:01:10.810 --> 00:01:10.820 

00:01:10.820 --> 00:01:14.320

00:01:14.320 --> 00:01:14.330

really get a real good idea of how many
bikers<00:01:33.660> there<00:01:34.080> are

00:01:38.050 --> 00:01:38.060

00:01:49.010 --> 00:01:49.020 
critical mass bike ride we're at a

00:01:49.020 --> 00:01:51.950 
critical mass bike ride we're at a
Crenshaw<00:01:49.619> and<00:01:50.250> the<00:01:50.430> 10<00:01:50.670> and<00:01:51.299> we<00:01:51.510> rode<00:01:51.750> all<00:01:51.930> the

00:01:51.950 --> 00:01:51.960 
Crenshaw and the 10 and we rode all the

00:01:51.960 --> 00:01:55.880 
Crenshaw and the 10 and we rode all the
way<00:01:52.110> from<00:01:52.229> Western<00:01:53.040> on<00:01:53.340> measure<00:01:54.140> and<00:01:55.140> I<00:01:55.170> can't

00:01:55.880 --> 00:01:55.890 
way from Western on measure and I can't

00:01:55.890 --> 00:01:58.149 
way from Western on measure and I can't
believe<00:01:56.040> how<00:01:56.220> many<00:01:56.280> people<00:01:56.550> there<00:01:56.850> are<00:01:56.909> a

00:01:58.149 --> 00:01:58.159 
believe how many people there are a

00:01:58.159 --> 00:02:04.310 
believe how many people there are a
rough<00:01:59.159> estimation<00:02:00.090> I'd<00:02:00.420> say<00:02:01.280> low-end<00:02:02.300> 500<00:02:03.320> so

00:02:04.310 --> 00:02:04.320 
rough estimation I'd say low-end 500 so

00:02:04.320 --> 00:02:07.490 
rough estimation I'd say low-end 500 so
it's<00:02:04.800> pretty<00:02:04.979> good<00:02:05.190> turnout<00:02:05.990> a<00:02:06.990> lot<00:02:07.350> of<00:02:07.380> people

00:02:07.490 --> 00:02:07.500 
it's pretty good turnout a lot of people

00:02:07.500 --> 00:02:10.699 
it's pretty good turnout a lot of people
are<00:02:08.009> really<00:02:08.039> excited<00:02:09.080> it's<00:02:10.080> a<00:02:10.170> good<00:02:10.319> time<00:02:10.500> out

00:02:10.699 --> 00:02:10.709 
are really excited it's a good time out

00:02:10.709 --> 00:02:12.920 
are really excited it's a good time out
here
