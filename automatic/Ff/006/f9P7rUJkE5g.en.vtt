I<00:04:36.320> always<00:04:36.710> thought<00:04:36.920> that<00:04:37.100> he<00:04:37.280> was<00:04:37.430> looking<00:04:37.820> to

00:04:37.840 --> 00:04:37.850 
I always thought that he was looking to

00:04:37.850 --> 00:04:40.840 
I always thought that he was looking to
replace<00:04:38.270> me<00:04:38.570> for<00:04:39.170> some<00:04:39.380> reason<00:04:39.410> if<00:04:40.340> I<00:04:40.580> got

00:04:40.840 --> 00:04:40.850 
replace me for some reason if I got

00:04:40.850 --> 00:04:42.910 
replace me for some reason if I got
blocked<00:04:41.240> or<00:04:41.660> I<00:04:41.690> got<00:04:42.080> knocked<00:04:42.320> down<00:04:42.500> it<00:04:42.830> was

00:04:42.910 --> 00:04:42.920 
blocked or I got knocked down it was

00:04:42.920 --> 00:04:46.300 
blocked or I got knocked down it was
because<00:04:43.280> I<00:04:43.430> was<00:04:43.580> too<00:04:44.570> small<00:04:44.930> as<00:04:45.710> opposed<00:04:46.130> to

00:04:46.300 --> 00:04:46.310 
because I was too small as opposed to

00:04:46.310 --> 00:04:48.220 
because I was too small as opposed to
some<00:04:46.820> guy<00:04:47.000> just<00:04:47.240> not<00:04:47.420> get<00:04:47.630> me<00:04:47.690> down<00:04:47.870> because

after<00:04:48.530> all<00:04:48.560> if<00:04:48.980> you<00:04:49.100> playing<00:04:49.340> football<00:04:49.550> you<00:04:49.730> do

00:04:50.020 --> 00:04:50.030 
after all if you playing football you do

00:04:50.030 --> 00:04:52.540 
after all if you playing football you do
at<00:04:50.480> times<00:04:50.810> whine<00:04:51.110> if<00:04:51.260> I'm<00:04:51.380> here<00:04:51.560> right<00:04:52.040> and<00:04:52.490> I

00:04:52.540 --> 00:04:52.550 
at times whine if I'm here right and I

00:04:52.550 --> 00:04:54.520 
at times whine if I'm here right and I
look<00:04:52.760> back<00:04:53.000> on<00:04:53.270> it<00:04:53.390> now<00:04:53.420> I<00:04:53.540> realized<00:04:54.080> that<00:04:54.260> if

00:04:54.520 --> 00:04:54.530 
look back on it now I realized that if

00:04:54.530 --> 00:04:56.380 
look back on it now I realized that if
it<00:04:54.680> hadn't<00:04:54.980> been<00:04:55.070> for<00:04:55.370> that<00:04:55.610> type<00:04:56.030> of<00:04:56.060> thing

00:04:56.380 --> 00:04:56.390 
it hadn't been for that type of thing

00:04:56.390 --> 00:04:58.000 
it hadn't been for that type of thing
bleeding<00:04:56.810> through<00:04:57.020> my<00:04:57.170> whole<00:04:57.350> career<00:04:57.770> I

00:04:58.000 --> 00:04:58.010 
bleeding through my whole career I

00:04:58.010 --> 00:04:59.680 
bleeding through my whole career I
probably<00:04:58.460> wouldn't<00:04:58.700> push<00:04:58.910> myself<00:04:59.120> as<00:04:59.480> hard<00:04:59.510> as

00:04:59.680 --> 00:04:59.690 
probably wouldn't push myself as hard as

00:04:59.690 --> 00:05:02.980 
probably wouldn't push myself as hard as
I<00:04:59.810> did<00:04:59.870> and<00:05:00.170> uh<00:05:00.200> I<00:05:00.880> realized<00:05:01.880> that<00:05:02.150> that<00:05:02.780> wasn't

00:05:02.980 --> 00:05:02.990 
I did and uh I realized that that wasn't

00:05:02.990 --> 00:05:05.590 
I did and uh I realized that that wasn't
my<00:05:03.200> problem<00:05:03.560> cause<00:05:03.650> I<00:05:03.830> thought<00:05:04.010> it<00:05:04.790> helped<00:05:05.360> me

00:05:05.590 --> 00:05:05.600 
my problem cause I thought it helped me

00:05:05.600 --> 00:05:09.400 
my problem cause I thought it helped me
more<00:05:06.200> so<00:05:06.560> than<00:05:06.890> it<00:05:07.070> then<00:05:07.700> it<00:05:07.880> did<00:05:08.150> go<00:05:08.900> against

00:05:09.400 --> 00:05:09.410 
more so than it then it did go against

00:05:09.410 --> 00:05:12.040 
more so than it then it did go against
me<00:05:09.590> because<00:05:10.070> the<00:05:10.220> end<00:05:10.370> result<00:05:10.730> was<00:05:10.910> I<00:05:11.240> played
