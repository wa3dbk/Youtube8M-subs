00:00:31.439 --> 00:00:35.250
 That thing is a book I have. 

00:00:33.149 --> 00:00:37.079

00:00:35.250 --> 00:00:39.300
 I even had him put in the marathon 

00:00:37.079 --> 00:00:42.719

00:00:39.300 --> 00:00:45.989
 book I have not yet 2 

00:00:42.719 --> 00:00:48.180
 everyone likes - I do not know if everything 

00:00:45.989 --> 00:00:50.910
 world but most people like 

00:00:48.180 --> 00:00:54.660
 rock of light I think this series sucks 

00:00:50.910 --> 00:00:56.160
 It is until I read the sixth book type not 

00:00:54.660 --> 00:00:58.260
 I understand why he is the sixth book. 

00:00:56.160 --> 00:00:58.859
 because in the third since days the guy 

00:00:58.260 --> 00:01:01.140
 her 

00:00:58.859 --> 00:01:03.090
 the main character is very chicken 

00:01:01.140 --> 00:01:06.000
 I can not understand how it works. 

00:01:03.090 --> 00:01:09.479
 Her mind so I do not short and I know 

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:12.450
 that a lot of people like but I do not like 

00:01:09.479 --> 00:01:15.540
 3 nobody reads but I like 

00:01:12.450 --> 00:01:18.960
 there was a dilemma this issue can 

00:01:15.540 --> 00:01:21.720
 read everything someone law someone like then 

00:01:18.960 --> 00:01:25.200
 I thought of something I read this. 

00:01:21.720 --> 00:01:28.080
 does not remember the package insert so it 

00:01:25.200 --> 00:01:29.490
 a book is a bull I have a habit myself 

00:01:28.080 --> 00:01:31.350

00:01:29.490 --> 00:01:34.049
 I'm the one who keeps watching. 

00:01:31.350 --> 00:01:36.390
 what are the adverse reactions and then 

00:01:34.049 --> 00:01:37.950
 I feel the adverse reactions because 

00:01:36.390 --> 00:01:40.439
 I got it in my head that I read 

00:01:37.950 --> 00:01:42.780
 That you and I end up feeling something. 

00:01:40.439 --> 00:01:47.610
 that nobody reads but I like it is 

00:01:42.780 --> 00:01:48.869
 I have curious remedy I have no desire 

00:01:47.610 --> 00:01:50.189
 to conclude 

00:01:48.869 --> 00:01:53.670
 I want to finish the series 

00:01:50.189 --> 00:01:56.610

00:02:16.160 --> 00:02:23.120
 One day I can finish all three 

00:02:17.750 --> 00:02:24.860
