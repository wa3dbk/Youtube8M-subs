00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.629
 Nine people and welcome to 

00:00:03.179 --> 00:00:10.530
 a new tutorial of text and 240 

00:00:06.629 --> 00:00:11.099
 this time the charts and a chart 

00:00:10.530 --> 00:00:13.530
 inc 

00:00:11.099 --> 00:00:16.080
 what it brings I show now times completely 

00:00:13.530 --> 00:00:21.630
 just one of them looks just like that 

00:00:16.080 --> 00:00:25.320
 the mk1 there is 31 mk2 mp3 mp3 is june 

00:00:21.630 --> 00:00:27.240
 the strongest 1 lemke the smallest 

00:00:25.320 --> 00:00:30.840
 You can see here you have a little here 

00:00:27.240 --> 00:00:35.219
 field and still so next to field and one 

00:00:30.840 --> 00:00:37.110
 Energy input since the mk 1 is here 

00:00:35.219 --> 00:00:37.649
 Of course, low voltage can be yes 

00:00:37.110 --> 00:00:40.950
 think 

00:00:37.649 --> 00:00:45.360
 That's why I have one of them here 

00:00:40.950 --> 00:00:47.010
 a blackbox and do me in the battery 

00:00:45.360 --> 00:00:49.050
 pure and as you can see you get now 

00:00:47.010 --> 00:00:52.260
 energy if i am here for example now 

00:00:49.050 --> 00:00:54.320
 batteries are pure tour then with the 

00:00:52.260 --> 00:00:57.090
 the time is loaded 

00:00:54.320 --> 00:01:00.000
 when would then income behind me 

00:00:57.090 --> 00:01:02.129
 if you load them so slowly 

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:06.119
 So that's a kind of charging station for 

00:01:02.129 --> 00:01:11.250
 Batteries so the whole one can mourn 

00:01:06.119 --> 00:01:12.600
 with for example with glasfiber me 

00:01:11.250 --> 00:01:16.259
 Show yourself now for a short time like 

00:01:12.600 --> 00:01:19.650
 you build a mk 1 for it 

00:01:16.259 --> 00:01:21.330
 I need you first here 

00:01:19.650 --> 00:01:24.830
 little material you need 

00:01:21.330 --> 00:01:27.479
 every case of rubber copper gold and 

00:01:24.830 --> 00:01:28.799
 referee iron furnace just do 

00:01:27.479 --> 00:01:32.579
 just train just one 

00:01:28.799 --> 00:01:35.540
 Oven gets its benefits and 

00:01:32.579 --> 00:01:40.520
 Redstone would be pretty good and wood panels 

00:01:35.540 --> 00:01:43.259
 so you need such a kind for mk1 

00:01:40.520 --> 00:01:46.350
 unadorned copper cable made of three copper 

00:01:43.259 --> 00:01:49.119
 were you doing that over here ? 

00:01:46.350 --> 00:01:55.390
 and below that just 

00:01:49.119 --> 00:01:58.759
 already from the chart inc mk1 not 

00:01:55.390 --> 00:02:00.590
 then there are some with gold cable 

00:01:58.759 --> 00:02:03.350
 then they still get that way 

00:02:00.590 --> 00:02:06.020
 a little bit more out there you do that 

00:02:03.350 --> 00:02:08.119
 just like that and so on and so on 

00:02:06.020 --> 00:02:14.930
 there is still something missing and this time 

00:02:08.119 --> 00:02:17.450
 we need another one on the circuit 

00:02:14.930 --> 00:02:20.750
 For this we need copper cable first 

00:02:17.450 --> 00:02:22.640
 made of copper lead copper and six 

00:02:20.750 --> 00:02:27.280
 grammys and we already have copper cables 

00:02:22.640 --> 00:02:31.180
 for that we need redstone and 

00:02:27.280 --> 00:02:33.290
 benefit it here first that here 

00:02:31.180 --> 00:02:35.989
 he is in the middle and one 

00:02:33.290 --> 00:02:38.690
 redstone here and here are electric 

00:02:35.989 --> 00:02:41.299
 circus then here comes wood wood wood 

00:02:38.690 --> 00:02:46.310
 and wood and gold gold and gold 

00:02:41.299 --> 00:02:48.230
 have a batch human in k2 yes so 

00:02:46.310 --> 00:02:53.269
 I 'm even better 

00:02:48.230 --> 00:02:56.150
 Two of them, there is something else called 

00:02:53.269 --> 00:03:00.859
 a waist comes on high voltage 

00:02:56.150 --> 00:03:03.130
 cable out and he does that easily 

00:03:00.859 --> 00:03:03.130
 up 

00:03:03.489 --> 00:03:08.840
 of course I will be the train 

00:03:05.269 --> 00:03:11.660
 Let's forget about a circus like that again 

00:03:08.840 --> 00:03:17.810
 always build a short one there I have to go again 

00:03:11.660 --> 00:03:22.250
 make new copper cable so bad 

00:03:17.810 --> 00:03:26.150
 that in the call one animals and then 

00:03:22.250 --> 00:03:28.730
 here in retzow not so with the electric 

00:03:26.150 --> 00:03:31.130
 circus we do the following we packed 

00:03:28.730 --> 00:03:34.480
 him in the middle then come here lay up 

00:03:31.130 --> 00:03:34.480
 towards and 4 

00:03:34.550 --> 00:03:38.430
 Germany faltered had to get two 

00:03:36.720 --> 00:03:41.340
 what had to do that still needs one 

00:03:38.430 --> 00:03:46.099
 a bit of dust then a lot of redstone 

00:03:41.340 --> 00:03:51.890
 here then and advance have then wood 

00:03:46.099 --> 00:03:53.849
 and scrap cable already mk3 so 

00:03:51.890 --> 00:03:59.190
 Meanwhile it has become the night 

00:03:53.849 --> 00:03:59.760
 do not make it so nice and then we'll see 

00:03:59.190 --> 00:04:08.400
 go here 

00:03:59.760 --> 00:04:14.549
 I build the times individually on her needs 

00:04:08.400 --> 00:04:22.260
 still this cable here so one could in the 

00:04:14.549 --> 00:04:27.570
 11er to beat and the whole with the mfs 

00:04:22.260 --> 00:04:28.470
 and one of a tradingrange mk3 there 

00:04:27.570 --> 00:04:31.050
 I could sometimes even a 

00:04:28.470 --> 00:04:32.699
 blow the battery in so it works 

00:04:31.050 --> 00:04:36.270
 the whole here will be loaded here 

00:04:32.699 --> 00:04:37.860
 complus no more electricity here now 

00:04:36.270 --> 00:04:39.330
 could I do the same with the 

00:04:37.860 --> 00:04:42.419
 Battery is now so slow 

00:04:39.330 --> 00:04:43.919
 charges and here it myself also 

00:04:42.419 --> 00:04:50.689
 times I have no empty 

00:04:43.919 --> 00:04:52.969
 Here , too, looked up so slowly 

00:04:50.689 --> 00:04:55.219
 here also with the theme 

00:04:52.969 --> 00:04:56.449
 You can do it purely as you can see 

00:04:55.219 --> 00:04:58.819
 So they always get faster 

00:04:56.449 --> 00:05:02.869
 the faster the better and the better 

00:04:58.819 --> 00:05:08.149
 all the yes is logical because of 

00:05:02.869 --> 00:05:09.829
 high currents and more 

00:05:08.149 --> 00:05:12.799
 You can not always do that 

00:05:09.829 --> 00:05:15.049
 the same memory works the same way 

00:05:12.799 --> 00:05:16.369
 that was a short tutorial now 

00:05:15.049 --> 00:05:18.229
 you see what they bring 

00:05:16.369 --> 00:05:23.089
 SchÃ¤rding is English means charging 

00:05:18.229 --> 00:05:24.889
 I do not think so and yes that was 

00:05:23.089 --> 00:05:25.969
 actually everything on the subject I hope 

00:05:24.889 --> 00:05:26.449
 this has got you a bit further now 

00:05:25.969 --> 00:05:28.069
 brought 

00:05:26.449 --> 00:05:29.959
 and if you still wish or 

00:05:28.069 --> 00:05:32.449
 have suggestions can you likes to call 

00:05:29.959 --> 00:05:35.259
 and there I would say until the 

00:05:32.449 --> 00:05:35.259
 next time
