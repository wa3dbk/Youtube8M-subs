00:00:05.450 --> 00:00:12.830
 Hello everyone, today I am reviewing the clock 

00:00:08.750 --> 00:00:15.210
 shout with black on model 2013 

00:00:12.830 --> 00:00:17.789
 Emperor scanjet which means 

00:00:15.210 --> 00:00:22.010
 imperial greatness there is to acquire 

00:00:17.789 --> 00:00:24.990
 such an instance you can from 150 to 250 

00:00:22.010 --> 00:00:27.539
 dollars that is up to 300 dollars you can 

00:00:24.990 --> 00:00:30.510
 count means let's see 

00:00:27.539 --> 00:00:32.369
 what comes with it is not necessary and 

00:00:30.510 --> 00:00:36.300
 letter of thanks from the company for 

00:00:32.369 --> 00:00:38.210
 purchase intex instructions for use 

00:00:36.300 --> 00:00:41.969
 how to wind your watch 

00:00:38.210 --> 00:00:46.350
 envelope with a warranty card from 

00:00:41.969 --> 00:00:48.000
 rational guarantee 2 years handkerchief 

00:00:46.350 --> 00:00:52.620
 never seen to use it 

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:54.030
 but of course the clock means the case and 

00:00:52.620 --> 00:00:55.079
 the insides are made of stainless 

00:00:54.030 --> 00:00:58.590
 become 

00:00:55.079 --> 00:01:00.859
 twenty three carats of gold as you see 

00:00:58.590 --> 00:01:02.879
 doctor two dials 

00:01:00.859 --> 00:01:07.460
 a small display showing time 

00:01:02.879 --> 00:01:10.080
 days moon and sun 

00:01:07.460 --> 00:01:12.270
 it means the glass is made of incomprehensible 

00:01:10.080 --> 00:01:15.840
 caster crystal never hear about 

00:01:12.270 --> 00:01:20.400
 him measuring hours sleep competent 

00:01:15.840 --> 00:01:21.409
 thickness 13 millimeters diameter forty 

00:01:20.400 --> 00:01:25.400
 nine millimeters 

00:01:21.409 --> 00:01:29.900
 honestly the clock is heavy but 

00:01:25.400 --> 00:01:31.079
 I feel nice on the arm of the watch 

00:01:29.900 --> 00:01:35.790
 auto 

00:01:31.079 --> 00:01:39.259
 st nine 1011 company promises that 

00:01:35.790 --> 00:01:42.409
 the reserve is approximately five days 

00:01:39.259 --> 00:01:47.290
 go to the strap is not lacquered bag 

00:01:42.409 --> 00:01:49.510
 made from black crocodile leather 

00:01:47.290 --> 00:01:52.030
 as the company says I do not know how it is 

00:01:49.510 --> 00:01:54.510
 true, but it says channel is all 

00:01:52.030 --> 00:01:57.880
 means natural leather 

00:01:54.510 --> 00:01:59.440
 watch waterproof at 10 meters but 

00:01:57.880 --> 00:02:03.030
 Sin probably with some strap and 

00:01:59.440 --> 00:02:06.340
 buy my opinion of this watch 

00:02:03.030 --> 00:02:07.000
 probably not the most pleasant i would down 3 

00:02:06.340 --> 00:02:09.940
 from 5 

00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:10.740
 Of course they look much more expensive than 

00:02:09.940 --> 00:02:14.590
 they are standing 

00:02:10.740 --> 00:02:17.700
 but I donâ€™t know how exactly the strap is 

00:02:14.590 --> 00:02:17.700
 leather 

00:02:17.790 --> 00:02:21.280
 incomprehensible crystal caster nowhere 

00:02:20.770 --> 00:02:25.740
 I hear 

00:02:21.280 --> 00:02:29.680
 and the mechanism is frankly a complete bullshit 

00:02:25.740 --> 00:02:30.430
 he probably holds a maximum of two days 

00:02:29.680 --> 00:02:32.920
 if a 

00:02:30.430 --> 00:02:36.459
 that is, tristique is not always necessary 

00:02:32.920 --> 00:02:38.020
 this clock is like a rattle well, leave it in 

00:02:36.459 --> 00:02:40.989
 coma so what do you think of this watch 

00:02:38.020 --> 00:02:45.070
 would you buy them or not if something 

00:02:40.989 --> 00:02:47.980
 know about the mechanism of yust 9011 

00:02:45.070 --> 00:02:51.450
 write also in the comments and also if you 

00:02:47.980 --> 00:02:54.750
 know something crystal christ 

00:02:51.450 --> 00:02:54.750
