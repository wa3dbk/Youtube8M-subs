00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.840
 and so hello you welcomes 

00:00:01.890 --> 00:00:05.700
 channel mazik here today's video lesson I 

00:00:03.840 --> 00:00:08.519
 I want to talk about counter-strike 

00:00:05.700 --> 00:00:11.670
 exactly the mistakes that arise 

00:00:08.519 --> 00:00:16.440
 many more precisely this error has arisen in 

00:00:11.670 --> 00:00:22.529
 I have the problem of counter-strike such that 

00:00:16.440 --> 00:00:24.630
 with a long time 

00:00:22.529 --> 00:00:27.390
 the computer starts hard moisture 

00:00:24.630 --> 00:00:28.130
 contrast rogue run fast all that 

00:00:27.390 --> 00:00:31.710
 console 

00:00:28.130 --> 00:00:35.850
 pointers quickly blink pps quickly 

00:00:31.710 --> 00:00:38.700
 moves and everything but it turns out 

00:00:35.850 --> 00:00:42.360
 speedhack throughout the country although it's nobody 

00:00:38.700 --> 00:00:45.379
 these are hard lags and so to solve this 

00:00:42.360 --> 00:00:52.250
 The problem is like two ways first 

00:00:45.379 --> 00:00:55.500
 the way this here is contra lines launched 

00:00:52.250 --> 00:01:02.539
 console is ok everything but when entering on 

00:00:55.500 --> 00:01:02.539
 the series will be terrible I will run terribly 

00:01:02.750 --> 00:01:07.860
 can you somewhere noticed how well speed hack 

00:01:06.210 --> 00:01:10.159
 this is not the speedhack of men so to speak 

00:01:07.860 --> 00:01:12.750
 click to trial alte leid 

00:01:10.159 --> 00:01:15.810
 We find you will depart 

00:01:12.750 --> 00:01:16.380
 application click processes we find CHL 

00:01:15.810 --> 00:01:19.170
 . 

00:01:16.380 --> 00:01:19.979
 exe right click set 

00:01:19.170 --> 00:01:23.670
 conformity 

00:01:19.979 --> 00:01:25.770
 we choose the second tick also who 

00:01:23.670 --> 00:01:28.380
 This problem can not also 

00:01:25.770 --> 00:01:33.420
 in the same way to arrange you this 

00:01:28.380 --> 00:01:35.369
 the problem is just remove the tick from you 

00:01:33.420 --> 00:01:37.650
 from the problems there and we have this 

00:01:35.369 --> 00:01:38.220
 the problem is solved after that you 

00:01:37.650 --> 00:01:40.439
 will be 

00:01:38.220 --> 00:01:45.090
 counter-strike as if they stop 

00:01:40.439 --> 00:01:47.670
 lag is a normal game well this way 

00:01:45.090 --> 00:01:48.450
 need to repeat every time you go 

00:01:47.670 --> 00:01:51.329
 in counter-strike 

00:01:48.450 --> 00:01:54.060
 I use this method every time I 

00:01:51.329 --> 00:01:57.829
 each time you enter the contra line 

00:01:54.060 --> 00:01:59.700
 removing the tick press ok and closing and 

00:01:57.829 --> 00:02:02.189
 I have everything here 

00:01:59.700 --> 00:02:04.799
 excellent then an example shows 

00:02:02.189 --> 00:02:08.429
 I will not be as you will see everything 

00:02:04.799 --> 00:02:11.000
 lag itself prog which I 

00:02:08.429 --> 00:02:18.430
 I write down my screen 

00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:25.150
 the second way is now create a shortcut 

00:02:18.430 --> 00:02:27.950
 pull it out so push the properties 

00:02:25.150 --> 00:02:30.730
 compatibility and here and click run 

00:02:27.950 --> 00:02:33.380
 program in mode with 

00:02:30.730 --> 00:02:34.250
 accordingly sti with windows m so 

00:02:33.380 --> 00:02:39.950
 windows time 

00:02:34.250 --> 00:02:41.900
 you will stand 95 set 98 push 

00:02:39.950 --> 00:02:48.640
 I will not do it like this 

00:02:41.900 --> 00:02:50.690
 how now use the first method when 

00:02:48.640 --> 00:02:52.640
 counter strike 

00:02:50.690 --> 00:02:54.410
