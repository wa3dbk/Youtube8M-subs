00:02:50.809 --> 00:02:50.819 
getting your b complex liquid and

00:02:50.819 --> 00:02:53.150 
getting your b complex liquid and
they've<00:02:51.060> got<00:02:51.090> some<00:02:51.720> biotin<00:02:52.230> in<00:02:52.380> it<00:02:52.530> but<00:02:52.980> i'm

00:02:53.150 --> 00:02:53.160 
they've got some biotin in it but i'm

00:02:53.160 --> 00:02:55.309 
they've got some biotin in it but i'm
taking<00:02:53.579> a<00:02:53.670> lot<00:02:53.849> of<00:02:53.880> biotin<00:02:54.180> during<00:02:54.720> the<00:02:54.840> day<00:02:55.019> in

00:02:55.309 --> 00:02:55.319 
taking a lot of biotin during the day in

00:02:55.319 --> 00:02:59.509 
taking a lot of biotin during the day in
my<00:02:55.769> bariatric<00:02:56.340> advantage<00:02:56.760> and<00:02:58.519> multivitamin

00:02:59.509 --> 00:02:59.519 
my bariatric advantage and multivitamin

00:02:59.519 --> 00:03:04.490 
my bariatric advantage and multivitamin
I<00:02:59.730> think<00:03:00.480> I'm<00:03:00.599> getting<00:03:02.299> like<00:03:03.299> 2,000<00:03:04.170> percent

00:03:04.490 --> 00:03:04.500 
I think I'm getting like 2,000 percent

00:03:04.500 --> 00:03:06.259 
I think I'm getting like 2,000 percent
of<00:03:04.739> the<00:03:04.950> biotin<00:03:05.400> i'm<00:03:05.640> supposed<00:03:05.910> to<00:03:06.000> beginning

00:03:06.259 --> 00:03:06.269 
of the biotin i'm supposed to beginning

00:03:06.269 --> 00:03:08.870 
of the biotin i'm supposed to beginning
i<00:03:06.480> think<00:03:06.690> that's<00:03:06.900> what<00:03:07.140> it<00:03:07.290> for<00:03:07.860> the<00:03:07.950> day<00:03:08.130> and

00:03:08.870 --> 00:03:08.880 
i think that's what it for the day and

00:03:08.880 --> 00:03:10.280 
i think that's what it for the day and
so<00:03:09.209> i<00:03:09.269> feel<00:03:09.450> like<00:03:09.510> i'm<00:03:09.780> getting<00:03:09.810> a<00:03:10.140> lot<00:03:10.260> of
