00:00:07.990 --> 00:00:13.180
 hi the quiches so today we 

00:00:11.120 --> 00:00:15.370
 will see 

00:00:13.180 --> 00:00:17.290
 which we do not think often is 

00:00:15.370 --> 00:00:18.970
 how to record a piece of a dvd 

00:00:17.290 --> 00:00:23.050
 or any video from elsewhere 

00:00:18.970 --> 00:00:26.110
 with vlc so a priori we know vlc 

00:00:23.050 --> 00:00:27.310
 to be a video player but vlc 

00:00:26.110 --> 00:00:30.250
 allows to record also 

00:00:27.310 --> 00:00:33.129
 automatically very little known function 

00:00:30.250 --> 00:00:34.840
 so I 'm going to open a video in 

00:00:33.129 --> 00:00:38.710
 general the simplest is to use 

00:00:34.840 --> 00:00:41.530
 it for a DVD since otherwise it 

00:00:38.710 --> 00:00:45.660
 would just cut the video so I 

00:00:41.530 --> 00:00:45.660
 launches the video 

00:00:46.350 --> 00:00:52.450
 here I am going to pause 

00:00:49.840 --> 00:00:55.140
 then to record with vlc anything 

00:00:52.450 --> 00:00:57.399
 simpler there is a button here 

00:00:55.140 --> 00:00:59.320
 record just stupidly 

00:00:57.399 --> 00:01:02.829
 so in fact just pass it 

00:00:59.320 --> 00:01:04.750
 his video until the moment and 

00:01:02.829 --> 00:01:07.750
 to press this button then the only 

00:01:04.750 --> 00:01:10.180
 that then the only constraint is 

00:01:07.750 --> 00:01:13.690
 leave the recording until the end 

00:01:10.180 --> 00:01:15.970
 the desired extract but vlc is loading 

00:01:13.690 --> 00:01:20.020
 of everything there is nothing to do so I 

00:01:15.970 --> 00:01:27.940
 will go to the area that 

00:01:20.020 --> 00:01:29.729
 I'm interested here I press the button 

00:01:27.940 --> 00:01:32.729
 save 

00:01:29.729 --> 00:01:32.729
 so 

00:01:33.259 --> 00:01:37.439
 then we have the impression that he does not 

00:01:35.460 --> 00:01:49.500
 goes nothing but actually 

00:01:37.439 --> 00:01:52.490
 vlc recording all that then 

00:01:49.500 --> 00:01:52.490
 we'll be back in a few minutes 

00:02:14.670 --> 00:02:20.470
 well here I am at the end of my 

00:02:17.530 --> 00:02:22.770
 extract so I'm going to stop 

00:02:20.470 --> 00:02:27.130
 the record 

00:02:22.770 --> 00:02:31.080
 so I 'm waiting to be I 'm waiting to be 

00:02:27.130 --> 00:02:31.080
 exactly to the point that I wish 

00:02:42.569 --> 00:02:49.950
 here I press again we will avoid 

00:02:48.510 --> 00:02:52.200
 to have the sound in your ears 

00:02:49.950 --> 00:02:54.689
 I press again so the button 

00:02:52.200 --> 00:02:56.459
 record who becomes white a priori 

00:02:54.689 --> 00:02:58.950
 nothing happened but actually my 

00:02:56.459 --> 00:03:01.709
 extract was saved then this 

00:02:58.950 --> 00:03:03.060
 default windows and by the way all 

00:03:01.709 --> 00:03:06.530
 the other systems saas and records 

00:03:03.060 --> 00:03:16.430
 in the video directory 

00:03:06.530 --> 00:03:20.879
 so I go in the folder but video 

00:03:16.430 --> 00:03:23.819
 here and here is my excerpt that were 

00:03:20.879 --> 00:03:26.540
 saved then by default he gets started 

00:03:23.819 --> 00:03:26.540
 in mp4 

00:03:26.689 --> 00:03:31.079
 this is whatever your file 

00:03:29.849 --> 00:03:34.650
 saved then if you save a 

00:03:31.079 --> 00:03:37.219
 dvd for example be careful because by 

00:03:34.650 --> 00:03:39.419
 default vlc will fetch the soundtrack 

00:03:37.219 --> 00:03:42.629
 main dvd so if you have a 

00:03:39.419 --> 00:03:44.370
 dvd from a port and you choose the 

00:03:42.629 --> 00:03:47.579
 French track your recording 

00:03:44.370 --> 00:03:49.739
 will be in the DVD language of a step so 

00:03:47.579 --> 00:03:50.819
 we can check that it works 

00:03:49.739 --> 00:03:54.919
 well and it starts well 

00:03:50.819 --> 00:03:57.359
 where I wanted and where I stopped 

00:03:54.919 --> 00:04:00.660
 so the video starts right where I 

00:03:57.359 --> 00:04:07.230
 wish and she stops 

00:04:00.660 --> 00:04:09.390
 exactly where I wanted so here is this 

00:04:07.230 --> 00:04:12.740
 little tutorial go hi the quiches and to 

00:04:09.390 --> 00:04:12.740
 soon for an upcoming tutorial
