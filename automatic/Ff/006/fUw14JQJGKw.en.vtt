00:00:12.719 --> 00:00:15.415
 You changed things, 

00:00:17.573 --> 00:00:19.045
 forever. 

00:00:20.812 --> 00:00:22.293
 there's no way back. 

00:00:25.052 --> 00:00:28.478
 You see, for them you're just a freak 

00:00:32.515 --> 00:00:33.963
 exactly like me. 

00:00:44.452 --> 00:00:46.653
 What do we know about him? -Nothing. 

00:00:46.654 --> 00:00:48.783
 No name or nickname. 

00:00:49.077 --> 00:00:50.856
 Nor about his clothes. 

00:00:51.207 --> 00:00:53.255
 There is nothing in his pockets except knives and lint. 

00:00:54.987 --> 00:00:57.517
 Good evening, sir. 

00:01:01.154 --> 00:01:02.880
 why so serious? 

00:01:07.577 --> 00:01:08.979
 where is he? 

00:01:10.661 --> 00:01:12.431
 dead people, 

00:01:12.432 --> 00:01:13.775
 What should I do? 

00:01:13.776 --> 00:01:16.750
 Suffer it, you can be ostracized, 

00:01:18.112 --> 00:01:20.299
 You can make the decision that no one will deal with it. 

00:01:21.863 --> 00:01:24.646
 The right decision. Gotham needs you. 

00:01:26.620 --> 00:01:28.946
 A little warrior. I like this. 

00:01:29.047 --> 00:01:30.700
 So you'll die for me. 

00:01:32.116 --> 00:01:33.889
 That's better, Mr. Wayne. 

00:01:43.350 --> 00:01:46.129
 Everything is just part of the plan. 

00:01:46.891 --> 00:01:48.232
 forward! You'll hurt me! 

00:01:52.572 --> 00:01:55.403
 Let's put a smile on that face. 

00:01:56.741 --> 00:02:01.896
