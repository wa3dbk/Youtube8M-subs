doesn't<00:03:17.880> he<00:03:17.910> i<00:03:18.030> mean<00:03:18.150> if<00:03:18.269> if<00:03:18.420> he<00:03:18.810> swings<00:03:19.049> too

00:03:19.340 --> 00:03:19.350 
doesn't he i mean if if he swings too

00:03:19.350 --> 00:03:22.069 
doesn't he i mean if if he swings too
far<00:03:19.590> to<00:03:19.739> the<00:03:19.769> left<00:03:20.239> it'd<00:03:21.239> be<00:03:21.630> pretty<00:03:21.840> difficult

00:03:22.069 --> 00:03:22.079 
far to the left it'd be pretty difficult

00:03:22.079 --> 00:03:23.920 
far to the left it'd be pretty difficult
for<00:03:22.590> him<00:03:22.680> in<00:03:22.859> some<00:03:23.070> respects<00:03:23.489> i<00:03:23.730> mean

00:03:23.920 --> 00:03:23.930 
for him in some respects i mean

00:03:23.930 --> 00:03:26.180 
for him in some respects i mean
obviously<00:03:24.930> you'd<00:03:25.170> like<00:03:25.380> him<00:03:25.560> to<00:03:25.650> carry<00:03:25.980> your

00:03:26.180 --> 00:03:26.190 
obviously you'd like him to carry your

00:03:26.190 --> 00:03:29.030 
obviously you'd like him to carry your
banner<00:03:26.489> but<00:03:27.299> that's<00:03:27.540> tough<00:03:28.140> to<00:03:28.290> do<00:03:28.440> isn't<00:03:28.680> it<00:03:28.859> i

00:03:29.030 --> 00:03:29.040 
banner but that's tough to do isn't it i

00:03:29.040 --> 00:03:31.610 
banner but that's tough to do isn't it i
think<00:03:30.030> it's<00:03:30.150> very<00:03:30.299> difficult<00:03:30.660> to<00:03:31.109> do<00:03:31.380> but<00:03:31.560> i

00:03:31.610 --> 00:03:31.620 
think it's very difficult to do but i

00:03:31.620 --> 00:03:35.870 
think it's very difficult to do but i
think<00:03:31.920> it's<00:03:32.069> a<00:03:32.220> matter<00:03:32.430> of<00:03:32.609> being<00:03:34.069> a<00:03:35.069> statesman

00:03:35.870 --> 00:03:35.880 
think it's a matter of being a statesman

00:03:35.880 --> 00:03:38.390 
think it's a matter of being a statesman
rather<00:03:36.180> than<00:03:36.480> a<00:03:36.540> garden-variety<00:03:37.400> politician

00:03:38.390 --> 00:03:38.400 
rather than a garden-variety politician

00:03:38.400 --> 00:03:40.699 
rather than a garden-variety politician
i<00:03:38.579> think<00:03:39.510> for<00:03:39.750> example<00:03:39.840> he<00:03:40.230> could<00:03:40.410> have<00:03:40.530> pushed

00:03:40.699 --> 00:03:40.709 
i think for example he could have pushed

00:03:40.709 --> 00:03:42.890 
i think for example he could have pushed
through<00:03:40.950> the<00:03:41.069> public<00:03:41.430> option<00:03:41.609> on<00:03:42.030> the<00:03:42.720> health

00:03:42.890 --> 00:03:42.900 
through the public option on the health

00:03:42.900 --> 00:03:44.360 
through the public option on the health
care<00:03:43.170> system<00:03:43.440> so<00:03:43.799> we<00:03:43.829> wouldn't<00:03:44.160> have<00:03:44.250> the

00:03:44.360 --> 00:03:44.370 
care system so we wouldn't have the

00:03:44.370 --> 00:03:45.770 
care system so we wouldn't have the
pharmaceutical<00:03:45.120> and<00:03:45.269> insurance<00:03:45.720> companies

00:03:45.770 --> 00:03:45.780 
pharmaceutical and insurance companies

00:03:45.780 --> 00:03:48.229 
pharmaceutical and insurance companies
in<00:03:46.350> the<00:03:46.889> driver's<00:03:47.400> seat<00:03:47.430> I<00:03:47.730> think<00:03:47.970> he<00:03:48.060> could

00:03:48.229 --> 00:03:48.239 
in the driver's seat I think he could

00:03:48.239 --> 00:03:50.539 
in the driver's seat I think he could
have<00:03:48.329> used<00:03:48.510> a<00:03:48.690> bully<00:03:48.900> pulpit<00:03:49.769> much<00:03:50.010> better<00:03:50.340> in

to<00:04:11.069> worker<00:04:11.280> so<00:04:11.549> I<00:04:11.609> think<00:04:11.910> yes<00:04:12.660> I<00:04:12.840> know<00:04:12.900> he<00:04:13.200> has

00:04:13.340 --> 00:04:13.350 
to worker so I think yes I know he has

00:04:13.350 --> 00:04:16.129 
to worker so I think yes I know he has
constraints<00:04:14.130> and<00:04:14.250> I<00:04:14.569> have<00:04:15.569> an<00:04:15.660> appreciation

00:04:16.129 --> 00:04:16.139 
constraints and I have an appreciation

00:04:16.139 --> 00:04:17.960 
constraints and I have an appreciation
of<00:04:16.590> him<00:04:16.769> being<00:04:16.979> between<00:04:17.280> a<00:04:17.400> rock<00:04:17.700> and<00:04:17.850> a<00:04:17.940> hard

00:04:17.960 --> 00:04:17.970 
of him being between a rock and a hard

00:04:17.970 --> 00:04:20.449 
of him being between a rock and a hard
place<00:04:18.239> but<00:04:19.019> I<00:04:19.049> just<00:04:19.289> think<00:04:19.410> he<00:04:19.709> hasn't<00:04:20.100> stepped

00:04:20.449 --> 00:04:20.459 
place but I just think he hasn't stepped

00:04:20.459 --> 00:04:22.940 
place but I just think he hasn't stepped
to<00:04:20.760> the<00:04:20.789> plate<00:04:21.090> the<00:04:21.359> way<00:04:21.510> he<00:04:21.659> ought<00:04:21.900> there's<00:04:22.830> a

00:04:22.940 --> 00:04:22.950 
to the plate the way he ought there's a

00:04:22.950 --> 00:04:26.690 
to the plate the way he ought there's a
tendency<00:04:23.370> that<00:04:23.760> he<00:04:24.419> has<00:04:24.630> to<00:04:24.960> a<00:04:24.990> punt<00:04:25.440> on<00:04:25.700> second

00:04:26.690 --> 00:04:26.700 
tendency that he has to a punt on second

00:04:26.700 --> 00:04:27.260 
tendency that he has to a punt on second
down

00:04:27.260 --> 00:04:27.270 
down

00:04:27.270 --> 00:04:29.960 
down
than<00:04:27.569> fourth<00:04:27.960> down<00:04:28.319> well<00:04:28.860> if<00:04:29.430> he<00:04:29.759> wins

00:04:29.960 --> 00:04:29.970 
than fourth down well if he wins

00:04:29.970 --> 00:04:32.330 
than fourth down well if he wins
re-election<00:04:30.830> obviously<00:04:31.830> he<00:04:31.919> doesn't<00:04:32.069> have<00:04:32.250> to

00:04:32.330 --> 00:04:32.340 
re-election obviously he doesn't have to

00:04:32.340 --> 00:04:33.710 
re-election obviously he doesn't have to
worry<00:04:32.550> about<00:04:32.699> another<00:04:33.060> election<00:04:33.419> do<00:04:33.629> you

00:04:33.710 --> 00:04:33.720 
worry about another election do you

00:04:33.720 --> 00:04:34.969 
worry about another election do you
think<00:04:33.900> he<00:04:34.020> tilts<00:04:34.349> more<00:04:34.560> in<00:04:34.680> your<00:04:34.830> direction

00:04:34.969 --> 00:04:34.979 
think he tilts more in your direction

00:04:34.979 --> 00:04:38.300 
think he tilts more in your direction
and<00:04:35.539> also<00:04:36.539> as<00:04:37.139> a<00:04:37.169> follow-up<00:04:37.680> to<00:04:37.860> that<00:04:38.009> because

and also as a follow-up to that because

00:04:38.310 --> 00:04:39.619 
and also as a follow-up to that because
we're<00:04:38.460> just<00:04:38.639> about<00:04:38.759> out<00:04:38.879> of<00:04:39.030> time<00:04:39.300> can<00:04:39.539> he
