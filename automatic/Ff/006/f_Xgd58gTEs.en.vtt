00:01:03.709 --> 00:01:03.719 
much a race fit in my opinion which

00:01:03.719 --> 00:01:05.299 
much a race fit in my opinion which
means<00:01:03.930> it's<00:01:04.049> really<00:01:04.110> tight<00:01:04.650> along<00:01:04.979> the<00:01:05.040> cheek

00:01:05.299 --> 00:01:05.309 
means it's really tight along the cheek

00:01:05.309 --> 00:01:06.950

00:01:08.149 --> 00:01:08.159 
in and out and that's because it is
