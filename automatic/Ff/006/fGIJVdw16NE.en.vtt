able to take it off the runway we've

00:00:38.489 --> 00:00:40.760 
able to take it off the runway we've
taken<00:00:38.790> the<00:00:39.120> fabric<00:00:39.870> and<00:00:40.050> tube<00:00:40.350> construction

taken the fabric and tube construction

00:00:40.770 --> 00:00:43.459 
taken the fabric and tube construction
and<00:00:41.309> we've<00:00:41.430> combined<00:00:41.850> it<00:00:42.030> with<00:00:42.059> technology<00:00:43.050> so

00:00:43.459 --> 00:00:43.469 
and we've combined it with technology so

00:00:43.469 --> 00:00:48.110 
and we've combined it with technology so
that<00:00:43.500> we<00:00:43.649> have<00:00:43.980> in<00:00:44.309> the<00:00:44.489> front<00:00:44.820> see<00:00:45.750> a<00:00:46.520> iPad<00:00:47.520> and

that we have in the front see a iPad and

00:00:48.120 --> 00:00:51.350 
that we have in the front see a iPad and
it's<00:00:48.870> getting<00:00:49.440> its<00:00:49.590> data<00:00:49.920> for<00:00:50.430> engine<00:00:50.969> and

00:00:51.350 --> 00:00:51.360 
it's getting its data for engine and

00:00:51.360 --> 00:00:54.889 
it's getting its data for engine and

00:01:00.480 --> 00:01:03.439 
built-in accelerometers and GPS system
or<00:01:00.600> we<00:01:01.500> have<00:01:01.680> a<00:01:01.710> wireless<00:01:02.460> system<00:01:02.879> built<00:01:03.270> into

or we have a wireless system built into

00:01:03.449 --> 00:01:05.210 
or we have a wireless system built into
the<00:01:03.690> plane<00:01:03.930> that<00:01:04.320> transmit<00:01:04.830> all<00:01:04.949> the

00:01:05.210 --> 00:01:05.220 
the plane that transmit all the

00:01:05.220 --> 00:01:07.370 
the plane that transmit all the
electrical<00:01:06.210> data<00:01:06.390> from<00:01:06.689> the<00:01:06.780> engine<00:01:07.080> so<00:01:07.229> all

00:01:07.370 --> 00:01:07.380 
electrical data from the engine so all

00:01:07.380 --> 00:01:08.840 
electrical data from the engine so all
your<00:01:07.619> engine<00:01:07.830> instruments<00:01:08.310> are<00:01:08.430> showing<00:01:08.729> up

00:01:08.840 --> 00:01:08.850 
your engine instruments are showing up

00:01:08.850 --> 00:01:11.090 
your engine instruments are showing up
on<00:01:09.000> the<00:01:09.090> iPad<00:01:09.450> and<00:01:09.869> then<00:01:10.170> in<00:01:10.560> the<00:01:10.680> back<00:01:10.860> seat

00:01:11.090 --> 00:01:11.100 
on the iPad and then in the back seat

00:01:11.100 --> 00:01:13.039 
on the iPad and then in the back seat
there's<00:01:11.430> an<00:01:11.580> iPhone<00:01:11.880> 4<00:01:12.210> that<00:01:12.600> gets<00:01:12.750> the<00:01:12.840> same

00:01:13.039 --> 00:01:13.049 
there's an iPhone 4 that gets the same

00:01:13.049 --> 00:01:14.660 
there's an iPhone 4 that gets the same
data<00:01:13.290> it's<00:01:13.470> just<00:01:13.530> smaller<00:01:13.920> so<00:01:14.159> the<00:01:14.250> copilot

00:01:14.660 --> 00:01:14.670 
data it's just smaller so the copilot

00:01:14.670 --> 00:01:16.460 
data it's just smaller so the copilot
gets<00:01:14.850> the<00:01:15.030> same<00:01:15.240> display<00:01:15.600> as<00:01:15.750> a<00:01:15.780> pilot<00:01:16.049> the

00:01:16.460 --> 00:01:16.470 
gets the same display as a pilot the

00:01:16.470 --> 00:01:18.740 
gets the same display as a pilot the
basic<00:01:16.830> frame<00:01:17.040> of<00:01:17.159> course<00:01:17.400> is<00:01:17.640> is<00:01:18.060> traditional

00:01:18.740 --> 00:01:18.750 
basic frame of course is is traditional

00:01:18.750 --> 00:01:20.749 
basic frame of course is is traditional
to<00:01:18.960> than<00:01:19.200> fabric<00:01:19.619> it's<00:01:19.770> been<00:01:19.979> beefed<00:01:20.280> up<00:01:20.520> an

to than fabric it's been beefed up an

00:01:20.759 --> 00:01:23.990 
to than fabric it's been beefed up an
additional<00:01:21.380> well<00:01:22.380> points<00:01:22.770> added<00:01:23.100> to<00:01:23.580> handle

00:01:23.990 --> 00:01:24.000 
additional well points added to handle

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:25.609 
additional well points added to handle
the<00:01:24.150> loading<00:01:24.540> as<00:01:24.689> you<00:01:24.840> can<00:01:25.020> see<00:01:25.200> from<00:01:25.409> the

00:01:25.609 --> 00:01:25.619 
the loading as you can see from the

00:01:25.619 --> 00:01:28.070 
the loading as you can see from the
landing<00:01:26.009> gear<00:01:26.250> it's<00:01:26.850> very<00:01:27.150> heavy<00:01:27.390> and<00:01:27.630> has

00:01:28.070 --> 00:01:28.080 
landing gear it's very heavy and has

00:01:28.080 --> 00:01:30.560 
landing gear it's very heavy and has
gussets<00:01:28.560> on<00:01:28.740> it<00:01:28.860> so<00:01:29.369> it's<00:01:29.549> able<00:01:30.090> to<00:01:30.210> handle

00:01:30.560 --> 00:01:30.570 
gussets on it so it's able to handle

00:01:30.570 --> 00:01:33.530 
gussets on it so it's able to handle
side<00:01:31.229> loading<00:01:31.590> and<00:01:31.920> abrupt<00:01:32.670> changes<00:01:33.150> like<00:01:33.509> a
