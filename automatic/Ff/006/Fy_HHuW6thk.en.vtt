00:00:00.110 --> 00:00:02.840
 today of the scheme of options that today I will teach you to 

00:00:02.840 --> 00:00:04.890
 to make a follower platform 

00:00:04.890 --> 00:00:07.130
 like that 

00:00:07.130 --> 00:00:10.509
 if you will allow for example to make a course like this one 

00:00:10.509 --> 00:00:13.579
 for them he is really precise he 

00:00:13.579 --> 00:00:16.579
 I'm in college the spring the asef 

00:00:22.269 --> 00:00:24.839
 a context is far from 

00:00:24.839 --> 00:00:26.960
 then he will go quickly 

00:00:26.960 --> 00:00:29.960
 according to relatives will say it slowly 

00:00:32.900 --> 00:00:34.590
 m 

00:00:34.590 --> 00:00:37.950
 they walk either tightly a moment I produce that I take my time 

00:00:37.950 --> 00:00:40.950
 best 

00:00:43.030 --> 00:00:46.030
 so we do not have much time to play 

00:00:50.110 --> 00:00:53.110
 Christmas 

00:00:55.820 --> 00:00:58.000
 a little 

00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:01.810
 when does week but in fact we find aim 5 will put forward 

00:01:02.710 --> 00:01:05.710
 ridiculous 

00:01:09.860 --> 00:01:12.860
 the couple 

00:01:14.200 --> 00:01:17.650
 so when you see 

00:01:17.650 --> 00:01:19.470
 we see well 

00:01:19.470 --> 00:01:22.140
 which is really accurate if you did not exist far 

00:01:22.140 --> 00:01:25.440
 he will go much faster than his multiples 

00:01:25.440 --> 00:01:28.440
 CarrÃ¨re 

00:01:33.670 --> 00:01:34.910
 there press 

00:01:34.910 --> 00:01:37.150
 inez 

00:01:37.150 --> 00:01:39.400
 so I will teach you how to do it 

00:01:39.400 --> 00:01:42.400
 so it's very very simple to get out 

00:01:43.170 --> 00:01:44.280
 this survey 

00:01:44.280 --> 00:01:48.550
 first month is not nice so push teeth the tennis teacher 

00:01:48.549 --> 00:01:50.960
 congratulate believe that you choose transportation chain 

00:01:50.960 --> 00:01:52.620
 clean transportation 

00:01:52.620 --> 00:01:55.620
 and when you have 

00:01:57.690 --> 00:02:00.490
 in high school in this sense 

00:02:00.490 --> 00:02:02.250
 then in the tools 

00:02:02.250 --> 00:02:03.900
 take umlauts 

00:02:03.900 --> 00:02:07.240
 so I do not assimilate students so this is the case 

00:02:07.240 --> 00:02:10.099
 I think it's much better 

00:02:10.099 --> 00:02:13.219
 so more than the perfect places for leads so you put on the 

00:02:13.219 --> 00:02:15.059
 little white places there 

00:02:15.059 --> 00:02:18.059
 inside 

00:02:19.059 --> 00:02:20.369
 technical 

00:02:20.369 --> 00:02:23.369
 already referred to this as this turnaround 

00:02:24.899 --> 00:02:27.219
 so there already we are at the base 

00:02:27.219 --> 00:02:28.369
 then 

00:02:28.369 --> 00:02:32.749
 no but in his opinion the weight of the south but it is obliged tomato among others 

00:02:32.749 --> 00:02:34.929
 policemen but without more free senses 

00:02:34.929 --> 00:02:38.209
 so now propose a guiding system to move forward 

00:02:38.209 --> 00:02:40.139
 so you will need 

00:02:40.139 --> 00:02:43.139
 so after they won two tufts in two different ways 

00:02:45.199 --> 00:02:48.199
 it was not a chance to receive 

00:02:50.119 --> 00:02:53.089
 either will you put sincere schools 

00:02:53.089 --> 00:02:54.910
 it's up to you 

00:02:54.910 --> 00:02:58.350
 this silence the collective who follow the players if you want to throw on the 

00:02:58.350 --> 00:02:59.669
 laser 

00:02:59.669 --> 00:03:01.159
 so no 

00:03:01.159 --> 00:03:03.779
 Penin I can not wait for every war 

00:03:03.779 --> 00:03:07.269
 while one of 500 flights were well before much better 

00:03:07.269 --> 00:03:08.169
 with 

00:03:08.169 --> 00:03:11.169
 spike xyz and distance on the spot 

00:03:12.559 --> 00:03:15.349
 then what is called moving and moving forward 

00:03:15.349 --> 00:03:17.769
 so if you are part of the three stelae hours 

00:03:17.769 --> 00:03:20.769
 all the substances multiplied the dice 

00:03:22.459 --> 00:03:25.459
 it will take ap on the left 

00:03:26.129 --> 00:03:28.569
 35 years of career 

00:03:28.569 --> 00:03:30.389
 as a holder 

00:03:30.389 --> 00:03:33.389
 like here for example 

00:03:34.809 --> 00:03:37.129
 then political bush 

00:03:37.129 --> 00:03:39.799
 it's on the side 

00:03:39.799 --> 00:03:42.669
 the amazing team drags 

00:03:42.669 --> 00:03:44.199
 this side 

00:03:44.199 --> 00:03:47.199
 at the peak 

00:03:48.699 --> 00:03:51.319
 I am behind 

00:03:51.319 --> 00:03:53.189
 dare to say 

00:03:53.189 --> 00:03:54.329
 it is on this side 

00:03:54.329 --> 00:03:56.489
 in the nineteenth 

00:03:56.489 --> 00:03:59.489
 then we must not forget the syncsort decline 

00:04:00.439 --> 00:04:02.079
 what a known victim 

00:04:02.079 --> 00:04:05.339
 golazo receiver tip you must not forget 

00:04:05.339 --> 00:04:08.579
 a year ago so normally 

00:04:08.579 --> 00:04:11.559
 they kept their word 

00:04:11.559 --> 00:04:14.559
 Earth 

00:04:15.439 --> 00:04:18.439
 is that there is a point to lens 

00:04:23.050 --> 00:04:25.979
 it's now if you stayed close 

00:04:25.979 --> 00:04:27.949
 Well, he'll say it softly 

00:04:27.949 --> 00:04:30.219
 if against you and customs 

00:04:30.219 --> 00:04:33.219
 he will go much faster 

00:04:34.930 --> 00:04:38.370
 so it actually allows you to make a fairly accurate follower platform 

00:04:41.599 --> 00:04:44.689
 so that's with the laser tonnages sold very cubic a train of knowledge 

00:04:45.789 --> 00:04:48.919
 so the weight just that 

00:04:48.919 --> 00:04:50.259
 we will put 

00:04:50.259 --> 00:04:53.729
 I said to the trader stall is still pursuing 

00:04:53.729 --> 00:04:56.509
 while in bankruptcy 

00:04:56.509 --> 00:04:59.650
 but head-to-head 

00:04:59.650 --> 00:05:02.620
 we are going to put the talent throws the country into 

00:05:02.620 --> 00:05:04.419
 cope al-alam 

00:05:04.419 --> 00:05:07.419
 the mi5 symbolic sum of century 

00:05:08.330 --> 00:05:11.139
 m here 

00:05:11.139 --> 00:05:14.139
 here is the work it works 

00:05:15.189 --> 00:05:18.419
 so now I am you 

00:05:18.419 --> 00:05:21.419
 ah here is a pc 

00:05:23.509 --> 00:05:25.690
 as for example doctrinaire 

00:05:25.690 --> 00:05:28.690
 his montreal running mate 

00:05:30.270 --> 00:05:33.270
 he is coming 

00:05:34.379 --> 00:05:37.379
 So, if he works pretty well 

00:05:42.699 --> 00:05:44.830
 after the possible acts 

00:05:44.830 --> 00:05:48.169
 and then like that did not come back eyes and one commented while walking on it 

00:05:48.169 --> 00:05:50.360
 I think for that 

00:05:50.360 --> 00:05:52.439
 these series 

00:05:52.439 --> 00:05:55.550
 good on their percentage speirs that you manage to close it 

00:05:56.719 --> 00:05:58.369
 we go to the next round 

00:05:58.369 --> 00:06:01.979
 the ipad egypt the white-ra laser does rare he believes 

00:06:08.099 --> 00:06:08.919
 next year I can
