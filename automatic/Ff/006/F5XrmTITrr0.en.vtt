00:00:44.300 --> 00:00:49.040
 September I have you two super ideas 

00:00:46.640 --> 00:00:51.379
 easy and delicious and if you are not from 

00:00:49.040 --> 00:00:54.079
 mexico you will learn to make the peak 

00:00:51.379 --> 00:00:55.909
 of the rooster and the guacamole that are sauces 

00:00:54.079 --> 00:00:57.649
 typical and delicious here in mexico 

00:00:55.909 --> 00:01:00.290
 all the dishes that I'm going to show you 

00:00:57.649 --> 00:01:03.860
 to make are some delicious chips with 

00:01:00.290 --> 00:01:07.039
 meat with typical sauce called pico 

00:01:03.860 --> 00:01:09.350
 of rooster and a roll of cream cheese that 

00:01:07.039 --> 00:01:11.119
 It carries within guacamole institutions in 

00:01:09.350 --> 00:01:15.429
 mexico at last you will learn how to 

00:01:11.119 --> 00:01:15.429
 Make the guacamole and let's see how it is done 

00:01:15.550 --> 00:01:20.320
 to make these chips first in a 

00:01:18.160 --> 00:01:22.390
 pan a little oil you are going to put 

00:01:20.320 --> 00:01:24.280
 half an onion and you will not leave 

00:01:22.390 --> 00:01:26.680
 to move when your onion is already 

00:01:24.280 --> 00:01:28.450
 transparent let's put the meat if a 

00:01:26.680 --> 00:01:30.760
 you do not like onions you can omit 

00:01:28.450 --> 00:01:33.280
 this step and you're going to move your flesh 

00:01:30.760 --> 00:01:36.070
 this way these are 500 grams that 

00:01:33.280 --> 00:01:38.230
 approximately yields for 3 people and 

00:01:36.070 --> 00:01:40.780
 now so you know much richer you're going to 

00:01:38.230 --> 00:01:42.570
 put some soy sauce sauce 

00:01:40.780 --> 00:01:44.540
 english 

00:01:42.570 --> 00:01:46.680
 water powder 

00:01:44.540 --> 00:01:48.990
 and salt 

00:01:46.680 --> 00:01:51.090
 but not everything very well until here and 

00:01:48.990 --> 00:01:53.310
 is cooked when finished sewing 

00:01:51.090 --> 00:01:55.260
 let cool for a while to accompany 

00:01:53.310 --> 00:01:57.270
 our totopos with meat we are going to 

00:01:55.260 --> 00:01:58.860
 prepare a pico de gallo for that you're going to 

00:01:57.270 --> 00:02:01.140
 need to diced very 

00:01:58.860 --> 00:02:03.270
 chiquitos a chile morrÃ³n do not be scared 

00:02:01.140 --> 00:02:06.390
 This chili does not bite at all and if not 

00:02:03.270 --> 00:02:09.140
 you know is in this way you are going to cut 

00:02:06.390 --> 00:02:12.870
 equal in small squares a tomato 

00:02:09.140 --> 00:02:15.570
 and a quarter of onion you add the 

00:02:12.870 --> 00:02:17.790
 juice of a lemon a little pepper and 

00:02:15.570 --> 00:02:19.170
 salt to taste to be richer in 

00:02:17.790 --> 00:02:21.750
 the personal thing I like with a 

00:02:19.170 --> 00:02:25.100
 trickle of olive oil 

00:02:21.750 --> 00:02:26.570
 now if you're going to stir everything 

00:02:25.100 --> 00:02:28.250
 you have the ones you like 

00:02:26.570 --> 00:02:29.900
 cymbals spikes can you give us a 

00:02:28.250 --> 00:02:32.090
 little tree chili when you have 

00:02:29.900 --> 00:02:34.190
 list your meat in your pico de gallo now 

00:02:32.090 --> 00:02:36.140
 on a large plate you are going to put a layer 

00:02:34.190 --> 00:02:38.810
 of totopos the tortilla chips are tortillas 

00:02:36.140 --> 00:02:40.880
 turned of these are with salt and without salt 

00:02:38.810 --> 00:02:43.070
 I recommend you to be without salt because 

00:02:40.880 --> 00:02:45.110
 already the meat has enough flavor and everything 

00:02:43.070 --> 00:02:47.870
 I would know very salty now you are going to put 

00:02:45.110 --> 00:02:50.000
 over your flesh over a little bit of 

00:02:47.870 --> 00:02:52.340
 melted cheese in this case I would 

00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:54.320
 I put in La Mancha and finally we 

00:02:52.340 --> 00:02:55.180
 there are our snacks of totopos with 

00:02:54.320 --> 00:02:58.569
 meat 

00:02:55.180 --> 00:02:58.569
 [Music] 

00:02:59.950 --> 00:03:03.879
 this delicious first let's start 

00:03:01.930 --> 00:03:06.400
 preparing the filling that is a rich 

00:03:03.879 --> 00:03:08.290
 guacamole let's use an avocado that 

00:03:06.400 --> 00:03:10.330
 be mature that means that this 

00:03:08.290 --> 00:03:12.519
 negrito of this part I am the difference 

00:03:10.330 --> 00:03:14.739
 this is a ripe avocado and this is not 

00:03:12.519 --> 00:03:17.050
 This is a little greener among more 

00:03:14.739 --> 00:03:18.819
 negrito is better let's take the 

00:03:17.050 --> 00:03:20.380
 shell the avocado and we will put it 

00:03:18.819 --> 00:03:21.910
 on a plate there are many ways to 

00:03:20.380 --> 00:03:24.099
 prepare guacamole but my way 

00:03:21.910 --> 00:03:25.900
 favorite is this besides the guacamole 

00:03:24.099 --> 00:03:27.730
 it is harder and for the roll 

00:03:25.900 --> 00:03:29.860
 We need him to be hard because if not 

00:03:27.730 --> 00:03:32.140
 you can go out with a fork you're going to 

00:03:29.860 --> 00:03:34.420
 crush the avocado among more mature 

00:03:32.140 --> 00:03:36.580
 This step is going to be easier and 

00:03:34.420 --> 00:03:38.890
 that you've crushed while watching avocado 

00:03:36.580 --> 00:03:40.630
 to add the juice of a lemon and 

00:03:38.890 --> 00:03:43.180
 add some coriander finely 

00:03:40.630 --> 00:03:45.220
 chopped and it's not a full guacamole 

00:03:43.180 --> 00:03:47.380
 but a little chili I'm going to put 

00:03:45.220 --> 00:03:49.660
 Serrano chile slices you can 

00:03:47.380 --> 00:03:51.280
 put him as a serrano or a tree if he does not 

00:03:49.660 --> 00:03:53.709
 like the spicy do not worry you can 

00:03:51.280 --> 00:03:56.650
 omit it and still it tastes delicious and what 

00:03:53.709 --> 00:03:58.720
 add to our guacamole 

00:03:56.650 --> 00:04:01.239
 finally put a little salt to taste 

00:03:58.720 --> 00:04:03.159
 come, it's super easy to make guacamole and 

00:04:01.239 --> 00:04:05.700
 it tastes delicious then you're going to open a 

00:04:03.159 --> 00:04:09.040
 clean bag so that you stay like this 

00:04:05.700 --> 00:04:10.959
 on top of the bag you are going to put a bar 

00:04:09.040 --> 00:04:12.819
 of cream cheese and you're going to cover it like that 

00:04:10.959 --> 00:04:14.769
 Now with a roller you're starting to 

00:04:12.819 --> 00:04:16.750
 expand your cream cheese the cheese has 

00:04:14.769 --> 00:04:19.030
 to be as cold as possible to take care of 

00:04:16.750 --> 00:04:20.799
 be matched do not leave it too thin 

00:04:19.030 --> 00:04:22.780
 more or less the width has to be the 

00:04:20.799 --> 00:04:24.729
 half of your little finger since you have 

00:04:22.780 --> 00:04:26.780
 your cheese tortilla you are going to remove the 

00:04:24.729 --> 00:04:30.760
 plastic with care 

00:04:26.780 --> 00:04:30.760
 and you're going to put your guacamole 

00:04:32.370 --> 00:04:37.410
 Now you 're going to roll it up, you 're going to win the 

00:04:34.740 --> 00:04:41.770
 tip your bag and you're gonna start 

00:04:37.410 --> 00:04:45.250
 fold then you are going to remove the plastic 

00:04:41.770 --> 00:04:46.750
 and you are going to double again as there 

00:04:45.250 --> 00:04:49.150
 your roll is going to put the 

00:04:46.750 --> 00:04:51.310
 freezer for 15 minutes as there 

00:04:49.150 --> 00:04:53.710
 removed your roll from the freezer in a 

00:04:51.310 --> 00:04:56.400
 dish with a bit of sesame and fountain 

00:04:53.710 --> 00:04:56.400
 Roll over 

00:04:58.650 --> 00:05:03.660
 finally powder in a dish to 

00:05:00.600 --> 00:05:06.000
 serve it and that's the way we have left our 

00:05:03.660 --> 00:05:08.490
 snacks for a Mexican night 

00:05:06.000 --> 00:05:08.990

 they are to be a recipient with meat and 

00:05:31.630 --> 00:05:35.170

00:05:33.370 --> 00:05:37.840
