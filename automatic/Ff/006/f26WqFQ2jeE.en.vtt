00:00:08.019 --> 00:00:12.230
 hello i am already part of samsung and 

00:00:10.970 --> 00:00:15.320
 you where I changed my mind today 

00:00:12.230 --> 00:00:16.970
 christmas 2010 no uno imagine 

00:00:15.320 --> 00:00:19.100
 we are on our roadshow in 

00:00:16.970 --> 00:00:21.960
 frankfurt today for the first time also 

00:00:19.100 --> 00:00:24.300
 actually show in germany 

00:00:21.960 --> 00:00:27.859
 we have the hd monitor for the first time 

00:00:24.300 --> 00:00:30.480
 at the beginning of the year on the 

00:00:27.859 --> 00:00:32.070
 however, then that was the whole thing 

00:00:30.480 --> 00:00:33.690
 more number concept was 

00:00:32.070 --> 00:00:35.940
 We could not talk that much about that yet 

00:00:33.690 --> 00:00:39.410
 The technical details were last 

00:00:35.940 --> 00:00:39.410
 betrayed more year 

00:00:44.860 --> 00:00:51.170
 the monitor with one that is 

00:00:49.190 --> 00:00:52.940
 I'm still looking for the content of the moment 

00:00:51.170 --> 00:00:56.600
 a bit but no problem at all 

00:00:52.940 --> 00:00:58.870
 even the hd content will be here 

00:00:56.600 --> 00:01:00.910
 the quality on nigeria 

00:00:58.870 --> 00:01:02.890
 besides the resolution we have 

00:01:00.910 --> 00:01:04.479
 still provides a second factor for 

00:01:02.890 --> 00:01:06.970
 is the image looks as nice as it 

00:01:04.479 --> 00:01:08.590
 this is the fact that the fact that 

00:01:06.970 --> 00:01:11.350
 the monitor a billion colors 

00:01:08.590 --> 00:01:15.009
 which is 60 times more than that 

00:01:11.350 --> 00:01:16.930
 usual 60.7 million yes there sees 

00:01:15.009 --> 00:01:18.820
 you actually differed in the end 

00:01:16.930 --> 00:01:21.920
 and the picture is really intense 

00:01:18.820 --> 00:01:23.869
 and above all reality 

00:01:21.920 --> 00:01:27.170
 from the connections her becomes the monitor 

00:01:23.869 --> 00:01:28.310
 get ahead with two years and me 

00:01:27.170 --> 00:01:29.869
 if I want the same 

00:01:28.310 --> 00:01:32.119
 possibility two to the player 

00:01:29.869 --> 00:01:34.340
 So connect about a pc and a 

00:01:32.119 --> 00:01:37.000
 rock pop and both content simultaneously 

00:01:34.340 --> 00:01:38.830
 on screen display 

00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:40.780
 then it's good that we actually 

00:01:38.830 --> 00:01:42.430
 think that the monitor is very interesting 

00:01:40.780 --> 00:01:45.140
 is for all people who like movies 

00:01:42.430 --> 00:01:47.600
 monitor or look on specially 

00:01:45.140 --> 00:01:50.270
 we have very very fast reaction 

00:01:47.600 --> 00:01:52.490
 of a millisecond that means I have 

00:01:50.270 --> 00:01:54.240
 a real tens can also be here 

00:01:52.490 --> 00:01:57.010
 Pictures or no ghost 

00:01:54.240 --> 00:01:59.680
 especially for gamers should also still 

00:01:57.010 --> 00:02:01.900
 the game mode ie here I have the 

00:01:59.680 --> 00:02:04.090
 possibility me in my game very much 

00:02:01.900 --> 00:02:06.220
 dark is foggy or blurred 

00:02:04.090 --> 00:02:10.149
 still the whole mess 

00:02:06.220 --> 00:02:11.890
 displayed are very detailed yes what 

00:02:10.149 --> 00:02:13.810
 Of course it is also interesting and 

00:02:11.890 --> 00:02:16.690
 important to know when will the monsoon come 

00:02:13.810 --> 00:02:18.160

00:02:16.690 --> 00:02:20.730

00:02:18.160 --> 00:02:20.730
