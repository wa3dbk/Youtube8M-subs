okay<00:00:06.779> and<00:00:07.560> what<00:00:07.710> we'll<00:00:07.859> see<00:00:08.900> on<00:00:09.900> the<00:00:10.620> image<00:00:10.920> is

00:00:11.299 --> 00:00:11.309 
okay and what we'll see on the image is

00:00:11.309 --> 00:00:12.950 
okay and what we'll see on the image is
we'll<00:00:11.519> definitely<00:00:11.820> see<00:00:12.179> an<00:00:12.389> ability<00:00:12.750> to

00:00:12.950 --> 00:00:12.960 
we'll definitely see an ability to

00:00:12.960 --> 00:00:15.499 
we'll definitely see an ability to
redistribute<00:00:13.620> that<00:00:13.769> pressure<00:00:14.190> now<00:00:14.820> with<00:00:15.360> the

00:00:15.499 --> 00:00:15.509 
redistribute that pressure now with the

00:00:15.509 --> 00:00:17.960 
redistribute that pressure now with the
adjustment<00:00:16.080> process<00:00:16.340> this<00:00:17.340> is<00:00:17.520> where<00:00:17.730> in

00:00:17.960 --> 00:00:17.970 
adjustment process this is where in

00:00:17.970 --> 00:00:20.300 
adjustment process this is where in
pressure<00:00:18.600> imaging<00:00:19.109> we<00:00:19.260> can<00:00:19.439> really<00:00:19.710> tell<00:00:20.010> that

00:00:20.300 --> 00:00:20.310 
pressure imaging we can really tell that

00:00:20.310 --> 00:00:21.769 
pressure imaging we can really tell that
we<00:00:20.880> have<00:00:21.029> a<00:00:21.060> lot<00:00:21.359> of<00:00:21.390> this<00:00:21.630> you<00:00:21.750> know

00:00:21.769 --> 00:00:21.779 
we have a lot of this you know

00:00:21.779 --> 00:00:24.679 
we have a lot of this you know
tuberosity<00:00:22.560> area<00:00:22.949> that's<00:00:23.640> showing<00:00:24.029> up<00:00:24.180> but

00:00:24.679 --> 00:00:24.689 
tuberosity area that's showing up but

00:00:24.689 --> 00:00:27.170 
tuberosity area that's showing up but
not<00:00:24.900> much<00:00:25.260> femoral<00:00:26.099> support<00:00:26.550> so<00:00:26.970> we're<00:00:27.090> going

00:00:27.170 --> 00:00:27.180 
not much femoral support so we're going

00:00:27.180 --> 00:00:29.330 
not much femoral support so we're going
to<00:00:27.269> want<00:00:27.480> to<00:00:27.599> change<00:00:27.810> that<00:00:28.170> by<00:00:28.710> doing<00:00:28.769> a<00:00:29.130> little

00:00:29.330 --> 00:00:29.340 
to want to change that by doing a little

00:00:29.340 --> 00:00:30.830 
to want to change that by doing a little
bit<00:00:29.519> of<00:00:29.550> modification<00:00:29.939> or<00:00:30.510> your<00:00:30.630> seat

00:00:30.830 --> 00:00:30.840 
bit of modification or your seat

00:00:30.840 --> 00:00:34.069 
bit of modification or your seat
position<00:00:31.289> well<00:00:31.830> we<00:00:31.949> may<00:00:32.130> do<00:00:32.189> is<00:00:32.640> we<00:00:33.600> may<00:00:33.780> use

00:00:34.069 --> 00:00:34.079 
position well we may do is we may use

00:00:34.079 --> 00:00:36.080 
position well we may do is we may use
just<00:00:34.350> some<00:00:34.530> things<00:00:34.770> laying<00:00:35.010> around<00:00:35.130> your<00:00:35.520> your

00:00:36.080 --> 00:00:36.090 
just some things laying around your your

00:00:36.090 --> 00:00:39.170 
just some things laying around your your
clinic<00:00:36.450> to<00:00:36.899> change<00:00:37.399> foot<00:00:38.399> height<00:00:38.610> instead<00:00:39.090> of

00:00:39.170 --> 00:00:39.180 
clinic to change foot height instead of

00:00:39.180 --> 00:00:41.569 
clinic to change foot height instead of
getting<00:00:39.450> tools<00:00:39.719> out<00:00:39.960> we<00:00:40.860> may<00:00:41.010> just<00:00:41.250> want<00:00:41.430> to

00:00:41.569 --> 00:00:41.579 
getting tools out we may just want to

00:00:41.579 --> 00:00:43.850 
getting tools out we may just want to
see<00:00:41.730> how<00:00:41.940> does<00:00:42.120> this<00:00:42.300> change<00:00:42.360> our<00:00:43.079> pressure

00:00:43.850 --> 00:00:43.860 
see how does this change our pressure

00:00:43.860 --> 00:00:46.580 
see how does this change our pressure
mapping<00:00:44.190> and<00:00:44.579> as<00:00:45.239> you'll<00:00:45.450> see<00:00:45.690> we've<00:00:46.320> changed

00:00:46.580 --> 00:00:46.590 
mapping and as you'll see we've changed

00:00:46.590 --> 00:00:50.060 
mapping and as you'll see we've changed
the<00:00:46.800> image<00:00:46.950> very<00:00:47.850> substantially<00:00:48.660> from<00:00:49.070> mainly

00:00:50.060 --> 00:00:50.070 
the image very substantially from mainly

00:00:50.070 --> 00:00:52.130 
the image very substantially from mainly
issue<00:00:50.250> area<00:00:50.820> now<00:00:51.239> we<00:00:51.300> have<00:00:51.600> good<00:00:51.840> femoral

00:00:52.130 --> 00:00:52.140 
issue area now we have good femoral

00:00:52.140 --> 00:00:54.590 
issue area now we have good femoral
support<00:00:52.680> and<00:00:52.890> that's<00:00:53.760> just<00:00:53.879> something<00:00:54.059> we<00:00:54.449> may

00:00:54.590 --> 00:00:54.600 
support and that's just something we may

00:00:54.600 --> 00:00:56.240 
support and that's just something we may
want<00:00:54.780> to<00:00:54.899> do<00:00:55.020> when<00:00:55.170> we<00:00:55.199> adjust<00:00:55.680> this<00:00:55.800> product

00:00:56.240 --> 00:00:56.250 
want to do when we adjust this product

00:00:56.250 --> 00:01:02.060 
want to do when we adjust this product
for<00:00:57.030> a<00:00:57.090> final<00:00:57.390> fitting<00:00:59.059> again<00:01:00.710> we're<00:01:01.710> going<00:01:01.859> to

00:01:02.060 --> 00:01:02.070 
for a final fitting again we're going to

00:01:02.070 --> 00:01:05.030 
for a final fitting again we're going to
do<00:01:02.250> a<00:01:02.750> preview<00:01:03.750> for<00:01:03.809> about<00:01:04.170> eight<00:01:04.439> minutes<00:01:04.650> and

00:01:05.030 --> 00:01:05.040 
do a preview for about eight minutes and

00:01:05.040 --> 00:01:07.160 
do a preview for about eight minutes and
then<00:01:05.850> the<00:01:05.970> final<00:01:06.210> two<00:01:06.510> minutes<00:01:06.689> we'll<00:01:06.990> hit

00:01:07.160 --> 00:01:07.170 
then the final two minutes we'll hit

00:01:07.170 --> 00:01:10.550 
then the final two minutes we'll hit
record<00:01:07.650> and<00:01:08.780> we're<00:01:09.780> going<00:01:09.930> to<00:01:09.960> want<00:01:10.170> to<00:01:10.260> record

00:01:10.550 --> 00:01:10.560 
record and we're going to want to record

00:01:10.560 --> 00:01:12.620 
record and we're going to want to record
this<00:01:10.770> data<00:01:11.040> why<00:01:11.640> do<00:01:11.700> we<00:01:11.880> do<00:01:12.030> at<00:01:12.150> eight<00:01:12.270> minutes

00:01:12.620 --> 00:01:12.630 
this data why do we do at eight minutes

00:01:12.630 --> 00:01:14.570 
this data why do we do at eight minutes
it's<00:01:13.380> very<00:01:13.530> important<00:01:13.950> to<00:01:14.010> do<00:01:14.189> it<00:01:14.280> for<00:01:14.430> eight

00:01:14.570 --> 00:01:14.580 
it's very important to do it for eight

00:01:14.580 --> 00:01:17.420 
it's very important to do it for eight
minutes<00:01:14.850> because<00:01:15.320> we<00:01:16.320> want<00:01:16.560> to<00:01:16.740> see<00:01:16.920> how<00:01:17.130> this

00:01:17.420 --> 00:01:17.430 
minutes because we want to see how this

have with all our sessions consistency
is<00:02:10.340> crucial<00:02:10.759> so<00:02:10.880> again<00:02:11.180> we're<00:02:11.360> going<00:02:11.510> to<00:02:11.600> do

00:02:11.710 --> 00:02:11.720 
is crucial so again we're going to do

00:02:11.720 --> 00:02:13.810 
is crucial so again we're going to do
eight<00:02:11.930> minutes<00:02:12.260> of<00:02:12.380> pre-record<00:02:12.980> and<00:02:13.250> then

00:02:13.810 --> 00:02:13.820 
eight minutes of pre-record and then

00:02:13.820 --> 00:02:15.699 
eight minutes of pre-record and then
after<00:02:14.150> that<00:02:14.180> we're<00:02:14.480> going<00:02:14.600> to<00:02:14.780> do<00:02:14.959> two<00:02:15.530> minutes

00:02:15.699 --> 00:02:15.709 
after that we're going to do two minutes

00:02:15.709 --> 00:02:18.250 
after that we're going to do two minutes
of<00:02:16.060> record<00:02:17.060> mode<00:02:17.300> so<00:02:17.600> that<00:02:17.630> now<00:02:17.900> we<00:02:17.930> can

00:02:18.250 --> 00:02:18.260 
of record mode so that now we can

00:02:18.260 --> 00:02:21.040 
of record mode so that now we can
compare<00:02:18.380> data<00:02:18.739> at<00:02:19.070> the<00:02:19.580> end<00:02:19.820> of<00:02:20.209> the<00:02:20.840> ten

00:03:04.720 --> 00:03:04.730 
is going to be most appropriate so we

00:03:04.730 --> 00:03:08.050 
is going to be most appropriate so we
prescribed<00:03:05.269> the<00:03:05.480> right<00:03:05.630> product<00:03:06.820> the<00:03:07.820> first

00:03:14.199 --> 00:03:14.209 
where our peak pressure areas are what

00:03:14.209 --> 00:03:16.240 
where our peak pressure areas are what
we've<00:03:14.360> done<00:03:14.570> with<00:03:14.780> this<00:03:14.959> medical<00:03:15.530> software<00:03:15.739> is

00:03:16.240 --> 00:03:16.250 
we've done with this medical software is

00:03:16.250 --> 00:03:18.430 
we've done with this medical software is
we've<00:03:16.730> highlighted<00:03:16.970> that<00:03:17.390> area<00:03:17.720> with<00:03:18.290> the

00:03:18.430 --> 00:03:18.440 
we've highlighted that area with the

00:03:18.440 --> 00:03:20.440 
we've highlighted that area with the

cursor done a right click on the
computer<00:03:20.900> and<00:03:21.049> then<00:03:21.620> gotten<00:03:22.010> our<00:03:22.220> numeric

00:03:22.810 --> 00:03:22.820 
computer and then gotten our numeric

00:03:22.820 --> 00:03:24.789 
computer and then gotten our numeric
value<00:03:23.269> for<00:03:23.510> the<00:03:23.600> nine<00:03:23.840> sensors<00:03:24.410> that<00:03:24.560> are<00:03:24.620> in

00:03:24.789 --> 00:03:24.799 
value for the nine sensors that are in

00:03:24.799 --> 00:03:26.800 
value for the nine sensors that are in
that<00:03:24.950> area<00:03:25.130> what<00:03:25.700> that<00:03:25.880> does<00:03:26.090> is<00:03:26.120> gives<00:03:26.510> us<00:03:26.690> a

00:03:26.800 --> 00:03:26.810 
that area what that does is gives us a

00:03:26.810 --> 00:03:28.630 
that area what that does is gives us a
good<00:03:26.989> idea<00:03:27.170> of<00:03:27.560> what<00:03:27.950> the<00:03:28.070> pressure<00:03:28.280> gradient

00:03:28.630 --> 00:03:28.640 
good idea of what the pressure gradient

00:03:28.640 --> 00:03:31.030 
good idea of what the pressure gradient
is<00:03:29.150> so<00:03:29.870> we'll<00:03:30.019> see<00:03:30.170> higher<00:03:30.380> pressures<00:03:30.860> to

00:03:31.030 --> 00:03:31.040 
is so we'll see higher pressures to

00:03:31.040 --> 00:03:33.009 
is so we'll see higher pressures to
lower<00:03:31.190> pressures<00:03:31.700> and<00:03:31.850> also<00:03:32.450> an<00:03:32.690> average

00:03:33.009 --> 00:03:33.019 
lower pressures and also an average

00:03:33.019 --> 00:03:35.470 
lower pressures and also an average
pressure<00:03:33.260> and<00:03:33.799> you'll<00:03:34.040> see<00:03:34.250> that<00:03:34.280> on<00:03:34.610> our<00:03:34.850> 2nd

00:03:35.470 --> 00:03:35.480 
pressure and you'll see that on our 2nd

00:03:35.480 --> 00:03:38.380 
pressure and you'll see that on our 2nd
cushion<00:03:36.280> much<00:03:37.280> less<00:03:37.549> pressure<00:03:37.760> gradient

00:03:38.380 --> 00:03:38.390 
cushion much less pressure gradient

00:03:38.390 --> 00:03:42.069 
cushion much less pressure gradient
lower<00:03:39.170> average<00:03:39.440> pressure<00:03:39.910> then<00:03:40.910> lastly<00:03:41.299> the

00:03:42.069 --> 00:03:42.079 
lower average pressure then lastly the

00:03:42.079 --> 00:03:43.440 
lower average pressure then lastly the
3rd<00:03:42.290> cushion<00:03:42.530> again

00:03:43.440 --> 00:03:43.450 
3rd cushion again

00:03:43.450 --> 00:03:46.020 
3rd cushion again
very<00:03:44.260> low<00:03:44.500> gradients<00:03:45.160> very<00:03:45.640> low<00:03:45.849> average

00:03:46.020 --> 00:03:46.030 
very low gradients very low average

00:03:46.030 --> 00:03:47.910 
very low gradients very low average
pressure<00:03:46.420> and<00:03:46.810> that's<00:03:47.319> what<00:03:47.500> we're<00:03:47.620> looking

00:03:47.910 --> 00:03:47.920 
pressure and that's what we're looking

00:03:47.920 --> 00:03:50.400 
pressure and that's what we're looking
for<00:03:47.950> when<00:03:48.280> we<00:03:48.430> really<00:03:49.060> want<00:03:49.239> to<00:03:49.330> analyze<00:03:49.870> where

00:03:50.400 --> 00:03:50.410 
for when we really want to analyze where

00:03:50.410 --> 00:03:52.320 
for when we really want to analyze where
the<00:03:50.560> peak<00:03:50.800> pressures<00:03:51.280> are<00:03:51.459> and<00:03:51.730> the<00:03:51.879> gradients

00:03:52.320 --> 00:03:52.330 
the peak pressures are and the gradients

00:03:52.330 --> 00:03:54.720 
the peak pressures are and the gradients
have<00:03:52.420> followed<00:03:52.800> the<00:03:53.800> second<00:03:54.190> key<00:03:54.310> element

00:03:54.720 --> 00:03:54.730 
have followed the second key element

00:03:54.730 --> 00:03:56.520 
have followed the second key element
we're<00:03:54.879> most<00:03:55.060> concerned<00:03:55.480> with<00:03:55.569> is<00:03:55.959> contact

00:03:56.520 --> 00:03:56.530 
we're most concerned with is contact

00:03:56.530 --> 00:03:59.610 
we're most concerned with is contact
area<00:03:56.920> you<00:03:57.670> can<00:03:57.849> visually<00:03:58.330> analyze<00:03:58.870> the

00:03:59.610 --> 00:03:59.620 
area you can visually analyze the

00:03:59.620 --> 00:04:02.130 
area you can visually analyze the
comparison<00:04:00.250> mode<00:04:00.430> and<00:04:00.730> look<00:04:01.420> at<00:04:01.599> which<00:04:01.900> one

00:04:02.130 --> 00:04:02.140 
comparison mode and look at which one

00:04:02.140 --> 00:04:05.070 
comparison mode and look at which one
has<00:04:02.530> more<00:04:02.860> contact<00:04:03.640> area<00:04:04.000> the<00:04:04.450> greater<00:04:04.840> the

00:04:05.070 --> 00:04:05.080 
has more contact area the greater the

00:04:05.080 --> 00:04:07.559 
has more contact area the greater the
contact<00:04:05.590> area<00:04:05.769> the<00:04:06.400> better<00:04:06.640> it<00:04:06.849> is<00:04:06.970> because<00:04:07.239> we

00:04:07.559 --> 00:04:07.569
