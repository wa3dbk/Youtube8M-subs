a product the preserve in this case jam

00:00:59.879 --> 00:01:02.330 
a product the preserve in this case jam
you<00:01:00.329> put<00:01:00.480> it<00:01:00.539> in<00:01:00.570> a<00:01:00.629> jar<00:01:00.809> you<00:01:01.500> seal<00:01:01.710> it<00:01:01.739> you

00:01:02.330 --> 00:01:02.340 
you put it in a jar you seal it you

00:01:02.340 --> 00:01:04.759 
you put it in a jar you seal it you
process<00:01:02.910> this<00:01:03.210> sealed<00:01:03.719> jar<00:01:04.049> in<00:01:04.290> a<00:01:04.470> boiling

00:01:04.759 --> 00:01:04.769 
process this sealed jar in a boiling

00:01:04.769 --> 00:01:07.370 
process this sealed jar in a boiling
water<00:01:04.799> bath<00:01:05.040> and<00:01:05.510> that<00:01:06.510> processing<00:01:07.200> is

00:01:07.370 --> 00:01:07.380 
water bath and that processing is

00:01:07.380 --> 00:01:09.530 
water bath and that processing is
essentially<00:01:08.070> a<00:01:08.100> pasteurization<00:01:08.939> process<00:01:08.970> and

00:01:09.530 --> 00:01:09.540 
essentially a pasteurization process and

00:01:09.540 --> 00:01:14.030 
essentially a pasteurization process and
then<00:01:10.080> that<00:01:10.439> jar<00:01:10.770> is<00:01:11.310> safe<00:01:11.640> and<00:01:12.290> stable<00:01:13.290> for

00:01:14.030 --> 00:01:14.040 
then that jar is safe and stable for

00:01:14.040 --> 00:01:15.830 
then that jar is safe and stable for
shelf<00:01:14.220> storage<00:01:14.460> for<00:01:15.030> up<00:01:15.180> to<00:01:15.299> a<00:01:15.330> year<00:01:15.390> so<00:01:15.750> how

00:01:15.830 --> 00:01:15.840 
shelf storage for up to a year so how

00:01:15.840 --> 00:01:17.810 
shelf storage for up to a year so how
difficult<00:01:16.320> is<00:01:16.439> it<00:01:16.470> to<00:01:16.590> get<00:01:16.799> started<00:01:17.070> I<00:01:17.400> mean<00:01:17.430> it

00:01:17.810 --> 00:01:17.820 
difficult is it to get started I mean it

00:01:17.820 --> 00:01:20.179 
difficult is it to get started I mean it
seems<00:01:18.060> pretty<00:01:18.479> basic<00:01:18.750> but<00:01:19.080> home<00:01:19.650> canning<00:01:19.950> is

00:01:20.179 --> 00:01:20.189 
seems pretty basic but home canning is

00:01:20.189 --> 00:01:21.649 
seems pretty basic but home canning is
just<00:01:20.369> home<00:01:20.520> cooking<00:01:20.850> by<00:01:20.970> another<00:01:21.180> name<00:01:21.390> and
