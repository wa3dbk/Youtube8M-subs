Velarde welcome back to the show thank

00:00:23.220 --> 00:00:25.970 
Velarde welcome back to the show thank
you<00:00:23.340> first<00:00:23.970> of<00:00:24.119> all<00:00:24.240> explain<00:00:24.449> what<00:00:25.350> diabetes

00:00:25.970 --> 00:00:25.980 
you first of all explain what diabetes

00:00:25.980 --> 00:00:29.509 
you first of all explain what diabetes
is<00:00:26.599> diabetes<00:00:27.599> is<00:00:28.019> actually<00:00:28.590> high<00:00:28.920> blood<00:00:29.220> sugar

00:00:29.509 --> 00:00:29.519 
is diabetes is actually high blood sugar

00:00:29.519 --> 00:00:32.240 
is diabetes is actually high blood sugar
and<00:00:29.929> if<00:00:30.929> you<00:00:31.109> think<00:00:31.349> of<00:00:31.529> the<00:00:31.710> blood<00:00:31.949> sugar

00:00:32.240 --> 00:00:32.250 
and if you think of the blood sugar

00:00:32.250 --> 00:00:34.190 
and if you think of the blood sugar
that's<00:00:32.489> the<00:00:32.700> actual<00:00:33.149> energy<00:00:33.390> source<00:00:33.930> of<00:00:34.140> the

00:00:34.190 --> 00:00:34.200 
that's the actual energy source of the

00:00:34.200 --> 00:00:35.630 
that's the actual energy source of the
body<00:00:34.380> that's<00:00:34.680> what<00:00:34.829> makes<00:00:35.040> the<00:00:35.219> body<00:00:35.340> work

00:00:35.630 --> 00:00:35.640 
body that's what makes the body work

00:00:35.640 --> 00:00:38.750 
body that's what makes the body work
very<00:00:36.270> naturally<00:00:36.780> and<00:00:36.960> healthy<00:00:37.370> but<00:00:38.370> if<00:00:38.579> the

00:00:38.750 --> 00:00:38.760 
very naturally and healthy but if the

00:00:38.760 --> 00:00:40.610 
very naturally and healthy but if the
blood<00:00:38.910> sugar<00:00:39.030> doesn't<00:00:39.510> get<00:00:39.899> from<00:00:40.260> the<00:00:40.379> blood

00:00:40.610 --> 00:00:40.620 
blood sugar doesn't get from the blood

00:00:40.620 --> 00:00:43.340 
blood sugar doesn't get from the blood
vessels<00:00:41.040> into<00:00:41.610> your<00:00:41.790> body<00:00:41.969> then<00:00:42.899> we<00:00:43.110> lose<00:00:43.320> that

00:00:43.340 --> 00:00:43.350 
vessels into your body then we lose that

00:00:43.350 --> 00:00:45.440 
vessels into your body then we lose that
energy<00:00:43.680> source<00:00:44.160> and<00:00:44.399> what<00:00:44.760> allows<00:00:44.879> that<00:00:45.390> to

00:00:45.440 --> 00:00:45.450 
energy source and what allows that to

00:00:45.450 --> 00:00:48.319 
energy source and what allows that to
happen<00:00:45.600> is<00:00:46.020> insulin<00:00:46.410> and<00:00:47.160> so<00:00:47.640> how<00:00:47.820> many<00:00:48.030> people

00:00:48.319 --> 00:00:48.329 
happen is insulin and so how many people

00:00:48.329 --> 00:00:50.090 
happen is insulin and so how many people
are<00:00:48.450> affected<00:00:48.629> by<00:00:48.930> diabetes<00:00:48.989> in<00:00:49.559> this<00:00:49.680> country

00:00:50.090 --> 00:00:50.100 
are affected by diabetes in this country

00:00:50.100 --> 00:00:52.670 
are affected by diabetes in this country
well<00:00:50.719> 23<00:00:51.719> million<00:00:51.930> people<00:00:52.320> have<00:00:52.469> diabetes

00:00:52.670 --> 00:00:52.680 
well 23 million people have diabetes

00:00:52.680 --> 00:00:55.310 
well 23 million people have diabetes
what<00:00:53.280> I<00:00:53.520> find<00:00:53.850> interesting<00:00:54.149> is<00:00:54.570> that<00:00:54.930> the

00:00:55.310 --> 00:00:55.320 
what I find interesting is that the

00:00:55.320 --> 00:00:57.080 
what I find interesting is that the
American<00:00:55.770> diabetic<00:00:56.250> Association<00:00:56.520> estimates

00:00:57.080 --> 00:00:57.090 
American diabetic Association estimates

00:00:57.090 --> 00:00:59.150 
American diabetic Association estimates
that<00:00:57.539> there's<00:00:57.780> six<00:00:57.989> million<00:00:58.260> people<00:00:58.770> walking

00:00:59.150 --> 00:00:59.160 
that there's six million people walking

00:00:59.160 --> 00:01:01.400 
that there's six million people walking
around<00:00:59.250> that<00:00:59.699> are<00:01:00.059> diabetics<00:01:00.809> that<00:01:00.870> don't

00:01:01.400 --> 00:01:01.410 
around that are diabetics that don't

00:01:01.410 --> 00:01:03.740 
around that are diabetics that don't
know<00:01:01.530> it<00:01:01.710> and<00:01:01.859> that<00:01:01.920> there's<00:01:02.789> about<00:01:02.969> twenty

00:01:03.740 --> 00:01:03.750 
know it and that there's about twenty

00:01:03.750 --> 00:01:05.240 
know it and that there's about twenty
forty<00:01:04.530> million<00:01:04.710> people<00:01:04.830> that<00:01:05.189> are

very alarming and now what is the

00:01:22.830 --> 00:01:24.980 
very alarming and now what is the
connection<00:01:23.250> then<00:01:23.670> between<00:01:24.180> gum<00:01:24.570> disease<00:01:24.600> and

00:01:24.980 --> 00:01:24.990 
connection then between gum disease and

00:01:24.990 --> 00:01:27.830 
connection then between gum disease and
diabetes<00:01:25.850> well<00:01:26.850> they<00:01:27.030> actually<00:01:27.210> are<00:01:27.659> both

00:01:27.830 --> 00:01:27.840 
diabetes well they actually are both

00:01:27.840 --> 00:01:30.020 
diabetes well they actually are both
chronic<00:01:28.350> diseases<00:01:28.680> and<00:01:29.009> they<00:01:29.310> both<00:01:29.549> make<00:01:29.850> each

00:01:30.020 --> 00:01:30.030 
chronic diseases and they both make each

00:01:30.030 --> 00:01:33.080 
chronic diseases and they both make each
other<00:01:30.270> worse<00:01:30.920> Purdon's<00:01:31.920> EES<00:01:32.189> makes<00:01:32.460> diabetes

00:01:33.080 --> 00:01:33.090 
other worse Purdon's EES makes diabetes

00:01:33.090 --> 00:01:35.090 
other worse Purdon's EES makes diabetes
have<00:01:33.390> a<00:01:33.420> much<00:01:33.810> more<00:01:34.170> challenging<00:01:34.530> time<00:01:35.070> to

00:01:35.090 --> 00:01:35.100 
have a much more challenging time to

00:01:35.100 --> 00:01:37.580 
have a much more challenging time to
control<00:01:35.610> their<00:01:35.820> blood<00:01:35.970> sugar<00:01:36.030> and<00:01:36.479> if<00:01:37.439> you're

00:01:37.580 --> 00:01:37.590 
control their blood sugar and if you're

00:01:37.590 --> 00:01:39.740 
control their blood sugar and if you're
a<00:01:37.680> diabetic<00:01:37.950> that's<00:01:38.520> a<00:01:38.790> risk<00:01:39.270> factor<00:01:39.479> for

00:01:39.740 --> 00:01:39.750 
a diabetic that's a risk factor for

00:01:39.750 --> 00:01:41.030 
a diabetic that's a risk factor for
periodontal<00:01:40.110> disease<00:01:40.500> and<00:01:40.680> periodontal

00:01:41.030 --> 00:01:41.040 
periodontal disease and periodontal

00:01:41.040 --> 00:01:43.850 
periodontal disease and periodontal
disease<00:01:41.250> gets<00:01:41.490> much<00:01:41.670> worse<00:01:41.909> so

00:01:43.850 --> 00:01:43.860 
disease gets much worse so

00:01:43.860 --> 00:01:45.290 
disease gets much worse so
what<00:01:43.950> comes<00:01:44.430> first<00:01:44.670> the<00:01:44.820> chicken<00:01:44.910> or<00:01:45.180> the<00:01:45.210> egg

00:01:45.290 --> 00:01:45.300 
what comes first the chicken or the egg

00:01:45.300 --> 00:01:46.760 
what comes first the chicken or the egg
so<00:01:45.540> to<00:01:45.600> speak<00:01:45.810> I<00:01:45.930> mean<00:01:45.960> does<00:01:46.200> having<00:01:46.440> gum

00:01:46.760 --> 00:01:46.770 
so to speak I mean does having gum

00:01:46.770 --> 00:01:48.050 
so to speak I mean does having gum
disease<00:01:47.100> mean<00:01:47.430> you're<00:01:47.580> more<00:01:47.730> likely<00:01:47.910> to

00:01:48.050 --> 00:01:48.060 
disease mean you're more likely to

00:01:48.060 --> 00:01:50.960 
disease mean you're more likely to
develop<00:01:48.930> diabetes<00:01:49.290> or<00:01:50.100> does<00:01:50.340> having<00:01:50.520> diabetes

00:01:50.960 --> 00:01:50.970 
develop diabetes or does having diabetes

00:01:50.970 --> 00:01:52.970 
develop diabetes or does having diabetes
mean<00:01:51.630> you're<00:01:51.780> more<00:01:51.870> likely<00:01:52.080> to<00:01:52.320> develop<00:01:52.470> gum

00:01:52.970 --> 00:01:52.980 
mean you're more likely to develop gum

00:01:52.980 --> 00:01:54.950 
mean you're more likely to develop gum
disease<00:01:53.280> or<00:01:53.520> is<00:01:53.700> that<00:01:53.880> not<00:01:54.060> the<00:01:54.090> relationship

00:01:54.950 --> 00:01:54.960 
disease or is that not the relationship

00:01:54.960 --> 00:01:58.640 
disease or is that not the relationship
well<00:01:55.290> they<00:01:55.890> are<00:01:56.070> related<00:01:56.720> but<00:01:57.720> diabetes<00:01:58.380> won't

00:01:58.640 --> 00:01:58.650 
well they are related but diabetes won't

00:01:58.650 --> 00:02:00.920 
well they are related but diabetes won't
cause<00:01:59.010> gum<00:01:59.370> disease<00:01:59.700> but<00:02:00.210> if<00:02:00.479> you're<00:02:00.900> a

00:02:00.920 --> 00:02:00.930 
cause gum disease but if you're a

00:02:00.930 --> 00:02:03.230 
cause gum disease but if you're a
diabetic<00:02:01.500> you<00:02:01.950> are<00:02:02.520> more<00:02:02.729> vulnerable<00:02:03.180> to

00:02:03.230 --> 00:02:03.240 
diabetic you are more vulnerable to

00:02:03.240 --> 00:02:05.030 
diabetic you are more vulnerable to
losing<00:02:03.660> bone<00:02:03.840> and<00:02:04.080> the<00:02:04.200> way<00:02:04.350> it<00:02:04.500> works<00:02:04.740> is

00:02:05.030 --> 00:02:05.040 
losing bone and the way it works is

00:02:05.040 --> 00:02:07.100 
losing bone and the way it works is
simply<00:02:05.760> is<00:02:05.940> if<00:02:06.330> you<00:02:06.450> don't<00:02:06.630> get<00:02:06.720> that<00:02:06.900> energy

00:02:07.100 --> 00:02:07.110 
simply is if you don't get that energy

00:02:07.110 --> 00:02:09.530 
simply is if you don't get that energy
from<00:02:07.530> the<00:02:07.650> blood<00:02:07.830> vessel<00:02:08.190> into<00:02:08.460> the<00:02:08.550> body<00:02:08.759> your

from the blood vessel into the body your

00:02:09.540 --> 00:02:10.940 
from the blood vessel into the body your

00:02:10.950 --> 00:02:13.490 
body's not functioning on all eight
cylinders<00:02:11.190> so<00:02:12.090> your<00:02:12.270> resistance<00:02:12.870> is<00:02:13.020> lower<00:02:13.230> so

00:02:13.490 --> 00:02:13.500 
cylinders so your resistance is lower so

00:02:13.500 --> 00:02:15.440 
cylinders so your resistance is lower so
if<00:02:13.830> you're<00:02:13.980> a<00:02:14.010> diabetic<00:02:14.280> with<00:02:14.790> uncontrolled

if you're a diabetic with uncontrolled
blood<00:02:15.660> sugar<00:02:16.110> you're<00:02:16.709> more<00:02:16.950> vulnerable<00:02:17.190> to

00:02:17.540 --> 00:02:17.550 
blood sugar you're more vulnerable to

00:02:17.550 --> 00:02:19.580

00:02:19.580 --> 00:02:19.590 
losing bone and your teeth much faster

00:02:19.590 --> 00:02:21.680 
losing bone and your teeth much faster
in<00:02:19.680> life<00:02:19.830> but<00:02:20.760> let's<00:02:21.060> say<00:02:21.209> you<00:02:21.300> don't<00:02:21.480> have

00:02:21.680 --> 00:02:21.690 
in life but let's say you don't have

00:02:21.690 --> 00:02:23.630 
in life but let's say you don't have
diabetes<00:02:21.870> and<00:02:22.260> you<00:02:22.530> develop<00:02:22.920> gum<00:02:23.130> disease<00:02:23.430> are

00:02:23.630 --> 00:02:23.640 
diabetes and you develop gum disease are

00:02:23.640 --> 00:02:25.400 
diabetes and you develop gum disease are
you<00:02:23.700> then<00:02:23.880> at<00:02:24.000> higher<00:02:24.209> risk<00:02:24.510> of<00:02:24.750> developing

00:02:25.400 --> 00:02:25.410 
you then at higher risk of developing

00:02:25.410 --> 00:02:26.720 
you then at higher risk of developing
diabetes<00:02:25.560> are<00:02:26.100> not<00:02:26.220> necessarily

00:02:26.720 --> 00:02:26.730 
diabetes are not necessarily

00:02:26.730 --> 00:02:28.970 
diabetes are not necessarily
unnecessarily<00:02:27.630> okay<00:02:27.959> that's<00:02:28.500> related

00:02:28.970 --> 00:02:28.980 
unnecessarily okay that's related

00:02:28.980 --> 00:02:31.520 
unnecessarily okay that's related
diabetes<00:02:29.550> is<00:02:29.670> related<00:02:30.150> to<00:02:30.330> your<00:02:30.600> inheritance

00:02:31.520 --> 00:02:31.530 
diabetes is related to your inheritance

00:02:31.530 --> 00:02:34.310 
diabetes is related to your inheritance
your<00:02:31.980> genetics<00:02:32.430> but<00:02:33.270> also<00:02:33.480> your<00:02:33.780> environment

00:02:34.310 --> 00:02:34.320 
your genetics but also your environment

00:02:34.320 --> 00:02:37.010 
your genetics but also your environment
for<00:02:34.709> example<00:02:35.190> if<00:02:35.430> you<00:02:35.910> think<00:02:36.150> of<00:02:36.300> the<00:02:36.450> body<00:02:36.690> is

00:02:37.010 --> 00:02:37.020 
for example if you think of the body is

00:02:37.020 --> 00:02:39.979 
for example if you think of the body is
a<00:02:37.190> 180<00:02:38.190> pound<00:02:38.340> person<00:02:39.000> produces<00:02:39.780> enough

00:02:39.979 --> 00:02:39.989 
a 180 pound person produces enough

00:02:39.989 --> 00:02:42.500 
a 180 pound person produces enough
insulin<00:02:40.380> for<00:02:40.530> 180<00:02:41.010> pounds<00:02:41.430> but<00:02:42.060> if<00:02:42.180> you<00:02:42.270> gain

00:02:42.500 --> 00:02:42.510 
insulin for 180 pounds but if you gain

00:02:42.510 --> 00:02:44.810 
insulin for 180 pounds but if you gain
too<00:02:42.750> much<00:02:42.780> weight<00:02:43.130> all<00:02:44.130> of<00:02:44.160> a<00:02:44.340> sudden<00:02:44.700> you

00:02:44.810 --> 00:02:44.820 
too much weight all of a sudden you

00:02:44.820 --> 00:02:46.729 
too much weight all of a sudden you
don't<00:02:45.360> have<00:02:45.570> more<00:02:45.810> insulin<00:02:46.230> being<00:02:46.410> produced

00:02:46.729 --> 00:02:46.739 
don't have more insulin being produced

00:02:46.739 --> 00:02:48.710 
don't have more insulin being produced
so<00:02:47.010> now<00:02:47.190> you're<00:02:47.489> deficient<00:02:48.090> in<00:02:48.180> your<00:02:48.330> insulin

00:02:48.710 --> 00:02:48.720 
so now you're deficient in your insulin

00:02:48.720 --> 00:02:50.870 
so now you're deficient in your insulin
that<00:02:48.840> your<00:02:48.989> body<00:02:49.230> needs<00:02:49.530> and<00:02:49.860> then<00:02:50.370> you<00:02:50.489> become

00:02:50.870 --> 00:02:50.880 
that your body needs and then you become

00:02:50.880 --> 00:02:52.820 
that your body needs and then you become
you<00:02:51.090> can<00:02:51.239> become<00:02:51.660> a<00:02:51.690> diabetic<00:02:52.049> just<00:02:52.560> because

00:02:52.820 --> 00:02:52.830 
you can become a diabetic just because

00:02:52.830 --> 00:02:54.860 
you can become a diabetic just because
of<00:02:53.010> gaining<00:02:53.610> too<00:02:53.730> much<00:02:53.760> weight<00:02:53.880> right

00:02:54.860 --> 00:02:54.870 
of gaining too much weight right

00:02:54.870 --> 00:02:56.840 
of gaining too much weight right
so<00:02:55.170> we<00:02:55.320> yeah<00:02:55.470> we<00:02:55.620> know<00:02:55.920> that<00:02:56.100> that<00:02:56.549> link

00:02:56.840 --> 00:02:56.850 
so we yeah we know that that link

00:02:56.850 --> 00:02:59.479 
so we yeah we know that that link
between<00:02:57.060> diabetes<00:02:57.480> and<00:02:57.840> obesity<00:02:58.470> this<00:02:59.280> is<00:02:59.430> the

00:02:59.479 --> 00:02:59.489 
between diabetes and obesity this is the

00:02:59.489 --> 00:03:00.650 
between diabetes and obesity this is the
first<00:02:59.700> time<00:02:59.820> we've<00:02:59.970> discussed<00:03:00.299> the<00:03:00.450> link

00:03:00.650 --> 00:03:00.660 
first time we've discussed the link

00:03:00.660 --> 00:03:02.720 
first time we've discussed the link
between<00:03:00.840> diabetes<00:03:01.380> and<00:03:01.709> gum<00:03:02.160> disease<00:03:02.310> and<00:03:02.670> you

00:03:02.720 --> 00:03:02.730 
between diabetes and gum disease and you

00:03:02.730 --> 00:03:04.580 
between diabetes and gum disease and you
say<00:03:02.940> that<00:03:03.299> one<00:03:03.510> of<00:03:03.600> the<00:03:03.690> key<00:03:03.840> factors<00:03:04.019> here<00:03:04.500> is

00:03:04.580 --> 00:03:04.590 
say that one of the key factors here is

00:03:04.590 --> 00:03:05.810 
say that one of the key factors here is
to<00:03:04.980> make<00:03:05.100> sure<00:03:05.130> that<00:03:05.400> the<00:03:05.489> lines<00:03:05.670> of

00:03:05.810 --> 00:03:05.820 
to make sure that the lines of

00:03:05.820 --> 00:03:07.910 
to make sure that the lines of
communication<00:03:05.880> between<00:03:06.600> your<00:03:07.320> dentist<00:03:07.799> and

communication between your dentist and
your<00:03:08.070> physician<00:03:08.400> remain<00:03:09.000> open<00:03:09.390> that's<00:03:10.080> very

00:03:10.580 --> 00:03:10.590 
your physician remain open that's very

00:03:10.590 --> 00:03:13.940 
your physician remain open that's very
very<00:03:10.920> true<00:03:11.220> if<00:03:11.760> your<00:03:12.350> physician<00:03:13.350> is<00:03:13.560> having<00:03:13.890> a

hard time controlling your blood sugar

00:03:15.570 --> 00:03:18.920 
hard time controlling your blood sugar
then<00:03:16.560> you<00:03:16.769> might<00:03:16.950> want<00:03:17.310> to<00:03:17.489> you<00:03:17.820> know<00:03:17.940> have<00:03:18.600> him

then you might want to you know have him

00:03:18.930 --> 00:03:20.840 
then you might want to you know have him
or<00:03:19.140> you<00:03:19.350> evaluate<00:03:20.040> whether<00:03:20.220> or<00:03:20.430> not<00:03:20.489> you<00:03:20.670> have

or you evaluate whether or not you have

00:03:20.850 --> 00:03:22.340 
or you evaluate whether or not you have
a<00:03:20.880> dental<00:03:21.239> problem<00:03:21.420> by<00:03:21.690> sending<00:03:22.019> you<00:03:22.080> to<00:03:22.230> the

a dental problem by sending you to the

00:03:22.350 --> 00:03:23.810 
a dental problem by sending you to the
dentist<00:03:22.500> and<00:03:22.860> make<00:03:23.100> sure<00:03:23.250> you<00:03:23.340> don't<00:03:23.489> have<00:03:23.610> gum

00:03:23.820 --> 00:03:26.150 
dentist and make sure you don't have gum
disease<00:03:23.850> because<00:03:24.780> if<00:03:24.930> you<00:03:25.110> there's<00:03:25.739> research

00:03:26.150 --> 00:03:26.160 
disease because if you there's research

00:03:26.160 --> 00:03:28.670 
disease because if you there's research
that<00:03:26.430> shows<00:03:26.700> that<00:03:26.730> if<00:03:27.269> you<00:03:27.299> have<00:03:27.510> per<00:03:28.049> dumb

disease and periodontal disease together

00:03:30.540 --> 00:03:33.110 
disease and periodontal disease together
it's<00:03:31.440> six<00:03:31.860> times<00:03:32.100> more<00:03:32.310> difficult<00:03:32.640> to<00:03:33.000> control

00:03:33.110 --> 00:03:33.120 
it's six times more difficult to control

00:03:33.120 --> 00:03:36.020 
it's six times more difficult to control
your<00:03:33.390> blood<00:03:33.630> sugar<00:03:34.100> so<00:03:35.100> obviously<00:03:35.519> if<00:03:35.700> you<00:03:35.850> do

00:03:36.020 --> 00:03:36.030

your blood sugar so obviously if you do
have<00:03:36.269> diabetes<00:03:36.690> you<00:03:37.230> should<00:03:37.440> also<00:03:37.920> share<00:03:38.220> this

00:03:38.360 --> 00:03:38.370
