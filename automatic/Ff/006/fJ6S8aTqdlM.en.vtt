 funny and funny moments of the world 

00:00:15.250 --> 00:00:17.370
 tanks 

00:00:18.700 --> 00:00:22.630
 we begin today with an incredibly brave and 

00:00:21.430 --> 00:00:25.330
 accurate shot 

00:00:22.630 --> 00:00:27.730
 games to Papazyan on black prince and battle 

00:00:25.330 --> 00:00:30.340
 coming to the end and hurrying over the kid 

00:00:27.730 --> 00:00:33.010
 some more damage and trying to pick up 

00:00:30.340 --> 00:00:35.470
 Statement last frag but that's bad luck to 

00:00:33.010 --> 00:00:38.350
 the trajectory of his projectile drew and 

00:00:35.470 --> 00:00:40.330
 su-122 with which he blocked 

00:00:38.350 --> 00:00:42.970
 opportunity to shoot in the mouth 

00:00:40.330 --> 00:00:44.590
 go around it will not work Fri-shka already 

00:00:42.970 --> 00:00:46.930
 prepared to finish off the enemy 

00:00:44.590 --> 00:00:49.330
 but our hero is not discouraged and clings to 

00:00:46.930 --> 00:00:50.680
 miserable chance and shoot under and 

00:00:49.330 --> 00:00:53.500
 drying code 

00:00:50.680 --> 00:00:55.840
 he manages to get between the bottom of the tank and 

00:00:53.500 --> 00:01:00.990
 land and at the same time destroy the last 

00:00:55.840 --> 00:01:00.990
 enemy amazing accuracy on the verge of foul 

00:01:08.110 --> 00:01:13.390
 in the second moment and the centurion groups 

00:01:10.750 --> 00:01:16.330
 what are y on the map the robin took 

00:01:13.390 --> 00:01:19.300
 traditional pt position on the alley and 

00:01:16.330 --> 00:01:22.000
 shoots at the enemy like the usual 

00:01:19.300 --> 00:01:24.760
 situation is nothing special stand yourself and 

00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:27.340
 shoot at the light of the light tank but here 

00:01:24.760 --> 00:01:30.100
 ill luck the firefly went to the center and not 

00:01:27.340 --> 00:01:32.620
 helps our hero means you need to somehow 

00:01:30.100 --> 00:01:35.140
 handle yourself and so how to drive yourself 

00:01:32.620 --> 00:01:36.790
 shine is not an option whale I decide 

00:01:35.140 --> 00:01:40.720
 shoot the blondie 

00:01:36.790 --> 00:01:43.900
 and the very first shot destroys isu-152 

00:01:40.720 --> 00:01:46.450
 not bad great shot but kentu i don't 

00:01:43.900 --> 00:01:48.850
 stops there and right there 

00:01:46.450 --> 00:01:49.720
 next shot destroys 

00:01:48.850 --> 00:01:52.479
 ferdinand 

00:01:49.720 --> 00:01:56.460
 but this is serious with such intuition 

00:01:52.479 --> 00:01:56.460
 can claim the sniper of the week 

00:02:03.740 --> 00:02:09.319
 and now a new overlord map on which 

00:02:07.430 --> 00:02:11.900
 Cheburek player 2005 

00:02:09.319 --> 00:02:14.090
 driving a second gameplay 

00:02:11.900 --> 00:02:16.700
 the enemy in the center and now remains 

00:02:14.090 --> 00:02:19.550
 last enemy t71 and cheburek 

00:02:16.700 --> 00:02:21.980
 rushes to destroy him true he 

00:02:19.550 --> 00:02:24.769
 a little higher firefly well when 

00:02:21.980 --> 00:02:27.470
 stopped chasing the frags here and 

00:02:24.769 --> 00:02:30.440
 our hero takes a leap of faith hope 

00:02:27.470 --> 00:02:31.540
 in flight destroy the enemy and it is him 

00:02:30.440 --> 00:02:35.950
 succeeds 

00:02:31.540 --> 00:02:35.950
 stunning beautiful kill in the fall 

00:02:54.470 --> 00:03:00.150
 4 moment French artillery batchat 

00:02:57.660 --> 00:03:02.490
 who controls the player does she lens he 

00:03:00.150 --> 00:03:04.890
 occupies the traditional art on the map 

00:03:02.490 --> 00:03:08.730
 live oks position after moving 

00:03:04.890 --> 00:03:11.040
 and targets fellow for the nation mx 1390 

00:03:08.730 --> 00:03:13.200
 which moves nonstop 

00:03:11.040 --> 00:03:15.300
 trying to highlight as much as possible 

00:03:13.200 --> 00:03:17.760
 opponents while trying 

00:03:15.300 --> 00:03:20.790
 gulf out of the light and he succeeds 

00:03:17.760 --> 00:03:23.970
 it doesn't really help him 

00:03:20.790 --> 00:03:26.250
 on the contrary it is strange but whether the analysis did not shoot 

00:03:23.970 --> 00:03:29.010
 in the enemy while he was visible though 

00:03:26.250 --> 00:03:31.530
 had the opportunity but shot as soon as 

00:03:29.010 --> 00:03:34.500
 he disappeared from the lit and even though 

00:03:31.530 --> 00:03:36.860
 that devyanostyak 2 movement batchat succeeds 

00:03:34.500 --> 00:03:40.739
 destroy it it's just the quintessence 

00:03:36.860 --> 00:03:43.470
 WBB sure if the batchat shot before 

00:03:40.739 --> 00:03:46.040
 when the firefly was visible he probably would 

00:03:43.470 --> 00:03:46.040
 missed 

00:03:54.770 --> 00:04:01.380
 Well, in the last moment for today 

00:03:57.420 --> 00:04:03.230
 player fluke d and american. t67 

00:04:01.380 --> 00:04:05.850
 which is known for its small 

00:04:03.230 --> 00:04:07.440
 ammunition rather ammunition can and 

00:04:05.850 --> 00:04:10.200
 normal but only here 

00:04:07.440 --> 00:04:13.050
 rate of fire is such that often up to 

00:04:10.200 --> 00:04:15.450
 the end of the battle shells does not remain here and 

00:04:13.050 --> 00:04:18.209
 this battle fluke shoots right and left 

00:04:15.450 --> 00:04:20.730
 and the second to drag the fight destroys one 

00:04:18.209 --> 00:04:24.000
 opponent after another takes sixth 

00:04:20.730 --> 00:04:26.340
 fragment but on the same as he t 6 7 

00:04:24.000 --> 00:04:29.130
 not enough shells in all compartments 

00:04:26.340 --> 00:04:31.470
 empty and our hero accepts the right 

00:04:29.130 --> 00:04:33.750
 the decision to take the enemy ram and 

00:04:31.470 --> 00:04:36.900
 he manages this seventh frag in his piggy bank 

00:04:33.750 --> 00:04:41.220
 but the opponents are still three hp almost 

00:04:36.900 --> 00:04:43.200
 it remains to the ally t67 you will get it 

00:04:41.220 --> 00:04:45.390
 victoriously guards the mouth on the alley 

00:04:43.200 --> 00:04:48.210
 Hope only for our American 

00:04:45.390 --> 00:04:51.000
 Fri-Shku is going to capture the base can be seen 

00:04:48.210 --> 00:04:53.100
 grill and our hero tends to him that 

00:04:51.000 --> 00:04:55.590
 misses and fluke tries it 

00:04:53.100 --> 00:04:58.620
 crush your 28 pc 

00:04:55.590 --> 00:05:00.900
 he blamed on 64 opponents is not wrong 

00:04:58.620 --> 00:05:01.560
 need to go somehow differently from the side 

00:05:00.900 --> 00:05:04.620
 behind 

00:05:01.560 --> 00:05:05.220
 1 x n 10 better gray trying 

00:05:04.620 --> 00:05:07.950
 to leave 

00:05:05.220 --> 00:05:10.890
 Conveniently substitutes karma 25 more hapka 

00:05:07.950 --> 00:05:12.930
 removed and some more enemy hordes 

00:05:10.890 --> 00:05:15.810
 gentlemanly watching the development 

00:05:12.930 --> 00:05:18.419
 events allowing in fair combat 

00:05:15.810 --> 00:05:20.550
 find out who is stronger seems the grill 

00:05:18.419 --> 00:05:22.919
 recharged and ready to finish it 

00:05:20.550 --> 00:05:26.520
 pushing but he lacks maneuverability 

00:05:22.919 --> 00:05:30.000
 a couple more jolts and the grill dies but 

00:05:26.520 --> 00:05:32.160
 our hero is only 11 x n fluke 

00:05:30.000 --> 00:05:34.680
 rushes to capture suddenly get lucky 

00:05:32.160 --> 00:05:35.790
 the invaders take but on the way meets 

00:05:34.680 --> 00:05:38.370
