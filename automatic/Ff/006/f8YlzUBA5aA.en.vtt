around<00:03:00.690> with<00:03:01.100> but<00:03:02.100> i<00:03:02.480> don't<00:03:03.480> take<00:03:03.720> time<00:03:03.930> to<00:03:04.050> do

00:03:04.160 --> 00:03:04.170 
around with but i don't take time to do

00:03:04.170 --> 00:03:07.040 
around with but i don't take time to do
that<00:03:04.320> right<00:03:04.650> now<00:03:04.910> so<00:03:05.910> the<00:03:06.240> easiest<00:03:06.390> way<00:03:06.750> to<00:03:06.810> do

00:03:07.040 --> 00:03:07.050 
that right now so the easiest way to do

00:03:07.050 --> 00:03:09.670 
that right now so the easiest way to do
that<00:03:07.080> to<00:03:07.670> circumvent<00:03:08.670> this<00:03:08.970> problem<00:03:09.030> is<00:03:09.630> to

00:03:09.670 --> 00:03:09.680 
that to circumvent this problem is to

00:03:09.680 --> 00:03:13.430 
that to circumvent this problem is to
simply<00:03:10.680> go<00:03:10.860> to<00:03:11.190> fire<00:03:11.580> box<00:03:12.020> okay<00:03:13.020> so<00:03:13.200> we're<00:03:13.410> on

00:03:13.430 --> 00:03:13.440 
simply go to fire box okay so we're on

00:03:13.440 --> 00:03:15.980 
simply go to fire box okay so we're on
firefox<00:03:14.130> so<00:03:14.640> if<00:03:14.760> we<00:03:14.850> go<00:03:15.000> into<00:03:15.120> file<00:03:15.420> manager

00:03:15.980 --> 00:03:15.990 
firefox so if we go into file manager

00:03:15.990 --> 00:03:21.110 
firefox so if we go into file manager
