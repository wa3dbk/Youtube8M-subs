00:00:16.400 --> 00:00:16.410 
think this is going to solve the issue

00:00:16.410 --> 00:00:26.839 
think this is going to solve the issue
but<00:00:17.100> it<00:00:17.190> can't<00:00:17.369> hurt<00:00:23.119> okay<00:00:24.119> much<00:00:24.330> cleaner<00:00:25.849> one

00:00:26.839 --> 00:00:26.849
