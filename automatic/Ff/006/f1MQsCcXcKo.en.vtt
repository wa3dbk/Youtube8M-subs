00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.890
 dear friend and after we are behind 

00:00:03.870 --> 00:00:14.370
 drilled a hole processed naphil 

00:00:07.890 --> 00:00:22.189
 stone or here's how I different nozzles 

00:00:14.370 --> 00:00:29.130
 so that it was easier for us to push through 

00:00:22.189 --> 00:00:32.360
 the very first one is this tee I take 

00:00:29.130 --> 00:00:36.290
 badge is my oil which i 

00:00:32.360 --> 00:00:36.290
 I use for chain lubrication 

00:00:37.820 --> 00:00:45.960
 electro drank well, that's what I sawed 

00:00:41.190 --> 00:00:47.239
 the firewood itself is oil after some 

00:00:45.960 --> 00:00:51.420
 time 

00:00:47.239 --> 00:00:53.640
 breaks down into harmless components then 

00:00:51.420 --> 00:01:01.859
 there is no engine oil 

00:00:53.640 --> 00:01:05.700
 and oil with specifically for electric saws for 

00:01:01.859 --> 00:01:08.890
 chain lubrication and so we are a little bit on 

00:01:05.700 --> 00:01:12.460
 sprinkled and then 

00:01:08.890 --> 00:01:15.310
 with such rotational movements we 

00:01:12.460 --> 00:01:19.119
 all this we drag it we will 

00:01:15.310 --> 00:01:22.950
 first means here in principle 

00:01:19.119 --> 00:01:26.770
 take this one off 

00:01:22.950 --> 00:01:29.979
 docking station but then wearing it 

00:01:26.770 --> 00:01:37.030
 it's easier for me like this 

00:01:29.979 --> 00:01:42.720
 we drag it all up to 

00:01:37.030 --> 00:01:47.320
 right place where we have 1 

00:01:42.720 --> 00:01:51.660
 stand well now we just outline and already 

00:01:47.320 --> 00:01:54.190
 in place we will tinker with us 

00:01:51.660 --> 00:01:57.160
 push back or vice versa 

00:01:54.190 --> 00:02:03.330
 move a little further and then 

00:01:57.160 --> 00:02:07.990
 this oil you take is just plain 

00:02:03.330 --> 00:02:14.620
 napkin and wipe that's all now 

00:02:07.990 --> 00:02:16.140
 I will put all these hiding places and then we 

00:02:14.620 --> 00:02:23.130
 you will insert 

00:02:16.140 --> 00:02:23.130
 here are these racks like this
