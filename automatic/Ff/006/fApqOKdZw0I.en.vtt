about shoes how to tell fakes and if you

00:02:02.399 --> 00:02:04.010 
about shoes how to tell fakes and if you

00:02:12.619 --> 00:02:12.629 
keep watching videos like that you'll be

00:02:12.629 --> 00:02:13.630

00:02:13.630 --> 00:02:13.640 
able to tell off

00:02:13.640 --> 00:02:17.260 
able to tell off
one<00:02:13.910> verse<00:02:14.210> real<00:02:15.170> one<00:02:15.440> and<00:02:16.220> a<00:02:16.340> heartbeat<00:02:16.790> for

00:02:17.260 --> 00:02:17.270 
one verse real one and a heartbeat for

00:02:17.270 --> 00:02:18.460 
one verse real one and a heartbeat for
example<00:02:17.540> like<00:02:17.630> with<00:02:17.720> Foamposites<00:02:18.350> the

00:02:18.460 --> 00:02:18.470 
example like with Foamposites the

00:02:18.470 --> 00:02:22.000 
example like with Foamposites the
easiest<00:02:18.980> just<00:02:19.160> because<00:02:19.520> of<00:02:20.410> the<00:02:21.410> backs<00:02:21.680> being

00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:22.010 
easiest just because of the backs being

00:02:22.010 --> 00:02:24.160 
easiest just because of the backs being
so<00:02:22.280> different<00:02:22.790> and<00:02:22.970> the<00:02:23.240> carbon<00:02:23.600> fiber<00:02:23.780> being

00:02:24.160 --> 00:02:24.170 
so different and the carbon fiber being

00:02:24.170 --> 00:02:27.130 
so different and the carbon fiber being
way<00:02:24.410> off<00:02:24.620> and<00:02:25.120> even<00:02:26.120> if<00:02:26.209> people<00:02:26.360> do<00:02:26.540> do<00:02:26.780> carbon

00:02:27.130 --> 00:02:27.140 
way off and even if people do do carbon

00:02:27.140 --> 00:02:29.320 
way off and even if people do do carbon
fiber<00:02:27.350> fixes<00:02:27.860> the<00:02:27.980> you<00:02:28.069> uh<00:02:28.100> you<00:02:28.940> could<00:02:29.120> tell

00:02:29.320 --> 00:02:29.330 
fiber fixes the you uh you could tell

00:02:29.330 --> 00:02:31.420 
fiber fixes the you uh you could tell
the<00:02:29.630> pattern<00:02:29.930> there's<00:02:30.140> not<00:02:30.260> the<00:02:30.410> same<00:02:30.620> but

00:02:31.420 --> 00:02:31.430 
the pattern there's not the same but

00:02:31.430 --> 00:02:33.460 
the pattern there's not the same but
yeah<00:02:32.240> so<00:02:32.450> basically<00:02:32.600> if<00:02:32.959> you<00:02:33.080> guys<00:02:33.200> want<00:02:33.440> to

yeah so basically if you guys want to

00:02:33.470 --> 00:02:35.949 
yeah so basically if you guys want to
get<00:02:33.590> you<00:02:33.800> for<00:02:34.250> cheap<00:02:34.700> just<00:02:35.090> go<00:02:35.240> on<00:02:35.360> ebay<00:02:35.690> you
