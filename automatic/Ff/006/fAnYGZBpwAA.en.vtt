 disturbing story of the great mystery 

00:00:24.640 --> 00:00:31.539
 of the former USSR at the beginning of 

00:00:27.460 --> 00:00:34.329
 February 1959 the weather was good in 

00:00:31.539 --> 00:00:37.530
 the area of ​​the urals a dozen

 years was preparing to make a 

00:00:43.210 --> 00:00:48.219
 expedition to the mountain range 

00:00:45.690 --> 00:00:50.229
 when they set off for the 

00:00:48.219 --> 00:00:53.409
 base of the hill or clumsy nobody presaged 

00:00:50.229 --> 00:00:55.809
 his fatal fate to reach the last 

00:00:53.409 --> 00:00:59.350
 place of provisioning a member 

00:00:55.809 --> 00:01:01.870
 of the sick txuri urdin team 

00:00:59.350 --> 00:01:04.239
 suddenly what forced him to 

00:01:01.870 --> 00:01:06.100
 stay there to recover before the 

00:01:04.239 --> 00:01:06.909
 inability to keep up with the pace of 

00:01:06.100 --> 00:01:09.999
 rest of the 

00:01:06.909 --> 00:01:12.579
 power students paradoxically 

00:01:09.999 --> 00:01:14.499
 those circumstances became 

00:01:12.579 --> 00:01:18.090
 for its protagonist in an event 

00:01:14.499 --> 00:01:22.600
 providential and at the same time in a 

00:01:18.090 --> 00:01:25.780
 discouraged nightmare yudin said goodbye 

00:01:22.600 --> 00:01:28.899
 of his nine companions would be the last 

00:01:25.780 --> 00:01:32.229
 time I would see them alive what they 

00:01:28.899 --> 00:01:35.590
 It happened from that time still 

00:01:32.229 --> 00:01:38.229
 being a complete mystery according to 

00:01:35.590 --> 00:01:40.929
 the basic safety rules when 

00:01:38.229 --> 00:01:43.750
 they will arrive in the area of ​​return visas 

00:01:40.929 --> 00:01:45.969
 of the mountain theater had to send a 

00:01:43.750 --> 00:01:48.700
 telegram to the Polytechnic Institute of 

00:01:45.969 --> 00:01:52.179
 the urals where they studied all the 

00:01:48.700 --> 00:01:54.640
 members of the group the young man calculated 

00:01:52.179 --> 00:01:59.020
 that would happen around the 12th of 

00:01:54.640 --> 00:02:01.149
 February but he warned that 

00:01:59.020 --> 00:02:04.209
 it could be delayed for a few days and the 

00:02:01.149 --> 00:02:06.039
 time was complicated for this reason 

00:02:04.209 --> 00:02:08.740
 nobody noticed his disappearance 

00:02:06.039 --> 00:02:11.260
 until after several weeks 

00:02:08.740 --> 00:02:13.570
 It was not until February 20 when the 

00:02:11.260 --> 00:02:16.000
 families of the hikers gave the 

00:02:13.570 --> 00:02:18.270
 voice of alarm in the absence of news 

00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:20.680
 of your loved ones 

00:02:18.270 --> 00:02:22.780
 then a team of 

00:02:20.680 --> 00:02:26.110
 rescue composed of members of the 

00:02:22.780 --> 00:02:29.350
 police and army and by a group of 

00:02:26.110 --> 00:02:32.380
 teachers and students of what today is the 

00:02:29.350 --> 00:02:35.370
 technical university of the ural after 

00:02:32.380 --> 00:02:38.800
 several days of searching on February 26 

00:02:35.370 --> 00:02:42.010
 they found the last camp that 

00:02:38.800 --> 00:02:45.040
 the students had established their 

00:02:42.010 --> 00:02:47.670
 state did not bode well 

00:02:45.040 --> 00:02:51.550
 student who found him mijail karabin 

00:02:47.670 --> 00:02:53.860
 he drew a chilling snapshot 

00:02:51.550 --> 00:02:56.140
 the stores were totally far away 

00:02:53.860 --> 00:02:59.100
 from inside partially covered 

00:02:56.140 --> 00:03:03.060
 for snow there was no one inside 

00:02:59.100 --> 00:03:06.700
 but strangely personal items 

00:03:03.060 --> 00:03:09.790
 and even the outerwear remained 

00:03:06.700 --> 00:03:13.060
 there when revealing the photos of the cameras 

00:03:09.790 --> 00:03:15.370
 that the young people had left behind as 

00:03:13.060 --> 00:03:17.620
 silent witnesses of what happened 

00:03:15.370 --> 00:03:19.959
 it was determined that the group had camped 

00:03:17.620 --> 00:03:22.810
 in that place on February 2 until 5 

00:03:19.959 --> 00:03:25.299
 in the afternoon the rescue team 

00:03:22.810 --> 00:03:27.250
 He also found a set of fingerprints 

00:03:25.299 --> 00:03:30.370
 in a straight line that started from the 

00:03:27.250 --> 00:03:32.590
 tents experts 

00:03:30.370 --> 00:03:35.170
 they said they belonged to a group of 

00:03:32.590 --> 00:03:37.150
 about eight or nine people what 

00:03:35.170 --> 00:03:40.690
 would show that all the students 

00:03:37.150 --> 00:03:43.540
 they climbed practically naked 

00:03:40.690 --> 00:03:46.840
 They wore socks and others a unique 

00:03:43.540 --> 00:03:50.410
 boot but some escaped with the feet 

00:03:46.840 --> 00:03:52.510
 barefoot the prints sank about 90 

00:03:50.410 --> 00:03:54.640
 centimeters in the snow and did not reveal 

00:03:52.510 --> 00:03:57.790
 signs of violence or the presence of 

00:03:54.640 --> 00:03:59.799
 someone outside the group were driving towards 

00:03:57.790 --> 00:04:02.440
 a small hill that led to a 

00:03:59.799 --> 00:04:07.000
 wooded mass nearby but after 500 

00:04:02.440 --> 00:04:08.769
 meters disappeared without a trace in 

00:04:07.000 --> 00:04:10.359
 the edge of the forest appeared the 

00:04:08.769 --> 00:04:12.840
 bodies without life of those of the 

00:04:10.359 --> 00:04:16.949
 Missing students 

00:04:12.840 --> 00:04:21.810
 georgi cream onishchenko of 24 years and 

00:04:16.949 --> 00:04:23.940
 yuri 25 of 21 their corpses rested 

00:04:21.810 --> 00:04:27.180
 under a big pine dresses only 

00:04:23.940 --> 00:04:30.870
 with underwear and without external signs 

00:04:27.180 --> 00:04:33.030
 of violence together they saw the 

00:04:30.870 --> 00:04:36.870
 remains of a bonfire and some branches 

00:04:33.030 --> 00:04:39.270
 Pine shattered a few meters 

00:04:36.870 --> 00:04:43.650
 a clearing of the trees lay 

00:04:39.270 --> 00:04:47.160
 bodies of the extensive booty of 22 years of 

00:04:43.650 --> 00:04:51.060

00:04:47.160 --> 00:04:51.930
 gordiant love of 23 for the position of 

00:04:51.060 --> 00:04:54.780
 the corpses 

00:04:51.930 --> 00:04:58.010
 it seemed that the young people had tried 

00:04:54.780 --> 00:05:00.169
 unsuccessfully to reach the camp 

00:04:58.010 --> 00:05:03.780
 establish the whereabouts of others 

00:05:00.169 --> 00:05:06.090
 hikers cost almost two months the 

00:05:03.780 --> 00:05:08.340
 four were buried under five 

00:05:06.090 --> 00:05:10.919
 meters of snow near a kind of 

00:05:08.340 --> 00:05:13.110
 small ravine next to the place where 

00:05:10.919 --> 00:05:14.860
 They had found the bodies of 

00:05:13.110 --> 00:05:18.550
 other victims 

00:05:14.860 --> 00:05:22.930
 they were nicolás tibias toasted and that of 24 

00:05:18.550 --> 00:05:26.770

00:05:31.000 --> 00:05:35.710
 practically destroyed inside and 

00:05:33.699 --> 00:05:39.699
 just such I live binina had several 

00:05:35.710 --> 00:05:43.389
 broken ribs plus the girl does not 

00:05:39.699 --> 00:05:46.080
 I had tongue despite it lesions 

00:05:43.389 --> 00:05:49.719
 external features that they presented were 

00:05:46.080 --> 00:05:51.729
 practically priceless years later 

00:05:49.719 --> 00:05:54.639
 some specialists in medicine 

00:05:51.729 --> 00:05:57.189
 forensic doctor like boris bags 

00:05:54.639 --> 00:06:00.370
 they have explained to me that it is impossible for a 

00:05:57.189 --> 00:06:02.560
 human being can cause wounds 

00:06:00.370 --> 00:06:05.560
 inmates who presented the last 

00:06:02.560 --> 00:06:08.409
 four corpses that are similar to the 

00:06:05.560 --> 00:06:09.880
 that occur in a vehicle at all 

00:06:08.409 --> 00:06:12.670
 speed 

00:06:09.880 --> 00:06:16.150
 externally they are not appreciated but the 

00:06:12.670 --> 00:06:17.980
 internal damages are fatal to discard 

00:06:16.150 --> 00:06:20.260
 human intervention 

00:06:17.980 --> 00:06:24.160
 researchers began to locate 

00:06:20.260 --> 00:06:26.020
 the witnesses of the time in 1990 the 

00:06:24.160 --> 00:06:27.850
 researcher and aviva did not get 

00:06:26.020 --> 00:06:30.460
 interview several military and 

00:06:27.850 --> 00:06:34.240
 meteorologist reported that between February 

00:06:30.460 --> 00:06:37.270
 and March 1959 had been spotted in the 

00:06:34.240 --> 00:06:39.220
 area some bright spheres for the 

00:06:37.270 --> 00:06:42.160
 ball those bright spheres were the 

00:06:39.220 --> 00:06:44.680
 key to the mystery among the few 

00:06:42.160 --> 00:06:46.660
 declassified documents on the case 

00:06:44.680 --> 00:06:48.730
 there is one that refers to 

00:06:46.660 --> 00:06:51.340
 hikers who camped about 

00:06:48.730 --> 00:06:54.760
 fifty kilometers away from the 

00:06:51.340 --> 00:06:57.670
 nine deceased the report reflects that 

00:06:54.760 --> 00:06:59.860
 on the night of February 2 saw 

00:06:57.670 --> 00:07:01.780
 strange colored light spheres 

00:06:59.860 --> 00:07:04.210
 orange that floated in the sky in 

00:07:01.780 --> 00:07:05.640
 address with the chair here on the 

00:07:04.210 --> 00:07:10.840
 mountains of another order 

00:07:05.640 --> 00:07:12.370
 for yu ting the only survivor is 

00:07:10.840 --> 00:07:15.160
 hypothesis is wrong 

00:07:12.370 --> 00:07:17.020
 more plausible since it explains the wounds 

00:07:15.160 --> 00:07:19.180
 and the strange tanned tone that 

00:07:17.020 --> 00:07:23.530
 they presented the corpses when they were 

00:07:19.180 --> 00:07:25.600
 found but certainly the proof that 

00:07:23.530 --> 00:07:29.520
 more the reinforce is the finding of high 

00:07:25.600 --> 00:07:29.520
 radiation levels in the bodies
