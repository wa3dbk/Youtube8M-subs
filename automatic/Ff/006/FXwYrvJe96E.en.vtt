00:00:14.870 --> 00:00:19.460
 I honestly believe that I had 12 3 

00:00:17.779 --> 00:00:20.990
 years I knew I was going to get to the first 

00:00:19.460 --> 00:00:22.430
 team when I spend with my father for the 

00:00:20.990 --> 00:00:24.490
 Spanish 

00:00:22.430 --> 00:00:26.680
 and the bernabÃ©u 

00:00:24.490 --> 00:00:28.510
 and I thought someday I'd say 

00:00:26.680 --> 00:00:30.070
 well I'll be playing there when I look 

00:00:28.510 --> 00:00:32.290
 with my father to always watch the matches 

00:00:30.070 --> 00:00:34.540
 Real Madrid and Real Madrid Bilbao 

00:00:32.290 --> 00:00:38.250
 society no 

00:00:34.540 --> 00:00:38.250
 I did not think I had it clear 

00:00:38.710 --> 00:00:43.760
 you are not 11 years old the typical letters that 

00:00:41.750 --> 00:00:45.469
 we send it between friends always the 

00:00:43.760 --> 00:00:47.960
 signature is the one that put the shape that I have 

00:00:45.469 --> 00:00:49.909
 today not for when some day it's worth 

00:00:47.960 --> 00:00:52.310
 millions the joke entity not me always 

00:00:49.909 --> 00:00:55.090
 I have very clear of small 

00:00:52.310 --> 00:01:00.000
 it's not easy is the real madrid is a club 

00:00:55.090 --> 00:01:03.710
 very big everything that surrounds madrid 

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:06.400
 It is also much bigger 

00:01:03.710 --> 00:01:06.400
 and it's not easy 

00:01:06.710 --> 00:01:11.659
 I may be lucky to be here 

00:01:09.049 --> 00:01:14.659
 in madrid to suck what is the real 

00:01:11.659 --> 00:01:18.100
 Madrid since childhood and that is why we are the 

00:01:14.659 --> 00:01:22.140
 easy place went wrong it came out better than 

00:01:18.100 --> 00:01:24.240
 may be another but effectively 

00:01:22.140 --> 00:01:26.520
 everything around them in Madrid there is 

00:01:24.240 --> 00:01:28.920
 to have the mind set to learn 

00:01:26.520 --> 00:01:31.470
 that you do not have to grow up because 

00:01:28.920 --> 00:01:33.920
 some have insisted on trying 

00:01:31.470 --> 00:01:36.080
 will clash christian ronaldo iker boxes 

00:01:33.920 --> 00:01:38.540
 not good, I think the real madrid 

00:01:36.080 --> 00:01:39.860
 sell a lot of christian be a player a 

00:01:38.540 --> 00:01:41.780
 person who sells you very much 

00:01:39.860 --> 00:01:45.170
 maybe the contribution that I have also in 

00:01:41.780 --> 00:01:46.610
 I also ramed but I do not really tell you 

00:01:45.170 --> 00:01:49.159
 you end up by the example right now 

00:01:46.610 --> 00:01:52.549
 with marcelo I do mallorca day 

00:01:49.159 --> 00:01:55.880
 there we had one or another nothing happens 

00:01:52.549 --> 00:01:57.740
 does not pass one day passes to another and illness 

00:01:55.880 --> 00:02:00.680
 or Christian himself will not show a day 

00:01:57.740 --> 00:02:04.540
 No, well, no, it's not something like 

00:02:00.680 --> 00:02:07.420
 that for him is black and for me the gray 

00:02:04.540 --> 00:02:09.940
 and point does not happen, nothing is not said 

00:02:07.420 --> 00:02:14.590
 and the time is already passing then another 

00:02:09.940 --> 00:02:16.630
 Once there is some connection on one side and 

00:02:14.590 --> 00:02:18.280
 another side or here is real today is little 

00:02:16.630 --> 00:02:20.650
 to stabilize that people the best 

00:02:18.280 --> 00:02:22.960
 see the good vibes and good atmosphere and the 

00:02:20.650 --> 00:02:25.900
 people well then want to try 

00:02:22.960 --> 00:02:29.760
 stabilize is not easy to have a 

00:02:25.900 --> 00:02:33.090
 template as young as this one very young 

00:02:29.760 --> 00:02:38.319
 in fact I am the second oldest in the 

00:02:33.090 --> 00:02:40.950
 29 years old team and be where we are 

00:02:38.319 --> 00:02:43.340
 the three live competitions 

00:02:40.950 --> 00:02:46.830
 with a very good group with a group 

00:02:43.340 --> 00:02:50.129
 strong and we are proving that a 

00:02:46.830 --> 00:02:51.269
 team for four or five more years very 

00:02:50.129 --> 00:02:52.500
 solid 

00:02:51.269 --> 00:02:55.040
 what is the biggest quarrel that they have thrown 

00:02:52.500 --> 00:02:55.040
 in a changing room 

00:02:55.220 --> 00:02:59.430
 to me 

00:02:57.630 --> 00:03:02.600
 remembered one of all the grandson that the 

00:02:59.430 --> 00:03:05.640
 national coach sub 15 to first 

00:03:02.600 --> 00:03:07.800
 party that says that the selection sub-15 

00:03:05.640 --> 00:03:10.740
 the international match and I remember 

00:03:07.800 --> 00:03:14.120
 one of fernando iron to me yes which of the 

00:03:10.740 --> 00:03:14.120
 wardrobe for a cover
