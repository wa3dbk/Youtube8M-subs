00:01:20.810 --> 00:01:20.820 
out of games if I died so that also took

00:01:20.820 --> 00:01:22.490 
out of games if I died so that also took
me<00:01:21.030> a<00:01:21.060> lot<00:01:21.240> longer<00:01:21.299> because<00:01:21.750> I<00:01:21.960> played<00:01:22.350> out

00:01:22.490 --> 00:01:22.500 
me a lot longer because I played out

00:01:22.500 --> 00:01:28.010 
me a lot longer because I played out
each<00:01:22.740> game<00:01:23.040> even<00:01:23.520> when<00:01:23.640> I<00:01:23.700> died<00:01:25.009> but<00:01:26.009> um<00:01:27.020> yeah

each game even when I died but um yeah

00:01:28.020 --> 00:01:29.420 
each game even when I died but um yeah
it<00:01:28.080> was<00:01:28.229> just<00:01:28.320> it's<00:01:28.590> just<00:01:28.650> a<00:01:28.829> rough<00:01:29.040> title

00:01:29.420 --> 00:01:29.430 
it was just it's just a rough title

00:01:29.430 --> 00:01:31.609 
it was just it's just a rough title
title<00:01:30.000> to<00:01:30.420> get<00:01:30.659> if<00:01:30.840> you're<00:01:30.990> going<00:01:31.200> to<00:01:31.320> rush

00:01:31.609 --> 00:01:31.619 
title to get if you're going to rush

00:01:31.619 --> 00:01:34.670 
title to get if you're going to rush
around<00:01:31.909> my<00:01:32.909> strategy<00:01:33.420> to<00:01:33.869> get<00:01:34.200> this<00:01:34.409> was

00:01:34.670 --> 00:01:34.680 
around my strategy to get this was

00:01:34.680 --> 00:01:36.950 
around my strategy to get this was
basically<00:01:34.890> to<00:01:35.310> get<00:01:35.460> your<00:01:35.579> first<00:01:35.820> V<00:01:36.030> set<00:01:36.299> which

00:01:36.950 --> 00:01:36.960 
basically to get your first V set which

00:01:36.960 --> 00:01:39.530 
basically to get your first V set which
is<00:01:37.170> 10<00:01:37.409> kills<00:01:37.710> with<00:01:37.950> hardline<00:01:38.340> and<00:01:38.549> once<00:01:39.450> you

00:01:39.530 --> 00:01:39.540 
is 10 kills with hardline and once you

00:01:39.540 --> 00:01:41.179 
is 10 kills with hardline and once you
get<00:01:39.689> your<00:01:39.750> first<00:01:39.930> V<00:01:40.170> set<00:01:40.409> hopefully<00:01:40.920> you<00:01:41.040> can

00:01:41.179 --> 00:01:41.189 
get your first V set hopefully you can

00:01:41.189 --> 00:01:43.639 
get your first V set hopefully you can
string<00:01:41.460> your<00:01:41.670> next<00:01:42.030> your<00:01:42.479> next<00:01:42.540> vsat<00:01:43.200> together

00:01:43.639 --> 00:01:43.649 
string your next your next vsat together

00:01:43.649 --> 00:01:47.060 
string your next your next vsat together
and<00:01:44.479> that<00:01:45.479> can<00:01:45.840> you<00:01:46.259> can<00:01:46.409> pretty<00:01:46.560> much<00:01:46.649> end<00:01:46.979> the

00:01:47.060 --> 00:01:47.070 
and that can you can pretty much end the

00:01:47.070 --> 00:01:48.980 
and that can you can pretty much end the
game<00:01:47.220> with<00:01:47.610> those<00:01:47.790> two<00:01:48.000> V<00:01:48.210> sets<00:01:48.479> so<00:01:48.689> that<00:01:48.840> was

00:01:48.980 --> 00:01:48.990 
game with those two V sets so that was

00:01:48.990 --> 00:01:51.109 
game with those two V sets so that was
my<00:01:49.020> strategy<00:01:49.409> so<00:01:49.979> here<00:01:50.159> I<00:01:50.189> get<00:01:50.399> my<00:01:50.490> first<00:01:50.670> vsat

00:01:51.109 --> 00:01:51.119 
my strategy so here I get my first vsat

00:01:51.119 --> 00:01:53.840 
my strategy so here I get my first vsat
and<00:01:51.360> I<00:01:52.350> just<00:01:52.829> waited<00:01:53.159> here<00:01:53.340> while<00:01:53.549> I<00:01:53.579> had<00:01:53.820> the

00:01:53.840 --> 00:01:53.850 
and I just waited here while I had the

00:01:53.850 --> 00:01:56.359 
and I just waited here while I had the
EMP<00:01:54.299> grenade<00:01:54.689> on<00:01:54.840> but<00:01:55.380> I'm<00:01:55.470> just<00:01:55.590> not<00:01:55.799> passive

00:01:56.359 --> 00:01:56.369 
EMP grenade on but I'm just not passive

00:01:56.369 --> 00:01:58.730 
EMP grenade on but I'm just not passive
player<00:01:56.579> like<00:01:56.820> this<00:01:57.210> that<00:01:57.750> that<00:01:58.259> for<00:01:58.500> me<00:01:58.590> like

player like this that that for me like

00:01:58.740 --> 00:02:00.830 
player like this that that for me like
if<00:01:58.860> I<00:01:58.979> wait<00:01:59.219> more<00:01:59.549> than<00:01:59.579> like<00:01:59.939> five<00:01:59.969> seconds<00:02:00.719> in

00:02:00.830 --> 00:02:00.840 
if I wait more than like five seconds in

00:02:00.840 --> 00:02:03.050 
if I wait more than like five seconds in
one<00:02:00.990> area<00:02:01.229> I<00:02:01.619> don't<00:02:02.490> know<00:02:02.579> I'm<00:02:02.670> just<00:02:02.820> too

00:02:03.050 --> 00:02:03.060 
one area I don't know I'm just too

00:02:03.060 --> 00:02:05.719 
one area I don't know I'm just too
impatient<00:02:03.270> and<00:02:03.960> I'm<00:02:04.680> always<00:02:04.950> the<00:02:05.280> aggressor<00:02:05.369> I

00:02:05.719 --> 00:02:05.729 
impatient and I'm always the aggressor I

00:02:05.729 --> 00:02:07.639 
impatient and I'm always the aggressor I
pretty<00:02:05.969> much<00:02:06.060> always<00:02:06.329> initiate<00:02:07.049> fights<00:02:07.320> which

00:02:07.639 --> 00:02:07.649 
pretty much always initiate fights which

00:02:07.649 --> 00:02:09.889 
pretty much always initiate fights which
is<00:02:07.799> which<00:02:08.520> is<00:02:08.670> not<00:02:08.819> it's<00:02:09.090> not<00:02:09.239> a<00:02:09.300> smart<00:02:09.690> way<00:02:09.869> of

00:02:09.889 --> 00:02:09.899 
is which is not it's not a smart way of

00:02:09.899 --> 00:02:12.380 
is which is not it's not a smart way of
playing<00:02:10.229> I<00:02:10.530> would<00:02:11.160> definitely<00:02:11.310> be<00:02:11.910> much

00:02:12.380 --> 00:02:12.390 
playing I would definitely be much

00:02:12.390 --> 00:02:13.550 
playing I would definitely be much
better<00:02:12.599> off<00:02:12.720> if

00:02:13.550 --> 00:02:13.560 
better off if

00:02:13.560 --> 00:02:15.620 
better off if
I<00:02:13.590> let<00:02:13.830> more<00:02:14.430> people<00:02:14.459> initiate<00:02:15.300> the<00:02:15.420> fights

00:02:15.620 --> 00:02:15.630 
I let more people initiate the fights

00:02:15.630 --> 00:02:17.150 
I let more people initiate the fights
and<00:02:15.870> I<00:02:15.930> kind<00:02:16.170> of<00:02:16.200> let<00:02:16.319> them<00:02:16.470> come<00:02:16.680> to<00:02:16.770> me<00:02:16.890> but

place and one of them happened to get me
and<00:03:58.620> I<00:03:58.680> knew<00:03:58.829> I<00:03:58.859> shouldn't<00:03:59.250> have<00:03:59.310> even<00:03:59.489> gone<00:03:59.730> up
