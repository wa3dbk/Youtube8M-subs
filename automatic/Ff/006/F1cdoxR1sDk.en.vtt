00:02:13.670 --> 00:02:13.680 
idea or anything like that and

00:02:13.680 --> 00:02:15.229 
idea or anything like that and
you're<00:02:13.950> doing<00:02:14.189> mythic<00:02:14.489> in<00:02:14.609> which<00:02:14.730> case<00:02:14.969> you

00:02:15.229 --> 00:02:15.239 
you're doing mythic in which case you

00:02:15.239 --> 00:02:16.819 
you're doing mythic in which case you
are<00:02:15.390> using<00:02:15.629> traditional<00:02:15.930> wrath<00:02:16.469> style

fixed-rate<00:02:17.459> ID<00:02:17.700> system<00:02:18.299> so<00:02:18.840> this<00:02:19.319> means<00:02:19.560> that

00:02:19.729 --> 00:02:19.739 
fixed-rate ID system so this means that

00:02:19.739 --> 00:02:22.130 
fixed-rate ID system so this means that
you<00:02:20.069> could<00:02:20.340> say<00:02:20.640> run<00:02:21.060> normal<00:02:21.599> loot<00:02:21.840> a<00:02:21.870> bunch<00:02:22.049> of

00:02:22.130 --> 00:02:22.140 
you could say run normal loot a bunch of

00:02:22.140 --> 00:02:23.780 
you could say run normal loot a bunch of
bosses<00:02:22.560> may<00:02:22.829> be<00:02:22.890> polluted<00:02:23.310> the<00:02:23.370> first<00:02:23.579> two

bosses may be polluted the first two

00:02:23.790 --> 00:02:26.119 
bosses may be polluted the first two
then<00:02:23.819> that's<00:02:24.390> fine<00:02:24.510> and<00:02:24.900> if<00:02:25.379> you<00:02:25.500> went<00:02:25.650> back<00:02:25.739> in

00:02:26.119 --> 00:02:26.129 
then that's fine and if you went back in

00:02:26.129 --> 00:02:27.679 
then that's fine and if you went back in
with<00:02:26.310> a<00:02:26.340> separate<00:02:26.760> group<00:02:26.909> then<00:02:27.329> you<00:02:27.540> could

00:02:27.679 --> 00:02:27.689 
with a separate group then you could

00:02:27.689 --> 00:02:29.059 
with a separate group then you could
still<00:02:27.870> do<00:02:28.049> those<00:02:28.200> two<00:02:28.409> bosses<00:02:28.620> you<00:02:28.859> just

still do those two bosses you just

00:02:29.069 --> 00:02:30.319

wouldn't be able to get loot from them
you<00:02:30.689> can<00:02:30.840> also<00:02:30.989> do<00:02:31.200> multiple<00:02:31.590> difficulty

00:02:32.059 --> 00:02:32.069 
you can also do multiple difficulty

00:02:32.069 --> 00:02:34.250 
you can also do multiple difficulty
levels<00:02:32.370> so<00:02:32.670> and<00:02:32.909> for<00:02:33.450> an<00:02:33.540> example<00:02:33.870> if<00:02:34.079> you're<00:02:34.230> a

00:02:34.250 --> 00:02:34.260

there and then your next line of the
week<00:02:45.299> you<00:02:45.420> could<00:02:45.540> go<00:02:45.689> back<00:02:45.900> up<00:02:46.139> to<00:02:46.290> rock<00:02:46.590> and

00:02:46.729 --> 00:02:46.739 
week you could go back up to rock and

00:02:46.739 --> 00:02:49.099 
week you could go back up to rock and
give<00:02:46.889> that<00:02:47.099> stuff<00:02:47.370> a<00:02:47.489> try<00:02:47.700> so<00:02:48.299> it's<00:02:48.659> a<00:02:48.900> lot<00:02:49.079> more

00:02:49.099 --> 00:02:49.109

00:02:51.800 --> 00:02:51.810 
flexible in that regard now also it's

00:02:51.810 --> 00:02:53.629 
flexible in that regard now also it's
worth<00:02:52.139> talking<00:02:52.409> about<00:02:52.560> character<00:02:53.159> stats<00:02:53.370> you

00:02:53.629 --> 00:02:53.639 
worth talking about character stats you

00:02:53.639 --> 00:02:55.520 
worth talking about character stats you
need<00:02:53.790> to<00:02:53.849> be<00:02:53.939> very<00:02:54.329> aware<00:02:54.659> of<00:02:54.900> these<00:02:55.260> and<00:02:55.470> this

need to be very aware of these and this
is<00:02:55.680> something<00:02:55.769> you<00:02:56.040> should<00:02:56.189> do<00:02:56.340> before<00:02:56.549> raids

00:02:57.349 --> 00:02:57.359

00:03:34.460 --> 00:03:34.470 
that stuff in this expansion so it's

00:03:34.470 --> 00:03:35.869 
that stuff in this expansion so it's
really<00:03:34.889> worth<00:03:35.040> knowing<00:03:35.400> about<00:03:35.489> that

00:03:35.869 --> 00:03:35.879 
really worth knowing about that

00:03:35.879 --> 00:03:37.879 
really worth knowing about that
generally<00:03:36.659> just<00:03:36.810> know<00:03:37.019> your<00:03:37.199> top<00:03:37.379> two<00:03:37.590> stats

00:03:37.879 --> 00:03:37.889 
generally just know your top two stats

00:03:37.889 --> 00:03:41.119 
generally just know your top two stats
and<00:03:38.629> then<00:03:39.629> you<00:03:40.109> know<00:03:40.229> take<00:03:40.470> the<00:03:40.590> bits<00:03:40.769> of<00:03:40.919> gear

00:03:41.119 --> 00:03:41.129 
and then you know take the bits of gear

00:03:41.129 --> 00:03:43.039 
and then you know take the bits of gear
from<00:03:41.280> the<00:03:41.430> Royal<00:03:41.609> dungeons<00:03:42.120> that<00:03:42.299> that

00:03:43.039 --> 00:03:43.049 
from the Royal dungeons that that

00:03:43.049 --> 00:03:44.719 
from the Royal dungeons that that
matched<00:03:43.259> them<00:03:43.590> and<00:03:43.889> then<00:03:43.979> just<00:03:44.189> prioritize

00:03:44.719 --> 00:03:44.729 
matched them and then just prioritize

00:03:44.729 --> 00:03:46.909 
matched them and then just prioritize
what<00:03:44.939> you<00:03:45.030> can<00:03:45.180> do<00:03:45.329> with<00:03:45.840> warforged<00:03:46.500> gear<00:03:46.769> and

00:03:46.909 --> 00:03:46.919 
what you can do with warforged gear and

00:03:46.919 --> 00:03:48.920 
what you can do with warforged gear and
then<00:03:47.489> of<00:03:47.639> course<00:03:47.669> sockets<00:03:48.239> sockets<00:03:48.810> are

00:03:48.920 --> 00:03:48.930 
then of course sockets sockets are

00:03:48.930 --> 00:03:50.899 
then of course sockets sockets are
extremely<00:03:49.500> powerful<00:03:49.650> by<00:03:50.040> the<00:03:50.099> way<00:03:50.280> oh<00:03:50.489> and

00:03:50.899 --> 00:03:50.909 
extremely powerful by the way oh and

00:03:50.909 --> 00:03:53.030 
extremely powerful by the way oh and

00:04:54.960 --> 00:04:57.230 
resources otherwise one-thousand-dollar
is<00:04:55.110> actually<00:04:55.530> super<00:04:55.770> easy<00:04:56.099> to<00:04:56.189> farm<00:04:56.490> up<00:04:56.699> so

00:04:57.230 --> 00:04:57.240 
is actually super easy to farm up so

00:04:57.240 --> 00:04:59.420 
is actually super easy to farm up so
that's<00:04:57.479> also<00:04:57.960> a<00:04:57.990> good<00:04:58.080> option<00:04:58.439> and<00:04:58.889> I<00:04:59.280> suppose

00:04:59.420 --> 00:04:59.430 
that's also a good option and I suppose

00:04:59.430 --> 00:05:01.309 
that's also a good option and I suppose
if<00:04:59.819> a<00:04:59.969> thousand<00:05:00.240> gold<00:05:00.389> is<00:05:00.569> nothing<00:05:00.900> to<00:05:01.050> you<00:05:01.169> and

00:05:01.309 --> 00:05:01.319 
if a thousand gold is nothing to you and

00:05:01.319 --> 00:05:02.749 
if a thousand gold is nothing to you and
I<00:05:01.349> know<00:05:01.409> many<00:05:01.620> people<00:05:02.009> are<00:05:02.280> in<00:05:02.520> that<00:05:02.639> situation

00:05:02.749 --> 00:05:02.759 
I know many people are in that situation

00:05:02.759 --> 00:05:04.939 
I know many people are in that situation
then<00:05:03.240> a<00:05:03.270> thousand<00:05:03.750> gold<00:05:03.870> makes<00:05:04.169> sense<00:05:04.500> of

00:05:04.939 --> 00:05:04.949 
then a thousand gold makes sense of

00:05:04.949 --> 00:05:06.110 
then a thousand gold makes sense of
course<00:05:05.190> just<00:05:05.460> like<00:05:05.639> in<00:05:05.819> mists<00:05:05.969> of<00:05:06.000> pandaria
