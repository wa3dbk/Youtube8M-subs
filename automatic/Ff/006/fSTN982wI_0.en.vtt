 A cow that can not sell with a car if it goes to the commuter 

00:01:01.550 --> 00:01:08.119
 There is a reason why you can't hit the mat with the car because it is at most a gold connection

00:01:35.690 --> 00:01:38.850
 It is another one from the point of view 

00:01:38.060 --> 00:01:41.939
 Well then 

00:01:38.850 --> 00:01:45.810
