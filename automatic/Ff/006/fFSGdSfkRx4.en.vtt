exercise what you can do is let those
shoes<00:03:19.959> dry<00:03:20.500> entirely<00:03:21.340> then<00:03:22.060> you're<00:03:22.269> going<00:03:22.360> to

00:03:22.410 --> 00:03:22.420 
shoes dry entirely then you're going to

00:03:22.420 --> 00:03:24.150 
shoes dry entirely then you're going to
get<00:03:22.600> yourself<00:03:22.720> a<00:03:23.170> cleaning<00:03:23.530> toothbrush<00:03:23.920> or

00:03:24.150 --> 00:03:24.160 
get yourself a cleaning toothbrush or

00:03:24.160 --> 00:03:25.500 
get yourself a cleaning toothbrush or
perhaps<00:03:24.519> a<00:03:24.730> brush<00:03:24.940> that's<00:03:25.120> a<00:03:25.239> little<00:03:25.390> bit

00:03:25.500 --> 00:03:25.510 
perhaps a brush that's a little bit

00:03:25.510 --> 00:03:27.000 
perhaps a brush that's a little bit
bigger<00:03:25.690> I<00:03:25.750> just<00:03:26.019> don't<00:03:26.170> have<00:03:26.320> one<00:03:26.470> handy<00:03:26.829> and

00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:27.010 
bigger I just don't have one handy and

00:03:27.010 --> 00:03:29.220 
bigger I just don't have one handy and
you're<00:03:27.459> literally<00:03:27.730> going<00:03:28.180> to<00:03:28.360> take<00:03:28.660> your<00:03:28.930> shoe

00:03:29.220 --> 00:03:29.230 
you're literally going to take your shoe

00:03:29.230 --> 00:03:31.500 
you're literally going to take your shoe
and<00:03:29.440> the<00:03:29.530> brush<00:03:29.739> and<00:03:29.980> start<00:03:30.549> dry<00:03:31.060> brushing

00:03:31.500 --> 00:03:31.510 
and the brush and start dry brushing

00:03:31.510 --> 00:03:33.420 
and the brush and start dry brushing
that<00:03:31.630> dirt<00:03:31.900> off<00:03:32.079> it's<00:03:32.320> a<00:03:32.410> lot<00:03:32.709> easier<00:03:32.950> to<00:03:33.220> deal

00:03:33.420 --> 00:03:33.430 
that dirt off it's a lot easier to deal

00:03:33.430 --> 00:03:35.670 
that dirt off it's a lot easier to deal
with<00:03:33.459> once<00:03:33.940> it's<00:03:34.150> actually<00:03:34.600> dry<00:03:34.840> so<00:03:35.350> let<00:03:35.530> that

00:03:35.670 --> 00:03:35.680 
with once it's actually dry so let that

00:03:35.680 --> 00:03:38.160 
with once it's actually dry so let that
all<00:03:35.799> fall<00:03:36.070> to<00:03:36.250> the<00:03:36.340> ground<00:03:36.370> once<00:03:37.299> that's<00:03:37.810> done

00:03:38.160 --> 00:03:38.170 
all fall to the ground once that's done

00:03:38.170 --> 00:03:39.720 
all fall to the ground once that's done
you'll<00:03:38.530> have<00:03:38.560> a<00:03:38.709> little<00:03:39.040> bit<00:03:39.130> of<00:03:39.160> dirt<00:03:39.459> left

00:03:39.720 --> 00:03:39.730 
you'll have a little bit of dirt left

00:03:39.730 --> 00:03:41.849 
you'll have a little bit of dirt left
and<00:03:40.030> you<00:03:40.180> can<00:03:40.359> make<00:03:40.510> a<00:03:40.540> solution<00:03:40.959> of<00:03:41.380> a

00:03:41.849 --> 00:03:41.859 
and you can make a solution of a

00:03:41.859 --> 00:03:43.949 
and you can make a solution of a
teaspoon<00:03:42.430> of<00:03:42.579> laundry<00:03:42.940> detergent<00:03:42.970> to<00:03:43.720> about<00:03:43.930> a

00:03:43.949 --> 00:03:43.959 
teaspoon of laundry detergent to about a

00:03:43.959 --> 00:03:45.810 
teaspoon of laundry detergent to about a
cup<00:03:44.200> of<00:03:44.320> water<00:03:44.380> dip<00:03:45.280> your<00:03:45.489> cleaning

00:03:45.810 --> 00:03:45.820 
cup of water dip your cleaning

00:03:45.820 --> 00:03:48.360 
cup of water dip your cleaning
toothbrush<00:03:46.239> or<00:03:46.540> a<00:03:46.600> cleaning<00:03:46.989> cloth<00:03:47.200> or<00:03:47.680> sponge

00:03:48.360 --> 00:03:48.370 
toothbrush or a cleaning cloth or sponge

00:03:48.370 --> 00:03:50.430 
toothbrush or a cleaning cloth or sponge
in<00:03:48.940> that<00:03:49.450> solution<00:03:49.840> and

00:03:50.430 --> 00:03:50.440 
in that solution and

00:03:50.440 --> 00:03:52.860 
in that solution and
just<00:03:50.590> lightly<00:03:51.100> start<00:03:51.760> to<00:03:51.940> clean<00:03:52.270> the<00:03:52.600> dirty

00:03:52.860 --> 00:03:52.870 
just lightly start to clean the dirty

00:03:52.870 --> 00:03:54.960 
just lightly start to clean the dirty
areas<00:03:53.320> the<00:03:53.800> idea<00:03:54.100> is<00:03:54.280> you<00:03:54.460> don't<00:03:54.490> want<00:03:54.790> to<00:03:54.850> get

00:03:54.960 --> 00:03:54.970 
areas the idea is you don't want to get

00:03:54.970 --> 00:03:57.300 
areas the idea is you don't want to get
the<00:03:55.090> shoe<00:03:55.300> too<00:03:55.600> too<00:03:55.810> wet<00:03:56.110> again<00:03:56.380> bum<00:03:57.040> shoes

00:03:57.300 --> 00:03:57.310 
the shoe too too wet again bum shoes

00:03:57.310 --> 00:03:59.910 
the shoe too too wet again bum shoes
really<00:03:57.610> can't<00:03:57.910> sustain<00:03:58.090> any<00:03:58.540> water<00:03:58.840> and<00:03:59.140> then

00:03:59.910 --> 00:03:59.920 
really can't sustain any water and then

00:03:59.920 --> 00:04:02.310 
really can't sustain any water and then
once<00:04:00.400> that's<00:04:00.760> done<00:04:01.000> you're<00:04:01.690> going<00:04:01.870> to<00:04:01.930> take<00:04:02.140> a

00:04:02.310 --> 00:04:02.320 
once that's done you're going to take a

00:04:02.320 --> 00:04:04.650 
once that's done you're going to take a
clean<00:04:02.740> sponge<00:04:03.340> either<00:04:03.760> and<00:04:04.000> take<00:04:04.120> some<00:04:04.330> clean

00:04:04.650 --> 00:04:04.660 
clean sponge either and take some clean

00:04:04.660 --> 00:04:06.390 
clean sponge either and take some clean
water<00:04:04.870> you're<00:04:05.440> going<00:04:05.530> to<00:04:05.620> rinse<00:04:05.860> off<00:04:06.100> any<00:04:06.310> of

00:04:06.390 --> 00:04:06.400 
water you're going to rinse off any of

00:04:06.400 --> 00:04:08.400 
water you're going to rinse off any of
those<00:04:06.550> extra<00:04:06.790> suds<00:04:07.390> and<00:04:07.720> then<00:04:08.140> you're<00:04:08.260> going

00:04:08.400 --> 00:04:08.410 
those extra suds and then you're going

00:04:08.410 --> 00:04:10.230 
those extra suds and then you're going
to<00:04:08.500> leave<00:04:08.710> your<00:04:08.890> shoe<00:04:09.160> to<00:04:09.370> dry<00:04:09.610> now<00:04:09.940> you're<00:04:10.090> not

putting it under artificial heat you're

00:04:12.220 --> 00:04:14.670 
putting it under artificial heat you're
literally<00:04:12.640> just<00:04:12.760> letting<00:04:13.660> it<00:04:13.780> air<00:04:13.930> dry<00:04:14.200> and<00:04:14.500> do
