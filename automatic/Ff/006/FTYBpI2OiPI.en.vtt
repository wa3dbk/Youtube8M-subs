00:01:13.640 --> 00:01:13.650 
Brazil so they wouldn't cost a huge

00:01:13.650 --> 00:01:15.499 
Brazil so they wouldn't cost a huge
amount<00:01:13.740> of<00:01:13.920> money<00:01:14.040> Microsoft<00:01:14.850> actually<00:01:15.119> set

00:01:17.120 --> 00:01:17.130 
up shop in Brazil so they can

00:01:17.130 --> 00:01:19.609 
up shop in Brazil so they can
manufacture<00:01:17.460> Xbox<00:01:18.270> ones<00:01:18.659> so<00:01:19.229> what<00:01:19.470> you're

00:01:19.609 --> 00:01:19.619 
manufacture Xbox ones so what you're

00:01:19.619 --> 00:01:23.240 
manufacture Xbox ones so what you're
looking<00:01:19.920> at<00:01:20.040> is<00:01:20.280> this<00:01:20.549> so<00:01:21.420> the<00:01:21.930> Wii<00:01:22.140> U<00:01:22.439> when<00:01:23.159> it

00:01:23.240 --> 00:01:23.250 
looking at is this so the Wii U when it

00:01:23.250 --> 00:01:25.340 
looking at is this so the Wii U when it
launched<00:01:23.610> in<00:01:23.729> Brazil<00:01:23.820> cost<00:01:24.750> eight<00:01:25.049> hundred

00:01:25.340 --> 00:01:25.350 
launched in Brazil cost eight hundred

00:01:25.350 --> 00:01:27.350 
launched in Brazil cost eight hundred
and<00:01:25.470> thirty<00:01:25.650> US<00:01:25.979> dollars<00:01:26.430> so<00:01:26.909> that's<00:01:27.119> more

00:01:27.350 --> 00:01:27.360 
and thirty US dollars so that's more

00:01:27.360 --> 00:01:28.850 
and thirty US dollars so that's more
than<00:01:27.540> double<00:01:27.900> what<00:01:27.930> it<00:01:28.200> cost<00:01:28.409> in<00:01:28.560> the<00:01:28.619> US

00:01:28.850 --> 00:01:28.860 
than double what it cost in the US

00:01:28.860 --> 00:01:31.310 
than double what it cost in the US
that's<00:01:29.159> due<00:01:29.430> to<00:01:29.549> tariffs<00:01:30.030> and<00:01:30.290> taxes<00:01:31.290> that

00:01:31.310 --> 00:01:31.320 
that's due to tariffs and taxes that

00:01:31.320 --> 00:01:32.899 
that's due to tariffs and taxes that
Nintendo<00:01:31.799> had<00:01:31.950> to<00:01:32.040> pay<00:01:32.220> and<00:01:32.460> there<00:01:32.549> to<00:01:32.640> make<00:01:32.790> up

right<00:02:27.300> well<00:02:27.780> I<00:02:27.810> would<00:02:28.140> day<00:02:28.349> that's<00:02:28.650> the<00:02:28.770> thing

00:02:28.910 --> 00:02:28.920 
right well I would day that's the thing

00:02:28.920 --> 00:02:30.650 
right well I would day that's the thing
though<00:02:29.040> Microsoft<00:02:29.340> did<00:02:29.819> and<00:02:30.030> now<00:02:30.420> Microsoft

00:02:30.650 --> 00:02:30.660 
though Microsoft did and now Microsoft

00:02:30.660 --> 00:02:33.979 
though Microsoft did and now Microsoft
has<00:02:31.110> a<00:02:31.140> stronghold<00:02:31.709> in<00:02:32.190> Brazil<00:02:32.610> I<00:02:32.880> mean<00:02:33.810> but

00:02:33.979 --> 00:02:33.989 
has a stronghold in Brazil I mean but

00:02:33.989 --> 00:02:35.180 
has a stronghold in Brazil I mean but
it's<00:02:34.110> whether<00:02:34.290> it's<00:02:34.349> a<00:02:34.590> huge<00:02:35.010> investment

00:02:35.180 --> 00:02:35.190 
it's whether it's a huge investment

00:02:35.190 --> 00:02:37.100 
it's whether it's a huge investment
though<00:02:35.730> but<00:02:35.940> it<00:02:36.060> is<00:02:36.390> I'm<00:02:36.569> not<00:02:36.690> saying<00:02:36.930> it's

00:02:37.100 --> 00:02:37.110 
though but it is I'm not saying it's

00:02:37.110 --> 00:02:39.350 
though but it is I'm not saying it's
small<00:02:37.430> and<00:02:38.430> I'm<00:02:38.550> not<00:02:38.700> saying<00:02:38.910> that<00:02:38.940> Microsoft

00:02:39.350 --> 00:02:39.360 
small and I'm not saying that Microsoft

00:02:39.360 --> 00:02:41.630 
small and I'm not saying that Microsoft
necessarily<00:02:39.840> smart<00:02:40.170> to<00:02:40.500> do<00:02:40.680> it<00:02:40.830> to<00:02:40.950> tackle<00:02:41.370> one

00:02:41.630 --> 00:02:41.640 
necessarily smart to do it to tackle one

00:02:41.640 --> 00:02:43.820 
necessarily smart to do it to tackle one
region<00:02:42.150> but<00:02:42.330> Microsoft<00:02:42.989> did<00:02:43.140> it<00:02:43.230> for<00:02:43.349> Xbox<00:02:43.709> one

00:02:43.820 --> 00:02:43.830 
region but Microsoft did it for Xbox one

00:02:43.830 --> 00:02:47.210 
region but Microsoft did it for Xbox one
and<00:02:44.220> Mike<00:02:44.910> and<00:02:45.390> the<00:02:45.450> Xbox<00:02:45.780> ones<00:02:46.049> are<00:02:46.410> like<00:02:46.860> 300

00:02:47.210 --> 00:02:47.220 
and Mike and the Xbox ones are like 300

00:02:47.220 --> 00:02:48.890 
and Mike and the Xbox ones are like 300
I<00:02:47.580> think<00:02:47.760> like<00:02:47.850> two<00:02:48.480> to<00:02:48.660> three<00:02:48.870> hundred

00:02:48.890 --> 00:02:48.900 
I think like two to three hundred

00:02:48.900 --> 00:02:51.650 
I think like two to three hundred
dollars<00:02:49.290> cheaper<00:02:49.350> than<00:02:49.730> an<00:02:50.730> imported<00:02:51.299> tariff

00:02:51.650 --> 00:02:51.660 
dollars cheaper than an imported tariff

00:02:51.660 --> 00:02:56.840 
dollars cheaper than an imported tariff
ps4<00:02:53.299> it<00:02:54.299> seems<00:02:54.660> to<00:02:54.840> be<00:02:54.930> a<00:02:54.959> problem<00:02:55.430> with<00:02:56.430> large

00:02:56.840 --> 00:02:56.850 
ps4 it seems to be a problem with large

00:02:56.850 --> 00:02:58.850 
ps4 it seems to be a problem with large
parts<00:02:57.330> of<00:02:57.420> Latin<00:02:57.750> America<00:02:58.170> with<00:02:58.290> games<00:02:58.560> so
