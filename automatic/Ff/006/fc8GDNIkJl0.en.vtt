00:00:12.770 --> 00:00:12.780 
before I end this review I basically

00:00:12.780 --> 00:00:16.249 
before I end this review I basically
just<00:00:13.080> want<00:00:13.320> to<00:00:13.440> give<00:00:13.860> a<00:00:14.129> comparison<00:00:15.020> with<00:00:16.020> the

00:00:16.249 --> 00:00:16.259 
just want to give a comparison with the

00:00:16.259 --> 00:00:20.749 
just want to give a comparison with the
wing<00:00:17.009> Gundam<00:00:17.490> and<00:00:17.720> the<00:00:18.720> wing<00:00:19.529> zero<00:00:19.950> now<00:00:20.520> as<00:00:20.640> you

00:00:20.749 --> 00:00:20.759 
wing Gundam and the wing zero now as you

00:00:20.759 --> 00:00:24.200 
wing Gundam and the wing zero now as you
can<00:00:20.849> see<00:00:21.090> that<00:00:21.390> the<00:00:21.950> the<00:00:22.950> body<00:00:23.189> is<00:00:23.550> pretty<00:00:24.029> much

00:00:24.200 --> 00:00:24.210 
can see that the the body is pretty much

00:00:24.210 --> 00:00:29.240 
can see that the the body is pretty much
the<00:00:24.419> same<00:00:24.630> basically<00:00:26.179> the<00:00:27.179> red<00:00:27.890> spike<00:00:28.890> here

00:00:29.240 --> 00:00:29.250 
the same basically the red spike here

00:00:29.250 --> 00:00:32.950 
the same basically the red spike here
our<00:00:29.550> claws<00:00:30.269> for<00:00:30.779> the<00:00:31.019> wing<00:00:31.230> Gundam<00:00:31.589> the

00:00:32.950 --> 00:00:32.960 
our claws for the wing Gundam the

00:00:32.960 --> 00:00:36.590 
our claws for the wing Gundam the
backpacks<00:00:34.010> no<00:00:35.010> wings<00:00:35.730> and<00:00:36.059> the<00:00:36.120> accessories

00:00:36.590 --> 00:00:36.600 
backpacks no wings and the accessories

00:00:36.600 --> 00:00:39.259 
backpacks no wings and the accessories
are<00:00:36.720> completely<00:00:37.140> this<00:00:37.290> different<00:00:38.010> but<00:00:38.280> as<00:00:39.030> far

00:00:39.259 --> 00:00:39.269 
are completely this different but as far

00:00:39.269 --> 00:00:41.600 
are completely this different but as far
as<00:00:39.300> the<00:00:39.809> main<00:00:39.960> body<00:00:40.230> goes<00:00:40.470> they<00:00:40.769> are<00:00:40.800> basically

00:00:41.600 --> 00:00:41.610 
as the main body goes they are basically

00:00:41.610 --> 00:00:47.000 
as the main body goes they are basically
the<00:00:41.820> same<00:00:42.799> wing<00:00:43.799> zero<00:00:44.100> being<00:00:44.489> the<00:00:46.010> grandfather

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:47.010 
the same wing zero being the grandfather

00:00:47.010 --> 00:00:51.380 
the same wing zero being the grandfather
of<00:00:47.190> all<00:00:47.640> the<00:00:47.790> five<00:00:47.970> kits<00:00:49.909> it's<00:00:50.909> only<00:00:51.119> natural

00:00:51.380 --> 00:00:51.390 
of all the five kits it's only natural

00:00:51.390 --> 00:00:56.079 
of all the five kits it's only natural
that<00:00:51.690> one<00:00:52.290> would<00:00:52.650> look<00:00:52.860> more<00:00:53.430> like<00:00:54.290> him<00:00:55.290> so

00:00:56.079 --> 00:00:56.089 
that one would look more like him so

00:00:56.089 --> 00:01:01.130 
that one would look more like him so
yeah<00:00:57.739> it's<00:00:58.739> amazing<00:00:59.070> to<00:00:59.489> me<00:00:59.610> how<00:00:59.640> far<00:01:00.510> a<00:01:00.780> color

00:01:01.130 --> 00:01:01.140 
yeah it's amazing to me how far a color

00:01:01.140 --> 00:01:04.929 
yeah it's amazing to me how far a color
swap<00:01:01.470> and<00:01:01.769> different<00:01:02.189> accessories<00:01:02.699> can<00:01:02.939> do<00:01:03.119> to

00:01:04.929 --> 00:01:04.939 
swap and different accessories can do to

00:01:04.939 --> 00:01:07.969 
swap and different accessories can do to
the<00:01:05.939> uniqueness<00:01:06.240> of<00:01:06.479> a<00:01:06.600> Gundam<00:01:06.960> I<00:01:07.229> mean<00:01:07.710> as<00:01:07.920> you

00:01:07.969 --> 00:01:07.979 
the uniqueness of a Gundam I mean as you

00:01:07.979 --> 00:01:09.620 
the uniqueness of a Gundam I mean as you
can<00:01:08.430> tell<00:01:08.610> these<00:01:08.790> are<00:01:08.970> basically<00:01:09.360> the<00:01:09.509> same

00:01:09.620 --> 00:01:09.630 
can tell these are basically the same

00:01:09.630 --> 00:01:13.850 
can tell these are basically the same
bill<00:01:10.080> this<00:01:11.040> one<00:01:11.250> came<00:01:11.759> out<00:01:11.880> after<00:01:12.650> this<00:01:13.650> one<00:01:13.830> I

00:01:13.850 --> 00:01:13.860 
bill this one came out after this one I

00:01:13.860 --> 00:01:16.370 
bill this one came out after this one I
believe<00:01:13.950> this<00:01:14.220> was<00:01:14.400> 2005<00:01:14.940> and<00:01:15.000> that<00:01:15.240> was<00:01:15.660> 2004

00:01:16.370 --> 00:01:16.380 
believe this was 2005 and that was 2004

00:01:16.380 --> 00:01:19.610 
believe this was 2005 and that was 2004
and<00:01:16.970> zero<00:01:17.970> actually<00:01:18.510> uses<00:01:18.930> the<00:01:19.020> same<00:01:19.260> mold

00:01:19.610 --> 00:01:19.620 
and zero actually uses the same mold

00:01:19.620 --> 00:01:24.260 
and zero actually uses the same mold
that<00:01:21.650> when<00:01:22.650> Gundam<00:01:23.010> has<00:01:23.160> except<00:01:23.820> for<00:01:23.970> like<00:01:24.150> I

00:01:24.260 --> 00:01:24.270 
that when Gundam has except for like I

00:01:24.270 --> 00:01:27.560 
that when Gundam has except for like I
said<00:01:24.330> different<00:01:24.780> accessories<00:01:25.260> but<00:01:25.590> they<00:01:26.570> they

00:01:27.560 --> 00:01:27.570 
said different accessories but they they

00:01:27.570 --> 00:01:30.110 
said different accessories but they they
look<00:01:27.810> completely<00:01:28.080> different<00:01:28.500> I<00:01:29.130> mean<00:01:29.400> that's

00:01:30.110 --> 00:01:30.120 
look completely different I mean that's

00:01:30.120 --> 00:01:35.270 
look completely different I mean that's
just<00:01:30.960> to<00:01:31.110> me<00:01:31.260> that's<00:01:31.710> pretty<00:01:32.010> amazing

00:01:35.270 --> 00:01:35.280 

00:01:35.280 --> 00:01:38.030 

one<00:01:35.700> thing<00:01:35.970> I<00:01:36.300> wanted<00:01:36.960> to<00:01:37.110> try<00:01:37.380> out<00:01:37.409> and<00:01:37.980> to

00:01:38.030 --> 00:01:38.040 
one thing I wanted to try out and to

00:01:38.040 --> 00:01:42.050 
one thing I wanted to try out and to
show<00:01:38.190> you<00:01:38.250> guys<00:01:38.460> is<00:01:38.820> that<00:01:38.850> uh<00:01:39.060> well<00:01:39.659> wing<00:01:40.820> 0<00:01:41.820> has

00:01:42.050 --> 00:01:42.060 
show you guys is that uh well wing 0 has

00:01:42.060 --> 00:01:43.670 
show you guys is that uh well wing 0 has
no<00:01:42.240> shield<00:01:42.540> because<00:01:42.900> it<00:01:43.020> doesn't<00:01:43.290> need<00:01:43.440> to

00:01:43.670 --> 00:01:43.680 
no shield because it doesn't need to

00:01:43.680 --> 00:01:46.070 
no shield because it doesn't need to
because<00:01:43.950> as<00:01:44.130> those<00:01:44.310> big<00:01:44.670> huge<00:01:45.150> wings<00:01:45.540> you<00:01:45.900> can

00:01:46.070 --> 00:01:46.080 
because as those big huge wings you can

00:01:46.080 --> 00:01:49.460 
because as those big huge wings you can
take<00:01:46.380> the<00:01:46.670> shield<00:01:47.670> from<00:01:47.820> wing<00:01:48.060> gundam<00:01:48.479> and<00:01:48.780> put

00:01:49.460 --> 00:01:49.470 
take the shield from wing gundam and put

00:01:49.470 --> 00:01:53.149 
take the shield from wing gundam and put
it<00:01:49.590> like<00:01:49.950> this<00:01:51.530> actually<00:01:52.530> looks<00:01:52.710> weird<00:01:53.010> with

00:01:53.149 --> 00:01:53.159 
it like this actually looks weird with

00:01:53.159 --> 00:01:56.660 
it like this actually looks weird with
the<00:01:53.250> shield<00:01:53.520> i<00:01:53.700> kind<00:01:53.940> of<00:01:55.280> kind<00:01:56.280> of<00:01:56.370> don't<00:01:56.549> like

00:01:56.660 --> 00:01:56.670 
the shield i kind of kind of don't like

00:01:56.670 --> 00:01:57.730 
the shield i kind of kind of don't like
that

00:01:57.730 --> 00:01:57.740 
that

00:01:57.740 --> 00:02:09.219 
that
um<00:02:00.729> yeah<00:02:01.990> also<00:02:07.209> the<00:02:08.209> white<00:02:08.450> I<00:02:08.720> forgot<00:02:09.140> to

00:02:09.219 --> 00:02:09.229 
um yeah also the white I forgot to

00:02:09.229 --> 00:02:12.339 
um yeah also the white I forgot to
mention<00:02:09.380> on<00:02:09.819> wing<00:02:10.819> Gundam<00:02:11.209> is<00:02:11.450> different<00:02:12.200> as

00:02:12.339 --> 00:02:12.349 
mention on wing Gundam is different as

00:02:12.349 --> 00:02:14.140 
mention on wing Gundam is different as
you<00:02:12.470> can<00:02:12.620> see<00:02:12.920> like<00:02:13.400> you<00:02:13.520> can<00:02:13.700> even<00:02:13.790> see<00:02:14.030> it<00:02:14.120> in

00:02:14.140 --> 00:02:14.150 
you can see like you can even see it in

00:02:14.150 --> 00:02:16.800 
you can see like you can even see it in
the<00:02:14.269> camera<00:02:14.420> hopefully<00:02:14.780> this<00:02:15.590> is<00:02:15.830> more<00:02:16.160> of<00:02:16.340> a

00:02:16.800 --> 00:02:16.810 
the camera hopefully this is more of a

00:02:16.810 --> 00:02:20.110 
the camera hopefully this is more of a
like<00:02:17.810> pure<00:02:18.260> white<00:02:18.650> and<00:02:19.340> this<00:02:19.459> is<00:02:19.519> more<00:02:19.910> of<00:02:20.030> a

00:02:20.110 --> 00:02:20.120 
like pure white and this is more of a

00:02:20.120 --> 00:02:25.809 
like pure white and this is more of a
cream<00:02:20.540> white<00:02:21.380> and<00:02:23.410> that's<00:02:24.410> about<00:02:24.590> it<00:02:24.739> for<00:02:25.040> the

00:02:25.809 --> 00:02:25.819 
cream white and that's about it for the

00:02:25.819 --> 00:02:30.430 
cream white and that's about it for the
comparison<00:02:26.450> really<00:02:27.280> um<00:02:28.280> I<00:02:28.930> guess<00:02:29.930> this<00:02:30.200> is<00:02:30.319> why

00:02:30.430 --> 00:02:30.440 
comparison really um I guess this is why

00:02:30.440 --> 00:02:36.370 
comparison really um I guess this is why
it's<00:02:30.680> so<00:02:30.799> easy<00:02:31.640> for<00:02:31.850> Bandai<00:02:32.420> to<00:02:32.920> create<00:02:35.380> or

00:02:36.370 --> 00:02:36.380 
it's so easy for Bandai to create or

00:02:36.380 --> 00:02:38.710 
it's so easy for Bandai to create or
wideband<00:02:36.769> I<00:02:36.950> chose<00:02:37.220> to<00:02:37.430> do<00:02:37.640> the<00:02:38.209> endless<00:02:38.510> waltz

00:02:38.710 --> 00:02:38.720 
wideband I chose to do the endless waltz

00:02:38.720 --> 00:02:41.140 
wideband I chose to do the endless waltz
in<00:02:38.930> line<00:02:39.049> first<00:02:39.410> because<00:02:39.830> not<00:02:40.100> only<00:02:40.130> is<00:02:40.549> the

00:02:41.140 --> 00:02:41.150 
in line first because not only is the

00:02:41.150 --> 00:02:46.380 
in line first because not only is the
manga<00:02:41.569> out<00:02:41.720> now<00:02:42.019> and<00:02:43.239> is<00:02:44.239> like<00:02:45.200> being

00:02:46.380 --> 00:02:46.390 
manga out now and is like being

00:02:52.479 --> 00:02:52.489 
something like that anyway even though

00:02:52.489 --> 00:02:55.479 
something like that anyway even though
the<00:02:52.880> manga<00:02:53.269> is<00:02:53.390> out<00:02:53.569> now<00:02:54.019> they're<00:02:54.890> kits<00:02:55.220> and

00:02:55.479 --> 00:02:55.489 
the manga is out now they're kits and

00:02:55.489 --> 00:02:57.460 
the manga is out now they're kits and
the<00:02:55.940> Gundams<00:02:56.299> are<00:02:56.540> essentially<00:02:57.110> the<00:02:57.290> same

00:02:57.460 --> 00:02:57.470 
the Gundams are essentially the same

00:02:57.470 --> 00:02:59.670 
the Gundams are essentially the same
body<00:02:57.709> with<00:02:58.190> different<00:02:58.700> accessories<00:02:58.970> and

00:02:59.670 --> 00:02:59.680 
body with different accessories and

00:02:59.680 --> 00:03:04.509 
body with different accessories and
colors<00:03:01.000> color<00:03:02.000> palettes<00:03:02.480> and<00:03:02.660> I<00:03:03.650> guess<00:03:04.280> that's

00:03:04.509 --> 00:03:04.519 
colors color palettes and I guess that's

00:03:04.519 --> 00:03:05.789 
colors color palettes and I guess that's
why<00:03:04.670> they<00:03:04.790> chose<00:03:04.850> to<00:03:05.060> do<00:03:05.329> this

00:03:05.789 --> 00:03:05.799 
why they chose to do this

00:03:05.799 --> 00:03:08.650 
why they chose to do this
the<00:03:06.799> endless<00:03:06.980> waltz<00:03:07.359> instead<00:03:08.359> of<00:03:08.510> the

00:03:08.650 --> 00:03:08.660 
the endless waltz instead of the

00:03:08.660 --> 00:03:11.770 
the endless waltz instead of the
original<00:03:09.109> anime<00:03:09.470> because<00:03:10.310> they<00:03:10.850> don't<00:03:11.480> differ

00:03:11.770 --> 00:03:11.780 
original anime because they don't differ

00:03:11.780 --> 00:03:15.539 
original anime because they don't differ
that<00:03:11.900> much<00:03:12.140> in<00:03:12.500> design<00:03:13.209> now<00:03:14.209> as<00:03:14.630> far<00:03:14.900> as<00:03:14.959> the

that much in design now as far as the

00:03:15.549 --> 00:03:22.259 
that much in design now as far as the
