00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.000
 and the team really made it great 

00:00:03.330 --> 00:00:09.630
 because they have not done any 

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:11.790
 more mistakes they really transmitted 

00:00:09.630 --> 00:00:13.710
 a great warmth a great one 

00:00:11.790 --> 00:00:16.859
 involvement not just because we are in 

00:00:13.710 --> 00:00:20.789
 italy but because it actually emanuela 

00:00:16.859 --> 00:00:23.140
 maccarani again did together with 

00:00:20.789 --> 00:00:25.180
 klarita kodra vale 

00:00:23.140 --> 00:00:28.539
 a rovetta and giulia galtarossa a 

00:00:25.180 --> 00:00:30.520
 exercise certainly that answers to 

00:00:28.539 --> 00:00:32.500
 new canons of 

00:00:30.520 --> 00:00:36.430
 of the code that we have inaugurated 

00:00:32.500 --> 00:00:37.960
 earlier this year but despite it 

00:00:36.430 --> 00:00:41.650
 changed the code changed 

00:00:37.960 --> 00:00:44.470
 gymnasts Italy still very convinced 

00:00:41.650 --> 00:00:45.340
 yesterday we are waiting with the second today 

00:00:44.470 --> 00:00:47.739
 height 

00:00:45.340 --> 00:00:50.460
 in the meantime that one is showing on the platform 

00:00:47.739 --> 00:00:55.800
 which we think will win 

00:00:50.460 --> 00:00:58.590
 work up of this this year and Russian 

00:00:55.800 --> 00:01:01.410
 as those who preceded it as a room 

00:00:58.590 --> 00:01:04.739
 kanaeva let's remember he won 

00:01:01.410 --> 00:01:09.060
 practically it is the own champion 

00:01:04.739 --> 00:01:12.330
 with the capital letter c and precisely svatos 

00:01:09.060 --> 00:01:13.649
 let's remember how he already has kayak and Russian 

00:01:12.330 --> 00:01:16.470
 said luigi that we are at the fourth 

00:01:13.649 --> 00:01:19.560
 rotation so we are at the end of 

00:01:16.470 --> 00:01:20.399
 them out so let's assume it's her 

00:01:19.560 --> 00:01:23.720
 less than 

00:01:20.399 --> 00:01:27.479
 here we do not say to me we say nothing 

00:01:23.720 --> 00:01:30.650
 in short, everything can always happen 

00:01:27.479 --> 00:01:33.290
 and then so much on the platform 

00:01:30.650 --> 00:01:35.570
 we see precisely the Russian pescaia 

00:01:33.290 --> 00:01:38.260
 we must say that we are on the side 

00:01:35.570 --> 00:01:41.770
 final of group b of the qualifications 

00:01:38.260 --> 00:01:43.750
 of individual competition 

00:01:41.770 --> 00:01:45.640
 definitely a competition he has 

00:01:43.750 --> 00:01:47.679
 also seen the Italian athletes 

00:01:45.640 --> 00:01:51.219
 really protagonists 

00:01:47.679 --> 00:01:54.149
 absolutely we have had various 

00:01:51.219 --> 00:01:57.789
 gymnasts who have both participated 

00:01:54.149 --> 00:02:01.179
 at the auction but the cars because yesterday 

00:01:57.789 --> 00:02:01.869
 morning this morning at the city of 

00:02:01.179 --> 00:02:05.319
 pesaro 

00:02:01.869 --> 00:02:06.530
 exactly julieta cantaluppi which is the 

00:02:05.319 --> 00:02:07.770
 our 

00:02:06.530 --> 00:02:10.769
 champion 

00:02:07.770 --> 00:02:16.080
 absolute and who also participated with 

00:02:10.769 --> 00:02:17.530
 excellent results in london and giulia pala 

00:02:16.080 --> 00:02:19.750
 which instead is one 

00:02:17.530 --> 00:02:22.209
 one of the many young people because I have to say 

00:02:19.750 --> 00:02:23.200
 that also on this occasion in Pesaro 

00:02:22.209 --> 00:02:25.620
 we have seen 

00:02:23.200 --> 00:02:25.620
 not at all 

00:02:26.310 --> 00:02:29.959
 I'm 

00:02:27.560 --> 00:02:32.630
 here is a word about Italians 

00:02:29.959 --> 00:02:36.310
 which now goes on stage and veronica 

00:02:32.630 --> 00:02:39.940
 bertolini will perform with the ribbon 

00:02:36.310 --> 00:02:39.940
