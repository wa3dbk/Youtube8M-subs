00:00:01.550 --> 00:00:04.799
 [Music] 

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:09.670
 last week it was atiba's turn 

00:00:08.170 --> 00:00:11.320
 hutchinson is their nine 

00:00:09.670 --> 00:00:12.219
 matches with to your four good too 

00:00:11.320 --> 00:00:13.599
 to predict 

00:00:12.219 --> 00:00:15.429
 this week it's man 's turn 

00:00:13.599 --> 00:00:17.320
 bakkal and he starts with FC Groningen 

00:00:15.429 --> 00:00:21.279
 against vitesse 

00:00:17.320 --> 00:00:23.050
 then I am going to be for Groningen I think 

00:00:21.279 --> 00:00:24.670
 well migrate to the season 

00:00:23.050 --> 00:00:27.039
 I would take that line through a certain home 

00:00:24.670 --> 00:00:30.119
 so you can in the euroborg 

00:00:27.039 --> 00:00:30.119
 second ajax nec 

00:00:30.310 --> 00:00:39.239
 second well i think one and one 

00:00:35.980 --> 00:00:41.800
 fill in although of course that too 

00:00:39.239 --> 00:00:44.649
 be able to pick up a new punch at campz 

00:00:41.800 --> 00:00:46.030
 but i think that rash 

00:00:44.649 --> 00:00:48.399
 then perhaps the surprise of it 

00:00:46.030 --> 00:00:51.280
 season excelsior against nac breda 

00:00:48.399 --> 00:00:52.899
 awkward opponent 

00:00:51.280 --> 00:00:57.059
 years of a bit hard to get into 

00:00:52.899 --> 00:00:57.059
 estimate mark from yes 

00:00:57.120 --> 00:01:04.739
 excel is his home heritage 

00:01:02.970 --> 00:01:06.900
 home team are doing well this week then 

00:01:04.739 --> 00:01:10.860
 the next psv heracles almelo 

00:01:06.900 --> 00:01:13.710
 yes clear 

00:01:10.860 --> 00:01:16.380
 we 're just going to win despite you 

00:01:13.710 --> 00:01:19.890
 are not there 

00:01:16.380 --> 00:01:22.290
 under which the words lead the leader 

00:01:19.890 --> 00:01:24.450
 FC Twente against the County 

00:01:22.290 --> 00:01:27.240
 twente the county who think so too 

00:01:24.450 --> 00:01:30.690
 the twente who is going to win 

00:01:27.240 --> 00:01:33.030
 it was the east of the country 

00:01:30.690 --> 00:01:33.990
 but I think that Twente is just corn 

00:01:33.030 --> 00:01:36.450
 own track 

00:01:33.990 --> 00:01:38.750
 psv it is not ending this competition 

00:01:36.450 --> 00:01:38.750
 round 

00:01:39.180 --> 00:01:43.830
 I hope so may now think for you 

00:01:41.820 --> 00:01:44.580
 will and two pass three points against 

00:01:43.830 --> 00:01:46.530
 feyenoord 

00:01:44.580 --> 00:01:48.740
 yes well i think we work there 

00:01:46.530 --> 00:01:50.850
 deliver 

00:01:48.740 --> 00:01:51.660
 [Music] 

00:01:50.850 --> 00:01:53.369
 the houses 

00:01:51.660 --> 00:01:55.710
 ado the hague also such a surprise this 

00:01:53.369 --> 00:01:57.390
 season against az that relationship time again 

00:01:55.710 --> 00:01:58.920
 do a lot better yes exactly and me 

00:01:57.390 --> 00:02:04.619
 both do a good job so then I go 

00:01:58.920 --> 00:02:05.069
 fc utrecht still plays against napel 

00:02:04.619 --> 00:02:07.289
 in 

00:02:05.069 --> 00:02:11.140
 yes I now pull the Heerenveen or it 

00:02:07.289 --> 00:02:13.060
 generally strong at home though 

00:02:11.140 --> 00:02:17.080
 then can have a fight in a villa 

00:02:13.060 --> 00:02:18.819
 are then problems legs he had 

00:02:17.080 --> 00:02:23.790
 comes from druten 

00:02:18.819 --> 00:02:23.790
 then the last vvv venlo against roda jc 

00:02:27.040 --> 00:02:31.740
 yes then i think that is also one 

00:02:29.170 --> 00:02:31.740
 draw 

00:02:32.020 --> 00:02:35.950
 no results for this competition round 

00:02:34.030 --> 00:02:38.590
 look again 

00:02:35.950 --> 00:02:39.850

00:02:38.590 --> 00:02:42.160
 mega group 

00:02:39.850 --> 00:02:45.070

00:02:42.160 --> 00:02:46.989

00:02:49.120 --> 00:02:53.170

00:02:51.670 --> 00:02:55.750

00:02:53.170 --> 00:02:57.970

00:02:57.970 --> 00:03:01.780
 what the midfielder had well above after 

00:03:00.730 --> 00:03:04.390
 we still see one 

00:03:01.780 --> 00:03:06.250
 erik pieters he knew seven games 

00:03:04.390 --> 00:03:07.239
 good to waste and it follows the 

00:03:06.250 --> 00:03:10.680
 ola toivones 

00:03:07.239 --> 00:03:17.139
