show you on YouTube how to cock a
crossbow<00:00:26.490> this<00:00:26.939> is<00:00:27.090> how<00:00:27.240> I<00:00:27.269> do<00:00:27.449> it<00:00:27.720> with<00:00:27.840> the

00:00:27.980 --> 00:00:27.990 
crossbow this is how I do it with the

00:00:27.990 --> 00:00:30.529 
crossbow this is how I do it with the
cable<00:00:28.320> system<00:00:28.740> it<00:00:29.640> may<00:00:29.820> not<00:00:29.970> be<00:00:30.150> the<00:00:30.359> perfect

00:00:30.529 --> 00:00:30.539 
cable system it may not be the perfect

00:00:30.539 --> 00:00:33.620 
cable system it may not be the perfect
way<00:00:30.840> this<00:00:31.470> is<00:00:31.590> works<00:00:31.769> for<00:00:32.009> me<00:00:32.270> like<00:00:33.270> I<00:00:33.390> said<00:00:33.600> I

00:00:33.620 --> 00:00:33.630 
way this is works for me like I said I

00:00:33.630 --> 00:00:35.479 
way this is works for me like I said I

fortunately I didn't have any video
footage<00:00:40.170> of<00:00:40.410> that<00:00:40.440> here<00:00:43.129> this<00:00:44.129> is<00:00:44.190> a<00:00:44.370> pulley

00:00:44.690 --> 00:00:44.700 
footage of that here this is a pulley

00:00:44.700 --> 00:00:47.720 
footage of that here this is a pulley
cable<00:00:45.329> system<00:00:45.780> you<00:00:46.020> got<00:00:46.170> two<00:00:46.350> hooks<00:00:46.620> what<00:00:47.610> the

00:00:47.720 --> 00:00:47.730 
cable system you got two hooks what the

00:00:47.730 --> 00:00:50.600 
cable system you got two hooks what the
pulleys<00:00:48.090> built-in<00:00:48.570> right<00:00:48.780> here<00:00:49.079> and<00:00:49.520> then<00:00:50.520> you

00:00:50.600 --> 00:00:50.610 
pulleys built-in right here and then you

00:00:50.610 --> 00:00:52.220 
pulleys built-in right here and then you
need<00:00:50.789> to<00:00:50.820> adjust<00:00:51.030> this<00:00:51.390> so<00:00:51.570> it's<00:00:51.719> comfortable

00:00:52.220 --> 00:00:52.230 
need to adjust this so it's comfortable

00:00:52.230 --> 00:00:52.880 
need to adjust this so it's comfortable
for<00:00:52.350> you

00:00:52.880 --> 00:00:52.890 
for you

for you
main<00:00:53.520> thing<00:00:54.140> during<00:00:55.140> cocking<00:00:55.649> this<00:00:55.829> is

00:00:55.939 --> 00:00:55.949 
main thing during cocking this is

00:00:55.949 --> 00:00:57.709 
main thing during cocking this is
keeping<00:00:56.309> these<00:00:56.430> into<00:00:56.969> the<00:00:57.059> inside<00:00:57.449> of<00:00:57.629> the

00:00:57.709 --> 00:00:57.719 
keeping these into the inside of the

00:00:57.719 --> 00:00:59.930 
keeping these into the inside of the
rail<00:00:57.899> here<00:00:58.289> that<00:00:58.920> way<00:00:59.070> it<00:00:59.190> cocks<00:00:59.460> nice<00:00:59.730> and

00:00:59.930 --> 00:00:59.940 
rail here that way it cocks nice and

00:00:59.940 --> 00:01:02.689 
rail here that way it cocks nice and

00:01:07.070 --> 00:01:07.080 
and like I said they do make a ratchet

00:01:07.080 --> 00:01:09.950 
and like I said they do make a ratchet
style<00:01:07.350> cocking<00:01:07.950> device<00:01:08.280> for<00:01:08.760> this<00:01:09.000> but<00:01:09.330> there

00:01:09.950 --> 00:01:09.960 
style cocking device for this but there

00:01:09.960 --> 00:01:11.330 
style cocking device for this but there
are<00:01:10.049> another<00:01:10.200> hundred<00:01:10.530> dollars<00:01:10.860> but<00:01:11.159> I'm

00:01:11.330 --> 00:01:11.340 
are another hundred dollars but I'm

00:01:11.340 --> 00:01:12.890 
are another hundred dollars but I'm
still<00:01:11.610> able<00:01:11.729> to<00:01:11.939> cock<00:01:12.210> this<00:01:12.390> with<00:01:12.630> just<00:01:12.780> a

00:01:12.890 --> 00:01:12.900 
still able to cock this with just a

00:01:12.900 --> 00:01:18.980 
still able to cock this with just a
cable<00:01:13.229> pulley<00:01:13.439> system<00:01:13.890> so<00:01:14.060> here<00:01:15.060> we<00:01:15.150> go<00:01:17.990> just

00:01:18.980 --> 00:01:18.990 
cable pulley system so here we go just

00:01:18.990 --> 00:01:21.989 
cable pulley system so here we go just
like<00:01:19.170> that

00:01:21.989 --> 00:01:21.999 

00:01:21.999 --> 00:01:25.770 

automatically<00:01:22.899> goes<00:01:23.109> on<00:01:23.350> safe<00:01:24.689> with<00:01:25.689> this

00:01:25.770 --> 00:01:25.780 
automatically goes on safe with this

00:01:25.780 --> 00:01:26.700 
automatically goes on safe with this
particular<00:01:26.229> motto

00:01:26.700 --> 00:01:26.710

once<00:01:26.950> it's<00:01:27.130> cock<00:01:27.450> so<00:01:28.450> no<00:01:28.659> further<00:01:28.929> ado<00:01:29.549> let's

00:01:30.539 --> 00:01:30.549 
once it's cock so no further ado let's

00:01:30.549 --> 00:01:32.580 
once it's cock so no further ado let's
move<00:01:30.909> the<00:01:31.090> camera<00:01:31.509> and<00:01:31.689> we'll<00:01:31.840> take<00:01:32.409> some

00:01:32.580 --> 00:01:32.590 
move the camera and we'll take some

00:01:32.590 --> 00:01:36.870 
move the camera and we'll take some
shots<00:01:32.770> downrange<00:01:33.450> let's<00:01:34.450> check<00:01:34.659> it<00:01:34.810> out<00:01:35.880> all

00:01:36.870 --> 00:01:36.880 
shots downrange let's check it out all

00:01:36.880 --> 00:01:38.309 
shots downrange let's check it out all
right<00:01:36.939> now<00:01:37.240> since<00:01:37.509> you<00:01:37.630> guys<00:01:37.749> seen<00:01:37.990> how<00:01:38.140> to<00:01:38.200> do

00:01:38.309 --> 00:01:38.319 
right now since you guys seen how to do

00:01:38.319 --> 00:01:40.260 
right now since you guys seen how to do
that<00:01:38.500> with<00:01:38.649> a<00:01:38.679> cable<00:01:38.890> system<00:01:39.159> we<00:01:39.909> got<00:01:40.090> some

00:01:40.260 --> 00:01:40.270 
that with a cable system we got some

00:01:40.270 --> 00:01:42.630 
that with a cable system we got some
field<00:01:40.509> tips<00:01:40.810> on<00:01:41.049> we've<00:01:41.950> got<00:01:42.099> a<00:01:42.130> target<00:01:42.549> down

00:01:42.630 --> 00:01:42.640 
field tips on we've got a target down

00:01:42.640 --> 00:01:45.690 
field tips on we've got a target down
there<00:01:42.849> about<00:01:43.030> 20<00:01:43.359> yards<00:01:43.509> away<00:01:43.780> and<00:01:44.700> we're

00:01:45.690 --> 00:01:45.700 
there about 20 yards away and we're

00:01:45.700 --> 00:01:46.919 
there about 20 yards away and we're
gonna<00:01:45.789> take<00:01:45.969> a<00:01:46.000> couple<00:01:46.119> shots<00:01:46.240> with<00:01:46.569> this<00:01:46.719> and

00:01:46.919 --> 00:01:46.929 
gonna take a couple shots with this and

00:01:46.929 --> 00:01:49.260 
gonna take a couple shots with this and
see<00:01:47.020> how<00:01:47.049> it<00:01:47.170> performs<00:01:47.729> this<00:01:48.729> is<00:01:48.880> just<00:01:49.030> to<00:01:49.119> give

00:01:49.260 --> 00:01:49.270 
see how it performs this is just to give

00:01:49.270 --> 00:01:51.330 
see how it performs this is just to give
you<00:01:49.359> a<00:01:49.390> general<00:01:49.810> idea<00:01:49.929> I<00:01:50.469> got<00:01:51.069> a<00:01:51.130> camera

00:01:51.330 --> 00:01:51.340 
you a general idea I got a camera

00:01:51.340 --> 00:01:55.859 
you a general idea I got a camera
downrange<00:01:52.000> on<00:01:52.299> the<00:01:52.590> actual<00:01:53.590> target<00:01:53.890> and<00:01:54.869> let's

00:01:55.859 --> 00:01:55.869 
downrange on the actual target and let's

00:01:55.869 --> 00:02:13.960 
downrange on the actual target and let's
see<00:01:56.020> how<00:01:56.110> it<00:01:56.259> does

00:02:13.960 --> 00:02:13.970 

00:02:13.970 --> 00:02:16.160 

it's<00:02:14.970> a<00:02:15.030> lot<00:02:15.180> up<00:02:15.270> another<00:02:15.510> one<00:02:15.750> and<00:02:15.900> check<00:02:16.050> it

00:02:16.160 --> 00:02:16.170 
it's a lot up another one and check it

00:02:16.170 --> 00:02:18.410 
it's a lot up another one and check it
out<00:02:16.320> we're<00:02:17.280> only<00:02:17.340> shooting<00:02:17.700> 20<00:02:18.000> yards<00:02:18.270> if<00:02:18.360> we

00:02:18.410 --> 00:02:18.420 
out we're only shooting 20 yards if we

like I said when this one cocks the
safety<00:02:41.560> goes<00:02:41.740> out<00:02:41.890> automatically<00:02:42.490> so<00:02:43.090> to

00:02:43.199 --> 00:02:43.209 
safety goes out automatically so to

00:02:43.209 --> 00:02:46.140 
safety goes out automatically so to
