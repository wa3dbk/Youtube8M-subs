1/2 inch drive but any 17 millimeter

00:02:20.940 --> 00:02:22.640 
1/2 inch drive but any 17 millimeter
will<00:02:21.120> do

00:02:22.640 --> 00:02:22.650 
will do

00:02:22.650 --> 00:02:26.450 
will do
so<00:02:23.650> I'm<00:02:23.740> going<00:02:23.860> to<00:02:23.890> go<00:02:24.010> ahead<00:02:24.100> and<00:02:24.340> loosen<00:02:24.520> this

00:02:26.450 --> 00:02:26.460 
so I'm going to go ahead and loosen this

00:02:26.460 --> 00:02:28.530 
so I'm going to go ahead and loosen this
next<00:02:27.460> you're<00:02:27.610> going<00:02:27.760> to<00:02:27.820> want<00:02:27.940> to<00:02:28.000> remove<00:02:28.270> the

fuel gauge sending unit and once it's

00:02:30.760 --> 00:02:32.610 
fuel gauge sending unit and once it's
loosened<00:02:30.970> it'll<00:02:31.330> lift<00:02:31.450> right<00:02:31.660> out<00:02:31.690> however<00:02:32.170> if

00:02:32.610 --> 00:02:32.620 
loosened it'll lift right out however if

00:02:32.620 --> 00:02:34.620 
loosened it'll lift right out however if
you<00:02:33.370> have<00:02:33.460> anything<00:02:33.730> in<00:02:33.820> your<00:02:33.880> fuel<00:02:34.120> tank<00:02:34.390> it

00:02:34.620 --> 00:02:34.630 
you have anything in your fuel tank it

00:02:34.630 --> 00:02:36.930 
you have anything in your fuel tank it
may<00:02:34.930> drip<00:02:35.290> all<00:02:35.500> over<00:02:35.530> the<00:02:35.920> back<00:02:36.310> shelf<00:02:36.640> here

00:02:36.930 --> 00:02:36.940 
may drip all over the back shelf here

00:02:36.940 --> 00:02:38.250 
may drip all over the back shelf here
and<00:02:37.090> over<00:02:37.240> the<00:02:37.330> seed<00:02:37.600> you<00:02:37.810> know<00:02:37.840> leaving<00:02:38.110> a

00:02:38.250 --> 00:02:38.260 
and over the seed you know leaving a

00:02:38.260 --> 00:02:40.320 
and over the seed you know leaving a
diesel<00:02:38.590> stink<00:02:38.860> in<00:02:38.950> the<00:02:39.040> car<00:02:39.220> so<00:02:39.550> what<00:02:40.210> I'm

00:02:40.320 --> 00:02:40.330 
diesel stink in the car so what I'm

00:02:40.330 --> 00:02:41.520 
diesel stink in the car so what I'm
actually<00:02:40.480> going<00:02:41.020> to<00:02:41.080> do<00:02:41.200> is<00:02:41.290> something<00:02:41.440> very

00:02:41.520 --> 00:02:41.530 
actually going to do is something very

00:02:41.530 --> 00:02:43.650 
actually going to do is something very
simpler<00:02:41.980> simple<00:02:42.970> I've<00:02:43.060> got<00:02:43.180> an<00:02:43.240> old<00:02:43.390> coffee

00:02:43.650 --> 00:02:43.660 
simpler simple I've got an old coffee

00:02:43.660 --> 00:02:45.600 
simpler simple I've got an old coffee
can<00:02:43.870> here<00:02:44.470> so<00:02:44.770> let's<00:02:44.920> lift<00:02:45.070> it<00:02:45.160> right<00:02:45.310> into<00:02:45.460> the

00:02:45.600 --> 00:02:45.610 
can here so let's lift it right into the

00:02:45.610 --> 00:02:48.840 
can here so let's lift it right into the
coffee<00:02:45.790> can<00:02:46.120> and<00:02:47.100> therefore<00:02:48.100> eliminate<00:02:48.730> the

00:02:48.840 --> 00:02:48.850 
coffee can and therefore eliminate the

00:02:48.850 --> 00:02:51.990 
coffee can and therefore eliminate the
possibility<00:02:49.480> of<00:02:50.430> anything<00:02:51.430> dripping<00:02:51.820> in<00:02:51.910> the

00:02:51.990 --> 00:02:52.000 
possibility of anything dripping in the

00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:55.320 
possibility of anything dripping in the
car<00:02:52.210> and<00:02:53.460> looks<00:02:54.460> like<00:02:54.580> the<00:02:54.700> tank<00:02:54.910> was<00:02:55.090> pretty

00:02:55.320 --> 00:02:55.330 
car and looks like the tank was pretty

00:02:55.330 --> 00:02:58.890 
car and looks like the tank was pretty
much<00:02:55.450> dry<00:02:55.780> anyway<00:02:57.180> see<00:02:58.180> that<00:02:58.330> shiny<00:02:58.570> stuff

00:02:58.890 --> 00:02:58.900 
much dry anyway see that shiny stuff

00:02:58.900 --> 00:03:00.630 
much dry anyway see that shiny stuff
that<00:02:59.080> that<00:02:59.620> is<00:02:59.740> the<00:02:59.860> fuel<00:03:00.070> so<00:03:00.280> I'm<00:03:00.430> going<00:03:00.580> to

00:03:00.630 --> 00:03:00.640 
that that is the fuel so I'm going to

00:03:00.640 --> 00:03:04.710 
that that is the fuel so I'm going to
get<00:03:00.790> my<00:03:02.070> I'm<00:03:03.070> going<00:03:03.310> to<00:03:03.370> get<00:03:03.520> my<00:03:03.670> hand<00:03:04.150> pump<00:03:04.510> and

00:03:04.710 --> 00:03:04.720 
get my I'm going to get my hand pump and

00:03:04.720 --> 00:03:07.860 
get my I'm going to get my hand pump and
pump<00:03:05.080> this<00:03:05.230> out<00:03:05.410> and<00:03:05.760> this<00:03:06.760> here<00:03:07.090> is<00:03:07.240> my<00:03:07.480> fluid

00:03:07.860 --> 00:03:07.870 
pump this out and this here is my fluid

00:03:07.870 --> 00:03:09.630 
pump this out and this here is my fluid
pump<00:03:08.080> if<00:03:08.560> you<00:03:08.770> don't<00:03:08.890> have<00:03:09.040> one<00:03:09.220> of<00:03:09.250> these<00:03:09.430> like

00:03:09.630 --> 00:03:09.640 
pump if you don't have one of these like

00:03:09.640 --> 00:03:12.750 
pump if you don't have one of these like
I<00:03:09.760> said<00:03:10.260> you<00:03:11.260> can<00:03:11.440> pull<00:03:12.040> the<00:03:12.130> hose<00:03:12.220> is<00:03:12.430> often

00:03:12.750 --> 00:03:12.760 
I said you can pull the hose is often

I said you can pull the hose is often
drain<00:03:12.910> the<00:03:13.030> fuel<00:03:13.180> out<00:03:13.360> the<00:03:13.540> bottom<00:03:13.840> I<00:03:14.020> just

00:03:14.280 --> 00:03:14.290 
drain the fuel out the bottom I just

00:03:14.290 --> 00:03:17.700 
drain the fuel out the bottom I just
find<00:03:14.440> this<00:03:14.560> a<00:03:14.620> little<00:03:14.980> easier<00:03:15.280> for<00:03:15.490> me<00:03:15.670> so<00:03:16.710> it's

00:03:17.700 --> 00:03:17.710 
find this a little easier for me so it's

00:03:17.710 --> 00:03:19.410 
find this a little easier for me so it's
gonna<00:03:17.860> be<00:03:17.980> a<00:03:18.010> little<00:03:18.190> difficult<00:03:18.310> to<00:03:18.550> show<00:03:18.760> this

side these are 13 millimeter
incidentally<00:04:03.040> the<00:04:04.230> the<00:04:05.230> divider<00:04:05.739> panel<00:04:06.100> which

00:04:06.180 --> 00:04:06.190 
incidentally the the divider panel which

00:04:06.190 --> 00:04:08.040 
incidentally the the divider panel which
I<00:04:06.250> just<00:04:06.430> took<00:04:06.519> out<00:04:06.730> those<00:04:07.120> were<00:04:07.390> 8<00:04:07.600> millimeter

00:04:08.040 --> 00:04:08.050 
I just took out those were 8 millimeter

00:04:08.050 --> 00:04:11.550 
I just took out those were 8 millimeter
nuts<00:04:08.260> so<00:04:08.769> I'm<00:04:09.100> going<00:04:09.400> to<00:04:09.840> take<00:04:10.840> these<00:04:11.080> four<00:04:11.140> out

00:04:11.550 --> 00:04:11.560 
nuts so I'm going to take these four out

00:04:11.560 --> 00:04:15.000 
nuts so I'm going to take these four out
now<00:04:11.769> and<00:04:12.780> once<00:04:13.780> those<00:04:14.019> four<00:04:14.350> nuts<00:04:14.680> are<00:04:14.860> out

00:04:15.000 --> 00:04:15.010 
now and once those four nuts are out

00:04:15.010 --> 00:04:19.349 
now and once those four nuts are out
you're<00:04:15.790> going<00:04:15.940> to<00:04:16.000> need<00:04:16.150> to<00:04:18.180> you're<00:04:19.180> going<00:04:19.299> to

00:04:19.349 --> 00:04:19.359 
you're going to need to you're going to

00:04:19.359 --> 00:04:21.599 
you're going to need to you're going to
need<00:04:19.480> to<00:04:19.600> release<00:04:19.930> the<00:04:20.140> vacuum<00:04:20.320> tank<00:04:20.830> which<00:04:21.370> is

00:04:21.599 --> 00:04:21.609 
need to release the vacuum tank which is

00:04:21.609 --> 00:04:24.810 
need to release the vacuum tank which is
this<00:04:22.000> a<00:04:22.710> great<00:04:23.710> looking<00:04:24.010> thing<00:04:24.250> right<00:04:24.460> here

00:04:24.810 --> 00:04:24.820 
this a great looking thing right here

00:04:24.820 --> 00:04:28.680 
this a great looking thing right here
and<00:04:26.220> then<00:04:27.220> once<00:04:27.460> everything<00:04:27.970> up<00:04:28.150> top<00:04:28.450> is

00:04:28.680 --> 00:04:28.690 
and then once everything up top is

00:04:28.690 --> 00:04:30.210 
and then once everything up top is
released<00:04:29.050> you're<00:04:29.560> going<00:04:29.680> to<00:04:29.770> want<00:04:29.890> to<00:04:29.950> release

00:04:30.210 --> 00:04:30.220 
released you're going to want to release

00:04:30.220 --> 00:04:32.219 
released you're going to want to release
the<00:04:30.460> hoses<00:04:31.090> from<00:04:31.240> the<00:04:31.360> fuel<00:04:31.660> tank<00:04:31.960> on<00:04:32.110> the

00:04:32.219 --> 00:04:32.229 
the hoses from the fuel tank on the

00:04:32.229 --> 00:04:35.250 
the hoses from the fuel tank on the
bottom<00:04:32.590> now<00:04:33.580> I<00:04:33.610> already<00:04:34.479> have<00:04:34.600> the

00:04:35.250 --> 00:04:35.260 
bottom now I already have the

00:04:35.260 --> 00:04:37.260 
bottom now I already have the
differential<00:04:36.070> out<00:04:36.220> of<00:04:36.310> the<00:04:36.370> way<00:04:36.490> here<00:04:36.730> exam<00:04:37.000> I

00:04:37.260 --> 00:04:37.270 
differential out of the way here exam I

00:04:37.270 --> 00:04:41.400 
differential out of the way here exam I
uninstalled<00:04:38.140> it<00:04:38.880> last<00:04:39.880> weekend<00:04:40.450> but<00:04:40.780> you

00:04:41.400 --> 00:04:41.410 
uninstalled it last weekend but you

00:04:41.410 --> 00:04:42.630 
uninstalled it last weekend but you
should<00:04:41.650> be<00:04:41.800> able<00:04:41.920> to<00:04:42.070> get<00:04:42.280> to<00:04:42.400> all<00:04:42.490> these

00:04:42.630 --> 00:04:42.640 
should be able to get to all these

00:04:42.640 --> 00:04:44.640 
should be able to get to all these
connections<00:04:43.240> even<00:04:43.750> with<00:04:44.050> the<00:04:44.140> differential

00:04:44.640 --> 00:04:44.650 
connections even with the differential

00:04:44.650 --> 00:04:48.600 
connections even with the differential
in<00:04:44.800> place<00:04:45.040> so<00:04:46.020> basically<00:04:47.020> we're<00:04:47.260> just<00:04:47.290> one<00:04:48.010> two

00:04:48.600 --> 00:04:48.610 
in place so basically we're just one two

00:04:48.610 --> 00:04:52.350 
in place so basically we're just one two
and<00:04:49.030> a<00:04:49.840> third<00:04:50.740> ho<00:04:50.980> hos<00:04:51.490> connection<00:04:51.940> right<00:04:52.090> here

00:04:52.350 --> 00:04:52.360 
and a third ho hos connection right here

00:04:52.360 --> 00:04:54.840 
and a third ho hos connection right here
so<00:04:52.600> I'm<00:04:52.750> going<00:04:52.870> to<00:04:53.310> disconnect<00:04:54.310> these<00:04:54.520> and<00:04:54.790> I

00:04:54.840 --> 00:04:54.850 
so I'm going to disconnect these and I

00:04:54.850 --> 00:04:57.660 
so I'm going to disconnect these and I
actually<00:04:54.970> have<00:04:55.540> a<00:04:55.570> drain<00:04:55.900> pan<00:04:56.170> with<00:04:56.470> me<00:04:56.670> just

00:04:57.660 --> 00:04:57.670 
actually have a drain pan with me just

00:04:57.670 --> 00:04:59.070 
actually have a drain pan with me just
in<00:04:57.790> case<00:04:57.970> anything<00:04:58.270> still<00:04:58.630> comes<00:04:58.810> out<00:04:58.900> of<00:04:59.020> the

00:04:59.070 --> 00:04:59.080 
in case anything still comes out of the

00:04:59.080 --> 00:05:01.890 
in case anything still comes out of the
fuel<00:04:59.260> tank<00:04:59.530> and<00:05:00.150> then<00:05:01.150> once<00:05:01.450> everything<00:05:01.870> is

00:05:01.890 --> 00:05:01.900 
fuel tank and then once everything is

00:05:01.900 --> 00:05:03.600 
fuel tank and then once everything is
disconnected<00:05:02.530> on<00:05:02.620> the<00:05:02.710> bottom<00:05:03.040> you<00:05:03.280> can<00:05:03.430> pull

00:05:03.600 --> 00:05:03.610 
disconnected on the bottom you can pull

00:05:03.610 --> 00:05:06.450 
disconnected on the bottom you can pull
the<00:05:03.730> fuel<00:05:03.940> tank<00:05:04.210> out<00:05:04.450> I<00:05:04.750> actually<00:05:05.680> had<00:05:06.160> to

00:05:06.450 --> 00:05:06.460 
the fuel tank out I actually had to

00:05:06.460 --> 00:05:08.550 
the fuel tank out I actually had to
slice<00:05:07.450> the<00:05:07.660> hoses<00:05:07.990> on<00:05:08.110> the<00:05:08.200> bottom<00:05:08.470> because

00:05:08.550 --> 00:05:08.560 
slice the hoses on the bottom because

00:05:08.560 --> 00:05:11.370 
slice the hoses on the bottom because
the<00:05:08.800> hose<00:05:08.920> clamps<00:05:09.600> weren't<00:05:10.600> in<00:05:10.720> great<00:05:10.930> shape<00:05:11.140> I

00:05:11.370 --> 00:05:11.380 
the hose clamps weren't in great shape I

00:05:11.380 --> 00:05:12.870 
the hose clamps weren't in great shape I
can<00:05:11.530> deal<00:05:11.710> with<00:05:11.770> those<00:05:12.040> once<00:05:12.310> the<00:05:12.460> tank<00:05:12.640> is<00:05:12.730> out

00:05:12.870 --> 00:05:12.880 
can deal with those once the tank is out

00:05:12.880 --> 00:05:15.600 
can deal with those once the tank is out
of<00:05:12.910> the<00:05:13.030> car<00:05:13.210> so<00:05:14.280> just<00:05:15.280> want<00:05:15.430> to<00:05:15.490> make<00:05:15.580> sure

00:05:15.600 --> 00:05:15.610 
of the car so just want to make sure

00:05:15.610 --> 00:05:18.180 
of the car so just want to make sure
that<00:05:16.000> the<00:05:16.450> filler<00:05:16.960> mech<00:05:17.230> clears<00:05:17.800> on<00:05:17.980> the<00:05:18.070> way

00:05:18.180 --> 00:05:18.190 
that the filler mech clears on the way

00:05:18.190 --> 00:05:22.290 
that the filler mech clears on the way
out<00:05:18.340> and<00:05:18.610> that<00:05:19.390> should<00:05:19.630> be<00:05:19.750> pretty<00:05:19.930> much<00:05:20.020> it
