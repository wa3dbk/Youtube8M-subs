00:00:20.490 --> 00:00:25.930
 but before many many many 

00:00:24.460 --> 00:00:28.570
 thanks to all those people who saw the 

00:00:25.930 --> 00:00:30.579
 previous video of how to be in the 

00:00:28.570 --> 00:00:33.130
 expansion many many thanks 

00:00:30.579 --> 00:00:35.620
 I was so surprised to see his reproductions 

00:00:33.130 --> 00:00:37.300
 because it was something that I did not expect true 

00:00:35.620 --> 00:00:40.060
 almost three thousand reproductions up 

00:00:37.300 --> 00:00:42.220
 right now this video is really something 

00:00:40.060 --> 00:00:44.260
 very very very enthusiastic for what is going 

00:00:42.220 --> 00:00:45.790
 starting and to make it his third video 

00:00:44.260 --> 00:00:48.640
 have three thousand reproductions seriously 

00:00:45.790 --> 00:00:49.780
 which is great but for all 

00:00:48.640 --> 00:00:53.050
 those people who commented on 

00:00:49.780 --> 00:00:54.850
 video of what worked for them that worked 

00:00:53.050 --> 00:00:59.710
 with some problem thank you very much 

00:00:54.850 --> 00:01:01.030
 thanks for that all of you and that's why 

00:00:59.710 --> 00:01:02.890
 same this video is to try 

00:01:01.030 --> 00:01:06.159
 help you about the problem 

00:01:02.890 --> 00:01:09.369
 that the 104 stopped working 

00:01:06.159 --> 00:01:12.620
 this is due to two things that are 

00:01:09.369 --> 00:01:16.520
 running a launcher that is not 

00:01:12.620 --> 00:01:19.310
 and here I need the breaks and be wrong 

00:01:16.520 --> 00:01:21.740
 put the cracks ok I'm going to spend 

00:01:19.310 --> 00:01:24.800
 directors to assemble what we touch 

00:01:21.740 --> 00:01:26.690
 brotherhoods need to have mounted the 

00:01:24.800 --> 00:01:28.710
 files the room units of the two 

00:01:26.690 --> 00:01:30.390
 things 

00:01:28.710 --> 00:01:32.070
 if you have expansion for that of the 

00:01:30.390 --> 00:01:35.760
 song also if you have the one of 

00:01:32.070 --> 00:01:37.290
 the 104 of the 54 there already depends on that 

00:01:35.760 --> 00:01:38.909
 have you if you have no song are going to 

00:01:37.290 --> 00:01:40.530
 be the same steps but with nothing more 

00:01:38.909 --> 00:01:42.360
 with the sims this in the expansion 

00:01:40.530 --> 00:01:46.549
 they will do the same with the song that 

00:01:42.360 --> 00:01:46.549
 I bought with expansion expansion 

00:01:49.729 --> 00:01:54.750
 although here 

00:01:52.050 --> 00:01:57.899
 these three files of my copy and 

00:01:54.750 --> 00:02:03.690
 immediately take care of local disk archives of the 

00:01:57.899 --> 00:02:06.509
 program for 86 I'll go to 64 I'll 

00:02:03.690 --> 00:02:09.170
 go install after I do not believe that 

00:02:06.509 --> 00:02:13.980
 tell us is pc 

00:02:09.170 --> 00:02:17.280
 13 of 2013 upside down and we will run 

00:02:13.980 --> 00:02:20.700
 the needy this is the excel point of 

00:02:17.280 --> 00:02:22.319
 its operating system 64 of 86 86 is what 

00:02:20.700 --> 00:02:25.470
 same as 32 bands so it is that not 

00:02:22.319 --> 00:02:28.349
 know how they can see I have installed 

00:02:25.470 --> 00:02:31.190
 is 86 since there are times when 

00:02:28.349 --> 00:02:34.580
 they work do not work 

00:02:31.190 --> 00:02:39.290
 the kids of the 64 best, most profitable 

00:02:34.580 --> 00:02:43.610
 integral of 86 and you have a 9 84 64 what 

00:02:39.290 --> 00:02:46.280
 what we are going to do is enjoy it 

00:02:43.610 --> 00:02:49.490
 but I already have it by part mind 

00:02:46.280 --> 00:02:51.830
 mentioned in those who will not seem 

00:02:49.490 --> 00:02:55.540
 that prompted the lion art administered 

00:02:51.830 --> 00:02:58.790
 and good is to remove bandita that 

00:02:55.540 --> 00:03:02.080
 we hope it's not the three minutes two 

00:02:58.790 --> 00:03:02.080
 minutes in which it is installed 

00:03:02.810 --> 00:03:05.440
 but we wait 

00:03:05.740 --> 00:03:09.170
 trying I'm recording dark 

00:03:07.670 --> 00:03:11.630
 sobretasa to see the light in my house and 

00:03:09.170 --> 00:03:16.570
 it started to rain but with hail 

00:03:11.630 --> 00:03:20.390
 bad wrong but the thickness of the rain 

00:03:16.570 --> 00:03:23.060
 knights of hail and white sergio the 

00:03:20.390 --> 00:03:25.070
 patio as I have a little piece of garden 

00:03:23.060 --> 00:03:26.150
 also in the target the army but 

00:03:25.070 --> 00:03:27.819
 synchronization is moving 

00:03:26.150 --> 00:03:32.620
 slowly 

00:03:27.819 --> 00:03:35.170
 you have to advance the close let's go another 

00:03:32.620 --> 00:03:39.170
 once we get back to back 

00:03:35.170 --> 00:03:41.480
 back another opening and here we will be 

00:03:39.170 --> 00:03:44.480
 the initial folder in which we are 

00:03:41.480 --> 00:03:46.819
 104 will go here what comes 

00:03:44.480 --> 00:03:50.180
 being good 

00:03:46.819 --> 00:03:52.459
 and here we are going to paste the files that 

00:03:50.180 --> 00:03:53.569
 we copy from the crack folder we are going to 

00:03:52.459 --> 00:03:56.769
 give him in doing this for all 

00:03:53.569 --> 00:03:56.769
 current elements continue 

00:03:57.300 --> 00:04:03.300
 and it happens ok band is also very 

00:04:00.960 --> 00:04:05.220
 important to know this because because 

00:04:03.300 --> 00:04:06.750
 you also get another type of 

00:04:05.220 --> 00:04:10.590
 error that is being external is the 

00:04:06.750 --> 00:04:12.720
 I'm going to give you this project comes 

00:04:10.590 --> 00:04:16.410
 being this we execute this this access 

00:04:12.720 --> 00:04:17.940
 direct in which they draw from this that this 

00:04:16.410 --> 00:04:20.100
 they do not have to take the shortcut 

00:04:17.940 --> 00:04:21.900
 because it's going to throw them a mistake 

00:04:20.100 --> 00:04:27.000
 common and you 're also going to see if you do not 

00:04:21.900 --> 00:04:29.390
 strip is because it is very dog of a 

00:04:27.000 --> 00:04:29.390
 my mistake 

00:04:29.540 --> 00:04:35.270
 so that is also there are times that 

00:04:32.900 --> 00:04:38.980
 send that error because they are running 

00:04:35.270 --> 00:04:41.160
 a hitch an error 

00:04:38.980 --> 00:04:44.740
 they have to execute the shortcut 

00:04:41.160 --> 00:04:47.290
 inward and you have got to 

00:04:44.740 --> 00:04:50.380
 ask this skip a shortcut 

00:04:47.290 --> 00:04:51.670
 of these not because also when 

00:04:50.380 --> 00:04:53.770
 install the accounts to create an access 

00:04:51.670 --> 00:04:55.960
 direct get-to-work is fundamental in 

00:04:53.770 --> 00:04:57.610
 that erased the other like erasing it and 

00:04:55.960 --> 00:04:59.050
 where are the files but change 

00:04:57.610 --> 00:05:02.970
 club has to gather the public left to 

00:04:59.050 --> 00:05:04.660
 through where the files are 

00:05:02.970 --> 00:05:07.740
 Y 

00:05:04.660 --> 00:05:10.259
 but it's not in these band files 

00:05:07.740 --> 00:05:12.000
 they will create direct access from this that 

00:05:10.259 --> 00:05:14.430
 is the one that I have to outside ok for 

00:05:12.000 --> 00:05:16.860
 those who do not know need the 

00:05:14.430 --> 00:05:18.350
 direct access of this later as 

00:05:16.860 --> 00:05:21.750
 can see 

00:05:18.350 --> 00:05:23.100
 here is the 104 running 

00:05:21.750 --> 00:05:25.409
 I show you that he is with 

00:05:23.100 --> 00:05:29.809
 expansion download a little 

00:05:25.409 --> 00:05:29.809
 so that they see so that it comes 

00:05:30.040 --> 00:05:34.620
 also gives to avoid injuries that 

00:05:31.570 --> 00:05:34.620
 they may not be 

00:05:34.900 --> 00:05:38.900
 willis some power of germs in my 

00:05:37.700 --> 00:05:39.650
 comments for fatal that I ask 

00:05:38.900 --> 00:05:42.240
 very much 

00:05:39.650 --> 00:05:44.039
 on the comments 

00:05:42.240 --> 00:05:45.840
 in the video you can record for you 

00:05:44.039 --> 00:05:46.820
 when I have thought of a series of 

00:05:45.840 --> 00:05:49.430
 children 

00:05:46.820 --> 00:05:52.070
 I also plan to make a 

00:05:49.430 --> 00:05:57.400
 collaboration with a colleague of mine who 

00:05:52.070 --> 00:05:57.400
 the gamer calls his channel of destruction 

00:05:57.740 --> 00:06:01.340
 think with him 

00:06:01.700 --> 00:06:07.340
 it's more but I was not excellent 

00:06:08.670 --> 00:06:15.610
 is one more known than me green 

00:06:12.770 --> 00:06:15.610
 with tradition 

00:06:23.580 --> 00:06:26.210
 Italy 

00:06:29.409 --> 00:06:39.550
 that we mounted a 1 of this one did 

00:06:34.390 --> 00:06:41.140
 this is again is how to restart the 

00:06:39.550 --> 00:06:43.330
 team if you have to ride again but 

00:06:41.140 --> 00:06:45.600
 wait wait wait once 

00:06:43.330 --> 00:06:45.600
 open 

00:06:46.600 --> 00:06:49.530
 let's give it
