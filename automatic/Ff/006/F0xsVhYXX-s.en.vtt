so as you can see from the works you've
seen<00:01:26.730> today<00:01:26.880> I<00:01:27.030> now<00:01:27.390> predominantly<00:01:28.430> focus<00:01:29.430> on

00:01:29.570 --> 00:01:29.580 
seen today I now predominantly focus on

00:01:29.580 --> 00:01:31.880 
seen today I now predominantly focus on
the<00:01:29.820> natural<00:01:30.330> colors<00:01:30.600> of<00:01:30.690> the<00:01:30.780> metals<00:01:31.140> rather

00:01:31.880 --> 00:01:31.890 
the natural colors of the metals rather

00:01:31.890 --> 00:01:33.560 
the natural colors of the metals rather
than<00:01:32.100> paint<00:01:32.340> works<00:01:32.610> although<00:01:32.970> I<00:01:33.000> do<00:01:33.120> paint

00:01:33.560 --> 00:01:33.570 
than paint works although I do paint

00:01:33.570 --> 00:01:35.780 
than paint works although I do paint
works<00:01:33.870> in<00:01:34.200> you<00:01:34.530> know<00:01:34.740> bright<00:01:35.010> metallic<00:01:35.340> colors

00:01:35.780 --> 00:01:35.790 
works in you know bright metallic colors

00:01:35.790 --> 00:01:39.110 
works in you know bright metallic colors
if<00:01:35.970> I<00:01:36.120> think<00:01:36.840> it's<00:01:37.020> appropriate<00:01:37.940> and<00:01:38.940> when<00:01:39.090> I

00:01:39.110 --> 00:01:39.120 
if I think it's appropriate and when I

00:01:39.120 --> 00:01:40.640 
if I think it's appropriate and when I
work<00:01:39.360> with<00:01:39.540> the<00:01:39.750> natural<00:01:40.200> colors<00:01:40.470> of<00:01:40.500> the

00:01:40.640 --> 00:01:40.650 
work with the natural colors of the

00:01:40.650 --> 00:01:42.470 
work with the natural colors of the
metals<00:01:41.040> what<00:01:41.220> I<00:01:41.250> then<00:01:41.460> do<00:01:41.640> is<00:01:41.820> give<00:01:42.030> them<00:01:42.210> a

00:01:42.470 --> 00:01:42.480 
metals what I then do is give them a

00:01:42.480 --> 00:01:44.780 
metals what I then do is give them a
quart<00:01:42.960> of<00:01:43.110> a<00:01:43.200> clear<00:01:43.440> lacquer<00:01:43.710> and<00:01:44.160> that<00:01:44.550> just

00:01:44.780 --> 00:01:44.790 
quart of a clear lacquer and that just

00:01:44.790 --> 00:01:47.150 
quart of a clear lacquer and that just
provides<00:01:45.150> a<00:01:45.360> degree<00:01:45.630> of<00:01:46.020> protection<00:01:46.320> from<00:01:47.010> the

00:01:47.150 --> 00:01:47.160 
provides a degree of protection from the

00:01:47.160 --> 00:01:50.060 
provides a degree of protection from the
weather<00:01:47.280> I<00:01:47.700> would<00:01:48.000> say<00:01:48.180> from<00:01:49.070> finished

00:01:50.060 --> 00:01:50.070 
weather I would say from finished

00:01:50.070 --> 00:01:51.800 
weather I would say from finished
sculpture<00:01:50.430> I<00:01:50.550> think<00:01:50.880> my<00:01:51.090> favorite<00:01:51.480> has<00:01:51.570> got<00:01:51.600> to

sculpture I enjoy making the most is the

00:02:04.290 --> 00:02:07.520 
sculpture I enjoy making the most is the
lizard's<00:02:04.910> bicycle<00:02:05.910> chains<00:02:06.440> because<00:02:07.440> it's

00:02:07.520 --> 00:02:07.530 
lizard's bicycle chains because it's

00:02:07.530 --> 00:02:10.339 
lizard's bicycle chains because it's
just<00:02:07.680> nice<00:02:08.280> and<00:02:08.610> relaxing<00:02:09.119> it's<00:02:09.629> yeah<00:02:10.050> very

00:02:13.910 --> 00:02:13.920 
therapeutic to be making the works and

00:02:13.920 --> 00:02:15.080 
therapeutic to be making the works and
obviously<00:02:14.220> making<00:02:14.489> something<00:02:14.819> like

00:02:15.080 --> 00:02:15.090 
obviously making something like

Velociraptor or something like Arthur

00:02:17.340 --> 00:02:20.180 
Velociraptor or something like Arthur
here<00:02:17.550> involves<00:02:18.360> using<00:02:18.540> heavy<00:02:19.470> equipment<00:02:19.590> like

00:02:20.180 --> 00:02:20.190 
here involves using heavy equipment like

00:02:20.190 --> 00:02:23.750 
here involves using heavy equipment like
angle<00:02:20.670> grinders<00:02:21.180> a<00:02:21.450> lot<00:02:21.750> of<00:02:21.900> noise<00:02:22.760> whereas

00:02:23.750 --> 00:02:23.760 
angle grinders a lot of noise whereas

00:02:23.760 --> 00:02:25.610 
angle grinders a lot of noise whereas

kits
yeah<00:02:30.690> I<00:02:31.020> say<00:02:31.830> actually<00:02:32.280> making<00:02:32.490> the<00:02:32.820> lists<00:02:33.120> of

00:02:33.200 --> 00:02:33.210 
yeah I say actually making the lists of

00:02:33.210 --> 00:02:36.680 
yeah I say actually making the lists of
my<00:02:33.360> favorite<00:02:34.490> my<00:02:35.490> inspiration<00:02:36.120> is<00:02:36.240> originally

00:02:36.680 --> 00:02:36.690 
my favorite my inspiration is originally

00:02:36.690 --> 00:02:38.810 
my favorite my inspiration is originally
through<00:02:36.930> Commission's<00:02:37.440> so<00:02:38.100> people<00:02:38.520> will<00:02:38.700> ask

00:02:38.810 --> 00:02:38.820 
through Commission's so people will ask

00:02:38.820 --> 00:02:41.300 
through Commission's so people will ask
me<00:02:39.000> to<00:02:39.270> make<00:02:39.450> specific<00:02:40.170> animals<00:02:40.860> they've<00:02:41.130> got

00:02:41.300 --> 00:02:41.310 
me to make specific animals they've got

00:02:41.310 --> 00:02:43.880 
me to make specific animals they've got
an<00:02:41.610> affinity<00:02:41.850> for<00:02:42.150> it<00:02:42.390> and<00:02:43.020> then<00:02:43.260> obviously<00:02:43.590> if

00:02:43.880 --> 00:02:43.890 
an affinity for it and then obviously if

00:02:43.890 --> 00:02:46.070 
an affinity for it and then obviously if
that<00:02:43.920> sculpture<00:02:44.430> comes<00:02:44.730> out<00:02:44.910> well<00:02:45.150> pleased

00:02:46.070 --> 00:02:46.080 
that sculpture comes out well pleased

00:02:46.080 --> 00:02:47.840 
that sculpture comes out well pleased
with<00:02:46.260> the<00:02:46.320> results<00:02:46.680> and<00:02:46.830> I<00:02:47.070> think<00:02:47.640> there<00:02:47.760> might

00:02:47.840 --> 00:02:47.850 
with the results and I think there might

00:02:47.850 --> 00:02:50.410 
with the results and I think there might
be<00:02:47.910> wider<00:02:48.240> interests<00:02:48.660> then<00:02:49.050> I'll<00:02:49.500> make<00:02:49.890> more

00:02:50.410 --> 00:02:50.420 
be wider interests then I'll make more

00:02:50.420 --> 00:02:53.390 
be wider interests then I'll make more
sculptures<00:02:51.420> around<00:02:51.900> that<00:02:52.350> theme<00:02:52.680> but<00:02:53.130> the
