00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.310
 9 today's video and something more special 

00:00:03.270 --> 00:00:07.379
 because I was thinking of one 

00:00:05.310 --> 00:00:10.679
 to open a new rubric which I want 

00:00:07.379 --> 00:00:12.059
 oscar will call lunch, and yet 

00:00:10.679 --> 00:00:15.420
 be the first challenge while 

00:00:12.059 --> 00:00:16.680
 within ten minutes if possible 

00:00:15.420 --> 00:00:20.070
 earn a lot of gold 

00:00:16.680 --> 00:00:22.859
 the only condition is that here 

00:00:20.070 --> 00:00:24.840
 Open free game and all alone 

00:00:22.859 --> 00:00:26.250
 on the map since that is her ford 

00:00:24.840 --> 00:00:28.019
 or destroy tower or whatever 

00:00:26.250 --> 00:00:29.789
 that is I do not care it's me 

00:00:28.019 --> 00:00:32.070
 no matter which champion you take 

00:00:29.789 --> 00:00:33.989
 or which charmers to was high 

00:00:32.070 --> 00:00:35.850
 whatever the only thing 

00:00:33.989 --> 00:00:39.660
 It's how much gold you look at 

00:00:35.850 --> 00:00:41.489
 you have it exactly at ten minutes so it 

00:00:39.660 --> 00:00:43.379
 So it can make sense that you are 

00:00:41.489 --> 00:00:45.480
 no item at the beginning picks up because he 

00:00:43.379 --> 00:00:49.020
 course city ​​school with 475 gold 

00:00:45.480 --> 00:00:52.949
 That's exactly what the change is 

00:00:49.020 --> 00:00:54.180
 very simple and the nomination of the 

00:00:52.949 --> 00:00:55.620
 winner or the 

00:00:54.180 --> 00:00:57.629
 reigning champions 

00:00:55.620 --> 00:00:59.640
 you can do this if you want 

00:00:57.629 --> 00:01:02.070
 that he is almost the first option 

00:00:59.640 --> 00:01:04.890
 Upload a video yourself that means that 

00:01:02.070 --> 00:01:06.240
 from the recorder the game starts and 

00:01:04.890 --> 00:01:07.710
 had to rewind that is 

00:01:06.240 --> 00:01:09.390
 It does not matter, but I only want to 

00:01:07.710 --> 00:01:11.580
 see you at ten minutes and before 

00:01:09.390 --> 00:01:12.320
 all things without that is just something 

00:01:11.580 --> 00:01:14.760
 see is 

00:01:12.320 --> 00:01:16.020
 at ten minutes I'll look like 

00:01:14.760 --> 00:01:17.850
 had a lot of gold 

00:01:16.020 --> 00:01:19.439
 that means you can upload the video 

00:01:17.850 --> 00:01:20.580
 to send video answer now i 

00:01:19.439 --> 00:01:22.140
 I will then look at it all 

00:01:20.580 --> 00:01:23.450
 conditions are fulfilled and it 

00:01:22.140 --> 00:01:25.860
 accept 

00:01:23.450 --> 00:01:28.290
 That's one way or that 

00:01:25.860 --> 00:01:30.240
 you send me over the player recorder 

00:01:28.290 --> 00:01:31.950
 quite simply the file where he does that 

00:01:30.240 --> 00:01:33.360
 beer april some players 

00:01:31.950 --> 00:01:35.310
 or the challenge fulfilled 

00:01:33.360 --> 00:01:36.900
 have to me or to the 

00:01:35.310 --> 00:01:39.210
 who wants to see the bottom address must then 

00:01:36.900 --> 00:01:40.909
 I think one more but it will 

00:01:39.210 --> 00:01:43.170
 Definitely one to see and 

00:01:40.909 --> 00:01:44.880
 while I will in any case look what 

00:01:43.170 --> 00:01:46.409
 you do it and I will do that then 

00:01:44.880 --> 00:01:48.570
 then upload respectively 

00:01:46.409 --> 00:01:50.640
 first one did not have a large amount of it 

00:01:48.570 --> 00:01:53.250
 especially not to expect anyway 

00:01:50.640 --> 00:01:55.770
 the reigning good works well 

00:01:53.250 --> 00:01:57.360
 champion is always in the in the 

00:01:55.770 --> 00:01:59.470
 Title description to be seen 

00:01:57.360 --> 00:02:01.090
 You can decide for yourself 

00:01:59.470 --> 00:02:03.010
 Just ask if he is with us 

00:02:01.090 --> 00:02:04.120
 want to see companies respectively 

00:02:03.010 --> 00:02:06.640
 a real name probably 

00:02:04.120 --> 00:02:08.619
 not or and youtube channel that is 

00:02:06.640 --> 00:02:09.970
 You can about this video advertising for 

00:02:08.619 --> 00:02:11.980
 make you as well as the video 

00:02:09.970 --> 00:02:16.240
 Answer that is perfect for me 

00:02:11.980 --> 00:02:19.360
 That's exactly what it was 

00:02:16.240 --> 00:02:20.920
 So try to be creative and everyone 

00:02:19.360 --> 00:02:22.330
 things that I'm now almost the form 

00:02:20.920 --> 00:02:24.010
 I forgot to call you in 

00:02:22.330 --> 00:02:26.410
 the video description stand that is 

00:02:24.010 --> 00:02:28.480
 be creative look what is the best 

00:02:26.410 --> 00:02:30.820
 possibility or can go down in 

00:02:28.480 --> 00:02:33.400
 discuss the comments about what 

00:02:30.820 --> 00:02:35.680
 because the best tactic could be because 

00:02:33.400 --> 00:02:37.990
 everything that brings money is valuable and 

00:02:35.680 --> 00:02:39.430
 It is exactly watched in ten minutes 

00:02:37.990 --> 00:02:43.690
