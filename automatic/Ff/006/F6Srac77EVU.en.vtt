 dota staples today we're in regular 

00:00:16.219 --> 00:00:20.240
 let's talk about a difficult line 

00:00:17.930 --> 00:00:22.189
 or rather, how important it is to include in your 

00:00:20.240 --> 00:00:24.200
 hardliner action game plan 

00:00:22.189 --> 00:00:28.840
 and how important is hardliners as possible 

00:00:24.200 --> 00:00:28.840
 quickly and well perform their task 

00:00:35.250 --> 00:00:39.340
 match which we will make out 

00:00:37.060 --> 00:00:42.100
 took place in mid-April as part of 

00:00:39.340 --> 00:00:44.410
 vipe game about leagues or rather in her 

00:00:42.100 --> 00:00:46.480
 group stage interesting games there was 

00:00:44.410 --> 00:00:48.610
 very little but the first game don't ruin yang 

00:00:46.480 --> 00:00:49.120
 against bret hart I remember very much 

00:00:48.610 --> 00:00:51.610
 OK 

00:00:49.120 --> 00:00:53.590
 both teams decided to play strong 

00:00:51.610 --> 00:00:55.990
 triple on easy that complicated the task 

00:00:53.590 --> 00:00:57.820
 hardliners in almost any game 

00:00:55.990 --> 00:01:00.400
 the task of the hero is difficult 

00:00:57.820 --> 00:01:02.740
 getting as high as possible in 

00:01:00.400 --> 00:01:04.930
 At the beginning of the game, he tries as 

00:01:02.740 --> 00:01:07.479
 it is possible to distract saports more and deprive 

00:01:04.930 --> 00:01:09.490
 their farm or shaft by tapping the first 

00:01:07.479 --> 00:01:12.369
 done in order to start faster 

00:01:09.490 --> 00:01:14.590
 perform your game task second for 

00:01:12.369 --> 00:01:16.619
 the opponent's support could not 

00:01:14.590 --> 00:01:19.030
 gank and play your part in the game 

00:01:16.619 --> 00:01:20.860
 Centaur's task is to get 

00:01:19.030 --> 00:01:23.320
 the sixth level while he is 

00:01:20.860 --> 00:01:25.210
 relatively tight hero without escape 

00:01:23.320 --> 00:01:27.220
 early on and can receive 

00:01:25.210 --> 00:01:29.410
 level only due to opponent's error 

00:01:27.220 --> 00:01:31.390
 need to say that newbies support 

00:01:29.410 --> 00:01:33.250
 played pretty bad at the beginning of what 

00:01:31.390 --> 00:01:34.360
 gave the centaur get quite a lot 

00:01:33.250 --> 00:01:37.000
 free xp 

00:01:34.360 --> 00:01:39.310
 moreover the centaur was given to put ward 

00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:41.759
 beat vision on the line so he 

00:01:39.310 --> 00:01:44.289
 could fully control the situation and 

00:01:41.759 --> 00:01:46.479
 furion everything was much harder since 

00:01:44.289 --> 00:01:48.759
 ward he would not be given if he 

00:01:46.479 --> 00:01:49.690
 put in front of jagger goods here 

00:01:48.759 --> 00:01:52.149
 would have been shot down 

00:01:49.690 --> 00:01:54.429
 and the opponent's support did everything very much 

00:01:52.149 --> 00:01:56.440
 not bad however he was able to get 

00:01:54.429 --> 00:01:58.979
 your level and join the game before in 

00:01:56.440 --> 00:02:02.590
 great advantage to your team 

00:01:58.979 --> 00:02:05.170
 first 456 sends its trent 

00:02:02.590 --> 00:02:07.210
 meet a pack of creeps thereby push 

00:02:05.170 --> 00:02:09.819
 his i line in the direction of the opponent's armpit 

00:02:07.210 --> 00:02:12.360
 which will then allow from pushing the line in 

00:02:09.819 --> 00:02:12.360
 its side 

00:02:18.569 --> 00:02:24.010
 further it is impossible to allow support from 

00:02:21.519 --> 00:02:26.730
 bullet a pack of creeps in the courtyard spa with what 

00:02:24.010 --> 00:02:28.959
 partially copes in 1 stub of freon a 

00:02:26.730 --> 00:02:35.109
 the only bullet of shiva creep 

00:02:28.959 --> 00:02:37.390
 overheats 2 stump Furion gets 3 

00:02:35.109 --> 00:02:39.909
 level from riga him itmo well and stands under 

00:02:37.390 --> 00:02:42.099
 a tower simply because its task is to 

00:02:39.909 --> 00:02:44.379
 of this minute task is now performed 

00:02:42.099 --> 00:02:48.359
 teams include him in the game first 

00:02:44.379 --> 00:02:48.359
 Fabo on sniper becomes connected 

00:02:55.880 --> 00:03:01.580
 and the second push of the bottom product with a fall 

00:02:59.630 --> 00:03:04.330
 which brewmaster gets super 

00:03:01.580 --> 00:03:04.330
 early blink 

00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:23.680
 this way due to the fact that 456 on 

00:03:21.730 --> 00:03:26.170
 wagon they tried a little and showed 

00:03:23.680 --> 00:03:28.390
 magnificent manipulation of the mind by us in 

00:03:26.170 --> 00:03:30.790
 the first minutes of the game new being able to 

00:03:28.390 --> 00:03:33.400
 get a good start and develop it for 

00:03:30.790 --> 00:03:34.260
 account of the potential of its peak that brought 

00:03:33.400 --> 00:03:36.790
 they win 

00:03:34.260 --> 00:03:39.040
 Starting a game in dota 2 often has 

00:03:36.790 --> 00:03:41.080
 tremendous value and very important 

00:03:39.040 --> 00:03:43.450
 to make your hardliner 

00:03:41.080 --> 00:03:45.250
 Newbye implemented anyway 

00:03:43.450 --> 00:03:47.590
 demonstrated stunning 

00:03:45.250 --> 00:03:49.870
 interaction realizing every bit 

00:03:47.590 --> 00:03:52.200
 experience obtained by freon in the first few minutes 

00:03:49.870 --> 00:03:52.200
