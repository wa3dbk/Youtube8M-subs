00:01:50.840 --> 00:01:50.850 
clean and just nice and refreshing so I

00:01:50.850 --> 00:01:53.090 
clean and just nice and refreshing so I
really<00:01:51.119> set<00:01:51.450> and<00:01:51.720> when<00:01:52.470> I<00:01:52.500> tried<00:01:52.770> this<00:01:52.890> on<00:01:53.040> my

00:01:53.090 --> 00:01:53.100 
really set and when I tried this on my

00:01:53.100 --> 00:01:55.100 
really set and when I tried this on my
hair<00:01:53.430> it<00:01:53.640> in<00:01:54.210> the<00:01:54.299> other<00:01:54.509> very<00:01:54.899> much

00:01:55.100 --> 00:01:55.110 
hair it in the other very much

00:01:55.110 --> 00:01:56.840 
hair it in the other very much
and<00:01:55.350> when<00:01:55.530> I<00:01:55.560> washed<00:01:55.799> it<00:01:55.950> off<00:01:56.070> my<00:01:56.280> hair<00:01:56.520> felt

00:01:56.840 --> 00:01:56.850 
and when I washed it off my hair felt

00:01:56.850 --> 00:01:58.550 
and when I washed it off my hair felt
clean<00:01:57.149> but<00:01:57.450> it<00:01:57.540> didn't<00:01:57.750> feel<00:01:57.840> squeaky<00:01:58.290> clean

00:01:58.550 --> 00:01:58.560 
clean but it didn't feel squeaky clean

00:01:58.560 --> 00:02:01.609 
clean but it didn't feel squeaky clean
so<00:01:58.890> that's<00:01:59.070> a<00:01:59.159> good<00:01:59.310> sign<00:01:59.549> so<00:02:00.509> I<00:02:00.869> think<00:02:00.960> this<00:02:01.409> is

00:02:01.609 --> 00:02:01.619 
so that's a good sign so I think this is

00:02:01.619 --> 00:02:04.940 
so that's a good sign so I think this is
a<00:02:01.890> nice<00:02:02.820> sulfate<00:02:03.390> free<00:02:03.540> shampoo<00:02:03.960> that's<00:02:04.439> that

00:02:04.940 --> 00:02:04.950 
a nice sulfate free shampoo that's that

00:02:04.950 --> 00:02:06.560 
a nice sulfate free shampoo that's that
it<00:02:05.100> doesn't<00:02:05.430> strip<00:02:05.670> everything<00:02:06.030> out<00:02:06.329> of<00:02:06.390> my

00:02:06.560 --> 00:02:06.570 
it doesn't strip everything out of my

00:02:06.570 --> 00:02:09.710 
it doesn't strip everything out of my
