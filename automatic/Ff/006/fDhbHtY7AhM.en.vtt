in a basketball game this year when you

00:01:21.750 --> 00:01:23.780 
in a basketball game this year when you
have<00:01:21.869> a<00:01:21.900> whole<00:01:22.110> year<00:01:22.439> to<00:01:22.470> really<00:01:23.340> integrate<00:01:23.549> it

00:01:23.780 --> 00:01:23.790 
have a whole year to really integrate it

00:01:23.790 --> 00:01:25.070 
have a whole year to really integrate it
properly<00:01:24.240> that's<00:01:24.390> when<00:01:24.540> you're<00:01:24.630> gonna<00:01:24.720> see<00:01:24.960> it

00:01:25.070 --> 00:01:25.080 
properly that's when you're gonna see it

00:01:25.080 --> 00:01:26.330 
properly that's when you're gonna see it
really<00:01:25.290> come<00:01:25.439> to<00:01:25.500> fruition<00:01:25.530> you<00:01:26.009> really<00:01:26.189> come

00:01:26.330 --> 00:01:26.340 
really come to fruition you really come

00:01:26.340 --> 00:01:28.520 
really come to fruition you really come
to<00:01:26.430> the<00:01:26.520> forefront<00:01:26.729> and<00:01:27.090> then<00:01:27.600> every<00:01:28.140> game<00:01:28.350> is

00:01:28.520 --> 00:01:28.530 
to the forefront and then every game is

00:01:28.530 --> 00:01:30.440 
to the forefront and then every game is
gonna<00:01:28.680> really<00:01:29.280> just<00:01:29.729> come<00:01:29.850> to<00:01:29.970> life<00:01:30.119> because

00:01:30.440 --> 00:01:30.450 
gonna really just come to life because

00:01:30.450 --> 00:01:32.120 
gonna really just come to life because
then<00:01:30.810> the<00:01:30.930> players<00:01:31.140> start<00:01:31.409> to<00:01:31.470> play<00:01:31.619> more<00:01:31.860> true

00:01:32.120 --> 00:01:32.130 
then the players start to play more true

00:01:32.130 --> 00:01:34.010 
then the players start to play more true
to<00:01:32.189> themselves<00:01:32.579> and<00:01:32.909> so<00:01:33.479> when<00:01:33.720> you<00:01:33.810> have<00:01:33.930> the

00:01:34.010 --> 00:01:34.020 
to themselves and so when you have the

00:01:34.020 --> 00:01:35.480 
to themselves and so when you have the
move<00:01:34.170> the<00:01:34.439> movement<00:01:34.680> of<00:01:34.770> the<00:01:34.829> players<00:01:35.040> start

00:01:35.480 --> 00:01:35.490 
move the movement of the players start

00:01:35.490 --> 00:01:37.340 
move the movement of the players start
to<00:01:35.670> really<00:01:35.850> mimic<00:01:36.240> they're<00:01:36.990> true<00:01:37.200> to<00:01:37.229> life

00:01:37.340 --> 00:01:37.350 
to really mimic they're true to life

00:01:37.350 --> 00:01:39.950 
to really mimic they're true to life
play<00:01:37.710> sets<00:01:38.009> and<00:01:38.280> where<00:01:39.030> they<00:01:39.150> really<00:01:39.450> you<00:01:39.930> know

00:01:39.950 --> 00:01:39.960 
play sets and where they really you know

00:01:39.960 --> 00:01:42.530 
play sets and where they really you know
go<00:01:40.320> to<00:01:40.380> be<00:01:40.950> successful<00:01:41.490> then<00:01:41.939> the<00:01:42.119> game<00:01:42.270> really

00:01:42.530 --> 00:01:42.540 
go to be successful then the game really

00:01:42.540 --> 00:01:43.819 
go to be successful then the game really
starts<00:01:42.689> to<00:01:42.840> again<00:01:43.200> take<00:01:43.470> that<00:01:43.619> next<00:01:43.770> step

00:01:43.819 --> 00:01:43.829 
starts to again take that next step

00:01:43.829 --> 00:01:45.620 
starts to again take that next step
towards<00:01:44.189> authenticity<00:01:44.490> the<00:01:45.299> game<00:01:45.479> does<00:01:45.600> a

00:01:45.620 --> 00:01:45.630 
towards authenticity the game does a

00:01:45.630 --> 00:01:47.749 
towards authenticity the game does a
really<00:01:45.810> good<00:01:45.990> job<00:01:46.140> of<00:01:46.430> basically<00:01:47.430> giving<00:01:47.670> you

00:01:47.749 --> 00:01:47.759 
really good job of basically giving you

00:01:47.759 --> 00:01:50.240 
really good job of basically giving you
success<00:01:48.180> or<00:01:48.720> failure<00:01:49.170> based<00:01:49.590> on<00:01:49.799> whether<00:01:50.100> you

00:01:50.240 --> 00:01:50.250 
success or failure based on whether you

00:01:50.250 --> 00:01:53.280 
success or failure based on whether you
play<00:01:50.399> to<00:01:50.460> those<00:01:50.610> team<00:01:50.820> strengths<00:01:51.180> or<00:01:51.270> not

00:01:53.280 --> 00:01:53.290 
play to those team strengths or not

00:01:53.290 --> 00:01:55.540 
play to those team strengths or not
yeah<00:01:54.290> I<00:01:54.320> think<00:01:54.500> people<00:01:54.950> you<00:01:55.130> know<00:01:55.250> when<00:01:55.520> they

00:01:55.540 --> 00:01:55.550 
yeah I think people you know when they

00:01:55.550 --> 00:01:57.820 
yeah I think people you know when they
kind<00:01:56.000> of<00:01:56.060> write<00:01:56.180> off<00:01:56.210> live<00:01:56.540> because<00:01:57.050> it<00:01:57.320> didn't

00:01:57.820 --> 00:01:57.830 
kind of write off live because it didn't

00:01:57.830 --> 00:01:59.800 
kind of write off live because it didn't
play<00:01:58.070> you<00:01:58.850> didn't<00:01:59.030> play<00:01:59.210> well<00:01:59.390> it<00:01:59.570> didn't

00:01:59.800 --> 00:01:59.810 
play you didn't play well it didn't

00:01:59.810 --> 00:02:01.990 
play you didn't play well it didn't
control<00:02:00.140> well<00:02:00.410> and<00:02:00.729> but<00:02:01.729> if<00:02:01.820> you<00:02:01.880> actually

00:02:01.990 --> 00:02:02.000 
control well and but if you actually

00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:03.910 
control well and but if you actually
look<00:02:02.180> at<00:02:02.360> under<00:02:03.140> the<00:02:03.170> hood<00:02:03.440> and<00:02:03.620> look<00:02:03.710> at<00:02:03.830> the

00:02:03.910 --> 00:02:03.920 
look at under the hood and look at the

00:02:03.920 --> 00:02:06.460 
look at under the hood and look at the
tech<00:02:04.130> and<00:02:04.370> look<00:02:04.550> at<00:02:04.729> what<00:02:05.720> the<00:02:05.810> AI<00:02:05.930> was

00:02:06.460 --> 00:02:06.470 
tech and look at what the AI was

00:02:06.470 --> 00:02:08.080 
tech and look at what the AI was
architected<00:02:06.920> to<00:02:07.100> do<00:02:07.280> it's<00:02:07.610> actually<00:02:07.909> quite

00:02:08.080 --> 00:02:08.090 
architected to do it's actually quite

00:02:08.090 --> 00:02:09.370 
architected to do it's actually quite
impressive<00:02:08.420> and<00:02:08.750> there's<00:02:09.050> some<00:02:09.170> really

00:02:09.370 --> 00:02:09.380 
impressive and there's some really

00:02:09.380 --> 00:02:11.860 
impressive and there's some really
really<00:02:09.530> smart<00:02:10.190> basketball<00:02:10.490> guys<00:02:10.850> here<00:02:11.150> guys

00:02:11.860 --> 00:02:11.870 
really smart basketball guys here guys

00:02:11.870 --> 00:02:13.270 
really smart basketball guys here guys
who<00:02:11.990> played<00:02:12.200> a<00:02:12.230> very<00:02:12.440> high<00:02:12.590> level<00:02:12.709> ball<00:02:13.100> and

who played a very high level ball and
they<00:02:13.370> really<00:02:13.670> get<00:02:13.910> that<00:02:14.180> it's<00:02:14.750> just<00:02:14.959> kind<00:02:15.080> of<00:02:15.110> a

00:02:15.190 --> 00:02:15.200 
they really get that it's just kind of a

00:02:15.200 --> 00:02:16.480 
they really get that it's just kind of a
shame<00:02:15.380> that<00:02:15.410> most<00:02:15.650> people<00:02:15.920> didn't<00:02:16.130> give<00:02:16.310> live

00:02:16.480 --> 00:02:16.490 
shame that most people didn't give live

00:02:16.490 --> 00:02:19.210 
shame that most people didn't give live
time<00:02:16.790> and<00:02:17.780> they<00:02:18.050> look<00:02:18.230> past<00:02:18.380> kind<00:02:18.770> of<00:02:18.830> the<00:02:18.950> the

00:02:19.210 --> 00:02:19.220 
time and they look past kind of the the

00:02:19.220 --> 00:02:21.250 
time and they look past kind of the the
surface<00:02:19.430> and<00:02:19.760> the<00:02:19.820> aesthetics<00:02:20.240> and<00:02:20.390> see<00:02:21.140> with

00:02:21.250 --> 00:02:21.260 
surface and the aesthetics and see with

00:02:21.260 --> 00:02:22.480 
surface and the aesthetics and see with
a<00:02:21.290> I<00:02:21.410> was<00:02:21.590> doing<00:02:21.800> underneath<00:02:22.100> because<00:02:22.160> it<00:02:22.370> was

00:02:22.480 --> 00:02:22.490 
a I was doing underneath because it was

00:02:22.490 --> 00:02:25.420 
a I was doing underneath because it was
really<00:02:22.670> strong<00:02:23.110> that<00:02:24.110> being<00:02:24.290> said<00:02:24.470> I<00:02:24.739> think<00:02:24.890> we

00:02:25.420 --> 00:02:25.430 
really strong that being said I think we

00:02:25.430 --> 00:02:27.190 
really strong that being said I think we
really<00:02:25.670> went<00:02:26.000> and<00:02:26.209> taking<00:02:26.570> that<00:02:26.720> extra<00:02:26.870> leap

00:02:27.190 --> 00:02:27.200 
really went and taking that extra leap

00:02:27.200 --> 00:02:29.740 
really went and taking that extra leap
forward<00:02:27.620> now<00:02:28.130> to<00:02:28.160> make<00:02:28.700> sure<00:02:28.850> that<00:02:29.000> again<00:02:29.480> the

00:02:29.740 --> 00:02:29.750 
forward now to make sure that again the

00:02:29.750 --> 00:02:31.930 
forward now to make sure that again the
off<00:02:29.840> ball<00:02:30.050> movement<00:02:30.380> was<00:02:30.500> there<00:02:30.709> that<00:02:31.670> the

00:02:31.930 --> 00:02:31.940 
off ball movement was there that the

00:02:31.940 --> 00:02:33.940 
off ball movement was there that the
game<00:02:32.180> the<00:02:32.480> game<00:02:32.780> level<00:02:33.050> stuff<00:02:33.320> like<00:02:33.680> all<00:02:33.830> the

00:02:33.940 --> 00:02:33.950 
game the game level stuff like all the

00:02:33.950 --> 00:02:35.830 
game the game level stuff like all the
moves<00:02:34.130> you<00:02:34.250> can<00:02:34.370> do<00:02:34.550> that<00:02:34.910> stuff<00:02:35.150> was<00:02:35.300> solid<00:02:35.660> so

00:02:35.830 --> 00:02:35.840 
moves you can do that stuff was solid so

00:02:35.840 --> 00:02:37.780 
moves you can do that stuff was solid so
as<00:02:35.959> you<00:02:36.080> play<00:02:36.290> the<00:02:36.440> game<00:02:36.590> now<00:02:36.770> you're<00:02:37.430> not<00:02:37.550> held

00:02:37.780 --> 00:02:37.790 
as you play the game now you're not held

00:02:37.790 --> 00:02:39.610 
as you play the game now you're not held
back<00:02:38.000> by<00:02:38.180> that<00:02:38.330> from<00:02:38.810> a<00:02:38.870> perception<00:02:39.170> you're

00:02:39.610 --> 00:02:39.620 
back by that from a perception you're

00:02:39.620 --> 00:02:41.170 
back by that from a perception you're
not<00:02:39.739> really<00:02:39.890> held<00:02:40.100> back<00:02:40.310> by<00:02:40.520> this<00:02:40.970> game

00:02:41.170 --> 00:02:41.180 
not really held back by this game

00:02:41.180 --> 00:02:43.300 
not really held back by this game
doesn't<00:02:41.450> look<00:02:41.480> like<00:02:41.690> basketball<00:02:42.140> so<00:02:42.650> it<00:02:43.100> must

00:02:43.300 --> 00:02:43.310 
doesn't look like basketball so it must

00:02:43.310 --> 00:02:45.130 
doesn't look like basketball so it must
not<00:02:43.370> be<00:02:43.550> basketball<00:02:43.910> now<00:02:44.480> now<00:02:44.750> that<00:02:44.900> looks

00:02:45.130 --> 00:02:45.140 
not be basketball now now that looks

00:02:45.140 --> 00:02:47.140 
not be basketball now now that looks
like<00:02:45.230> basketball<00:02:45.739> and<00:02:45.830> it<00:02:45.920> feels<00:02:46.220> good<00:02:46.489> you

00:02:47.140 --> 00:02:47.150

like basketball and it feels good you
start<00:02:47.300> to<00:02:47.450> see<00:02:47.630> really<00:02:48.260> under<00:02:48.650> the<00:02:48.680> hood<00:02:48.950> a<00:02:49.130> I

00:02:49.150 --> 00:02:49.160 
start to see really under the hood a I

00:02:49.160 --> 00:02:51.310 
start to see really under the hood a I
really<00:02:49.730> shine<00:02:49.910> forth<00:02:50.330> and<00:02:50.570> it<00:02:50.810> it's<00:02:51.170> really
