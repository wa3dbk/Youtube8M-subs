00:00:04.990 --> 00:00:07.990
 Yup 

00:00:09.780 --> 00:00:14.129
 outside of lawn 

00:00:16.930 --> 00:00:21.260
 others without another with this new one 

00:00:19.730 --> 00:00:23.869
 videos are here today with the fourth 

00:00:21.260 --> 00:00:26.779
 episode of the interview series jtf ci 

00:00:23.869 --> 00:00:29.869
 I'm here with silver girls of age 

00:00:26.779 --> 00:00:31.550
 gilbert and today we will go precisely 

00:00:29.869 --> 00:00:32.660
 interview him have it you chose them 

00:00:31.550 --> 00:00:34.640
 I also asked questions 

00:00:32.660 --> 00:00:36.680
 quite interesting except for one 

00:00:34.640 --> 00:00:39.050
 silver wondered who made it 

00:00:36.680 --> 00:00:41.720
 then the writer of that question 

00:00:39.050 --> 00:00:44.649
 could reveal his identity in 

00:00:41.720 --> 00:00:46.970
 comments however then you will see from you 

00:00:44.649 --> 00:00:48.379
 an overpressure image and who has 

00:00:46.970 --> 00:00:49.850
 however, the question was obviously not 

00:00:48.379 --> 00:00:52.399
 the name was written in particular 

00:00:49.850 --> 00:00:54.109
 so if he wants he can reveal the Swiss 

00:00:52.399 --> 00:00:57.350
 then I would say he was ready 

00:00:54.109 --> 00:00:59.660
 we can start right away 

00:00:57.350 --> 00:01:02.030
 then the first question says how many 

00:00:59.660 --> 00:01:03.620
 nuclear I move to uk you did and why 

00:01:02.030 --> 00:01:07.610
 let's not even put the range at least 

00:01:03.620 --> 00:01:10.790
 you are happy that then core 20 

00:01:07.610 --> 00:01:12.110
 talk about two around 200 now 

00:01:10.790 --> 00:01:15.770
 I don't know because I have various accounts 

00:01:12.110 --> 00:01:19.960
 while for fashions phenomenon but also there 

00:01:15.770 --> 00:01:22.900
 however return 200 that 

00:01:19.960 --> 00:01:24.909
 around 300 of 280 to the power of the 

00:01:22.900 --> 00:01:26.380
 genre while new clio played 

00:01:24.909 --> 00:01:28.300
 really very little for her 

00:01:26.380 --> 00:01:31.240
 players I played pretty well 

00:01:28.300 --> 00:01:33.330
 so nuke not even so many anyway 

00:01:31.240 --> 00:01:37.240
 around the hundreds 

00:01:33.330 --> 00:01:38.619
 ok perfect the second question says what 

00:01:37.240 --> 00:01:40.690
 was your first video game in 

00:01:38.619 --> 00:01:42.759
 general and then there will be another 

00:01:40.690 --> 00:01:43.330
 question that will ask what was yours 

00:01:42.759 --> 00:01:45.240
 first cod 

00:01:43.330 --> 00:01:48.310
 we'll see that later, obviously 

00:01:45.240 --> 00:01:52.360
 video game about the console 

00:01:48.310 --> 00:01:55.690
 playstation store while concerning 

00:01:52.360 --> 00:01:56.619
 little my video game than with all of them 

00:01:55.690 --> 00:01:58.240
 how many consoles 

00:01:56.619 --> 00:02:01.050
 considering also console time it is 

00:01:58.240 --> 00:02:05.500
 been super mario bros 

00:02:01.050 --> 00:02:09.489
 the classic game boy toys 

00:02:05.500 --> 00:02:11.280
 begins with which he is then the third 

00:02:09.489 --> 00:02:13.260
 question 

00:02:11.280 --> 00:02:15.360
 is divided into two questions and the first of 

00:02:13.260 --> 00:02:18.140
 she asks how long she is a part of 

00:02:15.360 --> 00:02:20.870
 of the clan and flaws 

00:02:18.140 --> 00:02:25.430
 I do not find I believe a month and a half two 

00:02:20.870 --> 00:02:27.370
 around here while he followed it and it would be 

00:02:25.430 --> 00:02:31.040
 why are you passionate about cod 

00:02:27.370 --> 00:02:33.540
 enjoy it now I'm just passionate about it 

00:02:31.040 --> 00:02:35.400
 neither of them changes that I like 

00:02:33.540 --> 00:02:36.510
 however this follows develops 

00:02:35.400 --> 00:02:38.609
 initially for a tube 

00:02:36.510 --> 00:02:40.200
 passionate about writing you two values 

00:02:38.609 --> 00:02:42.450
 that this is not enough 

00:02:40.200 --> 00:02:45.480
 well let's say he likes to shoot the 

00:02:42.450 --> 00:02:47.790
 all people 

00:02:45.480 --> 00:02:50.209
 the fourth question says how do you do it a 

00:02:47.790 --> 00:02:53.849
 keep screaming so high and this is it 

00:02:50.209 --> 00:02:56.519
 would be the question referred to silver 

00:02:53.849 --> 00:03:02.099
 would like to know the writer here 

00:02:56.519 --> 00:03:04.250
 the author of this question please do 

00:03:02.099 --> 00:03:06.450
 from sportypal we tell them that 

00:03:04.250 --> 00:03:08.159
 the only time I do it is here 

00:03:06.450 --> 00:03:10.139
 just the annoying writing 

00:03:08.159 --> 00:03:12.120
 steer in already started matches 

00:03:10.139 --> 00:03:13.620
 so that is why you take a defeat 

00:03:12.120 --> 00:03:15.290
 because I wanted slow from Piacenza 

00:03:13.620 --> 00:03:17.639
 Milan also a little annoyed then 

00:03:15.290 --> 00:03:19.169
 I sportingly as in that case if 

00:03:17.639 --> 00:03:21.250
 no you play the young man normally 

00:03:19.169 --> 00:03:23.860
 anyway 

00:03:21.250 --> 00:03:25.240
 nothing paid so much else I keep 

00:03:23.860 --> 00:03:27.640
 however I play most of the 

00:03:25.240 --> 00:03:30.070
 times in Series B group game in January 

00:03:27.640 --> 00:03:31.570
 only sneijder account only so 

00:03:30.070 --> 00:03:33.820
 that still doesn't ruin me here 

00:03:31.570 --> 00:03:35.640
 because I am one of those attached to 

00:03:33.820 --> 00:03:40.120
 statistics 

00:03:35.640 --> 00:03:42.250
 ok perfect the fifth question asks 

00:03:40.120 --> 00:03:45.670
 what was your first string here is the 

00:03:42.250 --> 00:03:49.420
 whose echo is my first goal aroused mv 

00:03:45.670 --> 00:03:51.160
 tele would also be ok perfect 

00:03:49.420 --> 00:03:54.459
 they arrive immediately to the sixth and last 

00:03:51.160 --> 00:03:56.110
 question that asks you costs has pushed you to 

00:03:54.459 --> 00:03:59.050
 enter this clan obviously yes 

00:03:56.110 --> 00:04:01.660
 speaks of jtf then pushed into 

00:03:59.050 --> 00:04:04.570
 this big don't say that below 

00:04:01.660 --> 00:04:06.520
 like myths like you say they didn't have 

00:04:04.570 --> 00:04:08.440
 never managed to reach levels vi 

00:04:06.520 --> 00:04:10.540
 they had young furniture I told you to 

00:04:08.440 --> 00:04:12.489
 How the heck does this but these things the 

00:04:10.540 --> 00:04:15.160
 I said that it really ca n't but it is 

00:04:12.489 --> 00:04:17.980
 been too strong then going on by 

00:04:15.160 --> 00:04:20.410
 diamonds going forward over time because 

00:04:17.980 --> 00:04:22.419
 parking me uncle and moving on 

00:04:20.410 --> 00:04:25.980
 in the minutes time he realized that 

00:04:22.419 --> 00:04:28.350
 enough brown awareness of me 

00:04:25.980 --> 00:04:31.710
 his black ops where I improved 

00:04:28.350 --> 00:04:33.450
 compared to the three things have emerged are 

00:04:31.710 --> 00:04:36.570
 improved a lot and where I was a lot 

00:04:33.450 --> 00:04:39.180
 beautiful it is strong and I have decided nothing 

00:04:36.570 --> 00:04:42.390
 to try the trainer plan, nothing for me 

00:04:39.180 --> 00:04:44.700
 they accepted perfect ok which ones 

00:04:42.390 --> 00:04:46.890
 Finished interviews are not the least 

00:04:44.700 --> 00:04:49.380
 how long I still think around 

00:04:46.890 --> 00:04:51.030
 about 4 minutes like last year 

00:04:49.380 --> 00:04:53.190
 I hope you don't mind videos 

00:04:51.030 --> 00:04:54.810
 short seeds here we say at least 

00:04:53.190 --> 00:04:57.090
 also involve a few more people 

00:04:54.810 --> 00:04:58.650
 I think I thank a lot of silver 

00:04:57.090 --> 00:05:00.450
 for being with comments 

00:04:58.650 --> 00:05:04.380
 thank everybody and older 

00:05:00.450 --> 00:05:06.960
 really thanks to all of you guard ok 

00:05:04.380 --> 00:05:08.850
 nothing I would say to greet you I have 

00:05:06.960 --> 00:05:10.970
 finished he left all bye to all 

00:05:08.850 --> 00:05:10.970
 lakes
