that again so I cleared the area because
it<00:00:21.080> to<00:00:22.080> me<00:00:22.260> it<00:00:22.470> takes<00:00:22.740> like<00:00:23.310> some<00:00:24.000> time<00:00:24.300> to<00:00:24.769> do

00:00:25.759 --> 00:00:25.769 
it to me it takes like some time to do

00:00:25.769 --> 00:00:29.990 
it to me it takes like some time to do
Kyoto's<00:00:26.340> Lions<00:00:26.939> so<00:00:27.240> I<00:00:27.510> found<00:00:28.410> the<00:00:28.560> path<00:00:28.830> I<00:00:29.160> this

00:00:29.990 --> 00:00:30.000 
Kyoto's Lions so I found the path I this

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:34.100 
Kyoto's Lions so I found the path I this
is<00:00:30.240> a<00:00:30.269> new<00:00:30.539> pad<00:00:30.779> for<00:00:31.080> me<00:00:31.260> so<00:00:31.560> if<00:00:32.309> I<00:00:32.910> find<00:00:33.300> a<00:00:33.690> lot

00:00:34.100 --> 00:00:34.110 
is a new pad for me so if I find a lot

00:00:34.110 --> 00:00:40.610 
is a new pad for me so if I find a lot
of<00:00:34.170> lions<00:00:34.950> then<00:00:35.340> I<00:00:35.790> guess<00:00:38.420> well<00:00:39.420> sir<00:00:40.110> there<00:00:40.590> are

00:00:40.610 --> 00:00:40.620

of lions then I guess well sir there are
like<00:00:41.129> lions<00:00:41.700> but<00:00:42.030> it<00:00:42.870> seems<00:00:43.260> like<00:00:43.410> a<00:00:43.620> boss

00:00:44.090 --> 00:00:44.100
