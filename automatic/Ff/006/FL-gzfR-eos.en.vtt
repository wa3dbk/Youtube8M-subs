00:02:43.680 --> 00:02:43.690 
and as the foundation also so like if I

00:02:43.690 --> 00:02:47.490

need<00:02:43.930> service<00:02:44.769> pots<00:02:45.010> to<00:02:45.400> be<00:02:45.430> retouched<00:02:46.360> up<00:02:46.690> so

00:02:47.490 --> 00:02:47.500 
need service pots to be retouched up so

00:02:47.500 --> 00:02:51.110

now<00:03:37.180> this<00:03:38.049> one<00:03:38.380> is<00:03:38.739> good<00:03:39.459> because<00:03:39.940> I<00:03:40.060> can<00:03:40.269> build

00:03:40.470 --> 00:03:40.480 
now this one is good because I can build

00:03:40.480 --> 00:03:44.520 
now this one is good because I can build
it<00:03:40.720> and<00:03:41.079> build<00:03:41.709> the<00:03:41.889> color<00:03:42.340> and<00:03:42.849> it<00:03:43.690> matches<00:03:44.109> my

00:03:44.520 --> 00:03:44.530 
it and build the color and it matches my

00:03:44.530 --> 00:03:50.909 
it and build the color and it matches my
skin<00:03:44.919> is<00:03:45.760> the<00:03:46.510> color<00:03:46.540> is<00:03:47.459> perfect<00:03:48.459> I<00:03:49.769> had<00:03:50.769> to

00:03:50.909 --> 00:03:50.919 
skin is the color is perfect I had to

00:03:50.919 --> 00:03:53.159 
skin is the color is perfect I had to
try<00:03:51.160> a<00:03:51.459> couple<00:03:51.819> of<00:03:52.060> colors<00:03:52.329> before<00:03:52.900> I<00:03:52.930> found

00:03:53.159 --> 00:03:53.169 
try a couple of colors before I found

00:03:53.169 --> 00:03:56.400 
try a couple of colors before I found
the<00:03:53.349> right<00:03:53.590> color<00:03:53.769> dog<00:03:54.040> because<00:03:54.959> my<00:03:55.959> skin<00:03:56.260> is

00:03:56.400 --> 00:03:56.410 
the right color dog because my skin is

00:03:56.410 --> 00:03:59.729 
the right color dog because my skin is
so<00:03:56.620> uneven<00:03:56.889> it's<00:03:57.700> in<00:03:58.209> between<00:03:58.840> colors<00:03:59.380> so<00:03:59.709> I

00:03:59.729 --> 00:03:59.739 
so uneven it's in between colors so I

00:03:59.739 --> 00:04:01.470 
so uneven it's in between colors so I
have<00:04:00.069> to<00:04:00.190> find<00:04:00.400> something<00:04:00.790> that<00:04:00.970> will<00:04:01.269> work

00:04:01.470 --> 00:04:01.480 
have to find something that will work

00:04:01.480 --> 00:04:06.390 
have to find something that will work
for<00:04:01.540> every<00:04:02.109> shade<00:04:02.410> in<00:04:02.739> my<00:04:02.950> my<00:04:03.549> skin<00:04:05.190> if<00:04:06.190> that

00:04:06.390 --> 00:04:06.400 
for every shade in my my skin if that

00:04:06.400 --> 00:04:10.520 
for every shade in my my skin if that
makes<00:04:06.579> sense

00:04:10.520 --> 00:04:10.530 

00:04:10.530 --> 00:04:13.289 

so<00:04:11.530> anyway<00:04:12.040> if<00:04:12.280> I<00:04:12.400> went<00:04:12.579> a<00:04:12.609> little<00:04:12.639> more<00:04:13.000> full

00:04:13.289 --> 00:04:13.299 
so anyway if I went a little more full

00:04:13.299 --> 00:04:33.140 
so anyway if I went a little more full
of<00:04:13.419> coverage<00:04:13.750> I<00:04:13.930> might<00:04:14.049> add<00:04:14.169> a<00:04:14.200> little<00:04:14.349> bit

00:04:33.140 --> 00:04:33.150 

00:04:33.150 --> 00:04:36.629 

now<00:04:34.150> when<00:04:34.599> I<00:04:34.629> use<00:04:34.900> this<00:04:35.199> as<00:04:35.470> a<00:04:35.500> um<00:04:36.009> like<00:04:36.610> a

00:04:36.629 --> 00:04:36.639 
now when I use this as a um like a

00:04:36.639 --> 00:04:38.640 
now when I use this as a um like a
concealer<00:04:37.240> to<00:04:37.360> conceal<00:04:37.479> the<00:04:37.870> fire<00:04:38.080> I<00:04:38.259> used<00:04:38.500> a

00:04:38.640 --> 00:04:38.650 
concealer to conceal the fire I used a

00:04:38.650 --> 00:04:41.520 
concealer to conceal the fire I used a
concealer<00:04:38.860> brush<00:04:39.460> and<00:04:40.199> you're<00:04:41.199> supposed<00:04:41.439> to

also do the same thing swirly there and

00:04:45.129 --> 00:04:49.230 
also do the same thing swirly there and
then<00:04:45.370> you'll<00:04:45.639> be<00:04:45.849> able<00:04:46.090> to<00:04:47.370> cover<00:04:48.370> the<00:04:48.610> spots

00:04:49.230 --> 00:04:49.240 
then you'll be able to cover the spots

00:04:49.240 --> 00:04:56.459
