00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.440
 hello you love today i want this 

00:00:02.639 --> 00:00:06.210
 Take a closer look at the product 

00:00:04.440 --> 00:00:07.830
 Of course, if we buy that 

00:00:06.210 --> 00:00:10.250
 should or does not so much fun 

00:00:07.830 --> 00:00:10.250
 there 

00:00:14.910 --> 00:00:20.010
 that manufacturer promise the 

00:00:18.029 --> 00:00:23.400
 manufacturer promises a lot and that 

00:00:20.010 --> 00:00:26.250
 once the serum should be a skin 

00:00:23.400 --> 00:00:28.070
 regenerate and just at the 

00:00:26.250 --> 00:00:29.939
 restore a healthy 

00:00:28.070 --> 00:00:31.050
 look like adolescent charisma 

00:00:29.939 --> 00:00:33.239
 help 

00:00:31.050 --> 00:00:35.340
 he should be the serum that should 

00:00:33.239 --> 00:00:36.510
 Appearance of dark spots after and 

00:00:35.340 --> 00:00:39.540
 to reduce 

00:00:36.510 --> 00:00:42.180
 then it should be at all and dead 

00:00:39.540 --> 00:00:45.420
 removed skin cells and also the 

00:00:42.180 --> 00:00:47.550
 Smooth skin and plus this serum should 

00:00:45.420 --> 00:00:50.720
 of course also donate moisture 

00:00:47.550 --> 00:00:52.940
 the ingredients 

00:00:50.720 --> 00:00:55.310
 the composition I blind you here 

00:00:52.940 --> 00:00:58.640
 one and as you can see is the first ingredient 

00:00:55.310 --> 00:01:01.670
 water which really is not very new 

00:00:58.640 --> 00:01:04.910
 but water is important here because we 

00:01:01.670 --> 00:01:08.270
 see the second ingredient and there are me 

00:01:04.910 --> 00:01:09.260
 ten dogs trainers and choose 

00:01:08.270 --> 00:01:11.210
 perhaps a bit after having 

00:01:09.260 --> 00:01:12.230
 Skincare will deal with this word 

00:01:11.210 --> 00:01:15.350
 be known 

00:01:12.230 --> 00:01:18.380
 under the german name nicotine poverty 

00:01:15.350 --> 00:01:21.590
 and that is a vitamin b3 private and 

00:01:18.380 --> 00:01:23.930
 Vitamin B is water soluble because of that 

00:01:21.590 --> 00:01:26.119
 The first ingredient water with it easy 

00:01:23.930 --> 00:01:28.760
 this fabric can work well and me 

00:01:26.119 --> 00:01:30.650
 have to say here it is actually in 

00:01:28.760 --> 00:01:33.380
 a high concentration because 

00:01:30.650 --> 00:01:37.610
 he second in the list 

00:01:33.380 --> 00:01:40.420
 And vitamin B3 is the anti aging 

00:01:37.610 --> 00:01:43.940
 Actives par excellence 

00:01:40.420 --> 00:01:45.979
 anti-inflammatory that prevents the 

00:01:43.940 --> 00:01:48.220
 Transrapid normal water loss 

00:01:45.979 --> 00:01:51.860
 skin that means the skin stays longer 

00:01:48.220 --> 00:01:54.350
 then moisturizes it preventively 

00:01:51.860 --> 00:01:58.970
 Demand spots so is actually 

00:01:54.350 --> 00:02:01.190
 This fabric is the one with the best anti aging 

00:01:58.970 --> 00:02:03.010
 Apart from 

00:02:01.190 --> 00:02:05.630
 sunscreen of course, too much 

00:02:03.010 --> 00:02:08.179
 this does not help our skin 

00:02:05.630 --> 00:02:11.570
 but it does age quickly in here 

00:02:08.179 --> 00:02:14.840
 a high concentration exists what 

00:02:11.570 --> 00:02:18.440
 Definitely beneficial is what you too 

00:02:14.840 --> 00:02:21.019
 found in this product are relative 

00:02:18.440 --> 00:02:23.600
 many silicones and I like that now 

00:02:21.019 --> 00:02:25.730
 but not so bad that something 

00:02:23.600 --> 00:02:27.709
 to say hypocritical finds silicones 

00:02:25.730 --> 00:02:31.959
 very bad because I have foundation with 

00:02:27.709 --> 00:02:34.489
 Use silicone oil which should be easy 

00:02:31.959 --> 00:02:36.860
 Sensory help the skin 

00:02:34.489 --> 00:02:40.250
 feels better that she smoothed out 

00:02:36.860 --> 00:02:41.690
 looks the even looks and 

00:02:40.250 --> 00:02:44.630
 that's what makes them easy 

00:02:41.690 --> 00:02:46.280
 little bit more beautiful they are 

00:02:44.630 --> 00:02:47.840
 not somehow the body's own 

00:02:46.280 --> 00:02:50.299
 substances that are not included 

00:02:47.840 --> 00:02:52.820
 but are just on the skin 

00:02:50.299 --> 00:02:58.489
 and that sees the skin in a lot 

00:02:52.820 --> 00:03:01.010
 better from that one can say that 

00:02:58.489 --> 00:03:03.200
 they had some corrective things around 

00:03:01.010 --> 00:03:03.500
 effect if you wear it on because just 

00:03:03.200 --> 00:03:06.920
 these 

00:03:03.500 --> 00:03:09.910
 Unfortunately, silicone oils are needed 

00:03:06.920 --> 00:03:12.680
 I say you can find a few 

00:03:09.910 --> 00:03:14.120
 fragrances in this very around the me 

00:03:12.680 --> 00:03:17.060
 not so great to feel so have the 

00:03:14.120 --> 00:03:19.790
 relatively high allergy potential and there 

00:03:17.060 --> 00:03:22.880
 I would say that is the only one 

00:03:19.790 --> 00:03:24.800
 Greed in this product that 

00:03:22.880 --> 00:03:26.810
 just these fragrances were used 

00:03:24.800 --> 00:03:30.470
 and as I said unfortunately a few 

00:03:26.810 --> 00:03:32.180
 not so great but not so 

00:03:30.470 --> 00:03:34.370
 it pays in its skin care since 

00:03:32.180 --> 00:03:36.170
 will certainly have no problem with it 

00:03:34.370 --> 00:03:38.090
 I also find the fragrance then I see 

00:03:36.170 --> 00:03:40.580
 Too strong I actually should 

00:03:38.090 --> 00:03:41.120
 I am rather left out to be honest 

00:03:40.580 --> 00:03:43.010
 should 

00:03:41.120 --> 00:03:47.360
 then you will also find vitamin e 

00:03:43.010 --> 00:03:51.440
 rheinmünster in it then a vitamin c 

00:03:47.360 --> 00:03:53.120
 derivative but this is not so on 

00:03:51.440 --> 00:03:55.100
 there are too few studies 

00:03:53.120 --> 00:03:58.790
 to that vitamin c derivative that is 

00:03:55.100 --> 00:04:00.890
 somehow strong antioxidant 

00:03:58.790 --> 00:04:03.590
 should have skills there are still 

00:04:00.890 --> 00:04:05.840
 other versions of it but so the 

00:04:03.590 --> 00:04:07.760
 I have to say there is not enough 

00:04:05.840 --> 00:04:10.519
 Studies that can prove that 

00:04:07.760 --> 00:04:13.160
 nonetheless vitamin e pure 

00:04:10.519 --> 00:04:14.530
 vitamin e so carol is available that 

00:04:13.160 --> 00:04:16.750
 I think that's very nice, too 

00:04:14.530 --> 00:04:19.729
 otherwise not the composition 

00:04:16.750 --> 00:04:23.830
 actually quite good apart from 

00:04:19.729 --> 00:04:26.470
 the fragrances of the price 

00:04:23.830 --> 00:04:28.900
 for this vial for this 

00:04:26.470 --> 00:04:31.210
 really small bottles there are 40 

00:04:28.900 --> 00:04:34.150
 milliliters in it you pay all in 19 

00:04:31.210 --> 00:04:37.930
 euro 95 because of course not 

00:04:34.150 --> 00:04:40.930
 is cheap but considering that 

00:04:37.930 --> 00:04:44.590
 her vitamin b3 in a very high 

00:04:40.930 --> 00:04:48.580
 concentration would exist then 

00:04:44.590 --> 00:04:50.409
 I say it is relatively justified 

00:04:48.580 --> 00:04:53.560
 if you compare it with other products 

00:04:50.409 --> 00:04:55.840
 I think that compares 

00:04:53.560 --> 00:04:56.770
 actually not that bad with the almost 

00:04:55.840 --> 00:04:59.889
 20 Euros 

00:04:56.770 --> 00:05:02.349
 because I'm much more expensive from others 

00:04:59.889 --> 00:05:04.870
 products know that they are actually from 

00:05:02.349 --> 00:05:09.370
 to almost nothing content materials ago 

00:05:04.870 --> 00:05:09.969
 but bring five and 20 or 22 euros 

00:05:09.370 --> 00:05:12.849
 costs 

00:05:09.969 --> 00:05:17.710
 so I would say that's for 

00:05:12.849 --> 00:05:20.949
 drogerie conditions okay because 

00:05:17.710 --> 00:05:25.280
 actually something was processed here 

00:05:20.949 --> 00:05:27.560
 which also works conclusion 

00:05:25.280 --> 00:05:30.530
 I have this product almost two now 

00:05:27.560 --> 00:05:32.720
 weeks tested and I can too 

00:05:30.530 --> 00:05:33.650
 let's show it's just that 

00:05:32.720 --> 00:05:37.160
 small chain 

00:05:33.650 --> 00:05:40.280
 and then something like that comes relatively 

00:05:37.160 --> 00:05:43.460
 viscous out and I have to say 

00:05:40.280 --> 00:05:46.130
 that after the first application the skin 

00:05:43.460 --> 00:05:47.750
 actually flatter looks even 

00:05:46.130 --> 00:05:49.970
 Of course it looks like that 

00:05:47.750 --> 00:05:54.650
 silicone oils processed in it 

00:05:49.970 --> 00:05:56.780
 and what does that say two to four drips 

00:05:54.650 --> 00:06:00.340
 enough and I usually take it over 

00:05:56.780 --> 00:06:02.720
 the 3 and yes I have to say that the 

00:06:00.340 --> 00:06:04.490
 skin looks more beautiful 

00:06:02.720 --> 00:06:06.919
 clearly you can probably only after 

00:06:04.490 --> 00:06:09.980
 say four weeks yes that really has 

00:06:06.919 --> 00:06:11.540
 brought something but after two weeks 

00:06:09.980 --> 00:06:14.900
 I have to say I like that very well 

00:06:11.540 --> 00:06:16.940
 I have no skin blemishes 

00:06:14.900 --> 00:06:19.100
 get it or otherwise because they like me 

00:06:16.940 --> 00:06:21.200
 the fragrant just bothers is is easy 

00:06:19.100 --> 00:06:23.450
 far too strong in my opinion and 

00:06:21.200 --> 00:06:25.340
 That's not what I like about it 

00:06:23.450 --> 00:06:27.169
 that's probably a criterion why me 

00:06:25.340 --> 00:06:30.950
 namely would buy again 

00:06:27.169 --> 00:06:36.080
 but who likes that is certainly 

00:06:30.950 --> 00:06:38.510
 Well served and there can actually that 

00:06:36.080 --> 00:06:41.240
 also give away wonderful because there 

00:06:38.510 --> 00:06:42.979
 really effective substances are in there 

00:06:41.240 --> 00:06:45.340
 contrast to other products in 

00:06:42.979 --> 00:06:47.660
 the same price of the drugstore 

00:06:45.340 --> 00:06:50.960
 general the vacation products I like 

00:06:47.660 --> 00:06:53.330
 also quite gladly because of the ingredients 

00:06:50.960 --> 00:06:55.880
 So because of many antioxidants and the 

00:06:53.330 --> 00:06:58.460
 vitamin b3 and all the other stuff 

00:06:55.880 --> 00:06:59.750
 they use everything else is there 

00:06:58.460 --> 00:07:01.250
 always a bit difficult because of that 

00:06:59.750 --> 00:07:04.669
 I would definitely do that for you 

00:07:01.250 --> 00:07:07.190
 recommend if he is looking for something 

00:07:04.669 --> 00:07:08.990
 works and where it also studies too 

00:07:07.190 --> 00:07:11.930
 the ingredients are also 

00:07:08.990 --> 00:07:14.150
 work and that's not what 

00:07:11.930 --> 00:07:16.310
 It is thought up where it hardly stands 

00:07:14.150 --> 00:07:18.350
 scientific results 

00:07:16.310 --> 00:07:20.210
 That's why I can recommend that to you 

00:07:18.350 --> 00:07:24.200
 if you do not have a problem with fragrances 

00:07:20.210 --> 00:07:26.990
 or others have clear the silicone oils 

00:07:24.200 --> 00:07:30.110
 they do not look great for the guys right now 

00:07:26.990 --> 00:07:32.270
 environment but i have to say i give up 

00:07:30.110 --> 00:07:33.740
 shampoo on it and all those others 

00:07:32.270 --> 00:07:34.520
 things that really into water conservation 

00:07:33.740 --> 00:07:38.810
 is rinsed 

00:07:34.520 --> 00:07:41.510
 from that I find that justifiable and 

00:07:38.810 --> 00:07:43.130
 for this year to be ok now would me 

00:07:41.510 --> 00:07:46.790
 Of course, if I like the art 

00:07:43.130 --> 00:07:49.730
 and way of the videos has fallen so much 

00:07:46.790 --> 00:07:51.200
 if you have any feedback then 

00:07:49.730 --> 00:07:52.010
 I like to write down in the 

00:07:51.200 --> 00:07:54.560
 comments to 

00:07:52.010 --> 00:07:57.010
 otherwise you Schöntag until 

00:07:54.560 --> 00:07:57.010
 next time
