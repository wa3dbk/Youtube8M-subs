00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.130
 hello today i will tell you 

00:00:02.310 --> 00:00:07.589
 complete instructions for working with the game 

00:00:05.130 --> 00:00:10.110
 bombs counter strike for the game and streetball 

00:00:07.589 --> 00:00:12.660
 floor quest but also other 

00:00:10.110 --> 00:00:19.039
 product made a lot chest anthrazhno 

00:00:12.660 --> 00:00:23.699
 aluminum body potato consists 

00:00:19.039 --> 00:00:26.039
 key to start the speaker with a very 

00:00:23.699 --> 00:00:28.529
 loud sound or plug under here 

00:00:26.039 --> 00:00:31.529
 such led strip 

00:00:28.529 --> 00:00:32.960
 this is an imitation of the explosion means upper 

00:00:31.529 --> 00:00:35.100
 indicator shows 

00:00:32.960 --> 00:00:37.620
 countdown bottom indicator 

00:00:35.100 --> 00:00:41.070
 input code respectively keyboard 

00:00:37.620 --> 00:00:44.690
 to enter this very code or bomb 

00:00:41.070 --> 00:00:47.370
 disabled or activated 

00:00:44.690 --> 00:00:52.680
 pulling out 1 out of 8 

00:00:47.370 --> 00:00:54.420
 wiring means to run but given 

00:00:52.680 --> 00:00:56.789
 the case is worth 30 minutes proper as 

00:00:54.420 --> 00:01:02.129
 reprogram this bomb we introduce 

00:00:56.789 --> 00:01:05.369
 master code 1357 all vadim here 

00:01:02.129 --> 00:01:09.240
 confirmed we diets click eat 

00:01:05.369 --> 00:01:12.420
 the cat and no but now we will time which 

00:01:09.240 --> 00:01:16.229
 we must be ticking then let it be 

00:01:12.420 --> 00:01:18.479
 For example, 40 minutes next, enter 

00:01:16.229 --> 00:01:21.119
 password to guess 

00:01:18.479 --> 00:01:23.460
 let's allow some sort of cache 

00:01:21.119 --> 00:01:29.420
 he was either taken hostage by anyone 

00:01:23.460 --> 00:01:32.689
 asking and so on we enter 1234 

00:01:29.420 --> 00:01:34.409
 confirming the following indicate the value 

00:01:32.689 --> 00:01:36.840
 wires for example 

00:01:34.409 --> 00:01:39.299
 starting from the bottom up let's say red 

00:01:36.840 --> 00:01:42.540
 the wire will be the right wire 

00:01:39.299 --> 00:01:45.570
 one the next three wires will be 

00:01:42.540 --> 00:01:47.970
 neutral what is neutral 

00:01:45.570 --> 00:01:49.560
 wires mean when u pull out 

00:01:47.970 --> 00:01:51.119
 neutral wire or dial 

00:01:49.560 --> 00:01:55.579
 wrong code on the keyboard 

00:01:51.119 --> 00:01:59.460
 you start time as two times faster 

00:01:55.579 --> 00:02:01.649
 further the next debt wire let it be 

00:01:59.460 --> 00:02:03.600
 wrong at which mob will work 

00:02:01.649 --> 00:02:04.829
 Immediately the rest will remain 

00:02:03.600 --> 00:02:07.920
 neutral 

00:02:04.829 --> 00:02:09.780
 We confirm on the indicators given written 

00:02:07.920 --> 00:02:12.660
 need to restart dev 

00:02:09.780 --> 00:02:15.840
 that during the game you are his now 

00:02:12.660 --> 00:02:18.480
 start removing their key here is gone 

00:02:15.840 --> 00:02:22.220
 40 minutes countdown and the task of his people 

00:02:18.480 --> 00:02:28.980
 demining show you here 

00:02:22.220 --> 00:02:31.470
 wrong password from start time 

00:02:28.980 --> 00:02:33.739
 faster ticking twice will be another 

00:02:31.470 --> 00:02:39.410
 wrong password will start ticking 

00:02:33.739 --> 00:02:39.410
 still in logic is the correct password 

00:02:40.550 --> 00:02:49.070
 the bomb writes access stops its 

00:02:44.489 --> 00:02:52.050
 action on time 39 minutes 14 seconds 

00:02:49.070 --> 00:02:57.390
 all bomb cleared restarted 

00:02:52.050 --> 00:02:58.950
 wiring device work 

00:02:57.390 --> 00:03:01.760
 similarly that is, let's say a person 

00:02:58.950 --> 00:03:01.760
 tries at random 

00:03:02.060 --> 00:03:06.959
 pulled neutral wire start time 

00:03:05.160 --> 00:03:08.850
 go faster pull another one 

00:03:06.959 --> 00:03:09.890
 neutral wire time night these 

00:03:08.850 --> 00:03:13.829
 faster 

00:03:09.890 --> 00:03:16.579
 pulled the right time wire 

00:03:13.829 --> 00:03:16.579
 stopped 

00:03:19.670 --> 00:03:29.790
 insert the wiring back and now 

00:03:22.440 --> 00:03:32.579
 show you the very imitation of the explosion let's say 

00:03:29.790 --> 00:03:43.380
 we pull neutral wire time 

00:03:32.579 --> 00:03:46.500
 It became faster to pull it burns 

00:03:43.380 --> 00:03:48.989
 LED before the tape goes through let's say 

00:03:46.500 --> 00:03:50.250
 did you forget any two wires 

00:03:48.989 --> 00:03:53.850
 insert into the connector and 

00:03:50.250 --> 00:03:57.930
 and enter reprogramming mode 

00:03:53.850 --> 00:04:03.359
 device cheat code visible let's say time 

00:03:57.930 --> 00:04:06.030
 two hours and one hour it doesn't matter here one two 

00:04:03.359 --> 00:04:08.070
 three four here at this stage before 

00:04:06.030 --> 00:04:10.680
 programming these same wires 

00:04:08.070 --> 00:04:15.090
 You will be shown that the third fourth wire 

00:04:10.680 --> 00:04:17.900
 torn off and that is they need to be inserted 

00:04:15.090 --> 00:04:17.900
 still in place 

00:04:19.040 --> 00:04:23.790
 restart the device and 

00:04:21.000 --> 00:04:26.880
 program them again well and the most 

00:04:23.790 --> 00:04:28.410
 finishing touch means bomb magnifier he's in 

00:04:26.880 --> 00:04:30.930
 Entourage us Casey looks like 

00:04:28.410 --> 00:04:33.240
 as you are used to 

00:04:30.930 --> 00:04:36.240
 see bombs in all sorts of art 

00:04:33.240 --> 00:04:38.100
 movies so not worth such a bomb 

00:04:36.240 --> 00:04:40.860
 ticking include public areas 

00:04:38.100 --> 00:04:41.460
 with outsiders who do not play 

00:04:40.860 --> 00:04:44.430
 with you 

00:04:41.460 --> 00:04:46.170
 laser ie airsoft pinball well and so 

00:04:44.430 --> 00:04:48.090
 further so as not to cause 

00:04:46.170 --> 00:04:49.560
 unnecessary association with him is more to 

00:04:48.090 --> 00:04:52.830
 they didn't call the police squad 

00:04:49.560 --> 00:04:55.880
 demining real thanks to all 

00:04:52.830 --> 00:04:55.880
 good luck to you
