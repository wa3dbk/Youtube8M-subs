legal<00:02:57.389> acts<00:02:57.840> and<00:02:58.230> you<00:02:58.519> then<00:02:59.519> you<00:02:59.639> just<00:02:59.669> want<00:03:00.090> to

00:03:00.229 --> 00:03:00.239 
legal acts and you then you just want to

00:03:00.239 --> 00:03:04.090 
legal acts and you then you just want to
harass<00:03:00.419> them

00:03:04.090 --> 00:03:04.100 

00:03:04.100 --> 00:03:07.990

00:03:07.990 --> 00:03:08.000 
but you don't understand that you think

00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:12.160 
but you don't understand that you think
just<00:03:08.450> because<00:03:08.600> you<00:03:08.900> have<00:03:09.080> a<00:03:09.110> badge<00:03:11.170> you're
