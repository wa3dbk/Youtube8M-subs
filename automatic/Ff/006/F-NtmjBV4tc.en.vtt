00:02:29.550 --> 00:02:29.560 
all the way around this trap and just

00:02:29.560 --> 00:02:31.199 
all the way around this trap and just
picked<00:02:29.739> it<00:02:29.890> right<00:02:29.920> up<00:02:30.069> and<00:02:30.400> said<00:02:30.610> it<00:02:30.760> over<00:02:30.880> here

as you can see that one clump of grass
it<00:03:34.030> just<00:03:34.269> it<00:03:34.630> stands<00:03:35.019> out<00:03:35.380> so<00:03:36.420> I<00:03:37.420> decided<00:03:37.659> to

00:03:38.130 --> 00:03:38.140 
it just it stands out so I decided to

00:03:38.140 --> 00:03:40.140 
it just it stands out so I decided to
set<00:03:38.379> it<00:03:38.530> I<00:03:38.560> was<00:03:38.799> going<00:03:39.010> to<00:03:39.069> set<00:03:39.220> the<00:03:39.400> the<00:03:39.670> piece

00:03:40.140 --> 00:03:40.150 
set it I was going to set the the piece

00:03:40.150 --> 00:03:42.120 
set it I was going to set the the piece
of<00:03:40.269> PVC<00:03:40.420> but<00:03:40.959> the<00:03:41.079> ground<00:03:41.319> was<00:03:41.470> too<00:03:41.620> loose

00:03:42.120 --> 00:03:42.130 
of PVC but the ground was too loose

00:03:42.130 --> 00:03:44.820 
of PVC but the ground was too loose
I<00:03:42.190> just<00:03:43.060> chose<00:03:43.270> the<00:03:43.450> knick<00:03:43.630> specs<00:03:43.960> next<00:03:44.590> best

00:03:44.820 --> 00:03:44.830 
I just chose the knick specs next best

00:03:44.830 --> 00:03:49.380 
I just chose the knick specs next best
spot<00:03:46.140> and<00:03:47.140> I<00:03:47.530> didn't<00:03:48.340> quite<00:03:48.460> bed<00:03:48.730> my<00:03:48.880> trap<00:03:49.120> good

00:03:49.380 --> 00:03:49.390 
spot and I didn't quite bed my trap good

00:03:49.390 --> 00:03:57.510 
spot and I didn't quite bed my trap good
enough<00:03:51.000> so<00:03:52.000> anyway<00:03:55.110> you<00:03:56.110> guys<00:03:56.320> can<00:03:56.620> put<00:03:57.340> that

00:03:57.510 --> 00:03:57.520 
enough so anyway you guys can put that

00:03:57.520 --> 00:04:00.090 
enough so anyway you guys can put that
in<00:03:57.700> your<00:03:57.750> arsenal<00:03:58.750> of<00:03:58.930> co2<00:03:59.470> trapping<00:04:00.010> the

00:04:00.090 --> 00:04:00.100 
in your arsenal of co2 trapping the

00:04:00.100 --> 00:04:03.030 
in your arsenal of co2 trapping the
information<00:04:00.610> I<00:04:00.730> guess<00:04:01.260> because<00:04:02.260> bedding<00:04:02.920> your

00:04:03.030 --> 00:04:03.040 
information I guess because bedding your

00:04:03.040 --> 00:04:06.270 
information I guess because bedding your
trap<00:04:03.310> is<00:04:03.960> number<00:04:04.960> one<00:04:05.200> after<00:04:05.620> you<00:04:05.770> find<00:04:06.070> your

00:04:06.270 --> 00:04:06.280 
trap is number one after you find your

00:04:06.280 --> 00:04:09.830 
trap is number one after you find your
location<00:04:07.110> if<00:04:08.110> you<00:04:08.290> don't<00:04:08.470> bed<00:04:08.650> that<00:04:08.860> trap

00:04:09.830 --> 00:04:09.840 
location if you don't bed that trap

00:04:09.840 --> 00:04:15.360 
location if you don't bed that trap
correctly<00:04:10.840> and<00:04:11.470> firmly<00:04:13.980> you're<00:04:14.980> gonna<00:04:15.190> have

00:04:15.360 --> 00:04:15.370 
correctly and firmly you're gonna have

00:04:15.370 --> 00:04:19.430 
correctly and firmly you're gonna have
what<00:04:15.580> I<00:04:15.610> have<00:04:15.910> right<00:04:16.180> here<00:04:16.209> this<00:04:17.110> morning

00:04:24.930 --> 00:04:24.940 
shot of it anyway that's poly fill up

00:04:24.940 --> 00:04:32.120 
shot of it anyway that's poly fill up
under<00:04:25.270> up<00:04:25.990> under<00:04:26.260> my<00:04:26.410> pan<00:04:26.650> I<00:04:29.220> wish<00:04:30.220> I<00:04:30.340> could<00:04:30.520> I
