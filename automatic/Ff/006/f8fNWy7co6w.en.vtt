fingers<00:01:25.920> are<00:01:25.979> all<00:01:26.100> pointing<00:01:26.430> up<00:01:26.580> so<00:01:27.450> they're

00:01:27.560 --> 00:01:27.570 
fingers are all pointing up so they're

00:01:27.570 --> 00:01:30.830 
fingers are all pointing up so they're
out<00:01:27.659> of<00:01:27.689> your<00:01:27.810> way<00:01:27.990> then<00:01:28.950> you<00:01:29.159> have<00:01:29.189> the<00:01:29.840> screw

goes<00:01:31.110> onto<00:01:31.320> the<00:01:31.530> left<00:01:31.890> side<00:01:32.869> and<00:01:33.869> then

00:01:34.039 --> 00:01:34.049 
goes onto the left side and then

00:01:34.049 --> 00:01:36.350 
goes onto the left side and then
whichever<00:01:34.470> fret<00:01:34.740> you<00:01:34.829> want<00:01:34.979> to<00:01:35.070> fret<00:01:35.220> app<00:01:35.430> just

00:01:36.350 --> 00:01:36.360 
whichever fret you want to fret app just

00:01:36.360 --> 00:01:40.190 
whichever fret you want to fret app just
place<00:01:36.630> it<00:01:36.840> slightly<00:01:37.140> in<00:01:37.320> front<00:01:37.590> and<00:01:39.200> there's

00:01:40.190 --> 00:01:40.200 
place it slightly in front and there's

00:01:40.200 --> 00:01:41.600 
place it slightly in front and there's
two<00:01:40.350> little<00:01:40.500> lips<00:01:40.860> you<00:01:41.100> won't<00:01:41.250> be<00:01:41.310> able<00:01:41.369> to<00:01:41.460> see

00:01:41.600 --> 00:01:41.610 
two little lips you won't be able to see

00:01:41.610 --> 00:01:43.069 
two little lips you won't be able to see
but<00:01:41.790> there's<00:01:42.240> two<00:01:42.329> little<00:01:42.570> ledges<00:01:42.869> that

00:01:43.069 --> 00:01:43.079 
but there's two little ledges that

00:01:43.079 --> 00:01:45.139 
but there's two little ledges that
basically<00:01:43.890> sit<00:01:44.159> on<00:01:44.369> top<00:01:44.610> of<00:01:44.670> the<00:01:44.939> fret<00:01:45.090> board

00:01:45.139 --> 00:01:45.149 
basically sit on top of the fret board

00:01:45.149 --> 00:01:50.980 
basically sit on top of the fret board
so<00:01:45.990> you<00:01:46.079> push<00:01:46.380> the<00:01:47.390> push<00:01:48.390> the<00:01:48.540> sides<00:01:48.780> in<00:01:49.049> and

00:01:50.980 --> 00:01:50.990 
so you push the push the sides in and

00:01:50.990 --> 00:01:57.779 
so you push the push the sides in and
tighten

00:01:57.779 --> 00:01:57.789 

00:01:57.789 --> 00:02:00.959 

it's<00:01:58.780> firmly<00:01:58.990> in<00:01:59.259> place<00:01:59.409> and<00:01:59.799> then<00:02:00.610> you<00:02:00.759> just

00:02:00.959 --> 00:02:00.969 
it's firmly in place and then you just

00:02:00.969 --> 00:02:04.160 
it's firmly in place and then you just
push<00:02:01.570> whichever<00:02:02.189> fingers<00:02:03.189> you<00:02:03.280> want<00:02:03.460> down

00:02:04.160 --> 00:02:04.170 
push whichever fingers you want down

00:02:04.170 --> 00:02:07.620 
push whichever fingers you want down
onto<00:02:05.170> the<00:02:05.259> fret<00:02:05.850> I've<00:02:06.850> already<00:02:07.270> lined<00:02:07.450> these

00:02:07.620 --> 00:02:07.630 
onto the fret I've already lined these

00:02:07.630 --> 00:02:08.910 
onto the fret I've already lined these
up<00:02:07.840> so<00:02:07.960> they're<00:02:08.110> perfectly<00:02:08.440> lined<00:02:08.619> up<00:02:08.769> with

00:02:08.910 --> 00:02:08.920 
up so they're perfectly lined up with

00:02:08.920 --> 00:02:11.640 
up so they're perfectly lined up with
the<00:02:08.979> strings<00:02:09.929> and<00:02:10.929> there<00:02:11.080> we<00:02:11.140> go<00:02:11.319> let's<00:02:11.500> give

00:02:11.640 --> 00:02:11.650 
the strings and there we go let's give

00:02:11.650 --> 00:02:22.740 
the strings and there we go let's give
that<00:02:11.739> a<00:02:11.769> go<00:02:21.060> so<00:02:22.060> I'm<00:02:22.120> going<00:02:22.239> to<00:02:22.300> use<00:02:22.450> one<00:02:22.720> of

00:02:22.740 --> 00:02:22.750 
that a go so I'm going to use one of

00:02:22.750 --> 00:02:25.380 
that a go so I'm going to use one of
their<00:02:22.900> suggested<00:02:23.349> tunings<00:02:23.739> which<00:02:24.010> is<00:02:24.390> they

00:02:25.380 --> 00:02:25.390 
their suggested tunings which is they

00:02:25.390 --> 00:02:27.570 
their suggested tunings which is they
called<00:02:25.630> a<00:02:25.750> get<00:02:26.019> up<00:02:26.260> a<00:02:26.440> full<00:02:26.590> step<00:02:26.830> it's<00:02:27.400> not

00:02:27.570 --> 00:02:27.580 
called a get up a full step it's not

00:02:27.580 --> 00:02:30.140 
called a get up a full step it's not
quite<00:02:27.819> because<00:02:28.000> you<00:02:28.660> can't<00:02:28.870> actually<00:02:29.019> access

00:02:30.140 --> 00:02:30.150 
quite because you can't actually access

00:02:30.150 --> 00:02:33.120 
quite because you can't actually access
the<00:02:31.150> second<00:02:31.810> fret<00:02:32.019> on<00:02:32.200> the<00:02:32.319> open<00:02:32.830> strings

00:02:36.240 --> 00:02:36.250 
which normally would be able to but you

00:02:36.250 --> 00:02:41.039 
which normally would be able to but you
still<00:02:36.489> get<00:02:36.640> that<00:02:36.670> dagger<00:02:37.180> flavor<00:02:38.730> and<00:02:40.049> I'm

little<00:02:47.170> bit<00:02:47.319> more<00:02:47.560> because<00:02:47.799> it's<00:02:47.920> not<00:02:48.069> the

00:02:48.270 --> 00:02:48.280 
little bit more because it's not the

00:02:48.280 --> 00:03:45.510 
little bit more because it's not the
same<00:02:48.819> shapes<00:02:49.180> that<00:02:49.390> you're<00:02:49.510> used
