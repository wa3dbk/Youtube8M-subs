00:00:03.640 --> 00:00:09.340
 then today more birthday and mine 

00:00:07.270 --> 00:00:12.070
 little girl children 

00:00:09.340 --> 00:00:15.760
 if the child my life girl 

00:00:12.070 --> 00:00:19.810
 making a high fit Sardinian file cake 

00:00:15.760 --> 00:00:22.029
 but fernando the thermal with the right one 

00:00:19.810 --> 00:00:24.759
 it's fine that happy street sees us not 

00:00:22.029 --> 00:00:27.429
 there is very good flour now we resume 

00:00:24.759 --> 00:00:29.859
 the recipe so let's see how it is 

00:00:27.429 --> 00:00:32.590
 ago and very good is a Russian cake that 

00:00:29.859 --> 00:00:35.110
 however it can be done laboriously 

00:00:32.590 --> 00:00:56.109
 also with others 

00:00:35.110 --> 00:00:59.140
 at 37 an apologetic lender arrived 

00:00:56.109 --> 00:01:00.940
 and then do it with other dried fruit 

00:00:59.140 --> 00:01:04.470
 I think maybe even with coconut and 

00:01:00.940 --> 00:01:07.600
 certainly also with leo it is very good 

00:01:04.470 --> 00:01:10.630
 then the recipe says beat 6 reds 

00:01:07.600 --> 00:01:13.659
 of egg with 200 grams of sugar 

00:01:10.630 --> 00:01:15.520
 chop 240 grams of almonds and one 

00:01:13.659 --> 00:01:18.369
 lemon peel is fine we did 

00:01:15.520 --> 00:01:20.700
 two but also a hand that can be 

00:01:18.369 --> 00:01:23.649
 already bought xvi squeeze the lemon 

00:01:20.700 --> 00:01:26.770
 add the almond flour to the rind 

00:01:23.649 --> 00:01:28.299
 chopped beaten eggs mount 6 

00:01:26.770 --> 00:01:30.130
 egg whites until stiff 

00:01:28.299 --> 00:01:31.990
 add the lemon juice and the 

00:01:30.130 --> 00:01:36.460
 egg whites to the mixture 

00:01:31.990 --> 00:01:37.220
 Bake in a hot oven and bake at 125 

00:01:36.460 --> 00:01:42.140
 courage 

00:01:37.220 --> 00:01:45.200
 for about 45 minutes let me tell you say 

00:01:42.140 --> 00:01:47.360
 the ingredients are 240 grams of 

00:01:45.200 --> 00:01:49.640
 almonds here we took the almonds 

00:01:47.360 --> 00:01:52.400
 still with their skin because so 

00:01:49.640 --> 00:01:56.810
 we are sure they are not fresh 

00:01:52.400 --> 00:01:59.360
 rancid 6 fresh eggs possibly 200 

00:01:56.810 --> 00:02:03.310
 g of sugar I recommend not to cane 

00:01:59.360 --> 00:02:03.310
 and two organic lemons 

00:02:05.040 --> 00:02:09.030
 the first thing to do is that 

00:02:06.960 --> 00:02:12.330
 to remove the skin because this 

00:02:09.030 --> 00:02:15.390
 beautiful and bitter with a bitter taste 

00:02:12.330 --> 00:02:21.060
 how to do it for stellar people throw themselves and 

00:02:15.390 --> 00:02:24.660
 almonds in boiling water so and yes 

00:02:21.060 --> 00:02:26.370
 leave about 2 or 3 minutes in the 

00:02:24.660 --> 00:02:29.370
 bill and so the skin gets tired 

00:02:26.370 --> 00:02:32.130
 better so later it will be enough 

00:02:29.370 --> 00:02:36.780
 easy to take the almonds 

00:02:32.130 --> 00:02:39.420
 from the boiling water it is simply between 

00:02:36.780 --> 00:02:43.910
 forefinger and thumb doing this operation is 

00:02:39.420 --> 00:02:45.780
 yes they perfectly shell out naturally 

00:02:43.910 --> 00:02:48.150
 a bit long operation even a little 

00:02:45.780 --> 00:02:49.110
 boring but it is very easy for them to go 

00:02:48.150 --> 00:02:51.209
 to burn your fingers 

00:02:49.110 --> 00:02:53.190
 these almonds and then they must be 

00:02:51.209 --> 00:02:56.790
 perfectly dry before being 

00:02:53.190 --> 00:02:58.440
 chop them spread on a cloth on the 

00:02:56.790 --> 00:03:00.239
 dish cloth is left for half an hour 

00:02:58.440 --> 00:03:02.090
 Italian dry alone 

00:03:00.239 --> 00:03:04.080
 only then can they be minced 

00:03:02.090 --> 00:03:06.450
 an alternative would be to buy it flour 

00:03:04.080 --> 00:03:08.970
 of almonds already found and not made 

00:03:06.450 --> 00:03:11.550
 you will save this now firm arms 

00:03:08.970 --> 00:03:13.860
 spread no other ending well 

00:03:11.550 --> 00:03:16.200
 spaced apart so that they dry 

00:03:13.860 --> 00:03:19.459
 and be careful when working with 

00:03:16.200 --> 00:03:22.320
 almonds because they get stained 

00:03:19.459 --> 00:03:26.760
 this water left here by the skins 

00:03:22.320 --> 00:03:29.370
 stain with your hands or read now 

00:03:26.760 --> 00:03:31.130
 Shelled almonds are dry 

00:03:29.370 --> 00:03:36.500
 let's make it come up animate 

00:03:31.130 --> 00:03:41.240
 and put the nourished whole and chop 

00:03:36.500 --> 00:03:45.710
 until they become of the 

00:03:41.240 --> 00:03:47.870
 texture of the flour ready via the 

00:03:45.710 --> 00:03:51.350
 almond flour than almonds 

00:03:47.870 --> 00:03:54.500
 chopped and now we're sharing here 

00:03:51.350 --> 00:03:58.520
 egg whites from the yolks because we need them 

00:03:54.500 --> 00:04:01.060
 only then is it important because yours 

00:03:58.520 --> 00:04:04.100
 they can fit well that there is not 

00:04:01.060 --> 00:04:05.840
 no part of yolk inside 

00:04:04.100 --> 00:04:08.750
 otherwise they will never be able to 

00:04:05.840 --> 00:04:10.910
 also you need to mind a little salt and 

00:04:08.750 --> 00:04:13.010
 put them in the fridge because when there 

00:04:10.910 --> 00:04:13.760
 we mount we must be well cold of 

00:04:13.010 --> 00:04:16.940
 fridge 

00:04:13.760 --> 00:04:18.980
 so these goes in the fridge before 

00:04:16.940 --> 00:04:20.950
 start preparing a cake 

00:04:18.980 --> 00:04:23.230
 in addition to the ingredients 

00:04:20.950 --> 00:04:25.810
 right away on the fair side door so it is 

00:04:23.230 --> 00:04:28.240
 empty for not buttered is an add 

00:04:25.810 --> 00:04:31.540
 more calories are taken one piece 

00:04:28.240 --> 00:04:34.060
 of baking paper sell rolls and then 

00:04:31.540 --> 00:04:37.840
 it can be bent and wet in the child 

00:04:34.060 --> 00:04:41.350
 rocchi like it or not has it 

00:04:37.840 --> 00:04:43.420
 marked for davide and the shape with the top 

00:04:41.350 --> 00:04:44.980
 ten otherwise it remains rigid if it is not 

00:04:43.420 --> 00:04:46.930
 wet with the other one instead so yes 

00:04:44.980 --> 00:04:49.510
 fits well then you can cut the 

00:04:46.930 --> 00:04:51.760
 edges and this is put aside 

00:04:49.510 --> 00:04:54.520
 in the meantime it is calculated at the time enough 

00:04:51.760 --> 00:04:56.200
 go out there the cake is quick you can 

00:04:54.520 --> 00:04:59.410
 immediately heat the oven otherwise a 

00:04:56.200 --> 00:05:02.080
 half of the preparations are spread now 

00:04:59.410 --> 00:05:06.750
 let's beat the six yolk 

00:05:02.080 --> 00:05:06.750
 of egg with 200 grams of sugar 

00:05:09.700 --> 00:05:18.430
 we grated 2 lemons the peel e 

00:05:13.990 --> 00:05:22.960
 now let's go to guard everything and 

00:05:18.430 --> 00:05:24.610
 then we will combine the cream and 

00:05:22.960 --> 00:05:27.880
 natural coloring will no longer be 

00:05:24.610 --> 00:05:30.700
 orange but it will be yellow now we join 

00:05:27.880 --> 00:05:32.950
 the grated lemon rind of the two 

00:05:30.700 --> 00:05:36.970
 lemons that rest on the mixture of 

00:05:32.950 --> 00:05:38.770
 eggs and sugar and little by little too 

00:05:36.970 --> 00:05:41.380
 made of almonds we do little 

00:05:38.770 --> 00:05:43.510
 at a time because otherwise a thousand 

00:05:41.380 --> 00:05:46.080
 whips will not turn out well instead what you do 

00:05:43.510 --> 00:05:49.090
 amalgamates very good text rate 

00:05:46.080 --> 00:05:52.030
 let's start incorporating these first 

00:05:49.090 --> 00:05:55.960
 ingredients and less hand we add 

00:05:52.030 --> 00:05:56.500
 also that arrest always taking care of the 

00:05:55.960 --> 00:05:58.810
 consists 

00:05:56.500 --> 00:06:00.820
 just because these whips I had 

00:05:58.810 --> 00:06:06.100
 moment actually they are right for the 

00:06:00.820 --> 00:06:09.480
 egg whites then abruptly read a little 

00:06:06.100 --> 00:06:09.480
 lemon lemon juice 

00:06:11.530 --> 00:06:15.330
 now we are mounting trees 

00:06:15.390 --> 00:06:19.580
 but 

00:06:16.490 --> 00:06:24.220
 the egg whites will be ready when they have 

00:06:19.580 --> 00:06:26.930
 this is a rather solid consistency 

00:06:24.220 --> 00:06:31.729
 they must never always call to the 

00:06:26.930 --> 00:06:34.520
 composed from the bottom upwards always 

00:06:31.729 --> 00:06:38.419
 so in this sense we must not 

00:06:34.520 --> 00:06:40.849
 mix it up a little at a time we abandon them 

00:06:38.419 --> 00:06:43.039
 all minding that the oven has been added 

00:06:40.849 --> 00:06:46.729
 temperature because you should not lose 

00:06:43.039 --> 00:06:49.819
 tete the mixture did not remain spilled 

00:06:46.729 --> 00:06:52.639
 in the cake tin if it came a little less it was 

00:06:49.819 --> 00:06:54.289
 shock to homogenize level way 

00:06:52.639 --> 00:06:56.990
 that it is not a part other dance cards 

00:06:54.289 --> 00:07:00.759
 and then quickly one must be baked 

00:06:56.990 --> 00:07:00.759
 very very high temperature 

00:07:05.790 --> 00:07:09.440
 then we'll be a classic toothpick test
