just<00:00:30.630> sort<00:00:30.869> of<00:00:30.900> compare<00:00:31.650> it<00:00:31.740> to<00:00:31.980> last<00:00:32.850> year's

00:00:33.170 --> 00:00:33.180

00:00:33.180 --> 00:00:37.549 
just sort of compare it to last year's
model<00:00:33.600> I<00:00:35.600> really<00:00:36.600> feel<00:00:36.780> like<00:00:36.809> the<00:00:37.110> screen<00:00:37.380> was

00:00:37.549 --> 00:00:37.559 
model I really feel like the screen was

00:00:37.559 --> 00:00:41.510 
model I really feel like the screen was
bigger<00:00:37.770> and<00:00:39.350> doesn't<00:00:40.350> look<00:00:40.500> to<00:00:40.649> be<00:00:40.829> but<00:00:41.219> it's

00:00:41.510 --> 00:00:41.520 
bigger and doesn't look to be but it's

00:00:41.520 --> 00:00:45.860 
bigger and doesn't look to be but it's
kind<00:00:41.700> of<00:00:41.760> more<00:00:41.910> centered<00:00:43.399> and<00:00:44.399> also<00:00:44.700> how<00:00:45.059> it

00:00:45.860 --> 00:00:45.870 
kind of more centered and also how it

00:00:45.870 --> 00:00:49.700 
kind of more centered and also how it
also<00:00:46.140> has<00:00:46.260> a<00:00:46.289> built-in<00:00:47.539> headphone<00:00:48.539> jack<00:00:49.050> and<00:00:49.289> i

00:00:49.700 --> 00:00:49.710 
also has a built-in headphone jack and i

00:00:49.710 --> 00:00:54.260 
also has a built-in headphone jack and i
believe<00:00:50.039> that<00:00:50.070> is<00:00:50.550> the<00:00:50.870> proof<00:00:51.870> speaker<00:00:53.270> you

00:00:54.260 --> 00:00:54.270 
believe that is the proof speaker you

00:00:54.270 --> 00:00:56.990 
believe that is the proof speaker you
can<00:00:54.390> also<00:00:54.510> have<00:00:54.870> your<00:00:55.350> power<00:00:55.559> button<00:00:55.680> here<00:00:56.250> so

00:00:56.990 --> 00:00:57.000 
can also have your power button here so

00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:00.770 
can also have your power button here so
you<00:00:57.059> can<00:00:57.329> turn<00:00:57.449> it<00:00:57.570> on<00:00:57.660> and<00:00:57.719> off<00:00:58.399> and<00:00:59.629> this<00:01:00.629> is

00:01:00.770 --> 00:01:00.780 
you can turn it on and off and this is

00:01:00.780 --> 00:01:04.520 
you can turn it on and off and this is
your<00:01:00.960> hero<00:01:01.559> 3<00:01:01.920> sort<00:01:02.280> of<00:01:02.340> expansion<00:01:02.850> so<00:01:03.690> again

00:01:04.520 --> 00:01:04.530 
your hero 3 sort of expansion so again

00:01:07.609 --> 00:01:07.619 
it's pretty much the same size it feels

00:01:07.619 --> 00:01:11.450 
it's pretty much the same size it feels
a<00:01:07.740> tad<00:01:08.040> bit<00:01:08.490> smaller<00:01:10.130> does<00:01:11.130> feel<00:01:11.340> a<00:01:11.400> little

00:01:11.450 --> 00:01:11.460 
a tad bit smaller does feel a little

00:01:11.460 --> 00:01:13.490 
a tad bit smaller does feel a little
heavier<00:01:11.880> actually<00:01:12.270> though<00:01:12.420> than<00:01:12.720> the

00:01:13.490 --> 00:01:13.500 
heavier actually though than the

00:01:13.500 --> 00:01:16.160 
heavier actually though than the
previous<00:01:13.860> model<00:01:13.890> and<00:01:14.340> it's<00:01:14.970> sleek<00:01:15.750> in<00:01:15.930> black

settings we can actually navigate

00:04:07.560 --> 00:04:10.130 
settings we can actually navigate
through<00:04:08.010> the<00:04:08.099> menus<00:04:08.459> much<00:04:08.910> easier<00:04:09.360> than<00:04:09.720> you

00:04:10.130 --> 00:04:10.140 
through the menus much easier than you

00:04:10.140 --> 00:04:13.940 
through the menus much easier than you
can<00:04:10.170> through<00:04:10.590> the<00:04:10.860> front<00:04:11.099> LCD<00:04:11.310> screen<00:04:12.140> I<00:04:13.140> kind

00:04:13.950 --> 00:04:16.159 
can through the front LCD screen I kind
of<00:04:14.069> feel<00:04:14.250> the<00:04:14.579> front<00:04:14.880> of<00:04:14.970> front<00:04:15.630> LCD<00:04:15.780> screen

00:04:16.159 --> 00:04:16.169 
of feel the front of front LCD screen

00:04:16.169 --> 00:04:17.509 
of feel the front of front LCD screen
has<00:04:16.260> gotten<00:04:16.470> a<00:04:16.500> lot<00:04:16.620> more<00:04:16.680> complicated<00:04:17.160> with

00:04:17.509 --> 00:04:17.519 
has gotten a lot more complicated with

00:04:17.519 --> 00:04:18.620 
has gotten a lot more complicated with
this<00:04:17.609> one<00:04:17.760> just<00:04:17.880> because<00:04:18.000> you<00:04:18.180> have<00:04:18.299> so<00:04:18.479> many

00:04:18.620 --> 00:04:18.630 
this one just because you have so many

00:04:18.630 --> 00:04:21.080 
this one just because you have so many
more<00:04:18.780> options<00:04:18.989> not<00:04:19.530> necessarily<00:04:20.010> that<00:04:20.280> the

00:04:21.080 --> 00:04:21.090 
more options not necessarily that the

00:04:21.090 --> 00:04:23.180 
more options not necessarily that the
method<00:04:21.510> is<00:04:21.840> more<00:04:22.229> complicated<00:04:22.410> there's<00:04:22.979> just

00:04:23.180 --> 00:04:23.190 
method is more complicated there's just

00:04:23.190 --> 00:04:25.040 
method is more complicated there's just
a<00:04:23.340> lot<00:04:23.639> more<00:04:23.820> to<00:04:24.000> consider<00:04:24.150> and<00:04:24.479> it's<00:04:24.630> kind<00:04:24.990> of

00:04:25.040 --> 00:04:25.050 
a lot more to consider and it's kind of

00:04:25.050 --> 00:04:27.020 
a lot more to consider and it's kind of
easy<00:04:25.350> to<00:04:25.500> get<00:04:25.620> lost<00:04:25.650> coming<00:04:26.340> from<00:04:26.580> the<00:04:26.700> hero<00:04:26.910> 2

00:04:27.020 --> 00:04:27.030 
easy to get lost coming from the hero 2

00:04:27.030 --> 00:04:28.969 
easy to get lost coming from the hero 2
or<00:04:27.540> especially<00:04:28.260> if<00:04:28.470> you're<00:04:28.560> coming<00:04:28.710> from<00:04:28.860> the
