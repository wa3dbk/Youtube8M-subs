00:00:00.410 --> 00:00:05.940
 hello my name is jim rumen and you 

00:00:02.760 --> 00:00:07.470
 see indeed a comments about call of duty 

00:00:05.940 --> 00:00:09.599
 and that's what I'm going to wear today 

00:00:07.470 --> 00:00:11.070
 only on what I mean 

00:00:09.599 --> 00:00:12.450
 Last comments have told me that 

00:00:11.070 --> 00:00:14.610
 I definitely do not work or flood the 

00:00:12.450 --> 00:00:16.139
 ghosts wants to play before it now 

00:00:14.610 --> 00:00:16.440
 Let's start something in our own 

00:00:16.139 --> 00:00:18.029
 Thing 

00:00:16.440 --> 00:00:19.710
 this evening takes place on my own 

00:00:18.029 --> 00:00:21.480
 a small trailer and a town like that 

00:00:19.710 --> 00:00:24.269
 it is about doing things full and all sorts of things 

00:00:21.480 --> 00:00:27.060
 to ask questions about it 

00:00:24.269 --> 00:00:28.980
 the ea community manager max marilyn 

00:00:27.060 --> 00:00:31.050
 principle our contact for everything 

00:00:28.980 --> 00:00:33.180
 what was shared with and around and around 

00:00:31.050 --> 00:00:34.530
 could turn the whole thing is a full turn 

00:00:33.180 --> 00:00:36.420
 hang out and had in advance the 

00:00:34.530 --> 00:00:36.930
 possibility to ask about facebook 

00:00:36.420 --> 00:00:38.370
 put 

00:00:36.930 --> 00:00:39.629
 does not matter if he misses it 

00:00:38.370 --> 00:00:41.430
 you should also have 

00:00:39.629 --> 00:00:43.079
 during the hangout on the questions and 

00:00:41.430 --> 00:00:45.149
 answer function ask questions 

00:00:43.079 --> 00:00:46.620
 There is also a trifle 

00:00:45.149 --> 00:00:48.480
 to win that is certainly for 

00:00:46.620 --> 00:00:50.489
 especially for all console players for 

00:00:48.480 --> 00:00:52.140
 you interesting and I want to completely 

00:00:50.489 --> 00:00:53.250
 short the part here in the camera 

00:00:52.140 --> 00:00:54.719
 and if he does not do that at all 

00:00:53.250 --> 00:00:56.010
 It could be worth a lot 

00:00:54.719 --> 00:00:58.649
 So one can still quite good on ebay 

00:00:56.010 --> 00:01:00.690
 can additionally use in addition 

00:00:58.649 --> 00:01:02.250
 the whole process starts this year off tonight at 

00:01:00.690 --> 00:01:03.809
 19 o'clock normal on my 

00:01:02.250 --> 00:01:06.150
 chimp stop by youtube-channel 

00:01:03.809 --> 00:01:08.040
 gamer or just on my google 

00:01:06.150 --> 00:01:11.010
 plus profile drop by there you can 

00:01:08.040 --> 00:01:12.780
 to this question and answer function yes 

00:01:11.010 --> 00:01:14.040
 then trigger it or on it 

00:01:12.780 --> 00:01:16.380
 Otherwise, if you only participate completely 

00:01:14.040 --> 00:01:18.030
 watching normally over the channel then can 

00:01:16.380 --> 00:01:19.860
 one only under the video a comment 

00:01:18.030 --> 00:01:21.900
 post and that does not flow directly 

00:01:19.860 --> 00:01:24.390
 with one but the game can not 

00:01:21.900 --> 00:01:26.250
 foul hang car with the community manager 

00:01:24.390 --> 00:01:28.740
 this evening is 19 o'clock with today 

00:01:26.250 --> 00:01:30.000
 Of course Friday night I meant 

00:01:28.740 --> 00:01:31.560
 curious if he is on it 

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:33.150
 if not over you just look over there 

00:01:31.560 --> 00:01:34.290
 later on my channel to me 

00:01:33.150 --> 00:01:36.479
 Let's think that's a lot 

00:01:34.290 --> 00:01:39.270
 interesting questions still to be answered 

00:01:36.479 --> 00:01:41.670
 open are ingredients can fully clarify 

00:01:39.270 --> 00:01:43.829
 but now withdraws to the actual 

00:01:41.670 --> 00:01:46.079
 the topic in the background is his call of 

00:01:43.829 --> 00:01:47.880
 Duty big gameplay and yes I'm in 

00:01:46.079 --> 00:01:50.990
 Last video said stop on gold 

00:01:47.880 --> 00:01:53.310
 to play studios because yes this one 

00:01:50.990 --> 00:01:54.960
 exchange he is no longer allowed 

00:01:53.310 --> 00:01:56.759
 and yes, what should I say it has become 

00:01:54.960 --> 00:01:59.399
 crossed again happened 

00:01:56.759 --> 00:02:01.049
 Every time I go to one 

00:01:59.399 --> 00:02:03.360
 fix it or if I have one 

00:02:01.049 --> 00:02:05.009
 statement so totally knock me out 

00:02:03.360 --> 00:02:06.299
 so annoying so last time I know 

00:02:05.009 --> 00:02:07.710
 not at all what that was there 

00:02:06.299 --> 00:02:09.509
 but it happened to me and it is 

00:02:07.710 --> 00:02:12.170
 now determined four or five times in 

00:02:09.509 --> 00:02:14.510
 Follow as no statement 

00:02:12.170 --> 00:02:16.160
 x such as the fvw changer 

00:02:14.510 --> 00:02:17.660
 Banned or you can do it over the game 

00:02:16.160 --> 00:02:19.760
 do not hire that I have quite a lot 

00:02:17.660 --> 00:02:21.860
 news and comments are enough 

00:02:19.760 --> 00:02:23.080
 a hub here look because they have now 

00:02:21.860 --> 00:02:25.130
 unfortunately in the graphics settings 

00:02:23.080 --> 00:02:27.080
 integrated and thus communists show 

00:02:25.130 --> 00:02:28.640
 make people so honestly I 

00:02:27.080 --> 00:02:31.250
 always produce that a bit before 

00:02:28.640 --> 00:02:33.200
 that I do not always like that soo 

00:02:31.250 --> 00:02:34.610
 Realtime quasi things here upload that 

00:02:33.200 --> 00:02:36.319
 I also do it in between 

00:02:34.610 --> 00:02:38.480
 Normally I produce videos 

00:02:36.319 --> 00:02:40.010
 already one two three days earlier 

00:02:38.480 --> 00:02:41.510
 and when I recorded that 

00:02:40.010 --> 00:02:42.980
 you could not stop that yet 

00:02:41.510 --> 00:02:44.780
 or sitting no shit I've 

00:02:42.980 --> 00:02:46.069
 before extracting again started large and 

00:02:44.780 --> 00:02:48.200
 in the graphics settings I looked 

00:02:46.069 --> 00:02:50.000
 do not want to be stupid and there was 

00:02:48.200 --> 00:02:53.209
 no slider there were only the messages 

00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:56.120
 if you started the fv changer it did 

00:02:53.209 --> 00:02:58.580
 does not work anymore and has gone so stupid 

00:02:56.120 --> 00:03:00.470
 or in other words well run but me 

00:02:58.580 --> 00:03:01.850
 on the one hand, that's good 

00:03:00.470 --> 00:03:04.040
 now with built-in 

00:03:01.850 --> 00:03:05.299
 because so you can stop his perspective 

00:03:04.040 --> 00:03:07.430
 make a change for everyone 

00:03:05.299 --> 00:03:10.430
 you do not know what a f like so 

00:03:07.430 --> 00:03:12.500
 fv changer stands for field of 

00:03:10.430 --> 00:03:14.510
 view and that is meant by which 

00:03:12.500 --> 00:03:17.299
 perspective the game looks at that 

00:03:14.510 --> 00:03:19.940
 If you use the svw by default 

00:03:17.299 --> 00:03:22.310
 65 x I stand then has the stand 

00:03:19.940 --> 00:03:24.500
 you stare relatively in my eyes 

00:03:22.310 --> 00:03:26.570
 view you just look like one 

00:03:24.500 --> 00:03:28.160
 a little bit with blinkers so if you are 

00:03:26.570 --> 00:03:29.480
 everything is missing nothing more it is on the 

00:03:28.160 --> 00:03:33.560
 whole screen but sometimes has 

00:03:29.480 --> 00:03:35.450
 looks just relatively rigid or without one 

00:03:33.560 --> 00:03:37.730
 especially great excerpt if you want the 

00:03:35.450 --> 00:03:39.859
 fv now up a bit 

00:03:37.730 --> 00:03:41.480
 then the view will continue 

00:03:39.859 --> 00:03:44.030
 that means you get a bit like that 

00:03:41.480 --> 00:03:45.500
 such a vision as such a channel around 

00:03:44.030 --> 00:03:47.120
 frown, I almost said he 

00:03:45.500 --> 00:03:49.519
 so should a bird's eye view 

00:03:47.120 --> 00:03:50.630
 and why a fish eye so to speak and 

00:03:49.519 --> 00:03:52.070
 You can also do a bit more in that 

00:03:50.630 --> 00:03:53.690
 you can see a long way and you can never turn around 

00:03:52.070 --> 00:03:55.069
 the corners look normal at least 

00:03:53.690 --> 00:03:56.720
 not that is possible for some players, too 

00:03:55.069 --> 00:03:58.250
 but with ghosts I mean that 

00:03:56.720 --> 00:03:59.720
 do not work correct me if 

00:03:58.250 --> 00:04:02.900
 I'm wrong there, I do not have it now 

00:03:59.720 --> 00:04:04.880
 one hundred percent tried and so 

00:04:02.900 --> 00:04:06.680
 you just have the opportunity to be 

00:04:04.880 --> 00:04:08.840
 to expand the field of vision a bit 

00:04:06.680 --> 00:04:10.519
 means you can look straight ahead and 

00:04:08.840 --> 00:04:12.139
 but still sees something left and 

00:04:10.519 --> 00:04:14.060
 right next to one happens without that 

00:04:12.139 --> 00:04:15.440
 you look at me all the time 

00:04:14.060 --> 00:04:16.230
 What you do in between, though 

00:04:15.440 --> 00:04:18.150
 just do not stop 

00:04:16.230 --> 00:04:19.290
 so concrete and quite honest most 

00:04:18.150 --> 00:04:20.910
 I'll say something 

00:04:19.290 --> 00:04:21.480
 more professional shooter player 

00:04:20.910 --> 00:04:23.940
 I know 

00:04:21.480 --> 00:04:26.160
 all of which play with the fv 

00:04:23.940 --> 00:04:27.180
 at least 90 maybe even 95 or 

00:04:26.160 --> 00:04:28.920
 100 there are also those 

00:04:27.180 --> 00:04:31.170
 Professional with 110 games to find that 

00:04:28.920 --> 00:04:33.000
 I am very questionable because what 

00:04:31.170 --> 00:04:35.400
 happens then if you have his 

00:04:33.000 --> 00:04:37.170
 then expanded perspective 

00:04:35.400 --> 00:04:38.850
 Of course, everything is right in front of you 

00:04:37.170 --> 00:04:40.680
 victory must be a little smaller and 

00:04:38.850 --> 00:04:42.270
 this puts it a bit more distant 

00:04:40.680 --> 00:04:44.520
 that means it's something 

00:04:42.270 --> 00:04:47.040
 becomes more difficult in the true sense 

00:04:44.520 --> 00:04:48.690
 to discover or notice the things 

00:04:47.040 --> 00:04:51.960
 then a little further away that is, that is 

00:04:48.690 --> 00:04:53.580
 with small fv is there for me if you 

00:04:51.960 --> 00:04:55.170
 say a lot to do with it 

00:04:53.580 --> 00:04:57.210
 and not on left right so 

00:04:55.170 --> 00:04:59.970
 feverish by washing that does not need 

00:04:57.210 --> 00:05:02.010
 and a particularly wide fv is stop 

00:04:59.970 --> 00:05:03.840
 rather for the people I say now 

00:05:02.010 --> 00:05:05.450
 participate strongly in the gameplay and 

00:05:03.840 --> 00:05:08.700
 not verkämpft corner in them 

00:05:05.450 --> 00:05:10.110
 number so small tip on the edge yes that 

00:05:08.700 --> 00:05:12.270
 has happened in principle so you can 

00:05:10.110 --> 00:05:14.400
 about call of duty josef fouls 

00:05:12.270 --> 00:05:17.490
 but not again 

00:05:14.400 --> 00:05:19.320
 so high to 90 but only 80 85 

00:05:17.490 --> 00:05:22.820
 I do not think in my head right now 80 

00:05:19.320 --> 00:05:24.900
 that's it and that's okay on one side 

00:05:22.820 --> 00:05:26.490
 It is a compromise with which I live 

00:05:24.900 --> 00:05:28.230
 that means I can become one now 

00:05:26.490 --> 00:05:29.520
 expressive withdraw from last video 

00:05:28.230 --> 00:05:31.740
 and i will say no more 

00:05:29.520 --> 00:05:33.180
 call of duty play that is now 

00:05:31.740 --> 00:05:34.680
 no longer the case no i also play 

00:05:33.180 --> 00:05:36.420
 quite normal , many have 

00:05:34.680 --> 00:05:37.710
 of course also thought of and if 

00:05:36.420 --> 00:05:39.690
 I say something like that then I am mostly 

00:05:37.710 --> 00:05:41.490
 just a little bit for the moment 

00:05:39.690 --> 00:05:44.310
 Disappointed by a thing from the game 

00:05:41.490 --> 00:05:46.590
 now special and not necessarily from 

00:05:44.310 --> 00:05:48.330
 from the actual gameplay and so on 

00:05:46.590 --> 00:05:50.130
 and that's why it's not always 

00:05:48.330 --> 00:05:51.540
 one hundred percent seriously so yes 

00:05:50.130 --> 00:05:53.250
 if I meet such a statement then I am 

00:05:51.540 --> 00:05:55.980
 I mostly still in mine in mine 

00:05:53.250 --> 00:05:58.230
 rage or have just content on this 

00:05:55.980 --> 00:06:00.600
 thing and honestly if you just 

00:05:58.230 --> 00:06:02.880
 only the fv changer the external banned 

00:06:00.600 --> 00:06:04.260
 would have to without the intern with 

00:06:02.880 --> 00:06:06.390
 I would still have to bring in that 

00:06:04.260 --> 00:06:07.980
 found shit or 

00:06:06.390 --> 00:06:09.840
 I 'm in a video so clear 

00:06:07.980 --> 00:06:11.130
 to expressed and now it goes again 

00:06:09.840 --> 00:06:12.930
 Now you can return to normal 

00:06:11.130 --> 00:06:13.710
 you can set the fv over 

00:06:12.930 --> 00:06:14.700
 the game 

00:06:13.710 --> 00:06:16.140
 certainly that now everyone in 

00:06:14.700 --> 00:06:17.040
 or from now on 

00:06:16.140 --> 00:06:18.540
 seen 

00:06:17.040 --> 00:06:20.010
 Of course I have that too 

00:06:18.540 --> 00:06:21.810
 many comments already noticed and 

00:06:20.010 --> 00:06:23.910
 also at the whole news me 

00:06:21.810 --> 00:06:25.530
 have achieved and it has become 

00:06:23.910 --> 00:06:26.280
 Just guess again 

00:06:25.530 --> 00:06:28.320
 intersected 

00:06:26.280 --> 00:06:30.210
 It's always like that when he says you 

00:06:28.320 --> 00:06:31.920
 somehow at youtube is that and that 

00:06:30.210 --> 00:06:33.480
 not and works two days later 

00:06:31.920 --> 00:06:35.400
 then but and chris quite a lot of message 

00:06:33.480 --> 00:06:36.870
 with hey being fat but better 

00:06:35.400 --> 00:06:38.880
 you should research, you know that 

00:06:36.870 --> 00:06:41.040
 that goes so and so and hey of course 

00:06:38.880 --> 00:06:42.750
 especially in the moment in which I do that 

00:06:41.040 --> 00:06:44.520
 You recorded had there was not the 

00:06:42.750 --> 00:06:46.410
 or I have not seen it and now 

00:06:44.520 --> 00:06:48.330
 a few days later, it works 

00:06:46.410 --> 00:06:50.940
 ash on my main thank you for giving me 

00:06:48.330 --> 00:06:52.470
 because it helped or me so 

00:06:50.940 --> 00:06:54.480
 by supporting the whole 

00:06:52.470 --> 00:06:56.430
 have sent messages and in 

00:06:54.480 --> 00:06:58.710
 Of course , I will try for the future 

00:06:56.430 --> 00:07:00.510
 as soon as possible to produce the 

00:06:58.710 --> 00:07:02.700
 is the rausbringen the videos so that 

00:07:00.510 --> 00:07:04.740
 the information that you distribute there 

00:07:02.700 --> 00:07:06.450
 or on it also attacks the truth 

00:07:04.740 --> 00:07:08.220
 correspond I see stand at all 

00:07:06.450 --> 00:07:10.710
 not on such information 

00:07:08.220 --> 00:07:13.350
 of course that annoys me, of course 

00:07:10.710 --> 00:07:14.460
 and on the other side there is there 

00:07:13.350 --> 00:07:16.140
 But there are some people like that too 

00:07:14.460 --> 00:07:17.460
 Of course I'm a bit in the 

00:07:16.140 --> 00:07:21.360
 where I am 

00:07:17.460 --> 00:07:22.920
 then so thought so ok thinks it out to 

00:07:21.360 --> 00:07:24.450
 maybe you put yourself in 

00:07:22.920 --> 00:07:26.250
 maybe my perspective is 

00:07:24.450 --> 00:07:27.780
 video already a few days older why 

00:07:26.250 --> 00:07:29.160
 Are you writing such an aggressive one now? 

00:07:27.780 --> 00:07:30.990
 shit underneath but I have to 

00:07:29.160 --> 00:07:32.760
 well as youtube so that's why 

00:07:30.990 --> 00:07:34.050
 Okay, so call of duty goes 

00:07:32.760 --> 00:07:35.580
 of course that means I want the 

00:07:34.050 --> 00:07:37.500
 large series still continue to gamble 

00:07:35.580 --> 00:07:39.840
 I will also live with those at the 

00:07:37.500 --> 00:07:40.920
 streams to the call of duty goes gambling 

00:07:39.840 --> 00:07:42.990
 can etc 

00:07:40.920 --> 00:07:44.610
 blah blah so we are already at the end 

00:07:42.990 --> 00:07:45.780
 from the gameplay say thanks for watching 

00:07:44.610 --> 00:07:47.490
 I have here with just 

00:07:45.780 --> 00:07:49.170
 want to set the record straight and see you 

00:07:47.490 --> 00:07:51.830
 Of course, always next video skin in 

00:07:49.170 --> 00:07:51.830
