and<00:02:29.520> they<00:02:29.610> serviced<00:02:30.030> it<00:02:30.709> April<00:02:31.709> sixteenth<00:02:32.160> so

00:02:32.870 --> 00:02:32.880 
and they serviced it April sixteenth so

00:02:32.880 --> 00:02:37.780 
and they serviced it April sixteenth so
in<00:02:33.060> one<00:02:33.300> year<00:02:33.630> one<00:02:33.840> season<00:02:34.410> they<00:02:35.010> put<00:02:35.250> on<00:02:35.959> 250

00:02:37.780 --> 00:02:37.790 
in one year one season they put on 250

00:02:37.790 --> 00:02:41.780 
in one year one season they put on 250
nope<00:02:38.990> 205<00:02:39.990> hours<00:02:40.440> so<00:02:40.709> it<00:02:40.770> gets<00:02:40.830> 200<00:02:41.160> hours<00:02:41.670> a

00:02:41.780 --> 00:02:41.790 
nope 205 hours so it gets 200 hours a

00:02:41.790 --> 00:02:44.600 
nope 205 hours so it gets 200 hours a
year<00:02:42.230> which<00:02:43.230> is<00:02:43.470> a<00:02:43.500> bit<00:02:44.040> above<00:02:44.280> the<00:02:44.340> average
