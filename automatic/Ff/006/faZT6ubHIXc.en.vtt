00:00:01.100 --> 00:00:08.770
 good afternoon again we are 

00:00:03.770 --> 00:00:08.770
 watching our third chapter 

00:00:09.350 --> 00:00:13.940
 a house built with the sting system 

00:00:12.410 --> 00:00:16.000
 frame 

00:00:13.940 --> 00:00:19.360
 now we are going to 

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:21.700
 to see in this step we have already done as 

00:00:19.360 --> 00:00:24.119
 we have seen in the previous videos and 

00:00:21.700 --> 00:00:30.029
 we have done everything that has been implemented 

00:00:24.119 --> 00:00:30.029
 outside put the wichi membrane 

00:00:30.730 --> 00:00:37.150
 we have placed the openings we have 

00:00:33.640 --> 00:00:41.320
 guarded all the construction with the 

00:00:37.150 --> 00:00:46.440
 usb plates and now let's see how 

00:00:41.320 --> 00:00:50.500
 works or how the issue has been resolved 

00:00:46.440 --> 00:00:55.710
 from the roof in principle the roof though 

00:00:50.500 --> 00:00:55.710
 climbing to the ceiling has been resolved 

00:01:11.670 --> 00:01:20.770
 with systems as they can 

00:01:15.460 --> 00:01:23.020
 here is the download platform the 

00:01:20.770 --> 00:01:27.700
 download channel of all our 

00:01:23.020 --> 00:01:33.220
 system and this system is composed 

00:01:27.700 --> 00:01:36.940
 By wichi waterproof membrane we ask 

00:01:33.220 --> 00:01:39.070
 from below the cabriadas 

00:01:36.940 --> 00:01:40.590
 exposed with 50 glass wool 

00:01:39.070 --> 00:01:47.759
 millimeters 

00:01:40.590 --> 00:01:49.470
 and with corrugated sheet doing well the 

00:01:47.759 --> 00:01:53.300
 gutters 

00:01:49.470 --> 00:01:53.300
 how could I show here 

00:01:53.640 --> 00:01:57.060
 the view 

00:02:03.909 --> 00:02:08.969
 now we will see the subject 

00:02:09.360 --> 00:02:16.910
 of the placement of the plates 

00:02:13.910 --> 00:02:16.910
 cementitious 

00:02:18.520 --> 00:02:26.160
 exterior 

00:02:21.280 --> 00:02:26.160
 because I do not know but with time
