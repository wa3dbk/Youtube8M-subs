00:00:09.860 --> 00:00:14.759
 hello everybody welcome another video from 

00:00:12.450 --> 00:00:16.440
 Channel geo tv I'm Marcelo 

00:00:14.759 --> 00:00:19.070
 In this video I'll show you how 

00:00:16.440 --> 00:00:22.020
 will force a reboot of the 

00:00:19.070 --> 00:00:27.029
 windows is imagine the following situation 

00:00:22.020 --> 00:00:30.420
 you tried to shut down a server or a 

00:00:27.029 --> 00:00:32.369
 desktop by the normal method throughout my 

00:00:30.420 --> 00:00:34.079
 command line life is not 

00:00:32.369 --> 00:00:36.149
 he did not respond to 

00:00:34.079 --> 00:00:38.700
 commands and tidal so you have a 

00:00:36.149 --> 00:00:41.430
 option to force what is 

00:00:38.700 --> 00:00:42.930
 simply killing a case here at 

00:00:41.430 --> 00:00:44.760
 task Manager 

00:00:42.930 --> 00:00:47.910
 So I'm going to show you, I'm going to 

00:00:44.760 --> 00:00:54.870
 my work area involves the 

00:00:47.910 --> 00:00:57.480
 task manager for more details and 

00:00:54.870 --> 00:00:59.129
 I'll click on the details tab that shows me 

00:00:57.480 --> 00:01:00.359
 all the processes that are being 

00:00:59.129 --> 00:01:03.320
 executed 

00:01:00.359 --> 00:01:05.339
 This process here is from point xis and 

00:01:03.320 --> 00:01:08.310
 grandfathers and killing this process 

00:01:05.339 --> 00:01:11.299
 the machine will start automatically if the 

00:01:08.310 --> 00:01:15.240
 have you tried using the normal method 

00:01:11.299 --> 00:01:18.630
 through the command line and you come 

00:01:15.240 --> 00:01:22.380
 here kill this process and do not go there 

00:01:18.630 --> 00:01:26.970
 really is the alternative will have to 

00:01:22.380 --> 00:01:29.670
 be started even in the reset button is 

00:01:26.970 --> 00:01:32.340
 so if it is not in this way that 

00:01:29.670 --> 00:01:35.540
 It's not very complicated for you to click 

00:01:32.340 --> 00:01:39.829
 with the right button and end task 

00:01:35.540 --> 00:01:41.939
 He'll give you a warning here for you. 

00:01:39.829 --> 00:01:48.240
 warning that the machine will be 

00:01:41.939 --> 00:01:50.399
 reset here and close some 

00:01:48.240 --> 00:01:53.030
 seconds it will start the process 

00:01:50.399 --> 00:01:53.030
 startup 

00:01:53.630 --> 00:01:58.170
 so a lot happens there sometimes you give 

00:01:56.310 --> 00:01:59.969
 a kick down and the machine will not put 

00:01:58.170 --> 00:02:02.460
 nothing with this process to which he 

00:01:59.969 --> 00:02:05.670
 works also for brain windows 

00:02:02.460 --> 00:02:10.140
 mind we use in some cases 

00:02:05.670 --> 00:02:13.140
 ends do not get is this tip and he 

00:02:10.140 --> 00:02:18.840
 already starting to restart that the 

00:02:13.140 --> 00:02:23.459
 the machine to overcome a little there 

00:02:18.840 --> 00:02:26.510
 started then to get more of this tip 

00:02:23.459 --> 00:02:29.640
 important for you 

00:02:26.510 --> 00:02:32.790

00:02:29.640 --> 00:02:35.430
