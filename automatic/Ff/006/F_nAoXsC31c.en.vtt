00:00:17.300 --> 00:00:20.970
 hey people and welcome to 

00:00:19.560 --> 00:00:22.770
 another video of me 

00:00:20.970 --> 00:00:24.660
 Today I want to get in shape 

00:00:22.770 --> 00:00:26.610
 the more you thank us for that 

00:00:24.660 --> 00:00:29.779
 Over 200 times on the subscribe button 

00:00:26.610 --> 00:00:29.779
 clicked have a lot of fun 

00:00:35.950 --> 00:00:40.540
 it is therefore my current setup the 

00:00:39.340 --> 00:00:42.190
 exact name from my desk 

00:00:40.540 --> 00:00:44.470
 I can not say unfortunately because I already 

00:00:42.190 --> 00:00:46.000
 a bit older the table is in one 

00:00:44.470 --> 00:00:47.410
 some distance to the wall so that 

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:49.630
 light the led stripes correctly 

00:00:47.410 --> 00:00:51.220
 validity comes as close as possible to a set 

00:00:49.630 --> 00:00:52.720
 I have to keep myself minimal 

00:00:51.220 --> 00:00:53.290
 against a normal desk lamp 

00:00:52.720 --> 00:00:55.000
 decided 

00:00:53.290 --> 00:00:56.470
 instead, a big one will take care of me 

00:00:55.000 --> 00:00:57.370
 floor lamp next to the desk for 

00:00:56.470 --> 00:01:00.070
 enough light 

00:00:57.370 --> 00:01:01.750
 but now to the technical stuff my 

00:01:00.070 --> 00:01:04.570
 computer is currently the mac pro ley 

00:01:01.750 --> 00:01:05.920
 2013 in the standard configuration there 

00:01:04.570 --> 00:01:08.619
 especially when cutting from 

00:01:05.920 --> 00:01:09.880
 videos have expanded extremely much power 

00:01:08.619 --> 00:01:12.100
 I then still through a usb hub 

00:01:09.880 --> 00:01:14.229
 from isaac and a samsung dvd drive 

00:01:12.100 --> 00:01:16.570
 used for all video files 

00:01:14.229 --> 00:01:19.990
 a 2 terabyte big external hdd for 

00:01:16.570 --> 00:01:22.660
 usa little elements so the 256 gb 

00:01:19.990 --> 00:01:24.160
 internal memory are far too few around 

00:01:22.660 --> 00:01:26.040
 I use that to operate the mac 

00:01:24.160 --> 00:01:28.720
 apple wireless keyboard and logitech mx 

00:01:26.040 --> 00:01:30.580
 Master's mouse for gestures stands beside 

00:01:28.720 --> 00:01:32.290
 my keyboard still a magic trackpad 

00:01:30.580 --> 00:01:33.550
 which especially when surfing and 

00:01:32.290 --> 00:01:34.210
 when videos are very much appreciated 

00:01:33.550 --> 00:01:36.340
 White 

00:01:34.210 --> 00:01:38.740
 at my computer as over thunderbolt 

00:01:36.340 --> 00:01:40.000
 main 28 inch big samsung ultra hd 

00:01:38.740 --> 00:01:42.369
 monitor connected 

00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:43.899
 whose name I better not say with 

00:01:42.369 --> 00:01:45.550
 the panel I am more than satisfied and 

00:01:43.899 --> 00:01:47.800
 I also like the design of the monitor 

00:01:45.550 --> 00:01:50.649
 I really do not like the headphones 

00:01:47.800 --> 00:01:52.720
 I am using the logitech z 553 

00:01:50.649 --> 00:01:54.069
 speaker system the two boxes 

00:01:52.720 --> 00:01:56.050
 are right resp 

00:01:54.069 --> 00:01:57.610
 to the left of the monitor the subwoofer 

00:01:56.050 --> 00:02:00.369
 is under my desk and the 

00:01:57.610 --> 00:02:01.840
 volume control the monitor's sound 

00:02:00.369 --> 00:02:04.270
 the speaker is very clear and also 

00:02:01.840 --> 00:02:05.709
 The bass is not lacking here 

00:02:04.270 --> 00:02:07.300
 only sound but also 

00:02:05.709 --> 00:02:09.520
 of course , I own too 

00:02:07.300 --> 00:02:11.590
 a microphone the microphone of my choice 

00:02:09.520 --> 00:02:13.030
 is the blue blue bird the design is 

00:02:11.590 --> 00:02:15.010
 minimalist the audio quality 

00:02:13.030 --> 00:02:15.510
 terrific and the processing is real 

00:02:15.010 --> 00:02:18.220
 top 

00:02:15.510 --> 00:02:19.930
 because the blood is an xlr 

00:02:18.220 --> 00:02:22.030
 I use the blue microphone 

00:02:19.930 --> 00:02:24.130
 eyes hill as a usb audio interface 

00:02:22.030 --> 00:02:25.850
 because this is not the best 

00:02:24.130 --> 00:02:27.950
 I have it behind the desk 

00:02:25.850 --> 00:02:29.450
 Finally, I want you again 

00:02:27.950 --> 00:02:31.100
 explain how I managed it 

00:02:29.450 --> 00:02:33.470
 that one does not cable with my setup 

00:02:31.100 --> 00:02:35.330
 I see all cables for this first 

00:02:33.470 --> 00:02:36.740
 in a hammer cable box poked the 

00:02:35.330 --> 00:02:39.020
 remaining cable in a cable channel 

00:02:36.740 --> 00:02:40.850
 housed under my desk 

00:02:39.020 --> 00:02:43.130
 I have all cables with cable clips 

00:02:40.850 --> 00:02:44.450
 and grid walls attached the cables 

00:02:43.130 --> 00:02:47.300
 which lead to my mac I have in 

00:02:44.450 --> 00:02:48.920
 stowed away a blueliner stober that is 

00:02:47.300 --> 00:02:50.450
 So he my desk 

00:02:48.920 --> 00:02:52.010
 I have you all I buy 

00:02:50.450 --> 00:02:54.170
 found below in the video 

00:02:52.010 --> 00:02:55.400
 description packed once again a big one 

00:02:54.170 --> 00:02:56.600
 thank you that you my channel 

00:02:55.400 --> 00:02:57.410
 subscribed and not so great 

00:02:56.600 --> 00:02:59.360
 supports 

00:02:57.410 --> 00:03:01.130
 I hope that stays that way in the future 

00:02:59.360 --> 00:03:02.090
 but that 's it again 

00:03:01.130 --> 00:03:03.830
 with this video 

00:03:02.090 --> 00:03:05.570
 if you like it write me 

00:03:03.830 --> 00:03:06.860
 your my wounds in the comments and 

00:03:05.570 --> 00:03:09.820
 give the video a thumbs up 

00:03:06.860 --> 00:03:09.820
 Until next time
