00:01:42.420 --> 00:01:47.939
 I'm not going to chase now but so 

00:01:46.200 --> 00:01:50.220
 say I ran well well let's see 

00:01:47.939 --> 00:01:52.170
 how well the police drive around 

00:01:50.220 --> 00:01:55.380
 since i know what they are 

00:01:52.170 --> 00:01:59.250
 monkeys are over and how bad they are 

00:01:55.380 --> 00:01:59.640
 they drive even when my car has 365 

00:01:59.250 --> 00:02:03.030
 kp 

00:01:59.640 --> 00:02:08.580
 she with a broken wheel and barely goes well 

00:02:03.030 --> 00:02:09.959
 now I hope to fly away from them in vain 

00:02:08.580 --> 00:02:13.200
 probably did so because the change 

00:02:09.959 --> 00:02:16.610
 will unfold or the machine will end no i 

00:02:13.200 --> 00:02:19.860

00:02:16.610 --> 00:02:22.920

00:02:22.920 --> 00:02:28.079

00:02:35.640 --> 00:02:41.190
