00:00:09.139 --> 00:00:21.380
 she oppressed to constant attachment 

00:00:11.280 --> 00:00:21.380
 everything goes on like that 

00:00:31.520 --> 00:00:34.460
 then the minute repeater is the 

00:00:32.870 --> 00:00:35.360
 piece by the way are you going to sound the hour 

00:00:34.460 --> 00:00:36.650
 on demand 

00:00:35.360 --> 00:00:38.180
 it is to say that the watch is 

00:00:36.650 --> 00:00:40.760
 what time is it when asked 

00:00:38.180 --> 00:00:42.739
 the hour the room through the sound goes 

00:00:40.760 --> 00:00:44.930
 give us the time then the serious sound 

00:00:42.739 --> 00:00:47.150
 asthma or ring the hours the sounds 

00:00:44.930 --> 00:00:48.739
 treble will bother us the minutes and the 

00:00:47.150 --> 00:00:51.100
 serious and treble at the same time the 

00:00:48.739 --> 00:00:51.100
 quarter of an hour 

00:01:05.220 --> 00:01:09.010
 you have to know what you want before 

00:01:07.720 --> 00:01:11.500
 to start developing a repetition 

00:01:09.010 --> 00:01:13.120
 minutes and after we have to find the 

00:01:11.500 --> 00:01:15.670
 place for the different elements for 

00:01:13.120 --> 00:01:18.910
 that they are most adequately 

00:01:15.670 --> 00:01:20.800
 possible placed in the platinum at 

00:01:18.910 --> 00:01:22.840
 strategic locations will receive all 

00:01:20.800 --> 00:01:23.410
 the controlled valley stage components 

00:01:22.840 --> 00:01:24.430
 by step 

00:01:23.410 --> 00:01:26.320
 we will start to build it's the 

00:01:24.430 --> 00:01:27.580
 repetition minutes favor it in a 

00:01:26.320 --> 00:01:29.650
 minute repetition it's a once 

00:01:27.580 --> 00:01:31.030
 you have set a function normally 

00:01:29.650 --> 00:01:33.460
 no longer has to go back on it can pass 

00:01:31.030 --> 00:01:36.970
 the next step at helping 

00:01:33.460 --> 00:01:38.770
 adjustments to the settings of the parts that 

00:01:36.970 --> 00:01:40.390
 who works together there are 

00:01:38.770 --> 00:01:41.680
 a lot of adjustments to make so we 

00:01:40.390 --> 00:01:43.150
 is always with a file of 

00:01:41.680 --> 00:01:45.150
 tools adjusting functions 

00:01:43.150 --> 00:01:47.619
 did after sound adjustment at 

00:01:45.150 --> 00:01:50.140
 caliber level against the true 

00:01:47.619 --> 00:01:51.910
 Sound adjustment will be boxed because 

00:01:50.140 --> 00:01:54.340
 that the box really was also a 

00:01:51.910 --> 00:01:55.780
 important part of the sound of a 

00:01:54.340 --> 00:01:57.970
 minute repetition because she's going 

00:01:55.780 --> 00:02:00.070
 serve as sound amplifier the temple 

00:01:57.970 --> 00:02:02.350
 it's a hardened steel piece will do 

00:02:00.070 --> 00:02:04.149
 the turn of the turntable goes around 

00:02:02.350 --> 00:02:06.100
 bridges so these two cylinders that 

00:02:04.149 --> 00:02:07.840
 are superimposed on each other and 

00:02:06.100 --> 00:02:09.489
 offer it will do like a tuning fork on 

00:02:07.840 --> 00:02:12.100
 hammer when we're going to type the stamp goes 

00:02:09.489 --> 00:02:15.030
 make the metal piece vibrate and go 

00:02:12.100 --> 00:02:15.030
 we produce a note 

00:02:28.819 --> 00:02:32.969
 every minute repeater that is unique 

00:02:31.079 --> 00:02:34.079
 I have since I 've done it 

00:02:32.969 --> 00:02:36.150
 never succeed in doing this is two 

00:02:34.079 --> 00:02:38.250
 of such so they are close 

00:02:36.150 --> 00:02:41.010
 it's not big either 

00:02:38.250 --> 00:02:41.939
 differences but each repetition at its 

00:02:41.010 --> 00:02:43.560
 own sound 

00:02:41.939 --> 00:02:45.629
 it's a bit of a grail for 

00:02:43.560 --> 00:02:48.269
 the production watchmaker because that's 

00:02:45.629 --> 00:02:49.620
 a degree of complications where we go 

00:02:48.269 --> 00:02:51.959
 to combine one has the chance to be able to do 

00:02:49.620 --> 00:02:53.670
 the piece from beginning to end in 

00:02:51.959 --> 00:02:55.769
 being responsible for assembling the 

00:02:53.670 --> 00:02:59.090
 setting and then the icing on the cake 

00:02:55.769 --> 00:02:59.090
 the ringtone also of the watch
