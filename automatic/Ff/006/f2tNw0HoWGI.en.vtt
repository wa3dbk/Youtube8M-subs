type<00:02:40.470> in<00:02:40.680> CA<00:02:41.010> in<00:02:41.400> is<00:02:41.730> to<00:02:42.030> find<00:02:42.060> it<00:02:42.420> can

00:02:42.680 --> 00:02:42.690 
type in CA in is to find it can

00:02:42.690 --> 00:02:45.430 
type in CA in is to find it can
utilities<00:02:43.349> there<00:02:43.709> it<00:02:43.799> is<00:02:43.920> double-click<00:02:44.549> on<00:02:44.730> it

00:02:45.430 --> 00:02:45.440 
utilities there it is double-click on it

00:02:45.440 --> 00:02:47.960 
utilities there it is double-click on it
what<00:02:46.440> I<00:02:46.470> do<00:02:46.590> is<00:02:46.769> I<00:02:46.860> keep<00:02:47.069> it<00:02:47.160> down<00:02:47.310> here<00:02:47.519> in<00:02:47.730> my

00:02:47.960 --> 00:02:47.970 
what I do is I keep it down here in my

00:02:47.970 --> 00:02:49.910 
what I do is I keep it down here in my
taskbar<00:02:48.390> but<00:02:49.080> it's<00:02:49.290> already<00:02:49.500> down<00:02:49.709> here<00:02:49.739> as

00:02:49.910 --> 00:02:49.920 
taskbar but it's already down here as

00:02:49.920 --> 00:02:51.530 
taskbar but it's already down here as
you<00:02:49.980> can<00:02:50.040> see<00:02:50.190> but<00:02:50.700> you<00:02:50.880> can<00:02:51.030> literally<00:02:51.450> just

00:02:51.530 --> 00:02:51.540 
you can see but you can literally just

00:02:51.540 --> 00:02:52.729 
you can see but you can literally just
drag<00:02:51.810> this<00:02:51.989> and<00:02:52.049> drop<00:02:52.200> it<00:02:52.440> right<00:02:52.470> into<00:02:52.650> your

00:02:52.729 --> 00:02:52.739 
drag this and drop it right into your

00:02:52.739 --> 00:02:55.880 
drag this and drop it right into your
taskbar<00:02:53.160> like<00:02:53.459> that<00:02:54.230> and<00:02:55.230> then<00:02:55.349> you<00:02:55.470> have<00:02:55.680> it

00:02:55.880 --> 00:02:55.890 
taskbar like that and then you have it

00:02:55.890 --> 00:02:57.319 
taskbar like that and then you have it
so<00:02:56.069> what<00:02:56.370> I'm<00:02:56.459> going<00:02:56.579> to<00:02:56.610> do<00:02:56.700> now<00:02:56.849> is<00:02:57.030> I'm<00:02:57.180> going

00:02:57.319 --> 00:02:57.329 
so what I'm going to do now is I'm going

00:02:57.329 --> 00:03:02.479 
so what I'm going to do now is I'm going
to<00:02:57.480> hook<00:02:57.870> up<00:02:58.049> the<00:02:58.200> camera<00:02:58.769> so<00:03:01.099> to<00:03:02.099> starting<00:03:02.430> up

00:03:02.479 --> 00:03:02.489 
to hook up the camera so to starting up

00:03:02.489 --> 00:03:03.770 
to hook up the camera so to starting up
it'll<00:03:02.700> automatically<00:03:03.180> do<00:03:03.329> this<00:03:03.480> I<00:03:03.630> haven't

00:03:03.770 --> 00:03:03.780 
it'll automatically do this I haven't

00:03:03.780 --> 00:03:05.420 
it'll automatically do this I haven't
turned<00:03:03.959> off<00:03:04.110> the<00:03:04.260> automatic<00:03:04.410> settings<00:03:05.190> yet

00:03:06.860 --> 00:03:06.870 
because I don't like it automatically

00:03:06.870 --> 00:03:08.479
