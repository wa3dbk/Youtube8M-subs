spring to it every time you hit a key
the<00:04:12.510> crossbar<00:04:12.989> should<00:04:13.200> snap<00:04:13.470> back<00:04:13.680> into<00:04:13.709> place

00:04:14.770 --> 00:04:14.780 
the crossbar should snap back into place

00:04:14.780 --> 00:04:17.780 
the crossbar should snap back into place
however<00:04:15.780> if<00:04:16.169> the<00:04:16.530> crossbar<00:04:16.950> snaps<00:04:17.220> too<00:04:17.549> far

00:04:17.780 --> 00:04:17.790 
however if the crossbar snaps too far

00:04:17.790 --> 00:04:19.909 
however if the crossbar snaps too far
back<00:04:18.030> each<00:04:18.750> key<00:04:19.049> will<00:04:19.200> become<00:04:19.410> jammed<00:04:19.709> up

00:04:19.909 --> 00:04:19.919 
back each key will become jammed up

00:04:19.919 --> 00:04:22.310 
back each key will become jammed up
against<00:04:20.310> it<00:04:20.430> and<00:04:20.640> will<00:04:20.729> be<00:04:20.850> able<00:04:21.030> to<00:04:21.120> move<00:04:21.320> so

00:04:22.310 --> 00:04:22.320 
against it and will be able to move so

00:04:22.320 --> 00:04:24.350 
against it and will be able to move so
we're<00:04:22.950> gonna<00:04:23.040> have<00:04:23.250> to<00:04:23.400> brace<00:04:23.700> the<00:04:23.910> crossbar

00:04:24.350 --> 00:04:24.360 
we're gonna have to brace the crossbar

00:04:24.360 --> 00:04:26.420 
we're gonna have to brace the crossbar
back<00:04:24.630> from<00:04:24.900> the<00:04:24.990> keys<00:04:25.229> a<00:04:25.260> little<00:04:25.590> bit<00:04:25.770> so<00:04:26.310> that

00:04:26.420 --> 00:04:26.430 
back from the keys a little bit so that

00:04:26.430 --> 00:04:29.600 
back from the keys a little bit so that
it<00:04:26.550> can't<00:04:26.790> move<00:04:26.970> too<00:04:27.240> far<00:04:28.280> simply<00:04:29.280> take<00:04:29.490> the

00:04:29.600 --> 00:04:29.610 
it can't move too far simply take the

00:04:29.610 --> 00:04:31.100 
it can't move too far simply take the
piece<00:04:29.790> of<00:04:29.910> the<00:04:29.940> cone<00:04:30.240> that's<00:04:30.450> closest<00:04:30.960> to<00:04:30.990> the

00:04:31.100 --> 00:04:31.110 
piece of the cone that's closest to the

00:04:31.110 --> 00:04:33.650 
piece of the cone that's closest to the
spacebar<00:04:31.710> and<00:04:31.919> push<00:04:32.640> it<00:04:32.790> up<00:04:32.970> forwards

00:04:33.650 --> 00:04:33.660 
spacebar and push it up forwards

00:04:33.660 --> 00:04:35.510 
spacebar and push it up forwards
now<00:04:34.260> the<00:04:34.350> crossbar<00:04:34.830> has<00:04:34.979> something<00:04:35.220> to<00:04:35.310> rest

00:04:35.510 --> 00:04:35.520 
now the crossbar has something to rest

00:04:35.520 --> 00:04:38.680 
now the crossbar has something to rest
against<00:04:35.970> and<00:04:36.479> it<00:04:36.600> won't<00:04:36.870> snap<00:04:37.229> too<00:04:37.470> far<00:04:37.710> back

00:04:38.680 --> 00:04:38.690 
against and it won't snap too far back

00:04:38.690 --> 00:04:40.880 
against and it won't snap too far back
we<00:04:39.690> don't<00:04:39.900> want<00:04:40.050> that<00:04:40.169> piece<00:04:40.410> of<00:04:40.560> metal<00:04:40.860> to
