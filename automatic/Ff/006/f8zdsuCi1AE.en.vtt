00:00:04.450 --> 00:00:09.140
 Hello friends and subscribers of my channel 

00:00:07.129 --> 00:00:10.760
 on YouTube in this case I bring you a 

00:00:09.140 --> 00:00:14.300
 tutorial to update windows 8 

00:00:10.760 --> 00:00:15.500
 to 8.1 to me particularly I do not like 

00:00:14.300 --> 00:00:16.850
 update when it just came out a 

00:00:15.500 --> 00:00:19.520
 patch because it can bring more problems 

00:00:16.850 --> 00:00:21.320
 what advantages but good I prefer to wait 

00:00:19.520 --> 00:00:23.090
 few days I wrote a subscriber 

00:00:21.320 --> 00:00:25.190
 because I did not do a tutorial on how 

00:00:23.090 --> 00:00:27.350
 update to 8.1 and well I thought and 

00:00:25.190 --> 00:00:28.910
 I said why not all forms this 

00:00:27.350 --> 00:00:31.010
 Subscriber in particular is new 

00:00:28.910 --> 00:00:33.140
 computer Rodrigo I say it because if you 

00:00:31.010 --> 00:00:34.940
 I hid the system I will remember him 

00:00:33.140 --> 00:00:36.829
 until I can fix it 

00:00:34.940 --> 00:00:38.450
 well then let's update the first 

00:00:36.829 --> 00:00:41.239
 what we have to do is go to the store 

00:00:38.450 --> 00:00:43.730
 of microsoft click here and it does not come out 

00:00:41.239 --> 00:00:47.329
 in the store update windows 8.1 of 

00:00:43.730 --> 00:00:49.670
 free way we click here 

00:00:47.329 --> 00:00:51.920
 and tell us download this is the site 

00:00:49.670 --> 00:00:54.019
 to download the patch that more than a 

00:00:51.920 --> 00:00:57.760
 patch comes to be almost a system 

00:00:54.019 --> 00:00:57.760
 new operative that we are going to download 

00:00:58.300 --> 00:01:03.340
 and here it starts to download 

00:01:00.880 --> 00:01:06.850
 we have to wait a little while I take advantage 

00:01:03.340 --> 00:01:08.760
 to tell what's new in windows 8.1 

00:01:06.850 --> 00:01:11.830
 of this patch while it is downloading 

00:01:08.760 --> 00:01:14.610
 the main ones are that they return motor 

00:01:11.830 --> 00:01:17.130
 start button 

00:01:14.610 --> 00:01:18.840
 traditional mode boot the user 

00:01:17.130 --> 00:01:20.220
 You can choose when to start 

00:01:18.840 --> 00:01:22.290
 computer if you want the view of 

00:01:20.220 --> 00:01:24.750
 desk or the traditional more 

00:01:22.290 --> 00:01:26.550
 desktop personalization these are 

00:01:24.750 --> 00:01:30.080
 the news list of all the 

00:01:26.550 --> 00:01:32.490
 applications and tasks and multiple views 

00:01:30.080 --> 00:01:34.650
 another new universal search 

00:01:32.490 --> 00:01:37.200
 this application will happen to perform 

00:01:34.650 --> 00:01:39.510
 searches in local files the web 

00:01:37.200 --> 00:01:42.090
 skydrive and also applications 

00:01:39.510 --> 00:01:44.060
 compatible automatically too 

00:01:42.090 --> 00:01:47.630
 there will be automatic updates 

00:01:44.060 --> 00:01:49.579
 Total integration with the sky drive 

00:01:47.630 --> 00:01:51.320
 this means that the system can 

00:01:49.579 --> 00:01:53.390
 work directly with files in 

00:01:51.320 --> 00:01:55.490
 cloud without the need for an interface to 

00:01:53.390 --> 00:01:57.280
 synchronize them especially it also brings 

00:01:55.490 --> 00:02:01.100
 as new the new internet explorer 

00:01:57.280 --> 00:02:03.710
 which will be 11 and better control of 

00:02:01.100 --> 00:02:05.409
 mouse and keyboard new options 

00:02:03.710 --> 00:02:08.569
 configuration for active corners 

00:02:05.409 --> 00:02:10.940
 changes in the windows keyboard roller 

00:02:08.569 --> 00:02:13.099
 on the screen presentation of photos in 

00:02:10.940 --> 00:02:16.580
 the lock screen improvements in the 

00:02:13.099 --> 00:02:19.670
 Application system including mails 

00:02:16.580 --> 00:02:21.890
 music and photos compatibility with 

00:02:19.670 --> 00:02:23.360
 printers and 3d also I take advantage for 

00:02:21.890 --> 00:02:25.220
 tell you while still downloading 

00:02:23.360 --> 00:02:26.209
 that the first thing I've done 

00:02:25.220 --> 00:02:28.790
 been a backup of my 

00:02:26.209 --> 00:02:31.190
 files in case things get complicated and 

00:02:28.790 --> 00:02:32.690
 erez altamiranda keyboard 2.0 patrona de 

00:02:31.190 --> 00:02:34.730
 the computers because this new 

00:02:32.690 --> 00:02:36.349
 version 2.0 this protects both of the 

00:02:34.730 --> 00:02:37.610
 software like good hardware and 

00:02:36.349 --> 00:02:38.959
 taking advantage of this time while 

00:02:37.610 --> 00:02:40.849
 download the patch 

00:02:38.959 --> 00:02:42.230
 I also have to tell you that in the 

00:02:40.849 --> 00:02:44.569
 I will make a video with the shots 

00:02:42.230 --> 00:02:46.790
 false maybe to celebrate the thousand 

00:02:44.569 --> 00:02:49.220
 subscribers when you have them clear and 

00:02:46.790 --> 00:02:50.810
 right now I have about 500 though 

00:02:49.220 --> 00:02:52.130
 I really do not know if people can 

00:02:50.810 --> 00:02:53.200
 make fun or laugh when you 

00:02:52.130 --> 00:02:55.450
 they go bad 

00:02:53.200 --> 00:02:56.650
 I'm not sure maybe someone can 

00:02:55.450 --> 00:02:58.569
 laugh when I was wrong to make a 

00:02:56.650 --> 00:03:00.790
 tutorial for example I'm remembering 

00:02:58.569 --> 00:03:02.769
 of the tutorial that I did to replace the 

00:03:00.790 --> 00:03:05.080
 thermal paste where I put in the 2 

00:03:02.769 --> 00:03:07.090
 pasta and I had to repeat it 

00:03:05.080 --> 00:03:08.709
 several times and over every time 

00:03:07.090 --> 00:03:11.200
 he repeated he had to clean the processor 

00:03:08.709 --> 00:03:13.180
 and start over again and the other one the 

00:03:11.200 --> 00:03:15.190
 black screen that I finish in green yes yes 

00:03:13.180 --> 00:03:17.230
 in green where pissed off completely because 

00:03:15.190 --> 00:03:19.060
 everything went wrong I threw the mouse against 

00:03:17.230 --> 00:03:20.860
 the screen and when I went to grab it by 

00:03:19.060 --> 00:03:22.690
 the cable to avoid the disaster I 

00:03:20.860 --> 00:03:24.549
 agreement that the mouse is wireless is 

00:03:22.690 --> 00:03:26.319
 what is that funny that can make you 

00:03:24.549 --> 00:03:29.260
 Grace to someone and after turning off 

00:03:26.319 --> 00:03:30.760
 the monitor came back on with the 

00:03:29.260 --> 00:03:32.530
 hope that you still see something 

00:03:30.760 --> 00:03:34.630
 because the mouse hit only the area and 

00:03:32.530 --> 00:03:36.700
 leave a sting or a scratch and 

00:03:34.630 --> 00:03:38.769
 turn it on you only looked half screen and 

00:03:36.700 --> 00:03:40.239
 above in green that if that moment 

00:03:38.769 --> 00:03:42.430
 I go back to the camera and I focus my face 

00:03:40.239 --> 00:03:44.170
 I would have seen it purple to almost 

00:03:42.430 --> 00:03:45.610
 game with the green screen 

00:03:44.170 --> 00:03:47.890
 you think that funny how to do 

00:03:45.610 --> 00:03:49.329
 a video of false shots and then as 

00:03:47.890 --> 00:03:51.190
 the monitor was already ready to throw it 

00:03:49.329 --> 00:03:52.930
 that I unplug it throw it by the 

00:03:51.190 --> 00:03:54.819
 window when the neighbor was 

00:03:52.930 --> 00:03:56.920
 parking just your car on the sidewalk I 

00:03:54.819 --> 00:03:58.840
 I remember it and it's because I'm laughing 

00:03:56.920 --> 00:04:01.300
 I'll tell you another day how it ended 

00:03:58.840 --> 00:04:03.970
 from the funny neighbor go good and 

00:04:01.300 --> 00:04:06.370
 after this story of cash 

00:04:03.970 --> 00:04:09.010
 is still now checking the 

00:04:06.370 --> 00:04:13.470
 compatibility and we have nothing left 

00:04:09.010 --> 00:04:16.019
 wait if I will not remember the subscriber 

00:04:13.470 --> 00:04:18.329

00:04:18.329 --> 00:04:23.880
 says collecting information too 

00:04:20.880 --> 00:04:25.440
 I have to tell you that this update 

00:04:23.880 --> 00:04:28.620

 and we will see what happens 

00:04:47.310 --> 00:04:54.440
 it has taken an hour to download and 

00:04:50.340 --> 00:04:54.440
 install the 8.1 update 

00:04:54.540 --> 00:04:59.220
 in our moment it is restarting

 setting to 2% now we get the 

00:04:59.220 --> 00:05:03.200

00:05:03.889 --> 00:05:08.930

00:05:27.810 --> 00:05:32.850
 Yes, because you can wait half an hour 

00:05:29.690 --> 00:05:35.270
 Quick configuration set the 

00:05:32.850 --> 00:05:35.270
 account 

00:05:35.490 --> 00:05:38.610

 we have to put our email and 

00:05:38.610 --> 00:05:42.150
 password 

00:05:39.389 --> 00:05:44.610
 we give to change keyboard because it is 

00:05:42.150 --> 00:05:46.740

00:05:46.740 --> 00:05:50.460
 here we will make this screen where it says 

00:05:48.599 --> 00:05:52.319

00:05:50.460 --> 00:05:54.080
 we give down here right now I can not 

00:05:52.319 --> 00:05:58.120
 do this 

00:05:54.080 --> 00:05:58.120
 and we continue 

00:06:00.760 --> 00:06:04.720
 and now this screen does not come out says 

00:06:02.290 --> 00:06:06.580
 skydrive is your cloud storage 

00:06:04.720 --> 00:06:09.120
 in case we want to store all these 

00:06:06.580 --> 00:06:11.020
 data in principle at the moment 

00:06:09.120 --> 00:06:12.889
 deactivate this continuation of writing 

00:06:11.020 --> 00:06:16.749
 not recommended 

00:06:12.889 --> 00:06:16.749

 good operating system we get the 

00:06:26.590 --> 00:06:33.410
 message let's start to see if it's true 

00:06:29.670 --> 00:06:33.410
 Well, here we have it 

00:06:35.190 --> 00:06:42.270
 in principle, nothing changes 

00:06:39.080 --> 00:06:43.830
 follow the subway 

00:06:42.270 --> 00:06:44.910
 and the only thing I'm going to try is I'm going to 

00:06:43.830 --> 00:06:47.270
 you can investigate what 

00:06:44.910 --> 00:06:47.270
 you want 

00:06:47.590 --> 00:06:52.930
 is the internet explorer that in this 

00:06:49.330 --> 00:06:56.130
 version is 11 we go there and I 

00:06:52.930 --> 00:06:56.130
 I agree with the internet 

00:06:56.800 --> 00:07:01.629
 Well we have installed perfect 

00:06:59.889 --> 00:07:04.750
