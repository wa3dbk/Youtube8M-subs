00:03:02.960 --> 00:03:02.970 
university I don't think I could do both

00:03:02.970 --> 00:03:05.120 
university I don't think I could do both
at<00:03:03.209> the<00:03:03.239> same<00:03:03.299> time<00:03:03.720> so<00:03:04.290> we<00:03:04.470> would<00:03:04.680> like<00:03:04.859> to<00:03:05.040> do

00:03:05.120 --> 00:03:05.130
