00:00:15.100 --> 00:00:20.449
 still a game of the series bar challenges 

00:00:18.199 --> 00:00:22.669
 this time you can bet with yours 

00:00:20.449 --> 00:00:24.199
 friends just the coin I would put 

00:00:22.669 --> 00:00:26.179
 inside this glass 

00:00:24.199 --> 00:00:28.550
 yes because these four matches 

00:00:26.179 --> 00:00:30.919
 they depict a glass of 

00:00:28.550 --> 00:00:31.489
 martini with an olive inside we see 

00:00:30.919 --> 00:00:33.739
 how i did it 

00:00:31.489 --> 00:00:35.480
 here it is this is the glass is the 

00:00:33.739 --> 00:00:36.380
 meta represents the olive right there 

00:00:35.480 --> 00:00:39.770
 this is the challenge 

00:00:36.380 --> 00:00:43.070
 within two minutes but you have to be in 

00:00:39.770 --> 00:00:46.220
 able to redesign the glass in 

00:00:43.070 --> 00:00:47.660
 so that the olive is at the di 

00:00:46.220 --> 00:00:49.460
 out of the glass 

00:00:47.660 --> 00:00:51.230
 I'll give you an example. This is a 

00:00:49.460 --> 00:00:53.000
 glass moving only 2 cm x me 

00:00:51.230 --> 00:00:54.680
 I could redraw the watch glass 

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:56.960
 I invite you here and here at this point 

00:00:54.680 --> 00:00:59.500
 glass has changed direction though 

00:00:56.960 --> 00:01:02.990
 the olive continues to be new 

00:00:59.500 --> 00:01:05.799
 inside the martini glass 

00:01:02.990 --> 00:01:08.630
 this is the challenge within two minutes 

00:01:05.799 --> 00:01:11.900
 moving only two matches 

00:01:08.630 --> 00:01:16.690
 we must redesign the glass so 

00:01:11.900 --> 00:01:16.690
 such that the olive is outside 

00:01:32.780 --> 00:01:38.760
 here is the solution of the game of olive 

00:01:37.080 --> 00:01:40.530
 inside the car glass i 

00:01:38.760 --> 00:01:43.830
 two that are to be moved 

00:01:40.530 --> 00:01:49.160
 this basic is a lateral 

00:01:43.830 --> 00:01:52.440
 at this point a glass is recreated but 

00:01:49.160 --> 00:01:57.060
 the olive is outside the glass 

00:01:52.440 --> 00:01:59.340
 let's see again this move here 

00:01:57.060 --> 00:02:04.880
 at the base and the side will base here the 

00:01:59.340 --> 00:02:04.880
 side and the olive is skyrocketing
