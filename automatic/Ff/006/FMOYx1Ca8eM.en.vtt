 [Music] 

00:00:27.890 --> 00:00:37.220
 Hi girls, everything's good today, I'll bring it to you. 

00:00:31.250 --> 00:00:39.829
 You are the result of my fingernail 

00:00:37.220 --> 00:00:43.550
 some of you asked me at 

00:00:39.829 --> 00:00:45.949
 video that teaches to make the base with garlic 

00:00:43.550 --> 00:00:48.980
 and today I came to bring you my 

00:00:45.949 --> 00:00:51.409
 result that the union is huge and I 

00:00:48.980 --> 00:00:54.140
 I'm using it there's a little less than one 

00:00:51.409 --> 00:00:56.420
 month and I have a picture of the day that I 

00:00:54.140 --> 00:00:59.989
 I started the treatment, she 

00:00:56.420 --> 00:01:04.190
 it was there they were very small 

00:00:59.989 --> 00:01:07.180
 and now they are the wonderful names 

00:01:04.190 --> 00:01:07.180
 so hard 

00:01:07.369 --> 00:01:12.920
 I do not know if it went any further 

00:01:09.259 --> 00:01:18.140
 if it is to harden and I know they are 

00:01:12.920 --> 00:01:20.420
 very large and hard and that legal 

00:01:18.140 --> 00:01:23.479
 video I'll show you how I do it 

00:01:20.420 --> 00:01:26.060
 how do I base the way I paint and the 

00:01:23.479 --> 00:01:27.860
 So if you want to know how I did it? 

00:01:26.060 --> 00:01:29.509
 behind there is a huge 

00:01:27.860 --> 00:01:33.560
 just continue like this in the video for who 

00:01:29.509 --> 00:01:35.180
 I wanted to know if the base with garlic works 

00:01:33.560 --> 00:01:38.930
 I came here and show you my 

00:01:35.180 --> 00:01:41.710
 results with it and yet was the 

00:01:38.930 --> 00:01:41.710
 like this 

00:01:41.740 --> 00:01:48.200
 here it is only based and today I go 

00:01:46.009 --> 00:01:53.180
 They're doing it with a reason to do 

00:01:48.200 --> 00:01:56.360
 night the cuticle debuted already and I go 

00:01:53.180 --> 00:02:01.700
 do it today and then for anyone 

00:01:56.360 --> 00:02:03.740
 follow the video showing how I use 

00:02:01.700 --> 00:02:07.579
 the base with garlic 

00:02:03.740 --> 00:02:13.690
 For those who have questions, I'm going to take it. 

00:02:07.579 --> 00:02:17.019
 here today I just have it with her nail 

00:02:13.690 --> 00:02:17.019
 so I 'm going to take 

00:02:32.810 --> 00:02:36.620
 and she is like this 

00:02:43.840 --> 00:02:54.550
 and I'll be passing this tim award 

00:02:46.690 --> 00:02:58.900
 in the cuticle that this is from avon ó 

00:02:54.550 --> 00:02:58.900
 I'll be passing this way 

00:03:12.850 --> 00:03:21.670
 I finished the cuticle and are 

00:03:17.560 --> 00:03:24.430
 so and I'm going to give a window to the orixá 

00:03:21.670 --> 00:03:26.860
 much because they are already 15 format 

00:03:24.430 --> 00:03:30.120
 I want to please leave this 

00:03:26.860 --> 00:03:34.660
 broke the tip here 

00:03:30.120 --> 00:03:38.050
 And I think it's just that I'm going to take the 

00:03:34.660 --> 00:03:40.270
 but I'm not going to change anything and I 

00:03:38.050 --> 00:03:43.030
 I'll try more here that she broke neither 

00:03:40.270 --> 00:03:45.960
 this points out still an anger of the group 

00:03:43.030 --> 00:03:45.960
 then in a 

00:03:59.950 --> 00:04:04.690
 good girls games tite already bright 

00:04:02.680 --> 00:04:08.800
 I already did everything 

00:04:04.690 --> 00:04:18.660
 now it's time to move to the base 

00:04:08.800 --> 00:04:22.630
 Garlic has looked in here 

00:04:18.660 --> 00:04:26.139
 so it's the following I made that video 

00:04:22.630 --> 00:04:29.440
 many people wondered whether he could 

00:04:26.139 --> 00:04:32.320
 put inside the enamel if it could be 

00:04:29.440 --> 00:04:35.380
 on the colorless base which type of base 

00:04:32.320 --> 00:04:39.820
 this is my base is the solid base is a 

00:04:35.380 --> 00:04:42.850
 almost normal here may be the 

00:04:39.820 --> 00:04:44.500
 collor or silk I do not know if there are other 

00:04:42.850 --> 00:04:48.820
 other types of base I think it has 

00:04:44.500 --> 00:04:51.220
 these two but I do not know but what I 

00:04:48.820 --> 00:04:54.430
 I advise you what worked for 

00:04:51.220 --> 00:05:01.630
 I'll pass it on to you, it's as follows. 

00:04:54.430 --> 00:05:06.310
 I'm going to pass, I'm going to pass on and soon 

00:05:01.630 --> 00:05:08.770
 then I'll come in right away 

00:05:06.310 --> 00:05:13.750
 I 'm going through the base and soon in 

00:05:08.770 --> 00:05:16.510
 followed the enamel enamel people I 

00:05:13.750 --> 00:05:20.139
 I do not advise you to put it inside the 

00:05:16.510 --> 00:05:21.580
 because before you pass the 

00:05:20.139 --> 00:05:24.580
 Enamel you have to pass base 

00:05:21.580 --> 00:05:26.919
 first then the base that will have the 

00:05:24.580 --> 00:05:28.840
 direct contact with your nail 

00:05:26.919 --> 00:05:31.510
 so that's why we put it in the 

00:05:28.840 --> 00:05:36.160
 base I would advise not to put on the enamel 

00:05:31.510 --> 00:05:39.970
 unless you do not have the habit of 

00:05:36.160 --> 00:05:42.039
 before the new ones. 

00:05:39.970 --> 00:05:44.500
 That's why I advise you. 

00:05:42.039 --> 00:05:46.120
 put in the base because the base that goes 

00:05:44.500 --> 00:05:49.270
 have the money direct contact with the 

00:05:46.120 --> 00:05:52.090
 nail comes after the base then 

00:05:49.270 --> 00:05:54.849
 he will never have direct contact with 

00:05:52.090 --> 00:05:58.180
 the nail defended why it is better 

00:05:54.849 --> 00:06:02.110
 you put it on the base then come back 

00:05:58.180 --> 00:06:04.500
 passing here, I do not care 

00:06:02.110 --> 00:06:04.500
 pass 

00:06:05.740 --> 00:06:12.860
 I do not care to pass the base I 

00:06:09.350 --> 00:06:17.530
 I really base step and I guess 

00:06:12.860 --> 00:06:17.530
 which is what it does during my nail polish 

00:06:34.870 --> 00:06:44.110
 so I got my toenail 

00:06:38.410 --> 00:06:45.880
 I already spent two days in training and now I'm going 

00:06:44.110 --> 00:06:48.340
 is passing this wonderful rosé that 

00:06:45.880 --> 00:06:50.860
 I love passion so I'm going to pass. 

00:06:48.340 --> 00:06:52.720
 He's coming back to show you or 

00:06:50.860 --> 00:06:57.420
 paternal together in no secret 

00:06:52.720 --> 00:07:01.780
 And I'm going back to show you good people. 

00:06:57.420 --> 00:07:04.150
 I just turned up so cool, my nail 

00:07:01.780 --> 00:07:06.160
 I'm loving this pink as I told 

00:07:04.150 --> 00:07:13.300
 You 're with him soon. 

00:07:06.160 --> 00:07:16.930
 Look how beautiful he looks and I 

00:07:13.300 --> 00:07:18.520
 I spent a layer we stayed so I 

00:07:16.930 --> 00:07:23.140
 I think I do not need no need. 

00:07:18.520 --> 00:07:28.450
 I spend another and I loved it then. 

00:07:23.140 --> 00:07:29.350
 so are the nails and I will keep 

00:07:28.450 --> 00:07:35.860
 That 

00:07:29.350 --> 00:07:38.200
 this is the way I use the base with 

00:07:35.860 --> 00:07:42.250
 hot water doubt I showed how 

00:07:38.200 --> 00:07:44.410
 that I do this is the way I do 

00:07:42.250 --> 00:07:46.060
 That worked out for me 

00:07:44.410 --> 00:07:48.040
 now if you think it does not work 

00:07:46.060 --> 00:07:49.030
 a lot of people did and said they did not 

00:07:48.040 --> 00:07:52.240
 right 

00:07:49.030 --> 00:07:53.740
 I can not do anything there, I do not know what 

00:07:52.240 --> 00:07:56.920
 It gave me a supercert 

00:07:53.740 --> 00:08:03.070
 I'm loving it and I'm never going to stop 

00:07:56.920 --> 00:08:08.730
 to use is that's it 

00:08:03.070 --> 00:08:08.730
 I hope you enjoy kissing and joking.
