00:00:10.680 --> 00:00:13.800
 very good guys welcome to another 

00:00:12.810 --> 00:00:16.440
 video of this channel 

00:00:13.800 --> 00:00:18.480
 I have extracted the top 5 from the pokemon 

00:00:16.440 --> 00:00:20.310
 stronger phantom type like 

00:00:18.480 --> 00:00:22.200
 I always say in these top single story 

00:00:20.310 --> 00:00:24.170
 the pokemon that have this guy like 

00:00:22.200 --> 00:00:27.960
 primary and do not tell legendary pokémon 

00:00:24.170 --> 00:00:30.900
 and with that said let's start at 

00:00:27.960 --> 00:00:32.430
 number 5 have my Mayos my 

00:00:30.900 --> 00:00:34.650
 mothers a pokémon with very good 

00:00:32.430 --> 00:00:37.350
 special attack speed and defense 

00:00:34.650 --> 00:00:39.420
 special but on the other hand it has the 

00:00:37.350 --> 00:00:42.420
 very low health points the attack very 

00:00:39.420 --> 00:00:43.950
 low and very low defense too and it's 

00:00:42.420 --> 00:00:46.950
 that's why he could not upload more 

00:00:43.950 --> 00:00:49.649
 positions in this top in the post 

00:00:46.950 --> 00:00:51.600
 number 4 we have a triple drive inn more 

00:00:49.649 --> 00:00:53.280
 that nothing is placed here by the amount 

00:00:51.600 --> 00:00:54.960
 of health points you have since you are 

00:00:53.280 --> 00:00:57.120
 at number 7, which is really 

00:00:54.960 --> 00:00:59.730
 well because the other has a 

00:00:57.120 --> 00:01:02.340
 very bad special defense and defense a 

00:00:59.730 --> 00:01:04.110
 attack also quite low and the only thing 

00:01:02.340 --> 00:01:06.240
 that could be saved are the speed and 

00:01:04.110 --> 00:01:07.800
 the special attack but if it is here 

00:01:06.240 --> 00:01:10.590
 it's really about the health points 

00:01:07.800 --> 00:01:12.780
 but it's still very good pokemon in the 

00:01:10.590 --> 00:01:14.250
 put number 3 we have a game and the 

00:01:12.780 --> 00:01:15.900
 gang so I 'll be able to talk better 

00:01:14.250 --> 00:01:18.010
 since I come I use it a lot in the 

00:01:15.900 --> 00:01:20.410
 competitive and is one of my favorites 

00:01:18.010 --> 00:01:22.150
 have you stand out a lot for its speed and 

00:01:20.410 --> 00:01:24.700
 his special attack his special attack is 

00:01:22.150 --> 00:01:26.980
 something beastly but on the other hand it has 

00:01:24.700 --> 00:01:29.800
 very few health points very little 

00:01:26.980 --> 00:01:32.020
 defense and very little defense special thing 

00:01:29.800 --> 00:01:33.460
 that makes it practically paper I 

00:01:32.020 --> 00:01:35.950
 for what you used me more than anything 

00:01:33.460 --> 00:01:37.570
 come, it's taken out first and schalke that 

00:01:35.950 --> 00:01:39.760
 take me out I know he's going to die of a blow 

00:01:37.570 --> 00:01:41.830
 so he used the same destiny and as I am 

00:01:39.760 --> 00:01:43.240
 faster I'll just bring it to you 

00:01:41.830 --> 00:01:45.250
 go pretty well if I see that I can 

00:01:43.240 --> 00:01:46.810
 use it also from your special attack 

00:01:45.250 --> 00:01:48.700
 it is usually loaded some of a blow but 

00:01:46.810 --> 00:01:51.240
 I always recommend the same destination 

00:01:48.700 --> 00:01:53.759
 still it is very good pokemon 

00:01:51.240 --> 00:01:55.979
 in position number 2 we have chan of 

00:01:53.759 --> 00:01:58.259
 the chandeleur is one of the pokemon with 

00:01:55.979 --> 00:01:59.790
 more special attack there is a 

00:01:58.259 --> 00:02:02.460
 defense an emergency speed 

00:01:59.790 --> 00:02:04.530
 special decent I do not get out even very good 

00:02:02.460 --> 00:02:06.509
 but it is not that it is very bad and what 

00:02:04.530 --> 00:02:09.899
 worst to throw the no doubt is the attack 

00:02:06.509 --> 00:02:12.269
 really bad and the health points and 

00:02:09.899 --> 00:02:14.190
 we reached position number 1 where 

00:02:12.269 --> 00:02:16.650
 we have the only type pokemon 

00:02:14.190 --> 00:02:19.230
 ghost that could be considered a 

00:02:16.650 --> 00:02:20.540
 tank does night after not and has a 

00:02:19.230 --> 00:02:23.580
 defense and a special defense 

00:02:20.540 --> 00:02:25.019
 incredible really good for another 

00:02:23.580 --> 00:02:27.780
 part has a number of points of 

00:02:25.019 --> 00:02:30.510
 Very low health but a lot of speed 

00:02:27.780 --> 00:02:33.269
 very sad a special attack quite 

00:02:30.510 --> 00:02:35.130
 bad and an attack that leaves much to be 

00:02:33.269 --> 00:02:37.049
 wish the truth is that if they are used 

00:02:35.130 --> 00:02:38.880
 it is nothing more than its function as 

00:02:37.049 --> 00:02:41.700
 tank but that function makes it 

00:02:38.880 --> 00:02:43.440
 really good good guys I hope that 

00:02:41.700 --> 00:02:45.480
 you liked the video do not forget 

00:02:43.440 --> 00:02:48.060
 give it the xxi so dassin defends which 

00:02:45.480 --> 00:02:52.099
 you want it to be the next top 5 and we 

00:02:48.060 --> 00:02:52.099
 we see in the next video bye bye
