okay what we are attempting to do is the

00:00:03.659 --> 00:00:05.809 
okay what we are attempting to do is the
static<00:00:04.110> time<00:00:04.350> this<00:00:04.620> we<00:00:04.799> have<00:00:05.009> number<00:00:05.339> one<00:00:05.520> up<00:00:05.730> a

00:00:05.809 --> 00:00:05.819 
static time this we have number one up a

00:00:05.819 --> 00:00:08.419 
static time this we have number one up a
top<00:00:06.060> dead<00:00:06.330> center<00:00:06.720> we've<00:00:07.410> got<00:00:07.649> the<00:00:07.919> intake

00:00:08.419 --> 00:00:08.429 
top dead center we've got the intake

00:00:08.429 --> 00:00:11.839 
top dead center we've got the intake
valve<00:00:08.700> all<00:00:09.150> the<00:00:09.300> way<00:00:09.420> to<00:00:09.480> the<00:00:09.690> top<00:00:10.730> with<00:00:11.730> the

00:00:11.839 --> 00:00:11.849 
valve all the way to the top with the

00:00:11.849 --> 00:00:13.459 
valve all the way to the top with the
piston<00:00:12.269> all<00:00:12.389> the<00:00:12.509> way<00:00:12.630> to<00:00:12.690> the<00:00:12.900> top<00:00:13.110> or<00:00:13.410> the

piston all the way to the top or the
intake<00:00:13.920> valve<00:00:14.190> but<00:00:14.370> just<00:00:14.610> opening<00:00:15.089> with<00:00:15.299> a

00:00:15.320 --> 00:00:15.330 
intake valve but just opening with a

intake valve but just opening with a
piston<00:00:15.990> all<00:00:16.139> the<00:00:16.260> way<00:00:16.379> at<00:00:16.500> the<00:00:16.560> top<00:00:16.800> we<00:00:17.699> have<00:00:17.970> a

00:00:17.990 --> 00:00:18.000 
piston all the way at the top we have a

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:24.230 
piston all the way at the top we have a
multimeter<00:00:18.720> set<00:00:19.650> on<00:00:19.800> ohms<00:00:20.130> and<00:00:21.830> we<00:00:22.830> are<00:00:23.730> going

00:00:24.230 --> 00:00:24.240 
multimeter set on ohms and we are going

00:00:24.240 --> 00:00:27.679 
multimeter set on ohms and we are going
to<00:00:24.510> loosen<00:00:25.170> the<00:00:25.320> plate<00:00:25.650> and<00:00:26.240> gently<00:00:27.240> move<00:00:27.449> it

00:00:27.679 --> 00:00:27.689 
to loosen the plate and gently move it

00:00:27.689 --> 00:00:32.450 
to loosen the plate and gently move it
until<00:00:28.250> we<00:00:29.250> lose<00:00:29.490> I<00:00:30.029> believe<00:00:30.390> it's<00:00:30.689> our<00:00:30.869> beat<00:00:31.460> or

00:00:32.450 --> 00:00:32.460 
until we lose I believe it's our beat or

00:00:32.460 --> 00:00:36.880 
until we lose I believe it's our beat or
until<00:00:32.759> we<00:00:32.940> gain<00:00:33.210> our<00:00:33.450> beep<00:00:34.670> this<00:00:35.670> is<00:00:35.880> a<00:00:35.910> Honda

motorcycle<00:02:39.430> in<00:02:40.030> as<00:02:40.750> near<00:02:40.990> as<00:02:41.020> I<00:02:41.200> can<00:02:41.260> tell

00:02:41.580 --> 00:02:41.590 
motorcycle in as near as I can tell

00:02:41.590 --> 00:02:44.130 
motorcycle in as near as I can tell
about<00:02:41.710> a<00:02:41.890> decade<00:02:42.340> I<00:02:42.640> picked<00:02:43.600> it<00:02:43.690> up<00:02:43.750> a<00:02:43.870> couple

00:02:44.130 --> 00:02:44.140 
about a decade I picked it up a couple

00:02:44.140 --> 00:02:47.460 
about a decade I picked it up a couple
weeks<00:02:44.290> ago<00:02:45.390> when<00:02:46.390> all<00:02:46.540> through<00:02:46.870> it<00:02:46.990> fresh<00:02:47.230> gas

00:02:47.460 --> 00:02:47.470 
weeks ago when all through it fresh gas

00:02:47.470 --> 00:02:52.620 
weeks ago when all through it fresh gas
fish<00:02:48.000> oil<00:02:50.610> and<00:02:51.610> all<00:02:51.790> that<00:02:51.970> good<00:02:52.120> stuff

00:02:52.620 --> 00:02:52.630 
fish oil and all that good stuff

00:02:52.630 --> 00:02:54.870 
fish oil and all that good stuff
try<00:02:53.110> to<00:02:53.170> start<00:02:53.470> it<00:02:53.560> and<00:02:53.770> subsequently<00:02:54.550> caught

00:02:54.870 --> 00:02:54.880 
try to start it and subsequently caught

00:02:54.880 --> 00:02:59.190 
try to start it and subsequently caught
it<00:02:55.030> on<00:02:55.120> fire<00:02:55.800> and<00:02:56.800> since<00:02:57.280> I<00:02:57.700> have<00:02:58.240> got<00:02:59.020> the

00:02:59.190 --> 00:02:59.200 
it on fire and since I have got the

00:02:59.200 --> 00:03:03.420 
it on fire and since I have got the
points<00:02:59.709> check<00:02:59.980> the<00:03:00.100> timing<00:03:01.800> had<00:03:02.800> a<00:03:02.830> coil<00:03:03.250> of

00:03:03.420 --> 00:03:03.430 
points check the timing had a coil of

00:03:03.430 --> 00:03:07.710 
points check the timing had a coil of
smoke<00:03:03.880> so<00:03:04.120> all<00:03:04.300> new<00:03:04.450> coil<00:03:04.750> is<00:03:05.790> new<00:03:06.790> oil<00:03:07.120> new<00:03:07.450> oil

00:03:07.710 --> 00:03:07.720 
smoke so all new coil is new oil new oil

00:03:07.720 --> 00:03:10.530 
smoke so all new coil is new oil new oil
lines<00:03:08.140> and<00:03:08.940> completely<00:03:09.940> gone<00:03:10.180> through<00:03:10.420> the

00:03:10.530 --> 00:03:10.540 
lines and completely gone through the

00:03:10.540 --> 00:03:13.290 
lines and completely gone through the
electronics<00:03:11.370> so<00:03:12.370> if<00:03:12.459> it<00:03:12.550> starts<00:03:12.640> up<00:03:12.910> now<00:03:13.090> this

00:03:13.290 --> 00:03:13.300 
electronics so if it starts up now this

00:03:13.300 --> 00:03:17.670 
electronics so if it starts up now this
is<00:03:13.480> the<00:03:13.600> hour<00:03:14.400> it's<00:03:15.400> a<00:03:15.550> cold<00:03:15.790> start<00:03:16.030> people<00:03:16.680> hey
