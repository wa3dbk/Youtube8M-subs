a lot of scouts projected him at rounds
two<00:00:22.470> or<00:00:22.680> three<00:00:23.010> so<00:00:23.189> it's<00:00:23.220> kind<00:00:23.460> of<00:00:23.519> surprising

00:00:23.630 --> 00:00:23.640 
two or three so it's kind of surprising

00:00:23.640 --> 00:00:26.420

00:00:30.230 --> 00:00:30.240 
Thompson will start in about 16 I'm

00:00:30.240 --> 00:00:32.720 
Thompson will start in about 16 I'm
gonna<00:00:30.390> say<00:00:30.570> that<00:00:30.840> the<00:00:31.710> developers<00:00:32.189> give<00:00:32.369> him<00:00:32.489> a

00:00:32.720 --> 00:00:32.730 
gonna say that the developers give him a

00:00:32.730 --> 00:00:34.100 
gonna say that the developers give him a
little<00:00:33.030> bit<00:00:33.210> of<00:00:33.329> the<00:00:33.420> benefit<00:00:33.719> of<00:00:33.750> doubt<00:00:33.989> and

00:00:34.100 --> 00:00:34.110 
little bit of the benefit of doubt and

00:00:34.110 --> 00:00:36.470 
little bit of the benefit of doubt and
give<00:00:34.260> him<00:00:34.380> a<00:00:34.410> 65<00:00:35.040> overall<00:00:35.550> to<00:00:36.059> start<00:00:36.360> off

00:00:36.470 --> 00:00:36.480 
give him a 65 overall to start off

00:00:36.480 --> 00:00:38.270 
give him a 65 overall to start off
because<00:00:36.989> you<00:00:37.200> know<00:00:37.320> he<00:00:37.649> was<00:00:37.829> a<00:00:37.860> first-round

00:00:38.270 --> 00:00:38.280 
because you know he was a first-round

00:00:38.280 --> 00:00:39.770 
because you know he was a first-round
pick<00:00:38.579> but<00:00:38.760> overall<00:00:38.969> he<00:00:39.120> probably<00:00:39.360> should<00:00:39.660> be

00:00:39.770 --> 00:00:39.780 
pick but overall he probably should be

00:00:39.780 --> 00:00:41.389 
pick but overall he probably should be

defensive linemen that would be Charles

00:01:51.090 --> 00:01:52.999

Johnson<00:01:51.360> he<00:01:51.990> did<00:01:52.170> have<00:01:52.320> a<00:01:52.350> little<00:01:52.649> bit<00:01:52.799> of<00:01:52.890> a

00:01:52.999 --> 00:01:53.009 
Johnson he did have a little bit of a

00:01:53.009 --> 00:01:54.800

00:01:57.800 --> 00:01:57.810 
half less sacks this previous year but I

00:01:57.810 --> 00:02:00.050 
half less sacks this previous year but I
would<00:01:58.259> say<00:01:58.500> that<00:01:58.799> that<00:01:58.829> was<00:01:59.159> probably<00:01:59.670> because

00:02:00.050 --> 00:02:00.060 
would say that that was probably because

00:02:00.060 --> 00:02:02.690 
would say that that was probably because
of<00:02:00.630> the<00:02:01.140> fact<00:02:01.350> that<00:02:01.469> Greg<00:02:01.680> Hardy<00:02:02.159> his<00:02:02.340> running

00:02:02.690 --> 00:02:02.700 
of the fact that Greg Hardy his running

00:02:02.700 --> 00:02:04.069 
of the fact that Greg Hardy his running
mate<00:02:02.729> on<00:02:03.030> the<00:02:03.119> other<00:02:03.240> side<00:02:03.479> of<00:02:03.509> the<00:02:03.719> defensive

00:02:04.079 --> 00:02:05.780 
mate on the other side of the defensive
line<00:02:04.110> was<00:02:04.740> out<00:02:04.950> for<00:02:05.219> pretty<00:02:05.460> much<00:02:05.490> the<00:02:05.610> entire

00:02:05.780 --> 00:02:05.790 
line was out for pretty much the entire

00:02:05.790 --> 00:02:07.220 
line was out for pretty much the entire
season<00:02:06.600> amid

00:02:07.220 --> 00:02:07.230 
season amid

00:02:07.230 --> 00:02:08.660 
season amid
you<00:02:07.320> know<00:02:07.410> many<00:02:07.770> allegations<00:02:08.190> and<00:02:08.490> i<00:02:08.550> would

00:02:08.660 --> 00:02:08.670 
you know many allegations and i would

00:02:08.670 --> 00:02:10.790 
you know many allegations and i would
say<00:02:08.760> Charles<00:02:09.060> Johnson<00:02:09.300> will<00:02:10.080> actually<00:02:10.680> get<00:02:10.740> a

00:02:10.790 --> 00:02:10.800 
say Charles Johnson will actually get a

00:02:10.800 --> 00:02:13.070 
say Charles Johnson will actually get a
bump<00:02:11.160> in<00:02:11.340> overall<00:02:11.700> to<00:02:11.910> an<00:02:12.000> 87<00:02:12.510> overall<00:02:12.810> in<00:02:12.900> what

00:02:13.070 --> 00:02:13.080 
bump in overall to an 87 overall in what

00:02:13.080 --> 00:02:15.410 
bump in overall to an 87 overall in what
16<00:02:13.440> should<00:02:13.650> be<00:02:13.710> very<00:02:14.010> good<00:02:14.370> despite<00:02:15.060> having<00:02:15.240> a

00:02:15.410 --> 00:02:15.420 
16 should be very good despite having a

00:02:15.420 --> 00:02:16.940 
16 should be very good despite having a
little<00:02:15.690> bit<00:02:15.750> of<00:02:15.810> a<00:02:15.930> drop<00:02:16.380> in<00:02:16.530> production<00:02:16.770> I

00:02:16.940 --> 00:02:16.950 
little bit of a drop in production I

00:02:16.950 --> 00:02:18.770 
little bit of a drop in production I
think<00:02:17.130> that's<00:02:17.250> mostly<00:02:17.580> due<00:02:18.180> to<00:02:18.210> hardees

00:02:18.770 --> 00:02:18.780 
think that's mostly due to hardees

00:02:18.780 --> 00:02:20.330 
think that's mostly due to hardees

of<00:02:36.900> the<00:02:37.020> year<00:02:37.050> for<00:02:37.410> tight<00:02:37.650> ends<00:02:37.890> as<00:02:38.010> well<00:02:38.190> as

00:02:38.390 --> 00:02:38.400 
of the year for tight ends as well as

00:02:38.400 --> 00:02:40.700 
of the year for tight ends as well as
you<00:02:38.790> guys<00:02:38.910> probably<00:02:38.970> knowing<00:02:39.690> what<00:02:40.110> 15<00:02:40.530> and

00:02:40.700 --> 00:02:40.710 
you guys probably knowing what 15 and

00:02:40.710 --> 00:02:42.470 
you guys probably knowing what 15 and
I'm<00:02:41.040> gonna<00:02:41.190> say<00:02:41.310> that<00:02:41.430> Greg<00:02:41.610> Olson<00:02:41.970> gets<00:02:42.180> an

00:02:42.470 --> 00:02:42.480 
I'm gonna say that Greg Olson gets an

00:02:42.480 --> 00:02:45.050 
I'm gonna say that Greg Olson gets an
elite<00:02:42.750> finally<00:02:43.230> in<00:02:43.350> mud<00:02:43.560> in<00:02:44.100> mud<00:02:44.430> this<00:02:44.820> year

00:02:45.050 --> 00:02:45.060 
elite finally in mud in mud this year

00:02:45.060 --> 00:02:47.870 
elite finally in mud in mud this year
and<00:02:45.180> he<00:02:45.240> gets<00:02:45.390> a<00:02:45.570> 87<00:02:46.410> overall<00:02:46.980> to<00:02:47.460> start<00:02:47.730> off

00:02:47.870 --> 00:02:47.880 
and he gets a 87 overall to start off

00:02:47.880 --> 00:02:49.070 
and he gets a 87 overall to start off
the<00:02:48.030> game<00:02:48.060> I<00:02:48.240> think<00:02:48.390> he's<00:02:48.630> going<00:02:48.720> to<00:02:48.780> be<00:02:48.870> one<00:02:49.050> of

00:02:49.070 --> 00:02:49.080 
the game I think he's going to be one of

00:02:49.080 --> 00:02:50.390 
the game I think he's going to be one of
the<00:02:49.200> better<00:02:49.350> tight<00:02:49.590> ends<00:02:49.800> not<00:02:50.010> you<00:02:50.310> know

00:02:50.390 --> 00:02:50.400 
the better tight ends not you know

00:02:50.400 --> 00:02:52.880 
the better tight ends not you know
insanely<00:02:50.970> good<00:02:51.330> but<00:02:52.050> still<00:02:52.260> very<00:02:52.290> very<00:02:52.590> good

00:02:52.880 --> 00:02:52.890 
insanely good but still very very good

00:02:52.890 --> 00:02:54.470 
insanely good but still very very good
