00:00:15.219 --> 00:00:18.369
 there is no question of a cautious start 

00:00:18.369 --> 00:00:21.070
 that fall 

00:00:21.070 --> 00:00:24.070
 the chance for dost proud 

00:00:34.830 --> 00:00:37.830
 she just goes under the ball 

00:00:39.490 --> 00:00:42.380
 catchy summer the first pole barely restrained also gets one 

00:00:42.380 --> 00:00:44.220
 big mess of the mail 

00:00:44.220 --> 00:00:46.980
 and then you should not be surprised if the referee put the ball on the dot 

00:00:46.980 --> 00:00:49.980
 I think it's a penalty 

00:00:57.280 --> 00:01:02.090
 the timing state of the team therefore now may 24 good keeper must 

00:01:02.090 --> 00:01:05.090
 do it yourself 

00:01:11.340 --> 00:01:14.340
 almost had the shirt be taken off 

00:01:15.860 --> 00:01:17.960
 opponents say they don't 

00:01:17.960 --> 00:01:21.190
 good chance for michel breuer 

00:01:21.190 --> 00:01:23.710
 sunde asks it is a cross 

00:01:23.710 --> 00:01:26.710
 here is now 

00:01:29.420 --> 00:01:32.420
 leave your plastic behind 

00:01:33.210 --> 00:01:36.210
 so what is every neighborhood 

00:01:37.530 --> 00:01:40.610
 it's a shot of a laptop away Saturday is finally next to the goal 

00:01:54.740 --> 00:01:57.740
 three days 

00:01:58.540 --> 00:02:01.960
 berends 

00:02:01.960 --> 00:02:04.330
 look for the heading 

00:02:04.330 --> 00:02:07.330
 and there is the burden 

00:02:10.169 --> 00:02:11.249
 from the debutant 

00:02:11.249 --> 00:02:13.859
 cillises 

00:02:13.859 --> 00:02:15.799
 shorts 

00:02:15.799 --> 00:02:18.799
 flemings 

00:02:20.199 --> 00:02:23.199
 then choose positively 

00:02:24.279 --> 00:02:27.279
 and if your here is a fact 

00:02:39.379 --> 00:02:42.579
 before half-time it didn't work, this is a first action in the second half 

00:02:43.329 --> 00:02:46.329
 will be the Netherlands 

00:02:58.499 --> 00:03:01.499
 for 2 0 maybe 

00:03:10.539 --> 00:03:13.539
 let's see the defense of heerenveen 

00:03:14.289 --> 00:03:16.359
 two goals in two minutes 

00:03:16.359 --> 00:03:17.659
 fear is 

00:03:17.659 --> 00:03:20.509
 second of the season full of associate 

00:03:20.509 --> 00:03:23.509
 the government has a silk thread in it 

00:03:32.649 --> 00:03:35.649
 this sounding board group finds nonsense 

00:03:38.109 --> 00:03:40.469
 I'm not happy about that 

00:03:40.469 --> 00:03:43.429
 that is an answer says 

00:03:43.429 --> 00:03:44.539
 despite everything one 

00:03:44.539 --> 00:03:47.539
 it was by the way 

00:03:49.429 --> 00:03:52.259
 men 3 in it 

00:03:52.259 --> 00:03:55.509
 it immediately brings Heerenveen back to this good cross pass from 

00:03:55.509 --> 00:03:58.829
 beerens and this is not that easy at all 

00:03:58.829 --> 00:04:01.829
 so in the far corner 

00:04:03.139 --> 00:04:05.569
 pretty green dam 

00:04:05.569 --> 00:04:08.839
 dangerous anyway, but the referee approves 

00:04:13.399 --> 00:04:16.399
 for bass 

00:04:17.199 --> 00:04:20.199
 is it already called for the purpose of young a pin I think 

00:04:20.859 --> 00:04:23.859
 he has to see that 

00:04:24.939 --> 00:04:26.550
 beerens 

00:04:26.550 --> 00:04:29.309
 dissolve the jar 

00:04:29.309 --> 00:04:32.309
 good action world beer dost 

00:04:34.279 --> 00:04:37.479
 he is so eager to score a goal 

00:04:37.479 --> 00:04:40.479
 but this too was not an easy opportunity for bass dost 

00:04:42.930 --> 00:04:45.930
 something like that 

00:04:47.590 --> 00:04:50.590
 time is gradually starting to really push for Heerenveen 

00:04:52.629 --> 00:04:55.870
 Grindheim will be back again two years ago 

00:04:55.870 --> 00:04:57.789
 berends 

00:04:57.789 --> 00:05:00.789
 after those truckers there is always peer a cent 

00:05:02.080 --> 00:05:03.569
 I think in my own goal 

00:05:03.569 --> 00:05:08.289
 because that ball will get this weird turn but that will give Heerenveen legitimate care 

00:05:08.289 --> 00:05:09.419
 to be 

00:05:09.419 --> 00:05:12.089
 2 2 

00:05:12.089 --> 00:05:13.360
 turning green 

00:05:13.360 --> 00:05:16.210
 beerens 

00:05:16.210 --> 00:05:18.669
 heart for the goal 

00:05:18.669 --> 00:05:21.979
 and then the ball enters it by mail 

00:05:21.979 --> 00:05:23.580
 a 

00:05:23.580 --> 00:05:26.580
 the no that's it the ball doesn't 

00:05:27.110 --> 00:05:28.489
 it is indeed an own goal
