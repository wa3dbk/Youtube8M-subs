than<00:03:10.260> 12<00:03:10.560> months<00:03:10.740> my<00:03:11.430> prediction<00:03:11.880> is<00:03:11.970> that

00:03:12.590 --> 00:03:12.600 
than 12 months my prediction is that

00:03:12.600 --> 00:03:14.480 
than 12 months my prediction is that
savings<00:03:13.050> of<00:03:13.260> millions<00:03:14.100> of<00:03:14.160> people<00:03:14.370> is<00:03:14.460> going

00:03:14.480 --> 00:03:14.490 
savings of millions of people is going

00:03:14.490 --> 00:03:16.940 
savings of millions of people is going
to<00:03:14.640> vanish<00:03:15.050> and<00:03:16.050> this<00:03:16.230> is<00:03:16.380> just<00:03:16.500> the<00:03:16.590> beginning

00:03:16.940 --> 00:03:16.950 
to vanish and this is just the beginning

00:03:16.950 --> 00:03:22.250 
to vanish and this is just the beginning
so<00:03:17.630> I<00:03:18.630> would<00:03:19.350> say<00:03:19.530> be<00:03:19.880> prepared<00:03:20.880> and<00:03:21.480> act<00:03:21.989> now

00:03:22.250 --> 00:03:22.260 
so I would say be prepared and act now

00:03:22.260 --> 00:03:23.930 
so I would say be prepared and act now
the<00:03:22.530> biggest<00:03:22.709> risk<00:03:23.070> people<00:03:23.310> can<00:03:23.580> take<00:03:23.760> right

00:03:23.930 --> 00:03:23.940 
the biggest risk people can take right

00:03:23.940 --> 00:03:27.170
