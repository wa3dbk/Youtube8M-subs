00:02:19.840 --> 00:02:19.850 
know I kind of figured out that it was a

00:02:19.850 --> 00:02:24.070 
know I kind of figured out that it was a
language<00:02:20.709> pretty<00:02:21.709> quickly<00:02:22.570> and<00:02:23.570> that<00:02:23.750> I<00:02:23.780> had

00:02:24.070 --> 00:02:24.080 
language pretty quickly and that I had

00:02:24.080 --> 00:02:27.580 
language pretty quickly and that I had
complete<00:02:24.800> control<00:02:25.130> over<00:02:25.250> that<00:02:25.640> language<00:02:26.590> and

00:02:27.580 --> 00:02:27.590 
complete control over that language and

00:02:27.590 --> 00:02:32.979 
complete control over that language and
it<00:02:27.739> was<00:02:27.830> mine<00:02:28.420> and<00:02:30.580> to<00:02:31.580> this<00:02:31.730> day<00:02:32.000> if<00:02:32.480> I<00:02:32.660> start

00:02:32.979 --> 00:02:32.989 
it was mine and to this day if I start

00:02:32.989 --> 00:02:38.890
