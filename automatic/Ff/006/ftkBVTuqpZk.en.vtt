00:00:00.270 --> 00:00:04.890
 well and now we are going to see how it is played 

00:00:02.460 --> 00:00:08.160
 this song of bacilli 

00:00:04.890 --> 00:00:10.500
 start with an intro and before you see the 

00:00:08.160 --> 00:00:13.650
 Intro we must master the elements 

00:00:10.500 --> 00:00:16.080
 who are in this in this introduction 

00:00:13.650 --> 00:00:20.130
 there is a first element that is the 

00:00:16.080 --> 00:00:23.189
 sliding using is when 

00:00:20.130 --> 00:00:26.429
 we slide we press the rope with the 

00:00:23.189 --> 00:00:27.659
 right hand and then we slide with the 

00:00:26.429 --> 00:00:29.749
 finger that we are visiting in the hand 

00:00:27.659 --> 00:00:29.749
 left 

00:00:29.789 --> 00:00:36.030
 and we fall on a note that can be a 

00:00:33.930 --> 00:00:38.309
 top note 

00:00:36.030 --> 00:00:43.019
 or we can also start with a note 

00:00:38.309 --> 00:00:45.899
 acute and fall into a serious note and the 

00:00:43.019 --> 00:00:48.660
 symbology of this mechanism is a 

00:00:45.899 --> 00:00:51.120
 hairline an oblique hairline that joins two 

00:00:48.660 --> 00:00:53.519
 notes or is simply linked to 

00:00:51.120 --> 00:00:56.460
 a note and there is also an element that 

00:00:53.519 --> 00:00:58.949
 is used a lot in this song the trill 

00:00:56.460 --> 00:01:02.200
 which symbolizes it with a bow or a 

00:00:58.949 --> 00:01:04.510
 semicircle that joins three notes 

00:01:02.200 --> 00:01:07.990
 in the first note is where we press the 

00:01:04.510 --> 00:01:11.670
 rope with the right hand then we fall 

00:01:07.990 --> 00:01:11.670
 and so push hard 

00:01:11.920 --> 00:01:19.240
 and then pinch the rope so that 

00:01:16.360 --> 00:01:21.430
 the first note sounds again 

00:01:19.240 --> 00:01:24.689
 then we play practically three 

00:01:21.430 --> 00:01:24.689
 notes with a single touch 

00:01:26.180 --> 00:01:28.720
 and such 

00:01:30.250 --> 00:01:34.220
 good since you know that those two 

00:01:32.210 --> 00:01:37.310
 elements are included in this 

00:01:34.220 --> 00:01:39.170
 introduction I will slowly touch all 

00:01:37.310 --> 00:01:40.939
 this first part 

00:01:39.170 --> 00:01:43.479
 so you can decipher all the 

00:01:40.939 --> 00:01:43.479
 movements 

00:01:50.090 --> 00:01:55.370
 i 

00:01:52.370 --> 00:01:55.370
 Y 

00:01:56.410 --> 00:01:59.410
 i 

00:01:59.850 --> 00:02:04.500
 i 

00:02:02.340 --> 00:02:07.789
 and we start with the second part in a 

00:02:04.500 --> 00:02:07.789
 Arpeggio of D major 

00:02:10.509 --> 00:02:12.989
 Y 

00:02:19.769 --> 00:02:22.769
 and 

00:02:26.989 --> 00:02:29.989
 ah 

00:02:31.780 --> 00:02:35.840
 and 

00:02:33.360 --> 00:02:35.840
 Y 

00:02:36.040 --> 00:02:41.469
 ok and the strum we use in this 

00:02:38.680 --> 00:02:42.849
 song is the strumming number 34 that already 

00:02:41.469 --> 00:02:45.370
 we have used it a lot in other songs 

00:02:42.849 --> 00:02:47.769
 but in this song we have to give 

00:02:45.370 --> 00:02:51.629
 a special swing well we started with 

00:02:47.769 --> 00:02:55.220
 thumb down index up and 

00:02:51.629 --> 00:02:58.550
 cancel half index down 

00:02:55.220 --> 00:03:01.050
 thumb up 

00:02:58.550 --> 00:03:02.760
 off 

00:03:01.050 --> 00:03:05.000
 until we practice those five 

00:03:02.760 --> 00:03:05.000
 movements 

00:03:08.129 --> 00:03:12.819
 and then we add the three 

00:03:10.209 --> 00:03:16.420
 final movements that are index for 

00:03:12.819 --> 00:03:19.140
 up annular half index down and 

00:03:16.420 --> 00:03:19.140
 index up 

00:03:22.110 --> 00:03:26.640
 we put together the two parts 

00:03:24.550 --> 00:03:26.640
 i 

00:03:28.629 --> 00:03:31.629
 i 

00:03:36.730 --> 00:03:42.010
 good if you practice this receipt and not 

00:03:39.010 --> 00:03:44.739
 you get these immediate results not 

00:03:42.010 --> 00:03:47.110
 do not worry, do not despair because the 

00:03:44.739 --> 00:03:49.299
 strum is going to leave sometimes 

00:03:47.110 --> 00:03:52.030
 you can take out the movements but you can not 

00:03:49.299 --> 00:03:53.739
 the rhythm does not know the swing so that 

00:03:52.030 --> 00:03:55.660
 come out the swing you must have patience and 

00:03:53.739 --> 00:03:58.420
 then the rhythm will come out by itself 

00:03:55.660 --> 00:04:00.640
 do not despair and do it calmly this 

00:03:58.420 --> 00:04:02.530
 song is included in the pi 10 of 

00:04:00.640 --> 00:04:06.180
