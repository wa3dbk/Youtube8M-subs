00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.270
 hello guys with you harris and 

00:00:01.740 --> 00:00:06.089
 literally just released a new version 

00:00:03.270 --> 00:00:07.529
 minecraft 19 kombat update in this 

00:00:06.089 --> 00:00:09.450
 version developers just added 

00:00:07.529 --> 00:00:11.010
 a huge number of innovations and pro 

00:00:09.450 --> 00:00:12.540
 most of these innovations I will tell 

00:00:11.010 --> 00:00:14.750
 you in this video so sit down 

00:00:12.540 --> 00:00:17.130
 more comfortable and enjoyable 

00:00:14.750 --> 00:00:18.990
 yes as I said in this version was 

00:00:17.130 --> 00:00:21.240
 added just a bunch of things start 

00:00:18.990 --> 00:00:23.369
 new things blocks mobs and ending 

00:00:21.240 --> 00:00:25.710
 new world but also added 1 

00:00:23.369 --> 00:00:27.630
 very cool chip can now be taken 

00:00:25.710 --> 00:00:29.730
 any objects and tools in two hands 

00:00:27.630 --> 00:00:31.080
 that is, as you understand it is now possible to 

00:00:29.730 --> 00:00:33.059
 take one sword into the other with one hand 

00:00:31.080 --> 00:00:35.730
 another or not a sword from a pickaxe 

00:00:33.059 --> 00:00:37.440
 potion food and generally anything but to 

00:00:35.730 --> 00:00:39.390
 Sorry to kill immediately on swords you do not 

00:00:37.440 --> 00:00:40.649
 It can only be used 

00:00:39.390 --> 00:00:42.930
 as a sort of fast switching 

00:00:40.649 --> 00:00:45.239
 between things for example if you fight with 

00:00:42.930 --> 00:00:46.649
 the ball and the other hand you have the potion you 

00:00:45.239 --> 00:00:48.840
 can quickly switch between them 

00:00:46.649 --> 00:00:51.449
 pressing the letter f and treat yourself 

00:00:48.840 --> 00:00:52.829
 that's how it all works the same way 

00:00:51.449 --> 00:00:53.370
 second hand can be used for 

00:00:52.829 --> 00:00:55.230
 washing 

00:00:53.370 --> 00:00:57.329
 i.e. for example you go digging something 

00:00:55.230 --> 00:00:59.309
 and you suddenly need to get a sword you 

00:00:57.329 --> 00:01:01.260
 quickly press f and kill some 

00:00:59.309 --> 00:01:04.460
 zombies and so on and then further 

00:01:01.260 --> 00:01:04.460
 you can safely go about your business 

00:01:06.500 --> 00:01:10.220
 also this stone measuring stone 

00:01:08.420 --> 00:01:12.410
 touches and zombies and skeletons and other 

00:01:10.220 --> 00:01:15.050
 can links they, too, will be able to keep 

00:01:12.410 --> 00:01:16.280
 two swords 2 picks and so on and by the way 

00:01:15.050 --> 00:01:19.810
 stand for armor is now also possible 

00:01:16.280 --> 00:01:19.810
 insert two tools or object 

00:01:19.900 --> 00:01:24.260
 now let's show you some new ones 

00:01:22.130 --> 00:01:25.760
 subjects begin perhaps with the fact that 

00:01:24.260 --> 00:01:27.619
 archery was very strong 

00:01:25.760 --> 00:01:29.660
 changed now as you see when 

00:01:27.619 --> 00:01:31.100
 shooting the bow icon changes slightly but 

00:01:29.660 --> 00:01:33.260
 It's all bullshit compared to what 

00:01:31.100 --> 00:01:35.150
 Now I will show you and remember before 

00:01:33.260 --> 00:01:37.250
 we only had one kind of arrow now 

00:01:35.150 --> 00:01:38.810
 live just a huge amount of all these 

00:01:37.250 --> 00:01:40.070
 arrows can be used for bow and 

00:01:38.810 --> 00:01:42.500
 each verse has its own special 

00:01:40.070 --> 00:01:43.820
 property they work like a potion then 

00:01:42.500 --> 00:01:45.410
 there is for example a red arrow at 

00:01:43.820 --> 00:01:47.630
 hit will be the opposite to treat something about 

00:01:45.410 --> 00:01:50.330
 hit and zombies she will deal damage 

00:01:47.630 --> 00:01:52.130
 like the potion itself all these arrows can 

00:01:50.330 --> 00:01:54.320
 use pvp m on some maps 

00:01:52.130 --> 00:01:55.970
 minigraf and many other places besides 

00:01:54.320 --> 00:01:57.289
 regular effects individual developers 

00:01:55.970 --> 00:01:59.690
 added spectral boom 

00:01:57.289 --> 00:02:01.399
 she works very interesting when we and 

00:01:59.690 --> 00:02:05.140
 get into a man we can see him 

00:02:01.399 --> 00:02:05.140
 through the blocks and thereby know where he is 

00:02:06.820 --> 00:02:11.900
 Also in 19, a new one was added. 

00:02:09.200 --> 00:02:13.430
 vegetable namely beet this vegetable we can 

00:02:11.900 --> 00:02:15.290
 just like everyone else grow on 

00:02:13.430 --> 00:02:17.450
 the bed after which to eat it or 

00:02:15.290 --> 00:02:19.010
 cook beet soup understandable deal 

00:02:17.450 --> 00:02:21.650
 the soup stops more hunger than 

00:02:19.010 --> 00:02:24.370
 just beets so stuck out can be found in 

00:02:21.650 --> 00:02:24.370
 villages residents 

00:02:28.530 --> 00:02:32.860
 now all data can be found 

00:02:30.700 --> 00:02:40.420
 new things like new arrows 

00:02:32.860 --> 00:02:41.890
 items or potions are actually all that 

00:02:40.420 --> 00:02:43.900
 he just said a small part 

00:02:41.890 --> 00:02:45.610
 this huge update is the most 

00:02:43.900 --> 00:02:47.980
 interesting added to the inter world there 

00:02:45.610 --> 00:02:49.590
 divita and dragon firstly the fortress itself 

00:02:47.980 --> 00:02:52.829
 with the portal screw was slightly modified 

00:02:49.590 --> 00:02:55.390
 wooden doors and new blocks added 

00:02:52.829 --> 00:02:56.890
 Now let's start the winter world itself. 

00:02:55.390 --> 00:02:59.019
 perhaps the fact that now the dragon can 

00:02:56.890 --> 00:03:01.359
 let us fireballs and breathe fire 

00:02:59.019 --> 00:03:02.890
 and those weird blocks that i am his 

00:03:01.359 --> 00:03:04.480
 now protected by iron bars 

00:03:02.890 --> 00:03:06.519
 so that they cannot be blown up by 

00:03:04.480 --> 00:03:08.590
 onions but kill the dragon still 

00:03:06.519 --> 00:03:10.480
 quite simple especially using new ones 

00:03:08.590 --> 00:03:12.819
 arrows and when you kill the dragon 

00:03:10.480 --> 00:03:14.470
 the fun begins after him 

00:03:12.819 --> 00:03:17.200
 death ray appears to randomly place 

00:03:14.470 --> 00:03:18.639
 how from mine to you need to go to him there 

00:03:17.200 --> 00:03:20.980
 there will be another portal that leads to 

00:03:18.639 --> 00:03:24.129
 new world you just jump into it and 

00:03:20.980 --> 00:03:26.079
 get into this place grow new here 

00:03:24.129 --> 00:03:28.000
 plants that is yes yes these blocks and 

00:03:26.079 --> 00:03:31.000
 in general, this world itself is quite large 

00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:32.650
 just many times more than the inter research 

00:03:31.000 --> 00:03:34.840
 plants can be easily collected as a cactus 

00:03:32.650 --> 00:03:36.910
 and craft new blocks but the most 

00:03:34.840 --> 00:03:38.500
 interesting yet to fly a little 

00:03:36.910 --> 00:03:40.930
 in this world you stumble upon such 

00:03:38.500 --> 00:03:42.639
 strange buildings these buildings consist 

00:03:40.930 --> 00:03:43.959
 completely from new blocks and they have 

00:03:42.639 --> 00:03:46.329
 very valuable thing and 

00:03:43.959 --> 00:03:49.569
 such as enchanted swords are precious 

00:03:46.329 --> 00:03:51.730
 blocks and even a beacon but be careful these 

00:03:49.569 --> 00:03:53.230
 buildings protect new mob this one could not 

00:03:51.730 --> 00:03:53.650
 similar in its properties to none of 

00:03:53.230 --> 00:03:55.569
 of old 

00:03:53.650 --> 00:03:57.069
 his trick is that he opens when 

00:03:55.569 --> 00:03:59.680
 we approach him and shoot us 

00:03:57.069 --> 00:04:01.870
 such a strange ball deals damage 

00:03:59.680 --> 00:04:04.060
 a small not of this ball we take off and 

00:04:01.870 --> 00:04:05.379
 can't go down until we drop like that 

00:04:04.060 --> 00:04:08.849
 that if you fight this about 

00:04:05.379 --> 00:04:08.849
 you need boots in zero gravity 

00:04:12.190 --> 00:04:16.130
 these are the blocks you can find in this 

00:04:14.420 --> 00:04:18.080
 the world for the most part is just 

00:04:16.130 --> 00:04:19.610
 scenery but they look pretty 

00:04:18.080 --> 00:04:24.680
 fun and harder to blow 

00:04:19.610 --> 00:04:26.090
 dynamite than ordinary blocks also was 

00:04:24.680 --> 00:04:27.800
 many small bugs fixed 

00:04:26.090 --> 00:04:29.420
 but I have already decided not to talk about it much 

00:04:27.800 --> 00:04:32.090
 because it does almost every 

00:04:29.420 --> 00:04:33.740
 version essentially versions 19 added 

00:04:32.090 --> 00:04:35.840
 mangrove the opportunity to enjoy the second 

00:04:33.740 --> 00:04:37.160
 hand a lot of new blocks and items 

00:04:35.840 --> 00:04:39.560
 so many new arrows 

00:04:37.160 --> 00:04:41.420
 as well as new world and new mobs personally 

00:04:39.560 --> 00:04:42.350
 I really liked this version and its 

00:04:41.420 --> 00:04:44.660
 opinion you can write in the comments 

00:04:42.350 --> 00:04:46.220
