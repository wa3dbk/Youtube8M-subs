00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.640 

I<00:00:00.089> thought<00:00:00.420> I'd<00:00:00.570> do<00:00:00.719> a<00:00:00.750> video<00:00:00.930> today<00:00:01.290> on<00:00:01.410> the

00:00:01.640 --> 00:00:01.650 
I thought I'd do a video today on the

00:00:01.650 --> 00:00:03.379 
I thought I'd do a video today on the
differences<00:00:02.190> between<00:00:02.250> trench<00:00:02.850> coats<00:00:03.149> and

00:00:03.379 --> 00:00:03.389 
differences between trench coats and

00:00:03.389 --> 00:00:04.700 
differences between trench coats and
great<00:00:03.570> coats<00:00:03.840> because<00:00:04.110> the<00:00:04.259> words<00:00:04.440> are<00:00:04.589> used

00:00:04.700 --> 00:00:04.710 
great coats because the words are used

00:00:04.710 --> 00:00:06.889 
great coats because the words are used
interchangeably<00:00:04.890> a<00:00:05.609> lot<00:00:05.819> I<00:00:06.060> admit<00:00:06.690> I've<00:00:06.870> done

00:00:06.889 --> 00:00:06.899 
interchangeably a lot I admit I've done

00:00:06.899 --> 00:00:10.400 
interchangeably a lot I admit I've done
it<00:00:07.200> before<00:00:07.379> and<00:00:08.570> it<00:00:09.570> does<00:00:09.719> get<00:00:09.870> a<00:00:09.929> bit<00:00:10.139> annoying

00:00:10.400 --> 00:00:10.410 
it before and it does get a bit annoying

00:00:10.410 --> 00:00:11.990 
it before and it does get a bit annoying
when<00:00:10.769> you<00:00:10.920> can't<00:00:11.160> actually<00:00:11.309> find<00:00:11.639> out<00:00:11.820> if

00:00:11.990 --> 00:00:12.000 
when you can't actually find out if

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:13.490 
when you can't actually find out if
something<00:00:12.330> really<00:00:12.509> is<00:00:12.719> a<00:00:12.750> trench<00:00:13.080> coat<00:00:13.170> or<00:00:13.469> a

00:00:13.490 --> 00:00:13.500 
something really is a trench coat or a

00:00:13.500 --> 00:00:15.259 
something really is a trench coat or a
great<00:00:13.769> coat<00:00:14.009> because<00:00:14.190> people<00:00:14.610> don't<00:00:14.849> know<00:00:15.210> the

00:00:15.259 --> 00:00:15.269 
great coat because people don't know the

00:00:15.269 --> 00:00:18.080

about three pounds there's nobody else
bid<00:00:39.480> on<00:00:39.600> it<00:00:40.309> so<00:00:41.540> basically<00:00:42.770> we'll<00:00:43.770> get<00:00:43.950> up<00:00:44.040> a

00:00:44.119 --> 00:00:44.129 
bid on it so basically we'll get up a

00:00:44.129 --> 00:00:45.380 
bid on it so basically we'll get up a
bit<00:00:44.280> closer<00:00:44.550> to<00:00:44.789> them<00:00:44.879> and<00:00:44.969> I'll<00:00:45.059> explain<00:00:45.329> the

00:00:45.380 --> 00:00:45.390 
bit closer to them and I'll explain the

00:00:45.390 --> 00:00:47.569 
bit closer to them and I'll explain the
differences<00:00:45.899> but<00:00:46.140> as<00:00:46.230> you<00:00:46.379> can<00:00:46.530> see<00:00:46.739> both<00:00:47.010> look

00:00:47.569 --> 00:00:47.579 
differences but as you can see both look

00:00:47.579 --> 00:00:49.819 
differences but as you can see both look
very<00:00:47.879> similar<00:00:48.390> in<00:00:48.570> terms<00:00:48.750> of<00:00:49.140> the<00:00:49.379> actual

00:00:49.819 --> 00:00:49.829 
very similar in terms of the actual

00:00:49.829 --> 00:00:51.979 
very similar in terms of the actual
style<00:00:50.129> the<00:00:51.059> East<00:00:51.180> German<00:00:51.480> one's<00:00:51.629> slightly

00:00:51.979 --> 00:00:51.989 
style the East German one's slightly

00:00:51.989 --> 00:00:53.510 
style the East German one's slightly
bigger<00:00:52.379> but<00:00:52.649> that<00:00:52.800> might<00:00:53.039> be<00:00:53.190> just<00:00:53.399> because

00:00:53.510 --> 00:00:53.520 
bigger but that might be just because

00:00:53.520 --> 00:00:57.350 
bigger but that might be just because
it's<00:00:53.879> a<00:00:54.000> slightly<00:00:54.300> larger<00:00:54.539> size<00:00:56.360> hopefully

00:00:57.350 --> 00:00:57.360 
it's a slightly larger size hopefully

00:00:57.360 --> 00:00:58.760 
it's a slightly larger size hopefully
you<00:00:57.480> can<00:00:57.600> see<00:00:57.840> from<00:00:58.050> this<00:00:58.199> that<00:00:58.410> this<00:00:58.530> is<00:00:58.649> an

00:00:58.760 --> 00:00:58.770 
you can see from this that this is an

00:00:58.770 --> 00:01:01.970 
you can see from this that this is an
actual<00:00:59.100> sort<00:00:59.399> of<00:00:59.489> waterproof<00:00:59.910> II<00:01:00.649> quite<00:01:01.649> thin

what confuses things more is you get

00:02:18.710 --> 00:02:18.720 
and that's what you get a lot more since

00:02:18.720 --> 00:02:20.600 
and that's what you get a lot more since
I<00:02:18.840> suppose<00:02:19.080> the<00:02:19.200> matrix<00:02:19.380> became<00:02:19.980> popular<00:02:20.430> as

00:02:20.600 --> 00:02:20.610 
I suppose the matrix became popular as

00:02:20.610 --> 00:02:22.580 
I suppose the matrix became popular as
leather<00:02:20.910> trench<00:02:21.180> coats<00:02:21.510> being<00:02:21.780> sold<00:02:22.140> sort<00:02:22.530> of

00:02:25.040 --> 00:02:25.050 
you know very bad quality things which

makes people trench coats are sort of

00:02:27.600 --> 00:02:31.729 
makes people trench coats are sort of
these<00:02:27.810> very<00:02:28.200> badly<00:02:28.470> cut<00:02:28.800> leather<00:02:29.040> coats<00:02:30.739> and

these very badly cut leather coats and

these very badly cut leather coats and
low<00:02:32.340> I<00:02:32.670> think<00:02:32.880> Nazis<00:02:33.450> did<00:02:33.630> have<00:02:33.720> leather

00:02:34.010 --> 00:02:34.020 
low I think Nazis did have leather

low I think Nazis did have leather
trench<00:02:34.380> coats<00:02:34.739> at<00:02:34.890> some<00:02:35.069> stages<00:02:35.370> the<00:02:36.000> idea<00:02:36.540> is

00:02:36.650 --> 00:02:36.660 
trench coats at some stages the idea is

00:02:36.660 --> 00:02:37.910 
trench coats at some stages the idea is
that<00:02:36.690> level<00:02:37.050> protects<00:02:37.530> you<00:02:37.650> from<00:02:37.680> the

00:02:37.910 --> 00:02:37.920 
that level protects you from the

00:02:37.920 --> 00:02:39.710 
that level protects you from the
elements<00:02:38.010> and<00:02:38.489> is<00:02:38.760> a<00:02:38.790> bit<00:02:39.060> warmer<00:02:39.450> than<00:02:39.480> the

00:02:39.710 --> 00:02:39.720 
elements and is a bit warmer than the

00:02:39.720 --> 00:02:41.979 
elements and is a bit warmer than the
sort<00:02:39.930> of<00:02:39.989> material<00:02:40.500> this<00:02:40.620> is<00:02:40.680> made<00:02:40.950> out<00:02:41.100> of<00:02:41.130> but

00:02:41.979 --> 00:02:41.989 
sort of material this is made out of but

00:02:41.989 --> 00:02:46.520 
sort of material this is made out of but
the<00:02:42.989> actual<00:02:43.380> arm<00:02:44.330> this<00:02:45.330> sort<00:02:45.600> of<00:02:45.660> material<00:02:45.930> is

00:02:46.520 --> 00:02:46.530 
the actual arm this sort of material is

00:02:46.530 --> 00:02:48.440 
the actual arm this sort of material is
what<00:02:47.069> you'd<00:02:47.250> actually<00:02:47.459> ideally<00:02:48.030> want<00:02:48.239> in<00:02:48.360> a

00:02:48.440 --> 00:02:48.450 
what you'd actually ideally want in a

00:02:48.450 --> 00:02:50.240 
what you'd actually ideally want in a
trench<00:02:48.720> coat<00:02:48.810> due<00:02:49.170> to<00:02:49.290> it<00:02:49.410> being<00:02:49.440> lighter<00:02:49.920> to

00:02:50.240 --> 00:02:50.250 
trench coat due to it being lighter to

00:02:50.250 --> 00:02:53.470 
trench coat due to it being lighter to
wear<00:02:50.400> over<00:02:50.670> other<00:02:51.390> gear<00:02:51.690> and<00:02:51.930> it<00:02:52.920> being

00:02:53.470 --> 00:02:53.480 
wear over other gear and it being

00:02:53.480 --> 00:02:57.380 
wear over other gear and it being
obviously<00:02:54.480> less<00:02:55.319> maintenance<00:02:56.120> so<00:02:57.120> that's<00:02:57.300> the

00:02:57.380 --> 00:02:57.390 
obviously less maintenance so that's the

00:02:57.390 --> 00:02:58.460 
obviously less maintenance so that's the
difference<00:02:57.690> between<00:02:57.780> a<00:02:58.019> trench<00:02:58.230> coat<00:02:58.440> and

00:02:58.460 --> 00:02:58.470 
difference between a trench coat and

00:02:58.470 --> 00:03:00.259 
difference between a trench coat and
great<00:02:58.680> coat<00:02:58.920> I'll<00:02:59.100> admit<00:02:59.489> I've<00:02:59.670> used<00:03:00.120> the

00:03:00.259 --> 00:03:00.269 
great coat I'll admit I've used the

00:03:00.269 --> 00:03:02.720 
great coat I'll admit I've used the
words<00:03:00.480> interchangeably<00:03:01.290> myself<00:03:02.280> and<00:03:02.580> I'm

00:03:02.720 --> 00:03:02.730 
words interchangeably myself and I'm

00:03:02.730 --> 00:03:04.550 
words interchangeably myself and I'm
still<00:03:03.030> having<00:03:03.660> to<00:03:03.750> correct<00:03:03.870> myself<00:03:04.170> when<00:03:04.530> I

00:03:04.550 --> 00:03:04.560 
still having to correct myself when I

00:03:04.560 --> 00:03:05.870 
still having to correct myself when I
want<00:03:04.739> to<00:03:04.769> call<00:03:04.950> that<00:03:05.100> a<00:03:05.130> great<00:03:05.400> coat<00:03:05.610> on<00:03:05.790> the
