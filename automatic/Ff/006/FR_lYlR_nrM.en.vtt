contacts I do not know that I've been
using<00:02:08.610> in<00:02:08.819> landscape<00:02:09.390> actually<00:02:09.629> so<00:02:10.530> let's

00:02:10.940 --> 00:02:10.950 
using in landscape actually so let's

00:02:10.950 --> 00:02:12.140 
using in landscape actually so let's
turn<00:02:11.160> the<00:02:11.250> landscape<00:02:11.640> to<00:02:11.760> give<00:02:11.879> them<00:02:11.970> or<00:02:12.060> the

00:02:12.140 --> 00:02:12.150 
turn the landscape to give them or the

00:02:12.150 --> 00:02:13.520 
turn the landscape to give them or the
tablet<00:02:12.569> feel

00:02:13.520 --> 00:02:13.530 
tablet feel

00:02:13.530 --> 00:02:15.559 
tablet feel
so<00:02:13.740> right<00:02:13.920> here<00:02:14.130> you'll<00:02:15.000> notice<00:02:15.180> that<00:02:15.360> the

00:02:15.559 --> 00:02:15.569 
so right here you'll notice that the

00:02:15.569 --> 00:02:17.630 
so right here you'll notice that the
notification<00:02:16.200> bar<00:02:16.230> is<00:02:16.470> not<00:02:16.620> here<00:02:16.920> I<00:02:17.100> really

00:02:17.630 --> 00:02:17.640 
notification bar is not here I really

00:02:17.640 --> 00:02:19.730 
notification bar is not here I really
don't<00:02:17.880> like<00:02:18.000> that<00:02:18.300> they<00:02:18.360> took<00:02:18.630> that<00:02:18.690> out<00:02:18.840> I'd

00:02:19.730 --> 00:02:19.740 
don't like that they took that out I'd

00:02:19.740 --> 00:02:21.440 
don't like that they took that out I'd
rather<00:02:19.920> not<00:02:20.370> look<00:02:20.640> so<00:02:20.880> much<00:02:20.970> like<00:02:21.060> honeycomb

00:02:21.440 --> 00:02:21.450 
rather not look so much like honeycomb

00:02:21.450 --> 00:02:23.660 
rather not look so much like honeycomb
with<00:02:21.720> the<00:02:21.810> notification<00:02:22.440> bar<00:02:22.470> and<00:02:23.400> make<00:02:23.520> it

00:02:23.660 --> 00:02:23.670 
with the notification bar and make it

00:02:23.670 --> 00:02:25.970 
with the notification bar and make it
look<00:02:23.819> more<00:02:23.850> like<00:02:24.120> honeycomb<00:02:24.420> without<00:02:24.840> it<00:02:25.020> out

00:02:25.970 --> 00:02:25.980 
look more like honeycomb without it out

00:02:25.980 --> 00:02:28.070 
look more like honeycomb without it out
of<00:02:26.100> the<00:02:26.160> notifications<00:02:26.850> on<00:02:27.390> honeycomb<00:02:27.900> of

00:02:28.070 --> 00:02:28.080 
of the notifications on honeycomb of

00:02:28.080 --> 00:02:30.770 
of the notifications on honeycomb of
course<00:02:28.290> are<00:02:28.530> different<00:02:28.890> than<00:02:29.010> on<00:02:29.700> android<00:02:30.270> 2.2

00:02:30.770 --> 00:02:30.780 
course are different than on android 2.2

00:02:30.780 --> 00:02:32.600 
course are different than on android 2.2
so<00:02:31.200> you're<00:02:31.350> kind<00:02:31.560> of<00:02:31.680> need<00:02:31.860> the<00:02:31.980> notification

00:02:32.600 --> 00:02:32.610 
so you're kind of need the notification

00:02:32.610 --> 00:02:35.199 
so you're kind of need the notification
bar<00:02:32.640> on<00:02:33.510> anything<00:02:33.810> other<00:02:34.110> than<00:02:34.350> honeycomb<00:02:34.830> I

00:02:35.199 --> 00:02:35.209 
bar on anything other than honeycomb I

00:02:35.209 --> 00:02:37.160 
bar on anything other than honeycomb I
really<00:02:36.209> don't<00:02:36.330> like<00:02:36.480> that<00:02:36.630> they<00:02:36.690> took<00:02:36.870> it<00:02:37.050> out

00:02:37.160 --> 00:02:37.170 
really don't like that they took it out

00:02:37.170 --> 00:02:39.470 
really don't like that they took it out
but<00:02:37.440> it<00:02:37.560> I<00:02:37.739> mean<00:02:38.430> it's<00:02:38.670> not<00:02:38.850> perfect<00:02:39.360> I

00:02:39.470 --> 00:02:39.480 
but it I mean it's not perfect I

00:02:39.480 --> 00:02:40.910 
but it I mean it's not perfect I
wouldn't<00:02:40.020> recommend<00:02:40.290> this<00:02:40.500> as<00:02:40.560> a<00:02:40.680> default

00:02:40.910 --> 00:02:40.920 
wouldn't recommend this as a default

00:02:40.920 --> 00:02:44.720 
wouldn't recommend this as a default
launcher<00:02:41.250> but<00:02:43.190> it's<00:02:44.190> just<00:02:44.400> to<00:02:44.520> get<00:02:44.640> your

00:02:44.720 --> 00:02:44.730 
launcher but it's just to get your

00:02:44.730 --> 00:02:46.880 
launcher but it's just to get your
thoughts<00:02:44.910> out<00:02:45.180> there<00:02:45.209> about<00:02:45.570> in<00:02:45.959> the<00:02:46.590> future

00:02:46.880 --> 00:02:46.890 
thoughts out there about in the future

00:02:46.890 --> 00:02:48.710

it's always showing the same app so it's

00:03:03.900 --> 00:03:05.199

00:03:27.890 --> 00:03:27.900 
apps just yet I'm sure they're going to

00:03:27.900 --> 00:03:29.960

fix<00:03:28.079> that<00:03:28.260> in<00:03:28.440> the<00:03:28.560> future<00:03:28.709> with<00:03:29.579> the<00:03:29.670> built<00:03:29.850> in

00:03:29.960 --> 00:03:29.970 
fix that in the future with the built in

00:03:29.970 --> 00:03:33.229 
fix that in the future with the built in
task<00:03:30.150> manager<00:03:30.360> or<00:03:30.780> something<00:03:31.010> yeah<00:03:32.010> and<00:03:32.400> then

00:03:33.229 --> 00:03:33.239 
task manager or something yeah and then

00:03:33.239 --> 00:03:36.440 
task manager or something yeah and then
of<00:03:33.390> course<00:03:33.600> you<00:03:33.780> hit<00:03:33.900> your<00:03:33.989> app<00:03:34.110> drawer<00:03:35.450> right

00:03:36.440 --> 00:03:36.450 
of course you hit your app drawer right

00:03:36.450 --> 00:03:40.009 
of course you hit your app drawer right
there<00:03:36.480> and<00:03:36.959> then<00:03:37.680> go<00:03:37.890> down<00:03:38.630> go<00:03:39.630> up<00:03:39.810> it<00:03:39.959> doesn't
