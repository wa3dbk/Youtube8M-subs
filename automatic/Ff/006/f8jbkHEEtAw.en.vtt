00:00:57.770 --> 00:00:57.780 
gliding along this bar on the right side

00:00:57.780 --> 00:01:01.420 
gliding along this bar on the right side
it<00:00:58.500> look<00:00:58.680> pretty<00:00:58.980> glitchy<00:00:59.309> but<00:00:59.879> it'll<00:01:00.000> work

00:01:01.420 --> 00:01:01.430 
it look pretty glitchy but it'll work

00:01:01.430 --> 00:01:04.670 
it look pretty glitchy but it'll work
and<00:01:02.430> this<00:01:02.520> can<00:01:02.730> be<00:01:02.820> difficult<00:01:03.000> to<00:01:03.480> now<00:01:04.439> get<00:01:04.559> on

00:01:04.670 --> 00:01:04.680 
and this can be difficult to now get on

00:01:04.680 --> 00:01:06.740 
and this can be difficult to now get on
to<00:01:04.830> this<00:01:04.920> orange<00:01:05.280> tarp<00:01:05.580> basically<00:01:06.570> what

00:01:06.740 --> 00:01:06.750 
to this orange tarp basically what

00:01:10.010 --> 00:01:10.020 
this tree and jump into its first branch

00:01:10.020 --> 00:01:12.950 
this tree and jump into its first branch
and<00:01:10.520> then<00:01:11.520> immediately<00:01:11.850> after<00:01:12.240> lightly<00:01:12.750> jump

and then immediately after lightly jump
into<00:01:13.080> its<00:01:13.290> second<00:01:13.590> branch<00:01:13.770> and<00:01:14.010> get<00:01:14.250> onto<00:01:14.490> this

00:01:14.600 --> 00:01:14.610 
into its second branch and get onto this

00:01:14.610 --> 00:01:16.850 
into its second branch and get onto this
Bend<00:01:14.880> I'm<00:01:15.060> standing<00:01:15.390> on<00:01:15.509> right<00:01:15.720> here<00:01:16.049> then
