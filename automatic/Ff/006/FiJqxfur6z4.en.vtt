00:00:00.050 --> 00:00:03.570
 hello guys as always with you 

00:00:02.760 --> 00:00:05.790
 us to 

00:00:03.570 --> 00:00:08.880
 there is an opinion that low 

00:00:05.790 --> 00:00:12.150
 dota 2 priority can be removed by removing it 

00:00:08.880 --> 00:00:15.269
 and perry setting and low priority should 

00:00:12.150 --> 00:00:18.000
 in the maw but you shouldn't 

00:00:15.269 --> 00:00:20.010
 read the message that comes here 

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:23.880
 here I think the cursor is visible and you 

00:00:20.010 --> 00:00:27.359
 see where i'm showing how you can 

00:00:23.880 --> 00:00:29.640
 notice the whole priority I was given 5 

00:00:27.359 --> 00:00:31.920
 games for what let's see also 

00:00:29.640 --> 00:00:37.469
 I'll show you need 

00:00:31.920 --> 00:00:39.540
 my mr is 4330 2 units of low 

00:00:37.469 --> 00:00:42.660
 priority was given in the game 

00:00:39.540 --> 00:00:47.370
 where I played with weight let's see 

00:00:42.660 --> 00:00:51.899
 probably seen here as godless devil 

00:00:47.370 --> 00:00:56.100
 but no, I have n't seen 15 kilos of 70 

00:00:51.899 --> 00:01:00.410
 world of those and I have 28 assists 15 kilos this 

00:00:56.100 --> 00:01:03.270
 the highest number of kills 

00:01:00.410 --> 00:01:06.180
 was made into a single player game 

00:01:03.270 --> 00:01:07.979
 accordingly, more simply, I am more 

00:01:06.180 --> 00:01:10.530
 all on keel diamond som do it 

00:01:07.979 --> 00:01:13.350
 it is not difficult but nevertheless I have the most 

00:01:10.530 --> 00:01:15.240
 small number of deaths like you 

00:01:13.350 --> 00:01:17.610
 you can see the biggest 

00:01:15.240 --> 00:01:19.710
 the number of assists from all ten 

00:01:17.610 --> 00:01:23.549
 the players who took part in me 

00:01:19.710 --> 00:01:28.759
 the best indicator I played better 

00:01:23.549 --> 00:01:32.360
 all the most useful of all of these here 

00:01:28.759 --> 00:01:35.570
 characters but nonetheless I was given 

00:01:32.360 --> 00:01:39.299
 report to report 

00:01:35.570 --> 00:01:41.040
 I do not know what for but 

00:01:39.299 --> 00:01:45.270
 I did not like the enemy yet 

00:01:41.040 --> 00:01:48.439
 than in general now how do I do 

00:01:45.270 --> 00:01:52.079
 record will pause 

00:01:48.439 --> 00:01:53.340
 I will reinstall dota and show you what 

00:01:52.079 --> 00:01:58.890
 will turn out 

00:01:53.340 --> 00:02:01.960
 lp goals with them or not take a look 

00:01:58.890 --> 00:02:06.460
 so guys , I basically did everything 

00:02:01.960 --> 00:02:09.880
 mean what were my actions i deleted 

00:02:06.460 --> 00:02:14.500
 dota deleted steam downloaded new steam 

00:02:09.880 --> 00:02:17.070
 installed steam launched steam installed 

00:02:14.500 --> 00:02:20.560
 dota came tuned sound 

00:02:17.070 --> 00:02:22.780
 to hear me but the results 

00:02:20.560 --> 00:02:25.780
 removed or not removed lp 

00:02:22.780 --> 00:02:29.709
 I have not seen there as soon as I 

00:02:25.780 --> 00:02:32.920
 went in there showing us a shop or 

00:02:29.709 --> 00:02:35.290
 what is shown there in general is not there 

00:02:32.920 --> 00:02:38.500
 seen by you or not I immediately 

00:02:35.290 --> 00:02:41.590
 went through the settings and made the sound mean i 

00:02:38.500 --> 00:02:48.520
 I think that they took off, but let's see 

00:02:41.590 --> 00:02:51.540
 I will not weary Douglas and fuck like 

00:02:48.520 --> 00:02:56.739
 I guess I know all the actions 

00:02:51.540 --> 00:02:58.900
 correct since I read quite a lot 

00:02:56.739 --> 00:03:01.360
 on the internet about what we can do 

00:02:58.900 --> 00:03:07.720
 beat down or could it be whipped 

00:03:01.360 --> 00:03:11.580
 but you see everything yourself as if I were this 

00:03:07.720 --> 00:03:15.269
 crap didn't read on you were moved here 

00:03:11.580 --> 00:03:19.380
 do as it is written but nonetheless 

00:03:15.269 --> 00:03:19.380
 lp-5 games remain as it was 

00:03:20.220 --> 00:03:26.350
 myth dispelled so let's say but there is of course 

00:03:23.049 --> 00:03:30.269
 the same small plus in all this is a plus 

00:03:26.350 --> 00:03:34.450
 is that you being 

00:03:30.269 --> 00:03:36.549
 aware of such a withdrawal lp will not 

00:03:34.450 --> 00:03:39.549
 waste your time on it and you will already 

00:03:36.549 --> 00:03:42.519
 know the result of this method that this 

00:03:39.549 --> 00:03:43.810
 The method is not working, in principle, all the guys 

00:03:42.519 --> 00:03:50.799
 thanks for watching 

00:03:43.810 --> 00:03:52.239
 and I want to add that I will release a video about 

00:03:50.799 --> 00:03:57.690
 how to shoot 

00:03:52.239 --> 00:04:00.650
 lp probably tomorrow through money 

00:03:57.690 --> 00:04:04.620
 how will I do this show and 

00:04:00.650 --> 00:04:06.540
 I will tell and then and in general I think that 

00:04:04.620 --> 00:04:08.610
 it will be interesting enough that is 

00:04:06.540 --> 00:04:10.890
 we will play but I will show how we will 

00:04:08.610 --> 00:04:12.900
 play and what we will do if i have 

00:04:10.890 --> 00:04:15.120
 everything will turn out of course that I 

00:04:12.900 --> 00:04:18.180
 conceived here all the guys thanks for 

00:04:15.120 --> 00:04:22.230
 view like the likes 

00:04:18.180 --> 00:04:24.270
 at least what you already know what it is 

00:04:22.230 --> 00:04:26.700

00:04:24.270 --> 00:04:28.560
