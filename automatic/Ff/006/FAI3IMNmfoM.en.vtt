00:02:56.160 --> 00:02:56.170 
threading the water guy but the thing is

00:02:56.170 --> 00:03:00.059 
threading the water guy but the thing is
like<00:02:57.870> most<00:02:58.870> decks<00:02:59.170> now<00:02:59.379> just<00:02:59.620> have<00:02:59.769> very

00:03:00.059 --> 00:03:00.069 
like most decks now just have very

00:03:00.069 --> 00:03:02.339 
like most decks now just have very
well-rounded<00:03:00.459> matchup<00:03:01.030> against<00:03:01.420> it<00:03:01.569> I<00:03:01.780> mean

00:03:02.339 --> 00:03:02.349 
well-rounded matchup against it I mean

00:03:02.349 --> 00:03:03.930 
well-rounded matchup against it I mean
water<00:03:02.680> is<00:03:02.890> probably<00:03:03.069> just<00:03:03.400> going<00:03:03.489> to<00:03:03.579> pull<00:03:03.790> you

00:03:03.930 --> 00:03:03.940 
water is probably just going to pull you

00:03:03.940 --> 00:03:06.960 
water is probably just going to pull you
out<00:03:04.090> as<00:03:04.239> hard<00:03:04.450> as<00:03:04.690> you<00:03:05.349> know<00:03:05.470> sure<00:03:05.650> dolls<00:03:05.970> but

00:03:06.960 --> 00:03:06.970 
out as hard as you know sure dolls but

00:03:06.970 --> 00:03:09.360 
out as hard as you know sure dolls but
it's<00:03:07.659> one<00:03:07.900> of<00:03:07.989> those<00:03:08.079> things<00:03:08.140> that<00:03:08.500> you<00:03:08.890> know<00:03:09.099> I

00:03:09.360 --> 00:03:09.370 
it's one of those things that you know I

00:03:09.370 --> 00:03:11.069 
it's one of those things that you know I
really<00:03:09.819> do<00:03:10.090> like<00:03:10.239> the<00:03:10.450> concept<00:03:10.750> behind<00:03:10.840> the

00:03:11.069 --> 00:03:11.079 
really do like the concept behind the

00:03:11.079 --> 00:03:13.979 
really do like the concept behind the
deck<00:03:11.230> arm<00:03:11.790> you<00:03:12.790> like<00:03:13.120> I<00:03:13.150> said<00:03:13.390> you<00:03:13.750> would<00:03:13.870> think

00:03:13.979 --> 00:03:13.989 
deck arm you like I said you would think

00:03:13.989 --> 00:03:17.759 
deck arm you like I said you would think
that<00:03:14.140> floaters<00:03:15.040> would<00:03:15.700> make<00:03:15.879> a<00:03:16.090> deck<00:03:16.359> good<00:03:16.900> but

00:03:17.759 --> 00:03:17.769 
that floaters would make a deck good but

00:03:17.769 --> 00:03:21.000 
that floaters would make a deck good but
it<00:03:17.859> doesn't<00:03:18.190> and<00:03:18.340> they<00:03:18.880> also<00:03:19.000> miss<00:03:19.329> timing<00:03:20.010> if

00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:21.010 
it doesn't and they also miss timing if

00:03:21.010 --> 00:03:23.789 
it doesn't and they also miss timing if
you<00:03:21.130> go<00:03:21.280> to<00:03:21.459> changing<00:03:21.849> three<00:03:22.239> and<00:03:22.799> you

00:03:23.789 --> 00:03:23.799 
you go to changing three and you

00:03:23.799 --> 00:03:26.759 
you go to changing three and you
activate<00:03:24.190> earn<00:03:24.340> from<00:03:24.519> tribute<00:03:24.849> and<00:03:25.590> I<00:03:26.590> have

00:03:26.759 --> 00:03:26.769 
activate earn from tribute and I have

00:03:26.769 --> 00:03:28.860 
activate earn from tribute and I have

two<00:03:29.400> your<00:03:30.400> guys<00:03:30.639> not<00:03:30.910> going<00:03:31.090> to<00:03:31.209> resolve

00:03:31.559 --> 00:03:31.569 
two your guys not going to resolve

00:03:31.569 --> 00:03:34.770 
two your guys not going to resolve
because<00:03:32.019> chain<00:03:32.470> links<00:03:32.739> 1<00:03:32.980> and<00:03:33.220> 2<00:03:33.700> still<00:03:34.599> have

00:03:34.770 --> 00:03:34.780 
because chain links 1 and 2 still have

00:03:34.780 --> 00:03:38.610 
because chain links 1 and 2 still have
to<00:03:34.930> resolve<00:03:35.519> not<00:03:36.519> your<00:03:37.239> guy<00:03:37.389> attempting<00:03:38.260> mid

00:03:42.170 --> 00:03:42.180 
resolve mid chain because my dragon and

00:03:42.180 --> 00:03:46.020 
resolve mid chain because my dragon and
my<00:03:43.180> beast<00:03:43.720> still<00:03:44.410> have<00:03:44.560> to<00:03:44.709> resolve<00:03:45.040> so<00:03:45.970> if

00:03:46.020 --> 00:03:46.030 
my beast still have to resolve so if

you're torrential chain link 3 your guy
is<00:03:48.519> going<00:03:48.790> to<00:03:48.910> have<00:03:49.120> a<00:03:49.150> bad<00:03:49.419> time<00:03:49.449> I'm<00:03:50.019> just

00:03:50.550 --> 00:03:50.560 
is going to have a bad time I'm just

00:03:50.560 --> 00:03:54.030 
is going to have a bad time I'm just
saying<00:03:50.859> so<00:03:52.260> it's<00:03:53.260> also<00:03:53.440> one<00:03:53.650> of<00:03:53.680> the<00:03:53.769> problems

00:03:54.030 --> 00:03:54.040 
saying so it's also one of the problems

00:03:54.040 --> 00:03:55.710 
saying so it's also one of the problems
they<00:03:54.609> made<00:03:54.760> it<00:03:54.849> really<00:03:55.000> hard<00:03:55.120> for<00:03:55.329> sure<00:03:55.569> dolls

they made it really hard for sure dolls
to<00:03:56.470> miss<00:03:56.980> timing<00:03:57.310> and<00:03:58.019> I<00:03:59.019> don't<00:03:59.319> even<00:03:59.379> think

00:03:59.520 --> 00:03:59.530 
to miss timing and I don't even think

00:03:59.530 --> 00:04:02.720 
to miss timing and I don't even think
they<00:04:00.310> can<00:04:00.609> that's<00:04:00.849> coming<00:04:01.150> that's<00:04:01.480> bad<00:04:01.750> like

00:04:02.720 --> 00:04:02.730

what<00:04:31.150> you<00:04:31.240> can<00:04:31.360> do<00:04:31.480> so<00:04:31.720> just<00:04:32.230> remember<00:04:32.410> the

00:04:32.820 --> 00:04:32.830 
what you can do so just remember the

00:04:32.830 --> 00:04:34.770 
what you can do so just remember the
deck<00:04:33.310> is<00:04:33.460> very<00:04:33.700> easy<00:04:33.820> to<00:04:33.940> break<00:04:34.180> that's<00:04:34.540> my

00:04:34.770 --> 00:04:34.780 
deck is very easy to break that's my

00:04:34.780 --> 00:04:37.500 
deck is very easy to break that's my
only<00:04:34.990> major<00:04:35.200> concern<00:04:36.060> maybe<00:04:37.060> in<00:04:37.270> the<00:04:37.390> future

00:04:37.500 --> 00:04:37.510

better<00:04:38.950> they<00:04:39.700> need<00:04:39.880> a<00:04:39.910> lot<00:04:40.240> more<00:04:40.270> support

00:04:40.800 --> 00:04:40.810 
better they need a lot more support
