then shall we said solve the first one

00:00:43.260 --> 00:00:45.049 
then shall we said solve the first one
here<00:00:43.500> which<00:00:43.649> was<00:00:43.800> a<00:00:43.829> feature<00:00:44.100> that<00:00:44.219> was<00:00:44.579> in<00:00:44.850> the

00:00:45.049 --> 00:00:45.059 
here which was a feature that was in the

00:00:45.059 --> 00:00:46.790 
here which was a feature that was in the
game<00:00:45.300> for<00:00:45.600> if<00:00:45.719> you<00:00:45.870> update<00:00:46.050> at<00:00:46.260> what<00:00:46.379> point<00:00:46.649> and

00:00:46.790 --> 00:00:46.800 
game for if you update at what point and

00:00:46.800 --> 00:00:48.799 
game for if you update at what point and
that<00:00:47.129> is<00:00:47.280> dirt<00:00:47.579> slabs<00:00:48.000> so<00:00:48.210> these<00:00:48.480> are<00:00:48.629> one<00:00:48.750> of

00:00:48.799 --> 00:00:48.809 
that is dirt slabs so these are one of

00:00:48.809 --> 00:00:50.270 
that is dirt slabs so these are one of
the<00:00:48.870> most<00:00:48.960> likely<00:00:49.320> features<00:00:49.770> because<00:00:50.070> they're

00:00:50.270 --> 00:00:50.280 
the most likely features because they're

00:00:50.280 --> 00:00:52.250 
the most likely features because they're
so<00:00:50.520> easy<00:00:50.789> to<00:00:50.940> put<00:00:51.120> in<00:00:51.210> the<00:00:51.329> game<00:00:51.570> you<00:00:52.110> know<00:00:52.230> a

00:00:52.250 --> 00:00:52.260 
so easy to put in the game you know a

00:00:52.260 --> 00:00:53.840 
so easy to put in the game you know a
dirt<00:00:52.500> slab<00:00:52.739> is<00:00:52.890> of<00:00:53.010> course<00:00:53.219> just<00:00:53.250> a<00:00:53.460> half<00:00:53.640> slab

00:00:53.840 --> 00:00:53.850 
dirt slab is of course just a half slab

00:00:53.850 --> 00:00:55.279 
dirt slab is of course just a half slab
made<00:00:54.090> out<00:00:54.210> of<00:00:54.300> dirt<00:00:54.510> and<00:00:54.690> it<00:00:54.930> kind<00:00:55.110> of<00:00:55.140> makes

00:00:55.279 --> 00:00:55.289 
made out of dirt and it kind of makes

00:00:55.289 --> 00:00:56.479 
made out of dirt and it kind of makes
sense<00:00:55.469> when<00:00:55.680> you<00:00:55.710> think<00:00:55.920> about<00:00:55.980> it<00:00:56.250> because

00:00:56.479 --> 00:00:56.489 
sense when you think about it because

00:00:56.489 --> 00:00:57.889 
sense when you think about it because
you<00:00:56.579> can<00:00:56.730> use<00:00:56.910> it<00:00:57.059> to<00:00:57.180> make<00:00:57.300> more<00:00:57.539> natural

00:00:57.889 --> 00:00:57.899 
you can use it to make more natural

00:00:57.899 --> 00:00:59.630 
you can use it to make more natural
terrain<00:00:58.050> and<00:00:58.410> that<00:00:58.680> was<00:00:58.800> the<00:00:58.890> idea<00:00:59.160> behind<00:00:59.309> him

00:00:59.630 --> 00:00:59.640 
terrain and that was the idea behind him

00:00:59.640 --> 00:01:01.099 
terrain and that was the idea behind him
milling<00:00:59.850> in<00:00:59.940> the<00:01:00.030> game<00:01:00.210> however<00:01:00.449> because<00:01:00.989> he

00:01:01.099 --> 00:01:01.109 
milling in the game however because he

00:01:01.109 --> 00:01:02.389 
milling in the game however because he
tried<00:01:01.440> to<00:01:01.469> put<00:01:01.620> it<00:01:01.680> in<00:01:01.739> the<00:01:01.800> terrain<00:01:02.039> generator

00:01:02.389 --> 00:01:02.399 
tried to put it in the terrain generator

00:01:02.399 --> 00:01:04.280 
tried to put it in the terrain generator
it<00:01:02.699> made<00:01:03.030> stuff<00:01:03.300> like<00:01:03.510> this<00:01:03.750> happen<00:01:04.110> and<00:01:04.229> as

00:01:04.280 --> 00:01:04.290 
it made stuff like this happen and as

00:01:04.290 --> 00:01:06.020 
it made stuff like this happen and as
you<00:01:04.379> can<00:01:04.470> see<00:01:04.650> this<00:01:04.799> looks<00:01:05.010> much<00:01:05.309> less<00:01:05.549> natural

00:01:06.020 --> 00:01:06.030 
you can see this looks much less natural

00:01:06.030 --> 00:01:07.130 
you can see this looks much less natural
than<00:01:06.150> just<00:01:06.299> having<00:01:06.479> dirt<00:01:06.750> block<00:01:06.960> and

00:01:07.130 --> 00:01:07.140 
than just having dirt block and

00:01:07.140 --> 00:01:08.990 
than just having dirt block and
apparently<00:01:07.950> it<00:01:08.070> must<00:01:08.220> just<00:01:08.369> really<00:01:08.760> annoyed

00:01:08.990 --> 00:01:09.000 
apparently it must just really annoyed

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:10.280 
apparently it must just really annoyed
him<00:01:09.090> because<00:01:09.270> he<00:01:09.360> just<00:01:09.479> removed<00:01:09.840> at<00:01:09.960> the<00:01:10.049> next

00:01:10.280 --> 00:01:10.290 
him because he just removed at the next

00:01:10.290 --> 00:01:12.170 
him because he just removed at the next
update<00:01:10.380> and<00:01:10.770> it<00:01:10.860> hasn't<00:01:11.280> been<00:01:11.400> seen<00:01:11.700> since

00:01:12.170 --> 00:01:12.180 
update and it hasn't been seen since

00:01:12.180 --> 00:01:13.760 
update and it hasn't been seen since
however<00:01:12.630> since<00:01:12.869> notch<00:01:13.140> had<00:01:13.380> stopped<00:01:13.619> working

00:01:13.760 --> 00:01:13.770 
however since notch had stopped working

00:01:13.770 --> 00:01:15.620 
however since notch had stopped working
for<00:01:14.159> a<00:01:14.189> really<00:01:14.369> long<00:01:14.549> time<00:01:14.610> whenever<00:01:15.420> there's

00:01:15.620 --> 00:01:15.630 
for a really long time whenever there's

00:01:15.630 --> 00:01:17.179 
for a really long time whenever there's
a<00:01:15.750> update<00:01:16.140> where<00:01:16.320> this<00:01:16.409> formatic<00:01:16.770> leaf<00:01:16.979> it's

00:01:17.179 --> 00:01:17.189 
a update where this formatic leaf it's

00:01:17.189 --> 00:01:18.380 
a update where this formatic leaf it's
so<00:01:17.400> let's<00:01:17.580> say<00:01:17.729> there's<00:01:17.939> one<00:01:18.030> where<00:01:18.150> they<00:01:18.240> want

00:01:18.380 --> 00:01:18.390 
so let's say there's one where they want

00:01:18.390 --> 00:01:19.490 
so let's say there's one where they want
to<00:01:18.450> improve<00:01:18.659> the<00:01:18.840> terrain<00:01:19.049> generator

00:01:19.490 --> 00:01:19.500 
to improve the terrain generator

00:01:19.500 --> 00:01:21.440 
to improve the terrain generator
I<00:01:19.619> think<00:01:19.979> dirt<00:01:20.220> and<00:01:20.430> grass<00:01:20.700> half<00:01:20.970> slabs<00:01:21.270> are

00:01:21.440 --> 00:01:21.450 
I think dirt and grass half slabs are

00:01:21.450 --> 00:01:22.700 
I think dirt and grass half slabs are
just<00:01:21.600> one<00:01:21.689> of<00:01:21.780> those<00:01:21.900> ideas<00:01:22.110> that<00:01:22.350> make<00:01:22.590> a

00:01:22.700 --> 00:01:22.710 
just one of those ideas that make a

00:01:22.710 --> 00:01:25.039 
just one of those ideas that make a
bunch<00:01:23.040> of<00:01:23.189> sense<00:01:23.580> so<00:01:23.880> yeah<00:01:24.299> dirt<00:01:24.540> dirt<00:01:24.780> slabs

00:01:25.039 --> 00:01:25.049 
bunch of sense so yeah dirt dirt slabs

00:01:25.049 --> 00:01:26.690 
bunch of sense so yeah dirt dirt slabs
were<00:01:25.259> removed<00:01:25.680> but<00:01:25.890> you<00:01:26.040> know<00:01:26.159> they<00:01:26.340> said<00:01:26.580> they

00:01:26.690 --> 00:01:26.700 
were removed but you know they said they

00:01:26.700 --> 00:01:27.980 
were removed but you know they said they
were<00:01:26.790> coming<00:01:26.820> back<00:01:27.030> at<00:01:27.330> some<00:01:27.540> point<00:01:27.570> they

00:01:27.980 --> 00:01:27.990 
were coming back at some point they

00:01:27.990 --> 00:01:29.899 
were coming back at some point they
never<00:01:28.200> did<00:01:28.409> but<00:01:28.590> now<00:01:28.890> you<00:01:29.280> know<00:01:29.400> the<00:01:29.520> chance<00:01:29.759> is

00:01:29.899 --> 00:01:29.909 
never did but now you know the chance is

00:01:29.909 --> 00:01:31.429 
never did but now you know the chance is
higher<00:01:30.119> than<00:01:30.299> ever<00:01:30.540> so<00:01:30.810> yeah<00:01:30.960> that's<00:01:31.170> the<00:01:31.259> dirt

00:01:31.429 --> 00:01:31.439 
higher than ever so yeah that's the dirt

00:01:31.439 --> 00:01:33.109 
higher than ever so yeah that's the dirt
slab<00:01:31.680> great<00:01:32.189> one<00:01:32.310> for<00:01:32.400> you<00:01:32.490> builders<00:01:32.820> what

00:01:33.109 --> 00:01:33.119 
slab great one for you builders what

00:01:33.119 --> 00:01:34.429 
slab great one for you builders what
about<00:01:33.270> features<00:01:33.479> for<00:01:33.810> people<00:01:34.079> who<00:01:34.200> aren't

00:01:34.429 --> 00:01:34.439 
about features for people who aren't

00:01:34.439 --> 00:01:36.410 
about features for people who aren't
builders<00:01:34.890> so<00:01:35.189> the<00:01:35.369> second<00:01:35.759> feature<00:01:35.909> had<00:01:36.210> a<00:01:36.240> lot

00:01:36.410 --> 00:01:36.420 
builders so the second feature had a lot

00:01:36.420 --> 00:01:37.850 
builders so the second feature had a lot
of<00:01:36.509> controversy<00:01:36.869> because<00:01:37.409> of<00:01:37.530> the<00:01:37.590> way<00:01:37.710> it<00:01:37.770> was

00:01:37.850 --> 00:01:37.860 
of controversy because of the way it was

00:01:37.860 --> 00:01:39.350 
of controversy because of the way it was
gonna<00:01:37.979> be<00:01:38.100> implemented<00:01:38.579> but<00:01:38.670> it's<00:01:38.850> not<00:01:39.030> a<00:01:39.060> bad

00:01:39.350 --> 00:01:39.360 
gonna be implemented but it's not a bad

00:01:39.360 --> 00:01:41.480 
gonna be implemented but it's not a bad
idea<00:01:39.390> by<00:01:39.960> itself<00:01:40.259> and<00:01:40.470> that<00:01:40.560> is<00:01:40.710> the<00:01:40.920> lantern

00:01:41.480 --> 00:01:41.490 
idea by itself and that is the lantern

00:01:41.490 --> 00:01:43.520 
idea by itself and that is the lantern
so<00:01:41.820> not<00:01:42.240> originally<00:01:42.780> specified<00:01:43.020> it<00:01:43.320> was<00:01:43.409> gonna

00:01:43.520 --> 00:01:43.530 
so not originally specified it was gonna

00:01:43.530 --> 00:01:45.200 
so not originally specified it was gonna
be<00:01:43.619> one<00:01:43.740> of<00:01:43.770> the<00:01:43.860> first<00:01:44.130> Halloween<00:01:44.579> updates

00:01:45.200 --> 00:01:45.210 
be one of the first Halloween updates

00:01:45.210 --> 00:01:46.999 
be one of the first Halloween updates
and<00:01:45.390> you<00:01:45.960> know<00:01:46.049> it<00:01:46.200> got<00:01:46.320> delayed<00:01:46.590> a<00:01:46.649> little<00:01:46.799> bit

00:01:46.999 --> 00:01:47.009 
and you know it got delayed a little bit

00:01:47.009 --> 00:01:48.200 
and you know it got delayed a little bit
and<00:01:47.189> they'd<00:01:47.340> make<00:01:47.520> it<00:01:47.610> in<00:01:47.700> the<00:01:47.790> first<00:01:47.970> update

00:01:48.200 --> 00:01:48.210 
and they'd make it in the first update

00:01:48.210 --> 00:01:49.940 
and they'd make it in the first update
but<00:01:48.630> the<00:01:48.720> idea<00:01:49.079> behind<00:01:49.259> them<00:01:49.590> was<00:01:49.799> that

00:01:49.940 --> 00:01:49.950 
but the idea behind them was that

00:01:49.950 --> 00:01:51.679 
but the idea behind them was that
torches<00:01:50.460> would<00:01:50.640> eventually<00:01:50.970> have<00:01:51.420> to<00:01:51.450> you

00:01:51.679 --> 00:01:51.689 
torches would eventually have to you

00:01:51.689 --> 00:01:52.760 
torches would eventually have to you
know<00:01:51.780> go<00:01:52.020> out<00:01:52.049> and<00:01:52.170> you<00:01:52.409> have<00:01:52.470> to<00:01:52.619> keep

00:01:52.760 --> 00:01:52.770 
know go out and you have to keep

00:01:52.770 --> 00:01:54.679 
know go out and you have to keep
relighting<00:01:53.280> torches<00:01:53.640> and<00:01:53.729> lanterns<00:01:53.790> would<00:01:54.540> be

00:01:54.679 --> 00:01:54.689 
relighting torches and lanterns would be

00:01:54.689 --> 00:01:56.389 
relighting torches and lanterns would be
the<00:01:54.840> only<00:01:55.020> permanent<00:01:55.500> light<00:01:55.829> source<00:01:56.159> and<00:01:56.369> you

00:01:56.389 --> 00:01:56.399 
the only permanent light source and you

00:01:56.399 --> 00:01:57.830 
the only permanent light source and you
know<00:01:56.729> it<00:01:56.850> sounds<00:01:57.090> really<00:01:57.270> cool<00:01:57.420> to<00:01:57.540> introduce

00:01:57.830 --> 00:01:57.840 
know it sounds really cool to introduce

00:01:57.840 --> 00:01:59.450 
know it sounds really cool to introduce
a<00:01:57.960> new<00:01:58.079> block<00:01:58.350> that's<00:01:58.590> permanent<00:01:59.130> but<00:01:59.280> when

00:01:59.450 --> 00:01:59.460 
a new block that's permanent but when

00:01:59.460 --> 00:02:01.490 
a new block that's permanent but when
the<00:01:59.670> existing<00:02:00.180> block<00:02:00.390> is<00:02:00.600> permanent<00:02:01.200> already

00:02:01.490 --> 00:02:01.500 
the existing block is permanent already

00:02:01.500 --> 00:02:03.260 
the existing block is permanent already
and<00:02:01.710> you<00:02:02.070> know<00:02:02.189> the<00:02:02.369> old<00:02:02.579> one<00:02:02.790> is<00:02:02.939> one<00:02:03.119> that

00:02:03.260 --> 00:02:03.270 
and you know the old one is one that

00:02:03.270 --> 00:02:04.789 
and you know the old one is one that
people<00:02:03.479> like<00:02:03.630> it<00:02:04.110> causes<00:02:04.350> a<00:02:04.380> lot<00:02:04.469> of<00:02:04.530> people<00:02:04.649> to

00:02:04.789 --> 00:02:04.799 
people like it causes a lot of people to

00:02:04.799 --> 00:02:06.469 
people like it causes a lot of people to
be<00:02:04.860> really<00:02:05.159> upset<00:02:05.460> with<00:02:05.549> it<00:02:05.700> so<00:02:05.880> not<00:02:06.060> said<00:02:06.360> that

00:02:06.469 --> 00:02:06.479 
be really upset with it so not said that

00:02:06.479 --> 00:02:07.459 
be really upset with it so not said that
they<00:02:06.570> were<00:02:06.630> going<00:02:06.780> to<00:02:06.840> be<00:02:06.899> postponed<00:02:07.350> because

00:02:07.459 --> 00:02:07.469 
they were going to be postponed because

00:02:07.469 --> 00:02:09.139 
they were going to be postponed because
of<00:02:07.740> the<00:02:07.890> fact<00:02:08.129> that<00:02:08.310> you<00:02:08.550> know<00:02:08.670> everyone

00:02:09.139 --> 00:02:09.149 
of the fact that you know everyone

00:02:09.149 --> 00:02:10.820 
of the fact that you know everyone
really<00:02:09.660> hated<00:02:09.959> the<00:02:10.050> idea<00:02:10.140> of<00:02:10.289> the<00:02:10.410> changes<00:02:10.709> for

00:02:10.820 --> 00:02:10.830 
really hated the idea of the changes for

00:02:10.830 --> 00:02:12.410 
really hated the idea of the changes for
the<00:02:10.890> torches<00:02:11.280> and<00:02:11.370> to<00:02:11.700> be<00:02:11.760> fair<00:02:11.970> I<00:02:12.090> don't<00:02:12.209> think

00:02:12.410 --> 00:02:12.420 
the torches and to be fair I don't think

00:02:12.420 --> 00:02:13.430 
the torches and to be fair I don't think
they<00:02:12.569> should<00:02:12.599> ever<00:02:12.900> do<00:02:13.170> that

00:02:13.430 --> 00:02:13.440 
they should ever do that

00:02:13.440 --> 00:02:14.660 
they should ever do that
they<00:02:13.530> make<00:02:13.680> torches<00:02:13.980> have<00:02:14.220> to<00:02:14.310> be<00:02:14.400> real<00:02:14.580> it

00:02:14.660 --> 00:02:14.670 
they make torches have to be real it

00:02:14.670 --> 00:02:16.190 
they make torches have to be real it
flint<00:02:14.940> and<00:02:15.060> steel<00:02:15.090> every<00:02:15.540> like<00:02:15.690> ten<00:02:15.900> minutes

00:02:16.190 --> 00:02:16.200 
flint and steel every like ten minutes

00:02:16.200 --> 00:02:18.020 
flint and steel every like ten minutes

00:02:18.020 --> 00:02:18.030 
that's awful I want to light up places

00:02:18.030 --> 00:02:19.580 
that's awful I want to light up places

00:02:21.750 --> 00:02:23.540 
what you know the key part is I did the
lantern<00:02:22.110> can<00:02:22.380> come<00:02:22.620> back<00:02:22.830> just<00:02:23.040> cuz<00:02:23.220> its<00:02:23.370> new

00:02:23.540 --> 00:02:23.550 
lantern can come back just cuz its new

00:02:23.550 --> 00:02:25.460 
lantern can come back just cuz its new
mix<00:02:24.120> of<00:02:24.270> this<00:02:24.420> question<00:02:24.750> will<00:02:24.840> history<00:02:25.170> the

00:02:25.460 --> 00:02:25.470 
mix of this question will history the

00:02:25.470 --> 00:02:26.690 
mix of this question will history the
lantern<00:02:25.800> is<00:02:25.920> such<00:02:26.100> a<00:02:26.130> good<00:02:26.310> idea<00:02:26.550> because

00:02:26.690 --> 00:02:26.700 
lantern is such a good idea because

00:02:26.700 --> 00:02:28.490 
lantern is such a good idea because
right<00:02:27.060> now<00:02:27.240> we<00:02:27.300> have<00:02:27.450> three<00:02:27.960> major<00:02:28.200> light

00:02:28.490 --> 00:02:28.500 
right now we have three major light

00:02:28.500 --> 00:02:29.830 
right now we have three major light
sources<00:02:28.830> we<00:02:29.010> have<00:02:29.190> you<00:02:29.490> know<00:02:29.610> the

00:02:29.830 --> 00:02:29.840 
sources we have you know the

00:02:29.840 --> 00:02:31.940 
sources we have you know the
jack-o'-lantern<00:02:30.870> we<00:02:31.140> have<00:02:31.290> glowstone<00:02:31.680> and<00:02:31.890> we

00:02:31.940 --> 00:02:31.950 
jack-o'-lantern we have glowstone and we

00:02:31.950 --> 00:02:33.740 
jack-o'-lantern we have glowstone and we
have<00:02:32.040> torches<00:02:32.400> and<00:02:32.520> although<00:02:32.970> glowstone<00:02:33.540> is

00:02:33.740 --> 00:02:33.750 
have torches and although glowstone is

00:02:33.750 --> 00:02:35.030 
have torches and although glowstone is
used<00:02:34.020> where<00:02:34.170> most<00:02:34.380> people<00:02:34.440> would<00:02:34.830> use<00:02:34.860> a

00:02:35.030 --> 00:02:35.040 
used where most people would use a

00:02:35.040 --> 00:02:36.740 
used where most people would use a
lantern<00:02:35.310> I<00:02:35.610> think<00:02:35.970> a<00:02:36.060> lantern<00:02:36.420> could<00:02:36.600> just

00:02:36.740 --> 00:02:36.750 
lantern I think a lantern could just

00:02:36.750 --> 00:02:38.120 
lantern I think a lantern could just
make<00:02:36.870> something<00:02:37.110> that<00:02:37.350> fits<00:02:37.560> of<00:02:37.740> so<00:02:37.890> many<00:02:38.010> more

00:02:38.120 --> 00:02:38.130 
make something that fits of so many more

00:02:38.130 --> 00:02:39.410 
make something that fits of so many more
builds<00:02:38.460> and<00:02:38.580> again<00:02:38.850> it's<00:02:39.030> just<00:02:39.090> one<00:02:39.270> of<00:02:39.330> those

00:02:39.410 --> 00:02:39.420 
builds and again it's just one of those

00:02:39.420 --> 00:02:41.480 
builds and again it's just one of those
things<00:02:39.660> that<00:02:39.840> could<00:02:40.620> work<00:02:40.830> for<00:02:41.010> builders<00:02:41.370> with

00:02:41.480 --> 00:02:41.490 
things that could work for builders with

00:02:41.490 --> 00:02:42.740 
things that could work for builders with
their<00:02:41.640> whole<00:02:41.790> own<00:02:42.000> thing<00:02:42.240> but<00:02:42.420> it<00:02:42.510> could<00:02:42.600> also

00:02:42.740 --> 00:02:42.750 
their whole own thing but it could also

00:02:42.750 --> 00:02:44.150 
their whole own thing but it could also
work<00:02:42.990> for<00:02:43.110> just<00:02:43.260> regular<00:02:43.530> survival<00:02:43.950> players

00:02:44.150 --> 00:02:44.160 
work for just regular survival players

00:02:44.160 --> 00:02:45.680 
work for just regular survival players
if<00:02:44.310> you<00:02:44.400> get<00:02:44.550> up<00:02:44.640> a<00:02:44.730> higher<00:02:44.940> light<00:02:45.210> level<00:02:45.510> and

00:02:45.680 --> 00:02:45.690 
if you get up a higher light level and

00:02:45.690 --> 00:02:47.300 
if you get up a higher light level and
make<00:02:45.810> it<00:02:45.930> difficult<00:02:46.140> crops<00:02:46.590> or<00:02:46.740> something<00:02:47.010> or

00:02:47.300 --> 00:02:47.310 
make it difficult crops or something or

00:02:47.310 --> 00:02:48.620 
make it difficult crops or something or
get<00:02:47.490> a<00:02:47.520> lower<00:02:47.760> light<00:02:47.970> level<00:02:48.240> and<00:02:48.390> give<00:02:48.540> it

00:02:48.620 --> 00:02:48.630 
get a lower light level and give it

00:02:48.630 --> 00:02:50.240 
get a lower light level and give it
different<00:02:48.900> purposes<00:02:49.230> I<00:02:49.380> think<00:02:49.830> just<00:02:50.040> you<00:02:50.160> know

00:02:50.240 --> 00:02:50.250 
different purposes I think just you know

00:02:50.250 --> 00:02:51.440 
different purposes I think just you know
having<00:02:50.580> the<00:02:50.700> ability<00:02:51.030> to<00:02:51.060> have<00:02:51.210> something

00:02:51.440 --> 00:02:51.450 
having the ability to have something

00:02:51.450 --> 00:02:53.180 
having the ability to have something
like<00:02:51.480> that<00:02:51.690> would<00:02:51.810> be<00:02:51.840> useful<00:02:52.290> again<00:02:52.950> you<00:02:53.070> can

00:02:53.180 --> 00:02:53.190 
like that would be useful again you can

00:02:53.190 --> 00:02:54.380 
like that would be useful again you can
argue<00:02:53.310> there's<00:02:53.550> the<00:02:53.670> Redstone<00:02:54.060> then<00:02:54.210> some<00:02:54.330> but

00:02:54.380 --> 00:02:54.390 
argue there's the Redstone then some but

00:02:54.390 --> 00:02:55.910 
argue there's the Redstone then some but
we<00:02:54.480> just<00:02:54.630> don't<00:02:54.780> have<00:02:54.840> anything<00:02:55.050> that<00:02:55.230> a<00:02:55.530> true

00:02:55.910 --> 00:02:55.920 
we just don't have anything that a true

00:02:55.920 --> 00:02:57.530 
we just don't have anything that a true
you<00:02:56.190> know<00:02:56.310> light<00:02:56.580> source<00:02:56.880> like<00:02:57.150> you'd<00:02:57.300> have<00:02:57.450> in

00:02:57.530 --> 00:02:57.540 
you know light source like you'd have in

00:02:57.540 --> 00:02:58.970 
you know light source like you'd have in
a<00:02:57.570> real<00:02:57.720> life<00:02:57.960> maybe<00:02:58.230> that's<00:02:58.410> part<00:02:58.470> the<00:02:58.710> female

00:02:58.970 --> 00:02:58.980 
a real life maybe that's part the female

00:02:58.980 --> 00:03:00.530 
a real life maybe that's part the female
minecraft<00:02:59.340> but<00:02:59.670> to<00:02:59.790> me<00:02:59.910> the<00:03:00.030> lantern<00:03:00.240> is<00:03:00.510> a

00:03:00.530 --> 00:03:00.540 
minecraft but to me the lantern is a

00:03:00.540 --> 00:03:02.180 
minecraft but to me the lantern is a
good<00:03:00.930> enough<00:03:01.080> idea<00:03:01.260> that<00:03:01.590> I<00:03:01.620> think<00:03:01.680> it<00:03:01.980> could

00:03:02.180 --> 00:03:02.190 
good enough idea that I think it could

00:03:02.190 --> 00:03:04.370 
good enough idea that I think it could
see<00:03:02.370> a<00:03:02.400> return<00:03:02.880> at<00:03:03.030> some<00:03:03.210> point<00:03:03.450> so<00:03:03.660> this<00:03:03.990> next

00:03:04.370 --> 00:03:04.380 
see a return at some point so this next

00:03:04.380 --> 00:03:06.260 
see a return at some point so this next
one<00:03:04.530> is<00:03:04.560> one<00:03:04.770> I<00:03:05.190> think<00:03:05.520> makes<00:03:05.700> a<00:03:05.820> lot<00:03:05.850> of<00:03:06.000> sense

00:03:06.260 --> 00:03:06.270 
one is one I think makes a lot of sense

00:03:06.270 --> 00:03:07.460 
one is one I think makes a lot of sense
to<00:03:06.390> anyone<00:03:06.540> who's<00:03:06.720> ever<00:03:06.840> thought<00:03:07.080> about<00:03:07.260> how

00:03:07.460 --> 00:03:07.470 
to anyone who's ever thought about how

00:03:07.470 --> 00:03:09.080 
to anyone who's ever thought about how
fishing<00:03:07.830> works<00:03:08.010> in<00:03:08.160> Minecraft<00:03:08.550> because<00:03:08.880> not

00:03:09.080 --> 00:03:09.090 
fishing works in Minecraft because not

00:03:09.090 --> 00:03:10.490 
fishing works in Minecraft because not
to<00:03:09.210> mention<00:03:09.390> that<00:03:09.630> at<00:03:09.750> one<00:03:09.930> point<00:03:09.960> he<00:03:10.200> wanted

00:03:10.490 --> 00:03:10.500 
to mention that at one point he wanted

00:03:10.500 --> 00:03:12.260 
to mention that at one point he wanted
to<00:03:10.590> have<00:03:10.710> fish<00:03:10.950> be<00:03:11.190> a<00:03:11.220> natural<00:03:11.670> mob<00:03:11.940> that<00:03:12.180> you

00:03:12.260 --> 00:03:12.270 
to have fish be a natural mob that you

00:03:12.270 --> 00:03:14.180 
to have fish be a natural mob that you
can<00:03:12.480> catch<00:03:12.660> from<00:03:12.900> the<00:03:13.050> sea<00:03:13.260> so<00:03:13.710> I'm<00:03:13.920> basically

00:03:14.180 --> 00:03:14.190 
can catch from the sea so I'm basically

00:03:14.190 --> 00:03:15.680 
can catch from the sea so I'm basically
he<00:03:14.550> said<00:03:14.730> that<00:03:14.880> he<00:03:14.970> was<00:03:15.090> gonna<00:03:15.210> you<00:03:15.420> know<00:03:15.510> add

00:03:15.680 --> 00:03:15.690 
he said that he was gonna you know add

00:03:15.690 --> 00:03:16.880 
he said that he was gonna you know add
the<00:03:15.900> fish<00:03:16.140> model<00:03:16.440> that<00:03:16.590> you<00:03:16.650> can<00:03:16.770> actually

00:03:16.880 --> 00:03:16.890 
the fish model that you can actually

00:03:16.890 --> 00:03:18.830 
the fish model that you can actually
catch<00:03:17.250> in<00:03:17.459> the<00:03:17.550> sea<00:03:17.700> by<00:03:17.820> itself<00:03:18.060> however<00:03:18.480> you

00:03:18.830 --> 00:03:18.840 
catch in the sea by itself however you

00:03:18.840 --> 00:03:20.210 
catch in the sea by itself however you
know<00:03:18.959> in<00:03:19.110> that<00:03:19.230> whole<00:03:19.290> time<00:03:19.590> we've<00:03:19.800> never<00:03:19.980> seen

00:03:20.210 --> 00:03:20.220 
know in that whole time we've never seen

00:03:20.220 --> 00:03:22.250 
know in that whole time we've never seen
the<00:03:20.370> model<00:03:20.640> but<00:03:21.090> the<00:03:21.510> thing<00:03:21.780> you<00:03:21.989> know<00:03:22.140> that

00:03:22.250 --> 00:03:22.260 
the model but the thing you know that

00:03:22.260 --> 00:03:23.390 
the model but the thing you know that
makes<00:03:22.440> me<00:03:22.560> think<00:03:22.739> this<00:03:22.830> isn't<00:03:23.010> just<00:03:23.280> an

00:03:23.390 --> 00:03:23.400 
makes me think this isn't just an

00:03:23.400 --> 00:03:25.220 
makes me think this isn't just an
offshoot<00:03:23.820> idea<00:03:24.209> is<00:03:24.360> the<00:03:24.510> fact<00:03:24.720> that<00:03:24.840> since

00:03:25.220 --> 00:03:25.230 
offshoot idea is the fact that since

00:03:25.230 --> 00:03:26.900 
offshoot idea is the fact that since
then<00:03:25.500> some<00:03:25.920> remind<00:03:26.250> him<00:03:26.370> in<00:03:26.430> a<00:03:26.489> reddit<00:03:26.730> Fred

00:03:26.900 --> 00:03:26.910 
then some remind him in a reddit Fred

00:03:26.910 --> 00:03:28.610 
then some remind him in a reddit Fred
and<00:03:27.060> he's<00:03:27.180> like<00:03:27.300> oh<00:03:27.450> yeah<00:03:27.690> the<00:03:27.870> fish<00:03:28.110> and<00:03:28.290> then

00:03:28.610 --> 00:03:28.620 
and he's like oh yeah the fish and then

00:03:28.620 --> 00:03:30.650 
and he's like oh yeah the fish and then
even<00:03:28.980> after<00:03:29.160> that<00:03:29.370> one<00:03:29.970> of<00:03:30.060> the<00:03:30.150> other<00:03:30.270> Mojang

00:03:30.650 --> 00:03:30.660 
even after that one of the other Mojang

00:03:30.660 --> 00:03:32.180 
even after that one of the other Mojang
staff<00:03:30.870> members<00:03:31.200> said<00:03:31.440> that<00:03:31.620> he's<00:03:31.739> planning<00:03:32.160> to

from now I think you know sink fish is a

00:03:43.920 --> 00:03:45.410 
from now I think you know sink fish is a
mob<00:03:44.130> would<00:03:44.220> be<00:03:44.370> really<00:03:44.700> cool<00:03:44.910> because<00:03:45.090> right

00:03:50.780 --> 00:03:50.790 
wait for random numbers to decide I can

00:03:50.790 --> 00:03:52.190 
wait for random numbers to decide I can
go<00:03:50.880> fishing<00:03:51.209> whereas<00:03:51.600> if<00:03:51.720> they<00:03:51.840> were<00:03:51.900> actual

00:03:52.190 --> 00:03:52.200

00:03:53.750 --> 00:03:53.760 
fish swimming around the water it feel

00:03:53.760 --> 00:03:55.280 
fish swimming around the water it feel
like<00:03:53.910> it'd<00:03:54.060> be<00:03:54.180> more<00:03:54.360> skill-based<00:03:54.660> it'd<00:03:55.080> be<00:03:55.260> a

00:03:55.280 --> 00:03:55.290 
like it'd be more skill-based it'd be a

00:03:55.290 --> 00:03:57.050 
like it'd be more skill-based it'd be a
lot<00:03:55.530> more<00:03:55.650> fun<00:03:55.890> and<00:03:56.130> I<00:03:56.489> I<00:03:56.519> would<00:03:56.820> like<00:03:57.030> that

00:03:57.050 --> 00:03:57.060 
lot more fun and I I would like that

00:03:57.060 --> 00:03:59.300 
lot more fun and I I would like that
system<00:03:57.510> a<00:03:57.540> lot<00:03:57.660> more<00:03:57.840> so<00:03:58.019> fish<00:03:58.290> is<00:03:58.470> a<00:03:58.530> very<00:03:59.130> cool

00:03:59.300 --> 00:03:59.310 
system a lot more so fish is a very cool

00:03:59.310 --> 00:04:01.460 
system a lot more so fish is a very cool
idea<00:03:59.430> to<00:03:59.640> me<00:03:59.940> at<00:04:00.120> the<00:04:00.239> very<00:04:00.269> least<00:04:00.570> and<00:04:00.810> that's

00:04:01.460 --> 00:04:01.470 
idea to me at the very least and that's

00:04:01.470 --> 00:04:02.870 
idea to me at the very least and that's
why<00:04:01.709> I<00:04:01.739> think<00:04:01.860> it<00:04:02.040> would<00:04:02.130> be<00:04:02.190> pretty<00:04:02.310> cool<00:04:02.550> the

00:04:02.870 --> 00:04:02.880 
why I think it would be pretty cool the

00:04:02.880 --> 00:04:04.759 
why I think it would be pretty cool the
next<00:04:03.180> one<00:04:03.360> is<00:04:03.570> kind<00:04:03.810> of<00:04:03.900> an<00:04:03.989> ambitious<00:04:04.380> one<00:04:04.530> and

00:04:04.759 --> 00:04:04.769 
next one is kind of an ambitious one and

00:04:04.769 --> 00:04:05.780 
next one is kind of an ambitious one and
you'll<00:04:04.890> notice<00:04:05.160> we're<00:04:05.340> getting<00:04:05.400> more<00:04:05.700> and

00:04:05.780 --> 00:04:05.790 
you'll notice we're getting more and

00:04:05.790 --> 00:04:07.009 
you'll notice we're getting more and
more<00:04:05.880> ambitious<00:04:06.000> as<00:04:06.420> we<00:04:06.600> go<00:04:06.750> along<00:04:06.870> here

00:04:07.009 --> 00:04:07.019 
more ambitious as we go along here

00:04:07.019 --> 00:04:09.170 
more ambitious as we go along here
because<00:04:07.650> this<00:04:07.769> is<00:04:07.920> a<00:04:07.950> built-in<00:04:08.430> friends<00:04:09.000> list

00:04:09.170 --> 00:04:09.180 
because this is a built-in friends list

00:04:09.180 --> 00:04:10.759 
because this is a built-in friends list
in<00:04:09.300> minecraft<00:04:09.750> and<00:04:09.930> although<00:04:10.200> I<00:04:10.320> think<00:04:10.470> you

00:04:10.759 --> 00:04:10.769 
in minecraft and although I think you

00:04:10.769 --> 00:04:12.320

00:04:12.320 --> 00:04:12.330 
know back when he came up the idea and

00:04:12.330 --> 00:04:13.880 
know back when he came up the idea and
it<00:04:12.390> was<00:04:12.420> just<00:04:12.660> a<00:04:12.780> PC<00:04:13.140> only<00:04:13.380> game<00:04:13.560> because<00:04:13.769> that

00:04:13.880 --> 00:04:13.890 
it was just a PC only game because that

00:04:13.890 --> 00:04:15.800 
it was just a PC only game because that
was<00:04:14.010> around<00:04:14.459> about<00:04:14.640> the<00:04:14.760> time<00:04:14.790> of<00:04:14.970> beta<00:04:15.209> 1.8<00:04:15.720> on

00:04:15.800 --> 00:04:15.810

00:04:17.990 --> 00:04:18.000 
PC basically you know not Chad the idea

00:04:18.000 --> 00:04:19.009 
PC basically you know not Chad the idea
that<00:04:18.180> you<00:04:18.330> should<00:04:18.359> be<00:04:18.540> able<00:04:18.630> to<00:04:18.720> just<00:04:18.870> have

00:04:43.620 --> 00:04:45.260 
to unify them the best way to do that is
a<00:04:43.710> built<00:04:43.950> in<00:04:44.040> friends<00:04:44.340> list<00:04:44.490> on<00:04:44.580> minecraft<00:04:45.090> so

00:04:45.260 --> 00:04:45.270 
a built in friends list on minecraft so

00:04:45.270 --> 00:04:46.640 
a built in friends list on minecraft so
you're<00:04:45.420> not<00:04:45.570> tied<00:04:45.840> to<00:04:45.990> the<00:04:46.080> fact<00:04:46.320> that<00:04:46.440> you

00:04:46.640 --> 00:04:46.650 
you're not tied to the fact that you

00:04:46.650 --> 00:04:48.170 
you're not tied to the fact that you
know<00:04:46.770> you're<00:04:46.950> on<00:04:47.100> the<00:04:47.130> platform<00:04:47.610> like<00:04:47.760> if<00:04:47.970> I

00:04:48.170 --> 00:04:48.180 
know you're on the platform like if I

00:04:48.180 --> 00:04:49.820 
know you're on the platform like if I
want<00:04:48.330> to<00:04:48.390> talk<00:04:48.570> to<00:04:48.720> my<00:04:48.840> you<00:04:48.900> know<00:04:49.140> ps3<00:04:49.590> friend

want to talk to my you know ps3 friend

00:04:49.830 --> 00:04:51.590 
want to talk to my you know ps3 friend
of<00:04:49.890> my<00:04:49.950> 360<00:04:50.250> I<00:04:50.580> can't<00:04:50.850> but<00:04:51.150> if<00:04:51.330> they<00:04:51.450> had<00:04:51.570> a

00:04:51.590 --> 00:04:51.600 
of my 360 I can't but if they had a

00:04:51.600 --> 00:04:53.300 
of my 360 I can't but if they had a
built-in<00:04:51.900> friend<00:04:52.140> says<00:04:52.290> I<00:04:52.440> took<00:04:52.650> my<00:04:52.950> PC

00:04:53.300 --> 00:04:53.310 
built-in friend says I took my PC

00:04:53.310 --> 00:04:55.190 
built-in friend says I took my PC
friends<00:04:53.760> my<00:04:53.940> pocket<00:04:54.300> Ocean<00:04:54.510> friends<00:04:54.810> and<00:04:54.960> my

00:04:55.190 --> 00:04:55.200

friends my pocket Ocean friends and my
ps3<00:04:55.740> ps4<00:04:56.040> friend<00:04:56.460> all<00:04:56.760> from<00:04:57.000> the<00:04:57.090> Xbox<00:04:57.300> 64

00:04:57.890 --> 00:04:57.900 
ps3 ps4 friend all from the Xbox 64

00:04:57.900 --> 00:04:59.630 
ps3 ps4 friend all from the Xbox 64
instance<00:04:58.170> and<00:04:58.350> I<00:04:58.410> think<00:04:58.680> it<00:04:59.040> would<00:04:59.160> be<00:04:59.280> a<00:04:59.310> big

00:04:59.630 --> 00:04:59.640 
instance and I think it would be a big

00:04:59.640 --> 00:05:01.460 
instance and I think it would be a big
art<00:04:59.880> for<00:05:00.180> all<00:05:00.330> the<00:05:00.600> teams<00:05:00.810> to<00:05:00.960> do<00:05:01.050> this<00:05:01.170> at<00:05:01.290> once

00:05:01.460 --> 00:05:01.470 
art for all the teams to do this at once

00:05:01.470 --> 00:05:02.690 
art for all the teams to do this at once
but<00:05:01.680> I<00:05:01.710> think<00:05:01.980> this<00:05:02.040> is<00:05:02.160> one<00:05:02.310> of<00:05:02.370> the<00:05:02.430> features

00:05:02.690 --> 00:05:02.700 
but I think this is one of the features

00:05:02.700 --> 00:05:04.160 
but I think this is one of the features
that<00:05:02.730> is<00:05:02.970> very<00:05:03.270> likely<00:05:03.570> in<00:05:03.750> the<00:05:03.840> future

00:05:04.160 --> 00:05:04.170 
that is very likely in the future

00:05:04.170 --> 00:05:06.170 
that is very likely in the future
because<00:05:04.680> once<00:05:04.920> you<00:05:05.040> have<00:05:05.190> realms<00:05:05.550> there<00:05:05.700> -<00:05:05.940> it

00:05:06.170 --> 00:05:06.180 
because once you have realms there - it

00:05:06.180 --> 00:05:07.460 
because once you have realms there - it
allows<00:05:06.420> you<00:05:06.570> to<00:05:06.600> play<00:05:06.870> with<00:05:06.900> the<00:05:07.140> people<00:05:07.290> on

00:05:07.460 --> 00:05:07.470 
allows you to play with the people on

00:05:07.470 --> 00:05:08.870 
allows you to play with the people on
all<00:05:07.560> these<00:05:07.650> consoles<00:05:08.070> and<00:05:08.310> it's<00:05:08.550> just<00:05:08.670> one<00:05:08.850> of

00:05:08.870 --> 00:05:08.880 
all these consoles and it's just one of

00:05:08.880 --> 00:05:10.790 
all these consoles and it's just one of
those<00:05:09.060> massive<00:05:09.570> ideas<00:05:09.990> that<00:05:10.290> might<00:05:10.590> not<00:05:10.770> be

00:05:10.790 --> 00:05:10.800 
those massive ideas that might not be

00:05:10.800 --> 00:05:12.440 
those massive ideas that might not be
the<00:05:11.100> next<00:05:11.370> update<00:05:11.550> but<00:05:11.970> it's<00:05:12.090> one<00:05:12.240> of<00:05:12.270> those

00:05:12.440 --> 00:05:12.450 
the next update but it's one of those

00:05:12.450 --> 00:05:13.970 
the next update but it's one of those
big<00:05:12.780> updates<00:05:13.080> the<00:05:13.230> game<00:05:13.260> that<00:05:13.590> I<00:05:13.680> think<00:05:13.710> is

00:05:13.970 --> 00:05:13.980 
big updates the game that I think is

00:05:13.980 --> 00:05:15.560 
big updates the game that I think is
pretty<00:05:14.160> cool<00:05:14.490> so<00:05:14.760> yeah<00:05:15.180> the<00:05:15.300> friends<00:05:15.540> list

00:05:15.560 --> 00:05:15.570 
pretty cool so yeah the friends list

00:05:15.570 --> 00:05:17.540 
pretty cool so yeah the friends list
quite<00:05:15.870> ambitious<00:05:16.170> project<00:05:16.680> but<00:05:16.950> it<00:05:17.040> allows<00:05:17.250> so

00:05:17.540 --> 00:05:17.550 
quite ambitious project but it allows so

00:05:17.550 --> 00:05:19.790 
quite ambitious project but it allows so
much<00:05:17.760> and<00:05:18.000> the<00:05:18.570> next<00:05:18.900> you<00:05:19.230> know<00:05:19.350> the<00:05:19.380> couple

00:05:19.790 --> 00:05:19.800 
much and the next you know the couple

00:05:19.800 --> 00:05:21.440 
much and the next you know the couple
light<00:05:19.890> or<00:05:20.130> kind<00:05:20.670> of<00:05:20.700> two<00:05:20.880> things<00:05:21.120> in<00:05:21.270> one

00:05:21.440 --> 00:05:21.450 
light or kind of two things in one

00:05:21.450 --> 00:05:23.120 
light or kind of two things in one
for<00:05:21.780> the<00:05:21.870> fifth<00:05:22.170> feature<00:05:22.380> that<00:05:22.740> notch<00:05:22.950> has

00:05:23.120 --> 00:05:23.130 
for the fifth feature that notch has

00:05:23.130 --> 00:05:25.340 
for the fifth feature that notch has
mentioned<00:05:23.370> this<00:05:24.000> one<00:05:24.270> is<00:05:24.390> really<00:05:24.690> insane<00:05:25.080> and

00:05:25.340 --> 00:05:25.350 
mentioned this one is really insane and

00:05:25.350 --> 00:05:27.170 
mentioned this one is really insane and
it<00:05:25.500> was<00:05:25.590> some<00:05:25.770> so<00:05:26.040> far<00:05:26.370> away<00:05:26.610> that<00:05:26.820> I<00:05:26.910> think

00:05:27.170 --> 00:05:27.180 
it was some so far away that I think

00:05:27.180 --> 00:05:29.930 
it was some so far away that I think
it's<00:05:27.450> very<00:05:27.900> unlikely<00:05:28.200> at<00:05:28.620> this<00:05:28.710> point<00:05:28.950> but<00:05:29.490> is

00:05:29.930 --> 00:05:29.940 
it's very unlikely at this point but is

00:05:29.940 --> 00:05:32.360 
it's very unlikely at this point but is
it<00:05:30.420> has<00:05:30.600> been<00:05:30.810> mentioned<00:05:31.050> basically<00:05:31.860> back<00:05:32.190> in

00:05:32.360 --> 00:05:32.370 
it has been mentioned basically back in

00:05:32.370 --> 00:05:34.280 
it has been mentioned basically back in
2009<00:05:32.970> when<00:05:33.270> the<00:05:33.360> game<00:05:33.480> was<00:05:33.510> first<00:05:33.630> put<00:05:33.960> out<00:05:34.050> so

00:05:34.280 --> 00:05:34.290 
2009 when the game was first put out so

00:05:34.290 --> 00:05:36.409 
2009 when the game was first put out so

about the game modes that were gonna be
in<00:05:42.060> the<00:05:42.150> game<00:05:42.360> at<00:05:42.600> the<00:05:42.720> time<00:05:42.990> at<00:05:43.200> the<00:05:43.350> time<00:05:43.560> it

00:05:43.700 --> 00:05:43.710 
in the game at the time at the time it

00:05:43.710 --> 00:05:45.230 
in the game at the time at the time it
was<00:05:43.800> a<00:05:43.830> very<00:05:43.919> basic<00:05:44.550> game<00:05:44.940> where<00:05:45.150> you<00:05:45.210> just

00:05:45.230 --> 00:05:45.240 
was a very basic game where you just

00:05:45.240 --> 00:05:46.610 
was a very basic game where you just
place<00:05:45.600> some<00:05:45.750> blocks<00:05:45.900> and<00:05:46.200> was<00:05:46.290> kind<00:05:46.440> of<00:05:46.470> like<00:05:46.560> a

00:05:46.610 --> 00:05:46.620 
place some blocks and was kind of like a

00:05:46.620 --> 00:05:48.380 
place some blocks and was kind of like a
hybrid<00:05:46.980> between<00:05:47.130> creative<00:05:47.669> and<00:05:47.820> survival<00:05:48.270> and

00:05:48.380 --> 00:05:48.390 
hybrid between creative and survival and

00:05:48.390 --> 00:05:49.730 
hybrid between creative and survival and
he<00:05:48.750> mentioned<00:05:49.080> the<00:05:49.110> game<00:05:49.350> modes<00:05:49.530> that<00:05:49.620> are

00:05:49.730 --> 00:05:49.740 
he mentioned the game modes that are

00:05:49.740 --> 00:05:51.110 
he mentioned the game modes that are
gonna<00:05:49.890> be<00:05:49.980> in<00:05:50.010> Minecraft<00:05:50.550> so<00:05:50.669> he<00:05:50.820> mentions

00:05:51.110 --> 00:05:51.120 
gonna be in Minecraft so he mentions

00:05:51.120 --> 00:05:52.850 
gonna be in Minecraft so he mentions
creative<00:05:51.570> mode<00:05:51.750> you<00:05:52.110> get<00:05:52.230> mplet<00:05:52.500> materials

00:05:52.850 --> 00:05:52.860 
creative mode you get mplet materials

00:05:52.860 --> 00:05:54.530 
creative mode you get mplet materials
and<00:05:53.010> build<00:05:53.280> about<00:05:53.490> delay<00:05:53.820> can<00:05:54.090> be<00:05:54.150> played<00:05:54.360> both

00:05:54.530 --> 00:05:54.540 
and build about delay can be played both

00:05:54.540 --> 00:05:56.180 
and build about delay can be played both
for<00:05:54.720> single-player<00:05:55.080> and<00:05:55.290> multiplayer<00:05:55.410> and

00:05:56.180 --> 00:05:56.190 
for single-player and multiplayer and

00:05:56.190 --> 00:05:57.800 
for single-player and multiplayer and
then<00:05:56.550> there's<00:05:56.730> survival<00:05:57.300> mode<00:05:57.480> which<00:05:57.660> is

00:05:57.800 --> 00:05:57.810 
then there's survival mode which is

00:05:57.810 --> 00:05:59.390 
then there's survival mode which is
single-player<00:05:58.260> or<00:05:58.380> cooperative<00:05:59.070> where<00:05:59.340> you

to stay healthy if gap materials you

00:06:02.550 --> 00:06:04.010 
to stay healthy if gap materials you
wish<00:06:02.700> to<00:06:02.850> use<00:06:02.970> and<00:06:03.150> construction<00:06:03.360> takes<00:06:03.780> time

00:06:04.010 --> 00:06:04.020 
wish to use and construction takes time

00:06:04.020 --> 00:06:05.630 
wish to use and construction takes time
mining<00:06:04.530> for<00:06:04.680> stone<00:06:04.860> is<00:06:05.010> slower<00:06:05.190> than<00:06:05.280> dirt

00:06:05.630 --> 00:06:05.640 
mining for stone is slower than dirt

00:06:05.640 --> 00:06:07.909 
mining for stone is slower than dirt
it's<00:06:05.880> so<00:06:06.330> crazy<00:06:06.840> when<00:06:07.200> you<00:06:07.290> think<00:06:07.530> about<00:06:07.620> the

00:06:07.909 --> 00:06:07.919 
it's so crazy when you think about the

00:06:07.919 --> 00:06:09.470 
it's so crazy when you think about the
fact<00:06:08.130> that<00:06:08.250> he<00:06:08.430> mentioned<00:06:08.700> this<00:06:08.790> way<00:06:09.090> before

00:06:09.470 --> 00:06:09.480 
fact that he mentioned this way before

00:06:09.480 --> 00:06:11.510 
fact that he mentioned this way before
these<00:06:09.660> like<00:06:10.050> the<00:06:10.350> hunger<00:06:10.830> only<00:06:10.919> came<00:06:11.220> in<00:06:11.370> like

00:06:11.510 --> 00:06:11.520 
these like the hunger only came in like

00:06:11.520 --> 00:06:13.700 
these like the hunger only came in like
four<00:06:11.940> light<00:06:12.180> years<00:06:12.210> later<00:06:12.570> it's<00:06:12.900> crazy<00:06:13.440> that

00:06:13.700 --> 00:06:13.710 
four light years later it's crazy that

00:06:13.710 --> 00:06:14.990 
four light years later it's crazy that
he<00:06:13.770> came<00:06:14.010> up<00:06:14.130> with<00:06:14.250> all<00:06:14.370> of<00:06:14.490> this<00:06:14.580> stuff<00:06:14.820> back

00:06:14.990 --> 00:06:15.000 
he came up with all of this stuff back

00:06:15.000 --> 00:06:16.280 
he came up with all of this stuff back
then<00:06:15.240> and<00:06:15.450> he<00:06:15.630> actually<00:06:15.870> followed<00:06:16.020> through<00:06:16.169> on

00:06:16.280 --> 00:06:16.290 
then and he actually followed through on

00:06:16.290 --> 00:06:18.230 
then and he actually followed through on
it<00:06:16.470> so<00:06:16.740> maybe<00:06:17.040> team<00:06:17.310> survive<00:06:17.610> mode<00:06:17.850> is<00:06:18.000> going

00:06:18.230 --> 00:06:18.240 
it so maybe team survive mode is going

00:06:18.240 --> 00:06:19.790 
it so maybe team survive mode is going
at<00:06:18.419> something<00:06:18.750> so<00:06:18.930> team<00:06:19.080> survival<00:06:19.500> was<00:06:19.590> just

00:06:19.790 --> 00:06:19.800 
at something so team survival was just

00:06:19.800 --> 00:06:20.990 
at something so team survival was just
you<00:06:19.890> know<00:06:20.010> it's<00:06:20.160> survival<00:06:20.640> mode<00:06:20.760> but<00:06:20.970> you

00:06:20.990 --> 00:06:21.000 
you know it's survival mode but you

00:06:21.000 --> 00:06:22.550 
you know it's survival mode but you
divide<00:06:21.300> into<00:06:21.450> two<00:06:21.690> teams<00:06:21.720> you<00:06:22.320> have<00:06:22.440> to

00:06:22.550 --> 00:06:22.560 
divide into two teams you have to

00:06:22.560 --> 00:06:23.930 
divide into two teams you have to
survive<00:06:22.860> but<00:06:23.100> you<00:06:23.190> also<00:06:23.340> have<00:06:23.490> to<00:06:23.550> fight<00:06:23.730> sugar

00:06:23.930 --> 00:06:23.940 
survive but you also have to fight sugar

00:06:23.940 --> 00:06:26.000 
survive but you also have to fight sugar
and<00:06:24.150> then<00:06:24.419> the<00:06:24.570> crazy<00:06:24.990> one<00:06:25.320> to<00:06:25.500> meet<00:06:25.680> is<00:06:25.950> a

00:06:26.000 --> 00:06:26.010 
and then the crazy one to meet is a

00:06:26.010 --> 00:06:27.830 
and then the crazy one to meet is a
fortress<00:06:26.669> mode<00:06:26.970> and<00:06:27.180> this<00:06:27.330> is<00:06:27.480> one<00:06:27.660> I<00:06:27.690> think

00:06:27.830 --> 00:06:27.840 
fortress mode and this is one I think

00:06:27.840 --> 00:06:29.810 
fortress mode and this is one I think
probably<00:06:28.800> would<00:06:28.950> work<00:06:29.040> as<00:06:29.310> a<00:06:29.340> mod<00:06:29.580> for<00:06:29.790> a

00:06:29.810 --> 00:06:29.820 
probably would work as a mod for a

00:06:29.820 --> 00:06:31.340 
probably would work as a mod for a
server<00:06:30.060> but<00:06:30.450> I<00:06:30.510> think<00:06:30.750> it'd<00:06:30.840> be<00:06:30.960> cool<00:06:31.169> to<00:06:31.200> be

00:06:31.340 --> 00:06:31.350 
server but I think it'd be cool to be

00:06:31.350 --> 00:06:32.960 
server but I think it'd be cool to be
burned<00:06:31.590> minecraft<00:06:32.010> where<00:06:32.340> after<00:06:32.580> you<00:06:32.820> have

00:06:32.960 --> 00:06:32.970 
burned minecraft where after you have

00:06:32.970 --> 00:06:34.790 
burned minecraft where after you have
built<00:06:33.240> a<00:06:33.330> level<00:06:33.510> in<00:06:33.780> creative<00:06:34.140> or<00:06:34.290> survival

00:06:34.790 --> 00:06:34.800 
built a level in creative or survival

00:06:34.800 --> 00:06:36.260 
built a level in creative or survival
you<00:06:35.130> can<00:06:35.340> you<00:06:35.550> know<00:06:35.669> play<00:06:35.789> against<00:06:36.030> someone

00:06:36.260 --> 00:06:36.270 
you can you know play against someone

00:06:36.270 --> 00:06:37.969 
you can you know play against someone
else's<00:06:36.539> fortress<00:06:37.080> and<00:06:37.229> you<00:06:37.410> both<00:06:37.650> have<00:06:37.860> to

came<00:06:46.020> but<00:06:46.380> it's<00:06:46.500> just<00:06:46.650> one<00:06:46.830> of<00:06:46.860> those

00:06:47.060 --> 00:06:47.070 
came but it's just one of those

00:06:47.070 --> 00:06:49.340 
came but it's just one of those
massively<00:06:47.790> quite<00:06:48.180> is<00:06:48.420> that<00:06:48.720> would<00:06:48.840> take<00:06:49.050> a<00:06:49.080> lot

00:06:49.340 --> 00:06:49.350 
massively quite is that would take a lot

00:06:49.350 --> 00:06:51.050 
massively quite is that would take a lot
of<00:06:49.440> work<00:06:49.650> but<00:06:49.950> imagine<00:06:50.430> playing<00:06:50.640> capture<00:06:50.910> the

how to built the best thing maybe

00:06:55.830 --> 00:06:56.720 
how to built the best thing maybe
they'll<00:06:56.040> get<00:06:56.190> away<00:06:56.280> from<00:06:56.400> the<00:06:56.550> point<00:06:56.700> of

they'll get away from the point of
Minecraft<00:06:57.180> but<00:06:57.390> to<00:06:57.630> me<00:06:57.840> it<00:06:58.080> sounds<00:06:58.350> like<00:06:58.500> the

00:06:58.670 --> 00:06:58.680 
Minecraft but to me it sounds like the

00:06:58.680 --> 00:07:00.740 
Minecraft but to me it sounds like the
most<00:06:58.800> epic<00:06:59.010> game<00:06:59.340> mode<00:06:59.730> ever<00:06:59.940> and<00:07:00.240> I<00:07:00.480> kinda

00:07:00.740 --> 00:07:00.750

want to just play it anyway like give to

00:07:02.040 --> 00:07:03.830 
want to just play it anyway like give to
you<00:07:02.370> two<00:07:02.580> teams<00:07:02.790> like<00:07:03.030> I<00:07:03.150> don't<00:07:03.210> know<00:07:03.330> let's

00:07:03.830 --> 00:07:03.840 
you two teams like I don't know let's

00:07:03.840 --> 00:07:05.180 
you two teams like I don't know let's
say<00:07:03.960> ten<00:07:04.170> minutes<00:07:04.410> in<00:07:04.500> creative<00:07:04.830> to<00:07:04.950> build<00:07:05.130> a

00:07:05.180 --> 00:07:05.190 
say ten minutes in creative to build a

00:07:05.190 --> 00:07:06.800 
say ten minutes in creative to build a
fortress<00:07:05.580> and<00:07:05.700> then<00:07:06.120> you<00:07:06.270> know<00:07:06.360> see<00:07:06.570> how<00:07:06.600> that

00:07:06.800 --> 00:07:06.810 
fortress and then you know see how that

00:07:06.810 --> 00:07:09.260 
fortress and then you know see how that
works<00:07:07.020> I<00:07:07.230> think<00:07:07.770> it's<00:07:07.920> a<00:07:08.010> cool<00:07:08.190> idea<00:07:08.220> uh<00:07:08.670> maybe

00:07:09.260 --> 00:07:09.270 
works I think it's a cool idea uh maybe

00:07:09.270 --> 00:07:10.760 
works I think it's a cool idea uh maybe
maybe<00:07:09.540> that's<00:07:09.900> a<00:07:10.080> game-mode<00:07:10.290> I<00:07:10.530> have<00:07:10.680> to

00:07:10.760 --> 00:07:10.770 
maybe that's a game-mode I have to

00:07:10.770 --> 00:07:12.590 
maybe that's a game-mode I have to
consider<00:07:11.070> just<00:07:11.280> making<00:07:11.700> by<00:07:11.820> myself<00:07:12.300> let<00:07:12.510> me

00:07:12.590 --> 00:07:12.600 
consider just making by myself let me

00:07:12.600 --> 00:07:14.330 
consider just making by myself let me
know<00:07:12.690> what<00:07:12.810> you<00:07:12.870> think<00:07:13.050> but<00:07:13.410> yeah<00:07:13.770> that<00:07:14.160> that

00:07:14.330 --> 00:07:14.340
