00:03:24.040 --> 00:03:24.050 
was gonna use this tool here but the

00:03:24.050 --> 00:03:25.979 
was gonna use this tool here but the
little<00:03:24.230> suction<00:03:24.440> cups<00:03:24.800> are<00:03:24.950> too<00:03:25.069> big<00:03:25.340> for

00:03:25.979 --> 00:03:25.989 
little suction cups are too big for

00:03:25.989 --> 00:03:28.479 
little suction cups are too big for
these<00:03:26.989> little<00:03:27.200> teeny<00:03:27.380> valves<00:03:27.860> probably<00:03:28.430> it

00:03:28.479 --> 00:03:28.489 
these little teeny valves probably it

00:03:28.489 --> 00:03:30.640 
these little teeny valves probably it
might<00:03:28.610> work<00:03:28.730> on<00:03:28.940> this<00:03:29.060> one<00:03:29.300> it'll<00:03:30.260> work<00:03:30.440> on<00:03:30.530> the

00:03:30.640 --> 00:03:30.650 
might work on this one it'll work on the

00:03:30.650 --> 00:03:31.809 
might work on this one it'll work on the
intakes<00:03:31.010> but<00:03:31.220> it<00:03:31.280> wouldn't<00:03:31.459> work<00:03:31.519> on<00:03:31.730> the

00:03:31.809 --> 00:03:31.819 
intakes but it wouldn't work on the

00:03:31.819 --> 00:03:34.150 
intakes but it wouldn't work on the
exhaust<00:03:32.260> so<00:03:33.260> I<00:03:33.319> had<00:03:33.440> to<00:03:33.500> come<00:03:33.620> up<00:03:33.680> with<00:03:33.830> a<00:03:33.890> way

00:03:34.150 --> 00:03:34.160 
exhaust so I had to come up with a way

00:03:34.160 --> 00:03:37.390 
exhaust so I had to come up with a way
to<00:03:34.190> lap<00:03:35.090> spin<00:03:36.019> the<00:03:36.140> valves<00:03:36.560> with<00:03:36.830> the<00:03:36.950> lapping

00:03:37.390 --> 00:03:37.400 
to lap spin the valves with the lapping

00:03:37.400 --> 00:03:43.390 
to lap spin the valves with the lapping
compound<00:03:38.709> to<00:03:41.230> to<00:03:42.230> lap<00:03:42.410> them<00:03:42.590> in<00:03:42.769> no<00:03:42.950> let<00:03:43.069> me<00:03:43.099> see

00:03:43.390 --> 00:03:43.400 
compound to to lap them in no let me see

00:03:43.400 --> 00:03:52.080 
compound to to lap them in no let me see
that<00:03:43.580> or<00:03:43.670> not<00:03:49.540> see<00:03:50.540> the<00:03:50.660> pattern<00:03:51.049> there<00:03:51.230> on<00:03:51.349> the

00:03:52.080 --> 00:03:52.090 
that or not see the pattern there on the

00:03:52.090 --> 00:03:57.130 
that or not see the pattern there on the
valve<00:03:53.090> face<00:03:54.099> the<00:03:55.099> seats<00:03:55.370> look<00:03:55.549> good<00:03:56.140> seat

00:03:57.130 --> 00:03:57.140 
valve face the seats look good seat

00:03:57.140 --> 00:04:00.640 
valve face the seats look good seat
their<00:03:57.319> heart<00:03:57.530> and<00:03:57.650> seats<00:03:59.260> so<00:04:00.260> there's<00:04:00.530> no

00:04:00.640 --> 00:04:00.650 
their heart and seats so there's no

00:04:00.650 --> 00:04:02.949 
their heart and seats so there's no
reason<00:04:00.980> why<00:04:01.099> that<00:04:01.299> the<00:04:02.299> seat<00:04:02.569> surface

00:04:02.949 --> 00:04:02.959 
reason why that the seat surface

00:04:02.959 --> 00:04:06.100 
reason why that the seat surface
wouldn't<00:04:03.650> remain<00:04:03.950> the<00:04:04.130> same<00:04:04.630> so<00:04:05.630> i<00:04:05.660> lapped<00:04:05.959> in

00:04:06.100 --> 00:04:06.110 
wouldn't remain the same so i lapped in

00:04:06.110 --> 00:04:08.170 
wouldn't remain the same so i lapped in
all<00:04:06.380> the<00:04:06.530> exhausts<00:04:07.010> already<00:04:07.370> and<00:04:07.610> they<00:04:08.000> look

00:04:08.170 --> 00:04:08.180 
all the exhausts already and they look

00:04:08.180 --> 00:04:10.240 
all the exhausts already and they look
good<00:04:08.390> so<00:04:09.260> I'm<00:04:09.319> going<00:04:09.440> to<00:04:09.470> lap<00:04:09.620> in<00:04:09.799> the<00:04:09.890> intakes

00:04:10.240 --> 00:04:10.250 
good so I'm going to lap in the intakes

00:04:10.250 --> 00:04:12.640 
good so I'm going to lap in the intakes
but<00:04:11.150> I<00:04:11.390> had<00:04:11.540> to<00:04:11.599> come<00:04:11.690> up<00:04:11.840> with<00:04:11.959> a<00:04:12.049> creative<00:04:12.410> way

00:04:12.640 --> 00:04:12.650 
but I had to come up with a creative way

00:04:12.650 --> 00:04:16.420 
but I had to come up with a creative way
to<00:04:14.139> to<00:04:15.139> spin<00:04:15.410> the<00:04:15.530> valves<00:04:15.920> you<00:04:15.980> know<00:04:16.070> to<00:04:16.250> lap

00:04:16.420 --> 00:04:16.430 
to to spin the valves you know to lap

00:04:16.430 --> 00:04:20.650 
to to spin the valves you know to lap
flap<00:04:16.789> them<00:04:16.940> in<00:04:19.239> because<00:04:20.239> I<00:04:20.299> didn't<00:04:20.510> have<00:04:20.630> the

00:04:20.650 --> 00:04:20.660 
flap them in because I didn't have the

00:04:20.660 --> 00:04:24.010 
flap them in because I didn't have the
right<00:04:20.840> kind<00:04:20.900> of<00:04:21.169> tool<00:04:21.880> so<00:04:22.880> being<00:04:23.870> the

00:04:24.010 --> 00:04:24.020 
right kind of tool so being the

00:04:24.020 --> 00:04:27.430 
right kind of tool so being the
innovator<00:04:24.260> that<00:04:24.620> I<00:04:24.710> am<00:04:24.830> or<00:04:26.260> necessities<00:04:27.260> and

00:04:27.430 --> 00:04:27.440 
innovator that I am or necessities and

00:04:27.440 --> 00:04:29.620 
innovator that I am or necessities and
mother<00:04:27.590> haven't<00:04:27.800> mentioned<00:04:28.190> use<00:04:29.150> my<00:04:29.330> cordless

00:04:29.620 --> 00:04:29.630 
mother haven't mentioned use my cordless

00:04:29.630 --> 00:04:36.820 
mother haven't mentioned use my cordless
drill<00:04:30.020> and<00:04:31.000> a<00:04:32.110> tire<00:04:33.110> valve<00:04:33.979> stem<00:04:35.380> so<00:04:36.380> the<00:04:36.680> one

00:04:36.820 --> 00:04:36.830 
drill and a tire valve stem so the one

00:04:36.830 --> 00:04:38.080 
drill and a tire valve stem so the one
end<00:04:37.010> of<00:04:37.070> it<00:04:37.190> where<00:04:37.340> you<00:04:37.400> put<00:04:37.580> the<00:04:37.669> air<00:04:37.820> in<00:04:37.850> his

00:04:38.080 --> 00:04:38.090 
end of it where you put the air in his

00:04:38.090 --> 00:04:40.000 
end of it where you put the air in his
metal<00:04:38.360> so<00:04:38.660> it<00:04:38.780> chucked<00:04:39.020> up<00:04:39.200> to<00:04:39.320> the<00:04:39.440> drill<00:04:39.710> and

00:04:40.000 --> 00:04:40.010 
metal so it chucked up to the drill and

00:04:40.010 --> 00:04:41.800 
metal so it chucked up to the drill and
the<00:04:40.130> other<00:04:40.340> end<00:04:40.580> the<00:04:40.820> little<00:04:41.060> ball<00:04:41.270> bin<00:04:41.510> of<00:04:41.660> its

00:04:41.800 --> 00:04:41.810 
the other end the little ball bin of its

00:04:41.810 --> 00:04:46.210 
the other end the little ball bin of its
rubber<00:04:42.110> and<00:04:43.210> still<00:04:44.210> wanted<00:04:44.479> a<00:04:44.570> spin<00:04:44.960> I<00:04:45.289> didn't

00:04:46.210 --> 00:04:46.220 
rubber and still wanted a spin I didn't

00:04:46.220 --> 00:04:48.400 
rubber and still wanted a spin I didn't
want<00:04:46.370> to<00:04:46.460> spin<00:04:47.240> the<00:04:47.360> valves<00:04:47.690> right<00:04:47.930> so<00:04:48.139> I<00:04:48.169> just

00:04:48.400 --> 00:04:48.410 
want to spin the valves right so I just

00:04:48.410 --> 00:04:51.600 
want to spin the valves right so I just
took<00:04:48.530> a<00:04:48.650> little<00:04:48.800> a<00:04:49.510> razor<00:04:50.510> blade<00:04:50.750> and<00:04:50.900> put<00:04:51.200> some

00:04:51.600 --> 00:04:51.610 
took a little a razor blade and put some

00:04:51.610 --> 00:04:55.240 
took a little a razor blade and put some
cuts<00:04:52.610> in<00:04:52.960> the<00:04:53.960> rubber<00:04:54.169> to<00:04:54.770> kind<00:04:54.950> of<00:04:55.010> give<00:04:55.130> it<00:04:55.220> a

00:04:55.240 --> 00:04:55.250 
cuts in the rubber to kind of give it a

00:04:55.250 --> 00:04:58.820 
cuts in the rubber to kind of give it a
bite<00:04:56.080> so

00:04:58.820 --> 00:04:58.830 
bite so

00:04:58.830 --> 00:05:05.150 
bite so
I<00:05:01.250> can't<00:05:02.250> do<00:05:02.370> this<00:05:02.460> one-handed<00:05:03.830> they<00:05:04.830> fit<00:05:05.070> in

00:05:05.150 --> 00:05:05.160 
I can't do this one-handed they fit in

00:05:05.160 --> 00:05:06.890 
I can't do this one-handed they fit in
there<00:05:05.310> pretty<00:05:05.490> snug<00:05:05.610> so<00:05:06.600> you<00:05:06.660> get<00:05:06.810> them

00:05:06.890 --> 00:05:06.900 
there pretty snug so you get them

00:05:06.900 --> 00:05:10.850 
there pretty snug so you get them
started<00:05:07.430> let<00:05:08.430> me<00:05:08.460> see<00:05:08.700> if<00:05:08.760> I<00:05:08.850> can<00:05:09.380> put<00:05:10.380> the<00:05:10.530> foot

00:05:10.850 --> 00:05:10.860 
started let me see if I can put the foot

00:05:10.860 --> 00:05:12.950 
started let me see if I can put the foot
the<00:05:11.040> camera<00:05:11.430> under<00:05:11.700> my<00:05:11.850> arm<00:05:12.060> all<00:05:12.630> that<00:05:12.780> ain't

00:05:12.950 --> 00:05:12.960 
the camera under my arm all that ain't

00:05:12.960 --> 00:05:16.010 
the camera under my arm all that ain't
gonna<00:05:13.050> work<00:05:13.140> I<00:05:14.120> really<00:05:15.120> need<00:05:15.270> a<00:05:15.300> camera<00:05:15.630> person

00:05:16.010 --> 00:05:16.020 
gonna work I really need a camera person

00:05:16.020 --> 00:05:23.150 
gonna work I really need a camera person
I<00:05:16.410> really<00:05:17.340> do<00:05:20.330> let<00:05:21.330> me<00:05:21.360> see<00:05:21.570> let<00:05:21.750> me<00:05:22.040> hang<00:05:23.040> on

I really do let me see let me hang on
standby<00:05:23.490> let<00:05:23.820> me<00:05:23.880> get<00:05:24.030> it<00:05:24.120> started<00:05:46.850> then

00:05:49.330 --> 00:05:49.340 
standby let me get it started then

00:05:49.340 --> 00:05:52.070 
standby let me get it started then
anyway<00:05:50.340> the<00:05:50.970> idea<00:05:51.270> is<00:05:51.330> you<00:05:51.450> take<00:05:51.480> you<00:05:51.900> take

00:05:52.070 --> 00:05:52.080 
anyway the idea is you take you take

00:05:52.080 --> 00:05:55.310 
anyway the idea is you take you take
that<00:05:53.030> you<00:05:54.030> spin<00:05:54.360> your<00:05:54.480> drill<00:05:54.780> and<00:05:55.080> then<00:05:55.140> with

00:05:55.310 --> 00:05:55.320 
that you spin your drill and then with

00:05:55.320 --> 00:05:57.250 
that you spin your drill and then with
your<00:05:55.410> other<00:05:55.620> hand<00:05:55.710> you<00:05:56.190> go<00:05:56.370> from<00:05:56.610> underneath

00:05:57.250 --> 00:05:57.260 
your other hand you go from underneath

00:05:57.260 --> 00:06:02.090 
your other hand you go from underneath
and<00:05:58.260> you<00:05:58.890> work<00:05:59.070> the<00:05:59.100> valve<00:05:59.460> open<00:06:00.060> and<00:06:00.150> close<00:06:01.100> up

00:06:02.090 --> 00:06:02.100 
and you work the valve open and close up

00:06:02.100 --> 00:06:06.230 
and you work the valve open and close up
and<00:06:02.250> down<00:06:02.460> and<00:06:04.310> you<00:06:05.310> do<00:06:05.460> that<00:06:05.640> for<00:06:05.880> a<00:06:06.030> little

00:06:06.230 --> 00:06:06.240 
and down and you do that for a little

00:06:06.240 --> 00:06:08.900 
and down and you do that for a little
bit<00:06:06.890> pull<00:06:07.890> it<00:06:08.010> out<00:06:08.130> check<00:06:08.430> it<00:06:08.460> check<00:06:08.730> your
