00:00:00.660 --> 00:00:05.399
 or the ladies of artists 

00:00:02.520 --> 00:00:07.880
 international nail for here 

00:00:05.399 --> 00:00:10.260
 clarifying doubts that have 

00:00:07.880 --> 00:00:12.750
 tutorial 

00:00:10.260 --> 00:00:15.630
 and how to make them one of the images to 

00:00:12.750 --> 00:00:19.080
 with your mind they are metallic I do it 

00:00:15.630 --> 00:00:20.810
 with this paper that is a paper it was good 

00:00:19.080 --> 00:00:24.150
 the bone and how do I do it quickly 

00:00:20.810 --> 00:00:26.700
 first we make our where with the 

00:00:24.150 --> 00:00:29.490
 technique that you occupy but has 

00:00:26.700 --> 00:00:31.740
 that look good parejita from above 

00:00:29.490 --> 00:00:34.140
 because why did he go and we 

00:00:31.740 --> 00:00:37.020
 be matched we should have good for 

00:00:34.140 --> 00:00:39.750
 that our surface comes out with here them 

00:00:37.020 --> 00:00:41.460
 I show mine I made it in acrylic 

00:00:39.750 --> 00:00:45.000
 crystal is encapsulated the one already 

00:00:41.460 --> 00:00:47.250
 has hardness and everything comes out then what 

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:49.739
 let's do can they shine or 

00:00:47.250 --> 00:00:51.890
 encapsulated any glaze I 'll 

00:00:49.739 --> 00:00:55.340
 to put this enamel 

00:00:51.890 --> 00:00:58.040
 because I like this background that really 

00:00:55.340 --> 00:01:02.870
 can not be seen can put any type 

00:00:58.040 --> 00:01:04.430
 of enamel to anchor goes out and we go to 

00:01:02.870 --> 00:01:06.350
 wait for it to dry a little 

00:01:04.430 --> 00:01:09.080
 how many seconds 

00:01:06.350 --> 00:01:12.189
 because on this we are going to apply 

00:01:09.080 --> 00:01:12.189
 our folk 

00:01:12.900 --> 00:01:18.930
 and it will look good out pretty parejito 

00:01:16.920 --> 00:01:22.680
 I show you nothing but start 

00:01:18.930 --> 00:01:24.810
 drying there is still very wet but 

00:01:22.680 --> 00:01:27.590
 If you are still not very cool film 

00:01:24.810 --> 00:01:27.590
 adhiere parejito 

00:01:29.250 --> 00:01:39.860
 I hope you like my YouTube video 

00:01:36.090 --> 00:01:39.860
 from jota canellis del face 

00:01:39.900 --> 00:01:48.410
 we are going to follow you, it is drying a little 

00:01:43.410 --> 00:01:48.410
 what we do is apply the folio 

00:01:50.180 --> 00:01:54.609
 press 

00:01:52.659 --> 00:01:57.270
 they have to be I repeat them well 

00:01:54.609 --> 00:01:57.270
 small 

00:02:00.340 --> 00:02:04.810
 I do not stay the same because I do not 

00:02:02.710 --> 00:02:08.429
 let dry well but do not believe 

00:02:04.810 --> 00:02:08.429
 nothing simply 

00:02:09.280 --> 00:02:16.020
 we apply where there is a hole because 

00:02:12.640 --> 00:02:16.020
 obviously where there are holes 

00:02:19.980 --> 00:02:23.599
 where is he going as a couple 

00:02:26.290 --> 00:02:32.540
 and until here 

00:02:28.530 --> 00:02:35.150
 and we go super super good 

00:02:32.540 --> 00:02:38.000
 if he lacked somewhere 

00:02:35.150 --> 00:02:42.069
 as in this case he lacked a little bit in the 

00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:44.900
 but if you can see well 

00:02:42.069 --> 00:02:47.680
 what I do is reapply the 

00:02:44.900 --> 00:02:47.680
 nothing more enamel 

00:02:48.960 --> 00:02:52.620
 where you have some kind of 

00:02:50.700 --> 00:02:55.670
 small 

00:02:52.620 --> 00:03:00.370
 It is a very thin layer 

00:02:55.670 --> 00:03:00.370
 and then we can apply the layers that 

00:03:01.730 --> 00:03:07.180
 apply it 

00:03:03.800 --> 00:03:07.180
 well skinny 

00:03:08.060 --> 00:03:14.910
 or do it from a single as you can 

00:03:11.390 --> 00:03:17.550
 apply two layers or as many as you want 

00:03:14.910 --> 00:03:20.820
 and to give that finished like the one you 

00:03:17.550 --> 00:03:25.070
 shows in the picture what I do is 

00:03:20.820 --> 00:03:25.070
 simply apply your lamp shell 

00:03:28.690 --> 00:03:31.860
 making time and what was that 

00:03:30.280 --> 00:03:34.280
 short 

00:03:31.860 --> 00:03:37.700
 come in shape 

00:03:34.280 --> 00:03:40.060
 since it is drying I will adhere to my 

00:03:37.700 --> 00:03:40.060
 hoyle 

00:03:51.410 --> 00:03:55.060
 look, this left me more parsley 

00:04:01.390 --> 00:04:09.450
 look at that pretty even if you 

00:04:04.180 --> 00:04:09.450
 they fix here on the paper where it's left 

00:04:10.860 --> 00:04:17.290
 I hope you reach to appreciate 

00:04:13.690 --> 00:04:18.660
 as it looks good and very metallic 

00:04:17.290 --> 00:04:23.580
 comes out 

00:04:18.660 --> 00:04:26.220
 and nothing else to give the effect that you 

00:04:23.580 --> 00:04:28.159
 give in the photo because what we do is 

00:04:26.220 --> 00:04:30.350
 Apply 

00:04:28.159 --> 00:04:34.310
 our 

00:04:30.350 --> 00:04:37.030
 finish or gel lamp as you want 

00:04:34.310 --> 00:04:37.030
 call him 

00:04:38.380 --> 00:04:42.930
 I love how it looks like this with this 

00:04:43.210 --> 00:04:48.220
 when nothing else asks you in tip 

00:04:45.940 --> 00:04:51.320
 benefit what you do to not complicate 

00:04:48.220 --> 00:04:56.500
 so much is this 

00:04:51.320 --> 00:04:56.500
 put metal tips high I show you 

00:05:02.009 --> 00:05:10.430
 good in several colors would be these 

00:05:07.070 --> 00:05:12.710
 they are very metallic they also do not cost 

00:05:10.430 --> 00:05:15.710
 these cost expensive casitas good 

00:05:12.710 --> 00:05:19.200
 mexican cost 30 pesos 

00:05:15.710 --> 00:05:23.180
 these are silver but if they are fixed it is 

00:05:19.200 --> 00:05:23.180
 the metal effect 

00:05:23.600 --> 00:05:28.969
 and then my LED lamps only of these 

00:05:26.570 --> 00:05:32.979
 30 seconds 

00:05:28.969 --> 00:05:32.979
 and ready 

00:05:34.169 --> 00:05:40.169
 I hope you like it I hope they reach 

00:05:38.039 --> 00:05:46.069
 let's see 

00:05:40.169 --> 00:05:46.069
