 "Golden Dragon Looks Back" (Hands Horse) &lt;Verbatped Draft: Li Mingjuan's Manuscript: Li Tanku&gt; 

00:00:15.100 --> 00:00:21.520
 What we are going to teach in this lesson is the "Golden Dragon Review" around the foot. I will demonstrate it directly now. 

00:00:21.540 --> 00:00:23.260
 Action demonstration 

00:00:32.460 --> 00:00:34.320
 Slow motion demonstration 

00:00:38.380 --> 00:00:42.820
 1. The height of the bell thrown to the shoulder 

00:00:42.900 --> 00:00:46.460
 Throw up "hook" 

00:00:46.640 --> 00:00:51.460
 When you come to the left and your head is facing forward, it will become an empty bell. 

00:00:51.460 --> 00:00:53.700
 3. Pull the bell out of the hand 

00:00:53.700 --> 00:00:55.960
 After the bell is offline, the hand comes back to the foot. 

00:01:02.640 --> 00:01:06.780
 1. throw up the "hook" 

00:01:06.780 --> 00:01:12.500
 2. When you come to the left, the club heads are facing forward and it will become an empty bell. 

00:01:12.500 --> 00:01:15.620
 3. Pull the bell out of the hand 

00:01:15.620 --> 00:01:19.100
 4. After the bell is offline, the hand comes back to the foot. 

00:01:21.060 --> 00:01:23.900
 Basic work 

00:01:24.060 --> 00:01:25.620
 Basic skill 1: check the crossbow 

00:01:25.720 --> 00:01:42.220
 To slap a crossbow, you must first learn to "tick" and then cross the bell to bounce. This action is also called "check the crossbow." 

00:01:42.220 --> 00:01:49.220
 Basic skill 2: throwing around the foot to the shoulder 

00:01:49.320 --> 00:01:56.980
 The height of the bell can be thrown to the shoulder after the foot 

00:01:57.080 --> 00:02:02.540
 When you want to "throw your feet to the shoulders" and practice very well, when you practice this action, your hooks can be beautiful. 

00:02:02.700 --> 00:02:09.540
 If your ringing is too high, or you can't throw it, your right hand will become difficult to hook and it will be very difficult. 

00:02:10.240 --> 00:02:12.160
 Decomposition teaching 

00:02:12.240 --> 00:02:15.660
 The first step: you will "hook", then you have to ask for another kind of check 

00:02:15.660 --> 00:02:28.240
 The general "tick" we will let the line slide down, but now we have to make your line hook on the stick. 

00:02:28.420 --> 00:02:37.860
 Step 2: After hooking on the stick, then the bell will come over, it will become two hands crossed, then the bell will become empty 

00:02:37.860 --> 00:02:43.200
 At this time, I am playing up and coming back to catch. The second step is to get this practice. 

00:03:02.720 --> 00:03:11.320
 When you have already practiced this exercise very well, we have to go straight into the foot and start doing it. 

00:03:11.320 --> 00:03:14.900
 After the foot, this action is very similar, there is no difference. 

00:03:14.900 --> 00:03:24.940
 The first step: you must first do the hooking action, when the bell is ringing, the throwing bell throws the hook, remember that it can not be thrown too high. 

00:03:25.520 --> 00:03:32.580
 Step 2: Hang on the stick when you come over, and both sticks are facing forward. 

00:03:32.580 --> 00:03:38.460
 The third step: After the bell is an empty bell, the hand pulls out and lets the bell fly up, and the hand comes back to catch it. 

00:03:40.100 --> 00:03:42.100
 Common mistakes 

00:03:43.060 --> 00:03:47.380
 The first common mistake is that the bell is too high and it is difficult to ring. 

00:03:47.380 --> 00:03:55.240
 This action, the bell is very important, if the bell is thrown high, it will be difficult to hook, it will be very difficult to become hooked. 

00:03:55.240 --> 00:04:02.160
 So the height of the shoulder is good, just throw it to this height, and you will be hooked when you hook it. 

00:04:02.300 --> 00:04:09.860
 Common mistakes 2. The hand is too early to come back to the line to the bell 

00:04:10.060 --> 00:04:14.740
 When the bell is hung on the stick, when you want to throw it up, you must remember to "think that the bell has been thrown up" and the hand can come back. 

00:04:14.740 --> 00:04:19.640
 Many students will come back, oh! Pulled back and returned to the line. 

00:04:19.640 --> 00:04:23.940
 When you throw it, you must pull your hands out. "Make sure the bell is flying high." 

00:04:23.940 --> 00:04:27.200
 Extended action 

00:04:27.200 --> 00:04:33.220
 Usually throwing up two practices, I will demonstrate. 

00:04:33.220 --> 00:04:40.100
 Some people will get used to it, after the hook is finished, the stick heads forward and the bell flies up from here. 

00:04:40.100 --> 00:04:48.940
 Some people will get used to hanging, and the bell will fly from the inside. Can, look at personal habits. 

00:04:49.800 --> 00:04:53.900
 Thrown from "outside" 

00:04:54.200 --> 00:04:58.260
 Thrown from "inside" 

00:04:58.440 --> 00:05:06.920
 After the "Golden Dragons Come Back" meeting, we will teach another "sea fishing moon" in the next season. 

00:05:06.920 --> 00:05:12.820
 Extension 3: thrown behind 

00:05:12.860 --> 00:05:26.080
 Extension 4: Other combinations 

00:05:27.220 --> 00:05:28.860
