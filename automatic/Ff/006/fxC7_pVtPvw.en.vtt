perch<00:00:39.920> I<00:00:40.129> think<00:00:40.309> that's<00:00:40.460> really<00:00:40.699> best<00:00:41.330> spent

00:00:42.310 --> 00:00:42.320 
perch I think that's really best spent

00:00:42.320 --> 00:00:44.950 
perch I think that's really best spent
on<00:00:42.619> higher<00:00:43.339> level<00:00:43.699> weapons<00:00:44.059> and<00:00:44.360> higher<00:00:44.629> level

00:00:44.950 --> 00:00:44.960 
on higher level weapons and higher level

00:00:44.960 --> 00:00:47.289 
on higher level weapons and higher level
parts<00:00:45.320> and<00:00:45.500> armor<00:00:45.769> parts<00:00:46.100> around<00:00:46.339> level<00:00:46.640> 25<00:00:47.030> to

00:00:47.289 --> 00:00:47.299 
parts and armor parts around level 25 to

00:00:47.299 --> 00:00:49.930 
parts and armor parts around level 25 to
30<00:00:47.600> and<00:00:47.869> beyond<00:00:48.440> so<00:00:49.159> ultimately<00:00:49.489> I<00:00:49.909> think

00:00:49.930 --> 00:00:49.940 
30 and beyond so ultimately I think

00:00:49.940 --> 00:00:51.579 
30 and beyond so ultimately I think
tactical<00:00:50.510> gear<00:00:50.659> is<00:00:50.780> a<00:00:50.809> safe<00:00:51.019> choice<00:00:51.049> go<00:00:51.470> with

00:00:51.579 --> 00:00:51.589 
tactical gear is a safe choice go with

00:00:51.589 --> 00:00:53.530 
tactical gear is a safe choice go with
the<00:00:51.710> med<00:00:51.890> kit<00:00:52.100> you<00:00:52.670> can<00:00:52.820> give<00:00:52.940> you<00:00:53.059> some<00:00:53.210> give

00:00:53.530 --> 00:00:53.540 
the med kit you can give you some give

00:00:53.540 --> 00:00:55.359 
the med kit you can give you some give
yourself<00:00:53.809> some<00:00:53.839> emergency<00:00:54.500> health<00:00:54.769> when<00:00:55.250> you

00:00:55.359 --> 00:00:55.369 
yourself some emergency health when you

00:00:55.369 --> 00:00:57.820 
yourself some emergency health when you
really<00:00:55.670> need<00:00:55.850> it<00:00:56.030> um<00:00:56.650> ultimately<00:00:57.650> I<00:00:57.769> think

00:00:57.820 --> 00:00:57.830 
really need it um ultimately I think

00:00:57.830 --> 00:00:59.500 
really need it um ultimately I think
that's<00:00:58.070> kind<00:00:58.250> of<00:00:58.280> a<00:00:58.400> wise<00:00:58.580> decision<00:00:58.610> or<00:00:59.390> you

00:00:59.500 --> 00:00:59.510 
that's kind of a wise decision or you

00:00:59.510 --> 00:01:01.329 
that's kind of a wise decision or you
can<00:00:59.600> ultimately<00:00:59.750> just<00:01:00.260> keep<00:01:00.619> saving<00:01:00.920> your<00:01:01.040> GP

00:01:01.329 --> 00:01:01.339 
can ultimately just keep saving your GP

00:01:01.339 --> 00:01:03.250 
can ultimately just keep saving your GP
I<00:01:01.369> think<00:01:01.699> there's<00:01:02.299> a<00:01:02.360> fault<00:01:02.629> gear<00:01:02.900> the<00:01:03.080> follow

00:01:03.250 --> 00:01:03.260 
I think there's a fault gear the follow

00:01:03.260 --> 00:01:06.130 
I think there's a fault gear the follow
up<00:01:03.379> is<00:01:03.559> still<00:01:03.920> viable<00:01:04.159> for<00:01:05.089> a<00:01:05.119> long<00:01:05.420> time<00:01:05.720> up<00:01:06.020> to

00:01:06.130 --> 00:01:06.140 
up is still viable for a long time up to

00:01:06.140 --> 00:01:08.529 
up is still viable for a long time up to
level<00:01:06.260> 20<00:01:06.619> to<00:01:06.740> 25<00:01:07.159> so<00:01:07.729> I<00:01:07.760> think<00:01:07.850> that's<00:01:08.030> still<00:01:08.299> a

00:01:08.529 --> 00:01:08.539 
level 20 to 25 so I think that's still a

00:01:08.539 --> 00:01:10.270 
level 20 to 25 so I think that's still a
good<00:01:08.750> choice<00:01:08.960> to<00:01:08.990> just<00:01:09.500> save<00:01:09.679> your<00:01:09.799> money<00:01:10.009> and

00:01:10.270 --> 00:01:10.280 
good choice to just save your money and

00:01:10.280 --> 00:01:11.859 
good choice to just save your money and
kind<00:01:10.909> of<00:01:10.969> see<00:01:11.090> what<00:01:11.210> other<00:01:11.329> people<00:01:11.630> are<00:01:11.689> using

00:01:11.859 --> 00:01:11.869 
kind of see what other people are using

00:01:11.869 --> 00:01:14.109 
kind of see what other people are using
what's<00:01:12.140> more<00:01:12.320> effective<00:01:12.679> for<00:01:12.710> them<00:01:12.979> so<00:01:13.700> for

00:01:55.100 --> 00:01:57.160 
game close quarters medium-range
long-range<00:01:55.729> so<00:01:56.420> really<00:01:56.659> what<00:01:56.780> you<00:01:56.869> want<00:01:57.049> to<00:01:57.109> do

00:01:57.160 --> 00:01:57.170 
long-range so really what you want to do

00:01:57.170 --> 00:01:58.719 
long-range so really what you want to do
is<00:01:57.259> want<00:01:57.439> to<00:01:57.530> force<00:01:57.770> them<00:01:57.979> to<00:01:58.009> kind<00:01:58.369> of<00:01:58.429> use

00:01:58.719 --> 00:01:58.729 
is want to force them to kind of use

00:01:58.729 --> 00:02:01.449 
is want to force them to kind of use
their<00:01:58.939> bullets<00:01:59.299> why<00:01:59.990> because<00:02:00.679> after<00:02:01.159> a<00:02:01.189> while

00:02:01.449 --> 00:02:01.459 
their bullets why because after a while

00:02:01.459 --> 00:02:02.919 
their bullets why because after a while
when<00:02:01.729> they<00:02:01.819> shoot<00:02:01.880> if<00:02:02.299> they're<00:02:02.539> not<00:02:02.659> tap

00:02:02.919 --> 00:02:02.929 
when they shoot if they're not tap

00:02:02.929 --> 00:02:05.559 
when they shoot if they're not tap
firing<00:02:03.170> the<00:02:03.950> recall<00:02:04.249> is<00:02:04.310> gonna<00:02:04.429> really<00:02:04.729> cause

00:02:05.559 --> 00:02:05.569 
firing the recall is gonna really cause

00:02:05.569 --> 00:02:07.929 
firing the recall is gonna really cause
an<00:02:05.810> issue<00:02:05.929> for<00:02:06.049> them<00:02:06.350> so<00:02:06.829> after<00:02:07.549> a<00:02:07.579> while<00:02:07.639> it's

00:02:07.929 --> 00:02:07.939 
an issue for them so after a while it's

00:02:07.939 --> 00:02:09.100 
an issue for them so after a while it's
just<00:02:07.969> going<00:02:08.179> to<00:02:08.209> be<00:02:08.270> really<00:02:08.479> uncontrollable

00:02:09.100 --> 00:02:09.110 
just going to be really uncontrollable

00:02:09.110 --> 00:02:11.230 
just going to be really uncontrollable
and<00:02:09.200> feasible<00:02:09.709> for<00:02:09.920> them<00:02:09.979> to<00:02:10.280> really<00:02:10.520> get

00:02:11.230 --> 00:02:11.240 
and feasible for them to really get

00:02:11.240 --> 00:02:13.600 
and feasible for them to really get
after<00:02:11.420> you<00:02:11.660> and<00:02:11.959> hit<00:02:12.080> you<00:02:12.110> consistently<00:02:12.890> so<00:02:13.400> it

00:02:13.600 --> 00:02:13.610 
after you and hit you consistently so it

00:02:13.610 --> 00:02:16.090 
after you and hit you consistently so it
forces<00:02:14.330> them<00:02:14.390> to<00:02:14.450> go<00:02:14.690> from<00:02:15.200> full<00:02:15.500> automatic<00:02:15.830> to

00:02:16.090 --> 00:02:16.100 
forces them to go from full automatic to

00:02:16.100 --> 00:02:18.230 
forces them to go from full automatic to
tap<00:02:16.310> fire<00:02:16.580> or<00:02:17.240> put<00:02:17.480> some<00:02:17.600> in<00:02:17.720> an<00:02:17.780> uncomfortable

00:02:18.230 --> 00:02:18.240 
tap fire or put some in an uncomfortable

00:02:18.240 --> 00:02:19.670 
tap fire or put some in an uncomfortable
position<00:02:18.750> and<00:02:18.930> that's<00:02:19.050> when<00:02:19.230> you<00:02:19.320> strike

00:02:19.670 --> 00:02:19.680 
position and that's when you strike

00:02:19.680 --> 00:02:21.140 
position and that's when you strike
whether<00:02:20.010> it's<00:02:20.220> close<00:02:20.610> quarters<00:02:20.640> or

00:07:06.300 --> 00:07:06.310 
target if it's far away so it gives you

00:07:06.310 --> 00:07:08.670 
target if it's far away so it gives you
a<00:07:06.340> good<00:07:06.460> like<00:07:07.060> chance<00:07:07.420> to<00:07:07.690> dodge<00:07:08.050> that<00:07:08.080> if<00:07:08.590> you

get near and then they're going to
detonate<00:07:14.350> it<00:07:14.710> so<00:07:14.920> definitely<00:07:15.310> shoot<00:07:16.120> that
