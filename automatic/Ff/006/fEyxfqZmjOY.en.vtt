00:00:00.140 --> 00:00:04.710
 there are such games that 

00:00:02.700 --> 00:00:07.140
 despite our frankly 

00:00:04.710 --> 00:00:09.450
 primitive concept is delayed and not 

00:00:07.140 --> 00:00:12.360
 lower hem would be today we are with you 

00:00:09.450 --> 00:00:13.950
 let's talk about this game to everyone 

00:00:12.360 --> 00:00:18.949
 hello and meet 

00:00:13.950 --> 00:00:18.949
 dogs game about connections went 

00:00:24.320 --> 00:00:29.070
 the idea of â€‹â€‹the game is not that original 

00:00:27.150 --> 00:00:31.620
 in fact, she is as old as the world 

00:00:29.070 --> 00:00:33.900
 all that is required of the players is 

00:00:31.620 --> 00:00:36.780
 combine points on the playing field in line 

00:00:33.900 --> 00:00:39.360
 for which he will earn points 

00:00:36.780 --> 00:00:41.190
 It's clear that time for everything about everything 

00:00:39.360 --> 00:00:44.340
 we are given strictly limited 

00:00:41.190 --> 00:00:46.800
 number exactly 60 seconds to player 

00:00:44.340 --> 00:00:49.350
 not relaxed especially de game sessions 

00:00:46.800 --> 00:00:52.620
 would not be burdensome in general 

00:00:49.350 --> 00:00:55.140
 what you need and so on the field size of 6 to 

00:00:52.620 --> 00:00:58.019
 6 randomly placed point 

00:00:55.140 --> 00:01:01.019
 4 colors purple and blue yellow and 

00:00:58.019 --> 00:01:02.339
 here are exactly the red ones we need 

00:01:01.019 --> 00:01:05.010
 line up 

00:01:02.339 --> 00:01:06.870
 points are awarded accordingly 

00:01:05.010 --> 00:01:08.159
 the short of the possible lines in two points 

00:01:06.870 --> 00:01:12.030
 add two points 

00:01:08.159 --> 00:01:13.530
 3 3 and so on but also if 

00:01:12.030 --> 00:01:16.650
 the field formed a square of four 

00:01:13.530 --> 00:01:18.659
 identical points then drop all your 

00:01:16.650 --> 00:01:21.330
 things if you connect all the dots in this 

00:01:18.659 --> 00:01:24.530
 the square then all objects will be deleted from the field 

00:01:21.330 --> 00:01:27.000
 one color and you get points for them and 

00:01:24.530 --> 00:01:29.040
 no doubt go away from all their 

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:31.080
 friends and rivals at the same time 

00:01:29.040 --> 00:01:31.800
 for example from twitter or facebook and 

00:01:31.080 --> 00:01:34.260
 any 

00:01:31.800 --> 00:01:36.330
 if you use it at all 

00:01:34.260 --> 00:01:38.780
 the kind of toy is simple, even probably not so 

00:01:36.330 --> 00:01:41.340
 he is not easy he is the quintessence 

00:01:38.780 --> 00:01:44.040
 minimalism in the design of the game is used 

00:01:41.340 --> 00:01:46.710
 minimum minimum rules minimum 

00:01:44.040 --> 00:01:49.080
 minimum sound graphics and it looks well 

00:01:46.710 --> 00:01:51.900
 at least in my opinion very and 

00:01:49.080 --> 00:01:53.940
 very cool and most importantly such 

00:01:51.900 --> 00:01:55.350
 developer approach does not harm 

00:01:53.940 --> 00:01:57.690
 game process 

00:01:55.350 --> 00:01:59.550
 the more you play dota the more 

00:01:57.690 --> 00:02:02.130
 trophies get really not quite 

00:01:59.550 --> 00:02:04.680
 it is clear what to do with them then but how 

00:02:02.130 --> 00:02:07.260
 not cool off the trophies you do not wriggle 

00:02:04.680 --> 00:02:09.000
 aside from this point are local 

00:02:07.260 --> 00:02:11.580
 currency, respectively, those points that 

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:14.550
 you have already combined in lines are being sent 

00:02:11.580 --> 00:02:17.099
 straight your wallet and why are they 

00:02:14.550 --> 00:02:20.610
 needed but now tell in the game there 

00:02:17.099 --> 00:02:23.670
 in-app purchases yes it's bad and 

00:02:20.610 --> 00:02:25.500
 ladies don't like it but this is probably the most 

00:02:23.670 --> 00:02:27.569
 a modest game in my memory which is not 

00:02:25.500 --> 00:02:30.390
 so as not to ask for anything there 

00:02:27.569 --> 00:02:33.040
 buy a breath and even vice versa more interesting 

00:02:30.390 --> 00:02:34.959
 play without bonuses bonuses by the way 

00:02:33.040 --> 00:02:37.120
 a lot just three pieces this 

00:02:34.959 --> 00:02:39.519
 adding 5 seconds to the time of the round 

00:02:37.120 --> 00:02:42.489
 removing a single point on the field by double 

00:02:39.519 --> 00:02:45.310
 tapu and remove all points of the same color 

00:02:42.489 --> 00:02:48.219
 Sometimes these bonuses are useful but 

00:02:45.310 --> 00:02:50.500
 most often flirting so just 

00:02:48.219 --> 00:02:53.049
 you simply forget about them and 

00:02:50.500 --> 00:02:54.819
 the cost of these bonuses is by the way not so 

00:02:53.049 --> 00:02:57.609
 too high to invest real 

00:02:54.819 --> 00:02:59.590
 money so don't worry your 

00:02:57.609 --> 00:03:03.219
 money will have to spend in some 

00:02:59.590 --> 00:03:05.500
 another greedy toy and yes for the game itself 

00:03:03.219 --> 00:03:08.019
 in the appstore, developers do not ask at all 

00:03:05.500 --> 00:03:10.480
 nothing so here just drive in 

00:03:08.019 --> 00:03:12.609
 search dots or scan qr-code on 

00:03:10.480 --> 00:03:15.069
 screen and the game after a few moments 

00:03:12.609 --> 00:03:17.560
 will already be on your iphone 

00:03:15.069 --> 00:03:19.870
 it weighs only 6 megabytes you 

00:03:17.560 --> 00:03:21.810
 just think 6 megabytes 

00:03:19.870 --> 00:03:23.590
 and that's all with you was Ilya Cossacks
