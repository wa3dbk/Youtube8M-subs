and<00:00:12.780> last<00:00:13.780> time<00:00:13.990> we<00:00:14.110> had<00:00:14.260> some<00:00:14.440> trouble<00:00:14.769> with

00:00:14.789 --> 00:00:14.799 
and last time we had some trouble with

00:00:14.799 --> 00:00:17.249 
and last time we had some trouble with
the<00:00:14.980> es<00:00:15.250> es<00:00:15.459> now<00:00:15.730> the<00:00:16.090> ESS<00:00:16.599> has<00:00:16.750> been<00:00:16.900> replaced

the es es now the ESS has been replaced
and<00:00:17.680> we<00:00:17.890> are<00:00:17.980> testing<00:00:18.279> it<00:00:18.400> again<00:00:18.640> here<00:00:18.849> today

00:00:19.140 --> 00:00:19.150 
and we are testing it again here today

00:00:19.150 --> 00:00:22.560 
and we are testing it again here today
and<00:00:19.599> see<00:00:19.779> how<00:00:19.869> it<00:00:20.020> behaves<00:00:20.610> it's<00:00:21.610> mild<00:00:22.119> windy

00:00:22.560 --> 00:00:22.570 
and see how it behaves it's mild windy

00:00:22.570 --> 00:00:35.140 
and see how it behaves it's mild windy
today<00:00:22.750> more<00:00:23.380> modest<00:00:23.800> ones<00:00:24.070> we<00:00:24.250> can<00:00:24.430> say

00:00:35.140 --> 00:00:35.150 

00:00:35.150 --> 00:00:39.750 

using<00:00:35.450> a<00:00:35.540> 4000mah<00:00:36.350> battery<00:00:36.560> pack

00:00:39.750 --> 00:00:39.760 

00:00:39.760 --> 00:00:43.370 

and<00:00:39.879> I<00:00:40.090> have<00:00:40.329> not<00:00:40.570> got<00:00:40.929> any<00:00:41.140> friends<00:00:41.530> yet

00:00:43.370 --> 00:00:43.380 
and I have not got any friends yet

00:00:43.380 --> 00:00:48.150 
and I have not got any friends yet
yeah<00:00:43.920> we<00:00:44.100> have<00:00:44.250> more<00:00:44.400> wins<00:00:44.670> in<00:00:45.180> this<00:00:45.450> area

00:00:48.150 --> 00:00:48.160 

00:00:48.160 --> 00:00:54.520 

here<00:00:48.700> so<00:00:48.940> camera<00:00:49.300> can<00:00:49.480> see<00:00:49.690> it's<00:00:49.840> clear

00:00:54.520 --> 00:00:54.530 

00:00:54.530 --> 00:00:57.680 

basically<00:00:55.530> keep<00:00:56.400> I'm<00:00:56.580> a<00:00:56.610> little<00:00:57.000> Club<00:00:57.240> handles

00:00:57.680 --> 00:00:57.690 
basically keep I'm a little Club handles

00:00:57.690 --> 00:01:02.140 
basically keep I'm a little Club handles
wins<00:00:58.320> very<00:00:58.710> well

00:01:02.140 --> 00:01:02.150 

00:01:02.150 --> 00:01:23.950 

I<00:01:02.210> mean<00:01:02.840> it<00:01:03.050> can<00:01:03.230> fly<00:01:03.440> in<00:01:03.650> the<00:01:03.740> wind

00:01:23.950 --> 00:01:23.960 

00:01:23.960 --> 00:01:27.819 

see<00:01:24.960> how<00:01:25.110> it<00:01:25.290> connects<00:01:25.649> I<00:01:25.979> mean<00:01:26.520> how<00:01:26.820> the

00:01:27.819 --> 00:01:27.829 
see how it connects I mean how the

00:01:27.829 --> 00:01:38.260 
see how it connects I mean how the
picture<00:01:28.829> from<00:01:29.070> the<00:01:29.130> air<00:01:29.399> looks<00:01:29.729> like

00:01:38.260 --> 00:01:38.270 

00:01:38.270 --> 00:01:40.719 

handling<00:01:38.869> is<00:01:39.020> very<00:01:39.259> good<00:01:39.530> very<00:01:40.039> stable<00:01:40.460> it's

00:01:40.719 --> 00:01:40.729 
handling is very good very stable it's

00:01:40.729 --> 00:01:42.910 
handling is very good very stable it's
drifting<00:01:41.179> away<00:01:41.270> due<00:01:41.600> to<00:01:41.630> win<00:01:41.960> but<00:01:42.679> basically

00:01:42.910 --> 00:01:42.920 
drifting away due to win but basically

00:01:42.920 --> 00:02:03.180 
drifting away due to win but basically
the<00:01:43.909> altitude<00:01:44.390> hold<00:01:44.600> is<00:01:44.840> very<00:01:45.049> very<00:01:45.229> good

00:02:03.180 --> 00:02:03.190 

00:02:03.190 --> 00:02:06.200 

very<00:02:03.880> stable

00:02:06.200 --> 00:02:06.210 
very stable

00:02:06.210 --> 00:02:10.100 
very stable
and<00:02:06.690> I'm<00:02:06.900> liking<00:02:07.290> it<00:02:07.520> ki<00:02:08.520> 580<00:02:09.119> people<00:02:09.750> US<00:02:09.810> has

00:02:10.100 --> 00:02:10.110 
and I'm liking it ki 580 people US has

00:02:10.110 --> 00:02:13.400 
and I'm liking it ki 580 people US has
more<00:02:10.530> payload<00:02:11.130> capacity<00:02:11.910> I<00:02:12.150> have<00:02:12.810> flown<00:02:13.170> it

00:02:13.400 --> 00:02:13.410 
more payload capacity I have flown it

00:02:13.410 --> 00:02:22.460 
more payload capacity I have flown it
for<00:02:13.850> 1.8<00:02:14.850> total<00:02:15.720> weight<00:02:15.959> last<00:02:16.260> time

00:02:22.460 --> 00:02:22.470 

00:02:22.470 --> 00:02:24.530 

there<00:02:23.070> are<00:02:23.190> little<00:02:23.340> wobbles<00:02:23.850> when<00:02:24.030> descending

00:02:24.530 --> 00:02:24.540 
there are little wobbles when descending

00:02:24.540 --> 00:02:29.780 
there are little wobbles when descending
but<00:02:25.470> those<00:02:26.130> are<00:02:26.370> part<00:02:26.670> of<00:02:26.820> quad<00:02:27.120> copters<00:02:28.790> until

00:02:29.780 --> 00:02:29.790 
but those are part of quad copters until

00:02:29.790 --> 00:02:31.910 
but those are part of quad copters until
now<00:02:29.910> I<00:02:29.940> can<00:02:30.270> see<00:02:30.510> handling<00:02:31.350> the<00:02:31.470> descent

00:02:31.910 --> 00:02:31.920 
now I can see handling the descent

00:02:31.920 --> 00:02:34.520 
now I can see handling the descent
descending<00:02:32.820> very<00:02:33.180> nicely<00:02:33.480> very<00:02:34.200> little

00:02:34.520 --> 00:02:34.530 
descending very nicely very little

00:02:34.530 --> 00:02:37.010 
descending very nicely very little
wobble<00:02:34.740> I<00:02:35.070> mean<00:02:35.850> barely<00:02:36.120> seen<00:02:36.540> we<00:02:36.810> can

00:02:37.010 --> 00:02:37.020 
wobble I mean barely seen we can

00:02:37.020 --> 00:02:39.410 
wobble I mean barely seen we can
actually<00:02:37.200> edit<00:02:38.160> the<00:02:38.490> videos<00:02:38.820> on<00:02:39.120> a<00:02:39.150> gopro

00:02:39.410 --> 00:02:39.420 
actually edit the videos on a gopro

00:02:39.420 --> 00:03:06.179 
actually edit the videos on a gopro
easily<00:02:40.230> or<00:02:40.500> maybe<00:02:40.710> use<00:02:40.890> more<00:02:41.220> frames

00:03:06.179 --> 00:03:06.189 

00:03:06.189 --> 00:03:09.339 

handling<00:03:07.189> is<00:03:07.340> really<00:03:07.700> really<00:03:07.879> nice<00:03:08.349> I'm

00:03:50.490 --> 00:03:50.500 
when the wind comes it drips a little

00:03:50.500 --> 00:03:53.300 
when the wind comes it drips a little
bit<00:03:50.620> but<00:03:51.370> if<00:03:51.549> there<00:03:51.730> is<00:03:51.849> no<00:03:52.000> wind<00:03:52.209> you<00:03:52.689> can<00:03:52.900> see

00:03:53.300 --> 00:03:53.310 
bit but if there is no wind you can see

00:03:53.310 --> 00:03:55.740 
bit but if there is no wind you can see
this<00:03:54.310> thing<00:03:54.579> is<00:03:54.700> really<00:03:54.939> really<00:03:55.239> nice<00:03:55.480> for

00:03:58.259 --> 00:03:58.269 
videos so you can see I have mounted the

00:03:58.269 --> 00:04:02.580 
videos so you can see I have mounted the

from<00:04:05.799> some<00:04:06.069> partial<00:04:06.579> stuff<00:04:07.049> I'm<00:04:08.049> going<00:04:08.590> to

00:04:08.729 --> 00:04:08.739 
from some partial stuff I'm going to

00:04:08.739 --> 00:04:11.039 
from some partial stuff I'm going to
mount<00:04:08.920> the<00:04:09.280> GoPro<00:04:09.670> on<00:04:09.730> it<00:04:10.000> later<00:04:10.150> and<00:04:10.510> see<00:04:11.019> if

00:04:11.039 --> 00:04:11.049 
mount the GoPro on it later and see if
