curled<00:00:34.320> it<00:00:34.590> to<00:00:34.770> give<00:00:35.070> it<00:00:35.190> that<00:00:35.219> extra<00:00:35.850> spunk

00:00:36.620 --> 00:00:36.630 
curled it to give it that extra spunk

00:00:36.630 --> 00:00:39.049 
curled it to give it that extra spunk
when<00:00:37.200> it's<00:00:37.350> straight<00:00:37.680> you<00:00:37.890> can<00:00:38.070> see<00:00:38.309> that<00:00:38.910> it's

00:00:39.049 --> 00:00:39.059 
when it's straight you can see that it's

00:00:39.059 --> 00:00:40.639

00:00:43.069 --> 00:00:43.079 
pieces straight you can see how long it

00:00:43.079 --> 00:00:45.770 
pieces straight you can see how long it
actually<00:00:43.379> is<00:00:43.530> so<00:00:43.559> curling<00:00:44.129> it<00:00:44.280> actually<00:00:45.059> gives

00:00:45.770 --> 00:00:45.780 
actually is so curling it actually gives

00:00:45.780 --> 00:00:47.750 
actually is so curling it actually gives
it<00:00:45.960> some<00:00:46.170> bounce<00:00:46.410> and<00:00:46.800> takes<00:00:47.100> the<00:00:47.250> length<00:00:47.430> up<00:00:47.670> a

00:00:47.750 --> 00:00:47.760 
it some bounce and takes the length up a

00:00:47.760 --> 00:00:50.060 
it some bounce and takes the length up a
little<00:00:47.940> bit<00:00:48.149> because<00:00:48.960> it's<00:00:49.320> human<00:00:49.620> hair<00:00:49.680> you

00:00:50.060 --> 00:00:50.070 
little bit because it's human hair you

00:00:50.070 --> 00:00:52.700 
little bit because it's human hair you
can<00:00:50.250> use<00:00:50.280> heat<00:00:51.000> tools<00:00:51.239> such<00:00:51.539> as<00:00:51.719> flat<00:00:51.989> irons<00:00:52.500> or

00:01:00.560 --> 00:01:00.570 
a big full curl and it comes in several

00:01:00.570 --> 00:01:02.630 
a big full curl and it comes in several
different<00:01:00.719> colors<00:01:01.170> but<00:01:01.920> if<00:01:02.010> you<00:01:02.129> have<00:01:02.340> a<00:01:02.370> color

different colors but if you have a color
that's<00:01:02.940> hard<00:01:03.210> to<00:01:03.359> match

00:01:03.920 --> 00:01:03.930 
that's hard to match

00:01:03.930 --> 00:01:05.719 
that's hard to match

deposit on to this hair and get an
absolute<00:01:09.150> exact<00:01:09.689> match<00:01:10.070> I'm<00:01:11.070> going<00:01:11.400> to<00:01:11.490> go

00:01:11.600 --> 00:01:11.610 
absolute exact match I'm going to go

00:01:11.610 --> 00:01:13.280 
absolute exact match I'm going to go
ahead<00:01:11.700> and<00:01:11.970> remove<00:01:12.119> it<00:01:12.510> so<00:01:12.689> you<00:01:12.780> can<00:01:12.900> see<00:01:13.110> what

ahead and remove it so you can see what
a<00:01:13.320> dramatic<00:01:13.560> difference<00:01:13.950> it<00:01:14.490> makes<00:01:16.939> I'll<00:01:17.939> just

00:01:18.140 --> 00:01:18.150 
a dramatic difference it makes I'll just

00:01:18.150 --> 00:01:24.429 
a dramatic difference it makes I'll just
undo<00:01:18.570> the<00:01:18.720> pressure<00:01:18.960> sensitive<00:01:19.470> Clips<00:01:19.740> here

00:01:28.880 --> 00:01:28.890 
and this is the hair I started with I

00:01:28.890 --> 00:01:31.190 
and this is the hair I started with I
added<00:01:29.549> some<00:01:29.759> curl<00:01:29.970> to<00:01:30.210> my<00:01:30.360> own<00:01:30.509> hair<00:01:30.810> since<00:01:31.079> it

00:01:31.190 --> 00:01:31.200 
added some curl to my own hair since it

00:01:31.200 --> 00:01:33.590 
added some curl to my own hair since it
is<00:01:31.320> such<00:01:31.590> a<00:01:31.619> short<00:01:31.979> length<00:01:32.549> I<00:01:32.850> really<00:01:33.360> wanted

00:01:33.590 --> 00:01:33.600 
is such a short length I really wanted

00:01:33.600 --> 00:01:35.870 
is such a short length I really wanted
it<00:01:33.750> to<00:01:33.780> blend<00:01:34.110> into<00:01:34.320> the<00:01:34.560> long<00:01:34.740> pieces<00:01:35.070> and<00:01:35.460> the

00:01:35.870 --> 00:01:35.880 
it to blend into the long pieces and the

00:01:35.880 --> 00:01:38.300 
it to blend into the long pieces and the
curling<00:01:36.299> actually<00:01:36.780> helps<00:01:37.350> that<00:01:37.439> sometimes<00:01:38.189> I

00:01:38.300 --> 00:01:38.310 
curling actually helps that sometimes I

00:01:38.310 --> 00:01:40.190 
curling actually helps that sometimes I
also<00:01:38.460> just<00:01:38.790> pull<00:01:39.090> back<00:01:39.119> the<00:01:39.479> two<00:01:39.659> little<00:01:39.869> sides

00:01:40.190 --> 00:01:40.200 
also just pull back the two little sides

00:01:40.200 --> 00:01:42.649 
also just pull back the two little sides
to<00:01:40.799> help<00:01:40.920> blend<00:01:41.310> it<00:01:41.460> into<00:01:41.670> the<00:01:42.060> long<00:01:42.390> long

00:01:42.649 --> 00:01:42.659 
to help blend it into the long long

00:01:42.659 --> 00:01:44.870 
to help blend it into the long long

00:01:59.180 --> 00:02:01.970 
hair I've prepped this hair and my hair
using<00:02:00.180> the<00:02:00.210> hi<00:02:00.450> elite<00:02:00.840> rod<00:02:01.110> to<00:02:01.500> create<00:02:01.830> the

00:02:01.970 --> 00:02:01.980 
using the hi elite rod to create the

00:02:01.980 --> 00:02:04.370 
using the hi elite rod to create the
same<00:02:02.250> curl<00:02:02.520> pattern<00:02:02.970> in<00:02:03.180> the<00:02:03.600> extensions<00:02:04.170> and

00:02:04.370 --> 00:02:04.380 
same curl pattern in the extensions and

00:02:04.380 --> 00:02:06.340 
same curl pattern in the extensions and
my<00:02:04.650> hair<00:02:04.890> so<00:02:05.160> it<00:02:05.190> really<00:02:05.670> helps<00:02:05.940> it<00:02:06.120> blend

00:02:06.340 --> 00:02:06.350 
my hair so it really helps it blend

00:02:06.350 --> 00:02:08.480 
my hair so it really helps it blend
especially<00:02:07.350> since<00:02:07.590> my<00:02:07.710> hair<00:02:07.920> is<00:02:07.950> so<00:02:08.250> short

00:02:08.480 --> 00:02:08.490 
especially since my hair is so short

00:02:08.490 --> 00:02:10.160 
especially since my hair is so short
it's<00:02:09.000> going<00:02:09.210> to<00:02:09.270> create<00:02:09.479> a<00:02:09.570> nice<00:02:09.810> seamless

00:02:10.160 --> 00:02:10.170 
it's going to create a nice seamless

00:02:10.170 --> 00:02:12.470 
it's going to create a nice seamless
effect<00:02:10.710> then<00:02:11.580> I<00:02:11.610> just<00:02:11.910> lay<00:02:12.180> out<00:02:12.330> the

00:02:12.470 --> 00:02:12.480 
effect then I just lay out the

00:02:12.480 --> 00:02:15.290 
effect then I just lay out the
extensions<00:02:13.080> in<00:02:13.260> order<00:02:13.530> by<00:02:13.710> size<00:02:13.950> there's<00:02:14.940> two
