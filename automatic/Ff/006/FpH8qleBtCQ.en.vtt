00:00:22.650 --> 00:00:29.060
 My goal tomorrow finally get started air 

00:00:26.490 --> 00:00:31.830

00:00:29.060 --> 00:00:32.369
 We want to be unbeatable 

00:00:31.830 --> 00:00:34.079
 let's see 

00:00:32.369 --> 00:00:35.910
 I feel very very well would 

00:00:34.079 --> 00:00:36.960
 maybe eat a bit white 

00:00:35.910 --> 00:00:38.340

00:00:36.960 --> 00:00:39.840
 it's really tomorrow tomorrow 

00:00:38.340 --> 00:00:42.800
 be there very early at 6 o'clock 

00:00:39.840 --> 00:00:44.610
 definitely means to stand at 45 on 

00:00:42.800 --> 00:00:46.170
 I do not need that much time 

00:00:44.610 --> 00:00:48.989
 but tomorrow you still want to 

00:00:46.170 --> 00:00:50.789
 be fit for being well rested 

00:00:48.989 --> 00:00:52.140
 be that reaction times then go 

00:00:50.789 --> 00:00:52.800
 extremely important I can tell you 

00:00:52.140 --> 00:00:54.770
 promise 

00:00:52.800 --> 00:00:57.090
 and you probably also know yourself 

00:00:54.770 --> 00:00:58.590
 and yes, in that case, I will 

00:00:57.090 --> 00:01:00.420
 Now make it on the way if it is 

00:00:58.590 --> 00:01:02.609
 to look for food and get back to bed 

00:01:00.420 --> 00:01:05.330
 lay and get in tomorrow morning then 

00:01:02.609 --> 00:01:07.799
 to be old again with the start 

00:01:05.330 --> 00:01:10.650
 The machine should get warm 

00:01:07.799 --> 00:01:11.460
 i'm good things i'm very fit i 

00:01:10.650 --> 00:01:13.500
 had thought it a bit 

00:01:11.460 --> 00:01:14.760
 Effortless though a few things 

00:01:13.500 --> 00:01:16.799
 really a bit more stressful 

00:01:14.760 --> 00:01:19.350
 Run as thought last time 

00:01:16.799 --> 00:01:23.670
 everything'm good and I'm satisfied 

00:01:19.350 --> 00:01:25.259
 Hotel has everything worked out so good 

00:01:23.670 --> 00:01:27.780
 the only fans came the family of 

00:01:25.259 --> 00:01:30.000
 therefore, everything is actually good 

00:01:27.780 --> 00:01:31.409
 So that's the small one 

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:32.759
 between advice from me I will, of course 

00:01:31.409 --> 00:01:34.619
 keep you up to date 

00:01:32.759 --> 00:01:36.030
 continue to hold and maybe 

00:01:34.619 --> 00:01:37.530
 Tomorrow because I'm fine then times 

00:01:36.030 --> 00:01:39.420
 look what we already have 

00:01:37.530 --> 00:01:42.119
 Taxi driver entertain me a few 

00:01:39.420 --> 00:01:43.380
 I then gave information 

00:01:42.119 --> 00:01:45.810
 I am not far away from downtown 

00:01:43.380 --> 00:01:48.000
 that will work then I am there 

00:01:45.810 --> 00:01:49.979
 otherwise at places of interest like museums 

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:51.149
 Let's see how I can take what 

00:01:49.979 --> 00:01:52.380
 I still can show and 

00:01:51.149 --> 00:01:52.909
 maybe what a funny few 

00:01:52.380 --> 00:01:55.170
 stuff 

00:01:52.909 --> 00:01:57.390
 the only thing even just now 

00:01:55.170 --> 00:01:58.710
 this is a field that everyone has been here for me 

00:01:57.390 --> 00:02:00.659
 in America as an American 

00:01:58.710 --> 00:02:02.310
 why should I look beautiful 

00:02:00.659 --> 00:02:04.860
 So I would not know that completely yet 

00:02:02.310 --> 00:02:06.479
 just how come miami wants to 

00:02:04.860 --> 00:02:07.039
 the connecting flight takes a look 

00:02:06.479 --> 00:02:09.840
 that on 

00:02:07.039 --> 00:02:12.390
 Otherwise type Pennsylvania sees them 

00:02:09.840 --> 00:02:13.140
 pittsburgh pittsburgh welcome to back to 

00:02:12.390 --> 00:02:15.150

00:02:13.140 --> 00:02:17.360
 So back he really asks it so 

00:02:15.150 --> 00:02:18.840
 Welcome back to america like that and 

00:02:17.360 --> 00:02:20.850
 not so bad 

00:02:18.840 --> 00:02:24.420
 like not to stand if you do not like it 

00:02:20.850 --> 00:02:28.819
 the ticket for the flight to pittsburgh 

00:02:24.420 --> 00:02:35.760
 and this divides the household sees 

00:02:28.819 --> 00:02:40.110
 So yes, guest blog germany review 

00:02:35.760 --> 00:02:41.640

00:02:40.110 --> 00:02:44.970

00:02:41.640 --> 00:02:46.590

00:02:44.970 --> 00:02:48.090
 me american as an army sees 

00:02:46.590 --> 00:02:51.630
 any of which is already very 

00:02:48.090 --> 00:02:56.250
 hard to formulate and festive 

00:02:51.630 --> 00:02:58.680

00:02:56.250 --> 00:02:59.880
