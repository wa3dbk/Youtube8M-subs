00:00:17.330 --> 00:00:22.710
 We are the fruit winery van took 

00:00:20.010 --> 00:00:25.529
 have the great luck that we together 

00:00:22.710 --> 00:00:27.449
 with the hapag lloyd cruises for the 

00:00:25.529 --> 00:00:29.400

00:00:27.449 --> 00:00:33.529
 may provide special vw together 

00:00:29.400 --> 00:00:33.529
 from quinces and apples 

00:00:41.990 --> 00:00:47.670
 fruit juice wineries invite us, so to speak 

00:00:45.030 --> 00:00:49.440
 there has been my great-grandfather since 1917 

00:00:47.670 --> 00:00:51.510
 from rÃ¼benkraut apple weed to 

00:00:49.440 --> 00:00:54.270
 have been doing since the beginning of the 30s 

00:00:51.510 --> 00:00:54.990
 we make fruit from local fruit 

00:00:54.270 --> 00:00:57.210
 juices 

00:00:54.990 --> 00:00:59.670
 I believe that our philosophy as 

00:00:57.210 --> 00:01:02.400
 small medium-sized fruit winery 

00:00:59.670 --> 00:01:05.420
 Rear premium segment in the area 

00:01:02.400 --> 00:01:08.820
 gourmet to operate very well also fits 

00:01:05.420 --> 00:01:12.479
 on the alignment of the European and the 

00:01:08.820 --> 00:01:16.200
 europe 2 because the guests are expecting something 

00:01:12.479 --> 00:01:18.869
 special and enjoy our customers 

00:01:16.200 --> 00:01:20.940
 rubber is buy our juices 

00:01:18.869 --> 00:01:23.780
 they are also allowed to do something 

00:01:20.940 --> 00:01:23.780
 special always 

00:01:36.280 --> 00:01:43.650
 it will give a very special juice 

00:01:40.200 --> 00:01:47.350
 and that is a mixture of 

00:01:43.650 --> 00:01:49.600
 apple juice from local apples we 

00:01:47.350 --> 00:01:51.850
 Here on the Lower Rhine Keltern and to 

00:01:49.600 --> 00:01:54.909
 others quince juice both as 

00:01:51.850 --> 00:01:56.950
 juices made these creations 

00:01:54.909 --> 00:01:58.869
 So far, there is a portfolio in our portfolio 

00:01:56.950 --> 00:02:01.090
 not and therefore it is something 

00:01:58.869 --> 00:02:04.229
 exclusive what it is on the europe and 

00:02:01.090 --> 00:02:04.229
 Europe wants to give 2 

00:02:21.660 --> 00:02:27.580
 We will label our bottles 

00:02:25.380 --> 00:02:29.980
 We have already filled that is if 

00:02:27.580 --> 00:02:32.530
 put a capsule on top and it will 

00:02:29.980 --> 00:02:35.890
 the sun label for the ms europe and 

00:02:32.530 --> 00:02:37.960
 ms europa 2 with attached and so can 

00:02:35.890 --> 00:02:45.910
 now our special edition on the 

00:02:37.960 --> 00:02:47.290
 Travel cooperate with you 

00:02:45.910 --> 00:02:50.620
 first names were born so that we 

00:02:47.290 --> 00:02:53.020
 have determined that the topic is not 

00:02:50.620 --> 00:02:53.680
 Alcoholic drinks always to eat 

00:02:53.020 --> 00:02:55.270
 becomes more important 

00:02:53.680 --> 00:02:57.610
 we want because even just in Europe 

00:02:55.270 --> 00:02:59.410
 2 1 focus on that you just 

00:02:57.610 --> 00:03:00.790
 a sophisticated sophisticated 

00:02:59.410 --> 00:03:03.070
 companion to eat he does not get 

00:03:00.790 --> 00:03:04.630
 always looking to be funny 

00:03:03.070 --> 00:03:05.830
 after this possibility we have ourselves 

00:03:04.630 --> 00:03:07.450
 Also very funny is fruit juices 

00:03:05.830 --> 00:03:09.700
 dealt with and have very fast 

00:03:07.450 --> 00:03:11.980
 found that outstanding products 

00:03:09.700 --> 00:03:14.710
 come from the winery van took and 

00:03:11.980 --> 00:03:16.420
 Then we came up with the idea sometimes 

00:03:14.710 --> 00:03:19.800
 to make common juice for it 

00:03:16.420 --> 00:03:19.800
 exclusive of the two ships 

00:03:29.870 --> 00:03:32.989
 mature mature name tobacco people fit 

00:03:31.459 --> 00:03:34.760
 from my point of view quite naturally 

00:03:32.989 --> 00:03:35.840
 symbiotic together because we both enter 

00:03:34.760 --> 00:03:37.849
 pursue a goal 

00:03:35.840 --> 00:03:40.390
 the best possible in our area 

00:03:37.849 --> 00:03:40.390
 produce product
