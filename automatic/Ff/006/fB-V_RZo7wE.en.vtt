as long as I can remember so when they

00:00:50.640 --> 00:00:52.760 
as long as I can remember so when they
said<00:00:50.910> that<00:00:51.090> the<00:00:51.210> new<00:00:51.360> 725<00:00:52.200> is<00:00:52.410> packed<00:00:52.650> with

00:00:52.760 --> 00:00:52.770 
said that the new 725 is packed with

00:00:52.770 --> 00:00:55.910 
said that the new 725 is packed with
features<00:00:54.020> we<00:00:55.020> just<00:00:55.200> had<00:00:55.320> to<00:00:55.410> get<00:00:55.530> an<00:00:55.620> older<00:00:55.800> one

00:00:55.910 --> 00:00:55.920 
features we just had to get an older one

00:00:55.920 --> 00:01:01.040 
features we just had to get an older one
and<00:00:56.280> have<00:00:56.400> a<00:00:56.489> look<00:00:56.610> for<00:00:56.760> ourselves<00:00:59.720> here<00:01:00.720> it<00:01:00.900> is

00:01:01.040 --> 00:01:01.050 
and have a look for ourselves here it is

00:01:01.050 --> 00:01:04.370 
and have a look for ourselves here it is
brown<00:01:02.010> of<00:01:02.160> 725<00:01:02.730> so<00:01:03.600> brown<00:01:03.870> and<00:01:03.990> have<00:01:04.080> made<00:01:04.229> some

00:01:04.370 --> 00:01:04.380 
brown of 725 so brown and have made some

00:01:04.380 --> 00:01:05.900 
brown of 725 so brown and have made some
pretty<00:01:04.500> big<00:01:04.710> claims<00:01:05.009> about<00:01:05.309> this<00:01:05.490> new<00:01:05.640> shotgun

00:01:05.900 --> 00:01:05.910 
pretty big claims about this new shotgun

00:01:05.910 --> 00:01:08.510 
pretty big claims about this new shotgun
and<00:01:06.240> its<00:01:06.360> new<00:01:06.540> features<00:01:07.050> so<00:01:07.350> let's<00:01:08.280> just<00:01:08.430> go

00:01:08.510 --> 00:01:08.520 
and its new features so let's just go

00:01:08.520 --> 00:01:16.910 
and its new features so let's just go
and<00:01:08.580> have<00:01:08.640> a<00:01:08.729> look<00:01:08.880> see<00:01:09.119> what<00:01:09.150> it<00:01:09.330> can<00:01:09.420> do<00:01:15.920> from

00:01:16.910 --> 00:01:16.920 
and have a look see what it can do from

00:01:16.920 --> 00:01:19.280 
and have a look see what it can do from
the<00:01:17.040> outset<00:01:17.490> this<00:01:18.360> gun<00:01:18.630> looks<00:01:18.840> like<00:01:18.990> a<00:01:19.020> lot<00:01:19.259> of

00:01:19.280 --> 00:01:19.290 
the outset this gun looks like a lot of

00:01:19.290 --> 00:01:21.050 
the outset this gun looks like a lot of
the<00:01:19.410> other<00:01:19.530> guns<00:01:19.710> in<00:01:19.830> the<00:01:19.920> Browning<00:01:20.250> range<00:01:20.460> but

the 72 fives have been fitted with the

00:01:23.250 --> 00:01:26.060 
the 72 fives have been fitted with the
backboard<00:01:23.729> vector<00:01:24.149> Pro<00:01:24.390> barrels<00:01:24.890> now<00:01:25.890> these

00:01:26.060 --> 00:01:26.070 
backboard vector Pro barrels now these

00:01:26.070 --> 00:01:28.280 
backboard vector Pro barrels now these
are<00:01:26.220> designed<00:01:26.490> to<00:01:26.580> improve<00:01:26.729> swing<00:01:27.330> ergonomics

00:01:28.280 --> 00:01:28.290 
are designed to improve swing ergonomics

00:01:28.290 --> 00:01:30.380 
are designed to improve swing ergonomics
and<00:01:28.410> balance<00:01:29.009> as<00:01:29.220> well<00:01:29.820> as<00:01:29.940> being<00:01:30.119> long

00:01:30.380 --> 00:01:30.390 
and balance as well as being long

00:01:30.390 --> 00:01:38.600

00:01:38.600 --> 00:01:38.610 

00:01:38.610 --> 00:01:40.700 

there's<00:01:39.240> also<00:01:39.450> a<00:01:39.870> new<00:01:40.110> improved<00:01:40.350> trigger

00:01:40.700 --> 00:01:40.710 
there's also a new improved trigger

00:01:40.710 --> 00:01:42.380 
there's also a new improved trigger
mechanism<00:01:41.220> which<00:01:41.340> gives<00:01:41.550> a<00:01:41.670> shooter<00:01:42.090> greater

00:01:42.380 --> 00:01:42.390 
mechanism which gives a shooter greater

00:01:42.390 --> 00:01:43.820 
mechanism which gives a shooter greater
fear<00:01:42.720> when<00:01:42.870> it's<00:01:42.990> taking<00:01:43.320> the<00:01:43.380> shot

00:01:43.820 --> 00:01:43.830 
fear when it's taking the shot

00:01:43.830 --> 00:01:45.320 
fear when it's taking the shot
the<00:01:44.070> limited<00:01:44.460> movement<00:01:44.820> within<00:01:44.940> the<00:01:45.060> trigger

00:01:45.320 --> 00:01:45.330 
the limited movement within the trigger

00:01:45.330 --> 00:01:47.960 
the limited movement within the trigger
mechanism<00:01:45.540> makes<00:01:46.380> it<00:01:46.530> lighter<00:01:46.800> shorter<00:01:47.790> and

00:01:47.960 --> 00:01:47.970 
mechanism makes it lighter shorter and

00:01:47.970 --> 00:01:52.280 
mechanism makes it lighter shorter and
faster<00:01:48.390> the<00:01:49.140> 725<00:01:50.010> also<00:01:50.880> has<00:01:51.030> a<00:01:51.060> new<00:01:51.480> low<00:01:52.050> action

00:01:52.280 --> 00:01:52.290 
faster the 725 also has a new low action

00:01:52.290 --> 00:01:55.180 
faster the 725 also has a new low action
frame<00:01:52.800> which<00:01:53.580> is<00:01:53.730> longer<00:01:54.060> and<00:01:54.300> more<00:01:54.570> compact

00:01:55.180 --> 00:01:55.190 
frame which is longer and more compact

00:01:55.190 --> 00:01:58.160 
frame which is longer and more compact
making<00:01:56.190> it<00:01:56.280> quicker<00:01:56.520> to<00:01:56.760> aim<00:01:56.910> reduce<00:01:57.690> a<00:01:57.840> muzzle

00:01:58.160 --> 00:01:58.170 
making it quicker to aim reduce a muzzle

00:01:58.170 --> 00:01:59.900 
making it quicker to aim reduce a muzzle
flip<00:01:58.380> and<00:01:58.920> making<00:01:59.190> it<00:01:59.280> come<00:01:59.430> fear<00:01:59.700> for<00:01:59.850> the

00:01:59.900 --> 00:01:59.910 
flip and making it come fear for the

00:01:59.910 --> 00:02:06.620 
flip and making it come fear for the
shooter<00:02:00.240> also<00:02:03.560> now<00:02:04.760> the<00:02:05.760> DES<00:02:06.150> in<00:02:06.330> vector

00:02:06.620 --> 00:02:06.630

recoil<00:02:27.510> pad<00:02:27.720> now<00:02:28.380> this<00:02:28.560> is<00:02:28.709> designed<00:02:28.800> in<00:02:29.220> such

00:02:29.240 --> 00:02:29.250 
recoil pad now this is designed in such

00:02:29.250 --> 00:02:32.000 
recoil pad now this is designed in such
a<00:02:29.400> way<00:02:29.520> that<00:02:30.300> it<00:02:30.420> pushes<00:02:30.600> recoil<00:02:31.200> away<00:02:31.500> and

00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:32.010 
a way that it pushes recoil away and

00:02:32.010 --> 00:02:34.310 
a way that it pushes recoil away and
down<00:02:32.220> from<00:02:32.430> the<00:02:32.550> shooters<00:02:32.880> cheek<00:02:33.170> it<00:02:34.170> also

00:02:34.310 --> 00:02:34.320 
down from the shooters cheek it also

00:02:34.320 --> 00:02:36.050 
down from the shooters cheek it also
comes<00:02:34.650> with<00:02:34.709> three<00:02:34.890> spaces<00:02:35.490> so<00:02:35.760> that<00:02:35.880> you<00:02:35.940> can

00:02:36.050 --> 00:02:36.060 
comes with three spaces so that you can

00:02:36.060 --> 00:02:44.420 
comes with three spaces so that you can
lengthen<00:02:36.270> or<00:02:36.810> shorten<00:02:36.900> the<00:02:37.320> size<00:02:37.500> of<00:02:37.680> start

00:02:44.420 --> 00:02:44.430 

00:02:44.430 --> 00:02:47.270 

so<00:02:45.079> that's<00:02:46.079> some<00:02:46.290> pretty<00:02:46.500> big<00:02:46.709> claims<00:02:46.980> Brown

00:02:47.270 --> 00:02:47.280 
so that's some pretty big claims Brown

00:02:47.280 --> 00:02:48.589 
so that's some pretty big claims Brown
have<00:02:47.489> made<00:02:47.610> about<00:02:47.819> the<00:02:47.970> new<00:02:48.090> features<00:02:48.480> on

00:02:48.589 --> 00:02:48.599 
have made about the new features on

00:02:48.599 --> 00:02:55.250 
have made about the new features on
their<00:02:48.780> gun<00:02:49.640> let's<00:02:50.640> see<00:02:50.760> how<00:02:50.819> much<00:02:50.939> shoes<00:02:54.260> so

00:02:55.250 --> 00:02:55.260 
their gun let's see how much shoes so
