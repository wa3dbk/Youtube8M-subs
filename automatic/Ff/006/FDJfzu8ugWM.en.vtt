feeling that we are one community in two
different<00:01:40.229> places

different places

00:01:41.010 --> 00:01:44.960 
different places
I<00:01:41.630> think<00:01:42.630> they'll<00:01:42.750> think<00:01:42.930> of<00:01:43.050> Patchogue<00:01:44.010> and

00:01:44.960 --> 00:01:44.970 
I think they'll think of Patchogue and

00:01:44.970 --> 00:01:47.870 
I think they'll think of Patchogue and
while<00:01:45.119> I<00:01:45.150> say<00:01:45.479> I'm<00:01:45.660> in<00:01:46.229> a<00:01:46.320> lot<00:01:46.500> of<00:01:46.530> ways<00:01:46.770> as<00:01:47.100> as

00:01:47.870 --> 00:01:47.880 
while I say I'm in a lot of ways as as

00:01:47.880 --> 00:01:50.570 
while I say I'm in a lot of ways as as
communities<00:01:48.479> that<00:01:48.990> have<00:01:49.259> a<00:01:49.290> common<00:01:49.740> goal<00:01:49.890> take

00:01:50.570 --> 00:01:50.580 
communities that have a common goal take

00:01:50.580 --> 00:01:51.740 
communities that have a common goal take
care<00:01:50.759> that<00:01:50.940> people<00:01:51.240> take<00:01:51.420> care<00:01:51.600> of<00:01:51.660> their

00:01:51.740 --> 00:01:51.750 
care that people take care of their

00:01:51.750 --> 00:01:58.460 
care that people take care of their
families<00:01:52.200> I<00:01:56.600> think<00:01:57.600> that<00:01:57.720> the<00:01:57.990> most<00:01:58.110> striking

00:01:58.460 --> 00:01:58.470 
families I think that the most striking

00:01:58.470 --> 00:02:00.680 
families I think that the most striking
thing<00:01:58.770> was<00:01:58.950> the<00:01:59.460> perception<00:01:59.880> of<00:02:00.090> immigration

00:02:00.680 --> 00:02:00.690 
thing was the perception of immigration

00:02:00.690 --> 00:02:03.499 
thing was the perception of immigration
from<00:02:00.930> the<00:02:01.080> outside<00:02:01.440> of<00:02:01.560> the<00:02:01.619> border<00:02:01.950> and<00:02:02.509> the

00:02:03.499 --> 00:02:03.509 
from the outside of the border and the

00:02:03.509 --> 00:02:05.900 
from the outside of the border and the
families<00:02:03.990> that<00:02:04.080> have<00:02:04.140> been<00:02:04.340> separated<00:02:05.340> in

00:02:05.900 --> 00:02:05.910 
families that have been separated in

00:02:05.910 --> 00:02:09.259 
families that have been separated in
some<00:02:06.210> cases<00:02:06.420> destroyed<00:02:07.080> and<00:02:07.380> kids<00:02:08.340> and<00:02:08.580> people

00:02:11.029 --> 00:02:11.039 
that have not been heard from but it's

00:02:11.039 --> 00:02:13.280 
that have not been heard from but it's
very<00:02:11.160> striking<00:02:11.459> very<00:02:12.090> striking<00:02:12.480> to<00:02:12.660> tell<00:02:13.260> a

00:02:13.280 --> 00:02:13.290 
very striking very striking to tell a
