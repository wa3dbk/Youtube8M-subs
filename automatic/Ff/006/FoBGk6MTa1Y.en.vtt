movies and all that other stuff jumping
down<00:00:33.270> we<00:00:33.450> can<00:00:33.570> see<00:00:33.719> that<00:00:33.809> it<00:00:33.899> features<00:00:34.110> the

00:00:34.220 --> 00:00:34.230 
down we can see that it features the

00:00:34.230 --> 00:00:37.250 
down we can see that it features the
extreme<00:00:34.680> engine<00:00:35.100> digi+<00:00:35.880> -<00:00:36.180> this<00:00:36.690> is<00:00:36.840> optimal

00:00:37.250 --> 00:00:37.260 
extreme engine digi+ - this is optimal

00:00:37.260 --> 00:00:38.959 
extreme engine digi+ - this is optimal

and<00:00:39.270> intelligent<00:00:39.840> digital<00:00:40.050> design<00:00:40.620> this<00:00:41.100> is

00:00:41.209 --> 00:00:41.219 
and intelligent digital design this is

00:00:41.219 --> 00:00:42.889 
and intelligent digital design this is
basically<00:00:41.550> the<00:00:41.760> MOSFETs<00:00:42.270> and<00:00:42.420> all<00:00:42.510> that<00:00:42.660> stuff

00:00:42.889 --> 00:00:42.899 
basically the MOSFETs and all that stuff

00:00:42.899 --> 00:00:44.840 
basically the MOSFETs and all that stuff
and<00:00:43.079> how<00:00:43.200> the<00:00:43.260> board<00:00:43.559> works<00:00:43.829> within<00:00:44.129> itself<00:00:44.430> to

00:00:44.840 --> 00:00:44.850 
and how the board works within itself to

00:00:44.850 --> 00:00:46.279 
and how the board works within itself to
keep<00:00:44.969> it<00:00:45.120> running<00:00:45.300> cool<00:00:45.629> and<00:00:45.930> great<00:00:46.110> for

00:00:46.279 --> 00:00:46.289 
keep it running cool and great for

00:00:46.289 --> 00:00:48.619 
keep it running cool and great for
overclocking<00:00:47.070> moving<00:00:47.700> down<00:00:47.820> the<00:00:47.940> box<00:00:48.090> we<00:00:48.480> see

00:00:48.619 --> 00:00:48.629 
overclocking moving down the box we see

00:00:48.629 --> 00:00:49.610 
overclocking moving down the box we see
they<00:00:48.750> have<00:00:48.840> a<00:00:48.870> little<00:00:49.050> feature<00:00:49.230> here<00:00:49.469> that's

00:00:49.610 --> 00:00:49.620 
they have a little feature here that's

00:00:49.620 --> 00:00:51.709 
they have a little feature here that's
called<00:00:49.800> game<00:00:50.340> first<00:00:50.969> and<00:00:51.120> we<00:00:51.239> see<00:00:51.420> it's<00:00:51.539> the

00:00:51.709 --> 00:00:51.719 
called game first and we see it's the

00:00:51.719 --> 00:00:54.110 
called game first and we see it's the
speed<00:00:52.050> you<00:00:52.379> need<00:00:52.649> to<00:00:53.010> pawn<00:00:53.280> when<00:00:54.000> you're

00:00:54.110 --> 00:00:54.120 
speed you need to pawn when you're

00:00:54.120 --> 00:00:56.090 
speed you need to pawn when you're
playing<00:00:54.329> games<00:00:54.600> online<00:00:54.980> latency<00:00:55.980> is

00:00:56.090 --> 00:00:56.100 
playing games online latency is

00:00:56.100 --> 00:00:57.229 
playing games online latency is
something<00:00:56.430> that<00:00:56.520> helps<00:00:56.670> keep<00:00:56.940> you<00:00:57.059> moving

00:00:57.229 --> 00:00:57.239 
something that helps keep you moving

00:00:57.239 --> 00:00:59.360 
something that helps keep you moving
fast<00:00:57.809> that<00:00:58.079> you<00:00:58.199> don't<00:00:58.230> get<00:00:58.500> fragged<00:00:58.859> by<00:00:59.010> other

00:00:59.360 --> 00:00:59.370 
fast that you don't get fragged by other

00:00:59.370 --> 00:01:01.910 
fast that you don't get fragged by other
people<00:01:00.030> with<00:01:00.539> this<00:01:00.899> new<00:01:01.140> stuff<00:01:01.440> it<00:01:01.649> actually

00:01:01.910 --> 00:01:01.920 
people with this new stuff it actually

00:01:01.920 --> 00:01:04.009 
people with this new stuff it actually
helps<00:01:02.520> improve<00:01:02.910> your<00:01:02.940> latency<00:01:03.480> so<00:01:03.930> that

00:01:04.009 --> 00:01:04.019 
helps improve your latency so that

00:01:04.019 --> 00:01:05.840 
helps improve your latency so that
you're<00:01:04.170> not<00:01:04.350> getting<00:01:04.559> fragged<00:01:04.979> all<00:01:05.220> the<00:01:05.610> time

00:01:05.840 --> 00:01:05.850 
you're not getting fragged all the time

00:01:05.850 --> 00:01:07.460 
you're not getting fragged all the time
we'll<00:01:06.330> see<00:01:06.510> that<00:01:06.659> more<00:01:06.900> when<00:01:06.960> we<00:01:07.049> jump<00:01:07.320> into

00:01:07.460 --> 00:01:07.470 
we'll see that more when we jump into

00:01:07.470 --> 00:01:09.440 
we'll see that more when we jump into
the<00:01:07.619> review<00:01:07.770> we're<00:01:08.610> going<00:01:08.820> down<00:01:08.970> further<00:01:09.299> in

if you need it use it I use something

00:01:52.439 --> 00:01:54.319 
if you need it use it I use something
different<00:01:52.799> but<00:01:52.890> it's<00:01:53.040> here<00:01:53.340> and<00:01:53.430> lastly<00:01:54.000> we

at the back of the box now let's jump in

00:02:04.530 --> 00:02:09.889 
at the back of the box now let's jump in
to<00:02:04.799> the<00:02:04.890> actual<00:02:05.189> unboxing<00:02:08.629> alright<00:02:09.629> so<00:02:09.810> now

00:02:09.889 --> 00:02:09.899 
to the actual unboxing alright so now

to the actual unboxing alright so now
let's<00:02:09.959> pop<00:02:10.289> the<00:02:10.440> top<00:02:10.619> let's<00:02:11.280> take<00:02:11.459> a<00:02:11.489> look<00:02:11.700> here

00:02:11.900 --> 00:02:11.910 
let's pop the top let's take a look here

00:02:11.910 --> 00:02:12.840 
let's pop the top let's take a look here
let<00:02:12.090> me<00:02:12.150> take<00:02:12.330> out<00:02:12.450> this<00:02:12.540> little

00:02:12.840 --> 00:02:12.850 
let me take out this little

00:02:12.850 --> 00:02:16.020 
let me take out this little
plastic<00:02:13.180> cover<00:02:13.360> right<00:02:13.570> here<00:02:14.130> and<00:02:15.130> this<00:02:15.850> time

plastic cover right here and this time
we'll<00:02:16.270> actually<00:02:16.540> start<00:02:16.810> off<00:02:16.930> and<00:02:17.230> we'll<00:02:17.470> take

00:02:17.640 --> 00:02:17.650 
we'll actually start off and we'll take

00:02:17.650 --> 00:02:20.340 
we'll actually start off and we'll take
a<00:02:17.680> look<00:02:18.010> at<00:02:18.190> the<00:02:18.340> motherboard<00:02:18.730> itself<00:02:19.260> can<00:02:20.260> you

00:02:20.340 --> 00:02:20.350 
a look at the motherboard itself can you

00:02:20.350 --> 00:02:21.480 
a look at the motherboard itself can you
go<00:02:20.440> ahead<00:02:20.530> and<00:02:20.710> try<00:02:20.770> to<00:02:20.860> pull<00:02:21.160> this<00:02:21.280> out<00:02:21.430> of

00:02:21.480 --> 00:02:21.490 
go ahead and try to pull this out of

00:02:21.490 --> 00:02:22.650 
go ahead and try to pull this out of
here<00:02:21.700> it's<00:02:21.790> kind<00:02:21.970> of<00:02:22.000> a<00:02:22.060> lock<00:02:22.330> little

00:02:22.650 --> 00:02:22.660 
here it's kind of a lock little

00:02:22.660 --> 00:02:26.160 
here it's kind of a lock little
cardboard<00:02:23.050> here<00:02:24.420> go<00:02:25.420> ahead<00:02:25.630> and<00:02:25.720> get<00:02:25.870> that<00:02:25.990> out

00:02:26.160 --> 00:02:26.170 
cardboard here go ahead and get that out

00:02:26.170 --> 00:02:28.500 
cardboard here go ahead and get that out
of<00:02:26.200> there<00:02:26.880> we'll<00:02:27.880> go<00:02:27.970> and<00:02:28.090> take<00:02:28.180> a<00:02:28.240> look<00:02:28.420> at

00:02:28.500 --> 00:02:28.510 
of there we'll go and take a look at

00:02:28.510 --> 00:02:30.120 
of there we'll go and take a look at
this<00:02:28.630> nifty<00:02:28.840> step<00:02:29.170> afterwards<00:02:29.650> but<00:02:29.830> let's<00:02:30.010> do

00:02:30.120 --> 00:02:30.130 
this nifty step afterwards but let's do

00:02:30.130 --> 00:02:31.500 
this nifty step afterwards but let's do
this<00:02:30.250> backwards<00:02:30.460> at<00:02:30.760> this<00:02:30.850> time<00:02:31.090> we'll

00:02:31.500 --> 00:02:31.510 
this backwards at this time we'll

00:02:31.510 --> 00:02:33.650 
this backwards at this time we'll
actually<00:02:31.840> take<00:02:31.990> a<00:02:32.020> look<00:02:32.260> at<00:02:32.440> the<00:02:32.560> board<00:02:32.860> itself

00:02:33.650 --> 00:02:33.660 
actually take a look at the board itself

00:02:33.660 --> 00:02:37.080 
actually take a look at the board itself
so<00:02:34.660> check<00:02:34.900> it<00:02:35.020> out<00:02:35.110> you<00:02:35.430> can<00:02:36.430> see<00:02:36.610> there's

00:02:37.080 --> 00:02:37.090 
so check it out you can see there's

00:02:37.090 --> 00:02:39.960 
so check it out you can see there's
great<00:02:37.570> cooling<00:02:38.050> all<00:02:38.260> across<00:02:38.770> all<00:02:39.070> the<00:02:39.430> MOSFETs

00:02:39.960 --> 00:02:39.970 
great cooling all across all the MOSFETs

00:02:39.970 --> 00:02:41.550 
great cooling all across all the MOSFETs
the<00:02:40.150> chipsets<00:02:40.630> everything<00:02:41.230> is<00:02:41.350> being

00:02:41.550 --> 00:02:41.560 
the chipsets everything is being

00:02:41.560 --> 00:02:43.950 
the chipsets everything is being
completely<00:02:42.070> cooled<00:02:42.430> off<00:02:42.640> got<00:02:43.210> a<00:02:43.240> really<00:02:43.570> nice

00:02:43.950 --> 00:02:43.960 
completely cooled off got a really nice

00:02:43.960 --> 00:02:46.320 
completely cooled off got a really nice
big<00:02:44.260> giant<00:02:44.620> heat<00:02:44.800> pipe<00:02:45.010> up<00:02:45.250> here<00:02:45.460> on<00:02:45.580> top<00:02:45.610> it's

00:02:46.320 --> 00:02:46.330 
big giant heat pipe up here on top it's

00:02:46.330 --> 00:02:48.030 
big giant heat pipe up here on top it's
gonna<00:02:46.420> keep<00:02:46.660> everything<00:02:46.960> running<00:02:47.500> really

00:02:48.030 --> 00:02:48.040 
gonna keep everything running really

00:02:48.040 --> 00:02:50.520 
gonna keep everything running really
cool<00:02:48.490> obviously<00:02:49.480> the<00:02:49.780> color<00:02:49.990> scheme<00:02:50.350> is

00:02:50.520 --> 00:02:50.530 
cool obviously the color scheme is

00:02:50.530 --> 00:02:52.110 
cool obviously the color scheme is
really<00:02:50.620> cool<00:02:51.100> but<00:02:51.340> we're<00:02:51.460> like<00:02:51.580> on<00:02:51.730> trips<00:02:52.000> me

00:02:52.110 --> 00:02:52.120 
really cool but we're like on trips me

00:02:52.120 --> 00:02:53.820 
really cool but we're like on trips me
out<00:02:52.150> is<00:02:52.300> like<00:02:52.420> these<00:02:52.600> colors<00:02:52.870> the<00:02:53.440> red<00:02:53.650> and<00:02:53.770> the

00:02:53.820 --> 00:02:53.830 
out is like these colors the red and the

00:02:53.830 --> 00:02:56.310 
out is like these colors the red and the
black<00:02:54.010> these<00:02:54.250> are<00:02:54.400> actually<00:02:54.760> AMD<00:02:55.390> colors<00:02:55.810> but

00:02:56.310 --> 00:02:56.320 
black these are actually AMD colors but

00:02:56.320 --> 00:02:57.630 
black these are actually AMD colors but
get<00:02:56.440> lots<00:02:56.680> of<00:02:56.800> guys<00:02:56.950> who<00:02:57.100> like<00:02:57.280> these<00:02:57.430> colors

00:02:57.630 --> 00:02:57.640 
get lots of guys who like these colors

00:02:57.640 --> 00:02:59.190 
get lots of guys who like these colors
are<00:02:57.910> gonna<00:02:58.000> still<00:02:58.300> use<00:02:58.330> them<00:02:58.630> in<00:02:58.720> their<00:02:58.810> Intel

00:02:59.190 --> 00:02:59.200 
are gonna still use them in their Intel

00:02:59.200 --> 00:03:02.160 
are gonna still use them in their Intel
build<00:02:59.500> it's<00:03:00.070> kind<00:03:00.280> of<00:03:00.340> funny<00:03:00.580> we've<00:03:01.270> got<00:03:01.510> one

00:03:02.160 --> 00:03:02.170 
build it's kind of funny we've got one

00:03:02.170 --> 00:03:04.200 
build it's kind of funny we've got one
fan<00:03:02.800> connector<00:03:03.160> right<00:03:03.280> here<00:03:03.340> it's<00:03:03.910> hard<00:03:04.120> to

00:03:04.200 --> 00:03:04.210 
fan connector right here it's hard to

00:03:04.210 --> 00:03:06.780 
fan connector right here it's hard to
see<00:03:04.650> they're<00:03:05.650> gonna<00:03:05.710> move<00:03:05.950> over<00:03:06.160> here<00:03:06.370> we<00:03:06.700> have

00:03:06.780 --> 00:03:06.790 
see they're gonna move over here we have

00:03:06.790 --> 00:03:08.190 
see they're gonna move over here we have
the<00:03:06.910> eight<00:03:07.030> pin<00:03:07.180> power<00:03:07.420> connector<00:03:07.510> up<00:03:07.960> here<00:03:08.110> on

00:03:08.190 --> 00:03:08.200 
the eight pin power connector up here on

00:03:08.200 --> 00:03:09.690 
the eight pin power connector up here on
top<00:03:08.230> I'll<00:03:08.590> try<00:03:08.710> to<00:03:08.770> angle<00:03:09.130> the<00:03:09.220> motherboard<00:03:09.610> so

00:03:09.690 --> 00:03:09.700 
top I'll try to angle the motherboard so

00:03:09.700 --> 00:03:11.780 
top I'll try to angle the motherboard so
you<00:03:09.760> guys<00:03:09.880> can<00:03:10.060> possibly<00:03:10.390> see<00:03:10.600> that<00:03:10.750> better

00:03:11.780 --> 00:03:11.790 
you guys can possibly see that better

00:03:11.790 --> 00:03:14.430 
you guys can possibly see that better
moving<00:03:12.790> over<00:03:13.120> here<00:03:13.360> we<00:03:13.810> have<00:03:13.900> another<00:03:14.200> fan

we<00:04:53.410> take<00:04:53.590> a<00:04:53.650> look<00:04:53.920> at<00:04:54.160> the<00:04:54.520> SATA<00:04:54.730> connections

00:04:55.260 --> 00:04:55.270 
we take a look at the SATA connections

00:04:55.270 --> 00:04:57.300 
we take a look at the SATA connections
all<00:04:55.480> of<00:04:55.840> these<00:04:55.990> are<00:04:56.170> the<00:04:56.200> new<00:04:56.410> SATA<00:04:56.860> 3<00:04:56.980> that

00:04:57.300 --> 00:04:57.310 
all of these are the new SATA 3 that

00:04:57.310 --> 00:04:59.100 
all of these are the new SATA 3 that
support<00:04:57.670> the<00:04:57.820> six<00:04:58.330> gigabit<00:04:58.750> a<00:04:58.780> second

00:04:59.100 --> 00:04:59.110 
support the six gigabit a second

00:04:59.110 --> 00:05:01.140 
support the six gigabit a second
transfer<00:04:59.500> rate<00:04:59.680> we<00:05:00.340> also<00:05:00.370> see<00:05:00.880> that<00:05:00.910> there's

00:05:01.140 --> 00:05:01.150 
transfer rate we also see that there's

00:05:01.150 --> 00:05:02.340 
transfer rate we also see that there's
two<00:05:01.300> different<00:05:01.330> types<00:05:01.600> of<00:05:01.840> chips<00:05:02.050> that's<00:05:02.230> on

00:05:02.340 --> 00:05:02.350 
two different types of chips that's on

00:05:02.350 --> 00:05:03.690 
two different types of chips that's on
here<00:05:02.440> we're<00:05:02.590> going<00:05:02.680> to<00:05:02.740> have<00:05:02.860> the<00:05:03.010> Intel<00:05:03.460> and

00:05:03.690 --> 00:05:03.700 
here we're going to have the Intel and

00:05:03.700 --> 00:05:04.920 
here we're going to have the Intel and
then<00:05:03.940> the<00:05:04.030> other<00:05:04.180> one<00:05:04.330> which<00:05:04.420> is<00:05:04.450> going<00:05:04.660> to<00:05:04.780> be

00:05:04.920 --> 00:05:04.930 
then the other one which is going to be

00:05:04.930 --> 00:05:06.900 
then the other one which is going to be
the<00:05:05.200> Marvell<00:05:05.800> so<00:05:06.370> we're<00:05:06.460> going<00:05:06.550> to<00:05:06.610> start<00:05:06.790> off

00:05:06.900 --> 00:05:06.910 
the Marvell so we're going to start off

00:05:06.910 --> 00:05:08.280 
the Marvell so we're going to start off
over<00:05:06.940> here<00:05:07.330> we<00:05:07.570> see<00:05:07.720> that<00:05:07.840> we<00:05:07.900> have<00:05:07.990> a<00:05:08.020> legacy

00:05:08.280 --> 00:05:08.290
