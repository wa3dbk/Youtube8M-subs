next at the ketchup to the right I know
this<00:02:15.220> part<00:02:15.490> is<00:02:15.610> not<00:02:15.790> too<00:02:16.030> Vietnamese<00:02:16.540> we

00:02:16.920 --> 00:02:16.930 
this part is not too Vietnamese we

00:02:16.930 --> 00:02:19.680 
this part is not too Vietnamese we
should<00:02:17.140> originally<00:02:17.830> use<00:02:18.040> Tomatoes<00:02:18.910> paste<00:02:19.240> but

00:02:19.680 --> 00:02:19.690 
should originally use Tomatoes paste but

00:02:19.690 --> 00:02:21.750 
should originally use Tomatoes paste but
this<00:02:20.350> is<00:02:20.500> supposed<00:02:20.830> to<00:02:20.950> be<00:02:21.010> a<00:02:21.130> quick<00:02:21.400> and<00:02:21.610> easy

00:02:21.750 --> 00:02:21.760 
this is supposed to be a quick and easy

00:02:21.760 --> 00:02:23.910 
this is supposed to be a quick and easy
way<00:02:22.060> to<00:02:22.090> getting<00:02:22.630> around<00:02:22.720> recipes<00:02:23.440> like<00:02:23.650> this

00:02:23.910 --> 00:02:23.920 
way to getting around recipes like this

00:02:23.920 --> 00:02:26.700 
way to getting around recipes like this
plus<00:02:24.670> I<00:02:24.940> found<00:02:25.360> that<00:02:25.570> ketchup<00:02:25.870> gives<00:02:26.260> the<00:02:26.500> same

00:02:26.700 --> 00:02:26.710 
plus I found that ketchup gives the same

00:02:26.710 --> 00:02:28.920 
plus I found that ketchup gives the same
effect<00:02:26.850> which<00:02:27.850> is<00:02:27.880> the<00:02:28.030> color<00:02:28.390> and<00:02:28.780> the<00:02:28.900> flavor

00:02:28.920 --> 00:02:28.930 
effect which is the color and the flavor

00:02:28.930 --> 00:02:32.970 
effect which is the color and the flavor

00:02:32.970 --> 00:02:32.980 
so why not stir that up turn off the

00:02:32.980 --> 00:02:36.720
