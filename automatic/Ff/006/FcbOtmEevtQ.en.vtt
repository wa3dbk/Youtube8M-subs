00:00:09.200 --> 00:00:09.210 
something that that's a wide range of

00:00:09.210 --> 00:00:12.379 
something that that's a wide range of
applications<00:00:09.990> and<00:00:10.429> it's<00:00:11.429> a<00:00:11.550> relatively<00:00:11.969> quick

implant that's being installed and you

00:00:20.670 --> 00:00:22.970 
implant that's being installed and you
can't<00:00:20.910> load<00:00:21.150> it<00:00:21.330> up<00:00:21.449> for<00:00:21.750> a<00:00:21.779> while<00:00:21.990> and<00:00:22.769> you
