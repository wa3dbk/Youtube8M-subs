00:00:24.140 --> 00:00:24.150 
ok so it requires three modules I like

00:00:24.150 --> 00:00:28.370 
ok so it requires three modules I like
using<00:00:24.420> them<00:00:26.449> three<00:00:27.449> different<00:00:27.660> colors<00:00:28.170> I

00:00:28.370 --> 00:00:28.380 
using them three different colors I

00:00:28.380 --> 00:00:32.359 
using them three different colors I
think<00:00:28.619> it<00:00:28.740> looks<00:00:28.920> nice<00:00:29.189> so<00:00:30.410> yeah<00:00:31.410> so<00:00:32.250> you're

00:01:32.060 --> 00:01:32.070 
I'll fold this back up that another way

00:01:32.070 --> 00:01:35.060 
I'll fold this back up that another way
to<00:01:32.130> do<00:01:32.369> that<00:01:32.549> is<00:01:32.820> just<00:01:33.170> open<00:01:34.170> and<00:01:34.740> it's<00:01:34.860> gonna

00:01:35.060 --> 00:01:35.070 
to do that is just open and it's gonna

00:01:35.070 --> 00:01:39.289 
to do that is just open and it's gonna
tuck<00:01:35.579> it<00:01:35.759> under<00:01:36.030> like<00:01:36.210> that<00:01:38.180> you're<00:01:39.180> pretty

00:01:39.289 --> 00:01:39.299 
tuck it under like that you're pretty

00:01:39.299 --> 00:01:41.120 
tuck it under like that you're pretty
much<00:01:39.479> done<00:01:39.750> now<00:01:39.810> you<00:01:39.990> just<00:01:40.229> have<00:01:40.439> to<00:01:40.470> refold

00:01:41.120 --> 00:01:41.130 
much done now you just have to refold

00:01:41.130 --> 00:01:46.700 
much done now you just have to refold
the<00:01:41.250> flops<00:01:41.490> up<00:01:41.700> with<00:01:41.880> this<00:01:45.229> and<00:01:46.229> fold<00:01:46.500> it<00:01:46.619> in

00:01:46.700 --> 00:01:46.710

the flops up with this and fold it in
half<00:01:46.740> and<00:01:47.310> then<00:01:47.450> just<00:01:48.450> let<00:01:48.750> the<00:01:48.780> flaps<00:01:50.540> go

00:01:53.080 --> 00:01:53.090 
half and then just let the flaps go

make<00:01:58.530> two<00:01:58.740> more<00:01:58.950> and<00:01:59.880> you're<00:02:00.030> going<00:02:00.180> to<00:02:00.240> put

00:02:00.440 --> 00:02:00.450 
make two more and you're going to put

00:02:00.450 --> 00:02:05.420 
make two more and you're going to put
them<00:02:00.600> together<00:02:00.750> like<00:02:01.110> this<00:02:02.540> take<00:02:03.540> two<00:02:04.430> flaps

00:02:05.420 --> 00:02:05.430 
them together like this take two flaps

00:02:05.430 --> 00:02:11.240 
them together like this take two flaps
and<00:02:05.810> just<00:02:06.810> stick<00:02:07.140> them<00:02:07.670> both<00:02:08.670> sides<00:02:09.860> on<00:02:10.860> the

00:02:11.240 --> 00:02:11.250 
and just stick them both sides on the

00:02:11.250 --> 00:02:13.760 
and just stick them both sides on the
other<00:02:12.140> module<00:02:13.140> like

00:02:13.760 --> 00:02:13.770 
other module like

00:02:13.770 --> 00:02:16.700 
other module like
this<00:02:14.030> course<00:02:15.030> will<00:02:15.150> make<00:02:15.360> sure<00:02:15.540> it's<00:02:15.720> a<00:02:15.840> nice

00:02:16.700 --> 00:02:16.710 
this course will make sure it's a nice

00:02:16.710 --> 00:02:20.690 
this course will make sure it's a nice
and<00:02:17.010> tight<00:02:17.190> together<00:02:18.770> I'll<00:02:19.770> turn<00:02:20.010> it<00:02:20.130> over<00:02:20.280> and

00:02:20.690 --> 00:02:20.700 
and tight together I'll turn it over and

00:02:20.700 --> 00:02:22.070 
and tight together I'll turn it over and
you're<00:02:21.000> going<00:02:21.150> to<00:02:21.240> do<00:02:21.360> the<00:02:21.510> same<00:02:21.750> with<00:02:21.930> the

00:02:22.070 --> 00:02:22.080 
you're going to do the same with the

00:02:22.080 --> 00:02:27.530 
you're going to do the same with the
other<00:02:22.260> flats<00:02:22.620> so<00:02:23.430> take<00:02:23.640> these<00:02:23.910> flaps<00:02:25.340> and<00:02:26.540> then

00:02:27.530 --> 00:02:27.540 
other flats so take these flaps and then

00:02:27.540 --> 00:02:32.410 
other flats so take these flaps and then
sit<00:02:27.900> from<00:02:28.610> the<00:02:29.610> both<00:02:29.970> sides<00:02:30.000> of<00:02:30.570> another<00:02:30.870> model

00:02:32.410 --> 00:02:32.420 
sit from the both sides of another model

00:02:32.420 --> 00:02:46.400 
sit from the both sides of another model
module<00:02:34.880> this<00:02:41.720> and<00:02:43.280> then<00:02:44.280> if<00:02:44.400> these<00:02:44.610> flaps<00:02:45.410> get

00:02:46.400 --> 00:02:46.410 
module this and then if these flaps get

00:02:46.410 --> 00:02:49.370 
module this and then if these flaps get
tucked<00:02:46.650> under<00:02:47.010> there<00:02:47.220> just<00:02:48.110> lift<00:02:49.110> them<00:02:49.230> out

00:02:49.370 --> 00:02:49.380 
tucked under there just lift them out

00:02:49.380 --> 00:02:50.300 
tucked under there just lift them out
like<00:02:49.800> that

00:02:50.300 --> 00:02:50.310 
like that

00:02:50.310 --> 00:02:55.220 
like that
and<00:02:50.400> then<00:02:51.300> stick<00:02:52.050> them<00:02:53.450> in<00:02:54.450> there<00:02:54.750> and<00:02:55.080> just

00:02:55.220 --> 00:02:55.230 
and then stick them in there and just

00:02:55.230 --> 00:03:01.820 
and then stick them in there and just
side<00:02:55.500> push<00:02:55.920> it<00:02:56.430> together<00:02:59.270> that<00:03:00.270> and<00:03:01.080> your

00:03:01.820 --> 00:03:01.830 
side push it together that and your

00:03:01.830 --> 00:03:05.600 
side push it together that and your
fortune<00:03:02.160> cookie<00:03:02.430> box<00:03:02.640> is<00:03:02.970> complete<00:03:04.310> so<00:03:05.310> once

00:03:05.600 --> 00:03:05.610 
fortune cookie box is complete so once

00:03:05.610 --> 00:03:07.850 
fortune cookie box is complete so once
again<00:03:05.730> how<00:03:06.090> to<00:03:06.150> open<00:03:06.360> it<00:03:06.600> you<00:03:06.780> just<00:03:06.840> put<00:03:07.290> high

00:03:07.850 --> 00:03:07.860 
again how to open it you just put high

00:03:07.860 --> 00:03:13.160 
again how to open it you just put high
pressures<00:03:08.310> in<00:03:08.340> here<00:03:08.670> and<00:03:08.960> crack<00:03:09.960> it<00:03:09.990> open<00:03:12.170> you
