00:00:04.350 --> 00:00:06.920
 i 

00:00:07.110 --> 00:00:11.040
 of goal 

00:00:08.850 --> 00:00:13.110
 What do you have 

00:00:11.040 --> 00:00:15.150
 nothing 

00:00:13.110 --> 00:00:19.260
 nothing happens to me 

00:00:15.150 --> 00:00:21.650
 and you know that you can trust me to 

00:00:19.260 --> 00:00:24.369
 whatever is 

00:00:21.650 --> 00:00:24.369
 What do you have 

00:00:25.900 --> 00:00:28.410
 is that 

00:00:28.480 --> 00:00:31.859
 this place lion 

00:00:32.029 --> 00:00:37.719
 you can not believe that just that scenario 

00:00:34.820 --> 00:00:37.719
 the wanderers 

00:00:39.040 --> 00:00:43.680
 this place is where my mom sang for 

00:00:41.290 --> 00:00:43.680
 last time 

00:00:44.880 --> 00:00:49.960
 imagine if for strong shipping what 

00:00:46.950 --> 00:00:52.270
 it must be for my dad 

00:00:49.960 --> 00:00:56.670
 so to do that I swear that the last 

00:00:52.270 --> 00:00:56.670
 who wants to hurt him either 

00:00:56.829 --> 00:01:04.510
 close your eyes 

00:00:59.600 --> 00:01:04.510
 and if you talk, it would not be me too 

00:01:08.190 --> 00:01:14.130
 close your eyes let trust 

00:01:11.930 --> 00:01:16.920
 any appointment then close your eyes 

00:01:14.130 --> 00:01:20.660
 men instead of land in the eyes of 

00:01:16.920 --> 00:01:20.660
 the earth to theirs 

00:01:20.970 --> 00:01:27.420
 imagine you're standing in the middle 

00:01:24.120 --> 00:01:29.390
 of the wonder scenario create my home 

00:01:27.420 --> 00:01:31.610
 I'm there 

00:01:29.390 --> 00:01:36.970
 they are all there 

00:01:31.610 --> 00:01:36.970
 and is jammed with people and you hear 

00:01:41.640 --> 00:01:44.240
 because also 

00:01:47.060 --> 00:01:52.260
 what do you feel 

00:01:49.210 --> 00:01:52.260
 you would not love 

00:01:57.200 --> 00:02:02.170
 but I can not read how not 

00:02:00.340 --> 00:02:04.990
 your mom would love to know that 

00:02:02.170 --> 00:02:08.050
 you were on the same stage as her 

00:02:04.990 --> 00:02:10.870
 It is not as simple as it seems 

00:02:08.050 --> 00:02:12.580
 if it is send your dad already accepted that you are 

00:02:10.870 --> 00:02:14.500
 in this race you do not close the 

00:02:12.580 --> 00:02:17.970
 doors and not even ask him what 

00:02:14.500 --> 00:02:17.970
 I do not know how to say it 

00:02:19.020 --> 00:02:22.740
 better than anyone do you know that these 

00:02:20.490 --> 00:02:26.710
 problems have to be faced 

00:02:22.740 --> 00:02:29.700
 do not run away from them ever 

00:02:26.710 --> 00:02:31.490
 what I do on the motocross track 

00:02:29.700 --> 00:02:33.410
 very bad the first race 

00:02:31.490 --> 00:02:35.630
 I get up and give my best for 

00:02:33.410 --> 00:02:37.350
 second as well as I'll be the track of 

00:02:35.630 --> 00:02:41.420
 motocross 

00:02:37.350 --> 00:02:41.420
 but when you are closer
