00:00:00.780 --> 00:00:03.020

00:00:10.140 --> 00:00:15.390
 of youtube in this video we are going to 

00:00:11.850 --> 00:00:17.140
 how to fix the error that since 2003 

00:00:15.390 --> 00:00:18.939
 It stopped working 

00:00:17.140 --> 00:00:21.340
 That usually happens when they enter 

00:00:18.939 --> 00:00:22.920
 friendly match to play to be a 

00:00:21.340 --> 00:00:26.280
 legend 

00:00:22.920 --> 00:00:28.080
 that happens because 2003 3 is missing 

00:00:26.280 --> 00:00:30.630
 some files to play the 

00:00:28.080 --> 00:00:33.900
 I play very well 

00:00:30.630 --> 00:00:35.130
 some fingers 

00:00:33.900 --> 00:00:37.540
 what they have to do is come here 

00:00:35.130 --> 00:00:40.850
 speak right click 

00:00:37.540 --> 00:00:42.980
 solve the problem 

00:00:40.850 --> 00:00:45.340
 and the computer are going to stop problems 

00:00:42.980 --> 00:00:45.340
 who have 

00:00:49.270 --> 00:00:53.010
 here 

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:55.440
 and supposedly we decided that I will give 

00:00:53.010 --> 00:00:57.960
 start of the program but that's 

00:00:55.440 --> 00:00:59.250
 totally lie is going to be going out 

00:00:57.960 --> 00:01:01.230
 forever 

00:00:59.250 --> 00:01:03.300
 what they have to do is go to the 

00:01:01.230 --> 00:01:04.930
 description of the video and there I will 

00:01:03.300 --> 00:01:10.760
 leave 

00:01:04.930 --> 00:01:12.680
 the psc link of 2013 patch of 6.0 

00:01:10.760 --> 00:01:14.780
 what they have to do is say when 

00:01:12.680 --> 00:01:17.540
 already downloaded it, just talk to the 

00:01:14.780 --> 00:01:20.270
 dale desktop right click extract 

00:01:17.540 --> 00:01:23.480
 here and that folder will come out what 

00:01:20.270 --> 00:01:27.010
 they have to give them install lift net 

00:01:23.480 --> 00:01:30.800
 nerf we accept the terms and finalize 

00:01:27.010 --> 00:01:32.780
 already when they have done all that is going to 

00:01:30.800 --> 00:01:35.560
 go out 

00:01:32.780 --> 00:01:39.149
 they will leave 

00:01:35.560 --> 00:01:39.149
 this little window 

00:01:40.300 --> 00:01:45.450
 what they have to do here 

00:01:43.030 --> 00:01:49.659
 come to play here 

00:01:45.450 --> 00:01:52.590
 and put exactly what I have 

00:01:49.659 --> 00:01:54.359

00:01:52.590 --> 00:01:56.100
 here I will tell you exactly what 

00:01:54.359 --> 00:01:58.050
 that they have to put in the case of 

00:01:56.100 --> 00:02:00.510
 your 

00:01:58.050 --> 00:02:04.730
 what they have to come here to play 

00:02:00.510 --> 00:02:04.730
 the right click screen resolution 

00:02:06.390 --> 00:02:09.140
 and put 

00:02:10.850 --> 00:02:16.090
 what you have here in resolution does not 

00:02:12.920 --> 00:02:18.670
 they have to put here in my case it's a thousand 

00:02:16.090 --> 00:02:22.310
 366 for 

00:02:18.670 --> 00:02:25.660
 768 and they put it in when they have put 

00:02:22.310 --> 00:02:28.970
 that and exactly it is already more booklets 

00:02:25.660 --> 00:02:31.310
 let's see who knows how to save him 

00:02:28.970 --> 00:02:33.110
 We accept and you will already know 

00:02:31.310 --> 00:02:36.370
 when we have closed this we come 

00:02:33.110 --> 00:02:36.370
 and we play here 

00:02:36.850 --> 00:02:41.530
 and here they have to put exactly the 

00:02:39.040 --> 00:02:43.840
 numbers as I have it 

00:02:41.530 --> 00:02:46.200
 here on keyboard how do you want to put your 

00:02:43.840 --> 00:02:46.200
 mango 

00:02:48.120 --> 00:02:53.150
 how 

00:02:50.120 --> 00:02:54.440
 how do you have the ability to complete 

00:02:53.150 --> 00:02:57.110
 to run the game 

00:02:54.440 --> 00:03:00.050
 in my case 64 mb 

00:02:57.110 --> 00:03:02.510
 of graphics cards I do not have very good 

00:03:00.050 --> 00:03:05.030
 graphic card as you can see but in 

00:03:02.510 --> 00:03:06.240
 If the game is not going very well we give it in 

00:03:05.030 --> 00:03:08.790
 to accept 

00:03:06.240 --> 00:03:12.530
 here in league so if we want the league 

00:03:08.790 --> 00:03:12.530
 we touch the photo and we will accept it 

00:03:14.930 --> 00:03:18.500
 here I am going to have them here 

00:03:16.700 --> 00:03:21.790
 selected here 

00:03:18.500 --> 00:03:21.790
 do not have to pass here 

00:03:22.469 --> 00:03:27.510
 here also do not have to pass here 

00:03:24.700 --> 00:03:27.510
 as I have 

00:03:27.920 --> 00:03:33.620
 after they have done that 

00:03:30.620 --> 00:03:34.879
 they have to play here and here is how 

00:03:33.620 --> 00:03:37.730
 want to have the marker 

00:03:34.879 --> 00:03:41.060
 I in my case have if you want 

00:03:37.730 --> 00:03:46.030
 have the same way in the photo and wool 

00:03:41.060 --> 00:03:46.030
 close and if they want another there they see 

00:03:46.200 --> 00:03:51.270
 There are enough to choose 

00:03:49.470 --> 00:03:53.550
 after they have chosen the one that you 

00:03:51.270 --> 00:03:55.590
 Like, we spend here how they want 

00:03:53.550 --> 00:03:59.170
 go to destination the referee 

00:03:55.590 --> 00:04:02.700
 let's say moliner let's continue in selection 

00:03:59.170 --> 00:04:06.209
 already when we have done this already the game 

00:04:02.700 --> 00:04:06.209
 will walk very well 

00:04:22.100 --> 00:04:25.270
 we open the game 

00:04:42.760 --> 00:04:48.590
 let's make a small example for 

00:04:45.340 --> 00:04:52.490
 that they see that if working 

00:04:48.590 --> 00:04:56.000
 both parties have been friendly 

00:04:52.490 --> 00:04:56.000
 as we can see 

00:04:57.920 --> 00:05:01.300
 let's go to the favorite team 

00:05:03.920 --> 00:05:06.730
 the people passing 

00:05:11.159 --> 00:05:15.989
 also this difference 

00:05:16.120 --> 00:05:21.879
 the classic 

00:05:18.050 --> 00:05:21.879
 as if you can reach me 

00:05:22.380 --> 00:05:28.880
 they will have christian martinoli the doctor 

00:05:24.420 --> 00:05:28.880
 GarcÃ­a his commentators in the Colosseum 

00:05:32.500 --> 00:05:36.129
 by this flame my brother who starts the 

00:05:34.150 --> 00:05:39.029
 match 

00:05:36.129 --> 00:05:39.029
 and this is 

00:05:55.220 --> 00:05:59.660
 like the brand 

00:05:56.790 --> 00:05:59.660
 meters and is soccer 

00:06:00.729 --> 00:06:03.059
 how 

00:06:27.360 --> 00:06:32.719
 If it works, I like to comment and
