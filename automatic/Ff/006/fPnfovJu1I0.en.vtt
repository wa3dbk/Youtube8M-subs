where 2010 was a year of real progress

00:00:14.880 --> 00:00:18.710 
where 2010 was a year of real progress
yeah<00:00:15.750> currently<00:00:16.230> we're<00:00:16.410> actually<00:00:17.570> 25%<00:00:18.570> of<00:00:18.600> the

the<00:00:25.529> plant<00:00:25.830> in<00:00:26.010> January<00:00:26.550> might<00:00:26.910> not<00:00:27.060> even

00:00:27.230 --> 00:00:27.240 
the plant in January might not even

00:00:27.240 --> 00:00:29.450 
the plant in January might not even
recognize<00:00:27.510> it<00:00:27.869> anymore<00:00:28.260> one<00:00:29.130> big<00:00:29.310> difference

00:00:29.450 --> 00:00:29.460 
recognize it anymore one big difference

00:00:29.460 --> 00:00:31.370 
recognize it anymore one big difference
would<00:00:29.880> be<00:00:29.910> that<00:00:30.029> we<00:00:30.300> have<00:00:30.510> walls<00:00:30.810> now<00:00:31.080> like

00:00:31.370 --> 00:00:31.380 
would be that we have walls now like

00:00:31.380 --> 00:00:32.720 
would be that we have walls now like
this<00:00:31.560> blast<00:00:31.800> containment<00:00:32.340> wall<00:00:32.460> on<00:00:32.610> the

walls<00:00:34.920> like<00:00:35.160> this<00:00:35.340> one<00:00:35.579> will<00:00:35.760> protect<00:00:36.090> workers

00:00:36.350 --> 00:00:36.360 
walls like this one will protect workers

00:00:36.360 --> 00:00:38.000 
walls like this one will protect workers
and<00:00:36.750> the<00:00:36.870> environment<00:00:36.899> in<00:00:37.620> the<00:00:37.770> unlikely

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:38.010 
and the environment in the unlikely

00:00:38.010 --> 00:00:39.979 
and the environment in the unlikely

event of an explosion during processing

00:00:39.989 --> 00:00:42.139 
event of an explosion during processing
workers<00:00:40.829> began<00:00:41.070> placing<00:00:41.430> these<00:00:41.700> walls<00:00:41.969> back

00:00:42.139 --> 00:00:42.149 
workers began placing these walls back

00:00:42.149 --> 00:00:44.299 
workers began placing these walls back
in<00:00:42.360> September<00:00:42.899> and<00:00:43.110> despite<00:00:43.559> the<00:00:43.739> cold<00:00:44.010> now

00:00:44.299 --> 00:00:44.309 
in September and despite the cold now

00:00:44.309 --> 00:00:45.860 
in September and despite the cold now
they'll<00:00:44.670> continue<00:00:45.059> placing<00:00:45.510> concrete

00:00:45.860 --> 00:00:45.870 
they'll continue placing concrete

00:00:45.870 --> 00:00:47.779 
they'll continue placing concrete
throughout<00:00:46.410> the<00:00:46.559> winter<00:00:46.680> we're<00:00:47.309> on<00:00:47.430> the<00:00:47.550> winds

00:00:47.779 --> 00:00:47.789 
throughout the winter we're on the winds

00:00:47.789 --> 00:00:49.670 
throughout the winter we're on the winds
of<00:00:47.850> carrying<00:00:48.149> conditions<00:00:48.629> so<00:00:49.410> we<00:00:49.530> have<00:00:49.649> a

00:00:49.670 --> 00:00:49.680 
of carrying conditions so we have a

00:00:49.680 --> 00:00:51.619 
of carrying conditions so we have a
heated<00:00:50.039> enclosure<00:00:50.399> we<00:00:50.850> have<00:00:50.940> blanketing<00:00:51.510> and

00:00:51.619 --> 00:00:51.629 
heated enclosure we have blanketing and

00:00:51.629 --> 00:00:53.630 
heated enclosure we have blanketing and
all<00:00:51.690> the<00:00:51.780> formwork<00:00:52.140> yeah<00:00:52.949> the<00:00:53.100> idea<00:00:53.489> is<00:00:53.610> to

00:00:53.630 --> 00:00:53.640 
all the formwork yeah the idea is to

00:00:53.640 --> 00:00:55.490 
all the formwork yeah the idea is to
adapt<00:00:54.059> to<00:00:54.360> the<00:00:54.480> conditions<00:00:54.600> that<00:00:55.140> you're<00:00:55.379> in

00:00:55.490 --> 00:00:55.500 
adapt to the conditions that you're in

00:00:55.500 --> 00:00:57.560 
adapt to the conditions that you're in
you're<00:00:55.649> facing<00:00:55.920> and<00:00:56.670> winter<00:00:56.969> conditions<00:00:57.449> have

00:00:57.560 --> 00:00:57.570 
you're facing and winter conditions have

00:00:57.570 --> 00:00:59.029 
you're facing and winter conditions have
already<00:00:57.809> gotten<00:00:57.989> pretty<00:00:58.289> harsh<00:00:58.530> this<00:00:58.800> year

00:00:59.029 --> 00:00:59.039 
already gotten pretty harsh this year

00:00:59.039 --> 00:01:00.590 
already gotten pretty harsh this year
with<00:00:59.190> single<00:00:59.520> digit<00:00:59.550> temperatures<00:01:00.090> and<00:01:00.510> a

00:01:00.590 --> 00:01:00.600 
with single digit temperatures and a

00:01:00.600 --> 00:01:02.540 
with single digit temperatures and a
good<00:01:00.780> amount<00:01:00.960> of<00:01:01.140> snow<00:01:01.320> accumulation<00:01:02.039> those

00:01:02.540 --> 00:01:02.550 
good amount of snow accumulation those

00:01:02.550 --> 00:01:04.009 
good amount of snow accumulation those
kind<00:01:02.789> of<00:01:02.879> conditions<00:01:03.090> make<00:01:03.570> it<00:01:03.719> hard<00:01:03.930> for

00:01:04.009 --> 00:01:04.019 
kind of conditions make it hard for

00:01:04.019 --> 00:01:05.630 
kind of conditions make it hard for
construction<00:01:04.589> workers<00:01:04.710> to<00:01:05.159> get<00:01:05.250> their<00:01:05.400> job

00:01:05.630 --> 00:01:05.640 
construction workers to get their job

00:01:05.640 --> 00:01:07.670 
construction workers to get their job
done<00:01:05.909> and<00:01:06.090> that's<00:01:06.570> why<00:01:06.810> progress<00:01:07.320> here<00:01:07.500> the

00:01:07.670 --> 00:01:07.680 
done and that's why progress here the

00:01:07.680 --> 00:01:09.530 
done and that's why progress here the
utility<00:01:08.130> building<00:01:08.340> has<00:01:08.640> been<00:01:08.820> so<00:01:09.000> important

00:01:09.530 --> 00:01:09.540 
utility building has been so important

00:01:09.540 --> 00:01:11.570 
utility building has been so important
it's<00:01:10.080> really<00:01:10.170> beneficial<00:01:10.619> to<00:01:11.070> be<00:01:11.310> able<00:01:11.369> to

00:01:11.570 --> 00:01:11.580 
it's really beneficial to be able to

00:01:11.580 --> 00:01:13.969 
it's really beneficial to be able to
have<00:01:11.760> indoor<00:01:12.270> work<00:01:12.600> as<00:01:12.840> well<00:01:13.049> as<00:01:13.200> outdoor<00:01:13.470> work
