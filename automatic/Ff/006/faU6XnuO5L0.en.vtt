set the plan out let's go ahead and dig

00:02:53.269 --> 00:02:57.970 
set the plan out let's go ahead and dig
our<00:02:53.420> hole<00:02:53.600> this<00:02:54.440> is<00:02:54.620> loosely<00:02:56.380> loose<00:02:57.380> soul<00:02:57.709> here

00:02:57.970 --> 00:02:57.980 
our hole this is loosely loose soul here

00:02:57.980 --> 00:02:59.890 
our hole this is loosely loose soul here
so<00:02:58.160> it's<00:02:58.310> not<00:02:58.430> going<00:02:58.550> to<00:02:58.640> be<00:02:58.700> a<00:02:58.730> problem<00:02:59.000> a<00:02:59.300> lot

00:02:59.890 --> 00:02:59.900 
so it's not going to be a problem a lot

00:02:59.900 --> 00:03:01.960 
so it's not going to be a problem a lot
of<00:02:59.930> people<00:03:00.110> plant<00:03:00.470> at<00:03:00.830> a<00:03:00.890> depth<00:03:01.220> lower<00:03:01.489> because

00:03:01.960 --> 00:03:01.970 
of people plant at a depth lower because

00:03:01.970 --> 00:03:04.090 
of people plant at a depth lower because
roots<00:03:02.390> will<00:03:02.600> shoot<00:03:02.810> out<00:03:02.959> I<00:03:03.200> plant<00:03:03.709> at<00:03:03.829> normal

00:03:04.090 --> 00:03:04.100 
roots will shoot out I plant at normal

00:03:04.100 --> 00:03:07.569 
roots will shoot out I plant at normal
depth<00:03:04.280> so<00:03:05.060> we<00:03:05.510> got<00:03:05.720> our<00:03:05.750> plant<00:03:06.560> their<00:03:06.829> fill<00:03:07.430> it

00:03:07.569 --> 00:03:07.579 
depth so we got our plant their fill it

00:03:07.579 --> 00:03:11.350 
depth so we got our plant their fill it
in<00:03:08.799> loosely<00:03:09.799> around<00:03:10.370> there<00:03:10.579> tuck<00:03:10.850> that<00:03:11.060> soul
