00:01:46.240 --> 00:01:46.250 
it's really important for young people

00:01:46.250 --> 00:01:48.609 
it's really important for young people
entering<00:01:46.910> the<00:01:47.000> industry<00:01:47.390> to<00:01:47.539> appreciate<00:01:48.410> the

entering the industry to appreciate the

00:01:48.619 --> 00:01:50.820 
entering the industry to appreciate the
importance<00:01:49.160> of<00:01:49.509> communication<00:01:50.509> and

00:01:50.820 --> 00:01:50.830 
importance of communication and

00:01:50.830 --> 00:01:53.589 
importance of communication and
understanding<00:01:51.830> the<00:01:52.190> terminologies<00:01:52.910> so<00:01:53.450> that

00:01:53.589 --> 00:01:53.599 
understanding the terminologies so that

00:01:53.599 --> 00:01:54.969 
understanding the terminologies so that
when<00:01:53.720> they're<00:01:53.869> talking<00:01:54.110> with<00:01:54.410> the<00:01:54.530> client

00:01:54.969 --> 00:01:54.979 
when they're talking with the client

00:01:54.979 --> 00:01:57.820 
when they're talking with the client
they<00:01:55.729> can<00:01:55.940> be<00:01:56.030> on<00:01:56.149> the<00:01:56.239> same<00:01:56.420> wavelength<00:01:56.800> so<00:01:57.800> a

00:01:57.820 --> 00:01:57.830 
they can be on the same wavelength so a

00:01:57.830 --> 00:01:59.740 
they can be on the same wavelength so a

because<00:03:15.010> there's<00:03:15.160> more<00:03:15.310> of<00:03:15.430> us<00:03:15.519> able<00:03:15.880> to<00:03:16.000> do<00:03:16.120> it

00:03:16.259 --> 00:03:16.269 
because there's more of us able to do it

00:03:16.269 --> 00:03:17.789 
because there's more of us able to do it
now<00:03:16.420> so<00:03:16.690> I<00:03:16.750> think<00:03:16.810> that's<00:03:17.079> a<00:03:17.200> huge<00:03:17.500> advantage

00:03:17.789 --> 00:03:17.799

to the market so that's alright yep
looks<00:03:21.519> good<00:03:21.730> to<00:03:21.880> me<00:03:21.910> you<00:03:22.269> have<00:03:22.420> it<00:03:22.540> with<00:03:22.660> that

00:03:22.770 --> 00:03:22.780 
looks good to me you have it with that

00:03:22.780 --> 00:03:25.080 
looks good to me you have it with that
yeah<00:03:23.850> great

00:03:25.080 --> 00:03:25.090 
yeah great

yeah great
oh<00:03:25.120> let's<00:03:25.480> send<00:03:25.720> it<00:03:25.810> down<00:03:25.959> to<00:03:26.079> the<00:03:26.170> plotter<00:03:26.410> and

00:03:26.490 --> 00:03:26.500 
oh let's send it down to the plotter and

00:03:26.500 --> 00:03:29.160 
oh let's send it down to the plotter and
take<00:03:26.769> it<00:03:26.890> from<00:03:26.950> there<00:03:27.540> once<00:03:28.540> the<00:03:28.660> product<00:03:29.109> has

00:05:10.269 --> 00:05:10.279 
well the qualification itself takes

00:05:10.279 --> 00:05:12.700 
well the qualification itself takes
about<00:05:10.460> three<00:05:10.999> years<00:05:11.300> but<00:05:11.599> if<00:05:11.960> you<00:05:12.139> are<00:05:12.289> for<00:05:12.620> it

00:05:12.700 --> 00:05:12.710 
about three years but if you are for it
