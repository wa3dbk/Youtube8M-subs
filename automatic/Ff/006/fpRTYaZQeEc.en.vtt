up<00:01:45.640> and<00:01:45.790> try<00:01:45.910> to<00:01:45.970> run<00:01:46.120> with<00:01:46.180> me<00:01:46.420> do<00:01:46.780> you<00:01:46.840> know

00:01:46.950 --> 00:01:46.960 
up and try to run with me do you know

00:01:46.960 --> 00:01:48.440 
up and try to run with me do you know
why<00:01:47.140> he<00:01:47.320> does<00:01:47.500> that

00:01:48.440 --> 00:01:48.450 
why he does that

00:01:48.450 --> 00:01:52.800 
why he does that
what<00:01:49.450> do<00:01:49.510> they<00:01:50.160> face<00:01:51.160> dodge<00:01:51.430> two<00:01:52.090> three<00:01:52.660> off

00:01:52.800 --> 00:01:52.810 
what do they face dodge two three off

00:01:52.810 --> 00:01:56.670 
what do they face dodge two three off
now<00:01:53.080> yeah<00:01:54.040> as<00:01:54.430> a<00:01:55.180> defensive<00:01:55.869> MIDI<00:01:56.170> what<00:01:56.470> we're

00:01:56.670 --> 00:01:56.680 
now yeah as a defensive MIDI what we're

00:01:56.680 --> 00:01:58.890 
now yeah as a defensive MIDI what we're
typically<00:01:57.490> taught<00:01:57.820> to<00:01:58.000> do<00:01:58.150> is<00:01:58.330> cut<00:01:58.540> the<00:01:58.630> field

00:01:58.890 --> 00:01:58.900 
typically taught to do is cut the field

00:01:58.900 --> 00:02:01.530 
typically taught to do is cut the field
at<00:01:59.200> Horsham<00:01:59.770> direction<00:02:00.310> all<00:02:00.970> right<00:02:01.060> so<00:02:01.300> the

00:02:01.530 --> 00:02:01.540 
at Horsham direction all right so the

00:02:01.540 --> 00:02:03.719 
at Horsham direction all right so the
reason<00:02:01.690> I<00:02:01.960> have<00:02:02.170> one<00:02:02.410> foot<00:02:02.650> up<00:02:02.800> field<00:02:03.070> is<00:02:03.520> I'm

00:02:03.719 --> 00:02:03.729 
reason I have one foot up field is I'm

00:02:03.729 --> 00:02:05.400 
reason I have one foot up field is I'm
trying<00:02:04.000> to<00:02:04.090> make<00:02:04.240> him<00:02:04.390> go<00:02:04.570> down<00:02:04.750> the<00:02:04.930> alley<00:02:05.110> and

00:02:05.400 --> 00:02:05.410 
trying to make him go down the alley and

00:02:05.410 --> 00:02:07.050 
trying to make him go down the alley and
you<00:02:05.619> might<00:02:05.890> already<00:02:06.100> want<00:02:06.490> to<00:02:06.550> go<00:02:06.610> down<00:02:06.850> that

00:02:07.050 --> 00:02:07.060 
you might already want to go down that

00:02:07.060 --> 00:02:09.810 
you might already want to go down that
way<00:02:07.270> but<00:02:07.899> the<00:02:08.020> thing<00:02:08.500> about<00:02:08.530> him<00:02:09.009> attacking<00:02:09.520> my

00:02:09.810 --> 00:02:09.820 
way but the thing about him attacking my

00:02:09.820 --> 00:02:12.420 
way but the thing about him attacking my
top<00:02:10.119> foot<00:02:10.420> is<00:02:10.959> it<00:02:11.170> pretty<00:02:11.380> much<00:02:11.500> squares<00:02:11.980> me<00:02:12.250> up

00:02:12.420 --> 00:02:12.430 
top foot is it pretty much squares me up

00:02:12.430 --> 00:02:14.550 
top foot is it pretty much squares me up
so<00:02:12.970> that<00:02:13.000> he<00:02:13.270> can<00:02:13.420> go<00:02:13.510> either<00:02:13.750> direction<00:02:13.900> it

00:02:14.550 --> 00:02:14.560 
so that he can go either direction it

00:02:14.560 --> 00:02:16.350 
so that he can go either direction it
makes<00:02:14.709> it<00:02:14.860> very<00:02:15.130> difficult<00:02:15.489> for<00:02:15.880> me<00:02:16.180> as<00:02:16.330> a

00:02:16.350 --> 00:02:16.360 
makes it very difficult for me as a

00:02:16.360 --> 00:02:18.960 
makes it very difficult for me as a
defensive<00:02:16.930> MIDI<00:02:17.170> if<00:02:17.770> I<00:02:17.950> get<00:02:18.160> squared<00:02:18.580> up<00:02:18.730> like

00:02:18.960 --> 00:02:18.970 
defensive MIDI if I get squared up like

00:02:18.970 --> 00:02:21.360 
defensive MIDI if I get squared up like
this<00:02:19.239> and<00:02:19.510> now<00:02:19.989> he<00:02:20.050> can<00:02:20.410> choose<00:02:20.770> wherever<00:02:21.070> he

00:02:21.360 --> 00:02:21.370 
this and now he can choose wherever he

00:02:21.370 --> 00:02:24.720 
this and now he can choose wherever he
wants<00:02:21.640> to<00:02:21.700> go<00:02:21.790> so<00:02:23.100> usually<00:02:24.100> what<00:02:24.220> happens<00:02:24.610> if

00:02:24.720 --> 00:02:24.730 
wants to go so usually what happens if

00:02:24.730 --> 00:02:26.400 
wants to go so usually what happens if
I'm<00:02:24.910> up<00:02:25.090> field<00:02:25.360> and<00:02:25.510> he<00:02:25.630> just<00:02:25.870> kind<00:02:26.140> of<00:02:26.200> goes

00:02:26.400 --> 00:02:26.410 
I'm up field and he just kind of goes

00:02:26.410 --> 00:02:28.650 
I'm up field and he just kind of goes
this<00:02:26.650> direction<00:02:26.709> I<00:02:27.430> could<00:02:27.700> just<00:02:28.060> fit<00:02:28.330> he<00:02:28.390> take

00:02:28.650 --> 00:02:28.660 
this direction I could just fit he take

00:02:28.660 --> 00:02:30.930 
this direction I could just fit he take
an<00:02:28.810> angle<00:02:29.200> make<00:02:29.620> contact<00:02:30.190> and<00:02:30.400> push<00:02:30.610> him<00:02:30.790> out

00:02:30.930 --> 00:02:30.940 
an angle make contact and push him out

00:02:30.940 --> 00:02:33.840 
an angle make contact and push him out
and<00:02:31.390> he's<00:02:31.540> got<00:02:31.750> a<00:02:31.780> bad<00:02:32.080> angle<00:02:32.470> at<00:02:32.590> the<00:02:32.920> goal<00:02:33.160> but

00:02:33.840 --> 00:02:33.850 
and he's got a bad angle at the goal but

00:02:33.850 --> 00:02:36.780 
and he's got a bad angle at the goal but
if<00:02:34.000> he<00:02:34.150> attacks<00:02:34.600> me<00:02:34.810> up<00:02:35.050> here<00:02:35.500> right<00:02:36.130> now<00:02:36.489> I<00:02:36.520> had

00:02:36.780 --> 00:02:36.790 
if he attacks me up here right now I had

00:02:36.790 --> 00:02:39.780 
if he attacks me up here right now I had
to<00:02:36.910> backpedal<00:02:37.260> and<00:02:38.260> what<00:02:38.410> happens<00:02:38.830> is<00:02:39.010> I<00:02:39.250> can't

00:02:39.780 --> 00:02:39.790 
to backpedal and what happens is I can't

00:02:39.790 --> 00:02:41.970 
to backpedal and what happens is I can't
turn<00:02:39.970> around<00:02:40.150> and<00:02:40.360> run<00:02:40.510> play<00:02:41.110> defense<00:02:41.620> as<00:02:41.769> well

00:02:41.970 --> 00:02:41.980 
turn around and run play defense as well

00:02:41.980 --> 00:02:44.759 
turn around and run play defense as well
and<00:02:42.459> he<00:02:42.760> has<00:02:42.850> the<00:02:42.970> option<00:02:43.120> to<00:02:43.420> go<00:02:43.540> each<00:02:43.720> side<00:02:44.019> so

00:02:44.759 --> 00:02:44.769 
and he has the option to go each side so

00:02:44.769 --> 00:02:46.560 
and he has the option to go each side so
make<00:02:45.220> sure<00:02:45.250> you're<00:02:45.519> attacking<00:02:45.790> that<00:02:46.060> top<00:02:46.299> foot

00:02:46.560 --> 00:02:46.570 
make sure you're attacking that top foot

00:02:46.570 --> 00:02:48.570 
make sure you're attacking that top foot
make<00:02:47.170> sure<00:02:47.350> that<00:02:47.500> the<00:02:47.650> defenseman<00:02:48.370> is

00:02:48.570 --> 00:02:48.580 
make sure that the defenseman is

00:02:48.580 --> 00:02:50.430 
make sure that the defenseman is
starting<00:02:48.940> back<00:02:49.150> little<00:02:49.600> a<00:02:49.630> little<00:02:49.720> bit<00:02:50.019> and

00:02:50.430 --> 00:02:50.440 
starting back little a little bit and

00:02:50.440 --> 00:02:51.690 
starting back little a little bit and
then<00:02:50.590> you<00:02:50.709> can<00:02:50.739> pretty<00:02:51.040> much<00:02:51.130> do<00:02:51.459> what<00:02:51.580> you

00:02:51.690 --> 00:02:51.700 
then you can pretty much do what you

00:02:51.700 --> 00:02:54.750 
then you can pretty much do what you
want<00:02:52.470> this<00:02:53.470> is<00:02:53.680> the<00:02:53.709> majority<00:02:54.010> of<00:02:54.340> us<00:02:54.519> who

00:02:54.750 --> 00:02:54.760 
want this is the majority of us who

00:02:54.760 --> 00:02:56.520 
want this is the majority of us who
hears<00:02:54.970> many<00:02:55.150> our<00:02:55.330> defensive<00:02:55.840> razor<00:02:55.989> stake

00:02:56.520 --> 00:02:56.530 
hears many our defensive razor stake

00:02:56.530 --> 00:02:58.620 
hears many our defensive razor stake
okay<00:02:57.130> so<00:02:57.250> if<00:02:57.640> he's<00:02:57.850> running<00:02:58.120> at<00:02:58.180> full<00:02:58.330> speed

00:02:58.620 --> 00:02:58.630 
okay so if he's running at full speed

00:02:58.630 --> 00:02:59.880 
okay so if he's running at full speed
what's<00:02:58.900> one<00:02:59.080> thing<00:02:59.110> we've<00:02:59.470> just<00:02:59.680> learned

00:02:59.880 --> 00:02:59.890 
what's one thing we've just learned

00:02:59.890 --> 00:03:01.199 
what's one thing we've just learned
without<00:03:00.220> him<00:03:00.370> having<00:03:00.549> the<00:03:00.760> same<00:03:00.970> as<00:03:01.180> a

00:03:01.199 --> 00:03:01.209 
without him having the same as a

00:03:01.209 --> 00:03:03.090 
without him having the same as a
defenseman<00:03:01.690> we<00:03:02.440> want<00:03:02.590> to<00:03:02.650> stand<00:03:02.860> still<00:03:02.950> and

00:03:03.090 --> 00:03:03.100 
defenseman we want to stand still and

00:03:03.100 --> 00:03:05.220 
defenseman we want to stand still and
start<00:03:03.400> moving<00:03:03.489> all<00:03:04.480> right<00:03:04.630> so<00:03:04.810> we<00:03:04.959> want<00:03:05.140> to

00:03:05.220 --> 00:03:05.230 
start moving all right so we want to

00:03:05.230 --> 00:03:06.720 
start moving all right so we want to
start<00:03:05.440> a<00:03:05.500> little<00:03:05.620> bit<00:03:05.709> higher<00:03:06.010> so<00:03:06.310> as<00:03:06.519> the

00:03:06.720 --> 00:03:06.730 
start a little bit higher so as the

00:03:06.730 --> 00:03:08.130 
start a little bit higher so as the
dodge<00:03:06.880> comes<00:03:07.209> we<00:03:07.360> could<00:03:07.480> start<00:03:07.720> moving

00:03:08.130 --> 00:03:08.140 
dodge comes we could start moving

00:03:08.140 --> 00:03:09.720 
dodge comes we could start moving
backwards<00:03:08.799> all<00:03:09.370> right

00:03:09.720 --> 00:03:09.730 
backwards all right

00:03:09.730 --> 00:03:11.550 
backwards all right
gaining<00:03:10.120> some<00:03:10.510> type<00:03:10.690> of<00:03:10.720> speed<00:03:11.170> instead<00:03:11.470> of

00:03:11.550 --> 00:03:11.560 
gaining some type of speed instead of

00:03:11.560 --> 00:03:13.229 
gaining some type of speed instead of
nothing<00:03:11.769> better<00:03:12.220> than<00:03:12.430> for<00:03:12.910> me<00:03:13.030> as<00:03:13.150> an

00:03:13.229 --> 00:03:13.239 
nothing better than for me as an

00:03:13.239 --> 00:03:14.580 
nothing better than for me as an
offensive<00:03:13.510> player<00:03:13.630> seeing<00:03:14.049> a<00:03:14.110> defense<00:03:14.440> for

00:03:14.580 --> 00:03:14.590 
offensive player seeing a defense for

00:03:14.590 --> 00:03:15.960 
offensive player seeing a defense for
just<00:03:14.739> a<00:03:14.829> flat<00:03:15.100> foot<00:03:15.220> if<00:03:15.340> there's<00:03:15.519> no<00:03:15.730> way<00:03:15.880> you

00:03:15.960 --> 00:03:15.970 
just a flat foot if there's no way you

00:03:15.970 --> 00:03:16.800 
just a flat foot if there's no way you
could<00:03:16.090> defend<00:03:16.269> that

00:03:16.800 --> 00:03:16.810 
could defend that

00:03:16.810 --> 00:03:18.690 
could defend that
coming<00:03:17.110> full<00:03:17.319> steam<00:03:17.560> ahead<00:03:18.010> so<00:03:18.280> you<00:03:18.489> got<00:03:18.610> to

00:03:18.690 --> 00:03:18.700 
coming full steam ahead so you got to

00:03:18.700 --> 00:03:21.180

aim<00:04:13.060> it's<00:04:13.420> a<00:04:13.510> lot<00:04:13.660> harder<00:04:13.930> for<00:04:14.049> him<00:04:14.230> to
