 If I do, I understand this option. 

00:02:28.810 --> 00:02:31.780
 You do not even need to talk on the internet. 

00:02:31.239 --> 00:02:37.030
 use 

00:02:31.780 --> 00:02:40.389
 beauty is this is what matters that the 

00:02:37.030 --> 00:02:41.650
 Only thing that matters is is this 

00:02:40.389 --> 00:02:45.069
 business here that you will choose 

00:02:41.650 --> 00:02:46.569
 Where is he going to stay ? 

00:02:45.069 --> 00:02:48.819
 I like to always leave this corner 

00:02:46.569 --> 00:02:50.709
 here below right 

00:02:48.819 --> 00:02:52.780
 This you do not mark for the love of 

00:02:50.709 --> 00:02:55.239
 God he will stop recording when 

00:02:52.780 --> 00:02:57.549
 reaches 60 seconds does not mark for love 

00:02:55.239 --> 00:03:00.310
 This is not what this is about god either. 

00:02:57.549 --> 00:03:03.189
 say and move I advise you to leave it 

00:03:00.310 --> 00:03:06.939
 set up your computer 

00:03:03.189 --> 00:03:09.400
 your computer will not be flex at 50 fps 

00:03:06.939 --> 00:03:12.400
 Do you have a computer up with 4 

00:03:09.400 --> 00:03:14.169
 gb of ram and I do not know a core 2 duo you already 

00:03:12.400 --> 00:03:16.299
 can leave 50 fps 

00:03:14.169 --> 00:03:20.079
 But in case the second one sucks, fuck it. 

00:03:16.299 --> 00:03:21.459
 above that you leave at 60fps or 

00:03:20.079 --> 00:03:24.760
 Do you think you're getting a little? 

00:03:21.459 --> 00:03:26.530
 slow you down here 30fps or case 

00:03:24.760 --> 00:03:28.689
 you want to configure otherwise 

00:03:26.530 --> 00:03:30.159
 more or less you digit option marks 

00:03:28.689 --> 00:03:33.129
 both the species you want can 

00:03:30.159 --> 00:03:36.849
 put up to 88 thousand if you want but I 

00:03:33.129 --> 00:03:39.400
 I always leave it at 50 fps beauty here 

00:03:36.849 --> 00:03:43.120
 You leave officers who will record on HD 

00:03:39.400 --> 00:03:47.470
 here the sound here is what he 

00:03:43.120 --> 00:03:49.989
 will record the sound of the game, I will not 

00:03:47.470 --> 00:03:52.359
 always stereo even if you mark this 

00:03:49.989 --> 00:03:58.000
 option and will start recording to your 

00:03:52.359 --> 00:03:59.859
 microphone plus the sound of the game and that's it 

00:03:58.000 --> 00:04:02.109
 that I make or leave these two marked 

00:03:59.859 --> 00:04:04.359
 and decrease the sound of the game there in the own 

00:04:02.109 --> 00:04:06.790
 play to my microphone do not stay one 

00:04:04.359 --> 00:04:07.389
 slightly below the very high game sound 

00:04:06.790 --> 00:04:10.540

00:04:07.389 --> 00:04:13.030
 and this option here what is the f91 the option 

00:04:10.540 --> 00:04:15.040
 It's the key you're going to use to get started. 

00:04:13.030 --> 00:04:17.500

00:04:15.040 --> 00:04:19.359
