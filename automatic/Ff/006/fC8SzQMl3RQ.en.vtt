 The arrangement is that you experience the city 

00:00:10.779 --> 00:00:12.779
 at least it is 

00:00:12.779 --> 00:00:16.179

00:00:22.640 --> 00:00:24.119
 so functionality 

00:00:24.119 --> 00:00:27.220

00:01:26.370 --> 00:01:29.420
 this just as important how feel 

00:01:29.420 --> 00:01:31.510
 how fruitful a motion 

00:01:31.510 --> 00:01:34.110

00:01:34.110 --> 00:01:36.460
