00:03:32.330 --> 00:03:32.340 
see if that a picture of a 63 year old

00:03:32.340 --> 00:03:34.070 
see if that a picture of a 63 year old
woman<00:03:32.610> who<00:03:32.910> looks<00:03:33.090> like<00:03:33.180> she's<00:03:33.480> about<00:03:33.510> 30

00:03:34.070 --> 00:03:34.080 
woman who looks like she's about 30

00:03:34.080 --> 00:03:36.170 
woman who looks like she's about 30
she's<00:03:34.770> been<00:03:34.890> off<00:03:35.130> for<00:03:35.280> 30<00:03:35.430> years<00:03:35.670> what<00:03:36.150> I've

00:03:36.170 --> 00:03:36.180 
she's been off for 30 years what I've

00:03:36.180 --> 00:03:38.690 
she's been off for 30 years what I've
noticed<00:03:36.480> is<00:03:36.720> that<00:03:36.780> people<00:03:37.230> often<00:03:37.410> they<00:03:38.220> the

00:03:38.690 --> 00:03:38.700 
noticed is that people often they the

00:03:38.700 --> 00:03:41.210 
noticed is that people often they the
aging<00:03:39.090> process<00:03:39.210> slows<00:03:39.990> down<00:03:40.380> when<00:03:40.440> you<00:03:40.800> go<00:03:40.980> raw

00:03:41.210 --> 00:03:41.220 
aging process slows down when you go raw

00:03:41.220 --> 00:03:43.310 
aging process slows down when you go raw
so<00:03:41.580> people<00:03:41.970> often<00:03:42.120> look<00:03:42.480> very<00:03:42.780> close<00:03:43.050> to<00:03:43.290> the

00:03:43.310 --> 00:03:43.320 
so people often look very close to the

00:03:43.320 --> 00:03:45.070 
so people often look very close to the
age<00:03:43.620> that<00:03:43.980> they<00:03:44.160> were<00:03:44.400> when<00:03:44.700> they<00:03:44.820> started

00:03:45.070 --> 00:03:45.080 
age that they were when they started

00:03:45.080 --> 00:03:48.860 
age that they were when they started
it's<00:03:46.080> not<00:03:46.230> younger<00:03:46.550> i<00:03:47.550> also<00:03:47.850> have<00:03:48.150> an<00:03:48.300> 81<00:03:48.840> year

00:03:48.860 --> 00:03:48.870 
it's not younger i also have an 81 year

okay<00:05:15.180> so<00:05:15.780> I<00:05:15.810> was<00:05:16.320> basically<00:05:16.949> promoted<00:05:17.850> as<00:05:18.060> a

00:05:18.110 --> 00:05:18.120 
okay so I was basically promoted as a

00:05:18.120 --> 00:05:21.860 
okay so I was basically promoted as a
healthy<00:05:18.870> roof<00:05:19.080> because<00:05:19.919> um<00:05:20.310> the<00:05:21.210> industry<00:05:21.780> it

00:05:21.860 --> 00:05:21.870 
healthy roof because um the industry it

00:05:21.870 --> 00:05:24.350 
healthy roof because um the industry it
was<00:05:21.990> an<00:05:22.080> industrial<00:05:22.800> waste<00:05:23.550> product<00:05:24.030> that<00:05:24.180> the

00:05:24.350 --> 00:05:24.360 
was an industrial waste product that the

00:05:24.360 --> 00:05:26.360 
was an industrial waste product that the
protein<00:05:24.720> part<00:05:25.020> so<00:05:25.530> they<00:05:25.680> plotted<00:05:26.130> a<00:05:26.160> waste

00:05:26.360 --> 00:05:26.370 
protein part so they plotted a waste

00:05:26.370 --> 00:05:27.860 
protein part so they plotted a waste
product<00:05:26.699> but<00:05:26.880> what<00:05:27.060> was<00:05:27.210> it<00:05:27.360> maybe<00:05:27.600> paint

00:05:27.860 --> 00:05:27.870 
product but what was it maybe paint

00:05:27.870 --> 00:05:30.800 
product but what was it maybe paint
DuPont<00:05:28.530> was<00:05:28.590> using<00:05:29.039> the<00:05:29.310> i<00:05:29.699> guess<00:05:30.360> the<00:05:30.389> fat

00:05:30.800 --> 00:05:30.810 
DuPont was using the i guess the fat

00:05:30.810 --> 00:05:32.540 
DuPont was using the i guess the fat
from<00:05:31.020> the<00:05:31.110> soy<00:05:31.350> or<00:05:31.500> something<00:05:31.830> for<00:05:32.070> pink<00:05:32.370> and

00:05:32.540 --> 00:05:32.550 
from the soy or something for pink and

00:05:32.550 --> 00:05:35.719 
from the soy or something for pink and
so<00:05:33.180> they<00:05:33.660> wanted<00:05:33.960> to<00:05:34.110> you<00:05:34.919> know<00:05:34.949> make<00:05:35.460> money

00:05:35.719 --> 00:05:35.729 
so they wanted to you know make money

00:05:35.729 --> 00:05:37.700 
so they wanted to you know make money
off<00:05:35.910> of<00:05:36.150> the<00:05:36.240> waste<00:05:36.419> product<00:05:36.840> so<00:05:37.380> they

00:05:37.700 --> 00:05:37.710 
off of the waste product so they

00:05:37.710 --> 00:05:39.830 
off of the waste product so they
brainwash<00:05:38.490> everybody<00:05:38.940> into<00:05:39.270> thinking<00:05:39.660> this

00:05:39.830 --> 00:05:39.840 
brainwash everybody into thinking this
