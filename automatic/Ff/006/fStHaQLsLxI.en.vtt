welcome<00:00:10.620> to<00:00:10.710> your<00:00:10.800> ESC<00:00:11.370> demonstration<00:00:12.030> i'm

00:00:12.740 --> 00:00:12.750 
welcome to your ESC demonstration i'm

00:00:12.750 --> 00:00:14.060 
welcome to your ESC demonstration i'm
fillin<00:00:13.139> i'll<00:00:13.259> look<00:00:13.380> after<00:00:13.530> you<00:00:13.710> for<00:00:13.799> the<00:00:13.889> next

fillin i'll look after you for the next
couple<00:00:14.219> of<00:00:14.370> minutes<00:00:14.580> the<00:00:14.759> idea<00:00:15.059> of<00:00:15.150> the

00:00:15.230 --> 00:00:15.240 
couple of minutes the idea of the

couple of minutes the idea of the
exercise<00:00:15.630> now<00:00:15.870> is<00:00:16.230> to<00:00:16.379> get<00:00:16.500> a<00:00:16.529> feel<00:00:16.830> for<00:00:17.460> how

00:00:17.630 --> 00:00:17.640 
exercise now is to get a feel for how

00:00:17.640 --> 00:00:19.990 
exercise now is to get a feel for how
ESC<00:00:18.270> intervenes<00:00:18.840> in<00:00:18.990> a<00:00:19.050> critical<00:00:19.500> situation

00:00:19.990 --> 00:00:20.000 
ESC intervenes in a critical situation

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:22.189 
ESC intervenes in a critical situation
we're<00:00:21.000> going<00:00:21.119> to<00:00:21.180> drive<00:00:21.359> through<00:00:21.570> a<00:00:21.689> critical

end-user we've broken into the ECU in
order<00:00:29.070> to<00:00:29.189> help<00:00:29.310> demonstrate<00:00:29.730> a<00:00:30.269> that<00:00:30.869> this<00:00:30.990> is

00:00:31.099 --> 00:00:31.109 
order to help demonstrate a that this is

00:00:31.109 --> 00:00:33.740 
order to help demonstrate a that this is
a<00:00:31.140> stable<00:00:31.439> vehicle<00:00:32.009> but<00:00:32.250> also<00:00:32.309> how<00:00:33.149> important

00:00:33.740 --> 00:00:33.750 
a stable vehicle but also how important

00:00:33.750 --> 00:00:36.049 
a stable vehicle but also how important
and<00:00:33.899> how<00:00:34.010> effective<00:00:35.010> the<00:00:35.219> ESC<00:00:35.579> is<00:00:35.610> when<00:00:35.940> it's

00:00:36.049 --> 00:00:36.059 
and how effective the ESC is when it's

00:00:36.059 --> 00:00:37.970 
and how effective the ESC is when it's
switched<00:00:36.180> back<00:00:36.540> in<00:00:36.780> so<00:00:37.290> you<00:00:37.320> can<00:00:37.500> get<00:00:37.620> a<00:00:37.649> feel

00:00:37.970 --> 00:00:37.980 
switched back in so you can get a feel

00:00:37.980 --> 00:00:40.639 
switched back in so you can get a feel
firsthand<00:00:38.550> of<00:00:39.000> how<00:00:39.540> these<00:00:39.719> systems<00:00:39.960> operate

00:00:40.639 --> 00:00:40.649 
firsthand of how these systems operate

00:00:40.649 --> 00:00:43.490 
firsthand of how these systems operate
what<00:00:41.399> they<00:00:41.579> do<00:00:41.640> it<00:00:41.850> and<00:00:42.030> how<00:00:42.210> they<00:00:42.390> do<00:00:42.450> in<00:00:43.290> order

00:00:43.490 --> 00:00:43.500 
what they do it and how they do in order

00:00:43.500 --> 00:00:46.010 
what they do it and how they do in order
to<00:00:43.649> have<00:00:44.010> ESC<00:00:44.610> you<00:00:44.879> require<00:00:45.239> abs<00:00:45.719> and<00:00:45.989> traction

00:00:46.010 --> 00:00:46.020 
to have ESC you require abs and traction

00:00:46.020 --> 00:00:47.720 
to have ESC you require abs and traction
control<00:00:46.350> so<00:00:46.829> these<00:00:46.950> vehicles<00:00:47.190> are<00:00:47.399> fitted<00:00:47.610> for

00:00:47.720 --> 00:00:47.730 
control so these vehicles are fitted for

00:00:47.730 --> 00:00:50.600 
control so these vehicles are fitted for
both<00:00:47.879> of<00:00:48.030> those<00:00:48.149> things<00:00:48.390> it's<00:00:49.379> also<00:00:49.620> that

00:00:50.600 --> 00:00:50.610 
both of those things it's also that

00:00:50.610 --> 00:00:51.950 
both of those things it's also that
gives<00:00:50.820> you<00:00:50.910> the<00:00:51.030> wheel<00:00:51.210> speed<00:00:51.480> sensor<00:00:51.870> from

that<00:01:10.650> you're<00:01:10.920> driving<00:01:11.460> the<00:01:11.670> vehicle<00:01:12.619> it<00:01:13.619> has

00:01:13.730 --> 00:01:13.740 
that you're driving the vehicle it has

00:01:13.740 --> 00:01:15.740 
that you're driving the vehicle it has
no<00:01:13.890> personality<00:01:14.130> it's<00:01:14.909> not<00:01:15.030> thinking<00:01:15.540> about

00:01:15.740 --> 00:01:15.750 
no personality it's not thinking about

00:01:15.750 --> 00:01:17.840 
no personality it's not thinking about
what's<00:01:15.960> ahead<00:01:16.110> all<00:01:16.680> the<00:01:17.009> system<00:01:17.340> is<00:01:17.430> doing<00:01:17.700> is

00:01:17.840 --> 00:01:17.850 
what's ahead all the system is doing is

00:01:17.850 --> 00:01:19.760 
what's ahead all the system is doing is
recognizing<00:01:18.060> if<00:01:18.689> the<00:01:18.840> vehicle<00:01:19.500> is<00:01:19.530> going

00:01:19.760 --> 00:01:19.770 
recognizing if the vehicle is going

00:01:19.770 --> 00:01:21.590 
recognizing if the vehicle is going
where<00:01:20.159> the<00:01:20.280> drivers<00:01:20.640> are<00:01:20.759> steering<00:01:21.270> the

vehicle if that's not the case it will

00:01:23.939 --> 00:01:26.300 
vehicle if that's not the case it will
intervene<00:01:24.530> and<00:01:25.530> I'll<00:01:25.680> talk<00:01:25.920> more<00:01:25.950> about<00:01:26.130> that

00:01:26.300 --> 00:01:26.310 
intervene and I'll talk more about that

00:01:26.310 --> 00:01:28.039 
intervene and I'll talk more about that
when<00:01:26.700> you<00:01:26.790> feel<00:01:26.970> the<00:01:27.119> intervention<00:01:27.689> but<00:01:27.900> for

00:01:28.039 --> 00:01:28.049 
when you feel the intervention but for

00:01:28.049 --> 00:01:29.120 
when you feel the intervention but for
the<00:01:28.110> time<00:01:28.290> being<00:01:28.320> we're<00:01:28.590> going<00:01:28.710> to<00:01:28.770> drive<00:01:28.920> into

00:01:29.120 --> 00:01:29.130 
the time being we're going to drive into

00:01:29.130 --> 00:01:31.010 
the time being we're going to drive into
the<00:01:29.520> critical<00:01:29.880> situation<00:01:30.060> perhaps<00:01:30.630> the<00:01:30.840> child

00:01:31.010 --> 00:01:31.020 
the critical situation perhaps the child

00:01:31.020 --> 00:01:32.480 
the critical situation perhaps the child
steps<00:01:31.350> off<00:01:31.470> a<00:01:31.560> pavement<00:01:31.799> in<00:01:32.040> front<00:01:32.280> of<00:01:32.400> us

00:01:32.480 --> 00:01:32.490 
steps off a pavement in front of us

00:01:32.490 --> 00:01:35.030 
steps off a pavement in front of us
we're<00:01:33.270> going<00:01:33.360> to<00:01:33.450> use<00:01:33.659> about<00:01:34.320> 40<00:01:34.710> miles<00:01:34.890> an

00:01:35.030 --> 00:01:35.040 
we're going to use about 40 miles an

00:01:35.040 --> 00:01:43.530 
we're going to use about 40 miles an
hour<00:01:35.189> okay<00:01:36.380> here<00:01:37.380> we<00:01:37.470> go

00:01:43.530 --> 00:01:43.540 

00:01:43.540 --> 00:01:46.140 

so<00:01:44.080> we'll<00:01:44.230> use<00:01:44.320> a<00:01:44.350> normal<00:01:44.740> road<00:01:44.890> speed<00:01:45.280> 40<00:01:46.060> odd

00:01:46.140 --> 00:01:46.150 
so we'll use a normal road speed 40 odd

00:01:46.150 --> 00:01:48.300 
so we'll use a normal road speed 40 odd
miles<00:01:46.360> an<00:01:46.540> hour<00:01:46.690> nominally<00:01:47.290> it's<00:01:48.190> not

00:01:48.300 --> 00:01:48.310 
miles an hour nominally it's not

00:01:48.310 --> 00:01:49.770 
miles an hour nominally it's not
critical<00:01:48.520> it'll<00:01:48.970> work<00:01:49.090> at<00:01:49.240> any<00:01:49.330> speed<00:01:49.630> it's

00:01:49.770 --> 00:01:49.780 
critical it'll work at any speed it's

00:01:49.780 --> 00:01:51.620 
critical it'll work at any speed it's
just<00:01:49.960> that<00:01:50.080> that's<00:01:50.200> a<00:01:50.290> nice<00:01:50.410> one<00:01:50.650> for<00:01:50.680> us<00:01:50.920> to

00:01:51.620 --> 00:01:51.630 
just that that's a nice one for us to

00:01:51.630 --> 00:01:54.150 
just that that's a nice one for us to
enable<00:01:52.630> to<00:01:52.870> demonstration<00:01:53.410> situation<00:01:54.010> so

00:01:54.150 --> 00:01:54.160 
enable to demonstration situation so

00:01:54.160 --> 00:01:55.500 
enable to demonstration situation so
about<00:01:54.340> forty<00:01:54.700> four<00:01:54.820> forty<00:01:54.880> three<00:01:55.240> miles<00:01:55.390> now

so shortly we're going to do exactly the

00:02:27.010 --> 00:02:28.980 
so shortly we're going to do exactly the

00:02:28.980 --> 00:02:28.990 
same exercise with the system switched

00:02:28.990 --> 00:02:30.780 
same exercise with the system switched
on<00:02:29.200> I'm<00:02:29.650> going<00:02:29.800> to<00:02:29.890> endeavour<00:02:30.310> to<00:02:30.370> drive<00:02:30.670> at

00:02:30.780 --> 00:02:30.790 
on I'm going to endeavour to drive at

00:02:30.790 --> 00:02:33.270 
on I'm going to endeavour to drive at
the<00:02:30.850> same<00:02:31.120> speed<00:02:31.620> with<00:02:32.620> the<00:02:32.710> same<00:02:32.980> steering

00:02:33.270 --> 00:02:33.280 
the same speed with the same steering

00:02:33.280 --> 00:02:35.310 
the same speed with the same steering
inputs<00:02:33.670> on<00:02:33.790> the<00:02:33.820> same<00:02:34.210> surface<00:02:34.510> we<00:02:34.959> should<00:02:35.140> see

00:02:35.310 --> 00:02:35.320 
inputs on the same surface we should see

00:02:35.320 --> 00:02:39.030 
inputs on the same surface we should see
quite<00:02:35.650> a<00:02:35.680> different<00:02:36.190> outcome<00:02:37.680> so<00:02:38.680> this<00:02:38.830> time

00:02:39.030 --> 00:02:39.040 
quite a different outcome so this time

00:02:39.040 --> 00:02:41.250 
quite a different outcome so this time
we<00:02:39.160> use<00:02:39.280> the<00:02:39.400> same<00:02:39.610> speed<00:02:39.940> the<00:02:40.360> ESP<00:02:40.840> system<00:02:40.990> is

00:02:41.250 --> 00:02:41.260 
we use the same speed the ESP system is

00:02:41.260 --> 00:02:44.580 
we use the same speed the ESP system is
switched<00:02:41.530> on<00:02:42.660> Martin's<00:02:43.660> safe<00:02:43.900> and<00:02:44.110> clear<00:02:44.290> so

00:02:44.580 --> 00:02:44.590 
switched on Martin's safe and clear so

00:02:44.590 --> 00:02:47.040 
switched on Martin's safe and clear so
out<00:02:44.860> we<00:02:44.980> go<00:02:45.130> I'll<00:02:45.790> try<00:02:46.120> and<00:02:46.270> recreate<00:02:46.630> the<00:02:46.870> same

00:02:47.040 --> 00:02:47.050 
out we go I'll try and recreate the same

00:02:47.050 --> 00:02:48.540 
out we go I'll try and recreate the same
speed<00:02:47.320> just<00:02:47.530> over<00:02:47.770> 40<00:02:48.070> I<00:02:48.100> think<00:02:48.160> we're<00:02:48.400> about

00:02:48.540 --> 00:02:48.550 
speed just over 40 I think we're about

00:02:48.550 --> 00:02:50.720 
speed just over 40 I think we're about
42<00:02:48.970> 43

00:02:50.720 --> 00:02:50.730 
42 43

00:02:50.730 --> 00:02:53.360 
42 43
same<00:02:51.330> surface<00:02:51.569> conditions

00:02:53.360 --> 00:02:53.370 
same surface conditions

00:02:53.370 --> 00:02:56.800 
same surface conditions
same<00:02:54.000> steering<00:02:54.420> inputs<00:02:54.750> for<00:02:55.020> being<00:02:55.200> well

00:02:56.800 --> 00:02:56.810 
same steering inputs for being well

00:02:56.810 --> 00:02:58.900 
same steering inputs for being well
so<00:02:57.350> we<00:02:57.440> cruise<00:02:57.709> into<00:02:57.920> our<00:02:58.100> critical<00:02:58.430> situation

00:02:58.900 --> 00:02:58.910 
so we cruise into our critical situation

00:02:58.910 --> 00:03:00.250 
so we cruise into our critical situation
have<00:02:59.090> been<00:02:59.209> minding<00:02:59.450> our<00:02:59.540> own<00:02:59.600> business

00:03:00.250 --> 00:03:00.260

everything's<00:03:01.130> well<00:03:01.310> with<00:03:01.459> the<00:03:01.520> world<00:03:01.670> and<00:03:01.730> all

that<00:03:32.420> we<00:03:32.540> all<00:03:32.630> park<00:03:32.900> because<00:03:33.290> we<00:03:33.380> can't<00:03:33.590> get<00:03:33.769> to

00:03:33.910 --> 00:03:33.920 
that we all park because we can't get to

00:03:33.920 --> 00:03:38.050 
that we all park because we can't get to
the<00:03:34.010> aisle<00:03:34.760> we<00:03:35.030> need<00:03:35.239> to<00:03:35.390> get<00:03:35.570> to<00:03:36.850> so<00:03:37.850> what<00:03:37.970> the

00:03:38.050 --> 00:03:38.060 
the aisle we need to get to so what the

00:03:38.060 --> 00:03:39.130 
the aisle we need to get to so what the
system's<00:03:38.360> doing<00:03:38.630> is<00:03:38.690> very<00:03:38.780> straightforward

00:03:39.130 --> 00:03:39.140 
system's doing is very straightforward

00:03:39.140 --> 00:03:40.870 
system's doing is very straightforward
the<00:03:39.530> way<00:03:39.650> it<00:03:39.739> does<00:03:39.860> it<00:03:40.010> is<00:03:40.100> very<00:03:40.280> complex<00:03:40.670> but

00:03:40.870 --> 00:03:40.880 
the way it does it is very complex but

00:03:40.880 --> 00:03:42.370 
the way it does it is very complex but
we<00:03:40.940> don't<00:03:41.150> need<00:03:41.269> to<00:03:41.330> know<00:03:41.540> about<00:03:41.660> complexities

00:03:42.370 --> 00:03:42.380 
we don't need to know about complexities

00:03:42.380 --> 00:03:45.160 
we don't need to know about complexities
really<00:03:42.680> and<00:03:43.580> they<00:03:43.700> are<00:03:43.880> ESC<00:03:44.630> does<00:03:44.840> exactly

00:03:45.160 --> 00:03:45.170 
really and they are ESC does exactly

00:03:45.170 --> 00:03:48.100

what<00:03:45.350> it<00:03:45.590> says<00:03:45.620> all<00:03:45.830> it<00:03:45.950> is
