person<00:00:30.750> and<00:00:30.929> they<00:00:30.990> were<00:00:31.050> giving<00:00:31.619> us<00:00:31.710> a<00:00:31.800> bit<00:00:31.949> of

person and they were giving us a bit of

00:00:32.040 --> 00:00:34.040 
person and they were giving us a bit of
trouble<00:00:32.369> but<00:00:32.550> how<00:00:33.270> they<00:00:33.480> finished<00:00:33.809> the<00:00:33.930> game

00:00:34.040 --> 00:00:34.050 
trouble but how they finished the game

00:00:34.050 --> 00:00:35.540 
trouble but how they finished the game
today<00:00:34.230> was<00:00:34.440> magnificent<00:00:34.620> was<00:00:35.070> really<00:00:35.370> good

00:00:35.540 --> 00:00:35.550 
today was magnificent was really good

00:00:35.550 --> 00:00:37.580 
today was magnificent was really good
but<00:00:35.880> you<00:00:36.360> know<00:00:36.450> it<00:00:36.719> actually<00:00:36.870> did<00:00:37.170> have<00:00:37.290> really

00:00:37.580 --> 00:00:37.590 
but you know it actually did have really

00:00:37.590 --> 00:00:38.930 
but you know it actually did have really
good<00:00:37.680> spells<00:00:37.950> in<00:00:38.129> the<00:00:38.160> game<00:00:38.250> but<00:00:38.520> I<00:00:38.579> think<00:00:38.670> the

00:00:38.930 --> 00:00:38.940 
good spells in the game but I think the

00:00:38.940 --> 00:00:40.190 
good spells in the game but I think the
goal<00:00:39.149> the<00:00:39.390> second<00:00:39.629> and<00:00:39.719> third<00:00:39.840> got<00:00:40.020> it<00:00:40.140> we

00:00:40.190 --> 00:00:40.200 
goal the second and third got it we

00:00:40.200 --> 00:00:41.840 
goal the second and third got it we
scored<00:00:40.440> we<00:00:40.590> scored<00:00:40.829> out<00:00:40.950> really<00:00:41.460> important

00:00:41.840 --> 00:00:41.850 
scored we scored out really important

00:00:41.850 --> 00:00:43.520 
scored we scored out really important
times<00:00:42.090> because<00:00:42.660> they<00:00:42.750> just<00:00:42.899> cannot<00:00:43.140> sucks<00:00:43.469> the

00:00:43.520 --> 00:00:43.530 
times because they just cannot sucks the

00:00:43.530 --> 00:00:44.569 
times because they just cannot sucks the
life<00:00:43.680> out<00:00:43.829> and<00:00:44.010> norwich<00:00:44.219> when<00:00:44.399> they're<00:00:44.489> having

00:00:44.569 --> 00:00:44.579 
life out and norwich when they're having

00:00:44.579 --> 00:00:46.100 
life out and norwich when they're having
a<00:00:44.670> really<00:00:44.879> good<00:00:45.059> spell<00:00:45.329> then<00:00:45.750> we're<00:00:45.870> going<00:00:46.079> to

00:00:46.100 --> 00:00:46.110 
a really good spell then we're going to

00:00:46.110 --> 00:00:47.779 
a really good spell then we're going to
do<00:00:46.230> that<00:00:46.469> so<00:00:46.770> they<00:00:47.129> kind<00:00:47.340> of<00:00:47.430> came<00:00:47.550> out<00:00:47.640> of

00:00:47.779 --> 00:00:47.789 
do that so they kind of came out of

00:00:47.789 --> 00:00:48.950 
do that so they kind of came out of
nowhere<00:00:47.940> but<00:00:48.360> i<00:00:48.420> think<00:00:48.660> that<00:00:48.750> was<00:00:48.840> really

00:00:48.950 --> 00:00:48.960 
nowhere but i think that was really

00:00:48.960 --> 00:00:50.569 
nowhere but i think that was really
important<00:00:49.440> today<00:00:49.530> because<00:00:49.829> the<00:00:50.280> game<00:00:50.430> did

00:00:50.569 --> 00:00:50.579 
important today because the game did

00:00:50.579 --> 00:00:52.250 
important today because the game did
everyone<00:00:50.820> flow<00:00:51.059> and<00:00:51.329> they<00:00:51.690> had<00:00:51.840> a<00:00:51.870> good<00:00:52.079> throw

00:00:52.250 --> 00:00:52.260 
everyone flow and they had a good throw

00:00:52.260 --> 00:00:54.020 
everyone flow and they had a good throw
in<00:00:52.440> this<00:00:52.590> this<00:00:52.949> year<00:00:53.129> more<00:00:53.370> than<00:00:53.430> kind<00:00:54.000> of

00:00:54.020 --> 00:00:54.030 
in this this year more than kind of

00:00:54.030 --> 00:00:55.880 
in this this year more than kind of
recent<00:00:54.360> seasons<00:00:54.780> other<00:00:55.350> teams<00:00:55.649> have<00:00:55.770> been

00:00:55.880 --> 00:00:55.890 
recent seasons other teams have been

00:00:55.890 --> 00:00:57.049 
recent seasons other teams have been
having<00:00:56.039> a<00:00:56.100> lot<00:00:56.160> of<00:00:56.250> possession<00:00:56.610> against<00:00:56.940> us

00:00:57.049 --> 00:00:57.059 
having a lot of possession against us

00:00:57.059 --> 00:00:58.790 
having a lot of possession against us
and<00:00:57.300> we<00:00:57.360> it<00:00:58.020> seems<00:00:58.230> like<00:00:58.350> we're<00:00:58.469> letting<00:00:58.680> them

00:00:58.790 --> 00:00:58.800 
and we it seems like we're letting them

00:00:58.800 --> 00:01:00.709 
and we it seems like we're letting them
do<00:00:58.949> it<00:00:58.980> but<00:00:59.280> somehow<00:00:59.670> it's<00:01:00.090> working<00:01:00.449> in<00:01:00.570> our

00:01:00.709 --> 00:01:00.719 
do it but somehow it's working in our

00:01:00.719 --> 00:01:02.090 
do it but somehow it's working in our
favor<00:01:00.750> I'm<00:01:01.199> not<00:01:01.379> sure<00:01:01.620> whether<00:01:01.890> it's

00:01:02.090 --> 00:01:02.100 
favor I'm not sure whether it's

00:01:02.100 --> 00:01:03.619 
favor I'm not sure whether it's
intentional<00:01:02.370> or<00:01:02.699> not<00:01:02.910> but<00:01:03.300> if<00:01:03.359> you<00:01:03.449> look<00:01:03.570> at

00:01:03.619 --> 00:01:03.629 
intentional or not but if you look at

00:01:03.629 --> 00:01:05.030 
intentional or not but if you look at
the<00:01:03.719> stats<00:01:03.930> as<00:01:04.140> well<00:01:04.170> we've<00:01:04.739> had<00:01:04.830> less

00:01:05.030 --> 00:01:05.040 
the stats as well we've had less

00:01:05.040 --> 00:01:07.820 
the stats as well we've had less
possession<00:01:05.489> of<00:01:05.610> in<00:01:06.390> each<00:01:06.510> game<00:01:06.750> this<00:01:07.020> year<00:01:07.290> but

00:01:07.820 --> 00:01:07.830 
possession of in each game this year but

00:01:07.830 --> 00:01:09.230 
possession of in each game this year but
somehow<00:01:08.159> it's<00:01:08.430> just<00:01:08.490> working<00:01:08.850> enough<00:01:09.030> favored

00:01:09.230 --> 00:01:09.240 
somehow it's just working enough favored

00:01:09.240 --> 00:01:10.250 
somehow it's just working enough favored
maybe<00:01:09.420> it's<00:01:09.600> we're<00:01:09.780> to<00:01:09.960> having<00:01:10.170> the

00:01:10.250 --> 00:01:10.260 
maybe it's we're to having the

00:01:10.260 --> 00:01:11.929 
maybe it's we're to having the
possession<00:01:10.680> or<00:01:10.740> something<00:01:11.100> I'm<00:01:11.250> not<00:01:11.430> sure<00:01:11.490> but

00:01:11.929 --> 00:01:11.939 
possession or something I'm not sure but

00:03:16.370 --> 00:03:16.380 
hard not to be confident these days but

00:03:16.380 --> 00:03:18.140 
hard not to be confident these days but
you<00:03:16.740> know<00:03:16.830> Jurgen<00:03:17.010> Klopp<00:03:17.340> is<00:03:17.459> not<00:03:17.580> gonna<00:03:17.730> be<00:03:17.910> on

the<00:03:18.270> touch<00:03:18.450> lines<00:03:18.690> that<00:03:18.930> he's<00:03:19.350> quite

00:03:19.550 --> 00:03:19.560 
the touch lines that he's quite

00:03:19.560 --> 00:03:20.930 
the touch lines that he's quite
influential<00:03:19.830> like<00:03:20.340> some<00:03:20.550> managers<00:03:20.850> it

00:03:20.930 --> 00:03:20.940 
influential like some managers it

00:03:20.940 --> 00:03:21.830 
influential like some managers it
doesn't<00:03:21.150> matter<00:03:21.270> but<00:03:21.450> he<00:03:21.540> is<00:03:21.660> quite

00:03:21.830 --> 00:03:21.840 
doesn't matter but he is quite

00:03:21.840 --> 00:03:23.480 
doesn't matter but he is quite
influential<00:03:22.200> so<00:03:22.500> hopefully<00:03:23.070> our<00:03:23.100> playing<00:03:23.340> to

00:03:23.480 --> 00:03:23.490 
influential so hopefully our playing to

00:03:23.490 --> 00:03:25.490 
influential so hopefully our playing to
our<00:03:23.520> hands<00:03:23.970> and<00:03:24.120> I<00:03:24.360> still<00:03:24.810> know<00:03:24.959> that<00:03:24.990> if<00:03:25.230> we<00:03:25.320> if

00:03:25.490 --> 00:03:25.500 
our hands and I still know that if we if

00:03:25.500 --> 00:03:27.050 
our hands and I still know that if we if
we<00:03:25.530> win<00:03:26.160> that<00:03:26.190> game<00:03:26.490> then<00:03:26.700> we're<00:03:26.790> in<00:03:26.850> a<00:03:26.910> really

00:03:27.050 --> 00:03:27.060 
we win that game then we're in a really

00:03:27.060 --> 00:03:27.860 
we win that game then we're in a really
pretty<00:03:27.240> strong<00:03:27.450> position

00:03:27.860 --> 00:03:27.870 
pretty strong position

00:03:27.870 --> 00:03:31.070 
pretty strong position
so<00:03:28.440> yeah<00:03:28.709> I'm<00:03:29.100> fairly<00:03:29.340> confident<00:03:29.700> I<00:03:29.850> think<00:03:30.150> you

00:03:31.070 --> 00:03:31.080 
so yeah I'm fairly confident I think you

00:03:31.080 --> 00:03:33.020 
so yeah I'm fairly confident I think you
know<00:03:31.230> a<00:03:31.470> draw<00:03:31.950> could<00:03:32.520> potentially<00:03:32.820> be<00:03:32.880> on<00:03:32.940> the

00:03:33.020 --> 00:03:33.030 
know a draw could potentially be on the

00:03:33.030 --> 00:03:34.610 
know a draw could potentially be on the
cards<00:03:33.270> but<00:03:33.360> I<00:03:33.390> I<00:03:33.510> want<00:03:33.990> a<00:03:34.050> victory<00:03:34.200> and<00:03:34.440> I<00:03:34.470> think

00:03:34.610 --> 00:03:34.620 
cards but I I want a victory and I think

00:03:34.620 --> 00:03:36.080 
cards but I I want a victory and I think
we<00:03:34.709> can<00:03:34.860> get<00:03:34.980> the<00:03:35.070> victory<00:03:35.340> I'd<00:03:35.640> be<00:03:35.940> very

00:03:36.080 --> 00:03:36.090

00:03:36.090 --> 00:03:38.300 
we can get the victory I'd be very
disappointed<00:03:36.209> if<00:03:36.570> we<00:03:36.660> lost<00:03:36.920> four<00:03:37.920> points<00:03:38.190> out

00:03:38.300 --> 00:03:38.310 
disappointed if we lost four points out

00:03:38.310 --> 00:03:39.380 
disappointed if we lost four points out
of<00:03:38.370> the<00:03:38.430> two<00:03:38.520> games<00:03:38.730> against<00:03:38.970> Dortmund<00:03:39.270> I'll
