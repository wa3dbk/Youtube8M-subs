so yeah I was having a hard time with
that<00:01:17.759> today<00:01:18.650> I<00:01:21.080> don't<00:01:22.080> know<00:01:22.229> if<00:01:22.320> you<00:01:22.409> guys

00:01:22.520 --> 00:01:22.530 
that today I don't know if you guys

00:01:22.530 --> 00:01:26.510

notice<00:01:23.040> that<00:01:23.189> when<00:01:23.310> I<00:01:23.340> talk<00:01:24.560> it's<00:01:25.560> like<00:01:25.770> I<00:01:26.070> get

00:01:26.510 --> 00:01:26.520 
notice that when I talk it's like I get

00:01:26.520 --> 00:01:31.520 
notice that when I talk it's like I get
shortness<00:01:27.000> of<00:01:27.150> breath<00:01:27.390> really<00:01:27.869> fast<00:01:28.140> I<00:01:30.530> think

00:01:31.520 --> 00:01:31.530 
shortness of breath really fast I think

00:01:31.530 --> 00:01:34.190 
shortness of breath really fast I think
it<00:01:31.590> has<00:01:31.740> a<00:01:31.770> lot<00:01:32.040> to<00:01:32.070> do<00:01:32.720> with<00:01:33.720> the<00:01:33.840> restraining

00:01:34.190 --> 00:01:34.200 
it has a lot to do with the restraining

00:01:34.200 --> 00:01:39.560 
it has a lot to do with the restraining
garment<00:01:35.630> it's<00:01:36.630> really<00:01:37.079> really<00:01:37.380> tight<00:01:37.970> and<00:01:38.970> I

00:01:39.560 --> 00:01:39.570 
garment it's really really tight and I

00:01:39.570 --> 00:01:41.300 
garment it's really really tight and I
understand<00:01:40.049> the<00:01:40.170> purpose<00:01:40.530> of<00:01:40.680> it<00:01:40.799> being<00:01:40.979> tight

00:01:41.300 --> 00:01:41.310 
understand the purpose of it being tight

00:01:41.310 --> 00:01:46.960 
understand the purpose of it being tight
but<00:01:42.409> it<00:01:43.409> makes<00:01:43.619> it<00:01:44.390> really<00:01:45.390> hard<00:01:45.630> to<00:01:45.810> talk<00:01:46.049> and

00:01:46.960 --> 00:01:46.970 
but it makes it really hard to talk and

00:01:46.970 --> 00:01:53.070 
but it makes it really hard to talk and
really<00:01:47.970> hard<00:01:48.270> to<00:01:48.390> breathe

00:01:53.070 --> 00:01:53.080
