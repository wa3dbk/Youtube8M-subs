00:00:00.980 --> 00:00:04.609
 hello that as they are this day I have 

00:00:03.379 --> 00:00:06.290
 prepared a tutorial that is going to 

00:00:04.609 --> 00:00:09.799
 help a lot in case they are 

00:00:06.290 --> 00:00:12.500
 photographers and designers usually 

00:00:09.799 --> 00:00:15.289
 touch be putting the pictures 

00:00:12.500 --> 00:00:18.019
 some type some text watermark 

00:00:15.289 --> 00:00:19.460
 or some kind of logo in the same way 

00:00:18.019 --> 00:00:21.589
 like this example that I am 

00:00:19.460 --> 00:00:24.080
 showing now that all 

00:00:21.589 --> 00:00:25.999
 photographs have the same logo that 

00:00:24.080 --> 00:00:29.779
 I will teach how to achieve it in a way 

00:00:25.999 --> 00:00:33.000
 easy and automated in a short time without 

00:00:29.779 --> 00:00:36.510
 so we started taking so long 

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:39.860
 we open out already open high and I'm going to 

00:00:36.510 --> 00:00:42.980
 speak a photograph that will serve me 

00:00:39.860 --> 00:00:46.150
 to be able to record the actions we are going to 

00:00:42.980 --> 00:00:46.150
 take actions 

00:00:47.320 --> 00:00:51.430
 so you can see in this part of 

00:00:49.930 --> 00:00:53.620
 nazaret here 

00:00:51.430 --> 00:00:55.750
 and with what 

00:00:53.620 --> 00:00:57.920
 of actions we are going to create a new 

00:00:55.750 --> 00:01:01.839
 binder 

00:00:57.920 --> 00:01:01.839
 we are going to call it actions 

00:01:02.180 --> 00:01:08.610
 today ok but the folder in case 

00:01:05.540 --> 00:01:12.080
 you have other wolves 

00:01:08.610 --> 00:01:14.420
 in different sizes of photographs 

00:01:12.080 --> 00:01:16.430
 etc 

00:01:14.420 --> 00:01:21.850
 we create the reaction already at that moment 

00:01:16.430 --> 00:01:21.850
 we are creating the action we click on 

00:01:23.030 --> 00:01:29.190
 we are going to name it action 

00:01:26.470 --> 00:01:33.050
 all 

00:01:29.190 --> 00:01:33.050
 you can add a color 

00:01:33.180 --> 00:01:37.740
 and also how temple can do something 

00:01:36.180 --> 00:01:40.340
 you can put it as the size of the 

00:01:37.740 --> 00:01:40.340
 Photography 

00:01:40.500 --> 00:01:47.340
 in case it is 500 by 507 etcetera 

00:01:44.250 --> 00:01:50.010
 because something that I want to leave very 

00:01:47.340 --> 00:01:52.200
 Of course, the photographs must 

00:01:50.010 --> 00:01:56.000
 have the same size can not be of 

00:01:52.200 --> 00:02:01.840
 another size so I already have 

00:01:56.000 --> 00:02:01.840
 the photograph and I want to add the logo 

00:02:05.680 --> 00:02:10.149
 I wish where I want a told him they have 

00:02:07.960 --> 00:02:12.370
 have the same size because if it is 

00:02:10.149 --> 00:02:13.690
 smaller or bigger will remain 

00:02:12.370 --> 00:02:15.490
 it's very big, it's going to be like 

00:02:13.690 --> 00:02:17.680
 and if very very small can be like 

00:02:15.490 --> 00:02:19.220
 out then they have to have the same 

00:02:17.680 --> 00:02:20.860
 size 

00:02:19.220 --> 00:02:23.440
 here now 

00:02:20.860 --> 00:02:26.700
 with what is fair today 

00:02:23.440 --> 00:02:28.530
 then where do I want it to be 

00:02:26.700 --> 00:02:32.440
 I come to 

00:02:28.530 --> 00:02:35.410
 file save as 

00:02:32.440 --> 00:02:38.830
 I'm going to save it in jpg because it's for 

00:02:35.410 --> 00:02:42.110
 that on the web and I will also create a 

00:02:38.830 --> 00:02:44.510
 new destination folder 

00:02:42.110 --> 00:02:48.220
 let's put that folder to youtube or 

00:02:44.510 --> 00:02:48.220
 photos with loud 

00:02:49.090 --> 00:02:54.510
 so we put 

00:02:51.970 --> 00:02:54.510
 fair 

00:02:55.010 --> 00:02:58.760
 I give him save 

00:02:56.930 --> 00:03:01.879
 I will also give you medical quality 

00:02:58.760 --> 00:03:04.910
 because how I want it for the game 

00:03:01.879 --> 00:03:07.480
 I want it light so 

00:03:04.910 --> 00:03:07.480
 key 

00:03:08.540 --> 00:03:12.890
 then I come something very important that does not 

00:03:10.670 --> 00:03:16.099
 I'm going to forget is to give stop in 

00:03:12.890 --> 00:03:18.349
 stop that if you will not keep recording like this 

00:03:16.099 --> 00:03:21.340
 that we already have the action that we want 

00:03:18.349 --> 00:03:21.340
 that is done 

00:03:22.350 --> 00:03:26.430
 in all the photographs of the we have 

00:03:24.210 --> 00:03:28.739
 so we come 

00:03:26.430 --> 00:03:32.130
 selection before you will be 

00:03:28.739 --> 00:03:35.430
 asking how I achieve 

00:03:32.130 --> 00:03:38.819
 in case I have 100 photographs and 

00:03:35.430 --> 00:03:42.109
 the photographs a thousand photographs 

00:03:38.819 --> 00:03:44.249
 as an achievement that all those photographs 

00:03:42.109 --> 00:03:50.540
 have the same logo on it 

00:03:44.249 --> 00:03:55.220
 position and its size without me silver 

00:03:50.540 --> 00:03:59.000
 how do we join file 

00:03:55.220 --> 00:04:00.260
 automate and lots 

00:03:59.000 --> 00:04:02.770
 so a new one will appear 

00:04:00.260 --> 00:04:04.570
 window 

00:04:02.770 --> 00:04:07.000
 set of actions what is the action 

00:04:04.570 --> 00:04:09.370
 that we create a set that is the letter of 

00:04:07.000 --> 00:04:12.490
 the action that is the specific action 

00:04:09.370 --> 00:04:14.380
 with the size that he had told them 

00:04:12.490 --> 00:04:17.170
 origin the folder where that photo is 

00:04:14.380 --> 00:04:19.860
 who are without the logo are also 

00:04:17.170 --> 00:04:19.860
 Photographs 

00:04:20.940 --> 00:04:26.760
 and here something very important in case 

00:04:23.850 --> 00:04:30.030
 you have subfolders in the folder 

00:04:26.760 --> 00:04:33.650
 main you are clicked you are selected 

00:04:30.030 --> 00:04:37.520
 in case it does not matter 

00:04:33.650 --> 00:04:39.979
 then we give him the destination where he will go 

00:04:37.520 --> 00:04:41.409
 are going to go all those photographs with the 

00:04:39.979 --> 00:04:43.809
 logo 

00:04:41.409 --> 00:04:46.149
 that if they remember we create a folder 

00:04:43.809 --> 00:04:47.769
 that was called photos with wolf equal in 

00:04:46.149 --> 00:04:49.749
 if they have not created it previously 

00:04:47.769 --> 00:04:51.249
 you are going to be able to stay here a new 

00:04:49.749 --> 00:04:53.529
 folder have the option to create a 

00:04:51.249 --> 00:04:56.830
 new folder over here I already had 

00:04:53.529 --> 00:04:59.289
 created a folder previously so 

00:04:56.830 --> 00:05:02.129
 I give him to choose I'll give him to ignore 

00:04:59.289 --> 00:05:05.139
 save commands like because if you remember 

00:05:02.129 --> 00:05:08.590
 we clicked 

00:05:05.139 --> 00:05:10.689
 sorry we keep coming up 

00:05:08.590 --> 00:05:13.139
 that step we keep the photographs 

00:05:10.689 --> 00:05:16.480
 then it is no longer necessary 

00:05:13.139 --> 00:05:19.529
 it will automatically save us 

00:05:16.480 --> 00:05:22.769
 so we give it ok 

00:05:19.529 --> 00:05:24.119
 and it's going to start working but I 

00:05:22.769 --> 00:05:26.249
 this moment I 'm not doing anything 

00:05:24.119 --> 00:05:29.249
 for putting soft is doing it all 

00:05:26.249 --> 00:05:30.959
 because he is placing the logo on the 

00:05:29.249 --> 00:05:34.139
 different photographs I have around 

00:05:30.959 --> 00:05:38.770
 of 20 photographs and he's doing it for 

00:05:34.139 --> 00:05:41.569
 me so it's a very useful tool 

00:05:38.770 --> 00:05:44.449
 especially if they have many photographs 

00:05:41.569 --> 00:05:47.689
 already ends 8-6 work for me 

00:05:44.449 --> 00:05:52.569
 I think it did not take more than 30 seconds 

00:05:47.689 --> 00:05:52.569
 or 10 seconds so let's review 

00:05:56.129 --> 00:06:01.880
 I look for photos with what the folder is 

00:05:58.889 --> 00:06:05.410
 where initially 

00:06:01.880 --> 00:06:09.260
 we had the folder that we had created 

00:06:05.410 --> 00:06:12.110
 as you can see here are the 

00:06:09.260 --> 00:06:15.490
 photographs with logo that's what happens 

00:06:12.110 --> 00:06:18.370
 If the photographs do not have 

00:06:15.490 --> 00:06:21.419
 the same size so that they see so that 

00:06:18.370 --> 00:06:21.419
 find what happens 

00:06:23.729 --> 00:06:30.880
 and all in the same size 

00:06:27.360 --> 00:06:33.250
 problem so I hope you find it useful 

00:06:30.880 --> 00:06:36.460
 this tutorial believe me you are going to 

00:06:33.250 --> 00:06:39.449
 save a lot of time so I hope 

00:06:36.460 --> 00:06:39.449
 that can 

00:06:40.330 --> 00:06:46.290
 and stores 

00:06:43.830 --> 00:06:48.330
 that is useful to you so thank you very much 

00:06:46.290 --> 00:06:50.760
