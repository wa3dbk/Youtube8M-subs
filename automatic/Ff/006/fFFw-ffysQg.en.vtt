00:02:18.910 --> 00:02:21.449 
between these two fingers right here ok
so<00:02:19.750> again<00:02:20.230> from<00:02:20.590> this<00:02:20.739> angle<00:02:20.920> you're<00:02:21.430> taking

00:02:21.449 --> 00:02:21.459 
so again from this angle you're taking

00:02:21.459 --> 00:02:25.830 
so again from this angle you're taking
it<00:02:22.060> but<00:02:22.870> actually<00:02:23.459> you<00:02:24.459> are<00:02:24.540> miss<00:02:25.540> angle

00:02:25.830 --> 00:02:25.840 
it but actually you are miss angle

00:02:25.840 --> 00:02:28.320 
it but actually you are miss angle
you're<00:02:25.989> just<00:02:26.170> dropping<00:02:26.860> it<00:02:27.220> gripping<00:02:28.180> it

00:02:28.320 --> 00:02:28.330 
you're just dropping it gripping it

00:02:28.330 --> 00:02:33.150 
you're just dropping it gripping it
pretending<00:02:29.320> it<00:02:29.470> took<00:02:29.890> it<00:02:30.040> and<00:02:31.830> once<00:02:32.830> you<00:02:33.010> got

00:02:33.150 --> 00:02:33.160 
pretending it took it and once you got

00:02:33.160 --> 00:02:34.860 
pretending it took it and once you got
that<00:02:33.190> down<00:02:33.670> you're<00:02:34.120> pretty<00:02:34.299> much<00:02:34.360> good<00:02:34.660> to<00:02:34.690> go

00:02:34.860 --> 00:02:34.870 
that down you're pretty much good to go

00:02:34.870 --> 00:02:36.000 
that down you're pretty much good to go
it's<00:02:35.200> going<00:02:35.350> to<00:02:35.380> take<00:02:35.440> a<00:02:35.560> little<00:02:35.739> bit<00:02:35.950> of

00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:36.010 
it's going to take a little bit of

00:02:36.010 --> 00:02:38.789 
it's going to take a little bit of
practice<00:02:36.519> and<00:02:36.900> actually<00:02:37.900> I<00:02:37.930> made<00:02:38.320> up<00:02:38.470> the<00:02:38.590> gun

00:02:38.789 --> 00:02:38.799 
practice and actually I made up the gun

00:02:38.799 --> 00:02:41.789 
practice and actually I made up the gun
part<00:02:39.100> so<00:02:39.670> you<00:02:40.600> can<00:02:40.750> basically<00:02:40.900> based<00:02:41.470> off<00:02:41.769> of

00:02:41.789 --> 00:02:41.799 
part so you can basically based off of

00:02:41.799 --> 00:02:43.740 
part so you can basically based off of
that<00:02:41.980> so<00:02:42.340> once<00:02:42.549> you<00:02:42.790> keep<00:02:43.150> on<00:02:43.269> going<00:02:43.480> like<00:02:43.540> this

00:02:43.740 --> 00:02:43.750 
that so once you keep on going like this

00:02:43.750 --> 00:02:46.800 
that so once you keep on going like this
and<00:02:43.930> once<00:02:44.290> you<00:02:44.440> do<00:02:44.590> your<00:02:44.769> French<00:02:45.040> drop<00:02:45.810> then

00:02:46.800 --> 00:02:46.810 
and once you do your French drop then

00:02:46.810 --> 00:02:48.090 
and once you do your French drop then
you<00:02:46.959> can<00:02:47.170> do<00:02:47.260> it<00:02:47.380> everyone<00:02:47.680> you<00:02:47.739> can<00:02:47.920> say<00:02:48.040> I'm

00:02:48.090 --> 00:02:48.100 
you can do it everyone you can say I'm

00:02:48.100 --> 00:02:50.610 
you can do it everyone you can say I'm
going<00:02:48.220> to<00:02:48.280> eat<00:02:48.340> the<00:02:48.459> coin<00:02:48.900> one<00:02:49.900> do<00:02:50.380> not

00:02:50.610 --> 00:02:50.620 
going to eat the coin one do not

00:02:50.620 --> 00:02:53.819 
going to eat the coin one do not
actually<00:02:50.950> eat<00:02:51.400> the<00:02:51.519> coin<00:02:52.170> the<00:02:53.170> way<00:02:53.350> how<00:02:53.470> you<00:02:53.530> do

00:02:53.819 --> 00:02:53.829 
actually eat the coin the way how you do

00:02:53.829 --> 00:02:57.630 
actually eat the coin the way how you do

00:02:57.630 --> 00:02:57.640 
this trick is you take the dollar you

00:02:57.640 --> 00:03:00.120 
this trick is you take the dollar you
rip<00:02:57.970> it<00:02:58.000> with<00:02:58.690> your<00:02:58.930> both<00:02:59.290> the<00:02:59.530> news<00:02:59.709> together

00:03:00.120 --> 00:03:00.130 
rip it with your both the news together

00:03:00.130 --> 00:03:03.449 
rip it with your both the news together
rip<00:03:01.030> it<00:03:01.209> but<00:03:01.870> don't<00:03:02.110> rip<00:03:02.320> it<00:03:02.440> forward<00:03:02.860> rip<00:03:03.340> it

00:03:03.449 --> 00:03:03.459 
rip it but don't rip it forward rip it

00:03:03.459 --> 00:03:08.030 
rip it but don't rip it forward rip it
backwards<00:03:04.530> now<00:03:05.730> take<00:03:06.730> the<00:03:07.120> folded<00:03:07.690> part

00:03:08.030 --> 00:03:08.040 
backwards now take the folded part

00:03:08.040 --> 00:03:10.259 
backwards now take the folded part
pretend<00:03:09.040> like<00:03:09.190> you're<00:03:09.340> grabbing<00:03:09.669> it<00:03:10.060> because

00:03:10.259 --> 00:03:10.269 
pretend like you're grabbing it because

00:03:10.269 --> 00:03:12.659 
pretend like you're grabbing it because
it's<00:03:10.450> ripped<00:03:10.720> and<00:03:10.989> put<00:03:11.829> it<00:03:11.919> in<00:03:12.040> your<00:03:12.070> mouth<00:03:12.370> or

00:03:12.659 --> 00:03:12.669 
it's ripped and put it in your mouth or

00:03:12.669 --> 00:03:14.210 
it's ripped and put it in your mouth or
put<00:03:13.030> it<00:03:13.120> in<00:03:13.150> your<00:03:13.269> pocket<00:03:13.450> somewhere

00:03:14.210 --> 00:03:14.220 
put it in your pocket somewhere

00:03:14.220 --> 00:03:17.270 
put it in your pocket somewhere
just<00:03:15.060> someone<00:03:15.330> really<00:03:15.630> can't<00:03:15.900> that<00:03:16.800> seems

00:03:17.270 --> 00:03:17.280 
just someone really can't that seems

00:03:17.280 --> 00:03:20.360 
just someone really can't that seems
it's<00:03:17.610> protected<00:03:18.390> so<00:03:19.320> when<00:03:19.530> you<00:03:19.830> open<00:03:19.860> the

00:03:20.360 --> 00:03:20.370 
it's protected so when you open the

00:03:20.370 --> 00:03:23.660 
it's protected so when you open the
dollar<00:03:21.020> it<00:03:22.020> will<00:03:22.200> automatically<00:03:22.770> become<00:03:23.280> a

00:03:23.660 --> 00:03:23.670 
dollar it will automatically become a

00:03:23.670 --> 00:03:27.110 
dollar it will automatically become a
real<00:03:23.940> dollar<00:03:24.210> and<00:03:24.740> the<00:03:25.740> reason<00:03:25.950> it's<00:03:26.730> still

00:03:27.110 --> 00:03:27.120 
real dollar and the reason it's still

00:03:27.120 --> 00:03:30.260 
real dollar and the reason it's still
there<00:03:27.980> but<00:03:28.980> it<00:03:29.130> looks<00:03:29.370> like<00:03:29.520> it<00:03:29.820> isn't<00:03:29.970> there

00:03:30.260 --> 00:03:30.270 
there but it looks like it isn't there

00:03:30.270 --> 00:03:32.570 
there but it looks like it isn't there
and<00:03:30.480> you<00:03:31.350> just<00:03:31.380> tuck<00:03:31.770> it<00:03:31.950> back<00:03:32.100> in<00:03:32.310> your<00:03:32.400> pocket

00:03:32.570 --> 00:03:32.580 
and you just tuck it back in your pocket

00:03:32.580 --> 00:03:37.280 
and you just tuck it back in your pocket
when<00:03:32.850> you're<00:03:33.030> done<00:03:35.360> do<00:03:36.360> not<00:03:36.540> actually<00:03:36.780> eat<00:03:37.140> the

00:03:37.280 --> 00:03:37.290 
when you're done do not actually eat the

00:03:37.290 --> 00:03:39.500
