00:00:59.370 --> 00:00:59.380 

00:00:59.380 --> 00:01:02.880 

what<00:01:00.010> I<00:01:00.040> did<00:01:00.370> is<00:01:00.580> I<00:01:01.360> got<00:01:01.630> they<00:01:02.260> already<00:01:02.620> made

00:01:02.880 --> 00:01:02.890 
what I did is I got they already made

00:01:02.890 --> 00:01:04.620 
what I did is I got they already made
things<00:01:03.160> on<00:01:03.310> petal<00:01:03.670> and<00:01:03.850> I<00:01:04.030> just<00:01:04.270> put<00:01:04.449> it<00:01:04.540> on

00:01:04.620 --> 00:01:04.630 
things on petal and I just put it on

00:01:04.630 --> 00:01:08.340 
things on petal and I just put it on
here<00:01:04.900> and<00:01:05.250> traced<00:01:06.250> it<00:01:06.660> you<00:01:07.660> can<00:01:07.870> go<00:01:07.960> online<00:01:08.170> and

00:01:08.340 --> 00:01:08.350 
here and traced it you can go online and

00:01:08.350 --> 00:01:10.680 
here and traced it you can go online and
find<00:01:08.680> plans<00:01:09.040> to<00:01:09.250> them<00:01:09.430> but<00:01:09.940> I<00:01:10.090> find<00:01:10.360> this<00:01:10.480> way

00:01:10.680 --> 00:01:10.690 
find plans to them but I find this way

00:01:10.690 --> 00:01:13.050 
find plans to them but I find this way
easier<00:01:11.340> so<00:01:12.340> now<00:01:12.550> that<00:01:12.610> you've<00:01:12.850> got<00:01:13.030> your

00:01:13.050 --> 00:01:13.060 
easier so now that you've got your

00:01:13.060 --> 00:01:15.270 
easier so now that you've got your
ping-pong<00:01:13.510> paddle<00:01:13.870> or<00:01:14.290> your<00:01:14.560> plans<00:01:14.830> going<00:01:15.100> on

00:01:15.270 --> 00:01:15.280

00:01:18.270 --> 00:01:18.280 
on your piece of wood go ahead and trace

00:01:18.280 --> 00:01:21.300 
on your piece of wood go ahead and trace
over<00:01:18.490> the<00:01:18.880> wood<00:01:19.330> onto<00:01:19.630> the<00:01:19.900> trace<00:01:20.860> the<00:01:21.010> paddle

00:01:21.300 --> 00:01:21.310

now<00:01:28.930> that<00:01:29.140> I've<00:01:29.260> traced<00:01:29.530> over<00:01:29.799> the<00:01:29.890> general

00:01:30.180 --> 00:01:30.190 
now that I've traced over the general

00:01:30.190 --> 00:01:31.859 
now that I've traced over the general

00:01:31.859 --> 00:01:31.869 
shape of the paddle I'm going to cut it

00:01:31.869 --> 00:01:33.450 
shape of the paddle I'm going to cut it
out<00:01:31.990> on<00:01:32.170> either<00:01:32.350> the<00:01:32.590> band<00:01:32.799> saw<00:01:33.040> or<00:01:33.070> the<00:01:33.280> jig

00:01:33.450 --> 00:01:33.460 
out on either the band saw or the jig

00:01:33.460 --> 00:01:33.840 
out on either the band saw or the jig

I'm<00:01:34.090> going<00:01:34.299> to<00:01:34.360> use<00:01:34.450> the<00:01:34.600> jig<00:01:34.780> saw<00:01:34.990> if<00:01:35.770> you're

00:01:36.060 --> 00:01:36.070 
I'm going to use the jig saw if you're

00:01:36.070 --> 00:01:37.920 
I'm going to use the jig saw if you're
using<00:01:36.310> a<00:01:36.490> jig<00:01:36.670> saw<00:01:36.700> this<00:01:37.240> is<00:01:37.420> where<00:01:37.570> the<00:01:37.690> use<00:01:37.780> of

using a jig saw this is where the use of

00:01:37.930 --> 00:01:40.260 
using a jig saw this is where the use of
a<00:01:37.990> clamp<00:01:38.259> comes<00:01:38.500> in<00:01:38.619> handy<00:01:39.060> you're<00:01:40.060> going<00:01:40.210> to

table works just once you have a very
tight<00:01:49.200> on<00:01:49.230> there<00:01:49.560> it<00:01:49.860> won't<00:01:50.070> move<00:01:50.220> a<00:01:50.280> lot<00:01:50.550> so

00:01:50.750 --> 00:01:50.760 
tight on there it won't move a lot so

00:01:50.760 --> 00:01:52.010 
tight on there it won't move a lot so
when<00:01:50.880> you<00:01:50.970> cut<00:01:51.120> it<00:01:51.210> out<00:01:51.360> it'll<00:01:51.570> be<00:01:51.720> a<00:01:51.750> pretty

00:01:52.010 --> 00:01:52.020 
when you cut it out it'll be a pretty

00:01:52.020 --> 00:01:55.640 
when you cut it out it'll be a pretty
even<00:01:52.410> cut<00:01:53.510> now<00:01:54.510> that<00:01:54.690> I've<00:01:54.780> got<00:01:54.960> my<00:01:55.080> workpiece

00:01:55.640 --> 00:01:55.650 
even cut now that I've got my workpiece

00:01:55.650 --> 00:01:57.980 
even cut now that I've got my workpiece
clamped<00:01:56.070> in<00:01:56.190> and<00:01:56.430> I've<00:01:56.850> got<00:01:57.000> my<00:01:57.120> jig<00:01:57.360> saw<00:01:57.540> time

00:01:57.980 --> 00:01:57.990 
clamped in and I've got my jig saw time

00:01:57.990 --> 00:02:15.309 
clamped in and I've got my jig saw time
to<00:01:58.110> cut<00:01:58.290> it<00:01:58.380> out

00:02:15.309 --> 00:02:15.319 

00:02:15.319 --> 00:02:17.780

00:02:17.780 --> 00:02:17.790 
now let you cut out your paddle you have

00:02:17.790 --> 00:02:19.069 
now let you cut out your paddle you have
a<00:02:17.819> pretty<00:02:18.120> rough<00:02:18.299> idea<00:02:18.629> of<00:02:18.689> what<00:02:18.840> it's<00:02:18.989> going

00:02:19.069 --> 00:02:19.079 
a pretty rough idea of what it's going

00:02:19.079 --> 00:02:20.449 
a pretty rough idea of what it's going
to<00:02:19.140> look<00:02:19.200> like<00:02:19.470> just<00:02:19.950> grab<00:02:20.129> some<00:02:20.310> rough

00:02:20.449 --> 00:02:20.459 
to look like just grab some rough

00:02:20.459 --> 00:02:23.539 
to look like just grab some rough
sandpaper<00:02:20.790> and<00:02:21.180> clean<00:02:21.420> up<00:02:21.480> those<00:02:21.599> edges<00:02:22.549> now

00:02:23.539 --> 00:02:23.549 
sandpaper and clean up those edges now

00:02:23.549 --> 00:02:25.009 
sandpaper and clean up those edges now
that<00:02:23.760> we've<00:02:23.939> made<00:02:24.090> the<00:02:24.239> paddle<00:02:24.569> part<00:02:24.750> it's

00:02:25.009 --> 00:02:25.019 
that we've made the paddle part it's
