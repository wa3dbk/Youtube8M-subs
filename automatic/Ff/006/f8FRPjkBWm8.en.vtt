00:04:02.000 --> 00:04:02.010 
take up your middle finger and you start

00:04:02.010 --> 00:04:03.980 
take up your middle finger and you start
off<00:04:02.100> on<00:04:02.130> the<00:04:02.370> fourth<00:04:02.670> fret<00:04:02.940> and<00:04:03.450> all<00:04:03.540> you<00:04:03.690> do<00:04:03.840> is

00:04:03.980 --> 00:04:03.990 
off on the fourth fret and all you do is

00:04:03.990 --> 00:04:35.820 
off on the fourth fret and all you do is
hit<00:04:04.560> the<00:04:04.710> strings<00:04:05.070> just

00:04:35.820 --> 00:04:35.830 

00:04:35.830 --> 00:04:38.170 

and<00:04:36.830> that<00:04:36.979> little<00:04:37.280> riff<00:04:37.490> right<00:04:37.729> there<00:04:38.000> is

00:04:38.170 --> 00:04:38.180 
and that little riff right there is

00:04:38.180 --> 00:04:40.029 
and that little riff right there is
probably<00:04:38.360> the<00:04:38.599> hardest<00:04:38.930> part<00:04:38.990> all<00:04:39.440> it<00:04:39.650> is<00:04:39.770> is

00:04:40.029 --> 00:04:40.039 
probably the hardest part all it is is

00:04:40.039 --> 00:04:43.839 
probably the hardest part all it is is
on<00:04:40.250> I<00:04:40.780> think<00:04:41.780> this<00:04:42.020> is<00:04:42.169> an<00:04:42.319> E<00:04:42.500> minor<00:04:42.770> all<00:04:43.520> you're

00:04:43.839 --> 00:04:43.849 
on I think this is an E minor all you're

00:04:43.849 --> 00:04:49.089 
on I think this is an E minor all you're
doing<00:04:44.090> is<00:04:44.240> 0<00:04:46.330> and<00:04:47.330> E<00:04:47.599> string<00:04:48.050> on<00:04:48.319> the<00:04:48.560> second

00:04:49.089 --> 00:04:49.099 
doing is 0 and E string on the second

00:04:49.099 --> 00:04:56.640 
doing is 0 and E string on the second
fret<00:04:49.129> you're<00:04:49.879> holding<00:04:50.300> those<00:04:50.419> two<00:04:50.690> down<00:04:55.389> then

00:05:00.770 --> 00:05:04.110 
your ring finger though this is how easy
you<00:05:00.979> can<00:05:01.099> use<00:05:01.129> whatever<00:05:01.400> fingers<00:05:01.909> you<00:05:02.060> want

00:05:04.110 --> 00:05:04.120
