00:00:01.429 --> 00:00:08.220
 sore all muscles all muscles hurt me 

00:00:05.100 --> 00:00:10.790
 comes sick says this topic of ours 

00:00:08.220 --> 00:00:13.349
 today's and big report 

00:00:10.790 --> 00:00:15.450
 I must say this very often I 

00:00:13.349 --> 00:00:17.910
 quite often and the clinical situation 

00:00:15.450 --> 00:00:20.130
 when a person comes and says i don't 

00:00:17.910 --> 00:00:22.380
 can walk and can't move and not 

00:00:20.130 --> 00:00:26.660
 I can become in the morning because I have 

00:00:22.380 --> 00:00:28.529
 understood all the muscles that logic 

00:00:26.660 --> 00:00:32.820
 diagnostic and therapeutic process 

00:00:28.529 --> 00:00:34.800
 begins with the main thing is inflammatory 

00:00:32.820 --> 00:00:37.829
 muscle disease or 

00:00:34.800 --> 00:00:41.280
 not an inflammatory disease of the muscles 

00:00:37.829 --> 00:00:42.930
 way you can install it 

00:00:41.280 --> 00:00:45.480
 inflammatory needs to be done today 

00:00:42.930 --> 00:00:48.690
 normal creatine phosphokinase kfc 

00:00:45.480 --> 00:00:51.390
 abbreviated if kfk increased means it 

00:00:48.690 --> 00:00:54.390
 muscle inflammation 

00:00:51.390 --> 00:00:55.699
 what is it all about ? 

00:00:54.390 --> 00:00:58.649
 first it can be the so-called 

00:00:55.699 --> 00:00:59.789
 systemic pathology of healing tissue 

00:00:58.649 --> 00:01:02.370
 dermatomyositis 

00:00:59.789 --> 00:01:05.540
 very serious and pathological 

00:01:02.370 --> 00:01:09.270
 disease the second situation is 

00:01:05.540 --> 00:01:11.369
 intoxication well, let's say intoxication 

00:01:09.270 --> 00:01:13.619
 with some chronic disease 

00:01:11.369 --> 00:01:14.630
 hence you need to identify the source 

00:01:13.619 --> 00:01:17.220
 inflammations 

00:01:14.630 --> 00:01:22.070
 The following clinical situation is this 

00:01:17.220 --> 00:01:25.680
 lure invasion there is such a disease 

00:01:22.070 --> 00:01:29.729
 trichinosis that affects my muscles 

00:01:25.680 --> 00:01:32.040
 life was such a period when 6 years on 

00:01:29.729 --> 00:01:34.369
 wave of enthusiasm worked infectious 

00:01:32.040 --> 00:01:36.420
 hospitals I learn a lot there 

00:01:34.369 --> 00:01:39.630
 particular i have seen a large number there 

00:01:36.420 --> 00:01:40.170
 Here are these patients with muscle diseases I 

00:01:39.630 --> 00:01:43.020
 remember 

00:01:40.170 --> 00:01:45.240
 just before my departure from the infectious 

00:01:43.020 --> 00:01:49.020
 the hospital was a patient with trichinosis 

00:01:45.240 --> 00:01:52.409
 from helminthic muscle invasion stole from neighbors 

00:01:49.020 --> 00:01:55.110
 from the yard and ate a dog from which 

00:01:52.409 --> 00:01:57.780
 infected with this trichinosis is not very 

00:01:55.110 --> 00:02:00.799
 she was glad that this dog 

00:01:57.780 --> 00:02:00.799
 dog ate 

00:02:00.840 --> 00:02:06.040
 the next infection situation is about 

00:02:03.370 --> 00:02:10.929
 which remembers all this chronic 

00:02:06.040 --> 00:02:13.270
 amazed you know dear people here 

00:02:10.929 --> 00:02:16.510
 everyone writes for chronic borreliosis 

00:02:13.270 --> 00:02:19.480
 sore muscles well yes I also know about it but 

00:02:16.510 --> 00:02:22.660
 somehow over 6 years of my work in 

00:02:19.480 --> 00:02:25.260
 Infectious Disease Hospital I have not seen such 

00:02:22.660 --> 00:02:28.510
 patients who could reliably 

00:02:25.260 --> 00:02:31.240
 put chronic borreliosis therefore 

00:02:28.510 --> 00:02:35.740
 this topic we put a little side and 

00:02:31.240 --> 00:02:38.140
 let's forget the following situation is new 

00:02:35.740 --> 00:02:40.590
 group disease is mitochondrial 

00:02:38.140 --> 00:02:42.640
 mitochondrial diseases are such 

00:02:40.590 --> 00:02:46.420
 intracellular formations will not 

00:02:42.640 --> 00:02:48.520
 explain look on the internet and here in 

00:02:46.420 --> 00:02:51.489
 a number of cases to these mitochondria 

00:02:48.520 --> 00:02:53.350
 formed antibodies that gives clinical 

00:02:51.489 --> 00:02:56.080
 effect in the form of a central lesion 

00:02:53.350 --> 00:02:58.660
 nervous system and muscle pain 

00:02:56.080 --> 00:03:01.780
 This is a very serious disease. 

00:02:58.660 --> 00:03:04.590
 if clinicians are watching us now i 

00:03:01.780 --> 00:03:07.660
 I want to give advice necessarily 

00:03:04.590 --> 00:03:09.850
 if you are forgiven for such patients doing 

00:03:07.660 --> 00:03:12.489
 cymatics lacquer mitochondria in large 

00:03:09.850 --> 00:03:14.860
 cities leading clinics and laboratories 

00:03:12.489 --> 00:03:17.320
 this is done if there is no possibility 

00:03:14.860 --> 00:03:19.209
 send blood to another city because 

00:03:17.320 --> 00:03:21.489
 it is very serious 

00:03:19.209 --> 00:03:23.799
 diagnosed diseases but with 

00:03:21.489 --> 00:03:26.830
 possibility to make this test 

00:03:23.799 --> 00:03:28.989
 stares quite easily treated one 

00:03:26.830 --> 00:03:32.350
 only afferent my 

00:03:28.989 --> 00:03:35.140
 let's say plasmapheresis such patients 

00:03:32.350 --> 00:03:37.959
 infrequent but I think with the development 

00:03:35.140 --> 00:03:41.459
 diagnostics they will be more and 

00:03:37.959 --> 00:03:43.810
 more come to light the following situation is 

00:03:41.459 --> 00:03:46.570
 chronic lung disease 

00:03:43.810 --> 00:03:49.450
 here are chronic lung diseases too 

00:03:46.570 --> 00:03:52.500
 give damage to muscles for example chronically 

00:03:49.450 --> 00:03:56.230
 tuberculosis, chronic bronchitis and asthma in 

00:03:52.500 --> 00:03:58.650
 they all have muscle pathology with 

00:03:56.230 --> 00:04:02.599
 which these muscles hurt and lose weight 

00:03:58.650 --> 00:04:06.360
 Trophy to find such a classic 

00:04:02.599 --> 00:04:10.829
 Subjects and sits peasant kolch such 

00:04:06.360 --> 00:04:13.470
 thin all like his whole life smokes 

00:04:10.829 --> 00:04:15.930
 thin all weak so small 

00:04:13.470 --> 00:04:19.979
 here it is a patient with muscle damage 

00:04:15.930 --> 00:04:22.250
 in chronic lung disease this 

00:04:19.979 --> 00:04:25.160
 muscle inflammation 

00:04:22.250 --> 00:04:28.289
 which you need to think first 

00:04:25.160 --> 00:04:30.350
 The following situation is not inflammatory. 

00:04:28.289 --> 00:04:33.389
 muscle damage 

00:04:30.350 --> 00:04:36.800
 which give pain here is necessary 

00:04:33.389 --> 00:04:40.770
 say with this is also a very big question 

00:04:36.800 --> 00:04:43.740
 people are very big sufferers everything hurts 

00:04:40.770 --> 00:04:46.250
 especially in the morning ah yes because of this pain 

00:04:43.740 --> 00:04:48.660
 can not become their developing 

00:04:46.250 --> 00:04:51.990
 concomitant depression for painful 

00:04:48.660 --> 00:04:54.660
 syndrome and you know the whole problem is 

00:04:51.990 --> 00:04:58.349
 that nothing is detected any 

00:04:54.660 --> 00:05:00.660
 changes will not dry muscle biopsy is not 

00:04:58.349 --> 00:05:02.430
 enzymes this so-called 

00:05:00.660 --> 00:05:07.400
 rheumatic polymyalgia 

00:05:02.430 --> 00:05:07.400
 most likely this disease is associated with 

00:05:07.580 --> 00:05:11.580
 pathology of the central nervous system with 

00:05:10.229 --> 00:05:14.159
 some kind of pathology 

00:05:11.580 --> 00:05:15.409
 with the defeat of the sensitive apparatus 

00:05:14.159 --> 00:05:18.479
 nervous system 

00:05:15.409 --> 00:05:21.720
 why I think so because it is treated 

00:05:18.479 --> 00:05:23.760
 she is this pathology this disease 

00:05:21.720 --> 00:05:27.539
 the banten and the drug 

00:05:23.760 --> 00:05:29.960
 central action which has 

00:05:27.539 --> 00:05:34.110
 braking function to conduct 

00:05:29.960 --> 00:05:36.870
 sensitive pain well this 

00:05:34.110 --> 00:05:38.780
 the end is the most common cause of muscle pain 

00:05:36.870 --> 00:05:41.340
 it's chronic fatigue syndrome 

00:05:38.780 --> 00:05:44.130
 which is associated that is called 

00:05:41.340 --> 00:05:45.090
 herpes infection even if she and 

00:05:44.130 --> 00:05:48.449
 no violation 

00:05:45.090 --> 00:05:51.240
 does not go out or manifested therefore 

00:05:48.449 --> 00:05:53.180
 year methodical understanding of what 

00:05:51.240 --> 00:05:55.620
 happens to be inflammatory and non-inflammatory 

00:05:53.180 --> 00:05:56.190
 damage to the muscles that give pain 

00:05:55.620 --> 00:05:58.940
 syndrome 

00:05:56.190 --> 00:06:01.530
 this is the right approach here meaning 

00:05:58.940 --> 00:06:03.990
 can be successfully diagnosed and treated 

00:06:01.530 --> 00:06:06.660
 that I am a male patient I wish 

00:06:03.990 --> 00:06:08.850
 and clinicians please on this topic 

00:06:06.660 --> 00:06:11.699
 ask any number of questions 

00:06:08.850 --> 00:06:13.910
 who interest you subscribe to

00:06:13.910 --> 00:06:19.229
 return to the topic 

00:06:15.660 --> 00:06:21.800
 pain syndromes waiting for your feedback and
