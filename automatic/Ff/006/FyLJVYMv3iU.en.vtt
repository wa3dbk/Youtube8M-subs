the<00:00:29.199> Middle<00:00:29.680> East<00:00:29.920> is<00:00:30.160> the<00:00:30.820> Fertile<00:00:31.420> Crescent

00:00:31.920 --> 00:00:31.930 
the Middle East is the Fertile Crescent

00:00:31.930 --> 00:00:36.150 
the Middle East is the Fertile Crescent
and<00:00:32.529> what<00:00:33.489> it<00:00:33.640> does<00:00:33.850> is<00:00:34.090> it<00:00:34.270> links<00:00:34.840> to<00:00:35.160> very

00:00:36.150 --> 00:00:36.160 
and what it does is it links to very

00:00:36.160 --> 00:00:40.020 
and what it does is it links to very
large<00:00:36.640> rivers<00:00:37.390> at<00:00:37.840> each<00:00:38.170> end<00:00:38.500> the<00:00:39.460> River<00:00:39.699> Nile

00:00:40.020 --> 00:00:40.030

00:00:51.570 --> 00:00:51.580 
Euphrates what used to be called

00:00:51.580 --> 00:00:55.829 
Euphrates what used to be called
Mesopotamia<00:00:52.650> which<00:00:53.650> means<00:00:54.030> the<00:00:55.030> middle<00:00:55.510> of

Mesopotamia which means the middle of
the<00:00:55.989> rivers<00:00:56.489> now<00:00:57.489> than<00:00:57.729> these<00:00:58.030> two<00:00:58.510> fertile

00:00:59.160 --> 00:00:59.170 
the rivers now than these two fertile

00:00:59.170 --> 00:01:02.789 
the rivers now than these two fertile
areas<00:01:00.159> were<00:01:00.729> the<00:01:00.790> centers<00:01:01.420> of<00:01:01.449> power<00:01:01.629> in<00:01:02.530> the

between<00:01:22.240> the<00:01:22.690> promised<00:01:23.170> land<00:01:23.700> now<00:01:24.700> you<00:01:24.760> notice

00:01:25.290 --> 00:01:25.300 
between the promised land now you notice

00:01:25.300 --> 00:01:27.750 
between the promised land now you notice
that<00:01:25.330> the<00:01:25.690> Arabian<00:01:26.260> desert<00:01:26.560> covers<00:01:27.370> all<00:01:27.610> of

00:01:39.540 --> 00:01:39.550 
travel through this narrow bit of land

00:01:39.550 --> 00:01:42.570 
travel through this narrow bit of land
here<00:01:40.120> all<00:01:40.780> the<00:01:41.140> traffic<00:01:41.590> was<00:01:41.770> directed<00:01:42.370> down

00:01:42.570 --> 00:01:42.580 
here all the traffic was directed down
