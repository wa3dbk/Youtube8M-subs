so<00:01:25.950> at<00:01:26.220> first<00:01:26.460> I<00:01:26.580> thought<00:01:26.759> this<00:01:26.939> was<00:01:27.180> to<00:01:28.110> tie<00:01:28.350> in

00:01:28.550 --> 00:01:28.560 
so at first I thought this was to tie in

00:01:28.560 --> 00:01:32.960 
so at first I thought this was to tie in
with<00:01:29.210> Easter<00:01:30.210> but<00:01:31.170> it's<00:01:31.500> actually<00:01:32.280> to<00:01:32.490> tie<00:01:32.729> in

00:01:32.960 --> 00:01:32.970 
with Easter but it's actually to tie in

00:01:32.970 --> 00:01:35.899 
with Easter but it's actually to tie in
I<00:01:33.650> guess<00:01:34.650> just<00:01:34.920> with<00:01:35.070> their<00:01:35.250> spring<00:01:35.700> line

00:01:35.899 --> 00:01:35.909 
I guess just with their spring line

00:01:35.909 --> 00:01:37.219 
I guess just with their spring line
because<00:01:36.270> they<00:01:36.390> do<00:01:36.450> have<00:01:36.630> a<00:01:36.689> couple<00:01:36.900> of<00:01:37.110> other

00:01:37.219 --> 00:01:37.229 
because they do have a couple of other

00:01:37.229 --> 00:01:39.740 
because they do have a couple of other
flavors<00:01:37.470> which<00:01:38.460> I<00:01:38.640> am<00:01:38.759> probably<00:01:39.180> gonna<00:01:39.570> go

00:01:39.740 --> 00:01:39.750 
flavors which I am probably gonna go

00:01:39.750 --> 00:01:41.390 
flavors which I am probably gonna go
back<00:01:39.780> and<00:01:40.079> pick<00:01:40.470> on<00:01:40.680> but<00:01:40.920> this<00:01:41.040> one<00:01:41.220> was<00:01:41.369> the

00:01:41.390 --> 00:01:41.400 
back and pick on but this one was the

00:01:41.400 --> 00:01:43.280 
back and pick on but this one was the
most<00:01:41.540> unique<00:01:42.540> one<00:01:42.689> because<00:01:42.930> it<00:01:43.020> was<00:01:43.079> actually

00:01:43.280 --> 00:01:43.290 
most unique one because it was actually

00:01:43.290 --> 00:01:45.469 
most unique one because it was actually
a<00:01:43.560> new<00:01:43.799> flavor<00:01:44.220> wasn't<00:01:44.670> just<00:01:44.820> a<00:01:44.909> new<00:01:45.030> color<00:01:45.299> or

00:01:45.469 --> 00:01:45.479 
a new flavor wasn't just a new color or

00:01:45.479 --> 00:01:46.940 
a new flavor wasn't just a new color or
anything<00:01:45.659> like<00:01:45.869> that<00:01:45.930> this<00:01:46.470> one<00:01:46.649> has<00:01:46.799> an

00:01:46.940 --> 00:01:46.950 
anything like that this one has an

00:01:46.950 --> 00:01:48.920 
anything like that this one has an
actual<00:01:47.340> different<00:01:47.759> flavor<00:01:47.970> to<00:01:48.060> it<00:01:48.299> I<00:01:48.420> love

many<00:04:07.630> chemicals<00:04:07.900> I<00:04:08.230> just<00:04:08.380> put<00:04:08.530> in<00:04:08.620> my<00:04:08.650> body

00:04:09.110 --> 00:04:09.120 
many chemicals I just put in my body

00:04:09.120 --> 00:04:13.500 
many chemicals I just put in my body
probably<00:04:10.120> way<00:04:10.269> too<00:04:10.330> many<00:04:11.640> I<00:04:12.640> just<00:04:13.360> hope<00:04:13.480> that

00:04:13.500 --> 00:04:13.510 
probably way too many I just hope that

00:04:13.510 --> 00:04:15.210 
probably way too many I just hope that
it<00:04:14.019> doesn't<00:04:14.290> change<00:04:14.350> my<00:04:14.620> poops<00:04:14.860> or<00:04:15.070> anything

00:04:15.210 --> 00:04:15.220 
it doesn't change my poops or anything

00:04:15.220 --> 00:04:17.300 
it doesn't change my poops or anything
like<00:04:15.400> that<00:04:15.489> because<00:04:15.970> that<00:04:16.000> would<00:04:16.269> be<00:04:16.359> bad<00:04:16.510> but

00:04:17.300 --> 00:04:17.310 
like that because that would be bad but

00:04:17.310 --> 00:04:20.000 
like that because that would be bad but
that<00:04:18.310> means<00:04:18.549> that<00:04:18.700> there<00:04:18.970> we<00:04:19.060> go<00:04:19.209> guys

00:04:20.000 --> 00:04:20.010 
that means that there we go guys

00:04:20.010 --> 00:04:21.690 
that means that there we go guys

00:04:21.690 --> 00:04:21.700 
and that is the

00:04:21.700 --> 00:04:25.500 
and that is the
M&amp;MS<00:04:22.150> spring<00:04:23.110> line<00:04:23.700> or<00:04:24.700> I<00:04:24.760> guess<00:04:24.970> the<00:04:25.000> spring

00:04:25.500 --> 00:04:25.510 
M&amp;MS spring line or I guess the spring

not one of those M&amp;Ms flavors that I

00:05:49.060 --> 00:05:50.880 
not one of those M&amp;Ms flavors that I
could<00:05:49.270> probably<00:05:49.450> have<00:05:49.660> a<00:05:49.690> lot<00:05:49.990> of<00:05:50.050> I'm

00:05:50.880 --> 00:05:50.890 
could probably have a lot of I'm

00:05:50.890 --> 00:05:53.730 
could probably have a lot of I'm
probably<00:05:51.310> like<00:05:51.730> 3<00:05:52.330> or<00:05:52.450> 4<00:05:52.510> or<00:05:52.810> 5<00:05:53.020> well<00:05:53.440> if<00:05:53.530> that's

00:05:53.730 --> 00:05:53.740 
probably like 3 or 4 or 5 well if that's

00:05:53.740 --> 00:05:56.280 
probably like 3 or 4 or 5 well if that's
too<00:05:53.920> little<00:05:54.070> I'm<00:05:54.370> just<00:05:54.970> lying<00:05:55.630> to<00:05:55.780> myself<00:05:55.930> now

00:05:56.280 --> 00:05:56.290 
too little I'm just lying to myself now

00:05:56.290 --> 00:05:58.530 
too little I'm just lying to myself now
I'm<00:05:56.620> trying<00:05:56.950> to<00:05:57.040> be<00:05:57.160> all<00:05:57.520> clever<00:05:58.030> about<00:05:58.210> not

00:05:58.530 --> 00:05:58.540 
I'm trying to be all clever about not

00:05:58.540 --> 00:06:01.590 
I'm trying to be all clever about not
eating<00:05:58.750> a<00:05:58.960> lot<00:05:59.140> I<00:05:59.760> mean<00:06:00.760> you<00:06:00.910> probably<00:06:01.120> eat<00:06:01.570> a

00:06:01.590 --> 00:06:01.600 
eating a lot I mean you probably eat a

00:06:01.600 --> 00:06:03.480 
eating a lot I mean you probably eat a
couple<00:06:01.900> of<00:06:02.050> handfuls<00:06:02.320> but<00:06:03.130> then<00:06:03.250> you<00:06:03.340> would

00:06:03.480 --> 00:06:03.490 
couple of handfuls but then you would

00:06:03.490 --> 00:06:05.190 
couple of handfuls but then you would
stop<00:06:03.730> like<00:06:03.940> there's<00:06:04.120> no<00:06:04.300> way<00:06:04.480> that<00:06:04.990> I<00:06:05.050> think

00:06:05.190 --> 00:06:05.200 
stop like there's no way that I think

00:06:05.200 --> 00:06:06.960 
stop like there's no way that I think
you<00:06:05.500> could<00:06:05.650> eat<00:06:05.740> like<00:06:05.980> half<00:06:06.010> a<00:06:06.310> bag<00:06:06.580> or<00:06:06.730> even<00:06:06.790> a

00:06:06.960 --> 00:06:06.970 
you could eat like half a bag or even a

00:06:06.970 --> 00:06:08.940 
you could eat like half a bag or even a
quarter<00:06:07.300> of<00:06:07.390> this<00:06:07.540> bag<00:06:07.780> just<00:06:08.080> because<00:06:08.830> the

00:06:08.940 --> 00:06:08.950 
quarter of this bag just because the

00:06:08.950 --> 00:06:11.340 
quarter of this bag just because the
flavor<00:06:09.220> is<00:06:09.460> very<00:06:09.760> strong<00:06:10.300> so<00:06:10.900> that<00:06:11.080> being<00:06:11.260> said

00:06:11.340 --> 00:06:11.350 
flavor is very strong so that being said

00:06:11.350 --> 00:06:13.650 
flavor is very strong so that being said
I<00:06:11.770> would<00:06:12.130> say<00:06:12.490> definitely<00:06:13.060> give<00:06:13.210> these<00:06:13.390> a<00:06:13.420> go

00:06:13.650 --> 00:06:13.660

00:06:13.660 --> 00:06:15.750 
I would say definitely give these a go
if<00:06:13.780> you<00:06:13.870> find<00:06:14.080> them<00:06:14.200> at<00:06:14.290> your<00:06:14.680> a<00:06:14.740> local<00:06:15.400> place
