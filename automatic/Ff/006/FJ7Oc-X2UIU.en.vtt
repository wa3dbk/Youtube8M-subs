out<00:00:31.610> and<00:00:32.610> it's<00:00:32.880> for<00:00:33.180> our<00:00:33.739> first<00:00:34.739> real<00:00:35.309> big

00:00:36.280 --> 00:00:36.290 
out and it's for our first real big

00:00:36.290 --> 00:00:39.860 
out and it's for our first real big
biology<00:00:37.290> test<00:00:37.620> that<00:00:38.250> we're<00:00:38.430> having<00:00:38.610> in<00:00:39.030> the

00:00:39.860 --> 00:00:39.870 
biology test that we're having in the

00:00:39.870 --> 00:00:42.619 
biology test that we're having in the
second<00:00:40.200> semester<00:00:40.379> so<00:00:41.370> we<00:00:42.120> all<00:00:42.270> know<00:00:42.450> that's

00:00:42.619 --> 00:00:42.629 
second semester so we all know that's

00:00:42.629 --> 00:00:45.170 
second semester so we all know that's
fun<00:00:43.050> and<00:00:43.440> what's<00:00:44.129> better<00:00:44.460> than<00:00:44.700> the<00:00:44.910> test

00:00:45.170 --> 00:00:45.180 
fun and what's better than the test

00:00:45.180 --> 00:00:47.470 
fun and what's better than the test
objectives<00:00:45.840> and<00:00:46.079> I<00:00:46.140> was<00:00:46.350> looking<00:00:46.710> through<00:00:46.739> and

00:00:47.470 --> 00:00:47.480 
objectives and I was looking through and

00:00:47.480 --> 00:00:50.150 
objectives and I was looking through and
the<00:00:48.480> first<00:00:48.629> one<00:00:48.899> kind<00:00:49.020> of<00:00:49.170> surprised<00:00:49.649> me<00:00:49.950> and

00:00:50.150 --> 00:00:50.160 
the first one kind of surprised me and

00:00:50.160 --> 00:00:52.430 
the first one kind of surprised me and
I'm<00:00:50.309> gonna<00:00:50.640> go<00:00:50.789> over<00:00:51.149> it<00:00:51.300> because<00:00:51.660> I<00:00:51.690> know<00:00:52.230> I

00:00:52.430 --> 00:00:52.440 
I'm gonna go over it because I know I

00:00:52.440 --> 00:00:56.319 
I'm gonna go over it because I know I
had<00:00:52.860> to<00:00:52.890> look<00:00:53.219> back<00:00:53.550> and<00:00:53.930> I<00:00:54.930> thought<00:00:55.379> it<00:00:55.530> was

00:00:56.319 --> 00:00:56.329 
had to look back and I thought it was

00:00:56.329 --> 00:00:58.700 
had to look back and I thought it was
pretty<00:00:57.329> interesting<00:00:57.989> that<00:00:58.140> we<00:00:58.230> were<00:00:58.379> going<00:00:58.559> to

00:00:58.700 --> 00:00:58.710 
pretty interesting that we were going to

00:00:58.710 --> 00:01:03.880 
pretty interesting that we were going to
go<00:00:59.430> back<00:00:59.609> over<00:00:59.969> it<00:01:00.000> again<00:01:00.149> but<00:01:00.719> hey<00:01:01.129> why<00:01:02.129> not<00:01:02.449> so

00:01:03.880 --> 00:01:03.890 
go back over it again but hey why not so

00:01:03.890 --> 00:01:06.980 
go back over it again but hey why not so
if<00:01:04.890> you<00:01:05.070> take<00:01:05.280> a<00:01:05.309> look<00:01:05.489> for<00:01:05.549> yourself<00:01:05.990> we're

00:01:06.980 --> 00:01:06.990 
if you take a look for yourself we're

00:01:06.990 --> 00:01:08.810 
if you take a look for yourself we're
going<00:01:07.260> to<00:01:07.350> be<00:01:07.470> asked<00:01:07.920> did<00:01:08.159> the<00:01:08.280> difference

00:01:08.810 --> 00:01:08.820 
going to be asked did the difference

00:01:08.820 --> 00:01:12.380 
going to be asked did the difference
between<00:01:09.380> prokaryotic<00:01:10.380> and<00:01:10.860> eukaryotic<00:01:11.390> cells

00:01:12.380 --> 00:01:12.390 
between prokaryotic and eukaryotic cells

00:01:12.390 --> 00:01:15.230 
between prokaryotic and eukaryotic cells
so<00:01:13.320> if<00:01:13.799> I<00:01:13.950> can<00:01:14.159> figure<00:01:14.369> out<00:01:14.520> how<00:01:14.640> to<00:01:14.670> spell

00:01:15.230 --> 00:01:15.240 
so if I can figure out how to spell

00:01:15.240 --> 00:01:21.160 
so if I can figure out how to spell
these<00:01:15.450> we<00:01:16.290> have<00:01:17.630> prokaryotic<00:01:18.770> and<00:01:19.770> we<00:01:20.729> have

00:01:21.160 --> 00:01:21.170 
these we have prokaryotic and we have

00:01:21.170 --> 00:01:25.429 
these we have prokaryotic and we have
you<00:01:22.170> carry<00:01:23.119> otic<00:01:24.119> and<00:01:24.360> my<00:01:24.750> terrible

00:01:25.429 --> 00:01:25.439 
you carry otic and my terrible

00:01:25.439 --> 00:01:28.580 
you carry otic and my terrible
handwriting<00:01:25.880> so<00:01:26.880> prokaryotic<00:01:27.750> cells<00:01:28.290> are

00:01:28.580 --> 00:01:28.590 
handwriting so prokaryotic cells are

00:01:28.590 --> 00:01:37.990 
handwriting so prokaryotic cells are
cells<00:01:29.579> that<00:01:29.909> lack<00:01:30.420> a<00:01:31.790> nuclear<00:01:34.490> membrane<00:01:35.490> and

00:01:37.990 --> 00:01:38.000 
cells that lack a nuclear membrane and

00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:40.940 
cells that lack a nuclear membrane and
contrary<00:01:39.000> to<00:01:39.180> popular<00:01:39.360> belief<00:01:39.990> this<00:01:40.560> is<00:01:40.710> not

00:01:40.940 --> 00:01:40.950 
contrary to popular belief this is not

00:01:40.950 --> 00:01:44.600 
contrary to popular belief this is not
talking<00:01:41.430> about<00:01:41.520> a<00:01:41.700> bomb<00:01:42.090> but<00:01:42.689> about<00:01:43.110> the<00:01:43.610> the

00:01:44.600 --> 00:01:44.610 
talking about a bomb but about the the

00:01:44.610 --> 00:01:48.620 
talking about a bomb but about the the
brain<00:01:44.939> basically<00:01:45.810> of<00:01:46.140> a<00:01:46.500> cell<00:01:46.740> and<00:01:47.630> eukaryotic

00:01:48.620 --> 00:01:48.630 
brain basically of a cell and eukaryotic

00:01:48.630 --> 00:01:54.880 
brain basically of a cell and eukaryotic
cells<00:01:49.140> do<00:01:50.090> have<00:01:51.090> a<00:01:52.220> nuclear<00:01:53.220> membrane<00:01:53.549> and

00:01:54.880 --> 00:01:54.890 
cells do have a nuclear membrane and

00:01:54.890 --> 00:01:59.389 
cells do have a nuclear membrane and
that's<00:01:55.890> the<00:01:56.100> really<00:01:56.460> big<00:01:57.770> that's<00:01:58.770> the<00:01:59.070> really

00:01:59.389 --> 00:01:59.399 
that's the really big that's the really

00:01:59.399 --> 00:02:01.880 
that's the really big that's the really
big<00:01:59.430> difference<00:01:59.670> I<00:02:00.420> believe<00:02:00.930> prokaryotic

00:02:01.880 --> 00:02:01.890 
big difference I believe prokaryotic

00:02:01.890 --> 00:02:06.380 
big difference I believe prokaryotic
cells<00:02:02.280> do<00:02:02.640> not<00:02:02.670> have<00:02:04.250> encased<00:02:05.250> organelles<00:02:06.030> and

00:02:06.380 --> 00:02:06.390 
cells do not have encased organelles and

00:02:06.390 --> 00:02:10.040 
cells do not have encased organelles and
they<00:02:06.479> only<00:02:06.659> have<00:02:06.990> distinct<00:02:07.819> organelles<00:02:09.050> and

00:02:10.040 --> 00:02:10.050 
they only have distinct organelles and

00:02:10.050 --> 00:02:13.780 
they only have distinct organelles and
eukaryotic<00:02:11.039> cells<00:02:11.310> do<00:02:11.670> have<00:02:11.910> distinct<00:02:12.750> organ

00:02:13.780 --> 00:02:13.790 
eukaryotic cells do have distinct organ

00:02:13.790 --> 00:02:17.140 
eukaryotic cells do have distinct organ
do<00:02:14.569> have<00:02:14.840> other<00:02:15.260> organelles<00:02:15.769> but<00:02:16.150> the

00:02:17.140 --> 00:02:17.150 
do have other organelles but the

00:02:17.150 --> 00:02:18.910 
do have other organelles but the
membranes<00:02:17.629> the<00:02:17.900> big<00:02:18.049> difference<00:02:18.530> you<00:02:18.739> can

00:02:18.910 --> 00:02:18.920 
membranes the big difference you can

00:02:18.920 --> 00:02:20.800 
membranes the big difference you can
take<00:02:19.099> a<00:02:19.129> look<00:02:19.340> at<00:02:19.519> all<00:02:19.640> the<00:02:19.670> different<00:02:20.269> subs

00:02:20.800 --> 00:02:20.810 
take a look at all the different subs

00:02:20.810 --> 00:02:25.210 
take a look at all the different subs
sub<00:02:21.739> stuff<00:02:22.099> yourself<00:02:22.610> so<00:02:23.450> uh<00:02:23.480> if<00:02:23.989> you<00:02:24.530> really

00:02:25.210 --> 00:02:25.220 
sub stuff yourself so uh if you really

00:02:25.220 --> 00:02:27.880 
sub stuff yourself so uh if you really
want<00:02:25.430> to<00:02:25.549> remember<00:02:25.700> what<00:02:26.299> a<00:02:26.360> membrane<00:02:26.930> is<00:02:27.260> what

00:02:27.880 --> 00:02:27.890 
want to remember what a membrane is what

00:02:27.890 --> 00:02:30.339 
want to remember what a membrane is what
a<00:02:27.920> nuclear<00:02:28.340> membrane<00:02:28.579> is<00:02:28.970> you<00:02:29.689> basically<00:02:29.900> have

00:02:30.339 --> 00:02:30.349 
a nuclear membrane is you basically have

00:02:30.349 --> 00:02:33.640 
a nuclear membrane is you basically have
a<00:02:30.379> big<00:02:30.920> so<00:02:31.730> right<00:02:32.209> and<00:02:32.810> within<00:02:33.049> that<00:02:33.319> cell

00:02:33.640 --> 00:02:33.650

itself<00:02:57.909> we<00:02:58.909> all<00:02:59.060> remember<00:02:59.510> what<00:02:59.720> fun<00:03:00.049> mitosis

00:03:00.729 --> 00:03:00.739 
itself we all remember what fun mitosis

00:03:00.739 --> 00:03:03.910 
itself we all remember what fun mitosis
was<00:03:00.950> but<00:03:01.909> eukaryotic<00:03:02.659> cells<00:03:02.930> eukaryotic

00:03:03.910 --> 00:03:03.920 
was but eukaryotic cells eukaryotic

00:03:03.920 --> 00:03:06.879 
was but eukaryotic cells eukaryotic
cells<00:03:04.159> do<00:03:04.639> have<00:03:05.060> a<00:03:05.090> membrane<00:03:05.629> around<00:03:06.079> them<00:03:06.349> so

00:03:06.879 --> 00:03:06.889 
cells do have a membrane around them so

00:03:06.889 --> 00:03:09.819 
cells do have a membrane around them so
the<00:03:07.190> DNA<00:03:07.609> is<00:03:07.760> going<00:03:07.970> to<00:03:08.239> be<00:03:08.389> encased<00:03:08.989> and<00:03:09.319> that

00:03:09.819 --> 00:03:09.829 
the DNA is going to be encased and that

00:03:09.829 --> 00:03:14.020 
the DNA is going to be encased and that
is<00:03:10.159> the<00:03:10.489> big<00:03:10.730> difference<00:03:11.620> we<00:03:12.620> are<00:03:12.650> also<00:03:13.040> asked

00:03:14.020 --> 00:03:14.030 
is the big difference we are also asked

00:03:14.030 --> 00:03:19.030 
is the big difference we are also asked
about<00:03:14.349> shapes<00:03:15.349> of<00:03:15.760> bacteria<00:03:16.760> and<00:03:18.040> structure

00:03:19.030 --> 00:03:19.040 
about shapes of bacteria and structure

00:03:19.040 --> 00:03:21.759 
about shapes of bacteria and structure
of<00:03:19.220> bacteria<00:03:20.090> I'm<00:03:20.480> gonna<00:03:20.780> do<00:03:20.930> structure<00:03:21.560> in<00:03:21.680> a

00:03:21.759 --> 00:03:21.769 
of bacteria I'm gonna do structure in a

00:03:21.769 --> 00:03:23.319 
of bacteria I'm gonna do structure in a
different<00:03:22.129> video<00:03:22.250> because<00:03:22.760> that<00:03:22.970> could<00:03:23.090> get

00:03:23.319 --> 00:03:23.329 
different video because that could get

00:03:23.329 --> 00:03:26.500 
different video because that could get
kind<00:03:23.569> of<00:03:23.750> long<00:03:24.400> but<00:03:25.400> I<00:03:25.430> will<00:03:25.699> go<00:03:25.849> into<00:03:26.060> shapes

00:03:26.500 --> 00:03:26.510 
kind of long but I will go into shapes

00:03:26.510 --> 00:03:30.009 
kind of long but I will go into shapes
and<00:03:26.840> types<00:03:27.579> so<00:03:28.579> if<00:03:28.849> you<00:03:28.970> take<00:03:29.209> a<00:03:29.239> look<00:03:29.540> at<00:03:29.780> the

00:03:30.009 --> 00:03:30.019 
and types so if you take a look at the

00:03:30.019 --> 00:03:32.650 
and types so if you take a look at the
screen<00:03:30.410> you're<00:03:30.739> going<00:03:30.889> to<00:03:31.010> see<00:03:31.340> two<00:03:31.669> very<00:03:32.299> cool

00:03:32.650 --> 00:03:32.660 
screen you're going to see two very cool

00:03:32.660 --> 00:03:36.819 
screen you're going to see two very cool
images<00:03:33.260> and<00:03:34.329> the<00:03:35.329> first<00:03:35.629> one<00:03:35.900> on<00:03:36.169> the<00:03:36.349> left<00:03:36.590> the

00:03:36.819 --> 00:03:36.829 
images and the first one on the left the

00:03:36.829 --> 00:03:40.500 
images and the first one on the left the
one<00:03:36.919> with<00:03:37.310> the<00:03:37.459> pink<00:03:37.900> is<00:03:39.069> representing<00:03:40.069> some

00:03:40.500 --> 00:03:40.510 
one with the pink is representing some

00:03:40.510 --> 00:03:43.930 
one with the pink is representing some
bacillus<00:03:41.510> Bacchus<00:03:42.410> however<00:03:43.310> you<00:03:43.459> want<00:03:43.639> to<00:03:43.699> say

00:03:43.930 --> 00:03:43.940 
bacillus Bacchus however you want to say

00:03:43.940 --> 00:03:47.530 
bacillus Bacchus however you want to say
it<00:03:44.109> and<00:03:45.109> it's<00:03:45.379> rod<00:03:45.769> shaped<00:03:46.250> so<00:03:46.849> basically<00:03:47.239> what

00:03:47.530 --> 00:03:47.540 
it and it's rod shaped so basically what

00:03:47.540 --> 00:03:50.680 
it and it's rod shaped so basically what
you're<00:03:47.660> going<00:03:47.870> to<00:03:48.049> have<00:03:48.260> is<00:03:49.389> basically<00:03:50.389> some

00:03:50.680 --> 00:03:50.690 
you're going to have is basically some

00:03:50.690 --> 00:03:55.030 
you're going to have is basically some
cylinder<00:03:51.500> shaped<00:03:53.169> bacteria<00:03:54.169> they're<00:03:54.829> going

00:03:55.030 --> 00:03:55.040 
cylinder shaped bacteria they're going

00:03:55.040 --> 00:03:59.369 
cylinder shaped bacteria they're going
to<00:03:55.160> be<00:03:55.280> fairly<00:03:55.730> long<00:03:56.180> and<00:03:56.829> it's<00:03:57.829> going<00:03:58.099> to<00:03:58.220> be

00:03:59.369 --> 00:03:59.379 
to be fairly long and it's going to be

00:03:59.379 --> 00:04:01.960 
to be fairly long and it's going to be
it's<00:04:00.379> not<00:04:00.470> going<00:04:00.590> to<00:04:00.859> be<00:04:00.949> circular<00:04:01.459> it's<00:04:01.699> going

00:04:01.960 --> 00:04:01.970 
it's not going to be circular it's going

00:04:01.970 --> 00:04:05.500 
it's not going to be circular it's going
to<00:04:02.060> be<00:04:02.180> kind<00:04:02.569> of<00:04:02.690> extended<00:04:03.819> the<00:04:04.819> caucus

00:04:05.500 --> 00:04:05.510 
to be kind of extended the caucus

00:04:05.510 --> 00:04:08.500 
to be kind of extended the caucus
bacteria<00:04:06.260> are<00:04:06.699> spherical<00:04:07.699> shaped<00:04:08.120> and<00:04:08.329> if<00:04:08.419> you

00:04:08.500 --> 00:04:08.510 
bacteria are spherical shaped and if you

00:04:08.510 --> 00:04:10.979 
bacteria are spherical shaped and if you
look<00:04:08.720> at<00:04:08.810> the<00:04:08.930> right<00:04:09.139> you<00:04:09.169> have<00:04:09.379> these<00:04:10.250> smaller

00:04:10.979 --> 00:04:10.989 
look at the right you have these smaller

00:04:10.989 --> 00:04:14.140 
look at the right you have these smaller
spheres<00:04:11.989> this<00:04:12.590> is<00:04:12.739> obviously<00:04:13.310> a<00:04:13.430> colony<00:04:14.120> of

00:04:14.140 --> 00:04:14.150 
spheres this is obviously a colony of

00:04:14.150 --> 00:04:18.310 
spheres this is obviously a colony of
coccus<00:04:15.250> bacteria<00:04:16.250> and<00:04:16.549> what<00:04:17.419> a<00:04:17.479> colony<00:04:17.930> is<00:04:18.049> is

00:04:18.310 --> 00:04:18.320 
coccus bacteria and what a colony is is

00:04:18.320 --> 00:04:20.529 
coccus bacteria and what a colony is is
basically<00:04:18.530> just<00:04:19.370> this<00:04:19.609> it's<00:04:19.909> a<00:04:20.030> group<00:04:20.359> of

00:04:20.529 --> 00:04:20.539 
basically just this it's a group of

00:04:20.539 --> 00:04:23.589 
basically just this it's a group of
bacteria<00:04:20.750> a<00:04:21.470> large<00:04:22.400> group<00:04:22.760> you<00:04:23.060> can't<00:04:23.300> just<00:04:23.510> be

00:04:23.589 --> 00:04:23.599 
bacteria a large group you can't just be

00:04:23.599 --> 00:04:27.730 
bacteria a large group you can't just be
like<00:04:23.950> one<00:04:24.950> or<00:04:25.639> two<00:04:25.669> has<00:04:26.419> to<00:04:26.599> be<00:04:26.690> a<00:04:26.719> large

00:04:27.730 --> 00:04:27.740 
like one or two has to be a large

00:04:27.740 --> 00:04:32.710 
like one or two has to be a large
group<00:04:29.229> the<00:04:30.229> next<00:04:30.560> picture<00:04:31.009> the<00:04:31.370> bottom<00:04:32.330> or

00:04:32.710 --> 00:04:32.720 
group the next picture the bottom or

00:04:32.720 --> 00:04:37.809 
group the next picture the bottom or
this<00:04:33.410> one<00:04:33.680> the<00:04:34.520> top<00:04:34.759> left<00:04:35.180> one<00:04:35.479> our<00:04:36.819> spiral

00:04:37.809 --> 00:04:37.819 
this one the top left one our spiral

00:04:37.819 --> 00:04:39.610 
this one the top left one our spiral
them<00:04:37.970> and<00:04:38.210> you<00:04:38.569> can<00:04:38.750> tell<00:04:38.960> because<00:04:39.169> they<00:04:39.440> look

00:04:39.610 --> 00:04:39.620 
them and you can tell because they look

00:04:39.620 --> 00:04:43.469 
them and you can tell because they look
like<00:04:39.770> a<00:04:39.830> spiral<00:04:40.370> now<00:04:41.240> they're<00:04:42.229> fairly<00:04:42.680> short

00:04:43.469 --> 00:04:43.479 
like a spiral now they're fairly short

00:04:43.479 --> 00:04:46.839 
like a spiral now they're fairly short
compared<00:04:44.479> to<00:04:44.780> your<00:04:44.990> spirochete<00:04:45.800> a<00:04:46.069> spirochete

00:04:46.839 --> 00:04:46.849 
compared to your spirochete a spirochete

00:04:46.849 --> 00:04:50.260 
compared to your spirochete a spirochete
is<00:04:47.330> a<00:04:47.569> really<00:04:48.110> long<00:04:48.349> spiral<00:04:48.860> um<00:04:49.280> I<00:04:49.580> hope<00:04:50.030> that

00:04:50.260 --> 00:04:50.270 
is a really long spiral um I hope that

00:04:50.270 --> 00:04:54.339 
is a really long spiral um I hope that
helps<00:04:50.660> so<00:04:51.470> now<00:04:51.680> we<00:04:51.740> have<00:04:51.979> a<00:04:52.539> vibe<00:04:53.539> Rio<00:04:53.900> and

00:04:54.339 --> 00:04:54.349 
helps so now we have a vibe Rio and

00:04:54.349 --> 00:04:58.360 
helps so now we have a vibe Rio and
that's<00:04:54.800> basically<00:04:55.250> a<00:04:55.400> curved<00:04:56.330> or<00:04:57.250> basically<00:04:58.250> a

00:04:58.360 --> 00:04:58.370 
that's basically a curved or basically a

00:04:58.370 --> 00:05:01.749 
that's basically a curved or basically a
boomerang<00:04:59.060> shaped<00:05:00.069> you<00:05:01.069> can<00:05:01.250> see<00:05:01.430> here<00:05:01.669> it

00:05:01.749 --> 00:05:01.759 
boomerang shaped you can see here it

00:05:01.759 --> 00:05:04.390 
boomerang shaped you can see here it
shapes<00:05:02.030> kind<00:05:02.479> of<00:05:02.569> like<00:05:02.659> a<00:05:02.690> boomerang<00:05:03.440> so

00:05:04.390 --> 00:05:04.400 
shapes kind of like a boomerang so

00:05:04.400 --> 00:05:07.689 
shapes kind of like a boomerang so
that's<00:05:04.580> a<00:05:04.699> vibe<00:05:04.909> Rio<00:05:05.259> here<00:05:06.259> you<00:05:06.409> have<00:05:06.680> a<00:05:06.710> some

00:05:07.689 --> 00:05:07.699 
that's a vibe Rio here you have a some

00:05:07.699 --> 00:05:10.210 
that's a vibe Rio here you have a some
Square<00:05:08.090> bacteria<00:05:08.780> this<00:05:09.289> is<00:05:09.470> my<00:05:09.590> favorite<00:05:10.009> type

00:05:10.210 --> 00:05:10.220 
Square bacteria this is my favorite type

00:05:10.220 --> 00:05:12.909 
Square bacteria this is my favorite type
I<00:05:10.400> find<00:05:10.909> that<00:05:11.090> this<00:05:11.330> type<00:05:12.050> of<00:05:12.080> bacteria<00:05:12.860> is

00:05:12.909 --> 00:05:12.919 
I find that this type of bacteria is

00:05:12.919 --> 00:05:15.550 
I find that this type of bacteria is
really<00:05:13.400> cool<00:05:13.610> I<00:05:13.880> don't<00:05:14.419> know<00:05:14.569> why<00:05:14.840> it's

00:05:15.550 --> 00:05:15.560 
really cool I don't know why it's

00:05:15.560 --> 00:05:18.790 
really cool I don't know why it's
basically<00:05:16.009> a<00:05:16.130> Windows<00:05:17.110> emblem<00:05:18.110> built<00:05:18.440> into

00:05:18.790 --> 00:05:18.800 
basically a Windows emblem built into

00:05:18.800 --> 00:05:21.399 
basically a Windows emblem built into
nature<00:05:19.159> but<00:05:19.729> anyway<00:05:20.000> you<00:05:20.060> have<00:05:20.330> small<00:05:21.139> groups

00:05:21.399 --> 00:05:21.409 
nature but anyway you have small groups

00:05:21.409 --> 00:05:25.809 
nature but anyway you have small groups
of<00:05:21.620> these<00:05:21.770> little<00:05:22.069> square<00:05:22.970> for<00:05:23.479> bacteria<00:05:24.819> here

00:05:25.809 --> 00:05:25.819 
of these little square for bacteria here

00:05:25.819 --> 00:05:27.790 
of these little square for bacteria here
we<00:05:26.150> have<00:05:26.330> star-shaped<00:05:27.050> and<00:05:27.349> as<00:05:27.470> you<00:05:27.620> can<00:05:27.740> see

00:05:27.790 --> 00:05:27.800 
we have star-shaped and as you can see

00:05:27.800 --> 00:05:31.379 
we have star-shaped and as you can see
you<00:05:28.159> kind<00:05:28.460> of<00:05:28.580> get<00:05:28.849> a<00:05:29.319> star<00:05:30.319> shape<00:05:30.830> out<00:05:31.190> of

00:05:31.379 --> 00:05:31.389 
you kind of get a star shape out of

00:05:31.389 --> 00:05:35.560 
you kind of get a star shape out of
these<00:05:33.099> bacteria<00:05:34.099> here<00:05:34.729> it's<00:05:35.150> almost<00:05:35.360> like

00:05:35.560 --> 00:05:35.570 
these bacteria here it's almost like

00:05:35.570 --> 00:05:37.779 
these bacteria here it's almost like
they're<00:05:35.750> connected<00:05:36.349> it<00:05:37.009> looks<00:05:37.250> almost<00:05:37.430> like<00:05:37.669> a

00:05:37.779 --> 00:05:37.789 
they're connected it looks almost like a

00:05:37.789 --> 00:05:41.680 
they're connected it looks almost like a
bunch<00:05:38.120> of<00:05:39.099> bacillus<00:05:40.099> bacteria<00:05:40.880> got<00:05:41.479> together

00:05:41.680 --> 00:05:41.690 
bunch of bacillus bacteria got together

00:05:41.690 --> 00:05:44.260 
bunch of bacillus bacteria got together
and<00:05:42.080> they<00:05:42.169> were<00:05:42.229> like<00:05:42.530> let's<00:05:43.460> form<00:05:44.000> one

00:05:44.260 --> 00:05:44.270 
and they were like let's form one

00:05:44.270 --> 00:05:46.540 
and they were like let's form one
bacteria<00:05:44.840> so<00:05:45.469> I<00:05:45.740> don't<00:05:46.070> know<00:05:46.159> what's<00:05:46.370> up<00:05:46.520> with

00:05:46.540 --> 00:05:46.550 
bacteria so I don't know what's up with

00:05:46.550 --> 00:05:49.810 
bacteria so I don't know what's up with
that<00:05:46.729> but<00:05:47.530> maybe<00:05:48.530> we<00:05:48.949> will<00:05:49.130> learn<00:05:49.280> about<00:05:49.310> it<00:05:49.729> a

00:05:49.810 --> 00:05:49.820 
that but maybe we will learn about it a

00:05:49.820 --> 00:05:53.589 
that but maybe we will learn about it a
little<00:05:50.030> bit<00:05:50.240> more<00:05:50.509> and<00:05:51.789> so<00:05:52.789> that's<00:05:52.969> the<00:05:53.120> basics

00:05:53.589 --> 00:05:53.599 
little bit more and so that's the basics

00:05:53.599 --> 00:05:58.510 
little bit more and so that's the basics
of<00:05:55.810> bacteria<00:05:56.810> and<00:05:57.250> prokaryotic<00:05:58.250> and

00:05:58.510 --> 00:05:58.520 
of bacteria and prokaryotic and

00:05:58.520 --> 00:06:01.029 
of bacteria and prokaryotic and
eukaryotic<00:05:58.690> cells<00:05:59.690> so<00:06:00.469> let<00:06:00.620> me<00:06:00.710> know<00:06:00.830> what<00:06:00.949> you

00:06:01.029 --> 00:06:01.039 
eukaryotic cells so let me know what you

00:06:01.039 --> 00:06:02.649 
eukaryotic cells so let me know what you
think<00:06:01.280> about<00:06:01.340> that<00:06:01.729> I'm<00:06:01.880> gonna<00:06:02.030> be<00:06:02.240> going<00:06:02.270> over

00:06:02.649 --> 00:06:02.659 
think about that I'm gonna be going over

00:06:02.659 --> 00:06:05.589 
think about that I'm gonna be going over
all<00:06:02.840> sorts<00:06:03.259> of<00:06:03.469> stuff<00:06:04.300> hopefully<00:06:05.300> quickly

00:06:05.589 --> 00:06:05.599 
all sorts of stuff hopefully quickly

00:06:05.599 --> 00:06:07.990 
all sorts of stuff hopefully quickly
because<00:06:06.259> I'm<00:06:06.680> gonna<00:06:06.830> be<00:06:07.009> having<00:06:07.699> to<00:06:07.729> get<00:06:07.909> to

00:06:07.990 --> 00:06:08.000 
because I'm gonna be having to get to

00:06:08.000 --> 00:06:10.870 
because I'm gonna be having to get to
bed<00:06:08.150> soon<00:06:08.479> but<00:06:08.949> anyway<00:06:09.949> I<00:06:10.130> hope<00:06:10.370> this<00:06:10.610> helped

00:06:10.870 --> 00:06:10.880 
bed soon but anyway I hope this helped

00:06:10.880 --> 00:06:13.540 
bed soon but anyway I hope this helped
you<00:06:10.969> guys<00:06:11.120> out<00:06:11.919> at<00:06:12.919> least<00:06:13.190> it<00:06:13.430> was

00:06:13.540 --> 00:06:13.550 
you guys out at least it was

00:06:13.550 --> 00:06:16.240 
you guys out at least it was
entertaining<00:06:14.000> but<00:06:14.770> so<00:06:15.770> let<00:06:15.919> me<00:06:15.979> know<00:06:16.099> how<00:06:16.219> I

00:06:16.240 --> 00:06:16.250 
entertaining but so let me know how I

00:06:16.250 --> 00:06:17.350 
entertaining but so let me know how I
did<00:06:16.550> let<00:06:16.759> me<00:06:16.789> know<00:06:16.880> if<00:06:17.060> you<00:06:17.120> have<00:06:17.240> any

00:06:17.350 --> 00:06:17.360 
did let me know if you have any

00:06:17.360 --> 00:06:19.149 
did let me know if you have any
questions<00:06:17.930> I<00:06:18.139> might<00:06:18.289> not<00:06:18.469> get<00:06:18.680> back<00:06:18.710> to<00:06:19.069> you

00:06:19.149 --> 00:06:19.159 
questions I might not get back to you

00:06:19.159 --> 00:06:21.490 
questions I might not get back to you
for<00:06:19.490> a<00:06:19.520> few<00:06:19.610> days<00:06:19.880> it<00:06:20.389> might<00:06:20.539> actually<00:06:20.780> be<00:06:21.199> too

00:06:21.490 --> 00:06:21.500 
for a few days it might actually be too

00:06:21.500 --> 00:06:23.680 
for a few days it might actually be too
late<00:06:21.770> kind<00:06:22.520> of<00:06:22.610> depends<00:06:23.060> if<00:06:23.150> your<00:06:23.330> Monday

00:06:23.680 --> 00:06:23.690 
late kind of depends if your Monday

00:06:23.690 --> 00:06:27.070 
late kind of depends if your Monday
Wednesday<00:06:24.440> or<00:06:24.590> Tuesday<00:06:24.620> Thursday<00:06:25.400> but<00:06:25.930> so<00:06:26.930> go

00:06:27.070 --> 00:06:27.080 
Wednesday or Tuesday Thursday but so go

00:06:33.490 --> 00:06:33.500 
if you have any questions they don't

00:06:33.500 --> 00:06:35.320 
if you have any questions they don't
really<00:06:33.889> have<00:06:34.009> to<00:06:34.159> be<00:06:34.280> about<00:06:34.490> geometry<00:06:34.909> or

00:06:35.320 --> 00:06:35.330 
really have to be about geometry or

00:06:35.330 --> 00:06:37.990 
really have to be about geometry or
biology<00:06:35.740> you<00:06:36.740> know<00:06:36.770> they<00:06:37.039> can<00:06:37.219> be<00:06:37.370> pretty<00:06:37.760> much

00:06:37.990 --> 00:06:38.000 
biology you know they can be pretty much

00:06:38.000 --> 00:06:41.129 
biology you know they can be pretty much
about<00:06:38.240> any<00:06:38.510> subjects<00:06:39.139> school<00:06:39.680> any

00:06:41.129 --> 00:06:41.139 
about any subjects school any

00:06:42.719 --> 00:06:42.729 
objects that we're not covering this

00:06:42.729 --> 00:06:44.700 
objects that we're not covering this
grade<00:06:42.969> pretty<00:06:43.539> much<00:06:43.689> anything<00:06:43.990> I'll<00:06:44.289> try<00:06:44.530> and

00:06:44.700 --> 00:06:44.710 
grade pretty much anything I'll try and
