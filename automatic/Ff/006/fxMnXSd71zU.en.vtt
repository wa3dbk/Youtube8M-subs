that we've made with the icds also on

00:01:09.770 --> 00:01:11.920 
that we've made with the icds also on
our<00:01:09.890> deck<00:01:10.100> our<00:01:10.310> deck<00:01:10.520> is<00:01:10.730> not<00:01:10.940> a<00:01:10.970> 7<00:01:11.390> gauge<00:01:11.570> deck

00:01:11.920 --> 00:01:11.930 
our deck our deck is not a 7 gauge deck

00:01:11.930 --> 00:01:13.720 
our deck our deck is not a 7 gauge deck
and<00:01:12.200> the<00:01:12.260> reason<00:01:12.530> we<00:01:12.620> don't<00:01:12.830> use<00:01:13.100> a<00:01:13.130> 7<00:01:13.550> gauge

00:01:13.720 --> 00:01:13.730 
and the reason we don't use a 7 gauge

00:01:13.730 --> 00:01:16.180 
and the reason we don't use a 7 gauge
deck<00:01:14.060> is<00:01:14.270> 7<00:01:14.990> gauge<00:01:15.200> is<00:01:15.410> a<00:01:15.440> thicker<00:01:15.740> piece<00:01:16.010> of

00:01:16.180 --> 00:01:16.190 
deck is 7 gauge is a thicker piece of

00:01:16.190 --> 00:01:17.830 
deck is 7 gauge is a thicker piece of
metal<00:01:16.370> which<00:01:16.670> means<00:01:16.940> you've<00:01:17.150> got<00:01:17.390> thickness

00:01:17.830 --> 00:01:17.840 
metal which means you've got thickness

00:01:17.840 --> 00:01:19.480 
metal which means you've got thickness
and<00:01:18.049> weight<00:01:18.380> where<00:01:18.590> you<00:01:18.680> don't<00:01:18.860> need<00:01:19.130> it<00:01:19.250> so

00:01:19.480 --> 00:01:19.490 
and weight where you don't need it so

00:01:19.490 --> 00:01:21.640 
and weight where you don't need it so
what<00:01:19.640> we<00:01:19.790> do<00:01:20.000> is<00:01:20.210> make<00:01:20.750> 10<00:01:21.049> gauge<00:01:21.259> decks

00:01:21.640 --> 00:01:21.650 
what we do is make 10 gauge decks

00:01:21.650 --> 00:01:24.069 
what we do is make 10 gauge decks
anyplace<00:01:22.520> that's<00:01:22.820> a<00:01:22.970> stress<00:01:23.240> point<00:01:23.540> or<00:01:23.780> where

00:01:24.069 --> 00:01:24.079 
anyplace that's a stress point or where

00:01:24.079 --> 00:01:26.590 
anyplace that's a stress point or where
point<00:01:24.320> we<00:01:24.950> have<00:01:25.070> a<00:01:25.100> minimum<00:01:25.549> of<00:01:25.700> a<00:01:25.850> double<00:01:26.390> 10

00:01:26.590 --> 00:01:26.600 
point we have a minimum of a double 10

00:01:26.600 --> 00:01:28.359 
point we have a minimum of a double 10
gauge<00:01:26.900> in<00:01:27.140> there<00:01:27.350> so<00:01:27.619> you've<00:01:27.770> actually<00:01:27.979> got

00:01:28.359 --> 00:01:28.369 
gauge in there so you've actually got

00:01:28.369 --> 00:01:30.969 
gauge in there so you've actually got
the<00:01:28.520> strength<00:01:28.790> and<00:01:29.000> the<00:01:29.470> rigidity<00:01:30.470> where<00:01:30.799> you

00:01:30.969 --> 00:01:30.979 
the strength and the rigidity where you

00:01:30.979 --> 00:01:33.899 
the strength and the rigidity where you
need<00:01:31.189> it<00:01:31.540> also<00:01:32.540> on<00:01:32.659> our<00:01:32.689> decks<00:01:33.049> we've<00:01:33.590> got

00:01:33.899 --> 00:01:33.909 
need it also on our decks we've got

00:01:33.909 --> 00:01:36.249 
need it also on our decks we've got
greasable<00:01:34.909> spindles<00:01:35.299> and<00:01:35.479> greasable

00:01:36.249 --> 00:01:36.259 
greasable spindles and greasable

00:01:36.259 --> 00:01:38.170 
greasable spindles and greasable
spindles<00:01:36.680> are<00:01:36.799> important<00:01:37.280> if<00:01:37.490> they<00:01:37.729> are<00:01:37.970> in

00:01:38.170 --> 00:01:38.180 
spindles are important if they are in

00:01:38.180 --> 00:01:40.210 
spindles are important if they are in
fact<00:01:38.479> agreeable<00:01:39.140> bearing<00:01:39.470> and<00:01:39.649> we<00:01:39.740> use<00:01:39.890> one

00:01:40.210 --> 00:01:40.220 
fact agreeable bearing and we use one

00:01:40.220 --> 00:01:42.100 
fact agreeable bearing and we use one

00:01:47.859 --> 00:01:47.869 
greasable bearing which means if you do

00:01:47.869 --> 00:01:49.359 
greasable bearing which means if you do
continue<00:01:48.320> to<00:01:48.409> put<00:01:48.590> grease<00:01:48.799> in<00:01:48.979> there<00:01:49.100> you<00:01:49.219> will

00:01:49.359 --> 00:01:49.369 
continue to put grease in there you will

00:01:49.369 --> 00:01:51.370 
continue to put grease in there you will
blow<00:01:49.579> the<00:01:49.759> seals<00:01:50.000> out<00:01:50.270> so<00:01:50.930> that<00:01:51.079> you<00:01:51.200> don't

all of our high pressure hoses for two
reasons<00:04:44.419> one<00:04:45.289> is<00:04:45.470> that<00:04:45.500> way<00:04:45.860> they're<00:04:46.039> not

00:04:46.059 --> 00:04:46.069 
reasons one is that way they're not

00:04:46.069 --> 00:04:47.830 
reasons one is that way they're not
shaping<00:04:46.490> together<00:04:46.880> and<00:04:47.090> wearing<00:04:47.360> through<00:04:47.630> and

00:04:47.830 --> 00:04:47.840 
shaping together and wearing through and

00:04:47.840 --> 00:04:50.379 
shaping together and wearing through and
the<00:04:48.440> other<00:04:48.620> is<00:04:48.889> that<00:04:49.220> should<00:04:49.639> there<00:04:49.880> a<00:04:50.060> leak

00:04:50.379 --> 00:04:50.389 
the other is that should there a leak

00:04:50.389 --> 00:04:52.960 
the other is that should there a leak
develop<00:04:50.810> in<00:04:50.990> the<00:04:51.199> hoses<00:04:51.590> that<00:04:51.979> will<00:04:52.310> dissipate

00:04:52.960 --> 00:04:52.970 
develop in the hoses that will dissipate

00:04:52.970 --> 00:04:55.689 
develop in the hoses that will dissipate
that<00:04:53.270> leak<00:04:53.599> and<00:04:53.840> not<00:04:54.199> have<00:04:54.470> a<00:04:54.500> solid<00:04:55.340> stream

00:04:55.689 --> 00:04:55.699 
that leak and not have a solid stream

00:04:55.699 --> 00:04:59.800 
that leak and not have a solid stream
coming<00:04:55.970> out<00:04:56.210> and<00:04:56.389> harming<00:04:57.380> the<00:04:57.500> operator<00:04:58.810> the

00:04:59.800 --> 00:04:59.810 
coming out and harming the operator the

00:04:59.810 --> 00:05:02.650 
coming out and harming the operator the
gas<00:05:00.020> tanks<00:05:00.440> on<00:05:00.620> the<00:05:00.770> is<00:05:01.069> 500<00:05:01.759> a<00:05:01.849> rotationally

00:05:04.580 --> 00:05:06.070 
molded instead of being blow molded what
that<00:05:04.729> means<00:05:04.970> is<00:05:05.180> you<00:05:05.330> get<00:05:05.479> a<00:05:05.509> thicker<00:05:05.810> more

00:05:06.070 --> 00:05:06.080 
that means is you get a thicker more

00:05:06.080 --> 00:05:07.839 
that means is you get a thicker more
consistent<00:05:06.680> wall<00:05:06.860> throughout<00:05:07.400> the<00:05:07.520> entire

consistent wall throughout the entire
tank<00:05:08.180> this<00:05:08.870> is<00:05:09.050> good<00:05:09.289> when<00:05:09.500> it<00:05:09.620> comes<00:05:09.800> to

00:05:10.089 --> 00:05:10.099 
tank this is good when it comes to

00:05:10.099 --> 00:05:12.129

going<00:05:33.349> over<00:05:33.500> so<00:05:33.800> that<00:05:33.830> your<00:05:34.069> fumes<00:05:34.520> aren't

00:05:35.439 --> 00:05:35.449 
going over so that your fumes aren't

00:05:37.689 --> 00:05:37.699 
going out into the atmosphere also you

00:05:37.699 --> 00:05:39.939 
going out into the atmosphere also you
have<00:05:37.849> a<00:05:37.880> gas<00:05:38.120> gauge<00:05:38.479> and<00:05:39.139> over<00:05:39.530> here<00:05:39.650> is<00:05:39.710> a<00:05:39.740> cup

00:05:39.939 --> 00:05:39.949 
have a gas gauge and over here is a cup

00:05:39.949 --> 00:05:43.270 
have a gas gauge and over here is a cup
holder<00:05:40.389> we<00:05:41.389> also<00:05:41.539> use<00:05:41.840> a<00:05:41.870> top<00:05:42.229> drop<00:05:42.560> on<00:05:42.830> our<00:05:43.039> gas

00:05:43.270 --> 00:05:43.280 
holder we also use a top drop on our gas

00:05:43.280 --> 00:05:44.890 
holder we also use a top drop on our gas
tanks<00:05:43.699> that's<00:05:43.849> really<00:05:44.150> important<00:05:44.599> for<00:05:44.750> two

00:05:44.890 --> 00:05:44.900 
tanks that's really important for two

00:05:44.900 --> 00:05:47.379 
tanks that's really important for two
reasons<00:05:44.930> one<00:05:45.860> is<00:05:46.159> that<00:05:46.219> when<00:05:47.060> you<00:05:47.180> use<00:05:47.210> a

00:05:47.379 --> 00:05:47.389 
reasons one is that when you use a

00:05:47.389 --> 00:05:49.149 
reasons one is that when you use a
bottom<00:05:47.840> draw<00:05:48.080> like<00:05:48.409> most<00:05:48.740> of<00:05:48.860> our<00:05:48.949> competition

00:05:49.149 --> 00:05:49.159 
bottom draw like most of our competition

00:05:49.159 --> 00:05:51.640 
bottom draw like most of our competition
does<00:05:49.789> all<00:05:50.060> the<00:05:50.300> debris<00:05:50.599> that<00:05:51.020> gets<00:05:51.080> into<00:05:51.500> the

00:05:51.640 --> 00:05:51.650 
does all the debris that gets into the

00:05:51.650 --> 00:05:53.350 
does all the debris that gets into the
tank<00:05:51.889> from<00:05:52.130> filling<00:05:52.520> with<00:05:52.669> your<00:05:52.820> gas<00:05:53.000> cans

00:05:53.350 --> 00:05:53.360 
tank from filling with your gas cans

00:05:53.360 --> 00:05:56.700 
tank from filling with your gas cans
ends<00:05:54.139> up<00:05:54.259> getting<00:05:54.860> pool<00:05:55.490> near<00:05:56.030> that<00:05:56.270> outlet

00:05:56.700 --> 00:05:56.710 
ends up getting pool near that outlet

00:05:56.710 --> 00:05:59.230 
ends up getting pool near that outlet
eventually<00:05:57.710> it<00:05:57.770> gets<00:05:57.919> to<00:05:58.219> your<00:05:58.400> fuel<00:05:58.880> filter

00:05:59.230 --> 00:05:59.240 
eventually it gets to your fuel filter

00:05:59.240 --> 00:06:00.820 
eventually it gets to your fuel filter
