address<00:01:52.159> um<00:01:52.700> and<00:01:53.180> it<00:01:54.049> feels<00:01:54.080> a<00:01:54.560> lot<00:01:54.740> the<00:01:54.920> same

00:01:55.090 --> 00:01:55.100 
address um and it feels a lot the same

00:01:55.100 --> 00:01:58.719 
address um and it feels a lot the same
it<00:01:55.310> has<00:01:55.430> a<00:01:55.460> nice<00:01:56.619> customized<00:01:57.619> UI<00:01:58.070> doesn't<00:01:58.610> look

00:01:58.719 --> 00:01:58.729 
it has a nice customized UI doesn't look

00:01:58.729 --> 00:02:00.969 
it has a nice customized UI doesn't look
like<00:01:58.880> a<00:01:58.909> stock<00:01:59.240> Apple<00:01:59.659> user<00:01:59.840> interface<00:02:00.290> but<00:02:00.890> it

00:02:00.969 --> 00:02:00.979 
like a stock Apple user interface but it

00:02:00.979 --> 00:02:02.410 
like a stock Apple user interface but it
does<00:02:01.130> have<00:02:01.310> its<00:02:01.460> own<00:02:01.610> theme<00:02:02.000> that<00:02:02.210> looks

00:02:02.410 --> 00:02:02.420 
does have its own theme that looks

00:02:02.420 --> 00:02:03.850 
does have its own theme that looks
really<00:02:02.810> nice<00:02:02.960> and<00:02:03.020> works<00:02:03.320> very<00:02:03.409> well<00:02:03.590> together

00:02:03.850 --> 00:02:03.860 
really nice and works very well together

00:02:03.860 --> 00:02:06.520 
really nice and works very well together
so<00:02:04.759> far<00:02:05.000> a<00:02:05.210> little<00:02:05.540> bit<00:02:05.750> of<00:02:05.810> what<00:02:05.930> I<00:02:05.960> noticed<00:02:06.350> is

00:02:06.520 --> 00:02:06.530 
so far a little bit of what I noticed is

00:02:06.530 --> 00:02:09.909 
so far a little bit of what I noticed is
that<00:02:07.000> the<00:02:08.169> scrolling<00:02:09.169> can<00:02:09.469> be<00:02:09.590> a<00:02:09.619> little<00:02:09.739> bit

00:02:09.909 --> 00:02:09.919 
that the scrolling can be a little bit

00:02:09.919 --> 00:02:12.879 
that the scrolling can be a little bit
clunky<00:02:10.189> and<00:02:10.399> not<00:02:10.999> quite<00:02:11.239> as<00:02:11.529> smooth<00:02:12.529> as<00:02:12.769> I

00:02:12.879 --> 00:02:12.889 
clunky and not quite as smooth as I

00:02:12.889 --> 00:02:13.610 
clunky and not quite as smooth as I
would

00:02:13.610 --> 00:02:13.620 
would

00:02:13.620 --> 00:02:14.990 
would
like<00:02:13.890> it<00:02:14.040> to<00:02:14.159> be<00:02:14.280> but<00:02:14.310> you<00:02:14.549> can<00:02:14.670> see<00:02:14.760> you<00:02:14.849> also

00:02:14.990 --> 00:02:15.000 
like it to be but you can see you also

00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:16.850 
like it to be but you can see you also
have<00:02:15.269> the<00:02:15.420> ability<00:02:15.510> to<00:02:15.840> go<00:02:16.409> down<00:02:16.590> and<00:02:16.799> look

00:02:16.850 --> 00:02:16.860 
have the ability to go down and look

00:02:16.860 --> 00:02:18.559 
have the ability to go down and look
like<00:02:17.040> that<00:02:17.250> but<00:02:17.909> it's<00:02:18.030> pretty<00:02:18.180> much<00:02:18.360> my<00:02:18.540> only

00:02:18.559 --> 00:02:18.569 
like that but it's pretty much my only

00:02:18.569 --> 00:02:20.539 
like that but it's pretty much my only
complaint<00:02:19.080> about<00:02:19.200> this<00:02:19.470> so<00:02:19.650> far<00:02:19.890> I<00:02:20.129> haven't

00:02:20.539 --> 00:02:20.549 
complaint about this so far I haven't

00:02:20.549 --> 00:02:22.160 
complaint about this so far I haven't
used<00:02:20.790> it<00:02:20.940> to<00:02:21.090> extensively<00:02:21.569> so<00:02:21.780> I<00:02:21.810> don't<00:02:22.019> know

00:02:22.160 --> 00:02:22.170 
used it to extensively so I don't know

00:02:22.170 --> 00:02:25.640 
used it to extensively so I don't know
how<00:02:23.099> its<00:02:23.280> routing<00:02:23.780> ability<00:02:24.780> is<00:02:25.019> but<00:02:25.349> I<00:02:25.379> assume

00:02:25.640 --> 00:02:25.650 
how its routing ability is but I assume

00:02:25.650 --> 00:02:27.619 
how its routing ability is but I assume
it's<00:02:25.799> just<00:02:26.010> like<00:02:26.159> old<00:02:26.370> google<00:02:26.670> maps<00:02:26.970> so<00:02:27.239> it

00:02:27.619 --> 00:02:27.629 
it's just like old google maps so it

00:02:27.629 --> 00:02:28.940 
it's just like old google maps so it
should<00:02:27.930> be<00:02:27.959> pretty<00:02:28.110> good<00:02:28.349> Google's<00:02:28.830> from

00:02:28.940 --> 00:02:28.950 
should be pretty good Google's from

00:02:28.950 --> 00:02:32.000 
should be pretty good Google's from
doing<00:02:29.129> this<00:02:29.220> for<00:02:29.400> a<00:02:29.459> long<00:02:29.610> time<00:02:30.709> you<00:02:31.709> can<00:02:31.860> go

00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:32.010 
doing this for a long time you can go

00:02:32.010 --> 00:02:34.220 
doing this for a long time you can go
over<00:02:32.040> here<00:02:32.370> and<00:02:32.430> get<00:02:32.640> a<00:02:32.700> few<00:02:33.150> more<00:02:33.329> options<00:02:33.540> you

00:02:34.220 --> 00:02:34.230 
over here and get a few more options you

00:02:34.230 --> 00:02:36.380 
over here and get a few more options you
can<00:02:34.409> turn<00:02:34.500> on<00:02:34.560> traffic<00:02:35.310> reports<00:02:35.760> and<00:02:36.000> that

00:02:36.380 --> 00:02:36.390 
can turn on traffic reports and that

00:02:36.390 --> 00:02:38.990 
can turn on traffic reports and that
will<00:02:36.480> just<00:02:36.510> give<00:02:36.810> you<00:02:37.370> updates<00:02:38.370> about<00:02:38.549> how

00:02:38.990 --> 00:02:39.000 
will just give you updates about how

00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:40.850 
will just give you updates about how
traffic<00:02:39.299> is<00:02:39.569> doing<00:02:39.840> at<00:02:39.930> certain<00:02:40.230> sections<00:02:40.680> you

00:02:40.850 --> 00:02:40.860 
traffic is doing at certain sections you

00:02:40.860 --> 00:02:44.000 
traffic is doing at certain sections you
can<00:02:40.890> see<00:02:41.220> we've<00:02:41.909> got<00:02:42.090> some<00:02:42.390> bad<00:02:42.810> traffic<00:02:43.140> right

00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:44.010 
can see we've got some bad traffic right

00:02:44.010 --> 00:02:46.309 
can see we've got some bad traffic right
around<00:02:44.129> this<00:02:44.370> intersection<00:02:44.940> so<00:02:45.450> wouldn't<00:02:46.260> go

00:02:46.309 --> 00:02:46.319 
around this intersection so wouldn't go

00:02:46.319 --> 00:02:47.449 
around this intersection so wouldn't go
driving<00:02:46.709> through<00:02:46.890> there<00:02:47.040> if<00:02:47.190> I<00:02:47.280> were<00:02:47.430> you

00:02:47.449 --> 00:02:47.459 
driving through there if I were you

00:02:47.459 --> 00:02:49.729 
driving through there if I were you
might<00:02:48.450> have<00:02:48.629> some<00:02:48.810> trouble<00:02:48.840> getting<00:02:49.470> home<00:02:49.620> if

00:02:49.729 --> 00:02:49.739 
might have some trouble getting home if

00:02:49.739 --> 00:02:52.849 
might have some trouble getting home if
you're<00:02:49.829> an<00:02:49.920> apple<00:02:50.099> employee<00:02:51.049> you<00:02:52.049> can<00:02:52.230> look<00:02:52.680> at

00:02:52.849 --> 00:02:52.859 
you're an apple employee you can look at

00:02:52.859 --> 00:02:55.670 
you're an apple employee you can look at
public<00:02:53.340> transit<00:02:53.819> maps<00:02:54.000> and<00:02:54.359> see<00:02:55.049> how<00:02:55.379> you<00:02:55.440> can

00:02:55.670 --> 00:02:55.680 
public transit maps and see how you can

00:02:55.680 --> 00:02:57.740 
public transit maps and see how you can
get<00:02:56.400> there<00:02:56.640> and<00:02:56.790> you<00:02:56.849> can<00:02:56.970> see<00:02:57.120> if<00:02:57.420> you<00:02:57.569> choose

00:02:57.740 --> 00:02:57.750 
get there and you can see if you choose

00:02:57.750 --> 00:03:00.259 
get there and you can see if you choose
the<00:02:57.780> route<00:02:58.079> option<00:02:58.760> once<00:02:59.760> you<00:02:59.879> choose<00:03:00.090> your

00:03:00.259 --> 00:03:00.269 
the route option once you choose your

00:03:00.269 --> 00:03:02.270 
the route option once you choose your
starting<00:03:00.569> point<00:03:00.690> let's<00:03:00.959> say<00:03:01.019> the<00:03:01.280> Empire

00:03:02.270 --> 00:03:02.280 
starting point let's say the Empire

00:03:02.280 --> 00:03:07.460 
starting point let's say the Empire
State<00:03:03.060> Building<00:03:04.400> then<00:03:05.400> it'll<00:03:05.700> start<00:03:06.470> loading

00:03:07.460 --> 00:03:07.470 
State Building then it'll start loading

00:03:07.470 --> 00:03:09.800 
State Building then it'll start loading
that<00:03:07.769> and<00:03:08.069> it'll<00:03:08.190> give<00:03:08.400> us<00:03:08.459> different<00:03:09.299> ways<00:03:09.569> we

00:03:09.800 --> 00:03:09.810 
that and it'll give us different ways we

00:03:09.810 --> 00:03:11.780 
that and it'll give us different ways we
can<00:03:09.959> get<00:03:10.109> there<00:03:10.379> it'll<00:03:11.280> ask<00:03:11.400> you<00:03:11.549> so<00:03:11.670> we're

00:03:11.780 --> 00:03:11.790 
can get there it'll ask you so we're

00:03:11.790 --> 00:03:14.089 
can get there it'll ask you so we're
going<00:03:11.909> to<00:03:12.000> avoid<00:03:12.239> tolls<00:03:12.690> avoid<00:03:13.170> highways<00:03:13.440> and

00:03:14.089 --> 00:03:14.099 
going to avoid tolls avoid highways and

00:03:14.099 --> 00:03:17.650 
going to avoid tolls avoid highways and
it'll<00:03:14.940> give<00:03:15.060> us<00:03:15.120> the<00:03:15.780> options<00:03:16.200> we<00:03:16.379> have<00:03:16.409> so

00:03:17.650 --> 00:03:17.660 
it'll give us the options we have so

00:03:17.660 --> 00:03:20.390 
it'll give us the options we have so
last<00:03:18.660> thing<00:03:18.930> in<00:03:19.230> here<00:03:19.470> is<00:03:19.530> the<00:03:19.919> satellite

00:03:20.390 --> 00:03:20.400 
last thing in here is the satellite

00:03:20.400 --> 00:03:23.120 
last thing in here is the satellite
which<00:03:20.639> obviously<00:03:21.329> it<00:03:21.780> brings<00:03:22.650> up<00:03:22.889> the

00:03:23.120 --> 00:03:23.130 
which obviously it brings up the

00:03:23.130 --> 00:03:24.710 
which obviously it brings up the
satellite<00:03:23.400> view<00:03:23.880> so<00:03:24.030> you<00:03:24.060> can<00:03:24.180> zoom<00:03:24.510> in<00:03:24.690> and

00:03:24.710 --> 00:03:24.720 
satellite view so you can zoom in and

00:03:24.720 --> 00:03:28.430 
satellite view so you can zoom in and
actually<00:03:25.410> see<00:03:25.889> the<00:03:26.459> pictures<00:03:26.910> of<00:03:27.440> actual

00:03:28.430 --> 00:03:28.440 
actually see the pictures of actual

00:03:28.440 --> 00:03:32.270 
actually see the pictures of actual
houses<00:03:28.889> from<00:03:29.220> satellite<00:03:30.209> images<00:03:30.720> and<00:03:31.280> that

00:03:32.270 --> 00:03:32.280 
houses from satellite images and that

00:03:32.280 --> 00:03:33.860 
houses from satellite images and that
basically<00:03:32.519> sums<00:03:33.000> up<00:03:33.239> it's<00:03:33.389> a<00:03:33.450> pretty<00:03:33.629> simple

00:03:33.860 --> 00:03:33.870 
basically sums up it's a pretty simple

00:03:33.870 --> 00:03:37.610 
basically sums up it's a pretty simple
interface<00:03:35.299> and<00:03:36.299> also<00:03:36.599> you<00:03:36.660> have<00:03:37.019> the<00:03:37.049> option

00:03:37.610 --> 00:03:37.620 
interface and also you have the option

00:03:37.620 --> 00:03:41.089 
interface and also you have the option
to<00:03:37.650> log<00:03:37.889> in<00:03:38.160> to<00:03:38.400> like<00:03:38.609> save<00:03:39.389> your<00:03:40.099> favorite
