00:00:05.580 --> 00:00:09.000
 technology already know everything they have 

00:00:07.259 --> 00:00:10.769
 what to do with your likes recommendations 

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:13.290
 and all those very good things give you a 

00:00:10.769 --> 00:00:15.900
 like please and we started what is a 

00:00:13.290 --> 00:00:17.550
 nano note and tec a by things that then for 

00:00:15.900 --> 00:00:19.050
 the week I could not record what they are 

00:00:17.550 --> 00:00:20.400
 news and now I had I'm going almost from 

00:00:19.050 --> 00:00:23.400
 because it's going to be my birthday 

00:00:20.400 --> 00:00:25.050
 on Monday then I wanted to record this 

00:00:23.400 --> 00:00:27.449
 quickly so they had a 

00:00:25.050 --> 00:00:29.160
 news material although the week 

00:00:27.449 --> 00:00:31.560
 was very slow on what is technology 

00:00:29.160 --> 00:00:34.620
 There were many things but we 

00:00:31.560 --> 00:00:37.380
 directly right now to see or talk about 

00:00:34.620 --> 00:00:38.579
 what will this news be to all 

00:00:37.380 --> 00:00:40.350
 this news as you can always 

00:00:38.579 --> 00:00:42.149
 find in mister amigo text puntocom 

00:00:40.350 --> 00:00:44.250
 ba1 already to the first one that is the 

00:00:42.149 --> 00:00:46.950
 update of facebook in if already 

00:00:44.250 --> 00:00:50.700
 you have updated your iphone to that is 

00:00:46.950 --> 00:00:53.190
 so as not to attack forgiveness but for 

00:00:50.700 --> 00:00:55.050
 help him a little bit the people who have ios 

00:00:53.190 --> 00:00:57.390
 because android just launched the 

00:00:55.050 --> 00:00:59.670
 last week with a facebook with no 

00:00:57.390 --> 00:01:01.440
 It was very good and we are working on 

00:00:59.670 --> 00:01:03.170
 get a device to install 

00:01:01.440 --> 00:01:06.080
 this we do not have an android 

00:01:03.170 --> 00:01:08.570
 but good for it is that 

00:01:06.080 --> 00:01:12.229
 solution if you have the updated to 6.0 

00:01:08.570 --> 00:01:14.000
 even if you have the break but already 6.0 you go 

00:01:12.229 --> 00:01:15.950
 to be able to update to this new 

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:18.140
 application is updated is your application 

00:01:15.950 --> 00:01:21.200
 of facebook you will find this new 

00:01:18.140 --> 00:01:23.390
 interface that is not bigger but if it gives you 

00:01:21.200 --> 00:01:25.130
 what is the chat now just be inside 

00:01:23.390 --> 00:01:26.509
 of the application you can communicate and 

00:01:25.130 --> 00:01:29.000
 to the occupying state and the truth is very 

00:01:26.509 --> 00:01:31.549
 simple I like that it is very intuitive 

00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:32.780
 find the little bubbles on the part of 

00:01:31.549 --> 00:01:35.420
 up here you can see a couple of photos 

00:01:32.780 --> 00:01:38.390
 more and there's an explanation to that mario 

00:01:35.420 --> 00:01:39.800
 he wrote as very interesting to a 

00:01:38.390 --> 00:01:41.330
 very good solution also for 

00:01:39.800 --> 00:01:43.250
 conversations since you can be in the 

00:01:41.330 --> 00:01:45.229
 facebook application and follow the 

00:01:43.250 --> 00:01:46.970
 conversations with your friends without not 

00:01:45.229 --> 00:01:49.130
 importing themes in the application 

00:01:46.970 --> 00:01:50.899
 you have that conversation over that is 

00:01:49.130 --> 00:01:51.590
 something similar to what they want to do with 

00:01:50.899 --> 00:01:53.450
 Facebook 

00:01:51.590 --> 00:01:55.520
 but of course it will be much more integrated 

00:01:53.450 --> 00:01:57.799
 in what is android is to each other or 

00:01:55.520 --> 00:02:00.229
 be that it is also application people who 

00:01:57.799 --> 00:02:02.390
 will be sweater new arrived hashtag news 

00:02:00.229 --> 00:02:04.759
 and the application of what is twitter 

00:02:02.390 --> 00:02:06.380
 now it's a completely application 

00:02:04.759 --> 00:02:07.409
 new has only come out now for 

00:02:06.380 --> 00:02:09.720
 also ios 

00:02:07.409 --> 00:02:11.730
 I'm not guilty and other people say ah here 

00:02:09.720 --> 00:02:13.349
 had now only ios 

00:02:11.730 --> 00:02:15.090
 very soon I think it will come out stopping 

00:02:13.349 --> 00:02:16.620
 have to go out for android is a 

00:02:15.090 --> 00:02:18.420
 application very apart from what it is 

00:02:16.620 --> 00:02:19.830
 twitter do not think that because you already have 

00:02:18.420 --> 00:02:21.840
 twitter you have this application you are going to 

00:02:19.830 --> 00:02:23.430
 have to go down separately or if you have a 

00:02:21.840 --> 00:02:24.920
 account here in the USA you will be able to 

00:02:23.430 --> 00:02:28.110
 download because it is not available 

00:02:24.920 --> 00:02:30.390
 fattening part of the world but good to 

00:02:28.110 --> 00:02:33.090
 this application works that links it 

00:02:30.390 --> 00:02:34.920
 with what other applications are 

00:02:33.090 --> 00:02:36.840
 you have to have a service like radio 

00:02:34.920 --> 00:02:38.970
 that we were to the application between the 

00:02:36.840 --> 00:02:41.690
 week or what is spotify that always 

00:02:38.970 --> 00:02:43.950
 we passed recommending then it's 

00:02:41.690 --> 00:02:45.569
 practically a social network so that 

00:02:43.950 --> 00:02:48.150
 you can share and know what music 

00:02:45.569 --> 00:02:50.280
 your friends are listening but if not 

00:02:48.150 --> 00:02:52.650
 you have no paid music service 

00:02:50.280 --> 00:02:54.120
 then you can not listen to the music in 

00:02:52.650 --> 00:02:56.430
 whole or you can comment and 

00:02:54.120 --> 00:02:58.240
 itunes and gives you as a preview of what 

00:02:56.430 --> 00:03:00.910
 what is the song but 

00:02:58.240 --> 00:03:02.710
 it's one thing that I thought that twitter was going 

00:03:00.910 --> 00:03:04.690
 is it like your own database of 

00:03:02.710 --> 00:03:07.600
 music but maybe it was going to be too 

00:03:04.690 --> 00:03:09.520
 very complicated but if you have spotify 

00:03:07.600 --> 00:03:11.920
 and you want to see what music list they follow 

00:03:09.520 --> 00:03:13.570
 your favorite artists or I do one 

00:03:11.920 --> 00:03:15.670
 list that someone is putting together your 

00:03:13.570 --> 00:03:17.530
 friends put together lists 

00:03:15.670 --> 00:03:19.660
 of your friends on twitter then you go to 

00:03:17.530 --> 00:03:21.520
 being able to share that music seems like a 

00:03:19.660 --> 00:03:23.740
 good choice I would have liked to see a 

00:03:21.520 --> 00:03:25.120
 integration more than what is music from 

00:03:23.740 --> 00:03:26.350
 them since now it has been done 

00:03:25.120 --> 00:03:28.480
 problem that you have to have a 

00:03:26.350 --> 00:03:30.280
 service as spotify I have it in 

00:03:28.480 --> 00:03:32.830
 this case but I know that many years out 

00:03:30.280 --> 00:03:34.480
 no but it is the situation that has happened 

00:03:32.830 --> 00:03:36.460
 with that application let's go to other 

00:03:34.480 --> 00:03:39.340
 news a little bit different from what 

00:03:36.460 --> 00:03:42.310
 we talk here on the channel but youtube has 

00:03:39.340 --> 00:03:44.680
 seen triumph and also to defeat the 

00:03:42.310 --> 00:03:46.420
 people you know that making videos in 

00:03:44.680 --> 00:03:48.190
 Youtube sometimes quite difficult but 

00:03:46.420 --> 00:03:50.680
 some people are doing very well like 

00:03:48.190 --> 00:03:53.320
 lord of candance time last year 

00:03:50.680 --> 00:03:55.570
 he made 8 billion view people in a 

00:03:53.320 --> 00:03:57.790
 just video is amazing one of the 

00:03:55.570 --> 00:03:59.440
 most watched videos and now it's just taken 

00:03:57.790 --> 00:04:01.630
 a song that is not so good that 

00:03:59.440 --> 00:04:02.770
 it's called james and now it's 

00:04:01.630 --> 00:04:04.350
 the moment I gave it to him that the 

00:04:02.770 --> 00:04:06.820
 article because I was going 

00:04:04.350 --> 00:04:09.880
 58 but when I ordered it from 

00:04:06.820 --> 00:04:11.770
 check was going for 180 million views 

00:04:09.880 --> 00:04:14.560
 so the song is so kind of funny 

00:04:11.770 --> 00:04:16.989
 is not good salvage is not 

00:04:14.560 --> 00:04:19.270
 good 180 million view people is 

00:04:16.989 --> 00:04:21.370
 amazing good people that's why I love myself 

00:04:19.270 --> 00:04:22.930
 go saying goodbye in what is gaming 

00:04:21.370 --> 00:04:25.180
 it's not been long either we know that the 

00:04:22.930 --> 00:04:27.880
 xbox we are waiting for you for the 21 

00:04:25.180 --> 00:04:30.280
 May go to do the conference and 

00:04:27.880 --> 00:04:32.080
 playstation 4 came out to say so 

00:04:30.280 --> 00:04:35.800
 I was waiting for news of precision 4 

00:04:32.080 --> 00:04:38.290
 for they have come to say that for what 

00:04:35.800 --> 00:04:38.800
 is that they will continue to sell the play 

00:04:38.290 --> 00:04:41.950
 station 

00:04:38.800 --> 00:04:44.050
 the 3 that was something obvious practically not 

00:04:41.950 --> 00:04:45.910
 it was no wonder it's going to stay 

00:04:44.050 --> 00:04:47.980
 that is if you already have a playstation3 

00:04:45.910 --> 00:04:49.840
 minimum after accuracy comes out 4 

00:04:47.980 --> 00:04:52.210
 will live about two years plus the price 3 

00:04:49.840 --> 00:04:54.430
 they are going to take out games two things what you 

00:04:52.210 --> 00:04:56.170
 will fail are graphs and things like that 

00:04:54.430 --> 00:04:58.600
 but they will always see the same games 

00:04:56.170 --> 00:05:00.670
 practically be inside maybe you 

00:04:58.600 --> 00:05:02.470
 change some characteristics but not 

00:05:00.670 --> 00:05:04.390
 they are going to be older very much like what 

00:05:02.470 --> 00:05:06.400
 they did when playstation 3 came out and 

00:05:04.390 --> 00:05:07.480
 they kept the weight for a long time 

00:05:06.400 --> 00:05:09.419
 I think you can still buy 

00:05:07.480 --> 00:05:13.289
 precision 2 

00:05:09.419 --> 00:05:17.110
 with that I leave and tomorrow there will not be 

00:05:13.289 --> 00:05:19.419
 I will go for a while with my wife then 

00:05:17.110 --> 00:05:21.720
 to compensate them what I bring them is 

00:05:19.419 --> 00:05:23.910
 the unboxing people 

00:05:21.720 --> 00:05:26.160
 blackberry set there were people that I 

00:05:23.910 --> 00:05:27.870

00:05:27.870 --> 00:05:31.410

00:05:31.410 --> 00:05:35.370

00:05:33.210 --> 00:05:37.170
