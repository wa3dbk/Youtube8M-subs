00:00:00.367 --> 00:00:03.102
 We have three people: Jenna, Sara and Bill, 

00:00:03.102 --> 00:00:06.233
 who track their weight. 

00:00:06.233 --> 00:00:10.166
 In particular, they track their weight 

00:00:10.166 --> 00:00:11.620
 within a month. 

00:00:11.620 --> 00:00:13.418
 Here we have the change in weight 

00:00:13.418 --> 00:00:14.423
 during the month. 

00:00:14.423 --> 00:00:16.206
 If you take their final weight 

00:00:16.206 --> 00:00:18.666
 and you get your starting weight ... 

00:00:18.666 --> 00:00:21.874
 Let me transcribe this, we have the final weight 

00:00:21.874 --> 00:00:23.930
 minus the initial weight. 

00:00:23.930 --> 00:00:27.584
 This will be the change in weight this month. 

00:00:27.584 --> 00:00:30.300
 Here we have the change in weight. 

00:00:30.300 --> 00:00:32.911
 Jenna's weight change 

00:00:32.911 --> 00:00:35.382
 is minus 3 pounds, 

00:00:35.382 --> 00:00:38.133
 which means she has lost weight. 

00:00:38.133 --> 00:00:41.300
 The weight change of Sarah is plus 2 1/2 pounds, 

00:00:41.300 --> 00:00:43.766
 which means it has filled 2 1/2 pounds. 

00:00:43.766 --> 00:00:48.634
 And then the change in Bill's weight is plus 4 pounds, 

00:00:48.634 --> 00:00:51.166
 which means he has filled 4 pounds in the month. 

00:00:51.166 --> 00:00:53.700
 Having this information, let us answer a few questions. 

00:00:53.700 --> 00:00:55.567
 Who has lost the most? 

00:00:55.567 --> 00:00:57.702
 Who has had the biggest change in weight? 

00:00:57.702 --> 00:00:59.425
 And who had the least weight change? 

00:00:59.425 --> 00:01:00.876
 I recommend that you pause the video 

00:01:00.876 --> 00:01:03.363
 and try to do it yourself. 

00:01:03.363 --> 00:01:07.100
 Okay, let's just do all this stuff 

00:01:07.100 --> 00:01:09.907
 on a numerical axis that will help us think, 

00:01:09.907 --> 00:01:13.502
 although some of you may already have answered the questions. 

00:01:13.502 --> 00:01:17.333
 Jenna's weight change is minus 3 pounds. 

00:01:17.333 --> 00:01:19.502
 That's Jenna. 

00:01:19.502 --> 00:01:21.666
 I will mention Jenna with J. 

00:01:21.666 --> 00:01:25.234
 Sara's weight change - she's filled 

00:01:25.234 --> 00:01:28.800
 with 2 1/2 pounds, so we'll be doing that here. 

00:01:28.800 --> 00:01:31.702
 Plus 2 1/2 pounds for Sarah. 

00:01:31.702 --> 00:01:34.300
 And finally, Bill has uploaded 4 pounds, 

00:01:34.300 --> 00:01:37.468
 here's Bill. 

00:01:37.468 --> 00:01:40.401
 Now let's answer the question who has lost the most? 

00:01:40.401 --> 00:01:43.206
 When we talk about weight loss, we are interested in directions, 

00:01:43.206 --> 00:01:45.399
 and we say, "Who has moved 

00:01:45.399 --> 00:01:48.299
 farthest to the left of 0? " 

00:01:48.299 --> 00:01:51.094
 Well, Sara and Bill have not moved to the left at all. 

00:01:51.094 --> 00:01:52.333
 They have gained weight. 

00:01:52.333 --> 00:01:53.800
 That's why they are to the right of 0. 

00:01:53.800 --> 00:01:55.876
 Jenna is the only person to take off something. 

00:01:55.876 --> 00:01:59.468
 So the man who has the most weight is Jenna. 

00:02:00.068 --> 00:02:02.470
 What is the biggest change? 

00:02:02.470 --> 00:02:03.771
 Let's think about the biggest change, 

00:02:03.771 --> 00:02:05.000
 one way to do this is to see 

00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:07.469
 who has gone as much as 0? 

00:02:07.469 --> 00:02:08.866
 Let's see it as 

00:02:08.866 --> 00:02:12.169
 which of these is the highest absolute value? 

00:02:12.169 --> 00:02:14.833
 Well the absolute value here 

00:02:14.833 --> 00:02:18.333
 to minus 3 is - just like we can call it 

00:02:18.333 --> 00:02:20.830
 absolute change, 

00:02:23.416 --> 00:02:25.601
 will be the absolute value, 

00:02:25.601 --> 00:02:29.034
 and the absolute value of minus 3 is plus 3. 

00:02:29.034 --> 00:02:32.915
 The absolute value of 2.5 

00:02:32.915 --> 00:02:35.478
 is 2.5. 

00:02:35.478 --> 00:02:38.701
 Let me write it a bit clearer. 

00:02:38.701 --> 00:02:42.733
 The absolute value of 4 is simply equal to 4. 

00:02:42.733 --> 00:02:45.001
 Who had the greatest absolute change? 

00:02:45.001 --> 00:02:47.158
 Well Bill had the biggest absolute change, 

00:02:47.158 --> 00:02:48.650
 and secondly she was actually Jenna. 

00:02:48.650 --> 00:02:50.749
 It has lowered weight, but it has changed quite a bit. 

00:02:50.749 --> 00:02:52.289
 It had a change of 3 pounds, 

00:02:52.289 --> 00:02:54.217
 although this is a download of 3 pounds. 

00:02:54.217 --> 00:02:55.834
 He had uploaded 4 pounds. 

00:02:55.834 --> 00:02:59.617
 But the biggest change is definitely with Bill. 

00:03:00.833 --> 00:03:03.267
 And who had the slightest change? 

00:03:03.267 --> 00:03:03.973
 Another way to look at it, 

00:03:03.973 --> 00:03:05.870
 is that this is the smallest absolute change. 

00:03:05.870 --> 00:03:09.467
 Who has shifted at least from 0? 

00:03:09.467 --> 00:03:10.284
 If you look here, 

00:03:10.284 --> 00:03:14.100
 Sarah had the slightest absolute change. 

00:03:14.100 --> 00:03:17.966
 Jenna has lost weight, so Jenna's weight change 

00:03:17.966 --> 00:03:21.369
 is minus 3 against plus 2.5 on Sarah. 

00:03:21.369 --> 00:03:24.386
 But if we talk about it, who has the slightest change from 0. 

00:03:24.386 --> 00:03:25.586
 If your weight change was 0, 

00:03:25.586 --> 00:03:26.976
 that you did not upload or lose weight 

00:03:26.976 --> 00:03:29.139
 from the beginning to the end of the month. 

00:03:29.139 --> 00:03:30.038
 So who has the least change? 

00:03:30.038 --> 00:03:32.564
 Well this will be the smallest absolute change. 

00:03:32.564 --> 00:03:33.971
 Okay, we see this right here. 

00:03:33.971 --> 00:03:38.534
 2.5 is less than 3 or 4. 

00:03:38.534 --> 00:03:43.246
 So the smallest weight change is on Sarah. 

00:03:43.246 --> 00:03:45.047
 And we're ready.
