00:00:14.690 --> 00:00:19.460
 Welcome to a new video 

00:00:16.950 --> 00:00:21.840
 on mtv news 

00:00:19.460 --> 00:00:23.250
 today it's about a cd i think so 

00:00:21.840 --> 00:00:25.200
 have never done anything about a cd 

00:00:23.250 --> 00:00:28.710
 but never over singles 

00:00:25.200 --> 00:00:34.850
 about an album and that's about the 

00:00:28.710 --> 00:00:37.590
 blood on the dance floor cd and yes me 

00:00:34.850 --> 00:00:39.000
 hope it brings you something further if 

00:00:37.590 --> 00:00:41.580
 I do not like a problem-is coming 

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:44.309
 still new reviews and a lot of fun 

00:00:41.580 --> 00:00:46.620
 yes, the album blood on the dance 

00:00:44.309 --> 00:00:49.110
 floor has been eight million times 

00:00:46.620 --> 00:00:51.629
 sold and is even that 

00:00:49.110 --> 00:00:53.610
 most successful remix album in the world 

00:00:51.629 --> 00:00:57.600
 yes you heard right it is 

00:00:53.610 --> 00:00:59.220
 actually only a remix album which I 

00:00:57.600 --> 00:01:03.600
 but actually as a real album man 

00:00:59.220 --> 00:01:06.500
 See, yes, come to the future 

00:01:03.600 --> 00:01:08.760
 the good ones are on it 

00:01:06.500 --> 00:01:10.500
 oh well, now I would like to have that 

00:01:08.760 --> 00:01:12.360
 gutm knew of her the picture here 

00:01:10.500 --> 00:01:14.180
 I did not know him but painted me 

00:01:12.360 --> 00:01:19.500
 can give them yes Show times and that 

00:01:14.180 --> 00:01:20.899
 here yes the cd looks so knows 

00:01:19.500 --> 00:01:22.829
 probably everyone 

00:01:20.899 --> 00:01:25.890
 and there you see me in the mirror 

00:01:22.829 --> 00:01:26.930
 I do not care, I'll just go now 

00:01:25.890 --> 00:01:30.630
 open 

00:01:26.930 --> 00:01:33.780
 that looks from the inside out so I think so 

00:01:30.630 --> 00:01:35.549
 pretty much the cd is also with 

00:01:33.780 --> 00:01:37.979
 my favorite cd or she is 

00:01:35.549 --> 00:01:40.820
 Actually, it has always been me 

00:01:37.979 --> 00:01:43.109
 I've always loved this cd 

00:01:40.820 --> 00:01:47.909
 I will show you the booklet as well 

00:01:43.109 --> 00:01:48.929
 once again the back yes the 

00:01:47.909 --> 00:01:51.509
 As always, I will become a singer of course 

00:01:48.929 --> 00:01:53.609
 do not enumerate but I hold that 

00:01:51.509 --> 00:01:54.990
 now ran and you are welcome then on 

00:01:53.609 --> 00:01:59.249
 stop making your tracklist 

00:01:54.990 --> 00:02:00.770
 I hope so I hope so 

00:01:59.249 --> 00:02:03.630
 sharp enough 

00:02:00.770 --> 00:02:06.780
 yes the album is actually one 

00:02:03.630 --> 00:02:10.020
 remix album, however, are the first 

00:02:06.780 --> 00:02:12.300
 five songs completely unpublished 

00:02:10.020 --> 00:02:13.980
 songs that were not accident until then 

00:02:12.300 --> 00:02:16.560
 on blood on the dance floor the first 

00:02:13.980 --> 00:02:18.690
 song of course is already known 

00:02:16.560 --> 00:02:19.550
 I have been single and before 

00:02:18.690 --> 00:02:21.690
 as a video 

00:02:19.550 --> 00:02:23.060
 maybe it came out at the same time 

00:02:21.690 --> 00:02:24.780
 I can not say right now 

00:02:23.060 --> 00:02:28.200
 definitely 

00:02:24.780 --> 00:02:32.310
 the song is so successful and the video 

00:02:28.200 --> 00:02:33.240
 probably also know many in 1997 

00:02:32.310 --> 00:02:35.580
 appeared 

00:02:33.240 --> 00:02:37.590
 so now I want to go back to 

00:02:35.580 --> 00:02:39.600
 booklet look into the booklet i watch 

00:02:37.590 --> 00:02:41.610
 never really pure 

00:02:39.600 --> 00:02:45.000
 in that case, because I have the booklet 

00:02:41.610 --> 00:02:47.420
 I think that's pretty cool 

00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:49.260
 made a lot of effort 

00:02:47.420 --> 00:02:52.170
 Of course these are the lyrics 

00:02:49.260 --> 00:02:54.270
 included moment now one page 

00:02:52.170 --> 00:02:55.739
 of course in the right way 

00:02:54.270 --> 00:02:59.209
 order everything and so on me 

00:02:55.739 --> 00:02:59.209
 I will not show everything again 

00:03:00.110 --> 00:03:04.410
 close is nothing great now 

00:03:02.250 --> 00:03:05.970
 special is not elaborate anyway 

00:03:04.410 --> 00:03:08.459
 I think it's nice against the pictures 

00:03:05.970 --> 00:03:20.610
 also and very good 

00:03:08.459 --> 00:03:22.800
 the bread you quality again yes 

00:03:20.610 --> 00:03:24.840
 from this side who is that 

00:03:22.800 --> 00:03:27.300
 even that album concerns it 

00:03:24.840 --> 00:03:30.299
 there is another story about the song 

00:03:27.300 --> 00:03:33.600
 good on the dancefloor is the rush 

00:03:30.299 --> 00:03:37.410
 I'll see you soon, I hope you have it 

00:03:33.600 --> 00:03:38.970
 further brought the cd is still synonymous 

00:03:37.410 --> 00:03:40.140
 in new condition, there is also belief 

00:03:38.970 --> 00:03:41.730
 I as a plate I unfortunately do not have them 

00:03:40.140 --> 00:03:45.200
 as a flat would be great if I hammer her 

00:03:41.730 --> 00:03:45.200
 could someday get as a plate 

00:03:45.799 --> 00:03:50.640
 I think the cd costs around 15 euros 

00:03:48.750 --> 00:03:52.829
 if you get it used neukauf 

00:03:50.640 --> 00:03:56.030
 I think so from three euros or 

00:03:52.829 --> 00:04:02.970
 so would have to look at Amazon ebay 

00:03:56.030 --> 00:04:04.410
 yes yes the cd you can I have just 

00:04:02.970 --> 00:04:05.280
 I think I could say it everywhere 

00:04:04.410 --> 00:04:08.430
 still get it 

00:04:05.280 --> 00:04:11.489
 also in new and now we come to the 

00:04:08.430 --> 00:04:13.049
 story that I wanted to tell and 

00:04:11.489 --> 00:04:16.019
 I'll try it out of my head 

00:04:13.049 --> 00:04:17.669
 have the times on the internet found Read 

00:04:16.019 --> 00:04:20.370
 but I do not have it anymore 

00:04:17.669 --> 00:04:21.989
 definitely found again to the 

00:04:20.370 --> 00:04:24.750
 song good on the dancefloor 

00:04:21.989 --> 00:04:28.979
 I wonder if he knew that 

00:04:24.750 --> 00:04:31.310
 song originally written in 1990 

00:04:28.979 --> 00:04:34.009
 was and also produced and indeed 

00:04:31.310 --> 00:04:37.280
 should that teddy riley 

00:04:34.009 --> 00:04:40.169
 as a producer should this song 

00:04:37.280 --> 00:04:41.759
 produce and in the beginning this was called 

00:04:40.169 --> 00:04:45.750
 Song professional so it was probably 

00:04:41.759 --> 00:04:47.759
 just a demo name but white 

00:04:45.750 --> 00:04:49.830
 I may not have the text, too 

00:04:47.759 --> 00:04:51.930
 still no idea in any case 

00:04:49.830 --> 00:04:53.780
 there is a cool story about it and 

00:04:51.930 --> 00:04:56.460
 Although it was actually I think so 

00:04:53.780 --> 00:05:00.509
 that michael and teddy this album title 

00:04:56.460 --> 00:05:01.680
 the songtitel did not know exactly 

00:05:00.509 --> 00:05:06.090
 or did not know what it was 

00:05:01.680 --> 00:05:09.320
 and teddy was definitely there 

00:05:06.090 --> 00:05:11.430
 invited riley to a birthday 

00:05:09.320 --> 00:05:13.050
 had them but then canceled 

00:05:11.430 --> 00:05:14.970
 in the end , he preferred this one 

00:05:13.050 --> 00:05:18.720
 wanted to continue working on this job 

00:05:14.970 --> 00:05:23.840
 song and later then learned that 

00:05:18.720 --> 00:05:25.800
 someone was shot dead at the party 

00:05:23.840 --> 00:05:26.880
 that's not cool at the time 

00:05:25.800 --> 00:05:30.510
 story but the cool thing about the 

00:05:26.880 --> 00:05:32.400
 history is that he meant later 

00:05:30.510 --> 00:05:34.199
 asked how he called the zhong 

00:05:32.400 --> 00:05:38.520
 like or like the song 

00:05:34.199 --> 00:05:41.310
 should be called and he then said blood 

00:05:38.520 --> 00:05:43.770
 on the dance floor and definitely 

00:05:41.310 --> 00:05:46.590
 He could not not fit that 

00:05:43.770 --> 00:05:49.500
 because it's totally connected 

00:05:46.590 --> 00:05:51.900
 yes, but blood on the dance floor and he 

00:05:49.500 --> 00:05:54.240
 I was just invited to a party 

00:05:51.900 --> 00:05:58.500
 who did not go is probably someone 

00:05:54.240 --> 00:06:01.590
 was shot and so on and that 

00:05:58.500 --> 00:06:05.760
 was probably a magical moment so stood 

00:06:01.590 --> 00:06:08.419
 it there and yes i will be there now 

00:06:05.760 --> 00:06:10.560
 Do not translate under dancefloor because 

00:06:08.419 --> 00:06:13.530
 many may also speak english from 

00:06:10.560 --> 00:06:16.580
 you yes I hope you knew that 

00:06:13.530 --> 00:06:18.449
 history not yet and I hope you 

00:06:16.580 --> 00:06:20.159
 come up with something to do with it maybe 

00:06:18.449 --> 00:06:21.810
 it was also extremely uninteresting though 

00:06:20.159 --> 00:06:22.889
 I found the story totally cold me 

00:06:21.810 --> 00:06:23.789
 she has read that is also first 

00:06:22.889 --> 00:06:24.479
 Last year I believe in the internet 

00:06:23.789 --> 00:06:26.909
 come 

00:06:24.479 --> 00:06:30.300
 but I also think it's crass that the 

00:06:26.909 --> 00:06:32.220
 hommes 1990 was already produced and 

00:06:30.300 --> 00:06:34.590
 finally, seven years later 

00:06:32.220 --> 00:06:35.320
 has appeared since you can really see how 

00:06:34.590 --> 00:06:37.210
 Long 

00:06:35.320 --> 00:06:40.390
 I had worked different songs 

00:06:37.210 --> 00:06:42.520
 I also do music and I think so 

00:06:40.390 --> 00:06:45.400
 the longest thing i have for a song so 

00:06:42.520 --> 00:06:46.870
 the longest so I do not have two 

00:06:45.400 --> 00:06:48.250
 years worked in song i have you 

00:06:46.870 --> 00:06:49.630
 found again after two years and 

00:06:48.250 --> 00:06:49.960
 thought you never could help me 

00:06:49.630 --> 00:06:52.450
 made 

00:06:49.960 --> 00:06:54.280
 that was the way it was, but I think so 

00:06:52.450 --> 00:06:55.110
 I would never listen to a song for so long 

00:06:54.280 --> 00:06:57.190
 work 

00:06:55.110 --> 00:06:59.040
 Of course , ok still has to take here 

00:06:57.190 --> 00:07:01.150
 other things made other albums though 

00:06:59.040 --> 00:07:03.160
 Nevertheless, the song ultimately has 

00:07:01.150 --> 00:07:05.080
 It took seven years to get ready 

00:07:03.160 --> 00:07:07.330
 and you just see how 

00:07:05.080 --> 00:07:08.110
 a lot of work is done and the 

00:07:07.330 --> 00:07:10.270
 song is also mine 

00:07:08.110 --> 00:07:12.760
 That's why it has become favorite songs 

00:07:10.270 --> 00:07:16.300
 in any case succeeded for me yes 

00:07:12.760 --> 00:07:17.710
 Of course you should still 

00:07:16.300 --> 00:07:19.450
 to stop by the last videos 

00:07:17.710 --> 00:07:20.560
 or the last last video 

00:07:19.450 --> 00:07:24.540
 I do not know exactly now 

00:07:20.560 --> 00:07:26.740
 which is because I review this 

00:07:24.540 --> 00:07:28.840
 in addition, she has turned in advance 

00:07:26.740 --> 00:07:29.950
 right now but she will not be today 

00:07:28.840 --> 00:07:31.780
 That's why I do not have any 

00:07:29.950 --> 00:07:35.550
 I do not know if the last video is from me 

00:07:31.780 --> 00:07:37.900
 or tim, just click on it 

00:07:35.550 --> 00:07:39.550
 what you see here now and then 

00:07:37.900 --> 00:07:42.940
 you come to the last video of whom too 

00:07:39.550 --> 00:07:46.780
 always our blog was visited our 

00:07:42.940 --> 00:07:48.190
 facebook page and our channel 

00:07:46.780 --> 00:07:50.860
 Of course that's the most important thing 

00:07:48.190 --> 00:07:51.570
 and very nice if you are 

00:07:50.860 --> 00:07:54.610
 touting 

00:07:51.570 --> 00:07:58.110
 because we do not have any friends on 

00:07:54.610 --> 00:07:58.110
 every time until next time bye
