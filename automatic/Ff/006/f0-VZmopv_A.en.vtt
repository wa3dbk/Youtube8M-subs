00:03:03.370 --> 00:03:06.000 
let's let me come over here actually so
it<00:03:04.329> doesn't<00:03:04.599> matter<00:03:04.720> if<00:03:04.840> you're<00:03:05.290> night<00:03:05.560> or<00:03:05.829> day

00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:06.010 
it doesn't matter if you're night or day

00:03:06.010 --> 00:03:07.589 
it doesn't matter if you're night or day
or<00:03:06.310> anything<00:03:06.519> like<00:03:06.730> that<00:03:06.790> or<00:03:07.150> how<00:03:07.209> much<00:03:07.329> light

00:03:07.589 --> 00:03:07.599 
or anything like that or how much light

00:03:07.599 --> 00:03:09.599 
or anything like that or how much light
there<00:03:07.780> is<00:03:07.900> around<00:03:08.129> it<00:03:09.129> doesn't<00:03:09.280> matter<00:03:09.489> if

00:03:09.599 --> 00:03:09.609 
there is around it doesn't matter if

00:03:09.609 --> 00:03:19.250 
there is around it doesn't matter if
they're<00:03:09.760> lights<00:03:09.970> over<00:03:10.269> there<00:03:10.450> doesn't<00:03:10.930> matter

00:03:19.250 --> 00:03:19.260 

00:03:19.260 --> 00:03:21.860 

this<00:03:20.260> is<00:03:20.409> actually<00:03:20.709> pretty<00:03:20.890> awesome<00:03:21.010> yeah

00:03:21.860 --> 00:03:21.870 
this is actually pretty awesome yeah

00:03:21.870 --> 00:03:24.449 
this is actually pretty awesome yeah
exactly<00:03:22.870> my<00:03:23.530> handwriting

00:03:24.449 --> 00:03:24.459 
exactly my handwriting

00:03:24.459 --> 00:03:32.819 
exactly my handwriting
exactly<00:03:25.629> 100%<00:03:26.500> the<00:03:26.620> same<00:03:31.260> so<00:03:32.260> so<00:03:32.739> basically

00:03:32.819 --> 00:03:32.829 
exactly 100% the same so so basically

00:03:32.829 --> 00:03:35.610 
exactly 100% the same so so basically
the<00:03:33.730> sensors<00:03:34.150> are<00:03:34.359> here<00:03:34.720> and<00:03:34.900> they<00:03:35.260> detect

00:03:35.610 --> 00:03:35.620 
the sensors are here and they detect

00:03:35.620 --> 00:03:37.020 
the sensors are here and they detect
everything<00:03:35.980> that<00:03:36.220> happens<00:03:36.549> on<00:03:36.670> this<00:03:36.790> paper

00:03:37.020 --> 00:03:37.030 
everything that happens on this paper

00:03:37.030 --> 00:03:39.240 
everything that happens on this paper
yeah<00:03:37.450> as<00:03:37.720> long<00:03:37.989> as<00:03:38.139> the<00:03:38.260> paper<00:03:38.470> is<00:03:38.650> not<00:03:38.829> hiding

00:03:39.240 --> 00:03:39.250 
yeah as long as the paper is not hiding

00:03:39.250 --> 00:03:42.800 
yeah as long as the paper is not hiding
or<00:03:39.400> bubbling<00:03:39.700> or<00:03:40.060> anything<00:03:40.239> like<00:03:40.510> that<00:03:40.569> right

00:03:42.800 --> 00:03:42.810 
or bubbling or anything like that right

00:03:42.810 --> 00:03:45.690 
or bubbling or anything like that right
normal<00:03:43.810> paper<00:03:43.959> and<00:03:44.290> can<00:03:44.799> you<00:03:44.889> zoom<00:03:45.069> out<00:03:45.250> to<00:03:45.519> win

00:03:45.690 --> 00:03:45.700 
normal paper and can you zoom out to win

00:03:45.700 --> 00:03:53.670 
normal paper and can you zoom out to win
here<00:03:46.030> you<00:03:46.989> can<00:03:47.169> say<00:03:48.419> -<00:03:51.510> you<00:03:52.510> can<00:03:52.690> say<00:03:52.959> posturing

00:03:53.670 --> 00:03:53.680 
here you can say - you can say posturing

00:03:53.680 --> 00:03:56.550 
here you can say - you can say posturing
yeah

00:03:56.550 --> 00:03:56.560 

00:03:56.560 --> 00:04:05.560 

say<00:03:57.640> future<00:04:03.370> so<00:04:04.370> this<00:04:04.520> is<00:04:04.670> actually<00:04:05.030> a<00:04:05.060> serious

00:04:05.560 --> 00:04:05.570 
say future so this is actually a serious

00:04:05.570 --> 00:04:08.950 
say future so this is actually a serious
kind<00:04:05.810> of<00:04:05.960> like<00:04:06.790> concept<00:04:07.790> where<00:04:08.210> where<00:04:08.600> people

00:04:08.950 --> 00:04:08.960 
kind of like concept where where people

00:04:08.960 --> 00:04:10.960 
kind of like concept where where people
like<00:04:09.260> students<00:04:09.650> can<00:04:10.400> actually<00:04:10.730> take<00:04:10.940> notes

00:04:10.960 --> 00:04:10.970 
like students can actually take notes

00:04:10.970 --> 00:04:14.080 
like students can actually take notes
and<00:04:11.540> the<00:04:12.400> professionals<00:04:13.400> will<00:04:13.640> take<00:04:13.850> notes

00:04:14.080 --> 00:04:14.090 
and the professionals will take notes

00:04:14.090 --> 00:04:16.810 
and the professionals will take notes
and<00:04:14.590> basically<00:04:15.590> have<00:04:15.860> that<00:04:16.040> integrated

00:04:16.810 --> 00:04:16.820 
and basically have that integrated

00:04:16.820 --> 00:04:18.520 
and basically have that integrated
inside<00:04:17.180> of<00:04:17.269> Android<00:04:17.540> yeah<00:04:18.110> and<00:04:18.290> you<00:04:18.350> use<00:04:18.500> a

00:04:18.520 --> 00:04:18.530 
inside of Android yeah and you use a

00:04:18.530 --> 00:04:21.670 
inside of Android yeah and you use a
real<00:04:18.890> notepad<00:04:19.549> this<00:04:19.760> is<00:04:19.910> a<00:04:19.940> real<00:04:20.320> you<00:04:21.320> can<00:04:21.500> just

real notepad this is a real you can just

00:04:21.680 --> 00:04:24.790 
real notepad this is a real you can just
add<00:04:21.860> any<00:04:22.070> notepads<00:04:22.870> this<00:04:23.870> size<00:04:24.110> notepad<00:04:24.620> you

00:04:24.790 --> 00:04:24.800 
add any notepads this size notepad you

00:04:24.800 --> 00:04:26.800 
add any notepads this size notepad you
just<00:04:25.010> buy<00:04:25.160> new<00:04:25.370> ones<00:04:25.610> and<00:04:25.880> add<00:04:26.150> them<00:04:26.480> and<00:04:26.630> put

00:04:26.800 --> 00:04:26.810 
just buy new ones and add them and put

00:04:26.810 --> 00:04:29.740 
just buy new ones and add them and put
them<00:04:26.900> in<00:04:27.050> and<00:04:27.320> save<00:04:27.680> everything<00:04:28.010> online<00:04:28.750> what

00:04:29.740 --> 00:04:29.750 
them in and save everything online what

00:04:29.750 --> 00:04:31.260 
them in and save everything online what
are<00:04:29.870> you<00:04:29.990> planning<00:04:30.260> to<00:04:30.440> do<00:04:30.530> with<00:04:30.620> inodes

00:04:31.260 --> 00:04:31.270 
are you planning to do with inodes

00:04:31.270 --> 00:04:51.280 
are you planning to do with inodes
features<00:04:46.450> right<00:04:47.860> what's<00:04:48.860> a<00:04:48.950> wife<00:04:50.290> already

00:04:51.280 --> 00:04:51.290 
features right what's a wife already

00:04:51.290 --> 00:04:53.950 
features right what's a wife already
done<00:04:51.740> was<00:04:52.160> a<00:04:52.190> whiteboard<00:04:52.640> will<00:04:53.000> appear<00:04:53.510> on<00:04:53.690> the

00:04:53.950 --> 00:04:53.960 
done was a whiteboard will appear on the

00:04:53.960 --> 00:04:56.470 
done was a whiteboard will appear on the
screen<00:04:53.990> directly<00:04:54.760> so<00:04:55.760> they<00:04:55.910> don't<00:04:56.120> need<00:04:56.420> to

00:04:56.470 --> 00:04:56.480 
screen directly so they don't need to

00:04:56.480 --> 00:05:01.270 
screen directly so they don't need to
how<00:04:57.440> to<00:04:57.500> say<00:04:58.030> stand<00:04:59.030> from<00:04:59.900> after<00:05:00.440> death<00:05:00.650> in<00:05:01.130> the

00:05:01.270 --> 00:05:01.280 
how to say stand from after death in the

00:05:01.280 --> 00:05:03.940 
how to say stand from after death in the
same<00:05:01.460> something<00:05:01.870> people<00:05:02.870> we<00:05:03.170> understand<00:05:03.800> the

00:05:03.940 --> 00:05:03.950 
same something people we understand the

00:05:03.950 --> 00:05:06.320 
same something people we understand the
watermarks<00:05:04.640> they<00:05:04.850> are<00:05:04.940> talking<00:05:05.240> about

00:05:06.320 --> 00:05:06.330 
watermarks they are talking about

00:05:06.330 --> 00:05:08.719 
watermarks they are talking about
so<00:05:06.930> the<00:05:07.050> whiteboard<00:05:07.470> run<00:05:07.770> Android<00:05:08.190> and<00:05:08.550> this

00:05:08.719 --> 00:05:08.729 
so the whiteboard run Android and this

00:05:08.729 --> 00:05:17.570 
so the whiteboard run Android and this
one<00:05:08.909> were<00:05:09.030> in<00:05:09.120> the<00:05:09.210> Android<00:05:16.069> so<00:05:17.069> actually<00:05:17.460> this

00:05:17.570 --> 00:05:17.580 
one were in the Android so actually this

00:05:17.580 --> 00:05:19.399 
one were in the Android so actually this
technology<00:05:18.180> came<00:05:18.389> from<00:05:18.599> an<00:05:18.780> Israeli<00:05:19.020> company

00:05:19.399 --> 00:05:19.409 
technology came from an Israeli company

00:05:19.409 --> 00:05:27.279 
technology came from an Israeli company
yeah<00:05:20.190> and<00:05:21.500> now<00:05:22.500> it's<00:05:22.530> part<00:05:22.889> of<00:05:22.979> the<00:05:23.099> farm<00:05:23.340> yeah

00:05:27.279 --> 00:05:27.289 

00:05:27.289 --> 00:05:39.020 

all<00:05:28.289> right<00:05:29.629> available<00:05:30.629> the<00:05:30.720> solution<00:05:38.030> how

00:05:39.020 --> 00:05:39.030 
all right available the solution how

00:05:39.030 --> 00:05:41.059 
all right available the solution how
much<00:05:39.210> more<00:05:39.539> expensive<00:05:39.960> is<00:05:40.289> it<00:05:40.319> to<00:05:40.469> add<00:05:40.740> the

00:05:41.059 --> 00:05:41.069 
much more expensive is it to add the

00:05:41.069 --> 00:05:45.559 
much more expensive is it to add the
infrared<00:05:43.610> $40<00:05:44.610> more<00:05:44.879> you<00:05:45.120> get<00:05:45.300> the<00:05:45.419> whole

00:05:45.559 --> 00:05:45.569 
infrared $40 more you get the whole

00:05:45.569 --> 00:05:48.379 
infrared $40 more you get the whole
technology<00:05:45.840> yeah<00:05:46.349> cool<00:05:47.340> and<00:05:47.639> is<00:05:47.789> it<00:05:47.969> better<00:05:48.180> to

00:05:48.379 --> 00:05:48.389 
technology yeah cool and is it better to

00:05:48.389 --> 00:05:50.240 
technology yeah cool and is it better to
have<00:05:48.419> a<00:05:48.569> resistive<00:05:49.110> so<00:05:49.289> you<00:05:49.379> can<00:05:49.530> use<00:05:49.710> a<00:05:49.740> pen<00:05:50.009> on

00:05:50.240 --> 00:05:50.250 
have a resistive so you can use a pen on

00:05:50.250 --> 00:05:56.779 
have a resistive so you can use a pen on
the<00:05:50.400> screen<00:05:50.669> or<00:05:50.849> another<00:05:51.060> pen<00:05:51.300> or<00:05:51.539> stylus<00:05:55.789> to

00:05:56.779 --> 00:05:56.789 
the screen or another pen or stylus to

00:05:56.789 --> 00:05:58.580 
the screen or another pen or stylus to
you<00:05:56.879> know<00:05:57.000> on<00:05:57.240> a<00:05:57.270> finger<00:05:57.690> so<00:05:57.900> you<00:05:58.020> come<00:05:58.440> to

00:05:58.580 --> 00:05:58.590 
you know on a finger so you come to

00:05:58.590 --> 00:06:02.149 
you know on a finger so you come to
write<00:05:58.800> small<00:05:59.460> words<00:05:59.969> like<00:06:00.599> this<00:06:01.009> but<00:06:02.009> it's

00:06:02.149 --> 00:06:02.159 
write small words like this but it's

00:06:02.159 --> 00:06:04.879 
write small words like this but it's
better<00:06:02.340> with<00:06:02.610> a<00:06:02.639> stylus<00:06:03.240> on<00:06:03.509> a<00:06:03.780> resistive<00:06:04.469> and

00:06:04.879 --> 00:06:04.889 
better with a stylus on a resistive and

00:06:04.889 --> 00:06:06.589 
better with a stylus on a resistive and
actually<00:06:05.340> a<00:06:05.370> resistive<00:06:06.030> screen<00:06:06.300> is<00:06:06.449> better

00:06:06.589 --> 00:06:06.599 
actually a resistive screen is better

00:06:06.599 --> 00:06:09.260 
actually a resistive screen is better
port<00:06:06.960> status<00:06:07.229> as<00:06:07.530> well<00:06:07.680> yeah<00:06:08.069> yeah<00:06:08.219> so<00:06:09.000> if<00:06:09.210> you

00:06:09.260 --> 00:06:09.270 
port status as well yeah yeah so if you
