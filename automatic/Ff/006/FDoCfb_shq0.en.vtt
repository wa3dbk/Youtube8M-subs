00:00:11.059 --> 00:00:16.320
 hi guys I came back here the new radio from 

00:00:14.130 --> 00:00:19.080
 blog literature if I'm still with this 

00:00:16.320 --> 00:00:21.750
 little voice but I had to do 

00:00:19.080 --> 00:00:23.400
 this update because one year ago I 

00:00:21.750 --> 00:00:26.460
 I think since I posted the first 

00:00:23.400 --> 00:00:27.840
 video of that project of the rogue one of 

00:00:26.460 --> 00:00:29.519
 dilma girls 

00:00:27.840 --> 00:00:31.170
 So for those who do not know I'm going to leave. 

00:00:29.519 --> 00:00:33.690
 up here for you 

00:00:31.170 --> 00:00:35.820
 The video for you guys take a look at 

00:00:33.690 --> 00:00:37.829
 there finally know this project that is 

00:00:35.820 --> 00:00:39.450
 Wonderful is a project for life. 

00:00:37.829 --> 00:00:41.090
 whole would be goals and challenges. 

00:00:39.450 --> 00:00:44.610
 something like that then I preferred 

00:00:41.090 --> 00:00:46.590
 adhere to the project that gives I can at last 

00:00:44.610 --> 00:00:49.530
 extended for a lifetime because they are 

00:00:46.590 --> 00:00:51.660
 more than 300 books that rai 

00:00:49.530 --> 00:00:54.059
 euro throughout the holiday weekend quoted at last 

00:00:51.660 --> 00:00:55.980
 I want to read and now after a 

00:00:54.059 --> 00:00:59.399
 Year wants to show you what I read. 

00:00:55.980 --> 00:01:01.079
 Since then I've been surprised 

00:00:59.399 --> 00:01:04.530
 because I thought I would have gone too 

00:01:01.079 --> 00:01:05.939
 much less because that is how the 

00:01:04.530 --> 00:01:10.350
 project for a lifetime I'm not 

00:01:05.939 --> 00:01:11.460
 so worried about following him on foot 

00:01:10.350 --> 00:01:14.369
 of the letter 

00:01:11.460 --> 00:01:16.020
 so not when I get a beach read 

00:01:14.369 --> 00:01:18.450
 a book not to be imagined will be that 

00:01:16.020 --> 00:01:20.460
 he was on this list 

00:01:18.450 --> 00:01:22.860
 so much that it was only updating now that 

00:01:20.460 --> 00:01:24.509
 list and then I'll start to show 

00:01:22.860 --> 00:01:26.880
 To not stay very long time only 

00:01:24.509 --> 00:01:29.820
 not so much but here I really 

00:01:26.880 --> 00:01:32.280
 I thought I'd be much less there in the 

00:01:29.820 --> 00:01:33.750
 Finally if I've ever shown any excuse 

00:01:32.280 --> 00:01:36.479
 but I think I did not like it because I 

00:01:33.750 --> 00:01:38.430
 review the video is the first video where I 

00:01:36.479 --> 00:01:42.810
 I showed the books I had read 

00:01:38.430 --> 00:01:47.640
 I'll start with everything at 

00:01:42.810 --> 00:01:49.590
 people leave everything messy 1984 everything 

00:01:47.640 --> 00:01:51.840
 george orwell I know this list that 

00:01:49.590 --> 00:01:54.750
 I took my desire to read this 

00:01:51.840 --> 00:01:59.009
 book and I think last year 

00:01:54.750 --> 00:02:02.399
 I loved it, it's phenomenal, this book I love. 

00:01:59.009 --> 00:02:05.790
 dystopias and 10/4 dystopias that I more 

00:02:02.399 --> 00:02:07.340
 I like it so maybe this is the second one 

00:02:05.790 --> 00:02:09.979
 team's first on the seal 

00:02:07.340 --> 00:02:13.190
 I can define very well what is what I 

00:02:09.979 --> 00:02:16.489
 I like fahrenheit 451 

00:02:13.190 --> 00:02:18.980
 admirable new world and also orange 

00:02:16.489 --> 00:02:20.660
 mechanics and by the way I show them all 

00:02:18.980 --> 00:02:23.060
 Here for you now, then you go. 

00:02:20.660 --> 00:02:27.799
 I have already mentioned that it is the 

00:02:23.060 --> 00:02:31.489
 451 Fahrenheit orange ray bad boy 

00:02:27.799 --> 00:02:33.620
 mechanics of antony burks because you already 

00:02:31.489 --> 00:02:35.209
 saw someone talking about wars but anyway 

00:02:33.620 --> 00:02:37.010
 I do not know if this is how I pronounce it. 

00:02:35.209 --> 00:02:39.290
 I'll take a look to see if I'll say 

00:02:37.010 --> 00:02:42.200
 of elected after and brave new world 

00:02:39.290 --> 00:02:45.170
 aldous huxley it all three but 

00:02:42.200 --> 00:02:47.349
 I think - the brave new world 

00:02:45.170 --> 00:02:50.269
 was the first one I would say has no 

00:02:47.349 --> 00:02:52.910
 here on the rest channel has all the 

00:02:50.269 --> 00:02:54.440
 drawings and let's say the videos only 

00:02:52.910 --> 00:02:58.849
 about them 

00:02:54.440 --> 00:03:00.620
 I also read then it's time for anne 

00:02:58.849 --> 00:03:02.900
 frank 

00:03:00.620 --> 00:03:04.640
 some saw that one before doing the 

00:03:02.900 --> 00:03:07.549
 video I do not know why not show 

00:03:04.640 --> 00:03:10.190
 You in the green at last I loved this book. 

00:03:07.549 --> 00:03:12.799
 only he does not have a video about him yet 

00:03:10.190 --> 00:03:14.120
 Do you want to do the same thing in realengo? 

00:03:12.799 --> 00:03:17.510
 I intend to do it because it 's our 

00:03:14.120 --> 00:03:19.730
 head sure saw repair of iema 

00:03:17.510 --> 00:03:21.200
 han that which is my sweetheart the year 

00:03:19.730 --> 00:03:24.349
 I think it was the first one in my 

00:03:21.200 --> 00:03:26.989
 top 10 come this year 's passion book 

00:03:24.349 --> 00:03:28.670
 Passion he is incredible super recommend 

00:03:26.989 --> 00:03:29.780
 for those who love romance drama 

00:03:28.670 --> 00:03:31.970
 Second war 

00:03:29.780 --> 00:03:34.760
 is an excellent book for that also 

00:03:31.970 --> 00:03:39.769
 suicides of the day were the genes that 

00:03:34.760 --> 00:03:41.989
 a very striking book is an agonizing 

00:03:39.769 --> 00:03:44.630
 book well complicated so but I loved it 

00:03:41.989 --> 00:03:46.880
 I already read the video for him 

00:03:44.630 --> 00:03:48.169
 I'll leave the link below a book 

00:03:46.880 --> 00:03:50.359
 which I did not even comment on anyone 

00:03:48.169 --> 00:03:53.269
 I think it was about two years ago and 

00:03:50.359 --> 00:03:55.730
 mail more than the life of pi de yann martel 

00:03:53.269 --> 00:03:57.470
 who had left the film at the time was 

00:03:55.730 --> 00:04:01.099
 everybody talking about him and you want 

00:03:57.470 --> 00:04:03.470
 a copy to get curious environment 

00:04:01.099 --> 00:04:06.169
 I went there only and I did not do anything 

00:04:03.470 --> 00:04:09.109
 nothing of the blog neither here nor in the 

00:04:06.169 --> 00:04:11.419
 but it is a very interesting book and 

00:04:09.109 --> 00:04:12.650
 He captivated me like that at the time. 

00:04:11.419 --> 00:04:15.109
 I really liked it 

00:04:12.650 --> 00:04:18.299
 although we do not have him favorite 

00:04:15.109 --> 00:04:20.370
 he is very thought provoking so curious 

00:04:18.299 --> 00:04:21.629
 It tastes pretty good so I think 

00:04:20.370 --> 00:04:24.330
 captivates the reader 

00:04:21.629 --> 00:04:26.639
 Then I read the zoe tail and the snow white 

00:04:24.330 --> 00:04:29.190
 which are two points that is in this list 

00:04:26.639 --> 00:04:32.520
 of the rhyme and that has here in this edition 

00:04:29.190 --> 00:04:34.169
 zinha na I have not read all the short stories 

00:04:32.520 --> 00:04:35.159
 this book but I want to do it in 

00:04:34.169 --> 00:04:37.440
 brief 

00:04:35.159 --> 00:04:39.360
 and also the hotel you have here 

00:04:37.440 --> 00:04:40.949
 edict that has the tragedies of 

00:04:39.360 --> 00:04:42.599
 chip 

00:04:40.949 --> 00:04:45.780
 You'll give it to you, but you have to. 

00:04:42.599 --> 00:04:47.550
 eat julieta macbeth otelo i've read 

00:04:45.780 --> 00:04:49.530
 romeu and julieta and a screen is missing 

00:04:47.550 --> 00:04:51.330
 The second I still intend is with 

00:04:49.530 --> 00:04:53.729
 sure I want to see if I reread romeu 

00:04:51.330 --> 00:04:55.919
 and Juliet and the hotel because it's been years 

00:04:53.729 --> 00:04:57.919
 back then I do not remember very well remember 

00:04:55.919 --> 00:05:00.479
 just by itself is not what people really 

00:04:57.919 --> 00:05:02.400
 Remember when we are a long time. 

00:05:00.479 --> 00:05:04.229
 finally now nonexistent you know 

00:05:02.400 --> 00:05:06.810

00:05:04.229 --> 00:05:08.580

00:05:06.810 --> 00:05:11.819

00:05:14.639 --> 00:05:19.379
 Well cool, let 's leave the link there. 

00:05:16.979 --> 00:05:21.270
 and this book is very beautiful indeed. 

00:05:19.379 --> 00:05:24.060
 It's really different from anything you've ever 

00:05:21.270 --> 00:05:25.409
 I had read up to then and recently in 

00:05:24.060 --> 00:05:28.349
 Reading Macunaíma I remembered a lot 

00:05:25.409 --> 00:05:29.969
 this book is very funny to put an end to 

00:05:28.349 --> 00:05:32.310
 show two books to you that 

00:05:29.969 --> 00:05:34.139
 I finished now , I do not remember 

00:05:32.310 --> 00:05:35.969
 really are on this list either 

00:05:34.139 --> 00:05:37.860
 I already saw that list but I did not 

00:05:35.969 --> 00:05:40.169
 I know if this is the one I'm following today. 

00:05:37.860 --> 00:05:41.909
 but I'll show anyway if we 

00:05:40.169 --> 00:05:43.740
 We do not have the people will forgive me 

00:05:41.909 --> 00:05:46.759
 leave a note here in the video if you do not 

00:05:43.740 --> 00:05:49.560
 have that is the robot of isaac asimov 

00:05:46.759 --> 00:05:53.699
 amazing to see if this compiled 

00:05:49.560 --> 00:05:55.650
 get the one with marvelous johnson 

00:05:53.699 --> 00:05:57.779
 Really tip for those who like 

00:05:55.650 --> 00:06:01.229

00:05:57.779 --> 00:06:03.659

00:06:03.659 --> 00:06:09.210
 super classic there is almost certain that 

00:06:05.729 --> 00:06:12.090
 is on this list and in this great 

00:06:09.210 --> 00:06:14.460
 so look at those were the books 

00:06:12.090 --> 00:06:16.979
 I've read since then how do you 

00:06:14.460 --> 00:06:18.870
 can see are not so many if 

00:06:16.979 --> 00:06:20.819
 compared to more than 300 books that 

00:06:18.870 --> 00:06:22.919
 have this list but still I 

00:06:20.819 --> 00:06:24.449
 I liked the result and I now 

00:06:22.919 --> 00:06:27.659
 I'm in college, I'm going more 

00:06:24.449 --> 00:06:28.800

 I do not know if I can do it, let's see. 

00:06:31.160 --> 00:06:35.120
