gaps there there are some caps open but
this<00:02:54.120> is<00:02:54.269> the<00:02:54.450> idea<00:02:55.200> that<00:02:55.260> no<00:02:55.650> any<00:02:55.980> service<00:02:56.910> is

this is the idea that no any service is

00:02:57.060 --> 00:03:00.500 
this is the idea that no any service is
needed<00:02:57.450> and<00:02:58.019> then<00:02:58.860> then<00:02:59.459> we<00:02:59.670> look<00:02:59.910> in<00:03:00.239> there

inside<00:03:01.019> and<00:03:01.319> this<00:03:02.040> is<00:03:02.280> interesting<00:03:02.989> because

00:03:03.979 --> 00:03:03.989 
inside and this is interesting because

00:03:03.989 --> 00:03:06.580 
inside and this is interesting because
when<00:03:04.319> we<00:03:04.530> look<00:03:04.769> in<00:03:05.069> that<00:03:05.250> inside<00:03:05.760> area

00:03:06.580 --> 00:03:06.590 
when we look in that inside area

00:03:06.590 --> 00:03:12.410 
when we look in that inside area
normally<00:03:07.760> there<00:03:08.760> is<00:03:08.940> this<00:03:09.620> AK<00:03:10.620> as<00:03:10.950> it<00:03:11.430> is<00:03:11.640> this
