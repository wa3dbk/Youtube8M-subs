00:00:00.290 --> 00:00:04.950
 Hello everyone, so the situation is in the car 

00:00:03.570 --> 00:00:08.099
 some rattle 

00:00:04.950 --> 00:00:11.660
 what's there low-lying work and starts 

00:00:08.099 --> 00:00:14.790
 burn more slowly and more here 

00:00:11.660 --> 00:00:18.210
 so now i'm like my car 

00:00:14.790 --> 00:00:22.830
 tell you what could be the reasons so 1 

00:00:18.210 --> 00:00:24.779
 look good is it stable on 

00:00:22.830 --> 00:00:27.599
 may just take nature for something 

00:00:24.779 --> 00:00:33.630
 adjacent grating for example showers 

00:00:27.599 --> 00:00:38.460
 the stone is there are 2 no there 

00:00:33.630 --> 00:00:45.420
 problems bearing here what to see there 

00:00:38.460 --> 00:00:48.960
 just from the drum drum drum and this is a step 

00:00:45.420 --> 00:00:51.379
 or while these are different things you don’t want 

00:00:48.960 --> 00:00:54.840
 remove the top cover or back cover 

00:00:51.379 --> 00:00:59.030
 nothing complicated there are two cogs behind 

00:00:54.840 --> 00:01:04.500
 fillet back cover show how to remove 

00:00:59.030 --> 00:01:06.270
 we press the tank itself 

00:01:04.500 --> 00:01:08.670
 buck-tick for example arm or back 

00:01:06.270 --> 00:01:10.909
 press to feel and try 

00:01:08.670 --> 00:01:13.350
 to shake 

00:01:10.909 --> 00:01:18.960
 we will suddenly turn you 

00:01:13.350 --> 00:01:21.299
 if there is a chat independently and wine and two 

00:01:18.960 --> 00:01:22.619
 glasses for example hold and vice versa 

00:01:21.299 --> 00:01:25.170
 like by itself 

00:01:22.619 --> 00:01:29.150
 it means you have to climb the bearings or 

00:01:25.170 --> 00:01:34.140
 flanges there is a big cartoon drum analysis 

00:01:29.150 --> 00:01:35.659
 disassembly looks the drum actually like 

00:01:34.140 --> 00:01:39.689
 me with you expensive repair 

00:01:35.659 --> 00:01:42.570
 but very often everyones rattle and caused 

00:01:39.689 --> 00:01:45.890
 the fact that it is located before the browning of the body 

00:01:42.570 --> 00:01:45.890
 what it is 

00:01:45.910 --> 00:01:52.460
 can often be different under these 

00:01:49.850 --> 00:01:56.150
 cups for women 

00:01:52.460 --> 00:01:57.740
 metal era flyers liza 

00:01:56.150 --> 00:02:01.970
 holes, respectively, small 

00:01:57.740 --> 00:02:04.130
 get exactly where not usually or not 

00:02:01.970 --> 00:02:18.170
 here for gum 

00:02:04.130 --> 00:02:23.230
 between the rubber on the metal I'm not 

00:02:18.170 --> 00:02:29.780
 I will turn over I already took it off 

00:02:23.230 --> 00:02:32.360
 which is clamped take out view 

00:02:29.780 --> 00:02:34.910
 Is there a subject in it and we look 

00:02:32.360 --> 00:02:36.470
 pages- drums and some object there 

00:02:34.910 --> 00:02:39.860
 which might get stuck and 

00:02:36.470 --> 00:02:42.650
 catch for nothing by the way there is such a ball 

00:02:39.860 --> 00:02:44.120
 if you find do not get scared from the island 

00:02:42.650 --> 00:02:46.280
 with sculpted organisms he must 

00:02:44.120 --> 00:02:49.459
 blocks the output when the pump is not 

00:02:46.280 --> 00:02:51.489
 working it shouldn't be looked 

00:02:49.459 --> 00:02:54.500
 let's say there is nothing 

00:02:51.489 --> 00:02:57.410
 when the next moment where very often 

00:02:54.500 --> 00:02:59.330
 seduce foreign objects grandfather he could 

00:02:57.410 --> 00:03:09.860
 they can get stuck very easily and exactly 

00:02:59.330 --> 00:03:11.510
 not low so here's the back cover 

00:03:09.860 --> 00:03:14.000
 washing machines in some models 

00:03:11.510 --> 00:03:16.910
 the front cover is removed it just 

00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:18.830
 several screws and saw this 

00:03:16.910 --> 00:03:21.670
 lid with you nothing complicated there 

00:03:18.830 --> 00:03:25.240
 in this case, even will not show 

00:03:21.670 --> 00:03:29.410
 and so here there is a nest this already 

00:03:25.240 --> 00:03:31.690
 change of the tenten 

00:03:29.410 --> 00:03:35.200
 by the way in good condition by the way so that 

00:03:31.690 --> 00:03:38.500
 he was not covered by bloom 

00:03:35.200 --> 00:03:42.459
 calgon and in life I do not use time 

00:03:38.500 --> 00:03:46.000
 half a year 100 grams a pack of citric acid 

00:03:42.459 --> 00:03:48.420
 dissolve only transfer it to score in 

00:03:46.000 --> 00:03:51.310
 versions for washing powder and 

00:03:48.420 --> 00:03:53.800
 60 degrees are not necessary 

00:03:51.310 --> 00:03:57.250
 exceptions and everything dissolves it does not 

00:03:53.800 --> 00:04:00.430
 changed here even once he usually here 

00:03:57.250 --> 00:04:04.980
 inserted state like this even deeper 

00:04:00.430 --> 00:04:04.980
 gum here is a nest 

00:04:07.920 --> 00:04:12.910
 here they are separately usually 

00:04:10.180 --> 00:04:17.440
 removed immediately but I to show you 

00:04:12.910 --> 00:04:19.299
 took out the temperature sensor she's exactly 

00:04:17.440 --> 00:04:22.030
 here it’s just generally included but 

00:04:19.299 --> 00:04:24.790
 sometimes if it stops warming it changes 

00:04:22.030 --> 00:04:27.250
 this sensor itself that there might be 

00:04:24.790 --> 00:04:29.470
 the worker attached two wiring and in 

00:04:27.250 --> 00:04:31.990
 the outlet on very briefly pulled out 

00:04:29.470 --> 00:04:34.270
 tried to warm and the machine does not warm 

00:04:31.990 --> 00:04:36.360
 it can break this sensor here 

00:04:34.270 --> 00:04:39.520
 relevant contacts are shooting 

00:04:36.360 --> 00:04:42.729
 if they are all the same here 

00:04:39.520 --> 00:04:44.919
 for example you can see the ground here this 

00:04:42.729 --> 00:04:47.500
 plus and minus roles didn't play like you didn't 

00:04:44.919 --> 00:04:50.229
 put a separate contact on the sensor but 

00:04:47.500 --> 00:04:52.240
 if you mean they mean so 

00:04:50.229 --> 00:04:55.539
 remember where you can stick 

00:04:52.240 --> 00:04:58.330
 fasten yourself the ideal was to photograph 

00:04:55.539 --> 00:05:01.140
 before them night and it all took off 

00:04:58.330 --> 00:05:03.910
 and a screwdriver for a little bit yes 

00:05:01.140 --> 00:05:05.800
 nut loosened and screwdriver 

00:05:03.910 --> 00:05:09.270
 just a little bit just take out 

00:05:05.800 --> 00:05:12.820
 pliers on a bit pulled out 

00:05:09.270 --> 00:05:15.430
 drawn out they drop in there already 

00:05:12.820 --> 00:05:18.689
 inside of us the topic I would take off warned 

00:05:15.430 --> 00:05:21.419
 one more thing what could be there 

00:05:18.689 --> 00:05:24.449
 This is such a figurative delay. 

00:05:21.419 --> 00:05:27.209
 procrastination so here it is there 

00:05:24.449 --> 00:05:29.909
 inside the inside of this passes to there 

00:05:27.209 --> 00:05:33.029
 not bullied but it just fixes not 

00:05:29.909 --> 00:05:35.759
 scare it don't build often you can 

00:05:33.029 --> 00:05:39.059
 take out some piece of iron from there 

00:05:35.759 --> 00:05:41.249
 some noise in the guests can even 

00:05:39.059 --> 00:05:43.799
 come across from friends here 

00:05:41.249 --> 00:05:46.610
 anything happens and very often these are these 

00:05:43.799 --> 00:05:48.749
 bets from bras are taken out 

00:05:46.610 --> 00:05:50.899
 all is inserted back back all 

00:05:48.749 --> 00:05:54.269
 joins properly clamped and 

00:05:50.899 --> 00:05:55.800
 works further in this case 

00:05:54.269 --> 00:05:59.729
 the reason was different 

00:05:55.800 --> 00:06:02.069
 Now I will show you some cases 

00:05:59.729 --> 00:06:04.309
 the reason was no other 

00:06:02.069 --> 00:06:07.769
 no foreign objects were found 

00:06:04.309 --> 00:06:10.409
 shoto bearings i do n't feel separate 

00:06:07.769 --> 00:06:13.289
 Drum here if you look very 

00:06:10.409 --> 00:06:16.379
 the hotel goes very tightly 

00:06:13.289 --> 00:06:17.239
 walking zombak means what 

00:06:16.379 --> 00:06:20.610
 cause 

00:06:17.239 --> 00:06:22.469
 need to look not removed or position 

00:06:20.610 --> 00:06:25.229
 maybe somewhere caught stuck 

00:06:22.469 --> 00:06:28.019
 the weapons in my spring are in place only 

00:06:25.229 --> 00:06:31.309
 exhausted and the bottom there are two canada two 

00:06:28.019 --> 00:06:34.289
 such shock absorbers such as 

00:06:31.309 --> 00:06:36.979
 trunk relations open 

00:06:34.289 --> 00:06:39.839
 shock absorbers are far more powerful 

00:06:36.979 --> 00:06:42.389
 In general, the first models of the old relay are visible 

00:06:39.839 --> 00:06:43.739
 as we are very thin kamenyuka ran 

00:06:42.389 --> 00:06:46.169
 on 3 gravestone 

00:06:43.739 --> 00:06:48.959
 accordingly she could not fail 

00:06:46.169 --> 00:06:50.819
 somehow then appropriately 

00:06:48.959 --> 00:06:53.129
 reduce shine size because it 

00:06:50.819 --> 00:06:56.639
 there were heavy cars that are yours 

00:06:53.129 --> 00:06:58.129
 or moved made a small stone on 

00:06:56.639 --> 00:07:00.860
 spring 

00:06:58.129 --> 00:07:04.709
 But if these shock absorbers already know 

00:07:00.860 --> 00:07:05.339
 It turns out a shot and when it turns for 

00:07:04.709 --> 00:07:08.579
 sofa 

00:07:05.339 --> 00:07:11.399
 during these various shatov clings to 

00:07:08.579 --> 00:07:14.749
 the back door of the underlying claim lies 

00:07:11.399 --> 00:07:17.519
 because the couple remember the bottom looked 

00:07:14.749 --> 00:07:19.739
 neat neat through hole 

00:07:17.519 --> 00:07:23.010
 the shade there is very visible if 

00:07:19.739 --> 00:07:26.230
 flashlight shone what no scratches 

00:07:23.010 --> 00:07:28.870
 so here's another one maybe 

00:07:26.230 --> 00:07:33.600
 if he is such a strong step of the park itself 

00:07:28.870 --> 00:07:36.639
 while they are separate drum means this what 

00:07:33.600 --> 00:07:40.710
 most likely to change the flavor 

00:07:36.639 --> 00:07:43.570
 or if the questions are not the same 

00:07:40.710 --> 00:07:46.360
 this situation is the main reasons for you 

00:07:43.570 --> 00:07:48.580
 told after you of course below him 

00:07:46.360 --> 00:07:52.440
 wash but as you can see from the complicated here 

00:07:48.580 --> 00:08:06.040
 also not the biggest there was a 

00:07:52.440 --> 00:08:10.210
 and if you go to the repair of houses Ukraine 

00:08:06.040 --> 00:08:16.060
 what is now huge and by 

00:08:10.210 --> 00:08:20.340
 the discretion of the master that you will know 

00:08:16.060 --> 00:08:20.340
 tastes we get everything for now
