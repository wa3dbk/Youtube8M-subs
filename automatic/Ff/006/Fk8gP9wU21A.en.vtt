just my zoom pedals out in front man and

00:02:52.920 --> 00:02:55.160 
just my zoom pedals out in front man and
it's<00:02:53.040> like<00:02:53.190> the<00:02:53.520> B<00:02:53.700> the<00:02:54.330> B<00:02:54.480> nine<00:02:54.720> I<00:02:54.750> think<00:02:55.080> it's

00:02:55.160 --> 00:02:55.170 
it's like the B the B nine I think it's

00:02:55.170 --> 00:02:57.140 
it's like the B the B nine I think it's
the<00:02:55.230> newer<00:02:55.410> one<00:02:55.650> yeah<00:02:56.070> I<00:02:56.310> programmed<00:02:56.940> like

00:02:57.140 --> 00:02:57.150 
the newer one yeah I programmed like

00:02:57.150 --> 00:02:58.910 
the newer one yeah I programmed like
twenty<00:02:57.450> patches<00:02:57.840> into<00:02:57.989> it<00:02:58.140> for<00:02:58.290> the<00:02:58.380> company<00:02:58.739> I

00:02:58.910 --> 00:02:58.920 
twenty patches into it for the company I

00:02:58.920 --> 00:03:00.500 
twenty patches into it for the company I
still<00:02:59.489> don't<00:02:59.640> even<00:02:59.670> know<00:02:59.820> the<00:02:59.940> name<00:03:00.090> I<00:03:00.120> forget

00:03:00.500 --> 00:03:00.510 
still don't even know the name I forget

00:03:00.510 --> 00:03:02.330 
still don't even know the name I forget
it's<00:03:00.690> benign<00:03:01.080> I<00:03:01.140> think<00:03:01.530> I<00:03:01.680> hope<00:03:01.860> it's<00:03:02.040> benign

00:03:02.330 --> 00:03:02.340 
it's benign I think I hope it's benign

00:03:02.340 --> 00:03:03.890 
it's benign I think I hope it's benign
because<00:03:02.940> that's<00:03:03.150> that's<00:03:03.360> the<00:03:03.540> good<00:03:03.630> one<00:03:03.780> right

00:03:03.890 --> 00:03:03.900 
because that's that's the good one right

00:03:03.900 --> 00:03:06.320 
because that's that's the good one right
I<00:03:04.110> think<00:03:04.350> so<00:03:04.590> nine<00:03:04.860> is<00:03:05.070> good<00:03:05.250> if<00:03:06.090> you<00:03:06.239> have

00:03:06.320 --> 00:03:06.330 
I think so nine is good if you have

00:03:06.330 --> 00:03:07.580 
I think so nine is good if you have
something<00:03:06.630> come<00:03:06.750> back<00:03:06.870> benign<00:03:07.170> it's<00:03:07.410> good

00:03:07.580 --> 00:03:07.590 
something come back benign it's good

00:03:07.590 --> 00:03:09.410 
something come back benign it's good
right<00:03:07.830> that's<00:03:08.489> what<00:03:08.670> I'm<00:03:08.760> saying<00:03:09.000> so<00:03:09.150> I<00:03:09.270> think

00:03:09.410 --> 00:03:09.420 
right that's what I'm saying so I think

00:03:09.420 --> 00:03:12.890 
right that's what I'm saying so I think
it's<00:03:09.630> a<00:03:09.690> benign<00:03:10.019> I<00:03:10.080> believe<00:03:10.440> it<00:03:10.530> is<00:03:11.780> see<00:03:12.780> what

00:03:12.890 --> 00:03:12.900 
it's a benign I believe it is see what

00:03:12.900 --> 00:03:14.320 
it's a benign I believe it is see what
I'm<00:03:12.989> saying

00:03:14.320 --> 00:03:14.330 
I'm saying

00:03:14.330 --> 00:03:17.150 
I'm saying
but<00:03:15.330> uh<00:03:15.360> but<00:03:15.810> yeah<00:03:15.989> so<00:03:16.230> that's<00:03:16.530> basically<00:03:16.620> it<00:03:17.130> I

00:03:17.150 --> 00:03:17.160 
but uh but yeah so that's basically it I

00:03:26.750 --> 00:03:26.760 
the regular guy and so I used the

00:03:26.760 --> 00:03:29.330 
the regular guy and so I used the
regular<00:03:26.940> one<00:03:27.269> on<00:03:27.450> you<00:03:28.049> know<00:03:28.170> for<00:03:28.830> most<00:03:29.010> of<00:03:29.220> it
