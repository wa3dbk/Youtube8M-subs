00:00:07.370 --> 00:00:12.240
 saulo wanted the separation here and how 

00:00:10.260 --> 00:00:13.650
 process that will set up a 

00:00:12.240 --> 00:00:17.430
 component on the board after we 

00:00:13.650 --> 00:00:19.770
 already have the pcb ready where you want the 

00:00:17.430 --> 00:00:22.920
 board should receive the printed circuit board 

00:00:19.770 --> 00:00:26.250
 Are you going to need to put folder with the 

00:00:22.920 --> 00:00:28.050
 solder paste smiled on the plate as 

00:00:26.250 --> 00:00:30.570
 you do that the process can be manual 

00:00:28.050 --> 00:00:33.149
 point to point but this demands a lot 

00:00:30.570 --> 00:00:35.610
 time then what you can use if 

00:00:33.149 --> 00:00:37.890
 used as if it were a serigraphy that 

00:00:35.610 --> 00:00:41.010
 use a prison we call time 

00:00:37.890 --> 00:00:44.070
 all of it perforated laser cut 

00:00:41.010 --> 00:00:46.800
 this plate is well stretched through this 

00:00:44.070 --> 00:00:48.809
 the more stretched brake better than 

00:00:46.800 --> 00:00:50.309
 you may have problems after the folder 

00:00:48.809 --> 00:00:52.110
 when are we talking about 

00:00:50.309 --> 00:00:54.059
 very small components can take into account 

00:00:52.110 --> 00:00:56.610
 course between them 

00:00:54.059 --> 00:00:59.820
 after you have an extensive how and if 

00:00:56.610 --> 00:01:02.280
 cut the way you need it 

00:00:59.820 --> 00:01:04.979
 coincides with the card you will 

00:01:02.280 --> 00:01:08.340
 put the time for branches to the folder 

00:01:04.979 --> 00:01:10.590
 solder and then with a point like that you 

00:01:08.340 --> 00:01:12.450
 may be the manual process that 

00:01:10.590 --> 00:01:15.060
 is filling the board 

00:01:12.450 --> 00:01:17.909
 every time you paw the paste it 

00:01:15.060 --> 00:01:19.200
 deposits the top of the board and when you 

00:01:17.909 --> 00:01:21.720
 strip or stretch 

00:01:19.200 --> 00:01:24.270
 you already have your board painted the process 

00:01:21.720 --> 00:01:26.100
 to remove the stent is a very 

00:01:24.270 --> 00:01:27.320
 accurate is also why you do it 

00:01:26.100 --> 00:01:29.579
 manual form 

00:01:27.320 --> 00:01:31.290
 do not need size points 

00:01:29.579 --> 00:01:33.329
 A sad company, I do not forget the plague. 

00:01:31.290 --> 00:01:33.840
 which has some guaranteed way of doing 

00:01:33.329 --> 00:01:36.840
 that 

00:01:33.840 --> 00:01:38.370
 the manual that can be done with certainty 

00:01:36.840 --> 00:01:40.980
 usually you have machines 

00:01:38.370 --> 00:01:43.470
 To do that , you have manual machines. 

00:01:40.980 --> 00:01:45.000
 in manual or automatic 

00:01:43.470 --> 00:01:47.490
 in our case we can demonstrate 

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:50.460
 this with an automatic machine 

00:01:47.490 --> 00:01:53.340
 it is he who does the whole process she puts 

00:01:50.460 --> 00:01:55.320
 Your take takes photos to see if 

00:01:53.340 --> 00:01:57.510
 she is in the right position because she 

00:01:55.320 --> 00:01:59.730
 You also have to marry the plate. 

00:01:57.510 --> 00:02:02.250
 under foot and then there she goes 

00:01:59.730 --> 00:02:04.800
 automatically make this world and 

00:02:02.250 --> 00:02:06.270
 have the board and in the manual process 

00:02:04.800 --> 00:02:08.760
 machine helps you to have 

00:02:06.270 --> 00:02:11.850
 accuracy in carrying out a process 

00:02:08.760 --> 00:02:15.090
 manual would be like one of a 

00:02:11.850 --> 00:02:17.070
 shape and it rises from this plate is 

00:02:15.090 --> 00:02:19.680
 Of course we're talking about da 

00:02:17.070 --> 00:02:21.300
 need to decrease a lot and a machine 

00:02:19.680 --> 00:02:24.120
 we can work with micro 

00:02:21.300 --> 00:02:26.480
 in an opera adding to you will have 

00:02:24.120 --> 00:02:28.980
 components there maybe less than 11 

00:02:26.480 --> 00:02:33.000
 millimeters or even a new component 

00:02:28.980 --> 00:02:35.310
 Most chat management are isolating time 

00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:36.480
 of the machine that makes the agenda of 

00:02:35.310 --> 00:02:38.230
 boards of champions 

00:02:36.480 --> 00:02:40.510
 It's good first time. 

00:02:38.230 --> 00:02:42.519
 I just want you to show it to me. 

00:02:40.510 --> 00:02:45.489
 people to duck printing machine 

00:02:42.519 --> 00:02:47.620
 welding how it works as we prove 

00:02:45.489 --> 00:02:50.260
 the principle of its operation 

00:02:47.620 --> 00:02:52.690
 Good afternoon guys with the idea that it's you. 

00:02:50.260 --> 00:02:55.599
 having a sense of how this 

00:02:52.690 --> 00:02:58.360
 lisa with that you need to have one 

00:02:55.599 --> 00:03:00.700
 already designed with all courses 

00:02:58.360 --> 00:03:03.069
 of correct positions that we make 

00:03:00.700 --> 00:03:04.090
 this time you put the plate on the 

00:03:03.069 --> 00:03:06.640
 machine 

00:03:04.090 --> 00:03:08.409
 it will have an extension inside it and the 

00:03:06.640 --> 00:03:10.599
 From this moment you will have two 

00:03:08.409 --> 00:03:13.090
 backgrounds one to push by step and another 

00:03:10.599 --> 00:03:14.200
 to pull out this solder paste and 

00:03:13.090 --> 00:03:16.090
 this solder paste 

00:03:14.200 --> 00:03:17.379
 it will have entrance of these holes that 

00:03:16.090 --> 00:03:19.690
 you have difference 

00:03:17.379 --> 00:03:21.519
 as she bore in the hole she 

00:03:19.690 --> 00:03:22.599
 will deposit where we will have a 

00:03:21.519 --> 00:03:24.579
 net contact 

00:03:22.599 --> 00:03:29.079
 after that match he will have mounted a 

00:03:24.579 --> 00:03:31.720
 interesting component and this machine 

00:03:29.079 --> 00:03:34.810
 it does all this process from the 

00:03:31.720 --> 00:03:36.609
 plate image on it it uses cameras 

00:03:34.810 --> 00:03:39.310
 go to position the extension 

00:03:36.609 --> 00:03:41.890
 in relation to the plate she has she moves of 

00:03:39.310 --> 00:03:43.239
 separately from each of these two 

00:03:41.890 --> 00:03:45.069
 to be able to operate is 

00:03:43.239 --> 00:03:46.450
 exactly what happens if people 

00:03:45.069 --> 00:03:48.819
 talking here about components of 

00:03:46.450 --> 00:03:49.540
 point three boys are very 

00:03:48.819 --> 00:03:52.329
 little 

00:03:49.540 --> 00:03:54.549
 imagine that her pad would be from the 

00:03:52.329 --> 00:03:56.709
 electrical contact is smaller still 

00:03:54.549 --> 00:03:58.150
 because you usually have two with one 

00:03:56.709 --> 00:03:59.590
 component you have two 

00:03:58.150 --> 00:04:00.849
 contacts 

00:03:59.590 --> 00:04:01.940
 So we 're talking about some 

00:04:00.849 --> 00:04:05.240
 thing 

00:04:01.940 --> 00:04:07.730
 The enemy is any movement that you 

00:04:05.240 --> 00:04:10.100
 Are you going to interfere in your speech? 

00:04:07.730 --> 00:04:12.230
 Pedro then stays on, she has two 

00:04:10.100 --> 00:04:14.450
 as if it were two computers two 

00:04:12.230 --> 00:04:15.830
 independent systems is one of them and 

00:04:14.450 --> 00:04:17.570
 plaque affixing 

00:04:15.830 --> 00:04:19.280
 When she gets there, she'll stop her. 

00:04:17.570 --> 00:04:20.830
 plate in that position and will not lead 

00:04:19.280 --> 00:04:23.780
 the movement 

00:04:20.830 --> 00:04:25.550
 after that you come with the census 

00:04:23.780 --> 00:04:26.900
 this center that is on top it goes 

00:04:25.550 --> 00:04:28.940
 take a photo 

00:04:26.900 --> 00:04:31.370
 everything we call cops 

00:04:28.940 --> 00:04:33.800
 are the same marks as the one we 

00:04:31.370 --> 00:04:35.570
 Train for this, we love everything. 

00:04:33.800 --> 00:04:37.400
 social 

00:04:35.570 --> 00:04:40.280
 from the moment it checks 

00:04:37.400 --> 00:04:43.340
 her line sustain him on the 

00:04:40.280 --> 00:04:45.740
 plate and after that there the existence 

00:04:43.340 --> 00:04:48.770
 she can pass on another guarantee of 

00:04:45.740 --> 00:04:51.620
 correct deposit of this folder the sun 

00:04:48.770 --> 00:04:55.280
 there is much interest to compel Saul to speak 

00:04:51.620 --> 00:04:57.530
 now the will to favorite and correct 

00:04:55.280 --> 00:04:59.750
 the sun who has an interest in this 

00:04:57.530 --> 00:05:01.310
 welding plate laying machine 

00:04:59.750 --> 00:05:04.280
 what is the procedure how the 

00:05:01.310 --> 00:05:07.340
 make someone who is in touch with you 

00:05:04.280 --> 00:05:10.250
 can enter without more common and Olympic 

00:05:07.340 --> 00:05:12.560
 damage they must have liked or connected with people 

00:05:10.250 --> 00:05:14.270
 will find by its history with life 

00:05:12.560 --> 00:05:17.360
 and then we have all the low 

00:05:14.270 --> 00:05:21.710
 representation of the macula can be 

00:05:17.360 --> 00:05:24.289
 surprised the market to the supposed 

00:05:21.710 --> 00:05:25.940
 miss many thanks for the legacy I 

00:05:24.289 --> 00:05:27.800
 I woke up, I was thank you for 

00:05:25.940 --> 00:05:29.150
 there is more of this video from the 

00:05:27.800 --> 00:05:31.400
 letter that all information 

00:05:29.150 --> 00:05:33.680
 respect of this company's equipment 

00:05:31.400 --> 00:05:35.810
 are in the video description if you 

00:05:33.680 --> 00:05:36.979
 liked short share dedicated this 

00:05:35.810 --> 00:05:41.560
 video for your friends 

00:05:36.979 --> 00:05:41.560
 thank you even more next video
