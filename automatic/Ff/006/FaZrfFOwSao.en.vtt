00:00:22.970 --> 00:00:22.980 
pressing the both medium buttons kind of

00:00:22.980 --> 00:00:25.310 
pressing the both medium buttons kind of
like<00:00:23.070> a<00:00:23.100> focus<00:00:23.490> attack<00:00:23.760> his<00:00:24.539> back<00:00:24.900> throw

00:00:25.310 --> 00:00:25.320 
like a focus attack his back throw

00:00:25.320 --> 00:00:27.980 
like a focus attack his back throw
distance<00:00:25.650> is<00:00:26.010> very<00:00:26.609> good<00:00:26.970> what<00:00:27.869> I've<00:00:27.960> noticed

00:00:27.980 --> 00:00:27.990 
distance is very good what I've noticed

00:00:27.990 --> 00:00:30.200 
distance is very good what I've noticed
about<00:00:28.289> this<00:00:28.590> is<00:00:28.830> it's<00:00:28.980> almost<00:00:29.369> half<00:00:29.730> screen<00:00:30.060> I

00:00:30.200 --> 00:00:30.210 
about this is it's almost half screen I

00:00:30.210 --> 00:00:32.749 
about this is it's almost half screen I
would<00:00:30.510> say<00:00:30.720> that<00:00:31.529> he<00:00:31.619> can<00:00:31.769> you<00:00:32.160> can<00:00:32.279> back<00:00:32.489> throw

00:00:32.749 --> 00:00:32.759 
would say that he can you can back throw

00:00:32.759 --> 00:00:34.069 
would say that he can you can back throw
people<00:00:32.940> so<00:00:33.180> that's<00:00:33.270> going<00:00:33.450> to<00:00:33.510> get<00:00:33.660> him<00:00:33.899> into

00:00:34.069 --> 00:00:34.079 
people so that's going to get him into

00:00:34.079 --> 00:00:36.350 
people so that's going to get him into
the<00:00:34.200> pressure<00:00:34.500> situations<00:00:35.309> very<00:00:35.579> quickly<00:00:35.969> on

00:00:36.350 --> 00:00:36.360 
the pressure situations very quickly on

00:00:36.360 --> 00:00:39.770 
the pressure situations very quickly on
top<00:00:37.140> of<00:00:37.170> that<00:00:37.440> it<00:00:37.770> can<00:00:38.129> be<00:00:38.250> used<00:00:38.579> as<00:00:38.730> a<00:00:38.820> combo<00:00:39.570> in

00:00:39.770 --> 00:00:39.780

00:00:42.799 --> 00:00:42.809 
dirt yes you can actually use this as

00:00:42.809 --> 00:00:45.680

part of a combo that is something that

00:00:45.690 --> 00:00:47.720 
part of a combo that is something that
is<00:00:45.840> awesome<00:00:46.050> as<00:00:46.500> something<00:00:46.829> that<00:00:46.860> is<00:00:47.010> seen

00:00:47.720 --> 00:00:47.730 
is awesome as something that is seen

00:00:47.730 --> 00:00:50.330 
is awesome as something that is seen
from<00:00:47.879> a<00:00:48.030> few<00:00:48.329> characters<00:00:48.899> in<00:00:49.129> street<00:00:50.129> fighter

00:00:50.330 --> 00:00:50.340 
from a few characters in street fighter

00:00:50.340 --> 00:00:53.299 
from a few characters in street fighter
5<00:00:50.520> so<00:00:50.789> far<00:00:51.030> now<00:00:51.930> this<00:00:52.379> is<00:00:52.590> where<00:00:52.739> things<00:00:53.010> get<00:00:53.250> a

00:00:53.299 --> 00:00:53.309 
5 so far now this is where things get a

00:00:53.309 --> 00:00:54.830 
5 so far now this is where things get a
little<00:00:53.520> ridiculous<00:00:53.789> for<00:00:54.300> a<00:00:54.329> character<00:00:54.809> that

00:00:54.830 --> 00:00:54.840 
little ridiculous for a character that

00:00:54.840 --> 00:00:57.290 
little ridiculous for a character that
looks<00:00:55.469> to<00:00:55.739> be<00:00:55.860> very<00:00:55.890> high<00:00:56.430> damage<00:00:56.730> he<00:00:57.030> has<00:00:57.059> a

00:00:57.290 --> 00:00:57.300 
looks to be very high damage he has a

00:00:57.300 --> 00:01:00.410 
looks to be very high damage he has a
dive<00:00:58.020> kick<00:00:58.530> he<00:00:59.370> actually<00:00:59.520> has<00:00:59.789> a<00:00:59.820> dive<00:01:00.120> kick

00:01:00.410 --> 00:01:00.420 
dive kick he actually has a dive kick

00:01:00.420 --> 00:01:02.360 
dive kick he actually has a dive kick
imagine<00:01:00.960> Zangief<00:01:01.440> with<00:01:01.680> a<00:01:01.710> dive<00:01:01.949> kick<00:01:02.190> we're

00:01:02.360 --> 00:01:02.370 
imagine Zangief with a dive kick we're

00:01:02.370 --> 00:01:03.560 
imagine Zangief with a dive kick we're
gonna<00:01:02.460> get<00:01:02.609> a<00:01:02.670> little<00:01:02.760> further<00:01:03.059> into<00:01:03.329> why<00:01:03.539> I

00:01:03.560 --> 00:01:03.570 
gonna get a little further into why I

00:01:03.570 --> 00:01:05.990 
gonna get a little further into why I
make<00:01:03.870> that<00:01:04.080> comparison<00:01:05.040> in<00:01:05.369> just<00:01:05.580> a<00:01:05.670> moment

00:01:05.990 --> 00:01:06.000 
make that comparison in just a moment

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:08.570 
make that comparison in just a moment
this<00:01:06.780> is<00:01:06.990> what<00:01:07.229> I<00:01:07.260> think<00:01:07.740> is<00:01:07.890> his<00:01:08.040> command

00:01:08.570 --> 00:01:08.580 
this is what I think is his command

00:01:08.580 --> 00:01:11.170 
this is what I think is his command
throw<00:01:08.850> it<00:01:09.060> looks<00:01:09.240> like<00:01:09.390> a<00:01:09.420> command<00:01:09.869> grab

00:01:11.170 --> 00:01:11.180 
throw it looks like a command grab

00:01:11.180 --> 00:01:13.370 
throw it looks like a command grab
probably<00:01:12.180> a<00:01:12.210> high<00:01:12.420> damage<00:01:12.659> maneuver<00:01:13.170> it<00:01:13.229> looks

00:01:13.370 --> 00:01:13.380 
probably a high damage maneuver it looks

00:01:13.380 --> 00:01:15.740 
probably a high damage maneuver it looks
a<00:01:13.500> lot<00:01:13.619> like<00:01:13.770> T<00:01:14.010> Hawks<00:01:14.299> command<00:01:15.299> throw<00:01:15.540> without

00:01:15.740 --> 00:01:15.750 
a lot like T Hawks command throw without

00:01:15.750 --> 00:01:18.910 
a lot like T Hawks command throw without
the<00:01:16.170> super<00:01:17.070> spin<00:01:17.400> that<00:01:17.610> he<00:01:17.729> does<00:01:17.909> you<00:01:18.509> know

00:01:18.910 --> 00:01:18.920 
the super spin that he does you know

00:01:18.920 --> 00:01:21.890 
the super spin that he does you know
twirling<00:01:19.920> you<00:01:20.009> around<00:01:20.040> and<00:01:20.580> then<00:01:21.240> he<00:01:21.720> goes

00:01:21.890 --> 00:01:21.900 
twirling you around and then he goes

00:01:21.900 --> 00:01:24.649 
twirling you around and then he goes
into<00:01:22.380> and<00:01:22.740> you<00:01:23.009> can<00:01:23.189> cancel<00:01:23.460> into<00:01:24.060> this<00:01:24.180> this

00:01:24.649 --> 00:01:24.659 
into and you can cancel into this this

00:01:24.659 --> 00:01:27.440 
into and you can cancel into this this
is<00:01:24.810> a<00:01:24.840> special<00:01:25.170> move<00:01:25.530> a<00:01:25.710> berserker<00:01:26.280> /<00:01:26.610> ish<00:01:27.000> move

00:01:27.440 --> 00:01:27.450 
is a special move a berserker / ish move

00:01:27.450 --> 00:01:28.940 
is a special move a berserker / ish move
I<00:01:27.630> don't<00:01:27.810> know<00:01:27.900> what<00:01:28.049> the<00:01:28.140> name<00:01:28.290> of<00:01:28.350> it<00:01:28.560> is<00:01:28.619> yet

00:01:28.940 --> 00:01:28.950 
I don't know what the name of it is yet

00:01:28.950 --> 00:01:30.890 
I don't know what the name of it is yet
but<00:01:28.979> it<00:01:29.549> definitely<00:01:29.790> looks<00:01:30.060> like<00:01:30.119> the<00:01:30.360> zurka<00:01:30.630> /

00:01:30.890 --> 00:01:30.900 
but it definitely looks like the zurka /

00:01:30.900 --> 00:01:32.510 
but it definitely looks like the zurka /

from Wolverine if you're not familiar
with<00:01:32.970> that<00:01:33.000> and<00:01:33.479> the<00:01:34.320> e<00:01:34.350> ex<00:01:34.740> command<00:01:35.310> grab<00:01:35.579> the

with that and the e ex command grab the

00:01:35.880 --> 00:01:38.780 
with that and the e ex command grab the
e<00:01:35.909> x<00:01:36.240> version<00:01:36.630> of<00:01:36.720> that<00:01:36.750> it<00:01:37.560> actually<00:01:37.860> ball

00:01:38.780 --> 00:01:38.790 
e x version of that it actually ball

00:01:38.790 --> 00:01:41.300 
e x version of that it actually ball
bounces<00:01:39.450> so<00:01:39.780> you<00:01:40.200> don't<00:01:40.409> only<00:01:40.650> get<00:01:40.890> the<00:01:41.009> damage

00:01:41.300 --> 00:01:41.310 
bounces so you don't only get the damage

00:01:41.310 --> 00:01:43.160 
bounces so you don't only get the damage
off<00:01:41.430> of<00:01:41.579> that<00:01:41.670> but<00:01:41.790> you<00:01:41.909> can<00:01:42.030> also<00:01:42.119> can<00:01:42.450> combo

00:01:43.160 --> 00:01:43.170 
off of that but you can also can combo

00:01:43.170 --> 00:01:46.670 
off of that but you can also can combo
after<00:01:43.649> it<00:01:44.030> into<00:01:45.030> his<00:01:45.240> uppercut<00:01:45.720> yes<00:01:46.140> he<00:01:46.409> has<00:01:46.649> a

00:01:46.670 --> 00:01:46.680 
after it into his uppercut yes he has a

00:01:46.680 --> 00:01:50.929 
after it into his uppercut yes he has a
sure<00:01:47.130> you<00:01:47.430> can<00:01:47.729> um<00:01:48.689> I<00:01:49.170> think<00:01:49.710> it's<00:01:50.430> three<00:01:50.729> hits

00:01:50.929 --> 00:01:50.939 
sure you can um I think it's three hits

00:01:50.939 --> 00:01:52.760 
sure you can um I think it's three hits
i<00:01:51.119> know<00:01:51.180> it's<00:01:51.450> three<00:01:51.659> hits<00:01:51.840> but<00:01:52.110> i<00:01:52.140> think<00:01:52.500> it's

00:01:52.760 --> 00:01:52.770 
i know it's three hits but i think it's

00:01:52.770 --> 00:01:54.590 
i know it's three hits but i think it's
fairly<00:01:53.100> fast<00:01:53.490> as<00:01:53.700> well<00:01:53.880> so<00:01:54.060> you<00:01:54.149> can<00:01:54.210> use<00:01:54.479> this

00:01:54.590 --> 00:01:54.600 
fairly fast as well so you can use this

00:01:54.600 --> 00:01:57.410 
fairly fast as well so you can use this
as<00:01:54.780> an<00:01:54.930> anti-air<00:01:55.530> let's<00:01:56.369> uh<00:01:56.610> I<00:01:56.939> want<00:01:57.180> to<00:01:57.240> take<00:01:57.390> a

as an anti-air let's uh I want to take a

00:01:57.420 --> 00:01:59.780 
as an anti-air let's uh I want to take a
little<00:01:57.630> look<00:01:57.869> at<00:01:57.990> this<00:01:58.170> real<00:01:58.469> quick<00:01:58.790> here

00:01:59.780 --> 00:01:59.790 
little look at this real quick here

00:01:59.790 --> 00:02:02.719 
little look at this real quick here
comes<00:02:00.000> the<00:02:00.090> EXP<00:02:01.159> comes<00:02:02.159> off<00:02:02.310> the<00:02:02.430> wall<00:02:02.610> and

00:02:02.719 --> 00:02:02.729 
comes the EXP comes off the wall and

00:02:02.729 --> 00:02:05.090 
comes the EXP comes off the wall and
there's<00:02:02.969> a<00:02:03.090> neutral<00:02:03.540> state<00:02:03.780> it<00:02:04.530> looks<00:02:04.860> like

00:02:05.090 --> 00:02:05.100 
there's a neutral state it looks like

00:02:05.100 --> 00:02:09.559 
there's a neutral state it looks like
maybe<00:02:06.079> maybe<00:02:07.079> a<00:02:07.259> few<00:02:07.860> frames<00:02:08.310> so<00:02:08.819> it<00:02:09.179> looks

00:02:09.559 --> 00:02:09.569 
maybe maybe a few frames so it looks

00:02:09.569 --> 00:02:11.540 
maybe maybe a few frames so it looks
like<00:02:09.810> it<00:02:09.959> has<00:02:10.050> incredibly<00:02:10.530> fast<00:02:10.860> startup<00:02:11.310> so

00:02:11.540 --> 00:02:11.550 
like it has incredibly fast startup so

00:02:11.550 --> 00:02:12.710 
like it has incredibly fast startup so
yes<00:02:11.790> I'm<00:02:11.970> going<00:02:12.060> to<00:02:12.180> say<00:02:12.360> that<00:02:12.540> this<00:02:12.660> is

00:02:12.710 --> 00:02:12.720 
yes I'm going to say that this is

00:02:12.720 --> 00:02:13.960 
yes I'm going to say that this is
probably<00:02:13.080> a<00:02:13.349> reliable

00:02:13.960 --> 00:02:13.970 
probably a reliable

00:02:13.970 --> 00:02:15.640 
probably a reliable
anti<00:02:14.360> air<00:02:14.540> I'm<00:02:15.200> going<00:02:15.320> to<00:02:15.410> say<00:02:15.530> that's

00:02:15.640 --> 00:02:15.650 
anti air I'm going to say that's

00:02:15.650 --> 00:02:19.960 
anti air I'm going to say that's
probably<00:02:15.920> as<00:02:16.190> fourth<00:02:16.580> row<00:02:17.170> just<00:02:18.640> just<00:02:19.640> to<00:02:19.790> say

00:02:19.960 --> 00:02:19.970 
probably as fourth row just just to say

00:02:19.970 --> 00:02:22.330 
probably as fourth row just just to say
this<00:02:20.450> is<00:02:20.780> V<00:02:20.990> counter<00:02:21.440> every<00:02:21.740> character<00:02:22.220> in<00:02:22.250> the

00:02:22.330 --> 00:02:22.340 
this is V counter every character in the

game has a V counter you just hold back
to<00:02:24.320> block<00:02:24.620> and<00:02:24.920> then<00:02:25.430> you<00:02:25.760> maybe<00:02:26.720> push<00:02:26.900> forward

00:02:27.280 --> 00:02:27.290 
to block and then you maybe push forward

00:02:27.290 --> 00:02:28.840 
to block and then you maybe push forward
and<00:02:27.440> three<00:02:27.530> punches<00:02:27.980> and<00:02:28.190> this<00:02:28.580> is<00:02:28.730> his

as<00:04:45.820> I've<00:04:45.970> seen<00:04:46.000> from<00:04:46.389> this<00:04:46.539> trailer<00:04:46.870> they

00:04:47.010 --> 00:04:47.020 
as I've seen from this trailer they

00:04:47.020 --> 00:04:48.570 
as I've seen from this trailer they
might<00:04:47.199> add<00:04:47.440> that<00:04:47.470> in<00:04:47.800> later<00:04:47.949> and<00:04:48.130> make<00:04:48.250> it<00:04:48.370> just

00:04:48.570 --> 00:04:48.580 
might add that in later and make it just

00:04:48.580 --> 00:04:50.850 
might add that in later and make it just
the<00:04:48.610> most<00:04:48.789> ridiculous<00:04:48.940> thing<00:04:49.509> ever<00:04:49.600> but<00:04:49.990> I'm

00:04:50.850 --> 00:04:50.860 
the most ridiculous thing ever but I'm

00:04:50.860 --> 00:04:53.850 
the most ridiculous thing ever but I'm
gonna<00:04:51.100> say<00:04:51.370> that<00:04:51.550> right<00:04:51.699> now<00:04:51.910> he<00:04:52.240> is<00:04:52.860> probably

00:04:53.850 --> 00:04:53.860 
gonna say that right now he is probably

00:04:53.860 --> 00:04:56.730 
gonna say that right now he is probably
a<00:04:53.949> bit<00:04:54.280> above<00:04:54.669> zangief<00:04:55.479> as<00:04:55.750> far<00:04:56.050> as<00:04:56.169> a<00:04:56.199> mix-up

00:04:56.730 --> 00:04:56.740 
a bit above zangief as far as a mix-up

00:04:56.740 --> 00:04:58.620 
a bit above zangief as far as a mix-up
character<00:04:57.220> he<00:04:57.729> probably<00:04:57.970> has<00:04:58.240> very<00:04:58.539> high

00:04:58.620 --> 00:04:58.630 
character he probably has very high

00:04:58.630 --> 00:05:01.560 
character he probably has very high
damage<00:04:58.960> and<00:04:59.289> also<00:04:59.710> his<00:04:59.949> v-trigger<00:05:00.400> seems<00:05:00.910> to

00:05:01.560 --> 00:05:01.570 
damage and also his v-trigger seems to

00:05:01.570 --> 00:05:05.640 
damage and also his v-trigger seems to
be<00:05:01.750> way<00:05:02.910> way<00:05:03.910> good<00:05:04.330> I<00:05:04.570> mean<00:05:04.780> just<00:05:04.810> a<00:05:05.110> completely

be way way good I mean just a completely
awesome<00:05:06.340> v-trigger<00:05:07.000> that<00:05:07.300> allows<00:05:07.539> him<00:05:07.570> new

00:05:08.490 --> 00:05:08.500 
awesome v-trigger that allows him new

00:05:08.500 --> 00:05:10.770 
awesome v-trigger that allows him new
properties<00:05:09.039> on<00:05:09.160> his<00:05:09.280> specials<00:05:09.729> it<00:05:09.940> allows<00:05:10.419> him

00:05:10.770 --> 00:05:10.780 
properties on his specials it allows him

00:05:10.780 --> 00:05:13.379 
properties on his specials it allows him
not<00:05:11.710> that<00:05:11.919> Ken<00:05:12.130> doesn't<00:05:12.370> and<00:05:12.699> a<00:05:13.060> few<00:05:13.240> other

00:05:13.379 --> 00:05:13.389 
not that Ken doesn't and a few other

00:05:13.389 --> 00:05:15.420 
not that Ken doesn't and a few other
people<00:05:13.660> don't<00:05:13.780> have<00:05:13.930> that<00:05:14.080> but<00:05:14.500> his<00:05:15.190> new

00:05:15.420 --> 00:05:15.430 
people don't have that but his new

00:05:15.430 --> 00:05:17.610 
people don't have that but his new
properties<00:05:15.940> seem<00:05:16.180> to<00:05:16.419> really<00:05:16.960> help<00:05:17.320> them<00:05:17.530> out

00:05:17.610 --> 00:05:17.620 
properties seem to really help them out

00:05:17.620 --> 00:05:20.730 
properties seem to really help them out
as<00:05:17.830> far<00:05:18.099> as<00:05:18.220> tacking<00:05:18.759> on<00:05:18.880> extra<00:05:19.479> damage<00:05:19.740> right

00:05:20.730 --> 00:05:20.740 
as far as tacking on extra damage right

00:05:20.740 --> 00:05:23.370 
as far as tacking on extra damage right
away<00:05:21.009> from<00:05:21.340> the<00:05:21.460> combos<00:05:21.960> standpoint<00:05:22.960> and<00:05:23.169> also

00:05:23.370 --> 00:05:23.380 
away from the combos standpoint and also

00:05:23.380 --> 00:05:26.909 
away from the combos standpoint and also
it<00:05:23.919> seems<00:05:24.250> that<00:05:24.550> there<00:05:25.479> are<00:05:25.750> just<00:05:26.080> overall<00:05:26.770> new

00:05:26.909 --> 00:05:26.919 
it seems that there are just overall new

00:05:26.919 --> 00:05:28.230 
it seems that there are just overall new
properties<00:05:27.370> that<00:05:27.550> make<00:05:27.699> it<00:05:27.820> so<00:05:27.970> that<00:05:28.060> new

00:05:28.230 --> 00:05:28.240 
properties that make it so that new

00:05:28.240 --> 00:05:30.089 
properties that make it so that new
combos<00:05:28.630> are<00:05:28.720> even<00:05:28.990> available<00:05:29.080> to<00:05:29.740> him<00:05:29.860> that

00:05:30.089 --> 00:05:30.099 
combos are even available to him that

00:05:30.099 --> 00:05:32.460 
combos are even available to him that
weren't<00:05:30.310> available<00:05:30.370> before<00:05:30.880> so<00:05:31.470> altogether

00:05:32.460 --> 00:05:32.470 
weren't available before so altogether

00:05:32.470 --> 00:05:34.050 
weren't available before so altogether
I'm<00:05:32.680> going<00:05:32.889> to<00:05:32.949> say<00:05:33.099> that<00:05:33.340> this<00:05:33.580> character

00:05:34.050 --> 00:05:34.060 
I'm going to say that this character

00:05:34.060 --> 00:05:37.260 
I'm going to say that this character
looks<00:05:34.360> amazing<00:05:35.110> on<00:05:35.940> personally<00:05:36.940> I<00:05:37.000> would<00:05:37.120> like

00:05:37.260 --> 00:05:37.270 
looks amazing on personally I would like

00:05:37.270 --> 00:05:39.450 
looks amazing on personally I would like
to<00:05:37.419> get<00:05:37.690> my<00:05:37.810> hands<00:05:38.050> on<00:05:38.260> on<00:05:38.680> just<00:05:38.979> a<00:05:39.130> playable

00:05:39.450 --> 00:05:39.460 
to get my hands on on just a playable

00:05:39.460 --> 00:05:41.399 
to get my hands on on just a playable
version<00:05:39.580> of<00:05:40.000> him<00:05:40.180> and<00:05:40.479> test<00:05:40.810> out<00:05:40.990> some<00:05:41.229> of<00:05:41.349> the

00:05:41.399 --> 00:05:41.409 
version of him and test out some of the

00:05:41.409 --> 00:05:43.680 
version of him and test out some of the
things<00:05:41.620> that<00:05:41.710> I'm<00:05:41.919> thinking<00:05:42.310> of<00:05:42.490> in<00:05:42.669> this<00:05:43.210> as

00:05:43.680 --> 00:05:43.690 
things that I'm thinking of in this as

00:05:43.690 --> 00:05:45.540 
things that I'm thinking of in this as
far<00:05:43.900> as<00:05:43.990> his<00:05:44.169> ground<00:05:44.500> pound<00:05:44.740> ability<00:05:45.190> as<00:05:45.310> far

00:05:45.540 --> 00:05:45.550 
far as his ground pound ability as far

00:05:45.550 --> 00:05:47.909 
far as his ground pound ability as far
as<00:05:45.699> the<00:05:45.820> damage<00:05:46.180> output<00:05:46.389> and<00:05:46.780> also<00:05:47.080> what<00:05:47.889> the

00:05:47.909 --> 00:05:47.919 
as the damage output and also what the

00:05:47.919 --> 00:05:49.770 
as the damage output and also what the
v-trigger<00:05:48.400> does<00:05:48.789> for<00:05:49.060> him<00:05:49.150> so<00:05:49.360> there<00:05:49.630> are<00:05:49.720> a

00:05:49.770 --> 00:05:49.780 
v-trigger does for him so there are a

00:05:49.780 --> 00:05:51.029 
v-trigger does for him so there are a
few<00:05:49.900> things<00:05:50.110> that<00:05:50.320> I'm<00:05:50.409> not<00:05:50.560> able<00:05:50.620> to

00:05:51.029 --> 00:05:51.039 
few things that I'm not able to

00:05:51.039 --> 00:05:53.939 
few things that I'm not able to
accurately<00:05:51.490> analyze<00:05:52.300> from<00:05:52.870> this<00:05:53.050> trailer<00:05:53.470> but

00:05:53.939 --> 00:05:53.949 
accurately analyze from this trailer but

00:05:53.949 --> 00:05:56.310 
accurately analyze from this trailer but
I'm<00:05:54.039> just<00:05:54.190> gonna<00:05:54.340> say<00:05:54.460> that<00:05:54.940> McCallie<00:05:55.900> looks

00:05:56.310 --> 00:05:56.320 
I'm just gonna say that McCallie looks

00:05:56.320 --> 00:05:59.339 
I'm just gonna say that McCallie looks
like<00:05:57.030> awesomeness<00:05:58.030> it<00:05:58.509> looks<00:05:58.750> like<00:05:59.020> something

00:05:59.339 --> 00:05:59.349 
like awesomeness it looks like something

00:05:59.349 --> 00:06:01.890 
like awesomeness it looks like something
that<00:05:59.620> is<00:05:59.740> going<00:05:59.919> to<00:06:00.130> be<00:06:00.300> way<00:06:01.300> overpowered

00:06:01.890 --> 00:06:01.900 
that is going to be way overpowered

00:06:01.900 --> 00:06:03.749 
that is going to be way overpowered
until<00:06:02.259> people<00:06:02.409> figure<00:06:03.190> out<00:06:03.310> the<00:06:03.520> way<00:06:03.639> around

00:06:03.749 --> 00:06:03.759 
until people figure out the way around

00:06:03.759 --> 00:06:06.089 
until people figure out the way around
it<00:06:04.210> and<00:06:04.389> it<00:06:05.169> looks<00:06:05.320> like<00:06:05.380> the<00:06:05.560> way<00:06:05.650> around<00:06:05.770> is

00:06:06.089 --> 00:06:06.099 
it and it looks like the way around is

00:06:06.099 --> 00:06:07.860 
it and it looks like the way around is
just<00:06:06.310> going<00:06:06.400> to<00:06:06.460> be<00:06:06.520> it<00:06:07.030> depends<00:06:07.419> on<00:06:07.509> how<00:06:07.659> high

00:06:07.860 --> 00:06:07.870 
just going to be it depends on how high

00:06:07.870 --> 00:06:09.659 
just going to be it depends on how high
that<00:06:07.900> ground<00:06:08.530> pound<00:06:08.830> really<00:06:09.159> hits<00:06:09.370> if<00:06:09.550> it

00:06:09.659 --> 00:06:09.669 
that ground pound really hits if it

00:06:09.669 --> 00:06:11.010 
that ground pound really hits if it
doesn't<00:06:09.940> hit<00:06:10.060> you<00:06:10.210> if<00:06:10.419> you're<00:06:10.539> not<00:06:10.750> on<00:06:10.930> the

00:06:11.010 --> 00:06:11.020 
doesn't hit you if you're not on the

00:06:11.020 --> 00:06:13.170 
doesn't hit you if you're not on the
ground<00:06:11.259> then<00:06:11.800> he<00:06:11.949> might<00:06:12.130> be<00:06:12.340> slightly<00:06:12.940> easier

00:06:13.170 --> 00:06:13.180 
ground then he might be slightly easier

00:06:13.180 --> 00:06:15.719 
ground then he might be slightly easier
to<00:06:13.509> counter<00:06:13.870> but<00:06:14.050> as<00:06:14.259> of<00:06:14.650> right<00:06:14.710> now<00:06:14.860> McCauley
