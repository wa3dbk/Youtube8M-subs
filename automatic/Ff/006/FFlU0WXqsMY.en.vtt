00:00:15.390 --> 00:00:22.150
 bowes personal decks and just know how to say 

00:00:19.539 --> 00:00:24.279
 another video this time of equipment and 

00:00:22.150 --> 00:00:27.429
 perception we have here a video of what 

00:00:24.279 --> 00:00:30.580
 If you have already seen the title of this trio 

00:00:27.429 --> 00:00:32.079
 They know they did not see how the critics 

00:00:30.580 --> 00:00:36.219
 from my partner my channel 

00:00:32.079 --> 00:00:37.930
 This video is only intended to inform the 

00:00:36.219 --> 00:00:40.629
 which is currently happening with 

00:00:37.930 --> 00:00:42.930
 own club but you ask for 

00:00:40.629 --> 00:00:46.270
 So I 'm talking about this situation. 

00:00:42.930 --> 00:00:49.539
 but I do not know if you have seen the 

00:00:46.270 --> 00:00:52.210
 news in recent days was then 

00:00:49.539 --> 00:00:55.000
 than the father - asked about 

00:00:52.210 --> 00:00:57.640
 60 employees including one 

00:00:55.000 --> 00:01:00.449
 own office of the game is in many 

00:00:57.640 --> 00:01:02.949
 of people saw this same news is 

00:01:00.449 --> 00:01:05.830
 begin to speculate that it could be 

00:01:02.949 --> 00:01:08.470
 signs that the game would be reaching the 

00:01:05.830 --> 00:01:12.549
 end but I 'll just leave the message here 

00:01:08.470 --> 00:01:14.140
 that you do not care about the end of the game 

00:01:12.549 --> 00:01:17.290
 because surely there is still enough 

00:01:14.140 --> 00:01:19.960
 far and the game will not end in 

00:01:17.290 --> 00:01:22.450
 next time much less will end 

00:01:19.960 --> 00:01:24.850
 seed cultivation of 60 employees 

00:01:22.450 --> 00:01:27.040
 it is also certain that these 60 officials 

00:01:24.850 --> 00:01:29.380
 that money has been described 

00:01:27.040 --> 00:01:32.320
 was being betrayed you can not be 

00:01:29.380 --> 00:01:35.049
 used for something else that the game is already 

00:01:32.320 --> 00:01:39.369
 for example may be used 

00:01:35.049 --> 00:01:42.969
 to create new ideas that wish 

00:01:39.369 --> 00:01:45.070
 intended to be placed in the game and 

00:01:42.969 --> 00:01:47.649
 therefore this money that will not be 

00:01:45.070 --> 00:01:49.810
 spent on employees can be used 

00:01:47.649 --> 00:01:52.329
 to further improve the game but 

00:01:49.810 --> 00:01:54.700
 Let's show you here is one of the 

00:01:52.329 --> 00:01:57.520
 graphics to explain some of the 

00:01:54.700 --> 00:01:59.469
 The game's current situation is in this place. 

00:01:57.520 --> 00:02:01.869
 Fixed only I got through the block 

00:01:59.469 --> 00:02:03.880
 including the dot with 11 logo of a 

00:02:01.869 --> 00:02:06.280
 member of the parent club team at the beginning 

00:02:03.880 --> 00:02:08.410
 I'm going to leave the link in the 

00:02:06.280 --> 00:02:12.610
 description but let's just start 

00:02:08.410 --> 00:02:13.870
 here is this first chart and we 

00:02:12.610 --> 00:02:16.000
 we see sometimes 

00:02:13.870 --> 00:02:18.459
 players over time this 

00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:21.310
 happens with all games that have the 

00:02:18.459 --> 00:02:25.269
 minimum success rate as the father and mother 

00:02:21.310 --> 00:02:27.489
 in the beginning is with greatly increase your 

00:02:25.269 --> 00:02:30.430
 public is increasingly important. 

00:02:27.489 --> 00:02:32.980
 show your audience new ideas always 

00:02:30.430 --> 00:02:35.560
 increase your players 

00:02:32.980 --> 00:02:38.260
 is this second chart we reached a 

00:02:35.560 --> 00:02:39.909
 between the game is no longer able to 

00:02:38.260 --> 00:02:42.209
 put more new things will not 

00:02:39.909 --> 00:02:45.849
 to achieve but are things that no longer 

00:02:42.209 --> 00:02:47.470
 attract more public happens is that arrives 

00:02:45.849 --> 00:02:49.569
 at a certain point in time when the 

00:02:47.470 --> 00:02:52.090
 own players play this same game 

00:02:49.569 --> 00:02:54.129
 stabilize ie does not diminish or 

00:02:52.090 --> 00:02:57.760
 therefore increases the game stayed 

00:02:54.129 --> 00:03:00.640
 practically always with the same public 

00:02:57.760 --> 00:03:02.590
 but as is obvious over time these 

00:03:00.640 --> 00:03:05.079
 people who are judging a 

00:03:02.590 --> 00:03:07.060
 certain game is and speaks in finished 

00:03:05.079 --> 00:03:09.310
 because these charts report a little 

00:03:07.060 --> 00:03:11.829
 than with all games and not 

00:03:09.310 --> 00:03:14.829
 only with the club but also with the father but 

00:03:11.829 --> 00:03:16.959
 At the end of a time people tire 

00:03:14.829 --> 00:03:19.269
 If a game starts then it starts there 

00:03:16.959 --> 00:03:21.639
 decrease the public as you see 

00:03:19.269 --> 00:03:24.069
 and was ashamed but the game in the 

00:03:21.639 --> 00:03:26.799
 attempt to attract more 

00:03:24.069 --> 00:03:27.609
 people still put some idea into 

00:03:26.799 --> 00:03:30.010
 force 

00:03:27.609 --> 00:03:31.660
 and it suits her and that she had blue again 

00:03:30.010 --> 00:03:33.940
 increases a lot 

00:03:31.660 --> 00:03:36.160
 again your audience so the game 

00:03:33.940 --> 00:03:38.950
 try to perform new things for ever 

00:03:36.160 --> 00:03:42.069
 lose but gain even more public 

00:03:38.950 --> 00:03:44.500
 it is here in this graph 

00:03:42.069 --> 00:03:48.819
 we see that over time no 

00:03:44.500 --> 00:03:51.400
 game no even game has ideas is 

00:03:48.819 --> 00:03:53.470
 infinite therefore over time 

00:03:51.400 --> 00:03:56.530
 so many ideas have already been put 

00:03:53.470 --> 00:03:59.530
 in practice ideas start to become scarce 

00:03:56.530 --> 00:04:02.079
 and therefore when these ideas begin to 

00:03:59.530 --> 00:04:04.329
 end the game no longer has ten new ones like 

00:04:02.079 --> 00:04:07.480
 is obvious and your audience starts then it's 

00:04:04.329 --> 00:04:09.879
 che it is perhaps the last 

00:04:07.480 --> 00:04:12.519
 times is happening a little bit with dad 

00:04:09.879 --> 00:04:15.849
 but for example if you saw guilt already 

00:04:12.519 --> 00:04:18.609
 has 800 new ideas to attract more and 

00:04:15.849 --> 00:04:21.699
 more people but in this chart 

00:04:18.609 --> 00:04:23.919
 practically is what nobody wants 

00:04:21.699 --> 00:04:25.599
 what happens is that a game like 

00:04:23.919 --> 00:04:27.220
 shock no one wants this to happen 

00:04:25.599 --> 00:04:29.800
 with squatter and baby 

00:04:27.220 --> 00:04:31.120
 Sun opinion this will not happen with the 

00:04:29.800 --> 00:04:33.760
 country double game 

00:04:31.120 --> 00:04:36.790
 honestly this happens because port 

00:04:33.760 --> 00:04:39.400
 When it is a game you have not played 

00:04:36.790 --> 00:04:41.500
 enough that they can keep the 

00:04:39.400 --> 00:04:42.400
 servers then obviously has 

00:04:41.500 --> 00:04:45.130
 what to close 

00:04:42.400 --> 00:04:47.560
 so when the cold blooded player 

00:04:45.130 --> 00:04:48.700
 today what is necessary to maintain 

00:04:47.560 --> 00:04:52.060
 servers 

00:04:48.700 --> 00:04:54.370
 obviously that is the game has to turn off 

00:04:52.060 --> 00:04:57.160
 these same servers in my opinion 

00:04:54.370 --> 00:05:00.760
 as I said earlier this situation does not 

00:04:57.160 --> 00:05:02.920
 will occur with the panel goes over 

00:05:00.760 --> 00:05:06.070
 a second situation occurs that I go 

00:05:02.920 --> 00:05:07.690
 show already if she is now 

00:05:06.070 --> 00:05:09.430
 on this personal chart this in my 

00:05:07.690 --> 00:05:10.780
 will still be able to conclude that 

00:05:09.430 --> 00:05:13.120
 a few years ago 

00:05:10.780 --> 00:05:15.520
 Now the game has already been at a 

00:05:13.120 --> 00:05:18.130
 vaf with enough godot but start to 

00:05:15.520 --> 00:05:20.770
 decrease a little until you stabilize and 

00:05:18.130 --> 00:05:22.900
 this stabilized sect means that 

00:05:20.770 --> 00:05:25.060
 for example the players who play there 

00:05:22.900 --> 00:05:27.250
 enough time and will never be a 

00:05:25.060 --> 00:05:29.650
 problem in the knee played g go always 

00:05:27.250 --> 00:05:31.930
 playing the game myself as per 

00:05:29.650 --> 00:05:34.419
 I do not play much like the club. 

00:05:31.930 --> 00:05:36.730
 regularly, but when there is a 

00:05:34.419 --> 00:05:39.550
 new thing just a new idea I'll pass 

00:05:36.730 --> 00:05:41.650
 through the game to see what's new 

00:05:39.550 --> 00:05:43.660
 therefore it is these players and these 

00:05:41.650 --> 00:05:45.310
 values ​​are sufficient to maintain the 

00:05:43.660 --> 00:05:47.190
 servers then when this 

00:05:45.310 --> 00:05:50.830
 happens the game was not simply 

00:05:47.190 --> 00:05:52.360
 keep your players but it 's just you 

00:05:50.830 --> 00:05:54.100
 want to leave the message because 

00:05:52.360 --> 00:05:56.440
 practically destroyed only brief 

00:05:54.100 --> 00:05:58.990
 inform a little is to worry 

00:05:56.440 --> 00:06:00.700
 also the players of the team but I only 

00:05:58.990 --> 00:06:02.440
 I want to leave the message that 

00:06:00.700 --> 00:06:04.600
 be concerned that the game may 

00:06:02.440 --> 00:06:07.870
 end because you ran away to end yet 

00:06:04.600 --> 00:06:11.229
 it's going to take quite a long time 

00:06:07.870 --> 00:06:13.360
 very long it is therefore not 

00:06:11.229 --> 00:06:15.880
 worry personally believe that the 

00:06:13.360 --> 00:06:18.160
 end of the game is still very far but it is 

00:06:15.880 --> 00:06:20.260
 only I did not play to see prove it 's a 

00:06:18.160 --> 00:06:22.930
 wiki in this video that the end is only one 

00:06:20.260 --> 00:06:25.930
 informative video but I ask this alone 

00:06:22.930 --> 00:06:28.750
 to pass on this video to the maximum of 

00:06:25.930 --> 00:06:30.210
 possible people who can pass 

00:06:28.750 --> 00:06:33.160
 for our friends for everyone 

00:06:30.210 --> 00:06:35.380
 people can know what really 

00:06:33.160 --> 00:06:37.960
 it's happening, not to be 

00:06:35.380 --> 00:06:40.770
 sad or worried about the club 

00:06:37.960 --> 00:06:43.430
 But this is it, but it's only good, Brazil.
