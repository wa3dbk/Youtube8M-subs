 the gust she's not here 

00:00:08.339 --> 00:00:11.339
 facing the nascent controversy responded to the afp 

00:00:14.209 --> 00:00:17.209
 during the holidays it's him 

00:00:18.710 --> 00:00:21.710
 bad no a tenor 

00:00:23.730 --> 00:00:26.730
 the street 

00:00:27.710 --> 00:00:30.710
 what is it for 

00:00:45.450 --> 00:00:46.840
 the period 

00:00:46.840 --> 00:00:49.370
 Yum 

00:00:49.370 --> 00:00:51.100
 even when 

00:00:51.100 --> 00:00:54.100
 by ben feller had taken the first step 

00:00:57.630 --> 00:00:59.290
 not yet 

00:00:59.290 --> 00:01:00.910
 even unfounded 

00:01:00.910 --> 00:01:02.830
 the best proof we have the wind in our sails 

00:01:02.830 --> 00:01:05.680
 as if that was the magic of Christmas 

00:01:05.680 --> 00:01:07.720
 those stormy moments 

00:01:07.720 --> 00:01:09.290
 his argument 

00:01:09.290 --> 00:01:12.290
 alain laurent ournac lasallois further 

00:01:13.080 --> 00:01:15.850
 as for him that returns it will be very well 

00:01:15.850 --> 00:01:18.340
 55 years 

00:01:18.340 --> 00:01:19.210
 the lines 

00:01:19.210 --> 00:01:22.280
 abstaining from 

00:01:22.280 --> 00:01:26.850
 there we are more in the subway to its guardians - a corner a fate at the helm 

00:01:26.850 --> 00:01:29.850
 in parallel the center of free paris 

00:01:32.530 --> 00:01:35.530
 watch them without denying yourself at a distance 

00:01:37.950 --> 00:01:39.800
 - meaning 

00:01:39.800 --> 00:01:41.500
 this is Christmas magic 

00:01:41.500 --> 00:01:42.670
 while boys 

00:01:42.670 --> 00:01:44.070
 her hair 

00:01:44.070 --> 00:01:47.070
 wait 

00:02:13.739 --> 00:02:16.559
 before I was a student 

00:02:16.559 --> 00:02:19.099
 before it's done 

00:02:19.099 --> 00:02:20.420
 on the French radio side 

00:02:20.420 --> 00:02:24.000
 I am super disappointed I have not found a place in the battle not less than 

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:27.289
 three years 

00:02:27.289 --> 00:02:30.689
 while I would like us to do the same thing that it was nice enough 

00:02:30.689 --> 00:02:33.689
 to complete the face head 

00:02:36.069 --> 00:02:37.209
 the lagardÃ¨re group 

00:02:37.209 --> 00:02:39.209
 after the parenthesis 

00:02:39.209 --> 00:02:42.209
 hahahaha 

00:02:47.969 --> 00:02:50.969
 it's here 

00:02:57.079 --> 00:02:59.469
 ralalala rewrite it 

00:02:59.469 --> 00:03:02.799
 she is active 

00:03:02.799 --> 00:03:04.719
 here I am waiting to see 

00:03:04.719 --> 00:03:07.719
 the call was visited 

00:03:08.739 --> 00:03:09.849
 to the press 

00:03:09.849 --> 00:03:11.969
 his mother 

00:03:11.969 --> 00:03:15.049
 van rompuy 

00:03:15.049 --> 00:03:18.049
 countries j 

00:03:20.029 --> 00:03:23.029
 four days 

00:03:41.339 --> 00:03:44.349
 it's done we tried uncomplicated 

00:03:44.349 --> 00:03:46.360
 in my book I went out not miss 

00:03:46.360 --> 00:03:49.539
 the oldest of them by the British 

00:03:49.539 --> 00:03:52.539
 it must have been the culprit with the departure of 

00:03:54.389 --> 00:03:56.789
 this shortcut 

00:03:56.789 --> 00:03:59.789
 he specified that the attacked had appealed 

00:04:02.839 --> 00:04:04.699
 so what is Saturday 

00:04:04.699 --> 00:04:08.939
 Lorraine who is logical a surprise was waiting had met christophe the 

00:04:08.939 --> 00:04:11.939
 clear 

00:04:12.599 --> 00:04:14.349
 ap ap ap ap 

00:04:14.349 --> 00:04:17.180
 amy winehouse we 

00:04:17.180 --> 00:04:18.609
 the effect that will allow 

00:04:18.609 --> 00:04:19.410
 the case 

00:04:19.410 --> 00:04:21.009
 in the meantime it's madness 

00:04:21.009 --> 00:04:23.800
 because you do not know why it's black smoke 

00:04:23.800 --> 00:04:26.800
 we did not know how to do it then 

00:04:29.360 --> 00:04:31.219
 many years later 

00:04:31.219 --> 00:04:33.870
 because if this movie is announced at Disneyland Paris 

00:04:33.870 --> 00:04:36.870
 positive with us 

00:04:38.219 --> 00:04:40.819
 little worry 

00:04:40.819 --> 00:04:42.090
 he was listened to 

00:04:42.090 --> 00:04:43.890
 christophe is here to talk to us a little bit beyond 

00:04:43.890 --> 00:04:47.230
 brings a lot of the christmas season to disneyland-paris still on sale from 

00:04:47.230 --> 00:04:51.540
 less than the decor 25 years participate in its very lively so what's going on 

00:04:51.540 --> 00:04:54.020
 actually goes into Christmas 

00:04:54.020 --> 00:04:57.729
 there are many more things because we obviously have 

00:04:57.729 --> 00:04:59.449
 that curves the parquet 

00:04:59.449 --> 00:05:02.080
 and we fancy his coat various bugs you can you 

00:05:02.080 --> 00:05:05.819
 to see today all these snowy beds is after 

00:05:05.819 --> 00:05:09.539
 illuminated and so we have several shows whose only on the 

00:05:09.539 --> 00:05:13.150
 program which she boasts mickey especially the magic of the verb confirming that 

00:05:13.150 --> 00:05:15.639
 we put scholarships in the m version 

00:05:15.639 --> 00:05:17.969
 then we have the usual nation 

00:05:17.969 --> 00:05:21.089
 who is the youngest and especially the breath every night at 18 o'clock if 

00:05:21.089 --> 00:05:24.569
 the crash illumination ceremony 

00:05:24.569 --> 00:05:27.569
 the princesses these are the characters are fictitious 

00:05:28.330 --> 00:05:30.889
 and so the logo is an eye ceremony 

00:05:30.889 --> 00:05:34.569
 unique so every evening around 18 hours and 19 hours depending on the version of 

00:05:34.569 --> 00:05:36.080
 his side 

00:05:36.080 --> 00:05:38.449
 we must move a singing nation that will combine 

00:05:38.449 --> 00:05:42.150
 a whole part the lighting level which is extraordinary so they are 

00:05:42.150 --> 00:05:45.629
 all london tracks we're just tickling office a million from 

00:05:45.629 --> 00:05:47.430
 bright spots 

00:05:47.430 --> 00:05:51.180
 and so if you take example street lamps struthers about 7 

00:05:51.180 --> 00:05:52.580
 km 

00:05:52.580 --> 00:05:56.720
 of the world the little ones that are going to light up does so much here and the castle of 

00:05:56.720 --> 00:05:59.330
 thanvill of using a group of course 

00:05:59.330 --> 00:06:02.600
 but about 300 miles to 400 miles filling in 

00:06:02.600 --> 00:06:04.939
 they will punctuate the castle tonight 

00:06:04.939 --> 00:06:07.939
 that's what interests us in the end also the little secrets 

00:06:09.059 --> 00:06:11.599
 so we have a little bit of a breakage he adds the preparation of 

00:06:11.599 --> 00:06:15.819
 shows how is today more than 500 visitors to you all and this 

00:06:15.819 --> 00:06:19.099
 what is happening concretely is saying everything to know where and how 

00:06:19.099 --> 00:06:23.139
 it is far from being reduced I think about it as a whole 

00:06:24.270 --> 00:06:27.330
 the closing time of this season where we will talk about next season 

00:06:27.900 --> 00:06:31.860
 so it's so much work the new creative course group in 

00:06:31.860 --> 00:06:35.110
 party to set up with the production as well as the planning of 

00:06:35.110 --> 00:06:36.210
 repetition 

00:06:36.210 --> 00:06:38.970
 and about five weeks before the opening of Christmas we are in 

00:06:38.970 --> 00:06:40.389
 studio rehearsal 

00:06:40.389 --> 00:06:44.440
 but the filthy last nights of decoration editing we are also 

00:06:44.439 --> 00:06:45.650
 in competition 

00:06:45.650 --> 00:06:47.409
 with all the teams can occur 

00:06:47.409 --> 00:06:50.209
 for the floor so that the different shows so in fact we work the 

00:06:50.209 --> 00:06:50.819
 night 

00:06:50.819 --> 00:06:53.840
 and so the visitors to see the young people who made overnight one 

00:06:53.839 --> 00:06:55.580
 will spend the wine at christmas 

00:06:55.580 --> 00:07:00.230
 and that's the magic of disney land past it's amazing yesterday behind 

00:07:00.229 --> 00:07:03.659
 we can see above five months a pregnant woman 

00:07:03.659 --> 00:07:04.460
 it's nice 

00:07:04.460 --> 00:07:06.029
 a competition of specialists 

00:07:06.029 --> 00:07:09.109
 then the huge civilian rescue as you can see it shell out 

00:07:09.109 --> 00:07:10.539
 almost four meters high 

00:07:10.539 --> 00:07:12.119
 24 tons mans 

00:07:12.119 --> 00:07:15.329
 twenty-three people are needed to set it up an account a 

00:07:15.329 --> 00:07:16.349
 only night 

00:07:16.349 --> 00:07:19.349
 about six years ago to ask the elected officials who will be installed on this 

00:07:19.349 --> 00:07:19.990
 score 

00:07:19.990 --> 00:07:23.849
 how is it relatively young maliki do the same it is still is it that 

00:07:23.849 --> 00:07:25.880
 justice is not a success all along the line 

00:07:25.880 --> 00:07:28.790
 it still takes time to settle about the sum then the season where 

00:07:28.790 --> 00:07:32.600
 she settles down in just six days done we go from halloween to our 

00:07:32.600 --> 00:07:35.669
 friends so that we have six days ahead of us to transform 

00:07:35.669 --> 00:07:38.419
 the park henri-bourassa in his study 

00:07:38.419 --> 00:07:40.059
 i have something to ask christian 

00:07:40.059 --> 00:07:42.869
 it remains a little bit of time since the list is long what do you tell him 

00:07:42.869 --> 00:07:44.009
 advise to go see 

00:07:44.009 --> 00:07:47.339
 so I advise you to go see the show that the magic of the net 

00:07:47.339 --> 00:07:49.520
 but if you want we do not go together 

00:07:49.520 --> 00:07:52.009
 it's an extraordinary show in a setting 

00:07:52.009 --> 00:07:53.189
 as european champion 

00:07:53.189 --> 00:07:56.189
 but with a real rink bnp paribas 

00:08:01.479 --> 00:08:02.279
