00:00:00.069 --> 00:00:04.160
 I'm crazy about everyone, maybe for office here, text, we need to have a confirmation 

00:00:05.220 --> 00:00:09.370
 also from this otherwise the situation is as you say but it could be 

00:00:09.370 --> 00:00:12.370
 let's see this trinity 

00:00:14.129 --> 00:00:17.589
 kazakhstan 

00:00:17.589 --> 00:00:20.789
 verona plan confirms with regard to 

00:00:20.789 --> 00:00:23.640
 and the order of arrival so if it was valid 

00:00:23.640 --> 00:00:26.909
 the weather says I spent what's left. amauri comes back up 

00:00:28.349 --> 00:00:32.330
 none. our computer right now in focus 

00:00:32.330 --> 00:00:36.710
 in front of you I say pezzolla or if instead it must be considered is valid villas 

00:00:36.710 --> 00:00:40.820
 In the meantime the umbrellas are visible on the central tribune 

00:00:40.820 --> 00:00:44.830
 definitely been state cinecity of its own lowered stationing 

00:00:44.830 --> 00:00:48.850
 of the rain that made it necessary to interrupt kf3 but cost. it is not 

00:00:48.850 --> 00:00:52.510
 and taken for granted that the conditions of the infernal track with snack for i 

00:00:52.510 --> 00:00:53.270
 smaller 

00:00:53.270 --> 00:00:57.620
 it would be desirable that the 60 political mini cakes could be carried out 

00:00:57.620 --> 00:00:58.879
 because the motion 

00:00:58.879 --> 00:01:02.739
 it is nicer for pilots to express themselves after 3 days they have worked in 

00:01:02.739 --> 00:01:05.840
 that direction also with the chassis and engine settings 

00:01:05.840 --> 00:01:11.229
 instead of running in the wet which becomes a lot more a lottery too 

00:01:11.229 --> 00:01:14.770
 if from the spectacular point of view also the rain that lies as already read 

00:01:14.770 --> 00:01:16.090
 to French shares 

00:01:16.090 --> 00:01:19.960
 also to say of the formula 1 recently obviously contributes 

00:01:19.960 --> 00:01:23.579
 much to revolutionize the values ​​in the field and therefore also to bring out hotels 

00:01:23.579 --> 00:01:26.830
 riders more marked and therefore a contributes 

00:01:26.830 --> 00:01:31.310
 to see if it was to create situations of spectacle surely and also to 

00:01:31.310 --> 00:01:36.290
 move the charts a little and shorten them here dear reopen them 

00:01:36.290 --> 00:01:40.840
 and so we say that a go kart race among others that of the 60d card will be 

00:01:40.840 --> 00:01:45.610
 a very fast sprint race because they are 12 laps then 

00:01:45.610 --> 00:01:49.690
 and these children are not those who, in relatively short length, will touch everything 

00:01:49.690 --> 00:01:52.079
 so it will be a supersprint race 

00:01:52.079 --> 00:01:56.560
 prices the mind rain pop-art contribute just create many 

00:01:56.560 --> 00:01:58.240
 situations 

00:01:58.240 --> 00:02:02.680
 dd spectacular protagoniza break the rankings we publish among other things 

00:02:02.680 --> 00:02:04.670
 avetrana 

00:02:04.670 --> 00:02:06.570
 the spectators of for 

00:02:06.570 --> 00:02:09.149
 right now there is summer circuit 

00:02:09.149 --> 00:02:13.030
 eni catenella the economist I love you and your son 

00:02:13.030 --> 00:02:17.260
 coool participate in the erasmus to guarantee it is viterbo a 

00:02:17.260 --> 00:02:22.670
 lazzate you were the perfect wave thanks to how many characters of this one 

00:02:22.670 --> 00:02:26.759
 morning of the recovery recovery race went very well 

00:02:26.759 --> 00:02:30.589
 fair among the qualified just the last round there was a contact with me 

00:02:30.589 --> 00:02:32.890
 same order the card room 

00:02:32.890 --> 00:02:34.609
 with these means this 

00:02:34.609 --> 00:02:38.729
 they are a little bit smaller than kf3 and obviously for the 

00:02:38.729 --> 00:02:42.529
 proportion of the guys who allow pilots to make purchases also 

00:02:42.529 --> 00:02:46.459
 braking tools po4 sliced ​​just what happened this 

00:02:46.459 --> 00:02:49.919
 morning in the article related to a statement this cuba you have 

00:02:49.919 --> 00:02:53.109
 framed among other things that the curve of the padoca of the mechanics re-chemistry 

00:02:53.109 --> 00:02:54.559
 decide or follow you 

00:02:54.559 --> 00:02:58.869
 beautiful race arrived in 4 for children side by side obviously the space 

00:02:58.869 --> 00:03:02.559
 for all there was none that they had and the worst was missing 

00:03:02.559 --> 00:03:06.939
 qualification right on the last lap, however, with the driver icon to the staff 

00:03:06.939 --> 00:03:10.909
 because my father is creating around if I were to grow up obviously 

00:03:10.909 --> 00:03:12.620
 very young the first season 

00:03:12.620 --> 00:03:16.250
 important meanwhile we see that the children this framed here and robert balasko 

00:03:16.250 --> 00:03:18.250
 also core with our team 

00:03:18.250 --> 00:03:21.300
 on the left is sofia fior secchiona 

00:03:21.300 --> 00:03:26.110
 of the many lady that run in this sixty years of paper together with becuse n 

00:03:26.110 --> 00:03:30.640
 one also recognizes Lorenzo Trevisanutto of pilots with a little to see in me 

00:03:30.640 --> 00:03:33.910
 this pellet break race director also created some of the conditions of the 

00:03:33.910 --> 00:03:35.119
 track 

00:03:35.119 --> 00:03:39.299
 that obviously in me this situation with the rain fell and a lot of rubber 

00:03:39.299 --> 00:03:43.199
 which settled on the race weekends with my qualifying stages 

00:03:43.199 --> 00:03:47.469
 mind is the most insidious situation because the track is very slippery hey 

00:03:47.469 --> 00:03:50.979
 that the drivers who will still be with these conditions forced to leave 

00:03:50.979 --> 00:03:54.569
 with lesbians because it is obviously not wet from reine especially in the first ones 

00:03:54.569 --> 00:03:57.340
 laps will have to find the feeling is right 

00:03:57.340 --> 00:04:00.670
 rabbit traced a situation that in me all these three days of 

00:04:00.670 --> 00:04:03.920
 qualification never find cat that I have seen pirates 

00:04:03.920 --> 00:04:08.920
 quite perplexed in front of the same and the track. the station is a post 

00:04:09.809 --> 00:04:11.659
 for undefined with me 

00:04:11.659 --> 00:04:14.709
 hopefully been transferred to goose leather room 

00:04:15.299 --> 00:04:20.169
 m quiet evidently perfect then d 

00:04:20.169 --> 00:04:21.380
 d take 

00:04:21.380 --> 00:04:22.800
 the start 

00:04:22.800 --> 00:04:26.639
 if this is a feature that common info 

00:04:26.639 --> 00:04:30.639
 of all these guys these data shots nikita mazzetti in one of the 

00:04:30.639 --> 00:04:34.569
 so many Russian pilots who come to Italy in the Italian CSAI championship to do 

00:04:34.569 --> 00:04:38.900
 experience in the field of training this instead eh 

00:04:38.900 --> 00:04:44.100
 alessio lorandi who has finished his mkf 3 race and is going to paper 

00:04:44.100 --> 00:04:47.310
 they are deposited at the closed park where they are under the orders of the 

00:04:47.310 --> 00:04:50.770
 technical commissioners for the verification of technical conformity of the items a 

00:04:50.770 --> 00:04:53.990
 the kf3 eagle has officially closed its commitment 

00:04:57.360 --> 00:05:01.770
 the creator with anna Japanese driver who runs with our official team 

00:05:01.770 --> 00:05:05.330
 site to underline how much of the Italian csai enrique championship 

00:05:05.330 --> 00:05:09.590
 we are the pilots from every kind of country because in Italy I told you a little 

00:05:09.590 --> 00:05:12.800
 that times in our chronicles 

00:05:12.800 --> 00:05:13.840
 let's say 

00:05:13.840 --> 00:05:17.949
 the madness of karting and therefore come to experience 

00:05:17.949 --> 00:05:21.650
 this is very important for the continuation of their career 

00:05:21.650 --> 00:05:26.870
 finished with the 60 mini card then you pass the kf3 then to the kf2 after there is the famous one 

00:05:26.870 --> 00:05:31.400
 crossroads towards motoring for those pilots who have the possibility of 

00:05:31.400 --> 00:05:34.400
 undertakes the penalties categories 

00:05:35.889 --> 00:05:41.050
 the categories those automotive formats formed of meanwhile it seems 

00:05:42.020 --> 00:05:43.509
 that 

00:05:43.509 --> 00:05:49.320
 the race director establishes for the kf3 ulna recovery category we say with 

00:05:49.319 --> 00:05:54.180
 a second round of 5 laps this year communication that arrives now sends us 

00:05:54.180 --> 00:05:58.580
 unofficial it is official cn confirmed that they are in all this petrone intends 

00:05:58.580 --> 00:06:02.029
 why children relaxing minicafe are waiting 

00:06:02.029 --> 00:06:05.879
 without helmet and overalls for which the colleague will still have to see engaged 

00:06:05.879 --> 00:06:06.879
 category 

00:06:06.879 --> 00:06:11.349
 greater than the caprese 3 then make turns that they had made enter 

00:06:11.349 --> 00:06:14.529
 for that matter the ranking will be updated on the 12th lap and then lap 

00:06:14.529 --> 00:06:18.379
 present the expenses the red flag to save itself then we will do a second one 

00:06:18.379 --> 00:06:21.580
 manche and that we are confirmed d5 ride there will be the sum of the times 

00:06:21.580 --> 00:06:25.839
 then the winner of the actual determined race. from the sum of the times of 

00:06:25.839 --> 00:06:26.720
 these two 

00:06:26.720 --> 00:06:30.840
 tip in fact I was looking for the provisional ranking but I see that the 

00:06:30.840 --> 00:06:33.680
 our life-time i10 of billposting open 

00:06:33.680 --> 00:06:38.840
 effects then we have confirmed eh to the restart soon then of 

00:06:39.550 --> 00:06:42.550
 other 5 TVs 

00:06:43.650 --> 00:06:47.919
 it is made faint data 10 minutes is just a technical time that the 

00:06:47.919 --> 00:06:52.480
 race director ask let's say to make the track dry 

00:06:52.479 --> 00:06:54.170
 bientina and conditions 

00:06:54.170 --> 00:06:58.440
 it is acceptable to make this 5gb males obviously is a situation that 

00:06:58.440 --> 00:07:02.060
 we have also recently seen with the formula 1 montecarlo with the headboard 

00:07:02.060 --> 00:07:06.990
 in the second run it is only 5 laps will be very spectacular because these 

00:07:06.990 --> 00:07:11.410
 pilots will do the starting procedure then the warm-up can after the 

00:07:11.410 --> 00:07:15.410
 departure instead where g will respect the position my face there are at least 5 o 

00:07:15.410 --> 00:07:21.320
 6 pilots who can stand in front of llamo saw pezzola lorandi balsam pay 

00:07:21.320 --> 00:07:26.270
 all dressed up then probably they will do 5 qualifying laps and it will 

00:07:26.270 --> 00:07:29.970
 show will really be artists also because 5 laps of a very track 

00:07:29.970 --> 00:07:31.540
 good which is to 

00:07:31.540 --> 00:07:37.200
 video from all text in my life 10 meters so really a sprinter race where 

00:07:37.200 --> 00:07:40.750
 however we must then go and do some calculations because it is not said that i 

00:07:40.750 --> 00:07:42.440
 pirates we see in the head 

00:07:42.440 --> 00:07:45.590
 however the Italian pirate is not the first to reach this goal 

00:07:45.590 --> 00:07:47.729
 second mass will then be 1000 

00:07:47.729 --> 00:07:52.860
 winner in the meantime from the direction that they say that the time to pass the line Rome 

00:07:52.860 --> 00:07:56.580
 for advertising we do not do it without too many we find ourselves in a while live 

00:07:56.580 --> 00:07:57.210
 from the born
