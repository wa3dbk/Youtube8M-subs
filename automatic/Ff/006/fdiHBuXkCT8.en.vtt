00:01:09.689 --> 00:01:14.220
 you put a pan with water one 

00:01:12.420 --> 00:01:16.890
 only a little water does not have to be 

00:01:14.220 --> 00:01:18.479

00:01:16.890 --> 00:01:21.299

 so we're going to stay now 

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:28.920
 babysitting this here for about ten minutes 

00:01:26.250 --> 00:01:30.360
 more or less or until you reach 

00:01:28.920 --> 00:01:32.729
 have a thermometer until you reach the 

00:01:30.360 --> 00:01:34.710
 temperature of 70 degrees but usually 

00:01:32.729 --> 00:01:36.720
 ten minutes is enough time then 

00:01:34.710 --> 00:01:38.820
 account on the clock and 10 minutes 

00:01:36.720 --> 00:01:41.820
 always keep an eye on a mixture of 

00:01:38.820 --> 00:01:44.700
 until it gets louder and 

00:01:41.820 --> 00:01:51.149
 the flames are positive 

00:01:44.700 --> 00:01:52.049

 You can pick up sleeves car. 

00:01:55.240 --> 00:02:01.030
 the pain and then you pass the sieve for me 

00:01:59.020 --> 00:02:02.979
 stay neighbors well or you can 

00:02:01.030 --> 00:02:03.670
 buy that frozen mouth and it was like 

00:02:02.979 --> 00:02:06.250
 I made 

00:02:03.670 --> 00:02:12.040
 and then they leave and they play. 

00:02:06.250 --> 00:02:14.760

00:02:12.040 --> 00:02:18.190
 my beater the fresh cream 

00:02:14.760 --> 00:02:19.930
 to whip in whipped cream or 

00:02:18.190 --> 00:02:21.640
 put a little vanilla too 

00:02:19.930 --> 00:02:24.220
 just to give a little taste 

00:02:21.640 --> 00:02:29.799
 we will beat it here to stay 

00:02:24.220 --> 00:02:31.540
 thicker chile hit and became one 

00:02:29.799 --> 00:02:33.310
 firm consistency 

00:02:31.540 --> 00:02:36.430
 You do not even need to talk about what I 

00:02:33.310 --> 00:02:38.530
 I put it not with 1 kg but you 

00:02:36.430 --> 00:02:44.920

00:02:55.750 --> 00:03:01.030
 back in 22 by 12 centimeters and I 

00:02:58.870 --> 00:03:03.160
 I put a movie here, I think 

00:03:01.030 --> 00:03:04.480
 the film just to make it much easier on 

00:03:03.160 --> 00:03:07.989
 time we told you that 

00:03:04.480 --> 00:03:14.950
 Never put it like this with a movie. 

00:03:07.989 --> 00:03:15.850
 You'll already have this mixture in here. 

00:03:14.950 --> 00:03:17.829

00:03:15.850 --> 00:03:19.520

 Let's see how it got to be formed. 

00:03:35.030 --> 00:03:39.500
 saw how it is so if he comes out is super 

00:03:37.490 --> 00:03:41.630
 easy because of the plastic film that the 

00:03:39.500 --> 00:03:44.090
 people outside of themselves informed us 

00:03:41.630 --> 00:03:46.570
 placed agents so they report neither 

00:03:44.090 --> 00:03:48.980
 easy 

00:03:46.570 --> 00:03:50.510
