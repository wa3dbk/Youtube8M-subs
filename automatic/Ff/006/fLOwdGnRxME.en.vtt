00:00:18.560 --> 00:00:18.570 
when they have us on the barcode you

00:00:18.570 --> 00:00:20.269 
when they have us on the barcode you
never<00:00:18.810> want<00:00:19.050> barcodes<00:00:19.500> sticking<00:00:19.859> out<00:00:19.949> even<00:00:20.220> if

00:00:20.269 --> 00:00:20.279 
never want barcodes sticking out even if

00:00:20.279 --> 00:00:22.550 
never want barcodes sticking out even if
you<00:00:20.310> send<00:00:20.699> any<00:00:20.910> other<00:00:21.060> boxes<00:00:21.539> right<00:00:22.140> because

00:00:22.550 --> 00:00:22.560 
you send any other boxes right because

00:00:22.560 --> 00:00:24.410 
you send any other boxes right because
they<00:00:22.740> out<00:00:22.769> of<00:00:23.100> all<00:00:23.310> that<00:00:23.460> automated<00:00:24.000> stuff

00:00:24.410 --> 00:00:24.420 
they out of all that automated stuff

00:00:24.420 --> 00:00:34.130 
they out of all that automated stuff
trying<00:00:24.960> to<00:00:25.350> the<00:00:25.410> barcodes<00:00:25.890> where<00:00:27.289> I<00:00:32.989> make<00:00:33.989> sure

00:00:34.130 --> 00:00:34.140 
trying to the barcodes where I make sure

00:00:34.140 --> 00:00:36.200 
trying to the barcodes where I make sure
my<00:00:34.260> edges<00:00:34.290> are<00:00:34.739> are<00:00:35.070> really<00:00:35.340> close<00:00:35.730> they're

00:00:36.200 --> 00:00:36.210 
my edges are are really close they're

00:00:36.210 --> 00:00:38.180 
my edges are are really close they're
really<00:00:36.480> good<00:00:36.719> because<00:00:37.620> sometimes<00:00:37.829> when<00:00:38.129> you

00:00:38.180 --> 00:00:38.190 
really good because sometimes when you

00:00:38.190 --> 00:00:48.860 
really good because sometimes when you
put<00:00:38.399> on<00:00:38.550> there<00:00:38.760> are<00:00:39.059> so<00:00:39.270> good<00:00:47.450> and<00:00:48.450> if<00:00:48.660> it's<00:00:48.809> a

00:00:48.860 --> 00:00:48.870 
put on there are so good and if it's a

00:00:48.870 --> 00:00:54.439 
put on there are so good and if it's a
light<00:00:49.110> and<00:00:50.120> then<00:00:51.120> I<00:00:51.149> go<00:00:51.270> one<00:00:53.090> one<00:00:54.090> down<00:00:54.270> the

00:00:54.439 --> 00:00:54.449 
light and then I go one one down the

00:00:54.449 --> 00:01:04.429 
light and then I go one one down the
middle<00:00:54.690> it's<00:00:55.020> one<00:00:55.320> thing<00:00:55.440> on<00:00:55.620> each<00:00:56.280> edge<00:01:03.439> so

00:01:04.429 --> 00:01:04.439 
middle it's one thing on each edge so

00:01:04.439 --> 00:01:09.010 
middle it's one thing on each edge so
this<00:01:04.920> is<00:01:05.040> how<00:01:05.159> I<00:01:05.220> do<00:01:05.339> it<00:01:05.369> for<00:01:05.580> all<00:01:05.640> my<00:01:05.850> books

00:01:09.010 --> 00:01:09.020 

00:01:09.020 --> 00:01:15.380 

over<00:01:10.020> laughing<00:01:10.230> I<00:01:13.460> like<00:01:14.460> the<00:01:14.610> way<00:01:14.700> your<00:01:14.910> gun

00:01:15.380 --> 00:01:15.390 
over laughing I like the way your gun

00:01:15.390 --> 00:01:27.290 
over laughing I like the way your gun
feels<00:01:15.660> one<00:01:15.900> more<00:01:16.080> strip<00:01:16.320> on<00:01:16.500> this<00:01:17.720> oops<00:01:26.300> and

00:01:27.290 --> 00:01:27.300 
feels one more strip on this oops and

00:01:27.300 --> 00:01:29.030 
feels one more strip on this oops and

00:01:29.030 --> 00:01:29.040 
then if there's a real wall spot there I

00:01:29.040 --> 00:01:30.469 
then if there's a real wall spot there I
push<00:01:29.340> it<00:01:29.460> down<00:01:29.580> and<00:01:29.640> just<00:01:29.700> so<00:01:29.880> I<00:01:29.940> get<00:01:30.120> every

coming out from that so but yeah so

00:01:50.580 --> 00:01:52.430 
coming out from that so but yeah so
basically<00:01:51.030> whenever<00:01:51.270> little<00:01:51.780> one<00:01:52.050> downside

00:01:52.430 --> 00:01:52.440 
basically whenever little one downside

00:01:52.440 --> 00:01:55.010 
basically whenever little one downside
the<00:01:53.009> one<00:01:53.250> next<00:01:53.610> to<00:01:53.790> it<00:01:53.910> overlapping<00:01:54.390> this<00:01:54.780> one

00:01:55.010 --> 00:01:55.020 
the one next to it overlapping this one

00:01:55.020 --> 00:01:57.469 
the one next to it overlapping this one
the<00:01:55.740> other<00:01:55.860> side<00:01:56.160> the<00:01:56.340> one<00:01:56.460> overlap<00:01:56.880> you<00:01:57.030> go

00:01:57.469 --> 00:01:57.479 
the other side the one overlap you go

00:01:57.479 --> 00:02:01.070 
the other side the one overlap you go
that's<00:01:58.410> super<00:01:58.800> strong
