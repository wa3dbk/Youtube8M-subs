it is standard definition but it takes
amazing<00:00:17.400> video<00:00:19.580> I've<00:00:20.580> always<00:00:21.029> thought<00:00:21.720> that

00:00:21.769 --> 00:00:21.779 
amazing video I've always thought that

00:00:21.779 --> 00:00:23.570 
amazing video I've always thought that
high-definition<00:00:22.140> is<00:00:22.800> not<00:00:22.980> really<00:00:23.220> all<00:00:23.250> that

00:00:23.570 --> 00:00:23.580 
high-definition is not really all that

00:00:23.580 --> 00:00:24.470 
high-definition is not really all that
it's<00:00:23.699> cracked<00:00:23.880> up<00:00:24.150> to<00:00:24.180> be

00:00:24.470 --> 00:00:24.480 
it's cracked up to be

00:00:24.480 --> 00:00:29.929 
it's cracked up to be
and<00:00:27.710> well<00:00:28.710> this<00:00:28.830> camcorder<00:00:29.070> has<00:00:29.460> done<00:00:29.670> pretty

00:00:29.929 --> 00:00:29.939 
and well this camcorder has done pretty

00:00:58.790 --> 00:00:58.800 
playback and this will actually not move

00:00:58.800 --> 00:01:01.549 
playback and this will actually not move
at<00:00:58.920> all<00:00:59.070> unless<00:00:59.280> you<00:00:59.579> press<00:00:59.789> this<00:01:00.210> in<00:01:00.480> and<00:01:01.020> then

00:01:04.399 --> 00:01:04.409 
click it once and then basically you can

click it once and then basically you can
just<00:01:04.650> you<00:01:05.489> can<00:01:05.640> keep<00:01:05.820> going<00:01:06.000> to<00:01:06.210> any<00:01:06.360> one<00:01:06.600> of

00:01:06.620 --> 00:01:06.630 
just you can keep going to any one of

00:01:06.630 --> 00:01:08.120 
just you can keep going to any one of
these<00:01:06.780> after<00:01:07.320> you've<00:01:07.439> clicked<00:01:07.680> it<00:01:07.799> in<00:01:07.890> once

00:01:08.120 --> 00:01:08.130 
these after you've clicked it in once

00:01:08.130 --> 00:01:10.789 
these after you've clicked it in once
but<00:01:08.460> when<00:01:08.610> you<00:01:08.700> scroll<00:01:08.939> it<00:01:09.090> back<00:01:09.240> to<00:01:09.390> off<00:01:09.799> this

00:01:10.789 --> 00:01:10.799 
but when you scroll it back to off this

00:01:10.799 --> 00:01:13.359 
but when you scroll it back to off this
will<00:01:10.979> pop<00:01:11.130> back<00:01:11.340> out<00:01:11.520> and<00:01:11.820> it'll<00:01:12.390> lock<00:01:12.570> it<00:01:12.810> and

00:01:13.359 --> 00:01:13.369 
will pop back out and it'll lock it and

00:01:13.369 --> 00:01:15.499 
will pop back out and it'll lock it and
that's<00:01:14.369> actually<00:01:14.670> kind<00:01:14.850> of<00:01:14.909> helpful<00:01:15.150> because

00:01:15.499 --> 00:01:15.509 
that's actually kind of helpful because

00:01:15.509 --> 00:01:19.190 
that's actually kind of helpful because
you<00:01:16.140> don't<00:01:16.680> want<00:01:16.799> to<00:01:16.860> waste<00:01:17.009> battery<00:01:17.430> life<00:01:18.200> and

00:01:19.190 --> 00:01:19.200 
you don't want to waste battery life and

00:01:19.200 --> 00:01:22.490 
you don't want to waste battery life and
speaking<00:01:19.920> of<00:01:20.009> the<00:01:20.070> battery<00:01:21.049> this<00:01:22.049> is<00:01:22.229> it<00:01:22.380> right

00:01:22.490 --> 00:01:22.500 
speaking of the battery this is it right

00:01:22.500 --> 00:01:26.390 
speaking of the battery this is it right
here<00:01:22.710> it's<00:01:22.860> a<00:01:22.920> rechargeable<00:01:23.490> battery<00:01:23.520> and<00:01:25.400> you

00:01:26.390 --> 00:01:26.400 
here it's a rechargeable battery and you

00:01:26.400 --> 00:01:28.819 
here it's a rechargeable battery and you
can<00:01:26.460> see<00:01:26.729> here<00:01:26.939> it<00:01:27.030> says<00:01:27.060> recycle<00:01:27.869> so<00:01:28.380> you<00:01:28.470> this

00:01:28.819 --> 00:01:28.829 
can see here it says recycle so you this

00:01:28.829 --> 00:01:32.359 
can see here it says recycle so you this
is<00:01:28.890> recyclable<00:01:29.549> of<00:01:29.729> course<00:01:29.970> and<00:01:31.189> so<00:01:32.189> if<00:01:32.280> it

00:01:32.359 --> 00:01:32.369 
is recyclable of course and so if it

00:01:32.369 --> 00:01:36.800 
is recyclable of course and so if it
ever<00:01:32.460> runs<00:01:33.090> if<00:01:33.450> it<00:01:33.600> ever<00:01:33.780> goes<00:01:33.900> bad<00:01:34.170> or<00:01:34.200> is<00:01:35.810> just

00:01:36.800 --> 00:01:36.810 
ever runs if it ever goes bad or is just

00:01:36.810 --> 00:01:38.240 
ever runs if it ever goes bad or is just
not<00:01:37.229> very<00:01:37.259> good<00:01:37.530> anymore

00:01:38.240 --> 00:01:38.250 
not very good anymore

00:01:38.250 --> 00:01:40.460 
not very good anymore
you'll<00:01:38.759> always<00:01:38.909> recycle<00:01:39.329> it<00:01:39.570> and<00:01:39.600> these<00:01:40.320> are

00:01:40.460 --> 00:01:40.470 
you'll always recycle it and these are

00:01:40.470 --> 00:01:43.460 
you'll always recycle it and these are
not<00:01:40.619> hard<00:01:40.950> to<00:01:41.100> find<00:01:41.280> or<00:01:41.750> that<00:01:42.750> expensive<00:01:43.290> so

00:01:43.460 --> 00:01:43.470 
not hard to find or that expensive so

00:01:43.470 --> 00:01:47.660 
not hard to find or that expensive so
you<00:01:44.430> can<00:01:44.790> always<00:01:44.909> get<00:01:45.060> a<00:01:45.119> replacement<00:01:45.390> and<00:01:46.670> it

00:01:47.660 --> 00:01:47.670 
you can always get a replacement and it

00:01:47.670 --> 00:01:51.560 
you can always get a replacement and it
gets<00:01:48.090> good<00:01:48.270> battery<00:01:48.689> life<00:01:48.899> I<00:01:49.079> think<00:01:50.329> so

00:01:51.560 --> 00:01:51.570 
gets good battery life I think so

00:01:51.570 --> 00:01:54.170 
gets good battery life I think so
and<00:01:51.659> this<00:01:52.649> is<00:01:52.799> for<00:01:52.979> a<00:01:53.009> tripod<00:01:53.399> connection

00:01:54.170 --> 00:01:54.180

00:03:01.910 --> 00:03:01.920 
and off oh is stands for optical image

00:03:01.920 --> 00:03:04.550 
and off oh is stands for optical image
stabilization<00:03:02.400> and<00:03:02.880> that<00:03:03.420> helps<00:03:03.690> for<00:03:03.930> those

00:03:04.550 --> 00:03:04.560 
stabilization and that helps for those

00:03:04.560 --> 00:03:09.500

00:03:11.090 --> 00:03:11.100 
helps for when you're zooming in really

00:03:11.100 --> 00:03:15.410 
helps for when you're zooming in really
far<00:03:11.310> and<00:03:12.800> this<00:03:13.800> is<00:03:13.950> how<00:03:14.070> you<00:03:14.130> zoom<00:03:14.580> right<00:03:15.000> here

00:03:15.420 --> 00:03:18.440 
far and this is how you zoom right here
and<00:03:15.630> also<00:03:16.380> how<00:03:16.740> you<00:03:16.800> turn<00:03:17.160> the<00:03:17.340> volume<00:03:17.370> up<00:03:18.209> or

you've<00:03:21.480> already<00:03:21.690> taken<00:03:21.959> and<00:03:22.820> so<00:03:23.820> that's<00:03:24.000> a

00:03:24.080 --> 00:03:24.090 
you've already taken and so that's a

00:03:24.090 --> 00:03:28.330 
you've already taken and so that's a
nice<00:03:24.240> feature<00:03:24.450> here<00:03:25.550> on<00:03:26.550> the<00:03:26.730> front<00:03:27.090> we<00:03:27.810> have

00:03:28.330 --> 00:03:28.340 
nice feature here on the front we have

00:03:32.400 --> 00:03:35.090 
the lens and this is the lens cap open
and<00:03:32.520> closer<00:03:32.760> and<00:03:33.690> so<00:03:34.380> you<00:03:34.440> just<00:03:34.620> slide<00:03:34.920> it<00:03:35.070> down

about<00:04:05.970> the<00:04:06.150> specs<00:04:06.450> here<00:04:06.989> it's<00:04:07.260> a<00:04:07.560> standard

00:04:08.210 --> 00:04:08.220 
about the specs here it's a standard

about the specs here it's a standard
definition<00:04:08.489> camcorder<00:04:09.209> but<00:04:09.810> you<00:04:10.739> know

00:04:10.850 --> 00:04:10.860 
definition camcorder but you know

00:04:10.860 --> 00:04:12.650 
definition camcorder but you know
high-definition<00:04:11.730> isn't<00:04:12.150> always<00:04:12.270> what<00:04:12.540> it's

00:04:12.650 --> 00:04:12.660 
high-definition isn't always what it's

00:04:12.660 --> 00:04:14.390 
high-definition isn't always what it's
cracked<00:04:12.720> isn't<00:04:13.470> really<00:04:13.830> what<00:04:13.950> it's<00:04:14.100> cracked

00:04:14.390 --> 00:04:14.400 
cracked isn't really what it's cracked

00:04:14.400 --> 00:04:17.870 
cracked isn't really what it's cracked
up<00:04:14.640> to<00:04:14.700> be<00:04:15.260> what<00:04:16.260> they<00:04:16.440> say<00:04:17.430> it's<00:04:17.669> all<00:04:17.850> about

00:04:17.870 --> 00:04:17.880 
up to be what they say it's all about

00:04:17.880 --> 00:04:20.900 
up to be what they say it's all about
you<00:04:18.239> know<00:04:18.270> so<00:04:19.049> standard<00:04:19.710> definition<00:04:20.250> is

00:04:20.900 --> 00:04:20.910 
you know so standard definition is

00:04:20.910 --> 00:04:24.650 
you know so standard definition is
plenty<00:04:21.720> enough<00:04:21.870> for<00:04:22.290> me<00:04:23.430> it's<00:04:23.790> got<00:04:24.000> 70<00:04:24.420> times

00:04:24.650 --> 00:04:24.660 
plenty enough for me it's got 70 times

00:04:24.660 --> 00:04:29.060 
plenty enough for me it's got 70 times
optical<00:04:25.200> zoom<00:04:25.230> which<00:04:25.860> is<00:04:26.270> on<00:04:27.270> the<00:04:27.890> really<00:04:28.890> high

00:04:29.060 --> 00:04:29.070 
optical zoom which is on the really high

00:04:29.070 --> 00:04:36.020 
optical zoom which is on the really high
for<00:04:29.130> its<00:04:29.730> price<00:04:30.060> and<00:04:33.170> 35<00:04:34.170> or<00:04:34.500> 35<00:04:35.280> hundred<00:04:35.730> times

00:04:36.020 --> 00:04:36.030 
for its price and 35 or 35 hundred times

00:04:36.030 --> 00:04:41.300 
for its price and 35 or 35 hundred times
digital<00:04:36.600> zoom<00:04:37.940> it<00:04:38.940> has<00:04:39.660> I<00:04:39.930> a<00:04:40.500> which<00:04:40.920> stands<00:04:41.190> for

00:04:41.300 --> 00:04:41.310 
digital zoom it has I a which stands for

00:04:41.310 --> 00:04:45.170 
digital zoom it has I a which stands for
intelligent<00:04:42.150> Auto<00:04:42.360> and<00:04:43.340> what<00:04:44.340> that<00:04:44.550> does<00:04:44.790> is<00:04:45.150> a

00:04:45.170 --> 00:04:45.180 
intelligent Auto and what that does is a

00:04:45.180 --> 00:04:47.930 
intelligent Auto and what that does is a
face<00:04:45.780> detection<00:04:46.260> scene<00:04:46.830> selector<00:04:47.460> and<00:04:47.730> a

00:04:47.930 --> 00:04:47.940 
face detection scene selector and a

00:04:47.940 --> 00:04:54.860 
face detection scene selector and a
contrast<00:04:51.140> leveler<00:04:52.160> what<00:04:53.160> it<00:04:53.280> does<00:04:53.490> for<00:04:54.420> what

00:04:54.860 --> 00:04:54.870 
contrast leveler what it does for what

00:04:54.870 --> 00:04:57.050 
contrast leveler what it does for what
the<00:04:54.990> all<00:04:55.140> those<00:04:55.410> means<00:04:55.680> is<00:04:55.890> face<00:04:56.190> detection<00:04:56.640> it

00:04:57.050 --> 00:04:57.060 
the all those means is face detection it

install it on my 64-bit computer and it
did<00:06:21.300> not<00:06:21.450> work<00:06:21.950> so<00:06:22.950> well<00:06:23.520> it<00:06:23.700> would<00:06:24.030> install

00:06:24.409 --> 00:06:24.419 
did not work so well it would install

00:06:24.419 --> 00:06:26.450
