but this one really caught my eye it's a
lot<00:00:20.310> smaller<00:00:20.730> than<00:00:20.970> I<00:00:21.090> thought<00:00:21.300> would<00:00:21.510> be<00:00:21.539> as

00:00:52.250 --> 00:00:52.260 
can see you pull out the sides comes all

00:00:52.260 --> 00:00:58.670 
can see you pull out the sides comes all
the<00:00:52.320> way<00:00:52.379> out<00:00:52.469> there<00:00:52.800> and<00:00:57.020> should<00:00:58.020> come<00:00:58.350> out

00:00:58.670 --> 00:00:58.680 
the way out there and should come out

00:00:58.680 --> 00:01:02.270 
the way out there and should come out
here<00:01:00.109> there<00:01:01.109> we<00:01:01.230> go<00:01:01.440> it's<00:01:01.859> kind<00:01:02.070> of<00:01:02.100> tricky

00:01:02.270 --> 00:01:02.280 
here there we go it's kind of tricky

00:01:02.280 --> 00:01:11.240 
here there we go it's kind of tricky
actually<00:01:04.400> and<00:01:07.400> so<00:01:08.400> it<00:01:08.490> looks<00:01:09.979> comes<00:01:10.979> with<00:01:11.159> some

00:01:11.240 --> 00:01:11.250 
actually and so it looks comes with some

00:01:11.250 --> 00:01:12.980 
actually and so it looks comes with some
little<00:01:11.400> applicators<00:01:12.119> that<00:01:12.420> I<00:01:12.450> would<00:01:12.780> never

00:01:12.980 --> 00:01:12.990 
little applicators that I would never

00:01:12.990 --> 00:01:15.469 
little applicators that I would never
use<00:01:13.290> in<00:01:13.500> a<00:01:13.560> million<00:01:13.799> years<00:01:14.240> little<00:01:15.240> sponge

00:01:15.469 --> 00:01:15.479 
use in a million years little sponge

00:01:15.479 --> 00:01:17.090 
use in a million years little sponge
applicators<00:01:16.140> and<00:01:16.200> I<00:01:16.470> think<00:01:16.680> that's<00:01:16.860> a<00:01:16.950> lip

00:01:17.090 --> 00:01:17.100 
applicators and I think that's a lip

00:01:17.100 --> 00:01:19.270 
applicators and I think that's a lip
lining<00:01:17.460> breath<00:01:17.640> all<00:01:17.850> right<00:01:17.970> lip<00:01:18.150> gloss<00:01:18.570> brush

00:01:19.270 --> 00:01:19.280 
lining breath all right lip gloss brush

00:01:19.280 --> 00:01:21.530 
lining breath all right lip gloss brush
but<00:01:20.280> I<00:01:20.520> think<00:01:20.820> they<00:01:20.909> expect<00:01:21.240> that<00:01:21.299> you<00:01:21.420> already

00:01:21.530 --> 00:01:21.540 
but I think they expect that you already

00:01:21.540 --> 00:01:26.480 
but I think they expect that you already
have<00:01:21.750> your<00:01:21.869> own<00:01:21.960> brushes<00:01:22.200> anyway<00:01:22.650> so<00:01:25.310> yeah<00:01:26.310> so

00:01:26.480 --> 00:01:26.490 
have your own brushes anyway so yeah so

00:01:26.490 --> 00:01:27.740 
have your own brushes anyway so yeah so
if<00:01:26.580> you<00:01:26.640> see<00:01:26.850> where<00:01:26.939> my<00:01:26.970> hand<00:01:27.270> is

00:01:27.740 --> 00:01:27.750 
if you see where my hand is

00:01:27.750 --> 00:01:29.630 
if you see where my hand is
this<00:01:27.900> kind<00:01:28.200> of<00:01:28.290> shows<00:01:28.500> you<00:01:28.650> what<00:01:28.799> size<00:01:28.979> is<00:01:29.310> and

00:01:29.630 --> 00:01:29.640
