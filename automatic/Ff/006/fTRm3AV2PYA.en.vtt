00:00:13.910 --> 00:00:18.650
 water sun channel video 

00:00:16.520 --> 00:00:20.270
 and this time the video is about 

00:00:18.650 --> 00:00:22.270
 a 

00:00:20.270 --> 00:00:26.550
 a box 

00:00:22.270 --> 00:00:28.780
 as they are set today, August 20 and 4 

00:00:26.550 --> 00:00:31.570
 We went with a little box that came to me 

00:00:28.780 --> 00:00:34.420
 several days take mail in santiago de 

00:00:31.570 --> 00:00:36.370
 a purchase that I made on ebay and that was 

00:00:34.420 --> 00:00:38.490
 waiting a long time ago and that is like a 

00:00:36.370 --> 00:00:40.530
 kind of longing 

00:00:38.490 --> 00:00:43.830
 I had at least four 

00:00:40.530 --> 00:00:46.460
 years of buying me this is an article 

00:00:43.830 --> 00:00:50.520
 used is an accessory 

00:00:46.460 --> 00:00:54.060
 so come with me to have it coming 

00:00:50.520 --> 00:00:56.580
 already with the faithful help 

00:00:54.060 --> 00:00:59.160
 to compute still cut cardboard as they were 

00:00:56.580 --> 00:01:01.160
 can call stimulus in the peek 

00:00:59.160 --> 00:01:04.170
 this new 

00:01:01.160 --> 00:01:06.769
 buy tell me 

00:01:04.170 --> 00:01:06.769
 carefully 

00:01:13.050 --> 00:01:18.740
 what I buy good surely already be 

00:01:15.840 --> 00:01:18.740
 watching the title the video 

00:01:18.760 --> 00:01:24.430
 I bought it used because it went much more to 

00:01:22.360 --> 00:01:26.740
 accounts and if I'm not wrong now 

00:01:24.430 --> 00:01:30.220
 checking the computer what I bought 

00:01:26.740 --> 00:01:31.700
 it came out by how much 

00:01:30.220 --> 00:01:35.439
 as for 

00:01:31.700 --> 00:01:35.439
 eleven thousand twelve thousand chilean pesos 

00:01:36.229 --> 00:01:41.860
 this was in a video a bet 

00:01:38.890 --> 00:01:43.870
 share what you would say 

00:01:41.860 --> 00:01:49.020
 It has quite wrapped up because it comes from 

00:01:43.870 --> 00:01:49.020
 us 045 week to arrive 

00:01:50.990 --> 00:01:56.200
 and well wrapped in many papers has 

00:01:53.810 --> 00:01:56.200
 this columnist 

00:01:58.150 --> 00:02:04.330
 comes with a stake I buy it 

00:02:02.510 --> 00:02:08.220
 and records 

00:02:04.330 --> 00:02:08.220
 that the seller's name would be 

00:02:10.080 --> 00:02:15.780
 and street records free status and there it is 

00:02:13.740 --> 00:02:16.950
 the store where I just bought it and in 

00:02:15.780 --> 00:02:22.400
 this store sells in different 

00:02:16.950 --> 00:02:24.709
 accessories and music discs 

00:02:22.400 --> 00:02:27.349
 it's still great that they are bad 

00:02:24.709 --> 00:02:31.540
 small pieces of paper and some 

00:02:27.349 --> 00:02:31.540
 california american newspapers 

00:02:33.040 --> 00:02:38.730
 and let's see the star of the video the time 

00:02:38.970 --> 00:02:44.400
 and the star is he 

00:02:41.710 --> 00:02:44.400
 will be 

00:02:44.660 --> 00:02:48.020
 how they are fixed 

00:02:48.030 --> 00:02:58.099
 He sent for a good attempt 

00:02:53.930 --> 00:03:00.819
 keep or tell me to ask for one as 

00:02:58.099 --> 00:03:03.069
 it's called a waiver 

00:03:00.819 --> 00:03:06.730
 that are fixed there goes out 

00:03:03.069 --> 00:03:10.870
 waivers that is the wireless control of 

00:03:06.730 --> 00:03:12.909
 the people and how do they set this control 

00:03:10.870 --> 00:03:16.019
 I tried it when I was studying in Valparaíso 

00:03:12.909 --> 00:03:20.430
 and once in falabella someone tried 

00:03:16.019 --> 00:03:23.889
 to play your movie and buy it now 

00:03:20.430 --> 00:03:27.790
 how do they look at technology of the day in 

00:03:23.889 --> 00:03:29.590
 that we have buttons tyler the zeta 

00:03:27.790 --> 00:03:35.109
 the mythical jump that is born in the 

00:03:29.590 --> 00:03:38.439
 nintendo 64 the xl and the by in the opinion 

00:03:35.109 --> 00:03:40.510
 staff this control is great if 

00:03:38.439 --> 00:03:42.430
 would have added as a set to 2 or another 

00:03:40.510 --> 00:03:45.819
 button the future box would be remarkable 

00:03:42.430 --> 00:03:48.360
 because very comfortable is very intuitive is 

00:03:45.819 --> 00:03:52.550
 wireless already 

00:03:48.360 --> 00:03:52.550
 and they will correct 

00:03:54.120 --> 00:03:59.959
 to do to make the operation 

00:03:56.370 --> 00:03:59.959
 wireless we need this 

00:04:00.340 --> 00:04:05.360
 how they are fixed 

00:04:02.870 --> 00:04:07.700
 is a solve camera is a little bit 

00:04:05.360 --> 00:04:10.450
 little pig and that inner clean is a 

00:04:07.700 --> 00:04:10.450
 receiver 

00:04:10.680 --> 00:04:17.109
 wireless this connects well in the 

00:04:14.470 --> 00:04:19.600
 nintendo wii after you choose the channel 

00:04:17.109 --> 00:04:23.350
 the camera 

00:04:19.600 --> 00:04:27.280
 there is a little wheel and then you 

00:04:23.350 --> 00:04:31.690
 how is your web called and synchronize with 

00:04:27.280 --> 00:04:36.670
 him with the console as you can see 

00:04:31.690 --> 00:04:38.260
 also uses two batteries double to me 

00:04:36.670 --> 00:04:40.210
 I had made a mistake and I had put it 

00:04:38.260 --> 00:04:41.780
 bought wanted to buy 100 batteries 

00:04:40.210 --> 00:04:45.080
 triple 

00:04:41.780 --> 00:04:48.009
 but how do you fix these the cap is 

00:04:45.080 --> 00:04:52.569
 it was out there 

00:04:48.009 --> 00:04:54.550
 as it is set in this room to learn and 

00:04:52.569 --> 00:04:57.550
 surely if I had this connected in 

00:04:54.550 --> 00:04:59.830
 the wiki or someone that this would start to 

00:04:57.550 --> 00:05:02.300
 synchronize like when we synchronize the 

00:04:59.830 --> 00:05:04.650
 the 

00:05:02.300 --> 00:05:09.030
 as if when we synchronize the wii with 

00:05:04.650 --> 00:05:11.050
 or wimax very well let's make a 

00:05:09.030 --> 00:05:14.080
 small comparison 

00:05:11.050 --> 00:05:15.550
 I have no control of the original entity but 

00:05:14.080 --> 00:05:17.620
 I have an alternative and can we 

00:05:15.550 --> 00:05:21.970
 show below 

00:05:17.620 --> 00:05:25.000
 ok I already found my control that this one 

00:05:21.970 --> 00:05:27.130
 alternative that was a control like 

00:05:25.000 --> 00:05:28.720
 they fix a pretty long cable that I 

00:05:27.130 --> 00:05:31.360
 I always hope you have found it in 

00:05:28.720 --> 00:05:32.440
 toy stores used in the 

00:05:31.360 --> 00:05:34.720
 anatolia 

00:05:32.440 --> 00:05:38.430
 America and we are going to set up the 

00:05:34.720 --> 00:05:43.900
 wiring we already have connector and this 

00:05:38.430 --> 00:05:47.729
 control of who a cable or brand is 

00:05:43.900 --> 00:05:50.590
 matt capps and is a very good brand of 

00:05:47.729 --> 00:05:53.110
 control of gamecube alternatives how 

00:05:50.590 --> 00:05:56.199
 you can fix it even if you have 

00:05:53.110 --> 00:06:00.550
 up to a turbo or automatic button 

00:05:56.199 --> 00:06:03.430
 and theater colon here already has vibration 

00:06:00.550 --> 00:06:06.060
 everything but how it was to stick everything 

00:06:03.430 --> 00:06:06.060
 they can give an account 

00:06:06.820 --> 00:06:15.920
 is a little bit wider here and a little 

00:06:12.200 --> 00:06:19.010
 heavier because by putting two batteries 

00:06:15.920 --> 00:06:25.180
 double to it becomes quite heavy but it is 

00:06:19.010 --> 00:06:25.180
 Quite comfortable and intuitive connection 

00:06:25.600 --> 00:06:31.630
 very well I hope it is a box that 

00:06:28.450 --> 00:06:35.740
 I think it came out pretty short 

00:06:31.630 --> 00:06:37.230
 thank you here I leave the new member 

00:06:35.740 --> 00:06:40.230
 from me 

00:06:37.230 --> 00:06:43.070
 of my consoles that is to take advantage of 

00:06:40.230 --> 00:06:43.070
 well the clean 

00:06:44.560 --> 00:06:49.139
 I hope you are very well let's run 

00:06:46.480 --> 00:06:49.139
 why 

00:06:49.620 --> 00:06:57.540
 and as you look at the caste I finally have 

00:06:53.070 --> 00:06:59.699
 a control of the original waiver used 

00:06:57.540 --> 00:07:01.970
 but in good condition the movies 

00:06:59.699 --> 00:07:01.970
 excellent 

00:07:02.060 --> 00:07:08.900
 to be able to play wirelessly 

00:07:05.980 --> 00:07:10.730
 the channels of the nintendo wii as to its 

00:07:08.900 --> 00:07:13.040
 many games like the smart crowder 

00:07:10.730 --> 00:07:15.139
 like gamecube games like the 

00:07:13.040 --> 00:07:16.940
 james cook materials fight games 

00:07:15.139 --> 00:07:20.020
 so we're going to character the game to 

00:07:16.940 --> 00:07:23.139
 this and enjoy the web a lot 

00:07:20.020 --> 00:07:25.629
 well a big hug every time of santiago 

00:07:23.139 --> 00:07:27.400
 of chile and keep watching more videos 

00:07:25.629 --> 00:07:32.770
 boxing and surprises that come here in 

00:07:27.400 --> 00:07:36.400
 the channel of solá with the channel of the júcar 

00:07:32.770 --> 00:07:39.060
 be careful that they are super well 

00:07:36.400 --> 00:07:39.060
 goodbye
