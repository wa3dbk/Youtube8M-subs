00:01:50.400 --> 00:01:52.950 
that is where the fares get their energy
from

00:01:52.950 --> 00:01:52.960 

00:01:52.960 --> 00:01:54.780 

but<00:01:53.530> let's<00:01:53.650> do<00:01:53.770> can<00:01:54.040> look<00:01:54.190> at<00:01:54.280> the<00:01:54.370> magnetic

00:01:54.780 --> 00:01:54.790 
but let's do can look at the magnetic

00:01:54.790 --> 00:01:58.109 
but let's do can look at the magnetic

into<00:02:05.740> the<00:02:05.860> Sun<00:02:06.450> the<00:02:07.450> region<00:02:07.750> that<00:02:07.840> produced

00:02:08.160 --> 00:02:08.170 
into the Sun the region that produced

00:02:08.170 --> 00:02:09.930 
into the Sun the region that produced
the<00:02:08.229> flare<00:02:08.530> is<00:02:08.740> just<00:02:08.979> below<00:02:09.130> and<00:02:09.580> to<00:02:09.729> the<00:02:09.759> right

00:02:09.930 --> 00:02:09.940 
the flare is just below and to the right

00:02:09.940 --> 00:02:12.660 
the flare is just below and to the right

00:02:12.670 --> 00:02:13.740 
of Sun Center which is far larger and
more<00:02:12.730> complex<00:02:12.790> than<00:02:13.239> any<00:02:13.420> of<00:02:13.540> the<00:02:13.630> other

00:02:13.740 --> 00:02:13.750 
more complex than any of the other

00:02:13.750 --> 00:02:18.390 
more complex than any of the other
regions<00:02:15.030> as<00:02:16.770> we<00:02:17.770> move<00:02:17.950> up<00:02:18.069> in<00:02:18.220> the<00:02:18.310> atmosphere

00:02:18.390 --> 00:02:18.400 
regions as we move up in the atmosphere

00:02:18.400 --> 00:02:21.420 
regions as we move up in the atmosphere
we<00:02:18.850> go<00:02:19.000> to<00:02:19.060> higher<00:02:19.330> temperatures<00:02:20.130> the<00:02:21.130> active

00:02:21.420 --> 00:02:21.430 
we go to higher temperatures the active

00:02:21.430 --> 00:02:23.130 
we go to higher temperatures the active
region<00:02:21.520> that<00:02:21.819> produced<00:02:22.150> the<00:02:22.270> flare<00:02:22.569> gets

00:02:23.130 --> 00:02:23.140 
region that produced the flare gets

00:02:23.140 --> 00:02:24.630 
region that produced the flare gets
proportionately<00:02:23.680> larger<00:02:24.160> as<00:02:24.310> we<00:02:24.430> go<00:02:24.580> to

00:02:24.630 --> 00:02:24.640 
proportionately larger as we go to

higher temperature euv emission lines

00:02:26.760 --> 00:02:28.920 
higher temperature euv emission lines
that<00:02:27.760> means<00:02:28.030> that<00:02:28.150> the<00:02:28.300> region<00:02:28.630> is<00:02:28.750> much

00:02:28.920 --> 00:02:28.930 
that means that the region is much

00:02:28.930 --> 00:02:30.240 
that means that the region is much
hotter<00:02:29.140> and<00:02:29.410> more<00:02:29.530> active<00:02:29.920> than<00:02:29.950> the<00:02:30.130> other

00:02:30.240 --> 00:02:30.250 
hotter and more active than the other

00:02:30.250 --> 00:02:36.850 
hotter and more active than the other
regions

00:02:36.850 --> 00:02:36.860 

00:02:36.860 --> 00:02:39.370 

the<00:02:37.820> reason<00:02:38.150> for<00:02:38.300> all<00:02:38.330> this<00:02:38.540> activity<00:02:38.870> is<00:02:39.110> that

00:02:39.370 --> 00:02:39.380 
the reason for all this activity is that

00:02:39.380 --> 00:02:41.170 
the reason for all this activity is that
sunspots<00:02:39.770> emerged<00:02:40.040> so<00:02:40.220> quickly<00:02:40.640> agreed<00:02:41.000> to<00:02:41.090> be

00:02:41.170 --> 00:02:41.180 
sunspots emerged so quickly agreed to be

00:02:41.180 --> 00:02:51.559 
sunspots emerged so quickly agreed to be
tens<00:02:41.390> of<00:02:41.510> thousands<00:02:41.900> of<00:02:41.960> kilometers<00:02:42.410> across

if<00:02:54.130> you<00:02:54.250> remember<00:02:54.400> correctly<00:02:54.730> is<00:02:55.150> in<00:02:55.330> what

00:02:55.440 --> 00:02:55.450 
if you remember correctly is in what

00:02:55.450 --> 00:02:57.900 
if you remember correctly is in what
sunspots<00:02:55.990> are<00:02:56.280> Lisa's<00:02:57.280> huge<00:02:57.550> amounts<00:02:57.850> of

let's<00:03:02.380> see<00:03:02.680> what<00:03:02.830> flair<00:03:03.160> look<00:03:03.190> like<00:03:03.550> in<00:03:03.760> the

let's see what flair look like in the

00:03:03.790 --> 00:03:06.420 
let's see what flair look like in the
solar<00:03:04.090> corona<00:03:04.590> here<00:03:05.590> we<00:03:05.680> see<00:03:05.800> the<00:03:05.830> sun's<00:03:06.130> outer

any<00:03:11.319> time<00:03:11.470> soon<00:03:11.920> you<00:03:12.790> can<00:03:12.940> see<00:03:13.060> the<00:03:13.150> bubble<00:03:13.390> of

gas coming straight at us if you look

00:03:14.950 --> 00:03:19.020 
gas coming straight at us if you look
carefully<00:03:16.680> well<00:03:17.680> lastly<00:03:18.100> that<00:03:18.280> blue<00:03:18.550> image<00:03:18.850> I

00:03:19.020 --> 00:03:19.030 
carefully well lastly that blue image I

00:03:19.030 --> 00:03:21.060 
carefully well lastly that blue image I
showed<00:03:19.060> at<00:03:19.420> the<00:03:19.450> beginning<00:03:19.540> before<00:03:20.410> the<00:03:20.739> UFO

of spacecraft silhouetted by a bright
flare<00:03:24.760> this<00:03:25.570> is<00:03:25.720> an<00:03:25.810> artifact<00:03:26.260> of<00:03:26.350> the

which<00:03:28.930> you<00:03:29.019> normally<00:03:29.140> can't<00:03:29.470> detect<00:03:29.860> but<00:03:30.850> as

00:03:30.960 --> 00:03:30.970 
which you normally can't detect but as

00:03:30.970 --> 00:03:32.729 
which you normally can't detect but as
the<00:03:31.120> fair<00:03:31.330> is<00:03:31.360> so<00:03:31.570> bright<00:03:31.810> the<00:03:32.110> light<00:03:32.140> bounces

00:03:32.729 --> 00:03:32.739 
the fair is so bright the light bounces

00:03:32.739 --> 00:03:34.530 
the fair is so bright the light bounces
around<00:03:32.860> many<00:03:33.280> time<00:03:33.610> so<00:03:33.910> we<00:03:34.030> get<00:03:34.180> lots<00:03:34.300> of<00:03:34.450> the
