in making iced tea I think you can see
in<00:01:14.030> the<00:01:14.149> reflection<00:01:14.600> that<00:01:14.990> both<00:01:15.200> the<00:01:15.830> words

00:01:16.090 --> 00:01:16.100 
in the reflection that both the words

00:01:16.100 --> 00:01:19.510 
in the reflection that both the words
and<00:01:16.580> the<00:01:16.610> drawing<00:01:17.600> were<00:01:18.290> traced<00:01:18.860> onto<00:01:19.160> acetate

00:01:19.510 --> 00:01:19.520 
and the drawing were traced onto acetate

00:01:19.520 --> 00:01:23.170 
and the drawing were traced onto acetate
after<00:01:20.420> i<00:01:20.450> did<00:01:20.840> a<00:01:21.080> little<00:01:21.380> bit<00:01:21.950> of<00:01:22.180> computer

00:01:23.170 --> 00:01:23.180 
after i did a little bit of computer

00:01:23.180 --> 00:01:26.740 
after i did a little bit of computer
editing<00:01:23.330> with<00:01:24.289> my<00:01:24.530> computer<00:01:24.979> and<00:01:25.570> in<00:01:26.570> each

00:01:26.740 --> 00:01:26.750 
editing with my computer and in each

00:01:26.750 --> 00:01:29.560 
editing with my computer and in each
case<00:01:26.780> i've<00:01:27.440> used<00:01:27.920> fabric<00:01:28.430> collage<00:01:28.940> to<00:01:29.300> try<00:01:29.510> to

case i've used fabric collage to try to
enhance<00:01:30.020> the<00:01:30.619> drawing<00:01:30.950> but<00:01:31.369> not<00:01:31.640> detract<00:01:32.299> from

00:01:32.380 --> 00:01:32.390

some<00:02:58.940> big<00:02:59.480> French<00:03:00.019> nuts<00:03:00.350> and<00:03:00.680> they<00:03:01.220> kind<00:03:01.430> of

00:03:01.539 --> 00:03:01.549 
some big French nuts and they kind of

00:03:01.549 --> 00:03:03.699 
some big French nuts and they kind of
enhance<00:03:02.030> the<00:03:02.269> little<00:03:02.510> grounds<00:03:03.140> that<00:03:03.349> are<00:03:03.470> left

00:03:03.709 --> 00:03:09.759 
enhance the little grounds that are left
right<00:03:04.010> there<00:03:04.280> on<00:03:04.489> the<00:03:04.549> tea<00:03:05.420> bags<00:03:08.769> continuing

00:03:09.759 --> 00:03:09.769 
right there on the tea bags continuing

00:03:09.769 --> 00:03:13.270 
right there on the tea bags continuing
on<00:03:09.920> again<00:03:10.340> I<00:03:10.750> wanted<00:03:11.750> the<00:03:12.079> fabric<00:03:12.920> and<00:03:13.100> the

00:03:13.270 --> 00:03:13.280 
on again I wanted the fabric and the

00:03:13.280 --> 00:03:15.610 
on again I wanted the fabric and the
drawings<00:03:13.820> to<00:03:14.120> enhance<00:03:14.660> one<00:03:14.900> another<00:03:15.170> but<00:03:15.380> not

00:03:15.610 --> 00:03:15.620 
drawings to enhance one another but not

00:03:15.620 --> 00:03:26.890 
drawings to enhance one another but not
be<00:03:16.060> exactly<00:03:17.060> identical<00:03:20.650> more<00:03:21.650> French<00:03:22.040> nuts

00:03:26.890 --> 00:03:26.900 

00:03:26.900 --> 00:03:30.470 

and<00:03:27.900> continuing<00:03:28.620> on<00:03:28.800> the<00:03:29.460> acetate<00:03:30.120> stitched

00:03:30.470 --> 00:03:30.480 
and continuing on the acetate stitched

00:03:30.480 --> 00:03:33.020 
and continuing on the acetate stitched
down<00:03:30.750> in<00:03:30.960> this<00:03:31.080> fashion<00:03:31.380> is<00:03:31.770> actually<00:03:32.280> plan<00:03:32.640> B

00:03:33.020 --> 00:03:33.030 
down in this fashion is actually plan B

00:03:33.030 --> 00:03:35.050 
down in this fashion is actually plan B
but<00:03:33.750> I'm<00:03:33.870> quite<00:03:34.140> happy<00:03:34.320> with<00:03:34.530> it<00:03:34.800> and<00:03:34.950> the

00:03:35.050 --> 00:03:35.060 
but I'm quite happy with it and the

00:03:35.060 --> 00:03:38.690 
but I'm quite happy with it and the
drawing<00:03:36.060> was<00:03:36.330> plan<00:03:36.720> B<00:03:37.200> also<00:03:37.950> I<00:03:37.980> initially

00:03:38.690 --> 00:03:38.700 
drawing was plan B also I initially

00:03:38.700 --> 00:03:41.330 
drawing was plan B also I initially
intended<00:03:39.060> to<00:03:39.810> print<00:03:40.110> out<00:03:40.260> photos<00:03:40.500> onto<00:03:41.130> the

00:03:41.330 --> 00:03:41.340 
intended to print out photos onto the

00:03:41.340 --> 00:03:43.750 
intended to print out photos onto the
acetate<00:03:41.910> but<00:03:42.120> I<00:03:42.150> really<00:03:42.450> like<00:03:42.630> the<00:03:42.780> hand-drawn

00:03:43.750 --> 00:03:43.760 
acetate but I really like the hand-drawn

00:03:43.760 --> 00:03:48.640 
acetate but I really like the hand-drawn
aspect<00:03:44.760> of<00:03:44.940> this<00:03:46.520> more<00:03:47.520> machine<00:03:47.970> stitching

00:03:48.640 --> 00:03:48.650

00:03:55.100 --> 00:03:55.110 
okay let me show you about some of the

00:03:55.110 --> 00:03:57.290 
okay let me show you about some of the
techniques<00:03:55.440> that<00:03:55.680> I<00:03:55.800> used<00:03:56.070> in<00:03:56.370> making<00:03:56.940> this

00:03:57.290 --> 00:03:57.300 
techniques that I used in making this

00:03:57.300 --> 00:04:03.080 
techniques that I used in making this
book<00:03:58.100> it<00:03:59.100> started<00:04:00.030> with<00:04:00.830> iced<00:04:01.830> tea<00:04:02.130> bags<00:04:02.370> these

00:04:03.080 --> 00:04:03.090 
book it started with iced tea bags these

00:04:03.090 --> 00:04:06.050 
book it started with iced tea bags these
are<00:04:03.300> simply<00:04:03.660> tea<00:04:04.260> bags<00:04:04.560> left<00:04:05.100> from<00:04:05.520> me<00:04:05.820> making

00:04:06.050 --> 00:04:06.060 
are simply tea bags left from me making

00:04:06.060 --> 00:04:08.270 
are simply tea bags left from me making
my<00:04:06.390> favorite<00:04:06.900> drink<00:04:07.170> of<00:04:07.350> course<00:04:08.010> they<00:04:08.220> were

00:04:08.270 --> 00:04:08.280 
my favorite drink of course they were

00:04:08.280 --> 00:04:11.540 
my favorite drink of course they were
all<00:04:08.520> wrinkled<00:04:09.120> initially<00:04:09.870> I<00:04:10.050> let<00:04:10.620> them<00:04:10.800> dry<00:04:11.160> i

00:04:11.540 --> 00:04:11.550 
all wrinkled initially I let them dry i

00:04:11.550 --> 00:04:15.800 
all wrinkled initially I let them dry i
ironed<00:04:12.209> them<00:04:12.540> and<00:04:12.920> then<00:04:13.920> i<00:04:14.190> coated<00:04:14.610> them<00:04:15.030> both

00:04:15.800 --> 00:04:15.810 
ironed them and then i coated them both

00:04:15.810 --> 00:04:18.800 
ironed them and then i coated them both
front<00:04:16.200> and<00:04:16.410> back<00:04:16.500> with<00:04:17.190> a<00:04:17.430> matte<00:04:17.760> medium<00:04:18.299> this

00:04:18.800 --> 00:04:18.810 
front and back with a matte medium this

00:04:18.810 --> 00:04:21.170 
front and back with a matte medium this
is<00:04:19.019> an<00:04:19.140> artist<00:04:19.620> product<00:04:20.160> and<00:04:20.340> just<00:04:20.910> very

00:04:21.170 --> 00:04:21.180 
is an artist product and just very

00:04:21.180 --> 00:04:24.650 
is an artist product and just very
thinly<00:04:21.690> and<00:04:22.049> that<00:04:22.260> helps<00:04:22.950> to<00:04:23.130> protect<00:04:23.390> the<00:04:24.390> tea

00:04:24.650 --> 00:04:24.660 
thinly and that helps to protect the tea

00:04:24.660 --> 00:04:28.370 
thinly and that helps to protect the tea
bags<00:04:25.220> also<00:04:26.220> as<00:04:26.490> I<00:04:27.150> mentioned<00:04:27.180> earlier<00:04:27.720> I

00:04:28.370 --> 00:04:28.380 
bags also as I mentioned earlier I

00:04:28.380 --> 00:04:32.180 
bags also as I mentioned earlier I
didn't<00:04:29.250> perfectly<00:04:30.240> clean<00:04:30.840> these<00:04:31.140> so<00:04:31.919> perhaps

00:04:32.180 --> 00:04:32.190 
didn't perfectly clean these so perhaps

00:04:32.190 --> 00:04:35.330 
didn't perfectly clean these so perhaps
you<00:04:32.550> can<00:04:32.729> see<00:04:33.090> some<00:04:33.840> grounds<00:04:34.470> there<00:04:34.860> that<00:04:35.220> are

00:04:35.330 --> 00:04:35.340 
you can see some grounds there that are

00:04:35.340 --> 00:04:37.670 
you can see some grounds there that are
left<00:04:35.550> on<00:04:35.910> and<00:04:36.150> the<00:04:36.180> matte<00:04:36.750> medium<00:04:37.020> helps<00:04:37.560> to

00:04:37.670 --> 00:04:37.680 
left on and the matte medium helps to

00:04:37.680 --> 00:04:40.370 
left on and the matte medium helps to
secure<00:04:38.160> those<00:04:38.400> this<00:04:39.390> is<00:04:39.450> what<00:04:39.750> a<00:04:39.780> full-size

00:04:40.370 --> 00:04:40.380 
secure those this is what a full-size

00:04:40.380 --> 00:04:43.310 
secure those this is what a full-size
tea<00:04:40.830> bag<00:04:41.070> looks<00:04:41.460> like<00:04:41.610> and<00:04:42.060> for<00:04:42.690> the<00:04:42.810> purposes

00:04:43.310 --> 00:04:43.320 
tea bag looks like and for the purposes

00:04:43.320 --> 00:04:48.350 
tea bag looks like and for the purposes
of<00:04:43.380> my<00:04:43.919> books<00:04:44.340> I<00:04:45.200> cut<00:04:46.200> them<00:04:46.380> in<00:04:46.530> half<00:04:46.560> and<00:04:47.360> used

00:04:48.350 --> 00:04:48.360 
of my books I cut them in half and used

00:04:48.360 --> 00:04:51.890 
of my books I cut them in half and used
a<00:04:48.660> half<00:04:49.020> tea<00:04:49.350> bag<00:04:49.620> for<00:04:50.070> my<00:04:50.190> pages<00:04:50.729> some<00:04:51.690> of<00:04:51.810> them

00:04:51.890 --> 00:04:51.900 
a half tea bag for my pages some of them

00:04:51.900 --> 00:04:56.570 
a half tea bag for my pages some of them
came<00:04:52.229> out<00:04:52.560> a<00:04:52.590> little<00:04:53.040> bit<00:04:53.220> ragged<00:04:55.280> which<00:04:56.280> i

00:04:56.570 --> 00:04:56.580 
came out a little bit ragged which i

00:04:56.580 --> 00:04:59.360 
came out a little bit ragged which i
think<00:04:56.940> is<00:04:57.210> rather<00:04:57.810> wonderful<00:04:58.410> so<00:04:59.010> I<00:04:59.040> didn't

00:04:59.360 --> 00:04:59.370 
think is rather wonderful so I didn't

00:04:59.370 --> 00:05:01.130 
think is rather wonderful so I didn't
use<00:04:59.490> them<00:04:59.669> in<00:04:59.790> this<00:04:59.940> bag<00:05:00.210> but<00:05:00.510> i'll<00:05:00.630> use<00:05:00.870> them

00:05:01.130 --> 00:05:01.140 
use them in this bag but i'll use them

00:05:01.140 --> 00:05:02.930 
use them in this bag but i'll use them
excuse<00:05:01.770> me<00:05:01.890> in<00:05:02.010> this<00:05:02.190> book<00:05:02.400> i'll<00:05:02.520> use<00:05:02.760> them

00:05:02.930 --> 00:05:02.940 
excuse me in this book i'll use them

00:05:02.940 --> 00:05:04.460 
excuse me in this book i'll use them
somewhere<00:05:03.360> else<00:05:03.510> i<00:05:03.690> think<00:05:03.900> they've<00:05:04.020> got<00:05:04.229> a<00:05:04.260> lot

00:05:04.460 --> 00:05:04.470 
somewhere else i think they've got a lot

00:05:04.470 --> 00:05:07.010 
somewhere else i think they've got a lot
of<00:05:04.500> character<00:05:05.060> it<00:05:06.060> occurred<00:05:06.419> to<00:05:06.450> me<00:05:06.810> that

00:05:07.010 --> 00:05:07.020 
of character it occurred to me that

00:05:07.020 --> 00:05:09.770 
of character it occurred to me that
maybe<00:05:07.229> I<00:05:07.620> should<00:05:08.160> try<00:05:08.820> different<00:05:09.300> types<00:05:09.540> of

00:05:09.770 --> 00:05:09.780 
maybe I should try different types of

00:05:09.780 --> 00:05:12.530 
maybe I should try different types of
iced<00:05:10.110> tea<00:05:10.470> and<00:05:10.710> then<00:05:11.460> different<00:05:11.880> flavors<00:05:12.300> and

00:05:12.530 --> 00:05:12.540 
iced tea and then different flavors and

00:05:12.540 --> 00:05:13.820 
iced tea and then different flavors and
then<00:05:12.720> perhaps<00:05:12.990> i<00:05:13.290> would<00:05:13.350> get<00:05:13.620> different

00:05:13.820 --> 00:05:13.830 
then perhaps i would get different

00:05:13.830 --> 00:05:17.510 
then perhaps i would get different
colors<00:05:14.280> so<00:05:15.030> I<00:05:15.419> did<00:05:15.690> bought<00:05:16.410> a<00:05:16.440> sample<00:05:16.979> pack<00:05:17.220> and

00:05:17.510 --> 00:05:17.520 
colors so I did bought a sample pack and

00:05:17.520 --> 00:05:19.460 
colors so I did bought a sample pack and
tried<00:05:17.760> a<00:05:17.790> few<00:05:18.030> things<00:05:18.090> and<00:05:18.600> threw<00:05:19.140> them<00:05:19.290> all<00:05:19.440> in

00:05:19.460 --> 00:05:19.470 
tried a few things and threw them all in

00:05:19.470 --> 00:05:23.719 
tried a few things and threw them all in
a<00:05:19.710> bowl<00:05:19.890> to<00:05:20.370> to<00:05:21.360> dry<00:05:21.600> out<00:05:21.810> and<00:05:22.080> I<00:05:22.770> did<00:05:23.040> get<00:05:23.490> some

00:05:23.719 --> 00:05:23.729 
a bowl to to dry out and I did get some
