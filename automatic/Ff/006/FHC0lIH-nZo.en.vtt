pieces to show it to you and when you

00:00:20.710 --> 00:00:22.140 
pieces to show it to you and when you
are<00:00:20.920> pulling<00:00:21.250> this<00:00:21.400> thing<00:00:21.580> together<00:00:21.760> it's

00:00:22.140 --> 00:00:22.150 
are pulling this thing together it's

00:00:22.150 --> 00:00:25.020 
are pulling this thing together it's
important<00:00:22.900> to<00:00:23.050> remember<00:00:23.560> and<00:00:23.770> track<00:00:24.130> which<00:00:24.760> of

these cables is going to which ESC in
which<00:00:27.699> motor<00:00:27.970> and<00:00:28.300> that<00:00:28.810> sounds<00:00:29.170> like<00:00:29.289> it's

00:00:29.490 --> 00:00:29.500 
which motor and that sounds like it's

00:00:29.500 --> 00:00:30.900 
which motor and that sounds like it's
very<00:00:29.710> straightforward<00:00:30.010> and<00:00:30.610> you're<00:00:30.699> never

00:00:30.900 --> 00:00:30.910 
very straightforward and you're never

00:00:30.910 --> 00:00:32.639 
very straightforward and you're never
going<00:00:31.090> to<00:00:31.119> have<00:00:31.210> a<00:00:31.270> problem<00:00:31.539> with<00:00:31.869> that<00:00:32.050> but

00:00:32.639 --> 00:00:32.649 
going to have a problem with that but

00:00:32.649 --> 00:00:34.290 
going to have a problem with that but
I've<00:00:32.829> done<00:00:33.070> it<00:00:33.219> once<00:00:33.399> oh<00:00:33.579> it's<00:00:33.730> amazing<00:00:34.149> how

00:00:34.290 --> 00:00:34.300 
I've done it once oh it's amazing how

00:00:34.300 --> 00:00:37.170 
I've done it once oh it's amazing how
many<00:00:34.539> questions<00:00:34.780> I<00:00:35.109> get<00:00:35.410> where<00:00:36.039> as<00:00:36.550> two<00:00:36.880> of

00:00:37.170 --> 00:00:37.180 
many questions I get where as two of

00:00:37.180 --> 00:00:39.120 
many questions I get where as two of
these<00:00:37.360> leads<00:00:37.720> have<00:00:38.050> been<00:00:38.079> swapped<00:00:38.440> over<00:00:38.680> when

00:00:39.120 --> 00:00:39.130 
these leads have been swapped over when

00:00:39.130 --> 00:00:40.500 
these leads have been swapped over when
they've<00:00:39.280> been<00:00:39.489> connected<00:00:39.760> into<00:00:40.180> the<00:00:40.270> board

00:00:40.500 --> 00:00:40.510 
they've been connected into the board

00:00:40.510 --> 00:00:42.270 
they've been connected into the board
and<00:00:40.750> when<00:00:41.170> you're<00:00:41.320> trying<00:00:41.560> to<00:00:41.680> create<00:00:41.980> a<00:00:42.100> very

00:00:42.270 --> 00:00:42.280 
and when you're trying to create a very

00:00:42.280 --> 00:00:45.510 
and when you're trying to create a very
simple<00:00:42.520> easy<00:00:43.270> neat<00:00:43.840> wiring<00:00:44.410> loom<00:00:44.590> inside<00:00:45.220> a

00:00:45.510 --> 00:00:45.520 
simple easy neat wiring loom inside a

00:00:45.520 --> 00:00:49.680 
simple easy neat wiring loom inside a
model<00:00:45.940> it<00:00:46.360> is<00:00:46.660> easy<00:00:46.899> to<00:00:47.200> lose<00:00:47.320> track<00:00:47.820> so<00:00:48.820> let<00:00:49.600> me

00:00:49.680 --> 00:00:49.690 
model it is easy to lose track so let me

00:00:49.690 --> 00:00:51.330 
model it is easy to lose track so let me
just<00:00:49.899> show<00:00:50.020> you<00:00:50.050> what<00:00:50.260> I<00:00:50.290> do<00:00:50.410> so<00:00:50.950> here<00:00:51.190> we<00:00:51.309> are

00:00:51.330 --> 00:00:51.340 
just show you what I do so here we are

00:00:51.340 --> 00:00:54.479 
just show you what I do so here we are
in<00:00:51.730> the<00:00:51.969> ardupilot<00:00:52.420> comm<00:00:53.140> website<00:00:53.559> and<00:00:53.829> here

00:00:54.479 --> 00:00:54.489 
in the ardupilot comm website and here

00:00:54.489 --> 00:00:57.720 
in the ardupilot comm website and here
we<00:00:54.700> are<00:00:54.730> looking<00:00:54.940> at<00:00:55.480> the<00:00:55.719> output<00:00:55.960> pins<00:00:56.680> and<00:00:57.010> so

00:00:57.720 --> 00:00:57.730 
we are looking at the output pins and so

00:00:57.730 --> 00:00:59.639 
we are looking at the output pins and so
it<00:00:57.790> shows<00:00:58.000> you<00:00:58.149> where<00:00:58.390> the<00:00:58.420> motors<00:00:58.899> go<00:00:59.140> in<00:00:59.440> each

00:00:59.639 --> 00:00:59.649 
it shows you where the motors go in each

00:00:59.649 --> 00:01:02.880 
it shows you where the motors go in each
position<00:01:00.600> what<00:01:01.600> I<00:01:01.629> do<00:01:01.840> is<00:01:02.379> I<00:01:02.649> actually

00:01:02.880 --> 00:01:02.890 
position what I do is I actually

00:01:02.890 --> 00:01:06.120 
position what I do is I actually
physically<00:01:03.760> write<00:01:03.910> the<00:01:04.809> number<00:01:05.350> that's<00:01:05.860> on

00:01:06.120 --> 00:01:06.130 
physically write the number that's on

00:01:06.130 --> 00:01:09.120 
physically write the number that's on
each<00:01:06.640> of<00:01:06.820> the<00:01:06.880> motors<00:01:07.270> on<00:01:07.509> the<00:01:07.570> motor<00:01:08.380> arms<00:01:08.890> by

00:01:09.120 --> 00:01:09.130 
each of the motors on the motor arms by

00:01:09.130 --> 00:01:11.190 
each of the motors on the motor arms by
the<00:01:09.190> motor<00:01:09.490> and<00:01:09.760> also<00:01:10.390> on<00:01:10.630> the<00:01:10.840> servo

00:01:11.190 --> 00:01:11.200 
the motor and also on the servo

00:01:11.200 --> 00:01:13.080 
the motor and also on the servo
connectors<00:01:11.740> so<00:01:12.159> if<00:01:12.280> for<00:01:12.400> example<00:01:12.460> we're

00:01:13.080 --> 00:01:13.090 
connectors so if for example we're

00:01:13.090 --> 00:01:17.190 
connectors so if for example we're
looking<00:01:13.420> here<00:01:13.720> at<00:01:13.780> the<00:01:14.710> back<00:01:15.430> left<00:01:16.060> motor<00:01:16.479> then

00:01:17.190 --> 00:01:17.200 
looking here at the back left motor then

00:01:17.200 --> 00:01:20.280 
looking here at the back left motor then
that<00:01:17.440> is<00:01:17.740> supposed<00:01:18.100> to<00:01:18.190> have<00:01:18.490> number<00:01:19.299> three

00:01:20.280 --> 00:01:20.290 
that is supposed to have number three

00:01:20.290 --> 00:01:22.890 
that is supposed to have number three
written<00:01:20.740> on<00:01:20.799> it<00:01:20.950> so<00:01:21.790> here<00:01:22.000> we<00:01:22.119> are<00:01:22.150> there's

00:01:22.890 --> 00:01:22.900 
written on it so here we are there's

00:01:22.900 --> 00:01:25.730 
written on it so here we are there's
number<00:01:23.740> three<00:01:23.920> written<00:01:24.700> on<00:01:24.909> the<00:01:25.119> arm<00:01:25.360> and

00:01:25.730 --> 00:01:25.740 
number three written on the arm and

00:01:25.740 --> 00:01:29.039 
number three written on the arm and
there<00:01:26.740> is<00:01:26.979> also<00:01:27.430> number<00:01:28.030> three<00:01:28.299> written<00:01:28.869> on

00:01:29.039 --> 00:01:29.049 
there is also number three written on

00:01:29.049 --> 00:01:32.100 
there is also number three written on
the<00:01:29.560> servo<00:01:30.040> lead<00:01:30.659> now<00:01:31.659> the<00:01:31.750> reason<00:01:32.080> that

00:01:32.100 --> 00:01:32.110 
the servo lead now the reason that

00:01:32.110 --> 00:01:33.960 
the servo lead now the reason that
that's<00:01:32.320> useful<00:01:32.590> is<00:01:32.950> when<00:01:33.189> I<00:01:33.220> come<00:01:33.520> to<00:01:33.549> wire<00:01:33.790> up

00:01:33.960 --> 00:01:33.970 
that's useful is when I come to wire up

00:01:33.970 --> 00:01:35.490 
that's useful is when I come to wire up
the<00:01:34.090> APM<00:01:34.450> it's<00:01:34.630> really<00:01:34.840> straightforward

00:01:35.490 --> 00:01:35.500 
the APM it's really straightforward

00:01:35.500 --> 00:01:38.280 
the APM it's really straightforward
I<00:01:35.619> just<00:01:36.130> then<00:01:36.369> plug<00:01:36.670> the<00:01:37.210> servo<00:01:37.689> leads<00:01:37.990> and

00:01:38.280 --> 00:01:38.290 
I just then plug the servo leads and

00:01:38.290 --> 00:01:39.899 
I just then plug the servo leads and
check<00:01:38.560> the<00:01:38.680> number<00:01:39.009> that's<00:01:39.250> written<00:01:39.549> on<00:01:39.670> there

00:01:39.899 --> 00:01:39.909 
check the number that's written on there

00:01:39.909 --> 00:01:44.039 
check the number that's written on there
and<00:01:40.150> I<00:01:40.180> plug<00:01:40.420> that<00:01:40.600> straight<00:01:40.799> into<00:01:41.799> the<00:01:43.049> into

00:01:44.039 --> 00:01:44.049 
and I plug that straight into the into

00:01:44.049 --> 00:01:45.929 
and I plug that straight into the into
the<00:01:44.170> number<00:01:44.530> on<00:01:44.680> the<00:01:44.890> APM<00:01:45.310> that<00:01:45.640> it's<00:01:45.759> supposed

00:01:45.929 --> 00:01:45.939 
the number on the APM that it's supposed

00:01:45.939 --> 00:01:48.420 
the number on the APM that it's supposed
to<00:01:46.090> go<00:01:46.210> into<00:01:46.450> so<00:01:46.900> 1<00:01:47.110> goes<00:01:47.290> to<00:01:47.320> 1<00:01:47.500> 2<00:01:47.920> goes<00:01:48.130> to<00:01:48.159> 2

00:01:48.420 --> 00:01:48.430 
to go into so 1 goes to 1 2 goes to 2

00:01:48.430 --> 00:01:51.270 
to go into so 1 goes to 1 2 goes to 2
etc<00:01:48.790> etc<00:01:49.299> it<00:01:49.930> stops<00:01:50.200> all<00:01:50.439> the<00:01:50.560> confusion<00:01:51.130> and

00:01:51.270 --> 00:01:51.280 
etc etc it stops all the confusion and

00:01:51.280 --> 00:01:54.020 
etc etc it stops all the confusion and
makes<00:01:51.880> it<00:01:52.090> a<00:01:52.240> lot<00:01:52.450> easier<00:01:52.780> to<00:01:52.990> troubleshoot

00:01:54.020 --> 00:01:54.030
