 Galaxy S6 Headphone Calibration

00:00:02.630 --> 00:00:06.620

00:00:08.600 --> 00:00:12.250
Hi everyone, so today I'm going to show you how to make your headphones

00:00:12.250 --> 00:00:17.230
sound awesome on the Samsung Galaxy S6. Now one of the things I noticed with the

00:00:17.230 --> 00:00:18.720
headphones that came in the box was

00:00:18.720 --> 00:00:22.699
they sounded absolutely atrocious and I was thinking Samsung, why even bother.

00:00:22.699 --> 00:00:27.080
But actually what Samsung have done here is they've put some headphones in the box but then they've not

00:00:27.080 --> 00:00:28.419
calibrated the device

00:00:28.419 --> 00:00:32.320
in the slightest to use them properly, or
any headphones for that matter.

00:00:32.320 --> 00:00:35.800
Now this isn't particularly unusual when
you think about it,

00:00:35.800 --> 00:00:38.990
every set of headphones is going to require a slightly different profile. Galaxy S6 Headphone Calibration

00:00:38.990 --> 00:00:43.260
So how do we make this happen?  Well, it's quite simple. We go into settings,

00:00:43.260 --> 00:00:47.300
we go into our sound and notifications area,

00:00:49.300 --> 00:00:50.970
we go to

00:00:50.970 --> 00:00:55.320
sound quality and effects and we go to
adapt sound.

00:00:55.320 --> 00:00:58.370
Now what will happen is you put your
headphones

00:00:58.370 --> 00:01:02.700
in, you run the utility and it will
essentially ask you a few questions as

00:01:02.700 --> 00:01:03.630
you're running through it.

00:01:03.630 --> 00:01:07.220
So plug the headphones in

00:01:07.220 --> 00:01:14.220
and start.

00:01:14.950 --> 00:01:18.270
So each time you hear the beep, you say yes.

00:01:18.270 --> 00:01:23.020
Now obviously I can't do this whilst
talking to you at the same time so we're

00:01:23.020 --> 00:01:24.090
just going to fake this.

00:01:24.090 --> 00:01:27.340
But essentially what it's doing  Galaxy S6 Headphone Calibrationis it's
working out

00:01:27.340 --> 00:01:31.990
the frequencies that these headphones
can hear and then it's calibrating itself to

00:01:31.990 --> 00:01:32.660
ensure

00:01:32.660 --> 00:01:36.340
that it gives you the best, well, audio
quality possible

00:01:36.340 --> 00:01:40.190
from that particular set of headphones. 
Think of this as like a customised version

00:01:40.190 --> 00:01:41.080
of Beats.

00:01:41.080 --> 00:01:44.500
So then you can select which side you  frequently listen to.

00:01:44.500 --> 00:01:48.180
You can then preview what you've just heard or retry it.

00:01:48.180 --> 00:01:51.410
Now once you have that done, or as well
as having that done,

00:01:51.410 --> 00:01:55.210
you then have two additional options
here for when you're using your headphones.

00:01:55.210 --> 00:01:59.120
SoundAlive plus and Tube Amp. Now what
these really are

00:01:59.120 --> 00:02:03.450
are kind of a spatial sound effects for audio is the way I kind of look at it. Think of this

00:02:03.450 --> 00:02:07.130
as your 3DS Max sound and things like
that. Galaxy S6 Headphone Calibration

00:02:07.130 --> 00:02:11.120
What it does is it just adds a bit more
richness or in the case of the Tube Amp

00:02:11.120 --> 00:02:15.360
it adds a little bit more warmth. Now what
this does is improves the quality

00:02:15.360 --> 00:02:16.990
of audio when you're listening to it

00:02:16.990 --> 00:02:21.300
but just bear in mind that certain
types of music or certain types of sounds

00:02:21.300 --> 00:02:24.950
aren't going to sound particularly great through these particular tweaks.

00:02:24.950 --> 00:02:28.430
Again, the Adapt Sound that is absolutely spot-on for practically

00:02:28.430 --> 00:02:32.200
every set of headphones out there but
SoundAlive Plus and Tube Amp

00:02:32.200 --> 00:02:36.400
are well really a case by case. They
might work beautifully for some types of

00:02:36.400 --> 00:02:37.750
music but with other types of music

00:02:37.750 --> 00:02:41.160
it's going to make it sound a little bit
too well potentially blown out 

00:02:41.160 --> 00:02:45.600
in the mid-range. So there you have it. If
you've been struggling to get your

00:02:45.600 --> 00:02:47.760
Samsung Galaxy S6 or S6 Edge

00:02:47.760 --> 00:02:52.650
sounding really great with your headphones this is what you need to do.

00:02:52.650 --> 00:02:58.349
