of God is with them also a really
wonderful<00:03:59.480> way<00:03:59.600> to<00:03:59.630> pray<00:04:00.110> can<00:04:00.560> be<00:04:00.709> by<00:04:00.890> turning

00:04:01.330 --> 00:04:01.340 
wonderful way to pray can be by turning

00:04:01.340 --> 00:04:03.640 
wonderful way to pray can be by turning
an<00:04:01.430> ordinary<00:04:01.930> conversation<00:04:02.930> into<00:04:03.500> an

00:04:03.640 --> 00:04:03.650 
an ordinary conversation into an

00:04:03.650 --> 00:04:06.070 
an ordinary conversation into an
extraordinary<00:04:04.310> prayer<00:04:05.000> this<00:04:05.540> doesn't<00:04:05.930> mean

00:04:06.070 --> 00:04:06.080 
extraordinary prayer this doesn't mean

00:04:06.080 --> 00:04:08.740 
extraordinary prayer this doesn't mean
that<00:04:06.319> all<00:04:06.590> prayer<00:04:06.920> has<00:04:07.310> to<00:04:07.610> be<00:04:07.760> a<00:04:07.790> conversation

00:04:08.740 --> 00:04:08.750 
that all prayer has to be a conversation

00:04:08.750 --> 00:04:10.330 
that all prayer has to be a conversation
with<00:04:08.870> a<00:04:08.900> neighbor<00:04:09.230> but<00:04:09.590> it<00:04:09.709> does<00:04:09.980> mean<00:04:10.310> that

00:04:10.330 --> 00:04:10.340 
with a neighbor but it does mean that

00:04:10.340 --> 00:04:13.270 
with a neighbor but it does mean that
all<00:04:11.030> conversations<00:04:11.930> should<00:04:12.709> be<00:04:12.860> a<00:04:12.890> prayerful

00:04:13.270 --> 00:04:13.280 
all conversations should be a prayerful

all conversations should be a prayerful
encounter<00:04:13.970> with<00:04:14.150> God<00:04:14.360> perhaps<00:04:14.990> this<00:04:15.260> can

00:04:15.400 --> 00:04:15.410 
encounter with God perhaps this can

00:04:15.410 --> 00:04:17.920 
encounter with God perhaps this can
