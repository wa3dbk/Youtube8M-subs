00:00:00.788 --> 00:00:09.795
Hi everyone! As you can see we are at Techlabs. The first interview is going to be with Team Empire player. Introduce yourself please.

00:00:09.795 --> 00:00:14.841
Hello everyone! My nickname is Mag, my real name is Andrey Chepenko.

00:00:14.841 --> 00:00:23.660
Great! Tell us a bit about your preparations to Techlabs. You had a substitution in the team. How did your training go?

00:00:23.660 --> 00:00:31.594
We didn't have much time to prepare with Resolution, played skirmishes for 2 days. Seems like we are ready.

00:00:31.594 --> 00:00:34.482
Did you have any bootcamp or something prior to this?

00:00:34.482 --> 00:00:41.487
No, last bootcamp took place before Starladder, then it was mostly online.

00:00:41.487 --> 00:00:52.112
I wanted to ask why most teams underestimate some tournaments: Techlabs got great prize fund, but why preparation is not that good?

00:00:52.112 --> 00:01:03.433
Honestly, if we had a chance to prepare better, we would do it. But it didn't happen because the situation with that change took a lot of preparation time.

00:01:03.433 --> 00:01:11.358
So, you knew about it beforehand (about a week) and were looking for the new player.

00:01:11.358 --> 00:01:29.082
Actually, it was not like that. We discussed it, but thought that the change would come after Techlabs. But we haven't been training with Scandal, so management decided to make the substitution and play with Resolution at Techlabs.

00:01:29.082 --> 00:01:38.217
Can you estimate the result of those two days? Did you get what you expected?

00:01:38.217 --> 00:01:49.754
At the moment everyone is satisfied with the current situation. There are no difficulties: team atmosphere is great, let's see how it goes.

00:01:49.754 --> 00:02:03.041
Let's talk a bit more about the substitution. You described the situation on your site, every player talked about it.

00:02:03.041 --> 00:02:11.630
What made you do it? Was it pressured by fans or was it your own initiative? There was nothing like that before in CIS: the change comes and that's it.

00:02:11.630 --> 00:02:30.044
It was because of the fans in general, there were loads of angry people who tried to disgrace us. Actually it would be better to do a video blog with one player who could describe it in details.

00:02:30.044 --> 00:02:46.189
But we decided to do it in the way it's done, so every player could put a similar comment that Roman answered aggressively to the critics and we couldn't train mainly because of his attitude.

00:02:46.189 --> 00:03:00.648
Everything started after Starladder. We won ESWC, but there was no NaVi or Alliance there and we aim to play on the same level as these teams. That's why we came to conclusion about replacement.

00:03:00.648 --> 00:03:20.877
While you talk about ESWC, let's talk about your plans. How do you personally evaluate that win? Did you have any feeling that you won a big tournament and you are on the road to success now?

00:03:20.877 --> 00:03:40.471
I can't say so. We could feel that way if we won Starladder with NaVi and Alliance being present. But anyway, the organization of the tournament was great, weather was good. We won some money and had some walks through the city.

00:03:40.471 --> 00:03:54.237
If you remember, there was a similar situation last year: NaVi and Dignitas played in the finals while other teams were weak. Nonetheless, we can be proud of this win, but it was not significant.

00:03:54.237 --> 00:04:03.933
You said that you had won some cash and managed to see the city. What is important for you in Dota: achievements, fame, money or something else?

00:04:03.933 --> 00:04:12.035
Self-realization, the love of fans, emotions. Of course money is a good factor too.

00:04:12.035 --> 00:04:23.852
Let's talk about Teachlabs. Tell us about the organization, how did they meet you? Did you have a chance to take some rest before the games?

00:04:23.852 --> 00:04:37.805
It is hard to say something, we just played our first games with Power Rangers. I like everything so far: the place is nice, let's see how it goes.

00:04:37.805 --> 00:04:41.520
Are you going to see the city or you are rushing back home after the games?

00:04:41.520 --> 00:04:53.633
I have been to Moscow with my parents before when I was not a gamer and I have been to many places of interest.

00:04:53.633 --> 00:04:57.782
What about a game with Power Rangers? Was it a walkthrough?

00:04:57.782 --> 00:05:12.246
No, they actually have confronted us. But I must say that the time for games was quite early. I can tell that opponents were prepared for us and they still can show something.

00:05:12.246 --> 00:05:14.786
Are you afraid of Virtus.Pro?

00:05:14.786 --> 00:05:22.897
A little bit. We can see that they started playing better than it was month ago. But I don't think they can overcome us.

00:05:22.897 --> 00:05:36.268
You always do player shuffles with RoX.KIS. Is it some kind of animosity between organizations?

00:05:36.268 --> 00:05:53.039
Well, there were only 2 player shuffles: Vanskor and Resolution. As far as I know Vanskor left because he had conflict with other players, Resolution always wanted to play with us, so when we offered him a spot, he happily accepted it.

00:05:53.039 --> 00:05:58.702
So you called him to join you. Wasn't it like "Guys, I urgently want to leave. Take me please"?

00:05:58.702 --> 00:06:09.104
No, of course. We talked about it long time ago, I think it was before ESWC.

00:06:09.104 --> 00:06:12.888
Where can we see Empire in the closest future?

00:06:12.888 --> 00:06:28.557
EMS in Poland of course. We will be training hard for it, because we are going to face tough opponents. If we make it to top-3, then it will be quite an achievement.

00:06:28.557 --> 00:06:31.440
Is it an achievement for you to be top-3 at Techlabs?

00:06:31.440 --> 00:06:35.387
Maybe for VP, but not for us.

00:06:35.387 --> 00:06:43.603
Actually this interview is for Gosugamers. Can you tell us something about it? Do you visit the site and what do you think of it in general?

00:06:43.603 --> 00:07:02.984
It is my favorite site for last 2-3 years. I check it daily, everything looks nice. I like the recent additions, especially draft phase of the past games.

00:07:02.984 --> 00:07:11.257
Oh, I have another question about Solo: they remembered what he was banned for. What is your opinion about the situation?

00:07:11.257 --> 00:07:25.512
I feel for him. He deserves the punishment, but not so cruel as it is now: VP signed him, but kicked shortly after because he was banned on some leagues.

00:07:25.512 --> 00:07:34.681
Have this situation had some influence on you? Will you make bets on Dota matches or not after it?

00:07:34.681 --> 00:07:41.784
I don't see any reason to take this kind of risk where I can lose my career and reputation to get a couple of hundred dollars.

00:07:41.784 --> 00:07:44.999
Any final shoutouts?

00:07:44.999 --> 00:07:55.457
Sure, shoutout to all our fans and sponsors: Seagate, Twitch, Razer.

00:07:55.457 --> 00:07:59.457
Thank you for the interview! Hello to GosuGamers, see you!

00:07:59.457 --> 00:08:00.000
