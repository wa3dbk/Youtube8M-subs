00:01:02.670 --> 00:01:07.079
 with him so he does not multiply and 

00:01:04.710 --> 00:01:08.969
 happen that coming war he too 

00:01:07.079 --> 00:01:11.940

 against us and leave the earth 

00:01:11.940 --> 00:01:16.260
 Then they put commissaries on them 

00:01:14.400 --> 00:01:18.570
 of taxes that bothered them with their 

00:01:16.260 --> 00:01:21.740

 python and ramses storage cities 

00:01:21.740 --> 00:01:27.150
 but the more they oppressed them the more 

00:01:24.780 --> 00:01:28.950
 multiplied and grew in a way that 

00:01:27.150 --> 00:01:30.170
 the Egyptians feared the children of 

00:01:28.950 --> 00:01:32.299
 Israel 

00:01:30.170 --> 00:01:34.729
 and the Egyptians did serve the 

00:01:32.299 --> 00:01:36.740
 children of Israel harshly and bitterly 

00:01:34.729 --> 00:01:39.110
 his life with hard servitude in doing 

00:01:36.740 --> 00:01:41.689
 mud and brick and in all work of the 

00:01:39.110 --> 00:01:44.780
 field and in all its service to which the 

00:01:41.689 --> 00:01:46.909
 rigorously forced and spoke the king of 

00:01:44.780 --> 00:01:49.009
 Egypt to the Hebrew midwives a 

00:01:46.909 --> 00:01:51.710
 of which it was called number and another 

00:01:49.009 --> 00:01:54.590
 escape and told them when you are like that 

00:01:51.710 --> 00:01:57.619
 Hebrews in their births and see sex if 

00:01:54.590 --> 00:02:01.070
 it's son to kill him and if he's a daughter then 

00:01:57.619 --> 00:02:02.659
 alive but the midwives feared god and 

00:02:01.070 --> 00:02:04.940
 they did not do as the king of 

00:02:02.659 --> 00:02:07.670
 Egypt but they preserved life to 

00:02:04.940 --> 00:02:09.799
 the children and the king of egypt called 

00:02:07.670 --> 00:02:11.810
 to the midwives and told them why you have 

00:02:09.799 --> 00:02:14.630
 done this that you have preserved life 

00:02:11.810 --> 00:02:17.150
 the children and the midwives responded 

00:02:14.630 --> 00:02:19.580
 to Pharaoh because the Hebrew women do not 

00:02:17.150 --> 00:02:21.890
 they are like the Egyptians because they are robust 

00:02:19.580 --> 00:02:22.910
 and they give birth before the midwife comes to 

00:02:21.890 --> 00:02:25.550
 they 

00:02:22.910 --> 00:02:27.800
 and god did the midwives and the 

00:02:25.550 --> 00:02:30.440
 village multiplied and strengthened in 

00:02:27.800 --> 00:02:33.910
 great way and for having midwives 

00:02:30.440 --> 00:02:36.380
 had goodbye the prosperous their families 

00:02:33.910 --> 00:02:39.050
 Then Pharaoh sent all his people 

00:02:36.380 --> 00:02:43.480
 saying to the river every son that 

00:02:39.050 --> 00:02:43.480
