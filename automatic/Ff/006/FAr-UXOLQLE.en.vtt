00:00:04.640 --> 00:00:04.650 
we've told our guys all season long that

00:00:04.650 --> 00:00:07.670 
we've told our guys all season long that
there<00:00:04.799> are<00:00:04.950> no<00:00:05.190> little<00:00:05.640> things<00:00:06.080> but<00:00:07.080> matches

00:00:07.670 --> 00:00:07.680 
there are no little things but matches

00:00:07.680 --> 00:00:09.230 
there are no little things but matches
can<00:00:07.859> turn<00:00:08.069> on<00:00:08.250> one<00:00:08.429> or<00:00:08.550> two<00:00:08.580> points<00:00:09.059> and<00:00:09.179> I

00:00:09.230 --> 00:00:09.240 
can turn on one or two points and I

00:00:09.240 --> 00:00:10.370 
can turn on one or two points and I
thought<00:00:09.420> that's<00:00:09.540> exactly<00:00:09.929> what<00:00:10.110> happened

00:00:10.370 --> 00:00:10.380 
thought that's exactly what happened

00:00:10.380 --> 00:00:12.770 
thought that's exactly what happened
tonight<00:00:10.469> we<00:00:10.849> were<00:00:11.849> down<00:00:12.059> early<00:00:12.389> in<00:00:12.480> the<00:00:12.570> first

00:00:12.770 --> 00:00:12.780 
tonight we were down early in the first

00:00:12.780 --> 00:00:15.169 
tonight we were down early in the first
and<00:00:13.139> had<00:00:14.070> a<00:00:14.099> few<00:00:14.280> things<00:00:14.429> kind<00:00:14.730> of<00:00:14.759> go<00:00:14.880> our<00:00:15.000> way

00:00:15.169 --> 00:00:15.179 
and had a few things kind of go our way

00:00:15.179 --> 00:00:18.470 
and had a few things kind of go our way
in<00:00:15.330> the<00:00:15.420> end<00:00:15.450> and<00:00:16.039> snuck<00:00:17.039> away<00:00:17.160> with<00:00:17.550> with<00:00:18.449> the

00:00:18.470 --> 00:00:18.480 
in the end and snuck away with with the

00:00:18.480 --> 00:00:19.970 
in the end and snuck away with with the
first<00:00:18.750> set<00:00:18.930> win<00:00:19.109> and<00:00:19.350> then<00:00:19.439> the<00:00:19.500> same<00:00:19.680> thing<00:00:19.890> in

00:00:19.970 --> 00:00:19.980 
first set win and then the same thing in

00:00:19.980 --> 00:00:22.460 
first set win and then the same thing in
the<00:00:20.039> third<00:00:20.220> down<00:00:20.490> a<00:00:20.520> few<00:00:20.820> and<00:00:21.199> made<00:00:22.199> a<00:00:22.230> few

00:00:22.460 --> 00:00:22.470 
the third down a few and made a few

00:00:22.470 --> 00:00:24.590 
the third down a few and made a few
little<00:00:23.100> place<00:00:23.430> serve<00:00:23.789> some<00:00:24.000> balls<00:00:24.180> real<00:00:24.300> well

00:00:24.590 --> 00:00:24.600 
little place serve some balls real well

00:00:24.600 --> 00:00:26.870 
little place serve some balls real well
and<00:00:24.840> I<00:00:25.769> thought<00:00:26.010> that<00:00:26.099> was<00:00:26.189> a<00:00:26.250> hallmark<00:00:26.490> of<00:00:26.789> our

00:00:26.870 --> 00:00:26.880 
and I thought that was a hallmark of our

00:00:26.880 --> 00:00:28.759 
and I thought that was a hallmark of our
team<00:00:27.119> the<00:00:27.269> last<00:00:27.420> two<00:00:28.019> matches<00:00:28.380> actually<00:00:28.740> I

00:00:28.759 --> 00:00:28.769 
team the last two matches actually I

00:00:28.769 --> 00:00:30.169 
team the last two matches actually I
thought<00:00:28.949> we<00:00:29.099> were<00:00:29.429> really<00:00:29.609> good<00:00:29.910> from<00:00:30.090> the

00:00:30.169 --> 00:00:30.179 
thought we were really good from the

00:00:30.179 --> 00:00:32.659 
thought we were really good from the
service<00:00:30.510> line<00:00:30.830> put<00:00:31.830> a<00:00:31.859> lot<00:00:32.009> of<00:00:32.040> pressure<00:00:32.369> on

00:00:32.659 --> 00:00:32.669 
service line put a lot of pressure on

00:00:32.669 --> 00:00:36.049 
service line put a lot of pressure on
our<00:00:33.030> opponents<00:00:33.510> but<00:00:34.489> more<00:00:35.489> than<00:00:35.579> anything<00:00:35.700> the

00:00:36.049 --> 00:00:36.059 
our opponents but more than anything the

00:00:36.059 --> 00:00:38.119 
our opponents but more than anything the
boys<00:00:36.239> just<00:00:36.540> did<00:00:36.989> what<00:00:37.770> they've<00:00:37.920> been<00:00:38.070> doing

00:00:38.119 --> 00:00:38.129 
boys just did what they've been doing

00:00:38.129 --> 00:00:40.220 
boys just did what they've been doing
all<00:00:38.489> season<00:00:38.670> long<00:00:38.969> which<00:00:39.300> is<00:00:39.329> continue<00:00:40.140> to

extra play if we can get a little bit
better<00:02:23.030> and<00:02:23.209> so<00:02:23.329> that's<00:02:23.480> what<00:02:23.630> we've<00:02:23.780> talked

00:02:23.979 --> 00:02:23.989 
better and so that's what we've talked

00:02:23.989 --> 00:02:24.630 
better and so that's what we've talked
about

00:02:24.630 --> 00:02:24.640 
about

00:02:24.640 --> 00:02:26.700 
about
every<00:02:24.850> day<00:02:25.000> in<00:02:25.180> practice<00:02:25.210> us<00:02:25.720> get<00:02:26.260> a<00:02:26.290> tiny<00:02:26.530> bit

00:02:26.700 --> 00:02:26.710 
every day in practice us get a tiny bit

00:02:26.710 --> 00:02:28.530 
every day in practice us get a tiny bit
better<00:02:26.740> so<00:02:27.370> that's<00:02:27.580> I<00:02:27.850> think<00:02:27.880> the<00:02:28.090> mode<00:02:28.300> when

00:02:28.530 --> 00:02:28.540 
better so that's I think the mode when

00:02:28.540 --> 00:02:37.600 
better so that's I think the mode when
you<00:02:28.600> go<00:02:28.720> back<00:02:28.900> to

00:02:37.600 --> 00:02:37.610 

00:02:37.610 --> 00:02:39.670 

you
