00:00:05.420 --> 00:00:12.900
 my chiropractor recommend 

00:00:08.220 --> 00:00:14.250
 head rotation do with girth 

00:00:12.900 --> 00:00:16.789
 neck hands 

00:00:14.250 --> 00:00:20.910
 it is for age clients that 

00:00:16.789 --> 00:00:23.970
 will keep the vehicle vertebrae from shifting 

00:00:20.910 --> 00:00:27.180
 but pay attention don't press down on 

00:00:23.970 --> 00:00:31.160
 neck also in the workout buddy is she special 

00:00:27.180 --> 00:00:34.759
 attention warming up the thoracic 

00:00:31.160 --> 00:00:34.759
 upper case 

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:43.530
 now we will work out the movement 

00:00:42.610 --> 00:00:46.330
 breastfeeding 

00:00:43.530 --> 00:00:49.420
 develop the thoracic and in 

00:00:46.330 --> 00:00:53.740
 among other things work out the beginning of a wave 

00:00:49.420 --> 00:00:56.590
 up that is we will be in this part we 

00:00:53.740 --> 00:00:59.670
 working on mobility of the hip 

00:00:56.590 --> 00:01:04.330
 joints slightly tolerated 

00:00:59.670 --> 00:01:06.300
 heaviness of the body in the joint but not force 

00:01:04.330 --> 00:01:09.130
 movement that is, make sure that 

00:01:06.300 --> 00:01:10.869
 pupils are not too aggressive and in 

00:01:09.130 --> 00:01:14.530
 this movement necessarily follows 

00:01:10.869 --> 00:01:17.320
 negotiate for them that as a result 

00:01:14.530 --> 00:01:21.100
 then we won't dance so much 

00:01:17.320 --> 00:01:24.250
 fall into the hip joint 

00:01:21.100 --> 00:01:28.150
 in this part we are working on the passage of the Komi 

00:01:24.250 --> 00:01:30.930
 springy step and also above the passage 

00:01:28.150 --> 00:01:33.930
 which Komi are used elastic 

00:01:30.930 --> 00:01:33.930
 items 

00:01:35.399 --> 00:01:42.189
 so let's start working out the waves through the circle 

00:01:39.579 --> 00:01:44.740
 hips vertical circle necessarily 

00:01:42.189 --> 00:01:46.899
 Watching the tailbone spin up 

00:01:44.740 --> 00:01:50.259
 and twisted tail bone necessarily 

00:01:46.899 --> 00:01:52.640
 we carry above that is completed circle 

00:01:50.259 --> 00:01:55.850
 hips 

00:01:52.640 --> 00:01:58.490
 first we work out lifting the thigh 

00:01:55.850 --> 00:02:02.270
 muscles must remind your 

00:01:58.490 --> 00:02:05.300
 clients that penetrations we raise the hips 

00:02:02.270 --> 00:02:07.820
 first the muscles of the gluteus muscles of the legs 

00:02:05.300 --> 00:02:10.580
 in any case not by muscles 

00:02:07.820 --> 00:02:14.680
 and also what we do rocking down 

00:02:10.580 --> 00:02:14.680
 through the quickdraw 

00:02:14.840 --> 00:02:22.110
 In this exercise, we are practicing strikes 

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:26.490
 one bucket blows over do through 

00:02:22.110 --> 00:02:29.400
 small live knees blows down we 

00:02:26.490 --> 00:02:31.660
 sure to fix a blow to the form 

00:02:29.400 --> 00:02:34.860
 buttocks and pinch 

00:02:31.660 --> 00:02:34.860
 these three blows down 

00:02:36.470 --> 00:02:41.640
 Required before class 

00:02:39.150 --> 00:02:44.940
 prepare your student's knees 

00:02:41.640 --> 00:02:47.430
 heat them up if any of your 

00:02:44.940 --> 00:02:50.550
 senor there are problems with the knee 

00:02:47.430 --> 00:02:51.150
 joints then they don't make the pendulum in 

00:02:50.550 --> 00:02:55.710
 glue 

00:02:51.150 --> 00:02:58.040
 do not sit dressed only on a straight leg 

00:02:55.710 --> 00:03:01.040
 knee works naturally but without 

00:02:58.040 --> 00:03:01.040
 squat down 

00:03:01.819 --> 00:03:07.349
 so in this exercise we work 

00:03:04.470 --> 00:03:08.600
 shrug hands and impose these 

00:03:07.349 --> 00:03:12.490
 movements on 

00:03:08.600 --> 00:03:12.490
 belly dance routine 

00:03:12.730 --> 00:03:18.310
 and so in this bundle we work 

00:03:16.599 --> 00:03:21.400
 plastic elements 

00:03:18.310 --> 00:03:24.720
 be sure to monitor the range 

00:03:21.400 --> 00:03:31.290
 execution of movements in your students and 

00:03:24.720 --> 00:03:31.290
 also for fixing the upper case 

00:03:40.660 --> 00:03:43.200
 fret 

00:04:01.900 --> 00:04:07.739
 learning in circles too 4 

00:04:09.450 --> 00:04:15.720
 even a bunch of us squares hit left 

00:04:14.560 --> 00:04:18.370
 hip 

00:04:15.720 --> 00:04:21.810
 step is equal to Peter 

00:04:18.370 --> 00:04:21.810
 go out to frame 

00:04:26.600 --> 00:04:29.720
 at 

00:04:28.190 --> 00:04:31.750
 but 

00:04:29.720 --> 00:04:31.750
 and
