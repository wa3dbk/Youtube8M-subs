00:00:02.629 --> 00:00:07.680
 for the ban recipe 

00:00:05.009 --> 00:00:09.750
 we can put a little onions in 

00:00:07.680 --> 00:00:10.650
 powder which gives us taste but 

00:00:09.750 --> 00:00:13.830
 it's optional 

00:00:10.650 --> 00:00:17.039
 it will take two to four hundred he 

00:00:13.830 --> 00:00:21.869
 dominates according to your desires 30 

00:00:17.039 --> 00:00:23.880
 centilitres 2,500 g of flour and 20 g of 

00:00:21.869 --> 00:00:27.480
 true yeast the first thing to do 

00:00:23.880 --> 00:00:29.539
 it is to untie our yeast with 

00:00:27.480 --> 00:00:33.570
 the other 

00:00:29.539 --> 00:00:36.300
 small reminder it is necessary that the water is at 

00:00:33.570 --> 00:00:38.940
 ambient temperature and especially not too much 

00:00:36.300 --> 00:00:42.300
 day which was likely to burn and the 

00:00:38.940 --> 00:00:45.989
 yeast is actually killing this yeast 

00:00:42.300 --> 00:00:47.300
 who will never show it well 

00:00:45.989 --> 00:00:54.840
 next to 

00:00:47.300 --> 00:01:01.760
 take the flour and add the onions 

00:00:54.840 --> 00:01:01.760
 in powder then olive oil 

00:01:04.699 --> 00:01:13.460
 and then add water and yeast 

00:01:09.759 --> 00:01:15.710
 do not suddenly add that to yourself 

00:01:13.460 --> 00:01:23.539
 will work pasta as 

00:01:15.710 --> 00:01:25.840
 and then added one more 

00:01:23.539 --> 00:01:25.840
 little water 

00:01:29.120 --> 00:01:34.080
 the influential man with the eyes that you 

00:01:31.350 --> 00:01:39.630
 will not put two 

00:01:34.080 --> 00:01:46.220
 troops that you continue good of everything 

00:01:39.630 --> 00:01:46.220
 mix and complete with the rest 2 

00:01:46.970 --> 00:01:52.220
 and take good yeast that will stay 

00:01:52.310 --> 00:01:58.380
 then you have to work the dough well 

00:01:55.400 --> 00:02:06.170
 and if it sticks a little you add 

00:01:58.380 --> 00:02:10.610
 flour 1 gets a firm dough 

00:02:06.170 --> 00:02:14.370
 and the secret the name is going to be the 

00:02:10.610 --> 00:02:18.720
 knead three times and each time the go 

00:02:14.370 --> 00:02:19.940
 so that's why we see went a 

00:02:18.720 --> 00:02:33.150
 little flour 

00:02:19.940 --> 00:02:41.280
 according to total you take out the dough and you 

00:02:33.150 --> 00:02:43.110
 have the tour is well kneaded that 

00:02:41.280 --> 00:02:46.260
 you take in the palm of your hand 

00:02:43.110 --> 00:02:52.400
 you move forward and you come and you do 

00:02:46.260 --> 00:02:52.400
 that for about five minutes 

00:02:53.090 --> 00:03:00.450
 and then you need the same 

00:02:56.280 --> 00:03:02.850
 pasta work you put it back into 

00:03:00.450 --> 00:03:05.750
 know it and let it rest 

00:03:02.850 --> 00:03:12.470
 for 10 minutes 

00:03:05.750 --> 00:03:12.470
 ten minutes later take back your dough 

00:03:15.650 --> 00:03:23.450

00:03:23.450 --> 00:03:28.190

00:03:28.430 --> 00:03:37.490
 that is, take the dough and help

 wrist and skin you advance 

00:03:37.490 --> 00:03:47.100
 like this is still for five 

00:03:42.510 --> 00:03:47.840
 minutes and we'll put it back in the 

00:03:47.100 --> 00:03:52.200
 bowl 

00:03:47.840 --> 00:04:00.650
