and got them to work it again and these

00:00:25.199 --> 00:00:26.720 
and got them to work it again and these
are<00:00:25.350> just<00:00:25.500> the<00:00:25.590> kind<00:00:25.830> that<00:00:26.010> you<00:00:26.189> stick<00:00:26.430> in<00:00:26.460> your

00:00:26.720 --> 00:00:26.730 
are just the kind that you stick in your

00:00:26.730 --> 00:00:28.730 
are just the kind that you stick in your
garden<00:00:27.150> you<00:00:27.180> know<00:00:27.630> or<00:00:27.900> on<00:00:28.050> your<00:00:28.199> walkway<00:00:28.410> or

00:00:28.730 --> 00:00:28.740 
garden you know or on your walkway or

00:00:28.740 --> 00:00:30.830 
garden you know or on your walkway or
whatever<00:00:29.039> just<00:00:29.279> you<00:00:29.369> have<00:00:29.460> a<00:00:29.490> little<00:00:29.699> life<00:00:29.849> but

00:00:30.830 --> 00:00:30.840 
whatever just you have a little life but

00:00:30.840 --> 00:00:33.530 
whatever just you have a little life but
I<00:00:30.869> was<00:00:30.960> gonna<00:00:31.109> mention<00:00:31.380> just<00:00:32.250> real<00:00:32.460> quick<00:00:32.730> that

00:00:33.530 --> 00:00:33.540 
I was gonna mention just real quick that

00:00:33.540 --> 00:00:36.220 
I was gonna mention just real quick that
these<00:00:33.960> are<00:00:34.170> probably<00:00:34.620> pretty<00:00:34.829> good<00:00:35.070> to<00:00:35.309> have

00:00:36.220 --> 00:00:36.230 
these are probably pretty good to have

00:00:36.230 --> 00:00:38.810 
these are probably pretty good to have
because<00:00:37.230> in<00:00:37.440> a<00:00:37.530> pinch<00:00:37.890> in<00:00:38.219> Abeka

00:00:38.810 --> 00:00:38.820 
because in a pinch in Abeka

00:00:38.820 --> 00:00:40.880 
because in a pinch in Abeka
they<00:00:39.719> will<00:00:39.930> put<00:00:40.140> out<00:00:40.260> a<00:00:40.290> little<00:00:40.440> bit<00:00:40.590> of<00:00:40.680> light

00:00:40.880 --> 00:00:40.890 
they will put out a little bit of light

00:00:40.890 --> 00:00:43.369 
they will put out a little bit of light
so<00:00:41.790> if<00:00:42.090> you<00:00:42.210> ever<00:00:42.329> find<00:00:42.629> yourself<00:00:42.780> in<00:00:43.079> a<00:00:43.170> power

00:00:43.369 --> 00:00:43.379 
so if you ever find yourself in a power

00:00:43.379 --> 00:00:45.650 
so if you ever find yourself in a power
outage<00:00:43.710> you'll<00:00:44.489> have<00:00:44.730> these<00:00:45.000> that<00:00:45.390> will<00:00:45.480> work

00:00:45.650 --> 00:00:45.660 
outage you'll have these that will work

00:00:45.660 --> 00:00:48.440 
outage you'll have these that will work
