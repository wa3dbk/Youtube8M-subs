00:00:13.730 --> 00:00:13.740 
on the 460 video how do you sli how do

00:00:13.740 --> 00:00:15.470 
on the 460 video how do you sli how do
you<00:00:13.889> make<00:00:14.009> it<00:00:14.160> work<00:00:14.210> the<00:00:15.210> different

00:00:15.470 --> 00:00:15.480 
you make it work the different

00:00:15.480 --> 00:00:18.019 
you make it work the different
combinations<00:00:16.109> on<00:00:16.379> why<00:00:16.859> it<00:00:16.920> works<00:00:17.250> and<00:00:17.580> some

00:00:18.019 --> 00:00:18.029 
combinations on why it works and some

bench tests what I'm going to do today

00:00:19.350 --> 00:00:22.880 
bench tests what I'm going to do today
is<00:00:20.039> show<00:00:20.279> you<00:00:20.340> how<00:00:20.520> to<00:00:20.580> put<00:00:20.910> it<00:00:21.029> in<00:00:21.180> and<00:00:21.890> connect

00:00:22.880 --> 00:00:22.890 
is show you how to put it in and connect

00:00:22.890 --> 00:00:24.620 
is show you how to put it in and connect
it<00:00:23.039> all<00:00:23.130> basically<00:00:23.580> and<00:00:23.970> then<00:00:24.390> I'm<00:00:24.480> going<00:00:24.570> to

00:00:24.620 --> 00:00:24.630 
it all basically and then I'm going to

00:00:24.630 --> 00:00:26.000 
it all basically and then I'm going to

you how to put it in SLI using the
Nvidia<00:00:33.540> control<00:00:33.660> panel<00:00:33.930> so<00:00:34.770> you<00:00:34.829> look<00:00:34.980> over

00:00:35.240 --> 00:00:35.250 
Nvidia control panel so you look over

00:00:35.250 --> 00:00:38.060 
Nvidia control panel so you look over
here<00:00:35.899> don't<00:00:36.899> pay<00:00:36.989> attention<00:00:37.380> to<00:00:37.469> this<00:00:37.590> all<00:00:37.829> my

00:00:38.060 --> 00:00:38.070 
here don't pay attention to this all my

here don't pay attention to this all my
physical<00:00:38.520> motion<00:00:39.270> but<00:00:39.570> these<00:00:39.750> are<00:00:39.899> the<00:00:39.960> two

00:00:40.130 --> 00:00:40.140

brand<00:00:47.489> cards<00:00:47.910> as<00:00:48.000> long<00:00:48.090> as<00:00:48.329> they<00:00:48.420> have<00:00:48.600> the

00:00:48.740 --> 00:00:48.750 
brand cards as long as they have the

00:00:48.750 --> 00:00:54.319 
brand cards as long as they have the
same<00:00:48.930> chip<00:00:50.270> Amram<00:00:51.270> of<00:00:51.539> course<00:00:52.309> but<00:00:53.329> they're

00:00:54.319 --> 00:00:54.329 
same chip Amram of course but they're

00:00:54.329 --> 00:00:57.020 
same chip Amram of course but they're
both<00:00:54.510> vanilla<00:00:54.930> 460<00:00:55.649> so<00:00:55.949> and<00:00:56.730> I've<00:00:56.940> already

00:00:57.020 --> 00:00:57.030 
both vanilla 460 so and I've already

00:00:57.030 --> 00:00:59.290 
both vanilla 460 so and I've already
tested<00:00:57.270> it<00:00:57.539> and<00:00:57.629> it<00:00:57.719> does<00:00:57.870> work<00:00:58.050> all<00:00:58.859> you<00:00:59.100> do

00:00:59.290 --> 00:00:59.300 
tested it and it does work all you do

00:00:59.300 --> 00:01:08.450 
tested it and it does work all you do
you<00:01:00.300> plug<00:01:00.719> in<00:01:00.870> the<00:01:00.960> first<00:01:01.170> one<00:01:06.590> yes<00:01:07.619> good<00:01:08.310> go

00:01:08.450 --> 00:01:08.460 
you plug in the first one yes good go

00:01:08.460 --> 00:01:13.760 
you plug in the first one yes good go
then<00:01:09.330> you<00:01:09.900> got<00:01:10.110> the<00:01:10.290> second<00:01:10.770> one<00:01:11.840> and<00:01:12.840> since<00:01:13.619> I

00:01:13.760 --> 00:01:13.770 
then you got the second one and since I

00:01:13.770 --> 00:01:15.260 
then you got the second one and since I
will<00:01:13.950> put<00:01:14.130> the<00:01:14.220> physics<00:01:14.580> in<00:01:14.700> the<00:01:14.790> middle<00:01:15.060> I'm

00:01:15.260 --> 00:01:15.270 
will put the physics in the middle I'm

00:01:15.270 --> 00:01:17.920 
will put the physics in the middle I'm
going<00:01:15.420> to<00:01:15.479> put<00:01:15.630> this<00:01:15.750> on<00:01:15.900> the<00:01:15.990> very<00:01:16.140> bottom

00:01:17.920 --> 00:01:17.930 
going to put this on the very bottom

00:01:17.930 --> 00:01:20.990 
going to put this on the very bottom
alright<00:01:18.930> get<00:01:19.259> in<00:01:19.439> there<00:01:19.710> one<00:01:20.100> side<00:01:20.430> there<00:01:20.970> so

00:01:20.990 --> 00:01:21.000 
alright get in there one side there so

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:25.670 
alright get in there one side there so
I'm<00:01:21.210> good<00:01:21.509> to<00:01:21.600> go<00:01:21.659> then<00:01:23.390> you<00:01:24.390> take<00:01:24.600> your<00:01:24.680> single

00:01:25.670 --> 00:01:25.680 
I'm good to go then you take your single

00:01:25.680 --> 00:01:27.710 
I'm good to go then you take your single
sli<00:01:26.310> bridge<00:01:26.430> this<00:01:27.150> comes<00:01:27.390> with<00:01:27.540> your

00:01:27.710 --> 00:01:27.720 
sli bridge this comes with your

00:01:27.720 --> 00:01:29.420 
sli bridge this comes with your
motherboard<00:01:28.080> it<00:01:28.560> does<00:01:28.710> not<00:01:28.950> come<00:01:29.220> with<00:01:29.340> the

00:01:29.420 --> 00:01:29.430 
motherboard it does not come with the

00:01:29.430 --> 00:01:31.370 
motherboard it does not come with the
graphics<00:01:29.820> card<00:01:30.090> so<00:01:30.479> if<00:01:30.600> you<00:01:30.689> did<00:01:30.869> not<00:01:30.990> get<00:01:31.229> one

00:01:31.370 --> 00:01:31.380 
graphics card so if you did not get one

00:01:31.380 --> 00:01:32.929 
graphics card so if you did not get one
of<00:01:31.409> these<00:01:31.530> in<00:01:31.740> your<00:01:31.829> motherboard<00:01:32.130> or<00:01:32.610> you<00:01:32.700> lost

00:01:32.929 --> 00:01:32.939 
of these in your motherboard or you lost

00:01:32.939 --> 00:01:34.190 
of these in your motherboard or you lost
it<00:01:33.210> for<00:01:33.329> whatever<00:01:33.450> reason<00:01:33.840> they're<00:01:33.960> pretty

00:01:34.190 --> 00:01:34.200 
it for whatever reason they're pretty

00:01:34.200 --> 00:01:36.620 
it for whatever reason they're pretty
inexpensive<00:01:34.579> you<00:01:35.579> can<00:01:35.700> get<00:01:35.850> them<00:01:35.970> on<00:01:36.090> new<00:01:36.600> a

00:01:36.620 --> 00:01:36.630 
inexpensive you can get them on new a

00:01:36.630 --> 00:01:40.160

00:01:43.619 --> 00:01:49.760 
alive it's pretty simple and you just
push<00:01:43.890> it<00:01:43.920> on<00:01:44.159> and<00:01:46.610> push<00:01:47.610> it<00:01:47.729> on<00:01:47.850> and<00:01:48.439> urs<00:01:49.439> allied

00:01:49.760 --> 00:01:49.770 
push it on and push it on and urs allied

00:01:49.770 --> 00:01:51.560 
push it on and push it on and urs allied
don't<00:01:50.549> forget<00:01:50.759> to<00:01:50.850> plug<00:01:50.970> your<00:01:51.060> power<00:01:51.270> in<00:01:51.450> of

00:01:51.560 --> 00:01:51.570 
don't forget to plug your power in of

00:01:51.570 --> 00:01:55.160 
don't forget to plug your power in of
course<00:01:51.810> so<00:01:53.390> you<00:01:54.390> plug<00:01:54.570> your<00:01:54.630> one<00:01:54.899> and<00:01:54.930> six
