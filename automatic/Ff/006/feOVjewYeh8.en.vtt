00:00:02.667 --> 00:00:06.177
Disney's Planet Challenge is a Project Based Environmental competition

00:00:06.177 --> 00:00:09.177
For 3rd to 8th graders. And as the Program Manager,

00:00:09.180 --> 00:00:12.500
I am so excited to travel across the country this year and meet

00:00:12.558 --> 00:00:15.958
some of these incredible teachers and talented students. 

00:00:15.960 --> 00:00:19.000
all working to create a planet only they can imagine. 

00:00:19.012 --> 00:00:29.856
(upbeat music)

00:00:29.856 --> 00:00:33.708
On this adventure, I'm headed to Central Intermediate School

00:00:33.708 --> 00:00:38.333
In Baton Rouge, Louisiana. Between the hurricanes and the oil spills

00:00:38.333 --> 00:00:42.167
Louisiana has seen more than its share. So I was very

00:00:42.167 --> 00:00:45.792
intrigued when I heard of Mrs. Cress' 4th grade project to preserve the Wetlands.

00:00:46.958 --> 00:00:52.042
My kids were very devastated to see the Wetlands. That were covered in oil and

00:00:52.044 --> 00:00:55.417
and that our habitat was being destroyed. I said we need to do 

00:00:55.417 --> 00:00:58.167
something with the Wetlands. I said you know, what about the grasses?

00:00:58.167 --> 00:01:00.458
So we came up with a phrase called Saving the Wetlands 

00:01:00.458 --> 00:01:04.292
One Plant at a Time. And we're going to strengthen the rhizome 

00:01:04.292 --> 00:01:07.542
which is the underground stem. Maybe that will help 

00:01:07.542 --> 00:01:08.667
strengthen the Wetlands. 

00:01:08.667 --> 00:01:12.417
What inspired you to actually, take the plunge and join 

00:01:12.417 --> 00:01:14.250
Disney's Planet Challenge this year?

00:01:14.250 --> 00:01:17.250
We have a generation of students that are, they're indoor based. 

00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:21.750
One mother told me, she said, "My child doesn't like the outdoors.

00:01:21.750 --> 00:01:24.542
He'll only play video games."  and I said, "well you know what, I think 

00:01:24.542 --> 00:01:31.625
I'm going to change that." (upbeat music)

00:01:31.625 --> 00:01:36.583
I pledge allegiance to the flag of the United States of America. 

00:01:36.583 --> 00:01:41.750
Okay, today we're gonna make the imitation fresh water biome. 

00:01:41.875 --> 00:01:51.208
(upbeat music)

00:01:51.208 --> 00:01:55.625
So, we're working on saving the underground root. Which is the  rhizome.

00:01:55.625 --> 00:01:59.792
Trying to get that rhizome stronger. Well we're helping the Wetlands

00:01:59.833 --> 00:02:03.909
Which will help Louisiana a bunch because it's like a  

00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:06.708
speed bump for hurricanes. The ways the Wetlands help the oceans

00:02:06.708 --> 00:02:10.583
is the Wetlands help the oceans stay clean. 

00:02:10.583 --> 00:02:15.512
We're actually doing something instead of reading about something. 

00:02:15.512 --> 00:02:19.208
I think we're gonna make a diference because it's helping the earth. 

00:02:19.208 --> 00:02:23.605
 helping Louisiana. And mostly having fun. I wanted to learn more

00:02:23.625 --> 00:02:26.875
about the role of Wetlands in our Ecosystem.  So I headed down to 

00:02:26.876 --> 00:02:28.763
New Orleans for a swamp tour. 

00:02:31.125 --> 00:02:34.125
(engine starts)

00:02:34.130 --> 00:02:36.750
Right now we're in a swamp. And it's a beautiful swamp. 

00:02:36.725 --> 00:02:41.458
In the last 70 years or so, we've lost a enough wetlands to equal the size

00:02:41.458 --> 00:02:45.208
of the state of Delaware. If we didn't have the Wetlands agricultural runoff,

00:02:45.208 --> 00:02:48.292
animal waste and sewage created by humans would go straight 

00:02:48.292 --> 00:02:52.550
into the ocean. There's a purification that's going on.  There are microbes that

00:02:52.560 --> 00:02:55.583
are only found in our marshes that can break those things down. 

00:02:55.590 --> 00:02:58.500
and there are plants that can safely absorb them. Basically they are

00:02:58.505 --> 00:03:01.417
pulling those pollutants out of the system where they would otherwise be 

00:03:01.423 --> 00:03:04.375
dangerous and bad to have. To see just how far reaching this project

00:03:04.375 --> 00:03:09.150
can be. I went to see my friend, Dr. Andy Stamper at Epcot's The Seas.

00:03:09.542 --> 00:03:13.375
He was inspired to become a biologist and veterinarian by seeing the loss

00:03:13.375 --> 00:03:16.500
of Wetlands in his own home state of Indiana. Dr. Andy, can you tell

00:03:16.500 --> 00:03:20.000
us why it's important for kids to do these kind of projects at such a young

00:03:20.008 --> 00:03:25.625
age. Those projects that students are doing are helping to guide people 

00:03:25.625 --> 00:03:30.250
on how to best restore the environment. And it's extremely important from early

00:03:30.250 --> 00:03:35.750
ages to be able to be engaged and be able to be stewards for nature. 

00:03:35.750 --> 00:03:40.208
in the future. And what we're hoping to do is to inspire children to help restore

00:03:40.208 --> 00:03:43.208
nature to it's better self. 

00:03:46.042 --> 00:03:50.458
Being surrounded by this magical world around me, it put into perspective

00:03:50.458 --> 00:03:54.958
the impact that one classroom, through creativity and big imaginations can 

00:03:54.958 --> 00:03:57.500
have to make a difference for a healthier planet. 

00:03:57.500 --> 00:04:01.208
I was honored to spend time with Mrs. Cress and her students.
