00:00:00.320 --> 00:00:04.290
 not only the 12 of confectionery that makes pellets known nationally 

00:00:04.290 --> 00:00:09.679
 we also the psd and derivatives as of arrival and of course with 

00:00:09.679 --> 00:00:11.999
 the harbor 

00:00:11.999 --> 00:00:16.019
 the city is the largest producer of fruit in Brazil along with the others 

00:00:16.019 --> 00:00:20.599
 municipalities of the southern half of the state is responsible for 90% of the 

00:00:20.599 --> 00:00:23.599
 peach for processing 

00:00:24.220 --> 00:00:27.220
 in the column of pellets it is not difficult to locate the orchards 

00:00:27.749 --> 00:00:31.539
 there are approximately one thousand and five hundred producers who are part 

00:00:31.539 --> 00:00:33.320
 production of fish 

00:00:33.320 --> 00:00:37.810
 producers as if I would give voice in berlin began to work with peach 

00:00:37.810 --> 00:00:40.970
 following the family business and the correct 

00:00:40.970 --> 00:00:43.280
 in charge of red 

00:00:43.280 --> 00:00:45.879
 I inherited from my father everything is so close. 

00:00:45.879 --> 00:00:49.940
 my father-in-law transplanted realized they are still playing guitar and in the same 

00:00:49.940 --> 00:00:50.980
 old pace 

00:00:50.980 --> 00:00:54.060
 I still remember that when I entered college at times while browsing 

00:00:54.060 --> 00:00:56.270
 clothing latella for the arts 

00:00:56.270 --> 00:00:57.270
 hang with your father 

00:00:57.270 --> 00:01:00.880
 I'd kill poop class inherit these 40 years ago. 

00:01:03.050 --> 00:01:04.409
 today santa rita 

00:01:04.409 --> 00:01:07.920
 who is president of the gaucho association of peach producers 

00:01:07.920 --> 00:01:09.380
 the c30 and lacking 

00:01:09.380 --> 00:01:13.500
 with more than 30 thousand feet of peach trees and coli per year on average 300 

00:01:13.500 --> 00:01:16.870
 tonnes of fruit, the bulk of which was destined for the 

00:01:17.900 --> 00:01:22.050
 almost never especially to repair conserves for the industry 

00:01:22.050 --> 00:01:25.229
 know about the purchase in the market but 

00:01:25.229 --> 00:01:28.540
 the sata 2008 and 2009 has already begun 

00:01:28.540 --> 00:01:31.540
 this is a period that moves the economy of the region 

00:01:33.500 --> 00:01:37.030
 in the opinion of hyper-chemicals and producers 

00:01:37.030 --> 00:01:42.260
 this peach safflower should reach around fifty thousand tons 

00:01:42.860 --> 00:01:44.930
 this represents 

00:01:44.930 --> 00:01:51.500
 for 30 years of funds the circulation of approximately 40 million reais 

00:01:51.500 --> 00:01:52.540
 but this period 

00:01:52.540 --> 00:01:56.670
 is also delicate despite the good expectations for this harvest the 

00:01:56.670 --> 00:02:00.070
 climatic conditions in recent months who are worried by farmers 

00:02:00.890 --> 00:02:04.890
 the dry time affect fruit size which ends up reflecting in the price 

00:02:06.320 --> 00:02:08.379
 a prolonged drought 

00:02:08.379 --> 00:02:14.680
 ah, according to the poor, it is not bad, and sometimes there is a fall of 

00:02:14.680 --> 00:02:17.339
 The product of drop was leticia 

00:02:17.339 --> 00:02:21.239
 has the good side is that normally the fungal diseases also decrease 

00:02:21.239 --> 00:02:23.109
 while clement the more stays nor 

00:02:23.109 --> 00:02:27.639
 so we these days have had a little - you problems 

00:02:27.639 --> 00:02:29.759
 with purchasing power given that we had 

00:02:29.759 --> 00:02:34.069
 the screen a few weeks ago we are still at the beginning of the harvest and 

00:02:34.069 --> 00:02:35.690
 a lot can happen 

00:02:35.690 --> 00:02:38.229
 some losses may occur 

00:02:38.229 --> 00:02:43.539
 but by the way that we donate and it is possible that until the end of the saga 

00:02:43.539 --> 00:02:48.819
 the producer is able to achieve the desired production, the problem is 

00:02:48.819 --> 00:02:52.669
 producer problem that is historical is the question of price 

00:02:52.669 --> 00:02:59.399
 it is estimated that the price of this room will be around 75 to 80 cents a 

00:02:59.399 --> 00:03:03.850
 of factors that allowed the producer a room was the longest educational 

00:03:03.850 --> 00:03:06.659
 is the diversity of cultivars 

00:03:06.659 --> 00:03:10.599
 thanks to genetic improvement research, the role of people such as 

00:03:10.599 --> 00:03:12.979
 doctor maria do carmo 

00:03:12.979 --> 00:03:14.870
 regarding 

00:03:14.870 --> 00:03:17.870
 the part of this improvement 

00:03:22.450 --> 00:03:25.019
 mainly higher incidence of diseases 

00:03:25.019 --> 00:03:27.119
 It's that I have quality. 

00:03:27.119 --> 00:03:31.499
 20 are competitive in the market and 

00:03:31.499 --> 00:03:32.879
 our climate 

00:03:32.879 --> 00:03:35.190
 the development of a new cultivar 

00:03:35.190 --> 00:03:39.560
 it is a hard work it may take more than ten years to come to fruition is a 

00:03:39.560 --> 00:03:41.200
 work is a job 

00:03:41.200 --> 00:03:43.809
 Let's say you need some. 

00:03:43.809 --> 00:03:47.789
 patience and patience because normally the development of a 

00:03:47.789 --> 00:03:52.129
 cultivate if everything goes right from the start with a lot of luck the 

00:03:52.129 --> 00:03:54.439
 achieves in 10 12 years 

00:03:54.439 --> 00:03:57.540
 but once you have a program in progress we always have a material 

00:03:57.540 --> 00:03:59.899
 new world 

00:03:59.899 --> 00:04:02.749
 at least tested at the producer level 

00:04:02.749 --> 00:04:03.459
 or 

00:04:03.459 --> 00:04:04.399
 ah 

00:04:04.399 --> 00:04:06.889
 maybe even launch as quality 

00:04:06.889 --> 00:04:09.730
 if I would give is one of the beneficiaries with the research 

00:04:09.730 --> 00:04:14.170
 in his property he plants 12 different cultivars defended the loss 

00:04:14.170 --> 00:04:15.419
 of sensation 

00:04:15.419 --> 00:04:17.540
 discover more beautiful more great 

00:04:17.540 --> 00:04:18.989
 more colorful 

00:04:18.989 --> 00:04:22.729
 I think it's very good because if not our race rafa will stay 

00:04:23.520 --> 00:04:25.449
 too much color 

00:04:25.449 --> 00:04:27.900
 if you do not have several options 

00:04:27.900 --> 00:04:30.569
 You can start with it now and until January. 

00:04:30.569 --> 00:04:34.979
 if not I will reap fourteen days I will go to a week 2 to 0 and return to harvest 

00:04:34.979 --> 00:04:39.119
 so I plant according to these same ones of said begins now and not to 

00:04:39.119 --> 00:04:40.610
 the land 

00:04:40.610 --> 00:04:42.229
 the singer 

00:04:42.229 --> 00:04:46.659
 and so it works research we look for solutions for agriculture of the region 

00:04:46.659 --> 00:04:48.930
 side by side with the producer 

00:04:48.930 --> 00:04:50.219
 in sinop cheering 

00:04:50.219 --> 00:04:51.599
 good results 

00:04:51.599 --> 00:04:54.830
 we care about what our function really is 

00:04:54.830 --> 00:04:59.669
 is to bring benefit to them to win and if the thing is bad for them of certain 

00:04:59.669 --> 00:05:01.610
 way is bad for us too 

00:05:01.610 --> 00:05:04.180
 therefore we hope that the producers in the 

00:05:04.180 --> 00:05:08.340
 have a good remuneration and that the next vintages almost certainly 

00:05:08.340 --> 00:05:10.969
 positive reflection of what happened in the
