the<00:00:13.080> single<00:00:13.469> stroke<00:00:13.650> four<00:00:13.980> has<00:00:14.519> two<00:00:14.789> distinct

00:00:15.310 --> 00:00:15.320 
the single stroke four has two distinct

00:00:15.320 --> 00:00:17.330 
the single stroke four has two distinct
interpretations<00:00:16.320> there<00:00:16.710> can<00:00:16.859> be<00:00:16.890> more<00:00:17.189> but

00:00:17.330 --> 00:00:17.340 
interpretations there can be more but

00:00:17.340 --> 00:00:19.189 
interpretations there can be more but
there's<00:00:17.550> two<00:00:17.760> that<00:00:17.910> are<00:00:17.970> very<00:00:18.210> common<00:00:18.689> the

00:00:19.189 --> 00:00:19.199 
there's two that are very common the

00:00:19.199 --> 00:00:21.500 
there's two that are very common the
first<00:00:19.470> one<00:00:19.710> is<00:00:19.830> to<00:00:20.100> use<00:00:20.130> the<00:00:21.000> single<00:00:21.359> stroke

00:00:21.500 --> 00:00:21.510 
first one is to use the single stroke

00:00:21.510 --> 00:00:24.620 
first one is to use the single stroke
for<00:00:21.750> in<00:00:21.840> a<00:00:21.900> very<00:00:22.109> metric<00:00:23.150> quantized<00:00:24.150> way<00:00:24.419> as

00:00:24.620 --> 00:00:24.630 
for in a very metric quantized way as

00:00:24.630 --> 00:00:29.060 
for in a very metric quantized way as
six<00:00:25.050> tuplets<00:00:25.640> we're<00:00:26.640> going<00:00:26.759> to<00:00:26.820> start<00:00:27.529> on<00:00:28.529> the

00:00:29.060 --> 00:00:29.070 
six tuplets we're going to start on the

00:00:29.070 --> 00:00:30.919 
six tuplets we're going to start on the
right<00:00:29.249> hand<00:00:29.579> as<00:00:29.759> well<00:00:30.150> as<00:00:30.329> the<00:00:30.359> left<00:00:30.659> hand

00:00:30.919 --> 00:00:30.929 
right hand as well as the left hand

00:00:30.929 --> 00:00:33.050 
right hand as well as the left hand
important<00:00:31.439> to<00:00:31.499> start<00:00:31.739> the<00:00:31.980> rudiment<00:00:32.730> when<00:00:32.940> it

00:00:33.050 --> 00:00:33.060 
important to start the rudiment when it

00:00:33.060 --> 00:00:34.460 
important to start the rudiment when it
starts<00:00:33.329> on<00:00:33.420> the<00:00:33.450> right<00:00:33.690> ends<00:00:34.020> on<00:00:34.140> the<00:00:34.230> left

00:00:34.460 --> 00:00:34.470 
starts on the right ends on the left

00:00:34.470 --> 00:00:36.110 
starts on the right ends on the left
starts<00:00:35.040> on<00:00:35.130> the<00:00:35.190> left<00:00:35.220> it<00:00:35.579> will<00:00:35.700> end<00:00:35.880> on<00:00:36.000> the

00:00:36.110 --> 00:00:36.120 
starts on the left it will end on the

00:00:36.120 --> 00:00:38.750 
starts on the left it will end on the
right<00:00:36.300> here's<00:00:36.870> a<00:00:36.930> little<00:00:36.989> exercise<00:00:37.680> you<00:00:38.100> can

00:00:38.750 --> 00:00:38.760 
right here's a little exercise you can

00:00:38.760 --> 00:00:57.860 
right here's a little exercise you can
do<00:00:38.970> to<00:00:39.540> work<00:00:39.720> on<00:00:39.900> that<00:00:55.400> these<00:00:56.400> are<00:00:56.610> all<00:00:56.870> rebound

00:00:57.860 --> 00:00:57.870 
do to work on that these are all rebound

00:00:57.870 --> 00:01:00.230 
do to work on that these are all rebound
strokes<00:00:58.350> this<00:00:58.680> should<00:00:58.890> be<00:00:59.040> very<00:00:59.340> simple<00:00:59.910> to<00:01:00.030> do

00:01:00.230 --> 00:01:00.240 
strokes this should be very simple to do

00:01:00.240 --> 00:01:02.990 
strokes this should be very simple to do
when<00:01:00.870> you<00:01:00.960> play<00:01:01.200> it<00:01:01.350> slow<00:01:01.770> like<00:01:02.070> that<00:01:02.430> make

00:01:02.990 --> 00:01:03.000 
when you play it slow like that make

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:04.609 
when you play it slow like that make
sure<00:01:03.030> everything<00:01:03.660> is<00:01:03.690> rebounding<00:01:04.500> and

00:01:04.609 --> 00:01:04.619 
sure everything is rebounding and

00:01:04.619 --> 00:01:07.730 
sure everything is rebounding and
there's<00:01:04.769> no<00:01:04.920> tension<00:01:05.339> in<00:01:05.759> your<00:01:05.939> playing<00:01:06.240> as<00:01:06.740> I

00:01:07.730 --> 00:01:07.740 
there's no tension in your playing as I

00:01:07.740 --> 00:01:10.219 
there's no tension in your playing as I
speed<00:01:08.040> it<00:01:08.070> up<00:01:08.310> all<00:01:09.060> I'm<00:01:09.329> going<00:01:09.479> to<00:01:09.540> do<00:01:09.750> is<00:01:09.960> lower

00:01:10.219 --> 00:01:10.229 
speed it up all I'm going to do is lower

00:01:10.229 --> 00:01:12.410 
speed it up all I'm going to do is lower
my<00:01:10.439> stick<00:01:10.710> Heights<00:01:10.980> that's<00:01:11.880> the<00:01:12.120> only

00:01:12.410 --> 00:01:12.420 
my stick Heights that's the only

00:01:12.420 --> 00:01:23.680 
my stick Heights that's the only
difference<00:01:12.570> it's<00:01:13.020> the<00:01:13.080> same<00:01:13.350> technique

00:01:23.680 --> 00:01:23.690 

00:01:23.690 --> 00:01:26.210 

another<00:01:24.690> way<00:01:24.930> of<00:01:24.960> playing<00:01:25.229> it<00:01:25.560> is<00:01:25.710> to

00:01:26.210 --> 00:01:26.220 
another way of playing it is to

00:01:26.220 --> 00:01:28.640 
another way of playing it is to
alternate<00:01:26.729> play<00:01:27.210> one<00:01:27.509> on<00:01:27.659> the<00:01:27.780> right<00:01:27.990> and<00:01:28.200> then

00:01:28.640 --> 00:01:28.650 
alternate play one on the right and then

00:01:28.650 --> 00:01:43.249 
alternate play one on the right and then
one<00:01:28.920> on<00:01:28.950> the<00:01:29.130> left<00:01:29.490> a<00:01:36.020> little<00:01:37.020> faster<00:01:42.259> another

00:01:43.249 --> 00:01:43.259 
one on the left a little faster another

00:01:43.259 --> 00:01:45.410 
one on the left a little faster another
way<00:01:43.470> to<00:01:43.530> interpret<00:01:44.009> this<00:01:44.220> rudiment<00:01:44.909> is<00:01:45.000> as<00:01:45.390> a

00:01:45.410 --> 00:01:45.420 
way to interpret this rudiment is as a

00:01:45.420 --> 00:01:47.420 
way to interpret this rudiment is as a
four-stroke<00:01:46.020> truck<00:01:46.290> and<00:01:46.500> this<00:01:46.799> is<00:01:46.979> very

00:01:47.420 --> 00:01:47.430 
four-stroke truck and this is very

00:01:47.430 --> 00:01:51.230 
four-stroke truck and this is very
common<00:01:47.820> in<00:01:48.210> orchestral<00:01:49.170> literature<00:01:49.970> it's<00:01:50.970> not

00:01:51.230 --> 00:01:51.240 
common in orchestral literature it's not

00:01:51.240 --> 00:01:54.889 
common in orchestral literature it's not
necessarily<00:01:51.960> as<00:01:52.140> six<00:01:52.860> tuplets<00:01:53.340> it<00:01:53.520> can<00:01:53.880> be<00:01:54.090> but

00:01:54.889 --> 00:01:54.899 
necessarily as six tuplets it can be but

00:01:54.899 --> 00:01:56.960 
necessarily as six tuplets it can be but
the<00:01:55.020> interpretation<00:01:55.289> is<00:01:55.979> basically<00:01:56.610> three

00:01:56.960 --> 00:01:56.970 
the interpretation is basically three

00:01:56.970 --> 00:01:59.749 
the interpretation is basically three
grace<00:01:57.479> notes<00:01:57.780> three<00:01:58.320> ornaments<00:01:58.800> into<00:01:59.280> the

00:01:59.749 --> 00:01:59.759 
grace notes three ornaments into the

00:01:59.759 --> 00:02:02.450 
grace notes three ornaments into the
primary<00:02:00.300> note<00:02:00.569> and<00:02:00.780> it's<00:02:01.679> going<00:02:01.920> to<00:02:01.979> be<00:02:02.220> at

00:02:02.450 --> 00:02:02.460 
primary note and it's going to be at

00:02:02.460 --> 00:02:05.300 
primary note and it's going to be at
your<00:02:02.970> own<00:02:03.179> discretion<00:02:03.600> or<00:02:04.229> your<00:02:05.100> own

00:02:05.300 --> 00:02:05.310 
your own discretion or your own

00:02:05.310 --> 00:02:15.259 
your own discretion or your own
interpretation<00:02:06.030> I'll<00:02:06.690> demonstrate<00:02:14.000> also<00:02:15.000> try

00:02:15.259 --> 00:02:15.269 
interpretation I'll demonstrate also try

00:02:15.269 --> 00:02:23.420 
interpretation I'll demonstrate also try
starting<00:02:15.600> it<00:02:15.840> with<00:02:16.050> the<00:02:16.200> right<00:02:20.720> as<00:02:22.190> I<00:02:23.190> said

00:02:23.420 --> 00:02:23.430 
starting it with the right as I said

00:02:23.430 --> 00:02:26.300 
starting it with the right as I said
this<00:02:23.519> is<00:02:23.640> very<00:02:24.000> common<00:02:24.600> in<00:02:25.310> orchestral

00:02:26.300 --> 00:02:26.310 
this is very common in orchestral

00:02:26.310 --> 00:02:29.390 
this is very common in orchestral
literature<00:02:26.700> one<00:02:27.209> very<00:02:27.780> popular<00:02:28.260> excerpt<00:02:29.250> is

00:02:29.390 --> 00:02:29.400 
literature one very popular excerpt is

00:02:29.400 --> 00:02:41.960 
literature one very popular excerpt is
the<00:02:29.970> 1812<00:02:30.540> overture<00:02:40.100> there<00:02:41.100> are<00:02:41.280> several<00:02:41.640> ways

00:02:41.960 --> 00:02:41.970 
the 1812 overture there are several ways

00:02:41.970 --> 00:02:44.539 
the 1812 overture there are several ways
you<00:02:42.030> can<00:02:42.329> break<00:02:42.750> down<00:02:43.079> a<00:02:43.410> single<00:02:43.980> stroke<00:02:44.220> for

00:02:44.539 --> 00:02:44.549 
you can break down a single stroke for

00:02:44.549 --> 00:02:46.400 
you can break down a single stroke for
and<00:02:44.820> they're<00:02:45.390> all<00:02:45.540> correct<00:02:45.930> they're<00:02:46.230> just

00:02:46.400 --> 00:02:46.410 
and they're all correct they're just

00:02:46.410 --> 00:02:49.910 
and they're all correct they're just
different<00:02:47.130> ways<00:02:47.780> the<00:02:48.780> first<00:02:48.810> way<00:02:49.170> would<00:02:49.470> be<00:02:49.530> to

00:02:49.910 --> 00:02:49.920 
different ways the first way would be to

00:02:49.920 --> 00:02:52.069 
different ways the first way would be to
play<00:02:50.489> them<00:02:50.640> all<00:02:50.850> starting<00:02:51.630> with<00:02:51.660> the<00:02:51.870> right

00:02:52.069 --> 00:02:52.079 
play them all starting with the right

00:02:52.079 --> 00:03:08.480 
play them all starting with the right
hand<00:02:52.470> as<00:02:52.680> six<00:02:53.519> tuplets<00:02:54.030> I'll<00:02:54.359> demonstrate

00:03:08.480 --> 00:03:08.490 

00:03:08.490 --> 00:03:11.250 

and<00:03:09.490> so<00:03:10.120> forth<00:03:10.450> and<00:03:10.630> then<00:03:10.750> slow<00:03:10.990> it<00:03:11.080> back<00:03:11.110> down

00:03:11.250 --> 00:03:11.260 
and so forth and then slow it back down

00:03:11.260 --> 00:03:14.100 
and so forth and then slow it back down
another<00:03:12.130> way<00:03:12.400> would<00:03:12.760> be<00:03:12.820> to<00:03:13.000> alternate<00:03:13.780> it<00:03:13.900> or

00:03:14.100 --> 00:03:14.110 
another way would be to alternate it or

00:03:14.110 --> 00:03:15.870 
another way would be to alternate it or
just<00:03:14.740> start<00:03:14.980> with<00:03:15.100> the<00:03:15.190> left<00:03:15.370> hand<00:03:15.550> well<00:03:15.790> we're

00:03:15.870 --> 00:03:15.880 
just start with the left hand well we're

00:03:15.880 --> 00:03:17.670 
just start with the left hand well we're
going<00:03:15.970> to<00:03:16.030> we're<00:03:16.300> going<00:03:16.330> to<00:03:16.480> alternate<00:03:17.080> do<00:03:17.470> one

00:03:17.670 --> 00:03:17.680 
going to we're going to alternate do one

00:03:17.680 --> 00:03:32.600 
going to we're going to alternate do one
on<00:03:17.800> the<00:03:17.860> right<00:03:18.100> and<00:03:18.340> then<00:03:18.820> one<00:03:19.000> on<00:03:19.090> the<00:03:19.150> left

00:03:32.600 --> 00:03:32.610 

00:03:32.610 --> 00:03:36.180 

now<00:03:33.610> another<00:03:34.030> way<00:03:34.300> is<00:03:34.540> to<00:03:34.720> play<00:03:34.930> them<00:03:35.080> as<00:03:35.230> an
