00:00:37.819 --> 00:00:37.829 
that the system generates most of the

00:00:37.829 --> 00:00:40.010 
that the system generates most of the
time<00:00:38.040> it<00:00:38.160> generates<00:00:38.550> the<00:00:38.730> same<00:00:38.940> one<00:00:39.210> but<00:00:39.870> you

00:00:40.010 --> 00:00:40.020 
time it generates the same one but you

00:00:40.020 --> 00:00:43.310
