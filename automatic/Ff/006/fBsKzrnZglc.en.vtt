hello<00:00:12.030> I'm<00:00:12.300> here<00:00:12.599> in<00:00:12.690> some<00:00:12.870> head<00:00:13.019> for<00:00:13.230> today

00:00:13.400 --> 00:00:13.410 
hello I'm here in some head for today

00:00:13.410 --> 00:00:15.200 
hello I'm here in some head for today
and<00:00:13.650> we're<00:00:14.099> going<00:00:14.250> to<00:00:14.280> do<00:00:14.400> a<00:00:14.429> reaction<00:00:14.759> where<00:00:15.150> a

00:00:15.200 --> 00:00:15.210 
and we're going to do a reaction where a

00:00:15.210 --> 00:00:19.060 
and we're going to do a reaction where a
shrinkage<00:00:15.660> to<00:00:15.809> burn<00:00:16.139> guttural<00:00:17.270> now<00:00:18.270> glycerol

00:00:19.060 --> 00:00:19.070 
shrinkage to burn guttural now glycerol

00:00:19.070 --> 00:00:21.349 
shrinkage to burn guttural now glycerol
molecule<00:00:20.070> casserole<00:00:20.760> looks<00:00:20.970> a<00:00:21.029> little<00:00:21.180> bit

00:00:21.349 --> 00:00:21.359 
molecule casserole looks a little bit

00:00:21.359 --> 00:00:25.330 
molecule casserole looks a little bit
like<00:00:21.539> the<00:00:21.840> molecule<00:00:22.230> of<00:00:23.060> glucose<00:00:24.060> sugar<00:00:24.300> and

00:00:25.330 --> 00:00:25.340 
like the molecule of glucose sugar and

00:00:25.340 --> 00:00:27.920 
like the molecule of glucose sugar and
that<00:00:26.340> means<00:00:26.580> it<00:00:26.699> has<00:00:26.939> a<00:00:27.240> lot<00:00:27.660> of<00:00:27.689> energy

00:00:27.920 --> 00:00:27.930 
that means it has a lot of energy

00:00:27.930 --> 00:00:30.560 
that means it has a lot of energy
trapped<00:00:28.529> within<00:00:28.710> it<00:00:28.830> because<00:00:29.220> you<00:00:29.279> know<00:00:29.570> when

00:00:30.560 --> 00:00:30.570 
trapped within it because you know when

00:00:30.570 --> 00:00:32.900 
trapped within it because you know when
you<00:00:30.660> eat<00:00:30.750> sugar<00:00:31.109> it<00:00:31.439> can<00:00:31.650> get<00:00:31.740> up<00:00:31.980> to<00:00:32.009> energy<00:00:32.399> as

00:00:32.900 --> 00:00:32.910 
you eat sugar it can get up to energy as

00:00:32.910 --> 00:00:34.940 
you eat sugar it can get up to energy as
you<00:00:33.149> can<00:00:33.270> see<00:00:33.540> instead<00:00:34.440> of<00:00:34.500> being<00:00:34.649> a<00:00:34.739> white

00:00:34.940 --> 00:00:34.950 
you can see instead of being a white

00:00:34.950 --> 00:00:38.000 
you can see instead of being a white
solid<00:00:35.630> glycerol<00:00:36.630> is<00:00:36.660> this<00:00:36.899> sort<00:00:37.110> of<00:00:37.200> very

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:38.010 
solid glycerol is this sort of very

00:00:38.010 --> 00:00:41.420 
solid glycerol is this sort of very
gloopy<00:00:38.460> liquid<00:00:39.920> I'm<00:00:40.920> what<00:00:41.070> we're<00:00:41.160> going<00:00:41.250> to<00:00:41.340> do

00:00:41.420 --> 00:00:41.430 
gloopy liquid I'm what we're going to do

00:00:41.430 --> 00:00:44.810 
gloopy liquid I'm what we're going to do
today<00:00:41.610> is<00:00:42.260> instead<00:00:43.260> of<00:00:43.379> burning<00:00:44.309> in<00:00:44.579> oxygen

00:00:44.810 --> 00:00:44.820 
today is instead of burning in oxygen

00:00:44.820 --> 00:00:47.569 
today is instead of burning in oxygen
like<00:00:45.510> we<00:00:45.629> usually<00:00:45.780> do<00:00:46.140> we're<00:00:46.860> going<00:00:47.010> to<00:00:47.070> use<00:00:47.309> a

00:00:47.569 --> 00:00:47.579 
like we usually do we're going to use a

00:00:47.579 --> 00:00:49.010 
like we usually do we're going to use a
different<00:00:48.000> chemical<00:00:48.480> called<00:00:48.930> potassium

00:00:49.010 --> 00:00:49.020 
different chemical called potassium

00:00:49.020 --> 00:00:52.010 
different chemical called potassium
manganate<00:00:49.910> so<00:00:50.910> I'm<00:00:51.059> just<00:00:51.210> going<00:00:51.390> to<00:00:51.449> make<00:00:51.989> a

00:00:52.010 --> 00:00:52.020 
manganate so I'm just going to make a

00:00:52.020 --> 00:00:56.800 
manganate so I'm just going to make a
pile<00:00:52.320> that's<00:00:52.710> enjoying<00:00:53.100> it<00:00:53.309> here

00:00:56.800 --> 00:00:56.810 

00:00:56.810 --> 00:01:08.620 

ok

00:01:08.620 --> 00:01:08.630 

00:01:08.630 --> 00:01:11.679 

and<00:01:09.009> once<00:01:10.009> we've<00:01:10.189> got<00:01:10.219> that<00:01:10.399> there<00:01:10.820> will<00:01:11.570> this

00:01:11.679 --> 00:01:11.689 
and once we've got that there will this

00:01:11.689 --> 00:01:14.820 
and once we've got that there will this
adds<00:01:11.960> up<00:01:12.259> some<00:01:12.469> of<00:01:12.560> our<00:01:12.680> what's<00:01:13.009> wrong

00:01:14.820 --> 00:01:14.830 
adds up some of our what's wrong

00:01:14.830 --> 00:01:32.690 
adds up some of our what's wrong
and<00:01:14.950> after<00:01:15.790> we<00:01:15.880> wait<00:01:16.060> one<00:01:16.360> it<00:01:16.930> should<00:01:17.640> fire

00:01:32.690 --> 00:01:32.700 

00:01:32.700 --> 00:01:35.100 

now<00:01:33.700> this<00:01:33.790> is<00:01:33.880> quite<00:01:34.060> strange<00:01:34.390> reaction

00:01:35.100 --> 00:01:35.110 
now this is quite strange reaction

00:01:35.110 --> 00:01:36.149 
now this is quite strange reaction
because<00:01:35.259> we're<00:01:35.350> not<00:01:35.439> actually<00:01:35.560> having<00:01:35.860> to<00:01:35.890> use

00:01:36.149 --> 00:01:36.159 
because we're not actually having to use

00:01:36.159 --> 00:01:40.020 
because we're not actually having to use
any<00:01:36.430> flame<00:01:37.420> to<00:01:37.659> start<00:01:37.930> this<00:01:38.820> because<00:01:39.820> you<00:01:39.939> know

00:01:40.020 --> 00:01:40.030 
any flame to start this because you know

00:01:40.030 --> 00:01:42.149 
any flame to start this because you know
if<00:01:40.149> you<00:01:40.210> have<00:01:40.479> to<00:01:40.659> usually<00:01:41.380> set<00:01:41.740> by<00:01:41.890> something

00:01:42.149 --> 00:01:42.159 
if you have to usually set by something

00:01:42.159 --> 00:01:44.130 
if you have to usually set by something
you<00:01:42.250> had<00:01:42.369> to<00:01:42.399> have<00:01:43.000> a<00:01:43.030> soft<00:01:43.299> as<00:01:43.420> a<00:01:43.450> source<00:01:44.080> of

00:01:44.130 --> 00:01:44.140 
you had to have a soft as a source of

00:01:44.140 --> 00:01:46.350 
you had to have a soft as a source of
ignition<00:01:44.259> like<00:01:44.649> that<00:01:44.860> a<00:01:45.100> match<00:01:45.640> or<00:01:45.880> a<00:01:45.939> spark<00:01:46.240> or

00:01:46.350 --> 00:01:46.360 
ignition like that a match or a spark or

00:01:46.360 --> 00:01:49.830 
ignition like that a match or a spark or
something

00:01:49.830 --> 00:01:49.840 

00:01:49.840 --> 00:01:52.050 

and<00:01:50.079> the<00:01:50.619> reason<00:01:50.740> why<00:01:50.890> we<00:01:51.009> can<00:01:51.159> do<00:01:51.340> this<00:01:51.549> is

00:01:52.050 --> 00:01:52.060 
and the reason why we can do this is

00:01:52.060 --> 00:01:54.179 
and the reason why we can do this is
because<00:01:52.299> the<00:01:52.780> potassium<00:01:53.289> permanganate<00:01:53.679> has

00:01:54.179 --> 00:01:54.189 
because the potassium permanganate has

00:01:54.189 --> 00:01:57.810 
because the potassium permanganate has
lots<00:01:54.729> and<00:01:54.880> lots<00:01:55.060> of<00:01:55.149> oxygen<00:01:55.450> crap<00:01:55.780> in<00:01:56.020> it<00:01:56.820> as

00:01:57.810 --> 00:01:57.820 
lots and lots of oxygen crap in it as

00:01:57.820 --> 00:01:59.700 
lots and lots of oxygen crap in it as
well<00:01:57.880> as<00:01:58.179> having<00:01:58.329> ops<00:01:58.600> unit<00:01:59.079> it's<00:01:59.350> got<00:01:59.530> some

00:01:59.700 --> 00:01:59.710 
well as having ops unit it's got some

00:01:59.710 --> 00:02:02.130 
well as having ops unit it's got some
manganese<00:02:00.189> which<00:02:00.460> is<00:02:01.149> a<00:02:01.179> metal<00:02:01.780> unique<00:02:02.049> in

00:02:02.130 --> 00:02:02.140 
manganese which is a metal unique in

00:02:02.140 --> 00:02:05.399 
manganese which is a metal unique in
your<00:02:02.259> body<00:02:02.500> for<00:02:02.979> you<00:02:03.039> to<00:02:03.189> live<00:02:03.569> and<00:02:04.569> also<00:02:05.200> has

00:02:05.399 --> 00:02:05.409 
your body for you to live and also has

00:02:05.409 --> 00:02:09.300 
your body for you to live and also has
some<00:02:05.890> potassium<00:02:06.189> in<00:02:06.549> it<00:02:07.500> which<00:02:08.500> you<00:02:08.619> which<00:02:09.190> you

00:02:09.300 --> 00:02:09.310 
some potassium in it which you which you

00:02:09.310 --> 00:02:12.180 
some potassium in it which you which you
can<00:02:09.429> tell<00:02:09.700> because<00:02:10.360> it<00:02:10.840> had<00:02:11.110> this<00:02:11.590> nice<00:02:11.860> purple

00:02:12.180 --> 00:02:12.190 
can tell because it had this nice purple

00:02:12.190 --> 00:02:30.460 
can tell because it had this nice purple
flame

00:02:30.460 --> 00:02:30.470 

00:02:30.470 --> 00:02:32.530 

you
