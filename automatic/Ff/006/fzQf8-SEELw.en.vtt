00:00:06.859 --> 00:00:13.740
 today I came to see us until our 

00:00:09.840 --> 00:00:17.280
 hello concha or hello shell how are you 

00:00:13.740 --> 00:00:20.910
 she is a graduate in fine arts 

00:00:17.280 --> 00:00:23.870
 then she is also a worshiping teacher of the 

00:00:20.910 --> 00:00:27.470
 guild foundation school 

00:00:23.870 --> 00:00:31.340
 she also owns a school of 

00:00:27.470 --> 00:00:35.060
 restoration and also if I am here 

00:00:31.340 --> 00:00:38.000
 That's why she's the one that 

00:00:35.060 --> 00:00:41.210
 started in all this then I left 

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:45.590
 expanding my little thing clear but thanks to 

00:00:41.210 --> 00:00:47.739
 she is here then he has brought her 

00:00:45.590 --> 00:00:51.230
 has called because we have extra 

00:00:47.739 --> 00:00:54.800
 shutter that is great and 

00:00:51.230 --> 00:00:57.559
 we want to finish the sidewalk I thought that 

00:00:54.800 --> 00:01:00.320
 although there are many brands of waxes 

00:00:57.559 --> 00:01:03.140
 commercials it is true that they are sold 

00:01:00.320 --> 00:01:04.910
 very many but people can also 

00:01:03.140 --> 00:01:08.720
 know that as you have taught me 

00:01:04.910 --> 00:01:11.810
 always with things that we have to our 

00:01:08.720 --> 00:01:13.909
 scope we can make our own 

00:01:11.810 --> 00:01:15.980
 products if it 's true that we 

00:01:13.909 --> 00:01:18.950
 teach third 

00:01:15.980 --> 00:01:21.020
 very well then let's come to it good 

00:01:18.950 --> 00:01:24.060
 Well the truth is that to do 

00:01:21.020 --> 00:01:28.049
 our own waxes 

00:01:24.060 --> 00:01:31.799
 let's basically use this type 

00:01:28.049 --> 00:01:35.460
 of good wax this is the virgin wax that 

00:01:31.799 --> 00:01:38.460
 is a relatively soft wax melts to 

00:01:35.460 --> 00:01:40.409
 60 degrees centigrade more or less she 

00:01:38.460 --> 00:01:42.810
 is the basis on which we are going to start 

00:01:40.409 --> 00:01:44.549
 to work the wax although the mixture of 

00:01:42.810 --> 00:01:46.259
 the fabrics that we are going to use depends 

00:01:44.549 --> 00:01:49.350
 also of the hardness of the wood to the 

00:01:46.259 --> 00:01:52.920
 that we are going to apply there is not a mixture of 

00:01:49.350 --> 00:01:55.470
 basic waxes each makes the mixture that 

00:01:52.920 --> 00:01:57.330
 wants but we are going to make a 

00:01:55.470 --> 00:01:59.819
 mix equally 

00:01:57.330 --> 00:02:03.420
 let's use a proportional mixture 

00:01:59.819 --> 00:02:05.340
 microcrystalline wax wax bait 

00:02:03.420 --> 00:02:06.659
 and virgin wax it because we will 

00:02:05.340 --> 00:02:09.179
 start and then we 're going to get involved 

00:02:06.659 --> 00:02:10.679
 to see everything is what exactly and we are going 

00:02:09.179 --> 00:02:13.020
 to cut a piece of truth in 

00:02:10.679 --> 00:02:15.390
 bits 

00:02:13.020 --> 00:02:17.670
 to this mixture maria jesus we are going to add 

00:02:15.390 --> 00:02:20.280
 a piece of microcrystalline wax that 

00:02:17.670 --> 00:02:22.350
 it is extracted from the oil for this wax it 

00:02:20.280 --> 00:02:25.530
 used more or less at the beginning of 

00:02:22.350 --> 00:02:27.570
 20th century and this gives us strength and 

00:02:25.530 --> 00:02:29.280
 resistance and we also use it a lot 

00:02:27.570 --> 00:02:32.250
 in restoration because it does not attract dust 

00:02:29.280 --> 00:02:35.070
 this rebellious dust exactly is the 

00:02:32.250 --> 00:02:36.960
 quality that brings to the queen of the 

00:02:35.070 --> 00:02:38.370
 waxes that is wax spear was virgin and 

00:02:36.960 --> 00:02:39.990
 we arrived today putting the bathroom 

00:02:38.370 --> 00:02:42.260
 so that they are sold we put it to the bathroom 

00:02:39.990 --> 00:02:45.420
 Mary eye to put in the bathroom Mary 

00:02:42.260 --> 00:02:48.990
 always remember that we have to 

00:02:45.420 --> 00:02:52.350
 put a metal lid on the bottom of the 

00:02:48.990 --> 00:02:54.390
 pot and then we put on top the 

00:02:52.350 --> 00:02:57.510
 glass jar so that it does not jump 

00:02:54.390 --> 00:02:59.790
 crystal and we would throw the last 

00:02:57.510 --> 00:03:02.100
 Wax yes that is lacerating for him to play 

00:02:59.790 --> 00:03:04.260
 this bait yes and is what 

00:03:02.100 --> 00:03:07.020
 properties has good because this is the 

00:03:04.260 --> 00:03:10.500
 hardness and resistance to these and what 

00:03:07.020 --> 00:03:12.270
 we will use only crystallize is from 

00:03:10.500 --> 00:03:15.240
 vegetable origin 

00:03:12.270 --> 00:03:18.120
 a palm tree is extracted this palm tree 

00:03:15.240 --> 00:03:20.610
 It abounds a lot for example in Brazil 

00:03:18.120 --> 00:03:22.709
 This contributes as I tell you the hardness of 

00:03:20.610 --> 00:03:25.319
 ear and then slow we throw them 

00:03:22.709 --> 00:03:28.950
 also in equal parts to parts 

00:03:25.319 --> 00:03:30.780
 same good less for this amount 

00:03:28.950 --> 00:03:33.780
 let's take 

00:03:30.780 --> 00:03:33.780
 approximately 

00:03:33.940 --> 00:03:41.080
 6 for these little pieces that we have more 

00:03:37.300 --> 00:03:44.290
 prepare well now let's go let's do 

00:03:41.080 --> 00:03:46.750
 that will dissolve we will let it be 

00:03:44.290 --> 00:03:49.780
 dissolve and then we will continue with the 

00:03:46.750 --> 00:03:51.580
 last step to finish we would have 

00:03:49.780 --> 00:03:53.110
 dissolved 

00:03:51.580 --> 00:03:55.420
 the three spheres once they are 

00:03:53.110 --> 00:03:58.210
 dissolved if in this case we have 

00:03:55.420 --> 00:04:00.340
 microcrystalline wax mixed made 

00:03:58.210 --> 00:04:02.710
 Carna grape that have a melting point 

00:04:00.340 --> 00:04:05.140
 greater is to say that they are very hard wax 

00:04:02.710 --> 00:04:08.530
 hard we are going to do a concentration 

00:04:05.140 --> 00:04:11.170
 less than wax we add a lot 

00:04:08.530 --> 00:04:13.900
 more white water turpentine that's a 

00:04:11.170 --> 00:04:16.209
 third part wax and two thirds 

00:04:13.900 --> 00:04:18.370
 parts of the guarrate guards then 

00:04:16.209 --> 00:04:21.370
 more or less let's add up here from 

00:04:18.370 --> 00:04:24.910
 turpentine will always make the fira forgive 

00:04:21.370 --> 00:04:27.910
 to shell always do it by adding the 

00:04:24.910 --> 00:04:29.680
 turpentine out of the new game where 

00:04:27.910 --> 00:04:31.210
 we are doing 

00:04:29.680 --> 00:04:33.699
 to do in the water bath because it is 

00:04:31.210 --> 00:04:36.190
 flammable and then this is dangerous 

00:04:33.699 --> 00:04:38.680
 it always has to be outside 

00:04:36.190 --> 00:04:39.970
 and those leaves that we have of laurel and 

00:04:38.680 --> 00:04:42.940
 these laurel leaves 

00:04:39.970 --> 00:04:45.870
 we are going to incorporate them to the beast because 

00:04:42.940 --> 00:04:52.560
 they perform a fungicidal effect ie 

00:04:45.870 --> 00:04:55.520
 scare off insects to woodworms 

00:04:52.560 --> 00:04:57.800
 and aromatize our wax 

00:04:55.520 --> 00:05:00.460
 and already with this we would have prepared 

00:04:57.800 --> 00:05:04.539
 our a homemade orange 

00:05:00.460 --> 00:05:07.800
 It can be used in both the cold and 

00:05:04.539 --> 00:05:10.599
 in perfect hot we leave it like this already 

00:05:07.800 --> 00:05:13.389
 you can see now if they stay cool and 

00:05:10.599 --> 00:05:15.780
 you can see how we can put something in 

00:05:13.389 --> 00:05:17.630
 our house and with 

00:05:15.780 --> 00:05:20.280
 simple with simple products 

00:05:17.630 --> 00:05:22.760
 We can make our own waxes 

00:05:20.280 --> 00:05:25.470
 to apply to our furniture 

00:05:22.760 --> 00:05:29.930
 thank you very much shell and thanks for 

00:05:25.470 --> 00:05:29.930
 everything that has given me to move to you
