so<00:00:06.950> BMW<00:00:07.950> has<00:00:08.099> developed<00:00:08.519> their<00:00:08.639> cars<00:00:08.910> so<00:00:09.630> far

00:00:10.009 --> 00:00:10.019 
so BMW has developed their cars so far

00:00:10.019 --> 00:00:12.560 
so BMW has developed their cars so far
they<00:00:10.260> are<00:00:10.290> so<00:00:10.650> sophisticated<00:00:10.889> and<00:00:11.580> so<00:00:12.210> amazing

00:00:12.560 --> 00:00:12.570 
they are so sophisticated and so amazing

00:00:12.570 --> 00:00:14.870 
they are so sophisticated and so amazing
that<00:00:12.660> that<00:00:12.900> that<00:00:13.650> now<00:00:14.009> it's<00:00:14.219> time<00:00:14.400> to<00:00:14.519> elevate

00:00:14.870 --> 00:00:14.880 
that that that now it's time to elevate

00:00:14.880 --> 00:00:16.939 
that that that now it's time to elevate
the<00:00:14.910> drivers<00:00:15.389> how<00:00:15.750> do<00:00:15.809> they<00:00:15.960> do<00:00:16.020> it<00:00:16.289> they<00:00:16.680> do<00:00:16.740> it

00:00:16.939 --> 00:00:16.949 
the drivers how do they do it they do it

00:00:16.949 --> 00:00:19.160 
the drivers how do they do it they do it
the<00:00:17.070> exact<00:00:17.640> same<00:00:18.029> way<00:00:18.330> that<00:00:18.630> we<00:00:18.779> do<00:00:18.900> it<00:00:19.020> in<00:00:19.109> our

00:00:19.160 --> 00:00:19.170 
the exact same way that we do it in our

00:00:19.170 --> 00:00:21.080 
the exact same way that we do it in our
race<00:00:19.410> cars<00:00:19.619> they've<00:00:20.039> developed<00:00:20.279> an<00:00:20.550> app<00:00:20.760> that

00:00:21.080 --> 00:00:21.090 
race cars they've developed an app that

00:00:21.090 --> 00:00:23.540 
race cars they've developed an app that
after<00:00:21.779> you<00:00:21.869> go<00:00:22.050> around<00:00:22.470> a<00:00:22.560> lap<00:00:22.740> you<00:00:23.220> pull<00:00:23.460> up

00:00:23.540 --> 00:00:23.550 
after you go around a lap you pull up

00:00:23.550 --> 00:00:25.160 
after you go around a lap you pull up
the<00:00:23.640> app<00:00:23.760> you<00:00:24.150> look<00:00:24.359> at<00:00:24.510> you<00:00:24.779> can<00:00:24.930> see<00:00:25.050> the

00:00:25.160 --> 00:00:25.170 
the app you look at you can see the

00:00:25.170 --> 00:00:27.230 
the app you look at you can see the
performance<00:00:25.470> to<00:00:25.800> handling<00:00:26.189> the<00:00:26.340> breaking<00:00:26.880> the

00:00:27.230 --> 00:00:27.240 
performance to handling the breaking the

00:00:27.240 --> 00:00:29.419 
performance to handling the breaking the
g-force<00:00:27.720> that<00:00:27.930> turn<00:00:28.170> in<00:00:28.410> and<00:00:28.590> then<00:00:28.949> compare<00:00:29.369> it

00:00:29.419 --> 00:00:29.429 
g-force that turn in and then compare it

00:00:29.429 --> 00:00:31.999 
g-force that turn in and then compare it
lap<00:00:29.880> after<00:00:30.150> lap<00:00:30.330> you<00:00:31.109> can<00:00:31.260> find<00:00:31.500> a<00:00:31.560> better<00:00:31.590> way

00:00:31.999 --> 00:00:32.009 
lap after lap you can find a better way

00:00:32.009 --> 00:00:33.410 
lap after lap you can find a better way
when<00:00:32.189> you<00:00:32.250> see<00:00:32.399> a<00:00:32.430> better<00:00:32.640> way<00:00:32.880> like<00:00:33.180> when<00:00:33.300> we

00:00:33.410 --> 00:00:33.420 
when you see a better way like when we

00:00:33.420 --> 00:00:35.660 
when you see a better way like when we
overlay<00:00:33.930> from<00:00:34.350> driver<00:00:34.590> to<00:00:34.739> driver<00:00:34.950> oh<00:00:35.190> he's

00:00:35.660 --> 00:00:35.670 
overlay from driver to driver oh he's

00:00:35.670 --> 00:00:37.130 
overlay from driver to driver oh he's
breaking<00:00:36.030> later<00:00:36.210> oh<00:00:36.450> he's<00:00:36.750> on<00:00:36.780> the<00:00:36.960> throttle

00:00:37.130 --> 00:00:37.140 
breaking later oh he's on the throttle

00:00:37.140 --> 00:00:39.709 
breaking later oh he's on the throttle
sooner<00:00:37.620> it<00:00:37.770> can<00:00:38.040> be<00:00:38.280> done<00:00:38.520> it'll<00:00:39.120> elevate<00:00:39.600> the

00:00:39.709 --> 00:00:39.719 
sooner it can be done it'll elevate the

00:00:39.719 --> 00:00:41.630 
sooner it can be done it'll elevate the
driver<00:00:40.020> to<00:00:40.290> even<00:00:40.559> the<00:00:40.649> performance<00:00:41.160> of<00:00:41.280> what<00:00:41.489> a

00:00:41.630 --> 00:00:41.640 
driver to even the performance of what a

00:00:41.640 --> 00:00:44.119 
driver to even the performance of what a
BMW<00:00:42.420> is<00:00:42.480> capable<00:00:42.840> of<00:00:42.899> doing<00:00:43.200> just<00:00:43.770> another

00:00:44.119 --> 00:00:44.129 
BMW is capable of doing just another

00:00:44.129 --> 00:00:46.790 
BMW is capable of doing just another
thought<00:00:44.430> of<00:00:44.640> how<00:00:45.420> BMW<00:00:45.960> can<00:00:46.140> not<00:00:46.320> only<00:00:46.440> improve

00:00:46.790 --> 00:00:46.800 
thought of how BMW can not only improve

00:00:46.800 --> 00:00:48.950 
thought of how BMW can not only improve
their<00:00:46.950> cars<00:00:47.129> but<00:00:47.640> improve<00:00:48.210> the<00:00:48.420> spacer<00:00:48.809> that

00:00:48.950 --> 00:00:48.960 
their cars but improve the spacer that

00:00:48.960 --> 00:00:50.240 
their cars but improve the spacer that
behind<00:00:49.260> the<00:00:49.320> steering<00:00:49.500> wheel<00:00:49.649> like<00:00:49.920> what<00:00:50.129> we

00:00:50.240 --> 00:00:50.250 
behind the steering wheel like what we

00:00:50.250 --> 00:00:55.010 
behind the steering wheel like what we
do<00:00:51.829> what<00:00:52.829> we<00:00:52.980> did<00:00:53.250> was<00:00:53.550> we<00:00:53.699> built<00:00:54.059> a<00:00:54.360> fantastic

00:00:55.010 --> 00:00:55.020 
do what we did was we built a fantastic

00:00:55.020 --> 00:00:57.619 
do what we did was we built a fantastic
track<00:00:55.860> app<00:00:56.129> for<00:00:56.520> the<00:00:56.579> enthusiast<00:00:56.699> we<00:00:57.390> wanted

00:00:57.619 --> 00:00:57.629 
track app for the enthusiast we wanted

00:00:57.629 --> 00:00:59.060 
track app for the enthusiast we wanted
to<00:00:57.690> wanted<00:00:58.199> to<00:00:58.350> build<00:00:58.530> something<00:00:58.770> great<00:00:58.890> for

00:00:59.060 --> 00:00:59.070 
to wanted to build something great for

00:00:59.070 --> 00:01:01.639 
to wanted to build something great for
the<00:00:59.250> BMW<00:00:59.460> enthusiasts<00:01:00.270> and<00:01:00.960> what<00:01:01.109> we<00:01:01.199> did<00:01:01.350> was

00:01:01.639 --> 00:01:01.649 
the BMW enthusiasts and what we did was

00:01:01.649 --> 00:01:04.429 
the BMW enthusiasts and what we did was
we<00:01:01.879> we<00:01:02.879> wrote<00:01:03.120> an<00:01:03.239> iphone<00:01:03.600> application<00:01:04.290> that

00:01:04.429 --> 00:01:04.439 
we we wrote an iphone application that

00:01:04.439 --> 00:01:06.740 
we we wrote an iphone application that
communicates<00:01:04.949> with<00:01:05.129> the<00:01:05.189> car<00:01:05.519> and<00:01:05.750> it

00:01:06.740 --> 00:01:06.750 
communicates with the car and it

00:01:06.750 --> 00:01:09.590 
communicates with the car and it
downloads<00:01:07.140> all<00:01:07.590> the<00:01:07.799> data<00:01:08.240> from<00:01:09.240> the<00:01:09.390> car

00:01:09.590 --> 00:01:09.600 
downloads all the data from the car

00:01:24.980 --> 00:01:24.990 
you can look at this data you can look

00:01:24.990 --> 00:01:27.050 
you can look at this data you can look
at<00:01:25.110> your<00:01:25.229> run<00:01:25.409> on<00:01:25.560> the<00:01:25.680> track<00:01:25.920> in<00:01:26.250> great<00:01:26.580> detail

00:01:27.050 --> 00:01:27.060 
at your run on the track in great detail

00:01:27.060 --> 00:01:29.719 
at your run on the track in great detail
and<00:01:27.330> an<00:01:27.659> intuitive<00:01:28.170> way<00:01:28.350> to<00:01:28.950> understand<00:01:29.430> first

00:01:29.719 --> 00:01:29.729 
and an intuitive way to understand first

00:01:29.729 --> 00:01:31.580 
and an intuitive way to understand first
of<00:01:29.790> all<00:01:29.909> what<00:01:30.030> your<00:01:30.119> lap<00:01:30.270> times<00:01:30.600> were<00:01:30.750> but<00:01:31.500> then

00:01:31.580 --> 00:01:31.590 
of all what your lap times were but then

00:01:31.590 --> 00:01:33.380 
of all what your lap times were but then
secondly<00:01:32.009> exactly<00:01:32.549> what<00:01:32.729> you<00:01:32.850> did<00:01:33.030> in<00:01:33.210> turn

00:01:33.380 --> 00:01:33.390 
secondly exactly what you did in turn

00:01:33.390 --> 00:01:35.420 
secondly exactly what you did in turn
three<00:01:33.780> what<00:01:34.140> was<00:01:34.320> your<00:01:34.530> throttle<00:01:35.009> position

00:01:35.420 --> 00:01:35.430 
three what was your throttle position

00:01:35.430 --> 00:01:38.359 
three what was your throttle position
how<00:01:36.090> did<00:01:36.299> you<00:01:36.509> how<00:01:37.290> did<00:01:37.320> you<00:01:37.560> get<00:01:37.799> to<00:01:37.979> that<00:01:38.009> lap

00:01:38.359 --> 00:01:38.369 
how did you how did you get to that lap

00:01:38.369 --> 00:01:40.310 
how did you how did you get to that lap
time<00:01:38.640> and<00:01:38.880> they're<00:01:39.540> really<00:01:39.659> the<00:01:39.990> coolest

00:01:40.310 --> 00:01:40.320 
time and they're really the coolest

00:01:40.320 --> 00:01:43.760 
time and they're really the coolest
feature<00:01:40.530> i<00:01:40.680> think<00:01:41.009> is<00:01:41.509> you<00:01:42.509> can<00:01:42.720> compare<00:01:43.229> your

00:01:43.760 --> 00:01:43.770 
feature i think is you can compare your

00:01:43.770 --> 00:01:46.010 
feature i think is you can compare your
recording<00:01:44.430> with<00:01:44.759> your<00:01:44.970> instructors<00:01:45.540> or<00:01:45.840> maybe

00:01:46.010 --> 00:01:46.020 
recording with your instructors or maybe

00:01:46.020 --> 00:01:48.980 
recording with your instructors or maybe
a<00:01:46.110> friend<00:01:46.439> who<00:01:46.619> is<00:01:46.740> faster<00:01:47.340> so<00:01:48.299> you<00:01:48.360> take<00:01:48.750> both

00:01:48.980 --> 00:01:48.990 
a friend who is faster so you take both

00:01:48.990 --> 00:01:50.719 
a friend who is faster so you take both
recordings<00:01:49.619> you<00:01:49.740> email<00:01:50.100> them<00:01:50.220> to<00:01:50.369> each<00:01:50.490> other

00:01:50.719 --> 00:01:50.729 
recordings you email them to each other

00:01:50.729 --> 00:01:53.120 
recordings you email them to each other
you<00:01:51.180> open<00:01:51.450> them<00:01:51.540> both<00:01:51.689> up<00:01:51.930> in<00:01:52.079> the<00:01:52.170> app<00:01:52.290> and<00:01:52.560> you

00:01:53.120 --> 00:01:53.130 
you open them both up in the app and you

00:01:53.130 --> 00:01:55.880 
you open them both up in the app and you
can<00:01:53.159> actually<00:01:53.430> overlay<00:01:54.090> the<00:01:54.479> data<00:01:54.780> in<00:01:55.140> such<00:01:55.860> a

00:01:55.880 --> 00:01:55.890 
can actually overlay the data in such a

00:01:55.890 --> 00:01:58.850 
can actually overlay the data in such a
way<00:01:56.130> that<00:01:56.159> you<00:01:56.340> can<00:01:56.430> see<00:01:56.909> why<00:01:57.750> on<00:01:58.140> turn<00:01:58.439> three

00:01:58.850 --> 00:01:58.860 
way that you can see why on turn three

00:01:58.860 --> 00:02:01.010 
way that you can see why on turn three
was<00:01:59.310> one<00:01:59.549> driver<00:01:59.790> slower<00:02:00.180> than<00:02:00.390> the<00:02:00.509> other<00:02:00.689> one

00:02:01.010 --> 00:02:01.020 
was one driver slower than the other one

00:02:01.020 --> 00:02:03.469 
was one driver slower than the other one
one<00:02:01.380> driver<00:02:01.590> for<00:02:01.890> example<00:02:02.280> came<00:02:02.939> in<00:02:03.119> slower

00:02:03.469 --> 00:02:03.479 
one driver for example came in slower

00:02:03.479 --> 00:02:05.899 
one driver for example came in slower
and<00:02:03.780> and<00:02:04.770> was<00:02:04.979> able<00:02:05.100> to<00:02:05.219> accelerate<00:02:05.549> through

00:02:05.899 --> 00:02:05.909 
and and was able to accelerate through

00:02:05.909 --> 00:02:07.490 
and and was able to accelerate through
the<00:02:06.119> turn<00:02:06.360> better<00:02:06.750> getting<00:02:07.049> on<00:02:07.170> the<00:02:07.320> throttle

00:02:07.490 --> 00:02:07.500 
the turn better getting on the throttle

00:02:07.500 --> 00:02:08.330 
the turn better getting on the throttle
earlier

00:02:08.330 --> 00:02:08.340 
earlier

00:02:08.340 --> 00:02:09.830 
earlier
which<00:02:08.580> paid<00:02:08.879> dividends<00:02:09.330> over<00:02:09.450> the<00:02:09.690> long

00:02:09.830 --> 00:02:09.840 
which paid dividends over the long

00:02:09.840 --> 00:02:12.140 
which paid dividends over the long
straight<00:02:10.310> resulting<00:02:11.310> in<00:02:11.400> a<00:02:11.459> better<00:02:11.610> lap<00:02:11.849> time

00:02:12.140 --> 00:02:12.150 
straight resulting in a better lap time

00:02:12.150 --> 00:02:13.850 
straight resulting in a better lap time
and<00:02:12.390> so<00:02:12.959> you<00:02:13.019> can<00:02:13.140> really<00:02:13.290> get<00:02:13.500> into<00:02:13.739> these

00:02:13.850 --> 00:02:13.860 
and so you can really get into these
