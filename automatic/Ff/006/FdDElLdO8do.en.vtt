00:00:09.310 --> 00:00:13.570
 and hello everyone knows where you and 

00:00:11.680 --> 00:00:15.640
 we are today on diablo iii 

00:00:13.570 --> 00:00:16.209
 for a little trick to close some 

00:00:15.640 --> 00:00:18.010
 legendary 

00:00:16.209 --> 00:00:20.470
 so I warn you here's ahead 

00:00:18.010 --> 00:00:22.540
 it has absolutely nothing glorious seniors 

00:00:20.470 --> 00:00:23.950
 interestingly it's a farmin who 

00:00:22.540 --> 00:00:26.500
 is really boring and boring 

00:00:23.950 --> 00:00:27.970
 personally i hate but to but 

00:00:26.500 --> 00:00:29.500
 good at times it can help out 

00:00:27.970 --> 00:00:31.720
 when we need a fast legendary 

00:00:29.500 --> 00:00:34.450
 for to make a soul forget by 

00:00:31.720 --> 00:00:36.850
 example to enchant one of our weapons 

00:00:34.450 --> 00:00:38.739
 or something in that style so 

00:00:36.850 --> 00:00:40.930
 me what's going on and that's it I wanted 

00:00:38.739 --> 00:00:42.430
 just the little ips we'll say because 

00:00:40.930 --> 00:00:43.450
 that there are people that does not pose 

00:00:42.430 --> 00:00:45.460
 problem there are people who appreciate 

00:00:43.450 --> 00:00:45.880
 that kind of stuff so it's like that 

00:00:45.460 --> 00:00:47.410
 that it happens 

00:00:45.880 --> 00:00:49.660
 we go into parameters two parts have 

00:00:47.410 --> 00:00:52.000
 chosen campaign and chose act 3 the 

00:00:49.660 --> 00:00:55.060
 last quest killed at this mode year a 

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:57.460
 little bit do you know remember the 

00:00:55.060 --> 00:00:59.530
 kaiser fox we had this tp have 

00:00:57.460 --> 00:01:00.460
 started at the level of modane and 

00:00:59.530 --> 00:01:03.250
 was doing the opposite 

00:01:00.460 --> 00:01:04.930
 there we are on the same base up and we 

00:01:03.250 --> 00:01:06.970
 click on play then I have them 

00:01:04.930 --> 00:01:08.470
 already done so I already have the portal but 

00:01:06.970 --> 00:01:10.119
 in fact if you want the purpose of the game 

00:01:08.470 --> 00:01:12.130
 it's really as soon as you start 

00:01:10.119 --> 00:01:14.579
 you choose the right kate and you 

00:01:12.130 --> 00:01:16.420
 take the tp for the stop heart at 

00:01:14.579 --> 00:01:17.979
 once in the heart of Ariane 

00:01:16.420 --> 00:01:20.439
 the goal of the game is to go from 

00:01:17.979 --> 00:01:21.909
 cross it all the way through and a 

00:01:20.439 --> 00:01:22.630
 Once you are at the end you will 

00:01:21.909 --> 00:01:23.950
 a backup weight 

00:01:22.630 --> 00:01:26.109
 so there's you to see either you 

00:01:23.950 --> 00:01:29.619
 get into the fight this modane and then 

00:01:26.109 --> 00:01:31.359
 you make a cope leave either you 

00:01:29.619 --> 00:01:33.039
 you leave just before the door 

00:01:31.359 --> 00:01:35.259
 you to see and in fact what will happen 

00:01:33.039 --> 00:01:37.899
 pass is that you will have the tp that goes 

00:01:35.259 --> 00:01:39.369
 take you right here so at the end of 

00:01:37.899 --> 00:01:41.560
 crater stop at and the goal actually 

00:01:39.369 --> 00:01:44.439
 it's all gone in the opposite direction 

00:01:41.560 --> 00:01:47.530
 and open all the chests 

00:01:44.439 --> 00:01:49.539
 it's a run safe here and in his 

00:01:47.530 --> 00:01:50.950
 chests there are still a lot of 

00:01:49.539 --> 00:01:52.240
 legendary look nothing 

00:01:50.950 --> 00:01:54.219
 is already an hour and a half 

00:01:52.240 --> 00:01:56.889
 I do it and I had it all a gift 

00:01:54.219 --> 00:01:58.649
 a beautiful cuirass of the king is mortal 

00:01:56.889 --> 00:02:00.700
 it seems to me that it is likely to be pretty bad 

00:01:58.649 --> 00:02:02.229
 it's nice 

00:02:00.700 --> 00:02:03.880
 I personally find that in 

00:02:02.229 --> 00:02:06.039
 reaper of south they did very good 

00:02:03.880 --> 00:02:08.619
 work with the bounty zh mode 

00:02:06.039 --> 00:02:11.050
 adventure here are the flaws and so it's 

00:02:08.619 --> 00:02:12.580
 it annoys me a little bit to do this run 

00:02:11.050 --> 00:02:13.840
 but as I tell you once from 

00:02:12.580 --> 00:02:16.240
 from time to time it can always 

00:02:13.840 --> 00:02:17.409
 to be cool after there are no exploits 

00:02:16.240 --> 00:02:18.940
 in the are often there just 

00:02:17.409 --> 00:02:21.370
 run and open chests 

00:02:18.940 --> 00:02:23.320
 we do not break we do not use any 

00:02:21.370 --> 00:02:23.740
 break game mechanics if it can you 

00:02:23.320 --> 00:02:26.200
 reassure 

00:02:23.740 --> 00:02:28.360
 so that's what happens is that me 

00:02:26.200 --> 00:02:30.160
 in fact I opted for robustness 

00:02:28.360 --> 00:02:32.320
 because we're still wrong 26 a 

00:02:30.160 --> 00:02:34.360
 frozen not specified for it to be 

00:02:32.320 --> 00:02:36.310
 interesting you have to do this run in 

00:02:34.360 --> 00:02:38.050
 twisting this of course to open the 

00:02:36.310 --> 00:02:38.890
 chests and have more chances to have 

00:02:38.050 --> 00:02:40.210
 a legendary 

00:02:38.890 --> 00:02:42.040
 and then if you have the same mfc 

00:02:40.210 --> 00:02:45.070
 old me I have this helmet hanging out 

00:02:42.040 --> 00:02:45.400
 in business of benjamines djm 39 m 

00:02:45.070 --> 00:02:47.440
 f 

00:02:45.400 --> 00:02:49.030
 even if it's not amazing it's 

00:02:47.440 --> 00:02:50.320
 still it's taken and then here I have 

00:02:49.030 --> 00:02:53.710
 tried to climb a little bit the review 

00:02:50.320 --> 00:02:54.100
 dropped 1.11 million with the good debts 

00:02:53.710 --> 00:02:55.750
 etc. 

00:02:54.100 --> 00:02:57.220
 I could have gone up to 17 million 

00:02:55.750 --> 00:02:59.530
 do not brush it's not necessarily useful 

00:02:57.220 --> 00:03:01.420
 so it's up to you to adapt according to your class 

00:02:59.530 --> 00:03:04.230
 I know that wizards can do 

00:03:01.420 --> 00:03:07.390
 this run without problems thanks to tp etc 

00:03:04.230 --> 00:03:09.100
 fetishist too can dh by cons I 

00:03:07.390 --> 00:03:10.510
 can not you tell me in my opinion that 

00:03:09.100 --> 00:03:11.770
 should finally go good I think that 

00:03:10.510 --> 00:03:12.430
 it's a young person who can be made by 

00:03:11.770 --> 00:03:14.680
 everybody 

00:03:12.430 --> 00:03:16.150
 that's it now that it's done 

00:03:14.680 --> 00:03:17.710
 me if you want I'm barbarian so 

00:03:16.150 --> 00:03:19.750
 I saw this is what he has it to generate 

00:03:17.710 --> 00:03:21.550
 of fury to be able to sprint to 

00:03:19.750 --> 00:03:23.350
 marathon shots I even put to 

00:03:21.550 --> 00:03:25.239
 buckle this is one of the only times where 

00:03:23.350 --> 00:03:26.650
 you will see me with shields so 

00:03:25.239 --> 00:03:28.720
 there you can crush a little bit all 

00:03:26.650 --> 00:03:31.150
 these scenery see as soon as there are elites 

00:03:28.720 --> 00:03:32.680
 course is broken the receptacle it 

00:03:31.150 --> 00:03:34.300
 must open it immediately it's this 

00:03:32.680 --> 00:03:35.050
 we are aiming for everything is small 

00:03:34.300 --> 00:03:37.270
 receptacle 

00:03:35.050 --> 00:03:38.590
 so you see it hurts 

00:03:37.270 --> 00:03:40.420
 it hurts 

00:03:38.590 --> 00:03:43.209
 so you have to be able to cash in when 

00:03:40.420 --> 00:03:44.170
 even a few blows here I'm breaking it 

00:03:43.209 --> 00:03:44.830
 are elites who can make us 

00:03:44.170 --> 00:03:46.570
 very very badly 

00:03:44.830 --> 00:03:48.340
 so in fact the goal is really 

00:03:46.570 --> 00:03:50.050
 cross and open only the 

00:03:48.340 --> 00:03:52.480
 receptacles so when I told you 

00:03:50.050 --> 00:03:52.840
 that it was all rotten you have it 

00:03:52.480 --> 00:03:54.970
 evidence 

00:03:52.840 --> 00:03:58.209
 and once we are here we have the choice 

00:03:54.970 --> 00:04:00.880
 either we go to tp we take it for 

00:03:58.209 --> 00:04:02.290
 enter the city and decorate the advantage 

00:04:00.880 --> 00:04:04.750
 know it's going to give us time to 

00:04:02.290 --> 00:04:07.360
 look on the map if there is not a 

00:04:04.750 --> 00:04:09.250
 pretty little star so a legendary 

00:04:07.360 --> 00:04:11.320
 and once we get to that point 

00:04:09.250 --> 00:04:14.320
 we do we leave the game and 

00:04:11.320 --> 00:04:16.299
 immediately we start again behind 

00:04:14.320 --> 00:04:17.739
 you still see it aaron who is 

00:04:16.299 --> 00:04:19.900
 do it fast enough if you have a small 

00:04:17.739 --> 00:04:21.820
 until a series beat her on your 

00:04:19.900 --> 00:04:23.080
 screen right or a stream and ben you 

00:04:21.820 --> 00:04:24.160
 can a little bit off your 

00:04:23.080 --> 00:04:25.930
 brain and do that a little 

00:04:24.160 --> 00:04:27.230
 half an hour an hour it can always 

00:04:25.930 --> 00:04:29.030
 be profitable to 

00:04:27.230 --> 00:04:30.230
 see me then I do not have enough rage I 

00:04:29.030 --> 00:04:32.690
 do my war ass that I seem to be 

00:04:30.230 --> 00:04:34.550
 that generates 50 of rage that's what I do 

00:04:32.690 --> 00:04:36.260
 my valence which generates 30 and I 

00:04:34.550 --> 00:04:37.880
 enough gas to sprint 

00:04:36.260 --> 00:04:40.550
 until the end so it's really 

00:04:37.880 --> 00:04:41.990
 benefit him and then yeah of course he 

00:04:40.550 --> 00:04:44.570
 there are a lot of things that I 

00:04:41.990 --> 00:04:46.940
 spoke to further improve speed 

00:04:44.570 --> 00:04:48.770
 traveling when I get them 

00:04:46.940 --> 00:04:51.530
 risk of being interesting and I do not have 

00:04:48.770 --> 00:04:54.170
 opened the receptacle is the drama that 

00:04:51.530 --> 00:04:55.310
 is going to happen it's ok ok there I'm 

00:04:54.170 --> 00:04:57.290
 short request or even history of 

00:04:55.310 --> 00:04:59.180
 to be able to cash a little more run 

00:04:57.290 --> 00:05:00.800
 faster is that this wrath is very 

00:04:59.180 --> 00:05:03.350
 useful for those who do this run in 

00:05:00.800 --> 00:05:04.670
 barbaric and there good unfortunately I 

00:05:03.350 --> 00:05:07.550
 did not have to have two legendary ones because 

00:05:04.670 --> 00:05:08.930
 that it's not necessary to mess up but the 

00:05:07.550 --> 00:05:11.900
 small ips to go even faster 

00:05:08.930 --> 00:05:13.580
 it is to die near this fire sent on 

00:05:11.900 --> 00:05:15.260
 fire hurts excessively in addition to 

00:05:13.580 --> 00:05:18.320
 enemies you are dead what you 

00:05:15.260 --> 00:05:19.640
 can do it is resurrected in the city 

00:05:18.320 --> 00:05:21.170
 now I do not advise you to 

00:05:19.640 --> 00:05:23.210
 to make the best of it is that I have 

00:05:21.170 --> 00:05:26.450
 shoulders is two to kara that make 

00:05:23.210 --> 00:05:28.190
 all my indestructible objects so from 

00:05:26.450 --> 00:05:29.600
 suddenly there is no problem I will pay 

00:05:28.190 --> 00:05:31.970
 no repairs so I can afford 

00:05:29.600 --> 00:05:34.730
 to die in the fire for free 

00:05:31.970 --> 00:05:36.260
 so it's still not to take on 

00:05:34.730 --> 00:05:37.790
 makes a last little fox story 

00:05:36.260 --> 00:05:39.560
 that here you are estimating the 

00:05:37.790 --> 00:05:41.570
 thing and why not grab a little 

00:05:39.560 --> 00:05:44.360
 legendary it could be nice 

00:05:41.570 --> 00:05:45.770
 go we left me dreaming 

00:05:44.360 --> 00:05:47.390
 to have the golden head fury frozen in 

00:05:45.770 --> 00:05:49.880
 double I loved bet on my father 

00:05:47.390 --> 00:05:51.500
 what is it to say to you I did not have 

00:05:49.880 --> 00:05:53.000
 here there fuss this is just a 

00:05:51.500 --> 00:05:54.830
 little thing that I tell you in passing 

00:05:53.000 --> 00:05:57.050
 so very very happy anyway 

00:05:54.830 --> 00:05:59.360
 she is not better then on my father 

00:05:57.050 --> 00:06:01.010
 she is perfect that's where will 

00:05:59.360 --> 00:06:03.200
 surely crossed why not we'll see 

00:06:01.010 --> 00:06:04.940
 much later go on we open all 

00:06:03.200 --> 00:06:06.590
 chests we have nothing we do not have time 

00:06:04.940 --> 00:06:08.510
 to serious in his eyes as you see there 

00:06:06.590 --> 00:06:10.730
 we do not have time to pick up the 

00:06:08.510 --> 00:06:12.710
 diamonds the gems and company because 

00:06:10.730 --> 00:06:15.770
 only because otherwise it's death 

00:06:12.710 --> 00:06:17.420
 assured we are still in t6 we open 

00:06:15.770 --> 00:06:20.210
 there is nothing and ben we put ourselves in front of the 

00:06:17.420 --> 00:06:22.640
 fire and we die gently so that's it 

00:06:20.210 --> 00:06:25.250
 for the little ips to you to see if you 

00:06:22.640 --> 00:06:27.260
 want to use it or not that's 

00:06:25.250 --> 00:06:29.030
 it's up to you to manage me 

00:06:27.260 --> 00:06:31.010
 just the info for those who do not 

00:06:29.030 --> 00:06:32.060
 would not know yet gone on this I 

00:06:31.010 --> 00:06:33.110
 wish you a good end of the day 

00:06:32.060 --> 00:06:35.710
 and see you 

00:06:33.110 --> 00:06:35.710
 ciao
