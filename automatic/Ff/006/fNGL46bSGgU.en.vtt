00:00:55.610 --> 00:01:00.870
 I've still changed 

00:00:57.540 --> 00:01:03.420
 Recently, such things have been stagnant and such products 

00:01:00.870 --> 00:01:07.380
 Replacement Idei Toka or try to change the position

00:01:16.530 --> 00:01:22.500
 so 

00:01:17.189 --> 00:01:23.440
 It was about 100 meals in one month originally placed in the lower part of the sample case 

00:01:22.500 --> 00:01:26.900
 300 places 

00:01:23.440 --> 00:01:28.020

00:01:46.680 --> 00:01:57.480
 re place 

00:01:51.870 --> 00:02:00.690
 If it is used like this, scrap estimate is 100,000 yen to 200,000 yen 1 

00:01:57.480 --> 00:02:04.310
 It is thought that it is a loss in the shop per month 

00:02:00.690 --> 00:02:08.270
