intensity<00:00:37.500> okay<00:00:40.280> if<00:00:41.280> we<00:00:41.460> blow<00:00:41.730> this<00:00:42.390> way<00:00:42.629> we

00:00:43.130 --> 00:00:43.140 
intensity okay if we blow this way we

00:00:43.140 --> 00:00:53.420 
intensity okay if we blow this way we
can<00:00:43.350> create<00:00:43.559> some<00:00:44.450> glass<00:00:45.710> effects<00:00:52.430> sometimes

00:00:53.420 --> 00:00:53.430 
can create some glass effects sometimes

00:00:53.430 --> 00:00:55.880 
can create some glass effects sometimes
the<00:00:53.760> effect<00:00:54.059> is<00:00:54.180> not<00:00:54.300> the<00:00:54.629> perfect<00:00:55.020> so<00:00:55.680> you<00:00:55.770> can

00:00:55.880 --> 00:00:55.890 
the effect is not the perfect so you can

00:00:55.890 --> 00:01:00.319 
the effect is not the perfect so you can
use<00:00:56.039> a<00:00:56.070> finger<00:00:56.960> fingernails<00:00:58.969> to<00:00:59.969> pay<00:01:00.120> more

00:01:00.319 --> 00:01:00.329 
use a finger fingernails to pay more

00:01:00.329 --> 00:01:06.670 
use a finger fingernails to pay more
glasses<00:01:04.610> by<00:01:05.610> the<00:01:05.670> way<00:01:05.850> glass<00:01:06.119> is<00:01:06.299> not<00:01:06.420> always

00:01:06.670 --> 00:01:06.680 
glasses by the way glass is not always

00:01:06.680 --> 00:01:11.080 
glasses by the way glass is not always
clean<00:01:07.939> so<00:01:08.939> it<00:01:09.510> can<00:01:09.840> have<00:01:10.020> different<00:01:10.409> colors

00:01:11.080 --> 00:01:11.090 
clean so it can have different colors

00:01:11.090 --> 00:01:15.760 
clean so it can have different colors
okay

00:01:15.760 --> 00:01:15.770

00:01:24.710 --> 00:01:24.720 
this point you can let's say this area

00:01:24.720 --> 00:01:27.620 
this point you can let's say this area
we<00:01:25.049> can<00:01:25.080> you're<00:01:25.470> going<00:01:25.590> to<00:01:25.650> paint<00:01:25.770> a<00:01:25.860> rock<00:01:26.630> or

we can you're going to paint a rock or
dirt<00:01:29.720> if<00:01:30.720> we<00:01:30.930> use<00:01:31.140> a<00:01:31.170> brush<00:01:32.000> you<00:01:33.000> can<00:01:33.180> create

00:01:33.410 --> 00:01:33.420 
dirt if we use a brush you can create

00:01:33.420 --> 00:01:41.300 
dirt if we use a brush you can create
some<00:01:33.770> hard<00:01:34.770> edges<00:01:35.750> most<00:01:36.750> likely<00:01:39.650> see<00:01:40.650> hot

00:01:41.300 --> 00:01:41.310 
some hard edges most likely see hot

00:01:41.310 --> 00:01:45.230 
some hard edges most likely see hot
edges<00:01:42.320> if<00:01:43.320> you<00:01:43.770> don't<00:01:43.950> want<00:01:44.070> to<00:01:44.159> create<00:01:44.280> clear

00:01:45.230 --> 00:01:45.240 
edges if you don't want to create clear

00:01:45.240 --> 00:01:48.670 
edges if you don't want to create clear
hot<00:01:45.420> edges<00:01:45.780> you<00:01:46.470> can<00:01:46.500> use<00:01:46.770> your<00:01:46.920> finger<00:01:47.280> to

00:01:48.670 --> 00:01:48.680 
hot edges you can use your finger to

00:01:48.680 --> 00:01:54.530 
hot edges you can use your finger to
soft<00:01:50.750> one<00:01:51.750> of<00:01:51.899> the<00:01:52.020> edge<00:01:52.560> so<00:01:53.399> it<00:01:53.520> become<00:01:53.909> much

00:01:54.530 --> 00:01:54.540 
soft one of the edge so it become much

00:01:54.540 --> 00:01:58.440 
soft one of the edge so it become much
softer

00:01:58.440 --> 00:01:58.450 

00:01:58.450 --> 00:02:02.410 

see<00:01:59.450> again<00:01:59.930> hard<00:02:00.229> edges<00:02:00.969> this<00:02:01.969> looks<00:02:02.240> like<00:02:02.360> a

00:02:02.410 --> 00:02:02.420 
see again hard edges this looks like a

00:02:02.420 --> 00:02:17.059 
see again hard edges this looks like a
rock<00:02:04.689> okay

00:02:17.059 --> 00:02:17.069 

00:02:17.069 --> 00:02:23.490 

and<00:02:18.069> in<00:02:18.340> one<00:02:18.489> side<00:02:18.790> of<00:02:19.000> the<00:02:19.239> block<00:02:20.110> here<00:02:22.500> you

00:02:23.490 --> 00:02:23.500 
and in one side of the block here you

00:02:23.500 --> 00:02:27.119 
and in one side of the block here you
don't<00:02:23.650> want<00:02:23.860> it<00:02:24.629> hard<00:02:25.629> edges<00:02:25.780> on<00:02:26.019> this<00:02:26.200> side<00:02:26.440> so

00:02:27.119 --> 00:02:27.129 
don't want it hard edges on this side so

00:02:27.129 --> 00:02:33.050 
don't want it hard edges on this side so
you<00:02:27.159> use<00:02:27.400> your<00:02:27.549> finger<00:02:31.590> okay<00:02:32.590> fine

00:02:48.440 --> 00:02:48.450 
first you get the leaf area with water

00:02:48.450 --> 00:02:52.470 
first you get the leaf area with water
my<00:02:49.450> brush<00:02:49.660> has<00:02:49.840> a<00:02:49.870> little<00:02:50.579> color<00:02:51.579> on<00:02:51.790> it<00:02:51.910> it's
