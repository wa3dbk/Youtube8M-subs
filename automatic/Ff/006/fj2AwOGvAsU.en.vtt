hey guys I thought I just give you an
update<00:00:04.859> here<00:00:05.130> with<00:00:05.279> a<00:00:05.310> video<00:00:05.640> rather<00:00:05.850> than

00:00:06.110 --> 00:00:06.120 
update here with a video rather than

00:00:06.120 --> 00:00:07.870 
update here with a video rather than
type<00:00:06.330> everything<00:00:06.750> up<00:00:06.960> makes<00:00:07.440> a<00:00:07.529> little<00:00:07.680> easier

00:00:07.870 --> 00:00:07.880 
type everything up makes a little easier

00:00:07.880 --> 00:00:14.810 
type everything up makes a little easier
so<00:00:09.170> there<00:00:10.170> we<00:00:10.230> go<00:00:10.260> that<00:00:12.320> is<00:00:13.460> the<00:00:14.460> alcohol

00:00:14.810 --> 00:00:14.820 
so there we go that is the alcohol

00:00:14.820 --> 00:00:17.150 
so there we go that is the alcohol

00:00:47.090 --> 00:00:47.100 
but it'll be off below 15 psi I'm gonna

00:00:47.100 --> 00:00:49.790 
but it'll be off below 15 psi I'm gonna
make<00:00:47.250> a<00:00:47.280> tank<00:00:47.579> and<00:00:47.850> I'm<00:00:47.940> gonna<00:00:48.059> melt<00:00:48.270> it<00:00:48.800> right

00:00:49.790 --> 00:00:49.800 
make a tank and I'm gonna melt it right

00:00:49.800 --> 00:00:52.880

00:02:42.459 --> 00:02:46.140 
injection nozzle right there those spray
in<00:02:42.640> on<00:02:42.820> the<00:02:43.830> hot<00:02:44.830> side<00:02:45.130> I<00:02:45.190> guess<00:02:45.610> to<00:02:45.730> the<00:02:45.760> intake

00:02:46.140 --> 00:02:46.150 
in on the hot side I guess to the intake

00:02:46.150 --> 00:02:48.870 
in on the hot side I guess to the intake
form<00:02:46.480> up<00:02:46.570> to<00:02:46.720> the<00:02:46.810> intercooler<00:02:47.110> because<00:02:47.709> a<00:02:47.880> hot

00:02:48.870 --> 00:02:48.880 
form up to the intercooler because a hot

00:02:48.880 --> 00:02:54.500 
form up to the intercooler because a hot
air<00:02:49.090> will<00:02:49.269> actually<00:02:50.100> help<00:02:51.100> the<00:02:51.989> alcohol<00:02:53.280> spray

00:02:54.500 --> 00:02:54.510 
air will actually help the alcohol spray

00:02:54.510 --> 00:02:57.600 
air will actually help the alcohol spray
atomized<00:02:55.510> fully<00:02:55.870> so<00:02:56.080> it's<00:02:56.230> better<00:02:56.610> utilized

00:02:57.600 --> 00:02:57.610 
atomized fully so it's better utilized

00:02:57.610 --> 00:03:03.090 
atomized fully so it's better utilized
by<00:02:57.760> the<00:02:57.820> engine<00:02:58.200> that<00:02:59.200> way<00:03:01.800> basically<00:03:02.800> all<00:03:02.980> the

00:03:03.090 --> 00:03:03.100 
by the engine that way basically all the

00:03:03.100 --> 00:03:05.759 
by the engine that way basically all the
alcohol<00:03:03.519> does<00:03:04.300> is<00:03:04.630> when<00:03:04.900> when<00:03:05.440> it's<00:03:05.590> sprayed

00:03:05.759 --> 00:03:05.769 
alcohol does is when when it's sprayed

00:03:05.769 --> 00:03:09.090 
alcohol does is when when it's sprayed
in<00:03:05.950> the<00:03:05.980> intake<00:03:06.400> it's<00:03:07.380> number<00:03:08.380> one<00:03:08.560> it's<00:03:09.010> very

00:03:09.090 --> 00:03:09.100 
in the intake it's number one it's very

00:03:09.100 --> 00:03:13.259 
in the intake it's number one it's very
cold<00:03:09.750> so<00:03:10.750> I<00:03:10.780> hope<00:03:10.959> school<00:03:11.200> well<00:03:11.350> mint<00:03:12.060> in<00:03:13.060> take

00:03:13.259 --> 00:03:13.269 
cold so I hope school well mint in take

00:03:13.269 --> 00:03:16.500 
cold so I hope school well mint in take
charge<00:03:13.540> and<00:03:14.470> helps<00:03:15.370> the<00:03:15.459> intercooler<00:03:15.700> out<00:03:15.970> and

00:03:16.500 --> 00:03:16.510 
charge and helps the intercooler out and

00:03:16.510 --> 00:03:18.690 
charge and helps the intercooler out and
then<00:03:16.600> it<00:03:16.720> also<00:03:16.870> it<00:03:17.709> burns<00:03:17.950> cooler<00:03:18.370> once<00:03:18.549> it's

00:03:18.690 --> 00:03:18.700 
then it also it burns cooler once it's

00:03:18.700 --> 00:03:21.390 
then it also it burns cooler once it's
inside<00:03:18.970> the<00:03:19.180> combustion<00:03:19.810> chamber<00:03:20.290> so<00:03:21.160> it<00:03:21.280> was

00:03:21.390 --> 00:03:21.400 
inside the combustion chamber so it was

00:03:21.400 --> 00:03:23.220 
inside the combustion chamber so it was
kind<00:03:21.579> of<00:03:21.610> like<00:03:21.700> it<00:03:22.420> basically<00:03:22.720> raises<00:03:23.110> your

00:03:23.220 --> 00:03:23.230 
kind of like it basically raises your

00:03:23.230 --> 00:03:28.530 
kind of like it basically raises your
octane<00:03:23.799> rating<00:03:24.130> of<00:03:26.280> pump<00:03:27.280> gas<00:03:27.489> to<00:03:27.790> like<00:03:28.239> I've

00:03:28.530 --> 00:03:28.540 
octane rating of pump gas to like I've

00:03:28.540 --> 00:03:31.770 
octane rating of pump gas to like I've
heard<00:03:28.690> about<00:03:28.840> 115<00:03:29.500> to<00:03:29.590> 120<00:03:30.160> really<00:03:30.489> high<00:03:30.780> and

00:03:31.770 --> 00:03:31.780 
heard about 115 to 120 really high and

00:03:31.780 --> 00:03:33.569 
heard about 115 to 120 really high and
run<00:03:31.989> tons<00:03:32.440> of<00:03:32.560> boost<00:03:32.709> with<00:03:32.860> his<00:03:32.980> stuff<00:03:33.190> on<00:03:33.340> pump

00:03:33.569 --> 00:03:33.579 
run tons of boost with his stuff on pump

00:03:33.579 --> 00:03:38.580 
run tons of boost with his stuff on pump
gas<00:03:35.730> look<00:03:36.730> out<00:03:36.880> also<00:03:37.660> made<00:03:37.930> a<00:03:37.959> three<00:03:38.410> inch

00:03:38.580 --> 00:03:38.590 
gas look out also made a three inch

00:03:38.590 --> 00:03:42.509 
gas look out also made a three inch
exhaust<00:03:38.980> outlet<00:03:39.959> too<00:03:41.070> so<00:03:42.070> I<00:03:42.100> won't<00:03:42.280> have<00:03:42.370> to

00:03:42.509 --> 00:03:42.519 
exhaust outlet too so I won't have to

00:03:42.519 --> 00:03:44.580 
exhaust outlet too so I won't have to

00:03:50.350 --> 00:03:55.020 
turbo on back that's pretty much it we
should<00:03:50.530> have<00:03:50.650> a<00:03:50.709> run<00:03:50.950> in<00:03:52.799> late<00:03:53.799> March<00:03:54.100> or<00:03:54.400> early

00:03:55.020 --> 00:03:55.030 
should have a run in late March or early
