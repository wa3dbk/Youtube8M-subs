 Hello everyone, I'm here to help. 

00:00:19.970 --> 00:00:21.630
 My Photo 

00:00:21.630 --> 00:00:22.710
 in Switzerland

00:00:24.269 --> 00:00:27.439
 how was this fight that there is no need to foment the scene 

00:00:27.439 --> 00:00:30.439
 the most difficult confrontation to get employment commented that the performance 

00:00:31.369 --> 00:00:34.660
 also actually did not go any further 

00:00:34.660 --> 00:00:35.530
 Why not? 

00:00:35.530 --> 00:00:38.090
 they were all well prepared then 

00:00:38.090 --> 00:00:40.270
 lucas went to the goal 

00:00:40.270 --> 00:00:44.490
 they are actually being quite annoying occurrence 

00:00:45.690 --> 00:00:48.710
 had some kind of special training with enough ground scythes 

00:00:48.710 --> 00:00:52.950
 irregular movement then ended in a tie over the validity of the decision 

00:00:53.860 --> 00:00:57.530
 after she cared a bit more about my movement because 

00:00:57.530 --> 00:01:00.630
 the girls will be a bit lighter some of them 

00:01:00.630 --> 00:01:04.160
 this year unfortunately within the categories up to 65 to 70 

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:08.520
 the problem is with girls lighter than I worried about this group 

00:01:10.410 --> 00:01:12.120
 and went on top of this I worked 

00:01:12.120 --> 00:01:15.190
 using now what are your plans after winning here in abc 

00:01:15.190 --> 00:01:19.300
 as here you prepare now can be in the united states as you are 

00:01:19.300 --> 00:01:21.750
 seeing this opportunity to participate with abu dhabi 

00:01:21.750 --> 00:01:24.750
 nothing but changed your mind and Olympic sport 

00:01:26.200 --> 00:01:28.640
 to mcgraw-hill cos too long 

00:01:28.640 --> 00:01:30.500
 learn about the progress 

00:01:30.500 --> 00:01:35.090
 the traffic was another Olympic cycle for 2012 this event attracted 

00:01:35.090 --> 00:01:39.640
 a precedent why in any place I have practiced and that serves 

00:01:39.640 --> 00:01:43.030
 I got a nice big chunk with the little girl last month and 

00:01:43.030 --> 00:01:44.380
 since 2002 

00:01:44.380 --> 00:01:47.310
 because really I without sponsorship worse than 

00:01:47.310 --> 00:01:49.340
 You're a sponsor of china now. 

00:01:49.340 --> 00:01:50.960
 but it allows at this moment 

00:01:50.960 --> 00:01:53.960
 but we have a number of recent attacks the Chinese demand decision 

00:01:54.630 --> 00:01:57.560
 we were not helping with the Brazilian athletes 

00:01:57.560 --> 00:02:01.090
 for sponsors, you already have some that you would like to thank 

00:02:01.090 --> 00:02:02.790
 chairman for this participation 

00:02:02.790 --> 00:02:04.930
 12 years 

00:02:04.930 --> 00:02:08.840
 what always supports me option friends have to see this is my technical tire 

00:02:08.840 --> 00:02:13.350
 that's his son that our modest village is new goal is to keep me in a derby 

00:02:13.350 --> 00:02:17.770
 is a transgenic in the Senate always and is karine the formula that is the place that 

00:02:17.770 --> 00:02:19.009
 meets in sao paulo 

00:02:19.009 --> 00:02:22.009
 this piece that beat me by supporting me 

00:02:27.069 --> 00:02:28.339
 It is certain that the salt 

00:02:28.339 --> 00:02:33.059
 This was either the concession to direct chana drop of 69 requests for 

00:02:33.059 --> 00:02:33.889
 remaining audiences
