00:00:00.019 --> 00:00:03.620
 Welcome to this little interactive exercise 

00:00:03.620 --> 00:00:07.080
 8 just remember everything about my book 

00:00:07.080 --> 00:00:11.320
 My name is report and I will pass it through this Merck experiment 

00:00:11.320 --> 00:00:12.809
 accompany 

00:00:12.809 --> 00:00:14.379
 in the next minutes 

00:00:14.379 --> 00:00:16.869
 they will experience on their own heads 

00:00:16.869 --> 00:00:19.230
 how much her brain can remember 

00:00:19.230 --> 00:00:22.489
 and they will get 50 information 

00:00:22.489 --> 00:00:27.569
 in this case 50 photos entries and error-free keep in mind 

00:00:28.759 --> 00:00:33.999
 I will show you a total of 50 photos in the first part of the experiment 

00:00:34.930 --> 00:00:37.990
 each only for a few seconds 

00:00:37.990 --> 00:00:39.880
 and what they have to do 

00:00:39.880 --> 00:00:41.900
 just look closely 

00:00:41.900 --> 00:00:44.420
 look at the pictures in peace 

00:00:44.420 --> 00:00:47.510
 it's not that they should remember the photos 

00:00:48.020 --> 00:00:51.010
 Just give her the opportunity to belong 

00:00:51.010 --> 00:00:53.850
 to look at each of the pictures in a concentrated way 

00:00:53.850 --> 00:00:57.130
 and capture as much detail as possible 

00:00:57.130 --> 00:00:58.520
 are you ready to go? 

00:00:58.520 --> 00:01:01.980
 Then make yourself comfortable and look at the following pictures 

00:01:01.980 --> 00:01:03.280
 more exactly 

00:01:03.280 --> 00:01:06.280
 Here we go 

00:03:49.579 --> 00:03:51.599
 that was 50 pictures 

00:03:51.599 --> 00:03:55.749
 surely they do not feel that they have all the pictures in their minds 

00:03:55.749 --> 00:03:57.769
 have kept or 

00:03:57.769 --> 00:03:59.009
 but they have 

00:03:59.009 --> 00:04:02.339
 because the brain can remember pictures especially well 

00:04:02.339 --> 00:04:05.669
 and has reliably stored these 50 photos 

00:04:06.469 --> 00:04:08.569
 I will prove it to him 

00:04:08.569 --> 00:04:11.569
 in the second part you see 50 image pairs 

00:04:12.169 --> 00:04:16.439
 in the first part of the picture they once saw the other one 

00:04:16.439 --> 00:04:18.120
 each new 

00:04:18.120 --> 00:04:21.580
 Just point to the picture you have already seen before
