00:00:05.330 --> 00:00:09.540
 and everyone says goodbye with six 

00:00:08.790 --> 00:00:12.269
 good 

00:00:09.540 --> 00:00:15.500
 look here over a video and it is not 

00:00:12.269 --> 00:00:19.050
 monster adventures but rather demonstrate 

00:00:15.500 --> 00:00:22.050
 legends of where I am here in my 

00:00:19.050 --> 00:00:25.230
 main profile is right and I 'm going 

00:00:22.050 --> 00:00:29.070
 start slowly slowly it right here not 

00:00:25.230 --> 00:00:29.580
 will become a series will turn the tips and 

00:00:29.070 --> 00:00:32.070
 everything else 

00:00:29.580 --> 00:00:35.370
 only that there will be very few people because 

00:00:32.070 --> 00:00:37.620
 we are focused there in the advent of 

00:00:35.370 --> 00:00:39.960
 everything else now that we come close 

00:00:37.620 --> 00:00:43.399
 end of the event and 

00:00:39.960 --> 00:00:49.950
 Taking too long to record everything else there. 

00:00:43.399 --> 00:00:52.530
 Come on, we'll take it and make a complement. 

00:00:49.950 --> 00:00:54.800
 It's okay here, I'll use this 

00:00:52.530 --> 00:00:58.859
 profile here would pay you 

00:00:54.800 --> 00:01:03.510
 Crossing Tips From Battles Or More 

00:00:58.859 --> 00:01:07.830
 of the beauty then with much calm neither without 

00:01:03.510 --> 00:01:11.729
 afflictions my people and i'll give a tip 

00:01:07.830 --> 00:01:13.979
 It's very simple today, it's can be useful for 

00:01:11.729 --> 00:01:17.159
 some other people may find 

00:01:13.979 --> 00:01:19.439
 no use but just think a little bit you 

00:01:17.159 --> 00:01:21.060
 You'll see her utility is right. 

00:01:19.439 --> 00:01:25.200
 I came to bring something here for you. 

00:01:21.060 --> 00:01:29.909
 What a lot of people get curious, will not I? 

00:01:25.200 --> 00:01:34.320
 to apply construct constructions that 

00:01:29.909 --> 00:01:36.180
 or was in particular the case of the streets 

00:01:34.320 --> 00:01:37.979
 customize your monsters here with 

00:01:36.180 --> 00:01:41.009
 powerful waves and left even more 

00:01:37.979 --> 00:01:42.750
 strong if the person is a good man is not cheap 

00:01:41.009 --> 00:01:43.740
 so the people are lying in buying 

00:01:42.750 --> 00:01:45.899
 Yes or no 

00:01:43.740 --> 00:01:49.229
 Good people, I'll explain to you how it is 

00:01:45.899 --> 00:01:52.110
 that runs the runes house you go 

00:01:49.229 --> 00:01:53.790
 buy her normal will select one 

00:01:52.110 --> 00:01:55.110
 group of friends to open it and 

00:01:53.790 --> 00:01:56.430
 As soon as it's open it's going to stay 

00:01:55.110 --> 00:01:58.710
 so it's ok 

00:01:56.430 --> 00:01:59.610
 what will you do you will select 

00:01:58.710 --> 00:02:02.810
 a monster 

00:01:59.610 --> 00:02:06.510
 we were so sorry that my lyoto 

00:02:02.810 --> 00:02:09.149
 lyoto is already ruined seeing 

00:02:06.510 --> 00:02:10.830
 So what happens here are the 

00:02:09.149 --> 00:02:13.370
 inventories of streets that I have then 

00:02:10.830 --> 00:02:17.819
 I think I can use it and I put it 

00:02:13.370 --> 00:02:19.620
 so I click on it and choose yes to 

00:02:17.819 --> 00:02:21.810
 street will be filled mine and 

00:02:19.620 --> 00:02:23.880
 touch is one that increases the life of the 

00:02:21.810 --> 00:02:27.390
 monster in 10% 

00:02:23.880 --> 00:02:29.610
 detail when you put rue 

00:02:27.390 --> 00:02:32.100
 can no longer be withdrawn and normally 

00:02:29.610 --> 00:02:35.970
 can only be placed right 

00:02:32.100 --> 00:02:37.980
 two streets lyoto has this street here is 

00:02:35.970 --> 00:02:40.230
 then all the monsters have a round already 

00:02:37.980 --> 00:02:42.450
 properly inside 

00:02:40.230 --> 00:02:45.120
 we the people get the whip that ita 

00:02:42.450 --> 00:02:49.739
 even he does not have a routine 

00:02:45.120 --> 00:02:51.900
 all the good to discover that it is not 

00:02:49.739 --> 00:02:54.720
 so something most monsters have 

00:02:51.900 --> 00:02:56.790
 with rue already own of the immunity 

00:02:54.720 --> 00:02:58.200
 effects of blindness each has a 

00:02:56.790 --> 00:03:01.170
 thing is 

00:02:58.200 --> 00:03:03.300
 and that's it you can add a 

00:03:01.170 --> 00:03:09.780
 new round they nÃ© 

00:03:03.300 --> 00:03:13.380
 So let's get it here. Let's go this way. 

00:03:09.780 --> 00:03:15.480
 that all effects are 20% less than 

00:03:13.380 --> 00:03:18.480
 chance of happening and we can 

00:03:15.480 --> 00:03:19.739
 put some streets here he's what 

00:03:18.480 --> 00:03:31.680
 are the streets that we will find 

00:03:19.739 --> 00:03:34.980
 special people can only be items 

00:03:31.680 --> 00:03:36.150
 runes are here you will see some streets 

00:03:34.980 --> 00:03:39.989
 that's right 

00:03:36.150 --> 00:03:42.299
 only that the higher your level the better 

00:03:39.989 --> 00:03:45.720
 it's the runes that's the first one that costs 

00:03:42.299 --> 00:03:49.950
 2.5 and causes me 15% more than a year in 

00:03:45.720 --> 00:03:52.260
 strong attacks are then when an attack 

00:03:49.950 --> 00:03:57.630
 see the fort above 50 plus or 

00:03:52.260 --> 00:04:00.209
 less then it will increase by 15% more 

00:03:57.630 --> 00:04:02.070
 damage is good to increase damage 

00:04:00.209 --> 00:04:03.960
 only you can not withdraw and that's only 

00:04:02.070 --> 00:04:07.450
 will work for a monster 

00:04:03.960 --> 00:04:10.330
 increases the monster's doubt by 10% 250 

00:04:07.450 --> 00:04:15.790
 ' he ' also has to have the other one 

00:04:10.330 --> 00:04:17.799
 which increases the monster's life by 20% nec 

00:04:15.790 --> 00:04:20.500
 in case we go 

00:04:17.799 --> 00:04:22.210
 We'll pick it up and add 

00:04:20.500 --> 00:04:24.790
 his life problems 

00:04:22.210 --> 00:04:28.690
 we have because they reduce energy expenditure 

00:04:24.790 --> 00:04:32.260
 in 2001, which reduces spending by four 

00:04:28.690 --> 00:04:33.820
 skills and we start to increase 

00:04:32.260 --> 00:04:36.330
 damage of all monsters that are 

00:04:33.820 --> 00:04:39.460
 interesting soccer 2% only then is little 

00:04:36.330 --> 00:04:40.960
 and so is tracking damage increase 

00:04:39.460 --> 00:04:43.750
 in four I think it 's a bit more 

00:04:40.960 --> 00:04:46.540
 interesting increases the speed of 

00:04:43.750 --> 00:04:51.250
 all in 2 increases everyone's speed 

00:04:46.540 --> 00:04:53.110
 in 4 increases the life of 2 cm of only frame 

00:04:51.250 --> 00:04:54.880
 that's what happens as it goes 

00:04:53.110 --> 00:04:56.590
 increasing the level was appearing 

00:04:54.880 --> 00:04:58.540
 but then maybe you do not have it all 

00:04:56.590 --> 00:05:00.040
 This is the time I level up. 

00:04:58.540 --> 00:05:01.750
 that is appearing more 

00:05:00.040 --> 00:05:04.210
 so do not put on hold in a 

00:05:01.750 --> 00:05:06.340
 monster ends there and then you put 

00:05:04.210 --> 00:05:08.410
 how to know what to put the book on sale 

00:05:06.340 --> 00:05:10.870
 two monsters 

00:05:08.410 --> 00:05:14.260
 here's this monster we're going to put 

00:05:10.870 --> 00:05:17.350
 he has a low attack is speed 

00:05:14.260 --> 00:05:19.510
 average high life and low energy that they 

00:05:17.350 --> 00:05:21.190
 can put on an attack suit and a 

00:05:19.510 --> 00:05:22.210
 street of energy being so he gets half 

00:05:21.190 --> 00:05:24.370
 that balanced 

00:05:22.210 --> 00:05:26.260
 This is it, you will see in the bass and 

00:05:24.370 --> 00:05:28.000
 increase here in this you go 

00:05:26.260 --> 00:05:29.710
 place their attack zones is because 

00:05:28.000 --> 00:05:32.530
 He is already very fast very fast. 

00:05:29.710 --> 00:05:34.030
 life and has energy and in turn then 

00:05:32.530 --> 00:05:36.070
 know how to choose 

00:05:34.030 --> 00:05:37.150
 be patient and that's it my people 

00:05:36.070 --> 00:05:39.070
