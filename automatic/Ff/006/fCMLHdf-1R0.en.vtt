00:00:03.590 --> 00:00:03.600 
okay so sometimes some of you may be

00:00:03.600 --> 00:00:05.269 
okay so sometimes some of you may be
wondering<00:00:03.750> how<00:00:04.230> exactly<00:00:04.620> i'm<00:00:04.770> going<00:00:04.950> to<00:00:05.069> shine

00:00:05.269 --> 00:00:05.279 
wondering how exactly i'm going to shine

00:00:05.279 --> 00:00:08.780 
wondering how exactly i'm going to shine
not<00:00:06.060> much<00:00:06.330> really<00:00:06.750> i<00:00:07.560> just<00:00:07.919> see<00:00:08.099> their<00:00:08.280> do<00:00:08.429> one

00:00:08.780 --> 00:00:08.790 
not much really i just see their do one

00:00:08.790 --> 00:00:10.850 
not much really i just see their do one
method<00:00:09.000> or<00:00:09.660> the<00:00:09.690> other<00:00:09.900> actually<00:00:10.559> have<00:00:10.710> three

00:00:10.850 --> 00:00:10.860 
method or the other actually have three

00:00:10.860 --> 00:00:12.560 
method or the other actually have three
methods<00:00:11.280> but<00:00:11.460> one<00:00:11.700> of<00:00:11.820> the<00:00:11.910> man<00:00:12.090> leaves<00:00:12.300> for

00:00:12.560 --> 00:00:12.570 
methods but one of the man leaves for

00:00:12.570 --> 00:00:16.129 
methods but one of the man leaves for
the<00:00:12.660> in<00:00:12.750> that<00:00:12.870> tree<00:00:14.030> anyways<00:00:15.030> my<00:00:15.900> primary

00:00:16.129 --> 00:00:16.139 
the in that tree anyways my primary

00:00:16.139 --> 00:00:19.429 
the in that tree anyways my primary
method<00:00:16.830> is<00:00:17.039> going<00:00:17.730> from<00:00:17.880> beetle<00:00:18.330> y<00:00:18.810> which<00:00:19.230> is<00:00:19.260> a

00:00:19.429 --> 00:00:19.439 
method is going from beetle y which is a

00:00:19.439 --> 00:00:25.060 
method is going from beetle y which is a
sliding<00:00:19.890> method<00:00:22.880> nothing<00:00:23.880> much<00:00:24.029> really<00:00:24.449> it's

00:00:25.060 --> 00:00:25.070 
sliding method nothing much really it's

00:00:25.070 --> 00:00:27.800 
sliding method nothing much really it's
kind<00:00:26.070> of<00:00:26.189> hard<00:00:26.369> at<00:00:26.519> first<00:00:26.550> but<00:00:27.060> if<00:00:27.240> you<00:00:27.359> give<00:00:27.779> it

00:00:27.800 --> 00:00:27.810 
kind of hard at first but if you give it

00:00:27.810 --> 00:00:30.550 
kind of hard at first but if you give it
some<00:00:28.019> practice<00:00:28.410> it's<00:00:28.859> not<00:00:29.160> too<00:00:29.580> difficult

00:00:30.550 --> 00:00:30.560 
some practice it's not too difficult

00:00:30.560 --> 00:00:33.350 
some practice it's not too difficult
another<00:00:31.560> method<00:00:31.830> i<00:00:32.099> use<00:00:32.279> mostly<00:00:32.700> for<00:00:32.969> falco

00:00:33.350 --> 00:00:33.360 
another method i use mostly for falco

00:00:33.360 --> 00:00:37.940 
another method i use mostly for falco
just<00:00:33.690> because<00:00:34.079> he<00:00:34.260> started<00:00:34.649> so<00:00:34.770> freaking<00:00:35.160> slow

00:00:37.940 --> 00:00:37.950 

00:00:37.950 --> 00:00:40.430 

put<00:00:38.520> your<00:00:38.700> index<00:00:39.330> finger<00:00:39.840> on<00:00:39.990> being<00:00:40.230> your

00:00:40.430 --> 00:00:40.440 
put your index finger on being your

00:00:40.440 --> 00:00:42.590 
put your index finger on being your
little<00:00:40.530> finger<00:00:40.890> on<00:00:41.040> X<00:00:41.340> and<00:00:41.700> just<00:00:42.270> alternate

00:00:42.590 --> 00:00:42.600 
little finger on X and just alternate

00:00:42.600 --> 00:00:45.200 
little finger on X and just alternate
between<00:00:42.810> a<00:00:43.050> necessity<00:00:43.440> can<00:00:43.920> there<00:00:44.700> is<00:00:44.910> timing

00:00:45.200 --> 00:00:45.210 
between a necessity can there is timing

00:00:45.210 --> 00:00:47.500 
between a necessity can there is timing
required<00:00:45.780> if<00:00:46.110> you<00:00:46.230> want<00:00:46.410> to<00:00:46.530> do<00:00:46.620> slower<00:00:46.950> shines

00:00:47.500 --> 00:00:47.510 
required if you want to do slower shines

00:00:47.510 --> 00:00:54.590 
required if you want to do slower shines
um<00:00:50.180> just<00:00:51.180> hold<00:00:51.900> B<00:00:52.200> then<00:00:53.160> as<00:00:53.580> fast<00:00:53.850> as<00:00:53.970> you<00:00:54.090> can<00:00:54.270> x

00:00:54.590 --> 00:00:54.600 
um just hold B then as fast as you can x

00:00:54.600 --> 00:01:00.170 
um just hold B then as fast as you can x
and<00:00:55.020> then<00:00:55.200> be<00:00:57.890> from<00:00:58.890> Alton<00:00:59.220> well<00:00:59.640> our

00:01:00.170 --> 00:01:00.180 
and then be from Alton well our

00:01:00.180 --> 00:01:03.740 
and then be from Alton well our

little pencil be 2x and then a and then
are<00:01:19.259> from<00:01:19.860> ok<00:01:21.380> I<00:01:23.030> don't<00:01:24.030> really<00:01:24.240> use<00:01:24.479> the

00:01:24.590 --> 00:01:24.600 
are from ok I don't really use the

00:01:24.600 --> 00:01:26.600 
are from ok I don't really use the
c-stick<00:01:25.050> much<00:01:25.320> except<00:01:25.740> for<00:01:25.920> uh<00:01:25.950> pairs<00:01:26.280> but

00:01:26.600 --> 00:01:26.610 
c-stick much except for uh pairs but

00:01:26.610 --> 00:01:30.170 
c-stick much except for uh pairs but
even<00:01:27.090> with<00:01:27.650> shine<00:01:28.650> shuffles<00:01:29.340> I<00:01:29.520> don't<00:01:29.729> use<00:01:29.970> it

00:01:30.170 --> 00:01:30.180 
even with shine shuffles I don't use it

00:01:30.180 --> 00:01:36.499 
even with shine shuffles I don't use it
and<00:01:30.780> just<00:01:32.570> as<00:01:33.570> much<00:01:33.780> um<00:01:34.310> and<00:01:35.310> as<00:01:35.970> for<00:01:36.240> the<00:01:36.360> other

and just as much um and as for the other

00:01:36.509 --> 00:01:39.320 
and just as much um and as for the other
method<00:01:36.810> I<00:01:37.140> use<00:01:37.350> it's<00:01:38.190> kind<00:01:38.759> of<00:01:38.880> rare<00:01:39.030> that<00:01:39.270> I

00:01:39.320 --> 00:01:39.330 
method I use it's kind of rare that I

00:01:39.330 --> 00:01:41.630 
method I use it's kind of rare that I
ever<00:01:39.540> use<00:01:39.840> it<00:01:40.050> but<00:01:40.259> mostly<00:01:41.100> use<00:01:41.280> it<00:01:41.430> when<00:01:41.550> I'm

00:01:41.630 --> 00:01:41.640 
ever use it but mostly use it when I'm

00:01:41.640 --> 00:01:43.760 
ever use it but mostly use it when I'm
just<00:01:41.820> having<00:01:42.030> fun<00:01:42.060> go<00:01:42.960> to<00:01:43.020> have<00:01:43.259> that<00:01:43.440> tree<00:01:43.740> and

00:01:43.760 --> 00:01:43.770 
just having fun go to have that tree and

00:01:43.770 --> 00:01:46.630 
just having fun go to have that tree and
I<00:01:44.250> just<00:01:44.789> push<00:01:45.149> up<00:01:45.390> which<00:01:45.750> would<00:01:45.960> be<00:01:46.080> down

00:01:46.630 --> 00:01:46.640 
I just push up which would be down

00:01:46.640 --> 00:01:49.330 
I just push up which would be down
and<00:01:46.850> I<00:01:46.909> put<00:01:47.090> my<00:01:47.180> left<00:01:47.390> thumb<00:01:47.840> I<00:01:48.260> put<00:01:49.100> a<00:01:49.130> little

the other end on B and just go back and

00:01:55.729 --> 00:02:02.640 
the other end on B and just go back and
forth<00:01:56.000> lastima<00:01:56.690> que<00:01:58.150> again<00:02:01.030> sliding
