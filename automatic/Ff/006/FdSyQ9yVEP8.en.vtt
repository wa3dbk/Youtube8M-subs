 branch failure 

00:00:25.460 --> 00:00:27.140

00:00:49.720 --> 00:00:52.720
 if not commented 

00:00:54.630 --> 00:00:57.650
 when I 

00:00:57.650 --> 00:01:00.650
 June price 

00:01:01.330 --> 00:01:04.330
 royal 

00:01:08.900 --> 00:01:11.900
 person 

00:01:27.920 --> 00:01:30.920
 restore 

00:01:32.250 --> 00:01:34.170
 yes i guess 

00:01:34.170 --> 00:01:36.090
 two al Qaeda leaders 

00:01:36.090 --> 00:01:37.950
 neighbors 

00:01:37.950 --> 00:01:40.650
 having started 

00:01:40.650 --> 00:01:43.650
 de janeiro we are not 

00:02:15.419 --> 00:02:18.419
 for this you need to work 

00:02:26.649 --> 00:02:28.359
 an incident 

00:02:28.359 --> 00:02:31.359
 what is more important to you than the trading floor 

00:02:34.199 --> 00:02:37.199
 so coincided that he wishes 

00:02:39.309 --> 00:02:40.759
 all these banks started 

00:02:40.759 --> 00:02:43.759
 as reported on the party website 

00:02:58.369 --> 00:03:01.629
 the main thing is that the turnover exceeds 20 thousand 

00:04:12.649 --> 00:04:15.649
 however expect 

00:04:38.529 --> 00:04:39.740
 also 

00:04:39.740 --> 00:04:42.740

 but a down 

00:05:23.789 --> 00:05:26.409
 for 20 countries 

00:05:26.409 --> 00:05:28.749
 speaking of this stated this election 

00:05:28.749 --> 00:05:31.749
 were honest words 

00:05:35.460 --> 00:05:38.460
 it seemed a little 

00:06:35.669 --> 00:06:38.669
 then 

00:07:13.490 --> 00:07:16.490
 not by chance 

00:07:48.309 --> 00:07:49.539
 I have seen 

00:07:49.539 --> 00:07:52.189
 and this began to unfold and 

00:07:52.189 --> 00:07:54.679
 more technology 

00:07:54.679 --> 00:07:56.629
 about the fact that he poisoned the site
