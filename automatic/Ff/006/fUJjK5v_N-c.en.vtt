00:00:27.650 --> 00:00:27.660 
strange angle because there is so much

00:00:27.660 --> 00:00:29.779 
strange angle because there is so much
glare<00:00:28.140> going<00:00:28.529> on<00:00:28.680> because<00:00:28.980> I<00:00:29.099> have<00:00:29.189> two<00:00:29.400> big

to look at my how more my sump
let's<00:00:37.110> say<00:00:37.290> so<00:00:38.100> this<00:00:38.219> is<00:00:38.460> my<00:00:38.820> sump<00:00:39.210> it's<00:00:39.480> a

00:00:39.790 --> 00:00:39.800 
let's say so this is my sump it's a

00:00:39.800 --> 00:00:43.610 
let's say so this is my sump it's a
wet/dry<00:00:40.800> filter<00:00:41.250> and<00:00:41.520> right<00:00:42.030> now<00:00:42.210> I<00:00:42.510> have<00:00:42.989> two

00:00:43.610 --> 00:00:43.620 
wet/dry filter and right now I have two

00:00:43.620 --> 00:00:47.270 
wet/dry filter and right now I have two
drains<00:00:44.160> I<00:00:44.899> need<00:00:45.899> to<00:00:45.960> fix<00:00:46.170> this<00:00:46.559> one<00:00:46.829> right<00:00:46.980> here

00:00:47.270 --> 00:00:47.280 
drains I need to fix this one right here

00:00:47.280 --> 00:00:50.000 
drains I need to fix this one right here
to<00:00:47.579> make<00:00:47.730> it<00:00:47.910> have<00:00:48.210> an<00:00:48.360> angle<00:00:48.719> so<00:00:49.079> the<00:00:49.379> tube

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:50.010 
to make it have an angle so the tube

00:00:50.010 --> 00:00:53.000 
to make it have an angle so the tube
isn't<00:00:50.219> kinked<00:00:51.059> so<00:00:51.329> much<00:00:51.510> I<00:00:51.780> got<00:00:52.530> some<00:00:52.680> filter

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:53.010 
isn't kinked so much I got some filter

00:00:53.010 --> 00:00:55.220 
isn't kinked so much I got some filter
floss<00:00:53.129> and<00:00:53.579> then<00:00:53.730> it's<00:00:54.000> a<00:00:54.270> wet/dry<00:00:54.660> filter<00:00:54.989> I

00:00:55.220 --> 00:00:55.230 
floss and then it's a wet/dry filter I

00:00:55.230 --> 00:00:58.520 
floss and then it's a wet/dry filter I
have<00:00:55.770> some<00:00:56.160> of<00:00:56.250> this<00:00:56.690> these<00:00:57.690> little<00:00:57.930> sponge

00:00:58.520 --> 00:00:58.530

have some of this these little sponge
pad<00:00:58.770> things<00:00:59.070> in<00:00:59.280> the<00:00:59.789> restaurant<00:00:59.940> bio-balls

00:01:00.740 --> 00:01:00.750 
pad things in the restaurant bio-balls

00:01:00.750 --> 00:01:06.230 
pad things in the restaurant bio-balls
and<00:01:01.550> in<00:01:02.550> here<00:01:03.210> I<00:01:03.589> have<00:01:04.589> just<00:01:05.250> some<00:01:05.519> ceramic

00:01:06.230 --> 00:01:06.240 
and in here I have just some ceramic

00:01:06.240 --> 00:01:11.870 
and in here I have just some ceramic
media<00:01:06.659> and<00:01:06.930> the<00:01:07.920> pump<00:01:08.189> is<00:01:08.430> a<00:01:09.030> Rio<00:01:09.890> 17<00:01:10.890> HF<00:01:11.640> which

00:01:11.870 --> 00:01:11.880 
media and the pump is a Rio 17 HF which

00:01:11.880 --> 00:01:16.130 
media and the pump is a Rio 17 HF which
is<00:01:12.030> hyper<00:01:12.240> flow<00:01:12.600> it<00:01:13.409> does<00:01:13.680> about<00:01:14.780> thousand<00:01:15.780> 90

00:01:16.130 --> 00:01:16.140 
is hyper flow it does about thousand 90

00:01:16.140 --> 00:01:18.350 
is hyper flow it does about thousand 90
gallons<00:01:16.530> per<00:01:16.920> hour<00:01:17.009> at<00:01:17.400> one<00:01:17.640> foot<00:01:17.850> of<00:01:17.970> head

00:01:18.350 --> 00:01:18.360 
gallons per hour at one foot of head

00:01:18.360 --> 00:01:20.300 
gallons per hour at one foot of head
I<00:01:18.390> believe<00:01:19.320> it<00:01:19.439> does<00:01:19.470> somewhere<00:01:19.890> around<00:01:20.009> 800

00:01:20.300 --> 00:01:20.310 
I believe it does somewhere around 800

00:01:20.310 --> 00:01:22.490 
I believe it does somewhere around 800
gallons<00:01:20.850> per<00:01:21.090> hour<00:01:21.180> at<00:01:21.570> 4<00:01:21.869> for<00:01:22.049> the<00:01:22.110> ped<00:01:22.290> which

00:01:22.490 --> 00:01:22.500 
gallons per hour at 4 for the ped which

00:01:22.500 --> 00:01:24.440 
gallons per hour at 4 for the ped which
is<00:01:22.650> what's<00:01:22.860> pumping<00:01:23.250> out<00:01:23.340> right<00:01:23.460> now<00:01:23.610> I<00:01:23.880> also

00:01:24.440 --> 00:01:24.450 
is what's pumping out right now I also

00:01:24.450 --> 00:01:27.940 
is what's pumping out right now I also
have<00:01:24.780> this<00:01:25.080> UV<00:01:25.560> sterilizer<00:01:26.100> plumbed<00:01:26.700> in

00:01:27.940 --> 00:01:27.950 
have this UV sterilizer plumbed in

00:01:27.950 --> 00:01:30.250 
have this UV sterilizer plumbed in
I<00:01:27.979> think<00:01:28.430> it's<00:01:28.550> kind<00:01:29.540> of<00:01:29.570> neat<00:01:29.750> how<00:01:29.870> I<00:01:29.900> did<00:01:30.110> it

00:01:30.250 --> 00:01:30.260 
I think it's kind of neat how I did it

00:01:30.260 --> 00:01:33.790 
I think it's kind of neat how I did it
or<00:01:30.470> it<00:01:30.860> looks<00:01:31.070> tidy<00:01:32.080> because<00:01:33.080> it's<00:01:33.350> up<00:01:33.470> in<00:01:33.650> the

00:01:33.790 --> 00:01:33.800 
or it looks tidy because it's up in the

00:01:33.800 --> 00:01:36.219 
or it looks tidy because it's up in the
corner<00:01:34.100> you<00:01:34.190> can't<00:01:34.370> see<00:01:34.700> it<00:01:34.790> but<00:01:35.600> I<00:01:35.810> put<00:01:36.080> hoe

00:01:36.219 --> 00:01:36.229 
corner you can't see it but I put hoe

00:01:36.229 --> 00:01:37.660 
corner you can't see it but I put hoe
stumps<00:01:36.619> and<00:01:36.710> everything<00:01:37.040> to<00:01:37.190> prevent<00:01:37.490> any

00:01:37.660 --> 00:01:37.670 
stumps and everything to prevent any

00:01:37.670 --> 00:01:39.420 
stumps and everything to prevent any
leaks<00:01:37.909> and

00:01:39.420 --> 00:01:39.430 
leaks and

00:01:39.430 --> 00:01:42.120 
leaks and
and<00:01:39.840> it<00:01:40.840> goes<00:01:41.020> to<00:01:41.230> the<00:01:41.320> wall<00:01:41.470> actually<00:01:42.010> how<00:01:42.100> to

00:01:42.120 --> 00:01:42.130 
and it goes to the wall actually how to

00:01:42.130 --> 00:01:44.370 
and it goes to the wall actually how to
modify<00:01:42.460> the<00:01:42.610> stand<00:01:43.030> as<00:01:43.360> you<00:01:44.020> can<00:01:44.170> see<00:01:44.350> I

00:01:44.370 --> 00:01:44.380 
modify the stand as you can see I

00:01:44.380 --> 00:01:46.290 
modify the stand as you can see I
installed<00:01:45.130> this<00:01:45.310> two<00:01:45.580> by<00:01:45.760> six<00:01:46.060> right<00:01:46.270> here

00:01:46.290 --> 00:01:46.300 
installed this two by six right here

00:01:46.300 --> 00:01:49.740 
installed this two by six right here
because<00:01:46.840> originally<00:01:47.710> there's<00:01:48.430> this<00:01:48.750> divider

00:01:49.740 --> 00:01:49.750 
because originally there's this divider

00:01:49.750 --> 00:01:51.930 
because originally there's this divider
right<00:01:49.870> here<00:01:50.170> in<00:01:50.260> the<00:01:50.320> middle<00:01:50.560> which<00:01:51.280> acted<00:01:51.700> as

00:01:51.930 --> 00:01:51.940 
right here in the middle which acted as

00:01:51.940 --> 00:01:55.440 
right here in the middle which acted as
a<00:01:52.360> major<00:01:52.630> brace<00:01:53.080> for<00:01:53.740> it<00:01:53.860> so<00:01:54.520> I<00:01:54.550> installed<00:01:55.180> the

00:01:55.440 --> 00:01:55.450 
a major brace for it so I installed the

00:01:55.450 --> 00:01:57.270 
a major brace for it so I installed the
two<00:01:55.750> by<00:01:55.900> six<00:01:56.170> and<00:01:56.380> then

00:01:57.270 --> 00:01:57.280 
two by six and then

00:01:57.280 --> 00:01:59.430 
two by six and then
move<00:01:57.640> that<00:01:57.880> off-center<00:01:58.750> so<00:01:58.810> the<00:01:59.020> some<00:01:59.260> could

00:01:59.430 --> 00:01:59.440 
move that off-center so the some could

00:01:59.440 --> 00:02:02.670 
move that off-center so the some could
fit<00:01:59.650> but<00:02:00.610> anyways<00:02:01.000> the<00:02:01.180> tubing<00:02:01.540> goes<00:02:01.810> through

00:02:02.670 --> 00:02:02.680 
fit but anyways the tubing goes through

00:02:02.680 --> 00:02:04.830 
fit but anyways the tubing goes through
the<00:02:02.799> hole<00:02:02.979> out<00:02:03.220> the<00:02:03.340> other<00:02:03.490> hand<00:02:03.729> and<00:02:04.060> I<00:02:04.570> have

00:02:04.830 --> 00:02:04.840 
the hole out the other hand and I have

00:02:04.840 --> 00:02:06.870 
the hole out the other hand and I have
it<00:02:05.020> actually<00:02:05.260> split<00:02:06.040> off<00:02:06.250> right<00:02:06.580> there<00:02:06.759> with

00:02:06.870 --> 00:02:06.880 
it actually split off right there with

00:02:06.880 --> 00:02:08.910 
it actually split off right there with
the<00:02:06.940> Y<00:02:07.090> fitting<00:02:07.509> that<00:02:07.630> goes<00:02:07.750> into<00:02:07.930> two<00:02:08.229> Jet's

00:02:08.910 --> 00:02:08.920 
the Y fitting that goes into two Jet's

00:02:08.920 --> 00:02:11.610 
the Y fitting that goes into two Jet's
I<00:02:09.060> like<00:02:10.060> these<00:02:10.360> right<00:02:10.869> here<00:02:11.080> they're<00:02:11.410> fully

00:02:11.610 --> 00:02:11.620

rated for a hundred gallon tank I have
this<00:02:51.400> I'm<00:02:51.819> probably<00:02:52.120> going<00:02:52.540> to<00:02:52.630> do<00:02:52.810> some

00:02:53.100 --> 00:02:53.110 
this I'm probably going to do some

00:02:53.110 --> 00:02:55.320 
this I'm probably going to do some
inline<00:02:53.470> co2<00:02:54.010> diffusion<00:02:54.519> maybe<00:02:54.790> if<00:02:55.120> I<00:02:55.269> do

00:02:55.320 --> 00:02:55.330 
inline co2 diffusion maybe if I do

00:02:55.330 --> 00:02:57.000 
inline co2 diffusion maybe if I do
choose<00:02:55.930> to<00:02:55.989> do<00:02:56.200> that<00:02:56.319> I'm<00:02:56.500> going<00:02:56.620> to<00:02:56.680> use<00:02:56.830> the

00:02:57.000 --> 00:02:57.010 
choose to do that I'm going to use the

00:02:57.010 --> 00:02:59.420 
choose to do that I'm going to use the
flooville<00:02:57.370> and<00:02:57.580> also<00:02:58.390> I<00:02:58.420> use<00:02:58.720> it<00:02:58.930> for

00:02:59.420 --> 00:02:59.430 
flooville and also I use it for

00:02:59.430 --> 00:03:02.130 
flooville and also I use it for
mechanical<00:03:00.430> filtration<00:03:00.730> because<00:03:01.299> you<00:03:01.870> can't

00:03:02.130 --> 00:03:02.140 
mechanical filtration because you can't

00:03:02.140 --> 00:03:04.350 
mechanical filtration because you can't
fit<00:03:02.350> too<00:03:02.530> many<00:03:02.709> sponges<00:03:02.920> in<00:03:03.489> there<00:03:03.910> so<00:03:04.299> I'm

00:03:04.350 --> 00:03:04.360 
fit too many sponges in there so I'm

00:03:04.360 --> 00:03:05.670 
fit too many sponges in there so I'm
going<00:03:04.480> to<00:03:04.510> use<00:03:04.630> that<00:03:04.780> for<00:03:04.989> the<00:03:05.019> sponges<00:03:05.440> and

00:03:05.670 --> 00:03:05.680 
going to use that for the sponges and

00:03:05.680 --> 00:03:07.740 
going to use that for the sponges and
then<00:03:06.220> also<00:03:06.340> I<00:03:06.489> have<00:03:06.670> a<00:03:06.700> little<00:03:06.850> DJ<00:03:07.239> bar<00:03:07.450> for<00:03:07.660> all

00:03:07.740 --> 00:03:07.750 
then also I have a little DJ bar for all

00:03:07.750 --> 00:03:10.680 
then also I have a little DJ bar for all
the<00:03:07.870> power<00:03:08.170> and<00:03:08.440> stuff<00:03:08.820> but<00:03:09.820> that<00:03:10.000> is<00:03:10.390> it<00:03:10.660> for

00:03:10.680 --> 00:03:10.690 
the power and stuff but that is it for

00:03:10.690 --> 00:03:13.440 
the power and stuff but that is it for
the<00:03:10.959> plumbing<00:03:11.290> there<00:03:11.739> is<00:03:12.040> you<00:03:12.700> can<00:03:12.850> see<00:03:13.030> under

that's<00:03:20.110> under<00:03:20.290> my<00:03:20.349> stand<00:03:20.680> I<00:03:20.890> try<00:03:21.129> to<00:03:21.189> make<00:03:21.340> it

00:03:21.360 --> 00:03:21.370 
that's under my stand I try to make it

00:03:21.370 --> 00:03:25.350 
that's under my stand I try to make it
look<00:03:21.879> kind<00:03:22.420> of<00:03:22.540> neat<00:03:22.720> as<00:03:22.959> I<00:03:23.110> could<00:03:23.549> but<00:03:24.549> anyway

00:03:26.789 --> 00:03:26.799 
so that's the plumbing part I'm going to

00:03:26.799 --> 00:03:28.530 
so that's the plumbing part I'm going to
come<00:03:26.950> back<00:03:27.069> to<00:03:27.280> you<00:03:27.370> when<00:03:27.819> I<00:03:27.879> do<00:03:28.030> aquascape
