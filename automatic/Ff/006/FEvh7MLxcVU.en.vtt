00:00:32.930 --> 00:00:32.940 
of the the hardware that developers were

00:00:32.940 --> 00:00:34.100 
of the the hardware that developers were
having<00:00:33.120> a<00:00:33.180> hard<00:00:33.329> time<00:00:33.360> figuring<00:00:33.690> out<00:00:33.899> how<00:00:34.079> to

having a hard time figuring out how to
make<00:00:34.320> work<00:00:34.530> is<00:00:34.760> largely<00:00:35.760> functional<00:00:36.270> now<00:00:36.390> so

00:00:36.620 --> 00:00:36.630 
make work is largely functional now so

00:00:36.630 --> 00:00:37.880 
make work is largely functional now so
for<00:00:36.750> instance<00:00:37.050> let's<00:00:37.260> take<00:00:37.380> a<00:00:37.410> look<00:00:37.590> at<00:00:37.829> a

00:00:37.880 --> 00:00:37.890 
for instance let's take a look at a

00:00:37.890 --> 00:00:41.299 
for instance let's take a look at a
camera<00:00:38.250> application<00:00:38.550> here<00:00:39.980> we<00:00:40.980> can<00:00:41.100> snap

00:00:41.299 --> 00:00:41.309 
camera application here we can snap

00:00:41.309 --> 00:00:44.000 
camera application here we can snap
photos<00:00:41.610> you<00:00:42.510> can<00:00:42.600> see<00:00:42.660> that<00:00:42.930> you<00:00:43.680> know<00:00:43.800> it

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:44.010 
photos you can see that you know it

00:00:44.010 --> 00:00:45.680 
photos you can see that you know it
takes<00:00:44.489> a<00:00:44.610> moment<00:00:44.730> for<00:00:45.059> the<00:00:45.149> preview<00:00:45.539> to<00:00:45.660> show

00:00:45.680 --> 00:00:45.690 
takes a moment for the preview to show

00:00:45.690 --> 00:00:47.569 
takes a moment for the preview to show
up<00:00:45.930> and<00:00:46.079> when<00:00:46.170> it<00:00:46.289> does<00:00:46.440> it's<00:00:46.649> sideways<00:00:46.860> but

00:00:47.569 --> 00:00:47.579 
up and when it does it's sideways but

00:00:47.579 --> 00:00:49.160 
up and when it does it's sideways but
the<00:00:47.730> camera<00:00:48.090> is<00:00:48.120> sort<00:00:48.360> of<00:00:48.450> working<00:00:48.809> so<00:00:49.050> you've

00:00:49.160 --> 00:00:49.170 
the camera is sort of working so you've

00:00:49.170 --> 00:00:50.240 
the camera is sort of working so you've
got<00:00:49.260> the<00:00:49.350> front-facing<00:00:49.559> camera

00:00:50.240 --> 00:00:50.250 
got the front-facing camera

00:00:50.250 --> 00:00:52.549 
got the front-facing camera
another<00:00:50.700> holdout<00:00:51.059> up<00:00:51.270> until<00:00:51.539> recently<00:00:52.020> was

00:00:52.549 --> 00:00:52.559 
another holdout up until recently was

00:00:52.559 --> 00:00:54.590 
another holdout up until recently was
bluetooth<00:00:53.039> but<00:00:53.399> now<00:00:53.520> you<00:00:53.579> can<00:00:53.789> see<00:00:53.820> there<00:00:54.420> is<00:00:54.570> a

00:00:54.590 --> 00:00:54.600 
bluetooth but now you can see there is a

00:00:54.600 --> 00:00:56.660 
bluetooth but now you can see there is a
Bluetooth<00:00:55.050> icon<00:00:55.230> then<00:00:55.590> settings<00:00:55.739> and<00:00:56.190> if<00:00:56.579> we

00:00:56.660 --> 00:00:56.670 
Bluetooth icon then settings and if we

00:00:56.670 --> 00:00:59.720 
Bluetooth icon then settings and if we
go<00:00:56.789> in<00:00:56.969> here<00:00:57.270> we<00:00:58.050> can<00:00:58.199> see<00:00:58.230> more<00:00:59.039> Bluetooth<00:00:59.520> and

00:00:59.720 --> 00:00:59.730 
go in here we can see more Bluetooth and

00:00:59.730 --> 00:01:01.580 
go in here we can see more Bluetooth and
we're<00:00:59.820> paired<00:01:00.090> with<00:01:00.270> my<00:01:00.329> phone<00:01:00.719> right<00:01:00.899> now
