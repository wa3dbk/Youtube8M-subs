00:01:11.420 --> 00:01:13.450 

now<00:01:11.900> you<00:01:11.960> see<00:01:12.230> why<00:01:12.440> I<00:01:12.470> wanted<00:01:12.830> to<00:01:12.890> have<00:01:12.980> some

00:01:13.450 --> 00:01:13.460 
now you see why I wanted to have some

00:01:13.460 --> 00:01:26.500 
now you see why I wanted to have some
light<00:01:13.700> areas<00:01:14.180> show

00:01:26.500 --> 00:01:26.510 

00:01:26.510 --> 00:01:28.630 

bloomix<00:01:27.470> and<00:01:27.710> maybe<00:01:27.860> a<00:01:27.920> little<00:01:28.010> bit<00:01:28.190> agreed<00:01:28.490> in

00:01:28.630 --> 00:01:28.640 
bloomix and maybe a little bit agreed in

00:01:28.640 --> 00:01:32.170 
bloomix and maybe a little bit agreed in
there<00:01:28.790> as<00:01:28.910> well<00:01:30.730> remember<00:01:31.730> we've<00:01:31.820> already<00:01:31.880> got

00:01:32.170 --> 00:01:32.180 
there as well remember we've already got

00:01:32.180 --> 00:01:33.910 
there as well remember we've already got
color<00:01:32.390> on<00:01:32.570> there<00:01:32.810> so<00:01:33.050> it'll<00:01:33.200> just<00:01:33.410> make<00:01:33.770> it

00:01:33.910 --> 00:01:33.920 
color on there so it'll just make it

00:01:33.920 --> 00:01:36.760 
color on there so it'll just make it
even<00:01:34.040> darker<00:01:34.190> a<00:01:34.670> few<00:01:35.230> so<00:01:36.230> hopefully<00:01:36.620> you'll

00:01:36.760 --> 00:01:36.770 
even darker a few so hopefully you'll

00:01:36.770 --> 00:01:39.180 
even darker a few so hopefully you'll
see<00:01:37.010> that<00:01:37.280> using<00:01:37.730> rough<00:01:37.970> brushes<00:01:38.420> in<00:01:38.540> this<00:01:38.660> way

00:01:39.180 --> 00:01:39.190
