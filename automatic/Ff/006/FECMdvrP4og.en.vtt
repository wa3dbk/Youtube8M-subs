results I'd like to show you how our

00:00:25.380 --> 00:00:28.070 
results I'd like to show you how our
results<00:00:26.160> change<00:00:26.519> with<00:00:26.820> time<00:00:27.119> when<00:00:27.779> we<00:00:27.930> are

00:00:28.070 --> 00:00:28.080 
results change with time when we are

00:00:28.080 --> 00:00:31.279 
results change with time when we are
working<00:00:28.289> on<00:00:28.650> a<00:00:28.680> task<00:00:29.039> if<00:00:29.570> this<00:00:30.570> is<00:00:30.750> the<00:00:30.840> results

00:00:31.279 --> 00:00:31.289 
working on a task if this is the results

00:00:31.289 --> 00:00:37.040 
working on a task if this is the results
axis<00:00:31.830> and<00:00:33.020> this<00:00:34.020> is<00:00:34.230> the<00:00:34.350> time<00:00:34.680> axis<00:00:35.840> when<00:00:36.840> I

00:00:37.040 --> 00:00:37.050 
axis and this is the time axis when I

00:00:37.050 --> 00:00:39.799 
axis and this is the time axis when I
start<00:00:37.410> to<00:00:37.559> work<00:00:37.590> on<00:00:37.920> a<00:00:37.980> task<00:00:38.340> I<00:00:38.820> start<00:00:39.540> to<00:00:39.660> get

00:00:39.799 --> 00:00:39.809 
start to work on a task I start to get

00:00:39.809 --> 00:00:42.290 
start to work on a task I start to get
some<00:00:40.050> results<00:00:40.290> and<00:00:40.860> if<00:00:41.340> I<00:00:41.460> continue<00:00:41.790> to<00:00:42.120> work

00:00:42.290 --> 00:00:42.300 
some results and if I continue to work

00:00:42.300 --> 00:00:44.299 
some results and if I continue to work
I'll<00:00:42.510> get<00:00:42.690> more<00:00:42.960> results<00:00:43.350> and<00:00:43.710> more<00:00:43.950> results

00:00:44.299 --> 00:00:44.309 
I'll get more results and more results

00:00:44.309 --> 00:00:47.150 
I'll get more results and more results
but<00:00:45.000> at<00:00:45.120> some<00:00:45.329> point<00:00:45.360> this<00:00:46.350> is<00:00:46.410> going<00:00:46.739> to<00:00:46.860> level

00:00:47.150 --> 00:00:47.160 
but at some point this is going to level

00:00:47.160 --> 00:00:50.600 
but at some point this is going to level
off<00:00:47.370> and<00:00:47.730> then<00:00:48.300> diminish<00:00:49.230> now<00:00:50.219> this<00:00:50.430> can

00:00:50.600 --> 00:00:50.610 
off and then diminish now this can

00:00:50.610 --> 00:00:53.240 
off and then diminish now this can
happen<00:00:50.850> for<00:00:51.030> a<00:00:51.180> number<00:00:51.270> of<00:00:51.570> reasons<00:00:51.829> maybe<00:00:52.829> I

00:00:53.240 --> 00:00:53.250 
happen for a number of reasons maybe I

00:00:53.250 --> 00:00:55.160 
happen for a number of reasons maybe I
did<00:00:53.579> what<00:00:53.730> I<00:00:53.760> could<00:00:53.879> and<00:00:54.390> now<00:00:54.449> I<00:00:54.570> need<00:00:54.840> someone

00:00:55.160 --> 00:00:55.170 
did what I could and now I need someone

00:00:55.170 --> 00:00:57.439 
did what I could and now I need someone
else<00:00:55.379> to<00:00:55.590> do<00:00:55.800> their<00:00:55.949> part<00:00:56.370> or<00:00:56.850> maybe<00:00:57.059> I<00:00:57.180> get

00:00:57.439 --> 00:00:57.449 
else to do their part or maybe I get

00:00:57.449 --> 00:01:00.139 
else to do their part or maybe I get
tired<00:00:57.809> and<00:00:58.199> now<00:00:58.710> I'm<00:00:59.039> not<00:00:59.430> productive<00:00:59.820> anymore

00:01:00.139 --> 00:01:00.149 
tired and now I'm not productive anymore

00:01:00.149 --> 00:01:03.410 
tired and now I'm not productive anymore
or<00:01:00.930> maybe<00:01:01.079> I'm<00:01:01.260> done<00:01:01.559> with<00:01:01.770> the<00:01:01.890> task<00:01:02.180> now<00:01:03.180> this

00:01:03.410 --> 00:01:03.420 
or maybe I'm done with the task now this

00:01:03.420 --> 00:01:05.420 
or maybe I'm done with the task now this
is<00:01:03.539> all<00:01:03.719> good<00:01:03.989> in<00:01:04.140> theory<00:01:04.530> does<00:01:05.070> this<00:01:05.189> really

00:01:05.420 --> 00:01:05.430 
is all good in theory does this really

00:01:05.430 --> 00:01:08.780 
is all good in theory does this really
happen<00:01:05.790> in<00:01:06.180> reality<00:01:06.750> what<00:01:07.530> happens<00:01:07.760> after<00:01:08.760> a

00:01:08.780 --> 00:01:08.790 
happen in reality what happens after a

00:01:08.790 --> 00:01:13.070 
happen in reality what happens after a
few<00:01:09.119> minutes<00:01:10.640> after<00:01:11.640> a<00:01:11.670> few<00:01:11.939> minutes<00:01:12.060> I<00:01:12.540> get

00:01:13.070 --> 00:01:13.080 
few minutes after a few minutes I get

00:01:13.080 --> 00:01:16.280 
few minutes after a few minutes I get
interrupted<00:01:13.350> and<00:01:14.210> this<00:01:15.210> can<00:01:15.420> be<00:01:15.570> email<00:01:15.990> the

interrupted and this can be email the

00:01:16.290 --> 00:01:17.870 
interrupted and this can be email the
email<00:01:16.320> beep<00:01:16.799> and<00:01:17.189> I<00:01:17.250> can't<00:01:17.490> resist<00:01:17.670> that

00:01:17.870 --> 00:01:17.880 
email beep and I can't resist that

00:01:17.880 --> 00:01:21.080 
email beep and I can't resist that
temptation<00:01:18.210> or<00:01:19.049> maybe<00:01:19.290> someone<00:01:19.740> stops<00:01:20.100> by<00:01:20.340> now

00:01:21.080 --> 00:01:21.090 
temptation or maybe someone stops by now

temptation or maybe someone stops by now
my<00:01:21.360> results<00:01:21.990> go<00:01:22.650> down<00:01:22.830> to<00:01:23.130> zero<00:01:23.490> and<00:01:23.729> then<00:01:23.900> when

00:01:24.890 --> 00:01:24.900 
my results go down to zero and then when

00:01:24.900 --> 00:01:26.690 
my results go down to zero and then when
I<00:01:24.930> start<00:01:25.290> again<00:01:25.439> and<00:01:25.950> start<00:01:26.220> to<00:01:26.340> make<00:01:26.460> some

00:01:26.690 --> 00:01:26.700 
I start again and start to make some

00:01:26.700 --> 00:01:29.030 
I start again and start to make some
progress<00:01:26.939> I<00:01:27.420> can<00:01:27.869> interrupt<00:01:28.140> it<00:01:28.470> again<00:01:28.740> and

00:01:29.030 --> 00:01:29.040 
progress I can interrupt it again and

00:01:29.040 --> 00:01:31.760 
progress I can interrupt it again and
this<00:01:29.700> time<00:01:29.759> there<00:01:30.570> may<00:01:30.720> be<00:01:30.750> instant<00:01:31.229> messaging

00:01:31.760 --> 00:01:31.770 
this time there may be instant messaging

00:01:31.770 --> 00:01:35.630 
this time there may be instant messaging
or<00:01:32.250> maybe<00:01:32.610> my<00:01:33.180> boss<00:01:33.420> calling<00:01:33.810> and<00:01:34.110> then<00:01:35.070> my

00:01:35.630 --> 00:01:35.640 
or maybe my boss calling and then my

00:01:35.640 --> 00:01:37.580 
or maybe my boss calling and then my
teas<00:01:35.820> also<00:01:36.060> go<00:01:36.180> to<00:01:36.240> zero<00:01:36.570> again<00:01:36.689> and<00:01:37.110> this

00:01:37.580 --> 00:01:37.590 
teas also go to zero again and this

00:01:37.590 --> 00:01:40.819 
teas also go to zero again and this
happens<00:01:38.220> again<00:01:38.850> and<00:01:39.210> again<00:01:39.750> what<00:01:40.650> am<00:01:40.770> i

00:01:40.819 --> 00:01:40.829 
happens again and again what am i

00:01:40.829 --> 00:01:45.340 
happens again and again what am i
describing<00:01:41.159> here<00:01:41.670> this<00:01:42.600> is<00:01:42.869> our<00:01:43.200> life<00:01:43.680> now

00:01:45.340 --> 00:01:45.350 
describing here this is our life now

00:01:45.350 --> 00:01:48.050 
describing here this is our life now
let's<00:01:46.350> stop<00:01:46.710> and<00:01:47.009> talk<00:01:47.640> about<00:01:47.970> the

00:01:48.050 --> 00:01:48.060 
let's stop and talk about the

00:01:48.060 --> 00:01:51.170 
let's stop and talk about the
implications<00:01:48.420> of<00:01:49.110> working<00:01:49.740> this<00:01:49.860> way<00:01:50.180> so

00:01:51.170 --> 00:01:51.180 
implications of working this way so

00:01:51.180 --> 00:01:54.969 
implications of working this way so
first<00:01:51.450> of<00:01:51.600> all<00:01:51.750> if<00:01:52.710> we<00:01:52.920> take<00:01:53.280> a<00:01:53.340> look<00:01:53.579> at<00:01:53.820> these

00:01:54.969 --> 00:01:54.979 
first of all if we take a look at these

00:01:54.979 --> 00:01:58.010 
first of all if we take a look at these
results<00:01:55.979> that<00:01:56.159> I'm<00:01:56.280> getting<00:01:56.640> right<00:01:56.820> here<00:01:57.020> this

00:01:58.010 --> 00:01:58.020 
results that I'm getting right here this

00:01:58.020 --> 00:02:02.749 
results that I'm getting right here this
is<00:01:58.200> only<00:01:58.439> a<00:01:58.649> small<00:01:59.280> fraction<00:01:59.899> maybe<00:02:00.979> five<00:02:01.979> to

00:02:02.749 --> 00:02:02.759 
is only a small fraction maybe five to

00:02:02.759 --> 00:02:06.590 
is only a small fraction maybe five to
ten<00:02:03.229> percent<00:02:04.229> of<00:02:04.500> the<00:02:05.219> total<00:02:05.399> results<00:02:06.090> that<00:02:06.570> I

00:02:06.590 --> 00:02:06.600 
ten percent of the total results that I

00:02:06.600 --> 00:02:09.020 
ten percent of the total results that I
could<00:02:07.049> be<00:02:07.320> getting<00:02:07.560> if<00:02:07.950> I<00:02:08.399> were<00:02:08.610> to<00:02:08.819> stay

00:02:09.020 --> 00:02:09.030 
could be getting if I were to stay

00:02:09.030 --> 00:02:12.740 
could be getting if I were to stay
focused<00:02:09.709> not<00:02:10.709> only<00:02:11.099> this<00:02:11.310> but<00:02:11.629> when<00:02:12.629> I'm

00:02:12.740 --> 00:02:12.750 
focused not only this but when I'm

00:02:12.750 --> 00:02:13.640 
focused not only this but when I'm
working<00:02:13.110> a<00:02:13.200> human

00:02:13.640 --> 00:02:13.650 
working a human

00:02:13.650 --> 00:02:15.319 
working a human
here<00:02:13.950> and<00:02:14.189> a<00:02:14.280> few<00:02:14.430> minutes<00:02:14.730> there<00:02:15.000> I'm

00:02:15.319 --> 00:02:15.329 
here and a few minutes there I'm

00:02:15.329 --> 00:02:17.420 
here and a few minutes there I'm
basically<00:02:16.260> staying<00:02:16.709> at<00:02:16.920> the<00:02:17.069> superficial

00:02:17.420 --> 00:02:17.430 
basically staying at the superficial

00:02:17.430 --> 00:02:20.890 
basically staying at the superficial
level<00:02:18.000> and<00:02:18.450> not<00:02:18.959> getting<00:02:19.230> deep<00:02:19.530> into<00:02:19.920> anything

00:02:20.890 --> 00:02:20.900 
level and not getting deep into anything

00:02:20.900 --> 00:02:24.940 
level and not getting deep into anything
so<00:02:21.900> the<00:02:22.049> point<00:02:22.409> is<00:02:22.799> we<00:02:23.640> need<00:02:23.670> to<00:02:24.269> stay<00:02:24.569> focused

00:02:24.940 --> 00:02:24.950 
so the point is we need to stay focused

00:02:24.950 --> 00:02:29.300 
so the point is we need to stay focused
long<00:02:25.950> enough<00:02:26.459> until<00:02:26.790> we<00:02:27.450> reach<00:02:27.900> this<00:02:28.709> area

00:02:29.300 --> 00:02:29.310 
long enough until we reach this area

00:02:29.310 --> 00:02:32.089 
long enough until we reach this area
right<00:02:29.579> here<00:02:29.810> which<00:02:30.810> we<00:02:31.170> call<00:02:31.500> the

00:02:32.089 --> 00:02:32.099 
right here which we call the

00:02:32.099 --> 00:02:35.509 
right here which we call the
accomplishment<00:02:33.090> zone<00:02:34.129> this<00:02:35.129> is<00:02:35.340> where

00:02:35.509 --> 00:02:35.519 
accomplishment zone this is where

00:02:35.519 --> 00:02:38.000

00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:38.010 
in-depth thinking takes place this is

00:02:38.010 --> 00:02:40.069 
in-depth thinking takes place this is
where<00:02:38.310> creative<00:02:38.810> problem-solving<00:02:39.810> takes

where creative problem-solving takes
place<00:02:40.379> this<00:02:41.129> is<00:02:41.340> where<00:02:41.489> we<00:02:41.640> get<00:02:41.790> meaningful

00:02:42.880 --> 00:02:42.890 
place this is where we get meaningful
