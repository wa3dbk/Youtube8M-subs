00:00:31.859 --> 00:00:36.360
 more tactical or competitive 

00:00:33.300 --> 00:00:37.469
 called me the frieze the worst is that 

00:00:36.360 --> 00:00:39.950
 I was swinging with 

00:00:37.469 --> 00:00:39.950
 shoes m 

00:00:48.600 --> 00:00:51.700
 yop the team his lodges 

00:00:50.350 --> 00:00:52.840
 I hope you are well then 

00:00:51.700 --> 00:00:55.180
 today it's going to be a little video 

00:00:52.840 --> 00:00:56.860
 quite special because I'm really 

00:00:55.180 --> 00:00:58.120
 to piss off I really do not know 

00:00:56.860 --> 00:00:59.200
 what happens then you 

00:00:58.120 --> 00:01:00.670
 do not worry it's not a video I 

00:00:59.200 --> 00:01:02.800
 will tell you that I stop hubinon 

00:01:00.670 --> 00:01:04.839
 I would really like to continue in my 

00:01:02.800 --> 00:01:06.510
 delusion of trolls fashion and where brothel 

00:01:04.839 --> 00:01:09.580
 but what's going on right now 

00:01:06.510 --> 00:01:11.979
 it's quite special and it's a problem 

00:01:09.580 --> 00:01:12.970
 which from what I see among 

00:01:11.979 --> 00:01:15.520
 buddies we will say that 

00:01:12.970 --> 00:01:17.350
 kim is appointed how then I you 

00:01:15.520 --> 00:01:18.640
 explain quickly what happens in 

00:01:17.350 --> 00:01:20.259
 done if you want so I have four 

00:01:18.640 --> 00:01:21.729
 Videos closely since since lÃ© 

00:01:20.259 --> 00:01:23.229
 third day since that's three 

00:01:21.729 --> 00:01:26.020
 days that I have no panic offers us 

00:01:23.229 --> 00:01:29.200
 a little more than 30 days a little more than one 

00:01:26.020 --> 00:01:31.030
 month is actually what happens is 

00:01:29.200 --> 00:01:32.229
 that since the rockstar policy so 

00:01:31.030 --> 00:01:33.790
 I noticed that it's really since 

00:01:32.229 --> 00:01:36.160
 the new rockstar policy they 

00:01:33.790 --> 00:01:38.320
 have inflicted a little bit on youtube 

00:01:36.160 --> 00:01:40.479
 hours so on the glitches the modes 

00:01:38.320 --> 00:01:43.450
 all this is beautiful I can not claude 

00:01:40.479 --> 00:01:45.369
 and fashion trolls and trolls if 

00:01:43.450 --> 00:01:46.960
 certainly but trolls now 

00:01:45.369 --> 00:01:49.210
 actually from the moment we see the 

00:01:46.960 --> 00:01:51.159
 world menu a little too long so there 

00:01:49.210 --> 00:01:52.630
 you saw at the beginning of the video a little 

00:01:51.159 --> 00:01:54.670
 short passage 

00:01:52.630 --> 00:01:56.469
 menu I managed to do that too 

00:01:54.670 --> 00:01:57.880
 on a video that I already had 

00:01:56.469 --> 00:02:00.070
 presented to see if it was going to happen 

00:01:57.880 --> 00:02:02.229
 So so nice is that it works but 

00:02:00.070 --> 00:02:04.450
 the new videos it depends on it happened 

00:02:02.229 --> 00:02:06.759
 95 claude bearers Saturday video 

00:02:04.450 --> 00:02:08.440
 refused by youtube and I receive an email 

00:02:06.759 --> 00:02:10.149
 saying it stays for the appetizer so 

00:02:08.440 --> 00:02:12.819
 I'm really not trying at all if it's 

00:02:10.149 --> 00:02:14.080
 the kim block 6 and youtube rockstars which 

00:02:12.819 --> 00:02:16.330
 blocks me the partner who blocks jeans 

00:02:14.080 --> 00:02:17.709
 really is worthless just we are I 

00:02:16.330 --> 00:02:19.660
 you admit that it breaks a little summer 

00:02:17.709 --> 00:02:22.110
 what did I do four videos 

00:02:19.660 --> 00:02:25.390
 these last months 1 this month 

00:02:22.110 --> 00:02:27.099
 where it's a little over eight 

00:02:25.390 --> 00:02:29.950
 hours of editing by video the swell 

00:02:27.099 --> 00:02:31.150
 when we try to clone it on youtube 

00:02:29.950 --> 00:02:33.989
 at this breaks the balls because you 

00:02:31.150 --> 00:02:36.760
 see that it does not pass therefore in hearing 

00:02:33.989 --> 00:02:37.569
 since I try to settle it is worth 

00:02:36.760 --> 00:02:39.400
 two 

00:02:37.569 --> 00:02:40.540
 I sent an email today to 

00:02:39.400 --> 00:02:42.579
 youtube to know a little bit that is 

00:02:40.540 --> 00:02:44.049
 what's going on and all that by hearing 

00:02:42.579 --> 00:02:45.310
 what I 'm going to do is that good 

00:02:44.049 --> 00:02:47.769
 do little delusions with his case 

00:02:45.310 --> 00:02:49.209
 it's the team lens on calypso all 

00:02:47.769 --> 00:02:50.799
 only where we fancy small bars 

00:02:49.209 --> 00:02:52.420
 together on various games and 

00:02:50.799 --> 00:02:54.129
 varied we will say that like that but 

00:02:52.420 --> 00:02:56.290
 especially on gto speech blur at the 

00:02:54.129 --> 00:03:00.599
 fuck too so I think I'm going 

00:02:56.290 --> 00:03:03.760
 you swing videos in not in 

00:03:00.599 --> 00:03:05.290
 in a regular activity but at 

00:03:03.760 --> 00:03:06.669
 least try to swing you a 

00:03:05.290 --> 00:03:08.650
 little video of a race what the fuck 

00:03:06.669 --> 00:03:10.239

00:03:08.650 --> 00:03:12.609
 doimo stories to say he does 

00:03:10.239 --> 00:03:14.109
 also not bad to look at and hear 

00:03:12.609 --> 00:03:15.939
 that this problem of troll mode be 

00:03:14.109 --> 00:03:18.699
 solved but I hope this video 

00:03:15.939 --> 00:03:20.260

00:03:18.699 --> 00:03:21.939
