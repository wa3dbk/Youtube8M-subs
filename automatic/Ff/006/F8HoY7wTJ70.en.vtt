that's<00:02:40.060> the<00:02:40.240> other<00:02:40.420> problem<00:02:40.720> when<00:02:41.170> fire<00:02:41.440> does

00:02:41.730 --> 00:02:41.740 
that's the other problem when fire does

that's the other problem when fire does

lines<00:02:46.740> that's<00:02:47.740> a<00:02:47.980> real<00:02:48.190> problem<00:02:48.610> because<00:02:49.300> not
