now<00:01:55.570> the<00:01:55.689> feature<00:01:55.990> here<00:01:56.289> is<00:01:56.409> we<00:01:56.530> have

00:01:56.569 --> 00:01:56.579 
now the feature here is we have

00:01:56.579 --> 00:01:58.919 
now the feature here is we have
self-centering<00:01:57.579> latches<00:01:58.149> one<00:01:58.359> on<00:01:58.479> each<00:01:58.659> side

00:01:58.919 --> 00:01:58.929 
self-centering latches one on each side

00:01:58.929 --> 00:02:01.679 
self-centering latches one on each side
this<00:01:59.200> one<00:01:59.409> on<00:01:59.530> this<00:01:59.679> one<00:02:00.090> as<00:02:01.090> well<00:02:01.270> as<00:02:01.450> over

this one on this one as well as over

00:02:01.689 --> 00:02:04.349 
this one on this one as well as over
here<00:02:01.960> and<00:02:02.920> you'll<00:02:03.460> notice<00:02:03.490> it<00:02:03.880> it<00:02:04.000> does<00:02:04.149> allow

00:02:04.349 --> 00:02:04.359 
here and you'll notice it it does allow

00:02:04.359 --> 00:02:06.270 
here and you'll notice it it does allow
it<00:02:04.390> to<00:02:04.539> move<00:02:04.630> a<00:02:04.869> little<00:02:05.049> and<00:02:05.319> that's<00:02:05.829> part<00:02:06.159> of

00:02:06.270 --> 00:02:06.280 
it to move a little and that's part of

00:02:06.280 --> 00:02:07.709 
it to move a little and that's part of
the<00:02:06.340> self<00:02:06.549> centering<00:02:06.880> so<00:02:07.149> that<00:02:07.270> when<00:02:07.390> it<00:02:07.509> comes

00:02:07.709 --> 00:02:07.719 
the self centering so that when it comes

00:02:07.719 --> 00:02:14.150 
the self centering so that when it comes
down<00:02:11.580> itself<00:02:12.580> aligns<00:02:12.879> correctly<00:02:13.480> every<00:02:13.810> time

00:02:14.150 --> 00:02:14.160 
down itself aligns correctly every time

00:02:14.160 --> 00:02:16.800 
down itself aligns correctly every time
now<00:02:15.160> you'll<00:02:15.310> notice<00:02:15.459> the<00:02:15.700> lid<00:02:15.879> here<00:02:16.180> has<00:02:16.780> a

00:03:14.789 --> 00:03:14.799 
where the lip is for this side lip

00:03:14.799 --> 00:03:17.280 
where the lip is for this side lip
you're<00:03:15.160> about<00:03:15.400> sixty<00:03:15.970> inches<00:03:16.299> or<00:03:16.630> five<00:03:16.959> plate

you're about sixty inches or five plate

00:03:17.290 --> 00:03:19.500 
you're about sixty inches or five plate
now<00:03:18.099> we<00:03:18.190> have<00:03:18.340> two<00:03:18.549> latches<00:03:18.700> here<00:03:19.120> on<00:03:19.209> the<00:03:19.299> box

00:03:19.500 --> 00:03:19.510 
now we have two latches here on the box

00:03:19.510 --> 00:03:21.720 
now we have two latches here on the box
by<00:03:20.410> pulling<00:03:20.739> the<00:03:20.829> paddle<00:03:21.160> handle<00:03:21.280> on<00:03:21.579> this

00:03:21.720 --> 00:03:21.730 
by pulling the paddle handle on this

00:03:21.730 --> 00:03:24.210 
by pulling the paddle handle on this
side<00:03:22.000> you'll<00:03:22.569> notice<00:03:22.690> this<00:03:22.989> one<00:03:23.200> moves<00:03:23.440> as

00:03:24.210 --> 00:03:24.220 
side you'll notice this one moves as

00:03:24.220 --> 00:03:26.309 
side you'll notice this one moves as
well<00:03:24.400> as<00:03:24.549> this<00:03:24.700> side<00:03:24.970> so<00:03:25.720> you<00:03:25.810> can<00:03:25.959> open<00:03:26.109> this

00:03:26.309 --> 00:03:26.319 
well as this side so you can open this

00:03:26.319 --> 00:03:28.319 
well as this side so you can open this
box<00:03:26.590> from<00:03:26.829> either<00:03:26.919> side<00:03:27.069> and<00:03:27.910> as<00:03:28.030> I<00:03:28.150> said

00:03:28.319 --> 00:03:28.329 
box from either side and as I said

00:03:28.329 --> 00:03:30.449 
box from either side and as I said
earlier<00:03:28.630> it<00:03:29.200> does<00:03:29.410> lock<00:03:29.650> but<00:03:29.919> only<00:03:30.040> on<00:03:30.220> one

00:03:30.449 --> 00:03:30.459 
earlier it does lock but only on one

00:03:30.459 --> 00:03:33.449 
earlier it does lock but only on one
side<00:03:31.139> now<00:03:32.139> before<00:03:32.410> we<00:03:32.500> install<00:03:32.530> our<00:03:32.919> box<00:03:33.130> let's

00:03:33.449 --> 00:03:33.459 
side now before we install our box let's

00:03:33.459 --> 00:03:35.159 
side now before we install our box let's
go<00:03:33.549> ahead<00:03:33.700> and<00:03:34.030> show<00:03:34.599> you<00:03:34.690> the<00:03:34.780> hardware<00:03:34.989> that
