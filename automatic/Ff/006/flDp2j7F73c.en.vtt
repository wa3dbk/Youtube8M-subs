00:01:16.080 --> 00:01:20.310
 I do not release it because I do not 

00:01:18.030 --> 00:01:22.950
 it works like I said before it's not 

00:01:20.310 --> 00:01:24.610

00:01:28.600 --> 00:01:34.120
 we connect the psp to the pc we open the 

00:01:31.390 --> 00:01:35.860

00:01:34.120 --> 00:01:38.320

00:01:35.860 --> 00:01:40.090
