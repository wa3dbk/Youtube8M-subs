condition<00:00:42.739> so<00:00:43.739> I'm<00:00:44.040> good<00:00:44.280> now<00:00:44.520> the<00:00:45.090> biggest

00:00:45.410 --> 00:00:45.420 
condition so I'm good now the biggest

00:00:45.420 --> 00:00:49.209 
condition so I'm good now the biggest
problem<00:00:45.690> with<00:00:46.079> this<00:00:46.230> case<00:00:46.610> was<00:00:47.610> revealed<00:00:48.120> and

00:00:49.209 --> 00:00:49.219 
problem with this case was revealed and

00:00:49.219 --> 00:00:51.889 
problem with this case was revealed and
that<00:00:50.219> is<00:00:50.399> the<00:00:50.610> sliding<00:00:51.059> mechanism<00:00:51.270> the

00:00:51.889 --> 00:00:51.899 
that is the sliding mechanism the

00:00:51.899 --> 00:00:55.459 
that is the sliding mechanism the
sliding<00:00:52.379> mechanism<00:00:52.559> simply<00:00:53.520> horrible<00:00:54.469> it

00:00:55.459 --> 00:00:55.469 
sliding mechanism simply horrible it

00:00:55.469 --> 00:00:58.340 
sliding mechanism simply horrible it
needs<00:00:55.829> a<00:00:56.070> lot<00:00:56.399> of<00:00:56.460> improvement<00:00:57.239> so<00:00:57.960> that<00:00:58.230> was

00:00:58.340 --> 00:00:58.350 
needs a lot of improvement so that was

00:00:58.350 --> 00:01:00.830 
needs a lot of improvement so that was
my<00:00:58.379> video<00:00:58.829> on<00:00:58.890> the<00:00:59.160> drop<00:00:59.489> test<00:00:59.760> of<00:01:00.059> the<00:01:00.239> core

00:01:00.830 --> 00:01:00.840 
my video on the drop test of the core

00:01:00.840 --> 00:01:03.740 
my video on the drop test of the core
case<00:01:01.050> i<00:01:01.320> can<00:01:02.039> show<00:01:02.280> you<00:01:02.309> to<00:01:02.640> damage<00:01:03.239> that<00:01:03.539> that

00:01:03.740 --> 00:01:03.750 
case i can show you to damage that that

00:01:03.750 --> 00:01:10.280 
case i can show you to damage that that
drop<00:01:04.110> test<00:01:04.470> did<00:01:05.220> so<00:01:06.950> the<00:01:08.150> logistic<00:01:09.150> as<00:01:09.630> you<00:01:09.840> see

00:01:10.280 --> 00:01:10.290 
drop test did so the logistic as you see

00:01:10.290 --> 00:01:14.420 
drop test did so the logistic as you see
so<00:01:11.159> the<00:01:11.610> funds<00:01:11.880> and<00:01:12.299> just<00:01:13.200> as<00:01:13.500> good

00:01:14.420 --> 00:01:14.430 
so the funds and just as good

00:01:14.430 --> 00:01:18.020 
so the funds and just as good
conditioners<00:01:15.150> is<00:01:15.470> before<00:01:16.640> might<00:01:17.640> be<00:01:17.790> a<00:01:17.820> couple

00:01:18.020 --> 00:01:18.030 
conditioners is before might be a couple

00:01:18.030 --> 00:01:25.160 
conditioners is before might be a couple
scratches<00:01:18.540> mon<00:01:22.430> on<00:01:23.430> the<00:01:23.909> plastic<00:01:24.390> but<00:01:24.659> besides

00:01:25.160 --> 00:01:25.170 
scratches mon on the plastic but besides

00:01:25.170 --> 00:01:28.580 
scratches mon on the plastic but besides
that<00:01:25.320> it's<00:01:25.680> still<00:01:26.460> fine<00:01:26.700> so<00:01:27.420> that's<00:01:28.229> the<00:01:28.350> main

00:01:28.580 --> 00:01:28.590 
that it's still fine so that's the main

00:01:28.590 --> 00:01:31.940 
that it's still fine so that's the main
part<00:01:28.909> this<00:01:29.909> does<00:01:30.240> protect<00:01:30.720> i<00:01:30.990> believe<00:01:31.920> that

00:01:31.940 --> 00:01:31.950 
part this does protect i believe that

00:01:31.950 --> 00:01:38.359 
part this does protect i believe that
was<00:01:32.369> about<00:01:32.700> I<00:01:33.060> don't<00:01:33.479> know<00:01:34.909> maybe<00:01:37.189> three<00:01:38.189> and<00:01:38.280> a

00:01:38.359 --> 00:01:38.369 
was about I don't know maybe three and a

00:01:38.369 --> 00:01:42.800 
was about I don't know maybe three and a
half<00:01:38.400> four<00:01:38.790> feet<00:01:39.500> so<00:01:40.500> maybe<00:01:41.460> 3<00:01:41.820> i'm<00:01:42.000> going<00:01:42.659> to

00:01:42.800 --> 00:01:42.810 
half four feet so maybe 3 i'm going to

00:01:42.810 --> 00:01:45.920 
half four feet so maybe 3 i'm going to
say<00:01:42.960> three<00:01:43.229> and<00:01:43.350> a<00:01:43.409> half<00:01:43.470> feet<00:01:44.689> possibly<00:01:45.689> four

00:01:45.920 --> 00:01:45.930 
say three and a half feet possibly four

00:01:45.930 --> 00:01:49.789 
say three and a half feet possibly four
I<00:01:46.140> don't<00:01:46.470> know<00:01:46.560> but<00:01:47.659> the<00:01:48.659> interior<00:01:49.470> of<00:01:49.500> the

00:01:49.789 --> 00:01:49.799 
I don't know but the interior of the

00:01:49.799 --> 00:01:54.020 
I don't know but the interior of the
case<00:01:50.040> is<00:01:50.310> fine<00:01:51.180> it's<00:01:51.979> actually<00:01:52.979> it<00:01:53.579> looks<00:01:53.790> like

00:01:54.020 --> 00:01:54.030 
case is fine it's actually it looks like

00:01:54.030 --> 00:01:56.539 
case is fine it's actually it looks like
that's<00:01:54.210> kind<00:01:54.479> of<00:01:54.570> loft<00:01:54.869> but<00:01:55.200> it<00:01:55.799> still

00:01:56.539 --> 00:01:56.549 
that's kind of loft but it still

00:01:56.549 --> 00:02:00.530 
that's kind of loft but it still
protects<00:01:57.119> the<00:01:57.840> phone<00:01:58.549> in<00:01:59.549> here<00:01:59.790> it's<00:02:00.270> fine

00:02:00.530 --> 00:02:00.540 
protects the phone in here it's fine

00:02:00.540 --> 00:02:05.090 
protects the phone in here it's fine
still<00:02:00.960> but<00:02:01.890> the<00:02:02.579> hard<00:02:03.090> class<00:02:03.329> the<00:02:03.869> hard<00:02:04.110> metal

00:02:05.090 --> 00:02:05.100 
still but the hard class the hard metal

00:02:05.100 --> 00:02:07.510 
still but the hard class the hard metal
is<00:02:05.659> now

00:02:07.510 --> 00:02:07.520 
is now

00:02:07.520 --> 00:02:09.850 
is now
and<00:02:08.000> I<00:02:08.239> think<00:02:08.509> this<00:02:08.720> a<00:02:08.780> little<00:02:09.110> bit<00:02:09.319> used<00:02:09.590> to<00:02:09.739> be

00:02:09.850 --> 00:02:09.860 
and I think this a little bit used to be

00:02:09.860 --> 00:02:12.580 
and I think this a little bit used to be
a<00:02:09.890> lot<00:02:10.129> worse<00:02:10.310> as<00:02:11.209> you<00:02:11.450> can<00:02:11.569> see<00:02:11.870> I<00:02:11.900> actually

00:02:12.580 --> 00:02:12.590 
a lot worse as you can see I actually

00:02:12.590 --> 00:02:16.740 
a lot worse as you can see I actually
covered<00:02:13.250> up<00:02:13.370> with<00:02:13.550> a<00:02:13.580> sharpie<00:02:14.150> some<00:02:15.069> scratches

00:02:16.740 --> 00:02:16.750 
covered up with a sharpie some scratches

00:02:16.750 --> 00:02:20.470 
covered up with a sharpie some scratches
there's<00:02:17.750> a<00:02:17.870> dent<00:02:18.290> it<00:02:18.739> right<00:02:19.310> there<00:02:19.670> that's

00:02:20.470 --> 00:02:20.480 
there's a dent it right there that's

00:02:20.480 --> 00:02:23.400 
there's a dent it right there that's
where<00:02:20.750> it<00:02:20.870> here<00:02:21.080> I<00:02:21.110> think<00:02:21.500> I<00:02:21.769> also<00:02:22.459> cover<00:02:22.790> that

00:02:23.400 --> 00:02:23.410 
where it here I think I also cover that

00:02:23.410 --> 00:02:26.530 
where it here I think I also cover that
so<00:02:24.410> scratches<00:02:25.310> got<00:02:25.519> there<00:02:25.730> a<00:02:25.760> little<00:02:25.910> bit<00:02:26.299> of<00:02:26.360> a

00:02:26.530 --> 00:02:26.540 
so scratches got there a little bit of a

00:02:26.540 --> 00:02:31.869 
so scratches got there a little bit of a
dent<00:02:28.030> scratches<00:02:29.030> you<00:02:29.390> know<00:02:29.650> but<00:02:30.650> the<00:02:31.129> form<00:02:31.730> of

00:02:31.869 --> 00:02:31.879 
dent scratches you know but the form of

00:02:31.879 --> 00:02:34.780 
dent scratches you know but the form of
the<00:02:32.060> case<00:02:32.239> then<00:02:32.480> got<00:02:32.959> off<00:02:33.170> this<00:02:33.830> is<00:02:34.069> now<00:02:34.220> out<00:02:34.459> a

00:02:34.780 --> 00:02:34.790 
the case then got off this is now out a

00:02:34.790 --> 00:02:36.550 
the case then got off this is now out a
little<00:02:35.030> bit<00:02:35.239> and<00:02:35.420> I<00:02:35.540> can't<00:02:35.810> bend<00:02:35.989> it<00:02:36.170> in<00:02:36.290> like

00:02:36.550 --> 00:02:36.560 
little bit and I can't bend it in like

00:02:36.560 --> 00:02:39.610 
little bit and I can't bend it in like
everything<00:02:37.549> else<00:02:37.840> and<00:02:38.840> the<00:02:39.019> camera<00:02:39.470> moves

00:02:39.610 --> 00:02:39.620 
everything else and the camera moves

00:02:39.620 --> 00:02:46.020 
everything else and the camera moves
kind<00:02:39.950> of<00:02:40.069> off<00:02:40.220> now<00:02:40.810> and<00:02:41.810> see<00:02:42.079> that<00:02:42.290> and<00:02:43.900> also

00:02:46.020 --> 00:02:46.030 
kind of off now and see that and also

00:02:46.030 --> 00:02:49.809 
kind of off now and see that and also
