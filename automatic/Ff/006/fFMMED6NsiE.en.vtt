00:03:54.540 --> 00:03:54.550 
after that's hoping that they'd be able

00:03:54.550 --> 00:03:56.550 
after that's hoping that they'd be able
to<00:03:54.760> save<00:03:54.970> some<00:03:55.150> of<00:03:55.209> this<00:03:55.360> documentation<00:03:55.959> but

00:03:56.550 --> 00:03:56.560

00:03:58.320 --> 00:03:58.330 
we were never contacted back so I hope

00:03:58.330 --> 00:04:01.770 
we were never contacted back so I hope
that<00:03:58.569> they<00:03:58.660> received<00:04:00.180> but<00:04:01.180> unfortunately

00:04:01.770 --> 00:04:01.780 
that they received but unfortunately

00:04:01.780 --> 00:04:03.360 
that they received but unfortunately
earlier<00:04:02.170> this<00:04:02.319> year<00:04:02.379> a<00:04:02.800> stadium<00:04:03.099> was

00:04:03.360 --> 00:04:03.370 
earlier this year a stadium was

00:04:03.370 --> 00:04:05.520 
earlier this year a stadium was
demolished<00:04:03.540> so<00:04:04.540> I<00:04:04.569> can<00:04:04.780> only<00:04:04.900> hope<00:04:05.170> that<00:04:05.200> the
