the entire egg you can just take out the
yolk<00:02:13.170> part<00:02:13.530> using<00:02:13.799> a<00:02:13.980> fancy<00:02:14.430> little<00:02:14.670> thing

00:02:14.899 --> 00:02:14.909 
yolk part using a fancy little thing

00:02:14.909 --> 00:02:17.899

like<00:02:15.060> this<00:02:15.329> and<00:02:15.780> it's<00:02:16.530> an<00:02:16.680> egg<00:02:16.829> separator<00:02:17.099> now

00:02:17.899 --> 00:02:17.909 
like this and it's an egg separator now

00:02:17.909 --> 00:02:20.750 
like this and it's an egg separator now
the<00:02:17.969> reason<00:02:18.480> why<00:02:18.689> I<00:02:18.989> tell<00:02:19.709> you<00:02:19.769> to<00:02:20.069> use<00:02:20.579> the

00:02:20.750 --> 00:02:20.760 
the reason why I tell you to use the

00:02:20.760 --> 00:02:23.750 
the reason why I tell you to use the
entire<00:02:20.849> egg<00:02:21.450> is<00:02:21.840> because<00:02:22.680> egg<00:02:22.920> white<00:02:23.489> is

00:02:23.750 --> 00:02:23.760 
entire egg is because egg white is

00:02:23.760 --> 00:02:25.940 
entire egg is because egg white is
simply<00:02:24.180> the<00:02:24.329> protein<00:02:24.780> of<00:02:24.930> the<00:02:24.959> egg<00:02:25.079> all<00:02:25.349> of<00:02:25.620> the

stainless steel container so it gets

00:02:58.260 --> 00:02:59.960 
stainless steel container so it gets
nice<00:02:58.470> and<00:02:58.530> fluffy<00:02:58.889> you<00:02:59.129> can<00:02:59.310> add<00:02:59.489> a<00:02:59.519> little<00:02:59.760> bit

00:02:59.960 --> 00:02:59.970
