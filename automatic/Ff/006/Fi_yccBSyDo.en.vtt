00:04:47.000 --> 00:04:47.010 
little more stable in this way you don't

00:04:47.010 --> 00:04:48.560 
little more stable in this way you don't
want<00:04:47.160> to<00:04:47.250> have<00:04:47.370> too<00:04:47.550> many<00:04:47.700> river<00:04:48.000> bands<00:04:48.300> in

00:04:48.560 --> 00:04:48.570 
want to have too many river bands in

00:04:48.570 --> 00:04:53.330 
want to have too many river bands in
there<00:04:48.950> otherwise<00:04:51.260> then<00:04:52.260> it<00:04:52.470> just<00:04:52.800> makes<00:04:52.980> it<00:04:53.100> so

00:04:53.330 --> 00:04:53.340 
there otherwise then it just makes it so

00:04:53.340 --> 00:04:56.240 
there otherwise then it just makes it so
stiff<00:04:53.820> that<00:04:54.120> it's<00:04:54.810> not<00:04:54.990> absorbing<00:04:55.800> that<00:04:56.040> much

00:04:56.240 --> 00:04:56.250 
stiff that it's not absorbing that much

00:04:56.250 --> 00:05:03.080 
stiff that it's not absorbing that much
shock<00:04:58.190> now<00:05:00.350> remember<00:05:01.350> I<00:05:01.380> cut<00:05:01.650> these<00:05:01.770> out<00:05:02.090> to

00:05:03.080 --> 00:05:03.090 
shock now remember I cut these out to

00:05:03.090 --> 00:05:07.430 
shock now remember I cut these out to
take<00:05:03.300> some<00:05:03.510> of<00:05:03.540> the<00:05:03.660> weight<00:05:03.870> off<00:05:04.340> but<00:05:05.340> you<00:05:06.440> of

take some of the weight off but you of
course<00:05:07.680> this<00:05:08.100> to<00:05:08.460> make<00:05:08.640> it<00:05:08.850> you<00:05:09.060> know<00:05:09.150> stable

00:05:09.530 --> 00:05:09.540 
course this to make it you know stable

00:05:09.540 --> 00:05:15.200 
course this to make it you know stable
you<00:05:10.140> know<00:05:10.170> this<00:05:10.500> way<00:05:10.770> and<00:05:12.590> of<00:05:13.590> course<00:05:14.210> you

00:05:15.200 --> 00:05:15.210 
you know this way and of course you

00:05:15.210 --> 00:05:17.480 
you know this way and of course you
don't<00:05:15.630> want<00:05:15.960> to<00:05:16.050> take<00:05:16.290> this<00:05:16.530> all<00:05:16.860> the<00:05:16.890> way<00:05:17.280> out

00:05:17.490 --> 00:05:19.190 
don't want to take this all the way out
to<00:05:17.670> here<00:05:17.700> because<00:05:18.150> then<00:05:18.360> these<00:05:18.540> things<00:05:18.900> come

00:05:19.190 --> 00:05:19.200 
to here because then these things come

00:05:19.200 --> 00:05:23.390 
to here because then these things come
off<00:05:19.230> and<00:05:19.800> you're<00:05:20.430> left<00:05:20.700> with<00:05:20.940> a<00:05:20.970> big<00:05:22.400> missing

00:05:23.390 --> 00:05:23.400 
off and you're left with a big missing

00:05:23.400 --> 00:05:28.900 
off and you're left with a big missing
section<00:05:23.880> there<00:05:24.120> and<00:05:24.420> over<00:05:24.690> here<00:05:24.720> so<00:05:25.350> I<00:05:27.230> left

00:05:28.900 --> 00:05:28.910 
section there and over here so I left

00:05:28.910 --> 00:05:33.440 
section there and over here so I left
quite<00:05:29.910> a<00:05:29.940> bit<00:05:30.150> on<00:05:30.300> there<00:05:30.540> just<00:05:32.150> just<00:05:33.150> to<00:05:33.270> make

00:05:33.440 --> 00:05:33.450 
quite a bit on there just just to make

00:05:33.450 --> 00:05:40.610 
quite a bit on there just just to make
it<00:05:36.770> sturdy<00:05:37.770> enough<00:05:38.750> so<00:05:39.750> it's<00:05:39.960> not<00:05:40.110> gonna<00:05:40.260> fall

00:05:40.610 --> 00:05:40.620 
it sturdy enough so it's not gonna fall

00:05:40.620 --> 00:05:45.020 
it sturdy enough so it's not gonna fall
apart<00:05:41.010> on<00:05:41.190> you<00:05:41.250> or<00:05:41.640> break<00:05:42.920> all<00:05:43.920> right<00:05:44.010> so<00:05:44.910> we

00:05:45.020 --> 00:05:45.030 
apart on you or break all right so we

00:05:45.030 --> 00:05:48.850 
apart on you or break all right so we
get<00:05:45.150> that

00:05:48.850 --> 00:05:48.860 

00:05:48.860 --> 00:05:54.490 

just<00:05:49.460> a<00:05:49.610> quick<00:05:50.030> check<00:05:53.020> this<00:05:54.020> one's<00:05:54.289> a<00:05:54.379> little

00:05:54.490 --> 00:05:54.500 
just a quick check this one's a little

00:05:54.500 --> 00:06:03.570 
just a quick check this one's a little
different

00:06:03.570 --> 00:06:03.580 

00:06:03.580 --> 00:06:09.210 

and<00:06:04.260> there<00:06:05.260> you<00:06:05.380> have<00:06:05.410> that<00:06:06.690> now<00:06:07.980> putting<00:06:08.980> this

00:06:09.210 --> 00:06:09.220 
and there you have that now putting this

00:06:09.220 --> 00:06:14.610 
and there you have that now putting this
on<00:06:09.430> the<00:06:09.540> outside<00:06:13.020> gives<00:06:14.020> you<00:06:14.140> a<00:06:14.200> little<00:06:14.470> more

00:06:14.610 --> 00:06:14.620 
on the outside gives you a little more

00:06:14.620 --> 00:06:23.120 
on the outside gives you a little more
room<00:06:16.260> to<00:06:17.260> maneuver<00:06:18.190> the<00:06:18.940> handle<00:06:20.640> because

00:06:23.120 --> 00:06:23.130 
room to maneuver the handle because

00:06:23.130 --> 00:06:28.950 
room to maneuver the handle because
remember<00:06:24.130> you're<00:06:24.280> gonna<00:06:24.370> have<00:06:27.300> fur<00:06:28.300> over<00:06:28.600> this

00:06:28.950 --> 00:06:28.960 
remember you're gonna have fur over this

00:06:28.960 --> 00:06:32.490 
remember you're gonna have fur over this
so<00:06:29.710> it<00:06:29.890> makes<00:06:30.130> it<00:06:30.340> easier<00:06:30.790> to<00:06:30.940> adjust<00:06:31.500> down

00:06:32.490 --> 00:06:32.500 
so it makes it easier to adjust down

00:06:32.500 --> 00:06:34.980 
so it makes it easier to adjust down
here<00:06:32.920> when<00:06:33.130> this<00:06:33.280> is<00:06:33.810> poking<00:06:34.810> through

00:06:34.980 --> 00:06:34.990 
here when this is poking through

00:06:34.990 --> 00:06:40.140 
here when this is poking through
slightly<00:06:36.480> now<00:06:37.480> what<00:06:37.690> we're<00:06:37.900> gonna<00:06:38.020> do<00:06:39.150> just

00:06:40.140 --> 00:06:40.150 
slightly now what we're gonna do just

00:06:40.150 --> 00:06:44.070 
slightly now what we're gonna do just
take<00:06:40.330> this<00:06:40.570> stuff<00:06:40.870> and<00:06:41.260> put<00:06:42.090> them<00:06:43.090> over<00:06:43.210> these

00:06:44.070 --> 00:06:44.080 
take this stuff and put them over these

00:06:44.080 --> 00:06:48.860 
take this stuff and put them over these
ends<00:06:44.910> of<00:06:45.910> course<00:06:46.180> first<00:06:46.540> what<00:06:46.810> I'm<00:06:46.900> gonna<00:06:47.020> do

00:06:48.860 --> 00:06:48.870 
ends of course first what I'm gonna do

00:06:48.870 --> 00:06:55.830 
ends of course first what I'm gonna do
just<00:06:49.870> kind<00:06:50.230> of<00:06:50.260> mark<00:06:52.380> at<00:06:53.380> the<00:06:53.560> outside<00:06:54.220> of<00:06:54.940> the

00:06:55.830 --> 00:06:55.840 
just kind of mark at the outside of the

00:06:55.840 --> 00:06:58.970 
just kind of mark at the outside of the
two<00:06:56.050> rings<00:06:56.440> here<00:06:56.680> the<00:06:57.580> two<00:06:57.790> coupling<00:06:58.210> pieces

00:06:58.970 --> 00:06:58.980 
two rings here the two coupling pieces

00:06:58.980 --> 00:07:06.990 
two rings here the two coupling pieces
just<00:06:59.980> so<00:07:00.100> that<00:07:00.310> I<00:07:02.340> know<00:07:03.340> not<00:07:04.210> to<00:07:05.580> put<00:07:06.580> the<00:07:06.700> wire

00:07:06.990 --> 00:07:07.000 
just so that I know not to put the wire

00:07:07.000 --> 00:07:16.469 
just so that I know not to put the wire
mesh

00:07:16.469 --> 00:07:16.479 

00:07:16.479 --> 00:07:33.850 

any<00:07:17.590> further<00:07:18.590> in<00:07:28.389> set<00:07:29.389> that<00:07:29.600> aside

00:07:33.850 --> 00:07:33.860 

00:07:33.860 --> 00:07:40.339 

now<00:07:34.860> I<00:07:34.889> took<00:07:35.249> this<00:07:35.369> off<00:07:35.610> my<00:07:35.879> other<00:07:36.029> one<00:07:36.619> and<00:07:39.349> now

00:07:40.339 --> 00:07:40.349 
now I took this off my other one and now

00:07:40.349 --> 00:07:44.059 
now I took this off my other one and now
what<00:07:40.559> I<00:07:40.589> need<00:07:40.710> to<00:07:40.860> do<00:07:41.129> is<00:07:41.929> figure<00:07:42.929> out<00:07:43.199> how<00:07:43.770> much

00:07:44.059 --> 00:07:44.069 
what I need to do is figure out how much

00:07:44.069 --> 00:07:51.109 
what I need to do is figure out how much
of<00:07:44.429> this<00:07:44.669> I<00:07:45.029> actually<00:07:45.749> need<00:07:48.589> so<00:07:50.059> when<00:07:51.059> they

00:07:51.109 --> 00:07:51.119 
of this I actually need so when they

00:07:51.119 --> 00:07:54.619 
of this I actually need so when they
need<00:07:51.300> microphone<00:07:52.169> for<00:07:52.439> that
