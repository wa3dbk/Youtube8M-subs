00:03:03.039 --> 00:03:03.049 
pretty good guys can you show us

00:03:03.049 --> 00:03:09.780

something<00:03:03.470> else

00:03:09.780 --> 00:03:09.790 

00:03:09.790 --> 00:03:12.569 

here<00:03:10.329> Universal<00:03:10.959> Studios<00:03:11.500> were<00:03:11.769> located<00:03:12.340> in

00:03:12.569 --> 00:03:12.579 
here Universal Studios were located in

00:03:12.579 --> 00:03:14.699 
here Universal Studios were located in
Southern<00:03:13.090> California<00:03:13.719> where<00:03:13.900> we<00:03:13.930> rarely<00:03:14.349> get

00:03:14.699 --> 00:03:14.709 
Southern California where we rarely get

00:03:14.709 --> 00:03:17.009 
Southern California where we rarely get
rain<00:03:15.069> so<00:03:15.700> we<00:03:15.879> have<00:03:16.060> to<00:03:16.180> create<00:03:16.390> rain<00:03:16.719> worse

00:03:17.009 --> 00:03:17.019 
rain so we have to create rain worse

00:03:17.019 --> 00:03:19.110 
rain so we have to create rain worse
that's<00:03:17.409> like<00:03:17.739> placing<00:03:18.129> sprinklers<00:03:18.670> up<00:03:18.879> above

00:03:19.110 --> 00:03:19.120 
that's like placing sprinklers up above

00:03:19.120 --> 00:03:20.970 
that's like placing sprinklers up above
the<00:03:19.390> Senate<00:03:19.689> cell<00:03:19.959> plenty<00:03:20.439> of<00:03:20.530> the<00:03:20.590> nozzles

the Senate cell plenty of the nozzles
upward<00:03:21.370> in<00:03:21.519> that<00:03:21.640> way<00:03:21.760> the<00:03:21.879> rain<00:03:22.060> falls<00:03:22.299> down

00:03:22.410 --> 00:03:22.420 
upward in that way the rain falls down

00:03:22.420 --> 00:03:31.570 
upward in that way the rain falls down
naturally

00:03:31.570 --> 00:03:31.580 

00:03:31.580 --> 00:03:33.410 

okay<00:03:32.580> though<00:03:32.790> it<00:03:32.850> sounds<00:03:33.180> like<00:03:33.300> they're

00:03:33.410 --> 00:03:33.420 
okay though it sounds like they're

00:03:33.420 --> 00:03:34.730 
okay though it sounds like they're
getting<00:03:33.510> more<00:03:33.810> water<00:03:34.050> out<00:03:34.170> there<00:03:34.470> than<00:03:34.650> they

00:03:34.730 --> 00:03:34.740 
getting more water out there than they

00:03:34.740 --> 00:03:37.010 
getting more water out there than they

00:03:40.550 --> 00:03:40.560 
simulating out here we might get some
