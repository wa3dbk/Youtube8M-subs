00:03:50.840 --> 00:03:50.850 
something to die so I could go into my

00:03:50.850 --> 00:03:53.150 
something to die so I could go into my
scarf<00:03:51.180> jirachi<00:03:51.750> and<00:03:52.200> hit<00:03:52.709> it<00:03:52.799> with<00:03:52.889> an<00:03:53.040> ice

at<00:03:55.049> this<00:03:55.200> point<00:03:55.440> so<00:03:55.680> that's<00:03:56.190> probably<00:03:56.430> why<00:03:56.639> he

00:03:56.809 --> 00:03:56.819 
at this point so that's probably why he

00:03:56.819 --> 00:03:58.879 
at this point so that's probably why he
let<00:03:57.030> his<00:03:57.269> yard<00:03:57.900> shop<00:03:58.079> in<00:03:58.260> to<00:03:58.380> die<00:03:58.590> either

let his yard shop in to die either

00:03:58.889 --> 00:04:00.770 
let his yard shop in to die either
letter<00:03:59.190> he<00:03:59.340> has<00:03:59.489> an<00:03:59.639> adamant<00:04:00.120> nature<00:04:00.209> and<00:04:00.630> not

letter he has an adamant nature and not
a<00:04:00.840> jolly<00:04:01.440> nature<00:04:01.680> so<00:04:02.190> that<00:04:02.220> allowed<00:04:02.819> me<00:04:02.850> to

00:04:03.340 --> 00:04:03.350 
a jolly nature so that allowed me to

00:04:03.350 --> 00:04:05.660 
a jolly nature so that allowed me to
expedite<00:04:04.350> in<00:04:04.590> here<00:04:04.769> because<00:04:04.859> I<00:04:05.010> really<00:04:05.430> don't

away<00:04:36.500> and<00:04:36.770> passed<00:04:37.100> away<00:04:37.330> I'm<00:04:38.330> gonna<00:04:38.480> go<00:04:38.660> and<00:04:38.810> do

00:04:38.860 --> 00:04:38.870 
away and passed away I'm gonna go and do

00:04:38.870 --> 00:04:41.800 
away and passed away I'm gonna go and do
my<00:04:38.900> Kyogre<00:04:39.680> and<00:04:39.920> now<00:04:40.400> i<00:04:40.430> believe<00:04:41.180> i<00:04:41.330> predicted

00:04:41.800 --> 00:04:41.810 
my Kyogre and now i believe i predicted

00:04:41.810 --> 00:04:43.900 
my Kyogre and now i believe i predicted
the<00:04:41.930> switz<00:04:42.170> a<00:04:42.290> change<00:04:42.530> in<00:04:42.800> one<00:04:43.070> for<00:04:43.280> the<00:04:43.370> toxic

00:04:43.900 --> 00:04:43.910 
the switz a change in one for the toxic

00:04:43.910 --> 00:04:46.390 
the switz a change in one for the toxic
did<00:04:44.480> I<00:04:44.600> predict<00:04:44.990> it<00:04:45.170> no<00:04:45.560> i<00:04:45.590> didn't<00:04:46.010> i<00:04:46.100> fell<00:04:46.370> for

00:04:46.390 --> 00:04:46.400 
did I predict it no i didn't i fell for

00:04:46.400 --> 00:04:49.120 
did I predict it no i didn't i fell for
it<00:04:46.670> again<00:04:46.700> and<00:04:47.150> i<00:04:47.420> go<00:04:47.540> for<00:04:47.690> the<00:04:47.750> ice<00:04:47.870> beam<00:04:48.170> that

00:04:49.120 --> 00:04:49.130 
it again and i go for the ice beam that

00:04:49.130 --> 00:04:51.370 
it again and i go for the ice beam that
chance<00:04:49.400> is<00:04:49.520> kind<00:04:49.790> of<00:04:49.880> dying<00:04:50.120> chances<00:04:50.930> do<00:04:51.140> take

00:04:51.370 --> 00:04:51.380 
chance is kind of dying chances do take

00:04:51.380 --> 00:04:53.500 
chance is kind of dying chances do take
a<00:04:51.410> lot<00:04:51.500> damage<00:04:52.100> from<00:04:52.250> rocks<00:04:52.520> takes<00:04:53.000> a<00:04:53.150> katy

00:04:53.500 --> 00:04:53.510 
a lot damage from rocks takes a katy

00:04:53.510 --> 00:04:56.650 
a lot damage from rocks takes a katy
damn<00:04:53.780> 80<00:04:54.110> health<00:04:54.410> from<00:04:54.590> rock<00:04:54.800> so<00:04:55.660> getting

damn 80 health from rock so getting

00:04:56.660 --> 00:04:58.090 
damn 80 health from rock so getting
those<00:04:56.870> rocks<00:04:57.170> if<00:04:57.410> i<00:04:57.500> wish<00:04:57.680> i<00:04:57.770> would<00:04:57.920> have<00:04:57.950> been

00:04:58.090 --> 00:04:58.100 
those rocks if i wish i would have been

00:04:58.100 --> 00:04:59.620 
those rocks if i wish i would have been

able to get a layer of spikes up because

00:04:59.630 --> 00:05:01.360 
able to get a layer of spikes up because
that<00:04:59.810> would<00:04:59.900> have<00:04:59.990> really<00:05:00.380> screwed<00:05:01.070> his

00:05:01.360 --> 00:05:01.370 
that would have really screwed his

00:05:01.370 --> 00:05:03.310 
that would have really screwed his
chancing<00:05:01.790> survivability<00:05:02.300> over<00:05:02.810> but<00:05:03.170> he's

chancing survivability over but he's

00:05:03.320 --> 00:05:04.750 
chancing survivability over but he's
going<00:05:03.440> to<00:05:03.500> predict<00:05:03.890> a<00:05:04.010> switch<00:05:04.220> and<00:05:04.460> go<00:05:04.580> for

00:05:04.750 --> 00:05:04.760 
going to predict a switch and go for

00:05:04.760 --> 00:05:07.120 
going to predict a switch and go for
that<00:05:04.880> soft<00:05:05.240> boiled<00:05:05.780> and<00:05:05.990> that's<00:05:06.710> really

00:05:07.120 --> 00:05:07.130 
that soft boiled and that's really

00:05:07.130 --> 00:05:08.680 
that soft boiled and that's really
unfortunate<00:05:07.490> because<00:05:07.790> now<00:05:08.060> this<00:05:08.180> chance<00:05:08.450> he's

00:05:08.680 --> 00:05:08.690 
unfortunate because now this chance he's

00:05:08.690 --> 00:05:11.230 
unfortunate because now this chance he's

just going to go for earthquake I know
it's<00:05:20.420> going<00:05:20.600> to<00:05:20.720> be<00:05:20.810> able<00:05:20.930> to<00:05:21.110> take<00:05:21.290> out<00:05:21.590> that<00:05:21.860> d

00:05:22.150 --> 00:05:22.160 
it's going to be able to take out that d

00:05:22.160 --> 00:05:24.760 
it's going to be able to take out that d
axis<00:05:22.340> attack<00:05:22.940> and<00:05:23.240> if<00:05:23.660> the<00:05:24.050> chance<00:05:24.320> he<00:05:24.440> wanted

00:05:27.250 --> 00:05:27.260 
to switch into his dialga i could go for

00:05:27.260 --> 00:05:28.930 
to switch into his dialga i could go for
earthquake<00:05:28.040> that<00:05:28.070> would<00:05:28.340> be<00:05:28.430> super<00:05:28.580> effective

00:05:28.930 --> 00:05:28.940 
earthquake that would be super effective

00:05:28.940 --> 00:05:30.670 
earthquake that would be super effective
and<00:05:29.210> i<00:05:29.270> didn't<00:05:29.510> want<00:05:29.570> to<00:05:29.720> go<00:05:29.810> for<00:05:30.020> a<00:05:30.230> jet<00:05:30.470> I<00:05:30.620> know

00:05:30.670 --> 00:05:30.680 
and i didn't want to go for a jet I know

00:05:30.680 --> 00:05:32.410 
and i didn't want to go for a jet I know
it's<00:05:31.070> my<00:05:31.220> strongest<00:05:31.640> move<00:05:31.880> that<00:05:32.120> I<00:05:32.150> can<00:05:32.330> have

00:05:32.410 --> 00:05:32.420 
it's my strongest move that I can have

00:05:32.420 --> 00:05:34.240 
it's my strongest move that I can have
this<00:05:32.540> chancy<00:05:32.930> with<00:05:33.110> I<00:05:33.320> just<00:05:33.860> didn't<00:05:34.070> want<00:05:34.190> to

00:05:34.240 --> 00:05:34.250 
this chancy with I just didn't want to

00:05:34.250 --> 00:05:35.890 
this chancy with I just didn't want to
go<00:05:34.400> for<00:05:34.610> it<00:05:34.640> and<00:05:34.880> now<00:05:34.970> I'm<00:05:35.330> just<00:05:35.390> going<00:05:35.510> to<00:05:35.630> stay

00:05:35.890 --> 00:05:35.900 
go for it and now I'm just going to stay

00:05:35.900 --> 00:05:37.870 
go for it and now I'm just going to stay
in<00:05:35.930> seeing<00:05:36.710> how<00:05:36.800> much<00:05:37.070> it's<00:05:37.310> going<00:05:37.430> to<00:05:37.490> do<00:05:37.700> the

00:05:37.870 --> 00:05:37.880 
in seeing how much it's going to do the

00:05:37.880 --> 00:05:40.030 
in seeing how much it's going to do the
chance<00:05:38.180> and<00:05:38.330> that<00:05:38.660> does<00:05:38.930> a<00:05:38.960> quite<00:05:39.680> a<00:05:39.710> good

00:05:40.030 --> 00:05:40.040 
chance and that does a quite a good

00:05:40.040 --> 00:05:41.920 
chance and that does a quite a good
chunk<00:05:40.370> to<00:05:40.550> it<00:05:40.700> but<00:05:41.300> he's<00:05:41.450> just<00:05:41.600> going<00:05:41.720> to<00:05:41.840> go

00:05:41.920 --> 00:05:41.930 
chunk to it but he's just going to go

00:05:41.930 --> 00:05:44.860 
chunk to it but he's just going to go
for<00:05:42.380> the<00:05:42.410> toxic<00:05:42.980> to<00:05:43.490> screw<00:05:44.000> my<00:05:44.240> survivability

00:05:44.860 --> 00:05:44.870 
for the toxic to screw my survivability

00:05:44.870 --> 00:05:47.470 
for the toxic to screw my survivability
over<00:05:45.470> and<00:05:45.680> honestly<00:05:46.400> I<00:05:46.670> shouldn't<00:05:47.180> have<00:05:47.270> let

00:05:47.470 --> 00:05:47.480 
over and honestly I shouldn't have let

00:05:47.480 --> 00:05:49.390 
over and honestly I shouldn't have let
the<00:05:47.600> same<00:05:47.840> toxin<00:05:48.380> got<00:05:48.590> poisoned<00:05:49.100> I<00:05:49.220> should

00:05:49.390 --> 00:05:49.400 
the same toxin got poisoned I should

00:05:49.400 --> 00:05:51.490 
the same toxin got poisoned I should
have<00:05:49.460> switched<00:05:49.580> them<00:05:49.820> Kyogre<00:05:50.500> predicting

00:05:51.490 --> 00:05:51.500 
have switched them Kyogre predicting

00:05:51.500 --> 00:05:53.110 
have switched them Kyogre predicting
that<00:05:51.620> but<00:05:51.830> it<00:05:51.950> does<00:05:52.160> a<00:05:52.190> good<00:05:52.430> chunk<00:05:52.700> and<00:05:52.940> it

00:05:53.110 --> 00:05:53.120 
that but it does a good chunk and it

00:05:53.120 --> 00:05:55.000 
that but it does a good chunk and it
doesn't<00:05:53.510> take<00:05:53.690> out<00:05:53.900> the<00:05:54.020> chance<00:05:54.350> and<00:05:54.650> he<00:05:54.830> goes

00:05:55.000 --> 00:05:55.010 
doesn't take out the chance and he goes

00:05:55.010 --> 00:05:56.980 
doesn't take out the chance and he goes
through<00:05:55.190> the<00:05:55.280> soft<00:05:55.490> boil<00:05:55.790> again<00:05:55.970> I'm<00:05:56.240> like<00:05:56.420> all

00:05:56.980 --> 00:05:56.990 
through the soft boil again I'm like all

00:05:56.990 --> 00:05:59.260 
through the soft boil again I'm like all
right<00:05:57.020> I<00:05:57.170> can't<00:05:57.500> stay<00:05:57.770> in<00:05:57.800> here<00:05:58.010> any<00:05:58.310> longer<00:05:58.850> I

00:05:59.260 --> 00:05:59.270 
right I can't stay in here any longer I

00:05:59.270 --> 00:06:01.630 
right I can't stay in here any longer I
mean<00:05:59.810> maybe<00:06:00.050> one<00:06:00.470> more<00:06:00.650> turn<00:06:00.890> just<00:06:01.130> see<00:06:01.400> if<00:06:01.550> I

00:06:01.630 --> 00:06:01.640 
mean maybe one more turn just see if I

00:06:01.640 --> 00:06:03.820 
mean maybe one more turn just see if I
can<00:06:01.820> get<00:06:01.910> the<00:06:02.090> max<00:06:02.330> damage<00:06:02.570> to<00:06:02.870> take<00:06:03.080> it<00:06:03.230> out<00:06:03.380> or

00:06:03.820 --> 00:06:03.830 
can get the max damage to take it out or

00:06:03.830 --> 00:06:06.010 
can get the max damage to take it out or
maybe<00:06:04.220> I'll<00:06:04.460> get<00:06:04.610> a<00:06:04.670> critical<00:06:05.180> hit<00:06:05.330> but<00:06:05.930> I

00:06:06.010 --> 00:06:06.020
