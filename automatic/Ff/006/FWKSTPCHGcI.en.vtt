just<00:02:30.460> quite<00:02:30.760> yet<00:02:30.790> I<00:02:31.120> mean<00:02:31.300> I<00:02:31.330> have<00:02:31.540> got<00:02:31.690> a

00:02:31.710 --> 00:02:31.720 
just quite yet I mean I have got a

00:02:31.720 --> 00:02:33.300 
just quite yet I mean I have got a
penalty<00:02:31.990> after<00:02:32.470> that<00:02:32.620> final<00:02:32.980> sector

penalty after that final sector

00:02:33.310 --> 00:02:35.490 
penalty after that final sector
collision<00:02:33.730> so<00:02:33.940> it<00:02:34.360> would<00:02:34.510> be<00:02:34.660> unlikely<00:02:34.990> for<00:02:35.410> me

00:02:35.490 --> 00:02:35.500 
collision so it would be unlikely for me

00:02:35.500 --> 00:02:37.380 
collision so it would be unlikely for me

00:02:37.380 --> 00:02:37.390 
to win the lobby but who knows you know

00:02:37.390 --> 00:02:39.540 
to win the lobby but who knows you know
I<00:02:37.420> could<00:02:37.660> have<00:02:37.750> them<00:02:37.990> so<00:02:38.290> knows<00:02:38.830> one<00:02:39.310> of<00:02:39.340> them

00:02:39.540 --> 00:02:39.550 
I could have them so knows one of them

00:03:24.610 --> 00:03:26.250 
which isn't happening as he drives away
from<00:03:24.970> me<00:03:25.120> as<00:03:25.240> we<00:03:25.360> go<00:03:25.480> towards<00:03:25.810> the<00:03:25.870> swimming

that's the next big opportunity to get a
move<00:03:36.070> done<00:03:36.310> here<00:03:36.520> so<00:03:36.640> I<00:03:36.700> need<00:03:36.880> to<00:03:36.970> take<00:03:37.150> a<00:03:37.180> nice

00:03:51.240 --> 00:03:51.250 
frustrating as we go through turn one

00:03:51.250 --> 00:03:53.130 
frustrating as we go through turn one
now<00:03:51.520> and<00:03:51.610> we<00:03:51.700> both<00:03:51.940> hit<00:03:52.180> the<00:03:52.330> wall<00:03:52.600> there<00:03:52.930> he

00:03:53.130 --> 00:03:53.140 
now and we both hit the wall there he

00:03:53.140 --> 00:03:54.300 
now and we both hit the wall there he
got<00:03:53.320> really<00:03:53.590> out<00:03:53.830> of<00:03:53.860> shape

00:03:54.300 --> 00:03:54.310 
got really out of shape

00:03:54.310 --> 00:03:56.400 
got really out of shape
but<00:03:55.060> I<00:03:55.390> haven't<00:03:55.720> managed<00:03:56.020> to<00:03:56.050> get<00:03:56.170> the<00:03:56.260> move

00:03:56.400 --> 00:03:56.410 
but I haven't managed to get the move

00:03:56.410 --> 00:03:57.570 
but I haven't managed to get the move
done<00:03:56.590> there<00:03:56.800> so<00:03:56.950> I<00:03:57.010> don't<00:03:57.160> know<00:03:57.280> if<00:03:57.340> I'm<00:03:57.430> going

00:03:57.570 --> 00:03:57.580 
done there so I don't know if I'm going

00:03:58.949 --> 00:03:58.959 
to get the move done at all here I mean

00:03:58.959 --> 00:04:00.900 
to get the move done at all here I mean
it's<00:03:59.080> just<00:03:59.290> impossible<00:03:59.590> but<00:04:00.220> we<00:04:00.370> have<00:04:00.550> gained

00:04:00.900 --> 00:04:00.910
