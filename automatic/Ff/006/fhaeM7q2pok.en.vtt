 questions of flying to the moon or of course 

00:00:36.870 --> 00:00:40.110
 don't really remember what 

00:00:38.160 --> 00:00:42.090

00:01:31.170 --> 00:01:34.909
 Russian engineers 

00:01:32.340 --> 00:01:37.799
 because first thing first thing there 

00:01:34.909 --> 00:01:39.630
 the land question and arose where hid

00:01:39.630 --> 00:01:44.100
 soil that brought Americans 

00:01:41.640 --> 00:01:45.390
 According to NASA's 69 for '72 on the ground with

 do not really prove and after a year others 

00:02:00.719 --> 00:02:03.689
 wait for scientific lost areas 

00:02:02.369 --> 00:02:05.880
 the appearance of some important 

00:02:03.689 --> 00:02:09.899
