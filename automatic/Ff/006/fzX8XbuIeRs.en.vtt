00:00:22.840 --> 00:00:26.990
 I do not know how holding that I 

00:00:25.340 --> 00:00:28.910

00:00:26.990 --> 00:00:31.279
 if you see me finally if you 

00:00:28.910 --> 00:00:31.730
 hear that my voice is a little bit 

00:00:31.279 --> 00:00:34.070
 weird 

00:00:31.730 --> 00:00:37.309
 sometimes she goes to baths and 

00:00:34.070 --> 00:00:39.230
 becomes very serious to others more than 

00:00:37.309 --> 00:00:40.230
 usually it's just because 

00:00:39.230 --> 00:00:42.660
 that I 

00:00:40.230 --> 00:00:44.760
 I'm sick somehow the g 

00:00:42.660 --> 00:00:46.910
 finally I do not have if I have angina or 

00:00:44.760 --> 00:00:52.260
 other but well so much 

00:00:46.910 --> 00:00:54.780
 let's look at the forgiveness modes so 

00:00:52.260 --> 00:00:56.160
 where fashion you need fashion audard you 

00:00:54.780 --> 00:00:58.320
 can download all this on minecraft 

00:00:56.160 --> 00:01:00.410
 point fr I 'm just going to remove the are 

00:00:58.320 --> 00:01:04.530
 because it's very annoying 

00:01:00.410 --> 00:01:07.350
 here is on minecraft the host goes back to 

00:01:04.530 --> 00:01:09.210
 gala.fr you download fashion the smell 

00:01:07.350 --> 00:01:11.970
 is at 2 27 

00:01:09.210 --> 00:01:13.770
 a hall and the links are in the 

00:01:11.970 --> 00:01:19.130
 description as usual do not hesitate 

00:01:13.770 --> 00:01:21.300
 not to click to download next 

00:01:19.130 --> 00:01:23.970
 once you have installed the mode 

00:01:21.300 --> 00:01:25.170
 and you go on your party and he will 

00:01:23.970 --> 00:01:27.149
 just click on h 

00:01:25.170 --> 00:01:30.690
 if the default key is that you 

00:01:27.149 --> 00:01:32.610
 open its so this mode allows you to 

00:01:30.690 --> 00:01:34.320
 change the full location of 

00:01:32.610 --> 00:01:36.630
 things as well as many other things 

00:01:34.320 --> 00:01:38.190
 but what is most interesting 

00:01:36.630 --> 00:01:40.830
 it's to change things there so the 

00:01:38.190 --> 00:01:41.850
 rest have a little bit put aside I 

00:01:40.830 --> 00:01:44.250
 also leaves you a little discover 

00:01:41.850 --> 00:01:47.280
 some things is changed by 

00:01:44.250 --> 00:01:48.780
 example the life bar look from the 

00:01:47.280 --> 00:01:50.250
 bar of life in babouches in the process of 

00:01:48.780 --> 00:01:52.500
 show with my fingers we do not see 

00:01:50.250 --> 00:01:54.509
 kept calling him on double he reminded 

00:01:52.500 --> 00:01:56.489
 in normal times because the pool mirror 

00:01:54.509 --> 00:01:59.190
 room but the other way what you 

00:01:56.489 --> 00:02:02.819
 makes a nice effect in vertical well 

00:01:59.190 --> 00:02:05.940
 obviously and of course that I did not 

00:02:02.819 --> 00:02:08.970
 still not understood so 100 of the assets 

00:02:05.940 --> 00:02:11.009
 that too you can obviously 

00:02:08.970 --> 00:02:12.900
 take it and keep it at the if you 

00:02:11.009 --> 00:02:16.580
 would like to stay there and the master really 

00:02:12.900 --> 00:02:21.270
 anywhere the now you change 

00:02:16.580 --> 00:02:23.220
 your armor mount fuji no armor nasa 

00:02:21.270 --> 00:02:26.390
 will not be personally I would have put 

00:02:23.220 --> 00:02:28.860
 rather there down then bac 

00:02:26.390 --> 00:02:34.230
 this is for breathing under 

00:02:28.860 --> 00:02:37.860
 water for example was waiting for no 

00:02:34.230 --> 00:02:42.170
 these are the constitutions in vertical 

00:02:37.860 --> 00:02:49.940
 here you can put it for example 

00:02:42.170 --> 00:02:55.370
 rather here like this and suddenly there if I 

00:02:49.940 --> 00:02:56.330
 go in the water calais the bubbles 

00:02:55.370 --> 00:02:58.340
 start from 

00:02:56.330 --> 00:03:01.220
 and if I come back but more they come 

00:02:58.340 --> 00:03:03.319
 in which it is really not bad you 

00:03:01.220 --> 00:03:07.959
 can modify your beauf bar 1 

00:03:03.319 --> 00:03:12.290
 just like the hearts and the the 

00:03:07.959 --> 00:03:15.950
 also the bar items so this is 

00:03:12.290 --> 00:03:18.560
 the bar of items you can do in 

00:03:15.950 --> 00:03:22.100
 kind of put it in vertical 

00:03:18.560 --> 00:03:23.269
 horizontal the normal vertical I like 

00:03:22.100 --> 00:03:27.470
 a lot because we can for example 

00:03:23.269 --> 00:03:32.180
 put there and suddenly it gives something 

00:03:27.470 --> 00:03:37.040
 nice enough it's really not bad h 

00:03:32.180 --> 00:03:39.890
 the xb hit bar it's a little bit 

00:03:37.040 --> 00:03:43.819
 more weird we can not the 

00:03:39.890 --> 00:03:46.640
 put vertically 

00:03:43.819 --> 00:03:48.500
 so you know that's a little bit 

00:03:46.640 --> 00:03:52.209
 pity but hey we got it but down there 

00:03:48.500 --> 00:03:55.370
 it's not very disturbing bac 

00:03:52.209 --> 00:03:57.530
 here it is for the flights the cat by 

00:03:55.370 --> 00:03:58.880
 example you normally and normally 

00:03:57.530 --> 00:04:02.690
 bottom left you want to put it in 

00:03:58.880 --> 00:04:05.450
 top right you put it tray and that 

00:04:02.690 --> 00:04:09.410
 appears at the top right then the 

00:04:05.450 --> 00:04:11.480
 Croatian air so that's the little thing you 

00:04:09.410 --> 00:04:14.209
 do you like that select 

00:04:11.480 --> 00:04:17.479
 that you want I do not know for example 

00:04:14.209 --> 00:04:23.720
 the creeper and suddenly you have a cry 

00:04:17.479 --> 00:04:25.940
 scared or such club ccc does not hurt the 

00:04:23.720 --> 00:04:28.669
 crosshair the bump the life of the boss of 

00:04:25.940 --> 00:04:30.350
 bumps it does not interest you that no 

00:04:28.669 --> 00:04:33.020
 more and that either so we did a 

00:04:30.350 --> 00:04:35.450
 little bit around the most things 

00:04:33.020 --> 00:04:37.700
 important somehow and again 

00:04:35.450 --> 00:04:39.410
 some interesting things 

00:04:37.700 --> 00:04:41.840
 I will let you discover by yourself 

00:04:39.410 --> 00:04:42.639
 even good there we can see it's a small 

00:04:41.840 --> 00:04:44.229
 little 

00:04:42.639 --> 00:04:46.300
 the bazaar how did I put things 

00:04:44.229 --> 00:04:48.060
 but you can really put them 

00:04:46.300 --> 00:04:52.960
 very very well for example the left 

00:04:48.060 --> 00:04:57.849
 put all that is life and food and 

00:04:52.960 --> 00:04:58.389
 air in the air you're under water and at 

00:04:57.849 --> 00:05:00.639
 right 

00:04:58.389 --> 00:05:02.919
 xp and that's so it's really it's a 

00:05:00.639 --> 00:05:03.460
 very good fashion so here I hope it 

00:05:02.919 --> 00:05:05.409
