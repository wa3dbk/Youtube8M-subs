00:02:38.840 --> 00:02:38.850 
some people who decided that it was

00:02:38.850 --> 00:02:40.670 
some people who decided that it was
going<00:02:39.120> to<00:02:39.150> be<00:02:39.360> that<00:02:39.510> way<00:02:39.720> but<00:02:39.959> it's<00:02:40.110> not<00:02:40.350> at<00:02:40.500> all

00:02:40.670 --> 00:02:40.680 
going to be that way but it's not at all

00:02:40.680 --> 00:02:43.250 
going to be that way but it's not at all
what<00:02:41.370> the<00:02:42.000> possibilities<00:02:42.360> are<00:02:42.630> of<00:02:42.900> the<00:02:43.020> human

00:02:43.250 --> 00:02:43.260 
what the possibilities are of the human

00:02:43.260 --> 00:02:45.710 
what the possibilities are of the human
voice<00:02:43.290> we<00:02:43.740> can<00:02:43.950> sing<00:02:44.459> whatever<00:02:44.610> you<00:02:44.880> want<00:02:45.240> if

00:02:45.710 --> 00:02:45.720 
voice we can sing whatever you want if

00:02:45.720 --> 00:02:49.310 
voice we can sing whatever you want if
we<00:02:45.990> apply<00:02:46.350> the<00:02:46.920> correct<00:02:47.280> technique<00:02:48.140> you<00:02:49.140> can

00:02:49.310 --> 00:02:49.320 
we apply the correct technique you can

00:02:49.320 --> 00:02:50.810 
we apply the correct technique you can
at<00:02:49.410> least<00:02:49.650> sing<00:02:49.920> three<00:02:50.280> octaves

00:02:50.810 --> 00:02:50.820 
at least sing three octaves

I<00:02:53.900> think<00:02:54.900> emergency<00:02:55.500> aid<00:02:55.620> is<00:02:55.890> unique<00:02:56.580> in<00:02:56.970> a

00:02:57.140 --> 00:02:57.150 
I think emergency aid is unique in a

00:02:57.150 --> 00:03:01.940 
I think emergency aid is unique in a
sense<00:02:57.180> that<00:02:57.870> before<00:02:58.620> I<00:02:59.370> entered<00:03:00.120> CVI<00:03:00.510> I<00:03:01.380> had

00:03:01.940 --> 00:03:01.950 
sense that before I entered CVI I had

00:03:01.950 --> 00:03:03.610 
sense that before I entered CVI I had
never<00:03:02.280> heard<00:03:02.550> of<00:03:02.670> it<00:03:02.790> before

00:03:03.610 --> 00:03:03.620 
never heard of it before

00:03:03.620 --> 00:03:06.500 
never heard of it before
what<00:03:04.620> happened<00:03:05.010> very<00:03:05.130> often<00:03:05.430> is<00:03:05.880> that<00:03:06.239> when<00:03:06.480> I

00:03:06.500 --> 00:03:06.510 
what happened very often is that when I

00:03:06.510 --> 00:03:09.290 
what happened very often is that when I
was<00:03:06.870> having<00:03:07.050> a<00:03:07.260> voice<00:03:07.440> problem<00:03:07.950> I<00:03:08.489> just<00:03:09.120> had<00:03:09.209> to

00:03:09.290 --> 00:03:09.300 
was having a voice problem I just had to

00:03:09.300 --> 00:03:11.690 
was having a voice problem I just had to
cancel<00:03:09.510> a<00:03:09.720> concert<00:03:09.900> which<00:03:10.860> sometimes<00:03:11.370> is<00:03:11.519> very

00:03:11.690 --> 00:03:11.700 
cancel a concert which sometimes is very

00:03:11.700 --> 00:03:13.040 
cancel a concert which sometimes is very
difficult<00:03:12.060> because<00:03:12.239> when<00:03:12.570> you<00:03:12.660> have<00:03:12.720> signed

00:03:13.040 --> 00:03:13.050 
difficult because when you have signed

00:03:13.050 --> 00:03:14.570 
difficult because when you have signed
contracts<00:03:13.560> and<00:03:13.709> all<00:03:13.800> that<00:03:13.950> it<00:03:14.100> can<00:03:14.250> be<00:03:14.370> really

00:03:14.570 --> 00:03:14.580 
contracts and all that it can be really

00:03:14.580 --> 00:03:18.020 
contracts and all that it can be really
hustle<00:03:15.090> and<00:03:15.600> today<00:03:16.560> that<00:03:16.860> is<00:03:16.890> not<00:03:17.190> that<00:03:17.850> it's

00:03:18.020 --> 00:03:18.030 
hustle and today that is not that it's

00:03:18.030 --> 00:03:20.570 
hustle and today that is not that it's
not<00:03:18.590> necessary<00:03:19.590> anymore<00:03:19.769> because<00:03:20.310> if<00:03:20.459> you

00:03:34.699 --> 00:03:34.709 
I've never heard of any other a school

00:03:34.709 --> 00:03:37.250 
I've never heard of any other a school
of<00:03:34.980> thought<00:03:35.040> I<00:03:35.610> mean<00:03:35.790> in<00:03:35.940> voice<00:03:36.150> education<00:03:37.049> or

00:03:37.250 --> 00:03:37.260 
of thought I mean in voice education or

00:03:37.260 --> 00:03:39.680 
of thought I mean in voice education or
technique<00:03:37.890> that<00:03:38.580> has<00:03:38.880> a<00:03:38.970> program<00:03:39.450> like<00:03:39.630> that

00:03:39.680 --> 00:03:39.690 
technique that has a program like that

00:03:39.690 --> 00:03:41.539 
technique that has a program like that
correct<00:03:40.320> me<00:03:40.470> if<00:03:40.620> I'm<00:03:40.739> wrong<00:03:40.769> but<00:03:41.190> I'm<00:03:41.400> not

00:03:41.539 --> 00:03:41.549 
correct me if I'm wrong but I'm not

00:03:41.549 --> 00:03:43.880 
correct me if I'm wrong but I'm not
aware<00:03:41.820> of<00:03:41.880> it<00:03:42.180> and<00:03:42.360> I<00:03:42.480> think<00:03:42.780> it's<00:03:42.959> one<00:03:43.620> of<00:03:43.650> the

00:03:43.880 --> 00:03:43.890 
aware of it and I think it's one of the

00:03:43.890 --> 00:03:46.100 
aware of it and I think it's one of the
things<00:03:44.130> that<00:03:44.310> really<00:03:44.489> makes<00:03:44.880> CVT<00:03:45.780> really

00:03:46.100 --> 00:03:46.110 
things that really makes CVT really

00:03:46.110 --> 00:04:04.560 
things that really makes CVT really
special

00:04:04.560 --> 00:04:04.570 

00:04:04.570 --> 00:04:10.360 

it's<00:04:05.570> very<00:04:05.750> nice<00:04:06.020> to<00:04:08.770> experiment<00:04:09.770> with<00:04:10.130> your

00:04:10.360 --> 00:04:10.370 
it's very nice to experiment with your

00:04:10.370 --> 00:04:12.100 
it's very nice to experiment with your
