00:00:01.879 --> 00:00:10.019
 good 

00:00:04.130 --> 00:00:12.030
 james good morning friends welcome to 

00:00:10.019 --> 00:00:15.360
 wasl steiner punto tve I'm Juan Carlos 

00:00:12.030 --> 00:00:17.880
 meneses and I want to analyze quickly 

00:00:15.360 --> 00:00:21.060
 a little in the environment in which we live 

00:00:17.880 --> 00:00:23.910
 and vice for example a supermarket we 

00:00:21.060 --> 00:00:27.900
 they are flooding everything that is 

00:00:23.910 --> 00:00:29.530
 fat- free diet products with 

00:00:27.900 --> 00:00:33.630
 sugar 

00:00:29.530 --> 00:00:36.850
 millions of messages in many cases 

00:00:33.630 --> 00:00:38.190
 possibly qualified as advertising 

00:00:36.850 --> 00:00:40.260
 deceptive 

00:00:38.190 --> 00:00:43.320
 really if you look at the composition 

00:00:40.260 --> 00:00:45.360
 nutritional in 100 grams what is 

00:00:43.320 --> 00:00:47.990
 fat free 

00:00:45.360 --> 00:00:50.460
 a lot of sugar because somehow 

00:00:47.990 --> 00:00:52.560
 they replace the flavor intensities 

00:00:50.460 --> 00:00:55.110
 consistency and so on with another kind of 

00:00:52.560 --> 00:00:57.900
 elements therefore what you take away for 

00:00:55.110 --> 00:01:00.810
 one side do it for another and I can say 

00:00:57.900 --> 00:01:03.270
 which is more dangerous in those who are more 

00:01:00.810 --> 00:01:05.040
 dangerous foods rich in sugar 

00:01:03.270 --> 00:01:08.010
 that high-fat foods 

00:01:05.040 --> 00:01:10.920
 both are bad but within the bad 

00:01:08.010 --> 00:01:12.680
 the worst are the foods rich in 

00:01:10.920 --> 00:01:16.170
 sugar because they are not usually 

00:01:12.680 --> 00:01:18.390
 sugars of slow assimilation as you can 

00:01:16.170 --> 00:01:21.020
 be the brown rice the spelled bread 

00:01:18.390 --> 00:01:22.979
 that we assimilate them our body 

00:01:21.020 --> 00:01:24.930
 gradually until they become 

00:01:22.979 --> 00:01:26.640
 glucose has some glycemic indexes 

00:01:24.930 --> 00:01:30.180
 we have other videos when we talk 

00:01:26.640 --> 00:01:31.770
 about the low glycemic index and so 

00:01:30.180 --> 00:01:33.600
 So much our body does not make it 

00:01:31.770 --> 00:01:36.330
 quickly into glucose so it does not 

00:01:33.600 --> 00:01:38.610
 shoots insulin and starts that 

00:01:36.330 --> 00:01:41.790
 vicious circle of accumulation of 

00:01:38.610 --> 00:01:43.140
 fat and also that way to the 

00:01:41.790 --> 00:01:44.980
 type 2 diabetes 

00:01:43.140 --> 00:01:48.520
 so 

00:01:44.980 --> 00:01:50.470
 all this food today from 

00:01:48.520 --> 00:01:54.480
 yoghurts 

00:01:50.470 --> 00:01:57.100
 well packaged cereals and so on 

00:01:54.480 --> 00:02:00.370
 they have a tremendous amount of sugar 

00:01:57.100 --> 00:02:04.390
 therefore they are foods between 

00:02:00.370 --> 00:02:06.520
 quotes really bad foods that 

00:02:04.390 --> 00:02:08.679
 ought you certainly do not 

00:02:06.520 --> 00:02:11.680
 put them and especially we told 

00:02:08.679 --> 00:02:13.360
 your children just like the cookies what 

00:02:11.680 --> 00:02:16.420
 only they do is favor the 

00:02:13.360 --> 00:02:18.010
 accumulation of fat evidently from 

00:02:16.420 --> 00:02:22.180
 our children are in a period of 

00:02:18.010 --> 00:02:25.090
 growth development and assimilate it 

00:02:22.180 --> 00:02:26.860
 many of them assimilate it quickly 

00:02:25.090 --> 00:02:29.740
 they burn it because if they are very children 

00:02:26.860 --> 00:02:34.030
 assets as they burn from multiple crowd 

00:02:29.740 --> 00:02:36.100
 of calories but we also see a part 

00:02:34.030 --> 00:02:37.930
 important of children today in with 

00:02:36.100 --> 00:02:40.830
 childhood obesity and this must be 

00:02:37.930 --> 00:02:44.380
 mainly to that bad diet 

00:02:40.830 --> 00:02:45.730
 although your son has the habit 

00:02:44.380 --> 00:02:47.920
 of the alien are you 

00:02:45.730 --> 00:02:50.230
 inculcating eating that kind of 

00:02:47.920 --> 00:02:51.760
 food completely wrong and if 

00:02:50.230 --> 00:02:54.310
 keep that habit as it goes 

00:02:51.760 --> 00:02:57.250
 developing and growing increases those 

00:02:54.310 --> 00:02:59.500
 amounts of junk food all 

00:02:57.250 --> 00:03:02.140
 days, the most normal thing is that when 

00:02:59.500 --> 00:03:05.439
 be teenagers have obesity and 

00:03:02.140 --> 00:03:09.159
 then he has a serious problem because 

00:03:05.439 --> 00:03:11.950
 you have a child who has made little to 

00:03:09.159 --> 00:03:14.620
 little unhealthy habits since childhood 

00:03:11.950 --> 00:03:16.840
 and maybe when he will be fourteen years old 

00:03:14.620 --> 00:03:19.840
 for almost ten years out 

00:03:16.840 --> 00:03:21.670
 of really using reason or the 11 

00:03:19.840 --> 00:03:24.940
 years of use of reason totally 

00:03:21.670 --> 00:03:28.150
 aware of what the bears 

00:03:24.940 --> 00:03:30.549
 He has been building unhealthy habits 

00:03:28.150 --> 00:03:32.560
 so it's going to be quite complicated to 

00:03:30.549 --> 00:03:35.379
 reverse that process and we will have a 

00:03:32.560 --> 00:03:37.629
 serious problem between hands then I 

00:03:35.379 --> 00:03:41.639
 I advise you to cut all this type of 

00:03:37.629 --> 00:03:44.230
 food and try to instill the fruit 

00:03:41.639 --> 00:03:46.750
 the vegetables 

00:03:44.230 --> 00:03:49.750
 also obviously but especially the 

00:03:46.750 --> 00:03:51.760
 fruit try also if you give it madness 

00:03:49.750 --> 00:03:55.390
 is that it is as far as possible 

00:03:51.760 --> 00:03:58.060
 natural and 

00:03:55.390 --> 00:04:00.160
 and try to instill the child about 

00:03:58.060 --> 00:04:03.110
 all sports activities although a 

00:04:00.160 --> 00:04:06.380
 Sometimes I know that for parents 

00:04:03.110 --> 00:04:08.390
 let's say an effort in time because if 

00:04:06.380 --> 00:04:09.920
 both work from having to take it to 

00:04:08.390 --> 00:04:11.570
 sports activities and also a 

00:04:09.920 --> 00:04:13.580
 economic effort because many times 

00:04:11.570 --> 00:04:16.239
 those sports activities cost 

00:04:13.580 --> 00:04:18.880
 money but I guarantee you that 

00:04:16.239 --> 00:04:21.880
 It is a huge investment A 

00:04:18.880 --> 00:04:24.370
 tremendous future investment in your 

00:04:21.880 --> 00:04:28.060

00:04:24.370 --> 00:04:29.740

00:04:28.060 --> 00:04:32.740
 I also coach basketball and my 

00:04:29.740 --> 00:04:34.389

 our families have always been 

00:04:37.930 --> 00:04:42.759
 thanks for athletes I have lived it 

00:04:40.180 --> 00:04:45.090
 from small and from very small that 

00:04:42.759 --> 00:04:49.460
 I have use of reason I have been practicing 

00:04:45.090 --> 00:04:52.800
 sports from martial arts to 

00:04:49.460 --> 00:04:54.570

00:04:52.800 --> 00:04:57.600

 professionally to cross fitness 7 

00:04:57.600 --> 00:05:02.660
 etc. then 

00:04:59.930 --> 00:05:06.169
 in my case it has served to maintain 

00:05:02.660 --> 00:05:09.320
 always a path in my healthy life 

00:05:06.169 --> 00:05:11.360

00:05:50.790 --> 00:05:55.440
 because they are important to avoid in the 

00:05:53.010 --> 00:05:57.840
