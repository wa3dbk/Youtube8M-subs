00:00:01.790 --> 00:00:07.919
 all good health 

00:00:03.830 --> 00:00:10.260
 small addition took off to two 

00:00:07.919 --> 00:00:16.830
 previous video on the manufacture of the handle 

00:00:10.260 --> 00:00:20.100
 cork for a knife in discussions to the second 

00:00:16.830 --> 00:00:25.410
 the videos were there options offered 

00:00:20.100 --> 00:00:27.630
 mounting the assembly more precisely the handle with 1 

00:00:25.410 --> 00:00:30.539
 clips there transverse rivets there 

00:00:27.630 --> 00:00:33.090
 told well, in general, I tried 

00:00:30.539 --> 00:00:35.899
 make klep times traditional finnish 

00:00:33.090 --> 00:00:39.329
 as here at the end of the handle 

00:00:35.899 --> 00:00:41.640
 clears up and this is natural 

00:00:39.329 --> 00:00:44.460
 makes it easy because no studs rivets 

00:00:41.640 --> 00:00:48.539
 additional nuts is not it just 

00:00:44.460 --> 00:00:50.550
 shaybochka you bragging but to 

00:00:48.539 --> 00:00:54.059
 collect as knife must first of its 

00:00:50.550 --> 00:00:56.370
 glue stick on shank glue a 

00:00:54.059 --> 00:00:58.500
 then glued together when glue hardens 

00:00:56.370 --> 00:01:03.359
 already clear up the mess yourself 

00:00:58.500 --> 00:01:06.150
 shank so gluing for gluing 

00:01:03.359 --> 00:01:09.470
 this knife blades and generally I have here 

00:01:06.150 --> 00:01:13.100
 such a structure which consists of 

00:01:09.470 --> 00:01:13.100
 two studs and 

00:01:13.350 --> 00:01:19.110
 little corner in this case for such 

00:01:16.920 --> 00:01:29.970
 mounting here in the corner will drill the inscriptions 

00:01:19.110 --> 00:01:35.220
 and the knife is going like this 

00:01:29.970 --> 00:01:37.110
 I can not put a plate here 

00:01:35.220 --> 00:01:40.890
 make it wooden at all 

00:01:37.110 --> 00:01:44.299
 case this is so inserted rests on 

00:01:40.890 --> 00:01:44.299
 wooden wreath 

00:01:48.649 --> 00:01:53.310
 set so that the shank 

00:01:50.850 --> 00:01:53.850
 he went out into this hole here he is there 

00:01:53.310 --> 00:01:57.600
 sticks out 

00:01:53.850 --> 00:01:58.380
 and gadget clamps it all on 

00:01:57.600 --> 00:02:00.810
 epoxy 

00:01:58.380 --> 00:02:03.619
 epoxy glued disassembled 

00:02:00.810 --> 00:02:03.619
 construction 

00:02:07.039 --> 00:02:12.510
 sawed off vitek tail 

00:02:09.060 --> 00:02:15.660
 there is a lot to put it half the diameter 

00:02:12.510 --> 00:02:19.530
 Usually, the shaybochka remains on the peck 

00:02:15.660 --> 00:02:22.050
 rip on top that's all much 

00:02:19.530 --> 00:02:25.350
 lighter knife i tried on 

00:02:22.050 --> 00:02:27.209
 Now I will not show if that 

00:02:25.350 --> 00:02:30.150
 previous knife and saw he swims there 

00:02:27.209 --> 00:02:32.310
 literally there but 2 3 millimeters sticks out 

00:02:30.150 --> 00:02:36.870
 out of the water then this floats peeps 

00:02:32.310 --> 00:02:39.060
 You are completely the same wood log 

00:02:36.870 --> 00:02:40.640
 despite the fact that the thickness here is three with 

00:02:39.060 --> 00:02:45.060
 half a millimeter in the butt 

00:02:40.640 --> 00:02:47.370
 even thicker blade but buoyancy on it 

00:02:45.060 --> 00:02:50.810
 increased significantly so well here 

00:02:47.370 --> 00:02:53.810
 this way you can still mount 

00:02:50.810 --> 00:02:58.640
 here are such knives all thanks to all 

00:02:53.810 --> 00:02:58.640
 all the best and see you soon
