00:02:38.370 --> 00:02:38.380 
appeal to me but I still liked it he had

00:02:38.380 --> 00:02:41.670 
appeal to me but I still liked it he had
his<00:02:38.560> weird<00:02:38.890> moments<00:02:39.630> but<00:02:40.630> for<00:02:41.320> the<00:02:41.380> most<00:02:41.560> part

00:02:41.670 --> 00:02:41.680 
his weird moments but for the most part

00:02:41.680 --> 00:02:44.610 
his weird moments but for the most part
he<00:02:42.040> had<00:02:42.130> a<00:02:42.160> really<00:02:42.490> epic<00:02:42.730> style<00:02:43.330> that<00:02:44.170> fits<00:02:44.200> the

00:02:44.610 --> 00:02:44.620 
he had a really epic style that fits the

00:02:44.620 --> 00:02:46.710 
he had a really epic style that fits the
story<00:02:44.800> nicely<00:02:45.280> it's<00:02:45.700> done<00:02:45.910> very<00:02:46.180> well<00:02:46.270> and<00:02:46.630> I
