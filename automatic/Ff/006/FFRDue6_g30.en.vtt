 then I will try to do something 

00:00:44.500 --> 00:00:47.679
 quality as usual 

00:00:46.059 --> 00:00:49.059
 so today we find ourselves for the 

00:00:47.679 --> 00:00:50.769
 presentation so a keyboard of the 

00:00:49.059 --> 00:00:52.120
 mark perics so pierrick sorin like 

00:00:50.769 --> 00:00:54.219
 you are already introduced to many 

00:00:52.120 --> 00:00:56.710
 products so two mice and a carpet 

00:00:54.219 --> 00:00:57.399
 mouse for exactly that's two mice 

00:00:56.710 --> 00:00:58.629
 a mouse pad 

00:00:57.399 --> 00:01:01.140
 so we tell them we find ourselves 

00:00:58.629 --> 00:01:03.789
 introduce you to the keyboard so father x 

00:01:01.140 --> 00:01:05.830
 180 as you want to see black list 

00:01:03.789 --> 00:01:07.570
 gaming keyboard so I'm going to give myself 

00:01:05.830 --> 00:01:09.159
 some information about the 

00:01:07.570 --> 00:01:09.880
 keyboard before you open it and then 

00:01:09.159 --> 00:01:11.950
 you introduce him 

00:01:09.880 --> 00:01:13.420
 so it's a gaming keyboard radius so 

00:01:11.950 --> 00:01:16.330
 it is true anti ghosting wired keyboard 

00:01:13.420 --> 00:01:17.979
 says 19 keys in full of design 

00:01:16.330 --> 00:01:20.320
 large areas with a wrist rest 

00:01:17.979 --> 00:01:21.910
 integrated with steel plates was at 

00:01:20.320 --> 00:01:24.880
 the embedding of 2 mm and so it's a 

00:01:21.910 --> 00:01:26.620
 azerty keyboard so french concerning 

00:01:24.880 --> 00:01:28.300
 so first of all the price of the product 

00:01:26.620 --> 00:01:30.220
 you're really bluffing that's why 

00:01:28.300 --> 00:01:32.110
 that you present them he comes from 

00:01:30.220 --> 00:01:34.600
 go out and he's already priced at 24 

00:01:32.110 --> 00:01:36.970
 99 euros on amazon instead of 40 euros 

00:01:34.600 --> 00:01:38.560
 so it's really 25 euros for a 

00:01:36.970 --> 00:01:39.430
 keyboard like that before I was expecting 

00:01:38.560 --> 00:01:40.900
 not even that they are at that price 

00:01:39.430 --> 00:01:42.730
 when I saw them but during these 

00:01:40.900 --> 00:01:44.140
 super interesting more and more 

00:01:42.730 --> 00:01:45.010
 really quality this brand has 

00:01:44.140 --> 00:01:47.320
 so that's why I tell you 

00:01:45.010 --> 00:01:49.660
 recommend so I showed up quickly 

00:01:47.320 --> 00:01:51.250
 so there the box so the compatibilities 

00:01:49.660 --> 00:01:52.930
 so here they are for those who 

00:01:51.250 --> 00:01:55.780
 interested so it is compatible by 

00:01:52.930 --> 00:01:56.950
 everywhere what is it and not what to spend 

00:01:55.780 --> 00:01:58.360
 behind so I'm going to show you very 

00:01:56.950 --> 00:01:59.830
 very quickly so the information in 

00:01:58.360 --> 00:02:01.780
 French as usual I leave you 

00:01:59.830 --> 00:02:03.250
 look at them yourself I will not 

00:02:01.780 --> 00:02:04.090
 you read them as usual that does not 

00:02:03.250 --> 00:02:06.220
 not worth it 

00:02:04.090 --> 00:02:08.739
 so that's why I put my little 

00:02:06.220 --> 00:02:10.539
 camera so to open the box 

00:02:08.739 --> 00:02:13.300
 so the cardboard when we study opens 

00:02:10.539 --> 00:02:16.629
 like those in europe and as there we 

00:02:13.300 --> 00:02:18.580
 will be able to see the keyboard up which I 

00:02:16.629 --> 00:02:19.140
 I 'll ask you his sweet mans for not 

00:02:18.580 --> 00:02:21.370
 spoiling 

00:02:19.140 --> 00:02:23.560
 So here is the kg how it is 

00:02:21.370 --> 00:02:25.030
 present so here we have the us cable 

00:02:23.560 --> 00:02:26.319
 of the keyboard because yes it just works 

00:02:25.030 --> 00:02:27.880
 with a usb cable it's handy 

00:02:26.319 --> 00:02:28.840
 compared to some who offers a 

00:02:27.880 --> 00:02:30.459
 usb adapter 

00:02:28.840 --> 00:02:32.080
 in total you end up with two 

00:02:30.459 --> 00:02:33.459
 usb ports use more the two stuff 

00:02:32.080 --> 00:02:34.690
 are and where bazaar so it's a little bit 

00:02:33.459 --> 00:02:37.090
 shit we'll say when you want is 

00:02:34.690 --> 00:02:38.830
 organized on your desk regarding the 

00:02:37.090 --> 00:02:40.480
 manual notice as usual 

00:02:38.830 --> 00:02:42.430
 Chronic instructions so fast 

00:02:40.480 --> 00:02:43.959
 I think it should not be 

00:02:42.430 --> 00:02:45.310
 french and europe i will ask the 

00:02:43.959 --> 00:02:47.500
 camera very very quickly for 

00:02:45.310 --> 00:02:48.760
 meet with ap is in french but 

00:02:47.500 --> 00:02:50.290
 the less we understand very easily so 

00:02:48.760 --> 00:02:52.120
 that's all the combinations of 

00:02:50.290 --> 00:02:54.849
 keys so that you can do so 

00:02:52.120 --> 00:02:56.680
 in fact to plan your roof 

00:02:54.849 --> 00:02:58.870
 organize your keyboard so here I 

00:02:56.680 --> 00:03:00.489
 will not you go in do not show you 

00:02:58.870 --> 00:03:02.260
 to pacy in French have watched the end in 

00:03:00.489 --> 00:03:03.459
 configuration in crisis so here are the 

00:03:02.260 --> 00:03:04.780
 information in French so really 

00:03:03.459 --> 00:03:07.690
 a very very good point so who is 

00:03:04.780 --> 00:03:09.120
 really super convenient have frankly 

00:03:07.690 --> 00:03:11.080
 the keyboard seems to me to be really 

00:03:09.120 --> 00:03:14.980
 extraordinary pose the camera from between 

00:03:11.080 --> 00:03:19.120
 you 're going to take it out at the time that 

00:03:14.980 --> 00:03:20.860
 pass and we will try me I have not 

00:03:19.120 --> 00:03:22.930
 place in gt took out a little mail 

00:03:20.860 --> 00:03:25.720
 men 

00:03:22.930 --> 00:03:28.660
 here is that at six months a little 

00:03:25.720 --> 00:03:30.250
 second I pose a whole people but if 

00:03:28.660 --> 00:03:31.780
 I wanted even if we start to hit 

00:03:30.250 --> 00:03:33.820
 understand your for you when you want 

00:03:31.780 --> 00:03:35.950
 see the rendering why are not we the 

00:03:33.820 --> 00:03:37.450
 people go out so the keyboard so there there 

00:03:35.950 --> 00:03:38.829
 had a life in a beautiful cover of 

00:03:37.450 --> 00:03:40.810
 protection when you currently see 

00:03:38.829 --> 00:03:43.420
 and so the case so they were 

00:03:40.810 --> 00:03:45.519
 like this so the cabba first of all the 

00:03:43.420 --> 00:03:46.989
 cable it's a cape so again 

00:03:45.519 --> 00:03:48.910
 I do not know the material and leave it to me 

00:03:46.989 --> 00:03:49.989
 a cable in us we'll say know that 

00:03:48.910 --> 00:03:52.720
 you go it's the caps that are 

00:03:49.989 --> 00:03:53.769
 normally in May and they do 

00:03:52.720 --> 00:03:55.450
 in melee so there will be less in 

00:03:53.769 --> 00:03:56.799
 practice in castle that are really 

00:03:55.450 --> 00:03:57.420
 very hard every time we can not 

00:03:56.799 --> 00:03:59.160
 the 

00:03:57.420 --> 00:04:02.640
 to roll them up let's start it's a bit of a 

00:03:59.160 --> 00:04:04.620
 little remains of the shape as how 

00:04:02.640 --> 00:04:06.510
 received them so entirely so the 

00:04:04.620 --> 00:04:07.800
 keyboard the keyboard it's really for 

00:04:06.510 --> 00:04:09.540
 my hand me gi fi I'm going to you 

00:04:07.800 --> 00:04:12.290
 go back a little bit to show you 

00:04:09.540 --> 00:04:14.730
 a bit so how she looks 

00:04:12.290 --> 00:04:16.919
 so it is really thus superman 

00:04:14.730 --> 00:04:18.900
 quality for a fanfan price 2 25 euros 

00:04:16.919 --> 00:04:20.489
 the summer really bluffed with this quality 

00:04:18.900 --> 00:04:22.139
 so he went out he very recently 

00:04:20.489 --> 00:04:24.180
 so I'm in one of the first I 

00:04:22.139 --> 00:04:25.980
 think reviewer has presented so this 

00:04:24.180 --> 00:04:28.980
 product so I tell you you 're going to 

00:04:25.980 --> 00:04:30.870
 plug in to show you a little 

00:04:28.980 --> 00:04:31.979
 how he walks being eliminated because 

00:04:30.870 --> 00:04:36.000
 it is even more beautiful than once 

00:04:31.979 --> 00:04:37.830
 hip hop I plug 

00:04:36.000 --> 00:04:39.750
 and so here it is plugged so we 

00:04:37.830 --> 00:04:41.490
 will be able to see a little the quality in 

00:04:39.750 --> 00:04:43.139
 being illuminated so which is still a 

00:04:41.490 --> 00:04:45.510
 beautiful times so be europe and this 

00:04:43.139 --> 00:04:47.160
 gift that is illuminated so the quality 

00:04:45.510 --> 00:04:49.139
 towards talent is really beautiful good 

00:04:47.160 --> 00:04:51.030
 there is a little too much light of which I 

00:04:49.139 --> 00:04:53.130
 am but good if we see pretty much 

00:04:51.030 --> 00:04:54.720
 will have to keep the Libyan massiwa but 

00:04:53.130 --> 00:04:56.610
 frankly dominates really great 

00:04:54.720 --> 00:04:58.919
 well in verve who really a very very 

00:04:56.610 --> 00:05:01.800
 good quality clear green glass so a 

00:04:58.919 --> 00:05:03.479
 really really have both 

00:05:01.800 --> 00:05:05.490
 keyboard qualities but try to you 

00:05:03.479 --> 00:05:07.050
 so show that my part behind up 

00:05:05.490 --> 00:05:08.550
 how he is so for what he 

00:05:07.050 --> 00:05:09.990
 needed a little bit wrong when 

00:05:08.550 --> 00:05:11.640
 from behind it is very basic 

00:05:09.990 --> 00:05:13.140
 so here's a little bit how is that so 

00:05:11.640 --> 00:05:15.000
 you have the most avoid so put 

00:05:13.140 --> 00:05:16.590
 the small ties so to be able to 

00:05:15.000 --> 00:05:18.510
 ask your keyboard so his features his 

00:05:16.590 --> 00:05:20.340
 pop and you put them back as this 

00:05:18.510 --> 00:05:22.530
 site listed very well known so there we 

00:05:20.340 --> 00:05:23.910
 you have small reinforcements whose cld has 

00:05:22.530 --> 00:05:26.520
 put if you have three donations for 

00:05:23.910 --> 00:05:28.169
 protect the keyboard not behind see 

00:05:26.520 --> 00:05:29.880
 really very basic but it is beautiful 

00:05:28.169 --> 00:05:31.020
 for me I really think five 

00:05:29.880 --> 00:05:33.300
 years so for people who seek 

00:05:31.020 --> 00:05:34.950
 a keyboard and say more is 

00:05:33.300 --> 00:05:36.000
 light practice and what's good is 

00:05:34.950 --> 00:05:37.680
 that it is really light in addition to these 

00:05:36.000 --> 00:05:39.060
 bags and nice compared to his stalking 

00:05:37.680 --> 00:05:40.410
 the city ​​are really water is him 

00:05:39.060 --> 00:05:40.700
 really light the keys and do not 

00:05:40.410 --> 00:05:42.479
 noise 

00:05:40.700 --> 00:05:43.680
 look at it's not keys in 

00:05:42.479 --> 00:05:45.030
 mechanical cd 

00:05:43.680 --> 00:05:46.440
 some law banks says that I already 

00:05:45.030 --> 00:05:47.940
 take such a way it's a touch of 

00:05:46.440 --> 00:05:48.870
 mechanical keys so that's really 

00:05:47.940 --> 00:05:50.789
 a lot of noise so it's really a 

00:05:48.870 --> 00:05:52.289
 little boring when you're next to 

00:05:50.789 --> 00:05:53.820
 people dare they want to listen to TV 

00:05:52.289 --> 00:05:55.710
 watts is really unpleasant as we go 

00:05:53.820 --> 00:05:56.639
 to be good here is to realize in a 

00:05:55.710 --> 00:05:57.900
 sense i will introduce you a little 

00:05:56.639 --> 00:06:00.000
 all the features including cig 

00:05:57.900 --> 00:06:01.500
 you have the possibility to activate 

00:06:00.000 --> 00:06:02.729
 disable the key not every 

00:06:01.500 --> 00:06:04.169
 explain in front of you know the 

00:06:02.729 --> 00:06:05.270
 possibility to activate the backlight 

00:06:04.169 --> 00:06:08.009
 to disable it 

00:06:05.270 --> 00:06:10.020
 so here and up you still have 

00:06:08.009 --> 00:06:11.820
 some little button to lock 

00:06:10.020 --> 00:06:14.460
 unlock all he touched the 

00:06:11.820 --> 00:06:15.630
 keyword gehring month so I hope that 

00:06:14.460 --> 00:06:17.250
 the video the bo will be more beautiful it's a 

00:06:15.630 --> 00:06:18.660
 very very short video but I think this 

00:06:17.250 --> 00:06:20.400
 which will please you do not hesitate yet 

00:06:18.660 --> 00:06:21.050
 once the barracks and the video to 

00:06:20.400 --> 00:06:23.039
 share it 

00:06:21.050 --> 00:06:24.419
 then give me your opinion at the same time 

00:06:23.039 --> 00:06:26.550
 about what you think of what I'm doing
