00:01:50.130 --> 00:01:50.140 
that the back actually all it has is

00:01:50.140 --> 00:01:52.469 
that the back actually all it has is
this<00:01:50.409> one<00:01:50.770> screw<00:01:51.100> on<00:01:51.130> it<00:01:51.250> and<00:01:51.520> this<00:01:51.640> is<00:01:51.760> do<00:01:52.450> not

00:01:52.469 --> 00:01:52.479 
this one screw on it and this is do not

00:01:52.479 --> 00:01:54.899 
this one screw on it and this is do not
unscrew<00:01:53.290> I'm<00:01:53.650> not<00:01:54.159> sure<00:01:54.369> what<00:01:54.520> that<00:01:54.700> does<00:01:54.880> but

00:02:15.650 --> 00:02:21.560 
unscrew these four it pops up
kind<00:02:16.650> of<00:02:16.680> cool<00:02:17.900> this<00:02:18.900> one<00:02:19.080> uses<00:02:19.470> also<00:02:19.680> the<00:02:20.570> 24

00:02:21.560 --> 00:02:21.570 
kind of cool this one uses also the 24

00:02:21.570 --> 00:02:23.960 
kind of cool this one uses also the 24
millimeter<00:02:21.780> straps<00:02:22.320> same<00:02:22.770> as<00:02:22.980> the<00:02:23.220> BR<00:02:23.610> one

00:02:23.960 --> 00:02:23.970 
millimeter straps same as the BR one

00:02:23.970 --> 00:02:26.090 
millimeter straps same as the BR one
size<00:02:24.240> which<00:02:24.510> is<00:02:24.690> interesting<00:02:25.380> considering

00:02:26.090 --> 00:02:26.100 
size which is interesting considering

00:02:26.100 --> 00:02:28.340 
size which is interesting considering
that<00:02:26.370> it's<00:02:26.640> a<00:02:26.780> significantly<00:02:27.780> smaller<00:02:28.110> watch

00:02:28.340 --> 00:02:28.350 
that it's a significantly smaller watch

00:02:28.350 --> 00:02:33.290 
that it's a significantly smaller watch
means<00:02:28.710> is<00:02:28.890> the<00:02:28.980> same<00:02:29.190> size<00:02:31.220> straps<00:02:32.220> but<00:02:32.880> that

00:02:33.290 --> 00:02:33.300 
means is the same size straps but that

00:02:33.300 --> 00:02:34.820 
means is the same size straps but that
also<00:02:33.450> gives<00:02:33.750> it<00:02:33.870> kind<00:02:34.020> of<00:02:34.110> a<00:02:34.200> neat<00:02:34.380> look<00:02:34.560> to<00:02:34.740> it

00:02:34.820 --> 00:02:34.830 
also gives it kind of a neat look to it

00:02:34.830 --> 00:02:37.880 
also gives it kind of a neat look to it
which<00:02:35.010> I<00:02:35.190> which<00:02:35.460> I<00:02:35.580> really<00:02:35.850> like<00:02:36.590> Khan<00:02:37.590> is<00:02:37.740> not

00:02:37.880 --> 00:02:37.890 
which I which I really like Khan is not

00:02:37.890 --> 00:02:40.130 
which I which I really like Khan is not
screw<00:02:38.160> down<00:02:38.280> on<00:02:38.460> these<00:02:38.610> ones<00:02:38.820> but<00:02:39.330> has<00:02:39.840> a<00:02:39.870> nice

00:02:40.130 --> 00:02:40.140 
screw down on these ones but has a nice

00:02:40.140 --> 00:02:42.790 
screw down on these ones but has a nice
little<00:02:40.350> grip<00:02:40.650> on<00:02:40.800> it<00:02:41.180> assigned<00:02:42.180> bail<00:02:42.420> Ross

00:02:42.790 --> 00:02:42.800 
little grip on it assigned bail Ross

00:02:42.800 --> 00:02:45.290 
little grip on it assigned bail Ross
ampersand<00:02:43.800> sign<00:02:44.040> they're<00:02:44.340> really<00:02:44.880> cool<00:02:45.090> I

00:02:48.170 --> 00:02:48.180 
really like this watch have to see this

00:02:48.180 --> 00:02:50.510 
really like this watch have to see this
watch<00:02:48.390> that<00:02:48.660> definitely<00:02:49.200> gets<00:02:50.160> a<00:02:50.340> lot<00:02:50.490> of

00:02:50.510 --> 00:02:50.520

00:02:52.670 --> 00:02:52.680 
looks and a lot of comments on it simply

00:02:52.680 --> 00:02:56.510 
looks and a lot of comments on it simply
because<00:02:52.950> it<00:02:53.070> looks<00:02:53.220> so<00:02:53.310> funky<00:02:54.000> right<00:02:55.040> the<00:02:56.040> one

00:02:56.510 --> 00:02:56.520 
because it looks so funky right the one

00:02:56.520 --> 00:02:59.210 
because it looks so funky right the one
thing<00:02:56.670> one<00:02:57.209> thing<00:02:57.240> about<00:02:57.990> the<00:02:58.200> balloon<00:02:58.470> one<00:02:58.709> on

00:02:59.210 --> 00:02:59.220 
thing one thing about the balloon one on

00:02:59.220 --> 00:03:00.949 
thing one thing about the balloon one on
the<00:02:59.400> Bell<00:02:59.550> and<00:02:59.700> Ross<00:02:59.850> is<00:03:00.030> that<00:03:00.209> it<00:03:00.390> goes<00:03:00.540> blue

00:03:00.949 --> 00:03:00.959 
the Bell and Ross is that it goes blue

00:03:00.959 --> 00:03:03.830 
the Bell and Ross is that it goes blue
and<00:03:01.260> one<00:03:02.100> thing<00:03:02.280> I've<00:03:02.400> noticed<00:03:03.300> when<00:03:03.570> trying

00:03:03.830 --> 00:03:03.840 
and one thing I've noticed when trying

00:03:03.840 --> 00:03:05.990 
and one thing I've noticed when trying
to<00:03:03.930> charge<00:03:04.260> it<00:03:04.530> is<00:03:04.740> that<00:03:05.070> it<00:03:05.250> doesn't<00:03:05.760> charge

00:03:05.990 --> 00:03:06.000 
to charge it is that it doesn't charge

00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:07.490 
to charge it is that it doesn't charge
that<00:03:06.270> well<00:03:06.420> with<00:03:06.540> our<00:03:06.660> official<00:03:07.080> light<00:03:07.260> and

00:03:07.490 --> 00:03:07.500 
that well with our official light and

00:03:07.500 --> 00:03:09.560 
that well with our official light and
I'm<00:03:07.590> not<00:03:07.740> sure<00:03:07.950> if<00:03:08.370> because<00:03:08.760> the<00:03:09.030> spectrum

00:03:09.560 --> 00:03:09.570 
I'm not sure if because the spectrum

00:03:09.570 --> 00:03:11.480 
I'm not sure if because the spectrum
that<00:03:09.720> it<00:03:09.870> glows<00:03:10.140> is<00:03:10.380> not<00:03:10.590> actually<00:03:11.070> inherent

00:03:11.480 --> 00:03:11.490 
that it glows is not actually inherent

00:03:11.490 --> 00:03:13.460 
that it glows is not actually inherent
in<00:03:11.610> the<00:03:11.790> in<00:03:12.000> the<00:03:12.510> artificial<00:03:13.050> light<00:03:13.200> that<00:03:13.380> I'm

00:03:13.460 --> 00:03:13.470 
in the in the artificial light that I'm

00:03:13.470 --> 00:03:17.449 
in the in the artificial light that I'm
using<00:03:13.740> or<00:03:14.310> or<00:03:14.700> what<00:03:14.970> but<00:03:15.380> it<00:03:16.380> charges<00:03:16.709> way

00:03:17.449 --> 00:03:17.459 
using or or what but it charges way

00:03:17.459 --> 00:03:19.220 
using or or what but it charges way
better<00:03:17.730> when<00:03:17.940> I<00:03:17.970> put<00:03:18.180> it<00:03:18.240> outside<00:03:18.330> and<00:03:18.780> charge

00:03:19.220 --> 00:03:19.230 
better when I put it outside and charge

00:03:19.230 --> 00:03:21.740 
better when I put it outside and charge
in<00:03:19.350> natural<00:03:19.680> sunlight<00:03:20.150> Green<00:03:21.150> lumens<00:03:21.630> that

00:03:21.740 --> 00:03:21.750 
in natural sunlight Green lumens that

00:03:21.750 --> 00:03:23.420 
in natural sunlight Green lumens that
work<00:03:21.959> just<00:03:22.350> fine<00:03:22.590> when<00:03:22.830> I'm<00:03:22.920> charging<00:03:23.190> with

00:03:23.420 --> 00:03:23.430 
work just fine when I'm charging with

00:03:23.430 --> 00:03:25.190 
work just fine when I'm charging with
with<00:03:23.730> any<00:03:23.880> sort<00:03:24.120> of<00:03:24.180> artificial<00:03:24.690> lights<00:03:24.900> but

00:03:25.190 --> 00:03:25.200 
with any sort of artificial lights but

00:03:25.200 --> 00:03:27.290 
with any sort of artificial lights but
but<00:03:25.560> the<00:03:25.739> bell<00:03:25.920> Ross<00:03:26.220> and<00:03:26.610> not<00:03:26.730> so<00:03:26.910> much<00:03:27.090> I've

00:03:27.290 --> 00:03:27.300 
but the bell Ross and not so much I've

00:03:27.300 --> 00:03:28.940 
but the bell Ross and not so much I've
held<00:03:27.540> it<00:03:27.690> straight<00:03:27.989> up<00:03:28.019> to<00:03:28.260> flashlights<00:03:28.800> and

00:03:28.940 --> 00:03:28.950 
held it straight up to flashlights and

00:03:28.950 --> 00:03:31.040 
held it straight up to flashlights and
stuff<00:03:29.130> like<00:03:29.250> that<00:03:29.430> and<00:03:29.610> just<00:03:29.670> doesn't<00:03:30.050> absorb

00:03:31.040 --> 00:03:31.050 
stuff like that and just doesn't absorb

00:03:31.050 --> 00:03:33.080 
stuff like that and just doesn't absorb
it<00:03:31.410> just<00:03:31.650> doesn't<00:03:32.519> glow<00:03:32.730> that<00:03:32.940> much

00:03:33.080 --> 00:03:33.090 
it just doesn't glow that much

00:03:33.090 --> 00:03:35.900 
it just doesn't glow that much
afterwards<00:03:33.480> so<00:03:34.250> something<00:03:35.250> to<00:03:35.340> note<00:03:35.519> with<00:03:35.730> the

00:03:35.900 --> 00:03:35.910 
afterwards so something to note with the

00:03:35.910 --> 00:03:38.780 
afterwards so something to note with the
with<00:03:36.120> the<00:03:36.209> bell<00:03:36.360> Ross<00:03:36.920> the<00:03:37.920> movement<00:03:38.340> inside
