 Thank you very much for seeing a lot of people when I raised the video of the hand back 

00:00:05.279 --> 00:00:12.170
 I was glad to hear the comment play 

00:00:09.290 --> 00:00:18.330
 More easy-to-understand 

00:00:12.170 --> 00:00:24.480
 Because there may be a person who is a little difficult to understand in the animation that there is no explanation 

00:00:18.330 --> 00:00:25.650
 Hey I described the way is when the practice I think I want to try this yourself is theft Tegaeshi 

00:00:24.480 --> 00:00:27.740
 I would like to 

00:00:25.650 --> 00:00:30.970
 If it is something helpful 

00:00:27.740 --> 00:00:30.970
 I am happy if 

00:00:31.730 --> 00:00:37.820
 A number Megau 

00:00:33.900 --> 00:00:37.820
 It is street of video which we raised before 

00:00:37.860 --> 00:00:45.520
 As the first practice method for people 

00:00:42.490 --> 00:00:48.920
 With the ash on the ground 

00:00:45.520 --> 00:00:51.630
 While wearing Among speak 

00:00:48.920 --> 00:00:54.579
 It is good with such a movement 

00:00:51.630 --> 00:00:57.969
 It was diverted to rotate 

00:00:54.579 --> 00:01:00.820
 At first I did practice like this 

00:00:57.969 --> 00:01:04.019
 Rubbed to the ground 

00:01:00.820 --> 00:01:07.339
 Push out the next ash from behind 

00:01:04.019 --> 00:01:07.339
 Yes it came out to my 

00:01:08.690 --> 00:01:16.990
 Let me slide it 

00:01:12.080 --> 00:01:16.990
 That remains the slide to have it in because it is not stable Te 

00:01:17.650 --> 00:01:29.740
 Slip it and come to the right Yes I will support the song with the ring finger and little finger 

00:01:24.710 --> 00:01:29.740
 I was practicing kanji at first 

00:01:30.420 --> 00:01:36.880
 Try pushing it out with that kind of movement 

00:01:33.920 --> 00:01:42.659
 Contact Yes came out before 

00:01:36.880 --> 00:01:42.659
 I'll catch the chop in the 31 tail that Teku Slide to the right 

00:01:43.950 --> 00:01:49.380
 Yes yo-the end 

00:01:46.900 --> 00:01:52.780
 Rub with wood grain 

00:01:49.380 --> 00:01:55.210
 Bring to the back of the range of light 

00:01:52.780 --> 00:01:58.020
 Along with the push 

00:01:55.210 --> 00:01:58.020
 Thumb up 

00:01:58.240 --> 00:02:03.030
 To the right 

00:02:00.100 --> 00:02:06.380
 It went into force 

00:02:03.030 --> 00:02:06.380
 Catch with ring finger and little finger 

00:02:08.429 --> 00:02:14.960
 Of feeling 

00:02:10.470 --> 00:02:18.640
 Treatment of reiki odor or yes 

00:02:14.960 --> 00:02:18.640
 At first I did 

00:02:20.900 --> 00:02:30.510
 I'm not limited to mahjong 

00:02:23.610 --> 00:02:33.410
 Suddenly One day many times and is also also doing slowly this many times and have been doing this many times 

00:02:30.510 --> 00:02:33.410
 That now 

00:02:34.170 --> 00:02:39.740
 I will definitely go for something good 

00:02:40.420 --> 00:02:47.360
 That feels good now and feel 

00:02:43.500 --> 00:02:48.750
 A'll sweet became sweet good 

00:02:47.360 --> 00:02:52.160
 Hmm 

00:02:48.750 --> 00:02:52.160
 You can have the day to remember the feel 

00:02:54.920 --> 00:03:01.820
 My first 

00:02:57.690 --> 00:03:01.820
 It was like this as a practice method 

00:03:03.700 --> 00:03:06.209
 Yes 

00:03:06.680 --> 00:03:13.460
 See 

00:03:08.600 --> 00:03:16.300
 A little bit of the right hand in the free time while doing something 

00:03:13.460 --> 00:03:16.300
 Gymnastically 

00:03:17.780 --> 00:03:22.330
 Or even whether that killing time after the right hand say of q 2 

00:03:22.660 --> 00:03:25.470
 When touching 

00:03:26.490 --> 00:03:36.610
 One day suddenly feels great now 

00:03:29.420 --> 00:03:36.610
 It can suddenly pop one day when you feel here that became well made of now 

00:03:38.840 --> 00:03:45.710
 If you are playing mahjong with petal 

00:03:41.690 --> 00:03:49.870
 The other party 's self is clear and the other party is 

00:03:45.710 --> 00:03:52.530
 In the midst of cutting, this time killing spirit souls come round 

00:03:49.870 --> 00:03:54.190
 Or try to round and round turning 

00:03:52.530 --> 00:03:57.030
 Something 

00:03:54.190 --> 00:03:57.030
 Your own child 

00:03:59.100 --> 00:04:05.850
 It 's your hand 

00:04:01.240 --> 00:04:05.850
 If you say that morning martha is great, it is good 

00:04:05.880 --> 00:04:11.150
 I think that everyone moves a little bit 

00:04:11.290 --> 00:04:14.280
 Well in that part 

00:04:15.620 --> 00:04:21.930
 If you get better 

00:04:18.489 --> 00:04:21.930
 The best kana and now 

00:04:23.960 --> 00:04:27.850
 If you remember this movement 

00:04:30.920 --> 00:04:35.380
 Try moving just your finger without yes 

00:04:35.780 --> 00:04:39.100
 Grab the right lung 

00:04:40.060 --> 00:04:46.320
 The dog good morning also cuts behind and slides the front ash to the right with the thumb 

00:04:47.090 --> 00:04:51.750
 Somewhat black tea as an image 

00:04:49.760 --> 00:04:54.470
 Twist 

00:04:51.750 --> 00:04:54.470
 It is such an image 

00:05:05.020 --> 00:05:09.000
 And speed things up 

00:05:10.289 --> 00:05:18.169
 Or Konanda or speed has gradually increased 

00:05:14.500 --> 00:05:21.279
 Will be able to come unconsciously and beautifully 

00:05:18.169 --> 00:05:21.279
 I think 

00:05:23.360 --> 00:05:30.960
 I just watched my own video 

00:05:26.590 --> 00:05:30.960
 I wonder if there is something more easy to understand 

00:05:31.980 --> 00:05:40.910
 For those who do not know in other videos 

00:05:35.120 --> 00:05:43.860
 At first I thought that I would like to explain a little about what I would do if I practiced like this 

00:05:40.910 --> 00:05:44.960
 I tried to raise again 

00:05:43.860 --> 00:05:48.060
 Oh dear 

00:05:44.960 --> 00:05:51.230
 If it comes to someone's reference somewhere 

00:05:48.060 --> 00:05:51.230
 I'm glad 

00:05:54.689 --> 00:06:02.400
 Here at all 

00:05:56.910 --> 00:06:03.810
 People who think that their heads are going to be full, but everyone can not do it like this practice 

00:06:02.400 --> 00:06:06.500
 Do you want to try? 

00:06:03.810 --> 00:06:06.500
 How is it ? 

00:06:06.510 --> 00:06:10.790
 Star to slide while wearing the other decided 

00:06:12.520 --> 00:06:16.199
 Let it ride and push it out from behind 

00:06:19.370 --> 00:06:27.300
 Movement is going to give close to the right thumb, such 

00:06:24.040 --> 00:06:27.300
 Re middle finger and ring finger 

00:06:28.740 --> 00:06:35.630
 If you push it forward, the junior gets caught between the fingers. 

00:06:39.080 --> 00:06:43.180
 Will be able to 

00:06:46.190 --> 00:06:49.000
 It is like this
