gonna<00:03:01.880> take<00:03:02.359> this<00:03:02.540> thing<00:03:02.780> and<00:03:03.049> instead<00:03:03.650> of

00:03:03.789 --> 00:03:03.799 
gonna take this thing and instead of

00:03:03.799 --> 00:03:05.949 
gonna take this thing and instead of
using<00:03:04.010> it<00:03:04.160> in<00:03:04.250> the<00:03:04.310> down<00:03:04.459> position<00:03:04.519> let's<00:03:05.239> flip

00:03:05.949 --> 00:03:05.959 
using it in the down position let's flip

00:03:05.959 --> 00:03:09.009 
using it in the down position let's flip
the<00:03:06.079> trigger<00:03:06.440> to<00:03:06.799> the<00:03:06.889> up<00:03:07.299> and<00:03:08.299> still<00:03:08.810> low

00:03:09.009 --> 00:03:09.019 
the trigger to the up and still low

00:03:09.019 --> 00:03:10.240 
the trigger to the up and still low
we'll<00:03:09.260> go<00:03:09.350> back<00:03:09.500> to<00:03:09.590> where<00:03:09.709> we<00:03:09.739> had<00:03:09.950> to<00:03:10.100> begin

00:03:10.240 --> 00:03:10.250 
we'll go back to where we had to begin

00:03:10.250 --> 00:03:13.390 
we'll go back to where we had to begin
with<00:03:10.750> and<00:03:11.750> I've<00:03:12.410> rearranged<00:03:13.040> some<00:03:13.220> of<00:03:13.340> the

00:03:13.390 --> 00:03:13.400 
with and I've rearranged some of the

00:03:13.400 --> 00:03:17.920 
with and I've rearranged some of the
controls<00:03:13.760> up<00:03:13.910> top<00:03:14.120> as<00:03:14.299> well<00:03:16.269> this<00:03:17.269> town<00:03:17.720> is

00:03:17.920 --> 00:03:17.930 
controls up top as well this town is

00:03:17.930 --> 00:03:19.780 
controls up top as well this town is
we're<00:03:18.709> gonna<00:03:18.859> run<00:03:19.040> the<00:03:19.130> blend<00:03:19.459> a<00:03:19.579> little<00:03:19.670> bit

00:03:19.780 --> 00:03:19.790 
we're gonna run the blend a little bit

00:03:19.790 --> 00:03:22.569 
we're gonna run the blend a little bit
back<00:03:20.030> off<00:03:20.209> a<00:03:20.239> little<00:03:20.359> bit<00:03:20.569> and<00:03:21.340> just<00:03:22.340> kind<00:03:22.430> of

00:03:22.569 --> 00:03:22.579 
back off a little bit and just kind of

00:03:22.579 --> 00:03:24.370 
back off a little bit and just kind of
let<00:03:22.730> this<00:03:22.880> add<00:03:23.120> some<00:03:23.359> color<00:03:23.600> to<00:03:23.690> your<00:03:23.900> basic

00:03:24.370 --> 00:03:24.380 
let this add some color to your basic

00:03:24.380 --> 00:03:26.890 
let this add some color to your basic
clean<00:03:24.620> tone<00:03:24.889> and<00:03:25.220> we'll<00:03:25.910> do<00:03:26.090> it<00:03:26.239> wrap<00:03:26.660> it<00:03:26.690> all

00:03:26.890 --> 00:03:26.900 
clean tone and we'll do it wrap it all

00:03:26.900 --> 00:03:28.210 
clean tone and we'll do it wrap it all
together<00:03:27.079> in<00:03:27.380> a<00:03:27.440> lovely<00:03:27.709> little<00:03:27.739> riff<00:03:28.069> from

00:03:28.210 --> 00:03:28.220 
together in a lovely little riff from

00:03:28.220 --> 00:03:59.790 
together in a lovely little riff from
the<00:03:28.370> spin-doctors<00:03:29.000> so<00:03:29.299> here<00:03:29.720> we<00:03:29.780> go

00:03:59.790 --> 00:03:59.800 

00:03:59.800 --> 00:04:02.020 

all<00:04:00.800> right<00:04:01.010> now<00:04:01.190> obviously<00:04:01.580> in<00:04:01.700> that<00:04:01.820> last

00:04:02.020 --> 00:04:02.030 
all right now obviously in that last

00:04:02.030 --> 00:04:04.090 
all right now obviously in that last
clip<00:04:02.270> we<00:04:02.390> were<00:04:02.690> running<00:04:03.440> the<00:04:03.530> thing<00:04:03.800> a<00:04:04.010> little

00:04:04.090 --> 00:04:04.100 
clip we were running the thing a little

00:04:04.100 --> 00:04:06.430 
clip we were running the thing a little
bit<00:04:04.310> more<00:04:04.430> subtle<00:04:04.820> and<00:04:05.510> less<00:04:05.810> dramatic<00:04:06.320> than

00:04:06.430 --> 00:04:06.440 
bit more subtle and less dramatic than

00:04:06.440 --> 00:04:09.250 
bit more subtle and less dramatic than
we<00:04:06.590> were<00:04:06.710> in<00:04:06.830> the<00:04:06.890> first<00:04:07.040> two<00:04:07.310> clips<00:04:08.140> to<00:04:09.140> be

00:04:09.250 --> 00:04:09.260 
we were in the first two clips to be

00:04:09.260 --> 00:04:10.930 
we were in the first two clips to be
completely<00:04:09.620> honest<00:04:09.980> even<00:04:10.190> with<00:04:10.370> the<00:04:10.460> blend<00:04:10.760> at

00:04:10.930 --> 00:04:10.940 
completely honest even with the blend at

00:04:10.940 --> 00:04:13.300 
completely honest even with the blend at
a<00:04:10.970> hundred<00:04:11.240> percent<00:04:11.480> on<00:04:12.020> that<00:04:12.320> setting<00:04:12.650> or

00:04:13.300 --> 00:04:13.310 
a hundred percent on that setting or

00:04:13.310 --> 00:04:15.970 
a hundred percent on that setting or
we've<00:04:13.490> dialed<00:04:13.790> the<00:04:14.000> the<00:04:14.900> trigger<00:04:15.230> going<00:04:15.740> up

00:04:15.970 --> 00:04:15.980 
we've dialed the the trigger going up

00:04:15.980 --> 00:04:19.449 
we've dialed the the trigger going up
instead<00:04:16.370> of<00:04:16.519> down<00:04:17.260> the<00:04:18.260> effect<00:04:18.650> is<00:04:18.830> still<00:04:19.130> not

00:04:19.449 --> 00:04:19.459 
instead of down the effect is still not

00:04:19.459 --> 00:04:21.520 
instead of down the effect is still not
quite<00:04:19.850> as<00:04:20.000> dramatic<00:04:20.120> as<00:04:20.930> when<00:04:21.200> it's<00:04:21.320> in<00:04:21.440> the

00:04:21.520 --> 00:04:21.530 
quite as dramatic as when it's in the

00:04:21.530 --> 00:04:23.470 
quite as dramatic as when it's in the
down<00:04:21.709> setting<00:04:22.190> and<00:04:22.430> I<00:04:22.910> mentioned<00:04:23.270> that<00:04:23.330> there

00:04:23.470 --> 00:04:23.480 
down setting and I mentioned that there

00:04:23.480 --> 00:04:24.820 
down setting and I mentioned that there
are<00:04:23.510> some<00:04:23.750> differences<00:04:24.200> I<00:04:24.320> noticed<00:04:24.590> in<00:04:24.740> the

00:04:24.820 --> 00:04:24.830 
are some differences I noticed in the

00:04:24.830 --> 00:04:26.830 
are some differences I noticed in the
units<00:04:25.130> of<00:04:25.400> between<00:04:25.910> this<00:04:26.090> and<00:04:26.390> the<00:04:26.450> mad<00:04:26.630> be

00:04:26.830 --> 00:04:26.840 
units of between this and the mad be

00:04:26.840 --> 00:04:31.060

00:04:31.060 --> 00:04:31.070 
Nautilus Neutron free filter one of the

00:04:31.070 --> 00:04:32.290 
Nautilus Neutron free filter one of the
differences<00:04:31.520> being<00:04:31.730> I<00:04:31.910> feel<00:04:32.060> like<00:04:32.180> the

00:04:32.290 --> 00:04:32.300 
differences being I feel like the

00:04:32.300 --> 00:04:34.930 
differences being I feel like the
Nautilus<00:04:32.720> does<00:04:32.960> or<00:04:33.830> at<00:04:33.980> least<00:04:34.130> my<00:04:34.370> build<00:04:34.610> of<00:04:34.790> it

00:04:34.930 --> 00:04:34.940 
Nautilus does or at least my build of it

00:04:34.940 --> 00:04:38.530 
Nautilus does or at least my build of it
does<00:04:35.930> the<00:04:36.440> up<00:04:36.590> trigger<00:04:36.980> effects<00:04:37.730> a<00:04:38.000> whole<00:04:38.390> lot

00:04:38.530 --> 00:04:38.540 
does the up trigger effects a whole lot

00:04:38.540 --> 00:04:39.910 
does the up trigger effects a whole lot
more<00:04:38.660> dramatically<00:04:39.230> you<00:04:39.320> can<00:04:39.470> get<00:04:39.590> a<00:04:39.620> lot

00:04:39.910 --> 00:04:39.920 
more dramatically you can get a lot

00:04:39.920 --> 00:04:42.430 
more dramatically you can get a lot
deeper<00:04:40.190> effect<00:04:40.490> out<00:04:40.940> of<00:04:41.120> those<00:04:41.300> than<00:04:42.170> you<00:04:42.260> can

00:04:42.430 --> 00:04:42.440 
deeper effect out of those than you can

00:04:42.440 --> 00:04:44.050 
deeper effect out of those than you can
on<00:04:42.470> this<00:04:42.710> one<00:04:42.890> even<00:04:43.070> with<00:04:43.310> the<00:04:43.460> added<00:04:43.580> controls

00:04:44.050 --> 00:04:44.060 
on this one even with the added controls

00:04:44.060 --> 00:04:46.810 
on this one even with the added controls
on<00:04:44.270> it<00:04:44.300> that's<00:04:45.140> not<00:04:45.290> a<00:04:45.350> big<00:04:45.770> detraction<00:04:46.340> simply

00:04:46.810 --> 00:04:46.820 
on it that's not a big detraction simply

00:04:46.820 --> 00:04:48.310 
on it that's not a big detraction simply
just<00:04:47.000> a<00:04:47.120> difference<00:04:47.450> between<00:04:47.810> the<00:04:47.900> two<00:04:48.080> but

00:04:48.310 --> 00:04:48.320 
just a difference between the two but

00:04:48.320 --> 00:04:50.290 
just a difference between the two but
Tom<00:04:48.590> it<00:04:49.190> was<00:04:49.340> one<00:04:49.580> thing<00:04:49.760> that<00:04:49.880> I've<00:04:49.970> noticed

00:04:50.290 --> 00:04:50.300 
Tom it was one thing that I've noticed

00:04:50.300 --> 00:04:52.600 
Tom it was one thing that I've noticed
in<00:04:50.390> my<00:04:50.419> testing<00:04:50.900> I'm<00:04:51.680> shifting<00:04:52.130> gears<00:04:52.520> a

00:04:52.600 --> 00:04:52.610 
in my testing I'm shifting gears a

00:04:52.610 --> 00:04:55.150 
in my testing I'm shifting gears a
little<00:04:52.669> bit<00:04:52.970> I<00:04:53.570> like<00:04:53.870> to<00:04:54.260> take<00:04:54.590> effects<00:04:54.919> and

00:04:55.150 --> 00:04:55.160 
little bit I like to take effects and

00:04:55.160 --> 00:04:58.030 
little bit I like to take effects and
use<00:04:55.340> them<00:04:55.550> for<00:04:55.730> things<00:04:55.940> that<00:04:56.890> they<00:04:57.890> aren't

00:04:58.030 --> 00:04:58.040 
use them for things that they aren't

00:04:58.040 --> 00:05:00.310 
use them for things that they aren't
normally<00:04:58.400> known<00:04:58.580> for<00:04:58.880> so<00:04:59.450> for<00:04:59.690> this<00:04:59.780> next<00:04:59.840> clip

00:05:00.310 --> 00:05:00.320 
normally known for so for this next clip

00:05:00.320 --> 00:05:01.870 
normally known for so for this next clip
I'm<00:05:00.440> actually<00:05:00.560> going<00:05:00.800> to<00:05:00.860> do<00:05:00.950> some<00:05:01.130> swells<00:05:01.520> and

00:05:01.870 --> 00:05:01.880 
I'm actually going to do some swells and

00:05:01.880 --> 00:05:03.909 
I'm actually going to do some swells and
what<00:05:02.090> I've<00:05:02.210> done<00:05:02.390> here<00:05:02.810> is<00:05:03.020> I've<00:05:03.590> set<00:05:03.800> the

00:05:03.909 --> 00:05:03.919 
what I've done here is I've set the

00:05:03.919 --> 00:05:07.210 
what I've done here is I've set the
sensitivity<00:05:04.540> way<00:05:05.540> high<00:05:05.810> and<00:05:06.230> the<00:05:06.350> decay<00:05:06.770> way

00:05:07.210 --> 00:05:07.220 
sensitivity way high and the decay way

00:05:07.220 --> 00:05:10.600 
sensitivity way high and the decay way
high<00:05:08.710> among<00:05:09.710> some<00:05:09.890> of<00:05:09.980> the<00:05:10.040> other<00:05:10.070> controls

00:05:10.600 --> 00:05:10.610 
high among some of the other controls

00:05:10.610 --> 00:05:12.430 
high among some of the other controls
and<00:05:10.850> I'm<00:05:11.600> actually<00:05:11.840> going<00:05:12.050> to<00:05:12.169> swell<00:05:12.410> the

00:05:12.430 --> 00:05:12.440 
and I'm actually going to swell the

00:05:12.440 --> 00:05:16.780 
and I'm actually going to swell the
volume<00:05:12.950> into<00:05:13.460> the<00:05:13.580> filter<00:05:14.470> so<00:05:15.470> that<00:05:15.500> as<00:05:15.919> the

00:05:16.780 --> 00:05:16.790 
volume into the filter so that as the

00:05:16.790 --> 00:05:19.810 
volume into the filter so that as the
volume<00:05:17.210> rides<00:05:17.630> up<00:05:17.930> the<00:05:18.650> filter<00:05:18.980> sort<00:05:19.220> of<00:05:19.370> opens

00:05:21.550 --> 00:05:21.560 
and closes a little bit and you get that

00:05:21.560 --> 00:05:23.890 
and closes a little bit and you get that
kind<00:05:21.770> of<00:05:21.800> bowel<00:05:22.040> sound<00:05:22.430> as<00:05:22.700> the<00:05:23.270> volume<00:05:23.630> comes

00:05:23.890 --> 00:05:23.900 
kind of bowel sound as the volume comes

00:05:23.900 --> 00:05:24.970 
kind of bowel sound as the volume comes
and<00:05:24.200> we're<00:05:24.320> going<00:05:24.440> to<00:05:24.500> run<00:05:24.620> this<00:05:24.740> thing

00:05:24.970 --> 00:05:24.980 
and we're going to run this thing

00:05:24.980 --> 00:05:29.110 
and we're going to run this thing

delay<00:05:29.479> just<00:05:29.840> so<00:05:29.960> you<00:05:30.050> can<00:05:30.200> kind<00:05:30.410> of<00:05:30.530> see<00:05:31.040> how

00:05:31.210 --> 00:05:31.220 
delay just so you can kind of see how

00:05:31.220 --> 00:05:32.650 
delay just so you can kind of see how
this<00:05:31.400> would<00:05:31.580> be<00:05:31.610> used<00:05:32.000> by<00:05:32.150> some<00:05:32.510> of<00:05:32.540> the

00:05:32.650 --> 00:05:32.660 
this would be used by some of the

00:05:32.660 --> 00:05:35.980 
this would be used by some of the
ambient<00:05:33.110> textural<00:05:33.950> guitar<00:05:34.250> type<00:05:34.790> things<00:05:35.090> I

00:05:35.980 --> 00:05:35.990 
ambient textural guitar type things I

00:05:35.990 --> 00:05:37.780 
ambient textural guitar type things I
thought<00:05:36.560> it<00:05:36.650> was<00:05:36.770> a<00:05:36.800> very<00:05:37.040> cool<00:05:37.220> effect<00:05:37.340> so

00:05:37.780 --> 00:05:37.790 
thought it was a very cool effect so

00:05:37.790 --> 00:06:30.899 
thought it was a very cool effect so
here<00:05:37.970> you<00:05:38.030> go

00:06:30.899 --> 00:06:30.909

going<00:06:33.499> to<00:06:33.529> dial<00:06:33.740> the<00:06:33.889> thing<00:06:34.099> in<00:06:34.279> how<00:06:34.520> I

00:06:34.540 --> 00:06:34.550 
going to dial the thing in how I

00:06:34.550 --> 00:06:36.519 
going to dial the thing in how I
normally<00:06:35.300> will<00:06:35.809> leave<00:06:35.959> it<00:06:36.080> set<00:06:36.259> on<00:06:36.319> my

00:06:36.519 --> 00:06:36.529 
normally will leave it set on my

00:06:36.529 --> 00:06:38.199 
normally will leave it set on my
pedalboard<00:06:36.830> and<00:06:37.249> that's<00:06:37.369> mainly<00:06:37.639> just<00:06:37.969> for

00:06:38.199 --> 00:06:38.209 
pedalboard and that's mainly just for

00:06:38.209 --> 00:06:39.760 
pedalboard and that's mainly just for
some<00:06:38.419> coloration<00:06:38.839> on<00:06:39.110> clean<00:06:39.439> tones

00:06:39.760 --> 00:06:39.770 
some coloration on clean tones

00:06:39.770 --> 00:06:41.109 
some coloration on clean tones
especially<00:06:40.490> when<00:06:40.610> I'm<00:06:40.699> doing<00:06:40.729> really

00:06:41.109 --> 00:06:41.119 
especially when I'm doing really

00:06:41.119 --> 00:06:43.059 
especially when I'm doing really
percussive<00:06:41.719> work<00:06:41.929> you<00:06:42.469> can<00:06:42.649> dial<00:06:42.860> this<00:06:43.009> thing

00:06:43.059 --> 00:06:43.069 
percussive work you can dial this thing

00:06:43.069 --> 00:06:45.010 
percussive work you can dial this thing
in<00:06:43.369> to<00:06:43.520> where<00:06:43.669> your<00:06:44.149> guitar<00:06:44.449> almost<00:06:44.779> sounds

00:06:45.010 --> 00:06:45.020 
in to where your guitar almost sounds

00:06:45.020 --> 00:06:46.419 
in to where your guitar almost sounds
like<00:06:45.050> a<00:06:45.139> drum<00:06:45.499> especially<00:06:46.129> when<00:06:46.279> you're<00:06:46.399> just

00:06:46.419 --> 00:06:46.429 
like a drum especially when you're just

00:06:46.429 --> 00:06:47.799 
like a drum especially when you're just
kind<00:06:46.729> of<00:06:46.789> chucking<00:06:47.179> on<00:06:47.270> the<00:06:47.389> strings<00:06:47.629> a<00:06:47.779> little

00:06:47.799 --> 00:06:47.809 
kind of chucking on the strings a little

00:06:47.809 --> 00:06:49.899 
kind of chucking on the strings a little
bit<00:06:48.139> in<00:06:49.069> the<00:06:49.159> middle<00:06:49.279> of<00:06:49.429> this<00:06:49.520> clip<00:06:49.789> I'll

00:06:49.899 --> 00:06:49.909 
bit in the middle of this clip I'll

00:06:49.909 --> 00:06:51.790 
bit in the middle of this clip I'll
actually<00:06:50.089> turn<00:06:50.449> the<00:06:50.899> pedal<00:06:51.139> off<00:06:51.289> so<00:06:51.589> that<00:06:51.619> you

00:06:51.790 --> 00:06:51.800 
actually turn the pedal off so that you

00:06:51.800 --> 00:06:54.549 
actually turn the pedal off so that you
can<00:06:51.979> hear<00:06:52.659> right<00:06:53.659> in<00:06:53.809> sequence<00:06:54.259> what<00:06:54.469> it

00:06:54.549 --> 00:06:54.559 
can hear right in sequence what it

00:06:54.559 --> 00:06:56.260 
can hear right in sequence what it
sounds<00:06:54.860> like<00:06:54.979> without<00:06:55.129> it<00:06:55.339> and<00:06:55.729> then<00:06:55.909> how<00:06:56.149> much

00:06:56.260 --> 00:06:56.270 
sounds like without it and then how much

00:06:56.270 --> 00:06:57.939 
sounds like without it and then how much
cooler<00:06:56.659> it<00:06:56.839> sounds<00:06:57.139> with<00:06:57.289> it<00:06:57.319> on<00:06:57.469> at<00:06:57.649> least<00:06:57.740> in

00:06:57.939 --> 00:06:57.949 
cooler it sounds with it on at least in

00:06:57.949 --> 00:07:00.070 
cooler it sounds with it on at least in
my<00:06:58.069> opinion<00:06:58.429> so<00:06:58.659> hope<00:06:59.659> you've<00:06:59.839> enjoyed
