00:01:46.470 --> 00:01:48.740 
was thinking honestly if yall which
Charizard<00:01:47.040> was<00:01:47.729> the<00:01:47.850> one<00:01:48.030> I<00:01:48.210> think<00:01:48.509> it<00:01:48.659> was

00:01:48.740 --> 00:01:48.750 
Charizard was the one I think it was

00:01:48.750 --> 00:01:51.319 
Charizard was the one I think it was
Charizard<00:01:49.200> X<00:01:49.380> that<00:01:49.860> was<00:01:50.159> the<00:01:50.310> dragon<00:01:50.790> one<00:01:50.939> so<00:01:51.299> I

00:01:51.319 --> 00:01:51.329 
Charizard X that was the dragon one so I

00:01:51.329 --> 00:01:53.569 
Charizard X that was the dragon one so I
don't<00:01:51.659> even<00:01:51.780> think<00:01:51.930> it<00:01:52.350> mattered<00:01:52.799> that<00:01:52.829> I<00:01:53.220> went

00:01:53.569 --> 00:01:53.579 
don't even think it mattered that I went

00:01:53.579 --> 00:01:55.880 
don't even think it mattered that I went
into<00:01:53.960> Ambrose<00:01:54.960> because<00:01:55.380> he's<00:01:55.500> now<00:01:55.619> part

00:01:55.880 --> 00:01:55.890 
into Ambrose because he's now part

00:01:55.890 --> 00:01:58.490 
into Ambrose because he's now part
flying<00:01:56.250> I<00:01:56.430> think<00:01:56.640> he's<00:01:56.729> fire<00:01:57.210> dragon<00:01:57.990> so

00:01:58.490 --> 00:01:58.500

was fearing that he'd psychic me and

00:02:54.730 --> 00:02:57.119 
was fearing that he'd psychic me and
obviously<00:02:55.359> psychic<00:02:55.900> i<00:02:56.049> probably<00:02:56.409> can't<00:02:56.799> take

00:02:57.119 --> 00:02:57.129 
obviously psychic i probably can't take

00:02:57.129 --> 00:02:59.939 
obviously psychic i probably can't take
so<00:02:57.599> no<00:02:58.599> he's<00:02:58.810> gonna<00:02:58.989> be<00:02:59.079> calm<00:02:59.379> minding<00:02:59.829> i

00:03:06.539 --> 00:03:06.549 
as he didn't have Shadow Ball or I guess

00:03:06.549 --> 00:03:09.599 
as he didn't have Shadow Ball or I guess
a<00:03:07.060> fire<00:03:07.359> move<00:03:07.659> I<00:03:07.870> was<00:03:08.019> okay<00:03:08.260> some<00:03:09.069> reason<00:03:09.459> I'm
