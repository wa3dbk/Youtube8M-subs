how I I fell off of that seeing that

00:04:06.110 --> 00:04:09.040 
how I I fell off of that seeing that
squats<00:04:06.560> are<00:04:06.860> are<00:04:07.190> a<00:04:07.250> pretty<00:04:08.030> pretty<00:04:08.870> high

00:04:09.040 --> 00:04:09.050

the<00:04:12.320> morning<00:04:12.530> like<00:04:12.590> 5am<00:04:12.980> so<00:04:13.370> we'll<00:04:14.209> go<00:04:14.360> ahead

00:04:14.380 --> 00:04:14.390
