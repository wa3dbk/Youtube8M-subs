00:00:03.980 --> 00:00:10.200
 at the fracastoro hospital of san bonifacio 

00:00:06.210 --> 00:00:12.750
 the new four-legged dogs used 

00:00:10.200 --> 00:00:15.240
 they come into contact with pet therapy 

00:00:12.750 --> 00:00:17.850
 with oncology patients 

00:00:15.240 --> 00:00:20.730
 the intent is to prevent and 

00:00:17.850 --> 00:00:23.519
 reduce therapy anxiety 

00:00:20.730 --> 00:00:26.699
 the company decided through the 

00:00:23.519 --> 00:00:29.730
 veterinary service to offer to 

00:00:26.699 --> 00:00:32.059
 patients following the cycle of 

00:00:29.730 --> 00:00:36.059
 chemotherapy 

00:00:32.059 --> 00:00:37.940
 an opportunity to decrease the status of 

00:00:36.059 --> 00:00:40.590
 tension that this type of therapy 

00:00:37.940 --> 00:00:43.290
 understandably involves among other things 

00:00:40.590 --> 00:00:45.780
 these are therapy cycles that are 

00:00:43.290 --> 00:00:48.390
 rather long in time then the 

00:00:45.780 --> 00:00:50.640
 Exposure level of anxiety 

00:00:48.390 --> 00:00:53.969
 patient as long as he is doing this 

00:00:50.640 --> 00:00:55.670
 of intervention is remarkable to have these 

00:00:53.969 --> 00:00:58.789
 trained dogs 

00:00:55.670 --> 00:01:01.149
 waiting room allows you to think of 

00:00:58.789 --> 00:01:03.890
 other and to have an interaction of 

00:01:01.149 --> 00:01:05.930
 affectivity that turned out to be very 

00:01:03.890 --> 00:01:06.770
 welcome to the first surveys that 

00:01:05.930 --> 00:01:08.930
 we have done 

00:01:06.770 --> 00:01:11.060
 what a caress means to you 

00:01:08.930 --> 00:01:14.600
 waiting for therapy 

00:01:11.060 --> 00:01:18.920
 I think it's a fundamental thing for 

00:01:14.600 --> 00:01:21.770
 a patient indeed a little is a pleasure 

00:01:18.920 --> 00:01:23.299
 they are gestures of attention for us that not 

00:01:21.770 --> 00:01:27.080
 are to be underestimated 

00:01:23.299 --> 00:01:29.750
 they are beautiful they are flea rosie they are from 

00:01:27.080 --> 00:01:34.549
 crumpling very satisfied because 

00:01:29.750 --> 00:01:37.280
 are doubtful 2 very nice little animals and 

00:01:34.549 --> 00:01:39.140
 I've always been insured for dogs 

00:01:37.280 --> 00:01:41.299
 this initiative was accepted with 

00:01:39.140 --> 00:01:43.640
 extreme enthusiasm concerns us 

00:01:41.299 --> 00:01:45.709
 we absolutely however also wanted 

00:01:43.640 --> 00:01:47.869
 document this enthusiasm with gods 

00:01:45.709 --> 00:01:49.880
 questionnaires we have done so far in 

00:01:47.869 --> 00:01:51.890
 questionnaire in 16 patients because they are 

00:01:49.880 --> 00:01:53.929
 came twice only and all 

00:01:51.890 --> 00:01:55.909
 patients said that dogs are 

00:01:53.929 --> 00:01:58.280
 been useful for socializing with others 

00:01:55.909 --> 00:01:59.630
 people to accept therapies better 

00:01:58.280 --> 00:02:01.250
 which was one of our principals 

00:01:59.630 --> 00:02:03.890
 goals to spend moments 

00:02:01.250 --> 00:02:05.719
 we also like this very much 

00:02:03.890 --> 00:02:06.530
 because generally in oncology at the moments 

00:02:05.719 --> 00:02:09.200
 pleasant 

00:02:06.530 --> 00:02:11.180
 not many all believe that the 

00:02:09.200 --> 00:02:13.040
 presence of the animal the department that has 

00:02:11.180 --> 00:02:16.590
 brought joy 

00:02:13.040 --> 00:02:21.000
 everyone judges as very good excellent 

00:02:16.590 --> 00:02:22.920
 preparation of the team involved everyone 

00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:25.290
 wish to continue this 

00:02:22.920 --> 00:02:26.819
 experience and suggestions as there 

00:02:25.290 --> 00:02:29.430
 they ask that they come for several days to 

00:02:26.819 --> 00:02:31.349
 week and here we are working on it 

00:02:29.430 --> 00:02:33.630
 and then they also asked us which dogs 

00:02:31.349 --> 00:02:35.670
 can enter this therapy room 

00:02:33.630 --> 00:02:38.400
 instead it will not be possible because the room 

00:02:35.670 --> 00:02:40.319
 therapy in a protected environment and also the 

00:02:38.400 --> 00:02:41.879
 nurses entering the uniforms 

00:02:40.319 --> 00:02:44.549
 particular so it will be difficult 

00:02:41.879 --> 00:02:45.930
 introduce the dog however I believe that everything 

00:02:44.549 --> 00:02:47.190
 the rest we certainly succeed to 

00:02:45.930 --> 00:02:49.260
 please them 

00:02:47.190 --> 00:02:52.230
 but these dogs realize they are doing 

00:02:49.260 --> 00:02:53.989
 part of the therapy are center dogs 

00:02:52.230 --> 00:02:55.799
 students' pet therapy are 

00:02:53.989 --> 00:02:58.140
 selected and prepared 

00:02:55.799 --> 00:03:00.660
 they follow a health protocol that 

00:02:58.140 --> 00:03:03.329
 It guarantees the security of their their 

00:03:00.660 --> 00:03:06.180
 presence here, however, play theirs 

00:03:03.329 --> 00:03:07.620
 activity in complete spontaneity and foundation 

00:03:06.180 --> 00:03:08.250
 tour alessia this is the most thing 

00:03:07.620 --> 00:03:10.829
 important 

00:03:08.250 --> 00:03:13.260
 four-legged friends have many 

00:03:10.829 --> 00:03:16.440
 peculiarity also speaks of dogs that 

00:03:13.260 --> 00:03:19.709
 they smell the tumor and there are many 

00:03:16.440 --> 00:03:23.670
 experiments on the subject they seek to 

00:03:19.709 --> 00:03:26.310
 prove it also the company ul20a un 

00:03:23.670 --> 00:03:28.920
 objective a study program 

00:03:26.310 --> 00:03:31.430
 yes we started with this project 

00:03:28.920 --> 00:03:33.989
 project that is currently focused 

00:03:31.430 --> 00:03:36.450
 on patient anxiety and stress 

00:03:33.989 --> 00:03:38.970
 live during therapies and we will demonstrate 

00:03:36.450 --> 00:03:40.799
 how much dogs can help us ours 

00:03:38.970 --> 00:03:42.569
 goal, however, to expand the 

00:03:40.799 --> 00:03:44.720
 project is to gather in a future 

00:03:42.569 --> 00:03:47.160
 also objective data to be able to then 

00:03:44.720 --> 00:03:48.329
 also export nationally but 

00:03:47.160 --> 00:03:50.970
 just from belacqua of good idea is 

00:03:48.329 --> 00:03:53.010
 this one here and I'm really not 

00:03:50.970 --> 00:03:56.030
 thinking of bad things, yes 

00:03:53.010 --> 00:04:00.829
 focus on beautiful things and then 

00:03:56.030 --> 00:04:00.829
 helps helps to heal surely
