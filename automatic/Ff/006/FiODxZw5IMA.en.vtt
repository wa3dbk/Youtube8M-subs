00:00:00.260 --> 00:00:05.480
 good afternoon friends today we are with you 

00:00:02.510 --> 00:00:08.630
 let's see this phone from lenovo 

00:00:05.480 --> 00:00:12.889
 lenovo s930 

00:00:08.630 --> 00:00:12.889
 comes in such a box 

00:00:13.219 --> 00:00:17.430
 standard already somewhere long god here 

00:00:16.590 --> 00:00:20.220
 such an inscription 

00:00:17.430 --> 00:00:22.970
 long and probably pretty good 

00:00:20.220 --> 00:00:28.590
 sound let's see what we have 

00:00:22.970 --> 00:00:37.320
 picking picking we have ourselves 

00:00:28.590 --> 00:00:41.210
 phone phone 6 inch and shovel 

00:00:37.320 --> 00:00:44.489
 of course so pretty decent 

00:00:41.210 --> 00:00:49.800
 first impression is pretty 

00:00:44.489 --> 00:00:53.340
 lightweight it weighs about 170 grams for 

00:00:49.800 --> 00:00:56.309
 six inches tablet but this 

00:00:53.340 --> 00:00:59.460
 really quite light weight 

00:00:56.309 --> 00:01:04.530
 phone made new series 

00:00:59.460 --> 00:01:07.500
 phone bait x such a rough 

00:01:04.530 --> 00:01:14.130
 polycarbonate sadece pseudo metal 

00:01:07.500 --> 00:01:16.590
 insert let’s see what's in 

00:01:14.130 --> 00:01:21.360
 the package is likely to turn on the phone 

00:01:16.590 --> 00:01:23.220
 let him turn us on and see what 

00:01:21.360 --> 00:01:25.200
 we still have bundled both 

00:01:23.220 --> 00:01:32.070
 the usual instruction here 

00:01:25.200 --> 00:01:34.920
 excellent all kinds of sound sound loud 

00:01:32.070 --> 00:01:37.549
 and and at once distinct such here it is 

00:01:34.920 --> 00:01:44.310
 really gorgeous loud sound 

00:01:37.549 --> 00:01:50.070
 adapter charging cable micro and screeching 

00:01:44.310 --> 00:01:51.010
 and headphones of this quality headphones 

00:01:50.070 --> 00:01:53.400
 let's get a look 

00:01:51.010 --> 00:01:55.750
 we only have high-quality headphones 

00:01:53.400 --> 00:01:59.170
 headphones vacuum up pretty 

00:01:55.750 --> 00:02:04.450
 good quality probably will 

00:01:59.170 --> 00:02:09.780
 headphones phone phone is built on 

00:02:04.450 --> 00:02:17.100
 new processor mtk 6582 

00:02:09.780 --> 00:02:22.540
 4 cores with a frequency of 300 megahertz food 

00:02:17.100 --> 00:02:25.180
 very good result in antutu somewhere 

00:02:22.540 --> 00:02:26.580
 gives this phone a present for 17 thousand 

00:02:25.180 --> 00:02:33.400
 points 

00:02:26.580 --> 00:02:36.960
 firmware firmware like everything in 

00:02:33.400 --> 00:02:47.110
 principle normally gasified 

00:02:36.960 --> 00:02:52.900
 firmware is pretty good and great 

00:02:47.110 --> 00:02:56.370
 firmware issues like there is no processor 

00:02:52.900 --> 00:03:01.350
 already said ozu here one gigabyte 

00:02:56.370 --> 00:03:04.720
 8 gigabyte phone memory 

00:03:01.350 --> 00:03:07.660
 screen screen of course screen of course 

00:03:04.720 --> 00:03:12.250
 chic and and how much I 

00:03:07.660 --> 00:03:15.250
 understand judging because I see not here 

00:03:12.250 --> 00:03:18.519
 air gap and so here's the screen 

00:03:15.250 --> 00:03:21.700
 like a bud a little thinner and closer 

00:03:18.519 --> 00:03:25.989
 is like a surface but 

00:03:21.700 --> 00:03:29.220
 Naturally, he has resolution of him hd 1280 

00:03:25.989 --> 00:03:33.489
 at 720 points 

00:03:29.220 --> 00:03:36.340
 the camera has a front camera on 16 

00:03:33.489 --> 00:03:40.420
 megapixels have the phone back 

00:03:36.340 --> 00:03:44.220
 8 megapixel camera with flash and 

00:03:40.420 --> 00:03:47.019
 autofocus on something great camera 

00:03:44.220 --> 00:03:48.819
 practical interface that is all 

00:03:47.019 --> 00:03:51.379
 possible 

00:03:48.819 --> 00:03:54.110
 bluetooth wifi gps 

00:03:51.379 --> 00:03:54.940
 under this radio is all this 

00:03:54.110 --> 00:03:57.739
 present 

00:03:54.940 --> 00:04:00.640
 great battery with this here 

00:03:57.739 --> 00:04:03.590
 lightweight great battery on 

00:04:00.640 --> 00:04:07.400
 3000 milliampere number with thickness 

00:04:03.590 --> 00:04:10.390
 phone only 8 point 65 

00:04:07.400 --> 00:04:12.830
 millimeter and 

00:04:10.390 --> 00:04:18.769
 say of course that this is pure 

00:04:12.830 --> 00:04:22.880
 phone is probably quite difficult though 

00:04:18.769 --> 00:04:27.310
 despite here is 6 inches then the apparatus 

00:04:22.880 --> 00:04:30.970
 look much more compact than some 

00:04:27.310 --> 00:04:38.720
 7 inch tablets and 

00:04:30.970 --> 00:04:40.850
 principle like this with good 

00:04:38.720 --> 00:04:44.020
 sound with a good screen that is 

00:04:40.850 --> 00:04:47.840
 browse here of course here are the movies 

00:04:44.020 --> 00:04:48.820
 Well, the Internet will probably be very 

00:04:47.840 --> 00:04:53.110
 not bad 

00:04:48.820 --> 00:04:53.110
 Overall of course here is such a bast 

00:04:54.260 --> 00:05:03.180
 despite the fact that there are two cards on 

00:04:59.790 --> 00:05:09.390
 supports phone two cards and there is 

00:05:03.180 --> 00:05:12.750
 card memory expansion but probably 

00:05:09.390 --> 00:05:16.470
 how would I have positioned more 

00:05:12.750 --> 00:05:18.260
 the device is not like a phone probably because 

00:05:16.470 --> 00:05:21.200
 that all the same 

00:05:18.260 --> 00:05:24.930
 to apply this paw to fluff 

00:05:21.200 --> 00:05:28.080
 pretty as if I don’t really know 

00:05:24.930 --> 00:05:32.130
 to be more comfortable would be positioned 

00:05:28.080 --> 00:05:34.350
 This phone is probably like a tablet 6 

00:05:32.130 --> 00:05:37.260
 inch tablet which can 

00:05:34.350 --> 00:05:46.320
 compete with many 7 inch 

00:05:37.260 --> 00:05:47.550
 tablets and really with the ability to 

00:05:46.320 --> 00:05:50.430
 phone opportunity 

00:05:47.550 --> 00:05:52.410
 well here's a review we sort of do in principle 

00:05:50.430 --> 00:05:56.600
 we will not and what he wanted from his 

00:05:52.410 --> 00:05:56.600
 impressions i would tell you
