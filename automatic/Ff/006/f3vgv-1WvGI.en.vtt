to skip the batter into each tin so you

00:02:34.860 --> 00:02:36.710 
to skip the batter into each tin so you
can<00:02:35.040> see<00:02:35.190> three<00:02:35.490> skips<00:02:35.790> works<00:02:36.030> perfectly<00:02:36.510> for

00:02:36.710 --> 00:02:36.720 
can see three skips works perfectly for

this helps distribute the batter and it

00:02:46.110 --> 00:02:47.570 
this helps distribute the batter and it
also<00:02:46.260> ensures<00:02:46.500> that<00:02:46.830> you<00:02:46.890> don't<00:02:47.070> have<00:02:47.160> any<00:02:47.370> air
