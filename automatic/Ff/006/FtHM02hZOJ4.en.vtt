00:00:55.099 --> 00:00:55.109 
of looks flat and it's gonna start

00:00:55.109 --> 00:00:57.410 
of looks flat and it's gonna start
looking<00:00:55.469> greasy<00:00:55.920> so<00:00:56.550> once<00:00:56.760> you<00:00:56.910> spray<00:00:57.210> this

00:00:57.410 --> 00:00:57.420 
looking greasy so once you spray this

00:00:57.420 --> 00:00:59.779 
looking greasy so once you spray this
onto<00:00:57.690> your<00:00:57.930> roots<00:00:58.379> it<00:00:58.710> takes<00:00:58.949> out<00:00:59.250> all<00:00:59.489> of<00:00:59.579> that

00:00:59.779 --> 00:00:59.789 
onto your roots it takes out all of that

00:00:59.789 --> 00:01:02.779 
onto your roots it takes out all of that
grease<00:01:00.420> and<00:01:00.690> the<00:01:00.930> oil<00:01:01.140> and<00:01:01.590> it<00:01:02.370> leaves<00:01:02.550> it<00:01:02.670> with

00:01:02.779 --> 00:01:02.789 
grease and the oil and it leaves it with

00:01:02.789 --> 00:01:04.700 
grease and the oil and it leaves it with
a<00:01:02.820> really<00:01:03.149> nice<00:01:03.359> scent<00:01:03.719> and<00:01:04.019> it<00:01:04.199> gives<00:01:04.410> it<00:01:04.590> a

00:01:04.700 --> 00:01:04.710 
a really nice scent and it gives it a

00:01:04.710 --> 00:01:07.670 
a really nice scent and it gives it a
lot<00:01:04.949> of<00:01:04.980> volume<00:01:05.550> so<00:01:05.850> that's<00:01:06.630> pretty<00:01:06.810> much<00:01:06.900> what

00:01:07.670 --> 00:01:07.680 
lot of volume so that's pretty much what

00:01:07.680 --> 00:01:11.210 
lot of volume so that's pretty much what
a<00:01:07.740> dry<00:01:08.189> shampoo<00:01:08.460> does<00:01:09.240> it's<00:01:09.630> not<00:01:09.930> like<00:01:10.920> an

00:01:11.210 --> 00:01:11.220 
a dry shampoo does it's not like an

00:01:11.220 --> 00:01:13.640 
a dry shampoo does it's not like an
alternative<00:01:11.970> for<00:01:12.330> not<00:01:12.540> shampooing<00:01:13.290> your<00:01:13.470> hair

00:01:13.640 --> 00:01:13.650 
alternative for not shampooing your hair

00:01:13.650 --> 00:01:16.609 
alternative for not shampooing your hair
I<00:01:14.250> really<00:01:14.759> recommend<00:01:15.390> you<00:01:15.570> do<00:01:15.990> shampoo<00:01:16.439> your

00:01:16.609 --> 00:01:16.619 
I really recommend you do shampoo your

00:01:16.619 --> 00:01:20.719 
I really recommend you do shampoo your
hair<00:01:16.650> and<00:01:17.040> not<00:01:17.130> just<00:01:17.400> rely<00:01:17.790> on<00:01:17.820> this<00:01:19.220> but<00:01:20.220> it's

00:01:20.719 --> 00:01:20.729 
hair and not just rely on this but it's

00:01:20.729 --> 00:01:23.899 
hair and not just rely on this but it's
just<00:01:21.210> it<00:01:21.689> helps<00:01:22.320> you<00:01:22.680> so<00:01:22.920> that<00:01:23.130> you<00:01:23.579> don't<00:01:23.729> have

00:01:23.899 --> 00:01:23.909 
just it helps you so that you don't have

00:01:23.909 --> 00:01:25.940 
just it helps you so that you don't have
to<00:01:24.150> wash<00:01:24.390> your<00:01:24.420> hair<00:01:24.930> every<00:01:25.470> single<00:01:25.500> day

00:01:25.940 --> 00:01:25.950 
to wash your hair every single day

00:01:25.950 --> 00:01:27.890 
to wash your hair every single day
that's<00:01:26.369> already<00:01:26.670> bad<00:01:26.939> and<00:01:27.270> that<00:01:27.720> already

00:01:27.890 --> 00:01:27.900 
that's already bad and that already

00:01:27.900 --> 00:01:30.950 
that's already bad and that already
dries<00:01:28.200> out<00:01:28.320> your<00:01:28.380> hair<00:01:28.680> and<00:01:29.299> so<00:01:30.299> what<00:01:30.420> keratin

00:01:30.950 --> 00:01:30.960 
dries out your hair and so what keratin

00:01:30.960 --> 00:01:36.010 
dries out your hair and so what keratin
is<00:01:31.110> is<00:01:31.350> as<00:01:31.740> actually<00:01:32.460> fibers<00:01:33.329> of<00:01:33.689> protein<00:01:34.380> and

00:01:36.010 --> 00:01:36.020 
is is as actually fibers of protein and

00:01:36.020 --> 00:01:39.230 
is is as actually fibers of protein and
it<00:01:37.020> makes<00:01:37.500> up<00:01:37.710> the<00:01:37.740> outer<00:01:37.920> layer<00:01:38.430> of<00:01:38.700> our<00:01:38.880> skin

00:01:39.230 --> 00:01:39.240 
it makes up the outer layer of our skin

00:01:39.240 --> 00:01:41.600 
it makes up the outer layer of our skin
and<00:01:39.479> also<00:01:39.869> our<00:01:40.020> fingernails<00:01:40.500> and<00:01:40.740> also<00:01:41.460> our

00:01:41.600 --> 00:01:41.610 
and also our fingernails and also our

00:01:41.610 --> 00:01:45.109 
and also our fingernails and also our
hair<00:01:41.909> so<00:01:42.630> it's<00:01:43.079> kind<00:01:43.439> of<00:01:43.500> putting<00:01:43.860> back<00:01:44.579> more

00:01:45.109 --> 00:01:45.119 
hair so it's kind of putting back more

00:01:45.119 --> 00:01:48.260 
hair so it's kind of putting back more
protein<00:01:46.079> into<00:01:46.380> our<00:01:46.799> hair<00:01:47.040> which<00:01:47.490> is<00:01:47.520> good<00:01:47.969> our

00:01:48.260 --> 00:01:48.270 
protein into our hair which is good our

00:01:48.270 --> 00:01:50.120 
protein into our hair which is good our
hair<00:01:48.570> needs<00:01:48.869> more<00:01:49.290> protein

00:01:50.120 --> 00:01:50.130 
hair needs more protein

00:01:50.130 --> 00:01:54.770 
hair needs more protein
um<00:01:51.020> there's<00:01:52.020> also<00:01:52.229> a<00:01:52.500> different<00:01:53.189> suave<00:01:53.969> dry

00:01:54.770 --> 00:01:54.780

00:01:54.780 --> 00:01:56.539 
um there's also a different suave dry
shampoo<00:01:55.140> that<00:01:55.320> just<00:01:55.530> recently<00:01:55.710> came<00:01:56.009> out<00:01:56.369> at

the same time

00:01:57.420 --> 00:02:01.459 
the same time
um<00:01:57.619> but<00:01:58.619> it<00:01:59.549> isn't<00:02:00.270> both<00:02:00.509> keratin<00:02:01.079> one<00:02:01.229> and<00:02:01.409> I

um but it isn't both keratin one and I

00:02:01.469 --> 00:02:03.109 
um but it isn't both keratin one and I
kind<00:02:01.740> of<00:02:01.799> just<00:02:01.979> like<00:02:02.159> the<00:02:02.219> packaging<00:02:02.939> it's

00:02:03.109 --> 00:02:03.119 
kind of just like the packaging it's

00:02:03.119 --> 00:02:05.990

like<00:02:03.240> gold<00:02:03.600> and<00:02:04.140> sleek<00:02:04.710> and<00:02:05.219> I've<00:02:05.670> definitely

00:02:05.990 --> 00:02:06.000 
like gold and sleek and I've definitely

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:08.210 
like gold and sleek and I've definitely
heard<00:02:06.509> of<00:02:06.689> keratin<00:02:07.140> being<00:02:07.380> used<00:02:07.649> in<00:02:07.860> salons

00:02:08.210 --> 00:02:08.220 
heard of keratin being used in salons

00:02:08.220 --> 00:02:11.660 
heard of keratin being used in salons
before<00:02:08.910> so<00:02:09.810> the<00:02:10.500> fact<00:02:10.800> that<00:02:10.890> you<00:02:11.070> can<00:02:11.310> get<00:02:11.460> this

00:02:11.660 --> 00:02:11.670 
before so the fact that you can get this

00:02:11.670 --> 00:02:13.640 
before so the fact that you can get this
for<00:02:11.940> under<00:02:11.970> $4<00:02:12.870> is<00:02:13.140> pretty

00:02:13.640 --> 00:02:13.650 
for under $4 is pretty

make<00:04:46.470> sure<00:04:46.650> that<00:04:46.770> you're<00:04:46.919> only<00:04:47.100> getting<00:04:47.400> the

00:04:47.600 --> 00:04:47.610 
make sure that you're only getting the

00:04:47.610 --> 00:04:48.920 
make sure that you're only getting the
roots<00:04:47.789> of<00:04:47.940> your<00:04:48.030> hair<00:04:48.090> because<00:04:48.630> you<00:04:48.720> don't

00:04:48.920 --> 00:04:48.930 
roots of your hair because you don't

00:04:48.930 --> 00:04:52.879 
roots of your hair because you don't
want<00:04:49.110> to<00:04:49.200> get<00:04:49.460> watches<00:04:50.510> and<00:04:51.510> your<00:04:52.020> length<00:04:52.260> of

00:04:52.879 --> 00:04:52.889 
want to get watches and your length of

00:04:52.889 --> 00:05:01.159 
want to get watches and your length of
white<00:04:53.250> if<00:04:53.610> you<00:04:53.940> get<00:04:54.120> too<00:04:54.330> close<00:04:59.750> and<00:05:00.750> again

00:05:01.159 --> 00:05:01.169 
white if you get too close and again

00:05:01.169 --> 00:05:09.590 
white if you get too close and again
you're<00:05:01.410> just<00:05:01.440> gonna<00:05:02.930> shake<00:05:03.930> everything<00:05:08.600> and

00:05:09.590 --> 00:05:09.600 
you're just gonna shake everything and

00:05:09.600 --> 00:05:12.920 
you're just gonna shake everything and
then<00:05:09.750> I'm<00:05:09.840> gonna<00:05:09.990> go<00:05:10.229> ahead<00:05:10.380> and<00:05:10.530> do<00:05:11.720> just<00:05:12.720> one

00:05:12.920 --> 00:05:12.930 
then I'm gonna go ahead and do just one

00:05:12.930 --> 00:05:20.080 
then I'm gonna go ahead and do just one
more<00:05:12.960> near<00:05:13.410> the<00:05:13.590> roots

00:05:20.080 --> 00:05:20.090 

00:05:20.090 --> 00:05:34.469 

I<00:05:21.370> probably<00:05:22.370> look<00:05:22.639> crazy<00:05:23.030> let's<00:05:23.810> see

00:05:34.469 --> 00:05:34.479 

00:05:34.479 --> 00:05:38.700 

so<00:05:35.259> look<00:05:36.189> I<00:05:36.580> mean<00:05:36.849> I<00:05:37.210> have<00:05:37.569> a<00:05:37.599> lot<00:05:37.990> more<00:05:38.020> volume

00:05:38.700 --> 00:05:38.710 
so look I mean I have a lot more volume

00:05:38.710 --> 00:05:41.879 
so look I mean I have a lot more volume
in<00:05:38.860> my<00:05:39.009> hair<00:05:39.039> than<00:05:39.490> they<00:05:39.610> did<00:05:40.499> and<00:05:41.499> then<00:05:41.620> if<00:05:41.770> you

00:05:41.879 --> 00:05:41.889 
in my hair than they did and then if you

00:05:41.889 --> 00:05:44.670 
in my hair than they did and then if you
do<00:05:42.099> what<00:05:42.309> you<00:05:42.460> can<00:05:42.639> brush<00:05:43.139> brush<00:05:44.139> some<00:05:44.409> of<00:05:44.529> it

00:05:44.670 --> 00:05:44.680 
do what you can brush brush some of it

00:05:44.680 --> 00:05:46.709 
do what you can brush brush some of it
out<00:05:44.860> so<00:05:44.889> it's<00:05:45.370> kind<00:05:45.639> of<00:05:45.669> distributes<00:05:46.330> a<00:05:46.479> little

00:05:46.709 --> 00:05:46.719 
out so it's kind of distributes a little

00:05:46.719 --> 00:05:50.939 
out so it's kind of distributes a little
bit<00:05:46.839> more<00:05:46.990> even<00:05:47.319> but<00:05:48.150> it's<00:05:49.150> not<00:05:49.419> like<00:05:49.719> much<00:05:50.169> but

00:05:50.939 --> 00:05:50.949 
bit more even but it's not like much but

00:05:50.949 --> 00:05:52.559 
bit more even but it's not like much but
I<00:05:50.979> didn't<00:05:51.370> really<00:05:51.550> have<00:05:51.789> a<00:05:51.849> lot<00:05:52.210> of<00:05:52.240> what<00:05:52.509> we

00:05:52.559 --> 00:05:52.569 
I didn't really have a lot of what we

00:05:52.569 --> 00:05:55.860 
I didn't really have a lot of what we
hold<00:05:52.779> in<00:05:52.900> my<00:05:53.050> hair<00:05:53.199> to<00:05:53.379> begin<00:05:53.559> with<00:05:53.919> so<00:05:54.779> but<00:05:55.779> you

00:05:55.860 --> 00:05:55.870 
hold in my hair to begin with so but you

00:05:55.870 --> 00:05:58.769 
hold in my hair to begin with so but you
can<00:05:55.900> definitely<00:05:56.169> tell<00:05:57.069> that<00:05:57.550> it<00:05:58.059> did<00:05:58.419> get<00:05:58.629> like

00:05:58.769 --> 00:05:58.779 
can definitely tell that it did get like

00:05:58.779 --> 00:06:02.790 
can definitely tell that it did get like
a<00:05:58.900> boost<00:05:59.229> of<00:06:00.089> volume<00:06:01.089> and<00:06:01.870> it<00:06:02.199> does<00:06:02.379> take<00:06:02.620> out

00:06:02.790 --> 00:06:02.800 
a boost of volume and it does take out

00:06:02.800 --> 00:06:05.129 
a boost of volume and it does take out
the<00:06:02.979> oils<00:06:03.279> if<00:06:03.400> you<00:06:03.490> have<00:06:03.639> oil<00:06:03.849> and<00:06:04.389> I<00:06:04.569> know<00:06:04.779> for
