00:00:01.129 --> 00:00:05.700
 hello good these guys that such 

00:00:03.410 --> 00:00:08.010
 Welcome to my channel one more day as 

00:00:05.700 --> 00:00:10.680
 You see today I bring you a new guide of 

00:00:08.010 --> 00:00:13.350
 trade or in this case I have decided 

00:00:10.680 --> 00:00:14.730
 do it from bundesliga players and os 

00:00:13.350 --> 00:00:16.019
 I will bring another five examples of 

00:00:14.730 --> 00:00:18.420
 players that can be good for 

00:00:16.019 --> 00:00:20.880
 attract at first the first one we're going 

00:00:18.420 --> 00:00:23.220
 to see is sokratis the new defense 

00:00:20.880 --> 00:00:24.119
 central of borussia of dortmund and me 

00:00:23.220 --> 00:00:25.980
 I think it's going to be one of the most 

00:00:24.119 --> 00:00:28.670
 used this year in Bundesliga with 

00:00:25.980 --> 00:00:31.890
 that 77 rhythm I believe and it will be the couple 

00:00:28.670 --> 00:00:35.540
 that will accompany felipe santana this 

00:00:31.890 --> 00:00:38.460
 year in fifa 14 in the bundesliga teams 

00:00:35.540 --> 00:00:41.760
 77 of pace with motive 81 defense plus 

00:00:38.460 --> 00:00:44.220
 a player is very tall a player who already 

00:00:41.760 --> 00:00:46.530
 last year I tried the swift and it was very 

00:00:44.220 --> 00:00:48.510
 well and I think that this year I think that 

00:00:46.530 --> 00:00:50.040
 It's going to be very good too and I think that 

00:00:48.510 --> 00:00:52.230
 principle many people will not know 

00:00:50.040 --> 00:00:54.360
 you will see that the Greek will say and this kind of 

00:00:52.230 --> 00:00:55.829
 olive waves and almost pay attention to me 

00:00:54.360 --> 00:00:58.200
 this is going to be a good player to take out 

00:00:55.829 --> 00:01:01.230
 coins at the beginning about all the 

00:00:58.200 --> 00:01:03.899
 next that we are going to analyze is marko 

00:01:01.230 --> 00:01:06.340
 Arnautovic in this player is already the year 

00:01:03.899 --> 00:01:09.609
 past was very good you know 

00:01:06.340 --> 00:01:11.439
 had a lot of strength was quickie and what 

00:01:09.609 --> 00:01:14.530
 bad that this year he has put md 

00:01:11.439 --> 00:01:18.069
 but that was analyzing the md is that 

00:01:14.530 --> 00:01:21.280
 there is someone there is stealing very expensive that 

00:01:18.069 --> 00:01:23.020
 It was surely price and there is not much 

00:01:21.280 --> 00:01:24.459
 more then that I recommend you 

00:01:23.020 --> 00:01:25.899
 File this type of equipment for people 

00:01:24.459 --> 00:01:26.920
 that team is made to bundesliga to 

00:01:25.899 --> 00:01:28.329
 robben from the beginning will not have 

00:01:26.920 --> 00:01:29.560
 then what happens is going to have to put 

00:01:28.329 --> 00:01:31.899
 arnautovic who is a very good player 

00:01:29.560 --> 00:01:35.319
 that has a good state apart that 

00:01:31.899 --> 00:01:37.000
 is a non-brilliant player I assure you 

00:01:35.319 --> 00:01:38.979
 that this player is going to give a lot 

00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:41.649
 coins and trade eyes with him because he's going to 

00:01:38.979 --> 00:01:45.369
 be very wanted the next player that 

00:01:41.649 --> 00:01:47.020
 let's look is the one already this player is 

00:01:45.369 --> 00:01:49.989
 characterized by having five stars of 

00:01:47.020 --> 00:01:52.539
 filigree has a very high rhythm and what 

00:01:49.989 --> 00:01:54.579
 happens in his band who is frank ribery 

00:01:52.539 --> 00:01:57.219
 who has coins for frank ribery at 

00:01:54.579 --> 00:01:59.020
 very few people start so 

00:01:57.219 --> 00:02:01.599
 I recommend that you try this player 

00:01:59.020 --> 00:02:03.219
 that those five are probably very good 

00:02:01.599 --> 00:02:05.409
 Filigree stars will also help 

00:02:03.219 --> 00:02:07.569
 to be looked for quite as it is expensive 

00:02:05.409 --> 00:02:09.310
 at the beginning and that many people do not 

00:02:07.569 --> 00:02:10.390
 keep in mind when trying and 

00:02:09.310 --> 00:02:12.650
 be a player 

00:02:10.390 --> 00:02:14.540
 to deal with him 

00:02:12.650 --> 00:02:16.459
 the next player we're going to see is 

00:02:14.540 --> 00:02:19.189
 the center forward 

00:02:16.459 --> 00:02:21.590
 this year I was already very gifted I was very 

00:02:19.189 --> 00:02:23.420
 Copado was brilliant that made a lot of 

00:02:21.590 --> 00:02:25.670
 people had it this year of the dream 

00:02:23.420 --> 00:02:28.939
 bright what will happen if at the beginning 

00:02:25.670 --> 00:02:31.069
 like everything like all people who want 

00:02:28.939 --> 00:02:34.159
 fast teams that wants equipment that 

00:02:31.069 --> 00:02:36.109
 be competitive to climb fast from 

00:02:34.159 --> 00:02:37.549
 divisions because this is going to be one of the 

00:02:36.109 --> 00:02:39.439
 most wanted players forward 

00:02:37.549 --> 00:02:41.959
 center of the bundesliga I think that 

00:02:39.439 --> 00:02:44.750
 has a good one of 88 of rhythm 70 

00:02:41.959 --> 00:02:47.209
 of shooting is not bad 84 of the header 

00:02:44.750 --> 00:02:49.400
 apart that was strong today and this year not 

00:02:47.209 --> 00:02:51.500
 I know how it will be in fifa 14 honestly 

00:02:49.400 --> 00:02:54.620
 but he looks good he 's a player 

00:02:51.500 --> 00:02:56.239
 It will be not weird and as you can see this face 

00:02:54.620 --> 00:02:58.340
 pretty much everything I think is going to be able 

00:02:56.239 --> 00:03:00.260
 deal pretty well with him 

00:02:58.340 --> 00:03:03.260
 and the last player we're going to see today 

00:03:00.260 --> 00:03:06.410
 He is the new player of Borussia 

00:03:03.260 --> 00:03:09.019
 dortmund mkhitaryan does not pronounce well 

00:03:06.410 --> 00:03:11.900
 sincerely because in that Armenian in 

00:03:09.019 --> 00:03:14.209
 has a very strange name you have that 

00:03:11.900 --> 00:03:17.930
 I have been very good the truth that they have 

00:03:14.209 --> 00:03:19.250
 impressed 80 of rhythm 78 shot of 

00:03:17.930 --> 00:03:21.260
 more that has four leg stars 

00:03:19.250 --> 00:03:23.180
 bad and four filigree stars I 

00:03:21.260 --> 00:03:24.650
 I think it may be the surprise I have 

00:03:23.180 --> 00:03:28.040
 very much desire to try this player 

00:03:24.650 --> 00:03:30.470
 and many people to see it when they see that it has 

00:03:28.040 --> 00:03:33.380
 that country is so weird I think it's going to 

00:03:30.470 --> 00:03:36.519
 go to look for the cars to players of 

00:03:33.380 --> 00:03:38.480
 that style will be more expensive and that 

00:03:36.519 --> 00:03:40.579
 Surely we will have this baratillo 

00:03:38.480 --> 00:03:42.200
 player and we can get quite 

00:03:40.579 --> 00:03:44.150
 benefit of the addition that has good 

00:03:42.200 --> 00:03:47.090
 pint I think it's going to be a crack of 

00:03:44.150 --> 00:03:48.610
 this year in fifa 14 for nothing this has 

00:03:47.090 --> 00:03:51.860
 been all for today's players 

00:03:48.610 --> 00:03:54.709
 bundesliga the next episode I do not know if 

00:03:51.860 --> 00:03:56.239
 would bring you all-in-one and nothing if 

00:03:54.709 --> 00:03:59.360

00:03:59.360 --> 00:04:03.079
 liked subscribed salinas if it's not already
