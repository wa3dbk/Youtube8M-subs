00:00:00.520 --> 00:00:06.100
 good and we continue in 3 and now we're 

00:00:02.939 --> 00:00:07.899
 on the bus of electronic arts in i 

00:00:06.100 --> 00:00:10.360
 esports we are with sebastián enrique 

00:00:07.899 --> 00:00:12.279
 leading producer of fifa 14 for this 

00:00:10.360 --> 00:00:14.080
 generation of consoles and now that we 

00:00:12.279 --> 00:00:16.029
 has an Argentine who is working 

00:00:14.080 --> 00:00:17.320
 in a larger company in the world 

00:00:16.029 --> 00:00:18.940
 development of the games sebastian 

00:00:17.320 --> 00:00:21.400
 thanks for the interview you can give us 

00:00:18.940 --> 00:00:23.770
 count of fifa 14 no thanks for coming 

00:00:21.400 --> 00:00:25.870
 I hope you are enjoying 3 fifa 

00:00:23.770 --> 00:00:28.090
 14 this year comes with everything in 

00:00:25.870 --> 00:00:30.100
 terms of gameplay and 4 changes very 

00:00:28.090 --> 00:00:32.469
 important that we are making one what 

00:00:30.100 --> 00:00:35.260
 that we call precision movement that what 

00:00:32.469 --> 00:00:37.780
 is that is to change how the 

00:00:35.260 --> 00:00:38.980
 players inside the field because if one 

00:00:37.780 --> 00:00:40.600
 is fixed in real life as the 

00:00:38.980 --> 00:00:42.910
 people move or change direction 

00:00:40.600 --> 00:00:44.710
 they always have one foot resting on the 

00:00:42.910 --> 00:00:46.270
 good land that did not happen in the 

00:00:44.710 --> 00:00:47.980
 games one sees and one can change from 

00:00:46.270 --> 00:00:49.780
 address at any time but 

00:00:47.980 --> 00:00:51.880
 good is a technology that we had is 

00:00:49.780 --> 00:00:53.290
 developing for two years now 

00:00:51.880 --> 00:00:55.329
 we incorporated into the game and really 

00:00:53.290 --> 00:00:57.820
 completely change the way you play 

00:00:55.329 --> 00:00:59.800
 because it also allows us to have the 

00:00:57.820 --> 00:01:01.750
 inertia of the players allows us 

00:00:59.800 --> 00:01:03.309
 have the acceleration and deceleration not 

00:01:01.750 --> 00:01:05.440
 it's the same if you want to accelerate I do not know 

00:01:03.309 --> 00:01:08.170
 how with messi that with 

00:01:05.440 --> 00:01:09.820
 puyol then there are many things that 

00:01:08.170 --> 00:01:11.710
 just a control war feels 

00:01:09.820 --> 00:01:14.620
 very different feels much more natural 

00:01:11.710 --> 00:01:17.080
 much more soccer and apart from that in 

00:01:14.620 --> 00:01:19.570
 definition terms what we change 

00:01:17.080 --> 00:01:21.820
 is how the arch is finished and not the 

00:01:19.570 --> 00:01:23.200
 mechanical but yes many more animations 

00:01:21.820 --> 00:01:25.270
 much more 

00:01:23.200 --> 00:01:27.310
 new types of shots and apart as 

00:01:25.270 --> 00:01:29.290
 players approach the ball and 

00:01:27.310 --> 00:01:31.720
 apart from that we rewrite everything that 

00:01:29.290 --> 00:01:33.280
 is the physics of the ball to have 

00:01:31.720 --> 00:01:34.870
 shots like we could not have 

00:01:33.280 --> 00:01:37.090
 before as the ronaldo Christian that 

00:01:34.870 --> 00:01:38.470
 does the zigzag but they are very many 

00:01:37.090 --> 00:01:40.300
 new trajectories that when one 

00:01:38.470 --> 00:01:41.620
 really makes the goals feel 

00:01:40.300 --> 00:01:44.590
 wonderful all goals are 

00:01:41.620 --> 00:01:46.120
 really different and apart from that other 

00:01:44.590 --> 00:01:48.310
 fundamental changes what we call 

00:01:46.120 --> 00:01:50.590
 protect the ball that is to protect the 

00:01:48.310 --> 00:01:52.720
 The ball is a new game mechanic that 

00:01:50.590 --> 00:01:54.610
 how do you see it, how do you like it? 

00:01:52.720 --> 00:01:56.410
 protects the ball using the good body 

00:01:54.610 --> 00:01:57.550
 that 's what they're going to be able to do 

00:01:56.410 --> 00:02:00.250
 matter moving in any 

00:01:57.550 --> 00:02:01.510
 address any speed can 

00:02:00.250 --> 00:02:03.430
 enter to protect the ball and what 

00:02:01.510 --> 00:02:05.620
 allows this is that one plays more a 

00:02:03.430 --> 00:02:08.050
 game of possession of the ball that is 

00:02:05.620 --> 00:02:09.670
 much more interesting and much more soccer 

00:02:08.050 --> 00:02:11.640
 in that sense that is nothing more than 

00:02:09.670 --> 00:02:14.850
 run arch bow all the time 

00:02:11.640 --> 00:02:16.380
 fantastic and good this franchise that a 

00:02:14.850 --> 00:02:19.140
 world level is growing day by day and 

00:02:16.380 --> 00:02:22.020
 every time it is like staying with the subject 

00:02:19.140 --> 00:02:24.870
 of football the truth that other news 

00:02:22.020 --> 00:02:26.040
 you can give us around fifa apart 

00:02:24.870 --> 00:02:28.440
 of game mechanics pretty much 

00:02:26.040 --> 00:02:30.600
 era how will you get to the 

00:02:28.440 --> 00:02:32.760
 Argentina licenses all that can be 

00:02:30.600 --> 00:02:35.160
 count the release is going to be late 

00:02:32.760 --> 00:02:37.560
 September is September 27 in 

00:02:35.160 --> 00:02:39.750
 europe and on September 24 more or less 

00:02:37.560 --> 00:02:41.450
 in North America and Latin America is such 

00:02:39.750 --> 00:02:42.980
 between those dates 

00:02:41.450 --> 00:02:45.680
 apart from made the issue of licenses 

00:02:42.980 --> 00:02:47.569
 I still can not tell anything they are going to have 

00:02:45.680 --> 00:02:49.430
 wait until August and soon there is not 

00:02:47.569 --> 00:02:51.170
 despair there we will have the 

00:02:49.430 --> 00:02:52.760
 news but there are many other good 

00:02:51.170 --> 00:02:54.890
 things other than that as in mode 

00:02:52.760 --> 00:02:56.450
 race also what we are doing 

00:02:54.890 --> 00:02:58.730
 is to change the user interface to 

00:02:56.450 --> 00:03:01.819
 make it much more convenient much more 

00:02:58.730 --> 00:03:03.709
 easy and apart from that there is adding that 

00:03:01.819 --> 00:03:05.900
 we call the global transfer network 

00:03:03.709 --> 00:03:08.030
 because when one plays change mobile the 

00:03:05.900 --> 00:03:10.130
 career mode what happened was that outside 

00:03:08.030 --> 00:03:12.230
 of the gameplay was fun just in 

00:03:10.130 --> 00:03:14.870
 the transfer window but now 

00:03:12.230 --> 00:03:17.180
 what one can do is to contract like this 

00:03:14.870 --> 00:03:18.950
 the scouts and go giving them instructions 

00:03:17.180 --> 00:03:20.420
 to discover new players 

00:03:18.950 --> 00:03:21.739
 that when one reaches the window of 

00:03:20.420 --> 00:03:24.170
 transfer you can hire them 

00:03:21.739 --> 00:03:26.180
 then those new game mechanics 

00:03:24.170 --> 00:03:27.739
 out of what is the gameplay for 

00:03:26.180 --> 00:03:29.900
 make everything much more interesting and much 

00:03:27.739 --> 00:03:32.720
 more fun well and apart from this 

00:03:29.900 --> 00:03:34.610
 meat party career mode there is a 

00:03:32.720 --> 00:03:36.590
 is that at least has many acts 

00:03:34.610 --> 00:03:38.780
 what is the ultimate team is there any 

00:03:36.590 --> 00:03:40.400
 Novelty related to this mode will 

00:03:38.780 --> 00:03:42.860

00:03:40.400 --> 00:03:44.390

00:03:47.390 --> 00:03:52.250
