that Matt Hughes of today might not

00:04:53.600 --> 00:04:55.270 
that Matt Hughes of today might not
because<00:04:54.139> the<00:04:54.259> takedown<00:04:54.620> defense<00:04:54.710> is<00:04:55.009> so<00:04:55.130> good

00:04:55.270 --> 00:04:55.280 
because the takedown defense is so good

00:04:55.280 --> 00:04:57.159

understood<00:04:59.419> but<00:04:59.810> what<00:05:00.020> I<00:05:00.050> think<00:05:00.349> cejudo<00:05:00.800> has

00:05:01.150 --> 00:05:01.160 
understood but what I think cejudo has

00:05:01.160 --> 00:05:03.670 
understood but what I think cejudo has
that<00:05:01.849> comes<00:05:02.300> from<00:05:02.479> wrestling<00:05:02.900> is<00:05:03.050> the<00:05:03.440> grind

00:05:03.670 --> 00:05:03.680 
that comes from wrestling is the grind

00:05:03.680 --> 00:05:06.879 
that comes from wrestling is the grind
that<00:05:04.160> wrestling<00:05:04.430> grind<00:05:05.090> at<00:05:05.389> and<00:05:05.660> at<00:05:05.960> 125

00:05:06.879 --> 00:05:06.889 
that wrestling grind at and at 125

00:05:06.889 --> 00:05:09.670 
that wrestling grind at and at 125
pounds<00:05:07.370> 15<00:05:08.000> minutes<00:05:08.360> 15<00:05:09.110> minutes<00:05:09.139> ago<00:05:09.530> in

pounds 15 minutes 15 minutes ago in
ninety-seven<00:05:10.370> percent<00:05:10.400> I<00:05:10.880> don't<00:05:11.030> think<00:05:11.090> is<00:05:11.330> a

00:05:11.350 --> 00:05:11.360 
ninety-seven percent I don't think is a

00:05:11.360 --> 00:05:13.719 
ninety-seven percent I don't think is a
problem<00:05:11.449> for<00:05:11.990> this<00:05:12.110> guy<00:05:12.259> Kerry<00:05:12.800> osco<00:05:13.190> as<00:05:13.430> well

00:05:13.719 --> 00:05:13.729 
problem for this guy Kerry osco as well

00:05:13.729 --> 00:05:16.450 
problem for this guy Kerry osco as well
but<00:05:14.360> I<00:05:14.509> think<00:05:14.570> this<00:05:15.169> guy<00:05:15.289> if<00:05:15.710> he<00:05:16.130> can<00:05:16.310> go<00:05:16.430> in

00:06:22.250 --> 00:06:24.159 
what the question marks surrounding him
are<00:06:22.490> the<00:06:22.820> guys<00:06:22.970> that<00:06:23.000> Tristar<00:06:23.570> Jim<00:06:23.840> believe

00:06:24.159 --> 00:06:24.169 
are the guys that Tristar Jim believe

00:06:24.169 --> 00:06:26.080 
are the guys that Tristar Jim believe
Roy<00:06:24.650> Nelson's<00:06:25.039> gonna<00:06:25.159> take<00:06:25.430> this<00:06:25.550> guy<00:06:25.729> out<00:06:25.759> I

00:06:26.080 --> 00:06:26.090 
Roy Nelson's gonna take this guy out I

00:06:26.090 --> 00:06:28.870 
Roy Nelson's gonna take this guy out I
think<00:06:26.539> the<00:06:26.870> issue<00:06:27.110> for<00:06:27.560> me<00:06:27.740> on<00:06:28.009> that<00:06:28.490> one<00:06:28.639> is

00:06:28.870 --> 00:06:28.880 
think the issue for me on that one is

00:06:28.880 --> 00:06:31.629 
think the issue for me on that one is
probably<00:06:29.479> so<00:06:30.080> I<00:06:30.320> mean<00:06:30.830> if<00:06:31.039> you<00:06:31.130> just<00:06:31.370> look<00:06:31.610> that

00:06:31.629 --> 00:06:31.639 
probably so I mean if you just look that

00:06:31.639 --> 00:06:33.640 
probably so I mean if you just look that
since<00:06:32.330> he's<00:06:32.449> been<00:06:32.539> in<00:06:32.599> the<00:06:32.750> UFC<00:06:33.020> other<00:06:33.409> than

00:06:33.640 --> 00:06:33.650 
since he's been in the UFC other than

00:06:33.650 --> 00:06:35.830 
since he's been in the UFC other than
kicking<00:06:34.550> Brock<00:06:35.030> Lesnar<00:06:35.419> right<00:06:35.599> in<00:06:35.750> the

00:06:35.830 --> 00:06:35.840

00:06:38.500 --> 00:06:38.510 
diverticulitis or globus or whatever it

00:06:38.510 --> 00:06:39.660 
diverticulitis or globus or whatever it
was<00:06:38.539> kicking<00:06:39.020> a<00:06:39.080> little

00:06:39.660 --> 00:06:39.670

00:06:41.910 --> 00:06:41.920 
Lee in it other than that moment he

00:06:41.920 --> 00:06:43.710 
Lee in it other than that moment he
really<00:06:42.130> doesn't<00:06:42.400> look<00:06:42.490> that<00:06:42.520> good<00:06:42.820> but<00:06:43.180> Nelson

00:06:43.710 --> 00:06:43.720 
really doesn't look that good but Nelson

00:06:43.720 --> 00:06:46.140
