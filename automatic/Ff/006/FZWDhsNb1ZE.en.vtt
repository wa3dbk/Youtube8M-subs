00:00:10.370 --> 00:00:15.930
 hello, dota channel with you all day 

00:00:13.170 --> 00:00:17.910
 and this is a guide for the rank so what can 

00:00:15.930 --> 00:00:20.580
 perform such roles in a team as 

00:00:17.910 --> 00:00:22.320
 support jungler and pusher and now 

00:00:20.580 --> 00:00:24.689
 let's move on to build for 

00:00:22.320 --> 00:00:25.849
 member and now you see the first ones 

00:00:24.689 --> 00:00:28.830
 on their screens 

00:00:25.849 --> 00:00:29.490
 as in any other skill build 1 we 

00:00:28.830 --> 00:00:31.740
 we will max 

00:00:29.490 --> 00:00:34.019
 perrier teaching to farm easily 

00:00:31.740 --> 00:00:36.449
 the forest and do unexpected ganks together 

00:00:34.019 --> 00:00:38.489
 with your zoo second we will 

00:00:36.449 --> 00:00:40.650
 max tests for our 

00:00:38.489 --> 00:00:42.870
 races were more effective for the body 

00:00:40.650 --> 00:00:43.519
 porting allies home into dangerous 

00:00:42.870 --> 00:00:45.900
 situations 

00:00:43.519 --> 00:00:48.330
 maybe some of you will ask why 

00:00:45.900 --> 00:00:51.330
 I did not pump the first skill at least 

00:00:48.330 --> 00:00:52.680
 one started because it gives slowing but 

00:00:51.330 --> 00:00:54.989
 the fact is that the slowdown and 

00:00:52.680 --> 00:00:56.699
 additional damage to the target on the first 

00:00:54.989 --> 00:00:59.010
 level just eight percent 

00:00:56.699 --> 00:01:02.159
 that's pretty scanty even in the initial 

00:00:59.010 --> 00:01:04.019
 stage of the game now move on to the second 

00:01:02.159 --> 00:01:06.840
 Maskel bildu which is great 

00:01:04.019 --> 00:01:09.090
 for those cases when an ally to 

00:01:06.840 --> 00:01:11.820
 you will go on line to help 

00:01:09.090 --> 00:01:13.920
 pinganut has great damage with hands or 

00:01:11.820 --> 00:01:16.770
 strong prank but does not have good 

00:01:13.920 --> 00:01:18.990
 design so we will be the second max 1 

00:01:16.770 --> 00:01:21.929
 skill that will increase the damage on the target and 

00:01:18.990 --> 00:01:23.969
 slow it down then huge damage 

00:01:21.929 --> 00:01:26.429
 ally and bonus to this damage from 

00:01:23.969 --> 00:01:29.219
 first skill is one hundred percent kill 

00:01:26.429 --> 00:01:32.640
 but we still bleed the tests on Face 

00:01:29.219 --> 00:01:34.619
 fourth level due to teleportation well 

00:01:32.640 --> 00:01:37.259
 here about the skill builds all and let's 

00:01:34.619 --> 00:01:39.229
 Let's move Kaido honey for a member and now 

00:01:37.259 --> 00:01:42.090
 you see the first ones on your screens 

00:01:39.229 --> 00:01:44.249
 our starting purchase will be tango 2 

00:01:42.090 --> 00:01:46.380
 smoke courier and wards and two sprigs 

00:01:44.249 --> 00:01:49.350
 which will later turn into a mecca 

00:01:46.380 --> 00:01:51.780
 Then we buy basil which will give our 

00:01:49.350 --> 00:01:52.289
 Zoo 2 to armor and no girlfriend us 

00:01:51.780 --> 00:01:54.899
 manna 

00:01:52.289 --> 00:01:57.179
 shoes and as soon as possible collect 

00:01:54.899 --> 00:01:59.520
 mecca then from shoes do 

00:01:57.179 --> 00:02:01.880
 orokans and collect aganim to kd 

00:01:59.520 --> 00:02:04.950
 our Ultimate was just 30 seconds 

00:02:01.880 --> 00:02:06.689
 since it does not depend on artifacts 

00:02:04.950 --> 00:02:09.330
 all other items are collected by 

00:02:06.689 --> 00:02:12.330
 situations if a team needs protection 

00:02:09.330 --> 00:02:14.520
 from pranks cake can collect pipe if 

00:02:12.330 --> 00:02:17.610
 Pusta need not be collected because the crane and 

00:02:14.520 --> 00:02:19.770
 further 2 site build is suitable for 

00:02:17.610 --> 00:02:21.750
 aggressive game on chen and our 

00:02:19.770 --> 00:02:23.030
 Starting purchase will be a fuska person 

00:02:21.750 --> 00:02:25.340
 mask and courier 

00:02:23.030 --> 00:02:27.319
 after which we take the boots and collect 

00:02:25.340 --> 00:02:28.190
 medal with which our race will be 

00:02:27.319 --> 00:02:31.250
 more efficient 

00:02:28.190 --> 00:02:33.800
 it is also easy to take roshana with her now 

00:02:31.250 --> 00:02:34.310
 collect mecca and buy organs and force 

00:02:33.800 --> 00:02:37.130
 staff 

00:02:34.310 --> 00:02:40.220
 but aganim all other artifacts 

00:02:37.130 --> 00:02:42.110
 collect on the situation but about skill 

00:02:40.220 --> 00:02:44.090
 build hee and site build all 

00:02:42.110 --> 00:02:46.850
 and let's move the gameplay and useful 

00:02:44.090 --> 00:02:48.590
 tips for hours on the Gameboy for a member 

00:02:46.850 --> 00:02:50.330
 this is calm farming in the forest with 

00:02:48.590 --> 00:02:52.819
 aggressive lines exits 

00:02:50.330 --> 00:02:54.890
 intent to kill before buying mickey 

00:02:52.819 --> 00:02:56.720
 after which you run with the team and 

00:02:54.890 --> 00:02:58.850
 help allies live longer 

00:02:56.720 --> 00:03:01.880
 batches and now let's go to 

00:02:58.850 --> 00:03:03.830
 useful tips for a member about first 

00:03:01.880 --> 00:03:06.709
 I want to say only what is outside 

00:03:03.830 --> 00:03:08.120
 depending on the source of damage whether with 

00:03:06.709 --> 00:03:10.760
 Kiev or blow from the hand 

00:03:08.120 --> 00:03:12.980
 additional damage comes separately 

00:03:10.760 --> 00:03:16.610
 physical damage meaning he will 

00:03:12.980 --> 00:03:18.739
 decline armor about tests from wanna 

00:03:16.610 --> 00:03:21.530
 say only what tests faces 

00:03:18.739 --> 00:03:24.380
 tests from teleport have different caldauns 

00:03:21.530 --> 00:03:26.540
 independent of each other but here from 

00:03:24.380 --> 00:03:29.150
 tests with teleport would like to talk 

00:03:26.540 --> 00:03:30.650
 more detail because with this scion you can 

00:03:29.150 --> 00:03:33.829
 use multiple bundles 

00:03:30.650 --> 00:03:35.810
 one of them is a pooj plus teleport cannon 

00:03:33.829 --> 00:03:37.250
 give a hook during how it ends 

00:03:35.810 --> 00:03:40.010
 teleport preparation 

00:03:37.250 --> 00:03:42.829
 and attracts the enemy behind a fountain 

00:03:40.010 --> 00:03:45.500
 also an interesting bunch is the cross watch 

00:03:42.829 --> 00:03:49.180
 and teleport to the hall throw a cross on 

00:03:45.500 --> 00:03:51.950
 ally and we teleport him home a 

00:03:49.180 --> 00:03:54.200
 with value, I can only say that 

00:03:51.950 --> 00:03:56.630
 at the beginning of the most current clips 

00:03:54.200 --> 00:03:59.630
 are the gargoyles with their lightning troll 

00:03:56.630 --> 00:04:02.660
 mesh and skeletons for pushing a centaur with 

00:03:59.630 --> 00:04:05.600
 Orson's camp creak and keep you ire 

00:04:02.660 --> 00:04:08.930
 genka in mid-game remain useful 

00:04:05.600 --> 00:04:11.239
 troll netting and centaur with the camp log 

00:04:08.930 --> 00:04:14.000
 the best creeps is a centaur with his aura 

00:04:11.239 --> 00:04:16.940
 increase attack speed and vox of his aura 

00:04:14.000 --> 00:04:19.549
 increased damage with gargoyles at the beginning 

00:04:16.940 --> 00:04:22.340
 games can be very spoiled nerves 

00:04:19.549 --> 00:04:25.070
 other foresters such as enigma or 

00:04:22.340 --> 00:04:27.470
 furion because the gargoyles cause chain damage 

00:04:25.070 --> 00:04:32.539
 and will quickly demolish and Dogon Rene km and or 

00:04:27.470 --> 00:04:34.490
 furion hemp in ultimayte me talk 

00:04:32.539 --> 00:04:36.680
 nothing hill is hill 

00:04:34.490 --> 00:04:40.009
 except that only our ultimate 

00:04:36.680 --> 00:04:42.050
 heals spell immune units well 

00:04:40.009 --> 00:04:43.970
 here is my guide and I want to end 

00:04:42.050 --> 00:04:46.280
