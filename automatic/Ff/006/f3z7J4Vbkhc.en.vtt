answered it correctly it's because of

00:02:00.750 --> 00:02:04.039 
answered it correctly it's because of
the<00:02:00.869> calcium<00:02:01.520> what<00:02:02.520> I<00:02:02.549> have<00:02:02.729> found<00:02:02.939> is<00:02:03.299> it<00:02:03.780> over

00:02:04.039 --> 00:02:04.049 
the calcium what I have found is it over

00:02:04.049 --> 00:02:09.380 
the calcium what I have found is it over
time<00:02:04.729> that<00:02:05.729> dairy<00:02:06.600> can<00:02:07.469> compromise<00:02:08.390> pancreas

00:02:09.380 --> 00:02:09.390 
time that dairy can compromise pancreas

00:02:09.390 --> 00:02:11.630 
time that dairy can compromise pancreas
function<00:02:09.929> see<00:02:10.050> the<00:02:10.170> pancreas<00:02:10.590> does<00:02:11.099> more<00:02:11.610> than

00:02:11.630 --> 00:02:11.640 
function see the pancreas does more than

00:02:11.640 --> 00:02:13.280 
function see the pancreas does more than
just<00:02:11.819> secrete<00:02:12.330> insulin

00:02:13.280 --> 00:02:13.290 
just secrete insulin

00:02:13.290 --> 00:02:16.309 
just secrete insulin
it<00:02:13.349> secretes<00:02:14.010> enzymes<00:02:14.219> and<00:02:15.180> if<00:02:15.719> you<00:02:15.930> overwork

00:02:16.309 --> 00:02:16.319 
it secretes enzymes and if you overwork

00:02:16.319 --> 00:02:19.759 
it secretes enzymes and if you overwork
your<00:02:16.799> fat<00:02:17.219> enzyme<00:02:17.790> called<00:02:18.150> lipase<00:02:18.840> you<00:02:19.620> could

00:02:19.759 --> 00:02:19.769 
your fat enzyme called lipase you could

00:02:19.769 --> 00:02:22.520 
your fat enzyme called lipase you could
