there's an aquaponics of dish from the

moment because the waters to very cool
the<00:01:06.450> system<00:01:06.750> is<00:01:06.869> cycling<00:01:07.200> at<00:01:07.290> the<00:01:07.380> moment<00:01:07.650> you

00:01:07.700 --> 00:01:07.710 
the system is cycling at the moment you

00:01:07.710 --> 00:01:09.080 
the system is cycling at the moment you
can<00:01:07.830> see<00:01:07.860> the<00:01:08.040> water<00:01:08.220> rising<00:01:08.670> I'll<00:01:08.790> take<00:01:08.970> you

00:01:09.080 --> 00:01:09.090 
can see the water rising I'll take you

00:01:09.090 --> 00:01:15.910 
can see the water rising I'll take you
through<00:01:09.119> how<00:01:09.659> the<00:01:09.720> system<00:01:10.229> cycles<00:01:11.720> first<00:01:13.130> -

00:01:15.910 --> 00:01:15.920 
through how the system cycles first -

00:01:15.920 --> 00:01:19.120 
through how the system cycles first -
which<00:01:16.920> is<00:01:17.040> very<00:01:17.250> simple<00:01:17.549> easy<00:01:17.640> to<00:01:17.820> make

00:01:19.120 --> 00:01:19.130 
which is very simple easy to make

00:01:19.130 --> 00:01:21.260 
which is very simple easy to make
basically<00:01:20.130> it<00:01:20.220> circles<00:01:20.670> our<00:01:20.759> own<00:01:20.850> like<00:01:21.030> water

00:01:21.260 --> 00:01:21.270 
basically it circles our own like water

00:01:21.270 --> 00:01:31.429 
basically it circles our own like water
and<00:01:21.509> tails

00:03:24.769 --> 00:03:26.500 
just to clear up the water as you can

see the water is created Murphy that's

00:03:26.510 --> 00:03:31.780 
see the water is created Murphy that's
algae<00:03:27.549> so<00:03:28.690> to<00:03:29.690> try<00:03:29.900> and<00:03:30.019> clear<00:03:30.230> that<00:03:30.379> up<00:03:30.790> we're

00:03:31.780 --> 00:03:31.790 
algae so to try and clear that up we're

00:03:52.710 --> 00:03:52.720 

00:03:52.720 --> 00:04:08.640 

pretty<00:03:53.720> regular<00:03:54.680> small<00:04:00.519> just<00:04:01.519> bare<00:04:01.790> the<00:04:01.970> worms

about<00:04:10.449> 15<00:04:11.449> 20<00:04:11.900> trials<00:04:12.199> is<00:04:12.739> 7<00:04:13.519> -<00:04:13.579> go<00:04:13.609> fish

00:04:14.259 --> 00:04:14.269 
about 15 20 trials is 7 - go fish

00:04:14.269 --> 00:04:15.759 
about 15 20 trials is 7 - go fish
and<00:04:14.419> there's<00:04:14.660> two<00:04:14.810> really<00:04:15.019> small<00:04:15.379> fish<00:04:15.620> in

00:04:15.759 --> 00:04:15.769 
and there's two really small fish in

00:04:15.769 --> 00:04:19.280 
and there's two really small fish in
there<00:04:15.980> I<00:04:16.180> think<00:04:17.180> the<00:04:17.269> deeper<00:04:17.539> part

00:04:19.280 --> 00:04:19.290 
there I think the deeper part

00:04:19.290 --> 00:04:23.360 
there I think the deeper part
over<00:04:20.280> there<00:04:20.520> they<00:04:20.790> all<00:04:21.800> seem<00:04:22.800> to<00:04:22.830> get<00:04:23.130> along

over there they all seem to get along

00:04:23.370 --> 00:04:27.890 
over there they all seem to get along
really<00:04:23.580> well

00:04:27.890 --> 00:04:27.900

00:04:31.320 --> 00:04:41.050 
system is in you
we<00:04:32.160> do<00:04:32.310> regular<00:04:32.700> water<00:04:32.910> changes<00:04:37.370> and

00:04:41.050 --> 00:04:41.060 

00:04:41.060 --> 00:04:46.430 

everybody<00:04:42.060> seems<00:04:42.330> to<00:04:42.480> be<00:04:42.600> pretty<00:04:42.810> happy<00:04:45.440> we're

00:04:46.430 --> 00:04:46.440 
everybody seems to be pretty happy we're

00:04:46.440 --> 00:04:47.600 
everybody seems to be pretty happy we're
waiting<00:04:46.680> for<00:04:46.710> the<00:04:46.920> temperature<00:04:47.310> to<00:04:47.430> rise

00:04:47.600 --> 00:04:47.610 
waiting for the temperature to rise

00:04:47.610 --> 00:04:58.420 
waiting for the temperature to rise
really<00:04:48.120> for<00:04:48.300> the<00:04:48.360> system<00:04:48.810> to<00:04:48.900> psyche<00:04:49.850> properly

00:04:58.420 --> 00:04:58.430 

00:04:58.430 --> 00:05:02.660 

as<00:04:59.430> you<00:04:59.640> can<00:04:59.760> see<00:04:59.880> the<00:05:00.000> water<00:05:00.210> here<00:05:01.550> so<00:05:02.550> this

00:05:02.660 --> 00:05:02.670 
as you can see the water here so this

00:05:02.670 --> 00:05:04.610 
as you can see the water here so this
water<00:05:03.210> had<00:05:03.540> gone<00:05:03.720> through<00:05:03.900> the<00:05:04.050> whole<00:05:04.080> process

00:05:04.610 --> 00:05:04.620 
water had gone through the whole process

00:05:04.620 --> 00:05:05.990 
water had gone through the whole process
will<00:05:04.740> go<00:05:04.860> through<00:05:05.070> the<00:05:05.190> vortex<00:05:05.370> filter<00:05:05.850> to

00:05:05.990 --> 00:05:06.000 
will go through the vortex filter to

00:05:06.000 --> 00:05:08.360 
will go through the vortex filter to
take<00:05:06.150> the<00:05:06.240> biggest<00:05:06.420> parts<00:05:07.380> without<00:05:07.500> has<00:05:08.160> gone

00:05:08.360 --> 00:05:08.370 
take the biggest parts without has gone

00:05:08.370 --> 00:05:10.760 
take the biggest parts without has gone
through<00:05:08.580> the<00:05:08.880> sponge<00:05:09.390> media<00:05:09.870> in<00:05:10.320> the<00:05:10.560> white

00:05:10.760 --> 00:05:10.770 
through the sponge media in the white

00:05:10.770 --> 00:05:13.010 
through the sponge media in the white
tote<00:05:11.010> behind<00:05:11.340> us<00:05:11.490> and<00:05:12.000> it's<00:05:12.450> gone<00:05:12.600> through<00:05:12.840> the

00:05:13.010 --> 00:05:13.020 
tote behind us and it's gone through the

00:05:13.020 --> 00:05:20.300 
tote behind us and it's gone through the
NFT<00:05:13.380> channel<00:05:13.830> and<00:05:14.070> this<00:05:14.220> vertical<00:05:19.160> it<00:05:20.160> will

00:05:20.300 --> 00:05:20.310 
NFT channel and this vertical it will

00:05:20.310 --> 00:05:21.560 
NFT channel and this vertical it will
float<00:05:20.640> straight<00:05:20.910> down<00:05:21.090> into<00:05:21.270> the<00:05:21.360> fish<00:05:21.540> tank

00:05:21.560 --> 00:05:21.570 
float straight down into the fish tank

00:05:21.570 --> 00:05:23.660 
float straight down into the fish tank
