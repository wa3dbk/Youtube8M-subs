00:01:43.310 --> 00:01:43.320 
was quite a gamble because we've been

00:01:43.320 --> 00:01:44.840 
was quite a gamble because we've been
having<00:01:43.470> problems<00:01:43.740> earlier<00:01:44.280> in<00:01:44.369> the<00:01:44.429> round<00:01:44.580> and

00:01:44.840 --> 00:01:44.850 
having problems earlier in the round and

00:01:46.340 --> 00:01:46.350 
we just didn't know and we figured we

00:01:46.350 --> 00:01:47.870 
we just didn't know and we figured we
need<00:01:46.710> some<00:01:46.860> more<00:01:46.950> performance<00:01:47.429> for<00:01:47.520> the<00:01:47.580> final
