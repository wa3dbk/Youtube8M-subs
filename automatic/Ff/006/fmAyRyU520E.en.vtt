00:00:00.030 --> 00:00:02.149 

I<00:00:00.060> think<00:00:00.420> two<00:00:00.570> to<00:00:00.750> seven<00:00:01.170> game<00:00:01.350> losses<00:00:01.920> to<00:00:02.040> the

00:00:02.149 --> 00:00:02.159 
I think two to seven game losses to the

00:00:02.159 --> 00:00:05.599 
I think two to seven game losses to the
Rockets<00:00:03.500> probably<00:00:04.500> want<00:00:04.859> to<00:00:04.890> stick<00:00:05.190> with<00:00:05.250> me

00:00:05.599 --> 00:00:05.609 
Rockets probably want to stick with me

00:00:05.609 --> 00:00:07.220 
Rockets probably want to stick with me
the<00:00:05.730> most<00:00:05.940> I<00:00:06.150> mean<00:00:06.270> the<00:00:06.390> Bulls<00:00:06.600> I<00:00:06.870> mean<00:00:07.109> they

00:00:07.220 --> 00:00:07.230 
the most I mean the Bulls I mean they

00:00:07.230 --> 00:00:13.970 
the most I mean the Bulls I mean they
won<00:00:07.410> six<00:00:07.710> champion<00:00:12.080> to<00:00:13.080> the<00:00:13.200> Rockets<00:00:13.559> twice<00:00:13.799> to

00:00:13.970 --> 00:00:13.980 
won six champion to the Rockets twice to

00:00:13.980 --> 00:00:16.250 
won six champion to the Rockets twice to
two<00:00:14.130> years<00:00:14.370> they<00:00:14.580> won<00:00:14.849> in<00:00:15.599> the<00:00:15.900> conference

00:00:16.250 --> 00:00:16.260 
two years they won in the conference

00:00:16.260 --> 00:00:18.290 
two years they won in the conference
fine<00:00:16.440> so<00:00:16.650> those<00:00:16.800> two<00:00:17.130> tough<00:00:17.400> game<00:00:17.609> sevens<00:00:18.090> I

00:00:18.290 --> 00:00:18.300 
fine so those two tough game sevens I

00:00:18.300 --> 00:00:21.200 
fine so those two tough game sevens I
probably<00:00:19.260> those<00:00:19.680> were<00:00:19.890> very<00:00:20.369> difficult<00:00:21.000> to

00:00:21.200 --> 00:00:21.210 
probably those were very difficult to

00:00:21.210 --> 00:00:22.939 
probably those were very difficult to
get<00:00:21.359> over<00:00:21.390> to<00:00:21.630> be<00:00:21.779> honest<00:00:22.020> with<00:00:22.170> you<00:00:22.320> but<00:00:22.859> you

00:00:22.939 --> 00:00:22.949 
get over to be honest with you but you

00:00:22.949 --> 00:00:26.269 
get over to be honest with you but you
know<00:00:23.010> you<00:00:23.130> talk<00:00:23.369> about<00:00:23.519> the<00:00:23.730> playoffs<00:00:25.279> when

00:00:26.269 --> 00:00:26.279 
know you talk about the playoffs when

00:00:26.279 --> 00:00:28.640 
know you talk about the playoffs when
the<00:00:26.400> playoffs<00:00:26.939> start<00:00:27.330> there's<00:00:28.140> so<00:00:28.439> much

00:00:28.640 --> 00:00:28.650 
the playoffs start there's so much

00:00:28.650 --> 00:00:31.009 
the playoffs start there's so much
energy<00:00:28.920> and<00:00:29.369> intensity<00:00:29.789> going<00:00:30.090> on<00:00:30.269> but<00:00:30.929> it

00:00:31.009 --> 00:00:31.019 
energy and intensity going on but it

00:00:31.019 --> 00:00:33.770 
energy and intensity going on but it
just<00:00:31.050> ramps<00:00:31.560> up<00:00:31.740> every<00:00:32.099> round<00:00:32.340> you<00:00:32.489> go<00:00:32.759> but<00:00:33.690> the

00:00:33.770 --> 00:00:33.780 
just ramps up every round you go but the

00:00:33.780 --> 00:00:36.110 
just ramps up every round you go but the
thing<00:00:34.020> that<00:00:34.050> makes<00:00:34.590> that<00:00:34.829> that<00:00:35.160> energy<00:00:35.579> so

00:00:36.110 --> 00:00:36.120 
thing that makes that that energy so

00:00:36.120 --> 00:00:39.190 
thing that makes that that energy so
high<00:00:36.300> and<00:00:36.660> your<00:00:36.840> adrenaline<00:00:37.370> when<00:00:38.370> you<00:00:38.520> lose

00:00:39.190 --> 00:00:39.200 
high and your adrenaline when you lose

00:00:39.200 --> 00:00:42.020 
high and your adrenaline when you lose
it's<00:00:40.200> like<00:00:40.469> a<00:00:40.500> death<00:00:40.800> in<00:00:41.010> the<00:00:41.040> family<00:00:41.129> now<00:00:41.910> that

00:00:42.020 --> 00:00:42.030 
it's like a death in the family now that

00:00:42.030 --> 00:00:43.040 
it's like a death in the family now that
sounds<00:00:42.270> a<00:00:42.329> whole<00:00:42.480> different<00:00:42.780> element<00:00:42.840> you

00:00:43.040 --> 00:00:43.050 
sounds a whole different element you

00:00:43.050 --> 00:00:44.479 
sounds a whole different element you
never<00:00:43.290> get<00:00:43.440> over<00:00:43.559> losing<00:00:43.649> the<00:00:43.950> finals<00:00:44.340> you

00:00:44.479 --> 00:00:44.489 
never get over losing the finals you

00:00:47.090 --> 00:00:47.100 
never get over that but when you like

just saying there's just never a
nervousness<00:01:10.290> about<00:01:10.979> it<00:01:11.159> because<00:01:11.700> he<00:01:11.820> has<00:01:12.000> an

00:01:12.200 --> 00:01:12.210 
nervousness about it because he has an

00:01:12.210 --> 00:01:14.960 
nervousness about it because he has an
understanding<00:01:12.810> of<00:01:13.020> what<00:01:13.740> makes<00:01:13.950> everybody<00:01:14.280> go

00:01:14.960 --> 00:01:14.970 
understanding of what makes everybody go

00:01:14.970 --> 00:01:19.070 
understanding of what makes everybody go
and<00:01:15.530> when<00:01:16.530> we're<00:01:16.680> not<00:01:16.710> on<00:01:17.159> the<00:01:17.610> same<00:01:17.939> page<00:01:18.420> he

00:01:19.070 --> 00:01:19.080 
and when we're not on the same page he

00:01:19.080 --> 00:01:21.350 
and when we're not on the same page he
knows<00:01:19.290> exactly<00:01:19.799> kind<00:01:20.400> of<00:01:20.520> what<00:01:20.580> paragraph<00:01:21.000> to

00:01:21.350 --> 00:01:21.360 
knows exactly kind of what paragraph to

00:01:21.360 --> 00:01:24.050 
knows exactly kind of what paragraph to
pick<00:01:21.540> out<00:01:21.750> so<00:01:22.470> that<00:01:22.710> we're<00:01:23.460> back<00:01:23.670> there<00:01:23.850> pretty

00:01:24.050 --> 00:01:24.060 
pick out so that we're back there pretty

00:01:24.060 --> 00:01:26.390 
pick out so that we're back there pretty
quick<00:01:24.420> and<00:01:24.659> he<00:01:25.470> does<00:01:25.890> play<00:01:26.130> the<00:01:26.250> same

00:01:26.390 --> 00:01:26.400 
quick and he does play the same

00:01:26.400 --> 00:01:28.370 
quick and he does play the same
psychological<00:01:27.299> games<00:01:27.479> I<00:01:27.659> think<00:01:27.869> that<00:01:28.020> the

00:01:28.370 --> 00:01:28.380 
psychological games I think that the

00:01:28.380 --> 00:01:30.350 
psychological games I think that the
fill<00:01:28.619> would<00:01:28.799> play<00:01:28.979> like<00:01:29.579> Shaq<00:01:29.790> was<00:01:29.939> mentioning

00:01:30.350 --> 00:01:30.360 
fill would play like Shaq was mentioning

00:01:30.360 --> 00:01:32.210 
fill would play like Shaq was mentioning
in<00:01:30.750> order<00:01:30.990> for<00:01:31.110> you<00:01:31.200> guys<00:01:31.350> to<00:01:31.590> find<00:01:31.860> really

in order for you guys to find really

00:01:32.220 --> 00:01:34.069 
in order for you guys to find really
what<00:01:32.430> your<00:01:32.549> center<00:01:32.909> is<00:01:33.090> and<00:01:33.600> that's<00:01:33.810> about

00:01:34.069 --> 00:01:34.079 
what your center is and that's about

00:01:34.079 --> 00:01:35.240 
what your center is and that's about

00:01:37.490 --> 00:01:37.500 
accountability and that starts from day

00:01:37.500 --> 00:01:39.140 
accountability and that starts from day
one<00:01:37.710> to<00:01:37.829> training<00:01:38.159> camp<00:01:38.340> the<00:01:38.520> message<00:01:39.000> just

00:01:39.140 --> 00:01:39.150 
one to training camp the message just

00:01:39.150 --> 00:01:41.120 
one to training camp the message just
doesn't<00:01:39.540> change<00:01:39.750> all<00:01:40.020> year<00:01:40.290> long<00:01:40.470> it's<00:01:41.009> a

00:01:41.120 --> 00:01:41.130 
doesn't change all year long it's a

00:01:41.130 --> 00:01:42.889 
doesn't change all year long it's a
process<00:01:41.430> until<00:01:42.090> it's<00:01:42.299> the<00:01:42.360> end<00:01:42.630> of<00:01:42.750> the

00:01:42.889 --> 00:01:42.899 
process until it's the end of the

00:01:42.899 --> 00:01:44.719 
process until it's the end of the
process<00:01:43.350> and<00:01:43.530> then<00:01:43.619> when<00:01:44.130> that<00:01:44.280> one's<00:01:44.520> done

00:01:44.719 --> 00:01:44.729 
process and then when that one's done

00:01:44.729 --> 00:01:46.969 
process and then when that one's done
we'll<00:01:45.030> worry<00:01:45.210> about<00:01:45.299> the<00:01:45.689> next<00:01:45.930> one<00:01:46.229> but<00:01:46.860> it's

00:01:46.969 --> 00:01:46.979 
we'll worry about the next one but it's
