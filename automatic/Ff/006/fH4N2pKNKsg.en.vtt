00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.360 

okay<00:00:00.900> so<00:00:00.960> the<00:00:01.079> reason<00:00:01.230> why<00:00:01.439> we<00:00:01.560> use<00:00:01.800> YouTube

00:00:02.360 --> 00:00:02.370 
okay so the reason why we use YouTube

00:00:02.370 --> 00:00:04.640 
okay so the reason why we use YouTube
pre-roll<00:00:02.790> ads<00:00:02.909> so<00:00:03.090> extensively<00:00:03.659> is<00:00:04.259> because

00:00:04.640 --> 00:00:04.650 
pre-roll ads so extensively is because

00:00:04.650 --> 00:00:07.160 
pre-roll ads so extensively is because
they<00:00:05.190> bring<00:00:05.430> in<00:00:05.549> leeds<00:00:05.790> very<00:00:06.299> quickly<00:00:06.629> but

00:00:07.160 --> 00:00:07.170 
they bring in leeds very quickly but

00:00:07.170 --> 00:00:09.049 
they bring in leeds very quickly but
also<00:00:07.319> they<00:00:07.770> are<00:00:07.919> very<00:00:08.189> cost<00:00:08.519> effective

00:00:09.049 --> 00:00:09.059 
also they are very cost effective

00:00:09.059 --> 00:00:11.749 
also they are very cost effective
sometimes<00:00:09.719> by<00:00:10.230> using<00:00:10.469> pre-roll<00:00:10.950> ads<00:00:11.099> we<00:00:11.639> can

00:00:11.749 --> 00:00:11.759 
sometimes by using pre-roll ads we can

00:00:11.759 --> 00:00:13.910 
sometimes by using pre-roll ads we can
get<00:00:11.880> our<00:00:11.969> clients<00:00:12.420> leads<00:00:12.809> for<00:00:13.380> a<00:00:13.440> tenth<00:00:13.710> that

00:00:13.910 --> 00:00:13.920 
get our clients leads for a tenth that

00:00:13.920 --> 00:00:16.490 
get our clients leads for a tenth that
price<00:00:14.130> they<00:00:14.309> might<00:00:14.460> be<00:00:14.580> paying<00:00:14.820> elsewhere<00:00:15.500> so

00:00:16.490 --> 00:00:16.500 
price they might be paying elsewhere so

00:00:16.500 --> 00:00:18.830 
price they might be paying elsewhere so
we<00:00:17.130> do<00:00:17.340> use<00:00:17.580> pre-rolls<00:00:18.029> very<00:00:18.600> very

00:00:18.830 --> 00:00:18.840 
we do use pre-rolls very very

00:00:18.840 --> 00:00:21.439 
we do use pre-rolls very very
effectively<00:00:19.260> the<00:00:20.039> fact<00:00:20.220> is<00:00:20.369> it<00:00:20.640> comes<00:00:20.939> down<00:00:21.119> to

00:00:21.439 --> 00:00:21.449 
effectively the fact is it comes down to

00:00:21.449 --> 00:00:24.380 
effectively the fact is it comes down to
the<00:00:21.869> type<00:00:22.170> of<00:00:22.199> video<00:00:22.680> it<00:00:22.830> is<00:00:22.859> and<00:00:23.279> also<00:00:23.970> the<00:00:24.300> way

00:00:24.380 --> 00:00:24.390 
the type of video it is and also the way

00:00:24.390 --> 00:00:26.179 
the type of video it is and also the way
we<00:00:24.510> structure<00:00:24.960> the<00:00:24.990> video<00:00:25.289> and<00:00:25.560> this<00:00:25.949> is<00:00:26.070> why

00:00:26.179 --> 00:00:26.189 
we structure the video and this is why

00:00:26.189 --> 00:00:28.220 
we structure the video and this is why
it<00:00:26.279> works<00:00:26.519> so<00:00:26.640> effectively<00:00:26.939> and<00:00:27.720> then<00:00:27.900> explain

00:00:28.220 --> 00:00:28.230 
it works so effectively and then explain

00:00:28.230 --> 00:00:30.320 
it works so effectively and then explain
why<00:00:28.260> because<00:00:28.769> with<00:00:29.400> a<00:00:29.429> pre-roll<00:00:29.820> ad<00:00:29.970> obviously

00:00:30.320 --> 00:00:30.330 
why because with a pre-roll ad obviously

00:00:30.330 --> 00:00:32.269 
why because with a pre-roll ad obviously
can<00:00:30.449> be<00:00:30.539> very<00:00:30.779> very<00:00:30.960> targeted<00:00:31.500> at<00:00:31.679> who<00:00:32.070> you

00:00:32.269 --> 00:00:32.279 
can be very very targeted at who you

00:00:32.279 --> 00:00:33.950 
can be very very targeted at who you
want<00:00:32.520> to<00:00:32.700> get<00:00:32.880> in<00:00:32.969> front<00:00:33.149> of<00:00:33.390> and<00:00:33.630> it<00:00:33.719> might<00:00:33.840> be

00:00:33.950 --> 00:00:33.960 
want to get in front of and it might be

00:00:33.960 --> 00:00:36.530 
want to get in front of and it might be
by<00:00:34.079> demographic<00:00:34.829> by<00:00:35.010> location<00:00:35.730> by<00:00:36.510> a

00:00:36.530 --> 00:00:36.540 
by demographic by location by a

00:00:36.540 --> 00:00:38.330 
by demographic by location by a
remarketing<00:00:37.170> list<00:00:37.530> for<00:00:37.739> example<00:00:38.190> or

remarketing list for example or
retargeting<00:00:39.059> list<00:00:39.270> and<00:00:39.559> when<00:00:40.559> you<00:00:40.710> identify

00:00:40.970 --> 00:00:40.980 
retargeting list and when you identify

00:00:40.980 --> 00:00:43.369 
retargeting list and when you identify
exactly<00:00:41.610> who<00:00:41.910> you<00:00:42.030> want<00:00:42.149> to<00:00:42.270> contact<00:00:42.570> using

00:01:11.420 --> 00:01:11.430 
them using some different techniques we

00:01:11.430 --> 00:01:13.820 
them using some different techniques we
are<00:01:11.700> very<00:01:11.970> effective<00:01:12.180> of<00:01:12.450> that<00:01:12.590> but<00:01:13.590> then<00:01:13.710> in

00:01:13.820 --> 00:01:13.830 
are very effective of that but then in

00:01:13.830 --> 00:01:15.050 
are very effective of that but then in
the<00:01:13.890> video<00:01:14.100> itself<00:01:14.430> you<00:01:14.640> want<00:01:14.820> to<00:01:14.909> make<00:01:15.030> sure

00:01:15.050 --> 00:01:15.060 
the video itself you want to make sure

00:01:15.060 --> 00:01:17.539

only<00:01:18.180> if<00:01:18.420> they<00:01:18.930> are<00:01:18.960> very<00:01:19.350> very<00:01:19.860> qualified<00:01:20.490> and

00:01:21.130 --> 00:01:21.140 
only if they are very very qualified and

00:01:21.140 --> 00:01:23.420 
only if they are very very qualified and
targeted<00:01:22.140> lead<00:01:22.290> for<00:01:22.530> who<00:01:22.770> you're<00:01:23.009> marketing

targeted lead for who you're marketing
to<00:01:23.900> now<00:01:24.900> if<00:01:25.080> you<00:01:25.170> can<00:01:25.320> do<00:01:25.409> that<00:01:25.590> effectively

00:01:25.880 --> 00:01:25.890 
to now if you can do that effectively

00:01:25.890 --> 00:01:28.070 
to now if you can do that effectively
what<00:01:26.549> you'll<00:01:26.670> find<00:01:26.880> is<00:01:27.119> that<00:01:27.150> when<00:01:27.810> someone

00:01:28.070 --> 00:01:28.080 
what you'll find is that when someone

00:01:28.080 --> 00:01:29.539 
what you'll find is that when someone
goes<00:01:28.170> back<00:01:28.380> to<00:01:28.500> the<00:01:28.590> website<00:01:28.979> they<00:01:29.189> already

goes back to the website they already

00:01:29.549 --> 00:01:33.319 
goes back to the website they already
know<00:01:29.850> what<00:01:30.479> to<00:01:30.630> expect<00:01:31.020> so<00:01:31.770> for<00:01:31.920> example<00:01:32.329> say

00:01:33.319 --> 00:01:33.329 
know what to expect so for example say

00:01:33.329 --> 00:01:34.969 
know what to expect so for example say
for<00:01:33.450> example<00:01:33.509> you<00:01:33.780> do<00:01:34.110> webinars<00:01:34.470> on<00:01:34.740> a<00:01:34.799> regular
