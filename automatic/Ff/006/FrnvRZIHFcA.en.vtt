00:01:38.500 --> 00:01:41.069 
and
it's<00:01:39.340> supposed<00:01:39.610> to<00:01:39.700> be<00:01:39.850> line<00:01:40.180> smoothing<00:01:40.750> so<00:01:40.960> it

00:01:41.069 --> 00:01:41.079 
it's supposed to be line smoothing so it

00:01:41.079 --> 00:01:42.539 
it's supposed to be line smoothing so it
helps<00:01:41.350> fill<00:01:41.560> in<00:01:41.619> your<00:01:41.829> lines<00:01:42.040> a<00:01:42.220> bit<00:01:42.399> which

00:01:42.539 --> 00:01:42.549 
helps fill in your lines a bit which

00:01:42.549 --> 00:01:44.069 
helps fill in your lines a bit which
actually<00:01:42.939> I<00:01:42.969> noticed<00:01:43.360> that<00:01:43.479> it<00:01:43.600> does<00:01:43.780> some

00:01:44.069 --> 00:01:44.079
