00:02:04.690 --> 00:02:04.700 
basically there are two different types

00:02:04.700 --> 00:02:07.600 
basically there are two different types
of<00:02:05.090> water<00:02:05.330> meter<00:02:05.720> there's<00:02:06.380> an<00:02:06.590> inline<00:02:07.160> meter

00:02:07.600 --> 00:02:07.610 
of water meter there's an inline meter

00:02:07.610 --> 00:02:09.910 
of water meter there's an inline meter
with<00:02:08.240> a<00:02:08.270> meters<00:02:08.660> lying<00:02:09.080> on<00:02:09.259> its<00:02:09.410> side<00:02:09.500> like

00:02:09.910 --> 00:02:09.920 
with a meters lying on its side like

00:02:09.920 --> 00:02:12.010 
with a meters lying on its side like
this<00:02:10.099> one<00:02:10.340> is<00:02:10.550> with<00:02:10.910> the<00:02:11.030> pipes<00:02:11.270> coming<00:02:11.660> either

00:02:12.010 --> 00:02:12.020 
this one is with the pipes coming either

00:02:12.020 --> 00:02:16.210 
this one is with the pipes coming either
side<00:02:12.380> and<00:02:12.709> then<00:02:13.280> underneath<00:02:14.150> this<00:02:14.569> plant<00:02:15.319> is<00:02:15.590> a

00:02:16.210 --> 00:02:16.220 
side and then underneath this plant is a

00:02:16.220 --> 00:02:20.820 
side and then underneath this plant is a
tap<00:02:16.640> now<00:02:17.300> what<00:02:17.569> metro<00:02:18.020> water<00:02:18.260> do<00:02:18.650> is<00:02:19.390> they<00:02:20.390> turn

00:02:20.820 --> 00:02:20.830 
tap now what metro water do is they turn

00:02:20.830 --> 00:02:24.339 
tap now what metro water do is they turn
turn<00:02:21.830> the<00:02:22.130> tap<00:02:22.459> down<00:02:23.270> so<00:02:23.870> there's<00:02:24.080> very<00:02:24.290> little

00:02:24.339 --> 00:02:24.349 
turn the tap down so there's very little

00:02:24.349 --> 00:02:26.559 
turn the tap down so there's very little
water<00:02:24.590> coming<00:02:25.220> in<00:02:25.370> and<00:02:25.580> then<00:02:25.819> they<00:02:26.000> clamp<00:02:26.420> it

00:02:26.559 --> 00:02:26.569 
water coming in and then they clamp it

00:02:26.569 --> 00:02:28.900 
water coming in and then they clamp it
so<00:02:26.750> you<00:02:26.950> the<00:02:27.950> idea<00:02:28.310> is<00:02:28.400> they're<00:02:28.550> trying<00:02:28.700> to

00:02:28.900 --> 00:02:28.910 
so you the idea is they're trying to

00:02:28.910 --> 00:02:30.880 
so you the idea is they're trying to
stop<00:02:29.150> you<00:02:29.300> getting<00:02:29.480> access<00:02:29.959> to<00:02:30.020> the<00:02:30.319> tap<00:02:30.560> to

00:02:30.880 --> 00:02:30.890 
stop you getting access to the tap to

00:02:30.890 --> 00:02:33.700 
stop you getting access to the tap to
turn<00:02:31.099> it<00:02:31.310> on<00:02:31.599> there<00:02:32.599> is<00:02:32.720> just<00:02:32.959> a<00:02:33.080> tiny

00:02:33.700 --> 00:02:33.710 
turn it on there is just a tiny

00:02:33.710 --> 00:02:37.750 
turn it on there is just a tiny
a<00:02:33.760> flow<00:02:34.760> that<00:02:35.150> comes<00:02:35.450> out<00:02:35.720> too<00:02:35.960> tiny<00:02:36.230> a<00:02:36.950> tiny

00:02:37.750 --> 00:02:37.760 
a flow that comes out too tiny a tiny

00:02:37.760 --> 00:02:40.530 
a flow that comes out too tiny a tiny
little<00:02:38.420> trickle

00:02:40.530 --> 00:02:40.540 
little trickle

00:02:40.540 --> 00:02:44.500 
little trickle
that<00:02:41.540> is<00:02:41.720> how<00:02:41.960> Metro<00:02:42.740> also<00:02:43.040> tried<00:02:43.550> to<00:02:43.580> enforce

00:02:44.500 --> 00:02:44.510 
that is how Metro also tried to enforce

00:02:44.510 --> 00:02:46.990 
that is how Metro also tried to enforce
payment<00:02:45.200> of<00:02:45.470> their<00:02:45.800> dispute<00:02:46.310> errs<00:02:46.430> and<00:02:46.610> their

00:02:50.710 --> 00:02:50.720 
highly inflated extortionist bills so

00:02:50.720 --> 00:02:53.110 
highly inflated extortionist bills so
when<00:02:51.440> you<00:02:51.590> have<00:02:51.860> a<00:02:52.040> meter<00:02:52.400> which<00:02:52.670> has<00:02:52.880> been

00:02:53.110 --> 00:02:53.120 
when you have a meter which has been

00:02:53.120 --> 00:02:56.080 
when you have a meter which has been
clamped<00:02:53.870> as<00:02:54.020> this<00:02:54.590> one<00:02:54.860> is<00:02:55.040> there<00:02:55.760> are

00:02:56.080 --> 00:02:56.090 
clamped as this one is there are

00:02:56.090 --> 00:02:58.300 
clamped as this one is there are
different<00:02:56.630> things<00:02:56.810> you<00:02:56.990> can<00:02:57.620> do<00:02:57.890> to<00:02:58.160> get

00:02:58.300 --> 00:02:58.310 
different things you can do to get

00:02:58.310 --> 00:03:01.660 
different things you can do to get
around<00:02:58.610> the<00:02:59.000> clamping<00:02:59.510> you<00:02:59.870> can<00:03:00.670> sometimes

00:03:01.660 --> 00:03:01.670 
around the clamping you can sometimes

00:03:01.670 --> 00:03:05.140 
around the clamping you can sometimes
get<00:03:02.180> your<00:03:02.420> hand<00:03:02.750> underneath<00:03:03.250> the<00:03:04.250> clamp<00:03:04.610> and

00:03:05.140 --> 00:03:05.150 
get your hand underneath the clamp and

00:03:05.150 --> 00:03:09.160 
get your hand underneath the clamp and
if<00:03:05.870> the<00:03:06.020> tap<00:03:06.290> is<00:03:06.500> loose<00:03:06.830> the<00:03:07.580> tip<00:03:07.880> turns<00:03:08.870> on

00:03:09.160 --> 00:03:09.170 
if the tap is loose the tip turns on

00:03:09.170 --> 00:03:11.250 
if the tap is loose the tip turns on
this<00:03:09.350> way<00:03:09.650> so<00:03:10.160> you<00:03:10.220> get<00:03:10.460> your<00:03:10.670> hand<00:03:10.910> underneath

00:03:11.250 --> 00:03:11.260 
this way so you get your hand underneath

00:03:11.260 --> 00:03:14.610 
this way so you get your hand underneath
get<00:03:12.260> under<00:03:12.890> the<00:03:13.010> tap<00:03:13.310> and<00:03:13.490> turn<00:03:14.030> it<00:03:14.270> around

00:03:14.610 --> 00:03:14.620 
get under the tap and turn it around

00:03:14.620 --> 00:03:18.700 
get under the tap and turn it around
which<00:03:15.620> makes<00:03:16.250> the<00:03:16.760> clamp<00:03:17.060> a<00:03:17.390> bit<00:03:17.900> useless<00:03:18.200> and

00:03:18.700 --> 00:03:18.710 
which makes the clamp a bit useless and

00:03:18.710 --> 00:03:21.400 
which makes the clamp a bit useless and
your<00:03:18.860> water<00:03:19.040> is<00:03:19.190> back<00:03:19.370> on<00:03:19.580> if<00:03:20.030> you<00:03:20.300> can't<00:03:20.690> get

00:03:21.400 --> 00:03:21.410 
your water is back on if you can't get

00:03:21.410 --> 00:03:25.030 
your water is back on if you can't get

underneath to access the tap then you

00:03:25.040 --> 00:03:27.220 
underneath to access the tap then you
need<00:03:25.250> to<00:03:25.430> remove<00:03:25.820> the<00:03:26.060> clamp<00:03:26.420> it's<00:03:26.840> held<00:03:27.140> in

place by a padlock you could use an

00:03:30.080 --> 00:03:32.860 
place by a padlock you could use an
angle<00:03:30.530> grinder<00:03:30.770> to<00:03:31.520> cut<00:03:31.550> through<00:03:32.270> the<00:03:32.420> padlock
