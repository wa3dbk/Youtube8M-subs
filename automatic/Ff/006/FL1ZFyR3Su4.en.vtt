00:00:12.770 --> 00:00:12.780 
themselves inside the windows you most

00:00:12.780 --> 00:00:14.330 
themselves inside the windows you most
likely<00:00:13.049> have<00:00:13.290> tried<00:00:13.590> the<00:00:13.769> things<00:00:14.009> that<00:00:14.190> I've

00:00:14.330 --> 00:00:14.340

tried and you have come to the

00:00:15.690 --> 00:00:18.320 
tried and you have come to the
conclusions<00:00:16.289> that<00:00:16.460> it<00:00:17.460> has<00:00:17.640> something<00:00:17.940> to<00:00:18.119> do

00:00:18.320 --> 00:00:18.330

00:00:24.800 --> 00:00:24.810 
windows media play a library file and

00:00:24.810 --> 00:00:27.650 
windows media play a library file and
you<00:00:24.900> have<00:00:24.990> tried<00:00:25.230> a<00:00:25.970> different<00:00:26.970> kinds<00:00:27.570> of

00:00:27.650 --> 00:00:27.660 
you have tried a different kinds of

other solutions but none of them have

00:00:29.789 --> 00:00:31.820 
other solutions but none of them have
worked<00:00:30.090> the<00:00:30.779> reason<00:00:31.199> for<00:00:31.349> that<00:00:31.410> of<00:00:31.740> course

00:00:31.820 --> 00:00:31.830 
worked the reason for that of course

00:00:31.830 --> 00:00:34.430 
worked the reason for that of course
being<00:00:32.460> that<00:00:32.730> it's<00:00:33.000> not<00:00:33.600> really<00:00:33.899> the<00:00:34.230> problem

00:00:34.430 --> 00:00:34.440 
being that it's not really the problem

my music folder inside the windows I
have<00:01:18.570> that<00:01:18.720> system<00:01:18.960> here<00:01:19.920> is<00:01:20.130> my<00:01:20.369> music<00:01:20.909> it

00:01:21.770 --> 00:01:21.780 
have that system here is my music it

00:01:21.780 --> 00:01:25.010 
have that system here is my music it
lines<00:01:22.439> within<00:01:22.770> a<00:01:23.100> lot<00:01:23.400> of<00:01:23.670> different<00:01:24.509> folders

00:01:25.010 --> 00:01:25.020 
lines within a lot of different folders

00:01:25.020 --> 00:01:30.740 
lines within a lot of different folders
and<00:01:26.689> the<00:01:27.689> problem<00:01:28.409> lies<00:01:28.740> within<00:01:29.460> that<00:01:29.759> I<00:01:30.240> have

00:01:30.740 --> 00:01:30.750 
and the problem lies within that I have

00:01:30.750 --> 00:01:34.819 
and the problem lies within that I have
an<00:01:30.900> album<00:01:31.079> right<00:01:31.439> here<00:01:31.770> in<00:01:33.229> my<00:01:34.229> music<00:01:34.619> folder

00:01:34.819 --> 00:01:34.829 
an album right here in my music folder

00:01:34.829 --> 00:01:38.749 
an album right here in my music folder
but<00:01:35.670> that<00:01:36.090> album<00:01:37.079> also<00:01:37.619> is<00:01:37.740> in<00:01:37.920> the<00:01:38.040> list<00:01:38.280> right

00:01:38.749 --> 00:01:38.759 
but that album also is in the list right

00:01:38.759 --> 00:01:39.170 
but that album also is in the list right
here

00:01:39.170 --> 00:01:39.180 
here

00:01:39.180 --> 00:01:41.420 
here
so<00:01:39.630> it's<00:01:39.840> duplicated<00:01:40.680> and<00:01:40.829> that's<00:01:41.009> why

00:01:41.420 --> 00:01:41.430 
so it's duplicated and that's why

00:01:41.430 --> 00:01:43.760 
so it's duplicated and that's why
windows<00:01:41.970> wants<00:01:42.540> to<00:01:42.720> duplicate<00:01:43.229> it<00:01:43.350> it's<00:01:43.590> in

00:01:43.760 --> 00:01:43.770 
windows wants to duplicate it it's in

00:01:43.770 --> 00:01:46.999 
windows wants to duplicate it it's in
the<00:01:43.890> list<00:01:44.040> two<00:01:44.280> times<00:01:44.579> so<00:01:45.540> what<00:01:45.869> you<00:01:46.530> need<00:01:46.770> to

00:01:46.999 --> 00:01:47.009 
the list two times so what you need to

00:01:47.009 --> 00:01:49.609 
the list two times so what you need to
do<00:01:47.250> to<00:01:47.729> get<00:01:47.880> the<00:01:48.149> rid<00:01:48.420> of<00:01:48.659> this<00:01:48.810> problem<00:01:49.500> and

00:01:49.609 --> 00:01:49.619 
do to get the rid of this problem and

00:01:49.619 --> 00:01:52.370 
do to get the rid of this problem and
those<00:01:49.799> files<00:01:50.250> to<00:01:50.520> duplicate<00:01:51.360> themselves<00:01:51.630> is

00:01:52.370 --> 00:01:52.380 
those files to duplicate themselves is

00:01:52.380 --> 00:01:55.789 
those files to duplicate themselves is
just<00:01:52.740> to<00:01:52.890> get<00:01:53.220> rid<00:01:53.549> of<00:01:53.610> them<00:01:54.000> ones<00:01:54.630> I<00:01:54.960> mean<00:01:55.350> you

00:01:55.789 --> 00:01:55.799 
just to get rid of them ones I mean you

00:01:55.799 --> 00:01:59.090 
just to get rid of them ones I mean you
have<00:01:56.009> of<00:01:56.250> course<00:01:56.490> you<00:01:57.390> have<00:01:57.600> to<00:01:57.869> know<00:01:58.770> where
