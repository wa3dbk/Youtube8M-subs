00:00:00.140 --> 00:00:03.449
 good evening welcome to one 

00:00:01.949 --> 00:00:04.830
 press conference after the end of the 

00:00:03.449 --> 00:00:07.379
 contest for you the city fc 

00:00:04.830 --> 00:00:09.929
 rkc waalwijk next to the bee the genus 

00:00:07.379 --> 00:00:11.040
 the here fred grim and godfather of the mountains 

00:00:09.929 --> 00:00:14.509
 and the latter 

00:00:11.040 --> 00:00:18.300
 I would like to pass on thank you 

00:00:14.509 --> 00:00:19.260
 match then international weekend where 

00:00:18.300 --> 00:00:22.920
 the 

00:00:19.260 --> 00:00:28.199
 yes and the very good one in the week got me 

00:00:22.920 --> 00:00:30.300
 just through training and that you 

00:00:28.199 --> 00:00:31.710
 it looks slow on the team 

00:00:30.300 --> 00:00:36.000
 from hecke c 

00:00:31.710 --> 00:00:37.530
 The Fastnesses Fastnesses Influence Buy 

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:39.570
 which always starts with at good 

00:00:37.530 --> 00:00:40.829
 oh complete organization we are 

00:00:39.570 --> 00:00:41.640
 actually can get rid of it 

00:00:40.829 --> 00:00:46.200
 been busy 

00:00:41.640 --> 00:00:48.750
 and ultimately we will try to 

00:00:46.200 --> 00:00:51.690
 feel more in it 

00:00:48.750 --> 00:00:52.530
 bringing in the team is successful 

00:00:51.690 --> 00:00:53.879
 flurries 

00:00:52.530 --> 00:00:56.399
 that is not good enough but there 

00:00:53.879 --> 00:00:58.289
 are we coming well i get a very fast one 

00:00:56.399 --> 00:01:00.980
 lead from an ounce 

00:00:58.289 --> 00:01:00.980
 switching moment 

00:01:01.649 --> 00:01:05.850
 and then you hold it tight for a long time 

00:01:03.780 --> 00:01:08.130
 almere and 

00:01:05.850 --> 00:01:09.840
 just before the break get the call against 

00:01:08.130 --> 00:01:13.140
 1st 

00:01:09.840 --> 00:01:16.140
 and own area here on the one two and that 

00:01:13.140 --> 00:01:19.830
 I think that is really great about this team 

00:01:16.140 --> 00:01:21.360
 you can see that it used to be that way 

00:01:19.830 --> 00:01:22.979
 as a goal against you that the team 

00:01:21.360 --> 00:01:25.770
 each other plunged me now stayed upright 

00:01:22.979 --> 00:01:28.170
 stand we make the 2nd directly to rest 

00:01:25.770 --> 00:01:30.200
 we get the text by number again 

00:01:28.170 --> 00:01:34.799
 fantastic free kick kick also ruth 

00:01:30.200 --> 00:01:36.299
 fantastic in the intersection 

00:01:34.799 --> 00:01:38.220
 compacted 

00:01:36.299 --> 00:01:41.460
 2 2 again a damper actually for 

00:01:38.220 --> 00:01:43.350
 our team and we resist and we 

00:01:41.460 --> 00:01:44.700
 actually make the three two on a whole 

00:01:43.350 --> 00:01:46.950
 good time and for the rest of the 

00:01:44.700 --> 00:01:48.930
 almere is a bit threatening 

00:01:46.950 --> 00:01:50.850
 but I also think if you get the chance 

00:01:48.930 --> 00:01:53.720
 relationships looks at the real big ones 

00:01:50.850 --> 00:01:56.030
 chances are that we might already have a rest 

00:01:53.720 --> 00:02:00.380
 get to the 0 and get it 

00:01:56.030 --> 00:02:01.190
 big chance of 0 2 who miss me then and 

00:02:00.380 --> 00:02:03.380
 that's a shame 

00:02:01.190 --> 00:02:06.560
 and then you get the lid on the nose 

00:02:03.380 --> 00:02:09.709
 but clearly having the two three 

00:02:06.560 --> 00:02:12.140
 again defended their right and 

00:02:09.709 --> 00:02:15.400
 we have a very nice victory 

00:02:12.140 --> 00:02:15.400
 on saxo for the Easter days 

00:02:15.620 --> 00:02:20.090
 my restaurants go beyond Fred Heel 

00:02:17.959 --> 00:02:22.660
 good luck with his team at 

00:02:20.090 --> 00:02:22.660
 the after competition 

00:02:23.060 --> 00:02:28.250
 that's not ok sir van de burgh then 

00:02:25.220 --> 00:02:30.290
 bronze now give the word to fred grim 

00:02:28.250 --> 00:02:33.709
 yes tonight was actually one for us 

00:02:30.290 --> 00:02:35.269
 competition for after five matches 3 

00:02:33.709 --> 00:02:38.959
 draws and two losses 

00:02:35.269 --> 00:02:40.280
 three points here 

00:02:38.959 --> 00:02:43.370
 well we have that from the start 

00:02:40.280 --> 00:02:45.440
 tried to exude an honor 

00:02:43.370 --> 00:02:48.050
 defend ahead also sir with one 

00:02:45.440 --> 00:02:50.000
 to play number 10, that's us 

00:02:48.050 --> 00:02:52.580
 normally not used but we 

00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:53.030
 especially want to see how that how that us 

00:02:52.580 --> 00:02:55.760
 lies 

00:02:53.030 --> 00:02:59.150
 well i have to honestly say that 

00:02:55.760 --> 00:03:01.280
 not you completely failed is only you 

00:02:59.150 --> 00:03:02.690
 just know that if you play against rcc 

00:03:01.280 --> 00:03:04.670
 in the last matches we have 

00:03:02.690 --> 00:03:06.709
 seen naturally and that is very compact 

00:03:04.670 --> 00:03:09.590
 and some people in their own half 

00:03:06.709 --> 00:03:11.040
 indeed to the defensive 

00:03:09.590 --> 00:03:12.810
 organisation of 

00:03:11.040 --> 00:03:14.340
 they are and then it is just whole 

00:03:12.810 --> 00:03:17.609
 difficult to get through it 

00:03:14.340 --> 00:03:20.310
 especially if we are not in the right 

00:03:17.609 --> 00:03:22.469
 do of a few weeks 

00:03:20.310 --> 00:03:24.209
 ago in which a great position game 

00:03:22.469 --> 00:03:25.769
 could play in which the free men 

00:03:24.209 --> 00:03:28.920
 could find the chance off 

00:03:25.769 --> 00:03:31.319
 flowers and then it is just very difficult 

00:03:28.920 --> 00:03:34.980
 then you bother yourself at the moment 

00:03:31.319 --> 00:03:36.780
 your unnecessary loss of the ball is not good 

00:03:34.980 --> 00:03:37.889
 acted in a number of situations 

00:03:36.780 --> 00:03:39.359
 making you just 

00:03:37.889 --> 00:03:41.849
 simply simple calls 

00:03:39.359 --> 00:03:43.530
 yes then you will just get one 

00:03:41.849 --> 00:03:46.530
 very annoying evening 

00:03:43.530 --> 00:03:47.849
 and indeed the odds have been before 

00:03:46.530 --> 00:03:50.069
 rkc 

00:03:47.849 --> 00:03:52.230
 but there certainly was no second chance 

00:03:50.069 --> 00:03:54.930
 peter and refer it is just stupid 

00:03:52.230 --> 00:03:58.049
 ball loss in midfield and if you 

00:03:54.930 --> 00:04:01.439
 that if you are not 100% concentrated there 

00:03:58.049 --> 00:04:04.560
 are in and you do not handle well then 

00:04:01.439 --> 00:04:07.319
 just give away too many options 

00:04:04.560 --> 00:04:08.760
 and then you follow the facts 

00:04:07.319 --> 00:04:10.859
 I think we just rest for a 

00:04:08.760 --> 00:04:12.900
 good time to make the 1st 

00:04:10.859 --> 00:04:14.939
 when you see that you have two minutes 

00:04:12.900 --> 00:04:17.250
 later again just for rest just the one 

00:04:14.939 --> 00:04:19.829
 two to yes then you should have your 

00:04:17.250 --> 00:04:21.329
 just blame yourself and we 

00:04:19.829 --> 00:04:23.820
 the images will go back anyway 

00:04:21.329 --> 00:04:25.440
 and then you will see that it is it 

00:04:23.820 --> 00:04:26.699
 are just individual errors and 

00:04:25.440 --> 00:04:28.740
 they have to get out 

00:04:26.699 --> 00:04:30.030
 we want to mean something later in 

00:04:28.740 --> 00:04:32.280
 in the after competition 

00:04:30.030 --> 00:04:34.919
 right after rest I know great 

00:04:32.280 --> 00:04:36.630
 now we come into the game 

00:04:34.919 --> 00:04:39.000
 that moment i also got the idea that we 

00:04:36.630 --> 00:04:41.880
 more by pressing could make the cocoon 

00:04:39.000 --> 00:04:44.760
 yes when you see how ready bro 

00:04:41.880 --> 00:04:47.340
 can connect the ball free of birds and also 

00:04:44.760 --> 00:04:49.020
 still the pass actually without any 

00:04:47.340 --> 00:04:50.400
 pressure can be given 

00:04:49.020 --> 00:04:52.320
 yes then we really have to do this to ourselves 

00:04:50.400 --> 00:04:53.400
 Search 

00:04:52.320 --> 00:04:55.080
 there is something we are going to work on 

00:04:53.400 --> 00:04:57.000
 what we can really get to work on 

00:04:55.080 --> 00:04:59.970
 must and the must at least for the 

00:04:57.000 --> 00:05:01.980
 better work on the coming weeks 

00:04:59.970 --> 00:05:04.590
