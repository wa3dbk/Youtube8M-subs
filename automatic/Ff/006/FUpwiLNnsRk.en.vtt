was<00:00:58.500> gonna<00:00:58.680> be<00:00:58.890> involved<00:00:59.309> with<00:00:59.430> this<00:00:59.579> and<00:01:00.000> it's

00:01:00.170 --> 00:01:00.180 
was gonna be involved with this and it's

00:01:00.180 --> 00:01:02.750 
was gonna be involved with this and it's
not<00:01:00.359> easy<00:01:00.690> to<00:01:01.050> do<00:01:01.260> because<00:01:01.500> especially<00:01:02.370> like

00:01:02.750 --> 00:01:02.760 
not easy to do because especially like

00:01:02.760 --> 00:01:04.310 
not easy to do because especially like
around<00:01:03.000> the<00:01:03.120> edges<00:01:03.600> as<00:01:03.719> you<00:01:03.750> can<00:01:03.989> see<00:01:04.170> right

00:01:04.310 --> 00:01:04.320 
around the edges as you can see right

00:01:04.320 --> 00:01:05.870 
around the edges as you can see right
here<00:01:04.379> if<00:01:04.680> you<00:01:04.799> hit<00:01:04.949> this<00:01:05.129> a<00:01:05.189> little<00:01:05.460> too<00:01:05.610> hard

00:01:05.870 --> 00:01:05.880 
here if you hit this a little too hard

00:01:05.880 --> 00:01:07.340 
here if you hit this a little too hard
with<00:01:06.060> the<00:01:06.150> sandpaper<00:01:06.600> you'll<00:01:06.930> knock<00:01:07.170> the

00:01:07.340 --> 00:01:07.350 
with the sandpaper you'll knock the

00:01:07.350 --> 00:01:10.490 
with the sandpaper you'll knock the
stuff<00:01:07.590> off<00:01:07.799> entirely<00:01:08.250> and<00:01:08.960> there's<00:01:09.960> also<00:01:10.200> an

00:01:10.490 --> 00:01:10.500 
stuff off entirely and there's also an

00:01:10.500 --> 00:01:12.410 
stuff off entirely and there's also an
example<00:01:10.979> of<00:01:11.070> that<00:01:11.189> where<00:01:11.400> happen<00:01:11.850> up<00:01:11.970> here<00:01:12.000> and

00:01:12.410 --> 00:01:12.420 
example of that where happen up here and

00:01:12.420 --> 00:01:14.570 
example of that where happen up here and
here's<00:01:12.570> a<00:01:12.630> spot<00:01:13.080> where<00:01:13.710> I<00:01:13.740> guess<00:01:14.220> I<00:01:14.369> just

00:01:14.570 --> 00:01:14.580 
here's a spot where I guess I just

00:01:14.580 --> 00:01:15.890 
here's a spot where I guess I just
didn't<00:01:14.850> put<00:01:15.000> enough<00:01:15.060> of<00:01:15.600> it<00:01:15.689> on<00:01:15.810> the

00:01:15.890 --> 00:01:15.900 
didn't put enough of it on the

00:01:15.900 --> 00:01:18.499 
didn't put enough of it on the
countertop<00:01:16.259> right<00:01:16.650> here<00:01:16.830> now<00:01:17.040> again<00:01:17.909> maybe

00:01:18.499 --> 00:01:18.509 
countertop right here now again maybe

00:01:18.509 --> 00:01:19.730 
countertop right here now again maybe
that's<00:01:18.780> my<00:01:19.110> fault

00:01:19.730 --> 00:01:19.740 
that's my fault

00:01:19.740 --> 00:01:22.219 
that's my fault
but<00:01:20.009> I'm<00:01:20.759> not<00:01:21.030> new<00:01:21.299> to<00:01:21.509> home<00:01:21.720> repair<00:01:21.900> and

not only that the kitchen if you look at
the<00:01:33.450> floor<00:01:33.720> I<00:01:34.020> mean<00:01:34.259> the<00:01:35.189> house<00:01:35.430> is<00:01:35.759> a<00:01:35.790> mess

00:01:37.969 --> 00:01:37.979 
here in the kitchen area because of this

00:01:37.979 --> 00:01:40.039 
here in the kitchen area because of this
the<00:01:38.280> stuff<00:01:38.939> it's<00:01:39.119> like<00:01:39.270> sand<00:01:39.720> and<00:01:39.869> it's

00:01:40.049 --> 00:01:44.060 
the stuff it's like sand and it's
everywhere<00:01:40.590> so<00:01:42.140> my<00:01:43.140> recommendation<00:01:43.890> if<00:01:43.979> you

00:01:44.060 --> 00:01:44.070

everywhere so my recommendation if you
need<00:01:44.220> new<00:01:44.250> countertops<00:01:45.000> spend<00:01:45.659> the<00:01:45.780> extra<00:01:45.930> 60

00:01:46.520 --> 00:01:46.530 
need new countertops spend the extra 60

00:01:46.530 --> 00:01:47.990 
need new countertops spend the extra 60
