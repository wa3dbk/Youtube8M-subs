 learn in the next five minutes 

00:00:03.900 --> 00:00:08.340
 you how you can achieve more sales 

00:00:06.420 --> 00:00:12.410
 while at the same time they cost 

00:00:08.340 --> 00:00:15.480
 Lower your 3d data with 3dvia 

00:00:12.410 --> 00:00:17.820
 Use composer again instead of everything 

00:00:15.480 --> 00:00:19.890
 to recreate product manuals 

00:00:17.820 --> 00:00:22.349
 catalogs montage and 

00:00:19.890 --> 00:00:24.270
 repair instructions sales and 

00:00:22.349 --> 00:00:26.029
 training videos as well as others 

00:00:24.270 --> 00:00:27.930
 Documentations are for your 

00:00:26.029 --> 00:00:30.090
 manufacturing operations more important than ever 

00:00:27.930 --> 00:00:32.340
 meanwhile, offer their competitors 

00:00:30.090 --> 00:00:34.620
 the customers a whole new kind of 

00:00:32.340 --> 00:00:35.519
 interactive documentation about the 

00:00:34.620 --> 00:00:38.510
 internet on 

00:00:35.519 --> 00:00:41.339
 the question is how can you get bigger 

00:00:38.510 --> 00:00:43.530
 Documentation faster better 

00:00:41.339 --> 00:00:46.530
 and create more cost-effective 

00:00:43.530 --> 00:00:50.219
 3dvia composer is the solution 

00:00:46.530 --> 00:00:52.469
 3dvia composer is a 3d software with 

00:00:50.219 --> 00:00:54.769
 which you have high quality product 

00:00:52.469 --> 00:00:58.199
 graphics and interactive animations 

00:00:54.769 --> 00:01:00.780
 directly from the 3d data can create 

00:00:58.199 --> 00:01:03.629
 who are your designers and engineers in 

00:01:00.780 --> 00:01:05.759
 developed their cad systems that is 

00:01:03.629 --> 00:01:08.159
 much more efficient than the new one 

00:01:05.759 --> 00:01:10.740
 will create documentation after the 

00:01:08.159 --> 00:01:13.020
 Production of the product by direct 

00:01:10.740 --> 00:01:15.810
 connection between the cad programs 

00:01:13.020 --> 00:01:18.030
 and 3dvia composer remains theirs 

00:01:15.810 --> 00:01:20.909
 documentation always up to date 

00:01:18.030 --> 00:01:24.079
 stand with 3dvia composer you can 

00:01:20.909 --> 00:01:26.729
 high quality illustrations 

00:01:24.079 --> 00:01:30.600
 photorealistic graphics interactive 

00:01:26.729 --> 00:01:32.789
 Generate 3d pdfs and videos you can 

00:01:30.600 --> 00:01:35.280
 not only faster and better documents 

00:01:32.789 --> 00:01:37.409
 create more cost-effective but also 

00:01:35.280 --> 00:01:40.680
 an interactive work with it 

00:01:37.409 --> 00:01:43.350
 allow the construction manager at 

00:01:40.680 --> 00:01:45.000
 aqualux limited in the uk could 

00:01:43.350 --> 00:01:49.740
 for example, the documentation time 

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:51.540
 with 3dvia composer by 25 to 40 percent 

00:01:49.740 --> 00:01:54.820
 reduce 

00:01:51.540 --> 00:01:56.800
 3dvia composer can work in all areas 

00:01:54.820 --> 00:01:58.950
 your company of technical 

00:01:56.800 --> 00:02:01.330
 editors manufacturing engineers 

00:01:58.950 --> 00:02:03.850
 technical service technician 

00:02:01.330 --> 00:02:04.810
 marketing department and designers 

00:02:03.850 --> 00:02:06.820
 is used 

00:02:04.810 --> 00:02:09.520
 There are no special skills 

00:02:06.820 --> 00:02:11.740
 we need to know how important it is 

00:02:09.520 --> 00:02:15.370
 to learn processes quickly 

00:02:11.740 --> 00:02:17.470
 that's why 3dvia composer works seamlessly 

00:02:15.370 --> 00:02:20.050
 with their existing documentation 

00:02:17.470 --> 00:02:22.870
 tools from microsoft adobe and 

00:02:20.050 --> 00:02:24.790
 other suppliers together 

00:02:22.870 --> 00:02:26.980
 processes do not have to be changed 

00:02:24.790 --> 00:02:29.170
 you can just speed it up 

00:02:26.980 --> 00:02:30.970
 even if you never use 3d software 

00:02:29.170 --> 00:02:33.160
 you can have worked 

00:02:30.970 --> 00:02:35.830
 Use by the simple structure 

00:02:33.160 --> 00:02:38.790
 intuitive interface in less than 

00:02:35.830 --> 00:02:41.020
 learn a day instead of static 

00:02:38.790 --> 00:02:43.030
 screen shots can be used 

00:02:41.020 --> 00:02:44.800
 she directly with write protected 3d 

00:02:43.030 --> 00:02:46.740
 Models work so that the 

00:02:44.800 --> 00:02:48.160
 original design data 

00:02:46.740 --> 00:02:50.170
 remain unchanged 

00:02:48.160 --> 00:02:53.080
 You can easily view with 

00:02:50.170 --> 00:02:55.870
 camera controls select parts and 

00:02:53.080 --> 00:02:57.940
 show colors change and the 

00:02:55.870 --> 00:02:59.950
 representation of any number of 

00:02:57.940 --> 00:03:01.989
 Modify components of the components 

00:02:59.950 --> 00:03:04.630
 move components with reference 

00:03:01.989 --> 00:03:07.239
 lines and solve them on create 

00:03:04.630 --> 00:03:08.320
 You add detail to notes 

00:03:07.239 --> 00:03:10.600
 and arrows added 

00:03:08.320 --> 00:03:12.459
 and all without experience with cad 

00:03:10.600 --> 00:03:15.519
 program you can within 

00:03:12.459 --> 00:03:17.739
 minutes without a digital camera digital 

00:03:15.519 --> 00:03:20.470
 albums and hundreds of graphics as 

00:03:17.739 --> 00:03:22.980
 Raster images or vector illustrations 

00:03:20.470 --> 00:03:22.980
 create 

00:03:23.120 --> 00:03:28.819
 with the reproduction tool of 3dvia 

00:03:25.909 --> 00:03:31.489
 composer you can increase productivity in 

00:03:28.819 --> 00:03:33.319
 The production increase your employees 

00:03:31.489 --> 00:03:36.650
 can be animated step by step 

00:03:33.319 --> 00:03:39.019
 View instructions pause and models 

00:03:36.650 --> 00:03:40.670
 rotate for better details 

00:03:39.019 --> 00:03:41.629
 recognize or even measure 

00:03:40.670 --> 00:03:44.060
 make 

00:03:41.629 --> 00:03:46.549
 the creation of the animations is 

00:03:44.060 --> 00:03:48.920
 they are surprisingly easy to pull 

00:03:46.549 --> 00:03:53.180
 easy views into the animation 

00:03:48.920 --> 00:03:55.940
 Timeline if there is a construction 

00:03:53.180 --> 00:03:57.910
 in the cad program will be changed parts 

00:03:55.940 --> 00:03:59.799
 geometry piece lists and 

00:03:57.910 --> 00:04:02.019
 custom properties 

00:03:59.799 --> 00:04:04.099
 automatically in the documentation 

00:04:02.019 --> 00:04:06.650
 updated that also applies to 

00:04:04.099 --> 00:04:08.870
 explosions views parts list 

00:04:06.650 --> 00:04:10.780
 captions and animations 

00:04:08.870 --> 00:04:13.069
 this is how they can begin 

00:04:10.780 --> 00:04:15.409
 Documentations and constructions 

00:04:13.069 --> 00:04:17.840
 to create in parallel without worrying 

00:04:15.409 --> 00:04:20.389
 to have to make later changes 

00:04:17.840 --> 00:04:22.039
 Our customer says hair is a manufacturer of 

00:04:20.389 --> 00:04:25.460
 machines for battery production 

00:04:22.039 --> 00:04:27.620
 Without 3d we reported composer and this 

00:04:25.460 --> 00:04:30.710
 animation would be very difficult for us 

00:04:27.620 --> 00:04:31.490
 been this contract over 700,000 euros 

00:04:30.710 --> 00:04:33.800
 to get 

00:04:31.490 --> 00:04:35.599
 globalization brings new ones 

00:04:33.800 --> 00:04:37.570
 Opportunities for the sale of 

00:04:35.599 --> 00:04:39.910
 However, products also increase 

00:04:37.570 --> 00:04:41.360
 language barriers that affect productivity 

00:04:39.910 --> 00:04:43.849
 can affect 

00:04:41.360 --> 00:04:45.680
 But pictures say in every language 

00:04:43.849 --> 00:04:49.550
 more than a thousand words 

00:04:45.680 --> 00:04:52.190
 that's why 3dvia composer offers customizable 

00:04:49.550 --> 00:04:54.289
 3d pdf templates with yours 

00:04:52.190 --> 00:04:56.150
 Employees easily assemble and 

00:04:54.289 --> 00:04:58.940
 understand the repair instructions 

00:04:56.150 --> 00:05:01.430
 be able to become products right the same 

00:04:58.940 --> 00:05:04.880
 Assembled and repaired quickly 

00:05:01.430 --> 00:05:06.889
 performed to get 3d viacom break 

00:05:04.880 --> 00:05:09.710
 you comprehensive support 

00:05:06.889 --> 00:05:11.349
 finished examples detailed step 

00:05:09.710 --> 00:05:14.000
 for step training manuals 

00:05:11.349 --> 00:05:16.280
 online video learning programs technical 

00:05:14.000 --> 00:05:18.050
 support and user forums are 

00:05:16.280 --> 00:05:20.419
 resources that you can count on 

00:05:18.050 --> 00:05:22.169
 if you have documents within narrow 

00:05:20.419 --> 00:05:25.710
 set periods 

00:05:22.169 --> 00:05:27.889
 3dvia composer may need her 

00:05:25.710 --> 00:05:29.969
 companies help faster 

00:05:27.889 --> 00:05:32.310
 cheaper documentation too 

00:05:29.969 --> 00:05:36.770
 create and a more sophisticated 

00:05:32.310 --> 00:05:36.770
 to provide interactive user experience
