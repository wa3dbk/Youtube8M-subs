and<00:00:00.120> as<00:00:00.599> I<00:00:00.750> promised<00:00:01.170> I'm<00:00:01.380> gonna<00:00:01.680> show<00:00:01.920> you<00:00:01.979> the

00:00:02.180 --> 00:00:02.190 
and as I promised I'm gonna show you the

00:00:02.190 --> 00:00:05.749 
and as I promised I'm gonna show you the
results<00:00:02.310> of<00:00:02.820> my<00:00:03.389> cleaning<00:00:03.870> of<00:00:04.140> the<00:00:04.500> shutter<00:00:05.460> of

00:00:05.749 --> 00:00:05.759 
results of my cleaning of the shutter of

00:00:05.759 --> 00:00:10.780 
results of my cleaning of the shutter of
this<00:00:06.089> canon<00:00:06.839> eos<00:00:07.230> 10's<00:00:08.960> this<00:00:09.960> is<00:00:10.080> the<00:00:10.200> next<00:00:10.469> day

00:00:10.780 --> 00:00:10.790 
this canon eos 10's this is the next day

00:00:10.790 --> 00:00:14.480 
this canon eos 10's this is the next day
and<00:00:11.790> the<00:00:11.880> reason<00:00:12.030> I<00:00:12.360> kind<00:00:13.320> of<00:00:13.349> waited<00:00:13.559> some

00:00:14.480 --> 00:00:14.490 
and the reason I kind of waited some

00:00:14.490 --> 00:00:17.359 
and the reason I kind of waited some
time<00:00:14.519> is<00:00:15.089> to<00:00:15.420> give<00:00:16.289> a<00:00:16.320> chance<00:00:16.590> for<00:00:16.980> all<00:00:17.039> the

00:00:17.359 --> 00:00:17.369 
time is to give a chance for all the

00:00:17.369 --> 00:00:20.029 
time is to give a chance for all the
solvent<00:00:18.029> that<00:00:18.150> we<00:00:18.330> used<00:00:18.660> while<00:00:19.590> cleaning<00:00:19.800> out

00:00:20.029 --> 00:00:20.039 
solvent that we used while cleaning out

00:00:20.039 --> 00:00:25.009 
solvent that we used while cleaning out
the<00:00:20.570> the<00:00:21.570> black<00:00:21.810> guitar<00:00:22.519> to<00:00:23.519> off<00:00:24.330> gas<00:00:24.720> and

00:00:25.009 --> 00:00:25.019 
the the black guitar to off gas and

00:00:25.019 --> 00:00:28.490 
the the black guitar to off gas and
evaporate<00:00:26.390> so<00:00:27.390> I<00:00:27.420> can<00:00:27.599> give<00:00:27.750> you<00:00:27.779> a<00:00:27.930> good<00:00:28.230> test

00:00:28.490 --> 00:00:28.500 
evaporate so I can give you a good test

00:00:28.500 --> 00:00:31.510 
evaporate so I can give you a good test
of<00:00:28.740> how<00:00:28.949> the<00:00:29.010> shutter<00:00:29.310> performs<00:00:29.789> now

00:00:31.510 --> 00:00:31.520 
of how the shutter performs now

00:00:31.520 --> 00:00:34.069 
of how the shutter performs now
cosmetically<00:00:32.520> if<00:00:33.270> you<00:00:33.390> want<00:00:33.540> to<00:00:33.600> take<00:00:33.750> a<00:00:33.780> look

00:00:34.069 --> 00:00:34.079 
cosmetically if you want to take a look

00:00:34.079 --> 00:00:37.819 
cosmetically if you want to take a look
you<00:00:34.980> can<00:00:35.010> see<00:00:35.160> the<00:00:35.670> shutter<00:00:36.380> has<00:00:37.380> some

00:00:37.819 --> 00:00:37.829 
you can see the shutter has some

00:00:37.829 --> 00:00:42.229 
you can see the shutter has some
cleaning<00:00:38.399> marks<00:00:38.760> on<00:00:38.940> it<00:00:39.120> but<00:00:40.550> no<00:00:41.550> tar<00:00:41.850> is

00:00:42.229 --> 00:00:42.239 
cleaning marks on it but no tar is

00:00:42.239 --> 00:00:46.819 
cleaning marks on it but no tar is
remains<00:00:43.460> and<00:00:44.460> if<00:00:44.969> you<00:00:45.149> check<00:00:45.780> out<00:00:45.960> the<00:00:46.289> other

00:00:46.819 --> 00:00:46.829 
remains and if you check out the other

00:00:46.829 --> 00:00:50.319 
remains and if you check out the other
side<00:00:47.190> here<00:00:47.700> I'm<00:00:48.629> not<00:00:48.840> sure<00:00:49.170> we<00:00:49.440> can<00:00:49.620> get<00:00:49.829> it

00:00:50.319 --> 00:00:50.329 
side here I'm not sure we can get it

00:00:50.329 --> 00:00:55.100 
side here I'm not sure we can get it
good<00:00:51.329> picture<00:00:51.780> in<00:00:51.930> there<00:00:52.079> but<00:00:53.690> you<00:00:54.690> can<00:00:54.840> see

00:00:55.100 --> 00:00:55.110 
good picture in there but you can see

00:00:55.110 --> 00:00:58.369 
good picture in there but you can see
it's<00:00:55.949> just<00:00:56.160> about<00:00:56.340> the<00:00:56.489> same<00:00:56.960> you<00:00:57.960> can<00:00:58.140> see<00:00:58.350> a

00:00:58.369 --> 00:00:58.379 
it's just about the same you can see a

00:00:58.379 --> 00:00:59.930 
it's just about the same you can see a
little<00:00:58.559> bit<00:00:58.649> of<00:00:58.770> cleaning<00:00:59.070> marks<00:00:59.460> that<00:00:59.699> the

00:00:59.930 --> 00:00:59.940 
little bit of cleaning marks that the

00:00:59.940 --> 00:01:02.840 
little bit of cleaning marks that the
solvent<00:01:00.570> left<00:01:00.899> behind<00:01:01.199> but<00:01:01.590> there<00:01:02.340> is<00:01:02.550> no

00:01:02.840 --> 00:01:02.850 
solvent left behind but there is no

00:01:02.850 --> 00:01:06.100 
solvent left behind but there is no
black<00:01:03.809> guitar<00:01:04.220> so<00:01:05.220> how<00:01:05.489> does<00:01:05.549> she<00:01:05.760> perform

00:01:06.100 --> 00:01:06.110 
black guitar so how does she perform

00:01:06.110 --> 00:01:08.330 
black guitar so how does she perform
that<00:01:07.110> what<00:01:07.439> we're<00:01:07.560> going<00:01:07.680> to<00:01:07.710> try<00:01:07.890> the<00:01:08.010> same

00:01:08.330 --> 00:01:08.340 
that what we're going to try the same

00:01:08.340 --> 00:01:10.370 
that what we're going to try the same
thing<00:01:08.400> here<00:01:09.030> we<00:01:09.180> got<00:01:09.330> a<00:01:09.360> flashlight<00:01:09.659> and<00:01:10.229> we're

00:01:10.370 --> 00:01:10.380 
thing here we got a flashlight and we're

00:01:10.380 --> 00:01:11.570 
thing here we got a flashlight and we're
gonna<00:01:10.500> put<00:01:10.619> it<00:01:10.710> behind<00:01:10.830> here<00:01:11.250> so<00:01:11.280> you<00:01:11.490> can

00:01:11.570 --> 00:01:11.580 
gonna put it behind here so you can

00:01:11.580 --> 00:01:14.149 
gonna put it behind here so you can
actually<00:01:11.670> see<00:01:12.299> the<00:01:12.510> actuation<00:01:13.080> of<00:01:13.500> the

00:01:14.149 --> 00:01:14.159 
actually see the actuation of the

00:01:14.159 --> 00:01:19.340 
actually see the actuation of the
shutter<00:01:15.110> have<00:01:16.110> it<00:01:16.229> on<00:01:16.380> manual<00:01:17.310> here<00:01:18.000> let's<00:01:18.689> get

00:01:19.340 --> 00:01:19.350 
shutter have it on manual here let's get

00:01:19.350 --> 00:01:26.810 
shutter have it on manual here let's get
a<00:01:20.250> nice<00:01:21.320> good<00:01:22.320> shutter<00:01:22.770> speed<00:01:23.159> how<00:01:24.090> about<00:01:25.820> half

00:01:26.810 --> 00:01:26.820 
a nice good shutter speed how about half

00:01:26.820 --> 00:01:32.300 
a nice good shutter speed how about half
a<00:01:27.000> second<00:01:27.390> or<00:01:27.479> so<00:01:28.009> here<00:01:29.009> is<00:01:30.320> one<00:01:31.320> fiftieth<00:01:31.920> of<00:01:32.189> a

00:01:32.300 --> 00:01:32.310 
a second or so here is one fiftieth of a

00:01:32.310 --> 00:01:44.590 
a second or so here is one fiftieth of a
second<00:01:40.430> let's<00:01:41.430> speed<00:01:41.729> it<00:01:41.759> up<00:01:41.909> a<00:01:42.030> little<00:01:42.180> bit

00:01:44.590 --> 00:01:44.600 

00:01:44.600 --> 00:01:50.310 

let's<00:01:45.600> go<00:01:45.930> to

00:01:50.310 --> 00:01:50.320 

00:01:50.320 --> 00:01:55.810 

125th<00:01:51.320> of<00:01:51.470> a<00:01:51.530> second<00:01:53.500> we<00:01:54.500> kept<00:01:55.160> the<00:01:55.310> mirror<00:01:55.640> out

00:01:55.810 --> 00:01:55.820 
125th of a second we kept the mirror out

00:01:55.820 --> 00:01:58.140 
125th of a second we kept the mirror out
of<00:01:55.970> the<00:01:56.030> way<00:01:56.180> you<00:01:56.240> see<00:01:56.810> a<00:01:56.840> little<00:01:56.960> bit<00:01:57.080> better

00:01:58.140 --> 00:01:58.150 
of the way you see a little bit better

00:01:58.150 --> 00:02:00.670 
of the way you see a little bit better
okay<00:01:59.150> you<00:01:59.180> can<00:01:59.420> see<00:01:59.600> the<00:01:59.630> the<00:02:00.170> shutter<00:02:00.380> speed

00:02:00.670 --> 00:02:00.680 
okay you can see the the shutter speed

00:02:00.680 --> 00:02:02.560 
okay you can see the the shutter speed
is<00:02:00.800> getting<00:02:00.950> faster<00:02:01.340> so<00:02:01.850> you'll<00:02:02.060> see<00:02:02.240> less<00:02:02.510> and

00:02:02.560 --> 00:02:02.570 
is getting faster so you'll see less and

00:02:02.570 --> 00:02:10.680 
is getting faster so you'll see less and
less<00:02:02.780> of<00:02:03.020> light<00:02:03.230> coming<00:02:03.560> through<00:02:04.780> one

00:02:10.680 --> 00:02:10.690 

00:02:10.690 --> 00:02:17.830 

500-1000<00:02:14.440> and<00:02:15.440> let's<00:02:15.950> go<00:02:16.130> up<00:02:16.280> to<00:02:16.550> the<00:02:17.060> maximum

00:02:17.830 --> 00:02:17.840 
500-1000 and let's go up to the maximum

00:02:17.840 --> 00:02:24.880 
500-1000 and let's go up to the maximum
one<00:02:18.500> four<00:02:18.950> thousand<00:02:19.550> a<00:02:19.790> second<00:02:23.230> okay

00:02:24.880 --> 00:02:24.890 
one four thousand a second okay

00:02:24.890 --> 00:02:27.220 
one four thousand a second okay
it's<00:02:25.310> very<00:02:25.520> very<00:02:25.940> quick<00:02:26.180> shutter<00:02:26.420> speeds<00:02:26.810> so

00:02:27.220 --> 00:02:27.230 
it's very very quick shutter speeds so

00:02:27.230 --> 00:02:30.000 
it's very very quick shutter speeds so
you<00:02:27.290> only<00:02:27.620> see<00:02:27.740> a<00:02:27.920> very<00:02:28.250> very<00:02:28.340> fleeting

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:30.010 
you only see a very very fleeting

00:02:30.010 --> 00:02:35.200 
you only see a very very fleeting
glimpse<00:02:31.010> of<00:02:31.190> the<00:02:31.370> light<00:02:31.550> but<00:02:31.850> it<00:02:31.940> works<00:02:32.120> and<00:02:34.210> I

00:02:35.200 --> 00:02:35.210 
glimpse of the light but it works and I

00:02:35.210 --> 00:02:37.540 
glimpse of the light but it works and I
don't<00:02:35.630> have<00:02:35.840> a<00:02:35.900> shutter<00:02:36.200> speed<00:02:36.470> tester<00:02:37.130> so<00:02:37.520> I

00:02:37.540 --> 00:02:37.550 
don't have a shutter speed tester so I

00:02:37.550 --> 00:02:39.370 
don't have a shutter speed tester so I
don't<00:02:37.940> know<00:02:38.060> if<00:02:38.240> these<00:02:38.450> speeds<00:02:38.720> are<00:02:38.840> accurate

00:02:39.370 --> 00:02:39.380 
don't know if these speeds are accurate

00:02:39.380 --> 00:02:42.970 
don't know if these speeds are accurate
but<00:02:39.680> I<00:02:40.520> have<00:02:41.060> run<00:02:42.050> some<00:02:42.200> film<00:02:42.470> through<00:02:42.740> here

00:02:42.970 --> 00:02:42.980 
but I have run some film through here

00:02:42.980 --> 00:02:44.530 
but I have run some film through here
and<00:02:43.160> the<00:02:43.280> exposure<00:02:43.580> looks<00:02:44.030> looks<00:02:44.330> pretty

00:02:44.530 --> 00:02:44.540 
and the exposure looks looks pretty

00:02:44.540 --> 00:02:48.130 
and the exposure looks looks pretty
accurate<00:02:44.930> so<00:02:46.000> I'd<00:02:47.000> have<00:02:47.270> to<00:02:47.450> pronounce<00:02:47.810> this

00:02:48.130 --> 00:02:48.140 
accurate so I'd have to pronounce this

00:02:48.140 --> 00:02:53.620 
accurate so I'd have to pronounce this
as<00:02:48.200> success<00:02:49.150> I<00:02:50.150> now<00:02:50.840> have<00:02:51.080> a<00:02:51.370> canon<00:02:52.370> eos<00:02:52.760> 10s

00:03:08.560 --> 00:03:08.570 
what we could of the shutter bumper

00:03:08.570 --> 00:03:11.890 
what we could of the shutter bumper
inside<00:03:08.989> there<00:03:09.320> there<00:03:09.770> might<00:03:09.980> be<00:03:10.010> still<00:03:10.900> some

inside there there might be still some

00:03:11.900 --> 00:03:13.960 
inside there there might be still some
components<00:03:12.620> of<00:03:12.800> that<00:03:12.890> shutter<00:03:13.459> which<00:03:13.790> will

00:03:13.960 --> 00:03:13.970 
components of that shutter which will

00:03:13.970 --> 00:03:16.330 
components of that shutter which will
deteriorate<00:03:14.630> over<00:03:14.959> time<00:03:15.260> and<00:03:15.860> reintroduce

deteriorate over time and reintroduce
the<00:03:16.489> problem<00:03:17.170> so<00:03:18.170> whenever<00:03:18.590> I<00:03:18.739> do<00:03:18.890> something

00:03:19.570 --> 00:03:19.580 
the problem so whenever I do something

00:03:19.580 --> 00:03:22.210 
the problem so whenever I do something
like<00:03:19.610> this<00:03:19.970> whenever<00:03:20.840> I<00:03:20.989> change<00:03:21.350> film<00:03:21.830> I

00:03:22.210 --> 00:03:22.220 
like this whenever I change film I

00:03:22.220 --> 00:03:25.570 
like this whenever I change film I
always<00:03:22.550> look<00:03:22.820> again<00:03:23.300> for<00:03:23.660> the<00:03:23.900> telltale<00:03:24.800> signs

00:03:25.570 --> 00:03:25.580 
always look again for the telltale signs

00:03:25.580 --> 00:03:31.630 
always look again for the telltale signs
or<00:03:26.500> the<00:03:29.170> just<00:03:30.170> a<00:03:30.320> black<00:03:30.560> guitar<00:03:31.010> that<00:03:31.489> will

00:03:31.630 --> 00:03:31.640 
or the just a black guitar that will

00:03:31.640 --> 00:03:35.050 
or the just a black guitar that will
show<00:03:31.910> up<00:03:32.090> on<00:03:32.330> the<00:03:32.570> shutter<00:03:33.880> which<00:03:34.880> will

00:03:35.050 --> 00:03:35.060 
show up on the shutter which will

00:03:35.060 --> 00:03:37.330 
show up on the shutter which will
indicate<00:03:35.360> that<00:03:35.780> the<00:03:36.020> will<00:03:37.010> need<00:03:37.190> to<00:03:37.250> be

00:03:37.330 --> 00:03:37.340 
indicate that the will need to be

00:03:37.340 --> 00:03:39.910 
indicate that the will need to be
cleaned<00:03:37.489> again<00:03:38.320> again<00:03:39.320> the<00:03:39.500> only<00:03:39.650> way<00:03:39.770> to

00:03:39.910 --> 00:03:39.920 
cleaned again again the only way to

00:03:39.920 --> 00:03:42.160 
cleaned again again the only way to
really<00:03:40.459> solve<00:03:40.790> this<00:03:40.970> problem<00:03:41.390> is<00:03:41.570> replace<00:03:41.959> the

00:03:42.160 --> 00:03:42.170 
really solve this problem is replace the

00:03:42.170 --> 00:03:44.530 
really solve this problem is replace the
shutter<00:03:42.410> at<00:03:42.680> significant<00:03:43.220> cost<00:03:43.269> but<00:03:44.269> since<00:03:44.450> I

00:03:44.530 --> 00:03:44.540 
shutter at significant cost but since I

00:03:44.540 --> 00:03:46.720 
shutter at significant cost but since I
did<00:03:44.690> not<00:03:44.810> want<00:03:45.019> to<00:03:45.110> do<00:03:45.230> that<00:03:45.340> I'll<00:03:46.340> clean<00:03:46.640> the

00:03:46.720 --> 00:03:46.730 
did not want to do that I'll clean the

00:03:46.730 --> 00:03:50.890 
did not want to do that I'll clean the
shutter<00:03:47.920> frequency<00:03:48.920> I<00:03:49.480> don't<00:03:50.480> really<00:03:50.690> know

00:03:50.890 --> 00:03:50.900 
shutter frequency I don't really know

00:03:50.900 --> 00:03:53.800 
shutter frequency I don't really know
because<00:03:51.200> all<00:03:52.100> the<00:03:52.400> camera<00:03:53.120> bodies<00:03:53.420> have<00:03:53.570> done

00:03:53.800 --> 00:03:53.810 
because all the camera bodies have done

00:03:53.810 --> 00:03:55.750 
because all the camera bodies have done
this<00:03:53.959> for<00:03:54.290> once<00:03:54.830> I've<00:03:55.010> cleaned<00:03:55.310> them<00:03:55.520> they

00:03:55.750 --> 00:03:55.760 
this for once I've cleaned them they

00:03:55.760 --> 00:03:56.120 
this for once I've cleaned them they
have

00:03:56.120 --> 00:03:56.130 
have

00:03:56.130 --> 00:03:59.600 
have
stayed<00:03:56.310> clean<00:03:56.730> for<00:03:58.010> going<00:03:59.010> on<00:03:59.130> two<00:03:59.460> or<00:03:59.550> three

00:03:59.600 --> 00:03:59.610 
stayed clean for going on two or three

00:03:59.610 --> 00:04:02.720 
stayed clean for going on two or three
years<00:04:00.000> now<00:04:00.090> so<00:04:01.050> if<00:04:01.470> this<00:04:01.650> problem<00:04:02.400> does

00:04:02.720 --> 00:04:02.730 
years now so if this problem does

00:04:02.730 --> 00:04:04.970 
years now so if this problem does
reintroduce<00:04:03.210> itself<00:04:03.860> its

00:04:04.970 --> 00:04:04.980 
reintroduce itself its

00:04:04.980 --> 00:04:08.570 
reintroduce itself its
v4<00:04:05.730> into<00:04:05.970> the<00:04:06.060> future<00:04:06.560> so<00:04:07.560> almost<00:04:08.190> I<00:04:08.280> have<00:04:08.460> to

00:04:08.570 --> 00:04:08.580 
v4 into the future so almost I have to

00:04:08.580 --> 00:04:12.860 
v4 into the future so almost I have to
do<00:04:08.760> get<00:04:09.660> camera<00:04:10.080> lens<00:04:11.150> this<00:04:12.150> bad<00:04:12.450> going<00:04:12.810> on

00:04:12.860 --> 00:04:12.870 
do get camera lens this bad going on

00:04:12.870 --> 00:04:18.920 
do get camera lens this bad going on
here<00:04:14.330> and<00:04:15.330> now<00:04:15.720> I<00:04:16.489> have<00:04:17.489> fully<00:04:18.480> functional

00:04:18.920 --> 00:04:18.930 
here and now I have fully functional

00:04:18.930 --> 00:04:20.690 
here and now I have fully functional
camera<00:04:19.230> thank<00:04:20.010> you<00:04:20.070> very<00:04:20.190> much<00:04:20.370> hope<00:04:20.610> you
