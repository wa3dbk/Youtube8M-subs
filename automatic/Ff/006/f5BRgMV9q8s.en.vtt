the lock security as a pattern okay when
i<00:03:17.440> unlock<00:03:18.070> the<00:03:18.310> screen<00:03:18.640> it<00:03:18.910> will<00:03:19.360> directly

00:03:19.949 --> 00:03:19.959 
i unlock the screen it will directly

00:03:19.959 --> 00:03:23.270 
i unlock the screen it will directly
take<00:03:20.410> me<00:03:20.739> to<00:03:21.010> the<00:03:21.190> android<00:03:22.030> screen<00:03:22.390> to<00:03:22.870> unlock

00:03:23.270 --> 00:03:23.280 
take me to the android screen to unlock

00:03:23.280 --> 00:03:25.590 
take me to the android screen to unlock
so<00:03:24.280> as<00:03:24.580> you<00:03:24.730> can<00:03:24.850> see<00:03:24.910> this<00:03:25.060> is<00:03:25.150> an<00:03:25.239> android

00:03:25.590 --> 00:03:25.600 
so as you can see this is an android

00:03:25.600 --> 00:03:30.830 
so as you can see this is an android
screen<00:03:25.720> with<00:03:26.019> my<00:03:26.140> -<00:03:26.320> clock<00:03:26.650> widget<00:03:26.830> over<00:03:27.040> here

00:03:30.830 --> 00:03:30.840 

00:03:30.840 --> 00:03:34.680 

so<00:03:31.840> the<00:03:32.140> lock<00:03:32.800> functionality<00:03:33.610> is<00:03:33.790> not<00:03:34.360> that

00:03:34.680 --> 00:03:34.690 
so the lock functionality is not that

00:03:34.690 --> 00:03:39.120 
so the lock functionality is not that
great<00:03:35.140> but<00:03:36.360> it<00:03:37.360> is<00:03:37.660> still<00:03:37.959> there<00:03:38.260> so<00:03:38.709> if<00:03:38.950> you

00:03:39.120 --> 00:03:39.130 
great but it is still there so if you

00:03:39.130 --> 00:03:44.550 
great but it is still there so if you
want<00:03:39.400> security<00:03:42.540> then<00:03:43.540> there<00:03:43.810> is<00:03:43.959> clear

00:03:44.550 --> 00:03:44.560 
want security then there is clear

00:03:44.560 --> 00:03:47.310 
want security then there is clear
banners<00:03:45.130> on<00:03:45.310> lock<00:03:45.549> screen<00:03:45.580> the<00:03:46.510> block<00:03:46.870> volume
