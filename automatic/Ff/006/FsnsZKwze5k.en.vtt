blending these types of materials

00:00:06.480 --> 00:00:08.540 
blending these types of materials
together<00:00:06.680> because<00:00:07.680> it<00:00:07.980> doesn't<00:00:08.250> generate<00:00:08.490> any

00:00:08.540 --> 00:00:08.550 
together because it doesn't generate any

00:00:08.550 --> 00:00:10.820 
together because it doesn't generate any
friction<00:00:09.000> or<00:00:09.269> any<00:00:09.420> heat<00:00:09.660> and<00:00:09.960> often<00:00:10.530> times

friction or any heat and often times
when<00:00:11.040> you're<00:00:11.160> blending<00:00:11.400> these<00:00:12.059> types<00:00:12.360> of

00:00:12.499 --> 00:00:12.509 
when you're blending these types of

products they involve some resins that

00:00:14.910 --> 00:00:17.630 
products they involve some resins that
are<00:00:15.000> low<00:00:15.179> melters<00:00:15.719> and<00:00:15.960> they<00:00:16.949> cannot<00:00:17.279> have

such heat and such friction introduced

00:00:20.130 --> 00:00:21.769 
such heat and such friction introduced
into<00:00:20.430> these<00:00:20.550> blends<00:00:21.060> because<00:00:21.630> they'll

00:00:21.769 --> 00:00:21.779 
into these blends because they'll

00:00:21.779 --> 00:00:24.019 
into these blends because they'll
prematurely<00:00:22.320> set<00:00:22.740> and<00:00:23.369> one<00:00:23.490> of<00:00:23.580> my<00:00:23.640> favorite

00:00:24.019 --> 00:00:24.029 
prematurely set and one of my favorite

00:00:24.029 --> 00:00:26.150 
prematurely set and one of my favorite
applications<00:00:24.720> is<00:00:24.960> in<00:00:25.230> the<00:00:25.500> highway<00:00:25.830> paint

that blend of a highway paint and when
you<00:00:47.960> are<00:00:48.960> driving<00:00:49.170> down<00:00:49.440> the<00:00:49.530> road<00:00:49.680> I<00:00:49.710> remember

00:00:50.029 --> 00:00:50.039 
you are driving down the road I remember

00:00:50.039 --> 00:00:52.729 
you are driving down the road I remember
I<00:00:50.070> was<00:00:50.280> coming<00:00:50.520> back<00:00:50.640> from<00:00:50.910> a<00:00:51.530> trip<00:00:52.530> in<00:00:52.710> Florida

00:00:52.729 --> 00:00:52.739 
I was coming back from a trip in Florida

00:00:52.739 --> 00:00:54.830 
I was coming back from a trip in Florida
and<00:00:53.160> I<00:00:53.219> was<00:00:53.340> trying<00:00:53.579> my<00:00:54.000> darndest<00:00:54.329> to<00:00:54.539> get<00:00:54.660> back

00:00:54.830 --> 00:00:54.840 
and I was trying my darndest to get back

00:00:54.840 --> 00:00:56.930 
and I was trying my darndest to get back
to<00:00:54.989> the<00:00:55.079> Orlando<00:00:55.469> Airport<00:00:55.649> and<00:00:56.460> I<00:00:56.550> was<00:00:56.670> stuck

00:00:56.930 --> 00:00:56.940 
to the Orlando Airport and I was stuck

00:00:56.940 --> 00:00:58.970 
to the Orlando Airport and I was stuck
behind<00:00:57.120> one<00:00:57.420> of<00:00:57.449> those<00:00:57.629> trucks<00:00:58.109> painting

00:00:58.970 --> 00:00:58.980 
behind one of those trucks painting

00:00:58.980 --> 00:01:00.920 
behind one of those trucks painting
yellow<00:00:59.190> lines<00:00:59.520> on<00:00:59.760> the<00:00:59.850> highway<00:01:00.239> and<00:01:00.480> I

00:01:00.920 --> 00:01:00.930 
yellow lines on the highway and I

00:01:00.930 --> 00:01:02.389 
yellow lines on the highway and I
thought<00:01:01.140> come<00:01:01.379> on<00:01:01.530> let's<00:01:01.800> go<00:01:01.980> I<00:01:02.010> got<00:01:02.250> to<00:01:02.280> get

00:01:02.389 --> 00:01:02.399 
thought come on let's go I got to get

00:01:02.399 --> 00:01:04.759 
thought come on let's go I got to get
this<00:01:02.550> airplane<00:01:02.820> and<00:01:03.329> then<00:01:03.840> I<00:01:03.870> realized<00:01:04.409> that

00:01:04.759 --> 00:01:04.769 
this airplane and then I realized that

00:01:04.769 --> 00:01:07.460 
this airplane and then I realized that
they<00:01:05.159> were<00:01:05.189> actually<00:01:05.540> adding<00:01:06.540> in<00:01:06.689> bags<00:01:07.140> of

00:01:07.460 --> 00:01:07.470 
they were actually adding in bags of

00:01:07.470 --> 00:01:08.870 
they were actually adding in bags of
material<00:01:07.950> that<00:01:08.070> was<00:01:08.189> mixed<00:01:08.490> in<00:01:08.580> the<00:01:08.640> roller

00:01:08.870 --> 00:01:08.880 
material that was mixed in the roller

00:01:08.880 --> 00:01:10.580 
material that was mixed in the roller
mixer<00:01:09.299> and<00:01:09.540> after<00:01:09.900> that<00:01:10.080> it<00:01:10.350> was<00:01:10.439> so

00:01:10.580 --> 00:01:10.590 
mixer and after that it was so

00:01:10.590 --> 00:01:12.679 
mixer and after that it was so
fascinating<00:01:10.979> to<00:01:11.340> watch<00:01:11.520> I<00:01:11.970> didn't<00:01:12.360> even<00:01:12.479> care

00:01:12.679 --> 00:01:12.689 
fascinating to watch I didn't even care

00:01:12.689 --> 00:01:14.690 
fascinating to watch I didn't even care
if<00:01:12.780> I<00:01:12.900> miss<00:01:13.080> my<00:01:13.229> plane<00:01:13.290> or<00:01:13.650> not<00:01:13.799> because<00:01:14.520> it<00:01:14.610> was

00:01:14.690 --> 00:01:14.700 
if I miss my plane or not because it was

00:01:14.700 --> 00:01:16.760 
if I miss my plane or not because it was
so<00:01:14.880> neat<00:01:15.240> to<00:01:15.509> see<00:01:15.689> this<00:01:16.080> material<00:01:16.590> on

00:01:16.760 --> 00:01:16.770 
so neat to see this material on

00:01:16.770 --> 00:01:19.490 
so neat to see this material on
application<00:01:17.549> so<00:01:18.180> with<00:01:18.750> the<00:01:18.869> roller<00:01:19.080> mixture

00:01:19.490 --> 00:01:19.500 
application so with the roller mixture

00:01:19.500 --> 00:01:20.840 
application so with the roller mixture
they'll<00:01:19.619> actually<00:01:19.770> have<00:01:19.979> dedicated<00:01:20.610> lines

00:01:20.840 --> 00:01:20.850 
they'll actually have dedicated lines

00:01:20.850 --> 00:01:22.490 
they'll actually have dedicated lines
will<00:01:21.090> I<00:01:21.119> have<00:01:21.299> one<00:01:21.540> roll<00:01:21.750> of<00:01:21.869> mixer<00:01:22.140> for<00:01:22.320> doing

00:01:22.490 --> 00:01:22.500 
will I have one roll of mixer for doing

00:01:22.500 --> 00:01:24.020 
will I have one roll of mixer for doing
the<00:01:22.590> yellow<00:01:22.920> they'll<00:01:23.430> have<00:01:23.580> one<00:01:23.790> roll<00:01:24.000> of

00:01:24.020 --> 00:01:24.030 
the yellow they'll have one roll of

00:01:24.030 --> 00:01:27.380 
the yellow they'll have one roll of
mixer<00:01:24.360> for<00:01:24.540> doing<00:01:24.840> the<00:01:25.229> white<00:01:26.090> highway<00:01:27.090> paint

00:01:27.380 --> 00:01:27.390 
mixer for doing the white highway paint

00:01:27.390 --> 00:01:29.090 
mixer for doing the white highway paint
blend<00:01:27.689> and<00:01:27.930> they'll<00:01:28.110> isolate<00:01:28.290> them<00:01:28.799> and<00:01:28.950> keep

00:01:29.090 --> 00:01:29.100 
blend and they'll isolate them and keep

00:01:29.100 --> 00:01:32.319 
blend and they'll isolate them and keep
them<00:01:29.280> separate<00:01:29.790> but<00:01:30.390> again<00:01:30.869> the<00:01:31.619> ability<00:01:32.130> to
