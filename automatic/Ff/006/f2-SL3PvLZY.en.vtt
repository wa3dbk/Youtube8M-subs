we listed this on our website only
yesterday<00:00:18.180> and<00:00:18.830> today<00:00:19.830> we<00:00:20.100> have<00:00:20.340> a<00:00:20.580> sample

00:00:20.870 --> 00:00:20.880 
yesterday and today we have a sample

00:00:20.880 --> 00:00:22.790 
yesterday and today we have a sample
that's<00:00:21.390> come<00:00:21.570> through<00:00:21.600> to<00:00:21.990> us<00:00:22.050> only<00:00:22.470> a<00:00:22.500> few

00:00:25.140 --> 00:00:27.050 
minutes ago as you can see this is a
pre-production<00:00:25.769> sample<00:00:26.580> so<00:00:26.699> it's<00:00:26.820> not<00:00:27.000> a

00:00:27.050 --> 00:00:27.060 
pre-production sample so it's not a

00:00:27.060 --> 00:00:28.519 
pre-production sample so it's not a
final<00:00:27.539> unit<00:00:27.869> but<00:00:28.019> the<00:00:28.170> time<00:00:28.380> they're

the g2 in sort of summary I suppose this

00:01:32.400 --> 00:01:37.249 
the g2 in sort of summary I suppose this
is<00:01:32.460> a<00:01:32.640> beefed-up<00:01:33.299> g2<00:01:34.850> but<00:01:35.850> designed<00:01:36.689> to<00:01:36.869> be<00:01:37.020> the

00:05:26.110 --> 00:05:26.120 
appreciate it's quite hard to get an

00:05:26.120 --> 00:05:28.570 
appreciate it's quite hard to get an
idea<00:05:26.390> of<00:05:26.450> the<00:05:26.630> true<00:05:26.870> quality<00:05:27.410> but<00:05:28.250> it's<00:05:28.400> pretty

00:05:28.570 --> 00:05:28.580 
idea of the true quality but it's pretty

00:05:28.580 --> 00:05:31.240 
idea of the true quality but it's pretty
good<00:05:28.910> on<00:05:29.360> this<00:05:29.540> doesn't<00:05:30.350> pop<00:05:30.620> out<00:05:30.800> quite<00:05:31.130> as

00:05:31.240 --> 00:05:31.250 
good on this doesn't pop out quite as

00:05:31.250 --> 00:05:37.000 
good on this doesn't pop out quite as
much<00:05:31.430> as<00:05:31.670> the<00:05:31.820> g2<00:05:34.690> it's<00:05:35.690> pretty<00:05:35.870> good<00:05:35.960> let<00:05:36.950> me

00:05:37.000 --> 00:05:37.010 
much as the g2 it's pretty good let me

00:05:37.010 --> 00:05:44.740 
much as the g2 it's pretty good let me
just<00:05:37.160> whack<00:05:37.370> the<00:05:37.550> volume<00:05:37.820> up<00:05:37.940> to<00:05:38.090> full

00:05:44.740 --> 00:05:44.750 

00:05:44.750 --> 00:05:49.300 

Oh

00:05:49.300 --> 00:05:49.310 

00:05:49.310 --> 00:05:52.970 

so<00:05:50.310> that's<00:05:50.430> actually<00:05:50.850> quite<00:05:51.750> loud<00:05:52.110> you<00:05:52.620> do<00:05:52.770> get

00:05:52.970 --> 00:05:52.980 
so that's actually quite loud you do get

00:05:52.980 --> 00:05:56.230 
so that's actually quite loud you do get
a<00:05:53.010> little<00:05:53.280> bit<00:05:53.460> of<00:05:53.580> vibration<00:05:54.390> through<00:05:55.110> the

00:05:56.230 --> 00:05:56.240 
a little bit of vibration through the

00:05:56.240 --> 00:05:58.610 
a little bit of vibration through the
back<00:05:57.240> panel<00:05:57.510> here<00:05:57.810> but<00:05:57.990> nothing<00:05:58.290> too<00:05:58.470> much

00:05:58.610 --> 00:05:58.620 
back panel here but nothing too much

00:05:58.620 --> 00:06:00.560 
back panel here but nothing too much
considering<00:05:59.130> the<00:05:59.340> the<00:05:59.610> sound<00:06:00.030> that<00:06:00.180> comes<00:06:00.300> out

00:06:00.560 --> 00:06:00.570 
considering the the sound that comes out

00:06:00.570 --> 00:06:04.640 
considering the the sound that comes out
of<00:06:01.470> that<00:06:01.530> it's<00:06:02.190> really<00:06:02.520> quite<00:06:02.900> impressive<00:06:03.900> so

00:06:04.640 --> 00:06:04.650 
of that it's really quite impressive so

00:06:04.650 --> 00:06:06.110 
of that it's really quite impressive so
you<00:06:04.740> can<00:06:04.860> play<00:06:05.040> around<00:06:05.160> with<00:06:05.490> the<00:06:05.550> actual<00:06:05.790> size

00:06:06.110 --> 00:06:06.120 
you can play around with the actual size

00:06:06.120 --> 00:06:08.810 
you can play around with the actual size
of<00:06:06.300> the<00:06:06.360> video<00:06:06.660> and<00:06:06.810> everything<00:06:06.870> here<00:06:07.820> and
