we're gonna include jelly bellies I was

00:05:13.940 --> 00:05:15.790 
we're gonna include jelly bellies I was
hoping<00:05:14.240> you<00:05:14.870> know<00:05:14.990> for<00:05:15.200> me<00:05:15.260> something<00:05:15.560> really

00:05:15.790 --> 00:05:15.800 
hoping you know for me something really

00:05:15.800 --> 00:05:18.130 
hoping you know for me something really
unique<00:05:16.040> like<00:05:16.370> a<00:05:16.490> unique<00:05:17.210> combo<00:05:17.660> pack<00:05:17.900> that

00:05:18.130 --> 00:05:18.140 
unique like a unique combo pack that

00:05:18.140 --> 00:05:24.820 
unique like a unique combo pack that
they<00:05:18.830> have<00:05:20.410> but<00:05:21.850> the<00:05:22.850> thing<00:05:23.210> that<00:05:23.600> I<00:05:23.960> guess<00:05:24.680> the

00:05:24.820 --> 00:05:24.830 
they have but the thing that I guess the

00:05:24.830 --> 00:05:27.060 
they have but the thing that I guess the
most<00:05:25.010> disappointing<00:05:25.580> is<00:05:25.820> the<00:05:26.210> overall<00:05:26.510> value

00:05:27.060 --> 00:05:27.070 
most disappointing is the overall value

00:05:27.070 --> 00:05:32.770 
most disappointing is the overall value
while<00:05:28.070> 20<00:05:28.960> 173<00:05:29.960> isn't<00:05:30.700> horrible<00:05:31.700> from<00:05:31.910> 2699

00:05:32.770 --> 00:05:32.780 
while 20 173 isn't horrible from 2699

00:05:32.780 --> 00:05:36.219 
while 20 173 isn't horrible from 2699
they<00:05:32.930> promised<00:05:33.260> a<00:05:33.350> $54<00:05:33.979> value<00:05:34.250> and<00:05:35.229> that's

00:05:36.219 --> 00:05:36.229 
they promised a $54 value and that's

00:05:36.229 --> 00:05:38.860 
they promised a $54 value and that's
just<00:05:36.470> not<00:05:36.620> here<00:05:36.979> so<00:05:37.490> I<00:05:37.790> mean<00:05:37.970> unless<00:05:38.240> I'm<00:05:38.510> I

00:05:38.860 --> 00:05:38.870 
just not here so I mean unless I'm I

00:05:38.870 --> 00:05:41.560 
just not here so I mean unless I'm I
missed<00:05:39.740> a<00:05:39.919> big<00:05:40.250> value<00:05:40.460> somewhere<00:05:41.000> unless<00:05:41.360> the

00:05:41.560 --> 00:05:41.570 
missed a big value somewhere unless the

00:05:41.570 --> 00:05:44.260 
missed a big value somewhere unless the
rock<00:05:41.720> candy<00:05:41.950> I<00:05:42.950> mean<00:05:43.460> I<00:05:43.520> have<00:05:43.640> summated<00:05:44.030> it's

00:05:44.260 --> 00:05:44.270 
rock candy I mean I have summated it's

00:05:44.270 --> 00:05:46.659 
rock candy I mean I have summated it's
55<00:05:44.690> cents<00:05:44.960> apiece<00:05:45.110> which<00:05:46.100> would<00:05:46.280> be<00:05:46.400> around

00:05:46.659 --> 00:05:46.669 
55 cents apiece which would be around

00:05:46.669 --> 00:05:49.240 
55 cents apiece which would be around
five<00:05:46.910> dollars<00:05:46.940> and<00:05:47.330> 20<00:05:47.540> cents<00:05:47.810> so<00:05:48.110> that's<00:05:49.100> the

00:05:49.240 --> 00:05:49.250 
five dollars and 20 cents so that's the

00:05:49.250 --> 00:05:52.750 
five dollars and 20 cents so that's the
only<00:05:49.430> one<00:05:49.760> I<00:05:49.790> could<00:05:50.060> really<00:05:50.270> can<00:05:51.140> see<00:05:51.760> being

00:05:52.750 --> 00:05:52.760 
only one I could really can see being

00:05:52.760 --> 00:05:56.560 
only one I could really can see being
off<00:05:53.000> so<00:05:54.250> again<00:05:55.250> I<00:05:55.520> was<00:05:55.790> disappointed<00:05:55.940> for

00:05:56.560 --> 00:05:56.570 
off so again I was disappointed for

00:05:56.570 --> 00:06:02.409 
off so again I was disappointed for
$26.99<00:05:57.110> I<00:05:57.650> expected<00:06:00.370> more<00:06:01.370> righty<00:06:01.700> like<00:06:02.180> just

00:06:02.409 --> 00:06:02.419 
$26.99 I expected more righty like just

00:06:02.419 --> 00:06:05.530 
$26.99 I expected more righty like just
more<00:06:03.140> different<00:06:03.470> candy<00:06:03.770> than<00:06:04.370> you<00:06:05.300> know<00:06:05.390> what
