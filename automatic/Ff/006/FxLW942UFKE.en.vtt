00:00:52.910 --> 00:00:52.920 
4 dollars and 59 cents for it and I

00:00:52.920 --> 00:00:54.170 
4 dollars and 59 cents for it and I
think<00:00:52.980> at<00:00:53.250> this<00:00:53.340> point<00:00:53.460> they<00:00:53.760> have<00:00:53.940> it<00:00:54.059> pretty

00:00:54.170 --> 00:00:54.180 
think at this point they have it pretty

00:00:54.180 --> 00:00:55.840 
think at this point they have it pretty
much<00:00:54.270> everywhere<00:00:54.750> I've<00:00:55.110> seen<00:00:55.350> it<00:00:55.469> at<00:00:55.559> Walmart

00:00:55.840 --> 00:00:55.850 
much everywhere I've seen it at Walmart

00:00:55.850 --> 00:00:58.369 
much everywhere I've seen it at Walmart
the<00:00:56.850> main<00:00:57.030> drugstores<00:00:57.600> like<00:00:57.899> rite<00:00:58.199> aid

00:00:58.369 --> 00:00:58.379 
the main drugstores like rite aid

00:00:58.379 --> 00:01:00.830 
the main drugstores like rite aid
Walgreens<00:00:58.949> CVS<00:00:59.280> I<00:00:59.910> think<00:01:00.390> at<00:01:00.449> those<00:01:00.600> main

00:01:00.830 --> 00:01:00.840 
Walgreens CVS I think at those main

00:01:00.840 --> 00:01:02.240 
Walgreens CVS I think at those main
drugstores<00:01:01.379> though<00:01:01.559> they<00:01:01.739> tend<00:01:01.920> to<00:01:02.039> be<00:01:02.160> a<00:01:02.190> bit

00:01:02.240 --> 00:01:02.250 
drugstores though they tend to be a bit

00:01:02.250 --> 00:01:04.100 
drugstores though they tend to be a bit
more<00:01:02.579> expensive<00:01:02.820> because<00:01:03.390> they<00:01:03.690> aren't<00:01:03.840> like

00:01:04.100 --> 00:01:04.110 
more expensive because they aren't like

00:01:04.110 --> 00:01:05.929 
more expensive because they aren't like
drugstores<00:01:04.710> it<00:01:05.010> seems<00:01:05.250> like<00:01:05.400> they<00:01:05.519> jack<00:01:05.760> up

00:01:05.929 --> 00:01:05.939 
drugstores it seems like they jack up

00:01:05.939 --> 00:01:07.820 
drugstores it seems like they jack up
their<00:01:06.060> prices<00:01:06.479> a<00:01:06.510> little<00:01:06.810> bit<00:01:06.960> to<00:01:07.500> the<00:01:07.590> point

00:01:07.820 --> 00:01:07.830 
their prices a little bit to the point

00:01:07.830 --> 00:01:09.590 
their prices a little bit to the point
where<00:01:07.979> it<00:01:08.130> could<00:01:08.280> be<00:01:08.400> like<00:01:08.610> 2<00:01:08.909> or<00:01:08.939> 3<00:01:09.090> dollars

00:01:09.590 --> 00:01:09.600 
where it could be like 2 or 3 dollars

00:01:09.600 --> 00:01:12.230 
where it could be like 2 or 3 dollars
difference<00:01:09.810> just<00:01:10.740> in<00:01:10.979> a<00:01:11.130> face<00:01:11.310> scrub<00:01:11.640> so<00:01:12.210> I

00:01:12.230 --> 00:01:12.240 
difference just in a face scrub so I

00:01:12.240 --> 00:01:13.910 
difference just in a face scrub so I
always<00:01:12.600> tend<00:01:12.780> to<00:01:12.840> stick<00:01:13.110> with<00:01:13.140> Target<00:01:13.830> in

00:01:13.910 --> 00:01:13.920 
always tend to stick with Target in

00:01:13.920 --> 00:01:15.800 
always tend to stick with Target in
Walmart<00:01:14.369> because<00:01:14.520> they<00:01:14.850> have<00:01:15.060> that<00:01:15.390> everyday

00:01:15.800 --> 00:01:15.810 
Walmart because they have that everyday

00:01:15.810 --> 00:01:17.660 
Walmart because they have that everyday
low<00:01:16.020> price<00:01:16.290> thing<00:01:16.590> going<00:01:16.890> on<00:01:17.040> for<00:01:17.400> stuff<00:01:17.580> like

00:01:17.660 --> 00:01:17.670 
low price thing going on for stuff like

00:01:17.670 --> 00:01:19.820 
low price thing going on for stuff like
this<00:01:17.939> you<00:01:18.000> just<00:01:18.360> really<00:01:18.630> can't<00:01:18.780> beat<00:01:19.049> it<00:01:19.080> so<00:01:19.799> I

00:01:19.820 --> 00:01:19.830 
this you just really can't beat it so I

00:01:19.830 --> 00:01:22.700 
this you just really can't beat it so I
always<00:01:20.159> go<00:01:20.400> to<00:01:20.430> Target<00:01:20.939> and<00:01:21.090> I<00:01:21.659> love<00:01:22.049> it<00:01:22.229> 4

00:01:22.700 --> 00:01:22.710 
always go to Target and I love it 4

00:01:22.710 --> 00:01:24.350 
always go to Target and I love it 4
dollars<00:01:22.799> and<00:01:23.070> 59<00:01:23.340> cents<00:01:23.759> for<00:01:24.000> this<00:01:24.119> I<00:01:24.330> feel

00:01:24.350 --> 00:01:24.360 
dollars and 59 cents for this I feel

00:01:24.360 --> 00:01:25.820 
dollars and 59 cents for this I feel
like<00:01:24.570> it's<00:01:24.810> a<00:01:24.869> really<00:01:25.020> good<00:01:25.320> price

00:01:25.820 --> 00:01:25.830 
like it's a really good price

00:01:25.830 --> 00:01:27.679 
like it's a really good price
because<00:01:26.040> usually<00:01:26.250> face<00:01:26.670> washes<00:01:27.180> and<00:01:27.360> scrubs

00:01:27.679 --> 00:01:27.689 
because usually face washes and scrubs

00:01:27.689 --> 00:01:29.630 
because usually face washes and scrubs
tend<00:01:28.049> to<00:01:28.140> range<00:01:28.320> from<00:01:28.439> like<00:01:28.680> 5<00:01:28.920> to<00:01:29.130> 7<00:01:29.460> dollars

00:01:29.630 --> 00:01:29.640 
tend to range from like 5 to 7 dollars

00:01:29.640 --> 00:01:31.819 
tend to range from like 5 to 7 dollars
some<00:01:30.540> are<00:01:30.659> obviously<00:01:31.020> a<00:01:31.140> lot<00:01:31.290> more<00:01:31.530> expensive

00:01:31.819 --> 00:01:31.829 
some are obviously a lot more expensive

00:01:31.829 --> 00:01:34.340 
some are obviously a lot more expensive
and<00:01:32.250> some<00:01:32.460> are<00:01:32.759> a<00:01:32.790> lot<00:01:33.030> cheaper<00:01:33.299> than<00:01:33.479> that<00:01:33.750> but

00:01:34.340 --> 00:01:34.350 
and some are a lot cheaper than that but

00:01:34.350 --> 00:01:35.630 
and some are a lot cheaper than that but
I<00:01:34.380> thought<00:01:34.590> that<00:01:34.799> for<00:01:34.920> the<00:01:35.009> quality<00:01:35.400> of<00:01:35.430> this

00:01:35.630 --> 00:01:35.640 
I thought that for the quality of this

00:01:35.640 --> 00:01:37.969 
I thought that for the quality of this
it<00:01:35.939> was<00:01:36.030> really<00:01:36.060> reasonably<00:01:36.780> priced<00:01:37.079> so<00:01:37.770> one

00:01:37.969 --> 00:01:37.979 
it was really reasonably priced so one

00:01:37.979 --> 00:01:39.260 
it was really reasonably priced so one
of<00:01:38.070> the<00:01:38.130> things<00:01:38.340> that<00:01:38.520> this<00:01:38.670> space<00:01:38.880> Grove<00:01:39.150> is

00:01:39.260 --> 00:01:39.270 
of the things that this space Grove is

00:01:39.270 --> 00:01:41.569 
of the things that this space Grove is
supposed<00:01:39.600> to<00:01:39.750> do<00:01:39.930> is<00:01:40.290> to<00:01:40.619> even<00:01:40.979> your<00:01:41.130> skin<00:01:41.369> tone

00:01:41.569 --> 00:01:41.579 
supposed to do is to even your skin tone

00:01:41.579 --> 00:01:43.670 
supposed to do is to even your skin tone
and<00:01:41.880> brighten<00:01:42.240> it<00:01:42.270> up<00:01:42.390> a<00:01:42.509> little<00:01:42.720> bit<00:01:42.869> and<00:01:43.140> I

00:01:43.670 --> 00:01:43.680 
and brighten it up a little bit and I

00:01:43.680 --> 00:01:44.960 
and brighten it up a little bit and I
definitely<00:01:44.189> think<00:01:44.399> that<00:01:44.520> it<00:01:44.729> does<00:01:44.939> that

00:01:44.960 --> 00:01:44.970 
definitely think that it does that

00:01:44.970 --> 00:01:47.719 
definitely think that it does that
really<00:01:45.600> well<00:01:45.960> I<00:01:46.259> always<00:01:46.920> use<00:01:47.130> this<00:01:47.340> in<00:01:47.610> the

00:01:47.719 --> 00:01:47.729 
really well I always use this in the

00:01:47.729 --> 00:01:49.850 
really well I always use this in the
morning<00:01:48.119> right<00:01:48.270> before<00:01:48.329> I<00:01:48.990> put<00:01:49.259> my<00:01:49.290> makeup<00:01:49.560> on

00:01:49.850 --> 00:01:49.860 
morning right before I put my makeup on

00:01:49.860 --> 00:01:51.889 
morning right before I put my makeup on
and<00:01:50.280> I<00:01:50.610> noticed<00:01:51.000> that<00:01:51.149> my<00:01:51.240> face<00:01:51.450> just<00:01:51.479> feels

00:01:51.889 --> 00:01:51.899 
and I noticed that my face just feels

00:01:51.899 --> 00:01:53.929 
and I noticed that my face just feels
really<00:01:52.200> clean<00:01:52.680> and<00:01:52.979> it<00:01:53.159> looks<00:01:53.460> a<00:01:53.700> lot<00:01:53.880> more

00:01:53.929 --> 00:01:53.939 
really clean and it looks a lot more

00:01:53.939 --> 00:01:56.450 
really clean and it looks a lot more
even<00:01:54.540> sometimes<00:01:55.470> when<00:01:55.680> I<00:01:55.740> wash<00:01:56.009> my<00:01:56.219> face<00:01:56.250> in

00:01:56.450 --> 00:01:56.460 
even sometimes when I wash my face in

00:01:56.460 --> 00:01:58.520 
even sometimes when I wash my face in
the<00:01:56.700> morning<00:01:57.090> or<00:01:57.329> even<00:01:57.479> at<00:01:57.659> night<00:01:57.840> I<00:01:58.110> notice

00:01:58.520 --> 00:01:58.530 
the morning or even at night I notice

00:01:58.530 --> 00:02:01.010 
the morning or even at night I notice
that<00:01:58.860> when<00:01:59.040> my<00:01:59.159> face<00:01:59.399> is<00:01:59.579> just<00:01:59.729> bare<00:02:00.060> my<00:02:00.750> skin

00:02:01.010 --> 00:02:01.020 
that when my face is just bare my skin

00:02:01.020 --> 00:02:02.749 
that when my face is just bare my skin
tone<00:02:01.110> really<00:02:01.409> is<00:02:01.710> not<00:02:01.979> even<00:02:02.369> I<00:02:02.460> have<00:02:02.640> like

00:02:02.749 --> 00:02:02.759 
tone really is not even I have like

00:02:02.759 --> 00:02:04.730 
tone really is not even I have like
little<00:02:02.969> red<00:02:03.240> patches<00:02:03.509> somewhere<00:02:04.170> and<00:02:04.500> it's

00:02:04.730 --> 00:02:04.740 
little red patches somewhere and it's

00:02:04.740 --> 00:02:06.440 
little red patches somewhere and it's
not<00:02:04.950> pretty<00:02:05.189> it<00:02:05.729> was<00:02:05.790> something<00:02:06.090> that<00:02:06.119> I<00:02:06.270> was<00:02:06.420> a

00:02:06.440 --> 00:02:06.450 
not pretty it was something that I was a

00:02:06.450 --> 00:02:08.029 
not pretty it was something that I was a
little<00:02:06.689> bit<00:02:06.780> self-conscious<00:02:07.259> about<00:02:07.530> before

00:02:08.029 --> 00:02:08.039 
little bit self-conscious about before

00:02:08.039 --> 00:02:09.740 
little bit self-conscious about before
but<00:02:08.310> ever<00:02:08.520> since<00:02:08.729> I've<00:02:08.910> been<00:02:09.060> using<00:02:09.270> this<00:02:09.479> face

00:02:09.740 --> 00:02:09.750 
but ever since I've been using this face

00:02:09.750 --> 00:02:11.550 
but ever since I've been using this face
scrub<00:02:10.110> I<00:02:10.349> feel<00:02:10.739> like<00:02:10.860> my<00:02:11.009> skin<00:02:11.069> tone

00:02:11.550 --> 00:02:11.560 
scrub I feel like my skin tone

00:02:11.560 --> 00:02:13.800 
scrub I feel like my skin tone
is<00:02:11.680> so<00:02:12.280> much<00:02:12.489> more<00:02:12.730> even<00:02:12.970> to<00:02:13.300> the<00:02:13.390> point<00:02:13.630> where

00:02:13.800 --> 00:02:13.810 
is so much more even to the point where

00:02:13.810 --> 00:02:15.540 
is so much more even to the point where
I<00:02:13.840> don't<00:02:14.020> have<00:02:14.319> those<00:02:14.770> little<00:02:15.040> red<00:02:15.220> patches

00:02:15.540 --> 00:02:15.550 
I don't have those little red patches

00:02:15.550 --> 00:02:18.180 
I don't have those little red patches
anymore<00:02:16.209> so<00:02:16.780> I<00:02:16.810> like<00:02:17.050> that<00:02:17.290> another<00:02:17.950> thing

00:02:18.180 --> 00:02:18.190 
anymore so I like that another thing

00:02:36.330 --> 00:02:36.340 
sometimes acne scarring can take like

00:02:36.340 --> 00:02:38.580 
sometimes acne scarring can take like
six<00:02:36.760> months<00:02:37.180> just<00:02:37.330> to<00:02:37.750> go<00:02:37.930> away<00:02:38.050> so<00:02:38.260> you're

00:02:38.580 --> 00:02:38.590 
six months just to go away so you're

00:02:38.590 --> 00:02:39.839 
six months just to go away so you're

getting this little breakout it's
leaving<00:02:40.239> this<00:02:40.330> little<00:02:40.660> acne<00:02:40.989> scar<00:02:41.260> and<00:02:41.500> it's

00:02:41.580 --> 00:02:41.590 
leaving this little acne scar and it's

00:02:41.590 --> 00:02:43.890 
leaving this little acne scar and it's
taking<00:02:41.950> six<00:02:42.400> months<00:02:42.730> to<00:02:42.849> go<00:02:43.000> away<00:02:43.120> it's<00:02:43.480> crazy

00:02:43.890 --> 00:02:43.900 
taking six months to go away it's crazy

00:02:43.900 --> 00:02:45.900 
taking six months to go away it's crazy
so<00:02:44.380> my<00:02:44.650> acne<00:02:44.950> scarring<00:02:45.220> has<00:02:45.370> always<00:02:45.580> been

00:02:45.900 --> 00:02:45.910 
so my acne scarring has always been

00:02:45.910 --> 00:02:46.890 
so my acne scarring has always been
something<00:02:46.420> that<00:02:46.569> I've<00:02:46.750> been<00:02:46.840> really

00:02:46.890 --> 00:02:46.900 
something that I've been really

00:02:46.900 --> 00:02:48.870 
something that I've been really
self-conscious<00:02:47.680> about<00:02:47.799> it's<00:02:48.130> the<00:02:48.280> reason<00:02:48.640> why

00:02:48.870 --> 00:02:48.880 
self-conscious about it's the reason why

00:02:48.880 --> 00:02:51.479 
self-conscious about it's the reason why
I<00:02:49.269> don't<00:02:49.600> go<00:02:49.870> out<00:02:49.989> into<00:02:50.230> public<00:02:50.489> without

00:02:51.479 --> 00:02:51.489 
I don't go out into public without

00:02:51.489 --> 00:02:53.370 
I don't go out into public without
makeup<00:02:51.730> on<00:02:51.940> sometimes<00:02:52.450> ever<00:02:52.959> since<00:02:53.230> I've<00:02:53.350> been

00:02:53.370 --> 00:02:53.380 
makeup on sometimes ever since I've been

00:02:53.380 --> 00:02:55.170

using<00:02:53.500> this<00:02:53.830> face<00:02:54.040> scrub<00:02:54.370> it's<00:02:54.670> been<00:02:54.819> helping

00:02:55.170 --> 00:02:55.180 
using this face scrub it's been helping

00:02:55.180 --> 00:02:57.150 
using this face scrub it's been helping
out<00:02:55.299> with<00:02:55.390> my<00:02:55.540> acne<00:02:55.930> scarring<00:02:56.230> so<00:02:56.349> much<00:02:56.799> to<00:02:57.069> the

00:02:57.150 --> 00:02:57.160 
out with my acne scarring so much to the

00:02:57.160 --> 00:02:59.490 
out with my acne scarring so much to the
point<00:02:57.370> where<00:02:57.549> I<00:02:57.580> feel<00:02:57.819> like<00:02:57.970> my<00:02:58.120> skin<00:02:58.450> is<00:02:58.660> a<00:02:58.750> lot

00:02:59.490 --> 00:02:59.500 
point where I feel like my skin is a lot

00:02:59.500 --> 00:03:01.979 
point where I feel like my skin is a lot
clearer<00:02:59.950> and<00:03:00.370> it's<00:03:01.000> maybe<00:03:01.269> the<00:03:01.390> clearest<00:03:01.840> has

00:03:01.979 --> 00:03:01.989

exfoliation factor on the back of their
bottles<00:03:33.819> and<00:03:34.120> it<00:03:34.299> basically<00:03:34.420> tells<00:03:35.019> you<00:03:35.350> how

00:03:36.150 --> 00:03:36.160 
bottles and it basically tells you how

bottles and it basically tells you how
exfoliating<00:03:37.030> the<00:03:37.150> scrub<00:03:37.450> is<00:03:37.660> so<00:03:38.170> I<00:03:38.200> noticed

00:03:38.640 --> 00:03:38.650 
exfoliating the scrub is so I noticed

00:03:38.650 --> 00:03:40.680 
exfoliating the scrub is so I noticed
that<00:03:38.829> with<00:03:39.010> the<00:03:39.220> apricot<00:03:39.549> scrub<00:03:39.910> it<00:03:40.299> is<00:03:40.420> a<00:03:40.450> deep

00:03:40.680 --> 00:03:40.690 
that with the apricot scrub it is a deep

00:03:40.690 --> 00:03:42.629 
that with the apricot scrub it is a deep
exfoliation<00:03:40.989> factor<00:03:41.980> but<00:03:42.190> with<00:03:42.310> this<00:03:42.430> one

00:03:42.629 --> 00:03:42.639 
exfoliation factor but with this one

00:03:42.639 --> 00:03:44.970 
exfoliation factor but with this one
it's<00:03:42.910> just<00:03:43.000> moderate<00:03:43.660> and<00:03:43.840> I<00:03:44.500> think<00:03:44.769> that<00:03:44.859> if

00:03:44.970 --> 00:03:44.980 
it's just moderate and I think that if

00:03:44.980 --> 00:03:46.920 
it's just moderate and I think that if
you<00:03:45.069> wanted<00:03:45.370> to<00:03:45.519> use<00:03:45.700> this<00:03:45.940> as<00:03:46.269> an<00:03:46.450> everyday

00:03:46.920 --> 00:03:46.930 
you wanted to use this as an everyday

00:03:46.930 --> 00:03:49.050 
you wanted to use this as an everyday
face<00:03:47.470> scrub<00:03:47.829> you<00:03:48.040> could<00:03:48.190> definitely<00:03:48.340> do<00:03:48.880> that

00:03:49.050 --> 00:03:49.060 
face scrub you could definitely do that

00:03:49.060 --> 00:03:50.940 
face scrub you could definitely do that
I've<00:03:49.510> been<00:03:49.870> using<00:03:50.049> it<00:03:50.260> every<00:03:50.500> single<00:03:50.799> morning

00:03:50.940 --> 00:03:50.950 
I've been using it every single morning

00:03:50.950 --> 00:03:53.009 
I've been using it every single morning

00:03:53.009 --> 00:03:53.019 
and I have really sensitive skin but it

00:03:53.019 --> 00:03:55.080 
and I have really sensitive skin but it
hasn't<00:03:53.230> dried<00:03:53.500> it<00:03:53.769> out<00:03:53.920> and<00:03:54.190> a<00:03:54.340> lot<00:03:54.579> of<00:03:54.609> face

00:03:55.090 --> 00:03:56.940

00:03:56.950 --> 00:03:59.099

about<00:03:57.489> incorporating<00:03:57.910> it<00:03:58.420> into<00:03:58.840> your

00:03:59.099 --> 00:03:59.109

00:04:05.009 --> 00:04:05.019 
could do it every day and it would be

00:04:05.019 --> 00:04:07.170

00:04:23.190 --> 00:04:23.200 
when they do so for me I personally

00:04:23.200 --> 00:04:25.380

perfect combination I love it so much
but<00:04:30.010> I<00:04:30.070> will<00:04:30.340> admit<00:04:30.670> that<00:04:30.700> it<00:04:31.000> does<00:04:31.180> have<00:04:31.390> a

but I will admit that it does have a

00:04:31.420 --> 00:04:33.900 
but I will admit that it does have a
very<00:04:31.630> strong<00:04:31.810> scent<00:04:32.620> to<00:04:32.800> it<00:04:32.830> and<00:04:33.220> for<00:04:33.760> those<00:04:33.850> of

00:04:44.580 --> 00:04:44.590 
in the morning it helps to wake me up a

00:04:44.590 --> 00:04:46.260 
in the morning it helps to wake me up a
little<00:04:44.770> bit<00:04:44.980> and<00:04:45.250> I<00:04:45.610> need<00:04:45.820> something<00:04:46.240> like

00:04:46.260 --> 00:04:46.270 
little bit and I need something like

00:04:46.270 --> 00:04:48.030 
little bit and I need something like
that<00:04:46.660> because<00:04:46.810> I'm<00:04:47.050> always<00:04:47.140> super<00:04:47.740> super

00:04:48.030 --> 00:04:48.040 
that because I'm always super super

00:04:48.040 --> 00:04:50.250 
that because I'm always super super
tired<00:04:48.280> and<00:04:48.700> I<00:04:49.060> just<00:04:49.270> need<00:04:49.690> something<00:04:50.110> that

00:04:50.250 --> 00:04:50.260 
tired and I just need something that

00:04:50.260 --> 00:04:51.540 
tired and I just need something that
kind<00:04:50.440> of<00:04:50.530> helps<00:04:50.740> me<00:04:50.800> to<00:04:51.010> start<00:04:51.220> off<00:04:51.340> my<00:04:51.370> day

00:04:51.540 --> 00:04:51.550 
kind of helps me to start off my day

00:04:51.550 --> 00:04:54.270 
kind of helps me to start off my day
right<00:04:51.910> and<00:04:52.180> this<00:04:52.330> does<00:04:52.510> that<00:04:52.780> but<00:04:53.500> because<00:04:53.950> the

00:04:54.270 --> 00:04:54.280 
right and this does that but because the

00:04:54.280 --> 00:04:56.220 
right and this does that but because the
scent<00:04:54.520> is<00:04:54.670> so<00:04:54.880> harsh<00:04:55.150> I<00:04:55.420> think<00:04:55.660> the<00:04:55.780> best<00:04:55.960> way

00:04:56.220 --> 00:04:56.230 
scent is so harsh I think the best way

00:04:56.230 --> 00:04:57.720 
scent is so harsh I think the best way
to<00:04:56.260> figure<00:04:56.530> out<00:04:56.650> if<00:04:56.800> you're<00:04:57.130> gonna<00:04:57.190> like<00:04:57.490> it<00:04:57.520> or

00:04:57.720 --> 00:04:57.730 
to figure out if you're gonna like it or

00:04:57.730 --> 00:04:59.070 
to figure out if you're gonna like it or
not<00:04:57.850> it's<00:04:58.120> just<00:04:58.270> to<00:04:58.390> go<00:04:58.540> to<00:04:58.570> the<00:04:58.750> store<00:04:59.050> and

00:04:59.070 --> 00:04:59.080 
not it's just to go to the store and

00:04:59.080 --> 00:05:01.290 
not it's just to go to the store and
smell<00:04:59.560> it<00:04:59.680> for<00:04:59.800> yourself<00:05:00.160> the<00:05:00.730> same<00:05:00.970> way<00:05:01.150> that

00:05:01.290 --> 00:05:01.300 
smell it for yourself the same way that

00:05:01.300 --> 00:05:02.970 
smell it for yourself the same way that
smells<00:05:01.660> in<00:05:01.810> the<00:05:01.870> bottle<00:05:02.170> is<00:05:02.380> the<00:05:02.500> exact<00:05:02.800> same

00:05:02.970 --> 00:05:02.980 
smells in the bottle is the exact same

00:05:02.980 --> 00:05:05.100 
smells in the bottle is the exact same
way<00:05:03.130> smells<00:05:03.610> going<00:05:03.880> onto<00:05:04.120> your<00:05:04.240> face<00:05:04.480> so<00:05:05.080> I

00:05:05.100 --> 00:05:05.110 
way smells going onto your face so I

00:05:05.110 --> 00:05:06.480 
way smells going onto your face so I
think<00:05:05.230> that's<00:05:05.590> going<00:05:05.710> to<00:05:05.770> be<00:05:05.860> the<00:05:06.010> best<00:05:06.190> way<00:05:06.460> to

00:05:06.480 --> 00:05:06.490 
think that's going to be the best way to

00:05:06.490 --> 00:05:07.890 
think that's going to be the best way to
determine<00:05:06.910> whether<00:05:07.330> you're<00:05:07.540> going<00:05:07.630> to<00:05:07.750> like

00:05:07.890 --> 00:05:07.900 
determine whether you're going to like

00:05:07.900 --> 00:05:10.230 
determine whether you're going to like
it<00:05:08.050> or<00:05:08.140> not<00:05:08.260> so<00:05:09.160> guys<00:05:09.370> that's<00:05:09.640> gonna<00:05:09.790> be<00:05:10.000> it<00:05:10.090> for

00:05:10.230 --> 00:05:10.240
