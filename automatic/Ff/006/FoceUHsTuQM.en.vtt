00:01:33.289 --> 00:01:33.299 
off of cup coffee is to just do it do it

00:01:33.299 --> 00:01:34.910 
off of cup coffee is to just do it do it
on<00:01:33.479> a<00:01:33.509> Thursday<00:01:33.900> or<00:01:33.990> Friday<00:01:34.020> so<00:01:34.409> that<00:01:34.680> you<00:01:34.770> have

00:01:41.090 --> 00:01:41.100 
don't even think I showered and kind of

00:01:41.100 --> 00:01:42.830 
don't even think I showered and kind of
curled<00:01:41.310> up<00:01:41.490> with<00:01:41.729> the<00:01:41.970> shades<00:01:42.210> closed<00:01:42.600> and

00:01:42.830 --> 00:01:42.840 
curled up with the shades closed and
