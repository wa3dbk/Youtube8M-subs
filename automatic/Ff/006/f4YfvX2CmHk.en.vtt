00:01:29.909 --> 00:01:31.819 
training enough you're not doing enough
you're<00:01:30.329> not<00:01:30.450> motivated<00:01:30.719> to<00:01:31.170> stay<00:01:31.499> on<00:01:31.709> the

00:01:31.819 --> 00:01:31.829 
you're not motivated to stay on the

00:01:31.829 --> 00:01:33.620 
you're not motivated to stay on the
program<00:01:32.279> and<00:01:32.459> stick<00:01:32.789> with<00:01:32.999> it<00:01:33.060> and<00:01:33.270> really

00:01:33.620 --> 00:01:33.630 
program and stick with it and really

00:01:33.630 --> 00:01:35.209 
program and stick with it and really
work<00:01:33.869> the<00:01:34.079> program<00:01:34.289> so<00:01:35.039> there<00:01:35.159> is

00:01:35.209 --> 00:01:35.219 
work the program so there is

00:01:35.219 --> 00:01:37.419 
work the program so there is
motivational<00:01:35.819> reason<00:01:36.149> the<00:01:36.450> second<00:01:36.840> one<00:01:36.990> is

00:01:37.419 --> 00:01:37.429 
motivational reason the second one is

00:01:37.429 --> 00:01:39.559 
motivational reason the second one is
informational<00:01:38.429> you're<00:01:38.969> training<00:01:39.450> with<00:01:39.479> a

00:01:39.559 --> 00:01:39.569 
informational you're training with a

00:01:39.569 --> 00:01:41.929 
informational you're training with a
program<00:01:39.779> but<00:01:40.439> it's<00:01:40.560> the<00:01:40.709> wrong<00:01:40.829> program<00:01:41.189> it's

00:01:41.929 --> 00:01:41.939 
program but it's the wrong program it's

00:01:41.939 --> 00:01:43.819 
program but it's the wrong program it's
better<00:01:42.299> geared<00:01:42.689> toward<00:01:43.049> people<00:01:43.200> who<00:01:43.380> have<00:01:43.799> a

better geared toward people who have a
different<00:01:44.579> biological<00:01:45.029> system<00:01:45.779> than<00:01:45.929> you<00:01:46.049> do

00:01:46.190 --> 00:01:46.200 
different biological system than you do

00:01:46.200 --> 00:01:47.690 
different biological system than you do
they<00:01:46.409> have<00:01:46.529> different<00:01:46.799> hormone<00:01:47.249> system<00:01:47.459> than

they have different hormone system than
you<00:01:47.759> do<00:01:47.849> it's<00:01:48.389> geared<00:01:48.779> better<00:01:49.020> for<00:01:49.259> them<00:01:49.439> and

00:01:49.730 --> 00:01:49.740 
you do it's geared better for them and

00:01:49.740 --> 00:01:52.669 
you do it's geared better for them and
not<00:01:50.249> as<00:01:50.459> much<00:01:50.579> for<00:01:50.880> you<00:01:50.909> and<00:01:51.319> the<00:01:52.319> third<00:01:52.529> reason

00:01:52.669 --> 00:01:52.679 
not as much for you and the third reason

00:01:52.679 --> 00:01:55.190 
not as much for you and the third reason
is<00:01:52.979> biological<00:01:53.880> is<00:01:54.389> that<00:01:54.630> the<00:01:54.779> reason<00:01:54.929> why

00:01:55.190 --> 00:01:55.200 
is biological is that the reason why

00:01:55.200 --> 00:01:56.449 
is biological is that the reason why
you're<00:01:55.380> not<00:01:55.439> making<00:01:55.679> progress<00:01:55.859> is<00:01:56.159> simply

00:01:56.449 --> 00:01:56.459 
you're not making progress is simply

00:01:56.459 --> 00:01:58.129 
you're not making progress is simply

those<00:02:09.119> are<00:02:09.239> biological<00:02:10.080> reasons<00:02:10.470> why<00:02:10.830> you're

00:03:06.250 --> 00:03:09.570 
that had the hardest the most the most
challenged<00:03:06.820> biological<00:03:07.720> system<00:03:08.140> and<00:03:08.320> so<00:03:08.980> what

00:03:09.570 --> 00:03:09.580 
challenged biological system and so what

00:03:09.580 --> 00:03:10.410 
challenged biological system and so what
we're<00:03:09.700> going<00:03:09.790> to<00:03:09.880> do<00:03:09.970> is<00:03:10.030> we're<00:03:10.120> going<00:03:10.210> to<00:03:10.300> go

00:03:10.410 --> 00:03:10.420 
we're going to do is we're going to go

00:03:10.420 --> 00:03:13.650 
we're going to do is we're going to go
in<00:03:10.540> and<00:03:10.630> destroy<00:03:11.260> those<00:03:12.070> obstacles<00:03:12.580> and<00:03:13.060> when

00:03:13.650 --> 00:03:13.660 
in and destroy those obstacles and when

00:03:13.660 --> 00:03:15.720 
in and destroy those obstacles and when
we<00:03:13.780> found<00:03:14.080> was<00:03:14.320> that<00:03:14.350> it<00:03:14.740> those<00:03:15.130> people<00:03:15.460> had

00:03:15.720 --> 00:03:15.730 
we found was that it those people had

00:03:15.730 --> 00:03:17.580 
we found was that it those people had
the<00:03:16.030> best<00:03:16.330> response<00:03:16.930> to<00:03:17.230> this<00:03:17.350> type<00:03:17.560> of

00:03:17.580 --> 00:03:17.590 
the best response to this type of

00:03:17.590 --> 00:03:19.650 
the best response to this type of
training<00:03:17.860> now<00:03:17.980> the<00:03:18.040> people<00:03:18.370> that<00:03:18.580> were<00:03:18.760> closer

00:03:19.650 --> 00:03:19.660 
training now the people that were closer

00:03:19.660 --> 00:03:21.840 
training now the people that were closer
on<00:03:19.900> the<00:03:20.020> mesomorph<00:03:20.500> side<00:03:20.800> that<00:03:21.100> that<00:03:21.400> didn't

00:03:21.840 --> 00:03:21.850 
on the mesomorph side that that didn't

00:03:21.850 --> 00:03:23.400 
on the mesomorph side that that didn't
have<00:03:22.060> like<00:03:22.270> there<00:03:22.480> weren't<00:03:22.630> really<00:03:22.930> really

00:03:23.400 --> 00:03:23.410 
have like there weren't really really

00:03:23.410 --> 00:03:25.290 
have like there weren't really really
scrawny<00:03:23.709> still<00:03:24.550> did<00:03:24.700> good<00:03:24.730> with<00:03:25.000> the<00:03:25.090> program

00:03:25.290 --> 00:03:25.300 
scrawny still did good with the program

00:03:25.300 --> 00:03:27.180 
scrawny still did good with the program
but<00:03:26.200> the<00:03:26.350> people<00:03:26.650> who<00:03:26.680> are<00:03:26.800> the<00:03:26.920> most

00:03:27.180 --> 00:03:27.190 
but the people who are the most

00:03:27.190 --> 00:03:28.920 
but the people who are the most
challenged<00:03:27.850> were<00:03:28.090> the<00:03:28.209> ones<00:03:28.420> that<00:03:28.540> did<00:03:28.810> the

00:03:28.920 --> 00:03:28.930 
challenged were the ones that did the

00:03:28.930 --> 00:03:30.360 
challenged were the ones that did the
best<00:03:29.290> with<00:03:29.530> the<00:03:29.620> program<00:03:29.770> the<00:03:30.040> best

00:03:30.360 --> 00:03:30.370 
best with the program the best

00:03:30.370 --> 00:03:32.430 
best with the program the best
transformation<00:03:31.090> so<00:03:31.570> I<00:03:31.810> don't<00:03:32.140> care<00:03:32.230> how

00:03:32.430 --> 00:03:32.440 
transformation so I don't care how

00:03:32.440 --> 00:03:34.680 
transformation so I don't care how
challenged<00:03:33.100> you<00:03:33.250> are<00:03:33.430> out<00:03:33.640> there<00:03:33.880> this

challenged you are out there this

00:03:34.690 --> 00:03:36.750 
challenged you are out there this
program<00:03:34.870> is<00:03:35.290> specifically<00:03:36.070> designed<00:03:36.190> for

00:03:36.750 --> 00:03:36.760

those ectomorphs who have a hard time
building<00:03:39.640> muscle<00:03:40.060> I'm<00:03:40.150> really<00:03:40.420> really

00:03:40.560 --> 00:03:40.570 
building muscle I'm really really

00:03:40.570 --> 00:03:42.360 
building muscle I'm really really
excited<00:03:40.690> to<00:03:41.020> show<00:03:41.170> it<00:03:41.290> to<00:03:41.320> you<00:03:41.500> and<00:03:41.709> I'm<00:03:42.220> going

to do some more video response to some

00:03:43.630 --> 00:03:44.729 
to do some more video response to some
of<00:03:43.690> the<00:03:43.750> emails<00:03:43.989> because<00:03:44.230> again<00:03:44.470> there's<00:03:44.650> a

the gym right now tomorrow I'll have
another<00:03:55.300> video<00:03:55.510> response<00:03:56.050> where<00:03:56.230> I<00:03:56.260> look

00:03:56.460 --> 00:03:56.470 
another video response where I look

00:03:56.470 --> 00:03:58.770 
another video response where I look
