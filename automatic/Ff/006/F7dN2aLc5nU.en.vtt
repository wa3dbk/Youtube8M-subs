00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.100
 hi how about i am cece escobar and these 

00:00:02.040 --> 00:00:06.930
 are the beats of beats in picture today what 

00:00:05.100 --> 00:00:09.470
 would happen if an asteroid came 

00:00:06.930 --> 00:00:09.470
 over 

00:00:12.340 --> 00:00:16.030
 we are already getting used to knowing 

00:00:14.320 --> 00:00:17.800
 of asteroids that pass us by that 

00:00:16.030 --> 00:00:19.600
 they happen very close to us 

00:00:17.800 --> 00:00:22.920
 super close or that we even fall 

00:00:19.600 --> 00:00:22.920
 over with the case of Russia 

00:00:25.020 --> 00:00:29.500
 with so many tastes the camera of 

00:00:27.070 --> 00:00:31.869
 representatives of the US convened a 

00:00:29.500 --> 00:00:33.670
 meeting with Charles Browling directive 

00:00:31.869 --> 00:00:36.190
 from NASA to tell him that 

00:00:33.670 --> 00:00:39.040
 would plan the agency to be in case of a 

00:00:36.190 --> 00:00:41.200
 real danger is to say a large meteor 

00:00:39.040 --> 00:00:43.350
 that could end all the 

00:00:41.200 --> 00:00:43.350
 civilization 

00:00:46.940 --> 00:00:52.670
 his answer was to pray there's nothing 

00:00:50.329 --> 00:00:54.589
 do if a meteor comes on us 

00:00:52.670 --> 00:00:56.089
 in the coming weeks in fact there's no 

00:00:54.589 --> 00:00:58.370
 nothing to do for around the 

00:00:56.089 --> 00:01:00.289
 next 20 years if we take into account 

00:00:58.370 --> 00:01:01.940
 that 95 percent of the objects 

00:01:00.289 --> 00:01:04.729
 big ones that fly around the 

00:01:01.940 --> 00:01:07.369
 land have a potential danger of 

00:01:04.729 --> 00:01:09.080
 get rid of, we will understand why the 

00:01:07.369 --> 00:01:11.540
 situation is particularly alarming 

00:01:09.080 --> 00:01:14.180
 that's why the European space program 

00:01:11.540 --> 00:01:16.580
 along with NASA and with Jon Hopkins 

00:01:14.180 --> 00:01:18.320
 develop a project to stop the 

00:01:16.580 --> 00:01:20.990
 next meteor that could be a 

00:01:18.320 --> 00:01:23.179
 real threat that is called we live in 

00:01:20.990 --> 00:01:26.080
 actually they are two asteroids and they are going to 

00:01:23.179 --> 00:01:28.399
 approaching the earth in 2022 

00:01:26.080 --> 00:01:30.560
 everyone plans to send a spaceship 

00:01:28.399 --> 00:01:33.729
 Armageddon type to change its course and 

00:01:30.560 --> 00:01:33.729
 so let's save all of 

00:01:44.409 --> 00:01:47.710
