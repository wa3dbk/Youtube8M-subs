00:00:02.700 --> 00:00:04.249 
what about cloning and the news a few
years<00:00:02.850> ago<00:00:02.970> cloning<00:00:03.449> was<00:00:03.540> a<00:00:03.570> big<00:00:03.810> deal<00:00:03.959> is<00:00:04.140> it

00:00:04.249 --> 00:00:04.259 
years ago cloning was a big deal is it

00:00:04.259 --> 00:00:06.710 
years ago cloning was a big deal is it
okay<00:00:04.470> to<00:00:04.529> clone<00:00:04.980> people<00:00:05.509> well<00:00:06.509> there's<00:00:06.660> quite

00:00:06.710 --> 00:00:06.720 
okay to clone people well there's quite

00:00:06.720 --> 00:00:08.150 
okay to clone people well there's quite
a<00:00:06.810> bit<00:00:06.990> of<00:00:07.080> uncertainty<00:00:07.350> of<00:00:07.680> what<00:00:07.830> may<00:00:07.980> happen

a bit of uncertainty of what may happen
with<00:00:08.460> cloning<00:00:08.730> we're<00:00:08.940> not<00:00:09.059> sure<00:00:09.179> exactly<00:00:09.540> what

00:00:09.830 --> 00:00:09.840 
with cloning we're not sure exactly what

00:00:09.840 --> 00:00:13.220 
with cloning we're not sure exactly what
you<00:00:09.929> might<00:00:10.050> end<00:00:10.200> up<00:00:10.290> with<00:00:10.440> you<00:00:11.219> know<00:00:12.230> half

that<00:01:00.149> one<00:01:00.420> sheep<00:01:01.039> they<00:01:02.039> saw<00:01:02.190> what<00:01:02.280> you<00:01:02.340> think

00:01:02.450 --> 00:01:02.460 
that one sheep they saw what you think

00:01:02.460 --> 00:01:03.860 
that one sheep they saw what you think
about<00:01:02.640> cloning<00:01:02.850> I<00:01:03.059> said<00:01:03.239> man<00:01:03.420> the<00:01:03.510> Sheep<00:01:03.690> can

00:01:03.860 --> 00:01:03.870 
about cloning I said man the Sheep can

00:01:03.870 --> 00:01:05.119 
about cloning I said man the Sheep can
do<00:01:03.989> this<00:01:04.170> a<00:01:04.199> whole<00:01:04.409> lot<00:01:04.619> quicker<00:01:04.799> and<00:01:05.070> cheaper

00:01:05.119 --> 00:01:05.129 
do this a whole lot quicker and cheaper

00:01:05.129 --> 00:01:06.440 
do this a whole lot quicker and cheaper
you<00:01:05.519> know<00:01:05.640> just<00:01:05.850> leave<00:01:05.970> them<00:01:06.090> alone<00:01:06.119> in<00:01:06.390> the

00:01:06.440 --> 00:01:06.450 
you know just leave them alone in the

00:01:06.450 --> 00:01:07.550 
you know just leave them alone in the
pasture<00:01:06.780> and<00:01:06.869> you'll<00:01:06.960> have<00:01:07.080> your<00:01:07.140> baby<00:01:07.200> sheep

00:01:07.550 --> 00:01:07.560 
pasture and you'll have your baby sheep

00:01:07.560 --> 00:01:10.580 
pasture and you'll have your baby sheep
okay<00:01:07.939> not<00:01:08.939> that<00:01:09.119> complicated<00:01:09.420> and<00:01:09.689> dolly<00:01:10.260> aged

00:01:10.580 --> 00:01:10.590 
okay not that complicated and dolly aged

00:01:10.590 --> 00:01:13.270 
okay not that complicated and dolly aged
much<00:01:11.040> faster<00:01:11.549> than<00:01:11.700> normal<00:01:11.850> and<00:01:12.180> died<00:01:12.420> early

00:01:13.270 --> 00:01:13.280 
much faster than normal and died early

00:01:13.280 --> 00:01:16.609 
much faster than normal and died early
okay<00:01:14.340> cloning<00:01:14.850> is<00:01:15.090> happening<00:01:15.960> all<00:01:16.140> over<00:01:16.170> I

00:01:16.609 --> 00:01:16.619 
okay cloning is happening all over I

00:01:16.619 --> 00:01:18.910 
okay cloning is happening all over I
think<00:01:17.130> it's<00:01:17.250> a<00:01:17.340> waste<00:01:17.640> of<00:01:17.939> time<00:01:18.210> and<00:01:18.570> money

00:01:18.910 --> 00:01:18.920 
think it's a waste of time and money

00:01:18.920 --> 00:01:20.870 
think it's a waste of time and money
interesting<00:01:19.920> research<00:01:20.220> I'm<00:01:20.460> not<00:01:20.640> against

00:01:20.870 --> 00:01:20.880 
interesting research I'm not against

00:01:20.880 --> 00:01:22.820 
interesting research I'm not against
research<00:01:21.270> I'm<00:01:21.390> not<00:01:21.509> against<00:01:21.750> science<00:01:22.110> but<00:01:22.799> I

00:01:22.820 --> 00:01:22.830 
research I'm not against science but I

00:01:22.830 --> 00:01:25.609 
research I'm not against science but I
think<00:01:23.040> it's<00:01:23.130> a<00:01:23.189> waste<00:01:23.340> of<00:01:23.490> time<00:01:23.640> and<00:01:24.409> if<00:01:25.409> the

00:01:25.609 --> 00:01:25.619 
think it's a waste of time and if the

00:01:25.619 --> 00:01:27.649 
think it's a waste of time and if the
theory<00:01:25.799> is<00:01:25.979> we're<00:01:26.189> going<00:01:26.340> to<00:01:26.460> clone<00:01:26.820> humans<00:01:27.390> so

00:01:27.649 --> 00:01:27.659 
theory is we're going to clone humans so

00:01:27.659 --> 00:01:29.480 
theory is we're going to clone humans so
that<00:01:27.840> we<00:01:27.900> can<00:01:28.080> have<00:01:28.259> organs<00:01:28.710> to<00:01:28.920> harvest<00:01:29.340> to

00:01:29.480 --> 00:01:29.490 
that we can have organs to harvest to

00:01:29.490 --> 00:01:31.580 
that we can have organs to harvest to
save<00:01:29.700> us<00:01:29.880> from<00:01:30.060> diseases<00:01:30.420> now<00:01:31.259> you've<00:01:31.409> got<00:01:31.560> a
