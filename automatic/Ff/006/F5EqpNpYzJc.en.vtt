other<00:01:04.619> playstation<00:01:05.250> controller<00:01:05.369> ever<00:01:05.820> so<00:01:06.570> for

00:01:06.770 --> 00:01:06.780 
other playstation controller ever so for

00:01:06.780 --> 00:01:08.149 
other playstation controller ever so for
starters<00:01:07.080> it's<00:01:07.229> a<00:01:07.290> little<00:01:07.500> bit<00:01:07.619> bigger<00:01:07.830> and<00:01:08.070> a

00:01:08.149 --> 00:01:08.159 
starters it's a little bit bigger and a

00:01:08.159 --> 00:01:09.890 
starters it's a little bit bigger and a
little<00:01:08.340> bit<00:01:08.430> more<00:01:08.549> ergonomic<00:01:09.119> looking<00:01:09.450> so<00:01:09.840> it

00:01:09.890 --> 00:01:09.900 
little bit more ergonomic looking so it

00:01:09.900 --> 00:01:11.140 
little bit more ergonomic looking so it
almost<00:01:09.990> looks<00:01:10.170> like<00:01:10.380> the<00:01:10.500> cat<00:01:10.650> took<00:01:10.860> some

00:01:11.140 --> 00:01:11.150 
almost looks like the cat took some

00:01:11.150 --> 00:01:14.240 
almost looks like the cat took some

00:01:17.369 --> 00:01:19.160 
that is in my opinion the best
controller<00:01:17.820> ever<00:01:18.119> there's<00:01:18.570> also<00:01:18.780> a<00:01:18.869> touchpad

00:01:19.160 --> 00:01:19.170 
controller ever there's also a touchpad

00:01:19.170 --> 00:01:20.870 
controller ever there's also a touchpad
built<00:01:19.560> in<00:01:19.740> similar<00:01:20.189> to<00:01:20.280> what<00:01:20.369> you'll<00:01:20.520> find<00:01:20.670> on

00:01:20.870 --> 00:01:20.880 
built in similar to what you'll find on

00:01:20.880 --> 00:01:22.880 
built in similar to what you'll find on
the<00:01:21.000> back<00:01:21.119> of<00:01:21.299> the<00:01:21.390> PS<00:01:21.630> Vita<00:01:21.900> now<00:01:22.500> well<00:01:22.650> I<00:01:22.680> don't

00:01:22.880 --> 00:01:22.890 
the back of the PS Vita now well I don't

00:01:22.890 --> 00:01:24.350 
the back of the PS Vita now well I don't
think<00:01:23.040> this<00:01:23.130> is<00:01:23.189> going<00:01:23.310> to<00:01:23.369> be<00:01:23.490> a<00:01:23.520> huge<00:01:23.850> deal<00:01:24.090> it

00:01:24.350 --> 00:01:24.360 
think this is going to be a huge deal it

00:01:24.360 --> 00:01:25.580 
think this is going to be a huge deal it
will<00:01:24.509> be<00:01:24.659> nice<00:01:24.810> for<00:01:24.840> some<00:01:25.200> games<00:01:25.409> like

00:01:25.580 --> 00:01:25.590 
will be nice for some games like

00:01:25.590 --> 00:01:27.260 
will be nice for some games like
LittleBigPlanet<00:01:26.369> now<00:01:26.820> on<00:01:26.909> top<00:01:27.090> of<00:01:27.210> that

00:01:27.260 --> 00:01:27.270 
LittleBigPlanet now on top of that

00:01:27.270 --> 00:01:28.370 
LittleBigPlanet now on top of that
there's<00:01:27.450> also<00:01:27.689> what's<00:01:27.990> basically<00:01:28.170> a

00:01:28.370 --> 00:01:28.380 
there's also what's basically a

00:01:28.380 --> 00:01:30.380 
there's also what's basically a
PlayStation<00:01:29.009> Move<00:01:29.159> also<00:01:29.610> built<00:01:29.790> into<00:01:29.970> the<00:01:30.150> top

00:01:30.380 --> 00:01:30.390 
PlayStation Move also built into the top

00:01:30.390 --> 00:01:32.300 
PlayStation Move also built into the top
there's<00:01:31.049> a<00:01:31.140> little<00:01:31.350> window<00:01:31.500> on<00:01:31.650> the<00:01:31.860> top<00:01:32.040> with

00:01:32.300 --> 00:01:32.310 
there's a little window on the top with

00:01:32.310 --> 00:01:33.830 
there's a little window on the top with
different<00:01:32.610> light<00:01:32.790> switch<00:01:33.119> the<00:01:33.329> cameras<00:01:33.689> on

00:01:33.830 --> 00:01:33.840 
different light switch the cameras on

00:01:33.840 --> 00:01:35.060 
different light switch the cameras on
the<00:01:33.930> PlayStation<00:01:34.350> 4<00:01:34.380> will<00:01:34.590> be<00:01:34.680> able<00:01:34.799> to<00:01:34.920> pick

00:01:35.060 --> 00:01:35.070 
the PlayStation 4 will be able to pick

00:01:35.070 --> 00:01:37.429 
the PlayStation 4 will be able to pick
up<00:01:35.100> which<00:01:35.759> I<00:01:36.329> don't<00:01:36.720> really<00:01:36.840> think<00:01:36.960> that<00:01:37.229> I<00:01:37.259> was

00:01:37.429 --> 00:01:37.439 
up which I don't really think that I was

00:01:37.439 --> 00:01:39.380 
up which I don't really think that I was
ever<00:01:37.560> a<00:01:37.650> huge<00:01:37.890> fan<00:01:38.130> of<00:01:38.159> the<00:01:38.369> move<00:01:38.579> however

00:01:39.380 --> 00:01:39.390 
ever a huge fan of the move however

00:01:39.390 --> 00:01:40.940 
ever a huge fan of the move however
since<00:01:39.720> it<00:01:39.900> is<00:01:40.049> going<00:01:40.229> to<00:01:40.320> be<00:01:40.380> built<00:01:40.590> into<00:01:40.799> the

00:01:40.940 --> 00:01:40.950 
since it is going to be built into the

00:01:40.950 --> 00:01:41.870 
since it is going to be built into the
controller<00:01:41.310> you<00:01:41.430> don't<00:01:41.640> have<00:01:41.729> to<00:01:41.790> buy

00:01:41.870 --> 00:01:41.880 
controller you don't have to buy

00:01:41.880 --> 00:01:43.100 
controller you don't have to buy
anything<00:01:42.119> else<00:01:42.390> or<00:01:42.689> you<00:01:42.810> know<00:01:42.869> deal<00:01:43.079> with

00:01:43.100 --> 00:01:43.110 
anything else or you know deal with

00:01:43.110 --> 00:01:44.840 
anything else or you know deal with
add-ons<00:01:43.560> and<00:01:43.710> all<00:01:43.799> that<00:01:43.920> kind<00:01:44.100> of<00:01:44.130> stuff<00:01:44.250> I<00:01:44.579> do

00:01:44.840 --> 00:01:44.850 
add-ons and all that kind of stuff I do

00:01:44.850 --> 00:01:46.310 
add-ons and all that kind of stuff I do
think<00:01:45.119> it<00:01:45.210> will<00:01:45.299> be<00:01:45.420> pretty<00:01:45.600> nice<00:01:45.810> to<00:01:45.960> have<00:01:45.990> for

00:01:46.310 --> 00:01:46.320 
think it will be pretty nice to have for

00:01:46.320 --> 00:01:47.630 
think it will be pretty nice to have for
motion<00:01:46.470> gaming<00:01:46.740> on<00:01:47.009> the<00:01:47.130> PlayStation<00:01:47.610> 4

00:01:47.630 --> 00:01:47.640 
motion gaming on the PlayStation 4

00:01:47.640 --> 00:01:50.389 
motion gaming on the PlayStation 4
number<00:01:48.390> three<00:01:48.659> is<00:01:48.869> that<00:01:48.899> updating<00:01:49.530> is<00:01:49.649> way<00:01:50.009> way

00:01:50.389 --> 00:01:50.399 
number three is that updating is way way

00:01:50.399 --> 00:01:52.580 
number three is that updating is way way
way<00:01:50.430> easier<00:01:50.810> so<00:01:51.810> I'm<00:01:51.869> sure<00:01:52.049> if<00:01:52.140> you<00:01:52.229> guys<00:01:52.350> have

00:02:05.420 --> 00:02:05.430 
pretty much entirely silently in the

00:02:05.430 --> 00:02:07.100 
pretty much entirely silently in the
background<00:02:05.520> even<00:02:06.060> when<00:02:06.360> the<00:02:06.450> console<00:02:06.810> is<00:02:06.960> off

00:02:07.100 --> 00:02:07.110 
background even when the console is off

00:02:07.110 --> 00:02:08.749 
background even when the console is off
on<00:02:07.829> top<00:02:08.099> of<00:02:08.190> that<00:02:08.250> there<00:02:08.399> are<00:02:08.459> also<00:02:08.580> a<00:02:08.700> couple

00:02:08.749 --> 00:02:08.759 
on top of that there are also a couple

00:02:08.759 --> 00:02:10.400 
on top of that there are also a couple
of<00:02:09.000> other<00:02:09.149> cool<00:02:09.360> things<00:02:09.629> for<00:02:09.959> example<00:02:10.319> when

00:02:10.400 --> 00:02:10.410 
of other cool things for example when

00:02:10.410 --> 00:02:11.869 
of other cool things for example when
you<00:02:10.500> turn<00:02:10.679> the<00:02:10.770> console<00:02:11.129> off<00:02:11.370> it<00:02:11.790> actually

00:02:11.869 --> 00:02:11.879 
you turn the console off it actually

00:02:11.879 --> 00:02:13.400 
you turn the console off it actually
goes<00:02:12.180> into<00:02:12.420> what's<00:02:12.569> basically<00:02:12.959> sleep<00:02:13.230> mode

00:02:13.400 --> 00:02:13.410 
goes into what's basically sleep mode

00:02:13.410 --> 00:02:13.730 
goes into what's basically sleep mode
like

00:02:13.730 --> 00:02:13.740 
like

00:02:13.740 --> 00:02:15.530 
like
a<00:02:13.770> PC<00:02:14.250> so<00:02:14.790> if<00:02:14.850> you<00:02:14.940> want<00:02:15.090> to<00:02:15.150> jump<00:02:15.240> back<00:02:15.390> into

00:02:15.530 --> 00:02:15.540 
a PC so if you want to jump back into

00:02:15.540 --> 00:02:16.940 
a PC so if you want to jump back into
the<00:02:15.720> game<00:02:15.900> instead<00:02:16.290> having<00:02:16.440> to<00:02:16.560> wait<00:02:16.710> for<00:02:16.890> it

00:02:16.940 --> 00:02:16.950 
the game instead having to wait for it

00:02:16.950 --> 00:02:17.990 
the game instead having to wait for it
to<00:02:16.980> boot<00:02:17.160> up<00:02:17.310> and<00:02:17.490> all<00:02:17.550> that<00:02:17.700> kind<00:02:17.880> of<00:02:17.910> stuff

00:02:17.990 --> 00:02:18.000 
to boot up and all that kind of stuff

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:19.100 
to boot up and all that kind of stuff
you'll<00:02:18.450> pretty<00:02:18.600> much<00:02:18.750> shoot<00:02:18.900> you<00:02:19.050> straight

00:02:19.100 --> 00:02:19.110 
you'll pretty much shoot you straight

00:02:19.110 --> 00:02:20.150 
you'll pretty much shoot you straight
back<00:02:19.440> into<00:02:19.590> the<00:02:19.680> game

00:02:20.150 --> 00:02:20.160 
back into the game

00:02:20.160 --> 00:02:21.500 
back into the game
another<00:02:20.460> cool<00:02:20.700> behind-the-scenes<00:02:21.060> feature

00:02:21.500 --> 00:02:21.510 
another cool behind-the-scenes feature

00:02:21.510 --> 00:02:23.090 
another cool behind-the-scenes feature
on<00:02:21.690> the<00:02:21.780> ps4<00:02:22.020> is<00:02:22.470> that<00:02:22.650> will<00:02:22.740> allow<00:02:22.950> you<00:02:23.010> to

00:02:23.090 --> 00:02:23.100 
on the ps4 is that will allow you to

00:02:23.100 --> 00:02:24.770 
on the ps4 is that will allow you to
actually<00:02:23.280> play<00:02:23.580> games<00:02:23.910> as<00:02:24.060> you<00:02:24.300> download<00:02:24.480> them
