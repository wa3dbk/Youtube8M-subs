00:04:46.779 --> 00:04:46.789 
really great experiences behind the

00:04:46.789 --> 00:04:48.610 
really great experiences behind the
wheel<00:04:46.940> and<00:04:47.240> you<00:04:47.330> dive<00:04:47.569> down<00:04:47.840> into<00:04:47.900> the<00:04:48.199> corners

00:04:48.610 --> 00:04:48.620 
wheel and you dive down into the corners

00:04:48.620 --> 00:04:52.779 
wheel and you dive down into the corners
let<00:04:48.919> the<00:04:49.039> car<00:04:49.250> rotate<00:04:51.039> now<00:04:52.039> towards<00:04:52.490> the<00:04:52.580> wall

00:04:52.779 --> 00:04:52.789 
let the car rotate now towards the wall

00:04:52.789 --> 00:04:56.830 
let the car rotate now towards the wall
think<00:04:53.270> we'll<00:04:53.539> squeal<00:04:53.990> that

00:04:56.830 --> 00:04:56.840 

00:04:56.840 --> 00:04:59.549 

definitely

00:04:59.549 --> 00:04:59.559 
definitely

00:04:59.559 --> 00:05:00.899 
definitely
definitely<00:05:00.099> stables<00:05:00.579> he<00:05:00.669> could<00:05:00.819> have

00:05:00.899 --> 00:05:00.909 
definitely stables he could have

00:05:00.909 --> 00:05:06.399 
definitely stables he could have

00:05:09.450 --> 00:05:09.460 
rates for once work

00:05:09.460 --> 00:05:11.610

and<00:05:09.880> that's<00:05:10.660> probably<00:05:11.080> one<00:05:11.290> of<00:05:11.320> the<00:05:11.440> best

00:05:11.610 --> 00:05:11.620 
and that's probably one of the best

00:05:11.620 --> 00:05:13.560

parts<00:05:11.980> of<00:05:12.190> the<00:05:12.310> car<00:05:12.550> is<00:05:12.700> the<00:05:12.850> ability<00:05:13.120> to<00:05:13.390> let
