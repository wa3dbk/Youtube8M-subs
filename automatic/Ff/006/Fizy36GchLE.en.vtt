00:00:23.340 --> 00:00:28.110
 that's music and because we have this 

00:00:26.070 --> 00:00:30.660
 have great engine sound is today 

00:00:28.110 --> 00:00:34.370
 car image wish concert for the start 

00:00:30.660 --> 00:00:35.940
 the dodge charger hellcat with 7 117 ps 

00:00:34.370 --> 00:00:38.430
 supposedly the fastest 

00:00:35.940 --> 00:00:39.750
 family limousine in the world good that 

00:00:38.430 --> 00:00:41.400
 we can find out now at one 

00:00:39.750 --> 00:00:43.440
 boring color quite a bit 

00:00:41.400 --> 00:00:44.699
 Cruising on the highway or us 

00:00:43.440 --> 00:00:47.220
 go with the hellcat here on the 

00:00:44.699 --> 00:00:50.930
 racetrack and take take it okay 

00:00:47.220 --> 00:00:50.930
 has decided to take action 

00:00:52.350 --> 00:00:57.190
 Let's have the smoke made 

00:00:55.180 --> 00:00:59.290
 but first robin forgive again 

00:00:57.190 --> 00:01:03.370
 come down and take a look 

00:00:59.290 --> 00:01:04.960
 the charger srt8 on the basis a roof 

00:01:03.370 --> 00:01:07.030
 and the back doors has become 

00:01:04.960 --> 00:01:09.190
 externally everything compared to the predecessor 

00:01:07.030 --> 00:01:11.290
 changed by the enlarged radiator 

00:01:09.190 --> 00:01:14.170
 Opening the black painted bumper 

00:01:11.290 --> 00:01:15.840
 as well as the c shaped LED daytime running lights 

00:01:14.170 --> 00:01:18.790
 the hellcat looks grim and 

00:01:15.840 --> 00:01:20.280
 aggressive in the cockpit you have a lot 

00:01:18.790 --> 00:01:23.380
 Buy plastic 

00:01:20.280 --> 00:01:25.840
 but at the latest when starting the 6.2 

00:01:23.380 --> 00:01:27.970
 liter big v8 also make meticulous 

00:01:25.840 --> 00:01:30.149
 German cars journalists the bitch 

00:01:27.970 --> 00:01:30.149
 1 

00:01:34.600 --> 00:01:42.980
 the rest of the technical data performance 

00:01:37.820 --> 00:01:45.230
 7 117 ps maximum torque 881 

00:01:42.980 --> 00:01:47.330
 newton meter from zero to hundred it goes 

00:01:45.230 --> 00:01:52.340
 in 3 7 seconds 

00:01:47.330 --> 00:01:55.040
 topspeed 328 km / h you can unfortunately 

00:01:52.340 --> 00:01:57.470
 not go out in the useage therefore 

00:01:55.040 --> 00:01:59.060
 to reach the drift before we go 

00:01:57.470 --> 00:02:00.320
 must be able to drift on the race track 

00:01:59.060 --> 00:02:01.430
 I am here but a system of that 

00:02:00.320 --> 00:02:02.330
 hellcat still a few settings 

00:02:01.430 --> 00:02:04.460
 make 

00:02:02.330 --> 00:02:06.470
 i go for that in the menu i have 

00:02:04.460 --> 00:02:08.510
 different selection points goes away 

00:02:06.470 --> 00:02:09.979
 on track then everything is unlocked 

00:02:08.510 --> 00:02:11.150
 except for one thing that the 

00:02:09.979 --> 00:02:13.190
 traction control 

00:02:11.150 --> 00:02:15.500
 I have to change that again by myself 

00:02:13.190 --> 00:02:18.030
 a little longer to sp button press and 

00:02:15.500 --> 00:02:20.340
 wait and wait 

00:02:18.030 --> 00:02:22.380
 now he is complaining he is free 

00:02:20.340 --> 00:02:23.670
 now no one intervenes 

00:02:22.380 --> 00:02:28.050
 And now not even the bock also across 

00:02:23.670 --> 00:02:31.490
 are the wide slips in 

00:02:28.050 --> 00:02:34.440
 format 275 40 at operating temperature 

00:02:31.490 --> 00:02:36.270
 bollert the engine basslastig going on in 

00:02:34.440 --> 00:02:38.430
 Contrast to sound optimized 

00:02:36.270 --> 00:02:40.920
 The competition dominates the aggregates of competition 

00:02:38.430 --> 00:02:41.489
 v8 of hellcat a wide range of 

00:02:40.920 --> 00:02:43.980
 sound 

00:02:41.489 --> 00:02:46.410
 in addition to the global babble and 

00:02:43.980 --> 00:02:48.540
 Five of the compressor spit like hui buh 

00:02:46.410 --> 00:02:50.100
 the castle ghost so that one 

00:02:48.540 --> 00:02:52.380
 set up the hackles 

00:02:50.100 --> 00:02:54.269
 on the course can be the 18 tons 

00:02:52.380 --> 00:02:56.670
 heavy hell cat playing easily in 

00:02:54.269 --> 00:02:58.769
 the curves over control the mighty 

00:02:56.670 --> 00:03:02.900
 brembo brakes has no problems with 

00:02:58.769 --> 00:03:02.900
 loss of control to capture the charger 

00:03:34.770 --> 00:03:39.490
 okay we still have enough profile on the 

00:03:37.960 --> 00:03:40.810
 Ripen to come home 

00:03:39.490 --> 00:03:43.030
 but what about such a serious one 

00:03:40.810 --> 00:03:45.640
 crane on the racetrack to be on the way 

00:03:43.030 --> 00:03:47.890
 easy hammer has despite the weight 

00:03:45.640 --> 00:03:50.650
 he is incredibly precise the chassis 

00:03:47.890 --> 00:03:53.740
 stiff and the steering angle also scary 

00:03:50.650 --> 00:03:57.010
 so great and so honest 

00:03:53.740 --> 00:03:58.720
 with 881 newton meters on the rear axle 

00:03:57.010 --> 00:04:01.170
 he goes off like a rabbit 

00:03:58.720 --> 00:04:01.170
 ecstasy 

00:04:02.730 --> 00:04:07.990
 in the usa you can ride on the highway 

00:04:05.470 --> 00:04:08.590
 the limousine in eco-mode comfortable 

00:04:07.990 --> 00:04:10.630
 cruise 

00:04:08.590 --> 00:04:12.930
 that's why the chassis of the hellcat 

00:04:10.630 --> 00:04:15.400
 impressively balanced 

00:04:12.930 --> 00:04:17.620
 family excursion can be the muscle car so 

00:04:15.400 --> 00:04:19.329
 even on request even with four point 

00:04:17.620 --> 00:04:22.060
 gurt child sitting by german 

00:04:19.329 --> 00:04:23.580
 well, please robbins adrenaline is 

00:04:22.060 --> 00:04:26.290
 back to normal level 

00:04:23.580 --> 00:04:27.580
 so be brave now the editorial 

00:04:26.290 --> 00:04:28.870
 said I can not just go through 

00:04:27.580 --> 00:04:31.030
 I have to turn one more , too 

00:04:28.870 --> 00:04:31.770
 Do something to tell the dare 

00:04:31.030 --> 00:04:34.840
 I like 

00:04:31.770 --> 00:04:39.160
 most important point of the dodge charger stops 

00:04:34.840 --> 00:04:42.760
 costs here in the usa from 64,000 dollars 

00:04:39.160 --> 00:04:43.900
 These are hammer price hammer for that 

00:04:42.760 --> 00:04:45.970
 I also buy one or the other 

00:04:43.900 --> 00:04:48.720
 Take plastic meadow here 

00:04:45.970 --> 00:04:53.080
 or even this cheaper carbon 

00:04:48.720 --> 00:04:55.210
 cup is unique but anyway 

00:04:53.080 --> 00:04:56.650
 so it's all about achievement me 

00:04:55.210 --> 00:04:58.480
 I have nice sport steering wheel 

00:04:56.650 --> 00:04:59.710
 sensible sports seats that give good ones 

00:04:58.480 --> 00:05:01.660
 Seitenhalt I was lucky 

00:04:59.710 --> 00:05:03.669
 germany me the red 

00:05:01.660 --> 00:05:06.580
 given a key because only with it 

00:05:03.669 --> 00:05:07.810
 I also gives the power of 7 117 ps 

00:05:06.580 --> 00:05:09.940
 another black key 

00:05:07.810 --> 00:05:12.220
 then only 500 ps are available 

00:05:09.940 --> 00:05:13.930
 disposal and the esp relies relatively 

00:05:12.220 --> 00:05:16.630
 I have the red key early 

00:05:13.930 --> 00:05:18.820
 connected to the red key the 

00:05:16.630 --> 00:05:20.660
 full power and I'll give it now 

00:05:18.820 --> 00:05:22.470
 times 

00:05:20.660 --> 00:05:26.600
 a 

00:05:22.470 --> 00:05:26.600
 Being angry has never been so good 

00:05:33.800 --> 00:05:37.980
 Here in New Jersey, the sun goes down 

00:05:35.910 --> 00:05:39.720
 and it's time to celebrate in the driver's camp 

00:05:37.980 --> 00:05:42.570
 time for a conclusion 

00:05:39.720 --> 00:05:43.920
 but since you do not have a normal driving report 

00:05:42.570 --> 00:05:44.370
 wanted to you that not 

00:05:43.920 --> 00:05:45.570
 deliver 

00:05:44.370 --> 00:05:47.580
 we can not tell you if it is 

00:05:45.570 --> 00:05:48.030
 makes sense here 7 117 ps rhine too 

00:05:47.580 --> 00:05:49.350
 pack 

00:05:48.030 --> 00:05:50.640
 we can not tell you if that either 

00:05:49.350 --> 00:05:52.800
 really the fastest families the 

00:05:50.640 --> 00:05:55.160
 But museums of the world are one thing they can do 

00:05:52.800 --> 00:05:59.210
 we can tell you more fun you can for 

00:05:55.160 --> 00:05:59.210
 Do not have $ 64,000 

00:05:59.510 --> 00:06:05.870
 yes it was a torture for rubber no matter 

00:06:03.450 --> 00:06:09.140
 The paper can neither the bmw m5 with 

00:06:05.870 --> 00:06:13.500
 560 ps of the porsche panamera turbo s with 

00:06:09.140 --> 00:06:18.540
 570 ps or the Mercedes AMG S 65 with 

00:06:13.500 --> 00:06:21.210
 630 ps the 7 117 ps and 6.2 

00:06:18.540 --> 00:06:23.840
 impress with liter big v8 and the 

00:06:21.210 --> 00:06:26.730
 Price certainly not for the round 

00:06:23.840 --> 00:06:27.810
 64,000 dollars to go the pact with the 

00:06:26.730 --> 00:06:31.340
 hell cat 1 

00:06:27.810 --> 00:06:31.340
 at least in the usa
