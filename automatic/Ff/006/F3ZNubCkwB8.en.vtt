00:00:35.280 --> 00:00:40.300
 a cool feeling now I believe if 

00:00:38.470 --> 00:00:42.430
 the feeling when you just ran out 

00:00:40.300 --> 00:00:43.960
 say no before the match 

00:00:42.430 --> 00:00:47.200
 to be able to have that our real 

00:00:43.960 --> 00:00:48.820
 desired to be able to accumulate once and 

00:00:47.200 --> 00:00:50.980
 then into play with his 

00:00:48.820 --> 00:00:52.360
 emotionality with thus only rear 

00:00:50.980 --> 00:00:55.890
 located 2 1 win and the same great 

00:00:52.360 --> 00:00:57.970
 this club needs a while until now 

00:00:55.890 --> 00:00:59.860
 to grab and enjoy 

00:00:57.970 --> 00:01:02.200
 I think we have a vocal circle 

00:00:59.860 --> 00:01:04.180
 said from the game 

00:01:02.200 --> 00:01:06.640
 away game as a signal so beautiful me 

00:01:04.180 --> 00:01:08.290
 think that is the outstanding as many 

00:01:06.640 --> 00:01:10.810
 people assume heidenheim with coming 

00:01:08.290 --> 00:01:12.790
 believe our old son our monday 

00:01:10.810 --> 00:01:14.050
 Hard knows what live in freetv comes to us 

00:01:12.790 --> 00:01:14.970
 he thinks he can do it all 

00:01:14.050 --> 00:01:17.920
 be proud of 

00:01:14.970 --> 00:01:19.930
 Of course , first of all, a great experience 

00:01:17.920 --> 00:01:20.440
 that was finally allowed to experience here 

00:01:19.930 --> 00:01:23.160
 to play 

00:01:20.440 --> 00:01:25.060
 and yes, it was relatively balanced 

00:01:23.160 --> 00:01:25.810
 faith has a lot between 16 

00:01:25.060 --> 00:01:28.479
 place 

00:01:25.810 --> 00:01:30.850
 and yes, that's eleven meters 

00:01:28.479 --> 00:01:32.140
 But Germany will be us then 

00:01:30.850 --> 00:01:34.210
 have come out except halftime we 

00:01:32.140 --> 00:01:36.160
 We really pushed 60 into it 

00:01:34.210 --> 00:01:37.150
 earned us opportunities they have 

00:01:36.160 --> 00:01:39.640
 come by chance but really 

00:01:37.150 --> 00:01:41.890
 also played at the number he has 

00:01:39.640 --> 00:01:44.050
 then at some point it was clear that we were out 

00:01:41.890 --> 00:01:46.509
 same goal relatively fast too and 

00:01:44.050 --> 00:01:47.920
 then hit standard hit 2 1 

00:01:46.509 --> 00:01:49.720
 Maybe we have to make it out of it 

00:01:47.920 --> 00:01:50.110
 even decide by a third 

00:01:49.720 --> 00:01:52.300
 gate 

00:01:50.110 --> 00:01:53.800
 but then we meet her we are 

00:01:52.300 --> 00:01:55.929
 stable have stood nothing 

00:01:53.800 --> 00:01:57.729
 admitted and if you are quite bitter 

00:01:55.929 --> 00:01:58.720
 a deserved victory for us and yes, yes 

00:01:57.729 --> 00:02:02.380
 I perfectly measured in the second half 

00:01:58.720 --> 00:02:04.300
 started yes I think it is real 

00:02:02.380 --> 00:02:05.740
 Crazy a crime arrived 

00:02:04.300 --> 00:02:09.340
 other that the audience from the 

00:02:05.740 --> 00:02:11.890
 concerns only in Hamburg with 1200 1300 

00:02:09.340 --> 00:02:14.710
 100 first victory now we are 2009 

00:02:11.890 --> 00:02:15.910
 pick second away win measurable 

00:02:14.710 --> 00:02:16.720
 is a bit of a spectator what we are 

00:02:15.910 --> 00:02:17.380
 must do the next 

00:02:16.720 --> 00:02:19.480
 away games 

00:02:17.380 --> 00:02:20.740
 but of course we are glad that we 

00:02:19.480 --> 00:02:22.390
 so many have supported here today 

00:02:20.740 --> 00:02:24.100
 Locally and luckily we were able to 

00:02:22.390 --> 00:02:27.160
 his victories were also admitted to the victory 

00:02:24.100 --> 00:02:29.319
 Just come as you can see 

00:02:27.160 --> 00:02:30.750
 but twice abroad once could 

00:02:29.319 --> 00:02:37.920
 Pauli once 

00:02:30.750 --> 00:02:39.330
 the arena is of course outstanding 

00:02:37.920 --> 00:02:41.310
 You can not complain that was amazing 

00:02:39.330 --> 00:02:43.680
 how massaged and you look at the curve 

00:02:41.310 --> 00:02:45.510
 completely full just makes fun so 

00:02:43.680 --> 00:02:46.770
 we continue to work hard in 

00:02:45.510 --> 00:02:47.310
 the first half in your own 

00:02:46.770 --> 00:02:50.640
 in possession 

00:02:47.310 --> 00:02:51.930
 The opponent has pressed us well too 

00:02:50.640 --> 00:02:54.420
 one or the other error forced 

00:02:51.930 --> 00:02:56.280
 this was that when we pointed to the 

00:02:54.420 --> 00:02:59.000
 that we have the one or the other 

00:02:56.280 --> 00:03:01.230
 other two I could hold on 

00:02:59.000 --> 00:03:03.360
 anyway, so that was despite this 

00:03:01.230 --> 00:03:05.220
 optical superiority we do not 

00:03:03.360 --> 00:03:06.540
 have allowed correct chances 

00:03:05.220 --> 00:03:09.690
 then it came to an unnecessary 

00:03:06.540 --> 00:03:11.040
 ball loss in the game setup where we do that 

00:03:09.690 --> 00:03:14.880
 want to relocate game on our left 

00:03:11.040 --> 00:03:17.489
 Side lose the ball and then do 

00:03:14.880 --> 00:03:19.560
 the hand play in the 16 okotie makes the 1 0 

00:03:17.489 --> 00:03:21.959
 and then it looked like that 

00:03:19.560 --> 00:03:23.790
 all trumps lie with the opponent 

00:03:21.959 --> 00:03:25.739
 we had a lot until half-time 

00:03:23.790 --> 00:03:27.540
 But ball possession could not do us any 

00:03:25.739 --> 00:03:29.430
 chances earn in the mid-term 

00:03:27.540 --> 00:03:31.200
 I said to the team 

00:03:29.430 --> 00:03:32.550
 are now the offensive play 

00:03:31.200 --> 00:03:34.230
 we will change with much more 

00:03:32.550 --> 00:03:35.730
 self-awareness we go out to 

00:03:34.230 --> 00:03:39.000
 try to play fast outside 

00:03:35.730 --> 00:03:41.610
 and the second half the first chance 

00:03:39.000 --> 00:03:43.709
 right after half-time 

00:03:41.610 --> 00:03:45.060
 we basically many actions many 

00:03:43.709 --> 00:03:46.709
 Chances played out 

00:03:45.060 --> 00:03:48.810
 it was a bit like a game on 

00:03:46.709 --> 00:03:50.700
 and consequently also have the 

00:03:48.810 --> 00:03:51.870
 have made up for compensation 

00:03:50.700 --> 00:03:54.480
 after the yellow-red card 

00:03:51.870 --> 00:03:56.430
 if you have to accuse us is that 

00:03:54.480 --> 00:03:58.650
 we from these insanely many 

00:03:56.430 --> 00:03:59.820
 one hundred percent chances for not 

00:03:58.650 --> 00:04:01.709
 the final decision taken care of 

00:03:59.820 --> 00:04:03.510
 we have to do that 3 1 

00:04:01.709 --> 00:04:04.920
 because even in deficit it is in the opponent 

00:04:03.510 --> 00:04:06.660
 always possible shortly before closing again 

00:04:04.920 --> 00:04:09.360
 to come back but under the dash 

00:04:06.660 --> 00:04:11.220
 Compliments especially for the second 

00:04:09.360 --> 00:04:12.360
 half time there was really strong and has 

00:04:11.220 --> 00:04:12.989
 the game ultimately deserves 

00:04:12.360 --> 00:04:16.799
 won 

00:04:12.989 --> 00:04:19.130
 thank you program together yes I have 

00:04:16.799 --> 00:04:23.220
 so seen that in fact currently 

00:04:19.130 --> 00:04:24.510
 Actually, there was something going on here for us 

00:04:23.220 --> 00:04:26.310
 I was the one to criticize 

00:04:24.510 --> 00:04:27.570
 Team also said that in the reason 

00:04:26.310 --> 00:04:31.229
 taken from the effort we 

00:04:27.570 --> 00:04:33.390
 Actually we have too 

00:04:31.229 --> 00:04:34.880
 We have had little capital hit 

00:04:33.390 --> 00:04:36.530
 too little 

00:04:34.880 --> 00:04:38.860
 Last balls played too few 

00:04:36.530 --> 00:04:41.990
 compelling opportunities and there 

00:04:38.860 --> 00:04:43.970
 played out and on it too 

00:04:41.990 --> 00:04:46.040
 pointed out that we in the second 

00:04:43.970 --> 00:04:47.960
 half past our attacks just yet 

00:04:46.040 --> 00:04:50.840
 must play more consistently to the end 

00:04:47.960 --> 00:04:52.940
 that was the march route in the reason for 

00:04:50.840 --> 00:04:54.200
 the second half what the frank in 

00:04:52.940 --> 00:04:56.510
 the first half at his 

00:04:54.200 --> 00:04:58.340
 has criticized that team 

00:04:56.510 --> 00:05:00.860
 they did not tie balls in front 

00:04:58.340 --> 00:05:04.130
 was then the problem with us in 

00:05:00.860 --> 00:05:07.030
 the second half heidenheim has in 

00:05:04.130 --> 00:05:10.580
 that did more pressure 

00:05:07.030 --> 00:05:12.800
 we were prepared for it we wanted 

00:05:10.580 --> 00:05:14.900
 wanted to actively approach the whole thing 

00:05:12.800 --> 00:05:17.960
 continue to play forward and how 

00:05:14.900 --> 00:05:21.860
 then also force then to say 

00:05:17.960 --> 00:05:24.140
 to finally close the bag and javi 

00:05:21.860 --> 00:05:25.300
 it was not for us at all 

00:05:24.140 --> 00:05:27.500
 successful 

00:05:25.300 --> 00:05:29.930
 Heidenheim was indeed after the 

00:05:27.500 --> 00:05:32.990
 half time on the pusher then has the 

00:05:29.930 --> 00:05:35.960
 compensated and with the yellow red 

00:05:32.990 --> 00:05:39.920
 Of course, the map was the situation 

00:05:35.960 --> 00:05:42.010
 made difficult for us again and Heidenheim 

00:05:39.920 --> 00:05:44.350
 has that in a standard situation 

00:05:42.010 --> 00:05:46.960
 exploited 

00:05:44.350 --> 00:05:50.270
 Under the stroke you have to say very clearly 

00:05:46.960 --> 00:05:52.250
 only half time went to us in the phase 

00:05:50.270 --> 00:05:54.980
 we just shot a goal 

00:05:52.250 --> 00:05:56.320
 and Heidenheim had the second half 

00:05:54.980 --> 00:06:00.080
 on his side 

00:05:56.320 --> 00:06:02.810
 partially in excess and has two gates 

00:06:00.080 --> 00:06:04.850
 and so you have to 

00:06:02.810 --> 00:06:07.450
 acknowledge deservedly won 

00:06:04.850 --> 00:06:07.450
 Thank you very much 

00:06:16.350 --> 00:06:18.440
 the
