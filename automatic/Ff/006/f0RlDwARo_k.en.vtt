00:00:30.460 --> 00:00:30.470 
give it an absolute a number that you

00:00:30.470 --> 00:00:33.850

whole pricing argument is worried about

00:00:40.160 --> 00:00:43.780 
whole pricing argument is worried about
the<00:00:40.810> skill<00:00:41.810> level<00:00:41.840> that<00:00:42.140> you<00:00:42.230> have<00:00:42.470> so<00:00:43.160> once

00:00:46.660 --> 00:00:46.670 
you've got a a a possible or you pass a

00:00:46.670 --> 00:00:49.660 
you've got a a a possible or you pass a
threshold<00:00:47.360> of<00:00:47.630> an<00:00:47.870> acceptable<00:00:48.590> standard<00:00:49.070> then

00:00:49.660 --> 00:00:49.670 
threshold of an acceptable standard then

00:00:49.670 --> 00:00:51.730 
threshold of an acceptable standard then
you<00:00:49.790> can<00:00:49.940> go<00:00:50.090> move<00:00:50.720> on<00:00:50.900> towards<00:00:51.320> I<00:00:51.470> how<00:00:51.590> much

00:00:51.730 --> 00:00:51.740 
you can go move on towards I how much

00:00:51.740 --> 00:00:54.670 
you can go move on towards I how much
you<00:00:51.860> should<00:00:51.890> be<00:00:52.100> charging<00:00:52.430> so<00:00:53.290> you<00:00:54.290> know<00:00:54.440> on

00:00:54.670 --> 00:00:54.680 
you should be charging so you know on

you should be charging so you know on
this<00:00:55.370> is<00:00:55.520> all<00:00:55.670> going<00:00:55.850> on<00:00:56.000> the<00:00:56.090> assumption<00:00:56.420> that

00:00:56.770 --> 00:00:56.780 
this is all going on the assumption that

certain degree so the reason I can do

00:01:28.790 --> 00:01:30.910 
certain degree so the reason I can do
this<00:01:28.940> is<00:01:29.210> based<00:01:29.450> on<00:01:29.659> a<00:01:29.870> few<00:01:30.200> things<00:01:30.229> first<00:01:30.740> of

00:01:30.910 --> 00:01:30.920 
this is based on a few things first of

money when they are starting out and
there's<00:04:52.110> no<00:04:52.200> reason<00:04:52.350> you<00:04:52.440> can't<00:04:53.270> unless<00:04:54.270> you

00:04:55.160 --> 00:04:55.170 
there's no reason you can't unless you

00:04:55.170 --> 00:04:56.510 
there's no reason you can't unless you
don't<00:04:55.320> have<00:04:55.440> the<00:04:55.560> skill<00:04:55.800> to<00:04:55.830> back<00:04:56.070> it<00:04:56.220> up<00:04:56.310> and

00:04:56.510 --> 00:04:56.520 
don't have the skill to back it up and

00:04:56.520 --> 00:04:58.730 
don't have the skill to back it up and
and<00:04:57.390> like<00:04:57.510> I<00:04:57.660> said<00:04:57.720> it's<00:04:58.200> just<00:04:58.320> a<00:04:58.560> certain

00:04:58.730 --> 00:04:58.740 
and like I said it's just a certain

00:04:58.740 --> 00:05:00.620 
and like I said it's just a certain
threshold<00:04:58.980> and<00:04:59.760> once<00:05:00.090> you<00:05:00.180> get<00:05:00.300> over<00:05:00.330> their

00:05:00.620 --> 00:05:00.630 
threshold and once you get over their

00:05:00.630 --> 00:05:02.900 
threshold and once you get over their
threshold<00:05:01.430> essentially<00:05:02.430> it<00:05:02.550> doesn't<00:05:02.820> really

00:05:02.900 --> 00:05:02.910 
threshold essentially it doesn't really

00:05:02.910 --> 00:05:05.210 
threshold essentially it doesn't really
matter<00:05:03.420> how<00:05:03.690> good<00:05:03.900> you<00:05:04.050> are<00:05:04.200> as<00:05:05.070> long<00:05:05.190> as

00:05:05.210 --> 00:05:05.220 
matter how good you are as long as

00:05:05.220 --> 00:05:07.220 
matter how good you are as long as
you're<00:05:05.460> an<00:05:05.580> acceptable<00:05:06.090> standard<00:05:06.480> of<00:05:06.570> a<00:05:06.630> DJ<00:05:07.020> a

00:05:07.220 --> 00:05:07.230 
you're an acceptable standard of a DJ a

00:05:07.230 --> 00:05:09.110 
you're an acceptable standard of a DJ a
lot<00:05:07.800> of<00:05:07.890> guys<00:05:08.010> are<00:05:08.100> going<00:05:08.220> to<00:05:08.280> disagree<00:05:08.880> with

a<00:07:22.470> certain<00:07:23.130> amount<00:07:23.310> of<00:07:23.640> psychology<00:07:24.360> and<00:07:24.420> so<00:07:24.600> I

00:07:24.620 --> 00:07:24.630 
a certain amount of psychology and so I

00:07:24.630 --> 00:07:27.500 
a certain amount of psychology and so I
do<00:07:24.810> yourself<00:07:25.440> to<00:07:25.740> be<00:07:26.190> able<00:07:26.340> to<00:07:26.430> do<00:07:26.580> that<00:07:26.730> but

00:07:27.500 --> 00:07:27.510 
do yourself to be able to do that but

00:07:27.510 --> 00:07:29.720 
do yourself to be able to do that but
it's<00:07:27.690> a<00:07:27.930> completely<00:07:28.560> doable<00:07:28.860> when<00:07:29.340> you<00:07:29.520> know

00:07:29.720 --> 00:07:29.730 
it's a completely doable when you know

00:07:29.730 --> 00:07:32.360 
it's a completely doable when you know
when<00:07:30.210> you<00:07:30.300> do<00:07:30.480> the<00:07:30.570> research<00:07:30.870> into<00:07:31.200> how<00:07:31.370> how

00:07:32.360 --> 00:07:32.370 
when you do the research into how how

00:07:32.370 --> 00:07:35.090 
when you do the research into how how
I've<00:07:32.550> done<00:07:32.760> it<00:07:32.880> and<00:07:33.690> the<00:07:34.380> best<00:07:34.590> place<00:07:34.770> to<00:07:34.920> start

00:07:35.090 --> 00:07:35.100 
I've done it and the best place to start

00:07:35.100 --> 00:07:36.860 
I've done it and the best place to start
it's<00:07:35.670> like<00:07:35.790> I<00:07:35.910> said<00:07:36.090> that<00:07:36.450> book<00:07:36.630> Robert

00:07:36.860 --> 00:07:36.870 
it's like I said that book Robert
