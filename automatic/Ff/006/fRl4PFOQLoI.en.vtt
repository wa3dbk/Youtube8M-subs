00:01:27.410 --> 00:01:27.420 
takes away four bullets in the clip so

00:01:27.420 --> 00:01:29.480 
takes away four bullets in the clip so
the<00:01:27.510> ak-12<00:01:27.840> rip<00:01:28.110> only<00:01:28.350> is<00:01:28.440> 22<00:01:29.010> bolts<00:01:29.340> in<00:01:29.400> the

the ak-12 rip only is 22 bolts in the

00:01:33.590 --> 00:01:33.600 
not is a huge deal and I think that

guys today even better than the ink
it'll<00:01:37.170> rip<00:01:37.740> on<00:01:37.979> its<00:01:38.159> own<00:01:38.340> so<00:01:38.810> like<00:01:39.810> I<00:01:39.900> said<00:01:39.960> it

00:01:40.190 --> 00:01:40.200 
it'll rip on its own so like I said it

00:01:40.200 --> 00:01:41.210 
it'll rip on its own so like I said it
the<00:01:40.260> first<00:01:40.470> I<00:01:40.560> didn't<00:01:40.740> think<00:01:40.799> I<00:01:40.890> could<00:01:40.920> do<00:01:41.130> this

00:01:41.210 --> 00:01:41.220 
the first I didn't think I could do this

00:01:41.220 --> 00:01:43.130 
the first I didn't think I could do this
gun<00:01:41.369> I<00:01:41.400> didn't<00:01:41.700> think<00:01:41.880> I'd<00:01:42.000> be<00:01:42.030> possible<00:01:42.810> to<00:01:43.020> do

00:01:43.130 --> 00:01:43.140 
gun I didn't think I'd be possible to do

00:01:43.140 --> 00:01:44.480 
gun I didn't think I'd be possible to do
it<00:01:43.260> since<00:01:43.380> I<00:01:43.440> have<00:01:43.619> plus<00:01:43.770> one<00:01:43.920> damage<00:01:44.250> but<00:01:44.369> then

00:01:44.480 --> 00:01:44.490 
it since I have plus one damage but then

00:01:44.490 --> 00:01:45.890 
it since I have plus one damage but then
I<00:01:44.580> did<00:01:44.760> some<00:01:44.970> research<00:01:45.330> and<00:01:45.420> you're<00:01:45.570> gonna<00:01:45.659> see

I did some research and you're gonna see

00:01:45.900 --> 00:01:48.200 
I did some research and you're gonna see
the<00:01:46.020> damage<00:01:46.409> for<00:01:47.070> each<00:01:47.220> of<00:01:47.400> the<00:01:47.460> ak-12<00:01:47.850> zombie

the 88 over it because 33 damage at

the 88 over it because 33 damage at
close<00:01:53.040> range<00:01:53.430> which<00:01:53.909> makes<00:01:54.119> it<00:01:54.240> almost<00:01:54.390> always

00:01:54.770 --> 00:01:54.780 
close range which makes it almost always

00:01:57.500 --> 00:01:57.510 
a 3 shot kill which isn't bad you know

00:01:57.510 --> 00:01:59.179 
a 3 shot kill which isn't bad you know
for<00:01:57.689> an<00:01:57.750> assault<00:01:57.990> rifle<00:01:58.350> and<00:01:58.530> at<00:01:58.710> long<00:01:58.920> range

00:01:59.179 --> 00:01:59.189 
for an assault rifle and at long range

00:01:59.189 --> 00:02:02.149 
for an assault rifle and at long range
it's<00:01:59.369> 25<00:02:00.030> damage<00:02:00.509> which<00:02:00.900> makes<00:02:01.110> it<00:02:01.259> a<00:02:01.380> 4<00:02:01.740> shot

00:02:02.149 --> 00:02:02.159 
it's 25 damage which makes it a 4 shot

00:02:02.159 --> 00:02:04.640 
it's 25 damage which makes it a 4 shot
kill<00:02:02.189> so<00:02:02.640> still<00:02:02.909> not<00:02:03.060> bad<00:02:03.240> for<00:02:03.960> the<00:02:04.049> ak-12<00:02:04.380> rift

kill so still not bad for the ak-12 rift

00:02:04.650 --> 00:02:06.770 
kill so still not bad for the ak-12 rift
it's<00:02:05.070> it's<00:02:05.610> good<00:02:05.939> but<00:02:06.180> it's<00:02:06.330> not<00:02:06.450> a<00:02:06.479> huge

00:02:06.770 --> 00:02:06.780 
it's it's good but it's not a huge

00:02:06.780 --> 00:02:08.449 
it's it's good but it's not a huge

different from the normal a k12 through
the<00:02:08.640> ak-12<00:02:08.970> G<00:02:09.330> which<00:02:10.200> does<00:02:10.409> 33<00:02:10.860> up<00:02:10.950> closer<00:02:11.129> than

00:02:11.390 --> 00:02:11.400 
the ak-12 G which does 33 up closer than

the ak-12 G which does 33 up closer than
24<00:02:11.999> at<00:02:12.180> far<00:02:12.359> so<00:02:12.599> literally<00:02:12.930> the<00:02:13.230> one<00:02:13.469> extra

00:02:13.909 --> 00:02:13.919 
24 at far so literally the one extra

00:02:13.919 --> 00:02:14.740 
24 at far so literally the one extra
damage<00:02:14.129> that<00:02:14.549> you

00:02:14.740 --> 00:02:14.750 
damage that you

00:02:14.750 --> 00:02:16.510 
damage that you
see<00:02:14.900> that<00:02:15.320> takes<00:02:15.590> the<00:02:15.740> a<00:02:15.770> Cato's<00:02:16.100> rip<00:02:16.280> from<00:02:16.430> a

00:02:16.510 --> 00:02:16.520 
see that takes the a Cato's rip from a

00:02:16.520 --> 00:02:18.970 
see that takes the a Cato's rip from a
ten<00:02:16.760> damage<00:02:17.120> to<00:02:17.300> an<00:02:17.390> 11<00:02:17.720> damage<00:02:17.990> only<00:02:18.440> does<00:02:18.740> one

00:02:18.970 --> 00:02:18.980 
ten damage to an 11 damage only does one

00:02:18.980 --> 00:02:21.490 
ten damage to an 11 damage only does one
point<00:02:19.400> extra<00:02:20.030> of<00:02:20.180> Health<00:02:20.390> and<00:02:20.630> that's<00:02:20.780> only<00:02:21.110> at

00:02:21.490 --> 00:02:21.500 
point extra of Health and that's only at

00:02:21.500 --> 00:02:23.050 
point extra of Health and that's only at
long<00:02:21.830> range<00:02:22.160> so<00:02:22.340> it's<00:02:22.520> virtually

00:02:23.050 --> 00:02:23.060 
long range so it's virtually

00:02:23.060 --> 00:02:26.080 
long range so it's virtually
unnoticeable<00:02:24.250> like<00:02:25.250> like<00:02:25.550> I<00:02:25.700> said<00:02:25.880> I<00:02:25.910> didn't

00:02:26.080 --> 00:02:26.090 
unnoticeable like like I said I didn't

00:02:26.090 --> 00:02:26.860 
unnoticeable like like I said I didn't
think<00:02:26.120> I<00:02:26.240> was<00:02:26.300> gonna<00:02:26.420> be<00:02:26.510> able<00:02:26.570> do<00:02:26.690> the<00:02:26.810> eight

00:02:26.860 --> 00:02:26.870 
think I was gonna be able do the eight

00:02:26.870 --> 00:02:28.060 
think I was gonna be able do the eight
hits<00:02:26.990> over<00:02:27.170> but<00:02:27.320> then<00:02:27.440> I<00:02:27.470> saw<00:02:27.710> this<00:02:27.830> I'm<00:02:27.950> like

00:02:28.060 --> 00:02:28.070 
hits over but then I saw this I'm like

00:02:28.070 --> 00:02:29.890 
hits over but then I saw this I'm like
you<00:02:28.130> know<00:02:28.220> one<00:02:28.460> point<00:02:28.730> really<00:02:29.270> shouldn't<00:02:29.600> stop

00:02:29.890 --> 00:02:29.900 
you know one point really shouldn't stop

00:02:29.900 --> 00:02:32.199 
you know one point really shouldn't stop
someone<00:02:30.350> from<00:02:30.530> not<00:02:31.459> using<00:02:31.490> a<00:02:31.940> gun<00:02:32.090> or

00:02:32.199 --> 00:02:32.209 
someone from not using a gun or

00:02:32.209 --> 00:02:34.000 
someone from not using a gun or
something<00:02:32.510> like<00:02:32.600> that<00:02:32.660> so<00:02:33.080> I<00:02:33.260> was<00:02:33.709> able<00:02:33.800> to<00:02:33.890> do

00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:34.010 
something like that so I was able to do

00:02:34.010 --> 00:02:35.320 
something like that so I was able to do
a<00:02:34.040> little<00:02:34.160> bit<00:02:34.280> of<00:02:34.370> research<00:02:34.640> and<00:02:34.700> find<00:02:34.970> a<00:02:35.090> gun

00:02:35.320 --> 00:02:35.330 
a little bit of research and find a gun

00:02:35.330 --> 00:02:38.590 
a little bit of research and find a gun
that<00:02:35.660> also<00:02:36.080> had<00:02:36.530> the<00:02:36.910> the<00:02:37.910> look<00:02:38.150> from<00:02:38.330> call<00:02:38.570> of

00:02:38.590 --> 00:02:38.600 
that also had the the look from call of

00:02:38.600 --> 00:02:40.360 
that also had the the look from call of
duty<00:02:38.690> ghosts'<00:02:39.200> and<00:02:39.320> it<00:02:39.380> wasn't<00:02:39.560> like<00:02:39.950> you<00:02:40.190> know

00:02:40.360 --> 00:02:40.370 
duty ghosts' and it wasn't like you know

00:02:40.370 --> 00:02:42.280 
duty ghosts' and it wasn't like you know
there's<00:02:40.910> a<00:02:40.970> difference<00:02:41.270> we<00:02:41.360> need<00:02:41.420> a<00:02:41.780> k-12

00:02:42.280 --> 00:02:42.290 
there's a difference we need a k-12

00:02:42.290 --> 00:02:43.960 
there's a difference we need a k-12
ecology<00:02:42.650> ghost<00:02:42.860> and<00:02:43.070> advanced<00:02:43.310> warfare<00:02:43.430> so

00:02:43.960 --> 00:02:43.970 
ecology ghost and advanced warfare so

00:02:43.970 --> 00:02:45.430 
ecology ghost and advanced warfare so
they've<00:02:44.150> got<00:02:44.240> to<00:02:44.300> find<00:02:44.390> the<00:02:44.510> ak-12<00:02:44.870> G<00:02:45.290> which

00:02:45.430 --> 00:02:45.440 
they've got to find the ak-12 G which

00:02:45.440 --> 00:02:46.840 
they've got to find the ak-12 G which
you<00:02:45.530> get<00:02:45.650> from<00:02:45.770> purchasing<00:02:46.250> the<00:02:46.370> season<00:02:46.670> pass

00:02:46.840 --> 00:02:46.850 
you get from purchasing the season pass

00:02:46.850 --> 00:02:48.370 
you get from purchasing the season pass
which<00:02:47.180> you<00:02:47.720> see<00:02:47.810> on<00:02:47.900> your<00:02:47.989> screen<00:02:48.080> right<00:02:48.320> now

00:02:48.370 --> 00:02:48.380 
which you see on your screen right now

00:02:48.380 --> 00:02:49.750 
which you see on your screen right now
which<00:02:48.530> says<00:02:48.680> no<00:02:48.830> different<00:02:49.190> attributes<00:02:49.580> it's

00:02:49.750 --> 00:02:49.760 
which says no different attributes it's

00:02:49.760 --> 00:02:52.930 
which says no different attributes it's
just<00:02:49.910> exactly<00:02:50.360> the<00:02:50.630> same<00:02:50.840> normal<00:02:51.170> a<00:02:51.320> k12<00:02:51.800> G<00:02:52.070> but

00:02:52.930 --> 00:02:52.940 
just exactly the same normal a k12 G but

00:02:52.940 --> 00:02:54.190 
just exactly the same normal a k12 G but
it<00:02:53.030> looks<00:02:53.209> like<00:02:53.300> the<00:02:53.450> one<00:02:53.600> for<00:02:53.750> ecology<00:02:53.989> goes

00:02:54.190 --> 00:02:54.200 
it looks like the one for ecology goes

00:02:54.200 --> 00:02:57.160 
it looks like the one for ecology goes
and<00:02:54.500> it<00:02:54.620> is<00:02:54.739> golden<00:02:55.190> so<00:02:55.400> if<00:02:55.850> you<00:02:56.120> put<00:02:56.420> on<00:02:56.600> grip

00:02:57.160 --> 00:02:57.170 
and it is golden so if you put on grip

00:02:57.170 --> 00:02:58.780 
and it is golden so if you put on grip
on<00:02:57.410> this<00:02:57.620> gun<00:02:57.830> it<00:02:57.980> increases<00:02:58.430> the<00:02:58.520> accuracy

00:02:58.780 --> 00:02:58.790 
on this gun it increases the accuracy

00:02:58.790 --> 00:03:02.199 
on this gun it increases the accuracy
plus<00:02:59.180> two<00:02:59.570> to<00:02:59.870> be<00:02:59.989> on<00:03:00.200> par<00:03:00.739> with<00:03:01.070> the<00:03:01.489> ak-12

00:03:02.199 --> 00:03:02.209 
plus two to be on par with the ak-12

00:03:02.209 --> 00:03:03.940 
plus two to be on par with the ak-12
r.i.p<00:03:02.570> and<00:03:03.020> then<00:03:03.320> if<00:03:03.410> you<00:03:03.470> put<00:03:03.590> the<00:03:03.680> stock

00:03:03.940 --> 00:03:03.950 
r.i.p and then if you put the stock

00:03:03.950 --> 00:03:05.590 
r.i.p and then if you put the stock
attachment<00:03:04.520> on<00:03:04.580> it<00:03:04.700> it<00:03:04.850> actually<00:03:04.880> it's<00:03:05.300> to

00:03:05.590 --> 00:03:05.600 
attachment on it it actually it's to

00:03:05.600 --> 00:03:08.590 
attachment on it it actually it's to
more<00:03:05.840> mobility<00:03:06.290> than<00:03:07.040> the<00:03:07.190> ak-12<00:03:07.640> r.i.p<00:03:08.090> and

00:03:08.590 --> 00:03:08.600 
more mobility than the ak-12 r.i.p and

00:03:08.600 --> 00:03:11.110 
more mobility than the ak-12 r.i.p and
the<00:03:09.500> thing<00:03:09.709> that<00:03:09.739> really<00:03:09.890> makes<00:03:10.430> it<00:03:10.670> better<00:03:10.820> in

00:03:11.110 --> 00:03:11.120 
the thing that really makes it better in

00:03:11.120 --> 00:03:14.920 
the thing that really makes it better in
my<00:03:11.480> opinion<00:03:11.630> is<00:03:12.140> it<00:03:12.320> doesn't<00:03:12.590> have<00:03:12.800> any<00:03:13.930> -

00:03:14.920 --> 00:03:14.930 
my opinion is it doesn't have any -

00:03:14.930 --> 00:03:16.390 
my opinion is it doesn't have any -
ammunition<00:03:15.530> on<00:03:15.620> it<00:03:15.739> or<00:03:15.830> anything<00:03:16.100> like<00:03:16.340> that

00:03:16.390 --> 00:03:16.400 
ammunition on it or anything like that

00:03:16.400 --> 00:03:17.560 
ammunition on it or anything like that
so<00:03:16.610> you<00:03:16.670> can<00:03:16.700> have<00:03:16.790> all<00:03:16.970> 30<00:03:17.150> bullets<00:03:17.420> in<00:03:17.480> your

00:03:17.560 --> 00:03:17.570 
so you can have all 30 bullets in your

00:03:17.570 --> 00:03:19.300 
so you can have all 30 bullets in your
clip<00:03:17.750> even<00:03:17.900> 45<00:03:18.590> if<00:03:18.769> you<00:03:18.860> decide<00:03:19.130> to<00:03:19.220> put

00:03:19.300 --> 00:03:19.310 
clip even 45 if you decide to put

00:03:19.310 --> 00:03:21.190 
clip even 45 if you decide to put
extended<00:03:19.670> mags<00:03:19.850> on<00:03:19.970> it<00:03:20.090> so<00:03:20.510> that<00:03:20.720> alone<00:03:21.140> I

00:03:21.190 --> 00:03:21.200 
extended mags on it so that alone I

00:03:21.200 --> 00:03:22.840 
extended mags on it so that alone I
think<00:03:21.560> is<00:03:21.650> what<00:03:21.799> sets<00:03:22.040> this<00:03:22.160> gun<00:03:22.340> apart<00:03:22.670> and

00:03:22.840 --> 00:03:22.850 
think is what sets this gun apart and

00:03:22.850 --> 00:03:24.280 
think is what sets this gun apart and
makes<00:03:22.970> it<00:03:23.090> even<00:03:23.180> better<00:03:23.450> make<00:03:23.690> the<00:03:23.810> makes<00:03:24.140> the

00:03:24.280 --> 00:03:24.290 
makes it even better make the makes the

00:03:24.290 --> 00:03:26.710 
makes it even better make the makes the
ak-12<00:03:24.620> rip<00:03:24.890> not<00:03:25.519> too<00:03:26.090> good<00:03:26.239> of<00:03:26.360> a<00:03:26.420> weapon

00:03:26.710 --> 00:03:26.720 
ak-12 rip not too good of a weapon

00:03:26.720 --> 00:03:28.030 
ak-12 rip not too good of a weapon
because<00:03:26.870> even<00:03:27.080> with<00:03:27.200> extended<00:03:27.620> mags<00:03:27.650> on<00:03:27.890> the<00:03:27.920> a

00:03:28.030 --> 00:03:28.040 
because even with extended mags on the a

00:03:28.040 --> 00:03:29.770 
because even with extended mags on the a
ketover<00:03:28.370> if<00:03:28.519> you<00:03:28.580> only<00:03:28.700> get<00:03:28.880> 33<00:03:29.330> bullets<00:03:29.630> which

00:03:29.770 --> 00:03:29.780 
ketover if you only get 33 bullets which

00:03:29.780 --> 00:03:32.170 
ketover if you only get 33 bullets which
is<00:03:29.930> still<00:03:30.200> hurting<00:03:30.980> you<00:03:31.010> a<00:03:31.250> lot<00:03:31.519> so<00:03:31.700> the<00:03:31.790> ak-12

00:03:32.170 --> 00:03:32.180 
is still hurting you a lot so the ak-12

00:03:32.180 --> 00:03:34.570 
is still hurting you a lot so the ak-12
G<00:03:32.480> is<00:03:32.600> definitely<00:03:33.200> definitely<00:03:33.590> a<00:03:34.070> good<00:03:34.370> option

00:03:34.570 --> 00:03:34.580 
G is definitely definitely a good option

00:03:34.580 --> 00:03:36.820 
G is definitely definitely a good option
and<00:03:35.180> it's<00:03:35.360> a<00:03:35.420> good<00:03:35.600> alternative<00:03:35.750> if<00:03:36.440> you<00:03:36.650> can't

00:03:36.820 --> 00:03:36.830

00:03:36.830 --> 00:03:39.039 
and it's a good alternative if you can't
get<00:03:36.950> the<00:03:37.040> ak-12<00:03:37.519> rip<00:03:38.000> in<00:03:38.209> a<00:03:38.360> Supply<00:03:38.630> Drop<00:03:38.690> and
