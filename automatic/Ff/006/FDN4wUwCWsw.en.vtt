so this is pretty cool and I did nothing
I<00:02:08.099> mean<00:02:08.220> this<00:02:08.580> is<00:02:08.729> just<00:02:08.759> the<00:02:09.090> first<00:02:09.330> step<00:02:09.660> on

00:02:09.889 --> 00:02:09.899 
I mean this is just the first step on

00:02:09.899 --> 00:02:13.070 
I mean this is just the first step on
what<00:02:10.170> you<00:02:10.349> were<00:02:10.470> allowed<00:02:10.920> to<00:02:10.979> do<00:02:11.430> as<00:02:11.670> far<00:02:12.270> as

00:02:13.070 --> 00:02:13.080 
what you were allowed to do as far as

00:02:13.080 --> 00:02:16.340 
what you were allowed to do as far as
the<00:02:13.230> game<00:02:13.470> looks<00:02:14.060> I<00:02:15.060> mean<00:02:15.570> there's<00:02:15.750> all<00:02:15.960> sorts

00:02:16.340 --> 00:02:16.350 
the game looks I mean there's all sorts

00:02:16.350 --> 00:02:19.280 
the game looks I mean there's all sorts
of<00:02:16.470> shadowing<00:02:17.040> and<00:02:17.580> all<00:02:18.510> that<00:02:19.020> other<00:02:19.200> stuff

00:02:19.280 --> 00:02:19.290 
of shadowing and all that other stuff

00:02:19.290 --> 00:02:20.720 
of shadowing and all that other stuff
that<00:02:19.620> you<00:02:19.710> can<00:02:19.860> actually<00:02:19.980> do<00:02:20.310> with<00:02:20.490> it<00:02:20.610> but

00:02:20.720 --> 00:02:20.730 
that you can actually do with it but

00:02:20.730 --> 00:02:22.430 
that you can actually do with it but
here's<00:02:20.940> just<00:02:21.000> a<00:02:21.270> quick<00:02:21.510> tile<00:02:21.900> set<00:02:22.230> that<00:02:22.410> I

00:02:22.430 --> 00:02:22.440 
here's just a quick tile set that I

00:02:22.440 --> 00:02:24.650 
here's just a quick tile set that I
threw<00:02:22.650> together<00:02:22.740> and<00:02:23.300> alright<00:02:24.300> put<00:02:24.540> together

00:02:24.650 --> 00:02:24.660
