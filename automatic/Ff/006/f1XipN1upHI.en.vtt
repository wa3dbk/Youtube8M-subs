00:01:50.880 --> 00:01:50.890 
into a key and it's all modulating

00:01:50.890 --> 00:01:53.520 
into a key and it's all modulating
within<00:01:51.220> the<00:01:51.490> run<00:01:51.910> that<00:01:52.180> we're<00:01:52.330> playing<00:01:52.540> yeah

00:01:53.520 --> 00:01:53.530

00:01:53.530 --> 00:01:55.980 
within the run that we're playing yeah
so<00:01:53.740> we're<00:01:53.890> changing<00:01:54.100> keys<00:01:54.520> maybe<00:01:55.000> maybe<00:01:55.720> not

00:01:55.980 --> 00:01:55.990 
so we're changing keys maybe maybe not

00:01:55.990 --> 00:01:58.620 
so we're changing keys maybe maybe not
and<00:01:56.460> we're<00:01:57.460> changing<00:01:57.790> feels<00:01:58.090> and<00:01:58.420> then<00:01:58.509> we're

00:01:58.620 --> 00:01:58.630 
and we're changing feels and then we're

00:01:58.630 --> 00:02:00.660 
and we're changing feels and then we're
changing<00:01:58.960> tempo<00:01:59.320> and<00:01:59.979> it's<00:02:00.130> all<00:02:00.280> just<00:02:00.520> like

00:02:00.660 --> 00:02:00.670 
changing tempo and it's all just like

00:02:00.670 --> 00:02:03.120 
changing tempo and it's all just like
sort<00:02:00.910> of<00:02:01.000> tricky<00:02:01.330> massaging<00:02:02.080> of<00:02:02.200> the<00:02:02.380> music<00:02:02.740> so

00:02:03.120 --> 00:02:03.130 
sort of tricky massaging of the music so

00:02:03.130 --> 00:02:05.400 
sort of tricky massaging of the music so
so<00:02:03.429> it<00:02:03.520> doesn't<00:02:03.789> sound<00:02:03.970> abrupt<00:02:04.569> or<00:02:04.929> it<00:02:05.080> doesn't

00:02:05.400 --> 00:02:05.410 
so it doesn't sound abrupt or it doesn't

00:02:05.410 --> 00:02:09.120 
so it doesn't sound abrupt or it doesn't
sound<00:02:05.670> unnatural<00:02:06.670> or<00:02:07.450> image<00:02:07.750> or<00:02:07.929> you<00:02:08.560> know<00:02:08.679> you
