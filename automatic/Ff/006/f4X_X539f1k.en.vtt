welcome to IFES technical
today<00:00:07.230> we're<00:00:07.350> going<00:00:07.470> to<00:00:07.529> be<00:00:07.620> timely<00:00:08.010> Snell<00:00:08.400> not

today we're going to be timely Snell not
and<00:00:08.940> the<00:00:09.660> smell<00:00:09.960> knot<00:00:10.170> is<00:00:10.469> a<00:00:11.370> knot<00:00:11.759> to<00:00:12.090> tie<00:00:12.780> a

00:00:12.799 --> 00:00:12.809 
and the smell knot is a knot to tie a

00:00:12.809 --> 00:00:15.550 
and the smell knot is a knot to tie a
leader<00:00:13.200> directly<00:00:13.740> into<00:00:14.099> the<00:00:14.280> hook<00:00:14.490> and

00:00:15.550 --> 00:00:15.560 
leader directly into the hook and

00:00:15.560 --> 00:00:18.140 
leader directly into the hook and
instead<00:00:16.560> of<00:00:16.710> using<00:00:16.890> what<00:00:17.580> we<00:00:17.670> came<00:00:17.850> up<00:00:17.910> with

00:00:18.140 --> 00:00:18.150 
instead of using what we came up with

00:00:18.150 --> 00:00:21.200 
instead of using what we came up with
last<00:00:18.330> time<00:00:18.800> we<00:00:19.800> decided<00:00:20.250> to<00:00:20.340> go<00:00:20.490> with<00:00:20.730> this

00:00:21.200 --> 00:00:21.210 
last time we decided to go with this

00:00:21.210 --> 00:00:24.920 
last time we decided to go with this
large<00:00:21.869> treble<00:00:22.380> hook<00:00:22.560> which<00:00:23.070> we<00:00:23.250> just<00:00:23.930> snipped

00:00:24.920 --> 00:00:24.930 
large treble hook which we just snipped

00:00:24.930 --> 00:00:26.689 
large treble hook which we just snipped
off<00:00:25.050> the<00:00:25.260> other<00:00:25.380> two<00:00:25.590> ends<00:00:25.890> on<00:00:25.980> so<00:00:26.460> there's

00:00:26.689 --> 00:00:26.699 
off the other two ends on so there's

00:00:26.699 --> 00:00:28.040 
off the other two ends on so there's
only<00:00:26.760> thing<00:00:27.029> that<00:00:27.180> we<00:00:27.269> saw<00:00:27.480> with<00:00:27.720> the<00:00:27.869> big

00:00:28.040 --> 00:00:28.050 
only thing that we saw with the big

00:00:28.050 --> 00:00:30.560 
only thing that we saw with the big
enough<00:00:28.260> I<00:00:28.500> to<00:00:28.560> feed<00:00:29.519> paracord<00:00:30.119> through<00:00:30.420> to

00:00:30.560 --> 00:00:30.570 
enough I to feed paracord through to

00:00:30.570 --> 00:00:32.749 
enough I to feed paracord through to
show<00:00:30.750> this<00:00:30.900> a<00:00:31.050> little<00:00:31.140> easier<00:00:31.619> than<00:00:31.830> tying

00:00:32.749 --> 00:00:32.759 
show this a little easier than tying

00:00:32.759 --> 00:00:35.690 
show this a little easier than tying
with<00:00:32.969> fishing<00:00:33.329> string<00:00:33.630> so<00:00:34.430> without<00:00:35.430> further

00:00:35.690 --> 00:00:35.700 
with fishing string so without further

00:00:35.700 --> 00:00:38.630 
with fishing string so without further
ado<00:00:36.149> here's<00:00:36.809> the<00:00:37.110> snow<00:00:37.320> not<00:00:37.559> so<00:00:38.489> when<00:00:38.610> you

00:00:38.630 --> 00:00:38.640 
ado here's the snow not so when you

00:00:38.640 --> 00:00:41.119 
ado here's the snow not so when you
start<00:00:38.969> the<00:00:39.059> snow<00:00:39.120> not<00:00:39.590> you're<00:00:40.590> going<00:00:40.739> to<00:00:40.829> start

00:00:41.119 --> 00:00:41.129 
start the snow not you're going to start

00:00:41.129 --> 00:00:45.619 
start the snow not you're going to start
coming<00:00:42.059> through<00:00:42.180> the<00:00:42.629> hook<00:00:42.930> side<00:00:43.200> of<00:00:44.600> the<00:00:45.600> eye

00:00:45.619 --> 00:00:45.629 
coming through the hook side of the eye

00:00:45.629 --> 00:00:49.580 
coming through the hook side of the eye
and<00:00:47.059> making<00:00:48.059> a<00:00:48.210> big<00:00:48.390> loop<00:00:48.660> so<00:00:49.140> let<00:00:49.260> me<00:00:49.320> flip

00:00:49.580 --> 00:00:49.590 
and making a big loop so let me flip

00:00:49.590 --> 00:00:51.770 
and making a big loop so let me flip
this<00:00:49.739> around<00:00:49.890> so<00:00:50.160> you<00:00:50.219> can<00:00:50.370> see<00:00:50.520> this<00:00:50.780> so

00:00:51.770 --> 00:00:51.780 
this around so you can see this so

00:00:51.780 --> 00:00:54.860 
this around so you can see this so
you're<00:00:51.870> going<00:00:51.989> to<00:00:52.020> make<00:00:52.170> your<00:00:52.320> loop<00:00:52.500> and<00:00:53.870> the

00:00:54.860 --> 00:00:54.870 
you're going to make your loop and the

00:00:54.870 --> 00:00:56.270 
you're going to make your loop and the
loop<00:00:54.899> that<00:00:55.199> you<00:00:55.260> make<00:00:55.500> is<00:00:55.710> going<00:00:55.949> to<00:00:56.010> cross

00:00:56.270 --> 00:00:56.280 
loop that you make is going to cross

00:00:56.280 --> 00:01:01.160 
loop that you make is going to cross
over<00:00:57.469> the<00:00:58.469> standing<00:00:58.980> part<00:00:59.480> just<00:01:00.480> like<00:01:00.690> so<00:01:00.899> and

00:01:01.160 --> 00:01:01.170 
over the standing part just like so and

00:01:01.170 --> 00:01:03.349 
over the standing part just like so and
what<00:01:01.980> you're<00:01:02.070> going<00:01:02.219> to<00:01:02.250> do<00:01:02.460> is<00:01:03.059> you're<00:01:03.270> going

00:01:03.349 --> 00:01:03.359 
what you're going to do is you're going

00:01:03.359 --> 00:01:08.300 
what you're going to do is you're going
to<00:01:03.420> wrap<00:01:04.460> inside<00:01:05.460> of<00:01:05.610> this<00:01:05.729> loop<00:01:07.159> with<00:01:08.159> the

00:01:08.300 --> 00:01:08.310 
to wrap inside of this loop with the

00:01:08.310 --> 00:01:12.920 
to wrap inside of this loop with the
working<00:01:08.610> in<00:01:10.820> so<00:01:11.820> I'm<00:01:12.150> gonna<00:01:12.270> wrap<00:01:12.450> this<00:01:12.600> about

00:01:12.920 --> 00:01:12.930 
working in so I'm gonna wrap this about

00:01:12.930 --> 00:01:15.710 
working in so I'm gonna wrap this about
four<00:01:13.290> or<00:01:13.380> five<00:01:13.530> times<00:01:13.770> here<00:01:14.420> however<00:01:15.420> many<00:01:15.630> I

00:01:15.710 --> 00:01:15.720 
four or five times here however many I

00:01:15.720 --> 00:01:19.010 
four or five times here however many I
can<00:01:15.990> get<00:01:16.170> out<00:01:16.290> of<00:01:16.320> here<00:01:17.509> and<00:01:18.509> the<00:01:18.720> amount<00:01:18.960> of

00:01:19.010 --> 00:01:19.020 
can get out of here and the amount of

00:01:19.020 --> 00:01:28.149 
can get out of here and the amount of
wraps<00:01:19.200> isn't<00:01:19.619> really<00:01:21.979> specifics

00:01:28.149 --> 00:01:28.159 

00:01:28.159 --> 00:01:31.060 

so<00:01:28.820> once<00:01:29.000> you<00:01:29.119> have<00:01:29.240> your<00:01:29.329> raps<00:01:29.920> what<00:01:30.920> you're

00:01:31.060 --> 00:01:31.070 
so once you have your raps what you're

00:01:31.070 --> 00:01:33.990 
so once you have your raps what you're
going<00:01:31.219> to<00:01:31.250> do<00:01:31.780> is<00:01:32.780> you're<00:01:32.990> going<00:01:33.049> to<00:01:33.200> pull<00:01:33.439> the

00:01:33.990 --> 00:01:34.000 
going to do is you're going to pull the

00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:37.870 
going to do is you're going to pull the
working<00:01:35.000> end<00:01:35.470> at<00:01:36.470> the<00:01:36.560> same<00:01:36.829> time<00:01:37.100> you<00:01:37.670> pull

00:01:37.870 --> 00:01:37.880 
working end at the same time you pull

00:01:37.880 --> 00:01:41.499 
working end at the same time you pull
the<00:01:38.000> stand<00:01:38.210> in<00:01:38.860> and<00:01:39.860> the<00:01:40.759> knot<00:01:40.939> is<00:01:40.970> just<00:01:41.360> going

00:01:41.499 --> 00:01:41.509 
the stand in and the knot is just going

00:01:41.509 --> 00:01:51.630 
the stand in and the knot is just going
to<00:01:41.600> tighten<00:01:44.560> if<00:01:45.560> I<00:01:45.740> can<00:01:45.890> do<00:01:46.009> this<00:01:46.130> right<00:01:46.369> here

00:01:51.630 --> 00:01:51.640 

00:01:51.640 --> 00:01:58.000 

area

00:01:58.000 --> 00:01:58.010 

00:01:58.010 --> 00:02:00.190 

so<00:01:58.580> once<00:01:58.730> your<00:01:58.880> knot<00:01:59.030> is<00:01:59.060> tightened<00:01:59.420> it's<00:01:59.990> a

00:02:00.190 --> 00:02:00.200 
so once your knot is tightened it's a

00:02:00.200 --> 00:02:03.600 
so once your knot is tightened it's a
little<00:02:00.830> more<00:02:01.100> difficult<00:02:01.520> with<00:02:01.610> paracord<00:02:02.030> here

00:02:03.600 --> 00:02:03.610 
little more difficult with paracord here

00:02:03.610 --> 00:02:05.680 
little more difficult with paracord here
I'm<00:02:04.610> just<00:02:04.790> going<00:02:04.940> to<00:02:04.970> clean<00:02:05.180> this<00:02:05.300> up<00:02:05.360> a<00:02:05.570> little

00:02:05.680 --> 00:02:05.690 
I'm just going to clean this up a little

00:02:05.690 --> 00:02:14.470 
I'm just going to clean this up a little
bit<00:02:07.750> tighten<00:02:08.750> it<00:02:08.840> up<00:02:13.090> so<00:02:14.090> the<00:02:14.210> finished

00:02:14.470 --> 00:02:14.480 
bit tighten it up so the finished

00:02:14.480 --> 00:02:16.650 
bit tighten it up so the finished
product<00:02:14.870> looks<00:02:15.470> something<00:02:15.680> like<00:02:15.830> this

00:02:16.650 --> 00:02:16.660 
product looks something like this

00:02:16.660 --> 00:02:22.180 
product looks something like this
and<00:02:17.660> the<00:02:18.470> backside<00:02:20.650> it's<00:02:21.650> kind<00:02:21.830> of<00:02:21.860> just<00:02:22.010> a

00:02:22.180 --> 00:02:22.190 
and the backside it's kind of just a

00:02:22.190 --> 00:02:23.800 
and the backside it's kind of just a
friction<00:02:22.640> not<00:02:22.790> really<00:02:23.150> because<00:02:23.330> it's<00:02:23.600> just

00:02:23.800 --> 00:02:23.810 
friction not really because it's just

00:02:23.810 --> 00:02:27.310 
friction not really because it's just
holding<00:02:25.150> the<00:02:26.150> tension<00:02:26.540> that<00:02:26.660> you're<00:02:26.870> pulling

00:02:27.310 --> 00:02:27.320 
holding the tension that you're pulling

00:02:27.320 --> 00:02:29.290 
holding the tension that you're pulling
on<00:02:27.500> the<00:02:27.800> hook<00:02:27.980> is<00:02:28.190> really<00:02:28.460> what's<00:02:28.850> holding<00:02:29.180> the

00:02:29.290 --> 00:02:29.300 
on the hook is really what's holding the

00:02:29.300 --> 00:02:32.350 
on the hook is really what's holding the
knot<00:02:29.450> together<00:02:30.430> but<00:02:31.430> this<00:02:31.610> does<00:02:31.850> create<00:02:32.240> an

00:02:32.350 --> 00:02:32.360 
knot together but this does create an

00:02:32.360 --> 00:02:34.780 
knot together but this does create an
even<00:02:32.660> straight-line<00:02:33.230> pole<00:02:33.500> which<00:02:34.310> is<00:02:34.490> great

00:02:34.780 --> 00:02:34.790 
even straight-line pole which is great

00:02:34.790 --> 00:02:38.110 
even straight-line pole which is great
for<00:02:35.210> a<00:02:35.270> fishing<00:02:35.480> hook<00:02:36.310> so<00:02:37.310> let<00:02:37.670> me<00:02:37.730> try<00:02:37.880> to<00:02:37.910> show

00:02:38.110 --> 00:02:38.120 
for a fishing hook so let me try to show

00:02:38.120 --> 00:02:39.760 
for a fishing hook so let me try to show
that<00:02:38.150> one<00:02:38.420> more<00:02:38.570> time<00:02:38.600> because<00:02:38.810> I'm<00:02:39.290> not<00:02:39.560> sure

00:02:39.760 --> 00:02:39.770 
that one more time because I'm not sure
