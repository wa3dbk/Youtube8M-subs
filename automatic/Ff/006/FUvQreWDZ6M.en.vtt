00:00:00.250 --> 00:00:05.080
 People I wanna do this video is 

00:00:03.610 --> 00:00:08.530
 to show you the disappointment that I 

00:00:05.080 --> 00:00:10.410
 I'm with this atv smart 3d television 

00:00:08.530 --> 00:00:13.179
 samsung 

00:00:10.410 --> 00:00:15.910
 apparently a great product 

00:00:13.179 --> 00:00:22.350
 quality on television with the resources 

00:00:15.910 --> 00:00:27.369
 current and not as 3d smart tv with 

00:00:22.350 --> 00:00:30.519
 technology, the user is for me 

00:00:27.369 --> 00:00:35.469
 lack lately lacked nothing missing 

00:00:30.519 --> 00:00:39.340
 linked to quality is the brand that best 

00:00:35.469 --> 00:00:42.579
 model is a f60 and 400 on tv 40 

00:00:39.340 --> 00:00:44.739
 inches where showing this defect 

00:00:42.579 --> 00:00:47.890
 that several other television 

00:00:44.739 --> 00:00:51.520
 samsung is also mounting a defect 

00:00:47.890 --> 00:00:53.739
 to turn on and off without stopping 

00:00:51.520 --> 00:00:56.469
 Note that in this little corner here it is so 

00:00:53.739 --> 00:00:58.000
 quick that we can not even do 

00:00:56.469 --> 00:01:00.039
 connected television 

00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:02.590
 Notice that the control in my hand 

00:01:00.039 --> 00:01:07.270
 because the television playing by calling and 

00:01:02.590 --> 00:01:10.869
 Turning off comes to worst of all 

00:01:07.270 --> 00:01:13.720
 samsung is not even there I bought at the time 

00:01:10.869 --> 00:01:15.820
 because the samsung notebook one of the 

00:01:13.720 --> 00:01:18.700
 best not currently know to others 

00:01:15.820 --> 00:01:20.350
 more like dell and hp Sony VAIO and the 

00:01:18.700 --> 00:01:22.570
 several others but also very good 

00:01:20.350 --> 00:01:24.670
 on samsung phones also 

00:01:22.570 --> 00:01:26.409
 a company that only has the 

00:01:24.670 --> 00:01:28.000
 growing in the market is growing every 

00:01:26.409 --> 00:01:31.150
 more time putting excellent products 

00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:35.770
 in the market accompanied beautiful television 

00:01:31.150 --> 00:01:39.490
 excellent image quality but with 

00:01:35.770 --> 00:01:43.149
 this problem and just two months 

00:01:39.490 --> 00:01:44.799
 and a half only compensates for television already 

00:01:43.149 --> 00:01:47.049
 presenting this defect was to search 

00:01:44.799 --> 00:01:48.729
 I saw on the internet that it is a problem that 

00:01:47.049 --> 00:01:54.100
 is happening with several televisions 

00:01:48.729 --> 00:01:57.759
 samsung and the company does not admit 

00:01:54.100 --> 00:02:00.159
 in this television series completely 

00:01:57.759 --> 00:02:01.090
 in this case with an absurd case and with 

00:02:00.159 --> 00:02:03.460
 your customers 

00:02:01.090 --> 00:02:04.960
 I have already been told that in order to 

00:02:03.460 --> 00:02:06.759
 television software 

00:02:04.960 --> 00:02:08.000
 I've already been told to simply put 

00:02:06.759 --> 00:02:10.350
 only she in 

00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:12.390
 because it could be a problem of 

00:02:10.350 --> 00:02:14.280
 energy problem not as 

00:02:12.390 --> 00:02:18.800
 can see your computer is running 

00:02:14.280 --> 00:02:21.960
 fan is connected to lamp lit 

00:02:18.800 --> 00:02:25.380
 has also linked the issue of 

00:02:21.960 --> 00:02:27.570
 energy is not the only one in the socket 

00:02:25.380 --> 00:02:31.140
 I called only television is taken as can 

00:02:27.570 --> 00:02:33.630
 see the stabilizer plugged into the outlet 

00:02:31.140 --> 00:02:35.910
 television a stabilizer with you 

00:02:33.630 --> 00:02:38.640
 You can see there I've already 

00:02:35.910 --> 00:02:42.600
 in the wall socket as well and does not 

00:02:38.640 --> 00:02:44.340
 nothing remains the same problem as already 

00:02:42.600 --> 00:02:45.840
 I said, I searched the internet for various 

00:02:44.340 --> 00:02:47.940
 other people are also presenting 

00:02:45.840 --> 00:02:49.530
 the same problem 

00:02:47.940 --> 00:02:51.570
 My luck is that it was only two 

00:02:49.530 --> 00:02:53.850
 months and a half is still under warranty 

00:02:51.570 --> 00:02:56.850
 worst of all now is what will stay in 

00:02:53.850 --> 00:02:58.650
 minimum 30 days without television 

00:02:56.850 --> 00:03:00.210
 goes there for the guarantee they invent 

00:02:58.650 --> 00:03:03.870
 but I do not know how many excuses to 

00:03:00.210 --> 00:03:06.060
 to be able to solve in case 

00:03:03.870 --> 00:03:10.680
 My problem is sharing this. 

00:03:06.060 --> 00:03:17.760
 video guys because a great brand though 

00:03:10.680 --> 00:03:18.900
 this company nor is there doing 

00:03:17.760 --> 00:03:21.150
 minimum 

00:03:18.900 --> 00:03:23.970
 this is very disappointing is a brand 

00:03:21.150 --> 00:03:27.209
 who had complete confidence that now 

00:03:23.970 --> 00:03:28.170
 simply leaving much to the 

00:03:27.209 --> 00:03:31.410
 Wish 

00:03:28.170 --> 00:03:33.540
 no more turning it off now than the nervousness 

00:03:31.410 --> 00:03:38.880
 It's already so high that the work is going to 

00:03:33.540 --> 00:03:40.140
 words here that is not necessary in this 

00:03:38.880 --> 00:03:42.750
 in this type of video 

00:03:40.140 --> 00:03:44.400
 this kind of situation completely 

00:03:42.750 --> 00:03:45.870
 indignant at this mark as soon as 

00:03:44.400 --> 00:03:47.820
 get the problem solved back 

00:03:45.870 --> 00:03:50.130
 in this same place and water and vice 

00:03:47.820 --> 00:03:52.410
 able to solve who has also 

00:03:50.130 --> 00:03:56.430
 this problem with some product favor 

00:03:52.410 --> 00:03:57.420
 tell sharing if you can 

00:03:56.430 --> 00:04:00.620
 solve 

00:03:57.420 --> 00:04:00.620
 I think I said that.
