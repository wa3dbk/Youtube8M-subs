00:00:23.279 --> 00:00:27.039
 we still do not know why but of ours and then a lot will change 

00:00:27.039 --> 00:00:31.400
 The crowd favorites were those who marry Ayda Field from Russian stars 

00:00:31.399 --> 00:00:32.270
 League 

00:00:32.270 --> 00:00:36.970
 whose popularity exceeds those of Fielmann over Moscow or liquidated 

00:00:37.670 --> 00:00:40.400
 whoever said these words must be beaten 

00:00:40.400 --> 00:00:45.020
 but who wants to know where all good what you do in such a case si so 

00:00:45.020 --> 00:00:48.020
 we are probably choking today 2 

00:00:48.840 --> 00:00:52.150
 how does Jacobi go in our body he mentions 

00:00:52.150 --> 00:00:54.450
 not just a shish kebab 

00:00:54.450 --> 00:00:56.940
 and that is how our viewers experience today 

00:00:56.940 --> 00:00:59.820
 further preparation methods 

00:00:59.820 --> 00:01:02.820
 here first a variant for care4 fans 

00:01:03.340 --> 00:01:09.030
 gear4 is also popular in Russia and a breeze is also suitable 

00:01:09.030 --> 00:01:10.920
 for lean meat 

00:01:10.920 --> 00:01:14.990
 one stacks alternately peppered and salted hard-working 

00:01:14.990 --> 00:01:17.370
 apples and onions he went in a pot 

00:01:17.370 --> 00:01:19.830
 and he adds to g4 

00:01:19.830 --> 00:01:22.430
 until everything is completely covered he is 

00:01:22.430 --> 00:01:27.500
 Andritz dragonflies and about one liter of KIFIR are included in one of these meat dishes 

00:01:28.590 --> 00:01:31.590
 also enough people like Uli Carlo can do this 

00:01:32.410 --> 00:01:35.790
 the whole thing will be more than ever the night and the next day the 

00:01:35.790 --> 00:01:38.790
 Skewers chose their successes 

00:01:39.570 --> 00:01:42.910
 now also a version for all their fans 

00:01:42.910 --> 00:01:47.810
 because even with the barley juice, a recipe is known in Eastern Europe 

00:01:48.660 --> 00:01:53.330
 the ember preparation is equal everyone needs first well-grown meat 

00:01:54.380 --> 00:01:59.270
 next to onion, here he praises garlic cloves under Holger 

00:01:59.270 --> 00:02:01.000
 Added 

00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:06.400
 and then stuffed with beer is best not to offer the stock 

00:02:08.159 --> 00:02:12.560
 like these two, we still know Kaliningrad and Kamchatka 

00:02:12.559 --> 00:02:16.179
 numerous other sweepstakes preparation methods 

00:02:16.179 --> 00:02:21.279
 Our favorite is the classic but worth reading due to food 

00:02:21.279 --> 00:02:24.279
 you have found your own favorite variant 

00:02:24.909 --> 00:02:27.909
 like the Admira critics 

00:02:29.419 --> 00:02:32.649
 I think no 

00:02:32.649 --> 00:02:35.959
 there are 

00:02:35.959 --> 00:02:37.309
 the 1 

00:02:37.309 --> 00:02:38.749
 finances 

00:02:38.749 --> 00:02:39.599
 the judge
