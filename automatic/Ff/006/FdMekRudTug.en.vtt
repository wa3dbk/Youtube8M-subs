00:02:52.770 --> 00:02:52.780 
we will add all the staff but as I said

00:02:52.780 --> 00:02:54.780 
we will add all the staff but as I said
earlier<00:02:52.930> this<00:02:53.320> is<00:02:53.380> really<00:02:53.740> just<00:02:53.770> a<00:02:54.130> time<00:02:54.370> to

00:02:54.780 --> 00:02:54.790 
earlier this is really just a time to

00:02:54.790 --> 00:02:57.270 
earlier this is really just a time to
experiment<00:02:55.390> into<00:02:55.510> tests<00:02:55.900> and<00:02:56.740> so<00:02:56.980> we<00:02:57.130> can

00:02:57.270 --> 00:02:57.280 
experiment into tests and so we can

00:02:57.280 --> 00:02:59.910 
experiment into tests and so we can
judge<00:02:57.520> exactly<00:02:57.910> how<00:02:58.390> Eddie<00:02:58.780> can<00:02:59.530> use<00:02:59.800> this

00:02:59.910 --> 00:02:59.920 
judge exactly how Eddie can use this

00:02:59.920 --> 00:03:03.060 
judge exactly how Eddie can use this
piece<00:03:00.160> of<00:03:00.340> software<00:03:01.170> okay<00:03:02.170> so<00:03:02.590> after<00:03:02.800> he's

00:03:03.060 --> 00:03:03.070 
piece of software okay so after he's

00:03:03.070 --> 00:03:04.460 
piece of software okay so after he's
selected

00:03:04.460 --> 00:03:04.470 
selected

00:03:04.470 --> 00:03:08.100

maybe<00:03:05.470> a<00:03:05.590> person<00:03:06.120> touch<00:03:07.120> the<00:03:07.330> HOME<00:03:07.510> key<00:03:07.540> again

00:03:08.100 --> 00:03:08.110 
maybe a person touch the HOME key again

00:03:08.110 --> 00:03:10.530 
maybe a person touch the HOME key again
and<00:03:08.520> then<00:03:09.520> let's<00:03:09.700> quickly<00:03:09.940> have<00:03:10.060> a<00:03:10.240> look<00:03:10.450> at
