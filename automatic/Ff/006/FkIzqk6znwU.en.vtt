00:02:01.569 --> 00:02:01.579 
certainly times for each person to step

00:02:01.579 --> 00:02:03.190

our upperclassmen are setting and then

00:02:04.729 --> 00:02:07.029

00:02:09.559 --> 00:02:09.569 
such a big role

00:02:09.569 --> 00:02:12.199 
such a big role

00:02:12.199 --> 00:02:12.209 
that they're displaying it to so this is

00:02:12.209 --> 00:02:15.289 
that they're displaying it to so this is
a<00:02:12.390> this<00:02:12.810> is<00:02:12.870> a<00:02:12.989> highly<00:02:13.709> functioning<00:02:14.219> group<00:02:14.459> you

00:02:15.289 --> 00:02:15.299 
a this is a highly functioning group you

00:02:15.299 --> 00:02:17.989 
a this is a highly functioning group you
know<00:02:15.420> these<00:02:15.599> are<00:02:15.810> mature<00:02:16.469> 18<00:02:17.069> through<00:02:17.370> 22<00:02:17.670> year

00:02:17.989 --> 00:02:17.999 
know these are mature 18 through 22 year

00:02:17.999 --> 00:02:20.899 
know these are mature 18 through 22 year
olds<00:02:18.269> that's<00:02:19.230> that's<00:02:19.560> what<00:02:19.859> is<00:02:20.340> attracted

00:02:20.899 --> 00:02:20.909 
olds that's that's what is attracted

00:02:20.909 --> 00:02:22.369 
olds that's that's what is attracted
Oregon<00:02:21.239> State<00:02:21.480> and<00:02:21.510> our<00:02:21.629> program<00:02:22.079> I<00:02:22.109> believe

00:02:22.369 --> 00:02:22.379 
Oregon State and our program I believe

00:02:22.379 --> 00:02:24.440 
Oregon State and our program I believe
and<00:02:22.709> that's<00:02:22.829> what<00:02:22.950> we<00:02:23.040> have<00:02:23.219> now<00:02:23.459> and<00:02:23.700> and<00:02:23.879> so<00:02:24.420> I

00:02:24.440 --> 00:02:24.450 
and that's what we have now and and so I

00:02:24.450 --> 00:02:26.209 
and that's what we have now and and so I
think<00:02:24.780> leadership<00:02:25.079> is<00:02:25.290> coming<00:02:25.799> from<00:02:25.889> a<00:02:26.040> lot<00:02:26.189> of

00:02:26.209 --> 00:02:26.219 
think leadership is coming from a lot of

00:02:26.219 --> 00:02:28.849 
think leadership is coming from a lot of
places<00:02:26.400> but<00:02:26.969> you<00:02:27.930> know<00:02:28.019> you<00:02:28.079> look<00:02:28.439> at<00:02:28.560> the<00:02:28.650> top

00:02:28.849 --> 00:02:28.859 
places but you know you look at the top

00:02:28.859 --> 00:02:31.099 
places but you know you look at the top
two<00:02:29.180> certainly<00:02:30.180> I'm<00:02:30.389> trying<00:02:30.659> to<00:02:30.719> take<00:02:30.840> more<00:02:31.049> of

00:02:31.099 --> 00:02:31.109

00:04:59.890 --> 00:05:01.200 
about today if you look at the top
rebounding<00:05:00.340> teams<00:05:00.490> in<00:05:00.610> our<00:05:00.670> conference<00:05:00.730> last

00:05:01.200 --> 00:05:01.210 
rebounding teams in our conference last

00:05:01.210 --> 00:05:03.120 
rebounding teams in our conference last
year<00:05:01.450> of<00:05:01.750> the<00:05:02.050> top<00:05:02.230> five<00:05:02.440> four<00:05:02.830> of<00:05:02.920> them<00:05:03.010> went

00:05:03.120 --> 00:05:03.130 
year of the top five four of them went

00:05:03.130 --> 00:05:05.250 
year of the top five four of them went
to<00:05:03.250> the<00:05:03.340> NC<00:05:04.030> double-a<00:05:04.330> tournament<00:05:04.360> you<00:05:05.140> know

00:05:05.250 --> 00:05:05.260 
to the NC double-a tournament you know

00:05:05.260 --> 00:05:07.080 
to the NC double-a tournament you know
and<00:05:05.440> so<00:05:05.650> that's<00:05:06.250> and<00:05:06.550> that's<00:05:06.700> no<00:05:06.880> coincidence

00:05:07.080 --> 00:05:07.090 
and so that's and that's no coincidence

00:05:07.090 --> 00:05:08.610 
and so that's and that's no coincidence
that's<00:05:07.630> the<00:05:07.780> way<00:05:07.900> you<00:05:07.960> get<00:05:08.140> it<00:05:08.260> done<00:05:08.350> you<00:05:08.410> need

00:05:08.610 --> 00:05:08.620 
that's the way you get it done you need

00:05:08.620 --> 00:05:12.030 
that's the way you get it done you need
possessions<00:05:09.220> and<00:05:09.540> for<00:05:10.540> us<00:05:10.660> that<00:05:10.930> that's<00:05:11.230> the

00:05:12.030 --> 00:05:12.040 
possessions and for us that that's the

00:05:12.040 --> 00:05:15.150 
possessions and for us that that's the
matching<00:05:12.790> that<00:05:12.940> physicality<00:05:13.950> playing<00:05:14.950> at<00:05:15.130> a

00:05:15.150 --> 00:05:15.160 
matching that physicality playing at a

00:05:15.160 --> 00:05:17.090 
matching that physicality playing at a
hundred<00:05:15.430> percent<00:05:15.550> of<00:05:15.760> our<00:05:15.880> athleticism

00:05:17.090 --> 00:05:17.100 
hundred percent of our athleticism

00:05:17.100 --> 00:05:19.590 
hundred percent of our athleticism
that's<00:05:18.100> where<00:05:18.340> we<00:05:18.460> really<00:05:18.730> have<00:05:18.850> to<00:05:19.030> grow<00:05:19.330> and

00:05:19.590 --> 00:05:19.600 
that's where we really have to grow and

00:05:19.600 --> 00:05:21.000 
that's where we really have to grow and
that's<00:05:19.750> the<00:05:19.930> standard<00:05:20.110> we<00:05:20.380> have<00:05:20.530> to<00:05:20.710> play<00:05:20.860> at

00:05:21.000 --> 00:05:21.010 
that's the standard we have to play at

00:05:21.010 --> 00:05:22.740 
that's the standard we have to play at
all<00:05:21.130> the<00:05:21.250> time<00:05:21.430> and<00:05:21.669> so<00:05:21.820> rebounding<00:05:22.630> is

00:05:22.740 --> 00:05:22.750 
all the time and so rebounding is

00:05:22.750 --> 00:05:25.200 
all the time and so rebounding is
certainly<00:05:23.169> you<00:05:23.680> know<00:05:23.830> one<00:05:24.550> of<00:05:24.640> the<00:05:24.700> main<00:05:24.850> focal

00:05:25.200 --> 00:05:25.210 
certainly you know one of the main focal

00:05:25.210 --> 00:05:25.620 
certainly you know one of the main focal
points

00:05:25.620 --> 00:05:25.630 
points

00:05:25.630 --> 00:05:27.900 
points
to<00:05:25.960> start<00:05:26.200> this<00:05:26.290> year<00:05:26.550> working<00:05:27.550> a<00:05:27.610> lot<00:05:27.730> on

00:05:27.900 --> 00:05:27.910

to start this year working a lot on
rebounding<00:05:28.480> I<00:05:28.630> think<00:05:29.110> rebounding<00:05:29.500> is<00:05:29.560> a<00:05:29.620> main

00:05:29.760 --> 00:05:29.770 
rebounding I think rebounding is a main

00:05:29.770 --> 00:05:31.530 
rebounding I think rebounding is a main
goal<00:05:29.950> I<00:05:30.280> remember<00:05:30.550> coach<00:05:30.700> saying<00:05:31.030> that<00:05:31.270> in<00:05:31.450> our

00:05:31.530 --> 00:05:31.540 
goal I remember coach saying that in our

00:05:31.540 --> 00:05:34.530 
goal I remember coach saying that in our
conference<00:05:32.050> the<00:05:32.979> top<00:05:33.160> floor<00:05:33.340> rebounders<00:05:33.820> made

00:05:34.530 --> 00:05:34.540 
conference the top floor rebounders made

00:05:34.540 --> 00:05:35.909

00:05:35.909 --> 00:05:35.919 
it to the NC double-a tournament and of

00:05:35.919 --> 00:05:37.890 
it to the NC double-a tournament and of
course<00:05:36.160> that's<00:05:36.370> a<00:05:36.729> big<00:05:37.030> goal<00:05:37.240> of<00:05:37.390> ours<00:05:37.570> and<00:05:37.780> how

00:05:37.890 --> 00:05:37.900

00:05:39.090 --> 00:05:39.100 
to get postseason and I think

00:05:39.100 --> 00:05:40.620
