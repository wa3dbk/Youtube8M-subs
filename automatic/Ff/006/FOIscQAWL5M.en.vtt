00:00:19.910 --> 00:00:19.920 
step and the H is half step

00:00:19.920 --> 00:00:22.279 
step and the H is half step
now<00:00:20.279> I'm<00:00:20.400> just<00:00:20.580> gonna<00:00:20.730> cut<00:00:21.060> right<00:00:21.240> through<00:00:21.449> all

this video but this video is just gonna
teach<00:00:36.090> you<00:00:36.239> right<00:00:36.420> now<00:00:36.840> how<00:00:37.320> to<00:00:37.350> do<00:00:37.590> it<00:00:37.739> okay<00:00:38.100> so

00:00:38.959 --> 00:00:38.969 
teach you right now how to do it okay so

00:00:38.969 --> 00:00:41.209 
teach you right now how to do it okay so
the<00:00:39.090> W<00:00:39.420> is<00:00:39.629> a<00:00:39.660> whole<00:00:39.899> step<00:00:40.140> on<00:00:40.530> a<00:00:40.590> guitar<00:00:40.829> a

00:00:41.209 --> 00:00:41.219 
the W is a whole step on a guitar a

00:00:41.219 --> 00:00:43.220 
the W is a whole step on a guitar a
whole<00:00:41.460> step<00:00:41.670> is<00:00:41.879> for<00:00:42.149> example<00:00:42.270> going<00:00:42.809> from<00:00:43.050> the

00:00:43.220 --> 00:00:43.230 
whole step is for example going from the

00:00:43.230 --> 00:00:46.220 
whole step is for example going from the
third<00:00:43.860> fret<00:00:44.190> to<00:00:44.460> the<00:00:44.579> fifth<00:00:44.850> fret<00:00:45.059> a<00:00:45.390> whole

00:00:46.220 --> 00:00:46.230 
third fret to the fifth fret a whole

00:00:46.230 --> 00:00:48.139 
third fret to the fifth fret a whole
step<00:00:46.469> is<00:00:46.620> basically<00:00:46.829> you<00:00:47.489> can<00:00:47.640> think<00:00:47.820> about<00:00:47.879> it

00:00:48.139 --> 00:00:48.149 
step is basically you can think about it

00:00:48.149 --> 00:00:51.560 
step is basically you can think about it
as<00:00:48.270> jumping<00:00:49.079> a<00:00:49.170> fret<00:00:49.410> okay<00:00:49.800> so<00:00:50.760> from<00:00:51.030> third<00:00:51.360> to

00:00:51.560 --> 00:00:51.570 
as jumping a fret okay so from third to

00:00:51.570 --> 00:00:54.470 
as jumping a fret okay so from third to
fifth<00:00:51.930> that's<00:00:52.440> a<00:00:52.559> whole<00:00:52.710> step<00:00:52.980> a<00:00:53.219> half<00:00:53.910> step<00:00:54.270> is

00:00:54.470 --> 00:00:54.480 
fifth that's a whole step a half step is

00:00:54.480 --> 00:00:57.650 
fifth that's a whole step a half step is
the<00:00:55.260> next<00:00:55.620> fret<00:00:55.920> to<00:00:56.640> the<00:00:56.760> right<00:00:56.940> so<00:00:57.300> if<00:00:57.449> you<00:00:57.539> go

00:00:57.650 --> 00:00:57.660 
the next fret to the right so if you go

00:00:57.660 --> 00:01:00.610 
the next fret to the right so if you go
from<00:00:57.809> third<00:00:58.260> to<00:00:58.859> four<00:00:59.190> that's<00:01:00.059> a<00:01:00.239> half<00:01:00.420> step

00:01:00.610 --> 00:01:00.620 
from third to four that's a half step

00:01:00.620 --> 00:01:01.819 
from third to four that's a half step
okay

00:01:01.819 --> 00:01:01.829 
okay

00:01:01.829 --> 00:01:03.619 
okay
