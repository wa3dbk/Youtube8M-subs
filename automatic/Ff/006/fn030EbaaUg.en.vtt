00:00:42.920 --> 00:00:42.930 
the fan and in the back here I have a

00:00:42.930 --> 00:00:46.970 
the fan and in the back here I have a
solar<00:00:43.290> panel<00:00:43.620> and<00:00:44.130> I<00:00:44.940> use<00:00:45.210> the<00:00:45.420> solar<00:00:45.660> panel<00:00:46.200> to

00:00:46.970 --> 00:00:46.980 
solar panel and I use the solar panel to

00:00:46.980 --> 00:00:50.620 
solar panel and I use the solar panel to
charge<00:00:47.280> this<00:00:48.210> lithium<00:00:48.660> ion<00:00:49.140> battery<00:00:49.740> I

00:00:50.620 --> 00:00:50.630 
charge this lithium ion battery I

00:00:50.630 --> 00:00:54.320 
charge this lithium ion battery I
realize<00:00:51.680> for<00:00:52.680> a<00:00:52.740> lithium<00:00:53.280> ion<00:00:53.490> battery<00:00:53.670> it<00:00:54.300> is

00:00:54.320 --> 00:00:54.330 
realize for a lithium ion battery it is

00:00:54.330 --> 00:00:57.530 
realize for a lithium ion battery it is
better<00:00:54.840> to<00:00:55.110> have<00:00:55.410> a<00:00:55.620> controller<00:00:56.190> to<00:00:56.550> control

00:00:57.530 --> 00:00:57.540 
better to have a controller to control

00:00:57.540 --> 00:01:00.410 
better to have a controller to control
the<00:00:57.690> charge<00:00:57.990> because<00:00:58.350> if<00:00:58.710> you<00:00:58.800> don't<00:00:59.060> it<00:01:00.060> can

00:01:00.410 --> 00:01:00.420 
the charge because if you don't it can

00:01:00.420 --> 00:01:02.569 
the charge because if you don't it can
catch<00:01:00.960> fire<00:01:01.320> it<00:01:01.590> can<00:01:01.739> overheat<00:01:02.250> it<00:01:02.430> can

00:01:02.569 --> 00:01:02.579 
catch fire it can overheat it can

00:01:02.579 --> 00:01:05.109 
catch fire it can overheat it can
explode<00:01:03.120> it<00:01:03.660> can<00:01:03.870> do<00:01:04.019> a<00:01:04.049> lot<00:01:04.290> of<00:01:04.320> things

00:01:05.109 --> 00:01:05.119 
explode it can do a lot of things

00:01:05.119 --> 00:01:08.959 
explode it can do a lot of things
actually<00:01:06.740> it's<00:01:07.740> been<00:01:07.979> working<00:01:08.310> out<00:01:08.579> very<00:01:08.640> well

00:01:08.959 --> 00:01:08.969 
actually it's been working out very well

00:01:08.969 --> 00:01:12.559 
actually it's been working out very well
for<00:01:09.420> me<00:01:09.569> I<00:01:09.829> can<00:01:10.829> charge<00:01:11.219> this<00:01:11.670> for<00:01:11.969> about<00:01:12.090> two

00:01:12.559 --> 00:01:12.569 
for me I can charge this for about two

00:01:12.569 --> 00:01:16.550 
for me I can charge this for about two
hours<00:01:12.600> or<00:01:13.530> so<00:01:13.920> and<00:01:14.630> I<00:01:15.630> get<00:01:15.840> to<00:01:16.020> about<00:01:16.289> four

00:01:16.550 --> 00:01:16.560 
hours or so and I get to about four

00:01:16.560 --> 00:01:19.999 
hours or so and I get to about four
point<00:01:16.829> two<00:01:17.100> volt<00:01:17.490> and<00:01:17.719> then<00:01:18.719> I<00:01:19.170> would<00:01:19.469> stop<00:01:19.829> the

00:01:19.999 --> 00:01:20.009 
point two volt and then I would stop the

00:01:20.009 --> 00:01:23.539 
point two volt and then I would stop the
charging<00:01:20.600> manually<00:01:21.600> but<00:01:22.499> if<00:01:22.679> you<00:01:22.889> want<00:01:23.159> to<00:01:23.340> do

00:01:23.539 --> 00:01:23.549 
charging manually but if you want to do

00:01:23.549 --> 00:01:26.300 
charging manually but if you want to do
it<00:01:23.670> right<00:01:24.030> you<00:01:25.020> would<00:01:25.200> need<00:01:25.350> a<00:01:25.649> controller

00:01:26.300 --> 00:01:26.310 
it right you would need a controller

00:01:26.310 --> 00:01:29.870 
it right you would need a controller
like<00:01:26.549> this<00:01:27.829> supposedly<00:01:28.829> when<00:01:29.700> there's

00:01:29.870 --> 00:01:29.880 
like this supposedly when there's

00:01:29.880 --> 00:01:32.480 
like this supposedly when there's
charging<00:01:30.509> the<00:01:30.659> light<00:01:30.869> would<00:01:31.109> be<00:01:31.319> red<00:01:31.770> and<00:01:32.039> when

00:01:32.480 --> 00:01:32.490 
charging the light would be red and when

00:01:32.490 --> 00:01:35.239 
charging the light would be red and when
it<00:01:32.639> is<00:01:32.759> charged<00:01:33.450> light<00:01:33.869> would<00:01:34.079> be<00:01:34.229> will<00:01:35.100> be

00:01:35.239 --> 00:01:35.249 
it is charged light would be will be

00:01:35.249 --> 00:01:39.349 
it is charged light would be will be
green<00:01:35.689> or<00:01:36.689> some<00:01:36.899> reason<00:01:37.429> the<00:01:38.429> board<00:01:38.700> here<00:01:39.060> this

00:01:39.349 --> 00:01:39.359 
green or some reason the board here this

00:01:39.359 --> 00:01:41.510 
green or some reason the board here this
light<00:01:39.600> is<00:01:39.899> blue<00:01:40.319> instead<00:01:40.920> of<00:01:41.069> green

00:01:41.510 --> 00:01:41.520 
light is blue instead of green

00:01:41.520 --> 00:01:47.749 
light is blue instead of green
I'm<00:01:42.509> assume<00:01:42.990> this<00:01:45.499> 4.18<00:01:46.499> is<00:01:46.740> close<00:01:47.069> to<00:01:47.310> fully

00:01:47.749 --> 00:01:47.759 
I'm assume this 4.18 is close to fully

00:01:47.759 --> 00:01:50.440 
I'm assume this 4.18 is close to fully
charged<00:01:48.209> maybe<00:01:48.600> that's<00:01:48.899> why<00:01:49.109> is<00:01:49.170> blue<00:01:49.740> and

00:01:50.440 --> 00:01:50.450 
charged maybe that's why is blue and

00:01:50.450 --> 00:01:56.090 
charged maybe that's why is blue and
when<00:01:51.450> it<00:01:51.630> is<00:01:51.779> charging<00:01:52.200> it<00:01:52.529> should<00:01:52.709> be<00:01:52.920> red

00:01:56.090 --> 00:01:56.100 

00:01:56.100 --> 00:02:00.050 

got<00:01:56.700> it<00:01:56.820> from<00:01:56.940> China<00:01:58.670> similar<00:01:59.670> to<00:01:59.820> something

00:02:00.050 --> 00:02:00.060 
got it from China similar to something

00:02:00.060 --> 00:02:05.000 
got it from China similar to something
like<00:02:00.390> this<00:02:00.720> this<00:02:01.650> is<00:02:01.830> another<00:02:02.010> board<00:02:02.580> and<00:02:04.010> you

00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:05.010 
like this this is another board and you

00:02:05.010 --> 00:02:10.190 
like this this is another board and you
have<00:02:05.040> the<00:02:05.310> USB<00:02:05.610> here<00:02:06.450> the<00:02:07.260> input<00:02:09.050> that<00:02:10.050> is

00:02:10.190 --> 00:02:10.200 
have the USB here the input that is

00:02:10.200 --> 00:02:14.440 
have the USB here the input that is
capable<00:02:10.530> of<00:02:11.040> controlling<00:02:11.340> one<00:02:12.120> up<00:02:12.360> to<00:02:12.600> one<00:02:13.230> amp

00:02:14.440 --> 00:02:14.450 
capable of controlling one up to one amp

00:02:14.450 --> 00:02:18.680 
capable of controlling one up to one amp
so<00:02:15.450> you<00:02:15.510> can<00:02:16.200> use<00:02:17.160> different<00:02:17.550> kinds<00:02:18.450> of

00:02:18.680 --> 00:02:18.690 
so you can use different kinds of

00:02:18.690 --> 00:02:21.680 
so you can use different kinds of
lithium-ion<00:02:19.290> battery<00:02:19.890> this<00:02:20.850> one<00:02:21.150> like<00:02:21.360> I<00:02:21.510> said

00:02:21.680 --> 00:02:21.690 
lithium-ion battery this one like I said

00:02:21.690 --> 00:02:24.500 
lithium-ion battery this one like I said
it's<00:02:21.840> from<00:02:22.020> my<00:02:22.200> old<00:02:22.350> cell<00:02:22.650> phone<00:02:22.970> it<00:02:23.970> still<00:02:24.330> has

00:02:24.500 --> 00:02:24.510 
it's from my old cell phone it still has

00:02:24.510 --> 00:02:26.330 
it's from my old cell phone it still has
some<00:02:24.540> charge<00:02:25.080> but<00:02:25.410> I<00:02:25.500> didn't<00:02:25.800> want<00:02:26.010> to<00:02:26.130> use<00:02:26.310> it

00:02:26.330 --> 00:02:26.340 
some charge but I didn't want to use it

00:02:26.340 --> 00:02:31.970 
some charge but I didn't want to use it
because<00:02:27.770> a<00:02:28.940> new<00:02:29.940> battery<00:02:30.240> would<00:02:30.810> give<00:02:31.080> my<00:02:31.290> cell

00:02:31.970 --> 00:02:31.980 
because a new battery would give my cell

00:02:31.980 --> 00:02:36.890 
because a new battery would give my cell
phone<00:02:32.220> longer<00:02:33.080> talking<00:02:34.080> time<00:02:34.640> but<00:02:35.640> this<00:02:35.900> still

00:02:36.890 --> 00:02:36.900 
phone longer talking time but this still

00:02:36.900 --> 00:02:39.230 
phone longer talking time but this still
have<00:02:37.080> a<00:02:37.110> lot<00:02:37.380> of<00:02:37.410> charge<00:02:37.830> and<00:02:38.130> it's<00:02:38.340> that's<00:02:39.060> why

00:02:39.230 --> 00:02:39.240 
have a lot of charge and it's that's why

00:02:39.240 --> 00:02:45.100 
have a lot of charge and it's that's why
I'm<00:02:39.750> using<00:02:40.020> it<00:02:40.290> to<00:02:40.500> run<00:02:40.710> this<00:02:42.170> fan<00:02:43.170> of<00:02:43.470> mine

00:02:45.100 --> 00:02:45.110 
I'm using it to run this fan of mine

00:02:45.110 --> 00:02:49.640 
I'm using it to run this fan of mine
this<00:02:46.110> board<00:02:46.710> here<00:02:46.920> is<00:02:47.180> very<00:02:48.180> inexpensive<00:02:49.080> I

00:02:49.640 --> 00:02:49.650 
this board here is very inexpensive I

00:02:49.650 --> 00:02:54.500 
this board here is very inexpensive I
got<00:02:50.220> two<00:02:50.490> of<00:02:50.700> them<00:02:51.680> about<00:02:52.680> a<00:02:53.070> dollar<00:02:53.340> fifty<00:02:53.970> six

00:02:54.500 --> 00:02:54.510 
got two of them about a dollar fifty six
