00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.990 

I<00:00:02.720> mainly<00:00:03.720> work<00:00:04.200> on<00:00:04.470> observations<00:00:05.370> of<00:00:05.549> black

00:00:05.990 --> 00:00:06.000 
I mainly work on observations of black

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:08.179 
I mainly work on observations of black
holes<00:00:06.240> and<00:00:06.660> there<00:00:07.440> are<00:00:07.529> many<00:00:07.560> objects<00:00:08.040> out

00:00:08.179 --> 00:00:08.189 
holes and there are many objects out

00:00:08.189 --> 00:00:09.560 
holes and there are many objects out
there<00:00:08.220> in<00:00:08.400> the<00:00:08.490> universe<00:00:08.550> that<00:00:08.970> we<00:00:09.090> think<00:00:09.360> are

00:00:09.560 --> 00:00:09.570 
there in the universe that we think are

00:00:09.570 --> 00:00:11.959 
there in the universe that we think are
good<00:00:10.260> candidates<00:00:10.679> to<00:00:10.889> be<00:00:11.010> real<00:00:11.219> Astrophysical

00:00:11.959 --> 00:00:11.969 
good candidates to be real Astrophysical

00:00:11.969 --> 00:00:14.030 
good candidates to be real Astrophysical
black<00:00:12.120> holes<00:00:12.360> and<00:00:12.630> what<00:00:13.200> we<00:00:13.290> do<00:00:13.440> is<00:00:13.469> we<00:00:13.679> observe

00:00:14.030 --> 00:00:14.040 
black holes and what we do is we observe

00:00:14.040 --> 00:00:15.980 
black holes and what we do is we observe
them<00:00:14.309> at<00:00:14.429> the<00:00:14.519> same<00:00:14.790> time<00:00:15.120> from<00:00:15.480> the<00:00:15.599> ground

00:00:15.980 --> 00:00:15.990 
them at the same time from the ground

00:00:15.990 --> 00:00:18.590 
them at the same time from the ground
with<00:00:16.379> radio<00:00:16.800> telescopes<00:00:16.859> as<00:00:17.820> we<00:00:18.060> observe<00:00:18.180> them

00:00:18.590 --> 00:00:18.600 
with radio telescopes as we observe them

00:00:18.600 --> 00:00:20.650 
with radio telescopes as we observe them
from<00:00:18.779> space<00:00:19.109> with<00:00:19.470> orbiting<00:00:20.039> x-ray

00:00:20.650 --> 00:00:20.660 
from space with orbiting x-ray

00:00:20.660 --> 00:00:23.240 
from space with orbiting x-ray
observatories<00:00:21.660> and<00:00:21.900> what<00:00:22.710> we<00:00:22.800> find<00:00:23.010> is<00:00:23.220> that

00:00:23.240 --> 00:00:23.250 
observatories and what we find is that

00:00:23.250 --> 00:00:25.160 
observatories and what we find is that
as<00:00:23.550> we<00:00:23.760> would<00:00:23.880> expect<00:00:23.939> the<00:00:24.480> matter<00:00:24.810> as<00:00:25.050> it

00:00:25.160 --> 00:00:25.170 
as we would expect the matter as it

00:00:25.170 --> 00:00:26.960 
as we would expect the matter as it
falls<00:00:25.350> down<00:00:25.500> towards<00:00:26.189> the<00:00:26.340> black<00:00:26.460> hole<00:00:26.550> it

00:00:26.960 --> 00:00:26.970 
falls down towards the black hole it

00:00:26.970 --> 00:00:28.580 
falls down towards the black hole it
gets<00:00:27.150> hotter<00:00:27.390> and<00:00:27.599> hotter<00:00:27.779> and<00:00:28.140> that<00:00:28.320> starts

00:00:28.580 --> 00:00:28.590 
gets hotter and hotter and that starts

00:00:28.590 --> 00:00:30.349 
gets hotter and hotter and that starts
to<00:00:28.650> reduce<00:00:28.920> x-rays<00:00:29.460> that's<00:00:29.730> what<00:00:29.880> we<00:00:30.000> observe

00:00:30.349 --> 00:00:30.359 
to reduce x-rays that's what we observe

00:00:30.359 --> 00:00:33.080 
to reduce x-rays that's what we observe
with<00:00:30.900> the<00:00:30.990> satellites<00:00:31.380> from<00:00:31.560> space<00:00:32.090> but

00:00:33.080 --> 00:00:33.090 
with the satellites from space but

00:00:33.090 --> 00:00:34.549 
with the satellites from space but
naively<00:00:33.630> we'd<00:00:33.840> think<00:00:33.989> that<00:00:34.170> as<00:00:34.260> the<00:00:34.380> matter

00:00:34.549 --> 00:00:34.559 
naively we'd think that as the matter

00:00:34.559 --> 00:00:35.720 
naively we'd think that as the matter
falls<00:00:34.860> down<00:00:35.070> towards<00:00:35.430> the<00:00:35.489> black<00:00:35.640> hole

00:00:35.720 --> 00:00:35.730 
falls down towards the black hole

00:00:35.730 --> 00:00:37.430 
falls down towards the black hole
eventually<00:00:36.510> it<00:00:36.600> will<00:00:36.690> cross<00:00:36.930> what<00:00:37.140> we<00:00:37.260> call

00:00:37.430 --> 00:00:37.440 
eventually it will cross what we call

00:00:37.440 --> 00:00:38.750 
eventually it will cross what we call
the<00:00:37.559> event<00:00:37.829> horizon<00:00:38.340> of<00:00:38.399> the<00:00:38.460> black<00:00:38.579> hole

00:00:38.750 --> 00:00:38.760 
the event horizon of the black hole

00:00:38.760 --> 00:00:40.610 
the event horizon of the black hole
which<00:00:39.360> means<00:00:39.570> it<00:00:39.719> leaves<00:00:39.930> our<00:00:40.170> part<00:00:40.440> of<00:00:40.559> the

00:00:40.610 --> 00:00:40.620 
which means it leaves our part of the

00:00:40.620 --> 00:00:43.069 
which means it leaves our part of the
universe<00:00:40.710> and<00:00:41.309> it's<00:00:41.460> gone<00:00:41.550> forever<00:00:42.079> however

00:00:43.069 --> 00:00:43.079 
universe and it's gone forever however

00:00:43.079 --> 00:00:44.660 
universe and it's gone forever however
that's<00:00:43.320> not<00:00:43.500> what<00:00:43.649> we<00:00:43.800> find<00:00:43.980> we<00:00:44.160> find<00:00:44.190> that<00:00:44.460> as

00:00:44.660 --> 00:00:44.670 
that's not what we find we find that as

00:00:44.670 --> 00:00:46.760 
that's not what we find we find that as
the<00:00:44.910> matter<00:00:45.120> just<00:00:45.570> as<00:00:45.780> it<00:00:45.930> gets<00:00:46.170> towards<00:00:46.440> the

00:00:46.760 --> 00:00:46.770 
the matter just as it gets towards the

00:00:46.770 --> 00:00:48.979 
the matter just as it gets towards the
event<00:00:47.010> horizon<00:00:47.160> a<00:00:47.670> lot<00:00:48.059> of<00:00:48.180> energy<00:00:48.329> comes<00:00:48.780> out

00:00:48.979 --> 00:00:48.989 
event horizon a lot of energy comes out

00:00:48.989 --> 00:00:50.690 
event horizon a lot of energy comes out
from<00:00:49.260> very<00:00:49.559> close<00:00:49.800> to<00:00:49.950> the<00:00:49.980> black<00:00:50.219> hole<00:00:50.250> in<00:00:50.610> the

00:00:50.690 --> 00:00:50.700 
from very close to the black hole in the

from very close to the black hole in the
forms<00:00:51.030> long<00:00:51.420> thin<00:00:51.809> flows<00:00:52.230> which<00:00:52.469> we<00:00:52.620> call<00:00:52.800> jets

00:00:53.150 --> 00:00:53.160 
forms long thin flows which we call jets

00:00:53.160 --> 00:00:55.459 
forms long thin flows which we call jets
and<00:00:53.489> those<00:00:54.210> produce<00:00:54.539> radio<00:00:54.960> emission<00:00:55.320> which

00:00:55.459 --> 00:00:55.469 
and those produce radio emission which

00:00:55.469 --> 00:00:57.400 
and those produce radio emission which
we<00:00:55.620> can<00:00:55.770> observe<00:00:55.890> from<00:00:56.219> the<00:00:56.309> ground<00:00:56.579> and

00:00:57.400 --> 00:00:57.410 
we can observe from the ground and

00:01:39.230 --> 00:01:39.240 
fact I'm working right now over there on

00:01:39.240 --> 00:01:40.640 
fact I'm working right now over there on
my<00:01:39.329> computer<00:01:39.750> I'm<00:01:39.810> working<00:01:40.110> right<00:01:40.290> now<00:01:40.350> on<00:01:40.500> a

00:01:40.640 --> 00:01:40.650 
my computer I'm working right now on a

00:01:40.650 --> 00:01:42.830 
my computer I'm working right now on a
black<00:01:40.890> hole<00:01:41.130> that's<00:01:41.640> just<00:01:41.820> gone<00:01:42.119> off<00:01:42.150> in<00:01:42.600> the

00:01:42.830 --> 00:01:42.840 
black hole that's just gone off in the

00:01:42.840 --> 00:01:44.510 
black hole that's just gone off in the
nearest<00:01:43.200> galaxy<00:01:43.799> to<00:01:43.979> our<00:01:44.009> own<00:01:44.280> which<00:01:44.490> is

00:01:44.510 --> 00:01:44.520 
nearest galaxy to our own which is

00:01:44.520 --> 00:01:46.730 
nearest galaxy to our own which is
called<00:01:44.820> the<00:01:44.909> Andromeda<00:01:45.360> galaxy<00:01:45.590> and<00:01:46.590> there's

00:01:46.730 --> 00:01:46.740 
called the Andromeda galaxy and there's

00:01:46.740 --> 00:01:47.990 
called the Andromeda galaxy and there's
a<00:01:46.799> black<00:01:47.009> hole<00:01:47.220> that's<00:01:47.430> in<00:01:47.520> some<00:01:47.759> kind<00:01:47.939> of

00:01:47.990 --> 00:01:48.000 
a black hole that's in some kind of

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:49.969 
a black hole that's in some kind of
outburst<00:01:48.450> and<00:01:48.630> for<00:01:48.780> the<00:01:48.840> first<00:01:49.020> time<00:01:49.350> we've

00:01:49.969 --> 00:01:49.979 
outburst and for the first time we've

00:01:49.979 --> 00:01:51.649 
outburst and for the first time we've
actually<00:01:50.159> seen<00:01:50.490> these<00:01:50.729> Jets<00:01:51.060> coming<00:01:51.390> from<00:01:51.570> a

00:01:51.649 --> 00:01:51.659 
actually seen these Jets coming from a

00:01:51.659 --> 00:01:53.210 
actually seen these Jets coming from a
black<00:01:51.840> hole<00:01:52.020> in<00:01:52.170> another<00:01:52.439> galaxy<00:01:52.619> so<00:01:53.070> that's

00:01:53.210 --> 00:01:53.220 
black hole in another galaxy so that's

00:01:53.220 --> 00:01:54.870 
black hole in another galaxy so that's
very<00:01:53.250> exciting<00:01:53.490> and<00:01:53.970> it's<00:01:54.060> ongoing<00:01:54.180> right<00:01:54.540> now

00:01:54.870 --> 00:01:54.880 
very exciting and it's ongoing right now

00:01:54.880 --> 00:01:57.929 
very exciting and it's ongoing right now
I<00:01:55.170> would<00:01:56.170> say<00:01:56.409> it's<00:01:56.619> a<00:01:56.770> very<00:01:56.979> exciting<00:01:57.130> topic<00:01:57.820> I

00:01:57.929 --> 00:01:57.939 
I would say it's a very exciting topic I

00:01:57.939 --> 00:01:59.580 
I would say it's a very exciting topic I
would<00:01:58.090> say<00:01:58.299> you<00:01:58.360> know<00:01:58.630> from<00:01:58.840> obviously<00:01:59.049> biased

00:01:59.580 --> 00:01:59.590 
would say you know from obviously biased

00:01:59.590 --> 00:02:01.709 
would say you know from obviously biased
point<00:02:00.009> of<00:02:00.130> view<00:02:00.250> that<00:02:00.490> this<00:02:01.000> is<00:02:01.240> one<00:02:01.450> of<00:02:01.570> the

00:02:01.709 --> 00:02:01.719 
point of view that this is one of the

00:02:01.719 --> 00:02:04.139 
point of view that this is one of the
most<00:02:01.840> exciting<00:02:02.500> and<00:02:02.950> cutting-edge<00:02:03.430> areas<00:02:03.970> of

00:02:04.139 --> 00:02:04.149 
most exciting and cutting-edge areas of

00:02:04.149 --> 00:02:05.880 
most exciting and cutting-edge areas of
physics<00:02:04.390> and<00:02:05.200> that<00:02:05.470> it<00:02:05.560> would<00:02:05.649> be<00:02:05.770> very

00:02:05.880 --> 00:02:05.890 
physics and that it would be very

00:02:05.890 --> 00:02:08.670 
physics and that it would be very
exciting<00:02:06.159> thing<00:02:06.460> to<00:02:06.490> do
