and<00:00:54.059> you<00:00:54.149> guys<00:00:54.329> can<00:00:54.539> see<00:00:54.690> how<00:00:54.809> long<00:00:54.989> I've<00:00:55.199> been

00:00:55.340 --> 00:00:55.350 
and you guys can see how long I've been

00:00:55.350 --> 00:00:57.290 
and you guys can see how long I've been
using<00:00:55.530> it<00:00:55.829> and<00:00:55.980> judge<00:00:56.550> on<00:00:56.760> your<00:00:56.910> own<00:00:57.030> if<00:00:57.180> that's

00:00:57.290 --> 00:00:57.300 
using it and judge on your own if that's

00:00:57.300 --> 00:00:59.599 
using it and judge on your own if that's
enough<00:00:57.629> time<00:00:57.899> or<00:00:58.079> not<00:00:58.289> but<00:00:58.890> it<00:00:59.010> is<00:00:59.039> dirty<00:00:59.399> for

00:00:59.599 --> 00:00:59.609 
enough time or not but it is dirty for

00:00:59.609 --> 00:01:01.069 
enough time or not but it is dirty for
some<00:00:59.789> people<00:01:00.059> so<00:01:00.210> it<00:01:00.300> might<00:01:00.449> be<00:01:00.510> a<00:01:00.629> problem<00:01:00.870> for

00:01:01.069 --> 00:01:01.079 
some people so it might be a problem for

00:01:01.079 --> 00:01:02.720 
some people so it might be a problem for
people<00:01:01.260> who<00:01:01.620> don't<00:01:01.800> have<00:01:01.949> their<00:01:02.219> keyboards

00:01:02.720 --> 00:01:02.730

hidden<00:01:03.329> under<00:01:03.600> the<00:01:03.750> desks<00:01:04.290> so<00:01:04.830> you<00:01:04.890> might<00:01:05.159> have

00:01:05.329 --> 00:01:05.339 
hidden under the desks so you might have

00:01:05.339 --> 00:01:06.920 
hidden under the desks so you might have
to<00:01:05.489> clean<00:01:05.670> it<00:01:05.700> once<00:01:05.970> a<00:01:06.119> month<00:01:06.150> depending<00:01:06.810> upon

something I wanted to keep in mind for

00:01:11.130 --> 00:01:14.000 
something I wanted to keep in mind for
the<00:01:11.670> viewers<00:01:12.060> out<00:01:12.240> there<00:01:12.270> so<00:01:13.260> we<00:01:13.590> can<00:01:13.740> see<00:01:13.860> it

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:14.010 
the viewers out there so we can see it

00:01:14.010 --> 00:01:16.130 
the viewers out there so we can see it
is<00:01:14.130> a<00:01:14.159> Mac<00:01:14.400> layout<00:01:14.820> on<00:01:15.030> the<00:01:15.210> keyboard<00:01:15.689> the

but the function key is moved over to

00:01:19.590 --> 00:01:21.649 
but the function key is moved over to
the<00:01:19.710> right<00:01:19.920> in<00:01:20.159> order<00:01:20.580> to<00:01:20.790> add<00:01:21.030> the<00:01:21.270> macro

00:01:34.500 --> 00:01:37.010 
like a command key no matter how much
work<00:01:34.860> I<00:01:35.070> try<00:01:35.310> to<00:01:35.369> put<00:01:35.640> into<00:01:35.909> fixing<00:01:36.270> that<00:01:36.390> I<00:01:36.630> was

00:01:37.010 --> 00:01:37.020 
work I try to put into fixing that I was

00:01:37.020 --> 00:01:39.469 
work I try to put into fixing that I was
not<00:01:37.170> able<00:01:37.350> to<00:01:37.680> get<00:01:37.890> it<00:01:38.130> to<00:01:38.579> work<00:01:38.790> so<00:01:39.180> clearly

00:01:39.469 --> 00:01:39.479 
not able to get it to work so clearly

00:01:39.479 --> 00:01:41.929 
not able to get it to work so clearly
the<00:01:40.170> function<00:01:40.530> key<00:01:40.710> might<00:01:40.950> be<00:01:41.280> a<00:01:41.310> problem<00:01:41.790> for

00:01:41.929 --> 00:01:41.939 
the function key might be a problem for

00:01:41.939 --> 00:01:43.880 
the function key might be a problem for
some<00:01:42.150> people<00:01:42.180> if<00:01:42.750> they<00:01:42.899> use<00:01:43.079> dictation<00:01:43.320> a<00:01:43.680> lot

00:01:43.880 --> 00:01:43.890 
some people if they use dictation a lot

00:01:43.890 --> 00:01:45.469 
some people if they use dictation a lot
they'll<00:01:44.369> probably<00:01:44.579> have<00:01:44.850> to<00:01:45.000> memorize<00:01:45.450> a

00:01:45.469 --> 00:01:45.479 
they'll probably have to memorize a

00:01:45.479 --> 00:01:46.670 
they'll probably have to memorize a
different<00:01:45.930> key<00:01:46.110> if<00:01:46.229> they're<00:01:46.380> going<00:01:46.500> to<00:01:46.560> get

00:01:46.670 --> 00:01:46.680 
different key if they're going to get

00:01:46.680 --> 00:01:49.490 
different key if they're going to get
this<00:01:46.890> keyboard<00:01:47.390> so<00:01:48.390> I<00:01:48.420> rarely<00:01:48.780> see<00:01:49.320> myself

00:01:49.490 --> 00:01:49.500 
this keyboard so I rarely see myself

00:01:49.500 --> 00:01:51.230 
this keyboard so I rarely see myself
using<00:01:49.920> these<00:01:50.159> new<00:01:50.340> function<00:01:50.759> keys<00:01:50.939> that<00:01:51.180> you

00:01:51.230 --> 00:01:51.240 
using these new function keys that you

00:01:51.240 --> 00:01:53.389 
using these new function keys that you
see<00:01:51.509> here<00:01:51.990> I<00:01:52.110> guess<00:01:52.649> I'm<00:01:52.799> not<00:01:52.890> a<00:01:52.950> hardcore

00:01:53.389 --> 00:01:53.399 
see here I guess I'm not a hardcore

00:01:53.399 --> 00:01:55.940 
see here I guess I'm not a hardcore
gamer<00:01:53.729> but<00:01:54.450> the<00:01:54.630> programming<00:01:55.320> and<00:01:55.500> work<00:01:55.740> is

00:01:55.940 --> 00:01:55.950 
gamer but the programming and work is

00:01:55.950 --> 00:01:58.160 
gamer but the programming and work is
just<00:01:56.130> useless<00:01:56.729> for<00:01:57.390> me<00:01:57.540> to<00:01:57.780> spend<00:01:57.960> that<00:01:58.140> amount

00:01:58.160 --> 00:01:58.170 
just useless for me to spend that amount

00:01:58.170 --> 00:02:01.609 
just useless for me to spend that amount
of<00:01:58.469> time<00:01:58.860> programming<00:01:59.610> all<00:01:59.880> 10<00:02:00.600> extra<00:02:01.049> keys<00:02:01.320> on

00:02:01.609 --> 00:02:01.619 
of time programming all 10 extra keys on

00:02:01.619 --> 00:02:02.899 
of time programming all 10 extra keys on
the<00:02:02.070> function<00:02:02.490> keys

00:02:02.899 --> 00:02:02.909 
the function keys

00:02:02.909 --> 00:02:04.910 
the function keys
I<00:02:02.939> feel<00:02:03.450> like<00:02:03.600> Apple<00:02:03.990> added<00:02:04.170> the<00:02:04.409> right<00:02:04.560> amount

00:02:04.910 --> 00:02:04.920 
I feel like Apple added the right amount

00:02:04.920 --> 00:02:06.770 
I feel like Apple added the right amount
of<00:02:05.040> function<00:02:05.549> keys<00:02:05.670> already<00:02:05.909> so<00:02:06.329> I<00:02:06.360> didn't

00:02:06.770 --> 00:02:06.780 
of function keys already so I didn't

00:02:06.780 --> 00:02:08.510 
of function keys already so I didn't
bother<00:02:06.930> making<00:02:07.469> that<00:02:07.649> but<00:02:08.099> it<00:02:08.190> might<00:02:08.369> be

00:02:08.510 --> 00:02:08.520 
bother making that but it might be

00:02:08.520 --> 00:02:10.070 
bother making that but it might be
helpful<00:02:08.819> for<00:02:08.970> the<00:02:09.209> people<00:02:09.360> who<00:02:09.599> need<00:02:09.750> it<00:02:09.959> and

00:02:10.070 --> 00:02:10.080 
helpful for the people who need it and

00:02:10.080 --> 00:02:11.570 
helpful for the people who need it and
that's<00:02:10.379> something<00:02:10.709> nice<00:02:10.890> to<00:02:11.069> have<00:02:11.250> just

00:02:11.570 --> 00:02:11.580 
that's something nice to have just

00:02:11.580 --> 00:02:12.430 
that's something nice to have just
around

00:02:12.430 --> 00:02:12.440 
around

00:02:12.440 --> 00:02:15.070 
around
so<00:02:13.010> you<00:02:13.100> saw<00:02:13.370> the<00:02:13.430> thickness<00:02:13.940> and<00:02:14.180> razors<00:02:14.540> logo

00:02:15.070 --> 00:02:15.080 
so you saw the thickness and razors logo

00:02:15.080 --> 00:02:17.500 
so you saw the thickness and razors logo
the<00:02:15.410> keyboard<00:02:15.830> is<00:02:16.100> really<00:02:16.160> nice<00:02:16.970> because<00:02:17.300> the

00:02:17.500 --> 00:02:17.510 
the keyboard is really nice because the

00:02:17.510 --> 00:02:19.540 
the keyboard is really nice because the
keys<00:02:17.870> are<00:02:17.900> slanted<00:02:18.500> with<00:02:18.830> the<00:02:18.980> perfect<00:02:19.370> amount

00:02:19.540 --> 00:02:19.550 
keys are slanted with the perfect amount

00:02:19.550 --> 00:02:21.790 
keys are slanted with the perfect amount
of<00:02:19.700> room<00:02:19.760> in<00:02:20.030> between<00:02:20.480> so<00:02:20.990> there's<00:02:21.170> never<00:02:21.440> no

00:02:21.790 --> 00:02:21.800 
of room in between so there's never no

00:02:21.800 --> 00:02:24.190 
of room in between so there's never no
mistyped<00:02:22.400> and<00:02:22.790> you<00:02:23.210> can<00:02:23.390> hear<00:02:23.660> here<00:02:23.930> that<00:02:24.110> the

00:02:24.190 --> 00:02:24.200 
mistyped and you can hear here that the

00:02:24.200 --> 00:02:26.320 
mistyped and you can hear here that the
keyboard<00:02:24.380> does<00:02:24.680> get<00:02:24.920> pretty<00:02:25.160> loud<00:02:25.400> and<00:02:25.790> it

00:02:26.320 --> 00:02:26.330 
keyboard does get pretty loud and it

00:02:26.330 --> 00:02:28.180 
keyboard does get pretty loud and it
might<00:02:26.510> bother<00:02:26.720> some<00:02:27.140> of<00:02:27.440> your<00:02:27.560> roommates<00:02:27.980> if

00:02:28.180 --> 00:02:28.190 
might bother some of your roommates if

00:02:28.190 --> 00:02:29.740 
might bother some of your roommates if
you<00:02:28.310> do<00:02:28.460> have<00:02:28.640> roommates<00:02:29.000> or<00:02:29.240> someone<00:02:29.540> across

00:02:29.740 --> 00:02:29.750 
you do have roommates or someone across

00:02:29.750 --> 00:02:31.510 
you do have roommates or someone across
the<00:02:29.870> room<00:02:30.200> if<00:02:30.440> their<00:02:30.620> door<00:02:30.800> is<00:02:30.950> open<00:02:31.340> but

00:02:31.510 --> 00:02:31.520 
the room if their door is open but

00:02:31.520 --> 00:02:33.910 
the room if their door is open but
usually<00:02:32.240> it<00:02:32.450> doesn't<00:02:32.780> bother<00:02:32.870> people<00:02:33.230> I<00:02:33.710> don't

00:02:33.910 --> 00:02:33.920 
usually it doesn't bother people I don't

00:02:33.920 --> 00:02:35.680 
usually it doesn't bother people I don't
bother<00:02:34.220> I<00:02:34.520> don't<00:02:34.700> get<00:02:34.820> bothered<00:02:35.240> but<00:02:35.420> if<00:02:35.540> you

00:02:35.680 --> 00:02:35.690 
bother I don't get bothered but if you

00:02:35.690 --> 00:02:37.510 
bother I don't get bothered but if you
do<00:02:35.870> have<00:02:36.110> to<00:02:36.230> worry<00:02:36.410> about<00:02:36.530> that<00:02:36.830> you<00:02:37.010> can<00:02:37.310> get

00:02:37.510 --> 00:02:37.520 
do have to worry about that you can get

00:02:37.520 --> 00:02:39.610 
do have to worry about that you can get
the<00:02:37.640> silent<00:02:38.090> 'add<00:02:38.270> version<00:02:39.080> which<00:02:39.230> is<00:02:39.380> called

00:02:39.610 --> 00:02:39.620 
the silent 'add version which is called

00:02:39.620 --> 00:02:42.340 
the silent 'add version which is called
the<00:02:39.770> stealth<00:02:40.100> version<00:02:40.610> so<00:02:41.600> it<00:02:41.810> did<00:02:41.960> take<00:02:42.200> me

00:02:42.340 --> 00:02:42.350 
the stealth version so it did take me

00:02:42.350 --> 00:02:44.080 
the stealth version so it did take me
about<00:02:42.560> two<00:02:42.800> weeks<00:02:43.040> to<00:02:43.160> get<00:02:43.280> switched<00:02:43.850> over

00:02:44.080 --> 00:02:44.090 
about two weeks to get switched over

00:02:44.090 --> 00:02:46.030 
about two weeks to get switched over
from<00:02:44.360> a<00:02:44.480> laser<00:02:44.690> keyboard<00:02:45.260> to<00:02:45.350> a<00:02:45.380> mechanical

00:02:46.030 --> 00:02:46.040 
from a laser keyboard to a mechanical

00:02:46.040 --> 00:02:48.130 
from a laser keyboard to a mechanical
but<00:02:46.610> I<00:02:46.640> promise<00:02:47.090> you<00:02:47.210> I<00:02:47.240> won't<00:02:47.540> switch<00:02:47.870> back

00:02:48.130 --> 00:02:48.140 
but I promise you I won't switch back

00:02:48.140 --> 00:02:49.630 
but I promise you I won't switch back
because<00:02:48.500> this<00:02:48.650> is<00:02:48.830> so<00:02:49.010> much<00:02:49.070> more<00:02:49.430> of<00:02:49.490> an

00:02:49.630 --> 00:02:49.640 
because this is so much more of an

00:02:49.640 --> 00:02:51.490 
because this is so much more of an
immersive<00:02:49.940> experience<00:02:50.240> I<00:02:50.780> feel<00:02:51.230> like<00:02:51.350> I'm

00:02:51.490 --> 00:02:51.500 
immersive experience I feel like I'm

00:02:51.500 --> 00:02:53.530 
immersive experience I feel like I'm
getting<00:02:51.710> a<00:02:51.800> lot<00:02:51.950> more<00:02:52.190> work<00:02:52.400> done<00:02:52.640> even<00:02:53.390> though

00:02:53.530 --> 00:02:53.540 
getting a lot more work done even though

00:02:53.540 --> 00:02:56.470 
getting a lot more work done even though
it's<00:02:53.690> just<00:02:53.840> a<00:02:54.020> psychological<00:02:54.470> effect<00:02:55.480> so

00:02:56.470 --> 00:02:56.480 
it's just a psychological effect so

00:02:56.480 --> 00:02:58.180 
it's just a psychological effect so
let's<00:02:57.080> go<00:02:57.230> to<00:02:57.290> the<00:02:57.500> problems<00:02:57.920> with<00:02:58.070> this

00:02:58.180 --> 00:02:58.190 
let's go to the problems with this

00:02:58.190 --> 00:02:59.890 
let's go to the problems with this
keyboard<00:02:58.400> because<00:02:58.880> there<00:02:59.060> were<00:02:59.210> a<00:02:59.240> lot<00:02:59.360> for<00:02:59.720> me

00:02:59.890 --> 00:02:59.900 
keyboard because there were a lot for me

00:02:59.900 --> 00:03:02.110 
keyboard because there were a lot for me
as<00:03:00.680> you<00:03:00.890> can<00:03:01.070> see<00:03:01.250> here<00:03:01.460> the<00:03:01.550> keyboard<00:03:01.940> can

00:03:02.110 --> 00:03:02.120 
as you can see here the keyboard can

00:03:02.120 --> 00:03:05.200 
as you can see here the keyboard can
become<00:03:02.480> dead<00:03:02.810> at<00:03:03.050> some<00:03:03.380> point<00:03:03.650> where<00:03:04.340> it's<00:03:04.760> a

00:03:05.200 --> 00:03:05.210 
become dead at some point where it's a

00:03:05.210 --> 00:03:07.720 
become dead at some point where it's a
probe<00:03:05.510> it's<00:03:05.810> like<00:03:05.990> basically<00:03:06.920> nothing<00:03:07.520> works

00:03:07.720 --> 00:03:07.730 
probe it's like basically nothing works

00:03:07.730 --> 00:03:09.130 
probe it's like basically nothing works
you<00:03:07.970> can<00:03:08.120> see<00:03:08.300> that<00:03:08.450> the<00:03:08.600> brightness<00:03:08.810> keys

00:03:09.130 --> 00:03:09.140 
you can see that the brightness keys

00:03:09.140 --> 00:03:10.630 
you can see that the brightness keys
don't<00:03:09.320> work<00:03:09.470> only<00:03:09.950> thing<00:03:10.160> that<00:03:10.310> works<00:03:10.490> is

00:03:10.630 --> 00:03:10.640 
don't work only thing that works is

00:03:10.640 --> 00:03:12.460 
don't work only thing that works is
backlighting<00:03:11.270> because<00:03:11.510> that's<00:03:11.690> programmed

00:03:12.460 --> 00:03:12.470 
backlighting because that's programmed

00:03:12.470 --> 00:03:14.620 
backlighting because that's programmed
into<00:03:12.650> the<00:03:12.830> keyboard<00:03:13.220> itself<00:03:13.520> so<00:03:14.240> it<00:03:14.330> took<00:03:14.450> me

00:03:14.620 --> 00:03:14.630 
into the keyboard itself so it took me

00:03:14.630 --> 00:03:16.240 
into the keyboard itself so it took me
about<00:03:14.810> two<00:03:15.110> hours<00:03:15.530> three<00:03:15.740> hours<00:03:15.830> to

00:03:16.240 --> 00:03:16.250 
about two hours three hours to

00:03:16.250 --> 00:03:18.370 
about two hours three hours to
understand<00:03:16.880> that<00:03:17.209> I<00:03:17.270> had<00:03:17.480> to<00:03:17.600> reprogram<00:03:18.020> the

00:03:18.370 --> 00:03:18.380 
understand that I had to reprogram the

00:03:18.380 --> 00:03:20.380 
understand that I had to reprogram the
brightness<00:03:19.190> keys<00:03:19.459> because<00:03:19.700> they<00:03:19.970> switch<00:03:20.240> over

00:03:20.380 --> 00:03:20.390 
brightness keys because they switch over

00:03:20.390 --> 00:03:23.440 
brightness keys because they switch over
from<00:03:20.660> f1<00:03:21.110> and<00:03:21.260> f2<00:03:21.410> to<00:03:21.770> f4<00:03:21.950> teen<00:03:22.430> and<00:03:22.580> f15<00:03:23.209> and

00:03:23.440 --> 00:03:23.450 
from f1 and f2 to f4 teen and f15 and

00:03:23.450 --> 00:03:25.510 
from f1 and f2 to f4 teen and f15 and
since<00:03:24.170> the<00:03:24.260> function<00:03:24.650> key<00:03:24.800> didn't<00:03:25.070> even<00:03:25.190> help

00:03:25.510 --> 00:03:25.520 
since the function key didn't even help

00:03:25.520 --> 00:03:27.970 
since the function key didn't even help
me<00:03:25.670> I<00:03:25.910> was<00:03:26.390> just<00:03:26.570> stuck<00:03:26.780> in<00:03:26.810> a<00:03:26.990> big<00:03:27.200> mess<00:03:27.440> and

00:03:27.970 --> 00:03:27.980 
me I was just stuck in a big mess and

00:03:27.980 --> 00:03:29.830 
me I was just stuck in a big mess and
about<00:03:28.310> after<00:03:28.580> three<00:03:28.880> hours<00:03:28.910> of<00:03:29.209> figuring<00:03:29.720> out

00:03:29.830 --> 00:03:29.840 
about after three hours of figuring out

00:03:29.840 --> 00:03:32.140 
about after three hours of figuring out
what<00:03:30.050> my<00:03:30.200> problem<00:03:30.620> was<00:03:30.860> I<00:03:31.070> realized<00:03:31.880> that<00:03:32.090> I

00:03:32.140 --> 00:03:32.150 
what my problem was I realized that I

00:03:32.150 --> 00:03:34.330 
what my problem was I realized that I
had<00:03:32.420> to<00:03:32.540> reprogram<00:03:32.930> all<00:03:33.590> of<00:03:34.040> the<00:03:34.130> brightness

00:03:34.330 --> 00:03:34.340 
had to reprogram all of the brightness

00:03:34.340 --> 00:03:36.970 
had to reprogram all of the brightness
keys<00:03:34.730> which<00:03:34.940> was<00:03:35.120> not<00:03:35.420> fun<00:03:35.810> for<00:03:35.840> me<00:03:36.110> at<00:03:36.350> all

00:03:36.970 --> 00:03:36.980 
keys which was not fun for me at all

00:03:36.980 --> 00:03:40.210 
keys which was not fun for me at all
so<00:03:37.670> the<00:03:38.030> media<00:03:38.300> keys<00:03:38.540> didn't<00:03:38.810> work<00:03:38.990> the<00:03:39.470> F<00:03:39.620> 13

00:03:40.210 --> 00:03:40.220 
so the media keys didn't work the F 13

00:03:40.220 --> 00:03:42.670 
so the media keys didn't work the F 13
through<00:03:40.550> F<00:03:40.700> 19<00:03:41.209> are<00:03:41.360> useless<00:03:41.810> but<00:03:42.290> what<00:03:42.470> is

00:03:42.670 --> 00:03:42.680 
through F 19 are useless but what is

00:03:42.680 --> 00:03:45.010 
through F 19 are useless but what is
helpful<00:03:43.130> is<00:03:43.370> this<00:03:43.580> macro<00:03:44.030> key<00:03:44.300> and<00:03:44.570> the<00:03:44.810> numpad

00:03:45.010 --> 00:03:45.020 
helpful is this macro key and the numpad

00:03:45.020 --> 00:03:47.920 
helpful is this macro key and the numpad
that<00:03:45.470> goes<00:03:45.650> with<00:03:45.890> it<00:03:46.100> sometimes<00:03:47.030> we'll<00:03:47.750> see

00:03:47.920 --> 00:03:47.930 
that goes with it sometimes we'll see

00:03:47.930 --> 00:03:49.420 
that goes with it sometimes we'll see
that<00:03:48.080> I<00:03:48.110> need<00:03:48.350> to<00:03:48.500> use<00:03:48.650> math<00:03:48.890> on<00:03:49.100> my<00:03:49.220> keyboard

00:03:49.420 --> 00:03:49.430 
that I need to use math on my keyboard

00:03:49.430 --> 00:03:51.640 
that I need to use math on my keyboard
for<00:03:49.820> a<00:03:49.880> calculator<00:03:50.390> so<00:03:50.630> the<00:03:50.750> numpad<00:03:50.959> does<00:03:51.410> come

00:03:51.640 --> 00:03:51.650 
for a calculator so the numpad does come

00:03:51.650 --> 00:03:53.680 
for a calculator so the numpad does come
in<00:03:51.770> handy<00:03:52.160> even<00:03:52.700> if<00:03:53.000> it's<00:03:53.150> not<00:03:53.330> going<00:03:53.540> to<00:03:53.600> be

00:03:53.680 --> 00:03:53.690 
in handy even if it's not going to be

00:03:53.690 --> 00:03:55.270 
in handy even if it's not going to be
used<00:03:53.900> often<00:03:54.140> it's<00:03:54.500> a<00:03:54.560> nice<00:03:54.770> feature<00:03:55.010> to<00:03:55.250> have

00:03:55.270 --> 00:03:55.280 
used often it's a nice feature to have

00:03:55.280 --> 00:03:57.850 
used often it's a nice feature to have
and<00:03:55.730> we<00:03:56.510> can<00:03:56.660> see<00:03:56.840> here<00:03:57.020> that<00:03:57.200> the<00:03:57.410> keys<00:03:57.650> are

00:03:57.850 --> 00:03:57.860 
and we can see here that the keys are

00:03:57.860 --> 00:04:00.310 
and we can see here that the keys are
pretty<00:03:58.160> indented<00:03:58.820> and<00:03:59.000> let<00:03:59.720> me<00:03:59.810> just<00:04:00.020> go<00:04:00.140> into

00:04:00.310 --> 00:04:00.320 
pretty indented and let me just go into

00:04:00.320 --> 00:04:02.620 
pretty indented and let me just go into

noise<00:04:44.060> so<00:04:44.690> I<00:04:44.720> had<00:04:44.960> to<00:04:45.080> restart<00:04:45.290> my<00:04:45.740> whole

00:04:46.090 --> 00:04:46.100 
noise so I had to restart my whole

00:04:46.100 --> 00:04:48.250 
noise so I had to restart my whole
computer<00:04:46.340> so<00:04:47.240> basically<00:04:47.720> those<00:04:47.990> two

00:04:48.250 --> 00:04:48.260 
computer so basically those two

00:04:48.260 --> 00:04:49.659 
computer so basically those two
functions<00:04:48.770> are<00:04:49.010> useless

00:04:49.659 --> 00:04:49.669 
functions are useless

00:04:49.669 --> 00:04:52.510 
functions are useless
I<00:04:49.880> wish<00:04:50.150> Razer<00:04:50.840> thought<00:04:51.200> this<00:04:51.440> through<00:04:51.650> but

00:04:52.510 --> 00:04:52.520 
I wish Razer thought this through but

00:04:52.520 --> 00:04:54.340 
I wish Razer thought this through but
looking<00:04:52.940> at<00:04:53.060> the<00:04:53.180> program<00:04:53.750> we<00:04:53.900> can<00:04:53.930> see<00:04:54.200> that

00:04:54.340 --> 00:04:54.350 
looking at the program we can see that

00:04:54.350 --> 00:04:56.470 
looking at the program we can see that
synapse<00:04:54.650> does<00:04:55.100> work<00:04:55.340> well<00:04:55.550> it<00:04:55.790> does<00:04:55.940> not<00:04:56.090> crash

00:04:56.470 --> 00:04:56.480 
synapse does work well it does not crash

00:04:56.480 --> 00:04:58.930 
synapse does work well it does not crash
it<00:04:56.780> is<00:04:56.930> easy<00:04:57.169> to<00:04:57.380> program<00:04:57.620> stuff<00:04:58.160> it's<00:04:58.700> not

00:04:58.930 --> 00:04:58.940 
it is easy to program stuff it's not

00:04:58.940 --> 00:05:01.540 
it is easy to program stuff it's not
hard<00:04:59.240> to<00:04:59.360> learn<00:04:59.510> which<00:04:59.780> is<00:04:59.810> good<00:05:00.190> now<00:05:01.190> looking

00:05:01.540 --> 00:05:01.550 
hard to learn which is good now looking

00:05:01.550 --> 00:05:03.750 
hard to learn which is good now looking
at<00:05:01.669> the<00:05:01.790> pricing<00:05:02.270> of<00:05:02.360> the<00:05:02.419> keyboard<00:05:02.960> I<00:05:03.050> think

00:05:03.750 --> 00:05:03.760 
at the pricing of the keyboard I think

00:05:03.760 --> 00:05:06.580 
at the pricing of the keyboard I think
$140<00:05:04.760> is<00:05:04.940> a<00:05:04.970> lot<00:05:05.390> more<00:05:05.690> than<00:05:05.930> needed<00:05:06.290> to<00:05:06.410> buy<00:05:06.560> a

00:05:06.580 --> 00:05:06.590 
$140 is a lot more than needed to buy a

00:05:06.590 --> 00:05:08.620 
$140 is a lot more than needed to buy a
keyboard<00:05:06.940> especially<00:05:07.940> as<00:05:08.030> a<00:05:08.060> student<00:05:08.210> I<00:05:08.570> don't

00:05:08.620 --> 00:05:08.630 
keyboard especially as a student I don't

00:05:08.630 --> 00:05:10.960 
keyboard especially as a student I don't
see<00:05:08.930> this<00:05:09.140> worth<00:05:09.740> it<00:05:09.919> at<00:05:10.100> all<00:05:10.130> I<00:05:10.370> would<00:05:10.820> just

00:05:10.960 --> 00:05:10.970 
see this worth it at all I would just

00:05:10.970 --> 00:05:12.640 
see this worth it at all I would just
rather<00:05:11.150> get<00:05:11.480> something<00:05:11.900> cheap<00:05:12.169> or<00:05:12.380> get<00:05:12.530> the

00:05:12.640 --> 00:05:12.650 
rather get something cheap or get the

00:05:12.650 --> 00:05:15.070 
rather get something cheap or get the
$70<00:05:13.220> version<00:05:13.700> because<00:05:14.300> these<00:05:14.510> added

00:05:15.070 --> 00:05:15.080 
$70 version because these added

00:05:15.080 --> 00:05:16.930 
$70 version because these added
functions<00:05:15.590> are<00:05:15.710> just<00:05:15.740> gimmicks<00:05:16.340> to<00:05:16.490> make<00:05:16.760> you
