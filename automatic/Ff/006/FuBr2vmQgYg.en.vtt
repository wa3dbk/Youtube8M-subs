how these three characters have
absolutely<00:05:05.680> no<00:05:05.890> personality<00:05:06.160> but<00:05:06.730> I<00:05:06.850> think

00:05:07.050 --> 00:05:07.060 
absolutely no personality but I think

00:05:07.060 --> 00:05:08.400 
absolutely no personality but I think
they<00:05:07.150> have<00:05:07.270> plenty<00:05:07.600> of<00:05:07.750> personality

00:05:10.560 --> 00:05:10.570 
for example Brock has the personality of

00:05:10.570 --> 00:05:12.659 
for example Brock has the personality of
mud<00:05:10.900> misty<00:05:11.560> has<00:05:11.710> the<00:05:11.830> personality<00:05:12.370> of<00:05:12.400> motor

00:05:14.760 --> 00:05:14.770 
oil and even ash has the distinct

00:05:14.770 --> 00:05:17.220 
oil and even ash has the distinct
personality<00:05:15.460> of<00:05:15.640> sandpaper<00:05:16.240> now<00:05:16.570> I<00:05:16.840> know<00:05:16.990> what

00:05:17.220 --> 00:05:17.230

00:05:18.480 --> 00:05:18.490 
you're thinking isn't that a little

00:05:18.490 --> 00:05:20.670 
you're thinking isn't that a little
extreme<00:05:18.760> I<00:05:19.210> mean<00:05:19.570> even<00:05:19.810> sandpaper<00:05:20.350> can<00:05:20.590> be

00:05:20.670 --> 00:05:20.680
