00:00:09.670 --> 00:00:16.130
 Good. So you're going to need a glass. 

00:00:12.799 --> 00:00:22.359
 of wheat flour, right? 

00:00:16.130 --> 00:00:27.949
 half a glass of oil a glass of milk 

00:00:22.359 --> 00:00:29.720
 two eggs and a real wooden spoon and 

00:00:27.949 --> 00:00:33.080
 also a pinch of salt 

00:00:29.720 --> 00:00:36.410
 ok this is the measure of the cup is that 

00:00:33.080 --> 00:00:39.290
 Okay, good glass. I'll make the 

00:00:36.410 --> 00:00:41.680
 chicken then I deflected a breast from 

00:00:39.290 --> 00:00:44.510
 half chicken breast and such has 

00:00:41.680 --> 00:00:48.710
 I will have put all the spices that I 

00:00:44.510 --> 00:00:50.690
 I like it then stayed like this is the filling that 

00:00:48.710 --> 00:00:52.129
 to vote using my door 

00:00:50.690 --> 00:00:54.379
 Chicken then you, how did I say it? 

00:00:52.129 --> 00:00:56.989
 you may be using fillings from your 

00:00:54.379 --> 00:00:58.850
 It's a good preference, and it's very simple. 

00:00:56.989 --> 00:01:01.550
 because March only those ingredients 

00:00:58.850 --> 00:01:03.770
 that I said and everything goes 

00:01:01.550 --> 00:01:06.489
 blender is a simple and 

00:01:03.770 --> 00:01:06.489
 practical 

00:01:18.829 --> 00:01:23.939
 the staff on the tray you put a 

00:01:21.899 --> 00:01:26.789
 A little oil is to keep you from getting 

00:01:23.939 --> 00:01:30.509
 Of course, then, and then you will. 

00:01:26.789 --> 00:01:33.179
 you put the whole mass right and so 

00:01:30.509 --> 00:01:35.880
 You put the stuffing in there. 

00:01:33.179 --> 00:01:41.340
 slowly, he was sitting like that. 

00:01:35.880 --> 00:01:43.319
 the stuffing right and the filling has to be 

00:01:41.340 --> 00:01:46.380
 preference as it is there not much 

00:01:43.319 --> 00:01:48.659
 wet, because in order to avoid 

00:01:46.380 --> 00:01:50.939
 he stays different so he stays 

00:01:48.659 --> 00:01:53.459
 so a little bit wetter 

00:01:50.939 --> 00:01:57.090
 following you, you understand then you 

00:01:53.459 --> 00:01:59.729
 gently placing all the 

00:01:57.090 --> 00:02:01.950
 filling and then placing another part of the 

00:01:59.729 --> 00:02:03.629
 mass that remained that remained right 

00:02:01.950 --> 00:02:07.950
 so you're going to cover all the money 

00:02:03.629 --> 00:02:11.970
 the part of the filling is delicately and 

00:02:07.950 --> 00:02:14.819
 after one sitting there to with a 

00:02:11.970 --> 00:02:17.310
 knife with fork but at last I reap 

00:02:14.819 --> 00:02:19.079

00:02:17.310 --> 00:02:23.160
