 accountant this vigil there it's in 

00:02:57.220 --> 00:03:01.629
 that brings together the jean-franÃ§ois that we 

00:02:59.349 --> 00:03:03.970
 found a species of like a volcano and 

00:03:01.629 --> 00:03:05.890
 something innate in people who 

00:03:03.970 --> 00:03:07.480
 go to quebec who as soon as they touch 

00:03:05.890 --> 00:03:10.299
 starts a dance in a dense city 

00:03:07.480 --> 00:03:11.829
 there is a whole past that resurfaces almost 

00:03:10.299 --> 00:03:15.930
 instinctively 

00:03:11.829 --> 00:03:15.930
