enough times to like notice if we're on

00:00:51.030 --> 00:00:53.689 
enough times to like notice if we're on
the<00:00:51.059> wrong<00:00:51.510> track<00:00:51.570> right<00:00:52.289> so<00:00:52.980> I<00:00:53.010> was<00:00:53.190> like<00:00:53.340> is

00:00:53.689 --> 00:00:53.699 
the wrong track right so I was like is

00:00:53.699 --> 00:00:55.189 
the wrong track right so I was like is
this<00:00:53.760> this<00:00:54.210> isn't<00:00:54.420> the<00:00:54.600> right<00:00:54.629> and<00:00:54.930> she<00:00:55.110> was

00:00:55.189 --> 00:00:55.199 
this this isn't the right and she was

00:00:55.199 --> 00:00:56.689 
this this isn't the right and she was
like<00:00:55.320> no<00:00:55.500> this<00:00:55.710> isn't<00:00:56.039> the<00:00:56.129> right<00:00:56.160> one<00:00:56.430> but<00:00:56.640> I

00:00:56.689 --> 00:00:56.699 
like no this isn't the right one but I

00:00:56.699 --> 00:00:58.369 
like no this isn't the right one but I
feel<00:00:57.000> like<00:00:57.030> the<00:00:57.270> one<00:00:57.390> that<00:00:57.480> we're<00:00:57.690> wanting<00:00:58.140> is

00:00:58.369 --> 00:00:58.379 
feel like the one that we're wanting is

00:00:58.379 --> 00:01:01.069 
feel like the one that we're wanting is
not<00:00:58.980> that<00:00:59.190> far<00:00:59.489> away<00:00:59.609> I<00:00:59.730> think<00:01:00.149> that<00:01:00.390> this<00:01:00.870> one

00:01:01.069 --> 00:01:01.079 
not that far away I think that this one

00:01:01.079 --> 00:01:02.540 
not that far away I think that this one
is<00:01:01.199> just<00:01:01.230> really<00:01:01.680> close<00:01:01.980> to<00:01:02.160> the<00:01:02.250> other<00:01:02.340> one

00:01:02.540 --> 00:01:02.550 
is just really close to the other one

00:01:02.550 --> 00:01:03.799 
is just really close to the other one
and<00:01:02.670> that's<00:01:02.820> why<00:01:02.940> I<00:01:02.969> accidentally<00:01:03.420> chose<00:01:03.629> it

00:01:03.799 --> 00:01:03.809 
and that's why I accidentally chose it

00:01:03.809 --> 00:01:06.020 
and that's why I accidentally chose it
and<00:01:03.870> I<00:01:03.930> was<00:01:03.989> like<00:01:04.049> okay<00:01:04.320> well<00:01:04.830> let<00:01:05.010> me<00:01:05.040> you<00:01:05.939> know

00:01:06.020 --> 00:01:06.030

the other closest world market said that

00:01:22.770 --> 00:01:25.340 
the other closest world market said that

00:01:25.340 --> 00:01:25.350 
it was like eight miles away which

00:01:25.350 --> 00:01:27.469 
it was like eight miles away which
unfortunately<00:01:25.920> in<00:01:26.340> la<00:01:26.670> means<00:01:26.970> that<00:01:27.210> it<00:01:27.330> would

00:01:27.469 --> 00:01:27.479 
unfortunately in la means that it would

00:01:27.479 --> 00:01:29.870 
unfortunately in la means that it would
take<00:01:27.659> forever<00:01:27.900> to<00:01:28.409> get<00:01:28.560> there<00:01:28.770> so<00:01:29.040> those<00:01:29.850> of

00:01:29.870 --> 00:01:29.880 
take forever to get there so those of

00:01:29.880 --> 00:01:31.249 
take forever to get there so those of
you<00:01:30.119> who<00:01:30.240> live<00:01:30.329> in<00:01:30.420> the<00:01:30.479> country<00:01:30.810> that<00:01:30.900> sounds

00:01:31.249 --> 00:01:31.259 
you who live in the country that sounds

00:01:31.259 --> 00:01:33.380 
you who live in the country that sounds
silly<00:01:31.680> that<00:01:32.009> sounds<00:01:32.340> ridiculous<00:01:32.549> that<00:01:33.299> it

00:01:33.380 --> 00:01:33.390 
silly that sounds ridiculous that it

00:01:33.390 --> 00:01:34.789 
silly that sounds ridiculous that it
would<00:01:33.479> take<00:01:33.630> very<00:01:33.659> long<00:01:34.020> to<00:01:34.079> go<00:01:34.290> eight<00:01:34.530> miles

00:01:34.789 --> 00:01:34.799 
would take very long to go eight miles

00:01:34.799 --> 00:01:38.539 
would take very long to go eight miles
it<00:01:35.070> does<00:01:35.280> takes<00:01:36.119> for<00:01:36.570> ever<00:01:36.890> and<00:01:37.890> I<00:01:38.040> had<00:01:38.310> to<00:01:38.400> like

00:01:38.539 --> 00:01:38.549 
it does takes for ever and I had to like

00:01:38.549 --> 00:01:40.819 
it does takes for ever and I had to like
retune<00:01:39.270> my<00:01:39.570> brain<00:01:39.869> to<00:01:40.140> understand<00:01:40.619> that

00:01:40.819 --> 00:01:40.829 
retune my brain to understand that

00:01:40.829 --> 00:01:42.289 
retune my brain to understand that
because<00:01:41.040> when<00:01:41.310> I<00:01:41.340> see<00:01:41.610> something<00:01:41.850> that<00:01:42.090> says

00:01:42.289 --> 00:01:42.299 
because when I see something that says

00:01:42.299 --> 00:01:45.050 
because when I see something that says
oh<00:01:42.770> it's<00:01:43.770> only<00:01:43.860> three<00:01:44.220> miles<00:01:44.369> away<00:01:44.610> that's

00:01:45.050 --> 00:01:45.060 
oh it's only three miles away that's

00:01:45.060 --> 00:01:49.429 
oh it's only three miles away that's
awesome<00:01:45.540> that's<00:01:45.659> so<00:01:46.049> close<00:01:47.960> the<00:01:48.960> likelihood

00:01:49.429 --> 00:01:49.439 
awesome that's so close the likelihood

00:01:49.439 --> 00:01:50.960 
awesome that's so close the likelihood
that<00:01:49.470> that<00:01:49.590> will<00:01:49.770> take<00:01:49.920> you<00:01:50.040> so<00:01:50.549> long<00:01:50.579> to<00:01:50.759> get

00:01:50.960 --> 00:01:50.970 
that that will take you so long to get

00:01:50.970 --> 00:01:52.940 
that that will take you so long to get
to<00:01:51.030> just<00:01:51.899> dumb<00:01:52.200> you<00:01:52.409> should<00:01:52.560> have<00:01:52.649> just<00:01:52.740> walked

00:01:52.940 --> 00:01:52.950 
to just dumb you should have just walked

00:01:52.950 --> 00:01:59.870 
to just dumb you should have just walked
it<00:01:53.220> anyway<00:01:53.610> so<00:01:54.270> um<00:01:56.149> yes<00:01:57.149> so<00:01:58.049> I<00:01:58.610> was<00:01:59.610> like<00:01:59.729> okay

00:01:59.870 --> 00:01:59.880 
it anyway so um yes so I was like okay

00:01:59.880 --> 00:02:01.880 
it anyway so um yes so I was like okay
well<00:02:00.299> that<00:02:00.570> can't<00:02:00.869> be<00:02:00.960> the<00:02:01.140> right<00:02:01.290> one<00:02:01.560> because

00:02:01.880 --> 00:02:01.890 
well that can't be the right one because

00:02:01.890 --> 00:02:04.130 
well that can't be the right one because
it<00:02:02.430> says<00:02:02.610> that<00:02:02.790> it's<00:02:02.909> eight<00:02:03.149> miles<00:02:03.509> away<00:02:03.869> like

00:02:04.130 --> 00:02:04.140 
it says that it's eight miles away like

00:02:04.140 --> 00:02:06.020 
it says that it's eight miles away like
that's<00:02:04.350> really<00:02:04.950> far<00:02:05.310> from<00:02:05.549> here<00:02:05.729> and<00:02:05.820> she<00:02:05.939> was

00:02:06.020 --> 00:02:06.030 
that's really far from here and she was

00:02:06.030 --> 00:02:08.389 
that's really far from here and she was
like<00:02:06.149> yeah<00:02:06.479> that<00:02:06.810> can't<00:02:07.020> be<00:02:07.170> right<00:02:07.350> so<00:02:08.220> we<00:02:08.310> were

00:02:08.389 --> 00:02:08.399 
like yeah that can't be right so we were

00:02:08.399 --> 00:02:12.960 
like yeah that can't be right so we were
like<00:02:08.520> okay<00:02:08.670> it's<00:02:09.500> nearby<00:02:10.910> this<00:02:11.910> other<00:02:12.209> store

00:02:12.960 --> 00:02:12.970 
like okay it's nearby this other store

00:02:12.970 --> 00:02:15.630 
like okay it's nearby this other store
so<00:02:13.780> let's<00:02:14.050> type<00:02:14.260> in<00:02:14.410> that<00:02:14.860> store<00:02:15.220> because<00:02:15.490> it's

00:02:15.630 --> 00:02:15.640 
so let's type in that store because it's

00:02:15.640 --> 00:02:17.730 
so let's type in that store because it's
a<00:02:15.730> special<00:02:16.120> like<00:02:16.240> one<00:02:16.480> of<00:02:16.510> a<00:02:16.600> kind<00:02:16.840> store<00:02:17.110> but<00:02:17.680> I

00:02:17.730 --> 00:02:17.740 
a special like one of a kind store but I

00:02:17.740 --> 00:02:20.630 
a special like one of a kind store but I
great<00:02:17.950> type<00:02:18.220> that<00:02:18.520> in<00:02:18.790> and<00:02:19.000> then<00:02:19.090> we<00:02:19.840> find<00:02:20.080> that

00:02:20.630 --> 00:02:20.640 
great type that in and then we find that

00:02:20.640 --> 00:02:23.730 
great type that in and then we find that
then<00:02:21.640> we'll<00:02:21.910> know<00:02:22.090> where<00:02:22.930> world<00:02:23.230> market<00:02:23.620> is

00:02:23.730 --> 00:02:23.740 
then we'll know where world market is

00:02:23.740 --> 00:02:27.150 
then we'll know where world market is
because<00:02:24.250> it's<00:02:24.760> really<00:02:25.750> close<00:02:26.410> to<00:02:26.470> that<00:02:26.830> I<00:02:27.010> was
