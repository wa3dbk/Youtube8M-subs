 As expected the game will come loaded with many new features and 

00:00:37.300 --> 00:00:37.940
 improvements 

00:00:37.940 --> 00:00:41.900
 and proof of this is the number of modalities that will include having 

00:00:41.900 --> 00:00:47.210
 nothing less than 25 tournaments to overcome and 16 fun minigames that will put 

00:00:47.210 --> 00:00:51.550
 prove our dignity without forgetting of course that it is more important 

00:00:51.550 --> 00:00:52.820
 career mode 

00:00:52.820 --> 00:00:56.510

00:01:13.040 --> 00:01:14.550

 Achilles 

00:01:23.620 --> 00:01:26.910
 as masculine as the size of the Perez Valley

00:01:27.940 --> 00:01:30.940
 Rafael Nadal 

00:01:35.400 --> 00:01:39.050
 Although some may seem to be few, there is no problem since the game 

00:01:39.050 --> 00:01:42.750
 It also includes a complete character editor with which to create our 

00:01:42.750 --> 00:01:47.130

00:02:07.580 --> 00:02:08.929
 previous deliveries 

00:02:08.929 --> 00:02:13.629
 showing us now some characters that look almost real highlighting also the 

00:02:13.629 --> 00:02:16.969
 a great level of detail so much that the scenes as of the own public 

00:02:16.969 --> 00:02:20.609
 reaching all its splendor in the playstation version 

00:02:20.609 --> 00:02:23.809
 3 which will show a network 

00:02:23.809 --> 00:02:26.809
 80 points 

00:02:38.169 --> 00:02:41.429

 converted to this title before the best tennis simulator in history was 

00:02:45.489 --> 00:02:47.329
 amazing 

00:02:47.329 --> 00:02:50.469
 finding us once again with an extremely intuitive control 

00:02:59.989 --> 00:03:03.689
 also in this sense pleisteichon 3 will mark a new different 

00:03:04.199 --> 00:03:05.979
 because if we want it 

00:03:05.979 --> 00:03:09.189
 use the control motion sensor when buying 

00:03:09.189 --> 00:03:12.189

 virtua tennis 3 will see the light 

00:03:26.699 --> 00:03:28.909
 will be for that phrase 

00:03:28.909 --> 00:03:30.959
 however today they are given

 have confirmed the inclusion of online multiplayer mode 

00:03:36.489 --> 00:03:39.900
