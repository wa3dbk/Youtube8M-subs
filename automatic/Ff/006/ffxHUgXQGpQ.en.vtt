I get put on probation for host

00:02:10.769 --> 00:02:14.390 
I get put on probation for host
migration<00:02:11.150> it<00:02:12.150> was<00:02:12.299> nuts<00:02:12.540> totally<00:02:13.260> broken<00:02:13.560> so

00:02:14.390 --> 00:02:14.400 
migration it was nuts totally broken so

00:02:14.400 --> 00:02:17.119 
migration it was nuts totally broken so
it<00:02:14.790> was<00:02:14.969> just<00:02:15.000> a<00:02:15.269> flawed<00:02:15.540> system<00:02:15.810> but<00:02:16.680> I<00:02:16.920> do

00:02:17.119 --> 00:02:17.129 
it was just a flawed system but I do

00:02:17.129 --> 00:02:18.410 
it was just a flawed system but I do
think<00:02:17.489> that<00:02:17.609> they<00:02:17.790> can<00:02:17.849> bring<00:02:18.120> it<00:02:18.209> back<00:02:18.390> and

00:02:18.410 --> 00:02:18.420 
think that they can bring it back and

00:02:18.420 --> 00:02:21.140 
think that they can bring it back and
maybe<00:02:18.780> fix<00:02:19.140> some<00:02:19.379> of<00:02:19.409> the<00:02:19.530> bugs<00:02:19.799> in<00:02:20.010> it<00:02:20.129> let<00:02:21.090> me
