so in this run uh my goal was I know he
was<00:00:55.520> fast<00:00:55.730> than<00:00:55.910> me<00:00:56.000> my<00:00:56.149> goal<00:00:56.300> was<00:00:56.359> just<00:00:56.420> to<00:00:56.570> run

00:00:56.770 --> 00:00:56.780 
was fast than me my goal was just to run

00:00:56.780 --> 00:00:59.049 
was fast than me my goal was just to run
the<00:00:57.050> best<00:00:57.410> lebrun<00:00:57.800> that<00:00:57.890> I<00:00:57.949> could<00:00:58.190> I<00:00:58.430> came<00:00:58.940> in

00:00:59.049 --> 00:00:59.059 
the best lebrun that I could I came in

00:00:59.059 --> 00:01:00.459 
the best lebrun that I could I came in
with<00:00:59.180> a<00:00:59.210> pretty<00:00:59.420> decent<00:00:59.690> entry<00:00:59.870> here<00:00:59.989> I<00:01:00.050> think

00:01:00.459 --> 00:01:00.469 
with a pretty decent entry here I think

00:01:00.469 --> 00:01:01.810 
with a pretty decent entry here I think
I<00:01:00.649> did<00:01:00.829> really<00:01:00.859> go<00:01:01.190> to<00:01:01.250> that<00:01:01.370> outside<00:01:01.399> and

00:01:01.810 --> 00:01:01.820 
I did really go to that outside and

00:01:01.820 --> 00:01:04.689 
I did really go to that outside and
inner<00:01:01.910> clip<00:01:02.739> you<00:01:03.739> know<00:01:03.859> did<00:01:04.190> half<00:01:04.519> decent

00:01:04.689 --> 00:01:04.699 
inner clip you know did half decent

00:01:04.699 --> 00:01:06.490 
inner clip you know did half decent
transition<00:01:05.300> here<00:01:05.510> again<00:01:05.750> really<00:01:06.050> good<00:01:06.200> angle

00:01:06.490 --> 00:01:06.500 
transition here again really good angle

00:01:06.500 --> 00:01:07.780 
transition here again really good angle
really<00:01:06.710> smooth<00:01:07.040> I'm<00:01:07.220> really<00:01:07.430> proud<00:01:07.580> of<00:01:07.640> myself

00:01:07.780 --> 00:01:07.790 
really smooth I'm really proud of myself

00:01:07.790 --> 00:01:09.700 
really smooth I'm really proud of myself
here<00:01:08.150> and<00:01:08.270> then<00:01:08.360> I<00:01:08.390> come<00:01:08.750> in<00:01:08.930> transfer<00:01:09.680> a

00:01:09.700 --> 00:01:09.710 
here and then I come in transfer a

00:01:09.710 --> 00:01:11.950 
here and then I come in transfer a
little<00:01:10.100> bit<00:01:10.190> too<00:01:10.340> much<00:01:10.460> way<00:01:10.670> in<00:01:10.940> a<00:01:10.970> spin<00:01:11.210> out<00:01:11.330> so

00:01:11.950 --> 00:01:11.960 
little bit too much way in a spin out so

00:01:11.960 --> 00:01:14.440 
little bit too much way in a spin out so
not<00:01:12.680> of<00:01:12.950> course<00:01:13.160> the<00:01:13.460> lead<00:01:13.640> run<00:01:13.820> that<00:01:13.970> I<00:01:14.000> wanted

00:01:14.440 --> 00:01:14.450 
not of course the lead run that I wanted

00:01:14.450 --> 00:01:17.890 
not of course the lead run that I wanted
at<00:01:14.570> all<00:01:15.790> so<00:01:16.790> I'm<00:01:16.940> definitely<00:01:17.090> looking<00:01:17.420> for<00:01:17.870> a

00:01:17.890 --> 00:01:17.900 
at all so I'm definitely looking for a

00:01:17.900 --> 00:01:20.920 
at all so I'm definitely looking for a
stronger<00:01:18.680> follow<00:01:19.100> run<00:01:19.400> and<00:01:19.670> it's<00:01:20.630> gonna<00:01:20.750> be

00:01:20.920 --> 00:01:20.930 
stronger follow run and it's gonna be

00:01:20.930 --> 00:01:22.540 
stronger follow run and it's gonna be
hard<00:01:21.140> to<00:01:21.230> do<00:01:21.350> that<00:01:21.380> because<00:01:21.620> I<00:01:21.800> do<00:01:21.920> know<00:01:22.250> for<00:01:22.490> a

00:01:22.540 --> 00:01:22.550 
hard to do that because I do know for a

00:01:22.550 --> 00:01:24.700 
hard to do that because I do know for a
fact<00:01:22.700> that<00:01:22.850> he's<00:01:23.030> faster<00:01:23.360> than<00:01:23.390> me<00:01:23.570> so<00:01:24.380> here<00:01:24.560> we

00:01:24.700 --> 00:01:24.710 
fact that he's faster than me so here we

00:01:24.710 --> 00:01:27.280 
fact that he's faster than me so here we
go<00:01:24.740> on<00:01:25.130> that<00:01:25.280> second<00:01:25.730> run<00:01:25.760> of<00:01:26.120> course<00:01:26.900> i'm<00:01:27.080> at<00:01:27.260> a

00:01:27.280 --> 00:01:27.290 
go on that second run of course i'm at a

00:01:27.290 --> 00:01:29.890 
go on that second run of course i'm at a
huge<00:01:27.590> deficit<00:01:28.010> here<00:01:28.160> only<00:01:28.760> one<00:01:29.000> I<00:01:29.330> didn't<00:01:29.810> win

00:01:29.890 --> 00:01:29.900 
huge deficit here only one I didn't win

00:01:29.900 --> 00:01:31.810 
huge deficit here only one I didn't win
any<00:01:30.050> corners<00:01:30.440> I<00:01:30.560> don't<00:01:30.740> believe<00:01:30.980> because<00:01:31.550> he

00:01:31.810 --> 00:01:31.820 
any corners I don't believe because he

00:01:31.820 --> 00:01:33.850 
any corners I don't believe because he
did<00:01:32.000> stay<00:01:32.270> on<00:01:32.390> my<00:01:32.510> door<00:01:32.720> so<00:01:33.020> I<00:01:33.050> have<00:01:33.380> a<00:01:33.410> lot<00:01:33.830> of

00:01:33.850 --> 00:01:33.860 
did stay on my door so I have a lot of

00:01:33.860 --> 00:01:36.580 
did stay on my door so I have a lot of
ground<00:01:34.160> to<00:01:34.220> make<00:01:34.310> up<00:01:34.400> here<00:01:34.790> i<00:01:35.570> am<00:01:36.170> gonna<00:01:36.350> come

00:01:36.580 --> 00:01:36.590 
ground to make up here i am gonna come

00:01:36.590 --> 00:01:38.170 
ground to make up here i am gonna come
in<00:01:36.800> i'm<00:01:37.040> gonna<00:01:37.370> start<00:01:37.550> i'm<00:01:37.730> trying<00:01:37.850> to<00:01:38.000> come<00:01:38.090> in

00:01:38.170 --> 00:01:38.180 
in i'm gonna start i'm trying to come in

00:01:38.180 --> 00:01:40.180 
in i'm gonna start i'm trying to come in
straighter<00:01:38.510> make<00:01:39.020> up<00:01:39.470> some<00:01:39.650> ground<00:01:39.680> which<00:01:40.070> I

00:01:40.180 --> 00:01:40.190 
straighter make up some ground which I

00:01:40.190 --> 00:01:41.500 
straighter make up some ground which I
didn't<00:01:40.610> so<00:01:40.700> I<00:01:40.760> decided<00:01:41.060> to<00:01:41.120> again<00:01:41.360> on<00:01:41.480> a

00:01:41.500 --> 00:01:41.510 
didn't so I decided to again on a

00:01:41.510 --> 00:01:43.270 
didn't so I decided to again on a
throttle<00:01:41.900> and<00:01:42.020> unfortunately<00:01:42.650> just<00:01:42.920> under

00:01:43.270 --> 00:01:43.280 
throttle and unfortunately just under

00:01:43.280 --> 00:01:45.220 
throttle and unfortunately just under
steered<00:01:43.490> wide<00:01:43.730> and<00:01:44.060> pretty<00:01:44.900> much<00:01:44.960> set<00:01:45.200> the

00:01:45.220 --> 00:01:45.230 
steered wide and pretty much set the

00:01:45.230 --> 00:01:46.420 
steered wide and pretty much set the
tone<00:01:45.320> for<00:01:45.500> my<00:01:45.710> whole<00:01:45.890> run<00:01:46.100> nothing

00:01:46.420 --> 00:01:46.430 
tone for my whole run nothing

00:01:46.430 --> 00:01:49.390 
tone for my whole run nothing
spectacular<00:01:47.200> I'm<00:01:48.200> just<00:01:48.350> very<00:01:48.560> conservative<00:01:49.250> I

00:01:49.390 --> 00:01:49.400 
spectacular I'm just very conservative I

00:01:49.400 --> 00:01:50.800 
spectacular I'm just very conservative I
was<00:01:49.610> just<00:01:49.700> trying<00:01:49.970> to<00:01:50.000> catch<00:01:50.150> up<00:01:50.210> hard<00:01:50.630> and

00:01:50.800 --> 00:01:50.810 
was just trying to catch up hard and

00:01:50.810 --> 00:01:53.470 
was just trying to catch up hard and
then<00:01:50.960> here<00:01:51.350> I<00:01:51.560> tried<00:01:52.250> to<00:01:52.610> pour<00:01:53.030> on<00:01:53.060> the<00:01:53.180> angle

00:01:53.470 --> 00:01:53.480 
then here I tried to pour on the angle

00:01:53.480 --> 00:01:55.240 
then here I tried to pour on the angle
but<00:01:53.750> it's<00:01:54.020> too<00:01:54.200> little<00:01:54.320> too<00:01:54.470> late<00:01:54.620> he's<00:01:55.040> doing

00:01:55.240 --> 00:01:55.250 
but it's too little too late he's doing

00:01:55.250 --> 00:01:56.830 
but it's too little too late he's doing
the<00:01:55.310> same<00:01:55.520> thing<00:01:55.790> and<00:01:56.030> he's<00:01:56.180> got<00:01:56.360> the<00:01:56.480> gap<00:01:56.660> on

00:01:56.830 --> 00:01:56.840 
the same thing and he's got the gap on
