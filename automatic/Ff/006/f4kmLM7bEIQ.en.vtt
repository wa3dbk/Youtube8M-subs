barbless point on it red tying thread

00:00:42.660 --> 00:00:49.729 
barbless point on it red tying thread
and<00:00:43.980> just<00:00:44.980> make<00:00:45.220> a<00:00:45.489> head<00:00:47.280> mildly<00:00:48.280> elongated

00:00:49.729 --> 00:00:49.739 
and just make a head mildly elongated

00:00:49.739 --> 00:00:56.010 
and just make a head mildly elongated
like<00:00:50.739> so<00:00:52.440> put<00:00:53.440> a<00:00:53.470> half<00:00:53.950> hitch<00:00:54.220> in<00:00:54.570> to<00:00:55.570> secure

00:00:56.010 --> 00:00:56.020 
like so put a half hitch in to secure

cut<00:01:07.000> it<00:01:08.340> and<00:01:09.340> tie<00:01:09.670> it<00:01:09.700> so<00:01:10.119> that<00:01:10.360> the<00:01:11.789> the

00:01:12.779 --> 00:01:12.789 
cut it and tie it so that the the

00:01:12.789 --> 00:01:14.969 
cut it and tie it so that the the
feather<00:01:13.030> faces<00:01:13.509> forward<00:01:14.259> and<00:01:14.469> the<00:01:14.530> curve<00:01:14.829> is

00:01:14.969 --> 00:01:14.979 
feather faces forward and the curve is

feather faces forward and the curve is
away<00:01:15.310> from<00:01:15.639> you<00:01:17.249> just<00:01:18.249> like<00:01:18.369> that<00:01:18.729> take<00:01:19.420> your

00:01:19.620 --> 00:01:19.630 
away from you just like that take your

00:01:19.630 --> 00:01:27.149 
away from you just like that take your
hackle<00:01:20.469> pliers<00:01:21.329> and<00:01:23.159> grab<00:01:24.159> it<00:01:24.189> and<00:01:25.409> curve<00:01:26.409> the

hackle pliers and grab it and curve the

00:01:27.159 --> 00:01:29.789 
hackle pliers and grab it and curve the
fly<00:01:27.369> around<00:01:27.579> the<00:01:27.909> shank<00:01:28.149> and<00:01:28.450> as<00:01:28.539> you<00:01:28.749> as<00:01:28.959> you

00:01:29.789 --> 00:01:29.799 
fly around the shank and as you as you

00:01:29.799 --> 00:01:34.199 
fly around the shank and as you as you
wrap<00:01:30.779> just<00:01:31.779> a<00:01:31.869> couple<00:01:32.109> wraps<00:01:33.060> wet<00:01:34.060> your

wrap just a couple wraps wet your

00:01:34.209 --> 00:01:41.580 
wrap just a couple wraps wet your
fingers<00:01:35.039> and<00:01:36.039> pull<00:01:36.810> the<00:01:37.810> feathers<00:01:38.289> forward<00:01:40.590> so

00:01:41.580 --> 00:01:41.590 
fingers and pull the feathers forward so

00:01:41.590 --> 00:01:46.519 
fingers and pull the feathers forward so
that<00:01:41.829> they<00:01:41.979> stay<00:01:42.340> out<00:01:42.639> of<00:01:42.670> the<00:01:42.969> wrap<00:01:44.700> like<00:01:45.700> so

00:01:46.519 --> 00:01:46.529 
that they stay out of the wrap like so

00:01:46.529 --> 00:01:50.159 
that they stay out of the wrap like so
once<00:01:47.529> you<00:01:47.679> get<00:01:47.859> most<00:01:48.849> of<00:01:49.060> the<00:01:49.179> hackle<00:01:49.630> on<00:01:49.779> then

00:01:50.159 --> 00:01:50.169 
once you get most of the hackle on then

00:01:50.169 --> 00:01:53.669 
once you get most of the hackle on then
captured<00:01:50.799> with<00:01:51.759> the<00:01:51.909> thread<00:01:52.209> and<00:01:52.509> you<00:01:53.499> can

attach<00:02:35.139> them<00:02:36.030> in<00:02:37.030> a<00:02:37.120> standard<00:02:37.389> fashion<00:02:37.840> to<00:02:38.170> the

00:02:38.280 --> 00:02:38.290 
attach them in a standard fashion to the

00:02:38.290 --> 00:02:40.349 
attach them in a standard fashion to the
hook<00:02:38.439> shape<00:02:38.709> pitch<00:02:39.099> and<00:02:39.370> cat<00:02:39.549> pinch<00:02:40.060> it<00:02:40.239> and

00:02:40.349 --> 00:02:40.359 
hook shape pitch and cat pinch it and

00:02:40.359 --> 00:02:43.349 
hook shape pitch and cat pinch it and
capture<00:02:40.629> it<00:02:41.370> just<00:02:42.370> like<00:02:42.549> so<00:02:42.849> and<00:02:42.879> wrap

00:02:43.349 --> 00:02:43.359 
capture it just like so and wrap

00:02:43.359 --> 00:02:46.170 
capture it just like so and wrap
slightly<00:02:43.959> backwards<00:02:44.680> now<00:02:44.829> this<00:02:45.700> you<00:02:45.879> can<00:02:45.939> see

00:02:46.170 --> 00:02:46.180 
slightly backwards now this you can see

00:02:46.180 --> 00:02:49.949 
slightly backwards now this you can see
from<00:02:46.389> this<00:02:46.510> bobbin<00:02:47.459> this<00:02:48.459> bobbin<00:02:48.939> this<00:02:49.629> is<00:02:49.780> one

00:02:49.949 --> 00:02:49.959 
from this bobbin this bobbin this is one

00:02:49.959 --> 00:02:53.369 
from this bobbin this bobbin this is one
of<00:02:50.079> Wasatch<00:02:50.849> fly<00:02:51.849> tying<00:02:52.120> tools<00:02:52.450> bobbins<00:02:53.230> it's

00:02:53.369 --> 00:02:53.379 
of Wasatch fly tying tools bobbins it's

00:02:53.379 --> 00:02:56.580 
of Wasatch fly tying tools bobbins it's
called<00:02:53.650> a<00:02:53.829> Mitch's<00:02:54.400> dove<00:02:55.180> bobbin<00:02:56.139> were<00:02:56.349> ler

00:02:56.580 --> 00:02:56.590 
called a Mitch's dove bobbin were ler

00:02:56.590 --> 00:02:59.220 
called a Mitch's dove bobbin were ler
it's<00:02:57.400> got<00:02:57.549> a<00:02:57.579> little<00:02:57.790> dubbing<00:02:58.480> hook<00:02:58.750> on<00:02:58.930> here

00:02:59.220 --> 00:02:59.230 
it's got a little dubbing hook on here

00:02:59.230 --> 00:03:01.909 
it's got a little dubbing hook on here
so<00:02:59.620> you<00:02:59.709> don't<00:02:59.889> have<00:03:00.040> to<00:03:00.189> use<00:03:00.370> a<00:03:00.400> dubbing<00:03:00.879> loop

00:03:01.909 --> 00:03:01.919 
so you don't have to use a dubbing loop

00:03:01.919 --> 00:03:07.080 
so you don't have to use a dubbing loop
to<00:03:02.919> capture<00:03:03.489> your<00:03:04.290> peacock<00:03:05.290> curl<00:03:06.090> essentially

00:03:07.080 --> 00:03:07.090 
to capture your peacock curl essentially

00:03:07.090 --> 00:03:14.300 
to capture your peacock curl essentially
what<00:03:07.239> you<00:03:07.329> do<00:03:07.480> is<00:03:07.870> make<00:03:09.060> the<00:03:11.099> loop<00:03:12.419> like<00:03:13.419> so

00:03:14.300 --> 00:03:14.310 
what you do is make the loop like so

00:03:14.310 --> 00:03:18.240 
what you do is make the loop like so
wrap<00:03:15.659> four<00:03:16.659> or<00:03:16.719> five<00:03:16.870> times<00:03:17.260> around<00:03:17.439> to<00:03:17.799> secure

00:03:18.240 --> 00:03:18.250 
wrap four or five times around to secure
