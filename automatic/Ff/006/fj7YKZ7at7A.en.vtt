 in his book the life of bees 

00:00:06.970 --> 00:00:12.200
 maurice maeterlinck wrote he is 

00:00:10.099 --> 00:00:13.850
 manifest and agree and that a 

00:00:12.200 --> 00:00:15.440
 a republic so numerous and whose 

00:00:13.850 --> 00:00:17.810
 works are so varied and so 

00:00:15.440 --> 00:00:19.760
 wonderfully concerted 

00:00:17.810 --> 00:00:22.210
 subsist in silence alone 

00:00:19.760 --> 00:00:25.249
 spiritual time of thousands of beings 

00:00:22.210 --> 00:00:26.960
 in the darkness of the hive in period 

00:00:25.249 --> 00:00:29.119
 large blooms that are called the 

00:00:26.960 --> 00:00:31.279
 honey bees foraging more 

00:00:29.119 --> 00:00:34.310
 experienced so-called 

00:00:31.279 --> 00:00:36.160
 scouts back from foraging are in 

00:00:34.310 --> 00:00:38.539
 effervescence 

00:00:36.160 --> 00:00:41.420
 it is transmitted information by 

00:00:38.539 --> 00:00:42.739
 contact mr by smells and taste s 

00:00:41.420 --> 00:00:44.780
 also inform by vibrations 

00:00:42.739 --> 00:00:46.190
 that they produce by doing this 

00:00:44.780 --> 00:00:49.899
 choreography called the dance of 

00:00:46.190 --> 00:00:52.219
 bees discovered by cave fallow 

00:00:49.899 --> 00:00:54.079
 here we see a bee executed a 

00:00:52.219 --> 00:00:54.969
 dance in circles which means that the 

00:00:54.079 --> 00:00:57.019
 resources are close 

00:00:54.969 --> 00:00:59.420
 she was running fast while communicating 

00:00:57.019 --> 00:01:01.039
 with six antennas and making it taste 

00:00:59.420 --> 00:01:03.339
 its congeners the nectar it comes 

00:01:01.039 --> 00:01:03.339
 collect 

00:01:11.520 --> 00:01:13.520
 and 

00:01:41.880 --> 00:01:47.590
 it's other bees executed in 108 

00:01:44.670 --> 00:01:50.080
 resources are further away she 

00:01:47.590 --> 00:01:52.180
 indicates by its choreography the position 

00:01:50.080 --> 00:01:57.180
 compared to the sun the distance 

00:01:52.180 --> 00:01:57.180
 nectar quality and quantity 

00:02:16.990 --> 00:02:19.720
 and what about that at work that 

00:02:18.430 --> 00:02:22.000
 seems to shake other bees 

00:02:19.720 --> 00:02:24.360
 like to encourage them to go 

00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:24.360
