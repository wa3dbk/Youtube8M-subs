00:00:01.140 --> 00:00:04.670
 in elementary school or boy 

00:00:07.820 --> 00:00:10.510
 let's not do it 

00:00:18.650 --> 00:00:23.199
 Hi, it's me 

00:00:27.070 --> 00:00:32.140
 would not complicate flick in my case that if 

00:00:29.400 --> 00:00:34.180
 we put the left foot back in the 

00:00:32.140 --> 00:00:36.340
 tail and the right we put it on average 

00:00:34.180 --> 00:00:37.840
 height of the table with the left 

00:00:36.340 --> 00:00:40.000
 we poke to the left as if 

00:00:37.840 --> 00:00:42.070
 we were going to make a box today and with 

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:44.340
 right we drag to the right 

00:00:42.070 --> 00:00:47.610
 to make a flip 

00:00:44.340 --> 00:00:50.570
 in doing so the right follows the table and 

00:00:47.610 --> 00:00:50.570
 we left the left 

00:01:20.230 --> 00:01:26.130
 we sting in the back 

00:01:23.409 --> 00:01:26.130
 fix 

00:01:33.010 --> 00:01:36.240
 but no 

00:01:43.590 --> 00:01:49.480
 this afternoon 

00:01:46.610 --> 00:01:49.480
 or 

00:01:51.450 --> 00:01:59.140
 or 

00:01:53.969 --> 00:02:04.950
 we were not with the back foot 

00:01:59.140 --> 00:02:04.950
 we give you a punch
