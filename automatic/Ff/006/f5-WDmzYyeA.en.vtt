00:00:00.719 --> 00:00:04.420
 It is from Ganmon's 

00:00:02.510 --> 00:00:06.750
 this time 

00:00:04.420 --> 00:00:10.590
 What is it or not 

00:00:06.750 --> 00:00:14.600
 It is only a single ticket in the Raja 

00:00:10.590 --> 00:00:18.980
 I think the guy who's left flying this premium s re percent Kacha 

00:00:14.600 --> 00:00:23.990
 It has become a little too subtle I par in Well I say sr comes at par of probability to 

00:00:18.980 --> 00:00:25.230
 I think so, but ordinary rare tickets are only the premiere, but only PA City Par has risen. 

00:00:23.990 --> 00:00:29.030
 I want to 

00:00:25.230 --> 00:00:30.950
 But the king like I I was put to sleep the Tsukkomi 

00:00:29.030 --> 00:00:36.460
 For the time being, I'm putting it in and I'm disappointed 

00:00:30.950 --> 00:00:36.460
 I think I was playing as I said I would hit the supermarket 

00:00:37.980 --> 00:00:43.600
 If I'm late for my personal load, I feel like the sound of super rear 

00:00:41.460 --> 00:00:48.989
 Until I get here 

00:00:43.600 --> 00:00:48.989
 It is a subtle but I'm this super robbed caught Tsuria 

00:00:49.410 --> 00:00:54.610
 Erika Nakane 

00:00:51.350 --> 00:00:58.350
 Oh my head is this kind of feeling 

00:00:54.610 --> 00:01:02.160
 I'm going to use the first also now 

00:00:58.350 --> 00:01:05.909
 Go Why only thing go of Let's face Perth to go to another defeat 

00:01:02.160 --> 00:01:09.650
 Go you or oil Ikan I This is, for example, another your character 

00:01:05.909 --> 00:01:13.000
 Is the swimsuit below the car fast blue sky Tsurutani 

00:01:09.650 --> 00:01:15.280
 Oh this is an ace 

00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:19.890
 Snake 

00:01:15.280 --> 00:01:24.150
 A bit of a cat Mister full swing I remember the serpent God like a cat 

00:01:19.890 --> 00:01:26.070
 It is a manga of a jump that I miss, but I think it's an act that I know . 

00:01:24.150 --> 00:01:28.330
 Lake short 

00:01:26.070 --> 00:01:29.370
 The snake is Sanriku's face 

00:01:28.330 --> 00:01:34.830
 Something 

00:01:29.370 --> 00:01:36.120
 But it was a Anyway great players that use that kind of skill is 3 or which way or if you go separately 

00:01:34.830 --> 00:01:39.620
 I think I'm stuck 

00:01:36.120 --> 00:01:42.830
 It's better to get rid of the name. 

00:01:39.620 --> 00:01:46.190
 Do you feel like you are similar and do small business darkness 

00:01:42.830 --> 00:01:49.250
 Some par Puroga is with fur from show 

00:01:46.190 --> 00:01:51.100
 I think because I thought I was a little puck 

00:01:49.250 --> 00:01:56.530
 Well for the time being Mr. Snake 

00:01:51.100 --> 00:02:00.430
 It seems that usability is not good at the Anman show, but there is a personal Nagatsuka 

00:01:56.530 --> 00:02:06.610
 I feel like I did n't feel like there was no event 

00:02:00.430 --> 00:02:10.539
 This is why I use a par of the Premium sr ticket this time , and I 'm so rare after that 

00:02:06.610 --> 00:02:12.350
 Downright subtle combination called flying day-to-day island 

00:02:10.539 --> 00:02:18.640
 I passed 

00:02:12.350 --> 00:02:18.640
 Thank you very much I just want to end this video
