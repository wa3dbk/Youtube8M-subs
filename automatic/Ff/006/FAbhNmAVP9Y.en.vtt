00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.819
 In 2010, I bought the normal 

00:00:03.149 --> 00:00:07.980
 It 's going to be a lot of fun 

00:00:05.819 --> 00:00:12.150
 that I'm also in the new course 

00:00:07.980 --> 00:00:14.429
 July sold out in 2013 came out 

00:00:12.150 --> 00:00:15.719
 I built my new city from very far 

00:00:14.429 --> 00:00:17.609
 Of course, I often know that 

00:00:15.719 --> 00:00:19.710
 Tailoring and talked so often 

00:00:17.609 --> 00:00:22.109
 with the two porcupines until I 

00:00:19.710 --> 00:00:23.699
 the big sewing machine is known some 

00:00:22.109 --> 00:00:24.960
 Days later I wanted something in the 

00:00:23.699 --> 00:00:27.300
 download internet 

00:00:24.960 --> 00:00:29.880
 because I wanted to beautify my city 

00:00:27.300 --> 00:00:31.590
 Unfortunately, I found nothing good on the internet 

00:00:29.880 --> 00:00:33.840
 and I painted my own things 

00:00:31.590 --> 00:00:36.059
 But then I got into town 

00:00:33.840 --> 00:00:37.710
 older and full throttle the game sometime 

00:00:36.059 --> 00:00:39.239
 My mother said I should be my room 

00:00:37.710 --> 00:00:41.820
 especially to get visited 

00:00:39.239 --> 00:00:43.649
 I would my closet cleaned up 

00:00:41.820 --> 00:00:45.960
 rather an old example on the head 

00:00:43.649 --> 00:00:48.329
 and there is good at the one end casino 

00:00:45.960 --> 00:00:50.219
 he exclaimed, I could still do a lot 

00:00:48.329 --> 00:00:52.590
 Good to have a good time with you 

00:00:50.219 --> 00:00:54.180
 my city dwellers had a lot then 

00:00:52.590 --> 00:00:56.610
 you can live in my favorite city 

00:00:54.180 --> 00:00:57.420
 bully the wool always so sweet and good 

00:00:56.610 --> 00:00:59.399
 was in a good mood 

00:00:57.420 --> 00:01:00.780
 she had moved away and thus also the 

00:00:59.399 --> 00:01:03.390
 reason why I play this game for so long 

00:01:00.780 --> 00:01:05.400
 but no longer listened now 

00:01:03.390 --> 00:01:07.229
 I wanted to play it again and already 

00:01:05.400 --> 00:01:09.050
 in the first few minutes right that 

00:01:07.229 --> 00:01:11.090
 something was wrong 

00:01:09.050 --> 00:01:12.110
 I woke up in the night and could 

00:01:11.090 --> 00:01:14.360
 no longer intervene 

00:01:12.110 --> 00:01:15.860
 I felt like something was going on 

00:01:14.360 --> 00:01:16.730
 bad happen when I return 

00:01:15.860 --> 00:01:18.950
 fall asleep 

00:01:16.730 --> 00:01:21.980
 So I stayed up and later know 

00:01:18.950 --> 00:01:23.660
 not what I do not do so 

00:01:21.980 --> 00:01:25.490
 sugar sweet and cheerful music the 

00:01:23.660 --> 00:01:27.860
 always sounded with the logo played this 

00:01:25.490 --> 00:01:30.770
 melody that always comes in one 

00:01:27.860 --> 00:01:32.720
 horrorfilm and a shock can there 

00:01:30.770 --> 00:01:34.550
 I make my pace out of habit loud 

00:01:32.720 --> 00:01:36.680
 I tried them and 

00:01:34.550 --> 00:01:37.900
 to make made but it went 

00:01:36.680 --> 00:01:41.540
 strangely not 

00:01:37.900 --> 00:01:43.820
 then the logo appeared instead of the sheet 

00:01:41.540 --> 00:01:45.820
 what floated down fell an eye 

00:01:43.820 --> 00:01:49.040
 down and a loud scream sounds 

00:01:45.820 --> 00:01:50.690
 he was so up there that she herself 

00:01:49.040 --> 00:01:53.060
 nothing brought me ears 

00:01:50.690 --> 00:01:55.340
 but I was able to stop that 

00:01:53.060 --> 00:01:57.110
 not to come anymore if I did that 

00:01:55.340 --> 00:01:58.700
 This memory would last forever 

00:01:57.110 --> 00:02:00.800
 I did not want to pursue that 

00:01:58.700 --> 00:02:03.350
 take a purchase when I left the house 

00:02:00.800 --> 00:02:05.360
 I ran cold down the back of the 

00:02:03.350 --> 00:02:07.210
 ground wall bloodstained sporadic 

00:02:05.360 --> 00:02:09.649
 Parts of initiated lay around 

00:02:07.210 --> 00:02:10.280
 suddenly my mailbox started to 

00:02:09.649 --> 00:02:12.050
 flash 

00:02:10.280 --> 00:02:14.120
 I thought that there was a weird one 

00:02:12.050 --> 00:02:15.739
 Letters of a virtual parent or 

00:02:14.120 --> 00:02:17.930
 farewell letters from other residents 

00:02:15.739 --> 00:02:18.730
 were delivered but it was quite 

00:02:17.930 --> 00:02:21.290
 different 

00:02:18.730 --> 00:02:24.230
 on my monitor was the mailbox 

00:02:21.290 --> 00:02:27.530
 displayed great , I wait first 

00:02:24.230 --> 00:02:30.290
 not to click but has it 

00:02:27.530 --> 00:02:32.900
 and froze there lay the mutilated 

00:02:30.290 --> 00:02:37.120
 shorn and lifeless body of wolli 

00:02:32.900 --> 00:02:39.890
 then your words will be displayed in it 

00:02:37.120 --> 00:02:42.650
 mayor julia it is not that 

00:02:39.890 --> 00:02:45.650
 for what you receive, you will do the same 

00:02:42.650 --> 00:02:46.250
 Little escape as I started to 

00:02:45.650 --> 00:02:48.739
 cry 

00:02:46.250 --> 00:02:51.250
 unbelievable and because of volleys 

00:02:48.739 --> 00:02:54.440
 corpse in front of me was bloody in the mailbox 

00:02:51.250 --> 00:02:56.140
 then I saw my character big 

00:02:54.440 --> 00:02:58.500
 and with an excited 

00:02:56.140 --> 00:03:01.800
 facial expression in front of me 

00:02:58.500 --> 00:03:03.740
 she pressed herself over to her 

00:03:01.800 --> 00:03:07.380
 which probably warned me 

00:03:03.740 --> 00:03:07.980
 there was a living look into my life 

00:03:07.380 --> 00:03:10.460
 empty 

00:03:07.980 --> 00:03:13.320
 and yet directed in my direction 

00:03:10.460 --> 00:03:15.690
 Slowly she grimaced and laughed 

00:03:13.320 --> 00:03:16.760
 But I did not remember her words 

00:03:15.690 --> 00:03:19.620
 written 

00:03:16.760 --> 00:03:22.760
 it was a distorted electronic 

00:03:19.620 --> 00:03:24.810
 I agree with the hate that overflows 

00:03:22.760 --> 00:03:26.870
 sell them annually 

00:03:24.810 --> 00:03:29.760
 So you have looked here 

00:03:26.870 --> 00:03:32.760
 where do you not see what you are 

00:03:29.760 --> 00:03:34.950
 Expected here she disappeared I saw 

00:03:32.760 --> 00:03:37.650
 me everywhere I cause the cause 

00:03:34.950 --> 00:03:39.420
 my inhabitants wanted to find all that 

00:03:37.650 --> 00:03:42.690
 all lay dismembered on the floor 

00:03:39.420 --> 00:03:44.520
 organ brains thrive everywhere 

00:03:42.690 --> 00:03:47.640
 on the river appeared to me again and again 

00:03:44.520 --> 00:03:50.000
 she had red bloodshot eyes 

00:03:47.640 --> 00:03:52.020
 she misses half of her face 

00:03:50.000 --> 00:03:54.480
 and then she sang with her 

00:03:52.020 --> 00:03:56.420
 nightmarish voice soon that it 

00:03:54.480 --> 00:03:59.310
 forgive sorry for being so 

00:03:56.420 --> 00:04:02.430
 march stabbing pain and then you are 

00:03:59.310 --> 00:04:03.600
 free she came up to me i could 

00:04:02.430 --> 00:04:05.940
 do not move from place 

00:04:03.600 --> 00:04:08.910
 she stared at me shouting 

00:04:05.940 --> 00:04:11.160
 at noon I fell down and begged her 

00:04:08.910 --> 00:04:13.620
 that does not share but melinda values â€‹â€‹not 

00:04:11.160 --> 00:04:16.229
 instead , they took one 

00:04:13.620 --> 00:04:19.650
 big hammer said something else and 

00:04:16.229 --> 00:04:22.530
 smashed my head germany game 

00:04:19.650 --> 00:04:25.050
 over in bloody writing 

00:04:22.530 --> 00:04:27.910
 Last but not least , it is her face 

00:04:25.050 --> 00:04:31.450
 laughs and brutally out of the nintendo 

00:04:27.910 --> 00:04:33.910
 the console I will never again, and 

00:04:31.450 --> 00:04:36.100
 I still pray today that I do not 

00:04:33.910 --> 00:04:37.840
 several times with a strange imprint of the 

00:04:36.100 --> 00:04:40.980
 looks like a hammer 

00:04:37.840 --> 00:04:40.980
 wake up my forehead
