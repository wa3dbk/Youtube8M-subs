will ultimately diminish the look of
your<00:02:05.310> wheels<00:02:05.600> it's<00:02:06.600> an<00:02:06.659> easy<00:02:06.840> test<00:02:07.110> to<00:02:07.380> do<00:02:07.640> and

00:02:08.630 --> 00:02:08.640 
your wheels it's an easy test to do and

00:02:08.640 --> 00:02:10.530 
your wheels it's an easy test to do and
look<00:02:08.789> at<00:02:08.879> the<00:02:08.970> difference

00:02:10.530 --> 00:02:10.540 
look at the difference

00:02:10.540 --> 00:02:12.580 
look at the difference
so<00:02:11.540> if<00:02:11.599> you're<00:02:11.720> still<00:02:11.900> not<00:02:12.050> convinced<00:02:12.500> about

00:02:12.580 --> 00:02:12.590 
so if you're still not convinced about

00:02:12.590 --> 00:02:14.229 
so if you're still not convinced about
the<00:02:12.800> importance<00:02:13.190> of<00:02:13.280> pH<00:02:13.610> balance<00:02:14.090> when

your wheels in addition to being safe
one<00:03:06.410> of<00:03:06.440> the<00:03:06.530> great<00:03:06.739> things<00:03:06.950> about<00:03:07.040> the

00:03:07.300 --> 00:03:07.310 
one of the great things about the

00:03:07.310 --> 00:03:09.250 
one of the great things about the
titanium<00:03:07.760> wheel<00:03:07.879> cleaner<00:03:08.180> is<00:03:08.450> how<00:03:08.660> easy<00:03:08.930> it<00:03:09.140> is

00:03:09.250 --> 00:03:09.260 
titanium wheel cleaner is how easy it is

00:03:09.260 --> 00:03:11.860 
titanium wheel cleaner is how easy it is
to<00:03:09.470> use<00:03:09.790> now<00:03:10.790> take<00:03:11.090> a<00:03:11.120> dirty<00:03:11.359> wheel<00:03:11.629> like<00:03:11.840> this

00:03:11.860 --> 00:03:11.870 
to use now take a dirty wheel like this

00:03:11.870 --> 00:03:13.479 
to use now take a dirty wheel like this
what<00:03:12.349> we<00:03:12.470> would<00:03:12.590> normally<00:03:12.739> do<00:03:13.099> is<00:03:13.250> first

00:03:13.479 --> 00:03:13.489 
what we would normally do is first

00:03:13.489 --> 00:03:15.370 
what we would normally do is first
recommend<00:03:13.940> that<00:03:14.090> you<00:03:14.239> take<00:03:14.450> a<00:03:14.690> hose<00:03:14.930> and<00:03:15.290> you

00:03:15.370 --> 00:03:15.380 
recommend that you take a hose and you

00:03:15.380 --> 00:03:16.870 
recommend that you take a hose and you
rinse<00:03:15.560> off<00:03:15.799> the<00:03:15.950> wheel<00:03:16.130> and<00:03:16.400> that'll<00:03:16.609> get<00:03:16.700> any

00:03:16.870 --> 00:03:16.880 
rinse off the wheel and that'll get any

00:03:16.880 --> 00:03:18.780 
rinse off the wheel and that'll get any
excess<00:03:17.269> dirt<00:03:17.510> or<00:03:17.750> grime<00:03:17.930> off<00:03:18.260> of<00:03:18.290> the<00:03:18.530> wheel

00:03:18.780 --> 00:03:18.790 
excess dirt or grime off of the wheel

00:03:18.790 --> 00:03:20.890 
excess dirt or grime off of the wheel
then<00:03:19.790> you<00:03:19.880> can<00:03:20.000> take<00:03:20.090> the<00:03:20.239> titanium<00:03:20.750> wheel

00:03:20.890 --> 00:03:20.900 
then you can take the titanium wheel

00:03:20.900 --> 00:03:25.490
