00:00:06.450 --> 00:00:09.919

 Iran's supply anxiety is still in my heart 

00:00:18.980 --> 00:00:30.020
 When you wake up in the boatman it does not know the first thing to talk literature to those suffering 

00:00:25.040 --> 00:00:31.760
 Then again, I know that is getting to be more than'm talking earlier you know you're far 

00:00:30.020 --> 00:00:38.629
 Hex-opting 

00:00:31.760 --> 00:00:41.980
 What are you doing? If you spur the head, you're gonna have to lobby after a bad hip hop match . 

00:00:38.629 --> 00:00:41.980
 No charges found 

00:00:42.500 --> 00:00:51.729
 But I'm not so good side who studied 

00:00:46.010 --> 00:00:54.290
 If 60 people when I think elementary school had 330 intermediate layer in half 

00:00:51.729 --> 00:00:57.769
 Somewhat 

00:00:54.290 --> 00:01:02.000
 He did not do it with the ball. He went to medical school. 

00:00:57.769 --> 00:01:07.040
 So this is a little more the intention is not to not hit the pull-sweet 

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:08.360
 Why is it that my elementary school now has about half of what I used to do before 

00:01:07.040 --> 00:01:13.939
 I gave it on the air. 

00:01:08.360 --> 00:01:16.250
 4 geuraetdeoni I go to find in the minutes before the broadcast pd of the Busan High School 

00:01:13.939 --> 00:01:22.030
 I got my report card . 

00:01:16.250 --> 00:01:22.030
 So, I actually saw the report card for the first time in a long time. 

00:01:22.360 --> 00:01:30.100
 I really do not have a good time. 

00:01:24.550 --> 00:01:33.390
 I tried to defend myself for a while. 

00:01:30.100 --> 00:01:36.900
 It hurts 

00:01:33.390 --> 00:01:39.830
 Oh, I'll eat like this rubbish crushing grapple rattling 

00:01:36.900 --> 00:01:39.830
 It 's not like gum. 

00:01:41.280 --> 00:01:49.650
 It's very difficult. So yes . 

00:01:46.170 --> 00:01:55.770
 Actually , I think it's bearable if you struggle with it . 

00:01:49.650 --> 00:02:00.180
 So, when you sleep next to a big amount of class time, the next person is the author. 

00:01:55.770 --> 00:02:07.080

00:02:14.050 --> 00:02:25.120
 I used to go to the same old club like these days . 

00:02:18.430 --> 00:02:27.460
 I also did club activities so I do not have a little ah ah ah , 

00:02:25.120 --> 00:02:33.130

 So when I go there, I go to a service clinic. 

00:02:38.710 --> 00:02:44.320
 Itjaneo care of patients and the medical care that you need a volunteer errors 

00:02:43.240 --> 00:02:48.310
 I did it. 

00:02:44.320 --> 00:02:53.970
 You seem to have learned a lot of the world . Why? 

00:02:48.310 --> 00:02:57.760
 Man is a noble being Escaped Now everyone thinks for granted 

00:02:53.970 --> 00:03:03.130
 If the assumption is too difficult 

00:02:57.760 --> 00:03:09.400
 Oh, I can actually see that people get tired and their families can break. 

00:03:03.130 --> 00:03:09.970
 Okay, then I got a rheumatoid arthritis, so my grandmother had to go home. 

00:03:09.400 --> 00:03:14.080
 can 

00:03:09.970 --> 00:03:19.209
 So when I go to see you, meet with a middle school student's daughter 

00:03:14.080 --> 00:03:24.400
 My mother just walked away and Marvin passed away. 

00:03:19.209 --> 00:03:26.080
 My grandmother fed her granddaughter, and then she had rheumatoid arthritis 

00:03:24.400 --> 00:03:30.970
 Can not you do it ? 

00:03:26.080 --> 00:03:35.230
 Since then, my granddaughter has been a newspaper clerk from this elementary school 

00:03:30.970 --> 00:03:38.010
 I'm feeding my grandmother lived, so now when now I would have been charged student card 

00:03:35.230 --> 00:03:42.780
 I went to the house. 

00:03:38.010 --> 00:03:47.010
 One day, I suddenly got a lot of it. 

00:03:42.780 --> 00:03:51.590
 So the whole student daughter got away. 

00:03:47.010 --> 00:03:51.590
 So now she's dead. 

00:03:53.970 --> 00:04:00.840
 Ah reality're Mocha secondary transfer more than fiction 

00:03:57.480 --> 00:04:06.569

 So, at first, I know that you know very well 

00:04:10.110 --> 00:04:21.329
 I thought, yeah, but one day a little early the arrival of the cathedral, 

00:04:16.530 --> 00:04:24.449
 When I looked at the patients, I brought the little boys there . 

00:04:21.329 --> 00:04:27.750
 I'm sitting and consuming air again. 

00:04:24.449 --> 00:04:30.660
 As well as stone and pecking everytime alrya 

00:04:27.750 --> 00:04:36.600

 Even if you are very alienated, it's a medicine you bought for your money . 

00:04:52.590 --> 00:05:00.060
 When the time came to eat just snatching 

00:04:55.139 --> 00:05:02.720
 So then I'm suddenly had a thought away from neighborhood gossip
