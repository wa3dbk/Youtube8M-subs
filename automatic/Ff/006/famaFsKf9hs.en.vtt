00:00:01.060 --> 00:00:05.949
 me 

00:00:01.910 --> 00:00:05.949
 1 

00:00:06.440 --> 00:00:18.470
 Today is play It was touched a little necessary and bought air freshener 9 

00:00:10.790 --> 00:00:24.080
 Well speaking of air conditioning equipment, it's 8 tck 70 m white for the price 

00:00:18.470 --> 00:00:26.500
 I bought something of the type that is Uruoi Hikari Kuraire, so I would like to introduce it a little 

00:00:24.080 --> 00:00:26.500
 I will 

00:00:29.350 --> 00:00:32.590
 Written agreement 

00:00:31.470 --> 00:00:34.570
 I do not come 

00:00:32.590 --> 00:00:37.470
 In kaday 

00:00:34.570 --> 00:00:37.470
 After all, it is big 

00:00:38.930 --> 00:00:48.670
 Yes The main body is such a size It is quite large after all thickness 

00:00:44.200 --> 00:00:55.300
 There you and in've been pressed together a little record button now Kondake 

00:00:48.670 --> 00:00:58.540
 Dust collection of even though Masu thought Teyari there is this black frame is in the remove it or have pre 

00:00:55.300 --> 00:01:02.350
 A filter is included. This prisoner filterer is this 

00:00:58.540 --> 00:01:04.190
 It was put in a plastic bag, so it's about removing it again 

00:01:02.350 --> 00:01:07.030
 I think it's a bit confusing 

00:01:04.190 --> 00:01:11.560
 Dust collecting filter is something like 

00:01:07.030 --> 00:01:14.290
 Because it is written in an easy- to- understand manner that this is like this in front of me like this 

00:01:11.560 --> 00:01:16.380
 You will not be mistaken for installation 

00:01:14.290 --> 00:01:18.430
 Let me do this 

00:01:16.380 --> 00:01:21.560
 As 

00:01:18.430 --> 00:01:27.470
 Is this play filter different from that? 

00:01:21.560 --> 00:01:31.789
 I back Which is I think I say this but I think it is that hard to little visible 

00:01:27.470 --> 00:01:33.409
 That game Toka Which becomes difficult to see that the good I mean kick was yearns Remember me on 

00:01:31.789 --> 00:01:38.299
 I think that is often 

00:01:33.409 --> 00:01:43.360
 It's small enough I'm writing this front or the front, so I won't make a mistake 

00:01:38.299 --> 00:01:43.360
 That's why I like this kind of fine point 

00:01:44.340 --> 00:01:51.020
 Yes I can now set it and reattach the body cover 

00:01:52.630 --> 00:01:57.479
 Hmm 

00:01:53.520 --> 00:02:04.200
 I guess maybe I already finished this 

00:01:57.479 --> 00:02:06.659
 Because I would like to introduce the topic of the detailed topic or the feeling of use or something again 

00:02:04.200 --> 00:02:11.549
 I would like to turn on the power for the time being 

00:02:06.659 --> 00:02:12.209
 I just want to show you a bit of how much air flow comes out 

00:02:11.549 --> 00:02:13.510
 I am 

00:02:12.209 --> 00:02:16.290
 First, in the fact that 

00:02:13.510 --> 00:02:16.290
 Turn on 

00:02:17.920 --> 00:02:29.640
 I turned on the outlet. I will turn on the power from now but maybe 

00:02:22.950 --> 00:02:31.040
 It's a room filled with very old-fashioned odors, so I guess you might hear the sound of a flawed machine suddenly 

00:02:29.640 --> 00:02:36.370
 I think 

00:02:31.040 --> 00:02:36.370
 N'the switch Let's put the time being 

00:02:38.520 --> 00:02:43.970
 It is quite quiet 

00:02:40.710 --> 00:02:49.790
 It is in automatic mode now 

00:02:43.970 --> 00:02:53.780
 It may be a bit hard to see, but here you can see the current humidity now 

00:02:49.790 --> 00:02:56.780
 I kept the cooler for 43% humidity 

00:02:53.780 --> 00:02:59.650
 The humidity is quite low, isn't it? 

00:02:56.780 --> 00:03:03.819
 Well then it's the amount of wind 

00:02:59.650 --> 00:03:05.100
 I want to make it suddenly because it is automatic now 

00:03:03.819 --> 00:03:07.970
 I will go 

00:03:05.100 --> 00:03:07.970
 Pee pitch 

00:03:14.800 --> 00:03:25.750
 Although this part is raised up and the wind goes up almost straight up 

00:03:20.050 --> 00:03:28.660
 If it's going to go, the wind is going in the direction of the camera and the microphone now, so maybe 

00:03:25.750 --> 00:03:31.560
 Mike thinks I will pick up the wind 

00:03:28.660 --> 00:03:31.560
 I will try to think 

00:03:37.490 --> 00:03:40.180
 Close 

00:03:49.460 --> 00:03:51.490
 Oh 

00:03:51.860 --> 00:04:02.780
 I understand the feeling of the sound It is quite windy 

00:03:57.410 --> 00:04:08.209
 In terms of images, it 's about today's fans 

00:04:02.780 --> 00:04:12.650
 In it has come out in the contemporary is great momentum in the strength out only crowded from here Rutte it is 

00:04:08.209 --> 00:04:16.549
 It means that I'm just sucking in the wind from the lower ones. 

00:04:12.650 --> 00:04:20.380
 It is try to use one number for a while eh door also a feeling of use, etc. 

00:04:16.549 --> 00:04:25.150
 I want to talk from now on 

00:04:20.380 --> 00:04:33.090
 Tteyuu movement place in the air cleaner room is given me is still important 

00:04:25.150 --> 00:04:33.090
 According to Mr. Sky, it seems to be better to pull out air conditioner and diagonally
