00:00:49.220 --> 00:00:49.230 
sides of the knuckle steer things should

00:00:49.230 --> 00:00:54.229 
sides of the knuckle steer things should
just<00:00:49.410> fall<00:00:49.620> off<00:00:51.500> and<00:00:52.610> get<00:00:53.610> it<00:00:53.699> ready<00:00:53.820> to<00:00:54.000> the

00:00:54.229 --> 00:00:54.239 
just fall off and get it ready to the

00:00:54.239 --> 00:00:57.529 
just fall off and get it ready to the
knuckles<00:00:55.160> so<00:00:56.160> them<00:00:56.340> to<00:00:56.520> the<00:00:56.640> side<00:00:56.910> you<00:00:57.270> have<00:00:57.360> to

00:00:57.529 --> 00:00:57.539 
knuckles so them to the side you have to

00:00:57.539 --> 00:01:00.979 
knuckles so them to the side you have to
swap<00:00:57.870> out<00:00:58.020> the<00:00:58.109> bearings<00:00:58.440> afterwards<00:00:59.390> and<00:01:00.390> do

00:01:00.979 --> 00:01:00.989 
swap out the bearings afterwards and do

00:01:00.989 --> 00:01:09.140 
swap out the bearings afterwards and do
the<00:01:01.109> same<00:01:01.379> with<00:01:01.559> the<00:01:01.649> C<00:01:01.859> hubs<00:01:06.979> all<00:01:07.979> right<00:01:08.280> so<00:01:08.640> C

00:01:09.140 --> 00:01:09.150 
the same with the C hubs all right so C

00:01:09.150 --> 00:01:12.170 
the same with the C hubs all right so C
hubs<00:01:09.360> they're<00:01:09.510> out<00:01:10.520> replace<00:01:11.520> those<00:01:11.820> with<00:01:12.060> the

00:01:12.170 --> 00:01:12.180 
hubs they're out replace those with the

00:01:12.180 --> 00:01:15.260 
hubs they're out replace those with the
aluminum<00:01:12.570> ones<00:01:12.720> I<00:01:13.189> have<00:01:14.189> mine<00:01:14.490> clocked<00:01:14.850> as<00:01:15.060> far

00:01:15.260 --> 00:01:15.270 
aluminum ones I have mine clocked as far

00:01:15.270 --> 00:01:23.630 
aluminum ones I have mine clocked as far
back<00:01:15.450> as<00:01:15.689> possible<00:01:21.259> secure<00:01:22.259> that<00:01:22.560> one<00:01:23.400> screw

back as possible secure that one screw
at<00:01:23.729> the<00:01:23.790> top<00:01:23.850> let's<00:01:24.270> screw<00:01:24.390> at<00:01:24.479> the<00:01:24.509> bottom

00:01:25.270 --> 00:01:25.280 
at the top let's screw at the bottom

00:01:25.280 --> 00:01:29.660 
at the top let's screw at the bottom
same<00:01:26.280> for<00:01:26.580> both<00:01:26.700> sides<00:01:28.220> and<00:01:29.220> then<00:01:29.520> I'm<00:01:29.579> gonna

00:01:29.660 --> 00:01:29.670 
same for both sides and then I'm gonna

00:01:29.670 --> 00:01:31.490

make<00:01:29.790> our<00:01:29.970> way<00:01:30.060> over<00:01:30.090> to<00:01:30.390> the<00:01:30.600> knuckles<00:01:31.170> so

00:01:31.490 --> 00:01:31.500 
make our way over to the knuckles so

00:01:31.500 --> 00:01:32.600 
make our way over to the knuckles so
just<00:01:31.710> make<00:01:31.829> sure<00:01:31.860> to<00:01:31.979> transfer<00:01:32.430> all<00:01:32.579> your

well work with the diff covers hard to
do<00:02:03.299> if<00:02:03.450> we<00:02:03.630> install<00:02:04.110> the<00:02:04.229> steering<00:02:04.469> links

00:02:04.789 --> 00:02:04.799 
do if we install the steering links

00:02:04.799 --> 00:02:08.210 
do if we install the steering links
first<00:02:06.229> I'm<00:02:07.229> surprised<00:02:07.619> that<00:02:07.649> all<00:02:07.920> along<00:02:08.069> these

00:02:08.210 --> 00:02:08.220 
first I'm surprised that all along these

00:02:08.220 --> 00:02:10.999 
first I'm surprised that all along these
screws<00:02:08.520> are<00:02:08.810> glad<00:02:09.810> to<00:02:09.840> see<00:02:10.110> that<00:02:10.289> the<00:02:10.440> HR<00:02:10.800> ones

00:02:10.999 --> 00:02:11.009 
screws are glad to see that the HR ones

00:02:11.009 --> 00:02:16.570 
screws are glad to see that the HR ones
are<00:02:11.220> a<00:02:11.250> lot<00:02:11.489> shorter

00:02:16.570 --> 00:02:16.580 

00:02:16.580 --> 00:02:20.060 

all<00:02:17.580> right<00:02:17.760> so<00:02:18.090> reinstall<00:02:18.960> that<00:02:18.990> it's<00:02:19.830> already

00:02:20.060 --> 00:02:20.070 
all right so reinstall that it's already

00:02:20.070 --> 00:02:23.660 
all right so reinstall that it's already
looking<00:02:20.280> pretty<00:02:21.180> good<00:02:22.220> that<00:02:23.220> doesn't<00:02:23.550> really

00:02:23.660 --> 00:02:23.670 
looking pretty good that doesn't really

00:02:23.670 --> 00:02:26.390 
looking pretty good that doesn't really
add<00:02:23.880> any<00:02:24.090> functionality<00:02:24.540> but<00:02:24.930> it's<00:02:25.110> got<00:02:25.290> a<00:02:25.400> WOW

00:02:26.390 --> 00:02:26.400 
add any functionality but it's got a WOW

00:02:26.400 --> 00:02:29.480 
add any functionality but it's got a WOW
factor<00:02:27.980> all<00:02:28.980> right

00:02:29.480 --> 00:02:29.490 
factor all right

00:02:29.490 --> 00:02:34.040 
factor all right
steering<00:02:30.270> links<00:02:30.540> much<00:02:31.320> needed<00:02:32.600> and<00:02:33.600> install

00:02:34.040 --> 00:02:34.050 
steering links much needed and install

00:02:34.050 --> 00:02:35.600 
steering links much needed and install
that<00:02:34.200> on<00:02:34.260> backwards<00:02:34.800> let's<00:02:34.950> flip<00:02:35.160> it<00:02:35.310> upside

00:02:35.600 --> 00:02:35.610 
that on backwards let's flip it upside

00:02:35.610 --> 00:02:38.870 
that on backwards let's flip it upside
down<00:02:36.350> want<00:02:37.350> the<00:02:37.500> bend<00:02:37.740> just<00:02:38.310> over<00:02:38.580> the<00:02:38.730> diff

00:02:38.870 --> 00:02:38.880 
down want the bend just over the diff

00:02:38.880 --> 00:02:45.170 
down want the bend just over the diff
cover<00:02:41.660> so<00:02:42.660> we<00:02:42.750> got<00:02:42.900> a<00:02:42.930> nut<00:02:43.170> at<00:02:43.290> the<00:02:43.350> bottom<00:02:44.180> on

00:02:45.170 --> 00:02:45.180
