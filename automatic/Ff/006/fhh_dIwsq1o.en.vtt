00:00:57.680 --> 00:00:57.690 
the trampoline is probably the most

00:00:57.690 --> 00:01:00.080 
the trampoline is probably the most
exhilarating<00:00:58.460> just<00:00:59.460> because<00:00:59.730> your<00:00:59.879> body

00:01:00.080 --> 00:01:00.090 
exhilarating just because your body

00:01:00.090 --> 00:01:01.459 
exhilarating just because your body
doesn't<00:01:00.180> know<00:01:00.510> what's<00:01:00.719> going<00:01:00.780> on<00:01:01.140> and<00:01:01.379> your

00:02:23.880 --> 00:02:23.890 
realize is getting out of the foam pit

00:02:23.890 --> 00:02:26.010 
realize is getting out of the foam pit
it's<00:02:24.190> really<00:02:24.490> difficult<00:02:24.820> you're<00:02:25.660> stuck
