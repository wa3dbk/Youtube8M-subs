somebody with a bladder condition so
like<00:02:51.070> the<00:02:51.250> next<00:02:51.580> thing<00:02:51.820> the<00:02:52.390> next<00:02:52.420> step<00:02:53.380> up

00:02:53.580 --> 00:02:53.590 
like the next thing the next step up

00:02:53.590 --> 00:02:57.660 
like the next thing the next step up
from<00:02:53.800> that<00:02:53.830> would<00:02:54.250> be<00:02:54.400> starches<00:02:55.590> now<00:02:56.590> eating<00:02:57.580> a

00:02:57.660 --> 00:02:57.670 
from that would be starches now eating a

00:02:57.670 --> 00:03:00.750 
from that would be starches now eating a
diet<00:02:57.880> say<00:02:58.690> you<00:02:58.750> replace<00:02:59.320> all<00:02:59.590> fruit<00:03:00.070> with

00:03:04.220 --> 00:03:04.230 
sweet potatoes potatoes things like that

00:03:04.230 --> 00:03:09.210 
sweet potatoes potatoes things like that
squashes<00:03:05.790> the<00:03:06.790> bladder<00:03:07.090> pain<00:03:07.680> stops<00:03:08.680> pretty

00:03:09.210 --> 00:03:09.220 
squashes the bladder pain stops pretty

00:03:09.220 --> 00:03:12.720 
squashes the bladder pain stops pretty
much<00:03:09.430> it's<00:03:10.269> very<00:03:11.010> healing<00:03:12.010> to<00:03:12.370> the<00:03:12.489> bladder

00:03:12.720 --> 00:03:12.730 
much it's very healing to the bladder

00:03:12.730 --> 00:03:15.690 
much it's very healing to the bladder
actually<00:03:13.440> but<00:03:14.440> your<00:03:14.620> digestion<00:03:15.100> may<00:03:15.489> be<00:03:15.549> a

00:03:17.880 --> 00:03:17.890 
little slow and a little off you might

00:03:17.890 --> 00:03:20.880 
little slow and a little off you might
get<00:03:18.790> constipated<00:03:19.630> you<00:03:19.870> might<00:03:20.350> just<00:03:20.680> have

00:03:20.880 --> 00:03:20.890 
get constipated you might just have

00:03:20.890 --> 00:03:25.110 
get constipated you might just have
sharp<00:03:21.519> pains<00:03:21.910> and<00:03:22.860> it's<00:03:23.860> not<00:03:24.220> like<00:03:24.549> the

00:03:25.110 --> 00:03:25.120 
sharp pains and it's not like the

00:03:25.120 --> 00:03:26.910 
sharp pains and it's not like the
perfect<00:03:25.660> diet<00:03:25.870> for<00:03:26.260> everything<00:03:26.739> a

perfect diet for everything a
starch-based<00:03:27.310> diet<00:03:27.910> and<00:03:28.480> especially<00:03:29.470> if<00:03:30.250> your

00:03:30.690 --> 00:03:30.700 
starch-based diet and especially if your

00:03:30.700 --> 00:03:34.110 
starch-based diet and especially if your
adrenals<00:03:31.209> are<00:03:31.420> weak<00:03:32.220> your<00:03:33.220> adrenals<00:03:33.790> produce

00:03:34.110 --> 00:03:34.120 
adrenals are weak your adrenals produce

00:03:34.120 --> 00:03:37.710 
adrenals are weak your adrenals produce
cortisol<00:03:34.660> cortisol<00:03:35.519> helps<00:03:36.519> you<00:03:36.760> utilize

00:03:37.710 --> 00:03:37.720 
cortisol cortisol helps you utilize

00:03:37.720 --> 00:03:40.860 
cortisol cortisol helps you utilize
sugar<00:03:38.380> when<00:03:38.709> you<00:03:38.920> when<00:03:39.670> it's<00:03:39.820> in<00:03:40.030> the<00:03:40.150> cell<00:03:40.420> so

00:03:40.860 --> 00:03:40.870 
sugar when you when it's in the cell so

00:03:40.870 --> 00:03:44.160 
sugar when you when it's in the cell so
if<00:03:41.709> you<00:03:41.920> got<00:03:42.040> weak<00:03:42.340> adrenals<00:03:43.019> overload<00:03:44.019> of

00:03:44.160 --> 00:03:44.170 
if you got weak adrenals overload of

00:03:44.170 --> 00:03:45.960 
if you got weak adrenals overload of
sugar<00:03:44.440> is<00:03:44.680> gonna<00:03:44.890> screw<00:03:45.310> you<00:03:45.489> up<00:03:45.519> you're<00:03:45.880> gonna

00:03:45.960 --> 00:03:45.970 
sugar is gonna screw you up you're gonna

00:03:45.970 --> 00:03:48.569 
sugar is gonna screw you up you're gonna
have<00:03:46.180> blood<00:03:46.450> sugar<00:03:46.750> swings<00:03:47.140> you<00:03:48.100> might<00:03:48.310> have

00:03:48.569 --> 00:03:48.579 
have blood sugar swings you might have

00:03:48.579 --> 00:03:51.660 
have blood sugar swings you might have
like<00:03:49.239> candida<00:03:49.840> overgrowth<00:03:49.959> with<00:03:50.680> parasites

00:03:51.660 --> 00:03:51.670 
like candida overgrowth with parasites

00:03:51.670 --> 00:03:56.789 
like candida overgrowth with parasites
and<00:03:52.120> so<00:03:53.079> for<00:03:53.350> me<00:03:54.870> starches<00:03:55.900> I'll<00:03:56.200> get<00:03:56.590> itchy

00:03:56.789 --> 00:03:56.799 
and so for me starches I'll get itchy

00:03:56.799 --> 00:03:59.610 
and so for me starches I'll get itchy
after<00:03:57.400> I<00:03:57.430> eat<00:03:57.610> starches<00:03:58.209> so<00:03:58.329> like<00:03:58.660> my<00:03:59.200> scalp

00:03:59.610 --> 00:03:59.620 
after I eat starches so like my scalp

00:03:59.620 --> 00:04:02.220 
after I eat starches so like my scalp
will<00:03:59.799> get<00:03:59.980> itchy<00:04:00.160> and<00:04:00.519> it's<00:04:00.700> like<00:04:01.049> what<00:04:02.049> the

00:04:02.220 --> 00:04:02.230 
will get itchy and it's like what the

00:04:02.230 --> 00:04:04.530 
will get itchy and it's like what the
hell's<00:04:02.440> going<00:04:02.829> on<00:04:02.980> little<00:04:03.370> bugs<00:04:03.730> crawling<00:04:04.269> all

00:04:04.530 --> 00:04:04.540 
hell's going on little bugs crawling all

00:04:04.540 --> 00:04:06.920 
hell's going on little bugs crawling all
over<00:04:04.570> me<00:04:05.079> and<00:04:05.320> oh<00:04:05.560> my<00:04:06.250> god

00:04:06.920 --> 00:04:06.930 
over me and oh my god

00:04:06.930 --> 00:04:10.449 
over me and oh my god
I<00:04:06.989> don't<00:04:07.799> even<00:04:07.859> want<00:04:08.099> to<00:04:08.189> think<00:04:08.430> about<00:04:08.549> it<00:04:09.079> so

00:04:10.449 --> 00:04:10.459 
I don't even want to think about it so

00:04:10.459 --> 00:04:12.920 
I don't even want to think about it so
starches<00:04:11.459> are<00:04:11.609> not<00:04:11.790> cool<00:04:12.060> like<00:04:12.359> fruit<00:04:12.659> doesn't

00:04:12.920 --> 00:04:12.930 
starches are not cool like fruit doesn't

00:04:12.930 --> 00:04:15.129 
starches are not cool like fruit doesn't
do<00:04:13.170> that<00:04:13.319> to<00:04:13.590> me<00:04:13.709> so<00:04:13.980> it's<00:04:14.159> something<00:04:14.549> about

00:04:15.129 --> 00:04:15.139 
do that to me so it's something about

00:04:15.139 --> 00:04:18.830 
do that to me so it's something about
the<00:04:16.139> starch<00:04:16.560> it's<00:04:16.829> a<00:04:16.919> lot<00:04:17.130> more<00:04:17.459> sugar<00:04:17.840> than

00:04:18.830 --> 00:04:18.840 
the starch it's a lot more sugar than

00:04:18.840 --> 00:04:20.719 
the starch it's a lot more sugar than
the<00:04:19.079> fruit<00:04:19.410> even<00:04:19.650> though<00:04:19.949> the<00:04:20.130> fruit<00:04:20.370> tastes

00:04:20.719 --> 00:04:20.729 
the fruit even though the fruit tastes

00:04:20.729 --> 00:04:23.090 
the fruit even though the fruit tastes
sweet<00:04:21.090> it's<00:04:21.389> much<00:04:21.630> easier<00:04:22.109> to<00:04:22.320> digest<00:04:22.440> fruit

00:04:23.090 --> 00:04:23.100 
sweet it's much easier to digest fruit

00:04:23.100 --> 00:04:26.960 
sweet it's much easier to digest fruit
than<00:04:23.340> it<00:04:23.490> is<00:04:23.639> starch<00:04:24.470> so<00:04:25.470> like<00:04:26.160> neither<00:04:26.520> diet

00:04:26.960 --> 00:04:26.970 
than it is starch so like neither diet

00:04:26.970 --> 00:04:29.719 
than it is starch so like neither diet
is<00:04:27.180> perfect<00:04:27.750> the<00:04:27.870> fruit<00:04:28.229> or<00:04:28.740> the<00:04:28.800> starch<00:04:29.400> based

00:04:29.719 --> 00:04:29.729 
is perfect the fruit or the starch based

00:04:29.729 --> 00:04:34.550 
is perfect the fruit or the starch based
diet<00:04:30.060> now<00:04:31.020> what<00:04:31.620> is<00:04:31.770> my<00:04:31.979> option<00:04:32.639> is<00:04:33.229> the<00:04:34.229> next

00:04:34.550 --> 00:04:34.560 
diet now what is my option is the next

00:04:34.560 --> 00:04:38.240 
diet now what is my option is the next
step<00:04:35.310> would<00:04:35.550> be<00:04:35.610> a<00:04:35.759> fat<00:04:36.180> based<00:04:36.630> diet<00:04:37.020> now<00:04:38.009> this

00:04:38.240 --> 00:04:38.250 
step would be a fat based diet now this

00:04:38.250 --> 00:04:41.810 
step would be a fat based diet now this
is<00:04:38.460> your<00:04:38.759> avocados<00:04:39.539> nuts<00:04:39.990> and<00:04:40.349> seeds<00:04:40.680> coconuts

00:04:41.810 --> 00:04:41.820 
is your avocados nuts and seeds coconuts

00:04:41.820 --> 00:04:45.350 
is your avocados nuts and seeds coconuts
