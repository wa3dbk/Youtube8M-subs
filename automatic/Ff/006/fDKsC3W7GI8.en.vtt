00:02:06.990 --> 00:02:13.590
 well I was just saying that with objects 

00:02:09.690 --> 00:02:16.040
 they replaced them and if I do some 

00:02:13.590 --> 00:02:16.040
 to see 

00:02:17.770 --> 00:02:21.900
 they mostly changed the sandstone 

00:02:22.740 --> 00:02:30.210
 now I like this one here 

00:02:28.120 --> 00:02:32.590
 normal 

00:02:30.210 --> 00:02:38.350
 here this sandstone has changed here 

00:02:32.590 --> 00:02:41.130
 more than anything else I put this or bad 

00:02:38.350 --> 00:02:41.130
 only serves more 

00:02:41.650 --> 00:02:46.900
 especially good in particular have 

00:02:44.320 --> 00:02:49.930
 changed theses armor I make you 

00:02:46.900 --> 00:02:54.190
 see the icons a bit like they are here 

00:02:49.930 --> 00:02:59.290
 here they have the hobo sarasso cia 

00:02:54.190 --> 00:03:03.460
 just his armor the leather iron 

00:02:59.290 --> 00:03:05.890
 diamond and gold I show it as it is with 

00:03:03.460 --> 00:03:11.710
 he wears for what I have to put in 

00:03:05.890 --> 00:03:15.010
 game mode zero ie survival aia e 

00:03:11.710 --> 00:03:21.550
 forgot that I was in the air 

00:03:15.010 --> 00:03:23.740
 here it is, it looks like the blocks 

00:03:21.550 --> 00:03:30.459
 own diamond 

00:03:23.740 --> 00:03:38.770
 same thing for gold ones is okay me 

00:03:30.459 --> 00:03:42.880
 I put in creative 1 ok the mobs are not 

00:03:38.770 --> 00:03:47.590
 always changed the same 

00:03:42.880 --> 00:03:49.450
 here the zombie zombie villagers do not have them 

00:03:47.590 --> 00:03:52.030
 still seen though I guess that too 

00:03:49.450 --> 00:03:54.220
 those have changed 

00:03:52.030 --> 00:03:58.900
 here's how you can see the glass I do n't know 

00:03:54.220 --> 00:04:00.250
 what they did but they put that though 

00:03:58.900 --> 00:04:04.390
 you put your feet one becomes that 

00:04:00.250 --> 00:04:05.950
 giant stron from the star or that here 

00:04:04.390 --> 00:04:11.500
 it seems that there are only stakes 

00:04:05.950 --> 00:04:15.970
 of wood and instead this and glass that 

00:04:11.500 --> 00:04:18.910
 like the they are realistic 

00:04:15.970 --> 00:04:24.210
 these are perfect less then seen 

00:04:18.910 --> 00:04:24.210
 inside look here 

00:04:24.600 --> 00:04:31.380
 or here here is to see here not 

00:04:29.760 --> 00:04:34.740
 see for example the edges of others 

00:04:31.380 --> 00:04:39.930
 of the other single glasses but all the 

00:04:34.740 --> 00:04:41.790
 the whole window because you want it 

00:04:39.930 --> 00:04:47.670
 to do that in its shops with shop windows 

00:04:41.790 --> 00:04:53.280
 these are perfect or later than others 

00:04:47.670 --> 00:05:00.450
 changes have put a little to me 

00:04:53.280 --> 00:05:03.210
 there are no other glasses or other things 

00:05:00.450 --> 00:05:04.830
 I'll show you the plates instead of 

00:05:03.210 --> 00:05:12.660
 how they made glass 

00:05:04.830 --> 00:05:15.620
 here they are and they wanted to do so yes 

00:05:12.660 --> 00:05:15.620
 always washed the same 

00:05:18.030 --> 00:05:23.520
 ok let me show you make a comparison 

00:05:21.390 --> 00:05:32.240
 with my armor with the block of 

00:05:23.520 --> 00:05:39.080
 diamond right on the plate here furnished 

00:05:32.240 --> 00:05:39.080
 identical exactly the same 

00:05:39.750 --> 00:05:45.830
 ok 

00:05:41.420 --> 00:05:49.160
 after this tell you that soon 

00:05:45.830 --> 00:05:52.460
 the big guys from oblivion will come back as well 

00:05:49.160 --> 00:05:56.030
 the others will fallout instead 

00:05:52.460 --> 00:05:59.680
 expansions that I hope are not 

00:05:56.030 --> 00:06:04.610
 so I don't think they are that long of 

00:05:59.680 --> 00:06:10.930
 enjoy longer fashion ship z ma 

00:06:04.610 --> 00:06:14.510
 oh well even if they are nothing 

00:06:10.930 --> 00:06:21.610
 well then that's it 

00:06:14.510 --> 00:06:21.610
 bye bye stupid little one
