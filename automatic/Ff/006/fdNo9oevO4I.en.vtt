style<00:02:36.320> the<00:02:36.620> ATI<00:02:37.900> coolers<00:02:38.900> on<00:02:39.080> here<00:02:39.410> at<00:02:39.860> the

00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:40.010 
style the ATI coolers on here at the

style the ATI coolers on here at the
back<00:02:40.190> forcing<00:02:40.730> air<00:02:40.850> through<00:02:40.880> here<00:02:41.390> but<00:02:41.930> now

00:02:42.039 --> 00:02:42.049 
back forcing air through here but now

00:02:42.049 --> 00:02:44.140 
back forcing air through here but now
this<00:02:42.170> is<00:02:42.320> only<00:02:42.440> a<00:02:42.530> single<00:02:42.739> GPU<00:02:43.220> solution<00:02:43.820> so

00:02:44.140 --> 00:02:44.150 
this is only a single GPU solution so

00:02:44.150 --> 00:02:46.539 
this is only a single GPU solution so
nothing<00:02:45.019> really<00:02:45.049> to<00:02:45.380> say<00:02:45.440> about<00:02:45.950> some<00:02:46.370> of<00:02:46.459> the

00:02:46.539 --> 00:02:46.549 
nothing really to say about some of the

00:02:48.190 --> 00:02:48.200 
other cards that have the two GPUs and

00:02:48.200 --> 00:02:50.800 
other cards that have the two GPUs and
get<00:02:48.440> kind<00:02:49.010> of<00:02:49.040> inadequate<00:02:49.670> cooling<00:02:50.390> on<00:02:50.510> one<00:02:50.690> or

00:03:02.660 --> 00:03:05.110 
port and we got to DV is now one real
tricky<00:03:03.110> thing<00:03:03.350> about<00:03:03.380> this<00:03:03.739> guy<00:03:03.920> is<00:03:03.980> you<00:03:04.850> need

00:03:05.110 --> 00:03:05.120 
tricky thing about this guy is you need

00:03:05.120 --> 00:03:07.330 
tricky thing about this guy is you need
an<00:03:05.720> adapter<00:03:06.380> that<00:03:06.500> does<00:03:06.680> not<00:03:06.860> come<00:03:07.070> with<00:03:07.250> the

however really nice card I cannot wait
to<00:04:27.520> try<00:04:27.760> this<00:04:27.820> out<00:04:28.060> I<00:04:28.300> will<00:04:29.110> bring<00:04:29.350> down

00:04:29.460 --> 00:04:29.470 
to try this out I will bring down

00:04:29.470 --> 00:04:31.560 
to try this out I will bring down
computer<00:04:30.100> and<00:04:30.310> maybe<00:04:30.670> add<00:04:30.910> that<00:04:31.090> to<00:04:31.210> the<00:04:31.300> video
