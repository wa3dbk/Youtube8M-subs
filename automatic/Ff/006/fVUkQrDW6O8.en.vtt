sanding sponge looks like it's basically
a<00:00:24.840> sponge<00:00:25.320> and<00:00:25.710> it's<00:00:25.859> got<00:00:26.010> sandpaper<00:00:26.519> on<00:00:26.670> it

00:00:26.870 --> 00:00:26.880 
a sponge and it's got sandpaper on it

00:00:26.880 --> 00:00:28.759 
a sponge and it's got sandpaper on it
what<00:00:27.000> I<00:00:27.029> really<00:00:27.420> like<00:00:27.630> about<00:00:27.660> this<00:00:28.170> is<00:00:28.560> it's

00:00:28.759 --> 00:00:28.769 
what I really like about this is it's

00:00:28.769 --> 00:00:32.749 
what I really like about this is it's
easy<00:00:29.130> to<00:00:29.340> hold<00:00:30.269> first<00:00:30.840> of<00:00:31.080> all<00:00:31.199> and<00:00:31.560> it's<00:00:32.460> easy

00:00:32.749 --> 00:00:32.759 
easy to hold first of all and it's easy

00:00:32.759 --> 00:00:35.930 
easy to hold first of all and it's easy
to<00:00:32.910> work<00:00:33.210> around<00:00:33.390> the<00:00:33.660> corners<00:00:34.050> this<00:00:34.260> is<00:00:34.590> a<00:00:34.940> 220

00:00:35.930 --> 00:00:35.940 
to work around the corners this is a 220

00:00:35.940 --> 00:00:41.060 
to work around the corners this is a 220
grit<00:00:36.050> and<00:00:37.050> so<00:00:37.950> basically<00:00:38.670> this<00:00:39.660> will<00:00:40.140> sand

00:00:41.060 --> 00:00:41.070 
grit and so basically this will sand

00:00:41.070 --> 00:00:44.180 
grit and so basically this will sand
your<00:00:41.969> piece<00:00:42.300> and<00:00:42.750> just<00:00:42.930> kind<00:00:43.200> of<00:00:43.290> smooth<00:00:43.800> it

00:00:44.180 --> 00:00:44.190 
your piece and just kind of smooth it

00:00:44.190 --> 00:00:47.740 
your piece and just kind of smooth it
out<00:00:44.250> and<00:00:44.610> you'll<00:00:44.820> get<00:00:45.120> that<00:00:45.360> nice<00:00:45.750> smooth<00:00:46.320> feel

00:00:47.740 --> 00:00:47.750 
out and you'll get that nice smooth feel

00:00:47.750 --> 00:00:51.020 
out and you'll get that nice smooth feel
after<00:00:48.750> you've<00:00:49.050> done<00:00:49.289> painful<00:00:49.950> this<00:00:50.489> isn't

00:00:51.020 --> 00:00:51.030

use<00:00:52.770> to<00:00:54.620> distress<00:00:55.620> to<00:00:56.550> get<00:00:56.730> the<00:00:56.940> corners<00:00:57.629> and

00:00:57.889 --> 00:00:57.899 
use to distress to get the corners and

00:00:57.899 --> 00:01:01.639 
use to distress to get the corners and
edges<00:00:58.020> looking<00:00:58.859> worn<00:00:59.250> or<00:00:59.609> anything<00:01:00.590> like<00:01:01.590> that
