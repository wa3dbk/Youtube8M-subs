00:00:51.830 --> 00:00:51.840 
inside the refrigerator the refrigerator

00:00:51.840 --> 00:00:54.020 
inside the refrigerator the refrigerator
doesn't<00:00:52.620> have<00:00:52.739> any<00:00:52.920> moving<00:00:53.250> parts<00:00:53.309> in<00:00:53.730> it<00:00:53.850> the

section<00:01:00.030> so<00:01:00.359> I<00:01:00.390> need<00:01:00.629> to<00:01:00.690> look<00:01:00.809> at<00:01:00.960> the<00:01:01.050> fan<00:01:01.320> and

00:01:01.639 --> 00:01:01.649 
section so I need to look at the fan and

00:01:01.649 --> 00:01:03.680 
section so I need to look at the fan and
the<00:01:01.920> evaporator<00:01:02.430> and<00:01:02.730> see<00:01:03.210> if<00:01:03.270> I<00:01:03.359> see<00:01:03.539> they

00:01:03.680 --> 00:01:03.690 
the evaporator and see if I see they

00:01:03.690 --> 00:01:06.260 
the evaporator and see if I see they
looks<00:01:03.899> out<00:01:04.019> of<00:01:04.049> the<00:01:04.170> ordinary<00:01:04.559> and<00:01:05.060> go<00:01:06.060> from

00:01:06.260 --> 00:01:06.270 
looks out of the ordinary and go from

00:01:06.270 --> 00:01:07.820 
looks out of the ordinary and go from
there<00:01:06.479> so<00:01:06.689> fortunate<00:01:07.439> is<00:01:07.560> you<00:01:07.650> need<00:01:07.799> a

00:01:07.820 --> 00:01:07.830 
there so fortunate is you need a

00:01:07.830 --> 00:01:15.719 
there so fortunate is you need a
quarter-inch<00:01:08.250> driver<00:01:08.700> to<00:01:09.150> remove<00:01:09.240> the<00:01:09.510> screws

00:01:15.719 --> 00:01:15.729 

00:01:15.729 --> 00:01:17.899 

and<00:01:15.939> like<00:01:16.390> this<00:01:16.570> model<00:01:16.840> for<00:01:17.140> instance<00:01:17.439> has<00:01:17.650> a

00:01:17.899 --> 00:01:17.909 
and like this model for instance has a

00:01:17.909 --> 00:01:20.580 
and like this model for instance has a
icemaker<00:01:18.909> plug<00:01:19.420> it<00:01:19.780> does<00:01:20.200> not<00:01:20.350> have<00:01:20.500> an

00:01:20.580 --> 00:01:20.590 
icemaker plug it does not have an

00:01:20.590 --> 00:01:21.990 
icemaker plug it does not have an
icemaker<00:01:20.890> in<00:01:21.189> it<00:01:21.310> so<00:01:21.430> you've<00:01:21.549> got<00:01:21.640> to<00:01:21.759> get<00:01:21.850> the

00:01:21.990 --> 00:01:22.000 
icemaker in it so you've got to get the

00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:24.149 
icemaker in it so you've got to get the
plug<00:01:22.240> out<00:01:22.540> of<00:01:22.600> the<00:01:22.869> back<00:01:23.110> wall<00:01:23.380> and<00:01:23.710> push<00:01:24.009> it

00:02:15.819 --> 00:02:17.910 
got frost in the front half of the
actual<00:02:16.510> evaporator<00:02:16.959> the<00:02:17.110> back<00:02:17.319> half<00:02:17.620> of<00:02:17.769> it

00:02:17.910 --> 00:02:17.920 
actual evaporator the back half of it

00:02:17.920 --> 00:02:20.759 
actual evaporator the back half of it
it's<00:02:18.549> still<00:02:18.730> not<00:02:18.910> frozen<00:02:19.150> solid<00:02:19.690> yet<00:02:19.870> so<00:02:20.320> it<00:02:20.620> is

00:02:20.759 --> 00:02:20.769 
it's still not frozen solid yet so it is

00:02:20.769 --> 00:02:23.390 
it's still not frozen solid yet so it is
it<00:02:21.370> is<00:02:21.850> starting<00:02:22.150> to<00:02:22.180> cool<00:02:22.420> back<00:02:22.540> down<00:02:22.600> again

00:02:23.390 --> 00:02:23.400 
it is starting to cool back down again

00:02:23.400 --> 00:02:25.289 
it is starting to cool back down again
so<00:02:24.400> what<00:02:24.489> I'm<00:02:24.579> going<00:02:24.700> to<00:02:24.730> do<00:02:24.820> now<00:02:24.970> is<00:02:25.090> I'm<00:02:25.209> just

00:02:25.289 --> 00:02:25.299 
so what I'm going to do now is I'm just

00:02:25.299 --> 00:02:27.210 
so what I'm going to do now is I'm just
going<00:02:25.510> to<00:02:25.540> turn<00:02:25.989> the<00:02:26.079> power<00:02:26.230> off<00:02:26.380> I'm<00:02:26.980> going<00:02:27.160> to

00:02:27.210 --> 00:02:27.220 
going to turn the power off I'm going to

00:02:27.220 --> 00:02:29.610 
going to turn the power off I'm going to
take<00:02:27.700> a<00:02:27.730> look<00:02:27.970> at<00:02:28.030> the<00:02:28.120> fan<00:02:28.390> to<00:02:28.989> make<00:02:29.170> sure<00:02:29.440> that

00:02:29.610 --> 00:02:29.620 
take a look at the fan to make sure that

00:02:29.620 --> 00:02:32.190 
take a look at the fan to make sure that
one<00:02:29.980> the<00:02:30.910> family<00:02:31.269> has<00:02:31.390> not<00:02:31.510> moved<00:02:31.780> itself

00:02:32.190 --> 00:02:32.200 
one the family has not moved itself

00:02:32.200 --> 00:02:34.170 
one the family has not moved itself
forward<00:02:32.530> on<00:02:32.799> the<00:02:33.070> shaft<00:02:33.340> from<00:02:33.579> the<00:02:33.700> motor<00:02:33.940> and

00:02:34.170 --> 00:02:34.180 
forward on the shaft from the motor and

00:02:34.180 --> 00:02:37.920 
forward on the shaft from the motor and
causing<00:02:35.140> a<00:02:35.200> rubbing<00:02:35.500> noise<00:02:35.880> and<00:02:36.880> we<00:02:37.780> could

00:02:37.920 --> 00:02:37.930 
causing a rubbing noise and we could

00:02:37.930 --> 00:02:40.140 
causing a rubbing noise and we could
also<00:02:38.140> have<00:02:38.350> the<00:02:39.280> unit<00:02:39.579> does<00:02:39.790> have<00:02:39.820> a<00:02:40.030> little

00:02:40.140 --> 00:02:40.150 
also have the unit does have a little

00:02:40.150 --> 00:02:41.880 
also have the unit does have a little
bit<00:02:40.269> of<00:02:40.359> icicles<00:02:41.019> hanging<00:02:41.170> from<00:02:41.350> the<00:02:41.500> top<00:02:41.680> of

00:02:41.880 --> 00:02:41.890 
bit of icicles hanging from the top of

00:02:41.890 --> 00:02:45.660 
bit of icicles hanging from the top of
the<00:02:41.950> freezer<00:02:42.930> which<00:02:43.930> those<00:02:44.170> icicles<00:02:44.920> could<00:02:45.489> be

00:02:45.660 --> 00:02:45.670 
the freezer which those icicles could be

00:02:45.670 --> 00:02:47.460 
the freezer which those icicles could be
hot<00:02:45.880> air<00:02:46.120> getting<00:02:46.329> in<00:02:46.570> and<00:02:46.780> getting<00:02:46.810> back<00:02:47.200> on

00:02:47.460 --> 00:02:47.470 
hot air getting in and getting back on

00:02:47.470 --> 00:02:49.470 
hot air getting in and getting back on
the<00:02:47.620> fan<00:02:47.859> blade<00:02:48.100> and<00:02:48.400> could<00:02:48.670> be<00:02:48.760> causing<00:02:49.269> it<00:02:49.329> to

00:02:49.470 --> 00:02:49.480 
the fan blade and could be causing it to

00:02:49.480 --> 00:02:51.180 
the fan blade and could be causing it to
make<00:02:49.630> noise<00:02:49.870> okay<00:02:50.620> so<00:02:50.680> what<00:02:50.829> I'm<00:02:50.920> going<00:02:51.010> to<00:02:51.070> do

00:02:54.509 --> 00:02:54.519 
wiring harness in the back of the

00:02:54.519 --> 00:02:56.970 
wiring harness in the back of the
freezer<00:02:54.959> because<00:02:55.959> all<00:02:56.320> that's<00:02:56.500> doing<00:02:56.590> is<00:02:56.799> it's

00:03:28.220 --> 00:03:28.230 
because it does have tabs on the top

00:03:28.230 --> 00:03:34.330 
because it does have tabs on the top
that<00:03:28.620> you<00:03:28.680> don't<00:03:28.980> get<00:03:29.159> to<00:03:29.360> take<00:03:30.360> off<00:03:31.549> and<00:03:32.549> over

and the fan blade on this unit was

00:03:38.340 --> 00:03:40.850 
and the fan blade on this unit was
slipped<00:03:38.700> forward<00:03:38.909> slightly<00:03:39.709> could<00:03:40.709> be<00:03:40.829> a

the fan blade back to where it's

00:03:44.970 --> 00:03:46.759 
the fan blade back to where it's
supposed<00:03:45.000> to<00:03:45.239> be<00:03:45.420> I'm<00:03:45.930> going<00:03:46.110> to<00:03:46.170> re<00:03:46.349> insert

00:03:46.759 --> 00:03:46.769 
supposed to be I'm going to re insert

00:03:46.769 --> 00:03:50.470 
supposed to be I'm going to re insert
