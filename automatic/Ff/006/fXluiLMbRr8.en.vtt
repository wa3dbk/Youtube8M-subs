00:00:05.569 --> 00:00:10.080
 All people will be back 

00:00:08.189 --> 00:00:14.490
 and today we have a drink in 

00:00:10.080 --> 00:00:16.680
 an insane color and indeed have 

00:00:14.490 --> 00:00:18.480
 I think about how to do it a bit 

00:00:16.680 --> 00:00:20.250
 can spice up his drink 

00:00:18.480 --> 00:00:23.160
 Juice spritzes I drink for example 

00:00:20.250 --> 00:00:25.109
 super great but it is so 

00:00:23.160 --> 00:00:26.400
 a kind of premium juice spritzer it is 

00:00:25.109 --> 00:00:28.529
 something special in it 

00:00:26.400 --> 00:00:31.080
 It gives the drinks a special kick 

00:00:28.529 --> 00:00:33.140
 and what I am quite surprised net 

00:00:31.080 --> 00:00:39.210
 has put that is the combination 

00:00:33.140 --> 00:00:41.430
 mango and mint super super good tastes 

00:00:39.210 --> 00:00:42.899
 and I drank it once I know 

00:00:41.430 --> 00:00:45.239
 not whether the child in Hans in luck the 

00:00:42.899 --> 00:00:47.489
 have such a mango with scarf and me 

00:00:45.239 --> 00:00:49.020
 I'm totally excited about it and I have 

00:00:47.489 --> 00:00:50.700
 thought human at home i have mint 

00:00:49.020 --> 00:00:51.210
 I have mango juice this is mango here 

00:00:50.700 --> 00:00:53.879
 Apple 

00:00:51.210 --> 00:00:55.850
 there is also mango pure and from it 

00:00:53.879 --> 00:00:57.870
 try the delicious scenic 

00:00:55.850 --> 00:00:59.760
 Ice cubes usually also belong 

00:00:57.870 --> 00:01:02.160
 to which I have today not because the 

00:00:59.760 --> 00:01:04.559
 But you can also enter with it 

00:01:02.160 --> 00:01:07.200
 glass some mint and I have because I 

00:01:04.559 --> 00:01:09.360
 just do the mint rows then get it 

00:01:07.200 --> 00:01:13.110
 the juice is not that aroma that's why 

00:01:09.360 --> 00:01:15.119
 I have mint here almost in 

00:01:13.110 --> 00:01:16.799
 his glass done with boiling water 

00:01:15.119 --> 00:01:20.880
 I have a kind now 

00:01:16.799 --> 00:01:23.250
 fresh mint tea here I do 

00:01:20.880 --> 00:01:30.509
 a little bit here so that, so to speak 

00:01:23.250 --> 00:01:32.850
 One has the smell that and so on 

00:01:30.509 --> 00:01:34.650
 but we want it sparkling we have 

00:01:32.850 --> 00:01:38.040
 want to have it fresh and for her 

00:01:34.650 --> 00:01:39.900
 that is why mineral water is also used 

00:01:38.040 --> 00:01:42.899
 how do we do the subject until we take it 

00:01:39.900 --> 00:01:44.310
 us here such a nice piece of mint that 

00:01:42.899 --> 00:01:47.850
 should also look good because that 

00:01:44.310 --> 00:01:49.049
 stay in the juice first mango us 

00:01:47.850 --> 00:01:49.680
 make a third of a third 

00:01:49.049 --> 00:01:53.509
 one-third 

00:01:49.680 --> 00:01:56.119
 so that it is already fruity so 

00:01:53.509 --> 00:01:59.880
 now comes the fresh 

00:01:56.119 --> 00:02:02.729
 now give the ice cubes and now 

00:01:59.880 --> 00:02:04.890
 the winemaker comes and I think that's it 

00:02:02.729 --> 00:02:07.720
 very important to have so 

00:02:04.890 --> 00:02:10.149
 even her aroma releases that is whole 

00:02:07.720 --> 00:02:11.740
 engrave and now you can do that with one 

00:02:10.149 --> 00:02:15.070
 straw for example, if it still 

00:02:11.740 --> 00:02:17.200
 Serve you and then you have 

00:02:15.070 --> 00:02:19.090
 Keep a fresh summer drink 

00:02:17.200 --> 00:02:22.050
 little more than a normal one 

00:02:19.090 --> 00:02:22.050
 juice spritzer
