00:01:04.199 --> 00:01:05.960 
amount right but could they do the same
thing<00:01:04.440> this<00:01:04.559> this<00:01:05.040> time<00:01:05.280> around<00:01:05.309> to<00:01:05.700> where

00:01:33.860 --> 00:01:33.870 
point that you were making about the

00:01:33.870 --> 00:01:35.930 
point that you were making about the
dollar<00:01:34.170> becoming<00:01:34.650> worthless<00:01:35.070> they<00:01:35.280> also<00:01:35.430> say

00:01:35.930 --> 00:01:35.940 
dollar becoming worthless they also say

00:01:35.940 --> 00:01:37.670 
dollar becoming worthless they also say
that<00:01:36.210> they're<00:01:36.690> going<00:01:36.810> to<00:01:36.870> go<00:01:37.050> back<00:01:37.230> on<00:01:37.410> a<00:01:37.440> gold

00:01:37.670 --> 00:01:37.680 
that they're going to go back on a gold

00:01:37.680 --> 00:01:39.890 
that they're going to go back on a gold
standard<00:01:37.770> but<00:01:38.370> it<00:01:38.550> some<00:01:38.880> high<00:01:39.330> enough<00:01:39.600> number

00:01:39.890 --> 00:01:39.900 
standard but it some high enough number

00:01:39.900 --> 00:01:41.930 
standard but it some high enough number
to<00:01:39.930> make<00:01:40.200> a<00:01:40.230> gold<00:01:40.560> standard<00:01:40.830> plausible<00:01:41.640> yeah

00:01:41.930 --> 00:01:41.940 
to make a gold standard plausible yeah

00:01:41.940 --> 00:01:44.060 
to make a gold standard plausible yeah
which<00:01:42.270> would<00:01:42.420> be<00:01:42.540> you<00:01:42.720> know<00:01:42.810> in<00:01:43.110> my<00:01:43.290> mind<00:01:43.470> five

00:01:44.060 --> 00:01:44.070 
which would be you know in my mind five

00:01:44.070 --> 00:01:45.710 
which would be you know in my mind five
or<00:01:44.280> six<00:01:44.670> or<00:01:44.820> eight<00:01:44.940> thousand<00:01:45.360> dollars<00:01:45.570> an

00:01:45.710 --> 00:01:45.720 
or six or eight thousand dollars an

00:01:45.720 --> 00:01:47.960 
or six or eight thousand dollars an
ounce<00:01:45.840> I<00:01:46.170> did<00:01:46.950> a<00:01:46.980> study<00:01:47.280> when<00:01:47.550> I<00:01:47.580> was<00:01:47.760> writing

00:01:47.960 --> 00:01:47.970 
ounce I did a study when I was writing

00:01:47.970 --> 00:01:50.090 
ounce I did a study when I was writing
the<00:01:48.180> book<00:01:48.210> to<00:01:48.840> see<00:01:49.320> what<00:01:49.560> it<00:01:49.650> would<00:01:49.740> take<00:01:50.070> to

00:01:50.090 --> 00:01:50.100 
the book to see what it would take to

00:01:50.100 --> 00:01:54.050 
the book to see what it would take to
make<00:01:50.490> a<00:01:50.990> Breton<00:01:51.990> wooden<00:01:52.380> what<00:01:53.010> is<00:01:53.250> the<00:01:53.520> least

00:01:54.050 --> 00:01:54.060 
make a Breton wooden what is the least

00:01:54.060 --> 00:01:56.030 
make a Breton wooden what is the least
amount<00:01:54.360> of<00:01:54.510> dollars<00:01:54.720> that<00:01:55.200> the<00:01:55.350> US<00:01:55.710> could

00:01:56.030 --> 00:01:56.040 
amount of dollars that the US could

00:01:56.040 --> 00:02:00.260 
amount of dollars that the US could
cover<00:01:56.840> to<00:01:57.840> give<00:01:58.080> see<00:01:58.800> I<00:01:58.830> think<00:01:59.190> if<00:01:59.850> the<00:02:00.090> dollar

00:02:00.260 --> 00:02:00.270 
cover to give see I think if the dollar

00:02:00.270 --> 00:02:02.090 
cover to give see I think if the dollar
was<00:02:00.600> going<00:02:00.960> into<00:02:01.080> a<00:02:01.170> hyperinflation<00:02:01.560> or

00:02:02.090 --> 00:02:02.100 
was going into a hyperinflation or

00:02:02.100 --> 00:02:03.230 
was going into a hyperinflation or
something<00:02:02.370> like<00:02:02.460> that<00:02:02.520> that<00:02:02.700> they<00:02:02.940> would<00:02:03.060> have

00:02:03.230 --> 00:02:03.240 
something like that that they would have

00:02:03.240 --> 00:02:04.730 
something like that that they would have
to<00:02:03.390> go<00:02:03.510> back<00:02:03.660> on<00:02:03.870> to<00:02:03.990> a<00:02:04.020> gold<00:02:04.260> standard<00:02:04.350> because

00:02:04.730 --> 00:02:04.740 
to go back on to a gold standard because

00:02:04.740 --> 00:02:06.860 
to go back on to a gold standard because
all<00:02:05.100> world<00:02:05.370> trade<00:02:05.670> we<00:02:05.850> broke<00:02:06.060> down<00:02:06.330> yeah<00:02:06.840> i

in the ocean in the

00:02:11.780 --> 00:02:15.699 
in the ocean in the
duh<00:02:11.980> and<00:02:12.980> so<00:02:13.480> in<00:02:14.480> order<00:02:14.690> to<00:02:14.840> give<00:02:15.110> the<00:02:15.350> Dalek

00:02:17.470 --> 00:02:17.480 
people faith in the dollar they'd have

00:02:17.480 --> 00:02:19.990 
people faith in the dollar they'd have
to<00:02:17.690> go<00:02:18.319> back<00:02:18.500> on<00:02:18.740> some<00:02:19.010> sort<00:02:19.190> of<00:02:19.280> gold<00:02:19.520> standard

00:02:19.990 --> 00:02:20.000 
to go back on some sort of gold standard

00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:21.130 
to go back on some sort of gold standard
now<00:02:20.120> I<00:02:20.150> was<00:02:20.270> thinking<00:02:20.600> what's<00:02:20.810> the<00:02:20.959> least

00:02:21.130 --> 00:02:21.140 
now I was thinking what's the least

00:02:21.140 --> 00:02:23.400 
now I was thinking what's the least
amount<00:02:21.350> of<00:02:21.590> dollars<00:02:21.800> that<00:02:22.130> they<00:02:22.190> can<00:02:22.490> cover

00:02:23.400 --> 00:02:23.410 
amount of dollars that they can cover

00:02:23.410 --> 00:02:27.400 
amount of dollars that they can cover
and<00:02:24.410> sort<00:02:24.709> of<00:02:24.770> cheat<00:02:25.130> gold<00:02:25.730> you<00:02:26.600> know<00:02:26.690> I<00:02:26.930> still

00:02:27.400 --> 00:02:27.410 
and sort of cheat gold you know I still

00:02:27.410 --> 00:02:29.979 
and sort of cheat gold you know I still
inspire<00:02:28.010> confidence<00:02:28.280> in<00:02:28.730> the<00:02:28.850> dollar<00:02:29.060> and<00:02:29.270> I

00:02:29.979 --> 00:02:29.989 
inspire confidence in the dollar and I

00:02:29.989 --> 00:02:31.390 
inspire confidence in the dollar and I
figured<00:02:30.319> it<00:02:30.410> would<00:02:30.500> be<00:02:30.530> a<00:02:30.620> Bretton<00:02:30.950> Woods<00:02:30.980> type

00:02:31.390 --> 00:02:31.400 
figured it would be a Bretton Woods type

00:02:31.400 --> 00:02:32.949 
figured it would be a Bretton Woods type
system<00:02:31.850> where<00:02:32.000> it<00:02:32.090> was<00:02:32.209> all<00:02:32.450> of<00:02:32.569> the<00:02:32.690> dollars

00:02:32.949 --> 00:02:32.959 
system where it was all of the dollars

00:02:32.959 --> 00:02:36.010 
system where it was all of the dollars
held<00:02:33.170> by<00:02:33.319> foreign<00:02:33.650> central<00:02:33.980> banks<00:02:34.069> so<00:02:34.700> I<00:02:35.020> found

00:02:36.010 --> 00:02:36.020 
held by foreign central banks so I found

00:02:36.020 --> 00:02:38.140 
held by foreign central banks so I found
out<00:02:36.170> how<00:02:36.380> many<00:02:36.440> dollars<00:02:37.069> Horn<00:02:37.489> said<00:02:37.580> the<00:02:37.819> banks

00:02:38.140 --> 00:02:38.150 
out how many dollars Horn said the banks

00:02:38.150 --> 00:02:40.000 
out how many dollars Horn said the banks
were<00:02:38.300> holding<00:02:39.110> and<00:02:39.290> divided<00:02:39.650> that<00:02:39.770> by<00:02:39.830> the

00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:40.010 
were holding and divided that by the

00:02:40.010 --> 00:02:41.860 
were holding and divided that by the
ounces<00:02:40.370> of<00:02:40.520> gold<00:02:40.700> of<00:02:40.819> the<00:02:40.880> tread<00:02:41.150> supposedly

00:02:41.860 --> 00:02:41.870 
ounces of gold of the tread supposedly

00:02:41.870 --> 00:02:44.470 
ounces of gold of the tread supposedly
held<00:02:42.170> at<00:02:42.319> the<00:02:42.410> treachery<00:02:42.860> right<00:02:43.520> which<00:02:44.300> we

00:02:44.470 --> 00:02:44.480 
held at the treachery right which we

00:02:44.480 --> 00:02:48.520 
held at the treachery right which we
sell<00:02:44.690> another<00:02:45.019> issue<00:02:45.230> there<00:02:45.709> but<00:02:47.290> and<00:02:48.290> I<00:02:48.350> came

00:02:55.390 --> 00:02:55.400 
something to make it reasonably possible

00:02:55.400 --> 00:02:57.520 
something to make it reasonably possible

to go back on a gold standard at some
press<00:02:57.739> minimum<00:02:58.190> if<00:02:58.340> they<00:02:58.519> covered<00:02:58.850> all<00:02:59.150> your

to all dollars you're probably talking

00:03:01.940 --> 00:03:03.640

00:03:03.640 --> 00:03:03.650 
around two hundred thousand dollars an

00:03:03.650 --> 00:03:06.040 
around two hundred thousand dollars an
ounce<00:03:03.830> mmm<00:03:04.580> you<00:03:04.730> know<00:03:04.850> that<00:03:05.300> was<00:03:05.450> just<00:03:05.720> for<00:03:05.900> hun

00:03:06.040 --> 00:03:06.050

central<00:03:06.440> bank<00:03:06.620> comfort's<00:03:07.040> yeah<00:03:07.550> exactly

central bank comfort's yeah exactly

00:03:08.030 --> 00:03:11.890 
central bank comfort's yeah exactly
though<00:03:08.569> yeah<00:03:08.989> I<00:03:10.300> think<00:03:11.300> if<00:03:11.390> they<00:03:11.540> offered<00:03:11.840> it

00:03:11.890 --> 00:03:11.900 
though yeah I think if they offered it

00:03:11.900 --> 00:03:13.150 
though yeah I think if they offered it
at<00:03:12.050> fifteen<00:03:12.410> hundred<00:03:12.709> dollars<00:03:12.950> an<00:03:13.069> ounce

00:03:13.150 --> 00:03:13.160 
at fifteen hundred dollars an ounce

00:03:13.160 --> 00:03:14.650 
at fifteen hundred dollars an ounce
right<00:03:13.430> now<00:03:13.610> yeah<00:03:13.850> they'd<00:03:14.090> be<00:03:14.120> able<00:03:14.420> to<00:03:14.480> buy

00:03:14.650 --> 00:03:14.660 
right now yeah they'd be able to buy

00:03:14.660 --> 00:03:16.810 
right now yeah they'd be able to buy
some<00:03:15.200> but<00:03:15.620> I<00:03:15.650> think<00:03:15.920> the<00:03:16.010> free<00:03:16.190> markets<00:03:16.640> would

00:03:16.810 --> 00:03:16.820 
some but I think the free markets would

00:03:16.820 --> 00:03:20.740 
some but I think the free markets would
right<00:03:17.480> away<00:03:18.070> figure<00:03:19.070> out<00:03:19.280> that<00:03:19.750> something's

00:03:20.740 --> 00:03:20.750 
right away figure out that something's

00:03:20.750 --> 00:03:22.960 
right away figure out that something's
up<00:03:20.959> there's<00:03:21.350> that<00:03:21.950> there's<00:03:22.370> something<00:03:22.640> I<00:03:22.820> put

00:03:22.960 --> 00:03:22.970 
up there's that there's something I put

00:03:22.970 --> 00:03:24.130 
up there's that there's something I put
the<00:03:23.120> dollar<00:03:23.299> that<00:03:23.510> there's<00:03:23.720> something<00:03:23.930> up

00:03:24.130 --> 00:03:24.140 
the dollar that there's something up

00:03:24.140 --> 00:03:25.900 
the dollar that there's something up
with<00:03:24.290> gold<00:03:24.590> and<00:03:25.070> they<00:03:25.430> would<00:03:25.579> that<00:03:25.790> would

00:03:25.900 --> 00:03:25.910 
with gold and they would that would

00:03:25.910 --> 00:03:28.750 
with gold and they would that would
cause<00:03:26.420> if<00:03:27.230> they<00:03:27.799> were<00:03:27.860> offering<00:03:28.130> more<00:03:28.549> than<00:03:28.700> a

00:03:28.750 --> 00:03:28.760 
cause if they were offering more than a

00:03:28.760 --> 00:03:30.370 
cause if they were offering more than a
free<00:03:28.970> market<00:03:29.120> price<00:03:29.450> right<00:03:29.750> now<00:03:29.780> if<00:03:30.079> the<00:03:30.170> gold

00:03:30.370 --> 00:03:30.380 
free market price right now if the gold

00:03:30.380 --> 00:03:32.650 
free market price right now if the gold
and<00:03:30.590> think<00:03:30.769> that<00:03:31.760> would<00:03:31.940> cause<00:03:32.150> a<00:03:32.180> rush<00:03:32.630> into

00:03:32.650 --> 00:03:32.660 
and think that would cause a rush into

00:03:32.660 --> 00:03:35.710 
and think that would cause a rush into
gold<00:03:33.170> I<00:03:34.150> think<00:03:35.150> they're<00:03:35.269> trapped<00:03:35.510> in<00:03:35.660> the

00:03:35.710 --> 00:03:35.720 
gold I think they're trapped in the

00:03:35.720 --> 00:03:40.150 
gold I think they're trapped in the
corner<00:03:35.870> I<00:03:36.049> don't<00:03:36.290> think<00:03:36.470> that<00:03:36.530> they<00:03:36.739> can<00:03:39.160> do

00:03:40.150 --> 00:03:40.160 
corner I don't think that they can do

00:03:40.160 --> 00:03:42.460 
corner I don't think that they can do
anything<00:03:40.640> that<00:03:40.850> will<00:03:41.000> be<00:03:41.510> positive<00:03:42.170> for<00:03:42.320> the
