to<00:01:57.479> lower<00:01:57.689> the<00:01:57.869> cholesterol<00:01:58.079> levels<00:01:58.860> so<00:01:59.700> this

00:02:00.679 --> 00:02:00.689 
to lower the cholesterol levels so this

00:02:00.689 --> 00:02:03.030 
to lower the cholesterol levels so this
should<00:02:01.500> be<00:02:01.619> really<00:02:01.979> considered

00:02:03.030 --> 00:02:03.040 
should be really considered

00:02:03.040 --> 00:02:05.730 
should be really considered
and<00:02:03.490> I<00:02:03.850> do<00:02:03.970> hope<00:02:04.930> that<00:02:04.990> you<00:02:05.230> would<00:02:05.500> see<00:02:05.710> a

00:02:10.499 --> 00:02:10.509 
like that so what is the drop free

00:02:10.509 --> 00:02:12.840 
like that so what is the drop free
relief<00:02:11.080> from<00:02:11.350> the<00:02:11.530> muscle<00:02:11.890> pain<00:02:12.160> and<00:02:12.400> the

00:02:12.840 --> 00:02:12.850 
relief from the muscle pain and the

00:02:12.850 --> 00:02:15.720 
relief from the muscle pain and the
answer<00:02:13.300> is<00:02:13.390> very<00:02:13.600> easy<00:02:13.840> it<00:02:14.200> is<00:02:14.590> a<00:02:14.620> plunge<00:02:15.370> and

00:02:15.720 --> 00:02:15.730 
answer is very easy it is a plunge and

00:02:15.730 --> 00:02:17.010 
answer is very easy it is a plunge and
what<00:02:15.970> a<00:02:16.000> full<00:02:16.270> plunge

00:02:17.010 --> 00:02:17.020 
what a full plunge

00:02:17.020 --> 00:02:19.890 
what a full plunge
it's<00:02:17.140> called<00:02:17.830> arnica<00:02:18.640> it<00:02:19.120> belongs<00:02:19.540> to<00:02:19.690> a

00:02:19.890 --> 00:02:19.900 
it's called arnica it belongs to a

00:02:19.900 --> 00:02:22.500 
it's called arnica it belongs to a
sunflower<00:02:20.470> family<00:02:21.130> and<00:02:21.340> it's<00:02:21.580> like<00:02:21.790> the<00:02:22.240> crows

00:02:22.500 --> 00:02:22.510 
sunflower family and it's like the crows

00:02:22.510 --> 00:02:26.460 
sunflower family and it's like the crows
in<00:02:22.870> the<00:02:23.080> regions<00:02:23.470> of<00:02:24.000> North<00:02:25.000> America<00:02:25.540> Central

flowering plant it it has almost emitted
in<00:02:58.180> fact<00:02:58.750> to<00:02:59.020> relieve<00:02:59.410> the<00:03:00.989> localized<00:03:01.989> pain

00:03:02.520 --> 00:03:02.530 
in fact to relieve the localized pain

in fact to relieve the localized pain
and<00:03:02.950> also<00:03:03.850> the<00:03:04.300> swelling<00:03:04.780> it<00:03:05.020> is<00:03:05.350> it<00:03:05.590> could<00:03:05.739> be

00:03:05.760 --> 00:03:05.770 
and also the swelling it is it could be

00:03:05.770 --> 00:03:07.590 
and also the swelling it is it could be
used<00:03:06.010> both<00:03:06.190> internally<00:03:07.060> let's<00:03:07.330> say<00:03:07.480> in<00:03:07.540> the

00:03:07.590 --> 00:03:07.600 
used both internally let's say in the

00:03:07.600 --> 00:03:11.220 
used both internally let's say in the
form<00:03:07.840> of<00:03:07.900> a<00:03:08.019> taster<00:03:08.530> or<00:03:10.110> externally<00:03:11.110> in<00:03:11.170> the

00:03:13.830 --> 00:03:13.840 
form of a cream or a gel you know and

00:03:13.840 --> 00:03:16.680 
form of a cream or a gel you know and
topically<00:03:14.560> imprints<00:03:15.280> of<00:03:15.340> the<00:03:15.459> gels<00:03:15.700> and<00:03:15.970> both

00:03:16.680 --> 00:03:16.690 
topically imprints of the gels and both

00:03:16.690 --> 00:03:19.770 
topically imprints of the gels and both
of<00:03:17.019> it<00:03:17.200> if<00:03:17.410> you<00:03:17.620> use<00:03:17.860> it<00:03:18.070> simultaneously<00:03:18.780> the

00:03:19.770 --> 00:03:19.780 
of it if you use it simultaneously the

00:03:19.780 --> 00:03:21.539 
of it if you use it simultaneously the
best<00:03:20.019> results<00:03:20.650> you<00:03:20.830> will<00:03:20.950> achieve<00:03:21.070> the<00:03:21.370> best

00:03:21.539 --> 00:03:21.549 
best results you will achieve the best

00:03:21.549 --> 00:03:24.870 
best results you will achieve the best
results<00:03:22.180> so<00:03:22.620> how<00:03:23.620> does<00:03:23.680> the<00:03:24.130> arnica<00:03:24.700> work

00:03:24.870 --> 00:03:24.880 
results so how does the arnica work

00:03:24.880 --> 00:03:26.640 
results so how does the arnica work
let's<00:03:25.150> say<00:03:25.269> you<00:03:25.360> got<00:03:25.510> a<00:03:25.570> gel<00:03:25.959> and<00:03:25.989> then<00:03:26.290> you<00:03:26.440> if

00:03:26.640 --> 00:03:26.650 
let's say you got a gel and then you if

00:03:26.650 --> 00:03:29.550 
let's say you got a gel and then you if
you<00:03:26.860> apply<00:03:27.250> it<00:03:27.280> promptly<00:03:27.910> it<00:03:28.570> helps<00:03:29.440> to

00:03:29.550 --> 00:03:29.560 
you apply it promptly it helps to

00:03:29.560 --> 00:03:31.140 
you apply it promptly it helps to
prevent<00:03:29.830> the<00:03:29.980> formation<00:03:30.190> of<00:03:30.519> the<00:03:30.640> bruises

00:03:31.140 --> 00:03:31.150 
prevent the formation of the bruises

00:03:31.150 --> 00:03:33.300 
prevent the formation of the bruises
actually<00:03:32.080> what<00:03:32.470> is<00:03:32.590> the<00:03:32.709> bruises<00:03:33.070> you<00:03:33.100> know

00:03:33.300 --> 00:03:33.310 
actually what is the bruises you know

00:03:33.310 --> 00:03:35.400 
actually what is the bruises you know
actually<00:03:33.760> stops<00:03:34.120> the<00:03:34.239> capillaries<00:03:34.930> from

00:03:35.400 --> 00:03:35.410 
actually stops the capillaries from

00:03:35.410 --> 00:03:38.220 
actually stops the capillaries from
bleeding<00:03:35.650> also<00:03:36.610> it<00:03:36.730> works<00:03:36.940> as<00:03:37.180> a<00:03:37.239> simulant

00:03:38.220 --> 00:03:38.230 
bleeding also it works as a simulant

00:03:38.230 --> 00:03:40.380 
bleeding also it works as a simulant
and<00:03:38.400> stimulating<00:03:39.400> the<00:03:39.430> activity<00:03:40.090> of<00:03:40.180> the

00:03:40.380 --> 00:03:40.390 
and stimulating the activity of the

00:03:40.390 --> 00:03:42.690 
and stimulating the activity of the
white<00:03:40.570> blood<00:03:40.840> cells<00:03:41.130> which<00:03:42.130> process

00:03:42.690 --> 00:03:42.700 
white blood cells which process

00:03:42.700 --> 00:03:45.030 
white blood cells which process
congested<00:03:43.269> blood<00:03:43.480> and<00:03:43.810> by<00:03:44.470> dispersing

00:03:45.030 --> 00:03:45.040 
congested blood and by dispersing

00:03:45.040 --> 00:03:47.520 
congested blood and by dispersing
trapped<00:03:45.670> foods<00:03:46.030> from<00:03:46.330> joints<00:03:46.810> and<00:03:46.930> muscles

00:03:47.520 --> 00:03:47.530 
trapped foods from joints and muscles

00:03:47.530 --> 00:03:50.460 
trapped foods from joints and muscles
and<00:03:47.620> bumped<00:03:48.370> and<00:03:48.489> bruised<00:03:49.030> tissue<00:03:49.600> so<00:03:50.260> that's

00:03:50.460 --> 00:03:50.470 
and bumped and bruised tissue so that's

00:03:50.470 --> 00:03:52.530 
and bumped and bruised tissue so that's
basically<00:03:50.860> the<00:03:50.980> way<00:03:51.130> it<00:03:51.310> works<00:03:51.370> it<00:03:51.970> also<00:03:52.150> has

00:03:52.530 --> 00:03:52.540 
basically the way it works it also has

00:03:52.540 --> 00:03:55.170 
basically the way it works it also has
great<00:03:52.870> anti<00:03:53.380> Flaman<00:03:54.180> antibacterial
