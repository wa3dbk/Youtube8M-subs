00:03:21.250 --> 00:03:21.260 

00:03:21.260 --> 00:03:46.990 

in<00:03:22.260> each<00:03:22.410> other

00:03:46.990 --> 00:03:47.000 

00:03:47.000 --> 00:03:49.360 

I<00:03:47.380> mean<00:03:48.380> it<00:03:48.470> was<00:03:48.560> a<00:03:48.590> fun<00:03:48.740> experience<00:03:48.860> obviously

00:03:49.360 --> 00:03:49.370 
I mean it was a fun experience obviously

00:03:49.370 --> 00:03:50.650 
I mean it was a fun experience obviously
while<00:03:49.760> sharing<00:03:49.970> the<00:03:50.060> words<00:03:50.210> in<00:03:50.270> the<00:03:50.330> shootout

00:03:50.650 --> 00:03:50.660 
while sharing the words in the shootout

00:03:50.660 --> 00:03:52.180 
while sharing the words in the shootout
we<00:03:51.080> didn't<00:03:51.230> play<00:03:51.350> a<00:03:51.380> grade<00:03:51.590> the<00:03:51.710> first<00:03:51.890> period

00:03:52.180 --> 00:03:52.190 
we didn't play a grade the first period

00:03:52.190 --> 00:03:54.790 
we didn't play a grade the first period
and<00:03:52.940> ultimately<00:03:53.930> then<00:03:54.110> it<00:03:54.170> cost<00:03:54.350> us<00:03:54.500> a<00:03:54.620> game

00:03:54.790 --> 00:03:54.800 
and ultimately then it cost us a game

00:03:54.800 --> 00:03:56.950 
and ultimately then it cost us a game
but<00:03:55.040> no<00:03:55.760> in<00:03:55.820> the<00:03:55.880> third<00:03:56.060> I<00:03:56.150> think<00:03:56.180> got<00:03:56.780> a<00:03:56.810> little

00:03:56.950 --> 00:03:56.960 
but no in the third I think got a little

00:03:56.960 --> 00:03:59.080 
but no in the third I think got a little
sloppy<00:03:57.140> to<00:03:57.410> drive<00:03:57.590> away<00:03:57.710> from<00:03:57.890> argument<00:03:58.370> you

00:03:59.080 --> 00:03:59.090 
sloppy to drive away from argument you

00:03:59.090 --> 00:04:00.130 
sloppy to drive away from argument you
know<00:03:59.210> what<00:03:59.300> frustrating<00:03:59.660> lose<00:03:59.810> a<00:03:59.840> game<00:03:59.990> like

00:04:00.130 --> 00:04:00.140 
know what frustrating lose a game like

00:04:00.140 --> 00:04:03.760 
know what frustrating lose a game like
that<00:04:00.200> but<00:04:00.470> the<00:04:00.530> experience<00:04:00.920> was<00:04:00.980> unbelievable
