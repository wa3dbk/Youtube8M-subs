so if you're a player that uses both

00:03:38.099 --> 00:03:40.369 
so if you're a player that uses both
pickups<00:03:38.400> a<00:03:38.670> lot<00:03:38.819> don't<00:03:39.540> do<00:03:39.689> this<00:03:39.840> if<00:03:40.019> it's<00:03:40.200> in

00:03:40.369 --> 00:03:40.379 
pickups a lot don't do this if it's in

00:03:40.379 --> 00:03:42.530 
pickups a lot don't do this if it's in
both<00:03:40.650> is<00:03:40.890> at<00:03:41.040> least<00:03:41.189> on<00:03:41.310> this<00:03:41.459> guitar<00:03:41.610> it

00:04:00.510 --> 00:04:03.440 

so<00:04:01.510> to<00:04:01.959> go<00:04:02.379> over<00:04:02.409> this<00:04:02.620> again

00:04:03.440 --> 00:04:03.450 
so to go over this again

00:04:03.450 --> 00:04:31.640 
so to go over this again
loosen<00:04:04.450> the<00:04:05.129> you<00:04:06.129> know<00:04:06.220> lift<00:04:06.459> the<00:04:06.579> floyd<00:04:06.849> up
