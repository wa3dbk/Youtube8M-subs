00:00:51.770 --> 00:00:51.780 
so what effect do you think your an

00:00:51.780 --> 00:00:56.090

active<00:00:52.200> participation<00:00:52.830> has<00:00:53.220> on<00:00:53.490> the<00:00:53.610> students

00:00:56.090 --> 00:00:56.100 

00:00:56.100 --> 00:00:58.160 

I<00:00:56.210> think<00:00:57.210> it's<00:00:57.300> a<00:00:57.329> great<00:00:57.510> example<00:00:57.629> especially

00:00:58.160 --> 00:00:58.170 
I think it's a great example especially

00:00:58.170 --> 00:01:01.369 
I think it's a great example especially
for<00:00:58.680> the<00:00:59.430> gentleman<00:00:59.879> that<00:01:00.269> this<00:01:00.750> is<00:01:00.930> something

00:01:01.369 --> 00:01:01.379 
for the gentleman that this is something

00:01:01.379 --> 00:01:05.299 
for the gentleman that this is something
that<00:01:01.910> adults<00:01:02.910> and<00:01:03.300> males<00:01:03.989> can<00:01:04.860> actively

00:01:05.299 --> 00:01:05.309 
that adults and males can actively

00:01:05.309 --> 00:01:08.630 
that adults and males can actively
involve<00:01:05.759> and<00:01:06.090> be<00:01:06.570> involved<00:01:06.869> in<00:01:07.140> I<00:01:07.520> think<00:01:08.520> it's

00:01:08.630 --> 00:01:08.640 
involve and be involved in I think it's

00:01:08.640 --> 00:01:10.370 
involve and be involved in I think it's
also<00:01:08.909> a<00:01:09.030> common<00:01:09.330> presence<00:01:09.750> for<00:01:09.869> the<00:01:09.899> students

00:01:10.370 --> 00:01:10.380 
also a common presence for the students

00:01:10.380 --> 00:01:13.219 
also a common presence for the students
and<00:01:10.470> it's<00:01:10.590> something<00:01:10.770> that<00:01:11.100> shows<00:01:11.460> that<00:01:11.880> I<00:01:12.659> can

00:01:13.219 --> 00:01:13.229 
and it's something that shows that I can

00:01:13.229 --> 00:01:19.010 
and it's something that shows that I can
more<00:01:13.979> than<00:01:14.460> just<00:01:14.850> a<00:01:15.530> disciplinarian<00:01:18.020> someone

00:01:19.010 --> 00:01:19.020 
more than just a disciplinarian someone

00:01:19.020 --> 00:01:20.960 
more than just a disciplinarian someone
who<00:01:19.200> can<00:01:19.409> understand<00:01:20.039> the<00:01:20.490> world<00:01:20.700> through
