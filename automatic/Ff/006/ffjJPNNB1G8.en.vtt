00:07:46.380 --> 00:07:50.960 
time in his career fight for a
championship<00:07:47.220> fight<00:07:48.740> for<00:07:49.740> championship<00:07:50.460> only

00:07:50.960 --> 00:07:50.970 
championship fight for championship only

00:07:50.970 --> 00:07:53.659 
championship fight for championship only
fight<00:07:51.270> for<00:07:51.479> a<00:07:51.510> championship<00:07:52.110> but<00:07:52.950> not<00:07:53.370> being

00:07:53.659 --> 00:07:53.669 
fight for a championship but not being

00:07:53.669 --> 00:07:56.629 
fight for a championship but not being
on<00:07:54.419> this<00:07:54.750> level<00:07:55.020> yet<00:07:55.350> I<00:07:55.650> think<00:07:56.310> it's<00:07:56.460> one<00:07:56.610> of

00:07:56.629 --> 00:07:56.639 
on this level yet I think it's one of

00:07:56.639 --> 00:07:58.250 
on this level yet I think it's one of
those<00:07:56.729> things<00:07:56.789> where<00:07:57.000> he's<00:07:57.240> on<00:07:57.389> the<00:07:57.570> stage<00:07:57.840> too

00:07:58.250 --> 00:07:58.260 
those things where he's on the stage too

00:07:58.260 --> 00:08:00.620 
those things where he's on the stage too
early<00:07:58.620> and<00:07:59.430> I<00:07:59.460> think<00:07:59.669> black<00:08:00.060> mare<00:08:00.330> should

00:08:00.620 --> 00:08:00.630 
early and I think black mare should

00:08:00.630 --> 00:08:03.080 
early and I think black mare should
knock<00:08:00.840> them<00:08:01.020> out<00:08:01.110> in<00:08:01.440> nine<00:08:01.860> rounds<00:08:02.130> so<00:08:02.820> anyway

00:08:03.080 --> 00:08:03.090 
knock them out in nine rounds so anyway

00:08:03.090 --> 00:08:05.900 
knock them out in nine rounds so anyway
