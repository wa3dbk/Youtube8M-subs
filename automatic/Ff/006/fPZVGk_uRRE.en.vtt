00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.610
 I'm here in Germany the attempts 

00:00:01.650 --> 00:00:03.870
 better with the grammar now 

00:00:02.610 --> 00:00:06.440
 to watch because in Austria is but 

00:00:03.870 --> 00:00:06.440
 more and more like that 

00:00:15.420 --> 00:00:19.750
 the burner as on the 

00:00:17.740 --> 00:00:22.390
 Pension insurance at the beginning and 

00:00:19.750 --> 00:00:24.539
 learns that up to 84 has to work around 

00:00:22.390 --> 00:00:26.920
 to get a pension at all 

00:00:24.539 --> 00:00:30.730
 because that reminds me he still has 

00:00:26.920 --> 00:00:32.500
 this old demolition house and graz that he 

00:00:30.730 --> 00:00:34.260
 inherited from his grandfather and 

00:00:32.500 --> 00:00:37.000
 goes to grad 

00:00:34.260 --> 00:00:39.870
 the city of his youth where everything 

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:42.149
 The city started from where 

00:00:39.870 --> 00:00:45.010
 broke into the world around 

00:00:42.149 --> 00:00:46.600
 actually completely unsuccessful 

00:00:45.010 --> 00:00:48.489
 and now he comes back meeting 

00:00:46.600 --> 00:00:50.350
 School friends the whole thing is developing 

00:00:48.489 --> 00:00:52.090
 but for the agonizing class reunion 

00:00:50.350 --> 00:00:53.420
 does not last one afternoon but 

00:00:52.090 --> 00:00:57.050
 a 

00:00:53.420 --> 00:01:00.260
 a few days and suddenly makes up for it 

00:00:57.050 --> 00:01:01.909
 in the hospital with a hole in his head 

00:01:00.260 --> 00:01:04.070
 has his head shot the ball 

00:01:01.909 --> 00:01:09.710
 out of surgery and he sets off on the 

00:01:04.070 --> 00:01:12.039
 look for the one in the enz kill 

00:01:09.710 --> 00:01:14.210
 had tried the correct formulation 

00:01:12.039 --> 00:01:15.170
 i'm trying in germany 

00:01:14.210 --> 00:01:16.430
 better with the grammar now 

00:01:15.170 --> 00:01:20.149
 to watch because in Austria is but 

00:01:16.430 --> 00:01:21.789
 more and more her job 

00:01:20.149 --> 00:01:24.380
 bad phase 

00:01:21.789 --> 00:01:25.610
 Mr. Brenner is homeless is one 

00:01:24.380 --> 00:01:27.830
 crown insured of the trade 

00:01:25.610 --> 00:01:28.640
 social insurance simca bank account you 

00:01:27.830 --> 00:01:30.500
 be on board 

00:01:28.640 --> 00:01:31.670
 that would be something bad professional 

00:01:30.500 --> 00:01:34.490
 termed phase 

00:01:31.670 --> 00:01:35.179
 this is not a typical grazer musician 

00:01:34.490 --> 00:01:43.520
 to care 

00:01:35.179 --> 00:01:46.940
 he is neither alcoholic but so 

00:01:43.520 --> 00:01:48.799
 when we come to Graz from the north 

00:01:46.940 --> 00:01:50.509
 South of the Alps then so is abt 

00:01:48.799 --> 00:01:51.259
 as if it were already before the station of 

00:01:50.509 --> 00:01:53.299
 Italy 

00:01:51.259 --> 00:01:55.909
 People like to drink wine 

00:01:53.299 --> 00:01:58.219
 on places around its cheerful 

00:01:55.909 --> 00:01:59.600
 incomprehensible language you speak 

00:01:58.219 --> 00:02:01.340
 So it does not understand it's a picture 

00:01:59.600 --> 00:02:01.850
 already the first foreign country on the way in 

00:02:01.340 --> 00:02:03.740
 the South 

00:02:01.850 --> 00:02:05.869
 This kind of graz we do not need 

00:02:03.740 --> 00:02:07.789
 we can have so far dreary 

00:02:05.869 --> 00:02:09.679
 Graz brought in the first half of the film 

00:02:07.789 --> 00:02:11.000
 stupidly always nice weather but 

00:02:09.679 --> 00:02:14.299
 my computer have the nice weather 

00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:15.799
 gets away and in the second half becomes 

00:02:14.299 --> 00:02:19.420
 the weather is better then we have 

00:02:15.799 --> 00:02:19.420
 can use without computer 

00:02:25.480 --> 00:02:33.750
 it was the wind that got the burner closed 

00:02:29.799 --> 00:02:33.750
 become a loner 

00:02:34.200 --> 00:02:43.180
 I think that's one 

00:02:40.049 --> 00:02:45.700
 I can do it very professionally 

00:02:43.180 --> 00:02:48.000
 talk about it because I'm really with 

00:02:45.700 --> 00:02:50.290
 same age to puberty 

00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:52.360
 did not want to do anything at all and 

00:02:50.290 --> 00:02:54.549
 since then you still really something 

00:02:52.360 --> 00:02:56.200
 decisive happens do it with me 

00:02:54.549 --> 00:02:59.980
 Alone from so a bit again 

00:02:56.200 --> 00:03:01.750
 burner and and that happens so you 

00:02:59.980 --> 00:03:03.549
 a childhood has the predominantly of 

00:03:01.750 --> 00:03:06.129
 grandparents is shaped or at least 

00:03:03.549 --> 00:03:07.930
 not of the same age kindergarten 

00:03:06.129 --> 00:03:09.370
 does not exist yet then one comes 

00:03:07.930 --> 00:03:10.930
 in the school can be found at all 

00:03:09.370 --> 00:03:13.060
 not so soon 

00:03:10.930 --> 00:03:16.840
 bullied one says to day earlier one has 

00:03:13.060 --> 00:03:18.849
 said killed and then it will always be 

00:03:16.840 --> 00:03:23.160
 harder to integrate socially 

00:03:18.849 --> 00:03:25.690
 is that someday succeeded because 

00:03:23.160 --> 00:03:27.040
 you played the school theater and 

00:03:25.690 --> 00:03:28.030
 somehow I have some recognition 

00:03:27.040 --> 00:03:30.370
 then get it 

00:03:28.030 --> 00:03:31.750
 in the group but the burner is the 

00:03:30.370 --> 00:03:33.700
 it did not succeed and since then or 

00:03:31.750 --> 00:03:36.639
 ever a problem with too many 

00:03:33.700 --> 00:03:40.329
 People in women only try it often 

00:03:36.639 --> 00:03:42.569
 what works less and less with 

00:03:40.329 --> 00:03:46.060
 Men can not do well 

00:03:42.569 --> 00:03:48.720
 In addition , the friend but defended with the 

00:03:46.060 --> 00:03:51.340
 Unfortunately it will not be in the film 

00:03:48.720 --> 00:03:54.900
 the lost in the leyen go to graz 

00:03:51.340 --> 00:03:54.900
 that is why it is really alone in graz 

00:04:02.810 --> 00:04:07.470
 what i did is that i am in 

00:04:05.520 --> 00:04:10.080
 written in younger years 

00:04:07.470 --> 00:04:11.430
 I've never finished and 

00:04:10.080 --> 00:04:13.880
 I have them as quarries 

00:04:11.430 --> 00:04:16.440
 used for later projects 

00:04:13.880 --> 00:04:17.970
 There are some ideas of old ones 

00:04:16.440 --> 00:04:19.410
 Scripts design in bringing burners 

00:04:17.970 --> 00:04:22.230
 others are in the film 

00:04:19.410 --> 00:04:25.139
 Cabaret programs a big one 

00:04:22.230 --> 00:04:27.330
 great long script that me 

00:04:25.139 --> 00:04:29.490
 I have written ten then 

00:04:27.330 --> 00:04:31.260
 years later to this one 

00:04:29.490 --> 00:04:32.970
 pathologist to a pathologist 

00:04:31.260 --> 00:04:36.570
 two-piece work for television 

00:04:32.970 --> 00:04:37.919
 So earlier I have fewer scripts 

00:04:36.570 --> 00:04:40.500
 That's it 

00:04:37.919 --> 00:04:42.419
 somehow come with age because 

00:04:40.500 --> 00:04:44.370
 I do not live the way I live better 

00:04:42.419 --> 00:04:46.700
 can concentrate through less alcohol 

00:04:44.370 --> 00:04:46.700
 or so
