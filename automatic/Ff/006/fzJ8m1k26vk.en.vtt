got Walker's video diary and doing a

00:00:05.549 --> 00:00:06.950 
got Walker's video diary and doing a
little<00:00:05.670> bit<00:00:05.819> of<00:00:06.029> work<00:00:06.270> at<00:00:06.450> the<00:00:06.540> front<00:00:06.779> door

00:00:06.950 --> 00:00:06.960

again today we wanted to talk a little
bit<00:00:10.200> about<00:00:10.290> the<00:00:10.530> front<00:00:10.800> door<00:00:11.010> seeing<00:00:11.490> is<00:00:11.610> that

00:00:11.660 --> 00:00:11.670 
bit about the front door seeing is that

00:00:11.670 --> 00:00:13.310 
bit about the front door seeing is that
I<00:00:11.820> see<00:00:12.120> so<00:00:12.360> many<00:00:12.480> people<00:00:12.599> especially<00:00:12.929> my

trouble they have is basically they have

00:00:20.609 --> 00:00:22.970 
trouble they have is basically they have
high<00:00:20.820> energy<00:00:21.000> jobs<00:00:21.420> just<00:00:21.869> like<00:00:22.020> blue<00:00:22.380> lose<00:00:22.800> of

00:00:22.970 --> 00:00:22.980 
high energy jobs just like blue lose of

00:00:22.980 --> 00:00:25.609 
high energy jobs just like blue lose of
each<00:00:23.130> lung<00:00:23.430> and<00:00:23.789> they<00:00:24.750> are<00:00:24.810> super<00:00:25.140> high-energy

00:00:25.609 --> 00:00:25.619 
each lung and they are super high-energy

00:00:25.619 --> 00:00:27.890 
each lung and they are super high-energy
dogs<00:00:26.010> even<00:00:26.820> though<00:00:26.970> he's<00:00:27.240> well<00:00:27.480> behaved

00:00:27.890 --> 00:00:27.900 
dogs even though he's well behaved

00:00:27.900 --> 00:00:31.429 
dogs even though he's well behaved
weight<00:00:28.789> even<00:00:29.789> though<00:00:29.849> he's<00:00:30.119> well<00:00:30.330> behaved<00:00:30.720> he

00:00:31.429 --> 00:00:31.439 
weight even though he's well behaved he

00:00:31.439 --> 00:00:33.380 
weight even though he's well behaved he
is<00:00:31.529> a<00:00:31.560> high<00:00:31.890> energy<00:00:32.099> dog<00:00:32.520> just<00:00:32.910> like<00:00:33.000> all<00:00:33.270> the

00:00:33.380 --> 00:00:33.390 
is a high energy dog just like all the

00:00:33.390 --> 00:00:34.670 
is a high energy dog just like all the
other<00:00:33.540> dogs<00:00:33.809> in<00:00:33.930> the<00:00:34.050> neighborhood<00:00:34.410> and<00:00:34.530> the

00:00:34.670 --> 00:00:34.680 
other dogs in the neighborhood and the

00:00:34.680 --> 00:00:36.530 
other dogs in the neighborhood and the
problem<00:00:35.040> they<00:00:35.160> have<00:00:35.309> is<00:00:35.340> when<00:00:35.579> the<00:00:35.700> doors<00:00:35.940> open

00:00:36.530 --> 00:00:36.540 
problem they have is when the doors open

00:00:36.540 --> 00:00:39.380 
problem they have is when the doors open
it's<00:00:36.690> kind<00:00:37.469> of<00:00:37.559> like<00:00:37.800> an<00:00:38.010> an<00:00:38.250> invitation<00:00:39.210> for

00:00:39.380 --> 00:00:39.390 
it's kind of like an an invitation for

00:00:39.390 --> 00:00:41.090 
it's kind of like an an invitation for
the<00:00:39.510> dog<00:00:39.660> to<00:00:39.899> take<00:00:40.079> off<00:00:40.320> and<00:00:40.530> run<00:00:40.680> out<00:00:40.860> and

00:00:41.090 --> 00:00:41.100 
the dog to take off and run out and

00:00:41.100 --> 00:00:43.400 
the dog to take off and run out and
since<00:00:41.579> they're<00:00:41.760> such<00:00:42.090> high<00:00:42.270> energy<00:00:42.690> dogs<00:00:42.930> once

00:00:43.400 --> 00:00:43.410 
since they're such high energy dogs once

00:00:43.410 --> 00:00:45.350 
since they're such high energy dogs once
they<00:00:43.620> passed<00:00:43.950> that<00:00:44.250> that<00:00:44.730> level<00:00:45.149> you<00:00:45.239> know

00:00:45.350 --> 00:00:45.360 
they passed that that level you know

00:00:45.360 --> 00:00:47.420 
they passed that that level you know
like<00:00:45.510> a<00:00:45.539> dog<00:00:45.780> goes<00:00:46.020> from<00:00:46.260> zero<00:00:46.649> to<00:00:46.770> two<00:00:47.309> a

00:00:47.420 --> 00:00:47.430 
like a dog goes from zero to two a

00:00:47.430 --> 00:00:48.860 
like a dog goes from zero to two a
hundred<00:00:47.610> and<00:00:47.940> sixty<00:00:48.329> Seconds

00:00:48.860 --> 00:00:48.870 
hundred and sixty Seconds

00:00:48.870 --> 00:00:50.810 
hundred and sixty Seconds
but<00:00:49.230> once<00:00:49.440> they<00:00:49.620> pass<00:00:49.890> a<00:00:49.920> certain<00:00:50.309> level<00:00:50.489> to

00:00:50.810 --> 00:00:50.820 
but once they pass a certain level to

00:00:50.820 --> 00:00:52.130 
but once they pass a certain level to
get<00:00:51.149> them<00:00:51.300> to<00:00:51.480> stop

00:00:52.130 --> 00:00:52.140 
get them to stop

00:00:52.140 --> 00:00:53.569 
get them to stop
once<00:00:52.320> they're<00:00:52.559> out<00:00:52.710> the<00:00:53.039> front<00:00:53.309> door<00:00:53.489> is

00:00:53.569 --> 00:00:53.579 
once they're out the front door is

00:00:53.579 --> 00:00:55.549 
once they're out the front door is
impossible<00:00:54.180> so<00:00:54.360> then<00:00:54.809> the<00:00:55.110> neighbors<00:00:55.440> are

00:00:55.549 --> 00:00:55.559 
impossible so then the neighbors are

00:00:55.559 --> 00:00:56.750 
impossible so then the neighbors are
chasing<00:00:55.920> their<00:00:56.039> dogs<00:00:56.219> all<00:00:56.430> around<00:00:56.699> the

00:00:56.750 --> 00:00:56.760 
chasing their dogs all around the

00:00:56.760 --> 00:00:57.680 
chasing their dogs all around the
neighborhood<00:00:56.879> all<00:00:57.210> the<00:00:57.239> time

00:00:57.680 --> 00:00:57.690 
neighborhood all the time

00:00:57.690 --> 00:01:01.189 
neighborhood all the time
wait<00:00:57.870> so<00:00:58.879> by<00:00:59.879> teaching<00:00:59.940> the<00:01:00.510> dog<00:01:00.660> impulse

00:01:01.189 --> 00:01:01.199 
wait so by teaching the dog impulse

00:01:01.199 --> 00:01:02.599 
wait so by teaching the dog impulse
control<00:01:01.379> and<00:01:01.590> basically<00:01:02.039> teaching<00:01:02.370> him<00:01:02.460> that

00:01:02.599 --> 00:01:02.609 
control and basically teaching him that

00:01:02.609 --> 00:01:04.039 
control and basically teaching him that
there's<00:01:02.760> an<00:01:02.910> invisible<00:01:03.390> boundary<00:01:03.750> right<00:01:03.989> here

00:01:04.039 --> 00:01:04.049 
there's an invisible boundary right here

00:01:04.049 --> 00:01:06.230 
there's an invisible boundary right here
that<00:01:04.470> he<00:01:04.619> can't<00:01:04.860> cross<00:01:05.100> until<00:01:05.430> he's<00:01:05.729> invited

00:01:06.230 --> 00:01:06.240 
that he can't cross until he's invited

00:01:06.240 --> 00:01:11.240 
that he can't cross until he's invited
it<00:01:06.689> helps<00:01:06.990> with<00:01:07.140> that<00:01:07.350> problem<00:01:07.740> so<00:01:10.130> what<00:01:11.130> you

00:01:11.240 --> 00:01:11.250 
it helps with that problem so what you

00:01:11.250 --> 00:01:12.710 
it helps with that problem so what you
notice<00:01:11.460> is<00:01:11.670> that<00:01:11.820> I'll<00:01:11.939> walk<00:01:12.090> out<00:01:12.299> given<00:01:12.659> the

00:01:12.710 --> 00:01:12.720 
notice is that I'll walk out given the

00:01:12.720 --> 00:01:14.149 
notice is that I'll walk out given the
mental<00:01:13.140> weights<00:01:13.350> because<00:01:13.560> I<00:01:13.740> don't<00:01:13.890> want<00:01:14.010> to

00:01:14.149 --> 00:01:14.159 
mental weights because I don't want to

00:01:14.159 --> 00:01:15.710 
mental weights because I don't want to
fail<00:01:14.369> and<00:01:14.580> I<00:01:14.640> wanted<00:01:14.850> to<00:01:14.909> understand<00:01:15.330> I<00:01:15.360> wanted

00:01:15.710 --> 00:01:15.720 
fail and I wanted to understand I wanted

00:01:15.720 --> 00:01:17.960 
fail and I wanted to understand I wanted
to<00:01:15.810> wait<00:01:15.990> until<00:01:16.020> you<00:01:16.439> fight<00:01:16.740> them<00:01:16.920> up<00:01:17.070> so<00:01:17.610> that

00:01:17.960 --> 00:01:17.970 
to wait until you fight them up so that

00:01:17.970 --> 00:01:20.719 
to wait until you fight them up so that
helps<00:01:18.299> him<00:01:18.420> understand<00:01:18.869> and<00:01:19.170> also<00:01:19.590> sets<00:01:20.460> him

00:01:20.719 --> 00:01:20.729 
helps him understand and also sets him

00:01:20.729 --> 00:01:22.399 
helps him understand and also sets him
up<00:01:20.850> for<00:01:20.909> success<00:01:21.450> so<00:01:21.750> here<00:01:21.990> we<00:01:22.049> go

00:01:22.399 --> 00:01:22.409 
up for success so here we go

00:01:22.409 --> 00:01:25.429 
up for success so here we go
wait<00:01:22.970> so<00:01:23.970> I<00:01:24.210> walked<00:01:24.509> out<00:01:24.659> the<00:01:24.780> front<00:01:24.810> door<00:01:25.259> I

00:01:25.429 --> 00:01:25.439 
wait so I walked out the front door I

00:01:25.439 --> 00:01:34.280 
wait so I walked out the front door I
don't<00:01:25.830> even<00:01:25.890> look<00:01:26.100> at<00:01:26.280> him<00:01:32.869> in<00:01:33.869> other<00:01:33.990> words<00:01:34.229> I

00:01:34.280 --> 00:01:34.290 
don't even look at him in other words I

00:01:34.290 --> 00:01:36.230 
don't even look at him in other words I
don't<00:01:34.439> have<00:01:34.740> a<00:01:34.770> chain<00:01:35.040> on<00:01:35.340> him<00:01:35.610> and<00:01:36.060> I<00:01:36.210> don't

00:01:36.230 --> 00:01:36.240 
don't have a chain on him and I don't

00:01:36.240 --> 00:01:38.120 
don't have a chain on him and I don't
have<00:01:36.540> a<00:01:36.570> baby<00:01:36.840> gate<00:01:37.110> at<00:01:37.259> the<00:01:37.290> front<00:01:37.470> door<00:01:37.770> I'm

00:01:38.120 --> 00:01:38.130 
have a baby gate at the front door I'm

00:01:38.130 --> 00:01:40.870 
have a baby gate at the front door I'm
doing<00:01:38.520> this<00:01:38.700> with<00:01:38.970> my<00:01:39.000> mind<00:01:39.540> and<00:01:39.840> basically

00:01:40.870 --> 00:01:40.880 
doing this with my mind and basically

00:01:40.880 --> 00:01:43.399 
doing this with my mind and basically
telling<00:01:41.880> him<00:01:42.240> that<00:01:42.509> even<00:01:42.869> though<00:01:43.020> the<00:01:43.170> doors
