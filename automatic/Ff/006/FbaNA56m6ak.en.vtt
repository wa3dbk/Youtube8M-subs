very<00:01:22.369> early<00:01:22.640> life<00:01:22.820> as<00:01:22.939> well<00:01:23.060> sort<00:01:23.420> of<00:01:23.479> him

00:01:23.649 --> 00:01:23.659 
very early life as well sort of him

00:01:23.659 --> 00:01:26.410 
very early life as well sort of him
after<00:01:23.929> the<00:01:24.320> last<00:01:24.560> one<00:01:24.770> in<00:01:24.890> school<00:01:25.130> and<00:01:25.549> I<00:01:26.299> was

00:01:26.410 --> 00:01:26.420 
after the last one in school and I was

00:01:26.420 --> 00:01:30.599 
after the last one in school and I was
sort<00:01:26.630> of<00:01:26.659> thinking<00:01:26.869> about<00:01:27.200> a<00:01:27.530> character<00:01:27.950> like

00:01:30.599 --> 00:01:30.609 

00:01:30.609 --> 00:01:33.399 

you<00:01:31.609> know<00:01:31.729> I<00:01:31.999> thought<00:01:32.420> this<00:01:32.659> character<00:01:33.259> that

00:01:33.399 --> 00:01:33.409 
you know I thought this character that

00:01:33.409 --> 00:01:36.010 
you know I thought this character that
goes<00:01:33.649> into<00:01:33.859> toilet<00:01:34.189> fill<00:01:34.549> and<00:01:34.820> pops<00:01:35.539> out<00:01:35.749> also

00:01:36.010 --> 00:01:36.020 
goes into toilet fill and pops out also

00:01:36.020 --> 00:01:39.340 
goes into toilet fill and pops out also
in<00:01:36.649> a<00:01:36.770> sexual<00:01:37.520> manner

00:01:39.340 --> 00:01:39.350 
in a sexual manner

00:01:39.350 --> 00:01:42.310 
in a sexual manner
but<00:01:40.010> I<00:01:40.189> sort<00:01:40.729> of<00:01:40.790> lived<00:01:41.060> now<00:01:41.420> I've<00:01:41.780> moved<00:01:42.080> more

00:01:42.310 --> 00:01:42.320

00:01:42.320 --> 00:01:44.469 
but I sort of lived now I've moved more
towards<00:01:42.380> I<00:01:43.070> realized<00:01:43.640> that<00:01:43.759> I<00:01:43.909> didn't<00:01:44.330> need<00:01:44.420> a

00:01:44.469 --> 00:01:44.479 
towards I realized that I didn't need a

00:01:44.479 --> 00:01:46.810 
towards I realized that I didn't need a
character<00:01:44.780> and<00:01:45.200> i<00:01:45.470> am<00:01:45.590> the<00:01:45.619> character<00:01:46.159> and

00:01:46.810 --> 00:01:46.820
