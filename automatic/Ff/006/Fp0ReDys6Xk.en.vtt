with<00:01:53.040> both<00:01:53.250> you<00:01:53.610> get<00:01:53.820> the<00:01:54.240> drugs<00:01:54.450> but<00:01:54.810> only<00:01:55.020> the

00:01:55.100 --> 00:01:55.110 
with both you get the drugs but only the

00:01:55.110 --> 00:01:58.520 
with both you get the drugs but only the
top<00:01:55.170> do<00:01:55.439> you<00:01:55.500> get<00:01:55.619> the<00:01:55.740> seeds<00:01:55.979> um<00:01:57.200> so<00:01:58.200> now<00:01:58.350> let's

00:01:58.520 --> 00:01:58.530 
top do you get the seeds um so now let's

00:01:58.530 --> 00:02:01.249 
top do you get the seeds um so now let's
go<00:01:58.680> over<00:01:58.890> to<00:01:58.920> tobacco<00:01:59.719> let's<00:02:00.719> see<00:02:00.869> if<00:02:00.990> it's<00:02:01.140> the

00:02:01.249 --> 00:02:01.259 
go over to tobacco let's see if it's the

00:02:01.259 --> 00:02:04.550 
go over to tobacco let's see if it's the
same<00:02:01.290> so<00:02:01.920> if<00:02:01.979> i<00:02:02.040> break<00:02:02.189> the<00:02:02.340> top<00:02:02.549> I<00:02:03.170> get<00:02:04.170> one

00:02:04.550 --> 00:02:04.560 
same so if i break the top I get one

00:02:04.560 --> 00:02:09.600 
same so if i break the top I get one
seed<00:02:05.240> one<00:02:06.240> leaf<00:02:06.979> and<00:02:07.979> it<00:02:08.340> does<00:02:08.489> not

00:02:09.600 --> 00:02:09.610 
seed one leaf and it does not

00:02:09.610 --> 00:02:13.470 
seed one leaf and it does not
come<00:02:10.119> on<00:02:10.270> let's<00:02:11.080> see<00:02:11.290> if<00:02:11.380> I<00:02:11.500> can<00:02:12.210> get<00:02:13.210> rid<00:02:13.450> of

00:02:13.470 --> 00:02:13.480 
come on let's see if I can get rid of

00:02:13.480 --> 00:02:17.130 
come on let's see if I can get rid of
these<00:02:13.720> and<00:02:14.140> see<00:02:14.500> what<00:02:14.680> if<00:02:14.890> I<00:02:15.220> get<00:02:15.490> another<00:02:16.140> drug

00:02:17.130 --> 00:02:17.140 
these and see what if I get another drug

00:02:17.140 --> 00:02:20.910 
these and see what if I get another drug
from<00:02:17.560> another<00:02:18.130> plant<00:02:18.610> part<00:02:18.940> from<00:02:19.180> it<00:02:19.650> if<00:02:20.650> i<00:02:20.710> get

00:02:20.910 --> 00:02:20.920 
from another plant part from it if i get

00:02:20.920 --> 00:02:26.020 
from another plant part from it if i get
rid<00:02:21.070> of<00:02:21.160> all<00:02:21.310> these

00:02:26.020 --> 00:02:26.030 

00:02:26.030 --> 00:02:29.530 

alright<00:02:26.660> let's<00:02:26.900> try<00:02:26.990> this<00:02:27.140> again

00:02:29.530 --> 00:02:29.540 

00:02:29.540 --> 00:02:35.289 

okay<00:02:30.230> so<00:02:30.920> if<00:02:31.129> I<00:02:31.219> break<00:02:31.459> the<00:02:31.640> top<00:02:31.879> I<00:02:33.700> receive<00:02:34.700> the

00:02:35.289 --> 00:02:35.299 
okay so if I break the top I receive the

00:02:35.299 --> 00:02:38.410 
okay so if I break the top I receive the
seat<00:02:35.629> tobacco<00:02:35.989> seeds<00:02:36.290> and<00:02:36.530> tobacco<00:02:36.799> leaves<00:02:37.420> if

00:02:38.410 --> 00:02:38.420 
seat tobacco seeds and tobacco leaves if

00:02:38.420 --> 00:02:43.209 
seat tobacco seeds and tobacco leaves if
I<00:02:38.510> break<00:02:38.689> the<00:02:38.840> bottom<00:02:41.650> you<00:02:42.650> do<00:02:42.769> not<00:02:42.859> receive

creative mode so if you break the bottom

00:02:49.250 --> 00:02:51.460 
creative mode so if you break the bottom
you<00:02:49.579> receive<00:02:49.879> the<00:02:50.060> seeds<00:02:50.359> oh<00:02:50.599> the<00:02:51.109> seeds<00:02:51.349> and

00:02:53.610 --> 00:02:53.620 
the tobacco leaves you break the top

00:02:53.620 --> 00:02:56.170 
the tobacco leaves you break the top
receive<00:02:54.620> the<00:02:54.739> seeds<00:02:55.069> a<00:02:55.159> sabbatical<00:02:55.459> leaves<00:02:55.760> so

00:02:56.170 --> 00:02:56.180 
receive the seeds a sabbatical leaves so

00:02:56.180 --> 00:02:57.910 
receive the seeds a sabbatical leaves so
it's<00:02:56.299> only<00:02:56.569> the<00:02:56.689> hemp<00:02:56.930> plant<00:02:57.019> that<00:02:57.650> if<00:02:57.829> you

00:02:57.910 --> 00:02:57.920 
it's only the hemp plant that if you

00:02:57.920 --> 00:03:00.720 
it's only the hemp plant that if you
break<00:02:58.159> the<00:02:58.340> bottom<00:02:58.790> you<00:02:59.420> do<00:02:59.540> not<00:02:59.750> receive<00:03:00.200> the

00:03:00.720 --> 00:03:00.730 
break the bottom you do not receive the

00:03:00.730 --> 00:03:07.449 
break the bottom you do not receive the
seeds<00:03:02.620> okay<00:03:03.760> so<00:03:04.760> that's<00:03:05.599> the<00:03:06.280> statistics<00:03:07.280> and

00:03:07.449 --> 00:03:07.459 
seeds okay so that's the statistics and

00:03:07.459 --> 00:03:14.550 
seeds okay so that's the statistics and
the<00:03:07.609> coding<00:03:07.909> behind<00:03:08.180> the<00:03:08.239> plants

00:03:14.550 --> 00:03:14.560 

00:03:14.560 --> 00:03:18.180 

now<00:03:15.130> let's<00:03:15.310> go<00:03:15.459> into<00:03:15.730> the<00:03:15.849> actual<00:03:17.040> planting<00:03:18.040> of

00:03:18.180 --> 00:03:18.190 
now let's go into the actual planting of

00:03:18.190 --> 00:03:21.420 
now let's go into the actual planting of
them<00:03:18.660> so<00:03:19.660> if<00:03:19.720> we<00:03:19.780> go<00:03:19.900> in<00:03:20.020> here<00:03:20.319> get<00:03:21.099> some<00:03:21.130> bone

00:03:21.420 --> 00:03:21.430 
them so if we go in here get some bone

00:03:21.430 --> 00:03:28.860 
them so if we go in here get some bone
marrow<00:03:22.080> let's<00:03:23.080> get<00:03:23.200> some<00:03:23.410> seeds<00:03:23.680> of<00:03:23.890> both

00:03:28.860 --> 00:03:28.870 

00:03:28.870 --> 00:03:31.199 

so<00:03:29.470> for<00:03:30.010> the<00:03:30.159> let's<00:03:30.610> start<00:03:30.700> with<00:03:30.849> the<00:03:31.000> toque

00:03:31.199 --> 00:03:31.209 
so for the let's start with the toque

00:03:31.209 --> 00:03:33.750 
so for the let's start with the toque
exceeds<00:03:31.920> the<00:03:32.920> actual<00:03:33.220> hemp<00:03:33.370> plant<00:03:33.580> goes

00:03:33.750 --> 00:03:33.760 
exceeds the actual hemp plant goes

00:03:33.760 --> 00:03:35.039 
exceeds the actual hemp plant goes
through<00:03:33.970> four<00:03:34.150> different<00:03:34.390> stages<00:03:34.599> those

00:03:35.039 --> 00:03:35.049 
through four different stages those

00:03:35.049 --> 00:03:38.160 
through four different stages those
through<00:03:35.290> the<00:03:35.409> first<00:03:35.620> two<00:03:35.830> sumbody<00:03:36.670> three<00:03:37.170> four

00:03:38.160 --> 00:03:38.170 
through the first two sumbody three four

00:03:38.170 --> 00:03:41.729 
through the first two sumbody three four
now<00:03:38.409> it's<00:03:39.010> fully<00:03:39.220> grown<00:03:39.489> with<00:03:40.450> and<00:03:41.080> it<00:03:41.470> used<00:03:41.620> to

00:03:41.729 --> 00:03:41.739 
now it's fully grown with and it used to

00:03:41.739 --> 00:03:44.670 
now it's fully grown with and it used to
be<00:03:41.830> you<00:03:41.860> could<00:03:41.950> not<00:03:42.190> use<00:03:42.569> bone<00:03:43.569> marrow<00:03:43.810> now<00:03:44.620> you

00:03:44.670 --> 00:03:44.680 
be you could not use bone marrow now you

00:03:44.680 --> 00:03:46.229 
be you could not use bone marrow now you
can't<00:03:44.980> a<00:03:45.040> bone<00:03:45.220> meal<00:03:45.400> now<00:03:45.610> you<00:03:45.670> can<00:03:45.909> so<00:03:46.120> that's

00:03:46.229 --> 00:03:46.239 
can't a bone meal now you can so that's

00:03:46.239 --> 00:03:47.819 
can't a bone meal now you can so that's
the<00:03:46.360> first<00:03:46.510> stage<00:03:46.750> of<00:03:46.840> tobacco<00:03:47.140> second<00:03:47.650> stage

00:03:47.819 --> 00:03:47.829 
the first stage of tobacco second stage

00:03:47.829 --> 00:03:50.490 
the first stage of tobacco second stage
third<00:03:48.400> stage<00:03:48.730> and<00:03:49.000> fourth<00:03:49.329> stage<00:03:49.599> so<00:03:50.290> you<00:03:50.379> can

00:03:50.490 --> 00:03:50.500 
third stage and fourth stage so you can

00:03:50.500 --> 00:03:51.990 
third stage and fourth stage so you can
now<00:03:50.590> use<00:03:50.799> bone<00:03:51.010> meal<00:03:51.250> for<00:03:51.459> these<00:03:51.549> plants<00:03:51.879> which

00:03:51.990 --> 00:03:52.000 
now use bone meal for these plants which

00:03:52.000 --> 00:03:54.479 
now use bone meal for these plants which
will<00:03:52.120> definitely<00:03:52.930> help<00:03:53.110> people<00:03:53.440> in<00:03:53.590> creating

00:03:54.479 --> 00:03:54.489 
will definitely help people in creating

00:03:54.489 --> 00:03:59.280 
will definitely help people in creating
giant<00:03:54.700> farms<00:03:56.099> the<00:03:57.099> third<00:03:57.370> way<00:03:57.930> we'll<00:03:58.930> start<00:03:59.170> at

00:03:59.280 --> 00:03:59.290 
giant farms the third way we'll start at

00:03:59.290 --> 00:04:02.640 
giant farms the third way we'll start at
will<00:03:59.590> go<00:03:59.739> with<00:03:59.950> the<00:04:00.040> shrooms<00:04:00.370> now<00:04:01.410> it's<00:04:02.410> been<00:04:02.620> a

00:04:02.640 --> 00:04:02.650 
will go with the shrooms now it's been a

00:04:02.650 --> 00:04:06.420 
will go with the shrooms now it's been a
while<00:04:02.859> for<00:04:03.459> shrooms<00:04:04.180> to<00:04:04.329> be<00:04:04.599> to<00:04:04.989> work<00:04:05.250> the<00:04:06.250> best

00:04:06.420 --> 00:04:06.430 
while for shrooms to be to work the best

00:04:06.430 --> 00:04:10.380 
while for shrooms to be to work the best
method<00:04:06.879> for<00:04:06.910> growing<00:04:07.329> shrooms<00:04:07.690> is<00:04:09.239> first<00:04:10.239> you

00:04:10.380 --> 00:04:10.390 
method for growing shrooms is first you

00:04:10.390 --> 00:04:15.470 
method for growing shrooms is first you
get<00:04:10.510> a<00:04:10.540> water<00:04:10.810> bucket

00:04:15.470 --> 00:04:15.480 

00:04:15.480 --> 00:04:20.180 

then<00:04:16.079> you<00:04:16.229> need<00:04:16.320> some<00:04:16.530> bone<00:04:16.799> meal<00:04:17.930> and<00:04:19.190> need

00:04:20.180 --> 00:04:20.190 
then you need some bone meal and need

00:04:20.190 --> 00:04:22.640 
then you need some bone meal and need
the<00:04:20.220> shrooms<00:04:20.609> so<00:04:21.479> you<00:04:21.570> dig<00:04:21.750> a<00:04:21.780> hole<00:04:22.019> down<00:04:22.260> one

00:04:22.640 --> 00:04:22.650 
the shrooms so you dig a hole down one

00:04:22.650 --> 00:04:26.060 
the shrooms so you dig a hole down one
block<00:04:22.770> and<00:04:23.750> you<00:04:24.750> put<00:04:24.990> water<00:04:25.260> in<00:04:25.470> it<00:04:25.530> and<00:04:25.710> the

00:04:26.060 --> 00:04:26.070 
block and you put water in it and the

00:04:26.070 --> 00:04:29.750 
block and you put water in it and the
reason<00:04:26.250> is<00:04:26.669> is<00:04:26.880> because<00:04:27.440> the<00:04:28.490> you<00:04:29.490> know<00:04:29.639> how

00:04:29.750 --> 00:04:29.760 
reason is is because the you know how

00:04:29.760 --> 00:04:31.460 
reason is is because the you know how
when<00:04:29.910> you<00:04:30.000> go<00:04:30.090> underwater<00:04:30.449> everything<00:04:31.290> gets

00:04:31.460 --> 00:04:31.470 
when you go underwater everything gets

00:04:31.470 --> 00:04:36.909 
when you go underwater everything gets
darker<00:04:31.889> right<00:04:32.210> so<00:04:33.210> the<00:04:33.750> the<00:04:34.680> light<00:04:35.419> the<00:04:36.419> reason

00:04:36.909 --> 00:04:36.919 
darker right so the the light the reason

00:04:36.919 --> 00:04:40.219 
darker right so the the light the reason
shrooms<00:04:37.919> don't<00:04:38.160> usually<00:04:38.280> grow<00:04:38.930> you<00:04:39.930> can't

00:04:40.219 --> 00:04:40.229 
shrooms don't usually grow you can't

00:04:40.229 --> 00:04:42.590 
shrooms don't usually grow you can't
grow<00:04:40.530> shrooms<00:04:41.010> place<00:04:41.669> down<00:04:41.880> shrooms<00:04:42.240> in<00:04:42.389> the

00:04:42.590 --> 00:04:42.600 
grow shrooms place down shrooms in the

00:04:42.600 --> 00:04:44.659 
grow shrooms place down shrooms in the
upper<00:04:43.020> world<00:04:43.169> is<00:04:43.470> because<00:04:44.130> it's<00:04:44.280> not<00:04:44.370> dark

00:04:44.659 --> 00:04:44.669 
upper world is because it's not dark

00:04:44.669 --> 00:04:46.280 
upper world is because it's not dark
enough<00:04:44.790> it<00:04:45.330> only<00:04:45.449> dark<00:04:45.750> enough<00:04:45.900> in<00:04:46.020> the<00:04:46.080> nether

00:04:46.280 --> 00:04:46.290 
enough it only dark enough in the nether

00:04:46.290 --> 00:04:50.000 
enough it only dark enough in the nether
so<00:04:47.070> this<00:04:47.699> makes<00:04:48.210> the<00:04:48.539> area<00:04:48.870> around<00:04:49.530> their

00:04:50.000 --> 00:04:50.010 
so this makes the area around their

00:04:50.010 --> 00:04:52.370 
so this makes the area around their
darker<00:04:50.520> so<00:04:51.000> I<00:04:51.030> can<00:04:51.330> actually<00:04:51.479> place<00:04:51.900> one<00:04:52.229> in

00:04:52.370 --> 00:04:52.380 
darker so I can actually place one in

00:04:52.380 --> 00:04:55.430 
darker so I can actually place one in
there<00:04:52.590> and<00:04:52.830> take<00:04:53.820> some<00:04:53.850> bone<00:04:54.150> meal<00:04:54.330> and<00:04:54.570> I<00:04:54.960> now

00:04:55.430 --> 00:04:55.440 
there and take some bone meal and I now

00:04:55.440 --> 00:04:58.580 
there and take some bone meal and I now
have<00:04:55.680> a<00:04:55.949> mushroom<00:04:56.490> a<00:04:56.699> giant<00:04:57.449> mushroom<00:04:57.780> so<00:04:58.470> now

00:04:58.580 --> 00:04:58.590 
have a mushroom a giant mushroom so now

00:04:58.590 --> 00:04:59.629 
have a mushroom a giant mushroom so now
if<00:04:58.740> you<00:04:58.830> break<00:04:58.979> that<00:04:59.160> you<00:04:59.280> get<00:04:59.400> mushrooms

00:04:59.629 --> 00:04:59.639 
if you break that you get mushrooms

00:04:59.639 --> 00:05:01.129 
if you break that you get mushrooms
every<00:04:59.970> time<00:05:00.120> so<00:05:00.300> that's<00:05:00.419> the<00:05:00.539> fastest<00:05:00.870> way<00:05:00.960> of

00:05:01.129 --> 00:05:01.139 
every time so that's the fastest way of

00:05:01.139 --> 00:05:05.600 
every time so that's the fastest way of
growing<00:05:01.289> shrooms<00:05:02.100> and<00:05:02.520> the<00:05:02.880> same<00:05:03.060> goes<00:05:04.610> for

00:05:05.600 --> 00:05:05.610 
growing shrooms and the same goes for

00:05:05.610 --> 00:05:10.430 
growing shrooms and the same goes for
brown<00:05:05.940> shrooms

00:05:10.430 --> 00:05:10.440 

00:05:10.440 --> 00:05:12.740 

so<00:05:11.040> I<00:05:11.070> get<00:05:11.400> a<00:05:11.460> giant<00:05:11.700> brown<00:05:11.910> mushroom<00:05:12.360> and<00:05:12.660> you

00:05:12.740 --> 00:05:12.750 
so I get a giant brown mushroom and you

00:05:12.750 --> 00:05:14.000 
so I get a giant brown mushroom and you
break<00:05:12.930> those<00:05:13.110> and<00:05:13.320> you<00:05:13.380> get<00:05:13.500> the<00:05:13.590> parts<00:05:13.860> of<00:05:13.950> the

00:05:14.000 --> 00:05:14.010 
break those and you get the parts of the

00:05:14.010 --> 00:05:15.920 
break those and you get the parts of the
shroom<00:05:14.250> and<00:05:14.490> then<00:05:15.000> you<00:05:15.090> can<00:05:15.240> go<00:05:15.450> into<00:05:15.870> the

00:05:15.920 --> 00:05:15.930 
shroom and then you can go into the

00:05:15.930 --> 00:05:17.600 
shroom and then you can go into the
drawing<00:05:16.110> table<00:05:16.290> but<00:05:16.560> that's<00:05:16.710> different<00:05:16.890> so

00:05:17.600 --> 00:05:17.610 
drawing table but that's different so

00:05:17.610 --> 00:05:19.390 
drawing table but that's different so
