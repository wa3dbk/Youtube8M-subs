00:00:01.950 --> 00:00:06.720
 hello community friends by that I am 

00:00:04.290 --> 00:00:09.780
 also 206 

00:00:06.720 --> 00:00:11.769
 and nothing today I want to talk about something 

00:00:09.780 --> 00:00:15.610
 that really 

00:00:11.769 --> 00:00:18.220
 is affecting luckily to us not 

00:00:15.610 --> 00:00:20.680
 could we have not had ls but several 

00:00:18.220 --> 00:00:23.680
 some known that another we have 

00:00:20.680 --> 00:00:25.010
 that has also fallen victim to the 

00:00:23.680 --> 00:00:28.040
 transsexual 

00:00:25.010 --> 00:00:31.870
 Traps for cyclists that you do not know 

00:00:28.040 --> 00:00:35.960
 reason why people were talking out there 

00:00:31.870 --> 00:00:37.940
 of only one and not where the 

00:00:35.960 --> 00:00:40.750
 writing we will do one will have tocas usa 

00:00:37.940 --> 00:00:43.310
 cases perhaps the king 

00:00:40.750 --> 00:00:46.220
 Well yes the truth that all the traps 

00:00:43.310 --> 00:00:48.480
 in a fucking because it is no longer that you 

00:00:46.220 --> 00:00:55.030
 drop air 

00:00:48.480 --> 00:00:56.590
 click on the bicycle or have less 

00:00:55.030 --> 00:00:58.239
 problems when it already affects you 

00:00:56.590 --> 00:01:01.050
 directly to what is physical health 

00:00:58.239 --> 00:01:01.050
 even to life 

00:01:01.270 --> 00:01:07.450
 because we can see all the networks 

00:01:04.480 --> 00:01:10.140
 social now the large amount tells us 

00:01:07.450 --> 00:01:13.380
 that come out about it both twitter 

00:01:10.140 --> 00:01:15.970
 facebook and other people who also 

00:01:13.380 --> 00:01:18.460
 incited some traps for the 

00:01:15.970 --> 00:01:20.010
 cyclists for motorcycles also passes 

00:01:18.460 --> 00:01:25.090
 that the motorbike drunk bourgeois hours 

00:01:20.010 --> 00:01:28.720
 circulate less through the mountains and so on if 

00:01:25.090 --> 00:01:29.979
 we have the from the typical stone the 

00:01:28.720 --> 00:01:33.100
 half of the being that you find them 

00:01:29.979 --> 00:01:36.580
 when you go down to pass the curve 

00:01:33.100 --> 00:01:40.780
 the typical leaking table 

00:01:36.580 --> 00:01:44.200
 for insider ditches I talked about 

00:01:40.780 --> 00:01:46.150
 size and then is and is seen to 

00:01:44.200 --> 00:01:48.430
 it's milk and that's probably the one that 

00:01:46.150 --> 00:01:52.740
 I think it looks like it's ready 

00:01:48.430 --> 00:01:52.740
 the cross change at the height of the post 

00:01:54.060 --> 00:01:59.759
 and you can not say anything that we 're going to see 

00:01:56.369 --> 00:02:02.399
 if we are a little aware that by 

00:01:59.759 --> 00:02:04.799
 the mountain circulates we go all people in 

00:02:02.399 --> 00:02:08.640
 bicycle people of the world people walking 

00:02:04.799 --> 00:02:10.319
 people who hunt because it is already very easy 

00:02:08.640 --> 00:02:12.540
 blame the hunters or 

00:02:10.319 --> 00:02:14.720
 blame the hikers or 

00:02:12.540 --> 00:02:17.069
 blame the owners of 

00:02:14.720 --> 00:02:21.290
 the farms 

00:02:17.069 --> 00:02:21.290
 guilty we are nobody and we are all 

00:02:21.490 --> 00:02:28.240
 and since I'm going to tell you what we do 

00:02:24.790 --> 00:02:30.250
 the favor of concentrating a bit because 

00:02:28.240 --> 00:02:32.140
 We're not playing not only after 

00:02:30.250 --> 00:02:35.580
 go through one site for another but that 

00:02:32.140 --> 00:02:38.880
 we are already playing with people's lives 

00:02:35.580 --> 00:02:43.790
 and little more than community we mean 

00:02:38.880 --> 00:02:43.790
 that we have public head 

00:02:44.840 --> 00:02:48.430
 I'll leave it to you
