that<00:01:27.659> seems<00:01:27.869> to<00:01:27.930> not<00:01:28.049> actually<00:01:28.229> work<00:01:28.500> very

00:01:28.700 --> 00:01:28.710 
that seems to not actually work very

00:01:28.710 --> 00:01:30.730 
that seems to not actually work very
well<00:01:28.740> but<00:01:29.070> that'll<00:01:29.579> hurt<00:01:29.670> alien<00:01:30.030> armor<00:01:30.240> and

00:01:30.730 --> 00:01:30.740

you use your jetpack now it used to be
you<00:02:22.489> hold<00:02:22.640> down<00:02:22.790> the<00:02:22.879> spacebar<00:02:23.150> and<00:02:23.569> you<00:02:23.629> would

00:02:23.740 --> 00:02:23.750 
you hold down the spacebar and you would

00:02:23.750 --> 00:02:25.300 
you hold down the spacebar and you would
just<00:02:23.780> jet<00:02:24.110> around<00:02:24.409> now<00:02:24.739> the<00:02:24.769> way<00:02:24.980> it<00:02:25.069> works<00:02:25.099> you

00:02:25.300 --> 00:02:25.310 
just jet around now the way it works you

00:02:25.310 --> 00:02:26.710 
just jet around now the way it works you
hold<00:02:25.519> down<00:02:25.640> your<00:02:25.670> spacebar<00:02:26.030> you<00:02:26.329> will<00:02:26.450> jump

00:02:26.710 --> 00:02:26.720 
hold down your spacebar you will jump

00:02:26.720 --> 00:02:28.390 
hold down your spacebar you will jump
first<00:02:27.049> and<00:02:27.290> then<00:02:27.409> the<00:02:27.530> jetpack<00:02:27.890> will<00:02:28.069> kick<00:02:28.250> in

00:02:28.390 --> 00:02:28.400 
first and then the jetpack will kick in

00:02:28.400 --> 00:02:30.399 
first and then the jetpack will kick in
so<00:02:29.030> this<00:02:29.209> means<00:02:29.450> you<00:02:29.659> can<00:02:29.780> go<00:02:29.870> around<00:02:29.959> jumping

so this means you can go around jumping
not<00:02:30.650> using<00:02:30.920> any<00:02:31.069> jetpack<00:02:31.430> energy<00:02:31.790> and<00:02:31.940> you<00:02:32.000> can

00:02:32.140 --> 00:02:32.150 
not using any jetpack energy and you can

00:02:32.150 --> 00:02:33.850 
not using any jetpack energy and you can
also<00:02:32.269> get<00:02:32.420> a<00:02:32.659> little<00:02:32.900> higher<00:02:33.170> with<00:02:33.739> your

up<00:02:55.010> I<00:02:55.129> think<00:02:55.190> you<00:02:55.400> can't<00:02:55.609> be<00:02:55.760> catalyst<00:02:56.239> packed

up I think you can't be catalyst packed

00:02:56.480 --> 00:02:58.509 
up I think you can't be catalyst packed
again<00:02:56.690> so<00:02:57.109> you<00:02:57.170> cannot<00:02:57.470> be<00:02:57.590> catalyst<00:02:58.069> to<00:02:58.250> spam

00:02:58.509 --> 00:02:58.519 
again so you cannot be catalyst to spam

00:02:58.519 --> 00:03:00.729 
again so you cannot be catalyst to spam
the<00:02:58.819> way<00:02:58.909> you<00:02:58.970> can<00:02:59.150> be<00:02:59.269> med<00:02:59.840> pack<00:03:00.109> spam<00:03:00.470> there's

00:03:00.729 --> 00:03:00.739 
the way you can be med pack spam there's

00:03:00.739 --> 00:03:01.780 
the way you can be med pack spam there's
also<00:03:00.859> something<00:03:01.129> I<00:03:01.250> think<00:03:01.310> I<00:03:01.489> forgot<00:03:01.700> to

without<00:03:11.750> power<00:03:12.230> and<00:03:12.680> that<00:03:13.459> I<00:03:13.519> think<00:03:13.790> it's<00:03:14.030> all

00:03:14.199 --> 00:03:14.209 
without power and that I think it's all

without power and that I think it's all
changes<00:03:14.810> to<00:03:15.049> the<00:03:15.440> Marines<00:03:15.650> in<00:03:15.739> this<00:03:15.829> patch<00:03:16.010> so

00:03:17.329 --> 00:03:20.680 
obviously the grenades and all that
stuff<00:03:17.510> adds<00:03:17.750> quite<00:03:18.560> a<00:03:18.650> bit<00:03:18.859> of<00:03:19.040> new<00:03:19.849> things<00:03:20.510> for

their movement down
quite<00:04:14.790> a<00:04:14.820> bit<00:04:15.060> and<00:04:15.270> so<00:04:15.600> you<00:04:15.660> just<00:04:16.049> go<00:04:16.200> into<00:04:16.320> your

00:04:16.400 --> 00:04:16.410 
quite a bit and so you just go into your

00:04:16.410 --> 00:04:18.620 
quite a bit and so you just go into your
build<00:04:16.650> menu<00:04:16.950> and<00:04:17.250> you<00:04:17.400> lay<00:04:17.580> a<00:04:17.610> web<00:04:17.910> on<00:04:18.120> one<00:04:18.360> side

00:04:18.620 --> 00:04:18.630 
build menu and you lay a web on one side

00:04:18.630 --> 00:04:20.240 
build menu and you lay a web on one side
and<00:04:18.900> the<00:04:18.989> other<00:04:19.019> it's<00:04:19.680> a<00:04:19.830> little<00:04:20.070> confusing

and the other it's a little confusing

00:04:20.250 --> 00:04:22.190 
and the other it's a little confusing
because<00:04:20.700> while<00:04:21.060> you're<00:04:21.209> laying<00:04:21.360> the<00:04:21.570> web<00:04:21.750> you

00:04:22.190 --> 00:04:22.200 
because while you're laying the web you

00:04:22.200 --> 00:04:23.930 
because while you're laying the web you
see<00:04:22.350> I<00:04:22.380> click<00:04:22.650> right<00:04:22.860> here<00:04:22.890> and<00:04:23.190> I<00:04:23.790> actually

00:04:23.930 --> 00:04:23.940 
see I click right here and I actually

00:04:23.940 --> 00:04:25.550 
see I click right here and I actually
don't<00:04:24.210> see<00:04:24.330> any<00:04:24.570> indication<00:04:24.810> that<00:04:25.260> it<00:04:25.380> worked

00:04:25.550 --> 00:04:25.560 
don't see any indication that it worked

00:04:25.560 --> 00:04:28.070 
don't see any indication that it worked
until<00:04:25.740> I<00:04:25.920> build<00:04:26.160> the<00:04:26.250> second<00:04:26.550> and<00:04:27.150> there<00:04:27.690> I<00:04:27.720> go

00:04:28.070 --> 00:04:28.080 
until I build the second and there I go

00:04:28.080 --> 00:04:30.920 
until I build the second and there I go
so<00:04:28.230> webs<00:04:28.530> are<00:04:28.680> pretty<00:04:28.890> sweet<00:04:29.120> build<00:04:30.120> those<00:04:30.390> for

00:04:52.500 --> 00:04:53.630 
don't have to worry about that all we
have<00:04:52.590> to<00:04:52.680> worry<00:04:52.830> about<00:04:52.950> is<00:04:53.160> next<00:04:53.460> time<00:04:53.610> I

00:04:53.630 --> 00:04:53.640 
have to worry about is next time I

00:04:53.640 --> 00:04:57.980 
have to worry about is next time I
attack<00:04:54.030> somebody<00:04:56.030> zoom<00:04:57.030> right<00:04:57.510> back<00:04:57.720> to<00:04:57.870> the

00:04:57.980 --> 00:04:57.990 
attack somebody zoom right back to the

00:04:57.990 --> 00:04:59.570 
attack somebody zoom right back to the
vortex<00:04:58.200> so<00:04:58.530> you're<00:04:58.680> like<00:04:58.800> what<00:04:59.070> is<00:04:59.190> that<00:04:59.310> for

00:04:59.570 --> 00:04:59.580 
vortex so you're like what is that for

00:04:59.580 --> 00:05:01.100 
vortex so you're like what is that for
well<00:04:59.850> it's<00:05:00.120> pretty<00:05:00.420> sweet<00:05:00.690> because<00:05:00.900> you<00:05:00.960> get

00:05:01.100 --> 00:05:01.110 
well it's pretty sweet because you get

00:05:01.110 --> 00:05:02.210 
well it's pretty sweet because you get
one<00:05:01.140> free<00:05:01.470> attack<00:05:01.740> and<00:05:01.890> then<00:05:01.980> you<00:05:02.070> just

00:05:02.210 --> 00:05:02.220 
one free attack and then you just

00:05:02.220 --> 00:05:05.120 
one free attack and then you just
teleport<00:05:02.460> to<00:05:02.730> safety<00:05:03.060> so<00:05:03.960> use<00:05:04.170> that<00:05:04.200> sensibly

00:05:05.120 --> 00:05:05.130 
teleport to safety so use that sensibly

00:05:05.130 --> 00:05:07.820 
teleport to safety so use that sensibly
and<00:05:06.000> the<00:05:06.240> feint<00:05:06.450> now<00:05:06.630> has<00:05:06.840> a<00:05:06.870> new<00:05:07.140> attack<00:05:07.530> if

00:05:07.820 --> 00:05:07.830 
and the feint now has a new attack if

00:05:07.830 --> 00:05:09.440 
and the feint now has a new attack if
you<00:05:07.920> look<00:05:08.100> down<00:05:08.220> to<00:05:08.280> my<00:05:08.460> weapons<00:05:08.820> selection<00:05:09.270> I

00:05:09.440 --> 00:05:09.450 
you look down to my weapons selection I

00:05:09.450 --> 00:05:11.210 
you look down to my weapons selection I
have<00:05:09.570> one<00:05:09.870> which<00:05:10.170> is<00:05:10.290> the<00:05:10.410> normal<00:05:10.650> class<00:05:10.890> wipe

00:05:11.210 --> 00:05:11.220 
have one which is the normal class wipe

00:05:11.220 --> 00:05:12.980 
have one which is the normal class wipe
I<00:05:11.430> have<00:05:11.850> two<00:05:12.060> which<00:05:12.240> is<00:05:12.360> vortex<00:05:12.540> if<00:05:12.840> it's

00:05:12.980 --> 00:05:12.990 
I have two which is vortex if it's

00:05:12.990 --> 00:05:14.600 
I have two which is vortex if it's
research<00:05:13.380> and<00:05:13.500> I<00:05:13.590> have<00:05:13.620> three<00:05:13.950> which<00:05:14.160> is<00:05:14.340> I

00:05:14.600 --> 00:05:14.610 
research and I have three which is I

00:05:14.610 --> 00:05:15.740 
research and I have three which is I
don't<00:05:14.790> know<00:05:14.880> what<00:05:15.000> it's<00:05:15.120> called<00:05:15.270> but<00:05:15.420> it's

00:05:15.740 --> 00:05:15.750 
don't know what it's called but it's

00:05:15.750 --> 00:05:17.570 
don't know what it's called but it's
basically<00:05:16.050> much<00:05:16.260> more<00:05:16.470> powerful<00:05:16.920> and<00:05:17.130> an

00:05:17.570 --> 00:05:17.580 
basically much more powerful and an

00:05:17.580 --> 00:05:21.310 
basically much more powerful and an
attack<00:05:17.880> slower<00:05:18.270> and<00:05:18.570> it<00:05:19.140> takes<00:05:19.350> a<00:05:19.470> lot<00:05:19.650> of

00:05:21.310 --> 00:05:21.320 
attack slower and it takes a lot of

00:05:21.320 --> 00:05:23.330 
attack slower and it takes a lot of
energy<00:05:22.320> if<00:05:22.560> you<00:05:22.680> look<00:05:22.830> in<00:05:22.919> the<00:05:22.980> bottom<00:05:23.190> right

00:05:23.330 --> 00:05:23.340 
energy if you look in the bottom right

00:05:23.340 --> 00:05:24.890 
energy if you look in the bottom right
and<00:05:23.520> also<00:05:23.640> you<00:05:23.820> notice<00:05:24.090> my<00:05:24.300> movement<00:05:24.690> is<00:05:24.840> a

00:05:24.890 --> 00:05:24.900 
and also you notice my movement is a

00:05:24.900 --> 00:05:27.500 
and also you notice my movement is a
messed<00:05:25.830> up<00:05:26.010> while<00:05:26.430> I<00:05:26.460> click<00:05:26.790> the<00:05:26.940> button<00:05:26.970> so

00:05:27.500 --> 00:05:27.510 
messed up while I click the button so

00:05:27.510 --> 00:05:30.409 
messed up while I click the button so
that's<00:05:28.140> for<00:05:28.890> really<00:05:29.400> just<00:05:29.430> nailing<00:05:29.850> a<00:05:30.090> Marine

00:05:30.409 --> 00:05:30.419 
that's for really just nailing a Marine

00:05:30.419 --> 00:05:33.200 
that's for really just nailing a Marine
doesn't<00:05:31.410> really<00:05:31.530> good<00:05:31.710> DPS<00:05:32.100> but<00:05:32.130> uh<00:05:32.490> obviously

00:05:33.200 --> 00:05:33.210 
doesn't really good DPS but uh obviously

00:05:33.210 --> 00:05:34.610 
doesn't really good DPS but uh obviously
if<00:05:33.600> you<00:05:33.660> can't<00:05:33.840> land<00:05:34.020> that<00:05:34.260> you're<00:05:34.440> in<00:05:34.530> trouble

00:05:34.610 --> 00:05:34.620 
if you can't land that you're in trouble

00:05:34.620 --> 00:05:37.220 
if you can't land that you're in trouble
so<00:05:34.919> that's<00:05:35.160> the<00:05:35.310> new<00:05:35.430> fate<00:05:35.640> and<00:05:35.880> now<00:05:36.690> will<00:05:36.990> be

00:05:37.220 --> 00:05:37.230 
so that's the new fate and now will be

00:05:37.230 --> 00:05:40.850 
so that's the new fate and now will be
an<00:05:37.470> onus<00:05:37.770> on<00:05:38.419> us<00:05:39.419> got<00:05:39.660> some<00:05:39.810> neat<00:05:40.200> stuff<00:05:40.230> as

an onus on us got some neat stuff as
this<00:05:41.580> patch<00:05:41.820> the<00:05:42.540> honess<00:05:43.110> has<00:05:43.410> the<00:05:43.919> ona<00:05:44.220> stump

00:05:44.630 --> 00:05:44.640 
this patch the honess has the ona stump

00:05:44.640 --> 00:05:47.270 
this patch the honess has the ona stump
which<00:05:45.030> he<00:05:45.270> always<00:05:45.390> has<00:05:45.690> your<00:05:46.020> right-click<00:05:46.560> but

00:05:47.270 --> 00:05:47.280 
which he always has your right-click but

00:05:47.280 --> 00:05:49.460 
which he always has your right-click but
it<00:05:47.460> now<00:05:47.610> sort<00:05:47.850> of<00:05:47.940> travels<00:05:48.330> in<00:05:48.540> a<00:05:48.660> line<00:05:48.900> instead

00:05:49.460 --> 00:05:49.470 
it now sort of travels in a line instead

00:05:49.470 --> 00:05:51.350 
it now sort of travels in a line instead
of<00:05:49.590> being<00:05:49.770> instant<00:05:50.250> you<00:05:50.430> notice<00:05:50.700> these<00:05:51.030> front

00:05:51.350 --> 00:05:51.360 
of being instant you notice these front

00:05:51.360 --> 00:05:53.600 
of being instant you notice these front
Marines<00:05:51.660> fell<00:05:51.900> down<00:05:52.080> first<00:05:52.320> and<00:05:52.650> you<00:05:53.340> can<00:05:53.460> see

00:05:53.600 --> 00:05:53.610 
Marines fell down first and you can see

00:05:53.610 --> 00:05:55.280 
Marines fell down first and you can see
the<00:05:53.700> cracks<00:05:53.910> on<00:05:54.090> the<00:05:54.120> ground<00:05:54.360> if<00:05:54.600> you<00:05:54.630> jump<00:05:55.050> as

00:05:55.280 --> 00:05:55.290 
the cracks on the ground if you jump as

00:05:55.290 --> 00:05:56.810 
the cracks on the ground if you jump as
a<00:05:55.320> marine<00:05:55.680> while<00:05:56.010> the<00:05:56.100> onus<00:05:56.340> is<00:05:56.460> doing<00:05:56.700> this

00:05:56.810 --> 00:05:56.820 
a marine while the onus is doing this

00:05:56.820 --> 00:05:58.700 
a marine while the onus is doing this
and<00:05:57.120> you<00:05:57.180> managed<00:05:57.419> to<00:05:57.450> avoid<00:05:57.630> it<00:05:57.810> then<00:05:58.410> you

00:05:58.700 --> 00:05:58.710 
and you managed to avoid it then you

00:05:58.710 --> 00:06:00.770 
and you managed to avoid it then you
won't<00:05:58.890> get<00:05:59.310> knocked<00:05:59.790> down<00:06:00.120> so<00:06:00.450> there's<00:06:00.600> some

00:06:00.770 --> 00:06:00.780 
won't get knocked down so there's some

00:06:00.780 --> 00:06:01.850 
won't get knocked down so there's some
more<00:06:00.930> skill<00:06:01.169> there<00:06:01.320> and<00:06:01.470> you<00:06:01.530> noticed<00:06:01.800> that

00:06:01.850 --> 00:06:01.860 
more skill there and you noticed that

00:06:01.860 --> 00:06:04.600 
more skill there and you noticed that
didn't<00:06:02.370> seem<00:06:02.669> to<00:06:02.700> work<00:06:02.850> that<00:06:03.180> was<00:06:03.300> weird

00:06:04.600 --> 00:06:04.610 
didn't seem to work that was weird

00:06:04.610 --> 00:06:06.999 
didn't seem to work that was weird
there<00:06:05.240> we<00:06:05.389> go<00:06:05.509> and<00:06:05.750> the<00:06:06.229> second<00:06:06.740> thing<00:06:06.860> the

00:06:06.999 --> 00:06:07.009 
there we go and the second thing the

00:06:07.009 --> 00:06:08.770 
there we go and the second thing the
illness<00:06:07.250> has<00:06:07.280> is<00:06:07.699> an<00:06:07.849> attack<00:06:08.180> in<00:06:08.419> the<00:06:08.509> bottom

00:06:08.770 --> 00:06:08.780 
illness has is an attack in the bottom

00:06:08.780 --> 00:06:10.450 
illness has is an attack in the bottom
right<00:06:08.930> you<00:06:09.080> notice<00:06:09.349> it's<00:06:09.860> your<00:06:10.009> number<00:06:10.250> two

00:06:10.450 --> 00:06:10.460 
right you notice it's your number two

00:06:10.460 --> 00:06:12.010 
right you notice it's your number two
attack<00:06:10.879> if<00:06:11.090> the<00:06:11.180> commando<00:06:11.449> research<00:06:11.719> is<00:06:11.870> it

00:06:12.010 --> 00:06:12.020 
attack if the commando research is it

00:06:12.020 --> 00:06:14.260 
attack if the commando research is it
you<00:06:12.349> click<00:06:12.650> and<00:06:12.860> hold<00:06:13.250> down<00:06:13.460> and<00:06:13.729> it's<00:06:13.849> a<00:06:13.969> bone

00:06:14.260 --> 00:06:14.270 
you click and hold down and it's a bone

00:06:14.270 --> 00:06:16.360 
you click and hold down and it's a bone
shield<00:06:14.750> basically<00:06:15.409> while<00:06:15.860> you<00:06:15.979> do<00:06:16.099> this<00:06:16.250> you

00:06:16.360 --> 00:06:16.370 
shield basically while you do this you

00:06:16.370 --> 00:06:18.580 
shield basically while you do this you
cannot<00:06:16.699> move<00:06:16.939> and<00:06:17.210> you<00:06:17.300> crouch<00:06:17.509> down<00:06:17.539> but<00:06:18.439> you

00:06:18.580 --> 00:06:18.590 
cannot move and you crouch down but you

00:06:18.590 --> 00:06:20.050 
cannot move and you crouch down but you
basically<00:06:18.770> deflect<00:06:19.310> bullets<00:06:19.490> that<00:06:19.819> are<00:06:19.879> being

00:06:20.050 --> 00:06:20.060
