00:00:07.849 --> 00:00:11.519
 Welcome to the press conference 

00:00:09.809 --> 00:00:13.110
 after the second league encounter between 

00:00:11.519 --> 00:00:14.870
 fortuna düsseldorf from the first fc 

00:00:13.110 --> 00:00:20.100
 Kaiserslautern with both trainers 

00:00:14.870 --> 00:00:22.320
 At first yes, I think we are very good 

00:00:20.100 --> 00:00:24.720
 got into the game with the early one 

00:00:22.320 --> 00:00:28.560
 I would have even more guidance 

00:00:24.720 --> 00:00:32.369
 Ball control and and and and game control 

00:00:28.560 --> 00:00:35.969
 We wanted that from our point of view 

00:00:32.369 --> 00:00:38.370
 made up to 35 minutes very neat 

00:00:35.969 --> 00:00:40.950
 but not as in shape as I feel 

00:00:38.370 --> 00:00:43.890
 would have liked and the village has then 

00:00:40.950 --> 00:00:46.440
 also found the access to the game 

00:00:43.890 --> 00:00:47.789
 and how to guide you in the 

00:00:46.440 --> 00:00:49.230
 gone halfway knowing that 

00:00:47.789 --> 00:00:52.379
 düsseldorf a second very much 

00:00:49.230 --> 00:00:53.940
 This will still put pressure on us 

00:00:52.379 --> 00:00:56.309
 risk everything 

00:00:53.940 --> 00:00:57.719
 they did that too, we did 

00:00:56.309 --> 00:00:58.800
 not many at the second half 

00:00:57.719 --> 00:01:03.660
 solutions and I had many 

00:00:58.800 --> 00:01:08.760
 have had opportunities in the game forward 

00:01:03.660 --> 00:01:11.159
 we have to look at that again 

00:01:08.760 --> 00:01:14.369
 and we have to do this reproach 

00:01:11.159 --> 00:01:17.369
 but we have until the 89th 

00:01:14.369 --> 00:01:19.890
 minute guided and in the end was the game 

00:01:17.369 --> 00:01:21.780
 not on our side we take one 

00:01:19.890 --> 00:01:28.710
 take away piece of experience 

00:01:21.780 --> 00:01:31.380
 continue with when I see ours 

00:01:28.710 --> 00:01:33.170
 team even if they are in the second 

00:01:31.380 --> 00:01:36.750
 half time was powerful under pressure 

00:01:33.170 --> 00:01:40.170
 has been fighting in every ball 

00:01:36.750 --> 00:01:42.659
 has thrown in and to the end 

00:01:40.170 --> 00:01:43.170
 Everything has given me that makes me 

00:01:42.659 --> 00:01:47.009
 proud 

00:01:43.170 --> 00:01:50.159
 that's certainly the right approach 

00:01:47.009 --> 00:01:53.520
 Now we have to look a bit 

00:01:50.159 --> 00:01:56.100
 shake and process this game 

00:01:53.520 --> 00:01:58.229
 and then in the next game with one 

00:01:56.100 --> 00:02:00.329
 similar field but still with 

00:01:58.229 --> 00:02:01.240
 Better football at home on the 

00:02:00.329 --> 00:02:04.479
 betz mountain 

00:02:01.240 --> 00:02:06.250
 yes get the necessary points I think 

00:02:04.479 --> 00:02:08.729
 if today other face of fortuna 

00:02:06.250 --> 00:02:10.929
 seen düsseldorf 

00:02:08.729 --> 00:02:12.790
 Dieter of course the beginning of the order 

00:02:10.929 --> 00:02:14.230
 of the game with the first attack of the 

00:02:12.790 --> 00:02:16.440
 opponents against us again over it 

00:02:14.230 --> 00:02:19.090
 we with 0 1 behind 

00:02:16.440 --> 00:02:21.459
 Of course the team was as well 

00:02:19.090 --> 00:02:25.630
 unsettled that does not contribute to 

00:02:21.459 --> 00:02:27.819
 additional safety should be included 

00:02:25.630 --> 00:02:30.099
 surely it fits surely nonetheless 

00:02:27.819 --> 00:02:32.709
 At least we do not have much 

00:02:30.099 --> 00:02:34.080
 admitted then got better and better 

00:02:32.709 --> 00:02:36.340
 play have increased us 

00:02:34.080 --> 00:02:37.450
 again and again about the wings today 

00:02:36.340 --> 00:02:39.549
 the game plan that we many 

00:02:37.450 --> 00:02:40.420
 playing diagonal balls and then and are 

00:02:39.549 --> 00:02:42.610
 neither prevail in one-on-one 

00:02:40.420 --> 00:02:44.170
 or winning the race and me 

00:02:42.610 --> 00:02:45.400
 think first half are very much 

00:02:44.170 --> 00:02:47.830
 many sharp flank in the penalty area 

00:02:45.400 --> 00:02:49.510
 flown in where we always go back 

00:02:47.830 --> 00:02:52.810
 Step too late came very well 

00:02:49.510 --> 00:02:54.280
 defended, however, has a giant goal 

00:02:52.810 --> 00:02:56.590
 chance by charlie workshop after the 

00:02:54.280 --> 00:02:58.930
 You can calm down the ball 

00:02:56.590 --> 00:03:00.010
 then it is already 1 1 at half-time me 

00:02:58.930 --> 00:03:01.660
 I said halfway that we 

00:03:00.010 --> 00:03:03.880
 continue to be at one piece 

00:03:01.660 --> 00:03:05.320
 I have to invest more 

00:03:03.880 --> 00:03:08.410
 happy with the first half 

00:03:05.320 --> 00:03:09.850
 and then the boys have to believe it 

00:03:08.410 --> 00:03:12.280
 that we continue to work which must now 

00:03:09.850 --> 00:03:13.269
 that we will be rewarded in the end 

00:03:12.280 --> 00:03:15.190
 I am lucky after a fairly wide 

00:03:13.269 --> 00:03:16.690
 we everything in the second half 

00:03:15.190 --> 00:03:18.190
 she tried to switch offensively 

00:03:16.690 --> 00:03:19.750
 the team did that very well 

00:03:18.190 --> 00:03:23.590
 yes still the suitcase giant Kopfballchance 

00:03:19.750 --> 00:03:25.570
 to straw three four good shots where they 

00:03:23.590 --> 00:03:27.100
 So far, good luck keeps the header from 

00:03:25.570 --> 00:03:28.600
 close by are a few shots of and 

00:03:27.100 --> 00:03:29.920
 axel bellinghausen is blocked off 

00:03:28.600 --> 00:03:31.720
 michael angel being blocked 

00:03:29.920 --> 00:03:34.480
 I think that was undecided 

00:03:31.720 --> 00:03:36.700
 more than deserved and I have that 

00:03:34.480 --> 00:03:38.489
 Team just said that's it 

00:03:36.700 --> 00:03:41.470
 level of the most demanding I take them fair 

00:03:38.489 --> 00:03:43.709
 and we try that constantly 

00:03:41.470 --> 00:03:48.280
 this achievement this willingness this 

00:03:43.709 --> 00:03:50.079
 show passion then we would be now 

00:03:48.280 --> 00:03:52.150
 not where currently are but as I said 

00:03:50.079 --> 00:03:53.380
 that's just the problem at the moment 

00:03:52.150 --> 00:03:56.230
 many have injured that one may 

00:03:53.380 --> 00:03:57.639
 not forgetting complete squad 

00:03:56.230 --> 00:03:58.239
 You also have more possibilities as a trainer 

00:03:57.639 --> 00:04:01.359
 switch 

00:03:58.239 --> 00:04:02.590
 more try to apply pressure but that 

00:04:01.359 --> 00:04:03.609
 is the state to time and again with 

00:04:02.590 --> 00:04:04.269
 today I am more than 

00:04:03.609 --> 00:04:08.519
 satisfied 

00:04:04.269 --> 00:04:08.519
 the point as I said is highly deserved
