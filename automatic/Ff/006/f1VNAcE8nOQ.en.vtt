BAM now there's 96.4 so there's quite a

00:01:08.430 --> 00:01:10.880 
BAM now there's 96.4 so there's quite a
bit<00:01:08.580> different<00:01:08.670> to<00:01:08.970> this<00:01:09.170> now<00:01:10.170> because<00:01:10.770> this

00:01:10.880 --> 00:01:10.890 
bit different to this now because this

00:01:10.890 --> 00:01:13.160 
bit different to this now because this
is<00:01:10.950> like<00:01:11.250> the<00:01:11.430> inside<00:01:11.810> you're<00:01:12.810> going<00:01:12.960> to<00:01:13.020> want

00:01:13.170 --> 00:01:26.179 
is like the inside you're going to want
to<00:01:13.260> go<00:01:13.290> keypad<00:01:14.159> and<00:01:20.119> go<00:01:22.009> 96<00:01:23.009> and<00:01:24.350> this<00:01:25.350> is<00:01:25.650> going

00:01:26.179 --> 00:01:26.189 
to go keypad and go 96 and this is going

00:01:26.189 --> 00:01:31.490 
to go keypad and go 96 and this is going
to<00:01:26.490> be<00:01:26.670> for<00:01:28.159> because<00:01:29.159> it's<00:01:29.400> 96.4<00:01:30.500> pretty

00:01:31.490 --> 00:01:31.500 
to be for because it's 96.4 pretty

00:02:16.990 --> 00:02:17.000 
on the side as well so it doesn't

00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:19.180 
on the side as well so it doesn't

00:02:22.250 --> 00:02:26.050 
that's what yeah so there's just a quick
video<00:02:22.430> on<00:02:23.000> how<00:02:23.950> to<00:02:24.950> just<00:02:25.310> quickly<00:02:25.489> modify<00:02:25.790> it

00:02:26.050 --> 00:02:26.060 
video on how to just quickly modify it

00:02:26.060 --> 00:02:28.319 
video on how to just quickly modify it
so<00:02:26.239> it<00:02:26.329> works<00:02:26.510> on<00:02:26.690> the<00:02:26.780> other<00:02:26.930> side<00:02:27.140> as<00:02:27.290> well

00:02:28.319 --> 00:02:28.329 
so it works on the other side as well

00:02:28.329 --> 00:02:31.930 
so it works on the other side as well
