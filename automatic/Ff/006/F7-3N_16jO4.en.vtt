00:02:37.280 --> 00:02:37.290 
i'm going to build off it with the

00:02:37.290 --> 00:02:42.119 
i'm going to build off it with the
netherrack<00:02:38.290> that's<00:02:38.530> provided<00:02:40.920> someone<00:02:41.920> comes

00:02:42.119 --> 00:02:42.129 
netherrack that's provided someone comes

00:02:42.129 --> 00:02:43.680 
netherrack that's provided someone comes
over<00:02:42.250> here<00:02:42.489> I<00:02:42.640> could<00:02:42.879> be<00:02:43.030> kind<00:02:43.239> of<00:02:43.299> doing<00:02:43.510> but<00:02:43.599> I

00:02:43.680 --> 00:02:43.690 
over here I could be kind of doing but I

00:02:43.690 --> 00:02:46.140 
over here I could be kind of doing but I
do<00:02:43.780> have<00:02:44.019> an<00:02:44.140> ender<00:02:44.379> pearl<00:02:44.560> so<00:02:45.549> that<00:02:45.760> is<00:02:45.879> always

00:02:46.140 --> 00:02:46.150 
do have an ender pearl so that is always

00:02:46.150 --> 00:02:50.280 
do have an ender pearl so that is always
a<00:02:46.329> fail-safe<00:02:48.840> basically<00:02:49.840> whenever<00:02:49.989> you<00:02:50.170> have

00:02:50.280 --> 00:02:50.290 
a fail-safe basically whenever you have

00:02:50.290 --> 00:02:53.130 
a fail-safe basically whenever you have
an<00:02:50.410> end<00:02:50.560> repel<00:02:50.829> if<00:02:51.310> you<00:02:51.489> don't<00:02:51.790> like<00:02:52.720> my<00:02:52.900> advice

00:02:53.130 --> 00:02:53.140 
an end repel if you don't like my advice

00:02:53.140 --> 00:02:54.449 
an end repel if you don't like my advice
is<00:02:53.170> just<00:02:53.379> to<00:02:53.590> go<00:02:53.709> straight<00:02:53.950> for<00:02:54.040> the<00:02:54.099> middle<00:02:54.340> if

00:02:54.449 --> 00:02:54.459 
is just to go straight for the middle if

00:02:54.459 --> 00:02:56.280 
is just to go straight for the middle if
you<00:02:54.549> don't<00:02:54.730> do<00:02:54.790> that<00:02:54.849> kind<00:02:55.420> of<00:02:55.480> like<00:02:55.660> cheating

00:02:56.280 --> 00:02:56.290 
you don't do that kind of like cheating

00:02:56.290 --> 00:02:57.930 
you don't do that kind of like cheating
yourself<00:02:56.590> but<00:02:57.250> yeah<00:02:57.370> some<00:02:57.579> people<00:02:57.609> like<00:02:57.910> to

00:02:57.930 --> 00:02:57.940 
yourself but yeah some people like to

00:02:57.940 --> 00:03:00.629 
yourself but yeah some people like to
take<00:02:58.150> a<00:02:58.180> slope<00:02:58.420> which<00:02:58.569> is<00:02:58.690> fine<00:02:58.900> and<00:02:59.430> that<00:03:00.430> is<00:03:00.609> a

00:03:00.629 --> 00:03:00.639 
take a slope which is fine and that is a

00:03:00.639 --> 00:03:02.099 
take a slope which is fine and that is a
hole<00:03:00.880> right<00:03:00.910> there<00:03:01.120> which<00:03:01.569> I'm<00:03:01.720> not<00:03:01.840> going<00:03:02.049> to

00:03:02.099 --> 00:03:02.109 
hole right there which I'm not going to

00:03:02.109 --> 00:03:04.289 
hole right there which I'm not going to
go<00:03:02.200> in<00:03:02.260> here<00:03:02.400> that<00:03:03.400> is<00:03:03.489> not<00:03:03.609> even<00:03:03.819> flowing<00:03:04.180> off

00:03:04.289 --> 00:03:04.299 
go in here that is not even flowing off

00:03:04.299 --> 00:03:08.120 
go in here that is not even flowing off
the<00:03:04.329> edge<00:03:04.599> so<00:03:04.989> that<00:03:05.200> is<00:03:06.190> a<00:03:06.430> mistake<00:03:06.549> I've<00:03:07.030> made

00:03:08.120 --> 00:03:08.130 
the edge so that is a mistake I've made

00:03:08.130 --> 00:03:12.270 
the edge so that is a mistake I've made
hopefully<00:03:09.130> it<00:03:09.190> is<00:03:09.310> now<00:03:09.459> I<00:03:09.489> think<00:03:09.790> so<00:03:10.560> okay<00:03:11.560> so

00:03:12.270 --> 00:03:12.280 
hopefully it is now I think so okay so

00:03:12.280 --> 00:03:15.720 
hopefully it is now I think so okay so
if<00:03:12.609> I<00:03:12.849> can<00:03:13.919> start<00:03:14.919> building<00:03:15.160> somewhere<00:03:15.549> that

00:03:15.720 --> 00:03:15.730 
if I can start building somewhere that

00:03:15.730 --> 00:03:19.039 
if I can start building somewhere that
would<00:03:15.790> be<00:03:15.940> interesting<00:03:16.510> what<00:03:17.470> if<00:03:17.590> we<00:03:17.620> got

00:03:19.039 --> 00:03:19.049 
would be interesting what if we got

00:03:19.049 --> 00:03:22.319 
would be interesting what if we got
might<00:03:20.049> just<00:03:20.230> go<00:03:20.349> for<00:03:20.530> this<00:03:21.030> track<00:03:22.030> that<00:03:22.209> that

00:03:22.319 --> 00:03:22.329 
might just go for this track that that

00:03:22.329 --> 00:03:24.720 
might just go for this track that that
dude<00:03:22.540> made<00:03:22.780> but<00:03:23.650> it<00:03:23.829> doesn't<00:03:24.160> have<00:03:24.310> a<00:03:24.489> water

00:03:24.720 --> 00:03:24.730 
dude made but it doesn't have a water

00:03:24.730 --> 00:03:25.860 
dude made but it doesn't have a water
source<00:03:24.940> down<00:03:25.180> here<00:03:25.329> so<00:03:25.450> I'm<00:03:25.540> going<00:03:25.690> to<00:03:25.750> have<00:03:25.840> to

00:03:25.860 --> 00:03:25.870 
source down here so I'm going to have to

00:03:25.870 --> 00:03:30.360 
source down here so I'm going to have to
quickly<00:03:26.319> do<00:03:26.739> that<00:03:28.889> there<00:03:29.889> we<00:03:29.950> go<00:03:30.130> that's

00:03:30.360 --> 00:03:30.370 
quickly do that there we go that's

00:03:30.370 --> 00:03:33.330 
quickly do that there we go that's
sorted<00:03:30.730> and<00:03:31.380> now<00:03:32.380> I<00:03:32.410> got<00:03:32.739> to<00:03:32.829> get<00:03:32.889> some<00:03:32.950> wood<00:03:33.190> so

00:03:33.330 --> 00:03:33.340 
sorted and now I got to get some wood so

00:03:33.340 --> 00:03:36.089 
sorted and now I got to get some wood so
I<00:03:33.370> can<00:03:33.549> make<00:03:33.639> a<00:03:33.669> bow<00:03:33.940> and<00:03:34.919> start<00:03:35.919> shooting

00:03:36.089 --> 00:03:36.099 
I can make a bow and start shooting

00:03:36.099 --> 00:03:40.259 
I can make a bow and start shooting
people<00:03:38.010> so<00:03:39.010> yeah<00:03:39.190> I'm<00:03:39.669> not<00:03:39.970> sure<00:03:40.120> how<00:03:40.209> many

00:03:40.259 --> 00:03:40.269 
people so yeah I'm not sure how many

00:03:40.269 --> 00:03:41.370 
people so yeah I'm not sure how many
people<00:03:40.569> left<00:03:40.690> I<00:03:40.810> don't<00:03:40.959> really<00:03:41.109> look<00:03:41.200> at<00:03:41.290> the

00:03:41.370 --> 00:03:41.380 
people left I don't really look at the

00:03:41.380 --> 00:03:46.080 
people left I don't really look at the
chart<00:03:41.590> descent<00:03:41.919> do<00:03:42.519> we<00:03:42.669> have<00:03:42.700> a<00:03:44.910> that's<00:03:45.910> the

00:03:46.080 --> 00:03:46.090 
chart descent do we have a that's the

00:03:46.090 --> 00:03:48.000 
chart descent do we have a that's the
word<00:03:46.239> from<00:03:46.359> that<00:03:46.599> do<00:03:47.230> we<00:03:47.319> have<00:03:47.349> a<00:03:47.620> crafting

00:03:48.000 --> 00:03:48.010 
word from that do we have a crafting

00:03:48.010 --> 00:03:49.170 
word from that do we have a crafting
match<00:03:48.130> I'm<00:03:48.340> not<00:03:48.430> sure<00:03:48.489> i'll<00:03:48.730> just<00:03:48.880> make<00:03:49.030> one

00:03:49.170 --> 00:03:49.180 
match I'm not sure i'll just make one

00:03:49.180 --> 00:03:56.729 
match I'm not sure i'll just make one
anyway<00:03:50.579> probably<00:03:51.579> do<00:03:51.760> and<00:03:52.500> then<00:03:53.500> the<00:03:53.709> bow<00:03:55.739> like

00:03:56.729 --> 00:03:56.739 
anyway probably do and then the bow like

00:03:56.739 --> 00:03:59.110 
anyway probably do and then the bow like

00:04:19.069 --> 00:04:19.079 
guys now going to the middle whom I

00:04:19.079 --> 00:04:27.260 
guys now going to the middle whom I
shall<00:04:19.320> probably<00:04:19.680> try<00:04:20.160> and<00:04:20.220> fly<00:04:20.489> it<00:04:26.270> because

00:04:27.260 --> 00:04:27.270 
shall probably try and fly it because

00:04:34.280 --> 00:04:34.290 
way over that guy's got like full-on

00:04:34.290 --> 00:04:41.090 
way over that guy's got like full-on
gear<00:04:39.200> okay<00:04:40.200> these<00:04:40.380> guys<00:04:40.440> are<00:04:40.740> good<00:04:40.860> at<00:04:40.950> dodging

00:04:41.090 --> 00:04:41.100 
gear okay these guys are good at dodging

00:04:41.100 --> 00:04:43.820 
gear okay these guys are good at dodging
at<00:04:41.370> least<00:04:41.550> so<00:04:42.000> there's<00:04:42.180> that<00:04:42.380> okay<00:04:43.380> now<00:04:43.650> he's
