very<00:00:40.640> good<00:00:40.969> so<00:00:41.210> I'm<00:00:41.300> going<00:00:41.420> to<00:00:41.480> guess<00:00:41.600> that

00:00:41.740 --> 00:00:41.750 
very good so I'm going to guess that

00:00:41.750 --> 00:00:47.349 
very good so I'm going to guess that
they're<00:00:41.929> related<00:00:45.429> and<00:00:46.429> that<00:00:46.579> I<00:00:46.609> check<00:00:46.940> out<00:00:47.059> the

think<00:01:34.820> they<00:01:34.910> should<00:01:35.060> have<00:01:35.090> added<00:01:35.450> a<00:01:35.600> red<00:01:35.900> 1<00:01:36.140> by

00:01:36.250 --> 00:01:36.260 
think they should have added a red 1 by

00:01:36.260 --> 00:01:37.960 
think they should have added a red 1 by
4<00:01:36.530> plate<00:01:36.770> right<00:01:36.950> there<00:01:37.010> just<00:01:37.730> let<00:01:37.850> this

00:01:37.960 --> 00:01:37.970 
4 plate right there just let this

00:01:37.970 --> 00:01:39.820 
4 plate right there just let this
redline<00:01:38.210> can<00:01:38.510> go<00:01:38.630> around<00:01:38.900> the<00:01:38.990> back<00:01:39.140> and<00:01:39.320> cover

00:01:39.820 --> 00:01:39.830 
redline can go around the back and cover

00:01:39.830 --> 00:01:41.680 
redline can go around the back and cover
it<00:01:40.040> it's<00:01:40.160> a<00:01:40.220> little<00:01:40.400> but<00:01:40.640> over<00:01:40.880> here<00:01:41.030> there's<00:01:41.600> a

00:01:41.680 --> 00:01:41.690 
it it's a little but over here there's a

00:01:41.690 --> 00:01:43.450 
it it's a little but over here there's a
little<00:01:41.900> bit<00:01:41.990> exposed<00:01:42.260> there<00:01:42.530> but<00:01:43.160> you<00:01:43.250> can't

00:01:43.450 --> 00:01:43.460 
little bit exposed there but you can't

00:01:43.460 --> 00:01:45.250 
little bit exposed there but you can't
open<00:01:43.760> this<00:01:43.820> up<00:01:44.000> and<00:01:44.240> that's<00:01:44.810> what<00:01:44.960> looks<00:01:45.140> like

00:01:45.250 --> 00:01:45.260 
open this up and that's what looks like

00:01:45.260 --> 00:01:45.790 
open this up and that's what looks like
on<00:01:45.380> the<00:01:45.440> inside

00:01:45.790 --> 00:01:45.800 
on the inside

00:01:45.800 --> 00:01:47.710 
on the inside
you<00:01:46.610> can<00:01:46.730> use<00:01:46.850> it<00:01:46.970> to<00:01:47.060> store<00:01:47.270> the<00:01:47.390> tools<00:01:47.630> that

00:01:47.710 --> 00:01:47.720 
you can use it to store the tools that

00:01:47.720 --> 00:01:49.300 
you can use it to store the tools that
come<00:01:47.900> with<00:01:47.960> a<00:01:48.080> set<00:01:48.320> and<00:01:48.500> if<00:01:48.860> you<00:01:48.950> want<00:01:49.130> you<00:01:49.190> can

00:01:49.300 --> 00:01:49.310 
come with a set and if you want you can

00:01:49.310 --> 00:01:50.560 
come with a set and if you want you can
definitely<00:01:49.400> fit<00:01:49.700> someone<00:01:49.970> in<00:01:50.060> there<00:01:50.240> but<00:01:50.480> you

00:01:50.560 --> 00:01:50.570 
definitely fit someone in there but you

00:01:50.570 --> 00:01:51.910 
definitely fit someone in there but you
cannot<00:01:50.810> sit<00:01:51.020> up<00:01:51.110> straight<00:01:51.470> you'll<00:01:51.650> just<00:01:51.770> have

00:01:51.910 --> 00:01:51.920 
cannot sit up straight you'll just have

00:01:51.920 --> 00:01:53.730 
cannot sit up straight you'll just have
to<00:01:52.040> attach<00:01:52.130> them<00:01:52.490> in<00:01:52.610> there<00:01:52.730> like<00:01:52.880> this<00:01:53.150> and

00:01:53.730 --> 00:01:53.740 
to attach them in there like this and

00:01:53.740 --> 00:01:55.990 
to attach them in there like this and
just<00:01:54.740> start<00:01:54.920> the<00:01:55.010> ceiling<00:01:55.340> not<00:01:55.790> very

00:01:55.990 --> 00:01:56.000 
just start the ceiling not very

00:01:56.000 --> 00:01:57.430 
just start the ceiling not very
comfortable<00:01:56.360> but<00:01:56.660> that's<00:01:56.990> something<00:01:57.260> you<00:01:57.290> can

00:01:57.430 --> 00:01:57.440 
comfortable but that's something you can

00:01:57.440 --> 00:02:00.160 
comfortable but that's something you can
do<00:01:57.640> here's<00:01:58.640> the<00:01:58.760> other<00:01:58.820> side<00:01:59.060> you<00:01:59.810> see<00:01:59.990> it

00:02:00.170 --> 00:02:01.360 
do here's the other side you see it
looks<00:02:00.320> like<00:02:00.440> it's<00:02:00.590> asking<00:02:00.890> for<00:02:00.950> help<00:02:01.160> there

00:02:01.360 --> 00:02:01.370 
looks like it's asking for help there

00:02:01.370 --> 00:02:03.310

pretty much a repair shop on wheels
which<00:02:17.240> is<00:02:17.270> not<00:02:17.540> a<00:02:17.570> bad<00:02:17.840> idea<00:02:17.870> when<00:02:18.260> you<00:02:18.320> think

00:02:18.490 --> 00:02:18.500 
which is not a bad idea when you think

00:02:18.500 --> 00:02:19.720 
which is not a bad idea when you think
about<00:02:18.560> it<00:02:18.800> all<00:02:18.920> you<00:02:19.040> need<00:02:19.130> is<00:02:19.220> an<00:02:19.310> empty<00:02:19.400> lot

and you do some business and you have a
pretty<00:02:22.070> low<00:02:22.190> overhead<00:02:22.550> cost<00:02:22.820> too<00:02:23.000> anyway

00:02:23.440 --> 00:02:23.450 
pretty low overhead cost too anyway

00:02:23.450 --> 00:02:25.600 
pretty low overhead cost too anyway
here's<00:02:23.840> a<00:02:23.960> view<00:02:24.080> of<00:02:24.170> the<00:02:24.260> side<00:02:24.500> and<00:02:24.740> despite

you hold all of them except for the oil

00:02:39.320 --> 00:02:40.450 
you hold all of them except for the oil
you<00:02:39.590> just<00:02:39.620> have<00:02:39.830> to<00:02:39.920> throw<00:02:40.100> that<00:02:40.160> into<00:02:40.370> the

00:02:40.450 --> 00:02:40.460 
you just have to throw that into the

00:02:40.460 --> 00:02:42.670 
you just have to throw that into the
back<00:02:40.640> of<00:02:40.790> the<00:02:40.850> truck<00:02:41.060> and<00:02:41.720> we<00:02:41.960> have<00:02:42.080> two<00:02:42.260> dirt

00:02:42.670 --> 00:02:42.680 
back of the truck and we have two dirt

00:02:42.680 --> 00:02:43.990 
back of the truck and we have two dirt
bikes<00:02:42.920> which<00:02:43.340> by<00:02:43.520> the<00:02:43.670> way<00:02:43.760> they're<00:02:43.880> actually

00:02:43.990 --> 00:02:44.000 
bikes which by the way they're actually

00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:45.760 
bikes which by the way they're actually
kind<00:02:44.420> of<00:02:44.480> rare<00:02:44.690> I<00:02:44.960> think<00:02:45.200> this<00:02:45.320> is<00:02:45.410> the<00:02:45.470> first

00:02:45.760 --> 00:02:45.770 
kind of rare I think this is the first

00:02:45.770 --> 00:02:48.040 
kind of rare I think this is the first
time<00:02:45.980> we've<00:02:46.220> seen<00:02:46.430> them<00:02:46.580> in<00:02:46.700> lime<00:02:47.000> the<00:02:47.750> orange

00:02:48.040 --> 00:02:48.050 
time we've seen them in lime the orange

00:02:48.050 --> 00:02:49.660 
time we've seen them in lime the orange
one<00:02:48.260> I<00:02:48.650> think<00:02:48.860> the<00:02:48.920> last<00:02:49.040> time<00:02:49.220> we<00:02:49.310> saw<00:02:49.460> it<00:02:49.490> was

00:02:49.660 --> 00:02:49.670 
one I think the last time we saw it was

00:02:49.670 --> 00:02:51.280 
one I think the last time we saw it was
in<00:02:49.700> the<00:02:49.880> Coast<00:02:50.120> Guard<00:02:50.360> series<00:02:50.720> which<00:02:50.900> was<00:02:51.080> like

00:02:51.280 --> 00:02:51.290 
in the Coast Guard series which was like

00:02:51.290 --> 00:02:53.199 
in the Coast Guard series which was like
2008<00:02:51.890> and<00:02:52.070> they're<00:02:52.610> all<00:02:52.700> attached<00:02:53.000> in<00:02:53.090> the

00:02:53.199 --> 00:02:53.209 
2008 and they're all attached in the

00:02:53.209 --> 00:02:55.000 
2008 and they're all attached in the
middle<00:02:53.450> there<00:02:53.630> which<00:02:54.290> is<00:02:54.530> actually<00:02:54.920> pretty

00:02:55.000 --> 00:02:55.010 
middle there which is actually pretty

00:02:55.010 --> 00:02:56.500 
middle there which is actually pretty
brilliant<00:02:55.280> even<00:02:55.640> though<00:02:55.760> it's<00:02:55.880> very<00:02:55.910> simple

00:02:56.500 --> 00:02:56.510 
brilliant even though it's very simple

00:02:56.510 --> 00:02:58.720 
brilliant even though it's very simple
and<00:02:56.600> here's<00:02:57.410> the<00:02:57.620> view<00:02:57.770> of<00:02:57.950> the<00:02:58.100> back<00:02:58.280> I<00:02:58.520> like

00:02:58.720 --> 00:02:58.730 
and here's the view of the back I like

00:02:58.730 --> 00:02:59.650 
and here's the view of the back I like
how<00:02:58.820> they<00:02:58.940> have<00:02:58.970> the<00:02:59.180> tail<00:02:59.360> lights<00:02:59.540> right

00:02:59.650 --> 00:02:59.660 
how they have the tail lights right

00:02:59.660 --> 00:03:01.240 
how they have the tail lights right
there<00:02:59.690> I<00:03:00.050> thought<00:03:00.440> that<00:03:00.500> was<00:03:00.740> a<00:03:00.860> pretty<00:03:01.040> nice

00:03:01.240 --> 00:03:01.250 
there I thought that was a pretty nice

00:03:01.250 --> 00:03:03.040 
there I thought that was a pretty nice
idea<00:03:01.580> to<00:03:01.690> here's<00:03:02.690> the<00:03:02.780> view<00:03:02.900> of<00:03:02.959> the<00:03:03.020> other

00:03:03.040 --> 00:03:03.050 
idea to here's the view of the other

00:03:03.050 --> 00:03:05.770 
idea to here's the view of the other
side<00:03:03.200> now<00:03:04.160> up<00:03:04.340> here<00:03:04.700> you'll<00:03:05.270> notice<00:03:05.450> that<00:03:05.570> we

00:03:05.770 --> 00:03:05.780 
side now up here you'll notice that we

00:03:05.780 --> 00:03:08.199 
side now up here you'll notice that we
have<00:03:06.200> two<00:03:06.530> flags<00:03:06.860> which<00:03:07.280> you<00:03:07.430> can<00:03:07.550> use<00:03:07.850> as<00:03:08.180> a

00:03:08.199 --> 00:03:08.209 
have two flags which you can use as a

00:03:08.209 --> 00:03:10.300 
have two flags which you can use as a
start<00:03:08.840> and<00:03:09.020> finish<00:03:09.170> line<00:03:09.320> or<00:03:09.860> maybe<00:03:10.190> you<00:03:10.250> just

00:03:10.300 --> 00:03:10.310 
start and finish line or maybe you just

00:03:10.310 --> 00:03:12.190 
start and finish line or maybe you just
want<00:03:10.490> to<00:03:10.520> do<00:03:10.610> some<00:03:10.790> laps<00:03:10.970> but<00:03:11.630> these<00:03:11.900> two<00:03:12.080> of

00:03:12.190 --> 00:03:12.200 
want to do some laps but these two of

00:03:12.200 --> 00:03:13.600 
want to do some laps but these two of
all<00:03:12.320> Nets<00:03:12.590> so<00:03:12.740> pretty<00:03:12.950> much<00:03:13.040> play<00:03:13.280> abilities

00:03:13.600 --> 00:03:13.610 
all Nets so pretty much play abilities

00:03:13.610 --> 00:03:17.770 
all Nets so pretty much play abilities
to<00:03:13.790> the<00:03:13.970> set<00:03:14.150> and<00:03:15.070> that<00:03:16.120> just<00:03:17.120> about<00:03:17.240> covers<00:03:17.570> it

00:03:17.770 --> 00:03:17.780 
to the set and that just about covers it

00:03:17.780 --> 00:03:20.110 
to the set and that just about covers it
okay<00:03:18.410> and<00:03:18.500> this<00:03:18.590> attaches<00:03:19.160> to<00:03:19.550> the<00:03:19.850> trailer

00:03:20.110 --> 00:03:20.120 
okay and this attaches to the trailer

00:03:20.120 --> 00:03:23.440 
okay and this attaches to the trailer
right<00:03:20.360> here<00:03:20.570> in<00:03:20.630> the<00:03:20.720> back<00:03:20.900> there<00:03:21.110> and<00:03:22.450> it

00:03:23.440 --> 00:03:23.450 
right here in the back there and it

00:03:23.450 --> 00:03:25.150 
right here in the back there and it
works<00:03:23.600> pretty<00:03:23.750> well<00:03:23.870> and<00:03:24.230> now<00:03:24.650> we<00:03:24.709> can<00:03:24.920> move<00:03:25.010> on

00:03:25.150 --> 00:03:25.160 
works pretty well and now we can move on

00:03:25.160 --> 00:03:28.990 
works pretty well and now we can move on
to<00:03:25.310> the<00:03:25.489> recommendations<00:03:27.790> overall<00:03:28.790> this<00:03:28.940> is

00:03:28.990 --> 00:03:29.000 
to the recommendations overall this is

00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:31.270 
to the recommendations overall this is
an<00:03:29.209> extremely<00:03:29.630> good<00:03:29.900> set<00:03:30.200> is<00:03:30.410> actually<00:03:30.950> one<00:03:31.250> of

00:03:31.270 --> 00:03:31.280 
an extremely good set is actually one of

00:03:31.280 --> 00:03:32.920 
an extremely good set is actually one of
the<00:03:31.370> best<00:03:31.580> sets<00:03:32.120> that<00:03:32.239> they<00:03:32.360> have<00:03:32.510> this<00:03:32.630> year

00:03:32.920 --> 00:03:32.930 
the best sets that they have this year

00:03:32.930 --> 00:03:34.660 
the best sets that they have this year
and<00:03:33.080> in<00:03:33.590> general<00:03:33.950> it's<00:03:34.100> actually<00:03:34.430> one<00:03:34.550> of<00:03:34.580> the

00:03:34.660 --> 00:03:34.670 
and in general it's actually one of the

00:03:34.670 --> 00:03:37.060 
and in general it's actually one of the
best<00:03:34.820> $20<00:03:35.420> says<00:03:35.630> to<00:03:35.900> because<00:03:36.680> this<00:03:36.890> just

00:03:37.060 --> 00:03:37.070 
best $20 says to because this just

00:03:37.070 --> 00:03:38.530 
best $20 says to because this just
simply<00:03:37.370> a<00:03:37.400> lot<00:03:37.550> to<00:03:37.640> do<00:03:37.760> here<00:03:37.790> start<00:03:38.420> with<00:03:38.450> the

simply a lot to do here start with the

00:03:38.540 --> 00:03:40.120 
simply a lot to do here start with the
value<00:03:38.750> we<00:03:39.019> have<00:03:39.050> a<00:03:39.170> price<00:03:39.380> per<00:03:39.560> piece<00:03:39.709> ratio<00:03:40.070> of

00:03:40.120 --> 00:03:40.130 
value we have a price per piece ratio of

00:03:40.130 --> 00:03:41.650 
value we have a price per piece ratio of
ten<00:03:40.310> cents<00:03:40.519> per<00:03:40.670> piece<00:03:40.820> which<00:03:41.120> is<00:03:41.150> what<00:03:41.300> I<00:03:41.450> like

00:03:41.650 --> 00:03:41.660 
ten cents per piece which is what I like
