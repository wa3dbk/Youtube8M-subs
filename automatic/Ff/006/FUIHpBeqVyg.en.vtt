this<00:02:13.370> for<00:02:13.490> the<00:02:13.580> iPhone<00:02:13.940> just<00:02:13.970> because<00:02:14.420> the

00:02:15.190 --> 00:02:15.200 
this for the iPhone just because the

00:02:15.200 --> 00:02:17.080 
this for the iPhone just because the
buttons<00:02:15.530> feel<00:02:15.710> small<00:02:16.070> on<00:02:16.310> the<00:02:16.430> iPad<00:02:16.850> so<00:02:16.880> I

believe<00:03:37.580> this<00:03:37.730> actually<00:03:38.120> wants<00:03:38.360> a<00:03:38.420> little

00:03:38.590 --> 00:03:38.600 
believe this actually wants a little

believe this actually wants a little
smoother<00:03:39.020> the<00:03:39.170> grassman's<00:03:39.590> might<00:03:39.710> be<00:03:39.800> a

00:03:39.850 --> 00:03:39.860 
smoother the grassman's might be a

00:03:39.860 --> 00:03:42.220 
smoother the grassman's might be a
little<00:03:40.040> more<00:03:40.190> outdated<00:03:40.850> but<00:03:41.420> the<00:03:41.540> game<00:03:41.690> is<00:03:41.900> fun

00:03:42.220 --> 00:03:42.230 
little more outdated but the game is fun
