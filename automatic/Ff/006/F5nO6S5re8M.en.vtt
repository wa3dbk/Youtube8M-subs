digestive system and what it is is

00:01:14.980 --> 00:01:16.560 
digestive system and what it is is
there's<00:01:15.220> a<00:01:15.280> mutated<00:01:15.790> gene<00:01:16.090> in<00:01:16.270> your<00:01:16.390> body

00:01:16.560 --> 00:01:16.570 
there's a mutated gene in your body

00:01:16.570 --> 00:01:19.770 
there's a mutated gene in your body
you're<00:01:17.170> born<00:01:17.380> with<00:01:17.500> it<00:01:17.620> and<00:01:17.980> it<00:01:18.640> it<00:01:19.390> thinks

00:01:19.770 --> 00:01:19.780 
you're born with it and it it thinks

00:01:19.780 --> 00:01:21.390 
you're born with it and it it thinks
that<00:01:19.900> there's<00:01:20.110> no<00:01:20.230> mucus<00:01:20.620> in<00:01:20.770> your<00:01:20.890> body<00:01:21.040> so<00:01:21.310> it

00:01:21.390 --> 00:01:21.400 
that there's no mucus in your body so it

00:01:21.400 --> 00:01:23.430 
that there's no mucus in your body so it
over<00:01:21.640> produces<00:01:22.150> it<00:01:22.330> and<00:01:22.960> it<00:01:23.050> gets<00:01:23.170> caught<00:01:23.410> up

00:01:23.430 --> 00:01:23.440 
over produces it and it gets caught up

00:01:23.440 --> 00:01:25.410 
over produces it and it gets caught up
in<00:01:23.740> the<00:01:23.860> lungs<00:01:24.100> and<00:01:24.490> in<00:01:24.670> the<00:01:24.790> digestive<00:01:25.360> system

00:01:25.410 --> 00:01:25.420 
in the lungs and in the digestive system

00:01:25.420 --> 00:01:28.620 
in the lungs and in the digestive system
and<00:01:26.340> when<00:01:27.340> it's<00:01:27.460> in<00:01:27.610> the<00:01:27.700> logs<00:01:27.970> it<00:01:28.270> becomes

00:01:28.620 --> 00:01:28.630 
and when it's in the logs it becomes

00:01:28.630 --> 00:01:30.930 
and when it's in the logs it becomes
like<00:01:28.870> a<00:01:29.110> bank<00:01:29.800> like<00:01:30.040> a<00:01:30.100> grow<00:01:30.490> site<00:01:30.520> for

00:01:30.930 --> 00:01:30.940
