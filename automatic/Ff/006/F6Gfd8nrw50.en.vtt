the<00:00:15.120> game<00:00:15.360> runs<00:00:15.900> alright<00:00:16.619> there<00:00:17.190> is<00:00:17.340> a<00:00:17.369> few

00:00:17.840 --> 00:00:17.850 
the game runs alright there is a few

00:00:17.850 --> 00:00:21.050 
the game runs alright there is a few
frame<00:00:18.180> skips<00:00:18.600> and<00:00:18.990> it's<00:00:19.830> not<00:00:20.100> super<00:00:20.490> smooth

00:00:21.050 --> 00:00:21.060 
frame skips and it's not super smooth

00:00:21.060 --> 00:00:24.380 
frame skips and it's not super smooth
but<00:00:21.480> let's<00:00:21.960> say<00:00:22.170> it's<00:00:22.350> just<00:00:22.439> playable<00:00:23.100> so<00:00:23.970> I'm

00:00:24.380 --> 00:00:24.390 
but let's say it's just playable so I'm

00:00:24.390 --> 00:00:26.060 
but let's say it's just playable so I'm
gonna<00:00:24.570> fiddle<00:00:24.990> a<00:00:25.080> little<00:00:25.140> bit<00:00:25.470> with<00:00:25.619> options

00:00:26.060 --> 00:00:26.070 
gonna fiddle a little bit with options

00:00:26.070 --> 00:00:27.920 
gonna fiddle a little bit with options
and<00:00:26.279> show<00:00:26.460> you<00:00:26.519> how<00:00:27.180> they<00:00:27.420> change<00:00:27.720> the

00:00:27.920 --> 00:00:27.930 
and show you how they change the

00:00:27.930 --> 00:00:31.490 
and show you how they change the
gameplay<00:00:28.109> so<00:00:28.710> next<00:00:29.550> I<00:00:29.880> decrease<00:00:30.869> the<00:00:31.170> visual

00:00:31.490 --> 00:00:31.500 
gameplay so next I decrease the visual

00:00:31.500 --> 00:00:34.970 
gameplay so next I decrease the visual
effects<00:00:31.980> to<00:00:32.130> medium<00:00:32.610> and<00:00:33.469> left<00:00:34.469> the<00:00:34.770> dynamic

00:00:34.970 --> 00:00:34.980 
effects to medium and left the dynamic

00:00:34.980 --> 00:00:37.459 
effects to medium and left the dynamic
shadows<00:00:35.370> off<00:00:35.730> and<00:00:36.059> as<00:00:36.630> you<00:00:36.780> can<00:00:36.930> see<00:00:37.200> the

00:00:37.459 --> 00:00:37.469 
shadows off and as you can see the

00:00:37.469 --> 00:00:40.250 
shadows off and as you can see the
gameplay<00:00:37.680> is<00:00:38.219> still<00:00:38.700> ok<00:00:39.329> it<00:00:39.540> got<00:00:39.780> a<00:00:39.809> little<00:00:40.020> bit

00:00:40.250 --> 00:00:40.260 
gameplay is still ok it got a little bit

00:00:40.260 --> 00:00:43.490 
gameplay is still ok it got a little bit
better<00:00:40.500> there<00:00:40.890> is<00:00:40.920> less<00:00:41.309> rainscapes<00:00:42.210> and<00:00:42.540> it's

00:00:43.490 --> 00:00:43.500 
better there is less rainscapes and it's

00:00:43.500 --> 00:00:45.590 
better there is less rainscapes and it's
a<00:00:43.559> little<00:00:43.800> bit<00:00:43.920> smoother<00:00:44.399> so<00:00:45.059> I<00:00:45.329> would

00:00:45.590 --> 00:00:45.600 
a little bit smoother so I would

00:00:45.600 --> 00:00:47.330 
a little bit smoother so I would
definitely<00:00:46.079> recommend<00:00:46.200> using<00:00:46.680> this<00:00:47.010> mode

00:00:47.330 --> 00:00:47.340 
definitely recommend using this mode

00:00:47.340 --> 00:00:52.700 
definitely recommend using this mode
instead<00:00:47.730> of<00:00:47.879> the<00:00:48.059> other<00:00:48.210> one<00:00:50.660> next<00:00:51.660> I<00:00:51.989> said<00:00:52.469> I

00:00:52.700 --> 00:00:52.710 
instead of the other one next I said I

00:00:52.710 --> 00:00:55.189 
instead of the other one next I said I
tried<00:00:53.129> to<00:00:53.340> turn<00:00:53.610> the<00:00:53.640> dynamic<00:00:54.329> shadows<00:00:54.480> on<00:00:54.870> and

00:00:55.189 --> 00:00:55.199 
tried to turn the dynamic shadows on and

00:00:55.199 --> 00:00:59.389 
tried to turn the dynamic shadows on and
left<00:00:55.770> the<00:00:56.039> visual<00:00:56.370> effects<00:00:56.730> on<00:00:56.850> medium<00:00:58.399> this

00:00:59.389 --> 00:00:59.399 
left the visual effects on medium this

00:00:59.399 --> 00:01:02.450 
left the visual effects on medium this
time<00:00:59.760> the<00:01:00.660> game<00:01:00.930> started<00:01:01.559> lagging<00:01:01.859> again<00:01:02.340> the

00:01:02.450 --> 00:01:02.460 
time the game started lagging again the

00:01:02.460 --> 00:01:05.119 
time the game started lagging again the
dynamic<00:01:03.030> shadows<00:01:03.239> do<00:01:03.960> need<00:01:04.170> a<00:01:04.199> lot<00:01:04.470> of<00:01:04.500> GPU

00:01:05.119 --> 00:01:05.129 
dynamic shadows do need a lot of GPU

00:01:05.129 --> 00:01:07.940 
dynamic shadows do need a lot of GPU
power<00:01:05.369> so<00:01:05.820> the<00:01:06.360> Moto<00:01:06.630> G<00:01:06.930> does<00:01:07.140> not<00:01:07.170> handle<00:01:07.799> them

00:01:07.940 --> 00:01:07.950 
power so the Moto G does not handle them

00:01:07.950 --> 00:01:09.800 
power so the Moto G does not handle them
well<00:01:08.130> with<00:01:08.490> visual<00:01:08.880> effects<00:01:09.180> set<00:01:09.450> to<00:01:09.630> medium

00:01:09.800 --> 00:01:09.810 
well with visual effects set to medium

00:01:09.810 --> 00:01:12.500 
well with visual effects set to medium
so<00:01:10.740> as<00:01:10.979> you<00:01:11.100> can<00:01:11.250> see<00:01:11.460> the<00:01:11.610> gameplay<00:01:11.820> is<00:01:12.150> not<00:01:12.360> as

00:01:12.500 --> 00:01:12.510 
so as you can see the gameplay is not as

00:01:12.510 --> 00:01:15.590 
so as you can see the gameplay is not as
smooth<00:01:12.869> as<00:01:13.110> before<00:01:13.979> and<00:01:14.250> the<00:01:14.640> game<00:01:14.670> shows<00:01:15.270> more

00:01:15.590 --> 00:01:15.600 
smooth as before and the game shows more

00:01:15.600 --> 00:01:19.010 
smooth as before and the game shows more
lacks<00:01:15.869> and<00:01:16.320> a<00:01:16.979> lot<00:01:17.250> of<00:01:17.280> frame<00:01:17.640> escapes<00:01:18.000> so<00:01:18.810> then

00:01:19.010 --> 00:01:19.020 
lacks and a lot of frame escapes so then

00:01:19.020 --> 00:01:21.109 
lacks and a lot of frame escapes so then
I<00:01:19.200> decreased<00:01:19.680> the<00:01:19.950> visual<00:01:20.310> effects<00:01:20.759> too<00:01:20.909> low

00:01:21.109 --> 00:01:21.119 
I decreased the visual effects too low

00:01:21.119 --> 00:01:24.950 
I decreased the visual effects too low
and<00:01:21.420> left<00:01:21.869> the<00:01:22.049> dynamic<00:01:22.530> shadows<00:01:22.710> on<00:01:23.130> and<00:01:23.960> that

00:01:24.950 --> 00:01:24.960 
and left the dynamic shadows on and that

00:01:24.960 --> 00:01:28.219 
and left the dynamic shadows on and that
made<00:01:25.500> the<00:01:25.740> game<00:01:25.920> playable<00:01:26.369> again<00:01:26.790> so<00:01:27.150> if<00:01:27.960> you

00:01:28.219 --> 00:01:28.229 
made the game playable again so if you

00:01:28.229 --> 00:01:29.899 
made the game playable again so if you
want<00:01:28.439> to<00:01:28.500> use<00:01:28.619> dynamic<00:01:28.860> shadows<00:01:29.430> you'll<00:01:29.700> have

00:01:29.899 --> 00:01:29.909 
want to use dynamic shadows you'll have

00:01:29.909 --> 00:01:31.429 
want to use dynamic shadows you'll have
to<00:01:30.060> set<00:01:30.240> the<00:01:30.390> visual<00:01:30.720> effects<00:01:31.079> too<00:01:31.259> low

00:01:31.429 --> 00:01:31.439 
to set the visual effects too low

00:01:31.439 --> 00:01:33.679 
to set the visual effects too low
overall<00:01:32.100> it's<00:01:32.369> not<00:01:32.460> my<00:01:32.759> favorite<00:01:33.270> game<00:01:33.450> it

00:01:33.679 --> 00:01:33.689 
overall it's not my favorite game it

00:01:33.689 --> 00:01:36.410 
overall it's not my favorite game it
doesn't<00:01:34.439> run<00:01:34.560> perfectly<00:01:35.250> on<00:01:35.369> Moto<00:01:35.610> G<00:01:35.909> but<00:01:36.270> it

00:01:36.410 --> 00:01:36.420 
doesn't run perfectly on Moto G but it

00:01:36.420 --> 00:01:38.359 
doesn't run perfectly on Moto G but it
runs<00:01:36.630> good<00:01:37.110> enough<00:01:37.380> to<00:01:37.650> be<00:01:37.770> playable<00:01:38.130> if

00:01:38.359 --> 00:01:38.369 
runs good enough to be playable if

00:01:38.369 --> 00:01:39.950 
runs good enough to be playable if
