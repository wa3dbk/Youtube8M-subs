I<00:02:03.780> didn't<00:02:03.990> actually<00:02:04.049> have<00:02:04.290> this<00:02:04.439> enabled<00:02:04.829> but

00:02:04.940 --> 00:02:04.950 
I didn't actually have this enabled but

00:02:04.950 --> 00:02:07.340 
I didn't actually have this enabled but
I<00:02:05.009> do<00:02:05.159> I<00:02:05.520> did<00:02:05.759> just<00:02:05.790> enable<00:02:06.270> it<00:02:06.360> and<00:02:06.390> I<00:02:07.020> do

00:02:07.340 --> 00:02:07.350 
I do I did just enable it and I do

00:02:07.350 --> 00:02:09.380 
I do I did just enable it and I do
normally<00:02:07.799> have<00:02:07.979> this<00:02:08.160> running<00:02:08.369> but<00:02:09.000> if<00:02:09.239> you're

00:02:09.380 --> 00:02:09.390 
normally have this running but if you're

00:02:09.390 --> 00:02:11.630 
normally have this running but if you're
just<00:02:09.569> go<00:02:09.660> into<00:02:09.929> springtomize<00:02:10.379> go<00:02:11.009> into<00:02:11.220> icons

00:02:11.630 --> 00:02:11.640 
just go into springtomize go into icons

00:02:11.640 --> 00:02:13.830 
just go into springtomize go into icons
you<00:02:12.510> can<00:02:12.540> see<00:02:12.900> that<00:02:12.930> I<00:02:13.080> have<00:02:13.170> resized

00:02:13.830 --> 00:02:13.840 
you can see that I have resized

00:02:13.840 --> 00:02:16.470 
you can see that I have resized
icons<00:02:14.260> on<00:02:14.440> that's<00:02:14.830> 90%<00:02:15.160> and<00:02:15.700> resize<00:02:16.239> dark

00:02:16.470 --> 00:02:16.480 
icons on that's 90% and resize dark

00:02:16.480 --> 00:02:18.479 
icons on that's 90% and resize dark
items<00:02:16.810> on<00:02:16.989> as<00:02:17.200> well<00:02:17.410> and<00:02:17.620> that's<00:02:17.680> also<00:02:18.129> ninety

00:02:18.479 --> 00:02:18.489 
items on as well and that's also ninety

00:02:18.489 --> 00:02:20.490 
items on as well and that's also ninety
percent<00:02:18.610> and<00:02:19.599> I<00:02:19.690> just<00:02:19.870> think<00:02:20.050> that<00:02:20.110> gives<00:02:20.319> it<00:02:20.440> a

00:02:20.490 --> 00:02:20.500 
percent and I just think that gives it a

00:02:20.500 --> 00:02:22.650 
percent and I just think that gives it a
little<00:02:20.620> kind<00:02:20.980> of<00:02:21.040> a<00:02:21.129> cleaner<00:02:21.489> interface<00:02:21.970> you

00:02:22.650 --> 00:02:22.660 
little kind of a cleaner interface you

00:02:22.660 --> 00:02:24.570 
little kind of a cleaner interface you
can<00:02:22.690> play<00:02:22.900> around<00:02:23.019> with<00:02:23.319> that<00:02:23.470> I<00:02:23.739> belleek<00:02:24.370> it

00:02:24.570 --> 00:02:24.580 
can play around with that I belleek it

00:02:24.580 --> 00:02:26.369 
can play around with that I belleek it
on<00:02:24.760> ninety<00:02:25.540> percent<00:02:25.569> or<00:02:25.930> ninety<00:02:26.200> five<00:02:26.319> percent

00:02:26.369 --> 00:02:26.379 
on ninety percent or ninety five percent

00:02:26.379 --> 00:02:29.670 
on ninety percent or ninety five percent
I<00:02:26.830> don't<00:02:27.010> want<00:02:27.129> them<00:02:27.220> too<00:02:27.370> small<00:02:27.730> but<00:02:28.470> 92-95<00:02:29.470> is

I don't want them too small but 92-95 is

00:02:29.680 --> 00:02:31.800 
I don't want them too small but 92-95 is
a<00:02:29.709> pretty<00:02:30.069> good<00:02:30.310> balance<00:02:30.730> okay<00:02:31.450> so<00:02:31.510> that's<00:02:31.720> the

00:02:31.800 --> 00:02:31.810 
a pretty good balance okay so that's the
