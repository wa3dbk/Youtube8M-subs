00:00:13.459 --> 00:00:13.469 
a mega gamete and these two require home

00:00:13.469 --> 00:00:15.530 
a mega gamete and these two require home
brewing<00:00:13.799> and<00:00:13.980> or<00:00:14.340> gameshark<00:00:14.969> so<00:00:15.210> if<00:00:15.269> you<00:00:15.360> don't

00:00:27.950 --> 00:00:27.960 
I would say so if you can't get one of

00:00:27.960 --> 00:00:30.320 
I would say so if you can't get one of
these<00:00:28.050> custom<00:00:28.349> vehicles<00:00:28.650> just<00:00:28.859> use<00:00:28.980> him<00:00:29.330> yeah

00:00:30.320 --> 00:00:30.330 
these custom vehicles just use him yeah

00:00:30.330 --> 00:00:32.870 
these custom vehicles just use him yeah
so<00:00:30.810> we<00:00:31.740> need<00:00:31.920> some<00:00:32.040> big<00:00:32.099> a<00:00:32.160> condor<00:00:32.550> it's<00:00:32.759> my

order<00:00:40.590> for<00:00:40.710> this<00:00:40.800> trick<00:00:41.010> to<00:00:41.040> work<00:00:41.899> so<00:00:42.899> what

00:00:43.400 --> 00:00:43.410 
order for this trick to work so what

00:00:43.410 --> 00:00:45.680 
order for this trick to work so what
you're<00:00:43.500> gonna<00:00:43.590> do<00:00:43.770> is<00:00:44.010> you're<00:00:44.280> we<00:00:45.149> first<00:00:45.420> start

00:00:45.680 --> 00:00:45.690 
you're gonna do is you're we first start

00:00:45.690 --> 00:00:47.389 
you're gonna do is you're we first start
off<00:00:45.780> you're<00:00:46.020> gonna<00:00:46.110> hold<00:00:46.350> L<00:00:46.559> on<00:00:46.860> the<00:00:47.129> trigger

00:00:47.389 --> 00:00:47.399 
off you're gonna hold L on the trigger

00:00:47.399 --> 00:00:49.910 
off you're gonna hold L on the trigger
like<00:00:47.820> on<00:00:48.030> the<00:00:48.180> L<00:00:48.270> button<00:00:48.510> and<00:00:48.719> left<00:00:49.620> on<00:00:49.800> the

00:00:49.910 --> 00:00:49.920 
like on the L button and left on the

00:00:49.920 --> 00:00:52.610 
like on the L button and left on the
analog<00:00:50.190> stick<00:00:50.600> so<00:00:51.600> he<00:00:51.629> kind<00:00:51.899> of<00:00:51.989> sprays<00:00:52.320> to<00:00:52.500> the

00:00:52.610 --> 00:00:52.620 
analog stick so he kind of sprays to the

00:00:52.620 --> 00:00:57.619 
analog stick so he kind of sprays to the
left<00:00:54.530> instead<00:00:55.530> of<00:00:55.739> that<00:00:56.010> basically<00:00:56.789> and<00:00:56.969> then

00:00:57.619 --> 00:00:57.629 
left instead of that basically and then

00:00:57.629 --> 00:00:58.880 
left instead of that basically and then
you're<00:00:57.719> gonna<00:00:57.809> shift<00:00:58.170> to<00:00:58.350> the<00:00:58.440> right<00:00:58.469> so

00:00:58.880 --> 00:00:58.890 
you're gonna shift to the right so

00:00:58.890 --> 00:01:01.610 
you're gonna shift to the right so
you're<00:00:59.039> gonna<00:00:59.129> let<00:00:59.550> go<00:00:59.760> of<00:00:59.850> L<00:00:59.940> hold<00:01:00.539> R<00:01:00.780> and<00:01:01.079> then

00:01:01.610 --> 00:01:01.620 
you're gonna let go of L hold R and then

00:01:01.620 --> 00:01:03.380 
you're gonna let go of L hold R and then
shift<00:01:01.980> the<00:01:02.039> analog<00:01:02.430> stick<00:01:02.640> to<00:01:02.760> the<00:01:02.850> right<00:01:03.059> and

00:01:03.380 --> 00:01:03.390 
shift the analog stick to the right and

00:01:03.390 --> 00:01:05.240 
shift the analog stick to the right and
this<00:01:04.110> entire<00:01:04.439> time<00:01:04.650> you're<00:01:04.799> gonna<00:01:04.949> be<00:01:05.010> holding

00:01:05.240 --> 00:01:05.250 
this entire time you're gonna be holding

00:01:05.250 --> 00:01:07.330 
this entire time you're gonna be holding
a<00:01:05.369> so<00:01:05.640> it's<00:01:05.760> gonna<00:01:05.850> look<00:01:05.939> something<00:01:06.150> like<00:01:06.299> that

00:01:07.330 --> 00:01:07.340 
a so it's gonna look something like that

00:01:07.340 --> 00:01:09.560 
a so it's gonna look something like that
it<00:01:08.340> takes<00:01:08.460> a<00:01:08.549> little<00:01:08.670> while<00:01:08.820> to<00:01:09.000> get<00:01:09.090> fast<00:01:09.360> at

00:01:09.560 --> 00:01:09.570 
it takes a little while to get fast at

00:01:09.570 --> 00:01:11.690 
it takes a little while to get fast at
it<00:01:09.630> but<00:01:09.750> once<00:01:09.869> you<00:01:10.049> do<00:01:10.200> you<00:01:10.500> can<00:01:11.430> go<00:01:11.549> pretty

00:01:11.690 --> 00:01:11.700 
it but once you do you can go pretty

00:01:11.700 --> 00:01:15.760 
it but once you do you can go pretty
fast<00:01:12.000> it's<00:01:12.210> making

00:01:15.760 --> 00:01:15.770 

00:01:15.770 --> 00:01:17.860 

looks<00:01:16.310> kind<00:01:16.490> of<00:01:16.520> like<00:01:16.580> that<00:01:16.790> and<00:01:17.720> obviously

00:01:17.860 --> 00:01:17.870 
looks kind of like that and obviously

00:01:17.870 --> 00:01:20.470 
looks kind of like that and obviously
you<00:01:18.530> one-one<00:01:18.800> hit<00:01:18.950> a<00:01:18.980> wall<00:01:19.190> before<00:01:20.000> so<00:01:20.240> we<00:01:20.360> do

00:01:20.470 --> 00:01:20.480 
you one-one hit a wall before so we do

00:01:20.480 --> 00:01:21.970 
you one-one hit a wall before so we do
hit<00:01:20.630> a<00:01:20.660> wall<00:01:20.810> you<00:01:20.930> lose<00:01:21.080> a<00:01:21.110> lot<00:01:21.410> of<00:01:21.440> speed<00:01:21.620> and

00:01:21.970 --> 00:01:21.980 
hit a wall you lose a lot of speed and

00:01:21.980 --> 00:01:24.960 
hit a wall you lose a lot of speed and
then<00:01:22.160> weird<00:01:22.760> like<00:01:22.880> this<00:01:23.030> can<00:01:23.180> happen

00:01:24.960 --> 00:01:24.970 
then weird like this can happen

00:01:24.970 --> 00:01:26.110 
then weird like this can happen
okay

00:01:26.110 --> 00:01:26.120 
okay

00:01:26.120 --> 00:01:29.800 
okay
I<00:01:26.410> don't<00:01:27.410> know<00:01:27.470> what<00:01:27.590> that<00:01:27.710> was<00:01:28.100> yeah<00:01:28.670> so<00:01:29.120> it's

00:01:29.800 --> 00:01:29.810 
I don't know what that was yeah so it's

00:01:29.810 --> 00:01:31.600 
I don't know what that was yeah so it's
a<00:01:29.900> very<00:01:30.110> painful<00:01:30.410> trick<00:01:30.860> and<00:01:31.040> it<00:01:31.100> really<00:01:31.280> kills

00:01:31.600 --> 00:01:31.610 
a very painful trick and it really kills

00:01:31.610 --> 00:01:33.969 
a very painful trick and it really kills
your<00:01:31.760> wrists<00:01:32.030> very<00:01:32.360> very<00:01:32.840> quickly<00:01:33.170> so<00:01:33.680> I'm<00:01:33.860> not

00:01:33.969 --> 00:01:33.979 
your wrists very very quickly so I'm not

00:01:33.979 --> 00:01:36.250 
your wrists very very quickly so I'm not
really<00:01:34.280> recommend<00:01:34.670> sneaking<00:01:35.090> at<00:01:35.150> all<00:01:35.270> but

00:01:36.250 --> 00:01:36.260 
really recommend sneaking at all but

00:01:36.260 --> 00:01:37.420 
really recommend sneaking at all but
it's<00:01:36.410> kind<00:01:36.560> of<00:01:36.590> fun<00:01:36.740> because<00:01:36.920> that<00:01:37.070> you<00:01:37.280> go

00:01:37.420 --> 00:01:37.430 
it's kind of fun because that you go

00:01:37.430 --> 00:01:39.870 
it's kind of fun because that you go
fast<00:01:37.700> but<00:01:38.030> your<00:01:38.420> wrists<00:01:38.630> will<00:01:38.840> die<00:01:38.990> quickly<00:01:39.170> so

00:01:39.870 --> 00:01:39.880 
fast but your wrists will die quickly so

00:01:39.880 --> 00:01:42.580 
fast but your wrists will die quickly so
you<00:01:40.880> just<00:01:41.000> have<00:01:41.180> to<00:01:41.330> get<00:01:41.840> used<00:01:42.140> to<00:01:42.229> the<00:01:42.350> speed

00:01:42.580 --> 00:01:42.590 
you just have to get used to the speed

00:01:42.590 --> 00:01:44.469 
you just have to get used to the speed
like<00:01:43.070> when<00:01:43.550> you<00:01:43.610> first<00:01:43.820> start<00:01:44.119> off<00:01:44.240> you're

00:01:44.469 --> 00:01:44.479 
like when you first start off you're

00:01:44.479 --> 00:01:45.910 
like when you first start off you're
gonna<00:01:44.630> want<00:01:44.780> to<00:01:44.810> start<00:01:45.350> off<00:01:45.530> going<00:01:45.680> very

00:01:45.910 --> 00:01:45.920 
gonna want to start off going very

00:01:45.920 --> 00:01:48.730 
gonna want to start off going very
slowly<00:01:46.190> going<00:01:46.550> like<00:01:46.810> you<00:01:47.810> know<00:01:47.930> making<00:01:48.590> sure

00:01:48.730 --> 00:01:48.740 
slowly going like you know making sure

00:01:48.740 --> 00:01:50.830 
slowly going like you know making sure
you're<00:01:49.040> hitting<00:01:49.310> the<00:01:49.460> right<00:01:49.640> funds<00:01:50.330> at<00:01:50.750> the

00:01:50.830 --> 00:01:50.840 
you're hitting the right funds at the

00:01:50.840 --> 00:01:52.810 
you're hitting the right funds at the
right<00:01:50.990> time<00:01:51.200> but<00:01:52.070> then<00:01:52.220> once<00:01:52.399> you<00:01:52.640> can

00:01:52.810 --> 00:01:52.820 
right time but then once you can

00:01:52.820 --> 00:01:54.550 
right time but then once you can
basically<00:01:53.540> get<00:01:53.840> it<00:01:53.990> down<00:01:54.140> you<00:01:54.229> can<00:01:54.259> go<00:01:54.410> very

00:01:54.550 --> 00:01:54.560 
basically get it down you can go very

00:01:54.560 --> 00:01:58.450 
basically get it down you can go very
fast<00:01:54.680> and<00:01:55.570> you<00:01:56.570> can<00:01:56.720> get<00:01:56.810> up<00:01:56.899> to<00:01:56.930> about<00:01:57.460> 3,000

00:01:58.450 --> 00:01:58.460 
fast and you can get up to about 3,000

00:01:58.460 --> 00:02:00.550 
fast and you can get up to about 3,000
kilometers<00:01:58.820> an<00:01:58.940> hour<00:01:59.030> if<00:01:59.330> you<00:01:59.479> have<00:01:59.570> boots<00:01:59.869> if

00:02:00.550 --> 00:02:00.560 
kilometers an hour if you have boots if

00:02:00.560 --> 00:02:07.030 
kilometers an hour if you have boots if
they<00:02:00.800> don't<00:02:01.070> you<00:02:01.280> can<00:02:01.430> get<00:02:02.000> around<00:02:02.470> 2,500<00:02:06.040> so

00:02:07.030 --> 00:02:07.040 
they don't you can get around 2,500 so

00:02:07.040 --> 00:02:09.370 
they don't you can get around 2,500 so
yeah<00:02:07.250> it's<00:02:07.880> the<00:02:08.000> same<00:02:08.179> technique<00:02:08.600> as<00:02:08.780> space

00:02:09.370 --> 00:02:09.380 
yeah it's the same technique as space

00:02:09.380 --> 00:02:11.470 
yeah it's the same technique as space
flying<00:02:09.709> only<00:02:09.920> when<00:02:10.190> you're<00:02:10.280> on<00:02:10.369> the<00:02:10.459> ground<00:02:10.640> so

00:02:11.470 --> 00:02:11.480 
flying only when you're on the ground so

00:02:11.480 --> 00:02:13.600 
flying only when you're on the ground so
yeah<00:02:12.290> I<00:02:12.530> would<00:02:12.770> just<00:02:12.860> recommend<00:02:13.010> starting<00:02:13.520> off

00:02:13.600 --> 00:02:13.610 
yeah I would just recommend starting off

00:02:13.610 --> 00:02:15.640 
yeah I would just recommend starting off
very<00:02:13.670> slow<00:02:14.120> and<00:02:14.390> then<00:02:14.690> slowly<00:02:15.050> incrementing

00:02:15.640 --> 00:02:15.650 
very slow and then slowly incrementing

00:02:15.650 --> 00:02:18.220 
very slow and then slowly incrementing
your<00:02:15.770> speed<00:02:16.270> like<00:02:17.270> on<00:02:17.420> the<00:02:17.570> button<00:02:17.840> switching

00:02:18.220 --> 00:02:18.230 
your speed like on the button switching

00:02:18.230 --> 00:02:22.390 
your speed like on the button switching
and<00:02:18.830> so<00:02:18.950> I<00:02:18.980> can<00:02:19.100> get<00:02:19.220> very<00:02:19.250> good<00:02:19.459> at<00:02:19.580> it<00:02:19.670> yeah
