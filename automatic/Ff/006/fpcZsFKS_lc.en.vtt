genetic mutation that was causing his

00:01:33.659 --> 00:01:37.039 
genetic mutation that was causing his
immune<00:01:33.990> system<00:01:34.020> to<00:01:34.530> fail<00:01:34.680> knowing<00:01:35.840> what<00:01:36.840> was<00:01:37.020> a

00:01:37.039 --> 00:01:37.049 
immune system to fail knowing what was a

00:01:37.049 --> 00:01:39.530 
immune system to fail knowing what was a
root<00:01:37.380> of<00:01:37.650> a<00:01:37.710> problem<00:01:38.189> having<00:01:38.880> the<00:01:39.119> genetic

roots of the disease we were able to

00:01:41.700 --> 00:01:44.780 
roots of the disease we were able to
number<00:01:42.090> 12<00:01:42.479> to<00:01:43.020> maintain<00:01:43.409> him<00:01:43.649> how<00:01:43.920> I<00:01:43.950> felt<00:01:44.460> a

number 12 to maintain him how I felt a
little<00:01:45.060> relief<00:01:45.509> also<00:01:46.170> that<00:01:46.350> we<00:01:46.500> know<00:01:46.680> what<00:01:46.829> it

00:01:46.969 --> 00:01:46.979 
little relief also that we know what it

00:01:46.979 --> 00:01:50.450 
little relief also that we know what it
was<00:01:47.479> happening<00:01:48.479> the<00:01:49.229> technical<00:01:49.680> name<00:01:49.860> of<00:01:50.250> his

was happening the technical name of his

00:01:50.460 --> 00:01:54.999 
was happening the technical name of his

child it was March 14 2004 when Sophia

00:02:37.110 --> 00:02:42.050 
child it was March 14 2004 when Sophia
was<00:02:37.800> born<00:02:38.100> it<00:02:38.880> was<00:02:39.300> an<00:02:40.050> amazing<00:02:40.290> babe<00:02:41.060> the

00:02:42.050 --> 00:02:42.060 
was born it was an amazing babe the

00:02:42.060 --> 00:02:44.810 
was born it was an amazing babe the
first<00:02:42.360> the<00:02:42.810> moment<00:02:43.140> I<00:02:43.200> heard<00:02:43.410> her<00:02:43.680> cry<00:02:43.980> is<00:02:44.400> the

00:02:44.810 --> 00:02:44.820 
first the moment I heard her cry is the

00:02:44.820 --> 00:02:48.560 
first the moment I heard her cry is the
best<00:02:45.450> day<00:02:45.600> of<00:02:45.630> my<00:02:45.750> life<00:02:46.010> red<00:02:47.010> cheeks<00:02:47.570> beautiful

00:02:48.560 --> 00:02:48.570 
best day of my life red cheeks beautiful

00:02:48.570 --> 00:02:50.900 
best day of my life red cheeks beautiful
then<00:02:48.930> we<00:02:49.080> learned<00:02:49.260> that<00:02:49.650> the<00:02:50.190> umbilical<00:02:50.730> cord

00:02:50.900 --> 00:02:50.910 
then we learned that the umbilical cord

00:02:50.910 --> 00:02:55.220 
then we learned that the umbilical cord
stem<00:02:51.180> cells<00:02:51.510> that<00:02:52.730> we<00:02:53.730> have<00:02:53.910> gathered<00:02:54.390> were

00:02:55.220 --> 00:02:55.230 
stem cells that we have gathered were

00:02:55.230 --> 00:02:59.600 
stem cells that we have gathered were
not<00:02:55.470> enough<00:02:55.770> for<00:02:56.370> andy's<00:02:57.030> transplant<00:02:57.630> so<00:02:58.610> the

00:02:59.600 --> 00:02:59.610 
not enough for andy's transplant so the

00:02:59.610 --> 00:03:01.670 
not enough for andy's transplant so the
decision<00:02:59.970> we<00:03:00.390> took<00:03:00.690> which<00:03:00.959> was<00:03:01.230> also<00:03:01.650> a

00:03:01.670 --> 00:03:01.680 
decision we took which was also a

00:03:01.680 --> 00:03:03.680 
decision we took which was also a
difficult<00:03:02.100> decision<00:03:02.220> was<00:03:02.700> to<00:03:02.880> wait<00:03:03.120> six

00:03:03.680 --> 00:03:03.690 
difficult decision was to wait six

00:03:03.690 --> 00:03:08.000 
difficult decision was to wait six
months<00:03:03.959> until<00:03:04.520> Sophia<00:03:05.520> our<00:03:06.150> daughter<00:03:07.010> was

00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:08.010 
months until Sophia our daughter was

00:03:08.010 --> 00:03:11.090 
months until Sophia our daughter was
stronger<00:03:08.520> hey<00:03:09.390> go<00:03:09.630> get<00:03:09.870> a<00:03:09.930> the<00:03:10.680> bone<00:03:10.830> marrow

00:03:11.090 --> 00:03:11.100 
stronger hey go get a the bone marrow

00:03:11.100 --> 00:03:16.930 
stronger hey go get a the bone marrow
from<00:03:11.370> hair<00:03:11.700> and<00:03:11.940> it<00:03:12.300> was<00:03:12.480> October<00:03:14.810> 2004<00:03:15.830> when

00:03:16.930 --> 00:03:16.940 
from hair and it was October 2004 when

00:03:16.940 --> 00:03:19.430 
from hair and it was October 2004 when
all<00:03:17.940> the<00:03:18.090> family<00:03:18.450> came<00:03:18.630> to<00:03:18.810> the<00:03:18.900> hospital<00:03:19.049> and

00:03:19.430 --> 00:03:19.440 
all the family came to the hospital and

00:03:19.440 --> 00:03:22.880 
all the family came to the hospital and
B<00:03:20.220> we<00:03:20.459> see<00:03:20.700> 10<00:03:21.510> days<00:03:21.720> of<00:03:21.930> chemotherapy<00:03:22.110> and

00:03:22.880 --> 00:03:22.890 
B we see 10 days of chemotherapy and

00:03:22.890 --> 00:03:25.910 
B we see 10 days of chemotherapy and
then<00:03:23.640> here<00:03:23.850> we<00:03:23.880> see<00:03:24.180> both<00:03:24.480> the<00:03:24.840> umbilical<00:03:25.410> cord

00:03:25.910 --> 00:03:25.920 
then here we see both the umbilical cord

00:03:25.920 --> 00:03:28.039 
then here we see both the umbilical cord
stem<00:03:26.370> cells<00:03:26.730> and<00:03:27.060> the<00:03:27.360> bone<00:03:27.540> marrow<00:03:27.720> stem

00:03:28.039 --> 00:03:28.049 
stem cells and the bone marrow stem

00:03:28.049 --> 00:03:30.710 
stem cells and the bone marrow stem
cells<00:03:28.380> from<00:03:28.530> Sophia<00:03:29.130> it<00:03:29.940> was<00:03:30.090> a<00:03:30.120> very<00:03:30.269> special

00:03:30.710 --> 00:03:30.720 
cells from Sophia it was a very special

00:03:30.720 --> 00:03:35.840 
cells from Sophia it was a very special
moment<00:03:31.640> obviously<00:03:32.640> to<00:03:33.500> be<00:03:34.500> able<00:03:34.799> to<00:03:35.010> offer<00:03:35.400> him

00:03:35.840 --> 00:03:35.850 
moment obviously to be able to offer him

00:03:35.850 --> 00:03:38.720 
moment obviously to be able to offer him
this<00:03:36.060> the<00:03:36.570> chance<00:03:36.870> of<00:03:37.040> receiving<00:03:38.040> these<00:03:38.459> new

00:03:38.720 --> 00:03:38.730 
this the chance of receiving these new

00:03:38.730 --> 00:03:41.000 
this the chance of receiving these new
cells<00:03:39.030> that<00:03:39.840> would<00:03:40.019> allow<00:03:40.260> him<00:03:40.290> to<00:03:40.709> live<00:03:40.950> a

00:03:41.000 --> 00:03:41.010 
cells that would allow him to live a

00:03:41.010 --> 00:03:44.650 
cells that would allow him to live a
normal<00:03:41.220> life<00:03:41.610> it<00:03:42.090> took<00:03:42.269> about<00:03:43.280> two<00:03:44.280> years

00:03:44.650 --> 00:03:44.660 
normal life it took about two years

00:03:44.660 --> 00:03:48.110 
normal life it took about two years
total<00:03:45.660> for<00:03:46.590> us<00:03:46.709> to<00:03:46.860> be<00:03:46.980> able<00:03:47.010> to<00:03:47.340> say<00:03:47.519> that<00:03:47.760> that

00:03:48.110 --> 00:03:48.120 
total for us to be able to say that that

00:03:48.120 --> 00:03:52.460 
total for us to be able to say that that
is<00:03:48.440> secured<00:03:49.440> and<00:03:49.620> that<00:03:50.400> he's<00:03:50.959> doing<00:03:51.959> very<00:03:52.080> well

00:03:52.460 --> 00:03:52.470 
is secured and that he's doing very well

00:03:52.470 --> 00:03:57.410 
is secured and that he's doing very well
we've<00:03:53.190> seen<00:03:53.519> it<00:03:53.730> working<00:03:55.190> what<00:03:56.190> cured<00:03:56.940> my<00:03:57.120> son

00:03:57.410 --> 00:03:57.420 
we've seen it working what cured my son

00:03:57.420 --> 00:04:00.500 
we've seen it working what cured my son
was<00:03:57.780> the<00:03:58.640> fact<00:03:59.640> that<00:03:59.820> we<00:04:00.030> were<00:04:00.150> able<00:04:00.330> to

00:04:00.500 --> 00:04:00.510 
was the fact that we were able to

00:04:00.510 --> 00:04:04.160 
was the fact that we were able to
replace<00:04:01.080> defective<00:04:01.920> cells<00:04:02.630> with<00:04:03.630> new<00:04:03.840> cells

00:04:04.160 --> 00:04:04.170 
replace defective cells with new cells

00:04:04.170 --> 00:04:07.729 
replace defective cells with new cells
that<00:04:04.470> didn't<00:04:04.799> have<00:04:04.950> a<00:04:05.130> genetic<00:04:05.340> mutation<00:04:06.739> we

00:04:07.729 --> 00:04:07.739 
that didn't have a genetic mutation we

00:04:07.739 --> 00:04:11.420 
that didn't have a genetic mutation we
believe<00:04:08.370> that<00:04:08.840> stem<00:04:09.840> cell<00:04:10.110> research<00:04:10.560> will<00:04:11.220> be

00:04:11.420 --> 00:04:11.430 
believe that stem cell research will be

00:04:11.430 --> 00:04:14.740 
believe that stem cell research will be
able<00:04:11.670> to<00:04:11.880> do<00:04:12.150> that<00:04:12.390> for<00:04:13.200> diseases<00:04:13.680> that<00:04:14.040> affect

00:04:14.740 --> 00:04:14.750 
able to do that for diseases that affect

00:04:14.750 --> 00:04:18.740 
able to do that for diseases that affect
many<00:04:15.750> people<00:04:16.229> worldwide<00:04:17.390> did<00:04:18.390> in<00:04:18.540> vitro

00:04:18.740 --> 00:04:18.750 
many people worldwide did in vitro

00:04:18.750 --> 00:04:20.659 
many people worldwide did in vitro
fertilization<00:04:19.560> cycles<00:04:20.070> and<00:04:20.250> the<00:04:20.400> window

00:04:20.659 --> 00:04:20.669 
fertilization cycles and the window

00:04:20.669 --> 00:04:25.100 
fertilization cycles and the window
cycles<00:04:21.150> we<00:04:21.299> had<00:04:21.540> to<00:04:21.750> create<00:04:24.020> actually<00:04:25.020> we

00:04:25.100 --> 00:04:25.110 
cycles we had to create actually we

00:04:25.110 --> 00:04:26.990 
cycles we had to create actually we
created<00:04:25.470> 26<00:04:25.919> m

00:04:26.990 --> 00:04:27.000 
created 26 m

00:04:27.000 --> 00:04:31.430 
created 26 m
and<00:04:27.480> from<00:04:28.260> those<00:04:28.470> 26<00:04:29.130> embryos<00:04:30.170> two<00:04:31.170> of<00:04:31.290> them

00:04:31.430 --> 00:04:31.440 
and from those 26 embryos two of them

00:04:31.440 --> 00:04:34.610 
and from those 26 embryos two of them
were<00:04:31.650> compatible<00:04:32.040> we<00:04:32.820> had<00:04:33.170> three<00:04:34.170> options

00:04:34.610 --> 00:04:34.620 
were compatible we had three options

00:04:34.620 --> 00:04:38.240 
were compatible we had three options
with<00:04:35.490> the<00:04:35.700> fertility<00:04:36.270> center<00:04:36.660> one<00:04:37.440> is<00:04:37.650> to<00:04:37.920> just

00:04:38.240 --> 00:04:38.250 
with the fertility center one is to just

00:04:38.250 --> 00:04:41.980 
with the fertility center one is to just
keep<00:04:38.370> those<00:04:38.670> cells<00:04:39.000> frozen<00:04:39.570> and<00:04:40.010> just<00:04:41.010> wait

00:04:41.980 --> 00:04:41.990 
keep those cells frozen and just wait

00:04:41.990 --> 00:04:45.020 
keep those cells frozen and just wait
hopefully<00:04:42.990> medicine<00:04:43.590> who<00:04:43.830> would<00:04:44.250> advance<00:04:44.580> and

00:04:45.020 --> 00:04:45.030 
hopefully medicine who would advance and

00:04:45.030 --> 00:04:48.230 
hopefully medicine who would advance and
that<00:04:45.300> would<00:04:45.720> find<00:04:46.560> a<00:04:46.680> cure<00:04:46.860> for<00:04:46.920> nemo<00:04:47.400> the

00:04:48.230 --> 00:04:48.240 
that would find a cure for nemo the

00:04:48.240 --> 00:04:50.500 
that would find a cure for nemo the
other<00:04:48.390> option<00:04:48.840> was<00:04:48.990> to<00:04:49.050> discarded<00:04:49.800> but<00:04:50.340> we

00:04:50.500 --> 00:04:50.510 
other option was to discarded but we

00:04:50.510 --> 00:04:53.330 
other option was to discarded but we
didn't<00:04:51.510> want<00:04:51.720> to<00:04:51.810> do<00:04:52.260> that<00:04:52.290> and<00:04:52.680> the<00:04:53.310> third

00:04:53.330 --> 00:04:53.340 
didn't want to do that and the third

00:04:53.340 --> 00:04:56.180 
didn't want to do that and the third
option<00:04:53.730> was<00:04:54.120> to<00:04:54.150> donate<00:04:54.690> for<00:04:54.720> research<00:04:55.410> so<00:04:56.160> we

00:04:56.180 --> 00:04:56.190 
option was to donate for research so we

00:04:56.190 --> 00:04:58.760 
option was to donate for research so we
knew<00:04:56.520> about<00:04:56.670> dr.<00:04:57.210> George<00:04:57.480> Daley<00:04:57.810> and<00:04:57.990> his<00:04:58.230> the

00:04:58.760 --> 00:04:58.770 
knew about dr. George Daley and his the

00:04:58.770 --> 00:05:00.290 
knew about dr. George Daley and his the
research<00:04:59.130> being<00:04:59.430> done<00:04:59.580> at<00:04:59.940> Children's

00:05:00.290 --> 00:05:00.300 
research being done at Children's

00:05:00.300 --> 00:05:03.890 
research being done at Children's
Hospital<00:05:00.390> Boston<00:05:00.780> and<00:05:01.880> so<00:05:02.880> being<00:05:03.270> witness<00:05:03.720> of

00:05:03.890 --> 00:05:03.900 
Hospital Boston and so being witness of

00:05:03.900 --> 00:05:07.250 
Hospital Boston and so being witness of
how<00:05:04.560> my<00:05:04.740> son<00:05:04.800> our<00:05:05.310> son<00:05:05.610> was<00:05:05.820> cured<00:05:06.270> we<00:05:07.050> know

00:05:07.250 --> 00:05:07.260 
how my son our son was cured we know

how my son our son was cured we know
with<00:05:07.560> this<00:05:07.710> that<00:05:08.430> with<00:05:08.610> this<00:05:08.820> type<00:05:09.210> of

00:05:09.250 --> 00:05:09.260 
with this that with this type of

00:05:09.260 --> 00:05:13.670 
with this that with this type of
research<00:05:10.460> many<00:05:11.460> will<00:05:11.760> benefit<00:05:12.240> so<00:05:12.990> we<00:05:13.140> donated

00:05:13.670 --> 00:05:13.680 
research many will benefit so we donated

00:05:13.680 --> 00:05:17.650 
research many will benefit so we donated
those<00:05:13.830> embryos<00:05:14.190> it<00:05:14.640> was<00:05:15.020> October<00:05:16.020> last<00:05:16.580> year

00:05:17.650 --> 00:05:17.660 
those embryos it was October last year

00:05:17.660 --> 00:05:21.260 
those embryos it was October last year
when<00:05:18.660> we<00:05:18.690> learn<00:05:19.080> that<00:05:19.680> to<00:05:20.130> embryonic<00:05:20.790> stem

00:05:21.260 --> 00:05:21.270

they want to try out a new medication

00:05:38.220 --> 00:05:41.270 
they want to try out a new medication
they<00:05:39.090> take<00:05:39.390> a<00:05:39.419> sample<00:05:39.990> of<00:05:40.110> the<00:05:40.169> cells<00:05:40.530> try<00:05:41.220> the

medication on the cells and see what

00:05:43.919 --> 00:05:46.580 
medication on the cells and see what
effects<00:05:44.370> or<00:05:44.660> benefits<00:05:45.660> it<00:05:45.840> could<00:05:46.080> bring<00:05:46.290> to<00:05:46.560> a

effects or benefits it could bring to a
patient<00:05:47.130> we<00:05:47.490> think<00:05:47.760> this<00:05:48.360> is<00:05:48.510> only<00:05:48.690> the

00:05:48.800 --> 00:05:48.810 
patient we think this is only the

00:05:48.810 --> 00:05:52.700 
patient we think this is only the
beginning<00:05:49.020> a<00:05:49.500> lot<00:05:50.070> more<00:05:50.280> needs<00:05:50.580> to<00:05:50.700> be<00:05:50.820> done<00:05:51.710> we

00:05:52.700 --> 00:05:52.710 
beginning a lot more needs to be done we

00:05:52.710 --> 00:05:55.460 
beginning a lot more needs to be done we
lived<00:05:53.280> through<00:05:53.580> the<00:05:53.850> transplant<00:05:54.690> process<00:05:54.960> and

00:05:55.460 --> 00:05:55.470 
lived through the transplant process and

00:05:55.470 --> 00:05:57.530 
lived through the transplant process and
again<00:05:56.010> it's<00:05:56.160> a<00:05:56.280> very<00:05:56.460> long<00:05:56.729> process<00:05:57.030> to<00:05:57.300> be

00:05:57.530 --> 00:05:57.540 
again it's a very long process to be

00:05:57.540 --> 00:06:00.230 
again it's a very long process to be
able<00:05:57.630> to<00:05:57.900> substitute<00:05:58.380> the<00:05:58.910> defective<00:05:59.910> cells

00:06:00.230 --> 00:06:00.240 
able to substitute the defective cells

00:06:00.240 --> 00:06:03.610 
able to substitute the defective cells
with<00:06:00.510> the<00:06:00.540> new<00:06:00.750> ones<00:06:01.250> but<00:06:02.250> we're<00:06:02.790> glad

00:06:03.610 --> 00:06:03.620 
with the new ones but we're glad

00:06:03.620 --> 00:06:07.730 
with the new ones but we're glad

cute little child has a very rare
disease<00:06:11.150> but<00:06:12.150> fortunately<00:06:12.750> we've<00:06:13.020> been<00:06:13.200> able

00:06:13.340 --> 00:06:13.350 
disease but fortunately we've been able

00:06:13.350 --> 00:06:16.700 
disease but fortunately we've been able
to<00:06:13.500> make<00:06:13.860> two<00:06:14.280> new<00:06:14.610> stem<00:06:15.030> cell<00:06:15.330> lines<00:06:15.660> from<00:06:16.650> the

00:06:16.700 --> 00:06:16.710 
to make two new stem cell lines from the

00:06:16.710 --> 00:06:19.730 
to make two new stem cell lines from the
embryos<00:06:17.400> that<00:06:17.880> the<00:06:18.210> family<00:06:18.660> created<00:06:18.990> in<00:06:19.500> order

00:06:19.730 --> 00:06:19.740 
embryos that the family created in order

00:06:19.740 --> 00:06:22.880 
embryos that the family created in order
to<00:06:20.070> cure<00:06:20.340> andres<00:06:21.110> this<00:06:22.110> gives<00:06:22.500> us<00:06:22.740> an

00:06:22.880 --> 00:06:22.890 
to cure andres this gives us an

00:06:22.890 --> 00:06:26.409 
to cure andres this gives us an
inexhaustible<00:06:23.669> supply<00:06:24.270> of<00:06:24.890> diseased<00:06:25.890> cells

00:06:26.409 --> 00:06:26.419 
inexhaustible supply of diseased cells

00:06:26.419 --> 00:06:30.380 
inexhaustible supply of diseased cells
so<00:06:27.419> even<00:06:27.690> though<00:06:27.720> the<00:06:28.110> kids<00:06:28.830> are<00:06:29.040> rare<00:06:29.310> we<00:06:30.120> now

00:06:30.380 --> 00:06:30.390 
so even though the kids are rare we now

00:06:30.390 --> 00:06:37.709 
so even though the kids are rare we now
have<00:06:30.720> the<00:06:30.870> tools<00:06:31.080> that<00:06:31.440> we<00:06:31.590> can<00:06:31.890> study<00:06:32.220> forever
