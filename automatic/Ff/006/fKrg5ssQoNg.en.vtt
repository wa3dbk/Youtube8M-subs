00:00:06.410 --> 00:00:10.490
 Hello dear

 the body of our site 

00:00:10.490 --> 00:00:16.490
 new world now we have the middle of may and 

00:00:13.059 --> 00:00:19.790
 See how gorgeous blooms can not 

00:00:16.490 --> 00:00:22.390
 hollow leaf plant 

00:00:19.790 --> 00:00:23.720
 which we still rarely 

00:00:22.390 --> 00:00:26.419
 is grown 

00:00:23.720 --> 00:00:29.990
 gardens here massively at some 

00:00:26.419 --> 00:00:32.660
 it did not receive distribution though 

00:00:29.990 --> 00:00:35.480
 to its decorative properties this 

00:00:32.660 --> 00:00:36.290
 culture deserves more serious 

00:00:35.480 --> 00:00:38.960
 attention 

00:00:36.290 --> 00:00:41.540
 our gardeners lovers and now i'm 

00:00:38.960 --> 00:00:43.909
 I want a short one to tell here 

00:00:41.540 --> 00:00:46.250
 Now mid-May, look at what 

00:00:43.909 --> 00:00:49.519
 her wonderful inflorescences also 

00:00:46.250 --> 00:00:53.750
 fragrant and love to visit 

00:00:49.519 --> 00:00:55.760
 and bees and bumblebees and various other flies 

00:00:53.750 --> 00:00:58.309
 butterflies that is here if you are 

00:00:55.760 --> 00:01:00.799
 plant plant in the garden you still here 

00:00:58.309 --> 00:01:03.860
 these are wonderful winged animals 

00:01:00.799 --> 00:01:06.470
 year will appear too and you will feel 

00:01:03.860 --> 00:01:07.630
 very nice so tart honey 

00:01:06.470 --> 00:01:10.930
 aroma 

00:01:07.630 --> 00:01:15.409
 for such inflorescences which 

00:01:10.930 --> 00:01:17.780
 tassels bloom this Mahonia 

00:01:15.409 --> 00:01:20.630
 hollow leaves sometimes called yellow 

00:01:17.780 --> 00:01:23.810
 lilac you see for yourself that the flowers have 

00:01:20.630 --> 00:01:26.240
 it is small and collected rather dense 

00:01:23.810 --> 00:01:30.049
 such inflorescences they can be these 

00:01:26.240 --> 00:01:33.259
 inflorescences and even larger and if you 

00:01:30.049 --> 00:01:37.759
 provide this plant with proper care 

00:01:33.259 --> 00:01:38.859
 here here is far enough under the systems 

00:01:37.759 --> 00:01:41.539
 glaze 

00:01:38.859 --> 00:01:44.149
 settles this agony and therefore 

00:01:41.539 --> 00:01:48.560
 honestly say and little gets here 

00:01:44.149 --> 00:01:51.109
 what regular care and mostly 

00:01:48.560 --> 00:01:53.450
 She is content with only rainfall but 

00:01:51.109 --> 00:01:56.420
 look she feels great 

00:01:53.450 --> 00:01:59.799
 and blooms every year and that's what I want 

00:01:56.420 --> 00:02:02.990
 say she even without flowers very 

00:01:59.799 --> 00:02:06.289
 attractive look here look what 

00:02:02.990 --> 00:02:08.450
 glossy leaves and especially 

00:02:06.289 --> 00:02:11.840
 these still young leaves will be beautiful 

00:02:08.450 --> 00:02:14.420
 which began to grow from them precisely 

00:02:11.840 --> 00:02:16.880
 so distinctive here is a beautiful glossy 

00:02:14.420 --> 00:02:19.340
 the shine of its shape, these leaves resemble 

00:02:16.880 --> 00:02:22.060
 rose leaves 

00:02:19.340 --> 00:02:24.140
 they keep such a dense structure 

00:02:22.060 --> 00:02:26.780
 all year round all year 

00:02:24.140 --> 00:02:31.640
 plant this is notable because she 

00:02:26.780 --> 00:02:34.280
 the land is green and here in the photos you are on 

00:02:31.640 --> 00:02:37.730
 our still can see that in the winter 

00:02:34.280 --> 00:02:40.760
 under the snow these leaves are saved and this 

00:02:37.730 --> 00:02:43.340
 it looks altogether quite exotic 

00:02:40.760 --> 00:02:47.000
 you come and you have a garden under the snow here 

00:02:43.340 --> 00:02:50.269
 such a green bush is worth these autumn 

00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:52.760
 leaves turn red-orange 

00:02:50.269 --> 00:02:55.010
 colors if this plant is planted 

00:02:52.760 --> 00:02:58.910
 in the sun in general, I can not be hollow 

00:02:55.010 --> 00:03:01.099
 she endures and darkens and even more 

00:02:58.910 --> 00:03:03.410
 Feels comfortable there because 

00:03:01.099 --> 00:03:05.629
 here are these glossy dense leaves 

00:03:03.410 --> 00:03:08.329
 especially in early spring they can 

00:03:05.629 --> 00:03:10.970
 burn and that's the only such care 

00:03:08.329 --> 00:03:14.019
 who would need and time fire and if 

00:03:10.970 --> 00:03:18.590
 she is in the open sun it is planted 

00:03:14.019 --> 00:03:20.360
 shelter and for the winter for some reason 

00:03:18.590 --> 00:03:22.610
 materials it may be special 

00:03:20.360 --> 00:03:24.889
 pretty night net is so green now 

00:03:22.610 --> 00:03:25.910
 sold maybe you saw them or 

00:03:24.889 --> 00:03:29.000
 elementary 

00:03:25.910 --> 00:03:29.720
 sacking or some other handy 

00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:32.269
 material 

00:03:29.720 --> 00:03:36.380
 longer any special care of the car 

00:03:32.269 --> 00:03:39.430
 valiantly does not require 

00:03:36.380 --> 00:03:44.510
 how decorative this plant looks 

00:03:39.430 --> 00:03:46.639
 he also has wonderful fruits ripening 

00:03:44.510 --> 00:03:50.870
 after flowering 

00:03:46.639 --> 00:03:54.590
 they have such a lilac blue color 

00:03:50.870 --> 00:03:57.769
 these fruits are quite edible and they are not 

00:03:54.590 --> 00:04:00.620
 juicy like let's say blueberries have that 

00:03:57.769 --> 00:04:02.750
 so strong treasures but they may well 

00:04:00.620 --> 00:04:05.599
 be used for cooking 

00:04:02.750 --> 00:04:08.630
 compot home wines and 

00:04:05.599 --> 00:04:13.010
 fresh kids also sometimes 

00:04:08.630 --> 00:04:15.139
 shoot these fruits look too 

00:04:13.010 --> 00:04:17.260
 quite decorative in the photo to 

00:04:15.139 --> 00:04:19.609
 I'll show it all too and here is a combination 

00:04:17.260 --> 00:04:21.100
 autumn with these red-orange 

00:04:19.609 --> 00:04:24.070
 leaves you too 

00:04:21.100 --> 00:04:26.380
 it's all very, very nice 

00:04:24.070 --> 00:04:29.110
 You mean I can not sell this 

00:04:26.380 --> 00:04:31.810
 hollow now them in the garden 

00:04:29.110 --> 00:04:34.480
 centers and exhibitions now until the end 

00:04:31.810 --> 00:04:37.240
 May they work there is still an opportunity 

00:04:34.480 --> 00:04:40.230
 buy seedlings can not pada had dreams 

00:04:37.240 --> 00:04:44.500
 it is usually sold in containers 

00:04:40.230 --> 00:04:47.650
 well enough it grows that 

00:04:44.500 --> 00:04:49.000
 more important is the mind of fire and the potap of the valiant 

00:04:47.650 --> 00:04:52.120
 with such a one 

00:04:49.000 --> 00:04:55.540
 its exotic winter greenness and yes 

00:04:52.120 --> 00:04:58.360
 it hibernates beautifully in our climate and 

00:04:55.540 --> 00:05:00.730
 even if she has such happen 

00:04:58.360 --> 00:05:03.090
 burning leaves and look at it 

00:05:00.730 --> 00:05:06.460
 just burnt leaf 

00:05:03.090 --> 00:05:08.920
 leaves burn out then they sweat 

00:05:06.460 --> 00:05:10.570
 replaced by new leaves from plants 

00:05:08.920 --> 00:05:13.320
 grows well 

00:05:10.570 --> 00:05:15.040
 and blooms well here are wonderful plants 

00:05:13.320 --> 00:05:18.490
 remember the name 

00:05:15.040 --> 00:05:21.600
 I can not get hollow and 

00:05:18.490 --> 00:05:21.600
