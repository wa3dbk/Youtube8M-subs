so we have our beds measured out that

00:01:33.560 --> 00:01:35.620 
so we have our beds measured out that
tells<00:01:33.860> us<00:01:34.159> how<00:01:34.369> many<00:01:34.610> square<00:01:35.000> feet<00:01:35.030> are<00:01:35.570> in

00:01:35.620 --> 00:01:35.630

it up to the hose and once the container
is<00:02:18.280> emptied<00:02:18.670> all<00:02:18.940> the<00:02:19.569> nematodes<00:02:20.140> have<00:02:20.410> been

00:02:20.580 --> 00:02:20.590 
is emptied all the nematodes have been

00:02:20.590 --> 00:02:21.960 
is emptied all the nematodes have been
applied<00:02:20.950> to<00:02:20.980> this<00:02:21.370> bed

it's<00:02:22.239> very<00:02:22.569> good<00:02:22.989> to<00:02:23.350> apply<00:02:23.830> the<00:02:23.890> nematodes

00:02:24.630 --> 00:02:24.640 
it's very good to apply the nematodes

00:02:24.640 --> 00:02:27.420 
it's very good to apply the nematodes
when<00:02:25.060> it's<00:02:25.209> wet<00:02:25.630> so<00:02:26.049> we're<00:02:26.860> working<00:02:27.069> with
