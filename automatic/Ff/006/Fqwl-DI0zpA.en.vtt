board from Channel Islands called the

00:00:12.380 --> 00:00:16.090 
board from Channel Islands called the
number<00:00:12.650> 4<00:00:12.950> the<00:00:13.940> idea<00:00:14.840> behind<00:00:15.110> the<00:00:15.380> name<00:00:15.560> was

00:00:16.090 --> 00:00:16.100 
number 4 the idea behind the name was

00:00:16.100 --> 00:00:17.620 
number 4 the idea behind the name was
that<00:00:16.340> this<00:00:16.460> was<00:00:16.670> the<00:00:16.789> fourth<00:00:17.060> board<00:00:17.330> in<00:00:17.570> a

00:00:17.620 --> 00:00:17.630 
that this was the fourth board in a

00:00:17.630 --> 00:00:19.240 
that this was the fourth board in a
series<00:00:17.960> of<00:00:18.109> concepts<00:00:18.650> that<00:00:18.859> Dane<00:00:19.070> Reynolds

00:00:19.240 --> 00:00:19.250 
series of concepts that Dane Reynolds

00:00:19.250 --> 00:00:22.300 
series of concepts that Dane Reynolds
was<00:00:19.580> producing<00:00:20.060> for<00:00:20.420> the<00:00:20.600> US<00:00:20.840> Open<00:00:21.260> in<00:00:21.470> 2012

was producing for the US Open in 2012

00:00:22.310 --> 00:00:24.310 
was producing for the US Open in 2012
and<00:00:22.580> obviously<00:00:23.450> it<00:00:23.630> goes<00:00:23.810> through<00:00:24.020> a<00:00:24.050> lot<00:00:24.200> of

00:00:24.310 --> 00:00:24.320 
and obviously it goes through a lot of

00:00:24.320 --> 00:00:26.800 
and obviously it goes through a lot of
R&amp;D<00:00:24.590> before<00:00:25.070> getting<00:00:25.340> to<00:00:25.550> our<00:00:25.970> mere<00:00:26.420> mortal

00:00:26.800 --> 00:00:26.810 
R&amp;D before getting to our mere mortal

00:00:26.810 --> 00:00:29.410 
R&amp;D before getting to our mere mortal
hands<00:00:27.050> and<00:00:27.470> here<00:00:28.369> it<00:00:28.460> is<00:00:28.580> I<00:00:28.820> just<00:00:28.880> picked<00:00:29.240> it<00:00:29.330> up

00:00:29.410 --> 00:00:29.420 
hands and here it is I just picked it up

00:00:29.420 --> 00:00:32.740 
hands and here it is I just picked it up
yesterday<00:00:29.680> gave<00:00:30.680> it<00:00:30.800> a<00:00:30.860> surf<00:00:31.100> and<00:00:31.460> it's<00:00:31.789> it's<00:00:32.660> a

00:00:32.740 --> 00:00:32.750 
yesterday gave it a surf and it's it's a

00:00:32.750 --> 00:00:35.950 
yesterday gave it a surf and it's it's a
lot<00:00:32.930> of<00:00:32.960> fun<00:00:33.850> we're<00:00:34.850> based<00:00:35.060> here<00:00:35.300> in<00:00:35.420> Florida

00:00:35.950 --> 00:00:35.960 
lot of fun we're based here in Florida

00:00:35.960 --> 00:00:38.680 
lot of fun we're based here in Florida
so<00:00:36.260> this<00:00:36.470> is<00:00:36.620> a<00:00:36.649> great<00:00:36.950> board<00:00:37.310> for<00:00:37.690> everyday

00:00:38.680 --> 00:00:38.690 
so this is a great board for everyday

00:00:38.690 --> 00:00:41.710 
so this is a great board for everyday
surfing<00:00:39.350> it<00:00:39.590> has<00:00:40.040> that<00:00:40.520> fish<00:00:41.149> light<00:00:41.390> quality

00:00:41.710 --> 00:00:41.720 
surfing it has that fish light quality

00:00:41.720 --> 00:00:43.450 
surfing it has that fish light quality
that<00:00:42.260> allows<00:00:42.440> you<00:00:42.590> to<00:00:42.710> paddle<00:00:43.040> a<00:00:43.100> little<00:00:43.309> bit

00:00:43.450 --> 00:00:43.460 
that allows you to paddle a little bit

00:00:43.460 --> 00:00:45.450 
that allows you to paddle a little bit
better<00:00:43.640> obviously<00:00:44.180> written<00:00:44.720> a<00:00:44.870> lot<00:00:45.020> shorter

00:00:45.450 --> 00:00:45.460 
better obviously written a lot shorter

00:00:45.460 --> 00:00:48.400 
better obviously written a lot shorter
and<00:00:46.460> also<00:00:46.760> still<00:00:47.300> performs<00:00:47.840> like<00:00:47.989> a<00:00:48.020> modern

00:00:48.400 --> 00:00:48.410 
and also still performs like a modern

00:00:48.410 --> 00:00:52.540 
and also still performs like a modern
short<00:00:48.739> board<00:00:48.980> so<00:00:49.579> I'm<00:00:50.239> about<00:00:50.420> 510<00:00:51.050> 155<00:00:51.950> pounds

00:00:52.540 --> 00:00:52.550 
short board so I'm about 510 155 pounds

00:00:52.550 --> 00:00:54.790 
short board so I'm about 510 155 pounds
this<00:00:52.790> board<00:00:53.090> is<00:00:53.239> five<00:00:53.510> five<00:00:53.840> eighteen<00:00:54.620> and

00:00:54.790 --> 00:00:54.800 
this board is five five eighteen and

00:00:54.800 --> 00:00:56.020 
this board is five five eighteen and
seven<00:00:55.129> eighths<00:00:55.250> by<00:00:55.489> two<00:00:55.550> and<00:00:55.879> three

00:00:56.020 --> 00:00:56.030 
seven eighths by two and three

00:00:56.030 --> 00:00:58.330 
seven eighths by two and three
sixteenths<00:00:56.570> I've<00:00:57.170> just<00:00:57.469> now<00:00:57.620> tried<00:00:57.920> it<00:00:58.070> out<00:00:58.160> as

00:00:58.330 --> 00:00:58.340 
sixteenths I've just now tried it out as

00:00:58.340 --> 00:00:59.979 
sixteenths I've just now tried it out as
a<00:00:58.370> quad<00:00:58.670> and<00:00:58.940> I<00:00:59.030> plan<00:00:59.239> on<00:00:59.270> riding<00:00:59.600> it<00:00:59.840> as<00:00:59.960> a

00:00:59.979 --> 00:00:59.989 
a quad and I plan on riding it as a

00:00:59.989 --> 00:01:04.660 
a quad and I plan on riding it as a
thruster<00:01:01.600> it<00:01:02.600> is<00:01:02.960> a<00:01:02.989> perfect<00:01:03.829> blend<00:01:03.980> for<00:01:04.489> those

00:01:04.660 --> 00:01:04.670 
thruster it is a perfect blend for those

00:01:04.670 --> 00:01:05.950 
thruster it is a perfect blend for those
of<00:01:04.789> you<00:01:04.850> familiar<00:01:05.030> with<00:01:05.329> Channel<00:01:05.719> Islands

00:01:05.950 --> 00:01:05.960 
of you familiar with Channel Islands

00:01:05.960 --> 00:01:08.200 
of you familiar with Channel Islands
with<00:01:06.170> the<00:01:06.320> neck<00:01:06.560> beard<00:01:06.860> and<00:01:07.159> the<00:01:07.610> dumpster

00:01:08.200 --> 00:01:08.210 
with the neck beard and the dumpster

00:01:08.210 --> 00:01:10.660 
with the neck beard and the dumpster
diver<00:01:08.450> so<00:01:08.930> it<00:01:09.290> has<00:01:09.470> a<00:01:09.500> lot<00:01:09.770> of<00:01:09.799> qualities<00:01:10.400> like

00:01:10.660 --> 00:01:10.670 
diver so it has a lot of qualities like

00:01:10.670 --> 00:01:13.120 
diver so it has a lot of qualities like
the<00:01:10.820> forward<00:01:11.180> outline<00:01:11.540> at<00:01:11.720> the<00:01:11.810> neck<00:01:12.020> beard<00:01:12.260> a

00:01:13.120 --> 00:01:13.130 
the forward outline at the neck beard a

00:01:13.130 --> 00:01:15.370 
the forward outline at the neck beard a
nice<00:01:13.610> neutral<00:01:14.090> rocker<00:01:14.390> it<00:01:14.659> doesn't<00:01:14.990> have<00:01:15.110> much

00:01:15.370 --> 00:01:15.380 
nice neutral rocker it doesn't have much

00:01:15.380 --> 00:01:17.320 
nice neutral rocker it doesn't have much
if<00:01:15.710> you're<00:01:15.920> looking<00:01:16.190> at<00:01:16.340> it<00:01:16.490> but<00:01:17.030> it<00:01:17.119> does<00:01:17.299> have

00:01:17.320 --> 00:01:17.330 
if you're looking at it but it does have

00:01:17.330 --> 00:01:19.359 
if you're looking at it but it does have
a<00:01:17.510> little<00:01:18.140> bit<00:01:18.290> more<00:01:18.560> than<00:01:18.860> the<00:01:18.950> neck<00:01:19.130> beard

00:01:19.359 --> 00:01:19.369 
a little bit more than the neck beard

00:01:19.369 --> 00:01:21.370 
a little bit more than the neck beard
but<00:01:19.640> not<00:01:19.880> as<00:01:20.180> much<00:01:20.420> as<00:01:20.689> the<00:01:20.840> dumpster<00:01:21.170> diver

00:01:21.370 --> 00:01:21.380 
but not as much as the dumpster diver

00:01:21.380 --> 00:01:24.330 
but not as much as the dumpster diver
it's<00:01:21.950> a<00:01:22.010> very<00:01:22.220> versatile<00:01:22.760> board<00:01:23.090> kind<00:01:23.750> of<00:01:23.840> the

00:01:24.330 --> 00:01:24.340 
it's a very versatile board kind of the

00:01:24.340 --> 00:01:27.910 
it's a very versatile board kind of the
one<00:01:25.340> board<00:01:25.610> quiver<00:01:25.939> if<00:01:26.270> you<00:01:26.510> will<00:01:26.720> for<00:01:27.200> small

00:01:27.910 --> 00:01:27.920 
one board quiver if you will for small

00:01:27.920 --> 00:01:31.000 
one board quiver if you will for small
to<00:01:28.490> a<00:01:28.520> group<00:01:28.880> surf<00:01:29.119> the<00:01:29.960> wings<00:01:30.229> help<00:01:30.560> pull<00:01:30.860> in

00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:31.010 
to a group surf the wings help pull in

00:01:31.010 --> 00:01:34.420 
to a group surf the wings help pull in
the<00:01:31.159> outline<00:01:31.549> I<00:01:31.820> think<00:01:32.619> somewhat<00:01:33.619> some<00:01:34.280> of<00:01:34.369> the

00:01:34.420 --> 00:01:34.430 
the outline I think somewhat some of the

00:01:34.430 --> 00:01:36.490 
the outline I think somewhat some of the
feedback<00:01:34.820> on<00:01:35.000> the<00:01:35.119> neckbeard<00:01:35.540> whether<00:01:36.259> it<00:01:36.380> be

00:01:36.490 --> 00:01:36.500 
feedback on the neckbeard whether it be

00:01:36.500 --> 00:01:38.200 
feedback on the neckbeard whether it be
positive<00:01:36.710> or<00:01:37.070> negative<00:01:37.430> is<00:01:37.520> that<00:01:37.670> attract<00:01:38.090> a

00:01:38.200 --> 00:01:38.210 
positive or negative is that attract a

00:01:38.210 --> 00:01:39.910 
positive or negative is that attract a
little<00:01:38.450> bit<00:01:38.600> and<00:01:38.810> that's<00:01:38.960> such<00:01:39.259> down<00:01:39.560> the<00:01:39.740> line

00:01:39.910 --> 00:01:39.920 
little bit and that's such down the line

00:01:39.920 --> 00:01:42.460 
little bit and that's such down the line
drive<00:01:40.250> and<00:01:40.520> speed<00:01:40.790> that<00:01:41.299> I'm<00:01:41.450> really<00:01:41.810> whipping

00:01:42.460 --> 00:01:42.470 
drive and speed that I'm really whipping

00:01:42.470 --> 00:01:45.310 
drive and speed that I'm really whipping
a<00:01:42.590> tighter<00:01:42.860> arc<00:01:43.330> was<00:01:44.330> difficult<00:01:44.869> because<00:01:45.080> you

00:01:45.310 --> 00:01:45.320 
a tighter arc was difficult because you

00:01:45.320 --> 00:01:47.260 
a tighter arc was difficult because you
had<00:01:45.530> a<00:01:45.560> large<00:01:45.950> planing<00:01:46.460> surface<00:01:46.790> behind<00:01:47.090> your

00:01:47.260 --> 00:01:47.270 
had a large planing surface behind your

00:01:47.270 --> 00:01:49.450 
had a large planing surface behind your
foot<00:01:47.509> so<00:01:48.049> you've<00:01:48.259> got<00:01:48.409> two<00:01:48.710> wings<00:01:48.979> like<00:01:49.220> this

00:01:49.450 --> 00:01:49.460 
foot so you've got two wings like this

00:01:49.460 --> 00:01:51.520 
foot so you've got two wings like this
which<00:01:50.000> drastically<00:01:50.270> pulls<00:01:50.840> in<00:01:51.049> the<00:01:51.170> outline

00:01:51.520 --> 00:01:51.530 
which drastically pulls in the outline

00:01:51.530 --> 00:01:53.590 
which drastically pulls in the outline
gives<00:01:51.890> you<00:01:52.009> a<00:01:52.070> little<00:01:52.400> bit<00:01:52.549> of<00:01:52.729> a<00:01:53.240> pivot<00:01:53.570> point

00:01:53.590 --> 00:01:53.600 
gives you a little bit of a pivot point

00:01:53.600 --> 00:01:57.310 
gives you a little bit of a pivot point
and<00:01:54.159> allows<00:01:55.159> you<00:01:55.490> to<00:01:55.820> turn<00:01:56.450> it<00:01:56.689> harder<00:01:57.140> than

00:01:57.310 --> 00:01:57.320 
and allows you to turn it harder than

00:01:57.320 --> 00:02:00.340 
and allows you to turn it harder than
you<00:01:57.439> would<00:01:57.470> really<00:01:58.310> white-tailed<00:01:58.909> fish<00:01:59.350> come

00:02:00.340 --> 00:02:00.350 
you would really white-tailed fish come

00:02:00.350 --> 00:02:01.870 
you would really white-tailed fish come
standard<00:02:00.710> as<00:02:00.860> a<00:02:00.890> squash<00:02:01.220> like<00:02:01.490> we<00:02:01.610> were<00:02:01.700> saying

00:02:01.870 --> 00:02:01.880 
standard as a squash like we were saying

00:02:01.880 --> 00:02:04.780 
standard as a squash like we were saying
before<00:02:02.030> so<00:02:03.020> you're<00:02:03.710> getting<00:02:04.070> above<00:02:04.490> the<00:02:04.610> lip

00:02:04.780 --> 00:02:04.790 
before so you're getting above the lip

00:02:04.790 --> 00:02:07.600 
before so you're getting above the lip
type<00:02:05.030> turning<00:02:05.509> really<00:02:05.960> good<00:02:06.170> on<00:02:06.290> a<00:02:06.320> rail<00:02:06.619> short

00:02:07.600 --> 00:02:07.610 
type turning really good on a rail short

00:02:07.610 --> 00:02:11.019 
type turning really good on a rail short
little<00:02:07.790> curves<00:02:08.679> arcing<00:02:09.679> turns<00:02:09.890> and<00:02:10.429> it<00:02:10.789> still

00:02:11.019 --> 00:02:11.029 
little curves arcing turns and it still

00:02:11.029 --> 00:02:12.410 
little curves arcing turns and it still
has<00:02:11.209> a<00:02:11.239> lot<00:02:11.510> of<00:02:11.540> down<00:02:11.779> the<00:02:11.930> line

00:02:12.410 --> 00:02:12.420 
has a lot of down the line

00:02:12.420 --> 00:02:15.410 
has a lot of down the line
so<00:02:13.290> this<00:02:13.620> is<00:02:13.770> the<00:02:13.920> number<00:02:14.190> four<00:02:14.430> and<00:02:14.760> I'm<00:02:15.300> gonna

00:02:15.410 --> 00:02:15.420 
so this is the number four and I'm gonna

00:02:15.420 --> 00:02:19.850 
so this is the number four and I'm gonna
go<00:02:15.600> surf<00:02:15.900> so<00:02:16.860> we<00:02:17.340> can<00:02:17.459> check<00:02:17.610> it<00:02:17.670> out
