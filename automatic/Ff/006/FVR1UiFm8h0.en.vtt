00:00:02.530 --> 00:00:06.339
 in this video they are authentic 

00:00:03.729 --> 00:00:07.750
 professionals please do not try 

00:00:06.339 --> 00:00:10.269
 campear in your house and play legal 

00:00:07.750 --> 00:00:12.690
 otherwise they could leave someday 

00:00:10.269 --> 00:00:12.690
 in this top 

00:00:16.410 --> 00:00:20.820
 and we started the tournament 5 this week 

00:00:18.810 --> 00:00:23.880
 in a corner that the truth is 

00:00:20.820 --> 00:00:25.650
 winning a medal by corner so much what 

00:00:23.880 --> 00:00:27.390
 we can see here watching the flag of 

00:00:25.650 --> 00:00:29.189
 goodbye back I'm going to put on here over 

00:00:27.390 --> 00:00:31.590
 behind him but suddenly they kill me in 

00:00:29.189 --> 00:00:33.000
 I already say the second time 

00:00:31.590 --> 00:00:35.460
 they do not have to miss the opportunity 

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:37.019
 to record this character here 

00:00:35.460 --> 00:00:39.269
 camping so I put the batteries 

00:00:37.019 --> 00:00:41.190
 I go quickly behind where was the 

00:00:39.269 --> 00:00:44.340
 again to see if this time I can go to 

00:00:41.190 --> 00:00:45.780

00:00:44.340 --> 00:00:47.150
 that I have escaped is from campero 

00:00:45.780 --> 00:00:50.250

00:00:47.150 --> 00:00:51.510
 It is here we will start well let's 

00:00:50.250 --> 00:00:52.680

00:00:51.510 --> 00:00:54.510
 'bolillo' to see if I give him an Augustinian 

00:00:52.680 --> 00:00:57.680

00:01:02.530 --> 00:01:06.430
 in the top number 4 we find the 

00:01:04.540 --> 00:01:08.229
 map of Detroit in a domain about to 

00:01:06.430 --> 00:01:10.030
 finish the first round and I 

00:01:08.229 --> 00:01:12.880
 I find here in this room the 

00:01:10.030 --> 00:01:14.710
 the window that we all say to me 

00:01:12.880 --> 00:01:16.299
 I find here a carpet here they have 

00:01:14.710 --> 00:01:18.070
 the floor that is is plugging the 

00:01:16.299 --> 00:01:19.990
 pira activity I do not know what for 

00:01:18.070 --> 00:01:22.420

00:01:23.649 --> 00:01:28.060
 go out to each one death to make it look 

00:01:25.149 --> 00:01:30.610
 I love that the campers kiss 

00:01:28.060 --> 00:01:33.159
 see engravings himself to see if 

00:01:30.610 --> 00:01:35.800
 they realize and if they stop 

00:01:33.159 --> 00:01:38.340
 watch the camper repeat the face 

00:01:35.800 --> 00:01:40.259
 of my mother would 

00:01:38.340 --> 00:01:43.490
 what bastards are here is 

00:01:40.259 --> 00:01:43.490
 listening to my friend in the background 

00:01:47.409 --> 00:01:52.359
 we went to the top number 3 and we are in the 

00:01:50.109 --> 00:01:54.729
 most frantic map of the entire game already 

00:01:52.359 --> 00:01:56.590
 that here in talave is almost impossible and 

00:01:54.729 --> 00:01:58.659
 half here after the bomber I see myself 

00:01:56.590 --> 00:02:00.609
 that an uncle who has survived this 

00:01:58.659 --> 00:02:02.709
 this one has I do not know what he does here not 

00:02:00.609 --> 00:02:05.200
 let's put it slowly stealthily 

00:02:02.709 --> 00:02:07.000
 really in front of him 

00:02:05.200 --> 00:02:08.679
 now we take advantage of that it turns I say 

00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:11.080
 let's do here your next fac 

00:02:08.679 --> 00:02:15.209
 and we punch him in the face 

00:02:11.080 --> 00:02:15.209
 let's see little 

00:02:17.400 --> 00:02:22.110
 we went to the top number 2 and we are in the 

00:02:20.549 --> 00:02:23.879
 map the horizon here we have a 

00:02:22.110 --> 00:02:26.610
 change that shot the sky moves 

00:02:23.879 --> 00:02:28.349
 and it has moved us is firing towards 

00:02:26.610 --> 00:02:30.959
 forward I do not know why he's shooting at 

00:02:28.349 --> 00:02:32.220
 the wall I do not know if once fixed we're going to 

00:02:30.959 --> 00:02:34.409
 do a funny thing we're going to 

00:02:32.220 --> 00:02:36.989
 return the skewer and put it in 

00:02:34.409 --> 00:02:38.970
 his forehead so he had me behind him and 

00:02:36.989 --> 00:02:39.810
 melon iced and I put it in all the 

00:02:38.970 --> 00:02:42.799
 front

 this on top of a piggy camper deserves 

00:03:05.680 --> 00:03:09.250

00:03:07.300 --> 00:03:11.160
