00:00:16.460 --> 00:00:18.960
So, here we are with Dj Noppe

00:00:18.960 --> 00:00:25.220
in the backroom of Berlin´s „Asphalt Club", right next to Gendarmenmarkt right in the centre

00:00:25.220 --> 00:00:26.529
of the capital.

00:00:26.529 --> 00:00:30.469
So first I really would like to know, when you first started using the name?

00:00:30.469 --> 00:00:34.040
The first time I was seventeen or eighteen years old and

00:00:34.040 --> 00:00:36.960
I saw, how the Dj mixed with the records

00:00:36.960 --> 00:00:38.330
and that was

00:00:38.330 --> 00:00:39.420
my biggest

00:00:39.420 --> 00:00:42.140
inspiration

00:00:42.140 --> 00:00:43.140
and i've tried it

00:00:43.140 --> 00:00:46.230
I tried it. I learned and learned, all day, all night,

00:00:46.230 --> 00:00:47.640
all night long.

00:00:47.640 --> 00:00:50.860
I learned and learned and yeah,

00:00:52.180 --> 00:00:55.710
this was the first step. Then they asked me, hey, which name

00:00:55.710 --> 00:00:58.740
we have to put on the flyer

00:00:58.740 --> 00:00:59.840
mhm, and I said: Dj Noppe.

00:00:59.840 --> 00:01:02.630
I didn´t think about another name so...ok, you keep listening...

00:01:02.630 --> 00:01:03.760
okay

00:01:03.760 --> 00:01:10.760
Take the same thing of the mixed tape!

00:01:20.720 --> 00:01:22.680
I know a lot of Djs, they stopped Dj`ing,

00:01:22.680 --> 00:01:27.880
because they don´t like the new sound no more and

00:01:27.880 --> 00:01:28.819
but

00:01:28.819 --> 00:01:32.440
for me I need the new sound every time

00:01:32.440 --> 00:01:36.640
I mix it up with old classics,

00:01:36.640 --> 00:01:38.760
some favourite songs, but

00:01:38.760 --> 00:01:41.220
basically I need

00:01:41.220 --> 00:01:43.740
the new songs

00:01:43.740 --> 00:01:50.740
and ehm...it´s fine...

00:02:12.109 --> 00:02:14.419
You have better clubs around the world of course,

00:02:14.419 --> 00:02:15.949
but you have everything in Berlin. You can celebrate all day, all night long, seven days

00:02:15.949 --> 00:02:18.409
a week, 24 hours.

00:02:18.409 --> 00:02:21.150
You can go, leave this club, go to another club,

00:02:21.150 --> 00:02:26.159
come back home after five days. You don´t have to sleep

00:02:26.159 --> 00:02:30.379
Thursday I am Dj `ing, every thursday in the Felix, I am Dj `ing every friday

00:02:30.379 --> 00:02:31.620
in the Asphalt

00:02:31.620 --> 00:02:33.109
and I Dj every saturday,

00:02:33.109 --> 00:02:40.109
some saturdays in the Adagio.

00:02:40.199 --> 00:02:44.849
So, ehm, find out everything, every club

00:02:44.849 --> 00:02:51.849
and go home and tell me, what was the best club.

00:02:54.980 --> 00:02:55.749
Grey hair,

00:02:55.749 --> 00:02:57.189
still Dj ìng?

00:02:57.189 --> 00:02:59.180
Yeah, I am dying

00:02:59.180 --> 00:02:59.840
behind

00:02:59.840 --> 00:03:01.710
the Dj booth.

00:03:01.710 --> 00:03:04.969
yeah, when you see me, oh, he´s, he´s

00:03:04.969 --> 00:03:09.059
