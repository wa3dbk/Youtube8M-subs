00:01:39.840 --> 00:01:39.850 
would add some Chronos Mogra I guess

00:01:39.850 --> 00:01:41.730 
would add some Chronos Mogra I guess
it's<00:01:40.000> already<00:01:40.360> 80<00:01:40.780> years<00:01:41.140> old<00:01:41.409> something<00:01:41.620> like

00:01:41.730 --> 00:01:41.740 
it's already 80 years old something like

00:01:41.740 --> 00:01:44.450 
it's already 80 years old something like
that<00:01:41.980> the<00:01:42.970> clutch<00:01:43.270> I<00:01:43.510> found<00:01:43.840> somewhere<00:01:44.229> in

00:01:44.450 --> 00:01:44.460 
that the clutch I found somewhere in

that the clutch I found somewhere in
this<00:01:45.460> grip<00:01:46.050> this<00:01:47.050> motor<00:01:47.320> is<00:01:47.409> a<00:01:47.560> little<00:01:47.860> bit

00:01:47.940 --> 00:01:47.950 
this grip this motor is a little bit

00:01:47.950 --> 00:01:50.730 
this grip this motor is a little bit
special<00:01:48.460> because<00:01:48.700> it's<00:01:49.060> got<00:01:49.180> only<00:01:49.479> slow<00:01:50.470> refs

00:01:50.730 --> 00:01:50.740 
special because it's got only slow refs

00:01:50.740 --> 00:01:54.330 
special because it's got only slow refs
nominal<00:01:51.340> speed<00:01:51.490> at<00:01:51.670> 7.50<00:01:52.540> rpms<00:01:53.080> so<00:01:53.950> it<00:01:54.100> fits

00:01:54.330 --> 00:01:54.340 
nominal speed at 7.50 rpms so it fits

00:01:54.340 --> 00:01:59.830 
nominal speed at 7.50 rpms so it fits
perfect<00:01:55.030> to<00:01:55.920> the<00:01:56.920> list<00:01:57.340> engine

00:01:59.830 --> 00:01:59.840 
perfect to the list engine

00:01:59.840 --> 00:02:04.319 
perfect to the list engine
you<00:02:00.439> will<00:02:00.619> get<00:02:00.770> also<00:02:01.670> a<00:02:02.799> nexus<00:02:03.799> guess

00:02:04.319 --> 00:02:04.329 
you will get also a nexus guess

00:02:04.329 --> 00:02:06.550 
you will get also a nexus guess
temperature<00:02:05.329> gauge<00:02:05.539> so<00:02:05.960> it's<00:02:06.140> very<00:02:06.289> very

00:02:06.550 --> 00:02:06.560 
temperature gauge so it's very very

00:02:06.560 --> 00:02:11.140 
temperature gauge so it's very very
important<00:02:06.920> here<00:02:07.609> we<00:02:07.729> got<00:02:07.880> a<00:02:07.909> few<00:02:09.879> booster<00:02:10.879> pump

00:02:11.140 --> 00:02:11.150 
important here we got a few booster pump

00:02:11.150 --> 00:02:13.180 
important here we got a few booster pump
because<00:02:11.540> I<00:02:11.660> don't<00:02:11.870> like<00:02:12.019> to<00:02:12.260> see<00:02:13.129> the

00:02:13.180 --> 00:02:13.190 
because I don't like to see the

00:02:13.190 --> 00:02:16.539 
because I don't like to see the
equipment<00:02:14.120> by<00:02:14.510> gravity<00:02:15.050> in<00:02:16.040> case<00:02:16.250> you<00:02:16.370> got<00:02:16.489> a

00:02:16.539 --> 00:02:16.549 
equipment by gravity in case you got a

00:02:16.549 --> 00:02:20.320 
equipment by gravity in case you got a
leakage<00:02:17.140> with<00:02:18.140> a<00:02:18.170> gravity<00:02:18.560> based<00:02:18.799> system<00:02:19.400> this

00:02:20.320 --> 00:02:20.330 
leakage with a gravity based system this

00:02:20.330 --> 00:02:22.270 
leakage with a gravity based system this
will<00:02:20.540> empty<00:02:20.870> the<00:02:21.080> whole<00:02:21.319> tank<00:02:21.680> in<00:02:22.069> your

00:02:22.270 --> 00:02:22.280 
will empty the whole tank in your

00:02:22.280 --> 00:02:26.800 
will empty the whole tank in your
equipment<00:02:22.519> and<00:02:22.819> in<00:02:23.209> your<00:02:23.390> share<00:02:23.870> and<00:02:25.599> not<00:02:26.599> so

good<00:02:26.989> anyway<00:02:27.590> I<00:02:27.680> like<00:02:27.980> to<00:02:28.099> start<00:02:28.430> it<00:02:28.519> up<00:02:29.620> first

00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:31.010 
good anyway I like to start it up first

00:02:31.010 --> 00:02:35.610 
good anyway I like to start it up first
usually<00:02:31.880> I<00:02:32.380> have<00:02:33.380> to<00:02:33.739> activate<00:02:34.610> pre<00:02:34.910> heater

00:02:35.610 --> 00:02:35.620 
usually I have to activate pre heater

00:02:35.620 --> 00:02:39.000

00:05:41.770 --> 00:05:41.780 
shutting off the engineer case some

00:05:41.780 --> 00:05:44.290 
shutting off the engineer case some
smoke<00:05:42.080> is<00:05:42.320> developed<00:05:42.950> in<00:05:43.430> the<00:05:43.940> equipment

00:05:44.290 --> 00:05:44.300 
smoke is developed in the equipment

00:05:44.300 --> 00:05:48.100 
smoke is developed in the equipment
which<00:05:44.539> always<00:05:45.610> is<00:05:46.610> an<00:05:46.910> indication<00:05:47.270> for<00:05:47.419> very

00:05:48.100 --> 00:05:48.110 
which always is an indication for very

00:05:48.110 --> 00:05:50.770 
which always is an indication for very
soon<00:05:48.440> break<00:05:49.160> down<00:05:49.370> fill<00:05:49.669> or<00:05:49.789> whatever<00:05:50.000> so

00:05:50.770 --> 00:05:50.780 
soon break down fill or whatever so

00:05:50.780 --> 00:05:55.900 
soon break down fill or whatever so
connect<00:05:51.560> smoke<00:05:52.400> detector<00:05:52.789> to<00:05:54.310> the<00:05:55.310> alarm<00:05:55.729> and

this<00:05:59.389> is<00:05:59.510> Jason<00:05:59.870> adds<00:06:00.289> another<00:06:00.740> fun<00:06:01.130> and

00:06:01.600 --> 00:06:01.610 
this is Jason adds another fun and

00:06:01.610 --> 00:06:06.040 
this is Jason adds another fun and
interesting<00:06:01.910> see<00:06:02.180> here<00:06:03.020> we<00:06:03.139> got<00:06:05.050> what's

00:06:06.040 --> 00:06:06.050 
interesting see here we got what's

00:06:06.050 --> 00:06:09.960 
interesting see here we got what's
called<00:06:06.320> energy<00:06:07.220> counter<00:06:07.789> you<00:06:08.720> can<00:06:08.900> compare

00:06:09.960 --> 00:06:09.970 
called energy counter you can compare

00:06:09.970 --> 00:06:14.890 
called energy counter you can compare
that's<00:06:10.970> a<00:06:11.030> second<00:06:11.389> but<00:06:12.849> you<00:06:13.849> can<00:06:14.030> compare<00:06:14.389> the

00:06:14.890 --> 00:06:14.900 
that's a second but you can compare the

00:06:14.900 --> 00:06:17.770 
that's a second but you can compare the
energy<00:06:15.550> developed<00:06:16.550> Zeit<00:06:17.270> and<00:06:17.479> as<00:06:17.570> you<00:06:17.690> develop

00:06:17.770 --> 00:06:17.780 
energy developed Zeit and as you develop

00:06:17.780 --> 00:06:22.210 
energy developed Zeit and as you develop
on<00:06:18.110> the<00:06:18.169> system<00:06:18.470> with<00:06:19.450> the<00:06:21.099> electric<00:06:22.099> power

00:06:22.210 --> 00:06:22.220 
on the system with the electric power

00:06:22.220 --> 00:06:24.969 
on the system with the electric power
developed<00:06:22.940> but<00:06:23.270> Z<00:06:23.510> so<00:06:23.570> this<00:06:23.780> is<00:06:23.840> the<00:06:23.990> power<00:06:24.229> fed

00:06:24.969 --> 00:06:24.979 
developed but Z so this is the power fed

00:06:24.979 --> 00:06:30.300 
developed but Z so this is the power fed
back<00:06:25.190> into<00:06:25.220> the<00:06:25.639> grid<00:06:25.760> and<00:06:27.310> this<00:06:28.870> is<00:06:29.870> the<00:06:30.080> power

00:06:30.300 --> 00:06:30.310 
back into the grid and this is the power

00:06:30.310 --> 00:06:33.030 
back into the grid and this is the power
fed<00:06:31.310> until<00:06:31.520> your

00:06:33.030 --> 00:06:33.040 
fed until your

00:06:33.040 --> 00:06:37.630 
fed until your
central<00:06:34.040> heating<00:06:34.070> and<00:06:35.650> this<00:06:36.650> here<00:06:37.250> we<00:06:37.400> kept

00:06:37.630 --> 00:06:37.640 
central heating and this here we kept

00:06:37.640 --> 00:06:44.290 
central heating and this here we kept
with<00:06:38.120> it<00:06:40.840> this<00:06:41.840> venture<00:06:42.140> thermostat<00:06:43.150> so<00:06:44.150> in

00:06:44.290 --> 00:06:44.300 
with it this venture thermostat so in

00:06:44.300 --> 00:06:47.530 
with it this venture thermostat so in
