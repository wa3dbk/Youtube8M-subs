00:00:05.070 --> 00:00:09.070
 I welcome you in this video, we 

00:00:07.690 --> 00:00:10.630
 unpack 

00:00:09.070 --> 00:00:13.540
 or virtual boxing 

00:00:10.630 --> 00:00:15.550
 reality oculus rift at the time of recording 

00:00:13.540 --> 00:00:16.270
 roller official release points not yet 

00:00:15.550 --> 00:00:18.610
 took place 

00:00:16.270 --> 00:00:20.770
 however , only the so-called 

00:00:18.610 --> 00:00:23.110
 version for developers gave buttons 

00:00:20.770 --> 00:00:24.760
 if you believe the Internet announcement exit 

00:00:23.110 --> 00:00:26.110
 the final version is scheduled for 3 

00:00:24.760 --> 00:00:27.730
 quarter of 2014 

00:00:26.110 --> 00:00:29.890
 now we have an interesting opportunity 

00:00:27.730 --> 00:00:33.340
 look what exactly is 

00:00:29.890 --> 00:00:35.890
 about the font on the usual brown 

00:00:33.340 --> 00:00:39.390
 the box tells us that the data 

00:00:35.890 --> 00:00:39.390
 glasses designed in california 

00:00:45.170 --> 00:00:50.050
 on pretty 

00:00:47.560 --> 00:00:52.420
 and we see the engraving near below the inscription 

00:00:50.050 --> 00:00:54.840
 about what it gave the plant kit or set 

00:00:52.420 --> 00:00:54.840
 developer 

00:00:57.130 --> 00:01:02.080
 inside there is an English-speaking 

00:00:59.540 --> 00:01:02.080
 instruction 

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:09.670
 a set of wires among which hd may 

00:01:10.300 --> 00:01:18.350
 adapter to divey 

00:01:11.930 --> 00:01:22.870
 the wire itself is also a network adapter 

00:01:18.350 --> 00:01:22.870
 with a typical america plug 

00:01:30.970 --> 00:01:36.100
 next to it are various adapters in that 

00:01:33.760 --> 00:01:38.280
 number and on the usual connector for the adapter 

00:01:36.100 --> 00:01:38.280
 power supply 

00:01:44.600 --> 00:01:49.430
 bag with three pairs of wrapped lenses 

00:01:47.390 --> 00:01:57.220
 in a few rags 

00:01:49.430 --> 00:01:57.220
 and the glasses themselves 

00:02:02.650 --> 00:02:06.280
 without installed lenses we can see 

00:02:05.200 --> 00:02:11.460
 7 inch screen 

00:02:06.280 --> 00:02:11.460
 whose resolution is 1280 by 800 pixels 

00:02:12.870 --> 00:02:18.250
 the image is fed distorted on both 

00:02:16.360 --> 00:02:25.960
 eyes but straightens directly behind 

00:02:18.250 --> 00:02:27.360
 installed lens count and block 

00:02:25.960 --> 00:02:30.940

00:02:27.360 --> 00:02:34.240

00:02:30.940 --> 00:02:41.830

00:02:41.830 --> 00:02:49.959
 enable and control brightness and 

00:02:44.410 --> 00:02:52.390
 by contrast and that's all that was 

00:02:49.959 --> 00:02:53.290
