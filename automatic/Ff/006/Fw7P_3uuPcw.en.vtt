00:01:49.969 --> 00:01:49.979 
nightmare for them when they were

00:01:49.979 --> 00:01:51.679 
nightmare for them when they were
working<00:01:50.610> out<00:01:50.909> the<00:01:51.030> settlement<00:01:51.479> they<00:01:51.630> were

working out the settlement they were

00:01:51.689 --> 00:01:54.289 
working out the settlement they were
alleging<00:01:52.470> that<00:01:52.500> even<00:01:53.280> though<00:01:53.460> the<00:01:53.850> Walmart

00:01:54.289 --> 00:01:54.299 
alleging that even though the Walmart

alleging that even though the Walmart
truck<00:01:54.600> rear-ended<00:01:54.899> the<00:01:55.170> limo<00:01:55.439> and<00:01:55.649> caused

00:01:55.880 --> 00:01:55.890 
truck rear-ended the limo and caused

00:01:55.890 --> 00:01:57.800 
truck rear-ended the limo and caused
this<00:01:56.100> serious<00:01:56.430> accident<00:01:56.969> well<00:01:57.390> the<00:01:57.479> people<00:01:57.630> in

00:01:57.800 --> 00:01:57.810 
this serious accident well the people in

00:01:57.810 --> 00:01:59.690 
this serious accident well the people in
the<00:01:57.869> limo<00:01:58.049> weren't<00:01:58.469> wearing<00:01:58.680> a<00:01:58.860> seat<00:01:59.100> belt<00:01:59.130> so

00:01:59.690 --> 00:01:59.700 
the limo weren't wearing a seat belt so

00:01:59.700 --> 00:02:02.209 
the limo weren't wearing a seat belt so
it's<00:01:59.909> not<00:02:00.030> really<00:02:00.360> 100%<00:02:00.540> their<00:02:01.200> fault<00:02:01.469> Walmart

00:02:02.209 --> 00:02:02.219 
it's not really 100% their fault Walmart

00:02:02.219 --> 00:02:04.039 
it's not really 100% their fault Walmart
didn't<00:02:02.430> want<00:02:02.549> to<00:02:02.640> pay<00:02:02.790> out<00:02:02.969> as<00:02:03.240> much<00:02:03.479> as<00:02:03.719> you

00:02:04.039 --> 00:02:04.049 
didn't want to pay out as much as you

00:02:04.049 --> 00:02:06.709 
didn't want to pay out as much as you
know<00:02:04.200> they<00:02:04.740> were<00:02:04.799> asked<00:02:05.250> for<00:02:05.399> and<00:02:05.670> so<00:02:06.149> I<00:02:06.420> guess

00:02:06.709 --> 00:02:06.719 
know they were asked for and so I guess

00:02:06.719 --> 00:02:09.320 
know they were asked for and so I guess
later<00:02:07.110> on<00:02:07.380> they<00:02:07.740> kind<00:02:07.979> of<00:02:08.039> decided<00:02:08.940> that's<00:02:09.119> not

00:02:09.320 --> 00:02:09.330 
later on they kind of decided that's not

00:02:09.330 --> 00:02:11.330 
later on they kind of decided that's not
