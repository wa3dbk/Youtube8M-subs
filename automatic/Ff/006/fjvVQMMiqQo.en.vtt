00:00:00.210 --> 00:00:04.080
 hi again everyone today we are going to 

00:00:02.189 --> 00:00:07.170
 learn how to place a protector 

00:00:04.080 --> 00:00:09.300
 screen for our mobile phone 

00:00:07.170 --> 00:00:11.040
 For this we need unique and 

00:00:09.300 --> 00:00:14.190
 exclusively three things first thing 

00:00:11.040 --> 00:00:16.680
 would be a microfiber mop with which 

00:00:14.190 --> 00:00:18.540
 we will clean the screen to clean the 

00:00:16.680 --> 00:00:20.040
 traces that we have marked with the 

00:00:18.540 --> 00:00:22.170
 dust specks that could have passed 

00:00:20.040 --> 00:00:24.090
 on top of our terminal the second 

00:00:22.170 --> 00:00:27.270
 would be the screen saver that 

00:00:24.090 --> 00:00:29.460
 we can find two types or 

00:00:27.270 --> 00:00:30.990
 an adhesive that goes on a sheet that 

00:00:29.460 --> 00:00:33.330
 it would simply be to remove the adhesive and 

00:00:30.990 --> 00:00:35.310
 place it on top of our terminal or 

00:00:33.330 --> 00:00:38.550
 well those that come protected by two 

00:00:35.310 --> 00:00:40.440
 faces we have two stickers to each 

00:00:38.550 --> 00:00:42.180
 side that tell us what we have to 

00:00:40.440 --> 00:00:44.460
 remove first in this case would be 

00:00:42.180 --> 00:00:47.640
 first remove the one that puts before the 

00:00:44.460 --> 00:00:49.650
 number one we would withdraw it we will give the 

00:00:47.640 --> 00:00:51.900
 back we would place on top of our 

00:00:49.650 --> 00:00:54.270
 terminal and when it was already placed 

00:00:51.900 --> 00:00:56.330
 we would withdraw protection number 2 

00:00:54.270 --> 00:01:01.140
 good if the installation would be done 

00:00:56.330 --> 00:01:03.120
 and finally we need a card that 

00:01:01.140 --> 00:01:05.820
 we can take it anywhere with the 

00:01:03.120 --> 00:01:07.979
 to press the screen of our 

00:01:05.820 --> 00:01:10.720
 terminal go withdrawing the possible 

00:01:07.979 --> 00:01:13.090
 bubbles that have remained 

00:01:10.720 --> 00:01:15.110
 Once the theory is explained, it's time to 

00:01:13.090 --> 00:01:18.530
 move to practice 

00:01:15.110 --> 00:01:20.930
 first we will take the mobile phone and 

00:01:18.530 --> 00:01:22.680
 with the microfiber mop we will clean 

00:01:20.930 --> 00:01:24.570
 the screen 

00:01:22.680 --> 00:01:27.230
 this time there is not a trace left 

00:01:24.570 --> 00:01:27.230
 no speck 

00:01:28.930 --> 00:01:33.670
 then we will take the pro of our 

00:01:31.330 --> 00:01:36.830
 screen protector and we will take it off 

00:01:33.670 --> 00:01:39.700
 Of the surface 

00:01:36.830 --> 00:01:39.700
 so that 

00:01:39.800 --> 00:01:46.090
 to place it on top of our 

00:01:42.050 --> 00:01:46.090
 terminal with extreme care 

00:01:48.580 --> 00:01:55.000
 once placed the bottom 

00:01:50.610 --> 00:01:59.070
 we oppress and we are moving towards 

00:01:55.000 --> 00:02:02.909
 Top carefully 

00:01:59.070 --> 00:02:04.230
 we can help from the card 

00:02:02.909 --> 00:02:08.040
 what 

00:02:04.230 --> 00:02:11.620
 we took the previous time we oppressed and 

00:02:08.040 --> 00:02:14.220
 we accompany the movement 

00:02:11.620 --> 00:02:16.530
 delicately 

00:02:14.220 --> 00:02:20.960
 but security where all security that 

00:02:16.530 --> 00:02:20.960
 If we are not going to stay like a churro 

00:02:24.260 --> 00:02:29.680
 we oppress and try to remove the 

00:02:26.420 --> 00:02:29.680
 possible bubbles that have remained 

00:02:34.090 --> 00:02:38.710
 and it is already 

00:02:35.830 --> 00:02:41.860
 we would have our terminal with the 

00:02:38.710 --> 00:02:44.400
 installed screen saver excuse me 

00:02:41.860 --> 00:02:44.400
 for that movement 

00:02:46.120 --> 00:02:49.890
 we would send you a little over 

00:03:01.319 --> 00:03:05.639
 and we already have our phone with the 

00:03:03.329 --> 00:03:07.379
 screen saver but make 

00:03:05.639 --> 00:03:09.780
 some surgeries in the lower corner 

00:03:07.379 --> 00:03:11.819
 but the important thing is that the 

00:03:09.780 --> 00:03:13.069
 screen thanks to the card is 

00:03:11.819 --> 00:03:15.020
 perfect 

00:03:13.069 --> 00:03:17.980
 a greeting 

00:03:15.020 --> 00:03:17.980
 And until next time
