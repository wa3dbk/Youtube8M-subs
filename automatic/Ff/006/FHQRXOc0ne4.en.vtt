00:00:51.619 --> 00:00:51.629 
ball in early parts of the innings I

00:00:51.629 --> 00:00:53.090 
ball in early parts of the innings I
think<00:00:52.079> there<00:00:52.199> should<00:00:52.350> have<00:00:52.620> been<00:00:52.710> searching

for<00:00:53.129> more<00:00:53.489> wickets

00:00:54.049 --> 00:00:54.059

00:03:33.490 --> 00:03:33.500 
becomes down the order when sometimes

becomes down the order when sometimes
you<00:03:33.860> know<00:03:34.010> he's<00:03:34.160> got<00:03:34.370> a<00:03:34.400> pretty<00:03:35.209> good<00:03:35.299> idea

00:03:35.500 --> 00:03:35.510 
you know he's got a pretty good idea

00:03:35.510 --> 00:03:37.420 
you know he's got a pretty good idea
what<00:03:35.840> the<00:03:35.870> pitch<00:03:36.140> is<00:03:36.170> doing<00:03:36.500> what<00:03:36.680> the<00:03:36.890> bolas

00:03:37.420 --> 00:03:37.430 
what the pitch is doing what the bolas

00:03:37.430 --> 00:03:40.900 
what the pitch is doing what the bolas
are<00:03:37.610> doing<00:03:38.890> Gail<00:03:39.890> does<00:03:40.130> it<00:03:40.280> at<00:03:40.400> the<00:03:40.489> top<00:03:40.670> of<00:03:40.790> the

00:03:40.900 --> 00:03:40.910 
are doing Gail does it at the top of the

00:03:40.910 --> 00:03:43.270 
are doing Gail does it at the top of the
order<00:03:41.060> so<00:03:41.390> for<00:03:41.660> me<00:03:41.780> I<00:03:41.810> think<00:03:42.170> he's<00:03:42.860> just<00:03:43.100> that

00:03:43.270 --> 00:03:43.280 
order so for me I think he's just that

00:03:43.280 --> 00:03:45.009 
order so for me I think he's just that
little<00:03:43.430> bit<00:03:43.610> better<00:03:43.730> not<00:03:44.090> much<00:03:44.299> to<00:03:44.450> choose<00:03:44.600> not

00:03:45.009 --> 00:03:45.019 
little bit better not much to choose not

00:03:45.019 --> 00:03:47.199 
little bit better not much to choose not
much<00:03:45.230> to<00:03:45.380> choose<00:03:45.489> but<00:03:46.489> I<00:03:46.519> would<00:03:46.790> imagine<00:03:46.970> in

00:03:47.199 --> 00:03:47.209 
much to choose but I would imagine in

00:03:47.209 --> 00:03:49.390 
much to choose but I would imagine in
terms<00:03:47.239> of<00:03:47.600> sheer<00:03:47.840> power<00:03:48.140> I<00:03:48.440> think<00:03:49.040> it's<00:03:49.160> got<00:03:49.310> to

00:03:49.390 --> 00:03:49.400 
terms of sheer power I think it's got to

00:03:49.400 --> 00:03:50.830 
terms of sheer power I think it's got to
be<00:03:49.459> Chris<00:03:49.640> Gayle<00:03:49.880> okay<00:03:50.299> Brian<00:03:50.540> the<00:03:50.690> same

00:03:50.830 --> 00:03:50.840 
be Chris Gayle okay Brian the same

00:03:50.840 --> 00:03:52.270 
be Chris Gayle okay Brian the same

attack<00:04:08.000> I<00:04:08.150> think<00:04:08.570> EB<00:04:08.810> the<00:04:08.900> village<00:04:09.170> is<00:04:09.320> the<00:04:09.440> one

00:04:09.610 --> 00:04:09.620 
attack I think EB the village is the one

00:04:09.620 --> 00:04:12.220 
attack I think EB the village is the one
who<00:04:09.799> is<00:04:09.920> going<00:04:10.100> to<00:04:10.220> be<00:04:10.340> versatile<00:04:11.299> and<00:04:11.630> I<00:04:11.989> think

00:04:12.220 --> 00:04:12.230 
who is going to be versatile and I think

00:04:12.230 --> 00:04:13.030 
who is going to be versatile and I think
the<00:04:12.290> one<00:04:12.440> who's<00:04:12.590> going<00:04:12.680> to<00:04:12.739> be<00:04:12.860> more

00:04:13.030 --> 00:04:13.040 
the one who's going to be more

00:04:13.040 --> 00:04:15.670 
the one who's going to be more
consistent<00:04:13.519> Chris<00:04:13.970> Gayle<00:04:14.269> big<00:04:15.050> powerful

00:04:15.670 --> 00:04:15.680 
consistent Chris Gayle big powerful

00:04:15.680 --> 00:04:19.009 
consistent Chris Gayle big powerful
hitter<00:04:15.890> but<00:04:16.580> I<00:04:16.609> think<00:04:16.910> is<00:04:17.030> inconsistency<00:04:17.870> is

00:04:19.009 --> 00:04:19.019 
hitter but I think is inconsistency is
