sewer<00:00:35.809> check<00:00:36.809> this<00:00:36.960> one<00:00:37.140> out<00:00:41.480> and<00:00:44.180> it<00:00:45.180> looks

00:00:45.380 --> 00:00:45.390 
sewer check this one out and it looks

00:00:45.390 --> 00:00:48.619 
sewer check this one out and it looks
like<00:00:45.570> it's<00:00:46.789> got<00:00:47.789> wood<00:00:48.030> in<00:00:48.180> there<00:00:48.360> it<00:00:48.450> looks

00:00:48.619 --> 00:00:48.629 
like it's got wood in there it looks

00:00:48.629 --> 00:00:50.260 
like it's got wood in there it looks
like<00:00:48.750> it's<00:00:48.870> blocked<00:00:49.140> off<00:00:49.350> pretty<00:00:49.620> good<00:00:49.739> I

00:00:50.260 --> 00:00:50.270 
like it's blocked off pretty good I

00:00:50.270 --> 00:00:52.459 
like it's blocked off pretty good I
don't<00:00:51.270> know<00:00:51.390> how<00:00:51.480> far<00:00:51.719> that<00:00:51.750> booty<00:00:52.079> was<00:00:52.260> done

00:00:52.459 --> 00:00:52.469 
don't know how far that booty was done

00:00:52.469 --> 00:00:54.220 
don't know how far that booty was done
when<00:00:52.590> I<00:00:52.649> imagine<00:00:53.160> it<00:00:53.250> goes<00:00:53.430> down<00:00:53.550> all<00:00:53.789> the<00:00:53.879> way

00:00:54.220 --> 00:00:54.230 
when I imagine it goes down all the way

00:00:54.230 --> 00:01:01.490 
when I imagine it goes down all the way
so<00:00:55.230> that<00:00:55.260> looks<00:00:55.530> pretty<00:00:55.590> good<00:01:00.320> through<00:01:01.320> the

00:01:01.490 --> 00:01:01.500 
so that looks pretty good through the

00:01:01.500 --> 00:01:05.220 
so that looks pretty good through the
second<00:01:01.859> one<00:01:02.030> check<00:01:03.030> that<00:01:03.239> out

00:01:05.220 --> 00:01:05.230 
second one check that out

00:01:05.230 --> 00:01:09.900 
second one check that out
yeah<00:01:05.860> so<00:01:06.100> the<00:01:06.430> storm<00:01:06.700> sewers<00:01:07.180> and<00:01:08.220> the<00:01:09.220> little

00:01:09.900 --> 00:01:09.910 
yeah so the storm sewers and the little

00:01:09.910 --> 00:01:13.250 
yeah so the storm sewers and the little
drainage<00:01:10.240> pipes<00:01:11.250> there's<00:01:12.250> four<00:01:12.790> all<00:01:12.970> together

00:01:13.250 --> 00:01:13.260 
drainage pipes there's four all together

00:01:13.260 --> 00:01:15.750 
drainage pipes there's four all together
and<00:01:14.260> I'm<00:01:14.410> pretty<00:01:14.770> sure<00:01:14.980> they<00:01:15.190> all<00:01:15.310> lead<00:01:15.550> down

00:01:15.750 --> 00:01:15.760 
and I'm pretty sure they all lead down

00:01:15.760 --> 00:01:21.900 
and I'm pretty sure they all lead down
to<00:01:15.790> the<00:01:16.000> Fraser<00:01:16.300> River<00:01:17.070> and<00:01:18.070> the<00:01:20.400> the<00:01:21.400> parks

00:01:21.900 --> 00:01:21.910 
to the Fraser River and the the parks

00:01:21.910 --> 00:01:25.320 
to the Fraser River and the the parks
staff<00:01:22.660> was<00:01:22.990> supposed<00:01:23.230> to<00:01:23.380> block<00:01:23.910> any<00:01:24.910> way<00:01:25.300> out

00:01:25.320 --> 00:01:25.330 
staff was supposed to block any way out

00:01:25.330 --> 00:01:38.280 
staff was supposed to block any way out
for<00:01:25.780> the<00:01:26.110> snakehead<00:01:27.270> here's<00:01:28.270> the<00:01:28.360> second<00:01:28.840> one

00:01:38.280 --> 00:01:38.290 

00:01:38.290 --> 00:01:42.710 

here

00:01:42.710 --> 00:01:42.720 

00:01:42.720 --> 00:01:44.810 

and

00:01:44.810 --> 00:01:44.820 
and

00:01:44.820 --> 00:01:48.280 
and
this<00:01:45.360> one<00:01:45.570> doesn't<00:01:45.780> look<00:01:46.050> too<00:01:46.230> good<00:01:46.409> because

00:01:48.280 --> 00:01:48.290 
this one doesn't look too good because

00:01:48.290 --> 00:02:05.270 
this one doesn't look too good because
two<00:01:49.290> inch<00:01:49.470> squares<00:01:52.130> pick<00:01:53.130> you<00:01:53.310> up

00:02:05.270 --> 00:02:05.280 

00:02:05.280 --> 00:02:08.940 

that<00:02:06.280> 18<00:02:07.120> inch<00:02:07.300> chest<00:02:07.540> naked<00:02:07.990> probably

00:02:08.940 --> 00:02:08.950 
that 18 inch chest naked probably

00:02:08.950 --> 00:02:10.200 
that 18 inch chest naked probably
couldn't<00:02:09.220> get<00:02:09.340> through<00:02:09.550> there<00:02:09.700> but<00:02:09.729> anything

00:02:10.200 --> 00:02:10.210 
couldn't get through there but anything

00:02:10.210 --> 00:02:11.940 
couldn't get through there but anything
smaller<00:02:10.540> could<00:02:10.900> get<00:02:11.050> through<00:02:11.200> there<00:02:11.410> so<00:02:11.620> that

00:02:11.940 --> 00:02:11.950 
smaller could get through there so that

00:02:11.950 --> 00:02:15.570 
smaller could get through there so that
was<00:02:12.760> not<00:02:12.940> very<00:02:13.120> good<00:02:13.830> and<00:02:14.830> we'll<00:02:15.010> go<00:02:15.160> check<00:02:15.400> out

00:02:15.570 --> 00:02:15.580 
was not very good and we'll go check out

00:02:15.580 --> 00:02:18.330 
was not very good and we'll go check out
the<00:02:16.380> little<00:02:17.380> stream<00:02:17.620> that<00:02:17.770> runs<00:02:17.950> out<00:02:18.160> of<00:02:18.190> the

00:02:18.330 --> 00:02:18.340

00:03:00.580 --> 00:03:08.010 

hey<00:03:01.150> so<00:03:01.210> a<00:03:01.840> stream<00:03:02.800> is<00:03:02.980> just<00:03:03.190> over<00:03:03.460> here

00:03:08.010 --> 00:03:08.020 

00:03:08.020 --> 00:03:09.990 

will<00:03:08.560> check<00:03:08.890> to<00:03:09.010> see<00:03:09.040> what<00:03:09.310> kind<00:03:09.490> of<00:03:09.580> blockage

00:03:09.990 --> 00:03:10.000 
will check to see what kind of blockage

00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:23.600 
will check to see what kind of blockage
they<00:03:10.210> got<00:03:10.360> here<00:03:10.570> for<00:03:10.840> the<00:03:11.020> snake

00:03:23.600 --> 00:03:23.610 

00:03:23.610 --> 00:03:30.060 

so<00:03:24.610> they've<00:03:24.940> got<00:03:25.150> a<00:03:25.180> screen<00:03:25.600> up<00:03:25.750> here<00:03:26.880> and<00:03:29.070> it

00:03:30.060 --> 00:03:30.070 
so they've got a screen up here and it

00:03:30.070 --> 00:03:32.550 
so they've got a screen up here and it
looks<00:03:30.670> like<00:03:30.760> a<00:03:30.880> good<00:03:31.090> block<00:03:31.270> almost<00:03:32.260> anything

00:03:32.550 --> 00:03:32.560 
looks like a good block almost anything

00:03:32.560 --> 00:03:36.210 
looks like a good block almost anything
and<00:03:33.180> the<00:03:34.180> holes<00:03:34.390> are<00:03:34.600> really<00:03:34.870> small<00:03:35.110> so<00:03:35.220> small

00:03:36.210 --> 00:03:36.220 
and the holes are really small so small

00:03:36.220 --> 00:03:37.470 
and the holes are really small so small
the<00:03:36.430> fish<00:03:36.610> can't<00:03:36.850> get<00:03:37.000> through<00:03:37.180> there<00:03:37.300> either

00:03:37.470 --> 00:03:37.480 
the fish can't get through there either

00:03:37.480 --> 00:03:40.920 
the fish can't get through there either
so<00:03:38.010> if<00:03:39.010> the<00:03:39.130> snakehead<00:03:39.670> really<00:03:40.180> wanted<00:03:40.630> to<00:03:40.780> it

00:03:40.920 --> 00:03:40.930 
so if the snakehead really wanted to it

00:03:40.930 --> 00:03:44.610 
so if the snakehead really wanted to it
could<00:03:41.490> go<00:03:42.490> on<00:03:42.550> land<00:03:42.820> here<00:03:43.180> go<00:03:43.690> up<00:03:43.870> and<00:03:44.050> over

00:03:44.610 --> 00:03:44.620 
could go on land here go up and over

00:03:44.620 --> 00:03:47.760 
could go on land here go up and over
into<00:03:44.890> the<00:03:45.010> stream<00:03:45.840> yeah<00:03:46.840> they're<00:03:47.230> they're

00:03:47.760 --> 00:03:47.770 
into the stream yeah they're they're

00:03:47.770 --> 00:03:52.170 
into the stream yeah they're they're
definitely<00:03:50.550> doing<00:03:51.550> something<00:03:51.580> with<00:03:51.880> the<00:03:52.000> pond

00:03:52.170 --> 00:03:52.180 
definitely doing something with the pond

00:03:52.180 --> 00:03:53.790 
definitely doing something with the pond
because<00:03:52.420> normally<00:03:53.020> the<00:03:53.200> water<00:03:53.440> is<00:03:53.590> flowing

00:03:53.790 --> 00:03:53.800 
because normally the water is flowing

00:03:53.800 --> 00:03:57.510 
because normally the water is flowing
over<00:03:54.250> here<00:03:55.410> so<00:03:56.410> I'm<00:03:56.710> going<00:03:56.830> to<00:03:56.860> do<00:03:57.340> a<00:03:57.370> little

00:03:57.510 --> 00:03:57.520 
over here so I'm going to do a little

00:03:57.520 --> 00:04:00.180 
over here so I'm going to do a little
bit<00:03:57.640> more<00:03:57.730> investigation<00:03:58.800> because<00:03:59.800> they<00:04:00.040> are

00:04:00.180 --> 00:04:00.190 
bit more investigation because they are

00:04:00.190 --> 00:04:03.510 
bit more investigation because they are
draining<00:04:00.520> the<00:04:00.730> pond<00:04:00.970> it<00:04:01.120> looks<00:04:01.330> like<00:04:01.540> so<00:04:02.520> maybe

00:04:03.510 --> 00:04:03.520 
draining the pond it looks like so maybe

00:04:03.520 --> 00:04:05.270 
draining the pond it looks like so maybe
they're<00:04:03.790> going<00:04:03.940> to<00:04:04.030> get<00:04:04.180> low<00:04:04.720> enough<00:04:04.750> for

00:04:05.270 --> 00:04:05.280 
they're going to get low enough for

00:04:05.280 --> 00:04:08.850 
they're going to get low enough for
tomorrow<00:04:06.280> to<00:04:06.370> do<00:04:06.700> something<00:04:07.560> and<00:04:08.560> I'm<00:04:08.740> going

00:04:08.850 --> 00:04:08.860 
tomorrow to do something and I'm going

00:04:08.860 --> 00:04:10.830 
tomorrow to do something and I'm going
to<00:04:08.890> go<00:04:09.040> over<00:04:09.070> and<00:04:09.400> check<00:04:09.459> to<00:04:09.700> see<00:04:09.880> if<00:04:10.060> I<00:04:10.390> can<00:04:10.690> see

00:04:10.830 --> 00:04:10.840 
to go over and check to see if I can see

00:04:10.840 --> 00:04:15.150 
to go over and check to see if I can see
the<00:04:10.930> snakehead<00:04:12.630> okay<00:04:13.630> so<00:04:13.690> let's<00:04:14.050> go<00:04:14.620> down<00:04:14.860> and

00:04:15.150 --> 00:04:15.160 
the snakehead okay so let's go down and

00:04:15.160 --> 00:04:18.750 
the snakehead okay so let's go down and
check<00:04:15.610> out<00:04:16.390> the<00:04:16.540> two<00:04:16.780> drainage<00:04:17.470> pipes<00:04:17.769> down<00:04:18.519> at

00:04:18.750 --> 00:04:18.760 
check out the two drainage pipes down at

00:04:18.760 --> 00:04:20.580 
check out the two drainage pipes down at
the<00:04:18.880> smaller<00:04:19.120> pond<00:04:19.450> here<00:04:19.720> see<00:04:20.320> if<00:04:20.350> they're

00:04:20.580 --> 00:04:20.590 
the smaller pond here see if they're

00:04:20.590 --> 00:04:25.080 
the smaller pond here see if they're
blocked<00:04:20.920> off<00:04:22.470> okay<00:04:23.470> here's<00:04:23.710> the<00:04:23.800> last<00:04:24.669> pond

00:04:25.080 --> 00:04:25.090 
blocked off okay here's the last pond

00:04:25.090 --> 00:04:28.650 
blocked off okay here's the last pond
before<00:04:25.840> it<00:04:26.230> drains<00:04:26.830> down<00:04:27.190> into<00:04:27.250> the<00:04:28.120> pipes<00:04:28.360> and

00:04:28.650 --> 00:04:28.660 
before it drains down into the pipes and

00:04:28.660 --> 00:04:30.780 
before it drains down into the pipes and
then<00:04:29.380> eventually<00:04:29.530> makes<00:04:30.250> its<00:04:30.370> way<00:04:30.580> to<00:04:30.610> the

00:04:30.780 --> 00:04:30.790 
then eventually makes its way to the

00:04:30.790 --> 00:04:35.670 
then eventually makes its way to the
Fraser<00:04:31.090> River<00:04:33.180> there's<00:04:34.180> two<00:04:34.419> pipes<00:04:35.410> here

00:04:35.670 --> 00:04:35.680 
Fraser River there's two pipes here

00:04:35.680 --> 00:04:41.390 
Fraser River there's two pipes here
there's<00:04:36.280> one

00:04:41.390 --> 00:04:41.400 

00:04:41.400 --> 00:04:45.920 

somewhat<00:04:43.190> blocked<00:04:44.190> off<00:04:44.460> but<00:04:44.880> no<00:04:45.600> holes<00:04:45.780> are

00:04:45.920 --> 00:04:45.930 
somewhat blocked off but no holes are

00:04:45.930 --> 00:04:47.090 
somewhat blocked off but no holes are
big<00:04:46.050> enough<00:04:46.139> for<00:04:46.440> a<00:04:46.470> snakehead<00:04:46.740> to<00:04:46.979> get

00:04:47.090 --> 00:04:47.100 
big enough for a snakehead to get

00:04:47.100 --> 00:04:50.950 
big enough for a snakehead to get
through

00:04:50.950 --> 00:04:50.960 

00:04:50.960 --> 00:04:57.400 

and<00:04:51.960> here's<00:04:52.950> the<00:04:53.190> other<00:04:53.250> pipe<00:04:53.640> over<00:04:53.940> here

00:04:57.400 --> 00:04:57.410 

00:04:57.410 --> 00:05:05.350 

that's<00:04:58.410> just<00:04:58.740> up<00:05:00.110> it's<00:05:01.110> just<00:05:01.350> an<00:05:01.470> open<00:05:01.800> pipe

00:05:05.350 --> 00:05:05.360 

00:05:05.360 --> 00:05:10.159 

see<00:05:06.360> that

00:05:10.159 --> 00:05:10.169 

00:05:10.169 --> 00:05:14.059 

there<00:05:10.889> it's<00:05:11.009> just<00:05:11.129> an<00:05:11.310> open<00:05:11.610> pipe<00:05:12.259> what<00:05:13.259> the

00:05:14.059 --> 00:05:14.069 
there it's just an open pipe what the

00:05:14.069 --> 00:05:15.439 
there it's just an open pipe what the
snakehead<00:05:14.460> makes<00:05:14.669> it<00:05:14.789> down<00:05:14.909> to<00:05:15.029> this<00:05:15.120> bond

00:05:15.439 --> 00:05:15.449 
snakehead makes it down to this bond

00:05:15.449 --> 00:05:19.899 
snakehead makes it down to this bond
through<00:05:16.349> the<00:05:16.529> pipe<00:05:16.710> and<00:05:16.979> to<00:05:17.430> the<00:05:17.580> Fraser<00:05:17.819> River

00:05:19.899 --> 00:05:19.909 
through the pipe and to the Fraser River

00:05:19.909 --> 00:05:23.300 
through the pipe and to the Fraser River
the<00:05:20.909> officials<00:05:21.620> should<00:05:22.620> be<00:05:22.800> blocking<00:05:23.069> that

00:05:23.300 --> 00:05:23.310 
the officials should be blocking that

00:05:23.310 --> 00:05:27.890 
the officials should be blocking that
off<00:05:25.249> we're<00:05:26.249> going<00:05:26.370> to<00:05:26.430> see<00:05:26.580> if<00:05:26.729> the<00:05:26.999> snakeheads

00:05:27.890 --> 00:05:27.900 
off we're going to see if the snakeheads

00:05:27.900 --> 00:05:35.360 
off we're going to see if the snakeheads
here<00:05:32.360> it's<00:05:33.360> going<00:05:33.479> to<00:05:33.569> be<00:05:33.629> hard<00:05:33.810> too<00:05:33.960> hard<00:05:34.370> to

00:05:35.360 --> 00:05:35.370 
here it's going to be hard too hard to

00:05:35.370 --> 00:05:39.170 
here it's going to be hard too hard to
see<00:05:35.580> it<00:05:35.699> because<00:05:37.279> it's<00:05:38.279> later<00:05:38.490> in<00:05:38.729> the<00:05:38.909> day

00:05:39.170 --> 00:05:39.180 
see it because it's later in the day

00:05:39.180 --> 00:05:42.829 
see it because it's later in the day
it's<00:05:39.840> kind<00:05:39.990> of<00:05:40.110> dark<00:05:40.319> right<00:05:40.650> now<00:05:41.479> you<00:05:42.479> don't

00:05:42.829 --> 00:05:42.839 
it's kind of dark right now you don't

00:05:42.839 --> 00:06:04.450 
it's kind of dark right now you don't
see<00:05:43.169> it

00:06:04.450 --> 00:06:04.460 

00:06:04.460 --> 00:06:07.900 

by<00:06:05.030> draining<00:06:05.360> the<00:06:05.600> pond<00:06:05.870> to<00:06:06.080> the<00:06:06.910> snakeheads

00:06:07.900 --> 00:06:07.910 
by draining the pond to the snakeheads

00:06:07.910 --> 00:06:10.180 
by draining the pond to the snakeheads
going<00:06:08.150> to<00:06:08.210> move<00:06:08.389> from<00:06:08.600> its<00:06:08.840> spot<00:06:09.470> because<00:06:09.979> it

00:06:10.180 --> 00:06:10.190 
going to move from its spot because it

00:06:10.190 --> 00:06:13.480 
going to move from its spot because it
likes<00:06:10.400> to<00:06:10.520> on<00:06:10.910> the<00:06:11.330> bank<00:06:11.569> here<00:06:12.250> so<00:06:13.250> it's<00:06:13.370> going

00:06:13.480 --> 00:06:13.490 
likes to on the bank here so it's going

00:06:13.490 --> 00:06:18.580 
likes to on the bank here so it's going
to<00:06:13.610> move<00:06:13.789> somewhere<00:06:14.210> else<00:06:17.289> she's<00:06:18.289> gonna<00:06:18.470> be

00:06:18.580 --> 00:06:18.590 
to move somewhere else she's gonna be

00:06:18.590 --> 00:06:31.500 
to move somewhere else she's gonna be
harder<00:06:18.919> for<00:06:18.949> them<00:06:19.190> to<00:06:19.250> catch

00:06:31.500 --> 00:06:31.510 

00:06:31.510 --> 00:06:37.610 

no<00:06:32.140> oh<00:06:32.670> well<00:06:33.670> look<00:06:33.790> what<00:06:33.940> I<00:06:34.000> see<00:06:34.210> here

00:06:37.610 --> 00:06:37.620 

00:06:37.620 --> 00:06:42.000 

to<00:06:38.620> bullfrog<00:06:39.100> I<00:06:39.660> haven't<00:06:40.660> seen<00:06:41.320> a<00:06:41.350> bullfrog<00:06:41.830> up

00:06:42.000 --> 00:06:42.010 
to bullfrog I haven't seen a bullfrog up

00:06:42.010 --> 00:06:46.290 
to bullfrog I haven't seen a bullfrog up
in<00:06:42.220> the<00:06:43.150> pond<00:06:43.390> here<00:06:43.600> for<00:06:43.780> a<00:06:43.810> while<00:06:44.020> I<00:06:45.300> guess

00:06:46.290 --> 00:06:46.300 
in the pond here for a while I guess

00:06:46.300 --> 00:06:48.900 
in the pond here for a while I guess
with<00:06:46.540> the<00:06:46.870> water<00:06:47.170> going<00:06:47.440> down<00:06:47.910> administer

00:06:48.900 --> 00:06:48.910 
with the water going down administer

00:06:48.910 --> 00:06:52.610 
with the water going down administer
seeing<00:06:49.210> a<00:06:49.270> whole<00:06:49.330> bunch<00:06:49.390> of<00:06:49.720> different<00:06:49.960> things

00:06:52.610 --> 00:06:52.620 

00:06:52.620 --> 00:06:57.900 

it's<00:06:53.620> pretty<00:06:53.890> big

00:06:57.900 --> 00:06:57.910 

00:06:57.910 --> 00:07:00.490 

here's<00:06:58.910> the<00:06:59.000> here's<00:06:59.600> the<00:06:59.780> little<00:06:59.930> pond<00:07:00.170> off<00:07:00.350> to

00:07:00.490 --> 00:07:00.500 
here's the here's the little pond off to
