posture I think you're talking about not
so<00:02:29.130> much<00:02:29.280> for<00:02:29.459> the<00:02:29.550> hand<00:02:29.730> position<00:02:30.180> or<00:02:30.300> about

00:02:30.470 --> 00:02:30.480 
so much for the hand position or about

00:02:30.480 --> 00:02:33.140 
so much for the hand position or about
how<00:02:30.630> your<00:02:30.780> back<00:02:30.959> is<00:02:31.250> to<00:02:32.250> me<00:02:32.400> I<00:02:32.430> tell<00:02:32.940> my

00:02:33.140 --> 00:02:33.150 
how your back is to me I tell my

00:02:33.150 --> 00:02:36.140 
how your back is to me I tell my
students<00:02:33.840> in<00:02:34.020> class<00:02:34.050> that<00:02:34.950> they<00:02:35.489> can<00:02:35.700> allow

00:02:36.140 --> 00:02:36.150 
students in class that they can allow

00:02:36.150 --> 00:02:37.940 
students in class that they can allow
their<00:02:36.420> shoulders<00:02:36.840> to<00:02:36.870> roll<00:02:37.260> forward<00:02:37.560> a<00:02:37.709> little

00:02:37.940 --> 00:02:37.950 
their shoulders to roll forward a little

00:02:37.950 --> 00:02:39.680 
their shoulders to roll forward a little
bit<00:02:38.070> because<00:02:38.220> that's<00:02:38.580> natural<00:02:39.120> and<00:02:39.209> does<00:02:39.450> help

00:02:39.680 --> 00:02:39.690 
bit because that's natural and does help

00:02:39.690 --> 00:02:41.540 
bit because that's natural and does help
keep<00:02:39.900> the<00:02:40.050> back<00:02:40.230> relaxed<00:02:40.620> as<00:02:41.040> long<00:02:41.280> as<00:02:41.430> the

00:02:41.540 --> 00:02:41.550 
keep the back relaxed as long as the

00:02:41.550 --> 00:02:43.280 
keep the back relaxed as long as the
shoulder<00:02:41.880> blades<00:02:42.180> are<00:02:42.450> sunk<00:02:42.750> in<00:02:42.900> the<00:02:43.110> back

00:02:43.280 --> 00:02:43.290 
shoulder blades are sunk in the back

00:02:43.290 --> 00:02:45.380 
shoulder blades are sunk in the back
pockets<00:02:43.830> that's<00:02:44.100> my<00:02:44.340> analogy<00:02:44.550> okay<00:02:45.120> so<00:02:45.180> you

00:02:45.380 --> 00:02:45.390 
pockets that's my analogy okay so you

00:02:45.390 --> 00:02:46.940 
pockets that's my analogy okay so you
keep<00:02:45.600> those<00:02:45.810> shoulder<00:02:46.170> blades<00:02:46.200> down<00:02:46.680> and<00:02:46.739> back

00:02:46.940 --> 00:02:46.950 
keep those shoulder blades down and back

00:02:46.950 --> 00:02:49.070 
keep those shoulder blades down and back
but<00:02:47.700> it's<00:02:47.880> okay<00:02:48.150> to<00:02:48.239> let<00:02:48.360> the<00:02:48.420> shoulders<00:02:48.540> roll

00:02:49.070 --> 00:02:49.080 
but it's okay to let the shoulders roll

00:02:49.080 --> 00:02:51.530 
but it's okay to let the shoulders roll
forward<00:02:49.110> a<00:02:49.500> bit<00:02:49.650> a<00:02:49.950> little<00:02:50.370> bit<00:02:50.519> elbows<00:02:51.360> are

00:02:51.530 --> 00:02:51.540 
forward a bit a little bit elbows are

00:02:51.540 --> 00:02:53.990 
forward a bit a little bit elbows are
always<00:02:51.810> soft<00:02:52.050> right<00:02:52.320> and<00:02:53.160> then<00:02:53.340> as<00:02:53.519> far<00:02:53.700> as<00:02:53.760> it

00:02:53.990 --> 00:02:54.000 
always soft right and then as far as it

00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:56.690 
always soft right and then as far as it
sounds<00:02:54.330> like<00:02:54.480> when<00:02:54.870> you're<00:02:55.019> seated<00:02:55.340> Joan<00:02:56.340> and

00:02:56.690 --> 00:02:56.700 
sounds like when you're seated Joan and

00:02:56.700 --> 00:02:57.949 
sounds like when you're seated Joan and
everybody<00:02:57.060> else<00:02:57.209> out<00:02:57.420> there<00:02:57.450> you<00:02:57.870> should

00:04:01.460 --> 00:04:01.470 
flat in this case I'm somewhere kind of

00:04:01.470 --> 00:04:04.280 
flat in this case I'm somewhere kind of
between<00:04:01.829> my<00:04:02.340> buns<00:04:02.519> are<00:04:02.730> kind<00:04:02.940> of<00:04:03.030> between<00:04:03.329> well

00:04:04.280 --> 00:04:04.290 
between my buns are kind of between well

between my buns are kind of between well
they're<00:04:04.440> really<00:04:04.620> over<00:04:04.769> the<00:04:04.859> back<00:04:05.010> of<00:04:05.160> the<00:04:05.220> seat

they're really over the back of the seat

00:04:05.400 --> 00:04:06.620 
they're really over the back of the seat
but<00:04:05.519> they<00:04:05.640> can<00:04:05.790> go<00:04:05.940> a<00:04:05.970> little<00:04:06.180> bit<00:04:06.329> more

00:04:06.620 --> 00:04:06.630 
but they can go a little bit more

00:04:06.630 --> 00:04:09.500 
but they can go a little bit more
towards<00:04:07.230> the<00:04:07.320> center<00:04:07.620> if<00:04:07.709> you<00:04:07.769> like<00:04:08.510> when

00:04:09.500 --> 00:04:09.510 
towards the center if you like when

00:04:09.510 --> 00:04:10.970 
towards the center if you like when
you're<00:04:09.630> standing<00:04:09.930> also<00:04:10.440> I'll<00:04:10.650> tell<00:04:10.860> my

00:04:10.970 --> 00:04:10.980 
you're standing also I'll tell my

00:04:10.980 --> 00:04:12.979 
you're standing also I'll tell my
students<00:04:11.370> pretend<00:04:12.150> your<00:04:12.269> hips<00:04:12.510> are<00:04:12.660> a<00:04:12.690> bucket

00:04:12.979 --> 00:04:12.989 
students pretend your hips are a bucket

00:04:12.989 --> 00:04:15.170 
students pretend your hips are a bucket
of<00:04:13.080> water<00:04:13.260> and<00:04:13.530> the<00:04:13.950> idea<00:04:14.310> is<00:04:14.400> to<00:04:14.610> not<00:04:14.819> spill

00:04:15.170 --> 00:04:15.180 
of water and the idea is to not spill

00:04:15.180 --> 00:04:17.210 
of water and the idea is to not spill
that<00:04:15.390> water<00:04:15.660> so<00:04:16.229> you'll<00:04:16.709> hear<00:04:16.859> me<00:04:17.010> use<00:04:17.130> that

00:04:17.210 --> 00:04:17.220 
that water so you'll hear me use that

00:04:17.220 --> 00:04:18.800 
that water so you'll hear me use that
analogy<00:04:17.789> Brooke<00:04:18.060> do<00:04:18.180> you<00:04:18.269> have<00:04:18.359> anything<00:04:18.539> that

00:04:18.800 --> 00:04:18.810 
analogy Brooke do you have anything that

00:04:18.810 --> 00:04:21.259 
analogy Brooke do you have anything that
you<00:04:18.930> um<00:04:19.169> well<00:04:20.160> I<00:04:20.190> usually<00:04:20.489> yeah<00:04:20.760> just<00:04:21.000> like

00:04:21.259 --> 00:04:21.269 
you um well I usually yeah just like

00:04:21.269 --> 00:04:23.029 
you um well I usually yeah just like
send<00:04:21.570> the<00:04:21.690> hips<00:04:21.840> back<00:04:22.049> and<00:04:22.560> they<00:04:22.650> say<00:04:22.800> if<00:04:22.919> that

00:04:23.029 --> 00:04:23.039 
send the hips back and they say if that

00:04:23.039 --> 00:04:24.800 
send the hips back and they say if that
starts<00:04:23.310> to<00:04:23.430> bother<00:04:23.669> your<00:04:24.030> back<00:04:24.240> then<00:04:24.630> just

00:04:24.800 --> 00:04:24.810 
starts to bother your back then just

00:04:24.810 --> 00:04:27.200 
starts to bother your back then just
modify<00:04:25.380> it<00:04:25.440> by<00:04:25.680> taking<00:04:25.860> it<00:04:26.130> forward<00:04:26.430> like<00:04:26.580> in

00:04:27.200 --> 00:04:27.210 
modify it by taking it forward like in

00:04:27.210 --> 00:04:28.909 
modify it by taking it forward like in
position<00:04:27.810> three<00:04:28.080> like<00:04:28.289> standing<00:04:28.620> client

00:04:28.909 --> 00:04:28.919 
position three like standing client

00:04:28.919 --> 00:04:30.529 
position three like standing client
position<00:04:29.310> or<00:04:29.460> just<00:04:29.669> drop<00:04:29.789> it<00:04:30.000> David<00:04:30.300> you<00:04:30.419> don't

00:04:30.529 --> 00:04:30.539

00:04:30.539 --> 00:04:33.860 
position or just drop it David you don't
have<00:04:30.780> to<00:04:30.900> hover<00:04:31.580> yeah<00:04:32.580> I<00:04:32.909> call<00:04:33.270> it<00:04:33.300> a<00:04:33.419> drawback

00:04:33.860 --> 00:04:33.870 
have to hover yeah I call it a drawback

00:04:33.870 --> 00:04:35.420 
have to hover yeah I call it a drawback
just<00:04:34.169> because<00:04:34.409> that<00:04:34.530> word<00:04:34.710> hover<00:04:34.979> is<00:04:35.220> so

00:04:35.420 --> 00:04:35.430 
just because that word hover is so

00:04:35.430 --> 00:04:37.219 
just because that word hover is so
controversial<00:04:35.940> everything<00:04:36.630> it<00:04:36.810> does<00:04:36.990> hit<00:04:37.200> the

00:04:37.219 --> 00:04:37.229 
controversial everything it does hit the

00:04:37.229 --> 00:04:38.719 
controversial everything it does hit the

00:04:40.710 --> 00:04:43.130 
but if you have any lower back problems
you<00:04:41.130> should<00:04:41.159> probably<00:04:42.000> take<00:04:42.479> that<00:04:42.659> drawback

00:04:43.130 --> 00:04:43.140 
you should probably take that drawback

00:04:43.140 --> 00:04:44.750 
you should probably take that drawback

just a little bit personally and so if
we're<00:04:57.000> doing<00:04:57.150> jumps<00:04:57.659> I<00:04:57.900> actually<00:04:58.650> do<00:04:59.159> kind<00:04:59.490> of

00:04:59.510 --> 00:04:59.520 
we're doing jumps I actually do kind of

00:04:59.520 --> 00:05:01.640 
we're doing jumps I actually do kind of
let<00:04:59.640> my<00:04:59.760> hand<00:05:00.030> slide<00:05:00.360> back<00:05:00.630> and<00:05:00.810> forth<00:05:00.930> as<00:05:01.470> I'm

00:05:01.640 --> 00:05:01.650 
let my hand slide back and forth as I'm

00:05:01.650 --> 00:05:03.830 
let my hand slide back and forth as I'm
going<00:05:01.860> up<00:05:02.039> and<00:05:02.250> down<00:05:02.490> I<00:05:02.729> might<00:05:03.150> even<00:05:03.330> keep<00:05:03.599> them

00:05:03.830 --> 00:05:03.840 
going up and down I might even keep them

00:05:03.840 --> 00:05:07.010 
going up and down I might even keep them
like<00:05:04.380> in<00:05:04.590> between<00:05:04.710> two<00:05:05.310> and<00:05:05.460> three<00:05:05.840> but<00:05:06.840> that's

00:05:07.010 --> 00:05:07.020 
like in between two and three but that's

00:05:07.020 --> 00:05:08.690 
like in between two and three but that's
again<00:05:07.380> it's<00:05:07.530> gonna<00:05:07.620> be<00:05:07.800> personal<00:05:08.250> preference

00:05:08.690 --> 00:05:08.700 
again it's gonna be personal preference

00:05:08.700 --> 00:05:10.640 
again it's gonna be personal preference
as<00:05:08.880> long<00:05:09.030> as<00:05:09.210> you've<00:05:09.360> got<00:05:09.390> a<00:05:09.539> nice<00:05:09.810> solid<00:05:10.050> bow<00:05:10.380> I

00:05:10.640 --> 00:05:10.650 
as long as you've got a nice solid bow I

00:05:10.650 --> 00:05:12.469 
as long as you've got a nice solid bow I
think<00:05:10.860> you're<00:05:11.400> gonna<00:05:11.490> be<00:05:11.669> good<00:05:11.789> with<00:05:11.909> that<00:05:12.060> but

00:05:12.469 --> 00:05:12.479 
think you're gonna be good with that but

00:05:12.479 --> 00:05:14.450 
think you're gonna be good with that but
you<00:05:12.780> do<00:05:12.990> in<00:05:13.349> my<00:05:13.560> opinion<00:05:13.680> want<00:05:14.130> to<00:05:14.190> have<00:05:14.310> those

00:05:14.450 --> 00:05:14.460 
you do in my opinion want to have those

00:05:14.460 --> 00:05:16.640 
you do in my opinion want to have those
hands<00:05:14.729> open<00:05:15.240> when<00:05:15.750> you're<00:05:15.870> doing<00:05:16.110> jumps<00:05:16.409> not

00:05:16.640 --> 00:05:16.650 
hands open when you're doing jumps not

00:05:16.650 --> 00:05:18.770 
hands open when you're doing jumps not
close<00:05:17.010> if<00:05:17.280> you're<00:05:17.760> doing<00:05:17.909> an<00:05:18.060> isolation<00:05:18.630> which

00:05:18.770 --> 00:05:18.780 
close if you're doing an isolation which

00:05:18.780 --> 00:05:20.420 
close if you're doing an isolation which
we<00:05:18.930> do<00:05:19.050> every<00:05:19.080> once<00:05:19.409> in<00:05:19.470> a<00:05:19.560> while<00:05:19.590> for<00:05:19.919> fun<00:05:20.159> and

00:05:20.420 --> 00:05:20.430 
we do every once in a while for fun and

00:05:20.430 --> 00:05:22.070 
we do every once in a while for fun and
you're<00:05:20.970> keeping<00:05:21.120> your<00:05:21.360> body<00:05:21.539> real<00:05:21.780> still<00:05:22.050> and

00:05:22.070 --> 00:05:22.080 
you're keeping your body real still and

00:05:22.080 --> 00:05:23.600 
you're keeping your body real still and
stable<00:05:22.380> I<00:05:22.710> think<00:05:22.919> that's<00:05:23.099> okay

00:05:23.600 --> 00:05:23.610 
stable I think that's okay

00:05:23.610 --> 00:05:25.250 
stable I think that's okay
but<00:05:23.909> most<00:05:24.240> the<00:05:24.330> time<00:05:24.570> you're<00:05:24.690> standing<00:05:25.080> hands

00:05:25.250 --> 00:05:25.260 
but most the time you're standing hands

00:05:25.260 --> 00:05:28.310 
but most the time you're standing hands
out<00:05:25.440> now<00:05:26.340> since<00:05:26.669> that<00:05:26.729> took<00:05:27.090> so<00:05:27.300> long<00:05:27.510> I<00:05:27.810> never

00:05:28.310 --> 00:05:28.320 
out now since that took so long I never

00:05:28.320 --> 00:05:30.290 
out now since that took so long I never
have<00:05:28.620> skip<00:05:28.950> our<00:05:29.099> trainer<00:05:29.370> tip<00:05:29.640> of<00:05:29.789> the<00:05:29.880> week<00:05:30.030> I
