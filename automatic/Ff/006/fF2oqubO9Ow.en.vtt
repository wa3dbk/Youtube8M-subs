00:00:06.840 --> 00:00:06.850 
now we're gonna go into our incubation

00:00:06.850 --> 00:00:09.660 
now we're gonna go into our incubation
room<00:00:07.029> and<00:00:07.210> this<00:00:07.390> is<00:00:07.569> uh<00:00:08.160> you<00:00:09.160> know<00:00:09.280> this<00:00:09.429> is<00:00:09.490> a

room and this is uh you know this is a

00:00:09.670 --> 00:00:12.630 
room and this is uh you know this is a
stage<00:00:09.969> now<00:00:10.300> where<00:00:10.330> the<00:00:11.200> eggs<00:00:11.380> have<00:00:11.710> their<00:00:12.340> post

00:00:12.630 --> 00:00:12.640 
stage now where the eggs have their post

00:00:12.640 --> 00:00:14.339 
stage now where the eggs have their post
ID<00:00:12.970> is<00:00:13.269> what<00:00:13.420> we<00:00:13.510> call<00:00:13.660> the<00:00:13.780> ID<00:00:13.930> egg<00:00:14.110> stage

00:00:14.339 --> 00:00:14.349 
ID is what we call the ID egg stage

00:00:14.349 --> 00:00:16.710 
ID is what we call the ID egg stage
they're<00:00:14.680> there<00:00:14.980> now<00:00:15.010> hatching<00:00:15.639> out<00:00:15.730> so<00:00:16.059> you

00:00:16.710 --> 00:00:16.720

they're there now hatching out so you
know<00:00:17.019> we<00:00:17.199> have<00:00:17.349> a<00:00:17.560> Lovins<00:00:17.859> in<00:00:18.070> our<00:00:18.220> Heath<00:00:18.490> trays

00:00:18.779 --> 00:00:18.789 
know we have a Lovins in our Heath trays

00:00:18.789 --> 00:00:20.220 
know we have a Lovins in our Heath trays
and<00:00:19.029> they<00:00:19.330> haven't<00:00:19.480> been<00:00:19.660> fed<00:00:19.869> yet<00:00:20.109> they

00:00:24.329 --> 00:00:24.339 
at the developmental stage where they

00:00:24.339 --> 00:00:25.739 
at the developmental stage where they
sit<00:00:24.550> where<00:00:24.699> they<00:00:24.759> have<00:00:24.970> about<00:00:25.239> half<00:00:25.480> of<00:00:25.599> their

sit where they have about half of their
yolk<00:00:25.960> sac<00:00:26.289> and<00:00:26.589> we'll<00:00:27.339> have<00:00:27.489> a<00:00:27.519> have<00:00:28.029> a<00:00:28.060> view<00:00:28.300> of

yolk sac and we'll have a have a view of

00:00:28.359 --> 00:00:30.899 
yolk sac and we'll have a have a view of
the<00:00:28.480> of<00:00:28.869> the<00:00:29.050> elephants<00:00:29.550> and<00:00:30.550> we're<00:00:30.669> trying<00:00:30.849> to

dead eggs that the ones that didn't
hatch<00:00:37.420> and<00:00:37.960> we're<00:00:38.530> very<00:00:38.560> careful<00:00:38.980> to<00:00:39.310> try<00:00:39.460> to

00:00:39.540 --> 00:00:39.550 
hatch and we're very careful to try to

00:01:10.950 --> 00:01:10.960 
degrees right now and it varies a little

00:01:10.960 --> 00:01:13.770 
degrees right now and it varies a little
bit<00:01:11.170> with<00:01:11.350> today<00:01:11.590> at<00:01:11.740> we<00:01:11.950> know<00:01:12.270> we've<00:01:13.270> had<00:01:13.420> high

00:01:13.770 --> 00:01:13.780 
bit with today at we know we've had high

recently so right now it's creeping up a
little<00:01:20.200> bit<00:01:20.399> we<00:01:21.399> have<00:01:21.429> a<00:01:21.579> very<00:01:22.329> significant

00:01:23.840 --> 00:01:23.850 
little bit we have a very significant

underground spring it's not a it's not a

00:01:26.619 --> 00:01:28.080 
underground spring it's not a it's not a

of<00:01:28.179> the<00:01:28.240> ground<00:01:28.450> you<00:01:28.569> can<00:01:28.780> take<00:01:28.960> a<00:01:29.100> take<00:01:30.100> a

00:01:30.120 --> 00:01:30.130 
of the ground you can take a take a

00:01:30.130 --> 00:01:32.039 
of the ground you can take a take a
dramatic<00:01:30.429> picture<00:01:30.969> of<00:01:31.179> it<00:01:31.389> it<00:01:31.539> kind<00:01:31.689> of<00:01:31.840> seeps

00:01:32.039 --> 00:01:32.049 
dramatic picture of it it kind of seeps

00:01:32.049 --> 00:01:35.429 
dramatic picture of it it kind of seeps
up<00:01:32.229> gathers<00:01:32.859> in<00:01:33.009> the<00:01:33.130> in<00:01:33.340> a<00:01:33.459> in<00:01:33.490> a<00:01:34.179> creek<00:01:34.479> you

up gathers in the in a in a creek you

00:01:35.439 --> 00:01:37.109 
up gathers in the in a in a creek you
can<00:01:35.590> see<00:01:35.740> that's<00:01:35.950> the<00:01:36.159> what's<00:01:36.520> the<00:01:36.729> hatchery

00:01:37.109 --> 00:01:37.119 
can see that's the what's the hatchery

00:01:37.119 --> 00:01:39.899 
can see that's the what's the hatchery
water<00:01:37.299> supply<00:01:37.689> right<00:01:37.899> there<00:01:38.520> it's<00:01:39.520> 11<00:01:39.850> degrees

can get it from the feed but this this

00:01:58.869 --> 00:02:00.809 
can get it from the feed but this this
water<00:01:59.469> has<00:01:59.709> sufficient<00:02:00.249> calcium<00:02:00.579> that<00:02:00.729> they

00:02:00.809 --> 00:02:00.819 
water has sufficient calcium that they

00:02:00.819 --> 00:02:01.980 
water has sufficient calcium that they
actually<00:02:01.060> get<00:02:01.149> it<00:02:01.209> from<00:02:01.240> the<00:02:01.420> water<00:02:01.599> so<00:02:01.869> it's

00:02:01.980 --> 00:02:01.990 
actually get it from the water so it's

00:02:01.990 --> 00:02:04.019 
actually get it from the water so it's
uh<00:02:02.139> it's<00:02:02.499> ideal<00:02:02.889> for<00:02:03.130> a<00:02:03.159> rear<00:02:03.340> intro<00:02:03.670> this

00:02:04.019 --> 00:02:04.029 
uh it's ideal for a rear intro this

00:02:04.029 --> 00:02:06.089 
uh it's ideal for a rear intro this
