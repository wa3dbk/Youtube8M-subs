I'm<00:00:10.710> going<00:00:10.980> to<00:00:11.070> show<00:00:11.250> you<00:00:11.310> how<00:00:11.670> to<00:00:11.730> extract

00:00:12.550 --> 00:00:12.560 
I'm going to show you how to extract

00:00:12.560 --> 00:00:16.610 
I'm going to show you how to extract
ferment<00:00:13.560> and<00:00:13.770> clean<00:00:14.340> tomato<00:00:14.880> seed<00:00:15.320> first<00:00:16.320> we

00:00:16.610 --> 00:00:16.620 
ferment and clean tomato seed first we

00:00:16.620 --> 00:00:17.810 
ferment and clean tomato seed first we
have<00:00:16.740> to<00:00:16.860> make<00:00:17.010> the<00:00:17.160> distinction<00:00:17.520> between

00:00:17.810 --> 00:00:17.820 
have to make the distinction between

00:00:17.820 --> 00:00:21.200 
have to make the distinction between
ripe<00:00:18.600> eating<00:00:19.380> tomatoes<00:00:19.860> and<00:00:20.130> tomatoes<00:00:21.060> that

00:00:21.200 --> 00:00:21.210 
ripe eating tomatoes and tomatoes that

00:00:21.210 --> 00:00:24.350 
ripe eating tomatoes and tomatoes that
are<00:00:21.300> ripe<00:00:21.540> enough<00:00:21.840> for<00:00:22.260> seed<00:00:22.529> extraction<00:00:23.360> then

00:00:24.350 --> 00:00:24.360 
are ripe enough for seed extraction then

00:00:24.360 --> 00:00:26.359 
are ripe enough for seed extraction then
we<00:00:24.690> have<00:00:25.110> to<00:00:25.259> learn<00:00:25.410> the<00:00:25.650> ins<00:00:25.800> and<00:00:25.980> outs<00:00:26.160> of

00:00:26.359 --> 00:00:26.369 
we have to learn the ins and outs of

00:00:26.369 --> 00:00:28.820 
we have to learn the ins and outs of
fermenting<00:00:26.970> the<00:00:27.000> tomato<00:00:27.390> seed<00:00:27.750> and<00:00:27.990> finally

00:00:28.820 --> 00:00:28.830 
fermenting the tomato seed and finally

00:00:28.830 --> 00:00:30.230 
fermenting the tomato seed and finally
how<00:00:29.009> to<00:00:29.070> clean<00:00:29.400> them<00:00:29.550> so<00:00:29.610> that<00:00:29.939> they're<00:00:30.090> ready

00:00:30.230 --> 00:00:30.240 
how to clean them so that they're ready

00:00:30.240 --> 00:00:33.950 
how to clean them so that they're ready
for<00:00:30.300> storage<00:00:31.520> with<00:00:32.520> every<00:00:33.000> tomato<00:00:33.329> variety

00:00:33.950 --> 00:00:33.960 
for storage with every tomato variety

00:00:33.960 --> 00:00:36.010 
for storage with every tomato variety
there<00:00:34.200> are<00:00:34.320> differences<00:00:34.980> between<00:00:35.220> the

00:00:36.010 --> 00:00:36.020 
there are differences between the

00:00:36.020 --> 00:00:38.000 
there are differences between the
softness<00:00:37.020> of<00:00:37.200> the<00:00:37.260> flesh

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:38.010 
softness of the flesh

00:00:38.010 --> 00:00:40.580 
softness of the flesh
certainly<00:00:38.880> the<00:00:39.060> color<00:00:39.300> like<00:00:39.570> we<00:00:39.750> can<00:00:39.930> see<00:00:40.140> here

00:00:40.580 --> 00:00:40.590 
certainly the color like we can see here

00:00:40.590 --> 00:00:43.130 
certainly the color like we can see here
and<00:00:41.420> characteristics<00:00:42.420> that<00:00:42.480> you'll<00:00:42.840> notice

00:00:43.130 --> 00:00:43.140 
and characteristics that you'll notice

00:00:43.140 --> 00:00:44.960 
and characteristics that you'll notice
yourself<00:00:43.410> as<00:00:43.860> you<00:00:44.010> get<00:00:44.190> to<00:00:44.280> know<00:00:44.340> that<00:00:44.610> tomato

00:00:44.960 --> 00:00:44.970 
yourself as you get to know that tomato

00:00:44.970 --> 00:00:46.730 
yourself as you get to know that tomato
and<00:00:45.270> when<00:00:45.450> it's<00:00:45.600> truly<00:00:45.960> overripe<00:00:46.440> and<00:00:46.620> the

00:00:46.730 --> 00:00:46.740 
and when it's truly overripe and the

00:00:46.740 --> 00:00:49.760 
and when it's truly overripe and the
seeds<00:00:47.010> are<00:00:47.310> fully<00:00:48.000> mature<00:00:48.620> problem<00:00:49.620> with

00:00:49.760 --> 00:00:49.770 
seeds are fully mature problem with

00:00:49.770 --> 00:00:53.570 
seeds are fully mature problem with
having<00:00:50.370> excessively<00:00:51.360> ripe<00:00:51.720> fruit<00:00:52.200> is<00:00:52.580> if

00:00:53.570 --> 00:00:53.580 
having excessively ripe fruit is if

00:00:53.580 --> 00:00:57.320 
having excessively ripe fruit is if
disease<00:00:54.060> get<00:00:54.360> started<00:00:54.870> it<00:00:55.080> can<00:00:55.760> spread<00:00:56.760> to<00:00:56.850> the

00:00:57.320 --> 00:00:57.330 
disease get started it can spread to the

00:00:57.330 --> 00:01:00.170 
disease get started it can spread to the
seed<00:00:57.630> and<00:00:58.250> of<00:00:59.250> course<00:00:59.490> there's<00:00:59.820> always<00:01:00.060> the

00:01:00.170 --> 00:01:00.180 
seed and of course there's always the

00:01:00.180 --> 00:01:02.870 
seed and of course there's always the
danger<00:01:00.450> of<00:01:00.720> the<00:01:01.050> seeds<00:01:01.320> sprouting<00:01:01.950> inside<00:01:02.610> the

00:01:02.870 --> 00:01:02.880 
danger of the seeds sprouting inside the

00:01:02.880 --> 00:01:04.729 
danger of the seeds sprouting inside the
tomato<00:01:03.180> before<00:01:03.420> you<00:01:03.780> have<00:01:03.960> a<00:01:04.199> chance<00:01:04.470> to

00:01:04.729 --> 00:01:04.739 
tomato before you have a chance to

00:01:04.739 --> 00:01:07.490 
tomato before you have a chance to
extract<00:01:05.159> it<00:01:05.479> now<00:01:06.479> I'm<00:01:06.570> going<00:01:06.810> to<00:01:06.900> show<00:01:07.080> you<00:01:07.110> how

00:01:07.490 --> 00:01:07.500 
extract it now I'm going to show you how

00:01:07.500 --> 00:01:11.570 
extract it now I'm going to show you how
to<00:01:07.530> extract<00:01:08.280> the<00:01:08.520> seeds<00:01:10.100> through<00:01:11.100> a<00:01:11.130> series<00:01:11.549> of

00:01:11.570 --> 00:01:11.580 
to extract the seeds through a series of

00:01:11.580 --> 00:01:15.499 
to extract the seeds through a series of
cuts<00:01:12.350> so<00:01:13.350> you<00:01:13.409> can<00:01:13.679> still<00:01:14.070> use<00:01:14.520> the<00:01:14.880> tomato<00:01:15.210> for

00:01:15.499 --> 00:01:15.509 
cuts so you can still use the tomato for

00:01:15.509 --> 00:01:17.899 
cuts so you can still use the tomato for
eating<00:01:16.100> so<00:01:17.100> essentially<00:01:17.579> what<00:01:17.729> we're<00:01:17.880> doing

00:01:17.899 --> 00:01:17.909 
eating so essentially what we're doing

00:01:17.909 --> 00:01:20.779 
eating so essentially what we're doing
is<00:01:18.390> we're<00:01:18.689> making<00:01:18.719> a<00:01:19.289> series<00:01:20.280> of<00:01:20.310> cuts<00:01:20.609> on<00:01:20.759> a

00:01:20.779 --> 00:01:20.789 
is we're making a series of cuts on a

00:01:20.789 --> 00:01:22.760 
is we're making a series of cuts on a
big<00:01:21.030> tomato<00:01:21.359> it's<00:01:21.539> often<00:01:21.899> cutting<00:01:22.499> it<00:01:22.619> into

00:01:22.760 --> 00:01:22.770 
big tomato it's often cutting it into

00:01:22.770 --> 00:01:25.399 
big tomato it's often cutting it into
eight<00:01:22.979> segments<00:01:23.640> so<00:01:24.299> we're<00:01:24.479> exposing<00:01:25.229> these

00:01:25.399 --> 00:01:25.409 
eight segments so we're exposing these

00:01:25.409 --> 00:01:29.120 
eight segments so we're exposing these
locules<00:01:26.399> or<00:01:26.700> seed<00:01:27.119> cavities<00:01:27.659> to<00:01:28.409> easy<00:01:28.619> access

00:01:29.120 --> 00:01:29.130 
locules or seed cavities to easy access

00:01:29.130 --> 00:01:31.219 
locules or seed cavities to easy access
with<00:01:29.369> the<00:01:29.520> spoon<00:01:29.819> or<00:01:30.119> fingers<00:01:30.840> and<00:01:31.079> however

00:01:31.219 --> 00:01:31.229 
with the spoon or fingers and however

00:01:31.229 --> 00:01:33.830 
with the spoon or fingers and however
you<00:01:31.380> want<00:01:31.619> to<00:01:31.710> do<00:01:31.829> it<00:01:32.390> keep<00:01:33.390> going<00:01:33.719> your

00:01:33.830 --> 00:01:33.840 
you want to do it keep going your

00:01:33.840 --> 00:01:36.200 
you want to do it keep going your
chances<00:01:34.350> of<00:01:34.530> cutting<00:01:35.130> right<00:01:35.340> into<00:01:35.399> one<00:01:36.119> of

00:01:36.200 --> 00:01:36.210 
chances of cutting right into one of

00:01:36.210 --> 00:01:40.219 
chances of cutting right into one of
these<00:01:36.329> seed<00:01:36.869> cavities<00:01:37.670> if<00:01:38.670> you<00:01:38.880> make<00:01:39.229> eight

00:01:40.219 --> 00:01:40.229 
these seed cavities if you make eight

00:01:40.229 --> 00:01:43.440 
these seed cavities if you make eight
cuts<00:01:40.649> is<00:01:40.950> very<00:01:41.880> good

00:01:43.440 --> 00:01:43.450 
cuts is very good

00:01:43.450 --> 00:01:45.779 
cuts is very good
I<00:01:43.570> often<00:01:43.990> just<00:01:44.350> use<00:01:44.500> a<00:01:44.530> spoon<00:01:44.920> you<00:01:45.490> can<00:01:45.520> use<00:01:45.759> a

00:01:45.779 --> 00:01:45.789 
I often just use a spoon you can use a

00:01:45.789 --> 00:01:48.779 
I often just use a spoon you can use a
pointed<00:01:46.360> end<00:01:46.689> of<00:01:46.899> a<00:01:46.990> knife<00:01:47.549> whatever<00:01:48.549> tool

00:01:48.779 --> 00:01:48.789 
pointed end of a knife whatever tool

00:01:48.789 --> 00:01:52.139 
pointed end of a knife whatever tool
works<00:01:49.119> best<00:01:49.479> and<00:01:49.840> I<00:01:50.409> just<00:01:51.310> go<00:01:51.520> right<00:01:51.789> into<00:01:52.000> that

00:01:52.139 --> 00:01:52.149 
works best and I just go right into that

00:01:52.149 --> 00:01:54.899 
works best and I just go right into that
cavity<00:01:52.799> lock<00:01:53.799> you'll<00:01:54.039> and<00:01:54.399> scoop<00:01:54.729> out<00:01:54.850> the

00:01:54.899 --> 00:01:54.909 
cavity lock you'll and scoop out the

00:01:54.909 --> 00:01:57.470 
cavity lock you'll and scoop out the
seeds

00:01:57.470 --> 00:01:57.480 

00:01:57.480 --> 00:02:00.580 

there<00:01:58.050> is<00:01:58.620> still<00:01:59.010> a<00:01:59.040> nice<00:01:59.250> edible<00:01:59.640> slice

00:02:00.580 --> 00:02:00.590 
there is still a nice edible slice

00:02:00.590 --> 00:02:04.300 
there is still a nice edible slice
people<00:02:01.590> do<00:02:01.890> ask<00:02:02.070> about<00:02:02.520> how<00:02:02.730> much<00:02:03.030> of<00:02:03.060> the<00:02:03.330> pulp

00:02:04.300 --> 00:02:04.310 
people do ask about how much of the pulp

00:02:04.310 --> 00:02:08.330 
people do ask about how much of the pulp
needs<00:02:05.310> to<00:02:05.670> be<00:02:06.600> n<00:02:06.780> and<00:02:07.110> you<00:02:07.140> see<00:02:07.560> there<00:02:07.830> I<00:02:08.010> just

00:02:08.330 --> 00:02:08.340 
needs to be n and you see there I just

00:02:08.340 --> 00:02:11.060 
needs to be n and you see there I just
put<00:02:08.550> all<00:02:08.730> of<00:02:08.880> that<00:02:09.090> placental<00:02:09.930> Pope<00:02:10.770> that

00:02:11.060 --> 00:02:11.070 
put all of that placental Pope that

00:02:11.070 --> 00:02:15.320 
put all of that placental Pope that
gelatinous<00:02:12.260> good<00:02:13.260> stuff<00:02:13.590> actually<00:02:14.220> much<00:02:15.210> of

00:02:15.320 --> 00:02:15.330 
gelatinous good stuff actually much of

00:02:15.330 --> 00:02:18.200 
gelatinous good stuff actually much of
the<00:02:15.420> flavor<00:02:15.630> is<00:02:15.900> in<00:02:16.080> that<00:02:16.290> gelatin<00:02:17.190> that<00:02:17.400> in

00:02:18.200 --> 00:02:18.210 
the flavor is in that gelatin that in

00:02:18.210 --> 00:02:21.380 
the flavor is in that gelatin that in
cases<00:02:18.450> the<00:02:18.840> seeds<00:02:19.140> and<00:02:19.820> you'll<00:02:20.820> notice<00:02:21.090> that

00:02:21.380 --> 00:02:21.390 
cases the seeds and you'll notice that

00:02:21.390 --> 00:02:22.610 
cases the seeds and you'll notice that
when<00:02:21.540> you<00:02:21.660> do<00:02:21.780> eat<00:02:21.930> these<00:02:22.110> tomatoes

00:02:22.610 --> 00:02:22.620 
when you do eat these tomatoes

00:02:22.620 --> 00:02:24.140 
when you do eat these tomatoes
afterwards<00:02:23.190> now<00:02:23.340> here's<00:02:23.580> one<00:02:23.790> where<00:02:24.000> it<00:02:24.120> was

00:02:24.140 --> 00:02:24.150 
afterwards now here's one where it was

00:02:24.150 --> 00:02:29.540 
afterwards now here's one where it was
cut<00:02:24.450> so<00:02:24.830> thin<00:02:25.830> that<00:02:26.660> that<00:02:27.710> it's<00:02:28.710> just<00:02:29.070> best<00:02:29.340> to

00:02:29.540 --> 00:02:29.550 
cut so thin that that it's just best to

00:02:29.550 --> 00:02:31.430 
cut so thin that that it's just best to
get<00:02:29.670> that<00:02:29.880> whole<00:02:30.090> segment<00:02:30.510> in<00:02:31.020> the

00:02:31.430 --> 00:02:31.440 
get that whole segment in the

00:02:31.440 --> 00:02:33.830 
get that whole segment in the
fermentation<00:02:31.860> all<00:02:32.670> of<00:02:33.120> that<00:02:33.270> tissue<00:02:33.510> will

00:02:33.830 --> 00:02:33.840 
fermentation all of that tissue will

00:02:33.840 --> 00:02:35.720 
fermentation all of that tissue will
start<00:02:34.110> to<00:02:34.260> break<00:02:34.500> down<00:02:34.740> and<00:02:34.980> we'll<00:02:35.130> release

00:02:35.720 --> 00:02:35.730 
start to break down and we'll release

00:02:35.730 --> 00:02:38.510 
start to break down and we'll release
the<00:02:35.790> tomato<00:02:36.330> so<00:02:36.570> it's<00:02:36.690> not<00:02:36.840> a<00:02:36.900> problem<00:02:37.430> if<00:02:38.430> you

00:02:38.510 --> 00:02:38.520 
the tomato so it's not a problem if you

00:02:38.520 --> 00:02:42.140 
the tomato so it's not a problem if you
have<00:02:38.790> a<00:02:38.820> lot<00:02:39.030> of<00:02:39.060> tomatoes<00:02:39.660> and<00:02:40.850> want<00:02:41.850> to<00:02:41.880> speed

00:02:42.140 --> 00:02:42.150 
have a lot of tomatoes and want to speed

00:02:42.150 --> 00:02:44.540 
have a lot of tomatoes and want to speed
this<00:02:42.330> process<00:02:42.600> up<00:02:43.050> you<00:02:43.620> make<00:02:43.800> a<00:02:43.830> radial<00:02:44.280> cut

00:02:44.540 --> 00:02:44.550 
this process up you make a radial cut

00:02:44.550 --> 00:02:47.360 
this process up you make a radial cut
along<00:02:44.880> the<00:02:45.060> equator<00:02:45.420> of<00:02:45.540> the<00:02:45.810> tomato<00:02:46.140> and<00:02:46.500> then

00:02:47.360 --> 00:02:47.370 
along the equator of the tomato and then

00:02:47.370 --> 00:02:49.270 
along the equator of the tomato and then
you<00:02:47.520> just<00:02:47.760> bring<00:02:48.180> it<00:02:48.360> right<00:02:48.390> in<00:02:48.750> and<00:02:49.050> you

00:02:49.270 --> 00:02:49.280 
you just bring it right in and you

00:02:49.280 --> 00:02:51.980 
you just bring it right in and you
essentially<00:02:50.450> just<00:02:51.450> squeeze<00:02:51.720> it<00:02:51.870> like

00:02:51.980 --> 00:02:51.990 
essentially just squeeze it like

00:02:51.990 --> 00:02:54.560 
essentially just squeeze it like
squeezing<00:02:52.500> a<00:02:52.560> lemon<00:02:52.710> tomato<00:02:53.700> seeds<00:02:54.030> tend<00:02:54.450> to

00:02:54.560 --> 00:02:54.570 
squeezing a lemon tomato seeds tend to

00:02:54.570 --> 00:02:58.040 
squeezing a lemon tomato seeds tend to
shoot<00:02:54.840> all<00:02:55.050> over<00:02:55.080> and<00:02:56.180> as<00:02:57.180> much<00:02:57.450> of<00:02:57.510> that<00:02:57.660> pulp

00:02:58.040 --> 00:02:58.050 
shoot all over and as much of that pulp

00:02:58.050 --> 00:03:01.190 
shoot all over and as much of that pulp
as<00:02:58.320> you<00:02:58.500> get<00:02:58.680> in<00:02:58.860> it's<00:02:59.040> not<00:02:59.220> a<00:02:59.280> problem<00:02:59.700> and<00:03:00.200> you

00:03:01.190 --> 00:03:01.200 
as you get in it's not a problem and you

00:03:01.200 --> 00:03:04.360 
as you get in it's not a problem and you
may<00:03:01.350> not<00:03:01.500> get<00:03:01.740> every<00:03:02.010> last<00:03:02.250> seed

00:03:04.360 --> 00:03:04.370 
may not get every last seed

00:03:04.370 --> 00:03:06.339 
may not get every last seed
so<00:03:05.000> now<00:03:05.120> you<00:03:05.180> can<00:03:05.420> see<00:03:05.629> that<00:03:05.870> we<00:03:05.959> have<00:03:06.110> plenty

00:03:06.339 --> 00:03:06.349 
so now you can see that we have plenty

00:03:06.349 --> 00:03:10.360 
so now you can see that we have plenty
of<00:03:06.640> nice<00:03:07.640> slurry<00:03:08.150> in<00:03:08.360> here<00:03:08.720> to<00:03:09.110> get<00:03:09.260> a<00:03:09.739> good

00:03:10.360 --> 00:03:10.370 
of nice slurry in here to get a good

00:03:10.370 --> 00:03:12.880 
of nice slurry in here to get a good
fermentation<00:03:11.180> started<00:03:11.660> also<00:03:12.410> the<00:03:12.739> other

00:03:12.880 --> 00:03:12.890 
fermentation started also the other

00:03:12.890 --> 00:03:14.619 
fermentation started also the other
thing<00:03:13.160> you<00:03:13.280> always<00:03:13.550> want<00:03:13.760> to<00:03:13.819> make<00:03:13.879> sure<00:03:14.209> to<00:03:14.420> do

00:03:14.619 --> 00:03:14.629 
thing you always want to make sure to do

00:03:14.629 --> 00:03:18.400 
thing you always want to make sure to do
is<00:03:15.620> to<00:03:15.980> label<00:03:16.220> your<00:03:16.610> jar<00:03:16.970> with<00:03:17.690> the<00:03:17.720> name<00:03:18.110> of

00:03:18.400 --> 00:03:18.410 
is to label your jar with the name of

00:03:18.410 --> 00:03:21.400 
is to label your jar with the name of
the<00:03:18.530> variety<00:03:19.099> and<00:03:19.390> also<00:03:20.390> it<00:03:20.480> helps<00:03:20.599> to<00:03:20.810> put<00:03:21.290> the

00:03:21.400 --> 00:03:21.410 
the variety and also it helps to put the

00:03:21.410 --> 00:03:23.050 
the variety and also it helps to put the
date<00:03:21.590> on<00:03:21.620> there<00:03:21.980> so<00:03:22.129> you<00:03:22.160> know<00:03:22.370> how<00:03:22.610> long<00:03:22.849> it's

00:03:23.050 --> 00:03:23.060 
date on there so you know how long it's

00:03:23.060 --> 00:03:24.640 
date on there so you know how long it's
been<00:03:23.150> fermenting<00:03:23.750> when<00:03:23.900> it's<00:03:24.049> time<00:03:24.260> to<00:03:24.290> clean

00:03:24.640 --> 00:03:24.650 
been fermenting when it's time to clean

00:03:24.650 --> 00:03:26.400 
been fermenting when it's time to clean
it

00:03:26.400 --> 00:03:26.410 
it

00:03:26.410 --> 00:03:28.680 
it
I'd<00:03:27.130> like<00:03:27.280> to<00:03:27.430> show<00:03:27.610> you<00:03:27.640> the<00:03:27.940> three<00:03:28.180> stages<00:03:28.510> of

00:03:28.680 --> 00:03:28.690 
I'd like to show you the three stages of

00:03:28.690 --> 00:03:30.750 
I'd like to show you the three stages of
fermentation<00:03:29.040> here<00:03:30.040> we<00:03:30.190> have<00:03:30.310> seed<00:03:30.580> that

00:03:30.750 --> 00:03:30.760 
fermentation here we have seed that

00:03:30.760 --> 00:03:33.240 
fermentation here we have seed that
we've<00:03:30.910> just<00:03:31.210> extracted<00:03:31.930> it's<00:03:32.770> suspended

00:03:33.240 --> 00:03:33.250 
we've just extracted it's suspended

00:03:33.250 --> 00:03:36.150 
we've just extracted it's suspended
nicely<00:03:33.820> in<00:03:33.970> the<00:03:34.060> slurry<00:03:34.390> but<00:03:35.260> it<00:03:35.380> needs<00:03:35.860> to

00:03:36.150 --> 00:03:36.160 
nicely in the slurry but it needs to

00:03:36.160 --> 00:03:38.220 
nicely in the slurry but it needs to
separate<00:03:36.910> we<00:03:37.030> need<00:03:37.210> to<00:03:37.330> separate<00:03:37.690> that<00:03:37.900> seed

00:03:38.220 --> 00:03:38.230 
separate we need to separate that seed

00:03:38.230 --> 00:03:40.940 
separate we need to separate that seed
out<00:03:38.820> that<00:03:39.820> was<00:03:39.970> done<00:03:40.210> today

00:03:40.940 --> 00:03:40.950 
out that was done today

00:03:40.950 --> 00:03:44.850 
out that was done today
this<00:03:41.950> next<00:03:42.670> jar<00:03:43.300> is<00:03:43.540> seed<00:03:44.200> that<00:03:44.380> was<00:03:44.500> extracted

00:03:44.850 --> 00:03:44.860 
this next jar is seed that was extracted

00:03:44.860 --> 00:03:47.520 
this next jar is seed that was extracted
two<00:03:45.340> days<00:03:45.580> ago<00:03:45.820> it's<00:03:46.360> fermenting<00:03:46.990> nicely

00:03:47.520 --> 00:03:47.530 
two days ago it's fermenting nicely

00:03:47.530 --> 00:03:49.620 
two days ago it's fermenting nicely
there's<00:03:47.770> a<00:03:47.860> clear<00:03:48.190> fermentation<00:03:49.090> layer<00:03:49.300> on

00:03:49.620 --> 00:03:49.630 
there's a clear fermentation layer on

00:03:49.630 --> 00:03:53.240 
there's a clear fermentation layer on
top<00:03:49.960> and<00:03:50.320> you<00:03:51.070> can<00:03:51.250> see<00:03:51.490> some<00:03:51.790> of<00:03:51.940> the<00:03:52.000> seed<00:03:52.240> has

00:03:53.240 --> 00:03:53.250 
top and you can see some of the seed has

00:03:53.250 --> 00:03:55.740 
top and you can see some of the seed has
settled<00:03:54.250> out<00:03:54.460> and<00:03:54.760> dropped<00:03:55.120> to<00:03:55.270> the<00:03:55.390> bottom

00:03:55.740 --> 00:03:55.750 
settled out and dropped to the bottom

00:03:55.750 --> 00:03:58.320 
settled out and dropped to the bottom
there<00:03:56.010> that's<00:03:57.010> perfect<00:03:57.550> that's<00:03:57.880> right<00:03:58.150> where

00:03:58.320 --> 00:03:58.330 
there that's perfect that's right where

00:03:58.330 --> 00:04:00.660 
there that's perfect that's right where
we<00:03:58.540> want<00:03:58.750> to<00:03:58.840> be<00:03:58.930> in<00:03:59.080> this<00:03:59.260> essentially<00:04:00.070> three

00:04:00.660 --> 00:04:00.670 
we want to be in this essentially three

00:04:00.670 --> 00:04:03.690 
we want to be in this essentially three
to<00:04:00.760> four<00:04:00.970> day<00:04:01.120> process<00:04:02.250> and<00:04:03.250> that<00:04:03.400> was<00:04:03.550> done

00:04:03.690 --> 00:04:03.700 
to four day process and that was done

00:04:03.700 --> 00:04:06.300 
to four day process and that was done
two<00:04:03.970> days<00:04:04.150> ago<00:04:04.710> then<00:04:05.710> we<00:04:05.740> have<00:04:05.980> a<00:04:06.010> yellow

00:04:06.300 --> 00:04:06.310 
two days ago then we have a yellow

00:04:06.310 --> 00:04:09.510 
two days ago then we have a yellow
tomato<00:04:06.790> that<00:04:07.570> was<00:04:07.780> extracted<00:04:08.680> four<00:04:09.040> days<00:04:09.280> ago

00:04:09.510 --> 00:04:09.520 
tomato that was extracted four days ago

00:04:09.520 --> 00:04:12.540 
tomato that was extracted four days ago
and<00:04:09.970> it<00:04:10.840> has<00:04:11.020> already<00:04:11.230> gone<00:04:11.530> through<00:04:11.860> most<00:04:12.370> of

00:04:12.540 --> 00:04:12.550 
and it has already gone through most of

00:04:12.550 --> 00:04:15.810 
and it has already gone through most of
its<00:04:12.670> fermentation<00:04:13.480> the<00:04:14.200> seed<00:04:14.670> settled<00:04:15.670> out

00:04:15.810 --> 00:04:15.820 
its fermentation the seed settled out

00:04:15.820 --> 00:04:18.150 
its fermentation the seed settled out
first<00:04:16.180> then<00:04:16.630> the<00:04:16.810> slurry<00:04:17.230> starts<00:04:17.709> to<00:04:17.890> settle

00:04:18.150 --> 00:04:18.160 
first then the slurry starts to settle

00:04:18.160 --> 00:04:20.430 
first then the slurry starts to settle
and<00:04:18.549> that's<00:04:19.359> what<00:04:19.570> it<00:04:19.660> looks<00:04:19.900> like<00:04:20.109> kind<00:04:20.350> of

00:04:20.430 --> 00:04:20.440 
and that's what it looks like kind of

00:04:20.440 --> 00:04:23.520 
and that's what it looks like kind of
milky<00:04:20.950> and<00:04:21.420> that's<00:04:22.420> at<00:04:22.660> four<00:04:22.900> days<00:04:23.080> and<00:04:23.410> that's

00:04:23.520 --> 00:04:23.530 
milky and that's at four days and that's

00:04:23.530 --> 00:04:26.870 
milky and that's at four days and that's
ready<00:04:23.860> to<00:04:24.040> clean<00:04:24.310> essentially

00:04:26.870 --> 00:04:26.880 
ready to clean essentially

00:04:26.880 --> 00:04:29.240 
ready to clean essentially
so<00:04:27.720> oftentimes<00:04:28.350> when<00:04:28.650> you're<00:04:28.770> first<00:04:29.040> trying

00:04:29.240 --> 00:04:29.250 
so oftentimes when you're first trying

00:04:29.250 --> 00:04:32.620 
so oftentimes when you're first trying
to<00:04:29.430> clean<00:04:29.760> the<00:04:29.940> pulp<00:04:30.270> the<00:04:31.230> seed<00:04:31.560> is<00:04:31.890> still

00:04:32.620 --> 00:04:32.630 
to clean the pulp the seed is still

00:04:32.630 --> 00:04:35.330 
to clean the pulp the seed is still
entwined<00:04:33.630> with<00:04:33.930> it<00:04:34.110> it's<00:04:34.260> loosened<00:04:34.980> from<00:04:35.130> the

00:04:35.330 --> 00:04:35.340 
entwined with it it's loosened from the

00:04:35.340 --> 00:04:39.970 
entwined with it it's loosened from the
placental<00:04:36.000> sacs<00:04:36.360> but<00:04:36.720> it<00:04:36.840> needs<00:04:37.110> to<00:04:37.290> be<00:04:37.440> a

00:04:39.970 --> 00:04:39.980 

00:04:39.980 --> 00:04:42.860 

little<00:04:40.980> further<00:04:41.370> loosened<00:04:42.090> up<00:04:42.240> from<00:04:42.480> the<00:04:42.600> pulp

00:04:42.860 --> 00:04:42.870 
little further loosened up from the pulp

00:04:42.870 --> 00:04:46.100 
little further loosened up from the pulp
so<00:04:43.140> you<00:04:43.200> see<00:04:43.470> we're<00:04:43.650> gonna<00:04:43.740> pour<00:04:44.100> this<00:04:44.280> in<00:04:45.110> and

00:04:46.100 --> 00:04:46.110 
so you see we're gonna pour this in and

00:04:46.110 --> 00:04:50.210 
so you see we're gonna pour this in and
on<00:04:46.260> some<00:04:46.500> water<00:04:46.820> and<00:04:47.840> even<00:04:48.840> a<00:04:48.930> good<00:04:49.170> jet<00:04:49.650> of

00:04:50.210 --> 00:04:50.220 
on some water and even a good jet of

00:04:50.220 --> 00:04:53.300 
on some water and even a good jet of
water<00:04:51.080> this<00:04:52.080> is<00:04:52.350> really<00:04:52.680> nice<00:04:52.860> to<00:04:53.100> have<00:04:53.160> this

00:04:53.300 --> 00:04:53.310 
water this is really nice to have this

00:04:53.310 --> 00:04:56.000 
water this is really nice to have this
kind<00:04:53.580> of<00:04:53.640> attachment<00:04:54.360> here<00:04:54.600> you<00:04:55.380> can<00:04:55.560> get<00:04:55.800> a

00:04:56.000 --> 00:04:56.010 
kind of attachment here you can get a

00:04:56.010 --> 00:04:58.100 
kind of attachment here you can get a
lot<00:04:56.250> of<00:04:56.370> the<00:04:56.460> pulp<00:04:56.790> to<00:04:57.030> actually<00:04:57.480> go<00:04:57.720> through

00:04:58.100 --> 00:04:58.110 
lot of the pulp to actually go through

00:04:58.110 --> 00:05:01.100 
lot of the pulp to actually go through
the<00:04:58.440> screen<00:04:58.830> and<00:04:59.450> then<00:05:00.450> the<00:05:00.570> other<00:05:00.720> thing<00:05:00.990> you

00:05:01.100 --> 00:05:01.110 
the screen and then the other thing you

00:05:01.110 --> 00:05:06.230 
the screen and then the other thing you
can<00:05:01.260> do<00:05:02.000> is<00:05:03.000> you<00:05:03.270> can<00:05:03.420> rub<00:05:03.870> this<00:05:05.090> you're<00:05:06.090> not

00:05:06.230 --> 00:05:06.240 
can do is you can rub this you're not

00:05:06.240 --> 00:05:08.180 
can do is you can rub this you're not
going<00:05:06.450> to<00:05:06.510> damage<00:05:06.720> the<00:05:07.080> seed<00:05:07.320> by<00:05:07.560> rubbing<00:05:08.070> it

00:05:08.180 --> 00:05:08.190 
going to damage the seed by rubbing it

00:05:08.190 --> 00:05:13.070 
going to damage the seed by rubbing it
against<00:05:08.580> the<00:05:08.700> screen<00:05:10.190> you<00:05:11.190> rub<00:05:11.430> this<00:05:11.700> and<00:05:12.080> all

00:05:13.070 --> 00:05:13.080 
against the screen you rub this and all

00:05:13.080 --> 00:05:16.580 
against the screen you rub this and all
of<00:05:13.110> a<00:05:13.320> sudden<00:05:13.710> you're<00:05:14.010> about<00:05:15.410> fifty<00:05:16.410> percent

00:05:16.580 --> 00:05:16.590 
of a sudden you're about fifty percent

00:05:16.590 --> 00:05:19.930 
of a sudden you're about fifty percent
clean<00:05:17.100> there<00:05:17.430> you're<00:05:18.330> going<00:05:18.600> to<00:05:18.690> put<00:05:18.960> this

00:05:19.930 --> 00:05:19.940 
clean there you're going to put this

00:05:19.940 --> 00:05:23.570 
clean there you're going to put this
seed<00:05:20.940> into<00:05:21.180> a<00:05:21.360> bowl<00:05:21.660> to<00:05:22.020> get<00:05:22.170> it<00:05:22.290> back<00:05:22.530> into<00:05:22.980> a

00:05:23.570 --> 00:05:23.580 
seed into a bowl to get it back into a

00:05:23.580 --> 00:05:27.260 
seed into a bowl to get it back into a
jar<00:05:24.740> so<00:05:25.740> as<00:05:25.860> you<00:05:25.980> can<00:05:26.130> see<00:05:26.190> this<00:05:26.640> pulp<00:05:27.090> is

00:05:27.260 --> 00:05:27.270 
jar so as you can see this pulp is

00:05:27.270 --> 00:05:30.230 
jar so as you can see this pulp is
floating<00:05:27.900> now<00:05:28.080> and<00:05:28.410> it<00:05:28.590> truly<00:05:28.800> is<00:05:29.240> separate

00:05:30.230 --> 00:05:30.240 
floating now and it truly is separate

00:05:30.240 --> 00:05:32.690 
floating now and it truly is separate
from<00:05:30.390> the<00:05:30.570> seeds<00:05:30.900> which<00:05:31.230> have<00:05:31.520> sunk<00:05:32.520> to<00:05:32.550> the

00:05:32.690 --> 00:05:32.700 
from the seeds which have sunk to the

00:05:32.700 --> 00:05:35.210 
from the seeds which have sunk to the
bottom<00:05:32.760> nicely<00:05:33.510> and<00:05:33.810> you<00:05:34.320> just<00:05:34.500> ever<00:05:34.800> so

00:05:35.210 --> 00:05:35.220 
bottom nicely and you just ever so

00:05:35.220 --> 00:05:39.290 
bottom nicely and you just ever so
slowly<00:05:35.640> pour<00:05:36.150> that<00:05:36.360> off<00:05:37.550> to<00:05:38.550> get<00:05:38.700> the<00:05:38.820> pulp<00:05:39.090> now

00:05:39.290 --> 00:05:39.300 
slowly pour that off to get the pulp now

00:05:39.300 --> 00:05:44.440 
slowly pour that off to get the pulp now
you<00:05:39.360> might<00:05:39.840> lose<00:05:40.140> a<00:05:40.170> couple<00:05:40.590> of<00:05:40.740> seeds<00:05:42.410> as<00:05:43.410> this

00:05:44.440 --> 00:05:44.450 
you might lose a couple of seeds as this

00:05:44.450 --> 00:05:46.730 
you might lose a couple of seeds as this
master<00:05:45.450> seed<00:05:45.690> cleaner<00:05:46.020> I<00:05:46.140> used<00:05:46.410> to<00:05:46.530> work<00:05:46.710> with

00:05:46.730 --> 00:05:46.740 
master seed cleaner I used to work with

00:05:46.740 --> 00:05:49.610 
master seed cleaner I used to work with
always<00:05:47.220> said<00:05:47.720> if<00:05:48.720> you're<00:05:48.840> gonna<00:05:48.900> clean<00:05:49.260> seed

00:05:49.610 --> 00:05:49.620 
always said if you're gonna clean seed

00:05:49.620 --> 00:05:51.380 
always said if you're gonna clean seed
you<00:05:49.980> got<00:05:50.130> to<00:05:50.220> throw<00:05:50.430> a<00:05:50.460> little<00:05:50.670> bit<00:05:50.880> away<00:05:51.120> and

00:05:51.380 --> 00:05:51.390 
you got to throw a little bit away and

00:05:51.390 --> 00:05:52.670 
you got to throw a little bit away and
that's<00:05:51.630> what<00:05:51.840> always<00:05:51.990> happens

00:05:52.670 --> 00:05:52.680 
that's what always happens

00:05:52.680 --> 00:05:56.030 
that's what always happens
so<00:05:53.190> now<00:05:53.340> we<00:05:53.400> can<00:05:53.900> decant<00:05:54.900> again<00:05:55.200> that<00:05:55.410> seed<00:05:55.800> is

00:05:56.030 --> 00:05:56.040 
so now we can decant again that seed is

00:05:56.040 --> 00:05:59.360 
so now we can decant again that seed is
mostly<00:05:57.410> cleaned<00:05:58.410> from<00:05:58.680> that<00:05:58.920> quick<00:05:59.160> of

00:05:59.360 --> 00:05:59.370 
mostly cleaned from that quick of

00:05:59.370 --> 00:06:02.120 
mostly cleaned from that quick of
decanting<00:05:59.970> it<00:06:00.180> fermented<00:06:00.780> nicely<00:06:01.320> but<00:06:01.860> here's

00:06:02.120 --> 00:06:02.130 
decanting it fermented nicely but here's

00:06:02.130 --> 00:06:03.380 
decanting it fermented nicely but here's
what<00:06:02.250> we're<00:06:02.340> gonna<00:06:02.430> do<00:06:02.670> we're<00:06:02.850> gonna<00:06:02.910> run<00:06:03.240> it

00:06:03.380 --> 00:06:03.390 
what we're gonna do we're gonna run it

00:06:03.390 --> 00:06:06.950 
what we're gonna do we're gonna run it
back<00:06:03.600> through<00:06:04.020> our<00:06:04.260> screen<00:06:05.540> but<00:06:06.540> the<00:06:06.630> more<00:06:06.840> you

00:06:06.950 --> 00:06:06.960 
back through our screen but the more you

00:06:06.960 --> 00:06:10.760 
back through our screen but the more you
can<00:06:07.110> blast<00:06:07.410> it<00:06:08.000> and<00:06:09.000> then<00:06:09.780> rub<00:06:10.140> it<00:06:10.170> against<00:06:10.620> the

00:06:10.760 --> 00:06:10.770 
can blast it and then rub it against the

00:06:10.770 --> 00:06:12.470 
can blast it and then rub it against the
screen<00:06:11.010> rubbing<00:06:11.670> the<00:06:11.790> seed<00:06:12.030> against<00:06:12.300> the

00:06:12.470 --> 00:06:12.480 
screen rubbing the seed against the

00:06:12.480 --> 00:06:15.740 
screen rubbing the seed against the
screen<00:06:12.980> loosens<00:06:13.980> any<00:06:14.370> last<00:06:14.760> pulp<00:06:15.300> that<00:06:15.510> might

00:06:15.740 --> 00:06:15.750 
screen loosens any last pulp that might

00:06:15.750 --> 00:06:19.400 
screen loosens any last pulp that might
be<00:06:15.930> attached<00:06:16.520> the<00:06:17.520> seeds<00:06:17.820> that<00:06:17.970> float<00:06:18.720> are

00:06:19.400 --> 00:06:19.410 
be attached the seeds that float are

00:06:19.410 --> 00:06:21.950 
be attached the seeds that float are
generally<00:06:19.830> not<00:06:20.070> your<00:06:20.460> good<00:06:20.760> seeds<00:06:21.180> anyway<00:06:21.900> so

00:06:21.950 --> 00:06:21.960 
generally not your good seeds anyway so

00:06:21.960 --> 00:06:24.110 
generally not your good seeds anyway so
it's<00:06:22.410> not<00:06:22.620> that<00:06:22.950> big<00:06:23.220> of<00:06:23.280> a<00:06:23.460> deal<00:06:23.670> to<00:06:23.940> lose<00:06:24.090> a

00:06:24.110 --> 00:06:24.120 
it's not that big of a deal to lose a

00:06:24.120 --> 00:06:28.190 
it's not that big of a deal to lose a
few<00:06:24.480> of<00:06:24.600> those<00:06:24.720> we<00:06:25.560> have<00:06:25.710> clean<00:06:25.980> seed<00:06:27.200> we're

00:06:28.190 --> 00:06:28.200 
few of those we have clean seed we're

00:06:28.200 --> 00:06:29.960 
few of those we have clean seed we're
gonna<00:06:28.320> put<00:06:28.560> it<00:06:28.650> in<00:06:28.770> this<00:06:28.920> slightly<00:06:29.580> smaller

00:06:29.960 --> 00:06:29.970 
gonna put it in this slightly smaller

00:06:29.970 --> 00:06:32.540 
gonna put it in this slightly smaller
screen<00:06:30.510> here<00:06:30.920> just<00:06:31.920> want<00:06:32.100> to<00:06:32.160> make<00:06:32.250> sure<00:06:32.280> we

00:06:32.540 --> 00:06:32.550 
screen here just want to make sure we

00:06:32.550 --> 00:06:35.450 
screen here just want to make sure we
get<00:06:32.640> all<00:06:32.700> the<00:06:32.970> seed<00:06:33.240> out<00:06:34.070> sometimes<00:06:35.070> I'll<00:06:35.250> take

00:06:35.450 --> 00:06:35.460 
get all the seed out sometimes I'll take

00:06:35.460 --> 00:06:37.390 
get all the seed out sometimes I'll take
the<00:06:35.610> back<00:06:35.820> of<00:06:35.850> my<00:06:36.120> knuckles<00:06:36.570> and<00:06:36.750> I'll<00:06:36.990> just

00:06:44.670 --> 00:06:44.680 
squeezing a sponge out of that seed then

00:06:44.680 --> 00:06:48.360 
squeezing a sponge out of that seed then
lastly<00:06:45.190> for<00:06:45.760> the<00:06:45.880> drying<00:06:46.210> process<00:06:46.330> I<00:06:47.260> like<00:06:48.190> to

00:06:48.360 --> 00:06:48.370 
lastly for the drying process I like to

00:06:48.370 --> 00:06:51.450 
lastly for the drying process I like to
put<00:06:48.610> my<00:06:48.820> seeds<00:06:49.150> onto<00:06:49.590> ceramic<00:06:50.590> personally<00:06:51.370> if

00:06:51.450 --> 00:06:51.460 
put my seeds onto ceramic personally if

00:06:51.460 --> 00:06:54.000 
put my seeds onto ceramic personally if
I'm<00:06:51.610> doing<00:06:51.850> small<00:06:52.180> batches<00:06:52.449> like<00:06:52.870> this<00:06:53.139> or

bigger trays if I'm doing larger batches
I<00:06:56.340> never<00:06:57.340> put<00:06:57.810> tomato<00:06:58.810> seed<00:06:59.199> or<00:06:59.530> pepper<00:06:59.800> seed

you'll have paper stuck to your seed

00:07:08.139 --> 00:07:12.270 
you'll have paper stuck to your seed
forever<00:07:08.440> a<00:07:09.479> little<00:07:10.479> hit<00:07:10.830> there<00:07:11.830> it<00:07:11.919> is<00:07:12.070> now

this deceit is stuck together sometimes
the<00:07:31.449> seed<00:07:31.660> will<00:07:31.870> dry<00:07:32.380> completely<00:07:33.010> stuck

00:07:33.270 --> 00:07:33.280 
the seed will dry completely stuck

00:07:33.280 --> 00:07:34.439 
the seed will dry completely stuck
together<00:07:33.430> like<00:07:33.789> that<00:07:34.000> you'll<00:07:34.180> have<00:07:34.300> little

together like that you'll have little

00:07:34.449 --> 00:07:37.740 
together like that you'll have little
clods<00:07:34.840> of<00:07:35.020> seed<00:07:35.289> it's<00:07:36.100> not<00:07:36.370> a<00:07:36.400> problem<00:07:36.699> as<00:07:37.479> long

00:07:37.740 --> 00:07:37.750 
clods of seed it's not a problem as long

00:07:37.750 --> 00:07:39.840 
clods of seed it's not a problem as long
as<00:07:37.930> you<00:07:38.080> allow<00:07:38.380> that<00:07:38.560> to<00:07:38.889> thoroughly<00:07:39.130> dry<00:07:39.550> for

00:07:39.840 --> 00:07:39.850 
as you allow that to thoroughly dry for

00:07:39.850 --> 00:07:42.210 
as you allow that to thoroughly dry for
at<00:07:39.940> least<00:07:40.060> three<00:07:40.870> or<00:07:40.960> four<00:07:41.020> days<00:07:41.380> in<00:07:41.680> an<00:07:41.800> airy
