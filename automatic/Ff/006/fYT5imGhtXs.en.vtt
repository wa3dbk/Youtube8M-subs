00:00:26.050 --> 00:00:26.060 
each time we're gonna have to take too

00:00:26.060 --> 00:00:27.310 
each time we're gonna have to take too
many<00:00:26.179> sections<00:00:26.720> it's<00:00:26.900> going<00:00:27.019> to<00:00:27.080> be<00:00:27.169> very

00:00:27.310 --> 00:00:27.320 
many sections it's going to be very

00:00:27.320 --> 00:00:29.560 
many sections it's going to be very
difficult<00:00:27.949> so<00:00:28.400> if<00:00:28.490> you<00:00:28.609> count<00:00:28.910> how<00:00:29.179> many<00:00:29.240> times

00:00:29.560 --> 00:00:29.570

00:00:29.570 --> 00:00:31.989 
difficult so if you count how many times
I<00:00:29.990> open<00:00:30.349> and<00:00:30.470> close<00:00:30.650> the<00:00:30.890> scissor<00:00:31.130> that's<00:00:31.849> how

00:00:31.989 --> 00:00:31.999 
I open and close the scissor that's how

00:00:31.999 --> 00:00:34.060 
I open and close the scissor that's how
many<00:00:32.210> sections<00:00:32.570> you<00:00:32.750> would<00:00:32.900> have<00:00:33.050> to<00:00:33.200> take<00:00:33.440> to

00:00:34.060 --> 00:00:34.070 
many sections you would have to take to

00:00:34.070 --> 00:00:36.670 
many sections you would have to take to
get<00:00:34.190> the<00:00:34.340> hair<00:00:34.520> to<00:00:34.940> this<00:00:35.090> evening<00:00:35.500> okay<00:00:36.500> we're

00:02:50.430 --> 00:02:50.440 
shape so we're starting out this way and

00:02:50.440 --> 00:02:52.020 
shape so we're starting out this way and
then<00:02:50.590> slightly<00:02:50.860> rounding<00:02:51.370> it<00:02:51.489> in<00:02:51.610> towards<00:02:51.910> the
