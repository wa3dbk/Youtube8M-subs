the top take off the paper each skin
barely<00:00:24.539> trim<00:00:24.779> off<00:00:24.930> the<00:00:25.109> root<00:00:25.320> the<00:00:25.740> top<00:00:25.980> of<00:00:26.189> this

00:00:26.240 --> 00:00:26.250 
barely trim off the root the top of this

00:00:26.250 --> 00:00:27.560 
barely trim off the root the top of this
shallot<00:00:26.699> right<00:00:26.820> here<00:00:27.000> could<00:00:27.150> actually<00:00:27.210> get

shallot right here could actually get
trimmed<00:00:27.869> a<00:00:28.080> little<00:00:28.289> bit<00:00:28.500> more<00:00:28.740> and<00:00:29.130> we<00:00:29.220> go

00:00:29.300 --> 00:00:29.310 
trimmed a little bit more and we go

00:00:29.310 --> 00:00:32.659 
trimmed a little bit more and we go
ahead<00:00:29.429> and<00:00:29.670> cut<00:00:29.820> that<00:00:29.970> off<00:00:31.279> and<00:00:32.279> you'll<00:00:32.489> often

00:00:32.659 --> 00:00:32.669 
ahead and cut that off and you'll often

00:00:32.669 --> 00:00:34.190 
ahead and cut that off and you'll often
see<00:00:33.030> that<00:00:33.180> the<00:00:33.239> shallot<00:00:33.690> will<00:00:33.780> either<00:00:33.899> have<00:00:34.170> a

00:00:34.190 --> 00:00:34.200 
see that the shallot will either have a

around<00:00:45.539> the<00:00:45.809> blade<00:00:46.050> I<00:00:46.289> have<00:00:46.739> the<00:00:46.890> root<00:00:47.070> of<00:00:47.190> the

00:00:47.240 --> 00:00:47.250 
around the blade I have the root of the

00:00:47.250 --> 00:00:49.160 
around the blade I have the root of the
shallot<00:00:47.640> pointing<00:00:47.969> away<00:00:48.149> from<00:00:48.390> me<00:00:48.510> and<00:00:49.079> I'm

shallot pointing away from me and I'm

00:00:49.170 --> 00:00:50.810 
shallot pointing away from me and I'm
gonna<00:00:49.289> start<00:00:49.590> to<00:00:49.710> make<00:00:49.829> some<00:00:50.039> parallel<00:00:50.489> cuts

00:00:50.810 --> 00:00:50.820 
gonna start to make some parallel cuts

00:00:50.820 --> 00:00:53.420 
gonna start to make some parallel cuts
trying<00:00:51.719> to<00:00:51.840> get<00:00:51.989> the<00:00:52.140> tip<00:00:52.320> of<00:00:52.469> that<00:00:52.500> knife<00:00:52.770> as

00:00:53.420 --> 00:00:53.430 
trying to get the tip of that knife as

00:00:53.430 --> 00:00:55.790 
trying to get the tip of that knife as
close<00:00:53.850> to<00:00:54.030> that<00:00:54.059> root<00:00:54.750> as<00:00:55.020> I<00:00:55.350> can<00:00:55.590> without

00:00:55.790 --> 00:00:55.800 
close to that root as I can without

00:00:55.800 --> 00:00:57.979 
close to that root as I can without
going<00:00:56.070> all<00:00:56.340> the<00:00:56.460> way<00:00:56.489> through<00:00:56.850> it<00:00:57.030> knife<00:00:57.780> is

00:00:57.979 --> 00:00:57.989 
going all the way through it knife is

00:00:57.989 --> 00:00:59.479 
going all the way through it knife is
gonna<00:00:58.199> wind<00:00:58.379> up<00:00:58.469> leaving<00:00:58.829> my<00:00:58.949> cutting<00:00:59.280> board

00:00:59.479 --> 00:00:59.489 
gonna wind up leaving my cutting board

00:00:59.489 --> 00:01:01.580 
gonna wind up leaving my cutting board
I'm<00:01:00.030> gonna<00:01:00.270> hold<00:01:00.480> on<00:01:00.690> to<00:01:00.809> the<00:01:00.960> shallot<00:01:01.350> with<00:01:01.440> my

00:01:01.580 --> 00:01:01.590 
I'm gonna hold on to the shallot with my

00:01:01.590 --> 00:01:03.709 
I'm gonna hold on to the shallot with my
fingertips<00:01:02.100> curled<00:01:02.430> underneath<00:01:02.730> and<00:01:03.629> I'm

00:01:03.709 --> 00:01:03.719 
fingertips curled underneath and I'm

00:01:03.719 --> 00:01:05.299 
fingertips curled underneath and I'm
gonna<00:01:03.840> start<00:01:04.140> to<00:01:04.260> make<00:01:04.409> some<00:01:04.589> parallel<00:01:05.040> cuts

00:01:05.299 --> 00:01:05.309 
gonna start to make some parallel cuts

00:01:05.309 --> 00:01:08.390 
gonna start to make some parallel cuts
like<00:01:05.519> this<00:01:06.439> making<00:01:07.439> them<00:01:07.560> really<00:01:07.740> nice<00:01:08.010> and

00:01:08.390 --> 00:01:08.400 
like this making them really nice and

00:01:08.400 --> 00:01:14.780 
like this making them really nice and
narrow<00:01:09.090> a<00:01:12.380> broom<00:01:13.380> was<00:01:13.530> typically<00:01:14.159> as<00:01:14.280> an

00:01:14.780 --> 00:01:14.790 
narrow a broom was typically as an

00:01:14.790 --> 00:01:18.469 
narrow a broom was typically as an
eighth<00:01:15.119> of<00:01:15.270> an<00:01:15.390> inch<00:01:15.479> cube<00:01:15.990> or<00:01:16.920> a<00:01:16.950> dice<00:01:17.479> some

00:01:18.469 --> 00:01:18.479 
eighth of an inch cube or a dice some

00:01:18.479 --> 00:01:20.510 
eighth of an inch cube or a dice some
cookbooks<00:01:18.689> may<00:01:19.170> even<00:01:19.470> call<00:01:19.799> for<00:01:20.009> a<00:01:20.040> sixteenth

00:01:20.510 --> 00:01:20.520 
cookbooks may even call for a sixteenth

00:01:20.520 --> 00:01:22.190 
cookbooks may even call for a sixteenth
of<00:01:20.670> an<00:01:20.790> inch<00:01:20.880> it's<00:01:21.119> really<00:01:21.390> gonna<00:01:21.509> depend<00:01:21.750> on

00:01:22.190 --> 00:01:22.200 
of an inch it's really gonna depend on

00:01:22.200 --> 00:01:24.950 
of an inch it's really gonna depend on
the<00:01:22.920> recipe<00:01:23.310> itself<00:01:23.670> so<00:01:24.330> after<00:01:24.600> I<00:01:24.630> wind<00:01:24.869> up

00:01:24.950 --> 00:01:24.960 
the recipe itself so after I wind up

00:01:24.960 --> 00:01:26.719 
the recipe itself so after I wind up
making<00:01:25.170> these<00:01:25.439> parallel<00:01:25.920> cuts<00:01:26.189> you<00:01:26.400> can<00:01:26.430> see

00:01:26.719 --> 00:01:26.729 
making these parallel cuts you can see

00:01:26.729 --> 00:01:28.490 
making these parallel cuts you can see
the<00:01:26.939> root<00:01:27.450> holds<00:01:27.750> all<00:01:27.869> the<00:01:28.020> layers<00:01:28.200> of<00:01:28.439> the

00:01:28.490 --> 00:01:28.500 
the root holds all the layers of the

00:01:28.500 --> 00:01:30.410 
the root holds all the layers of the
shallot<00:01:28.920> together<00:01:29.220> I'm<00:01:29.759> gonna<00:01:29.909> turn<00:01:30.150> to<00:01:30.299> turn

00:01:30.410 --> 00:01:30.420 
shallot together I'm gonna turn to turn

00:01:30.420 --> 00:01:33.380 
shallot together I'm gonna turn to turn
the<00:01:30.600> shallot<00:01:30.990> 90<00:01:31.619> degrees<00:01:31.950> and<00:01:32.250> then<00:01:33.000> go<00:01:33.150> ahead

00:01:33.380 --> 00:01:33.390 
the shallot 90 degrees and then go ahead

00:01:33.390 --> 00:01:37.550 
the shallot 90 degrees and then go ahead
and<00:01:33.509> cut<00:01:33.659> across<00:01:35.810> and<00:01:36.810> let<00:01:36.990> the<00:01:37.140> root<00:01:37.320> no

00:01:37.550 --> 00:01:37.560 
and cut across and let the root no

00:01:37.560 --> 00:01:40.999 
and cut across and let the root no
longer<00:01:38.030> attached<00:01:39.030> these<00:01:40.020> nice<00:01:40.320> little<00:01:40.470> dices

00:01:40.999 --> 00:01:41.009 
longer attached these nice little dices

00:01:41.009 --> 00:01:44.240 
longer attached these nice little dices
start<00:01:41.250> to<00:01:41.340> fall<00:01:41.520> away<00:01:42.229> and<00:01:43.229> that<00:01:43.409> is<00:01:43.619> how<00:01:43.860> you

00:01:44.240 --> 00:01:44.250 
start to fall away and that is how you

00:01:44.250 --> 00:01:48.090 
start to fall away and that is how you
cut<00:01:44.460> a<00:01:44.490> glue<00:01:44.729> Mouse

00:01:48.090 --> 00:01:48.100
