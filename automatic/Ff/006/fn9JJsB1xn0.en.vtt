00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.879
 hello to everyone so today we get 

00:00:01.439 --> 00:00:04.319
 found in a new video enough 

00:00:02.879 --> 00:00:05.790
 original to actually show you 

00:00:04.319 --> 00:00:06.750
 how does it go when I sell a 

00:00:05.790 --> 00:00:08.610
 of my creations 

00:00:06.750 --> 00:00:09.780
 so I hope before this video is going 

00:00:08.610 --> 00:00:13.559
 to please you and I leave you with the 

00:00:09.780 --> 00:00:15.570
 suite so first of all I get a 

00:00:13.559 --> 00:00:17.780
 mail saying that I sold one of my 

00:00:15.570 --> 00:00:17.780
 creations 

00:00:25.650 --> 00:00:30.779
 Then I just confirm the order 

00:00:27.730 --> 00:00:30.779
 on little market 

00:00:39.610 --> 00:00:43.600
 then after taking my creation I 

00:00:41.560 --> 00:00:47.500
 come and take everything to pack so 

00:00:43.600 --> 00:00:49.830
 nice pink paper paper seen a 

00:00:47.500 --> 00:00:49.830
 envelope 

00:00:50.730 --> 00:01:00.379
 my business card to turn off my stamp 

00:00:55.110 --> 00:01:00.379
 2 at vistaprint and but watch and hype 

00:01:00.470 --> 00:01:04.290
 and then I just was worth while including 

00:01:02.699 --> 00:01:06.530
 I'm really trying to make a pretty little 

00:01:04.290 --> 00:01:06.530
 packaging 

00:01:07.610 --> 00:01:12.060
 and so I just split diverchy head of 

00:01:10.500 --> 00:01:14.870
 my choice so it goes best with 

00:01:12.060 --> 00:01:14.870
 packing 

00:01:36.990 --> 00:01:40.680
 but I just slip my little card 

00:01:39.090 --> 00:01:42.750
 flow that I realized on the site 

00:01:40.680 --> 00:01:44.909
 vistaprint and I put my little stamp 

00:01:42.750 --> 00:01:48.390
 on it and so that's so it's up to 

00:01:44.909 --> 00:01:50.250

00:01:48.390 --> 00:01:53.090
