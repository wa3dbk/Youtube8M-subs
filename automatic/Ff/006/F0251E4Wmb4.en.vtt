00:00:06.370 --> 00:00:06.380 
now I know for Leto arms going to be

00:00:06.380 --> 00:00:08.530 
now I know for Leto arms going to be
held<00:00:06.529> in<00:00:06.590> place<00:00:06.740> with<00:00:06.859> the<00:00:07.099> larger<00:00:07.550> 18

the engine may draw engines not going to
draw<00:00:20.869> it<00:00:20.930> because<00:00:21.260> there<00:00:21.470> is<00:00:21.500> a<00:00:21.770> center<00:00:22.220> mount

00:00:22.450 --> 00:00:22.460 
draw it because there is a center mount

00:00:22.460 --> 00:00:24.850 
draw it because there is a center mount
located<00:00:23.360> in<00:00:23.449> the<00:00:23.570> center<00:00:23.930> of<00:00:23.960> the<00:00:24.320> timing

00:01:25.420 --> 00:01:25.430 
the AC lines are that we took loose two

00:01:25.430 --> 00:01:27.670 
the AC lines are that we took loose two
of<00:01:25.640> them<00:01:25.760> set<00:01:26.090> one<00:01:26.390> on<00:01:26.420> top<00:01:26.750> of<00:01:26.810> each<00:01:27.110> other<00:01:27.380> so

00:01:27.670 --> 00:01:27.680 
of them set one on top of each other so

00:01:27.680 --> 00:01:30.400 
of them set one on top of each other so
once<00:01:28.370> you<00:01:28.490> get<00:01:28.610> to<00:01:28.730> those<00:01:28.910> two<00:01:29.210> you've<00:01:29.990> got<00:01:30.020> one

have<00:03:12.550> to<00:03:12.670> take<00:03:12.850> it<00:03:13.000> all<00:03:13.150> the<00:03:13.180> way<00:03:13.240> off

00:03:13.740 --> 00:03:13.750 
have to take it all the way off

00:03:13.750 --> 00:03:16.770 
have to take it all the way off
you<00:03:14.260> would<00:03:14.500> have<00:03:14.800> to<00:03:15.100> unhook<00:03:15.450> connector<00:03:16.450> to<00:03:16.630> it

00:03:16.770 --> 00:03:16.780

an<00:03:47.410> install<00:03:47.860> you<00:03:48.459> actually<00:03:48.850> would<00:03:49.030> look<00:03:49.180> for

00:03:49.380 --> 00:03:49.390 
an install you actually would look for

00:03:49.390 --> 00:03:51.000 
an install you actually would look for
that<00:03:49.540> to<00:03:49.660> see<00:03:49.810> if<00:03:49.870> it<00:03:49.989> there<00:03:50.290> would<00:03:50.650> save<00:03:50.860> you<00:03:50.980> a

00:03:51.000 --> 00:03:51.010 
that to see if it there would save you a

00:03:51.010 --> 00:03:52.470 
that to see if it there would save you a
lot<00:03:51.160> of<00:03:51.220> time<00:03:51.519> with<00:03:51.700> installing<00:03:52.090> the<00:03:52.269> cruise

little funnel v-type area so that's what

00:05:55.600 --> 00:05:56.970 
little funnel v-type area so that's what
you<00:05:55.720> need<00:05:55.870> to<00:05:55.930> pay<00:05:56.080> attention<00:05:56.530> to<00:05:56.680> if<00:05:56.830> you're

00:05:56.970 --> 00:05:56.980 
you need to pay attention to if you're

00:05:56.980 --> 00:05:58.920 
you need to pay attention to if you're
picking<00:05:57.310> up<00:05:57.430> the<00:05:57.490> jacking<00:05:58.240> up<00:05:58.300> the<00:05:58.420> car<00:05:58.600> or

picking up the jacking up the car or
lowering<00:05:59.140> the<00:05:59.320> engine<00:05:59.440> and<00:05:59.740> doesn't<00:05:59.980> want<00:06:00.100> to

00:06:00.150 --> 00:06:00.160 
lowering the engine and doesn't want to

00:06:00.160 --> 00:06:01.920 
lowering the engine and doesn't want to
move<00:06:00.250> properly<00:06:00.700> you<00:06:01.150> pay<00:06:01.390> attention<00:06:01.480> to<00:06:01.810> that

00:06:01.920 --> 00:06:01.930 
move properly you pay attention to that

going to go ahead lift the vehicle or
lower<00:06:06.310> the<00:06:06.550> engine<00:06:06.670> and<00:06:07.360> we're<00:06:07.540> going<00:06:07.660> to<00:06:07.720> work

00:06:07.860 --> 00:06:07.870 
lower the engine and we're going to work

00:06:07.870 --> 00:06:10.770 
lower the engine and we're going to work
on<00:06:08.020> getting<00:06:08.260> this<00:06:08.320> balance<00:06:08.590> off<00:06:09.660> we're<00:06:10.660> going

00:06:10.770 --> 00:06:10.780 
on getting this balance off we're going

00:06:10.780 --> 00:06:12.150 
on getting this balance off we're going
to<00:06:10.840> work<00:06:11.020> on<00:06:11.230> getting<00:06:11.380> that<00:06:11.530> balancer<00:06:12.130> bolt

00:06:12.150 --> 00:06:12.160 
to work on getting that balancer bolt

00:06:12.160 --> 00:06:14.550 
to work on getting that balancer bolt
off<00:06:12.490> now<00:06:12.670> it's<00:06:13.090> actually<00:06:13.300> just<00:06:13.690> a<00:06:13.870> 19

00:06:14.550 --> 00:06:14.560 
off now it's actually just a 19

use<00:06:17.230> an<00:06:17.380> impact<00:06:17.710> you<00:06:17.770> have<00:06:17.950> to<00:06:18.040> worry<00:06:18.250> about

00:06:18.330 --> 00:06:18.340 
use an impact you have to worry about

00:06:18.340 --> 00:06:28.320 
use an impact you have to worry about
the<00:06:18.550> pulley<00:06:18.760> wanting<00:06:19.090> to<00:06:19.150> turn<00:06:19.360> on<00:06:19.540> you<00:06:27.330> now

00:06:28.320 --> 00:06:28.330 
the pulley wanting to turn on you now

00:06:28.330 --> 00:06:30.330 
the pulley wanting to turn on you now
we're<00:06:28.510> going<00:06:28.630> to<00:06:28.690> use<00:06:28.780> a<00:06:28.870> three<00:06:29.380> jaw<00:06:29.590> puller<00:06:29.830> to

00:06:30.330 --> 00:06:30.340 
we're going to use a three jaw puller to

00:06:30.340 --> 00:06:32.010 
we're going to use a three jaw puller to
get<00:06:30.520> in<00:06:30.610> two<00:06:30.700> to<00:06:30.790> three<00:06:30.820> recesses<00:06:31.390> here<00:06:31.780> and

00:06:32.010 --> 00:06:32.020 
get in two to three recesses here and

00:06:32.020 --> 00:06:34.230 
get in two to three recesses here and
we're<00:06:32.470> going<00:06:32.620> to<00:06:32.680> have<00:06:32.830> it<00:06:32.980> an<00:06:33.340> insert<00:06:34.210> that

00:06:34.230 --> 00:06:34.240 
we're going to have it an insert that

00:06:34.240 --> 00:06:36.210 
we're going to have it an insert that
goes<00:06:34.510> in<00:06:34.690> as<00:06:34.810> well<00:06:34.990> because<00:06:35.620> it's<00:06:35.800> actually<00:06:36.160> a

00:06:36.210 --> 00:06:36.220 
goes in as well because it's actually a

00:06:36.220 --> 00:06:37.380 
goes in as well because it's actually a
little<00:06:36.580> bit<00:06:36.700> deeper<00:06:36.940> than<00:06:37.030> what<00:06:37.150> it<00:06:37.300> appears

00:06:37.380 --> 00:06:37.390 
little bit deeper than what it appears

00:06:37.390 --> 00:06:39.180 
little bit deeper than what it appears
so<00:06:38.110> let<00:06:38.230> me<00:06:38.350> go<00:06:38.410> ahead<00:06:38.470> and<00:06:38.560> get<00:06:38.710> that<00:06:38.830> set<00:06:39.040> up

00:06:39.180 --> 00:06:39.190 
so let me go ahead and get that set up

00:06:39.190 --> 00:06:40.830 
so let me go ahead and get that set up
and<00:06:39.340> then<00:06:39.400> we'll<00:06:39.640> get<00:06:39.730> that<00:06:39.790> pulled<00:06:40.120> out<00:06:40.300> now

00:06:40.830 --> 00:06:40.840 
and then we'll get that pulled out now

00:06:40.840 --> 00:06:42.030 
and then we'll get that pulled out now
it's<00:06:41.080> time<00:06:41.230> to<00:06:41.410> go<00:06:41.530> ahead<00:06:41.560> and<00:06:41.800> get<00:06:41.890> this

00:06:42.030 --> 00:06:42.040 
it's time to go ahead and get this

00:06:42.040 --> 00:06:44.010 
it's time to go ahead and get this
pulley<00:06:42.280> off<00:06:42.520> go<00:06:43.030> ahead<00:06:43.150> and<00:06:43.240> get<00:06:43.330> my<00:06:43.450> MPEG<00:06:43.780> on

across times when you will need that
free<00:07:25.990> job<00:07:26.230> holder<00:07:26.910> so<00:07:27.910> with<00:07:28.030> that<00:07:28.180> we've<00:07:28.900> got

00:07:28.920 --> 00:07:28.930 
free job holder so with that we've got

00:07:28.930 --> 00:07:31.950 
free job holder so with that we've got
the<00:07:29.170> pulley<00:07:29.380> off<00:07:29.980> the<00:07:30.520> bouncer<00:07:30.940> off<00:07:31.060> now<00:07:31.750> we're

00:07:31.950 --> 00:07:31.960 
the pulley off the bouncer off now we're

00:07:31.960 --> 00:07:34.020 
the pulley off the bouncer off now we're
going<00:07:32.080> to<00:07:32.200> move<00:07:32.410> on<00:07:32.590> to<00:07:32.620> getting<00:07:33.190> the<00:07:33.610> front

00:07:34.020 --> 00:07:34.030 
going to move on to getting the front

going to move on to getting the front
bracket<00:07:34.420> off<00:07:34.840> I<00:07:35.140> think<00:07:35.560> Prime<00:07:35.830> it's<00:07:36.820> actually

00:07:37.260 --> 00:07:37.270 
bracket off I think Prime it's actually

00:07:37.270 --> 00:07:38.880 
bracket off I think Prime it's actually
up<00:07:37.420> against<00:07:37.780> frame<00:07:37.990> rail<00:07:38.200> where<00:07:38.470> the<00:07:38.590> engine

00:07:38.880 --> 00:07:38.890 
up against frame rail where the engine

00:07:38.890 --> 00:07:40.920 
up against frame rail where the engine
mount<00:07:39.070> went<00:07:39.250> that's<00:07:39.580> actually<00:07:40.030> the<00:07:40.180> mount<00:07:40.570> for

00:07:40.920 --> 00:07:40.930 
mount went that's actually the mount for

mount went that's actually the mount for
the<00:07:40.960> engine<00:07:41.950> mount<00:07:42.880> bolt<00:07:43.180> that<00:07:43.420> we<00:07:43.510> showed

00:07:43.710 --> 00:07:43.720 
the engine mount bolt that we showed

00:07:43.720 --> 00:07:45.720 
the engine mount bolt that we showed
earlier<00:07:43.960> it<00:07:44.710> goes<00:07:44.890> through<00:07:45.160> the<00:07:45.280> frame<00:07:45.490> rail

00:07:45.720 --> 00:07:45.730 
earlier it goes through the frame rail

00:07:45.730 --> 00:07:47.850 
earlier it goes through the frame rail
into<00:07:46.120> this<00:07:46.240> bracket<00:07:47.020> that<00:07:47.140> bolts<00:07:47.470> to<00:07:47.530> the

00:07:47.850 --> 00:07:47.860 
into this bracket that bolts to the

00:07:47.860 --> 00:07:50.250 
into this bracket that bolts to the
block<00:07:48.130> itself<00:07:48.580> that's<00:07:49.360> the<00:07:49.630> bracket<00:07:49.990> we<00:07:50.110> don't

00:07:50.250 --> 00:07:50.260 
block itself that's the bracket we don't

00:07:50.260 --> 00:07:51.900 
block itself that's the bracket we don't
get<00:07:50.410> all<00:07:50.500> the<00:07:50.620> way<00:07:50.770> once<00:07:51.280> we<00:07:51.370> get<00:07:51.580> it<00:07:51.730> out<00:07:51.850> of

get all the way once we get it out of

get all the way once we get it out of
the<00:07:51.970> way<00:07:52.120> we're<00:07:52.750> gonna<00:07:52.930> have<00:07:53.050> access<00:07:53.200> to<00:07:53.590> the

the way we're gonna have access to the
belt
