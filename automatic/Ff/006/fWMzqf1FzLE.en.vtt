00:00:24.740 --> 00:00:24.750 
for you so we'll go through some of the

00:00:24.750 --> 00:00:26.300 
for you so we'll go through some of the
great<00:00:24.779> features<00:00:25.109> on<00:00:25.439> it<00:00:25.560> that's<00:00:26.010> triple

00:00:26.300 --> 00:00:26.310 
great features on it that's triple

00:00:26.310 --> 00:00:28.070 
great features on it that's triple
oscillation<00:00:27.029> what<00:00:27.240> that<00:00:27.390> means<00:00:27.599> it<00:00:27.750> has<00:00:27.869> both

00:00:28.070 --> 00:00:28.080 
oscillation what that means it has both

00:00:28.080 --> 00:00:30.050 
oscillation what that means it has both
the<00:00:28.230> horizontal<00:00:28.470> oscillation<00:00:29.340> from<00:00:29.490> for

00:00:30.050 --> 00:00:30.060 
the horizontal oscillation from for

00:00:30.060 --> 00:00:32.299 
the horizontal oscillation from for
forehand<00:00:30.570> and<00:00:30.869> backhand<00:00:31.050> but<00:00:31.740> it<00:00:31.859> also<00:00:32.009> has

00:00:32.299 --> 00:00:32.309 
forehand and backhand but it also has

00:00:32.309 --> 00:00:34.490 
forehand and backhand but it also has
horizontal<00:00:32.700> ICV<00:00:33.390> vertical<00:00:33.840> oscillation<00:00:33.930> well

00:00:34.490 --> 00:00:34.500 
horizontal ICV vertical oscillation well

00:00:34.500 --> 00:00:36.290 
horizontal ICV vertical oscillation well
that<00:00:34.620> means<00:00:34.770> up<00:00:35.010> and<00:00:35.160> back<00:00:35.340> and<00:00:36.000> why<00:00:36.149> it's

00:00:36.290 --> 00:00:36.300 
that means up and back and why it's

00:00:36.300 --> 00:00:37.880 
that means up and back and why it's
called<00:00:36.480> triple<00:00:36.690> oscillation<00:00:37.440> is<00:00:37.559> the<00:00:37.680> fact

00:00:37.880 --> 00:00:37.890 
called triple oscillation is the fact

00:00:37.890 --> 00:00:40.010 
called triple oscillation is the fact
that<00:00:38.010> it<00:00:38.190> can<00:00:38.340> go<00:00:38.520> it<00:00:38.940> can<00:00:39.149> use<00:00:39.300> all<00:00:39.540> both

00:00:40.010 --> 00:00:40.020 
that it can go it can use all both

00:00:40.020 --> 00:00:42.319 
that it can go it can use all both
horizontal<00:00:40.710> and<00:00:40.739> vertical<00:00:41.340> oscillation<00:00:41.820> at

00:00:42.319 --> 00:00:42.329 
horizontal and vertical oscillation at

00:00:42.329 --> 00:00:44.479 
horizontal and vertical oscillation at
the<00:00:42.450> same<00:00:42.660> time<00:00:42.930> so<00:00:43.500> you<00:00:43.559> got<00:00:43.980> it<00:00:44.160> going

00:00:44.479 --> 00:00:44.489 
the same time so you got it going

00:00:44.489 --> 00:00:46.340 
the same time so you got it going
forehand<00:00:45.000> backhand<00:00:45.239> but<00:00:45.690> you<00:00:45.780> also<00:00:45.930> got<00:00:46.170> it

00:00:46.340 --> 00:00:46.350 
forehand backhand but you also got it

00:00:46.350 --> 00:00:48.590 
forehand backhand but you also got it
going<00:00:46.590> up<00:00:46.739> back<00:00:47.219> kind<00:00:47.820> of<00:00:47.850> like<00:00:48.030> a<00:00:48.059> player<00:00:48.329> mode

00:00:48.590 --> 00:00:48.600 
going up back kind of like a player mode

00:00:48.600 --> 00:00:49.910 
going up back kind of like a player mode
a<00:00:48.629> little<00:00:48.960> bit<00:00:49.110> so<00:00:49.469> that's<00:00:49.559> the<00:00:49.739> triple

00:00:49.910 --> 00:00:49.920 
a little bit so that's the triple

00:00:49.920 --> 00:00:51.080 
a little bit so that's the triple
oscillation<00:00:50.579> for<00:00:50.820> you

00:00:51.080 --> 00:00:51.090 
oscillation for you

00:00:51.090 --> 00:00:52.520 
oscillation for you
you<00:00:51.360> also<00:00:51.510> have<00:00:51.690> ground<00:00:51.960> stroke<00:00:52.230> the<00:00:52.350> lob

00:00:52.520 --> 00:00:52.530 
you also have ground stroke the lob

00:00:52.530 --> 00:00:54.020 
you also have ground stroke the lob
capability<00:00:53.250> and<00:00:53.340> what<00:00:53.430> that<00:00:53.579> means<00:00:53.789> is<00:00:54.000> that

00:00:54.020 --> 00:00:54.030 
capability and what that means is that

00:00:54.030 --> 00:00:56.389 
capability and what that means is that
the<00:00:54.570> ball<00:00:54.750> machine<00:00:54.899> can<00:00:55.260> actually<00:00:56.039> do<00:00:56.129> ground

00:00:56.389 --> 00:00:56.399 
the ball machine can actually do ground

00:00:56.399 --> 00:00:58.250 
the ball machine can actually do ground
strokes<00:00:56.730> but<00:00:57.000> it<00:00:57.090> could<00:00:57.210> also<00:00:57.329> do<00:00:57.629> lobs<00:00:57.960> for

00:00:58.250 --> 00:00:58.260 
strokes but it could also do lobs for

00:00:58.260 --> 00:00:59.630 
strokes but it could also do lobs for
you<00:00:58.410> so<00:00:58.559> overheads<00:00:58.980> for<00:00:59.100> you<00:00:59.309> all<00:00:59.430> the<00:00:59.550> way<00:00:59.609> up

00:00:59.630 --> 00:00:59.640 
you so overheads for you all the way up

00:00:59.640 --> 00:01:02.299 
you so overheads for you all the way up
to<00:00:59.879> sixty<00:01:00.210> degree<00:01:00.510> elevation<00:01:00.660> for<00:01:01.620> you<00:01:01.739> and

00:01:02.299 --> 00:01:02.309 
to sixty degree elevation for you and

00:01:02.309 --> 00:01:04.579 
to sixty degree elevation for you and
then<00:01:02.430> you<00:01:02.550> have<00:01:02.730> the<00:01:03.600> capability<00:01:04.110> of<00:01:04.170> going<00:01:04.290> up

00:01:04.579 --> 00:01:04.589 
then you have the capability of going up

00:01:04.589 --> 00:01:06.530 
then you have the capability of going up
to<00:01:04.769> 80<00:01:05.129> miles<00:01:05.430> per<00:01:05.640> hour<00:01:05.909> so<00:01:06.299> if<00:01:06.420> you're

00:01:06.530 --> 00:01:06.540 
to 80 miles per hour so if you're

00:01:06.540 --> 00:01:08.000 
to 80 miles per hour so if you're
looking<00:01:06.630> for<00:01:06.930> something<00:01:07.110> that's<00:01:07.619> coming<00:01:07.830> at

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:08.010 
looking for something that's coming at

00:01:08.010 --> 00:01:09.590 
looking for something that's coming at
you<00:01:08.130> pretty<00:01:08.220> quickly<00:01:08.549> 80<00:01:08.850> miles<00:01:09.119> per<00:01:09.299> hour<00:01:09.390> is

00:01:09.590 --> 00:01:09.600 
you pretty quickly 80 miles per hour is

00:01:09.600 --> 00:01:11.300 
you pretty quickly 80 miles per hour is
gonna<00:01:09.810> be<00:01:09.869> pretty<00:01:10.080> quick<00:01:10.260> for<00:01:10.530> you<00:01:10.680> it<00:01:11.159> also

00:01:11.300 --> 00:01:11.310 
gonna be pretty quick for you it also

00:01:11.310 --> 00:01:12.950 
gonna be pretty quick for you it also
has<00:01:11.490> enhanced<00:01:11.790> spin<00:01:12.090> control<00:01:12.299> so<00:01:12.689> what<00:01:12.810> that

00:01:12.950 --> 00:01:12.960 
has enhanced spin control so what that

00:01:12.960 --> 00:01:15.730 
has enhanced spin control so what that
has<00:01:13.020> the<00:01:13.320> capability<00:01:13.439> in<00:01:13.979> doing<00:01:14.280> is<00:01:14.729> both

00:01:15.730 --> 00:01:15.740 
has the capability in doing is both

00:01:15.740 --> 00:01:18.200 
has the capability in doing is both
topspin<00:01:16.740> and<00:01:16.890> also<00:01:17.220> backspin<00:01:17.820> so<00:01:18.000> you<00:01:18.090> can

00:01:18.200 --> 00:01:18.210 
topspin and also backspin so you can

00:01:18.210 --> 00:01:19.640 
topspin and also backspin so you can
have<00:01:18.299> both<00:01:18.450> the<00:01:18.600> slice<00:01:18.900> and<00:01:18.930> also<00:01:19.380> have<00:01:19.500> that

00:01:19.640 --> 00:01:19.650 
have both the slice and also have that

00:01:19.650 --> 00:01:21.980 
have both the slice and also have that
forehand<00:01:20.189> topspin<00:01:20.670> playing<00:01:21.540> out<00:01:21.720> and<00:01:21.900> this

00:01:21.980 --> 00:01:21.990 
forehand topspin playing out and this

00:01:21.990 --> 00:01:23.719 
forehand topspin playing out and this
can<00:01:22.049> go<00:01:22.290> on<00:01:22.320> all<00:01:22.710> at<00:01:22.830> the<00:01:22.920> same<00:01:23.100> time<00:01:23.159> which<00:01:23.700> is

00:01:23.719 --> 00:01:23.729 
can go on all at the same time which is

00:01:23.729 --> 00:01:26.330 
can go on all at the same time which is
a<00:01:23.850> great<00:01:24.090> feature<00:01:24.330> to<00:01:24.570> have<00:01:24.630> so<00:01:25.350> it's<00:01:26.189> also

00:01:26.330 --> 00:01:26.340 
a great feature to have so it's also

00:01:26.340 --> 00:01:28.969 
a great feature to have so it's also
very<00:01:26.460> portable<00:01:26.909> does<00:01:27.360> hold<00:01:27.540> up<00:01:27.689> to<00:01:27.869> 150<00:01:28.619> balls

00:01:28.969 --> 00:01:28.979 
very portable does hold up to 150 balls

feet actually turns the ball machine on

00:01:53.399 --> 00:01:55.460 
feet actually turns the ball machine on
and<00:01:53.640> the<00:01:54.030> sweep<00:01:54.329> is<00:01:54.509> actually<00:01:54.899> in<00:01:55.020> the<00:01:55.140> on<00:01:55.259> and

00:01:55.460 --> 00:01:55.470 
and the sweep is actually in the on and

00:01:55.470 --> 00:01:57.649 
and the sweep is actually in the on and
on<00:01:55.560> off<00:01:55.920> switch<00:01:56.399> for<00:01:56.430> the<00:01:56.670> triple<00:01:57.030> oscillation
