00:03:14.260 --> 00:03:15.660 
start cracking and it's you can kind of
see<00:03:14.410> that<00:03:14.620> it's<00:03:14.740> a<00:03:14.770> little<00:03:14.800> bit<00:03:15.070> of<00:03:15.220> cracking

00:03:15.660 --> 00:03:15.670 
see that it's a little bit of cracking

00:03:15.670 --> 00:03:18.210 
see that it's a little bit of cracking
not<00:03:16.240> very<00:03:16.450> much<00:03:16.600> though<00:03:16.980> so<00:03:17.980> I'm<00:03:18.040> gonna<00:03:18.100> leave

00:03:18.210 --> 00:03:18.220 
not very much though so I'm gonna leave

00:03:18.220 --> 00:03:19.680 
not very much though so I'm gonna leave
it<00:03:18.310> on<00:03:18.400> for<00:03:18.459> 15<00:03:18.940> minutes<00:03:19.150> and<00:03:19.330> then<00:03:19.390> i<00:03:19.570> will

00:03:19.680 --> 00:03:19.690 
it on for 15 minutes and then i will

00:03:19.690 --> 00:03:21.170 
it on for 15 minutes and then i will
show<00:03:19.870> you<00:03:19.930> how<00:03:20.110> i<00:03:20.140> take<00:03:20.440> it<00:03:20.530> off<00:03:20.650> and<00:03:20.980> then

00:03:21.170 --> 00:03:21.180 
show you how i take it off and then

00:03:21.180 --> 00:03:25.010 
show you how i take it off and then
we'll<00:03:22.180> go<00:03:22.300> from<00:03:22.420> there<00:03:22.480> see<00:03:23.170> a<00:03:23.200> little<00:03:23.410> bit

00:03:25.010 --> 00:03:25.020 
we'll go from there see a little bit

00:03:25.020 --> 00:03:28.470 
we'll go from there see a little bit
okay<00:03:26.020> so<00:03:26.470> now<00:03:26.890> it<00:03:27.130> has<00:03:27.280> been<00:03:27.459> 15<00:03:27.940> minutes<00:03:28.120> and

00:03:28.470 --> 00:03:28.480 
okay so now it has been 15 minutes and

00:03:28.480 --> 00:03:32.300 
okay so now it has been 15 minutes and
it<00:03:29.200> has<00:03:29.950> begun<00:03:30.310> to<00:03:30.910> start<00:03:31.239> cracking<00:03:31.810> and

00:03:32.300 --> 00:03:32.310 
it has begun to start cracking and

00:03:32.310 --> 00:03:35.190 
it has begun to start cracking and

00:03:41.640 --> 00:03:41.650 
it pull in mean it's a good tight so I'm
