really Bertha is being absorbed by

00:03:04.599 --> 00:03:07.530 
really Bertha is being absorbed by
Andrew<00:03:05.349> and<00:03:05.530> here<00:03:05.620> comes<00:03:05.829> clearance<00:03:06.430> and<00:03:07.329> down

00:03:07.530 --> 00:03:07.540 
Andrew and here comes clearance and down

below that we're in between everything

00:03:09.730 --> 00:03:11.789 
below that we're in between everything
so<00:03:10.239> again<00:03:11.019> sunday<00:03:11.379> should<00:03:11.530> be<00:03:11.590> a<00:03:11.620> pretty

much here but we'll look at the O's Iran

00:03:44.799 --> 00:03:47.699 
much here but we'll look at the O's Iran
of<00:03:44.979> the<00:03:45.069> GFS<00:03:45.729> and<00:03:46.000> you<00:03:46.060> can<00:03:46.239> see<00:03:46.449> that<00:03:46.680> run<00:03:47.680> was

00:03:47.699 --> 00:03:47.709 
of the GFS and you can see that run was

much more aggressive with snow here on

of<00:04:05.199> that<00:04:05.319> so<00:04:05.439> that<00:04:05.590> would<00:04:05.709> be<00:04:05.739> mostly<00:04:06.129> rain

00:04:06.479 --> 00:04:06.489 
of that so that would be mostly rain

00:04:06.489 --> 00:04:08.789 
of that so that would be mostly rain
from<00:04:07.449> Birmingham<00:04:07.900> South<00:04:08.199> but<00:04:08.470> look<00:04:08.620> at<00:04:08.709> the

00:04:08.789 --> 00:04:08.799 
from Birmingham South but look at the

00:04:08.799 --> 00:04:11.729 
from Birmingham South but look at the
Canadian<00:04:09.599> it's<00:04:10.599> got<00:04:10.750> the<00:04:10.870> surface<00:04:11.229> low<00:04:11.439> really

00:04:11.729 --> 00:04:11.739 
Canadian it's got the surface low really

00:04:11.739 --> 00:04:14.550 
Canadian it's got the surface low really

thickness<00:04:14.739> value<00:04:15.220> near<00:04:15.400> montgomery<00:04:15.549> and<00:04:15.970> that

00:04:16.080 --> 00:04:16.090 
thickness value near montgomery and that

00:04:16.090 --> 00:04:22.200 
thickness value near montgomery and that
would<00:04:16.239> suggest<00:04:16.419> a<00:04:17.820> whopper<00:04:18.820> of<00:04:20.370> a<00:04:21.370> snow<00:04:22.029> event

00:04:22.200 --> 00:04:22.210 
would suggest a whopper of a snow event

00:04:22.210 --> 00:04:25.170 
would suggest a whopper of a snow event
here<00:04:22.889> and<00:04:23.889> as<00:04:24.099> we<00:04:24.219> all<00:04:24.250> know<00:04:24.400> and<00:04:24.880> we've

00:04:25.170 --> 00:04:25.180 
here and as we all know and we've

00:04:25.180 --> 00:04:26.370 
here and as we all know and we've
mentioned<00:04:25.389> it<00:04:25.539> here<00:04:25.690> many<00:04:25.870> times<00:04:25.960> the

00:04:27.540 --> 00:04:27.550 
canadian has performed

00:04:27.550 --> 00:04:29.279 
canadian has performed
better<00:04:27.909> than<00:04:28.180> the<00:04:28.270> other<00:04:28.449> models<00:04:28.900> and<00:04:29.080> winter

00:04:29.279 --> 00:04:29.289 
better than the other models and winter

00:04:29.289 --> 00:04:32.129 
better than the other models and winter
weather<00:04:29.440> systems<00:04:29.919> this<00:04:30.129> season<00:04:30.539> but<00:04:31.539> we're

00:04:32.129 --> 00:04:32.139 
weather systems this season but we're

00:04:32.139 --> 00:04:33.689 
weather systems this season but we're
not<00:04:32.169> comfortable<00:04:32.770> making<00:04:32.860> a<00:04:33.190> specific

00:04:33.689 --> 00:04:33.699 
not comfortable making a specific

00:04:33.699 --> 00:04:35.430 
not comfortable making a specific
forecast<00:04:34.150> at<00:04:34.330> this<00:04:34.479> point<00:04:34.720> I<00:04:34.870> don't<00:04:34.930> think<00:04:35.199> it

00:04:35.430 --> 00:04:35.440 
forecast at this point I don't think it

00:04:35.440 --> 00:04:37.830 
forecast at this point I don't think it
makes<00:04:35.620> sense<00:04:35.770> we<00:04:36.580> need<00:04:36.789> to<00:04:36.879> get<00:04:37.000> Bertha<00:04:37.539> out<00:04:37.690> of

00:04:37.830 --> 00:04:37.840 
makes sense we need to get Bertha out of

00:04:37.840 --> 00:04:39.360 
makes sense we need to get Bertha out of
here<00:04:37.990> before<00:04:38.110> we<00:04:38.349> can<00:04:38.500> focus<00:04:38.680> on<00:04:38.979> this<00:04:39.159> one

00:04:39.360 --> 00:04:39.370 
here before we can focus on this one

00:04:39.370 --> 00:04:42.149 
here before we can focus on this one
which<00:04:39.580> what<00:04:39.819> we<00:04:39.909> call<00:04:40.090> Clarence<00:04:40.599> so<00:04:41.560> once<00:04:41.979> the

00:04:42.149 --> 00:04:42.159 
which what we call Clarence so once the

00:04:42.159 --> 00:04:44.100 
which what we call Clarence so once the
shortwave<00:04:42.490> is<00:04:42.759> out<00:04:42.909> of<00:04:42.940> here<00:04:43.270> tomorrow

00:04:44.100 --> 00:04:44.110 
shortwave is out of here tomorrow

00:04:44.110 --> 00:04:47.460 
shortwave is out of here tomorrow
morning<00:04:45.210> Saturday<00:04:46.210> evening<00:04:46.569> into<00:04:46.750> Sunday<00:04:46.960> we

00:04:47.460 --> 00:04:47.470 
morning Saturday evening into Sunday we

00:04:47.470 --> 00:04:49.320 
morning Saturday evening into Sunday we
should<00:04:47.740> have<00:04:47.889> better<00:04:48.129> clarity<00:04:48.729> on<00:04:48.819> this<00:04:49.150> I

00:04:49.320 --> 00:04:49.330 
should have better clarity on this I

00:04:49.330 --> 00:04:51.089 
should have better clarity on this I
still<00:04:49.569> think<00:04:49.840> this<00:04:49.960> has<00:04:50.139> great<00:04:50.409> potential<00:04:50.830> to

00:04:51.089 --> 00:04:51.099 
still think this has great potential to

00:04:51.099 --> 00:04:53.219 
still think this has great potential to
lay<00:04:51.610> down<00:04:51.639> a<00:04:51.879> strip<00:04:52.449> of<00:04:52.569> heavier<00:04:52.870> snow

00:04:53.219 --> 00:04:53.229 
lay down a strip of heavier snow

00:04:53.229 --> 00:04:55.909 
lay down a strip of heavier snow
somewhere<00:04:53.530> across<00:04:54.370> the<00:04:54.669> southern<00:04:54.879> states

00:04:55.909 --> 00:04:55.919 
somewhere across the southern states

00:04:55.919 --> 00:04:58.409 
somewhere across the southern states
this<00:04:56.919> would<00:04:57.129> suggest<00:04:57.250> it<00:04:57.699> would<00:04:57.819> be<00:04:57.940> Jackson

00:04:58.409 --> 00:04:58.419 
this would suggest it would be Jackson

00:04:58.419 --> 00:05:04.439 
this would suggest it would be Jackson
Birmingham<00:04:58.990> in<00:04:59.219> Rome<00:05:00.219> Georgia<00:05:02.069> but<00:05:03.120> it<00:05:04.120> might

00:05:04.439 --> 00:05:04.449 
Birmingham in Rome Georgia but it might

00:05:04.449 --> 00:05:06.749 
Birmingham in Rome Georgia but it might
be<00:05:04.479> nashville<00:05:05.379> or<00:05:05.500> Knoxville<00:05:06.009> in<00:05:06.159> Memphis<00:05:06.550> it

00:05:06.749 --> 00:05:06.759 
be nashville or Knoxville in Memphis it

00:05:06.759 --> 00:05:09.719 
be nashville or Knoxville in Memphis it
might<00:05:07.150> be<00:05:07.360> all<00:05:07.569> rain<00:05:07.900> here<00:05:08.460> nobody<00:05:09.460> knows<00:05:09.699> that

00:05:09.719 --> 00:05:09.729 
might be all rain here nobody knows that

00:05:09.729 --> 00:05:11.100 
might be all rain here nobody knows that
the<00:05:09.969> space<00:05:10.210> of<00:05:10.419> the<00:05:10.479> game<00:05:10.690> but<00:05:10.870> again

00:05:11.100 --> 00:05:11.110 
the space of the game but again

00:05:11.110 --> 00:05:13.469 
the space of the game but again
considering<00:05:11.620> the<00:05:11.889> past<00:05:12.610> performance<00:05:13.270> of<00:05:13.419> the

00:05:13.469 --> 00:05:13.479 
considering the past performance of the

00:05:13.479 --> 00:05:14.610 
considering the past performance of the
Canadian<00:05:13.960> you<00:05:14.110> have<00:05:14.229> to<00:05:14.349> give<00:05:14.469> it<00:05:14.590> some

00:05:14.610 --> 00:05:14.620 
Canadian you have to give it some

00:05:14.620 --> 00:05:17.459 
Canadian you have to give it some
respect<00:05:15.330> so<00:05:16.330> again<00:05:16.930> for<00:05:17.169> now<00:05:17.259> we're<00:05:17.440> just

00:05:17.459 --> 00:05:17.469 
respect so again for now we're just

00:05:17.469 --> 00:05:19.050 
respect so again for now we're just
going<00:05:17.710> to<00:05:17.740> mention<00:05:17.889> colder<00:05:18.430> with<00:05:18.580> a<00:05:18.610> chance<00:05:18.909> of

00:05:19.050 --> 00:05:19.060 
going to mention colder with a chance of

00:05:19.060 --> 00:05:21.959 
going to mention colder with a chance of
rain<00:05:19.120> or<00:05:19.629> snow<00:05:19.780> on<00:05:20.349> Tuesday<00:05:20.889> and<00:05:21.159> by<00:05:21.819> the<00:05:21.879> time
