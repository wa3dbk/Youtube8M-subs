00:00:17.120 --> 00:00:21.250
 car 

00:00:19.250 --> 00:00:21.250
 Hmm 

00:00:23.480 --> 00:00:27.460
 Goon 

00:00:25.140 --> 00:00:30.699
 Hello soon it is a good 

00:00:27.460 --> 00:00:34.390
 You are currently playing in a doubles game 

00:00:30.699 --> 00:00:37.140
 Or I this was not the de-been Soma 

00:00:34.390 --> 00:00:39.740
 And I want to be able to win more 

00:00:37.140 --> 00:00:42.470
 I want to buy out one on the field 

00:00:39.740 --> 00:00:45.300
 I do not bother the mud to the par 

00:00:42.470 --> 00:00:49.750
 There is a partner who can not win by all means, I always regret it 

00:00:45.300 --> 00:00:53.390
 If you feel that way I can help 

00:00:49.750 --> 00:00:57.250
 Explaining why the top and so etm 

00:00:53.390 --> 00:00:57.250
 Please concentrate and watch the part 

00:00:58.270 --> 00:01:04.790
 I'm now as it is now two penis classics three times 

00:01:03.160 --> 00:01:07.030
 There is none 

00:01:04.790 --> 00:01:08.940
 It has become Karuizawa International Te and water 

00:01:07.030 --> 00:01:11.870
 From 2009 

00:01:08.940 --> 00:01:11.870
 It is four years we 

00:01:12.130 --> 00:01:18.659
 We won the 2010 US Open for relief 

00:01:16.490 --> 00:01:21.070
 And the largest in the country 

00:01:18.659 --> 00:01:26.360
 It contains a Sugeshi Tei to the opportunity of easy 

00:01:21.070 --> 00:01:31.640
 There you have a duplicate number of 2011 12 years 

00:01:26.360 --> 00:01:33.320
 The stage body is so with this white child cut in one and what is said to be common grass is one set 

00:01:31.640 --> 00:01:35.500
 Body formation called month 

00:01:33.320 --> 00:01:39.280
 There are so many things you can do 

00:01:35.500 --> 00:01:42.080
 When it comes to me, I feel a little upset and lose immediately 

00:01:39.280 --> 00:01:46.880
 Will be won eaves far also become 

00:01:42.080 --> 00:01:48.650
 So come become necessary is really a tactic to win stable 

00:01:46.880 --> 00:01:52.899
 I will go to the reason 

00:01:48.650 --> 00:01:56.200
 So I have been the key point is-weak coordination sphere 

00:01:52.899 --> 00:02:02.380
 It is stable and is in fact to be weak Do not Yes today 

00:01:56.200 --> 00:02:05.840
 Let alone Tsuiteki ball in that sort of a body that can distribute to reverse high school you would like movements of the opposing 

00:02:02.380 --> 00:02:08.810
 Constant has the potential to win the game 

00:02:05.840 --> 00:02:16.400
 In fact it is my refinement 

00:02:08.810 --> 00:02:19.300
 Betiramu in the war at the provincial tournament in Saitama Prefecture want to be winning at Tokyo open live towards nature 

00:02:16.400 --> 00:02:19.300
 Some people are 

00:02:19.770 --> 00:02:25.300
 You're If it is what kind of thing thing called here So Pina Haidama 

00:02:24.060 --> 00:02:28.020
 The place is explained 

00:02:25.300 --> 00:02:31.030
 Well, start watching the board here too 

00:02:28.020 --> 00:02:33.550
 But some objects, for example 

00:02:31.030 --> 00:02:35.160
 Thank volley I is not all 

00:02:33.550 --> 00:02:37.780
 Everyone 

00:02:35.160 --> 00:02:40.420
 That way their balls stand up a little 

00:02:37.780 --> 00:02:43.569
 Come it every year and it 's a real shit 

00:02:40.420 --> 00:02:45.600
 Let's assume this way, of course the line 

00:02:43.569 --> 00:02:48.350
 The player during this time 

00:02:45.600 --> 00:02:48.350
 The ball and Lee 

00:02:49.230 --> 00:02:56.520
 Then there will be an empty space in the middle, so I will return the ball back 

00:02:54.060 --> 00:02:58.330
 Naturally go to jail with one manda 

00:02:56.520 --> 00:03:02.490
 What is hygiene? 

00:02:58.330 --> 00:03:06.000
 However, each member should naturally read this one too 

00:03:02.490 --> 00:03:11.540
 I do not want to take this thing in the middle for a moment 

00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:15.610
 It is very high with feeling that comes to move the ball with the ball in the middle 

00:03:11.540 --> 00:03:15.610
 That's right , 睦 page 

00:03:16.370 --> 00:03:22.990
 This fall station method is a ball that has been openly forecasting from the beginning and has done a thousand meals 

00:03:22.010 --> 00:03:27.069
 The 

00:03:22.990 --> 00:03:32.109
 Was Mashi if carried by expansion in here from 

00:03:27.069 --> 00:03:33.400
 In anticipation of such opponent's movement and where it would be in open space 

00:03:32.109 --> 00:03:36.470
 It will be distributed 

00:03:33.400 --> 00:03:42.710
 Jerk's allocation and I can do it now 

00:03:36.470 --> 00:03:44.270
 I 've always read the other party, and I will distribute the spray and earnestly and come straight again 

00:03:42.710 --> 00:03:45.930
 Let me think of it 

00:03:44.270 --> 00:03:50.350
 I can pull out the middle 

00:03:45.930 --> 00:03:53.190
 The other party makes it difficult to move in the corner and creates a bundling development 

00:03:50.350 --> 00:03:57.319
 Movement itself of the partner each other on their own 

00:03:53.190 --> 00:04:03.139
 We will consider this Well is For example the Puna distribution sphere 

00:03:57.319 --> 00:04:06.970
 In this way , you are the game that you are in, by getting a weak distribution 

00:04:03.139 --> 00:04:11.200
 I think I'll be back in time and become one of the songs 

00:04:06.970 --> 00:04:16.650
 Well, I will introduce various other patterns in dvd . 

00:04:11.200 --> 00:04:16.650
 In we thought that I would like you to go to a woman I own it is attached to the undergrowth only 

00:04:17.380 --> 00:04:25.170
 As you have seen so far, how to win the game Explanation of d 

00:04:22.120 --> 00:04:28.520
 N Teru But it is that I wanted to tell you I am the best 

00:04:25.170 --> 00:04:32.900
 And and or game to dm 2000 also fun 

00:04:28.520 --> 00:04:34.569
 Become face fun every day does not do anything before corresponds to poor me 

00:04:32.900 --> 00:04:37.280
 It's a thing Tteyuu 

00:04:34.569 --> 00:04:41.150
 I also I is about after all college 

00:04:37.280 --> 00:04:45.890
 I had never given up on tennis and gave up 

00:04:41.150 --> 00:04:46.810
 However there was a connection there and I decided to go to a short-term study abroad program submitted by Australia . 

00:04:45.890 --> 00:04:51.340
 but 

00:04:46.810 --> 00:04:54.400
 So it's really fun and I enjoy buying points to win the water 

00:04:51.340 --> 00:04:58.509
 I was allowed to learn to 

00:04:54.400 --> 00:05:00.969
 Especially in Doubles, while enjoying communication itself with your partner 

00:04:58.509 --> 00:05:06.339
 It's Tan learned and say whether 

00:05:00.969 --> 00:05:11.360
 It because the because the importance of communication has been great is my life + 

00:05:06.339 --> 00:05:16.849
 It has been described in the deeply is I of this agreement for 

00:05:11.360 --> 00:05:17.509
 Yes this is good This pill is that I think I need to double life 

00:05:16.849 --> 00:05:19.740
 all 

00:05:17.509 --> 00:05:24.120
 We were allowed to Tsumekome 

00:05:19.740 --> 00:05:25.710
 Then imagine that such a thing if I have a look also become It is by all means 

00:05:24.120 --> 00:05:27.699
 I would like to receive 

00:05:25.710 --> 00:05:30.350
 I have never bought it before 

00:05:27.699 --> 00:05:36.260
 To face each other in the game 

00:05:30.350 --> 00:05:41.450
 And is it to use-weak coordination sphere whether to dominate the item movement and game 

00:05:36.260 --> 00:05:44.920
 It is smart to have a handshake with the opponent and ending the match it is marked with care 

00:05:41.450 --> 00:05:48.040
 That kind of preside over at night with my partner 

00:05:44.920 --> 00:05:51.480
 Please try to be all means reality it is the music 

00:05:48.040 --> 00:05:51.480
 Let's do our best with me 

00:05:52.350 --> 00:05:56.529

00:05:54.530 --> 00:05:59.339
