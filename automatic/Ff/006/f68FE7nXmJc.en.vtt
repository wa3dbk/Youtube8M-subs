well if I were to have to give you an

00:02:15.930 --> 00:02:17.780 
well if I were to have to give you an
answer<00:02:16.410> on<00:02:16.650> that<00:02:16.769> I<00:02:17.220> would<00:02:17.489> have<00:02:17.580> to<00:02:17.670> go<00:02:17.760> with

00:02:17.780 --> 00:02:17.790 
answer on that I would have to go with

00:02:17.790 --> 00:02:20.059 
answer on that I would have to go with
emus<00:02:18.300> because<00:02:18.569> I<00:02:18.629> think<00:02:18.690> that<00:02:18.989> a<00:02:19.019> fastest<00:02:19.620> bird

00:02:20.059 --> 00:02:20.069 
emus because I think that a fastest bird

00:02:20.069 --> 00:02:22.580 
emus because I think that a fastest bird
like<00:02:20.580> the<00:02:21.150> fastest<00:02:21.599> bird<00:02:21.780> in<00:02:22.080> the<00:02:22.110> whole<00:02:22.349> world

00:02:22.580 --> 00:02:22.590 
like the fastest bird in the whole world

00:02:22.590 --> 00:02:24.110 
like the fastest bird in the whole world
I<00:02:22.860> think<00:02:23.010> they<00:02:23.099> can<00:02:23.220> run<00:02:23.310> like<00:02:23.459> 40<00:02:23.819> miles<00:02:23.970> per

00:02:24.110 --> 00:02:24.120 
I think they can run like 40 miles per

00:02:24.120 --> 00:02:25.729 
I think they can run like 40 miles per
hour<00:02:24.300> something<00:02:24.750> so<00:02:25.140> if<00:02:25.290> you<00:02:25.410> know<00:02:25.500> that's

00:02:25.729 --> 00:02:25.739 
hour something so if you know that's

00:02:25.739 --> 00:02:27.199 
hour something so if you know that's
like<00:02:25.890> driving<00:02:26.069> a<00:02:26.250> car<00:02:26.280> if<00:02:26.580> you<00:02:26.640> get<00:02:26.760> that<00:02:26.849> EMU

00:02:29.030 --> 00:02:29.040 
up to like max velocity max speed I

00:02:29.040 --> 00:02:30.440 
up to like max velocity max speed I
think's<00:02:29.550> booking<00:02:29.879> it<00:02:29.970> you're<00:02:30.090> going<00:02:30.209> to<00:02:30.269> work
