00:00:54.759 --> 00:00:54.769 
get on with which let's face it in 99%

00:00:54.769 --> 00:00:57.009 
get on with which let's face it in 99%
of<00:00:54.830> the<00:00:54.979> time<00:00:55.189> ease<00:00:55.760> exactly<00:00:56.390> what<00:00:56.570> you<00:00:56.809> need

00:00:57.009 --> 00:00:57.019 
of the time ease exactly what you need

00:00:57.019 --> 00:00:58.570 
of the time ease exactly what you need
and<00:00:57.229> will<00:00:57.350> make<00:00:57.530> any<00:00:57.739> session<00:00:58.129> go<00:00:58.309> judge<00:00:58.489> that

00:00:58.570 --> 00:00:58.580 
and will make any session go judge that

00:00:58.580 --> 00:01:00.729 
and will make any session go judge that
low<00:00:58.670> it's<00:00:58.820> smoother<00:00:59.269> so<00:00:59.900> on<00:01:00.140> the<00:01:00.229> vocal<00:01:00.589> I'm

00:01:00.729 --> 00:01:00.739 
low it's smoother so on the vocal I'm

00:01:00.739 --> 00:01:04.359 
low it's smoother so on the vocal I'm

rather beautiful I'm not sure where I
got<00:01:21.650> the<00:01:21.800> idea<00:01:22.160> I<00:01:22.370> think<00:01:22.460> I<00:01:22.670> probably<00:01:22.820> nicked

00:01:23.110 --> 00:01:23.120 
got the idea I think I probably nicked

00:01:23.120 --> 00:01:24.430 
got the idea I think I probably nicked
it<00:01:23.210> from<00:01:23.240> someone<00:01:23.630> however<00:01:24.080> using<00:01:24.380> a

00:01:24.430 --> 00:01:24.440 
it from someone however using a

00:01:24.440 --> 00:01:26.740 
it from someone however using a
Fairchild<00:01:24.860> on<00:01:24.950> vocals<00:01:25.370> which<00:01:25.550> is<00:01:25.700> not<00:01:26.180> really

00:01:26.740 --> 00:01:26.750 
Fairchild on vocals which is not really

00:01:26.750 --> 00:01:28.840 
Fairchild on vocals which is not really
what<00:01:26.960> most<00:01:27.320> people<00:01:27.530> think<00:01:27.620> of<00:01:27.740> it<00:01:27.830> useful<00:01:28.220> but

00:01:28.840 --> 00:01:28.850 
what most people think of it useful but

00:01:28.850 --> 00:01:30.490 
what most people think of it useful but
it<00:01:29.210> works<00:01:29.450> really<00:01:29.720> well<00:01:29.840> it's<00:01:30.110> really<00:01:30.350> gentle

00:01:30.490 --> 00:01:30.500 
it works really well it's really gentle

00:01:30.500 --> 00:01:31.990 
it works really well it's really gentle
it<00:01:30.680> can<00:01:30.890> be<00:01:31.040> really<00:01:31.280> gentle<00:01:31.490> obviously<00:01:31.880> if<00:01:31.940> you

00:01:31.990 --> 00:01:32.000 
it can be really gentle obviously if you

00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:33.430 
it can be really gentle obviously if you
want<00:01:32.150> to<00:01:32.210> thrash<00:01:32.420> it<00:01:32.659> you<00:01:32.750> can<00:01:32.990> do<00:01:33.170> but<00:01:33.320> it<00:01:33.409> can

00:01:33.430 --> 00:01:33.440 
want to thrash it you can do but it can

00:01:33.440 --> 00:01:35.740 
want to thrash it you can do but it can
be<00:01:33.680> really<00:01:33.860> gentle<00:01:34.040> as<00:01:34.190> well<00:01:34.420> and<00:01:35.420> a<00:01:35.570> bit<00:01:35.690> of

00:01:35.740 --> 00:01:35.750 
be really gentle as well and a bit of

00:01:35.750 --> 00:01:38.320 
be really gentle as well and a bit of
mod<00:01:35.900> delay<00:01:36.200> again<00:01:36.770> I'm<00:01:37.610> using<00:01:37.729> this<00:01:37.880> to<00:01:38.060> spread

00:01:38.320 --> 00:01:38.330 
mod delay again I'm using this to spread

00:01:38.330 --> 00:01:40.000 
mod delay again I'm using this to spread
to<00:01:38.570> create<00:01:38.810> a<00:01:38.840> bit<00:01:38.960> of<00:01:39.020> a<00:01:39.050> stereo<00:01:39.380> space<00:01:39.680> for

00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:40.010 
to create a bit of a stereo space for

00:01:40.010 --> 00:01:42.630 
to create a bit of a stereo space for
the<00:01:40.070> vocal<00:01:40.460> 22<00:01:41.210> 28<00:01:41.570> milliseconds<00:01:42.110> either<00:01:42.229> side

00:01:42.630 --> 00:01:42.640 
the vocal 22 28 milliseconds either side

00:01:42.640 --> 00:01:46.210 
the vocal 22 28 milliseconds either side
and<00:01:43.640> I'm<00:01:43.850> using<00:01:44.000> the<00:01:44.180> air<00:01:44.330> EQ<00:01:44.750> so<00:01:45.530> let<00:01:45.920> me<00:01:46.040> just

00:01:46.210 --> 00:01:46.220 
and I'm using the air EQ so let me just

00:01:46.220 --> 00:01:48.399

really like about the airy cube which
let's<00:02:48.800> face<00:02:48.860> it<00:02:49.010> most<00:02:49.370> people<00:02:49.730> think<00:02:49.910> of<00:02:50.150> as<00:02:50.330> a

00:02:50.350 --> 00:02:50.360 
let's face it most people think of as a

00:02:50.360 --> 00:02:53.340 
let's face it most people think of as a
kind<00:02:50.630> of<00:02:50.690> a<00:02:50.780> bus<00:02:51.050> or<00:02:51.320> a<00:02:51.380> master<00:02:52.130> channel<00:02:52.460> EQ<00:02:52.940> I

00:02:53.340 --> 00:02:53.350 
kind of a bus or a master channel EQ I

00:02:53.350 --> 00:02:55.510 
kind of a bus or a master channel EQ I
really<00:02:54.350> like<00:02:54.470> the<00:02:54.560> fact<00:02:54.740> that<00:02:54.770> I<00:02:54.890> can<00:02:55.010> use<00:02:55.280> the

00:02:55.510 --> 00:02:55.520 
really like the fact that I can use the

00:02:55.520 --> 00:02:58.060 
really like the fact that I can use the
water<00:02:55.970> and<00:02:56.330> fire<00:02:56.600> the<00:02:56.960> character<00:02:57.380> setting<00:02:57.710> to

00:02:58.060 --> 00:02:58.070 
water and fire the character setting to

00:02:58.070 --> 00:03:00.130 
water and fire the character setting to
get<00:02:58.220> in<00:02:58.370> and<00:02:58.490> make<00:02:58.640> my<00:02:58.670> EQ<00:02:59.480> bit<00:02:59.660> more<00:02:59.780> pointing

00:03:00.130 --> 00:03:00.140 
get in and make my EQ bit more pointing

00:03:00.140 --> 00:03:02.980 
get in and make my EQ bit more pointing
it<00:03:00.230> must<00:03:00.380> elated<00:03:00.860> or<00:03:01.040> smooth<00:03:01.940> it<00:03:02.150> out<00:03:02.270> going

00:03:02.980 --> 00:03:02.990 
it must elated or smooth it out going

00:03:02.990 --> 00:03:04.330 
it must elated or smooth it out going
back<00:03:03.110> to<00:03:03.170> the<00:03:03.260> water<00:03:03.440> tones<00:03:03.710> I<00:03:03.890> kind<00:03:04.130> of<00:03:04.190> like

00:03:04.330 --> 00:03:04.340 
back to the water tones I kind of like

00:03:04.340 --> 00:03:06.880 
back to the water tones I kind of like
it<00:03:04.370> more<00:03:04.670> pointed<00:03:05.030> a<00:03:05.090> bit<00:03:05.210> more<00:03:05.360> kind<00:03:05.570> of<00:03:05.890> more

00:03:06.880 --> 00:03:06.890 
it more pointed a bit more kind of more

00:03:06.890 --> 00:03:08.920 
it more pointed a bit more kind of more

that's<00:03:11.060> probably<00:03:11.630> the<00:03:11.780> main<00:03:11.960> bit<00:03:12.230> that<00:03:12.440> I'm

00:03:12.520 --> 00:03:12.530 
that's probably the main bit that I'm

00:03:12.530 --> 00:03:13.750 
that's probably the main bit that I'm
actually<00:03:12.650> running<00:03:12.920> in<00:03:13.190> here<00:03:13.340> for<00:03:13.490> her<00:03:13.580> vocal

here<00:03:37.130> no<00:03:37.550> EQ<00:03:37.970> no<00:03:38.300> reverb<00:03:38.540> I'm<00:03:38.870> just<00:03:39.140> using<00:03:39.380> the

00:03:39.550 --> 00:03:39.560 
here no EQ no reverb I'm just using the

00:03:39.560 --> 00:03:41.920 
here no EQ no reverb I'm just using the
channels<00:03:39.890> to<00:03:39.950> balance<00:03:40.370> if<00:03:41.030> I<00:03:41.150> solo<00:03:41.450> those<00:03:41.690> up

00:03:41.920 --> 00:03:41.930 
channels to balance if I solo those up

00:03:41.930 --> 00:03:44.200 
channels to balance if I solo those up
you<00:03:42.170> can<00:03:42.740> see<00:03:42.980> I'm<00:03:43.160> running<00:03:43.310> through<00:03:43.670> just<00:03:43.700> two

00:03:44.200 --> 00:03:44.210 
you can see I'm running through just two

00:03:44.210 --> 00:03:46.120 
you can see I'm running through just two
plugins<00:03:44.510> are<00:03:44.870> EQ<00:03:45.380> which<00:03:45.650> we'll<00:03:45.770> come<00:03:45.890> to<00:03:45.920> in<00:03:46.010> a

00:03:46.120 --> 00:03:46.130 
plugins are EQ which we'll come to in a

00:03:46.130 --> 00:03:49.510 
plugins are EQ which we'll come to in a
second<00:03:46.400> and<00:03:46.550> the<00:03:47.330> SSL<00:03:47.780> channel<00:03:48.290> strip<00:03:48.560> it's

00:03:49.510 --> 00:03:49.520 
second and the SSL channel strip it's

00:03:49.520 --> 00:03:50.650 
second and the SSL channel strip it's
called<00:03:49.760> the<00:03:49.850> glue<00:03:50.060> for<00:03:50.270> a<00:03:50.330> reason<00:03:50.630> just

00:03:50.650 --> 00:03:50.660 
called the glue for a reason just

00:03:50.660 --> 00:03:52.000 
called the glue for a reason just
binding<00:03:51.140> it<00:03:51.230> all<00:03:51.290> together<00:03:51.440> making<00:03:51.770> a<00:03:51.920> bit

00:03:52.000 --> 00:03:52.010 
binding it all together making a bit

00:03:52.010 --> 00:03:55.300 
binding it all together making a bit
more<00:03:52.190> cohesive<00:03:53.380> so<00:03:54.380> listen<00:03:54.650> to<00:03:54.709> that<00:03:54.770> EQ<00:03:55.280> on

00:03:55.300 --> 00:03:55.310 
more cohesive so listen to that EQ on

00:03:55.310 --> 00:03:57.670 
more cohesive so listen to that EQ on
the<00:03:55.580> guitar<00:03:55.880> and<00:03:55.910> again<00:03:56.209> I'm<00:03:57.170> using<00:03:57.440> this

00:03:57.670 --> 00:03:57.680 
the guitar and again I'm using this

00:03:57.680 --> 00:03:59.050 
the guitar and again I'm using this
really<00:03:57.860> to<00:03:58.040> pull<00:03:58.190> up<00:03:58.280> that<00:03:58.370> top-end<00:03:58.610> that<00:03:58.910> kind

00:03:59.050 --> 00:03:59.060 
really to pull up that top-end that kind

00:04:45.880 --> 00:04:45.890 
it's really important to get the tails

00:04:45.890 --> 00:04:48.010

again I'm using the air EQ just to

00:04:58.130 --> 00:05:00.190 
again I'm using the air EQ just to
sweeten<00:04:58.460> up<00:04:58.670> the<00:04:58.730> top-end<00:04:59.030> give<00:04:59.960> me<00:05:00.050> a<00:05:00.080> little

sweeten up the top-end give me a little

00:05:00.200 --> 00:05:02.350 
sweeten up the top-end give me a little
bit<00:05:00.320> more<00:05:00.440> punch<00:05:01.070> around<00:05:01.340> fifty<00:05:02.180> to<00:05:02.270> a<00:05:02.300> hundred

00:05:04.240 --> 00:05:04.250 
Hertz on the bottom end and I'm using

00:05:04.250 --> 00:05:06.460 
Hertz on the bottom end and I'm using
the<00:05:04.370> avid<00:05:04.640> Pro<00:05:05.150> limiter<00:05:05.660> just<00:05:05.900> to<00:05:05.990> hold<00:05:06.200> it<00:05:06.320> all

00:05:06.460 --> 00:05:06.470 
the avid Pro limiter just to hold it all

00:05:06.470 --> 00:05:08.230 
the avid Pro limiter just to hold it all
together<00:05:06.620> stop<00:05:07.460> me<00:05:07.580> peaking<00:05:07.940> or<00:05:08.030> doing

anything silly the one thing I love

00:05:09.770 --> 00:05:11.560 
anything silly the one thing I love
about<00:05:09.800> this<00:05:10.070> limiter<00:05:10.460> is<00:05:10.669> it<00:05:10.940> doesn't<00:05:11.210> color

00:05:11.560 --> 00:05:11.570 
about this limiter is it doesn't color

00:05:11.570 --> 00:05:13.840 
about this limiter is it doesn't color
you<00:05:12.020> just<00:05:12.290> get<00:05:12.500> the<00:05:12.620> control<00:05:13.070> you<00:05:13.280> don't<00:05:13.550> get

00:05:13.840 --> 00:05:13.850 
you just get the control you don't get

00:05:13.850 --> 00:05:16.720 
you just get the control you don't get
the<00:05:14.060> color<00:05:14.270> of<00:05:14.510> other<00:05:15.160> other<00:05:16.160> brands<00:05:16.580> of

the color of other other brands of

00:05:16.730 --> 00:05:21.010 
the color of other other brands of
limiter<00:05:17.090> so<00:05:18.460> altogether<00:05:19.460> it<00:05:20.090> just<00:05:20.510> works

00:05:21.010 --> 00:05:21.020 
limiter so altogether it just works

00:05:21.020 --> 00:05:23.010 
limiter so altogether it just works
this<00:05:21.290> whole<00:05:21.470> keeping<00:05:21.830> it<00:05:21.950> simple<00:05:22.130> sticking<00:05:22.730> to

00:05:23.010 --> 00:05:23.020 
this whole keeping it simple sticking to

00:05:23.020 --> 00:05:25.150 
this whole keeping it simple sticking to
minimal<00:05:24.020> numbers<00:05:24.350> of<00:05:24.470> plugins<00:05:24.740> is<00:05:24.860> really

00:05:25.150 --> 00:05:25.160 
minimal numbers of plugins is really

00:05:25.160 --> 00:05:27.130 
minimal numbers of plugins is really
working<00:05:25.490> for<00:05:25.520> me<00:05:25.640> at<00:05:25.790> the<00:05:25.880> moment<00:05:26.030> maybe<00:05:26.990> you

00:05:27.130 --> 00:05:27.140 
working for me at the moment maybe you

00:05:27.140 --> 00:05:29.470 
working for me at the moment maybe you
should<00:05:27.290> give<00:05:27.410> it<00:05:27.440> a<00:05:27.560> go<00:05:27.710> the<00:05:28.340> air<00:05:28.490> EQ<00:05:28.940> again

00:05:29.470 --> 00:05:29.480 
should give it a go the air EQ again

00:05:29.480 --> 00:05:32.530 
should give it a go the air EQ again
most<00:05:29.900> people<00:05:30.080> think<00:05:30.169> of<00:05:30.290> it<00:05:30.410> as<00:05:30.620> a<00:05:31.010> buss<00:05:31.510> EQ<00:05:32.510> or

00:05:32.530 --> 00:05:32.540 
most people think of it as a buss EQ or

00:05:32.540 --> 00:05:35.170 
most people think of it as a buss EQ or
a<00:05:32.780> mastering<00:05:33.410> EQ<00:05:33.530> but<00:05:34.430> certainly<00:05:34.850> it<00:05:35.000> works

00:05:35.170 --> 00:05:35.180 
a mastering EQ but certainly it works

00:05:35.180 --> 00:05:36.640 
a mastering EQ but certainly it works
really<00:05:35.510> really<00:05:35.660> well<00:05:35.900> when<00:05:36.290> you<00:05:36.380> come<00:05:36.530> to

00:05:36.640 --> 00:05:36.650 
really really well when you come to

00:05:36.650 --> 00:05:37.870 
really really well when you come to
looking<00:05:36.890> at<00:05:36.980> individual<00:05:37.370> channels<00:05:37.669> because

00:05:37.870 --> 00:05:37.880 
looking at individual channels because

00:05:37.880 --> 00:05:39.670 
looking at individual channels because
the<00:05:38.030> sculpting<00:05:38.570> and<00:05:38.690> the<00:05:39.050> nature<00:05:39.380> of<00:05:39.410> being<00:05:39.590> a
