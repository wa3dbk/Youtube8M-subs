00:00:00.230 --> 00:00:03.679
 or the one that is the people of youtube my 

00:00:02.120 --> 00:00:07.490
 name is vÃ­ctor and now I'm going to 

00:00:03.679 --> 00:00:13.129
 draw the isolated plant of 20 are 

00:00:07.490 --> 00:00:15.949
 2002 is the iceberg lettuce and well this 

00:00:13.129 --> 00:00:18.109
 I apologize for the quality of 

00:00:15.949 --> 00:00:21.050
 sound is that I do not have a good 

00:00:18.109 --> 00:00:22.820
 microphone work and that's why I took like 

00:00:21.050 --> 00:00:25.699
 two months to be able to do another tutorial 

00:00:22.820 --> 00:00:28.550
 like this one and then he had to make me 

00:00:25.699 --> 00:00:31.339
 with this quality and I hope not not 

00:00:28.550 --> 00:00:34.520
 bother and well here you are seeing how 

00:00:31.339 --> 00:00:36.590
 I'm making the lettuce this 

00:00:34.520 --> 00:00:39.020
 you will see there was no weight with a circle and the 

00:00:36.590 --> 00:00:40.430
 I started with the lines if I did not 

00:00:39.020 --> 00:00:42.920
 they understood the previous costs this one 

00:00:40.430 --> 00:00:45.609
 you can pass the video can return 

00:00:42.920 --> 00:00:47.990
 they can pass the video no problem 

00:00:45.609 --> 00:00:50.300
 this 

00:00:47.990 --> 00:00:52.670
 here they are looking as if all the 

00:00:50.300 --> 00:00:54.910
 guides as he says there to do the 

00:00:52.670 --> 00:00:54.910
 eyes 

00:00:55.980 --> 00:01:00.440
 on the one hand it takes a very 

00:00:58.710 --> 00:01:02.670
 simple to do this character but 

00:01:00.440 --> 00:01:06.500
 this fish in the hill other characters of 

00:01:02.670 --> 00:01:06.500
 brandes against zombies two like 

00:01:06.580 --> 00:01:12.270
 the cannon of coconuts or other characters that 

00:01:10.690 --> 00:01:15.450
 they come there 

00:01:12.270 --> 00:01:19.530
 and so on so that I have a little bit of 

00:01:15.450 --> 00:01:21.479
 little time since I make the lettuce 

00:01:19.530 --> 00:01:22.960
 and well here we are going to remark with a lot 

00:01:21.479 --> 00:01:25.900
 watch out 

00:01:22.960 --> 00:01:27.369
 and the materials you used may be 

00:01:25.900 --> 00:01:29.740
 down in the description is the leave 

00:01:27.369 --> 00:01:34.649
 so they can get them out 

00:01:29.740 --> 00:01:34.649
 and well here they are all and towing 

00:01:35.090 --> 00:01:42.079
 and then a month two months ago that I do not 

00:01:40.189 --> 00:01:45.020
 a tutorial on this of plants against 

00:01:42.079 --> 00:01:48.020
 zombies and there it is I'm going to start 

00:01:45.020 --> 00:01:50.050
 color it here I started with the color 

00:01:48.020 --> 00:01:52.720
 black 

00:01:50.050 --> 00:01:55.920
 and let's start with the lighter colors 

00:01:52.720 --> 00:01:55.920
 even the strongest 

00:01:56.700 --> 00:02:03.340
 here they use a range of blues and 

00:02:00.190 --> 00:02:06.180
 green green because green is because 

00:02:03.340 --> 00:02:08.580
 as it stands out in it 

00:02:06.180 --> 00:02:12.150
 in the lettuce of what I've seen in the 

00:02:08.580 --> 00:02:15.600
 original image that comes green from 

00:02:12.150 --> 00:02:17.940
 the center out here in this 

00:02:15.600 --> 00:02:21.720
 part I was wrong a bit for this 

00:02:17.940 --> 00:02:24.520
 name said that it came a cooking like 

00:02:21.720 --> 00:02:27.070
 if it were bright from inside 

00:02:24.520 --> 00:02:29.950
 and I started to erase him a little later 

00:02:27.070 --> 00:02:33.780
 is nothing of that part I'm here I'm 

00:02:29.950 --> 00:02:33.780
 starting to blur with the white 

00:02:33.810 --> 00:02:39.110
 and I started to start doing 

00:02:35.610 --> 00:02:39.110
 combinations of blue and green colors 

00:02:41.180 --> 00:02:48.060
 later white 

00:02:46.230 --> 00:02:50.250
 and what started there to erase to be able 

00:02:48.060 --> 00:02:53.580
 clarify the center you can 

00:02:50.250 --> 00:02:55.060
 avoid that and televising so that not a 

00:02:53.580 --> 00:02:59.550
 error 

00:02:55.060 --> 00:03:01.800
 and I started doing that kind of effect 

00:02:59.550 --> 00:03:05.030
 and good in this was very short to the 

00:03:01.800 --> 00:03:07.459

00:03:05.030 --> 00:03:11.000
