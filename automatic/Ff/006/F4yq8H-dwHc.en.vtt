bit by the looks which is why too
strongly<00:01:00.859> also<00:01:01.859> you'll<00:01:02.039> see<00:01:02.250> that<00:01:02.430> the<00:01:02.609> armor

00:01:02.930 --> 00:01:02.940 
strongly also you'll see that the armor

00:01:02.940 --> 00:01:04.850 
strongly also you'll see that the armor
of<00:01:02.969> the<00:01:03.059> other<00:01:03.329> people<00:01:03.719> are<00:01:03.840> so<00:01:04.470> good<00:01:04.739> you

00:01:06.170 --> 00:01:06.180 
can't scratch them with your bullets

00:01:06.180 --> 00:01:09.800 
can't scratch them with your bullets
which<00:01:06.810> makes<00:01:07.049> it<00:01:07.260> a<00:01:07.320> bit<00:01:07.549> just<00:01:08.810> disheartened

00:01:09.800 --> 00:01:09.810 
which makes it a bit just disheartened

00:01:09.810 --> 00:01:14.120 
which makes it a bit just disheartened
well<00:01:10.049> while<00:01:10.350> playing<00:01:10.700> as<00:01:11.700> you'll<00:01:11.939> say<00:01:13.130> graphic

some good for away I think the graphics

00:01:16.320 --> 00:01:18.859 
some good for away I think the graphics
are<00:01:16.439> cracking<00:01:16.860> I<00:01:17.340> can't<00:01:18.000> really<00:01:18.299> fault<00:01:18.540> the

00:01:18.859 --> 00:01:18.869 
are cracking I can't really fault the

00:01:18.869 --> 00:01:20.539 
are cracking I can't really fault the
graphics<00:01:19.229> or<00:01:19.530> anything<00:01:19.799> like<00:01:19.830> a<00:01:20.009> single

00:01:20.539 --> 00:01:20.549 
graphics or anything like a single

00:01:20.549 --> 00:01:23.090 
graphics or anything like a single
player<00:01:20.729> really<00:01:21.180> good<00:01:21.330> as<00:01:21.479> well<00:01:21.689> for<00:01:22.320> away<00:01:22.650> your

00:01:23.090 --> 00:01:23.100 
player really good as well for away your

00:01:23.100 --> 00:01:25.940 
player really good as well for away your
humor<00:01:23.460> xbox<00:01:24.090> or<00:01:24.270> ps3<00:01:24.560> fanboy<00:01:25.560> then<00:01:25.799> you'll

00:01:25.940 --> 00:01:25.950 
humor xbox or ps3 fanboy then you'll

00:01:25.950 --> 00:01:27.490 
humor xbox or ps3 fanboy then you'll
think<00:01:26.130> the<00:01:26.250> graphics<00:01:26.610> are<00:01:26.759> terrible<00:01:27.150> but

00:01:27.490 --> 00:01:27.500 
think the graphics are terrible but

00:01:27.500 --> 00:01:30.289 
think the graphics are terrible but
everyone<00:01:28.500> to<00:01:28.619> themselves<00:01:29.040> I<00:01:29.220> guess<00:01:29.400> and<00:01:29.670> I'm

00:01:30.289 --> 00:01:30.299 
everyone to themselves I guess and I'm

00:01:30.299 --> 00:01:32.960 
everyone to themselves I guess and I'm
playing<00:01:30.570> this<00:01:30.689> with<00:01:30.900> a<00:01:31.130> classic<00:01:32.130> control<00:01:32.700> pad

00:01:32.960 --> 00:01:32.970 
playing this with a classic control pad

00:01:32.970 --> 00:01:36.140 
playing this with a classic control pad
and<00:01:33.619> it's<00:01:34.619> quite<00:01:35.070> awkward<00:01:35.310> getting<00:01:35.880> used<00:01:36.030> to

00:01:36.140 --> 00:01:36.150 
and it's quite awkward getting used to

00:01:36.150 --> 00:01:37.850 
and it's quite awkward getting used to
the<00:01:36.270> controls<00:01:36.689> because<00:01:36.930> obviously<00:01:37.290> they

00:01:37.850 --> 00:01:37.860 
the controls because obviously they

00:01:37.860 --> 00:01:39.230 
the controls because obviously they
haven't<00:01:37.979> got<00:01:38.189> a<00:01:38.220> lot<00:01:38.280> of<00:01:38.340> two<00:01:38.610> triggers<00:01:39.000> at<00:01:39.150> the

00:01:39.230 --> 00:01:39.240 
haven't got a lot of two triggers at the

00:01:39.240 --> 00:01:41.390 
haven't got a lot of two triggers at the
bottom<00:01:39.570> but<00:01:40.560> if<00:01:40.650> you've<00:01:40.740> got<00:01:40.860> a<00:01:40.890> classic

00:01:41.390 --> 00:01:41.400 
bottom but if you've got a classic

00:01:41.400 --> 00:01:43.130 
bottom but if you've got a classic
control<00:01:41.729> packet<00:01:42.090> row<00:01:42.210> then<00:01:42.540> you'll<00:01:42.689> find<00:01:42.930> it<00:01:43.079> a

00:01:43.130 --> 00:01:43.140 
control packet row then you'll find it a

00:01:43.140 --> 00:01:46.370 
control packet row then you'll find it a
lot<00:01:43.229> easier<00:01:43.520> can't<00:01:44.520> use<00:01:44.790> I<00:01:45.119> can't<00:01:45.659> use<00:01:45.930> the

00:01:46.370 --> 00:01:46.380 
lot easier can't use I can't use the
