00:05:17.390 --> 00:05:17.400 
stuff and make a very compelling tool

00:05:17.400 --> 00:05:21.920 
stuff and make a very compelling tool
for<00:05:17.789> change<00:05:20.000> so<00:05:21.000> let's<00:05:21.300> go<00:05:21.479> a<00:05:21.510> little<00:05:21.659> further

00:05:21.920 --> 00:05:21.930 
for change so let's go a little further

00:05:21.930 --> 00:05:24.529 
for change so let's go a little further
with<00:05:22.080> this<00:05:22.349> idea<00:05:22.680> of<00:05:22.800> Health<00:05:23.070> and<00:05:23.510> how<00:05:24.510> a

with this idea of Health and how a

00:05:24.539 --> 00:05:29.120 
with this idea of Health and how a
mind-body<00:05:25.320> practice<00:05:25.949> can<00:05:26.490> affect<00:05:27.180> it<00:05:27.500> if<00:05:28.500> you

00:05:29.120 --> 00:05:29.130 
mind-body practice can affect it if you

00:05:29.130 --> 00:05:33.409 
mind-body practice can affect it if you
run<00:05:29.460> or<00:05:29.849> swim<00:05:30.330> or<00:05:30.840> do<00:05:31.729> some<00:05:32.729> other<00:05:32.849> aerobic

00:05:33.409 --> 00:05:33.419

run or swim or do some other aerobic
exercise<00:05:33.930> which<00:05:34.139> gives<00:05:34.380> you<00:05:34.500> endorphins<00:05:34.889> the

00:05:35.589 --> 00:05:35.599 
exercise which gives you endorphins the

00:05:35.599 --> 00:05:40.189 
exercise which gives you endorphins the
body<00:05:36.599> releases<00:05:37.560> these<00:05:38.690> internal<00:05:39.690> chemicals

00:05:40.189 --> 00:05:40.199 
body releases these internal chemicals

00:05:40.199 --> 00:05:43.219 
body releases these internal chemicals
and<00:05:40.380> they<00:05:40.800> make<00:05:40.979> you<00:05:41.099> feel<00:05:41.340> good<00:05:41.580> and<00:05:42.080> then<00:05:43.080> at

00:05:43.219 --> 00:05:43.229 
and they make you feel good and then at

00:05:43.229 --> 00:05:45.969 
and they make you feel good and then at
the<00:05:43.349> end<00:05:43.530> of<00:05:43.889> their<00:05:44.610> run<00:05:45.000> in<00:05:45.030> your<00:05:45.510> bloodstream

00:05:45.969 --> 00:05:45.979 
the end of their run in your bloodstream

00:05:45.979 --> 00:05:50.089 
the end of their run in your bloodstream
they<00:05:46.979> diminish<00:05:47.820> and<00:05:48.300> they<00:05:48.870> are<00:05:49.099> metabolized

00:05:50.089 --> 00:05:50.099 
they diminish and they are metabolized

00:05:50.099 --> 00:05:53.570 
they diminish and they are metabolized
and<00:05:50.460> what's<00:05:50.880> left<00:05:51.210> is<00:05:51.770> either<00:05:52.770> a<00:05:53.010> feeling<00:05:53.490> of

00:05:53.570 --> 00:05:53.580 
and what's left is either a feeling of

fatigue or a feeling of emptiness or at

00:05:58.260 --> 00:06:00.260 
fatigue or a feeling of emptiness or at
best<00:05:58.620> case<00:05:58.860> you're<00:05:59.370> back<00:05:59.580> to<00:05:59.820> where<00:05:59.970> you<00:06:00.120> were

00:06:00.260 --> 00:06:00.270 
best case you're back to where you were

00:06:00.270 --> 00:06:04.110 
best case you're back to where you were
before<00:06:00.900> that<00:06:01.169> rush<00:06:01.620> of<00:06:01.740> endorphins<00:06:02.430> occurred

00:06:04.110 --> 00:06:04.120 
before that rush of endorphins occurred

00:06:04.120 --> 00:06:10.409 
before that rush of endorphins occurred
if<00:06:04.660> you<00:06:04.930> were<00:06:05.050> to<00:06:05.260> couple<00:06:05.940> the<00:06:08.190> new<00:06:09.419> sensations

00:06:10.409 --> 00:06:10.419 
if you were to couple the new sensations

00:06:10.419 --> 00:06:12.030 
if you were to couple the new sensations
and<00:06:10.630> new<00:06:10.750> thoughts<00:06:11.020> and<00:06:11.260> new<00:06:11.410> feelings<00:06:11.860> that

00:06:12.030 --> 00:06:12.040 
and new thoughts and new feelings that

00:06:12.040 --> 00:06:15.480 
and new thoughts and new feelings that
came<00:06:12.280> with<00:06:12.820> a<00:06:12.850> good<00:06:13.120> run<00:06:13.389> with<00:06:14.260> some<00:06:14.590> new<00:06:14.830> ideas

00:06:15.480 --> 00:06:15.490 
came with a good run with some new ideas

00:06:15.490 --> 00:06:18.810 
came with a good run with some new ideas
then<00:06:16.449> you<00:06:17.229> could<00:06:17.440> say<00:06:17.620> that<00:06:17.830> at<00:06:18.010> the<00:06:18.130> end<00:06:18.160> of

00:06:18.810 --> 00:06:18.820 
then you could say that at the end of

00:06:18.820 --> 00:06:22.770 
then you could say that at the end of
the<00:06:19.000> endorphins<00:06:19.449> cycle<00:06:21.000> your<00:06:22.000> brain<00:06:22.479> would

00:06:22.770 --> 00:06:22.780 
the endorphins cycle your brain would

00:06:22.780 --> 00:06:26.030 
the endorphins cycle your brain would
then<00:06:23.050> be<00:06:23.320> tickled<00:06:23.919> by<00:06:24.360> new<00:06:25.360> ways<00:06:25.630> of<00:06:25.870> thinking

00:06:26.030 --> 00:06:26.040 
then be tickled by new ways of thinking

00:06:26.040 --> 00:06:31.050 
then be tickled by new ways of thinking
about<00:06:27.040> stuff<00:06:27.400> and<00:06:28.260> so<00:06:29.260> you<00:06:29.710> could<00:06:29.919> prolong<00:06:30.250> the

00:06:31.050 --> 00:06:31.060 
about stuff and so you could prolong the

00:06:31.060 --> 00:06:34.050 
about stuff and so you could prolong the
experience<00:06:31.810> that<00:06:32.770> the<00:06:32.979> endorphins<00:06:33.430> initially

00:06:34.050 --> 00:06:34.060 
experience that the endorphins initially

00:06:34.060 --> 00:06:37.080 
experience that the endorphins initially
gave<00:06:34.270> you<00:06:34.540> this<00:06:34.990> is<00:06:35.139> just<00:06:35.320> one<00:06:35.560> simple<00:06:36.090> notion

00:06:37.080 --> 00:06:37.090 
gave you this is just one simple notion

00:06:37.090 --> 00:06:40.350 
gave you this is just one simple notion
we<00:06:37.990> have<00:06:38.229> health<00:06:38.919> and<00:06:39.250> we<00:06:39.580> have<00:06:39.700> we're<00:06:40.030> talking

we have health and we have we're talking

00:06:40.360 --> 00:06:42.360 
we have health and we have we're talking
