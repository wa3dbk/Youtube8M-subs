00:00:08.559 --> 00:00:14.809
 I would not have been accompanied will be 

00:00:11.980 --> 00:00:17.270
 bottom almost unimaginable for 

00:00:14.809 --> 00:00:19.670
 take back bread I would have never worked 

00:00:17.270 --> 00:00:21.650
 as much and then the margin was huge 

00:00:19.670 --> 00:00:23.660
 I was really starting from scratch what I 

00:00:21.650 --> 00:00:25.250
 did not realize in fact and no bah 

00:00:23.660 --> 00:00:27.589
 for sure, it's a lot more 

00:00:25.250 --> 00:00:28.039
 that to come back uncrossed must be 

00:00:27.589 --> 00:00:30.140
 accompanied 

00:00:28.039 --> 00:00:32.630
 we can not be left out on 

00:00:30.140 --> 00:00:34.910
 the side despite being con con is that 

00:00:32.630 --> 00:00:35.390
 in training center feel more 

00:00:34.910 --> 00:00:38.630
 strong 

00:00:35.390 --> 00:00:43.180
 yes, but most of all, I matured a lot 

00:00:38.630 --> 00:00:46.010
 been very beneficial late there's no picture that 

00:00:43.180 --> 00:00:48.260
 that it's important for a recovery that 

00:00:46.010 --> 00:00:49.700
 to have a physical trainer or do you 

00:00:48.260 --> 00:00:52.520
 would it be a person who is 

00:00:49.700 --> 00:00:54.260
 know indeed have the sign 

00:00:52.520 --> 00:00:57.650
 fitness trainer who knowledgeable 

00:00:54.260 --> 00:00:59.360
 in that and that they can help a knee 

00:00:57.650 --> 00:01:02.750
 a young person to take back at last must have 

00:00:59.360 --> 00:01:04.729
 someone who follow you from the beginning 

00:01:02.750 --> 00:01:06.650
 end since this phase of the world not 

00:01:04.729 --> 00:01:08.150
 since the beginning of the crusaders but since 

00:01:06.650 --> 00:01:10.070
 the rat phase and isation because 

00:01:08.150 --> 00:01:11.660
 the coaches have no time it's a 

00:01:10.070 --> 00:01:15.080
 phase that in my opinion must be taken into 

00:01:11.660 --> 00:01:17.570
 charge by a specialist who is not 

00:01:15.080 --> 00:01:19.790
 purely technical fields such as 

00:01:17.570 --> 00:01:22.130
 coaches in their own right and who is not 

00:01:19.790 --> 00:01:24.560
 purely medical field such as 

00:01:22.130 --> 00:01:26.600
 doctors and physiotherapists and the 

00:01:24.560 --> 00:01:27.770
 osteopaths also can do so 

00:01:26.600 --> 00:01:29.630
 for me it is someone who must 

00:01:27.770 --> 00:01:31.520
 take care of that because 

00:01:29.630 --> 00:01:33.200
 that he must be riding between them between 

00:01:31.520 --> 00:01:35.120
 between all these disciplines there and 

00:01:33.200 --> 00:01:37.340
 course in listening to 100% as 

00:01:35.120 --> 00:01:39.050
 well of the athlete that only coaches 

00:01:37.340 --> 00:01:41.540
 who will then be able to use 

00:01:39.050 --> 00:01:43.280
 the athlete who will have found fully 

00:01:41.540 --> 00:01:45.080
 its means we are not a department 

00:01:43.280 --> 00:01:48.799
 to return to a certain level that requires 

00:01:45.080 --> 00:01:50.930
 more than two abilities to come more 

00:01:48.799 --> 00:01:52.040
 fast franco be accompanied we will not have 

00:01:50.930 --> 00:01:53.630
 three months to get back in the bath 

00:01:52.040 --> 00:01:56.060
 what do I know when I will resume 

00:01:53.630 --> 00:01:58.070
 I will not have is 100% but I 

00:01:56.060 --> 00:01:59.130
 I can not go before 

00:01:58.070 --> 00:02:01.409
 that I am at least 

00:01:59.130 --> 00:02:03.719
 70% of my abilities because otherwise 

00:02:01.409 --> 00:02:05.280
 finally the ebay group will always be the 

00:02:03.719 --> 00:02:08.009
 doubt 5 still settles especially in 

00:02:05.280 --> 00:02:10.619
 this moment of the fact that I resume in 

00:02:08.009 --> 00:02:12.330
 a week and that beats I do not know if I 

00:02:10.619 --> 00:02:16.019
 will be at the height of what we 

00:02:12.330 --> 00:02:17.790
 expects from them - from me word at least this 

00:02:16.019 --> 00:02:19.739
 that I know I 'll never be my 

00:02:17.790 --> 00:02:21.209
 real level at least not everything when one 

00:02:19.739 --> 00:02:23.220
 returns from a uncrossed injury that is 

00:02:21.209 --> 00:02:24.840
 still far from innocuous in all 

00:02:23.220 --> 00:02:27.180
 cases after we are practically 

00:02:24.840 --> 00:02:28.860
 his whole career as a basketball player 

00:02:27.180 --> 00:02:30.989
 yes there will be whatever happens a 

00:02:28.860 --> 00:02:33.360
 continuity on the exercises we have 

00:02:30.989 --> 00:02:35.340
 facts they are necessarily different that 

00:02:33.360 --> 00:02:37.980
 will be shorter, of course, but they will be 

00:02:35.340 --> 00:02:39.299
 more intense but shorter but of 

00:02:37.980 --> 00:02:45.030
 every case where it will be whatever happens 

00:02:39.299 --> 00:02:47.280
 followed it's still approval and 

00:02:45.030 --> 00:02:49.019
 saw himself very quickly on the 

00:02:47.280 --> 00:02:50.099
 proprioceptive exercises one saw everything 

00:02:49.019 --> 00:02:52.380
 immediately at the start that there was a 

00:02:50.099 --> 00:02:54.480
 lack of balance on the supports also 

00:02:52.380 --> 00:02:55.739
 well ankle than knee but she was 

00:02:54.480 --> 00:02:57.810
 in a period when she is a small 

00:02:55.739 --> 00:02:59.310
 little blunt physically and since that goes 

00:02:57.810 --> 00:03:00.720
 already much better and will make you 

00:02:59.310 --> 00:03:03.480
 measuring exercises this very quickly 

00:03:00.720 --> 00:03:05.670
 there was progress so here it 

00:03:03.480 --> 00:03:06.930
 means that there is already the best that has 

00:03:05.670 --> 00:03:08.730
 already better on the balance that has 

00:03:06.930 --> 00:03:11.160
 already better about prevention after 

00:03:08.730 --> 00:03:12.959
 on the singing exercises of 

00:03:11.160 --> 00:03:15.090
 changes of support on people on 

00:03:12.959 --> 00:03:15.840
 exercises that demand more than the 

00:03:15.090 --> 00:03:17.910
 strength and endurance 

00:03:15.840 --> 00:03:22.040
 there is still a real progress 

00:03:17.910 --> 00:03:24.299
 especially since a few sessions 

00:03:22.040 --> 00:03:27.510
 I feel pink much better 

00:03:24.299 --> 00:03:29.519
 psychologically and is also 

00:03:27.510 --> 00:03:32.220
 physically and in any case it was a 

00:03:29.519 --> 00:03:33.569
 experience for me that was 

00:03:32.220 --> 00:03:35.280
 really great and it's something 

00:03:33.569 --> 00:03:37.079
 which kept me very much at heart since 

00:03:35.280 --> 00:03:39.450
 the first time i went to nrb 

00:03:37.079 --> 00:03:41.190
 So we talked with Ben causses 

00:03:39.450 --> 00:03:42.840
 we talked to girls and 

00:03:41.190 --> 00:03:45.930
 especially with pink that I discovered this 

00:03:42.840 --> 00:03:48.690
 day and his personality his story 

00:03:45.930 --> 00:03:50.730
 have touched me tremendously and I had him 

00:03:48.690 --> 00:03:52.700
 promised I think that can testify 

00:03:50.730 --> 00:03:54.989
 I had promised that I would do everything to 

00:03:52.700 --> 00:03:57.090
 to return to the training center 

00:03:54.989 --> 00:03:58.920
 would it be like nothing for her because 

00:03:57.090 --> 00:04:00.450
 it had touched me a lot 

00:03:58.920 --> 00:04:02.900
 girl who is enormously sensitive and who 

00:04:00.450 --> 00:04:05.340
 plays a lot on psychology and 

00:04:02.900 --> 00:04:07.079
 alain for that I wanted to fight and I 

00:04:05.340 --> 00:04:08.790
 really wanted to work progress 

00:04:07.079 --> 00:04:10.650
 in re-learning exercises 

00:04:08.790 --> 00:04:12.090
 to make her feel better 

00:04:10.650 --> 00:04:12.780
 as quickly as possible she is 

00:04:12.090 --> 00:04:14.010
 really strong 

00:04:12.780 --> 00:04:16.650
 his head for doing all this because 

00:04:14.010 --> 00:04:19.380
 that come for three months with a 

00:04:16.650 --> 00:04:21.690
 guy case not necessarily been super nice to 

00:04:19.380 --> 00:04:23.550
 moments he had to hang on there 

00:04:21.690 --> 00:04:24.540
 clung to the end while 

00:04:23.550 --> 00:04:27.510
 it's someone who is very fragile 

00:04:24.540 --> 00:04:31.230
 psychologically and casually his 

00:04:27.510 --> 00:04:33.630
 fragility its fragility she still 

00:04:31.230 --> 00:04:37.650
 often succeeds in setting it aside for 

00:04:33.630 --> 00:04:38.850
 to draw strength from it is for and for 

00:04:37.650 --> 00:04:40.889
 become what she became 

00:04:38.850 --> 00:04:42.510
 now ie I think ready 

00:04:40.889 --> 00:04:44.660
 to be able to do basketball like everything 

00:04:42.510 --> 00:04:44.660
 the world 

00:04:48.289 --> 00:04:50.619
 no
