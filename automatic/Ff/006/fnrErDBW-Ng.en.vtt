00:03:40.059 --> 00:03:40.069 
stickiness doesn't bother me it actually

00:03:40.069 --> 00:03:42.430 
stickiness doesn't bother me it actually
lasts<00:03:40.760> a<00:03:40.849> lot<00:03:41.030> longer<00:03:41.090> on<00:03:41.659> my<00:03:41.780> lip<00:03:41.930> one<00:03:42.260> thing<00:03:42.379> i

don't really like all the lip glosses is
the<00:03:44.060> fact<00:03:44.299> that<00:03:44.389> they<00:03:44.540> have<00:03:44.780> glitter<00:03:45.199> in<00:03:45.440> them

00:03:54.109 --> 00:03:55.750 
this one's more of like a satin kind of
look<00:03:54.260> so<00:03:54.500> when<00:03:54.680> i<00:03:54.709> applied<00:03:55.069> in<00:03:55.220> the<00:03:55.280> process<00:03:55.639> to

00:03:55.750 --> 00:03:55.760 
look so when i applied in the process to

00:03:55.760 --> 00:03:57.099 
look so when i applied in the process to
my<00:03:55.849> lips<00:03:56.090> the<00:03:56.389> glitter<00:03:56.629> doesn't<00:03:56.989> really

00:03:57.099 --> 00:03:57.109 
my lips the glitter doesn't really

00:03:57.109 --> 00:03:59.979 
my lips the glitter doesn't really
bother<00:03:57.379> me<00:03:57.590> um<00:03:58.010> what<00:03:58.790> bothers<00:03:59.120> me<00:03:59.180> more<00:03:59.479> so<00:03:59.750> is

00:03:59.979 --> 00:03:59.989 
bother me um what bothers me more so is

00:03:59.989 --> 00:04:01.869 
bother me um what bothers me more so is
the<00:04:00.409> fact<00:04:00.650> that<00:04:00.739> once<00:04:01.099> the<00:04:01.250> color<00:04:01.459> starts<00:04:01.699> to

00:04:01.869 --> 00:04:01.879 
the fact that once the color starts to

00:04:01.879 --> 00:04:03.969 
the fact that once the color starts to
wear<00:04:02.000> off<00:04:02.060> i'm<00:04:02.540> left<00:04:03.229> with<00:04:03.379> the<00:04:03.500> glitter<00:04:03.709> or<00:04:03.889> my

00:04:03.969 --> 00:04:03.979 
wear off i'm left with the glitter or my

00:04:03.979 --> 00:04:06.039 
wear off i'm left with the glitter or my
lips<00:04:04.190> so<00:04:04.489> you<00:04:04.549> end<00:04:04.970> up<00:04:05.030> with<00:04:05.090> just<00:04:05.329> glittery

00:04:06.039 --> 00:04:06.049 
lips so you end up with just glittery

00:04:06.049 --> 00:04:08.530 
lips so you end up with just glittery
lips<00:04:06.349> instead<00:04:06.560> of<00:04:06.799> pigmented<00:04:07.729> glittery<00:04:08.269> lips

00:04:08.530 --> 00:04:08.540 
lips instead of pigmented glittery lips

00:04:08.540 --> 00:04:10.420 
lips instead of pigmented glittery lips
I<00:04:08.780> purchase<00:04:09.440> these<00:04:09.470> I<00:04:09.799> actually<00:04:10.069> thought<00:04:10.310> that

00:04:10.420 --> 00:04:10.430 
I purchase these I actually thought that

00:04:10.430 --> 00:04:12.069 
I purchase these I actually thought that
they<00:04:10.549> were<00:04:10.639> going<00:04:10.760> to<00:04:10.819> be<00:04:10.940> more<00:04:11.329> mad<00:04:11.810> than

00:04:12.069 --> 00:04:12.079 
they were going to be more mad than

00:04:12.079 --> 00:04:14.110 
they were going to be more mad than
shimmer<00:04:12.650> um<00:04:12.979> they<00:04:13.400> do<00:04:13.459> have<00:04:13.760> a<00:04:13.790> separate

00:04:14.110 --> 00:04:14.120 
shimmer um they do have a separate

00:04:14.120 --> 00:04:15.520 
shimmer um they do have a separate
collection<00:04:14.269> like<00:04:14.599> this<00:04:14.659> that<00:04:14.989> is<00:04:15.079> called<00:04:15.319> like

00:04:15.520 --> 00:04:15.530 
collection like this that is called like

00:04:15.530 --> 00:04:17.379 
collection like this that is called like
show<00:04:15.799> me<00:04:15.949> the<00:04:16.070> shimmer<00:04:16.280> so<00:04:16.789> I<00:04:16.820> figured<00:04:17.269> that

00:04:17.379 --> 00:04:17.389 
show me the shimmer so I figured that

00:04:17.389 --> 00:04:18.670 
show me the shimmer so I figured that
that<00:04:17.419> one<00:04:17.690> would<00:04:17.810> have<00:04:17.930> all<00:04:18.109> the<00:04:18.229> glitter<00:04:18.500> and

00:04:18.670 --> 00:04:18.680 
that one would have all the glitter and

00:04:18.680 --> 00:04:20.170 
that one would have all the glitter and
shimmer<00:04:18.859> in<00:04:19.039> it<00:04:19.130> and<00:04:19.310> this<00:04:19.639> one<00:04:19.820> would<00:04:19.909> be<00:04:19.940> more

00:04:20.170 --> 00:04:20.180 
shimmer in it and this one would be more

00:04:20.180 --> 00:04:22.120 
shimmer in it and this one would be more
mac<00:04:20.359> but<00:04:20.779> if<00:04:21.019> this<00:04:21.440> one<00:04:21.680> has<00:04:21.829> this<00:04:21.979> much

00:04:22.120 --> 00:04:22.130 
mac but if this one has this much

00:04:22.130 --> 00:04:23.129 
mac but if this one has this much
glitter<00:04:22.400> in<00:04:22.580> it<00:04:22.669> I<00:04:22.849> don't<00:04:22.969> know

00:04:23.129 --> 00:04:23.139 
glitter in it I don't know

00:04:23.139 --> 00:04:24.600 
glitter in it I don't know
what<00:04:23.259> the<00:04:23.379> show<00:04:23.530> me<00:04:23.650> the<00:04:23.740> shimmer<00:04:23.919> looks<00:04:24.430> like

00:04:24.600 --> 00:04:24.610 
what the show me the shimmer looks like

00:04:24.610 --> 00:04:26.459 
what the show me the shimmer looks like
so<00:04:25.330> I<00:04:25.389> think<00:04:25.479> that<00:04:25.659> these<00:04:25.810> losses<00:04:26.020> are<00:04:26.259> pretty

00:04:26.459 --> 00:04:26.469 
so I think that these losses are pretty

00:04:26.469 --> 00:04:28.860 
so I think that these losses are pretty
decent<00:04:26.949> um<00:04:27.129> they're<00:04:27.879> not<00:04:27.999> like<00:04:28.180> a<00:04:28.330> must-have

00:04:28.860 --> 00:04:28.870 
decent um they're not like a must-have

00:04:28.870 --> 00:04:31.140 
decent um they're not like a must-have
product<00:04:29.439> for<00:04:29.590> me<00:04:29.740> personally<00:04:30.099> but<00:04:30.849> I'm<00:04:30.999> going

00:04:31.140 --> 00:04:31.150 
product for me personally but I'm going

00:04:31.150 --> 00:04:32.369 
product for me personally but I'm going
to<00:04:31.240> give<00:04:31.330> them<00:04:31.479> a<00:04:31.599> three<00:04:31.779> and<00:04:31.840> a<00:04:31.900> half<00:04:31.930> out<00:04:32.319> of

00:04:32.369 --> 00:04:32.379 
to give them a three and a half out of

to give them a three and a half out of
five<00:04:32.529> stars<00:04:32.770> I'm<00:04:33.460> simply<00:04:33.999> because<00:04:34.330> of<00:04:34.599> the

00:04:35.010 --> 00:04:35.020 
five stars I'm simply because of the

00:04:35.020 --> 00:04:36.809 
five stars I'm simply because of the
glitter<00:04:35.259> that<00:04:35.620> is<00:04:35.770> in<00:04:35.949> it<00:04:36.069> you<00:04:36.249> know<00:04:36.279> and<00:04:36.580> being

glitter that is in it you know and being
like<00:04:36.999> with<00:04:37.210> glitter<00:04:37.479> once<00:04:37.810> the<00:04:37.930> color<00:04:38.110> wears

00:04:38.339 --> 00:04:38.349 
like with glitter once the color wears

00:04:38.349 --> 00:04:40.860 
like with glitter once the color wears
off<00:04:38.590> and<00:04:38.830> also<00:04:39.279> the<00:04:39.580> price<00:04:39.849> the<00:04:40.180> price<00:04:40.210> is<00:04:40.629> just

00:04:40.860 --> 00:04:40.870 
off and also the price the price is just

00:04:40.870 --> 00:04:44.059 
off and also the price the price is just
way<00:04:41.199> too<00:04:41.259> steep<00:04:41.650> for<00:04:41.710> me<00:04:41.939> for<00:04:42.939> one<00:04:43.150> lip<00:04:43.779> gloss

00:04:44.059 --> 00:04:44.069 
way too steep for me for one lip gloss

00:04:44.069 --> 00:04:46.050 
way too steep for me for one lip gloss
other<00:04:45.069> than<00:04:45.159> that<00:04:45.249> I<00:04:45.370> do<00:04:45.490> think<00:04:45.789> that<00:04:45.819> it's<00:04:45.999> a

00:04:46.050 --> 00:04:46.060 
other than that I do think that it's a

00:04:46.060 --> 00:04:47.309 
other than that I do think that it's a
good<00:04:46.090> idea<00:04:46.270> to<00:04:46.449> start<00:04:46.689> out<00:04:46.870> with<00:04:46.900> kids<00:04:47.229> like

good idea to start out with kids like

00:04:47.319 --> 00:04:49.230 
good idea to start out with kids like
this<00:04:47.620> that<00:04:48.430> way<00:04:48.550> you<00:04:48.610> can<00:04:48.789> kind<00:04:48.999> of<00:04:49.090> get<00:04:49.210> an

00:04:49.230 --> 00:04:49.240 
this that way you can kind of get an

00:04:49.240 --> 00:04:51.809 
this that way you can kind of get an
idea<00:04:49.389> on<00:04:49.749> the<00:04:50.080> shades<00:04:50.379> that<00:04:51.340> Bare<00:04:51.610> Minerals
