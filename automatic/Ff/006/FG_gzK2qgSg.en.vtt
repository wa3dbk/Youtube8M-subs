00:00:06.890 --> 00:00:09.040
 ah 

00:00:15.100 --> 00:00:17.790
 that is 

00:00:20.770 --> 00:00:24.400
 they planted others as they are 

00:00:22.570 --> 00:00:25.990
 soldiers friend philbrick good being 

00:00:24.400 --> 00:00:29.170
 les stevie after a while ago 

00:00:25.990 --> 00:00:30.670
 that I did not upload any and good 

00:00:29.170 --> 00:00:33.610
 I was related to a little bit to 

00:00:30.670 --> 00:00:35.050
 through djs remember some friends 

00:00:33.610 --> 00:00:37.500
 that they asked me for a while 

00:00:35.050 --> 00:00:40.540
 a video to do the mailing for a 

00:00:37.500 --> 00:00:43.150
 controller that is paid where yes 

00:00:40.540 --> 00:00:44.830
 the good sv many had problems and not 

00:00:43.150 --> 00:00:47.020
 they could configure it with their mac with 

00:00:44.830 --> 00:00:49.600
 windows for virtual dj since it comes with 

00:00:47.020 --> 00:00:51.730
 so good he is uploading the video 

00:00:49.600 --> 00:00:53.530
 have some failures of that driver 

00:00:51.730 --> 00:00:57.100
 sometimes a somewhat problematic driver 

00:00:53.530 --> 00:00:59.230
 friends so the truth is recommended 

00:00:57.100 --> 00:01:01.980
 because apart from being economical it has very 

00:00:59.230 --> 00:01:04.559
 good functions brings very good things 

00:01:01.980 --> 00:01:06.030
 and good is a controller with enough 

00:01:04.559 --> 00:01:08.250
 complete but good as long as 

00:01:06.030 --> 00:01:11.369
 use with your base program that is the 

00:01:08.250 --> 00:01:13.770
 cerato dj intro which good we already know 

00:01:11.369 --> 00:01:15.479
 is has very few options has very 

00:01:13.770 --> 00:01:18.390
 few things different difference with the 

00:01:15.479 --> 00:01:19.950
 cerato full not what is the good thing that 

00:01:18.390 --> 00:01:22.380
 can show videos and more things very 

00:01:19.950 --> 00:01:25.020
 well this time it's related to a 

00:01:22.380 --> 00:01:27.930
 program that they asked me all that is the 

00:01:25.020 --> 00:01:30.300
 virtual dj 8 maybe they remind you or have 

00:01:27.930 --> 00:01:32.400
 found thousands of virtual djs 8 that 

00:01:30.300 --> 00:01:34.770
 they have problems not at 10 minutes and 

00:01:32.400 --> 00:01:36.539
 Suddenly , the audio goes away. 

00:01:34.770 --> 00:01:37.920
 Disable the driver or many things 

00:01:36.539 --> 00:01:40.710
 and well, it takes a small 

00:01:37.920 --> 00:01:41.880
 solution and I say even though you have a 

00:01:40.710 --> 00:01:43.950
 Toquilla we do not give this music 

00:01:41.880 --> 00:01:46.770
 Well, let's try to take the 

00:01:43.950 --> 00:01:49.110
 I 'm not going to leave you there in the 

00:01:46.770 --> 00:01:50.670
 the page but we right in the 

00:01:49.110 --> 00:01:52.470
 description of the video or on facebook or in 

00:01:50.670 --> 00:01:54.929
 twitter asked ask for because 

00:01:52.470 --> 00:01:56.729
 of the two in the download in case 

00:01:54.929 --> 00:01:59.039
 comes to have some problem in the 

00:01:56.729 --> 00:02:00.720
 download the virtual dj with everything 

00:01:59.039 --> 00:02:02.910
 that is going to need to be able to 

00:02:00.720 --> 00:02:04.590
 install it and why are not we going to start 

00:02:02.910 --> 00:02:06.630
 friends step number one 

00:02:04.590 --> 00:02:09.560
 let's download this folder we will 

00:02:06.630 --> 00:02:12.629
 to be something like that they realize well 

00:02:09.560 --> 00:02:13.920
 let's do antivirus already I have a 

00:02:12.629 --> 00:02:16.830
 problem so what are we going to do 

00:02:13.920 --> 00:02:18.740
 quickly nothing else is very good from 

00:02:16.830 --> 00:02:22.569
 deactivate it 

00:02:18.740 --> 00:02:24.219
 for some a few seconds 

00:02:22.569 --> 00:02:27.099
 because you have to deactivate 

00:02:24.219 --> 00:02:29.079
 temporarily the protection we are going to 

00:02:27.099 --> 00:02:34.389
 tell him that for during some that 

00:02:29.079 --> 00:02:35.980
 like 5 minutes for a lot of smart and good 

00:02:34.389 --> 00:02:37.450
 let's continue with this the 

00:02:35.980 --> 00:02:39.129
 installation is fast the first thing that 

00:02:37.450 --> 00:02:41.500
 we have to do is install what's going 

00:02:39.129 --> 00:02:44.380
 to be the virtual dj 

00:02:41.500 --> 00:02:46.270
 something very important bands disconnect 

00:02:44.380 --> 00:02:47.890
 your internet because I'm going to explain a 

00:02:46.270 --> 00:02:50.140
 little why but good disconnect 

00:02:47.890 --> 00:02:53.500
 your internet for anything we are going to 

00:02:50.140 --> 00:02:55.300
 give the typical installation what will be 

00:02:53.500 --> 00:02:57.220
 the truth quite pretty fast of 

00:02:55.300 --> 00:02:59.770
 done I as a short form is 

00:02:57.220 --> 00:03:01.060
 composed that is fast and very good 

00:02:59.770 --> 00:03:02.770
 once we have finished 

00:03:01.060 --> 00:03:05.230
 install what will be a upload where 

00:03:02.770 --> 00:03:07.840
 we no longer have to open it and what 

00:03:05.230 --> 00:03:11.140
 we are going to do is go now to what 

00:03:07.840 --> 00:03:15.510
 is going to be the folder where it was installed that 

00:03:11.140 --> 00:03:18.230
 walk around here and well let's 

00:03:15.510 --> 00:03:19.819
 to have what 

00:03:18.230 --> 00:03:23.569
 we are going to have some complications 

00:03:19.819 --> 00:03:27.379
 we are going to have to copy everything is better 

00:03:23.569 --> 00:03:30.110
 said duplicate and replace the file 

00:03:27.379 --> 00:03:32.060
 let's tell him if we 're going to say 

00:03:30.110 --> 00:03:33.739
 that we want to continue once 

00:03:32.060 --> 00:03:35.959
 replaced the file friends well 

00:03:33.739 --> 00:03:37.790
 we are going to be able to close this folder and we 

00:03:35.959 --> 00:03:40.370
 we're going to stay with the one that was downloaded 

00:03:37.790 --> 00:03:43.910
 well after that we're going to have to 

00:03:40.370 --> 00:03:45.890
 open what will be the host patch 

00:03:43.910 --> 00:03:48.079
 this serves us well to block what 

00:03:45.890 --> 00:03:50.150
 which is the hong kong once this is done 

00:03:48.079 --> 00:03:52.340
 good ready and it was nothing else you have 

00:03:50.150 --> 00:03:53.989
 have to open this form and the 

00:03:52.340 --> 00:03:55.370
 next step is obviously open what 

00:03:53.989 --> 00:03:57.470
 that is going to be the generator that is this 

00:03:55.370 --> 00:04:00.340
 that is here let's double- click 

00:03:57.470 --> 00:04:00.340
 although yes 

00:04:01.090 --> 00:04:07.450
 you will hear the mellow music 

00:04:04.220 --> 00:04:09.520
 let's say I understand generate them 

00:04:07.450 --> 00:04:12.540
 here you have to mix perfectly 

00:04:09.520 --> 00:04:12.540
 we are going to put it 

00:04:20.639 --> 00:04:24.370
 and we are going to remove the music that bothers 

00:04:22.379 --> 00:04:27.720
 it is this mechanical 

00:04:24.370 --> 00:04:29.740
 because it's better we 're going to do general 

00:04:27.720 --> 00:04:32.050
 says that our 

00:04:29.740 --> 00:04:35.080
 product will start let's see let's 

00:04:32.050 --> 00:04:37.840
 give you success ok 

00:04:35.080 --> 00:04:40.180
 ready once this done friends 

00:04:37.840 --> 00:04:42.099
 because I told them to deactivate their 

00:04:40.180 --> 00:04:44.530
 internet is good because obviously for 

00:04:42.099 --> 00:04:47.700
 open the virtual dj and what for what 

00:04:44.530 --> 00:04:49.410
 it served us better said the home all 

00:04:47.700 --> 00:04:51.510
 to block a bit what will be 

00:04:49.410 --> 00:04:52.920
 the updates or that they stop 

00:04:51.510 --> 00:04:55.890
 that we are using a virtual dj 

00:04:52.920 --> 00:04:57.540
 spinna good tone the only thing we have 

00:04:55.890 --> 00:04:59.240
 what to do is and now to open what is 

00:04:57.540 --> 00:05:02.509
 the virtual dj 

00:04:59.240 --> 00:05:04.819
 and have it run well here they have it 

00:05:02.509 --> 00:05:07.520
 friends be judo pink we're going to 

00:05:04.819 --> 00:05:09.919
 the options and well normally if this 

00:05:07.520 --> 00:05:11.810
 is well hacked or better said if not 

00:05:09.919 --> 00:05:13.729
 was well hacked into license us 

00:05:11.810 --> 00:05:15.169
 It must appear that we do not have them 

00:05:13.729 --> 00:05:17.360
 of video those of controller and that 

00:05:15.169 --> 00:05:20.389
 we must pay the many dollars for 

00:05:17.360 --> 00:05:22.430
 them and because they do not realize here anymore 

00:05:20.389 --> 00:05:25.789
 is activated the good name is a 

00:05:22.430 --> 00:05:27.380
 real name from solares is an email that 

00:05:25.789 --> 00:05:28.669
 I have you here too in 

00:05:27.380 --> 00:05:30.229
 screen I leave you I have no anger 

00:05:28.669 --> 00:05:31.729
 because some of those who write me has 

00:05:30.229 --> 00:05:33.860
 some doubt because they can write to 

00:05:31.729 --> 00:05:36.259
 not in the current license as well 

00:05:33.860 --> 00:05:38.030
 you in mind can catch me is the 

00:05:36.259 --> 00:05:40.730
 infiniti 

00:05:38.030 --> 00:05:43.430
 unlock this driver I do not need 

00:05:40.730 --> 00:05:45.410
 in the virtual infinity license 

00:05:43.430 --> 00:05:47.870
 activated in virtual subscription of pro 

00:05:45.410 --> 00:05:49.760
 unlimited content is not necessary 

00:05:47.870 --> 00:05:51.680
 Well, they already have an active license 

00:05:49.760 --> 00:05:53.900
 which is limited or unlimited audio in 

00:05:51.680 --> 00:05:55.970
 each or that limited in unlimited video 

00:05:53.900 --> 00:05:57.650
 in any thing gentlemen not the truth 

00:05:55.970 --> 00:06:00.800
 is that here they have it already total and 

00:05:57.650 --> 00:06:02.660
 completely full this virtual dj is 

00:06:00.800 --> 00:06:03.980
 working perfect they will find 

00:06:02.660 --> 00:06:05.480
 several in the network that do not have the same 

00:06:03.980 --> 00:06:08.180
 some glitches this does not have 

00:06:05.480 --> 00:06:11.330
 absolutely none and the good advantage 

00:06:08.180 --> 00:06:13.250
 for those who have the pioneer sb is that 

00:06:11.330 --> 00:06:14.780
 with this virtual I said that if you have 

00:06:13.250 --> 00:06:16.910
 a good team are not going to have any 

00:06:14.780 --> 00:06:20.510
 problem will be able to use the 

00:06:16.910 --> 00:06:23.060
 hours that are necessary with virtual dj 

00:06:20.510 --> 00:06:25.130
 8 which is only now in this 

00:06:23.060 --> 00:06:27.770
 You are currently well in full for what it is 

00:06:25.130 --> 00:06:29.330
 windows for mcdonald less not us what 

00:06:27.770 --> 00:06:31.070
 They found I have not looked well on 

00:06:29.330 --> 00:06:32.330
 The truth may already be there but 

00:06:31.070 --> 00:06:34.250
 Well, if I find it, I promise 

00:06:32.330 --> 00:06:35.990
 upload the video but good at times 

00:06:34.250 --> 00:06:38.690
 they already have it for what is the 

00:06:35.990 --> 00:06:40.610
 wii platform no and well I hope that 

00:06:38.690 --> 00:06:42.620
 you liked this video band 

00:06:40.610 --> 00:06:44.509
 remember that it's been a while since 

00:06:42.620 --> 00:06:46.400
 I came back here, but I hope that 

00:06:44.509 --> 00:06:47.750
 be of your liking and obviously it serves 

00:06:46.400 --> 00:06:50.300
 let the word spread so that good 

00:06:47.750 --> 00:06:52.219
 next year let's start with a little bit 

00:06:50.300 --> 00:06:54.889
 more than things I think that Friday 

00:06:52.219 --> 00:06:57.259
 at the latest we are already uploading new 

00:06:54.889 --> 00:06:59.629
 clicks and some small ones and for ipad's 

00:06:57.259 --> 00:07:03.530
 iphone already know clicks for what it is 

00:06:59.629 --> 00:07:05.780
 obviously also the iphone or the ipad 

00:07:03.530 --> 00:07:07.580
 which are obviously number compatible 

00:07:05.780 --> 00:07:08.900
 this to generate more large audience 

00:07:07.580 --> 00:07:10.909
 they do not forget that this channel 

00:07:08.900 --> 00:07:13.550
 is still alive and good as I said there is no 

00:07:10.909 --> 00:07:14.930
