00:00:14.820 --> 00:00:18.680
 to plant yet did not fit what to do in such 

00:00:17.520 --> 00:00:21.990

00:00:26.430 --> 00:00:34.559
 the case when between nodes here is node 20 

00:00:29.970 --> 00:00:37.829

00:00:34.559 --> 00:00:41.399

00:00:37.829 --> 00:00:44.070
 the case if the tomatoes stretches what i do 

00:00:41.399 --> 00:00:46.200
 now see let's say stretches 

00:00:44.070 --> 00:00:49.200
 Tomatoes I take a knife and cut 

00:00:46.200 --> 00:00:52.320

00:01:04.409 --> 00:01:11.100
 going on and getting out and looking 

00:01:08.250 --> 00:01:14.909

00:01:11.100 --> 00:01:19.080
 koreshochki 5 days koreshochki all this 

00:01:14.909 --> 00:01:22.049
 seedlings I can already plant here let's say 

00:01:19.080 --> 00:01:26.159
 this same glass of water in the ground all 

00:01:22.049 --> 00:01:30.150
 please grow a sample 

00:01:26.159 --> 00:01:32.250
 I see there Peneadka in this and detachment so 

00:01:30.150 --> 00:01:35.240
 already went on shots five days ago 

00:01:32.250 --> 00:01:37.799
 cut off gone-gone impact on posting 

00:01:35.240 --> 00:01:41.220
 I cut this bush 

00:01:37.799 --> 00:01:43.710
 so so so 9 today so 13 days 

00:01:41.220 --> 00:01:45.479
 won what actions see see what 

00:01:43.710 --> 00:01:47.700
 acts 2 parcel 

00:01:45.479 --> 00:01:50.549
 they can once again put the cut 

00:01:47.700 --> 00:01:52.290
 water and you can leave to grow and in 

00:01:50.549 --> 00:01:56.250
 the rest will just have to be 

00:01:52.290 --> 00:01:58.770
 lying down you need a row 

00:01:56.250 --> 00:02:01.110
 again continue to increase thereby 

00:01:58.770 --> 00:02:08.310
 number seedlings 234 

00:02:01.110 --> 00:02:10.470
 at your discretion if the grade is tomato 

00:02:08.310 --> 00:02:12.120
 the radiator is not over that is undersized 

00:02:10.470 --> 00:02:16.020
 this is tomato this way 

00:02:12.120 --> 00:02:19.020
 it is undesirable to use if high 

00:02:16.020 --> 00:02:19.950
 type de barao you or there spaceship wolf 

00:02:19.020 --> 00:02:23.550
 Tarasenko hybrid 

00:02:19.950 --> 00:02:26.640
 this method is amazingly suited 

00:02:23.550 --> 00:02:28.320
 I'm telling for beginners beginners 

00:02:26.640 --> 00:02:31.260
 so smart because the top profile 

00:02:28.320 --> 00:02:32.790
 rootlets and beginners, too, necessarily 

00:02:31.260 --> 00:02:35.209
 would be faced with the problem that whether in 

00:02:32.790 --> 00:02:38.190
 I am not pulling seedlings by this method 

00:02:35.209 --> 00:02:38.820
 used only when its like this 25 

00:02:38.190 --> 00:02:40.739
 years ago 

00:02:38.820 --> 00:02:42.600
 and I recommend it to you for the reason 

00:02:40.739 --> 00:02:44.970
 To start to consider the problem in like 

00:02:42.600 --> 00:02:48.150
 me it was 25 years ago often me 

00:02:44.970 --> 00:02:50.520
 no, at first she was me like that 

00:02:48.150 --> 00:02:51.870
 got out of position once snapped them in that 

00:02:50.520 --> 00:02:53.250
 at the same time the amount has increased 

00:02:51.870 --> 00:02:56.540
 seedlings three times 

00:02:53.250 --> 00:03:00.140
 the impact was very much have the mind 

00:02:56.540 --> 00:03:00.140
 take spring soon 

00:03:00.739 --> 00:03:06.410
 can use this method 

00:03:03.120 --> 00:03:06.410
 and so goodbye
