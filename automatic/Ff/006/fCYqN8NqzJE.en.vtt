so there's like glass and then there's

00:03:54.410 --> 00:03:58.660 
so there's like glass and then there's
water<00:03:54.680> over<00:03:54.769> it<00:03:55.190> I<00:03:57.370> was<00:03:58.370> thinking<00:03:58.610> about

00:03:58.660 --> 00:03:58.670 
water over it I was thinking about

00:03:58.670 --> 00:04:00.640 
water over it I was thinking about
making<00:03:58.940> like<00:03:59.209> a<00:03:59.239> water<00:03:59.540> slide<00:03:59.840> where<00:04:00.140> you<00:04:00.440> put

00:04:00.640 --> 00:04:00.650 
making like a water slide where you put

00:04:00.650 --> 00:04:02.979 
making like a water slide where you put
your<00:04:00.680> bulk<00:04:00.980> and<00:04:01.220> then<00:04:01.459> it<00:04:01.610> just<00:04:01.850> took<00:04:02.150> you<00:04:02.360> to<00:04:02.959> a

00:04:02.979 --> 00:04:02.989 
your bulk and then it just took you to a

00:04:02.989 --> 00:04:04.960 
your bulk and then it just took you to a
random<00:04:03.230> place<00:04:03.500> on<00:04:03.769> the<00:04:03.860> ocean<00:04:04.250> kind<00:04:04.580> of<00:04:04.730> in<00:04:04.850> a

00:04:04.960 --> 00:04:04.970 
random place on the ocean kind of in a

00:04:04.970 --> 00:04:09.780 
random place on the ocean kind of in a
fun<00:04:05.269> way<00:04:05.650> but<00:04:06.650> then<00:04:06.799> overs<00:04:07.130> back<00:04:07.370> over<00:04:07.730> here

00:04:09.780 --> 00:04:09.790 
fun way but then overs back over here

00:04:09.790 --> 00:04:12.860 
fun way but then overs back over here
yeah<00:04:10.569> I<00:04:10.810> think<00:04:10.930> this<00:04:11.140> is<00:04:11.319> pretty<00:04:11.469> cool<00:04:11.590> but

00:04:12.860 --> 00:04:12.870
