00:00:35.690 --> 00:00:35.700 
our home screens so let's start with

00:00:35.700 --> 00:00:37.700 
our home screens so let's start with
wallpapers<00:00:36.480> now<00:00:36.719> we've<00:00:36.899> done<00:00:37.079> another<00:00:37.350> video

00:00:37.700 --> 00:00:37.710

primarily<00:00:38.340> on<00:00:38.670> wallpapers<00:00:39.570> but<00:00:40.200> it's<00:00:40.350> quite

00:00:40.549 --> 00:00:40.559 
primarily on wallpapers but it's quite

00:00:40.559 --> 00:00:42.200 
primarily on wallpapers but it's quite
straightforward<00:00:40.950> in<00:00:41.370> the<00:00:41.489> fact<00:00:41.700> that<00:00:41.790> you<00:00:42.000> can

00:00:42.200 --> 00:00:42.210 
straightforward in the fact that you can

00:00:42.210 --> 00:00:44.660 
straightforward in the fact that you can
select<00:00:42.420> from<00:00:42.660> some<00:00:43.410> preinstalled<00:00:43.800> ones<00:00:44.370> or

00:00:44.660 --> 00:00:44.670 
select from some preinstalled ones or

00:00:44.670 --> 00:00:47.750 
select from some preinstalled ones or
you<00:00:45.329> can<00:00:45.570> select<00:00:45.750> from<00:00:46.020> your<00:00:46.649> gallery<00:00:46.860> or<00:00:47.399> live

00:01:25.500 --> 00:01:27.530 
different screen well i can't add it
there<00:01:25.530> because<00:01:25.890> that<00:01:26.400> that<00:01:26.759> screen<00:01:27.119> is<00:01:27.299> is

00:01:27.530 --> 00:01:27.540 
there because that that screen is is

00:01:27.540 --> 00:01:29.719 
there because that that screen is is
full<00:01:27.930> but<00:01:28.560> i<00:01:28.650> can<00:01:28.799> drag<00:01:28.979> it<00:01:29.159> around<00:01:29.220> to<00:01:29.490> another

00:01:29.719 --> 00:01:29.729

00:01:29.729 --> 00:01:31.910 
full but i can drag it around to another
screen<00:01:30.030> and<00:01:30.450> i<00:01:30.900> can<00:01:31.140> put<00:01:31.290> it<00:01:31.409> there<00:01:31.890> for

00:01:31.910 --> 00:01:31.920 
screen and i can put it there for

00:01:31.920 --> 00:01:34.789 
screen and i can put it there for
example<00:01:32.670> and<00:01:32.880> let<00:01:33.329> go<00:01:33.570> and<00:01:34.110> then<00:01:34.439> i'm<00:01:34.560> back

00:01:34.789 --> 00:01:34.799 
example and let go and then i'm back

00:01:34.799 --> 00:01:38.230 
example and let go and then i'm back
here<00:01:35.540> so<00:01:36.540> that's<00:01:37.110> the<00:01:37.320> primary<00:01:37.590> way<00:01:37.920> to
