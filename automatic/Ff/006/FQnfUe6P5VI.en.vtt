00:00:00.469 --> 00:00:02.750 

in<00:00:01.469> this<00:00:01.650> video<00:00:01.860> I'm<00:00:02.310> going<00:00:02.490> to<00:00:02.580> demonstrate

00:00:02.750 --> 00:00:02.760 
in this video I'm going to demonstrate

00:00:02.760 --> 00:00:14.140 
in this video I'm going to demonstrate
how<00:00:03.389> to<00:00:03.419> use<00:00:03.870> the<00:00:04.140> airlift<00:00:04.910> by<00:00:05.910> you<00:00:06.390> view

00:00:14.140 --> 00:00:14.150 

00:00:14.150 --> 00:00:16.269 

the<00:00:14.990> first<00:00:15.290> thing<00:00:15.470> that<00:00:15.620> we<00:00:15.680> need<00:00:15.800> to<00:00:15.920> do<00:00:16.070> when

00:00:16.269 --> 00:00:16.279 
the first thing that we need to do when

00:00:16.279 --> 00:00:19.990 
the first thing that we need to do when
using<00:00:16.400> the<00:00:17.020> the<00:00:18.020> airlift<00:00:18.380> is<00:00:18.680> to<00:00:19.340> select<00:00:19.760> the

00:00:19.990 --> 00:00:20.000 
using the the airlift is to select the

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:28.330 
using the the airlift is to select the
proper<00:00:20.470> grommet<00:00:22.240> so<00:00:23.240> this<00:00:23.480> valve<00:00:23.779> body<00:00:27.340> fits

00:00:28.330 --> 00:00:28.340 
proper grommet so this valve body fits

00:00:28.340 --> 00:00:34.479 
proper grommet so this valve body fits
in<00:00:28.550> our<00:00:28.939> coolant<00:00:29.390> reservoir<00:00:29.540> tank<00:00:30.340> or<00:00:31.720> in<00:00:33.489> the

00:00:34.479 --> 00:00:34.489 
in our coolant reservoir tank or in the

00:00:34.489 --> 00:00:41.950 
in our coolant reservoir tank or in the
radiator<00:00:36.850> now<00:00:37.850> we<00:00:37.910> need<00:00:38.149> to<00:00:38.239> tighten<00:00:38.540> up<00:00:40.960> I'll

00:00:41.950 --> 00:00:41.960 
radiator now we need to tighten up I'll

00:00:41.960 --> 00:00:43.450 
radiator now we need to tighten up I'll
call<00:00:42.260> it<00:00:42.380> the<00:00:42.500> valve<00:00:42.680> body<00:00:42.980> I<00:00:43.130> don't<00:00:43.219> know<00:00:43.340> what

00:00:43.450 --> 00:00:43.460 
call it the valve body I don't know what

00:00:43.460 --> 00:00:44.500 
call it the valve body I don't know what
it's<00:00:43.579> called<00:00:43.730> but<00:00:43.969> we're<00:00:44.059> going<00:00:44.149> to<00:00:44.239> tighten

00:00:44.500 --> 00:00:44.510 
it's called but we're going to tighten

00:00:44.510 --> 00:00:46.439 
it's called but we're going to tighten
up<00:00:44.540> the<00:00:44.630> valve<00:00:44.840> body<00:00:45.110> to<00:00:45.260> make<00:00:45.380> a<00:00:45.410> nice<00:00:45.649> seal

00:00:46.439 --> 00:00:46.449 
up the valve body to make a nice seal

00:00:46.449 --> 00:00:48.759 
up the valve body to make a nice seal
between<00:00:47.449> the<00:00:47.600> valve<00:00:47.690> body<00:00:48.140> and<00:00:48.379> the<00:00:48.440> coolant

00:00:48.759 --> 00:00:48.769 
between the valve body and the coolant

00:00:48.769 --> 00:00:52.550 
between the valve body and the coolant
tank

00:00:52.550 --> 00:00:52.560 

00:00:52.560 --> 00:00:57.979 

next<00:00:53.310> you<00:00:53.400> attach<00:00:53.790> the<00:00:55.490> fittings<00:00:56.630> so<00:00:57.630> you<00:00:57.720> can

00:00:57.979 --> 00:00:57.989 
next you attach the fittings so you can

00:00:57.989 --> 00:01:01.460 
next you attach the fittings so you can
connect<00:00:58.500> shop<00:00:58.860> air<00:00:59.220> and<00:00:59.690> draw<00:01:00.690> a<00:01:00.720> vacuum<00:01:01.380> on

00:01:01.460 --> 00:01:01.470 
connect shop air and draw a vacuum on

00:01:01.470 --> 00:01:08.700 
connect shop air and draw a vacuum on
the<00:01:01.559> system

00:01:08.700 --> 00:01:08.710 

00:01:08.710 --> 00:01:12.120 

attach<00:01:09.460> the<00:01:09.700> shop<00:01:09.940> air<00:01:10.500> to<00:01:11.500> start<00:01:11.680> drawing<00:01:12.040> a

00:01:12.120 --> 00:01:12.130 
attach the shop air to start drawing a

00:01:12.130 --> 00:01:20.610 
attach the shop air to start drawing a
vacuum<00:01:18.060> we<00:01:19.060> can<00:01:19.240> see<00:01:19.420> the<00:01:19.570> vacuum<00:01:19.750> happening

00:01:20.610 --> 00:01:20.620 
vacuum we can see the vacuum happening

00:01:20.620 --> 00:01:46.380 
vacuum we can see the vacuum happening
we<00:01:20.770> want<00:01:21.010> to<00:01:21.100> get<00:01:21.220> it<00:01:21.340> up<00:01:21.430> to<00:01:21.490> 25<00:01:22.090> psi

00:01:46.380 --> 00:01:46.390 

00:01:46.390 --> 00:01:48.969 

now<00:01:47.390> we'll<00:01:47.570> let<00:01:47.750> that<00:01:47.780> sit<00:01:47.960> for<00:01:48.439> a<00:01:48.470> few<00:01:48.530> minutes

00:01:48.969 --> 00:01:48.979 
now we'll let that sit for a few minutes

00:01:48.979 --> 00:01:51.310 
now we'll let that sit for a few minutes
to<00:01:49.159> make<00:01:49.310> sure<00:01:49.460> that<00:01:49.640> our<00:01:49.759> system<00:01:50.210> is<00:01:50.420> airtight

00:01:51.310 --> 00:01:51.320 
to make sure that our system is airtight

00:01:51.320 --> 00:01:55.179 
to make sure that our system is airtight
and<00:01:51.880> therefore<00:01:52.880> watertight<00:01:53.799> we've<00:01:54.799> tested

00:01:55.179 --> 00:01:55.189 
and therefore watertight we've tested

00:01:55.189 --> 00:01:58.020 
and therefore watertight we've tested
the<00:01:55.520> system<00:01:55.700> and<00:01:56.350> we<00:01:57.350> know<00:01:57.500> that<00:01:57.680> it's

00:01:58.020 --> 00:01:58.030 
the system and we know that it's

00:01:58.030 --> 00:02:02.560 
the system and we know that it's
airtight<00:02:00.070> so<00:02:01.070> we<00:02:01.250> need<00:02:01.429> to<00:02:01.610> now<00:02:01.850> attach<00:02:02.270> the

00:02:02.560 --> 00:02:02.570 
airtight so we need to now attach the

00:02:02.570 --> 00:02:10.380 
airtight so we need to now attach the
fill<00:02:02.840> adapter

00:02:10.380 --> 00:02:10.390 

00:02:10.390 --> 00:02:22.460 

what<00:02:11.020> we<00:02:11.140> need<00:02:11.290> to<00:02:11.410> do<00:02:11.560> with<00:02:11.710> the<00:02:11.800> Philadelphia

00:02:22.460 --> 00:02:22.470 

00:02:22.470 --> 00:02:24.590 

so<00:02:23.040> we're<00:02:23.490> going<00:02:23.580> to<00:02:23.670> submerge<00:02:24.210> it<00:02:24.420> in<00:02:24.510> the

00:02:24.590 --> 00:02:24.600 
so we're going to submerge it in the

00:02:24.600 --> 00:02:26.060 
so we're going to submerge it in the
bucket<00:02:24.780> and<00:02:25.110> then<00:02:25.440> we're<00:02:25.590> going<00:02:25.680> to<00:02:25.740> close

00:02:26.060 --> 00:02:26.070 
bucket and then we're going to close

00:02:26.070 --> 00:02:28.970 
bucket and then we're going to close
this<00:02:26.430> valve<00:02:26.670> and<00:02:27.260> that's<00:02:28.260> going<00:02:28.440> to<00:02:28.500> keep<00:02:28.710> that

00:02:28.970 --> 00:02:28.980 
this valve and that's going to keep that

00:02:28.980 --> 00:02:45.589 
this valve and that's going to keep that
tube<00:02:29.250> full<00:02:29.700> of<00:02:30.200> coolant

00:02:45.589 --> 00:02:45.599 

00:02:45.599 --> 00:02:48.790 

open<00:02:46.230> up<00:02:46.290> the<00:02:46.439> vacuum

00:02:48.790 --> 00:02:48.800 
open up the vacuum

00:02:48.800 --> 00:02:50.860 
open up the vacuum
and<00:02:49.220> then<00:02:49.460> strut<00:02:49.790> start<00:02:50.300> drawing<00:02:50.600> in<00:02:50.780> the

00:02:50.860 --> 00:02:50.870 
and then strut start drawing in the

00:02:50.870 --> 00:02:57.280 
and then strut start drawing in the
coolant

00:02:57.280 --> 00:02:57.290 

00:02:57.290 --> 00:03:00.830 

when<00:02:58.290> the<00:02:58.409> needle<00:02:58.950> reaches<00:02:59.549> zero<00:02:59.879> we<00:03:00.450> know<00:03:00.659> the

00:03:00.830 --> 00:03:00.840 
when the needle reaches zero we know the

00:03:00.840 --> 00:03:08.940 
when the needle reaches zero we know the
system<00:03:01.049> is<00:03:01.260> full

00:03:08.940 --> 00:03:08.950 

00:03:08.950 --> 00:03:12.809 

we're<00:03:09.520> at<00:03:09.700> zero

00:03:12.809 --> 00:03:12.819 

00:03:12.819 --> 00:03:18.450 

the<00:03:13.330> system<00:03:13.689> is<00:03:13.810> full<00:03:14.939> that<00:03:15.939> was<00:03:16.090> that<00:03:16.239> easy
