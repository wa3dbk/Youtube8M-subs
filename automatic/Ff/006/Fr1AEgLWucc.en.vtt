they want with Korra because I don't
really<00:01:42.270> think<00:01:42.479> we've<00:01:42.780> got<00:01:42.960> any<00:01:43.200> more

00:01:43.490 --> 00:01:43.500 
really think we've got any more

00:01:43.500 --> 00:01:48.380 
really think we've got any more
information<00:01:44.159> on<00:01:44.340> why<00:01:45.329> they<00:01:45.570> went<00:01:45.750> core<00:01:47.390> from

00:01:48.380 --> 00:01:48.390 
information on why they went core from

00:01:48.390 --> 00:01:50.569 
information on why they went core from
this<00:01:48.600> episode<00:01:48.780> then<00:01:49.350> that<00:01:50.070> we<00:01:50.189> already<00:01:50.340> had

00:01:50.569 --> 00:01:50.579 
this episode then that we already had

00:01:50.579 --> 00:01:53.359 
this episode then that we already had
really<00:01:51.500> firstly<00:01:52.500> I<00:01:52.530> think<00:01:52.920> we<00:01:53.040> should<00:01:53.070> mention

00:01:53.359 --> 00:01:53.369 
really firstly I think we should mention

00:01:53.369 --> 00:01:55.460 
really firstly I think we should mention
how<00:01:53.700> powerful<00:01:54.180> combustion<00:01:54.659> guards<00:01:55.049> because

00:01:55.460 --> 00:01:55.470 
how powerful combustion guards because

00:01:55.470 --> 00:01:57.350 
how powerful combustion guards because
she<00:01:55.649> was<00:01:55.799> able<00:01:56.040> to<00:01:56.100> take<00:01:56.280> out<00:01:56.490> sukas<00:01:56.729> dragon

00:01:57.350 --> 00:01:57.360 
she was able to take out sukas dragon

00:01:57.360 --> 00:01:59.539 
she was able to take out sukas dragon
it's<00:01:58.140> obvious<00:01:58.500> they're<00:01:58.680> after<00:01:58.860> core<00:01:59.219> but<00:01:59.399> it's

00:01:59.539 --> 00:01:59.549 
it's obvious they're after core but it's

00:01:59.549 --> 00:02:01.490 
it's obvious they're after core but it's
just<00:01:59.850> not<00:01:59.909> clear<00:02:00.180> why<00:02:00.479> this<00:02:00.540> at<00:02:01.110> this<00:02:01.290> point

00:02:01.490 --> 00:02:01.500 
just not clear why this at this point

00:02:01.500 --> 00:02:05.030 
just not clear why this at this point
why<00:02:02.030> so<00:02:03.030> here<00:02:03.270> seems<00:02:03.659> very<00:02:04.259> interested<00:02:04.469> in<00:02:04.920> the

00:02:05.030 --> 00:02:05.040 
why so here seems very interested in the

00:02:05.040 --> 00:02:06.770
