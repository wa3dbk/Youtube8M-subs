00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.410
 so warm here for the first part of 

00:00:02.490 --> 00:00:05.400
 a total of four episodes of a small one 

00:00:04.410 --> 00:00:08.730
 park opening series 

00:00:05.400 --> 00:00:10.559
 i gave it on thursday in the release so on 

00:00:08.730 --> 00:00:12.210
 correct release of fifa 15 

00:00:10.559 --> 00:00:14.250
 first course with a bit field 

00:00:12.210 --> 00:00:16.170
 point on the little hewed together 

00:00:14.250 --> 00:00:17.730
 with ron and maxi and probably will 

00:00:16.170 --> 00:00:19.109
 no way around the high long alone 

00:00:17.730 --> 00:00:20.850
 the Bundestag a youtube channel here 

00:00:19.109 --> 00:00:24.359
 It does not matter that you finally have nothing to do with it 

00:00:20.850 --> 00:00:25.289
 The thing was more or less successful 

00:00:24.359 --> 00:00:27.150
 I can not really 

00:00:25.289 --> 00:00:29.519
 Complaining okay was a lot going on 

00:00:27.150 --> 00:00:32.489
 I put in there for 12,000 

00:00:29.519 --> 00:00:35.489
 fifa points but ok your name good 

00:00:32.489 --> 00:00:38.520
 Player was the episode on everyone 

00:00:35.489 --> 00:00:40.850
 case in 518 even thunderstorms and so on 

00:00:38.520 --> 00:00:44.190
 in between with 82 83 also there 

00:00:40.850 --> 00:00:46.770
 84 I think so, yes that's coming 

00:00:44.190 --> 00:00:49.500
 So definitely there have been times 

00:00:46.770 --> 00:00:50.789
 that's why I want worse paperlinx 

00:00:49.500 --> 00:00:54.059
 First of all, do not complain to me 

00:00:50.789 --> 00:00:56.340
 have now relatively good instead of so far 

00:00:54.059 --> 00:00:57.719
 by packaging too much 15 

00:00:56.340 --> 00:00:59.940
 but that's why it's supposed to be 

00:00:57.719 --> 00:01:01.469
 I did not want to go because today he 

00:00:59.940 --> 00:01:02.670
 So first I have a series 

00:01:01.469 --> 00:01:05.930
 suggestion while in the background that 

00:01:02.670 --> 00:01:09.210
 work necessarily and that should be this series 

00:01:05.930 --> 00:01:11.040
 handicap leaves are hot first that is 

00:01:09.210 --> 00:01:15.689
 then a handy capulet m handicapped 

00:01:11.040 --> 00:01:16.799
 should then run so that the wait to 

00:01:15.689 --> 00:01:18.990
 Unfortunately glory will not take place 

00:01:16.799 --> 00:01:22.020
 due to no transfer offers and 

00:01:18.990 --> 00:01:23.490
 Consulting co forbidden everything 

00:01:22.020 --> 00:01:25.409
 you probably yourself because of that 

00:01:23.490 --> 00:01:27.869
 somehow tries a new series 

00:01:25.409 --> 00:01:30.570
 imagine where you are against me more 

00:01:27.869 --> 00:01:33.150
 or less points can play that 

00:01:30.570 --> 00:01:34.110
 is a bit more complicated 

00:01:33.150 --> 00:01:35.670
 I front of me 

00:01:34.110 --> 00:01:37.530
 So quickly rather complicated 

00:01:35.670 --> 00:01:41.210
 imagine past so complicated 

00:01:37.530 --> 00:01:43.890
 maybe that should work like that 

00:01:41.210 --> 00:01:46.079
 Just ask me if he wants it 

00:01:43.890 --> 00:01:50.220
 wanted to participate as well as with me 

00:01:46.079 --> 00:01:53.790
 was and then I read the following first 

00:01:50.220 --> 00:01:57.000
 then you have to pay 1001 because with 

00:01:53.790 --> 00:01:59.670
 you can participate and that his 

00:01:57.000 --> 00:02:02.070
 1001 so for one oled there are three 

00:01:59.670 --> 00:02:06.420
 categories of roulette that one 

00:02:02.070 --> 00:02:10.250
 roulette the mobile phone capulets is reputable 

00:02:06.420 --> 00:02:12.380
 is crazy you can then you 

00:02:10.250 --> 00:02:15.350
 So a recipe is the cheapest one 

00:02:12.380 --> 00:02:17.570
 set and the prices are not always so 

00:02:15.350 --> 00:02:19.310
 about just before commission clock 

00:02:17.570 --> 00:02:22.400
 Now on his cellphone capulet for me 

00:02:19.310 --> 00:02:24.890
 that I like a handicap for example 

00:02:22.400 --> 00:02:26.210
 from the team level, that's me 

00:02:24.890 --> 00:02:29.959
 this should be this team itself 

00:02:26.210 --> 00:02:31.250
 can not exceed then against you 

00:02:29.959 --> 00:02:35.930
 can you still have a second mobile phone 

00:02:31.250 --> 00:02:37.790
 buy capulet for me and no 

00:02:35.930 --> 00:02:41.450
 Aware of a healthy particular style of play or 

00:02:37.790 --> 00:02:42.830
 so I can not play a low passports 

00:02:41.450 --> 00:02:43.820
 or not at all flank or what also 

00:02:42.830 --> 00:02:46.520
 always mean having the 

00:02:43.820 --> 00:02:50.030
 probably decide and then there 

00:02:46.520 --> 00:02:53.600
 it probably and tabletop vision 

00:02:50.030 --> 00:02:54.890
 game and as rich as rich 

00:02:53.600 --> 00:02:58.160
 For example, if I investigate 

00:02:54.890 --> 00:03:01.130
 that you can do that and each one 

00:02:58.160 --> 00:03:03.530
 for that would have to stop certain points 

00:03:01.130 --> 00:03:06.760
 so with kÃ¶lns you pay with it then 

00:03:03.530 --> 00:03:08.870
 that and the roulette can get 

00:03:06.760 --> 00:03:13.550
 There is always a total of every episode 

00:03:08.870 --> 00:03:15.590
 50 degrees to win for you so with 50 

00:03:13.550 --> 00:03:18.799
 km and if you like the 

00:03:15.590 --> 00:03:20.870
 want to buy plates so buy in the 

00:03:18.799 --> 00:03:22.400
 end effect is the chance that we 

00:03:20.870 --> 00:03:25.340
 win if I keep up with him 

00:03:22.400 --> 00:03:28.910
 the maximum allowed to play is 30 emi and 

00:03:25.340 --> 00:03:31.430
 I can not play passports because of that 

00:03:28.910 --> 00:03:34.250
 Of course, it makes more sense last 

00:03:31.430 --> 00:03:37.850
 to buy no idea a total of 20 the 

00:03:34.250 --> 00:03:39.230
 The prices that are too serious then I will 

00:03:37.850 --> 00:03:42.440
 set again later but first time 

00:03:39.230 --> 00:03:44.750
 as a small idea then he only has 

00:03:42.440 --> 00:03:46.100
 as a total win 30k but the chance is 

00:03:44.750 --> 00:03:48.110
 yes, this audacity really 

00:03:46.100 --> 00:03:52.640
 winning is of course higher then 

00:03:48.110 --> 00:03:54.110
 that he then loses and that was 

00:03:52.640 --> 00:03:55.280
 Simply this money not so 

00:03:54.110 --> 00:03:56.090
 hope complicates most especially 

00:03:55.280 --> 00:03:57.769
 on that understood 

00:03:56.090 --> 00:03:59.750
 if you still have any 

00:03:57.769 --> 00:04:02.420
 refinement ideas for this idea 

00:03:59.750 --> 00:04:04.519
 Refinements for this idea like in 

00:04:02.420 --> 00:04:06.170
 The comments can also be written 

00:04:04.519 --> 00:04:08.750
 like to be in the comments anyway 

00:04:06.170 --> 00:04:12.860
 on youtube gives so handicap roulette 

00:04:08.750 --> 00:04:17.000
 moderately the pink slip is a pinkie 

00:04:12.860 --> 00:04:19.880
 handicap roulette you have seen 

00:04:17.000 --> 00:04:21.650
 then this series gets so violent 

00:04:19.880 --> 00:04:23.240
 but he can be quite like yesterday 

00:04:21.650 --> 00:04:23.780
 cool before you could place comments 

00:04:23.240 --> 00:04:27.500
 write 

00:04:23.780 --> 00:04:28.940
 from this idea holds and more or 

00:04:27.500 --> 00:04:31.190
 there is not much more right now 

00:04:28.940 --> 00:04:33.020
 Nothing to say when the idea is 

00:04:31.190 --> 00:04:34.430
 Yesterday just spontaneously invaded and 

00:04:33.020 --> 00:04:37.400
 Actually she is not 

00:04:34.430 --> 00:04:38.780
 so shit if he is a bit like that 

00:04:37.400 --> 00:04:40.190
 a little bit of you flow 

00:04:38.780 --> 00:04:43.820
 lets it might a little bit better 

00:04:40.190 --> 00:04:45.820
 I'm going to be that kind of 

00:04:43.820 --> 00:04:48.350
 relatively cool series 

00:04:45.820 --> 00:04:49.370
 the total prices you should me 

00:04:48.350 --> 00:04:50.960
 not trance I know now 

00:04:49.370 --> 00:04:52.910
 said had those were just so 

00:04:50.960 --> 00:04:56.270
 No idea just stupid therefore 

00:04:52.910 --> 00:04:58.820
 we'll pay that way 

00:04:56.270 --> 00:05:00.890
 on my part 250 km just because 

00:04:58.820 --> 00:05:01.960
 Whatsoever, so what? 

00:05:00.890 --> 00:05:05.180
 are prohibited 

00:05:01.960 --> 00:05:06.650
 and I think 100 to 100 from 100 km 

00:05:05.180 --> 00:05:08.530
 for the player out of time and will that 

00:05:06.650 --> 00:05:10.520
 with that when he is pretty fast 

00:05:08.530 --> 00:05:12.230
 That's why I have to 

00:05:10.520 --> 00:05:16.010
 think about it the best way 

00:05:12.230 --> 00:05:18.740
 but makes such a big course with the course 

00:05:16.010 --> 00:05:21.860
 All this was the whole idea now 

00:05:18.740 --> 00:05:23.270
 not to the super spectacular as well 

00:05:21.860 --> 00:05:24.260
 like the packs are now in the background 

00:05:23.270 --> 00:05:25.669
 have seen or not seen 

00:05:24.260 --> 00:05:27.770
 continue to have heard or 

00:05:25.669 --> 00:05:30.410
 have ever heard to this point, the 

00:05:27.770 --> 00:05:31.370
 packs were not spectacular but then 

00:05:30.410 --> 00:05:33.470
 but actually quite good, I think 

00:05:31.370 --> 00:05:35.330
 now we are allowed to do the best 

00:05:33.470 --> 00:05:37.280
 players pull and debts 

00:05:35.330 --> 00:05:39.860
 taken have indeed been pulled or 

00:05:37.280 --> 00:05:42.979
 I do not know, I think now 

00:05:39.860 --> 00:05:44.810
 now now a-ha jerome boateng 

00:05:42.979 --> 00:05:49.039
 was the best player with a total of 31 

00:05:44.810 --> 00:05:52.430
 equal manufactures yes then it tingles 

00:05:49.039 --> 00:05:52.910
 was the second most expensive with 20k and always 

00:05:52.430 --> 00:05:57.110
 so 

00:05:52.910 --> 00:05:59.030
 7 or 8 k or 4 k a connection i 

00:05:57.110 --> 00:06:02.930
 now believe sick budget of 200 

00:05:59.030 --> 00:06:04.010
 blablabla coins 1000 of course with it 

00:06:02.930 --> 00:06:05.200
 can you do one or the other? 

00:06:04.010 --> 00:06:07.850
 deal with 

00:06:05.200 --> 00:06:10.640
 You will be in the run of the neighbor 

00:06:07.850 --> 00:06:12.380
 tomorrow then see the second aspect 

00:06:10.640 --> 00:06:13.039
 would like to try a second series 

00:06:12.380 --> 00:06:16.180
 to explain 

00:06:13.039 --> 00:06:18.260
 demir has written a subscriber only 

00:06:16.180 --> 00:06:20.150
 I also thought that was cool 

00:06:18.260 --> 00:06:22.100
 I'll be there even change from Sun 

00:06:20.150 --> 00:06:23.419
 It should have and in series like 

00:06:22.100 --> 00:06:25.580
 you get the comments already what you 

00:06:23.419 --> 00:06:29.150
 think of it and then tomorrow 

00:06:25.580 --> 00:06:31.820
 same generally require more already 

00:06:29.150 --> 00:06:33.650
 said career mode motto floridas has 

00:06:31.820 --> 00:06:35.430
 have the morning to do with the thing 

00:06:33.650 --> 00:06:38.430
 Maybe now 

00:06:35.430 --> 00:06:42.140
 this handicap roulette then 

00:06:38.430 --> 00:06:46.740
 something said yet written 

00:06:42.140 --> 00:06:49.830
 naturally pulled into shape 

00:06:46.740 --> 00:06:50.640
 aha which way i still do not say it 

00:06:49.830 --> 00:06:52.890
 was not Ronaldo 

00:06:50.640 --> 00:06:54.450
 I can tell you that once as 

00:06:52.890 --> 00:06:57.030
 footballer but what I am again 

00:06:54.450 --> 00:07:01.100
 from this positive and therefore positive 

00:06:57.030 --> 00:07:01.100
 I say temporarily at least Zschau
