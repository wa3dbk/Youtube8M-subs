00:04:19.420 --> 00:04:19.430 

00:04:19.430 --> 00:04:22.640 

make<00:04:20.430> the<00:04:20.700> sausage<00:04:21.090> for<00:04:21.420> the<00:04:21.450> arms<00:04:21.959> and<00:04:22.110> glued

00:04:22.640 --> 00:04:22.650 
make the sausage for the arms and glued

00:04:22.650 --> 00:04:24.260 
make the sausage for the arms and glued
them<00:04:22.800> to<00:04:23.040> the<00:04:23.070> board<00:04:23.400> with<00:04:23.640> edible<00:04:24.060> glue

00:04:24.260 --> 00:04:24.270 
them to the board with edible glue

00:04:24.270 --> 00:04:27.070 
them to the board with edible glue
leaving<00:04:24.720> the<00:04:24.840> rest<00:04:25.110> until<00:04:25.950> it<00:04:26.340> is<00:04:26.550> all<00:04:26.760> dry

00:04:27.070 --> 00:04:27.080 
leaving the rest until it is all dry

00:04:27.080 --> 00:04:29.840 
leaving the rest until it is all dry
this<00:04:28.080> process<00:04:28.680> could<00:04:28.800> take<00:04:28.860> even<00:04:29.370> a<00:04:29.460> couple<00:04:29.700> of

00:04:29.840 --> 00:04:29.850 
this process could take even a couple of

00:04:29.850 --> 00:04:32.240 
this process could take even a couple of
days<00:04:30.090> it<00:04:30.360> depends<00:04:30.720> where<00:04:30.900> you<00:04:31.080> live<00:04:31.290> I<00:04:31.530> mean<00:04:31.710> if

00:04:32.240 --> 00:04:32.250 
days it depends where you live I mean if

00:04:32.250 --> 00:04:35.270 
days it depends where you live I mean if
you<00:04:32.490> live<00:04:32.700> in<00:04:32.880> a<00:04:33.000> more<00:04:33.300> humid<00:04:33.870> place<00:04:34.260> it<00:04:35.070> could

00:04:35.270 --> 00:04:35.280 
you live in a more humid place it could

00:04:35.280 --> 00:04:38.680 
you live in a more humid place it could
take<00:04:35.520> even<00:04:36.270> longer<00:04:36.450> sometimes<00:04:37.050> even<00:04:37.770> a<00:04:37.830> week

00:04:38.680 --> 00:04:38.690 
take even longer sometimes even a week

00:04:38.690 --> 00:04:41.600 
take even longer sometimes even a week
so<00:04:39.690> we<00:04:39.870> can<00:04:40.050> insert<00:04:40.410> the<00:04:40.470> head<00:04:40.830> and<00:04:41.220> start

00:04:41.600 --> 00:04:41.610 
so we can insert the head and start

00:04:41.610 --> 00:04:43.720 
so we can insert the head and start
making<00:04:41.970> the<00:04:42.090> braids<00:04:42.360> with<00:04:42.600> free<00:04:42.900> sausages

00:04:43.720 --> 00:04:43.730 
making the braids with free sausages

00:04:43.730 --> 00:04:47.150 
making the braids with free sausages
what<00:04:44.730> I<00:04:44.760> use<00:04:45.120> is<00:04:45.390> some<00:04:45.660> white<00:04:46.320> modeling<00:04:46.950> paste

00:04:47.150 --> 00:04:47.160 
what I use is some white modeling paste

00:04:47.160 --> 00:04:50.720 
what I use is some white modeling paste
and<00:04:47.670> then<00:04:48.660> I've<00:04:49.380> colored<00:04:49.920> it<00:04:50.130> with<00:04:50.160> a<00:04:50.370> little

00:04:50.720 --> 00:04:50.730 
and then I've colored it with a little

00:04:50.730 --> 00:04:53.330 
and then I've colored it with a little
bit<00:04:50.910> of<00:04:51.000> ivory<00:04:51.390> and<00:04:51.690> a<00:04:52.290> tiny<00:04:52.560> bit<00:04:52.710> of<00:04:52.980> yellow

00:04:53.330 --> 00:04:53.340 
bit of ivory and a tiny bit of yellow

00:04:53.340 --> 00:04:56.600 
bit of ivory and a tiny bit of yellow
gel<00:04:53.640> paste<00:04:53.850> and<00:04:54.680> then<00:04:55.680> I<00:04:55.890> think<00:04:56.160> everyone

00:04:56.600 --> 00:04:56.610 
gel paste and then I think everyone

00:04:56.610 --> 00:04:59.300 
gel paste and then I think everyone
knows<00:04:56.790> how<00:04:56.940> to<00:04:57.000> make<00:04:57.240> a<00:04:57.300> braid<00:04:57.630> right<00:04:58.250> so<00:04:59.250> she

00:04:59.300 --> 00:04:59.310 
knows how to make a braid right so she

00:04:59.310 --> 00:05:02.480 
knows how to make a braid right so she
looks<00:04:59.610> a<00:04:59.760> bit<00:04:59.790> weird<00:04:59.970> smell<00:05:00.720> I<00:05:01.020> know<00:05:01.290> but<00:05:02.220> the

00:05:02.480 --> 00:05:02.490 
looks a bit weird smell I know but the

00:05:02.490 --> 00:05:05.090 
looks a bit weird smell I know but the
more<00:05:02.670> details<00:05:03.120> we're<00:05:03.330> adding<00:05:03.720> the<00:05:04.080> more<00:05:04.440> human

00:05:05.090 --> 00:05:05.100
