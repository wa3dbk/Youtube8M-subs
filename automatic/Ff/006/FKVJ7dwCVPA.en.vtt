00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.140
 and we continue to talk about sport a 

00:00:03.270 --> 00:00:06.509
 hobby 

00:00:04.140 --> 00:00:09.000
 already thought of flying a plane without leaving 

00:00:06.509 --> 00:00:11.250
 the good ground somehow this is 

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:13.799
 possible and the opportunity is 

00:00:11.250 --> 00:00:16.170
 aeromodelling practice of small 

00:00:13.799 --> 00:00:18.230
 airplanes that give wings to the 

00:00:16.170 --> 00:00:25.649
 imagination 

00:00:18.230 --> 00:00:25.649
 [Music] 

00:00:28.689 --> 00:00:34.430
 they have a room the size of the airplanes 

00:00:31.939 --> 00:00:36.950
 and the drivers are pilots. 

00:00:34.430 --> 00:00:39.579
 but also on the basis of radio control 

00:00:36.950 --> 00:00:39.579
 frequency 

00:00:39.630 --> 00:00:44.830
 despite the difference in size 

00:00:42.400 --> 00:00:46.870
 aeromodelismo bears similarities to 

00:00:44.830 --> 00:00:50.260
 when I went to do a new test 

00:00:46.870 --> 00:00:51.970
 in this will the dream of showing whether it will be 

00:00:50.260 --> 00:00:55.600
 that I will be able to be a pilot will be that 

00:00:51.970 --> 00:00:57.160
 I take way to something I already know the 

00:00:55.600 --> 00:00:59.140
 aeromodelling I had a lot 

00:00:57.160 --> 00:01:00.490
 sensitivity so I took the plane 

00:00:59.140 --> 00:01:01.270
 I really did go first 

00:01:00.490 --> 00:01:03.850
 classrooms 

00:01:01.270 --> 00:01:06.010
 Eduard also pilots aircraft and used 

00:01:03.850 --> 00:01:07.930
 the model aircraft to study maneuvers 

00:01:06.010 --> 00:01:08.830
 started with a study today moves high 

00:01:07.930 --> 00:01:10.690
 very seriously 

00:01:08.830 --> 00:01:12.760
 they measure up to two meters 

00:01:10.690 --> 00:01:15.130
 length can be moved with gasoline 

00:01:12.760 --> 00:01:17.590
 special fuel or even the battery 

00:01:15.130 --> 00:01:20.110
 in the air some models pass easily 

00:01:17.590 --> 00:01:22.690
 100 kilometers per hour and can 

00:01:20.110 --> 00:01:25.000
 reach 3 thousand meters high and 10 

00:01:22.690 --> 00:01:27.400
 models weigh up to 10 pounds 

00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:29.440
 this one is lighter less than 2 

00:01:27.400 --> 00:01:31.690
 pounds and is made from a swallow waves 

00:01:29.440 --> 00:01:33.790
 the same material as that 

00:01:31.690 --> 00:01:36.490
 office is made for beginners 

00:01:33.790 --> 00:01:38.259
 because the wings are on the top 

00:01:36.490 --> 00:01:39.490
 even so it can reach 80 

00:01:38.259 --> 00:01:42.070
 kilometers per hour 

00:01:39.490 --> 00:01:43.720
 there are still those made of fiber 

00:01:42.070 --> 00:01:45.670
 glass and wood 

00:01:43.720 --> 00:01:48.580
 every self-respecting pilot also takes a 

00:01:45.670 --> 00:01:50.259
 mobile workshop the so-called field box is 

00:01:48.580 --> 00:01:52.570
 tool to work with the airplane if 

00:01:50.259 --> 00:01:55.360
 can you have an unforeseen good time? 

00:01:52.570 --> 00:01:57.429
 your plane has to have a box of 

00:01:55.360 --> 00:01:59.410
 exchange itesp week passes test in a 

00:01:57.429 --> 00:02:01.330
 if you can get a fixed job on the plane 

00:01:59.410 --> 00:02:03.819
 all the necessary tool and who 

00:02:01.330 --> 00:02:07.750
 pilot does not leave the ground also travels the 

00:02:03.819 --> 00:02:11.280
 forget everything and you are here only in 

00:02:07.750 --> 00:02:11.280
 it was not the model is very cool 

00:02:12.570 --> 00:02:17.220
 [Music] 

00:02:20.270 --> 00:02:23.469
 [Music] 

00:02:27.600 --> 00:02:34.539
 [Music] 

00:02:38.910 --> 00:02:43.820
 it's really cool
