00:00:00.439 --> 00:00:03.000
 this is the small town waned in Folkerts 

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:06.430
 we want to know how the milk gets into the bag 

00:00:06.430 --> 00:00:08.499
 So let's start with the cows 

00:00:08.499 --> 00:00:10.149
 the Latvians milked 

00:00:10.149 --> 00:00:12.739
 that's a farmer's wife in the mirror 

00:00:12.739 --> 00:00:16.189
 and how is it going with the milking now 

00:00:16.189 --> 00:00:19.300
 First, the Reuters will be done too 

00:00:19.300 --> 00:00:22.970
 and the cows are not milked by hand as in the past but with 

00:00:22.970 --> 00:00:25.970
 a machine 

00:00:26.880 --> 00:00:31.269
 First turn on and then comes a Belgian officer test 

00:00:31.269 --> 00:00:34.269
 and that also looked like data from under the milk 

00:00:37.240 --> 00:00:40.240
 The Mace then closed through this hose 

00:00:42.090 --> 00:00:45.240
 through this sight glass and then browses a metal tube 

00:00:46.960 --> 00:00:49.430
 and so ends up in such a day 

00:00:49.430 --> 00:00:52.449
 Every morning the car comes from the dairy 

00:00:52.449 --> 00:00:54.540
 the driver connects a hose 

00:00:54.540 --> 00:00:57.540
 and prompt the milk in the tank of Samba 

00:01:00.100 --> 00:01:03.100
 the cows get milk after they are found in the stable 

00:01:04.550 --> 00:01:08.210
 when the driver was picked up in the arcade continued to lead me to 

00:01:08.210 --> 00:01:09.400
 next farmers 

00:01:09.400 --> 00:01:12.430
 and when his tour is over then he drives to Plauen 

00:01:12.430 --> 00:01:15.430
 CEO dairy previously plans Milch GmbH 

00:01:19.820 --> 00:01:23.090
 when he arrives he stops driving the tanks 

00:01:23.090 --> 00:01:25.690
 then look again and the fresh milk 

00:01:25.690 --> 00:01:28.800
 British pumped the large storage tanks of the dairy 

00:01:30.360 --> 00:01:32.210
 that's what they look like 

00:01:32.210 --> 00:01:36.240
 she gets heated up so that the Metelene keeps her in this 

00:01:36.240 --> 00:01:38.020
 Plant with many ears 

00:01:38.020 --> 00:01:40.230
 in the pipes fries the milk 

00:01:40.230 --> 00:01:43.880
 and if you take off this connector one then sees that 

00:01:43.880 --> 00:01:46.600
 Pipes are all interconnected 

00:01:46.600 --> 00:01:50.960
 in the thick pipes is hot water and the milk runs through these thin ones 

00:01:50.960 --> 00:01:54.290
 Lines by it is heated and preserved 

00:01:54.290 --> 00:01:57.150
 we have the milk now we need the bag 

00:01:57.150 --> 00:01:58.840
 Let's go with such a cardboard 

00:01:58.840 --> 00:02:02.640
 At first, the poplars are marked on the places that mark it 

00:02:02.640 --> 00:02:04.240
 folded later 

00:02:04.240 --> 00:02:07.240
 and most importantly the hole for the straw is punched out 

00:02:08.229 --> 00:02:12.719
 then the cardboard is printed with the CEO clever logo of Tetra Pak and on the 

00:02:12.719 --> 00:02:15.519
 Outside comes no plastic coating 

00:02:15.519 --> 00:02:18.530
 because he could not show it, we just do it with normal 

00:02:18.529 --> 00:02:20.199
 Cling film 

00:02:20.199 --> 00:02:24.219
 then it goes on the inside further as there is also a coating on it 

00:02:24.219 --> 00:02:27.249
 and then a layer on to him Jung foil 

00:02:28.889 --> 00:02:32.529
 Prohn so that the milk does not come in contact with the metal again 

00:02:32.529 --> 00:02:35.529
 plastic 

00:02:37.149 --> 00:02:40.549
 In fact, the bag looks better than our model, of course 

00:02:40.549 --> 00:02:41.609
 is clear 

00:02:41.609 --> 00:02:45.089
 and that only for the straw is closed by the different layers 

00:02:45.089 --> 00:02:47.689
 otherwise the milk would be leaking year 

00:02:47.689 --> 00:02:51.389
 If you put the original bag on the edge on gag then you can see the individual 

00:02:51.389 --> 00:02:55.629
 Layers seven samples the stage plastic film then the cardboard and 

00:02:55.629 --> 00:02:59.609
 including the aluminum the two inner plastic layers around the 

00:02:59.609 --> 00:03:03.839
 But aluminum is so thin you can not separate it all over 

00:03:03.839 --> 00:03:06.349
 Packaging is on a huge wool 

00:03:06.349 --> 00:03:09.579
 and how are the individual milk cartons made of them? 

00:03:09.579 --> 00:03:13.069
 You can not actually see what is happening now but we have for the movie 

00:03:13.069 --> 00:03:14.559
 the machine opened 

00:03:14.559 --> 00:03:16.130
 the role is handled 

00:03:16.130 --> 00:03:20.230
 and then comes from this white scooter a thin strip of plastic that will 

00:03:20.230 --> 00:03:23.600
 made hot and glued to the edge of the packaging 

00:03:23.600 --> 00:03:25.989
 survives a bit 

00:03:25.989 --> 00:03:29.480
 to see how it goes on you have to stop the machine now 

00:03:30.169 --> 00:03:31.939
 open the door 

00:03:31.939 --> 00:03:34.939
 and get the train out 

00:03:35.949 --> 00:03:38.949
 the show shows exciting things happening behind it 

00:03:43.229 --> 00:03:44.559
 there will be the train 

00:03:44.559 --> 00:03:48.019
 booked now 

00:03:48.019 --> 00:03:51.530
 This machine turns the flat web into a hose 

00:03:51.530 --> 00:03:54.530
 the experts also say a tour bus 

00:03:55.569 --> 00:03:58.029
 Here you can see how it starts 

00:03:58.029 --> 00:04:00.809
 And then something very important is added 

00:04:00.809 --> 00:04:05.049
 namely this tube that goes here in the tube and through this tube 

00:04:05.049 --> 00:04:06.789
 the milk is running 

00:04:06.789 --> 00:04:09.599
 and at this point the hose is tightly closed 

00:04:09.599 --> 00:04:12.339
 that makes this metal parts with the holes in it 

00:04:12.339 --> 00:04:15.829
 the swing in Dinart Rheine and out of the holes "is called in the air 

00:04:16.959 --> 00:04:18.500
 you have to imagine it that way 

00:04:18.500 --> 00:04:22.540
 what's left of the thin plastic strip still really survives 

00:04:22.540 --> 00:04:25.479
 Art hair dryer made hot 

00:04:25.479 --> 00:04:26.440
 so long 

00:04:26.440 --> 00:04:28.840
 until this stripe becomes soft and sticky 

00:04:28.840 --> 00:04:32.870
 and then if the packaging regulation of the machine is firmly compressed 

00:04:32.870 --> 00:04:35.870
 glued soft plastic the edges 

00:04:38.199 --> 00:04:41.169
 then do it 

00:04:41.169 --> 00:04:45.330
 and then the finished tube or tube runs in the lower part of the 

00:04:45.330 --> 00:04:46.460
 machine 

00:04:46.460 --> 00:04:49.430
 but how is the milk in the pack now? 

00:04:49.430 --> 00:04:53.139
 even if you open the machine you can not see much only the hose 

00:04:53.139 --> 00:04:54.759
 and so funny tangible 

00:04:54.759 --> 00:04:58.309
 we have to stop the machine again and take the packaging away 

00:04:58.309 --> 00:05:01.020
 as if the hose comes down from above 

00:05:01.020 --> 00:05:04.100
 but now you can see the pipe in particular because the milk is running 

00:05:05.059 --> 00:05:08.059
 the milk and the packaging do not run in any country 

00:05:09.159 --> 00:05:13.059
 down there the milk comes out of the tube and gets into the packaging 

00:05:13.059 --> 00:05:14.419
 Hose upwards 

00:05:14.419 --> 00:05:17.249
 and so that the girls the hose does not rise so high is there 

00:05:17.249 --> 00:05:20.689
 Swimmer regulates the intake of milk 

00:05:20.689 --> 00:05:24.379
 So now the girl is the tube but how is he now a single 

00:05:24.379 --> 00:05:28.929
 Milk bag on top of it, there are these grippers what do they do in the 

00:05:28.929 --> 00:05:32.309
 Slow motion can not be recognized correctly 

00:05:32.309 --> 00:05:36.239
 the claw takes the tube price together and welds together 

00:05:36.239 --> 00:05:39.639
 exactly in the middle of the weld, the hose is cut 

00:05:39.639 --> 00:05:43.210
 then comes the next ladder doing the exact same thing in the next place 

00:05:43.210 --> 00:05:45.860
 tightly compress welding german alps 

00:05:45.860 --> 00:05:49.639
 so that the milk carton is dense top and bottom and falls into the next 

00:05:49.639 --> 00:05:50.699
 Department 

00:05:50.699 --> 00:05:53.699
 then the corners are turned over 

00:05:55.059 --> 00:05:57.930
 the jump failed 

00:05:57.930 --> 00:06:01.369
 then plastic will make us believe business is sticking 

00:06:01.369 --> 00:06:05.009
 and then the corners fixed price and of course not on one side 

00:06:05.009 --> 00:06:06.879
 but also on the other 

00:06:06.879 --> 00:06:09.680
 then the milk is in the pack 

00:06:09.680 --> 00:06:12.860
 but one little thing is missing 

00:06:12.860 --> 00:06:16.279
 but you can now see the slow motion 

00:06:16.279 --> 00:06:18.979
 there is glue sprayed on the bag 

00:06:18.979 --> 00:06:21.659
 and so he is pasted Stroheim outside 

00:06:21.659 --> 00:06:24.659
 there you can see 

00:06:26.539 --> 00:06:29.909
 and now our top clever milk carton is really done 

00:06:30.819 --> 00:06:33.509
 so she comes to the schools 

00:06:33.509 --> 00:06:35.409
 and he is drunk 

00:06:35.409 --> 00:06:39.709
 The Geo clever school milk program is available nationwide at about 3000 schools 

00:06:40.400 --> 00:06:44.320
 this also includes special tons for the used types 

00:06:44.320 --> 00:06:48.090
 you can do something neat in the yellow bag they can collected 

00:06:48.090 --> 00:06:50.770
 processed and recycled 

00:06:50.770 --> 00:06:52.520
 but this is another story
