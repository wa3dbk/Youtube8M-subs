today we take a quick look at the

00:00:27.220 --> 00:00:29.220 
today we take a quick look at the
quality<00:00:27.640> of<00:00:27.730> Steel<00:00:28.000> shots<00:00:28.390> from<00:00:28.810> the<00:00:29.019> onboard

00:00:29.220 --> 00:00:29.230

out<00:00:31.779> of<00:00:31.810> the<00:00:31.960> box<00:00:32.140> we<00:00:32.769> also<00:00:32.890> take<00:00:33.160> a<00:00:33.220> look<00:00:33.430> at

00:00:33.479 --> 00:00:33.489 
out of the box we also take a look at

00:00:33.489 --> 00:00:34.860 
out of the box we also take a look at
the<00:00:33.610> video<00:00:33.850> side<00:00:34.180> of<00:00:34.300> things<00:00:34.510> in<00:00:34.660> a<00:00:34.720> different

00:00:34.860 --> 00:00:34.870 
the video side of things in a different

00:00:34.870 --> 00:00:36.630 
the video side of things in a different
segment<00:00:35.500> but<00:00:35.650> still<00:00:35.920> shots<00:00:36.190> are<00:00:36.340> obviously

00:00:36.630 --> 00:00:36.640 
segment but still shots are obviously

00:00:36.640 --> 00:00:38.850 
segment but still shots are obviously
the<00:00:36.730> basis<00:00:37.120> for<00:00:37.269> video<00:00:37.540> anyway<00:00:38.050> this<00:00:38.410> video<00:00:38.680> is

00:00:38.850 --> 00:00:38.860 
the basis for video anyway this video is

00:00:38.860 --> 00:00:40.229 
the basis for video anyway this video is
just<00:00:38.949> a<00:00:39.160> series<00:00:39.460> of<00:00:39.489> steel<00:00:39.760> strung<00:00:40.089> together

00:00:40.229 --> 00:00:40.239 
just a series of steel strung together

00:00:40.239 --> 00:00:42.450 
just a series of steel strung together
and<00:00:40.690> yes<00:00:41.199> I<00:00:41.440> know<00:00:41.500> most<00:00:41.800> of<00:00:41.950> you<00:00:42.040> know<00:00:42.190> that<00:00:42.430> but

00:00:42.450 --> 00:00:42.460 
and yes I know most of you know that but

00:00:42.460 --> 00:00:44.819 
and yes I know most of you know that but
maybe<00:00:43.000> some<00:00:43.300> people<00:00:43.450> don't<00:00:43.899> my<00:00:44.469> new<00:00:44.590> assistant

00:00:44.819 --> 00:00:44.829 
maybe some people don't my new assistant

00:00:44.829 --> 00:00:46.380 
maybe some people don't my new assistant
Katie<00:00:45.219> also<00:00:45.460> wanted<00:00:45.879> me<00:00:45.940> in<00:00:46.000> the<00:00:46.090> video<00:00:46.210> today

00:00:46.380 --> 00:00:46.390 
Katie also wanted me in the video today

00:00:46.390 --> 00:00:48.420 
Katie also wanted me in the video today
but<00:00:46.660> I<00:00:46.870> didn't<00:00:47.440> really<00:00:47.590> know<00:00:47.800> how<00:00:47.950> to<00:00:48.010> use<00:00:48.250> her

00:00:48.420 --> 00:00:48.430 
but I didn't really know how to use her

00:00:48.430 --> 00:00:50.250 
but I didn't really know how to use her
so<00:00:49.000> she<00:00:49.149> can<00:00:49.390> just<00:00:49.420> pretend<00:00:49.840> to<00:00:49.930> be<00:00:50.020> of<00:00:50.110> some

00:00:50.250 --> 00:00:50.260 
so she can just pretend to be of some

00:00:50.260 --> 00:00:52.529 
so she can just pretend to be of some
use<00:00:50.289> okay<00:00:51.219> so<00:00:51.280> let's<00:00:51.550> get<00:00:51.640> straight<00:00:51.879> into<00:00:52.149> it

00:00:52.529 --> 00:00:52.539 
use okay so let's get straight into it

00:00:52.539 --> 00:00:55.229 
use okay so let's get straight into it

chipset<00:01:32.619> on<00:01:32.709> the<00:01:32.800> camera<00:01:33.160> so<00:01:33.610> just<00:01:33.819> bear<00:01:33.970> this

00:01:34.080 --> 00:01:34.090 
chipset on the camera so just bear this

00:01:34.090 --> 00:01:35.730 
chipset on the camera so just bear this
in<00:01:34.270> mind<00:01:34.300> if<00:01:34.569> using<00:01:34.810> the<00:01:34.899> camera<00:01:35.200> in<00:01:35.289> low-light

00:01:35.730 --> 00:01:35.740 
in mind if using the camera in low-light

00:01:35.740 --> 00:01:37.859 
in mind if using the camera in low-light
or<00:01:36.009> around<00:01:36.250> more<00:01:36.490> pixel<00:01:36.910> intensive<00:01:37.479> imaging

00:01:37.859 --> 00:01:37.869 
or around more pixel intensive imaging

00:01:37.869 --> 00:01:39.749 
or around more pixel intensive imaging
like<00:01:38.110> trees<00:01:38.470> or<00:01:38.679> forests<00:01:39.099> with<00:01:39.459> lots<00:01:39.670> of

back on the desktop the shots look

00:01:45.369 --> 00:01:47.790 
back on the desktop the shots look
amazing<00:01:46.030> pretty<00:01:46.360> impressive<00:01:46.869> indeed<00:01:47.229> the

00:01:47.790 --> 00:01:47.800 
amazing pretty impressive indeed the

amazing pretty impressive indeed the
detail<00:01:48.190> is<00:01:48.340> quite<00:01:48.489> good<00:01:48.789> the<00:01:49.000> exposures<00:01:49.509> are

00:01:49.650 --> 00:01:49.660 
detail is quite good the exposures are

00:01:49.660 --> 00:01:51.809 
detail is quite good the exposures are
fairly<00:01:49.840> even<00:01:50.289> the<00:01:50.500> focus<00:01:50.890> is<00:01:51.009> reasonable<00:01:51.610> all

00:01:51.809 --> 00:01:51.819 
fairly even the focus is reasonable all

00:01:51.819 --> 00:01:53.249 
fairly even the focus is reasonable all
things<00:01:52.090> considered<00:01:52.479> and<00:01:52.690> the<00:01:52.840> white<00:01:52.989> balance

things considered and the white balance
or<00:01:53.530> color<00:01:53.770> overall<00:01:54.369> is<00:01:54.610> okay<00:01:54.940> as<00:01:55.060> well

00:01:55.260 --> 00:01:55.270 
or color overall is okay as well

00:01:55.270 --> 00:01:57.419
