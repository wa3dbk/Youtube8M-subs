00:00:08.970 --> 00:00:08.980 
hey guys this is a new tutorial on a

00:00:08.980 --> 00:00:12.509 
hey guys this is a new tutorial on a
trick<00:00:09.490> called<00:00:10.120> the<00:00:10.299> French<00:00:11.110> trick<00:00:11.469> the<00:00:12.280> French

00:00:12.509 --> 00:00:12.519 
trick called the French trick the French

00:00:12.519 --> 00:00:15.089 
trick called the French trick the French
trick<00:00:12.759> is<00:00:12.879> a<00:00:12.910> caboose<00:00:13.269> variation<00:00:13.900> and<00:00:14.110> it

00:00:15.089 --> 00:00:15.099 
trick is a caboose variation and it

00:00:15.099 --> 00:00:21.359 
trick is a caboose variation and it
looks<00:00:15.339> like<00:00:15.429> this<00:00:19.860> okay<00:00:20.860> so<00:00:20.919> that's<00:00:21.220> the

00:00:21.359 --> 00:00:21.369 
looks like this okay so that's the

00:00:21.369 --> 00:00:23.609 
looks like this okay so that's the
French<00:00:21.610> trick<00:00:21.880> it's<00:00:22.750> as<00:00:23.079> I<00:00:23.169> say<00:00:23.320> a<00:00:23.349> caboose

00:00:23.609 --> 00:00:23.619 
French trick it's as I say a caboose

00:00:23.619 --> 00:00:25.409 
French trick it's as I say a caboose
variation<00:00:24.130> so<00:00:24.340> the<00:00:24.520> precursor<00:00:24.880> to<00:00:25.029> this<00:00:25.119> trick

00:00:25.409 --> 00:00:25.419 
variation so the precursor to this trick

00:00:25.419 --> 00:00:29.940 
variation so the precursor to this trick
or<00:00:25.779> I<00:00:25.840> could<00:00:26.320> boots<00:00:26.529> across<00:00:26.849> and<00:00:28.919> probably<00:00:29.919> a

00:00:29.940 --> 00:00:29.950 
or I could boots across and probably a

00:00:29.950 --> 00:00:33.240 
or I could boots across and probably a
triple<00:00:30.340> undo<00:00:30.579> I<00:00:30.700> would<00:00:30.880> say<00:00:31.059> and<00:00:32.250> you're

00:00:33.240 --> 00:00:33.250 
triple undo I would say and you're

00:00:33.250 --> 00:00:34.590 
triple undo I would say and you're
probably<00:00:33.399> also<00:00:33.640> the<00:00:33.820> caboose<00:00:34.090> from<00:00:34.180> those<00:00:34.420> two

00:00:34.590 --> 00:00:34.600 
probably also the caboose from those two

00:00:34.600 --> 00:00:36.420 
probably also the caboose from those two
tricks<00:00:34.840> I'm<00:00:35.620> sorry<00:00:35.770> the<00:00:35.890> feint<00:00:36.100> stroke<00:00:36.340> from

00:00:36.420 --> 00:00:36.430 
tricks I'm sorry the feint stroke from

00:00:36.430 --> 00:00:39.420 
tricks I'm sorry the feint stroke from
those<00:00:36.610> two<00:00:36.790> tricks<00:00:36.970> alone<00:00:37.530> so<00:00:38.530> what<00:00:39.190> is<00:00:39.340> the

00:00:39.420 --> 00:00:39.430 
those two tricks alone so what is the

00:00:39.430 --> 00:00:42.540 
those two tricks alone so what is the
trick<00:00:39.640> firstly<00:00:40.120> the<00:00:40.720> trick<00:00:40.960> is<00:00:41.200> a<00:00:41.550> normal

00:00:42.540 --> 00:00:42.550 
trick firstly the trick is a normal

00:00:42.550 --> 00:00:47.670 
trick firstly the trick is a normal
caboose<00:00:43.380> except<00:00:44.670> from<00:00:45.670> here<00:00:46.470> you're<00:00:47.470> going<00:00:47.620> to

00:00:47.670 --> 00:00:47.680 
caboose except from here you're going to

00:00:47.680 --> 00:00:50.940 
caboose except from here you're going to
do<00:00:47.860> this<00:00:48.610> jump<00:00:49.000> this<00:00:49.480> swing<00:00:49.840> and<00:00:50.290> that<00:00:50.620> jump

00:00:50.940 --> 00:00:50.950 
do this jump this swing and that jump

00:00:50.950 --> 00:00:56.040 
do this jump this swing and that jump
all<00:00:51.460> in<00:00:51.850> one<00:00:52.030> jump<00:00:52.329> so<00:00:52.630> it's<00:00:52.810> down<00:00:53.739> here<00:00:55.050> one

00:00:56.040 --> 00:00:56.050 
all in one jump so it's down here one

00:00:56.050 --> 00:00:58.650 
all in one jump so it's down here one
two<00:00:56.620> three<00:00:57.220> all<00:00:57.760> in<00:00:58.120> one<00:00:58.239> jump<00:00:58.450> and<00:00:58.600> that's

00:00:58.650 --> 00:00:58.660 
two three all in one jump and that's

00:00:58.660 --> 00:01:00.479 
two three all in one jump and that's
what<00:00:58.810> the<00:00:58.870> French<00:00:59.050> Cross<00:00:59.410> French<00:00:59.890> trick<00:01:00.160> is<00:01:00.310> I

00:01:00.479 --> 00:01:00.489 
what the French Cross French trick is I

00:01:00.489 --> 00:01:01.800 
what the French Cross French trick is I
hope<00:01:00.880> you<00:01:01.000> can<00:01:01.120> see<00:01:01.210> that<00:01:01.390> in<00:01:01.450> the<00:01:01.570> east<00:01:01.690> low

00:01:01.800 --> 00:01:01.810 
hope you can see that in the east low

00:01:01.810 --> 00:01:05.399 
hope you can see that in the east low
motion<00:01:02.220> okay<00:01:03.220> so<00:01:03.280> to<00:01:03.489> do<00:01:03.640> this<00:01:03.790> trick<00:01:04.119> it's<00:01:05.049> not

00:01:05.399 --> 00:01:05.409 
motion okay so to do this trick it's not

00:01:05.409 --> 00:01:07.139 
motion okay so to do this trick it's not
actually<00:01:05.710> too<00:01:05.920> difficult<00:01:06.369> to<00:01:06.460> learn<00:01:06.490> if<00:01:06.909> you

00:01:07.139 --> 00:01:07.149 
actually too difficult to learn if you

00:01:07.149 --> 00:01:09.510 
actually too difficult to learn if you
have<00:01:07.840> a<00:01:07.899> technique<00:01:08.320> and<00:01:08.649> here's<00:01:09.369> what<00:01:09.490> I

00:01:09.510 --> 00:01:09.520 
have a technique and here's what I

00:01:09.520 --> 00:01:11.609 
have a technique and here's what I
suggest<00:01:09.999> you<00:01:10.090> do<00:01:10.299> dance<00:01:11.049> your<00:01:11.319> caboose

00:01:11.609 --> 00:01:11.619 
suggest you do dance your caboose

00:01:11.619 --> 00:01:14.370 
suggest you do dance your caboose
position<00:01:12.009> here<00:01:12.479> now<00:01:13.479> always<00:01:13.719> do<00:01:13.990> here<00:01:14.229> is

00:01:14.370 --> 00:01:14.380 
position here now always do here is

00:01:14.380 --> 00:01:16.230 
position here now always do here is
basically<00:01:14.530> just<00:01:14.979> stop<00:01:15.159> the<00:01:15.280> rope<00:01:15.460> right<00:01:15.850> under

00:01:16.230 --> 00:01:16.240 
basically just stop the rope right under

00:01:16.240 --> 00:01:18.090 
basically just stop the rope right under
your<00:01:16.329> toes<00:01:16.600> here<00:01:17.020> because<00:01:17.649> this<00:01:17.770> way<00:01:17.950> the

00:01:18.090 --> 00:01:18.100 
your toes here because this way the

00:01:18.100 --> 00:01:19.309 
your toes here because this way the
tricks<00:01:18.310> actually<00:01:18.579> could<00:01:18.700> be<00:01:18.729> really<00:01:19.119> easy

00:01:19.309 --> 00:01:19.319 
tricks actually could be really easy

00:01:19.319 --> 00:01:21.239 
tricks actually could be really easy
we're<00:01:20.319> gonna<00:01:20.530> do<00:01:20.679> here<00:01:20.920> is<00:01:20.950> you're<00:01:21.100> going<00:01:21.130> to

00:01:21.239 --> 00:01:21.249 
we're gonna do here is you're going to

00:01:21.249 --> 00:01:23.309 
we're gonna do here is you're going to
do<00:01:21.340> a<00:01:21.369> big<00:01:21.639> jump<00:01:21.939> and<00:01:22.270> then<00:01:22.990> you're<00:01:23.170> going<00:01:23.259> to

00:01:23.309 --> 00:01:23.319 
do a big jump and then you're going to

00:01:23.319 --> 00:01:26.340 
do a big jump and then you're going to
swing<00:01:23.649> the<00:01:23.829> rope<00:01:23.979> up<00:01:24.819> and<00:01:25.209> back<00:01:25.719> behind<00:01:25.749> you

00:01:26.340 --> 00:01:26.350 
swing the rope up and back behind you

00:01:26.350 --> 00:01:28.260 
swing the rope up and back behind you
make<00:01:26.859> sure<00:01:27.039> you<00:01:27.159> swing<00:01:27.399> the<00:01:27.490> rope<00:01:27.579> after<00:01:28.209> you

00:01:28.260 --> 00:01:28.270 
make sure you swing the rope after you

00:01:28.270 --> 00:01:29.849 
make sure you swing the rope after you
started<00:01:28.630> the<00:01:28.749> jump<00:01:28.959> because<00:01:29.289> if<00:01:29.530> you<00:01:29.590> move<00:01:29.740> at

00:01:29.849 --> 00:01:29.859 
started the jump because if you move at

00:01:29.859 --> 00:01:32.039 
started the jump because if you move at
the<00:01:29.950> same<00:01:30.130> time<00:01:30.399> it's<00:01:31.359> going<00:01:31.479> get<00:01:31.630> tangled

00:01:32.039 --> 00:01:32.049 
the same time it's going get tangled

00:01:32.049 --> 00:01:34.760 
the same time it's going get tangled
like<00:01:32.139> that<00:01:32.319> so<00:01:32.439> you've<00:01:32.530> got<00:01:32.619> to<00:01:32.709> jump<00:01:32.920> first

00:01:34.760 --> 00:01:34.770 
like that so you've got to jump first

00:01:34.770 --> 00:01:38.669 
like that so you've got to jump first
here<00:01:35.770> under<00:01:36.130> your<00:01:36.219> toes<00:01:36.490> jump<00:01:37.149> swing<00:01:37.689> and<00:01:38.020> then

00:01:38.669 --> 00:01:38.679 
here under your toes jump swing and then

00:01:38.679 --> 00:01:40.830 
here under your toes jump swing and then
basically<00:01:39.100> it's<00:01:39.340> it's<00:01:39.880> no<00:01:40.270> harder<00:01:40.539> than<00:01:40.779> the

00:01:40.830 --> 00:01:40.840 
basically it's it's no harder than the

00:01:40.840 --> 00:01:42.120 
basically it's it's no harder than the
backwards<00:01:41.200> double<00:01:41.409> under<00:01:41.619> if<00:01:41.709> you<00:01:41.770> do<00:01:41.889> it<00:01:42.009> that

00:01:42.120 --> 00:01:42.130 
backwards double under if you do it that

00:01:42.130 --> 00:01:42.569 
backwards double under if you do it that
way

00:01:42.569 --> 00:01:42.579 
way

00:01:42.579 --> 00:01:44.760 
way
the<00:01:43.209> hard<00:01:43.479> way<00:01:43.719> to<00:01:43.779> do<00:01:43.990> it<00:01:44.139> is<00:01:44.259> obviously<00:01:44.590> as<00:01:44.679> I

00:01:44.760 --> 00:01:44.770 
the hard way to do it is obviously as I

00:01:44.770 --> 00:01:46.830 
the hard way to do it is obviously as I
did<00:01:44.950> this<00:01:45.069> star<00:01:45.399> with<00:01:45.639> which<00:01:46.450> is<00:01:46.569> actually

00:01:46.830 --> 00:01:46.840 
did this star with which is actually

00:01:46.840 --> 00:01:48.209 
did this star with which is actually
just<00:01:46.899> you<00:01:47.139> know<00:01:47.229> going<00:01:47.409> straight<00:01:47.770> into<00:01:47.979> it

00:01:48.209 --> 00:01:48.219 
just you know going straight into it

00:01:48.219 --> 00:01:51.149 
just you know going straight into it
from<00:01:48.909> from<00:01:49.779> the<00:01:49.899> off<00:01:50.020> so<00:01:50.709> to<00:01:50.829> do<00:01:50.950> that<00:01:50.979> I

00:01:51.149 --> 00:01:51.159 
from from the off so to do that I

00:01:51.159 --> 00:01:52.379 
from from the off so to do that I
suggest<00:01:51.429> you<00:01:51.700> try<00:01:51.969> and<00:01:52.090> make<00:01:52.179> little

00:01:52.379 --> 00:01:52.389 
suggest you try and make little

00:01:52.389 --> 00:01:54.539 
suggest you try and make little
progressions<00:01:53.079> so<00:01:53.229> you<00:01:53.709> know<00:01:53.920> start<00:01:54.249> moving<00:01:54.459> it

00:01:54.539 --> 00:01:54.549 
progressions so you know start moving it

00:01:54.549 --> 00:01:55.980 
progressions so you know start moving it
away<00:01:54.639> from<00:01:54.819> your<00:01:54.969> toes<00:01:55.149> to<00:01:55.329> start<00:01:55.599> with<00:01:55.749> it<00:01:55.869> may

00:01:55.980 --> 00:01:55.990 
away from your toes to start with it may

00:01:55.990 --> 00:01:59.279 
away from your toes to start with it may
be<00:01:56.049> on<00:01:56.529> your<00:01:56.859> toes<00:01:56.979> here<00:01:57.340> then<00:01:58.209> try<00:01:58.479> out<00:01:58.659> there

00:01:59.279 --> 00:01:59.289 
be on your toes here then try out there

00:01:59.289 --> 00:02:02.969 
be on your toes here then try out there
then<00:02:00.249> a<00:02:00.520> bit<00:02:00.789> further<00:02:01.060> as<00:02:01.240> you<00:02:01.359> can<00:02:01.630> and<00:02:01.979> then

00:02:02.969 --> 00:02:02.979 
then a bit further as you can and then

00:02:02.979 --> 00:02:04.980 
then a bit further as you can and then
once<00:02:03.639> you've<00:02:03.819> done<00:02:03.849> that<00:02:04.029> try<00:02:04.509> and<00:02:04.749> spots

00:02:04.980 --> 00:02:04.990 
once you've done that try and spots

00:02:04.990 --> 00:02:07.199 
once you've done that try and spots
reducing<00:02:05.619> the<00:02:05.709> gap<00:02:05.889> between<00:02:06.579> the<00:02:06.849> friend<00:02:07.029> Rick

00:02:07.199 --> 00:02:07.209 
reducing the gap between the friend Rick

00:02:07.209 --> 00:02:09.570 
reducing the gap between the friend Rick
so<00:02:07.329> instead<00:02:07.539> of<00:02:07.599> going<00:02:07.779> from<00:02:07.959> here<00:02:08.580> pausing

00:02:09.570 --> 00:02:09.580 
so instead of going from here pausing

00:02:09.580 --> 00:02:12.750 
so instead of going from here pausing
and<00:02:10.390> then<00:02:10.599> doing<00:02:10.810> the<00:02:10.990> trick<00:02:11.530> instead<00:02:11.890> just

00:02:12.750 --> 00:02:12.760 
and then doing the trick instead just

00:02:12.760 --> 00:02:14.640 
and then doing the trick instead just
try<00:02:13.060> and<00:02:13.120> you<00:02:13.390> know<00:02:13.510> really<00:02:13.840> snap<00:02:14.170> it<00:02:14.319> straight

00:02:14.640 --> 00:02:14.650 
try and you know really snap it straight

00:02:14.650 --> 00:02:17.830 
try and you know really snap it straight
back<00:02:15.329> then<00:02:16.329> go<00:02:16.480> straight<00:02:16.780> into<00:02:16.989> it

00:02:17.830 --> 00:02:17.840 
back then go straight into it

00:02:17.840 --> 00:02:18.970 
back then go straight into it
and<00:02:17.900> that's<00:02:18.050> when<00:02:18.260> it<00:02:18.349> gets<00:02:18.410> actually<00:02:18.800> quite

00:02:18.970 --> 00:02:18.980 
and that's when it gets actually quite

00:02:18.980 --> 00:02:21.309 
and that's when it gets actually quite
difficult<00:02:19.420> so<00:02:20.420> as<00:02:20.540> it<00:02:20.660> says<00:02:20.780> here<00:02:20.959> you<00:02:21.170> do<00:02:21.290> the

00:02:21.309 --> 00:02:21.319 
difficult so as it says here you do the

00:02:21.319 --> 00:02:24.570 
difficult so as it says here you do the
basic<00:02:21.620> French<00:02:21.920> trick<00:02:22.220> now<00:02:22.760> some<00:02:23.599> variations

00:02:24.570 --> 00:02:24.580 
basic French trick now some variations

00:02:24.580 --> 00:02:27.009 
basic French trick now some variations
there<00:02:25.580> are<00:02:25.670> lot<00:02:25.790> variations<00:02:26.300> to<00:02:26.390> this<00:02:26.510> trick

00:02:27.009 --> 00:02:27.019 
there are lot variations to this trick

00:02:27.019 --> 00:02:29.130 
there are lot variations to this trick
the<00:02:27.980> most<00:02:28.160> obvious<00:02:28.310> i<00:02:28.580> think<00:02:28.610> is<00:02:28.879> probably

00:02:29.130 --> 00:02:29.140 
the most obvious i think is probably

00:02:29.140 --> 00:02:32.050 
the most obvious i think is probably
doing<00:02:30.140> a<00:02:30.200> French<00:02:30.410> trick<00:02:30.680> of<00:02:30.800> a<00:02:30.860> cross<00:02:31.099> which

00:02:32.050 --> 00:02:32.060 
doing a French trick of a cross which

00:02:32.060 --> 00:02:41.410 
doing a French trick of a cross which
looks<00:02:32.360> like<00:02:32.450> this<00:02:35.049> so<00:02:36.049> I<00:02:36.080> again<00:02:39.489> for<00:02:40.489> that<00:02:40.610> to

00:02:41.410 --> 00:02:41.420 
looks like this so I again for that to

00:02:41.420 --> 00:02:43.360 
looks like this so I again for that to
convey<00:02:41.720> very<00:02:41.870> cleanly<00:02:42.110> or<00:02:42.799> doing<00:02:43.160> it<00:02:43.190> with

00:02:43.360 --> 00:02:43.370 
convey very cleanly or doing it with

00:02:43.370 --> 00:02:45.670 
convey very cleanly or doing it with
double-under<00:02:43.970> which<00:02:44.209> is<00:02:44.390> like<00:02:44.569> a<00:02:44.810> quadruple

00:02:45.670 --> 00:02:45.680 
double-under which is like a quadruple

00:02:45.680 --> 00:02:52.710 
double-under which is like a quadruple
under<00:02:45.950> basically<00:02:46.610> looks<00:02:47.420> like<00:02:47.510> this<00:02:49.329> again

00:02:52.710 --> 00:02:52.720 

00:02:52.720 --> 00:02:59.410 

all<00:02:53.720> the<00:02:53.840> time<00:02:57.910> can't<00:02:58.910> do<00:02:59.000> that<00:02:59.120> one<00:02:59.269> in<00:02:59.299> the

00:02:59.410 --> 00:02:59.420 
all the time can't do that one in the

00:02:59.420 --> 00:03:01.720 
all the time can't do that one in the
moment<00:03:00.130> anyway<00:03:01.130> those<00:03:01.310> are<00:03:01.340> some<00:03:01.610> of<00:03:01.700> the

00:03:01.720 --> 00:03:01.730 
moment anyway those are some of the

00:03:01.730 --> 00:03:04.150 
moment anyway those are some of the
basic<00:03:02.090> variations<00:03:02.510> you<00:03:02.629> can<00:03:02.660> do<00:03:02.920> and<00:03:03.920> there's

00:03:04.150 --> 00:03:04.160 
basic variations you can do and there's

00:03:04.160 --> 00:03:05.970 
basic variations you can do and there's
not<00:03:04.280> really<00:03:04.430> much<00:03:04.610> I<00:03:04.790> can<00:03:04.819> add<00:03:05.120> to<00:03:05.329> those<00:03:05.480> ones

00:03:05.970 --> 00:03:05.980 
not really much I can add to those ones

00:03:05.980 --> 00:03:08.890 
not really much I can add to those ones
except<00:03:06.980> it's<00:03:07.700> all<00:03:07.879> about<00:03:08.060> really<00:03:08.390> how<00:03:08.569> fast

00:03:08.890 --> 00:03:08.900 
except it's all about really how fast

00:03:08.900 --> 00:03:10.720 
except it's all about really how fast
you<00:03:09.110> can<00:03:09.230> move<00:03:09.980> it<00:03:10.190> move<00:03:10.579> it

00:03:10.720 --> 00:03:10.730 
you can move it move it

00:03:10.730 --> 00:03:13.809 
you can move it move it
after<00:03:11.090> you've<00:03:11.209> got<00:03:11.390> a<00:03:11.420> jump<00:03:11.720> so<00:03:12.819> obviously

00:03:13.809 --> 00:03:13.819 
after you've got a jump so obviously

00:03:13.819 --> 00:03:15.039 
after you've got a jump so obviously
since<00:03:14.000> you<00:03:14.120> actually<00:03:14.450> have<00:03:14.569> to<00:03:14.690> jump<00:03:14.930> before

00:03:15.039 --> 00:03:15.049 
since you actually have to jump before

00:03:15.049 --> 00:03:17.259 
since you actually have to jump before
you've<00:03:15.379> the<00:03:15.590> Rope<00:03:15.769> the<00:03:16.670> rope<00:03:16.849> has<00:03:17.060> to<00:03:17.180> actually

00:03:17.259 --> 00:03:17.269 
you've the Rope the rope has to actually

00:03:17.269 --> 00:03:18.250 
you've the Rope the rope has to actually
be<00:03:17.420> moving<00:03:17.720> really<00:03:17.810> quickly

00:03:18.250 --> 00:03:18.260 
be moving really quickly

00:03:18.260 --> 00:03:19.059 
be moving really quickly
especially<00:03:18.709> if<00:03:18.769> you're<00:03:18.860> doing<00:03:18.890> something

00:03:19.059 --> 00:03:19.069 
especially if you're doing something

00:03:19.069 --> 00:03:22.210 
especially if you're doing something
like<00:03:19.360> French<00:03:20.360> trick<00:03:20.599> to<00:03:20.720> double<00:03:20.959> under<00:03:21.290> you

00:03:22.210 --> 00:03:22.220 
like French trick to double under you

00:03:22.220 --> 00:03:26.199 
like French trick to double under you
have<00:03:22.250> to<00:03:22.549> be<00:03:23.260> really<00:03:24.340> quick<00:03:25.400> alright<00:03:26.060> we're

00:03:26.199 --> 00:03:26.209 
have to be really quick alright we're

00:03:26.209 --> 00:03:28.599 
have to be really quick alright we're
going<00:03:26.329> back<00:03:27.069> to<00:03:28.069> do<00:03:28.220> it

00:03:28.599 --> 00:03:28.609 
going back to do it

00:03:28.609 --> 00:03:32.050 
going back to do it
I'm<00:03:29.540> variations<00:03:30.139> are<00:03:30.260> like<00:03:30.549> there's<00:03:31.549> no<00:03:31.730> I<00:03:31.760> did

00:03:32.050 --> 00:03:32.060 
I'm variations are like there's no I did

00:03:32.060 --> 00:03:36.039 
I'm variations are like there's no I did
in<00:03:32.150> 2010<00:03:33.849> which<00:03:34.849> is<00:03:34.880> a<00:03:35.030> French<00:03:35.540> trick<00:03:35.750> to<00:03:35.840> push

00:03:36.039 --> 00:03:36.049 
in 2010 which is a French trick to push

00:03:36.049 --> 00:03:39.339 
in 2010 which is a French trick to push
up<00:03:36.849> I've<00:03:37.849> lied<00:03:38.209> in<00:03:38.389> bed<00:03:38.420> today<00:03:38.690> time<00:03:39.079> I<00:03:39.109> don't

00:03:39.339 --> 00:03:39.349 
up I've lied in bed today time I don't

00:03:39.349 --> 00:03:42.009 
up I've lied in bed today time I don't
think<00:03:39.470> I<00:03:39.530> had<00:03:39.709> but<00:03:40.639> this<00:03:41.420> is<00:03:41.540> looks<00:03:41.780> like<00:03:41.900> it's

00:03:42.009 --> 00:03:42.019 
think I had but this is looks like it's

00:03:42.019 --> 00:03:47.699 
think I had but this is looks like it's
quite<00:03:42.139> cool<00:03:42.880> here<00:03:44.920> and<00:03:45.920> then<00:03:46.040> down<00:03:46.450> like<00:03:47.450> that

00:03:47.699 --> 00:03:47.709 
quite cool here and then down like that

00:03:47.709 --> 00:03:51.430 
quite cool here and then down like that
to<00:03:48.709> do<00:03:48.829> that<00:03:49.010> one<00:03:49.780> is<00:03:50.780> essentially<00:03:51.260> the<00:03:51.319> same

00:03:51.430 --> 00:03:51.440 
to do that one is essentially the same

00:03:51.440 --> 00:03:54.069 
to do that one is essentially the same
principle<00:03:52.239> except<00:03:53.239> all<00:03:53.419> you<00:03:53.540> need<00:03:53.690> to<00:03:53.780> do<00:03:53.930> is

00:03:54.069 --> 00:03:54.079 
principle except all you need to do is

00:03:54.079 --> 00:03:56.259 
principle except all you need to do is
learn<00:03:54.230> some<00:03:54.760> multiples<00:03:55.760> to<00:03:55.849> push<00:03:56.000> up<00:03:56.120> so

00:03:56.259 --> 00:03:56.269 
learn some multiples to push up so

00:03:56.269 --> 00:03:58.059 
learn some multiples to push up so
double<00:03:56.569> under<00:03:56.750> push<00:03:56.959> up<00:03:57.169> should<00:03:57.829> belong<00:03:58.010> to

00:03:58.059 --> 00:03:58.069 
double under push up should belong to

00:03:58.069 --> 00:04:00.729 
double under push up should belong to
push<00:03:58.310> up<00:03:58.489> etc<00:03:58.609> I<00:03:59.329> have<00:03:59.900> some<00:04:00.079> variations<00:04:00.560> in<00:04:00.680> my

00:04:00.729 --> 00:04:00.739 
push up etc I have some variations in my

00:04:00.739 --> 00:04:02.890 
push up etc I have some variations in my
pushup<00:04:01.069> tutorial<00:04:01.609> and<00:04:02.209> I<00:04:02.389> might<00:04:02.569> do<00:04:02.660> those<00:04:02.810> in

00:04:02.890 --> 00:04:02.900 
pushup tutorial and I might do those in

00:04:02.900 --> 00:04:04.930 
pushup tutorial and I might do those in
another<00:04:02.989> video<00:04:03.410> so<00:04:03.650> those<00:04:04.579> are<00:04:04.730> some<00:04:04.790> of<00:04:04.910> the

00:04:04.930 --> 00:04:04.940 
another video so those are some of the

00:04:04.940 --> 00:04:07.920 
another video so those are some of the
variations<00:04:05.450> you<00:04:05.540> can<00:04:05.599> do<00:04:05.859> you<00:04:06.859> can<00:04:06.980> also<00:04:07.130> do<00:04:07.310> it

00:04:07.920 --> 00:04:07.930 
variations you can do you can also do it
