00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.300
 Hello dear friends my name is 

00:00:02.190 --> 00:00:05.819
 Yuri Aksenov 

00:00:03.300 --> 00:00:08.750
 this is a gameplay rubric dedicated to reviews 

00:00:05.819 --> 00:00:09.870
 games for android put a class under the video and 

00:00:08.750 --> 00:00:11.790
 drove 

00:00:09.870 --> 00:00:13.349
 I'll start today's release with a new one 

00:00:11.790 --> 00:00:14.070
 collectible card game under 

00:00:13.349 --> 00:00:16.440
 by name 

00:00:14.070 --> 00:00:18.900
 russian shattrat elements indisputably 

00:00:16.440 --> 00:00:21.510
 hearthstone magic is the best in this 

00:00:18.900 --> 00:00:23.210
 genre but this project is also quite good 

00:00:21.510 --> 00:00:26.250
 the game has full Russian localization 

00:00:23.210 --> 00:00:28.529
 and everything was not only text but 

00:00:26.250 --> 00:00:30.330
 and voice acting and you know it is nice when 

00:00:28.529 --> 00:00:32.640
 developers make such a complete 

00:00:30.330 --> 00:00:34.980
 localize your games further let's 

00:00:32.640 --> 00:00:37.440
 deal with cards cards come in three 

00:00:34.980 --> 00:00:39.750
 the elements earth fire and water 

00:00:37.440 --> 00:00:42.510
 principle verses the following water puts out fire 

00:00:39.750 --> 00:00:44.969
 fire burns the earth and the earth absorbs 

00:00:42.510 --> 00:00:47.789
 water in the event that two collide 

00:00:44.969 --> 00:00:50.670
 identical verses are cards just 

00:00:47.789 --> 00:00:53.190
 each card will also be blocked 

00:00:50.670 --> 00:00:54.930
 risk and their unique ability and 

00:00:53.190 --> 00:00:57.570
 the principle does not work here the more 

00:00:54.930 --> 00:00:59.460
 the figure is all the better the other way around 

00:00:57.570 --> 00:01:01.890
 more profitable to use cards with more 

00:00:59.460 --> 00:01:04.320
 low risk value especially in the first 

00:01:01.890 --> 00:01:06.540
 go but the coolest abilities yet 

00:01:04.320 --> 00:01:07.740
 all cards have a risk level 

00:01:06.540 --> 00:01:09.990
 much higher 

00:01:07.740 --> 00:01:12.420
 the playing field is divided into three editors 

00:01:09.990 --> 00:01:14.820
 than the middle row doubles the risks of a case 

00:01:12.420 --> 00:01:17.070
 wins over enemy cards he gets 

00:01:14.820 --> 00:01:19.590
 damage equal to the specified risk value 

00:01:17.070 --> 00:01:21.900
 his card battle will end then when u 

00:01:19.590 --> 00:01:23.759
 you or your opponent have life points 

00:01:21.900 --> 00:01:24.570
 will be at zero card you can 

00:01:23.759 --> 00:01:26.460
 open 

00:01:24.570 --> 00:01:28.470
 and also naturally acquire for 

00:01:26.460 --> 00:01:30.420
 real money deck you can also 

00:01:28.470 --> 00:01:31.909
 manually configure besides mode 

00:01:30.420 --> 00:01:33.840
 companies are present and 

00:01:31.909 --> 00:01:36.210

00:01:33.840 --> 00:01:38.670
 fight with real players second 

00:01:36.210 --> 00:01:40.619
 the game is called fervent running and so weight in 

00:01:38.670 --> 00:01:43.049
 which you have to play for your 

00:01:40.619 --> 00:01:45.030
 soul your hero got into a car accident and 

00:01:43.049 --> 00:01:46.710
 now you have to find out what and how 

00:01:45.030 --> 00:01:48.030
 actually happened 

00:01:46.710 --> 00:01:50.369
 for this you have to allow 

00:01:48.030 --> 00:01:51.840
 many puzzles in the way 

00:01:50.369 --> 00:01:53.850
 graphically the game is made in 

00:01:51.840 --> 00:01:55.140
 low poly style and in principle 

00:01:53.850 --> 00:01:56.369
 look good 

00:01:55.140 --> 00:01:59.549
 management is carried out using 

00:01:56.369 --> 00:02:00.990
 long tapa which is terribly uncomfortable on my 

00:01:59.549 --> 00:02:02.790
 look exactly management is 

00:02:00.990 --> 00:02:04.979
 the main drawback of the game 

00:02:02.790 --> 00:02:06.960
 if you still manage to cope with 

00:02:04.979 --> 00:02:07.950

 forty five missions divided by 5 

00:04:35.810 --> 00:04:40.340
 locations, in principle, the game turned out 

00:04:37.970 --> 00:04:43.040
 not bad but it is significantly inferior 

00:04:40.340 --> 00:04:43.880
 to its predecessor in interesting and 

00:04:43.040 --> 00:04:46.880
 in graphics 

00:04:43.880 --> 00:04:48.740

 it seems that it 

00:04:50.240 --> 00:04:54.680
 really one of those good old ones 

00:04:52.190 --> 00:04:56.390
 times and does not really driven to play you 

00:04:54.680 --> 00:04:58.400

 secret places and easter eggs gameplay 

00:05:14.750 --> 00:05:18.520
 it seemed to me tedious but at the same time 

00:05:16.760 --> 00:05:20.750
 unusual in the game is also present 

00:05:18.520 --> 00:05:23.240

 into a trap in case you crash 

00:05:42.410 --> 00:05:47.020
 spikes will have to start the mission itself 

00:05:44.750 --> 00:05:49.310
 beginnings that are really very strong 

00:05:47.020 --> 00:05:50.990
 whips up like for me so arcade 

00:05:49.310 --> 00:05:52.970
 it turned out very good 

00:05:50.990 --> 00:05:55.280
 is that she is not infinite and that is her 

00:05:52.970 --> 00:05:57.530
 huge plus the main thing that developers 

00:05:55.280 --> 00:05:59.600
