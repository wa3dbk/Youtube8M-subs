00:00:05.310 --> 00:00:10.360
 well-found friends of tuttoandroid.net 

00:00:07.720 --> 00:00:12.309
 we are always in the lenovo stand but 

00:00:10.360 --> 00:00:14.410
 this is a motorola ask yourself a little 

00:00:12.309 --> 00:00:16.599
 because motorola has finally been 

00:00:14.410 --> 00:00:19.630
 the stand also integrated in lenovo 

00:00:16.599 --> 00:00:21.130
 supported 4 we go the new bike is a lot is 

00:00:19.630 --> 00:00:24.160
 that at first glance is really a lot 

00:00:21.130 --> 00:00:26.260
 very nice to a nice display a chest 

00:00:24.160 --> 00:00:27.699
 front end here on the back we have 

00:00:26.260 --> 00:00:30.029
 noticed something we didn't like 

00:00:27.699 --> 00:00:32.649
 so much and now we show it to you 

00:00:30.029 --> 00:00:35.079
 let's see if we can do it practically 

00:00:32.649 --> 00:00:37.030
 if you press a little more 

00:00:35.079 --> 00:00:39.280
 strong than normal on the display 

00:00:37.030 --> 00:00:43.389
 we see that practically the glass goes one 

00:00:39.280 --> 00:00:45.879
 po to touch against the display and this 

00:00:43.389 --> 00:00:47.949
 what is certainly not very positive 

00:00:45.879 --> 00:00:50.109
 because it indicates that the glass is not a bit 

00:00:47.949 --> 00:00:52.299
 a little flexible thing not good for 

00:00:50.109 --> 00:00:53.859
 regarding the product instead 

00:00:52.299 --> 00:00:55.659
 we have a data sheet anyway 

00:00:53.859 --> 00:00:57.999
 interesting considering the price a 

00:00:55.659 --> 00:00:59.499
 which will be sold very low shortly 

00:00:57.999 --> 00:01:01.569
 over 100 euros 

00:00:59.499 --> 00:01:04.150
 we have it in 4g lte version 

00:01:01.569 --> 00:01:07.390
 or in the simple version 3g 

00:01:04.150 --> 00:01:10.390
 we have the snapdragon 410 at 1.2 

00:01:07.390 --> 00:01:13.960
 gigahertz quad core to a 2390 battery 

00:01:10.390 --> 00:01:16.060
 milan for that should last all the 

00:01:13.960 --> 00:01:19.060
 day quietly arrives 

00:01:16.060 --> 00:01:21.310
 directly with android 5.0 lollipop 

00:01:19.060 --> 00:01:23.079
 very interesting thing 

00:01:21.310 --> 00:01:27.460
 we complete the features with a 

00:01:23.079 --> 00:01:30.960
 4.5 inch qhd display with a 

00:01:27.460 --> 00:01:33.659
 density of 245 points per inch 

00:01:30.960 --> 00:01:35.400
 I would say that in any case beyond the 

00:01:33.659 --> 00:01:37.350
 resolution that obviously is not huge 

00:01:35.400 --> 00:01:38.880
 but consider the dimensions 

00:01:37.350 --> 00:01:41.190
 I guarantee you the effect is 

00:01:38.880 --> 00:01:44.100
 we definitely do a little 

00:01:41.190 --> 00:01:46.860
 above we have the display 

00:01:44.100 --> 00:01:49.170
 the vga front camera above we have 

00:01:46.860 --> 00:01:51.899
 the jack the hole for inserting the jack 

00:01:49.170 --> 00:01:55.530
 from 3.5 mm a left side completely 

00:01:51.899 --> 00:01:57.570
 uncluttered on the lower part we have the 

00:01:55.530 --> 00:01:59.940
 micro usb input occupied by 

00:01:57.570 --> 00:02:01.470
 barbell anti-theft device 

00:01:59.940 --> 00:02:04.289
 of the volume segmentation rate 

00:02:01.470 --> 00:02:06.450
 switch off at the back of the camera in 

00:02:04.289 --> 00:02:08.280
 beautiful display with secondary microphone 

00:02:06.450 --> 00:02:11.459
 for the reduction of environmental noise is 

00:02:08.280 --> 00:02:12.660
 a little thick he must say how you can 

00:02:11.459 --> 00:02:14.510
 also unfortunately I can't see 

00:02:12.660 --> 00:02:19.019
 hold it in your hands because there is this 

00:02:14.510 --> 00:02:21.180
 giant but that's okay so you see that it is 

00:02:19.019 --> 00:02:23.340
 quite often however I would also say 

00:02:21.180 --> 00:02:25.769
 light for the software 

00:02:23.340 --> 00:02:27.410
 android lollipop practically not 

00:02:25.769 --> 00:02:29.760
 customized as per tradition 

00:02:27.410 --> 00:02:32.590
 motorola just a few additions like the 

00:02:29.760 --> 00:02:34.900
 camera that is anyway 

00:02:32.590 --> 00:02:36.400
 works well now we know it 

00:02:34.900 --> 00:02:39.860
 let's see if there's anything else 

00:02:36.400 --> 00:02:42.410
 we have the motorola gallery 

00:02:39.860 --> 00:02:44.120
 therefore the application migrates that serves 

00:02:42.410 --> 00:02:46.070
 precisely to pass from another 

00:02:44.120 --> 00:02:48.530
 device to this motorola motorcycle e 

00:02:46.070 --> 00:02:50.630
 we also have the fm radio in short the 

00:02:48.530 --> 00:02:52.220
 non-customized lollipop software 

00:02:50.630 --> 00:02:55.190
 it turns very very well you see that 

00:02:52.220 --> 00:02:57.290
 however it is always fluid therefore in 

00:02:55.190 --> 00:02:59.240
 promoted this time too 

00:02:57.290 --> 00:03:01.190
 I would say that regarding the first ones 

00:02:59.240 --> 00:03:03.230
 impressions and all unfortunately in this 

00:03:01.190 --> 00:03:05.060
 moment we can't have an idea 

00:03:03.230 --> 00:03:07.040
 complete the device but we'll do 

00:03:05.060 --> 00:03:08.180
 definitely the review because yes 

00:03:07.040 --> 00:03:10.700
 it really is about a product 

00:03:08.180 --> 00:03:13.610
 interesting to me about quality 

00:03:10.700 --> 00:03:16.280
 hurry to the price at which it is sold in 

00:03:13.610 --> 00:03:18.650
 this has been inserted in this device 

00:03:16.280 --> 00:03:20.300
 a back cover that makes it 

00:03:18.650 --> 00:03:23.180
 further often but should 

00:03:20.300 --> 00:03:26.440
 actually protecting looks a lot 

00:03:23.180 --> 00:03:26.440
 very durable
