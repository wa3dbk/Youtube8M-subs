 what should you look at 

00:01:18.440 --> 00:01:21.440
 the personal they had to do that 

00:01:25.320 --> 00:01:27.270
 had kicked the corner 

00:01:27.270 --> 00:01:28.729
 according to doctor 

00:01:28.729 --> 00:01:31.780

00:01:31.780 --> 00:01:34.780

 the goal no longer has to go 

00:01:48.590 --> 00:01:52.670
 the two players who were working this week in total are sitting there 

00:01:52.670 --> 00:01:56.040
 now so it has to adjust itself because they 

00:01:56.040 --> 00:01:59.080
 the third round opposed the workspace 

00:01:59.080 --> 00:02:00.650
 that's fun too 

00:02:00.650 --> 00:02:03.150
 I'm here 

00:02:03.150 --> 00:02:04.430

00:02:04.430 --> 00:02:08.039
 there I am up against my leg has no hold first but thanks to a market where 

00:02:08.039 --> 00:02:10.439
 do you think again in a corner where I am 

00:02:10.439 --> 00:02:13.439
 that is to see if this works well with the street view 

00:02:16.059 --> 00:02:18.439
 so 

00:02:18.439 --> 00:02:21.209
 I can, of course, just beautiful nature 

00:02:21.209 --> 00:02:22.949
 to turn 

00:02:22.949 --> 00:02:24.550
 and it all works 

00:02:24.550 --> 00:02:25.979
 where is 

00:02:25.979 --> 00:02:28.139
 he pointed hollow 

00:02:28.139 --> 00:02:30.759
 this is my street 

00:02:30.759 --> 00:02:34.119
 in four piece by piece more natural for gets very beautiful that I have one 

00:02:34.119 --> 00:02:37.579
 look around me and it really is a beautiful beautiful old display 

00:02:38.089 --> 00:02:41.329
 and also very nice that that thing say 

00:02:41.329 --> 00:02:45.039
 10 12 hours working on battery reflect, however, experienced 

00:02:46.209 --> 00:02:50.830
 the street view is an it is a pleasure the back to the press 

00:02:50.830 --> 00:02:52.140
 we just have with you 

00:02:52.140 --> 00:02:55.140
 fast it sometimes 

00:02:59.299 --> 00:03:01.949
 it is normal 

00:03:01.949 --> 00:03:04.649
 and that it was time that it was just beautiful 

00:03:04.649 --> 00:03:06.529
 that works well 

00:03:06.529 --> 00:03:11.639
 the youtube viewer we are talking about with so can also watch a movie 

00:03:11.639 --> 00:03:13.050
 that shoots of course 

00:03:13.050 --> 00:03:16.220
 about the employee wanted the super-prestige sport 

00:03:17.799 --> 00:03:19.069
 he limits 

00:03:19.069 --> 00:03:20.379
 in that 

00:03:20.379 --> 00:03:23.379
 the young man became a much better source 

00:03:23.939 --> 00:03:28.709
 the screen of the five the iphone just quite hassle the 4 

00:03:35.109 --> 00:03:39.140
 a movie from the end of this year comes out on the reviews seems like a nice one 

00:03:39.139 --> 00:03:41.819
 summer the tractors by or another 

00:03:41.819 --> 00:03:42.840
 you can be difficult 

00:03:42.840 --> 00:03:44.809
 took second place 

00:03:44.809 --> 00:03:47.629
 from x 

00:03:47.629 --> 00:03:49.929
 after the film time and time again 

00:03:49.929 --> 00:03:53.279
 infections that man is very satisfied with his show of the movie actually 

00:03:53.279 --> 00:03:55.289
 no more since papua 

00:03:55.289 --> 00:03:59.889
 but actually with nothing else that they say people and better too 

00:03:59.889 --> 00:04:00.919
 operate 

00:04:00.919 --> 00:04:03.979
 and dignity of her 

00:04:03.979 --> 00:04:06.979
 the playground according to kurier 

00:04:08.059 --> 00:04:09.409
 very easy 

00:04:09.409 --> 00:04:11.449
 8 

00:04:11.449 --> 00:04:15.379
 no word telephones on a contribution to video separation quality viewing 

00:04:15.379 --> 00:04:18.959
 is just how much there is yes 

00:04:20.430 --> 00:04:24.289
 but now you see the van der linden party youtube explains differently 

00:04:24.289 --> 00:04:27.300
 then with the iphone and is also really very beautiful 

00:04:27.300 --> 00:04:32.030
 we look a bit further and I actually didn't want the pastor either 

00:04:32.030 --> 00:04:36.130
 the first two containers are different then a nice thing is possible 

00:04:36.130 --> 00:04:38.349
 that is of course very nice 

00:04:38.349 --> 00:04:39.469
 Ajax 

00:04:39.469 --> 00:04:41.319

00:04:45.089 --> 00:04:48.089
 existing rooms 

00:04:49.020 --> 00:04:52.020

00:04:55.460 --> 00:04:56.759
 asterisk 

00:04:56.759 --> 00:04:59.759

 the Swiss once again stop that moment the day before 

00:05:17.879 --> 00:05:21.199

 standard version that does not work 

00:06:05.300 --> 00:06:07.279
 where it is now mainly fun 

00:06:07.279 --> 00:06:09.509
 those in their own path on the roads 

00:06:09.509 --> 00:06:11.909
