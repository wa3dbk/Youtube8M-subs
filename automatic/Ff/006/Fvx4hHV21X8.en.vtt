00:00:06.550 --> 00:00:14.389
 so not 

00:00:08.780 --> 00:00:17.689
 tom as a normal machine stupidly dried 

00:00:14.389 --> 00:00:23.090
 over the summer and we just formed 

00:00:17.689 --> 00:00:27.380
 swamps and watch this swamp it if 

00:00:23.090 --> 00:00:31.340
 watch is just a bog all 

00:00:27.380 --> 00:00:32.870
 staggers underfoot and really if shot down 

00:00:31.340 --> 00:00:37.040
 in such a swamp duck 

00:00:32.870 --> 00:00:40.309
 then even if you have a dog she 

00:00:37.040 --> 00:00:41.690
 jump into this swamp and you can write 

00:00:40.309 --> 00:00:44.929
 lost dog 

00:00:41.690 --> 00:00:48.050
 because you're here and not get no 

00:00:44.929 --> 00:00:51.530
 the duck is not a dog climb themselves for the dog 

00:00:48.050 --> 00:00:55.399
 you will risk your life in order 

00:00:51.530 --> 00:00:57.710
 to get such a swamp duck I you 

00:00:55.399 --> 00:01:00.289
 will show one fixture now I'm 

00:00:57.710 --> 00:01:04.699
 I'll go fix the camera and tell you about 

00:01:00.289 --> 00:01:07.010
 this device is generally seen 

00:01:04.699 --> 00:01:09.350
 the swamp which showed that is there 

00:01:07.010 --> 00:01:12.130
 the dog is useless to let if we 

00:01:09.350 --> 00:01:15.049
 let's run a dog there she will just drown 

00:01:12.130 --> 00:01:18.259
 at least it was a little water and then 

00:01:15.049 --> 00:01:20.930
 she went and so she and will delay 

00:01:18.259 --> 00:01:23.840
 marshes so in order to get 

00:01:20.930 --> 00:01:26.570
 skirt with such a swamp we need 

00:01:23.840 --> 00:01:29.270
 we will need the following simple 

00:01:26.570 --> 00:01:30.229
 spinning here this spinning is my 

00:01:29.270 --> 00:01:33.530
 some old 

00:01:30.229 --> 00:01:36.799
 when i started fishing found my 

00:01:33.530 --> 00:01:40.149
 I have a garage where I apply to him 

00:01:36.799 --> 00:01:41.960
 she and that the tip was strong 

00:01:40.149 --> 00:01:43.869
 broken tip 

00:01:41.960 --> 00:01:47.000
 there is a completely different ring here 

00:01:43.869 --> 00:01:49.640
 so how would he have a large elasticity 

00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:55.520
 and duck it stands easily I think it 

00:01:49.640 --> 00:01:57.859
 same geese, it will be focus is no further 

00:01:55.520 --> 00:02:02.090
 I put a simple coil too 

00:01:57.859 --> 00:02:05.869
 old back is not working normally 

00:02:02.090 --> 00:02:08.060
 i need enough of them and in principle for 

00:02:05.869 --> 00:02:11.900
 there to throw a fishing 

00:02:08.060 --> 00:02:16.250
 several times and do not put fishing line 

00:02:11.900 --> 00:02:18.379
 it became his 035 and here I have this 

00:02:16.250 --> 00:02:21.349
 this import is also quite enough 

00:02:18.379 --> 00:02:22.080
 fishing line how many tutyki there kilogram 

00:02:21.349 --> 00:02:24.750
 shooting 

00:02:22.080 --> 00:02:26.070
 pulling it out is easy to understand that we don’t 

00:02:24.750 --> 00:02:28.260
 only boat she still 

00:02:26.070 --> 00:02:32.130
 resists cheerfulness cats through 

00:02:28.260 --> 00:02:33.900
 which we pull and the marshes give 

00:02:32.130 --> 00:02:35.880
 its resistance well basically it 

00:02:33.900 --> 00:02:37.910
 fishing line she's there something up to 10 kilograms 

00:02:35.880 --> 00:02:41.730
 maintains this hand enough for me 

00:02:37.910 --> 00:02:44.250
 further what we do we take on the fishing line 

00:02:41.730 --> 00:02:48.350
 knit here 

00:02:44.250 --> 00:02:55.220
 tees are tees 

00:02:48.350 --> 00:03:01.800
 I'll take off the cambric who put on and show 

00:02:55.220 --> 00:03:04.080
 so afraid that is to scaffold regardless 

00:03:01.800 --> 00:03:05.030
 what knot in this tie knit here 

00:03:04.080 --> 00:03:08.370
 so tees 

00:03:05.030 --> 00:03:10.560
 but if we throw this whole 

00:03:08.370 --> 00:03:12.720
 tees design will hang in 

00:03:10.560 --> 00:03:16.709
 this position and they will not help us 

00:03:12.720 --> 00:03:19.860
 hook a duck so i 'm doing with 

00:03:16.709 --> 00:03:25.430
 drip that's such a cambric and this 

00:03:19.860 --> 00:03:30.290
 Kebrik bend on the hook on the ear of the hook 

00:03:25.430 --> 00:03:34.709
 to guide the line along 

00:03:30.290 --> 00:03:38.459
 along this extremely to the contact nenko 

00:03:34.709 --> 00:03:45.360
 Found and all tee I am hanging along 

00:03:38.459 --> 00:03:47.480
 fishing line well so here and so I cling 3 

00:03:45.360 --> 00:03:50.930
 extremely to 

00:03:47.480 --> 00:03:54.570
 through and I know that 30 centimeters probably 

00:03:50.930 --> 00:03:57.260
 more I retreat a little and cling 

00:03:54.570 --> 00:04:00.630
 the float this float did not find on the river 

00:03:57.260 --> 00:04:01.489
 this kind of network float inside i 

00:04:00.630 --> 00:04:04.590
 scored 

00:04:01.489 --> 00:04:07.410
 weights that secured this line 

00:04:04.590 --> 00:04:08.400
 weights need to make it easier 

00:04:07.410 --> 00:04:12.540
 to throw 

00:04:08.400 --> 00:04:15.810
 pinin and he plays another role when 

00:04:12.540 --> 00:04:18.390
 the float drops water he is on one third 

00:04:15.810 --> 00:04:21.209
 immersed in water when we pull it 

00:04:18.390 --> 00:04:24.330
 it creates a certain resistance and 

00:04:21.209 --> 00:04:27.720
 the key and don't drag on the water they rise 

00:04:24.330 --> 00:04:30.210
 at an angle the float stretches across the water 

00:04:27.720 --> 00:04:32.850
 hooks at an angle and hooks do not push 

00:04:30.210 --> 00:04:33.540
 water and it turns out we do not type on them 

00:04:32.850 --> 00:04:37.080
 no 

00:04:33.540 --> 00:04:39.630
 garbage they do not seem to fall asleep for 

00:04:37.080 --> 00:04:43.770
 vigor everything goes fine only 

00:04:39.630 --> 00:04:47.460
 float on the water and so shot down we threw 

00:04:43.770 --> 00:04:50.430
 this tackle for the mind and and begin to pull 

00:04:47.460 --> 00:04:53.430
 as soon as we see that the float is suitable 

00:04:50.430 --> 00:04:57.420
 It’s enough for us to take these days 

00:04:53.430 --> 00:05:00.510
 tees put on duck do further 

00:04:57.420 --> 00:05:03.170
 sharp cutting 3 tees slam 

00:05:00.510 --> 00:05:06.480
 booth and we calmly pull the duck 

00:05:03.170 --> 00:05:10.170
 by the way this way you can not get 

00:05:06.480 --> 00:05:12.000
 only in the swamp hiv but also possible 

00:05:10.170 --> 00:05:12.900
 get and just in the water here for example 

00:05:12.000 --> 00:05:15.810
 now 

00:05:12.900 --> 00:05:19.140
 the river she has already cooled very much 

00:05:15.810 --> 00:05:20.330
 water is cold and water 

00:05:19.140 --> 00:05:23.970
 risk health 

00:05:20.330 --> 00:05:29.970
 Therefore, it is better to apply the brains so then 

00:05:23.970 --> 00:05:33.570
 to hurt here such a thing turns out 3 

00:05:29.970 --> 00:05:35.240
 threesome floats for sinker and 

00:05:33.570 --> 00:05:38.990
 simple back 

00:05:35.240 --> 00:05:41.540
 very easy throws far flies 

00:05:38.990 --> 00:05:44.220
 principle you can get 

00:05:41.540 --> 00:05:47.670
 my first idea was to do it 

00:05:44.220 --> 00:05:50.610
 tee this one and trim it 

00:05:47.670 --> 00:05:52.790
 a big one that is take a float and in 

00:05:50.610 --> 00:05:55.890
 him cut such a big tee 

00:05:52.790 --> 00:05:58.200
 big tee kinda cool i 

00:05:55.890 --> 00:06:01.050
 tried and even made such a design 

00:05:58.200 --> 00:06:05.630
 but then refused it in principle 

00:06:01.050 --> 00:06:08.940
 cool cool but when we throw 

00:06:05.630 --> 00:06:12.810
 spinning with such a float and tee 

00:06:08.940 --> 00:06:15.870
 instead of where not pure water is cheerfulness there 

00:06:12.810 --> 00:06:18.510
 or here for example their clean and while we 

00:06:15.870 --> 00:06:22.350
 reach duck float with tee 

00:06:18.510 --> 00:06:24.540
 he has been here a bunch of garbage and duck 

00:06:22.350 --> 00:06:26.490
 have nothing to hook it already such a bunch 

00:06:24.540 --> 00:06:29.810
 garbage give it to me yes ducks 

00:06:26.490 --> 00:06:34.400
 so I abandoned this idea and 

00:06:29.810 --> 00:06:37.560
 passed like this way that is 

00:06:34.400 --> 00:06:39.330
 we throw a float floats tees in 

00:06:37.560 --> 00:06:41.790
 air only 

00:06:39.330 --> 00:06:45.150
 reached the duck put on a smile pulled 

00:06:41.790 --> 00:06:45.729
 at least one of the three will hook on 

00:06:45.150 --> 00:06:49.330
 smile 

00:06:45.729 --> 00:06:51.610
 the more you need to aim precisely at 

00:06:49.330 --> 00:06:54.490
 the neck of the duck that is to put on the neck 

00:06:51.610 --> 00:06:57.069
 shyah it has no great plumage and 

00:06:54.490 --> 00:07:01.210
 very easy to detect 

00:06:57.069 --> 00:07:04.589
 tee here is such a little idea for those 

00:07:01.210 --> 00:07:08.159
 who does not have a dog who does not want to eat I will 

00:07:04.589 --> 00:07:11.379
 can apply is made easy 

00:07:08.159 --> 00:07:14.379
 almost a penny this whole thing 

00:07:11.379 --> 00:07:16.089
 because spinning is the same this is some 

00:07:14.379 --> 00:07:18.370
 the simplest spinnings 

00:07:16.089 --> 00:07:20.649
 I do not think that he will be more than 50 hryvnia 

00:07:18.370 --> 00:07:22.899
 not worth it and I think everyone will find 

00:07:20.649 --> 00:07:23.580
 rod from which you can make such 

00:07:22.899 --> 00:07:27.490
 back 

00:07:23.580 --> 00:07:30.849
 triplet float and everything is on it all up 

00:07:27.490 --> 00:07:34.680
 meeting soon I will share super ideas 

00:07:30.849 --> 00:07:34.680
 in the next video bye
