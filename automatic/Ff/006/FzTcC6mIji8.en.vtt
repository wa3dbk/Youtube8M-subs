hello<00:00:01.979> welcome<00:00:02.310> to<00:00:02.520> another<00:00:02.850> mobile<00:00:03.149> computer

00:00:03.889 --> 00:00:03.899 
hello welcome to another mobile computer

00:00:03.899 --> 00:00:05.990 
hello welcome to another mobile computer
video<00:00:04.080> review<00:00:04.650> today<00:00:05.520> we're<00:00:05.730> going<00:00:05.850> to<00:00:05.910> be

00:00:05.990 --> 00:00:06.000 
video review today we're going to be

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:09.640 
video review today we're going to be
taking<00:00:06.150> a<00:00:06.390> look<00:00:06.600> at<00:00:06.810> the<00:00:07.080> advent<00:00:07.799> 4211

00:00:09.640 --> 00:00:09.650 
taking a look at the advent 4211

00:00:09.650 --> 00:00:14.240 
taking a look at the advent 4211
essentially<00:00:10.650> just<00:00:11.160> a<00:00:11.309> rebadged<00:00:11.840> msi<00:00:12.840> win<00:00:13.410> but

00:00:14.240 --> 00:00:14.250 
essentially just a rebadged msi win but

00:00:14.250 --> 00:00:17.450 
essentially just a rebadged msi win but
at<00:00:14.549> a<00:00:14.580> slightly<00:00:15.299> lower<00:00:15.450> price<00:00:16.100> and<00:00:17.100> as<00:00:17.190> you<00:00:17.340> can

00:00:17.450 --> 00:00:17.460 
at a slightly lower price and as you can

00:00:17.460 --> 00:00:20.660 
at a slightly lower price and as you can
see<00:00:17.490> if<00:00:17.730> you've<00:00:17.850> seen<00:00:18.060> the<00:00:18.560> msi<00:00:19.560> wind<00:00:19.670> photos

00:00:20.660 --> 00:00:20.670 
see if you've seen the msi wind photos

00:00:20.670 --> 00:00:23.900 
see if you've seen the msi wind photos
or<00:00:20.699> videos<00:00:21.390> obviously<00:00:22.220> the<00:00:23.220> advent<00:00:23.609> is

00:00:23.900 --> 00:00:23.910 
or videos obviously the advent is

00:00:23.910 --> 00:00:27.050 
or videos obviously the advent is
different<00:00:24.600> color<00:00:24.810> this<00:00:25.320> is<00:00:25.939> kind<00:00:26.939> of<00:00:27.000> a

00:00:27.050 --> 00:00:27.060 
different color this is kind of a

00:00:27.060 --> 00:00:30.650 
different color this is kind of a
slightly<00:00:27.689> sparkly<00:00:28.410> black<00:00:29.189> but<00:00:29.939> it<00:00:30.210> is

00:00:30.650 --> 00:00:30.660 
slightly sparkly black but it is

00:00:30.660 --> 00:00:33.500 
slightly sparkly black but it is
literally<00:00:31.529> identical<00:00:31.859> to<00:00:32.520> the<00:00:32.640> msi<00:00:33.000> wind<00:00:33.030> it

00:00:33.500 --> 00:00:33.510 
literally identical to the msi wind it

00:00:33.510 --> 00:00:37.510 
literally identical to the msi wind it
has<00:00:33.660> the<00:00:34.190> same<00:00:35.190> shape<00:00:36.000> mood<00:00:36.450> same<00:00:36.750> chassis

00:00:37.510 --> 00:00:37.520 
has the same shape mood same chassis

00:00:37.520 --> 00:00:42.369 
has the same shape mood same chassis
it's<00:00:38.520> identical<00:00:39.210> the<00:00:40.079> inside<00:00:40.940> same<00:00:41.940> keyboard

00:00:42.369 --> 00:00:42.379 
it's identical the inside same keyboard

00:00:42.379 --> 00:00:46.430 
it's identical the inside same keyboard
same<00:00:43.379> button<00:00:44.160> layout<00:00:44.399> everything<00:00:44.879> yeah<00:00:45.440> and

00:00:46.430 --> 00:00:46.440 
same button layout everything yeah and

00:00:46.440 --> 00:00:48.799 
same button layout everything yeah and
if<00:00:46.620> you<00:00:47.039> need<00:00:47.190> further<00:00:47.399> proof<00:00:47.550> that<00:00:47.969> it<00:00:48.210> is

00:00:48.799 --> 00:00:48.809 
if you need further proof that it is

00:00:48.809 --> 00:00:51.350 
if you need further proof that it is
identical<00:00:49.440> to<00:00:49.469> the<00:00:49.800> msi<00:00:50.250> wind<00:00:50.280> you<00:00:51.030> can<00:00:51.180> see

00:00:51.350 --> 00:00:51.360 
identical to the msi wind you can see

00:00:51.360 --> 00:00:55.400 
identical to the msi wind you can see
that<00:00:51.390> it<00:00:51.629> even<00:00:51.989> takes<00:00:52.649> the<00:00:53.190> msi<00:00:53.940> wind<00:00:54.410> battery

00:00:55.400 --> 00:00:55.410 
that it even takes the msi wind battery

00:00:55.410 --> 00:00:58.040 
that it even takes the msi wind battery
and<00:00:55.590> I've<00:00:55.890> taken<00:00:56.640> the<00:00:57.120> ability<00:00:57.629> of<00:00:57.660> stopping

00:00:58.040 --> 00:00:58.050 
and I've taken the ability of stopping

00:00:58.050 --> 00:01:00.410 
and I've taken the ability of stopping
the<00:00:58.140> two<00:00:58.289> round<00:00:58.590> here<00:00:59.489> just<00:01:00.059> to<00:01:00.149> give<00:01:00.270> you<00:01:00.390> a

00:01:00.410 --> 00:01:00.420 
the two round here just to give you a

00:01:00.420 --> 00:01:03.290 
the two round here just to give you a
comparison<00:01:00.780> if<00:01:01.289> you<00:01:01.440> want<00:01:01.969> your<00:01:02.969> little

00:01:03.290 --> 00:01:03.300 
comparison if you want your little

00:01:03.300 --> 00:01:07.179 
comparison if you want your little
further<00:01:03.570> proof<00:01:03.870> here<00:01:04.290> we<00:01:04.500> have<00:01:04.650> the<00:01:04.860> msi<00:01:05.790> wind

00:01:07.179 --> 00:01:07.189 
further proof here we have the msi wind

00:01:07.189 --> 00:01:10.700 
further proof here we have the msi wind
running<00:01:08.189> the<00:01:08.340> the<00:01:09.330> advent<00:01:09.689> battery<00:01:10.140> so<00:01:10.439> i'll

00:01:10.700 --> 00:01:10.710 
running the the advent battery so i'll

00:01:10.710 --> 00:01:13.670 
running the the advent battery so i'll
put<00:01:10.860> the<00:01:10.950> two<00:01:11.070> side<00:01:11.310> by<00:01:11.460> side<00:01:11.570> so<00:01:12.570> you<00:01:12.600> can<00:01:12.720> get

00:01:13.670 --> 00:01:13.680 
put the two side by side so you can get

00:01:13.680 --> 00:01:19.730 
put the two side by side so you can get
an<00:01:14.430> idea<00:01:14.610> of<00:01:14.909> how<00:01:15.119> they<00:01:15.270> look<00:01:18.380> send<00:01:19.380> what's<00:01:19.560> off

00:01:19.730 --> 00:01:19.740 
an idea of how they look send what's off

00:01:19.740 --> 00:01:21.200 
an idea of how they look send what's off
essentially<00:01:20.400> i'll<00:01:20.549> just<00:01:20.700> do<00:01:20.880> like<00:01:21.000> a<00:01:21.060> little

00:01:21.200 --> 00:01:21.210 
essentially i'll just do like a little

00:01:21.210 --> 00:01:25.700 
essentially i'll just do like a little
bit<00:01:21.509> so<00:01:21.689> you<00:01:21.750> can<00:01:23.659> get<00:01:24.659> a<00:01:24.720> bit<00:01:24.869> of<00:01:24.900> you<00:01:25.080> there<00:01:25.290> so

00:01:25.700 --> 00:01:25.710 
bit so you can get a bit of you there so

00:01:25.710 --> 00:01:28.520 
bit so you can get a bit of you there so
yeah<00:01:25.890> same<00:01:26.220> size<00:01:26.570> same<00:01:27.570> weight<00:01:27.840> actually<00:01:28.140> the

00:01:28.520 --> 00:01:28.530 
yeah same size same weight actually the

00:01:28.530 --> 00:01:31.969 
yeah same size same weight actually the
advent<00:01:29.400> is<00:01:29.610> about<00:01:29.939> 25<00:01:30.600> grams<00:01:30.900> lighter<00:01:31.170> for

00:01:31.969 --> 00:01:31.979 
advent is about 25 grams lighter for

00:01:31.979 --> 00:01:33.649 
advent is about 25 grams lighter for
some<00:01:32.130> reason<00:01:32.490> not<00:01:32.820> quite<00:01:33.030> sure<00:01:33.060> why<00:01:33.450> that<00:01:33.479> is

00:01:33.649 --> 00:01:33.659 
some reason not quite sure why that is

00:01:33.659 --> 00:01:35.810 
some reason not quite sure why that is
perhaps<00:01:34.350> there's<00:01:34.650> more<00:01:34.680> files<00:01:35.159> for<00:01:35.549> stolen

00:01:35.810 --> 00:01:35.820 
perhaps there's more files for stolen

00:01:35.820 --> 00:01:38.300 
perhaps there's more files for stolen
the<00:01:35.909> harddrive<00:01:36.619> hoping<00:01:37.619> that<00:01:37.740> waiter<00:01:37.920> a

00:01:38.300 --> 00:01:38.310 
the harddrive hoping that waiter a

00:01:38.310 --> 00:01:41.770 
the harddrive hoping that waiter a
little<00:01:38.759> bit<00:01:38.990> that's<00:01:39.990> a<00:01:40.079> joke<00:01:40.320> obviously<00:01:40.680> and

00:01:41.770 --> 00:01:41.780 
little bit that's a joke obviously and

00:01:41.780 --> 00:01:46.340 
little bit that's a joke obviously and
so<00:01:42.780> yeah<00:01:42.930> I'll<00:01:43.200> people<00:01:44.659> I'll<00:01:45.659> try<00:01:46.020> and<00:01:46.079> show

00:01:46.340 --> 00:01:46.350 
so yeah I'll people I'll try and show

00:01:46.350 --> 00:01:48.740 
so yeah I'll people I'll try and show
them<00:01:46.560> from<00:01:46.860> from<00:01:47.790> essentially<00:01:48.210> every<00:01:48.479> angle

00:01:48.740 --> 00:01:48.750 
them from from essentially every angle

00:01:48.750 --> 00:01:51.380 
them from from essentially every angle
button<00:01:49.259> I<00:01:49.579> can<00:01:50.579> assure<00:01:50.670> you<00:01:50.850> that<00:01:51.060> they<00:01:51.360> are

00:01:51.380 --> 00:01:51.390 
button I can assure you that they are

00:01:51.390 --> 00:01:55.249 
button I can assure you that they are
the<00:01:52.350> same<00:01:52.590> laptop<00:01:53.689> we<00:01:54.689> take<00:01:54.869> a<00:01:54.899> look<00:01:55.079> inside

00:01:55.249 --> 00:01:55.259 
the same laptop we take a look inside

00:01:55.259 --> 00:01:57.830 
the same laptop we take a look inside
the<00:01:55.590> two<00:01:55.799> I<00:01:56.390> mentioned<00:01:57.390> just<00:01:57.570> now<00:01:57.630> add<00:01:57.780> the

00:01:57.830 --> 00:01:57.840 
the two I mentioned just now add the

00:01:57.840 --> 00:02:01.249 
the two I mentioned just now add the
keyboards<00:01:58.439> by<00:01:58.710> the<00:01:58.770> same<00:01:59.100> but<00:01:59.969> I<00:02:00.110> see<00:02:01.110> for

00:02:01.249 --> 00:02:01.259 
keyboards by the same but I see for

00:02:01.259 --> 00:02:06.290 
keyboards by the same but I see for
yourself

00:02:06.290 --> 00:02:06.300 

00:02:06.300 --> 00:02:10.770 

you<00:02:07.300> might<00:02:07.780> remember<00:02:07.870> the<00:02:08.399> we<00:02:09.399> praised<00:02:10.240> the

00:02:10.770 --> 00:02:10.780 
you might remember the we praised the

00:02:10.780 --> 00:02:13.350 
you might remember the we praised the
wind<00:02:10.990> for<00:02:11.320> having<00:02:11.560> V<00:02:11.800> the<00:02:12.580> double-height

00:02:13.350 --> 00:02:13.360 
wind for having V the double-height

00:02:13.360 --> 00:02:15.530 
wind for having V the double-height
Enter<00:02:13.840> key<00:02:13.870> but<00:02:14.260> you<00:02:14.440> get<00:02:14.560> the<00:02:14.680> same<00:02:14.860> thing<00:02:15.190> on

00:02:15.530 --> 00:02:15.540 
Enter key but you get the same thing on

00:02:15.540 --> 00:02:19.530 
Enter key but you get the same thing on
the<00:02:16.540> Advent<00:02:17.470> and<00:02:17.710> yeah<00:02:18.400> i<00:02:18.430> mean<00:02:18.640> i<00:02:18.700> can't<00:02:19.180> Liesl

00:02:19.530 --> 00:02:19.540 
the Advent and yeah i mean i can't Liesl

00:02:19.540 --> 00:02:20.610 
the Advent and yeah i mean i can't Liesl
anything<00:02:19.810> more<00:02:19.960> than<00:02:20.080> that<00:02:20.170> these<00:02:20.470> two

00:02:20.610 --> 00:02:20.620 
anything more than that these two

00:02:20.620 --> 00:02:23.460 
anything more than that these two
laptops<00:02:20.860> are<00:02:21.390> identical<00:02:22.390> and<00:02:22.570> if<00:02:23.200> you<00:02:23.290> are

00:02:23.460 --> 00:02:23.470 
laptops are identical and if you are

00:02:23.470 --> 00:02:25.170 
laptops are identical and if you are
concerned<00:02:24.010> about<00:02:24.130> such<00:02:24.430> things<00:02:24.640> you<00:02:24.880> can<00:02:25.000> see

00:02:25.170 --> 00:02:25.180 
concerned about such things you can see

00:02:25.180 --> 00:02:30.060 
concerned about such things you can see
that<00:02:25.950> the<00:02:26.950> wind<00:02:27.190> has<00:02:27.490> a<00:02:27.790> slight<00:02:28.720> screen<00:02:29.350> wobble

looks<00:04:47.800> pretty<00:04:48.070> pretty<00:04:48.760> stylish<00:04:49.300> and<00:04:49.750> if

wind<00:06:46.729> he<00:06:47.729> meet<00:06:48.150> agree<00:06:48.450> install<00:06:48.810> windows<00:06:49.440> XP<00:06:49.860> so

00:06:50.420 --> 00:06:50.430 
wind he meet agree install windows XP so

00:06:50.430 --> 00:06:51.800 
wind he meet agree install windows XP so
the<00:06:50.640> two<00:06:50.850> are<00:06:51.000> completely<00:06:51.330> interchangeable

00:06:51.800 --> 00:06:51.810 
the two are completely interchangeable

00:06:51.810 --> 00:06:55.700 
the two are completely interchangeable
so<00:06:52.620> that<00:06:52.800> we<00:06:52.889> gave<00:06:53.070> the<00:06:53.960> we<00:06:54.960> gave<00:06:55.169> the<00:06:55.290> msi<00:06:55.680> wind

00:06:55.700 --> 00:06:55.710 
so that we gave the we gave the msi wind

00:06:55.710 --> 00:06:59.090 
so that we gave the we gave the msi wind
five<00:06:56.280> out<00:06:56.490> of<00:06:56.520> six<00:06:56.880> when<00:06:57.240> we<00:06:57.330> reviewed<00:06:57.660> it<00:06:58.100> no

00:06:59.090 --> 00:06:59.100 
five out of six when we reviewed it no

00:06:59.100 --> 00:07:01.130 
five out of six when we reviewed it no
no<00:06:59.760> real<00:06:59.940> criticisms<00:07:00.510> other<00:07:00.720> than<00:07:00.870> the<00:07:00.990> fact

00:07:01.130 --> 00:07:01.140 
no real criticisms other than the fact

00:07:01.140 --> 00:07:04.640 
no real criticisms other than the fact
that<00:07:01.320> battery<00:07:01.860> is<00:07:02.479> much<00:07:03.479> smaller<00:07:03.810> than<00:07:04.200> not

00:07:04.640 --> 00:07:04.650 
that battery is much smaller than not

00:07:04.650 --> 00:07:06.620 
that battery is much smaller than not
only<00:07:04.860> we<00:07:04.979> expected<00:07:05.610> but<00:07:05.640> also<00:07:06.000> going<00:07:06.330> to<00:07:06.390> thank

00:07:06.620 --> 00:07:06.630 
only we expected but also going to thank

00:07:06.630 --> 00:07:08.810 
only we expected but also going to thank
you<00:07:06.870> you<00:07:07.350> would<00:07:07.500> reasonably<00:07:07.979> expect<00:07:08.490> for<00:07:08.729> the

00:07:08.810 --> 00:07:08.820 
you you would reasonably expect for the

00:07:08.820 --> 00:07:11.779 
you you would reasonably expect for the
for<00:07:08.970> the<00:07:09.000> price<00:07:09.270> in<00:07:10.020> a<00:07:10.080> 3<00:07:10.289> 360<00:07:11.130> pounds<00:07:11.310> of<00:07:11.610> vero

00:07:11.779 --> 00:07:11.789 
for the price in a 3 360 pounds of vero

00:07:11.789 --> 00:07:15.050 
for the price in a 3 360 pounds of vero
bets<00:07:12.030> so<00:07:12.780> you<00:07:13.110> know<00:07:13.260> 482<00:07:13.680> unless<00:07:14.070> you're

00:07:15.050 --> 00:07:15.060 
bets so you know 482 unless you're

00:07:15.060 --> 00:07:17.210 
bets so you know 482 unless you're
getting<00:07:15.300> an<00:07:15.450> identical<00:07:16.020> laptop<00:07:16.560> identical<00:07:17.190> in

00:07:17.210 --> 00:07:17.220 
getting an identical laptop identical in

00:07:17.220 --> 00:07:19.760 
getting an identical laptop identical in
every<00:07:17.400> respect<00:07:17.580> bottom<00:07:18.360> the<00:07:18.450> cover<00:07:18.770> obviously

00:07:19.760 --> 00:07:19.770 
every respect bottom the cover obviously

00:07:19.770 --> 00:07:24.050 
every respect bottom the cover obviously
and<00:07:20.060> so<00:07:21.060> I<00:07:21.390> think<00:07:21.600> if<00:07:22.500> you're<00:07:22.680> looking<00:07:22.950> for<00:07:23.060> an

00:07:24.050 --> 00:07:24.060 
and so I think if you're looking for an

00:07:24.060 --> 00:07:28.100 
and so I think if you're looking for an
inexpensive<00:07:24.479> netbook<00:07:25.910> and<00:07:26.910> you<00:07:27.510> don't<00:07:27.720> like

00:07:28.100 --> 00:07:28.110 
inexpensive netbook and you don't like

00:07:28.110 --> 00:07:31.219 
inexpensive netbook and you don't like
the<00:07:28.320> look<00:07:28.500> of<00:07:28.650> the<00:07:29.210> EPC<00:07:30.210> 901<00:07:30.870> which<00:07:31.050> is<00:07:31.140> a

00:07:31.219 --> 00:07:31.229 
the look of the EPC 901 which is a

00:07:31.229 --> 00:07:32.630 
the look of the EPC 901 which is a
little<00:07:31.650> bit<00:07:31.800> small<00:07:32.010> has<00:07:32.220> a<00:07:32.250> much<00:07:32.460> smaller

00:07:32.630 --> 00:07:32.640 
little bit small has a much smaller

00:07:32.640 --> 00:07:35.840 
little bit small has a much smaller
keyboard<00:07:32.910> and<00:07:33.620> the<00:07:34.620> advent<00:07:35.039> is<00:07:35.280> certainly<00:07:35.700> the

00:07:35.840 --> 00:07:35.850 
keyboard and the advent is certainly the

00:07:35.850 --> 00:07:38.900 
keyboard and the advent is certainly the
one<00:07:35.970> we're<00:07:36.300> going<00:07:36.450> to<00:07:36.539> be<00:07:36.660> recommending<00:07:37.910> so

00:07:38.900 --> 00:07:38.910 
one we're going to be recommending so

00:07:38.910 --> 00:07:41.659 
one we're going to be recommending so
when<00:07:39.120> we<00:07:39.210> post<00:07:39.390> a<00:07:39.630> review<00:07:39.830> later<00:07:40.830> on<00:07:41.160> in<00:07:41.370> the

00:07:41.659 --> 00:07:41.669 
when we post a review later on in the

00:07:41.669 --> 00:07:44.090 
when we post a review later on in the
day<00:07:41.729> you<00:07:41.910> can<00:07:42.300> see<00:07:42.510> our<00:07:43.289> full<00:07:43.470> verdicts<00:07:43.919> but

00:07:44.090 --> 00:07:44.100 
day you can see our full verdicts but

00:07:44.100 --> 00:07:46.640 
day you can see our full verdicts but
yet<00:07:44.340> at<00:07:44.460> this<00:07:44.580> stage<00:07:45.050> certainly<00:07:46.050> an<00:07:46.229> excellent

00:07:46.640 --> 00:07:46.650 
yet at this stage certainly an excellent

00:07:46.650 --> 00:07:48.740 
yet at this stage certainly an excellent
little<00:07:46.890> laptop<00:07:47.280> and<00:07:47.490> that<00:07:47.640> price<00:07:47.910> means<00:07:48.570> it

00:07:48.740 --> 00:07:48.750 
little laptop and that price means it

00:07:48.750 --> 00:07:53.660 
little laptop and that price means it
has<00:07:48.870> the<00:07:49.020> edge<00:07:49.140> over<00:07:49.830> the<00:07:49.940> excellent<00:07:50.940> msi<00:07:51.630> wind
