00:03:42.250 --> 00:03:42.260 
but not much really it just makes it a

00:03:42.260 --> 00:03:44.979 
but not much really it just makes it a
little<00:03:42.410> bit<00:03:42.739> weird<00:03:43.040> whenever<00:03:43.400> you<00:03:43.989> choose

00:03:44.979 --> 00:03:44.989

00:03:56.199 --> 00:03:56.209 
it was kind of a weird change other than

00:03:56.209 --> 00:03:59.530
