00:00:00.370 --> 00:00:05.020
 with the guys from u2 be well in a 

00:00:02.110 --> 00:00:07.240
 new minecraft video and version 20 

00:00:05.020 --> 00:00:10.150
 12.1 to soccer 

00:00:07.240 --> 00:00:12.070
 6 and good guys in this this time 

00:00:10.150 --> 00:00:13.960
 of added what had been the 

00:00:12.070 --> 00:00:16.780
 third person which to me has 

00:00:13.960 --> 00:00:19.030
 similar and good and another thing is also 

00:00:16.780 --> 00:00:21.070
 that the visualization of what was coming 

00:00:19.030 --> 00:00:22.660
 being the third person field of 

00:00:21.070 --> 00:00:25.330
 vision as you can see we can take it away 

00:00:22.660 --> 00:00:27.430
 we can bring it closer which is how it appears 

00:00:25.330 --> 00:00:30.520
 so it looks better and the third 

00:00:27.430 --> 00:00:36.030
 person is here what would be 

00:00:30.520 --> 00:00:38.960
 normal second person and third person 

00:00:36.030 --> 00:00:38.960
 the water and this 

00:00:39.930 --> 00:00:48.960
 you see the cbn u and they attack me they attack me vale 

00:00:44.739 --> 00:00:48.960
 It's cool but this is practically 

00:00:49.050 --> 00:00:53.649
 that is almost not used go unless 

00:00:51.940 --> 00:00:55.570
 is playing in a normal mode what I 

00:00:53.649 --> 00:00:59.500
 appeared is that a key was added 

00:00:55.570 --> 00:01:01.180
 here that was to change to the 

00:00:59.500 --> 00:01:03.579
 people or first person second 

00:01:01.180 --> 00:01:05.379
 person an extra button how is this 

00:01:03.579 --> 00:01:07.810
 message sounds placed one here in the 

00:01:05.379 --> 00:01:10.479
 corner wherever it had been 

00:01:07.810 --> 00:01:12.610
 better because it is that you imagine that I want 

00:01:10.479 --> 00:01:14.500
 play some hunger games or something like that 

00:01:12.610 --> 00:01:16.060
 and you want to come who comes back 

00:01:14.500 --> 00:01:18.460
 you want to see who is behind you 

00:01:16.060 --> 00:01:20.140
 Can you feel the canoe or is ibex dad the 

00:01:18.460 --> 00:01:21.970
 that comes back but to see what 

00:01:20.140 --> 00:01:25.720
 Benatar you have to go this for art 

00:01:21.970 --> 00:01:29.740
 first of all and give it here and dahlia 

00:01:25.720 --> 00:01:32.619
 falls and the truth is not very absurd or 

00:01:29.740 --> 00:01:34.990
 is casinos or talk and we are useless 

00:01:32.619 --> 00:01:36.819
 practically him from this person but 

00:01:34.990 --> 00:01:39.090
 for what I 'm doing here what 

00:01:36.819 --> 00:01:43.310
 I'm doing 

00:01:39.090 --> 00:01:45.049
 I think he's hitting me there 

00:01:43.310 --> 00:01:48.619
 for what I'm doing a series and 

00:01:45.049 --> 00:01:52.460
 otherwise it would be fine because I could do 

00:01:48.619 --> 00:01:55.040
 miniatures and things like that white for example 

00:01:52.460 --> 00:01:57.110
 what are you doing here and make a miniature of 

00:01:55.040 --> 00:01:59.600
 this good in the change that place even 

00:01:57.110 --> 00:02:01.580
 more remarkable so to speak the vision 

00:01:59.600 --> 00:02:03.920
 of field and ether and the third person 

00:02:01.580 --> 00:02:06.050
 for example there I place here and the 

00:02:03.920 --> 00:02:09.520
 field vision 

00:02:06.050 --> 00:02:09.520
 will be here 

00:02:09.890 --> 00:02:14.180
 they do not see 

00:02:11.630 --> 00:02:15.950
 that's why a field vision and we hide 

00:02:14.180 --> 00:02:18.950
 this and we can take out our miniature 

00:02:15.950 --> 00:02:21.510
 for example I am here and we already have 

00:02:18.950 --> 00:02:23.909
 miniature we can bend over 

00:02:21.510 --> 00:02:25.310
 and we have practically nature here and 

00:02:23.909 --> 00:02:27.080
 what 

00:02:25.310 --> 00:02:29.000
 this would be all for the video of 

00:02:27.080 --> 00:02:30.709
