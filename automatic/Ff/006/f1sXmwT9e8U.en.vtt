you know I've rebuilt some carburetors

00:01:41.100 --> 00:01:44.510 
you know I've rebuilt some carburetors
and<00:01:42.229> you'll<00:01:43.229> find<00:01:43.799> when<00:01:43.950> you<00:01:43.979> pull<00:01:44.189> the<00:01:44.280> bowls

00:01:44.510 --> 00:01:44.520 
and you'll find when you pull the bowls

00:01:44.520 --> 00:01:46.940 
and you'll find when you pull the bowls
down<00:01:44.820> some<00:01:45.210> of<00:01:45.329> them<00:01:45.450> with<00:01:45.570> a<00:01:45.600> ethanol<00:01:46.290> was<00:01:46.439> has

00:01:46.940 --> 00:01:46.950 
down some of them with a ethanol was has

00:01:46.950 --> 00:01:48.950 
down some of them with a ethanol was has
been<00:01:47.159> in<00:01:47.310> there<00:01:47.520> it's<00:01:48.270> for<00:01:48.479> us<00:01:48.600> to<00:01:48.720> the<00:01:48.810> bottom

00:01:48.950 --> 00:01:48.960 
been in there it's for us to the bottom

00:01:48.960 --> 00:01:52.490 
been in there it's for us to the bottom
of<00:01:49.200> the<00:01:49.259> bowls<00:01:49.500> and<00:01:50.180> it<00:01:51.180> clogs<00:01:51.720> up<00:01:51.930> the<00:01:52.049> Jets<00:01:52.320> at

00:01:52.490 --> 00:01:52.500 
of the bowls and it clogs up the Jets at

00:01:52.500 --> 00:01:55.660 
of the bowls and it clogs up the Jets at
that<00:01:52.649> fuel<00:01:52.860> sits<00:01:53.159> in<00:01:53.280> there<00:01:53.399> for<00:01:54.329> a<00:01:54.360> while<00:01:54.540> and

00:01:55.660 --> 00:01:55.670 
that fuel sits in there for a while and

00:01:55.670 --> 00:01:59.020 
that fuel sits in there for a while and
this<00:01:56.670> ferret<00:01:57.000> does<00:01:57.180> very<00:01:57.420> well<00:01:57.659> as<00:01:57.810> far<00:01:57.840> as

00:01:59.020 --> 00:01:59.030 
this ferret does very well as far as

00:01:59.030 --> 00:02:02.840 
this ferret does very well as far as
stabilizing<00:02:00.030> the<00:02:00.119> ethanol<00:02:00.420> and<00:02:01.850> eliminating

00:02:02.840 --> 00:02:02.850 
stabilizing the ethanol and eliminating

00:02:02.850 --> 00:02:05.959 
stabilizing the ethanol and eliminating
any<00:02:02.969> type<00:02:03.240> of<00:02:03.270> moisture<00:02:03.840> that<00:02:03.869> you<00:02:04.079> have<00:02:04.290> in<00:02:04.969> in

00:02:05.959 --> 00:02:05.969 
any type of moisture that you have in in

00:02:05.969 --> 00:02:08.719 
any type of moisture that you have in in
the<00:02:06.270> fuel<00:02:06.509> and<00:02:06.920> house<00:02:07.920> fuel<00:02:08.190> shelf<00:02:08.489> life

00:02:08.719 --> 00:02:08.729 
the fuel and house fuel shelf life

00:02:08.729 --> 00:02:10.960 
the fuel and house fuel shelf life
doesn't<00:02:09.119> seem<00:02:09.270> to<00:02:09.390> be<00:02:09.479> about<00:02:09.660> 30<00:02:09.929> days<00:02:10.110> anyway

00:02:10.960 --> 00:02:10.970 
doesn't seem to be about 30 days anyway

00:02:10.970 --> 00:02:13.250 
doesn't seem to be about 30 days anyway
so<00:02:11.970> if<00:02:12.090> you<00:02:12.180> got<00:02:12.330> fuel<00:02:12.569> that<00:02:12.660> sits<00:02:12.900> around<00:02:13.020> this

00:02:13.250 --> 00:02:13.260 
so if you got fuel that sits around this

00:02:13.260 --> 00:02:13.760 
so if you got fuel that sits around this
is<00:02:13.379> good<00:02:13.620> too

00:02:13.760 --> 00:02:13.770 
is good too

00:02:13.770 --> 00:02:19.820 
is good too
puttin<00:02:13.920> it<00:02:14.810> also<00:02:15.810> I<00:02:15.990> use<00:02:17.870> Lucas<00:02:18.870> fuel<00:02:19.140> injector

00:02:19.820 --> 00:02:19.830 
puttin it also I use Lucas fuel injector

00:02:19.830 --> 00:02:21.380 
puttin it also I use Lucas fuel injector
treatment<00:02:20.190> I<00:02:20.250> use<00:02:20.400> this<00:02:20.520> at<00:02:20.670> all<00:02:20.790> my<00:02:20.910> vehicles

00:02:21.380 --> 00:02:21.390 
treatment I use this at all my vehicles

00:02:21.390 --> 00:02:23.050 
treatment I use this at all my vehicles
and<00:02:21.510> stuff<00:02:21.570> this<00:02:21.900> is<00:02:22.050> good<00:02:22.260> if<00:02:22.410> you<00:02:22.500> want<00:02:22.680> to

00:02:23.050 --> 00:02:23.060

00:02:34.100 --> 00:02:34.110 
fuel mileage too I seem to get a couple

00:02:34.110 --> 00:02:37.310 
fuel mileage too I seem to get a couple
more<00:02:34.230> miles<00:02:34.440> per<00:02:34.590> gallon<00:02:35.180> I<00:02:36.180> add<00:02:36.780> that<00:02:36.930> every

00:02:37.310 --> 00:02:37.320 
more miles per gallon I add that every

00:02:37.320 --> 00:02:44.740 
more miles per gallon I add that every
every<00:02:38.280> month<00:02:38.520> or<00:02:38.730> so<00:02:38.760> to<00:02:39.290> my<00:02:40.290> truck<00:02:42.680> this<00:02:43.680> is<00:02:43.740> a
