probably<00:01:21.900> just<00:01:22.080> laying<00:01:22.229> the<00:01:22.380> initial<00:01:22.710> sketch

00:01:22.880 --> 00:01:22.890 
probably just laying the initial sketch

00:01:22.890 --> 00:01:24.740 
probably just laying the initial sketch
on<00:01:23.070> the<00:01:23.159> wall<00:01:23.340> yeah<00:01:23.940> I<00:01:24.120> think<00:01:24.240> a<00:01:24.330> lot<00:01:24.479> of<00:01:24.510> times

00:01:24.740 --> 00:01:24.750 
on the wall yeah I think a lot of times

00:01:24.750 --> 00:01:28.070 
on the wall yeah I think a lot of times
I<00:01:25.080> walk<00:01:25.380> away<00:01:26.060> and<00:01:27.060> I<00:01:27.180> take<00:01:27.659> these<00:01:27.810> progress

00:01:28.070 --> 00:01:28.080 
I walk away and I take these progress

00:01:28.080 --> 00:01:30.500 
I walk away and I take these progress
shots<00:01:28.530> throughout<00:01:29.010> my<00:01:29.400> painting<00:01:29.790> process<00:01:29.970> and

00:01:30.500 --> 00:01:30.510 
shots throughout my painting process and

00:01:30.510 --> 00:01:32.150 
shots throughout my painting process and
every<00:01:30.990> time<00:01:31.140> I<00:01:31.230> look<00:01:31.380> at<00:01:31.440> them<00:01:31.620> later<00:01:31.740> the

00:01:32.150 --> 00:01:32.160 
every time I look at them later the

00:01:32.160 --> 00:01:33.650 
every time I look at them later the
sketch<00:01:32.430> on<00:01:32.640> the<00:01:32.700> wall<00:01:32.850> usually<00:01:33.270> ends<00:01:33.420> up<00:01:33.450> being

00:01:33.650 --> 00:01:33.660 
sketch on the wall usually ends up being

00:01:33.660 --> 00:01:35.390 
sketch on the wall usually ends up being
my<00:01:33.750> favorite<00:01:34.170> it's<00:01:34.830> not<00:01:34.950> to<00:01:35.040> say<00:01:35.130> that<00:01:35.190> I<00:01:35.310> don't

00:01:35.390 --> 00:01:35.400 
my favorite it's not to say that I don't

00:01:35.400 --> 00:01:37.430 
my favorite it's not to say that I don't
like<00:01:35.670> my<00:01:35.880> finished<00:01:36.210> pieces<00:01:36.420> but<00:01:36.870> for<00:01:37.320> some

00:01:37.430 --> 00:01:37.440 
like my finished pieces but for some

00:01:37.440 --> 00:01:39.050 
like my finished pieces but for some
reason<00:01:37.740> that<00:01:37.770> just<00:01:37.980> always<00:01:38.310> looks<00:01:38.580> best<00:01:38.760> to<00:01:38.940> me

00:01:39.050 --> 00:01:39.060 
reason that just always looks best to me

00:01:39.060 --> 00:01:40.640 
reason that just always looks best to me
is<00:01:39.660> it<00:01:39.810> like<00:01:39.960> because<00:01:40.140> you're<00:01:40.260> kind<00:01:40.440> of<00:01:40.470> like

00:01:40.640 --> 00:01:40.650 
is it like because you're kind of like

00:01:40.650 --> 00:01:46.820 
is it like because you're kind of like
getting<00:01:44.870> its<00:01:45.870> before<00:01:46.200> there's<00:01:46.380> any<00:01:46.500> pressure

00:01:46.820 --> 00:01:46.830 
getting its before there's any pressure

00:01:46.830 --> 00:01:48.200 
getting its before there's any pressure
and<00:01:47.160> before<00:01:47.490> you're<00:01:47.610> trying<00:01:47.850> to<00:01:47.970> really

00:01:48.200 --> 00:01:48.210 
and before you're trying to really

00:01:48.210 --> 00:01:49.640 
and before you're trying to really
create<00:01:48.450> something<00:01:48.720> completed<00:01:49.320> in<00:01:49.410> so<00:01:49.560> you're

00:01:49.640 --> 00:01:49.650 
create something completed in so you're

00:01:49.650 --> 00:01:52.700 
create something completed in so you're
just<00:01:49.740> kind<00:01:49.950> of<00:01:49.980> more<00:01:50.190> free<00:01:51.090> and<00:01:51.530> not<00:01:52.530> so

00:01:52.700 --> 00:01:52.710 
just kind of more free and not so

00:01:52.710 --> 00:01:54.200 
just kind of more free and not so
concerned<00:01:52.890> and<00:01:53.340> you're<00:01:53.460> less<00:01:53.640> stressed<00:01:53.670> out

00:01:54.200 --> 00:01:54.210 
concerned and you're less stressed out

00:01:54.210 --> 00:01:55.940 
concerned and you're less stressed out
and<00:01:54.450> you're<00:01:54.540> just<00:01:54.620> creating<00:01:55.620> more<00:01:55.650> of<00:01:55.890> an

00:01:55.940 --> 00:01:55.950 
and you're just creating more of an

00:01:55.950 --> 00:01:57.650 
and you're just creating more of an
organic<00:01:56.220> flow<00:01:56.610> of<00:01:56.760> putting<00:01:57.060> paint<00:01:57.240> on<00:01:57.420> a<00:01:57.450> wall

00:01:57.650 --> 00:01:57.660 
organic flow of putting paint on a wall

00:01:57.660 --> 00:01:59.630 
organic flow of putting paint on a wall
and<00:01:58.260> I<00:01:58.470> just<00:01:58.680> think<00:01:58.800> that<00:01:58.950> the<00:01:59.100> sketch<00:01:59.340> always

00:01:59.630 --> 00:01:59.640 
and I just think that the sketch always

00:01:59.640 --> 00:02:02.480 
and I just think that the sketch always
is<00:01:59.910> up<00:02:00.030> looking<00:02:00.330> you<00:02:00.620> know<00:02:01.620> the<00:02:01.980> best<00:02:02.190> part<00:02:02.460> of

00:02:02.480 --> 00:02:02.490 
is up looking you know the best part of

00:02:02.490 --> 00:02:05.060 
is up looking you know the best part of
a<00:02:02.580> piece<00:02:02.760> that's<00:02:03.540> really<00:02:03.840> interesting<00:02:04.110> it's

00:02:05.060 --> 00:02:05.070 
a piece that's really interesting it's

00:02:05.070 --> 00:02:06.770 
a piece that's really interesting it's
really<00:02:05.130> cool<00:02:05.520> to<00:02:05.640> see<00:02:05.820> like<00:02:05.850> how<00:02:06.180> so<00:02:06.660> many

00:02:06.770 --> 00:02:06.780

00:02:23.519 --> 00:02:25.940 
it's a very organic part I really like
doing<00:02:23.700> characters<00:02:24.209> cuz<00:02:24.480> I<00:02:24.569> like<00:02:24.720> the<00:02:25.500> movement

00:02:25.940 --> 00:02:25.950 
doing characters cuz I like the movement

00:02:25.950 --> 00:02:29.390 
doing characters cuz I like the movement
that<00:02:26.069> they<00:02:26.280> create<00:02:26.640> the<00:02:27.120> how<00:02:27.989> it<00:02:28.220> brings<00:02:29.220> a

00:02:29.390 --> 00:02:29.400 
that they create the how it brings a

00:02:29.400 --> 00:02:30.830 
that they create the how it brings a
piece<00:02:29.610> together<00:02:29.819> it<00:02:30.209> makes<00:02:30.390> everything<00:02:30.659> look

00:02:30.830 --> 00:02:30.840 
piece together it makes everything look

00:02:41.060 --> 00:02:41.070 
cutting back your stuff yeah so when I

00:02:41.070 --> 00:02:43.220 
cutting back your stuff yeah so when I
paint<00:02:41.340> I<00:02:41.580> tend<00:02:41.820> to<00:02:41.880> cut<00:02:42.480> back<00:02:42.690> a<00:02:42.720> lot<00:02:43.020> of<00:02:43.050> the

00:02:43.220 --> 00:02:43.230 
paint I tend to cut back a lot of the

00:02:43.230 --> 00:02:45.020 
paint I tend to cut back a lot of the
lines<00:02:43.440> just<00:02:44.130> to<00:02:44.250> make<00:02:44.460> sure<00:02:44.490> things<00:02:44.880> look

00:02:45.020 --> 00:02:45.030 
lines just to make sure things look

00:02:45.030 --> 00:02:47.300 
lines just to make sure things look
crisp<00:02:45.360> and<00:02:45.930> that<00:02:46.200> just<00:02:46.410> entails<00:02:46.740> laying<00:02:47.130> down

00:02:47.300 --> 00:02:47.310 
crisp and that just entails laying down

00:02:47.310 --> 00:02:49.400 
crisp and that just entails laying down
one<00:02:47.550> line<00:02:47.730> and<00:02:48.420> then<00:02:48.630> cutting<00:02:48.900> back<00:02:49.050> with<00:02:49.290> the

00:02:49.400 --> 00:02:49.410 
one line and then cutting back with the

00:02:49.410 --> 00:02:51.800 
one line and then cutting back with the
other<00:02:49.560> color<00:02:49.890> just<00:02:50.700> so<00:02:50.820> you<00:02:50.940> get<00:02:51.060> nice<00:02:51.270> crispy

00:02:51.800 --> 00:02:51.810 
other color just so you get nice crispy

00:02:51.810 --> 00:02:53.690 
other color just so you get nice crispy
lines<00:02:51.990> it's<00:02:52.500> a<00:02:52.620> technique<00:02:53.070> that<00:02:53.280> you<00:02:53.370> can<00:02:53.550> use

00:02:53.690 --> 00:02:53.700 
lines it's a technique that you can use

00:02:53.700 --> 00:02:56.570 
lines it's a technique that you can use
that<00:02:53.970> makes<00:02:54.240> your<00:02:54.570> pieces<00:02:54.990> look<00:02:55.320> finished<00:02:56.040> you

00:03:03.050 --> 00:03:03.060 
from cutting back lines once in a while

00:03:03.060 --> 00:03:04.610 
from cutting back lines once in a while
just<00:03:03.090> to<00:03:03.330> kind<00:03:03.600> of<00:03:03.630> make<00:03:03.930> the<00:03:04.050> piece<00:03:04.230> look<00:03:04.470> like

00:03:04.610 --> 00:03:04.620 
just to kind of make the piece look like

00:03:04.620 --> 00:03:06.440 
just to kind of make the piece look like
a<00:03:04.650> finished<00:03:04.920> product<00:03:05.310> and<00:03:05.610> make<00:03:06.090> it<00:03:06.210> look<00:03:06.300> as

00:03:06.440 --> 00:03:06.450 
a finished product and make it look as

a finished product and make it look as
clean<00:03:06.750> as<00:03:06.870> possible<00:03:08.240> what<00:03:09.240> do<00:03:09.330> you<00:03:09.390> think

00:03:09.530 --> 00:03:09.540 
clean as possible what do you think

00:03:09.540 --> 00:03:12.590 
clean as possible what do you think
about<00:03:09.660> like<00:03:10.100> color<00:03:11.100> theory<00:03:11.490> or<00:03:11.640> like<00:03:12.000> ideas<00:03:12.420> of

00:03:12.590 --> 00:03:12.600 
about like color theory or like ideas of

00:03:12.600 --> 00:03:14.030 
about like color theory or like ideas of
color<00:03:12.840> no<00:03:13.050> can<00:03:13.230> you<00:03:13.260> paint<00:03:13.530> like<00:03:13.740> is<00:03:13.860> there<00:03:14.010> a

00:03:14.030 --> 00:03:14.040 
color no can you paint like is there a

00:03:14.040 --> 00:03:15.710 
color no can you paint like is there a
certain<00:03:14.310> spectrum<00:03:14.880> you<00:03:15.000> look<00:03:15.180> really<00:03:15.510> forward

00:03:15.710 --> 00:03:15.720 
certain spectrum you look really forward

00:03:15.720 --> 00:03:18.680 
certain spectrum you look really forward
I<00:03:16.110> tend<00:03:16.800> to<00:03:16.830> fall<00:03:17.010> into<00:03:17.430> patterns<00:03:17.940> and<00:03:18.450> and<00:03:18.570> of

00:03:18.680 --> 00:03:18.690 
I tend to fall into patterns and and of

00:03:18.690 --> 00:03:20.060 
I tend to fall into patterns and and of
using<00:03:18.930> the<00:03:18.990> same<00:03:19.170> color<00:03:19.410> schemes<00:03:19.710> over<00:03:19.860> and

00:03:20.060 --> 00:03:20.070 
using the same color schemes over and

00:03:20.070 --> 00:03:21.350 
using the same color schemes over and
over<00:03:20.220> again<00:03:20.310> and<00:03:20.520> I<00:03:20.610> think<00:03:20.820> a<00:03:20.880> lot<00:03:21.030> of<00:03:21.060> that<00:03:21.240> is

00:03:21.350 --> 00:03:21.360 
over again and I think a lot of that is

00:03:21.360 --> 00:03:23.360 
over again and I think a lot of that is
just<00:03:21.570> you<00:03:22.350> know<00:03:22.440> me<00:03:22.620> being<00:03:22.860> in<00:03:22.920> a<00:03:22.980> comfort<00:03:23.340> zone

00:03:23.360 --> 00:03:23.370 
just you know me being in a comfort zone

00:03:23.370 --> 00:03:25.760 
just you know me being in a comfort zone
so<00:03:23.910> like<00:03:24.450> with<00:03:24.630> with<00:03:24.960> pieces<00:03:25.200> like<00:03:25.470> this<00:03:25.620> it

00:03:25.760 --> 00:03:25.770 
so like with with pieces like this it

00:03:25.770 --> 00:03:27.740 
so like with with pieces like this it
was<00:03:25.860> really<00:03:25.890> great<00:03:26.160> sometimes<00:03:26.400> have<00:03:27.150> one<00:03:27.330> 7-9

was really great sometimes have one 7-9

just falling into the same routine he's

00:03:41.160 --> 00:03:43.310 
just falling into the same routine he's
not<00:03:41.430> always<00:03:41.670> great<00:03:42.030> but<00:03:43.020> in<00:03:43.170> this

00:03:43.310 --> 00:03:43.320 
not always great but in this
