there<00:01:38.450> because<00:01:38.659> my<00:01:39.020> volume<00:01:39.280> doesn't

00:01:40.270 --> 00:01:40.280 
there because my volume doesn't

00:01:40.280 --> 00:01:43.420

necessarily pick up good volume if that

00:01:43.430 --> 00:01:46.510 
necessarily pick up good volume if that
makes<00:01:43.610> any<00:01:43.700> sense<00:01:43.840> it<00:01:44.840> basically<00:01:45.020> sucks<00:01:45.520> so

00:01:46.510 --> 00:01:46.520 
makes any sense it basically sucks so

00:01:46.520 --> 00:01:49.200
