00:01:06.530 --> 00:01:06.540 
speed down from fiber optic to copper

00:01:06.540 --> 00:01:09.050 
speed down from fiber optic to copper
broadband<00:01:07.070> now<00:01:08.070> copper<00:01:08.490> broadband<00:01:08.909> ease

00:01:09.050 --> 00:01:09.060 
broadband now copper broadband ease

00:01:09.060 --> 00:01:11.780 
broadband now copper broadband ease
considerably<00:01:09.840> lower<00:01:10.140> than<00:01:10.320> fiber<00:01:11.159> optic<00:01:11.580> and

00:01:11.780 --> 00:01:11.790 
considerably lower than fiber optic and

00:01:11.790 --> 00:01:13.280 
considerably lower than fiber optic and
i<00:01:11.850> wanted<00:01:12.119> to<00:01:12.150> do<00:01:12.330> it<00:01:12.450> to<00:01:12.570> see<00:01:12.689> what<00:01:12.840> the<00:01:12.960> gaming

00:01:19.999 --> 00:01:20.009 
lot better it really was it was smooth I

00:01:20.009 --> 00:01:22.010 
lot better it really was it was smooth I

we all know that if your internet a
little<00:01:23.939> bit<00:01:24.030> worse<00:01:24.180> you<00:01:24.390> get<00:01:24.540> home<00:01:24.750> you<00:01:25.080> get

00:01:25.219 --> 00:01:25.229 
little bit worse you get home you get

00:01:25.229 --> 00:01:26.899 
little bit worse you get home you get
rewarded<00:01:25.380> a<00:01:25.710> bit<00:01:25.830> more<00:01:26.009> so<00:01:26.159> that's<00:01:26.340> fine<00:01:26.549> and<00:01:26.820> I

00:01:26.899 --> 00:01:26.909 
rewarded a bit more so that's fine and I

00:01:26.909 --> 00:01:28.670 
rewarded a bit more so that's fine and I
was<00:01:26.939> happy<00:01:27.270> with<00:01:27.360> that<00:01:27.509> any<00:01:28.080> problem<00:01:28.470> was<00:01:28.650> that

00:01:28.670 --> 00:01:28.680 
was happy with that any problem was that

00:01:28.680 --> 00:01:30.620 
was happy with that any problem was that
I<00:01:29.040> couldn't<00:01:29.100> live<00:01:29.579> stream<00:01:29.880> because<00:01:30.180> my<00:01:30.360> upload

00:01:30.620 --> 00:01:30.630 
I couldn't live stream because my upload

00:01:30.630 --> 00:01:32.749 
I couldn't live stream because my upload
speeds<00:01:31.020> were<00:01:31.290> a<00:01:31.320> little<00:01:31.560> bit<00:01:31.770> tainted<00:01:32.340> I

00:01:32.749 --> 00:01:32.759 
speeds were a little bit tainted I

00:01:32.759 --> 00:01:35.300 
speeds were a little bit tainted I
suppose<00:01:33.030> is<00:01:33.329> the<00:01:33.570> best<00:01:33.840> expression<00:01:34.799> I<00:01:34.979> can<00:01:35.159> use

00:01:35.300 --> 00:01:35.310 
suppose is the best expression I can use

00:01:35.310 --> 00:01:37.429 
suppose is the best expression I can use
for<00:01:35.460> that<00:01:35.610> so<00:01:35.939> it<00:01:36.570> was<00:01:36.780> it's<00:01:37.170> a<00:01:37.229> bit<00:01:37.320> of<00:01:37.380> a

00:01:37.429 --> 00:01:37.439 
for that so it was it's a bit of a

00:01:37.439 --> 00:01:38.840 
for that so it was it's a bit of a
double-edged<00:01:37.799> sword<00:01:37.829> you<00:01:38.310> know<00:01:38.430> in<00:01:38.579> the<00:01:38.700> one
