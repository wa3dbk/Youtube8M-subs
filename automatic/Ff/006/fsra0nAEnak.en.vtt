the<00:01:30.880> wall<00:01:31.119> so<00:01:31.420> that's<00:01:31.689> the<00:01:31.990> goal<00:01:32.200> typically

00:01:32.910 --> 00:01:32.920 
the wall so that's the goal typically

00:01:32.920 --> 00:01:34.560 
the wall so that's the goal typically
when<00:01:33.100> you<00:01:33.220> do<00:01:33.490> this<00:01:33.670> in<00:01:33.880> the<00:01:33.970> beginning<00:01:34.330> the

00:01:34.560 --> 00:01:34.570 
when you do this in the beginning the

00:01:34.570 --> 00:01:36.749 
when you do this in the beginning the
first<00:01:34.600> thing<00:01:35.049> you<00:01:35.200> do<00:01:35.350> is<00:01:35.560> this<00:01:35.890> and<00:01:36.159> then<00:01:36.490> try

00:01:36.749 --> 00:01:36.759 
first thing you do is this and then try

00:01:36.759 --> 00:01:39.450 
first thing you do is this and then try
to<00:01:36.790> go<00:01:37.030> down<00:01:37.299> it's<00:01:38.110> actually<00:01:38.350> harder<00:01:39.159> than<00:01:39.189> it

00:01:39.450 --> 00:01:39.460 
to go down it's actually harder than it

00:01:39.460 --> 00:01:40.710 
to go down it's actually harder than it
looks<00:01:39.729> and<00:01:39.909> it<00:01:40.030> kind<00:01:40.270> of<00:01:40.330> gives<00:01:40.540> you<00:01:40.600> the

00:01:40.710 --> 00:01:40.720 
looks and it kind of gives you the

00:01:40.720 --> 00:01:42.120 
looks and it kind of gives you the
feeling<00:01:40.990> with<00:01:41.290> you<00:01:41.439> maybe<00:01:41.650> you're<00:01:41.860> going<00:01:42.040> to

00:01:42.120 --> 00:01:42.130 
feeling with you maybe you're going to

feeling with you maybe you're going to
fall<00:01:42.430> back<00:01:42.729> so<00:01:43.030> take<00:01:43.270> it<00:01:43.450> slowly<00:01:43.840> but<00:01:44.829> like<00:01:45.100> I

00:01:45.270 --> 00:01:45.280 
fall back so take it slowly but like I

00:01:59.920 --> 00:02:03.330 
aren't touching and then come back up so
I<00:02:00.610> would<00:02:00.909> say<00:02:01.090> to<00:02:01.149> do<00:02:01.450> about<00:02:01.720> 10<00:02:02.140> to<00:02:02.350> 12<00:02:02.680> reps<00:02:02.799> of

00:02:03.330 --> 00:02:03.340 
I would say to do about 10 to 12 reps of

00:02:03.340 --> 00:02:03.899 
I would say to do about 10 to 12 reps of
those

00:02:03.899 --> 00:02:03.909 
those

00:02:03.909 --> 00:02:06.540 
those
and<00:02:04.030> then<00:02:04.659> you<00:02:04.810> can<00:02:05.020> go<00:02:05.230> through<00:02:05.620> three<00:02:06.220> times

00:02:06.540 --> 00:02:06.550 
and then you can go through three times

00:02:06.550 --> 00:02:09.450 
and then you can go through three times
maybe<00:02:06.850> even<00:02:07.180> three<00:02:07.510> sets<00:02:07.840> of<00:02:08.050> those<00:02:08.320> until<00:02:09.250> you

00:02:09.450 --> 00:02:09.460 
maybe even three sets of those until you

00:02:09.460 --> 00:02:11.250 
maybe even three sets of those until you
start<00:02:09.880> to<00:02:10.090> get<00:02:10.300> that<00:02:10.570> down<00:02:10.630> and<00:02:11.110> you're
