00:00:09.860 --> 00:00:13.339 

so<00:00:10.860> we<00:00:10.980> just<00:00:11.190> skied<00:00:11.520> out<00:00:11.670> here<00:00:12.150> just<00:00:13.019> coming

00:00:13.339 --> 00:00:13.349 
so we just skied out here just coming

00:00:13.349 --> 00:00:16.730 
so we just skied out here just coming
down<00:00:13.500> this<00:00:13.650> Ridge<00:00:14.210> got<00:00:15.210> an<00:00:15.360> enormous<00:00:15.900> collapse

00:00:16.730 --> 00:00:16.740 
down this Ridge got an enormous collapse

00:00:16.740 --> 00:00:19.370 
down this Ridge got an enormous collapse
so<00:00:17.340> we<00:00:17.400> trigger<00:00:17.670> this<00:00:17.790> thing<00:00:18.000> remotely<00:00:18.380> looks

00:00:19.370 --> 00:00:19.380 
so we trigger this thing remotely looks

00:00:19.380 --> 00:00:24.470 
so we trigger this thing remotely looks
like<00:00:19.560> a<00:00:19.590> broke<00:00:19.950> anywhere<00:00:20.400> from<00:00:20.640> 0<00:00:22.880> 3<00:00:23.880> to<00:00:24.000> 5<00:00:24.210> feet

00:00:24.470 --> 00:00:24.480 
like a broke anywhere from 0 3 to 5 feet

00:00:24.480 --> 00:00:26.599 
like a broke anywhere from 0 3 to 5 feet
deep<00:00:24.750> it's<00:00:25.140> a<00:00:25.230> hard<00:00:25.500> slab<00:00:25.859> this<00:00:26.130> area<00:00:26.369> gets

00:00:26.599 --> 00:00:26.609 
deep it's a hard slab this area gets

00:00:26.609 --> 00:00:29.560 
deep it's a hard slab this area gets
wind<00:00:26.880> loaded<00:00:27.269> and<00:00:27.570> it<00:00:28.230> broke<00:00:28.410> at<00:00:28.560> the<00:00:28.590> ground

00:00:29.560 --> 00:00:29.570 
wind loaded and it broke at the ground

00:00:29.570 --> 00:00:33.560 
wind loaded and it broke at the ground
and<00:00:30.570> ran<00:00:31.500> full<00:00:31.890> path<00:00:32.189> looks<00:00:33.059> like<00:00:33.239> it<00:00:33.390> got<00:00:33.510> a

00:00:33.560 --> 00:00:33.570 
and ran full path looks like it got a

00:00:33.570 --> 00:00:38.119 
and ran full path looks like it got a
few<00:00:33.809> trees<00:00:35.089> so<00:00:36.089> it's<00:00:36.269> quite<00:00:37.080> significant<00:00:37.830> and

00:00:38.119 --> 00:00:38.129 
few trees so it's quite significant and

00:00:38.129 --> 00:00:42.649 
few trees so it's quite significant and
also<00:00:38.489> quite<00:00:38.760> unstable<00:00:41.059> up<00:00:42.059> here<00:00:42.330> in<00:00:42.390> Taylor

00:00:42.649 --> 00:00:42.659 
also quite unstable up here in Taylor

00:00:42.659 --> 00:00:45.310 
also quite unstable up here in Taylor
fork<00:00:42.989> actually<00:00:43.830> the<00:00:43.979> edge<00:00:44.100> of<00:00:44.280> sunlight<00:00:44.729> basin

00:00:45.310 --> 00:00:45.320 
fork actually the edge of sunlight basin

00:00:45.320 --> 00:00:50.930 
fork actually the edge of sunlight basin
and<00:00:47.449> this<00:00:48.449> Avalanche<00:00:48.960> we<00:00:49.140> triggered<00:00:49.940> was

00:00:50.930 --> 00:00:50.940 
and this Avalanche we triggered was

00:00:50.940 --> 00:00:56.810 
and this Avalanche we triggered was
remotely<00:00:51.269> quite<00:00:51.989> a<00:00:52.019> distance<00:00:52.830> away<00:00:55.519> in<00:00:56.519> the

00:00:56.810 --> 00:00:56.820 
remotely quite a distance away in the

00:00:56.820 --> 00:00:58.939 
remotely quite a distance away in the
pillow<00:00:57.000> benevolence<00:00:57.479> morning<00:00:57.839> we're<00:00:58.680> seeing

00:00:58.939 --> 00:00:58.949 
pillow benevolence morning we're seeing

00:00:58.949 --> 00:01:01.160 
pillow benevolence morning we're seeing
lots<00:00:59.220> of<00:00:59.400> natural<00:00:59.580> Avalanche<00:00:59.820> activity<00:01:00.210> as

00:01:01.160 --> 00:01:01.170 
lots of natural Avalanche activity as

00:01:01.170 --> 00:01:05.149 
lots of natural Avalanche activity as
well<00:01:01.229> as<00:01:01.650> people's<00:01:02.600> eyes<00:01:03.600> rolling<00:01:04.110> so<00:01:04.830> it's

00:01:05.149 --> 00:01:05.159 
well as people's eyes rolling so it's

00:01:05.159 --> 00:01:07.910 
well as people's eyes rolling so it's
really<00:01:05.460> dangerous<00:01:05.850> time<00:01:06.479> the<00:01:07.229> reason<00:01:07.710> it's<00:01:07.830> so

00:01:07.910 --> 00:01:07.920 
really dangerous time the reason it's so

00:01:07.920 --> 00:01:10.400 
really dangerous time the reason it's so
dangerous<00:01:08.160> is<00:01:08.790> this<00:01:08.940> area<00:01:09.270> got<00:01:09.600> a<00:01:09.630> ton<00:01:10.140> of<00:01:10.170> snow

00:01:10.400 --> 00:01:10.410 
dangerous is this area got a ton of snow

00:01:10.410 --> 00:01:12.110 
dangerous is this area got a ton of snow
got<00:01:10.770> like<00:01:10.920> five<00:01:11.130> inches<00:01:11.370> of<00:01:11.640> water<00:01:11.820> in<00:01:11.970> the

00:01:12.110 --> 00:01:12.120 
got like five inches of water in the

00:01:12.120 --> 00:01:14.540 
got like five inches of water in the
last<00:01:12.300> seven<00:01:12.630> days<00:01:12.810> and<00:01:13.500> then<00:01:13.890> snow<00:01:14.190> is<00:01:14.340> falling

00:01:14.540 --> 00:01:14.550 
last seven days and then snow is falling

00:01:14.550 --> 00:01:17.380 
last seven days and then snow is falling
on<00:01:14.850> extreme<00:01:15.240> moving<00:01:15.570> so<00:01:15.810> pack<00:01:16.110> the<00:01:16.770> ground

00:01:17.380 --> 00:01:17.390 
on extreme moving so pack the ground

00:01:17.390 --> 00:01:20.960 
on extreme moving so pack the ground
most<00:01:18.390> of<00:01:19.190> Montana<00:01:20.190> especially<00:01:20.790> down<00:01:20.940> here

00:01:20.960 --> 00:01:20.970 
most of Montana especially down here

00:01:20.970 --> 00:01:23.600 
most of Montana especially down here
we've<00:01:21.750> got<00:01:21.780> faceted<00:01:22.710> snow<00:01:22.980> which<00:01:23.280> is<00:01:23.400> really

00:01:23.600 --> 00:01:23.610 
we've got faceted snow which is really

00:01:23.610 --> 00:01:26.900 
we've got faceted snow which is really
weak<00:01:23.850> and<00:01:24.150> can't<00:01:24.330> so<00:01:25.220> that's<00:01:26.220> what<00:01:26.430> happened

00:01:26.900 --> 00:01:26.910 
weak and can't so that's what happened

00:01:26.910 --> 00:01:28.340 
weak and can't so that's what happened
and<00:01:27.000> I<00:01:27.060> anticipate<00:01:27.360> it's<00:01:27.870> gonna<00:01:28.020> take<00:01:28.320> a

00:01:28.340 --> 00:01:28.350 
and I anticipate it's gonna take a

00:01:28.350 --> 00:01:47.810 
and I anticipate it's gonna take a
little<00:01:28.530> bit<00:01:28.710> of<00:01:28.770> time<00:01:28.950> for<00:01:29.010> this<00:01:29.310> stuff<00:01:46.820> when

00:01:47.810 --> 00:01:47.820 
little bit of time for this stuff when

00:01:47.820 --> 00:01:51.140 
little bit of time for this stuff when
we<00:01:47.850> skin<00:01:48.270> back<00:01:48.479> up<00:01:48.690> the<00:01:48.840> ridge<00:01:49.520> we<00:01:50.520> saw<00:01:50.820> that

00:01:51.140 --> 00:01:51.150 
we skin back up the ridge we saw that

00:01:51.150 --> 00:01:54.500 
we skin back up the ridge we saw that
the<00:01:51.620> collapse<00:01:52.620> we<00:01:52.920> had<00:01:53.159> actually<00:01:53.510> propagated

00:01:54.500 --> 00:01:54.510 
the collapse we had actually propagated

00:01:54.510 --> 00:01:57.530 
the collapse we had actually propagated
a<00:01:54.690> lot<00:01:55.350> farther<00:01:55.650> than<00:01:55.890> just<00:01:56.250> the<00:01:56.370> Avalanche<00:01:56.850> we

00:01:57.530 --> 00:01:57.540 
a lot farther than just the Avalanche we

00:01:57.540 --> 00:01:59.240 
a lot farther than just the Avalanche we
saw<00:01:57.780> there<00:01:58.020> on<00:01:58.170> that<00:01:58.350> on<00:01:58.560> north<00:01:58.830> east<00:01:59.040> facing

00:01:59.240 --> 00:01:59.250 
saw there on that on north east facing

00:01:59.250 --> 00:02:03.260 
saw there on that on north east facing
hill<00:01:59.610> it<00:02:00.390> also<00:02:00.750> propagated<00:02:01.740> behind<00:02:02.700> us<00:02:02.940> on<00:02:03.120> the

00:02:03.260 --> 00:02:03.270 
hill it also propagated behind us on the

00:02:03.270 --> 00:02:06.289 
hill it also propagated behind us on the
ridge<00:02:03.479> and<00:02:04.159> probably<00:02:05.159> took<00:02:05.460> out<00:02:05.700> close<00:02:06.090> to

00:02:06.289 --> 00:02:06.299 
ridge and probably took out close to

00:02:06.299 --> 00:02:10.340 
ridge and probably took out close to
another<00:02:07.099> thousand<00:02:08.099> feet
