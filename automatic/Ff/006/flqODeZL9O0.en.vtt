the<00:00:22.439> coaching<00:00:22.859> series<00:00:23.189> of<00:00:23.490> boots<00:00:23.609> was<00:00:24.000> a<00:00:24.029> fleet

00:00:24.590 --> 00:00:24.600 
the coaching series of boots was a fleet

00:00:24.600 --> 00:00:27.259 
the coaching series of boots was a fleet
inspired<00:00:25.080> and<00:00:25.410> our<00:00:25.619> athletes<00:00:26.130> came<00:00:26.340> to<00:00:26.550> us<00:00:26.699> the

00:00:29.359 --> 00:00:29.369 
guys that were skiing big lines these

00:00:29.369 --> 00:00:31.939 
guys that were skiing big lines these
guys<00:00:29.550> were<00:00:29.789> typically<00:00:30.210> skiing<00:00:30.599> 150<00:00:31.380> race<00:00:31.619> plug

00:00:31.949 --> 00:00:33.500 
guys were typically skiing 150 race plug
boots<00:00:32.250> because<00:00:32.790> they<00:00:33.000> needed<00:00:33.420> the

00:00:33.500 --> 00:00:33.510 
boots because they needed the

00:00:33.510 --> 00:00:36.410 
boots because they needed the
performance<00:00:34.079> of<00:00:34.170> a<00:00:34.290> boot<00:00:34.610> for<00:00:35.610> those<00:00:35.940> really

00:00:36.410 --> 00:00:36.420 
performance of a boot for those really

00:00:36.420 --> 00:00:39.920 
performance of a boot for those really
extreme<00:00:37.260> hard<00:00:37.649> lines<00:00:37.980> but<00:00:38.579> they<00:00:39.270> also<00:00:39.450> wanted

00:00:39.920 --> 00:00:39.930 
extreme hard lines but they also wanted

00:00:39.930 --> 00:00:43.010 
extreme hard lines but they also wanted
some<00:00:40.379> versatility<00:00:41.160> to<00:00:41.399> hike<00:00:41.879> out<00:00:42.120> or<00:00:42.420> hike

00:00:43.010 --> 00:00:43.020 
some versatility to hike out or hike

00:00:43.020 --> 00:00:45.290 
some versatility to hike out or hike
over<00:00:43.379> to<00:00:43.530> get<00:00:43.649> into<00:00:44.010> a<00:00:44.040> stream<00:00:44.579> so<00:00:44.850> they<00:00:44.969> wanted

00:00:45.290 --> 00:00:45.300 
over to get into a stream so they wanted

00:00:45.300 --> 00:00:47.090 
over to get into a stream so they wanted
some<00:00:45.480> couple<00:00:45.780> mobility<00:00:46.289> but<00:00:46.710> they<00:00:46.860> really

00:00:47.090 --> 00:00:47.100 
some couple mobility but they really

00:00:47.100 --> 00:00:49.310 
some couple mobility but they really
didn't<00:00:47.460> want<00:00:47.700> to<00:00:47.789> give<00:00:47.940> up<00:00:48.320> performance

00:00:49.310 --> 00:00:49.320 
didn't want to give up performance

00:00:49.320 --> 00:00:52.189 
didn't want to give up performance
sacrifice<00:00:49.950> so<00:00:50.670> when<00:00:51.180> we<00:00:51.360> designed<00:00:51.780> the

00:00:52.189 --> 00:00:52.199 
sacrifice so when we designed the

00:00:52.199 --> 00:00:54.500 
sacrifice so when we designed the
Cochise<00:00:52.710> boot<00:00:53.039> it<00:00:53.550> was<00:00:53.699> very<00:00:53.969> important<00:00:54.449> for

00:00:54.500 --> 00:00:54.510 
Cochise boot it was very important for

00:00:54.510 --> 00:00:56.569 
Cochise boot it was very important for
us<00:00:54.750> to<00:00:54.780> have<00:00:55.020> a<00:00:55.110> strong<00:00:55.469> connection<00:00:55.770> of<00:00:56.370> the

00:00:56.569 --> 00:00:56.579 
us to have a strong connection of the

00:00:56.579 --> 00:01:00.349 
us to have a strong connection of the
lower<00:00:56.969> shell<00:00:57.649> to<00:00:58.649> the<00:00:58.859> cuff<00:00:59.100> in<00:00:59.760> a<00:00:59.879> locking

00:01:00.349 --> 00:01:00.359 
lower shell to the cuff in a locking

00:01:00.359 --> 00:01:03.529 
lower shell to the cuff in a locking
mechanism<00:01:00.390> and<00:01:01.260> we<00:01:02.070> have<00:01:02.190> an<00:01:02.340> e<00:01:02.550> feature<00:01:03.149> where

00:01:03.529 --> 00:01:03.539 
mechanism and we have an e feature where

00:01:03.539 --> 00:01:05.660 
mechanism and we have an e feature where
we<00:01:04.049> have<00:01:04.170> a<00:01:04.199> metal<00:01:04.500> plate<00:01:04.739> that's<00:01:05.070> mounted<00:01:05.519> to

00:01:05.660 --> 00:01:05.670 
we have a metal plate that's mounted to

00:01:05.670 --> 00:01:08.179 
we have a metal plate that's mounted to
the<00:01:05.700> lower<00:01:06.000> shell<00:01:06.390> in<00:01:06.630> for<00:01:07.140> contact<00:01:07.740> points

00:01:08.179 --> 00:01:08.189 
the lower shell in for contact points

00:01:08.189 --> 00:01:10.429 
the lower shell in for contact points
and<00:01:08.369> then<00:01:08.970> we<00:01:09.150> have<00:01:09.299> a<00:01:09.479> metal<00:01:09.780> connection<00:01:10.320> in

00:01:10.429 --> 00:01:10.439 
and then we have a metal connection in

00:01:10.439 --> 00:01:12.560 
and then we have a metal connection in
the<00:01:10.470> cup<00:01:10.799> so<00:01:11.430> when<00:01:11.520> you<00:01:11.610> put<00:01:11.790> this<00:01:12.000> boot<00:01:12.270> in<00:01:12.450> the

00:01:12.560 --> 00:01:12.570 
the cup so when you put this boot in the

00:01:12.570 --> 00:01:14.520 
the cup so when you put this boot in the
ski<00:01:12.840> mode

00:01:14.520 --> 00:01:14.530 
ski mode

00:01:14.530 --> 00:01:16.980

oops<00:01:14.950> flux<00:01:15.729> that<00:01:15.880> in<00:01:16.090> that<00:01:16.570> you're<00:01:16.750> locking

00:01:16.980 --> 00:01:16.990 
oops flux that in that you're locking

00:01:16.990 --> 00:01:19.230 
oops flux that in that you're locking
metal<00:01:17.590> to<00:01:17.799> metal<00:01:17.920> connection<00:01:18.580> that<00:01:18.909> gives<00:01:19.119> a

00:01:19.230 --> 00:01:19.240 
metal to metal connection that gives a

00:01:19.240 --> 00:01:21.930 
metal to metal connection that gives a
very<00:01:19.450> strong<00:01:19.930> flux<00:01:20.440> characteristic<00:01:21.310> first

00:01:21.930 --> 00:01:21.940 
very strong flux characteristic first

00:01:21.940 --> 00:01:24.749 
very strong flux characteristic first
and<00:01:22.150> foremost<00:01:22.619> secondly<00:01:23.619> they<00:01:24.280> wanted<00:01:24.670> the

00:01:24.749 --> 00:01:24.759 
and foremost secondly they wanted the

00:01:24.759 --> 00:01:26.670 
and foremost secondly they wanted the
boot<00:01:24.940> to<00:01:24.970> be<00:01:25.210> lightweight<00:01:25.540> we<00:01:26.049> developed<00:01:26.500> a

00:01:26.670 --> 00:01:26.680 
boot to be lightweight we developed a

00:01:26.680 --> 00:01:28.710 
boot to be lightweight we developed a
plastic<00:01:27.400> called<00:01:27.549> tracks<00:01:28.000> that's<00:01:28.299> twenty

00:01:28.710 --> 00:01:28.720 
plastic called tracks that's twenty

00:01:28.720 --> 00:01:32.430 
plastic called tracks that's twenty
percent<00:01:29.080> lighter<00:01:29.520> than<00:01:30.520> a<00:01:30.909> typical<00:01:31.240> tup<00:01:32.110> boot

00:01:32.430 --> 00:01:32.440 
percent lighter than a typical tup boot

00:01:32.440 --> 00:01:34.859

we've<00:01:49.270> also<00:01:49.479> created<00:01:49.990> a<00:01:50.530> interchangeable<00:01:51.460> Sol

00:01:51.719 --> 00:01:51.729 
we've also created a interchangeable Sol

00:01:51.729 --> 00:01:53.910 
we've also created a interchangeable Sol
system<00:01:52.060> that<00:01:52.780> allows<00:01:52.990> them<00:01:53.200> to<00:01:53.229> google<00:01:53.590> from<00:01:53.830> a
