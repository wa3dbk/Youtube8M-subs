00:00:02.900 --> 00:00:08.980
 and a really good year were 

00:00:06.670 --> 00:00:12.559
 seven world championship races 

00:00:08.980 --> 00:00:15.830
 six of the america championship and good 

00:00:12.559 --> 00:00:18.260
 then runner-up and champion, so what 

00:00:15.830 --> 00:00:21.320
 better year that closed than close it 

00:00:18.260 --> 00:00:23.449
 this way and good again I had the 

00:00:21.320 --> 00:00:24.640
 pleasure of being invited to the gala of the 

00:00:23.449 --> 00:00:27.880
 fia 

00:00:24.640 --> 00:00:30.849
 and good is my third time that is said 

00:00:27.880 --> 00:00:34.600
 easy but the truth is that it's all a 

00:00:30.849 --> 00:00:38.670
 success and I feel very honored not any 

00:00:34.600 --> 00:00:44.290
 Mexican has still achieved this and good 

00:00:38.670 --> 00:00:46.900
 will be like ambassador of mexico because you 

00:00:44.290 --> 00:00:49.390
 full of pride when I when 

00:00:46.900 --> 00:00:52.659
 things come out right the truth is that 

00:00:49.390 --> 00:00:54.309
 it's not easy many times you feel like it 

00:00:52.659 --> 00:00:57.070
 of even throwing in the towel because 

00:00:54.309 --> 00:00:59.710
 suddenly you accumulate so much is much 

00:00:57.070 --> 00:01:02.649
 tension and apart because you also have to 

00:00:59.710 --> 00:01:04.570
 to be physically perfect and that I have 

00:01:02.649 --> 00:01:07.149
 proven in recent years 

00:01:04.570 --> 00:01:09.009
 if you're not physically well in the 

00:01:07.149 --> 00:01:12.100
 race you're not good you do not concentrate 

00:01:09.009 --> 00:01:14.400
 same flaws in the curves then it's 

00:01:12.100 --> 00:01:18.170
 a whole set 

00:01:14.400 --> 00:01:21.229
 to be one physically well 

00:01:18.170 --> 00:01:23.720
 also watch the part with the mechanics 

00:01:21.229 --> 00:01:27.490
 that the car is perfect we are very 

00:01:23.720 --> 00:01:31.610
 good do not leave us normal well we are 

00:01:27.490 --> 00:01:35.240
 competitors already born or we do not like 

00:01:31.610 --> 00:01:36.920
 I fought when I left when I started 

00:01:35.240 --> 00:01:39.619
 with the rallies that was in the year 

00:01:36.920 --> 00:01:43.729
 2000 criticized there really was nothing like that 

00:01:39.619 --> 00:01:48.409
 it was a really unknown sport more 

00:01:43.729 --> 00:01:50.509
 European or South American here almost not 

00:01:48.409 --> 00:01:52.130
 there was culture of what the rallies were 

00:01:50.509 --> 00:01:55.009
 now we have a championship date 

00:01:52.130 --> 00:01:57.679
 global and good more and more people have 

00:01:55.009 --> 00:02:00.289
 I remember the first rally that six are 

00:01:57.679 --> 00:02:02.420
 mexico will have gone three thousand people and 

00:02:00.289 --> 00:02:04.690
 now more than 200,000 people go to 

00:02:02.420 --> 00:02:04.690
 see him
