00:00:01.340 --> 00:00:04.100 

this<00:00:02.340> is<00:00:02.520> an<00:00:02.639> introduction<00:00:03.120> to<00:00:03.449> the<00:00:03.540> fire<00:00:03.810> bow

00:00:04.100 --> 00:00:04.110 
this is an introduction to the fire bow

00:00:04.110 --> 00:00:08.509 
this is an introduction to the fire bow
making<00:00:04.980> fire<00:00:05.400> by<00:00:05.759> friction<00:00:07.220> so<00:00:08.220> here<00:00:08.370> we've

00:00:08.509 --> 00:00:08.519 
making fire by friction so here we've

00:00:08.519 --> 00:00:11.600 
making fire by friction so here we've
got<00:00:08.550> the<00:00:08.820> half<00:00:08.970> board<00:00:10.070> with<00:00:11.070> sockets<00:00:11.519> that

00:00:11.600 --> 00:00:11.610 
got the half board with sockets that

00:00:11.610 --> 00:00:13.749 
got the half board with sockets that
we've<00:00:11.910> already<00:00:12.120> drilled<00:00:12.780> and<00:00:12.990> worked<00:00:13.200> in<00:00:13.500> and

00:00:13.749 --> 00:00:13.759 
we've already drilled and worked in and

00:00:13.759 --> 00:00:18.140 
we've already drilled and worked in and
a<00:00:14.759> notch<00:00:15.059> that<00:00:15.990> lets<00:00:16.230> the<00:00:16.550> that's<00:00:17.550> the<00:00:17.760> dust

00:00:18.140 --> 00:00:18.150 
a notch that lets the that's the dust

00:00:18.150 --> 00:00:21.320 
a notch that lets the that's the dust
from<00:00:18.330> the<00:00:18.510> wood<00:00:18.690> in<00:00:18.900> the<00:00:19.020> Ember<00:00:19.320> form<00:00:20.330> you've

00:00:21.320 --> 00:00:21.330 
from the wood in the Ember form you've

00:00:21.330 --> 00:00:23.240 
from the wood in the Ember form you've
got<00:00:21.510> the<00:00:21.600> drill<00:00:21.869> which<00:00:22.199> fits<00:00:22.500> the<00:00:22.650> socket<00:00:23.070> on

00:00:23.240 --> 00:00:23.250 
got the drill which fits the socket on

00:00:23.250 --> 00:00:26.720 
got the drill which fits the socket on
one<00:00:24.090> end<00:00:24.300> it's<00:00:24.570> going<00:00:24.750> to<00:00:24.810> be<00:00:24.930> a<00:00:25.250> bit<00:00:26.250> rounder

00:00:26.720 --> 00:00:26.730 
one end it's going to be a bit rounder

00:00:26.730 --> 00:00:29.269 
one end it's going to be a bit rounder
and<00:00:26.760> flatter<00:00:27.119> to<00:00:27.689> maximize<00:00:28.289> the<00:00:28.439> friction<00:00:28.890> and

00:00:29.269 --> 00:00:29.279 
and flatter to maximize the friction and

00:00:29.279 --> 00:00:31.189 
and flatter to maximize the friction and
on<00:00:29.400> the<00:00:29.519> other<00:00:29.640> end<00:00:29.880> our<00:00:30.150> point<00:00:30.779> that<00:00:30.990> in<00:00:31.109> a

00:00:31.189 --> 00:00:31.199 
on the other end our point that in a

00:00:31.199 --> 00:00:34.729 
on the other end our point that in a
minute<00:00:32.270> you<00:00:33.270> can<00:00:33.570> have<00:00:33.750> that<00:00:33.899> pointed<00:00:34.710> to

00:00:34.729 --> 00:00:34.739 
minute you can have that pointed to

00:00:34.739 --> 00:00:37.549 
minute you can have that pointed to
minimize<00:00:35.460> the<00:00:35.610> friction<00:00:36.110> so<00:00:37.110> that's<00:00:37.260> a<00:00:37.350> half

00:00:37.549 --> 00:00:37.559 
minimize the friction so that's a half

00:00:37.559 --> 00:00:41.119 
minimize the friction so that's a half
board<00:00:37.890> and<00:00:38.100> drill<00:00:38.340> and<00:00:39.300> this<00:00:39.600> is<00:00:39.750> the<00:00:39.870> boat<00:00:40.129> the

00:00:41.119 --> 00:00:41.129 
board and drill and this is the boat the

00:00:41.129 --> 00:00:44.150 
board and drill and this is the boat the
drill<00:00:41.430> is<00:00:41.670> wrapped<00:00:42.000> in<00:00:42.210> the<00:00:42.360> bow<00:00:42.510> and<00:00:42.829> then<00:00:43.829> you

00:00:44.150 --> 00:00:44.160 
drill is wrapped in the bow and then you

00:00:44.160 --> 00:00:53.869 
drill is wrapped in the bow and then you
use<00:00:44.399> that<00:00:44.430> to<00:00:45.140> to<00:00:46.140> go<00:00:47.010> back<00:00:47.190> and<00:00:47.370> forth<00:00:52.879> so

00:00:53.869 --> 00:00:53.879 
use that to to go back and forth so

00:00:53.879 --> 00:00:55.700 
use that to to go back and forth so
you've<00:00:54.000> got<00:00:54.030> the<00:00:54.239> half<00:00:54.420> board<00:00:54.750> the<00:00:55.199> drill<00:00:55.500> and

00:00:55.700 --> 00:00:55.710 
you've got the half board the drill and

00:00:55.710 --> 00:00:58.340 
you've got the half board the drill and
the<00:00:56.430> boat<00:00:56.640> you<00:00:57.180> see<00:00:57.390> how<00:00:57.510> I<00:00:57.539> use<00:00:57.660> the<00:00:57.989> bow<00:00:58.140> in<00:00:58.199> a

00:00:58.340 --> 00:00:58.350 
the boat you see how I use the bow in a

00:00:58.350 --> 00:01:01.130 
the boat you see how I use the bow in a
minute<00:00:58.590> and<00:00:59.070> we've<00:00:59.820> also<00:01:00.030> got<00:01:00.300> two<00:01:00.539> limpets<00:01:00.930> my

00:01:01.130 --> 00:01:01.140 
minute and we've also got two limpets my

00:01:01.140 --> 00:01:03.740 
minute and we've also got two limpets my
one<00:01:01.379> room<00:01:01.710> or<00:01:01.829> therefore<00:01:02.280> i<00:01:02.489> use<00:01:03.239> limpets

00:01:03.740 --> 00:01:03.750 
one room or therefore i use limpets

00:01:03.750 --> 00:01:06.170 
one room or therefore i use limpets
instead<00:01:04.409> of<00:01:04.439> a<00:01:04.710> wooden<00:01:05.040> bear<00:01:05.580> and<00:01:05.729> block<00:01:05.909> on

00:01:06.170 --> 00:01:06.180 
instead of a wooden bear and block on

00:01:06.180 --> 00:01:09.500 
instead of a wooden bear and block on
the<00:01:06.240> top<00:01:06.689> of<00:01:06.720> the<00:01:06.960> draft<00:01:07.170> so<00:01:07.799> so<00:01:08.580> you<00:01:09.119> have<00:01:09.270> two

00:01:09.500 --> 00:01:09.510 
the top of the draft so so you have two

00:01:09.510 --> 00:01:12.289 
the top of the draft so so you have two
limpets<00:01:09.900> and<00:01:10.140> that<00:01:10.799> gives<00:01:11.010> you<00:01:11.159> a<00:01:11.369> nice<00:01:11.610> firm

00:01:12.289 --> 00:01:12.299 
limpets and that gives you a nice firm

00:01:12.299 --> 00:01:14.480 
limpets and that gives you a nice firm
grip<00:01:12.540> down<00:01:12.840> on<00:01:13.080> the<00:01:13.200> wood<00:01:13.380> now<00:01:13.950> the<00:01:14.010> benefit<00:01:14.460> of

00:01:14.480 --> 00:01:14.490 
grip down on the wood now the benefit of

00:01:14.490 --> 00:01:17.210 
grip down on the wood now the benefit of
having<00:01:14.700> limpets<00:01:15.240> is<00:01:15.530> polished<00:01:16.530> on<00:01:16.740> the<00:01:16.860> inside

00:01:17.210 --> 00:01:17.220 
having limpets is polished on the inside

00:01:17.220 --> 00:01:19.429 
having limpets is polished on the inside
and<00:01:17.549> it<00:01:17.729> doesn't<00:01:18.000> wear<00:01:18.150> down<00:01:18.360> the<00:01:18.390> wood<00:01:18.720> drill

00:01:19.429 --> 00:01:19.439 
and it doesn't wear down the wood drill

00:01:19.439 --> 00:01:22.010 
and it doesn't wear down the wood drill
from<00:01:19.770> the<00:01:19.979> top<00:01:20.220> so<00:01:20.909> minimizes<00:01:21.540> the<00:01:21.659> friction

00:01:22.010 --> 00:01:22.020 
from the top so minimizes the friction

00:01:22.020 --> 00:01:25.219 
from the top so minimizes the friction
on<00:01:22.080> top<00:01:22.380> there<00:01:22.680> and<00:01:23.840> maximizes<00:01:24.840> it<00:01:24.990> down<00:01:25.140> the

00:01:25.219 --> 00:01:25.229 
on top there and maximizes it down the

00:01:25.229 --> 00:01:28.429 
on top there and maximizes it down the
bottom<00:01:26.330> so<00:01:27.330> limpets<00:01:27.750> or<00:01:27.900> a<00:01:27.930> great<00:01:28.110> bearing

00:01:28.429 --> 00:01:28.439 
bottom so limpets or a great bearing

00:01:28.439 --> 00:01:30.020 
bottom so limpets or a great bearing
block<00:01:28.650> and<00:01:28.920> then<00:01:29.340> of<00:01:29.490> course<00:01:29.700> you<00:01:29.850> need<00:01:29.970> the

00:01:30.020 --> 00:01:30.030 
block and then of course you need the

00:01:30.030 --> 00:01:32.090 
block and then of course you need the
tinder<00:01:30.689> bundle<00:01:30.840> this<00:01:31.290> you<00:01:31.680> need<00:01:31.860> to<00:01:32.009> have

00:01:32.090 --> 00:01:32.100 
tinder bundle this you need to have

00:01:32.100 --> 00:01:35.780 
tinder bundle this you need to have
ready<00:01:32.520> made<00:01:32.579> and<00:01:33.479> prepared<00:01:33.869> before<00:01:34.670> you<00:01:35.670> even

00:01:35.780 --> 00:01:35.790 
ready made and prepared before you even

00:01:35.790 --> 00:01:38.510 
ready made and prepared before you even
start<00:01:36.240> with<00:01:36.540> this<00:01:36.900> because<00:01:37.560> when<00:01:37.770> once<00:01:38.340> you've

00:01:38.510 --> 00:01:38.520 
start with this because when once you've

00:01:38.520 --> 00:01:40.480 
start with this because when once you've
got<00:01:38.670> your<00:01:38.700> mbar<00:01:39.180> you<00:01:39.869> need<00:01:40.049> to<00:01:40.200> carefully

got your mbar you need to carefully
transport<00:01:41.490> the<00:01:41.610> em<00:01:41.729> both<00:01:41.939> to<00:01:42.150> the<00:01:42.180> tinder

00:01:42.560 --> 00:01:42.570 
transport the em both to the tinder

00:01:42.570 --> 00:01:44.300 
transport the em both to the tinder
bundle<00:01:42.689> and<00:01:43.049> that's<00:01:43.560> what<00:01:43.799> this<00:01:43.920> piece<00:01:44.159> of

00:01:44.300 --> 00:01:44.310 
bundle and that's what this piece of

00:01:44.310 --> 00:01:47.030 
bundle and that's what this piece of
bark<00:01:44.520> is<00:01:44.759> for<00:01:45.090> so<00:01:45.810> you<00:01:45.869> do<00:01:46.140> your<00:01:46.290> work<00:01:46.500> on<00:01:46.770> to

00:01:47.030 --> 00:01:47.040 
bark is for so you do your work on to
