00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.790
 hey people are improving in the camera 

00:00:12.469 --> 00:00:16.980
 right now because it is at 

00:00:15.780 --> 00:00:18.690
 my board what in any case so on 

00:00:16.980 --> 00:00:20.369
 At the beginning the dear goat squeals 

00:00:18.690 --> 00:00:22.769
 considering that the axes have 

00:00:20.369 --> 00:00:30.420
 got the hat and we'll show you 

00:00:22.769 --> 00:00:32.700
 how to do that with the quiz 

00:00:30.420 --> 00:00:35.790
 actually the most new one offered the 

00:00:32.700 --> 00:00:39.989
 case probably does not need that 

00:00:35.790 --> 00:00:42.270
 completely out of this leather then there 

00:00:39.989 --> 00:00:44.160
 is it this thing that is so to speak 

00:00:42.270 --> 00:00:46.260
 a plastic anchoring in there this 

00:00:44.160 --> 00:00:47.789
 Now knows and that is the axis and the 

00:00:46.260 --> 00:00:49.379
 is in it, so to speak , and if you are 

00:00:47.789 --> 00:00:51.180
 which then moves to keep his creatures 

00:00:49.379 --> 00:00:53.809
 and if so we have gone 

00:00:51.180 --> 00:00:53.809
 you have to say that 

00:00:54.610 --> 00:00:59.420
 he can either be retracted 

00:00:57.430 --> 00:01:02.390
 let go if you bet 

00:00:59.420 --> 00:01:05.180
 then companion and eventually think away 

00:01:02.390 --> 00:01:09.430
 I actually do it but man 

00:01:05.180 --> 00:01:09.430
 it can be synonymous if the word 

00:01:10.719 --> 00:01:16.820
 and now what we need first of all 

00:01:15.140 --> 00:01:19.780
 time you need a spurned 

00:01:16.820 --> 00:01:19.780
 any kind of 

00:01:19.969 --> 00:01:26.990
 because the third also for skin cancer 

00:01:24.350 --> 00:01:30.939
 easy in any supermarket anyway 

00:01:26.990 --> 00:01:30.939
 you can buy so I now 

00:01:37.479 --> 00:01:42.610
 we'll show you now is just the same 

00:01:39.979 --> 00:01:45.020
 theme done welcome the axes 

00:01:42.610 --> 00:01:46.819
 Now we show how to do that 

00:01:45.020 --> 00:01:49.209
 So we first screw this mass 

00:01:46.819 --> 00:01:49.209
 on 

00:01:59.310 --> 00:02:03.479
 so we would have had to come up with that 

00:02:01.860 --> 00:02:05.130
 and then you can just that, so to speak 

00:02:03.479 --> 00:02:09.420
 Just turn it out then you have 

00:02:05.130 --> 00:02:18.989
 this one then has the thing in the 

00:02:09.420 --> 00:02:23.190
 hand gravestone this is about this 

00:02:18.989 --> 00:02:27.590
 But the winner of this happens 

00:02:23.190 --> 00:02:27.590
 right there would have to click now 

00:02:28.970 --> 00:02:33.630
 it takes your knife or something 

00:02:31.319 --> 00:02:35.130
 always he has and the core is from 

00:02:33.630 --> 00:02:36.209
 then you just go in this one 

00:02:35.130 --> 00:02:39.049
 this hole just a bit 

00:02:36.209 --> 00:02:39.049
 pure soap 

00:02:45.030 --> 00:02:50.730
 and you can then next as well 

00:02:47.190 --> 00:02:53.370
 Here he is literate in this 

00:02:50.730 --> 00:02:59.069
 still in there you can say so synonymous 

00:02:53.370 --> 00:03:01.739
 Again, one collides 

00:02:59.069 --> 00:03:04.250
 Kernseife once again really a 

00:03:01.739 --> 00:03:05.960
 made a little wine 

00:03:04.250 --> 00:03:07.670
 and actually you should if you can 

00:03:05.960 --> 00:03:09.860
 After that it should be complete 

00:03:07.670 --> 00:03:11.330
 stopped squealing but none 

00:03:09.860 --> 00:03:12.470
 experience exactly 

00:03:11.330 --> 00:03:14.690
 otherwise you have to stop it a bit 

00:03:12.470 --> 00:03:16.360
 retract and then not features 

00:03:14.690 --> 00:03:20.980
 then you can do that here again 

00:03:16.360 --> 00:03:20.980
 at this summit here 

00:03:22.720 --> 00:03:30.490
 are you doing it and then he does 

00:03:27.650 --> 00:03:30.490
 Just put it back in here 

00:03:30.610 --> 00:03:35.630
 so it is on it again and then 

00:03:33.440 --> 00:03:41.210
 simply will just build again 

00:03:35.630 --> 00:03:47.120
 Dismantled like that and the screw from it 

00:03:41.210 --> 00:03:48.770
 could then turn tight and 

00:03:47.120 --> 00:03:50.570
 The same thing makes it so like 

00:03:48.770 --> 00:03:53.860
 many how solid you wanted to have that 

00:03:50.570 --> 00:03:53.860
 namely, look again 

00:04:33.010 --> 00:04:40.840
 so now I have that slower again 

00:04:35.390 --> 00:04:42.410
 so not necessarily now 

00:04:40.840 --> 00:04:45.880
 be accurate 

00:04:42.410 --> 00:04:45.880
 the skv tap 

00:04:50.030 --> 00:05:00.570
 with the worries 

00:04:53.150 --> 00:05:04.080
 that would be the knock 

00:05:00.570 --> 00:05:04.080
 the discussion 

00:05:07.620 --> 00:05:12.550
 move 

00:05:09.389 --> 00:05:20.970
 you do not sound so friendly anymore 

00:05:12.550 --> 00:05:23.560
 second now but if that is compact 

00:05:20.970 --> 00:05:26.610
 who is going to eliminate it now or urgently 

00:05:23.560 --> 00:05:26.610
 it just lasts now 

00:05:47.259 --> 00:05:57.289
 align exactly and horny now 

00:05:51.470 --> 00:05:59.349
 the axis also good that was now the 

00:05:57.289 --> 00:06:01.940
 little trick in between 

00:05:59.349 --> 00:06:04.250
 if your board too i could top it 

00:06:01.940 --> 00:06:08.120
 it then it should actually after 

00:06:04.250 --> 00:06:09.490
 no longer write to me once and 

00:06:08.120 --> 00:06:14.449
 peeps times I've somehow 

00:06:09.490 --> 00:06:15.979
 led the war or so yes how 

00:06:14.449 --> 00:06:20.289
 You can actually say the Carinthians 

00:06:15.979 --> 00:06:24.409
 buy any climate but expensive and 

00:06:20.289 --> 00:06:25.320
 stepfather at home or somehow ins 

00:06:24.409 --> 00:06:29.660
 water out 

00:06:25.320 --> 00:06:32.800
 the cost estimates great team but 

00:06:29.660 --> 00:06:32.800
 does not bring the woman anymore 

00:06:37.330 --> 00:06:40.150
 sounds 

00:06:38.320 --> 00:06:43.390
 I have to sometimes look what is still in the 

00:06:40.150 --> 00:06:45.160
 next time come and you can her 

00:06:43.390 --> 00:06:46.570
 Let's write in the comments if we 

00:06:45.160 --> 00:06:50.440
 that is almost not anymore 

00:06:46.570 --> 00:06:52.920
 should do these tips or what I do 

00:06:50.440 --> 00:06:55.780
 still for london 

00:06:52.920 --> 00:06:57.070
 there is a plane that discover 

00:06:55.780 --> 00:07:03.270
 absolutely not important 

00:06:57.070 --> 00:07:03.270
 yes and there, keep the dice stone
