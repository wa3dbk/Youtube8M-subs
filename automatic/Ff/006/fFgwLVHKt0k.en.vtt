00:00:18.440 --> 00:00:23.660
 three year old stalled this once 

00:00:20.450 --> 00:00:26.150
 run but second third themes 

00:00:23.660 --> 00:00:28.099
 also deliver very bbh very green private 

00:00:26.150 --> 00:00:30.200
 much hopes he has now before 

00:00:28.099 --> 00:00:32.989
 profited greatly from the first race 

00:00:30.200 --> 00:00:34.640
 mentally evolving and so on 

00:00:32.989 --> 00:00:36.410
 then a hochtragen naming not 

00:00:34.640 --> 00:00:39.489
 only in German derbys in English 

00:00:36.410 --> 00:00:39.489
 but that is still very daring 

00:01:03.300 --> 00:01:08.980
 so here we have both is my his 

00:01:07.480 --> 00:01:10.570
 Send career very promising 

00:01:08.980 --> 00:01:14.230
 last year though until derby 

00:01:10.570 --> 00:01:16.120
 unbeaten and then over it scarce 

00:01:14.230 --> 00:01:17.440
 beaten second and the night of 

00:01:16.120 --> 00:01:19.030
 start was not so happy 

00:01:17.440 --> 00:01:21.460
 to fall down so that it has its 

00:01:19.030 --> 00:01:24.250
 form found and then has in 

00:01:21.460 --> 00:01:26.980
 Group one won and won 

00:01:24.250 --> 00:01:28.060
 These are pretty good things with you 

00:01:26.980 --> 00:01:30.520
 you are still one click away 

00:01:28.060 --> 00:01:32.260
 will increase because he has become 

00:01:30.520 --> 00:01:35.830
 evolves and makes the work 

00:01:32.260 --> 00:01:37.960
 Very good impression he would be to may 

00:01:35.830 --> 00:01:39.640
 make his seasonal debut either in 

00:01:37.960 --> 00:01:41.770
 Baden-Baden or in Cologne 

00:01:39.640 --> 00:01:43.119
 and if that fails accordingly 

00:01:41.770 --> 00:01:46.560
 then we should be too 

00:01:43.119 --> 00:01:46.560
 international transmitter on head 

00:01:59.560 --> 00:02:03.170

00:02:03.170 --> 00:02:06.560
 performance shown 

00:02:04.070 --> 00:02:09.679
 unfortunately it was very bad in swimming 

00:02:06.560 --> 00:02:14.060
 Separate bathing in the future and running 

00:02:09.679 --> 00:02:18.140
 has and was fourth and very good 

00:02:14.060 --> 00:02:20.239
 horse but maximum 600 meters 1 chefs 

00:02:18.140 --> 00:02:22.489

00:02:24.950 --> 00:02:52.970
 should be good then should also 

00:02:28.580 --> 00:02:57.069
 antique willing tarnish yet unnamed 

00:02:52.970 --> 00:02:59.480
 lady came from the parents of the motto 

00:02:57.069 --> 00:03:01.040

00:04:13.240 --> 00:04:16.890
 have them and if that is then it will be 

00:04:18.720 --> 00:04:26.380
