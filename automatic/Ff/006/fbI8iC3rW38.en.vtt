and<00:01:43.829> the<00:01:43.979> back<00:01:44.189> was<00:01:44.430> off<00:01:44.670> this<00:01:44.909> was<00:01:45.090> just

00:01:45.289 --> 00:01:45.299 
and the back was off this was just

00:01:45.299 --> 00:01:47.510 
and the back was off this was just
basically<00:01:45.600> a<00:01:45.810> one<00:01:46.170> light<00:01:46.380> setup<00:01:46.710> and<00:01:47.009> the

00:01:48.980 --> 00:01:48.990 
second we're going to have a look at my

00:01:48.990 --> 00:01:52.160 
second we're going to have a look at my
camera<00:01:49.290> settings<00:01:49.619> and<00:01:50.009> I<00:01:50.880> shot<00:01:51.360> this<00:01:51.600> on<00:01:51.869> the

00:01:52.160 --> 00:01:52.170 
camera settings and I shot this on the

00:01:52.170 --> 00:01:58.280 
camera settings and I shot this on the
85<00:01:52.560> mil<00:01:53.070> at<00:01:53.340> F<00:01:54.180> 5.6<00:01:55.140> shutter<00:01:56.130> speed<00:01:56.430> 200<00:01:57.180> in<00:01:57.329> ISO

85 mil at F 5.6 shutter speed 200 in ISO

00:01:58.290 --> 00:02:00.499 
85 mil at F 5.6 shutter speed 200 in ISO
100<00:01:59.189> so<00:01:59.490> that's<00:01:59.610> a<00:01:59.729> look<00:01:59.850> at<00:02:00.000> one<00:02:00.119> of<00:02:00.240> the<00:02:00.299> shots

00:02:29.050 --> 00:02:29.060 
I'm over directing Emily and it's really

00:02:29.060 --> 00:02:30.580 
I'm over directing Emily and it's really
not<00:02:29.299> working<00:02:29.540> and<00:02:29.900> it's<00:02:30.019> killing<00:02:30.349> the<00:02:30.440> vibe

00:02:30.580 --> 00:02:30.590 
not working and it's killing the vibe

00:02:30.590 --> 00:02:33.250 
not working and it's killing the vibe
and<00:02:30.980> so<00:02:31.940> I<00:02:31.970> basically<00:02:32.299> said<00:02:32.750> okay<00:02:32.959> I<00:02:33.019> give<00:02:33.230> up

00:02:33.250 --> 00:02:33.260 
and so I basically said okay I give up

00:02:33.260 --> 00:02:35.559 
and so I basically said okay I give up
you<00:02:33.560> just<00:02:33.830> pose<00:02:34.250> and<00:02:34.610> she<00:02:35.209> had<00:02:35.360> all<00:02:35.480> these

00:02:35.559 --> 00:02:35.569 
you just pose and she had all these

00:02:35.569 --> 00:02:37.960 
you just pose and she had all these
amazing<00:02:36.140> dramatic<00:02:36.290> posing<00:02:36.980> ideas<00:02:37.340> that<00:02:37.940> I

00:02:37.960 --> 00:02:37.970 
amazing dramatic posing ideas that I

00:02:37.970 --> 00:02:39.069 
amazing dramatic posing ideas that I
wouldn't<00:02:38.450> have<00:02:38.569> thought<00:02:38.720> of

00:02:39.069 --> 00:02:39.079 
wouldn't have thought of

00:02:39.079 --> 00:02:41.619 
wouldn't have thought of
I<00:02:39.110> don't<00:02:39.590> normally<00:02:39.799> think<00:02:40.329> of<00:02:41.329> things<00:02:41.540> that

00:02:41.619 --> 00:02:41.629 
I don't normally think of things that

00:02:41.629 --> 00:02:43.809 
I don't normally think of things that
way<00:02:41.780> and<00:02:42.230> she<00:02:42.920> just<00:02:43.069> came<00:02:43.190> up<00:02:43.250> with<00:02:43.370> some<00:02:43.640> stuff

00:02:43.809 --> 00:02:43.819 
way and she just came up with some stuff

00:02:43.819 --> 00:02:45.699 
way and she just came up with some stuff
that<00:02:44.000> was<00:02:44.090> so<00:02:44.239> dramatic<00:02:44.420> and<00:02:44.959> I<00:02:45.230> think<00:02:45.620> it

00:02:45.699 --> 00:02:45.709 
that was so dramatic and I think it

00:02:45.709 --> 00:02:47.020 
that was so dramatic and I think it
really<00:02:45.860> helped<00:02:46.280> everything<00:02:46.700> pull<00:02:46.910> together

00:02:47.020 --> 00:02:47.030 
really helped everything pull together

00:02:47.030 --> 00:02:49.900 
really helped everything pull together
and<00:02:47.480> so<00:02:48.140> one<00:02:48.500> thing<00:02:48.530> I<00:02:48.739> can<00:02:48.890> pass<00:02:49.040> on<00:02:49.250> is<00:02:49.489> if

00:02:49.900 --> 00:02:49.910 
and so one thing I can pass on is if

00:02:49.910 --> 00:02:51.280 
and so one thing I can pass on is if
what<00:02:50.060> you<00:02:50.150> normally<00:02:50.269> do<00:02:50.569> isn't<00:02:50.840> working

00:02:51.280 --> 00:02:51.290 
what you normally do isn't working

00:02:51.290 --> 00:02:53.470 
what you normally do isn't working
there's<00:02:51.920> Josh<00:02:52.129> again<00:02:52.280> being<00:02:52.549> serious<00:02:52.849> but<00:02:53.299> if

00:02:53.470 --> 00:02:53.480 
there's Josh again being serious but if

00:02:53.480 --> 00:02:55.690 
there's Josh again being serious but if
what<00:02:53.660> you<00:02:53.750> normally<00:02:53.870> do<00:02:54.260> isn't<00:02:54.890> working<00:02:55.459> just

00:02:55.690 --> 00:02:55.700 
what you normally do isn't working just

00:02:55.700 --> 00:02:57.369 
what you normally do isn't working just
kind<00:02:55.879> of<00:02:55.910> relax<00:02:56.239> and<00:02:56.599> go<00:02:56.690> with<00:02:56.840> the<00:02:56.930> flow<00:02:56.959> and

00:02:57.369 --> 00:02:57.379 
kind of relax and go with the flow and

00:02:57.379 --> 00:03:00.369 
kind of relax and go with the flow and
just<00:02:57.980> see<00:02:58.250> what<00:02:58.370> happens<00:02:58.989> so<00:02:59.989> here's<00:03:00.290> another

so you can see the shot of the softbox
and<00:03:27.139> I<00:03:27.200> just<00:03:27.470> adjusted<00:03:27.950> that<00:03:28.190> by<00:03:28.430> eye<00:03:28.609> I<00:03:29.060> just

00:03:29.530 --> 00:03:29.540 
and I just adjusted that by eye I just

00:03:29.540 --> 00:03:32.020 
and I just adjusted that by eye I just
want<00:03:29.720> a<00:03:29.900> subtle<00:03:30.380> hint<00:03:30.709> to<00:03:31.370> kind<00:03:31.609> of<00:03:31.730> sort<00:03:31.970> of

00:03:32.020 --> 00:03:32.030 
want a subtle hint to kind of sort of

00:03:32.030 --> 00:03:33.940 
want a subtle hint to kind of sort of
separate<00:03:32.510> it<00:03:32.540> from<00:03:32.630> the<00:03:32.780> background<00:03:32.930> now<00:03:33.889> we

00:03:33.940 --> 00:03:33.950 
separate it from the background now we

00:03:33.950 --> 00:03:35.229 
separate it from the background now we
might<00:03:34.160> do<00:03:34.280> a<00:03:34.310> composite<00:03:34.609> for<00:03:34.940> this<00:03:35.030> shot

00:03:35.229 --> 00:03:35.239 
might do a composite for this shot

00:03:35.239 --> 00:03:37.870 
might do a composite for this shot
that'll<00:03:35.599> come<00:03:35.750> out<00:03:35.780> later<00:03:36.200> but<00:03:37.010> there's<00:03:37.730> some

00:03:37.870 --> 00:03:37.880 
that'll come out later but there's some

00:03:37.880 --> 00:03:39.099 
that'll come out later but there's some
pretty<00:03:38.000> cool<00:03:38.209> things<00:03:38.269> that<00:03:38.540> we<00:03:38.660> can<00:03:38.780> do<00:03:38.989> with

00:03:39.099 --> 00:03:39.109 
pretty cool things that we can do with

00:03:39.109 --> 00:03:41.259 
pretty cool things that we can do with
that<00:03:39.230> dress<00:03:39.470> and<00:03:39.769> so<00:03:40.519> here's<00:03:40.700> another<00:03:40.910> shot

00:03:41.259 --> 00:03:41.269
