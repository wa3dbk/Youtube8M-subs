00:00:00.679 --> 00:00:04.290
 I beg you the techniques why he modified he knows it's me who 

00:00:04.290 --> 00:00:05.170
 play 

00:00:05.170 --> 00:00:08.639
 so happy that's what we received less well for 2010 the waters 

00:00:09.309 --> 00:00:12.860
 we are just a little bit of slack use our resources that I publish 

00:00:12.860 --> 00:00:13.999
 the board 

00:00:13.999 --> 00:00:15.389
 a pretty 

00:00:15.389 --> 00:00:18.389
 first of all let's talk about it in the field 

00:00:19.230 --> 00:00:20.409
 he had a lot 

00:00:20.409 --> 00:00:23.919
 for the little jokes bourne says it's not worth it to have a flock 

00:00:24.529 --> 00:00:27.779
 for the salma month of june 

00:00:27.779 --> 00:00:30.779
 more the world like a medallion 

00:00:31.300 --> 00:00:34.750
 I took some pigeons 

00:00:34.750 --> 00:00:36.510
 you return the animal 

00:00:36.510 --> 00:00:37.790
 on wheels 

00:00:37.790 --> 00:00:40.030
 let's see 

00:00:40.030 --> 00:00:43.440
 there is stock is not to block the legs to avoid that he had touched 

00:00:43.440 --> 00:00:45.020
 the pendulum 

00:00:45.020 --> 00:00:48.020
 and let you take no death but I live with my hands 

00:00:48.970 --> 00:00:51.040
 and wait for you 

00:00:51.040 --> 00:00:55.150
 here is for me a month ago a little rotating pot to roll in the port 

00:00:55.150 --> 00:00:56.520
 it's different 

00:00:56.520 --> 00:00:59.390
 the voice of these just we will say 

00:00:59.390 --> 00:01:02.390
 the pendulum swings only on a rotation 

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:06.230
 gold back right left 

00:01:06.230 --> 00:01:07.530
 or 

00:01:07.530 --> 00:01:10.960
 céline dumerc 

00:01:10.960 --> 00:01:13.960
 symbol that means those of the day there is not bad 

00:01:18.940 --> 00:01:21.380
 I know it's more like a pigeon 

00:01:21.380 --> 00:01:24.300
 by knowing hummer subject 

00:01:24.300 --> 00:01:27.490
 and until now no error is made 

00:01:27.490 --> 00:01:30.490
 small bangolo rotation from behind 

00:01:36.020 --> 00:01:37.520
 identification 

00:01:37.520 --> 00:01:38.950
 it's my direct 

00:01:38.950 --> 00:01:40.790
 it's not bad of 2008 

00:01:40.790 --> 00:01:43.790
 I will seek the same opinion 

00:01:53.510 --> 00:01:54.940
 same strategy 

00:01:54.940 --> 00:01:57.580
 to turn the animal 

00:01:57.580 --> 00:02:00.580
 to block his paws 

00:02:04.320 --> 00:02:06.590
 none of the clocks 

00:02:06.590 --> 00:02:09.969
 and let you do 

00:02:09.969 --> 00:02:12.969
 while we clearly see a rotation with conditions 

00:02:13.519 --> 00:02:15.439
 the pendulum 

00:02:15.439 --> 00:02:18.119
 revolves around itself 

00:02:18.119 --> 00:02:21.119
 - circle 

00:02:23.079 --> 00:02:26.079
 sign that the magnetism released 

00:02:26.889 --> 00:02:29.889
 he tells me that it is a very good 

00:02:31.419 --> 00:02:33.959
 you can try 

00:02:33.959 --> 00:02:36.959
 seillière and realized without special effects 

00:02:41.579 --> 00:02:44.809
 three generations who do not disdain good 

00:02:44.809 --> 00:02:46.759
 I do not take another 

00:02:46.759 --> 00:02:49.679
 - blah 

00:02:49.679 --> 00:02:52.679
 the pretty out of the Swiss sport continues anyway 

00:03:00.569 --> 00:03:03.569
 block the doors 

00:03:04.649 --> 00:03:07.649
 gold if this pendulum 

00:03:08.859 --> 00:03:11.859
 and you want this pendulum work 

00:03:14.169 --> 00:03:17.169
 a rounded a drawn circle 

00:03:20.669 --> 00:03:23.799
 so be careful to leave to three centimeters to avoid any 

00:03:23.799 --> 00:03:26.509
 image in contact with the feathers 

00:03:26.509 --> 00:03:28.999
 she can in a room without wind 

00:03:28.999 --> 00:03:30.809
 here is the clock 

00:03:30.809 --> 00:03:34.089
 you pedal béraud 

00:03:34.089 --> 00:03:37.089
 unisport this time 

00:03:39.099 --> 00:03:41.229
 gaby pigeons 

00:03:41.229 --> 00:03:44.269
 the facts were greatly the new white macbook automatically 

00:03:44.269 --> 00:03:45.599
 falling on a dummy 

00:03:45.599 --> 00:03:48.599
 choko barrios 

00:03:50.379 --> 00:03:53.399
 the young back season is good 

00:03:53.399 --> 00:03:55.289
 the driver of the complete players 

00:03:55.289 --> 00:03:58.289
 I know it's not bad 

00:04:03.009 --> 00:04:04.779
 all sectors the pendulum 

00:04:04.779 --> 00:04:08.639
 he compared to pendulum apple employees of failover he's not doing 

00:04:08.639 --> 00:04:11.639
 beautiful gesture is not was not fair play 

00:04:12.489 --> 00:04:15.049
 var justin points 

00:04:15.049 --> 00:04:16.879
 a rotation 

00:04:16.879 --> 00:04:19.249
 before behind 

00:04:19.249 --> 00:04:22.249
 slightly lateral 

00:04:22.809 --> 00:04:25.430
 and we will not be able to pay or pay 

00:04:25.430 --> 00:04:27.789
 rotation 

00:04:27.789 --> 00:04:28.770
 serving 

00:04:28.770 --> 00:04:30.180
 we are of course not bad
