00:05:30.400 --> 00:05:30.410 
kind of a challenge for us was to make

00:05:30.410 --> 00:05:33.730 
kind of a challenge for us was to make
the<00:05:30.560> different<00:05:30.860> pilots<00:05:31.870> behind<00:05:32.870> the<00:05:33.080> behind

00:05:33.730 --> 00:05:33.740 
the different pilots behind the behind

00:05:33.740 --> 00:05:36.879 
the different pilots behind the behind
the<00:05:34.039> snowplow<00:05:34.639> you<00:05:35.300> have<00:05:35.539> a<00:05:35.570> flat<00:05:36.110> pilot<00:05:36.710> and

00:05:36.879 --> 00:05:36.889 
the snowplow you have a flat pilot and

00:05:39.339 --> 00:05:39.349 
that's what the Canadians had but on the

00:05:39.349 --> 00:05:43.540 
that's what the Canadians had but on the
rear<00:05:39.669> they<00:05:40.669> cut<00:05:40.970> it<00:05:41.120> out<00:05:41.289> it<00:05:42.289> was<00:05:42.500> hollow<00:05:42.770> so

00:05:43.540 --> 00:05:43.550 
rear they cut it out it was hollow so

00:05:43.550 --> 00:05:45.370 
rear they cut it out it was hollow so
we've<00:05:43.700> had<00:05:43.880> that<00:05:44.120> we've<00:05:44.599> had<00:05:44.780> to<00:05:44.900> take<00:05:45.110> and<00:05:45.320> the
