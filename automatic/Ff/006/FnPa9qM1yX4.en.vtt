00:00:02.939 --> 00:00:06.299
 it works here you can see a tutorial 

00:00:04.230 --> 00:00:07.830
 to create the computer that doesn't 

00:00:06.299 --> 00:00:10.590
 I'll show why it's already built of 

00:00:07.830 --> 00:00:14.460
 standard and have twitter and youtube of 

00:00:10.590 --> 00:00:16.350
 creator that mc machisti in well written 

00:00:14.460 --> 00:00:18.630
 read well in me but who are you but who is 

00:00:16.350 --> 00:00:21.270
 in bo vabbÃ¨ go forward 

00:00:18.630 --> 00:00:23.130
 then we need a computer a block of 

00:00:21.270 --> 00:00:25.080
 iron the block of iron put it here 

00:00:23.130 --> 00:00:27.060
 the computer we throw on so yes 

00:00:25.080 --> 00:00:29.310
 place only watch this built 

00:00:27.060 --> 00:00:34.020
 it is not a fashion I remind you is not a mod 

00:00:29.310 --> 00:00:38.640
 ok then we need a meter star 64 

00:00:34.020 --> 00:00:41.059
 different and 64 bit iron ingots e 

00:00:38.640 --> 00:00:44.430
 then we should throw in front here 

00:00:41.059 --> 00:00:48.180
 these ironman construction components 

00:00:44.430 --> 00:00:49.890
 suite look cool no diver date 

00:00:48.180 --> 00:00:51.390
 look cool 

00:00:49.890 --> 00:00:54.230
 now if I put myself in it look at it 

00:00:51.390 --> 00:00:57.420
 read jarvis putin suite on 

00:00:54.230 --> 00:01:00.059
 jarvis gave us the armor rightly 

00:00:57.420 --> 00:01:01.590
 I can also detect it see 

00:01:00.059 --> 00:01:03.570
 it will be enough to go up again and it will rise 

00:01:01.590 --> 00:01:05.369
 the armor of girls now 

00:01:03.570 --> 00:01:07.860
 we have the various options for this 

00:01:05.369 --> 00:01:10.040
 let's say robot so I will go out and 

00:01:07.860 --> 00:01:12.270
 I'm going to show you how to fly 

00:01:10.040 --> 00:01:14.159
 guys go by that cool as it flies 

00:01:12.270 --> 00:01:16.920
 look what cool then practically 

00:01:14.159 --> 00:01:19.020
 with phase on the web to be able to accelerate e 

00:01:16.920 --> 00:01:22.049
 increase the speed of your iron 

00:01:19.020 --> 00:01:24.270
 right man if I go down now 

00:01:22.049 --> 00:01:26.520
 because I want to go and land 

00:01:24.270 --> 00:01:28.259
 I stopped in ok it's a moment 

00:01:26.520 --> 00:01:29.549
 block of the map also because it is a lot 

00:01:28.259 --> 00:01:32.189
 heavy guy indeed comes 

00:01:29.549 --> 00:01:35.040
 advised to put it at a distance of 9 

00:01:32.189 --> 00:01:36.570
 although I would prefer to put it shorter and 

00:01:35.040 --> 00:01:39.780
 which are then random clicks when 

00:01:36.570 --> 00:01:41.970
 let's go to land in iaria see how 

00:01:39.780 --> 00:01:44.460
 I'm kidding for charge also says that 

00:01:41.970 --> 00:01:46.950
 we're going to get down I shouldn't 

00:01:44.460 --> 00:01:49.140
 die I should land by logic 

00:01:46.950 --> 00:01:52.020
 let's see a little ok I raised the flai 

00:01:49.140 --> 00:01:54.119
 I should go down perfect I'm down 

00:01:52.020 --> 00:01:55.439
 guys I'll show you a little bit 

00:01:54.119 --> 00:01:57.420
 flying skills 

00:01:55.439 --> 00:01:59.159
 let's say the fist most interesting 

00:01:57.420 --> 00:02:01.320
 oh well the normal fist counts it what 

00:01:59.159 --> 00:02:03.780
 it was a sword and does a lot of damage 

00:02:01.320 --> 00:02:06.090
 here it does more harm 19.5 shop in 

00:02:03.780 --> 00:02:07.950
 ten goals then we have the stamp 

00:02:06.090 --> 00:02:11.370
 not even a kind of enhanced bow 

00:02:07.950 --> 00:02:12.190
 look you charge it would be nothing but 

00:02:11.370 --> 00:02:14.230
 the radius of a 

00:02:12.190 --> 00:02:17.260
 then romain can also do another 

00:02:14.230 --> 00:02:20.590
 skill I shoot tremble q 

00:02:17.260 --> 00:02:26.200
 but by that cool I can do it as well 

00:02:20.590 --> 00:02:28.000
 others is a bit fantastic then 

00:02:26.200 --> 00:02:29.890
 we shoot dry and throw the 

00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:32.770
 glove with reactors in fact indeed 

00:02:29.890 --> 00:02:36.280
 one rises from the hand and returns only 

00:02:32.770 --> 00:02:37.960
 after he slams you watch we are it 

00:02:36.280 --> 00:02:39.400
 threw the after a tot should slam 

00:02:37.960 --> 00:02:40.930
 put it back in your hand 

00:02:39.400 --> 00:02:44.440
 we have bombs the months buoys launch 

00:02:40.930 --> 00:02:47.250
 with which he makes them to area and these bombs 

00:02:44.440 --> 00:02:50.890
 they will all explode will do a lot of damage 

00:02:47.250 --> 00:02:52.570
 then we pick up and find hoods I find 

00:02:50.890 --> 00:02:54.370
 they only serve to bring people 

00:02:52.570 --> 00:02:55.780
 while in flight with the pick up and the 

00:02:54.370 --> 00:02:57.640
 can the clay for you back there the 

00:02:55.780 --> 00:03:00.010
 you can leave so they are skills 

00:02:57.640 --> 00:03:02.560
 quite simple, oh, I see something 

00:03:00.010 --> 00:03:04.780
 strange or wrong 

00:03:02.560 --> 00:03:06.880
 these are not all iron armor 

00:03:04.780 --> 00:03:10.660
 there is something on the wall that month 

00:03:06.880 --> 00:03:12.880
 does not go to this strange map as a thing 

00:03:10.660 --> 00:03:14.530
 okay guys this was the mode 

00:03:12.880 --> 00:03:17.080
 today's vanilla a very fashion 

00:03:14.530 --> 00:03:19.090
 particular because 1.8 point 4 and not 

00:03:17.080 --> 00:03:20.560
 it precisely requires no mode and is from 

00:03:19.090 --> 00:03:22.660
 upstream of iron therefore with the period ad 

00:03:20.560 --> 00:03:23.830
 to be there are also the rangers at the cinema 

00:03:22.660 --> 00:03:26.290
 I must say that we have a nice bike 

00:03:23.830 --> 00:03:28.570
 exactly got it okay guys tell me 

00:03:26.290 --> 00:03:29.950
 immediately if a useless hashtag expired here 

00:03:28.570 --> 00:03:32.850
 below the comments as always see you 

00:03:29.950 --> 00:03:32.850
 the next episode of fashions
