the car in the right-hander yeah
it<00:03:33.989> doesn't<00:03:34.319> second-guess<00:03:34.739> to<00:03:35.040> shores<00:03:35.280> now<00:03:35.900> I

00:03:39.410 --> 00:03:39.420 
know he sounds that the RPM dropping he

00:03:39.420 --> 00:03:41.540 
know he sounds that the RPM dropping he
might<00:03:39.600> just<00:03:39.840> seem<00:03:40.080> in<00:03:40.230> the<00:03:40.350> proper<00:03:41.130> care<00:03:41.280> of<00:03:41.340> it

front<00:03:47.940> of<00:03:48.120> the<00:03:48.180> press<00:03:48.420> so<00:03:48.690> it's<00:03:48.900> better<00:03:49.110> to<00:03:49.260> let

00:03:49.460 --> 00:03:49.470 
front of the press so it's better to let

00:03:49.470 --> 00:03:51.350 
front of the press so it's better to let
it<00:03:49.590> roll<00:03:49.739> in<00:03:50.010> third<00:03:50.220> now<00:03:50.580> if<00:03:50.880> you<00:03:51.000> watch<00:03:51.120> the

00:03:51.350 --> 00:03:51.360 
it roll in third now if you watch the

00:03:51.360 --> 00:03:53.210 
it roll in third now if you watch the
Falls<00:03:51.660> Palmer<00:03:52.170> if<00:03:52.620> you<00:03:52.709> want<00:03:52.830> to<00:03:52.890> interfere

Falls Palmer if you want to interfere

00:03:53.220 --> 00:03:55.220 
Falls Palmer if you want to interfere
with<00:03:53.400> and<00:03:53.700> it<00:03:53.760> was<00:03:53.850> silent<00:03:54.330> is<00:03:54.840> that<00:03:55.019> right<00:03:55.140> and

00:03:55.220 --> 00:03:55.230 
with and it was silent is that right and

00:03:55.230 --> 00:03:56.540 
with and it was silent is that right and
then<00:03:55.320> he<00:03:55.410> went<00:03:55.560> to<00:03:55.680> the<00:03:55.890> crash<00:03:56.100> then<00:03:56.400> it<00:03:56.459> was

00:03:56.540 --> 00:03:56.550 
then he went to the crash then it was

00:03:56.550 --> 00:03:57.559 
then he went to the crash then it was
like

00:03:57.559 --> 00:03:57.569 
like

00:03:57.569 --> 00:03:59.300 
like
and<00:03:57.810> even<00:03:58.050> then<00:03:58.230> we<00:03:58.620> got<00:03:58.800> a<00:03:58.830> little<00:03:59.069> bit<00:03:59.160> wide

00:03:59.300 --> 00:03:59.310 
and even then we got a little bit wide

00:03:59.310 --> 00:04:01.790 
and even then we got a little bit wide
now<00:03:59.610> so<00:03:59.910> you're<00:04:00.780> adding<00:04:01.019> rolling<00:04:01.500> the<00:04:01.620> car

00:04:01.790 --> 00:04:01.800 
now so you're adding rolling the car

00:04:01.800 --> 00:04:09.390 
now so you're adding rolling the car
whilst<00:04:02.400> is<00:04:02.790> very<00:04:03.000> important

more<00:04:51.050> than<00:04:51.110> the<00:04:51.770> few<00:04:51.949> laps<00:04:52.130> he's<00:04:52.310> done<00:04:52.520> to<00:04:52.729> get

00:04:52.840 --> 00:04:52.850 
more than the few laps he's done to get

00:04:52.850 --> 00:04:55.450 
more than the few laps he's done to get
settled<00:04:53.120> but<00:04:53.810> he's<00:04:54.199> a<00:04:54.229> professional<00:04:54.440> so<00:04:54.949> it

00:04:55.450 --> 00:04:55.460 
settled but he's a professional so it

00:04:55.460 --> 00:04:56.830 
settled but he's a professional so it
wasn't<00:04:55.760> a<00:04:55.789> problem<00:04:55.820> obviously<00:04:56.449> you<00:04:56.539> can<00:04:56.660> see

00:04:56.830 --> 00:04:56.840 
wasn't a problem obviously you can see

00:04:56.840 --> 00:04:58.870 
wasn't a problem obviously you can see
now<00:04:57.500> have<00:04:57.740> a<00:04:57.830> bit<00:04:57.949> of<00:04:57.979> experience<00:04:58.130> I<00:04:58.580> can<00:04:58.729> see

00:04:58.870 --> 00:04:58.880 
now have a bit of experience I can see

00:04:58.880 --> 00:05:01.450 
now have a bit of experience I can see
the<00:04:59.150> areas<00:04:59.419> where<00:04:59.680> once<00:05:00.680> he<00:05:00.800> gains<00:05:01.039> confidence

00:05:01.450 --> 00:05:01.460 
the areas where once he gains confidence

00:05:01.460 --> 00:05:03.310 
the areas where once he gains confidence
where<00:05:01.910> he'd<00:05:02.030> let<00:05:02.210> the<00:05:02.330> car<00:05:02.510> roll<00:05:02.780> a<00:05:02.840> bit<00:05:03.139> more

00:05:03.310 --> 00:05:03.320 
where he'd let the car roll a bit more

00:05:03.320 --> 00:05:05.230 
where he'd let the car roll a bit more
but<00:05:03.919> the<00:05:04.099> worst<00:05:04.310> thing<00:05:04.550> for<00:05:04.580> a<00:05:04.789> driver<00:05:05.030> when

00:05:05.230 --> 00:05:05.240 
but the worst thing for a driver when

00:05:05.240 --> 00:05:06.339 
but the worst thing for a driver when
you're<00:05:05.360> learning<00:05:05.539> a<00:05:05.599> car<00:05:05.780> is<00:05:05.930> if<00:05:06.020> you<00:05:06.110> let<00:05:06.260> the

00:05:06.339 --> 00:05:06.349 
you're learning a car is if you let the

00:05:06.349 --> 00:05:07.960 
you're learning a car is if you let the
car<00:05:06.530> roll<00:05:06.770> and<00:05:07.070> then<00:05:07.160> you<00:05:07.250> find<00:05:07.460> out<00:05:07.610> is<00:05:07.789> too

00:05:07.960 --> 00:05:07.970 
car roll and then you find out is too

00:05:07.970 --> 00:05:09.670 
car roll and then you find out is too
much<00:05:08.150> speed<00:05:08.449> there's<00:05:09.020> only<00:05:09.139> one<00:05:09.320> way<00:05:09.500> you're

00:05:09.670 --> 00:05:09.680 
much speed there's only one way you're

00:05:09.680 --> 00:05:11.469 
much speed there's only one way you're
going<00:05:09.979> and<00:05:10.099> that's<00:05:10.280> into<00:05:10.550> the<00:05:10.580> gravel<00:05:10.820> or<00:05:11.240> into

00:05:11.469 --> 00:05:11.479 
going and that's into the gravel or into

00:05:11.479 --> 00:05:13.930 
going and that's into the gravel or into
the<00:05:11.570> tyres<00:05:11.780> and<00:05:12.169> just<00:05:13.039> listening<00:05:13.400> to<00:05:13.460> David<00:05:13.820> we

00:05:15.430 --> 00:05:15.440

00:05:18.730 --> 00:05:18.740 
for BBC I in f1 and he's always so

00:05:18.740 --> 00:05:20.920 
for BBC I in f1 and he's always so
enthusiastic<00:05:18.889> and<00:05:19.699> it<00:05:19.910> really<00:05:20.240> got<00:05:20.449> me<00:05:20.660> going

00:05:20.920 --> 00:05:20.930 
enthusiastic and it really got me going

00:05:20.930 --> 00:05:27.240 
enthusiastic and it really got me going
and<00:05:21.169> giving<00:05:21.320> me<00:05:21.440> the<00:05:21.530> bug<00:05:21.680> again

00:05:27.240 --> 00:05:27.250 

00:05:27.250 --> 00:05:29.100 

so<00:05:27.940> to<00:05:28.000> make<00:05:28.270> some<00:05:28.480> of<00:05:28.540> the<00:05:28.630> one<00:05:28.750> at<00:05:28.900> the<00:05:28.930> bottom

00:05:29.100 --> 00:05:29.110 
so to make some of the one at the bottom

00:05:29.110 --> 00:05:31.350 
so to make some of the one at the bottom
right-hand<00:05:29.410> corner<00:05:29.920> I<00:05:29.980> think<00:05:30.160> that's<00:05:30.340> we<00:05:30.730> just

00:05:31.350 --> 00:05:31.360

I mean just going partying I think

00:05:39.910 --> 00:05:41.280

before<00:05:40.000> the<00:05:40.180> reset<00:05:40.660> why<00:05:40.840> they<00:05:40.990> never<00:05:41.170> remember

00:05:41.280 --> 00:05:41.290 
before the reset why they never remember

00:05:41.290 --> 00:05:46.700 
before the reset why they never remember
