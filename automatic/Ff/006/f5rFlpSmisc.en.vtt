another look at the gorilla sitting by

00:01:26.869 --> 00:01:33.550 
another look at the gorilla sitting by
his<00:01:28.240> tree<00:01:29.240> and<00:01:31.750> maybe<00:01:32.750> he's<00:01:32.930> just<00:01:33.020> not<00:01:33.110> used<00:01:33.380> to

00:01:33.550 --> 00:01:33.560 
his tree and maybe he's just not used to

00:01:33.560 --> 00:01:41.929 
his tree and maybe he's just not used to
his<00:01:33.680> new<00:01:33.860> house<00:01:34.450> for<00:01:35.450> his<00:01:35.570> new<00:01:35.720> garden
