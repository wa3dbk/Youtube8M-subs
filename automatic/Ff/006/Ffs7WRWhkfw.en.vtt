this

00:02:49.360 --> 00:02:49.370 

00:02:49.370 --> 00:02:51.470 

so<00:02:50.370> we're<00:02:50.490> going<00:02:50.580> to<00:02:50.640> keep<00:02:50.790> our<00:02:51.000> heat<00:02:51.210> on<00:02:51.300> high

00:02:51.470 --> 00:02:51.480 
so we're going to keep our heat on high

00:02:51.480 --> 00:02:53.300 
so we're going to keep our heat on high
so<00:02:52.170> we<00:02:52.260> want<00:02:52.440> to<00:02:52.500> sear<00:02:52.740> it<00:02:52.770> and<00:02:52.830> get<00:02:52.980> that<00:02:53.100> good

00:02:53.300 --> 00:02:53.310

00:02:53.310 --> 00:02:54.680 
so we want to sear it and get that good
flavor<00:02:53.460> there<00:02:53.820> I<00:02:53.850> put<00:02:54.060> a<00:02:54.090> little<00:02:54.240> salt<00:02:54.510> in

00:02:54.680 --> 00:02:54.690 
flavor there I put a little salt in

00:02:54.690 --> 00:02:56.210 
flavor there I put a little salt in
there<00:02:54.870> so<00:02:55.350> the<00:02:55.440> flavors<00:02:55.770> start<00:02:55.980> coming

00:02:56.210 --> 00:02:56.220 
there so the flavors start coming

00:02:56.220 --> 00:02:57.350 
there so the flavors start coming
together<00:02:56.340> of<00:02:56.610> course<00:02:56.760> you<00:02:56.940> want<00:02:57.060> to<00:02:57.120> season

00:02:57.350 --> 00:02:57.360 
together of course you want to season

00:02:57.360 --> 00:02:58.940 
together of course you want to season
that<00:02:57.600> salt<00:02:57.870> in<00:02:58.020> the<00:02:58.110> tomato<00:02:58.380> so<00:02:58.590> it<00:02:58.680> tastes

00:02:58.940 --> 00:02:58.950 
that salt in the tomato so it tastes

00:02:58.950 --> 00:03:00.950 
that salt in the tomato so it tastes
like<00:02:59.070> a<00:02:59.100> seasoned<00:02:59.490> tomato<00:02:59.760> but<00:03:00.540> when<00:03:00.660> you<00:03:00.780> come

00:03:00.950 --> 00:03:00.960 
like a seasoned tomato but when you come

00:03:00.960 --> 00:03:02.210 
like a seasoned tomato but when you come
over<00:03:01.140> and<00:03:01.320> you<00:03:01.410> shake<00:03:01.650> it<00:03:01.680> up<00:03:01.890> you<00:03:02.010> don't<00:03:02.100> want

00:03:02.210 --> 00:03:02.220 
over and you shake it up you don't want

00:03:02.220 --> 00:03:04.010 
over and you shake it up you don't want
to<00:03:02.370> shake<00:03:02.520> it<00:03:02.580> up<00:03:02.790> over<00:03:02.970> the<00:03:03.150> fire<00:03:03.390> because<00:03:03.930> you

00:03:04.010 --> 00:03:04.020 
to shake it up over the fire because you

00:03:04.020 --> 00:03:05.210 
to shake it up over the fire because you
don't<00:03:04.170> want<00:03:04.290> to<00:03:04.350> flame<00:03:04.560> it<00:03:04.710> up<00:03:04.800> whenever<00:03:05.040> you

00:03:05.210 --> 00:03:05.220 
don't want to flame it up whenever you

00:03:05.220 --> 00:03:07.310 
don't want to flame it up whenever you
see<00:03:05.520> flames<00:03:05.880> on<00:03:06.150> that<00:03:06.180> you<00:03:06.810> don't<00:03:06.960> want<00:03:07.170> that

00:03:07.310 --> 00:03:07.320 
see flames on that you don't want that

00:03:07.320 --> 00:03:08.750 
see flames on that you don't want that
because<00:03:07.620> what<00:03:07.770> that<00:03:07.800> is<00:03:07.920> is<00:03:08.130> creating<00:03:08.520> a<00:03:08.580> gas

00:03:08.750 --> 00:03:08.760 
because what that is is creating a gas

00:03:08.760 --> 00:03:10.310 
because what that is is creating a gas
that's<00:03:09.000> going<00:03:09.180> to<00:03:09.240> put<00:03:09.360> a<00:03:09.390> bad<00:03:09.630> flavor<00:03:09.930> and

00:03:10.310 --> 00:03:10.320 
that's going to put a bad flavor and

00:03:10.320 --> 00:03:12.380 
that's going to put a bad flavor and
whatever<00:03:11.220> you're<00:03:11.370> making<00:03:11.490> your<00:03:11.790> pasta<00:03:12.210> or

00:03:55.580 --> 00:03:55.590 
make our decision now classic and of

00:03:55.590 --> 00:03:57.710 
make our decision now classic and of
course<00:03:55.799> I'm<00:03:56.010> so<00:03:56.189> far<00:03:56.430> from<00:03:56.459> Italian<00:03:57.030> it's<00:03:57.450> hard

course I'm so far from Italian it's hard

00:03:57.720 --> 00:03:59.030 
course I'm so far from Italian it's hard
for<00:03:57.840> me<00:03:57.930> to<00:03:58.019> really<00:03:58.260> give<00:03:58.379> a<00:03:58.409> reference<00:03:58.650> point

00:03:59.030 --> 00:03:59.040 
for me to really give a reference point

00:03:59.040 --> 00:04:01.819 
for me to really give a reference point
but<00:03:59.579> classic<00:04:00.120> rustic<00:04:00.390> kind<00:04:01.079> of<00:04:01.200> country<00:04:01.620> fare

00:05:09.770 --> 00:05:09.780 
couple times you're good to go remember

00:05:09.780 --> 00:05:11.660 
couple times you're good to go remember
you<00:05:10.020> got<00:05:10.170> hot<00:05:10.440> in<00:05:10.680> there<00:05:10.890> so<00:05:11.100> be<00:05:11.220> very<00:05:11.370> careful

00:05:13.730 --> 00:05:13.740 
all that power is going to build some

00:05:13.740 --> 00:05:15.230 
all that power is going to build some
pressure<00:05:13.980> and<00:05:14.280> make<00:05:14.520> steam<00:05:14.820> so<00:05:15.000> you<00:05:15.060> don't

00:05:15.230 --> 00:05:15.240 
pressure and make steam so you don't

00:05:15.240 --> 00:05:19.460 
pressure and make steam so you don't
want<00:05:15.390> to<00:05:15.480> go<00:05:16.440> too<00:05:16.500> fast<00:05:17.570> once<00:05:18.570> it<00:05:18.720> takes<00:05:18.960> and

you<00:05:19.530> can<00:05:19.740> see<00:05:19.890> it<00:05:20.010> that<00:05:20.100> it's<00:05:20.280> going

00:05:22.869 --> 00:05:22.879 

00:05:22.879 --> 00:05:25.299 

we're<00:05:23.240> going<00:05:23.360> to<00:05:23.419> go<00:05:23.509> nice<00:05:23.719> and<00:05:24.050> smooth<00:05:24.349> you'll
