00:00:33.090 --> 00:00:38.670
 serious almost without expression and isabel 

00:00:35.850 --> 00:00:39.600
 looking nervous I cried a lot 

00:00:38.670 --> 00:00:43.700

00:00:54.450 --> 00:00:59.280
 advertisement published in the newspaper by the family 

00:00:56.940 --> 00:01:02.970

00:00:59.280 --> 00:01:05.460

00:01:02.970 --> 00:01:07.920
 eliane gaia even raised the 

00:01:05.460 --> 00:01:11.240
 hypothesis that bruna had also been 

00:01:07.920 --> 00:01:11.240
 chosen to die 

00:01:36.350 --> 00:01:42.270

 prosecutor questioned the defendants' response 

00:01:42.270 --> 00:01:47.149
 in one of them Jorge would have said not to eat 

00:01:45.119 --> 00:01:47.149
 beef 

00:02:21.860 --> 00:02:27.510

00:02:25.050 --> 00:02:30.390
 recorded during one of the hearings of 

00:02:27.510 --> 00:02:32.819
 statement appears in the image 

00:02:30.390 --> 00:02:34.410

00:02:32.819 --> 00:02:36.360
 crime in the background 

00:02:34.410 --> 00:02:39.110
 Jorge follows it all the way. 

00:02:36.360 --> 00:02:39.110
 quiet 

00:02:53.459 --> 00:03:00.400
 It is cold calculating here the expression 

00:02:58.390 --> 00:03:03.510
 it was the same for a few moments 

00:03:00.400 --> 00:03:06.340
 I got to whisper to Isabel later. 

00:03:03.510 --> 00:03:08.880
 He sipped his coffee and smiled 

00:03:06.340 --> 00:03:11.890
 comment by bruna as isabel 

00:03:08.880 --> 00:03:14.050
 showed despair about one and 

00:03:11.890 --> 00:03:16.690
 mid-afternoon it was the turn of the defender 

00:03:14.050 --> 00:03:19.630
 Jorge's public speaking to jurors 

00:03:16.690 --> 00:03:21.610

00:03:19.630 --> 00:03:23.099
 normal I 've been very 

00:03:21.610 --> 00:03:26.350
 finalization 

00:03:23.099 --> 00:03:27.760
 they are there to the ends is a 

00:03:26.350 --> 00:03:31.180
 medication 

00:03:27.760 --> 00:03:33.519

00:03:31.180 --> 00:03:39.370
 peeling of america the flamengo needs 

00:03:33.519 --> 00:03:41.319
 food for prison does not need and then 

00:03:39.370 --> 00:03:43.720
 it was the turn of isabel's defense 

00:03:41.319 --> 00:03:46.600
 the strategy was to try to convince 

00:03:43.720 --> 00:03:49.120
 jurors that she would be submissive Jorge 

00:03:46.600 --> 00:03:53.310

 last to speak was bruna's lawyer 

00:04:09.459 --> 00:04:15.510
 he also defended the idea that she 

00:04:11.709 --> 00:04:15.510
 was forced to participate in the crimes 

00:04:18.100 --> 00:04:26.850
 who not by the idea of having a paper one 

00:04:23.850 --> 00:04:26.850
 potential
