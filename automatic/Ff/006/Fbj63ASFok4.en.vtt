00:00:11.210 --> 00:00:16.670
 at the moment I live in an apartment alone 

00:00:13.930 --> 00:00:19.880
 wife is currently on a business trip 

00:00:16.670 --> 00:00:22.670

00:00:19.880 --> 00:00:25.430

00:00:22.670 --> 00:00:27.560
 had dinner and went to the bedroom I'm a man 

00:00:25.430 --> 00:00:30.050
 careful and always closing the door on 

00:00:27.560 --> 00:00:33.290
 the lock only touched the pillow with his head 

00:00:30.050 --> 00:00:33.770
 immediately turned off woke up knocking in 

00:00:33.290 --> 00:00:35.870
 the bedroom 

00:00:33.770 --> 00:00:38.870
 wife probably returned scattering 

00:00:35.870 --> 00:00:41.329
 I thought and looked at the clock on the dial 

00:00:38.870 --> 00:00:44.239
 frozen figures 222 

00:00:41.329 --> 00:00:46.519
 and then I like water poured what she 

00:00:44.239 --> 00:00:49.129
 will return only after a week since 

00:00:46.519 --> 00:00:50.500
 called me yesterday I said that 

00:00:49.129 --> 00:00:53.179
 kept for a week 

00:00:50.500 --> 00:00:56.289
 in the meantime, the knocks made it worse 

00:00:53.179 --> 00:00:59.300
 I jumped sharply turned on the night light 

00:00:56.289 --> 00:01:01.820
 with shaking hands, grabbed a chair and 

00:00:59.300 --> 00:01:04.129
 door gray see some shadow of light in 

00:01:01.820 --> 00:01:07.130
 the corridor was not suddenly knocking stopped 

00:01:04.129 --> 00:01:10.400
 and in the kitchen there was the sound of broken dishes 

00:01:07.130 --> 00:01:12.590
 I did not have time to think how to knock on the door again 

00:01:10.400 --> 00:01:15.930
 this time us the world someone scraper 

00:01:12.590 --> 00:01:18.270
 not that filled the sound of cat claws 

00:01:15.930 --> 00:01:21.210
 I did not understand what I need to do next 

00:01:18.270 --> 00:01:23.940
 I wanted to call the police when suddenly 

00:01:21.210 --> 00:01:26.010
 the light went out and here I stand in my hand with 

00:01:23.940 --> 00:01:26.760
 mobile phone and see how the door opens 

00:01:26.010 --> 00:01:29.400
 bedrooms 

00:01:26.760 --> 00:01:32.130
 but it is impossible because she was 

00:01:29.400 --> 00:01:33.840
 closed on the lock side of the door stood a man 

00:01:32.130 --> 00:01:36.390
 in Russian clown costume 

00:01:33.840 --> 00:01:37.740
 his crooked face fell apart into some kind 

00:01:36.390 --> 00:01:41.250
 wide wild smile 

00:01:37.740 --> 00:01:44.040
 yellow fangs stuck out of him 

00:01:41.250 --> 00:01:46.470
 looked at me with rabid eyes that 

00:01:44.040 --> 00:01:49.430
 the moment you eat the wave at the chair rushed 

00:01:46.470 --> 00:01:52.259
 melee last thing I remember 

00:01:49.430 --> 00:01:55.070
 it was like a smelly train 

00:01:52.259 --> 00:01:58.020
 I'll wake up on the floor in the corridor next 

00:01:55.070 --> 00:02:02.840
 broken chair on the door note 

00:01:58.020 --> 00:02:02.840
 clear words I saw words boring
