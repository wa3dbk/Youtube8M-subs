let<00:00:17.880> me<00:00:17.970> show<00:00:18.210> you<00:00:18.350> if<00:00:19.350> you<00:00:19.470> press<00:00:19.710> the<00:00:19.859> button

00:00:20.150 --> 00:00:20.160 
let me show you if you press the button

00:00:20.160 --> 00:00:24.080 
let me show you if you press the button
it<00:00:21.080> let<00:00:22.080> this<00:00:22.199> block<00:00:22.439> disappear<00:00:23.100> and<00:00:23.310> it<00:00:23.880> moves

00:00:24.080 --> 00:00:24.090 
it let this block disappear and it moves

00:00:24.090 --> 00:00:28.130 
it let this block disappear and it moves
that<00:00:24.510> way<00:00:25.310> with<00:00:26.310> this<00:00:26.430> one<00:00:26.670> and<00:00:27.109> time<00:00:28.109> is

00:00:28.130 --> 00:00:28.140 
that way with this one and time is

00:00:28.140 --> 00:00:30.859 
that way with this one and time is
serial<00:00:28.680> so<00:00:29.010> it<00:00:29.820> removes<00:00:30.240> the<00:00:30.390> block<00:00:30.599> that<00:00:30.750> is

00:00:30.859 --> 00:00:30.869 
serial so it removes the block that is

00:00:30.869 --> 00:00:36.979 
serial so it removes the block that is
standing<00:00:31.230> here<00:00:31.439> like<00:00:32.099> didn't<00:00:35.510> and<00:00:36.510> it<00:00:36.660> makes<00:00:36.870> a

00:00:36.979 --> 00:00:36.989 
standing here like didn't and it makes a

00:00:36.989 --> 00:00:42.500 
standing here like didn't and it makes a
new<00:00:37.110> block<00:00:38.960> and<00:00:39.960> let's<00:00:40.500> move<00:00:40.680> no<00:00:41.129> way<00:00:41.340> and<00:00:41.610> this
