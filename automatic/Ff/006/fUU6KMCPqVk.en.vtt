00:01:09.210 --> 00:01:14.010
 family sport 

00:01:11.280 --> 00:01:15.150
 so put it here in this is this is real 

00:01:14.010 --> 00:01:16.530
 long time since I moved this 

00:01:15.150 --> 00:01:20.490
 taken 

00:01:16.530 --> 00:01:24.090
 yes this is from as not to and I am 

00:01:20.490 --> 00:01:27.000
 very much how many exactly houses 

00:01:24.090 --> 00:01:29.100
 this oh oh 

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:30.390
 that's why i said that 's a jan was he is 

00:01:29.100 --> 00:01:34.020
 refurbished by Jan. 

00:01:30.390 --> 00:01:36.900
 we do not Kraft for now you are good 

00:01:34.020 --> 00:01:38.520
 yes it is already very long if you do not 

00:01:36.900 --> 00:01:39.960
 building on both banks seen from me 

00:01:38.520 --> 00:01:41.280
 but certainly not even ten years or more 

00:01:39.960 --> 00:01:43.950
 more 

00:01:41.280 --> 00:01:45.200
 one track and the rest there is also a team and 

00:01:43.950 --> 00:01:47.520
 it's another reason 

00:01:45.200 --> 00:01:48.720
 I am out so I am really a little bit 

00:01:47.520 --> 00:01:50.310
 from minecraft 

00:01:48.720 --> 00:01:53.040
 so this i don't want to play or anything 

00:01:50.310 --> 00:01:57.330
 each here thicker and if there is play 

00:01:53.040 --> 00:01:59.430
 play whatever they skyrim or sustain or 

00:01:57.330 --> 00:02:01.290
 becomes stones or a book the island of 

00:01:59.430 --> 00:02:03.630
 to mention all those already mentioned 

00:02:01.290 --> 00:02:04.530
 the story is very simple there you have to 

00:02:03.630 --> 00:02:06.120
 just 

00:02:04.530 --> 00:02:09.030
 i found my on it far i know put the 

00:02:06.120 --> 00:02:10.649
 film well then it is women simply because 

00:02:09.030 --> 00:02:13.140
 you just get you start and i start 

00:02:10.649 --> 00:02:15.090
 the recording done by said then 

00:02:13.140 --> 00:02:16.650
 I go and I do and I have a fun 

00:02:15.090 --> 00:02:19.880
 adventure and ready 

00:02:16.650 --> 00:02:22.709
 minecraft and terraria in starbound and 

00:02:19.880 --> 00:02:23.130
 we do so much in that open world 

00:02:22.709 --> 00:02:25.410
 games 

00:02:23.130 --> 00:02:26.820
 then it starts recording and then I have to 

00:02:25.410 --> 00:02:31.740
 do everything yourself 

00:02:26.820 --> 00:02:34.680
 how just start yourself with something that you 

00:02:31.740 --> 00:02:36.570
 to make or do something or agree 

00:02:34.680 --> 00:02:37.350
 to go or look up something and 

00:02:36.570 --> 00:02:38.730
 that there 

00:02:37.350 --> 00:02:41.100
 and just listen to me next 

00:02:38.730 --> 00:02:42.180
 anubis though i am a bit i have one 

00:02:41.100 --> 00:02:43.980
 little inspiration 

00:02:42.180 --> 00:02:45.810
 that is actually the problem they see 

00:02:43.980 --> 00:02:48.390
 that I don't want to do it but I have 

00:02:45.810 --> 00:02:50.760
 just lack of inspiration 

00:02:48.390 --> 00:02:53.670
 It is also true that when I do things 

00:02:50.760 --> 00:02:56.610
 and I am going to build something then I have to 

00:02:53.670 --> 00:02:58.410
 always on one you say they are one 

00:02:56.610 --> 00:03:01.050
 hour and construction an hour and a half construction 

00:02:58.410 --> 00:03:03.180
 in the end you are using 20 now 

00:03:01.050 --> 00:03:05.430
 minutes of the image because I want 

00:03:03.180 --> 00:03:06.959
 preserve each block body 

00:03:05.430 --> 00:03:11.310
 do n't you all see it super 

00:03:06.959 --> 00:03:13.230
 boring so that also means that i don't have any 

00:03:11.310 --> 00:03:14.700
 this wim for an episode 

00:03:13.230 --> 00:03:16.019
 And that's a bit ready 

00:03:14.700 --> 00:03:17.970
 my problem so if you are thorough 

00:03:16.019 --> 00:03:21.060
 turn around minecraft that is actually it 

00:03:17.970 --> 00:03:22.680
 and therefore this video is over because watch and 

00:03:21.060 --> 00:03:23.430
 see his weather solution married calibri 

00:03:22.680 --> 00:03:27.269

00:03:23.430 --> 00:03:29.489
 been a nice couple 

00:03:27.269 --> 00:03:32.609
