00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.130
 hello in today's tutorial I love you 

00:00:02.010 --> 00:00:05.580
 teach how I make myself eyeliner 

00:00:05.130 --> 00:00:08.260
 black 

00:00:05.580 --> 00:00:12.810
 the famous layers 

00:00:08.260 --> 00:00:12.810
 and he will give you 

00:00:18.150 --> 00:00:22.189
 with a very thin brush 

00:00:23.230 --> 00:00:29.779
 and I go 

00:00:25.970 --> 00:00:33.070
 to put the brush lying on the 

00:00:29.779 --> 00:00:33.070
 tear in my eye 

00:00:40.240 --> 00:00:46.570
 and I'm going to draw 

00:00:43.160 --> 00:00:46.570
 a long line 

00:00:48.700 --> 00:00:55.600
 to where my eye ends 

00:00:51.850 --> 00:00:58.690
 once you have that line drawn I'll 

00:00:55.600 --> 00:01:03.690
 to fill 

00:00:58.690 --> 00:01:03.690
 all the parts where you can see 

00:01:04.769 --> 00:01:10.670
 still on the skin besides the way 

00:01:07.320 --> 00:01:15.450
 easier to start delineating t the eye 

00:01:10.670 --> 00:01:18.329
 or also with black pencil 

00:01:15.450 --> 00:01:20.579
 but the liquid eyeliner if it's a lot 

00:01:18.329 --> 00:01:23.120
 harder or you have to use one 

00:01:20.579 --> 00:01:26.210
 I have a little sponge 

00:01:23.120 --> 00:01:29.120
 with a lot of flexibility once 

00:01:26.210 --> 00:01:32.360
 I have the line drawn 

00:01:29.120 --> 00:01:36.260
 what we want is that when 

00:01:32.360 --> 00:01:37.700
 look up you see the tail of the 

00:01:36.260 --> 00:01:41.600
 delineated 

00:01:37.700 --> 00:01:45.220
 I like to draw a line that has 

00:01:41.600 --> 00:01:45.220
 an angle towards me I feel 

00:01:46.560 --> 00:01:50.119
 and we start from the end 

00:01:50.150 --> 00:01:54.500
 to climb the line 

00:01:52.460 --> 00:01:57.740
 this will be the criterion for everyone 

00:01:54.500 --> 00:02:00.680
 how long the 5th 

00:01:57.740 --> 00:02:04.250
 I'm going to leave it there and for 

00:02:00.680 --> 00:02:08.830
 last nothing else I'm going to put together and that's it 

00:02:04.250 --> 00:02:08.830
 how do I make myself my delineated 

00:02:10.750 --> 00:02:18.100
 and once we have the ready and 

00:02:13.570 --> 00:02:21.030
 we see that it is how we want it we can 

00:02:18.100 --> 00:02:21.030
 start 

00:02:22.110 --> 00:02:28.500
 with the other eye also this one I'm 

00:02:25.560 --> 00:02:30.660
 doing very thick so they could 

00:02:28.500 --> 00:02:32.970
 note but also at criterion can 

00:02:30.660 --> 00:02:38.180
 make much thinner or much more 

00:02:32.970 --> 00:02:38.180
 thick that that depends on everyone 

00:03:04.680 --> 00:03:10.189
 and a beauty with the curvita and we return to 

00:03:07.799 --> 00:03:10.189
 do the same 

00:03:32.080 --> 00:03:38.640
 and I'm just a matter of putting all 

00:03:35.890 --> 00:03:38.640
 points 

00:03:47.180 --> 00:03:54.390
 and seeing it turns on 

00:03:50.100 --> 00:03:57.770
 we can fix our and that's how 

00:03:54.390 --> 00:03:57.770
 I make my coffee
