00:00:00.500 --> 00:00:06.290
 as the youtube community here is 

00:00:02.330 --> 00:00:08.960
 as ops and in this video apart from coming 

00:00:06.290 --> 00:00:11.420
 to apologize for not doing videos 

00:00:08.960 --> 00:00:13.670
 four days ago because my computer 

00:00:11.420 --> 00:00:16.869
 is broken I bring you this subject 

00:00:13.670 --> 00:00:20.300
 that the second season of spartan apps 

00:00:16.869 --> 00:00:22.939
 good in the second season there are many 

00:00:20.300 --> 00:00:26.810
 questions but very few answers a 

00:00:22.939 --> 00:00:29.869
 of them it will go out for hello 4 for the 

00:00:26.810 --> 00:00:32.899
 5 good will come out so that 5 is the 

00:00:29.869 --> 00:00:35.360
 answer because to know for the 5 good 

00:00:32.899 --> 00:00:38.130
 will leave so that the 5 since departure to 

00:00:35.360 --> 00:00:42.810
 that the 4 will be something very stupid 

00:00:38.130 --> 00:00:44.730
 since it will go to hello 4 because it does not 

00:00:42.810 --> 00:00:47.640
 they would be working right now with the 

00:00:44.730 --> 00:00:50.940
 five of these days brings the event and 

00:00:47.640 --> 00:00:53.430
 trick which is the conference where the 

00:00:50.940 --> 00:00:57.050
 announcements of the video games of the 

00:00:53.430 --> 00:00:57.050
 present year of each year 

00:00:57.100 --> 00:01:02.440
 there is also another question that says to 

00:00:59.050 --> 00:01:04.809
 Who to look for whom I refer to 

00:01:02.440 --> 00:01:07.180
 howse doctor and look for jones and 217 or 

00:01:04.809 --> 00:01:09.970
 if i 117 seek the doctor 

00:01:07.180 --> 00:01:13.210
 and the answer is that the master boss 

00:01:09.970 --> 00:01:15.759
 look for doctor elsy to be able to bring 

00:01:13.210 --> 00:01:18.039
 back to cortana in fact this is what 

00:01:15.759 --> 00:01:20.229
 will try the new video game is that the 5 

00:01:18.039 --> 00:01:21.369
 of his jailers and it was 

00:01:20.229 --> 00:01:22.899
 cut 

00:01:21.369 --> 00:01:24.430
 she also returns to the cubes in the 

00:01:22.899 --> 00:01:25.600
 that five but I'm not going to talk 

00:01:24.430 --> 00:01:28.210
 of this video 

00:01:25.600 --> 00:01:30.130
 another question is what will be the new ones 

00:01:28.210 --> 00:01:31.990
 battlefields good as all 

00:01:30.130 --> 00:01:34.690
 we know ranking exploded and now we have 

00:01:31.990 --> 00:01:37.660
 a confirmed battlefield 

00:01:34.690 --> 00:01:39.490
 it might be a new planet to 

00:01:37.660 --> 00:01:42.430
 infinite board or maybe on earth 

00:01:39.490 --> 00:01:45.380
 as we saw at the end of gilo 4 that is 

00:01:42.430 --> 00:01:48.110
 fourth death of the earth 

00:01:45.380 --> 00:01:50.780
 remember that the librarian law 

00:01:48.110 --> 00:01:53.210
 a key to helsing in the chapter of 

00:01:50.780 --> 00:01:55.909
 Spartans and then really do not agree 

00:01:53.210 --> 00:01:58.070
 to be the key but what serves 

00:01:55.909 --> 00:02:00.380
 for planet students or something but something 

00:01:58.070 --> 00:02:02.270
 very dangerous have to take care and come 

00:02:00.380 --> 00:02:05.390
 so that he says to avoid the 

00:02:02.270 --> 00:02:08.240
 annihilation of this normality and of 

00:02:05.390 --> 00:02:11.390
 still existing 

00:02:08.240 --> 00:02:14.300
 Another question is 

00:02:11.390 --> 00:02:16.610
 what is the continuation of season one 

00:02:14.300 --> 00:02:18.980
 from spartan good you are two 

00:02:16.610 --> 00:02:23.880
 continuations it may be that the five or 

00:02:18.980 --> 00:02:26.500
 esparza are not season season 

00:02:23.880 --> 00:02:28.360
 Spartans the first 

00:02:26.500 --> 00:02:30.700
 the sky below hello simple 

00:02:28.360 --> 00:02:33.520
 after a season of Spartan 3 

00:02:30.700 --> 00:02:36.340
 kilos 5 then is that the 54 new 

00:02:33.520 --> 00:02:39.760
 season and then in the 6 I do not know if more 

00:02:36.340 --> 00:02:42.220
 expensive video game that would separate it from the 

00:02:39.760 --> 00:02:45.180
 conventions but let's continue since that 

00:02:42.220 --> 00:02:45.180
 I do not have it confirmed 

00:02:46.590 --> 00:02:52.920
 our thing is the other hasi plans 

00:02:50.300 --> 00:02:55.170
 really his revenge we can at the end 

00:02:52.920 --> 00:02:57.170
 He said he wants revenge but really 

00:02:55.170 --> 00:03:00.120
 He wants revenge and he's cheating 

00:02:57.170 --> 00:03:02.500
 vaccinated to get another key and 

00:03:00.120 --> 00:03:06.580
 can be delivered to infinity 

00:03:02.500 --> 00:03:09.250
 and those who do not know want the 

00:03:06.580 --> 00:03:11.920
 extinguisher annihilate her but they such 

00:03:09.250 --> 00:03:15.520
 once he thinks yes or maybe he does not think 

00:03:11.920 --> 00:03:18.730
 no maybe they have aldama so that the 

00:03:15.520 --> 00:03:21.720
 key to be able to do when coming and be able 

00:03:18.730 --> 00:03:24.720
 complete the mission that both are 

00:03:21.720 --> 00:03:24.720
 working 

00:03:25.700 --> 00:03:33.680
 and well that would be everything and they can not 

00:03:31.400 --> 00:03:36.379
 see next videos and the conference and 

00:03:33.680 --> 00:03:38.360
 tree that was very close to her and we 

00:03:36.379 --> 00:03:41.720
 they will be able to lose it just as it is the 

00:03:38.360 --> 00:03:43.910
 second the second most important thing 

00:03:41.720 --> 00:03:46.459
 of them the video games this year the 

00:03:43.910 --> 00:03:49.220
 first was the conference of the xbox 

00:03:46.459 --> 00:03:51.319
 one the albo juan event and the second one 

00:03:49.220 --> 00:03:54.940
 it is light sweet 2013 

00:03:51.319 --> 00:03:54.940
