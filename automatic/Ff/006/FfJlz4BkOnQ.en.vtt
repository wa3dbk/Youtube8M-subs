hi<00:01:57.330> I'm<00:01:57.390> Tom<00:01:57.660> Cruise<00:01:57.930> I<00:01:58.200> came<00:01:58.590> today<00:01:58.830> as<00:01:59.310> day<00:02:04.040> we

00:02:05.030 --> 00:02:05.040 
hi I'm Tom Cruise I came today as day we

00:02:05.040 --> 00:02:07.910 
hi I'm Tom Cruise I came today as day we
die<00:02:05.450> now<00:02:06.450> I'm<00:02:06.570> taking<00:02:06.690> us<00:02:06.930> some<00:02:07.140> string<00:02:07.470> as<00:02:07.650> you

00:02:07.910 --> 00:02:07.920 
die now I'm taking us some string as you

00:02:07.920 --> 00:02:09.440 
die now I'm taking us some string as you
can<00:02:08.040> see<00:02:08.250> there's<00:02:08.490> three<00:02:08.790> different<00:02:08.880> colors<00:02:09.270> I

00:02:09.440 --> 00:02:09.450 
can see there's three different colors I

00:02:09.450 --> 00:02:11.210 
can see there's three different colors I
took<00:02:09.660> the<00:02:09.960> black<00:02:10.170> color<00:02:10.440> because<00:02:10.800> it<00:02:10.830> matches

00:02:11.210 --> 00:02:11.220 
took the black color because it matches

00:02:11.220 --> 00:02:12.770 
took the black color because it matches
my<00:02:11.490> hair<00:02:11.670> color<00:02:11.910> the<00:02:12.060> most<00:02:12.240> so<00:02:12.390> take<00:02:12.570> the<00:02:12.660> one

00:02:12.770 --> 00:02:12.780 
my hair color the most so take the one

00:02:12.780 --> 00:02:16.350 
my hair color the most so take the one
that<00:02:12.900> matches<00:02:13.110> into<00:02:13.500> your<00:02:13.620> hair<00:02:13.770> color

00:02:16.350 --> 00:02:16.360 

00:02:16.360 --> 00:02:18.610 

for<00:02:17.360> me<00:02:17.510> I<00:02:17.540> thought<00:02:17.930> the<00:02:18.110> string<00:02:18.379> would<00:02:18.470> be

00:02:18.610 --> 00:02:18.620 
for me I thought the string would be

00:02:18.620 --> 00:02:20.140 
for me I thought the string would be
easier<00:02:18.950> if<00:02:19.069> I<00:02:19.129> just<00:02:19.160> poked<00:02:19.580> it<00:02:19.730> through<00:02:19.910> and

00:02:20.140 --> 00:02:20.150 
easier if I just poked it through and

00:02:20.150 --> 00:02:21.970 
easier if I just poked it through and
try<00:02:20.390> to<00:02:20.450> put<00:02:20.629> a<00:02:20.660> little<00:02:21.019> of<00:02:21.260> it<00:02:21.349> inside<00:02:21.769> the

00:02:21.970 --> 00:02:21.980 
try to put a little of it inside the

00:02:21.980 --> 00:02:23.440 
try to put a little of it inside the
bead<00:02:22.160> and<00:02:22.370> then<00:02:22.430> i'm<00:02:22.760> taking<00:02:22.790> the<00:02:23.120> glue<00:02:23.269> gun

00:02:23.440 --> 00:02:23.450 
bead and then i'm taking the glue gun

00:02:23.450 --> 00:02:31.600 
bead and then i'm taking the glue gun
and<00:02:23.480> gluing<00:02:24.349> it<00:02:24.440> around<00:02:24.769> it

00:02:31.600 --> 00:02:31.610 

00:02:31.610 --> 00:02:35.060 

you<00:02:32.810> once<00:02:33.810> the<00:02:33.960> glue<00:02:34.110> is<00:02:34.140> basically<00:02:34.620> dry<00:02:34.770> take

00:02:35.060 --> 00:02:35.070 
you once the glue is basically dry take

00:02:35.070 --> 00:02:36.830 
you once the glue is basically dry take
another<00:02:35.340> bead<00:02:35.580> and<00:02:35.760> string<00:02:36.240> it<00:02:36.390> through<00:02:36.420> and

00:02:36.830 --> 00:02:36.840 
another bead and string it through and

00:02:36.840 --> 00:02:38.690 
another bead and string it through and
then<00:02:37.260> once<00:02:37.470> you<00:02:37.590> reach<00:02:37.860> the<00:02:37.890> feather<00:02:38.280> just

00:02:38.690 --> 00:02:38.700 
then once you reach the feather just

00:02:38.700 --> 00:02:40.640 
then once you reach the feather just
push<00:02:38.940> it<00:02:38.970> down<00:02:39.270> onto<00:02:39.600> the<00:02:39.870> glue<00:02:40.110> it<00:02:40.320> will<00:02:40.470> most

00:02:40.640 --> 00:02:40.650 
push it down onto the glue it will most

00:02:40.650 --> 00:02:44.300 
push it down onto the glue it will most
likely<00:02:40.890> stick<00:02:42.650> now<00:02:43.650> to<00:02:43.710> make<00:02:43.980> it<00:02:44.100> really

00:02:44.300 --> 00:02:44.310 
likely stick now to make it really

00:02:44.310 --> 00:02:46.070 
likely stick now to make it really
secure<00:02:44.730> I'm<00:02:44.910> taking<00:02:45.360> the<00:02:45.480> glue<00:02:45.690> gun<00:02:45.870> and<00:02:45.990> I'm

00:02:46.070 --> 00:02:46.080 
secure I'm taking the glue gun and I'm

00:02:46.080 --> 00:02:47.990 
secure I'm taking the glue gun and I'm
gluing<00:02:46.440> it<00:02:46.590> on<00:02:46.740> top<00:02:47.010> of<00:02:47.190> where<00:02:47.400> I<00:02:47.460> just<00:02:47.850> added

00:02:47.990 --> 00:02:48.000 
gluing it on top of where I just added

00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:53.750 
gluing it on top of where I just added
the<00:02:48.180> new<00:02:48.360> bead<00:02:51.020> and<00:02:52.160> lastly<00:02:53.160> take<00:02:53.520> your

00:02:53.750 --> 00:02:53.760 
the new bead and lastly take your

00:02:53.760 --> 00:02:55.580 
the new bead and lastly take your
barrette<00:02:54.060> and<00:02:54.090> string<00:02:54.780> through<00:02:55.050> your<00:02:55.200> string

00:02:55.580 --> 00:02:55.590 
barrette and string through your string

00:02:55.590 --> 00:02:57.890 
barrette and string through your string
and<00:02:56.370> then<00:02:56.940> you're<00:02:57.120> going<00:02:57.270> to<00:02:57.360> glue<00:02:57.660> it<00:02:57.690> on

00:02:57.890 --> 00:02:57.900 
and then you're going to glue it on

00:02:57.900 --> 00:03:01.300 
and then you're going to glue it on
securely<00:02:58.380> so<00:02:58.650> that<00:02:58.800> it<00:02:59.010> doesn't<00:02:59.340> fall<00:02:59.700> off

00:03:01.300 --> 00:03:01.310 
securely so that it doesn't fall off

00:03:01.310 --> 00:03:03.170 
securely so that it doesn't fall off
once<00:03:02.310> you're<00:03:02.430> done<00:03:02.520> with<00:03:02.580> your<00:03:02.790> brother<00:03:03.000> hair

00:03:03.170 --> 00:03:03.180 
once you're done with your brother hair

00:03:03.180 --> 00:03:05.240 
once you're done with your brother hair
extension<00:03:03.630> it<00:03:03.810> will<00:03:03.960> look<00:03:04.110> like<00:03:04.380> a<00:03:04.620> bitch<00:03:04.950> and

00:03:05.240 --> 00:03:05.250 
extension it will look like a bitch and

00:03:05.250 --> 00:03:06.980 
extension it will look like a bitch and
now<00:03:05.490> you<00:03:05.550> can<00:03:05.880> put<00:03:06.060> it<00:03:06.120> in<00:03:06.270> your<00:03:06.390> hair<00:03:06.450> so<00:03:06.900> you

00:03:06.980 --> 00:03:06.990 
now you can put it in your hair so you

00:03:06.990 --> 00:03:09.590 
now you can put it in your hair so you
have<00:03:07.110> to<00:03:07.200> do<00:03:07.350> is<00:03:07.590> take<00:03:07.770> the<00:03:07.920> clip<00:03:08.130> and<00:03:09.030> go

00:03:09.590 --> 00:03:09.600 
have to do is take the clip and go

00:03:09.600 --> 00:03:12.320 
have to do is take the clip and go
somewhere<00:03:09.840> in<00:03:10.110> your<00:03:10.260> hair<00:03:10.500> like<00:03:11.100> here<00:03:11.910> I<00:03:11.940> guess

00:03:12.320 --> 00:03:12.330 
somewhere in your hair like here I guess

00:03:12.330 --> 00:03:16.670 
somewhere in your hair like here I guess
and<00:03:12.690> then<00:03:13.470> you<00:03:13.560> just<00:03:13.770> clip<00:03:14.070> it<00:03:14.100> in<00:03:15.410> no<00:03:16.410> one<00:03:16.530> can

00:03:16.670 --> 00:03:16.680 
and then you just clip it in no one can

00:03:16.680 --> 00:03:18.020 
and then you just clip it in no one can
see<00:03:16.860> it<00:03:16.950> and<00:03:17.130> then<00:03:17.400> look<00:03:17.580> there's<00:03:17.940> your

00:03:18.020 --> 00:03:18.030 
see it and then look there's your

00:03:18.030 --> 00:03:19.910 
see it and then look there's your
feather<00:03:18.300> hair<00:03:18.600> extension<00:03:19.290> and<00:03:19.530> you'll<00:03:19.740> just

00:03:19.910 --> 00:03:19.920 
feather hair extension and you'll just

00:03:19.920 --> 00:03:21.770 
feather hair extension and you'll just
lay<00:03:20.760> there<00:03:20.940> like<00:03:20.970> that<00:03:21.180> a<00:03:21.240> really<00:03:21.480> cool<00:03:21.630> thing

00:03:21.770 --> 00:03:21.780 
lay there like that a really cool thing
