cloves of garlic fresh once again you

00:01:08.530 --> 00:01:10.380 
cloves of garlic fresh once again you
can<00:01:08.680> cut<00:01:08.830> it<00:01:08.950> up<00:01:09.010> if<00:01:09.220> you<00:01:09.250> if<00:01:09.580> you<00:01:09.729> like<00:01:09.940> but<00:01:10.180> you

00:01:10.380 --> 00:01:10.390 
can cut it up if you if you like but you

00:01:10.390 --> 00:01:14.670 
can cut it up if you if you like but you
really<00:01:11.080> don't<00:01:11.229> need<00:01:11.410> to<00:01:12.510> then<00:01:13.510> put<00:01:13.720> in<00:01:13.840> 1/4<00:01:14.440> of

00:01:14.670 --> 00:01:14.680 
really don't need to then put in 1/4 of

00:01:14.680 --> 00:01:20.940 
really don't need to then put in 1/4 of
a<00:01:14.770> cup<00:01:14.800> of<00:01:15.930> sugar<00:01:18.000> and<00:01:19.000> 1<00:01:19.240> tablespoon<00:01:19.509> of<00:01:20.350> sea

00:01:20.940 --> 00:01:20.950 
a cup of sugar and 1 tablespoon of sea

00:01:20.950 --> 00:01:25.249 
a cup of sugar and 1 tablespoon of sea
salt

00:01:25.249 --> 00:01:25.259 

00:01:25.259 --> 00:01:29.749 

now<00:01:26.259> the<00:01:27.160> next<00:01:27.460> ingredient<00:01:28.119> is<00:01:28.479> white<00:01:29.259> vinegar

00:01:29.749 --> 00:01:29.759 
now the next ingredient is white vinegar

00:01:29.759 --> 00:01:32.340 
now the next ingredient is white vinegar
now<00:01:30.759> how<00:01:30.970> much<00:01:31.119> you<00:01:31.300> put<00:01:31.540> in<00:01:31.660> is<00:01:31.780> entirely<00:01:32.170> up

00:01:32.340 --> 00:01:32.350 
now how much you put in is entirely up

00:01:32.350 --> 00:01:35.340 
now how much you put in is entirely up
to<00:01:32.380> you<00:01:32.590> depends<00:01:32.979> on<00:01:33.570> how<00:01:34.570> thick<00:01:34.960> you<00:01:35.110> want<00:01:35.140> the

00:01:35.340 --> 00:01:35.350 
to you depends on how thick you want the

00:01:35.350 --> 00:01:37.710 
to you depends on how thick you want the
paste<00:01:35.649> so<00:01:36.340> it's<00:01:36.580> usually<00:01:36.759> roughly<00:01:37.390> somewhere

00:01:37.710 --> 00:01:37.720 
paste so it's usually roughly somewhere

00:01:37.720 --> 00:01:44.340 
paste so it's usually roughly somewhere
around<00:01:40.020> 1/8<00:01:41.020> of<00:01:41.410> a<00:01:41.979> cup<00:01:42.009> or<00:01:42.430> possibly<00:01:43.420> even<00:01:43.840> 1/4

00:01:44.340 --> 00:01:44.350 
around 1/8 of a cup or possibly even 1/4

00:01:44.350 --> 00:01:46.380 
around 1/8 of a cup or possibly even 1/4
of<00:01:44.560> a<00:01:44.649> cup<00:01:44.680> but<00:01:45.430> you<00:01:45.550> just<00:01:45.729> start<00:01:45.970> by<00:01:46.030> putting

00:01:46.380 --> 00:01:46.390 
of a cup but you just start by putting

00:01:46.390 --> 00:01:51.150 
of a cup but you just start by putting
in<00:01:46.600> just<00:01:46.810> a<00:01:46.899> little<00:01:46.929> bit<00:01:49.590> just<00:01:50.590> like<00:01:50.679> that<00:01:50.950> just

00:01:51.150 --> 00:01:51.160 
in just a little bit just like that just

00:01:51.160 --> 00:01:52.800 
in just a little bit just like that just
so<00:01:51.310> it<00:01:51.429> can<00:01:51.550> there's<00:01:52.390> a<00:01:52.450> bit<00:01:52.569> of<00:01:52.660> moisture

00:01:52.800 --> 00:01:52.810 
so it can there's a bit of moisture

00:01:52.810 --> 00:01:56.609 
so it can there's a bit of moisture
there<00:01:53.140> to<00:01:53.380> move<00:01:54.280> things<00:01:54.550> around<00:01:55.380> put<00:01:56.380> the<00:01:56.410> lid

00:01:56.609 --> 00:01:56.619 
there to move things around put the lid

00:01:56.619 --> 00:02:00.900 
there to move things around put the lid
on<00:01:56.649> and<00:01:56.979> turn<00:01:57.550> it<00:01:57.670> on<00:01:57.759> to<00:01:57.819> high<00:01:59.399> for<00:02:00.399> however

00:02:00.900 --> 00:02:00.910 
on and turn it on to high for however

00:02:00.910 --> 00:02:03.059 
on and turn it on to high for however
long<00:02:01.240> it<00:02:01.569> takes<00:02:01.810> to<00:02:01.959> get<00:02:02.200> this<00:02:02.410> into<00:02:02.770> a<00:02:02.800> nice

00:02:03.059 --> 00:02:03.069 
long it takes to get this into a nice

00:02:03.069 --> 00:02:05.370 
long it takes to get this into a nice
pace<00:02:03.490> and<00:02:03.729> keep<00:02:04.060> adding<00:02:04.300> white<00:02:04.750> vinegar<00:02:05.050> as

00:02:05.370 --> 00:02:05.380 
pace and keep adding white vinegar as

00:02:05.380 --> 00:02:10.440 
pace and keep adding white vinegar as
you<00:02:05.979> need<00:02:06.220> it<00:02:06.369> so<00:02:07.560> it<00:02:08.560> stays<00:02:09.060> pretty<00:02:10.060> thick

00:02:10.440 --> 00:02:10.450 
you need it so it stays pretty thick

00:02:10.450 --> 00:02:27.150 
you need it so it stays pretty thick
like<00:02:10.990> a<00:02:11.020> paste

00:02:27.150 --> 00:02:27.160 

00:02:27.160 --> 00:02:29.650 

so<00:02:28.160> you<00:02:28.250> can<00:02:28.400> just<00:02:28.550> pull<00:02:28.850> this<00:02:29.000> straight<00:02:29.330> into

00:02:29.650 --> 00:02:29.660 
so you can just pull this straight into

00:02:29.660 --> 00:02:39.580 
so you can just pull this straight into
a<00:02:29.980> jar<00:02:30.980> and<00:02:35.290> store<00:02:36.290> it<00:02:38.140> but<00:02:39.140> I<00:02:39.170> certainly

00:02:39.580 --> 00:02:39.590 
a jar and store it but I certainly

00:02:39.590 --> 00:02:42.330 
a jar and store it but I certainly
wouldn't<00:02:40.070> recommend<00:02:40.220> using<00:02:40.820> this<00:02:41.090> as<00:02:41.300> a<00:02:41.330> dip

00:02:42.330 --> 00:02:42.340 
wouldn't recommend using this as a dip

00:02:42.340 --> 00:02:47.020 
wouldn't recommend using this as a dip
because<00:02:43.340> it's<00:02:43.840> very<00:02:44.840> very<00:02:45.500> hot<00:02:45.920> extremely<00:02:46.700> hot

00:02:47.020 --> 00:02:47.030 
because it's very very hot extremely hot

00:02:47.030 --> 00:02:50.440 
because it's very very hot extremely hot
well<00:02:47.270> I<00:02:47.300> hope<00:02:47.450> you<00:02:47.600> enjoyed<00:02:47.990> this<00:02:48.200> hot<00:02:49.450> very

00:02:50.450 --> 00:02:55.510 
well I hope you enjoyed this hot very
hot<00:02:51.220> chili<00:02:52.220> paste<00:02:52.880> now<00:02:53.210> I<00:02:53.530> do<00:02:54.530> suggest<00:02:55.160> that

00:02:55.510 --> 00:02:55.520 
hot chili paste now I do suggest that

00:02:55.520 --> 00:02:59.320 
hot chili paste now I do suggest that
you<00:02:55.640> add<00:02:55.880> this<00:02:56.150> as<00:02:56.480> a<00:02:57.350> paste<00:02:57.830> to<00:02:58.730> an<00:02:59.000> actual

00:02:59.320 --> 00:02:59.330 
you add this as a paste to an actual

00:02:59.330 --> 00:03:01.930 
you add this as a paste to an actual
meal<00:02:59.800> with<00:03:00.800> whatever<00:03:01.160> else<00:03:01.430> you're<00:03:01.580> cooking

00:03:01.930 --> 00:03:01.940 
meal with whatever else you're cooking

00:03:01.940 --> 00:03:03.490
