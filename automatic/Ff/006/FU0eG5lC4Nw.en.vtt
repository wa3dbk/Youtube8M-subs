few<00:00:58.260> pieces<00:00:58.469> left<00:00:58.829> over<00:01:00.379> so<00:01:01.379> I<00:01:01.410> cut<00:01:01.829> a<00:01:01.859> piece<00:01:01.949> to

00:01:02.299 --> 00:01:02.309

00:01:02.309 --> 00:01:05.810 
few pieces left over so I cut a piece to
size<00:01:02.719> painted<00:01:03.719> it<00:01:03.870> black<00:01:04.199> and<00:01:04.500> placed<00:01:05.430> it<00:01:05.790> in

00:01:13.670 --> 00:01:13.680 
front of the back panel of the unit so

00:01:13.680 --> 00:01:15.350 
front of the back panel of the unit so
since<00:01:14.010> there<00:01:14.220> was<00:01:14.369> an<00:01:14.520> electrical<00:01:15.150> outlet

00:01:15.350 --> 00:01:15.360

00:01:15.360 --> 00:01:18.020 
since there was an electrical outlet
inside<00:01:16.110> the<00:01:16.350> cabinet<00:01:16.830> I<00:01:17.040> thought<00:01:17.549> it<00:01:17.700> might<00:01:17.850> be

00:01:18.020 --> 00:01:18.030 
inside the cabinet I thought it might be

00:01:18.030 --> 00:01:20.450 
inside the cabinet I thought it might be
a<00:01:18.060> great<00:01:18.330> idea<00:01:18.390> to<00:01:18.869> add<00:01:18.900> some<00:01:19.439> lights<00:01:19.770> in<00:01:20.070> the

00:01:20.450 --> 00:01:20.460 
a great idea to add some lights in the

00:01:20.460 --> 00:01:23.359 
a great idea to add some lights in the
ceiling<00:01:20.790> of<00:01:21.119> the<00:01:21.240> cabinet<00:01:21.780> so<00:01:22.710> I<00:01:22.740> got<00:01:23.130> these

00:01:23.359 --> 00:01:23.369 
ceiling of the cabinet so I got these

00:01:23.369 --> 00:01:26.090 
ceiling of the cabinet so I got these
three<00:01:23.850> connected<00:01:24.570> plug-in<00:01:25.080> lights<00:01:25.380> that<00:01:25.860> had

00:01:26.090 --> 00:01:26.100

adhesive<00:01:26.759> on<00:01:26.939> the<00:01:27.060> back<00:01:27.240> and<00:01:27.570> stuck<00:01:28.259> them<00:01:28.560> to

00:01:28.940 --> 00:01:28.950
