really cool video to go along with it so
in<00:00:25.500> this<00:00:25.590> is<00:00:25.680> where<00:00:25.800> I'm<00:00:25.859> going<00:00:25.980> to<00:00:26.039> show<00:00:26.160> you

in this is where I'm going to show you
guys<00:00:26.430> just<00:00:26.460> how<00:00:26.880> we<00:00:26.939> create<00:00:27.330> the<00:00:27.420> final<00:00:27.779> look

00:00:27.890 --> 00:00:27.900 
guys just how we create the final look

00:00:27.900 --> 00:00:29.630 
guys just how we create the final look
that<00:00:27.960> you<00:00:28.170> see<00:00:28.199> here<00:00:28.590> now<00:00:29.039> it's<00:00:29.189> kind<00:00:29.340> of<00:00:29.400> silly

00:00:29.630 --> 00:00:29.640 
that you see here now it's kind of silly

00:00:29.640 --> 00:00:31.370 
that you see here now it's kind of silly
but<00:00:29.820> the<00:00:29.939> majority<00:00:30.390> of<00:00:30.539> our<00:00:30.689> budget<00:00:31.019> actually

00:00:31.370 --> 00:00:31.380 
but the majority of our budget actually

00:00:31.380 --> 00:00:33.440 
but the majority of our budget actually
went<00:00:31.590> into<00:00:31.769> just<00:00:32.460> creating<00:00:32.850> the<00:00:32.940> background

00:00:33.440 --> 00:00:33.450 
went into just creating the background

00:00:33.450 --> 00:00:36.530 
went into just creating the background
wall<00:00:33.780> for<00:00:34.500> our<00:00:34.590> set<00:00:34.890> we<00:00:35.430> got<00:00:35.579> these<00:00:35.820> little

00:00:36.530 --> 00:00:36.540 
wall for our set we got these little

00:00:36.540 --> 00:00:39.500 
wall for our set we got these little
tiles<00:00:37.020> off<00:00:37.469> of<00:00:37.739> inhabit<00:00:38.670> but<00:00:39.149> they're<00:00:39.300> really

00:00:39.500 --> 00:00:39.510 
tiles off of inhabit but they're really

00:00:39.510 --> 00:00:40.970 
tiles off of inhabit but they're really
cool<00:00:39.629> all<00:00:39.899> we<00:00:40.020> did<00:00:40.140> was<00:00:40.290> we<00:00:40.410> took<00:00:40.559> these<00:00:40.710> we

00:00:40.970 --> 00:00:40.980 
cool all we did was we took these we

00:00:40.980 --> 00:00:43.990 
cool all we did was we took these we
attach<00:00:41.309> them<00:00:41.489> to<00:00:41.670> the<00:00:41.790> wall<00:00:41.930> just<00:00:42.930> be<00:00:43.050> a<00:00:43.079> little

00:00:43.990 --> 00:00:44.000 
attach them to the wall just be a little

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:46.190 
attach them to the wall just be a little
basically<00:00:45.000> like<00:00:45.180> double<00:00:45.450> sided<00:00:45.629> tape<00:00:45.750> and<00:00:46.140> you

00:00:46.190 --> 00:00:46.200 
basically like double sided tape and you

00:00:46.200 --> 00:00:47.750 
basically like double sided tape and you
just<00:00:46.379> put<00:00:46.770> it<00:00:46.860> in<00:00:46.890> the<00:00:47.010> four<00:00:47.190> corners<00:00:47.430> and<00:00:47.579> then

00:00:47.750 --> 00:00:47.760 
just put it in the four corners and then

00:00:47.760 --> 00:00:49.250 
just put it in the four corners and then
put<00:00:48.270> it<00:00:48.360> right<00:00:48.390> on<00:00:48.600> the<00:00:48.660> wall<00:00:48.840> as<00:00:48.930> you<00:00:49.020> see<00:00:49.140> me

00:00:49.250 --> 00:00:49.260 
put it right on the wall as you see me

00:00:49.260 --> 00:00:51.740 
put it right on the wall as you see me
doing<00:00:49.379> here<00:00:49.730> now<00:00:50.730> once<00:00:51.059> I<00:00:51.149> basically<00:00:51.449> had<00:00:51.629> this

00:00:51.740 --> 00:00:51.750 
doing here now once I basically had this

00:00:51.750 --> 00:00:53.299 
doing here now once I basically had this
scene<00:00:51.989> set<00:00:52.230> up<00:00:52.379> I<00:00:52.559> brought<00:00:52.800> in<00:00:52.920> my<00:00:53.010> lighting

00:00:53.299 --> 00:00:53.309 
scene set up I brought in my lighting

00:00:53.309 --> 00:00:54.619 
scene set up I brought in my lighting
dummy<00:00:53.489> I<00:00:53.730> always<00:00:53.969> use<00:00:54.090> the<00:00:54.180> lighting<00:00:54.420> dummy

00:00:54.619 --> 00:00:54.629 
dummy I always use the lighting dummy

00:00:54.629 --> 00:00:56.209 
dummy I always use the lighting dummy
because<00:00:54.840> I<00:00:54.930> want<00:00:55.079> to<00:00:55.140> see<00:00:55.320> how<00:00:55.590> the<00:00:55.649> light<00:00:56.070> is

00:00:56.209 --> 00:00:56.219 
because I want to see how the light is

00:00:56.219 --> 00:00:57.560 
because I want to see how the light is
being<00:00:56.399> shaped<00:00:56.699> around<00:00:56.879> my<00:00:57.000> model<00:00:57.329> and<00:00:57.480> I<00:00:57.539> don't

00:00:57.560 --> 00:00:57.570 
being shaped around my model and I don't

00:00:57.570 --> 00:00:58.970 
being shaped around my model and I don't
want<00:00:57.809> to<00:00:57.870> go<00:00:57.960> get<00:00:58.170> somebody<00:00:58.469> to<00:00:58.590> sit<00:00:58.770> there<00:00:58.920> and

00:00:58.970 --> 00:00:58.980 
want to go get somebody to sit there and

00:00:58.980 --> 00:01:00.500 
want to go get somebody to sit there and
the<00:00:59.489> entire<00:00:59.760> time<00:01:00.000> while<00:01:00.149> I'm<00:01:00.300> kind<00:01:00.480> of

00:01:00.500 --> 00:01:00.510 
the entire time while I'm kind of

00:01:00.510 --> 00:01:02.119 
the entire time while I'm kind of
shaping<00:01:00.840> the<00:01:00.870> light<00:01:01.079> so<00:01:01.739> I<00:01:01.800> bring<00:01:01.980> in<00:01:02.100> my

00:01:02.119 --> 00:01:02.129 
shaping the light so I bring in my

00:01:02.129 --> 00:01:03.860 
shaping the light so I bring in my
lighting<00:01:02.489> dummy<00:01:02.730> and<00:01:02.879> then<00:01:03.420> we<00:01:03.510> go<00:01:03.629> on<00:01:03.660> to

00:01:03.860 --> 00:01:03.870 
lighting dummy and then we go on to

00:01:03.870 --> 00:01:05.690 
lighting dummy and then we go on to
basically<00:01:04.110> wiring<00:01:04.530> the<00:01:04.619> entire<00:01:04.830> set<00:01:05.159> now

00:01:05.690 --> 00:01:05.700 
basically wiring the entire set now

00:01:05.700 --> 00:01:07.910 
basically wiring the entire set now
where<00:01:06.150> I<00:01:06.180> place<00:01:06.600> the<00:01:06.810> wood<00:01:07.020> basically<00:01:07.680> there

00:01:07.910 --> 00:01:07.920 
where I place the wood basically there

00:01:07.920 --> 00:01:09.410 
where I place the wood basically there
is<00:01:07.950> a<00:01:08.070> little<00:01:08.490> tiny<00:01:08.729> like<00:01:09.060> the<00:01:09.180> wood<00:01:09.330> is

00:01:09.410 --> 00:01:09.420 
is a little tiny like the wood is

00:01:09.420 --> 00:01:11.179 
is a little tiny like the wood is
basically<00:01:09.659> elevated<00:01:10.110> a<00:01:10.140> little<00:01:10.350> bit<00:01:10.470> and<00:01:10.680> so

00:01:11.179 --> 00:01:11.189 
basically elevated a little bit and so

00:01:11.189 --> 00:01:12.859 
basically elevated a little bit and so
when<00:01:11.369> I<00:01:11.400> place<00:01:11.670> the<00:01:11.700> wiring<00:01:12.240> all<00:01:12.479> I'm<00:01:12.570> doing<00:01:12.780> is

00:01:12.859 --> 00:01:12.869 
when I place the wiring all I'm doing is

00:01:12.869 --> 00:01:14.660 
when I place the wiring all I'm doing is
I'm<00:01:12.990> pulling<00:01:13.320> that<00:01:13.500> kind<00:01:14.340> of<00:01:14.369> that<00:01:14.490> wood

00:01:14.660 --> 00:01:14.670 
I'm pulling that kind of that wood

00:01:14.670 --> 00:01:16.100 
I'm pulling that kind of that wood
flooring<00:01:14.909> off<00:01:15.150> the<00:01:15.330> background<00:01:15.750> just<00:01:15.810> a<00:01:15.900> tiny

00:01:16.100 --> 00:01:16.110 
flooring off the background just a tiny

00:01:16.110 --> 00:01:18.140 
flooring off the background just a tiny
bit<00:01:16.320> and<00:01:16.470> then<00:01:16.950> just<00:01:16.979> tucking<00:01:17.520> it<00:01:17.610> in<00:01:17.850> where

00:01:18.140 --> 00:01:18.150 
bit and then just tucking it in where

00:01:18.150 --> 00:01:20.390 
bit and then just tucking it in where
there's<00:01:18.360> that<00:01:18.570> little<00:01:18.960> groove<00:01:19.320> between<00:01:19.979> that

00:01:20.390 --> 00:01:20.400 
there's that little groove between that

00:01:20.400 --> 00:01:21.800 
there's that little groove between that
and<00:01:20.580> the<00:01:20.670> wall<00:01:20.850> so<00:01:21.090> that<00:01:21.210> you<00:01:21.299> can't<00:01:21.540> see<00:01:21.720> the

00:01:21.800 --> 00:01:21.810 
and the wall so that you can't see the

00:01:21.810 --> 00:01:23.660 
and the wall so that you can't see the
wiring<00:01:22.020> that<00:01:22.740> way<00:01:22.830> on<00:01:22.950> any<00:01:23.070> of<00:01:23.250> our<00:01:23.340> wider

00:01:23.660 --> 00:01:23.670 
wiring that way on any of our wider

00:01:23.670 --> 00:01:25.130 
wiring that way on any of our wider
shots<00:01:24.060> basically<00:01:24.540> you<00:01:24.600> won't<00:01:24.750> be<00:01:24.810> able<00:01:24.869> to<00:01:24.960> see

00:01:25.130 --> 00:01:25.140 
shots basically you won't be able to see

00:01:25.140 --> 00:01:30.100 
shots basically you won't be able to see

00:03:12.100 --> 00:03:12.110 
set it up just as a rim light so we're

00:03:12.110 --> 00:03:13.720 
set it up just as a rim light so we're
putting<00:03:12.320> it<00:03:12.410> on<00:03:12.440> the<00:03:12.560> ground<00:03:12.860> it's<00:03:13.489> just<00:03:13.549> going

00:03:39.030 --> 00:03:39.040 
you can see it in kind of the right side

00:03:39.040 --> 00:03:40.590 
you can see it in kind of the right side
of<00:03:39.100> the<00:03:39.160> frame<00:03:39.340> right<00:03:39.550> there<00:03:39.580> we're<00:03:40.330> doing

00:03:40.590 --> 00:03:40.600 
of the frame right there we're doing

00:03:40.600 --> 00:03:42.330 
of the frame right there we're doing
we're<00:03:41.080> shooting<00:03:41.440> it<00:03:41.530> from<00:03:41.680> high<00:03:41.830> to<00:03:41.890> low<00:03:42.010> just

00:03:42.330 --> 00:03:42.340 
we're shooting it from high to low just

00:03:42.340 --> 00:03:44.460 
we're shooting it from high to low just
kind<00:03:42.700> of<00:03:42.760> has<00:03:42.880> a<00:03:42.910> realistic<00:03:43.450> feel<00:03:43.480> we're

00:03:44.460 --> 00:03:44.470 
kind of has a realistic feel we're

00:03:44.470 --> 00:03:45.810 
kind of has a realistic feel we're
setting<00:03:44.770> it<00:03:44.800> up<00:03:44.890> high<00:03:45.070> so<00:03:45.340> that<00:03:45.370> it<00:03:45.550> goes<00:03:45.640> from

00:03:45.810 --> 00:03:45.820 
setting it up high so that it goes from

00:03:45.820 --> 00:03:47.370 
setting it up high so that it goes from
high<00:03:45.970> to<00:03:46.000> low<00:03:46.180> just<00:03:46.900> kind<00:03:47.110> of<00:03:47.140> create<00:03:47.350> a

00:03:47.370 --> 00:03:47.380 
high to low just kind of create a

00:03:47.380 --> 00:03:49.620 
high to low just kind of create a
realistic<00:03:47.710> look<00:03:48.040> to<00:03:48.190> our<00:03:48.280> light<00:03:48.490> we<00:03:48.790> also<00:03:48.940> want

00:03:49.620 --> 00:03:49.630 
realistic look to our light we also want

00:03:49.630 --> 00:03:50.970 
realistic look to our light we also want
to<00:03:49.660> prevent<00:03:50.050> the<00:03:50.200> majority<00:03:50.590> of<00:03:50.620> this<00:03:50.740> from

00:03:50.970 --> 00:03:50.980 
to prevent the majority of this from

00:03:50.980 --> 00:03:52.920 
to prevent the majority of this from
hitting<00:03:51.190> the<00:03:51.280> background<00:03:51.820> so<00:03:52.360> I<00:03:52.390> am<00:03:52.600> putting

00:03:52.920 --> 00:03:52.930 
hitting the background so I am putting

00:03:52.930 --> 00:03:54.900 
hitting the background so I am putting
on<00:03:53.110> again<00:03:53.740> another<00:03:53.950> gobo<00:03:54.400> on<00:03:54.550> there<00:03:54.760> so<00:03:54.880> that

00:03:54.900 --> 00:03:54.910 
on again another gobo on there so that

00:03:54.910 --> 00:03:56.370 
on again another gobo on there so that
it<00:03:55.060> doesn't<00:03:55.150> hit<00:03:55.630> and<00:03:55.930> wash<00:03:56.170> out<00:03:56.350> the

00:03:56.370 --> 00:03:56.380 
it doesn't hit and wash out the

00:03:56.380 --> 00:03:58.230 
it doesn't hit and wash out the
background<00:03:56.620> too<00:03:56.980> much<00:03:57.190> now<00:03:57.790> I'm<00:03:57.850> gonna<00:03:57.940> set<00:03:58.210> up

00:03:58.230 --> 00:03:58.240 
background too much now I'm gonna set up

00:03:58.240 --> 00:04:00.150 
background too much now I'm gonna set up
a<00:03:58.420> basic<00:03:58.660> scrim<00:03:59.230> just<00:03:59.560> right<00:03:59.770> in<00:03:59.890> front<00:04:00.100> of

00:04:00.150 --> 00:04:00.160 
a basic scrim just right in front of

a basic scrim just right in front of
that<00:04:00.250> light<00:04:00.550> just<00:04:00.790> to<00:04:00.850> kind<00:04:01.030> of<00:04:01.090> soften<00:04:01.480> the

00:04:01.620 --> 00:04:01.630 
that light just to kind of soften the

all we did for these was we brought in a
white<00:05:09.370> glass<00:05:09.669> table<00:05:10.120> and<00:05:10.300> that's<00:05:10.540> what<00:05:10.780> kind

00:05:10.950 --> 00:05:10.960 
white glass table and that's what kind

00:05:12.840 --> 00:05:12.850 
of creates that reflection it reflects

00:05:12.850 --> 00:05:13.920 
of creates that reflection it reflects
the<00:05:12.970> background<00:05:13.360> and<00:05:13.450> gives<00:05:13.570> it<00:05:13.660> a<00:05:13.690> really

00:05:13.920 --> 00:05:13.930 
the background and gives it a really

00:05:13.930 --> 00:05:16.230 
the background and gives it a really
nice<00:05:14.050> look<00:05:14.110> to<00:05:14.380> it<00:05:14.640> but<00:05:15.640> basically<00:05:15.730> the<00:05:16.000> exact

00:05:16.230 --> 00:05:16.240 
nice look to it but basically the exact

00:05:16.240 --> 00:05:18.120 
nice look to it but basically the exact
same<00:05:16.390> light<00:05:16.630> we<00:05:17.169> are<00:05:17.350> able<00:05:17.560> to<00:05:17.710> do<00:05:17.890> a<00:05:17.919> little

00:05:18.120 --> 00:05:18.130 
same light we are able to do a little

00:05:18.130 --> 00:05:19.650 
same light we are able to do a little
more<00:05:18.220> tweaking<00:05:18.610> we<00:05:18.730> shot<00:05:18.940> these<00:05:19.060> Roger<00:05:19.330> so<00:05:19.570> we

00:05:19.650 --> 00:05:19.660 
more tweaking we shot these Roger so we

00:05:19.660 --> 00:05:21.030 
more tweaking we shot these Roger so we
can<00:05:19.780> kind<00:05:19.930> of<00:05:19.960> balance<00:05:20.140> out<00:05:20.440> the<00:05:20.680> light<00:05:20.890> and

00:05:21.030 --> 00:05:21.040 
can kind of balance out the light and

00:05:21.040 --> 00:05:22.830 
can kind of balance out the light and
everything<00:05:21.130> in<00:05:21.580> post<00:05:22.300> so<00:05:22.450> hopefully<00:05:22.720> you<00:05:22.780> guys
