00:00:38.399 --> 00:00:41.850
 see granny a comment in the

 presentation will be missed and told me I 

00:00:41.850 --> 00:00:45.469
 would do it 

00:00:43.480 --> 00:00:47.120
 everywhere the characters are wandering because 

00:00:45.469 --> 00:00:49.710
 malus of the skin would net so 

00:00:47.120 --> 00:00:51.050
 not certain traits 10 years yesterday 

00:00:49.710 --> 00:00:53.239

 see I bought this trophy so has to 

00:00:55.579 --> 00:01:02.050
 pm retirement always advantageous when 

00:00:58.840 --> 00:01:04.050
 with the slowing arrow I sort 

00:01:02.050 --> 00:01:07.350

00:01:04.050 --> 00:01:08.340
 in short we do not care and but not the trophy 

00:01:07.350 --> 00:01:10.950
 I bought it's the pest t in 

00:01:08.340 --> 00:01:13.530
 minor that allows me to type a small 

00:01:10.950 --> 00:01:15.440
 little more so then at the level of the 

00:01:13.530 --> 00:01:17.420
 to say koi no so I always kept 

00:01:15.440 --> 00:01:20.060
 the royal hairstyle of another sixty 

00:01:17.420 --> 00:01:22.640
 ten earth and yes I bought a new 

00:01:20.060 --> 00:01:23.720
 so cake bakool mane 

00:01:22.640 --> 00:01:25.970
 so this is the first time I have 

00:01:23.720 --> 00:01:30.110
 see it's psycho who told me go 

00:01:25.970 --> 00:01:31.640
 take there was not bad 1 inches core you 

00:01:30.110 --> 00:01:33.440
 do not want to take the daggerfall will take 

00:01:31.640 --> 00:01:36.710
 that so I took that I listened to it 

00:01:33.440 --> 00:01:38.210
 is in fact trusting then the 

00:01:36.710 --> 00:01:41.270
 jul rings as under level 60 

00:01:38.210 --> 00:01:43.010
 I saw I'm here so 118 to and his 

00:01:41.270 --> 00:01:45.740
 camp I take I start with first 

00:01:43.010 --> 00:01:47.690
 throw this one 256 indicative but 

00:01:45.740 --> 00:01:50.210
 I had already spoken in the presentation 

00:01:47.690 --> 00:01:52.610
 trap at the cellar I kept 

00:01:50.210 --> 00:01:55.190
 the same at the level of the dd I took the 

00:01:52.610 --> 00:01:57.260
 same as that of my fact so that 

00:01:55.190 --> 00:01:58.490
 now we will go to building where this 

00:01:57.260 --> 00:02:01.370
 source everything is that the evil that I 

00:01:58.490 --> 00:02:04.900
 changed so there I kept I took 

00:02:01.370 --> 00:02:07.070
 boots to brax vote so fm of 60 force 

00:02:04.900 --> 00:02:08.929
 then the chafes belt so he 

00:02:07.070 --> 00:02:10.040
 needed cc and force and 

00:02:08.929 --> 00:02:12.890
 the habitat that would be good 

00:02:10.040 --> 00:02:14.780
 best I took this one then I 

00:02:12.890 --> 00:02:17.660
 took the name of the calacs for vita and 

00:02:14.780 --> 00:02:19.489
 from peace to and from fire resistance and 

00:02:17.660 --> 00:02:23.930
 Then I took the kama pussy 

00:02:19.489 --> 00:02:27.780
 sutra therefore a pea and 104 vitality and 

00:02:23.930 --> 00:02:31.700
 so here's the panoply 

00:02:27.780 --> 00:02:31.700
 I do not see what else I can say 

00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:36.750
 well we'll cut like that becomes a 

00:02:34.319 --> 00:02:39.390
 little bit of which and I tell you to everything from 

00:02:36.750 --> 00:02:41.300
 suite and well everyone and here you go 

00:02:39.390 --> 00:02:43.620
 we found the cohesion fight are 

00:02:41.300 --> 00:02:45.209
 so 

00:02:43.620 --> 00:02:49.230
 I'm going to put a tactical mode for 

00:02:45.209 --> 00:02:51.120
 to see better is better my tactics for 

00:02:49.230 --> 00:02:54.269
 the best and the scenery as we are 

00:02:51.120 --> 00:02:56.489
 in a in a bar if I can say we 

00:02:54.269 --> 00:03:00.599
 will say that a bar a little chelou I 

00:02:56.489 --> 00:03:04.769
 so we're going to stay fair play a 

00:03:00.599 --> 00:03:11.129
 like in this part to peck say 

00:03:04.769 --> 00:03:14.310
 hello mr break language and see you are 

00:03:11.129 --> 00:03:16.970

00:03:14.310 --> 00:03:16.970
 put there my 

00:03:18.870 --> 00:03:24.720
 yeah I put it here so go ahead of them 

00:03:23.190 --> 00:03:27.629
 psycho I leave present here 

00:03:24.720 --> 00:03:29.310
 you have a suicide I find that I 

00:03:27.629 --> 00:03:31.290
 find it not too much to do more often 

00:03:29.310 --> 00:03:33.060
 because we are still expecting a lot 

00:03:31.290 --> 00:03:35.730
 someone to find a fight and bah 

00:03:33.060 --> 00:03:37.650
 that's the advantage for us but 

00:03:35.730 --> 00:03:39.540
 it's not very funny for me what 

00:03:37.650 --> 00:03:42.060
 I mean is that you are a 

00:03:39.540 --> 00:03:43.890
 wish must not get excited for a game for 

00:03:42.060 --> 00:03:48.030
 the decline as hervÃ© papin that's for sure 

00:03:43.890 --> 00:03:49.739

00:03:48.030 --> 00:03:51.450
 evasive I will introduce myself banid 

00:03:49.739 --> 00:03:54.329
 the two people who stay in the 

00:03:51.450 --> 00:03:55.560
 line in front and psycho lightly on 

00:03:54.329 --> 00:03:57.299
 go back our team 

00:03:55.560 --> 00:03:59.970

00:03:57.299 --> 00:04:02.190

00:04:06.390 --> 00:04:15.239
 the better you can pass the team in 

00:04:09.030 --> 00:04:19.350

00:04:28.650 --> 00:04:35.180
 my sisters how is my turn 

00:04:30.590 --> 00:04:37.300

00:04:37.300 --> 00:04:42.539
 I put it a scatter here 

00:04:43.070 --> 00:04:46.730
 is sic yes we look at the resistance of 

00:04:46.190 --> 00:04:48.860
 the hatch 

00:04:46.730 --> 00:04:55.490
 oh yeah that's what I said I believe 

00:04:48.860 --> 00:04:58.750
 that I have grasped one shot kind of shot 

00:04:55.490 --> 00:04:58.750
 up to +1 

00:05:06.449 --> 00:05:11.040

 loved him there, that's why we are 167 

00:05:26.540 --> 00:05:32.110
 it's okay I think it's okay for a 

00:05:29.810 --> 00:05:36.080
 level for the first and then I find 

00:05:32.110 --> 00:05:37.190

00:05:36.080 --> 00:05:42.830

 I can still a beautiful beautiful woman 

00:06:57.940 --> 00:07:03.940

00:07:03.940 --> 00:07:08.020
 adverse land credit will redeem

00:07:24.919 --> 00:07:34.459
 shot from afar if I have a supporter this 

00:07:28.969 --> 00:07:39.319
 would be cool nickel and that's a good shot 

00:07:34.459 --> 00:07:41.209
