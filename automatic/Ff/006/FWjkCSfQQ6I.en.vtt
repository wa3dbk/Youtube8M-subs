00:00:47.270 --> 00:00:47.280 
years ago and I discovered how to style

00:00:47.280 --> 00:00:50.259 
years ago and I discovered how to style
it<00:00:47.460> properly<00:00:47.850> about<00:00:48.239> a<00:00:48.300> year<00:00:48.600> into<00:00:48.750> the<00:00:48.960> Hat<00:00:49.140> so

00:00:50.259 --> 00:00:50.269 
it properly about a year into the Hat so

00:00:50.269 --> 00:00:52.579 
it properly about a year into the Hat so
for<00:00:51.269> a<00:00:51.330> year<00:00:51.570> you<00:00:51.690> know<00:00:51.809> I<00:00:51.839> was<00:00:52.050> using<00:00:52.260> the

00:00:52.579 --> 00:00:52.589 
for a year you know I was using the

00:00:52.589 --> 00:00:54.799 
for a year you know I was using the
round<00:00:52.800> brush<00:00:52.979> and<00:00:53.339> the<00:00:53.400> hairdryer<00:00:53.760> and<00:00:54.180> it<00:00:54.629> was

00:00:54.799 --> 00:00:54.809 
round brush and the hairdryer and it was

00:00:54.809 --> 00:00:56.689 
round brush and the hairdryer and it was
just<00:00:54.960> taking<00:00:55.229> way<00:00:55.350> too<00:00:55.379> long<00:00:55.710> and<00:00:56.159> it<00:00:56.370> didn't

00:00:56.689 --> 00:00:56.699 
just taking way too long and it didn't

00:00:56.699 --> 00:00:58.850 
just taking way too long and it didn't
look<00:00:56.820> right<00:00:57.030> and<00:00:57.420> then<00:00:58.140> I<00:00:58.229> finally<00:00:58.470> figured

00:00:58.850 --> 00:00:58.860 
look right and then I finally figured

00:00:58.860 --> 00:01:00.979

00:03:45.390 --> 00:03:45.400 
that a little bit so that you're not

00:03:45.400 --> 00:03:46.949
