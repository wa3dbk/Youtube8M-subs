00:00:03.710 --> 00:00:12.000
 of ingredients is the new section in 

00:00:08.880 --> 00:00:13.889
 the one youtube twitteros of renown 

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:16.170
 the weight centers of the real ones that 

00:00:13.889 --> 00:00:17.760
 they have ways that challenge with two 

00:00:16.170 --> 00:00:18.990
 ingredients the ingredients with the 

00:00:17.760 --> 00:00:20.910
 that I have to build a recipe 

00:00:18.990 --> 00:00:22.980
 there is the possibility that some 

00:00:20.910 --> 00:00:27.090
 fucking they are the first to send me 

00:00:22.980 --> 00:00:29.970
 video adrián pino a that was very crazy 

00:00:27.090 --> 00:00:31.890
 very fucked from the head actor adrián 

00:00:29.970 --> 00:00:33.750
 from the good ones you already see combat watching 

00:00:31.890 --> 00:00:35.340
 first seen in flame everything that touches 

00:00:33.750 --> 00:00:36.780
 they would say turns it into laughter before 

00:00:35.340 --> 00:00:38.050
 nothing we will see the challenge that I 

00:00:36.780 --> 00:00:41.489
 I pose 

00:00:38.050 --> 00:00:44.170
 and how about the edge because I want 

00:00:41.489 --> 00:00:47.110
 propose clear a recipe with two 

00:00:44.170 --> 00:00:49.480
 ingredients onion and sugar but that 

00:00:47.110 --> 00:00:53.250
 make a recipe with onion 

00:00:49.480 --> 00:00:57.790
 caramelized to see what you can do with 

00:00:53.250 --> 00:00:59.079
 success since they're going to make infinity that 

00:00:57.790 --> 00:01:01.210
 you have taken the trouble to be the 

00:00:59.079 --> 00:01:02.650
 first to send the video and also that 

00:01:01.210 --> 00:01:04.600
 you have moved to the studios 

00:01:02.650 --> 00:01:06.750
 from tell me to record it to cook 

00:01:04.600 --> 00:01:06.750
 inside 

00:01:08.829 --> 00:01:14.210
 and we are going to cook a hamburger and that 

00:01:12.469 --> 00:01:16.789
 has what a new concept 

00:01:14.210 --> 00:01:18.500
 surprising and interesting electrifying 

00:01:16.789 --> 00:01:21.460
 come on, I do not have time to explain 

00:01:18.500 --> 00:01:21.460
 before they start in 

00:01:33.939 --> 00:01:37.999
 Let's make homemade bread, we'll fill it 

00:01:36.439 --> 00:01:41.210
 with the ingredients and then they will come out 

00:01:37.999 --> 00:01:43.189
 our hamburgers and we mix in a 

00:01:41.210 --> 00:01:46.159
 All the solid ingredients are 

00:01:43.189 --> 00:01:47.780
 say normal flour strength flour and 

00:01:46.159 --> 00:01:49.969
 the sugar you already know that the quantities 

00:01:47.780 --> 00:01:51.439
 you have them at the beginning of the video or in 

00:01:49.969 --> 00:01:54.950
 his description on youtube in a bowl 

00:01:51.439 --> 00:01:56.780
 apart we mix milk water a new and 

00:01:54.950 --> 00:01:58.250
 we crumble the yeast now we mix 

00:01:56.780 --> 00:01:59.750
 the solid ingredients with the 

00:01:58.250 --> 00:02:01.280
 liquids until obtaining a mass that 

00:01:59.750 --> 00:02:03.560
 we can work with hands after 

00:02:01.280 --> 00:02:05.539
 of a death fight with the mass os 

00:02:03.560 --> 00:02:07.549
 will be a beautiful little ball that we are going to 

00:02:05.539 --> 00:02:09.170
 put in your goal and when painting with a little 

00:02:07.549 --> 00:02:11.269
 of oil is only covered with a 

00:02:09.170 --> 00:02:13.610
 dishcloth and let stand one 

00:02:11.269 --> 00:02:16.890
 time in a cool place and not worth in the 

00:02:13.610 --> 00:02:19.980
 fridge I said cool not cold 

00:02:16.890 --> 00:02:21.330
 let's caramelize onion first 

00:02:19.980 --> 00:02:22.920
 we cut the onion in julienne or 

00:02:21.330 --> 00:02:24.510
 tubs for us to understand now 

00:02:22.920 --> 00:02:26.520
 we support the onion in abundant oil 

00:02:24.510 --> 00:02:28.620
 and on medium heat until it is 

00:02:26.520 --> 00:02:32.250
 softness and semi transparent we add the 

00:02:28.620 --> 00:02:34.020
 brown sugar and vinegar do not have 

00:02:32.250 --> 00:02:36.900
 Hurry with this has to be on fire 

00:02:34.020 --> 00:02:38.490
 gradually slow if the whole or the 

00:02:36.900 --> 00:02:40.550
 result should be something like 

00:02:38.490 --> 00:02:40.550
 this 

00:02:43.819 --> 00:02:46.810
 good 

00:02:48.270 --> 00:02:52.560
 you remember the little ball of dough 

00:02:50.040 --> 00:02:54.330
 now it's the super mass of living your 

00:02:52.560 --> 00:02:55.860
 hands let's give it a couple of laps 

00:02:54.330 --> 00:02:59.140
 to get rid of air bubbles 

00:02:55.860 --> 00:03:01.270
 that have been created and we reserve it 

00:02:59.140 --> 00:03:02.680
 salt and pepper to taste in a good 

00:03:01.270 --> 00:03:04.030
 butcher meat 

00:03:02.680 --> 00:03:05.319
 if you can avoid the one that comes 

00:03:04.030 --> 00:03:07.600
 packaged in supermarkets 

00:03:05.319 --> 00:03:09.280
 much better using a mold to 

00:03:07.600 --> 00:03:11.200
 burgers we shape the first 

00:03:09.280 --> 00:03:13.000
 layer of cable we put in the center a 

00:03:11.200 --> 00:03:15.860
 good philadelphia cheese ball and 

00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:18.430
 We close with a second layer of meat 

00:03:15.860 --> 00:03:18.430
 do not 

00:03:22.960 --> 00:03:25.960
 Solomon 

00:03:26.300 --> 00:03:29.690
 this is an intimate moment leave me alone 

00:03:28.520 --> 00:03:31.100
 with my hamburgers 

00:03:29.690 --> 00:03:32.870
 Now that we have our wonders 

00:03:31.100 --> 00:03:34.550
 meat we are going to fill the bread with 

00:03:32.870 --> 00:03:36.530
 they stretch the dough I have used 

00:03:34.550 --> 00:03:38.180
 a glass but sane people use a 

00:03:36.530 --> 00:03:40.190
 kitchen roll and place the 

00:03:38.180 --> 00:03:42.110
 burger right in the middle we crowned 

00:03:40.190 --> 00:03:44.270
 our mountain of flavors with our 

00:03:42.110 --> 00:03:46.280
 caramelized onions and sealed with the 

00:03:44.270 --> 00:03:48.470
 maximum caution in our packet of 

00:03:46.280 --> 00:03:49.940
 gastronomic love let's put the 

00:03:48.470 --> 00:03:51.500
 onion over and you close everything to 

00:03:49.940 --> 00:03:53.750
 put it in the oven but before we go to 

00:03:51.500 --> 00:03:55.820
 paint it with a mixture of yolk 

00:03:53.750 --> 00:03:58.220
 and water to give it a touch of lato and 

00:03:55.820 --> 00:04:00.410
 this is the result this friends this is not 

00:03:58.220 --> 00:04:02.000
