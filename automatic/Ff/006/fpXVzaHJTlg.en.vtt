00:00:34.100 --> 00:00:34.110 
to get used a lot so it's actually bring

00:00:34.110 --> 00:00:35.510 
to get used a lot so it's actually bring
for<00:00:34.260> them<00:00:34.350> because<00:00:34.469> this<00:00:34.739> stage<00:00:34.950> is<00:00:35.250> point

00:00:35.510 --> 00:00:35.520 
for them because this stage is point

for them because this stage is point
analyzed<00:00:35.910> the<00:00:36.570> main<00:00:36.780> thing<00:00:37.050> is<00:00:37.170> socialization

analyzed the main thing is socialization

00:00:38.040 --> 00:00:39.770 
analyzed the main thing is socialization
and<00:00:38.219> environmental<00:00:39.120> trends<00:00:39.329> so<00:00:39.629> that's

00:00:39.770 --> 00:00:39.780 
and environmental trends so that's

00:00:39.780 --> 00:00:41.540 
and environmental trends so that's
meeting<00:00:40.050> different<00:00:40.500> people<00:00:40.680> different

00:00:41.540 --> 00:00:41.550 
meeting different people different

00:00:41.550 --> 00:00:46.910 
meeting different people different
smells<00:00:41.850> and<00:00:43.160> lots<00:00:44.160> of<00:00:44.280> flashing<00:00:44.760> lights<00:00:45.920> types

00:00:46.910 --> 00:00:46.920

00:00:52.819 --> 00:00:52.829 
them good background for when lesser

00:00:52.829 --> 00:00:54.470 
them good background for when lesser
life<00:00:53.190> when<00:00:53.430> the<00:00:53.520> concert<00:00:53.969> meet<00:00:54.300> different

00:00:54.470 --> 00:00:54.480 
life when the concert meet different

people in different environments the use
of<00:00:56.550> them<00:00:56.699> so<00:00:56.910> anything<00:00:57.629> like<00:00:57.719> this<00:00:57.930> is<00:00:58.050> always

00:00:58.279 --> 00:00:58.289 
of them so anything like this is always

00:00:58.289 --> 00:01:00.049 
of them so anything like this is always
a<00:00:58.320> good<00:00:58.500> thing<00:00:58.530> that<00:00:58.680> stays<00:00:58.980> with<00:00:59.219> them<00:00:59.340> well

00:01:01.689 --> 00:01:01.699 
say we do this is the socialization

00:01:01.699 --> 00:01:04.549 
say we do this is the socialization
environmental<00:01:02.699> training<00:01:03.090> but<00:01:03.390> also<00:01:03.570> for<00:01:04.199> next

00:01:04.549 --> 00:01:04.559 
environmental training but also for next

spinal<00:01:08.430> screwdrivers<00:01:09.180> don't<00:01:09.689> learn<00:01:09.810> to<00:01:09.960> play

00:01:10.130 --> 00:01:10.140 
spinal screwdrivers don't learn to play

00:01:10.140 --> 00:01:12.109 
spinal screwdrivers don't learn to play
with<00:01:10.320> them<00:01:10.500> very<00:01:10.680> happy<00:01:10.890> comfortable<00:01:11.670> playing

00:01:12.109 --> 00:01:12.119 
with them very happy comfortable playing

00:01:12.119 --> 00:01:14.570 
with them very happy comfortable playing
with<00:01:12.299> them<00:01:12.510> and<00:01:12.960> eventually<00:01:13.170> look<00:01:13.650> those<00:01:14.280> kind

00:01:15.859 --> 00:01:15.869 
of items and be hidden so they have to

00:01:15.869 --> 00:01:17.840 
of items and be hidden so they have to
find<00:01:16.140> those<00:01:16.380> items<00:01:16.590> and<00:01:16.920> associate<00:01:17.490> human

and<00:01:21.720> bitter<00:01:22.110> tracking<00:01:22.500> with<00:01:22.619> them<00:01:22.830> so<00:01:23.130> that

00:01:23.300 --> 00:01:23.310 
and bitter tracking with them so that

00:01:23.310 --> 00:01:25.760

hopefully<00:01:23.700> by<00:01:24.060> 12<00:01:24.750> months<00:01:24.930> I'm<00:01:25.170> on<00:01:25.320> the<00:01:25.380> JUCO

00:01:25.760 --> 00:01:25.770 
hopefully by 12 months I'm on the JUCO

00:01:25.770 --> 00:01:27.560 
hopefully by 12 months I'm on the JUCO
initial<00:01:26.159> course<00:01:26.400> will<00:01:27.210> have<00:01:27.270> all<00:01:27.450> the

00:01:27.560 --> 00:01:27.570 
initial course will have all the

00:01:27.570 --> 00:01:29.660 
initial course will have all the
background<00:01:27.720> work<00:01:28.020> done<00:01:28.439> and<00:01:28.650> that<00:01:29.340> the<00:01:29.430> course

00:01:29.660 --> 00:01:29.670 
background work done and that the course

00:01:29.670 --> 00:01:30.859 
background work done and that the course
will<00:01:29.880> only<00:01:29.939> last<00:01:30.150> six<00:01:30.390> to<00:01:30.420> eight<00:01:30.600> weeks

00:01:30.859 --> 00:01:30.869 
will only last six to eight weeks

00:01:30.869 --> 00:01:33.980 
will only last six to eight weeks
whereas<00:01:31.380> normally<00:01:32.070> for<00:01:32.430> a<00:01:32.460> brand<00:01:33.270> new<00:01:33.360> dog<00:01:33.750> and

00:01:33.980 --> 00:01:33.990 
whereas normally for a brand new dog and

00:01:33.990 --> 00:01:36.429 
whereas normally for a brand new dog and
you<00:01:34.920> would<00:01:35.070> probably<00:01:35.430> take<00:01:35.520> about<00:01:35.610> 15<00:01:36.090> months

00:01:36.429 --> 00:01:36.439 
you would probably take about 15 months

00:01:36.439 --> 00:01:39.080 
you would probably take about 15 months
after<00:01:37.439> all<00:01:37.680> six<00:01:38.009> months<00:01:38.400> we'll<00:01:38.670> bring<00:01:38.820> them<00:01:38.939> in

00:01:39.080 --> 00:01:39.090 
after all six months we'll bring them in

00:01:39.090 --> 00:01:40.730 
after all six months we'll bring them in
back<00:01:39.450> into<00:01:39.630> the<00:01:39.750> chair<00:01:39.960> environment<00:01:40.500> for<00:01:40.650> the

00:01:40.730 --> 00:01:40.740 
back into the chair environment for the

00:01:40.740 --> 00:01:43.100 
back into the chair environment for the
color<00:01:40.920> popping<00:01:41.189> colors<00:01:41.369> and<00:01:41.939> like<00:01:42.060> the<00:01:42.390> train

00:01:43.100 --> 00:01:43.110 
color popping colors and like the train

00:01:43.110 --> 00:01:45.200 
color popping colors and like the train
is<00:01:43.229> an<00:01:43.530> idea<00:01:44.040> of<00:01:44.189> whereabouts<00:01:44.700> they<00:01:44.939> are<00:01:45.060> in

00:01:45.200 --> 00:01:45.210 
is an idea of whereabouts they are in

00:01:45.210 --> 00:01:47.060 
is an idea of whereabouts they are in
the<00:01:45.270> development<00:01:45.630> and<00:01:45.899> hopefully<00:01:46.649> by<00:01:46.829> then

00:01:47.060 --> 00:01:47.070 
the development and hopefully by then

00:01:47.070 --> 00:01:48.889 
the development and hopefully by then
they'll<00:01:47.729> be<00:01:47.820> happy<00:01:47.850> to<00:01:48.210> play<00:01:48.390> with<00:01:48.420> different

00:01:48.889 --> 00:01:48.899 
they'll be happy to play with different

00:01:48.899 --> 00:01:50.520 
they'll be happy to play with different
types<00:01:49.140> of<00:01:49.350> change<00:01:49.890> through

00:01:50.520 --> 00:01:50.530 
types of change through

00:01:50.530 --> 00:01:52.170 
types of change through
having<00:01:51.070> and<00:01:51.250> hopefully<00:01:51.790> by<00:01:51.910> then<00:01:52.060> as

00:01:52.170 --> 00:01:52.180 
having and hopefully by then as

00:01:52.180 --> 00:01:54.570 
having and hopefully by then as
rollability<00:01:52.540> fighting<00:01:53.530> them<00:01:53.680> and<00:01:53.800> by<00:01:54.400> that

00:01:54.570 --> 00:01:54.580 
rollability fighting them and by that

00:01:54.580 --> 00:01:56.700 
rollability fighting them and by that
