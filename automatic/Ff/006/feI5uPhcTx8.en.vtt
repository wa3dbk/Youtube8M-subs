00:00:40.280 --> 00:00:40.290 
front there I think this stuff in the

00:00:40.290 --> 00:00:43.580 
front there I think this stuff in the
corner<00:00:40.649> is<00:00:40.860> an<00:00:41.280> african<00:00:41.790> green<00:00:42.000> hi<00:00:42.270> grow<00:00:42.590> these

00:00:43.580 --> 00:00:43.590 
corner is an african green hi grow these

00:00:43.590 --> 00:00:46.400 
corner is an african green hi grow these
angelfish<00:00:44.219> or<00:00:44.579> definitely<00:00:45.480> growing<00:00:46.079> pretty

00:00:46.400 --> 00:00:46.410 
angelfish or definitely growing pretty

00:00:46.410 --> 00:00:50.709 
angelfish or definitely growing pretty
well<00:00:46.590> for<00:00:46.800> me<00:00:47.010> now<00:00:48.649> I've<00:00:49.649> had<00:00:49.829> to<00:00:49.980> change<00:00:50.250> some

00:00:50.709 --> 00:00:50.719 
well for me now I've had to change some

00:00:50.719 --> 00:00:53.420 
well for me now I've had to change some
stock<00:00:51.719> in<00:00:51.750> here<00:00:52.289> but<00:00:52.559> I'm<00:00:52.710> really<00:00:52.860> liking<00:00:53.190> it

00:00:53.420 --> 00:00:53.430

stock in here but I'm really liking it
I've<00:00:54.329> got<00:00:54.480> some<00:00:54.660> survey<00:00:54.989> tetras<00:00:55.469> that<00:00:55.710> are<00:00:55.800> fun

00:00:56.029 --> 00:00:56.039 
I've got some survey tetras that are fun

00:00:56.039 --> 00:00:57.709 
I've got some survey tetras that are fun
but<00:00:56.250> I<00:00:56.309> think<00:00:56.520> they're<00:00:56.640> Nippon<00:00:57.030> angelfish<00:00:57.600> a

00:00:57.709 --> 00:00:57.719 
but I think they're Nippon angelfish a

00:00:57.719 --> 00:00:59.689 
but I think they're Nippon angelfish a
little<00:00:57.960> bit<00:00:58.140> there<00:00:58.350> things<00:00:59.190> just<00:00:59.399> aren't<00:00:59.579> what

00:00:59.689 --> 00:00:59.699 
little bit there things just aren't what

00:00:59.699 --> 00:01:01.069 
little bit there things just aren't what
they<00:00:59.850> could<00:01:00.090> be

00:01:01.069 --> 00:01:01.079 
they could be

00:01:01.079 --> 00:01:03.410 
they could be
a<00:01:01.109> couple<00:01:01.770> different<00:01:02.010> times<00:01:02.160> up<00:01:03.030> here<00:01:03.239> in<00:01:03.329> the

00:01:03.410 --> 00:01:03.420 
a couple different times up here in the

00:01:03.420 --> 00:01:05.000 
a couple different times up here in the
front

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:05.010 
front

00:01:05.010 --> 00:01:09.140 
front
I<00:01:05.100> think<00:01:05.790> it's<00:01:05.939> one<00:01:06.119> dedi<00:01:06.390> and<00:01:07.520> this<00:01:08.520> copperish

00:01:09.140 --> 00:01:09.150 
I think it's one dedi and this copperish

00:01:09.150 --> 00:01:11.929 
I think it's one dedi and this copperish
one<00:01:09.510> that's<00:01:09.840> kind<00:01:10.080> of<00:01:10.170> getting<00:01:11.159> going<00:01:11.189> finally

00:01:11.929 --> 00:01:11.939 
one that's kind of getting going finally

00:01:29.960 --> 00:01:29.970 
getting some size on them hoping maybe a

00:01:29.970 --> 00:01:32.450 
getting some size on them hoping maybe a

pair will take off and breed for me but

00:01:32.460 --> 00:01:35.210 
pair will take off and breed for me but
in<00:01:32.939> the<00:01:33.509> meantime<00:01:33.689> that's<00:01:34.259> it<00:01:34.560> I'm<00:01:35.040> liking

00:01:35.210 --> 00:01:35.220 
in the meantime that's it I'm liking

00:01:35.220 --> 00:01:37.850 
in the meantime that's it I'm liking
where<00:01:35.460> this<00:01:35.490> is<00:01:35.610> going<00:01:36.180> definitely<00:01:36.810> 11<00:01:37.170> the

00:01:37.850 --> 00:01:37.860 
where this is going definitely 11 the

00:01:37.860 --> 00:01:42.830 
where this is going definitely 11 the
the<00:01:38.369> planted<00:01:38.790> tank<00:01:39.680> set<00:01:40.680> up<00:01:40.829> now<00:01:41.630> just<00:01:42.630> keep

00:01:42.830 --> 00:01:42.840 
the planted tank set up now just keep

00:01:42.840 --> 00:01:45.770 
the planted tank set up now just keep
letting<00:01:43.049> stuff<00:01:43.409> fill<00:01:43.649> in<00:01:44.299> might<00:01:45.299> take<00:01:45.570> out

00:01:45.770 --> 00:01:45.780 
letting stuff fill in might take out

00:01:45.780 --> 00:01:47.749 
letting stuff fill in might take out
that<00:01:46.079> African<00:01:46.829> high<00:01:47.159> grow<00:01:47.369> there<00:01:47.549> in<00:01:47.670> the

00:01:47.749 --> 00:01:47.759 
that African high grow there in the

00:01:47.759 --> 00:01:50.450 
that African high grow there in the
corner<00:01:48.119> and<00:01:48.509> just<00:01:48.570> let<00:01:49.439> that<00:01:49.560> door<00:01:49.799> sad<00:01:50.100> fill

00:01:50.450 --> 00:01:50.460 
corner and just let that door sad fill

00:01:50.460 --> 00:01:51.980 
corner and just let that door sad fill
in<00:01:50.610> that<00:01:50.759> area<00:01:51.060> we'll<00:01:51.270> see<00:01:51.479> here<00:01:51.750> but

00:01:51.980 --> 00:01:51.990 
in that area we'll see here but

00:01:51.990 --> 00:01:54.260 
in that area we'll see here but
otherwise<00:01:52.890> this<00:01:53.310> is<00:01:53.369> how<00:01:53.670> it's<00:01:53.850> set<00:01:54.060> up

00:01:54.260 --> 00:01:54.270 
otherwise this is how it's set up

00:01:54.270 --> 00:01:57.679 
otherwise this is how it's set up
and<00:01:55.130> maybe<00:01:56.130> the<00:01:56.340> anubius<00:01:56.850> will<00:01:57.060> keep<00:01:57.180> going<00:01:57.390> on

00:01:57.679 --> 00:01:57.689 
and maybe the anubius will keep going on

00:01:57.689 --> 00:02:00.230 
and maybe the anubius will keep going on
the<00:01:57.869> drift<00:01:58.350> would<00:01:58.560> like<00:01:59.430> to<00:01:59.549> see<00:01:59.759> that<00:01:59.939> grow<00:02:00.210> a

00:02:00.230 --> 00:02:00.240 
the drift would like to see that grow a

00:02:00.240 --> 00:02:02.719 
the drift would like to see that grow a
little<00:02:00.420> more<00:02:00.829> but<00:02:01.829> otherwise<00:02:02.009> I'm<00:02:02.340> happy<00:02:02.610> with

00:02:02.719 --> 00:02:02.729 
little more but otherwise I'm happy with
