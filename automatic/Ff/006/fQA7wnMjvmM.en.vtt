strength<00:02:29.960> stuff<00:02:30.260> I<00:02:30.470> didn't<00:02:30.740> mean<00:02:30.830> to<00:02:30.860> do<00:02:31.130> it

00:02:31.150 --> 00:02:31.160 
strength stuff I didn't mean to do it

00:02:31.160 --> 00:02:33.130 
strength stuff I didn't mean to do it
this<00:02:31.370> way<00:02:31.610> but<00:02:31.670> it's<00:02:32.420> the<00:02:32.510> way<00:02:32.630> it<00:02:32.750> ended<00:02:32.900> up

00:02:33.130 --> 00:02:33.140 
this way but it's the way it ended up

this way but it's the way it ended up
I'm<00:02:33.950> i<00:02:34.070> have<00:02:34.220> this<00:02:34.340> speed<00:02:34.610> and<00:02:34.760> strength<00:02:34.940> lock

and load of the 1700 helmet it's a

00:02:38.540 --> 00:02:41.700 
and load of the 1700 helmet it's a
modular<00:02:38.930> helmet<00:02:39.370> if<00:02:40.370> I<00:02:40.460> had<00:02:40.580> to<00:02:40.670> do<00:02:40.760> it<00:02:40.790> again<00:02:41.060> I

00:02:41.700 --> 00:02:41.710 
modular helmet if I had to do it again I

00:02:41.710 --> 00:02:44.010 
modular helmet if I had to do it again I
probably<00:02:42.710> wouldn't<00:02:43.070> get<00:02:43.160> a<00:02:43.220> modular<00:02:43.640> helmet

00:02:44.010 --> 00:02:44.020 
probably wouldn't get a modular helmet

probably wouldn't get a modular helmet
it's<00:02:45.020> kind<00:02:45.170> of<00:02:45.290> noisy<00:02:45.440> when<00:02:45.950> you're<00:02:46.100> on<00:02:46.220> the
