the seating system to store memory into
the<00:00:18.869> wheelchair<00:00:19.050> there's<00:00:19.710> a<00:00:19.800> few<00:00:20.010> steps<00:00:20.250> that

00:00:20.359 --> 00:00:20.369 
the wheelchair there's a few steps that

00:00:20.369 --> 00:00:21.800 
the wheelchair there's a few steps that
we're<00:00:20.550> gonna<00:00:20.640> follow<00:00:20.880> throughout<00:00:21.270> this<00:00:21.480> video

00:00:21.800 --> 00:00:21.810 
we're gonna follow throughout this video

00:00:21.810 --> 00:00:24.290 
we're gonna follow throughout this video
the<00:00:22.500> first<00:00:22.680> step<00:00:23.039> is<00:00:23.279> to<00:00:23.430> position<00:00:23.760> the<00:00:23.939> chair

00:00:24.290 --> 00:00:24.300 
the first step is to position the chair

00:00:24.300 --> 00:00:26.269 
the first step is to position the chair
in<00:00:24.539> which<00:00:24.930> it<00:00:25.170> is<00:00:25.199> that<00:00:25.619> you<00:00:25.740> want<00:00:25.980> it<00:00:26.039> to<00:00:26.160> be

00:00:26.269 --> 00:00:26.279 
in which it is that you want it to be

00:00:26.279 --> 00:00:29.089 
in which it is that you want it to be
saved<00:00:26.699> into<00:00:27.090> that<00:00:27.359> memory<00:00:27.570> position<00:00:27.930> use<00:00:28.920> your

00:00:29.089 --> 00:00:29.099 
saved into that memory position use your

00:00:29.099 --> 00:00:31.099 
saved into that memory position use your
ICS<00:00:29.519> switch<00:00:29.789> box<00:00:30.090> to<00:00:30.330> position<00:00:30.779> the<00:00:30.900> chair

into<00:00:31.410> that<00:00:31.859> spot<00:00:32.250> at<00:00:32.550> this<00:00:33.000> point<00:00:33.300> we<00:00:33.420> haven't

00:00:33.620 --> 00:00:33.630 
into that spot at this point we haven't

00:00:33.630 --> 00:00:35.389 
into that spot at this point we haven't
entered<00:00:34.050> any<00:00:34.170> type<00:00:34.469> of<00:00:34.500> memory<00:00:34.980> mode<00:00:35.190> in<00:00:35.370> that

entered any type of memory mode in that
switch<00:00:35.760> box<00:00:36.030> we're<00:00:36.360> only<00:00:36.540> using<00:00:36.840> the<00:00:37.110> switch

00:00:37.310 --> 00:00:37.320 
switch box we're only using the switch

00:00:37.320 --> 00:00:40.040 
switch box we're only using the switch
box<00:00:37.530> to<00:00:37.860> position<00:00:38.399> the<00:00:38.520> chair<00:00:38.790> once<00:00:39.750> you<00:00:39.899> get

00:00:40.040 --> 00:00:40.050 
box to position the chair once you get

00:00:40.050 --> 00:00:42.080 
box to position the chair once you get
the<00:00:40.170> chair<00:00:40.379> into<00:00:40.530> that<00:00:40.739> desired<00:00:41.129> position<00:00:41.760> you

00:00:42.080 --> 00:00:42.090 
the chair into that desired position you

00:00:42.090 --> 00:00:44.360 
the chair into that desired position you
then<00:00:42.329> go<00:00:42.930> through<00:00:43.170> the<00:00:43.290> steps<00:00:43.559> of<00:00:43.770> programming

00:00:44.360 --> 00:00:44.370 
then go through the steps of programming

00:00:44.370 --> 00:00:48.590 
then go through the steps of programming
and<00:00:44.520> saving<00:00:44.940> that<00:00:44.969> memory<00:00:47.090> when<00:00:48.090> programming

00:00:48.590 --> 00:00:48.600 
and saving that memory when programming

00:00:48.600 --> 00:00:51.080 
and saving that memory when programming
