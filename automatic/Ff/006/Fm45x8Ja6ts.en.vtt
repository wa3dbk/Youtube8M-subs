00:02:29.549 --> 00:02:31.039 
puzzle elements of the game what we've
done<00:02:29.730> though<00:02:29.970> is<00:02:30.090> we've<00:02:30.329> tried<00:02:30.540> to<00:02:30.660> make<00:02:30.810> them

00:02:31.039 --> 00:02:31.049 
done though is we've tried to make them

00:02:31.049 --> 00:02:33.110 
done though is we've tried to make them
a<00:02:31.140> little<00:02:31.200> bit<00:02:31.380> more<00:02:31.500> organic<00:02:32.310> in<00:02:32.610> terms<00:02:32.670> of

00:02:33.110 --> 00:02:33.120 
a little bit more organic in terms of

00:02:33.120 --> 00:02:34.819 
a little bit more organic in terms of
how<00:02:33.269> they're<00:02:33.420> integrated<00:02:33.870> into<00:02:34.019> the<00:02:34.110> world<00:02:34.290> we

how they're integrated into the world we

00:02:34.829 --> 00:02:36.380 
how they're integrated into the world we

00:02:36.380 --> 00:02:36.390 
call it smart resource of Lara so

00:02:36.390 --> 00:02:38.360 
call it smart resource of Lara so
essentially<00:02:36.810> Lara's<00:02:37.620> got<00:02:37.769> a<00:02:37.799> keen<00:02:38.160> awareness

essentially Lara's got a keen awareness
of<00:02:38.850> our<00:02:38.940> environment<00:02:39.180> and<00:02:39.510> she's<00:02:39.690> able<00:02:39.810> to
