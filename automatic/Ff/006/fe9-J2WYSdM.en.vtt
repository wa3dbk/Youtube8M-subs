there<00:00:14.460> you<00:00:14.580> go<00:00:14.700> and<00:00:15.540> move<00:00:15.780> it<00:00:15.900> back<00:00:15.929> this<00:00:16.230> in

00:00:16.400 --> 00:00:16.410 
there you go and move it back this in

00:00:16.410 --> 00:00:18.460 
there you go and move it back this in
the<00:00:16.500> world

00:00:18.460 --> 00:00:18.470 
the world

00:00:18.470 --> 00:00:22.340

no<00:00:19.609> yeah<00:00:20.609> he's<00:00:20.820> pretty<00:00:21.029> good<00:00:21.119> time<00:00:21.510> to<00:00:21.750> turn

00:00:22.340 --> 00:00:22.350 
no yeah he's pretty good time to turn

00:00:22.350 --> 00:00:25.880 
no yeah he's pretty good time to turn

00:00:42.139 --> 00:00:42.149 
gots machining and G to turn off the

00:00:42.149 --> 00:00:48.830 
gots machining and G to turn off the
grid<00:00:43.340> and<00:00:44.340> it's<00:00:44.640> get<00:00:44.820> really<00:00:45.120> segments<00:00:47.840> grab

00:00:48.830 --> 00:00:48.840

the<00:00:49.050> rotate<00:00:49.410> tool<00:00:49.910> angle<00:00:50.910> snap<00:00:51.000> and<00:00:52.430> hold<00:00:53.430> down

00:00:53.680 --> 00:00:53.690 
the rotate tool angle snap and hold down

00:00:53.690 --> 00:00:57.439 
the rotate tool angle snap and hold down
shift<00:00:54.690> and<00:00:54.809> just<00:00:55.350> rotate<00:00:55.770> them<00:00:55.949> well<00:00:56.940> clonic

00:00:57.439 --> 00:00:57.449 
shift and just rotate them well clonic

00:00:57.449 --> 00:00:59.840 
shift and just rotate them well clonic
so<00:00:58.320> we<00:00:58.410> won't<00:00:58.559> have<00:00:58.739> to<00:00:58.920> bother<00:00:59.430> create

00:00:59.840 --> 00:00:59.850 
so we won't have to bother create

00:00:59.850 --> 00:01:03.950 
so we won't have to bother create
another<00:01:00.030> one<00:01:00.260> manually<00:01:01.699> and<00:01:02.699> hold<00:01:03.539> down<00:01:03.600> shift

00:01:03.950 --> 00:01:03.960 
another one manually and hold down shift

00:01:03.960 --> 00:01:06.710 
another one manually and hold down shift
and<00:01:04.110> rotate<00:01:04.199> again<00:01:04.739> they'll<00:01:05.580> create<00:01:05.820> the<00:01:06.479> back

00:01:06.710 --> 00:01:06.720 
and rotate again they'll create the back

00:01:06.720 --> 00:01:11.179 
and rotate again they'll create the back
one<00:01:06.960> and<00:01:08.119> rotate<00:01:09.119> this<00:01:09.630> way<00:01:09.890> they'll<00:01:10.890> create<00:01:11.130> a

00:01:11.179 --> 00:01:11.189 
one and rotate this way they'll create a

00:01:11.189 --> 00:01:14.719 
one and rotate this way they'll create a
side<00:01:11.460> one<00:01:12.380> now<00:01:13.380> if<00:01:13.530> you<00:01:13.680> remember<00:01:13.890> photoshop

00:01:14.719 --> 00:01:14.729 
side one now if you remember photoshop

00:01:14.729 --> 00:01:19.010 
side one now if you remember photoshop
we<00:01:14.909> um<00:01:15.350> we<00:01:16.350> make<00:01:16.560> the<00:01:16.680> top<00:01:17.540> we<00:01:18.540> made<00:01:18.720> the<00:01:18.840> top

00:01:19.010 --> 00:01:19.020 
we um we make the top we made the top

00:01:19.020 --> 00:01:24.380 
we um we make the top we made the top
and<00:01:19.259> the<00:01:19.350> side<00:01:21.229> twice<00:01:22.229> as<00:01:22.409> big<00:01:22.619> as<00:01:22.770> the<00:01:23.390> front

00:01:24.380 --> 00:01:24.390 
and the side twice as big as the front

00:01:24.390 --> 00:01:28.039 
and the side twice as big as the front
and<00:01:24.600> back<00:01:24.840> images<00:01:25.729> so<00:01:26.729> let's<00:01:27.000> make<00:01:27.210> that<00:01:27.360> 400

00:01:28.039 --> 00:01:28.049 
and back images so let's make that 400

you can tell it's in by arm this line

00:04:16.980 --> 00:04:19.580 
you can tell it's in by arm this line
right<00:04:17.100> here<00:04:17.160> that's<00:04:17.549> that's<00:04:18.450> the<00:04:18.750> side<00:04:19.230> plane

00:04:19.580 --> 00:04:19.590 
right here that's that's the side plane

00:04:19.590 --> 00:04:23.810 
right here that's that's the side plane
actually<00:04:21.019> that<00:04:22.019> one<00:04:22.200> the<00:04:22.410> arm<00:04:22.620> well<00:04:23.280> that's<00:04:23.610> it

00:04:23.810 --> 00:04:23.820 
actually that one the arm well that's it

00:04:23.820 --> 00:04:26.480 
actually that one the arm well that's it
zero<00:04:24.210> zero<00:04:24.450> zero<00:04:24.480> so<00:04:25.080> can<00:04:25.740> be<00:04:25.860> preacher<00:04:26.190> that's

zero zero zero so can be preacher that's
in<00:04:26.730> the<00:04:26.820> world<00:04:28.070> move<00:04:29.070> it<00:04:29.250> up<00:04:31.370> so<00:04:32.370> the<00:04:32.460> wheels

00:04:32.660 --> 00:04:32.670 
in the world move it up so the wheels

00:04:32.670 --> 00:04:41.290 
in the world move it up so the wheels
just<00:04:33.120> touch<00:04:33.360> that<00:04:35.060> line<00:04:36.060> there

00:04:41.290 --> 00:04:41.300 

00:04:41.300 --> 00:04:45.440

yep that'll do now I've heard uh okay
the<00:04:45.630> back<00:04:45.960> might<00:04:46.590> want<00:04:46.740> to<00:04:46.770> do<00:04:46.860> that<00:04:47.040> as<00:04:47.100> well

00:04:47.420 --> 00:04:47.430 
the back might want to do that as well

00:04:47.430 --> 00:04:49.280 
the back might want to do that as well
since<00:04:48.000> you'll<00:04:48.150> be<00:04:48.180> changing<00:04:48.720> back<00:04:48.960> and<00:04:48.990> forth

00:04:49.280 --> 00:04:49.290 
since you'll be changing back and forth

00:04:49.290 --> 00:04:56.400 
since you'll be changing back and forth
a<00:04:49.410> lot<00:04:50.930> the<00:04:51.930> same<00:04:52.230> thing<00:04:52.410> here

00:04:56.400 --> 00:04:56.410 

00:04:56.410 --> 00:05:05.310 

and<00:04:56.980> move<00:04:57.280> it<00:04:57.400> up<00:05:00.000> go<00:05:01.770> and<00:05:02.770> grab<00:05:03.130> the<00:05:03.280> side<00:05:04.320> you

00:05:05.310 --> 00:05:05.320

and move it up go and grab the side you
might<00:05:05.500> want<00:05:05.650> to<00:05:05.970> change<00:05:06.970> it<00:05:07.120> to<00:05:07.270> the<00:05:07.360> right<00:05:07.570> one

00:05:09.230 --> 00:05:09.240 
might want to change it to the right one

00:05:09.240 --> 00:05:16.970 
might want to change it to the right one
what<00:05:10.240> you<00:05:10.330> want<00:05:10.480> see<00:05:10.690> anything<00:05:12.900> up

00:05:16.970 --> 00:05:16.980 

00:05:16.980 --> 00:05:20.350 

and<00:05:17.450> the<00:05:18.450> problem<00:05:18.900> is<00:05:19.200> I'm<00:05:19.560> not<00:05:19.680> sure<00:05:19.740> of<00:05:19.950> these

00:05:20.350 --> 00:05:20.360 
and the problem is I'm not sure of these

00:05:20.360 --> 00:05:23.330 
and the problem is I'm not sure of these
these<00:05:21.360> two<00:05:21.540> lined<00:05:21.840> up<00:05:21.990> the<00:05:22.380> top<00:05:22.620> in<00:05:22.800> the<00:05:22.980> site

00:05:23.330 --> 00:05:23.340 
these two lined up the top in the site

00:05:23.340 --> 00:05:28.780 
these two lined up the top in the site
so<00:05:24.260> let's<00:05:25.260> grab<00:05:25.530> that<00:05:25.820> front<00:05:26.820> one<00:05:27.030> and<00:05:27.410> move<00:05:28.410> it

00:05:28.780 --> 00:05:28.790 
so let's grab that front one and move it

00:05:28.790 --> 00:05:34.880 
so let's grab that front one and move it
right<00:05:29.790> back<00:05:30.030> just<00:05:30.770> touch<00:05:31.770> the<00:05:32.070> back<00:05:33.770> got<00:05:34.770> the

00:05:34.880 --> 00:05:34.890 
right back just touch the back got the

00:05:34.890 --> 00:05:40.430 
right back just touch the back got the
back<00:05:35.100> one<00:05:35.570> and<00:05:36.570> move<00:05:37.170> it<00:05:37.350> right<00:05:37.890> forward<00:05:39.440> so

00:05:40.430 --> 00:05:40.440 
back one and move it right forward so

00:05:40.440 --> 00:05:44.240 
back one and move it right forward so

00:05:44.240 --> 00:05:44.250 
just touch the front and grab that got

00:05:44.250 --> 00:05:48.770 
just touch the front and grab that got
to<00:05:44.340> talk<00:05:44.520> to<00:05:44.610> you<00:05:45.200> stop<00:05:46.200> playing<00:05:46.470> and<00:05:47.630> move<00:05:48.630> it

00:05:48.770 --> 00:05:48.780 
to talk to you stop playing and move it

right yeah it's close enough

00:05:54.770 --> 00:06:03.860 
right yeah it's close enough

00:06:03.860 --> 00:06:03.870 

00:06:03.870 --> 00:06:08.010 

and<00:06:04.870> here<00:06:05.680> we<00:06:05.770> go<00:06:06.420> now<00:06:07.420> you<00:06:07.450> might<00:06:07.690> want<00:06:07.960> to

and here we go now you might want to
also<00:06:08.440> freeze<00:06:09.070> this<00:06:09.340> so<00:06:09.820> you<00:06:09.880> don't

00:06:10.080 --> 00:06:10.090 
also freeze this so you don't

00:06:10.090 --> 00:06:13.650 
also freeze this so you don't
accidentally<00:06:10.690> go<00:06:11.110> around<00:06:11.350> move<00:06:11.800> this<00:06:12.660> and

00:06:13.650 --> 00:06:13.660 
accidentally go around move this and

00:06:13.660 --> 00:06:16.830 
accidentally go around move this and
just<00:06:14.050> select<00:06:14.620> all<00:06:14.710> of<00:06:14.830> them<00:06:15.300> but<00:06:16.300> in

00:06:16.830 --> 00:06:16.840 
just select all of them but in

00:06:16.840 --> 00:06:20.250 
just select all of them but in

right-click but if you just click you

00:06:20.260 --> 00:06:22.400 
right-click but if you just click you
just<00:06:20.530> notice<00:06:20.800> that<00:06:20.860> it'll<00:06:21.340> disappear

00:06:22.400 --> 00:06:22.410 
just notice that it'll disappear

00:06:22.410 --> 00:06:26.010 
just notice that it'll disappear
so<00:06:23.410> let's<00:06:23.800> undo<00:06:24.130> that<00:06:24.310> right<00:06:25.210> click<00:06:25.420> go<00:06:25.690> to

00:06:26.010 --> 00:06:26.020 
so let's undo that right click go to

00:06:26.020 --> 00:06:30.390 
so let's undo that right click go to
properties<00:06:26.140> and<00:06:27.180> uncheck<00:06:28.180> that<00:06:28.210> and<00:06:29.250> you<00:06:30.250> can
