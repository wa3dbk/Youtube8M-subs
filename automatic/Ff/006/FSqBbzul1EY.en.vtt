people there yeah so we've showed this

00:00:15.770 --> 00:00:19.340 
people there yeah so we've showed this
that<00:00:16.770> basically<00:00:17.670> the<00:00:17.880> Atlas<00:00:18.180> 10<00:00:18.420> is<00:00:18.630> going<00:00:19.230> to

00:00:19.340 --> 00:00:19.350 
that basically the Atlas 10 is going to

00:00:19.350 --> 00:00:22.490 
that basically the Atlas 10 is going to
be<00:00:19.500> our<00:00:19.830> intro<00:00:20.369> level<00:00:20.880> if<00:00:21.240> you<00:00:21.420> like<00:00:21.570> slider

00:00:22.490 --> 00:00:22.500 
be our intro level if you like slider

00:00:22.500 --> 00:00:24.470 
be our intro level if you like slider
LTS<00:00:23.130> we<00:00:23.310> call<00:00:23.430> them<00:00:23.519> linear<00:00:23.789> tracking<00:00:24.180> system

00:00:24.470 --> 00:00:24.480 
LTS we call them linear tracking system

00:00:24.480 --> 00:00:27.769 
LTS we call them linear tracking system
so<00:00:24.660> this<00:00:25.289> is<00:00:25.410> a<00:00:25.439> fully<00:00:25.740> bearing<00:00:26.779> breakable

00:00:27.769 --> 00:00:27.779 
so this is a fully bearing breakable

00:00:27.779 --> 00:00:30.740 
so this is a fully bearing breakable
lockable<00:00:28.289> slider<00:00:28.949> they<00:00:29.730> also<00:00:30.000> operates<00:00:30.539> in<00:00:30.689> a

00:00:30.740 --> 00:00:30.750 
lockable slider they also operates in a

00:00:30.750 --> 00:00:32.870 
lockable slider they also operates in a
vertical<00:00:30.900> mode<00:00:31.289> with<00:00:31.679> counterbalance<00:00:32.340> that's

00:00:32.870 --> 00:00:32.880 
vertical mode with counterbalance that's

00:00:32.880 --> 00:00:34.250 
vertical mode with counterbalance that's
going<00:00:33.030> to<00:00:33.090> start<00:00:33.360> at<00:00:33.719> about<00:00:33.840> five<00:00:34.110> hundred

00:00:34.250 --> 00:00:34.260 
going to start at about five hundred

00:00:34.260 --> 00:00:36.290 
going to start at about five hundred

00:00:36.290 --> 00:00:36.300 
fifty dollars for five hundred fifty

00:00:36.300 --> 00:00:37.880 
fifty dollars for five hundred fifty
dollars<00:00:36.570> you're<00:00:36.719> going<00:00:36.840> to<00:00:36.899> get<00:00:36.989> a<00:00:37.079> sled<00:00:37.440> and

00:00:37.880 --> 00:00:37.890 
dollars you're going to get a sled and

00:00:37.890 --> 00:00:39.020 
dollars you're going to get a sled and
I'm<00:00:38.010> going<00:00:38.129> to<00:00:38.190> get<00:00:38.280> this<00:00:38.399> nice<00:00:38.610> little<00:00:38.790> run

I'm going to get this nice little run

00:00:39.030 --> 00:00:41.840 
I'm going to get this nice little run

00:00:43.459 --> 00:00:43.469 
heavily engineered end plate that allows

00:00:43.469 --> 00:00:45.350 
heavily engineered end plate that allows
you<00:00:43.649> to<00:00:43.680> do<00:00:43.829> a<00:00:43.860> lot<00:00:44.100> of<00:00:44.129> stuff<00:00:44.520> one<00:00:45.120> of<00:00:45.210> them<00:00:45.329> is

00:00:45.350 --> 00:00:45.360 
you to do a lot of stuff one of them is

00:00:45.360 --> 00:00:47.360 
you to do a lot of stuff one of them is
to<00:00:45.539> put<00:00:45.750> on<00:00:45.899> the<00:00:46.079> legs<00:00:46.320> that<00:00:46.890> we<00:00:46.980> see<00:00:47.129> over<00:00:47.340> here

00:00:47.360 --> 00:00:47.370 
to put on the legs that we see over here

00:00:47.370 --> 00:00:48.410 
to put on the legs that we see over here
in<00:00:47.520> the<00:00:47.610> corner<00:00:47.640> we're<00:00:48.000> going<00:00:48.120> to<00:00:48.180> flip<00:00:48.390> this

00:00:48.410 --> 00:00:48.420 
in the corner we're going to flip this

00:00:48.420 --> 00:00:49.790 
in the corner we're going to flip this
up<00:00:48.690> into<00:00:48.840> the<00:00:48.930> vertical<00:00:49.289> motor<00:00:49.469> you<00:00:49.620> didn't

00:00:49.790 --> 00:00:49.800 
up into the vertical motor you didn't

00:00:49.800 --> 00:00:54.049 
up into the vertical motor you didn't
see<00:00:50.039> them<00:00:50.629> so<00:00:52.129> what<00:00:53.129> this<00:00:53.250> does<00:00:53.309> do<00:00:53.730> is<00:00:53.760> allow

00:00:54.049 --> 00:00:54.059 
see them so what this does do is allow

00:00:54.059 --> 00:00:56.240 
see them so what this does do is allow
you<00:00:54.120> to<00:00:54.270> mount<00:00:54.390> a<00:00:54.570> tripod<00:00:55.020> center<00:00:55.469> now<00:00:55.920> we<00:00:56.100> have

00:00:56.240 --> 00:00:56.250 
you to mount a tripod center now we have

00:00:56.250 --> 00:00:57.650 
you to mount a tripod center now we have
our<00:00:56.280> counterbalance<00:00:57.000> kid<00:00:57.180> with<00:00:57.329> Josiah

00:00:57.650 --> 00:00:57.660 
our counterbalance kid with Josiah

00:00:57.660 --> 00:01:01.880 
our counterbalance kid with Josiah
dienes<00:00:57.930> normally<00:00:58.680> you<00:00:59.250> would<00:00:59.449> run<00:01:00.559> in<00:01:01.559> a

00:01:01.880 --> 00:01:01.890 
dienes normally you would run in a

00:01:01.890 --> 00:01:03.470 
dienes normally you would run in a
center<00:01:02.489> mountain<00:01:02.850> road<00:01:03.000> without<00:01:03.180> the

00:01:03.470 --> 00:01:03.480 
center mountain road without the

00:01:03.480 --> 00:01:05.030 
center mountain road without the
counterbalance<00:01:03.989> but<00:01:04.170> so<00:01:04.710> everyone's

00:01:05.030 --> 00:01:05.040 
counterbalance but so everyone's

00:01:05.040 --> 00:01:06.200 
counterbalance but so everyone's
wondering<00:01:05.280> well<00:01:05.400> what's<00:01:05.610> the<00:01:05.700> counter<00:01:05.970> belts

00:01:06.200 --> 00:01:06.210 
wondering well what's the counter belts

00:01:06.210 --> 00:01:08.000 
wondering well what's the counter belts
will<00:01:06.360> it<00:01:06.450> show<00:01:06.600> so<00:01:06.930> we're<00:01:07.590> just<00:01:07.619> going<00:01:07.799> to<00:01:07.890> pull

we're going to have to probably be some
you<00:01:35.060> have<00:01:35.210> here<00:01:35.390> it's<00:01:35.540> not<00:01:35.600> okay<00:01:35.840> it's<00:01:36.380> quieter

00:01:36.700 --> 00:01:36.710 
you have here it's not okay it's quieter

00:01:36.710 --> 00:01:38.890 
you have here it's not okay it's quieter
now<00:01:36.860> seem<00:01:37.100> come<00:01:37.280> on<00:01:37.370> up<00:01:37.540> we'll<00:01:38.540> just<00:01:38.690> you<00:01:38.780> can

00:01:38.890 --> 00:01:38.900 
now seem come on up we'll just you can

00:01:38.900 --> 00:01:40.840 
now seem come on up we'll just you can
cut<00:01:39.080> there<00:01:39.320> and<00:01:39.500> just<00:01:39.590> cut<00:01:39.770> back<00:01:39.800> in<00:01:40.100> that<00:01:40.280> so

00:01:40.840 --> 00:01:40.850 
cut there and just cut back in that so

00:01:40.850 --> 00:01:42.130 
cut there and just cut back in that so
what<00:01:41.390> we've<00:01:41.540> done<00:01:41.570> it<00:01:41.780> now<00:01:41.900> that<00:01:42.020> you're

00:01:42.130 --> 00:01:42.140 
what we've done it now that you're

00:01:42.140 --> 00:01:46.090 
what we've done it now that you're
shooting<00:01:42.290> into<00:01:42.530> that<00:01:42.710> bright<00:01:42.920> light<00:01:44.980> you<00:01:45.980> can

00:01:46.090 --> 00:01:46.100 
shooting into that bright light you can

00:01:46.100 --> 00:01:47.560 
shooting into that bright light you can
see<00:01:46.160> the<00:01:46.370> lake<00:01:46.490> since<00:01:46.790> the<00:01:46.880> week<00:01:47.000> before<00:01:47.300> by

00:01:47.560 --> 00:01:47.570 
see the lake since the week before by

00:01:47.570 --> 00:01:49.750 
see the lake since the week before by
four<00:01:47.810> lakes<00:01:47.990> system<00:01:48.350> which<00:01:48.770> is<00:01:48.920> just<00:01:49.460> like<00:01:49.640> the

00:01:49.750 --> 00:01:49.760 
four lakes system which is just like the

00:01:49.760 --> 00:01:51.670 
four lakes system which is just like the
four-by-four<00:01:50.090> lake<00:01:50.540> system<00:01:50.870> behind<00:01:51.200> you<00:01:51.410> it

00:01:51.670 --> 00:01:51.680 
four-by-four lake system behind you it

00:01:51.680 --> 00:01:53.230 
four-by-four lake system behind you it
allows<00:01:51.980> you<00:01:52.160> to<00:01:52.280> individually<00:01:52.850> adjust<00:01:53.120> the

00:01:53.230 --> 00:01:53.240 
allows you to individually adjust the

00:01:53.240 --> 00:01:54.490 
allows you to individually adjust the
feet<00:01:53.420> so<00:01:53.600> if<00:01:53.690> you're<00:01:53.780> on<00:01:53.870> really<00:01:54.140> nasty

00:01:54.490 --> 00:01:54.500 
feet so if you're on really nasty

00:01:54.500 --> 00:01:56.470 
feet so if you're on really nasty
terrain<00:01:54.680> you'll<00:01:55.340> be<00:01:55.460> able<00:01:55.520> to<00:01:55.670> just<00:01:55.850> mount<00:01:56.330> it

00:01:56.470 --> 00:01:56.480 
terrain you'll be able to just mount it

00:01:56.480 --> 00:02:00.100 
terrain you'll be able to just mount it
on<00:01:56.630> two<00:01:57.200> rocks<00:01:57.410> for<00:01:57.740> example<00:01:58.070> this<00:01:58.940> setup<00:01:59.240> what

00:02:00.100 --> 00:02:00.110 
on two rocks for example this setup what

00:02:00.110 --> 00:02:01.450 
on two rocks for example this setup what
we'll<00:02:00.260> do<00:02:00.440> what<00:02:00.530> we<00:02:00.560> do<00:02:00.800> here<00:02:01.010> is<00:02:01.070> just<00:02:01.100> a<00:02:01.280> ball

00:02:01.450 --> 00:02:01.460 
we'll do what we do here is just a ball

00:02:01.460 --> 00:02:02.950 
we'll do what we do here is just a ball
head<00:02:01.670> like<00:02:01.820> this<00:02:02.000> I'm<00:02:02.480> just<00:02:02.660> going<00:02:02.780> to<00:02:02.810> loosen

00:02:02.950 --> 00:02:02.960 
head like this I'm just going to loosen

00:02:02.960 --> 00:02:09.430 
head like this I'm just going to loosen
this<00:02:06.040> already<00:02:07.040> loose<00:02:08.140> and<00:02:09.140> we're<00:02:09.260> going<00:02:09.380> to

00:02:09.430 --> 00:02:09.440 
this already loose and we're going to

00:02:09.440 --> 00:02:14.990 
this already loose and we're going to
flip<00:02:09.590> this<00:02:09.649> around<00:02:09.770> like<00:02:10.220> so<00:02:10.750> music

00:02:14.990 --> 00:02:15.000 

00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:19.050 

so<00:02:16.000> that<00:02:16.180> gives<00:02:16.330> us<00:02:16.480> our<00:02:17.820> camera<00:02:18.820> in<00:02:18.970> a

00:02:19.050 --> 00:02:19.060 
so that gives us our camera in a

00:02:19.060 --> 00:02:21.210 
so that gives us our camera in a
friendly<00:02:19.600> and<00:02:20.020> I<00:02:20.290> don't<00:02:20.470> have<00:02:20.590> any<00:02:20.770> weights<00:02:20.950> on

00:02:21.210 --> 00:02:21.220 
friendly and I don't have any weights on

00:02:21.220 --> 00:02:23.340 
friendly and I don't have any weights on
here<00:02:21.250> right<00:02:21.580> now<00:02:21.730> but<00:02:22.390> I<00:02:22.420> could<00:02:22.690> wait<00:02:22.840> this<00:02:23.080> so

00:02:23.340 --> 00:02:23.350 
here right now but I could wait this so

00:02:23.350 --> 00:02:25.290 
here right now but I could wait this so
that<00:02:23.500> I'm<00:02:23.740> not<00:02:23.770> doing<00:02:24.130> any<00:02:24.250> of<00:02:24.340> the<00:02:24.430> words<00:02:24.580> and

00:02:25.290 --> 00:02:25.300 
that I'm not doing any of the words and

00:02:25.300 --> 00:02:27.060 
that I'm not doing any of the words and
the<00:02:25.360> idea<00:02:25.750> behind<00:02:25.900> waiting<00:02:26.410> the<00:02:26.500> system<00:02:26.920> is

00:02:27.060 --> 00:02:27.070 
the idea behind waiting the system is

00:02:27.070 --> 00:02:29.310 
the idea behind waiting the system is
that<00:02:27.550> you<00:02:28.360> don't<00:02:28.570> have<00:02:28.630> a<00:02:28.720> lot<00:02:28.750> of<00:02:28.870> support

00:02:29.310 --> 00:02:29.320 
that you don't have a lot of support

00:02:29.320 --> 00:02:30.600 
that you don't have a lot of support
here<00:02:29.380> an<00:02:29.590> ideal<00:02:29.920> you<00:02:30.070> might<00:02:30.220> want<00:02:30.400> to<00:02:30.460> run<00:02:30.550> a

00:02:30.600 --> 00:02:30.610 
here an ideal you might want to run a

00:02:30.610 --> 00:02:32.880 
here an ideal you might want to run a
light<00:02:30.850> stand<00:02:31.060> if<00:02:31.750> you<00:02:31.960> balance<00:02:32.350> it<00:02:32.470> perfectly

00:02:32.880 --> 00:02:32.890 
light stand if you balance it perfectly

00:02:32.890 --> 00:02:34.050 
light stand if you balance it perfectly
and<00:02:32.980> you're<00:02:33.190> hardly<00:02:33.400> touching<00:02:33.700> it<00:02:33.910> though

00:02:34.050 --> 00:02:34.060 
and you're hardly touching it though

00:02:34.060 --> 00:02:35.640 
and you're hardly touching it though
you're<00:02:34.600> going<00:02:34.720> to<00:02:34.780> get<00:02:34.840> a<00:02:34.900> nice<00:02:35.050> smooth<00:02:35.350> shot

00:02:35.640 --> 00:02:35.650 
you're going to get a nice smooth shot

00:02:35.650 --> 00:02:38.820 
you're going to get a nice smooth shot
so<00:02:36.510> if<00:02:37.510> you<00:02:37.660> don't<00:02:37.810> want<00:02:37.930> to<00:02:37.990> use<00:02:38.080> wait<00:02:38.290> it's

00:02:38.820 --> 00:02:38.830 
so if you don't want to use wait it's

00:02:38.830 --> 00:02:41.670 
so if you don't want to use wait it's
much<00:02:39.040> easier<00:02:39.070> to<00:02:39.430> print<00:02:39.670> out<00:02:39.940> like<00:02:40.150> this<00:02:40.680> than

00:02:41.670 --> 00:02:41.680 
much easier to print out like this than

00:02:41.680 --> 00:02:45.570 
much easier to print out like this than
it<00:02:41.830> is<00:02:41.980> to<00:02:42.490> lift<00:02:42.640> the<00:02:42.760> camera<00:02:43.090> so<00:02:44.460> this<00:02:45.460> is

00:02:45.570 --> 00:02:45.580 
it is to lift the camera so this is

00:02:45.580 --> 00:02:47.700 
it is to lift the camera so this is
going<00:02:45.700> to<00:02:45.790> be<00:02:45.880> an<00:02:45.970> optional<00:02:46.360> kept<00:02:46.710> system

00:02:47.700 --> 00:02:47.710 
going to be an optional kept system

00:02:47.710 --> 00:02:49.920 
going to be an optional kept system
starts<00:02:47.980> at<00:02:48.070> 550<00:02:48.700> and<00:02:48.790> I<00:02:48.820> think<00:02:49.000> a<00:02:49.060> top<00:02:49.270> so<00:02:49.540> at

00:02:49.920 --> 00:02:49.930 
starts at 550 and I think a top so at

00:02:49.930 --> 00:02:52.950 
starts at 550 and I think a top so at
about<00:02:49.990> 50<00:02:50.760> for<00:02:51.760> time<00:02:51.940> lapse<00:02:52.180> because<00:02:52.870> we

00:02:52.950 --> 00:02:52.960 
about 50 for time lapse because we

00:02:52.960 --> 00:02:54.750 
about 50 for time lapse because we
wanted<00:02:53.140> to<00:02:53.230> know<00:02:53.320> bowl<00:02:53.470> time<00:02:53.650> lapse<00:02:53.760> in

00:02:54.750 --> 00:02:54.760 
wanted to know bowl time lapse in

00:02:54.760 --> 00:02:56.400 
wanted to know bowl time lapse in
vertical<00:02:55.420> mode<00:02:55.450> we're<00:02:55.720> working<00:02:55.990> on<00:02:56.080> a<00:02:56.110> drive

00:02:56.400 --> 00:02:56.410 
vertical mode we're working on a drive

00:02:56.410 --> 00:02:58.470 
vertical mode we're working on a drive
system<00:02:56.650> it's<00:02:57.250> modular<00:02:57.520> it'll<00:02:58.060> work<00:02:58.210> with<00:02:58.390> the

00:02:58.470 --> 00:02:58.480 
system it's modular it'll work with the

00:02:58.480 --> 00:03:01.050 
system it's modular it'll work with the
owl<00:02:58.570> sturdy<00:02:58.990> or<00:02:59.230> any<00:02:59.410> of<00:02:59.560> our<00:02:59.650> systems<00:03:00.070> and<00:03:00.370> a

00:03:01.050 --> 00:03:01.060 
owl sturdy or any of our systems and a

00:03:01.060 --> 00:03:03.660 
owl sturdy or any of our systems and a
two<00:03:01.720> transmission<00:03:02.260> options<00:03:02.590> so<00:03:02.920> we<00:03:03.430> can<00:03:03.550> make

00:03:03.660 --> 00:03:03.670 
two transmission options so we can make

00:03:03.670 --> 00:03:06.990 
two transmission options so we can make
this<00:03:03.820> go<00:03:03.880> up<00:03:04.210> right<00:03:04.390> over<00:03:04.740> a<00:03:05.740> date<00:03:06.000> basically

00:03:06.990 --> 00:03:07.000 
this go up right over a date basically

00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:08.850 
this go up right over a date basically
the<00:03:07.120> transmission<00:03:07.690> options<00:03:08.050> with<00:03:08.770> an

00:03:08.850 --> 00:03:08.860 
the transmission options with an

00:03:08.860 --> 00:03:10.380 
the transmission options with an
aircraft<00:03:09.250> cable<00:03:09.460> drive<00:03:09.790> systems<00:03:10.210> capable

00:03:10.380 --> 00:03:10.390 
aircraft cable drive systems capable

00:03:10.390 --> 00:03:11.560 
aircraft cable drive systems capable
teachers<00:03:10.900> off

00:03:11.560 --> 00:03:11.570 
teachers off

00:03:11.570 --> 00:03:14.360 
teachers off
hundreds<00:03:12.570> of<00:03:12.660> pounds<00:03:12.810> of<00:03:12.990> lead<00:03:13.170> but<00:03:13.770> with<00:03:14.280> the

00:03:14.360 --> 00:03:14.370 
hundreds of pounds of lead but with the

00:03:14.370 --> 00:03:16.580 
hundreds of pounds of lead but with the
balance<00:03:14.700> break<00:03:14.940> it's<00:03:15.900> not<00:03:16.020> going<00:03:16.110> to<00:03:16.230> do<00:03:16.470> much

00:03:16.580 --> 00:03:16.590 
balance break it's not going to do much

00:03:16.590 --> 00:03:21.680 
balance break it's not going to do much
so<00:03:17.510> so<00:03:18.510> that's<00:03:18.750> our<00:03:18.960> sort<00:03:19.230> of<00:03:19.970> LTS<00:03:20.970> that<00:03:21.300> was<00:03:21.420> 10

00:03:21.680 --> 00:03:21.690 
so so that's our sort of LTS that was 10

00:03:21.690 --> 00:03:23.540 
so so that's our sort of LTS that was 10
and<00:03:21.990> the<00:03:22.320> reason<00:03:22.560> we<00:03:22.680> call<00:03:22.860> it<00:03:22.950> a<00:03:23.040> twist<00:03:23.190> in<00:03:23.430> as

00:03:23.540 --> 00:03:23.550 
and the reason we call it a twist in as

00:03:23.550 --> 00:03:25.240 
and the reason we call it a twist in as
we<00:03:23.640> sort<00:03:23.820> of<00:03:23.850> targeted<00:03:24.300> for<00:03:24.480> 10<00:03:24.660> milligrams

00:03:25.240 --> 00:03:25.250 
we sort of targeted for 10 milligrams

00:03:25.250 --> 00:03:26.870 
we sort of targeted for 10 milligrams
truthfully<00:03:26.250> it<00:03:26.280> will<00:03:26.430> carry<00:03:26.550> a<00:03:26.700> lot<00:03:26.850> more

00:03:26.870 --> 00:03:26.880 
truthfully it will carry a lot more

00:03:26.880 --> 00:03:30.980 
truthfully it will carry a lot more
weight<00:03:28.580> so<00:03:29.580> in<00:03:29.820> a<00:03:29.880> pinch<00:03:30.090> you<00:03:30.180> get<00:03:30.390> to<00:03:30.540> put<00:03:30.630> a<00:03:30.690> 20

00:03:30.980 --> 00:03:30.990 
weight so in a pinch you get to put a 20

00:03:30.990 --> 00:03:32.720 
weight so in a pinch you get to put a 20
or<00:03:31.020> 30<00:03:31.290> pound<00:03:31.530> load<00:03:31.680> or<00:03:31.860> even<00:03:32.010> a<00:03:32.070> 50<00:03:32.370> pound<00:03:32.520> load
