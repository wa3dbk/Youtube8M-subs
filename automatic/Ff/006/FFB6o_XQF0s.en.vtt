quite<00:01:03.840> a<00:01:03.870> bit<00:01:03.930> it<00:01:04.199> probably<00:01:04.500> only<00:01:04.559> goes<00:01:04.860> into

00:01:05.509 --> 00:01:05.519 
quite a bit it probably only goes into

00:01:05.519 --> 00:01:08.090 
quite a bit it probably only goes into
my<00:01:05.640> seat<00:01:05.909> about<00:01:06.119> that<00:01:06.360> much<00:01:06.680> moving<00:01:07.680> up<00:01:07.799> front

00:01:08.090 --> 00:01:08.100 
my seat about that much moving up front

00:01:08.100 --> 00:01:12.230 
my seat about that much moving up front
I<00:01:08.369> just<00:01:08.640> have<00:01:08.939> Odyssey<00:01:09.780> Forks<00:01:10.200> and<00:01:10.909> fly<00:01:11.909> brakes

00:01:12.230 --> 00:01:12.240 
I just have Odyssey Forks and fly brakes

00:01:12.240 --> 00:01:14.570 
I just have Odyssey Forks and fly brakes
fly<00:01:12.930> brakes<00:01:13.260> front<00:01:13.500> and<00:01:13.740> rear<00:01:13.920> actually<00:01:14.430> as

00:01:14.570 --> 00:01:14.580 
fly brakes front and rear actually as

00:01:14.580 --> 00:01:16.609 
fly brakes front and rear actually as
easy<00:01:15.150> as<00:01:15.330> it<00:01:15.509> is<00:01:15.540> to<00:01:15.659> change<00:01:16.020> a<00:01:16.229> tube

00:01:16.609 --> 00:01:16.619 
easy as it is to change a tube

00:01:16.619 --> 00:01:18.200 
easy as it is to change a tube
I<00:01:16.650> can<00:01:16.860> change<00:01:17.159> take<00:01:17.310> my<00:01:17.430> front<00:01:17.670> brakes<00:01:17.850> on<00:01:18.060> and

00:01:18.200 --> 00:01:18.210 
I can change take my front brakes on and

00:01:18.210 --> 00:01:21.140 
I can change take my front brakes on and
off<00:01:18.330> so<00:01:19.250> that's<00:01:20.250> nice<00:01:20.430> if<00:01:20.640> I<00:01:20.700> don't<00:01:20.850> feel<00:01:21.000> like

00:01:21.140 --> 00:01:21.150 
off so that's nice if I don't feel like

00:01:21.150 --> 00:01:22.969 
off so that's nice if I don't feel like
riding<00:01:21.330> front<00:01:21.659> brakes<00:01:21.869> that<00:01:22.020> day<00:01:22.229> I<00:01:22.409> can<00:01:22.770> just

00:01:22.969 --> 00:01:22.979 
riding front brakes that day I can just

00:01:22.979 --> 00:01:24.649 
riding front brakes that day I can just
take<00:01:23.189> them<00:01:23.280> on<00:01:23.430> and<00:01:23.580> off<00:01:23.640> fairly<00:01:24.090> easily

00:01:24.649 --> 00:01:24.659 
take them on and off fairly easily

00:01:24.659 --> 00:01:27.530 
take them on and off fairly easily
so<00:01:25.310> moving<00:01:26.310> on<00:01:26.490> in<00:01:26.729> the<00:01:26.820> front<00:01:27.090> here<00:01:27.270> I<00:01:27.299> have<00:01:27.479> a

00:01:27.530 --> 00:01:27.540 
so moving on in the front here I have a

00:01:27.540 --> 00:01:32.200 
so moving on in the front here I have a
fly<00:01:27.810> hub<00:01:28.110> with<00:01:28.890> dk<00:01:29.250> spokes<00:01:29.610> and<00:01:30.000> a<00:01:30.329> fly<00:01:30.570> rim<00:01:30.840> and

00:01:32.200 --> 00:01:32.210 
fly hub with dk spokes and a fly rim and

00:01:32.210 --> 00:01:34.660 
fly hub with dk spokes and a fly rim and
another<00:01:32.810> we<00:01:33.020> people<00:01:33.410> pay<00:01:33.620> at<00:01:33.830> the<00:01:33.920> front<00:01:34.190> the

00:01:34.660 --> 00:01:34.670 
another we people pay at the front the

00:01:34.670 --> 00:01:37.030 
another we people pay at the front the
oldest<00:01:35.090> part<00:01:35.330> on<00:01:35.450> my<00:01:35.540> bike<00:01:35.750> and<00:01:35.960> probably<00:01:36.950> the

00:01:37.030 --> 00:01:37.040 
oldest part on my bike and probably the

00:01:37.040 --> 00:01:38.770 
oldest part on my bike and probably the
most<00:01:37.190> beat-up<00:01:37.460> would<00:01:37.820> be<00:01:37.940> my<00:01:38.090> front<00:01:38.390> hub<00:01:38.540> guard

00:01:38.770 --> 00:01:38.780 
most beat-up would be my front hub guard

00:01:38.780 --> 00:01:40.750 
most beat-up would be my front hub guard
that<00:01:38.960> I<00:01:39.020> made<00:01:39.290> using<00:01:40.010> a<00:01:40.070> rear<00:01:40.280> hub<00:01:40.490> guard

00:01:40.750 --> 00:01:40.760 
that I made using a rear hub guard

00:01:40.760 --> 00:01:43.990 
that I made using a rear hub guard
hacksaw<00:01:41.390> and<00:01:41.750> a<00:01:42.170> file<00:01:42.610> yeah<00:01:43.610> that<00:01:43.790> thing's

00:01:43.990 --> 00:01:44.000 
hacksaw and a file yeah that thing's

00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:45.580 
hacksaw and a file yeah that thing's
seen<00:01:44.270> a<00:01:44.330> lot<00:01:44.540> of<00:01:44.570> miles<00:01:44.840> but<00:01:45.200> it's<00:01:45.410> still

00:01:45.580 --> 00:01:45.590 
seen a lot of miles but it's still

00:01:45.590 --> 00:01:49.390 
seen a lot of miles but it's still
holding<00:01:45.770> up<00:01:46.070> so<00:01:46.600> handlebars<00:01:47.600> DK<00:01:48.170> grips<00:01:48.710> DK<00:01:49.100> and

00:01:49.390 --> 00:01:49.400 
holding up so handlebars DK grips DK and

00:01:49.400 --> 00:01:53.500 
holding up so handlebars DK grips DK and
then<00:01:49.580> have<00:01:50.270> to<00:01:50.420> fly<00:01:50.630> press<00:01:50.990> in<00:01:52.300> plastic<00:01:53.300> bar

00:01:53.500 --> 00:01:53.510 
then have to fly press in plastic bar

00:01:53.510 --> 00:01:56.740 
then have to fly press in plastic bar
ends<00:01:53.690> just<00:01:54.320> SST<00:01:54.800> cables<00:01:55.360> still<00:01:56.360> running<00:01:56.660> the

00:01:56.740 --> 00:01:56.750 
ends just SST cables still running the

00:01:56.750 --> 00:01:59.830 
ends just SST cables still running the
gyro<00:01:57.020> and<00:01:57.410> it's<00:01:58.130> I<00:01:58.610> actually<00:01:59.090> prefer<00:01:59.540> run<00:01:59.690> the

00:01:59.830 --> 00:01:59.840 
gyro and it's I actually prefer run the

00:01:59.840 --> 00:02:03.640 
gyro and it's I actually prefer run the
gyro<00:02:00.200> over<00:02:00.710> a<00:02:00.740> straight<00:02:01.040> cable<00:02:01.460> or<00:02:02.650> anything
