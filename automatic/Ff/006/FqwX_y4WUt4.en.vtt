00:01:39.020 --> 00:01:40.540 
really dark green to start out with and
the<00:01:39.080> trick<00:01:39.350> is<00:01:39.500> in<00:01:39.680> loading<00:01:40.010> the<00:01:40.100> brush<00:01:40.280> if<00:01:40.460> I

00:01:40.540 --> 00:01:40.550 
the trick is in loading the brush if I

00:01:40.550 --> 00:01:42.810 
the trick is in loading the brush if I
take<00:01:40.730> the<00:01:40.880> brush<00:01:41.090> Knight<00:01:41.360> tap<00:01:42.110> this<00:01:42.440> way

00:01:42.810 --> 00:01:42.820 
take the brush Knight tap this way

00:01:42.820 --> 00:01:45.880 
take the brush Knight tap this way
bending<00:01:43.820> the<00:01:43.940> bristles<00:01:44.360> up<00:01:44.510> it<00:01:45.410> explodes

00:01:45.880 --> 00:01:45.890 
bending the bristles up it explodes

00:01:45.890 --> 00:01:47.470 
bending the bristles up it explodes
those<00:01:46.130> bristles<00:01:46.430> and<00:01:46.730> opens<00:01:47.060> them<00:01:47.180> up<00:01:47.270> and<00:01:47.420> I

00:01:47.470 --> 00:01:47.480 
those bristles and opens them up and I

00:01:47.480 --> 00:01:50.410 
those bristles and opens them up and I
can<00:01:47.630> use<00:01:47.780> the<00:01:47.960> top<00:01:48.170> corner<00:01:48.710> to<00:01:48.920> shape<00:01:49.910> a<00:01:50.090> basic

00:02:04.180 --> 00:02:04.190 
leaf tree now the worst thing you can do

00:02:04.190 --> 00:02:05.710 
leaf tree now the worst thing you can do
is<00:02:04.280> put<00:02:04.460> a<00:02:04.490> complete<00:02:04.850> circle<00:02:05.240> on<00:02:05.360> there<00:02:05.570> then

00:02:05.710 --> 00:02:05.720 
is put a complete circle on there then

00:02:05.720 --> 00:02:07.090 
is put a complete circle on there then
by<00:02:05.960> the<00:02:06.050> time<00:02:06.230> you<00:02:06.320> put<00:02:06.500> the<00:02:06.590> trunk<00:02:06.830> and<00:02:07.010> it

00:02:07.090 --> 00:02:07.100 
by the time you put the trunk and it

00:02:07.100 --> 00:02:09.729 
by the time you put the trunk and it
looks<00:02:07.220> like<00:02:07.370> you've<00:02:07.490> got<00:02:07.520> a<00:02:07.670> lollipop<00:02:08.300> I<00:02:08.739> see

00:02:09.729 --> 00:02:09.739 
looks like you've got a lollipop I see

00:02:09.739 --> 00:02:11.650 
looks like you've got a lollipop I see
those<00:02:09.920> a<00:02:09.950> lot<00:02:10.220> but<00:02:10.519> the<00:02:10.640> trick<00:02:11.000> is<00:02:11.239> to<00:02:11.269> do<00:02:11.629> it

00:02:11.650 --> 00:02:11.660 
those a lot but the trick is to do it

00:02:11.660 --> 00:02:15.990 
those a lot but the trick is to do it
artsy<00:02:12.410> and<00:02:13.569> artistically<00:02:14.569> so<00:02:14.840> that<00:02:14.959> you<00:02:15.080> have

00:02:15.990 --> 00:02:16.000 
artsy and artistically so that you have

00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:18.670 
artsy and artistically so that you have
more<00:02:17.000> of<00:02:17.120> a<00:02:17.239> believable<00:02:17.810> tree<00:02:18.110> shape<00:02:18.379> and

00:02:18.670 --> 00:02:18.680 
more of a believable tree shape and

00:02:18.680 --> 00:02:20.080 
more of a believable tree shape and
don't<00:02:18.830> feel<00:02:19.160> like<00:02:19.310> you've<00:02:19.459> got<00:02:19.610> to<00:02:19.700> plug<00:02:19.910> it

00:02:20.080 --> 00:02:20.090 
don't feel like you've got to plug it

00:02:20.090 --> 00:02:22.119 
don't feel like you've got to plug it
right<00:02:20.239> in<00:02:20.420> completely<00:02:21.019> solidly<00:02:21.709> you<00:02:21.830> want<00:02:22.010> it

00:02:22.119 --> 00:02:22.129 
right in completely solidly you want it

00:02:22.129 --> 00:02:23.110 
right in completely solidly you want it
to<00:02:22.220> look<00:02:22.340> like<00:02:22.370> the<00:02:22.610> wind<00:02:22.760> could<00:02:22.940> whistle

00:02:23.110 --> 00:02:23.120 
to look like the wind could whistle

00:02:23.120 --> 00:02:24.339 
to look like the wind could whistle
through<00:02:23.450> it<00:02:23.569> and<00:02:23.660> a<00:02:23.690> bird<00:02:23.870> could<00:02:24.050> flit<00:02:24.319> through

00:02:24.339 --> 00:02:24.349 
through it and a bird could flit through

00:02:24.349 --> 00:02:27.619 
through it and a bird could flit through
now<00:02:24.709> and<00:02:24.739> then

00:02:27.619 --> 00:02:27.629 

00:02:27.629 --> 00:02:30.119 

and<00:02:28.629> if<00:02:28.870> you<00:02:28.959> back<00:02:29.200> me<00:02:29.379> into<00:02:29.410> a<00:02:29.590> corner<00:02:29.620> and<00:02:29.950> ask

00:02:30.119 --> 00:02:30.129 
and if you back me into a corner and ask

00:02:30.129 --> 00:02:32.550 
and if you back me into a corner and ask
me<00:02:30.340> is<00:02:30.580> this<00:02:30.760> an<00:02:30.910> oak<00:02:31.090> tree<00:02:31.120> or<00:02:31.450> an<00:02:31.720> elm<00:02:31.900> tree<00:02:32.019> or

00:02:32.550 --> 00:02:32.560 
me is this an oak tree or an elm tree or

00:02:32.560 --> 00:02:35.009 
me is this an oak tree or an elm tree or
a<00:02:32.590> maple<00:02:33.069> tree<00:02:33.099> or<00:02:33.370> whatever<00:02:33.519> I<00:02:33.940> can't<00:02:34.870> really

00:02:35.009 --> 00:02:35.019 
a maple tree or whatever I can't really

00:02:35.019 --> 00:02:36.509 
a maple tree or whatever I can't really
tell<00:02:35.319> you<00:02:35.379> I'm<00:02:35.620> not<00:02:35.650> this<00:02:36.010> is<00:02:36.069> more<00:02:36.400> or<00:02:36.459> less

00:02:36.509 --> 00:02:36.519 
tell you I'm not this is more or less

00:02:36.519 --> 00:02:38.820 
tell you I'm not this is more or less
just<00:02:36.760> a<00:02:36.879> generic<00:02:37.030> tree<00:02:37.930> with<00:02:38.110> leaves<00:02:38.290> on<00:02:38.590> it<00:02:38.739> if

00:02:38.820 --> 00:02:38.830 
just a generic tree with leaves on it if

00:02:38.830 --> 00:02:41.250 
just a generic tree with leaves on it if
I<00:02:38.950> were<00:02:38.980> doing<00:02:39.280> something<00:02:39.489> specific<00:02:40.239> I'd<00:02:41.019> want

00:02:41.250 --> 00:02:41.260 
I were doing something specific I'd want

00:02:41.260 --> 00:02:42.540 
I were doing something specific I'd want
to<00:02:41.319> either<00:02:41.410> go<00:02:41.650> out<00:02:41.739> on<00:02:41.890> location<00:02:42.099> and

00:02:42.540 --> 00:02:42.550 
to either go out on location and

00:02:42.550 --> 00:02:44.220 
to either go out on location and
actually<00:02:42.879> look<00:02:43.150> at<00:02:43.239> a<00:02:43.300> maple<00:02:43.660> tree<00:02:43.690> or<00:02:44.049> have<00:02:44.200> a

00:02:44.220 --> 00:02:44.230 
actually look at a maple tree or have a

00:02:44.230 --> 00:02:47.250 
actually look at a maple tree or have a
photo<00:02:44.620> of<00:02:44.860> one<00:02:45.480> that<00:02:46.480> I'd<00:02:46.599> gotten<00:02:46.840> ahold<00:02:47.080> of

00:02:47.250 --> 00:02:47.260 
photo of one that I'd gotten ahold of

00:02:47.260 --> 00:02:48.780 
photo of one that I'd gotten ahold of
just<00:02:47.530> because<00:02:47.980> they<00:02:48.099> do<00:02:48.160> have<00:02:48.430> their<00:02:48.640> own

00:02:48.780 --> 00:02:48.790 
just because they do have their own

00:02:48.790 --> 00:02:51.960 
just because they do have their own
characteristic<00:02:49.540> shape<00:02:49.810> and<00:02:50.049> whatnot<00:02:50.790> so<00:02:51.790> this

00:02:51.960 --> 00:02:51.970 
characteristic shape and whatnot so this

00:02:51.970 --> 00:02:55.110 
characteristic shape and whatnot so this
is<00:02:52.090> more<00:02:52.269> or<00:02:52.299> less<00:02:52.390> kind<00:02:52.720> of<00:02:52.810> generic<00:02:54.060> but<00:02:55.060> a

00:02:55.110 --> 00:02:55.120 
is more or less kind of generic but a

00:02:55.120 --> 00:02:57.750 
is more or less kind of generic but a
tree<00:02:55.480> like<00:02:55.660> this<00:02:55.690> is<00:02:55.989> like<00:02:56.140> a<00:02:56.170> sandwich<00:02:56.760> think

00:02:57.750 --> 00:02:57.760 
tree like this is like a sandwich think

00:02:57.760 --> 00:02:59.309 
tree like this is like a sandwich think
of<00:02:57.849> it<00:02:57.970> as<00:02:58.090> two<00:02:58.330> slices<00:02:58.599> of<00:02:58.810> bread<00:02:58.930> with<00:02:59.290> a

00:02:59.309 --> 00:02:59.319 
of it as two slices of bread with a

00:02:59.319 --> 00:03:02.759 
of it as two slices of bread with a
filler<00:02:59.650> in<00:02:59.860> between<00:03:01.319> this<00:03:02.319> is<00:03:02.380> going<00:03:02.650> to<00:03:02.709> be

00:03:02.759 --> 00:03:02.769 
filler in between this is going to be

00:03:02.769 --> 00:03:04.800 
filler in between this is going to be
the<00:03:02.890> back<00:03:03.130> slice<00:03:03.549> this<00:03:03.819> is<00:03:04.000> the<00:03:04.150> bottom<00:03:04.480> slice

00:03:04.800 --> 00:03:04.810 
the back slice this is the bottom slice

00:03:04.810 --> 00:03:06.600 
the back slice this is the bottom slice
of<00:03:05.019> the<00:03:05.079> tree<00:03:05.260> if<00:03:05.319> you<00:03:05.380> build<00:03:05.680> it<00:03:05.799> from<00:03:05.950> back<00:03:06.280> to

00:03:06.600 --> 00:03:06.610 
of the tree if you build it from back to

00:03:06.610 --> 00:03:09.479 
of the tree if you build it from back to
middle<00:03:07.090> to<00:03:07.120> front<00:03:07.650> like<00:03:08.650> it<00:03:08.829> actually<00:03:09.310> is

00:03:09.479 --> 00:03:09.489 
middle to front like it actually is

00:03:09.489 --> 00:03:11.069 
middle to front like it actually is
constructed<00:03:10.150> in<00:03:10.269> the<00:03:10.360> way<00:03:10.480> that<00:03:10.900> you're

00:03:11.069 --> 00:03:11.079 
constructed in the way that you're

00:03:11.079 --> 00:03:13.650 
constructed in the way that you're
viewing<00:03:11.290> it<00:03:11.500> from<00:03:11.739> it<00:03:12.670> will<00:03:12.819> come<00:03:13.030> out<00:03:13.060> much

00:03:13.650 --> 00:03:13.660 
viewing it from it will come out much

00:03:13.660 --> 00:03:16.170 
viewing it from it will come out much
better<00:03:13.959> I<00:03:14.319> find<00:03:14.709> people<00:03:15.069> do<00:03:15.190> it<00:03:15.310> a<00:03:15.519> lot<00:03:16.030> of

00:03:16.170 --> 00:03:16.180 
better I find people do it a lot of

00:03:16.180 --> 00:03:18.569 
better I find people do it a lot of
other<00:03:16.299> ways<00:03:16.510> but<00:03:16.959> that<00:03:17.769> tends<00:03:18.040> to<00:03:18.160> work<00:03:18.370> best

00:03:18.569 --> 00:03:18.579 
other ways but that tends to work best

00:03:18.579 --> 00:03:19.680 
other ways but that tends to work best
now<00:03:18.819> see<00:03:18.970> I'm<00:03:19.030> just<00:03:19.209> trying<00:03:19.390> to<00:03:19.420> make<00:03:19.510> sure<00:03:19.660> I

00:03:19.680 --> 00:03:19.690 
now see I'm just trying to make sure I

00:03:19.690 --> 00:03:22.199 
now see I'm just trying to make sure I
don't<00:03:19.810> get<00:03:19.989> a<00:03:20.049> round<00:03:20.260> lollipop<00:03:20.920> I'm<00:03:21.849> making

00:03:22.199 --> 00:03:22.209 
don't get a round lollipop I'm making

00:03:22.209 --> 00:03:25.259 
don't get a round lollipop I'm making
sure<00:03:22.390> that<00:03:22.569> some<00:03:22.870> of<00:03:23.019> the<00:03:23.760> branches<00:03:24.760> hang<00:03:25.120> out

00:03:25.259 --> 00:03:25.269 
sure that some of the branches hang out

00:03:25.269 --> 00:03:27.030 
sure that some of the branches hang out
a<00:03:25.299> little<00:03:25.540> further<00:03:25.900> than<00:03:26.079> others<00:03:26.560> just<00:03:26.590> make

00:03:27.030 --> 00:03:27.040 
a little further than others just make

00:03:27.040 --> 00:03:32.190 
a little further than others just make
it<00:03:27.190> asymmetrical<00:03:30.480> okay<00:03:31.480> that<00:03:31.690> looks<00:03:31.959> like<00:03:32.139> a

00:03:32.190 --> 00:03:32.200 
it asymmetrical okay that looks like a

00:03:32.200 --> 00:03:34.080 
it asymmetrical okay that looks like a
believable<00:03:32.650> tree<00:03:33.040> to<00:03:33.220> me<00:03:33.340> as<00:03:33.549> far<00:03:33.970> as<00:03:34.000> the

00:03:34.080 --> 00:03:34.090 
believable tree to me as far as the

00:03:34.090 --> 00:03:37.110 
believable tree to me as far as the
shape<00:03:34.859> now<00:03:35.859> we<00:03:35.889> need<00:03:36.100> to<00:03:36.190> put<00:03:36.340> a<00:03:36.370> trunk<00:03:36.790> in<00:03:36.940> that

00:03:37.110 --> 00:03:37.120 
shape now we need to put a trunk in that

00:03:37.120 --> 00:03:39.420 
shape now we need to put a trunk in that
a<00:03:37.500> few<00:03:38.500> different<00:03:38.799> ways<00:03:38.889> of<00:03:39.069> doing<00:03:39.160> that<00:03:39.370> I

00:03:39.420 --> 00:03:39.430 
a few different ways of doing that I

00:03:39.430 --> 00:03:40.860 
a few different ways of doing that I
could<00:03:39.670> use<00:03:39.790> a<00:03:39.819> pallet<00:03:40.239> knife<00:03:40.269> or<00:03:40.510> I<00:03:40.569> could<00:03:40.750> use

00:03:40.860 --> 00:03:40.870 
could use a pallet knife or I could use

00:03:40.870 --> 00:03:42.330 
could use a pallet knife or I could use
a<00:03:40.900> brush<00:03:41.200> I<00:03:41.440> think<00:03:41.590> today<00:03:41.799> I'll<00:03:41.889> use<00:03:42.040> a<00:03:42.069> brush

00:03:42.330 --> 00:03:42.340 
a brush I think today I'll use a brush

00:03:42.340 --> 00:03:45.180 
a brush I think today I'll use a brush
liner<00:03:42.910> brush<00:03:43.209> I've<00:03:44.079> got<00:03:44.260> a<00:03:44.290> can<00:03:44.620> of<00:03:44.650> paint

00:03:45.180 --> 00:03:45.190 
liner brush I've got a can of paint

00:03:45.190 --> 00:03:47.670 
liner brush I've got a can of paint
thinner<00:03:45.310> over<00:03:45.639> here<00:03:45.849> then<00:03:46.000> dipping<00:03:46.329> into<00:03:46.480> if<00:03:47.019> I

00:03:47.670 --> 00:03:47.680 
thinner over here then dipping into if I

00:03:47.680 --> 00:03:50.789 
thinner over here then dipping into if I
take<00:03:47.889> burnt<00:03:48.160> sienna<00:03:48.579> and<00:03:48.910> white<00:03:49.720> and<00:03:50.049> a<00:03:50.530> little

00:03:50.789 --> 00:03:50.799 
take burnt sienna and white and a little

00:03:50.799 --> 00:03:52.259 
take burnt sienna and white and a little
bit<00:03:50.920> of<00:03:51.040> ultramarine<00:03:51.160> blue<00:03:51.549> I<00:03:51.819> can<00:03:52.060> get<00:03:52.239> a

00:03:52.259 --> 00:03:52.269 
bit of ultramarine blue I can get a

00:03:52.269 --> 00:03:56.069 
bit of ultramarine blue I can get a
grayish<00:03:52.870> Brown<00:03:54.269> and<00:03:55.269> you<00:03:55.599> want<00:03:55.780> something

00:03:56.069 --> 00:03:56.079 
grayish Brown and you want something

00:03:56.079 --> 00:03:57.750 
grayish Brown and you want something
that's<00:03:56.169> going<00:03:56.349> to<00:03:56.440> correspond<00:03:57.040> in<00:03:57.220> contrast

00:03:57.750 --> 00:03:57.760 
that's going to correspond in contrast

00:03:57.760 --> 00:03:59.309 
that's going to correspond in contrast
with<00:03:57.940> your<00:03:58.090> tree<00:03:58.269> color<00:03:58.480> that's<00:03:58.720> pretty<00:03:58.989> dark

00:03:59.309 --> 00:03:59.319 
with your tree color that's pretty dark

00:03:59.319 --> 00:04:01.589 
with your tree color that's pretty dark
so<00:04:00.250> I've<00:04:00.370> either<00:04:00.519> got<00:04:00.639> to<00:04:00.880> go<00:04:01.000> much<00:04:01.389> much

00:04:01.589 --> 00:04:01.599 
so I've either got to go much much

00:04:01.599 --> 00:04:03.509 
so I've either got to go much much
darker<00:04:02.109> or<00:04:02.290> go<00:04:02.530> a<00:04:02.560> little<00:04:02.739> lighter<00:04:02.980> so<00:04:03.310> it'll

00:04:03.509 --> 00:04:03.519 
darker or go a little lighter so it'll

00:04:03.519 --> 00:04:06.870 
darker or go a little lighter so it'll
show<00:04:03.549> up<00:04:04.239> if<00:04:05.230> I<00:04:05.380> draw<00:04:05.709> a<00:04:06.040> trunk<00:04:06.459> down<00:04:06.669> through

00:04:06.870 --> 00:04:06.880 
show up if I draw a trunk down through

00:04:06.880 --> 00:04:08.400 
show up if I draw a trunk down through
now<00:04:07.030> it's<00:04:07.209> not<00:04:07.359> going<00:04:07.540> to<00:04:07.599> show<00:04:07.780> too<00:04:07.840> well<00:04:08.139> so<00:04:08.349> I

00:04:08.400 --> 00:04:08.410 
now it's not going to show too well so I

00:04:08.410 --> 00:04:10.699 
now it's not going to show too well so I
think<00:04:08.470> I'm<00:04:08.650> going<00:04:08.799> to<00:04:08.859> go<00:04:08.950> a<00:04:08.980> much<00:04:09.280> darker<00:04:09.579> and

00:04:10.699 --> 00:04:10.709 
think I'm going to go a much darker and

00:04:10.709 --> 00:04:13.199 
think I'm going to go a much darker and
I<00:04:11.709> think<00:04:11.919> that'll<00:04:12.190> translate<00:04:12.549> to<00:04:12.819> the<00:04:12.910> video<00:04:13.180> a

00:04:13.199 --> 00:04:13.209 
I think that'll translate to the video a

00:04:13.209 --> 00:04:15.140 
I think that'll translate to the video a
little<00:04:13.540> better

00:04:15.140 --> 00:04:15.150 
little better

00:04:15.150 --> 00:04:17.969 
little better
not<00:04:16.150> all<00:04:16.329> trunks<00:04:16.750> have<00:04:16.930> or<00:04:17.410> not<00:04:17.560> all<00:04:17.709> trees

00:04:17.969 --> 00:04:17.979 
not all trunks have or not all trees

00:04:17.979 --> 00:04:19.589 
not all trunks have or not all trees
have<00:04:18.130> dark<00:04:18.370> trunks<00:04:18.760> you<00:04:18.849> can<00:04:19.000> go<00:04:19.120> lighter<00:04:19.389> on

00:04:19.589 --> 00:04:19.599 
have dark trunks you can go lighter on

00:04:19.599 --> 00:04:21.569 
have dark trunks you can go lighter on
some<00:04:19.810> of<00:04:19.870> these<00:04:19.959> but<00:04:20.139> you'll<00:04:20.289> have<00:04:20.470> to<00:04:20.680> adjust

00:04:21.569 --> 00:04:21.579 
some of these but you'll have to adjust

00:04:21.579 --> 00:04:23.550 
some of these but you'll have to adjust
your<00:04:21.820> value<00:04:22.270> of<00:04:22.300> your<00:04:22.599> I've<00:04:22.870> got<00:04:23.080> a<00:04:23.110> darker

00:04:23.550 --> 00:04:23.560 
your value of your I've got a darker

00:04:23.560 --> 00:04:25.080 
your value of your I've got a darker
gray<00:04:23.740> there<00:04:23.950> you'll<00:04:24.400> have<00:04:24.520> to<00:04:24.639> adjust<00:04:24.940> the

00:04:25.080 --> 00:04:25.090 
gray there you'll have to adjust the

00:04:25.090 --> 00:04:27.240 
gray there you'll have to adjust the
value<00:04:25.450> of<00:04:25.599> your<00:04:25.750> foliage<00:04:26.260> they're<00:04:26.830> not<00:04:27.010> going

00:04:29.610 --> 00:04:29.620 
to show and see I do it intermittently I

00:04:29.620 --> 00:04:31.110 
to show and see I do it intermittently I
don't<00:04:29.860> do<00:04:30.070> it<00:04:30.190> all<00:04:30.400> the<00:04:30.610> way<00:04:30.729> through<00:04:30.760> you're

00:04:31.110 --> 00:04:31.120 
don't do it all the way through you're

00:04:31.120 --> 00:04:32.490 
don't do it all the way through you're
not<00:04:31.150> going<00:04:31.360> to<00:04:31.419> see<00:04:31.630> the<00:04:31.750> whole<00:04:31.930> trunk<00:04:32.260> it's

00:04:32.490 --> 00:04:32.500 
not going to see the whole trunk it's

00:04:32.500 --> 00:04:33.719 
not going to see the whole trunk it's
going<00:04:32.620> to<00:04:32.680> be<00:04:32.770> shrouded<00:04:33.220> in<00:04:33.310> some<00:04:33.550> of<00:04:33.639> these

00:04:33.719 --> 00:04:33.729 
going to be shrouded in some of these

00:04:33.729 --> 00:04:36.810 
going to be shrouded in some of these
leaves<00:04:34.289> if<00:04:35.289> I<00:04:35.409> pull<00:04:35.710> the<00:04:36.039> trunk<00:04:36.340> down<00:04:36.520> like

00:04:36.810 --> 00:04:36.820 
leaves if I pull the trunk down like

00:04:36.820 --> 00:04:38.760 
leaves if I pull the trunk down like
this<00:04:37.240> and<00:04:37.599> you<00:04:37.719> will<00:04:37.810> obviously<00:04:38.169> have<00:04:38.500> land

00:04:38.760 --> 00:04:38.770 
this and you will obviously have land

00:04:38.770 --> 00:04:39.640 
this and you will obviously have land
down<00:04:38.979> here<00:04:39.039> somewhere

00:04:39.640 --> 00:04:39.650 
down here somewhere

00:04:39.650 --> 00:04:41.290 
down here somewhere
to<00:04:39.860> complete<00:04:40.250> your<00:04:40.280> landscape<00:04:40.850> whatever<00:04:41.150> that

00:04:41.290 --> 00:04:41.300 
to complete your landscape whatever that

00:04:41.300 --> 00:04:43.810 
to complete your landscape whatever that
happens<00:04:41.630> to<00:04:41.780> be<00:04:41.810> and<00:04:42.560> a<00:04:43.130> lot<00:04:43.250> of<00:04:43.400> these<00:04:43.490> trees

00:04:43.810 --> 00:04:43.820 
happens to be and a lot of these trees

00:04:43.820 --> 00:04:45.189 
happens to be and a lot of these trees
well<00:04:44.030> they're<00:04:44.360> going<00:04:44.509> to<00:04:44.630> the<00:04:44.720> trunk<00:04:44.960> is<00:04:45.050> going

00:04:45.189 --> 00:04:45.199 
well they're going to the trunk is going

00:04:45.199 --> 00:04:47.860 
well they're going to the trunk is going
to<00:04:45.259> be<00:04:45.320> fairly<00:04:45.590> wide<00:04:45.860> at<00:04:46.070> the<00:04:46.100> base<00:04:46.840> some<00:04:47.840> of

00:04:47.860 --> 00:04:47.870 
to be fairly wide at the base some of

00:04:47.870 --> 00:04:50.350 
to be fairly wide at the base some of
them<00:04:48.110> will<00:04:48.259> have<00:04:48.289> more<00:04:48.770> than<00:04:48.830> one<00:04:49.160> trunk<00:04:49.520> kind

00:04:50.350 --> 00:04:50.360 
them will have more than one trunk kind

00:04:50.360 --> 00:04:53.050 
them will have more than one trunk kind
of<00:04:50.479> jutting<00:04:50.870> off<00:04:51.050> like<00:04:51.320> this<00:04:51.850> what<00:04:52.850> really

00:04:53.050 --> 00:04:53.060 
of jutting off like this what really

00:04:53.060 --> 00:04:55.120 
of jutting off like this what really
makes<00:04:53.419> this<00:04:53.630> work<00:04:53.900> is<00:04:54.139> when<00:04:54.380> we<00:04:54.500> highlight<00:04:54.740> it

00:04:55.120 --> 00:04:55.130 
makes this work is when we highlight it

00:04:55.130 --> 00:04:57.240 
makes this work is when we highlight it
that's<00:04:55.340> really<00:04:56.090> what<00:04:56.270> brings<00:04:56.539> it<00:04:56.690> together

00:04:57.240 --> 00:04:57.250 
that's really what brings it together

00:04:57.250 --> 00:04:59.860 
that's really what brings it together
now<00:04:58.250> I've<00:04:58.340> got<00:04:58.520> this<00:04:58.639> paint<00:04:58.910> pretty<00:04:59.389> thin<00:04:59.660> with

00:04:59.860 --> 00:04:59.870 
now I've got this paint pretty thin with

00:04:59.870 --> 00:05:01.150 
now I've got this paint pretty thin with
paint<00:05:00.110> thinner<00:05:00.259> thinned<00:05:00.650> down<00:05:00.740> to<00:05:00.889> a<00:05:00.919> very

00:05:01.150 --> 00:05:01.160 
paint thinner thinned down to a very

00:05:01.160 --> 00:05:05.110 
paint thinner thinned down to a very
thin<00:05:01.220> consistency<00:05:03.280> if<00:05:04.280> you<00:05:04.400> draw<00:05:04.639> some<00:05:05.000> of

00:05:05.110 --> 00:05:05.120 
thin consistency if you draw some of

00:05:05.120 --> 00:05:08.080 
thin consistency if you draw some of
these<00:05:05.180> limbs<00:05:05.570> on<00:05:06.310> and<00:05:07.310> I'm<00:05:07.580> going<00:05:07.699> to<00:05:07.789> go<00:05:07.880> back

these limbs on and I'm going to go back
to<00:05:08.120> that<00:05:08.389> same<00:05:08.720> foliage<00:05:09.410> brush<00:05:09.710> that<00:05:09.919> I<00:05:10.009> just

00:05:10.220 --> 00:05:13.570 
to that same foliage brush that I just
had<00:05:11.380> I'll<00:05:12.380> wipe<00:05:12.620> it<00:05:12.740> off<00:05:12.919> a<00:05:12.949> little<00:05:13.190> bit<00:05:13.340> on<00:05:13.460> a

that<00:05:16.940> darker<00:05:17.360> paint<00:05:17.570> out<00:05:17.810> of<00:05:17.870> it<00:05:19.449> if<00:05:20.449> I<00:05:20.539> pick<00:05:20.750> up

00:05:20.890 --> 00:05:20.900 
that darker paint out of it if I pick up

00:05:20.900 --> 00:05:23.590 
that darker paint out of it if I pick up
some<00:05:21.110> white<00:05:21.470> a<00:05:21.970> little<00:05:22.970> bit<00:05:23.060> of<00:05:23.150> cadmium

00:05:23.590 --> 00:05:23.600 
some white a little bit of cadmium

00:05:23.600 --> 00:05:26.200 
some white a little bit of cadmium
yellow<00:05:23.720> a<00:05:24.430> little<00:05:25.430> bit<00:05:25.550> of<00:05:25.639> straight<00:05:25.910> SAP

00:05:26.200 --> 00:05:26.210 
yellow a little bit of straight SAP

00:05:26.210 --> 00:05:27.610 
yellow a little bit of straight SAP
green<00:05:26.419> just<00:05:26.780> anything<00:05:27.139> that's<00:05:27.289> a<00:05:27.380> brighter

00:05:27.610 --> 00:05:27.620 
green just anything that's a brighter

00:05:27.620 --> 00:05:29.590 
green just anything that's a brighter
color<00:05:27.889> obviously<00:05:28.250> if<00:05:28.760> you're<00:05:28.880> using<00:05:29.120> fall

00:05:29.590 --> 00:05:29.600 
color obviously if you're using fall

00:05:29.600 --> 00:05:31.000 
color obviously if you're using fall
colors<00:05:30.020> you<00:05:30.110> wouldn't<00:05:30.289> be<00:05:30.350> using<00:05:30.500> these<00:05:30.740> you

00:05:31.000 --> 00:05:31.010 
colors you wouldn't be using these you

00:05:31.010 --> 00:05:32.980 
colors you wouldn't be using these you
could<00:05:31.520> base<00:05:31.699> this<00:05:31.940> in<00:05:32.090> with<00:05:32.210> burnt<00:05:32.479> umber<00:05:32.660> or

00:05:32.980 --> 00:05:32.990 
could base this in with burnt umber or

00:05:32.990 --> 00:05:34.689 
could base this in with burnt umber or
burnt<00:05:33.229> sienna<00:05:33.620> at<00:05:33.860> this<00:05:34.010> point<00:05:34.280> and<00:05:34.460> then<00:05:34.550> use

00:05:34.689 --> 00:05:34.699 
burnt sienna at this point and then use

00:05:34.699 --> 00:05:36.400 
burnt sienna at this point and then use
a<00:05:34.729> lighter<00:05:35.060> orange<00:05:35.510> or<00:05:35.630> yellow<00:05:35.810> over<00:05:36.080> the<00:05:36.199> top

00:05:36.400 --> 00:05:36.410 
a lighter orange or yellow over the top

00:05:36.410 --> 00:05:38.980 
a lighter orange or yellow over the top
would<00:05:37.190> give<00:05:37.340> you<00:05:37.430> a<00:05:37.460> fall<00:05:37.759> foliage<00:05:38.000> and<00:05:38.419> I'm

00:05:38.980 --> 00:05:38.990 
would give you a fall foliage and I'm

00:05:38.990 --> 00:05:40.689 
would give you a fall foliage and I'm
loading<00:05:39.349> the<00:05:39.470> brush<00:05:39.650> basically<00:05:40.250> the<00:05:40.340> same<00:05:40.550> way

00:05:40.689 --> 00:05:40.699 
loading the brush basically the same way

00:05:40.699 --> 00:05:42.730 
loading the brush basically the same way
as<00:05:40.820> I<00:05:40.940> did<00:05:41.000> before<00:05:41.240> opening<00:05:42.080> the<00:05:42.199> bristles<00:05:42.590> so

00:05:42.730 --> 00:05:42.740 
as I did before opening the bristles so

00:05:42.740 --> 00:05:44.800 
as I did before opening the bristles so
they're<00:05:42.889> nice<00:05:43.160> and<00:05:43.430> open<00:05:43.760> and<00:05:44.449> if<00:05:44.539> I<00:05:44.630> use<00:05:44.780> just

00:05:44.800 --> 00:05:44.810 
they're nice and open and if I use just

00:05:44.810 --> 00:05:48.010 
they're nice and open and if I use just
the<00:05:45.169> top<00:05:45.380> corner<00:05:45.830> of<00:05:45.889> the<00:05:45.979> brush<00:05:46.840> I'm<00:05:47.840> going<00:05:47.960> to

00:05:48.010 --> 00:05:48.020 
the top corner of the brush I'm going to

00:05:48.020 --> 00:05:49.629 
the top corner of the brush I'm going to
go<00:05:48.139> a<00:05:48.169> little<00:05:48.440> bit<00:05:48.770> lighter<00:05:48.979> than<00:05:49.099> that<00:05:49.280> so<00:05:49.580> you

00:05:49.629 --> 00:05:49.639 
go a little bit lighter than that so you

00:05:49.639 --> 00:05:50.830 
go a little bit lighter than that so you
can<00:05:49.760> see<00:05:49.940> that<00:05:50.120> a<00:05:50.150> little<00:05:50.389> easier<00:05:50.510> to<00:05:50.720> make

00:05:50.830 --> 00:05:50.840 
can see that a little easier to make

00:05:50.840 --> 00:05:53.850 
can see that a little easier to make
sure<00:05:50.960> that<00:05:51.169> shows<00:05:51.410> up<00:05:51.590> as<00:05:51.710> a<00:05:51.740> contrast<00:05:52.250> for<00:05:52.580> you

00:05:53.850 --> 00:05:53.860 
sure that shows up as a contrast for you

00:05:53.860 --> 00:05:57.490 
sure that shows up as a contrast for you
I'm<00:05:54.860> using<00:05:55.220> just<00:05:55.460> the<00:05:55.580> corner<00:05:56.030> and<00:05:56.810> I'm

00:05:57.490 --> 00:05:57.500 
I'm using just the corner and I'm

00:05:57.500 --> 00:05:59.710 
I'm using just the corner and I'm
dabbing<00:05:57.949> on<00:05:58.070> some<00:05:58.580> of<00:05:58.760> the<00:05:58.880> boughs<00:05:59.180> and

00:05:59.710 --> 00:05:59.720 
dabbing on some of the boughs and

00:05:59.720 --> 00:06:02.830 
dabbing on some of the boughs and
branches<00:06:00.349> leave<00:06:01.310> darkness<00:06:02.000> within<00:06:02.360> that<00:06:02.510> tree

00:06:02.830 --> 00:06:02.840 
branches leave darkness within that tree

00:06:02.840 --> 00:06:04.390 
branches leave darkness within that tree
if<00:06:02.960> you<00:06:02.990> lose<00:06:03.260> all<00:06:03.530> of<00:06:03.560> that<00:06:03.860> dark<00:06:04.130> in<00:06:04.310> the

00:06:04.390 --> 00:06:04.400 
if you lose all of that dark in the

00:06:04.400 --> 00:06:06.370 
if you lose all of that dark in the
middle<00:06:04.490> of<00:06:04.729> the<00:06:04.820> tree<00:06:05.090> it<00:06:05.389> becomes<00:06:05.750> flat<00:06:05.960> again

00:06:06.370 --> 00:06:06.380 
middle of the tree it becomes flat again

00:06:06.380 --> 00:06:08.680 
middle of the tree it becomes flat again
let's<00:06:07.159> say<00:06:07.280> I<00:06:07.340> laid<00:06:07.550> down<00:06:07.580> the<00:06:07.760> back<00:06:08.150> slice<00:06:08.479> of

00:06:08.680 --> 00:06:08.690 
let's say I laid down the back slice of

00:06:08.690 --> 00:06:10.540 
let's say I laid down the back slice of
bread<00:06:08.780> I<00:06:09.110> put<00:06:09.169> the<00:06:09.650> filling<00:06:10.220> in<00:06:10.340> the<00:06:10.430> middle

00:06:10.540 --> 00:06:10.550 
bread I put the filling in the middle

00:06:10.550 --> 00:06:13.390 
bread I put the filling in the middle
which<00:06:10.789> is<00:06:10.820> the<00:06:10.970> trunk<00:06:11.500> and<00:06:12.500> now<00:06:13.070> I'm<00:06:13.190> going<00:06:13.340> to

00:06:13.390 --> 00:06:13.400 
which is the trunk and now I'm going to

00:06:13.400 --> 00:06:15.339 
which is the trunk and now I'm going to
add<00:06:13.610> the<00:06:14.120> other<00:06:14.270> slice<00:06:14.630> of<00:06:14.659> bread<00:06:14.840> over<00:06:15.229> the

00:06:15.339 --> 00:06:15.349 
add the other slice of bread over the

00:06:15.349 --> 00:06:16.839 
add the other slice of bread over the
top<00:06:15.590> and<00:06:15.830> you'll<00:06:15.949> see<00:06:16.190> that<00:06:16.340> that<00:06:16.520> gives<00:06:16.729> that

00:06:16.839 --> 00:06:16.849 
top and you'll see that that gives that

00:06:16.849 --> 00:06:18.760 
top and you'll see that that gives that
a<00:06:16.970> really<00:06:17.810> three-dimensional<00:06:18.680> appearance

00:06:18.760 --> 00:06:18.770 
a really three-dimensional appearance

00:06:18.770 --> 00:06:21.490 
a really three-dimensional appearance
just<00:06:19.430> like<00:06:19.610> a<00:06:19.639> tree<00:06:19.940> is<00:06:20.240> because<00:06:21.110> that's

00:06:21.490 --> 00:06:21.500 
just like a tree is because that's

00:06:21.500 --> 00:06:23.320 
just like a tree is because that's
actually<00:06:22.130> how<00:06:22.250> they're<00:06:22.460> constructed<00:06:23.060> and<00:06:23.240> how

00:06:23.320 --> 00:06:23.330 
actually how they're constructed and how

00:06:23.330 --> 00:06:25.060 
actually how they're constructed and how
you<00:06:23.389> view<00:06:23.810> them<00:06:23.960> in<00:06:24.199> nature<00:06:24.530> when<00:06:24.710> you<00:06:24.800> look<00:06:24.949> at

00:06:25.060 --> 00:06:25.070 
you view them in nature when you look at

00:06:25.070 --> 00:06:27.070 
you view them in nature when you look at
a<00:06:25.099> tree<00:06:25.370> you're<00:06:26.120> seeing<00:06:26.449> it<00:06:26.570> from<00:06:26.720> front<00:06:26.990> to

00:06:27.070 --> 00:06:27.080 
a tree you're seeing it from front to

00:06:27.080 --> 00:06:31.360 
a tree you're seeing it from front to
back<00:06:27.320> and<00:06:27.590> see<00:06:27.830> through<00:06:28.159> to<00:06:28.370> the<00:06:28.400> backside<00:06:30.370> see

00:06:31.360 --> 00:06:31.370 
back and see through to the backside see

00:06:31.370 --> 00:06:34.480 
back and see through to the backside see
that<00:06:31.520> works<00:06:31.699> very<00:06:32.030> well<00:06:32.830> gives<00:06:33.830> you<00:06:33.949> a<00:06:34.010> pretty

00:06:34.480 --> 00:06:34.490 
that works very well gives you a pretty

00:06:34.490 --> 00:06:38.170 
that works very well gives you a pretty
realistic<00:06:34.880> looking<00:06:35.270> tree<00:06:37.030> you<00:06:38.030> could

00:06:38.170 --> 00:06:38.180 
realistic looking tree you could

00:06:38.180 --> 00:06:39.700 
realistic looking tree you could
actually<00:06:38.419> throw<00:06:38.780> a<00:06:38.870> little<00:06:39.110> bit<00:06:39.260> of<00:06:39.349> hot<00:06:39.530> light

00:06:39.700 --> 00:06:39.710 
actually throw a little bit of hot light

00:06:39.710 --> 00:06:41.800 
actually throw a little bit of hot light
on<00:06:39.889> the<00:06:39.979> trunk<00:06:40.280> obviously<00:06:40.909> if<00:06:41.449> I<00:06:41.570> took<00:06:41.630> some

00:06:41.800 --> 00:06:41.810 
on the trunk obviously if I took some

00:06:41.810 --> 00:06:45.730 
on the trunk obviously if I took some
white<00:06:42.349> and<00:06:42.770> into<00:06:43.729> my<00:06:43.960> trunk<00:06:44.960> color<00:06:45.289> you<00:06:45.590> can

00:06:45.730 --> 00:06:45.740 
white and into my trunk color you can

00:06:45.740 --> 00:06:47.740 
white and into my trunk color you can
have<00:06:45.889> depending<00:06:46.669> on<00:06:46.760> which<00:06:46.970> direction<00:06:47.419> your

00:06:47.740 --> 00:06:47.750 
have depending on which direction your

00:06:47.750 --> 00:06:49.150 
have depending on which direction your
light<00:06:47.960> source<00:06:48.169> is<00:06:48.380> coming<00:06:48.409> from<00:06:48.710> left

00:06:49.150 --> 00:06:49.160 
light source is coming from left

00:06:49.160 --> 00:06:50.440 
light source is coming from left
right<00:06:49.460> you<00:06:49.610> can<00:06:49.760> put<00:06:49.970> a<00:06:50.000> little<00:06:50.120> bit<00:06:50.270> of<00:06:50.360> a

00:06:50.440 --> 00:06:50.450 
right you can put a little bit of a

00:06:50.450 --> 00:06:58.470 
right you can put a little bit of a
highlight<00:06:50.780> on<00:06:50.840> there<00:06:51.250> with<00:06:52.250> no<00:06:52.400> problem<00:06:57.250> and

00:06:58.470 --> 00:06:58.480 
highlight on there with no problem and

00:06:58.480 --> 00:07:01.510 
highlight on there with no problem and
you<00:06:59.480> would<00:06:59.900> complete<00:07:00.380> your<00:07:00.680> land<00:07:01.040> whatever

00:07:01.510 --> 00:07:01.520 
you would complete your land whatever

happens to be in your landscape

00:07:03.140 --> 00:07:07.810 
happens to be in your landscape
accordingly<00:07:06.040> Pinker<00:07:07.040> that<00:07:07.190> down<00:07:07.430> on<00:07:07.610> the
