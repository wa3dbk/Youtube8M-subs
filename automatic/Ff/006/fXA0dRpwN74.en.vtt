00:00:02.310 --> 00:00:11.700
 do not 

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:14.250
 [Music] 

00:00:11.700 --> 00:00:17.400
 Hydrive free at the request of a subscriber 

00:00:14.250 --> 00:00:20.460
 who asked me for the game of zelda of cars and 

00:00:17.400 --> 00:00:23.400
 ocarina of time for this game is not 

00:00:20.460 --> 00:00:26.550
 for android but what I bring you today 

00:00:23.400 --> 00:00:29.460
 is a modulator that runs those games 

00:00:26.550 --> 00:00:31.020
 before what they are going to do is download 

00:00:29.460 --> 00:00:32.920
 I can leave this emulator in the 

00:00:31.020 --> 00:00:34.820
 description 

00:00:32.920 --> 00:00:36.710
 we get 

00:00:34.820 --> 00:00:37.700
 as for the emulator also the game 

00:00:36.710 --> 00:00:41.220
 I'm going to leave it down in the 

00:00:37.700 --> 00:00:43.440
 description to the first to be killed 

00:00:41.220 --> 00:00:47.190
 It will seem somewhat let down 

00:00:43.440 --> 00:00:49.650
 reach 100 percent then we come 

00:00:47.190 --> 00:00:53.040
 here is going to see a folder where it says 

00:00:49.650 --> 00:00:54.810
 game you choose the game and what 

00:00:53.040 --> 00:00:58.350
 they put in any folder that you 

00:00:54.810 --> 00:01:01.040
 want it or leave it lying on the outside in 

00:00:58.350 --> 00:01:05.280
 football as such at the base of 

00:01:01.040 --> 00:01:07.500
 storage of your phone 

00:01:05.280 --> 00:01:09.510
 after that happens they give him over 

00:01:07.500 --> 00:01:11.580
 game and it will appear here they give to 

00:01:09.510 --> 00:01:14.060
 start the emulation and they give in 

00:01:11.580 --> 00:01:14.060
 resume 

00:01:17.280 --> 00:01:21.860
 quickie let's pass the fire 

00:01:26.250 --> 00:01:30.650
 let's play the game with its different 

00:01:28.320 --> 00:01:30.650
 controls 

00:01:36.030 --> 00:01:39.170
 [Music] 

00:01:40.409 --> 00:01:44.789
 it's running slow to me obviously 

00:01:42.630 --> 00:01:48.710
 because I'm recording from the same 

00:01:44.789 --> 00:01:48.710
 phone and I'm running some new 

00:01:48.820 --> 00:01:54.070
 but I passed it on the table and it has 

00:01:51.610 --> 00:01:56.390
 run just fine 

00:01:54.070 --> 00:01:58.020
 here you give him 

00:01:56.390 --> 00:02:01.100
 Over there 

00:01:58.020 --> 00:02:01.100
 your name 

00:02:01.120 --> 00:02:08.259
 and I do not know what value is a little man and not 

00:02:04.880 --> 00:02:11.489
 I come here then they are 

00:02:08.259 --> 00:02:16.079
 And there begins the story is how 

00:02:11.489 --> 00:02:16.079
 in the forest pasture 

00:02:18.800 --> 00:02:23.770
 and here they come 

00:02:21.130 --> 00:02:25.200
 but look look less less you 

00:02:23.770 --> 00:02:27.780
 dan 

00:02:25.200 --> 00:02:30.420
 here is the button here to the 

00:02:27.780 --> 00:02:32.010
 back 

00:02:30.420 --> 00:02:35.220
 here will appear more options give you 

00:02:32.010 --> 00:02:36.810
 they keep and they go back to their departure as 

00:02:35.220 --> 00:02:40.080
 suppose they want to save it in another 

00:02:36.810 --> 00:02:42.530
 they had good in leaving him alone what 

00:02:40.080 --> 00:02:42.530
 changes 

00:02:42.910 --> 00:02:46.970
 and I come back like this we give him to save and the 

00:02:45.520 --> 00:02:49.970
 guardians 

00:02:46.970 --> 00:02:52.430
 and calm then when they want they come back 

00:02:49.970 --> 00:02:53.720
 and want to play from here and do not have 

00:02:52.430 --> 00:02:56.240
 to start obviously from the 

00:02:53.720 --> 00:03:00.110
 principle they open the emulator they open the 

00:02:56.240 --> 00:03:03.830
 game and they give to load and there they go to 

00:03:00.110 --> 00:03:05.630
 see the lots that you have saved and 

00:03:03.830 --> 00:03:07.070
 well nothing is all 

00:03:05.630 --> 00:03:09.320
 here any more thing to leave in the 

00:03:07.070 --> 00:03:13.680
 comments the application that you 

00:03:09.320 --> 00:03:18.290
