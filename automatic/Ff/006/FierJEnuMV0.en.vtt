 good come training is a therapeutic approach is adolfo stayed 

00:00:45.360 --> 00:00:49.820
 percent is a therapeutic approach aimed essentially at children with 

00:00:49.820 --> 00:00:53.280
 because they have a disorder called autistic disorder or 

00:00:53.280 --> 00:00:55.820
 autism spectrum disorders 

00:00:55.820 --> 00:00:58.820
 another this will not generate any development 

00:00:59.530 --> 00:01:02.660
 an approach while applying another pathology proved what has been 

00:01:03.310 --> 00:01:07.730
 proved to be one of the most effective approaches to work with this type of 

00:01:07.730 --> 00:01:08.800
 children 

00:01:08.800 --> 00:01:11.120
 in front of you a country that in 

00:01:11.120 --> 00:01:14.060
 autism and also this technique 

00:01:14.060 --> 00:01:17.480
 Raise them to comment a bit on what autism is 

00:01:17.480 --> 00:01:22.560
 comes autism is a pathology called that essentially affects a 

00:01:22.560 --> 00:01:24.440
 child in three levels of 

00:01:24.440 --> 00:01:26.590
 essential weapons at the 

00:01:26.590 --> 00:01:29.230
 of the language of communication 

00:01:29.230 --> 00:01:32.590
 at the level of socialization and behavioral level 

00:01:33.570 --> 00:01:34.490
 these assets 

00:01:34.490 --> 00:01:36.219
 As for the technique 

00:01:36.219 --> 00:01:41.530
 will shelter sharks tdt is expert how to achieve those trucks etc. 

00:01:41.530 --> 00:01:45.920
 in modifying the behavior of the patient this pathology the autism 

00:01:45.920 --> 00:01:49.890
 it was considered for a long time let's say intractable say 

00:01:49.890 --> 00:01:53.540
 for these children they were considered to be unable to improve 

00:01:54.070 --> 00:01:58.040
 then to the fifties for example in the united states directly 

00:01:58.040 --> 00:01:59.860
 recommended admission 

00:01:59.860 --> 00:02:00.820
 percent 

00:02:00.820 --> 00:02:04.150
 I am a child hundreds and communicative believers the probability that 

00:02:04.150 --> 00:02:08.179
 have aggression behaviors or behaviors such as varnish or behavior 

00:02:08.179 --> 00:02:11.179
 self-harm increases because children want 

00:02:12.089 --> 00:02:15.479
 for example, they want to ask for something but since they do not know how to do it 

00:02:15.479 --> 00:02:20.239
 schuessler react of both of them with a distress with a situation of 

00:02:20.239 --> 00:02:24.419
 nervousness of a lot of anxiety they get very nervous and there it starts as a 

00:02:24.419 --> 00:02:25.629
 circle 

00:02:25.629 --> 00:02:29.170
 then all these problems added 

00:02:29.170 --> 00:02:33.150
 to the serious problems they may have at the level of adherence to the driver 

00:02:33.150 --> 00:02:36.290
 progressive have traditionally been considered as a 

00:02:36.290 --> 00:02:37.689
 problem of which 

00:02:37.689 --> 00:02:39.939
 there was not much to do 

00:02:39.939 --> 00:02:41.639
 for one hundrerd 

00:02:41.639 --> 00:02:45.840
 thank god we come from the decade of the 80 a series is published 

00:02:45.839 --> 00:02:49.219
 of works in the United States that show that there is a therapy that 

00:02:49.219 --> 00:02:51.229
 chama efe 

00:02:51.229 --> 00:02:53.509
 cerati that's why now 

00:02:53.509 --> 00:02:58.769
 I really want work let's see to improve the quality of life of these 

00:02:58.769 --> 00:03:02.829
 children and try to improve a lot in the symptomatology that this child has 

00:03:03.499 --> 00:03:06.499
 but good unfortunately in Latin America 

00:03:06.999 --> 00:03:11.829
 is not widespread does masters therapy there are few places where 

00:03:11.829 --> 00:03:12.769
 practice 

00:03:12.769 --> 00:03:14.200
 is a therapy that 

00:03:14.200 --> 00:03:17.200
 it spread rather in the united states and in countries 

00:03:17.779 --> 00:03:20.419
 percent in gauging in england fa 

00:03:20.419 --> 00:03:24.760
 between Latin countries and Latin American countries do not have as much 

00:03:24.759 --> 00:03:27.499
 knowledge 

00:03:27.499 --> 00:03:29.579
 so good the idea of 

00:03:29.579 --> 00:03:31.789
 fig tree dessein 

00:03:31.789 --> 00:03:35.359
 here in valledupar in colombia will begin to spread 

00:03:35.359 --> 00:03:38.349
 more than this therapeutic approach islamabad 

00:03:38.349 --> 00:03:42.629
 but you have also published on their books especially directed 

00:03:42.629 --> 00:03:47.019
 to supplies in that sense what kind of strategies is recommended for 

00:03:47.019 --> 00:03:51.059
 that are not boys can take advantage of the free time west well they are 

00:03:51.059 --> 00:03:53.479
 Realities published a book on Saturday 

00:03:53.479 --> 00:03:54.390
 this 

00:03:54.390 --> 00:03:59.300
 we understood that he escaped oriented to dad to astrada the entities 

00:03:59.300 --> 00:04:00.359
 and there are people who do 

00:04:00.359 --> 00:04:01.229
 that this one 

00:04:01.229 --> 00:04:05.749
 let's say percent is just like entering in this field are a live 

00:04:05.749 --> 00:04:08.659
 introductory so that the one you do not have or in any 

00:04:08.659 --> 00:04:10.710
 ideal approach now 

00:04:10.710 --> 00:04:15.390
 can read it and can be introduced in this in this approach expressed the essay 

00:04:15.390 --> 00:04:18.580
 introduction to the park the approach now let's look for autism and disorder 

00:04:18.580 --> 00:04:19.620
 developing 

00:04:19.620 --> 00:04:23.159
 Here we really have children who are very legitimate 1 

00:04:23.159 --> 00:04:27.090
 heir really do a very thorough analysis to be able to issue a 

00:04:27.089 --> 00:04:30.580
 diagnosis and girls who have a very very severe problem 

00:04:30.580 --> 00:04:34.300
 then it is difficult to give general recommendations but my recommendation more 

00:04:34.300 --> 00:04:35.240
 that to teachers 

00:04:35.240 --> 00:04:38.180
 is father has to do with 

00:04:38.180 --> 00:04:41.770
 age we look for detection of this kind of problem 

00:04:42.430 --> 00:04:47.720
 as teachers as dads of love should be very attentive to various signs 

00:04:47.720 --> 00:04:48.979
 indicators 

00:04:48.979 --> 00:04:54.259
 the absence of stamped the absence of language or 

00:04:54.259 --> 00:04:56.919
 simple words a year and five months 

00:04:56.919 --> 00:05:00.379
 the loss of language masters has decided 

00:05:00.379 --> 00:05:05.360
 or the delay in language acquisition were in general signs of 

00:05:05.360 --> 00:05:09.759
 alarm that should be done by parents immediately consult a doctor 

00:05:11.110 --> 00:05:15.319
 the pediatrician first but I can not do it feasible is in charge of diagnosing 

00:05:15.319 --> 00:05:16.449
 these problems 

00:05:16.449 --> 00:05:18.090
 so that you can 

00:05:18.090 --> 00:05:21.439
 make the diagnosis in that therapy as soon as possible 

00:05:21.439 --> 00:05:22.759
 why 

00:05:22.759 --> 00:05:27.000
 because if you can diagnose autism in the two years that up your top mind 

00:05:26.999 --> 00:05:28.580
 they give the one that is diagnosed 

00:05:28.580 --> 00:05:31.990
 then therapy can start very early 

00:05:31.990 --> 00:05:36.220
 and the results that can be had with this type of children are very much 

00:05:36.220 --> 00:05:37.089
 greater 

00:05:37.089 --> 00:05:41.210
 however, it is important that these guys can buy regular Laura 

00:05:41.759 --> 00:05:45.529
 it is perfectly possible that they can do it in love but in others it is not 

00:05:45.529 --> 00:05:46.639
 all or 

00:05:46.639 --> 00:05:50.409
 we are going to have a group of children that will need special education 

00:05:50.409 --> 00:05:51.470
 for one hundrerd 

00:05:51.470 --> 00:05:54.759
 while we have been children that will be able to be integrated 

00:05:54.759 --> 00:05:58.919
 but here you also have to see the age of onset of therapy while 

00:05:58.919 --> 00:06:02.779
 before initials of which greater possibilities to pose capabilities 

00:06:02.779 --> 00:06:04.169
 who have these children 

00:06:04.169 --> 00:06:07.570
 and more serious possibility of integrating it in a conventional classroom 

00:06:08.909 --> 00:06:12.909
 equal to grinding reality that general at least the Latin American countries 

00:06:12.909 --> 00:06:16.110
 I know I do not know Colombia yet because it's done 

00:06:16.629 --> 00:06:18.509
 by the way sale hours 

00:06:18.509 --> 00:06:20.469
 percent 

00:06:20.469 --> 00:06:23.469
 the reality is that discrimination was more evident 

00:06:24.020 --> 00:06:29.129
 Mendez who on special occasions or in therapeutic educational centers but 

00:06:29.129 --> 00:06:31.979
 things do not start therapy time for therapy 

00:06:31.979 --> 00:06:36.360
 is not effective based on the fact that the child is not given the therapy that 

00:06:36.360 --> 00:06:37.659
 needs to 

00:06:37.659 --> 00:06:40.969
 these children no no conventional therapies yes 

00:06:41.589 --> 00:06:46.289
 not usually effective, you need a therapy with a specific focus like 

00:06:46.289 --> 00:06:50.110
 is Spain is going to be much more beneficial and the probability of 

00:06:50.109 --> 00:06:52.430
 that can be integrated 

00:06:52.430 --> 00:06:53.509
 a bull 

00:06:53.509 --> 00:06:57.479
 of children eat are going to be much more we do not want to thank immensely here 

00:06:57.479 --> 00:06:58.960
 all claudio who do 

00:06:58.960 --> 00:07:01.499
 all that echoes that knowledge here 

00:07:01.499 --> 00:07:03.909
 and in valledupar capital of the department of cesar 

00:07:03.909 --> 00:07:08.430
 did not tell me then how good it has allowed us to spread the events 

00:07:08.430 --> 00:07:12.940
 that organizes the ebony zénica the recent threat dorine diana de ceni 

00:07:13.509 --> 00:07:14.840
 that allow me 

00:07:14.840 --> 00:07:16.729
 come to 

00:07:16.729 --> 00:07:19.759
 your people will be trained 

00:07:19.759 --> 00:07:23.210
 Of course they are the scientific echoes that we have here 

00:07:23.210 --> 00:07:25.540
 at the state dinner around the soldiers
