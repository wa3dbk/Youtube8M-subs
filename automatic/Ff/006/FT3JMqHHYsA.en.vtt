00:00:05.480 --> 00:00:05.490 
couple of changes i think would be great

00:00:05.490 --> 00:00:07.160 
couple of changes i think would be great
for<00:00:05.700> advanced<00:00:05.970> warfare<00:00:06.420> things<00:00:06.960> that

00:00:07.160 --> 00:00:07.170 
for advanced warfare things that

00:00:07.170 --> 00:00:08.990 
for advanced warfare things that
sledgehammer<00:00:07.470> can<00:00:07.950> do<00:00:08.069> themselves<00:00:08.220> to<00:00:08.820> make

00:00:08.990 --> 00:00:09.000 
sledgehammer can do themselves to make

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:10.669 
sledgehammer can do themselves to make
the<00:00:09.179> game<00:00:09.660> a<00:00:09.690> better<00:00:09.929> experience<00:00:10.290> for<00:00:10.469> not

00:00:10.669 --> 00:00:10.679 
the game a better experience for not

00:00:10.679 --> 00:00:12.350 
the game a better experience for not
only<00:00:10.769> the<00:00:10.889> competitive<00:00:11.490> players<00:00:11.730> but<00:00:12.240> the

00:00:12.350 --> 00:00:12.360 
only the competitive players but the

00:00:12.360 --> 00:00:14.240 
only the competitive players but the
public<00:00:12.540> players<00:00:12.990> as<00:00:13.139> well<00:00:13.170> i<00:00:13.559> think<00:00:13.980> if<00:00:14.190> you

00:00:14.240 --> 00:00:14.250 
public players as well i think if you

00:00:14.250 --> 00:00:16.700 
public players as well i think if you
look<00:00:14.309> at<00:00:14.639> the<00:00:14.820> way<00:00:15.260> advanced<00:00:16.260> warfare<00:00:16.350> is

00:00:16.700 --> 00:00:16.710 
look at the way advanced warfare is

00:00:16.710 --> 00:00:17.990 
look at the way advanced warfare is
going<00:00:16.980> right<00:00:17.100> now<00:00:17.250> i<00:00:17.279> think<00:00:17.430> there's<00:00:17.730> a<00:00:17.850> lot<00:00:17.970> of

00:00:17.990 --> 00:00:18.000 
going right now i think there's a lot of

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:19.490 
going right now i think there's a lot of
things<00:00:18.210> that<00:00:18.420> need<00:00:19.020> to<00:00:19.050> change<00:00:19.109> and<00:00:19.439> i<00:00:19.470> think

00:00:19.490 --> 00:00:19.500 
things that need to change and i think

00:00:19.500 --> 00:00:21.290 
things that need to change and i think
that<00:00:19.800> i<00:00:19.830> mean<00:00:20.010> the<00:00:20.130> game<00:00:20.250> itself<00:00:20.550> is<00:00:20.730> amazing<00:00:21.150> i

00:00:21.290 --> 00:00:21.300 
that i mean the game itself is amazing i

00:00:21.300 --> 00:00:23.240 
that i mean the game itself is amazing i
think<00:00:21.720> that<00:00:22.410> we<00:00:22.560> could<00:00:22.680> make<00:00:23.010> the<00:00:23.100> game<00:00:23.220> better

00:00:23.240 --> 00:00:23.250 
think that we could make the game better

00:00:23.250 --> 00:00:25.279 
think that we could make the game better
and<00:00:23.760> that's<00:00:23.820> why<00:00:24.119> I'm<00:00:24.180> tried<00:00:24.390> to<00:00:24.570> try<00:00:24.900> suggest

00:00:25.279 --> 00:00:25.289 
and that's why I'm tried to try suggest

00:00:25.289 --> 00:00:27.830 
and that's why I'm tried to try suggest
things<00:00:25.470> I'm<00:00:26.039> all<00:00:26.279> going<00:00:26.430> to<00:00:26.490> be<00:00:26.609> a<00:00:26.970> dick<00:00:27.359> in<00:00:27.570> I'm

00:00:27.830 --> 00:00:27.840 
things I'm all going to be a dick in I'm

00:00:27.840 --> 00:00:30.259 
things I'm all going to be a dick in I'm
the<00:00:28.109> way<00:00:28.199> I<00:00:28.230> look<00:00:28.500> at<00:00:28.619> things<00:00:28.769> is<00:00:29.010> if<00:00:29.250> you<00:00:30.119> don't

00:00:30.259 --> 00:00:30.269 
the way I look at things is if you don't

00:00:30.269 --> 00:00:33.229 
the way I look at things is if you don't
ask<00:00:30.359> you<00:00:30.510> don't<00:00:30.570> get<00:00:30.840> and<00:00:31.050> if<00:00:31.850> we<00:00:32.850> can<00:00:33.059> suggest

00:00:33.229 --> 00:00:33.239 
ask you don't get and if we can suggest

00:00:33.239 --> 00:00:35.330 
ask you don't get and if we can suggest
these<00:00:33.600> changes<00:00:34.050> to<00:00:34.140> advanced<00:00:34.380> warfare<00:00:34.980> two

00:00:35.330 --> 00:00:35.340 
these changes to advanced warfare two

00:00:35.340 --> 00:00:36.920 
these changes to advanced warfare two
sledgehammer<00:00:35.850> and<00:00:36.120> there<00:00:36.540> are<00:00:36.630> things<00:00:36.660> that

00:00:36.920 --> 00:00:36.930 
sledgehammer and there are things that

00:00:36.930 --> 00:00:38.240 
sledgehammer and there are things that
they<00:00:37.110> believed<00:00:37.440> they<00:00:37.620> could<00:00:37.649> effects<00:00:37.980> pretty

00:00:38.240 --> 00:00:38.250 
they believed they could effects pretty

00:00:38.250 --> 00:00:39.920 
they believed they could effects pretty
easily<00:00:38.430> and<00:00:38.730> it's<00:00:39.120> worth<00:00:39.270> their<00:00:39.450> time<00:00:39.660> and<00:00:39.809> it

00:00:39.920 --> 00:00:39.930 
easily and it's worth their time and it

00:00:39.930 --> 00:00:41.450 
easily and it's worth their time and it
can<00:00:40.050> improve<00:00:40.290> the<00:00:40.500> game<00:00:40.620> if<00:00:40.829> a<00:00:41.160> lot<00:00:41.309> of<00:00:41.340> people

00:00:41.450 --> 00:00:41.460 
can improve the game if a lot of people

00:00:41.460 --> 00:00:43.490 
can improve the game if a lot of people
asking<00:00:42.059> for<00:00:42.120> this<00:00:42.300> as<00:00:42.420> well<00:00:42.450> I<00:00:42.899> think<00:00:43.320> that

00:00:43.490 --> 00:00:43.500 
asking for this as well I think that

00:00:43.500 --> 00:00:45.170 
asking for this as well I think that
they're<00:00:43.770> gonna<00:00:44.309> do<00:00:44.520> it<00:00:44.610> they<00:00:44.730> only<00:00:44.910> want<00:00:45.149> the

00:00:45.170 --> 00:00:45.180 
they're gonna do it they only want the

00:00:45.180 --> 00:00:46.369 
they're gonna do it they only want the
game<00:00:45.360> to<00:00:45.390> be<00:00:45.539> a<00:00:45.629> better<00:00:45.870> experience<00:00:46.140> for

00:00:46.369 --> 00:00:46.379 
game to be a better experience for

00:00:46.379 --> 00:00:48.860 
game to be a better experience for
everyone<00:00:46.829> and<00:00:47.129> as<00:00:47.700> far<00:00:47.910> as<00:00:47.969> what<00:00:48.539> I've<00:00:48.629> seen<00:00:48.809> so

four players but for spectators so first

00:01:08.010 --> 00:01:10.550

of all looking eye emoji Columbus so I'm

00:01:10.560 --> 00:01:12.500 
of all looking eye emoji Columbus so I'm
gonna<00:01:10.890> take<00:01:11.040> a<00:01:11.130> lot<00:01:11.310> of<00:01:11.340> examples<00:01:11.700> from<00:01:12.090> that<00:01:12.330> I

00:01:12.500 --> 00:01:12.510 
gonna take a lot of examples from that I

00:01:12.510 --> 00:01:14.859 
gonna take a lot of examples from that I
think<00:01:13.140> obviously<00:01:13.320> first<00:01:13.979> of<00:01:14.130> all<00:01:14.250> the

00:01:14.859 --> 00:01:14.869 
think obviously first of all the

00:01:14.869 --> 00:01:16.880 
think obviously first of all the
broadcaster<00:01:15.869> boat<00:01:16.020> leaves<00:01:16.650> a<00:01:16.710> lot<00:01:16.830> of

00:01:16.880 --> 00:01:16.890 
broadcaster boat leaves a lot of

00:01:16.890 --> 00:01:18.770 
broadcaster boat leaves a lot of
improvements<00:01:17.460> i<00:01:17.520> think<00:01:17.700> the<00:01:17.880> the<00:01:18.600> use<00:01:18.750> of

00:01:18.770 --> 00:01:18.780 
improvements i think the the use of

00:01:18.780 --> 00:01:22.219 
improvements i think the the use of
different<00:01:19.619> colors<00:01:19.979> on<00:01:20.340> and<00:01:20.820> the<00:01:21.630> cod<00:01:21.840> caster

00:01:22.219 --> 00:01:22.229 
different colors on and the cod caster

00:01:22.229 --> 00:01:24.020 
different colors on and the cod caster
gets<00:01:22.409> very<00:01:22.560> confusing<00:01:22.710> usually<00:01:23.610> when<00:01:23.909> you're

00:01:24.020 --> 00:01:24.030 
gets very confusing usually when you're

00:01:24.030 --> 00:01:25.969 
gets very confusing usually when you're
spectin<00:01:24.450> someone<00:01:24.810> if<00:01:25.020> the<00:01:25.259> other<00:01:25.470> team<00:01:25.740> was<00:01:25.830> on

00:01:25.969 --> 00:01:25.979 
spectin someone if the other team was on

00:01:25.979 --> 00:01:28.550 
spectin someone if the other team was on
the<00:01:26.130> hardpoint<00:01:26.909> you'd<00:01:27.450> see<00:01:27.659> and<00:01:27.840> read<00:01:28.049> by<00:01:28.290> was

00:01:28.550 --> 00:01:28.560 
the hardpoint you'd see and read by was

00:01:28.560 --> 00:01:31.280 
the hardpoint you'd see and read by was
dependent<00:01:29.070> on<00:01:29.159> who<00:01:30.000> was<00:01:30.450> in<00:01:30.689> the<00:01:30.840> hardpoint

00:01:31.280 --> 00:01:31.290 
dependent on who was in the hardpoint

00:01:31.290 --> 00:01:32.270 
dependent on who was in the hardpoint
and<00:01:31.439> stuff<00:01:31.590> for<00:01:31.710> that<00:01:31.860> it<00:01:31.979> was<00:01:32.070> pretty

00:01:32.270 --> 00:01:32.280 
and stuff for that it was pretty

00:01:32.280 --> 00:01:33.980 
and stuff for that it was pretty
confusing<00:01:32.670> to<00:01:32.820> watch<00:01:32.970> in<00:01:33.180> my<00:01:33.240> opinion<00:01:33.720> i<00:01:33.960> think

00:01:33.980 --> 00:01:33.990 
confusing to watch in my opinion i think

00:01:33.990 --> 00:01:36.800 
confusing to watch in my opinion i think
that<00:01:34.950> they<00:01:35.490> should<00:01:35.520> just<00:01:35.729> revert<00:01:36.150> that<00:01:36.180> sort

00:01:36.800 --> 00:01:36.810 
that they should just revert that sort

00:01:36.810 --> 00:01:38.060 
that they should just revert that sort
of<00:01:36.840> thing<00:01:36.930> to<00:01:37.229> the<00:01:37.350> way<00:01:37.439> it<00:01:37.560> used<00:01:37.740> to<00:01:37.920> be

00:01:38.060 --> 00:01:38.070 
of thing to the way it used to be

00:01:38.070 --> 00:01:40.510 
of thing to the way it used to be
hardpoint<00:01:38.880> tamer<00:01:39.210> also<00:01:39.540> needs<00:01:39.720> to<00:01:39.840> be<00:01:39.930> there

00:01:40.510 --> 00:01:40.520 
hardpoint tamer also needs to be there

00:01:40.520 --> 00:01:42.319 
hardpoint tamer also needs to be there
there<00:01:41.520> is<00:01:41.640> to<00:01:41.729> be<00:01:41.759> a<00:01:41.820> couple<00:01:42.000> of<00:01:42.150> other

00:01:42.319 --> 00:01:42.329 
there is to be a couple of other

00:01:42.329 --> 00:01:46.010 
there is to be a couple of other
features<00:01:42.509> as<00:01:42.810> well<00:01:42.840> um<00:01:44.149> but<00:01:45.149> tomorrow's<00:01:45.930> I

00:01:46.010 --> 00:01:46.020 
features as well um but tomorrow's I

00:01:46.020 --> 00:01:47.899 
features as well um but tomorrow's I
think<00:01:46.170> casters<00:01:46.619> have<00:01:46.770> got<00:01:46.950> Baron<00:01:47.340> say<00:01:47.520> to<00:01:47.579> that

00:01:47.899 --> 00:01:47.909 
think casters have got Baron say to that

00:01:47.909 --> 00:01:50.090 
think casters have got Baron say to that
but<00:01:48.149> those<00:01:48.270> are<00:01:48.360> the<00:01:48.630> main<00:01:48.810> ones<00:01:48.840> that<00:01:49.409> the<00:01:49.950> I'd

00:03:07.020 --> 00:03:07.030 
and all that sounds very like dramatic

00:03:07.030 --> 00:03:08.970 
and all that sounds very like dramatic
but<00:03:07.629> just<00:03:07.840> think<00:03:07.930> of<00:03:08.079> it<00:03:08.170> this<00:03:08.230> way<00:03:08.349> imagine

but just think of it this way imagine

00:03:08.980 --> 00:03:13.770 
but just think of it this way imagine
like<00:03:09.930> one<00:03:10.930> team<00:03:11.260> loses<00:03:11.590> a<00:03:12.780> potential

should not be able to bounce like I seen
someone<00:03:46.060> completely<00:03:46.660> messed<00:03:47.230> up<00:03:47.440> blank

00:04:02.379 --> 00:04:04.680 
but those sort of any consistencies can
happen<00:04:02.799> like<00:04:02.980> I<00:04:03.220> can't<00:04:03.669> begin<00:04:03.819> to<00:04:03.970> stress<00:04:04.359> like

that's the luxury to saves people's

00:04:06.370 --> 00:04:08.309 
that's the luxury to saves people's
life's<00:04:06.579> these<00:04:06.849> results<00:04:07.269> like<00:04:07.480> it's<00:04:07.750> so<00:04:07.930> like<00:04:08.139> I

00:04:08.309 --> 00:04:08.319 
life's these results like it's so like I

00:04:08.319 --> 00:04:10.020 
life's these results like it's so like I
said<00:04:08.440> before<00:04:08.620> it<00:04:08.889> sounds<00:04:09.190> rather<00:04:09.400> dramatic

00:04:10.020 --> 00:04:10.030 
said before it sounds rather dramatic

00:04:10.030 --> 00:04:13.559 
said before it sounds rather dramatic
but<00:04:10.720> it<00:04:11.079> does<00:04:11.379> that<00:04:11.760> like<00:04:12.760> there's<00:04:13.239> actually

00:04:13.559 --> 00:04:13.569 
but it does that like there's actually

00:04:13.569 --> 00:04:15.599 
but it does that like there's actually
such<00:04:13.840> an<00:04:14.079> importance<00:04:14.590> on<00:04:14.829> results<00:04:15.370> and

00:04:15.599 --> 00:04:15.609 
such an importance on results and

00:04:15.609 --> 00:04:17.370 
such an importance on results and
they're<00:04:16.150> seen<00:04:16.419> it<00:04:16.720> could<00:04:16.900> result<00:04:17.079> what<00:04:17.289> up

00:04:17.370 --> 00:04:17.380 
they're seen it could result what up

00:04:17.380 --> 00:04:19.110 
they're seen it could result what up
we're<00:04:17.590> being<00:04:17.799> dropped<00:04:18.099> there's<00:04:18.760> just<00:04:18.849> so<00:04:19.030> many

00:04:19.110 --> 00:04:19.120 
we're being dropped there's just so many

00:04:19.120 --> 00:04:20.849 
we're being dropped there's just so many
variables<00:04:19.539> and<00:04:19.870> tell<00:04:20.049> when<00:04:20.199> I<00:04:20.229> lost<00:04:20.560> that<00:04:20.709> you

00:04:20.849 --> 00:04:20.859 
variables and tell when I lost that you

00:04:20.859 --> 00:04:22.529 
variables and tell when I lost that you
gotta<00:04:21.070> think<00:04:21.250> about<00:04:21.430> and<00:04:21.760> there<00:04:22.180> just<00:04:22.210> can't

00:04:22.529 --> 00:04:22.539 
gotta think about and there just can't

00:04:22.539 --> 00:04:24.460 
gotta think about and there just can't
be<00:04:22.750> this<00:04:22.990> inconsistency<00:04:23.590> there

00:04:24.460 --> 00:04:24.470 
be this inconsistency there

00:04:24.470 --> 00:04:29.200 
be this inconsistency there
be<00:04:25.750> this<00:04:26.750> sort<00:04:27.350> of<00:04:27.410> luck<00:04:27.800> in<00:04:28.100> the<00:04:28.640> timing<00:04:29.060> based

00:04:29.200 --> 00:04:29.210 
be this sort of luck in the timing based

00:04:29.210 --> 00:04:32.110 
be this sort of luck in the timing based
nature<00:04:29.750> that<00:04:30.260> has<00:04:30.650> pop<00:04:31.190> like<00:04:31.400> at<00:04:31.580> the<00:04:31.730> minute<00:04:31.970> I

00:04:32.110 --> 00:04:32.120 
nature that has pop like at the minute I

00:04:32.120 --> 00:04:34.810 
nature that has pop like at the minute I
think<00:04:32.510> also<00:04:32.690> the<00:04:33.230> UPIKE<00:04:33.740> player<00:04:34.490> needs<00:04:34.760> to

00:04:34.810 --> 00:04:34.820 
think also the UPIKE player needs to

00:04:34.820 --> 00:04:36.460 
think also the UPIKE player needs to
have<00:04:34.910> a<00:04:34.940> constant<00:04:35.270> kill<00:04:35.780> st.<00:04:36.020> above<00:04:36.230> his<00:04:36.350> head

00:04:36.460 --> 00:04:36.470 
have a constant kill st. above his head

00:04:36.470 --> 00:04:38.830 
have a constant kill st. above his head
nor<00:04:36.710> are<00:04:36.830> not<00:04:37.370> a<00:04:37.400> delayed<00:04:37.730> one<00:04:37.970> I<00:04:38.120> am<00:04:38.420> there's<00:04:38.810> a

00:04:38.830 --> 00:04:38.840 
nor are not a delayed one I am there's a

00:04:38.840 --> 00:04:39.820 
nor are not a delayed one I am there's a
lot<00:04:38.990> a<00:04:39.020> couple<00:04:39.260> of<00:04:39.320> things<00:04:39.500> I'd<00:04:39.650> like<00:04:39.770> to

00:04:39.820 --> 00:04:39.830 
lot a couple of things I'd like to

00:04:39.830 --> 00:04:44.200 
lot a couple of things I'd like to
suggest<00:04:41.950> but<00:04:42.950> honestly<00:04:43.310> the<00:04:43.820> other<00:04:43.910> things

00:04:44.200 --> 00:04:44.210 
suggest but honestly the other things

00:04:44.210 --> 00:04:45.100 
suggest but honestly the other things
are<00:04:44.360> probably<00:04:44.570> pretty<00:04:44.720> much<00:04:44.870> up<00:04:45.020> for

00:04:45.100 --> 00:04:45.110 
are probably pretty much up for

00:04:45.110 --> 00:04:47.680 
are probably pretty much up for
discussion<00:04:45.380> I<00:04:45.860> think<00:04:46.490> CTF<00:04:47.000> right<00:04:47.300> now<00:04:47.420> needs

00:04:47.680 --> 00:04:47.690 
discussion I think CTF right now needs

00:04:47.690 --> 00:04:51.220 
discussion I think CTF right now needs
to<00:04:47.780> be<00:04:47.960> changed<00:04:48.350> to<00:04:48.710> 7.5<00:04:49.400> respawn<00:04:49.940> a<00:04:50.170> lot<00:04:51.170> of

00:04:51.220 --> 00:04:51.230 
to be changed to 7.5 respawn a lot of

00:04:51.230 --> 00:04:53.200 
to be changed to 7.5 respawn a lot of

down you can come off spawn and you can

00:05:00.710 --> 00:05:02.950

coat recap by overextending because due

00:05:02.960 --> 00:05:04.090 
coat recap by overextending because due
to<00:05:03.080> the<00:05:03.140> nature<00:05:03.260> of<00:05:03.410> the<00:05:03.470> spawns<00:05:03.770> and<00:05:03.920> stuff

to the nature of the spawns and stuff

00:05:04.100 --> 00:05:05.860 
to the nature of the spawns and stuff
for<00:05:04.190> that<00:05:04.340> and<00:05:04.670> it's<00:05:04.850> harder<00:05:05.210> for<00:05:05.240> the<00:05:05.600> players

00:05:05.860 --> 00:05:05.870 
for that and it's harder for the players

00:05:05.870 --> 00:05:08.680 
for that and it's harder for the players
to<00:05:06.140> dead<00:05:06.290> dictate<00:05:06.980> spawns<00:05:07.340> because<00:05:07.760> you<00:05:08.390> spawn

00:05:08.680 --> 00:05:08.690 
to dead dictate spawns because you spawn

00:05:08.690 --> 00:05:10.510 
to dead dictate spawns because you spawn
so<00:05:08.990> fast<00:05:09.260> that<00:05:09.470> when<00:05:09.680> people<00:05:09.830> get<00:05:10.040> four<00:05:10.340> down

00:05:10.510 --> 00:05:10.520 
so fast that when people get four down

00:05:10.520 --> 00:05:12.940 
so fast that when people get four down
they<00:05:11.030> can't<00:05:11.240> move<00:05:11.540> to<00:05:11.990> block<00:05:12.380> a<00:05:12.410> spawn<00:05:12.800> or

00:05:12.940 --> 00:05:12.950 
they can't move to block a spawn or

00:05:12.950 --> 00:05:15.040 
they can't move to block a spawn or
something<00:05:13.220> laughs<00:05:13.490> fast<00:05:14.210> enough<00:05:14.600> because<00:05:14.750> the

00:05:15.040 --> 00:05:15.050 
something laughs fast enough because the

00:05:15.050 --> 00:05:17.470 
something laughs fast enough because the
Mach<00:05:15.200> enough<00:05:15.500> time<00:05:15.710> so<00:05:16.610> I<00:05:16.640> think<00:05:16.760> that<00:05:17.000> up<00:05:17.300> with

00:05:17.470 --> 00:05:17.480 
Mach enough time so I think that up with

00:05:17.480 --> 00:05:20.050 
Mach enough time so I think that up with
a<00:05:17.510> 7.5<00:05:18.050> second<00:05:18.620> respawn<00:05:19.070> I<00:05:19.100> think<00:05:19.370> ctfo<00:05:19.940> it

00:05:20.050 --> 00:05:20.060 
a 7.5 second respawn I think ctfo it

00:05:20.060 --> 00:05:22.780 
a 7.5 second respawn I think ctfo it
could<00:05:20.240> be<00:05:20.450> an<00:05:20.660> amazing<00:05:21.440> errthang<00:05:22.280> to<00:05:22.460> watch<00:05:22.640> I

00:05:22.780 --> 00:05:22.790 
could be an amazing errthang to watch I

00:05:22.790 --> 00:05:25.060 
could be an amazing errthang to watch I
think<00:05:22.970> but<00:05:23.570> it<00:05:23.690> a<00:05:23.900> lot<00:05:24.140> more<00:05:24.410> saying<00:05:24.770> like<00:05:24.890> or

00:05:25.060 --> 00:05:25.070 
think but it a lot more saying like or

00:05:25.070 --> 00:05:27.430 
think but it a lot more saying like or

00:05:27.430 --> 00:05:27.440 
mod freely played 7.5 respawn but it was

00:05:27.440 --> 00:05:29.530 
mod freely played 7.5 respawn but it was
so<00:05:27.590> slow<00:05:27.800> paced<00:05:28.070> but<00:05:28.700> that's<00:05:29.000> the<00:05:29.150> most<00:05:29.270> flawed

00:05:29.530 --> 00:05:29.540 
so slow paced but that's the most flawed

00:05:29.540 --> 00:05:31.210 
so slow paced but that's the most flawed

00:05:31.210 --> 00:05:31.220 
argument ever honestly look at the pace

00:05:31.220 --> 00:05:33.550

of<00:05:31.430> this<00:05:31.520> game<00:05:31.690> hardpoint<00:05:32.690> needed<00:05:33.020> to<00:05:33.140> respond

00:05:33.550 --> 00:05:33.560 
of this game hardpoint needed to respond

00:05:33.560 --> 00:05:36.909 
of this game hardpoint needed to respond
delay<00:05:33.860> and<00:05:34.600> because<00:05:35.600> of<00:05:35.930> the<00:05:36.350> pace<00:05:36.560> of<00:05:36.740> it<00:05:36.830> I

00:05:36.909 --> 00:05:36.919 
delay and because of the pace of it I

00:05:36.919 --> 00:05:38.380 
delay and because of the pace of it I
think<00:05:36.980> it<00:05:37.310> would<00:05:37.490> be<00:05:37.730> fine<00:05:37.970> it<00:05:38.210> would<00:05:38.300> be

00:05:38.380 --> 00:05:38.390 
think it would be fine it would be

00:05:38.390 --> 00:05:40.870 
think it would be fine it would be
completely<00:05:38.810> fine<00:05:39.080> 7.5<00:05:39.680> respawn<00:05:40.160> what<00:05:40.669> the

00:05:40.870 --> 00:05:40.880 
completely fine 7.5 respawn what the

00:05:40.880 --> 00:05:42.520 
completely fine 7.5 respawn what the
what<00:05:41.210> the<00:05:41.240> movement<00:05:41.540> speed<00:05:41.870> is<00:05:42.080> what<00:05:42.260> we<00:05:42.350> need

00:05:42.520 --> 00:05:42.530 
what the movement speed is what we need

00:05:42.530 --> 00:05:44.800 
what the movement speed is what we need
if<00:05:42.740> anything<00:05:43.280> I'd<00:05:43.430> say<00:05:43.490> 10<00:05:43.940> respawn<00:05:44.600> delay

00:05:44.800 --> 00:05:44.810 
if anything I'd say 10 respawn delay

00:05:44.810 --> 00:05:46.870 
if anything I'd say 10 respawn delay
would<00:05:44.930> be<00:05:45.050> like<00:05:45.260> bear<00:05:45.919> boy<00:05:46.160> some<00:05:46.610> pie<00:05:46.700> five

00:05:46.870 --> 00:05:46.880 
would be like bear boy some pie five

00:05:46.880 --> 00:05:50.320 
would be like bear boy some pie five
point<00:05:47.090> perfect<00:05:47.540> I<00:05:47.750> think<00:05:48.350> that<00:05:49.090> Edward<00:05:50.090> stole

00:05:50.320 --> 00:05:50.330 
point perfect I think that Edward stole

00:05:50.330 --> 00:05:53.170 
point perfect I think that Edward stole

and<00:06:38.300> I<00:06:38.479> think<00:06:38.840> that<00:06:39.020> something<00:06:39.380> needs<00:06:39.530> to<00:06:39.590> be

00:06:39.640 --> 00:06:39.650 
and I think that something needs to be

00:06:39.650 --> 00:06:41.920 
and I think that something needs to be
changed<00:06:39.800> and<00:06:40.100> finally<00:06:40.789> I<00:06:40.819> would<00:06:41.389> like<00:06:41.449> to<00:06:41.600> see

00:06:41.920 --> 00:06:41.930 
changed and finally I would like to see

smgs buffed bit they resent notice that

00:06:45.710 --> 00:06:46.779 
smgs buffed bit they resent notice that
the<00:06:45.770> bow<00:06:45.889> was<00:06:46.069> going<00:06:46.250> to<00:06:46.310> be<00:06:46.400> in<00:06:46.460> there<00:06:46.550> and<00:06:46.759> I

00:06:46.779 --> 00:06:46.789 
the bow was going to be in there and I

00:06:46.789 --> 00:06:47.980 
the bow was going to be in there and I
don't<00:06:46.940> think<00:06:47.300> that<00:06:47.389> was<00:06:47.509> the<00:06:47.539> right<00:06:47.630> thing<00:06:47.900> to

00:06:47.980 --> 00:06:47.990 
don't think that was the right thing to

00:06:47.990 --> 00:06:49.960 
don't think that was the right thing to
do<00:06:48.139> i<00:06:48.169> think<00:06:48.259> the<00:06:48.680> if<00:06:49.130> I<00:06:49.250> was<00:06:49.430> failing<00:06:49.610> the<00:06:49.789> time

00:06:49.960 --> 00:06:49.970 
do i think the if I was failing the time

00:06:49.970 --> 00:06:51.670 
do i think the if I was failing the time
to<00:06:50.150> kill<00:06:50.330> work<00:06:50.509> on<00:06:50.630> it<00:06:50.750> was<00:06:50.870> was<00:06:51.139> great<00:06:51.440> it

00:06:51.670 --> 00:06:51.680 
to kill work on it was was great it

00:06:51.680 --> 00:06:53.439 
to kill work on it was was great it
wasn't<00:06:52.340> too<00:06:52.460> fast<00:06:52.699> it<00:06:52.880> wasn't<00:06:53.090> too<00:06:53.180> slow

00:06:53.439 --> 00:06:53.449 
wasn't too fast it wasn't too slow

00:06:53.449 --> 00:06:55.150 
wasn't too fast it wasn't too slow
although<00:06:54.139> it<00:06:54.229> was<00:06:54.410> better<00:06:54.650> every<00:06:55.069> other

00:06:55.150 --> 00:06:55.160 
although it was better every other

00:06:55.160 --> 00:06:56.770 
although it was better every other
weapon<00:06:55.639> i<00:06:55.699> think<00:06:55.910> i<00:06:56.000> failed<00:06:56.210> a<00:06:56.389> weapon

00:06:56.770 --> 00:06:56.780 
weapon i think i failed a weapon

weapon i think i failed a weapon
honestly<00:06:57.289> just<00:06:57.470> need<00:06:57.650> to<00:06:57.770> be<00:06:57.860> buffed<00:06:58.099> I<00:06:58.370> don't

00:06:58.749 --> 00:06:58.759 
honestly just need to be buffed I don't

00:06:58.759 --> 00:07:00.309 
honestly just need to be buffed I don't
think<00:06:58.819> an<00:06:59.270> elf<00:06:59.479> was<00:06:59.660> needed<00:06:59.930> to<00:06:59.960> think<00:07:00.139> that

00:07:00.309 --> 00:07:00.319 
think an elf was needed to think that

00:07:00.319 --> 00:07:02.350 
think an elf was needed to think that
the<00:07:00.380> time<00:07:00.560> to<00:07:00.740> kill<00:07:00.919> know<00:07:01.130> maybe<00:07:01.940> a<00:07:02.120> bit<00:07:02.330> too

00:07:02.350 --> 00:07:02.360 
the time to kill know maybe a bit too

00:07:02.360 --> 00:07:03.939 
the time to kill know maybe a bit too
long<00:07:02.750> who<00:07:03.110> knows<00:07:03.289> I<00:07:03.500> could<00:07:03.530> be<00:07:03.770> completely

00:07:03.939 --> 00:07:03.949 
long who knows I could be completely

00:07:03.949 --> 00:07:05.830 
long who knows I could be completely
wrong<00:07:04.340> when<00:07:04.580> I'm<00:07:04.669> saying<00:07:04.910> that<00:07:05.060> but<00:07:05.599> I<00:07:05.660> don't

00:07:05.830 --> 00:07:05.840 
wrong when I'm saying that but I don't

00:07:05.840 --> 00:07:07.150
