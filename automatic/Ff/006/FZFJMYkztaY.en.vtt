00:00:08.269 --> 00:00:12.300
 The human cortex on the camel 

00:00:10.889 --> 00:00:16.470
 be comparatively proud 

00:00:12.300 --> 00:00:19.050
 there is so much in there I believe 

00:00:16.470 --> 00:00:19.980
 in the sheep we would have to speculate very much 

00:00:19.050 --> 00:00:21.840
 to get to it 

00:00:19.980 --> 00:00:26.609
 no you no difference 

00:00:21.840 --> 00:00:27.570
 Bill but the slats is still 

00:00:26.609 --> 00:00:30.330
 be present or 

00:00:27.570 --> 00:00:32.250
 just like our lamps are here 

00:00:30.330 --> 00:00:34.020
 they are not necessarily the same size 

00:00:32.250 --> 00:00:35.760
 and just as distinguishable when 

00:00:34.020 --> 00:00:37.980
 humans in humans is natural 

00:00:35.760 --> 00:00:39.660
 very much known whether the sharp on 

00:00:37.980 --> 00:00:41.550
 I can be proud of his cortex 

00:00:39.660 --> 00:00:43.230
 do not judge but I know that in 

00:00:41.550 --> 00:00:45.450
 the cortex in this cerebral cortex 

00:00:43.230 --> 00:00:47.910
 that is the cortex in this cerebral cortex 

00:00:45.450 --> 00:00:49.649
 also structures are with 100 percent 

00:00:47.910 --> 00:00:51.600
 Probability in humans there 

00:00:49.649 --> 00:00:53.670
 are very correct here 

00:00:51.600 --> 00:00:56.610
 humans are also cognitive 

00:00:53.670 --> 00:00:58.219
 things but not all the areas of the 

00:00:56.610 --> 00:01:01.289
 Psychologist always thinks that one with it 

00:00:58.219 --> 00:01:03.270
 But he thinks so in the reason 

00:01:01.289 --> 00:01:05.369
 he took this areale the front here 

00:01:03.270 --> 00:01:09.780
 are associative fields that are whole 

00:01:05.369 --> 00:01:12.180
 important for higher quality services here 

00:01:09.780 --> 00:01:14.070
 until such perhaps the 

00:01:12.180 --> 00:01:16.140
 seat of the personality that at the 

00:01:14.070 --> 00:01:18.090
 sleep there too but back in here 

00:01:16.140 --> 00:01:20.040
 this areal is the oxide a lapp or 

00:01:18.090 --> 00:01:24.000
 behind it main classes with people of the 

00:01:20.040 --> 00:01:26.759
 is about to start here fast-paced and 

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:28.920
 has this areal that's all provided 

00:01:26.759 --> 00:01:31.799
 responsible lies the visual cortex when 

00:01:28.920 --> 00:01:33.960
 you look at the book then then 

00:01:31.799 --> 00:01:36.420
 sees as well that there is here in the 

00:01:33.960 --> 00:01:38.100
 Activities are just as important with sheep 

00:01:36.420 --> 00:01:40.079
 see us in charge of the mouse and there 

00:01:38.100 --> 00:01:42.119
 has synonymous with humans so the 

00:01:40.079 --> 00:01:45.299
 Bauplan always stays the same if you 

00:01:42.119 --> 00:01:46.670
 here with this areal higher performances 

00:01:45.299 --> 00:01:49.799
 spend 

00:01:46.670 --> 00:01:51.899
 then you can ask where sympathy 

00:01:49.799 --> 00:01:55.079
 So if we like the example of 

00:01:51.899 --> 00:01:56.880
 caress or pixel then I excite 

00:01:55.079 --> 00:01:59.219
 accordingly the nerve cells in one 

00:01:56.880 --> 00:02:00.899
 right arm and this projection from 

00:01:59.219 --> 00:02:03.450
 Interestingly enough, the right arm goes up 

00:02:00.899 --> 00:02:06.450
 The left hemisphere is happy and will be around 

00:02:03.450 --> 00:02:10.100
 in this areal shown here as sees 

00:02:06.450 --> 00:02:12.140
 this areal is the sensory cortex 

00:02:10.100 --> 00:02:13.670
 a motor cortex in humans 

00:02:12.140 --> 00:02:17.240
 is that quite clear there is one 

00:02:13.670 --> 00:02:19.970
 relatively clear furrow that furrow am there 

00:02:17.240 --> 00:02:21.530
 i just can human anatomy but 

00:02:19.970 --> 00:02:24.410
 I think this curve runs before here 

00:02:21.530 --> 00:02:27.440
 purely that is the central furrow the 

00:02:24.410 --> 00:02:28.790
 is called visura is central and what I 

00:02:27.440 --> 00:02:30.680
 can clearly say is that here that 

00:02:28.790 --> 00:02:32.330
 The hairstyle lateral is running here long 

00:02:30.680 --> 00:02:33.980
 So a relatively large furrow me 

00:02:32.330 --> 00:02:35.750
 had still make again gone and 

00:02:33.980 --> 00:02:36.110
 the better this time and this rag 

00:02:35.750 --> 00:02:40.130
 here 

00:02:36.110 --> 00:02:42.860
 that is called temporal lapping that is to say 

00:02:40.130 --> 00:02:44.810
 german schlappenlappen because you on 

00:02:42.860 --> 00:02:46.460
 these lamps sleeps therefore comes the 

00:02:44.810 --> 00:02:48.920
 expression flaps at this 

00:02:46.460 --> 00:02:51.170
 There are also flaps of sleep here 

00:02:48.920 --> 00:02:54.050
 Sheep on the sheep is so here 

00:02:51.170 --> 00:02:54.710
 the area it's listening to in the now 

00:02:54.050 --> 00:02:57.020
 it will feel 

00:02:54.710 --> 00:02:58.460
 with the 14 and then up here 

00:02:57.020 --> 00:03:01.160
 frontal lobes to germany's 

00:02:58.460 --> 00:03:03.080
 end lobe is just maybe then 

00:03:01.160 --> 00:03:04.640
 sharply less pronounced than at 

00:03:03.080 --> 00:03:06.350
 people but the basic structures are 

00:03:04.640 --> 00:03:07.550
 because the four lobos we have 

00:03:06.350 --> 00:03:10.670
 then I have not called the 

00:03:07.550 --> 00:03:12.890
 twinned grandparent seven-seater 

00:03:10.670 --> 00:03:14.420
 decides the behind the main flaps of the 

00:03:12.890 --> 00:03:17.270
 temporal lobes and the frontal or 

00:03:14.420 --> 00:03:19.280
 annoying these all there when sharp like 

00:03:17.270 --> 00:03:20.330
 no difference in humans 

00:03:19.280 --> 00:03:22.910
 I know she is sheep 

00:03:20.330 --> 00:03:25.100
 Faces can hold 50 others 

00:03:22.910 --> 00:03:25.990
 even sheep on ten people over 

00:03:25.100 --> 00:03:29.990
 years away 

00:03:25.990 --> 00:03:34.670
 for us it is bare in the temporal lobe 

00:03:29.990 --> 00:03:36.650
 for a tree is probably that is for 

00:03:34.670 --> 00:03:40.070
 she has a sharp face in front of the face 

00:03:36.650 --> 00:03:41.660
 It is even possible to go to sheep 

00:03:40.070 --> 00:03:43.160
 is really one of the few now 

00:03:41.660 --> 00:03:44.660
 Things that are well studied while sleeping 

00:03:43.160 --> 00:03:47.090
 It has been a group from Cambridge 

00:03:44.660 --> 00:03:49.190
 In England, that's really a lot 

00:03:47.090 --> 00:03:51.290
 Schaaf works and she has just that 

00:03:49.190 --> 00:03:53.180
 Trying was very spectacular 

00:03:51.290 --> 00:03:55.580
 so that you show sharp faces 

00:03:53.180 --> 00:03:57.260
 could from sheep and these sheep 

00:03:55.580 --> 00:03:58.850
 were recognized again after two years 

00:03:57.260 --> 00:04:00.560
 and the nerve cells that this 

00:03:58.850 --> 00:04:02.060
 neural correlates have to be 

00:04:00.560 --> 00:04:03.380
 that could be derived 

00:04:02.060 --> 00:04:04.850
 Interestingly, he is in the right area 

00:04:03.380 --> 00:04:05.960
 I can not say right now but where 

00:04:04.850 --> 00:04:07.910
 they would have to be here this winter 

00:04:05.960 --> 00:04:09.800
 temporal lobe just below the nikkei 

00:04:07.910 --> 00:04:12.569
 would have to be here in this areal about 

00:04:09.800 --> 00:04:17.940
 lie at the cortex gibson old 

00:04:12.569 --> 00:04:19.680
 and a young yes neokortex the 

00:04:17.940 --> 00:04:21.810
 is relatively large with us people 

00:04:19.680 --> 00:04:24.210
 pano cortex the old one is not with us 

00:04:21.810 --> 00:04:25.650
 okay, if I'll see you then 

00:04:24.210 --> 00:04:27.690
 maybe even correct it 

00:04:25.650 --> 00:04:29.070
 gives the neocortex to the new cortex 

00:04:27.690 --> 00:04:31.349
 new round that 's what we are here 

00:04:29.070 --> 00:04:33.509
 see in people almost only see and 

00:04:31.349 --> 00:04:36.150
 then there is the other cortex of the neo 

00:04:33.509 --> 00:04:38.310
 Free on iso context evenly 

00:04:36.150 --> 00:04:40.110
 iso when he is the same and then he is 

00:04:38.310 --> 00:04:42.120
 other the alu from the left and the exists 

00:04:40.110 --> 00:04:45.330
 two differences make two differences 

00:04:42.120 --> 00:04:47.699
 of the palÃ©o cortex and architects like the 

00:04:45.330 --> 00:04:49.590
 palaeontologist what everything examined and 

00:04:47.699 --> 00:04:51.539
 the archaeologist they are the two old ones 

00:04:49.590 --> 00:04:54.150
 ariane ironically, is the architect 

00:04:51.539 --> 00:04:56.009
 even older and japan japan is the one 

00:04:54.150 --> 00:04:57.539
 we now have 8 in the sheep 

00:04:56.009 --> 00:04:59.190
 First, sometimes the neocortex here 

00:04:57.539 --> 00:05:01.110
 not to see but have to 

00:04:59.190 --> 00:05:02.370
 turn around and what you can do down here now 

00:05:01.110 --> 00:05:04.979
 can recognize on both sides 

00:05:02.370 --> 00:05:06.599
 of course here on one side and 

00:05:04.979 --> 00:05:08.910
 here on the other side one 

00:05:06.599 --> 00:05:10.470
 hook-shaped structure that is 

00:05:08.910 --> 00:05:12.900
 Latin and cost are there 

00:05:10.470 --> 00:05:15.240
 humans too that's an old cortex 

00:05:12.900 --> 00:05:17.639
 and what is he important for smelling 

00:05:15.240 --> 00:05:18.930
 there is the sleeping pot you can see 

00:05:17.639 --> 00:05:21.810
 that is a very big structure 

00:05:18.930 --> 00:05:22.259
 how bigger than inflation than when 

00:05:21.810 --> 00:05:23.729
 People 

00:05:22.259 --> 00:05:26.130
 which one does not see so far of course 

00:05:23.729 --> 00:05:27.570
 the corpus callosum that the two 

00:05:26.130 --> 00:05:29.460
 hemispheres interconnects that 

00:05:27.570 --> 00:05:30.780
 she does not take care of that 

00:05:29.460 --> 00:05:32.580
 you have to go here at the middle line 

00:05:30.780 --> 00:05:34.050
 between the two hemispheres themselves 

00:05:32.580 --> 00:05:36.330
 freely prepare the whole thing 

00:05:34.050 --> 00:05:38.159
 reasonably deep rheinweiler at 

00:05:36.330 --> 00:05:41.130
 sleep centimeters and then you see 

00:05:38.159 --> 00:05:43.289
 this wise structured the connects 

00:05:41.130 --> 00:05:44.820
 Now just nerve cells with the of the 

00:05:43.289 --> 00:05:45.389
 right half with the left and also 

00:05:44.820 --> 00:05:47.520
 vice versa 

00:05:45.389 --> 00:05:50.099
 You can see it is about three sheep 

00:05:47.520 --> 00:05:51.900
 but not for centimeters 

00:05:50.099 --> 00:05:52.520
 whole brain here in front there is one 

00:05:51.900 --> 00:05:55.169
 Area 

00:05:52.520 --> 00:05:57.240
 maybe I can show it this way 

00:05:55.169 --> 00:05:59.370
 the area that sits in front of it is 

00:05:57.240 --> 00:06:00.840
 just free anyway if this too 

00:05:59.370 --> 00:06:02.370
 nerve cells connected to each other 

00:06:00.840 --> 00:06:04.440
 is called the corpus callosum goes here 

00:06:02.370 --> 00:06:06.150
 over it over the 13 secures itself 

00:06:04.440 --> 00:06:07.710
 but afterwards to the front as well as to 

00:06:06.150 --> 00:06:11.580
 on the back and supplies it all 

00:06:07.710 --> 00:06:13.949
 real- and they are actions of contra 

00:06:11.580 --> 00:06:16.740
 lateral yes these are all axone so 

00:06:13.949 --> 00:06:18.780
 nerve fibers from many millions 

00:06:16.740 --> 00:06:22.039
 nerve cells both from the right to 

00:06:18.780 --> 00:06:22.039
 go right to the left
