when<00:00:27.539> it<00:00:27.660> relax<00:00:27.960> the<00:00:28.109> gastrin<00:00:28.439> amias<00:00:28.800> it's

00:00:29.269 --> 00:00:29.279 
when it relax the gastrin amias it's

00:00:29.279 --> 00:00:31.669 
when it relax the gastrin amias it's
just<00:00:29.490> the<00:00:29.609> soleus<00:00:30.060> that's<00:00:30.449> blocking<00:00:31.289> movement

00:00:31.669 --> 00:00:31.679 
just the soleus that's blocking movement

00:00:31.679 --> 00:00:33.590 
just the soleus that's blocking movement
but<00:00:31.769> down<00:00:31.980> here<00:00:32.279> it's<00:00:32.309> the<00:00:32.759> gastrin<00:00:33.090> amias<00:00:33.420> and

on the other hand when I put the leg in
the<00:00:42.420> same<00:00:42.690> position<00:00:43.290> this<00:00:44.010> way<00:00:44.219> as<00:00:44.610> when<00:00:45.600> I<00:00:45.629> was

00:00:45.799 --> 00:00:45.809 
the same position this way as when I was

the same position this way as when I was
standing<00:00:46.200> straight<00:00:46.789> guess<00:00:47.789> what<00:00:48.289> there's

00:00:49.279 --> 00:00:49.289 
standing straight guess what there's

00:00:49.289 --> 00:00:52.189 
standing straight guess what there's
less<00:00:49.530> movement<00:00:49.860> at<00:00:50.070> the<00:00:50.100> ankle<00:00:50.750> when<00:00:51.750> my<00:00:51.930> hip

00:00:52.189 --> 00:00:52.199 
less movement at the ankle when my hip

00:00:52.199 --> 00:00:56.350 
less movement at the ankle when my hip
is<00:00:52.440> flexed<00:00:52.890> to<00:00:53.129> ninety<00:00:53.219> degrees<00:00:55.160> that

00:00:56.350 --> 00:00:56.360 
is flexed to ninety degrees that

00:00:56.360 --> 00:00:59.090 
is flexed to ninety degrees that
topographically<00:00:57.360> we<00:00:58.050> cannot<00:00:58.410> understand<00:00:58.980> how

00:00:59.090 --> 00:00:59.100 
topographically we cannot understand how

topographically we cannot understand how
the<00:00:59.219> spine<00:00:59.670> and<00:00:59.699> the<00:01:00.000> pelvis<00:01:00.390> functions

00:01:01.150 --> 00:01:01.160 
the spine and the pelvis functions

00:01:01.160 --> 00:01:03.619 
the spine and the pelvis functions
because<00:01:02.160> we<00:01:02.670> need<00:01:02.850> a<00:01:02.879> functional<00:01:03.449> approach

00:01:03.619 --> 00:01:03.629 
because we need a functional approach

00:01:03.629 --> 00:01:06.350 
because we need a functional approach
and<00:01:04.500> that<00:01:04.530> functional<00:01:05.519> approach<00:01:05.640> actually

00:01:06.350 --> 00:01:06.360 
and that functional approach actually

00:01:06.360 --> 00:01:08.620 
and that functional approach actually
means<00:01:07.080> that<00:01:07.530> our<00:01:07.770> classification

00:01:08.620 --> 00:01:08.630 
means that our classification

00:01:08.630 --> 00:01:11.420 
means that our classification

back actually and here's the big word
for<00:01:15.900> the<00:01:16.320> schools<00:01:16.619> are<00:01:16.939> connected<00:01:17.939> so<00:01:18.600> here

00:01:18.859 --> 00:01:18.869 
for the schools are connected so here

00:01:18.869 --> 00:01:20.690 
for the schools are connected so here
you<00:01:18.990> say<00:01:19.259> from<00:01:19.590> right<00:01:19.799> heel<00:01:20.009> strike<00:01:20.340> to<00:01:20.520> right

00:01:20.690 --> 00:01:20.700 
you say from right heel strike to right

00:01:20.700 --> 00:01:22.700 
you say from right heel strike to right
he'll<00:01:20.939> strike<00:01:21.210> transversus<00:01:21.930> never<00:01:22.170> turns<00:01:22.439> off

00:01:22.700 --> 00:01:22.710 
he'll strike transversus never turns off

00:01:22.710 --> 00:01:25.160 
he'll strike transversus never turns off
its<00:01:23.310> not<00:01:23.549> just<00:01:23.610> a<00:01:24.030> simple<00:01:24.360> mechanism<00:01:24.990> of

00:01:25.160 --> 00:01:25.170 
its not just a simple mechanism of

00:01:25.170 --> 00:01:27.160 
its not just a simple mechanism of
stiffen<00:01:25.770> your<00:01:25.799> spine<00:01:26.159> and<00:01:26.369> keep<00:01:26.580> it<00:01:26.729> upright

00:01:27.160 --> 00:01:27.170 
stiffen your spine and keep it upright

00:01:27.170 --> 00:01:31.039 
stiffen your spine and keep it upright
function<00:01:28.170> involves<00:01:29.100> dynamic<00:01:29.880> control<00:01:30.630> and

00:02:11.850 --> 00:02:14.120 
conclusion from this study is your
tendons<00:02:12.450> develop<00:02:13.140> while<00:02:13.380> you're<00:02:13.590> growing

00:02:14.120 --> 00:02:14.130 
tendons develop while you're growing

00:02:14.130 --> 00:02:17.060 
tendons develop while you're growing
after<00:02:15.000> you're<00:02:15.180> 18<00:02:15.780> there<00:02:16.110> is<00:02:16.200> not<00:02:16.500> much<00:02:16.740> of<00:02:16.980> a

00:02:17.060 --> 00:02:17.070 
after you're 18 there is not much of a

00:02:17.070 --> 00:02:19.460 
after you're 18 there is not much of a
turnover<00:02:17.610> of<00:02:17.640> your<00:02:17.910> tendon<00:02:18.300> unless<00:02:19.020> you<00:02:19.230> have

00:02:19.460 --> 00:02:19.470 
turnover of your tendon unless you have

00:02:19.470 --> 00:02:22.520 
turnover of your tendon unless you have
an<00:02:19.710> injury<00:02:20.190> so<00:02:20.940> you<00:02:21.000> always<00:02:21.300> have<00:02:21.810> fibers

00:02:22.520 --> 00:02:22.530 
an injury so you always have fibers

00:02:22.530 --> 00:02:25.640 
an injury so you always have fibers
around<00:02:23.100> the<00:02:23.910> region<00:02:24.060> here<00:02:24.600> here<00:02:25.410> are<00:02:25.500> some

00:02:25.640 --> 00:02:25.650 
around the region here here are some

00:02:25.650 --> 00:02:27.320 
around the region here here are some
fibers<00:02:26.100> here<00:02:26.310> are<00:02:26.400> five<00:02:26.670> hours<00:02:26.850> and<00:02:27.030> then<00:02:27.180> you

00:02:27.320 --> 00:02:27.330 
fibers here are five hours and then you

00:02:27.330 --> 00:02:29.540 
fibers here are five hours and then you
have<00:02:27.540> to<00:02:27.720> decide<00:02:28.140> as<00:02:28.440> another<00:02:28.710> pedic<00:02:29.100> surgeon

00:02:29.540 --> 00:02:29.550 
have to decide as another pedic surgeon

it's such a nonspecific treatment that

it's such a nonspecific treatment that
