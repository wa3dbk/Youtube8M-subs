00:00:08.889 --> 00:00:11.589
 Syria with Sims one of the most popular in 

00:00:11.589 --> 00:00:14.139
 the world they regularly go official 

00:00:14.139 --> 00:00:16.740
 addition fans want mods a 

00:00:16.740 --> 00:00:19.169
 millions of fans run daily 

00:00:19.169 --> 00:00:19.980
 the game 

00:00:19.980 --> 00:00:22.510
 when the second part of the body is a huge step 

00:00:22.510 --> 00:00:24.910
 forward and put forward a life simulation on 

00:00:24.910 --> 00:00:26.109
 new level 

00:00:26.109 --> 00:00:28.280
 but today is very cruel rub 

00:00:28.280 --> 00:00:30.940
 not just a step forward agency jump with 

00:00:30.940 --> 00:00:31.729
 run 

00:00:31.729 --> 00:00:34.729
 Meet gaysin articles 

00:00:36.690 --> 00:00:39.090
 everybody probably knows where sims starts 

00:00:39.090 --> 00:00:41.650
 of course with character generation 

00:00:41.650 --> 00:00:44.060
 many lovers of the series were looking forward to 

00:00:44.060 --> 00:00:45.620
 what will come up this time 

00:00:45.620 --> 00:00:47.800
 developers can we do 

00:00:47.800 --> 00:00:49.750
 photographically exact copies of yourself 

00:00:49.750 --> 00:00:51.990
 loved ones or is limited to the level 

00:00:51.990 --> 00:00:54.060
 the second part it turned out that at least 

00:00:54.060 --> 00:00:56.590
 the graphics became good but the sliders are a bit 

00:00:56.590 --> 00:00:58.790
 on the base las truth even the rest 

00:00:58.790 --> 00:01:01.790
 enough with a vengeance 

00:01:07.580 --> 00:01:10.020
 but more importantly now we can personally 

00:01:10.020 --> 00:01:11.770
 set the tone for any girl 

00:01:11.770 --> 00:01:14.149
 didn't like the shade of this sundress 

00:01:14.149 --> 00:01:16.039
 problem can repaint and make 

00:01:16.039 --> 00:01:17.500
 even better than it was 

00:01:17.500 --> 00:01:20.060
 we are frankly sorry for girls how much they 

00:01:20.060 --> 00:01:22.220
 take time to pick one 

00:01:22.220 --> 00:01:24.220
 worthy outfit it's all colors 

00:01:24.220 --> 00:01:26.290
 try with different hairstyles and 

00:01:26.290 --> 00:01:29.290
 make up 

00:01:42.510 --> 00:01:44.680
 after being finished 

00:01:44.680 --> 00:01:47.000
 we are once again faced with a novelty in the world 

00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:48.090
 pessimists 

00:01:48.090 --> 00:01:50.760
 zodiac signs disappeared and came to their place 

00:01:50.760 --> 00:01:53.210
 character traits they now form 

00:01:53.210 --> 00:01:54.560
 personality 

00:01:54.560 --> 00:01:56.680
 total 10 5 and chili where we put 

00:01:56.680 --> 00:01:58.420
 features we need 

00:01:58.420 --> 00:01:59.530
 character 

00:01:59.530 --> 00:02:01.210
 if we want to climb quickly 

00:02:01.210 --> 00:02:03.210
 career and getting a lot of money 

00:02:03.210 --> 00:02:06.400
 and fame then we take such traits as a workaholic 3 

00:02:06.400 --> 00:02:07.690
 article units 

00:02:07.690 --> 00:02:09.470
 everything will depend on this choice 

00:02:09.470 --> 00:02:12.140
 further games as soon as the character 

00:02:12.140 --> 00:02:13.640
 created we go to 

00:02:13.640 --> 00:02:14.999
 great life 

00:02:14.999 --> 00:02:17.029
 the new city may be it is not so 

00:02:17.029 --> 00:02:19.369
 big as in the previous part but 

00:02:19.369 --> 00:02:21.029
 but we can look into any 

00:02:21.029 --> 00:02:21.929
 corner 

00:02:21.929 --> 00:02:23.569
 no more download screens 

00:02:23.569 --> 00:02:25.889
 artificial limiters 

00:02:25.889 --> 00:02:28.489
 not all work at all 

00:02:28.489 --> 00:02:30.900
 Here runs to the neighbors and now just walk 

00:02:30.900 --> 00:02:31.749
 in the park 

00:02:31.749 --> 00:02:34.159
 the city has become a real play for us now 

00:02:34.159 --> 00:02:35.469
 much more convenient 

00:02:35.469 --> 00:02:37.699
 the camera comes off the hero we choose 

00:02:37.699 --> 00:02:39.619
 place where we want to go and again and 

00:02:39.619 --> 00:02:41.959
 down Kasims do not even believe that 

00:02:41.959 --> 00:02:43.119
 we had to call before 

00:02:43.119 --> 00:02:45.539
 Taxi wait then call again to 

00:02:45.539 --> 00:02:46.839
 we were taken 

00:02:46.839 --> 00:02:49.369
 Now everyone who is very simple especially if 

00:02:49.369 --> 00:02:50.629
 we have our own 

00:02:50.629 --> 00:02:52.950
 car bank bad one 

00:02:52.950 --> 00:02:55.069
 far from all actions are possible 

00:02:55.069 --> 00:02:55.880
 watch 

00:02:55.880 --> 00:02:58.010
 if we move along the museum with 

00:02:58.010 --> 00:03:00.230
 character well that's how it works or 

00:03:00.230 --> 00:03:02.099
 sit movie unknown 

00:03:02.099 --> 00:03:04.329
 random events on the map which is strongly 

00:03:04.329 --> 00:03:06.859
 diversifies the gameplay for us 

00:03:06.859 --> 00:03:09.340
 closed sorry of course because we would for example 

00:03:09.340 --> 00:03:10.689
 I would like to participate in 

00:03:10.689 --> 00:03:11.440
 Olympiad 

00:03:11.440 --> 00:03:12.930
 or help the heroes to collect 

00:03:12.930 --> 00:03:15.930
 crumbled in puzzle store 

00:03:17.089 --> 00:03:19.179
 constantly travel to the city now just 

00:03:19.179 --> 00:03:21.609
 need to pay attention to new 

00:03:21.609 --> 00:03:23.569
 a window at the bottom of the screen about this indicator 

00:03:23.569 --> 00:03:26.399
 sentiment which is partly replaced 

00:03:26.399 --> 00:03:27.939
 fears and desires 

00:03:27.939 --> 00:03:29.979
 general system of courting the village 

00:03:29.979 --> 00:03:32.309
 it has become much easier here for example if 

00:03:32.309 --> 00:03:34.699
 the character is totally experts on 10 

00:03:34.699 --> 00:03:36.989
 hours it will cheer him up 

00:03:36.989 --> 00:03:39.730
 the museum will inspire the hero salon costs well 

00:03:39.730 --> 00:03:41.549
 good manicure will give a long time 

00:03:41.549 --> 00:03:44.040
 Peopleâ€™s confidence is negative 

00:03:44.040 --> 00:03:46.359
 influences strong hunger will not allow work 

00:03:46.359 --> 00:03:49.019
 and learn street rudeness from sadness 

00:03:49.019 --> 00:03:51.150
 the response will be annoying 

00:03:51.150 --> 00:03:53.379
 all sorts of modifiers 

00:03:53.379 --> 00:03:56.230
 probably about a hundred for each situation and 

00:03:56.230 --> 00:03:58.799
 depending on the type of personality characters 

00:03:58.799 --> 00:04:00.509
 become more alive 

00:04:00.509 --> 00:04:02.649
 The interaction could also come to the new 

00:04:02.649 --> 00:04:04.679
 character trait level now 

00:04:04.679 --> 00:04:07.409
 Chubby girl can affect communication 

00:04:07.409 --> 00:04:09.569
 talk a lot about love flirt 

00:04:09.569 --> 00:04:11.059
 only if he prefers 

00:04:11.059 --> 00:04:12.309
 asking about work 

00:04:12.309 --> 00:04:14.229
 all telling what he did today in 

00:04:14.229 --> 00:04:14.979
 the office 

00:04:14.979 --> 00:04:17.349
 if the interests of the characters do not match 

00:04:17.349 --> 00:04:18.819
 sure to stay 

00:04:18.819 --> 00:04:20.299
 it looks very simple 

00:04:20.299 --> 00:04:22.300
 Yes, and in fact there is nothing difficult 

00:04:22.300 --> 00:04:24.199
 Gusinsky hail directed not to 

00:04:24.199 --> 00:04:26.590
 the result of the third part has become 

00:04:26.590 --> 00:04:28.900
 it is more comfortable to live and residents 

00:04:28.900 --> 00:04:31.599
 chat with friends ride with them akims 

00:04:31.599 --> 00:04:33.590
 enter the park have fun 

00:04:33.590 --> 00:04:35.810
 you can work at home and you can sit in 

00:04:35.810 --> 00:04:36.469
 the office 

00:04:36.469 --> 00:04:38.249
 you can start your own business and buy 

00:04:38.249 --> 00:04:39.529
 for example restaurants 

00:04:39.529 --> 00:04:41.469
 the characters confess each other love 

00:04:41.469 --> 00:04:44.779
 getting married having sex from the streets 

00:04:44.779 --> 00:04:46.979
 some are constantly thinking about work ready 

00:04:46.979 --> 00:04:48.809
 several days to carry out orders 

00:04:48.809 --> 00:04:51.289
 bosses and others busy with children 

00:04:51.289 --> 00:04:53.740
 the third is three more adventure races 

00:04:53.740 --> 00:04:54.999
 tons 

00:04:54.999 --> 00:04:57.699
 pessimists are a very typical game 

00:04:57.699 --> 00:05:00.300
 talk about all its aspects is impossible 

00:05:00.300 --> 00:05:02.789
 we recommend you just play it 

00:05:02.789 --> 00:05:04.449
 unique project that is capable 

00:05:04.449 --> 00:05:06.270
 absolutely everyone will like
