somewhere I think it's around here there
it<00:02:17.230> is

00:02:17.520 --> 00:02:17.530 
it is

00:02:17.530 --> 00:02:19.500 
it is
there<00:02:17.980> is<00:02:18.070> something<00:02:18.430> glimmering<00:02:18.940> faintly<00:02:19.330> in

00:02:19.500 --> 00:02:19.510 
there is something glimmering faintly in

00:02:19.510 --> 00:02:20.730 
there is something glimmering faintly in
the<00:02:19.600> water<00:02:19.840> will<00:02:20.050> you<00:02:20.140> pick<00:02:20.320> it<00:02:20.440> up

00:02:20.730 --> 00:02:20.740 
the water will you pick it up

00:02:20.740 --> 00:02:27.780 
the water will you pick it up
that's<00:02:21.040> a<00:02:21.220> scanner<00:02:25.800> all<00:02:26.800> right<00:02:27.100> so<00:02:27.280> we<00:02:27.430> got<00:02:27.640> the

00:02:27.780 --> 00:02:27.790 
that's a scanner all right so we got the

00:02:27.790 --> 00:02:29.910 
that's a scanner all right so we got the
scanner<00:02:28.120> and<00:02:28.390> I<00:02:28.840> think<00:02:29.170> you<00:02:29.260> have<00:02:29.410> to<00:02:29.530> give<00:02:29.710> the

00:02:29.910 --> 00:02:29.920 
scanner and I think you have to give the

00:02:29.920 --> 00:02:40.970 
scanner and I think you have to give the
scanner<00:02:30.280> to<00:02:30.660> captain<00:02:31.660> stern<00:02:33.090> so<00:02:34.090> key<00:02:34.270> item

00:02:57.540 --> 00:02:57.550 
we can turn them in this scanner that we

00:02:57.550 --> 00:03:03.240 
we can turn them in this scanner that we
just<00:02:57.760> found<00:03:01.140> so<00:03:02.140> let's<00:03:02.380> get<00:03:02.530> out<00:03:02.709> of<00:03:02.740> here<00:03:02.860> and

00:05:33.070 --> 00:05:35.640 
not so I don't know what the Bell is for
I<00:05:33.100> guess<00:05:33.220> it's<00:05:33.610> for<00:05:33.880> Pablo<00:05:34.420> or<00:05:34.780> lugia<00:05:35.140> so<00:05:35.440> each

00:05:35.640 --> 00:05:35.650 
I guess it's for Pablo or lugia so each

00:05:35.650 --> 00:05:37.500 
I guess it's for Pablo or lugia so each
game<00:05:36.070> will<00:05:36.100> have<00:05:36.490> a<00:05:36.550> different<00:05:37.060> version<00:05:37.300> of

game will have a different version of
the<00:05:38.170> Bell

00:05:38.700 --> 00:05:38.710 
the Bell

00:05:38.710 --> 00:05:41.730 
the Bell
