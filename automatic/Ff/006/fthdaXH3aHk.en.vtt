 "Relieving muscle fatigue with the help of citrus" 

00:00:06.620 --> 00:00:09.918
 Lactic acid supplying the sour taste of yogurt is the same substance 

00:00:09.918 --> 00:00:12.636
 as lactic acid forming in the muscles 

00:00:12.636 --> 00:00:14.774
 as a result of a demanding exercise. 

00:00:14.774 --> 00:00:16.861
 In the case of milk, bacteria ferment milk sugar, 

00:00:16.861 --> 00:00:18.221
 to create energy for themselves 

00:00:18.221 --> 00:00:19.987
 in our body, the muscles ferment sugar from our diet, 

00:00:19.987 --> 00:00:22.637
 to create energy for their downloads. 

00:00:22.637 --> 00:00:25.868
 For example, when we sprint, lactic acid is in our muscles 

00:00:25.868 --> 00:00:28.212
 it accumulates faster than we can remove it. 

00:00:28.212 --> 00:00:31.270
 That is why we can feel burning feelings in the muscles for some time 

00:00:31.270 --> 00:00:32.884
 that makes us stop. 

00:00:32.884 --> 00:00:35.631
 If we train regularly, we can increase the number 

00:00:35.631 --> 00:00:37.612
 blood vessels in our muscles 

00:00:37.612 --> 00:00:39.703
 and remove lactate faster. 

00:00:39.703 --> 00:00:43.157
 For example, if you select overweight women who live a sedentary life 

00:00:43.157 --> 00:00:45.894
 and prescribe them an aerobic exercise plan 

00:00:45.894 --> 00:00:46.999
 consisting of running and walking, 

00:00:46.999 --> 00:00:49.183
 after three months of their lactate level 

00:00:49.183 --> 00:00:52.220
 they fall by 17% during exercise. 

00:00:52.220 --> 00:00:53.890
 Women following the same exercise plan 

00:00:53.890 --> 00:00:56.619
 which simultaneously drink two cups of orange juice a day 

00:00:56.619 --> 00:00:59.321
 decreased their lactate levels by 27%. 

00:00:59.321 --> 00:01:01.187
 The exercise plan was the same, 

00:01:01.187 --> 00:01:04.148
 but the citrus group has seen a significant decline 

00:01:04.148 --> 00:01:06.532
 blood lactate concentration. 

00:01:06.532 --> 00:01:09.052
 This means improving physical performance 

00:01:09.052 --> 00:01:11.455
 and less muscle fatigue. 

00:01:11.455 --> 00:01:14.556
 I do not recommend drinking fruit juice, 

00:01:14.556 --> 00:01:16.730
 because you will lose great fiber, 

00:01:16.730 --> 00:01:20.089
 which slows down the absorption of fruit sugar into the blood. 

00:01:20.089 --> 00:01:22.481
 Here's a sharp rise in blood sugar 

00:01:22.481 --> 00:01:24.956
 that will happen after drinking Coca Cola. 

00:01:24.956 --> 00:01:27.185
 Now we compare it with the increase after drinking orange juice. 

00:01:27.185 --> 00:01:29.286
 No difference. 

00:01:29.286 --> 00:01:31.257
 What if you eat the same amount of sugar 

00:01:31.257 --> 00:01:33.903
 in the form of sliced â€‹â€‹orange? 

00:01:33.903 --> 00:01:35.222
 Significantly lower growth. 

00:01:35.222 --> 00:01:39.275
 So the whole fruit is almost always better than fruit juice. 

00:01:39.275 --> 00:01:42.430
 Of course, I don't mean to say that orange juice isn't better than bicycles. 

00:01:42.431 --> 00:01:46.080
 Still contains citrus phytonutrients, such as hesperidin, 

00:01:46.084 --> 00:01:49.250
 which may be the reason why triglyceride levels have not increased for women 

00:01:49.250 --> 00:01:52.660
 although they were drinking two cups of fruit juice every day. 

00:01:52.663 --> 00:01:57.130
 Hesperidin can even help reduce fat absorption, 

00:01:57.130 --> 00:02:00.700
 But once you cross the three-cup juice limit 

00:02:00.702 --> 00:02:06.360
 daily, your triglyceride levels may start to increase.
