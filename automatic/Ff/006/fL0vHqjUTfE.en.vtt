have problems with the CDs as far as the

00:01:22.020 --> 00:01:23.450 
have problems with the CDs as far as the

recording process not completing all the
way<00:01:23.640> I<00:01:23.820> do<00:01:23.909> suggest<00:01:24.210> turning<00:01:24.689> down<00:01:24.780> the

00:01:24.890 --> 00:01:24.900 
way I do suggest turning down the

00:01:24.900 --> 00:01:28.910 
way I do suggest turning down the
recording<00:01:25.259> speed<00:01:25.500> maybe<00:01:26.460> to<00:01:26.790> a<00:01:26.820> 24<00:01:27.600> 4<00:01:28.530> or<00:01:28.680> 16

00:01:28.910 --> 00:01:28.920 
recording speed maybe to a 24 4 or 16

00:01:28.920 --> 00:01:31.760 
recording speed maybe to a 24 4 or 16
then<00:01:29.520> it<00:01:29.670> next<00:01:30.350> this<00:01:31.350> is<00:01:31.470> where<00:01:31.590> you<00:01:31.650> decide

00:01:31.760 --> 00:01:31.770 
then it next this is where you decide

00:01:31.770 --> 00:01:33.140 
then it next this is where you decide
whether<00:01:32.310> or<00:01:32.369> not<00:01:32.460> you'd<00:01:32.610> like<00:01:32.729> to<00:01:32.820> play<00:01:33.000> your
