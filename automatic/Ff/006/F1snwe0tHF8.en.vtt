00:00:01.490 --> 00:00:05.850
 hi i'm duke and today i want to talk to you 

00:00:03.810 --> 00:00:07.890
 di the rat inc 

00:00:05.850 --> 00:00:09.630
 a game developed by two Italians who 

00:00:07.890 --> 00:00:12.210
 they decided well to go up in 

00:00:09.630 --> 00:00:13.740
 sweden to open their studio of 

00:00:12.210 --> 00:00:16.800
 called video game development 

00:00:13.740 --> 00:00:18.600
 bumblebee studios this game in between 

00:00:16.800 --> 00:00:20.310
 the other is available on all 

00:00:18.600 --> 00:00:22.699
 mobile devices 

00:00:20.310 --> 00:00:25.650
 but really all iphone ipad android 

00:00:22.699 --> 00:00:27.210
 windows phone and is also available on 

00:00:25.650 --> 00:00:29.760
 kindle fire that an ebook reader 

00:00:27.210 --> 00:00:31.470
 so from this point of view you have 

00:00:29.760 --> 00:00:33.239
 spoiled for choice 

00:00:31.470 --> 00:00:35.370
 there is no mobile device that cannot 

00:00:33.239 --> 00:00:37.380
 support this game but come on 

00:00:35.370 --> 00:00:39.540
 immediately to see what it is 

00:00:37.380 --> 00:00:41.399
 because behind this cardboard look 

00:00:39.540 --> 00:00:43.290
 animated if there was a game that it really is 

00:00:41.399 --> 00:00:46.230
 able to test yours 

00:00:43.290 --> 00:00:48.960
 multitasking skills and also i 

00:00:46.230 --> 00:00:51.239
 your reflections in fact what 

00:00:48.960 --> 00:00:53.579
 we have to do is use these 

00:00:51.239 --> 00:00:57.360
 vans that are driven by cats 

00:00:53.579 --> 00:00:59.690
 and send them to counter the invasions of 

00:00:57.360 --> 00:01:01.859
 mice in these town houses 

00:00:59.690 --> 00:01:03.559
 at the beginning it will be very simple not 

00:01:01.859 --> 00:01:05.909
 we'll have to do more than click on 

00:01:03.559 --> 00:01:08.010
 van that we want to use for 

00:01:05.909 --> 00:01:09.510
 click on the house you can click on 

00:01:08.010 --> 00:01:11.549
 second van and send it by 

00:01:09.510 --> 00:01:13.260
 another part and so far of network but 

00:01:11.549 --> 00:01:15.689
 then where is the difficulty not 

00:01:13.260 --> 00:01:18.060
 worry that with the increase of 

00:01:15.689 --> 00:01:20.729
 levels you will come to a speed of 

00:01:18.060 --> 00:01:22.430
 awesome game will increase i 

00:01:20.729 --> 00:01:24.780
 vans that we will have to manage 

00:01:22.430 --> 00:01:26.700
 contemporary invasions will increase 

00:01:24.780 --> 00:01:28.950
 of mice and when we are talking about mice 

00:01:26.700 --> 00:01:30.720
 normal mice are so aggressive that if 

00:01:28.950 --> 00:01:32.880
 we do not rush houses collapse 

00:01:30.720 --> 00:01:34.920
 instead I only tell you this 

00:01:32.880 --> 00:01:36.720
 and if too many houses collapse we have lost 

00:01:34.920 --> 00:01:38.579
 so what we need to do e 

00:01:36.720 --> 00:01:40.799
 send them fast among other things 

00:01:38.579 --> 00:01:42.899
 we must also try to think of 

00:01:40.799 --> 00:01:45.600
 the best route to do 

00:01:42.899 --> 00:01:47.310
 each van because there are gods 

00:01:45.600 --> 00:01:49.439
 power ups along the way of the 

00:01:47.310 --> 00:01:51.570
 upgrades for our vans 

00:01:49.439 --> 00:01:53.579
 which will go faster they will fight in 

00:01:51.570 --> 00:01:55.950
 stronger way and so on 

00:01:53.579 --> 00:01:58.170
 what else to say this game as you remember 

00:01:55.950 --> 00:01:59.790
 for a detail starcraft ii for how much 

00:01:58.170 --> 00:02:01.350
 this comparison may seem absurd 

00:01:59.790 --> 00:02:03.600
 in starcraft ii 

00:02:01.350 --> 00:02:06.149
 there is something called micro management 

00:02:03.600 --> 00:02:08.069
 that is the ability to control all 

00:02:06.149 --> 00:02:10.319
 the units we have available and 

00:02:08.069 --> 00:02:12.550
 sending them at the right time can do is 

00:02:10.319 --> 00:02:15.070
 the right action then 

00:02:12.550 --> 00:02:18.010
 set of different actions for each individual 

00:02:15.070 --> 00:02:20.290
 unity and this is not a thing at all 

00:02:18.010 --> 00:02:21.520
 simple in the more advanced stages of 

00:02:20.290 --> 00:02:24.040
 this game we will have to 

00:02:21.520 --> 00:02:26.590
 send a higher number of 

00:02:24.040 --> 00:02:27.850
 vans and these will have to do the 

00:02:26.590 --> 00:02:29.410
 right way 

00:02:27.850 --> 00:02:31.120
 they will have to go to the right house and 

00:02:29.410 --> 00:02:33.370
 do it at the right time so 

00:02:31.120 --> 00:02:36.430
 being able to switch to taking power ups 

00:02:33.370 --> 00:02:38.140
 which are used to win because without 

00:02:36.430 --> 00:02:40.630
 power ups in the most advanced stages can 

00:02:38.140 --> 00:02:43.360
 become really tough and that's why 

00:02:40.630 --> 00:02:44.830
 reason I had to think again why 

00:02:43.360 --> 00:02:46.750
 at the beginning of the game I thought it was 

00:02:44.830 --> 00:02:48.730
 a very simple game that almost does not 

00:02:46.750 --> 00:02:50.650
 present challenge instead of the end 

00:02:48.730 --> 00:02:53.350
 when started losing from the last 

00:02:50.650 --> 00:02:55.480
 levels I have made precisely due 

00:02:53.350 --> 00:02:57.940
 think again and I started to understand that 

00:02:55.480 --> 00:02:59.740
 need more concentration and served 

00:02:57.940 --> 00:03:01.660
 all in all good players 

00:02:59.740 --> 00:03:03.700
 to get to the bottom 

00:03:01.660 --> 00:03:04.960
 so this is all this era of 

00:03:03.700 --> 00:03:06.910
 I think I hope the video was 

00:03:04.960 --> 00:03:09.750
 interesting see you at the next 

00:03:06.910 --> 00:03:09.750
 hello to all
