is very easy to do because he's got a

00:01:19.470 --> 00:01:25.190 
is very easy to do because he's got a
little<00:01:19.619> scrounge<00:01:23.330> first<00:01:24.330> bin<00:01:24.509> first<00:01:24.840> it's

00:01:25.190 --> 00:01:25.200 
little scrounge first bin first it's

00:01:25.200 --> 00:01:27.950 
little scrounge first bin first it's
quite<00:01:25.799> a<00:01:25.830> nice<00:01:26.040> bright<00:01:26.400> orange<00:01:26.610> color<00:01:27.150> and<00:01:27.840> I

00:01:27.950 --> 00:01:27.960 
quite a nice bright orange color and I

00:01:27.960 --> 00:01:28.990 
quite a nice bright orange color and I
like<00:01:28.080> the<00:01:28.229> chrome<00:01:28.470> wheels<00:01:28.680> on<00:01:28.920> it

00:01:28.990 --> 00:01:29.000 
like the chrome wheels on it

00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:31.160 
like the chrome wheels on it
unfortunately<00:01:30.000> for<00:01:30.570> the<00:01:30.630> super-resistant

00:01:31.160 --> 00:01:31.170 
unfortunately for the super-resistant

00:01:31.170 --> 00:01:32.569 
unfortunately for the super-resistant
model<00:01:31.470> you<00:01:31.619> don't<00:01:31.770> get<00:01:32.009> the<00:01:32.159> chrome<00:01:32.400> wheels

00:01:32.569 --> 00:01:32.579 
model you don't get the chrome wheels

00:01:32.579 --> 00:01:34.880 
model you don't get the chrome wheels
you<00:01:32.759> just<00:01:32.909> get<00:01:33.060> the<00:01:33.119> black<00:01:33.299> wheels<00:01:33.600> but<00:01:34.530> I

00:01:34.880 --> 00:01:34.890 
you just get the black wheels but I

00:01:34.890 --> 00:01:36.920 
you just get the black wheels but I
think<00:01:35.759> it<00:01:35.880> looks<00:01:35.909> bit<00:01:36.240> nicer<00:01:36.450> with<00:01:36.689> the<00:01:36.750> chrome

00:01:36.920 --> 00:01:36.930 
think it looks bit nicer with the chrome

00:01:36.930 --> 00:01:38.420 
think it looks bit nicer with the chrome
ones<00:01:37.140> and<00:01:37.290> I<00:01:37.320> think<00:01:37.470> the<00:01:37.890> blue<00:01:38.070> one<00:01:38.250> should

00:01:38.420 --> 00:01:38.430 
ones and I think the blue one should

00:01:38.430 --> 00:01:40.310 
ones and I think the blue one should
have<00:01:38.490> had<00:01:38.610> the<00:01:39.119> chrome<00:01:39.390> wheels<00:01:39.630> but<00:01:39.960> I'll<00:01:40.140> get

00:01:40.310 --> 00:01:40.320 
have had the chrome wheels but I'll get

00:01:40.320 --> 00:01:42.170

00:01:42.170 --> 00:01:42.180 
onto that when I actually did the blue

00:01:42.180 --> 00:01:44.929 
onto that when I actually did the blue

bit<00:01:48.000> of<00:01:48.030> high<00:01:48.329> detail<00:01:48.840> on<00:01:49.110> your<00:01:49.259> cars<00:01:49.530> I<00:01:49.740> would

00:01:50.120 --> 00:01:50.130 
bit of high detail on your cars I would

00:01:50.130 --> 00:01:52.280 
bit of high detail on your cars I would
suggest<00:01:50.280> that<00:01:50.520> you<00:01:50.610> get<00:01:50.790> this<00:01:50.909> one<00:01:50.970> it's<00:01:51.960> also

00:01:52.280 --> 00:01:52.290 
suggest that you get this one it's also

00:01:52.290 --> 00:01:55.249 
suggest that you get this one it's also
quite<00:01:52.890> good<00:01:53.130> and<00:01:53.340> worth<00:01:54.270> noting<00:01:54.930> that<00:01:55.079> all

00:01:55.249 --> 00:01:55.259 
quite good and worth noting that all

00:01:55.259 --> 00:01:57.649 
quite good and worth noting that all
these<00:01:55.560> bits<00:01:55.829> of<00:01:56.009> glass<00:01:56.189> are<00:01:56.460> individual<00:01:57.420> as

00:01:57.649 --> 00:01:57.659 
these bits of glass are individual as

00:01:57.659 --> 00:01:59.840 
these bits of glass are individual as
well<00:01:58.170> so<00:01:58.500> scale<00:01:58.710> that<00:01:58.799> rates<00:01:58.979> have<00:01:59.130> not<00:01:59.490> gone

00:01:59.840 --> 00:01:59.850 
well so scale that rates have not gone

00:01:59.850 --> 00:02:03.200 
well so scale that rates have not gone
and<00:02:00.210> made<00:02:01.020> one<00:02:01.290> piece<00:02:01.590> and<00:02:02.009> try<00:02:02.790> to<00:02:02.850> make<00:02:03.090> it

00:02:03.200 --> 00:02:03.210 
and made one piece and try to make it

00:02:03.210 --> 00:02:06.109 
and made one piece and try to make it
look<00:02:03.329> like<00:02:03.479> they've<00:02:03.810> made<00:02:04.799> it<00:02:04.950> mid<00:02:05.700> holes<00:02:05.939> it

00:02:06.109 --> 00:02:06.119 
look like they've made it mid holes it

00:02:06.119 --> 00:02:07.940 
look like they've made it mid holes it
they've<00:02:06.360> actually<00:02:06.600> done<00:02:06.990> three<00:02:07.500> separate

00:02:07.940 --> 00:02:07.950 
they've actually done three separate

00:02:07.950 --> 00:02:10.990 
they've actually done three separate
pieces<00:02:08.190> and<00:02:09.289> I

00:02:10.990 --> 00:02:11.000 
pieces and I

00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:14.320 
pieces and I
say<00:02:11.210> it<00:02:11.600> looks<00:02:12.020> fantastic<00:02:12.440> and<00:02:13.010> I'm<00:02:14.000> quite

00:02:14.320 --> 00:02:14.330 
say it looks fantastic and I'm quite

00:02:14.330 --> 00:02:16.630 
say it looks fantastic and I'm quite
impressed<00:02:14.510> by<00:02:14.810> this<00:02:14.930> now<00:02:15.830> normally<00:02:16.220> I<00:02:16.400> don't

00:02:16.630 --> 00:02:16.640 
impressed by this now normally I don't

00:02:16.640 --> 00:02:20.170 
impressed by this now normally I don't
normally<00:02:17.030> go<00:02:17.150> for<00:02:17.180> road<00:02:17.480> cars<00:02:17.720> but<00:02:18.380> I<00:02:19.000> think<00:02:20.000> I

00:02:20.170 --> 00:02:20.180 
normally go for road cars but I think I

00:02:20.180 --> 00:02:22.780 
normally go for road cars but I think I
would<00:02:20.480> make<00:02:20.720> an<00:02:20.840> exception<00:02:20.930> for<00:02:21.380> this<00:02:21.700> at<00:02:22.700> the

00:02:22.780 --> 00:02:22.790 
would make an exception for this at the

00:02:22.790 --> 00:02:24.340 
would make an exception for this at the
moment<00:02:22.910> probably<00:02:23.390> not<00:02:23.810> because<00:02:24.020> I'm<00:02:24.320> trying

00:02:24.340 --> 00:02:24.350 
moment probably not because I'm trying

00:02:24.350 --> 00:02:27.610 
moment probably not because I'm trying
to<00:02:24.650> get<00:02:24.830> some<00:02:24.980> new<00:02:25.070> stuff<00:02:25.180> but<00:02:26.410> it<00:02:27.410> is

00:02:27.610 --> 00:02:27.620 
to get some new stuff but it is

00:02:27.620 --> 00:02:30.010 
to get some new stuff but it is
definitely<00:02:28.160> one<00:02:28.310> to<00:02:28.459> add<00:02:28.640> to<00:02:29.060> your<00:02:29.420> collection

00:02:30.010 --> 00:02:30.020 
definitely one to add to your collection

00:02:30.020 --> 00:02:32.880 
definitely one to add to your collection
if<00:02:30.500> you<00:02:30.800> are<00:02:30.830> first<00:02:31.490> of<00:02:31.640> all<00:02:31.700> a<00:02:31.760> hyper<00:02:32.180> car<00:02:32.510> and

00:02:32.880 --> 00:02:32.890 
if you are first of all a hyper car and

00:02:32.890 --> 00:02:36.550 
if you are first of all a hyper car and
super<00:02:33.890> super<00:02:34.520> car<00:02:34.880> fan<00:02:35.090> also<00:02:35.870> if<00:02:36.140> you<00:02:36.230> collect

00:02:36.550 --> 00:02:36.560 
super super car fan also if you collect

00:02:36.560 --> 00:02:38.860 
super super car fan also if you collect
the<00:02:36.650> Lamborghinis<00:02:37.190> previously<00:02:37.670> because<00:02:38.000> this

00:02:38.860 --> 00:02:38.870 
the Lamborghinis previously because this

00:02:38.870 --> 00:02:40.510 
the Lamborghinis previously because this
would<00:02:39.020> go<00:02:39.140> nicely<00:02:39.440> with<00:02:39.620> any<00:02:39.860> Gallardo<00:02:40.370> that

00:02:40.510 --> 00:02:40.520 
would go nicely with any Gallardo that

00:02:40.520 --> 00:02:44.860 
would go nicely with any Gallardo that
you<00:02:40.610> got<00:02:40.820> rode<00:02:41.180> or<00:02:41.540> race<00:02:41.930> version<00:02:42.200> and<00:02:42.790> I<00:02:43.870> think

00:02:44.860 --> 00:02:44.870 
you got rode or race version and I think

00:02:44.870 --> 00:02:47.380 
you got rode or race version and I think
it's<00:02:45.020> quite<00:02:45.230> a<00:02:45.290> good<00:02:45.350> addition<00:02:46.250> because<00:02:46.580> as

00:02:47.380 --> 00:02:47.390 
it's quite a good addition because as

00:02:47.390 --> 00:02:50.050 
it's quite a good addition because as
far<00:02:47.690> as<00:02:47.750> it<00:02:47.959> goes<00:02:48.140> it<00:02:48.410> would<00:02:48.500> be<00:02:48.620> a<00:02:49.220> very<00:02:49.790> good

00:02:50.050 --> 00:02:50.060 
far as it goes it would be a very good

00:02:50.060 --> 00:02:52.270 
far as it goes it would be a very good
car<00:02:50.300> against<00:02:51.020> other<00:02:51.260> Road<00:02:51.620> cars<00:02:51.950> that

00:02:52.270 --> 00:02:52.280 
car against other Road cars that

00:02:52.280 --> 00:02:54.040 
car against other Road cars that
skeptics<00:02:52.850> have<00:02:52.910> released<00:02:53.180> like<00:02:53.630> the<00:02:53.840> McLaren

00:02:54.040 --> 00:02:54.050 
skeptics have released like the McLaren

00:02:54.050 --> 00:02:58.900 
skeptics have released like the McLaren
mp4-12c<00:02:55.209> the<00:02:56.209> GT<00:02:56.720> version<00:02:56.959> is<00:02:57.380> a<00:02:57.410> bit<00:02:57.500> I<00:02:57.920> would

00:02:58.900 --> 00:02:58.910 
mp4-12c the GT version is a bit I would

00:02:58.910 --> 00:03:00.699 
mp4-12c the GT version is a bit I would
say<00:02:59.150> would<00:02:59.270> be<00:02:59.330> probably<00:02:59.750> the<00:02:59.989> best<00:03:00.200> car<00:03:00.470> that

00:03:00.699 --> 00:03:00.709 
say would be probably the best car that

00:03:00.709 --> 00:03:03.070 
say would be probably the best car that
skelux<00:03:01.400> have<00:03:01.489> done<00:03:01.640> at<00:03:01.880> the<00:03:02.000> moment<00:03:02.450> when<00:03:03.020> you

00:03:03.070 --> 00:03:03.080 
skelux have done at the moment when you

00:03:03.080 --> 00:03:04.210 
skelux have done at the moment when you
have<00:03:03.200> to<00:03:03.260> rain<00:03:03.410> to<00:03:03.530> the<00:03:03.560> Bentley<00:03:03.800> comes<00:03:04.070> up

00:03:04.210 --> 00:03:04.220 
have to rain to the Bentley comes up

00:03:04.220 --> 00:03:06.940 
have to rain to the Bentley comes up
about<00:03:04.459> to<00:03:05.060> see<00:03:05.239> if<00:03:05.480> that<00:03:05.660> challenge<00:03:06.050> is<00:03:06.170> it<00:03:06.320> but

00:03:06.940 --> 00:03:06.950 
about to see if that challenge is it but

00:03:06.950 --> 00:03:09.490 
about to see if that challenge is it but
I<00:03:07.160> think<00:03:07.820> as<00:03:08.180> far<00:03:08.209> as<00:03:08.390> road<00:03:08.630> cars<00:03:08.870> go<00:03:09.080> this<00:03:09.350> is

00:03:09.490 --> 00:03:09.500 
I think as far as road cars go this is

00:03:09.500 --> 00:03:11.229 
I think as far as road cars go this is
probably<00:03:09.770> going<00:03:09.890> to<00:03:09.950> be<00:03:10.040> the<00:03:10.220> best<00:03:10.520> handling

00:03:11.229 --> 00:03:11.239 
probably going to be the best handling

00:03:11.239 --> 00:03:14.890 
probably going to be the best handling
now<00:03:12.230> the<00:03:12.290> gear<00:03:12.530> ratio<00:03:12.890> is<00:03:13.130> 11<00:03:13.330> 36<00:03:14.330> and<00:03:14.540> a

00:03:14.890 --> 00:03:14.900 
now the gear ratio is 11 36 and a

00:03:14.900 --> 00:03:17.979 
now the gear ratio is 11 36 and a

motor the magnet positioning is very

00:03:20.510 --> 00:03:22.900

crucial<00:03:21.230> on<00:03:21.500> this<00:03:21.650> car<00:03:21.920> because<00:03:22.340> they've<00:03:22.670> gone

00:03:42.130 --> 00:03:42.140 
axle is probably the best way to counter

00:03:42.140 --> 00:03:44.350 
axle is probably the best way to counter
it<00:03:42.440> if<00:03:43.130> you<00:03:43.310> put<00:03:43.459> a<00:03:43.489> second<00:03:43.880> one<00:03:43.910> at<00:03:44.120> the<00:03:44.209> front

00:03:44.350 --> 00:03:44.360 
it if you put a second one at the front

00:03:44.360 --> 00:03:48.430 
it if you put a second one at the front
this<00:03:44.930> car<00:03:45.200> will<00:03:45.380> rarely<00:03:45.680> come<00:03:46.040> off<00:03:46.190> and<00:03:47.440> you

00:03:48.430 --> 00:03:48.440 
this car will rarely come off and you

00:03:48.440 --> 00:03:49.840 
this car will rarely come off and you
really<00:03:48.860> would<00:03:49.070> have<00:03:49.100> to<00:03:49.250> just<00:03:49.489> fall<00:03:49.640> fall

00:03:49.840 --> 00:03:49.850 
really would have to just fall fall

00:03:49.850 --> 00:03:52.420 
really would have to just fall fall
around<00:03:50.120> all<00:03:50.299> the<00:03:50.420> corners<00:03:50.810> to<00:03:50.989> throw<00:03:51.860> it<00:03:52.010> off

00:03:52.420 --> 00:03:52.430 
around all the corners to throw it off

00:03:52.430 --> 00:03:55.180 
around all the corners to throw it off
so<00:03:53.170> again<00:03:54.170> if<00:03:54.350> you're<00:03:54.440> not<00:03:54.590> a<00:03:54.650> massive<00:03:55.040> fan<00:03:55.070> of

00:03:55.180 --> 00:03:55.190 
so again if you're not a massive fan of

00:03:55.190 --> 00:03:56.890 
so again if you're not a massive fan of
magnets<00:03:55.730> you<00:03:56.000> know<00:03:56.120> just<00:03:56.329> take<00:03:56.480> it<00:03:56.600> out<00:03:56.690> and

00:03:56.890 --> 00:03:56.900 
magnets you know just take it out and

00:03:56.900 --> 00:03:59.440 
magnets you know just take it out and
this<00:03:57.230> car<00:03:57.440> will<00:03:57.730> still<00:03:58.730> be<00:03:58.850> fun<00:03:59.030> to<00:03:59.150> drive

00:03:59.440 --> 00:03:59.450

screws in the car for this there's not a

00:04:45.050 --> 00:04:46.360 
screws in the car for this there's not a
lot<00:04:45.260> to<00:04:45.380> brake<00:04:45.590> on<00:04:45.800> it<00:04:45.920> either

00:04:46.360 --> 00:04:46.370 
lot to brake on it either

00:04:46.370 --> 00:04:48.640

there's<00:04:46.880> just<00:04:47.060> the<00:04:47.390> wind<00:04:47.570> mirrors<00:04:47.870> there<00:04:48.170> but

00:04:48.640 --> 00:04:48.650 
there's just the wind mirrors there but

00:04:48.650 --> 00:04:49.810 
there's just the wind mirrors there but
they<00:04:48.770> are<00:04:48.800> made<00:04:49.010> out<00:04:49.040> of<00:04:49.220> the<00:04:49.340> rubber<00:04:49.610> they're

00:04:49.810 --> 00:04:49.820 
they are made out of the rubber they're

00:04:49.820 --> 00:04:51.490 
they are made out of the rubber they're
not<00:04:49.940> made<00:04:50.060> out<00:04:50.180> of<00:04:50.300> hard<00:04:50.570> plastic<00:04:50.660> which<00:04:51.350> is

00:04:51.490 --> 00:04:51.500 
not made out of hard plastic which is

00:04:51.500 --> 00:04:53.140 
not made out of hard plastic which is
good<00:04:51.710> I<00:04:51.740> quite<00:04:52.010> like<00:04:52.190> rubbery<00:04:52.550> windows

00:04:53.140 --> 00:04:53.150 
good I quite like rubbery windows

00:04:53.150 --> 00:04:55.450 
good I quite like rubbery windows
I<00:04:53.300> think<00:04:53.810> they<00:04:53.930> last<00:04:54.200> a<00:04:54.320> bit<00:04:54.350> longer<00:04:54.470> and<00:04:55.040> don't

00:04:55.450 --> 00:04:55.460 
I think they last a bit longer and don't

00:04:55.460 --> 00:04:57.700 
I think they last a bit longer and don't
take<00:04:55.669> as<00:04:56.540> much<00:04:56.720> damage<00:04:56.930> and<00:04:57.200> don't<00:04:57.320> break<00:04:57.560> as

00:04:57.700 --> 00:04:57.710 
take as much damage and don't break as

00:04:57.710 --> 00:05:00.159 
take as much damage and don't break as
easily<00:04:57.830> and<00:04:58.390> when<00:04:59.390> you<00:04:59.510> do<00:04:59.630> take<00:04:59.840> the<00:04:59.960> car

00:05:00.159 --> 00:05:00.169 
easily and when you do take the car

00:05:00.169 --> 00:05:03.159 
easily and when you do take the car
apart<00:05:00.440> this<00:05:01.100> front<00:05:01.520> part<00:05:01.730> stays<00:05:02.270> on<00:05:02.720> the

00:05:03.159 --> 00:05:03.169 
apart this front part stays on the

00:05:03.169 --> 00:05:07.600 
apart this front part stays on the
actual<00:05:03.500> car<00:05:03.770> as<00:05:04.250> well<00:05:04.640> so<00:05:05.860> when<00:05:06.860> when<00:05:07.340> taking

00:05:07.600 --> 00:05:07.610 
actual car as well so when when taking

00:05:07.610 --> 00:05:10.090 
actual car as well so when when taking
it<00:05:07.700> apart<00:05:07.970> just<00:05:08.300> remember<00:05:09.050> if<00:05:09.350> you<00:05:09.500> take<00:05:09.800> it

00:05:10.090 --> 00:05:10.100 
it apart just remember if you take it

00:05:10.100 --> 00:05:11.440 
it apart just remember if you take it
apart<00:05:10.310> and<00:05:10.370> that's<00:05:10.580> doesn't<00:05:10.820> come<00:05:11.090> off<00:05:11.240> then

00:05:11.440 --> 00:05:11.450 
apart and that's doesn't come off then

00:05:11.450 --> 00:05:13.030 
apart and that's doesn't come off then
don't<00:05:11.720> worry<00:05:11.810> your<00:05:12.020> car<00:05:12.200> isn't<00:05:12.380> broken<00:05:12.680> that's

don't worry your car isn't broken that's

00:05:13.040 --> 00:05:14.790 
don't worry your car isn't broken that's

like<00:05:33.800> it<00:05:34.070> I<00:05:34.280> think<00:05:34.970> if<00:05:35.300> your<00:05:36.080> car<00:05:36.530> and<00:05:36.919> a<00:05:37.040> road

00:05:37.390 --> 00:05:37.400 
like it I think if your car and a road

00:05:37.400 --> 00:05:39.250 
like it I think if your car and a road
car<00:05:37.669> collector<00:05:38.150> as<00:05:38.300> well<00:05:38.510> I<00:05:38.810> think<00:05:38.870> you<00:05:39.080> should

00:05:39.250 --> 00:05:39.260 
car collector as well I think you should

00:05:39.260 --> 00:05:41.890 
car collector as well I think you should
go<00:05:39.410> for<00:05:39.650> it<00:05:39.770> I<00:05:39.919> probably<00:05:40.700> prefer<00:05:40.910> the<00:05:41.240> blue<00:05:41.570> one

00:05:41.890 --> 00:05:41.900 
go for it I probably prefer the blue one

00:05:41.900 --> 00:05:46.180 
go for it I probably prefer the blue one
more<00:05:42.380> to<00:05:43.070> this<00:05:43.220> one<00:05:43.460> but<00:05:44.180> I<00:05:44.540> think<00:05:44.990> as<00:05:45.650> well

00:05:46.180 --> 00:05:46.190 
more to this one but I think as well

00:05:46.190 --> 00:05:47.770 
more to this one but I think as well
just<00:05:46.729> the<00:05:46.790> fact<00:05:47.030> that<00:05:47.060> it's<00:05:47.330> going<00:05:47.570> to<00:05:47.630> be<00:05:47.750> a

00:05:47.770 --> 00:05:47.780 
just the fact that it's going to be a

00:05:47.780 --> 00:05:48.940 
just the fact that it's going to be a
Lamborghini<00:05:48.260> it's<00:05:48.380> gonna<00:05:48.470> be<00:05:48.590> quite<00:05:48.770> popular

00:05:48.940 --> 00:05:48.950 
Lamborghini it's gonna be quite popular

00:05:48.950 --> 00:05:51.730 
Lamborghini it's gonna be quite popular
and<00:05:49.370> the<00:05:49.610> fact<00:05:49.790> that<00:05:49.850> it's<00:05:50.180> the<00:05:51.080> Aventador<00:05:51.650> as

00:05:51.730 --> 00:05:51.740 
and the fact that it's the Aventador as

00:05:51.740 --> 00:05:54.100 
and the fact that it's the Aventador as
well<00:05:51.890> people<00:05:52.190> like<00:05:52.580> the<00:05:52.910> newer<00:05:53.570> versions<00:05:54.050> of

00:05:54.100 --> 00:05:54.110 
well people like the newer versions of

00:05:54.110 --> 00:05:55.150 
well people like the newer versions of
the<00:05:54.169> cars<00:05:54.350> because<00:05:54.530> you've<00:05:54.650> got<00:05:54.740> the<00:05:54.830> Gallardo

00:05:55.150 --> 00:05:55.160 
the cars because you've got the Gallardo

00:05:55.160 --> 00:05:56.950 
the cars because you've got the Gallardo
