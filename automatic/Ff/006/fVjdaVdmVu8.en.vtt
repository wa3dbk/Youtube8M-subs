particular<00:01:57.719> folder<00:01:58.110> and<00:01:58.560> they'll<00:01:58.950> be<00:01:59.130> able<00:01:59.219> to

00:01:59.389 --> 00:01:59.399 
particular folder and they'll be able to

00:01:59.399 --> 00:02:03.850 
particular folder and they'll be able to
recognize<00:02:00.090> this<00:02:00.329> the<00:02:00.899> ego<00:02:01.200> I<00:02:01.229> converter<00:02:02.000> ok

00:02:03.850 --> 00:02:03.860 
recognize this the ego I converter ok

00:02:03.860 --> 00:02:08.339 
recognize this the ego I converter ok
let's<00:02:04.860> switch<00:02:05.040> to<00:02:05.840> let's<00:02:06.840> let<00:02:07.200> others<00:02:07.770> do<00:02:07.950> this

00:02:08.339 --> 00:02:08.349 
let's switch to let's let others do this

00:02:08.349 --> 00:02:10.410 
let's switch to let's let others do this
so<00:02:08.920> I'm<00:02:09.099> your<00:02:09.280> eagle<00:02:09.519> a<00:02:09.549> convertor<00:02:09.969> when<00:02:10.329> you

00:02:10.410 --> 00:02:10.420 
so I'm your eagle a convertor when you

00:02:10.420 --> 00:02:12.209 
so I'm your eagle a convertor when you
get<00:02:10.599> it<00:02:10.750> on<00:02:10.959> the<00:02:11.049> back<00:02:11.260> there<00:02:11.620> is<00:02:11.799> a<00:02:11.829> switch

00:02:12.209 --> 00:02:12.219 
get it on the back there is a switch

00:02:12.219 --> 00:02:14.369 
get it on the back there is a switch
many<00:02:13.060> of<00:02:13.239> you<00:02:13.420> have<00:02:13.780> wondered<00:02:14.019> what<00:02:14.349> that

00:02:14.369 --> 00:02:14.379 
many of you have wondered what that

00:02:14.379 --> 00:02:17.429 
many of you have wondered what that
program<00:02:15.040> switch<00:02:15.250> is<00:02:15.670> for<00:02:16.000> so<00:02:16.629> usually<00:02:17.170> we<00:02:17.290> have

00:02:17.429 --> 00:02:17.439 
program switch is for so usually we have

00:02:17.439 --> 00:02:18.929 
program switch is for so usually we have
a<00:02:17.500> play<00:02:18.040> at<00:02:18.219> all<00:02:18.340> times

00:02:18.929 --> 00:02:18.939 
a play at all times

00:02:18.939 --> 00:02:20.880 
a play at all times
but<00:02:19.420> for<00:02:19.629> a<00:02:19.689> firmware<00:02:19.900> update<00:02:20.200> that's<00:02:20.590> when<00:02:20.799> we

00:02:20.880 --> 00:02:20.890 
but for a firmware update that's when we

00:02:20.890 --> 00:02:22.229 
but for a firmware update that's when we
need<00:02:21.010> to<00:02:21.069> switch<00:02:21.370> it<00:02:21.519> to<00:02:21.549> program

00:02:22.229 --> 00:02:22.239 
need to switch it to program

00:02:22.239 --> 00:02:24.270 
need to switch it to program
so<00:02:22.510> let's<00:02:22.810> I'll<00:02:23.140> do<00:02:23.500> that<00:02:23.859> switch<00:02:24.129> it<00:02:24.250> to

00:02:24.270 --> 00:02:24.280 
so let's I'll do that switch it to

00:02:24.280 --> 00:02:27.569 
so let's I'll do that switch it to
program<00:02:25.230> okay<00:02:26.230> and<00:02:26.439> you<00:02:26.739> plucking<00:02:27.099> your<00:02:27.400> you

00:02:27.569 --> 00:02:27.579 
program okay and you plucking your you

00:02:27.579 --> 00:02:36.379 
program okay and you plucking your you
out<00:02:27.790> converter<00:02:28.150> into<00:02:28.560> your<00:02:29.560> PC<00:02:31.950> at<00:02:32.950> this<00:02:33.159> point

00:02:36.379 --> 00:02:36.389 

00:02:36.389 --> 00:02:39.959 

because<00:02:37.389> you<00:02:37.959> don't<00:02:38.200> have<00:02:38.530> this<00:02:39.250> device

00:02:39.959 --> 00:02:39.969 
because you don't have this device

00:02:39.969 --> 00:02:42.300 
because you don't have this device
installed<00:02:40.540> you<00:02:41.109> will<00:02:41.260> need<00:02:41.439> to<00:02:41.560> point<00:02:41.859> the

00:02:42.300 --> 00:02:42.310 
installed you will need to point the

00:02:42.310 --> 00:02:46.020 
installed you will need to point the
window<00:02:42.670> to<00:02:42.730> that<00:02:43.299> device<00:02:43.720> motor<00:02:44.470> and<00:02:44.769> the<00:02:45.760> next

you really you haven't installed the
driver<00:05:06.340> yet<00:05:06.750> okay<00:05:07.750> so<00:05:07.780> now<00:05:08.110> we<00:05:08.169> have<00:05:08.380> the

00:05:08.909 --> 00:05:08.919 
driver yet okay so now we have the

00:05:14.440 --> 00:05:16.560 
for the chips for the egoic inverter now
we<00:05:14.500> need<00:05:14.800> to<00:05:14.919> do<00:05:15.040> -<00:05:15.340> so<00:05:15.640> physical<00:05:16.180> firmware

00:05:16.560 --> 00:05:16.570 
we need to do - so physical firmware

00:05:16.570 --> 00:05:22.520 
we need to do - so physical firmware
update<00:05:16.900> okay<00:05:17.770> so<00:05:18.340> what<00:05:19.180> you<00:05:19.300> need<00:05:19.480> to<00:05:19.540> do<00:05:19.690> is

00:05:22.520 --> 00:05:22.530 

00:05:22.530 --> 00:05:26.280 

what<00:05:23.530> one<00:05:23.710> quick<00:05:23.919> thing<00:05:24.130> about<00:05:24.900> this<00:05:25.900> firmware

00:05:26.280 --> 00:05:26.290 
what one quick thing about this firmware

00:05:26.290 --> 00:05:28.530 
what one quick thing about this firmware
update<00:05:26.740> is<00:05:26.770> that<00:05:27.340> there's<00:05:27.820> a<00:05:27.880> slight

00:05:28.530 --> 00:05:28.540 
update is that there's a slight

00:05:28.540 --> 00:05:31.380 
update is that there's a slight
limitation<00:05:29.350> right<00:05:29.530> now<00:05:29.710> is<00:05:30.010> that<00:05:30.820> it<00:05:31.090> doesn't

00:05:31.380 --> 00:05:31.390 
limitation right now is that it doesn't

00:05:31.390 --> 00:05:35.760 
limitation right now is that it doesn't
work<00:05:31.660> yet<00:05:32.050> for<00:05:32.640> windows<00:05:33.640> 64-bit<00:05:34.510> systems<00:05:35.169> so

00:05:35.760 --> 00:05:35.770 
work yet for windows 64-bit systems so

00:05:35.770 --> 00:05:37.770 
work yet for windows 64-bit systems so
if<00:05:35.890> you<00:05:36.040> do<00:05:36.160> have<00:05:36.340> a<00:05:36.370> windows<00:05:36.729> 64-bit<00:05:37.240> system

00:05:37.770 --> 00:05:37.780 
if you do have a windows 64-bit system

00:05:37.780 --> 00:05:40.170 
if you do have a windows 64-bit system
you<00:05:38.590> may<00:05:38.740> need<00:05:38.919> to<00:05:39.040> use<00:05:39.250> you<00:05:39.669> know<00:05:39.790> do<00:05:40.030> the

00:05:40.170 --> 00:05:40.180 
you may need to use you know do the

00:05:40.180 --> 00:05:42.659 
you may need to use you know do the
update<00:05:40.570> on<00:05:40.780> a<00:05:40.810> 32-bit<00:05:41.650> system<00:05:42.070> first<00:05:42.310> and

00:05:42.659 --> 00:05:42.669 
update on a 32-bit system first and

00:05:42.669 --> 00:05:44.490 
update on a 32-bit system first and
you'll<00:05:43.240> be<00:05:43.419> able<00:05:43.540> to<00:05:43.630> use<00:05:43.810> the<00:05:43.990> ego<00:05:44.229> added

00:05:44.490 --> 00:05:44.500 
you'll be able to use the ego added

00:05:44.500 --> 00:05:46.800 
you'll be able to use the ego added
software<00:05:44.979> in<00:05:45.490> the<00:05:45.669> 64-bit<00:05:46.240> environment

00:05:50.520 --> 00:05:50.530 
needs to be done on a 32-bit environment

00:05:50.530 --> 00:05:55.980 
needs to be done on a 32-bit environment
and<00:05:52.830> let's<00:05:53.830> see<00:05:54.070> and<00:05:54.630> worst<00:05:55.630> comes<00:05:55.840> to<00:05:55.900> worst

00:05:55.980 --> 00:05:55.990 
and let's see and worst comes to worst

00:05:55.990 --> 00:05:57.659 
and let's see and worst comes to worst
if<00:05:56.260> you<00:05:56.350> really<00:05:56.590> can't<00:05:56.800> find<00:05:56.890> a<00:05:57.190> 32-bit

00:05:57.659 --> 00:05:57.669 
if you really can't find a 32-bit

00:05:57.669 --> 00:06:00.600 
if you really can't find a 32-bit
environment<00:05:58.240> you<00:05:58.630> can<00:05:58.810> try<00:05:59.080> to<00:05:59.140> get<00:05:59.610> software

00:06:00.600 --> 00:06:00.610 
environment you can try to get software

00:06:00.610 --> 00:06:04.170 
environment you can try to get software
out<00:06:00.790> there<00:06:00.820> call<00:06:01.300> VMware<00:06:02.229> Player<00:06:02.620> and<00:06:03.180> that

00:06:04.170 --> 00:06:04.180 
out there call VMware Player and that

00:06:04.180 --> 00:06:06.480 
out there call VMware Player and that
allows<00:06:04.419> you<00:06:04.690> to<00:06:04.900> virtualize<00:06:05.530> a<00:06:05.890> 32-bit

00:06:06.480 --> 00:06:06.490 
allows you to virtualize a 32-bit

00:06:06.490 --> 00:06:08.700 
allows you to virtualize a 32-bit
environment<00:06:07.090> you<00:06:07.750> may<00:06:07.840> need<00:06:07.990> a<00:06:08.050> Windows<00:06:08.440> PC

00:06:08.700 --> 00:06:08.710 
environment you may need a Windows PC

00:06:08.710 --> 00:06:10.650 
environment you may need a Windows PC
for<00:06:09.130> that<00:06:09.280> but<00:06:09.790> hopefully<00:06:09.910> you<00:06:10.300> don't<00:06:10.360> need<00:06:10.540> to

00:06:10.650 --> 00:06:10.660 
for that but hopefully you don't need to

00:06:10.660 --> 00:06:13.890 
for that but hopefully you don't need to
you<00:06:11.020> know<00:06:11.140> get<00:06:11.560> to<00:06:11.680> that<00:06:11.830> point<00:06:12.240> okay<00:06:13.240> so<00:06:13.750> let's

00:06:13.890 --> 00:06:13.900 
you know get to that point okay so let's

00:06:13.900 --> 00:06:18.300 
you know get to that point okay so let's
get<00:06:14.020> started<00:06:14.970> we<00:06:15.970> have<00:06:16.000> now<00:06:16.740> we<00:06:17.740> now<00:06:17.919> have<00:06:18.160> the

00:06:18.300 --> 00:06:18.310 
get started we have now we now have the

00:06:18.310 --> 00:06:21.120 
get started we have now we now have the
ego<00:06:18.550> ID<00:06:18.729> converter<00:06:19.120> plugged<00:06:19.510> in<00:06:19.780> right<00:06:20.560> and<00:06:20.830> in

00:06:28.560 --> 00:06:28.570 
to do is switch the you got converter

00:06:28.570 --> 00:06:31.350 
to do is switch the you got converter
from<00:06:28.840> program<00:06:29.260> back<00:06:29.500> into<00:06:29.830> play<00:06:30.150> okay<00:06:31.150> let's

00:06:31.350 --> 00:06:31.360 
from program back into play okay let's

00:06:31.360 --> 00:06:33.570 
from program back into play okay let's
do<00:06:31.510> that<00:06:31.660> so<00:06:31.960> everybody<00:06:32.350> get<00:06:32.560> you<00:06:33.280> know<00:06:33.370> there
