or<00:00:46.630> what<00:00:47.590> I<00:00:47.620> like<00:00:47.860> to<00:00:48.010> do<00:00:48.160> is<00:00:48.430> upload<00:00:48.850> a<00:00:48.970> photo

00:00:49.290 --> 00:00:49.300 
or what I like to do is upload a photo

00:00:49.300 --> 00:00:51.870 
or what I like to do is upload a photo
it<00:00:49.960> is<00:00:50.260> very<00:00:50.680> hard<00:00:50.890> to<00:00:50.980> do<00:00:51.220> this<00:00:51.400> sometimes

00:00:51.870 --> 00:00:51.880 
it is very hard to do this sometimes

00:00:51.880 --> 00:00:53.430 
it is very hard to do this sometimes
though<00:00:52.180> because<00:00:52.390> you<00:00:52.989> have<00:00:53.110> to<00:00:53.230> have<00:00:53.320> it

00:00:53.430 --> 00:00:53.440 
though because you have to have it

00:00:53.440 --> 00:00:57.030 
though because you have to have it
exactly<00:00:54.220> the<00:00:54.370> right<00:00:54.489> size<00:00:55.080> so<00:00:56.080> you<00:00:56.860> basically

00:00:57.030 --> 00:00:57.040 
exactly the right size so you basically

00:00:57.040 --> 00:01:00.509 
exactly the right size so you basically
just<00:00:57.309> look<00:00:57.910> it<00:00:58.059> up<00:00:58.180> a<00:00:58.710> channel<00:00:59.710> art<00:01:00.010> you<00:01:00.430> know

00:01:00.509 --> 00:01:00.519 
just look it up a channel art you know

00:01:00.519 --> 00:01:03.540 
just look it up a channel art you know
it<00:01:00.699> doesn't<00:01:00.910> have<00:01:01.150> to<00:01:01.180> be<00:01:01.390> minecraft<00:01:01.900> and<00:01:02.550> you

00:01:03.540 --> 00:01:03.550 
it doesn't have to be minecraft and you

00:01:03.550 --> 00:01:06.420
