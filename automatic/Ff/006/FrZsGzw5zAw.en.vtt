00:03:32.330 --> 00:03:32.340 
bullies but maybe that would just give

00:03:32.340 --> 00:03:35.180 
bullies but maybe that would just give
them<00:03:32.549> pride<00:03:32.849> on<00:03:33.180> beating<00:03:34.019> us<00:03:34.139> down<00:03:34.169> more<00:03:34.650> who

00:03:56.539 --> 00:03:56.549 
career out of it I think there are so

00:03:56.549 --> 00:03:59.509 
career out of it I think there are so
many<00:03:56.669> jobs<00:03:57.060> out<00:03:57.389> there<00:03:57.419> that<00:03:58.409> people<00:03:59.099> don't

00:03:59.509 --> 00:03:59.519 
many jobs out there that people don't

00:03:59.519 --> 00:04:01.759 
many jobs out there that people don't
realize<00:04:00.000> have<00:04:00.269> been<00:04:00.480> created<00:04:01.079> yet<00:04:01.109> if<00:04:01.560> that

00:04:01.759 --> 00:04:01.769 
realize have been created yet if that

00:04:01.769 --> 00:04:05.000 
realize have been created yet if that
sounds<00:04:02.400> weird<00:04:02.790> I<00:04:03.209> don't<00:04:03.269> know<00:04:03.599> like<00:04:04.290> maybe<00:04:04.560> you

00:04:05.000 --> 00:04:05.010 
sounds weird I don't know like maybe you

00:04:05.010 --> 00:04:06.710 
sounds weird I don't know like maybe you
could<00:04:05.310> be<00:04:05.400> the<00:04:05.549> next<00:04:05.699> person<00:04:06.000> who<00:04:06.269> invent

00:04:06.710 --> 00:04:06.720 
could be the next person who invent

00:04:06.720 --> 00:04:10.069 
could be the next person who invent
something<00:04:07.019> as<00:04:07.349> magical<00:04:08.010> as<00:04:08.220> an<00:04:08.609> ipod<00:04:09.150> who

00:04:10.069 --> 00:04:10.079 
something as magical as an ipod who

00:04:10.079 --> 00:04:12.680 
something as magical as an ipod who
knows<00:04:10.379> maybe<00:04:11.129> you're<00:04:11.400> the<00:04:11.549> next<00:04:11.760> Walt<00:04:12.120> Disney

00:04:12.680 --> 00:04:12.690 
knows maybe you're the next Walt Disney

00:04:12.690 --> 00:04:15.619 
knows maybe you're the next Walt Disney
I<00:04:12.959> think<00:04:13.470> it<00:04:13.919> takes<00:04:14.250> yourself<00:04:14.879> definitely

00:04:15.619 --> 00:04:15.629 
I think it takes yourself definitely

00:04:15.629 --> 00:04:17.689 
I think it takes yourself definitely
define<00:04:15.989> this<00:04:16.199> out<00:04:16.470> but<00:04:17.039> if<00:04:17.130> we<00:04:17.280> just<00:04:17.519> had<00:04:17.669> a

00:04:17.689 --> 00:04:17.699 
define this out but if we just had a

00:04:17.699 --> 00:04:20.149 
define this out but if we just had a
little<00:04:17.820> push<00:04:18.239> and<00:04:18.419> motivation<00:04:19.109> maybe<00:04:19.709> there

00:04:20.149 --> 00:04:20.159 
little push and motivation maybe there

00:04:20.159 --> 00:04:22.159 
little push and motivation maybe there
wouldn't<00:04:20.370> be<00:04:20.609> so<00:04:20.849> many<00:04:21.000> people<00:04:21.150> dropping<00:04:21.870> out

00:04:22.159 --> 00:04:22.169 
wouldn't be so many people dropping out

00:04:22.169 --> 00:04:24.700 
wouldn't be so many people dropping out
of<00:04:22.200> high<00:04:22.440> school<00:04:22.469> I<00:04:23.130> feel<00:04:23.700> like<00:04:23.880> I'm<00:04:24.060> runs
