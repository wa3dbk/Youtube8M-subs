hey guys it's Edie and welcome to
another<00:00:10.530> comparison<00:00:11.040> video<00:00:11.429> between<00:00:11.490> the<00:00:12.030> HTC

00:00:12.589 --> 00:00:12.599 
another comparison video between the HTC

another comparison video between the HTC
One<00:00:12.840> m9<00:00:13.110> and<00:00:13.650> the<00:00:14.009> HTC<00:00:14.580> One<00:00:14.790> m8<00:00:15.360> in<00:00:15.660> this<00:00:16.139> video

00:00:16.400 --> 00:00:16.410 
One m9 and the HTC One m8 in this video

00:00:16.410 --> 00:00:17.810 
One m9 and the HTC One m8 in this video
I<00:00:16.440> will<00:00:16.680> be<00:00:16.800> running<00:00:16.920> a<00:00:17.130> bunch<00:00:17.250> of<00:00:17.430> tests

00:00:17.810 --> 00:00:17.820 
I will be running a bunch of tests

00:00:17.820 --> 00:00:20.330 
I will be running a bunch of tests
between<00:00:17.970> both<00:00:18.510> phones<00:00:18.840> that<00:00:19.470> include<00:00:19.890> a<00:00:19.980> speed

00:00:20.330 --> 00:00:20.340 
between both phones that include a speed

00:00:20.340 --> 00:00:22.130 
between both phones that include a speed
test<00:00:20.570> benchmarks<00:00:21.570> and<00:00:21.810> a<00:00:21.900> battery

00:00:22.130 --> 00:00:22.140 
test benchmarks and a battery

00:00:22.140 --> 00:00:24.170 
test benchmarks and a battery
performance<00:00:22.439> test<00:00:23.010> but<00:00:23.550> before<00:00:23.580> we<00:00:23.910> jump<00:00:24.119> into

00:00:24.170 --> 00:00:24.180 
performance test but before we jump into

00:00:24.180 --> 00:00:25.910 
performance test but before we jump into
the<00:00:24.390> good<00:00:24.570> stuff<00:00:24.600> let's<00:00:25.080> take<00:00:25.260> a<00:00:25.289> quick<00:00:25.740> look

00:00:25.910 --> 00:00:25.920 
the good stuff let's take a quick look

00:00:25.920 --> 00:00:28.160 
the good stuff let's take a quick look
at<00:00:26.130> their<00:00:26.369> specs<00:00:26.820> now<00:00:27.570> I<00:00:27.599> won't<00:00:27.869> go<00:00:27.990> through

00:00:28.160 --> 00:00:28.170 
at their specs now I won't go through

00:00:28.170 --> 00:00:29.900 
at their specs now I won't go through
all<00:00:28.260> the<00:00:28.500> specs<00:00:28.800> for<00:00:28.980> the<00:00:29.070> sake<00:00:29.250> of<00:00:29.279> time<00:00:29.580> so

00:00:29.900 --> 00:00:29.910 
all the specs for the sake of time so

00:00:29.910 --> 00:00:31.490 
all the specs for the sake of time so
instead<00:00:30.060> you<00:00:30.449> can<00:00:30.630> pause<00:00:30.810> the<00:00:30.840> video<00:00:31.230> if<00:00:31.470> you

00:00:31.490 --> 00:00:31.500 
instead you can pause the video if you

00:00:31.500 --> 00:00:33.590 
instead you can pause the video if you
do<00:00:31.830> need<00:00:32.099> more<00:00:32.279> time<00:00:32.520> to<00:00:32.820> look<00:00:33.000> at<00:00:33.210> them

00:00:33.590 --> 00:00:33.600 
do need more time to look at them

00:00:33.600 --> 00:00:35.000 
do need more time to look at them
alright<00:00:34.110> so<00:00:34.200> that's<00:00:34.350> enough<00:00:34.559> of<00:00:34.649> the<00:00:34.739> talking

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:35.010 
alright so that's enough of the talking

00:00:35.010 --> 00:06:42.520 
alright so that's enough of the talking
let's<00:00:35.430> sit<00:00:35.670> back<00:00:35.700> relax<00:00:36.149> and<00:00:36.840> enjoy<00:00:36.960> the<00:00:37.380> show

00:06:42.520 --> 00:06:42.530 

00:06:42.530 --> 00:06:45.790 

so<00:06:43.520> that<00:06:43.880> was<00:06:44.090> kind<00:06:44.360> of<00:06:44.390> unexpected<00:06:44.570> it<00:06:45.470> seems

00:06:45.790 --> 00:06:45.800 
so that was kind of unexpected it seems

00:06:45.800 --> 00:06:48.430 
so that was kind of unexpected it seems
like<00:06:46.070> the<00:06:46.250> m8<00:06:46.670> is<00:06:46.880> the<00:06:47.180> faster<00:06:47.690> phone<00:06:48.020> even

00:06:48.430 --> 00:06:48.440 
like the m8 is the faster phone even

00:06:48.440 --> 00:06:49.930 
like the m8 is the faster phone even
though<00:06:48.590> the<00:06:48.800> m9<00:06:49.130> is<00:06:49.160> running<00:06:49.670> the<00:06:49.760> latest

00:06:49.930 --> 00:06:49.940 
though the m9 is running the latest

00:06:49.940 --> 00:06:52.240 
though the m9 is running the latest
software<00:06:50.360> maybe<00:06:51.260> the<00:06:51.410> apps<00:06:51.560> are<00:06:51.800> not<00:06:52.040> yet

00:06:52.240 --> 00:06:52.250 
software maybe the apps are not yet

00:06:52.250 --> 00:06:54.280 
software maybe the apps are not yet
optimized<00:06:52.730> for<00:06:52.940> the<00:06:53.090> m9<00:06:53.510> because<00:06:53.960> it<00:06:54.110> really

00:06:54.280 --> 00:06:54.290 
optimized for the m9 because it really

00:06:54.290 --> 00:06:55.750 
optimized for the m9 because it really
doesn't<00:06:54.560> make<00:06:54.620> sense<00:06:54.950> that<00:06:55.100> a<00:06:55.220> phone<00:06:55.550> with

00:06:55.750 --> 00:06:55.760 
doesn't make sense that a phone with

00:06:55.760 --> 00:06:57.820 
doesn't make sense that a phone with
much<00:06:55.940> better<00:06:56.180> specs<00:06:56.600> to<00:06:56.870> lose<00:06:57.080> at<00:06:57.320> a<00:06:57.350> speed

00:06:57.820 --> 00:06:57.830 
much better specs to lose at a speed

00:06:57.830 --> 00:06:59.410 
much better specs to lose at a speed
test<00:06:58.070> also<00:06:58.730> the<00:06:58.850> battery<00:06:58.970> test<00:06:59.330> from

00:06:59.410 --> 00:06:59.420 
test also the battery test from

00:06:59.420 --> 00:06:59.980 
test also the battery test from
Geekbench

00:06:59.980 --> 00:06:59.990 
Geekbench

00:06:59.990 --> 00:07:02.020

implies<00:07:00.380> that<00:07:00.680> the<00:07:00.800> m8<00:07:01.130> has<00:07:01.370> a<00:07:01.400> longer-lasting

00:07:02.020 --> 00:07:02.030 
implies that the m8 has a longer-lasting

typical real-life usage whereas the m9

minutes<00:07:11.840> this<00:07:12.830> is<00:07:12.890> something<00:07:13.310> you<00:07:13.430> shouldn't

00:07:13.720 --> 00:07:13.730 
minutes this is something you shouldn't

00:07:13.730 --> 00:07:15.460 
minutes this is something you shouldn't
expect<00:07:14.060> from<00:07:14.330> a<00:07:14.450> flagship<00:07:14.930> smartphone

00:07:15.460 --> 00:07:15.470 
expect from a flagship smartphone

00:07:15.470 --> 00:07:18.610 
expect from a flagship smartphone
especially<00:07:16.100> from<00:07:16.370> HTC<00:07:16.880> so<00:07:17.810> hopefully<00:07:18.140> HTC

00:07:18.610 --> 00:07:18.620 
especially from HTC so hopefully HTC

00:07:18.620 --> 00:07:20.650 
especially from HTC so hopefully HTC
releases<00:07:19.010> an<00:07:19.130> update<00:07:19.490> really<00:07:19.669> soon<00:07:20.150> because

00:07:20.650 --> 00:07:20.660 
releases an update really soon because

00:07:20.660 --> 00:07:22.990 
releases an update really soon because
the<00:07:20.840> m9<00:07:21.169> is<00:07:21.200> becoming<00:07:22.010> a<00:07:22.190> disappointment<00:07:22.910> for

00:07:22.990 --> 00:07:23.000 
the m9 is becoming a disappointment for

00:07:23.000 --> 00:07:26.050 
the m9 is becoming a disappointment for
a<00:07:23.180> flagship<00:07:23.870> smartphone<00:07:24.760> anyways<00:07:25.760> that's<00:07:25.970> it

00:07:26.050 --> 00:07:26.060 
a flagship smartphone anyways that's it

00:07:26.060 --> 00:07:27.220 
a flagship smartphone anyways that's it
