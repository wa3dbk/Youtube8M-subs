00:00:19.720 --> 00:00:19.730 
chances that were blown there ah try and

00:00:19.730 --> 00:00:21.070 
chances that were blown there ah try and
play<00:00:19.820> something<00:00:20.060> really<00:00:20.359> super<00:00:20.660> solid<00:00:20.960> as

00:00:21.070 --> 00:00:21.080 
play something really super solid as

00:00:21.080 --> 00:00:24.009 
play something really super solid as
white<00:00:21.640> sort<00:00:22.640> of<00:00:22.730> London<00:00:23.029> system<00:00:23.359> with<00:00:23.480> G<00:00:23.689> free

00:00:24.009 --> 00:00:24.019 
white sort of London system with G free

00:00:24.019 --> 00:00:34.600 
white sort of London system with G free
I<00:00:24.230> think<00:00:31.870> so<00:00:32.870> this<00:00:32.990> is<00:00:33.170> a<00:00:33.200> kind<00:00:33.440> of<00:00:33.590> new<00:00:34.100> kind<00:00:34.490> of

00:00:34.600 --> 00:00:34.610 
I think so this is a kind of new kind of

00:00:34.610 --> 00:00:43.240 
I think so this is a kind of new kind of
experiment<00:00:35.270> I've<00:00:35.390> been<00:00:35.510> using<00:00:41.860> this<00:00:42.860> kind<00:00:43.100> of

00:00:43.240 --> 00:00:43.250 
experiment I've been using this kind of

00:00:43.250 --> 00:00:45.690 
experiment I've been using this kind of
systems<00:00:43.550> you<00:00:43.640> got<00:00:43.670> the<00:00:43.880> palm<00:00:44.090> triangle<00:00:44.690> and

00:00:45.690 --> 00:00:45.700 
systems you got the palm triangle and

00:00:45.700 --> 00:00:48.010 
systems you got the palm triangle and
center<00:00:46.700> which<00:00:46.880> is<00:00:46.910> hopefully<00:00:47.210> quite<00:00:47.600> solid

00:00:48.010 --> 00:00:48.020 
center which is hopefully quite solid

00:00:48.020 --> 00:00:57.060 
center which is hopefully quite solid
and<00:00:49.180> maybe<00:00:50.180> g4<00:00:50.780> to<00:00:51.320> be<00:00:51.410> adventurous<00:00:52.540> not<00:00:53.540> sure

00:00:57.060 --> 00:00:57.070 

00:00:57.070 --> 00:00:59.590 

now<00:00:58.070> probably<00:00:58.400> because<00:00:58.760> my<00:00:58.940> age<00:00:59.120> five<00:00:59.420> is

00:00:59.590 --> 00:00:59.600 
now probably because my age five is

00:00:59.600 --> 00:01:09.710 
now probably because my age five is
probably<00:00:59.870> quite<00:01:00.020> good<00:01:00.290> huh<00:01:04.509> mmm

00:01:09.710 --> 00:01:09.720 

00:01:09.720 --> 00:01:12.210 

so<00:01:10.720> is<00:01:10.869> the<00:01:11.020> fear<00:01:11.290> of<00:01:11.320> that<00:01:11.710> when<00:01:11.920> you<00:01:12.040> hunt

00:01:12.210 --> 00:01:12.220 
so is the fear of that when you hunt

00:01:12.220 --> 00:01:15.600 
so is the fear of that when you hunt
takes<00:01:12.490> ages<00:01:13.350> is<00:01:14.350> it<00:01:14.560> compensated<00:01:15.220> by<00:01:15.340> trying

00:01:15.600 --> 00:01:15.610 
takes ages is it compensated by trying

00:01:15.610 --> 00:01:20.810 
takes ages is it compensated by trying
to<00:01:15.640> play<00:01:15.820> super<00:01:16.210> solid<00:01:16.570> like<00:01:16.960> this<00:01:17.970> we'll<00:01:18.970> see

00:01:20.810 --> 00:01:20.820 
to play super solid like this we'll see

00:01:20.820 --> 00:01:23.580 
to play super solid like this we'll see
i'm<00:01:21.820> already<00:01:22.119> getting<00:01:22.350> ruptured<00:01:23.350> hair
