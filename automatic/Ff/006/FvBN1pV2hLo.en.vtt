it<00:01:46.560> and<00:01:46.619> then<00:01:46.740> you<00:01:46.829> can<00:01:46.950> always<00:01:47.159> hand<00:01:47.430> it<00:01:47.549> down

00:01:47.690 --> 00:01:47.700 
it and then you can always hand it down

00:01:47.700 --> 00:01:50.810 
it and then you can always hand it down
and<00:01:48.119> buy<00:01:48.630> the<00:01:48.689> next<00:01:49.049> generation<00:01:49.500> so<00:01:49.729> for<00:01:50.729> the

00:01:50.810 --> 00:01:50.820 
and buy the next generation so for the

00:01:50.820 --> 00:01:52.190 
and buy the next generation so for the
geeks<00:01:51.030> maybe<00:01:51.299> it's<00:01:51.420> not<00:01:51.509> a<00:01:51.570> big<00:01:51.750> question<00:01:52.079> but

00:01:52.190 --> 00:01:52.200 
geeks maybe it's not a big question but

00:01:52.200 --> 00:01:54.109

00:02:20.010 --> 00:02:20.020 
a better processor it's going to be a

00:02:20.020 --> 00:02:23.110 
a better processor it's going to be a
better<00:02:21.100> iPad<00:02:22.100> they're<00:02:22.250> gonna<00:02:22.370> take<00:02:22.670> a<00:02:22.730> look

better iPad they're gonna take a look
you<00:02:23.540> know<00:02:23.630> hopefully<00:02:23.930> it<00:02:24.140> won't<00:02:24.290> be<00:02:24.380> back

00:02:24.580 --> 00:02:24.590 
you know hopefully it won't be back

00:02:24.590 --> 00:02:28.980 
you know hopefully it won't be back
glass<00:02:24.860> it's<00:02:25.130> all<00:02:25.250> just<00:02:26.050> Steve<00:02:27.050> no<00:02:27.980> don't<00:02:28.430> do<00:02:28.580> it

00:02:28.980 --> 00:02:28.990 
glass it's all just Steve no don't do it

00:02:28.990 --> 00:02:31.060 
glass it's all just Steve no don't do it
but<00:02:29.990> no<00:02:30.110> it's<00:02:30.290> going<00:02:30.470> to<00:02:30.530> be<00:02:30.650> a<00:02:30.680> better<00:02:30.890> machine

00:02:31.060 --> 00:02:31.070 
but no it's going to be a better machine

00:02:31.070 --> 00:02:33.040 
but no it's going to be a better machine
so<00:02:31.580> there<00:02:31.730> are<00:02:31.820> some<00:02:32.060> people<00:02:32.210> that<00:02:32.390> are<00:02:32.540> busy

00:02:33.040 --> 00:02:33.050 
so there are some people that are busy

00:02:33.050 --> 00:02:37.150 
so there are some people that are busy
waiting<00:02:33.380> around<00:02:34.360> I<00:02:35.360> think<00:02:35.930> that<00:02:36.140> most<00:02:36.740> people

the average person but that it becomes a

00:02:55.760 --> 00:02:57.130 
the average person but that it becomes a
much<00:02:55.880> more<00:02:56.090> challenging<00:02:56.330> question<00:02:56.870> because

00:02:57.130 --> 00:02:57.140 
much more challenging question because

00:02:57.140 --> 00:02:59.170 
much more challenging question because
it<00:02:57.290> is<00:02:57.410> unlike<00:02:58.280> the<00:02:58.370> iphone<00:02:58.400> which<00:02:58.880> is<00:02:59.000> six

00:03:10.120 --> 00:03:10.130 
after Christmas it becomes it becomes a

00:03:10.130 --> 00:03:13.630 
after Christmas it becomes it becomes a
real<00:03:10.790> debate<00:03:11.600> I<00:03:11.810> think<00:03:12.200> I<00:03:12.410> think<00:03:13.220> it's<00:03:13.310> a<00:03:13.400> huge

00:03:13.630 --> 00:03:13.640 
real debate I think I think it's a huge

00:03:13.640 --> 00:03:15.640 
real debate I think I think it's a huge
question<00:03:13.850> also<00:03:14.660> we<00:03:14.840> have<00:03:14.990> to<00:03:15.140> mention<00:03:15.320> that

00:03:15.640 --> 00:03:15.650 
question also we have to mention that

00:03:15.650 --> 00:03:17.770 
question also we have to mention that
usually<00:03:16.250> when<00:03:16.520> Apple<00:03:17.210> brings<00:03:17.450> out<00:03:17.600> a<00:03:17.630> new

00:03:17.770 --> 00:03:17.780 
usually when Apple brings out a new

00:03:17.780 --> 00:03:21.250 
usually when Apple brings out a new
product<00:03:18.260> the<00:03:18.830> old<00:03:19.040> product<00:03:19.550> gets<00:03:20.080> docked<00:03:21.080> a

00:03:21.250 --> 00:03:21.260 
product the old product gets docked a

00:03:21.260 --> 00:03:23.200 
product the old product gets docked a
hundred<00:03:21.590> bucks<00:03:21.740> off<00:03:22.100> and<00:03:22.490> it<00:03:22.550> becomes<00:03:22.820> cheaper

00:03:23.200 --> 00:03:23.210 
hundred bucks off and it becomes cheaper

00:03:23.210 --> 00:03:25.480 
hundred bucks off and it becomes cheaper
so<00:03:23.720> you<00:03:23.780> could<00:03:24.200> also<00:03:24.350> wait<00:03:24.800> but<00:03:25.010> always<00:03:25.160> but

00:03:25.480 --> 00:03:25.490 
so you could also wait but always but

00:03:25.490 --> 00:03:27.040 
so you could also wait but always but
usually<00:03:25.610> yeah<00:03:26.180> well<00:03:26.450> you<00:03:26.570> could<00:03:26.720> wait<00:03:26.870> and

00:03:27.040 --> 00:03:27.050 
usually yeah well you could wait and

00:03:27.050 --> 00:03:29.080 
usually yeah well you could wait and
odds<00:03:27.320> are<00:03:27.560> that<00:03:27.800> the<00:03:27.980> ipad<00:03:28.100> will<00:03:28.520> be<00:03:28.670> less

00:03:29.080 --> 00:03:29.090 
odds are that the ipad will be less

00:03:29.090 --> 00:03:30.820 
odds are that the ipad will be less
expensive<00:03:29.300> and<00:03:29.900> the<00:03:30.050> new<00:03:30.140> ipad<00:03:30.470> will<00:03:30.590> be<00:03:30.710> the

00:03:30.820 --> 00:03:30.830 
expensive and the new ipad will be the

00:03:30.830 --> 00:03:32.260 
expensive and the new ipad will be the
same<00:03:30.980> price<00:03:31.190> so<00:03:31.400> you<00:03:31.490> could<00:03:31.640> also<00:03:31.820> save<00:03:32.240> money

00:03:32.260 --> 00:03:32.270 
same price so you could also save money

00:03:32.270 --> 00:03:35.080 
same price so you could also save money
on<00:03:32.690> getting<00:03:33.290> the<00:03:34.010> old<00:03:34.100> generation<00:03:34.610> what's<00:03:35.000> a

00:03:35.080 --> 00:03:35.090 
on getting the old generation what's a

00:03:35.090 --> 00:03:36.970 
on getting the old generation what's a
gamble<00:03:35.480> i<00:03:35.510> mean<00:03:35.630> you<00:03:35.690> get<00:03:35.870> you<00:03:36.350> buy<00:03:36.530> an<00:03:36.650> ipad

00:03:36.970 --> 00:03:36.980 
gamble i mean you get you buy an ipad

00:03:36.980 --> 00:03:38.500 
gamble i mean you get you buy an ipad
now<00:03:37.190> maybe<00:03:37.520> they<00:03:37.700> released<00:03:37.970> a<00:03:38.060> new<00:03:38.180> one<00:03:38.330> soon

00:03:38.500 --> 00:03:38.510 
now maybe they released a new one soon

00:03:38.510 --> 00:03:41.500 
now maybe they released a new one soon
after<00:03:38.900> the<00:03:39.290> holidays<00:03:39.730> maybe<00:03:40.730> this<00:03:41.060> one<00:03:41.270> gets

00:03:41.500 --> 00:03:41.510 
after the holidays maybe this one gets

00:03:41.510 --> 00:03:42.700 
after the holidays maybe this one gets
cheaper<00:03:41.840> sooner<00:03:42.080> Colley's<00:03:42.200> but<00:03:42.500> then<00:03:42.620> you've

00:03:42.700 --> 00:03:42.710 
cheaper sooner Colley's but then you've

00:03:42.710 --> 00:03:44.290 
cheaper sooner Colley's but then you've
lost<00:03:42.920> out<00:03:43.160> several<00:03:43.460> months<00:03:43.820> of<00:03:43.940> being<00:03:44.090> able<00:03:44.180> to

00:03:44.290 --> 00:03:44.300 
lost out several months of being able to

00:03:44.300 --> 00:03:46.090 
lost out several months of being able to
use<00:03:44.420> it<00:03:44.540> like<00:03:44.750> you<00:03:44.900> said<00:03:45.020> previously<00:03:45.260> so<00:03:45.860> I

00:03:46.090 --> 00:03:46.100 
use it like you said previously so I

00:03:46.100 --> 00:03:48.370 
use it like you said previously so I
guess<00:03:46.490> I<00:03:46.610> becomes<00:03:46.940> do<00:03:47.120> you<00:03:47.150> need<00:03:47.480> it<00:03:47.600> now<00:03:47.780> or<00:03:48.200> do

00:03:48.370 --> 00:03:48.380 
guess I becomes do you need it now or do

00:03:48.380 --> 00:03:50.650 
guess I becomes do you need it now or do
you<00:03:48.440> just<00:03:48.470> want<00:03:48.950> it<00:03:49.070> now<00:03:49.250> and<00:03:49.520> how<00:03:50.000> much<00:03:50.210> is<00:03:50.510> it

although<00:04:38.780> again<00:04:38.960> my<00:04:39.230> mom<00:04:39.470> I<00:04:39.500> think<00:04:39.980> this<00:04:40.160> would

00:04:40.390 --> 00:04:40.400 
although again my mom I think this would

00:04:40.400 --> 00:04:41.410 
although again my mom I think this would
probably<00:04:40.520> be<00:04:40.730> better<00:04:40.910> for<00:04:41.180> her<00:04:41.240> than<00:04:41.270> a

00:04:41.410 --> 00:04:41.420 
probably be better for her than a

00:04:41.420 --> 00:04:43.420 
probably be better for her than a
computer<00:04:41.720> kids<00:04:42.290> obviously<00:04:42.590> like<00:04:43.070> I<00:04:43.160> would<00:04:43.310> I

00:04:43.420 --> 00:04:43.430 
computer kids obviously like I would I

00:04:43.430 --> 00:04:45.220 
computer kids obviously like I would I
think<00:04:43.880> a<00:04:43.970> kid<00:04:44.180> would<00:04:44.330> would<00:04:44.780> much<00:04:45.020> more

00:04:45.220 --> 00:04:45.230

think a kid would would much more
appreciate<00:04:45.590> this<00:04:45.800> than<00:04:46.100> a<00:04:46.550> computer

00:04:46.840 --> 00:04:46.850 
appreciate this than a computer

00:04:46.850 --> 00:04:49.420 
appreciate this than a computer
especially<00:04:47.090> at<00:04:47.300> a<00:04:47.330> young<00:04:47.390> age<00:04:47.540> yeah<00:04:48.140> yeah<00:04:48.650> but

on the character you take traveling with

00:04:52.670 --> 00:04:54.790 
on the character you take traveling with
you<00:04:52.820> it's<00:04:52.970> a<00:04:53.090> almost<00:04:53.660> like<00:04:53.840> a<00:04:53.870> like<00:04:54.680> an

00:04:54.790 --> 00:04:54.800 
you it's a almost like a like an

00:04:58.750 --> 00:04:58.760 
peripheral of sorts so is it worth the

00:04:58.760 --> 00:04:59.980
