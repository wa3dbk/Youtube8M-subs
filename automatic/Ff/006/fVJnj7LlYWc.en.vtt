the way make analysis color for this
lighting<00:04:59.490> setup<00:05:00.860> let's<00:05:01.860> give<00:05:02.009> it<00:05:02.069> a<00:05:02.189> name

then I'm gonna quit
the<00:05:11.930> spider<00:05:12.170> checker<00:05:12.470> software<00:05:13.720> then<00:05:14.720> I<00:05:14.840> go

00:05:14.980 --> 00:05:14.990 
the spider checker software then I go

00:05:14.990 --> 00:05:19.390 
the spider checker software then I go
back<00:05:15.020> to<00:05:15.230> my<00:05:15.260> Photoshop<00:05:17.320> okay<00:05:18.320> I'm<00:05:18.530> gonna<00:05:19.190> open

up all of my spider-man test files in a

00:05:22.790 --> 00:05:30.280 
up all of my spider-man test files in a
CR<00:05:26.710> and<00:05:27.710> I<00:05:28.430> will<00:05:28.730> now<00:05:28.880> apply<00:05:29.060> the<00:05:29.900> preset

CR and I will now apply the preset
created<00:05:30.800> with<00:05:30.980> the<00:05:31.070> spider<00:05:31.310> checker<00:05:31.580> software

00:05:32.490 --> 00:05:32.500 
created with the spider checker software

00:05:32.500 --> 00:05:35.140 
created with the spider checker software
now<00:05:33.500> my<00:05:33.860> normal<00:05:34.220> problem<00:05:34.730> when<00:05:34.910> I<00:05:34.940> shoot

00:05:35.140 --> 00:05:35.150 
now my normal problem when I shoot

00:05:35.150 --> 00:05:38.040 
now my normal problem when I shoot
something<00:05:35.360> red<00:05:35.870> with<00:05:36.290> my<00:05:36.410> servant<00:05:36.800> is<00:05:36.980> that

00:05:38.040 --> 00:05:38.050 
something red with my servant is that

00:05:38.050 --> 00:05:40.990 
something red with my servant is that
Reds<00:05:39.050> tend<00:05:39.380> to<00:05:39.500> blow<00:05:39.680> they<00:05:40.250> block<00:05:40.490> up<00:05:40.670> your<00:05:40.850> to

00:05:40.990 --> 00:05:41.000 
Reds tend to blow they block up your to

00:05:41.000 --> 00:05:43.120 
Reds tend to blow they block up your to
saturated<00:05:41.630> so<00:05:41.870> hopefully<00:05:42.230> you<00:05:42.710> shall<00:05:42.890> paint

00:05:43.120 --> 00:05:43.130 
saturated so hopefully you shall paint

00:05:43.130 --> 00:05:45.970 
saturated so hopefully you shall paint
the<00:05:43.280> colors<00:05:43.640> it's<00:05:44.180> more<00:05:44.420> faithful<00:05:44.930> I<00:05:45.290> get<00:05:45.950> a

00:05:45.970 --> 00:05:45.980 
the colors it's more faithful I get a

00:05:45.980 --> 00:05:49.510 
the colors it's more faithful I get a
better<00:05:46.520> balance<00:05:46.790> of<00:05:47.060> colors<00:05:47.420> ah<00:05:48.370> there<00:05:49.370> we<00:05:49.490> go

00:05:49.510 --> 00:05:49.520 
better balance of colors ah there we go

00:05:49.520 --> 00:05:52.300 
better balance of colors ah there we go
so<00:05:50.480> I'm<00:05:50.540> not<00:05:50.690> gonna<00:05:50.900> adjust<00:05:51.260> this<00:05:51.470> all<00:05:51.950> of<00:05:52.280> my

so I'm not gonna adjust this all of my

00:05:52.310 --> 00:06:00.529 
so I'm not gonna adjust this all of my
values<00:05:52.550> now<00:05:53.110> just<00:05:54.110> fine-tune<00:05:54.710> this<00:05:55.690> yep

00:06:00.529 --> 00:06:00.539 

00:06:00.539 --> 00:06:04.769

00:06:29.450 --> 00:06:29.460 

00:06:29.460 --> 00:06:33.879 

all<00:06:29.850> cameras<00:06:31.039> will<00:06:32.039> see<00:06:32.310> color<00:06:32.850> differently

00:06:33.879 --> 00:06:33.889 
all cameras will see color differently

one of the challenges I face with a
certain<00:06:36.690> D<00:06:36.900> is<00:06:37.650> that<00:06:37.889> when<00:06:38.069> I<00:06:38.099> shoot<00:06:38.340> anything

00:06:38.689 --> 00:06:38.699 
certain D is that when I shoot anything

00:06:38.699 --> 00:06:41.719 
certain D is that when I shoot anything
that<00:06:38.880> this<00:06:39.060> bright<00:06:39.330> red<00:06:40.130> it<00:06:41.130> tends<00:06:41.460> to<00:06:41.550> this

00:06:41.719 --> 00:06:41.729 
that this bright red it tends to this

00:06:41.729 --> 00:06:44.689 
that this bright red it tends to this
too<00:06:42.060> saturated<00:06:42.349> it's<00:06:43.349> hard<00:06:43.800> to<00:06:44.160> separate<00:06:44.550> a

00:06:44.689 --> 00:06:44.699 
too saturated it's hard to separate a

00:06:44.699 --> 00:06:47.469 
too saturated it's hard to separate a
detail<00:06:45.120> of<00:06:45.270> one<00:06:45.810> red<00:06:46.110> object<00:06:46.620> from<00:06:46.770> another

that's<00:06:48.479> where<00:06:48.660> the<00:06:48.750> spider<00:06:49.050> checker<00:06:49.410> comes<00:06:49.770> in

00:06:49.969 --> 00:06:49.979 
that's where the spider checker comes in

00:06:49.979 --> 00:06:52.749 
that's where the spider checker comes in
it<00:06:50.610> will<00:06:50.639> help<00:06:51.300> me<00:06:51.479> create<00:06:51.630> an<00:06:51.900> input<00:06:52.080> profile

00:06:52.749 --> 00:06:52.759 
it will help me create an input profile

00:06:52.759 --> 00:06:55.969 
it will help me create an input profile
it<00:06:53.759> will<00:06:54.090> create<00:06:54.479> a<00:06:54.569> better<00:06:54.930> description<00:06:55.500> of

00:06:55.969 --> 00:06:55.979 
it will create a better description of

00:06:55.979 --> 00:06:59.990 
it will create a better description of
how<00:06:56.490> my<00:06:56.970> camera<00:06:57.479> sees<00:06:57.870> color<00:06:58.289> and<00:06:58.880> it's<00:06:59.880> a
