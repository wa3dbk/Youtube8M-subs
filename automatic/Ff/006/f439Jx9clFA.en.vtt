00:00:03.880 --> 00:00:04.800
 What happened? 

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:09.240
 Large ... tank ... shoot. Woeeeeh ......! 

00:00:10.120 --> 00:00:14.980
 Jesus, man. We ran 100 meters or something. Your condition is really worthless. 

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:17.480
 Receive. The kolere. 

00:00:17.480 --> 00:00:18.540
 Where's the car? 

00:00:18.540 --> 00:00:22.040
 General Hijg here had a brilliant plan to leave him. 

00:00:22.040 --> 00:00:24.560
 Hey. That would also have worked if the tank were not suddenly there. 

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:29.360
 You are the KWIJT tank? God, man, Lopez is not going to like that. 

00:00:29.700 --> 00:00:30.500
 Where is he? 

00:00:30.500 --> 00:00:31.440
 * BOEM * 

00:00:33.020 --> 00:00:34.220
 What the hell? 

00:00:34.220 --> 00:00:34.720
 * BOEM * 

00:00:34.740 --> 00:00:35.860
 Goddamnit! 

00:00:35.860 --> 00:00:37.180
 Oh, shit! What the hell is that thing !? 

00:00:37.680 --> 00:00:38.960
 That's the tank! 

00:00:38.960 --> 00:00:42.700
 Hey, uh ... Grif. Do you want to hold the flag otherwise? 

00:00:42.700 --> 00:00:44.380
 No! Get away with that thing! 

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:46.080
 * BOEM * 

00:00:46.080 --> 00:00:47.720
 Why do you keep shooting at the jeep? 

00:00:48.340 --> 00:00:49.940
 Because he has set it as a target. 

00:00:50.020 --> 00:00:50.980
 Target set. 

00:00:50.980 --> 00:00:51.900
 Then remove the target! 

00:00:51.900 --> 00:00:54.780
 The last time I tried that, I shot Church upside down! 

00:00:55.400 --> 00:00:58.600
 Oh okay. Then keep shooting at the jeep. 

00:00:58.600 --> 00:01:03.480
 I don't want to be annoying ... But I think we are screwed. 

00:01:03.480 --> 00:01:06.440
 Yes, I have to agree with the rookie. 

00:01:06.740 --> 00:01:08.740
 * Radio tunes * 

00:01:08.900 --> 00:01:15.320
 Blood Gulch Basis Nr. 1. Contact, Blood Gulch Basis. Contact. Do you hear me? 

00:01:15.320 --> 00:01:17.540
 Oh my god, Sergeant! Is that you!? 

00:01:17.540 --> 00:01:22.360
 Correct, Soldier. I am on my way to your location from De Leiding. 

00:01:22.720 --> 00:01:24.160
 Sir! Simmons here. 

00:01:24.160 --> 00:01:27.880
 Hello, Simmons. I hope everything went well in my absence. 

00:01:27.880 --> 00:01:33.780
 Well, sir ... It's kind of chaotic now. The Groentje has arrived and he has managed to infiltrate the Blue base. 

00:01:34.140 --> 00:01:41.140
 Now we have the flag, the pig is damaged and one of the men is dead. And there is a huge tank ready to destroy our base. 

00:01:41.140 --> 00:01:46.120
 * Radio noise * 

00:01:46.280 --> 00:01:48.280
 Do I have contact with the right basis? 

00:01:48.380 --> 00:01:51.800
 Sergeant. WE'RE GOING HERE! 

00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:57.760
 Well, just a moment then boys. I think I have a solution for your ... tank problem. 

00:01:58.920 --> 00:01:59.420
 Oh-oh. 

00:02:02.900 --> 00:02:06.920
 Hey, Caboose. You better get out of that tank. Just say NOW. 

00:02:06.920 --> 00:02:10.880
 I don't know how it opens! [Night vision activated] 

00:02:10.880 --> 00:02:12.480
 Rookie! Get out! Now! 

00:02:12.480 --> 00:02:20.140
 Okay, Sheila, would you please open the hatch? [LiÃ¨ge driver position opened.] 

00:02:20.160 --> 00:02:24.180
 Thank you for using the M808V Battlefield 

00:02:24.180 --> 00:02:24.680
 * BOEM * 

00:02:24.680 --> 00:02:28.220
 Shit, shit, shit. Get out! 

00:02:29.020 --> 00:02:31.160
 Young boy, that was very close. 

00:02:31.980 --> 00:02:33.740
 Yes, but do you have to look at that tank ... 

00:02:34.320 --> 00:02:42.500
 I'm scared, Dave. Shall i dream? ..... Dave ..... Dave ..... 

00:02:43.400 --> 00:02:46.720
 Sheila! NO! 

00:02:47.120 --> 00:02:52.880
 What? No! Sheila! Sheila! Wait ... who is Sheila? 

00:02:53.760 --> 00:02:57.620
 Sheila is the lady in the tank. She was my girlfriend. 

00:02:57.980 --> 00:03:01.340
 Oh, dude! I knew you could score women with a tank.
