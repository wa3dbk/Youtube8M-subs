00:02:53.840 --> 00:02:53.850 
and and it worked

00:02:53.850 --> 00:02:56.770

it<00:04:23.979> lasts<00:04:24.520> such<00:04:24.850> such<00:04:25.210> a<00:04:25.419> long<00:04:25.750> time<00:04:26.050> and<00:04:26.259> don't

00:04:26.909 --> 00:04:26.919 
it lasts such such a long time and don't

00:04:26.919 --> 00:04:29.219

00:04:33.779 --> 00:04:33.789
