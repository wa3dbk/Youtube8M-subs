00:00:18.340 --> 00:00:22.420
 tutorial about minecraft and today we're going to 

00:00:20.020 --> 00:00:24.310
 have how to make the ties that do not 

00:00:22.420 --> 00:00:26.020
 get to tie your animals 

00:00:24.310 --> 00:00:28.599
 so that you will not have the ones 

00:00:26.020 --> 00:00:30.279
 they are locked in very pens 

00:00:28.599 --> 00:00:34.120
 uncomfortably and it serves me for the 

00:00:30.279 --> 00:00:37.780
 horses and good has nothing votes for the 

00:00:34.120 --> 00:00:39.700
 ball is line and thread and the thread is 

00:00:37.780 --> 00:00:41.800
 get killing spiders that will give 

00:00:39.700 --> 00:00:44.350
 thread and an eye give lost years to 

00:00:41.800 --> 00:00:46.090
 other things indifferent also and 

00:00:44.350 --> 00:00:47.800
 elaborate the life obviously killing it 

00:00:46.090 --> 00:00:49.960
 sexuality in which they resemble in biomes as 

00:00:47.800 --> 00:00:51.520
 what would be the swamps and sometimes they 

00:00:49.960 --> 00:00:53.440
 they generate in the mines if they are lucky or 

00:00:51.520 --> 00:00:56.350
 It is the work of a panda not maybe you can 

00:00:53.440 --> 00:00:59.890
 be mostly your expose or the test the 

00:00:56.350 --> 00:01:01.990
 loop skull and this one avoids four of 

00:00:59.890 --> 00:01:03.940
 thread and a single insulating ball to win 

00:01:01.990 --> 00:01:07.270

00:01:09.340 --> 00:01:12.500
 straps 

00:01:10.850 --> 00:01:14.479
