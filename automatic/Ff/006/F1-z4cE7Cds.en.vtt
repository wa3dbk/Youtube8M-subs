00:00:08.420 --> 00:00:13.639
 today we are going to decorate paper bags are 

00:00:11.809 --> 00:00:15.170
 very simple you can use them for 

00:00:13.639 --> 00:00:17.090
 the details that children bring to 

00:00:15.170 --> 00:00:17.990
 cole for the birthday for a christening 

00:00:17.090 --> 00:00:20.090
 for a communion 

00:00:17.990 --> 00:00:21.439
 you will simply need paper bags 

00:00:20.090 --> 00:00:23.509
 of those you will find in stores 

00:00:21.439 --> 00:00:26.350
 as cardboard bag of legume 

00:00:23.509 --> 00:00:29.840
 color and satin ribbon of cloth or paper 

00:00:26.350 --> 00:00:31.310
 here you have different models in a with 

00:00:29.840 --> 00:00:32.930
 different size and different color like 

00:00:31.310 --> 00:00:35.059
 you see some bigger ones we've put a 

00:00:32.930 --> 00:00:36.800
 small ornament in the area that joins closure 

00:00:35.059 --> 00:00:39.530
 with the tape to get a little more 

00:00:36.800 --> 00:00:41.059
 if they are more fun and if they are more 

00:00:39.530 --> 00:00:44.180
 little girls just with the tape is 

00:00:41.059 --> 00:00:46.040
 enough I hope you like them for 

00:00:44.180 --> 00:00:48.949
 decorating a paper bag we will need 

00:00:46.040 --> 00:00:51.650
 the template 10-12 that you will find in 

00:00:48.949 --> 00:00:53.809
 our website paper bags type 

00:00:51.650 --> 00:00:56.739
 bag of legume and approximately 13 

00:00:53.809 --> 00:01:00.940
 centimeters wide cardboard color 

00:00:56.739 --> 00:01:03.760
 Cutter rule surface to cut 

00:01:00.940 --> 00:01:06.909
 punch or a pen that does not work 

00:01:03.760 --> 00:01:10.400
 hot glue gun scissors 

00:01:06.909 --> 00:01:11.940
 satin ribbon or cloth and optionally a 

00:01:10.400 --> 00:01:14.280
 ornament 

00:01:11.940 --> 00:01:16.950
 we print the template 10-12 in the 

00:01:14.280 --> 00:01:18.780
 colored cardboard we mark with the 

00:01:16.950 --> 00:01:21.110
 punch or a pen that does not work 

00:01:18.780 --> 00:01:23.480
 by the dotted line 

00:01:21.110 --> 00:01:24.970
 We cut with the cutter by the lines 

00:01:23.480 --> 00:01:27.310
 continue 

00:01:24.970 --> 00:01:29.080
 we doubled over the dotted line of 

00:01:27.310 --> 00:01:30.730
 so that the printed line remains 

00:01:29.080 --> 00:01:32.680
 inside 

00:01:30.730 --> 00:01:35.500
 and we filled the paper bag with what 

00:01:32.680 --> 00:01:37.270
 We want to bend the upper end 

00:01:35.500 --> 00:01:39.780
 as many times as necessary until 

00:01:37.270 --> 00:01:42.090
 get the desired height 

00:01:39.780 --> 00:01:43.619
 with the satin ribbon we measure the length 

00:01:42.090 --> 00:01:45.659
 necessary to turn the 

00:01:43.619 --> 00:01:48.170
 bag and we add about 5 centimeters 

00:01:45.659 --> 00:01:48.170
 plus 

00:01:49.120 --> 00:01:52.470
 we cut the ribbon 

00:01:52.640 --> 00:01:56.360
 we stick one end of the tape to the 

00:01:54.680 --> 00:01:57.990
 inner part of the cardboard strip 

00:01:56.360 --> 00:01:59.880
 bent 

00:01:57.990 --> 00:02:01.330
 we will make sure that he is in the 

00:01:59.880 --> 00:02:03.910
 center 

00:02:01.330 --> 00:02:06.040
 we place the cardboard strip and the tape 

00:02:03.910 --> 00:02:07.900
 that is already attached to it in the part 

00:02:06.040 --> 00:02:10.240
 top of the bag 

00:02:07.900 --> 00:02:11.800
 We passed the ribbon around the bag and 

00:02:10.240 --> 00:02:14.770
 we take it out through the horizontal opening 

00:02:11.800 --> 00:02:17.290
 precut we can 

00:02:14.770 --> 00:02:19.000
 leave it like this optionally we can 

00:02:17.290 --> 00:02:23.070
 add some kind of ornament that makes 

00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:23.070
 closing and you're done
