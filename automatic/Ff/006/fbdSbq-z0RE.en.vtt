because<00:01:11.450> my<00:01:12.450> my<00:01:13.290> 12<00:01:13.680> years<00:01:13.950> in<00:01:14.100> the<00:01:14.189> NBA<00:01:14.310> I

00:01:14.510 --> 00:01:14.520 
because my my 12 years in the NBA I

00:01:14.520 --> 00:01:16.700 
because my my 12 years in the NBA I
played<00:01:14.939> against<00:01:15.210> kid<00:01:15.479> for<00:01:15.720> 12<00:01:16.049> years<00:01:16.259> and<00:01:16.409> now

00:01:16.700 --> 00:01:16.710 
played against kid for 12 years and now

00:01:16.710 --> 00:01:18.620 
played against kid for 12 years and now
he's<00:01:16.950> gonna<00:01:17.159> be<00:01:17.280> the<00:01:17.400> head<00:01:17.520> coach<00:01:17.549> so<00:01:18.000> it's<00:01:18.540> a

00:01:18.620 --> 00:01:18.630 
he's gonna be the head coach so it's a

00:01:18.630 --> 00:01:20.719 
he's gonna be the head coach so it's a
little<00:01:18.810> different<00:01:19.049> but<00:01:19.350> I<00:01:19.590> think<00:01:19.619> in<00:01:20.220> a<00:01:20.490> sense

00:01:20.719 --> 00:01:20.729 
little different but I think in a sense

00:01:20.729 --> 00:01:23.330 
little different but I think in a sense
it'll<00:01:21.450> be<00:01:21.630> good<00:01:21.869> for<00:01:21.930> us<00:01:22.200> because<00:01:22.409> you<00:01:22.920> know

00:01:23.330 --> 00:01:23.340 
it'll be good for us because you know

00:01:23.340 --> 00:01:25.730 
it'll be good for us because you know
you're<00:01:23.640> better<00:01:23.880> relate<00:01:24.270> to<00:01:24.509> us<00:01:24.659> you<00:01:25.590> know

00:01:25.730 --> 00:01:25.740 
you're better relate to us you know

00:01:25.740 --> 00:01:27.740 
you're better relate to us you know
probably<00:01:26.070> a<00:01:26.220> little<00:01:26.340> more

00:01:27.740 --> 00:01:27.750 
probably a little more

00:01:27.750 --> 00:01:29.750 
probably a little more
so<00:01:27.990> one<00:01:28.500> of<00:01:28.530> the<00:01:28.710> questions<00:01:28.740> that<00:01:29.160> I<00:01:29.280> have<00:01:29.550> is
