00:00:00.160 --> 00:00:07.230
 well I fought it 

00:00:03.660 --> 00:00:09.650
 I live in bolívar antioquia city in the 

00:00:07.230 --> 00:00:12.990
 town of birth 

00:00:09.650 --> 00:00:16.470
 started the vice more or less 

00:00:12.990 --> 00:00:18.120
 by a teacher who told me his 

00:00:16.470 --> 00:00:19.890
 silver that is power 

00:00:18.120 --> 00:00:22.260
 I saw that I have given a lot in 

00:00:19.890 --> 00:00:24.930
 bikes that I wanted that I got into a 

00:00:22.260 --> 00:00:26.470
 cycling school so what we have 

00:00:24.930 --> 00:00:30.789
 fact 

00:00:26.470 --> 00:00:34.470
 we had started I have four brothers 

00:00:30.789 --> 00:00:34.470
 in my dad my mom 

00:00:35.329 --> 00:00:40.760
 now they are only watching my two 

00:00:39.109 --> 00:00:44.929
 smaller brothers on bicycles 

00:00:40.760 --> 00:00:47.809
 claudio because they look like I've caught 

00:00:44.929 --> 00:00:51.129
 this stake chose this race and 

00:00:47.809 --> 00:00:51.129
 among those born 

00:00:53.450 --> 00:00:58.340
 and I believe that we 

00:00:56.030 --> 00:01:02.500
 we are known for being climbers 

00:00:58.340 --> 00:01:06.320
 because I think the topography of our 

00:01:02.500 --> 00:01:09.170
 territory is like this we have mountains for 

00:01:06.320 --> 00:01:13.070
 everywhere and we got used to 

00:01:09.170 --> 00:01:15.780
 this we are contacts when we are 

00:01:13.070 --> 00:01:18.600
 the mountains when we are well 

00:01:15.780 --> 00:01:20.610
 the truth is that I think we do it very 

00:01:18.600 --> 00:01:24.229
 well I think it's the same are the 

00:01:20.610 --> 00:01:28.130
 Basque runners have a lot of mountains and 

00:01:24.229 --> 00:01:28.130
 on the mountain they go very well 

00:01:30.030 --> 00:01:36.440
 nothing I think with 

00:01:33.500 --> 00:01:38.900
 with 12 and more shared is condemned 

00:01:36.440 --> 00:01:41.660
 because we were always in the same 

00:01:38.900 --> 00:01:43.580
 team of pride paisa with durán 

00:01:41.660 --> 00:01:47.180
 he was also in the paisa pride with 

00:01:43.580 --> 00:01:50.150
 quintana I've been in several and I saw it 

00:01:47.180 --> 00:01:53.150
 I have not been to a World Cup in a 

00:01:50.150 --> 00:01:55.820
 saved is then also we was 

00:01:53.150 --> 00:01:58.610
 very well I think we are very runners 

00:01:55.820 --> 00:02:00.650
 fighters runners with one of 

00:01:58.610 --> 00:02:03.110
 get ahead of doing things right and 

00:02:00.650 --> 00:02:06.410
 We are really friends in the 

00:02:03.110 --> 00:02:08.520
 bicicletada can suddenly change something 

00:02:06.410 --> 00:02:11.570
 suddenly 

00:02:08.520 --> 00:02:13.830
 a little serious let's say it like that but 

00:02:11.570 --> 00:02:16.200
 It is done 

00:02:13.830 --> 00:02:18.290
 down on the bike we're good 

00:02:16.200 --> 00:02:18.290
 friends 

00:02:20.640 --> 00:02:27.580
 no no no, the truth is that not why 

00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:29.920
 we have little support from them and I believe 

00:02:27.580 --> 00:02:32.770
 that more than all we do is for 

00:02:29.920 --> 00:02:36.510
 our team and because we want to leave 

00:02:32.770 --> 00:02:36.510
 forward we want to do things right 

00:02:41.550 --> 00:02:46.230
 I believe that 

00:02:43.770 --> 00:02:47.040
 when we are all good we also 

00:02:46.230 --> 00:02:50.540
 we give a hand 

00:02:47.040 --> 00:02:53.400
 we are from different teams but we look 

00:02:50.540 --> 00:02:56.550
 we try not to chase some between 

00:02:53.400 --> 00:03:00.170
 we of being that the others 

00:02:56.550 --> 00:03:04.190
 pursue a little and then we 

00:03:00.170 --> 00:03:06.750
 our careers but the truth 

00:03:04.190 --> 00:03:09.830
 very low not when 

00:03:06.750 --> 00:03:13.810
 when you see that a Colombian earns 

00:03:09.830 --> 00:03:13.810
 it's really something very far
