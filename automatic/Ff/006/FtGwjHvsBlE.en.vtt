it's<00:00:42.510> pretty<00:00:42.719> awesome<00:00:42.840> but<00:00:43.649> from<00:00:44.070> what<00:00:44.460> i<00:00:44.520> saw

00:00:45.130 --> 00:00:45.140 
it's pretty awesome but from what i saw

00:00:45.140 --> 00:00:48.020 
it's pretty awesome but from what i saw
of<00:00:46.140> it<00:00:46.620> during<00:00:46.860> the<00:00:47.129> trailer<00:00:47.610> as<00:00:47.760> it<00:00:47.879> actually

00:00:48.020 --> 00:00:48.030 
of it during the trailer as it actually

00:00:48.030 --> 00:00:50.930 
of it during the trailer as it actually
sounds<00:00:48.600> like<00:00:48.719> a<00:00:48.750> turbine<00:00:49.410> from<00:00:50.370> a<00:00:50.460> plane<00:00:50.700> is

00:00:50.930 --> 00:00:50.940 
sounds like a turbine from a plane is

00:00:50.940 --> 00:00:52.790 
sounds like a turbine from a plane is
starting<00:00:51.149> up<00:00:51.390> and<00:00:51.600> actually<00:00:52.140> talked<00:00:52.559> about

00:00:52.790 --> 00:00:52.800 
starting up and actually talked about

00:00:52.800 --> 00:00:54.860 
starting up and actually talked about
this<00:00:52.920> before<00:00:53.070> in<00:00:53.520> a<00:00:53.640> zombie<00:00:53.820> map<00:00:54.090> idea<00:00:54.420> i<00:00:54.539> did

00:00:54.860 --> 00:00:54.870 
this before in a zombie map idea i did

00:00:54.870 --> 00:00:56.900 
this before in a zombie map idea i did
but<00:00:55.500> uh<00:00:55.559> what<00:00:56.039> I'm<00:00:56.160> thinking<00:00:56.489> the<00:00:56.579> gun<00:00:56.730> might

00:00:56.900 --> 00:00:56.910 
but uh what I'm thinking the gun might

00:00:56.910 --> 00:00:59.779 
but uh what I'm thinking the gun might
be<00:00:57.030> called<00:00:57.270> is<00:00:57.570> called<00:00:57.809> the<00:00:57.989> turbine<00:00:58.710> gun<00:00:59.010> it's

00:00:59.779 --> 00:00:59.789 
be called is called the turbine gun it's

00:00:59.789 --> 00:01:01.220 
be called is called the turbine gun it's
going<00:00:59.940> to<00:01:00.000> kind<00:01:00.120> of<00:01:00.239> be<00:01:00.510> similar<00:01:00.960> to<00:01:00.989> the

00:01:01.220 --> 00:01:01.230 
going to kind of be similar to the

00:01:01.230 --> 00:01:03.880 
going to kind of be similar to the
thundergun<00:01:01.800> it<00:01:02.100> shoots<00:01:02.370> out<00:01:02.520> gust<00:01:02.879> of<00:01:03.030> air<00:01:03.180> and

00:01:03.880 --> 00:01:03.890 
thundergun it shoots out gust of air and

00:01:03.890 --> 00:01:06.469 
thundergun it shoots out gust of air and
let<00:01:04.890> me<00:01:05.040> go<00:01:05.189> to<00:01:05.250> the<00:01:05.460> second<00:01:05.820> picture<00:01:05.970> right

00:01:06.469 --> 00:01:06.479 
let me go to the second picture right

00:01:06.479 --> 00:01:09.039 
let me go to the second picture right
now<00:01:06.630> and<00:01:06.869> as<00:01:07.320> you<00:01:07.409> can<00:01:07.530> see<00:01:07.560> right<00:01:07.710> now<00:01:07.890> it's

00:01:09.039 --> 00:01:09.049 
now and as you can see right now it's

00:01:09.049 --> 00:01:12.530 
now and as you can see right now it's
spraying<00:01:10.049> a<00:01:10.409> lot<00:01:10.920> of<00:01:11.100> freakin<00:01:11.490> like<00:01:11.700> dust<00:01:12.210> and

air up at the zombies and it's getting
ready<00:01:14.880> to<00:01:14.939> fire<00:01:15.240> and<00:01:16.310> we<00:01:17.310> do<00:01:17.549> get<00:01:17.729> to<00:01:17.850> see<00:01:18.000> a

00:01:18.020 --> 00:01:18.030 
ready to fire and we do get to see a

00:01:18.030 --> 00:01:19.969 
ready to fire and we do get to see a
little<00:01:18.299> peek<00:01:18.540> at<00:01:18.750> the<00:01:18.869> fire<00:01:19.110> zombies<00:01:19.650> there's

00:01:19.969 --> 00:01:19.979 
little peek at the fire zombies there's

00:01:19.979 --> 00:01:22.039 
little peek at the fire zombies there's
a<00:01:20.070> lot<00:01:20.280> of<00:01:20.310> zombies<00:01:20.610> on<00:01:20.970> fire<00:01:21.299> in<00:01:21.540> this<00:01:21.659> map<00:01:21.840> for

00:01:22.039 --> 00:01:22.049 
a lot of zombies on fire in this map for

00:01:22.049 --> 00:01:23.960 
a lot of zombies on fire in this map for
some<00:01:22.200> reason<00:01:22.530> so<00:01:22.710> that's<00:01:22.979> probably<00:01:23.430> one<00:01:23.939> of

00:01:23.960 --> 00:01:23.970 
some reason so that's probably one of

00:01:23.970 --> 00:01:25.850 
some reason so that's probably one of
the<00:01:24.090> new<00:01:24.240> special<00:01:24.720> zombies<00:01:25.110> due<00:01:25.409> to<00:01:25.560> the<00:01:25.680> earth

00:01:31.140 --> 00:01:34.010 
like fire everywhere and stuff like that
in<00:01:31.350> lava<00:01:31.680> but<00:01:32.579> uh<00:01:32.610> yeah<00:01:33.360> it<00:01:33.600> just<00:01:33.630> seems<00:01:33.930> like

00:01:34.010 --> 00:01:34.020 
in lava but uh yeah it just seems like

00:01:34.020 --> 00:01:36.890 
in lava but uh yeah it just seems like
the<00:01:34.200> guns<00:01:34.380> like<00:01:34.680> shooting<00:01:35.490> out<00:01:35.610> very<00:01:36.329> highly

the guns like shooting out very highly

00:01:36.900 --> 00:01:39.740 
the guns like shooting out very highly
powerful<00:01:37.439> projectile<00:01:38.340> like<00:01:38.729> air<00:01:38.909> blast<00:01:39.299> so

00:01:39.740 --> 00:01:39.750 
powerful projectile like air blast so

00:01:39.750 --> 00:01:41.450 
powerful projectile like air blast so

00:01:41.450 --> 00:01:41.460 
let's go to the next picture is going to

00:01:41.460 --> 00:01:44.330 
let's go to the next picture is going to
say<00:01:41.610> a<00:01:41.640> lot<00:01:41.850> and<00:01:42.180> this<00:01:43.049> one<00:01:43.259> shows<00:01:43.560> the<00:01:43.890> gauges

00:01:44.330 --> 00:01:44.340 
say a lot and this one shows the gauges

00:01:44.340 --> 00:01:47.149 
say a lot and this one shows the gauges
and<00:01:44.520> on<00:01:44.729> the<00:01:44.820> right<00:01:45.149> page<00:01:45.360> it<00:01:45.630> says<00:01:46.159> rotations

00:01:47.149 --> 00:01:47.159 
and on the right page it says rotations

00:01:47.159 --> 00:01:49.520 
and on the right page it says rotations
per<00:01:47.280> minute<00:01:47.520> so<00:01:48.509> that<00:01:48.659> kind<00:01:48.810> of<00:01:48.930> shows<00:01:49.200> right

00:01:49.520 --> 00:01:49.530 
per minute so that kind of shows right

00:01:49.530 --> 00:01:51.590 
per minute so that kind of shows right
here<00:01:49.799> that<00:01:50.040> there's<00:01:50.340> a<00:01:50.399> turbine<00:01:50.909> in<00:01:51.180> this<00:01:51.390> gun

00:01:51.590 --> 00:01:51.600 
here that there's a turbine in this gun

00:01:51.600 --> 00:01:53.749 
here that there's a turbine in this gun
and<00:01:51.899> it's<00:01:52.380> cycling<00:01:52.890> up<00:01:53.070> just<00:01:53.369> getting<00:01:53.490> ready

00:01:53.749 --> 00:01:53.759 
and it's cycling up just getting ready

00:01:53.759 --> 00:01:56.660 
and it's cycling up just getting ready
to<00:01:53.850> a<00:01:54.060> block<00:01:54.930> really<00:01:55.380> big<00:01:55.649> powerful<00:01:56.040> gust<00:01:56.520> of

00:01:56.660 --> 00:01:56.670 
to a block really big powerful gust of

00:01:56.670 --> 00:01:58.249 
to a block really big powerful gust of
air<00:01:56.790> so<00:01:57.060> I'm<00:01:57.149> going<00:01:57.270> to<00:01:57.299> call<00:01:57.509> it<00:01:57.540> the<00:01:57.689> turbine

00:01:58.249 --> 00:01:58.259 
air so I'm going to call it the turbine

00:01:58.259 --> 00:02:01.280 
air so I'm going to call it the turbine
gun<00:01:58.530> and<00:01:58.799> hopefully<00:01:59.549> I'm<00:01:59.640> right<00:01:59.909> and<00:02:00.149> I<00:02:00.290> did

00:02:01.280 --> 00:02:01.290 
gun and hopefully I'm right and I did

00:02:01.290 --> 00:02:03.499 
gun and hopefully I'm right and I did
come<00:02:01.530> up<00:02:01.680> with<00:02:01.829> a<00:02:01.860> upgraded<00:02:02.790> version<00:02:03.210> for<00:02:03.479> the

00:02:03.499 --> 00:02:03.509 
come up with a upgraded version for the

00:02:03.509 --> 00:02:05.480 
come up with a upgraded version for the
gun<00:02:03.990> so<00:02:04.320> if<00:02:04.409> we<00:02:04.530> put<00:02:04.680> this<00:02:04.799> in<00:02:04.950> a<00:02:05.009> pack<00:02:05.189> a<00:02:05.219> punch

00:02:05.480 --> 00:02:05.490 
gun so if we put this in a pack a punch

00:02:05.490 --> 00:02:08.529 
gun so if we put this in a pack a punch
it<00:02:05.670> might<00:02:06.329> become<00:02:06.540> the<00:02:07.049> typhoon

00:02:08.529 --> 00:02:08.539 
it might become the typhoon

00:02:08.539 --> 00:02:10.660 
it might become the typhoon
so<00:02:09.200> those<00:02:09.379> are<00:02:09.409> both<00:02:09.649> pretty<00:02:09.860> cool<00:02:10.099> names<00:02:10.340> and

00:02:10.660 --> 00:02:10.670 
so those are both pretty cool names and

00:02:10.670 --> 00:02:12.069 
so those are both pretty cool names and
