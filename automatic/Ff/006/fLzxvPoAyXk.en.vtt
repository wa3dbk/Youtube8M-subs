flower<00:00:16.550> because<00:00:17.550> I<00:00:18.240> was<00:00:18.570> contemplating<00:00:18.930> on

00:00:19.519 --> 00:00:19.529 
flower because I was contemplating on

00:00:19.529 --> 00:00:21.380 
flower because I was contemplating on
whether<00:00:19.740> to<00:00:19.920> do<00:00:20.160> a<00:00:20.400> video<00:00:20.580> review<00:00:20.970> for<00:00:21.150> this

00:00:21.380 --> 00:00:21.390 
whether to do a video review for this

00:00:21.390 --> 00:00:25.279 
whether to do a video review for this
and<00:00:22.160> to<00:00:23.160> be<00:00:23.279> honest<00:00:23.550> there<00:00:24.029> isn't<00:00:24.359> enough<00:00:24.810> to

00:00:25.279 --> 00:00:25.289 
and to be honest there isn't enough to

00:00:25.289 --> 00:00:28.670 
and to be honest there isn't enough to
do<00:00:25.680> a<00:00:25.710> video<00:00:25.949> review<00:00:26.340> for<00:00:27.080> it<00:00:28.080> might<00:00:28.380> sound

00:00:28.670 --> 00:00:28.680 
do a video review for it might sound

00:00:28.680 --> 00:00:31.939 
do a video review for it might sound
quite<00:00:29.250> stupid<00:00:29.820> and<00:00:30.150> might<00:00:30.359> think<00:00:31.109> why<00:00:31.349> should

00:00:31.939 --> 00:00:31.949 
quite stupid and might think why should

00:00:31.949 --> 00:00:34.760 
quite stupid and might think why should
you<00:00:32.040> get<00:00:32.160> this<00:00:32.340> game<00:00:32.579> then<00:00:33.079> but<00:00:34.079> I<00:00:34.140> think<00:00:34.469> that

00:00:34.760 --> 00:00:34.770 
you get this game then but I think that

00:00:34.770 --> 00:00:36.680 
you get this game then but I think that
you<00:00:34.890> need<00:00:35.070> to<00:00:35.100> see<00:00:35.399> for<00:00:35.610> yourself<00:00:35.940> so<00:00:36.570> I'm

hard to explain this game these little
things<00:00:56.370> that<00:00:56.670> start<00:00:57.149> kind<00:00:57.629> of<00:00:57.899> give<00:00:58.109> you<00:00:58.260> a

00:00:58.310 --> 00:00:58.320 
things that start kind of give you a

00:00:58.320 --> 00:01:01.400 
things that start kind of give you a
sense<00:00:58.710> of<00:00:58.890> the<00:00:58.949> story<00:00:59.489> saying<00:01:00.149> our<00:01:00.480> world<00:01:01.109> is

sense of the story saying our world is

00:01:01.410 --> 00:01:06.830 
sense of the story saying our world is
all<00:01:01.620> gray<00:01:02.219> and<00:01:02.250> black<00:01:03.239> and<00:01:03.750> it's<00:01:03.930> horrible<00:01:05.840> but

00:01:08.930 --> 00:01:12.530 
there isn't really a story to it I mean
you<00:01:09.930> can<00:01:10.200> kind<00:01:10.920> of<00:01:11.130> say<00:01:11.340> that<00:01:11.549> this<00:01:11.729> is<00:01:11.790> but<00:01:12.299> at

you can kind of say that this is but at

00:01:12.540 --> 00:01:15.830 
you can kind of say that this is but at
the<00:01:12.689> end<00:01:12.720> of<00:01:12.990> it<00:01:13.580> flower<00:01:14.580> is<00:01:14.909> inexperienced

graphics of this game at one of its best
features<00:02:05.190> I<00:02:05.220> mean<00:02:05.520> it's<00:02:05.700> just<00:02:05.790> so<00:02:06.470> relaxing

up<00:02:11.640> into<00:02:12.060> it<00:02:12.210> and<00:02:12.390> just<00:02:12.540> really<00:02:12.900> lose<00:02:13.380> yourself

00:02:13.820 --> 00:02:13.830 
up into it and just really lose yourself

00:02:13.830 --> 00:02:15.580

00:02:35.180 --> 00:02:35.190 
of a game like it so this is basically

00:02:35.190 --> 00:02:37.690 
of a game like it so this is basically
all<00:02:35.820> you<00:02:36.030> do<00:02:36.300> you<00:02:36.780> go<00:02:37.080> around<00:02:37.200> collecting

00:02:37.690 --> 00:02:37.700 
all you do you go around collecting

00:02:37.700 --> 00:02:39.650 
all you do you go around collecting
petals<00:02:38.700> and<00:02:39.030> you<00:02:39.150> don't<00:02:39.330> even<00:02:39.420> have<00:02:39.600> to

00:02:39.650 --> 00:02:39.660 
petals and you don't even have to

00:02:39.660 --> 00:02:43.070 
petals and you don't even have to
collect<00:02:40.050> these<00:02:40.170> petals<00:02:41.480> there<00:02:42.480> are<00:02:42.630> some

00:02:43.070 --> 00:02:43.080 
collect these petals there are some

00:02:43.080 --> 00:02:45.290 
collect these petals there are some
trophies<00:02:43.680> that<00:02:44.010> you<00:02:44.250> know<00:02:44.370> you<00:02:44.430> save<00:02:44.970> your

00:02:45.290 --> 00:02:45.300 
trophies that you know you save your

00:02:45.300 --> 00:02:47.570 
trophies that you know you save your
pick<00:02:45.600> I<00:02:46.200> think<00:02:46.650> it's<00:02:46.770> one<00:02:46.950> thousand<00:02:47.430> petals

00:02:47.570 --> 00:02:47.580 
pick I think it's one thousand petals

00:02:47.580 --> 00:02:50.570 
pick I think it's one thousand petals
you'll<00:02:48.090> get<00:02:48.300> a<00:02:48.330> trophy<00:02:48.570> for<00:02:48.870> that<00:02:49.580> but

00:02:50.570 --> 00:02:50.580 
you'll get a trophy for that but

00:02:50.580 --> 00:02:55.100 
you'll get a trophy for that but
basically<00:02:50.700> you<00:02:51.600> go<00:02:51.959> for<00:02:52.350> the<00:02:53.480> ones<00:02:54.480> a<00:02:54.720> kind<00:02:54.959> of

00:02:55.100 --> 00:02:55.110 
basically you go for the ones a kind of

00:02:55.110 --> 00:02:58.580 
basically you go for the ones a kind of
circle<00:02:55.709> e<00:02:55.800> circular<00:02:56.700> disk<00:02:57.660> around<00:02:58.110> them<00:02:58.410> like

00:02:58.580 --> 00:02:58.590 
circle e circular disk around them like

00:02:58.590 --> 00:03:00.710 
circle e circular disk around them like
those<00:02:58.769> yellow<00:02:59.100> ones<00:02:59.430> then<00:02:59.700> I<00:02:59.730> just<00:03:00.330> missed

interesting thing about flower is that

00:04:09.330 --> 00:04:11.960 
interesting thing about flower is that
the<00:04:10.110> first<00:04:10.350> level<00:04:10.680> I<00:04:11.040> mean<00:04:11.220> this<00:04:11.340> seems<00:04:11.670> so

00:04:11.960 --> 00:04:11.970 
the first level I mean this seems so

00:04:11.970 --> 00:04:15.110 
the first level I mean this seems so
basic<00:04:12.480> and<00:04:12.630> you<00:04:12.900> just<00:04:13.110> got<00:04:13.320> petals<00:04:13.920> and<00:04:14.370> that's

00:04:15.110 --> 00:04:15.120 
basic and you just got petals and that's

00:04:15.120 --> 00:04:17.780 
basic and you just got petals and that's
it<00:04:15.450> and<00:04:15.480> yeah<00:04:16.079> it<00:04:16.290> will<00:04:16.709> seem<00:04:17.190> like<00:04:17.220> that<00:04:17.669> it

00:04:17.780 --> 00:04:17.790 
it and yeah it will seem like that it

00:04:17.790 --> 00:04:20.780 
it and yeah it will seem like that it
was<00:04:17.910> start<00:04:18.239> and<00:04:19.100> you<00:04:20.100> know<00:04:20.250> when<00:04:20.519> you<00:04:20.549> get

00:04:20.780 --> 00:04:20.790 
was start and you know when you get

00:04:20.790 --> 00:04:22.640 
was start and you know when you get
halfway<00:04:21.150> through<00:04:21.630> the<00:04:21.810> game<00:04:21.989> you'll<00:04:22.049> start<00:04:22.530> to

00:04:22.640 --> 00:04:22.650 
halfway through the game you'll start to

00:04:22.650 --> 00:04:24.920 
halfway through the game you'll start to
realized<00:04:23.310> it<00:04:23.610> was<00:04:23.730> a<00:04:23.760> little<00:04:24.030> bit<00:04:24.330> more<00:04:24.570> to<00:04:24.900> it

00:04:24.920 --> 00:04:24.930 
realized it was a little bit more to it

00:04:24.930 --> 00:04:30.800 
realized it was a little bit more to it
and<00:04:25.820> my<00:04:28.550> my<00:04:29.550> experience<00:04:30.060> was<00:04:30.150> this<00:04:30.330> game<00:04:30.570> has

00:04:30.800 --> 00:04:30.810 
and my my experience was this game has

00:04:30.810 --> 00:04:33.950 
and my my experience was this game has
been<00:04:31.020> very<00:04:31.530> shot<00:04:31.950> I<00:04:32.190> mean<00:04:32.419> haven't<00:04:33.419> played<00:04:33.720> it

00:04:33.950 --> 00:04:33.960 
been very shot I mean haven't played it

00:04:33.960 --> 00:04:36.650 
been very shot I mean haven't played it
a<00:04:33.990> hell<00:04:34.320> of<00:04:34.350> a<00:04:34.560> lot<00:04:34.770> but<00:04:35.160> the<00:04:35.729> time<00:04:36.090> that<00:04:36.419> have

00:04:36.650 --> 00:04:36.660 
a hell of a lot but the time that have

00:04:36.660 --> 00:04:41.770 
a hell of a lot but the time that have
played<00:04:37.020> it<00:04:37.320> I've<00:04:38.250> completed<00:04:38.910> it<00:04:39.180> and<00:04:39.979> well

00:04:41.770 --> 00:04:41.780 
played it I've completed it and well

00:04:41.780 --> 00:04:43.760 
played it I've completed it and well
like<00:04:42.780> it<00:04:42.930> keeps<00:04:43.140> saying<00:04:43.320> there's<00:04:43.590> just

00:04:43.760 --> 00:04:43.770 
like it keeps saying there's just

00:04:43.770 --> 00:04:47.750 
like it keeps saying there's just
nothing<00:04:44.190> else<00:04:44.400> like<00:04:44.640> it's<00:04:45.000> so<00:04:45.419> relaxing

00:04:47.750 --> 00:04:47.760 

00:04:47.760 --> 00:04:54.080 

there<00:04:48.120> we<00:04:48.240> go

00:04:54.080 --> 00:04:54.090 

00:04:54.090 --> 00:04:57.470 

so<00:04:54.750> maybe<00:04:55.430> this<00:04:56.430> is<00:04:56.580> the<00:04:56.669> reason<00:04:56.790> why<00:04:57.030> I

00:04:57.470 --> 00:04:57.480 
so maybe this is the reason why I

00:04:57.480 --> 00:04:59.689 
so maybe this is the reason why I
haven't<00:04:58.380> done<00:04:58.590> a<00:04:58.620> video<00:04:58.800> reviews<00:04:59.370> because<00:04:59.520> i'm

00:04:59.689 --> 00:04:59.699 
haven't done a video reviews because i'm

00:04:59.699 --> 00:05:02.170 
haven't done a video reviews because i'm
kind<00:04:59.910> of<00:05:00.000> a<00:05:00.240> bit<00:05:00.540> loss<00:05:00.750> of<00:05:00.930> words<00:05:01.050> now<00:05:01.380> kind<00:05:01.860> of

00:05:02.170 --> 00:05:02.180 
kind of a bit loss of words now kind of

00:05:02.180 --> 00:05:05.920
