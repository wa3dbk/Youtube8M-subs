00:00:00.650 --> 00:00:04.700
 hello friends welcome to the channel to the sea 

00:00:02.929 --> 00:00:07.009
 is to make age viruete that you already know 

00:00:04.700 --> 00:00:10.820
 which is a channel dedicated to issues of 

00:00:07.009 --> 00:00:13.579
 artistic character or I get it back 

00:00:10.820 --> 00:00:15.650
 in this kitchen that is a kitchen that 

00:00:13.579 --> 00:00:17.929
 has double function sometimes serves to 

00:00:15.650 --> 00:00:20.869
 cooking and others are not used to paint 

00:00:17.929 --> 00:00:25.669
 in this case I'm using it to paint 

00:00:20.869 --> 00:00:28.519
 and I'm going to show you today a very 

00:00:25.669 --> 00:00:30.949
 simple that seems more difficult than 

00:00:28.519 --> 00:00:34.310
 which is really very easy and you can 

00:00:30.949 --> 00:00:37.250
 perform with children and with teenagers from 

00:00:34.310 --> 00:00:39.860
 all levels including education 

00:00:37.250 --> 00:00:41.360
 special as long as they are children that 

00:00:39.860 --> 00:00:44.450
 have no impediment to 

00:00:41.360 --> 00:00:48.050
 handle scissors what I 'm going to 

00:00:44.450 --> 00:00:50.530
 teach how to do are planets like 

00:00:48.050 --> 00:00:50.530
 these 

00:00:53.640 --> 00:00:58.110
 the first step is to fill all our 

00:00:56.160 --> 00:01:01.590
 colored paper we have a paper of 

00:00:58.110 --> 00:01:04.320
 watercolor glued by the edges on a 

00:01:01.590 --> 00:01:07.260
 table first we are going to wet everything without 

00:01:04.320 --> 00:01:09.720
 paint with a roller with a sponge 

00:01:07.260 --> 00:01:11.490
 Leave more water with what we want this 

00:01:09.720 --> 00:01:13.330
 we do it because in this way the 

00:01:11.490 --> 00:01:16.810
 colors 

00:01:13.330 --> 00:01:19.300
 will spread in a more gentle way already 

00:01:16.810 --> 00:01:21.760
 we have wet now we are going to give 

00:01:19.300 --> 00:01:25.180
 colors with a sponge or with the base of 

00:01:21.760 --> 00:01:28.130
 a roller the colors that we think 

00:01:25.180 --> 00:01:30.590
 I am going to give 

00:01:28.130 --> 00:01:32.990
 these colors I have chosen as I could 

00:01:30.590 --> 00:01:36.500
 have chosen others we have to allow 

00:01:32.990 --> 00:01:38.119
 that the children choose the colors themselves 

00:01:36.500 --> 00:01:40.399
 themselves because in this way they 

00:01:38.119 --> 00:01:43.520
 we will help develop the sense of 

00:01:40.399 --> 00:01:45.330
 color and also to express their own 

00:01:43.520 --> 00:01:47.400
 pleasures 

00:01:45.330 --> 00:01:49.080
 I'm not going to put it like that to make it look 

00:01:47.400 --> 00:01:51.740
 best 

00:01:49.080 --> 00:01:51.740
 you see 

00:01:54.360 --> 00:01:58.980
 we have completely colored 

00:01:56.640 --> 00:02:02.550
 our role and we are going to set him apart 

00:01:58.980 --> 00:02:05.430
 side to let it dry while it dries 

00:02:02.550 --> 00:02:08.670
 our paper we are going to make circles 

00:02:05.430 --> 00:02:11.400
 on top of a cardboard and we're going to 

00:02:08.670 --> 00:02:13.500
 trimming can be done with a compass 

00:02:11.400 --> 00:02:16.050
 circles of different sizes the child 

00:02:13.500 --> 00:02:18.750
 who wants to do them like that can do it 

00:02:16.050 --> 00:02:22.950
 this serves to develop the skill 

00:02:18.750 --> 00:02:24.410
 manual and accuracy but the one that does not 

00:02:22.950 --> 00:02:27.650
 so you can do it using 

00:02:24.410 --> 00:02:30.380
 all kinds of circular shapes a cedÃ© 

00:02:27.650 --> 00:02:33.989
 damaged or adhesive tape 

00:02:30.380 --> 00:02:39.450
 covers and so on we make circles of 

00:02:33.989 --> 00:02:43.010
 different sizes on the cardboard 

00:02:39.450 --> 00:02:43.010
 and we cut it 

00:02:43.430 --> 00:02:48.170
 I'm using scissors here 

00:02:45.890 --> 00:02:51.230
 tipped because I did not find others in 

00:02:48.170 --> 00:02:53.659
 the house but it is assumed that you have to 

00:02:51.230 --> 00:02:56.299
 to be without a clear tip we have to leave 

00:02:53.659 --> 00:02:58.159
 that children cut out in them the 

00:02:56.299 --> 00:03:00.650
 circles even if they are education children 

00:02:58.159 --> 00:03:02.540
 special who have many difficulties 

00:03:00.650 --> 00:03:04.639
 in principle you have to try that the 

00:03:02.540 --> 00:03:06.590
 cut them out even if they get it wrong 

00:03:04.639 --> 00:03:09.200
 done when the circles are left very 

00:03:06.590 --> 00:03:10.849
 very irregular with very rare forms the 

00:03:09.200 --> 00:03:15.219
 picture the truth is that it is very 

00:03:10.849 --> 00:03:15.219
 funny and even more expressive 

00:03:15.890 --> 00:03:20.990
 we have already cut out the circles and 

00:03:19.370 --> 00:03:23.569
 Now what we are going to do is paste them 

00:03:20.990 --> 00:03:26.420
 very lightly on top of the paper that 

00:03:23.569 --> 00:03:28.850
 we have colored to paste it we are going to 

00:03:26.420 --> 00:03:31.000
 do by putting small pieces of tape 

00:03:28.850 --> 00:03:31.000
 adhesive 

00:03:32.790 --> 00:03:41.060
 turning the tape over 

00:03:35.600 --> 00:03:44.210
 about herself like that so she sticks by 

00:03:41.060 --> 00:03:46.400
 both sides and we're putting one in 

00:03:44.210 --> 00:03:48.230
 every planet we do not want the 

00:03:46.400 --> 00:03:50.300
 planets stick a lot because then 

00:03:48.230 --> 00:03:54.740
 we're going to have to take off again 

00:03:50.300 --> 00:03:56.960
 just a little bit good we already have the 

00:03:54.740 --> 00:03:59.930
 dry paper it is important that the paper 

00:03:56.960 --> 00:04:02.750
 be completely dry before gluing 

00:03:59.930 --> 00:04:04.910
 above the circles and we have all the 

00:04:02.750 --> 00:04:07.850
 circles with duct tape and let's go 

00:04:04.910 --> 00:04:10.900
 putting them creating the composition that 

00:04:07.850 --> 00:04:13.340
 it seems we have to let the children 

00:04:10.900 --> 00:04:15.710
 put the circles as they want 

00:04:13.340 --> 00:04:18.410
 so that it works in the sense of 

00:04:15.710 --> 00:04:21.650
 composition there will be children that surely 

00:04:18.410 --> 00:04:23.420
 they will put them in an orderly row 

00:04:21.650 --> 00:04:25.280
 totally in a row that's a very 

00:04:23.420 --> 00:04:27.710
 normal that many children do because 

00:04:25.280 --> 00:04:31.370
 there is a certain stage of child development 

00:04:27.710 --> 00:04:34.670
 in which children order the elements 

00:04:31.370 --> 00:04:36.470
 of his drawing of his painting in a row is the 

00:04:34.670 --> 00:04:37.700
 way they have to understand the 

00:04:36.470 --> 00:04:39.740
 space 

00:04:37.700 --> 00:04:43.160
 once all the circles are 

00:04:39.740 --> 00:04:45.950
 placed we are going to put black paint in 

00:04:43.160 --> 00:04:49.490
 a plate and let's extend 

00:04:45.950 --> 00:04:52.610
 on top of everything with the roller the roller 

00:04:49.490 --> 00:04:54.620
 it has to be completely dry this 

00:04:52.610 --> 00:04:57.230
 it's important because if it's wet it 

00:04:54.620 --> 00:05:00.660
 put the color below the circles 

00:04:57.230 --> 00:05:03.960
 and the drawing is damaged 

00:05:00.660 --> 00:05:06.840
 Well, we are already taking the color 

00:05:03.960 --> 00:05:11.440
 and we are giving them with some care 

00:05:06.840 --> 00:05:14.730
 of not getting in principle 

00:05:11.440 --> 00:05:14.730
 usually looks good 

00:05:15.560 --> 00:05:21.500
 the next step is to take a little 

00:05:19.180 --> 00:05:23.330
 white tempera good I have not given 

00:05:21.500 --> 00:05:26.000
 tell you that we are working 

00:05:23.330 --> 00:05:28.580
 with tempered for child or watch use 

00:05:26.000 --> 00:05:30.980
 for infant use is the same thing 

00:05:28.580 --> 00:05:34.100
 can call one way or the other 

00:05:30.980 --> 00:05:36.569
 we put white tempera and we are going to do 

00:05:34.100 --> 00:05:38.879
 some stars 

00:05:36.569 --> 00:05:40.919
 throwing paint brush 

00:05:38.879 --> 00:05:44.089
 teeth I'm going to put this here so that 

00:05:40.919 --> 00:05:44.089
 Look better 

00:05:54.740 --> 00:05:59.240
 You see here, for example, a 

00:05:56.660 --> 00:06:02.460
 subject is then retouched with 

00:05:59.240 --> 00:06:06.030
 black tempera and not notice anything 

00:06:02.460 --> 00:06:09.440
 and finally the last step is to take off 

00:06:06.030 --> 00:06:09.440
 with a little care 

00:06:10.420 --> 00:06:14.340
 the cardboard circles 

00:06:14.350 --> 00:06:22.150
 and the planets are appearing 

00:06:19.630 --> 00:06:25.420
 and this is the result if you want to see 

00:06:22.150 --> 00:06:27.700
 more things about working with children 

00:06:25.420 --> 00:06:29.730
 in plastic creation or about 

00:06:27.700 --> 00:06:32.950
 any other subject of painting and drawing 

00:06:29.730 --> 00:06:37.150
 you can enter the blog the mind in the 

00:06:32.950 --> 00:06:41.910
 hand the address is www painting and 

00:06:37.150 --> 00:06:41.910
 drawing together with up to the view
