00:00:10.760 --> 00:00:16.730
 toco toco toco toco toco toco toco good and 

00:00:14.660 --> 00:00:19.310
 sauce people we continue in these recipes 

00:00:16.730 --> 00:00:22.189
 of live and conscious food and today 

00:00:19.310 --> 00:00:25.460
 let's make a soup soup alive 

00:00:22.189 --> 00:00:27.950
 broccoli soup with tomato turmeric alves 

00:00:25.460 --> 00:00:29.750
 a little bit of everything but we started 

00:00:27.950 --> 00:00:33.550
 already with this recipe we have to do 

00:00:29.750 --> 00:00:36.170
 almond milk then the blender 

00:00:33.550 --> 00:00:37.970
 activated almonds that I made yesterday to the 

00:00:36.170 --> 00:00:40.100
 night I grabbed the almonds I put in the 

00:00:37.970 --> 00:00:42.949
 water bottle and was generally that is 

00:00:40.100 --> 00:00:46.570
 activate them for 12 hours remove the 

00:00:42.949 --> 00:00:49.570
 liquid I put in the blender almonds 

00:00:46.570 --> 00:00:49.570
 water 

00:00:50.740 --> 00:00:58.740
 and now if I process how long 

00:00:54.510 --> 00:00:58.740
 approximately 30 seconds 

00:00:59.110 --> 00:01:03.130
 and it's already thirty seconds as I said and 

00:01:01.330 --> 00:01:04.960
 ready now the ideal would be to strain the 

00:01:03.130 --> 00:01:07.150
 almonds so we have a pure milk 

00:01:04.960 --> 00:01:09.880
 pure but I like rustic 

00:01:07.150 --> 00:01:14.610
 that today I avoided that step we grabbed 

00:01:09.880 --> 00:01:14.610
 tomato broccoli we cut and continue 

00:01:26.130 --> 00:01:33.289
 well then we have tomato broccoli 

00:01:29.039 --> 00:01:33.289
 well cut blender 

00:01:36.230 --> 00:01:43.370
 cut as always broccoli 

00:01:39.680 --> 00:01:45.620
 with that is enough yeast 

00:01:43.370 --> 00:01:47.150
 nutritional beer because I consume a lot 

00:01:45.620 --> 00:01:49.100
 nutritional brewer's yeast because 

00:01:47.150 --> 00:01:51.290
 keeps all the minerals that is 

00:01:49.100 --> 00:01:54.080
 calcium iron has lots of 

00:01:51.290 --> 00:01:56.600
 protein and especially vitamin 

00:01:54.080 --> 00:01:59.060
 complex b if it is nutritional yeast 

00:01:56.600 --> 00:02:00.860
 we have the b12 if we do not buy yeast 

00:01:59.060 --> 00:02:02.930
 of nutritional beer and we also have 

00:02:00.860 --> 00:02:06.050
 large amount of the complex sees as the 

00:02:02.930 --> 00:02:09.979
 rest of the vitamins we put the eba 

00:02:06.050 --> 00:02:12.739
 turmeric durita raw there is powder of 

00:02:09.979 --> 00:02:15.709
 turmeric a spoonful as always 

00:02:12.739 --> 00:02:18.680
 I say marina salt enriched there we go no 

00:02:15.709 --> 00:02:21.980
 so much and notice the madness that the 

00:02:18.680 --> 00:02:25.310
 Little mouth of spirulina gives me the 

00:02:21.980 --> 00:02:28.130
 microalga spirulina also rich in 

00:02:25.310 --> 00:02:29.930
 65% protein protein 

00:02:28.130 --> 00:02:31.910
 interesting for vegetarians and 

00:02:29.930 --> 00:02:35.120
 vegans we have good amount of iron 

00:02:31.910 --> 00:02:37.730
 more iron than milk than meat that 

00:02:35.120 --> 00:02:40.340
 we all have all the vitamins we have 

00:02:37.730 --> 00:02:43.480
 also here the group b 

00:02:40.340 --> 00:02:45.860
 the group b vitamin b12 is in the 

00:02:43.480 --> 00:02:47.810
 Spirulina can be consumed by 

00:02:45.860 --> 00:02:50.019
 hypertensive because it's because it's not a 

00:02:47.810 --> 00:02:52.610
 seaweed a freshwater seaweed water 

00:02:50.019 --> 00:02:54.769
 alkaline then why if we can 

00:02:52.610 --> 00:02:57.410
 consume all all part are 

00:02:54.769 --> 00:03:01.900
 hypertensive all spirulina we add 

00:02:57.410 --> 00:03:01.900
 a little water and we're already going 

00:03:02.540 --> 00:03:07.930
 basil 

00:03:05.180 --> 00:03:10.930
 we're 

00:03:07.930 --> 00:03:10.930
 we learn 

00:03:11.340 --> 00:03:16.459
 oil to emulsify olive oil 

00:03:22.680 --> 00:03:31.710
 good amount of oil 

00:03:25.830 --> 00:03:31.710
 with first fundamental cold press 

00:03:32.840 --> 00:03:37.340
 and because he used that theory for the 

00:03:34.879 --> 00:03:39.890
 unit 9 then always a good oil 

00:03:37.340 --> 00:03:42.220
 organic olive is good we process and 

00:03:39.890 --> 00:03:42.220
 we use 

00:03:44.180 --> 00:03:51.170
 ready ready here then we have the great 

00:03:47.239 --> 00:03:52.819
 broccoli live soup emplazamos devil 

00:03:51.170 --> 00:03:55.209
 2 seconds and take the properties and 

00:03:52.819 --> 00:03:55.209
 finished 

00:04:09.440 --> 00:04:14.600
 well we ended up saw how easy it is 

00:04:12.110 --> 00:04:17.920
 this live feeding is the best 

00:04:14.600 --> 00:04:20.540
 broccoli tomato nutritional yeast 

00:04:17.920 --> 00:04:23.450
 Spirulina turmeric a little salt a 

00:04:20.540 --> 00:04:26.180
 good olive oil as simple as that 

00:04:23.450 --> 00:04:28.490
 live feeding oxygenates the organism 

00:04:26.180 --> 00:04:31.010
 in an alkaline organism the 

00:04:28.490 --> 00:04:33.500
 diseases say no more in a 

00:04:31.010 --> 00:04:36.040
 organism has been the information out 

00:04:33.500 --> 00:04:39.260
 and it's over and it's over why people please 

00:04:36.040 --> 00:04:42.050
 let's begin to oxygenate alkalize the 

00:04:39.260 --> 00:04:44.690
 organism how we achieve that by consuming 

00:04:42.050 --> 00:04:48.620
 every day a good handful of vegetables 

00:04:44.690 --> 00:04:51.260
