the<00:00:30.210> talking<00:00:30.720> to<00:00:30.869> plants<00:00:31.260> experiment<00:00:31.679> as<00:00:32.070> a

00:00:32.120 --> 00:00:32.130 
the talking to plants experiment as a

00:00:32.130 --> 00:00:34.459 
the talking to plants experiment as a
major<00:00:32.759> problem<00:00:33.180> I'm<00:00:33.960> gonna<00:00:34.079> go<00:00:34.200> check<00:00:34.350> the

00:00:34.459 --> 00:00:34.469 
major problem I'm gonna go check the

00:00:34.469 --> 00:00:35.720 
major problem I'm gonna go check the
watering<00:00:34.770> system<00:00:35.070> and<00:00:35.190> see<00:00:35.280> if<00:00:35.370> maybe<00:00:35.520> the

00:00:35.720 --> 00:00:35.730 
watering system and see if maybe the

00:00:35.730 --> 00:00:37.930 
watering system and see if maybe the
timers<00:00:36.090> are<00:00:36.180> off<00:00:36.239> or<00:00:36.780> what's<00:00:37.020> going<00:00:37.260> on

00:00:37.930 --> 00:00:37.940 
timers are off or what's going on

timers are off or what's going on
it<00:00:38.940> looks<00:00:39.149> pretty<00:00:39.450> dry<00:00:39.690> doesn't<00:00:40.170> it<00:00:41.390> the<00:00:42.390> build

00:00:42.680 --> 00:00:42.690 
it looks pretty dry doesn't it the build

00:00:42.690 --> 00:00:44.840 
it looks pretty dry doesn't it the build
team<00:00:42.809> hasn't<00:00:43.469> been<00:00:43.620> up<00:00:43.800> here<00:00:44.010> for<00:00:44.250> a<00:00:44.280> week<00:00:44.550> a

team hasn't been up here for a week a
long<00:00:45.570> hot<00:00:46.410> week<00:00:47.100> now<00:00:47.820> faced<00:00:48.360> with<00:00:48.510> withered

00:00:49.130 --> 00:00:49.140 
long hot week now faced with withered

00:00:49.140 --> 00:00:52.430 
long hot week now faced with withered
dying<00:00:49.530> plants<00:00:50.160> they<00:00:50.730> wish<00:00:50.969> they<00:00:51.210> had<00:00:51.410> one<00:00:52.410> of

00:00:52.430 --> 00:00:52.440 
dying plants they wish they had one of

00:00:52.440 --> 00:00:53.900 
dying plants they wish they had one of
these<00:00:52.590> timers<00:00:52.949> isn't<00:00:53.370> working

00:00:53.900 --> 00:00:53.910 
these timers isn't working

00:00:53.910 --> 00:00:55.670 
these timers isn't working
really<00:00:54.300> that's<00:00:54.840> light<00:00:55.050> so<00:00:55.199> it's<00:00:55.350> not<00:00:55.469> getting

00:00:55.670 --> 00:00:55.680 
really that's light so it's not getting

00:00:55.680 --> 00:01:00.590 
really that's light so it's not getting
any<00:00:55.860> water<00:00:57.500> moisture<00:00:58.969> and<00:00:59.969> this<00:01:00.120> one<00:01:00.390> looks

00:01:00.590 --> 00:01:00.600 
any water moisture and this one looks

00:01:00.600 --> 00:01:04.789 
any water moisture and this one looks
pretty<00:01:00.739> moist<00:01:01.739> on<00:01:02.039> the<00:01:02.100> top<00:01:03.290> but<00:01:04.290> it's<00:01:04.439> dry

00:01:04.789 --> 00:01:04.799 
pretty moist on the top but it's dry

00:01:04.799 --> 00:01:07.640 
pretty moist on the top but it's dry
down<00:01:04.860> there<00:01:05.450> well<00:01:06.450> I<00:01:06.479> guess<00:01:06.810> they<00:01:07.020> don't<00:01:07.170> grow

00:01:07.640 --> 00:01:07.650 
down there well I guess they don't grow

00:01:07.650 --> 00:01:10.910 
down there well I guess they don't grow
on<00:01:07.950> kind<00:01:08.369> words<00:01:08.670> alone<00:01:09.140> the<00:01:10.140> problem<00:01:10.530> is<00:01:10.680> is

00:01:10.910 --> 00:01:10.920 
on kind words alone the problem is is

00:01:10.920 --> 00:01:13.429 
on kind words alone the problem is is
the<00:01:11.549> timer<00:01:12.299> that<00:01:12.540> was<00:01:12.689> letting<00:01:13.020> the<00:01:13.140> plants

00:01:13.429 --> 00:01:13.439 
the timer that was letting the plants

00:01:13.439 --> 00:01:14.899 
the timer that was letting the plants
get<00:01:13.710> water<00:01:13.740> the<00:01:14.220> one<00:01:14.369> that<00:01:14.460> was<00:01:14.549> actually

00:01:14.899 --> 00:01:14.909 
get water the one that was actually

00:01:14.909 --> 00:01:17.359 
get water the one that was actually
feeding<00:01:15.180> into<00:01:15.540> the<00:01:15.630> pots<00:01:15.840> the<00:01:16.619> battery<00:01:16.950> died<00:01:17.130> I

00:01:17.359 --> 00:01:17.369 
feeding into the pots the battery died I

00:01:17.369 --> 00:01:18.980 
feeding into the pots the battery died I
just<00:01:17.729> think<00:01:18.180> the<00:01:18.270> talking<00:01:18.450> plants<00:01:18.930> are

00:01:18.980 --> 00:01:18.990 
just think the talking plants are

00:01:18.990 --> 00:01:20.539 
just think the talking plants are
committing<00:01:19.290> suicide<00:01:19.890> cuz<00:01:20.130> they're<00:01:20.250> listening

00:01:20.539 --> 00:01:20.549 
committing suicide cuz they're listening

00:01:20.549 --> 00:01:22.280 
committing suicide cuz they're listening
to<00:01:20.610> I<00:01:20.729> Love<00:01:21.030> You<00:01:21.180> laddie<00:01:21.450> allowed<00:01:21.869> you<00:01:22.080> all

00:01:22.280 --> 00:01:22.290 
to I Love You laddie allowed you all

00:01:22.290 --> 00:01:26.060 
to I Love You laddie allowed you all
freakin<00:01:22.979> day<00:01:23.450> the<00:01:24.450> only<00:01:24.570> upside<00:01:25.070> every

00:01:26.060 --> 00:01:26.070 
freakin day the only upside every

00:01:26.070 --> 00:01:28.190 
freakin day the only upside every
greenhouse<00:01:26.580> was<00:01:26.850> affected<00:01:27.390> in<00:01:27.479> exactly<00:01:28.020> the

00:01:28.190 --> 00:01:28.200 
greenhouse was affected in exactly the

00:01:28.200 --> 00:01:30.710 
greenhouse was affected in exactly the
same<00:01:28.229> way<00:01:28.710> so<00:01:29.400> although<00:01:29.670> the<00:01:29.970> plants<00:01:30.390> aren't<00:01:30.570> a

00:01:30.710 --> 00:01:30.720 
same way so although the plants aren't a

00:01:30.720 --> 00:01:33.140 
same way so although the plants aren't a
picture<00:01:31.110> of<00:01:31.259> health<00:01:31.500> the<00:01:32.159> experiment<00:01:32.970> is

00:01:33.140 --> 00:01:33.150 
picture of health the experiment is

00:01:33.150 --> 00:01:34.700 
picture of health the experiment is
still<00:01:33.479> valid

00:01:34.700 --> 00:01:34.710 
still valid

00:01:34.710 --> 00:01:36.770 
still valid
now<00:01:34.799> the<00:01:34.860> build<00:01:35.370> team<00:01:35.610> will<00:01:35.640> reap<00:01:36.180> what<00:01:36.600> it's

00:01:36.770 --> 00:01:36.780 
now the build team will reap what it's

00:01:36.780 --> 00:01:38.180 
now the build team will reap what it's
so<00:01:37.020> I<00:01:37.320> think<00:01:37.440> they're<00:01:37.650> come<00:01:37.799> up<00:01:37.920> with<00:01:38.070> our

00:01:38.180 --> 00:01:38.190 
so I think they're come up with our

00:01:38.190 --> 00:01:40.399 
so I think they're come up with our
conclusion<00:01:38.760> what<00:01:38.909> we<00:01:39.000> need<00:01:39.150> to<00:01:39.240> do<00:01:39.420> is<00:01:39.750> pull

00:01:40.399 --> 00:01:40.409 
conclusion what we need to do is pull

00:01:40.409 --> 00:01:42.620 
conclusion what we need to do is pull
the<00:01:40.530> plants<00:01:40.860> out<00:01:40.979> of<00:01:41.040> the<00:01:41.190> pots<00:01:41.630> completely

00:01:42.620 --> 00:01:42.630 
the plants out of the pots completely

00:01:42.630 --> 00:01:45.230 
the plants out of the pots completely
wash<00:01:42.810> the<00:01:43.080> soil<00:01:43.320> off<00:01:43.560> of<00:01:43.590> the<00:01:43.740> roots<00:01:43.830> and<00:01:44.369> weigh

00:01:45.230 --> 00:01:45.240 
wash the soil off of the roots and weigh

00:01:45.240 --> 00:01:48.020 
wash the soil off of the roots and weigh
the<00:01:45.420> plant<00:01:45.690> mass<00:01:45.930> in<00:01:46.440> each<00:01:46.619> greenhouse<00:01:47.520> and

00:01:48.020 --> 00:01:48.030 
the plant mass in each greenhouse and

00:01:48.030 --> 00:01:51.399 
the plant mass in each greenhouse and
that<00:01:48.600> should<00:01:48.810> give<00:01:48.930> us<00:01:49.050> a<00:01:49.259> pretty<00:01:49.470> good<00:01:49.740> result

00:01:51.399 --> 00:01:51.409 
that should give us a pretty good result

00:01:51.409 --> 00:01:54.170 
that should give us a pretty good result

00:03:46.640 --> 00:03:46.650 
number 6 so I went through all the data

00:03:46.650 --> 00:03:48.440 
number 6 so I went through all the data
what<00:03:46.890> your<00:03:47.010> plants<00:03:47.310> did<00:03:47.520> and<00:03:47.730> by<00:03:48.210> and<00:03:48.390> large

00:03:48.440 --> 00:03:48.450 
what your plants did and by and large

00:03:48.450 --> 00:03:51.350 
what your plants did and by and large
actually<00:03:49.230> hands-down<00:03:50.160> talking<00:03:50.940> and<00:03:51.120> music

00:03:51.350 --> 00:03:51.360 
actually hands-down talking and music

00:03:51.360 --> 00:03:52.910 
actually hands-down talking and music
did<00:03:51.840> better<00:03:52.050> than<00:03:52.230> the<00:03:52.320> control

00:03:52.910 --> 00:03:52.920 
did better than the control

00:03:52.920 --> 00:03:55.730 
did better than the control
there<00:03:53.460> was<00:03:53.700> larger<00:03:54.180> biomass<00:03:54.690> larger<00:03:55.350> yield

00:03:55.730 --> 00:03:55.740 
there was larger biomass larger yield

00:03:55.740 --> 00:03:58.760 
there was larger biomass larger yield
bigger<00:03:56.520> pea<00:03:56.820> pods<00:03:57.060> so<00:03:57.870> what<00:03:58.140> do<00:03:58.200> we<00:03:58.260> think<00:03:58.320> is

00:03:58.760 --> 00:03:58.770 
bigger pea pods so what do we think is

00:03:58.770 --> 00:04:01.400 
bigger pea pods so what do we think is
it<00:03:58.920> busted<00:03:59.430> plausible<00:03:59.820> or<00:04:00.240> confirmed<00:04:00.410> well

00:04:01.400 --> 00:04:01.410 
it busted plausible or confirmed well

00:04:01.410 --> 00:04:03.740 
it busted plausible or confirmed well
this<00:04:01.890> team<00:04:02.160> did<00:04:02.400> really<00:04:02.430> good<00:04:03.120> on<00:04:03.300> this<00:04:03.480> job

00:04:03.740 --> 00:04:03.750 
this team did really good on this job

00:04:03.750 --> 00:04:06.170 
this team did really good on this job
but<00:04:04.020> the<00:04:04.860> samples<00:04:04.890> not<00:04:05.520> quite<00:04:05.760> big<00:04:05.880> enough<00:04:05.940> to

00:04:06.170 --> 00:04:06.180 
but the samples not quite big enough to

00:04:06.180 --> 00:04:08.240 
but the samples not quite big enough to
say<00:04:06.300> confirmed<00:04:06.950> however<00:04:07.950> I'm<00:04:08.220> really

00:04:08.240 --> 00:04:08.250 
say confirmed however I'm really

00:04:08.250 --> 00:04:09.080 
say confirmed however I'm really
impressed

it<00:04:09.180> is<00:04:09.300> totally<00:04:09.870> plausible<00:04:10.380> well

00:04:10.940 --> 00:04:10.950 
it is totally plausible well

00:04:10.950 --> 00:04:13.820 
it is totally plausible well
interestingly<00:04:11.790> although<00:04:12.480> talking<00:04:13.320> helps<00:04:13.590> it

00:04:13.820 --> 00:04:13.830
