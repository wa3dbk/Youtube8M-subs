to it but it doesn't look like the

00:00:35.219 --> 00:00:36.889 
to it but it doesn't look like the
trooper<00:00:35.579> commando<00:00:36.000> matches<00:00:36.390> up<00:00:36.540> with<00:00:36.719> either

00:00:39.260 --> 00:00:39.270 
the operator is sniper which is why I'm

00:00:39.270 --> 00:00:40.610 
the operator is sniper which is why I'm
going<00:00:39.390> to<00:00:39.480> go<00:00:39.629> out<00:00:39.750> with<00:00:39.780> this<00:00:39.989> part<00:00:40.290> none<00:00:40.440> and

00:00:40.610 --> 00:00:40.620 
going to go out with this part none and

00:00:40.620 --> 00:00:42.530 
going to go out with this part none and
kind<00:00:40.800> of<00:00:40.860> go<00:00:41.010> over<00:00:41.280> what<00:00:41.489> I<00:00:41.520> think<00:00:41.910> will<00:00:42.390> be<00:00:42.510> the

00:00:42.530 --> 00:00:42.540 
kind of go over what I think will be the

00:00:42.540 --> 00:00:46.220 
kind of go over what I think will be the
best<00:00:43.050> and<00:00:43.320> most<00:00:43.350> ideal<00:00:43.920> dps<00:00:44.489> spec<00:00:44.600> for<00:00:45.600> trooper

00:00:46.220 --> 00:00:46.230 
best and most ideal dps spec for trooper

00:00:46.230 --> 00:00:50.000 
best and most ideal dps spec for trooper
commando<00:00:46.649> arm<00:00:48.469> we're<00:00:49.469> going<00:00:49.559> to<00:00:49.620> go<00:00:49.800> with

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:50.010 
commando arm we're going to go with

00:00:50.010 --> 00:00:52.580 
commando arm we're going to go with
heavy<00:00:50.489> gunnery<00:00:50.910> assault<00:00:51.690> special<00:00:52.079> seems<00:00:52.410> like

00:00:52.580 --> 00:00:52.590 
heavy gunnery assault special seems like

00:00:52.590 --> 00:00:54.350 
heavy gunnery assault special seems like
it<00:00:52.739> could<00:00:52.800> be<00:00:52.860> interesting<00:00:53.160> expect<00:00:54.090> to<00:00:54.210> go

00:00:54.350 --> 00:00:54.360 
it could be interesting expect to go

00:00:54.360 --> 00:00:56.360 
it could be interesting expect to go
into<00:00:54.539> it<00:00:54.840> looks<00:00:55.079> like<00:00:55.260> most<00:00:55.469> of<00:00:55.559> its<00:00:55.710> throwing

00:00:56.360 --> 00:00:56.370 
into it looks like most of its throwing

00:00:56.370 --> 00:00:59.959 
into it looks like most of its throwing
explosives<00:00:57.410> while<00:00:58.410> the<00:00:58.980> gunnery<00:00:59.550> one<00:00:59.789> is

00:00:59.959 --> 00:00:59.969 
explosives while the gunnery one is

00:00:59.969 --> 00:01:01.580 
explosives while the gunnery one is
actually<00:01:00.090> just<00:01:00.329> shooting<00:01:00.809> weapons<00:01:01.260> so<00:01:01.559> I

00:01:01.580 --> 00:01:01.590 
actually just shooting weapons so I

00:01:01.590 --> 00:01:03.619 
actually just shooting weapons so I
think<00:01:01.710> the<00:01:02.340> commander<00:01:02.879> should<00:01:03.149> be<00:01:03.300> able<00:01:03.390> to<00:01:03.539> do

00:01:03.619 --> 00:01:03.629 
think the commander should be able to do

00:01:03.629 --> 00:01:05.840 
think the commander should be able to do
more<00:01:03.809> more<00:01:04.439> damage<00:01:04.920> up<00:01:05.070> front<00:01:05.489> and<00:01:05.670> more

00:01:05.840 --> 00:01:05.850 
more more damage up front and more

00:01:05.850 --> 00:01:07.460 
more more damage up front and more
births<00:01:06.090> damage<00:01:06.510> so<00:01:07.020> that's<00:01:07.170> what<00:01:07.290> I'm<00:01:07.350> going

00:01:07.460 --> 00:01:07.470 
births damage so that's what I'm going

00:01:07.470 --> 00:01:09.170 
births damage so that's what I'm going
to<00:01:07.560> stick<00:01:07.770> with<00:01:07.830> the<00:01:08.040> gunnery<00:01:08.369> tree<00:01:08.729> as<00:01:08.939> we're

00:01:09.170 --> 00:01:09.180 
to stick with the gunnery tree as we're

00:01:09.180 --> 00:01:11.300 
to stick with the gunnery tree as we're

00:01:11.300 --> 00:01:11.310 
leveling and as we're pvping so let's

00:01:11.310 --> 00:01:14.270

to generate one energy cell so we're

00:04:15.560 --> 00:04:16.960

rest of the assault specialist so we're

00:06:24.830 --> 00:06:26.290 
rest of the assault specialist so we're
going<00:06:24.920> to<00:06:25.010> not<00:06:25.130> only<00:06:25.250> increase<00:06:25.460> range<00:06:25.910> by

00:06:26.290 --> 00:06:26.300 
going to not only increase range by

three percent range accuracy by 3% we're

00:06:28.640 --> 00:06:29.860 
three percent range accuracy by 3% we're
going<00:06:28.760> to<00:06:28.820> increase<00:06:29.060> electorate<00:06:29.540> II<00:06:29.600> so

00:06:29.860 --> 00:06:29.870 
going to increase electorate II so

00:06:29.870 --> 00:06:31.900 
going to increase electorate II so
you're<00:06:30.050> able<00:06:30.230> to<00:06:30.410> cast<00:06:30.650> faster<00:06:31.220> and<00:06:31.400> then

00:06:31.900 --> 00:06:31.910 
you're able to cast faster and then

00:06:31.910 --> 00:06:33.240 
you're able to cast faster and then
we're<00:06:32.000> going<00:06:32.090> to<00:06:32.150> have<00:06:32.330> sweltering<00:06:32.900> heat

00:06:33.240 --> 00:06:33.250 
we're going to have sweltering heat

00:06:33.250 --> 00:06:35.530 
we're going to have sweltering heat
plasma<00:06:34.250> cell<00:06:34.460> has<00:06:34.730> a<00:06:34.760> white<00:06:35.090> person<00:06:35.360> chance

plasma cell has a white person chance

00:06:35.540 --> 00:06:37.330 
plasma cell has a white person chance
when<00:06:35.690> it<00:06:35.720> applies<00:06:35.990> to<00:06:36.020> it<00:06:36.500> when<00:06:37.100> it<00:06:37.130> applies

00:06:37.330 --> 00:06:37.340 
when it applies to it when it applies

00:06:37.340 --> 00:06:38.770 
when it applies to it when it applies
effects<00:06:37.729> to<00:06:37.880> reduce<00:06:38.120> the<00:06:38.210> movement<00:06:38.540> of<00:06:38.570> speed

00:06:38.770 --> 00:06:38.780 
effects to reduce the movement of speed

00:06:38.780 --> 00:06:40.490 
effects to reduce the movement of speed
by<00:06:39.200> the<00:06:39.260> enemy

00:06:40.490 --> 00:06:40.500 
by the enemy

00:06:40.500 --> 00:06:45.779 
by the enemy
so<00:06:41.500> I<00:06:41.560> think<00:06:42.840> actually<00:06:44.129> looking<00:06:45.129> at<00:06:45.220> that<00:06:45.430> it

00:06:45.779 --> 00:06:45.789 
so I think actually looking at that it

00:06:45.789 --> 00:06:47.159 
so I think actually looking at that it
looks<00:06:45.939> like<00:06:46.000> we're<00:06:46.810> staying<00:06:46.960> with<00:06:47.110> the

00:06:47.159 --> 00:06:47.169 
looks like we're staying with the

00:06:47.169 --> 00:06:48.990 
looks like we're staying with the
armor-piercing<00:06:47.800> cells<00:06:48.490> so<00:06:48.789> we're<00:06:48.909> actually

00:06:48.990 --> 00:06:49.000 
armor-piercing cells so we're actually

00:06:49.000 --> 00:06:51.779 
armor-piercing cells so we're actually
going<00:06:49.210> to<00:06:49.300> remove<00:06:49.599> this<00:06:49.900> and<00:06:50.400> this<00:06:51.400> is<00:06:51.580> where

00:06:51.779 --> 00:06:51.789 
going to remove this and this is where

00:06:51.789 --> 00:06:53.429 
going to remove this and this is where
it's<00:06:51.969> a<00:06:52.060> little<00:06:52.090> tough<00:06:52.539> I<00:06:52.659> wasn't<00:06:53.020> necessarily

00:06:53.429 --> 00:06:53.439 
it's a little tough I wasn't necessarily

00:06:53.439 --> 00:06:55.649 
it's a little tough I wasn't necessarily
sure<00:06:53.680> where<00:06:53.949> to<00:06:53.979> exactly<00:06:54.460> put<00:06:54.909> the<00:06:55.000> final<00:06:55.389> two

00:06:55.649 --> 00:06:55.659 
sure where to exactly put the final two

00:06:55.659 --> 00:06:58.920 
sure where to exactly put the final two
arm<00:06:56.969> yeah<00:06:57.969> so<00:06:58.120> I'm<00:06:58.180> interesting<00:06:58.719> what<00:06:58.900> you

00:06:58.920 --> 00:06:58.930 
arm yeah so I'm interesting what you

00:06:58.930 --> 00:07:01.589 
arm yeah so I'm interesting what you
think<00:06:59.289> about<00:06:59.319> the<00:06:59.500> final<00:06:59.800> two<00:07:00.240> this<00:07:01.240> is<00:07:01.389> the

00:07:01.589 --> 00:07:01.599 
think about the final two this is the
