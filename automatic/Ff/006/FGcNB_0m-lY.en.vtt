00:04:16.880 --> 00:04:16.890 
pockets are kind of deep so it's kind of

00:04:16.890 --> 00:04:18.710 
pockets are kind of deep so it's kind of
hard<00:04:17.070> to<00:04:17.130> carry<00:04:17.400> it<00:04:17.519> with<00:04:18.060> regular<00:04:18.239> two<00:04:18.510> chains

00:04:18.710 --> 00:04:18.720 
hard to carry it with regular two chains

00:04:18.720 --> 00:04:20.120 
hard to carry it with regular two chains
that'd<00:04:18.870> be<00:04:18.959> perfect

00:04:20.120 --> 00:04:20.130 
that'd be perfect

00:04:20.130 --> 00:04:24.620 
that'd be perfect
so<00:04:21.350> it's<00:04:22.350> also<00:04:22.640> $24.99<00:04:23.640> there's<00:04:24.330> one<00:04:24.450> of<00:04:24.510> those

00:04:24.620 --> 00:04:24.630 
so it's also $24.99 there's one of those

00:04:24.630 --> 00:04:27.320

so it allows you to carry things that
you<00:05:45.789> maybe<00:05:46.509> normally<00:05:46.990> wouldn't<00:05:47.379> carry<00:05:47.680> it

00:05:48.269 --> 00:05:48.279 
you maybe normally wouldn't carry it
