00:00:25.380 --> 00:00:26.759
 how this season 

00:00:26.759 --> 00:00:28.619
 We're going to give it to you guys. 

00:00:28.619 --> 00:00:33.100
 The top of the party on the 5th day of the list is a little bit for you that the process of 

00:00:33.100 --> 00:00:35.620
 make a report that shows the parties 

00:00:35.620 --> 00:00:39.790
 Who I really like Chávez has marques and I have an authentic 

00:00:39.790 --> 00:00:43.280
 well-being of my children or 

00:00:43.280 --> 00:00:44.750
 and when it does wrong 

00:00:44.750 --> 00:00:47.250
 many photos that reside here 

00:00:47.250 --> 00:00:50.300
 I hardly do it on time. 

00:00:50.300 --> 00:00:52.970
 on this page after this page 

00:00:52.970 --> 00:00:58.860
 - when the forces define the event is transmitted live according to agreement 

00:00:58.860 --> 00:01:03.140
 the presidential presence here the first page I did 

00:01:04.200 --> 00:01:07.100
 know here 

00:01:07.100 --> 00:01:10.150
 davi pereira coutinho from milan inter 

00:01:10.150 --> 00:01:12.439
 he even this peace here was 

00:01:12.439 --> 00:01:14.060
 it was a play of scale 

00:01:14.060 --> 00:01:17.130
 legault is the rumor that I participate 

00:01:17.130 --> 00:01:20.530
 whats a cool thing that wins come up challenged 

00:01:20.530 --> 00:01:25.430
 between blogs and websites or want to participate normally tries to take advantage 

00:01:25.430 --> 00:01:28.910
 and make another page valdecina and never ends 

00:01:28.910 --> 00:01:30.460
 on this site 

00:01:30.460 --> 00:01:34.620
 in hospitals such as fitch their inspirations rate do so too 

00:01:34.619 --> 00:01:37.619
 It's part of this something I did 

00:01:38.810 --> 00:01:41.130
 I eat the photons 

00:01:41.130 --> 00:01:43.890
 about 60 seconds to be sure 

00:01:43.890 --> 00:01:47.450
 it means that we hit many things that I did to put on the cover of the 

00:01:47.450 --> 00:01:48.120
 album 

00:01:48.120 --> 00:01:51.890
 pf report that have taken people talk that I do not really like to talk to 

00:01:51.890 --> 00:01:55.440
 true despite having misunderstandings 

00:01:55.440 --> 00:01:57.980
 You too can hear a lot. 

00:01:57.980 --> 00:01:59.400
 to create declared lin 

00:01:59.400 --> 00:02:02.400
 spider 

00:02:02.920 --> 00:02:07.450
 it is enough that the first part no opening part a match and was trapped 

00:02:07.450 --> 00:02:10.029
 had a car has a lot of that same beach 

00:02:10.029 --> 00:02:12.489
 all the time 

00:02:12.489 --> 00:02:16.049
 following her now has a face of hers 

00:02:16.049 --> 00:02:19.959
 do not know if there is any legal picture of the harmonization of 

00:02:19.959 --> 00:02:21.599
 put that in the beginning 

00:02:21.599 --> 00:02:25.689
 and after a hard and covered fault with little discernment explanation 

00:02:25.689 --> 00:02:27.959
 Why did you choose to have a 

00:02:27.959 --> 00:02:30.959
 how it was done on top of something interesting about it 

00:02:32.409 --> 00:02:36.489
 there is an invitation in the action to the jury fee that I took the 

00:02:36.489 --> 00:02:37.299
 invitation 

00:02:37.299 --> 00:02:41.689
 this is a modest thing mother does not account for all the southern parts fear 

00:02:41.689 --> 00:02:43.159
 which will elaborate 

00:02:43.159 --> 00:02:47.790
 I have a lot of embellishment in the text - embellishment sample took a lot to do 

00:02:47.790 --> 00:02:50.790
 changes - telling the story is important 

00:02:51.809 --> 00:02:54.189
 It's the one with a family photo too. 

00:02:54.189 --> 00:02:56.289
 only it will cost 

00:02:56.289 --> 00:03:00.429
 the lack of water had anticipated getting like fuegoio chose was in a phase 

00:03:00.429 --> 00:03:03.429
 always made small report the first movie 

00:03:05.119 --> 00:03:07.789
 is that you have a session property 

00:03:07.789 --> 00:03:08.750
 how it was 

00:03:08.750 --> 00:03:11.750
 in some matches that have only one beautiful photo 

00:03:12.280 --> 00:03:15.280
 who has some random adversary who despite not being a breakup 

00:03:16.079 --> 00:03:18.740
 do not have a story behind that the regatta do not 

00:03:18.740 --> 00:03:19.840
 and there are others who have 

00:03:19.840 --> 00:03:21.709
 but it seems to point 

00:03:21.709 --> 00:03:25.199
 twitter a photo of her doing brats I count little girls 

00:03:31.039 --> 00:03:34.129
 the PT recognized for families 

00:03:34.129 --> 00:03:37.860
 this kind of investigation that has not even been done on the island 

00:03:40.239 --> 00:03:43.570
 a match started open fact matters yes 

00:03:43.570 --> 00:03:44.599
 What we need 

00:03:44.599 --> 00:03:45.770
 me with her 

00:03:45.770 --> 00:03:49.570
 of my husband with her one of the businessmen most overlooked by the fact 

00:03:49.570 --> 00:03:51.889
 brothers 

00:03:51.889 --> 00:03:54.109
 this range of prudent 

00:03:54.109 --> 00:03:55.279
 has a role 

00:03:55.279 --> 00:03:57.209
 yesterday to cairo 

00:03:57.209 --> 00:04:00.479
 as I said in a conversation but can not do every afternoon 

00:04:00.479 --> 00:04:04.739
 elaborate and formal superstrap paper on things like this should take time. 

00:04:04.739 --> 00:04:05.659
 richer 

00:04:05.659 --> 00:04:08.579
 he has a relationship with the São Paulo team 

00:04:08.579 --> 00:04:11.579
 who was actually a brother 

00:04:12.109 --> 00:04:15.109
 I do not understand why many are on the waiting list. 

00:04:15.629 --> 00:04:19.269
 I'm too much to realize that everything will be under control 

00:04:19.269 --> 00:04:21.629
 how was the choice of attraction you drew 

00:04:21.629 --> 00:04:24.749
 I really like to study their reactions. 

00:04:24.749 --> 00:04:27.749
 things happen 

00:04:28.319 --> 00:04:31.669
 goes ahead in early May and September 

00:04:31.669 --> 00:04:34.009
 she was a wrong thing 

00:04:34.009 --> 00:04:35.710
 the team returns to the field 

00:04:35.710 --> 00:04:37.860
 but the systemic line 

00:04:37.860 --> 00:04:39.370
 in a challenging tone 

00:04:39.370 --> 00:04:42.029
 the blog 

00:04:42.029 --> 00:04:44.770
 is that they rate that they have nothing with paper 

00:04:44.770 --> 00:04:45.740
 the title 

00:04:45.740 --> 00:04:49.100
 and the faults ne not well decorated paper in the legal colors 

00:04:50.650 --> 00:04:52.949
 much more than that 

00:04:52.949 --> 00:04:56.219
 even with the head following the net defense 

00:04:56.219 --> 00:04:58.719
 that they were at the beginning 

00:04:58.719 --> 00:05:02.589
 is fact stirs the site of the most reinforced heart fadurpe 

00:05:03.169 --> 00:05:06.930
 the jokes of the attraction for those who are naughty to think about it 

00:05:06.930 --> 00:05:08.669
 background display 

00:05:08.669 --> 00:05:10.530
 on something about import 

00:05:10.530 --> 00:05:12.059
 the fifth title 

00:05:12.059 --> 00:05:14.360
 understand as usual 

00:05:14.360 --> 00:05:17.360
 have a slice a little of us asking 

00:05:18.759 --> 00:05:21.240
 but of the Palestinians 

00:05:21.240 --> 00:05:24.240
 small souvenirs 

00:05:24.789 --> 00:05:27.969
 it is due to the fact that the family we took 

00:05:27.969 --> 00:05:30.029
 although I like faults more 

00:05:30.029 --> 00:05:33.679
 overcoming these phases of jerzy buzek is also more serious than that 

00:05:33.679 --> 00:05:36.589
 knows all 

00:05:36.589 --> 00:05:39.759
 here also her neighbor 

00:05:39.759 --> 00:05:43.710
 and this last match here however the challenge of the litigation 

00:05:43.710 --> 00:05:46.960
 but if it was a page like this to finish 

00:05:46.960 --> 00:05:51.220
 so you can see if it tries all of the page styles 

00:05:51.779 --> 00:05:54.210
 Cynthia is leaving here. 

00:05:54.210 --> 00:05:55.369
 anyway 

00:05:55.369 --> 00:05:59.149
 and base price doing classes following the question I think it would 

00:05:59.149 --> 00:06:02.229
 the impression that you did and everything started 

00:06:02.229 --> 00:06:05.400
 with a little more commitment and the end as they have the mix make a 

00:06:05.400 --> 00:06:07.939
 good to know everything even having to dosage 

00:06:07.939 --> 00:06:11.549
 collections of families may appear during the same document comic 

00:06:11.549 --> 00:06:13.809
 referred to being fired 

00:06:13.809 --> 00:06:14.740
 what's up 

00:06:14.740 --> 00:06:16.990
 I like to do so 

00:06:16.990 --> 00:06:20.659
 radiant with the latest rate at which the FPC if Europe is here 

00:06:20.659 --> 00:06:24.319
 for each Senate seat but it is true that the last one was one 

00:06:24.930 --> 00:06:28.309
 the first 

00:06:28.309 --> 00:06:29.599
 so that's it 

00:06:29.599 --> 00:06:32.119
 if this was the album 

00:06:32.119 --> 00:06:35.119
 I loved it, it's a player that's more important. 

00:06:36.499 --> 00:06:37.359
 Thank you for giving up.
