fifth way

00:04:36.510 --> 00:04:39.360 
fifth way
actually<00:04:37.510> let's<00:04:37.750> move<00:04:38.050> down<00:04:38.530> to<00:04:38.980> the<00:04:39.100> fifth

00:04:39.360 --> 00:04:39.370 
actually let's move down to the fifth

00:04:39.370 --> 00:04:43.100 
actually let's move down to the fifth
way<00:04:39.640> which<00:04:39.910> is<00:04:40.090> housing<00:04:40.660> right<00:04:41.620> now<00:04:41.970> the

occupancy of the beds is 100% which

00:04:46.480 --> 00:04:49.350 
occupancy of the beds is 100% which
means<00:04:46.780> we<00:04:46.930> don't<00:04:47.110> have<00:04:47.290> any<00:04:47.470> free<00:04:47.770> beds<00:04:48.150> so<00:04:49.150> we

means we don't have any free beds so we

00:04:49.360 --> 00:04:52.830
