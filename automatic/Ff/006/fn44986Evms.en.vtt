00:00:07.540 --> 00:00:07.550 
so this is the butterfly in dr. Pillai

00:00:07.550 --> 00:00:11.739 
so this is the butterfly in dr. Pillai
teach<00:00:07.760> me<00:00:07.969> and<00:00:08.690> today<00:00:08.960> I<00:00:08.990> will<00:00:09.230> teach<00:00:10.749> kids

00:00:11.739 --> 00:00:11.749 
teach me and today I will teach kids

00:00:11.749 --> 00:00:14.350 
teach me and today I will teach kids
about<00:00:11.959> how<00:00:12.740> to<00:00:12.799> do<00:00:13.309> paper<00:00:13.579> cutting<00:00:14.059> for<00:00:14.329> a

00:00:14.350 --> 00:00:14.360 
about how to do paper cutting for a

00:00:14.360 --> 00:00:18.010 
about how to do paper cutting for a
Chinese<00:00:14.629> butterfly<00:00:15.379> is<00:00:15.769> this<00:00:16.700> kind<00:00:17.000> of<00:00:17.180> style

00:00:18.010 --> 00:00:18.020 
Chinese butterfly is this kind of style

00:00:18.020 --> 00:00:19.960 
Chinese butterfly is this kind of style
it's<00:00:18.440> a<00:00:18.530> paper<00:00:19.130> cutting<00:00:19.520> is<00:00:19.670> a<00:00:19.700> very

00:00:19.960 --> 00:00:19.970 
it's a paper cutting is a very

00:00:19.970 --> 00:00:24.970 
it's a paper cutting is a very
traditional<00:00:20.240> Chinese<00:00:21.160> handicraft<00:00:22.160> and<00:00:23.980> so

00:00:24.970 --> 00:00:24.980 
traditional Chinese handicraft and so

00:00:24.980 --> 00:00:26.920 
traditional Chinese handicraft and so
what<00:00:25.280> you'd<00:00:25.460> need<00:00:25.580> to<00:00:25.640> do<00:00:25.850> first<00:00:26.090> is<00:00:26.330> to<00:00:26.660> get<00:00:26.870> a

00:00:26.920 --> 00:00:26.930 
what you'd need to do first is to get a

00:00:26.930 --> 00:00:29.620 
what you'd need to do first is to get a
paper<00:00:27.200> and<00:00:28.090> it<00:00:29.090> doesn't<00:00:29.330> matter<00:00:29.420> the<00:00:29.600> size

00:00:29.620 --> 00:00:29.630 
paper and it doesn't matter the size

00:00:29.630 --> 00:00:31.450 
paper and it doesn't matter the size
maybe<00:00:30.080> the<00:00:30.350> bigger<00:00:30.530> for<00:00:30.980> the<00:00:31.070> fruit<00:00:31.280> first

00:00:31.450 --> 00:00:31.460 
maybe the bigger for the fruit first

00:00:31.460 --> 00:00:33.580 
maybe the bigger for the fruit first
time<00:00:31.700> so<00:00:31.820> it's<00:00:31.910> easier<00:00:32.210> to<00:00:32.329> cut<00:00:32.509> and<00:00:32.750> fold<00:00:33.410> them

00:00:33.580 --> 00:00:33.590 
time so it's easier to cut and fold them

00:00:33.590 --> 00:00:36.730 
time so it's easier to cut and fold them
in<00:00:33.829> this<00:00:34.010> way<00:00:34.250> first<00:00:34.930> half<00:00:35.930> and<00:00:36.320> then<00:00:36.560> half

00:00:36.730 --> 00:00:36.740 
in this way first half and then half

00:00:36.740 --> 00:00:41.920 
in this way first half and then half
again<00:00:37.220> so<00:00:37.490> you<00:00:38.450> will<00:00:38.600> get<00:00:38.840> two<00:00:40.930> butterflies

00:00:41.920 --> 00:00:41.930 
again so you will get two butterflies

00:00:41.930 --> 00:00:44.260 
again so you will get two butterflies
have<00:00:42.170> to<00:00:42.290> finish<00:00:42.500> it<00:00:42.860> so<00:00:43.100> you<00:00:43.160> can<00:00:43.340> unfold<00:00:43.670> it

00:00:44.260 --> 00:00:44.270 
have to finish it so you can unfold it

00:00:44.270 --> 00:00:46.950 
have to finish it so you can unfold it
and<00:00:44.480> see<00:00:44.870> see<00:00:45.380> the<00:00:45.500> result<00:00:45.800> ok<00:00:46.400> let's<00:00:46.550> start

00:00:46.950 --> 00:00:46.960 
and see see the result ok let's start

00:00:46.960 --> 00:00:50.830 
and see see the result ok let's start
first<00:00:47.960> we<00:00:48.170> will<00:00:48.320> do<00:00:48.500> this<00:00:48.860> part<00:00:49.220> of<00:00:49.520> the<00:00:50.360> of<00:00:50.630> the

00:00:50.830 --> 00:00:50.840 
first we will do this part of the of the

00:00:50.840 --> 00:00:56.100 
first we will do this part of the of the
butterfly<00:00:51.320> and<00:00:53.530> start<00:00:54.530> where<00:00:54.980> the<00:00:55.280> paper<00:00:55.550> are

00:00:56.100 --> 00:00:56.110 
butterfly and start where the paper are

00:00:56.110 --> 00:00:58.360 
butterfly and start where the paper are
connect<00:00:57.110> with<00:00:57.320> each<00:00:57.350> other<00:00:57.680> instead<00:00:58.010> of<00:00:58.190> this

00:00:58.360 --> 00:00:58.370 
connect with each other instead of this

00:00:58.370 --> 00:01:01.180 
connect with each other instead of this
part<00:00:58.700> that's<00:00:58.940> very<00:00:59.120> important<00:00:59.690> and<00:01:00.190> so

00:01:01.180 --> 00:01:01.190 
part that's very important and so

00:01:01.190 --> 00:01:04.119 
part that's very important and so
one-third<00:01:02.030> of<00:01:02.270> the<00:01:02.480> place<00:01:02.840> and<00:01:03.260> you<00:01:03.890> cut<00:01:04.100> a

00:01:04.119 --> 00:01:04.129 
one-third of the place and you cut a

00:01:04.129 --> 00:01:11.620 
one-third of the place and you cut a
nice<00:01:04.369> curve<00:01:07.000> and<00:01:08.000> then<00:01:08.299> follow<00:01:08.840> this<00:01:09.110> line<00:01:10.630> so

00:01:11.620 --> 00:01:11.630 
nice curve and then follow this line so

00:01:11.630 --> 00:01:14.860 
nice curve and then follow this line so
that<00:01:11.659> you<00:01:12.049> have<00:01:12.229> this<00:01:12.409> antenna<00:01:13.280> of<00:01:13.700> the<00:01:13.970> of<00:01:14.570> the

00:01:14.860 --> 00:01:14.870 
that you have this antenna of the of the

00:01:14.870 --> 00:01:17.890 
that you have this antenna of the of the
butterfly<00:01:15.610> but<00:01:16.610> don't<00:01:16.850> break<00:01:17.030> it<00:01:17.360> and<00:01:17.540> stop

00:01:17.890 --> 00:01:17.900 
butterfly but don't break it and stop

00:01:17.900 --> 00:01:22.270 
butterfly but don't break it and stop
right<00:01:18.170> here<00:01:18.590> and<00:01:19.180> now<00:01:20.560> we<00:01:21.560> cut<00:01:21.770> the<00:01:21.950> little

00:01:22.270 --> 00:01:22.280 
right here and now we cut the little

00:01:22.280 --> 00:01:26.530 
right here and now we cut the little
eyes<00:01:22.520> of<00:01:23.350> the<00:01:24.350> butterfly<00:01:25.150> they<00:01:26.150> are<00:01:26.270> round

00:01:26.530 --> 00:01:26.540 
eyes of the butterfly they are round

00:01:26.540 --> 00:01:31.840 
eyes of the butterfly they are round
shaped<00:01:29.500> and<00:01:30.500> here<00:01:30.680> comes<00:01:30.890> the<00:01:31.010> body<00:01:31.220> and<00:01:31.640> they

00:01:31.840 --> 00:01:31.850 
shaped and here comes the body and they

00:01:31.850 --> 00:01:36.280 
shaped and here comes the body and they
don't<00:01:32.060> it<00:01:32.560> so<00:01:33.560> you<00:01:33.710> can<00:01:33.920> see<00:01:34.930> here<00:01:35.930> is<00:01:36.110> the

00:01:36.280 --> 00:01:36.290 
don't it so you can see here is the

00:01:36.290 --> 00:01:38.350 
don't it so you can see here is the
whole<00:01:36.500> head<00:01:36.830> part<00:01:37.159> of<00:01:37.400> the<00:01:37.640> butterfly<00:01:37.820> which

00:01:38.350 --> 00:01:38.360 
whole head part of the butterfly which

00:01:38.360 --> 00:01:40.570 
whole head part of the butterfly which
is<00:01:38.479> already<00:01:38.659> out<00:01:38.869> and<00:01:39.110> though<00:01:39.920> there's<00:01:40.280> one

00:01:40.570 --> 00:01:40.580 
is already out and though there's one

00:01:40.580 --> 00:01:42.880 
is already out and though there's one
little<00:01:40.939> secret<00:01:41.270> for<00:01:41.659> paper<00:01:41.840> cutting<00:01:42.320> is<00:01:42.560> when

00:01:42.880 --> 00:01:42.890 
little secret for paper cutting is when

00:01:42.890 --> 00:01:46.390 
little secret for paper cutting is when
you<00:01:43.340> are<00:01:43.430> doing<00:01:43.460> it<00:01:43.880> the<00:01:44.659> part<00:01:45.040> you<00:01:46.040> shouldn't

00:01:46.390 --> 00:01:46.400 
you are doing it the part you shouldn't

00:01:46.400 --> 00:01:48.219 
you are doing it the part you shouldn't
turn<00:01:46.580> your<00:01:46.909> right<00:01:47.090> hand<00:01:47.390> which<00:01:47.630> is<00:01:47.659> handing

00:01:48.219 --> 00:01:48.229 
turn your right hand which is handing

00:01:48.229 --> 00:01:51.580 
turn your right hand which is handing
which<00:01:48.979> is<00:01:49.159> holding<00:01:49.580> the<00:01:49.790> scissor<00:01:50.600> but<00:01:51.350> only

00:01:51.580 --> 00:01:51.590 
which is holding the scissor but only

00:01:51.590 --> 00:01:54.280 
which is holding the scissor but only
your<00:01:51.920> left<00:01:52.100> hand<00:01:52.490> should<00:01:52.880> turn<00:01:53.259> which<00:01:54.259> is

00:01:54.280 --> 00:01:54.290 
your left hand should turn which is

00:01:54.290 --> 00:01:56.170 
your left hand should turn which is
holding<00:01:54.740> the<00:01:54.799> paper<00:01:55.009> it<00:01:55.340> will<00:01:55.490> make<00:01:55.700> it<00:01:56.000> the

00:01:56.170 --> 00:01:56.180 
holding the paper it will make it the

00:01:56.180 --> 00:01:58.719 
holding the paper it will make it the
work<00:01:56.330> little<00:01:56.570> bit<00:01:56.720> easier<00:01:57.220> so<00:01:58.220> now<00:01:58.430> we<00:01:58.490> will

00:01:58.719 --> 00:01:58.729 
work little bit easier so now we will

00:01:58.729 --> 00:02:04.649 
work little bit easier so now we will
cut<00:01:58.880> the<00:01:59.000> wing<00:01:59.180> which<00:01:59.479> is<00:01:59.509> a<00:01:59.780> big<00:02:00.340> round<00:02:01.340> circle

00:02:04.649 --> 00:02:04.659 

00:02:04.659 --> 00:02:07.300 

so<00:02:05.659> this<00:02:05.780> is<00:02:05.930> the<00:02:06.020> upper<00:02:06.320> side<00:02:06.500> of<00:02:06.530> the<00:02:06.829> of<00:02:07.100> the

00:02:07.300 --> 00:02:07.310 
so this is the upper side of the of the

00:02:07.310 --> 00:02:12.820 
so this is the upper side of the of the
wing<00:02:07.899> which<00:02:08.899> is<00:02:09.259> this<00:02:10.159> side<00:02:10.519> of<00:02:11.380> the<00:02:12.380> of<00:02:12.680> the

00:02:12.820 --> 00:02:12.830 
wing which is this side of the of the

00:02:12.830 --> 00:02:16.290 
wing which is this side of the of the
wing<00:02:13.239> now<00:02:14.239> it<00:02:14.420> comes<00:02:14.660> to<00:02:14.810> the

00:02:16.290 --> 00:02:16.300 
wing now it comes to the

00:02:16.300 --> 00:02:19.960 
wing now it comes to the
lower<00:02:17.300> part<00:02:17.750> of<00:02:17.989> the<00:02:18.230> body<00:02:18.470> which<00:02:19.459> is<00:02:19.489> another

00:02:19.960 --> 00:02:19.970 
lower part of the body which is another

00:02:19.970 --> 00:02:26.020 
lower part of the body which is another
part<00:02:20.299> of<00:02:21.580> a<00:02:22.580> round<00:02:22.819> circle<00:02:24.250> so<00:02:25.250> still<00:02:25.849> don't

00:02:26.020 --> 00:02:26.030 
part of a round circle so still don't

00:02:26.030 --> 00:02:27.460 
part of a round circle so still don't
break<00:02:26.209> it<00:02:26.450> because<00:02:26.599> we<00:02:26.900> still<00:02:26.959> have<00:02:27.200> a<00:02:27.230> little

00:02:27.460 --> 00:02:27.470 
break it because we still have a little

00:02:27.470 --> 00:02:31.330 
break it because we still have a little
little<00:02:27.920> little<00:02:28.220> tail<00:02:28.670> to<00:02:28.909> add<00:02:29.349> which<00:02:30.349> is<00:02:30.379> like

00:02:31.330 --> 00:02:31.340 
little little tail to add which is like

00:02:31.340 --> 00:02:34.270 
little little tail to add which is like
this<00:02:31.900> so<00:02:32.900> now<00:02:33.049> you<00:02:33.110> have<00:02:33.379> the<00:02:33.530> whole<00:02:33.739> outline

00:02:34.270 --> 00:02:34.280 
this so now you have the whole outline

00:02:34.280 --> 00:02:37.240 
this so now you have the whole outline
of<00:02:34.310> the<00:02:34.790> butterfly<00:02:35.390> finished<00:02:35.840> and<00:02:36.110> if<00:02:37.040> you

00:02:37.240 --> 00:02:37.250 
of the butterfly finished and if you

00:02:37.250 --> 00:02:40.000 
of the butterfly finished and if you
open<00:02:37.640> it<00:02:37.819> you<00:02:38.090> already<00:02:38.840> see<00:02:39.200> a<00:02:39.230> nice<00:02:39.530> butterfly

00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:40.010 
open it you already see a nice butterfly

00:02:40.010 --> 00:02:41.009 
open it you already see a nice butterfly
yeah

00:02:41.009 --> 00:02:41.019 
yeah

00:02:41.019 --> 00:02:44.890 
yeah
finished<00:02:42.220> but<00:02:43.220> you<00:02:43.519> still<00:02:43.970> have<00:02:44.120> some<00:02:44.150> small

00:02:44.890 --> 00:02:44.900 
finished but you still have some small

00:02:44.900 --> 00:02:47.050 
finished but you still have some small
work<00:02:45.110> to<00:02:45.290> do<00:02:45.440> for<00:02:45.650> insights<00:02:46.159> to<00:02:46.579> add<00:02:46.730> a<00:02:46.760> little

00:02:47.050 --> 00:02:47.060 
work to do for insights to add a little

00:02:47.060 --> 00:02:49.869 
work to do for insights to add a little
bit<00:02:47.299> more<00:02:47.569> directly<00:02:48.049> to<00:02:48.440> the<00:02:48.530> work<00:02:48.739> so<00:02:49.579> we<00:02:49.730> will

00:02:49.869 --> 00:02:49.879 
bit more directly to the work so we will

00:02:49.879 --> 00:02:52.420 
bit more directly to the work so we will
cut<00:02:50.090> now<00:02:50.299> this<00:02:50.750> part<00:02:51.079> in<00:02:51.319> sides<00:02:51.620> first<00:02:52.129> and

00:02:52.420 --> 00:02:52.430 
cut now this part in sides first and

00:02:52.430 --> 00:02:56.319 
cut now this part in sides first and
then<00:02:52.790> this<00:02:53.150> small<00:02:53.540> part<00:02:53.980> beneath<00:02:54.980> it<00:02:55.220> and<00:02:55.459> then

00:02:56.319 --> 00:02:56.329 
then this small part beneath it and then

00:02:56.329 --> 00:02:59.559 
then this small part beneath it and then
the<00:02:56.900> latest<00:02:57.319> part<00:02:57.530> will<00:02:57.829> be<00:02:57.980> the<00:02:58.329> main<00:02:59.329> body

00:02:59.559 --> 00:02:59.569 
the latest part will be the main body

00:02:59.569 --> 00:03:04.089 
the latest part will be the main body
part<00:02:59.930> of<00:03:00.079> the<00:03:00.319> butterfly<00:03:00.819> so<00:03:02.410> if<00:03:03.410> you<00:03:03.920> take<00:03:04.040> a

00:03:04.089 --> 00:03:04.099 
part of the butterfly so if you take a

00:03:04.099 --> 00:03:06.789 
part of the butterfly so if you take a
look<00:03:04.280> at<00:03:04.430> paper<00:03:04.670> cuts<00:03:05.109> you<00:03:06.109> will<00:03:06.290> wonder<00:03:06.470> where

00:03:06.789 --> 00:03:06.799 
look at paper cuts you will wonder where

00:03:06.799 --> 00:03:09.699 
look at paper cuts you will wonder where
you<00:03:07.010> you<00:03:07.519> can<00:03:07.549> get<00:03:07.819> a<00:03:07.879> shape<00:03:08.180> inside<00:03:08.750> then<00:03:09.680> the

00:03:09.699 --> 00:03:09.709 
you you can get a shape inside then the

00:03:09.709 --> 00:03:11.380 
you you can get a shape inside then the
secret<00:03:10.069> is<00:03:10.220> very<00:03:10.370> easy<00:03:10.609> you<00:03:10.760> just<00:03:10.819> cut<00:03:11.180> from

00:03:11.380 --> 00:03:11.390 
secret is very easy you just cut from

00:03:11.390 --> 00:03:14.020 
secret is very easy you just cut from
outside<00:03:11.780> in<00:03:12.019> and<00:03:12.650> then<00:03:13.129> you<00:03:13.220> get<00:03:13.400> your<00:03:13.640> way<00:03:13.760> in

00:03:14.020 --> 00:03:14.030 
outside in and then you get your way in

00:03:14.030 --> 00:03:19.479 
outside in and then you get your way in
so<00:03:14.329> like<00:03:14.569> this<00:03:14.810> and<00:03:17.890> here<00:03:18.890> you<00:03:19.010> go<00:03:19.160> have<00:03:19.340> the

00:03:19.479 --> 00:03:19.489 
so like this and here you go have the

00:03:19.489 --> 00:03:23.830 
so like this and here you go have the
first<00:03:19.819> part<00:03:20.180> and<00:03:21.169> I<00:03:21.290> just<00:03:21.500> turn<00:03:21.709> around<00:03:22.840> to

00:03:23.830 --> 00:03:23.840 
first part and I just turn around to

00:03:23.840 --> 00:03:28.780 
first part and I just turn around to
have<00:03:23.930> the<00:03:23.959> second<00:03:24.590> leaf

00:03:28.780 --> 00:03:28.790 

00:03:28.790 --> 00:03:37.340 

and<00:03:29.790> the<00:03:29.909> third<00:03:30.150> one

00:03:37.340 --> 00:03:37.350 

00:03:37.350 --> 00:03:44.400 

so

00:03:44.400 --> 00:03:44.410 

00:03:44.410 --> 00:03:47.729 

so

00:03:47.729 --> 00:03:47.739 

00:03:47.739 --> 00:03:51.759 

that's<00:03:48.739> the<00:03:48.950> upper<00:03:49.220> body<00:03:49.430> and<00:03:49.760> then<00:03:50.560> we<00:03:51.560> will

00:03:51.759 --> 00:03:51.769 
that's the upper body and then we will

00:03:51.769 --> 00:03:54.850 
that's the upper body and then we will
do<00:03:52.370> the<00:03:52.549> lower<00:03:53.120> one<00:03:53.450> which<00:03:54.170> is<00:03:54.379> a<00:03:54.409> little<00:03:54.769> bit

00:03:54.850 --> 00:03:54.860 
do the lower one which is a little bit

00:03:54.860 --> 00:03:57.460 
do the lower one which is a little bit
more<00:03:55.040> difficult<00:03:55.640> but<00:03:55.819> I'm<00:03:55.970> sure<00:03:56.239> if<00:03:56.450> you<00:03:56.720> take

00:03:57.460 --> 00:03:57.470 
more difficult but I'm sure if you take

00:03:57.470 --> 00:03:59.619 
more difficult but I'm sure if you take
the<00:03:57.620> time<00:03:57.830> and<00:03:58.190> be<00:03:58.640> careful<00:03:59.120> you'll<00:03:59.390> be<00:03:59.540> able

00:03:59.619 --> 00:03:59.629 
the time and be careful you'll be able

00:03:59.629 --> 00:04:04.630 
the time and be careful you'll be able
to<00:03:59.840> finish<00:03:59.989> it<00:04:00.140> so<00:04:00.950> you<00:04:01.010> also<00:04:01.930> cut<00:04:03.400> along<00:04:04.400> the

00:04:04.630 --> 00:04:04.640 
to finish it so you also cut along the

00:04:04.640 --> 00:04:10.899 
to finish it so you also cut along the
outline<00:04:07.299> like<00:04:08.299> this<00:04:09.310> and<00:04:10.310> then<00:04:10.489> you<00:04:10.640> need<00:04:10.790> to

00:04:10.899 --> 00:04:10.909 
outline like this and then you need to

00:04:10.909 --> 00:04:14.140 
outline like this and then you need to
do<00:04:11.090> the<00:04:11.470> small<00:04:12.470> delicate<00:04:12.860> working<00:04:13.430> site<00:04:13.730> which

00:04:14.140 --> 00:04:14.150 
do the small delicate working site which

00:04:14.150 --> 00:04:20.379 
do the small delicate working site which
is<00:04:14.360> down<00:04:14.989> in<00:04:15.019> this<00:04:15.379> way<00:04:16.540> this<00:04:17.540> is<00:04:17.690> one<00:04:19.389> along

00:04:20.379 --> 00:04:20.389 
is down in this way this is one along

00:04:20.389 --> 00:04:32.680 
is down in this way this is one along
the<00:04:20.600> line

00:04:32.680 --> 00:04:32.690 

00:04:32.690 --> 00:04:38.900 

so<00:04:34.039> then<00:04:35.039> you<00:04:35.160> see<00:04:35.340> the<00:04:35.490> the<00:04:35.880> part<00:04:36.150> which<00:04:36.750> is<00:04:37.910> in

00:04:38.900 --> 00:04:38.910 
so then you see the the part which is in

00:04:38.910 --> 00:04:40.879 
so then you see the the part which is in
the<00:04:39.060> lower<00:04:39.240> side<00:04:39.509> of<00:04:39.570> the<00:04:39.780> Ring<00:04:39.960> okay<00:04:40.560> now<00:04:40.710> let

00:04:40.879 --> 00:04:40.889 
the lower side of the Ring okay now let

00:04:40.889 --> 00:04:48.950 
the lower side of the Ring okay now let
comes<00:04:41.130> the<00:04:41.370> body<00:04:41.580> part<00:04:46.820> so<00:04:47.820> you<00:04:48.330> cut<00:04:48.570> along

00:04:48.950 --> 00:04:48.960 
comes the body part so you cut along

00:04:48.960 --> 00:04:51.590 
comes the body part so you cut along
this<00:04:49.259> a<00:04:49.650> little<00:04:50.070> bit<00:04:50.280> beneath<00:04:50.580> the<00:04:50.850> eye<00:04:51.030> the

00:04:51.590 --> 00:04:51.600 
this a little bit beneath the eye the

00:04:51.600 --> 00:04:55.490 
this a little bit beneath the eye the
first<00:04:51.630> upper<00:04:52.289> body<00:04:53.479> then<00:04:54.479> the<00:04:54.630> lower<00:04:54.810> body<00:04:55.169> in

00:04:55.490 --> 00:04:55.500 
first upper body then the lower body in

00:04:55.500 --> 00:04:59.029 
first upper body then the lower body in
this<00:04:55.620> kind<00:04:55.860> of<00:04:55.919> shape<00:04:57.050> and<00:04:58.050> then<00:04:58.710> in<00:04:58.919> the

00:04:59.029 --> 00:04:59.039 
this kind of shape and then in the

00:04:59.039 --> 00:05:05.990 
this kind of shape and then in the
middle<00:04:59.400> again<00:05:01.669> and<00:05:03.770> then<00:05:04.820> it's<00:05:05.820> almost

00:05:05.990 --> 00:05:06.000 
middle again and then it's almost

00:05:06.000 --> 00:05:08.480 
middle again and then it's almost
finished<00:05:06.300> the<00:05:07.050> result<00:05:07.410> is<00:05:07.620> if<00:05:07.889> you<00:05:08.039> open<00:05:08.400> the

00:05:08.480 --> 00:05:08.490 
finished the result is if you open the

00:05:08.490 --> 00:05:13.150 
finished the result is if you open the
paper<00:05:09.199> you<00:05:10.199> will<00:05:10.349> see<00:05:10.590> a<00:05:11.539> symmetrical

00:05:13.150 --> 00:05:13.160 
paper you will see a symmetrical

00:05:13.160 --> 00:05:18.650 
paper you will see a symmetrical
butterfly<00:05:14.160> a<00:05:14.460> bigger<00:05:14.789> one<00:05:15.060> version<00:05:15.539> now<00:05:17.660> so

00:05:18.650 --> 00:05:18.660 
butterfly a bigger one version now so

00:05:18.660 --> 00:05:25.650 
butterfly a bigger one version now so
it's<00:05:18.780> as<00:05:18.990> easy<00:05:19.320> as<00:05:19.560> that

00:05:25.650 --> 00:05:25.660 

00:05:25.660 --> 00:05:27.720 

you
