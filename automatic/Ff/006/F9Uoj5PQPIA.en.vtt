to fix whatever they needed to fix low
and<00:01:32.650> behold<00:01:32.770> they<00:01:33.070> find<00:01:33.310> out<00:01:33.490> the<00:01:33.940> whole<00:01:34.060> crew

00:01:34.320 --> 00:01:34.330 
and behold they find out the whole crew

00:01:34.330 --> 00:01:35.850 
and behold they find out the whole crew
has<00:01:34.510> been<00:01:34.540> destroyed<00:01:35.050> by<00:01:35.230> the<00:01:35.290> Necromorphs

00:01:35.850 --> 00:01:35.860 
has been destroyed by the Necromorphs

00:01:35.860 --> 00:01:39.090 
has been destroyed by the Necromorphs
but<00:01:36.640> unlike<00:01:37.120> the<00:01:37.300> army<00:01:37.660> or<00:01:37.870> other<00:01:38.050> soldiers<00:01:38.500> he

00:01:39.090 --> 00:01:39.100 
but unlike the army or other soldiers he

00:01:39.100 --> 00:01:41.160 
but unlike the army or other soldiers he
does<00:01:39.280> not<00:01:39.400> have<00:01:39.550> proper<00:01:39.730> weaponry<00:01:40.300> so<00:01:40.630> all<00:01:40.960> of

00:01:41.160 --> 00:01:41.170 
does not have proper weaponry so all of

00:01:41.170 --> 00:01:43.010 
does not have proper weaponry so all of
the<00:01:41.260> weapons<00:01:41.590> in<00:01:41.710> dead<00:01:41.860> space<00:01:42.100> are<00:01:42.340> basically

00:01:43.010 --> 00:01:43.020 
the weapons in dead space are basically

00:01:43.020 --> 00:01:46.710 
the weapons in dead space are basically
modified<00:01:44.020> construction<00:01:44.860> tools<00:01:45.070> so<00:01:46.030> his<00:01:46.540> main

00:01:46.710 --> 00:01:46.720 
modified construction tools so his main

00:01:46.720 --> 00:01:48.780 
modified construction tools so his main
gun<00:01:46.990> is<00:01:47.230> the<00:01:47.410> plasma<00:01:47.590> rifle<00:01:48.070> it<00:01:48.340> shoots<00:01:48.610> a

00:01:48.780 --> 00:01:48.790 
gun is the plasma rifle it shoots a

00:01:48.790 --> 00:01:50.910 
gun is the plasma rifle it shoots a
powerful<00:01:49.330> beam<00:01:49.480> that's<00:01:49.720> used<00:01:49.930> to<00:01:50.080> weld<00:01:50.290> and<00:01:50.680> do

00:01:50.910 --> 00:01:50.920 
powerful beam that's used to weld and do

00:01:50.920 --> 00:01:52.740 
powerful beam that's used to weld and do
something<00:01:51.250> like<00:01:51.280> that<00:01:51.400> so<00:01:51.580> instead<00:01:52.180> he<00:01:52.390> uses

00:01:52.740 --> 00:01:52.750 
something like that so instead he uses

00:01:52.750 --> 00:01:54.150 
something like that so instead he uses
that<00:01:52.870> against<00:01:53.260> the<00:01:53.350> Necromorphs<00:01:53.860> because

00:01:54.150 --> 00:01:54.160 
that against the Necromorphs because

00:01:54.160 --> 00:01:56.130 
that against the Necromorphs because
it's<00:01:54.310> one<00:01:54.430> of<00:01:54.520> the<00:01:54.580> only<00:01:54.760> weapons<00:01:55.060> he<00:01:55.150> has<00:01:55.330> so

00:01:56.130 --> 00:01:56.140 
it's one of the only weapons he has so

00:01:56.140 --> 00:01:57.690 
it's one of the only weapons he has so
throughout<00:01:56.530> the<00:01:56.770> game<00:01:56.950> you<00:01:57.250> discover<00:01:57.610> all

00:01:57.690 --> 00:01:57.700 
throughout the game you discover all

00:01:57.700 --> 00:01:59.580 
throughout the game you discover all
these<00:01:58.000> different<00:01:58.390> construction<00:01:58.900> tools<00:01:59.170> and

00:01:59.580 --> 00:01:59.590 
these different construction tools and

00:01:59.590 --> 00:02:01.530 
these different construction tools and
how<00:02:00.130> you<00:02:00.190> can<00:02:00.460> use<00:02:00.490> them<00:02:00.700> as<00:02:00.850> weapons<00:02:01.000> so<00:02:01.450> the

00:02:01.530 --> 00:02:01.540 
how you can use them as weapons so the

00:02:01.540 --> 00:02:02.730 
how you can use them as weapons so the
main<00:02:01.690> weapon<00:02:01.990> that<00:02:02.110> the<00:02:02.170> statute<00:02:02.500> comes<00:02:02.620> with

00:02:02.730 --> 00:02:02.740 
main weapon that the statute comes with

00:02:02.740 --> 00:02:04.380 
main weapon that the statute comes with
this<00:02:02.830> is<00:02:03.130> the<00:02:03.310> plasma<00:02:03.490> rifle<00:02:04.000> and<00:02:04.150> his

00:02:04.380 --> 00:02:04.390 
this is the plasma rifle and his

00:02:04.390 --> 00:02:07.020 
this is the plasma rifle and his
exclusive<00:02:05.020> is<00:02:05.230> the<00:02:05.710> Ripper<00:02:06.280> which<00:02:06.850> is

00:02:07.020 --> 00:02:07.030 
exclusive is the Ripper which is

00:02:07.030 --> 00:02:09.119 
exclusive is the Ripper which is
actually<00:02:07.510> another<00:02:08.200> construction<00:02:08.590> tool<00:02:08.890> and

00:02:09.119 --> 00:02:09.129 
actually another construction tool and

00:02:09.129 --> 00:02:11.760 
actually another construction tool and
it's<00:02:09.220> got<00:02:09.369> like<00:02:09.550> a<00:02:09.729> dual<00:02:10.060> blades<00:02:10.750> so<00:02:11.319> it<00:02:11.470> fires

00:02:11.760 --> 00:02:11.770 
it's got like a dual blades so it fires

00:02:11.770 --> 00:02:14.220 
it's got like a dual blades so it fires
spinning<00:02:12.580> blades<00:02:12.970> and<00:02:13.300> that<00:02:13.720> comes<00:02:13.930> in<00:02:14.050> handy

00:02:14.220 --> 00:02:14.230 
spinning blades and that comes in handy

00:02:14.230 --> 00:02:16.619 
spinning blades and that comes in handy
because<00:02:14.640> the<00:02:15.640> way<00:02:15.909> you<00:02:15.969> need<00:02:16.269> to<00:02:16.329> kill<00:02:16.510> the

00:02:16.619 --> 00:02:16.629 
because the way you need to kill the

00:02:16.629 --> 00:02:18.000 
because the way you need to kill the
Necromorphs<00:02:17.170> and<00:02:17.409> they<00:02:17.469> call<00:02:17.650> it<00:02:17.769> strategic

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:18.010 
Necromorphs and they call it strategic

00:02:18.010 --> 00:02:21.440 
Necromorphs and they call it strategic
dismemberment<00:02:18.969> and<00:02:19.060> so<00:02:19.750> you<00:02:19.810> have<00:02:20.109> to<00:02:20.290> cut<00:02:20.560> off

00:02:21.440 --> 00:02:21.450 
dismemberment and so you have to cut off

00:02:21.450 --> 00:02:23.690 
dismemberment and so you have to cut off
several<00:02:21.720> limbs<00:02:21.959> before<00:02:22.560> you<00:02:22.739> can<00:02:22.980> be<00:02:23.520> done

00:02:23.690 --> 00:02:23.700 
several limbs before you can be done

00:02:23.700 --> 00:02:25.280 
several limbs before you can be done
with<00:02:23.940> the<00:02:24.030> Necromorph<00:02:24.510> so<00:02:24.750> that's<00:02:25.020> why<00:02:25.230> the

00:02:25.280 --> 00:02:25.290 
with the Necromorph so that's why the

00:02:25.290 --> 00:02:26.780 
with the Necromorph so that's why the
Ripper<00:02:25.530> comes<00:02:25.800> in<00:02:25.920> really<00:02:26.069> handy<00:02:26.190> because<00:02:26.610> you

00:02:26.780 --> 00:02:26.790 
Ripper comes in really handy because you

00:02:26.790 --> 00:02:28.430 
Ripper comes in really handy because you
can<00:02:27.000> fire<00:02:27.180> the<00:02:27.360> blades<00:02:27.599> of<00:02:27.780> the<00:02:27.840> Necromorphs

00:02:28.430 --> 00:02:28.440 
can fire the blades of the Necromorphs

00:02:28.440 --> 00:02:30.259 
can fire the blades of the Necromorphs
and<00:02:28.590> chop<00:02:29.250> off<00:02:29.400> their<00:02:29.489> legs<00:02:29.670> chop<00:02:30.030> off<00:02:30.150> their

00:02:30.259 --> 00:02:30.269 
and chop off their legs chop off their

00:02:30.269 --> 00:02:31.610 
and chop off their legs chop off their
arms<00:02:30.540> whatever<00:02:30.720> you've<00:02:30.930> got<00:02:30.959> to<00:02:31.200> do<00:02:31.349> to<00:02:31.379> do

00:02:31.610 --> 00:02:31.620 
arms whatever you've got to do to do

00:02:31.620 --> 00:02:35.450 
arms whatever you've got to do to do
away<00:02:31.860> with<00:02:31.890> them<00:02:32.129> and<00:02:32.489> try<00:02:32.790> and<00:02:32.910> save<00:02:33.090> yourself
