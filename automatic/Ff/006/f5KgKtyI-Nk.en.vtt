 I invite you to stay to see its easy 

00:00:09.450 --> 00:00:13.289

00:00:15.719 --> 00:00:20.630
 which you will find in the description of 

00:00:17.430 --> 00:00:24.000
 video the materials to use are 

00:00:20.630 --> 00:00:25.610
 black white china paper and any 

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:30.660
 another color that is your preference 

00:00:25.610 --> 00:00:34.770
 plastic spike water balloon glue 

00:00:30.660 --> 00:00:36.120
 white brush small pencil scissors and 

00:00:34.770 --> 00:00:39.060
 ruler 

00:00:36.120 --> 00:00:42.710
 we begin we will initiate marking of a 

00:00:39.060 --> 00:00:49.219
 inch along the paper 

00:00:42.710 --> 00:00:51.980
 and already marked we will cut the ready strips 

00:00:49.219 --> 00:00:54.980
 the unfolding strips we will make each one and 

00:00:51.980 --> 00:00:57.980
 we will stack them and cut them 

00:00:54.980 --> 00:01:00.110
 again but now for the brands that 

00:00:57.980 --> 00:01:03.400
 they remained of the folds and will remain 

00:01:00.110 --> 00:01:06.040
 ready to continue 

00:01:03.400 --> 00:01:08.590
 now we will put white glue on a 

00:01:06.040 --> 00:01:11.100
 little water and mix very well with 

00:01:08.590 --> 00:01:11.100
 the brush 

00:01:11.110 --> 00:01:15.979
 ready the mix will be time to inflate 

00:01:13.939 --> 00:01:19.220
 the balloon and put the clip on 

00:01:15.979 --> 00:01:21.320
 plastic we will begin to apply the 

00:01:19.220 --> 00:01:24.170
 mix in the balloon and we will place 

00:01:21.320 --> 00:01:26.810
 the strips every time we place one or 

00:01:24.170 --> 00:01:30.080
 several we will apply the mixture covering 

00:01:26.810 --> 00:01:32.659
 you are doing very well and we will continue 

00:01:30.080 --> 00:01:34.799
 repeating this action in almost all the 

00:01:32.659 --> 00:01:37.720
 balloon 

00:01:34.799 --> 00:01:40.600
 remember to leave a part without covering already 

00:01:37.720 --> 00:01:44.799
 that this will be the hole of the candy store and 

00:01:40.600 --> 00:01:46.780
 let dry very well now 

00:01:44.799 --> 00:01:49.899
 we will make three circles of different 

00:01:46.780 --> 00:01:52.479
 sizes the white will be to cover the 

00:01:49.899 --> 00:01:55.360
 the blackner's hole will be for 

00:01:52.479 --> 00:01:57.670
 the pupil and the purple in my case will be 

00:01:55.360 --> 00:01:59.799
 for the irish you can use the color 

00:01:57.670 --> 00:02:03.390
 what else do you prefer and even make a 

00:01:59.799 --> 00:02:06.490
 more elaborate and great design like this one 

00:02:03.390 --> 00:02:08.500
 Once the piece is dry, we will remove the 

00:02:06.490 --> 00:02:11.110
 balloon the part where I placed the 

00:02:08.500 --> 00:02:14.799
 circles were not recorded but they are placed in 

00:02:11.110 --> 00:02:17.170
 the same way as the strips and you 

00:02:14.799 --> 00:02:19.690
 I will show another more instantaneous way and 

00:02:17.170 --> 00:02:22.150
 practice to place the circles with 

00:02:19.690 --> 00:02:24.100
 plastic or adhesive tape you can 

00:02:22.150 --> 00:02:26.799
 place them as you see here this 

00:02:24.100 --> 00:02:29.980
 second option personally is the most 

00:02:26.799 --> 00:02:33.980
 advisable ready that easy 

00:02:29.980 --> 00:02:38.060
 we will have these great eye candy 

00:02:33.980 --> 00:02:42.549
 now he only places sweet spiders and 

00:02:38.060 --> 00:02:42.549
 other things you want to give away 

00:02:46.230 --> 00:02:53.600
 finally we will cover the hole with the 

00:02:49.060 --> 00:02:56.210
 circle of white paper and it will be ready 

00:02:53.600 --> 00:02:58.700
 what did you think I hope that I have 

00:02:56.210 --> 00:03:01.340
 I really liked this idea and if so, 

00:02:58.700 --> 00:03:02.540
