so<00:01:19.170> this<00:01:19.499> is<00:01:19.799> an<00:01:20.159> AMD<00:01:21.049> 6970<00:01:22.049> graphics<00:01:22.770> card<00:01:23.039> it

00:01:23.569 --> 00:01:23.579 
so this is an AMD 6970 graphics card it

00:01:23.579 --> 00:01:26.209 
so this is an AMD 6970 graphics card it
is<00:01:24.390> one<00:01:24.569> of<00:01:24.600> the<00:01:24.719> first<00:01:24.869> revisions<00:01:25.469> what<00:01:26.100> I'm

00:01:26.209 --> 00:01:26.219

these tiny memory heat sinks from it

00:01:32.899 --> 00:01:36.740 
these tiny memory heat sinks from it
problem<00:01:33.899> is<00:01:34.049> this<00:01:34.560> stuff<00:01:35.179> permanent<00:01:36.179> thermal

graphics<00:01:54.390> cards<00:01:54.659> so<00:01:54.840> I<00:01:54.869> won't<00:01:55.170> want<00:01:55.590> to<00:01:55.679> have

00:01:55.819 --> 00:01:55.829 
graphics cards so I won't want to have

00:01:55.829 --> 00:01:57.529 
graphics cards so I won't want to have
to<00:01:55.950> buy<00:01:56.069> a<00:01:56.099> new<00:01:56.280> water<00:01:56.489> block<00:01:56.700> and<00:01:57.270> after

00:01:57.529 --> 00:01:57.539 
to buy a new water block and after

00:01:57.539 --> 00:01:59.809 
to buy a new water block and after
looking<00:01:57.780> at<00:01:57.899> several<00:01:58.049> water<00:01:58.379> blocks<00:01:58.619> most<00:01:59.610> of

00:01:59.809 --> 00:01:59.819 
looking at several water blocks most of

00:01:59.819 --> 00:02:01.580 
looking at several water blocks most of
them<00:01:59.939> are<00:02:00.060> low-profile<00:02:00.599> and<00:02:00.840> would<00:02:01.409> end<00:02:01.530> up

00:02:01.580 --> 00:02:01.590 
them are low-profile and would end up

00:02:01.590 --> 00:02:03.740 
them are low-profile and would end up
getting<00:02:01.860> in<00:02:01.950> the<00:02:02.039> way<00:02:02.189> of<00:02:02.789> the<00:02:02.969> RAM<00:02:03.119> sinks<00:02:03.509> up

00:02:03.740 --> 00:02:03.750 
getting in the way of the RAM sinks up

getting in the way of the RAM sinks up
top<00:02:04.079> here<00:02:04.379> so<00:02:04.560> I<00:02:05.219> have<00:02:05.369> to<00:02:05.459> ask<00:02:05.579> how<00:02:06.299> permanent

minutes to an hour some even said they

00:02:20.160 --> 00:02:21.740 
minutes to an hour some even said they
did<00:02:20.280> it<00:02:20.370> overnight<00:02:20.700> and<00:02:21.239> I<00:02:21.299> wasn't<00:02:21.510> willing<00:02:21.599> to

00:02:21.740 --> 00:02:21.750 
did it overnight and I wasn't willing to

00:02:21.750 --> 00:02:23.960 
did it overnight and I wasn't willing to
do<00:02:21.900> that<00:02:22.079> I<00:02:22.290> thought<00:02:23.040> well<00:02:23.579> a<00:02:23.609> can<00:02:23.849> of

00:02:23.960 --> 00:02:23.970 
do that I thought well a can of

00:02:23.970 --> 00:02:25.400 
do that I thought well a can of
compressed<00:02:24.060> air<00:02:24.450> would<00:02:24.599> be<00:02:24.660> cold<00:02:24.900> as<00:02:25.049> well<00:02:25.170> too

00:02:25.400 --> 00:02:25.410 
compressed air would be cold as well too

00:02:25.410 --> 00:02:26.800 
compressed air would be cold as well too
as<00:02:25.590> well

00:02:26.800 --> 00:02:26.810 
as well

00:02:26.810 --> 00:02:29.990 
as well
however<00:02:27.810> after<00:02:27.989> try<00:02:28.290> and<00:02:28.380> compressed<00:02:28.739> air<00:02:29.000> it

00:02:29.990 --> 00:02:30.000 
however after try and compressed air it

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:33.440 
however after try and compressed air it
did<00:02:30.239> not<00:02:30.389> prove<00:02:30.780> successful<00:02:31.170> without<00:02:32.160> them<00:02:32.450> at

00:02:33.440 --> 00:02:33.450 
did not prove successful without them at

00:02:33.450 --> 00:02:34.580 
did not prove successful without them at
least<00:02:33.630> I<00:02:33.690> didn't<00:02:33.900> want<00:02:34.049> to<00:02:34.169> apply<00:02:34.349> a<00:02:34.380> lot<00:02:34.530> of

00:02:34.580 --> 00:02:34.590 
least I didn't want to apply a lot of

00:02:34.590 --> 00:02:36.740 
least I didn't want to apply a lot of
force<00:02:34.680> the<00:02:35.040> whole<00:02:35.160> idea<00:02:35.519> is<00:02:35.700> I<00:02:36.239> want<00:02:36.599> to<00:02:36.630> be

00:02:36.740 --> 00:02:36.750 
force the whole idea is I want to be

00:02:36.750 --> 00:02:38.089 
force the whole idea is I want to be
able<00:02:36.810> to<00:02:36.989> do<00:02:37.109> this<00:02:37.260> without<00:02:37.410> applying<00:02:37.769> a<00:02:37.980> lot

00:02:38.089 --> 00:02:38.099 
able to do this without applying a lot

00:02:38.099 --> 00:02:41.000 
able to do this without applying a lot
of<00:02:38.130> force<00:02:38.400> I<00:02:38.700> also<00:02:39.389> tried<00:02:39.750> this<00:02:40.440> thermal

00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:41.010 
of force I also tried this thermal

00:02:41.010 --> 00:02:43.339 
of force I also tried this thermal
material<00:02:41.190> remover<00:02:41.880> this<00:02:42.569> stuff<00:02:42.810> is<00:02:42.959> designed

00:02:43.339 --> 00:02:43.349 
material remover this stuff is designed

00:02:43.349 --> 00:02:45.289 
material remover this stuff is designed
to<00:02:43.530> only<00:02:43.650> remove<00:02:43.980> thermal<00:02:44.370> grease<00:02:44.579> but<00:02:45.269> I

00:02:45.289 --> 00:02:45.299 
to only remove thermal grease but I

00:02:45.299 --> 00:02:46.849 
to only remove thermal grease but I
figured<00:02:45.630> what<00:02:45.750> the<00:02:45.780> hell<00:02:46.019> I'll<00:02:46.500> give<00:02:46.620> it<00:02:46.650> a<00:02:46.739> try

00:02:46.849 --> 00:02:46.859 
figured what the hell I'll give it a try

00:02:46.859 --> 00:02:49.970 
figured what the hell I'll give it a try
that<00:02:47.190> did<00:02:47.370> not<00:02:47.489> work<00:02:47.669> either<00:02:48.380> so<00:02:49.380> now<00:02:49.709> instead

00:02:49.970 --> 00:02:49.980 
that did not work either so now instead

00:02:49.980 --> 00:02:52.280 
that did not work either so now instead
I<00:02:50.459> decided<00:02:51.269> I<00:02:51.419> would<00:02:51.480> try<00:02:51.750> instead<00:02:51.989> of<00:02:52.049> going

00:02:52.280 --> 00:02:52.290 
I decided I would try instead of going

00:02:52.290 --> 00:02:55.339 
I decided I would try instead of going
cold<00:02:52.500> I<00:02:52.799> would<00:02:52.950> go<00:02:53.160> heat<00:02:53.450> so<00:02:54.450> I<00:02:54.690> have<00:02:55.109> a<00:02:55.139> heat

00:02:55.339 --> 00:02:55.349 
cold I would go heat so I have a heat

00:02:55.349 --> 00:02:59.240 
cold I would go heat so I have a heat
gun<00:02:56.299> it's<00:02:57.299> uh<00:02:57.530> standard<00:02:58.530> arts<00:02:58.769> and<00:02:58.919> crafts

00:02:59.240 --> 00:02:59.250 
gun it's uh standard arts and crafts

00:02:59.250 --> 00:03:01.129 
gun it's uh standard arts and crafts
heat<00:02:59.639> gun<00:02:59.849> nothing<00:03:00.269> fancy<00:03:00.720> I<00:03:00.750> think<00:03:00.930> I<00:03:00.989> bought

00:03:01.129 --> 00:03:01.139 
heat gun nothing fancy I think I bought

00:03:01.139 --> 00:03:04.039 
heat gun nothing fancy I think I bought
it<00:03:01.200> for<00:03:01.290> 20<00:03:01.500> bucks<00:03:01.590> at<00:03:01.889> a<00:03:01.919> Menards<00:03:02.780> so<00:03:03.780> what<00:03:03.959> I'm

00:03:04.039 --> 00:03:04.049 
it for 20 bucks at a Menards so what I'm

00:03:04.049 --> 00:03:06.289 
it for 20 bucks at a Menards so what I'm
doing<00:03:04.079> is<00:03:05.010> I'm<00:03:05.310> successfully<00:03:05.849> removed<00:03:06.120> these

doing is I'm successfully removed these

00:03:06.299 --> 00:03:08.180 
doing is I'm successfully removed these
three<00:03:06.690> now<00:03:07.319> obviously<00:03:07.680> I'm<00:03:07.829> trying<00:03:07.950> to<00:03:08.099> be

00:03:12.770 --> 00:03:12.780 
take the RAM off as well I have no idea

00:03:12.780 --> 00:03:14.240 
take the RAM off as well I have no idea
how<00:03:12.959> well<00:03:13.139> they're<00:03:13.349> attached<00:03:13.650> I'm<00:03:13.889> gonna<00:03:14.040> err

00:03:14.240 --> 00:03:14.250 
how well they're attached I'm gonna err

00:03:14.250 --> 00:03:15.680 
how well they're attached I'm gonna err

very securely attached to the board so

00:03:19.230 --> 00:03:21.979 
very securely attached to the board so
I'm<00:03:19.470> gonna<00:03:19.829> heat<00:03:20.040> up<00:03:20.190> this<00:03:20.340> round<00:03:20.549> sink<00:03:20.989> then

00:03:21.979 --> 00:03:21.989 
I'm gonna heat up this round sink then

00:03:21.989 --> 00:03:23.990 
I'm gonna heat up this round sink then
I'm<00:03:22.049> gonna<00:03:22.200> take<00:03:22.349> this<00:03:22.440> exacto<00:03:22.980> knife<00:03:23.160> and<00:03:23.489> I'm

00:03:23.990 --> 00:03:24.000 
I'm gonna take this exacto knife and I'm

00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:26.539 
I'm gonna take this exacto knife and I'm
gonna<00:03:24.120> try<00:03:24.359> and<00:03:24.419> very<00:03:24.690> carefully<00:03:25.230> slide<00:03:25.500> it<00:03:25.680> in

00:03:26.539 --> 00:03:26.549 
gonna try and very carefully slide it in

00:03:26.549 --> 00:03:28.960 
gonna try and very carefully slide it in
between<00:03:26.759> the<00:03:27.359> RAM<00:03:27.959> and

00:03:28.960 --> 00:03:28.970 
between the RAM and

00:03:28.970 --> 00:03:31.150 
between the RAM and
I'm<00:03:29.420> gonna<00:03:29.510> try<00:03:29.780> and<00:03:29.840> bury<00:03:30.500> it<00:03:30.680> into<00:03:30.950> the

00:03:31.150 --> 00:03:31.160 
I'm gonna try and bury it into the

00:03:31.160 --> 00:03:32.800 
I'm gonna try and bury it into the
thermal<00:03:31.970> light<00:03:32.090> he<00:03:32.240> says<00:03:32.390> now<00:03:32.570> the<00:03:32.630> thermal

00:03:32.800 --> 00:03:32.810 
thermal light he says now the thermal

00:03:32.810 --> 00:03:35.950 
thermal light he says now the thermal
adhesive<00:03:32.990> is<00:03:33.350> an<00:03:33.440> epoxy<00:03:33.740> okay<00:03:34.610> ceramic<00:03:35.540> it's<00:03:35.690> a

00:03:35.950 --> 00:03:35.960 
adhesive is an epoxy okay ceramic it's a

00:03:35.960 --> 00:03:38.110 
adhesive is an epoxy okay ceramic it's a
lot<00:03:36.470> like<00:03:36.650> the<00:03:36.800> stuff<00:03:37.070> that<00:03:37.250> you<00:03:37.370> would<00:03:37.580> use<00:03:37.790> to

00:03:38.110 --> 00:03:38.120 
lot like the stuff that you would use to

00:03:38.120 --> 00:03:42.580 
lot like the stuff that you would use to
combine<00:03:39.050> tile<00:03:39.560> or<00:03:40.220> a<00:03:40.280> seal<00:03:41.120> of<00:03:41.270> a<00:03:41.360> bathtub<00:03:41.750> it's

00:03:42.580 --> 00:03:42.590 
combine tile or a seal of a bathtub it's

00:03:42.590 --> 00:03:43.990 
combine tile or a seal of a bathtub it's
not<00:03:42.710> exactly<00:03:43.040> the<00:03:43.190> same<00:03:43.370> it's<00:03:43.610> pretty<00:03:43.760> close

00:03:43.990 --> 00:03:44.000 
not exactly the same it's pretty close

00:03:44.000 --> 00:03:46.540 
not exactly the same it's pretty close
the<00:03:44.210> idea<00:03:44.450> is<00:03:44.660> once<00:03:45.200> it<00:03:45.380> gets<00:03:45.560> solid<00:03:46.010> it

00:03:46.540 --> 00:03:46.550 
the idea is once it gets solid it

00:03:46.550 --> 00:03:48.400 
the idea is once it gets solid it
doesn't<00:03:46.610> get<00:03:46.940> on<00:03:46.970> solid<00:03:47.240> so<00:03:47.570> by<00:03:47.690> eating<00:03:47.990> it<00:03:48.110> I'm

00:03:48.400 --> 00:03:48.410 
doesn't get on solid so by eating it I'm

00:03:48.410 --> 00:03:50.050 
doesn't get on solid so by eating it I'm
not<00:03:48.560> actually<00:03:48.770> gonna<00:03:49.040> make<00:03:49.250> it<00:03:49.400> jelly<00:03:49.730> again

00:03:50.050 --> 00:03:50.060 
not actually gonna make it jelly again

00:03:50.060 --> 00:03:52.420 
not actually gonna make it jelly again
I'm<00:03:50.780> basically<00:03:51.110> just<00:03:51.350> gonna<00:03:51.470> weaken<00:03:52.100> the<00:03:52.220> bond

00:03:52.420 --> 00:03:52.430 
I'm basically just gonna weaken the bond

00:03:52.430 --> 00:03:54.820 
I'm basically just gonna weaken the bond
now<00:03:53.270> what<00:03:53.450> happened<00:03:53.750> with<00:03:53.870> these<00:03:54.020> three<00:03:54.320> was

00:03:54.820 --> 00:03:54.830 
now what happened with these three was

00:03:54.830 --> 00:03:56.320 
now what happened with these three was
when<00:03:55.040> it<00:03:55.160> ended<00:03:55.400> up<00:03:55.520> popping<00:03:55.820> off<00:03:55.940> the<00:03:56.090> popped

00:03:56.320 --> 00:03:56.330 
when it ended up popping off the popped

00:03:56.330 --> 00:03:59.290 
when it ended up popping off the popped
up<00:03:56.510> immediately<00:03:57.410> and<00:03:58.370> it<00:03:58.550> did<00:03:58.670> not<00:03:58.760> turn<00:03:58.970> jelly

00:03:59.290 --> 00:03:59.300 
up immediately and it did not turn jelly

00:03:59.300 --> 00:04:03.670 
up immediately and it did not turn jelly
it's<00:03:59.930> just<00:04:00.200> a<00:04:00.290> solid<00:04:00.440> sheet<00:04:00.770> of<00:04:00.890> epoxy<00:04:01.630> so<00:04:02.680> I'm

00:04:03.670 --> 00:04:03.680 
it's just a solid sheet of epoxy so I'm

00:04:03.680 --> 00:04:05.560 
it's just a solid sheet of epoxy so I'm
gonna<00:04:03.860> heat<00:04:04.040> it<00:04:04.070> up<00:04:04.220> the<00:04:04.820> rim<00:04:05.000> sink<00:04:05.270> is<00:04:05.390> gonna

00:04:05.560 --> 00:04:05.570 
gonna heat it up the rim sink is gonna

00:04:05.570 --> 00:04:06.790 
gonna heat it up the rim sink is gonna
end<00:04:05.690> up<00:04:05.750> being<00:04:05.930> very<00:04:05.960> hot<00:04:06.530> to<00:04:06.680> the<00:04:06.710> touch

00:04:06.790 --> 00:04:06.800 
end up being very hot to the touch

00:04:06.800 --> 00:04:08.230 
end up being very hot to the touch
you're<00:04:07.130> not<00:04:07.220> gonna<00:04:07.310> be<00:04:07.430> able<00:04:07.490> to<00:04:07.580> hold<00:04:07.730> it<00:04:07.910> so

00:04:08.230 --> 00:04:08.240 
you're not gonna be able to hold it so

00:04:08.240 --> 00:04:09.280 
you're not gonna be able to hold it so
that's<00:04:08.390> why<00:04:08.540> I'm<00:04:08.630> gonna<00:04:08.780> do<00:04:08.900> this<00:04:09.020> with<00:04:09.170> the

00:04:09.280 --> 00:04:09.290 
that's why I'm gonna do this with the

00:04:09.290 --> 00:04:11.800 
that's why I'm gonna do this with the
exacto<00:04:09.650> knife<00:04:09.880> some<00:04:10.880> point<00:04:11.150> let's<00:04:11.480> give<00:04:11.690> it<00:04:11.720> a

00:04:11.800 --> 00:04:11.810 
exacto knife some point let's give it a

00:04:11.810 --> 00:04:13.000 
exacto knife some point let's give it a
shot<00:04:11.840> for<00:04:12.140> this<00:04:12.200> last<00:04:12.410> one<00:04:12.590> hopefully<00:04:12.890> I<00:04:12.920> can

00:04:13.000 --> 00:04:13.010 
shot for this last one hopefully I can

00:04:13.010 --> 00:04:14.560 
shot for this last one hopefully I can
get<00:04:13.190> it<00:04:13.280> successfully<00:04:13.730> done<00:04:13.880> with<00:04:14.480> the

00:04:14.560 --> 00:04:14.570 
get it successfully done with the

00:04:14.570 --> 00:04:15.100 
get it successfully done with the
recording

00:04:15.100 --> 00:04:15.110 
recording

00:04:15.110 --> 00:04:19.060 
recording
you're<00:04:15.770> gonna<00:04:15.890> need<00:04:17.620> I'm<00:04:18.620> gonna<00:04:18.769> heat<00:04:18.950> it<00:04:18.980> up

00:04:19.060 --> 00:04:19.070 
you're gonna need I'm gonna heat it up

00:04:19.070 --> 00:04:22.120 
you're gonna need I'm gonna heat it up
on<00:04:19.220> various<00:04:19.549> sides

00:04:22.120 --> 00:04:22.130 

00:04:22.130 --> 00:04:24.690 

with<00:04:22.640> these<00:04:22.730> other<00:04:22.940> three<00:04:23.210> it's<00:04:24.140> up<00:04:24.290> to<00:04:24.470> those

00:04:24.690 --> 00:04:24.700 
with these other three it's up to those

00:04:24.700 --> 00:04:27.360 
with these other three it's up to those
so<00:04:25.700> I'm<00:04:25.760> not<00:04:25.850> gonna<00:04:25.970> heat<00:04:26.150> it<00:04:26.240> for<00:04:26.330> very<00:04:26.510> long

00:04:27.360 --> 00:04:27.370 
so I'm not gonna heat it for very long

00:04:27.370 --> 00:04:30.640 
so I'm not gonna heat it for very long
give<00:04:28.370> it<00:04:28.460> a<00:04:28.490> few<00:04:28.610> seconds<00:04:29.380> Iran<00:04:30.380> is<00:04:30.470> gonna<00:04:30.590> be

00:04:30.640 --> 00:04:30.650 
give it a few seconds Iran is gonna be

00:04:30.650 --> 00:04:32.620 
give it a few seconds Iran is gonna be
very<00:04:30.740> hot<00:04:30.980> don't<00:04:31.220> touch<00:04:31.370> it<00:04:31.550> I'm<00:04:31.940> gonna<00:04:32.120> try

so weasel my exacto knife in between and

00:04:37.040 --> 00:04:39.490 
so weasel my exacto knife in between and
you're<00:04:37.220> gonna<00:04:37.430> apply<00:04:37.700> very<00:04:38.360> very<00:04:38.960> little

00:04:39.490 --> 00:04:39.500 
you're gonna apply very very little

00:04:39.500 --> 00:04:42.400 
you're gonna apply very very little
pressure<00:04:39.830> very<00:04:40.580> little<00:04:41.000> when<00:04:41.990> the<00:04:42.080> thermal

00:04:42.400 --> 00:04:42.410 
pressure very little when the thermal

00:04:42.410 --> 00:04:44.830 
pressure very little when the thermal
epoxy<00:04:42.860> is<00:04:43.310> ready<00:04:43.640> to<00:04:43.730> come<00:04:43.910> off<00:04:43.940> it<00:04:44.570> will<00:04:44.690> not

00:04:44.830 --> 00:04:44.840 
epoxy is ready to come off it will not

00:04:44.840 --> 00:04:46.720 
epoxy is ready to come off it will not
take<00:04:45.050> much<00:04:45.230> effort<00:04:45.380> when<00:04:46.280> it's<00:04:46.370> ready<00:04:46.550> it's
