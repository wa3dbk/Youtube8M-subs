00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.590
 the first start 

00:00:01.860 --> 00:00:07.350
 then team but they will not click 

00:00:04.590 --> 00:00:10.130
 we are going to click right and we talk to 

00:00:07.350 --> 00:00:10.130
 manage 

00:00:10.860 --> 00:00:17.420
 what are we going to do, let's find the id 

00:00:14.160 --> 00:00:18.920
 from our wifi card 

00:00:17.420 --> 00:00:21.910
 then let's go here 

00:00:18.920 --> 00:00:25.690
 device administrator 

00:00:21.910 --> 00:00:27.789
 ok you have to leave them like a 

00:00:25.690 --> 00:00:31.900
 triangular 

00:00:27.789 --> 00:00:33.850
 yellow with this symbolic 

00:00:31.900 --> 00:00:35.290
 that means that they will miss the 

00:00:33.850 --> 00:00:39.670
 driver makes me tell you 

00:00:35.290 --> 00:00:41.470
 network or internet driver the problem 

00:00:39.670 --> 00:00:43.840
 network 

00:00:41.470 --> 00:00:45.760
 ok and that trailer is network for example if 

00:00:43.840 --> 00:00:48.520
 here I said in this driver told me 

00:00:45.760 --> 00:00:50.410
 a yellow triangle says of the skin of 

00:00:48.520 --> 00:00:53.470
 network what we are going to do is click 

00:00:50.410 --> 00:00:58.100
 Right where we will give properties 

00:00:53.470 --> 00:01:01.579
 ok then let's go to details 

00:00:58.100 --> 00:01:03.920
 ok here what we have to do is the 

00:01:01.579 --> 00:01:07.570
 property we have to click here 

00:01:03.920 --> 00:01:11.170
 let's find the hardware driver 

00:01:07.570 --> 00:01:14.950
 ok this is the driver the link of your 

00:01:11.170 --> 00:01:17.770
 our network card what are we going to 

00:01:14.950 --> 00:01:21.250
 do is give you right click and we're going to 

00:01:17.770 --> 00:01:24.160
 give copy ok here do let him do not 

00:01:21.250 --> 00:01:26.140
 move let's go to the page to a 

00:01:24.160 --> 00:01:28.990
 page that leaves them below the 

00:01:26.140 --> 00:01:31.119
 description of the video ok and input this 

00:01:28.990 --> 00:01:34.850
 page here we will put it where it says 

00:01:31.119 --> 00:01:38.590
 enter and we will paste 

00:01:34.850 --> 00:01:38.590
 and let's put look 

00:01:42.409 --> 00:01:48.530
 ok as they see me I got several 

00:01:45.140 --> 00:01:50.780
 options if you have windows xp 64 

00:01:48.530 --> 00:01:54.259
 bits here if they have windows xp 32 bits 

00:01:50.780 --> 00:01:56.730
 if they have windows 2000 they have windows 

00:01:54.259 --> 00:02:01.650
 vista seven windows 

00:01:56.730 --> 00:02:03.930
 according to whether they have 32 bits and 64 bits or not 

00:02:01.650 --> 00:02:06.630
 they know what they have to do that start 

00:02:03.930 --> 00:02:09.869
 and the teams and then right click and 

00:02:06.630 --> 00:02:12.870
 then properties ok let's slide the 

00:02:09.869 --> 00:02:13.320
 bar here says 64 operating system 

00:02:12.870 --> 00:02:14.960
 bits 

00:02:13.320 --> 00:02:18.180
 then the unit is 64 bits 

00:02:14.960 --> 00:02:21.220
 then I would give it here 

00:02:18.180 --> 00:02:24.490
 windows vista or 2008 

00:02:21.220 --> 00:02:27.130
 64 if it were 32 bits we would give it here 

00:02:24.490 --> 00:02:29.090
 in windows 2008 view where it says no more 

00:02:27.130 --> 00:02:31.310
 nothing 

00:02:29.090 --> 00:02:34.069
 then eat here something that I'm going to 

00:02:31.310 --> 00:02:37.090
 leave then 

00:02:34.069 --> 00:02:37.090
 here what we are going to do 

00:02:37.240 --> 00:02:42.490
 these are the driver versions 

00:02:39.570 --> 00:02:46.210
 this list is the newest 

00:02:42.490 --> 00:02:47.800
 the 47 and then the 45th account of the old 

00:02:46.210 --> 00:02:50.530
 hilarious passed to tip juane 3 

00:02:47.800 --> 00:02:52.300
 you guys if you want to install whatever 

00:02:50.530 --> 00:02:55.420
 It does not matter but I recommend the most 

00:02:52.300 --> 00:02:59.610
 new obvious here then what are we going to 

00:02:55.420 --> 00:02:59.610
 do is click here on this disk 

00:03:02.590 --> 00:03:06.330
 ok here the data will not appear 

00:03:09.550 --> 00:03:14.980
 and here we will give you where they serve and 

00:03:12.700 --> 00:03:19.000
 this what your driver weighs 

00:03:14.980 --> 00:03:21.280
 in my company 467 kilobytes but let's 

00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:24.730
 give here a tell the name of your driver 

00:03:21.280 --> 00:03:27.000
 and what you say and here we will not please 

00:03:24.730 --> 00:03:27.000
 here 

00:03:33.400 --> 00:03:38.890
 ok ok then here another one appears 

00:03:36.640 --> 00:03:42.360
 information what we are going to do is 

00:03:38.890 --> 00:03:45.390
 where to put it 

00:03:42.360 --> 00:03:47.640
 and if you are going to download the driver for your 

00:03:45.390 --> 00:03:50.120
 wifi network card or wifi 

00:03:47.640 --> 00:03:54.620
 ok we are going to save you keep it 

00:03:50.120 --> 00:03:54.620
 and this page we do not have to do anything 

00:03:56.120 --> 00:04:00.620
 okay 

00:03:57.800 --> 00:04:02.350
 I saved it on the desk 

00:04:00.620 --> 00:04:03.940
 here is 

00:04:02.350 --> 00:04:07.360
 with the put here for you to see 

00:04:03.940 --> 00:04:10.440
 we're going to click right and we're going 

00:04:07.360 --> 00:04:10.440
 to extract here 

00:04:10.770 --> 00:04:18.299
 ok two folders will appear 

00:04:14.560 --> 00:04:18.299
 we go where to get drivers 

00:04:18.670 --> 00:04:26.380
 there are 64 86 bits like 64 l I have to 

00:04:23.530 --> 00:04:27.750
 clicking here and these are the data 

00:04:26.380 --> 00:04:30.720
 you 

00:04:27.750 --> 00:04:32.280
 driver go to the files that goes to 

00:04:30.720 --> 00:04:35.280
 need so that you can work 

00:04:32.280 --> 00:04:37.920
 network card ok as you can see here not 

00:04:35.280 --> 00:04:40.710
 it looks like an installation 

00:04:37.920 --> 00:04:44.780
 an installation file what we have 

00:04:40.710 --> 00:04:44.780
 what to do here pay close attention 

00:04:45.060 --> 00:04:51.290
 where we went right now let's go again 

00:04:47.940 --> 00:04:56.480
 so that they do not come down we're going to go home 

00:04:51.290 --> 00:04:56.480
 computer right click administer 

00:04:56.920 --> 00:05:03.889
 device manager and where 

00:05:00.460 --> 00:05:07.729
 come out your yellow little triangle 

00:05:03.889 --> 00:05:14.080
 say card or network card / we are going to 

00:05:07.729 --> 00:05:14.080
 give right click and properties ok 

00:05:15.650 --> 00:05:21.240
 then let's go to the controller 

00:05:18.960 --> 00:05:26.180
 to you at first the two seem 

00:05:21.240 --> 00:05:26.180
 update update the hardware 

00:05:26.390 --> 00:05:30.680
 or what he says but so update though 

00:05:28.940 --> 00:05:33.890
 at the beginning and then they put 

00:05:30.680 --> 00:05:36.830
 update if driver does not come out 

00:05:33.890 --> 00:05:38.630
 to put to update driver ok here 

00:05:36.830 --> 00:05:40.700
 what we have to do is a day that 

00:05:38.630 --> 00:05:44.930
 look for driver software in the 

00:05:40.700 --> 00:05:48.110
 team here click do not get examine 

00:05:44.930 --> 00:05:50.480
 let's find the 64-bit folder 

00:05:48.110 --> 00:05:54.250
 is the one with which we download the 

00:05:50.480 --> 00:05:54.250
 compressed we go to the desk 

00:05:55.249 --> 00:05:59.929
 what we unpack with these two 

00:05:57.049 --> 00:06:02.919
 let's go to the biggest and we will give in 

00:05:59.929 --> 00:06:02.919
 64 bits 

00:06:03.400 --> 00:06:09.639
 and we give him to accept and the next and his 

00:06:06.490 --> 00:06:12.820
 6a driver will automatically install not 

00:06:09.639 --> 00:06:16.419
 there's so doing nothing windows it installs it already 

00:06:12.820 --> 00:06:19.050
 is installed the restart restart 

00:06:16.419 --> 00:06:19.050
 forgive the team
