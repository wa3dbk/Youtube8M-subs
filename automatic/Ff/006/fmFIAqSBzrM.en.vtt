00:00:03.410 --> 00:00:07.529
 hello my name is Pauline I am 

00:00:05.640 --> 00:00:09.090
 organizer of the daily or home 

00:00:07.529 --> 00:00:11.490
 organizer and today I'm going to you 

00:00:09.090 --> 00:00:13.290
 learn how to sort your papers so the 

00:00:11.490 --> 00:00:14.700
 first step that often appears the 

00:00:13.290 --> 00:00:16.650
 more insurmountable but who is not 

00:00:14.700 --> 00:00:17.910
 at all is to group all the 

00:00:16.650 --> 00:00:20.160
 papers lying around whether it's in 

00:00:17.910 --> 00:00:22.170
 the entrance to the kitchen in the living room or 

00:00:20.160 --> 00:00:24.900
 office we make a pile of all 

00:00:22.170 --> 00:00:26.250
 papers to sort second step once 

00:00:24.900 --> 00:00:28.920
 that we made a stack of all his 

00:00:26.250 --> 00:00:31.140
 papers we will take them one by one and 

00:00:28.920 --> 00:00:34.050
 the stirrup in shirts on each 

00:00:31.140 --> 00:00:37.649
 shirt is indicated roughly with a 

00:00:34.050 --> 00:00:39.059
 marker the title of the shirt this is to 

00:00:37.649 --> 00:00:40.770
 to tell if it's bills if that 

00:00:39.059 --> 00:00:42.600
 regards the house if it works the 

00:00:40.770 --> 00:00:45.180
 car the apartment etc 

00:00:42.600 --> 00:00:47.430
 we note of course each cover what 

00:00:45.180 --> 00:00:50.100
 it's about and we're classifying in 

00:00:47.430 --> 00:00:52.469
 corresponding folders third step 

00:00:50.100 --> 00:00:54.210
 we will separate the current from what is 

00:00:52.469 --> 00:00:56.160
 archived for example the old records 

00:00:54.210 --> 00:00:57.480
 banking these things there are things 

00:00:56.160 --> 00:00:59.969
 that we can put aside so we do 

00:00:57.480 --> 00:01:02.250
 a stack with archived folders and 

00:00:59.969 --> 00:01:04.650
 a pile with the current folders so 

00:01:02.250 --> 00:01:06.570
 4th step for the files we 

00:01:04.650 --> 00:01:08.040
 have decided to archived the simplest 

00:01:06.570 --> 00:01:10.920
 is to use archive boxes of this 

00:01:08.040 --> 00:01:13.409
 type is so you put the records 

00:01:10.920 --> 00:01:15.180
 in well noted before what he 

00:01:13.409 --> 00:01:17.189
 is to find them otherwise it does not 

00:01:15.180 --> 00:01:18.780
 is useless and then it archived you in 

00:01:17.189 --> 00:01:22.080
 top of a closet at the cellar in the attic 

00:01:18.780 --> 00:01:22.590
 a place where you rarely go 5th 

00:01:22.080 --> 00:01:24.210
 step 

00:01:22.590 --> 00:01:26.130
 the current records then there all 

00:01:24.210 --> 00:01:28.650
 depends on your organization at home 

00:01:26.130 --> 00:01:30.240
 if you have suspended records if 

00:01:28.650 --> 00:01:33.060
 you have a cupboard or shelves 

00:01:30.240 --> 00:01:34.350
 you put them nearby to be able to 

00:01:33.060 --> 00:01:36.299
 use them daily 

00:01:34.350 --> 00:01:38.490
 the last little advice is especially 

00:01:36.299 --> 00:01:41.070
 not to be afraid to put it 

00:01:38.490 --> 00:01:42.450
 a little long but it allows to make a 

00:01:41.070 --> 00:01:43.619
 good sort in all we have and 

00:01:42.450 --> 00:01:45.899
 it's not that difficult 

00:01:43.619 --> 00:01:48.119
 here you know the method for 

00:01:45.899 --> 00:01:50.570
 sort your administrative documents and I 

00:01:48.119 --> 00:01:50.570
 thank you very much
