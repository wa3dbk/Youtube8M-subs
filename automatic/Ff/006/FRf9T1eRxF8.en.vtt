Peggy three
I<00:00:10.920> think<00:00:11.920> there<00:00:12.010> was<00:00:12.100> a<00:00:12.160> lot<00:00:12.280> of<00:00:12.309> limitations

00:00:12.930 --> 00:00:12.940 
I think there was a lot of limitations

00:00:12.940 --> 00:00:14.490 
I think there was a lot of limitations
in<00:00:13.090> our<00:00:13.180> old<00:00:13.389> collision<00:00:13.809> system<00:00:13.990> it<00:00:14.260> was<00:00:14.320> very

00:00:14.490 --> 00:00:14.500 
in our old collision system it was very

00:00:14.500 --> 00:00:16.109 
in our old collision system it was very
good<00:00:14.709> but<00:00:14.980> it<00:00:15.190> didn't<00:00:15.369> allow<00:00:15.549> us<00:00:15.670> to<00:00:15.760> do<00:00:15.910> some

00:00:16.109 --> 00:00:16.119 
good but it didn't allow us to do some

00:00:16.119 --> 00:00:18.180 
good but it didn't allow us to do some
things<00:00:16.360> that<00:00:16.570> were<00:00:17.050> quite<00:00:17.380> difficult<00:00:17.619> so<00:00:18.160> a

00:00:18.180 --> 00:00:18.190 
things that were quite difficult so a

00:00:18.190 --> 00:00:19.770 
things that were quite difficult so a
lot<00:00:18.369> of<00:00:18.460> times<00:00:18.640> in<00:00:18.789> fifa<00:00:19.090> 11<00:00:19.210> you<00:00:19.570> get<00:00:19.750> a

00:00:19.770 --> 00:00:19.780 
lot of times in fifa 11 you get a

00:00:19.780 --> 00:00:21.600 
lot of times in fifa 11 you get a
situation<00:00:20.440> where<00:00:20.590> maybe<00:00:20.800> two<00:00:21.070> players<00:00:21.370> are

00:00:21.600 --> 00:00:21.610 
situation where maybe two players are

00:00:21.610 --> 00:00:24.810 
situation where maybe two players are
running<00:00:21.940> into<00:00:22.690> one<00:00:22.960> another<00:00:23.020> and<00:00:23.820> because

00:00:24.810 --> 00:00:24.820 
running into one another and because

00:00:24.820 --> 00:00:26.790 
running into one another and because
there's<00:00:25.480> a<00:00:25.570> lot<00:00:25.780> of<00:00:25.810> contacts<00:00:26.350> between<00:00:26.560> those

00:00:26.790 --> 00:00:26.800 
there's a lot of contacts between those

00:00:26.800 --> 00:00:28.800 
there's a lot of contacts between those
two<00:00:26.980> players<00:00:27.250> with<00:00:27.910> the<00:00:28.000> old<00:00:28.150> system<00:00:28.360> we<00:00:28.660> had

00:00:28.800 --> 00:00:28.810 
two players with the old system we had

00:00:28.810 --> 00:00:31.080 
two players with the old system we had
to<00:00:28.930> pick<00:00:29.140> one<00:00:29.350> contact<00:00:30.220> which<00:00:30.850> meant<00:00:31.060> that

00:00:31.080 --> 00:00:31.090 
to pick one contact which meant that

00:00:31.090 --> 00:00:32.819 
to pick one contact which meant that
we'd<00:00:31.270> get<00:00:31.420> it<00:00:31.570> a<00:00:31.690> collision<00:00:32.230> animation<00:00:32.680> that

00:00:32.819 --> 00:00:32.829 
we'd get it a collision animation that

00:00:32.829 --> 00:00:34.110 
we'd get it a collision animation that
did<00:00:32.949> a<00:00:33.010> great<00:00:33.219> job<00:00:33.250> of<00:00:33.489> showing<00:00:33.820> you<00:00:34.000> that

00:00:34.110 --> 00:00:34.120 
did a great job of showing you that

00:00:34.120 --> 00:00:35.520 
did a great job of showing you that
there<00:00:34.270> was<00:00:34.390> a<00:00:34.420> collision<00:00:34.719> something<00:00:35.170> happened

00:00:35.520 --> 00:00:35.530 
there was a collision something happened

00:00:35.530 --> 00:00:37.050 
there was a collision something happened
but<00:00:35.650> maybe<00:00:35.829> didn't<00:00:36.160> take<00:00:36.310> into<00:00:36.430> account<00:00:36.700> every

00:00:37.050 --> 00:00:37.060 
but maybe didn't take into account every

00:00:37.060 --> 00:00:38.880 
but maybe didn't take into account every
little<00:00:37.270> detail<00:00:37.420> with<00:00:38.110> this<00:00:38.290> year's<00:00:38.530> engine

00:00:38.880 --> 00:00:38.890 
little detail with this year's engine

00:00:38.890 --> 00:00:40.319 
little detail with this year's engine
what<00:00:39.040> you<00:00:39.130> see<00:00:39.340> is<00:00:39.579> when<00:00:39.730> those<00:00:39.910> two<00:00:40.090> players

00:00:40.319 --> 00:00:40.329 
what you see is when those two players

00:00:40.329 --> 00:00:42.060 
what you see is when those two players
come<00:00:40.600> together<00:00:40.870> we're<00:00:41.110> resolving<00:00:41.649> for<00:00:41.860> every

00:00:42.060 --> 00:00:42.070 
come together we're resolving for every

00:00:42.070 --> 00:00:44.729 
come together we're resolving for every
single<00:00:42.280> collision<00:00:42.610> that<00:00:42.850> happens<00:00:43.300> and<00:00:44.170> we're

00:00:44.729 --> 00:00:44.739 
single collision that happens and we're

00:00:44.739 --> 00:00:47.400 
single collision that happens and we're
really<00:00:45.310> able<00:00:45.610> to<00:00:45.850> preserve<00:00:46.030> the<00:00:46.390> momentum<00:00:46.899> a

00:00:47.400 --> 00:00:47.410 
really able to preserve the momentum a

00:00:47.410 --> 00:00:49.020 
really able to preserve the momentum a
lot<00:00:47.920> better<00:00:48.160> in<00:00:48.340> the<00:00:48.460> interactions<00:00:48.970> between

00:00:49.020 --> 00:00:49.030 
lot better in the interactions between

00:00:49.030 --> 00:00:51.870 
lot better in the interactions between
players<00:00:49.680> this<00:00:50.680> looks<00:00:50.920> fantastic<00:00:51.070> when<00:00:51.790> you

00:00:51.870 --> 00:00:51.880 
players this looks fantastic when you

00:00:51.880 --> 00:00:53.819 
players this looks fantastic when you
get<00:00:52.030> into<00:00:52.149> the<00:00:52.329> replay<00:00:52.690> camera<00:00:53.110> and<00:00:53.290> you<00:00:53.559> see

00:00:53.819 --> 00:00:53.829 
get into the replay camera and you see

00:00:53.829 --> 00:00:56.610 
get into the replay camera and you see
all<00:00:53.980> of<00:00:54.130> the<00:00:54.510> limbs<00:00:55.510> and<00:00:55.719> the<00:00:55.809> parts<00:00:56.110> bending

00:00:56.610 --> 00:00:56.620 
all of the limbs and the parts bending

00:00:56.620 --> 00:00:58.170 
all of the limbs and the parts bending
and<00:00:56.770> contorting<00:00:57.250> as<00:00:57.370> you<00:00:57.520> would<00:00:57.640> expect<00:00:57.760> them

00:00:58.170 --> 00:00:58.180 
and contorting as you would expect them

00:00:58.180 --> 00:01:00.120 
and contorting as you would expect them
to<00:00:58.360> like<00:00:58.750> you<00:00:58.899> would<00:00:59.020> see<00:00:59.200> on<00:00:59.230> real-world<00:00:59.590> TV

00:01:00.120 --> 00:01:00.130 
to like you would see on real-world TV

00:01:00.130 --> 00:01:02.459 
to like you would see on real-world TV
but<00:01:00.550> it<00:01:00.670> also<00:01:00.850> translates<00:01:01.360> into<00:01:01.809> the<00:01:01.989> telecom

00:01:02.459 --> 00:01:02.469 
but it also translates into the telecom

00:01:02.469 --> 00:01:04.709 
but it also translates into the telecom
where<00:01:03.309> you<00:01:03.399> really<00:01:03.670> feel<00:01:03.940> the<00:01:04.149> difference<00:01:04.540> of

00:01:04.709 --> 00:01:04.719 
where you really feel the difference of

00:01:04.719 --> 00:01:05.850 
where you really feel the difference of
the<00:01:04.899> game<00:01:05.110> and<00:01:05.290> you<00:01:05.320> really<00:01:05.619> feel<00:01:05.829> about

00:01:05.850 --> 00:01:05.860 
the game and you really feel about

00:01:05.860 --> 00:01:08.730 
the game and you really feel about
preservation<00:01:06.280> of<00:01:06.700> momentum<00:01:07.350> another<00:01:08.350> benefit

00:01:08.730 --> 00:01:08.740 
preservation of momentum another benefit

00:01:08.740 --> 00:01:10.830 
preservation of momentum another benefit
that<00:01:08.799> we<00:01:08.920> get<00:01:09.159> is<00:01:09.459> we<00:01:10.119> resolve<00:01:10.479> a<00:01:10.539> lot<00:01:10.659> of<00:01:10.749> our

00:01:10.830 --> 00:01:10.840 
that we get is we resolve a lot of our

00:01:10.840 --> 00:01:13.319 
that we get is we resolve a lot of our
clipping<00:01:11.469> issues<00:01:11.770> in<00:01:11.889> the<00:01:11.979> game<00:01:12.159> this<00:01:12.340> year<00:01:12.399> in

00:01:13.319 --> 00:01:13.329 
clipping issues in the game this year in

00:01:13.329 --> 00:01:14.849 
clipping issues in the game this year in
last<00:01:13.840> year<00:01:14.079> system<00:01:14.439> we<00:01:14.530> didn't<00:01:14.740> actually

00:01:14.849 --> 00:01:14.859 
last year system we didn't actually

00:01:14.859 --> 00:01:16.499 
last year system we didn't actually
account<00:01:15.219> for<00:01:15.340> arm<00:01:15.579> collisions<00:01:15.999> at<00:01:16.119> all<00:01:16.270> and

00:01:16.499 --> 00:01:16.509 
account for arm collisions at all and

00:01:16.509 --> 00:01:18.809 
account for arm collisions at all and
you<00:01:16.810> couldn't<00:01:17.049> really<00:01:17.409> tell<00:01:17.740> in<00:01:18.009> in<00:01:18.310> the

00:01:18.809 --> 00:01:18.819 
you couldn't really tell in in the

00:01:18.819 --> 00:01:20.730 
you couldn't really tell in in the
telecom<00:01:19.270> but<00:01:19.420> if<00:01:19.509> you<00:01:19.600> wanted<00:01:19.779> to<00:01:19.899> replay<00:01:20.289> you

00:01:20.730 --> 00:01:20.740 
telecom but if you wanted to replay you

00:01:20.740 --> 00:01:23.459 
telecom but if you wanted to replay you
would<00:01:20.950> notice<00:01:21.369> that<00:01:22.179> arms<00:01:22.869> could<00:01:23.049> sometimes

00:01:23.459 --> 00:01:23.469 
would notice that arms could sometimes

00:01:23.469 --> 00:01:24.809 
would notice that arms could sometimes
click<00:01:23.740> through<00:01:23.979> a<00:01:24.009> shoulder<00:01:24.459> or<00:01:24.490> click

well<00:01:27.069> this<00:01:27.159> year<00:01:27.310> we're<00:01:27.490> resolving<00:01:27.939> every

00:01:28.199 --> 00:01:28.209 
well this year we're resolving every

00:01:28.209 --> 00:01:29.699 
well this year we're resolving every

results are quite astounding one you

00:01:34.240 --> 00:01:35.639 
results are quite astounding one you
don't<00:01:34.420> actually<00:01:34.779> get<00:01:34.869> the<00:01:34.929> level<00:01:35.259> of<00:01:35.319> clipping

00:01:35.639 --> 00:01:35.649 
don't actually get the level of clipping

don't actually get the level of clipping
that<00:01:35.770> you<00:01:35.829> got<00:01:35.979> in<00:01:36.069> last<00:01:36.189> year's<00:01:36.459> game<00:01:36.490> but<00:01:36.759> to

00:01:36.899 --> 00:01:36.909 
that you got in last year's game but to

00:01:36.909 --> 00:01:39.690 
that you got in last year's game but to
you<00:01:37.090> get<00:01:37.270> tons<00:01:38.079> of<00:01:38.259> variety<00:01:38.799> you<00:01:39.399> don't<00:01:39.579> get

you get tons of variety you don't get

you get tons of variety you don't get

shielding<00:01:43.240> you<00:01:43.569> get<00:01:43.950> more<00:01:44.950> of<00:01:45.069> a<00:01:45.159> tussle

00:01:45.510 --> 00:01:45.520 
shielding you get more of a tussle

00:01:45.520 --> 00:01:46.800 
shielding you get more of a tussle
between<00:01:45.549> the<00:01:45.880> players<00:01:46.119> and<00:01:46.209> a<00:01:46.389> fight<00:01:46.599> for

00:01:46.800 --> 00:01:46.810 
between the players and a fight for

00:01:46.810 --> 00:01:48.269 
between the players and a fight for
possession<00:01:47.200> that<00:01:47.289> feels<00:01:47.560> more<00:01:47.770> realistic

00:01:48.269 --> 00:01:48.279 
possession that feels more realistic

00:01:48.279 --> 00:01:49.529 
possession that feels more realistic
feels<00:01:48.520> like<00:01:48.729> things<00:01:48.909> that<00:01:49.029> you<00:01:49.149> might<00:01:49.270> see<00:01:49.509> on

00:01:49.529 --> 00:01:49.539 
feels like things that you might see on

00:01:49.539 --> 00:01:52.260 
feels like things that you might see on
TV<00:01:50.310> to<00:01:51.310> illustrate<00:01:51.369> the<00:01:51.759> point<00:01:51.969> about<00:01:52.090> the

00:01:52.260 --> 00:01:52.270 
TV to illustrate the point about the

00:01:52.270 --> 00:01:53.609 
TV to illustrate the point about the
variety<00:01:52.419> we<00:01:52.899> get<00:01:53.109> I<00:01:53.229> want<00:01:53.409> to<00:01:53.469> talk<00:01:53.590> about

00:01:53.609 --> 00:01:53.619 
variety we get I want to talk about

00:01:53.619 --> 00:01:55.709 
variety we get I want to talk about
contextual<00:01:54.310> dribble<00:01:54.700> terms<00:01:54.909> and<00:01:55.119> what<00:01:55.599> this

00:01:55.709 --> 00:01:55.719 
contextual dribble terms and what this

00:01:55.719 --> 00:01:58.139 
contextual dribble terms and what this
is<00:01:55.779> is<00:01:55.959> using<00:01:56.740> the<00:01:56.829> left<00:01:57.039> stick<00:01:57.249> you<00:01:57.969> could

00:01:58.139 --> 00:01:58.149 
is is using the left stick you could

00:01:58.149 --> 00:01:59.789 
is is using the left stick you could
beat<00:01:58.299> a<00:01:58.329> player<00:01:58.599> last<00:01:58.869> year<00:01:59.020> by<00:01:59.229> maybe<00:01:59.439> taking

00:01:59.789 --> 00:01:59.799 
beat a player last year by maybe taking

00:01:59.799 --> 00:02:02.330 
beat a player last year by maybe taking
just<00:01:59.979> a<00:02:00.069> 45-degree<00:02:00.729> dribble<00:02:01.060> term<00:02:01.239> but

00:02:02.330 --> 00:02:02.340 
just a 45-degree dribble term but

00:02:02.340 --> 00:02:04.319 
just a 45-degree dribble term but
sometimes<00:02:03.340> when<00:02:03.459> you<00:02:03.549> do<00:02:03.759> that<00:02:03.939> maybe<00:02:04.119> you'd

00:02:04.319 --> 00:02:04.329 
sometimes when you do that maybe you'd

00:02:04.329 --> 00:02:05.609 
sometimes when you do that maybe you'd
knock<00:02:04.479> the<00:02:04.599> ball<00:02:04.749> by<00:02:04.959> him<00:02:04.989> and<00:02:05.259> that<00:02:05.380> player

00:02:05.609 --> 00:02:05.619 
knock the ball by him and that player

00:02:05.619 --> 00:02:07.169 
knock the ball by him and that player
would<00:02:05.829> stick<00:02:06.039> out<00:02:06.130> a<00:02:06.189> leg<00:02:06.429> trying<00:02:06.819> to<00:02:06.939> tackle

00:02:07.169 --> 00:02:07.179 
would stick out a leg trying to tackle

00:02:07.179 --> 00:02:09.059 
would stick out a leg trying to tackle
you<00:02:07.450> or<00:02:07.659> really<00:02:08.289> be<00:02:08.410> in<00:02:08.530> the<00:02:08.619> way<00:02:08.770> of<00:02:08.920> where

you're<00:02:09.160> trying<00:02:09.280> to<00:02:09.369> go<00:02:09.459> after<00:02:09.700> the<00:02:09.940> ball<00:02:10.030> has

00:02:10.229 --> 00:02:10.239 
you're trying to go after the ball has

00:02:10.239 --> 00:02:12.360 
you're trying to go after the ball has
passed<00:02:10.479> him<00:02:10.690> so<00:02:11.530> when<00:02:11.680> you<00:02:11.740> add<00:02:11.890> this<00:02:12.100> year's

00:02:12.360 --> 00:02:12.370 
passed him so when you add this year's

00:02:12.370 --> 00:02:14.580 
passed him so when you add this year's
engine<00:02:12.730> on<00:02:12.850> top<00:02:13.120> of<00:02:13.330> the<00:02:13.690> contextual<00:02:14.260> dribble

00:02:21.509 --> 00:02:21.519 
the game like for instance a player

00:02:21.519 --> 00:02:24.479 
the game like for instance a player
knocking<00:02:22.299> the<00:02:22.390> ball<00:02:22.959> by<00:02:23.230> a<00:02:23.530> defender<00:02:24.159> he

00:02:24.479 --> 00:02:24.489 
knocking the ball by a defender he

00:02:24.489 --> 00:02:26.339 
knocking the ball by a defender he
sticks<00:02:24.730> out<00:02:24.849> a<00:02:24.909> leg<00:02:25.120> to<00:02:25.239> tackle<00:02:25.659> and<00:02:25.810> the

00:02:33.390 --> 00:02:33.400 
tackle and the way that his legs bend

00:02:33.400 --> 00:02:35.130 
tackle and the way that his legs bend
because<00:02:33.760> he's<00:02:33.879> been<00:02:34.030> caught<00:02:34.209> it<00:02:34.599> creates

00:02:35.130 --> 00:02:35.140 
because he's been caught it creates

00:02:35.140 --> 00:02:36.630 
because he's been caught it creates
another<00:02:35.409> level<00:02:35.739> of<00:02:35.799> variety<00:02:36.220> that<00:02:36.340> we<00:02:36.400> just

00:02:36.630 --> 00:02:36.640 
another level of variety that we just

00:02:36.640 --> 00:02:38.119 
another level of variety that we just
wouldn't<00:02:36.790> have<00:02:36.940> had<00:02:37.030> in<00:02:37.180> the<00:02:37.269> game<00:02:37.450> last<00:02:37.720> year

00:02:38.119 --> 00:02:38.129 
wouldn't have had in the game last year

00:02:38.129 --> 00:02:41.309 
wouldn't have had in the game last year
further<00:02:39.129> to<00:02:39.310> that<00:02:39.510> what<00:02:40.510> you<00:02:40.599> can<00:02:40.720> see<00:02:40.900> sup<00:02:41.110> now

00:02:41.309 --> 00:02:41.319 
further to that what you can see sup now

00:02:41.319 --> 00:02:43.800 
further to that what you can see sup now
is<00:02:41.560> sometimes<00:02:41.950> a<00:02:42.159> dribbler<00:02:42.430> will<00:02:42.819> knock<00:02:43.659> the

is sometimes a dribbler will knock the

00:02:43.810 --> 00:02:45.119 
is sometimes a dribbler will knock the
ball<00:02:43.930> by<00:02:44.109> a<00:02:44.140> defender<00:02:44.470> using<00:02:44.859> one<00:02:44.980> of<00:02:45.010> these

dribble<00:02:45.430> turns<00:02:45.609> jump<00:02:45.970> out<00:02:46.090> of<00:02:46.120> the<00:02:46.239> way<00:02:46.390> and

00:02:46.619 --> 00:02:46.629 
dribble turns jump out of the way and

00:02:46.629 --> 00:02:48.509 
dribble turns jump out of the way and
gets<00:02:46.870> caught<00:02:47.079> but<00:02:47.470> just<00:02:47.680> slightly<00:02:47.950> so<00:02:48.459> he

00:02:48.509 --> 00:02:48.519 
gets caught but just slightly so he

00:02:48.519 --> 00:02:50.369 
gets caught but just slightly so he
takes<00:02:48.670> a<00:02:48.819> small<00:02:48.970> knock<00:02:49.329> and<00:02:49.629> what<00:02:50.049> you<00:02:50.140> get<00:02:50.319> is

00:02:50.369 --> 00:02:50.379 
takes a small knock and what you get is

00:02:50.379 --> 00:02:52.050 
takes a small knock and what you get is
a<00:02:50.530> little<00:02:50.769> bit<00:02:50.890> more<00:02:51.040> resilience<00:02:51.790> from<00:02:51.970> the

00:02:52.050 --> 00:02:52.060 
a little bit more resilience from the

00:02:52.060 --> 00:02:53.520 
a little bit more resilience from the
player<00:02:52.269> to<00:02:52.420> take<00:02:52.569> those<00:02:52.780> small<00:02:53.079> knocks<00:02:53.349> and

00:02:53.520 --> 00:02:53.530 
player to take those small knocks and

00:02:53.530 --> 00:02:55.500 
player to take those small knocks and
able<00:02:54.010> to<00:02:54.099> continue<00:02:54.549> on<00:02:54.730> and<00:02:54.940> go<00:02:55.060> after<00:02:55.239> the

able to continue on and go after the

00:02:55.510 --> 00:02:57.839 
able to continue on and go after the
ball<00:02:55.690> now<00:02:56.290> players<00:02:56.620> like<00:02:56.829> Messi<00:02:57.190> can<00:02:57.430> skip

00:02:57.839 --> 00:02:57.849 
ball now players like Messi can skip

00:02:57.849 --> 00:02:59.160 
ball now players like Messi can skip
through<00:02:58.060> those<00:02:58.209> challenge<00:02:58.629> take<00:02:58.840> a<00:02:58.870> knock

00:02:59.160 --> 00:02:59.170 
through those challenge take a knock

00:03:02.789 --> 00:03:02.799 
continue on to really pursue the ball

00:03:02.799 --> 00:03:04.740 
continue on to really pursue the ball
and<00:03:03.010> continue<00:03:03.549> the<00:03:03.700> flow<00:03:03.909> of<00:03:03.940> the<00:03:04.090> game<00:03:04.120> and<00:03:04.480> it

and continue the flow of the game and it

00:03:04.750 --> 00:03:05.849

makes for a much more exciting

00:03:05.859 --> 00:03:07.229
