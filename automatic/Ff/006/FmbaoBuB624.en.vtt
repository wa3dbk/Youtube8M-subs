00:03:30.240 --> 00:03:31.760 
it was crazy that we have a class
together<00:03:30.390> because<00:03:30.780> we<00:03:30.870> even<00:03:31.110> sign<00:03:31.320> up<00:03:31.350> for<00:03:31.710> it

00:03:31.760 --> 00:03:31.770 
together because we even sign up for it

00:03:31.770 --> 00:03:35.210 
together because we even sign up for it
and<00:03:32.150> we<00:03:33.150> were<00:03:33.270> talking<00:03:33.420> alike<00:03:34.020> yeah<00:03:34.740> I<00:03:34.770> had

00:03:35.210 --> 00:03:35.220 
and we were talking alike yeah I had

00:03:35.220 --> 00:03:38.110 
and we were talking alike yeah I had
this<00:03:35.340> class<00:03:35.580> on<00:03:35.970> tuesdays<00:03:36.330> and<00:03:36.480> thursdays<00:03:36.990> and

00:03:38.110 --> 00:03:38.120 
this class on tuesdays and thursdays and

00:03:38.120 --> 00:03:42.350 
this class on tuesdays and thursdays and
get<00:03:39.120> this<00:03:39.570> in<00:03:39.690> this<00:03:39.840> and<00:03:40.020> really<00:03:40.230> I<00:03:41.150> think<00:03:42.150> we

00:03:42.350 --> 00:03:42.360 
get this in this and really I think we

00:03:42.360 --> 00:03:45.440 
get this in this and really I think we
have<00:03:42.390> class<00:03:42.630> together<00:03:42.830> so<00:03:43.830> we<00:03:44.580> look<00:03:44.790> to<00:03:45.000> see<00:03:45.210> if

00:03:45.440 --> 00:03:45.450 
have class together so we look to see if

00:03:45.450 --> 00:03:48.860 
have class together so we look to see if
um<00:03:45.950> indeed<00:03:46.950> or<00:03:47.490> if<00:03:47.820> we<00:03:48.030> had<00:03:48.480> a<00:03:48.510> class<00:03:48.690> together

00:03:48.860 --> 00:03:48.870
