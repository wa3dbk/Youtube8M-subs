00:01:06.010 --> 00:01:06.020 
you know you you draw one line and then

00:01:06.020 --> 00:01:07.929 
you know you you draw one line and then
you<00:01:06.170> draw<00:01:06.440> over<00:01:06.800> that<00:01:06.979> line<00:01:07.220> with<00:01:07.610> another

line and you know it's not making the
line<00:01:16.880> look<00:01:17.180> better<00:01:17.390> you<00:01:17.600> just<00:01:17.780> making<00:01:18.080> it

00:01:18.190 --> 00:01:18.200 
line look better you just making it

00:01:18.200 --> 00:01:26.859 
line look better you just making it
fatter<00:01:18.490> and<00:01:21.909> you<00:01:22.909> really<00:01:23.390> want<00:01:23.689> to<00:01:25.869> explore

00:01:32.420 --> 00:01:32.430 

00:01:32.430 --> 00:01:35.330 

the<00:01:32.940> only<00:01:33.090> way<00:01:33.300> to<00:01:33.330> get<00:01:33.600> better<00:01:33.780> is<00:01:34.170> to<00:01:34.890> try<00:01:35.130> new

00:01:35.330 --> 00:01:35.340 
the only way to get better is to try new

00:01:35.340 --> 00:01:38.180 
the only way to get better is to try new
things<00:01:35.630> the<00:01:36.630> only<00:01:36.780> way<00:01:37.020> to<00:01:37.080> grow<00:01:37.530> is<00:01:37.560> to<00:01:37.980> try

00:01:38.180 --> 00:01:38.190 
things the only way to grow is to try

00:01:38.190 --> 00:01:39.920 
things the only way to grow is to try
anything<00:01:38.430> you<00:01:38.760> can't<00:01:39.060> continue<00:01:39.450> to<00:01:39.630> do<00:01:39.840> the

00:01:39.920 --> 00:01:39.930 
anything you can't continue to do the

00:01:39.930 --> 00:01:42.110 
anything you can't continue to do the
same<00:01:40.170> thing<00:01:40.500> and<00:01:40.830> expect<00:01:41.760> something

00:01:42.110 --> 00:01:42.120 
same thing and expect something

00:01:42.120 --> 00:01:44.810 
same thing and expect something
different<00:01:42.150> that<00:01:42.570> happens<00:01:43.310> that<00:01:44.310> right<00:01:44.520> there

00:01:44.810 --> 00:01:44.820 
different that happens that right there

00:01:44.820 --> 00:01:46.940 
different that happens that right there
is<00:01:45.690> the<00:01:45.720> one<00:01:45.870> tell<00:01:46.260> me<00:01:46.380> that<00:01:46.530> that's<00:01:46.650> called

00:01:46.940 --> 00:01:46.950 
is the one tell me that that's called

00:01:46.950 --> 00:01:48.890 
is the one tell me that that's called
insanity<00:01:47.310> but<00:01:48.000> whatever<00:01:48.330> you<00:01:48.510> want<00:01:48.690> to<00:01:48.750> call
