civilization games that have been the

most important thing the most fun part
of<00:02:01.689> the<00:02:01.780> game<00:02:02.670> with<00:02:03.670> the<00:02:03.790> leaders<00:02:04.119> the<00:02:04.330> main

00:02:04.469 --> 00:02:04.479 
of the game with the leaders the main

00:02:04.479 --> 00:02:06.060 
of the game with the leaders the main
thing<00:02:04.780> was<00:02:05.020> that<00:02:05.290> we<00:02:05.409> wanted<00:02:05.590> to<00:02:05.799> have<00:02:06.009> a

00:02:06.060 --> 00:02:06.070 
thing was that we wanted to have a

00:02:06.070 --> 00:02:08.340 
thing was that we wanted to have a
variety<00:02:06.759> from<00:02:06.970> all<00:02:07.210> across<00:02:07.509> the<00:02:07.810> world<00:02:07.840> and

00:02:08.340 --> 00:02:08.350 
variety from all across the world and

00:02:08.350 --> 00:02:10.199 
variety from all across the world and
the<00:02:08.979> leaders<00:02:09.310> are<00:02:09.489> a<00:02:09.520> big<00:02:09.640> part<00:02:09.819> of<00:02:09.940> that<00:02:10.000> as

00:02:10.199 --> 00:02:10.209 
the leaders are a big part of that as

00:02:10.209 --> 00:02:12.300 
the leaders are a big part of that as
well<00:02:10.239> some<00:02:10.840> suggestions<00:02:11.709> have<00:02:11.860> been<00:02:11.920> thrown

00:02:12.300 --> 00:02:12.310 
well some suggestions have been thrown

00:02:12.310 --> 00:02:14.729 
well some suggestions have been thrown
around<00:02:12.430> in<00:02:12.610> the<00:02:12.700> past<00:02:12.940> of<00:02:13.300> maybe<00:02:13.959> we<00:02:14.290> can<00:02:14.500> have

00:02:14.729 --> 00:02:14.739 
around in the past of maybe we can have

00:02:14.739 --> 00:02:17.490 
around in the past of maybe we can have
a<00:02:15.130> system<00:02:15.519> where<00:02:15.580> leaders<00:02:16.180> will<00:02:16.600> you<00:02:17.290> know<00:02:17.410> you

00:02:17.490 --> 00:02:17.500 
a system where leaders will you know you

00:02:17.500 --> 00:02:19.290 
a system where leaders will you know you
create<00:02:18.100> your<00:02:18.220> own<00:02:18.280> leader<00:02:18.610> you<00:02:18.940> build<00:02:19.180> a

00:02:19.290 --> 00:02:19.300 
create your own leader you build a

00:02:19.300 --> 00:02:21.030 
create your own leader you build a
leader<00:02:19.510> you<00:02:19.599> give<00:02:19.900> him<00:02:20.110> the<00:02:20.230> traits<00:02:20.560> you<00:02:20.739> name

00:02:21.030 --> 00:02:21.040 
leader you give him the traits you name

00:02:21.040 --> 00:02:22.440 
leader you give him the traits you name
him<00:02:21.220> you<00:02:21.430> give<00:02:21.580> them<00:02:21.700> a<00:02:21.760> color<00:02:21.970> to<00:02:22.209> give<00:02:22.330> them<00:02:22.420> a

00:02:22.440 --> 00:02:22.450 
him you give them a color to give them a

00:02:22.450 --> 00:02:24.420 
him you give them a color to give them a
flag<00:02:22.720> that<00:02:22.750> sort<00:02:23.140> of<00:02:23.170> thing<00:02:23.290> and<00:02:23.590> it's<00:02:24.130> it's

00:02:24.420 --> 00:02:24.430 
flag that sort of thing and it's it's

00:02:24.430 --> 00:02:26.640 
flag that sort of thing and it's it's
been<00:02:24.640> thrown<00:02:24.880> around<00:02:25.030> but<00:02:25.870> it's<00:02:26.140> one<00:02:26.440> of<00:02:26.470> those

00:02:26.640 --> 00:02:26.650 
been thrown around but it's one of those

00:02:26.650 --> 00:02:28.259 
been thrown around but it's one of those
things<00:02:26.709> where<00:02:27.010> we<00:02:27.310> always<00:02:27.459> felt<00:02:27.819> that<00:02:27.910> the

00:02:28.259 --> 00:02:28.269 
things where we always felt that the

00:02:28.269 --> 00:02:30.030 
things where we always felt that the
leaders<00:02:28.660> that<00:02:29.350> you<00:02:29.470> know<00:02:29.680> and<00:02:29.860> that<00:02:29.950> you

00:02:30.030 --> 00:02:30.040 
leaders that you know and that you

00:02:30.040 --> 00:02:32.550 
leaders that you know and that you
recognize<00:02:30.610> are<00:02:30.910> significant<00:02:31.690> it<00:02:32.260> means

00:02:32.550 --> 00:02:32.560 
recognize are significant it means

00:02:32.560 --> 00:02:35.160 
recognize are significant it means
something<00:02:32.680> it<00:02:33.370> helps<00:02:33.700> draw<00:02:34.000> you<00:02:34.060> in<00:02:34.390> more<00:02:34.930> than

00:02:35.160 --> 00:02:35.170 
something it helps draw you in more than

00:02:35.170 --> 00:02:37.350 
something it helps draw you in more than
if<00:02:35.470> you<00:02:35.650> just<00:02:35.680> saw<00:02:36.069> a<00:02:36.100> generic<00:02:36.640> character<00:02:37.060> that

00:02:37.350 --> 00:02:37.360 
if you just saw a generic character that

00:02:37.360 --> 00:02:40.140 
if you just saw a generic character that
was<00:02:37.390> militaristic<00:02:38.260> and<00:02:38.920> industrious<00:02:39.790> on<00:02:40.090> the

00:02:40.140 --> 00:02:40.150 
was militaristic and industrious on the

00:02:40.150 --> 00:02:42.550 
was militaristic and industrious on the
site

00:02:42.550 --> 00:02:42.560 

00:02:42.560 --> 00:02:44.710 

we<00:02:43.220> wanted<00:02:43.700> to<00:02:43.760> make<00:02:44.000> sure<00:02:44.060> that<00:02:44.330> we<00:02:44.420> had<00:02:44.599> the

00:02:44.710 --> 00:02:44.720 
we wanted to make sure that we had the

00:02:44.720 --> 00:02:47.500 
we wanted to make sure that we had the
same<00:02:44.959> scope<00:02:45.470> for<00:02:45.890> modding<00:02:46.280> in<00:02:46.400> civ<00:02:46.640> 5<00:02:46.910> there

00:02:47.500 --> 00:02:47.510 
same scope for modding in civ 5 there

00:02:47.510 --> 00:02:49.720 
same scope for modding in civ 5 there
wasn't<00:02:47.840> really<00:02:47.900> a<00:02:48.020> lot<00:02:48.319> extra<00:02:49.040> we<00:02:49.280> could<00:02:49.459> add

00:02:49.720 --> 00:02:49.730 
wasn't really a lot extra we could add

00:02:49.730 --> 00:02:52.330 
wasn't really a lot extra we could add
to<00:02:50.060> make<00:02:50.239> moddable<00:02:50.630> so<00:02:51.020> our<00:02:51.560> main<00:02:51.830> focus<00:02:52.220> was

00:02:52.330 --> 00:02:52.340 
to make moddable so our main focus was

00:02:52.340 --> 00:02:54.070 
to make moddable so our main focus was
making<00:02:52.819> it<00:02:53.000> so<00:02:53.239> that<00:02:53.270> it<00:02:53.540> was<00:02:53.660> a<00:02:53.690> little<00:02:53.930> bit

00:02:54.070 --> 00:02:54.080 
making it so that it was a little bit

00:02:54.080 --> 00:02:56.830 
making it so that it was a little bit
easier<00:02:54.380> to<00:02:54.500> get<00:02:54.590> into<00:02:54.800> and<00:02:55.420> a<00:02:56.420> little<00:02:56.720> bit

00:02:56.830 --> 00:02:56.840 
easier to get into and a little bit

00:02:56.840 --> 00:03:00.250 
easier to get into and a little bit
easier<00:02:56.959> to<00:02:57.260> find<00:02:57.560> and<00:02:58.000> upload<00:02:59.000> and<00:02:59.300> make<00:02:59.930> your

00:03:00.250 --> 00:03:00.260 
easier to find and upload and make your

00:03:00.260 --> 00:03:02.380 
easier to find and upload and make your
moms<00:03:00.440> available<00:03:01.069> it's<00:03:01.310> very<00:03:01.459> easy<00:03:01.580> to<00:03:01.730> use<00:03:02.060> as

00:03:02.380 --> 00:03:02.390 
moms available it's very easy to use as

00:03:02.390 --> 00:03:04.330 
moms available it's very easy to use as
well<00:03:02.599> so<00:03:02.989> we're<00:03:03.560> hoping<00:03:03.860> a<00:03:03.980> lot<00:03:04.099> of<00:03:04.220> people

00:03:04.330 --> 00:03:04.340 
well so we're hoping a lot of people

00:03:04.340 --> 00:03:05.620 
well so we're hoping a lot of people
that<00:03:04.519> may<00:03:04.730> have<00:03:04.819> been<00:03:04.880> intimidated<00:03:05.540> by

00:03:05.620 --> 00:03:05.630 
that may have been intimidated by

00:03:05.630 --> 00:03:07.509 
that may have been intimidated by
modding<00:03:06.050> and<00:03:06.200> the<00:03:06.500> earlier<00:03:06.800> games<00:03:06.860> will<00:03:07.280> try

00:03:07.509 --> 00:03:07.519 
modding and the earlier games will try

00:03:07.519 --> 00:03:10.390 
modding and the earlier games will try
it<00:03:07.580> out<00:03:07.760> and<00:03:07.790> start<00:03:08.660> making<00:03:08.870> stuff<00:03:09.380> we<00:03:09.860> have<00:03:10.069> a

00:03:10.390 --> 00:03:10.400 
it out and start making stuff we have a

00:03:10.400 --> 00:03:13.600 
it out and start making stuff we have a
mod<00:03:11.090> browser<00:03:11.540> which<00:03:12.170> is<00:03:12.349> actually<00:03:12.680> directly

00:03:13.600 --> 00:03:13.610 
mod browser which is actually directly

00:03:13.610 --> 00:03:15.910 
mod browser which is actually directly
available<00:03:14.000> from<00:03:14.420> within<00:03:14.750> the<00:03:14.900> game<00:03:15.080> so<00:03:15.680> if<00:03:15.799> you

00:03:15.910 --> 00:03:15.920 
available from within the game so if you

00:03:15.920 --> 00:03:17.470 
available from within the game so if you
go<00:03:16.040> to<00:03:16.100> the<00:03:16.220> main<00:03:16.370> menu<00:03:16.400> you<00:03:16.910> can<00:03:16.940> get<00:03:17.239> to<00:03:17.360> it

00:03:17.470 --> 00:03:17.480 
go to the main menu you can get to it

go to the main menu you can get to it
from<00:03:17.510> there<00:03:17.900> and<00:03:18.140> then<00:03:18.350> mods<00:03:19.160> that<00:03:19.310> have<00:03:19.459> been

we<00:03:23.870> felt<00:03:24.530> that<00:03:24.620> this<00:03:24.920> was<00:03:24.980> an<00:03:25.310> excellent<00:03:25.610> way

00:03:25.900 --> 00:03:25.910 
we felt that this was an excellent way

00:03:25.910 --> 00:03:28.809 
we felt that this was an excellent way
of<00:03:25.940> making<00:03:26.540> mods<00:03:26.989> more<00:03:27.890> available<00:03:28.430> to<00:03:28.489> the
