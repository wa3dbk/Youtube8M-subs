00:00:14.679 --> 00:00:17.949
 Scores 

00:00:17.949 --> 00:00:22.420
 Both Button and Fischer have been doing quite new behaviors lately 

00:00:22.419 --> 00:00:23.400
 developed 

00:00:23.400 --> 00:00:27.680
 these are so unusual that nobody remembers Plants coast 

00:00:27.680 --> 00:00:30.099
 can ever have heard of it 

00:00:30.099 --> 00:00:33.830
 recently Roppen use sea bays as veritable fish traps 

00:00:35.420 --> 00:00:39.060
 a group of harp seals has driven a cod Swabia into the bay 

00:00:39.060 --> 00:00:41.650
 that never happened before 

00:00:41.650 --> 00:00:45.730
 Scientists suspect the reason for this is that the cabriolet swarms 

00:00:45.730 --> 00:00:47.620
 once were significantly larger 

00:00:47.620 --> 00:00:50.270
 a big swarm do not panic device 

00:00:50.270 --> 00:00:53.270
 and certainly not in a trap 

00:00:53.810 --> 00:00:56.900
 In the bay, the fish have no way to escape 

00:00:56.900 --> 00:01:00.760
 they have no choice but to keep the seals at a distance 

00:01:00.760 --> 00:01:03.140
 to flee to the shore 

00:01:03.140 --> 00:01:07.250
 This behavior of fish and seals is so new that it is not 

00:01:07.250 --> 00:01:10.250
 there are scientific studies about it 

00:01:19.270 --> 00:01:22.270
 Owen have recently turned out to be true foodies 

00:01:26.390 --> 00:01:29.340
 Red bull-pilot Red 

00:01:29.340 --> 00:01:32.530
 Once again, they did not beat us as a team 

00:01:32.530 --> 00:01:35.530
 only eat the liver he has seen like no one prefer with 

00:01:36.250 --> 00:01:40.850
 they point them out and let the rest just bike path 04 crashes 

00:01:40.850 --> 00:01:42.780
 and then come the solution 

00:01:42.780 --> 00:01:44.520
 enough 

00:01:44.520 --> 00:01:47.090
 so that should 

00:01:47.090 --> 00:01:50.650
 The extent of this charge year hunts becomes particularly evident underwater 

00:01:51.240 --> 00:01:54.490
 the bottom of this bay is covered with Totem Kappeler 

00:01:55.080 --> 00:01:59.510
 these images refute the view seals would not eat a convertible because 

00:01:59.510 --> 00:02:01.330
 her mouth was too small for big fish
