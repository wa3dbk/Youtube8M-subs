00:00:00.149 --> 00:00:01.250 

so<00:00:00.420> I've<00:00:00.539> been<00:00:00.659> playing<00:00:00.930> Super<00:00:01.110> Smash

00:00:01.250 --> 00:00:01.260 
so I've been playing Super Smash

00:00:01.260 --> 00:00:03.260 
so I've been playing Super Smash
Brothers<00:00:01.709> for<00:00:02.040> quite<00:00:02.250> some<00:00:02.520> time<00:00:02.550> and<00:00:03.060> over

00:00:03.260 --> 00:00:03.270 
Brothers for quite some time and over

00:00:03.270 --> 00:00:04.999 
Brothers for quite some time and over
the<00:00:03.389> years<00:00:03.629> I<00:00:03.840> think<00:00:03.870> I've<00:00:04.230> come<00:00:04.620> up<00:00:04.799> with<00:00:04.830> a

00:00:04.999 --> 00:00:05.009 
the years I think I've come up with a

00:00:05.009 --> 00:00:08.089 
the years I think I've come up with a
type<00:00:05.430> of<00:00:05.609> theory<00:00:06.330> if<00:00:06.569> you<00:00:06.839> will<00:00:07.020> about<00:00:07.799> the

00:00:08.089 --> 00:00:08.099 
type of theory if you will about the

00:00:08.099 --> 00:00:09.770 
type of theory if you will about the
people<00:00:08.370> who<00:00:08.460> play<00:00:08.670> Super<00:00:08.970> Smash<00:00:09.000> Brothers<00:00:09.389> and

00:00:09.770 --> 00:00:09.780 
people who play Super Smash Brothers and

00:00:09.780 --> 00:00:11.749 
people who play Super Smash Brothers and
what<00:00:10.080> I<00:00:10.110> like<00:00:10.320> to<00:00:10.349> call<00:00:10.590> it<00:00:10.769> is<00:00:10.889> the<00:00:11.099> food<00:00:11.490> chain

00:00:11.749 --> 00:00:11.759 
what I like to call it is the food chain

00:00:11.759 --> 00:00:13.700 
what I like to call it is the food chain
theory<00:00:12.150> and<00:00:12.480> it's<00:00:12.780> probably<00:00:13.200> best<00:00:13.410> not<00:00:13.559> to

00:00:13.700 --> 00:00:13.710 
theory and it's probably best not to

00:00:13.710 --> 00:00:15.589 
theory and it's probably best not to
debate<00:00:13.980> me<00:00:14.280> on<00:00:14.309> this<00:00:14.549> because<00:00:14.790> I'm<00:00:15.179> just<00:00:15.480> gonna

00:00:15.589 --> 00:00:15.599 
debate me on this because I'm just gonna

00:00:15.599 --> 00:00:17.300 
debate me on this because I'm just gonna
say<00:00:15.839> him<00:00:15.960> right<00:00:16.139> anyway<00:00:16.529> if<00:00:16.710> you<00:00:16.770> look<00:00:16.980> at<00:00:17.160> it

00:00:17.300 --> 00:00:17.310 
say him right anyway if you look at it

00:00:17.310 --> 00:00:17.630 
say him right anyway if you look at it
really

00:00:17.630 --> 00:00:17.640 
really

00:00:17.640 --> 00:00:20.150 
really
there's<00:00:17.940> players<00:00:18.390> of<00:00:18.990> a<00:00:19.260> certain<00:00:19.560> caliber<00:00:19.859> and

00:00:20.150 --> 00:00:20.160 
there's players of a certain caliber and

00:00:20.160 --> 00:00:22.849 
there's players of a certain caliber and
players<00:00:20.400> of<00:00:20.699> another<00:00:20.970> certain<00:00:21.300> caliber<00:00:21.570> so<00:00:22.230> we

00:00:22.849 --> 00:00:22.859 
players of another certain caliber so we

00:00:22.859 --> 00:00:24.740 
players of another certain caliber so we
got<00:00:23.039> to<00:00:23.130> stack<00:00:23.310> those<00:00:23.490> up<00:00:23.760> and<00:00:23.910> on<00:00:24.240> the<00:00:24.269> bottom

00:00:24.740 --> 00:00:24.750 
got to stack those up and on the bottom

00:00:24.750 --> 00:00:26.450 
got to stack those up and on the bottom
of<00:00:24.840> that<00:00:24.900> stack<00:00:25.320> are<00:00:25.529> the<00:00:25.650> bottom<00:00:26.039> feeders

00:00:26.450 --> 00:00:26.460 
of that stack are the bottom feeders

00:00:26.460 --> 00:00:28.460 
of that stack are the bottom feeders
basically<00:00:27.300> those<00:00:27.539> are<00:00:27.720> the<00:00:27.810> little<00:00:27.960> kids<00:00:28.289> who

00:00:28.460 --> 00:00:28.470 
basically those are the little kids who

00:00:28.470 --> 00:00:30.500 
basically those are the little kids who
just<00:00:28.680> woke<00:00:28.859> up<00:00:29.039> Christmas<00:00:29.340> morning<00:00:29.550> and<00:00:29.970> got
