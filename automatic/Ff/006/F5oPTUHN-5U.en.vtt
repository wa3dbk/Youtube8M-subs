00:00:00.060 --> 00:00:02.119 

the<00:00:00.719> last<00:00:00.930> we're<00:00:01.170> going<00:00:01.290> to<00:00:01.380> talk<00:00:01.560> about<00:00:01.709> is<00:00:02.100> a

00:00:02.119 --> 00:00:02.129 
the last we're going to talk about is a

00:00:02.129 --> 00:00:04.400 
the last we're going to talk about is a
tool<00:00:02.610> for<00:00:02.820> creating<00:00:03.090> secondary<00:00:03.570> dynamic

00:00:04.400 --> 00:00:04.410 
tool for creating secondary dynamic

00:00:04.410 --> 00:00:06.829 
tool for creating secondary dynamic
animation<00:00:04.920> for<00:00:05.370> characters<00:00:06.120> and<00:00:06.420> objects

00:00:06.829 --> 00:00:06.839 
animation for characters and objects

00:00:06.839 --> 00:00:10.459 
animation for characters and objects
using<00:00:07.319> dynamic<00:00:08.099> joint<00:00:08.280> chains<00:00:09.170> make<00:00:10.170> joints

00:00:10.459 --> 00:00:10.469 
using dynamic joint chains make joints

00:00:10.469 --> 00:00:12.799 
using dynamic joint chains make joints
dynamic<00:00:11.010> allows<00:00:11.519> us<00:00:11.759> to<00:00:11.940> connect<00:00:12.300> things<00:00:12.480> like

00:00:12.799 --> 00:00:12.809 
dynamic allows us to connect things like

00:00:12.809 --> 00:00:15.919 
dynamic allows us to connect things like
hair<00:00:13.320> and<00:00:13.530> in<00:00:14.099> cloth<00:00:14.429> to<00:00:14.820> a<00:00:15.210> series<00:00:15.630> of<00:00:15.750> joint

00:00:15.919 --> 00:00:15.929 
hair and in cloth to a series of joint

00:00:15.929 --> 00:00:18.620 
hair and in cloth to a series of joint
chains<00:00:16.460> so<00:00:17.460> in<00:00:17.730> this<00:00:17.880> example<00:00:18.210> I've<00:00:18.449> got<00:00:18.570> a

00:00:18.620 --> 00:00:18.630 
chains so in this example I've got a

00:00:18.630 --> 00:00:20.750 
chains so in this example I've got a
basic<00:00:18.869> joint<00:00:19.289> chain<00:00:19.529> and<00:00:19.740> I<00:00:20.010> want<00:00:20.250> to<00:00:20.430> make

00:00:20.750 --> 00:00:20.760 
basic joint chain and I want to make

00:00:20.760 --> 00:00:22.220 
basic joint chain and I want to make
part<00:00:21.029> of<00:00:21.060> it<00:00:21.180> dynamic<00:00:21.660> so<00:00:21.900> I'm<00:00:22.020> going<00:00:22.170> to

00:00:22.220 --> 00:00:22.230 
part of it dynamic so I'm going to

00:00:22.230 --> 00:00:23.720 
part of it dynamic so I'm going to
select<00:00:22.410> a<00:00:22.590> joint<00:00:22.859> and<00:00:23.070> then<00:00:23.430> I'm<00:00:23.519> going<00:00:23.640> to

00:00:23.720 --> 00:00:23.730 
select a joint and then I'm going to

00:00:23.730 --> 00:00:28.279 
select a joint and then I'm going to
shift<00:00:24.000> select<00:00:24.359> the<00:00:24.750> end<00:00:25.050> joint<00:00:25.590> from<00:00:26.010> that<00:00:27.289> now

00:00:28.279 --> 00:00:28.289 
shift select the end joint from that now

00:00:28.289 --> 00:00:30.109 
shift select the end joint from that now
I'm<00:00:28.439> going<00:00:28.619> to<00:00:28.710> go<00:00:28.800> in<00:00:29.010> and<00:00:29.250> apply<00:00:29.460> a<00:00:29.730> hair

00:00:30.109 --> 00:00:30.119 
I'm going to go in and apply a hair

00:00:30.119 --> 00:00:31.730 
I'm going to go in and apply a hair
driver<00:00:30.539> and<00:00:30.869> I'll<00:00:31.230> just<00:00:31.349> use<00:00:31.529> the<00:00:31.650> default

00:00:31.730 --> 00:00:31.740 
driver and I'll just use the default

00:00:31.740 --> 00:00:34.190 
driver and I'll just use the default
settings<00:00:32.309> here<00:00:32.460> and<00:00:32.520> apply<00:00:32.969> and<00:00:33.300> what<00:00:34.050> you'll

00:00:34.190 --> 00:00:34.200 
settings here and apply and what you'll

00:00:34.200 --> 00:00:36.229 
settings here and apply and what you'll
see<00:00:34.290> is<00:00:34.410> if<00:00:34.620> I<00:00:34.739> push<00:00:34.950> play<00:00:35.130> I<00:00:35.489> get<00:00:35.760> a<00:00:35.790> subtle

00:00:36.229 --> 00:00:36.239 
see is if I push play I get a subtle

00:00:36.239 --> 00:00:39.229 
see is if I push play I get a subtle
motion<00:00:36.480> with<00:00:36.989> my<00:00:37.020> joint<00:00:37.380> chain<00:00:38.000> so<00:00:39.000> without

00:00:39.229 --> 00:00:39.239 
motion with my joint chain so without

00:00:39.239 --> 00:00:41.540 
motion with my joint chain so without
any<00:00:39.450> inherent<00:00:40.050> or<00:00:40.260> initial<00:00:40.739> motion<00:00:41.129> I<00:00:41.309> don't

00:00:41.540 --> 00:00:41.550 
any inherent or initial motion I don't

00:00:41.550 --> 00:00:43.340 
any inherent or initial motion I don't
really<00:00:41.700> have<00:00:41.910> much<00:00:42.120> secondary<00:00:42.600> motion<00:00:42.809> to<00:00:43.079> see

00:00:43.340 --> 00:00:43.350 
really have much secondary motion to see

00:00:43.350 --> 00:00:45.319 
really have much secondary motion to see
so<00:00:43.649> what<00:00:43.800> I<00:00:43.829> can<00:00:43.920> do<00:00:44.160> is<00:00:44.370> grab<00:00:44.640> the<00:00:44.850> base<00:00:45.059> of

00:00:45.319 --> 00:00:45.329 
so what I can do is grab the base of

00:00:45.329 --> 00:00:47.750 
so what I can do is grab the base of
this<00:00:45.480> joint<00:00:46.020> chain<00:00:46.289> and<00:00:46.559> I<00:00:47.280> can<00:00:47.430> go<00:00:47.579> into

00:00:47.750 --> 00:00:47.760 
this joint chain and I can go into

00:00:47.760 --> 00:00:50.029 
this joint chain and I can go into
interactive<00:00:48.120> playback<00:00:48.870> mode<00:00:49.110> now<00:00:49.649> while<00:00:49.890> I'm

00:00:50.029 --> 00:00:50.039 
interactive playback mode now while I'm

00:00:50.039 --> 00:00:51.529 
interactive playback mode now while I'm
an<00:00:50.160> interactive<00:00:50.640> playback<00:00:51.000> mode<00:00:51.210> I<00:00:51.390> can

00:00:51.529 --> 00:00:51.539 
an interactive playback mode I can

00:00:51.539 --> 00:00:54.170 
an interactive playback mode I can
actually<00:00:51.690> use<00:00:52.110> my<00:00:52.140> transform<00:00:53.039> or<00:00:53.250> rotate

00:00:54.170 --> 00:00:54.180 
actually use my transform or rotate

00:00:54.180 --> 00:00:56.630 
actually use my transform or rotate
manipulators<00:00:54.809> to<00:00:55.350> test<00:00:55.770> the<00:00:56.039> behavior<00:00:56.489> of

00:00:56.630 --> 00:00:56.640 
manipulators to test the behavior of

00:00:56.640 --> 00:00:59.270 
manipulators to test the behavior of
this<00:00:57.210> dynamic<00:00:57.449> chain<00:00:57.960> so<00:00:58.649> for<00:00:58.859> instance<00:00:59.129> if<00:00:59.219> I

00:00:59.270 --> 00:00:59.280 
this dynamic chain so for instance if I

00:00:59.280 --> 00:01:01.010 
this dynamic chain so for instance if I
go<00:00:59.309> into<00:00:59.550> rotate<00:00:59.969> mode<00:01:00.180> I<00:01:00.420> can<00:01:00.870> actually

00:01:01.010 --> 00:01:01.020 
go into rotate mode I can actually

00:01:01.020 --> 00:01:03.170 
go into rotate mode I can actually
rotate<00:01:01.379> this<00:01:01.800> as<00:01:02.039> though<00:01:02.340> it<00:01:02.520> were<00:01:02.670> something

00:01:03.170 --> 00:01:03.180 
rotate this as though it were something

00:01:03.180 --> 00:01:05.780 
rotate this as though it were something
like<00:01:03.210> a<00:01:03.329> tail<00:01:03.719> or<00:01:04.049> a<00:01:04.320> ponytail<00:01:04.769> on<00:01:05.159> a<00:01:05.220> character

00:01:05.780 --> 00:01:05.790 
like a tail or a ponytail on a character

00:01:05.790 --> 00:01:08.270 
like a tail or a ponytail on a character
so<00:01:06.780> this<00:01:06.960> is<00:01:07.110> the<00:01:07.229> basic<00:01:07.650> behavior<00:01:08.130> I<00:01:08.159> would

00:01:08.270 --> 00:01:08.280 
so this is the basic behavior I would

00:01:08.280 --> 00:01:11.450 
so this is the basic behavior I would
get<00:01:08.580> if<00:01:09.180> I<00:01:09.270> wanted<00:01:09.510> to<00:01:09.689> refine<00:01:10.200> this<00:01:10.590> I<00:01:10.830> can

00:01:11.450 --> 00:01:11.460 
get if I wanted to refine this I can

00:01:11.460 --> 00:01:14.210 
get if I wanted to refine this I can
actually<00:01:11.490> go<00:01:12.030> in<00:01:12.240> grab<00:01:13.080> the<00:01:13.320> handle<00:01:13.799> here<00:01:14.070> and

00:01:14.210 --> 00:01:14.220 
actually go in grab the handle here and

00:01:14.220 --> 00:01:16.310 
actually go in grab the handle here and
it<00:01:14.939> will<00:01:15.119> give<00:01:15.390> me<00:01:15.420> a<00:01:15.540> series<00:01:15.990> of<00:01:16.140> parameters

00:01:16.310 --> 00:01:16.320 
it will give me a series of parameters

00:01:16.320 --> 00:01:18.170 
it will give me a series of parameters
that<00:01:16.710> control<00:01:16.799> things<00:01:17.280> like<00:01:17.369> the<00:01:17.640> stiffness

00:01:18.170 --> 00:01:18.180 
that control things like the stiffness

00:01:18.180 --> 00:01:20.420 
that control things like the stiffness
the<00:01:18.630> amount<00:01:18.930> of<00:01:19.020> gravity<00:01:19.560> damping<00:01:20.340> and

00:01:20.420 --> 00:01:20.430 
the amount of gravity damping and

00:01:20.430 --> 00:01:22.789 
the amount of gravity damping and
friction<00:01:20.880> so<00:01:21.509> for<00:01:21.780> instance<00:01:22.110> if<00:01:22.259> I<00:01:22.380> give<00:01:22.560> this

00:01:22.789 --> 00:01:22.799 
friction so for instance if I give this

00:01:22.799 --> 00:01:26.030 
friction so for instance if I give this
a<00:01:23.040> negative<00:01:23.909> gravity<00:01:24.479> and<00:01:24.659> I<00:01:25.229> go<00:01:25.380> back<00:01:25.619> in<00:01:25.890> and

00:01:26.030 --> 00:01:26.040 
a negative gravity and I go back in and

00:01:26.040 --> 00:01:29.450 
a negative gravity and I go back in and
push<00:01:26.189> play<00:01:26.400> as<00:01:26.810> I<00:01:27.810> give<00:01:28.020> this<00:01:28.259> a<00:01:28.650> negative

00:01:29.450 --> 00:01:29.460 
push play as I give this a negative

00:01:29.460 --> 00:01:32.210 
push play as I give this a negative
value<00:01:29.729> say<00:01:30.689> negative<00:01:31.079> five<00:01:31.380> then<00:01:31.979> that's

00:01:32.210 --> 00:01:32.220 
value say negative five then that's

00:01:32.220 --> 00:01:34.670 
value say negative five then that's
going<00:01:32.340> to<00:01:32.400> behave<00:01:32.729> more<00:01:32.970> like<00:01:33.000> a<00:01:33.150> balloon<00:01:33.680> so

00:01:34.670 --> 00:01:34.680 
going to behave more like a balloon so

00:01:34.680 --> 00:01:36.920 
going to behave more like a balloon so
if<00:01:34.770> I<00:01:34.890> go<00:01:35.040> back<00:01:35.070> in<00:01:35.579> this<00:01:35.759> time<00:01:36.030> and<00:01:36.390> I<00:01:36.509> go<00:01:36.689> into

00:01:36.920 --> 00:01:36.930 
if I go back in this time and I go into

00:01:36.930 --> 00:01:39.679 
if I go back in this time and I go into
interactive<00:01:37.560> playback<00:01:38.280> mode<00:01:38.520> as<00:01:38.729> I<00:01:39.360> begin<00:01:39.630> to

00:01:39.679 --> 00:01:39.689 
interactive playback mode as I begin to

00:01:39.689 --> 00:01:41.990 
interactive playback mode as I begin to
test<00:01:39.960> this<00:01:40.170> behavior<00:01:40.680> you<00:01:40.710> can<00:01:40.950> see<00:01:41.189> now<00:01:41.400> it's

00:01:41.990 --> 00:01:42.000 
test this behavior you can see now it's

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:44.450 
test this behavior you can see now it's
behaving<00:01:42.390> more<00:01:42.720> like<00:01:42.780> a<00:01:42.960> balloon<00:01:43.409> and<00:01:43.770> less

00:01:44.450 --> 00:01:44.460 
behaving more like a balloon and less

00:01:44.460 --> 00:01:46.429 
behaving more like a balloon and less
like<00:01:44.700> a<00:01:44.729> tail<00:01:45.060> because<00:01:45.509> the<00:01:45.930> gravity<00:01:46.350> is

00:01:46.429 --> 00:01:46.439 
like a tail because the gravity is

00:01:46.439 --> 00:01:50.420 
like a tail because the gravity is
actually<00:01:46.740> pulling<00:01:47.040> it<00:01:47.220> upward<00:01:49.009> so<00:01:50.009> using<00:01:50.369> a

00:01:50.420 --> 00:01:50.430 
actually pulling it upward so using a

00:01:50.430 --> 00:01:53.480 
actually pulling it upward so using a
practical<00:01:50.939> example<00:01:51.030> we<00:01:51.600> use<00:01:51.780> this<00:01:52.020> ork<00:01:52.799> zombie

00:01:53.480 --> 00:01:53.490 
practical example we use this ork zombie

00:01:53.490 --> 00:01:55.039 
practical example we use this ork zombie
character<00:01:53.880> which<00:01:54.030> is<00:01:54.180> carrying<00:01:54.540> a<00:01:54.689> chain

00:01:55.039 --> 00:01:55.049 
character which is carrying a chain

00:01:55.049 --> 00:01:56.270 
character which is carrying a chain
they're<00:01:55.439> just<00:01:55.590> going<00:01:55.710> to<00:01:55.770> attack<00:01:56.040> somebody

00:01:56.270 --> 00:01:56.280 
they're just going to attack somebody

00:01:56.280 --> 00:01:58.100 
they're just going to attack somebody
with<00:01:56.579> and<00:01:56.790> if<00:01:56.850> I<00:01:56.909> play<00:01:57.119> this<00:01:57.299> you<00:01:57.840> can<00:01:57.960> see

00:01:58.100 --> 00:01:58.110 
with and if I play this you can see

00:01:58.110 --> 00:02:00.230 
with and if I play this you can see
that's<00:01:58.320> just<00:01:58.409> a<00:01:58.619> rigid<00:01:59.100> kind<00:01:59.430> of<00:01:59.520> static<00:01:59.939> chain

00:02:00.230 --> 00:02:00.240 
that's just a rigid kind of static chain

00:02:00.240 --> 00:02:02.810 
that's just a rigid kind of static chain
with<00:02:00.479> no<00:02:00.509> motion<00:02:01.189> so<00:02:02.189> I'll<00:02:02.310> rewind<00:02:02.670> to<00:02:02.790> the

00:02:02.810 --> 00:02:02.820 
with no motion so I'll rewind to the

00:02:02.820 --> 00:02:04.880 
with no motion so I'll rewind to the
beginning<00:02:02.969> of<00:02:03.299> my<00:02:03.479> animation<00:02:04.020> I'll<00:02:04.350> grab<00:02:04.619> the

00:02:04.880 --> 00:02:04.890 
beginning of my animation I'll grab the

00:02:04.890 --> 00:02:07.190 
beginning of my animation I'll grab the
base<00:02:05.369> of<00:02:05.700> the<00:02:05.820> chain<00:02:06.090> and<00:02:06.329> shift<00:02:06.689> select<00:02:06.990> the

00:02:07.190 --> 00:02:07.200 
base of the chain and shift select the

00:02:07.200 --> 00:02:09.650 
base of the chain and shift select the
end<00:02:07.409> effector<00:02:07.920> of<00:02:07.950> the<00:02:08.099> chain<00:02:08.369> and<00:02:08.610> I'll<00:02:09.450> once

00:02:09.650 --> 00:02:09.660 
end effector of the chain and I'll once

00:02:09.660 --> 00:02:12.170 
end effector of the chain and I'll once
again<00:02:09.810> apply<00:02:10.440> a<00:02:10.739> hair<00:02:11.009> dynamic<00:02:11.550> to<00:02:11.700> that

00:02:12.170 --> 00:02:12.180 
again apply a hair dynamic to that

00:02:12.180 --> 00:02:14.179 
again apply a hair dynamic to that
now<00:02:12.720> when<00:02:12.900> I<00:02:12.930> play<00:02:13.049> this<00:02:13.319> back<00:02:13.620> you<00:02:13.890> can<00:02:14.010> see

00:02:14.179 --> 00:02:14.189 
now when I play this back you can see

00:02:14.189 --> 00:02:16.460 
now when I play this back you can see
the<00:02:14.340> chain<00:02:14.640> does<00:02:14.970> indeed<00:02:15.269> react<00:02:15.780> with

00:02:16.460 --> 00:02:16.470 
the chain does indeed react with

00:02:16.470 --> 00:02:20.059 
the chain does indeed react with
secondary<00:02:17.189> emotion<00:02:18.140> using<00:02:19.140> the<00:02:19.260> same<00:02:19.500> tool<00:02:19.799> we

00:02:20.059 --> 00:02:20.069 
secondary emotion using the same tool we

00:02:20.069 --> 00:02:21.710 
secondary emotion using the same tool we
can<00:02:20.189> also<00:02:20.340> create<00:02:20.790> a<00:02:20.819> series<00:02:21.390> of<00:02:21.540> dynamic

00:02:21.710 --> 00:02:21.720 
can also create a series of dynamic

00:02:21.720 --> 00:02:23.750 
can also create a series of dynamic
chains<00:02:22.379> if<00:02:22.680> we<00:02:22.769> wanted<00:02:23.010> to<00:02:23.069> create<00:02:23.400> more<00:02:23.579> of<00:02:23.640> a

00:02:23.750 --> 00:02:23.760 
chains if we wanted to create more of a

00:02:23.760 --> 00:02:25.699 
chains if we wanted to create more of a
panel<00:02:24.239> effect<00:02:24.569> so<00:02:24.989> here<00:02:25.140> you<00:02:25.230> can<00:02:25.349> see<00:02:25.530> I<00:02:25.560> have

00:02:25.699 --> 00:02:25.709 
panel effect so here you can see I have

00:02:25.709 --> 00:02:27.710 
panel effect so here you can see I have
this<00:02:25.799> creature<00:02:26.159> carrying<00:02:26.939> a<00:02:27.000> flag<00:02:27.360> in<00:02:27.569> its

00:02:27.710 --> 00:02:27.720 
this creature carrying a flag in its

00:02:27.720 --> 00:02:30.229 
this creature carrying a flag in its
mouth<00:02:27.930> if<00:02:28.230> I<00:02:28.319> actually<00:02:28.709> hide<00:02:29.459> the<00:02:29.670> skeleton

00:02:30.229 --> 00:02:30.239 
mouth if I actually hide the skeleton

00:02:30.239 --> 00:02:32.839 
mouth if I actually hide the skeleton
here<00:02:30.510> you<00:02:31.500> can<00:02:31.680> actually<00:02:31.890> see<00:02:32.430> there<00:02:32.640> that

00:02:32.839 --> 00:02:32.849 
here you can actually see there that

00:02:32.849 --> 00:02:35.000 
here you can actually see there that
character<00:02:33.569> is<00:02:33.659> indeed<00:02:33.989> moving<00:02:34.290> and<00:02:34.530> deforming

00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:35.010 
character is indeed moving and deforming

00:02:35.010 --> 00:02:36.830 
character is indeed moving and deforming
but<00:02:35.220> the<00:02:35.430> flag<00:02:35.819> that's<00:02:36.090> in<00:02:36.239> his<00:02:36.359> mouth<00:02:36.569> is<00:02:36.810> just

00:02:36.830 --> 00:02:36.840 
but the flag that's in his mouth is just

00:02:36.840 --> 00:02:39.289 
but the flag that's in his mouth is just
very<00:02:37.260> rigid<00:02:37.709> so<00:02:38.370> I'm<00:02:38.459> going<00:02:38.579> to<00:02:38.609> rewind<00:02:39.060> this

00:02:39.289 --> 00:02:39.299 
very rigid so I'm going to rewind this

00:02:39.299 --> 00:02:42.500 
very rigid so I'm going to rewind this
and<00:02:39.569> I'm<00:02:39.870> going<00:02:40.140> to<00:02:40.200> select<00:02:41.010> the<00:02:41.400> joint<00:02:42.180> chains

00:02:42.500 --> 00:02:42.510 
and I'm going to select the joint chains

00:02:42.510 --> 00:02:49.129 
and I'm going to select the joint chains
in<00:02:42.780> order<00:02:43.079> 1<00:02:43.319> 2<00:02:43.769> 3<00:02:44.989> 4<00:02:45.989> &amp;<00:02:46.409> 5<00:02:47.510> now<00:02:48.510> I'm<00:02:48.659> going<00:02:48.900> to<00:02:48.989> go

00:02:49.129 --> 00:02:49.139 
in order 1 2 3 4 &amp; 5 now I'm going to go

00:02:49.139 --> 00:02:52.940 
in order 1 2 3 4 &amp; 5 now I'm going to go
in<00:02:49.349> and<00:02:49.680> apply<00:02:50.099> instead<00:02:50.519> of<00:02:50.790> a<00:02:51.000> hair<00:02:51.560> where<00:02:52.560> the

00:02:52.940 --> 00:02:52.950 
in and apply instead of a hair where the

00:02:52.950 --> 00:02:54.830 
in and apply instead of a hair where the
driver<00:02:53.489> I'm<00:02:53.700> going<00:02:53.849> to<00:02:53.940> try<00:02:54.209> to<00:02:54.269> apply<00:02:54.750> a

00:02:54.830 --> 00:02:54.840 
driver I'm going to try to apply a

00:02:54.840 --> 00:02:58.280 
driver I'm going to try to apply a
multi-chain<00:02:55.739> in<00:02:55.950> cloth<00:02:56.480> so<00:02:57.480> with<00:02:57.689> this<00:02:57.930> I<00:02:58.139> have

00:02:58.280 --> 00:02:58.290 
multi-chain in cloth so with this I have

00:02:58.290 --> 00:02:59.869 
multi-chain in cloth so with this I have
a<00:02:58.319> couple<00:02:58.620> of<00:02:58.739> options<00:02:59.159> I<00:02:59.280> can<00:02:59.340> use<00:02:59.579> stretch

00:02:59.869 --> 00:02:59.879 
a couple of options I can use stretch

00:02:59.879 --> 00:03:02.449 
a couple of options I can use stretch
gik<00:03:00.209> I<00:03:00.450> can<00:03:00.810> use<00:03:00.989> per<00:03:01.319> joint<00:03:01.590> I<00:03:01.680> K<00:03:01.920> or<00:03:02.129> I<00:03:02.159> can<00:03:02.430> use

00:03:02.449 --> 00:03:02.459 
gik I can use per joint I K or I can use

00:03:02.459 --> 00:03:04.460 
gik I can use per joint I K or I can use
spline<00:03:03.180> I<00:03:03.359> K<00:03:03.420> so<00:03:03.659> I'll<00:03:03.930> start<00:03:04.200> with<00:03:04.319> the

00:03:04.460 --> 00:03:04.470 
spline I K so I'll start with the

00:03:04.470 --> 00:03:06.410 
spline I K so I'll start with the
default<00:03:04.590> method<00:03:05.189> and<00:03:05.340> I'll<00:03:05.730> simply<00:03:06.120> apply

00:03:06.410 --> 00:03:06.420 
default method and I'll simply apply

00:03:06.420 --> 00:03:09.440 
default method and I'll simply apply
that<00:03:07.220> now<00:03:08.220> I<00:03:08.250> have<00:03:08.340> the<00:03:08.579> option<00:03:08.730> also<00:03:09.150> of

00:03:09.440 --> 00:03:09.450 
that now I have the option also of

00:03:09.450 --> 00:03:11.089 
that now I have the option also of
colliding<00:03:10.079> for<00:03:10.290> instance<00:03:10.590> if<00:03:10.709> I<00:03:10.769> want<00:03:10.980> the

00:03:11.089 --> 00:03:11.099 
colliding for instance if I want the

00:03:11.099 --> 00:03:13.309 
colliding for instance if I want the
cloth<00:03:11.370> to<00:03:11.670> collide<00:03:12.030> with<00:03:12.299> his<00:03:12.450> foot<00:03:12.780> for<00:03:13.200> now

00:03:13.309 --> 00:03:13.319 
cloth to collide with his foot for now

00:03:13.319 --> 00:03:15.170 
cloth to collide with his foot for now
I'll<00:03:13.560> just<00:03:13.590> set<00:03:13.950> it<00:03:14.069> to<00:03:14.099> no<00:03:14.400> collisions<00:03:14.970> you

00:03:15.170 --> 00:03:15.180 
I'll just set it to no collisions you

00:03:15.180 --> 00:03:18.110 
I'll just set it to no collisions you
can<00:03:15.989> also<00:03:16.139> see<00:03:16.560> here<00:03:16.859> that<00:03:17.040> I<00:03:17.099> get<00:03:17.370> a<00:03:17.579> grayscale

00:03:18.110 --> 00:03:18.120 
can also see here that I get a grayscale

00:03:18.120 --> 00:03:20.869 
can also see here that I get a grayscale
representation<00:03:18.900> of<00:03:19.049> the<00:03:19.470> fall-off<00:03:19.739> so<00:03:20.669> that<00:03:20.849> I

00:03:20.869 --> 00:03:20.879 
representation of the fall-off so that I

00:03:20.879 --> 00:03:23.720 
representation of the fall-off so that I
can<00:03:21.090> actually<00:03:21.540> control<00:03:22.349> how<00:03:22.410> much<00:03:23.010> influence

00:03:23.720 --> 00:03:23.730 
can actually control how much influence

00:03:23.730 --> 00:03:26.900 
can actually control how much influence
the<00:03:24.690> dynamics<00:03:25.290> have<00:03:25.949> over<00:03:26.250> the<00:03:26.400> length<00:03:26.609> of<00:03:26.819> the

00:03:26.900 --> 00:03:26.910 
the dynamics have over the length of the

00:03:26.910 --> 00:03:29.449 
the dynamics have over the length of the
chain<00:03:27.260> now<00:03:28.260> when<00:03:28.409> I<00:03:28.440> play<00:03:28.650> this<00:03:28.799> back<00:03:29.069> what

00:03:29.449 --> 00:03:29.459 
chain now when I play this back what

00:03:29.459 --> 00:03:31.879 
chain now when I play this back what
you'll<00:03:29.579> see<00:03:29.819> is<00:03:30.150> a<00:03:30.419> dynamic<00:03:31.019> object<00:03:31.530> that<00:03:31.709> will

00:03:31.879 --> 00:03:31.889 
you'll see is a dynamic object that will

00:03:31.889 --> 00:03:34.220 
you'll see is a dynamic object that will
react<00:03:32.430> to<00:03:32.819> the<00:03:32.940> environment<00:03:33.569> around<00:03:33.690> it<00:03:34.049> or

00:03:34.220 --> 00:03:34.230 
react to the environment around it or

00:03:34.230 --> 00:03:36.439 
react to the environment around it or
rather<00:03:34.470> it<00:03:34.769> will<00:03:34.949> react<00:03:35.190> to<00:03:35.280> the<00:03:35.430> motion<00:03:35.879> but

00:03:36.439 --> 00:03:36.449 
rather it will react to the motion but

00:03:36.449 --> 00:03:38.539 
rather it will react to the motion but
it's<00:03:36.629> not<00:03:36.810> currently<00:03:37.530> reacting<00:03:38.280> to<00:03:38.459> the

00:03:38.539 --> 00:03:38.549 
it's not currently reacting to the

00:03:38.549 --> 00:03:41.119 
it's not currently reacting to the
environment<00:03:39.319> the<00:03:40.319> properties<00:03:40.859> of<00:03:40.889> the

00:03:41.119 --> 00:03:41.129 
environment the properties of the

00:03:41.129 --> 00:03:43.430 
environment the properties of the
dynamic<00:03:41.519> object<00:03:41.940> can<00:03:42.120> be<00:03:42.269> edited<00:03:42.479> as<00:03:42.840> well<00:03:43.109> so

00:03:43.430 --> 00:03:43.440 
dynamic object can be edited as well so

00:03:43.440 --> 00:03:45.500 
dynamic object can be edited as well so
if<00:03:43.560> we<00:03:43.709> select<00:03:44.069> it<00:03:44.280> you<00:03:44.430> can<00:03:44.459> see<00:03:44.609> it<00:03:45.060> becomes<00:03:45.239> a

00:03:45.500 --> 00:03:45.510 
if we select it you can see it becomes a

00:03:45.510 --> 00:03:47.599 
if we select it you can see it becomes a
cloth<00:03:45.720> object<00:03:46.169> in<00:03:46.260> the<00:03:46.379> attribute<00:03:46.889> editor<00:03:46.919> and

00:03:47.599 --> 00:03:47.609 
cloth object in the attribute editor and

00:03:47.609 --> 00:03:49.789 
cloth object in the attribute editor and
I<00:03:47.699> can<00:03:47.849> apply<00:03:48.060> a<00:03:48.150> given<00:03:48.510> preset<00:03:49.019> to<00:03:49.139> this<00:03:49.319> for

00:03:49.789 --> 00:03:49.799 
I can apply a given preset to this for

00:03:49.799 --> 00:03:52.280 
I can apply a given preset to this for
instance<00:03:50.010> I<00:03:50.250> can<00:03:50.430> make<00:03:50.639> this<00:03:50.849> a<00:03:51.290> stretchy

00:03:52.280 --> 00:03:52.290 
instance I can make this a stretchy

00:03:52.290 --> 00:03:54.710 
instance I can make this a stretchy
material<00:03:52.470> like<00:03:53.220> a<00:03:53.250> rubber<00:03:53.579> sheet<00:03:53.669> so<00:03:54.540> I'll

00:03:54.710 --> 00:03:54.720 
material like a rubber sheet so I'll

00:03:54.720 --> 00:03:57.259 
material like a rubber sheet so I'll
apply<00:03:55.019> that<00:03:55.470> and<00:03:55.739> now<00:03:56.400> when<00:03:56.579> I<00:03:56.609> play<00:03:56.849> this<00:03:56.970> back

00:03:57.259 --> 00:03:57.269 
apply that and now when I play this back

00:03:57.269 --> 00:04:00.020 
apply that and now when I play this back
I'll<00:03:57.900> get<00:03:58.049> a<00:03:58.109> much<00:03:58.379> stretchy<00:03:59.040> or<00:03:59.310> behavior<00:03:59.849> in

00:04:00.020 --> 00:04:00.030 
I'll get a much stretchy or behavior in

00:04:00.030 --> 00:04:02.089 
I'll get a much stretchy or behavior in
the<00:04:00.599> cloth<00:04:00.870> now<00:04:01.199> you<00:04:01.260> can<00:04:01.440> see<00:04:01.620> actually<00:04:02.069> that

00:04:02.089 --> 00:04:02.099 
the cloth now you can see actually that

00:04:02.099 --> 00:04:04.189 
the cloth now you can see actually that
steps<00:04:02.579> on<00:04:02.790> it<00:04:02.819> and<00:04:03.090> stretches<00:04:03.629> it<00:04:03.780> out<00:04:03.900> and

00:04:04.189 --> 00:04:04.199 
steps on it and stretches it out and

00:04:04.199 --> 00:04:07.250 
steps on it and stretches it out and
then<00:04:04.290> it<00:04:04.409> releases<00:04:04.739> and<00:04:05.159> and<00:04:05.720> kind<00:04:06.720> of<00:04:06.780> expands

00:04:07.250 --> 00:04:07.260 
then it releases and and kind of expands

00:04:07.260 --> 00:04:09.860 
then it releases and and kind of expands
and<00:04:07.470> contracts<00:04:07.859> like<00:04:08.069> elastic<00:04:08.870> ultimately

00:04:09.860 --> 00:04:09.870 
and contracts like elastic ultimately

00:04:09.870 --> 00:04:12.800 
and contracts like elastic ultimately
after<00:04:10.229> refining<00:04:10.620> the<00:04:11.010> behavior<00:04:11.579> I<00:04:11.790> can<00:04:12.239> bake

00:04:12.800 --> 00:04:12.810 
after refining the behavior I can bake

00:04:12.810 --> 00:04:15.229 
after refining the behavior I can bake
out<00:04:13.049> the<00:04:13.409> animation<00:04:13.889> the<00:04:14.400> dynamic<00:04:14.879> animation

00:04:15.229 --> 00:04:15.239 
out the animation the dynamic animation

00:04:15.239 --> 00:04:18.560 
out the animation the dynamic animation
as<00:04:15.540> either<00:04:15.900> a<00:04:16.109> cache<00:04:16.769> or<00:04:17.190> I<00:04:17.250> can<00:04:18.030> actually<00:04:18.329> bake

00:04:18.560 --> 00:04:18.570 
as either a cache or I can actually bake

00:04:18.570 --> 00:04:21.080 
as either a cache or I can actually bake
it<00:04:18.750> out<00:04:18.900> to<00:04:19.409> the<00:04:19.620> joints<00:04:20.130> so<00:04:20.279> that<00:04:20.609> the<00:04:20.729> joints

00:04:21.080 --> 00:04:21.090 
it out to the joints so that the joints

00:04:21.090 --> 00:04:22.879 
it out to the joints so that the joints
will<00:04:21.239> just<00:04:21.419> have<00:04:21.570> basic<00:04:21.810> keyframes<00:04:22.500> on<00:04:22.740> them

00:04:22.879 --> 00:04:22.889 
will just have basic keyframes on them

00:04:22.889 --> 00:04:25.370 
will just have basic keyframes on them
in<00:04:23.039> the<00:04:23.250> case<00:04:23.460> of<00:04:23.789> potentially<00:04:24.630> exporting<00:04:25.289> it

00:04:25.370 --> 00:04:25.380 
in the case of potentially exporting it

00:04:25.380 --> 00:04:25.910 
in the case of potentially exporting it
to<00:04:25.409> an<00:04:25.650> in

00:04:25.910 --> 00:04:25.920

00:04:29.390 --> 00:04:29.400 
for instance for game here you can see

00:04:29.400 --> 00:04:32.240
