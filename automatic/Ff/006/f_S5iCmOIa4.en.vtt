00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.859
 my favorite book of life in 1984 

00:00:03.899 --> 00:00:16.949
 People love and hate this book, I 'm 

00:00:07.859 --> 00:00:19.260
 good start is our lady of abbey 

00:00:16.949 --> 00:00:20.130
 Let's talk a little, sit down there. 

00:00:19.260 --> 00:00:21.660
 come history 

00:00:20.130 --> 00:00:23.789
 I was seeing those days. 

00:00:21.660 --> 00:00:26.039
 comments on the channel and a 

00:00:23.789 --> 00:00:27.500
 comment on my purchase video of the 

00:00:26.039 --> 00:00:30.330
 stars that was more or less like this 

00:00:27.500 --> 00:00:32.070
 I want to have you, it's ridiculous, you think 

00:00:30.330 --> 00:00:35.340
 Who are you to speak ill of the guilt of 

00:00:32.070 --> 00:00:37.110
 stars is if you do not like people 

00:00:35.340 --> 00:00:40.350
 what do you like then if you do not like 

00:00:37.110 --> 00:00:41.730
 respect as long as they see the 

00:00:40.350 --> 00:00:43.890
 video I'll leave the registration link 

00:00:41.730 --> 00:00:45.930
 this review you will see the 

00:00:43.890 --> 00:00:46.680
 comments on several of these titles 

00:00:45.930 --> 00:00:49.829
 paper too 

00:00:46.680 --> 00:00:51.719
 anyway , as I always get to reflect 

00:00:49.829 --> 00:00:53.670
 Your comments, because for more 

00:00:51.719 --> 00:00:55.590
 that he could not answer all his 

00:00:53.670 --> 00:00:57.750
 half of them with a lot of affection 

00:00:55.590 --> 00:01:01.859
 I used it if you reflect the things that you 

00:00:57.750 --> 00:01:03.350
 so write 99,999 new works as 

00:01:01.859 --> 00:01:05.369
 things are good positive things 

00:01:03.350 --> 00:01:08.220
 ingredient there is a small minority 

00:01:05.369 --> 00:01:10.979
 of comments that I can not define 

00:01:08.220 --> 00:01:12.750
 I truly think that the world needs 

00:01:10.979 --> 00:01:14.939
 negative reviews 

00:01:12.750 --> 00:01:16.049
 people need to listen to criticism 

00:01:14.939 --> 00:01:18.930
 negative 

00:01:16.049 --> 00:01:21.570
 they do, since these 

00:01:18.930 --> 00:01:25.229
 criticisms are based on arguments 

00:01:21.570 --> 00:01:28.560
 and consenting to have a Latin bird pass 

00:01:25.229 --> 00:01:31.470
 the piano bird precarizando do not know 

00:01:28.560 --> 00:01:35.130
 as in the world there is no unanimous opinion 

00:01:31.470 --> 00:01:37.020
 there is nothing that is unanimous has 

00:01:35.130 --> 00:01:39.000
 people who are in favor of evil have people who 

00:01:37.020 --> 00:01:40.079
 Nazi since she 'll kill you 

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:41.640
 nobody on the street 

00:01:40.079 --> 00:01:43.950
 There are people who are in favor of kicking. 

00:01:41.640 --> 00:01:47.070
 dog then there are people for everything 

00:01:43.950 --> 00:01:49.950
 there are opinions in favor of things 

00:01:47.070 --> 00:01:52.590
 there are opinions against things since 

00:01:49.950 --> 00:01:54.600
 that his opinion is oppressing nor 

00:01:52.590 --> 00:01:58.649
 interfering in anyone's life 

00:01:54.600 --> 00:02:00.689
 face, she expresses, she understands 

00:01:58.649 --> 00:02:03.930
 because your opinion is important and 

00:02:00.689 --> 00:02:06.700
 books that only have good points have books 

00:02:03.930 --> 00:02:10.090
 which only has bad points and has books 

00:02:06.700 --> 00:02:12.220
 good and bad that is the absolute majority 

00:02:10.090 --> 00:02:15.160
 what is happening is that people 

00:02:12.220 --> 00:02:16.660
 not learned that no one is obliged to 

00:02:15.160 --> 00:02:18.370
 like what you like 

00:02:16.660 --> 00:02:21.160
 people are different people 

00:02:18.370 --> 00:02:23.500
 like and dislike the same expensive book 

00:02:21.160 --> 00:02:25.630
 mine that stole books has 400 

00:02:23.500 --> 00:02:28.390
 people who love this book 400 people 

00:02:25.630 --> 00:02:29.080
 They hate this book and that's okay. 

00:02:28.390 --> 00:02:32.380
 face 

00:02:29.080 --> 00:02:34.810
 It's okay people could in the book not 

00:02:32.380 --> 00:02:36.519
 that the book is bad and that there is 

00:02:34.810 --> 00:02:39.190
 people the hand of this book does not mean 

00:02:36.519 --> 00:02:41.130
 that the book is good because being good or bad 

00:02:39.190 --> 00:02:42.519
 it's a very subjective question 

00:02:41.130 --> 00:02:43.840
 understood 

00:02:42.519 --> 00:02:45.370
 You can not speak that book is good. 

00:02:43.840 --> 00:02:46.150
 Can you speak this book is good for 

00:02:45.370 --> 00:02:48.310
 me 

00:02:46.150 --> 00:02:50.260
 This book is bad for me on my 

00:02:48.310 --> 00:02:52.450
 I found this opinion good book full of 

00:02:50.260 --> 00:02:54.280
 bathrooms I pass the channel only has 

00:02:52.450 --> 00:02:56.829
 people who do not understand what the 

00:02:54.280 --> 00:02:59.170
 function of a review to review a 

00:02:56.829 --> 00:03:01.390
 critical of a book if you do not know the 

00:02:59.170 --> 00:03:02.920
 review is you arrive and talk to 

00:03:01.390 --> 00:03:04.810
 story of the book the synopsis does not 

00:03:02.920 --> 00:03:07.090
 necessarily anyway like I do here 

00:03:04.810 --> 00:03:08.530
 on the channel you make history you talk 

00:03:07.090 --> 00:03:11.200
 after all if you speak the good points 

00:03:08.530 --> 00:03:14.260
 bad points what you liked and what kind 

00:03:11.200 --> 00:03:16.930
 Do you want a reflection when I do? 

00:03:14.260 --> 00:03:19.359
 a review is to expose mine 

00:03:16.930 --> 00:03:21.730
 Thoughts on this book understood 

00:03:19.359 --> 00:03:24.730
 be they good or bad 

00:03:21.730 --> 00:03:26.410
 I do not say that my God, who is a fan? 

00:03:24.730 --> 00:03:28.720
 from harry potter goes to hell who is a fan 

00:03:26.410 --> 00:03:30.790
 from harry potter has to close the 

00:03:28.720 --> 00:03:33.670
 harry potter fan saci are all 

00:03:30.790 --> 00:03:35.500
 mumbled, I do not say that, I do not 

00:03:33.670 --> 00:03:36.609
 I think people are just an example of me. 

00:03:35.500 --> 00:03:40.120
 I love harry potter with all my heart 

00:03:36.609 --> 00:03:42.609
 understood all my heart 

00:03:40.120 --> 00:03:44.859
 the person has the right to dislike 

00:03:42.609 --> 00:03:48.430
 something understood since she is 

00:03:44.859 --> 00:03:50.280
 Disrespecting you and that's the problem. 

00:03:48.430 --> 00:03:53.049
 You are not knowing how to differentiate. 

00:03:50.280 --> 00:03:56.200
 because the girl said it was a lack of 

00:03:53.049 --> 00:03:58.450
 respect I speak ill of a book missing 

00:03:56.200 --> 00:04:01.120
 respect to whom the lack of daughter 

00:03:58.450 --> 00:04:02.440
 respect with whom the author john is 

00:04:01.120 --> 00:04:04.690
 worry about what I saw that Spanish 

00:04:02.440 --> 00:04:08.349
 is talking about his is respect with 

00:04:04.690 --> 00:04:10.389
 Who liked people but who liked the 

00:04:08.349 --> 00:04:13.540
 be aware that there are people who do not 

00:04:10.389 --> 00:04:15.939
 Like me when I 'm talking, man. 

00:04:13.540 --> 00:04:17.030
 Negative points book by quota I liked it 

00:04:15.939 --> 00:04:20.120
 the cup of france 

00:04:17.030 --> 00:04:21.650
 the negative review when I say points 

00:04:20.120 --> 00:04:23.210
 of the book I'm not 

00:04:21.650 --> 00:04:24.830
 disrespecting the author 

00:04:23.210 --> 00:04:26.690
 I'm not disrespecting the non-publisher. 

00:04:24.830 --> 00:04:28.730
 It has the right not to run in respect 

00:04:26.690 --> 00:04:30.200
 publisher, much less everyone respecting 

00:04:28.730 --> 00:04:32.389
 Who liked I 'm using mine? 

00:04:30.200 --> 00:04:35.030
 freedom of speech to speak 

00:04:32.389 --> 00:04:38.960
 my review of this book and okay 

00:04:35.030 --> 00:04:41.120
 lied the day my favorite book face to 

00:04:38.960 --> 00:04:42.980

00:04:45.620 --> 00:04:51.800

00:04:48.500 --> 00:04:53.750
 I did not care, I gave a favorite. 

00:04:51.800 --> 00:04:56.060
 I do not care if you can honestly hate 

00:04:53.750 --> 00:04:58.430
 can love will not interfere with my 

00:04:56.060 --> 00:05:00.410
 opinion about it will not interfere with 

00:04:58.430 --> 00:05:03.110
 I do not think he's going to have him understand 

00:05:00.410 --> 00:05:06.080
 As I like him, you understand. 

00:05:03.110 --> 00:05:08.960
 you know if you do not know how to deal with 

00:05:06.080 --> 00:05:10.669
 contrary to the freedom of 

00:05:08.960 --> 00:05:13.070
 expression but not freedom of expression 

00:05:10.669 --> 00:05:15.020
 always remembering if you do not know how to deal 

00:05:13.070 --> 00:05:16.700
 with large opposites on the internet o 

00:05:15.020 --> 00:05:19.100
 world is no place for you 

00:05:16.700 --> 00:05:21.380
 sincerely because if you want 

00:05:19.100 --> 00:05:25.100
 everybody be like you 

00:05:21.380 --> 00:05:28.490
 ciccone is the cone sa that competed 

00:05:25.100 --> 00:05:30.500
 hurricane ciccone make a human cloning 

00:05:28.490 --> 00:05:34.100
 It's good everyone is just like you. 

00:05:30.500 --> 00:05:36.260
 expensive but if you have a gm tooth like gm 

00:05:34.100 --> 00:05:37.280
 tooth for a tooth with the same face will not 

00:05:36.260 --> 00:05:41.180
 be like you 

00:05:37.280 --> 00:05:44.330
 11 revelation by the girl spoke in 

00:05:41.180 --> 00:05:45.650
 comment if it's me bet you do not 

00:05:44.330 --> 00:05:48.760
 I wish you were talking about being 

00:05:45.650 --> 00:05:48.760
 favorite people 

00:05:50.890 --> 00:05:54.710
 pooped 

00:05:52.160 --> 00:05:57.110
 I even like to draw your books that 

00:05:54.710 --> 00:05:59.270
 I like to be from Switzerland. 

00:05:57.110 --> 00:06:01.940
 I had not noticed this is cool. 

00:05:59.270 --> 00:06:03.950
 to listen even though you knew it was cool 

00:06:01.940 --> 00:06:06.440
 hear contrary opinions because the 

00:06:03.950 --> 00:06:08.570
 world turns so I just managed to change 

00:06:06.440 --> 00:06:11.330
 several opinions I had in the past 

00:06:08.570 --> 00:06:14.330
 listening to contrary opinions 

00:06:11.330 --> 00:06:15.500
 then your only otherwise is is 

00:06:14.330 --> 00:06:17.330
 A lot of people have a great 

00:06:15.500 --> 00:06:18.560
 contrary communion instead 

00:06:17.330 --> 00:06:20.000
 I love the contrary opinion that is why 

00:06:18.560 --> 00:06:21.289
 I listen on the internet Cambodia by 

00:06:20.000 --> 00:06:23.240
 otherwise we will know what people 

00:06:21.289 --> 00:06:25.849
 are thinking with this bug we understand 

00:06:23.240 --> 00:06:27.889
 that what negative reviews are normal 

00:06:25.849 --> 00:06:30.379
 unstable no one is required 

00:06:27.889 --> 00:06:32.089
 to like what you like did not like 

00:06:30.379 --> 00:06:32.779
 Your favorite book is not about 

00:06:32.089 --> 00:06:36.379
 you 

00:06:32.779 --> 00:06:38.360
 and I think there is just and right reflection 

00:06:36.379 --> 00:06:40.610
 It does speak well of the books is 

00:06:38.360 --> 00:06:42.379
 respect to those who did not like it and speak ill 

00:06:40.610 --> 00:06:44.119
 respect zêzere with which you liked and have 

00:06:42.379 --> 00:06:48.259
 an opinion formed about having respect 

00:06:44.119 --> 00:06:50.240
 with whom you have not trained and the 

00:06:48.259 --> 00:06:52.009
 Speak here for the love of god you think 

00:06:50.240 --> 00:06:53.990
 I said so, henrique, are you? 

00:06:52.009 --> 00:06:56.179
 It's totally wrong to hear that you're 

00:06:53.990 --> 00:06:58.129
 totally right to hear that you're 

00:06:56.179 --> 00:07:00.080
 also wrong if you enjoyed a 

00:06:58.129 --> 00:07:01.999
