 drainage and I have delivered the dissemination of the 

00:00:08.860 --> 00:00:12.590
 destined to the quarter of water according to neighbors to date or in the urban mesh 

00:00:13.249 --> 00:00:16.949
 the path traveled by life rains a surface can topographically 

00:00:16.949 --> 00:00:20.679
 well defined or not after implementation of a city route 

00:00:20.679 --> 00:00:24.980
 strong in the passing passes determined by the route in June and finishes 

00:00:24.980 --> 00:00:27.980
 behaving quite differently from unhealthy behavior 

00:00:28.689 --> 00:00:33.879
 the correct management of these urban waters if only connected correct soil 

00:00:33.879 --> 00:00:37.570
 however, in most cities there is a proliferation of 

00:00:37.570 --> 00:00:39.060
 informal settlements 

00:00:39.060 --> 00:00:42.620
 high density of space occupation the removal of native vegetation cover 

00:00:42.620 --> 00:00:47.460
 occupation of risk areas waterproofing of soils lack of 

00:00:47.460 --> 00:00:51.020
 Qualified professionals preserving this planning the benefits 

00:00:51.020 --> 00:00:55.910
 and also humanization without penny structure, resulting in impacts on 

00:00:55.910 --> 00:00:57.510
 the population itself 

00:00:57.510 --> 00:01:01.020
 this continuous practice allied with other consequences 

00:01:01.020 --> 00:01:05.120
 disappearance of urban rivers because the pressure of space exploration 

00:01:05.120 --> 00:01:07.520
 I have not had sex with people disappear 

00:01:07.520 --> 00:01:10.600
 land covered by forests today only covered with asphalt 

00:01:11.100 --> 00:01:15.700
 an essential strategy for obtaining efficient solutions to 

00:01:15.700 --> 00:01:17.830
 preparation of master plans 

00:01:17.830 --> 00:01:22.060
 measures to increase these permeable profiles in 

00:01:22.060 --> 00:01:25.120
 urban areas are being seen as differentiated 

00:01:25.120 --> 00:01:27.750
 because they are measures that have enormous importance 

00:01:27.750 --> 00:01:32.080
 the recommendation is to seek alternative solutions that minimize 

00:01:32.080 --> 00:01:35.940
 we create solutions that allow the maximum possible 

00:01:35.940 --> 00:01:39.750
 infiltration points alternative solutions such as the use of 

00:01:39.750 --> 00:01:44.560
 porous floors serve to absorb the flow of water. 

00:01:44.560 --> 00:01:45.570
 reports 

00:01:45.570 --> 00:01:48.000
 thus avoiding the flood hostel 

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:52.090
 how to bring nothing on the slabs of the spread asked about rainwater 

00:01:52.090 --> 00:01:54.390
 decrease the amount below 

00:01:54.390 --> 00:01:59.050
 there is no ice appearing in any way that makes viscount of jequitinhonha even 

00:01:59.050 --> 00:02:00.830
 time to use the registration 

00:02:00.830 --> 00:02:05.370
 preserving the northern whales by minimizing 

00:02:05.370 --> 00:02:08.440
 as well as for the preservation of the ecosystem 

00:02:08.440 --> 00:02:11.659
 is the creation of recreation opportunity 

00:02:11.659 --> 00:02:15.250
 has fundamental importance in the process of sustainable urban drainage 

00:02:16.249 --> 00:02:20.549
 control of drainage at the source can be performed infiltration path and 

00:02:20.549 --> 00:02:23.549
 hot pervious floors type of cancer 

00:02:24.339 --> 00:02:26.119
 you can forget 

00:02:26.119 --> 00:02:31.049
 drainage system is not isolated from the various subsystems that constitute the 

00:02:31.049 --> 00:02:33.079
 organization of voting activities 

00:02:33.079 --> 00:02:35.429
 being part of a complex network 

00:02:35.429 --> 00:02:40.099
 and must therefore be articulated with the other subsystems 

00:02:40.099 --> 00:02:43.409
 Improvement of mind the name of complete and harmonious way 

00:02:43.409 --> 00:02:47.629
 the drainage already classified in two systems at merck london jenny a 

00:02:47.629 --> 00:02:48.899
 macrodrain 

00:02:48.899 --> 00:02:53.259
 the main function of the microdrainage system is to collect and how zé love 

00:02:53.259 --> 00:02:55.319
 high macrodrainage system 

00:02:55.319 --> 00:02:59.929
 in addition to removing rainwater from the pavement of public roads. 

00:02:59.929 --> 00:03:02.439
 flooding offers safety 

00:03:02.439 --> 00:03:07.840
 up to ten days and drivers avoid or reduce damage are traditionally 

00:03:07.839 --> 00:03:11.430
 men whose project is endowed with grapes produced by events 

00:03:11.430 --> 00:03:15.199
 with the 2 5 and a maximum of ten years time period 

00:03:15.819 --> 00:03:19.779
 are calculated to operate from predetermined limits 

00:03:19.779 --> 00:03:23.839
 the areas involved are mostly less than one square kilometer 100 

00:03:23.839 --> 00:03:25.299
 hectares 

00:03:25.299 --> 00:03:28.380
 chivu the blocks etc its tracing 

00:03:28.380 --> 00:03:32.660
 depending on the architecture the lubango or more distant the conduits depends 

00:03:32.660 --> 00:03:35.049
 of the designer and of the disposition of the rice 

00:03:35.049 --> 00:03:39.480
 the micro-drainage system is necessary to create conditions for 

00:03:39.479 --> 00:03:42.479
 operate vehicles and pedestrians in the mário covas 

00:03:43.149 --> 00:03:46.159
 occurrence of frequent rains being convenient 

00:03:46.159 --> 00:03:49.379
 system behavior for more intense rainfall 

00:03:49.979 --> 00:03:53.939
 we consider scotland to study the physical properties of human losses 

00:03:53.939 --> 00:03:56.939
 for making the thunderstorms stronger 

00:03:57.669 --> 00:04:02.089
 macrodrainage generally consisting of open or closed 

00:04:02.089 --> 00:04:03.269
 large dimensions 

00:04:03.269 --> 00:04:07.120
 projected for terms of 25 4 100 years of event period 

00:04:07.649 --> 00:04:11.109
 when we have adequate sanitation prevented us the freedom 

00:04:11.109 --> 00:04:15.489
 health and safety of the population and perversity is a consequence of 

00:04:15.489 --> 00:04:17.370
 direct or indirect key 

00:04:17.370 --> 00:04:22.230
 the macrodrainage works rectified the courses already torpedoed and the course 

00:04:22.229 --> 00:04:25.150
 be overcome by runoff 

00:04:25.150 --> 00:04:29.250
 the macrodrainage tracing obeys natural coruche routing 

00:04:29.250 --> 00:04:32.730
 aquatic hazare involved are mostly but three decorated rooms 

00:04:32.729 --> 00:04:36.470
 such as large catfish basins in Brazil 

00:04:36.470 --> 00:04:40.729
 micro-drainage infrastructure agents of municipal governments 

00:04:40.729 --> 00:04:44.010
 should have full responsibility for defining the actions of the sector 

00:04:44.599 --> 00:04:48.379
 extending this competence directions to the state governments 

00:04:48.379 --> 00:04:52.330
 as macro-drainage issues become more relevant 

00:04:52.330 --> 00:04:55.240
 fundamental reference for the planning of their basins. 

00:04:55.240 --> 00:04:57.930
 This is the responsibility of the 

00:04:57.930 --> 00:05:02.949
 the basic urban infrastructure service for micro-drainage 

00:05:02.949 --> 00:05:05.330
 and related services 

00:05:05.330 --> 00:05:06.320
 including 

00:05:06.320 --> 00:05:10.890
 earthworks guides gullies kaleri fluvial islands work paving 

00:05:10.890 --> 00:05:12.080
 containment 

00:05:12.080 --> 00:05:15.409
 to minimize risks to the occupation of the pope 

00:05:15.409 --> 00:05:19.919
 macro-drainage are known and critical situations caused by 

00:05:19.919 --> 00:05:24.239
 floods aggravated by the disorderly growth of cities in 

00:05:24.239 --> 00:05:27.400
 especially the occupation of floodplains and 

00:05:27.400 --> 00:05:30.660
 cities in public infrastructure in relation to 

00:05:30.660 --> 00:05:35.460
 drainage is insufficient microdrainage and macrodrainage system in brazil 

00:05:35.460 --> 00:05:39.039
 usually analyzed separately there are still cities 

00:05:39.039 --> 00:05:40.270
 phrases as a whole 

00:05:40.270 --> 00:05:43.589
 this causes problems in the interface of the two systems 

00:05:43.589 --> 00:05:47.279
 because often the grandmothers collected by the microdrainage 

00:05:47.279 --> 00:05:48.849
 directly the body of water 

00:05:48.849 --> 00:05:52.379
 with a speed greater than the birth rate we can not overload the system of 

00:05:52.379 --> 00:05:53.379
 macrodrain 

00:05:53.379 --> 00:05:57.900
 if it is not correctly sized or is the problem of 

00:05:57.899 --> 00:06:01.300
 drainage was not solved were only three children 

00:06:01.300 --> 00:06:05.539
 the problems to be overcome by half in the urban postures sedimentation 

00:06:05.539 --> 00:06:08.960
 of rivers flooding fill bowel nations is a health problem 

00:06:08.960 --> 00:06:11.569
 polluted water 

00:06:11.569 --> 00:06:15.539
 examples of problems caused by the precariousness of the drainage system 

00:06:15.539 --> 00:06:19.949
 The maracanã river runs alongside the cefet 

00:06:19.949 --> 00:06:22.550
 constantly suffers with us 

00:06:22.550 --> 00:06:26.550
 the regions near the river are flooded and the poetics of the heavy rain 

00:06:26.550 --> 00:06:30.890
 causing damage to the lives of students and workers in the region 

00:06:31.409 --> 00:06:35.209
 Another big problem is the proximity to the maracanã stadium. 

00:06:35.209 --> 00:06:39.550
 what will be the stage of the 2014 world cup final now imagine is in that 

00:06:39.550 --> 00:06:40.569
 scenario 

00:06:40.569 --> 00:06:45.169
 the end of the world cup the eyes of the world facing the rio de janeiro to 

00:06:45.169 --> 00:06:46.729
 I used to tag him 

00:06:46.729 --> 00:06:51.330
 and because of a rain are voters got completely flooded 

00:06:51.330 --> 00:06:55.030
 these issues led the government to enact the construction of four 

00:06:55.030 --> 00:06:55.940
 swimming pools 

00:06:55.940 --> 00:06:58.850
 of water storage located in the grajaú 

00:06:58.850 --> 00:07:01.460
 Tijuca, Isabella and the square of the flag 

00:07:01.460 --> 00:07:03.259
 therefore the wildcard 

00:07:03.259 --> 00:07:06.930
 feeding of the new times and the late birth of the plan 

00:07:06.930 --> 00:07:10.309
 and the maintenance of resources already used in drainage 

00:07:10.309 --> 00:07:13.539
 it is possible to improve the drainage system of the mantle of Brazil
