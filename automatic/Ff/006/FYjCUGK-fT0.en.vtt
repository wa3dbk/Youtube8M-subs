00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:17.000
 The Frank Lloyd Wright Living Room is designed to overlook Lake Minnetonka outside Minneapolis 

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:21.567
 The view of the lake can be seen from afar and enjoy the view of the sky from the windows of the room 

00:00:21.567 --> 00:00:27.266
 The room is surrounded by transparent walls that make you feel as if you are outdoors 

00:00:27.266 --> 00:00:31.834
 But with safety as if I were in a big tent in the forest, here I was first introduced to modernity 

00:00:31.834 --> 00:00:38.734
 And then became more appreciated 

00:00:38.734 --> 00:00:42.433
 When Wright moved to Europe, his designs were simple 

00:00:42.433 --> 00:00:45.500
 Chairs and tables do not have any decoration 

00:00:45.500 --> 00:00:54.634
 The goal was to make light wood. Wright took care of the lines and the edges, not the natural decoration 

00:00:54.634 --> 00:01:02.166
 This is the only room equipped with electricity from the redesigned historic rooms 

00:01:02.166 --> 00:01:08.000
 This is due to technological development 

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:13.367
 Here Wright's wife trained on the pianist in Cologne 

00:01:13.367 --> 00:01:18.700
 She was a really good pianoist; so she wanted to use the room for more than one purpose 

00:01:18.700 --> 00:01:23.433
 The room was for the family's living and entertainment, 

00:01:23.433 --> 00:01:30.367
 But the piano was always part of the room 

00:01:30.367 --> 00:01:37.334
 Wright's wife wanted to hold small parties behind it 

00:01:37.334 --> 00:01:44.734
 Room height may be 14 feet 

00:01:44.734 --> 00:01:50.533
 However the room looks low and horizontal 

00:01:50.533 --> 00:01:55.133
 The room area feels comfortable 

00:01:55.133 --> 00:01:58.133
 But it looks luxurious at the same time 

00:01:58.133 --> 00:02:08.467
 Wright works holes in each wall to try to get light from each direction 

00:02:08.467 --> 00:02:14.266
 Many believe that the room light comes from the sky but it is an industrial lighting system 

00:02:14.266 --> 00:02:18.334
 Wright deliberately made the living room a stand-alone suite 

00:02:18.334 --> 00:02:24.300
 The most important room in the house must have its own style. This is a country house that comes to rest 

00:02:24.300 --> 00:02:37.400
 The space does this in a way, it is a room that gives comfort, tranquility and tranquility 

00:02:37.400 --> 00:02:49.567
 I did not come across another room that gave me such calm, it was a masterpiece designed to live in
