00:00:18.620 --> 00:00:18.630 
MK 11 mod zeros Bianca relevant so

00:00:18.630 --> 00:00:21.560 
MK 11 mod zeros Bianca relevant so
basically<00:00:19.050> it's<00:00:19.289> a<00:00:19.680> semi-automatic<00:00:20.640> rifle<00:00:21.449> or

00:00:25.400 --> 00:00:25.410 
pretty much used as a sniper because

00:00:25.410 --> 00:00:27.339 
pretty much used as a sniper because
it's<00:00:25.590> just<00:00:25.710> got<00:00:26.160> the<00:00:26.279> dickless<00:00:26.550> range

00:00:27.339 --> 00:00:27.349 
it's just got the dickless range

00:00:27.349 --> 00:00:29.540 
it's just got the dickless range
basically<00:00:28.349> you'd<00:00:28.529> be<00:00:28.710> an<00:00:28.800> you<00:00:29.070> can<00:00:29.220> be<00:00:29.310> used<00:00:29.460> by

any class the uncle of mod a buffer for

00:00:31.529 --> 00:00:34.280 
any class the uncle of mod a buffer for
is<00:00:31.830> very<00:00:32.009> slimming<00:00:32.189> to<00:00:32.279> the<00:00:32.420> m39<00:00:33.420> both<00:00:33.960> range

00:00:34.280 --> 00:00:34.290 
is very slimming to the m39 both range

00:00:34.290 --> 00:00:36.440 
is very slimming to the m39 both range
after<00:00:34.620> seeing<00:00:34.800> all<00:00:34.860> the<00:00:34.980> performance<00:00:35.399> it<00:00:35.760> is

00:00:36.440 --> 00:00:36.450 
after seeing all the performance it is

00:00:36.450 --> 00:00:38.420 
after seeing all the performance it is
good<00:00:36.780> overall<00:00:37.140> for<00:00:37.410> sniper<00:00:37.649> rifle<00:00:38.070> Inge<00:00:38.219> and

00:00:38.420 --> 00:00:38.430 
good overall for sniper rifle Inge and

00:00:38.430 --> 00:00:40.760 
good overall for sniper rifle Inge and
offers<00:00:39.030> the<00:00:39.059> decent<00:00:39.540> performance<00:00:39.960> in<00:00:40.170> both

00:00:40.760 --> 00:00:40.770 
offers the decent performance in both

midtown<00:00:41.340> along<00:00:41.460> ring<00:00:42.500> so<00:00:43.500> it<00:00:44.100> is<00:00:44.460> essentially

00:00:44.840 --> 00:00:44.850 
midtown along ring so it is essentially

00:00:44.850 --> 00:00:46.729 
midtown along ring so it is essentially
an<00:00:45.059> m16<00:00:45.480> rifle<00:00:45.780> that's<00:00:45.930> been<00:00:46.110> chambered<00:00:46.710> for

an m16 rifle that's been chambered for

00:00:46.739 --> 00:00:51.950 
an m16 rifle that's been chambered for
the<00:00:46.980> larger<00:00:48.170> 7.2<00:00:49.550> 7.62<00:00:50.550> sorry<00:00:50.910> Malema<00:00:51.660> around

00:00:51.960 --> 00:00:53.689 
the larger 7.2 7.62 sorry Malema around
giving<00:00:52.260> it<00:00:52.379> much<00:00:52.680> more<00:00:52.920> range<00:00:53.100> and<00:00:53.340> power<00:00:53.430> is

00:00:53.689 --> 00:00:53.699 
giving it much more range and power is

00:00:53.699 --> 00:00:55.700 
giving it much more range and power is
coming<00:00:53.879> and<00:00:54.090> testing<00:00:54.390> for<00:00:54.510> the<00:00:54.570> USMC<00:00:54.960> it<00:00:55.590> was

00:00:55.700 --> 00:00:55.710 
coming and testing for the USMC it was

00:00:55.710 --> 00:00:56.990 
coming and testing for the USMC it was
first<00:00:55.890> pitched<00:00:56.160> in<00:00:56.280> battlefield<00:00:56.670> in<00:00:56.910> the

00:00:56.990 --> 00:00:57.000 
first pitched in battlefield in the

00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:02.209 
first pitched in battlefield in the
battlefield<00:00:57.270> 3<00:00:57.629> series<00:00:58.940> okay<00:01:00.620> the<00:01:01.620> MK<00:01:01.980> lever

00:01:02.209 --> 00:01:02.219 
battlefield 3 series okay the MK lever

00:01:02.219 --> 00:01:04.130 
battlefield 3 series okay the MK lever
mod<00:01:02.399> is<00:01:02.550> very<00:01:02.760> similar<00:01:03.000> to<00:01:03.120> the<00:01:03.210> n<00:01:03.359> 39<00:01:03.600> it<00:01:04.019> can

00:01:04.130 --> 00:01:04.140 
mod is very similar to the n 39 it can

00:01:04.140 --> 00:01:05.359 
mod is very similar to the n 39 it can
be<00:01:04.199> also<00:01:04.290> equipped<00:01:04.650> with<00:01:04.680> various<00:01:05.159> six

00:01:05.359 --> 00:01:05.369 
be also equipped with various six

00:01:05.369 --> 00:01:06.649 
be also equipped with various six
degrees<00:01:05.580> which<00:01:05.700> is<00:01:05.729> more<00:01:06.030> powerful<00:01:06.210> scopes

00:01:06.649 --> 00:01:06.659 
degrees which is more powerful scopes

00:01:06.659 --> 00:01:08.480 
degrees which is more powerful scopes
and<00:01:06.840> silences<00:01:07.320> the<00:01:07.770> standards<00:01:08.220> in<00:01:08.310> the<00:01:08.400> eight

00:01:08.480 --> 00:01:08.490 
and silences the standards in the eight

00:01:08.490 --> 00:01:11.090 
and silences the standards in the eight
times<00:01:08.850> so<00:01:09.600> the<00:01:10.560> reason<00:01:10.710> this<00:01:10.890> is<00:01:10.950> called

00:01:11.090 --> 00:01:11.100 
times so the reason this is called

00:01:11.100 --> 00:01:13.039 
times so the reason this is called
sliders<00:01:11.640> because<00:01:11.850> it<00:01:11.970> was<00:01:12.240> actually<00:01:12.600> a<00:01:12.630> sniper

00:01:13.039 --> 00:01:13.049 
sliders because it was actually a sniper

00:01:13.049 --> 00:01:16.100 
sliders because it was actually a sniper
in<00:01:13.229> battlefield<00:01:14.040> 3<00:01:14.220> and<00:01:14.939> it's<00:01:15.450> basically<00:01:15.689> one

00:01:16.100 --> 00:01:16.110 
in battlefield 3 and it's basically one

00:01:16.110 --> 00:01:19.429 
in battlefield 3 and it's basically one
in<00:01:16.470> Ralphie<00:01:17.040> or<00:01:17.159> four<00:01:17.869> used<00:01:18.869> to<00:01:18.990> connect<00:01:19.290> I'm

00:01:19.429 --> 00:01:19.439 
in Ralphie or four used to connect I'm

00:01:19.439 --> 00:01:21.140 
in Ralphie or four used to connect I'm
scope<00:01:19.740> on<00:01:19.920> that<00:01:20.070> bad<00:01:20.340> boy<00:01:20.369> and<00:01:20.939> you're<00:01:21.030> gonna

pretty decent going that's semi or Mac

00:01:24.570 --> 00:01:26.899 
pretty decent going that's semi or Mac
and<00:01:25.020> you<00:01:25.080> can<00:01:25.290> run<00:01:25.470> around<00:01:25.590> with<00:01:26.130> it<00:01:26.280> same<00:01:26.670> time

and you can run around with it same time

00:01:26.909 --> 00:01:28.340 
and you can run around with it same time
because<00:01:27.299> it's<00:01:27.450> also<00:01:27.570> very<00:01:27.840> good<00:01:28.049> mid-range

00:01:28.340 --> 00:01:28.350 
because it's also very good mid-range

00:01:28.350 --> 00:01:30.140 
because it's also very good mid-range
because<00:01:29.040> it's<00:01:29.220> in<00:01:29.340> your<00:01:29.520> life<00:01:29.640> but<00:01:29.850> it<00:01:29.939> can<00:01:30.060> be

which<00:02:05.869> is<00:02:06.869> a<00:02:06.930> lot<00:02:07.310> but<00:02:08.310> it's<00:02:09.300> not<00:02:09.599> that<00:02:09.929> much<00:02:09.959> I

00:02:10.880 --> 00:02:10.890 
which is a lot but it's not that much I

00:02:10.890 --> 00:02:13.540 
which is a lot but it's not that much I
mean<00:02:11.129> it<00:02:11.250> it's<00:02:12.150> not<00:02:12.300> that<00:02:12.450> much<00:02:12.480> though<00:02:12.870> so

00:02:13.540 --> 00:02:13.550 
mean it it's not that much though so

00:02:13.550 --> 00:02:16.340

00:02:20.360 --> 00:02:20.370 
damage is 37 laughing Thomas is 50 so if

00:02:20.370 --> 00:02:22.070 
damage is 37 laughing Thomas is 50 so if
you're<00:02:20.670> you<00:02:21.270> know<00:02:21.300> you<00:02:21.420> had<00:02:21.630> a<00:02:21.690> head<00:02:21.810> shot

00:02:22.070 --> 00:02:22.080 
you're you know you had a head shot

00:02:22.080 --> 00:02:24.020 
you're you know you had a head shot
that's<00:02:22.290> gonna<00:02:22.440> be<00:02:22.590> like<00:02:22.770> pretty<00:02:23.340> much<00:02:23.460> half

00:02:24.020 --> 00:02:24.030 
that's gonna be like pretty much half

00:02:24.030 --> 00:02:27.890 
that's gonna be like pretty much half
their<00:02:24.420> damage<00:02:24.780> gone<00:02:25.080> and<00:02:25.880> and<00:02:26.880> I<00:02:27.360> imagine<00:02:27.630> if

00:02:27.890 --> 00:02:27.900 
their damage gone and and I imagine if

00:02:27.900 --> 00:02:29.870 
their damage gone and and I imagine if
you<00:02:28.020> get<00:02:28.230> within<00:02:28.860> their<00:02:29.190> head<00:02:29.370> range<00:02:29.670> though

00:02:29.870 --> 00:02:29.880 
you get within their head range though

00:02:29.880 --> 00:02:31.490 
you get within their head range though
it's<00:02:30.120> probably<00:02:30.360> about<00:02:30.600> 75<00:02:31.080> bucks<00:02:31.110> damage

00:02:31.490 --> 00:02:31.500 
it's probably about 75 bucks damage

00:02:31.500 --> 00:02:33.080 
it's probably about 75 bucks damage
anyway<00:02:31.740> so<00:02:31.800> it<00:02:32.010> you<00:02:32.070> could<00:02:32.220> probably<00:02:32.370> get<00:02:32.550> a<00:02:32.580> 1

00:02:33.080 --> 00:02:33.090 
anyway so it you could probably get a 1

00:02:33.090 --> 00:02:35.170 
anyway so it you could probably get a 1
