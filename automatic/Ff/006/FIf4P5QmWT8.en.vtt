something<00:04:58.840> to<00:04:58.900> think<00:04:58.960> about<00:04:59.139> you<00:04:59.530> don't<00:04:59.620> have

00:04:59.700 --> 00:04:59.710 
something to think about you don't have

00:04:59.710 --> 00:05:01.379 
something to think about you don't have
to<00:04:59.889> kill<00:05:00.070> it<00:05:00.099> every<00:05:00.400> single<00:05:00.550> time<00:05:00.700> like<00:05:01.030> we<00:05:01.180> do

00:05:01.379 --> 00:05:01.389 
to kill it every single time like we do

00:05:01.389 --> 00:05:03.600 
to kill it every single time like we do
sometimes<00:05:02.320> you<00:05:03.130> got<00:05:03.250> to<00:05:03.340> be<00:05:03.430> a<00:05:03.460> little

00:05:03.600 --> 00:05:03.610 
sometimes you got to be a little

00:05:03.610 --> 00:05:05.940 
sometimes you got to be a little
beeyotch<00:05:04.330> and<00:05:04.630> go<00:05:04.780> slow<00:05:05.050> so<00:05:05.410> it's<00:05:05.830> all<00:05:05.919> good
