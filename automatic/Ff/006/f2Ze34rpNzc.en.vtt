00:00:08.550 --> 00:00:16.049
 the full countertop today but the star of the 

00:00:12.990 --> 00:00:18.750
 day will be the engine flex the most 

00:00:16.049 --> 00:00:21.779
 new arrived for me there during the week 

00:00:18.750 --> 00:00:24.060
 It's for you to have an idea of 

00:00:21.779 --> 00:00:28.700
 I have here one size crayon bi 

00:00:24.060 --> 00:00:33.000
 or samsung galaxy note 2 samsung galaxy 

00:00:28.700 --> 00:00:35.940
 s 4g or nexus 4 

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:37.860
 the flex engine here i have an iphone 

00:00:35.940 --> 00:00:39.780
 xing ling but he is more or less than 

00:00:37.860 --> 00:00:44.219
 size of an iphone 5 

00:00:39.780 --> 00:00:47.730
 iphone 4 and 1 reiser of one is the question 

00:00:44.219 --> 00:00:50.969
 What else have you heard lately is buying 

00:00:47.730 --> 00:00:54.170
 a nexus 4 on sale 

00:00:50.969 --> 00:00:57.929
 launch of nexus 5 takes an ex engine 

00:00:54.170 --> 00:01:00.089
 good and that's what we're going to talk about 

00:00:57.929 --> 00:01:02.640
 in this video then we will focus on the 

00:01:00.089 --> 00:01:07.040
 and if it's worth paying a 

00:01:02.640 --> 00:01:12.330
 to get him or take 

00:01:07.040 --> 00:01:17.090
 nexus 4g here today for you to have a 

00:01:12.330 --> 00:01:20.480
 Idea of closest size 

00:01:17.090 --> 00:01:26.240
 look at a very reasonable difference neither 

00:01:20.480 --> 00:01:33.380
 I'm going to pick up the west here. 

00:01:26.240 --> 00:01:36.070
 more or less the same thing practically 

00:01:33.380 --> 00:01:36.070
 equal 

00:01:47.480 --> 00:01:55.770
 Good as I said then the focus will be 

00:01:51.210 --> 00:01:59.850
 these two here or nexus 4 and the motorcycle ex a 

00:01:55.770 --> 00:02:02.730
 I do not know if I'll go and get it. 

00:01:59.850 --> 00:02:05.640
 here but the neco it has a good effect 

00:02:02.730 --> 00:02:08.190
 interesting as the angle of 

00:02:05.640 --> 00:02:11.730
 light in it to bring the media 

00:02:08.190 --> 00:02:14.390
 bright spots drew lucas braga 

00:02:11.730 --> 00:02:17.670
 The technical side called the 

00:02:14.390 --> 00:02:21.510
 sequin was a better definition than I 

00:02:17.670 --> 00:02:23.370
 seen so far is worth this glass he has 

00:02:21.510 --> 00:02:25.709
 a little bit of plastic the finish 

00:02:23.370 --> 00:02:27.930
 it's not premium but also the cell phone 

00:02:25.709 --> 00:02:31.920
 is not in that category of super 

00:02:27.930 --> 00:02:34.050
 smartphones as the s4 and a note 2 

00:02:31.920 --> 00:02:36.660
 and we find a lot of promotion 

00:02:34.050 --> 00:02:41.070
 him at retail here in brazil he for 

00:02:36.660 --> 00:02:43.350
 999 in installments or 879 at sight 

00:02:41.070 --> 00:02:47.790
 the engine is ex he appeared he was 

00:02:43.350 --> 00:02:50.850
 announced in fact to 1,799 in the debut 

00:02:47.790 --> 00:02:53.880
 of it has already fallen to 1,499 a 

00:02:50.850 --> 00:02:56.310
 Motorola is there made the 300 the difference 

00:02:53.880 --> 00:02:58.620
 of which there was already part but is common 

00:02:56.310 --> 00:03:01.140
 find also tile and 

00:02:58.620 --> 00:03:03.180
 band of one thousand and two hundred reais 

00:03:01.140 --> 00:03:05.760
 the big question that gets is worth it 

00:03:03.180 --> 00:03:06.600
 pay 400 even more to have a motor 

00:03:05.760 --> 00:03:09.180
 flex 

00:03:06.600 --> 00:03:13.290
 we see that his finishing is a 

00:03:09.180 --> 00:03:17.220
 little more premium of the nexus one bal 

00:03:13.290 --> 00:03:18.269
 he does not even touch the fiber of 

00:03:17.220 --> 00:03:20.970
 carbon 

00:03:18.269 --> 00:03:23.070
 his back because of this 

00:03:20.970 --> 00:03:25.440
 Bend is very good 

00:03:23.070 --> 00:03:28.140
 if it was more rubbery it would be better 

00:03:25.440 --> 00:03:33.000
 still but it looks great in the hand not 

00:03:28.140 --> 00:03:35.519
 seems to be that smartphone like note 

00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:37.260
 you have great difficulty 

00:03:35.519 --> 00:03:39.870
 hold it with one hand and pick up the 

00:03:37.260 --> 00:03:44.940
 corners of the screen here quickly O you 

00:03:39.870 --> 00:03:49.489
 you get this is a big advantage of it 

00:03:44.940 --> 00:03:53.400
 The Great Advantage Of The Ex Motorcycle Truth 

00:03:49.489 --> 00:03:57.000
 owner is that scheme 

00:03:53.400 --> 00:04:01.260
 Talk what honey google? 

00:03:57.000 --> 00:04:04.950
 Ok Google, do not talk, you do not slope. 

00:04:01.260 --> 00:04:08.540
 none button and he's already up I go 

00:04:04.950 --> 00:04:08.540
 talk that helps 

00:04:09.120 --> 00:04:16.620
 Notice that I 'm only holding him. 

00:04:11.700 --> 00:04:20.459
 never put on the advantage of it dies 

00:04:16.620 --> 00:04:22.680
 here by the following is it recognizes the 

00:04:20.459 --> 00:04:25.680
 What do you speak but the commands that he 

00:04:22.680 --> 00:04:27.630
 Do you accept and in Portuguese from Brazil? 

00:04:25.680 --> 00:04:30.870
 very few you can not 

00:04:27.630 --> 00:04:34.380
 example is to do very useful things like 

00:04:30.870 --> 00:04:36.210
 turn off wifi and turn bluetooth on 

00:04:34.380 --> 00:04:39.180
 everything you say to him he goes 

00:04:36.210 --> 00:04:41.970
 google search and answers great 

00:04:39.180 --> 00:04:44.250
 some of them are in text and not in something 

00:04:41.970 --> 00:04:47.430
 so I do not see much use for 

00:04:44.250 --> 00:04:49.830
 This is a pretty good advance. 

00:04:47.430 --> 00:04:53.280
 from the moment you can be 

00:04:49.830 --> 00:04:55.380
 the car sets aside the support and 

00:04:53.280 --> 00:04:58.979
 program to make a call that 

00:04:55.380 --> 00:05:02.099
 pizarro is related to meeting a 

00:04:58.979 --> 00:05:04.770
 call to have him read 

00:05:02.099 --> 00:05:07.979
 a sms that came to you to program a 

00:05:04.770 --> 00:05:10.020
 route on the ips that kind of thing but for 

00:05:07.979 --> 00:05:14.760
 out there so I do not think it's worth it 

00:05:10.020 --> 00:05:17.729
 pay 400 more to have only those 

00:05:14.760 --> 00:05:22.349
 advantages a fast cell phone but it is a 

00:05:17.729 --> 00:05:26.699
 cell phone similar to nexus 4 did not 

00:05:22.349 --> 00:05:28.500
 there is a rather shrill performance of 

00:05:26.699 --> 00:05:31.050
 difference I think is basically the same 

00:05:28.500 --> 00:05:34.590
 thing you can see that the format of the 

00:05:31.050 --> 00:05:38.130
 his screen is more the style of the galaxy 

00:05:34.590 --> 00:05:40.260
 the nexus it has a larger screen a 

00:05:38.130 --> 00:05:42.960
 flex motor screen quality is better 

00:05:40.260 --> 00:05:45.300
 or the nexus is the following when you paste 

00:05:42.960 --> 00:05:47.159
 the front line so the quality is 

00:05:45.300 --> 00:05:49.380
 good as you turn the angle 

00:05:47.159 --> 00:05:52.889
 of his vision falls a lot you realize 

00:05:49.380 --> 00:05:55.560
 that the colors and do not look so cool 

00:05:52.889 --> 00:05:58.139
 it's strange because it has a ips screen 

00:05:55.560 --> 00:06:01.529
 just to improve when I do not 

00:05:58.139 --> 00:06:03.150
 has a front angle because it is a video 

00:06:01.529 --> 00:06:04.639
 first impressions 

00:06:03.150 --> 00:06:07.189
 I'm with ex 

00:06:04.639 --> 00:06:10.370
 the bike is that it has only two days 

00:06:07.189 --> 00:06:13.219
 Guys, you wanted to see then you 're there. 

00:06:10.370 --> 00:06:15.949
 Over the course of the week I'm going to test more 

00:06:13.219 --> 00:06:17.749
 I still like them a card in the sim and I only 

00:06:15.949 --> 00:06:20.300
 I have a microphone that I 'm going to have to 

00:06:17.749 --> 00:06:23.810
 cut the buy one so I'm not 

00:06:20.300 --> 00:06:26.090
 using it is in its entirety as a 

00:06:23.810 --> 00:06:29.270
 I did not go to the street with him. 

00:06:26.090 --> 00:06:33.249
 vi battery life was more to give 

00:06:29.270 --> 00:06:33.249
 these first impressions of himself
