right<00:00:35.280> here<00:00:35.460> that<00:00:35.640> you're<00:00:35.760> witnessing<00:00:36.230> now

00:00:37.220 --> 00:00:37.230 
right here that you're witnessing now

00:00:37.230 --> 00:00:39.170 
right here that you're witnessing now
some<00:00:37.559> could<00:00:37.770> say<00:00:37.890> that<00:00:38.070> this<00:00:38.219> anomaly<00:00:38.790> here<00:00:39.059> is

00:00:39.170 --> 00:00:39.180 
some could say that this anomaly here is

00:00:39.180 --> 00:00:41.360 
some could say that this anomaly here is
a<00:00:39.210> gravity<00:00:39.719> wave<00:00:39.980> which<00:00:40.980> happens<00:00:41.340> sometimes

00:00:41.360 --> 00:00:41.370 
a gravity wave which happens sometimes

00:00:41.370 --> 00:00:43.040 
a gravity wave which happens sometimes
between<00:00:41.940> bodies<00:00:42.420> of<00:00:42.540> water<00:00:42.780> when<00:00:42.960> the

right but that's over a body of water

00:00:46.800 --> 00:00:49.639 
right but that's over a body of water
not<00:00:47.520> coming<00:00:47.969> off<00:00:48.120> the<00:00:48.329> tub<00:00:48.510> off<00:00:48.780> of<00:00:49.110> an<00:00:49.230> island

00:01:06.770 --> 00:01:06.780 
shot here March 26th 2013 one could also

00:01:06.780 --> 00:01:08.899 
shot here March 26th 2013 one could also
also<00:01:06.990> argue<00:01:07.530> that<00:01:07.560> the<00:01:08.340> Russian<00:01:08.670> satellite

00:01:08.899 --> 00:01:08.909 
also argue that the Russian satellite

00:01:08.909 --> 00:01:11.090 
also argue that the Russian satellite
feed<00:01:09.390> had<00:01:09.570> a<00:01:09.600> problem<00:01:09.930> with<00:01:10.229> it<00:01:10.380> or<00:01:10.530> it<00:01:10.979> was

00:01:11.090 --> 00:01:11.100 
feed had a problem with it or it was

00:01:11.100 --> 00:01:14.270 
feed had a problem with it or it was

something in the imagery taking that
into<00:01:14.430> consideration<00:01:14.490> we<00:01:15.390> will<00:01:16.020> eliminate

00:01:16.310 --> 00:01:16.320 
into consideration we will eliminate

00:01:16.320 --> 00:01:18.980 
into consideration we will eliminate
that<00:01:16.830> right<00:01:17.130> here<00:01:17.490> by<00:01:17.820> using<00:01:18.060> the<00:01:18.720> Terra
