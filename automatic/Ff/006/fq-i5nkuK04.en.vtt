out

00:03:38.270 --> 00:03:38.280 
out

00:03:38.280 --> 00:03:40.759 
out
I<00:03:38.549> think<00:03:39.209> sixteen<00:03:39.840> thousand<00:03:40.410> dollars<00:03:40.650> a<00:03:40.739> day

00:03:40.759 --> 00:03:40.769 
I think sixteen thousand dollars a day

00:03:40.769 --> 00:03:43.819 
I think sixteen thousand dollars a day
and<00:03:41.780> you<00:03:42.780> just<00:03:42.810> have<00:03:43.079> to<00:03:43.110> position<00:03:43.470> yourself

00:03:43.819 --> 00:03:43.829 
and you just have to position yourself

00:03:43.829 --> 00:03:49.009 
and you just have to position yourself
in<00:03:44.220> a<00:03:44.340> specific<00:03:44.549> way<00:03:44.910> like<00:03:45.140> um<00:03:47.810> create<00:03:48.810> two

00:03:49.009 --> 00:03:49.019 
in a specific way like um create two

00:03:49.019 --> 00:03:50.509 
in a specific way like um create two
holes<00:03:49.049> behind<00:03:49.709> you<00:03:49.890> or<00:03:50.070> next<00:03:50.190> year<00:03:50.430> or

00:03:50.509 --> 00:03:50.519 
holes behind you or next year or

00:03:50.519 --> 00:03:53.120 
holes behind you or next year or
whatever<00:03:50.670> just<00:03:51.510> hit<00:03:51.690> a<00:03:51.870> rock<00:03:52.320> that<00:03:52.769> you<00:03:52.920> may

00:03:53.120 --> 00:03:53.130 
whatever just hit a rock that you may

00:03:53.130 --> 00:03:55.400 
whatever just hit a rock that you may
think<00:03:53.489> that<00:03:53.579> the<00:03:53.790> money<00:03:53.970> is<00:03:54.090> in<00:03:54.299> and<00:03:55.200> you<00:03:55.230> can

00:03:55.400 --> 00:03:55.410 
think that the money is in and you can

00:03:55.410 --> 00:03:57.020 
think that the money is in and you can
easily<00:03:55.560> get<00:03:55.890> sixteen<00:03:56.340> thousand<00:03:56.730> bells<00:03:56.910> that

00:03:57.020 --> 00:03:57.030 
easily get sixteen thousand bells that

00:03:57.030 --> 00:04:00.770 
easily get sixteen thousand bells that
way<00:03:57.299> add<00:03:57.540> a<00:03:58.220> second<00:03:59.220> way<00:03:59.340> is<00:03:59.610> by<00:04:00.180> finding

00:04:00.770 --> 00:04:00.780 
way add a second way is by finding

00:04:00.780 --> 00:04:04.759 
way add a second way is by finding
fossils<00:04:01.340> fossils<00:04:02.340> I<00:04:02.910> found<00:04:03.299> where<00:04:03.900> it<00:04:04.590> was<00:04:04.739> a

00:04:04.759 --> 00:04:04.769 
fossils fossils I found where it was a

00:04:04.769 --> 00:04:06.860 
fossils fossils I found where it was a
really<00:04:05.220> big<00:04:05.459> success<00:04:05.640> on<00:04:06.120> average<00:04:06.510> I<00:04:06.660> found

00:04:06.860 --> 00:04:06.870 
really big success on average I found

00:04:06.870 --> 00:04:09.170 
really big success on average I found
four<00:04:07.140> fossils<00:04:07.620> a<00:04:07.709> day<00:04:07.920> three<00:04:08.579> to<00:04:08.670> four<00:04:08.850> three

00:04:09.170 --> 00:04:09.180 
four fossils a day three to four three

to four fossils a day in my town and
yeah<00:04:13.260> you<00:04:13.320> can<00:04:13.530> make<00:04:13.650> a<00:04:14.010> lot<00:04:14.610> of<00:04:14.640> money<00:04:14.940> just<00:04:15.060> by

00:04:15.440 --> 00:04:15.450 
yeah you can make a lot of money just by

00:04:15.450 --> 00:04:19.759 
yeah you can make a lot of money just by
doing<00:04:15.690> that<00:04:15.989> and<00:04:17.510> that's<00:04:18.510> really<00:04:18.810> it<00:04:19.109> um<00:04:19.500> there

00:04:19.759 --> 00:04:19.769 
doing that and that's really it um there

00:04:19.769 --> 00:04:22.360 
doing that and that's really it um there
isn't<00:04:20.070> much<00:04:20.250> to<00:04:20.700> it

00:04:22.360 --> 00:04:22.370 
isn't much to it

00:04:22.370 --> 00:04:24.890 
isn't much to it
another<00:04:23.370> way<00:04:23.639> is<00:04:23.820> if<00:04:23.850> you<00:04:24.150> let<00:04:24.330> go<00:04:24.660> to<00:04:24.720> the

00:07:07.439 --> 00:07:07.449 
definitely catch that I mean that's the

00:07:07.449 --> 00:07:10.589 
definitely catch that I mean that's the
kind<00:07:08.199> of<00:07:08.320> speaks<00:07:08.530> for<00:07:08.590> itself<00:07:08.860> but<00:07:09.099> um<00:07:09.970> sharks

00:07:10.589 --> 00:07:10.599 
kind of speaks for itself but um sharks

00:07:10.599 --> 00:07:12.300 
kind of speaks for itself but um sharks
like<00:07:10.810> whale<00:07:10.990> sharks<00:07:11.410> and<00:07:11.590> sharks<00:07:11.949> are<00:07:12.039> kind<00:07:12.250> of

00:07:12.300 --> 00:07:12.310 
like whale sharks and sharks are kind of

00:07:12.310 --> 00:07:14.909 
like whale sharks and sharks are kind of
hard<00:07:12.759> to<00:07:12.820> find<00:07:13.229> the<00:07:14.229> most<00:07:14.349> common<00:07:14.740> would<00:07:14.860> be

00:07:14.909 --> 00:07:14.919 
hard to find the most common would be

00:07:14.919 --> 00:07:19.290 
hard to find the most common would be
your<00:07:16.110> the<00:07:17.110> soft<00:07:17.380> shark<00:07:17.680> but<00:07:18.580> even<00:07:18.880> then<00:07:19.090> it's
