installed<00:01:39.580> into<00:01:39.820> a<00:01:39.939> radius<00:01:40.420> if<00:01:40.630> it<00:01:40.900> kinks<00:01:41.409> you

00:01:41.580 --> 00:01:41.590 
installed into a radius if it kinks you

00:01:41.590 --> 00:01:43.920 
installed into a radius if it kinks you
will<00:01:41.740> automatically<00:01:42.310> have<00:01:42.460> a<00:01:42.610> leak<00:01:42.939> the<00:01:43.509> kinks

00:01:43.920 --> 00:01:43.930 
will automatically have a leak the kinks

00:01:43.930 --> 00:01:45.719 
will automatically have a leak the kinks
create<00:01:44.229> valley<00:01:44.530> is<00:01:44.740> causing<00:01:45.130> the<00:01:45.250> leak<00:01:45.430> either

00:01:45.719 --> 00:01:45.729 
create valley is causing the leak either

00:01:45.729 --> 00:01:49.270 
create valley is causing the leak either
immediately<00:01:46.119> or<00:01:46.509> over<00:01:46.990> time

00:01:49.270 --> 00:01:49.280 

00:01:49.280 --> 00:01:51.580 

the<00:01:49.970> trick<00:01:50.240> is<00:01:50.450> to<00:01:50.479> pick<00:01:50.869> the<00:01:50.990> proper<00:01:51.350> Bend

00:01:51.580 --> 00:01:51.590 
the trick is to pick the proper Bend

00:01:51.590 --> 00:01:59.940 
the trick is to pick the proper Bend
radius<00:01:51.830> in<00:01:52.369> comparison<00:01:53.270> to<00:01:53.360> your<00:01:53.479> application

00:01:59.940 --> 00:01:59.950
