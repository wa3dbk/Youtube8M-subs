I get the diamond like everybody's
looking<00:00:08.700> for<00:00:09.000> this<00:00:09.150> magic<00:00:10.139> bullet<00:00:10.380> there<00:00:10.650> must

00:00:10.820 --> 00:00:10.830 
looking for this magic bullet there must

00:00:10.830 --> 00:00:12.560 
looking for this magic bullet there must
be<00:00:10.950> like<00:00:11.160> if<00:00:11.250> I<00:00:11.340> do<00:00:11.400> it<00:00:11.639> this<00:00:11.849> way<00:00:12.120> maybe<00:00:12.330> if<00:00:12.480> I

00:00:16.920 --> 00:00:19.340 
content across and this way or how long
is<00:00:17.070> my<00:00:17.190> meaning<00:00:17.670> gonna<00:00:17.880> be<00:00:18.090> and<00:00:18.510> and<00:00:19.050> all<00:00:19.170> that

00:00:19.340 --> 00:00:19.350 
is my meaning gonna be and and all that

00:00:19.350 --> 00:00:22.939 
is my meaning gonna be and and all that
you<00:00:19.500> know<00:00:20.779> do<00:00:21.779> those<00:00:21.930> things<00:00:22.230> matter<00:00:22.529> you<00:00:22.859> know

00:00:22.939 --> 00:00:22.949 
you know do those things matter you know

00:00:22.949 --> 00:00:24.980 
you know do those things matter you know
yeah<00:00:23.460> I<00:00:23.490> guess<00:00:23.850> so<00:00:24.060> I<00:00:24.090> guess<00:00:24.269> it's<00:00:24.600> times<00:00:24.810> they

00:00:24.980 --> 00:00:24.990 
yeah I guess so I guess it's times they

00:00:24.990 --> 00:00:27.019 
yeah I guess so I guess it's times they
matter<00:00:25.199> but<00:00:25.410> there's<00:00:25.560> something<00:00:25.890> even<00:00:26.160> more

00:00:27.019 --> 00:00:27.029 
matter but there's something even more

00:00:27.029 --> 00:00:30.019 
matter but there's something even more
crucial<00:00:27.630> to<00:00:28.439> being<00:00:28.710> a<00:00:29.070> diamond<00:00:29.609> or<00:00:29.730> to<00:00:29.820> being

00:00:30.019 --> 00:00:30.029 
crucial to being a diamond or to being

00:00:30.029 --> 00:00:31.999 
crucial to being a diamond or to being
