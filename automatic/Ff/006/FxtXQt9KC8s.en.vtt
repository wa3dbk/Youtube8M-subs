00:00:37.760 --> 00:00:37.770 
architectures if we start looking at the

00:00:37.770 --> 00:00:39.680 
architectures if we start looking at the
motherboard<00:00:38.309> of<00:00:38.399> our<00:00:38.550> computer<00:00:39.059> we<00:00:39.300> can<00:00:39.420> see

00:00:39.680 --> 00:00:39.690 
motherboard of our computer we can see

00:00:39.690 --> 00:00:41.060 
motherboard of our computer we can see
these<00:00:39.840> slots<00:00:40.230> that<00:00:40.469> have<00:00:40.649> been<00:00:40.770> put<00:00:40.950> on<00:00:40.980> the

00:00:41.060 --> 00:00:41.070 
these slots that have been put on the

00:00:41.070 --> 00:00:43.100 
these slots that have been put on the
computer<00:00:41.340> and<00:00:41.820> the<00:00:42.059> reason<00:00:42.480> they're<00:00:42.629> there<00:00:42.899> is

00:00:43.100 --> 00:00:43.110 
computer and the reason they're there is

00:00:43.110 --> 00:00:45.170 
computer and the reason they're there is
because<00:00:43.440> our<00:00:44.129> computers<00:00:44.670> from<00:00:44.850> the<00:00:44.969> very

00:00:45.170 --> 00:00:45.180 
because our computers from the very

00:00:45.180 --> 00:00:48.200 
because our computers from the very
beginning<00:00:45.719> we<00:00:46.140> needed<00:00:46.500> a<00:00:46.559> way<00:00:46.590> to<00:00:46.829> modify<00:00:47.670> and

00:00:48.200 --> 00:00:48.210 
beginning we needed a way to modify and

00:00:48.210 --> 00:00:50.930 
beginning we needed a way to modify and
add<00:00:48.570> and<00:00:48.989> be<00:00:49.350> able<00:00:49.649> to<00:00:49.890> customize<00:00:50.610> the

00:00:50.930 --> 00:00:50.940 
add and be able to customize the

00:00:50.940 --> 00:00:53.209 
add and be able to customize the
functionality<00:00:51.149> of<00:00:51.719> our<00:00:51.840> computers<00:00:52.350> and<00:00:52.559> so<00:00:53.039> we

00:00:53.209 --> 00:00:53.219 
functionality of our computers and so we

00:00:53.219 --> 00:00:54.619 
functionality of our computers and so we
not<00:00:53.370> only<00:00:53.399> have<00:00:53.640> what<00:00:54.120> comes<00:00:54.390> on<00:00:54.539> the

00:00:54.619 --> 00:00:54.629 
not only have what comes on the

00:00:54.629 --> 00:00:56.479 
not only have what comes on the
motherboard<00:00:54.899> but<00:00:55.559> we've<00:00:55.739> got<00:00:55.920> these<00:00:56.129> really

00:00:56.479 --> 00:00:56.489 
motherboard but we've got these really

00:00:56.489 --> 00:00:59.630 
motherboard but we've got these really
great<00:00:57.120> slots<00:00:57.570> there<00:00:57.840> we<00:00:58.079> can<00:00:58.260> plug<00:00:58.590> in<00:00:58.620> our<00:00:59.160> own

00:00:59.630 --> 00:00:59.640 
great slots there we can plug in our own

00:00:59.640 --> 00:01:01.819 
great slots there we can plug in our own
video<00:01:00.000> cards<00:01:00.449> we<00:01:00.600> can<00:01:00.750> plug<00:01:01.020> in<00:01:01.199> additional

00:01:01.819 --> 00:01:01.829 
video cards we can plug in additional

00:01:01.829 --> 00:01:03.349 
video cards we can plug in additional
communications<00:01:02.489> cards<00:01:02.879> or<00:01:03.000> additional

00:01:03.349 --> 00:01:03.359 
communications cards or additional

00:01:03.359 --> 00:01:05.810 
communications cards or additional
multimedia<00:01:04.019> cards<00:01:04.409> and<00:01:04.559> really<00:01:05.280> we<00:01:05.460> can<00:01:05.610> make

00:01:05.810 --> 00:01:05.820 
multimedia cards and really we can make

00:01:05.820 --> 00:01:07.670 
multimedia cards and really we can make
our<00:01:06.000> computer<00:01:06.450> work<00:01:06.600> exactly<00:01:07.020> the<00:01:07.320> way<00:01:07.470> we'd

00:01:07.670 --> 00:01:07.680 
our computer work exactly the way we'd

00:01:07.680 --> 00:01:10.789 
our computer work exactly the way we'd
like<00:01:07.710> if<00:01:08.159> you<00:01:08.700> see<00:01:08.880> any<00:01:09.030> adapter<00:01:09.659> card<00:01:10.049> slots

00:01:10.789 --> 00:01:10.799 
like if you see any adapter card slots

00:01:10.799 --> 00:01:13.310 
like if you see any adapter card slots
like<00:01:11.040> this<00:01:11.310> these<00:01:11.580> are<00:01:11.640> PCI<00:01:12.150> cards<00:01:12.659> and<00:01:12.869> you

00:01:13.310 --> 00:01:13.320 
like this these are PCI cards and you

00:01:13.320 --> 00:01:16.070 
like this these are PCI cards and you
can<00:01:13.470> see<00:01:13.650> not<00:01:13.799> just<00:01:14.010> the<00:01:14.280> 32-bit<00:01:14.760> PCI<00:01:15.299> but<00:01:15.960> the

00:01:16.070 --> 00:01:16.080 
can see not just the 32-bit PCI but the

00:01:16.080 --> 00:01:18.859 
can see not just the 32-bit PCI but the
64-bit<00:01:16.890> PCI<00:01:17.400> slots<00:01:18.060> and<00:01:18.330> you'll<00:01:18.420> notice<00:01:18.689> that

00:01:18.859 --> 00:01:18.869 
64-bit PCI slots and you'll notice that

00:01:18.869 --> 00:01:21.230 
64-bit PCI slots and you'll notice that
the<00:01:19.680> different<00:01:20.070> slots<00:01:20.400> have<00:01:20.729> different

00:01:21.230 --> 00:01:21.240 
the different slots have different

00:01:21.240 --> 00:01:23.480 
the different slots have different
connectors<00:01:22.049> in<00:01:22.259> them<00:01:22.590> these<00:01:23.040> different

00:01:23.480 --> 00:01:23.490 
connectors in them these different

00:01:23.490 --> 00:01:25.550 
connectors in them these different
bridges<00:01:23.759> going<00:01:24.090> across<00:01:24.509> where<00:01:24.840> you<00:01:25.140> can<00:01:25.290> only

00:01:25.550 --> 00:01:25.560 
bridges going across where you can only

00:01:25.560 --> 00:01:27.890 
bridges going across where you can only
fit<00:01:26.130> the<00:01:26.159> right<00:01:26.610> type<00:01:26.970> of<00:01:27.000> card<00:01:27.450> in<00:01:27.659> there

00:01:27.890 --> 00:01:27.900 
fit the right type of card in there

00:01:27.900 --> 00:01:29.690 
fit the right type of card in there
that's<00:01:28.409> something<00:01:28.829> that<00:01:28.979> universally

00:01:29.690 --> 00:01:29.700 
that's something that universally

00:01:29.700 --> 00:01:31.850 
that's something that universally
universally<00:01:30.240> you'll<00:01:30.750> see<00:01:30.930> across<00:01:31.170> adapter

00:01:31.850 --> 00:01:31.860 
universally you'll see across adapter

00:01:31.860 --> 00:01:34.490 
universally you'll see across adapter

00:05:20.730 --> 00:05:20.740 
which is probably why it's one of the

00:05:20.740 --> 00:05:22.800 
which is probably why it's one of the
reasons<00:05:21.099> why<00:05:21.340> we<00:05:21.849> really<00:05:21.880> don't<00:05:22.180> see<00:05:22.300> a<00:05:22.419> GP

00:05:22.800 --> 00:05:22.810 
reasons why we really don't see a GP

00:05:22.810 --> 00:05:25.260 
reasons why we really don't see a GP
much<00:05:23.139> anymore<00:05:23.409> if<00:05:23.770> we<00:05:23.979> can<00:05:24.220> put<00:05:24.460> everything<00:05:24.880> in

00:05:25.260 --> 00:05:25.270 
much anymore if we can put everything in

00:05:25.270 --> 00:05:27.540 
much anymore if we can put everything in
a<00:05:25.630> PCI<00:05:26.050> Express<00:05:26.139> and<00:05:26.740> run<00:05:26.889> everything<00:05:27.340> from

00:05:27.540 --> 00:05:27.550 
a PCI Express and run everything from

00:05:27.550 --> 00:05:29.550 
a PCI Express and run everything from
PCI<00:05:28.060> Express<00:05:28.389> just<00:05:28.900> makes<00:05:29.080> sense<00:05:29.229> to<00:05:29.440> do<00:05:29.530> it

00:05:29.550 --> 00:05:29.560 
PCI Express just makes sense to do it

00:05:29.560 --> 00:05:33.600 
PCI Express just makes sense to do it
that<00:05:29.710> way<00:05:30.930> here's<00:05:31.930> a<00:05:32.020> close-up<00:05:32.440> of<00:05:32.710> the<00:05:32.919> AGP

00:05:33.600 --> 00:05:33.610 
that way here's a close-up of the AGP

00:05:33.610 --> 00:05:35.339 
that way here's a close-up of the AGP
one<00:05:33.849> thing<00:05:34.060> that's<00:05:34.240> nice<00:05:34.419> about<00:05:34.479> this<00:05:35.020> is<00:05:35.199> not

00:05:35.339 --> 00:05:35.349 
one thing that's nice about this is not

00:05:35.349 --> 00:05:37.680 
one thing that's nice about this is not
only<00:05:35.409> do<00:05:35.800> you<00:05:35.919> have<00:05:35.949> these<00:05:36.759> very<00:05:37.090> very<00:05:37.330> tiny

00:05:37.680 --> 00:05:37.690 
only do you have these very very tiny

00:05:37.690 --> 00:05:39.149 
only do you have these very very tiny
little<00:05:37.990> connections<00:05:38.650> and<00:05:38.770> those<00:05:38.860> there's<00:05:39.099> a

00:05:39.149 --> 00:05:39.159 
little connections and those there's a

00:05:39.159 --> 00:05:41.610 
little connections and those there's a
lot<00:05:39.520> of<00:05:39.669> connections<00:05:40.210> on<00:05:40.389> here<00:05:40.659> not<00:05:40.840> just<00:05:41.139> the

00:05:41.610 --> 00:05:41.620 
lot of connections on here not just the

00:05:41.620 --> 00:05:43.350 
lot of connections on here not just the
larger<00:05:42.070> connections<00:05:42.580> were<00:05:42.729> used<00:05:42.940> to<00:05:43.060> seeing

00:05:43.350 --> 00:05:43.360 
larger connections were used to seeing

00:05:43.360 --> 00:05:45.360 
larger connections were used to seeing
but<00:05:43.479> they're<00:05:43.840> all<00:05:43.990> interlaced<00:05:44.560> here<00:05:44.979> with

00:05:45.360 --> 00:05:45.370 
but they're all interlaced here with

00:05:45.370 --> 00:05:47.010 
but they're all interlaced here with
some<00:05:45.550> smaller<00:05:45.880> ones<00:05:46.120> it<00:05:46.270> has<00:05:46.300> to<00:05:46.509> really<00:05:46.719> fit

00:05:47.010 --> 00:05:47.020 
some smaller ones it has to really fit

00:05:47.020 --> 00:05:49.020 
some smaller ones it has to really fit
in<00:05:47.110> there<00:05:47.320> just<00:05:47.590> so<00:05:47.740> because<00:05:48.430> of<00:05:48.669> that<00:05:48.789> a

00:05:49.020 --> 00:05:49.030 
in there just so because of that a

00:05:49.030 --> 00:05:51.420 
in there just so because of that a
number<00:05:49.570> of<00:05:49.690> the<00:05:49.960> high-end<00:05:50.380> graphic<00:05:50.800> cards<00:05:51.250> and

00:05:51.420 --> 00:05:51.430 
number of the high-end graphic cards and

00:05:51.430 --> 00:05:53.610 
number of the high-end graphic cards and
other<00:05:51.820> adapter<00:05:52.360> cards<00:05:52.659> as<00:05:52.810> well<00:05:52.990> have<00:05:53.440> these

00:05:53.610 --> 00:05:53.620 
other adapter cards as well have these

00:05:53.620 --> 00:05:54.990 
other adapter cards as well have these
little<00:05:53.860> hooks<00:05:54.039> on<00:05:54.310> them<00:05:54.580> and<00:05:54.820> the

00:05:54.990 --> 00:05:55.000 
little hooks on them and the

00:05:55.000 --> 00:05:56.310 
little hooks on them and the
motherboards<00:05:55.509> will<00:05:55.659> also<00:05:55.930> have<00:05:56.050> a<00:05:56.110> place

00:05:56.310 --> 00:05:56.320 
motherboards will also have a place

00:05:56.320 --> 00:05:58.379 
motherboards will also have a place
where<00:05:56.530> you<00:05:56.620> can<00:05:56.740> put<00:05:56.949> the<00:05:57.009> hook<00:05:57.310> on<00:05:57.520> there<00:05:57.820> so

00:05:58.379 --> 00:05:58.389 
where you can put the hook on there so

00:05:58.389 --> 00:06:00.029 
where you can put the hook on there so
that<00:05:58.539> the<00:05:58.690> card<00:05:58.990> will<00:05:59.169> always<00:05:59.620> stay<00:05:59.860> in<00:05:59.889> the

00:06:00.029 --> 00:06:00.039 
that the card will always stay in the

00:06:00.039 --> 00:06:01.709 
that the card will always stay in the
slot<00:06:00.340> one<00:06:00.699> of<00:06:00.759> the<00:06:00.849> problems<00:06:01.360> that<00:06:01.539> we've<00:06:01.690> had

00:06:01.709 --> 00:06:01.719 
slot one of the problems that we've had

00:06:01.719 --> 00:06:03.450 
slot one of the problems that we've had
through<00:06:02.500> the<00:06:02.530> years<00:06:02.919> is<00:06:03.130> that<00:06:03.280> these

00:06:03.450 --> 00:06:03.460 
through the years is that these

00:06:03.460 --> 00:06:05.370 
through the years is that these
expansion<00:06:04.030> cards<00:06:04.330> tend<00:06:04.539> to<00:06:04.599> pop<00:06:04.870> out<00:06:05.050> of<00:06:05.080> the

00:06:05.370 --> 00:06:05.380 
expansion cards tend to pop out of the

00:06:05.380 --> 00:06:07.439 
expansion cards tend to pop out of the
slots<00:06:05.680> especially<00:06:06.310> if<00:06:06.400> you<00:06:06.490> ship<00:06:06.759> them<00:06:07.000> or

00:06:07.439 --> 00:06:07.449 
slots especially if you ship them or

00:06:07.449 --> 00:06:09.060 
slots especially if you ship them or
you're<00:06:07.659> moving<00:06:07.870> them<00:06:08.199> around<00:06:08.349> the<00:06:08.710> lot<00:06:08.889> or

00:06:09.060 --> 00:06:09.070 
you're moving them around the lot or

00:06:09.070 --> 00:06:11.010 
you're moving them around the lot or
just<00:06:09.099> the<00:06:09.460> differences<00:06:09.969> in<00:06:10.150> the<00:06:10.300> the<00:06:10.780> heat

00:06:11.010 --> 00:06:11.020 
just the differences in the the heat

00:06:11.020 --> 00:06:13.110 
just the differences in the the heat
that<00:06:11.259> heats<00:06:11.979> them<00:06:12.159> up<00:06:12.310> and<00:06:12.580> then<00:06:12.699> they<00:06:12.729> cool

00:06:13.110 --> 00:06:13.120 
that heats them up and then they cool

00:06:13.120 --> 00:06:15.300 
that heats them up and then they cool
down<00:06:13.330> and<00:06:13.509> contract<00:06:13.960> can<00:06:14.530> occasionally<00:06:14.889> have
