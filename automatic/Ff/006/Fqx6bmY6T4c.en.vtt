these types of bikes are very durable
frames<00:00:30.210> they<00:00:30.810> take<00:00:31.080> their<00:00:31.320> geometry<00:00:31.679> from<00:00:32.309> the

example we'll have a nice suspension
fork<00:00:44.370> on<00:00:44.579> there<00:00:44.910> you've<00:00:45.899> got<00:00:45.930> the<00:00:46.289> lock<00:00:46.530> out<00:00:46.800> on

00:00:47.119 --> 00:00:47.129 
fork on there you've got the lock out on

00:00:47.129 --> 00:00:48.830 
fork on there you've got the lock out on
the<00:00:47.610> fork<00:00:47.910> so<00:00:48.180> when<00:00:48.329> you're<00:00:48.450> riding<00:00:48.600> on

00:00:48.830 --> 00:00:48.840

pavement as opposed to on a dirt road or
something<00:00:52.140> you<00:00:52.320> can<00:00:52.469> lock<00:00:52.680> it<00:00:52.860> out<00:00:52.949> there<00:00:53.219> and

00:00:53.330 --> 00:00:53.340 
something you can lock it out there and

00:00:53.340 --> 00:00:56.889 
something you can lock it out there and
you<00:00:53.520> got<00:00:53.670> a<00:00:53.699> nice<00:00:53.879> efficiency<00:00:55.039> flip<00:00:56.039> that<00:00:56.219> back

00:00:56.889 --> 00:00:56.899 
you got a nice efficiency flip that back

00:00:56.899 --> 00:00:59.630 
you got a nice efficiency flip that back
on<00:00:57.899> the<00:00:58.109> other<00:00:58.260> side<00:00:58.620> here<00:00:58.920> something<00:00:59.489> also

00:00:59.630 --> 00:00:59.640 
on the other side here something also

00:00:59.640 --> 00:01:01.430 
on the other side here something also
taken<00:01:00.120> from<00:01:00.149> the<00:01:00.420> mountain<00:01:00.719> bikes<00:01:00.930> you've<00:01:01.199> got

00:01:01.430 --> 00:01:01.440 
taken from the mountain bikes you've got

00:01:01.440 --> 00:01:04.250 
taken from the mountain bikes you've got
disc<00:01:01.980> brakes<00:01:02.359> the<00:01:03.359> disc<00:01:03.570> brakes<00:01:03.870> are<00:01:04.110> gonna

00:01:04.250 --> 00:01:04.260 
disc brakes the disc brakes are gonna

00:01:04.260 --> 00:01:06.260 
disc brakes the disc brakes are gonna
provide<00:01:04.500> a<00:01:04.680> lot<00:01:04.949> of<00:01:04.979> stopping<00:01:05.610> power<00:01:05.820> in

00:01:06.260 --> 00:01:06.270 
provide a lot of stopping power in

00:01:06.270 --> 00:01:08.390 
provide a lot of stopping power in
situations<00:01:06.990> where<00:01:07.260> it<00:01:07.350> might<00:01:07.500> be<00:01:07.560> wet<00:01:07.950> or

00:01:08.390 --> 00:01:08.400 
situations where it might be wet or

00:01:08.400 --> 00:01:11.179 
situations where it might be wet or
muddy<00:01:08.790> where<00:01:09.299> rim<00:01:09.570> brakes<00:01:09.900> would<00:01:10.290> would<00:01:10.830> slip

00:01:11.179 --> 00:01:11.189 
muddy where rim brakes would would slip

00:01:11.189 --> 00:01:12.649 
muddy where rim brakes would would slip
and<00:01:11.369> they<00:01:11.430> wouldn't<00:01:11.700> grab<00:01:11.909> as<00:01:12.119> well<00:01:12.270> the<00:01:12.450> disc

00:01:12.649 --> 00:01:12.659 
and they wouldn't grab as well the disc

00:01:12.659 --> 00:01:14.660 
and they wouldn't grab as well the disc
brakes<00:01:12.930> are<00:01:13.049> gonna<00:01:13.200> thrive<00:01:13.500> a<00:01:13.860> lot<00:01:14.430> better

00:01:14.660 --> 00:01:14.670 
brakes are gonna thrive a lot better

00:01:14.670 --> 00:01:16.130 
brakes are gonna thrive a lot better
stopping<00:01:15.270> power<00:01:15.450> or<00:01:15.780> if<00:01:15.900> you're<00:01:16.020> going

00:01:16.130 --> 00:01:16.140 
stopping power or if you're going

00:01:16.140 --> 00:01:18.170 
stopping power or if you're going
downhill<00:01:16.500> also<00:01:17.220> so<00:01:17.460> this<00:01:17.670> brakes<00:01:17.970> are<00:01:18.150> a

00:01:18.170 --> 00:01:18.180 
downhill also so this brakes are a

00:01:18.180 --> 00:01:20.600 
downhill also so this brakes are a
really<00:01:18.540> nice<00:01:18.750> thing<00:01:19.439> to<00:01:19.590> have<00:01:19.770> on<00:01:20.040> a<00:01:20.070> bike<00:01:20.340> or

00:01:25.140 --> 00:01:27.800 
or muddy conditions this particular
model<00:01:25.500> up<00:01:25.860> from<00:01:26.220> the<00:01:26.400> 8.1<00:01:27.270> that<00:01:27.479> we<00:01:27.570> talked

00:01:27.800 --> 00:01:27.810 
model up from the 8.1 that we talked

00:01:27.810 --> 00:01:30.350 
model up from the 8.1 that we talked
about<00:01:27.960> is<00:01:28.229> gonna<00:01:28.439> have<00:01:28.650> those<00:01:28.890> upgrades<00:01:29.490> as

00:01:30.350 --> 00:01:30.360 
about is gonna have those upgrades as

00:01:30.360 --> 00:01:32.960 
about is gonna have those upgrades as
well<00:01:30.570> as<00:01:30.689> a<00:01:30.750> higher-end<00:01:31.070> drivetrain<00:01:32.070> here<00:01:32.369> the

00:01:32.960 --> 00:01:32.970 
well as a higher-end drivetrain here the

00:01:32.970 --> 00:01:36.560 
well as a higher-end drivetrain here the
dual<00:01:33.299> sports<00:01:33.780> will<00:01:34.079> have<00:01:34.909> larger<00:01:35.909> chain<00:01:36.240> rings

00:01:36.560 --> 00:01:36.570 
dual sports will have larger chain rings

00:01:36.570 --> 00:01:38.060 
dual sports will have larger chain rings
than<00:01:36.869> what<00:01:37.020> you<00:01:37.170> would<00:01:37.290> find<00:01:37.530> on<00:01:37.860> a<00:01:37.920> typical

00:01:38.060 --> 00:01:38.070 
than what you would find on a typical

00:01:38.070 --> 00:01:40.580 
than what you would find on a typical
mountain<00:01:38.939> bike<00:01:39.210> so<00:01:39.810> what<00:01:40.020> that<00:01:40.170> does<00:01:40.439> is

00:01:40.580 --> 00:01:40.590 
mountain bike so what that does is

00:01:40.590 --> 00:01:42.140 
mountain bike so what that does is
provide<00:01:40.920> you<00:01:41.130> with<00:01:41.369> a<00:01:41.610> little<00:01:41.939> bit<00:01:42.060> higher

00:01:42.140 --> 00:01:42.150 
provide you with a little bit higher

00:01:42.150 --> 00:01:44.090 
provide you with a little bit higher
gearing<00:01:42.930> for<00:01:42.990> when<00:01:43.470> you're<00:01:43.590> doing<00:01:43.890> long

00:01:44.090 --> 00:01:44.100 
gearing for when you're doing long

00:01:44.100 --> 00:01:46.010 
gearing for when you're doing long
distance<00:01:44.310> pavement<00:01:45.149> riding<00:01:45.540> you're<00:01:45.869> not

00:01:46.010 --> 00:01:46.020 
distance pavement riding you're not

00:01:46.020 --> 00:01:47.660 
distance pavement riding you're not
going<00:01:46.170> to<00:01:46.229> spin<00:01:46.590> out<00:01:46.770> of<00:01:46.920> those<00:01:47.009> gears<00:01:47.399> as

00:01:47.660 --> 00:01:47.670 
going to spin out of those gears as

00:01:47.670 --> 00:01:49.700 
going to spin out of those gears as
easily<00:01:47.880> so<00:01:48.720> that's<00:01:48.899> a<00:01:49.079> nice<00:01:49.229> feature<00:01:49.259> that

00:01:49.700 --> 00:01:49.710 
easily so that's a nice feature that

00:01:49.710 --> 00:01:50.899 
easily so that's a nice feature that
they<00:01:49.979> have<00:01:50.189> on<00:01:50.369> here<00:01:50.579> that<00:01:50.610> you<00:01:50.820> don't

they have on here that you don't
necessarily<00:01:51.090> get<00:01:51.689> with<00:01:51.899> a<00:01:51.930> 29<00:01:52.680> or<00:01:52.920> mountain

00:01:53.389 --> 00:01:53.399 
necessarily get with a 29 or mountain

00:01:53.399 --> 00:01:57.219 
necessarily get with a 29 or mountain
bike<00:01:54.290> you<00:01:55.290> are<00:01:55.710> you<00:01:55.860> do<00:01:56.009> have<00:01:56.159> the<00:01:56.280> 700c<00:01:57.119> wheels

bike you are you do have the 700c wheels

00:01:57.229 --> 00:02:00.440 
bike you are you do have the 700c wheels
with<00:01:58.229> the<00:01:58.259> narrower<00:01:58.680> tires<00:01:59.040> these<00:01:59.850> tires<00:02:00.149> are

00:02:00.440 --> 00:02:00.450 
with the narrower tires these tires are

00:02:00.450 --> 00:02:03.380 
with the narrower tires these tires are
going<00:02:01.170> to<00:02:01.409> be<00:02:01.619> very<00:02:02.340> efficient<00:02:02.820> on<00:02:02.909> pavement

00:02:03.380 --> 00:02:03.390 
going to be very efficient on pavement

00:02:03.390 --> 00:02:04.730 
going to be very efficient on pavement
they're<00:02:03.509> also<00:02:03.719> going<00:02:03.840> to<00:02:03.899> provide<00:02:04.110> some<00:02:04.409> grip

00:02:04.730 --> 00:02:04.740 
they're also going to provide some grip
