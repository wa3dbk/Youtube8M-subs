00:01:52.580 --> 00:01:52.590 
it's not directly translated into

00:01:52.590 --> 00:01:57.280 
it's not directly translated into
clothes<00:01:53.040> and<00:01:53.340> actually<00:01:54.060> I<00:01:54.300> first<00:01:55.110> make<00:01:55.759> books

00:01:59.900 --> 00:01:59.910 
filled with graphical work filled with

00:01:59.910 --> 00:02:04.880 
filled with graphical work filled with
inspiration<00:02:01.280> for<00:02:02.280> this<00:02:02.460> collection<00:02:03.619> the<00:02:04.619> main

00:02:04.880 --> 00:02:04.890 
inspiration for this collection the main

00:02:04.890 --> 00:02:07.340 
inspiration for this collection the main
idea<00:02:05.310> was<00:02:05.460> to<00:02:05.670> work<00:02:05.700> with<00:02:05.910> manipulation<00:02:06.780> and

00:02:07.340 --> 00:02:07.350 
idea was to work with manipulation and

00:02:07.350 --> 00:02:10.010 
idea was to work with manipulation and
then<00:02:07.560> I<00:02:07.710> came<00:02:08.640> up<00:02:08.700> through<00:02:09.119> a<00:02:09.209> research<00:02:09.750> about

00:02:10.010 --> 00:02:10.020 
then I came up through a research about

00:02:10.020 --> 00:02:14.060 
then I came up through a research about
coats<00:02:11.120> creaky<00:02:12.120> coats<00:02:12.420> in<00:02:12.810> the<00:02:13.020> USA<00:02:13.770> in<00:02:13.950> the

00:02:14.060 --> 00:02:14.070 
coats creaky coats in the USA in the

00:02:14.070 --> 00:02:16.760 
coats creaky coats in the USA in the
seventies<00:02:14.670> that<00:02:15.450> made<00:02:15.660> me<00:02:15.870> come<00:02:16.080> to<00:02:16.110> the<00:02:16.380> idea

00:02:16.760 --> 00:02:16.770 
seventies that made me come to the idea

00:02:16.770 --> 00:02:19.490 
seventies that made me come to the idea
to<00:02:16.980> create<00:02:17.430> my<00:02:17.700> own<00:02:17.730> coat<00:02:18.239> with<00:02:18.540> my<00:02:18.720> own<00:02:18.870> dog<00:02:19.200> as

00:02:19.490 --> 00:02:19.500 
to create my own coat with my own dog as

00:02:19.500 --> 00:02:25.140 
to create my own coat with my own dog as
the<00:02:19.709> applicant<00:02:20.520> leader

00:02:25.140 --> 00:02:25.150 

00:02:25.150 --> 00:02:28.320 

I<00:02:25.180> like<00:02:25.930> the<00:02:26.140> idea<00:02:26.590> that<00:02:26.730> crazy<00:02:27.730> people<00:02:28.090> in

00:02:28.320 --> 00:02:28.330 
I like the idea that crazy people in

00:02:28.330 --> 00:02:30.809 
I like the idea that crazy people in
Japan<00:02:28.750> go<00:02:28.989> where<00:02:29.260> my<00:02:29.470> stuff<00:02:29.830> but<00:02:30.129> that's<00:02:30.370> the

00:02:30.809 --> 00:02:30.819 
Japan go where my stuff but that's the

00:02:30.819 --> 00:02:33.240 
Japan go where my stuff but that's the
main<00:02:31.060> thing<00:02:31.299> of<00:02:31.480> it<00:02:31.629> is<00:02:31.870> just<00:02:32.290> produced<00:02:32.799> here

00:02:33.240 --> 00:02:33.250 
main thing of it is just produced here

00:02:33.250 --> 00:02:36.809 
main thing of it is just produced here
in<00:02:33.280> my<00:02:33.670> small<00:02:34.209> flemish<00:02:35.049> house<00:02:35.890> in<00:02:36.400> Rome<00:02:36.610> with

00:02:36.809 --> 00:02:36.819 
in my small flemish house in Rome with

00:02:36.819 --> 00:02:49.950 
in my small flemish house in Rome with
them<00:02:37.000> so<00:02:37.299> I<00:02:37.599> like<00:02:38.549> the<00:02:39.549> contrast<00:02:40.090> between<00:02:40.299> them

00:02:49.950 --> 00:02:49.960
