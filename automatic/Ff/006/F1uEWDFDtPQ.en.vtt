00:00:53.700 --> 00:00:53.710 
quickly now one thing about this gun

00:00:53.710 --> 00:00:55.500 
quickly now one thing about this gun
that<00:00:53.859> I<00:00:53.979> found<00:00:54.309> very<00:00:54.399> very<00:00:54.789> useful<00:00:55.059> is<00:00:55.479> the

00:00:55.500 --> 00:00:55.510 
that I found very very useful is the

00:00:55.510 --> 00:00:58.500 
that I found very very useful is the
very<00:00:56.019> short<00:00:56.350> reload<00:00:56.799> time<00:00:57.039> that<00:00:57.280> has<00:00:57.579> I<00:00:57.879> don't

00:00:58.500 --> 00:00:58.510 
very short reload time that has I don't

00:00:58.510 --> 00:01:00.719 
very short reload time that has I don't
know<00:00:58.719> the<00:00:58.870> exact<00:00:59.289> times<00:00:59.559> because<00:01:00.069> the<00:01:00.370> stats

00:01:00.719 --> 00:01:00.729 
know the exact times because the stats

00:01:00.729 --> 00:01:03.299 
know the exact times because the stats
are<00:01:00.969> not<00:01:01.239> simple<00:01:01.839> but<00:01:02.109> I<00:01:02.499> guess<00:01:02.829> it<00:01:03.010> will<00:01:03.129> be

00:01:03.299 --> 00:01:03.309 
are not simple but I guess it will be

00:01:03.309 --> 00:01:05.820 
are not simple but I guess it will be
around<00:01:03.399> two<00:01:03.789> seconds<00:01:04.360> in<00:01:04.479> there<00:01:05.199> is<00:01:05.379> really

00:01:05.820 --> 00:01:05.830 
around two seconds in there is really

00:01:05.830 --> 00:01:08.219 
around two seconds in there is really
really<00:01:06.130> fast<00:01:06.399> but<00:01:07.390> yeah<00:01:07.570> you<00:01:07.630> will<00:01:07.840> definitely

00:01:08.219 --> 00:01:08.229 
really fast but yeah you will definitely

00:01:08.229 --> 00:01:12.060 
really fast but yeah you will definitely
need<00:01:08.560> that<00:01:08.920> fast<00:01:09.909> reload<00:01:10.360> because<00:01:11.259> a<00:01:11.469> fire<00:01:11.829> set

00:01:12.060 --> 00:01:12.070 
need that fast reload because a fire set

00:01:12.070 --> 00:01:14.340 
need that fast reload because a fire set
900<00:01:12.640> rounds<00:01:12.789> per<00:01:13.060> minute<00:01:13.180> and<00:01:13.450> only<00:01:13.780> has<00:01:13.899> 20

00:01:14.340 --> 00:01:14.350 
900 rounds per minute and only has 20

00:01:14.350 --> 00:01:17.130 
900 rounds per minute and only has 20
bullets<00:01:14.649> and<00:01:14.890> 21<00:01:15.399> in<00:01:15.579> the<00:01:16.060> chamber<00:01:16.570> you<00:01:16.990> will

00:01:17.130 --> 00:01:17.140 
bullets and 21 in the chamber you will

00:01:17.140 --> 00:01:19.920 
bullets and 21 in the chamber you will
definitely<00:01:17.530> need<00:01:17.740> that<00:01:18.280> short<00:01:19.210> reload<00:01:19.659> time

00:01:19.920 --> 00:01:19.930 
definitely need that short reload time

00:01:19.930 --> 00:01:22.139 
definitely need that short reload time
now<00:01:20.350> why<00:01:20.560> does<00:01:20.829> a<00:01:20.859> gun<00:01:21.159> appeals<00:01:21.609> to<00:01:21.820> me<00:01:21.939> is

00:01:22.139 --> 00:01:22.149 
now why does a gun appeals to me is

00:01:22.149 --> 00:01:24.359 
now why does a gun appeals to me is
because<00:01:22.359> it<00:01:22.600> has<00:01:22.659> a<00:01:22.780> built-in<00:01:23.350> suppressor<00:01:24.039> now

00:01:24.359 --> 00:01:24.369 
because it has a built-in suppressor now

00:01:24.369 --> 00:01:26.010 
because it has a built-in suppressor now
if<00:01:24.490> you<00:01:24.579> watch<00:01:24.820> on<00:01:25.000> my<00:01:25.210> other<00:01:25.359> game<00:01:25.630> place<00:01:25.840> then

00:01:26.010 --> 00:01:26.020 
if you watch on my other game place then

00:01:26.020 --> 00:01:27.690 
if you watch on my other game place then
you<00:01:26.109> will<00:01:26.229> know<00:01:26.350> that<00:01:26.560> I<00:01:26.740> will<00:01:26.799> almost<00:01:27.159> always

00:01:27.690 --> 00:01:27.700 
you will know that I will almost always

00:01:27.700 --> 00:01:30.420 
you will know that I will almost always
use<00:01:28.149> the<00:01:28.180> suppressor<00:01:28.869> in<00:01:29.049> for<00:01:29.590> each<00:01:29.829> and<00:01:30.189> every

00:01:30.420 --> 00:01:30.430 
use the suppressor in for each and every

00:01:30.430 --> 00:01:32.219 
use the suppressor in for each and every
gun<00:01:30.609> because<00:01:30.880> I<00:01:30.939> think<00:01:31.119> it's<00:01:31.479> very<00:01:31.570> important

00:01:32.219 --> 00:01:32.229 
gun because I think it's very important

00:01:32.229 --> 00:01:35.039 
gun because I think it's very important
the<00:01:32.649> stay<00:01:32.859> of<00:01:33.039> the<00:01:33.070> mini-map<00:01:33.549> to<00:01:34.240> actually

the stay of the mini-map to actually

00:01:35.049 --> 00:01:36.840 
the stay of the mini-map to actually
flank<00:01:35.380> your<00:01:35.560> opponents<00:01:36.070> without<00:01:36.189> them<00:01:36.670> being

00:01:36.840 --> 00:01:36.850 
flank your opponents without them being

aware of where you are so with this gun

00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:42.029 
aware of where you are so with this gun
have<00:01:40.149> a<00:01:40.179> nun<00:01:40.329> building<00:01:40.719> suppressor<00:01:41.289> meaning

00:01:42.029 --> 00:01:42.039 
have a nun building suppressor meaning

00:01:42.039 --> 00:01:43.740 
have a nun building suppressor meaning
that<00:01:42.070> you<00:01:42.369> always<00:01:42.729> have<00:01:43.090> a<00:01:43.119> suppressor<00:01:43.570> and

00:01:43.740 --> 00:01:43.750 
that you always have a suppressor and

00:01:43.750 --> 00:01:45.929 
that you always have a suppressor and
you<00:01:43.869> can<00:01:44.020> use<00:01:44.229> the<00:01:44.469> suppressor<00:01:45.310> slope<00:01:45.700> where

00:01:45.929 --> 00:01:45.939 
you can use the suppressor slope where

00:01:45.939 --> 00:01:47.249 
you can use the suppressor slope where
you<00:01:46.030> wouldn't<00:01:46.329> normally<00:01:46.570> use<00:01:47.049> your

you wouldn't normally use your

00:01:47.259 --> 00:01:49.380 
you wouldn't normally use your

00:01:49.380 --> 00:01:49.390 
suppressor for a different attachment

00:01:49.390 --> 00:01:52.529 
suppressor for a different attachment
which<00:01:49.929> does<00:01:50.320> make<00:01:50.350> the<00:01:51.009> gun<00:01:51.399> a<00:01:51.609> bit<00:01:51.670> more<00:01:52.299> of<00:01:52.450> a

00:01:52.529 --> 00:01:52.539 
which does make the gun a bit more of a

00:01:52.539 --> 00:01:54.840 
which does make the gun a bit more of a
viable<00:01:52.899> option<00:01:53.109> now<00:01:54.070> the<00:01:54.130> technique<00:01:54.670> you'll

00:01:54.840 --> 00:01:54.850 
viable option now the technique you'll

00:01:54.850 --> 00:01:56.880 
viable option now the technique you'll
see<00:01:55.119> me<00:01:55.329> using<00:01:55.600> throughout<00:01:56.020> this<00:01:56.229> video<00:01:56.439> and

00:01:56.880 --> 00:01:56.890 
see me using throughout this video and

00:01:56.890 --> 00:02:00.809 
see me using throughout this video and
particularly<00:01:57.609> here<00:01:58.030> is<00:01:59.310> killing<00:02:00.310> one<00:02:00.520> enemy

00:02:00.809 --> 00:02:00.819 
particularly here is killing one enemy

00:02:00.819 --> 00:02:03.419 
particularly here is killing one enemy
than<00:02:01.299> going<00:02:01.659> back<00:02:01.869> to<00:02:02.020> cover<00:02:02.289> going<00:02:03.130> for<00:02:03.310> the

00:02:03.419 --> 00:02:03.429 
than going back to cover going for the

00:02:03.429 --> 00:02:05.520 
than going back to cover going for the
fast<00:02:03.729> reload<00:02:04.119> and<00:02:04.390> I'm<00:02:04.509> taking<00:02:04.929> out<00:02:05.259> the

00:02:05.520 --> 00:02:05.530 
fast reload and I'm taking out the

00:02:05.530 --> 00:02:08.249 
fast reload and I'm taking out the
enemies<00:02:06.100> that<00:02:06.249> are<00:02:06.310> left<00:02:06.729> because<00:02:07.689> of<00:02:07.869> this

00:02:08.249 --> 00:02:08.259 
enemies that are left because of this

00:02:08.259 --> 00:02:11.610 
enemies that are left because of this
extremely<00:02:09.250> small<00:02:09.789> magazine<00:02:10.270> capacity<00:02:10.690> you

00:02:11.610 --> 00:02:11.620 
extremely small magazine capacity you

00:02:11.620 --> 00:02:13.410 
extremely small magazine capacity you
will<00:02:11.800> need<00:02:12.010> to<00:02:12.190> do<00:02:12.370> that<00:02:12.400> because<00:02:12.790> you<00:02:13.120> can

00:02:13.410 --> 00:02:13.420 
will need to do that because you can

00:02:13.420 --> 00:02:15.630 
will need to do that because you can
take<00:02:13.660> out<00:02:13.930> multiple<00:02:14.530> opponents<00:02:15.040> at

00:02:15.630 --> 00:02:15.640 
take out multiple opponents at

00:02:15.640 --> 00:02:18.390 
take out multiple opponents at
ones<00:02:15.760> because<00:02:16.270> yeah<00:02:16.810> it's<00:02:17.470> just<00:02:17.830> hard<00:02:18.100> to<00:02:18.160> do

00:02:18.390 --> 00:02:18.400 
ones because yeah it's just hard to do

00:02:18.400 --> 00:02:22.020 
ones because yeah it's just hard to do
with<00:02:18.880> only<00:02:19.270> 12<00:02:19.780> or<00:02:20.200> 20<00:02:20.980> rounds<00:02:21.850> in<00:02:22.000> the

00:02:22.020 --> 00:02:22.030 
with only 12 or 20 rounds in the

00:02:22.030 --> 00:02:24.900 
with only 12 or 20 rounds in the
magazine<00:02:22.450> now<00:02:23.440> when<00:02:23.590> I<00:02:23.620> first<00:02:23.950> unlock<00:02:24.370> begun<00:02:24.760> I

00:02:24.900 --> 00:02:24.910 
magazine now when I first unlock begun I

00:02:24.910 --> 00:02:27.660 
magazine now when I first unlock begun I
thought<00:02:25.209> I<00:02:25.240> would<00:02:25.510> use<00:02:25.720> it<00:02:25.959> for<00:02:26.670> close-quarter

00:02:27.660 --> 00:02:27.670 
thought I would use it for close-quarter

00:02:27.670 --> 00:02:29.880 
thought I would use it for close-quarter
combat<00:02:27.700> so<00:02:28.480> I<00:02:28.510> will<00:02:28.810> play<00:02:29.050> team<00:02:29.290> deathmatch<00:02:29.319> or

00:02:29.880 --> 00:02:29.890 
combat so I will play team deathmatch or

00:02:29.890 --> 00:02:32.610 
combat so I will play team deathmatch or
domination<00:02:30.370> since<00:02:31.180> the<00:02:31.420> hipfire<00:02:31.630> accuracy<00:02:32.200> as

00:02:32.610 --> 00:02:32.620 
domination since the hipfire accuracy as

00:02:32.620 --> 00:02:34.949 
domination since the hipfire accuracy as
you<00:02:32.800> can<00:02:32.920> see<00:02:33.100> air<00:02:33.250> is<00:02:33.400> really<00:02:34.180> really<00:02:34.390> high<00:02:34.630> so

00:02:34.949 --> 00:02:34.959 
you can see air is really really high so

00:02:34.959 --> 00:02:37.140 
you can see air is really really high so
it<00:02:35.410> makes<00:02:35.620> it<00:02:35.800> very<00:02:35.860> good<00:02:36.280> for<00:02:36.340> close-quarter

00:02:37.140 --> 00:02:37.150 
it makes it very good for close-quarter

00:02:37.150 --> 00:02:39.930 
it makes it very good for close-quarter
fighting<00:02:37.500> now<00:02:38.500> as<00:02:38.650> I<00:02:38.680> play<00:02:38.980> more<00:02:39.370> rounds<00:02:39.790> with

00:02:39.930 --> 00:02:39.940 
fighting now as I play more rounds with

00:02:39.940 --> 00:02:42.660 
fighting now as I play more rounds with
the<00:02:39.970> gun<00:02:40.270> I<00:02:40.860> discovered<00:02:41.860> that<00:02:41.890> you<00:02:42.459> could

00:02:42.660 --> 00:02:42.670 
the gun I discovered that you could

00:02:42.670 --> 00:02:45.059 
the gun I discovered that you could
actually<00:02:42.880> take<00:02:43.630> out<00:02:43.870> the<00:02:44.080> ponens<00:02:44.530> with<00:02:44.860> on

00:02:45.059 --> 00:02:45.069 
actually take out the ponens with on

00:02:45.069 --> 00:02:48.150 
actually take out the ponens with on
longer<00:02:45.880> ranges<00:02:46.330> if<00:02:46.540> you<00:02:47.050> perspire<00:02:47.590> this<00:02:47.890> gun

00:02:48.150 --> 00:02:48.160 
longer ranges if you perspire this gun

00:02:48.160 --> 00:02:50.430 
longer ranges if you perspire this gun
correctly<00:02:48.730> now<00:02:49.239> you<00:02:49.330> don't<00:02:49.510> really<00:02:49.810> see<00:02:50.170> it<00:02:50.290> in

00:02:50.430 --> 00:02:50.440 
correctly now you don't really see it in

00:02:50.440 --> 00:02:52.680 
correctly now you don't really see it in
the<00:02:50.560> stats<00:02:50.860> but<00:02:51.160> they<00:02:51.580> believe<00:02:52.030> me<00:02:52.239> if<00:02:52.330> I<00:02:52.450> say

00:02:52.680 --> 00:02:52.690 
the stats but they believe me if I say

00:02:52.690 --> 00:02:54.810 
the stats but they believe me if I say
that<00:02:52.720> this<00:02:53.080> gun<00:02:53.350> is<00:02:53.380> really<00:02:53.980> really<00:02:54.190> accurate

00:02:54.810 --> 00:02:54.820 
that this gun is really really accurate

00:02:54.820 --> 00:02:57.720 
that this gun is really really accurate
and<00:02:55.000> it's<00:02:55.570> also<00:02:55.930> very<00:02:56.290> easy<00:02:57.040> to<00:02:57.400> take<00:02:57.580> out

00:02:57.720 --> 00:02:57.730 
and it's also very easy to take out

00:02:57.730 --> 00:02:59.820 
and it's also very easy to take out
opponents<00:02:57.970> that<00:02:58.540> are<00:02:58.600> a<00:02:59.019> bit<00:02:59.050> longer<00:02:59.530> or

00:02:59.820 --> 00:02:59.830 
opponents that are a bit longer or

00:02:59.830 --> 00:03:04.500 
opponents that are a bit longer or
medium<00:03:00.519> ranged<00:03:00.940> far<00:03:01.600> away<00:03:02.019> from<00:03:02.080> you<00:03:03.209> now<00:03:04.209> for

00:03:04.500 --> 00:03:04.510 
medium ranged far away from you now for

00:03:04.510 --> 00:03:06.990 
medium ranged far away from you now for
the<00:03:04.630> attachments<00:03:05.290> I<00:03:05.380> would<00:03:05.769> recommend<00:03:06.070> not

00:03:06.990 --> 00:03:07.000 
the attachments I would recommend not

00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:09.330 
the attachments I would recommend not
using<00:03:07.060> any<00:03:07.720> sites<00:03:08.080> of<00:03:08.350> course<00:03:08.590> this<00:03:09.100> is<00:03:09.310> just

00:03:09.330 --> 00:03:09.340 
using any sites of course this is just

00:03:09.340 --> 00:03:11.280 
using any sites of course this is just
what<00:03:09.760> I<00:03:09.940> like<00:03:10.180> to<00:03:10.330> use<00:03:10.480> I<00:03:10.690> really<00:03:11.019> like<00:03:11.170> the

00:03:11.280 --> 00:03:11.290 
what I like to use I really like the

00:03:11.290 --> 00:03:13.140 
what I like to use I really like the
iron<00:03:11.440> sights<00:03:11.739> but<00:03:12.370> if<00:03:12.519> you<00:03:12.670> more<00:03:12.910> like<00:03:13.120> a

00:03:13.140 --> 00:03:13.150 
iron sights but if you more like a

00:03:13.150 --> 00:03:16.259 
iron sights but if you more like a
reflex<00:03:14.019> sight<00:03:14.410> guy<00:03:14.650> then<00:03:14.980> go<00:03:15.370> for<00:03:15.640> that<00:03:15.910> site

00:03:16.259 --> 00:03:16.269 
reflex sight guy then go for that site

00:03:16.269 --> 00:03:18.720 
reflex sight guy then go for that site
now<00:03:16.810> a<00:03:16.840> laser<00:03:17.140> sight<00:03:17.440> could<00:03:17.709> come<00:03:17.980> in<00:03:18.130> handy<00:03:18.160> if

00:03:18.720 --> 00:03:18.730 
now a laser sight could come in handy if

00:03:18.730 --> 00:03:21.360 
now a laser sight could come in handy if
going<00:03:19.450> for<00:03:19.750> the<00:03:20.049> close-quarter<00:03:20.590> kills<00:03:21.010> but

00:03:21.360 --> 00:03:21.370 
going for the close-quarter kills but

00:03:21.370 --> 00:03:23.850 
going for the close-quarter kills but
because<00:03:22.180> I<00:03:22.360> think<00:03:22.930> that<00:03:23.110> this<00:03:23.440> gun<00:03:23.709> has<00:03:23.739> a

00:03:23.850 --> 00:03:23.860 
because I think that this gun has a

00:03:23.860 --> 00:03:26.190 
because I think that this gun has a
really<00:03:24.130> high<00:03:24.220> hip<00:03:24.670> hip<00:03:24.970> fire<00:03:25.209> accuracy<00:03:25.570> the

00:03:26.190 --> 00:03:26.200 
really high hip hip fire accuracy the

00:03:26.200 --> 00:03:29.039 
really high hip hip fire accuracy the
laser<00:03:27.010> sight<00:03:27.340> would<00:03:27.700> not<00:03:27.970> really<00:03:28.390> help<00:03:28.930> that

00:03:29.039 --> 00:03:29.049 
laser sight would not really help that

00:03:29.049 --> 00:03:31.800 
laser sight would not really help that
much<00:03:29.440> because<00:03:29.890> it<00:03:30.190> would<00:03:30.489> mainly<00:03:30.760> go<00:03:31.360> and<00:03:31.600> give

00:03:31.800 --> 00:03:31.810 
much because it would mainly go and give

00:03:31.810 --> 00:03:33.960 
much because it would mainly go and give
your<00:03:31.959> position<00:03:32.500> away<00:03:32.739> because<00:03:33.400> this<00:03:33.760> gun

00:03:33.960 --> 00:03:33.970 
your position away because this gun

00:03:33.970 --> 00:03:35.850 
your position away because this gun
already<00:03:34.329> has<00:03:34.540> a<00:03:34.570> good<00:03:34.870> hip<00:03:35.079> high<00:03:35.260> accuracy<00:03:35.560> so

00:03:35.850 --> 00:03:35.860 
already has a good hip high accuracy so

00:03:35.860 --> 00:03:38.039 
already has a good hip high accuracy so
don't<00:03:36.040> see<00:03:36.250> really<00:03:36.730> appointing<00:03:37.390> using<00:03:37.840> this

00:03:38.039 --> 00:03:38.049 
don't see really appointing using this

00:03:38.049 --> 00:03:40.229 
don't see really appointing using this
no<00:03:38.650> for<00:03:38.890> the<00:03:38.980> underbarrel<00:03:39.370> attachment<00:03:39.549> i<00:03:40.090> will

00:03:40.229 --> 00:03:40.239 
no for the underbarrel attachment i will

00:03:40.239 --> 00:03:42.660 
no for the underbarrel attachment i will
recommend<00:03:40.420> using<00:03:40.900> an<00:03:41.140> Ergo<00:03:41.530> grip<00:03:41.560> to<00:03:42.250> help<00:03:42.459> you

00:03:42.660 --> 00:03:42.670 
recommend using an Ergo grip to help you

00:03:42.670 --> 00:03:45.720 
recommend using an Ergo grip to help you
maintain<00:03:43.480> that<00:03:44.049> stability<00:03:44.410> at<00:03:45.010> longer<00:03:45.340> ranges

00:03:45.720 --> 00:03:45.730 
maintain that stability at longer ranges

00:03:45.730 --> 00:03:48.870 
maintain that stability at longer ranges
even<00:03:46.120> more<00:03:46.739> so<00:03:47.739> overall<00:03:48.190> I<00:03:48.220> think<00:03:48.370> this<00:03:48.700> is<00:03:48.820> a

00:03:48.870 --> 00:03:48.880 
even more so overall I think this is a

00:03:48.880 --> 00:03:50.850 
even more so overall I think this is a
pretty<00:03:49.060> good<00:03:49.390> gun<00:03:49.660> and<00:03:49.900> it's<00:03:50.440> definitely

00:03:50.850 --> 00:03:50.860 
pretty good gun and it's definitely

00:03:50.860 --> 00:03:53.400
