00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.520
 very good two we are in minecraft bots 

00:00:02.550 --> 00:00:06.930
 random and let's see a mod a mod that 

00:00:05.520 --> 00:00:10.620
 We saw a while ago that I was super 

00:00:06.930 --> 00:00:13.639
 cool and is the one with these bikes that we can 

00:00:10.620 --> 00:00:16.109
 create on the top of the nose the villagers 

00:00:13.639 --> 00:00:18.090
 we take away the law and we can plant the 

00:00:16.109 --> 00:00:19.859
 and such but they have been updated and now 

00:00:18.090 --> 00:00:21.990
 he gave some pretty cool little thing now 

00:00:19.859 --> 00:00:23.699
 let's see first the basics that is what 

00:00:21.990 --> 00:00:26.400
 to be able to remove the nose 

00:00:23.699 --> 00:00:28.580
 your yes with a pair of scissors of these we do 

00:00:26.400 --> 00:00:32.070
 shift and right click 

00:00:28.580 --> 00:00:35.540
 his nose falls off poor he is 

00:00:32.070 --> 00:00:37.880
 run out of nose and we can plant what 

00:00:35.540 --> 00:00:40.250
 is to do it here for example 

00:00:37.880 --> 00:00:42.740
 we plant it itself there is a plant though 

00:00:40.250 --> 00:00:44.290
 it does not look and it grows very little 

00:00:42.740 --> 00:00:46.000
 little bit 

00:00:44.290 --> 00:00:47.290
 as you see it grows until it is done 

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:48.579
 big the size of one of these 

00:00:47.290 --> 00:00:50.589
 programs 

00:00:48.579 --> 00:00:52.269
 if I remember correctly and then went to 

00:00:50.589 --> 00:00:54.699
 have to be testing the 

00:00:52.269 --> 00:00:56.289
 new things and they are super cool time 

00:00:54.699 --> 00:00:58.719
 how can we see different 

00:00:56.289 --> 00:01:00.429
 guys, this we've already seen, let's wait 

00:00:58.719 --> 00:01:02.019
 large become'm not sure 

00:01:00.429 --> 00:01:03.839
 these if this could be done before 

00:01:02.019 --> 00:01:06.220
 that now it turns out that with bonnie milk 

00:01:03.839 --> 00:01:08.080
 grows faster I have to use 

00:01:06.220 --> 00:01:09.610
 very much sofÃ­a 

00:01:08.080 --> 00:01:12.270
 but as you see they are growing 

00:01:09.610 --> 00:01:12.270
 growing is growing 

00:01:12.730 --> 00:01:17.200
 this grows the same but at a slower pace 

00:01:15.220 --> 00:01:18.820
 because they are riding 1000 and 

00:01:17.200 --> 00:01:20.050
 we have a villager the question is that 

00:01:18.820 --> 00:01:22.550
 When they do not have a nose, we can not 

00:01:20.050 --> 00:01:24.680
 trade with them that's the bad thing 

00:01:22.550 --> 00:01:27.420
 as you see let me alone I have lost my 

00:01:24.680 --> 00:01:32.680
 nose I can not give you the 

00:01:27.420 --> 00:01:34.650
 body parts we could not put 

00:01:32.680 --> 00:01:36.720
 before 

00:01:34.650 --> 00:01:39.300
 As you can see, it is open to have 

00:01:36.720 --> 00:01:41.430
 people with the vitola villager but now 

00:01:39.300 --> 00:01:44.250
 it has function and before it had no 

00:01:41.430 --> 00:01:46.470
 function and that is now dis mega 

00:01:44.250 --> 00:01:50.790
 duster that we are going away 

00:01:46.470 --> 00:01:52.320
 and we're going to put the sound like that when 

00:01:50.790 --> 00:01:56.300
 full medialdea fence is supposed to 

00:01:52.320 --> 00:01:58.930
 we make the villagers 

00:01:56.300 --> 00:01:58.930
 you are 

00:02:01.120 --> 00:02:07.590
 it's a lot of god of normal not but 

00:02:04.960 --> 00:02:07.590
 we have this 

00:02:11.049 --> 00:02:15.170
 there is an emerald make us do the 

00:02:13.189 --> 00:02:18.189
 Villagers sound is great I 

00:02:15.170 --> 00:02:18.189
 it seemed super cool this 

00:02:18.190 --> 00:02:21.880
 to find emeralds is simply 

00:02:20.410 --> 00:02:24.160
 the nose the villager put this is 

00:02:21.880 --> 00:02:26.560
 great before this was not there and added 

00:02:24.160 --> 00:02:27.850
 one last thing that is a mine like 

00:02:26.560 --> 00:02:30.280
 You see the boat is very cool to make you 

00:02:27.850 --> 00:02:31.810
 your own villages because it requires 

00:02:30.280 --> 00:02:33.730
 analyze a few you go to another 

00:02:31.810 --> 00:02:36.070
 site and the plants and you make yourself a 

00:02:33.730 --> 00:02:38.260
 populated yourself is very cool but 

00:02:36.070 --> 00:02:40.810
 now a little thing that is more alone 

00:02:38.260 --> 00:02:43.900
 although it is here that we can do 

00:02:40.810 --> 00:02:45.910
 which is with a brown wool a nose 

00:02:43.900 --> 00:02:48.250
 a stick and two of these crystals 

00:02:45.910 --> 00:02:51.400
 let's make these glasses that is the 

00:02:48.250 --> 00:02:53.190
 super nose would not be serious so let's put it 

00:02:51.400 --> 00:02:56.990
 this is nothing, do not worry about that 

00:02:53.190 --> 00:03:00.050
 and by putting this on as I do 

00:02:56.990 --> 00:03:02.030
 first let's see her so it's very 

00:03:00.050 --> 00:03:04.700
 rare that as you can see is a nose of these 

00:03:02.030 --> 00:03:07.640
 like the typical joke wings and it's 

00:03:04.700 --> 00:03:09.940
 pretty cool look when you put it pass 

00:03:07.640 --> 00:03:09.940
 weird things 

00:03:10.330 --> 00:03:14.819
 music sounds 

00:03:12.780 --> 00:03:18.140
 I did not stop jumping I'm not jumping 

00:03:14.819 --> 00:03:18.140
 jump in the sun 

00:03:19.790 --> 00:03:23.469
 if I remove the interface you do not see 

00:03:23.810 --> 00:03:27.260
 spectrum gives it to me 

00:03:29.650 --> 00:03:37.090
 and if villagers are passing by 

00:03:33.480 --> 00:03:39.250
 oh my god so much time 

00:03:37.090 --> 00:03:42.620
 it's great if we take it off we leave 

00:03:39.250 --> 00:03:45.459
 of jumping and for music and everything 

00:03:42.620 --> 00:03:45.459
 as you see 

00:03:45.460 --> 00:03:49.890
 Oh, good, please, it 's great 

00:03:50.470 --> 00:03:54.330
 it's a walk like a temple 

00:03:55.620 --> 00:04:01.020
 but he has made me thank you very much 

00:03:58.920 --> 00:04:03.630
 I am already tell me what function has to 

00:04:01.020 --> 00:04:05.959
 pass villagers has followed here in 

00:04:03.630 --> 00:04:05.959
 medium 

00:04:06.140 --> 00:04:11.930
 an area will pass something with its back 

00:04:08.880 --> 00:04:13.730
 no no no 

00:04:11.930 --> 00:04:15.680
 if all of animation I've seen 

00:04:13.730 --> 00:04:20.720
 Really 

00:04:15.680 --> 00:04:23.030
 oh how nice but curious is it useful for 

00:04:20.720 --> 00:04:26.300
 make your terrorist villages of the 

00:04:23.030 --> 00:04:28.120
 super nose the glasses super nose is a 

00:04:26.300 --> 00:04:29.740
 illuminated 

00:04:28.120 --> 00:04:31.740
 if at least they gave me things for free or 

00:04:29.740 --> 00:04:34.030
 something 

00:04:31.740 --> 00:04:35.440
 It does not stop from making you jump, it's also a 

00:04:34.030 --> 00:04:37.890
 ax mine 

00:04:35.440 --> 00:04:37.890
 You liked it
