00:00:00.589 --> 00:00:04.700
 in this video tutorial tutorial we are going to learn to be a 

00:00:04.700 --> 00:00:09.510
 clean installation of windows 7 for this we are going to need a madness is 

00:00:09.510 --> 00:00:11.440
 rememore or extreme speak to you 

00:00:11.440 --> 00:00:14.240
 or else get where we can motivate 

00:00:14.240 --> 00:00:17.510
 one is that we are inside the first thing we are going to do we are going to select 

00:00:17.510 --> 00:00:22.240
 our country the sector the type of keyboard we have and the language in the 

00:00:22.240 --> 00:00:26.860
 that we're going to install our windows after that we're going to give next 

00:00:26.860 --> 00:00:29.860
 Install Now 

00:00:31.210 --> 00:00:35.860
 we begin to see wait for the installation program to begin 

00:00:35.860 --> 00:00:40.600
 by then we start there to move our positions and he 

00:00:40.600 --> 00:00:42.570
 for example in this case 

00:00:42.570 --> 00:00:46.130
 this I have very induce the one that would allow me to choose the 

00:00:46.130 --> 00:00:48.840
 the windows version that we want 

00:00:48.840 --> 00:00:53.350
 I select Windows 7 ultimate but this one will know what to do 

00:00:53.350 --> 00:00:56.860
 after we arrived this screen we are going to select an installation 

00:00:56.860 --> 00:00:57.820
 advanced 

00:00:57.820 --> 00:01:01.500
 and there we are going to select the hard drive is not that we want to be side go 

00:01:01.500 --> 00:01:02.920
 dignity options 

00:01:02.920 --> 00:01:06.960
 and there we will select new to create a new match 

00:01:06.960 --> 00:01:10.479
 there we assign the size that we want by default until the 

00:01:10.479 --> 00:01:11.340
 maximum 

00:01:11.340 --> 00:01:12.970
 we wait for him to believe 

00:01:12.970 --> 00:01:16.700
 We select the newly created procession and click on 

00:01:16.700 --> 00:01:20.220
 format to avoid any conflict to parks left 

00:01:20.850 --> 00:01:22.870
 and in such a way as it should be 

00:01:22.870 --> 00:01:25.110
 we wait for it to finish formatting 

00:01:25.110 --> 00:01:28.180
 and after this we give the next button 

00:01:40.840 --> 00:01:45.800
 well it's over we're going to next and here we wait for it to finish all that 

00:01:45.800 --> 00:01:50.039
 process here and we do not have to intervene in absolutely anything 

00:01:50.039 --> 00:01:52.430
 and we will simply have to wait 

00:01:52.430 --> 00:01:56.210
 You have to watch video as it is a more or less closed process 

00:01:56.210 --> 00:02:00.560
 depending on the machine in which we are running the installation 

00:02:01.080 --> 00:02:04.070
 It will take different time 

00:02:04.070 --> 00:02:09.910
 So here what I did was cut the video for what purpose it will be 

00:02:09.910 --> 00:02:13.240
 a little faster in the installation but like 

00:02:13.240 --> 00:02:16.490
 depending on the machine where you are not installing abr is what is going to 

00:02:16.490 --> 00:02:18.429
 take the 

00:02:18.429 --> 00:02:21.429
 the process 

00:02:54.999 --> 00:02:59.839
 after this is going to learn if the system and we are not going to press 

00:02:59.839 --> 00:03:05.389
 nothing for the historian to enter directly again and he can continue with 

00:03:05.389 --> 00:03:09.679
 with this occasion we do get a message that if we want to start 

00:03:09.679 --> 00:03:11.779
 waste and threw some 

00:03:11.779 --> 00:03:16.280
 something yes we do not ignore it because we do hit a key 

00:03:16.280 --> 00:03:20.410
 then going to re-enter installation program we were going to have to go back 

00:03:20.410 --> 00:03:22.780
 to format ii of that we will not go out 

00:03:22.780 --> 00:03:24.420
 then what we have to do 

00:03:24.420 --> 00:03:28.849
 is to let him alone the system has delivered an accident where he has to 

00:03:28.849 --> 00:03:32.829
 enter we do not have to remove the disc we do not have to remove the ue- they sell 

00:03:32.829 --> 00:03:35.829
 and let the program continue with the installation 

00:04:06.249 --> 00:04:07.939
 in the East 

00:04:07.939 --> 00:04:12.530
 in this phase of the installation it may also be that it takes a little 

00:04:12.530 --> 00:04:17.109
 move from this window this is because you are already setting the last things 

00:04:17.109 --> 00:04:21.790
 you need to access the iger face with stories after it ends 

00:04:21.790 --> 00:04:25.470
 this we're going to restart the good machine again it's actually going to 

00:04:25.470 --> 00:04:26.900
 restart solar 

00:04:26.900 --> 00:04:31.430
 again we do not pay attention to it so we want to start from the simple we 

00:04:31.430 --> 00:04:32.270
 serve 

00:04:32.270 --> 00:04:37.320
 and we wait here for circuits after the windows window appears 

00:04:37.319 --> 00:04:40.439
 with the message saying running away if all 

00:04:40.439 --> 00:04:43.889
 are supposed to appear something of what 

00:04:43.889 --> 00:04:47.169
 the installation program is preparing the ex the team for the 

00:04:47.169 --> 00:04:50.169
 first boot or something like that we let them work 

00:04:50.960 --> 00:04:52.919
 and after this 

00:04:52.919 --> 00:04:55.090
 he will not ask us for a 

00:04:55.090 --> 00:04:56.620
 our data from 

00:04:56.620 --> 00:04:58.460
 I give things away 

00:04:58.460 --> 00:05:02.029
 which we are going to fill, as for example here 

00:05:02.029 --> 00:05:05.789
 I'm going to use the same name as joan who chooses her in the example 

00:05:05.789 --> 00:05:07.610
 In the next 

00:05:07.610 --> 00:05:12.610
 and here we can put a password is optional but recommended 

00:05:12.610 --> 00:05:16.240
 here we are going to put the key the product is is for example 

00:05:16.240 --> 00:05:20.680
 if it's a laptop in the back it's a computer writer in the part 

00:05:20.680 --> 00:05:21.410
 sideways 

00:05:21.410 --> 00:05:23.610
 on a windows decal 

00:05:23.610 --> 00:05:28.490
 if we buy nostrum windows apart there should also come in the box 

00:05:28.490 --> 00:05:33.349
 and after these configurations this one of each one depending on the place 

00:05:33.349 --> 00:05:35.650
 where you are installing two as to 

00:05:35.650 --> 00:05:36.889
 the 

00:05:36.889 --> 00:05:41.220
 pelusso schedule that we are going to need this the type of reptile we have connects 

00:05:41.219 --> 00:05:45.340
 to the team this is to see which major configuration equipment in total was 

00:05:45.340 --> 00:05:49.259
 basically nothing more than following the instructions that are appearing in 

00:05:49.259 --> 00:05:52.259
 screen 

00:05:53.550 --> 00:05:56.349
 here we wait for everything to be set 

00:05:56.349 --> 00:06:00.370
 and after this is going to start our desktop for the first time 

00:06:00.370 --> 00:06:03.550
 and we will be able to work on windows 7 now yes 

00:06:04.729 --> 00:06:08.620
 the recommended thing after an installation would be to restart 

00:06:08.620 --> 00:06:10.310
 the team and then already com 

00:06:10.310 --> 00:06:11.919
 begin to configure 

00:06:11.919 --> 00:06:14.060
 but he is obese 

00:06:14.060 --> 00:06:17.840
 more than an optional, everyone can do it as they wish 

00:06:18.430 --> 00:06:19.570
 i 3 

00:06:19.570 --> 00:06:24.080
 yes the teas do not want to give up anna they can continue can start to work 

00:06:24.080 --> 00:06:24.909
 here 

00:06:24.909 --> 00:06:26.409
 directly 

00:06:26.409 --> 00:06:28.509
 and we have the desk 

00:06:28.509 --> 00:06:33.249
 we can work on it we can do what we want is windows 

00:06:33.249 --> 00:06:36.229
 recent president install 

00:06:36.229 --> 00:06:39.490

00:06:40.119 --> 00:06:42.589
