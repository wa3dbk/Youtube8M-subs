00:00:09.370 --> 00:00:15.160
 very good, let's continue with our 

00:00:12.340 --> 00:00:19.390
 videotutorials of the cloning series 

00:00:15.160 --> 00:00:21.780
 of equipment using in this case ws and 

00:00:19.390 --> 00:00:25.080
 norton ghost house server 

00:00:21.780 --> 00:00:27.540
 well in this case the first thing in the 

00:00:25.080 --> 00:00:30.260
 second step that we are going to give we are going to 

00:00:27.540 --> 00:00:32.580
 install the installation kit 

00:00:30.260 --> 00:00:35.640
 automated implementation of 

00:00:32.580 --> 00:00:38.970
 windows or what we also call white 

00:00:35.640 --> 00:00:40.170
 well in this case we have to 

00:00:38.970 --> 00:00:42.150
 search online 

00:00:40.170 --> 00:00:44.940
 we could download it from the page 

00:00:42.150 --> 00:00:47.480
 microsoft or any other where 

00:00:44.940 --> 00:00:51.059
 see in this case the installation kit 

00:00:47.480 --> 00:00:53.190
 automated windows for in this 

00:00:51.059 --> 00:00:57.220
 case for the system that you have for 

00:00:53.190 --> 00:01:01.300
 example I have a windows 2003 server 

00:00:57.220 --> 00:01:03.190
 with the service pack 2 then I must 

00:01:01.300 --> 00:01:06.340
 download this option that I have now 

00:01:03.190 --> 00:01:09.640
 same here I remember to check that yes it is 

00:01:06.340 --> 00:01:12.880
 important that you download the version 

00:01:09.640 --> 00:01:15.100
 correct is well worth what it is worth 

00:01:12.880 --> 00:01:17.230
 tool then this tool by 

00:01:15.100 --> 00:01:19.680
 example as we'll see in another video 

00:01:17.230 --> 00:01:22.930
 tutorial will allow me to automate 

00:01:19.680 --> 00:01:25.270
 create a special file that is going to 

00:01:22.930 --> 00:01:27.040
 allow unattended by 

00:01:25.270 --> 00:01:29.440
 example perform the installation of a 

00:01:27.040 --> 00:01:32.350
 windows is worth for example of a windows 

00:01:29.440 --> 00:01:36.910
 vista or windows 2003 server or a 

00:01:32.350 --> 00:01:39.490
 windows 2008 server etcetera is well worth 

00:01:36.910 --> 00:01:43.240
 but also in this video tutorial what 

00:01:39.490 --> 00:01:46.680
 let's use it because it's in the kit 

00:01:43.240 --> 00:01:49.470
 we supplies 

00:01:46.680 --> 00:01:51.750
 the mini windows boot according to 

00:01:49.470 --> 00:01:54.480
 a mini boot is worth so in this 

00:01:51.750 --> 00:01:56.610
 case we can use it to start 

00:01:54.480 --> 00:01:59.280
 the computers that is our goal 

00:01:56.610 --> 00:02:02.580
 because as we do not have in this case a 

00:01:59.280 --> 00:02:05.280
 cd of windows vista or similar to be able 

00:02:02.580 --> 00:02:07.530
 take the boot image what we're going 

00:02:05.280 --> 00:02:09.619
 to do is this team we are going to take 

00:02:07.530 --> 00:02:12.390
 that image and where we're going to use 

00:02:09.619 --> 00:02:15.360
 and later we will integrate the 

00:02:12.390 --> 00:02:17.550
 application of the gos is worth so that when 

00:02:15.360 --> 00:02:20.459
 boot in the boot clients 

00:02:17.550 --> 00:02:22.709
 automatically this windows image and 

00:02:20.459 --> 00:02:24.270
 How is the gos integrated? 

00:02:22.709 --> 00:02:26.430
 automatically we will tell you what 

00:02:24.270 --> 00:02:29.850
 boot well for a little bit this is the 

00:02:26.430 --> 00:02:32.459
 idea is worth it then we are going to download it 

00:02:29.850 --> 00:02:34.890
 and masters of the internet is as you can 

00:02:32.459 --> 00:02:36.660
 check is an iso file that then 

00:02:34.890 --> 00:02:39.620
 basically what I would do and it would be 

00:02:36.660 --> 00:02:39.620
 record it in a 

00:02:39.650 --> 00:02:45.799
 on a cd or on a DVD, it's worth it 

00:02:43.939 --> 00:02:47.810
 let's state that it is already downloaded 

00:02:45.799 --> 00:02:50.680
 it's recorded on a cd and we're going to insert 

00:02:47.810 --> 00:02:50.680
 said cd 

00:03:07.790 --> 00:03:14.020
 good is already 

00:03:10.500 --> 00:03:17.370
 in fact the installation 

00:03:14.020 --> 00:03:17.370
 we click on finish 

00:03:18.030 --> 00:03:22.310
 and now let's install the other 

00:03:19.709 --> 00:03:22.310
 complement 

00:03:36.010 --> 00:03:40.830
 and in the typical welcome window 

00:03:37.930 --> 00:03:40.830
 following 

00:03:43.810 --> 00:03:50.060
 we accept the terms of the license 

00:03:45.840 --> 00:03:52.340
 we activate next 

00:03:50.060 --> 00:03:56.000
 we put the name 

00:03:52.340 --> 00:03:59.019
 and the organization each one that places 

00:03:56.000 --> 00:03:59.019
 the one that corresponds 

00:04:02.600 --> 00:04:05.320
 following 

00:04:06.690 --> 00:04:09.410
 install 

00:04:10.310 --> 00:04:14.390
 and like any other tool 

00:04:12.980 --> 00:04:17.780
 will install and perform the 

00:04:14.390 --> 00:04:20.350
 configuration of this plugin well 

00:04:17.780 --> 00:04:20.350
 we're going to wait 

00:04:24.630 --> 00:04:27.500
 and finish 

00:04:28.160 --> 00:04:32.170
 Well, we already have both 

00:04:30.050 --> 00:04:35.210
 necessary supplements for now 

00:04:32.170 --> 00:04:36.620
 perform the installation of the kit 

00:04:35.210 --> 00:04:40.300
 automated installation of windows 

00:04:36.620 --> 00:04:40.300
 While we will click on it 

00:04:52.340 --> 00:04:56.480
 well welcome us to the assistant 

00:04:54.620 --> 00:04:59.449

00:05:05.860 --> 00:05:08.860
 following 

00:05:09.580 --> 00:05:15.939
 in this case to perform the tests 

00:05:13.060 --> 00:05:18.610
 of this application and have no problems 

00:05:15.939 --> 00:05:21.129
 with some history we are going to leave the 

00:05:18.610 --> 00:05:23.889
 default folder set file of 

00:05:21.129 --> 00:05:25.509
 programs windows by here and then you 

00:05:23.889 --> 00:05:27.669
 we will indicate that in this case they can 

00:05:25.509 --> 00:05:30.699
 use this tool to all 

00:05:27.669 --> 00:05:32.860
 the users of this team is worth there in 

00:05:30.699 --> 00:05:35.529
 this case to the best because it would interest that 

00:05:32.860 --> 00:05:37.119
 will only use it 

00:05:35.529 --> 00:05:40.089
 the user who has started 

00:05:37.119 --> 00:05:42.699
 session in the system that this case 

00:05:40.089 --> 00:05:45.249
 has rights on behalf of the right 

00:05:42.699 --> 00:05:47.949
 of administration is valid in this case for 

00:05:45.249 --> 00:05:50.360

00:05:55.550 --> 00:05:58.240
 following 

00:05:58.830 --> 00:06:05.900
 and now it's going to proceed as the typical 

00:06:01.020 --> 00:06:05.900
 install and configure the application 

00:06:23.240 --> 00:06:29.849
 ok the installation 

00:06:25.449 --> 00:06:29.849
 has completed we click on close 

00:06:30.020 --> 00:06:38.220
 and we already have in this case the installation 

00:06:35.040 --> 00:06:40.350
 done as you can check in this 

00:06:38.220 --> 00:06:42.780
 in this one 

00:06:40.350 --> 00:06:45.900
 in this material it is very interesting 

00:06:42.780 --> 00:06:47.670
 because we can find on this dvd 

00:06:45.900 --> 00:06:50.130
 Well, documentation that can be 

00:06:47.670 --> 00:06:53.340
 explain the steps of how to 

00:06:50.130 --> 00:06:54.900
 makes an implementation of 

00:06:53.340 --> 00:06:56.550
 windows correct how you get the 

00:06:54.900 --> 00:06:58.590
 images how they are sent to servers 

00:06:56.550 --> 00:07:00.650
 etcetera agree that it is quite 

00:06:58.590 --> 00:07:03.120
 interesting the documentation that comes 

00:07:00.650 --> 00:07:06.800
 Well, we are going to finish 

00:07:03.120 --> 00:07:09.800
 here we are going to close 

00:07:06.800 --> 00:07:13.340
 this window and we'll see what 

00:07:09.800 --> 00:07:17.590
 has been installed we are going to start 

00:07:13.340 --> 00:07:20.750
 all the programs and here we have 

00:07:17.590 --> 00:07:21.830
 microsoft windows there is the agreement 

00:07:20.750 --> 00:07:24.139
 where we have on the one hand the 

00:07:21.830 --> 00:07:26.060
 documentation that has been installed 

00:07:24.139 --> 00:07:28.460
 the system image manager 

00:07:26.060 --> 00:07:30.530
 of windows and the system symbol of 

00:07:28.460 --> 00:07:33.770
 windows p tools that then 

00:07:30.530 --> 00:07:36.409
 we will see how it is used in this case 

00:07:33.770 --> 00:07:38.830
 for what we want to do is worth in this 

00:07:36.409 --> 00:07:41.289
 video tutorial the goal was to install 

00:07:38.830 --> 00:07:43.610
 this application this installation kit 

00:07:41.289 --> 00:07:47.360
 it's good then in the next video 

00:07:43.610 --> 00:07:49.870
 tutorial we will continue advancing vale come
