I believe the closure is like 14 or
something<00:00:35.070> I<00:00:35.340> think<00:00:35.760> it<00:00:36.059> is<00:00:36.210> 14<00:00:36.660> inches<00:00:37.579> yeah

00:00:44.270 --> 00:00:44.280 
like oh I just want 16 inches I just

00:00:44.280 --> 00:00:49.250 
like oh I just want 16 inches I just
want<00:00:44.780> 18<00:00:45.780> inches<00:00:46.140> no<00:00:46.379> it's<00:00:46.710> like<00:00:47.600> 18<00:00:48.600> to<00:00:48.870> 20

00:00:49.250 --> 00:00:49.260 
want 18 inches no it's like 18 to 20

00:00:49.260 --> 00:00:52.130 
want 18 inches no it's like 18 to 20
meaning<00:00:49.739> that<00:00:49.950> it<00:00:50.399> appears<00:00:51.149> 18<00:00:51.719> inches<00:00:52.079> I

00:00:52.130 --> 00:00:52.140 
meaning that it appears 18 inches I

00:00:52.140 --> 00:00:54.200 
meaning that it appears 18 inches I
guess<00:00:52.500> and<00:00:52.800> when<00:00:52.920> it's<00:00:53.070> straight<00:00:53.489> in<00:00:53.520> those<00:00:53.820> 20

00:00:54.200 --> 00:00:54.210 
guess and when it's straight in those 20

00:00:54.210 --> 00:00:57.500 
guess and when it's straight in those 20
inches<00:00:54.629> I<00:00:55.020> guess<00:00:56.010> that's<00:00:56.219> how<00:00:56.280> they<00:00:56.579> measure

00:00:57.500 --> 00:00:57.510 
inches I guess that's how they measure

00:00:57.510 --> 00:01:02.150 
inches I guess that's how they measure
their<00:00:57.809> hair<00:00:58.020> but<00:00:58.289> yeah<00:00:59.250> so<00:00:59.730> far<00:01:00.149> I<00:01:00.719> just<00:01:01.530> can't
