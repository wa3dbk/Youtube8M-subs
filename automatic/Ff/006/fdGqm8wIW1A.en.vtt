for all those guys that they do and they
definitely<00:00:28.840> have<00:00:29.290> the<00:00:29.380> mountain<00:00:29.770> like<00:00:29.890> this

00:00:29.909 --> 00:00:29.919 
definitely have the mountain like this

00:00:29.919 --> 00:00:32.400 
definitely have the mountain like this
guy<00:00:30.250> covered<00:00:30.700> sure<00:00:31.450> most<00:00:31.750> batteries<00:00:32.230> will

00:00:32.400 --> 00:00:32.410 
guy covered sure most batteries will

00:00:32.410 --> 00:00:33.930 
guy covered sure most batteries will
live<00:00:32.590> right<00:00:32.800> where<00:00:32.980> they<00:00:33.070> always<00:00:33.250> decided

00:00:33.930 --> 00:00:33.940 
live right where they always decided

00:00:33.940 --> 00:00:36.060 
live right where they always decided
they<00:00:34.030> should<00:00:34.059> then<00:00:34.809> again<00:00:35.170> there's<00:00:35.739> a<00:00:35.829> whole

00:00:36.060 --> 00:00:36.070 
they should then again there's a whole
