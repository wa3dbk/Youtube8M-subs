00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.330
 for the manufacture of volumetric background in 

00:00:02.850 --> 00:00:11.330
 I took the usual aquarium foam 

00:00:05.330 --> 00:00:14.639
 25 density me the result is not particularly 

00:00:11.330 --> 00:00:17.029
 liked it is not very good all because 

00:00:14.639 --> 00:00:21.630
 which is too all the same soft foam and 

00:00:17.029 --> 00:00:25.430
 it crumbles very much 

00:00:21.630 --> 00:00:28.619
 painted with cement slurry 

00:00:25.430 --> 00:00:31.410
 one to one with sand and using 

00:00:28.619 --> 00:00:32.600
 special dye for making 

00:00:31.410 --> 00:00:35.930
 paving slabs 

00:00:32.600 --> 00:00:38.850
 iron oxide or iron acid 

00:00:35.930 --> 00:00:41.090
 Special dyes I think they can 

00:00:38.850 --> 00:00:44.570
 find in any city 

00:00:41.090 --> 00:00:49.730
 workshops for the production of paving slabs 

00:00:44.570 --> 00:00:53.329
 for example the bag was then it turns out that 

00:00:49.730 --> 00:00:56.370
 the foam is very soft and I jump 

00:00:53.329 --> 00:00:58.440
 take your hands here even if you put it 

00:00:56.370 --> 00:01:00.710
 in the aquarium then she is all this 

00:00:58.440 --> 00:01:03.530
 cracked naturally cling 

00:01:00.710 --> 00:01:04.860
 I 'll take the eye in but we don't need it 

00:01:03.530 --> 00:01:08.130
 of course 

00:01:04.860 --> 00:01:11.850
 so I decided to take 

00:01:08.130 --> 00:01:13.740
 used to make the background very 

00:01:11.850 --> 00:01:17.509
 high density foam 

00:01:13.740 --> 00:01:22.700
 tattoo is usually used for warming 

00:01:17.509 --> 00:01:22.700
 floors or facades 

00:01:23.420 --> 00:01:32.200
 here is this kinooglaz 5 centimeters thick 

00:01:28.540 --> 00:01:44.479
 from frisky width 

00:01:32.200 --> 00:01:48.070
 my aquarium work this blanket but 

00:01:44.479 --> 00:01:51.500
 much can be said 

00:01:48.070 --> 00:01:53.920
 easier better than foam but because 

00:01:51.500 --> 00:01:57.830
 much less trash 

00:01:53.920 --> 00:02:00.950
 these balls that you flew 

00:01:57.830 --> 00:02:03.560
 were around everywhere not just not 

00:02:00.950 --> 00:02:11.410
 stuck to the last time I was tortured then 

00:02:03.560 --> 00:02:11.410
 collect material of course 

00:02:12.940 --> 00:02:22.190
 partially obtained relief itself in general I 

00:02:18.980 --> 00:02:34.180
 I am trying to repeat the relief that can 

00:02:22.190 --> 00:02:34.180
 observe just the slope of the other rocks 

00:02:34.480 --> 00:02:40.690
 amazing on hardly be able to pass on 

00:02:39.470 --> 00:02:43.580
 at least somehow 

00:02:40.690 --> 00:02:46.490
 come closer maybe 

00:02:43.580 --> 00:02:53.860
 the kind that can be observed by 

00:02:46.490 --> 00:02:53.860
 way to surprise you and Katyusha 

00:02:53.870 --> 00:03:04.659
 climbs out onto the road in some 

00:02:58.489 --> 00:03:04.659
 places even hang very much from all over 

00:03:06.610 --> 00:03:27.190
 centimeter by centimeter there is already everything 

00:03:27.280 --> 00:03:34.390
 Fanta and the fact that roughly what you 

00:03:31.760 --> 00:03:34.390
 want to achieve 

00:03:47.810 --> 00:04:04.080
 posts actually go parallel 

00:03:53.880 --> 00:04:06.390
 almost exactly a layer of wind and rain 

00:04:04.080 --> 00:04:08.989
 so it is almost invisible by 

00:04:06.390 --> 00:04:18.859
 the next one may hang over 

00:04:08.989 --> 00:04:18.859
 bottom with a knife g. 

00:04:19.160 --> 00:04:27.860
 last denser than usual with stars rivai 

00:04:42.080 --> 00:04:57.290
 for all this it should be painted over 

00:04:45.000 --> 00:04:57.290
 pretty good, I hope so. 

00:04:59.780 --> 00:05:05.900
 the picture is quietly manifested 

00:05:07.879 --> 00:05:12.530
 it seems to me that there is enough 

00:05:12.680 --> 00:05:22.440
 realistic spouse we don't like 

00:05:18.629 --> 00:05:25.800
 I ask it like a stone return 

00:05:22.440 --> 00:05:31.500
 similar to cropped turnout time 

00:05:25.800 --> 00:05:34.130
 foam can her imagination not 

00:05:31.500 --> 00:05:34.130
 may suffer 

00:05:40.789 --> 00:05:50.690
 interestingly nude after more than three 

00:05:46.020 --> 00:05:50.690
 o'clock that's what I did 

00:05:55.009 --> 00:06:03.499
 To be honest, I wanted everything for today . 

00:05:57.229 --> 00:06:05.449
 and throw because already tired so well 

00:06:03.499 --> 00:06:07.729
 as the only day off next 

00:06:05.449 --> 00:06:13.869
 you could not transfer the output 

00:06:07.729 --> 00:06:13.869
 do now we will paint this whole thing 

00:06:20.169 --> 00:06:29.180
 used dye at least 

00:06:25.119 --> 00:06:32.389
 spread this whole thing with liquid one to 

00:06:29.180 --> 00:06:37.039
 one solution checks one to one with 

00:06:32.389 --> 00:06:44.539
 cement mark 500 and painted it all 

00:06:37.039 --> 00:06:49.370
 two layers all dried up because of these 

00:06:44.539 --> 00:06:51.709
 screeds had to cut the scenery 

00:06:49.370 --> 00:06:57.369
 in half and and cut diagonally as it were 

00:06:51.709 --> 00:07:00.430
 along here these layers of nude shevchik 

00:06:57.369 --> 00:07:04.399
 if you look closely visible as a whole 

00:07:00.430 --> 00:07:05.599
 I think noticeably will not be in my width 

00:07:04.399 --> 00:07:09.349
 got close 

00:07:05.599 --> 00:07:11.959
 under screeds and even had to under cut 

00:07:09.349 --> 00:07:15.319
 a little bit least silicone on the back 

00:07:11.959 --> 00:07:17.180
 wall principle everything keeps up 

00:07:15.319 --> 00:07:21.099
 there are no slots 

00:07:17.180 --> 00:07:21.099
 there is some kind of fish swam
