is married entering a marriage and an

00:00:59.440 --> 00:01:01.950 
is married entering a marriage and an
unhealthy<00:00:59.890> way<00:01:00.280> I<00:01:00.550> would<00:01:01.090> discourage<00:01:01.449> it<00:01:01.750> but

00:01:01.950 --> 00:01:01.960 
unhealthy way I would discourage it but

00:01:01.960 --> 00:01:04.020 
unhealthy way I would discourage it but
there<00:01:02.649> are<00:01:02.739> a<00:01:02.769> lot<00:01:02.920> of<00:01:02.949> healthy<00:01:03.519> ways<00:01:03.699> to<00:01:03.940> do

00:01:04.020 --> 00:01:04.030 
there are a lot of healthy ways to do

00:01:04.030 --> 00:01:05.219 
there are a lot of healthy ways to do
marriage<00:01:04.269> as<00:01:04.390> well<00:01:04.509> but<00:01:04.720> it<00:01:04.780> requires<00:01:05.080> a<00:01:05.140> high

00:01:05.219 --> 00:01:05.229 
marriage as well but it requires a high

00:01:05.229 --> 00:01:07.410 
marriage as well but it requires a high
level<00:01:05.440> of<00:01:05.710> maturity<00:01:06.190> there<00:01:06.759> needs<00:01:06.970> to<00:01:07.090> be<00:01:07.210> open

00:01:07.410 --> 00:01:07.420 
level of maturity there needs to be open

00:01:07.420 --> 00:01:09.450 
level of maturity there needs to be open

only<00:01:25.119> reason<00:01:25.360> I<00:01:25.420> got<00:01:25.450> married<00:01:25.840> was<00:01:25.990> because

00:01:26.190 --> 00:01:26.200 
only reason I got married was because

00:01:26.200 --> 00:01:29.450 
only reason I got married was because
gay<00:01:26.350> marriage<00:01:26.560> is<00:01:26.650> illegal<00:01:26.799> right<00:01:27.189> so<00:01:27.880> the

00:01:29.450 --> 00:01:29.460 
gay marriage is illegal right so the

00:01:29.460 --> 00:01:33.260 
gay marriage is illegal right so the

00:01:33.260 --> 00:01:33.270 
obviously that's not the case but but I

00:01:33.270 --> 00:01:38.249 
obviously that's not the case but but I
through<00:01:34.270> part<00:01:34.540> of<00:01:34.630> my<00:01:34.840> journey<00:01:35.409> I<00:01:36.900> started<00:01:37.900> to

00:01:38.249 --> 00:01:38.259 
through part of my journey I started to

00:01:38.259 --> 00:01:43.560 
through part of my journey I started to
feel<00:01:40.259> when<00:01:41.259> I<00:01:41.290> first<00:01:41.820> after<00:01:42.820> kind<00:01:43.000> of<00:01:43.060> a<00:01:43.149> faith

00:01:43.560 --> 00:01:43.570 
feel when I first after kind of a faith

00:01:43.570 --> 00:01:45.030 
feel when I first after kind of a faith
crisis<00:01:44.049> around<00:01:44.320> coming<00:01:44.649> to<00:01:44.710> terms<00:01:44.860> of

00:01:45.030 --> 00:01:45.040 
crisis around coming to terms of

00:01:45.040 --> 00:01:46.350 
crisis around coming to terms of
sexuality<00:01:45.310> I<00:01:45.610> didn't<00:01:45.880> believe<00:01:46.030> I<00:01:46.119> would<00:01:46.240> ever

00:01:46.350 --> 00:01:46.360 
sexuality I didn't believe I would ever

00:01:46.360 --> 00:01:49.039 
sexuality I didn't believe I would ever
get<00:01:46.509> married<00:01:46.659> and<00:01:47.049> then<00:01:47.710> there<00:01:47.890> came<00:01:48.040> a<00:01:48.100> time

00:01:49.039 --> 00:01:49.049 
get married and then there came a time

00:01:49.049 --> 00:01:51.810 
get married and then there came a time
where<00:01:50.049> I<00:01:50.079> started<00:01:50.590> to<00:01:50.649> feel<00:01:50.890> like<00:01:50.950> I<00:01:51.280> would<00:01:51.670> get

00:01:51.810 --> 00:01:51.820 
where I started to feel like I would get

00:01:51.820 --> 00:01:53.789 
where I started to feel like I would get
married<00:01:52.210> but<00:01:52.810> it<00:01:52.930> would<00:01:53.020> be<00:01:53.110> like<00:01:53.350> way<00:01:53.530> far<00:01:53.770> off

00:01:53.789 --> 00:01:53.799 
married but it would be like way far off

00:01:53.799 --> 00:01:56.310 
married but it would be like way far off
and<00:01:54.280> then<00:01:54.909> you<00:01:55.240> know<00:01:55.270> certainly<00:01:55.840> later<00:01:56.110> rather

00:01:56.310 --> 00:01:56.320 
and then you know certainly later rather

00:01:56.320 --> 00:01:57.749 
and then you know certainly later rather
than<00:01:56.469> sooner<00:01:56.590> and<00:01:57.040> then<00:01:57.189> that<00:01:57.340> started<00:01:57.670> to

00:01:57.749 --> 00:01:57.759 
than sooner and then that started to

00:01:57.759 --> 00:01:58.980 
than sooner and then that started to
shift<00:01:57.969> and<00:01:58.180> I<00:01:58.240> felt<00:01:58.420> like<00:01:58.479> maybe<00:01:58.659> I'll<00:01:58.840> get

00:01:58.980 --> 00:01:58.990 
shift and I felt like maybe I'll get

00:01:58.990 --> 00:02:00.380 
shift and I felt like maybe I'll get
married<00:01:59.110> sooner<00:01:59.469> rather<00:01:59.560> than<00:01:59.740> later<00:01:59.860> and

00:02:00.380 --> 00:02:00.390 
married sooner rather than later and

00:02:00.390 --> 00:02:05.999 
married sooner rather than later and
when<00:02:01.390> I<00:02:01.420> finally<00:02:02.850> when<00:02:03.850> I<00:02:03.880> met<00:02:04.180> my<00:02:04.360> wife<00:02:04.390> it<00:02:05.290> was

00:02:05.999 --> 00:02:06.009 
when I finally when I met my wife it was

we've never ever had any difficulties in

00:03:20.599 --> 00:03:22.509 
we've never ever had any difficulties in
our<00:03:20.689> sexual<00:03:20.959> relationship<00:03:21.049> and<00:03:21.829> and<00:03:22.040> just<00:03:22.370> the

00:03:22.509 --> 00:03:22.519 
our sexual relationship and and just the

00:03:22.519 --> 00:03:23.920 
our sexual relationship and and just the
love<00:03:22.729> that<00:03:22.939> I<00:03:23.000> feel<00:03:23.180> in<00:03:23.329> the<00:03:23.389> relation<00:03:23.689> in<00:03:23.840> our

00:03:23.920 --> 00:03:23.930 
love that I feel in the relation in our

00:03:23.930 --> 00:03:25.960 
love that I feel in the relation in our
relationship<00:03:24.439> has<00:03:25.009> brought<00:03:25.459> a<00:03:25.489> lot<00:03:25.639> of<00:03:25.699> joy

00:03:25.960 --> 00:03:25.970 
relationship has brought a lot of joy

00:03:25.970 --> 00:03:31.559 
relationship has brought a lot of joy
and<00:03:26.239> so<00:03:26.840> I<00:03:26.870> think<00:03:27.169> marriage<00:03:27.709> is<00:03:28.299> it's<00:03:29.299> not<00:03:29.889> how

00:03:31.559 --> 00:03:31.569 
and so I think marriage is it's not how

00:03:31.569 --> 00:03:36.550 
and so I think marriage is it's not how
there's<00:03:32.569> I<00:03:32.900> think<00:03:33.470> it's<00:03:33.859> a<00:03:33.919> mistake<00:03:34.400> to<00:03:35.560> to

00:03:36.550 --> 00:03:36.560 
there's I think it's a mistake to to

00:03:36.560 --> 00:03:39.089 
there's I think it's a mistake to to
choose<00:03:36.979> marriage<00:03:37.669> or<00:03:38.000> to<00:03:38.030> choose<00:03:38.599> marriage

00:03:39.089 --> 00:03:39.099 
choose marriage or to choose marriage

00:03:39.099 --> 00:03:43.210 
choose marriage or to choose marriage
specifically<00:03:40.099> around<00:03:41.349> what<00:03:42.349> or<00:03:42.560> how<00:03:42.709> much<00:03:42.979> I'm

00:03:43.210 --> 00:03:43.220 
specifically around what or how much I'm

00:03:43.220 --> 00:03:45.280 
specifically around what or how much I'm
feeling<00:03:43.669> with<00:03:43.879> regard<00:03:44.209> to<00:03:44.299> sexuality<00:03:44.750> at<00:03:45.139> any

00:03:45.280 --> 00:03:45.290 
feeling with regard to sexuality at any

00:03:45.290 --> 00:03:47.140 
feeling with regard to sexuality at any
given<00:03:45.470> point<00:03:45.709> a<00:03:46.040> lot<00:03:46.220> of<00:03:46.340> marriages<00:03:46.819> a<00:03:46.879> lot<00:03:47.060> of

00:03:47.140 --> 00:03:47.150 
given point a lot of marriages a lot of

00:03:47.150 --> 00:03:48.429 
given point a lot of marriages a lot of
heterosexual<00:03:47.659> marriages<00:03:47.989> have<00:03:48.139> ended

00:03:48.429 --> 00:03:48.439 
heterosexual marriages have ended

00:03:48.439 --> 00:03:50.469 
heterosexual marriages have ended
because<00:03:48.590> they<00:03:48.889> started<00:03:49.310> based<00:03:50.000> purely<00:03:50.299> on

00:03:50.469 --> 00:03:50.479 
because they started based purely on

00:03:50.479 --> 00:03:52.839 
because they started based purely on
sexuality<00:03:51.220> it's<00:03:52.220> not<00:03:52.400> a<00:03:52.430> healthy<00:03:52.729> foundation

00:03:52.839 --> 00:03:52.849 
sexuality it's not a healthy foundation

00:03:52.849 --> 00:03:55.719 
sexuality it's not a healthy foundation
it's<00:03:53.419> not<00:03:53.509> a<00:03:53.540> strong<00:03:53.810> foundation<00:03:54.379> and<00:03:54.560> so<00:03:55.370> but

00:03:55.719 --> 00:03:55.729 
it's not a strong foundation and so but

00:03:55.729 --> 00:03:57.909 
it's not a strong foundation and so but
certainly<00:03:56.359> if<00:03:56.720> someone<00:03:57.139> develops<00:03:57.470> a<00:03:57.560> really

00:03:57.909 --> 00:03:57.919 
certainly if someone develops a really

00:03:57.919 --> 00:03:59.259 
certainly if someone develops a really
strong<00:03:58.159> love<00:03:58.430> and<00:03:58.639> intimacy<00:03:58.790> and<00:03:59.060> connection
