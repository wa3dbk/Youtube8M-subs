00:00:22.250 --> 00:00:22.260 
its finances but i think it's just

00:00:22.260 --> 00:00:24.320 
its finances but i think it's just
something<00:00:22.619> to<00:00:22.740> do<00:00:22.859> with<00:00:22.980> the<00:00:23.100> packaging<00:00:23.670> the

00:03:30.880 --> 00:03:30.890 
where I split my hair and then I go here

00:03:30.890 --> 00:03:35.259 
where I split my hair and then I go here
and<00:03:31.989> do<00:03:32.989> this<00:03:33.170> side<00:03:33.470> and<00:03:33.890> then<00:03:34.090> through<00:03:35.090> here

00:03:35.259 --> 00:03:35.269 
and do this side and then through here

00:03:35.269 --> 00:03:37.509 
and do this side and then through here
so<00:03:35.540> every<00:03:35.989> like<00:03:36.260> one<00:03:36.560> or<00:03:36.709> two<00:03:36.739> inches<00:03:37.310> i<00:03:37.459> do

so every like one or two inches i do

00:03:37.519 --> 00:03:40.210 
so every like one or two inches i do
that<00:03:37.880> and<00:03:38.180> then<00:03:38.570> it<00:03:38.720> stopped<00:03:39.170> to<00:03:39.560> a<00:03:39.590> round<00:03:39.890> here

00:03:40.210 --> 00:03:40.220 
that and then it stopped to a round here

00:03:40.220 --> 00:03:43.000 
that and then it stopped to a round here
on<00:03:40.250> both<00:03:40.730> sides<00:03:41.150> just<00:03:41.540> because<00:03:41.930> the<00:03:42.560> bottom

00:03:43.000 --> 00:03:43.010 
on both sides just because the bottom

00:03:43.010 --> 00:03:46.030 
on both sides just because the bottom
part<00:03:43.610> of<00:03:43.910> my<00:03:44.180> scalp<00:03:44.870> and<00:03:45.230> hair<00:03:45.440> doesn't<00:03:45.890> really

00:03:46.030 --> 00:03:46.040 
part of my scalp and hair doesn't really

00:03:46.040 --> 00:03:48.430 
part of my scalp and hair doesn't really
get<00:03:46.250> oily<00:03:46.760> and<00:03:46.910> it<00:03:47.030> doesn't<00:03:47.299> show<00:03:47.630> either<00:03:48.019> so

00:03:48.430 --> 00:03:48.440 
get oily and it doesn't show either so

00:03:48.440 --> 00:03:52.120 
get oily and it doesn't show either so
it's<00:03:48.890> not<00:03:49.040> really<00:03:49.430> important<00:03:49.970> to<00:03:50.860> take<00:03:51.860> away

00:03:52.120 --> 00:03:52.130 
it's not really important to take away

00:03:52.130 --> 00:03:56.530 
it's not really important to take away
the<00:03:52.340> oil<00:03:52.720> from<00:03:53.720> that<00:03:54.019> part<00:03:54.610> and<00:03:55.610> then<00:03:55.820> after

00:03:56.530 --> 00:03:56.540 
the oil from that part and then after

00:03:56.540 --> 00:03:59.050 
the oil from that part and then after
that<00:03:56.570> I<00:03:56.750> go<00:03:56.989> to<00:03:57.019> my<00:03:57.200> crown<00:03:57.620> and<00:03:58.040> I<00:03:58.190> do<00:03:58.790> a<00:03:58.850> little

00:04:01.810 --> 00:04:01.820 
split here and then I do i do two

00:04:01.820 --> 00:04:04.210 
split here and then I do i do two
sections<00:04:02.360> on<00:04:02.600> my<00:04:02.780> crown<00:04:03.049> area<00:04:03.380> because<00:04:04.070> that
