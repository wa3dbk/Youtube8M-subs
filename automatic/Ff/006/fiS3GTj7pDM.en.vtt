00:00:10.040 --> 00:00:16.200
 It's the first time I put a 

00:00:13.559 --> 00:00:16.919
 wooden board under the chest to 

00:00:16.200 --> 00:00:18.720
 rhyme 

00:00:16.919 --> 00:00:22.410
 I was amazed at the wooden plank 

00:00:18.720 --> 00:00:25.710
 Lightweight tough can not be true 

00:00:22.410 --> 00:00:26.930
 I started to search a little more boring 

00:00:25.710 --> 00:00:30.090
 news and how they really 

00:00:26.930 --> 00:00:32.460
 we made a press we got the 

00:00:30.090 --> 00:00:35.670
 woods and then came the first board 

00:00:32.460 --> 00:00:38.660
 it has been a success for 12 years that the fund 

00:00:35.670 --> 00:00:38.660
 just fill in the legal 

00:00:50.380 --> 00:00:53.380
 now 

00:00:54.970 --> 00:00:59.890
 to gift in such cases 

00:01:05.760 --> 00:01:09.850
 8 

00:01:08.430 --> 00:01:12.729
 yesterday 

00:01:09.850 --> 00:01:15.280
 but it is a pain and a lot of 

00:01:12.729 --> 00:01:17.979
 increasingly education they have 

00:01:15.280 --> 00:01:20.290
 commented the quality performance in 

00:01:17.979 --> 00:01:22.810
 beginning we had no room was all 

00:01:20.290 --> 00:01:25.390
 made by hand today we already have a 

00:01:22.810 --> 00:01:27.520
 a little more technology to learn 

00:01:25.390 --> 00:01:30.460
 a little more the production process is 

00:01:27.520 --> 00:01:31.860
 more complicated but she has some 

00:01:30.460 --> 00:01:34.780
 as well as being environmentally 

00:01:31.860 --> 00:01:37.210
 correct and the hv it is not so malleable 

00:01:34.780 --> 00:01:39.700
 as the polyurethane foam then 

00:01:37.210 --> 00:01:41.440
 You have to take care of several 

00:01:39.700 --> 00:01:43.899
 denominations have to take care of 

00:01:41.440 --> 00:01:47.490
 with the lines with the fibers but the 

00:01:43.899 --> 00:01:47.490
 result is a spectacle 

00:01:50.260 --> 00:01:57.930
 the great differential this against culture 

00:01:53.230 --> 00:01:57.930
 to rescue the origins of the south 

00:01:59.250 --> 00:02:05.440
 changes the perspective of the person in 

00:02:02.200 --> 00:02:07.180
 relationship to arise is a sport you think 

00:02:05.440 --> 00:02:09.850
 but when you analyze use 

00:02:07.180 --> 00:02:13.510
 equipment and see that he is aggressive to 

00:02:09.850 --> 00:02:16.300
 philosophy of surfing ends up competing with 

00:02:13.510 --> 00:02:18.940
 the current production of planks to use 

00:02:16.300 --> 00:02:21.640
 extremely toxic and harmful materials 

00:02:18.940 --> 00:02:24.870
 to nature then this project precisely 

00:02:21.640 --> 00:02:28.480
 against all this consumerist culture 

00:02:24.870 --> 00:02:32.760
 At the price that will last the most you have one 

00:02:28.480 --> 00:02:32.760
 other link with the equipment 

00:02:33.970 --> 00:02:39.130
 that a surfer he likes this business 

00:02:36.730 --> 00:02:41.590
 to protect nature or anything else 

00:02:39.130 --> 00:02:43.330
 that reduces waste 

00:02:41.590 --> 00:02:47.190
 singing each time a way 

00:02:43.330 --> 00:02:50.020
 sustainable people enjoy the beach 

00:02:47.190 --> 00:02:51.850
 of different surf of course is the work is 

00:02:50.020 --> 00:02:54.000
 one thing to have fun together but in 

00:02:51.850 --> 00:02:54.000
 essence 

00:02:55.420 --> 00:03:02.030
 It's a board that made people 

00:02:58.460 --> 00:03:04.130
 think otherwise 

00:03:02.030 --> 00:03:07.190
 It's really fun being able to make a champion. 

00:03:04.130 --> 00:03:11.630
 different feeling of the south with a board 

00:03:07.190 --> 00:03:13.910
 of agave is only who uses one in the water that 

00:03:11.630 --> 00:03:16.910
 yes, some angels already 

00:03:13.910 --> 00:03:19.750
 They have experienced up to the 

00:03:16.910 --> 00:03:19.750
 little bug 

00:03:25.560 --> 00:03:28.560
 ae
