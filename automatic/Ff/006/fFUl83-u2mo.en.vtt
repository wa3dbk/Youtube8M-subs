this hack once the hacks been run you
can<00:01:34.200> go<00:01:34.320> back<00:01:34.500> and<00:01:34.560> you<00:01:35.100> know<00:01:35.189> start

00:01:35.450 --> 00:01:35.460 
can go back and you know start

00:01:35.460 --> 00:01:36.800 
can go back and you know start
programming<00:01:36.060> and<00:01:36.180> start<00:01:36.360> loading<00:01:36.570> things

00:01:36.800 --> 00:01:36.810 
programming and start loading things

00:01:36.810 --> 00:01:39.020 
programming and start loading things
into<00:01:37.170> cross-media<00:01:37.619> bar<00:01:37.979> least<00:01:38.670> that's<00:01:38.939> the

into cross-media bar least that's the

00:01:39.030 --> 00:01:40.370 
into cross-media bar least that's the
theory<00:01:39.329> right<00:01:39.630> now

00:01:40.370 --> 00:01:40.380 
theory right now

00:01:40.380 --> 00:01:43.860 
theory right now
even<00:01:41.380> at<00:01:41.500> the<00:01:41.940> the<00:01:42.940> other<00:01:43.030> operating<00:01:43.510> system

even at the the other operating system

00:01:43.870 --> 00:01:46.230 
even at the the other operating system
level<00:01:43.990> all<00:01:44.710> the<00:01:44.770> cords<00:01:45.370> are<00:01:45.460> unlock<00:01:45.760> now<00:01:46.000> with

00:01:46.230 --> 00:01:46.240 
level all the cords are unlock now with

00:01:46.240 --> 00:01:50.250 
level all the cords are unlock now with
this<00:01:46.390> so<00:01:47.110> you<00:01:47.200> can<00:01:47.350> really<00:01:47.740> start<00:01:48.040> to<00:01:48.160> play<00:01:49.260> so

00:01:50.250 --> 00:01:50.260 
this so you can really start to play so

00:01:50.260 --> 00:01:55.080 
this so you can really start to play so
