hey guys today by tutorial for you on
how<00:00:02.790> to<00:00:03.090> create<00:00:03.360> a<00:00:03.510> virus<00:00:04.310> of<00:00:05.310> sorts<00:00:05.790> that<00:00:06.060> will

00:00:06.260 --> 00:00:06.270 
how to create a virus of sorts that will

00:00:06.270 --> 00:00:09.250 
how to create a virus of sorts that will
not<00:00:06.960> allow<00:00:07.230> the<00:00:07.290> user<00:00:07.830> to<00:00:07.980> move<00:00:08.400> their<00:00:08.700> mouse

00:00:13.700 --> 00:00:13.710 
going to open up a visual studio and

00:00:13.710 --> 00:00:16.220 
going to open up a visual studio and
we're<00:00:14.670> going<00:00:14.849> to<00:00:14.910> create<00:00:15.120> a<00:00:15.210> new<00:00:15.420> project<00:00:15.690> and

00:00:16.220 --> 00:00:16.230 
we're going to create a new project and

00:00:16.230 --> 00:00:23.450 
we're going to create a new project and
I'm<00:00:16.920> just<00:00:16.949> going<00:00:17.369> to<00:00:17.640> name<00:00:17.789> it<00:00:18.140> virus<00:00:22.310> use<00:00:23.310> this

00:00:23.450 --> 00:00:23.460 
I'm just going to name it virus use this

going to just drag a timer out here and
I<00:00:34.739> put<00:00:35.010> a<00:00:35.070> timer<00:00:35.340> on<00:00:35.520> our<00:00:35.670> form<00:00:35.910> and<00:00:36.230> this<00:00:37.230> is

00:00:37.280 --> 00:00:37.290 
I put a timer on our form and this is

00:00:37.290 --> 00:00:40.010 
I put a timer on our form and this is
basically<00:00:37.920> all<00:00:38.070> we're<00:00:38.370> going<00:00:38.489> to<00:00:38.550> need<00:00:39.020> so

00:00:40.010 --> 00:00:40.020 
basically all we're going to need so

00:00:40.020 --> 00:00:44.600 
basically all we're going to need so
what<00:00:40.649> we<00:00:40.770> can<00:00:40.920> do<00:00:41.160> here<00:00:41.700> is<00:00:42.500> I<00:00:43.500> can<00:00:43.559> actually<00:00:44.250> go

00:00:44.600 --> 00:00:44.610 
what we can do here is I can actually go

00:00:44.610 --> 00:00:47.420 
what we can do here is I can actually go
over<00:00:44.640> here<00:00:45.270> click<00:00:45.559> on<00:00:46.559> a<00:00:46.590> form<00:00:46.890> go<00:00:47.190> to<00:00:47.250> our

00:00:47.420 --> 00:00:47.430 
over here click on a form go to our

00:00:47.430 --> 00:00:51.260 
over here click on a form go to our
properties<00:00:47.879> scroll<00:00:48.539> down<00:00:49.309> to<00:00:50.309> we<00:00:50.460> see<00:00:50.670> opacity

00:00:51.260 --> 00:00:51.270 
properties scroll down to we see opacity

00:00:51.270 --> 00:00:54.350 
properties scroll down to we see opacity
and<00:00:51.510> change<00:00:51.750> it<00:00:51.899> to<00:00:51.930> 1%<00:00:53.030> then<00:00:54.030> we're<00:00:54.180> going<00:00:54.329> to

00:00:54.350 --> 00:00:54.360 
and change it to 1% then we're going to

00:00:54.360 --> 00:00:57.950 
and change it to 1% then we're going to
double<00:00:54.539> click<00:00:54.809> on<00:00:54.989> our<00:00:55.110> timer<00:00:55.410> and<00:00:56.570> above<00:00:57.570> here

00:00:57.950 --> 00:00:57.960 
double click on our timer and above here

00:00:57.960 --> 00:01:01.330 
double click on our timer and above here
in<00:00:58.109> no<00:00:58.739> brackets<00:00:59.219> run<00:00:59.969> a<00:01:00.000> type<00:01:00.300> of<00:01:00.329> point<00:01:00.899> and

00:01:01.330 --> 00:01:01.340 
in no brackets run a type of point and

00:01:01.340 --> 00:01:05.929 
in no brackets run a type of point and
then<00:01:02.340> D<00:01:02.809> position<00:01:03.809> and<00:01:04.339> this<00:01:05.339> is<00:01:05.519> going<00:01:05.729> to<00:01:05.790> be

00:01:05.929 --> 00:01:05.939 
then D position and this is going to be

00:01:05.939 --> 00:01:08.600 
then D position and this is going to be
our<00:01:06.299> 0<00:01:06.780> 0<00:01:07.229> so<00:01:07.680> the<00:01:07.890> mouse<00:01:08.070> is<00:01:08.310> going<00:01:08.400> to<00:01:08.490> be

00:01:08.600 --> 00:01:08.610 
our 0 0 so the mouse is going to be

00:01:08.610 --> 00:01:11.750 
our 0 0 so the mouse is going to be
stuck<00:01:09.390> up<00:01:09.630> here<00:01:10.010> you<00:01:11.010> can<00:01:11.159> change<00:01:11.340> this<00:01:11.549> later

00:01:11.750 --> 00:01:11.760 
stuck up here you can change this later

00:01:11.760 --> 00:01:13.270 
stuck up here you can change this later
I'm<00:01:12.000> going<00:01:12.119> to<00:01:12.180> show<00:01:12.360> you<00:01:12.390> how

00:01:13.270 --> 00:01:13.280 
I'm going to show you how

00:01:13.280 --> 00:01:17.420 
I'm going to show you how
but<00:01:14.280> now<00:01:14.430> on<00:01:14.670> our<00:01:14.790> timer<00:01:15.000> one<00:01:15.299> tick<00:01:16.250> first<00:01:17.250> we

00:01:17.420 --> 00:01:17.430 
but now on our timer one tick first we

00:01:17.430 --> 00:01:19.700 
but now on our timer one tick first we
go<00:01:17.670> up<00:01:17.759> here<00:01:18.060> under<00:01:18.630> initialize<00:01:19.140> component

00:01:19.700 --> 00:01:19.710 
go up here under initialize component

00:01:19.710 --> 00:01:22.399 
go up here under initialize component
we're<00:01:19.890> going<00:01:20.009> to<00:01:20.130> do<00:01:20.220> timer<00:01:20.490> 1<00:01:20.880> dot<00:01:21.360> dot<00:01:21.600> start

00:01:22.399 --> 00:01:22.409 
we're going to do timer 1 dot dot start

00:01:22.409 --> 00:01:25.840 
we're going to do timer 1 dot dot start
and<00:01:22.939> then<00:01:23.939> right<00:01:24.509> in<00:01:24.659> the<00:01:24.750> left<00:01:24.930> parenthesis

00:01:25.840 --> 00:01:25.850 
and then right in the left parenthesis

00:01:25.850 --> 00:01:29.660 
and then right in the left parenthesis
so<00:01:26.850> now<00:01:26.970> we're<00:01:27.150> going<00:01:27.450> to<00:01:27.650> set<00:01:28.650> our<00:01:28.950> point

00:01:29.660 --> 00:01:29.670 
so now we're going to set our point

00:01:29.670 --> 00:01:35.090 
so now we're going to set our point
so<00:01:29.909> D<00:01:30.210> position<00:01:31.079> x<00:01:31.799> equals<00:01:32.729> 0<00:01:33.360> and<00:01:33.770> also<00:01:34.770> D

00:01:35.090 --> 00:01:35.100 
so D position x equals 0 and also D

00:01:35.100 --> 00:01:39.649 
so D position x equals 0 and also D
position<00:01:35.729> y<00:01:36.329> equals<00:01:37.079> 0<00:01:38.150> and<00:01:39.150> what<00:01:39.299> this<00:01:39.479> is

00:01:39.649 --> 00:01:39.659 
position y equals 0 and what this is

00:01:39.659 --> 00:01:40.819 
position y equals 0 and what this is
going<00:01:39.840> to<00:01:39.900> do<00:01:40.049> is<00:01:40.140> going<00:01:40.320> to<00:01:40.409> tell<00:01:40.590> it<00:01:40.710> the

00:01:40.819 --> 00:01:40.829 
going to do is going to tell it the

00:01:40.829 --> 00:01:42.679 
going to do is going to tell it the
position<00:01:41.040> is<00:01:41.549> way<00:01:41.759> up<00:01:41.909> here<00:01:42.119> in<00:01:42.240> the<00:01:42.270> left-hand

00:01:42.679 --> 00:01:42.689 
position is way up here in the left-hand

00:01:42.689 --> 00:01:46.010 
position is way up here in the left-hand
corner<00:01:43.170> of<00:01:43.200> the<00:01:43.320> screen<00:01:43.560> that<00:01:43.890> is<00:01:44.040> 0<00:01:44.280> 0<00:01:44.899> so<00:01:45.899> now

00:01:46.010 --> 00:01:46.020 
corner of the screen that is 0 0 so now

00:01:46.020 --> 00:01:48.639 
corner of the screen that is 0 0 so now
we're<00:01:46.140> going<00:01:46.320> to<00:01:46.530> type<00:01:46.710> cursor<00:01:47.100> dot<00:01:47.880> position

00:01:48.639 --> 00:01:48.649 
we're going to type cursor dot position

00:01:48.649 --> 00:01:53.139 
we're going to type cursor dot position
equals<00:01:49.649> D<00:01:50.399> position<00:01:51.060> now<00:01:52.020> this<00:01:52.200> will<00:01:52.380> tell<00:01:52.560> to

00:01:53.139 --> 00:01:53.149 
equals D position now this will tell to

00:01:53.149 --> 00:01:56.660 
equals D position now this will tell to
make<00:01:54.149> the<00:01:54.360> cursor<00:01:54.750> the<00:01:55.079> mouse<00:01:55.290> go<00:01:56.280> up<00:01:56.430> here

00:01:56.660 --> 00:01:56.670 
make the cursor the mouse go up here

00:01:56.670 --> 00:01:58.850 
make the cursor the mouse go up here
into<00:01:56.820> the<00:01:57.000> left-hand<00:01:57.390> corner<00:01:57.750> so<00:01:58.710> now<00:01:58.829> I

00:01:58.850 --> 00:01:58.860 
into the left-hand corner so now I

00:01:58.860 --> 00:02:02.060 
into the left-hand corner so now I
should<00:01:59.130> be<00:01:59.159> able<00:01:59.250> debug<00:01:59.790> this<00:02:00.000> and<00:02:00.829> you<00:02:01.829> can't

00:02:02.060 --> 00:02:02.070 
should be able debug this and you can't

00:02:02.070 --> 00:02:03.950 
should be able debug this and you can't
see<00:02:02.219> the<00:02:02.340> form<00:02:02.610> and<00:02:02.790> sure<00:02:03.000> enough<00:02:03.030> my<00:02:03.450> mouse<00:02:03.689> is

00:02:03.950 --> 00:02:03.960 
see the form and sure enough my mouse is

00:02:03.960 --> 00:02:06.800 
see the form and sure enough my mouse is
stuck<00:02:04.290> up<00:02:04.500> in<00:02:04.619> the<00:02:04.740> left-hand<00:02:05.009> corner<00:02:05.700> so<00:02:06.630> the

00:02:06.800 --> 00:02:06.810 
stuck up in the left-hand corner so the

00:02:06.810 --> 00:02:08.719 
stuck up in the left-hand corner so the
only<00:02:06.930> way<00:02:07.229> we<00:02:07.409> can<00:02:07.530> stop<00:02:07.770> this<00:02:07.829> really<00:02:08.310> is<00:02:08.459> to

00:02:08.719 --> 00:02:08.729 
only way we can stop this really is to

00:02:08.729 --> 00:02:13.760 
only way we can stop this really is to
press<00:02:08.970> Alt<00:02:09.360> +<00:02:09.780> f4<00:02:10.110> and<00:02:10.819> that<00:02:11.819> will<00:02:11.970> close<00:02:12.150> it<00:02:12.709> so

00:02:13.760 --> 00:02:13.770 
press Alt + f4 and that will close it so

00:02:13.770 --> 00:02:15.590 
press Alt + f4 and that will close it so
now<00:02:13.890> if<00:02:13.950> you<00:02:14.100> want<00:02:14.250> to<00:02:14.340> change<00:02:14.580> it<00:02:14.790> let's<00:02:15.180> say

00:02:15.590 --> 00:02:15.600 
now if you want to change it let's say

00:02:15.600 --> 00:02:22.790 
now if you want to change it let's say
we<00:02:15.960> go<00:02:16.940> 500<00:02:17.940> and<00:02:18.470> 300<00:02:19.470> and<00:02:20.810> read<00:02:21.810> the<00:02:21.930> bug<00:02:22.140> are

00:02:22.790 --> 00:02:22.800 
we go 500 and 300 and read the bug are

00:02:22.800 --> 00:02:26.000 
we go 500 and 300 and read the bug are
now<00:02:22.950> stuck<00:02:23.430> in<00:02:23.460> the<00:02:23.640> center<00:02:23.910> of<00:02:24.000> the<00:02:24.180> screen<00:02:25.010> so

00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:26.010 
now stuck in the center of the screen so

00:02:26.010 --> 00:02:28.790 
now stuck in the center of the screen so
something<00:02:26.400> you<00:02:26.430> can<00:02:26.670> do<00:02:26.790> is<00:02:27.000> change<00:02:27.870> the<00:02:28.290> time

00:02:28.790 --> 00:02:28.800 
something you can do is change the time

00:02:28.800 --> 00:02:33.070 
something you can do is change the time
or<00:02:29.430> the<00:02:30.150> interval<00:02:30.600> of<00:02:31.470> the<00:02:31.770> time<00:02:31.980> work<00:02:32.250> to<00:02:32.610> one

00:02:33.070 --> 00:02:33.080 
or the interval of the time work to one

00:02:33.080 --> 00:02:37.310 
or the interval of the time work to one
might<00:02:34.080> slow<00:02:34.350> your<00:02:34.500> program<00:02:34.890> down<00:02:36.140> but<00:02:37.140> it's

00:02:37.310 --> 00:02:37.320 
might slow your program down but it's

00:02:37.320 --> 00:02:40.700 
might slow your program down but it's
going<00:02:37.470> to<00:02:37.530> make<00:02:37.620> it<00:02:37.890> stuck<00:02:38.490> a<00:02:38.700> lot<00:02:39.200> more<00:02:40.200> than

00:02:40.700 --> 00:02:40.710 
going to make it stuck a lot more than

00:02:40.710 --> 00:02:43.790 
going to make it stuck a lot more than
it<00:02:41.460> would<00:02:41.670> be<00:02:41.700> if<00:02:41.910> raise<00:02:42.120> out<00:02:42.270> 100<00:02:42.710> so<00:02:43.710> now

00:02:43.790 --> 00:02:43.800 
it would be if raise out 100 so now

00:02:43.800 --> 00:02:45.500 
it would be if raise out 100 so now
basically<00:02:44.040> your<00:02:44.430> mouse<00:02:44.580> is<00:02:44.820> stuck<00:02:45.240> there

00:02:45.500 --> 00:02:45.510 
basically your mouse is stuck there

00:02:45.510 --> 00:02:49.520 
basically your mouse is stuck there
unless<00:02:45.930> you<00:02:46.110> press<00:02:46.320> alt<00:02:46.650> f4<00:02:47.100> and<00:02:48.140> you<00:02:49.140> can<00:02:49.320> even

00:02:49.520 --> 00:02:49.530 
unless you press alt f4 and you can even

00:02:49.530 --> 00:02:54.590 
unless you press alt f4 and you can even
have<00:02:49.860> another<00:02:50.430> timer<00:02:50.820> here<00:02:52.610> we<00:02:53.610> can<00:02:53.760> put

00:02:54.590 --> 00:02:54.600 
have another timer here we can put

00:02:54.600 --> 00:02:57.380 
have another timer here we can put
another<00:02:54.690> time<00:02:55.050> around<00:02:55.200> a4<00:02:55.560> and<00:02:55.970> we<00:02:56.970> can<00:02:57.150> change

00:02:57.380 --> 00:02:57.390 
another time around a4 and we can change

00:02:57.390 --> 00:03:01.340 
another time around a4 and we can change
this<00:02:57.630> to<00:02:57.690> maybe<00:02:59.600> 10,000<00:03:00.600> cells<00:03:00.810> give<00:03:01.020> me<00:03:01.140> 10

00:03:01.340 --> 00:03:01.350 
this to maybe 10,000 cells give me 10

00:03:01.350 --> 00:03:04.100 
this to maybe 10,000 cells give me 10
seconds<00:03:01.770> we<00:03:01.860> can<00:03:01.890> set<00:03:02.220> enable<00:03:02.640> to<00:03:02.970> true<00:03:03.270> you

00:03:04.100 --> 00:03:04.110 
seconds we can set enable to true you

00:03:04.110 --> 00:03:08.720 
seconds we can set enable to true you
can<00:03:04.260> go<00:03:04.890> over<00:03:05.010> here<00:03:05.360> when<00:03:06.360> our<00:03:06.590> timer<00:03:07.590> 1<00:03:07.860> start

00:03:08.720 --> 00:03:08.730 
can go over here when our timer 1 start

00:03:08.730 --> 00:03:16.730 
can go over here when our timer 1 start
you<00:03:08.850> can<00:03:09.030> timer<00:03:09.690> to<00:03:12.140> dot<00:03:13.140> start<00:03:14.450> and<00:03:15.450> we<00:03:16.260> can<00:03:16.440> go

00:03:16.730 --> 00:03:16.740 
you can timer to dot start and we can go

00:03:16.740 --> 00:03:20.150 
you can timer to dot start and we can go
back<00:03:16.950> and<00:03:17.160> double<00:03:17.700> click<00:03:17.850> on<00:03:17.940> our<00:03:18.000> timer<00:03:18.300> 2<00:03:18.540> &amp;<00:03:19.130> 1
