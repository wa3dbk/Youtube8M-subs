00:00:01.399 --> 00:00:04.399
 Kitas are guiltless 

00:00:08.829 --> 00:00:11.589
 Dear friends CeBeeF was 

00:00:11.589 --> 00:00:14.780
 I am happy about them today via the social network Facebook 

00:00:19.409 --> 00:00:22.449
 SAP got to know Chris Lowe GGK 

00:00:23.400 --> 00:00:24.999
 Grab the bag 

00:00:24.999 --> 00:00:27.169
 it counts alone 

00:00:27.169 --> 00:00:29.449
 I was immediately excited 

00:00:29.449 --> 00:00:31.109
 perfectly fine 

00:00:31.109 --> 00:00:33.820
 but on the other holder too 

00:00:33.820 --> 00:00:36.340
 That's why I am today 

00:00:36.340 --> 00:00:39.340
 The most important thing in life is that you are authentic 

00:00:41.140 --> 00:00:43.880
 Image reuters / 

00:00:43.880 --> 00:00:45.880
 I'm not yet that age 

00:00:45.880 --> 00:00:48.070
 or I do not feel so far yet 

00:00:48.070 --> 00:00:49.940
 strangely 

00:00:49.940 --> 00:00:51.310
 Mr. tie 

00:00:51.310 --> 00:00:53.880
 tells us to present 

00:00:53.880 --> 00:00:56.880
 I had to change shortly afterwards 

00:00:57.870 --> 00:01:00.870
 to what I suggest the next day 

00:01:01.940 --> 00:01:06.230
 after I log on our website Chuck 

00:01:06.230 --> 00:01:06.980
 Berry 

00:01:06.980 --> 00:01:10.450
 good atmosphere popular support Merkels for laughs 

00:01:11.200 --> 00:01:14.400
 Which is of course a room 

00:01:14.400 --> 00:01:15.360
 to 4 

00:01:15.360 --> 00:01:16.530
 for us 

00:01:16.530 --> 00:01:21.210
 a rare event though a viewer to Homefront will be as 1000 

00:01:23.360 --> 00:01:25.160
 actually very euphoric mood 

00:01:25.160 --> 00:01:28.410
 and I would wish for that 

00:01:28.410 --> 00:01:31.410
 this audience in this atmosphere 

00:01:33.040 --> 00:01:34.880
 I know that's hard 

00:01:34.880 --> 00:01:36.150
 but 

00:01:36.150 --> 00:01:38.260
 It's well worth it for us 

00:01:38.260 --> 00:01:40.430
 to fight alongside Larsen spectators 

00:01:40.430 --> 00:01:43.430
 the spectators have to support this young team 

00:01:44.700 --> 00:01:47.290
 We are also a bit far from the euphoria 

00:01:47.290 --> 00:01:50.470
 which is transmitted by the ranks and the games 

00:01:50.470 --> 00:01:52.230
 among others from Bayer 

00:01:52.230 --> 00:01:55.250
 I hope that we too 

00:01:55.250 --> 00:01:56.460
 active 

00:01:56.460 --> 00:01:58.160
 numerous supported 

00:01:58.160 --> 00:02:00.420
 Book in advance Hegemann 

00:02:00.420 --> 00:02:04.200
 often even asked what makes this team and why we on ca 

00:02:05.090 --> 00:02:07.180
 I have to say that honestly 

00:02:07.180 --> 00:02:08.619
 I already have it 

00:02:08.619 --> 00:02:12.249
 I do not think I've had more than two decades in professional football 

00:02:13.459 --> 00:02:16.739
 this is our house together 

00:02:16.739 --> 00:02:19.739
 So who characterizes so passion 

00:02:21.359 --> 00:02:25.189
 rarely do you train for or rarely a part of a German team 

00:02:25.819 --> 00:02:28.289
 his had i think that makes us 

00:02:28.289 --> 00:02:29.309
 Rattner 

00:02:29.309 --> 00:02:32.259
 young players who are still developing 

00:02:32.259 --> 00:02:33.539
 combined with 

00:02:33.539 --> 00:02:36.539
 experienced players 

00:02:37.389 --> 00:02:40.649
 works with us try to give structure 

00:02:41.729 --> 00:02:43.149
 this combination 

00:02:43.149 --> 00:02:44.939
 she turns us off 

00:02:44.939 --> 00:02:48.169
 Of course it is still sometimes with killer Barthel 

00:02:48.169 --> 00:02:49.259
 Strahlemann 

00:02:49.259 --> 00:02:50.549
 they ran 

00:02:50.549 --> 00:02:52.849
 what chances the goals 

00:02:52.849 --> 00:02:54.549
 so have let lie 

00:02:54.549 --> 00:02:56.989
 but Peter ESA 

00:02:56.989 --> 00:02:59.089
 every day of this team 

00:02:59.089 --> 00:03:02.069
 is worth it because it just makes us happy to betray fun 

00:03:02.069 --> 00:03:05.069
 to go to her limits what keeps him going deep 

00:03:09.079 --> 00:03:11.019
 more precisely 

00:03:11.019 --> 00:03:12.379
 Situation brought 

00:03:12.379 --> 00:03:13.889
 this is allowed 

00:03:13.889 --> 00:03:15.029
 if you still leave 

00:03:15.029 --> 00:03:18.419
 Start believing that 

00:03:18.419 --> 00:03:19.999
 also in Bochum is normal 

00:03:19.999 --> 00:03:22.069
 there is an agreement from us 

00:03:22.069 --> 00:03:23.899
 but always modest 

00:03:23.899 --> 00:03:26.899
 we believe 

00:03:29.929 --> 00:03:32.399
 the weakness at a court festival 

00:03:32.399 --> 00:03:35.399
 I like it and I hope you like it too 

00:03:36.189 --> 00:03:37.239
 Weather 

00:03:37.239 --> 00:03:39.329
 so right at the beginning 

00:03:39.329 --> 00:03:41.219
 Pelletier I want to shiver once more
