troubles I've been watching a lot of

00:00:43.140 --> 00:00:46.160 
troubles I've been watching a lot of
videos<00:00:43.710> and<00:00:44.399> that's<00:00:44.760> pretty<00:00:45.059> common<00:00:45.329> is<00:00:45.719> to

00:00:46.160 --> 00:00:46.170 
videos and that's pretty common is to

00:00:46.170 --> 00:00:49.340 
videos and that's pretty common is to
have<00:00:46.320> that<00:00:46.530> pain<00:00:46.829> and<00:00:47.629> feelings<00:00:48.629> particularly

00:00:49.340 --> 00:00:49.350

00:00:49.350 --> 00:00:51.049 
have that pain and feelings particularly
when<00:00:49.469> you're<00:00:49.559> just<00:00:49.770> going<00:00:49.920> to<00:00:49.980> fill<00:00:50.219> and<00:00:50.550> you
