00:05:06.570 --> 00:05:06.580 
look at it for long enough that it'll go

00:05:06.580 --> 00:05:11.460 
look at it for long enough that it'll go
because<00:05:07.060> it<00:05:07.180> works<00:05:07.360> really<00:05:07.480> well<00:05:10.050> okay<00:05:11.050> so<00:05:11.110> it

00:05:11.460 --> 00:05:11.470 
because it works really well okay so it

00:05:11.470 --> 00:05:14.610 
because it works really well okay so it
wasn't<00:05:11.680> an<00:05:11.860> actual<00:05:12.070> highscore<00:05:12.550> list<00:05:13.530> you<00:05:14.530> can

00:05:14.610 --> 00:05:14.620 
wasn't an actual highscore list you can

00:05:14.620 --> 00:05:17.310 
wasn't an actual highscore list you can
see<00:05:14.800> them<00:05:14.890> on<00:05:14.980> the<00:05:15.070> bottom<00:05:15.370> there<00:05:16.290> like<00:05:17.290> I

00:05:17.310 --> 00:05:17.320 
see them on the bottom there like I

00:05:17.320 --> 00:05:19.110 
see them on the bottom there like I
really<00:05:17.860> doubt<00:05:17.980> this<00:05:18.040> is<00:05:18.250> synced<00:05:18.820> with<00:05:18.880> the

00:05:19.110 --> 00:05:19.120 
really doubt this is synced with the

00:05:19.120 --> 00:05:21.270 
really doubt this is synced with the
internet<00:05:19.420> but<00:05:19.740> I'm<00:05:20.740> trying<00:05:20.950> to<00:05:21.040> look<00:05:21.100> around

00:05:21.270 --> 00:05:21.280 
internet but I'm trying to look around

00:05:21.280 --> 00:05:22.440 
internet but I'm trying to look around
for<00:05:21.400> a<00:05:21.550> sec<00:05:21.730> here<00:05:21.880> now<00:05:22.000> that<00:05:22.120> it's<00:05:22.240> nighttime

00:06:01.710 --> 00:06:01.720 
safe to say that this is would

00:06:01.720 --> 00:06:02.670
