before you put it on your nail is make

00:02:35.700 --> 00:02:37.670 
before you put it on your nail is make
it<00:02:35.850> a<00:02:35.940> little<00:02:36.150> bit<00:02:36.330> less<00:02:36.540> sticky<00:02:36.870> I<00:02:37.170> stick<00:02:37.560> it

00:02:37.670 --> 00:02:37.680 
it a little bit less sticky I stick it

00:02:37.680 --> 00:02:40.310 
it a little bit less sticky I stick it
on<00:02:37.769> my<00:02:37.890> hand<00:02:38.280> like<00:02:38.580> a<00:02:39.120> million<00:02:39.600> times<00:02:39.870> until

00:02:40.310 --> 00:02:40.320 
on my hand like a million times until

00:02:40.320 --> 00:02:43.430 
on my hand like a million times until
it's<00:02:40.920> not<00:02:41.640> as<00:02:41.910> super<00:02:42.420> sticky<00:02:42.810> as<00:02:43.049> it

00:02:43.430 --> 00:02:43.440 
it's not as super sticky as it

00:02:43.440 --> 00:02:45.470 
it's not as super sticky as it
originally<00:02:44.040> is<00:02:44.190> because<00:02:44.670> it's<00:02:45.120> just<00:02:45.330> easier

00:02:45.470 --> 00:02:45.480 
originally is because it's just easier

00:02:45.480 --> 00:02:49.160 
originally is because it's just easier
to<00:02:45.810> work<00:02:45.959> with<00:02:46.019> that<00:02:46.200> way<00:02:47.420> Here<00:02:48.420> I<00:02:48.450> am<00:02:48.570> trying

00:02:49.160 --> 00:02:49.170 
to work with that way Here I am trying

00:02:49.170 --> 00:02:53.449 
to work with that way Here I am trying
to<00:02:49.410> demonstrate<00:02:49.620> the<00:02:51.230> stickiness<00:02:52.230> it<00:02:53.220> has

00:02:53.449 --> 00:02:53.459 
to demonstrate the stickiness it has

00:02:53.459 --> 00:02:55.789 
to demonstrate the stickiness it has
become<00:02:53.940> less<00:02:54.420> sticky<00:02:54.780> if<00:02:55.110> you<00:02:55.350> can't<00:02:55.590> tell

00:02:55.789 --> 00:02:55.799 
become less sticky if you can't tell

00:02:55.799 --> 00:02:58.370 
become less sticky if you can't tell
I've<00:02:56.519> done<00:02:56.760> that<00:02:56.910> to<00:02:57.120> both<00:02:57.450> pieces<00:02:57.810> of<00:02:58.140> tape

00:02:58.370 --> 00:02:58.380 
I've done that to both pieces of tape

00:02:58.380 --> 00:03:00.320 
I've done that to both pieces of tape
and<00:02:58.650> I'm<00:02:59.040> setting<00:02:59.310> one<00:02:59.549> of<00:02:59.670> them<00:02:59.820> to<00:02:59.970> the<00:03:00.060> side

00:03:00.320 --> 00:03:00.330 
and I'm setting one of them to the side

00:03:00.330 --> 00:03:02.570 
and I'm setting one of them to the side
and<00:03:00.630> I'm<00:03:01.170> putting<00:03:01.350> one<00:03:01.620> of<00:03:01.769> them<00:03:01.920> onto<00:03:02.130> my<00:03:02.340> nail

00:03:02.570 --> 00:03:02.580 
and I'm putting one of them onto my nail

00:03:02.580 --> 00:03:04.580 
and I'm putting one of them onto my nail
and<00:03:02.850> I<00:03:03.090> just<00:03:03.299> do<00:03:03.390> it<00:03:03.510> kind<00:03:03.780> of<00:03:03.870> in<00:03:04.019> a<00:03:04.110> diagonal

00:03:04.580 --> 00:03:04.590 
and I just do it kind of in a diagonal

00:03:04.590 --> 00:03:06.770 
and I just do it kind of in a diagonal
and<00:03:05.010> I<00:03:05.130> do<00:03:05.190> the<00:03:05.400> other<00:03:05.430> one<00:03:05.820> the<00:03:06.000> same<00:03:06.030> way<00:03:06.510> and

00:03:06.770 --> 00:03:06.780 
and I do the other one the same way and

00:03:06.780 --> 00:03:09.890 
and I do the other one the same way and
I<00:03:06.900> form<00:03:07.290> kind<00:03:07.709> of<00:03:07.830> a<00:03:08.040> V<00:03:08.340> it's<00:03:08.880> really<00:03:09.299> up<00:03:09.450> to<00:03:09.480> you

00:03:12.810 --> 00:03:15.319 
what the V looks like I kind of do it
however<00:03:13.200> it<00:03:13.650> turns<00:03:13.920> out<00:03:14.220> but<00:03:14.760> the<00:03:14.850> main<00:03:15.060> thing

00:03:15.319 --> 00:03:15.329 
however it turns out but the main thing

00:03:15.329 --> 00:03:17.150 
however it turns out but the main thing
is<00:03:15.450> you<00:03:15.600> want<00:03:15.750> to<00:03:15.780> make<00:03:15.930> sure<00:03:15.989> it's<00:03:16.470> pressed
