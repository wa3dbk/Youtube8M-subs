00:00:00.719 --> 00:00:06.420
 but the mass of yourself a slave and you are not nauseous 

00:00:03.840 --> 00:00:10.020
 give out 

00:00:06.420 --> 00:00:12.330
 how to translate with assassin's creed 

00:00:10.020 --> 00:00:16.110
 of childhood here fantasized of course 

00:00:12.330 --> 00:00:18.750
 shorter sometime ago Arabs were 

00:00:16.110 --> 00:00:19.470
 enlightened people there developed 

00:00:18.750 --> 00:00:21.689
 science 

00:00:19.470 --> 00:00:24.300
 Well, for example, we use exactly 

00:00:21.689 --> 00:00:24.930
 Arabic numerals which, unlike 

00:00:24.300 --> 00:00:27.359
 roman 

00:00:24.930 --> 00:00:30.930
 allow you to perform calculations with 

00:00:27.359 --> 00:00:34.920
 infinitely large numbers but then on 

00:00:30.930 --> 00:00:37.590
 east islam brain and 

00:00:34.920 --> 00:00:40.050
 they all turned into those savages with 

00:00:37.590 --> 00:00:42.839
 barbaric customs that 

00:00:40.050 --> 00:00:45.720
 most of it remains now 

00:00:42.839 --> 00:00:48.059
 a lot of this contributed to the fact that 

00:00:45.720 --> 00:00:50.570
 Islam at one time split into two 

00:00:48.059 --> 00:00:52.799
 rival political factions 

00:00:50.570 --> 00:00:54.199
 conservative sunnis and more 

00:00:52.799 --> 00:00:57.239
 tolerant shia 

00:00:54.199 --> 00:00:59.879
 since any ossified by religion 

00:00:57.239 --> 00:01:03.119
 society prefers orthodoxy 

00:00:59.879 --> 00:01:05.159
 Shiites were generally in the minority 

00:01:03.119 --> 00:01:07.890
 had to hide and live in the underground 

00:01:05.159 --> 00:01:09.240
 to fight they had their own 

00:01:07.890 --> 00:01:11.609
 kind of partisan 

00:01:09.240 --> 00:01:12.719
 the very assassins who are usually 

00:01:11.609 --> 00:01:15.359
 covertly 

00:01:12.719 --> 00:01:18.270
 but no less methodically they killed their 

00:01:15.359 --> 00:01:21.149
 opponents about the origin of the word assassin 

00:01:18.270 --> 00:01:23.250
 you read it yourself but in a general sense it is 

00:01:21.149 --> 00:01:26.009
 the word means assassin 

00:01:23.250 --> 00:01:28.799
 killer if in our word in Russian 

00:01:26.009 --> 00:01:31.350
 creed has a religious connotation and 

00:01:28.799 --> 00:01:32.850
 denotes a set of rules to which 

00:01:31.350 --> 00:01:35.509
 followers of this or that 

00:01:32.850 --> 00:01:39.179
 religious teachings should follow 

00:01:35.509 --> 00:01:42.270
 I remind you that with aspen were religious 

00:01:39.179 --> 00:01:44.609
 Islamic fanatics therefore apparently 

00:01:42.270 --> 00:01:47.640
 the developers and chosen precisely this word 

00:01:44.609 --> 00:01:49.109
 in the game the main postulate of this set 

00:01:47.640 --> 00:01:52.380
 rules is 

00:01:49.109 --> 00:01:53.429
 do not kill and love your neighbor as 

00:01:52.380 --> 00:01:56.130
 and befits 

00:01:53.429 --> 00:01:58.969
 the true religion of the world which is 

00:01:56.130 --> 00:02:03.179
 Islam I think you all saw on the news 

00:01:58.969 --> 00:02:06.929
 how passionately love each other and those around 

00:02:03.179 --> 00:02:08.580
 Of course, the faithful sons of Allah see the main ones 

00:02:06.929 --> 00:02:11.730
 The postulate of the assassins in the game is 

00:02:08.580 --> 00:02:14.280
 for example steel and wind permitted what 

00:02:11.730 --> 00:02:18.030
 translates as nothing is true all 

00:02:14.280 --> 00:02:20.580
 well, about like guests from 

00:02:18.030 --> 00:02:21.840
 ears and behave the capital and other 

00:02:20.580 --> 00:02:24.420
 Russian cities 

00:02:21.840 --> 00:02:27.330
 based on this, there are three more 

00:02:24.420 --> 00:02:30.569
 rules of p blade of life of the funds 

00:02:27.330 --> 00:02:33.000
 innocent do not stick the fruit of the innocent 

00:02:30.569 --> 00:02:34.470
 Apparently the guests of our country are all polls 

00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:37.380
 hiding a pen in your pocket 

00:02:34.470 --> 00:02:37.800
 for this reason aid in plain 

00:02:37.380 --> 00:02:40.920
 sight 

00:02:37.800 --> 00:02:43.680
 be invisible staying in plain sight 

00:02:40.920 --> 00:02:46.200
 hence the love for tinted prior 

00:02:43.680 --> 00:02:48.750
 compromise hawks 

00:02:46.200 --> 00:02:52.590
 never let fraternity be 

00:02:48.750 --> 00:02:53.910
 compromised so any cue 

00:02:52.590 --> 00:02:57.600
 starts with the word 

00:02:53.910 --> 00:03:00.080
 Once the rulebook in Russian is usually 

00:02:57.600 --> 00:03:03.030
 called code but code assassins 

00:03:00.080 --> 00:03:05.100
 does not bear religious colors 

00:03:03.030 --> 00:03:07.670
 but the words of the creed just has 

00:03:05.100 --> 00:03:10.860
 historical significance of religiosity 

00:03:07.670 --> 00:03:13.580
 therefore assassin creed most 

00:03:10.860 --> 00:03:13.580
 adequate translation
