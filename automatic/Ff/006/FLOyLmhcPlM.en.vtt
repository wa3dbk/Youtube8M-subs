you can't really tell in the video but

00:03:16.820 --> 00:03:19.720 
you can't really tell in the video but
it<00:03:17.330> is<00:03:17.540> and<00:03:17.989> air<00:03:18.320> gets<00:03:18.560> in<00:03:18.709> and<00:03:19.100> so<00:03:19.340> I<00:03:19.370> wouldn't

00:03:19.720 --> 00:03:19.730 
it is and air gets in and so I wouldn't

00:05:50.169 --> 00:05:51.480 
the bottoms cute and parts of it are
cute<00:05:50.470> but<00:05:50.710> there's<00:05:50.889> just<00:05:51.039> something<00:05:51.220> that

00:05:51.480 --> 00:05:51.490 
cute but there's just something that

00:05:51.490 --> 00:05:53.070 
cute but there's just something that
like<00:05:51.639> I<00:05:51.789> think<00:05:51.909> it's<00:05:52.120> too<00:05:52.300> loose<00:05:52.479> if<00:05:52.810> it<00:05:52.960> was

00:05:53.070 --> 00:05:53.080 
like I think it's too loose if it was

00:05:53.080 --> 00:05:55.920 
like I think it's too loose if it was
tight<00:05:53.349> around<00:05:53.620> the<00:05:53.889> arms<00:05:53.919> I<00:05:54.639> think<00:05:55.330> it<00:05:55.810> would

00:05:55.920 --> 00:05:55.930 
tight around the arms I think it would

00:05:55.930 --> 00:05:57.899 
tight around the arms I think it would
be<00:05:56.110> a<00:05:56.139> very<00:05:56.409> cute<00:05:56.740> dress<00:05:57.069> and<00:05:57.370> I'm<00:05:57.520> having<00:05:57.729> to

00:05:57.909 --> 00:06:00.059 
be a very cute dress and I'm having to
wear<00:05:57.970> this<00:05:58.120> belt<00:05:58.330> around<00:05:58.539> it<00:05:58.870> because<00:05:59.800> it

00:06:00.059 --> 00:06:00.069 
wear this belt around it because it

00:06:00.069 --> 00:06:01.770 
wear this belt around it because it
looks<00:06:00.280> really<00:06:00.639> even<00:06:00.969> more<00:06:01.150> awkward<00:06:01.300> without
