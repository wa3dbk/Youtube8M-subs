00:00:40.079 --> 00:00:44.020
 hello everyone I was was comment those of the 

00:00:42.910 --> 00:00:45.820
 dgt guides 

00:00:44.020 --> 00:00:47.410
 Estevez with a light weight already seen in 

00:00:45.820 --> 00:00:49.000
 the previous installment of the saga although it 

00:00:47.410 --> 00:00:50.410
 was about another model and that is one of 

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:51.550
 the big surprises within this 

00:00:50.410 --> 00:00:56.579
 blackout 2 

00:00:51.550 --> 00:00:56.579
 we are talking about the m 48 let's start 

00:00:57.150 --> 00:01:01.560
 that of mica 48 is 1 meter lightly 

00:00:59.400 --> 00:01:03.360
 Belgian and American made since 2003 

00:01:01.560 --> 00:01:06.150
 by efe in the same company as the fall 

00:01:03.360 --> 00:01:08.070
 or the p 90 for example keeps certain 

00:01:06.150 --> 00:01:09.720
 similar to the m 249 both in 

00:01:08.070 --> 00:01:11.580
 appearance as in features already 

00:01:09.720 --> 00:01:13.950
 that of her cinema being a version 

00:01:11.580 --> 00:01:16.440
 improved to m 40 and 60 already seen in 

00:01:13.950 --> 00:01:19.140
 modern warfare 3 is used by the sun 

00:01:16.440 --> 00:01:22.790
 as Americans especially we go with the 

00:01:19.140 --> 00:01:22.790
 m 48 black ops 2 

00:01:23.570 --> 00:01:27.260
 m 48 is the first light input of the 

00:01:25.940 --> 00:01:29.030
 game without counting the classes 

00:01:27.260 --> 00:01:31.370
 predetermined available from 

00:01:29.030 --> 00:01:33.100
 level 4 is fully automatic 

00:01:31.370 --> 00:01:35.660
 shooting a non negligible figure 

00:01:33.100 --> 00:01:37.400
 625 blocks per minute so the 

00:01:35.660 --> 00:01:39.380
 cadence is somewhat low considering 

00:01:37.400 --> 00:01:41.210
 that I only meter lightly however 

00:01:39.380 --> 00:01:43.460
 thanks to this your backwardness will be very 

00:01:41.210 --> 00:01:44.720
 controllable the bad thing about this white b2 is 

00:01:43.460 --> 00:01:46.430
 that the light version does not 

00:01:44.720 --> 00:01:48.200
 has neither accessories nor advantages 

00:01:46.430 --> 00:01:49.729
 accelerate the recharge so 

00:01:48.200 --> 00:01:52.009
 We will be forced to suffer a while 

00:01:49.729 --> 00:01:55.060
 of recharge of almost 8 seconds is already the 

00:01:52.009 --> 00:01:57.040
 Charger half or empty 

00:01:55.060 --> 00:01:58.630
 your bathroom is the highest inside the 

00:01:57.040 --> 00:02:00.939
 category killing three shots at 

00:01:58.630 --> 00:02:02.710
 body from close to medium distances and from 

00:02:00.939 --> 00:02:04.689
 far the environment is somewhat more open 

00:02:02.710 --> 00:02:06.640
 we will use four shots even though these 

00:02:04.689 --> 00:02:10.200
 distances exceed 55 meters 

00:02:06.640 --> 00:02:12.030
 situations that will not be very common 

00:02:10.200 --> 00:02:13.980
 its potential reach is also the most 

00:02:12.030 --> 00:02:15.959
 high between the light metras so 

00:02:13.980 --> 00:02:17.849
 this coupled with its great damage to the weapon 

00:02:15.959 --> 00:02:19.140
 an authentic machine to kill your 

00:02:17.849 --> 00:02:20.940
 multiplier damage to the head is for 

00:02:19.140 --> 00:02:22.830
 1,2 so added the above 

00:02:20.940 --> 00:02:25.110
 said now that we kill enemies with a 

00:02:22.830 --> 00:02:27.569
 incredible ease of two or three bullets 

00:02:25.110 --> 00:02:29.400
 combining a low rate with a damage 

00:02:27.569 --> 00:02:31.080
 and bestial reach and its highest 

00:02:29.400 --> 00:02:32.910
 precision we manage to get some 

00:02:31.080 --> 00:02:35.430
 times in killing almost instantaneous but 

00:02:32.910 --> 00:02:37.290
 as is the recoil the shots of the 

00:02:35.430 --> 00:02:38.790
 america 48 follow a pretty pattern 

00:02:37.290 --> 00:02:40.530
 irregular but thanks to its accuracy 

00:02:38.790 --> 00:02:42.690
 even at long distances our 

00:02:40.530 --> 00:02:44.130
 shots were incredibly accurate their 

00:02:42.690 --> 00:02:45.780
 look at the best we found 

00:02:44.130 --> 00:02:47.370
 defect in the game reminding us of the 

00:02:45.780 --> 00:02:49.230
 look at the m 41 of the modern saga 

00:02:47.370 --> 00:02:51.840
 warfare and serving us both short 

00:02:49.230 --> 00:02:53.519
 as long distances with all these 

00:02:51.840 --> 00:02:55.890
 data let's see the best combination of 

00:02:53.519 --> 00:02:58.400
 advantages accessories and competitions for 

00:02:55.890 --> 00:02:58.400
 this weapon 

00:02:58.830 --> 00:03:02.700
 within the category of accessories 

00:03:00.420 --> 00:03:04.080
 we recommend practically all of them since 

00:03:02.700 --> 00:03:07.590
 they adapt in a spectacular way to the 

00:03:04.080 --> 00:03:08.820
 mica 48 but we highlight 6 a look like 

00:03:07.590 --> 00:03:10.710
 I said earlier it is not 

00:03:08.820 --> 00:03:11.820
 really necessary but for those 

00:03:10.710 --> 00:03:13.620
 that do not like the iron sight 

00:03:11.820 --> 00:03:16.110
 some mines like that of or roof or 

00:03:13.620 --> 00:03:19.819
 seeker of targets will be very useful and 

00:03:16.110 --> 00:03:21.319
 attentive and even the hybrid looks 

00:03:19.819 --> 00:03:22.879
 The variety zoom sights are the 

00:03:21.319 --> 00:03:25.099
 accessories to stand out for weird that you 

00:03:22.879 --> 00:03:27.019
 look for short distances is not very 

00:03:25.099 --> 00:03:28.969
 useful but for long socks is the best 

00:03:27.019 --> 00:03:30.799
 that there is also allows us to increase 

00:03:28.969 --> 00:03:32.810
 with two different points in the targeted 

00:03:30.799 --> 00:03:34.129
 which will help to gain accuracy since 

00:03:32.810 --> 00:03:36.049
 the center of this sight is in 

00:03:34.129 --> 00:03:37.909
 a red dot may seem to you 

00:03:36.049 --> 00:03:39.739
 strange but of the three best accesses 

00:03:37.909 --> 00:03:40.840
 of the m-40 done under our point of 

00:03:39.739 --> 00:03:43.239
 view 

00:03:40.840 --> 00:03:45.670
 the stock is not a vital accessory but 

00:03:43.239 --> 00:03:46.870
 yes it helps to be able to move while 

00:03:45.670 --> 00:03:48.760
 we are aiming it is as if not 

00:03:46.870 --> 00:03:50.019
 we were getting look is something that 

00:03:48.760 --> 00:03:51.819
 will improve our ability to avoid 

00:03:50.019 --> 00:03:53.379
 shots and move through the mapping if the 

00:03:51.819 --> 00:03:54.730
 consequences and cons of the low 

00:03:53.379 --> 00:03:56.349
 speed of movement that we will have 

00:03:54.730 --> 00:03:58.720
 while we carry this cow in our 

00:03:56.349 --> 00:04:01.060
 arms as we said is not vital for 

00:03:58.720 --> 00:04:02.860
 kill easily with the m 48 but 

00:04:01.060 --> 00:04:04.680
 combined with other accessories and that 

00:04:02.860 --> 00:04:06.659
 it was useful 

00:04:04.680 --> 00:04:08.459
 he draws fast he leans a lot 

00:04:06.659 --> 00:04:09.780
 more necessary in this weapon the 

00:04:08.459 --> 00:04:11.549
 lightweight has a time has 

00:04:09.780 --> 00:04:12.900
 aimed very high so the four 

00:04:11.549 --> 00:04:14.640
 lines of the reticle that indicates 

00:04:12.900 --> 00:04:16.650
 by its proximity how accurate it will be 

00:04:14.640 --> 00:04:18.299
 the shot will take longer to come together and 

00:04:16.650 --> 00:04:20.459
 therefore less accurate will be the shot 

00:04:18.299 --> 00:04:22.139
 with this accessory we will solve something 

00:04:20.459 --> 00:04:23.669
 this deficiency and if we put it together with the 

00:04:22.139 --> 00:04:25.320
 look at laser that makes this separation 

00:04:23.669 --> 00:04:27.270
 of the four lines is smaller by 

00:04:25.320 --> 00:04:29.180
 defect will have to be pointed and never more 

00:04:27.270 --> 00:04:31.220
 again be a problem 

00:04:29.180 --> 00:04:32.750
 finally the silencer is a way 

00:04:31.220 --> 00:04:34.729
 smart to take advantage of the weapon 

00:04:32.750 --> 00:04:36.229
 if the m-40 in fact has a huge 

00:04:34.729 --> 00:04:38.000
 reach a high damage put a 

00:04:36.229 --> 00:04:39.770
 silencer will practically not affect you 

00:04:38.000 --> 00:04:41.270
 no chance and will help us maintain 

00:04:39.770 --> 00:04:43.039
 the something hidden from the enemy while 

00:04:41.270 --> 00:04:44.660
 we drag the area 

00:04:43.039 --> 00:04:46.490
 besides the silencers in metals 

00:04:44.660 --> 00:04:47.780
 light will get an optical effect of 

00:04:46.490 --> 00:04:49.729
 added stability 

00:04:47.780 --> 00:04:51.540
 so you will go with more confidence and more 

00:04:49.729 --> 00:04:53.610
 insurance 

00:04:51.540 --> 00:04:56.190
 he what is advantage refers we choose 

00:04:53.610 --> 00:04:58.140
 as a first lightweight advantage one of 

00:04:56.190 --> 00:05:00.240
 the drawbacks of Mecca 48 is the 

00:04:58.140 --> 00:05:02.330
 speed when moving that will be reduced in 

00:05:00.240 --> 00:05:04.830
 50% with respect to an assault rifle 

00:05:02.330 --> 00:05:06.480
 therefore light weight the one that 

00:05:04.830 --> 00:05:10.630
 difference is cut to a large extent 

00:05:06.480 --> 00:05:13.120
 something very useful from the battlefield 

00:05:10.630 --> 00:05:14.710
 as a second false advantage by essential 

00:05:13.120 --> 00:05:17.620
 for the combats outside the short ones 

00:05:14.710 --> 00:05:19.690
 distances may the m 48 have 

00:05:17.620 --> 00:05:21.910
 apprehension but this one will go to hell if 

00:05:19.690 --> 00:05:24.190
 they shoot us while we aim so 

00:05:21.910 --> 00:05:25.220
 hardness in our opinion is something very 

00:05:24.190 --> 00:05:27.200
 Useful 

00:05:25.220 --> 00:05:29.120
 put agile hands gives us the 

00:05:27.200 --> 00:05:30.830
 feeling of speed also since 

00:05:29.120 --> 00:05:33.200
 we change our weapon and we will launch equipment 

00:05:30.830 --> 00:05:35.570
 more quickly but not even remotely is it so 

00:05:33.200 --> 00:05:37.700
 useful as hardness and finally in the 

00:05:35.570 --> 00:05:40.490
 third slot extreme condition dexterity 

00:05:37.700 --> 00:05:42.050
 will be something very versatile skill in addition 

00:05:40.490 --> 00:05:44.000
 to help us climb through more surfaces 

00:05:42.050 --> 00:05:45.830
 quick so we can aim faster at 

00:05:44.000 --> 00:05:47.480
 stop correct and extreme conditions 

00:05:45.830 --> 00:05:49.100
 will extend the seconds of total sprint is 

00:05:47.480 --> 00:05:51.810
 something to go from end to end the 

00:05:49.100 --> 00:05:54.720
 map is not but that nothing else 

00:05:51.810 --> 00:05:55.919
 and here is our recommended class is 

00:05:54.720 --> 00:05:57.300
 one of the possible classes that in 

00:05:55.919 --> 00:05:59.310
 our opinion is better suited to the 

00:05:57.300 --> 00:06:00.690
 dynamic of the light inputs but 

00:05:59.310 --> 00:06:03.950
 each one will have a class that 

00:06:00.690 --> 00:06:03.950
 work better or worse 

00:06:04.520 --> 00:06:09.680
 in summary the mica 48 is a mastodon 

00:06:07.069 --> 00:06:11.870
 on any occasion damage reach 

00:06:09.680 --> 00:06:14.960
 precision never iron 100 bullets or 

00:06:11.870 --> 00:06:16.340
 135 with extended colors all these 

00:06:14.960 --> 00:06:18.319
 factors indicate that it is a weapon 

00:06:16.340 --> 00:06:20.539
 incredibly powerful that will serve us 

00:06:18.319 --> 00:06:22.250
 on any occasion being the stockings and 

00:06:20.539 --> 00:06:24.289
 the long distances where it stands out 

00:06:22.250 --> 00:06:26.000
 since they are in these distances where more 

00:06:24.289 --> 00:06:27.830
 profit we will get him killing from the 

00:06:26.000 --> 00:06:29.990
 same shots as at short distances 

00:06:27.830 --> 00:06:32.090
 the only downside that we find is a 

00:06:29.990 --> 00:06:33.949
 Slow recharge time of almost eight 

00:06:32.090 --> 00:06:35.569
 seconds that will make us have to 

00:06:33.949 --> 00:06:36.889
 take cover every so often for 

00:06:35.569 --> 00:06:38.449
 avoid being killed 

00:06:36.889 --> 00:06:40.449
 that's why carrying a secondary gun is 

00:06:38.449 --> 00:06:42.979
 incredibly useful in these occasions 

00:06:40.449 --> 00:06:46.510
 of note we put a 9 in the theory and 

00:06:42.979 --> 00:06:50.050
 another one in practice since it does not disappoint 

00:06:46.510 --> 00:06:53.880
 no doubt it will be a killing machine game 

00:06:50.050 --> 00:06:56.320
 jo jo ho ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha 

00:06:53.880 --> 00:06:59.100
 seriously to talk to the writer 

00:06:56.320 --> 00:06:59.100
 these degrading 

00:06:59.139 --> 00:07:02.370
 do not miss the next 

00:07:02.650 --> 00:07:05.639
 7
