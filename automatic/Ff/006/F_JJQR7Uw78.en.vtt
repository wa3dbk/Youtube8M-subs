you know for comparison I've got the

00:03:14.790 --> 00:03:17.780 
you know for comparison I've got the
Rajah<00:03:15.180> to<00:03:15.540> here<00:03:15.840> just<00:03:16.020> to<00:03:16.739> show<00:03:16.950> you<00:03:16.980> they're

virtually the same knife except for the

00:03:22.790 --> 00:03:28.040 
virtually the same knife except for the
materials<00:03:23.790> used<00:03:25.790> but<00:03:26.790> both<00:03:27.060> excellent<00:03:27.690> blades

00:03:33.440 --> 00:03:33.450 
you know the Rajah to I mean yeah it's

00:03:33.450 --> 00:03:35.360 
you know the Rajah to I mean yeah it's
the<00:03:33.540> same<00:03:33.780> thing<00:03:34.010> except<00:03:35.010> you<00:03:35.100> know<00:03:35.220> this

00:03:35.360 --> 00:03:35.370 
the same thing except you know this

00:03:35.370 --> 00:03:37.190 
the same thing except you know this
handle<00:03:35.790> of<00:03:35.820> course<00:03:36.180> is<00:03:36.540> a<00:03:36.570> different<00:03:37.080> material

00:03:37.190 --> 00:03:37.200 
handle of course is a different material

00:03:37.200 --> 00:03:40.910 
handle of course is a different material
good<00:03:38.100> material<00:03:38.550> grippy<00:03:39.590> probably<00:03:40.590> grippier

00:03:40.910 --> 00:03:40.920 
good material grippy probably grippier

00:03:40.920 --> 00:03:44.900 
good material grippy probably grippier
than<00:03:41.100> this<00:03:41.220> actually<00:03:42.650> but<00:03:43.650> um<00:03:43.830> same<00:03:44.640> you<00:03:44.880> know

00:03:44.900 --> 00:03:44.910 
than this actually but um same you know

00:03:44.910 --> 00:03:50.930 
than this actually but um same you know
andale<00:03:45.870> shape<00:03:46.110> everything<00:03:49.040> the<00:03:50.040> lock<00:03:50.250> just<00:03:50.790> as

00:03:50.930 --> 00:03:50.940 
andale shape everything the lock just as

00:03:50.940 --> 00:03:52.960 
andale shape everything the lock just as
strong<00:03:51.209> I<00:03:51.360> think<00:03:51.690> maybe<00:03:51.989> a<00:03:52.140> little<00:03:52.380> weaker

00:03:52.960 --> 00:03:52.970 
strong I think maybe a little weaker

00:03:52.970 --> 00:03:57.710 
strong I think maybe a little weaker
considering<00:03:53.970> the<00:03:54.140> materials<00:03:55.140> but<00:03:56.540> does<00:03:57.540> have

00:03:57.710 --> 00:03:57.720 
considering the materials but does have

00:03:57.720 --> 00:04:00.020 
considering the materials but does have
steel<00:03:58.440> liners<00:03:58.830> I<00:03:59.100> don't<00:03:59.489> know<00:03:59.550> if<00:03:59.610> you<00:03:59.670> can<00:03:59.760> see

00:04:00.020 --> 00:04:00.030 
steel liners I don't know if you can see

00:04:00.030 --> 00:04:01.820 
steel liners I don't know if you can see
can't<00:04:00.390> really<00:04:00.570> see<00:04:00.720> there<00:04:01.050> are<00:04:01.170> steel<00:04:01.470> liners

00:04:01.820 --> 00:04:01.830 
can't really see there are steel liners

00:04:01.830 --> 00:04:04.970 
can't really see there are steel liners
in<00:04:01.980> there<00:04:02.160> as<00:04:03.380> you<00:04:04.380> would<00:04:04.500> hope<00:04:04.650> there<00:04:04.890> would

00:04:04.970 --> 00:04:04.980 
in there as you would hope there would

00:04:04.980 --> 00:04:09.320 
in there as you would hope there would
be<00:04:05.570> just<00:04:06.570> a<00:04:06.720> little<00:04:06.750> bit<00:04:06.959> of<00:04:07.170> a<00:04:07.290> fun<00:04:08.330> size

00:04:09.320 --> 00:04:09.330 
be just a little bit of a fun size

00:04:09.330 --> 00:04:11.360 
be just a little bit of a fun size
comparison<00:04:10.140> for<00:04:10.440> other<00:04:10.739> knives<00:04:11.040> because

that's<00:04:11.640> always<00:04:11.820> interesting<00:04:12.209> to<00:04:12.450> do<00:04:12.690> this<00:04:13.080> is

00:04:13.250 --> 00:04:13.260 
that's always interesting to do this is

00:04:13.260 --> 00:04:17.570 
that's always interesting to do this is
a<00:04:13.290> cool<00:04:13.530> you'll<00:04:14.030> recon<00:04:15.380> 14<00:04:16.380> inch<00:04:16.560> blade<00:04:16.890> by<00:04:17.519> the

00:04:17.570 --> 00:04:17.580 
a cool you'll recon 14 inch blade by the

00:04:17.580 --> 00:04:20.000 
a cool you'll recon 14 inch blade by the
way<00:04:17.730> I<00:04:17.760> didn't<00:04:18.030> even<00:04:18.090> say<00:04:18.390> these<00:04:18.600> are<00:04:18.680> 66<00:04:19.680> inch

00:04:20.000 --> 00:04:20.010 
way I didn't even say these are 66 inch

00:04:20.010 --> 00:04:22.330 
way I didn't even say these are 66 inch
blades

00:04:22.330 --> 00:04:22.340 
blades

00:04:22.340 --> 00:04:28.460 
blades
so<00:04:23.540> yeah<00:04:24.540> it<00:04:24.840> looks<00:04:25.620> ridiculously<00:04:26.100> small<00:04:27.470> next

00:04:28.460 --> 00:04:28.470 
so yeah it looks ridiculously small next

00:04:28.470 --> 00:04:34.370 
so yeah it looks ridiculously small next
to<00:04:28.590> these<00:04:28.740> guys<00:04:28.980> and<00:04:31.790> let's<00:04:32.790> see<00:04:33.000> another<00:04:33.380> big

00:04:34.370 --> 00:04:34.380 
to these guys and let's see another big

00:04:34.380 --> 00:04:36.920 
to these guys and let's see another big
blade<00:04:34.710> I've<00:04:34.919> got<00:04:35.100> here<00:04:35.820> oh<00:04:36.090> why<00:04:36.720> don't<00:04:36.870> we

00:04:36.920 --> 00:04:36.930 
blade I've got here oh why don't we

00:04:36.930 --> 00:04:40.250 
blade I've got here oh why don't we
compare<00:04:37.290> it<00:04:37.350> to<00:04:37.530> one<00:04:37.830> of<00:04:37.860> the<00:04:38.960> more<00:04:39.960> heavy-duty

00:04:40.250 --> 00:04:40.260 
compare it to one of the more heavy-duty

00:04:40.260 --> 00:04:43.450 
compare it to one of the more heavy-duty
folders<00:04:40.860> out<00:04:41.040> there<00:04:41.340> the<00:04:41.580> zero<00:04:41.820> tolerance<00:04:42.030> 300

00:04:43.450 --> 00:04:43.460 
folders out there the zero tolerance 300

00:04:43.460 --> 00:04:46.730 
folders out there the zero tolerance 300
which<00:04:44.460> actually<00:04:44.669> next<00:04:45.630> to<00:04:45.720> the<00:04:45.900> cold<00:04:46.560> steel

00:04:46.730 --> 00:04:46.740 
which actually next to the cold steel

00:04:46.740 --> 00:04:48.260 
which actually next to the cold steel
recon<00:04:47.070> one<00:04:47.250> is<00:04:47.370> actually<00:04:47.699> a<00:04:47.729> little<00:04:47.910> smaller

00:04:48.260 --> 00:04:48.270 
recon one is actually a little smaller

00:04:48.270 --> 00:04:54.100 
recon one is actually a little smaller
in<00:04:49.190> fact<00:04:50.190> maybe<00:04:50.430> a<00:04:50.550> whole<00:04:50.669> half<00:04:50.910> inch<00:04:51.180> or<00:04:51.600> more

00:04:54.100 --> 00:04:54.110 

00:04:54.110 --> 00:05:03.320 

yeah<00:04:56.570> okay<00:04:57.570> well<00:05:00.889> what's<00:05:01.889> what<00:05:02.580> else<00:05:02.729> might<00:05:03.090> we

00:05:03.320 --> 00:05:03.330 
yeah okay well what's what else might we

00:05:03.330 --> 00:05:07.969 
yeah okay well what's what else might we
have<00:05:03.570> to<00:05:03.900> compare<00:05:04.290> it<00:05:04.320> to<00:05:04.520> how<00:05:05.520> about<00:05:06.979> Booker

00:05:07.969 --> 00:05:07.979 
have to compare it to how about Booker

00:05:07.979 --> 00:05:11.960 
have to compare it to how about Booker
Kalashnikov<00:05:08.639> 101<00:05:09.680> this<00:05:10.680> one<00:05:10.950> is<00:05:11.190> getting<00:05:11.940> a

00:05:11.960 --> 00:05:11.970 
Kalashnikov 101 this one is getting a

00:05:11.970 --> 00:05:13.550 
Kalashnikov 101 this one is getting a
little<00:05:12.120> bigger<00:05:12.450> than<00:05:12.630> some<00:05:12.900> of<00:05:13.020> these<00:05:13.110> yeah

00:05:13.550 --> 00:05:13.560 
little bigger than some of these yeah

00:05:13.560 --> 00:05:15.980 
little bigger than some of these yeah
okay<00:05:14.039> so<00:05:14.220> let's<00:05:14.580> see<00:05:14.820> how<00:05:14.850> it<00:05:15.030> compares<00:05:15.270> to<00:05:15.780> the

00:05:15.980 --> 00:05:15.990 
okay so let's see how it compares to the

00:05:15.990 --> 00:05:17.570 
okay so let's see how it compares to the
Kalasha<00:05:16.320> combo<00:05:16.710> too<00:05:16.889> many<00:05:17.070> sharp<00:05:17.370> edges

00:05:17.570 --> 00:05:17.580 
Kalasha combo too many sharp edges

00:05:17.580 --> 00:05:20.529 
Kalasha combo too many sharp edges
around<00:05:17.820> here<00:05:18.180> this<00:05:18.419> is<00:05:18.600> a<00:05:18.630> little<00:05:18.990> dangerous<00:05:19.229> I

00:05:20.529 --> 00:05:20.539 
around here this is a little dangerous I

00:05:20.539 --> 00:05:26.420 
around here this is a little dangerous I
was<00:05:21.539> getting<00:05:21.720> their<00:05:22.400> still<00:05:23.400> pretty<00:05:23.820> um<00:05:25.430> pretty

00:05:26.420 --> 00:05:26.430 
was getting their still pretty um pretty

00:05:26.430 --> 00:05:30.620 
was getting their still pretty um pretty
weak<00:05:26.669> in<00:05:26.850> comparison<00:05:28.639> but<00:05:29.639> just<00:05:30.030> to<00:05:30.240> just<00:05:30.570> to

00:05:30.620 --> 00:05:30.630 
weak in comparison but just to just to

00:05:30.630 --> 00:05:35.719 
weak in comparison but just to just to
kind<00:05:30.930> of<00:05:30.960> show<00:05:31.169> you<00:05:31.200> guys<00:05:31.919> I<00:05:34.460> think<00:05:35.460> this<00:05:35.550> is

00:05:35.719 --> 00:05:35.729 
kind of show you guys I think this is

00:05:35.729 --> 00:05:39.230 
kind of show you guys I think this is
probably<00:05:36.570> the<00:05:37.490> biggest<00:05:38.490> folder<00:05:38.970> I've<00:05:39.030> got

00:05:39.230 --> 00:05:39.240 
probably the biggest folder I've got

00:05:39.240 --> 00:05:44.610 
probably the biggest folder I've got
compared<00:05:39.630> to<00:05:39.750> the<00:05:40.490> garages

00:05:44.610 --> 00:05:44.620 

00:05:44.620 --> 00:05:52.680 

well<00:05:47.760> that's<00:05:48.760> about<00:05:48.910> it<00:05:50.790> just<00:05:51.790> really<00:05:52.150> wanted

00:05:52.680 --> 00:05:52.690 
well that's about it just really wanted

00:05:52.690 --> 00:05:54.240 
well that's about it just really wanted
to<00:05:52.810> show<00:05:52.840> these<00:05:53.169> off<00:05:53.380> I'm<00:05:53.680> probably<00:05:53.860> not<00:05:54.130> going

00:05:54.240 --> 00:05:54.250 
to show these off I'm probably not going

00:05:54.250 --> 00:05:55.620 
to show these off I'm probably not going
to<00:05:54.310> keep<00:05:54.490> this<00:05:54.610> night<00:05:54.850> forever<00:05:55.030> you<00:05:55.389> know<00:05:55.419> it's

00:05:55.620 --> 00:05:55.630 
to keep this night forever you know it's

00:05:55.630 --> 00:05:57.240 
to keep this night forever you know it's
a<00:05:55.690> cool<00:05:55.900> collector's<00:05:56.440> but<00:05:56.710> I'm<00:05:56.800> not<00:05:57.010> you<00:05:57.220> know

00:05:57.240 --> 00:05:57.250 
a cool collector's but I'm not you know

00:05:57.250 --> 00:05:59.129 
a cool collector's but I'm not you know
I'm<00:05:57.370> not<00:05:57.880> so<00:05:58.090> much<00:05:58.270> about<00:05:58.419> the<00:05:58.570> collecting

00:05:59.129 --> 00:05:59.139 
I'm not so much about the collecting

00:05:59.139 --> 00:06:02.460 
I'm not so much about the collecting
these<00:05:59.260> days<00:05:59.560> I<00:06:00.150> mean<00:06:01.150> I<00:06:01.270> used<00:06:01.540> to<00:06:01.720> used<00:06:02.199> to<00:06:02.290> be

00:06:02.460 --> 00:06:02.470 
these days I mean I used to used to be

00:06:02.470 --> 00:06:07.879 
these days I mean I used to used to be
more<00:06:02.710> into<00:06:02.889> that<00:06:02.919> but<00:06:05.160> yeah<00:06:06.160> just<00:06:06.490> a<00:06:06.729> really

00:06:07.879 --> 00:06:07.889 
more into that but yeah just a really

more into that but yeah just a really
definitely<00:06:08.889> one<00:06:09.100> that<00:06:09.430> it's<00:06:09.970> it's<00:06:10.330> a<00:06:10.449> shame

00:06:10.650 --> 00:06:10.660 
definitely one that it's it's a shame

00:06:10.660 --> 00:06:12.060 
definitely one that it's it's a shame
they<00:06:10.840> took<00:06:11.020> it<00:06:11.050> away<00:06:11.229> but<00:06:11.380> I<00:06:11.560> can<00:06:11.740> kind<00:06:11.949> of

00:06:12.060 --> 00:06:12.070 
they took it away but I can kind of

00:06:12.070 --> 00:06:14.939 
they took it away but I can kind of
understand<00:06:12.520> I<00:06:12.550> mean<00:06:12.820> it<00:06:12.940> was<00:06:13.150> pricey<00:06:13.510> and<00:06:13.949> you

00:06:16.230 --> 00:06:16.240 
know cold steel seems to be going after

00:06:16.240 --> 00:06:22.200 
know cold steel seems to be going after
the<00:06:16.540> more<00:06:17.080> affordable<00:06:17.789> market<00:06:19.080> so<00:06:20.580> well<00:06:21.580> hope
