pattern<00:00:43.680> like<00:00:44.460> I<00:00:44.550> said<00:00:44.730> that's<00:00:44.850> just<00:00:45.030> knits

00:00:45.560 --> 00:00:45.570 
pattern like I said that's just knits

now<00:00:49.079> I've<00:00:49.320> gone<00:00:49.500> ahead<00:00:49.620> and<00:00:49.800> cut<00:00:50.430> my<00:00:51.000> first

00:00:51.290 --> 00:00:51.300 
now I've gone ahead and cut my first

00:00:51.300 --> 00:00:56.139 
now I've gone ahead and cut my first
color<00:00:52.789> because<00:00:53.789> this<00:00:54.750> is<00:00:54.930> quite<00:00:55.440> a<00:00:55.469> long

00:00:56.139 --> 00:00:56.149 
color because this is quite a long

00:00:56.149 --> 00:00:58.910 
color because this is quite a long
stretch<00:00:57.149> to<00:00:57.449> be<00:00:57.539> carrying<00:00:57.960> up<00:00:58.140> the<00:00:58.410> two<00:00:58.559> colors

00:00:58.910 --> 00:00:58.920 
stretch to be carrying up the two colors

00:00:58.920 --> 00:01:01.520 
stretch to be carrying up the two colors
along<00:00:59.430> or<00:00:59.640> three<00:00:59.910> colors<00:01:00.090> rather<00:01:00.480> up<00:01:01.109> the<00:01:01.320> side

00:01:01.520 --> 00:01:01.530 
along or three colors rather up the side

00:01:01.530 --> 00:01:02.900 
along or three colors rather up the side
of<00:01:01.559> the<00:01:01.739> work<00:01:01.859> that's<00:01:02.100> one<00:01:02.340> option<00:01:02.760> when

00:01:02.900 --> 00:01:02.910 
of the work that's one option when

00:01:02.910 --> 00:01:04.850 
of the work that's one option when
you're<00:01:03.030> switching<00:01:03.239> colors<00:01:03.570> but<00:01:03.930> this<00:01:04.080> is<00:01:04.260> this

00:01:04.850 --> 00:01:04.860 
you're switching colors but this is this

00:01:04.860 --> 00:01:07.730 
you're switching colors but this is this
is<00:01:05.040> a<00:01:05.070> long<00:01:05.430> stretch<00:01:06.270> if<00:01:06.510> I<00:01:06.630> was<00:01:06.810> carrying<00:01:07.380> up

00:01:07.730 --> 00:01:07.740 
is a long stretch if I was carrying up

00:01:07.740 --> 00:01:09.560 
is a long stretch if I was carrying up
this<00:01:07.950> gray<00:01:08.220> down<00:01:08.460> here<00:01:08.700> all<00:01:08.939> the<00:01:09.270> way<00:01:09.360> up<00:01:09.390> here

00:01:09.560 --> 00:01:09.570 
this gray down here all the way up here

00:01:09.570 --> 00:01:11.990 
this gray down here all the way up here
to<00:01:10.229> switch<00:01:10.470> colors<00:01:10.710> there'd<00:01:11.130> be<00:01:11.220> a<00:01:11.250> long<00:01:11.490> float

00:01:11.990 --> 00:01:12.000 
to switch colors there'd be a long float

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:13.640 
to switch colors there'd be a long float
here<00:01:12.210> so<00:01:12.450> I'm<00:01:12.630> going<00:01:12.780> to<00:01:12.840> cut<00:01:13.049> colors<00:01:13.380> in

00:01:13.640 --> 00:01:13.650 
here so I'm going to cut colors in

00:01:13.650 --> 00:01:16.070 
here so I'm going to cut colors in
between<00:01:13.799> my<00:01:14.189> changes<00:01:14.700> now<00:01:15.450> I've<00:01:15.540> left<00:01:15.720> a<00:01:15.869> tail

I'm going to leave a tail about the same

00:01:40.650 --> 00:01:44.929 
I'm going to leave a tail about the same
length<00:01:40.860> as<00:01:42.200> my<00:01:43.200> yellow<00:01:43.649> and<00:01:43.890> just<00:01:43.979> begin

length as my yellow and just begin
knitting<00:01:45.689> with<00:01:45.990> the<00:01:46.110> grain

00:01:48.600 --> 00:01:48.610 

00:01:48.610 --> 00:01:50.850 

it's<00:01:49.000> this<00:01:49.240> rose<00:01:49.510> knit<00:01:49.990> all<00:01:50.530> the<00:01:50.560> way<00:01:50.770> across

00:01:50.850 --> 00:01:50.860 
it's this rose knit all the way across

00:01:50.860 --> 00:01:53.220 
it's this rose knit all the way across
man<00:01:51.400> you<00:01:51.490> can<00:01:51.640> see<00:01:51.850> as<00:01:51.970> I'm<00:01:52.150> knitting<00:01:52.390> that

00:01:53.220 --> 00:01:53.230 
man you can see as I'm knitting that

00:01:53.230 --> 00:01:55.790 
man you can see as I'm knitting that
this<00:01:53.530> first<00:01:53.860> stitch<00:01:54.220> is<00:01:54.490> kind<00:01:54.820> of<00:01:54.910> loose<00:01:55.180> and

00:01:55.790 --> 00:01:55.800 
this first stitch is kind of loose and

00:01:55.800 --> 00:01:58.740 
this first stitch is kind of loose and
that's<00:01:56.800> because<00:01:57.250> these<00:01:58.180> ends<00:01:58.600> aren't

00:01:58.740 --> 00:01:58.750 
that's because these ends aren't

00:01:58.750 --> 00:02:03.270 
that's because these ends aren't
anchored<00:01:59.200> to<00:01:59.230> anything<00:02:01.560> so<00:02:02.560> something<00:02:02.860> I<00:02:03.010> like

00:02:03.270 --> 00:02:03.280 
anchored to anything so something I like

00:02:03.280 --> 00:02:10.469 
anchored to anything so something I like
to<00:02:03.460> do<00:02:04.770> is<00:02:05.770> to<00:02:05.980> tie<00:02:06.220> a<00:02:06.250> knot<00:02:06.610> with<00:02:09.210> those<00:02:10.210> two

00:02:10.469 --> 00:02:10.479
