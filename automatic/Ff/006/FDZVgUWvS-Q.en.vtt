 it turned out so yes damn that's such 

00:03:11.180 --> 00:03:15.230
 cap but it happened and then we take 

00:03:12.890 --> 00:03:17.570
 half blocks and add paladin demigod total 

00:03:15.230 --> 00:03:22.850
 just one and add 8 what we do 

00:03:17.570 --> 00:03:24.620
 then take it like this 2 2 1 1 here 

00:03:22.850 --> 00:03:26.560
 so here and here so here we do this 

00:03:24.620 --> 00:03:30.730

 The house turned out to be exactly the same almost 

00:04:13.110 --> 00:04:17.820
 but we do not have enough buttons to add 

00:04:14.640 --> 00:04:19.440
 add buttons on the exit here's the board then 

00:04:17.820 --> 00:04:21.180

00:04:19.440 --> 00:04:23.250
 we get the button by the way I advise you 

00:04:21.180 --> 00:04:25.440

00:04:23.250 --> 00:04:27.870
 I can do honor here 

00:04:25.440 --> 00:04:29.880

00:04:40.380 --> 00:04:44.430
 It turned out all gorgeous so only 

00:04:42.120 --> 00:04:46.230

00:04:46.230 --> 00:04:50.640
 yes the same look as the cool 

00:04:48.540 --> 00:04:53.090
 It turns out that's awesome races further 

00:04:50.640 --> 00:04:56.040
 go inside and do some 

00:04:53.090 --> 00:04:58.020

00:04:56.040 --> 00:05:02.520
 have not yet figured out what question you are 

00:04:58.020 --> 00:05:05.190
 do it like this so here you will break 

00:05:02.520 --> 00:05:07.410
 here it is we will connect and send and 

00:05:05.190 --> 00:05:09.480

00:05:13.090 --> 00:05:16.600
 we got a cool floor 

00:05:14.500 --> 00:05:18.330
