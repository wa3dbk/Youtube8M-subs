00:00:12.289 --> 00:00:12.299 
so last year you made this quite a

00:00:12.299 --> 00:00:14.869 
so last year you made this quite a
time-consuming<00:00:12.750> exercise<00:00:13.530> on<00:00:13.740> purpose<00:00:14.219> this

00:00:14.869 --> 00:00:14.879 
time-consuming exercise on purpose this

00:00:14.879 --> 00:00:16.490 
time-consuming exercise on purpose this
year<00:00:15.240> looks<00:00:15.660> a<00:00:15.780> little<00:00:15.929> bit<00:00:16.110> more<00:00:16.230> flowing

00:00:16.490 --> 00:00:16.500 
year looks a little bit more flowing

00:00:16.500 --> 00:00:19.490 
year looks a little bit more flowing
you're<00:00:17.070> more<00:00:17.250> open<00:00:17.550> yeah<00:00:17.760> um<00:00:18.630> although<00:00:19.350> this

00:00:19.490 --> 00:00:19.500 
you're more open yeah um although this

00:00:19.500 --> 00:00:22.130 
you're more open yeah um although this
first<00:00:19.770> cabin<00:00:20.070> is<00:00:20.220> um<00:00:20.990> doesn't<00:00:21.990> actually

00:00:22.130 --> 00:00:22.140 
first cabin is um doesn't actually

00:00:22.140 --> 00:00:23.960 
first cabin is um doesn't actually
measure<00:00:22.410> very<00:00:22.650> big<00:00:22.830> but<00:00:23.010> it's<00:00:23.160> quite<00:00:23.670> imposing

00:00:23.960 --> 00:00:23.970 
measure very big but it's quite imposing

00:00:23.970 --> 00:00:26.509 
measure very big but it's quite imposing
up<00:00:24.300> on<00:00:24.449> them<00:00:24.599> up<00:00:25.140> on<00:00:25.320> the<00:00:25.410> hill<00:00:25.590> with<00:00:26.250> the<00:00:26.340> water

00:00:26.509 --> 00:00:26.519 
up on them up on the hill with the water

00:00:26.519 --> 00:00:31.130 
up on them up on the hill with the water
behind<00:00:26.760> and<00:00:27.830> and<00:00:28.830> actually<00:00:29.160> on<00:00:29.279> the<00:00:29.310> day<00:00:30.140> the

00:00:31.130 --> 00:00:31.140 
behind and and actually on the day the

00:00:31.140 --> 00:00:32.720 
behind and and actually on the day the
big<00:00:31.800> goose<00:00:31.980> that<00:00:32.160> they've<00:00:32.310> jumped<00:00:32.490> in<00:00:32.670> the

00:00:32.720 --> 00:00:32.730 
big goose that they've jumped in the

00:00:32.730 --> 00:00:36.470 
big goose that they've jumped in the
past<00:00:32.970> will<00:00:33.210> be<00:00:33.240> in<00:00:33.750> the<00:00:33.900> water<00:00:34.820> and<00:00:35.820> the<00:00:36.270> brush

00:00:36.470 --> 00:00:36.480 
past will be in the water and the brush

00:00:36.480 --> 00:00:38.960 
past will be in the water and the brush
you<00:00:36.600> see<00:00:36.810> on<00:00:36.960> the<00:00:37.050> right<00:00:37.200> and<00:00:37.650> we<00:00:37.830> like<00:00:38.490> a<00:00:38.520> like

00:00:38.960 --> 00:00:38.970 
you see on the right and we like a like

00:00:38.970 --> 00:00:42.230 
you see on the right and we like a like
a<00:00:39.000> nest<00:00:39.240> thing<00:00:40.340> related<00:00:41.340> distance<00:00:41.730> what<00:00:42.000> what

00:00:42.230 --> 00:00:42.240 
a nest thing related distance what what

00:00:42.240 --> 00:00:44.810 
a nest thing related distance what what
sort<00:00:42.480> of<00:00:42.570> I<00:00:42.750> mean<00:00:42.990> there's<00:00:43.200> there's<00:00:43.820> five

00:00:44.810 --> 00:00:44.820 
sort of I mean there's there's five

00:00:44.820 --> 00:00:47.000 
sort of I mean there's there's five
strides<00:00:45.420> down<00:00:45.660> there<00:00:45.900> but<00:00:46.080> I<00:00:46.290> think<00:00:46.890> you'll

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:47.010 
strides down there but I think you'll

00:00:47.010 --> 00:00:49.370 
strides down there but I think you'll
see<00:00:47.070> for<00:00:47.730> war<00:00:47.910> i<00:00:47.940> think<00:00:48.180> you<00:00:48.240> see<00:00:48.390> six<00:00:48.690> I<00:00:49.170> think

00:00:49.370 --> 00:00:49.380 
see for war i think you see six I think

00:00:49.380 --> 00:00:51.380 
see for war i think you see six I think
it's<00:00:49.500> see<00:00:49.560> all<00:00:49.680> sorts<00:00:49.920> because<00:00:50.640> it's<00:00:50.880> very

00:00:51.380 --> 00:00:51.390 
it's see all sorts because it's very

00:00:51.390 --> 00:00:53.450 
it's see all sorts because it's very
difficult<00:00:51.600> to<00:00:51.900> really<00:00:52.590> know<00:00:52.950> what<00:00:53.340> they're

00:00:53.450 --> 00:00:53.460 
difficult to really know what they're

00:00:53.460 --> 00:00:55.250 
difficult to really know what they're
going<00:00:53.580> to<00:00:53.640> do<00:00:53.820> on<00:00:53.970> a<00:00:54.000> banker's<00:00:54.540> steep<00:00:54.930> as<00:00:55.080> that

00:00:55.250 --> 00:00:55.260 
going to do on a banker's steep as that

00:00:55.260 --> 00:00:58.490 
going to do on a banker's steep as that
yeah<00:00:55.950> some<00:00:56.490> of<00:00:56.520> them<00:00:56.700> will<00:00:57.080> will<00:00:58.080> gain<00:00:58.290> a<00:00:58.320> bit

00:00:58.490 --> 00:00:58.500 
yeah some of them will will gain a bit

00:00:58.500 --> 00:00:59.960 
yeah some of them will will gain a bit
of<00:00:58.560> momentum<00:00:58.740> down<00:00:59.220> there<00:00:59.400> and<00:00:59.550> someone<00:00:59.760> will

00:00:59.960 --> 00:00:59.970 
of momentum down there and someone will

00:00:59.970 --> 00:01:02.420 
of momentum down there and someone will
back<00:01:00.120> up<00:01:00.300> particularly<00:01:01.260> with<00:01:01.380> them<00:01:01.590> the

00:01:02.420 --> 00:01:02.430 
back up particularly with them the

00:01:02.430 --> 00:01:04.189 
back up particularly with them the
thought<00:01:02.610> of<00:01:02.640> stepping<00:01:02.970> into<00:01:03.270> the<00:01:03.420> water<00:01:03.570> and

00:01:04.189 --> 00:01:04.199 
thought of stepping into the water and

00:01:04.199 --> 00:01:05.750 
thought of stepping into the water and
that's<00:01:04.409> a<00:01:04.500> pretty<00:01:04.680> serious<00:01:04.949> fence<00:01:05.369> to<00:01:05.549> jump

00:01:05.750 --> 00:01:05.760 
that's a pretty serious fence to jump

00:01:05.760 --> 00:01:11.650 
that's a pretty serious fence to jump
out<00:01:05.880> of<00:01:06.000> water<00:01:06.890> no<00:01:07.890> means<00:01:08.630> it's<00:01:09.630> not<00:01:10.290> too<00:01:10.440> bad

00:01:11.650 --> 00:01:11.660 
out of water no means it's not too bad

00:01:11.660 --> 00:01:15.230 
out of water no means it's not too bad
we<00:01:12.660> were<00:01:12.720> on<00:01:12.810> the<00:01:12.990> first<00:01:13.260> s-bend<00:01:14.220> to<00:01:14.820> then<00:01:14.970> come

00:01:15.230 --> 00:01:15.240 
we were on the first s-bend to then come

00:01:15.240 --> 00:01:17.180 
we were on the first s-bend to then come
back<00:01:15.300> into<00:01:15.840> the<00:01:16.080> second<00:01:16.410> track<00:01:16.740> to<00:01:16.890> the<00:01:16.920> top

00:01:17.180 --> 00:01:17.190 
back into the second track to the top

00:01:17.190 --> 00:01:19.910 
back into the second track to the top
end<00:01:17.400> of<00:01:17.580> it<00:01:18.140> what<00:01:19.140> makes<00:01:19.320> it<00:01:19.410> difficult<00:01:19.590> is<00:01:19.830> a

00:01:19.910 --> 00:01:19.920 
end of it what makes it difficult is a

00:01:19.920 --> 00:01:21.980 
end of it what makes it difficult is a
little<00:01:20.340> bit<00:01:20.460> of<00:01:20.550> a<00:01:20.610> downslope<00:01:21.540> on<00:01:21.690> takeoff

00:01:21.980 --> 00:01:21.990 
little bit of a downslope on takeoff

00:01:21.990 --> 00:01:23.210 
little bit of a downslope on takeoff
it's<00:01:22.170> actually<00:01:22.380> what<00:01:22.470> makes<00:01:22.650> it<00:01:22.770> a<00:01:22.860> little

00:01:23.210 --> 00:01:23.220 
it's actually what makes it a little

00:01:23.220 --> 00:01:26.180 
it's actually what makes it a little
difficult<00:01:23.360> because<00:01:24.360> it's<00:01:24.900> sometimes<00:01:25.380> the

00:01:26.180 --> 00:01:26.190 
difficult because it's sometimes the

00:01:26.190 --> 00:01:28.340 
difficult because it's sometimes the
riders<00:01:26.550> don't<00:01:27.330> really<00:01:27.660> understand<00:01:28.080> how<00:01:28.290> the

00:01:28.340 --> 00:01:28.350 
riders don't really understand how the

00:01:28.350 --> 00:01:30.010 
riders don't really understand how the
horse<00:01:28.590> is<00:01:28.710> going<00:01:28.890> to<00:01:28.950> land<00:01:29.070> in<00:01:29.280> the<00:01:29.670> water

00:01:30.010 --> 00:01:30.020 
horse is going to land in the water

00:01:30.020 --> 00:01:32.149 
horse is going to land in the water
sometimes<00:01:31.020> they<00:01:31.170> land<00:01:31.350> normal<00:01:31.680> but<00:01:31.830> sometimes

00:01:32.149 --> 00:01:32.159 
sometimes they land normal but sometimes

00:01:32.159 --> 00:01:36.290 
sometimes they land normal but sometimes
around<00:01:32.400> four<00:01:32.940> footed<00:01:33.150> and<00:01:33.930> that<00:01:34.110> makes<00:01:35.300> the

00:01:36.290 --> 00:01:36.300 
around four footed and that makes the

00:01:36.300 --> 00:01:37.880 
around four footed and that makes the
whole<00:01:36.570> thing<00:01:36.630> get<00:01:36.900> a<00:01:36.930> bit<00:01:37.140> discombobulated

00:01:37.880 --> 00:01:37.890 
whole thing get a bit discombobulated

00:01:37.890 --> 00:01:40.430 
whole thing get a bit discombobulated
and<00:01:38.280> then<00:01:38.610> probably<00:01:39.390> if<00:01:39.750> you<00:01:39.840> do<00:01:39.990> land<00:01:40.200> for

00:01:40.430 --> 00:01:40.440 
and then probably if you do land for

00:01:40.440 --> 00:01:42.170 
and then probably if you do land for
footage<00:01:40.740> you're<00:01:40.920> not<00:01:41.130> want<00:01:41.430> to<00:01:41.520> get<00:01:41.670> going<00:01:42.090> to

00:01:42.170 --> 00:01:42.180 
footage you're not want to get going to

00:01:42.180 --> 00:01:44.000 
footage you're not want to get going to
want<00:01:42.330> to<00:01:42.390> go<00:01:42.540> straight<00:01:43.260> on<00:01:43.409> the<00:01:43.530> three<00:01:43.740> strides

00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:44.010 
want to go straight on the three strides

00:01:44.010 --> 00:01:46.040 
want to go straight on the three strides
and<00:01:44.220> then<00:01:44.340> the<00:01:44.460> bands<00:01:44.760> over<00:01:45.150> the<00:01:45.180> hedge<00:01:45.390> you're

00:01:46.040 --> 00:01:46.050 
and then the bands over the hedge you're

00:01:46.050 --> 00:01:47.600 
and then the bands over the hedge you're
pretty<00:01:46.200> betta<00:01:46.409> graph<00:01:46.650> on<00:01:46.770> the<00:01:46.830> bank<00:01:47.010> and<00:01:47.159> to<00:01:47.280> do

00:01:47.600 --> 00:01:47.610 
pretty betta graph on the bank and to do

00:01:47.610 --> 00:01:49.969 
pretty betta graph on the bank and to do
a<00:01:47.640> circle<00:01:48.060> because<00:01:48.360> you<00:01:49.290> sort<00:01:49.470> of<00:01:49.530> get<00:01:49.680> the

00:01:49.969 --> 00:01:49.979 
a circle because you sort of get the

00:01:49.979 --> 00:01:52.850 
a circle because you sort of get the
rider<00:01:50.460> gets<00:01:50.610> a<00:01:50.729> bit<00:01:50.850> shifted<00:01:51.500> in<00:01:52.500> the<00:01:52.530> plate

00:01:52.850 --> 00:01:52.860 
rider gets a bit shifted in the plate

00:01:52.860 --> 00:01:54.560 
rider gets a bit shifted in the plate
and<00:01:53.100> of<00:01:53.640> course<00:01:53.790> you<00:01:53.880> lose<00:01:54.060> all<00:01:54.210> the<00:01:54.330> momentum

00:01:54.560 --> 00:01:54.570 
and of course you lose all the momentum

00:01:54.570 --> 00:01:56.480 
and of course you lose all the momentum
this<00:01:55.290> is<00:01:55.440> probably<00:01:55.650> the<00:01:55.770> most<00:01:55.950> intense<00:01:56.340> part

00:01:56.480 --> 00:01:56.490 
this is probably the most intense part

00:01:56.490 --> 00:01:59.450 
this is probably the most intense part
of<00:01:56.820> the<00:01:56.909> course<00:01:57.229> because<00:01:58.229> the<00:01:58.560> cab<00:01:58.770> in<00:01:58.950> the

00:01:59.450 --> 00:01:59.460 
of the course because the cab in the

00:01:59.460 --> 00:02:01.670 
of the course because the cab in the
goose<00:01:59.670> nests<00:02:00.120> this<00:02:00.330> that<00:02:00.780> all<00:02:01.200> comes<00:02:01.440> up<00:02:01.650> very

00:02:01.670 --> 00:02:01.680 
goose nests this that all comes up very

00:02:01.680 --> 00:02:05.180 
goose nests this that all comes up very
very<00:02:02.130> quickly<00:02:03.049> we've<00:02:04.049> got<00:02:04.320> one<00:02:04.680> two<00:02:04.710> three

00:02:05.180 --> 00:02:05.190 
very quickly we've got one two three

00:02:05.190 --> 00:02:07.010 
very quickly we've got one two three
four<00:02:05.310> five<00:02:05.549> efforts<00:02:05.970> and<00:02:06.120> space<00:02:06.479> of<00:02:06.630> about<00:02:06.690> 20

00:02:07.010 --> 00:02:07.020 
four five efforts and space of about 20

00:02:07.020 --> 00:02:09.680 
four five efforts and space of about 20
seconds<00:02:07.519> so<00:02:08.519> not<00:02:08.700> it<00:02:08.819> has<00:02:09.179> a<00:02:09.209> nice<00:02:09.390> feel

00:02:09.680 --> 00:02:09.690 
seconds so not it has a nice feel

00:02:09.690 --> 00:02:11.090 
seconds so not it has a nice feel
they're<00:02:09.899> nice<00:02:10.050> playing<00:02:10.380> field<00:02:10.679> i'll<00:02:10.830> be<00:02:11.009> able

00:02:11.090 --> 00:02:11.100 
they're nice playing field i'll be able

00:02:11.100 --> 00:02:13.640 
they're nice playing field i'll be able
to<00:02:11.310> to<00:02:11.700> keep<00:02:11.880> the<00:02:12.000> rhythm<00:02:12.150> going<00:02:12.450> and<00:02:12.660> and<00:02:12.900> as

00:02:13.640 --> 00:02:13.650 
to to keep the rhythm going and and as

00:02:13.650 --> 00:02:15.059 
to to keep the rhythm going and and as
they<00:02:13.890> head<00:02:14.069> out<00:02:14.220> and<00:02:14.340> actually

00:02:15.059 --> 00:02:15.069 
they head out and actually

00:02:15.069 --> 00:02:17.610 
they head out and actually
people<00:02:15.459> stumble<00:02:15.939> that<00:02:16.120> what<00:02:16.420> is<00:02:16.569> only<00:02:16.780> in<00:02:17.349> fact

00:02:17.610 --> 00:02:17.620 
people stumble that what is only in fact

00:02:17.620 --> 00:02:19.920 
people stumble that what is only in fact
a<00:02:17.739> hazard<00:02:18.159> here<00:02:18.400> the<00:02:18.760> riders<00:02:19.389> do<00:02:19.510> have<00:02:19.689> to<00:02:19.810> be

00:02:19.920 --> 00:02:19.930 
a hazard here the riders do have to be

00:02:19.930 --> 00:02:21.599 
a hazard here the riders do have to be
aware<00:02:20.200> and<00:02:20.439> actually<00:02:20.769> ride<00:02:21.010> this<00:02:21.310> stream

00:02:21.599 --> 00:02:21.609 
aware and actually ride this stream

00:02:21.609 --> 00:02:23.220 
aware and actually ride this stream
crossing<00:02:22.030> as<00:02:22.120> they<00:02:22.269> head<00:02:22.420> away<00:02:22.540> up<00:02:22.810> to<00:02:22.840> the<00:02:23.079> top

00:02:23.220 --> 00:02:23.230 
crossing as they head away up to the top

00:02:23.230 --> 00:02:26.489 
crossing as they head away up to the top
yes<00:02:24.159> I<00:02:24.280> mean<00:02:24.400> it<00:02:24.489> just<00:02:24.609> just<00:02:25.329> a<00:02:25.420> hazard<00:02:25.749> but<00:02:25.900> the

00:02:26.489 --> 00:02:26.499 
yes I mean it just just a hazard but the

00:02:26.499 --> 00:02:28.800 
yes I mean it just just a hazard but the
I<00:02:27.069> think<00:02:27.760> the<00:02:27.819> trouble<00:02:28.090> is<00:02:28.209> them<00:02:28.389> know<00:02:28.689> when

00:02:28.800 --> 00:02:28.810 
I think the trouble is them know when

00:02:28.810 --> 00:02:31.289 
I think the trouble is them know when
it's<00:02:28.930> full<00:02:29.109> of<00:02:29.200> water<00:02:29.379> but<00:02:30.340> when<00:02:31.060> the<00:02:31.090> horse

00:02:31.289 --> 00:02:31.299 
it's full of water but when the horse

00:02:31.299 --> 00:02:32.369 
it's full of water but when the horse
steps<00:02:31.510> into<00:02:31.659> the<00:02:31.750> water<00:02:31.959> not<00:02:32.170> quite<00:02:32.349> sure

00:02:32.369 --> 00:02:32.379 
steps into the water not quite sure

00:02:32.379 --> 00:02:35.039 
steps into the water not quite sure
whether<00:02:32.739> it's<00:02:32.920> six<00:02:33.519> inches<00:02:33.760> deeper<00:02:34.120> or<00:02:34.750> two

00:02:35.039 --> 00:02:35.049 
whether it's six inches deeper or two

00:02:35.049 --> 00:02:36.509 
whether it's six inches deeper or two
feet<00:02:35.260> deep<00:02:35.349> this<00:02:35.680> is<00:02:35.769> not<00:02:35.859> quite<00:02:36.040> sure<00:02:36.099> where

00:02:36.509 --> 00:02:36.519 
feet deep this is not quite sure where

00:02:36.519 --> 00:02:37.740 
feet deep this is not quite sure where
the<00:02:36.639> bottom<00:02:36.879> is<00:02:36.939> that's<00:02:37.209> why<00:02:37.299> we<00:02:37.389> sending<00:02:37.659> it

00:02:37.740 --> 00:02:37.750 
the bottom is that's why we sending it

00:02:37.750 --> 00:02:39.509 
the bottom is that's why we sending it
occasionally<00:02:38.650> get<00:02:38.829> the<00:02:38.950> odd<00:02:39.040> full<00:02:39.280> step

00:02:39.509 --> 00:02:39.519 
occasionally get the odd full step

00:02:39.519 --> 00:02:42.240 
occasionally get the odd full step
you've<00:02:40.090> left<00:02:40.480> this<00:02:40.750> first<00:02:41.049> one<00:02:41.260> in<00:02:41.379> which<00:02:41.530> as<00:02:41.829> I

00:02:42.240 --> 00:02:42.250 
you've left this first one in which as I

00:02:42.250 --> 00:02:44.640 
you've left this first one in which as I
said<00:02:42.280> last<00:02:42.939> year<00:02:43.180> was<00:02:43.510> was<00:02:44.260> really<00:02:44.499> quite

00:02:44.640 --> 00:02:44.650 
said last year was was really quite

00:02:44.650 --> 00:02:46.319 
said last year was was really quite
shocking<00:02:45.099> for<00:02:45.280> people<00:02:45.519> they<00:02:45.639> were<00:02:45.700> thinking

00:02:46.319 --> 00:02:46.329 
shocking for people they were thinking

00:02:46.329 --> 00:02:48.929 
shocking for people they were thinking
he's<00:02:46.480> gone<00:02:46.659> completely<00:02:46.870> bonkers<00:02:47.819> it<00:02:48.819> would

00:02:48.929 --> 00:02:48.939 
he's gone completely bonkers it would

00:02:48.939 --> 00:02:50.909 
he's gone completely bonkers it would
actually<00:02:49.030> read<00:02:49.359> quite<00:02:49.540> well<00:02:49.689> yes<00:02:49.989> few<00:02:50.709> people

00:02:50.909 --> 00:02:50.919 
actually read quite well yes few people

00:02:50.919 --> 00:02:52.530 
actually read quite well yes few people
had<00:02:51.010> a<00:02:51.040> bit<00:02:51.159> of<00:02:51.189> an<00:02:51.340> incident<00:02:51.519> but<00:02:51.849> the<00:02:52.299> vast

00:02:52.530 --> 00:02:52.540 
had a bit of an incident but the vast

00:02:52.540 --> 00:02:56.520 
had a bit of an incident but the vast
majority<00:02:52.629> jumped<00:02:53.409> it<00:02:53.500> really<00:02:53.709> one<00:02:53.859> so<00:02:54.159> I<00:02:55.530> think

00:02:56.520 --> 00:02:56.530 
majority jumped it really one so I think

00:02:56.530 --> 00:02:58.649 
majority jumped it really one so I think
we<00:02:56.620> won't<00:02:56.769> have<00:02:56.949> quite<00:02:57.849> the<00:02:57.879> same<00:02:58.150> fear<00:02:58.419> of<00:02:58.540> it

00:02:58.649 --> 00:02:58.659 
we won't have quite the same fear of it

00:02:58.659 --> 00:03:00.899 
we won't have quite the same fear of it
this<00:02:59.319> time<00:02:59.379> but<00:02:59.620> I<00:02:59.949> think's<00:03:00.280> hopefully<00:03:00.669> still

00:03:00.899 --> 00:03:00.909 
this time but I think's hopefully still

00:03:00.909 --> 00:03:04.170 
this time but I think's hopefully still
respected<00:03:01.569> and<00:03:02.459> yeah<00:03:03.459> God<00:03:03.639> willing<00:03:03.939> we'll<00:03:04.030> get

00:03:04.170 --> 00:03:04.180 
respected and yeah God willing we'll get

00:03:04.180 --> 00:03:06.360 
respected and yeah God willing we'll get
some<00:03:04.299> good<00:03:04.389> pictures<00:03:04.449> here<00:03:04.870> hmm<00:03:05.439> I<00:03:05.680> mean<00:03:06.219> it's

00:03:06.360 --> 00:03:06.370 
some good pictures here hmm I mean it's

00:03:06.370 --> 00:03:08.459 
some good pictures here hmm I mean it's
it's<00:03:06.730> a<00:03:06.819> big<00:03:07.000> corner<00:03:07.269> and<00:03:07.659> obviously<00:03:08.169> your

00:03:08.459 --> 00:03:08.469 
it's a big corner and obviously your

00:03:08.469 --> 00:03:10.289 
it's a big corner and obviously your
approach<00:03:08.769> is<00:03:08.799> limited<00:03:09.370> by<00:03:09.549> the<00:03:09.609> topography

00:03:10.289 --> 00:03:10.299 
approach is limited by the topography

00:03:10.299 --> 00:03:13.559 
approach is limited by the topography
coming<00:03:10.959> into<00:03:11.230> it<00:03:11.349> but<00:03:11.849> you<00:03:12.849> can<00:03:13.090> run<00:03:13.299> straight

00:03:13.559 --> 00:03:13.569 
coming into it but you can run straight

00:03:13.569 --> 00:03:14.939 
coming into it but you can run straight
along<00:03:13.719> the<00:03:13.840> top<00:03:14.019> all<00:03:14.230> come<00:03:14.590> a<00:03:14.620> little<00:03:14.799> bit

00:03:14.939 --> 00:03:14.949 
along the top all come a little bit

00:03:14.949 --> 00:03:16.949 
along the top all come a little bit
further<00:03:15.219> right<00:03:15.459> yeah<00:03:16.209> but<00:03:16.359> there<00:03:16.689> will<00:03:16.840> be<00:03:16.870> a

00:03:16.949 --> 00:03:16.959 
further right yeah but there will be a

00:03:16.959 --> 00:03:18.780 
further right yeah but there will be a
bit<00:03:17.109> of<00:03:17.230> a<00:03:17.319> sort<00:03:17.469> of<00:03:17.500> farmyard<00:03:17.980> scene<00:03:18.250> down

00:03:18.780 --> 00:03:18.790 
bit of a sort of farmyard scene down

00:03:18.790 --> 00:03:20.999 
bit of a sort of farmyard scene down
here<00:03:18.819> because<00:03:19.349> they're<00:03:20.349> too<00:03:20.560> far<00:03:20.769> to<00:03:20.979> the

00:03:20.999 --> 00:03:21.009 
here because they're too far to the

00:03:21.009 --> 00:03:23.580 
here because they're too far to the
right<00:03:21.449> the<00:03:22.449> horses<00:03:22.659> couldn't<00:03:22.989> really<00:03:23.290> read

00:03:23.580 --> 00:03:23.590 
right the horses couldn't really read

00:03:23.590 --> 00:03:25.170 
right the horses couldn't really read
the<00:03:23.620> back<00:03:23.949> of<00:03:24.069> the<00:03:24.159> corner<00:03:24.519> from<00:03:24.639> from<00:03:24.970> down

00:03:25.170 --> 00:03:25.180 
the back of the corner from from down

00:03:25.180 --> 00:03:26.580 
the back of the corner from from down
there<00:03:25.389> and<00:03:25.629> therefore<00:03:25.750> that<00:03:25.959> would<00:03:26.199> not<00:03:26.560> be

00:03:26.580 --> 00:03:26.590 
there and therefore that would not be

00:03:26.590 --> 00:03:29.249 
there and therefore that would not be
such<00:03:26.799> a<00:03:26.829> good<00:03:26.919> idea<00:03:27.069> but<00:03:27.909> long<00:03:28.150> as<00:03:28.239> they<00:03:28.329> come<00:03:28.540> a

00:03:29.249 --> 00:03:29.259 
such a good idea but long as they come a

00:03:29.259 --> 00:03:31.409 
such a good idea but long as they come a
part<00:03:30.189> way<00:03:30.340> along<00:03:30.549> the<00:03:30.699> top<00:03:30.879> here<00:03:30.909> they<00:03:31.269> can

00:03:31.409 --> 00:03:31.419 
part way along the top here they can

00:03:31.419 --> 00:03:32.729 
part way along the top here they can
understand<00:03:31.840> the<00:03:31.959> whole<00:03:32.079> question<00:03:32.439> and<00:03:32.620> see

00:03:32.729 --> 00:03:32.739 
understand the whole question and see

00:03:32.739 --> 00:03:35.280 
understand the whole question and see
where<00:03:32.859> they've<00:03:32.979> gotta<00:03:33.129> go
