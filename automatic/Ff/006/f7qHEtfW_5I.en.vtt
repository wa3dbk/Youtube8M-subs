00:00:07.690 --> 00:00:15.160 

how<00:00:08.690> you<00:00:08.750> doing

00:00:15.160 --> 00:00:15.170 

00:00:15.170 --> 00:00:18.420 

up<00:00:15.290> in<00:00:15.440> the<00:00:15.530> woods<00:00:15.790> and<00:00:16.790> noticing<00:00:17.360> that<00:00:17.390> there

00:00:18.420 --> 00:00:18.430 
up in the woods and noticing that there

00:00:18.430 --> 00:00:24.330 
up in the woods and noticing that there
these<00:00:19.430> poles<00:00:19.790> rocks<00:00:20.119> quartz<00:00:20.810> and<00:00:22.390> scalp<00:00:23.390> off

00:00:24.330 --> 00:00:24.340 
these poles rocks quartz and scalp off

00:00:24.340 --> 00:00:32.549 
these poles rocks quartz and scalp off
and<00:00:25.840> so<00:00:27.160> I'm<00:00:28.160> guessing<00:00:28.640> if<00:00:29.630> York<00:00:29.930> here<00:00:31.000> just

00:00:32.549 --> 00:00:32.559 
and so I'm guessing if York here just

00:00:32.559 --> 00:00:37.200 
and so I'm guessing if York here just
all<00:00:33.559> pause<00:00:33.920> and<00:00:34.309> pause<00:00:34.460> and<00:00:34.760> pause<00:00:35.739> Thane<00:00:36.739> is

00:00:37.200 --> 00:00:37.210 
all pause and pause and pause Thane is

00:00:37.210 --> 00:00:43.930 
all pause and pause and pause Thane is
as<00:00:38.210> you<00:00:38.629> can<00:00:38.750> see<00:00:39.430> the<00:00:42.460> they<00:00:43.460> tend<00:00:43.730> to<00:00:43.790> be

00:00:43.930 --> 00:00:43.940 
as you can see the they tend to be

00:00:43.940 --> 00:00:47.049 
as you can see the they tend to be
caving<00:00:44.210> in<00:00:44.480> as<00:00:44.660> well<00:00:44.930> so<00:00:45.260> I<00:00:45.739> mean<00:00:46.670> I'm<00:00:46.820> quite
