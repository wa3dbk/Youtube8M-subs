00:00:20.160 --> 00:00:24.540
 hello everyone surgery and 

00:00:22.380 --> 00:00:26.970
 Welcome to a trick mode 

00:00:24.540 --> 00:00:29.220
 multiplayer of grand theft auto 5 and 

00:00:26.970 --> 00:00:31.830
 this trick is to put images 

00:00:29.220 --> 00:00:34.559
 created for your emblem of the crew a 

00:00:31.830 --> 00:00:36.660
 trick the truth so well then I'll 

00:00:34.559 --> 00:00:38.340
 teach the two methods I recommend 

00:00:36.660 --> 00:00:40.050
 use the second method because it's the 

00:00:38.340 --> 00:00:42.300
 easier and the one that we can use 

00:00:40.050 --> 00:00:45.330
 whenever we want and as I say 

00:00:42.300 --> 00:00:47.070
 you can use any image that 

00:00:45.330 --> 00:00:49.769
 you want so much from google images or 

00:00:47.070 --> 00:00:51.720
 create them you with cinema 4d put it 

00:00:49.769 --> 00:00:53.430
 with photoshop and make them mounts 

00:00:51.720 --> 00:00:55.800
 what many of you do who fx 

00:00:53.430 --> 00:00:57.360
 and so good everything first that 

00:00:55.800 --> 00:00:59.399
 we will have to do is open the 

00:00:57.360 --> 00:01:00.629
 photoshop if you want to take the 

00:00:59.399 --> 00:01:02.399
 measures because the measures that 

00:01:00.629 --> 00:01:06.899
 we will need are very important 

00:01:02.399 --> 00:01:09.060
 512 are fulfilled by 512 pixels already 

00:01:06.899 --> 00:01:13.289
 we'll see what the new file will give 

00:01:09.060 --> 00:01:15.810
 new 512 pixels by 512 pixels 

00:01:13.289 --> 00:01:18.090
 then when we already have this 

00:01:15.810 --> 00:01:21.210
 we give ok then what to do now 

00:01:18.090 --> 00:01:23.610
 is to reduce the image with the magnifying glass 

00:01:21.210 --> 00:01:25.349
 ok because I already put a pretty image 

00:01:23.610 --> 00:01:26.640
 large I'll do smaller there 

00:01:25.349 --> 00:01:28.860
 the foods that we have 

00:01:26.640 --> 00:01:31.020
 I have taken the 

00:01:28.860 --> 00:01:33.060
 the same Manchester shield to make 

00:01:31.020 --> 00:01:34.350
 an example and so good what 

00:01:33.060 --> 00:01:36.750
 I recommend is to take away the white background 

00:01:34.350 --> 00:01:38.130
 because if it will not look white like you have 

00:01:36.750 --> 00:01:39.900
 seen at the beginning of the video and there is no 

00:01:38.130 --> 00:01:42.120
 good but good when we already have everything 

00:01:39.900 --> 00:01:44.220
 ready we give you to save in format 

00:01:42.120 --> 00:01:46.410
 photoshop to save a copy of it 

00:01:44.220 --> 00:01:48.090
 we put a title a name when 

00:01:46.410 --> 00:01:49.860
 we are saving it and now we go back to 

00:01:48.090 --> 00:01:52.110
 save again and this time in format 

00:01:49.860 --> 00:01:55.140
 PNG which is the one we will use for 

00:01:52.110 --> 00:01:57.180
 create the svg image there we will see and the 

00:01:55.140 --> 00:01:58.710
 first method would be with the page 

00:01:57.180 --> 00:02:00.600
 magic vector that I will leave you in the 

00:01:58.710 --> 00:02:03.150
 description the page so that the 

00:02:00.600 --> 00:02:04.830
 interesting and from the link so good 

00:02:03.150 --> 00:02:06.210
 what we have to do is raise the 

00:02:04.830 --> 00:02:08.429
 image from here as we are seeing 

00:02:06.210 --> 00:02:10.800
 there I do not do it because I tell you that 

00:02:08.429 --> 00:02:12.840
 I do not recommend this method because if 

00:02:10.800 --> 00:02:14.760
 convert svg image that is very 

00:02:12.840 --> 00:02:16.620
 important to do that what will happen that 

00:02:14.760 --> 00:02:19.560
 you can only convert two images by 

00:02:16.620 --> 00:02:22.110
 ip and I could change state or have 

00:02:19.560 --> 00:02:23.340
 could modify up to eight images what 

00:02:22.110 --> 00:02:26.190
 it happens that there are other people who do not 

00:02:23.340 --> 00:02:29.160
 leaves and we go that usually only 

00:02:26.190 --> 00:02:30.640
 can use or convert images 

00:02:29.160 --> 00:02:33.040
 in his old age 

00:02:30.640 --> 00:02:34.690
 and two fish per ipe so no 

00:02:33.040 --> 00:02:37.600
 I recommend doing this method but if 

00:02:34.690 --> 00:02:38.620
 you want to do good as you want, not like that 

00:02:37.600 --> 00:02:40.450
 that what we have to do is give it 

00:02:38.620 --> 00:02:42.670
 out loud 'is worth here and then 

00:02:40.450 --> 00:02:44.950
 We put the image will ask us with our 

00:02:42.670 --> 00:02:47.380
 gmail we put it will give us a password 

00:02:44.950 --> 00:02:50.680
 in the mail and a verification code 

00:02:47.380 --> 00:02:52.660
 you put it there and then it will ask you in 

00:02:50.680 --> 00:02:55.209
 format you want to save it for what 

00:02:52.660 --> 00:02:57.670
 we will save in svc there we will see it in its 

00:02:55.209 --> 00:02:59.530
 time and we even keep it now I'm going to 

00:02:57.670 --> 00:03:00.790
 teach that the second method and the 

00:02:59.530 --> 00:03:02.410
 second method is with a program what 

00:03:00.790 --> 00:03:03.940
 you will have to download and create it 

00:03:02.410 --> 00:03:06.940
 you can not explain it so 

00:03:03.940 --> 00:03:08.170
 you will have to search on youtube how 

00:03:06.940 --> 00:03:09.790
 download this program that is the 

00:03:08.170 --> 00:03:11.560
 vector magic program or whatever it 

00:03:09.790 --> 00:03:14.290
 we used before was the program and 

00:03:11.560 --> 00:03:15.820
 this time on the website and this time 

00:03:14.290 --> 00:03:17.620
 we will use the program that also 

00:03:15.820 --> 00:03:19.060
 there is the same name in it 

00:03:17.620 --> 00:03:20.830
 name because it is exactly the same 

00:03:19.060 --> 00:03:22.570
 but in program so you'll have it 

00:03:20.830 --> 00:03:24.160
 create it is very easy to create royal to 

00:03:22.570 --> 00:03:25.660
 you will look up on youtube and when 

00:03:24.160 --> 00:03:26.590
 let's have the program ready for 

00:03:25.660 --> 00:03:28.840
 use it 

00:03:26.590 --> 00:03:31.450
 we will have to drag the image that 

00:03:28.840 --> 00:03:33.519
 we want there to the program and 

00:03:31.450 --> 00:03:34.120
 when we have it, we give the first the 

00:03:33.519 --> 00:03:35.860
 first option 

00:03:34.120 --> 00:03:38.920
 the one with the green button and we wait for 

00:03:35.860 --> 00:03:41.019
 charge when it's loaded so 

00:03:38.920 --> 00:03:43.180
 We give below to read next and now 

00:03:41.019 --> 00:03:45.069
 to 6 more we keep it we put a 

00:03:43.180 --> 00:03:46.959
 name and we keep it in svg very 

00:03:45.069 --> 00:03:47.980
 important when we already have it there 

00:03:46.959 --> 00:03:49.810
 key is seen that has been saved 

00:03:47.980 --> 00:03:51.700
 we have to open the browser 

00:03:49.810 --> 00:03:53.769
 internet explorer is very important 

00:03:51.700 --> 00:03:55.000
 open that denied the browser then 

00:03:53.769 --> 00:03:57.610
 we are already the image here and now you aus 

00:03:55.000 --> 00:03:59.379
 right button to the image and we're going to 

00:03:57.610 --> 00:04:01.750
 see source code and then when 

00:03:59.379 --> 00:04:04.239
 come out this html we copy the first putt 

00:04:01.750 --> 00:04:07.120
 field to the bottom of the whole is very 

00:04:04.239 --> 00:04:09.040
 important to host the first putt field and 

00:04:07.120 --> 00:04:10.920
 now here do not catch the last thing that will be 

00:04:09.040 --> 00:04:13.239
 the axis is very important not 

00:04:10.920 --> 00:04:15.370
 select it then we already copy it the 

00:04:13.239 --> 00:04:17.079
 I love the right button to copy and buy 

00:04:15.370 --> 00:04:19.269
 the html now we go to the page that the 

00:04:17.079 --> 00:04:22.600
 will leave in the description to create the 

00:04:19.269 --> 00:04:24.580
 emblems in gta 5 and then here not 

00:04:22.600 --> 00:04:26.770
 we can without background is very important if 

00:04:24.580 --> 00:04:28.449
 you have images without a background 

00:04:26.770 --> 00:04:30.870
 let's read the right button and print to 

00:04:28.449 --> 00:04:34.210
 element and then here where does the 

00:04:30.870 --> 00:04:37.150
 512 since we selected it we have already button 

00:04:34.210 --> 00:04:38.800
 right edit 7 ml and when we are 

00:04:37.150 --> 00:04:42.060
 here we will have to look at the sign of 

00:04:38.800 --> 00:04:45.160
 major and minor where is the cvg 

00:04:42.060 --> 00:04:47.200
 and then here we give control more v 

00:04:45.160 --> 00:04:49.780
 it's very important to do it right there 

00:04:47.200 --> 00:04:51.820
 with the previous steps that I showed you and 

00:04:49.780 --> 00:04:54.100
 we click on the page and we are already 

00:04:51.820 --> 00:04:56.110
 is now saved to save what 

00:04:54.100 --> 00:04:57.550
 we stay forever what we have 

00:04:56.110 --> 00:04:59.590
 what to do is give it where it says save 

00:04:57.550 --> 00:05:01.300
 there and we keep it if you see that load 

00:04:59.590 --> 00:05:03.160
 takes a long time to oppose the end that has 

00:05:01.300 --> 00:05:05.050
 saved because we're going to cancel and what 

00:05:03.160 --> 00:05:07.660
 we return to save to side we will see that to 

00:05:05.050 --> 00:05:09.070
 it takes me normally it should not happen 

00:05:07.660 --> 00:05:11.140
 this what happens that having the past 

00:05:09.070 --> 00:05:12.550
 and then we tried it with other emblems 

00:05:11.140 --> 00:05:14.410
 later on and at the end yes that I 

00:05:12.550 --> 00:05:15.730
 they kept the first one so that's going to 

00:05:14.410 --> 00:05:17.380
 depend on the page if it is ok or 

00:05:15.730 --> 00:05:19.960
 It is wrong now see that him 

00:05:17.380 --> 00:05:22.120
 cancel save does not let me now 

00:05:19.960 --> 00:05:24.250
 Here I am going to save him and he leaves me there 

00:05:22.120 --> 00:05:26.020
 seen that it has been saved here in the 

00:05:24.250 --> 00:05:27.820
 image now to publish it because it 

00:05:26.020 --> 00:05:30.100
 we give the same thing we are going to publish it 

00:05:27.820 --> 00:05:31.750
 we publish in our screen and we're going to 

00:05:30.100 --> 00:05:33.940
 publish if you see that you do not load another 

00:05:31.750 --> 00:05:36.460
 once we give the same to cancel and so 

00:05:33.940 --> 00:05:38.410
 all the time until they leave us is very 

00:05:36.460 --> 00:05:39.880
 important a tradition of this wolf is 

00:05:38.410 --> 00:05:42.010
 question of going testing until we 

00:05:39.880 --> 00:05:43.630
 leave and we see that he does not let me go back to 

00:05:42.010 --> 00:05:45.990
 do and here this time it does leave me what 

00:05:43.630 --> 00:05:48.840
 We will see what problem has already been 

00:05:45.990 --> 00:05:51.100
 publish and 

00:05:48.840 --> 00:05:53.320
 and so, well, this has been all 

00:05:51.100 --> 00:05:55.300
 I hope you liked the video if it is 

00:05:53.320 --> 00:05:56.980
 so do not forget let me to light and if 

00:05:55.300 --> 00:05:58.930
