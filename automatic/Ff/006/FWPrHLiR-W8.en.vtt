00:00:21.260 --> 00:00:21.270 
of the parts some of the like glue and

00:00:21.270 --> 00:00:23.380 
of the parts some of the like glue and
stuff<00:00:21.630> like<00:00:21.720> that<00:00:21.900> I<00:00:21.930> had<00:00:22.230> to<00:00:22.380> buy<00:00:22.529> but<00:00:22.830> um

00:00:28.040 --> 00:00:28.050 
I'll go over all the parts and why I did

00:00:28.050 --> 00:00:31.820 
I'll go over all the parts and why I did
this<00:00:28.260> and<00:00:28.529> etc<00:00:29.250> etc<00:00:29.460> in<00:00:30.150> the<00:00:30.359> next<00:00:30.689> video<00:00:30.929> which

how I made it and everything like that
so<00:00:36.710> watch<00:00:37.710> for<00:00:37.739> that<00:00:37.920> video<00:00:38.219> in<00:00:38.340> about<00:00:38.489> a<00:00:38.520> week

00:00:38.690 --> 00:00:38.700 
so watch for that video in about a week

00:00:38.700 --> 00:00:41.690 
so watch for that video in about a week
and<00:00:39.050> so<00:00:40.050> this<00:00:40.350> video<00:00:40.500> I'm<00:00:40.680> just<00:00:40.739> gonna<00:00:40.920> do<00:00:41.670> a

00:00:41.690 --> 00:00:41.700 
and so this video I'm just gonna do a

00:00:41.700 --> 00:00:45.260 
and so this video I'm just gonna do a
nice<00:00:41.910> run<00:00:42.149> of<00:00:42.270> it<00:00:42.390> so<00:00:43.610> it<00:00:44.610> will<00:00:44.700> actually<00:00:45.090> run

00:00:45.260 --> 00:00:45.270 
nice run of it so it will actually run

00:00:45.270 --> 00:00:48.319 
nice run of it so it will actually run
off<00:00:45.450> of<00:00:45.739> just<00:00:46.739> your<00:00:46.860> breath<00:00:47.129> if<00:00:47.640> you<00:00:47.879> um<00:00:48.120> I

00:00:48.319 --> 00:00:48.329 
off of just your breath if you um I

00:00:48.329 --> 00:00:49.940 
off of just your breath if you um I
don't<00:00:48.840> know<00:00:48.930> if<00:00:49.020> I<00:00:49.079> can<00:00:49.230> do<00:00:49.320> I<00:00:49.500> can't<00:00:49.770> do<00:00:49.860> this

00:00:49.940 --> 00:00:49.950 
don't know if I can do I can't do this

00:00:49.950 --> 00:00:51.350 
don't know if I can do I can't do this
with<00:00:50.129> one<00:00:50.280> hand<00:00:50.309> though<00:00:50.610> because<00:00:50.789> I<00:00:51.090> have<00:00:51.149> to

00:00:51.350 --> 00:00:51.360 
with one hand though because I have to

00:00:51.360 --> 00:00:53.930 
with one hand though because I have to
start<00:00:51.539> the<00:00:51.660> flywheel<00:00:51.809> now<00:00:52.620> but<00:00:52.920> if<00:00:53.550> you<00:00:53.730> hope

00:00:53.930 --> 00:00:53.940 
start the flywheel now but if you hope

00:00:53.940 --> 00:00:55.819 
start the flywheel now but if you hope
if<00:00:54.180> you<00:00:54.360> just<00:00:54.539> blow<00:00:54.719> on<00:00:54.750> here<00:00:55.110> it<00:00:55.260> will<00:00:55.440> run

00:00:55.819 --> 00:00:55.829 
if you just blow on here it will run

00:00:55.829 --> 00:00:57.560 
if you just blow on here it will run
real<00:00:56.100> slowly<00:00:56.370> but<00:00:56.969> I'm<00:00:57.059> going<00:00:57.210> to<00:00:57.239> run<00:00:57.390> it<00:00:57.480> off

00:00:57.560 --> 00:00:57.570 
real slowly but I'm going to run it off

00:00:57.570 --> 00:01:00.619 
real slowly but I'm going to run it off
a<00:00:57.600> vacuum<00:00:58.789> because<00:00:59.789> I<00:00:59.820> don't<00:01:00.000> have<00:01:00.120> a<00:01:00.180> boiler

00:01:00.619 --> 00:01:00.629 
a vacuum because I don't have a boiler

00:01:00.629 --> 00:01:03.709 
a vacuum because I don't have a boiler
yet<00:01:01.620> so<00:01:02.520> I'm<00:01:02.730> hoping<00:01:03.120> to<00:01:03.239> make<00:01:03.329> a<00:01:03.390> boiler

00:01:03.709 --> 00:01:03.719 
yet so I'm hoping to make a boiler

00:01:03.719 --> 00:01:07.670 
yet so I'm hoping to make a boiler
sometime<00:01:04.140> so<00:01:05.100> yeah<00:01:05.760> this<00:01:06.659> is<00:01:06.720> my<00:01:06.869> valve<00:01:07.200> my

00:01:07.670 --> 00:01:07.680 
sometime so yeah this is my valve my

00:01:07.680 --> 00:01:10.609 
sometime so yeah this is my valve my
piston<00:01:08.130> and<00:01:08.340> cylinder<00:01:08.720> my<00:01:09.720> flywheel<00:01:10.170> there's

00:01:10.609 --> 00:01:10.619 
piston and cylinder my flywheel there's

00:01:10.619 --> 00:01:16.370 
piston and cylinder my flywheel there's
my<00:01:12.200> my<00:01:13.850> cam<00:01:14.850> well<00:01:15.450> that's<00:01:15.750> not<00:01:15.900> the<00:01:15.990> cam<00:01:16.170> that's

00:01:16.370 --> 00:01:16.380 
my my cam well that's not the cam that's

00:01:16.380 --> 00:01:18.679 
my my cam well that's not the cam that's
the<00:01:16.530> crank<00:01:16.770> and<00:01:17.400> here's<00:01:17.640> my<00:01:17.790> cam<00:01:18.090> for<00:01:18.540> the

00:01:18.679 --> 00:01:18.689 
the crank and here's my cam for the

00:01:18.689 --> 00:01:22.820 
the crank and here's my cam for the
valve<00:01:19.080> so<00:01:19.950> yeah<00:01:20.869> so<00:01:21.869> let's<00:01:22.140> hook<00:01:22.350> it<00:01:22.439> up<00:01:22.560> to<00:01:22.740> the

00:01:22.820 --> 00:01:22.830 
valve so yeah so let's hook it up to the

00:01:22.830 --> 00:01:27.170 
valve so yeah so let's hook it up to the
vacuum<00:01:23.280> pump<00:01:23.430> and<00:01:25.159> here<00:01:26.159> we<00:01:26.280> go<00:01:26.460> and<00:01:26.790> I'm<00:01:27.150> just

00:01:27.170 --> 00:01:27.180 
vacuum pump and here we go and I'm just

00:01:27.180 --> 00:01:29.960 
vacuum pump and here we go and I'm just
using<00:01:27.450> a<00:01:28.189> refrigerator<00:01:29.189> compressor<00:01:29.549> and<00:01:29.939> I

00:01:29.960 --> 00:01:29.970 
using a refrigerator compressor and I

00:01:29.970 --> 00:01:32.149 
using a refrigerator compressor and I
have<00:01:30.119> it<00:01:30.210> on<00:01:30.270> vacuum<00:01:30.720> because<00:01:31.049> if<00:01:31.650> I<00:01:31.799> did<00:01:32.040> the

00:01:32.149 --> 00:01:32.159 
have it on vacuum because if I did the

00:01:32.159 --> 00:01:34.850 
have it on vacuum because if I did the
pressure<00:01:32.460> it<00:01:33.210> would<00:01:33.479> um<00:01:33.689> spit<00:01:34.380> all<00:01:34.530> kinds<00:01:34.799> of

00:01:34.850 --> 00:01:34.860 
pressure it would um spit all kinds of

00:01:34.860 --> 00:01:36.859 
pressure it would um spit all kinds of
oil<00:01:35.189> way<00:01:35.310> into<00:01:35.520> the<00:01:35.640> engine<00:01:35.970> it<00:01:36.060> just<00:01:36.509> smells

00:01:36.859 --> 00:01:36.869 
oil way into the engine it just smells

00:01:36.869 --> 00:01:39.830 
oil way into the engine it just smells
really<00:01:37.140> bad<00:01:37.259> the<00:01:37.590> oil<00:01:37.799> so<00:01:38.390> there<00:01:39.390> it<00:01:39.540> is<00:01:39.630> it's

00:01:39.830 --> 00:01:39.840 
really bad the oil so there it is it's

00:01:39.840 --> 00:01:46.580 
really bad the oil so there it is it's
running<00:01:41.390> pretty<00:01:42.390> well<00:01:44.780> it's<00:01:45.780> got<00:01:45.960> a<00:01:45.990> fair

00:01:46.580 --> 00:01:46.590 
running pretty well it's got a fair

00:01:46.590 --> 00:01:55.290 
running pretty well it's got a fair
amount<00:01:46.770> of<00:01:47.009> power

00:01:55.290 --> 00:01:55.300 

00:01:55.300 --> 00:01:58.270 

and<00:01:56.300> if<00:01:56.480> you<00:01:56.600> connect<00:01:57.470> this<00:01:57.620> up<00:01:57.680> to<00:01:57.980> the<00:01:58.100> other

00:01:58.270 --> 00:01:58.280 
and if you connect this up to the other

00:01:58.280 --> 00:02:01.000 
and if you connect this up to the other
port<00:01:58.700> it<00:01:59.420> will<00:01:59.600> reverse<00:01:59.960> the<00:02:00.170> engine<00:02:00.500> while

00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:01.010 
port it will reverse the engine while

00:02:01.010 --> 00:02:14.620 
port it will reverse the engine while
it's<00:02:01.130> going<00:02:01.340> opposite<00:02:01.700> direction<00:02:12.850> so<00:02:13.850> yeah<00:02:13.970> it

00:02:14.620 --> 00:02:14.630 
it's going opposite direction so yeah it

00:02:14.630 --> 00:02:17.380 
it's going opposite direction so yeah it
runs<00:02:14.780> off<00:02:14.959> pressure<00:02:15.200> just<00:02:15.530> as<00:02:15.680> well<00:02:15.920> I<00:02:16.820> have

00:02:17.380 --> 00:02:17.390 
runs off pressure just as well I have

00:02:17.390 --> 00:02:18.670 
runs off pressure just as well I have
the<00:02:17.510> gauge<00:02:17.690> on<00:02:17.900> here<00:02:18.140> and<00:02:18.290> it's<00:02:18.470> running

00:02:18.670 --> 00:02:18.680 
the gauge on here and it's running

00:02:18.680 --> 00:02:22.449 
the gauge on here and it's running
probably<00:02:19.280> about<00:02:20.650> 230<00:02:21.650> millimeters<00:02:22.310> of

00:02:22.449 --> 00:02:22.459 
probably about 230 millimeters of

00:02:22.459 --> 00:02:26.530 
probably about 230 millimeters of
mercury<00:02:22.489> so<00:02:24.430> yeah<00:02:25.430> so<00:02:25.910> it's<00:02:25.940> probably<00:02:26.420> about

00:02:26.530 --> 00:02:26.540 
mercury so yeah so it's probably about

00:02:26.540 --> 00:02:28.590 
mercury so yeah so it's probably about
five<00:02:26.900> psi<00:02:27.440> approximately<00:02:28.310> because

00:02:28.590 --> 00:02:28.600 
five psi approximately because

00:02:28.600 --> 00:02:31.720 
five psi approximately because
technically<00:02:29.600> if<00:02:30.230> you're<00:02:30.470> counting<00:02:30.709> at<00:02:31.370> weld

00:02:31.720 --> 00:02:31.730 
technically if you're counting at weld

00:02:31.730 --> 00:02:33.910 
technically if you're counting at weld
that<00:02:31.940> because<00:02:32.540> it's<00:02:32.660> pulling<00:02:33.230> a<00:02:33.290> vacuum<00:02:33.440> it's

00:02:33.910 --> 00:02:33.920 
that because it's pulling a vacuum it's

00:02:33.920 --> 00:02:36.810 
that because it's pulling a vacuum it's
actually<00:02:34.760> running<00:02:34.940> off<00:02:35.120> of<00:02:35.150> about<00:02:35.989> five<00:02:36.230> psi

00:02:36.810 --> 00:02:36.820 
actually running off of about five psi

00:02:36.820 --> 00:02:42.430 
actually running off of about five psi
atmosphere<00:02:37.820> so<00:02:38.860> yeah<00:02:39.860> that<00:02:40.640> is<00:02:40.790> my<00:02:41.239> new<00:02:42.080> steam

00:02:42.430 --> 00:02:42.440 
atmosphere so yeah that is my new steam

00:02:42.440 --> 00:03:24.360 
atmosphere so yeah that is my new steam
engine<00:02:42.739> running<00:02:54.970> pretty<00:02:55.970> quiet<00:02:56.239> actually

00:03:24.360 --> 00:03:24.370 

00:03:24.370 --> 00:03:32.050 

on<00:03:25.370> the<00:03:25.490> vacuum<00:03:25.880> pump<00:03:26.030> ah<00:03:30.670> alright<00:03:31.670> so<00:03:31.910> that<00:03:32.030> is

00:03:32.050 --> 00:03:32.060 
on the vacuum pump ah alright so that is

00:03:32.060 --> 00:03:34.180 
on the vacuum pump ah alright so that is
my<00:03:32.210> steam<00:03:32.780> engine<00:03:33.140> first-ever<00:03:33.560> steam<00:03:33.890> engine

00:03:34.180 --> 00:03:34.190 
my steam engine first-ever steam engine

00:03:34.190 --> 00:03:37.270 
my steam engine first-ever steam engine
oh<00:03:34.340> one<00:03:35.060> more<00:03:35.210> thing<00:03:35.270> don't<00:03:36.200> forget<00:03:36.260> to<00:03:36.470> stay
