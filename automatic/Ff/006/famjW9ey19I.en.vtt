 memories of having a good time and 

00:01:22.930 --> 00:01:27.270

00:01:33.650 --> 00:01:37.900

00:01:45.710 --> 00:01:49.360
 favorite crack we have ball point 

00:01:55.630 --> 00:02:00.630
 do not put more this then if there is no 

00:01:57.280 --> 00:02:00.630
 problem is worth 

00:02:03.100 --> 00:02:08.400
 you are 

00:02:04.980 --> 00:02:10.640
 sensitive what is it that makes you thrill 

00:02:08.400 --> 00:02:10.640
 themes 

00:02:14.520 --> 00:02:18.230
 I am not sensitive but sometimes 

00:02:18.430 --> 00:02:24.680
 maybe life and everything 

00:02:22.640 --> 00:02:28.540
 what I have gone through has led me to be 

00:02:24.680 --> 00:02:30.959
 a person who hides 

00:02:28.540 --> 00:02:33.370
 that sensitivity but if I'm sensitive 

00:02:30.959 --> 00:02:36.180
 you have to hide the sensitivity for 

00:02:33.370 --> 00:02:36.180
 manage for life 

00:02:40.280 --> 00:02:45.380
 well 

00:02:41.810 --> 00:02:47.900
 it also rained in the weird world that to 

00:02:45.380 --> 00:02:49.780
 Sometimes it is not, it is not like the reality that 

00:02:47.900 --> 00:02:52.010
 lives the rest of the people then 

00:02:49.780 --> 00:02:54.349
 you always have to have a pretty face 

00:02:52.010 --> 00:02:56.900
 a smile seems that everything is fine 

00:02:54.349 --> 00:03:00.220
 but we are human beings just like the 

00:02:56.900 --> 00:03:04.390
 rest one gets tired of smiling so much 

00:03:00.220 --> 00:03:04.390
 although I do not want many times 

00:03:06.010 --> 00:03:11.819
 and there are times when things do not 

00:03:08.650 --> 00:03:15.510
 they are fine and do not feel like 

00:03:11.819 --> 00:03:17.670
 smile or that you do not have desire but good 

00:03:15.510 --> 00:03:19.499
 the people are not to blame and the children 

00:03:17.670 --> 00:03:21.220
 especially children when when 

00:03:19.499 --> 00:03:22.840
 they approach 

00:03:21.220 --> 00:03:25.450
 they are not not to blame for what is 

00:03:22.840 --> 00:03:27.390
 living then usually the 

00:03:25.450 --> 00:03:29.700
 footballers try to 

00:03:27.390 --> 00:03:34.130
 to get the most out of people and 

00:03:29.700 --> 00:03:34.130
 with especially with youth
