adapted<00:00:08.770> to<00:00:08.950> the<00:00:09.250> climate<00:00:09.700> that<00:00:09.730> we<00:00:09.940> have<00:00:10.090> here

00:00:10.610 --> 00:00:10.620 
adapted to the climate that we have here

00:00:10.620 --> 00:00:13.350 
adapted to the climate that we have here
one<00:00:11.620> of<00:00:11.650> the<00:00:11.769> big<00:00:11.920> constraints<00:00:12.459> is<00:00:12.580> that<00:00:12.790> the

00:00:13.350 --> 00:00:13.360 
one of the big constraints is that the

00:00:13.360 --> 00:00:16.019 
one of the big constraints is that the
native<00:00:13.599> grasses<00:00:14.219> if<00:00:15.219> you<00:00:15.370> look<00:00:15.519> at<00:00:15.639> the<00:00:15.820> cool

00:00:16.019 --> 00:00:16.029 
native grasses if you look at the cool

00:00:16.029 --> 00:00:17.970 
native grasses if you look at the cool
season<00:00:16.209> grasses<00:00:16.509> they're<00:00:16.930> very<00:00:17.140> pliable<00:00:17.529> and

00:00:17.970 --> 00:00:17.980 
season grasses they're very pliable and

00:00:17.980 --> 00:00:21.330 
season grasses they're very pliable and
palatable<00:00:18.430> the<00:00:19.419> native<00:00:19.660> grasses<00:00:19.930> are<00:00:20.340> stiffer

00:00:21.330 --> 00:00:21.340 
palatable the native grasses are stiffer

00:00:21.340 --> 00:00:26.490 
palatable the native grasses are stiffer
and<00:00:22.210> that's<00:00:22.869> because<00:00:23.109> they<00:00:24.240> because<00:00:25.500> nitrogen

00:00:26.490 --> 00:00:26.500 
and that's because they because nitrogen

00:00:26.500 --> 00:00:29.400 
and that's because they because nitrogen
and<00:00:26.710> moisture<00:00:27.250> were<00:00:27.490> so<00:00:28.210> limited<00:00:28.410> they

00:00:29.400 --> 00:00:29.410 
and moisture were so limited they

00:00:29.410 --> 00:00:31.019 
and moisture were so limited they
actually<00:00:29.740> build<00:00:30.010> structures<00:00:30.759> in<00:00:30.910> their

00:00:31.019 --> 00:00:31.029 
actually build structures in their

00:00:31.029 --> 00:00:32.220 
actually build structures in their
leaves<00:00:31.240> they<00:00:31.599> have<00:00:31.689> a<00:00:31.750> different<00:00:32.019> kind<00:00:32.169> of

00:00:32.220 --> 00:00:32.230 
leaves they have a different kind of

00:00:32.230 --> 00:00:34.290 
leaves they have a different kind of
photosynthesis<00:00:32.980> than<00:00:33.250> our<00:00:33.640> typical<00:00:33.850> forage

00:00:34.290 --> 00:00:34.300 
photosynthesis than our typical forage

00:00:34.300 --> 00:00:36.390 
photosynthesis than our typical forage
grasses<00:00:34.540> so<00:00:35.260> there's<00:00:35.440> a<00:00:35.710> lot<00:00:35.949> of<00:00:36.070> fiber<00:00:36.280> in

00:00:36.390 --> 00:00:36.400 
grasses so there's a lot of fiber in

00:00:36.400 --> 00:00:39.660 
grasses so there's a lot of fiber in
this<00:00:36.640> and<00:00:36.910> even<00:00:37.840> actually<00:00:38.290> less<00:00:38.670> fewer

00:00:39.660 --> 00:00:39.670 
this and even actually less fewer

00:00:39.670 --> 00:00:42.510 
this and even actually less fewer
nitrogen<00:00:40.660> rich<00:00:40.780> enzymes<00:00:41.350> for<00:00:41.710> photosynthesis

00:00:42.510 --> 00:00:42.520 
nitrogen rich enzymes for photosynthesis

00:00:42.520 --> 00:00:44.940 
nitrogen rich enzymes for photosynthesis
so<00:00:42.850> our<00:00:43.690> native<00:00:43.960> grasses<00:00:44.170> are<00:00:44.500> just<00:00:44.710> a<00:00:44.800> lot

00:00:44.940 --> 00:00:44.950 
so our native grasses are just a lot

00:00:44.950 --> 00:00:47.279 
so our native grasses are just a lot
more<00:00:45.270> efficient<00:00:46.270> in<00:00:46.450> terms<00:00:46.480> of<00:00:46.840> using<00:00:47.020> the

00:00:47.279 --> 00:00:47.289 
more efficient in terms of using the

00:00:47.289 --> 00:00:49.080 
more efficient in terms of using the
resources<00:00:47.770> here<00:00:48.039> but<00:00:48.280> that<00:00:48.700> doesn't<00:00:49.030> make

00:00:49.080 --> 00:00:49.090 
resources here but that doesn't make

00:00:49.090 --> 00:00:52.350 
resources here but that doesn't make
them<00:00:49.239> so<00:00:49.449> good<00:00:49.600> for<00:00:49.920> cattle<00:00:50.920> forage<00:00:51.280> so<00:00:52.210> the

00:00:52.350 --> 00:00:52.360 
them so good for cattle forage so the

00:00:52.360 --> 00:00:54.270 
them so good for cattle forage so the
idea<00:00:52.840> of<00:00:52.899> what<00:00:53.170> we<00:00:53.230> wanted<00:00:53.469> to<00:00:53.530> try<00:00:53.739> here<00:00:54.010> is

00:00:54.270 --> 00:00:54.280 
idea of what we wanted to try here is

00:00:54.280 --> 00:00:56.700 
idea of what we wanted to try here is
introducing<00:00:55.059> native<00:00:55.899> leggings<00:00:56.320> since<00:00:56.559> these

00:00:56.700 --> 00:00:56.710 
introducing native leggings since these

00:00:56.710 --> 00:00:59.369 
introducing native leggings since these
systems<00:00:57.190> so<00:00:57.719> looking<00:00:58.719> at<00:00:58.840> something<00:00:59.140> that's

00:00:59.369 --> 00:00:59.379 
systems so looking at something that's

00:00:59.379 --> 00:01:01.650 
systems so looking at something that's
complementary<00:01:00.309> to<00:01:00.550> the<00:01:00.730> to<00:01:01.180> the<00:01:01.300> prairies<00:01:01.629> to

00:01:01.650 --> 00:01:01.660 
complementary to the to the prairies to

00:01:01.660 --> 00:01:04.799 
complementary to the to the prairies to
boost<00:01:02.309> nitrogen<00:01:03.309> versus<00:01:03.850> adding<00:01:04.360> fertilizer

00:01:04.799 --> 00:01:04.809 
boost nitrogen versus adding fertilizer

00:01:04.809 --> 00:01:07.859 
boost nitrogen versus adding fertilizer
or<00:01:05.500> even<00:01:06.100> trying<00:01:06.340> to<00:01:06.430> add<00:01:06.580> typical<00:01:07.570> forage

00:01:07.859 --> 00:01:07.869 
or even trying to add typical forage

00:01:07.869 --> 00:01:09.660 
or even trying to add typical forage
legumes<00:01:08.080> which<00:01:08.530> just<00:01:09.099> with<00:01:09.250> the<00:01:09.369> way<00:01:09.490> their

00:01:09.660 --> 00:01:09.670 
legumes which just with the way their

00:01:09.670 --> 00:01:11.490 
legumes which just with the way their
growing<00:01:09.910> season<00:01:10.030> is<00:01:10.539> it<00:01:10.990> doesn't<00:01:11.289> coincide

00:01:11.490 --> 00:01:11.500 
growing season is it doesn't coincide

00:01:11.500 --> 00:01:14.309 
growing season is it doesn't coincide
very<00:01:12.009> well<00:01:12.220> with<00:01:12.399> what<00:01:12.580> the<00:01:12.869> prairies<00:01:13.869> do<00:01:14.080> so

00:01:14.309 --> 00:01:14.319 
very well with what the prairies do so

00:01:14.319 --> 00:01:16.800 
very well with what the prairies do so
if<00:01:14.380> you<00:01:14.789> seated<00:01:15.789> in<00:01:15.910> a<00:01:15.970> lot<00:01:16.119> of<00:01:16.149> red<00:01:16.360> clover<00:01:16.660> you

00:01:16.800 --> 00:01:16.810 
if you seated in a lot of red clover you

00:01:16.810 --> 00:01:18.809 
if you seated in a lot of red clover you
could<00:01:17.110> kind<00:01:17.770> of<00:01:17.890> shade<00:01:18.069> out<00:01:18.250> a<00:01:18.280> lot<00:01:18.610> of<00:01:18.729> the

00:01:18.809 --> 00:01:18.819 
could kind of shade out a lot of the

00:01:18.819 --> 00:01:20.249 
could kind of shade out a lot of the
things<00:01:19.030> that<00:01:19.119> you<00:01:19.330> really<00:01:19.780> wanted<00:01:20.050> in<00:01:20.170> the

00:01:20.249 --> 00:01:20.259 
things that you really wanted in the

00:01:20.259 --> 00:01:23.760 
things that you really wanted in the
Prairie<00:01:20.470> in<00:01:20.950> the<00:01:21.130> long<00:01:21.310> run<00:01:21.520> so<00:01:22.479> we<00:01:23.440> looked<00:01:23.619> at

00:01:23.760 --> 00:01:23.770 
Prairie in the long run so we looked at

00:01:23.770 --> 00:01:25.980 
Prairie in the long run so we looked at
primarily<00:01:24.580> two<00:01:25.060> things<00:01:25.330> we<00:01:25.599> looked<00:01:25.780> at<00:01:25.899> this

00:01:25.980 --> 00:01:25.990 
primarily two things we looked at this

00:01:25.990 --> 00:01:28.949 
primarily two things we looked at this
across<00:01:26.319> the<00:01:26.470> diversity<00:01:26.890> gradient<00:01:27.310> so<00:01:27.840> in<00:01:28.840> our

00:01:28.949 --> 00:01:28.959 
across the diversity gradient so in our

00:01:28.959 --> 00:01:31.469 
across the diversity gradient so in our
switchgrass<00:01:29.649> monocultures<00:01:30.490> our<00:01:31.149> lowest

00:01:31.469 --> 00:01:31.479 
switchgrass monocultures our lowest

00:01:31.479 --> 00:01:33.150 
switchgrass monocultures our lowest
diversity<00:01:31.929> just<00:01:32.140> one<00:01:32.289> native<00:01:32.440> species<00:01:32.800> and

00:01:33.150 --> 00:01:33.160 
diversity just one native species and

00:01:33.160 --> 00:01:36.089 
diversity just one native species and
then<00:01:34.050> successively<00:01:35.050> more<00:01:35.140> diverse<00:01:35.560> prairies

00:01:36.089 --> 00:01:36.099 
then successively more diverse prairies

00:01:36.099 --> 00:01:38.570 
then successively more diverse prairies
with<00:01:36.369> more<00:01:37.149> native<00:01:37.420> species<00:01:37.660> incorporated

00:01:38.570 --> 00:01:38.580 
with more native species incorporated

00:01:38.580 --> 00:01:41.339 
with more native species incorporated
and<00:01:39.580> what<00:01:39.759> we<00:01:39.849> then<00:01:40.300> we<00:01:40.420> looked<00:01:40.599> at<00:01:40.720> management

00:01:41.339 --> 00:01:41.349 
and what we then we looked at management

00:01:41.349 --> 00:01:43.910 
and what we then we looked at management
so<00:01:41.500> things<00:01:41.739> that<00:01:41.920> we<00:01:42.009> could<00:01:42.130> do<00:01:42.250> to<00:01:42.459> limit<00:01:43.060> the

00:01:43.910 --> 00:01:43.920 
so things that we could do to limit the

00:01:43.920 --> 00:01:46.080 
so things that we could do to limit the
competition<00:01:44.920> for<00:01:45.130> those<00:01:45.250> legumes<00:01:45.700> two<00:01:45.849> things

00:01:46.080 --> 00:01:46.090 
competition for those legumes two things

00:01:46.090 --> 00:01:49.080 
competition for those legumes two things
so<00:01:46.330> we<00:01:46.810> looked<00:01:46.989> at<00:01:47.110> rotational<00:01:47.890> stocking<00:01:48.369> with

00:01:49.080 --> 00:01:49.090 
so we looked at rotational stocking with

00:01:49.090 --> 00:01:52.380 
so we looked at rotational stocking with
cattle<00:01:49.560> bringing<00:01:50.560> in<00:01:50.819> janet's<00:01:51.819> Holstein

00:01:52.380 --> 00:01:52.390 
cattle bringing in janet's Holstein

00:01:52.390 --> 00:01:55.109 
cattle bringing in janet's Holstein
heifers<00:01:52.420> to<00:01:52.989> graze<00:01:53.200> periodically<00:01:53.770> and<00:01:54.119> open

00:01:55.109 --> 00:01:55.119 
heifers to graze periodically and open

00:01:55.119 --> 00:01:56.999 
heifers to graze periodically and open
up<00:01:55.179> the<00:01:55.330> canopy<00:01:55.599> and<00:01:56.020> let<00:01:56.440> more<00:01:56.560> light<00:01:56.619> down<00:01:56.830> to

00:01:56.999 --> 00:01:57.009 
up the canopy and let more light down to

00:01:57.009 --> 00:01:59.339 
up the canopy and let more light down to
the<00:01:57.160> soil<00:01:57.369> and<00:01:57.640> then<00:01:58.450> we<00:01:58.569> also<00:01:58.690> compared<00:01:59.170> that

00:01:59.339 --> 00:01:59.349 
the soil and then we also compared that

00:01:59.349 --> 00:02:01.740 
the soil and then we also compared that
to<00:01:59.530> mowing<00:01:59.890> which<00:02:00.220> is<00:02:00.399> a<00:02:00.729> tool<00:02:01.030> that<00:02:01.119> most

00:02:01.740 --> 00:02:01.750 
to mowing which is a tool that most

00:02:01.750 --> 00:02:04.710 
to mowing which is a tool that most
farmers<00:02:02.140> could<00:02:02.410> do<00:02:02.560> and<00:02:02.910> many<00:02:03.910> conservation

00:02:04.710 --> 00:02:04.720 
farmers could do and many conservation

00:02:04.720 --> 00:02:07.289 
farmers could do and many conservation
organizations<00:02:05.560> already<00:02:05.770> do<00:02:06.039> some

00:02:07.289 --> 00:02:07.299 
organizations already do some

00:02:07.299 --> 00:02:09.779 
organizations already do some
so<00:02:07.600> we<00:02:07.930> looked<00:02:08.110> at<00:02:08.229> diversity<00:02:09.099> and<00:02:09.429> the<00:02:09.519> tools

00:02:09.779 --> 00:02:09.789 
so we looked at diversity and the tools

00:02:09.789 --> 00:02:14.430 
so we looked at diversity and the tools
and<00:02:10.800> interceded<00:02:12.720> leggings<00:02:13.720> in<00:02:13.810> a<00:02:13.900> split<00:02:14.170> split

00:02:14.430 --> 00:02:14.440 
and interceded leggings in a split split

00:02:14.440 --> 00:02:17.430 
and interceded leggings in a split split
flat<00:02:14.680> design<00:02:15.069> and<00:02:16.170> unfortunately<00:02:17.170> after<00:02:17.260> two

00:02:17.430 --> 00:02:17.440 
flat design and unfortunately after two

00:02:17.440 --> 00:02:20.850 
flat design and unfortunately after two
years<00:02:17.739> we<00:02:18.040> basically<00:02:18.459> saw<00:02:19.019> zero<00:02:20.019> recruitment

00:02:20.850 --> 00:02:20.860 
years we basically saw zero recruitment

00:02:20.860 --> 00:02:22.740 
years we basically saw zero recruitment
of<00:02:20.950> leggings<00:02:21.310> there<00:02:21.640> there<00:02:22.030> were<00:02:22.150> seedlings

00:02:22.740 --> 00:02:22.750 
of leggings there there were seedlings

00:02:22.750 --> 00:02:25.350 
of leggings there there were seedlings
here<00:02:22.959> and<00:02:23.080> there<00:02:23.230> but<00:02:23.530> from<00:02:24.340> a<00:02:24.489> biological<00:02:24.700> or

00:02:25.350 --> 00:02:25.360 
here and there but from a biological or

00:02:25.360 --> 00:02:28.559 
here and there but from a biological or
ecological<00:02:25.769> forage<00:02:26.769> aspect<00:02:27.220> those<00:02:27.569> those

00:02:28.559 --> 00:02:28.569 
ecological forage aspect those those

00:02:28.569 --> 00:02:31.920 
ecological forage aspect those those
legumes<00:02:29.019> aren't<00:02:29.470> really<00:02:30.250> a<00:02:30.280> major<00:02:30.930> component

00:02:31.920 --> 00:02:31.930 
legumes aren't really a major component

00:02:31.930 --> 00:02:35.009 
legumes aren't really a major component
of<00:02:31.989> the<00:02:32.140> system<00:02:32.349> so<00:02:33.269> future<00:02:34.269> research<00:02:34.810> I<00:02:34.989> think

00:02:35.009 --> 00:02:35.019 
of the system so future research I think

00:02:35.019 --> 00:02:38.520 
of the system so future research I think
would<00:02:35.260> have<00:02:35.410> to<00:02:35.440> drill<00:02:35.799> down<00:02:35.950> more<00:02:36.310> on<00:02:37.530> timing

00:02:38.520 --> 00:02:38.530 
would have to drill down more on timing

00:02:38.530 --> 00:02:39.960 
would have to drill down more on timing
of<00:02:38.650> interceding<00:02:39.190> or<00:02:39.340> different<00:02:39.670> kinds<00:02:39.910> of

00:02:39.960 --> 00:02:39.970 
of interceding or different kinds of

00:02:39.970 --> 00:02:42.270 
of interceding or different kinds of
management<00:02:40.299> to<00:02:40.660> really<00:02:40.870> try<00:02:41.079> to<00:02:41.280> complement

00:02:42.270 --> 00:02:42.280 
management to really try to complement

00:02:42.280 --> 00:02:44.460 
management to really try to complement
that<00:02:42.370> so<00:02:42.730> we<00:02:43.329> were<00:02:43.510> trying<00:02:44.049> to<00:02:44.110> do<00:02:44.200> a<00:02:44.230> broad

00:02:44.460 --> 00:02:44.470 
that so we were trying to do a broad

00:02:44.470 --> 00:02:48.180 
that so we were trying to do a broad
range<00:02:44.890> of<00:02:45.040> things<00:02:45.250> here<00:02:45.519> and<00:02:45.730> that<00:02:47.069> we<00:02:48.069> weren't

00:02:48.180 --> 00:02:48.190 
range of things here and that we weren't

00:02:48.190 --> 00:02:49.800 
range of things here and that we weren't
able<00:02:48.340> to<00:02:48.489> drill<00:02:48.700> down<00:02:48.819> as<00:02:49.000> well<00:02:49.180> on<00:02:49.329> that<00:02:49.480> but

00:02:49.800 --> 00:02:49.810 
able to drill down as well on that but

00:02:49.810 --> 00:02:53.900 
able to drill down as well on that but
we<00:02:50.349> were<00:02:50.500> still<00:02:50.769> able<00:02:50.860> to<00:02:52.290> quantify<00:02:53.290> the

00:02:53.900 --> 00:02:53.910 
we were still able to quantify the

00:02:53.910 --> 00:02:55.860 
we were still able to quantify the
forage<00:02:54.910> quality<00:02:55.060> in<00:02:55.480> these<00:02:55.630> different

00:02:55.860 --> 00:02:55.870 
forage quality in these different

00:02:55.870 --> 00:02:58.080 
forage quality in these different
diversity<00:02:56.500> levels<00:02:56.799> which<00:02:57.670> is<00:02:57.790> something<00:02:57.970> that

00:02:58.080 --> 00:02:58.090 
diversity levels which is something that

00:02:58.090 --> 00:02:59.670 
diversity levels which is something that
we<00:02:58.299> hadn't<00:02:58.660> been<00:02:58.720> able<00:02:58.840> to<00:02:58.959> do<00:02:59.140> for<00:02:59.380> this<00:02:59.440> part

00:02:59.670 --> 00:02:59.680 
we hadn't been able to do for this part

00:02:59.680 --> 00:03:02.220 
we hadn't been able to do for this part
of<00:02:59.739> the<00:02:59.829> country<00:03:00.180> previously<00:03:01.180> and<00:03:01.630> we<00:03:01.900> also

00:03:02.220 --> 00:03:02.230 
of the country previously and we also

00:03:02.230 --> 00:03:04.619 
of the country previously and we also
looked<00:03:02.530> at<00:03:02.650> the<00:03:02.920> effects<00:03:03.459> of<00:03:03.610> mowing<00:03:04.510> and

00:03:04.619 --> 00:03:04.629 
looked at the effects of mowing and

00:03:04.629 --> 00:03:07.440 
looked at the effects of mowing and
grazing<00:03:05.079> and<00:03:05.290> just<00:03:05.950> typical<00:03:06.700> more<00:03:06.910> hands-off

00:03:07.440 --> 00:03:07.450 
grazing and just typical more hands-off

00:03:07.450 --> 00:03:10.229 
grazing and just typical more hands-off
conservation<00:03:08.610> management<00:03:09.610> just<00:03:10.060> with

00:03:10.229 --> 00:03:10.239 
conservation management just with

00:03:10.239 --> 00:03:12.539 
conservation management just with
prescribed<00:03:10.690> fire<00:03:10.780> on<00:03:11.290> the<00:03:11.470> prairies<00:03:11.829> and<00:03:12.160> what

00:03:12.539 --> 00:03:12.549 
prescribed fire on the prairies and what

00:03:12.549 --> 00:03:14.819 
prescribed fire on the prairies and what
we<00:03:12.639> found<00:03:12.790> was<00:03:13.030> that<00:03:13.139> grazing<00:03:14.139> didn't<00:03:14.650> really

00:03:14.819 --> 00:03:14.829 
we found was that grazing didn't really

00:03:14.829 --> 00:03:16.319 
we found was that grazing didn't really
cause<00:03:15.040> a<00:03:15.069> big<00:03:15.370> change<00:03:15.819> in<00:03:16.000> the<00:03:16.090> plant

00:03:16.319 --> 00:03:16.329 
cause a big change in the plant

00:03:16.329 --> 00:03:20.000 
cause a big change in the plant
community<00:03:16.690> over<00:03:17.139> time<00:03:17.170> so<00:03:18.209> this<00:03:19.209> is

00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:20.010 
community over time so this is

00:03:20.010 --> 00:03:22.530 
community over time so this is
rotational<00:03:21.010> grazing<00:03:21.040> with<00:03:21.579> cattle<00:03:22.420> where

00:03:22.530 --> 00:03:22.540 
rotational grazing with cattle where

00:03:22.540 --> 00:03:23.759 
rotational grazing with cattle where
they're<00:03:22.690> allowed<00:03:22.840> to<00:03:22.900> be<00:03:23.109> selective<00:03:23.590> and

00:03:23.759 --> 00:03:23.769 
they're allowed to be selective and

00:03:23.769 --> 00:03:26.640 
they're allowed to be selective and
choose<00:03:24.340> grasses<00:03:24.819> and<00:03:24.940> legumes<00:03:25.560> actually<00:03:26.560> it

00:03:26.640 --> 00:03:26.650 
choose grasses and legumes actually it

00:03:26.650 --> 00:03:28.259 
choose grasses and legumes actually it
could<00:03:26.799> be<00:03:27.130> integrated<00:03:27.400> with<00:03:27.819> a<00:03:27.850> lot<00:03:28.030> of<00:03:28.060> our

00:03:28.259 --> 00:03:28.269 
could be integrated with a lot of our

00:03:28.269 --> 00:03:31.830 
could be integrated with a lot of our
existing<00:03:28.930> conservation<00:03:29.670> lands<00:03:30.670> so<00:03:31.630> we<00:03:31.690> could

00:03:31.830 --> 00:03:31.840 
existing conservation lands so we could

00:03:31.840 --> 00:03:34.199 
existing conservation lands so we could
do<00:03:31.989> more<00:03:32.560> more<00:03:32.920> adaptive<00:03:33.370> management

00:03:34.199 --> 00:03:34.209 
do more more adaptive management

00:03:34.209 --> 00:03:36.240 
do more more adaptive management
research<00:03:34.870> going<00:03:35.319> in<00:03:35.470> the<00:03:35.590> future<00:03:35.889> on<00:03:36.069> that<00:03:36.190> I

00:03:36.240 --> 00:03:36.250 
research going in the future on that I

00:03:36.250 --> 00:03:40.259 
research going in the future on that I
think<00:03:36.400> and<00:03:37.290> make<00:03:38.290> our<00:03:39.000> restoration<00:03:40.000> of<00:03:40.090> native

00:03:40.259 --> 00:03:40.269 
think and make our restoration of native

00:03:40.269 --> 00:03:43.800 
think and make our restoration of native
species<00:03:40.599> more<00:03:41.220> economic<00:03:42.220> for<00:03:42.970> all<00:03:43.090> landowners

00:03:43.800 --> 00:03:43.810 
species more economic for all landowners

00:03:43.810 --> 00:03:47.180 
species more economic for all landowners
of<00:03:43.840> all<00:03:44.049> stripes<00:03:44.519> the<00:03:45.519> mowing<00:03:45.880> really

00:03:47.180 --> 00:03:47.190 
of all stripes the mowing really

00:03:47.190 --> 00:03:49.740 
of all stripes the mowing really
depressed<00:03:48.190> a<00:03:48.370> lot<00:03:48.489> of<00:03:48.609> our<00:03:48.730> native<00:03:48.910> forbs<00:03:49.329> so

00:03:49.740 --> 00:03:49.750 
depressed a lot of our native forbs so

00:03:49.750 --> 00:03:51.850 
depressed a lot of our native forbs so
if<00:03:49.870> you<00:03:50.049> look<00:03:50.230> out<00:03:50.349> across<00:03:50.560> here

00:03:51.850 --> 00:03:51.860 
if you look out across here

00:03:51.860 --> 00:03:54.190 
if you look out across here
the<00:03:52.520> tall<00:03:52.850> species<00:03:53.270> with<00:03:53.480> brought<00:03:53.690> these<00:03:53.900> that

00:03:54.190 --> 00:03:54.200 
the tall species with brought these that

00:03:54.200 --> 00:03:57.450 
the tall species with brought these that
you<00:03:54.290> see<00:03:54.320> standing<00:03:54.620> up<00:03:54.920> those<00:03:55.580> are<00:03:56.260> native

00:03:57.450 --> 00:03:57.460 
you see standing up those are native

00:03:57.460 --> 00:04:00.280 
you see standing up those are native
sunflowers<00:03:58.460> we<00:03:59.330> see<00:03:59.480> some<00:03:59.690> there's<00:04:00.200> some

00:04:00.280 --> 00:04:00.290 
sunflowers we see some there's some

00:04:00.290 --> 00:04:01.270 
sunflowers we see some there's some
yellow<00:04:00.500> coneflower

00:04:01.270 --> 00:04:01.280 
yellow coneflower

00:04:01.280 --> 00:04:04.600 
yellow coneflower
already<00:04:01.790> flowering<00:04:02.240> here<00:04:02.920> goldenrods<00:04:03.920> so

00:04:04.600 --> 00:04:04.610 
already flowering here goldenrods so

00:04:04.610 --> 00:04:06.820 
already flowering here goldenrods so
those<00:04:04.760> are<00:04:05.000> really<00:04:05.840> important<00:04:06.260> species<00:04:06.440> for

00:04:06.820 --> 00:04:06.830 
those are really important species for

00:04:06.830 --> 00:04:09.430 
those are really important species for
pollinators<00:04:07.490> and<00:04:07.790> they<00:04:08.180> help<00:04:08.390> support<00:04:09.140> the

00:04:09.430 --> 00:04:09.440 
pollinators and they help support the

00:04:09.440 --> 00:04:10.930 
pollinators and they help support the
food<00:04:09.590> web<00:04:09.800> with<00:04:10.010> all<00:04:10.130> the<00:04:10.250> insects<00:04:10.640> that<00:04:10.820> they

00:04:10.930 --> 00:04:10.940 
food web with all the insects that they

00:04:10.940 --> 00:04:14.110 
food web with all the insects that they
support<00:04:11.330> so<00:04:12.230> we<00:04:12.320> like<00:04:12.470> to<00:04:12.560> see<00:04:12.710> those<00:04:12.890> but<00:04:13.850> in

00:04:14.110 --> 00:04:14.120 
support so we like to see those but in

00:04:14.120 --> 00:04:16.509 
support so we like to see those but in
some<00:04:14.330> cases<00:04:14.540> things<00:04:15.440> like<00:04:15.680> Canada<00:04:16.070> goldenrod

00:04:16.509 --> 00:04:16.519 
some cases things like Canada goldenrod

00:04:16.519 --> 00:04:18.280 
some cases things like Canada goldenrod
can<00:04:16.790> be<00:04:16.910> a<00:04:17.209> real<00:04:17.480> problem<00:04:17.660> in<00:04:17.959> our<00:04:18.019> perennial

00:04:18.280 --> 00:04:18.290 
can be a real problem in our perennial

00:04:18.290 --> 00:04:21.160 
can be a real problem in our perennial
grasslands<00:04:18.830> and<00:04:19.570> mowing<00:04:20.570> that<00:04:20.750> twice<00:04:20.989> during

00:04:21.160 --> 00:04:21.170 
grasslands and mowing that twice during

00:04:21.170 --> 00:04:22.660 
grasslands and mowing that twice during
the<00:04:21.260> summer<00:04:21.530> really<00:04:21.739> started<00:04:22.160> to<00:04:22.280> depress

00:04:22.660 --> 00:04:22.670 
the summer really started to depress

00:04:22.670 --> 00:04:25.630 
the summer really started to depress
some<00:04:23.330> of<00:04:23.420> those<00:04:23.510> more<00:04:23.750> weedy<00:04:23.960> species<00:04:24.610> so<00:04:25.610> I

00:04:25.630 --> 00:04:25.640 
some of those more weedy species so I

00:04:25.640 --> 00:04:27.160 
some of those more weedy species so I
think<00:04:25.820> what's<00:04:25.970> exciting<00:04:26.090> about<00:04:26.450> this<00:04:26.720> project

00:04:27.160 --> 00:04:27.170 
think what's exciting about this project

00:04:27.170 --> 00:04:30.280 
think what's exciting about this project
is<00:04:27.320> it<00:04:28.060> starts<00:04:29.060> to<00:04:29.210> scratch<00:04:29.600> the<00:04:29.780> surface<00:04:29.930> more

00:04:30.280 --> 00:04:30.290 
is it starts to scratch the surface more

00:04:30.290 --> 00:04:32.140 
is it starts to scratch the surface more
on<00:04:30.500> some<00:04:30.890> of<00:04:30.950> the<00:04:31.010> more<00:04:31.130> active<00:04:31.190> management<00:04:31.880> we

00:04:32.140 --> 00:04:32.150 
on some of the more active management we

00:04:32.150 --> 00:04:33.550 
on some of the more active management we
could<00:04:32.300> be<00:04:32.390> taking<00:04:32.540> with<00:04:32.840> our<00:04:33.050> native

00:04:33.550 --> 00:04:33.560 
could be taking with our native

00:04:33.560 --> 00:04:37.630 
could be taking with our native
grasslands<00:04:34.190> so<00:04:35.120> not<00:04:35.240> just<00:04:35.480> burning<00:04:36.440> and<00:04:36.680> you

00:04:37.630 --> 00:04:37.640 
grasslands so not just burning and you

00:04:37.640 --> 00:04:39.070 
grasslands so not just burning and you
know<00:04:37.730> doing<00:04:37.910> some<00:04:38.150> hand<00:04:38.390> cutting<00:04:38.630> to<00:04:38.840> get<00:04:38.960> rid

00:04:39.070 --> 00:04:39.080 
know doing some hand cutting to get rid

00:04:39.080 --> 00:04:41.470 
know doing some hand cutting to get rid
of<00:04:39.140> shrubs<00:04:39.410> but<00:04:39.730> mowing<00:04:40.730> and<00:04:40.850> grazing<00:04:41.300> and

00:04:41.470 --> 00:04:41.480 
of shrubs but mowing and grazing and

00:04:41.480 --> 00:04:43.240 
of shrubs but mowing and grazing and
different<00:04:42.110> combinations<00:04:42.320> of<00:04:42.800> these<00:04:42.920> things

00:04:43.240 --> 00:04:43.250 
different combinations of these things

00:04:43.250 --> 00:04:45.760 
different combinations of these things
could<00:04:43.520> really<00:04:43.550> start<00:04:44.300> to<00:04:44.450> create<00:04:45.140> more<00:04:45.350> niches

00:04:45.760 --> 00:04:45.770 
could really start to create more niches

00:04:45.770 --> 00:04:47.500 
could really start to create more niches
for<00:04:46.460> different<00:04:46.700> kinds<00:04:46.970> of<00:04:47.060> plants<00:04:47.390> and

00:04:47.500 --> 00:04:47.510 
for different kinds of plants and

00:04:47.510 --> 00:04:50.350 
for different kinds of plants and
wildlife<00:04:47.630> and<00:04:48.140> also<00:04:48.890> I<00:04:48.920> think<00:04:49.270> helped<00:04:50.270> to

00:04:50.350 --> 00:04:50.360 
wildlife and also I think helped to

00:04:50.360 --> 00:04:53.230 
wildlife and also I think helped to
integrate<00:04:51.460> these<00:04:52.460> types<00:04:52.730> of<00:04:52.850> community

00:04:53.230 --> 00:04:53.240 
integrate these types of community

00:04:53.240 --> 00:04:55.720 
integrate these types of community
communities<00:04:53.810> more<00:04:54.080> into<00:04:54.410> working<00:04:55.340> farms

00:04:55.720 --> 00:04:55.730 
communities more into working farms

00:04:55.730 --> 00:04:57.010 
communities more into working farms
where<00:04:55.970> people<00:04:56.360> also<00:04:56.480> need<00:04:56.690> to<00:04:56.780> be<00:04:56.870> able<00:04:56.930> to

00:04:57.010 --> 00:04:57.020 
where people also need to be able to

00:04:57.020 --> 00:05:00.100 
where people also need to be able to
make<00:04:57.140> a<00:04:57.169> profit<00:04:57.460> off<00:04:58.460> of<00:04:58.520> the<00:04:58.940> land<00:04:59.840> that<00:04:59.930> they

00:05:00.100 --> 00:05:00.110 
make a profit off of the land that they

00:05:00.110 --> 00:05:02.440 
make a profit off of the land that they
have<00:05:00.260> out<00:05:00.410> there
