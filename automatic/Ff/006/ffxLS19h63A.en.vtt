00:06:03.110 --> 00:06:03.120 
this card being the same for XYZ is what

00:06:03.120 --> 00:06:04.340 
this card being the same for XYZ is what
I<00:06:03.150> was<00:06:03.330> starting<00:06:03.660> reading<00:06:03.780> it's<00:06:03.990> a<00:06:04.050> fact<00:06:04.260> I'm

00:06:04.340 --> 00:06:04.350 
I was starting reading it's a fact I'm

00:06:04.350 --> 00:06:06.020 
I was starting reading it's a fact I'm
like<00:06:04.470> man<00:06:04.890> you<00:06:05.040> just<00:06:05.130> make<00:06:05.310> this<00:06:05.460> card<00:06:05.700> then<00:06:05.880> go

00:06:06.020 --> 00:06:06.030 
like man you just make this card then go

00:06:06.030 --> 00:06:07.730 
like man you just make this card then go
into<00:06:06.150> like<00:06:06.360> you<00:06:06.390> know<00:06:06.540> anything<00:06:07.110> from<00:06:07.410> you

00:06:07.730 --> 00:06:07.740 
into like you know anything from you

00:06:07.740 --> 00:06:13.880 
into like you know anything from you
know<00:06:07.940> 42<00:06:08.940> ah<00:06:11.450> seven<00:06:12.450> so<00:06:12.780> that<00:06:13.110> means<00:06:13.380> like

00:06:13.880 --> 00:06:13.890 
know 42 ah seven so that means like

00:06:13.890 --> 00:06:15.470 
know 42 ah seven so that means like
draco<00:06:14.340> sack<00:06:14.610> which<00:06:14.880> would<00:06:15.000> be<00:06:15.120> pretty<00:06:15.390> cool

00:06:15.470 --> 00:06:15.480 
draco sack which would be pretty cool

00:06:15.480 --> 00:06:17.840 
draco sack which would be pretty cool
but<00:06:15.930> I<00:06:16.140> obviously<00:06:16.920> with<00:06:17.310> that<00:06:17.430> downside<00:06:17.820> that

00:06:17.840 --> 00:06:17.850 
but I obviously with that downside that

00:06:17.850 --> 00:06:21.350 
but I obviously with that downside that
you<00:06:18.810> can't<00:06:19.140> really<00:06:19.230> XYZ<00:06:19.800> it<00:06:20.120> after<00:06:21.120> that<00:06:21.240> but

00:06:21.350 --> 00:06:21.360 
you can't really XYZ it after that but

00:06:21.360 --> 00:06:22.550 
you can't really XYZ it after that but
nonetheless<00:06:21.600> it's<00:06:21.990> cool<00:06:22.230> that<00:06:22.260> they're<00:06:22.500> you

00:06:22.550 --> 00:06:22.560 
nonetheless it's cool that they're you

00:06:22.560 --> 00:06:24.230 
nonetheless it's cool that they're you
know<00:06:22.800> a<00:06:23.100> lot<00:06:23.340> of<00:06:23.460> players<00:06:23.640> were<00:06:23.850> thinking<00:06:24.090> that

00:06:24.230 --> 00:06:24.240 
know a lot of players were thinking that

00:06:24.240 --> 00:06:25.730 
know a lot of players were thinking that
they<00:06:24.360> were<00:06:24.420> gonna<00:06:24.660> like<00:06:24.870> stop<00:06:25.170> synchros<00:06:25.560> like

00:06:25.730 --> 00:06:25.740 
they were gonna like stop synchros like

00:06:25.740 --> 00:06:27.140 
they were gonna like stop synchros like
XYZ's<00:06:26.280> where<00:06:26.460> the<00:06:26.550> only<00:06:26.760> thing<00:06:26.880> that<00:06:27.030> we're

00:06:27.140 --> 00:06:27.150 
XYZ's where the only thing that we're

00:06:27.150 --> 00:06:29.300 
XYZ's where the only thing that we're
going<00:06:27.570> to<00:06:27.630> be<00:06:27.690> like<00:06:27.930> the<00:06:28.350> new<00:06:28.530> thing<00:06:28.800> I<00:06:28.950> think

00:06:29.300 --> 00:06:29.310 
going to be like the new thing I think

00:06:29.310 --> 00:06:30.230 
going to be like the new thing I think
synchros<00:06:29.610> are<00:06:29.640> still<00:06:29.880> relevant<00:06:30.090> I<00:06:30.210> think

00:06:30.230 --> 00:06:30.240 
synchros are still relevant I think

00:06:30.240 --> 00:06:32.300 
synchros are still relevant I think
expose<00:06:30.720> these<00:06:30.840> are<00:06:30.990> still<00:06:31.500> relevant<00:06:31.710> I<00:06:31.920> think

00:06:32.300 --> 00:06:32.310 
expose these are still relevant I think

00:06:32.310 --> 00:06:33.590 
expose these are still relevant I think
if<00:06:32.400> anything<00:06:32.790> is<00:06:32.910> not<00:06:33.090> relevant<00:06:33.360> right<00:06:33.480> now

00:06:33.590 --> 00:06:33.600 
if anything is not relevant right now

00:06:33.600 --> 00:06:36.200 
if anything is not relevant right now
it's<00:06:33.930> the<00:06:33.990> ritual<00:06:34.350> monsters<00:06:34.860> I<00:06:35.220> mean<00:06:35.820> we

00:06:36.200 --> 00:06:36.210 
it's the ritual monsters I mean we

00:06:36.210 --> 00:06:38.420 
it's the ritual monsters I mean we
occasionally<00:06:36.720> still<00:06:36.900> use<00:06:37.050> fusion<00:06:37.770> monsters

00:06:38.420 --> 00:06:38.430 
occasionally still use fusion monsters

00:06:38.430 --> 00:06:40.610 
occasionally still use fusion monsters
most<00:06:39.060> of<00:06:39.120> the<00:06:39.180> time<00:06:39.300> is<00:06:39.480> used<00:06:40.200> with<00:06:40.410> just

00:06:40.610 --> 00:06:40.620 
most of the time is used with just

00:06:40.620 --> 00:06:41.780 
most of the time is used with just
instant<00:06:41.010> fusion<00:06:41.070> to<00:06:41.280> bring<00:06:41.400> down<00:06:41.550> for<00:06:41.670> like

00:06:41.780 --> 00:06:41.790 
instant fusion to bring down for like

00:06:41.790 --> 00:06:43.370 
instant fusion to bring down for like
half<00:06:41.940> a<00:06:42.060> second<00:06:42.450> anyways<00:06:42.750> but<00:06:43.110> I<00:06:43.200> feel<00:06:43.350> like

00:06:43.370 --> 00:06:43.380 
half a second anyways but I feel like

00:06:43.380 --> 00:06:44.810 
half a second anyways but I feel like
they<00:06:43.740> really<00:06:43.770> need<00:06:44.130> some<00:06:44.280> better<00:06:44.400> fusion

00:06:44.810 --> 00:06:44.820 
they really need some better fusion

00:06:44.820 --> 00:06:46.310 
they really need some better fusion
monsters<00:06:45.150> they<00:06:45.270> need<00:06:45.390> some<00:06:45.570> retro<00:06:45.870> monsters

00:06:46.310 --> 00:06:46.320 
monsters they need some retro monsters

00:06:46.320 --> 00:06:48.290 
monsters they need some retro monsters
but<00:06:46.530> I<00:06:46.680> think<00:06:47.040> we<00:06:47.130> should<00:06:47.280> incorporate<00:06:47.940> all

00:06:48.290 --> 00:06:48.300 
but I think we should incorporate all

00:06:48.300 --> 00:06:50.330 
but I think we should incorporate all
the<00:06:48.780> you<00:06:48.990> know<00:06:49.110> types<00:06:49.680> of<00:06:49.830> cards<00:06:49.980> in<00:06:50.100> yugioh

00:06:50.330 --> 00:06:50.340 
the you know types of cards in yugioh

00:06:50.340 --> 00:06:52.190 
the you know types of cards in yugioh
not<00:06:50.550> just<00:06:50.790> the<00:06:50.880> syncros<00:06:51.210> not<00:06:51.390> just<00:06:51.630> the<00:06:51.690> xyz's

00:06:52.190 --> 00:06:52.200 
not just the syncros not just the xyz's

00:06:52.200 --> 00:06:53.510 
not just the syncros not just the xyz's
and<00:06:52.350> a<00:06:52.380> fact<00:06:52.560> monsters<00:06:52.920> because<00:06:53.100> I<00:06:53.250> think

00:06:53.510 --> 00:06:53.520 
and a fact monsters because I think

00:06:53.520 --> 00:06:54.740 
and a fact monsters because I think
that's<00:06:53.730> pretty<00:06:53.850> much<00:06:54.030> what<00:06:54.210> it<00:06:54.240> comes<00:06:54.420> down<00:06:54.540> to

00:06:54.740 --> 00:06:54.750 
that's pretty much what it comes down to

00:06:54.750 --> 00:06:56.570 
that's pretty much what it comes down to
four<00:06:54.900> monsters<00:06:55.230> right<00:06:55.350> now<00:06:55.500> I<00:06:55.710> mean<00:06:56.010> we<00:06:56.340> can't

00:06:56.570 --> 00:06:56.580 
four monsters right now I mean we can't

00:06:56.580 --> 00:06:58.220 
four monsters right now I mean we can't
even<00:06:56.700> play<00:06:56.850> straddles<00:06:57.360> how<00:06:57.570> do<00:06:57.630> we<00:06:57.750> get<00:06:57.870> out<00:06:57.930> re

even play straddles how do we get out re

00:06:58.230 --> 00:07:00.770 
even play straddles how do we get out re
heroes<00:06:58.740> but<00:06:58.980> anyways<00:06:59.970> let<00:07:00.120> me<00:07:00.210> know<00:07:00.330> guys<00:07:00.480> if

00:07:00.770 --> 00:07:00.780 
heroes but anyways let me know guys if

00:07:00.780 --> 00:07:03.170 
heroes but anyways let me know guys if
you<00:07:00.900> guys<00:07:00.930> are<00:07:01.410> you<00:07:02.280> know<00:07:02.370> interested<00:07:02.820> in<00:07:02.970> any

00:07:03.170 --> 00:07:03.180 
you guys are you know interested in any

00:07:03.180 --> 00:07:04.550 
you guys are you know interested in any
of<00:07:03.300> these<00:07:03.390> cards<00:07:03.630> brother<00:07:03.870> you<00:07:04.080> know<00:07:04.320> some

00:07:04.550 --> 00:07:04.560 
of these cards brother you know some

00:07:04.560 --> 00:07:06.440 
of these cards brother you know some
crazy<00:07:04.800> combo<00:07:05.160> I<00:07:05.340> feel<00:07:05.760> like<00:07:05.850> this<00:07:06.060> card<00:07:06.270> has

00:07:06.440 --> 00:07:06.450 
crazy combo I feel like this card has

00:07:06.450 --> 00:07:08.480 
crazy combo I feel like this card has
some<00:07:06.720> potential<00:07:07.130> obviously<00:07:08.130> since<00:07:08.250> you<00:07:08.400> can

00:07:08.480 --> 00:07:08.490 
some potential obviously since you can

00:07:08.490 --> 00:07:09.590 
some potential obviously since you can
only<00:07:08.520> use<00:07:08.640> the<00:07:08.820> effect<00:07:09.000> once<00:07:09.180> per<00:07:09.300> turn<00:07:09.330> that

00:07:09.590 --> 00:07:09.600 
only use the effect once per turn that

00:07:09.600 --> 00:07:11.000 
only use the effect once per turn that
really<00:07:09.870> limits<00:07:10.170> you<00:07:10.470> all<00:07:10.590> what<00:07:10.710> you<00:07:10.800> can<00:07:10.920> do

00:07:11.000 --> 00:07:11.010 
really limits you all what you can do

00:07:11.010 --> 00:07:12.740 
really limits you all what you can do
but<00:07:11.370> you<00:07:11.460> can<00:07:11.490> one<00:07:11.790> for<00:07:12.030> one<00:07:12.150> with<00:07:12.180> this<00:07:12.450> card

00:07:12.740 --> 00:07:12.750 
but you can one for one with this card

00:07:12.750 --> 00:07:17.540 
but you can one for one with this card
so<00:07:13.110> I<00:07:13.530> that's<00:07:14.430> just<00:07:14.580> a<00:07:14.640> thought<00:07:15.240> but<00:07:15.450> um<00:07:16.350> I<00:07:16.550> feel

00:07:17.540 --> 00:07:17.550 
so I that's just a thought but um I feel

00:07:17.550 --> 00:07:18.800 
so I that's just a thought but um I feel
like<00:07:17.670> like<00:07:17.820> even<00:07:17.940> harder<00:07:18.210> to<00:07:18.270> make<00:07:18.450> some<00:07:18.600> cool

00:07:18.800 --> 00:07:18.810 
like like even harder to make some cool

00:07:18.810 --> 00:07:20.840
