out<00:00:55.260> with<00:00:55.350> youtube<00:00:55.770> but<00:00:56.250> let's<00:00:56.489> move<00:00:56.640> on<00:00:56.850> a

00:00:56.869 --> 00:00:56.879 
out with youtube but let's move on a

00:00:56.879 --> 00:00:58.340 
out with youtube but let's move on a
little<00:00:57.000> bit<00:00:57.360> to<00:00:57.480> the<00:00:57.570> gameplay<00:00:57.780> and<00:00:58.170> you<00:00:58.230> may

00:00:58.340 --> 00:00:58.350 
little bit to the gameplay and you may

00:00:58.350 --> 00:01:00.139 
little bit to the gameplay and you may
say<00:00:58.379> quad<00:00:58.920> what<00:00:59.430> the<00:00:59.579> heck<00:00:59.730> is<00:00:59.760> wrong<00:00:59.940> with

00:01:00.139 --> 00:01:00.149 
say quad what the heck is wrong with

00:01:00.149 --> 00:01:01.670 
say quad what the heck is wrong with
your<00:01:00.480> gun<00:01:00.660> you're<00:01:00.899> using<00:01:01.109> some<00:01:01.379> sort<00:01:01.559> of

00:01:01.670 --> 00:01:01.680 
your gun you're using some sort of

00:01:01.680 --> 00:01:03.619 
your gun you're using some sort of
cheats<00:01:01.949> or<00:01:02.129> hacks<00:01:02.160> or<00:01:02.699> glitches<00:01:03.149> or<00:01:03.180> something

00:01:03.619 --> 00:01:03.629 
cheats or hacks or glitches or something

00:01:03.629 --> 00:01:06.500 
cheats or hacks or glitches or something
like<00:01:03.750> that<00:01:03.809> but<00:01:04.199> no<00:01:04.769> this<00:01:05.010> is<00:01:05.129> on<00:01:05.280> pc<00:01:05.820> and<00:01:06.299> what

00:01:06.500 --> 00:01:06.510 
like that but no this is on pc and what

00:01:06.510 --> 00:01:08.539 
like that but no this is on pc and what
I<00:01:06.540> did<00:01:06.840> is<00:01:07.020> it's<00:01:07.409> actually<00:01:07.710> called<00:01:07.890> an<00:01:08.040> fov

00:01:08.539 --> 00:01:08.549 
I did is it's actually called an fov

00:01:08.549 --> 00:01:10.130 
I did is it's actually called an fov
changer<00:01:08.970> and<00:01:09.119> what<00:01:09.240> it<00:01:09.330> does<00:01:09.450> is<00:01:09.659> it<00:01:09.689> makes<00:01:09.869> it

00:01:10.130 --> 00:01:10.140 
changer and what it does is it makes it

00:01:10.140 --> 00:01:12.500 
changer and what it does is it makes it
so<00:01:10.260> I<00:01:10.290> can<00:01:10.500> see<00:01:10.770> basically<00:01:11.549> my<00:01:12.000> peripheral

00:01:12.500 --> 00:01:12.510 
so I can see basically my peripheral

00:01:12.510 --> 00:01:14.060 
so I can see basically my peripheral
vision<00:01:12.600> a<00:01:13.049> little<00:01:13.350> bit<00:01:13.470> better<00:01:13.590> and<00:01:13.799> it<00:01:13.890> also

00:01:14.060 --> 00:01:14.070 
vision a little bit better and it also

00:01:14.070 --> 00:01:16.399 
vision a little bit better and it also
makes<00:01:14.220> my<00:01:14.580> gun<00:01:14.820> look<00:01:15.030> really<00:01:15.360> far<00:01:15.600> out<00:01:15.630> I<00:01:15.810> kind

00:01:16.399 --> 00:01:16.409 
makes my gun look really far out I kind

00:01:16.409 --> 00:01:17.870 
makes my gun look really far out I kind
of<00:01:16.470> think<00:01:16.590> it<00:01:16.740> looks<00:01:16.890> really<00:01:16.950> cool<00:01:17.369> actually<00:01:17.610> I

00:01:17.870 --> 00:01:17.880 
of think it looks really cool actually I

00:01:17.880 --> 00:01:21.109 
of think it looks really cool actually I
if<00:01:18.630> you<00:01:18.659> could<00:01:18.990> do<00:01:19.110> this<00:01:19.290> on<00:01:19.439> console<00:01:20.040> I<00:01:20.280> think

00:01:21.109 --> 00:01:21.119 
if you could do this on console I think

00:01:21.119 --> 00:01:22.760 
if you could do this on console I think
I'd<00:01:21.270> actually<00:01:21.450> do<00:01:21.750> it<00:01:21.869> a<00:01:21.930> lot<00:01:22.140> but<00:01:22.290> I<00:01:22.350> do<00:01:22.470> really

00:01:22.760 --> 00:01:22.770 
I'd actually do it a lot but I do really

00:01:22.770 --> 00:01:24.920 
I'd actually do it a lot but I do really
like<00:01:22.950> the<00:01:23.130> way<00:01:23.250> this<00:01:23.430> looks<00:01:23.490> so<00:01:24.000> it's<00:01:24.330> not<00:01:24.689> some

00:01:24.920 --> 00:01:24.930 
like the way this looks so it's not some

00:01:24.930 --> 00:01:26.390 
like the way this looks so it's not some
sort<00:01:25.080> of<00:01:25.200> hack<00:01:25.409> or<00:01:25.619> anything<00:01:25.950> it<00:01:26.070> just<00:01:26.100> makes

00:01:26.390 --> 00:01:26.400 
sort of hack or anything it just makes

00:01:26.400 --> 00:01:28.550 
sort of hack or anything it just makes
it<00:01:26.490> so<00:01:26.549> I<00:01:26.670> can<00:01:26.850> see<00:01:27.000> my<00:01:27.150> peripherals<00:01:27.780> just<00:01:28.439> a

00:01:28.550 --> 00:01:28.560 
it so I can see my peripherals just a

00:01:28.560 --> 00:01:30.170 
it so I can see my peripherals just a
little<00:01:28.710> bit<00:01:28.890> better<00:01:29.040> practically<00:01:29.729> everyone

00:01:30.170 --> 00:01:30.180 
little bit better practically everyone

00:01:30.180 --> 00:01:32.300 
little bit better practically everyone
uses<00:01:30.659> it<00:01:30.840> actually<00:01:31.439> I<00:01:31.500> do<00:01:31.590> think<00:01:31.920> everyone

00:01:32.300 --> 00:01:32.310 
uses it actually I do think everyone

00:01:32.310 --> 00:01:34.100 
uses it actually I do think everyone
uses<00:01:32.700> a<00:01:32.850> even<00:01:33.270> though<00:01:33.360> they<00:01:33.509> didn't<00:01:33.810> implement

00:01:34.110 --> 00:01:36.140 
uses a even though they didn't implement
it<00:01:34.320> into<00:01:34.439> modern<00:01:34.590> warfare<00:01:34.890> 3<00:01:35.100> they<00:01:35.790> did<00:01:35.970> for

00:01:36.140 --> 00:01:36.150 
it into modern warfare 3 they did for

00:01:36.150 --> 00:01:38.149 
it into modern warfare 3 they did for
black<00:01:36.360> ops<00:01:36.540> 2<00:01:36.869> I<00:01:36.900> don't<00:01:37.470> think<00:01:37.740> they<00:01:37.860> did<00:01:37.920> for

00:01:38.149 --> 00:01:38.159 
black ops 2 I don't think they did for

00:01:38.159 --> 00:01:40.190 
black ops 2 I don't think they did for
modern<00:01:38.400> warfare<00:01:38.549> 2<00:01:38.939> but<00:01:39.479> they<00:01:39.600> did<00:01:39.780> for<00:01:39.990> black

00:01:40.190 --> 00:01:40.200 
modern warfare 2 but they did for black

00:01:40.200 --> 00:01:43.340 
modern warfare 2 but they did for black
ops<00:01:40.380> 1<00:01:40.590> and<00:01:41.159> cod4<00:01:41.700> and<00:01:42.060> world<00:01:42.240> at<00:01:42.390> war<00:01:42.600> I<00:01:42.930> don't

00:01:43.340 --> 00:01:43.350 
ops 1 and cod4 and world at war I don't

00:01:43.350 --> 00:01:44.870 
ops 1 and cod4 and world at war I don't
know<00:01:43.470> why<00:01:43.680> they<00:01:43.890> wouldn't<00:01:44.159> implement<00:01:44.700> it<00:01:44.759> to

00:01:44.870 --> 00:01:44.880 
know why they wouldn't implement it to

00:01:44.880 --> 00:01:47.120 
know why they wouldn't implement it to
modern<00:01:45.119> warfare<00:01:45.149> 3<00:01:45.479> or<00:01:45.780> modern<00:01:46.020> warfare<00:01:46.170> 2<00:01:46.560> but

00:01:47.120 --> 00:01:47.130 
modern warfare 3 or modern warfare 2 but

00:01:47.130 --> 00:01:48.710 
modern warfare 3 or modern warfare 2 but
I<00:01:47.159> guess<00:01:47.430> it's<00:01:47.579> kind<00:01:47.820> of<00:01:47.880> up<00:01:47.970> to<00:01:48.000> the<00:01:48.149> creators

00:01:48.710 --> 00:01:48.720 
I guess it's kind of up to the creators

00:01:48.720 --> 00:01:50.719 
I guess it's kind of up to the creators
so<00:01:48.869> the<00:01:48.990> people<00:01:49.290> who<00:01:49.710> actually<00:01:49.920> handle<00:01:50.520> call

00:01:50.719 --> 00:01:50.729 
so the people who actually handle call

00:01:50.729 --> 00:01:52.730 
so the people who actually handle call
of<00:01:50.880> duty<00:01:51.090> on<00:01:51.180> the<00:01:51.299> pc<00:01:51.689> side<00:01:51.990> but<00:01:52.229> you<00:01:52.320> can<00:01:52.470> see

00:01:52.730 --> 00:01:52.740 
of duty on the pc side but you can see

00:01:52.740 --> 00:01:55.010 
of duty on the pc side but you can see
that<00:01:53.009> my<00:01:53.399> aim<00:01:53.670> is<00:01:53.850> actually<00:01:54.390> pretty<00:01:54.659> good

00:01:55.010 --> 00:01:55.020 
that my aim is actually pretty good

00:01:55.020 --> 00:01:56.899 
that my aim is actually pretty good
pretty<00:01:55.320> gosh<00:01:55.590> darn<00:01:55.619> good<00:01:56.130> on<00:01:56.250> the<00:01:56.369> pc<00:01:56.729> it's<00:01:56.850> a

00:01:56.899 --> 00:01:56.909 
pretty gosh darn good on the pc it's a

00:01:56.909 --> 00:01:58.819 
pretty gosh darn good on the pc it's a
little<00:01:57.149> bit<00:01:57.270> better<00:01:57.390> on<00:01:57.689> the<00:01:58.140> pc<00:01:58.530> than<00:01:58.710> it

00:01:58.819 --> 00:01:58.829 
little bit better on the pc than it

00:01:58.829 --> 00:02:00.440 
little bit better on the pc than it
actually<00:01:58.979> is<00:01:59.219> on<00:01:59.430> console<00:01:59.909> i<00:02:00.000> kind<00:02:00.240> of<00:02:00.270> think

00:02:02.240 --> 00:02:02.250 
it's like that way mainly because the

00:02:02.250 --> 00:02:03.679 
it's like that way mainly because the
fact<00:02:02.490> that<00:02:02.579> i'm<00:02:02.729> using<00:02:02.759> a<00:02:03.060> mouse<00:02:03.240> and<00:02:03.509> keyboard

00:02:03.679 --> 00:02:03.689

00:02:03.689 --> 00:02:06.469 
fact that i'm using a mouse and keyboard
which<00:02:04.170> using<00:02:04.799> a<00:02:04.890> mouse<00:02:05.009> and<00:02:05.280> keyboard<00:02:05.460> its<00:02:06.000> if
