attract flies and stuff there are ways

00:00:47.760 --> 00:00:49.490 
attract flies and stuff there are ways
that<00:00:47.789> you<00:00:48.090> can<00:00:48.180> make<00:00:48.480> containers<00:00:49.170> for<00:00:49.350> them

00:00:49.490 --> 00:00:49.500 
that you can make containers for them

00:00:49.500 --> 00:00:52.939 
that you can make containers for them
where<00:00:49.940> fruit<00:00:50.940> flies<00:00:51.149> can't<00:00:51.539> get<00:00:51.719> in<00:00:51.870> you<00:00:52.800> can

00:00:52.939 --> 00:00:52.949 
where fruit flies can't get in you can

00:00:52.949 --> 00:00:54.650 
where fruit flies can't get in you can
do<00:00:53.070> that<00:00:53.100> right<00:00:53.520> and<00:00:53.730> I'm<00:00:53.850> in<00:00:53.969> the<00:00:54.059> process<00:00:54.239> of

00:00:54.650 --> 00:00:54.660 
do that right and I'm in the process of

00:00:54.660 --> 00:00:57.549 
do that right and I'm in the process of
doing<00:00:54.809> that<00:00:54.989> because<00:00:56.030> I'm<00:00:57.030> going<00:00:57.180> to<00:00:57.239> be<00:00:57.329> using

00:00:57.549 --> 00:00:57.559 
doing that because I'm going to be using

00:00:57.559 --> 00:01:00.349 
doing that because I'm going to be using
other<00:00:58.559> bins<00:00:59.039> for<00:00:59.309> these<00:00:59.460> things<00:00:59.760> soon<00:01:00.059> but

00:01:00.349 --> 00:01:00.359 
other bins for these things soon but

00:01:00.359 --> 00:01:01.729 
other bins for these things soon but
this<00:01:00.629> is<00:01:00.780> the<00:01:00.870> method<00:01:01.020> I'm<00:01:01.260> using<00:01:01.440> right<00:01:01.710> now

00:01:01.729 --> 00:01:01.739 
this is the method I'm using right now

00:01:01.739 --> 00:01:04.100 
this is the method I'm using right now
that<00:01:02.100> works<00:01:02.309> really<00:01:02.730> well<00:01:02.879> and<00:01:03.690> here's<00:01:03.930> how

00:01:04.100 --> 00:01:04.110 
that works really well and here's how

00:01:04.110 --> 00:01:07.580 
that works really well and here's how
how<00:01:04.500> it<00:01:04.680> works<00:01:04.920> as<00:01:05.760> you<00:01:06.540> can<00:01:06.810> see<00:01:06.960> I<00:01:06.990> have<00:01:07.260> a<00:01:07.290> top

00:01:07.580 --> 00:01:07.590 
how it works as you can see I have a top

00:01:07.590 --> 00:01:08.620 
how it works as you can see I have a top
bin<00:01:07.860> here

00:01:08.620 --> 00:01:08.630 
bin here

00:01:08.630 --> 00:01:13.910 
bin here
alright<00:01:09.630> and<00:01:11.119> the<00:01:12.119> bottom<00:01:12.540> I<00:01:12.689> cut<00:01:13.049> out<00:01:13.080> pretty

00:01:13.910 --> 00:01:13.920 
alright and the bottom I cut out pretty

00:01:13.920 --> 00:01:14.450 
alright and the bottom I cut out pretty
much

00:01:14.450 --> 00:01:14.460 
much

00:01:14.460 --> 00:01:18.380 
much
I<00:01:14.490> used<00:01:15.330> a<00:01:16.100> jigsaw<00:01:17.100> and<00:01:17.280> I<00:01:17.400> or<00:01:17.880> no<00:01:18.000> I<00:01:18.030> think<00:01:18.210> I

00:01:18.380 --> 00:01:18.390 
I used a jigsaw and I or no I think I

00:01:18.390 --> 00:01:20.990 
I used a jigsaw and I or no I think I
just<00:01:18.600> cut<00:01:19.229> it<00:01:19.259> out<00:01:19.470> somehow<00:01:19.920> I<00:01:19.950> forget<00:01:20.430> how<00:01:20.549> I<00:01:20.580> I

00:01:20.990 --> 00:01:21.000 
just cut it out somehow I forget how I I

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:22.789 
just cut it out somehow I forget how I I
think<00:01:21.450> I<00:01:21.540> pretty<00:01:21.930> much<00:01:21.990> ripped<00:01:22.409> out<00:01:22.619> the

00:01:22.789 --> 00:01:22.799 
think I pretty much ripped out the

00:01:22.799 --> 00:01:26.359 
think I pretty much ripped out the
bottom<00:01:23.100> so<00:01:23.189> I'm<00:01:23.280> out<00:01:23.460> but<00:01:24.210> I<00:01:24.570> weaved<00:01:25.320> in<00:01:25.619> I<00:01:25.920> put

00:01:26.359 --> 00:01:26.369 
bottom so I'm out but I weaved in I put

00:01:26.369 --> 00:01:29.179 
bottom so I'm out but I weaved in I put
some<00:01:26.580> screening<00:01:27.450> in<00:01:27.600> and<00:01:27.810> I<00:01:28.530> weaved<00:01:28.890> it<00:01:29.070> in

00:01:29.179 --> 00:01:29.189 
some screening in and I weaved it in

00:01:29.189 --> 00:01:31.280 
some screening in and I weaved it in
with<00:01:29.369> wire<00:01:29.900> all<00:01:30.900> right

00:01:31.280 --> 00:01:31.290 
with wire all right

00:01:31.290 --> 00:01:33.289 
with wire all right
so<00:01:31.680> the<00:01:31.950> beetles<00:01:32.130> can't<00:01:32.460> fall<00:01:32.700> through<00:01:33.030> but

00:01:33.289 --> 00:01:33.299 
so the beetles can't fall through but

00:01:33.299 --> 00:01:37.910 
so the beetles can't fall through but
their<00:01:33.869> eggs<00:01:34.140> do<00:01:34.950> and<00:01:35.310> young<00:01:36.150> worms<00:01:36.420> do<00:01:36.780> okay<00:01:37.740> I

00:01:37.910 --> 00:01:37.920 
their eggs do and young worms do okay I

00:01:37.920 --> 00:01:39.440 
their eggs do and young worms do okay I
just<00:01:38.280> throw<00:01:38.460> vegetables<00:01:38.700> fruit<00:01:39.329> and

00:02:10.160 --> 00:02:10.170 
actually isn't too many beetles in here

00:02:10.170 --> 00:02:11.830 
actually isn't too many beetles in here
because<00:02:10.440> I<00:02:10.470> actually<00:02:10.709> had<00:02:10.979> to<00:02:11.069> start<00:02:11.310> my

00:02:11.830 --> 00:02:11.840 
because I actually had to start my

00:02:11.840 --> 00:02:14.090 
because I actually had to start my
colony<00:02:12.840> over

00:02:14.090 --> 00:02:14.100 
colony over

00:02:14.100 --> 00:02:15.650 
colony over
because<00:02:14.700> the<00:02:14.880> Beatles<00:02:15.060> that<00:02:15.240> I<00:02:15.300> had<00:02:15.480> were

00:02:15.650 --> 00:02:15.660 
because the Beatles that I had were

00:02:15.660 --> 00:02:17.030 
because the Beatles that I had were
getting<00:02:15.900> old<00:02:16.080> and<00:02:16.380> they<00:02:16.440> were<00:02:16.470> dying<00:02:16.770> off<00:02:17.010> and

00:02:17.030 --> 00:02:17.040 
getting old and they were dying off and

00:02:17.040 --> 00:02:19.580 
getting old and they were dying off and
I<00:02:17.580> really<00:02:18.330> wasn't<00:02:18.510> too<00:02:18.810> smart<00:02:19.080> about<00:02:19.350> it<00:02:19.410> I

00:02:19.580 --> 00:02:19.590 
I really wasn't too smart about it I

00:02:19.590 --> 00:02:21.590 
I really wasn't too smart about it I
didn't<00:02:19.800> make<00:02:19.980> new<00:02:20.220> Beatles<00:02:20.610> in<00:02:20.760> time<00:02:20.970> so<00:02:21.330> I

00:02:21.590 --> 00:02:21.600 
didn't make new Beatles in time so I

00:02:21.600 --> 00:02:24.080 
didn't make new Beatles in time so I
have<00:02:22.260> to<00:02:22.410> had<00:02:22.890> to<00:02:22.980> redo<00:02:23.250> it<00:02:23.430> so<00:02:23.580> I<00:02:23.880> don't<00:02:24.030> have

00:02:24.080 --> 00:02:24.090 
have to had to redo it so I don't have

00:02:24.090 --> 00:02:26.930 
have to had to redo it so I don't have
too<00:02:24.240> many<00:02:24.360> Beatles<00:02:24.780> going<00:02:25.050> on<00:02:25.170> but<00:02:25.770> as<00:02:26.100> you<00:02:26.820> can

00:02:26.930 --> 00:02:26.940 
too many Beatles going on but as you can

00:02:26.940 --> 00:02:29.930 
too many Beatles going on but as you can

many mealworms super worms yet because
it's<00:03:42.720> a<00:03:42.840> new<00:03:43.460> colony<00:03:44.460> but<00:03:44.760> they<00:03:45.630> will<00:03:45.840> come<00:03:46.050> in

00:03:46.160 --> 00:03:46.170 
it's a new colony but they will come in

00:03:46.170 --> 00:03:49.270 
it's a new colony but they will come in
here<00:03:46.410> and<00:03:46.470> oh<00:03:47.370> look<00:03:48.330> a<00:03:48.450> beetle<00:03:48.750> must<00:03:48.930> have

00:03:49.270 --> 00:03:49.280 
here and oh look a beetle must have

00:03:49.280 --> 00:03:51.740 
here and oh look a beetle must have
squeezed<00:03:50.280> through<00:03:50.520> sometimes<00:03:51.510> little

00:03:51.740 --> 00:03:51.750 
squeezed through sometimes little

00:03:51.750 --> 00:03:55.400 
squeezed through sometimes little
beetles<00:03:52.110> fall<00:03:52.380> through<00:03:52.760> somehow<00:03:53.760> but<00:03:54.570> for<00:03:55.350> the

00:03:55.400 --> 00:03:55.410 
beetles fall through somehow but for the

00:03:55.410 --> 00:03:59.170 
beetles fall through somehow but for the
most<00:03:55.530> part<00:03:55.800> most<00:03:55.950> of<00:03:56.130> them<00:03:56.220> can't<00:03:56.750> but<00:03:57.750> in<00:03:57.900> here

00:03:59.170 --> 00:03:59.180 
most part most of them can't but in here

00:03:59.180 --> 00:04:01.250 
most part most of them can't but in here
this<00:04:00.180> is<00:04:00.330> where<00:04:00.480> your<00:04:00.600> mealworms<00:04:01.050> will

00:04:01.250 --> 00:04:01.260 
this is where your mealworms will

00:04:01.260 --> 00:04:02.810 
this is where your mealworms will
develop<00:04:01.680> your<00:04:01.800> super<00:04:02.070> worms<00:04:02.250> will<00:04:02.430> develop

00:04:02.810 --> 00:04:02.820 
develop your super worms will develop

00:04:02.820 --> 00:04:05.390 
develop your super worms will develop
and<00:04:03.230> if<00:04:04.230> you<00:04:04.380> give<00:04:04.530> it<00:04:04.620> about<00:04:04.740> if<00:04:05.100> you<00:04:05.220> have<00:04:05.370> a

00:04:05.390 --> 00:04:05.400 
and if you give it about if you have a

00:04:05.400 --> 00:04:08.530 
and if you give it about if you have a
huge<00:04:05.790> colony<00:04:06.330> in<00:04:06.420> here<00:04:06.660> what<00:04:07.440> I<00:04:07.470> used<00:04:07.710> to<00:04:07.800> do<00:04:07.980> is

00:04:08.530 --> 00:04:08.540 
huge colony in here what I used to do is

00:04:08.540 --> 00:04:12.199 
huge colony in here what I used to do is
when<00:04:09.540> I<00:04:09.570> had<00:04:09.840> about<00:04:10.050> 500<00:04:10.770> beetles<00:04:11.670> in<00:04:11.820> here<00:04:12.060> I

00:04:12.199 --> 00:04:12.209 
when I had about 500 beetles in here I

00:04:12.209 --> 00:04:15.680 
when I had about 500 beetles in here I
would<00:04:12.870> leave<00:04:13.080> this<00:04:13.320> bottom<00:04:13.740> bin<00:04:14.010> in<00:04:14.360> here<00:04:15.360> for

00:04:15.680 --> 00:04:15.690 
would leave this bottom bin in here for

00:04:15.690 --> 00:04:16.490 
would leave this bottom bin in here for
about<00:04:15.870> two<00:04:16.109> weeks

00:04:16.490 --> 00:04:16.500 
about two weeks

00:04:16.500 --> 00:04:18.440 
about two weeks
and<00:04:16.650> then<00:04:17.250> I<00:04:17.280> would<00:04:17.489> replace<00:04:17.820> it<00:04:17.880> with<00:04:18.150> a<00:04:18.180> fresh

00:04:18.440 --> 00:04:18.450 
and then I would replace it with a fresh

00:04:18.450 --> 00:04:21.410 
and then I would replace it with a fresh
bin<00:04:18.750> and<00:04:19.010> I<00:04:20.010> would<00:04:20.250> take<00:04:20.430> that<00:04:20.640> bin<00:04:21.239> that<00:04:21.390> I

00:04:21.410 --> 00:04:21.420 
bin and I would take that bin that I

00:04:21.420 --> 00:04:23.090 
bin and I would take that bin that I
took<00:04:21.540> out<00:04:21.870> and<00:04:22.109> I<00:04:22.229> would<00:04:22.290> let<00:04:22.530> it<00:04:22.590> sit<00:04:23.070> and

00:04:23.090 --> 00:04:23.100 
took out and I would let it sit and

00:04:23.100 --> 00:04:26.570 
took out and I would let it sit and
develop<00:04:23.580> for<00:04:24.390> another<00:04:24.600> few<00:04:24.930> weeks<00:04:24.960> to<00:04:25.410> a<00:04:25.440> month

00:04:26.570 --> 00:04:26.580 
develop for another few weeks to a month

00:04:26.580 --> 00:04:29.360 
develop for another few weeks to a month
and<00:04:26.699> I<00:04:27.180> would<00:04:27.539> have<00:04:27.720> a<00:04:27.780> probably<00:04:28.650> a<00:04:28.770> thousand

00:04:29.360 --> 00:04:29.370 
and I would have a probably a thousand

00:04:29.370 --> 00:04:31.610 
and I would have a probably a thousand
or<00:04:29.520> more<00:04:29.669> super<00:04:30.150> worms<00:04:30.270> in<00:04:30.509> there<00:04:30.689> okay<00:04:31.560> but

00:04:31.610 --> 00:04:31.620 
or more super worms in there okay but

00:04:31.620 --> 00:04:33.200 
or more super worms in there okay but
you<00:04:31.860> got<00:04:32.039> to<00:04:32.250> get<00:04:32.340> out<00:04:32.400> you<00:04:32.610> got<00:04:32.729> to<00:04:32.849> make<00:04:32.970> a<00:04:33.000> lot

00:04:33.200 --> 00:04:33.210 
you got to get out you got to make a lot

00:04:33.210 --> 00:04:35.089 
you got to get out you got to make a lot
of<00:04:33.240> beetles<00:04:33.569> guys<00:04:33.750> that's<00:04:34.470> the<00:04:34.590> only<00:04:34.800> way<00:04:34.919> this

00:04:35.089 --> 00:04:35.099 
of beetles guys that's the only way this

00:04:35.099 --> 00:04:38.029 
of beetles guys that's the only way this
is<00:04:35.159> an<00:04:35.430> ineffective<00:04:35.819> system<00:04:36.449> okay<00:04:37.139> in<00:04:37.560> fact<00:04:37.800> if

00:04:38.029 --> 00:04:38.039 
is an ineffective system okay in fact if

00:04:38.039 --> 00:04:39.890 
is an ineffective system okay in fact if
you<00:04:38.340> see<00:04:38.550> there<00:04:38.759> looks<00:04:38.969> like<00:04:39.090> there's<00:04:39.300> a<00:04:39.509> lot

00:04:39.890 --> 00:04:39.900 
you see there looks like there's a lot

00:04:39.900 --> 00:04:40.879 
you see there looks like there's a lot
of<00:04:40.020> beetles<00:04:40.289> in<00:04:40.379> here<00:04:40.530> but<00:04:40.680> there<00:04:40.800> really

00:04:40.879 --> 00:04:40.889 
of beetles in here but there really

00:04:40.889 --> 00:04:43.520 
of beetles in here but there really
isn't<00:04:41.129> I<00:04:42.120> need<00:04:42.479> about<00:04:42.599> 10<00:04:42.930> times<00:04:43.199> this<00:04:43.469> amount

00:04:43.520 --> 00:04:43.530 
isn't I need about 10 times this amount

00:04:43.530 --> 00:04:45.320 
isn't I need about 10 times this amount
of<00:04:43.860> beetles<00:04:44.159> for<00:04:44.370> this<00:04:44.490> to<00:04:44.639> really<00:04:44.819> be<00:04:44.939> an

00:04:45.320 --> 00:04:45.330 
of beetles for this to really be an

00:04:45.330 --> 00:04:48.640 
of beetles for this to really be an
effective<00:04:46.289> setup<00:04:46.710> and<00:04:46.889> I<00:04:47.639> have<00:04:48.090> a<00:04:48.120> lot<00:04:48.360> of

00:04:48.640 --> 00:04:48.650 
effective setup and I have a lot of

00:04:48.650 --> 00:04:51.649 
effective setup and I have a lot of
pupae<00:04:49.650> that<00:04:49.830> I'm<00:04:49.979> generating<00:04:50.849> right<00:04:51.150> now<00:04:51.330> and

00:04:51.649 --> 00:04:51.659 
pupae that I'm generating right now and

00:04:51.659 --> 00:04:53.659 
pupae that I'm generating right now and
you<00:04:52.439> can<00:04:52.590> go<00:04:52.680> back<00:04:52.830> in<00:04:52.979> my<00:04:53.069> other<00:04:53.189> videos<00:04:53.520> you

00:04:53.659 --> 00:04:53.669 
you can go back in my other videos you

00:04:53.669 --> 00:04:57.050 
you can go back in my other videos you
can<00:04:53.789> see<00:04:54.000> how<00:04:54.120> I<00:04:54.150> make<00:04:54.479> beetles<00:04:55.349> I<00:04:56.060> separate

00:04:57.050 --> 00:04:57.060 
can see how I make beetles I separate

00:04:57.060 --> 00:04:59.360 
can see how I make beetles I separate
the<00:04:57.270> worms<00:04:57.569> individually<00:04:58.439> in<00:04:58.620> two<00:04:58.860> ounce<00:04:59.069> deli

00:04:59.360 --> 00:04:59.370 
the worms individually in two ounce deli

00:04:59.370 --> 00:05:02.990 
the worms individually in two ounce deli
cups<00:04:59.719> with<00:05:00.719> a<00:05:00.750> little<00:05:01.050> hole<00:05:01.199> in<00:05:01.229> the<00:05:01.800> lid<00:05:01.979> and<00:05:02.280> I

00:05:02.990 --> 00:05:03.000 
cups with a little hole in the lid and I

00:05:03.000 --> 00:05:05.499 
cups with a little hole in the lid and I
leave<00:05:03.300> them<00:05:03.479> until<00:05:03.780> they<00:05:03.900> pupate<00:05:04.250> okay<00:05:05.250> and

00:05:05.499 --> 00:05:05.509 
leave them until they pupate okay and

00:05:05.509 --> 00:05:07.850 
leave them until they pupate okay and
until<00:05:06.509> they<00:05:06.599> turn<00:05:06.780> into<00:05:06.810> beetles<00:05:07.229> and<00:05:07.590> then<00:05:07.770> I

00:05:07.850 --> 00:05:07.860 
until they turn into beetles and then I

00:05:07.860 --> 00:05:09.740 
until they turn into beetles and then I
throw<00:05:08.039> the<00:05:08.159> beetles<00:05:08.460> in<00:05:08.610> here<00:05:08.849> and<00:05:09.030> all<00:05:09.599> I<00:05:09.690> do

00:05:09.740 --> 00:05:09.750 
throw the beetles in here and all I do

00:05:09.750 --> 00:05:12.020 
throw the beetles in here and all I do
is<00:05:09.870> feed<00:05:10.169> the<00:05:10.259> beetles<00:05:10.590> and<00:05:10.800> the<00:05:11.550> process

00:05:12.020 --> 00:05:12.030 
is feed the beetles and the process

00:05:12.030 --> 00:05:16.820 
is feed the beetles and the process
keeps<00:05:12.270> flowing<00:05:13.139> okay<00:05:14.270> so<00:05:15.289> once<00:05:16.289> you<00:05:16.409> get<00:05:16.620> it's

00:05:16.820 --> 00:05:16.830 
keeps flowing okay so once you get it's

00:05:16.830 --> 00:05:18.529 
keeps flowing okay so once you get it's
going<00:05:16.979> to<00:05:17.039> take<00:05:17.280> you<00:05:17.460> guys<00:05:17.669> a<00:05:17.729> while<00:05:18.210> to<00:05:18.419> get

00:05:18.529 --> 00:05:18.539 
going to take you guys a while to get

00:05:18.539 --> 00:05:21.800 
going to take you guys a while to get
started<00:05:18.740> but<00:05:19.740> once<00:05:20.370> this<00:05:20.639> system<00:05:21.029> starts

00:05:21.800 --> 00:05:21.810 
started but once this system starts

00:05:21.810 --> 00:05:24.499 
started but once this system starts
going<00:05:22.400> it's<00:05:23.400> really<00:05:23.520> effective<00:05:24.240> and<00:05:24.360> you're

00:05:24.499 --> 00:05:24.509 
going it's really effective and you're

00:05:24.509 --> 00:05:25.969 
going it's really effective and you're
going<00:05:24.629> to<00:05:24.689> save<00:05:24.870> yourself<00:05:24.900> money<00:05:25.439> but<00:05:25.740> like<00:05:25.830> I

00:05:25.969 --> 00:05:25.979 
going to save yourself money but like I

00:05:25.979 --> 00:05:28.399 
going to save yourself money but like I
said<00:05:26.039> it<00:05:26.340> is<00:05:26.460> a<00:05:26.490> chore<00:05:26.849> it<00:05:27.060> is<00:05:27.180> gross<00:05:27.479> I<00:05:27.779> do<00:05:28.259> I

00:05:28.399 --> 00:05:28.409 
said it is a chore it is gross I do I

00:05:28.409 --> 00:05:30.350 
said it is a chore it is gross I do I
keep<00:05:28.770> these<00:05:28.949> in<00:05:29.159> my<00:05:29.279> garage<00:05:29.430> it<00:05:29.909> gets<00:05:30.060> to<00:05:30.240> be

00:05:30.350 --> 00:05:30.360 
keep these in my garage it gets to be

00:05:30.360 --> 00:05:32.719 
keep these in my garage it gets to be
like<00:05:30.509> 100<00:05:30.930> degrees<00:05:31.020> in<00:05:31.349> my<00:05:31.440> garage<00:05:31.620> during<00:05:32.610> the

00:05:32.719 --> 00:05:32.729 
like 100 degrees in my garage during the

00:05:32.729 --> 00:05:34.850 
like 100 degrees in my garage during the
summer<00:05:32.969> and<00:05:33.210> that's<00:05:34.139> actually<00:05:34.349> really<00:05:34.770> good

00:05:34.850 --> 00:05:34.860 
summer and that's actually really good

00:05:34.860 --> 00:05:38.119 
summer and that's actually really good
for<00:05:35.569> these<00:05:36.569> species<00:05:36.960> and<00:05:37.500> it's<00:05:37.710> also<00:05:37.830> good<00:05:38.099> for

00:05:38.119 --> 00:05:38.129 
for these species and it's also good for

00:05:38.129 --> 00:05:40.779 
for these species and it's also good for
roaches<00:05:38.430> if<00:05:38.909> you<00:05:39.150> plan<00:05:39.419> on<00:05:39.449> breeding<00:05:39.840> roaches

00:05:40.779 --> 00:05:40.789 
roaches if you plan on breeding roaches

00:05:40.789 --> 00:05:43.550 
roaches if you plan on breeding roaches
dubia<00:05:41.789> roaches<00:05:41.849> are<00:05:42.330> awesome<00:05:42.810> for<00:05:42.839> geckos<00:05:43.319> and

00:05:43.550 --> 00:05:43.560 
dubia roaches are awesome for geckos and

00:05:43.560 --> 00:05:46.219 
dubia roaches are awesome for geckos and
are<00:05:44.490> so<00:05:44.759> easy<00:05:45.029> to<00:05:45.210> breed<00:05:45.479> they're<00:05:45.690> even<00:05:45.930> easier

00:05:46.219 --> 00:05:46.229 
are so easy to breed they're even easier

00:05:46.229 --> 00:05:49.399 
are so easy to breed they're even easier
to<00:05:46.289> breathe<00:05:46.529> than<00:05:46.740> these<00:05:46.860> things<00:05:47.099> so<00:05:47.969> and<00:05:48.419> they

00:05:49.399 --> 00:05:49.409 
to breathe than these things so and they

00:05:49.409 --> 00:05:51.320 
to breathe than these things so and they
can't<00:05:49.680> get<00:05:49.830> out<00:05:49.889> they<00:05:50.250> can't<00:05:50.460> escape<00:05:50.699> a<00:05:51.060> tub

00:05:51.320 --> 00:05:51.330 
can't get out they can't escape a tub

00:05:51.330 --> 00:05:53.689 
can't get out they can't escape a tub
like<00:05:51.360> this<00:05:51.569> they<00:05:52.379> can't<00:05:52.620> climb<00:05:52.860> plastic<00:05:53.460> so

00:05:53.689 --> 00:05:53.699 
like this they can't climb plastic so

00:05:53.699 --> 00:05:55.909 
like this they can't climb plastic so
you're<00:05:54.509> pretty<00:05:54.750> much<00:05:54.870> safe<00:05:55.139> and<00:05:55.409> Plus<00:05:55.589> even<00:05:55.800> if

00:05:55.909 --> 00:05:55.919 
you're pretty much safe and Plus even if

00:05:55.919 --> 00:05:57.709 
you're pretty much safe and Plus even if
a<00:05:56.039> few<00:05:56.219> did<00:05:56.400> get<00:05:56.550> out<00:05:56.669> they're<00:05:57.000> not<00:05:57.180> invasive

00:05:57.709 --> 00:05:57.719 
a few did get out they're not invasive

00:05:57.719 --> 00:06:00.529 
a few did get out they're not invasive
where<00:05:58.680> they<00:05:58.830> can<00:05:59.069> you<00:05:59.819> know<00:05:59.909> take<00:06:00.150> over<00:06:00.419> your

00:06:00.529 --> 00:06:00.539 
where they can you know take over your

00:06:00.539 --> 00:06:02.899 
where they can you know take over your
house<00:06:00.690> like<00:06:01.110> you<00:06:01.409> know<00:06:01.979> some<00:06:02.279> Roach<00:06:02.460> species

00:06:02.899 --> 00:06:02.909 
house like you know some Roach species

00:06:02.909 --> 00:06:05.269
