your<00:01:53.820> eggs<00:01:54.000> and<00:01:54.799> then<00:01:55.799> add<00:01:55.979> one<00:01:56.219> egg<00:01:56.369> at<00:01:56.520> a<00:01:56.610> time

00:01:56.630 --> 00:01:56.640 
your eggs and then add one egg at a time

00:01:56.640 --> 00:01:58.550 
your eggs and then add one egg at a time
making<00:01:57.090> sure<00:01:57.240> that<00:01:57.659> the<00:01:57.899> other<00:01:57.930> egg<00:01:58.409> is

incorporated before you add the next one
and<00:02:01.740> here<00:02:01.890> I<00:02:01.950> use<00:02:02.009> 3<00:02:02.490> eggs<00:02:02.520> internal<00:02:03.119> just

00:02:03.319 --> 00:02:03.329

course and then wet your fingers and
just<00:02:28.960> push<00:02:29.620> those<00:02:29.860> Peaks<00:02:30.250> down<00:02:30.550> and<00:02:30.880> the<00:02:31.300> water

00:02:31.410 --> 00:02:31.420 
just push those Peaks down and the water

00:02:31.420 --> 00:02:33.110 
just push those Peaks down and the water
helps<00:02:31.780> them<00:02:31.870> not<00:02:31.990> to<00:02:32.110> stick<00:02:32.320> to<00:02:32.440> your<00:02:32.560> finger

each oven is different you might find

00:02:46.660 --> 00:02:48.450 
each oven is different you might find

consistency<00:03:20.910> I'm<00:03:21.910> gonna<00:03:22.060> fold<00:03:22.360> through<00:03:22.810> a

00:03:23.130 --> 00:03:23.140 
consistency I'm gonna fold through a

00:03:23.140 --> 00:03:24.540 
consistency I'm gonna fold through a
little<00:03:23.470> bit<00:03:23.560> of<00:03:23.769> that<00:03:23.980> cream<00:03:24.280> and<00:03:24.489> I've

little bit of that cream and I've
divided<00:03:24.850> the<00:03:25.030> cream<00:03:25.269> in<00:03:25.420> half<00:03:25.600> half<00:03:25.989> I'm<00:03:26.350> gonna

00:03:26.580 --> 00:03:26.590 
divided the cream in half half I'm gonna

00:03:26.590 --> 00:03:28.710 
divided the cream in half half I'm gonna
put<00:03:26.860> into<00:03:27.010> the<00:03:27.250> chocolate<00:03:27.640> custard<00:03:28.239> and<00:03:28.570> half

00:03:28.710 --> 00:03:28.720 
put into the chocolate custard and half

00:03:28.720 --> 00:03:30.410 
put into the chocolate custard and half
I'm<00:03:28.840> gonna<00:03:28.989> put<00:03:29.140> into<00:03:29.260> the<00:03:29.380> vanilla<00:03:29.650> custard
