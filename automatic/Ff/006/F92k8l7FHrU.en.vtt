00:00:06.040 --> 00:00:12.710
Essentially, the Search for God has two primary
aspects -- attunement within and service

00:00:12.710 --> 00:00:14.840
outward into the world.

00:00:14.840 --> 00:00:20.450
In this lesson we will focus on attunement,
which in the simplest possible terms, consists

00:00:20.450 --> 00:00:23.130
of prayer and meditation.

00:00:23.130 --> 00:00:28.920
Prayer has been defined as talking to God
whereas meditation is listening for God.

00:00:28.920 --> 00:00:33.930
Both prayer and meditation can be either an
individual or group experience.

00:00:33.930 --> 00:00:39.800
They can be combined in a conversational way
so as to allow a dialogue with God, if that

00:00:39.800 --> 00:00:41.430
is desired.

00:00:41.430 --> 00:00:48.490
Prayer may take on the form of praise, thanksgiving,
submission, petition, a request for guidance

00:00:48.490 --> 00:00:53.660
or forgiveness, or for intercession on behalf
of others.

00:00:53.660 --> 00:00:59.470
Meditation as an aid or method for spiritual
awakening has a long and varied history.

00:00:59.470 --> 00:01:05.509
Whether the yogic practices of Hindus, the
contemplation of Buddhist or Christian monks,

00:01:05.509 --> 00:01:11.410
the whirling dervishes of Muslim Suffis, varied
meditative techniques and practices have been

00:01:11.410 --> 00:01:13.610
used for inner attunement.

00:01:13.610 --> 00:01:19.130
Indigenous peoples from around the world have
used rituals and visioning to alter consciousness

00:01:19.130 --> 00:01:25.260
and attune to the unseen realm of spirit -- bringing
that inner experience back into the community

00:01:25.260 --> 00:01:28.409
or tribal setting in some useful way.

00:01:28.409 --> 00:01:33.700
Thus there are many ways and traditions for
achieving inner attunement and making it practical

00:01:33.700 --> 00:01:35.080
in daily life.

00:01:35.080 --> 00:01:40.520
The exercises for this lesson will provide
detailed recommendations on how to use prayer

00:01:40.520 --> 00:01:43.030
and meditation for attunement based on the
Cayce readings.

00:01:43.030 --> 00:01:48.820
However first let's lay a conceptual foundation
so that we can appreciate the meaning of attunement

00:01:48.820 --> 00:02:01.400
with relation to the soul, and how the
soul manifests in a material body.

00:02:01.400 --> 00:02:06.750
With respect to our Search for God, spiritual
attunement is the means by which the soul

00:02:06.750 --> 00:02:09.720
maintains its connection to its Source.

00:02:09.720 --> 00:02:14.549
We will be considering the creation story
provided in the Cayce readings in many of

00:02:14.549 --> 00:02:16.219
the lessons that follow.

00:02:16.219 --> 00:02:22.659
For now, the important point is that we recognize
the origin and destiny of the soul.

00:02:22.659 --> 00:02:28.499
Each soul was created in the beginning to
be a co-creative companion with God.

00:02:28.499 --> 00:02:33.030
With spiritual rebellion came the soul's
journey through materiality.

00:02:33.030 --> 00:02:39.299
Thus each soul is making its way through eternity,
finding its way back to its source.

00:02:39.299 --> 00:02:45.430
During the soul's journey through materiality,
attunement, through prayer and mediation especially,

00:02:45.430 --> 00:02:50.730
provides a means for communion with God, for
maintaining a conscious connection with the Source.

00:02:51.730 --> 00:02:58.569
For the soul, life on earth is a three-dimensional
experience, not only in spatial dimensions,

00:02:58.569 --> 00:03:00.870
but in consciousness as well.

00:03:00.870 --> 00:03:05.700
Thus we tend to perceive and conceptualize
in triune patterns.

00:03:05.700 --> 00:03:11.260
With regard to the incarnation of the soul
in a material body, the essential triune is

00:03:11.260 --> 00:03:15.199
that of physical, mental, and spiritual.

00:03:15.199 --> 00:03:21.309
These are one in the physical body and yet
we can analyze each aspect of the triune,

00:03:21.309 --> 00:03:25.799
body-soul connection -- in terms of anatomy and physiology.

00:03:25.799 --> 00:03:30.669
This connection provides the soul with the
means to function in a material world and

00:03:30.669 --> 00:03:34.389
yet maintain its association with the realm
of spirit.

00:03:34.389 --> 00:03:37.339
The physical aspect is readily apparent.

00:03:37.339 --> 00:03:41.309
It is the flesh and bones of our musculo-skeletal
system.

00:03:41.309 --> 00:03:46.829
It is the vital internal organs (such as
the heart and lungs; liver and kidneys) that

00:03:46.829 --> 00:03:52.620
keep us alive from moment to moment and sustain
the physical body throughout its lifespan.

00:03:52.620 --> 00:03:58.040
The mental aspect of the body-soul connection
manifests through the nervous systems of the body.

00:03:59.040 --> 00:04:03.879
This is not so strange considering that modern
neuroscience recognizes that mental functioning

00:04:03.879 --> 00:04:07.519
is associated with the activity of nerve cells.

00:04:07.519 --> 00:04:11.930
There are some important distinctions, however,
that must be made.

00:04:11.930 --> 00:04:16.949
Neuroscience tends to focus almost exclusively
on the brain as the source of the mind.

00:04:16.949 --> 00:04:21.270
The brain is NOT the mind -- the mind uses
the brain.

00:04:21.270 --> 00:04:26.600
Furthermore, the mind uses other nerve centers
throughout the body, and especially along

00:04:26.600 --> 00:04:28.970
the spine and in the abdomen.

00:04:28.970 --> 00:04:33.950
The spiritual aspect of the body-soul connection
manifests through the glands of the system.

00:04:33.950 --> 00:04:37.030
Specifically, with regard to the manifestation
of the soul -- that individualized expression

00:04:37.030 --> 00:04:38.030
of spirit -- the primary interface in the
physical body is the endocrine system.

00:04:38.030 --> 00:04:42.700
Endocrine glands secrete hormones directly
into the circulation for distribution to the

00:04:42.700 --> 00:04:44.190
entire body.

00:04:44.190 --> 00:04:49.930
The endocrine glands are sometimes referred
to as spiritual centers within the body.

00:04:49.930 --> 00:04:55.650
There are two very special endocrine glands
that deserve our attention: The Leydig gland

00:04:55.650 --> 00:05:00.540
(also sometimes called the lyden); and the
pineal gland.

00:05:00.540 --> 00:05:06.200
In the Cayce readings these glands are called
the seat of the soul in the body.

00:05:06.200 --> 00:05:11.320
Now that we have covered the basic anatomy
of the body-soul connection, let's consider

00:05:11.320 --> 00:05:17.600
physiology -- or the way these anatomical
structures FUNCTION as the body-soul connection,

00:05:17.600 --> 00:05:22.060
and especially their significance during deep
meditation.

00:05:22.060 --> 00:05:25.070
Spirit is the life or lifeforce in the body.

00:05:25.070 --> 00:05:31.060
It is a low electrical vibration that operates
at a cellular level to reproduce and regenerate

00:05:31.060 --> 00:05:32.430
the system.

00:05:32.430 --> 00:05:38.640
However this Creative Energy, which is synonymous
with God in a material sense, can be raised

00:05:38.640 --> 00:05:45.760
in its intensity, resulting in altered consciousness,
powerful healing effects, and increased creativity

00:05:45.760 --> 00:05:46.760
and productivity.

00:05:46.760 --> 00:05:53.510
Or, if the energy is misused or misdirected,
it can have powerful pathological effects.

00:05:53.510 --> 00:05:59.530
At this higher level of intensity the Creative
Energy is sometimes called Kundalini, in reference

00:05:59.530 --> 00:06:05.960
to the practice of kundalini yoga or kundalini
meditation, a traditional approach to working

00:06:05.960 --> 00:06:08.500
with this potent force.

00:06:08.500 --> 00:06:12.990
With the opening of the spiritual centers,
and especially the closed door of the Leydig

00:06:12.990 --> 00:06:18.840
gland, this kundalini energy moves upward
along the spine to the pineal gland in the

00:06:18.840 --> 00:06:20.500
center of the brain.

00:06:20.500 --> 00:06:26.120
As it moves along the spine it is distributed
through certain key nerves plexuses and to

00:06:26.120 --> 00:06:31.060
the endocrine glands that we have described
previously as spiritual centers.

00:06:31.060 --> 00:06:36.670
In the eastern spiritual traditions, the interaction
of kundalini energy through the nerves and

00:06:36.670 --> 00:06:42.400
gland centers has been witnessed by adepts
with psychic vision who have designated these

00:06:42.400 --> 00:06:45.840
whirling vortexes of energy as chakras.

00:06:45.840 --> 00:06:51.450
The Cayce readings assert that this kundalini,
lifeforce energy, moving through these centers,

00:06:51.450 --> 00:06:56.090
is responsible for the development of the
fetus in the womb of the mother during pregnancy.

00:06:56.090 --> 00:07:02.630
Thus, when the kundalini is activated during
deep meditation, the primal pattern of creation

00:07:02.630 --> 00:07:07.570
is again taking place within the inner self
-- the soul in its connection with the physical

00:07:07.570 --> 00:07:08.700
body.

00:07:08.700 --> 00:07:13.110
The creative energy that formed the body is
accessible for regeneration.

00:07:13.110 --> 00:07:18.430
Therefore, the potential for healing -- of
self and others -- is available to those

00:07:18.430 --> 00:07:22.280
who know how to use deep meditation for this
purpose.

00:07:22.280 --> 00:07:26.930
The raising of this lifeforce energy also
provides a channel for communion with the

00:07:26.930 --> 00:07:28.380
divine within.

00:07:28.380 --> 00:07:34.810
In meditation, the physical, mental, and spiritual
dimensions of the soul entity are brought

00:07:34.810 --> 00:07:37.630
into attunement with their Source.

00:07:37.630 --> 00:07:43.160
Persons practicing deep meditation sometimes
report mystical encounters with God -- of

00:07:43.160 --> 00:07:46.440
being in the presence of the divine.

00:07:46.440 --> 00:07:51.810
In the application portion associated with
this section you will be encouraged to practice

00:07:51.810 --> 00:07:58.120
some basic forms of meditation for guidance,
mindfulness, and communion with God.
