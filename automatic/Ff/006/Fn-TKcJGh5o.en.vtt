00:02:07.020 --> 00:02:07.030 
scenes at the beginning had a really

00:02:07.030 --> 00:02:08.999 
scenes at the beginning had a really
tense<00:02:07.240> feeling<00:02:07.659> but<00:02:08.110> there<00:02:08.410> were<00:02:08.560> two<00:02:08.769> scenes

00:02:08.999 --> 00:02:09.009 
tense feeling but there were two scenes

00:02:09.009 --> 00:02:11.309 
tense feeling but there were two scenes
that<00:02:09.250> bugged<00:02:09.519> me<00:02:09.670> one<00:02:10.330> is<00:02:10.660> the<00:02:10.810> opening<00:02:11.140> scene

00:02:11.309 --> 00:02:11.319

that bugged me one is the opening scene
with<00:02:11.500> the<00:02:11.590> shadows<00:02:12.010> it<00:02:12.580> was<00:02:12.700> impressive<00:02:12.910> that

00:02:13.199 --> 00:02:13.209 
with the shadows it was impressive that

00:02:13.209 --> 00:02:14.640 
with the shadows it was impressive that
they<00:02:13.330> pulled<00:02:13.510> something<00:02:13.690> off<00:02:13.900> like<00:02:14.140> this<00:02:14.379> but

00:02:14.640 --> 00:02:14.650 
they pulled something off like this but

00:02:14.650 --> 00:02:16.800 
they pulled something off like this but
the<00:02:15.310> comedic<00:02:15.670> effect<00:02:15.879> of<00:02:16.209> the<00:02:16.299> scene<00:02:16.540> is

00:02:16.800 --> 00:02:16.810 
the comedic effect of the scene is

00:02:16.810 --> 00:02:18.839 
the comedic effect of the scene is
ruined<00:02:17.200> by<00:02:17.290> the<00:02:17.349> reaction<00:02:17.890> plus<00:02:18.310> the<00:02:18.580> shadow

00:02:18.839 --> 00:02:18.849 
ruined by the reaction plus the shadow

00:02:18.849 --> 00:02:20.759 
ruined by the reaction plus the shadow
to<00:02:19.480> be<00:02:19.599> honest<00:02:19.900> lack<00:02:20.140> of<00:02:20.290> shadow<00:02:20.470> would<00:02:20.680> have

00:02:20.759 --> 00:02:20.769 
to be honest lack of shadow would have

00:02:20.769 --> 00:02:22.949 
to be honest lack of shadow would have
worked<00:02:20.950> better<00:02:21.099> the<00:02:21.819> other<00:02:21.940> issue<00:02:22.180> I<00:02:22.299> have<00:02:22.690> is

00:02:25.060 --> 00:02:27.570 
the tone shift don't get me wrong it's
well<00:02:25.239> designed<00:02:25.629> but<00:02:25.959> the<00:02:26.500> lead-up<00:02:26.799> to<00:02:26.950> it<00:02:27.310> was

00:02:27.570 --> 00:02:27.580 
well designed but the lead-up to it was

00:02:27.580 --> 00:02:29.789 
well designed but the lead-up to it was
