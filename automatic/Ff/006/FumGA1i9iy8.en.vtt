00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.810
 hello and welcome to life tech de 

00:00:01.770 --> 00:00:06.299
 Today I have the unboxing video one 

00:00:03.810 --> 00:00:12.330
 external hard drive with 500GB memory 

00:00:06.299 --> 00:00:14.340
 from toshiba the story basic is for you 

00:00:12.330 --> 00:00:15.599
 an external hard drive from toshiba and 

00:00:14.340 --> 00:00:17.670
 comes in a relatively simple way 

00:00:15.599 --> 00:00:19.230
 packaging on the front one sees 

00:00:17.670 --> 00:00:21.060
 a picture of the hard disk with the 

00:00:19.230 --> 00:00:23.039
 Memory size of 500 gigabytes 

00:00:21.060 --> 00:00:25.019
 the back of the box provides more 

00:00:23.039 --> 00:00:26.400
 However, information about the hard disk 

00:00:25.019 --> 00:00:28.140
 the content of the box is likely 

00:00:26.400 --> 00:00:29.699
 much more interesting to the box too 

00:00:28.140 --> 00:00:31.289
 you just have to open up the plastic 

00:00:29.699 --> 00:00:31.890
 peel off the seal and the tab 

00:00:31.289 --> 00:00:33.270
 to open 

00:00:31.890 --> 00:00:34.770
 in the pack is a 

00:00:33.270 --> 00:00:35.700
 another carton of the protection of 

00:00:34.770 --> 00:00:37.800
 hard disk is used 

00:00:35.700 --> 00:00:40.200
 there we also find a usb 3.0 

00:00:37.800 --> 00:00:41.250
 cable if you can open the carton 

00:00:40.200 --> 00:00:42.690
 you also have a look at the 

00:00:41.250 --> 00:00:45.090
 hard disk throw one 

00:00:42.690 --> 00:00:46.469
 matt black color has also been found 

00:00:45.090 --> 00:00:48.450
 in the pack a few more notes 

00:00:46.469 --> 00:00:48.989
 further information about hard disk 

00:00:48.450 --> 00:00:50.789
 give 

00:00:48.989 --> 00:00:53.190
 the hard drive is in a lot of memory 

00:00:50.789 --> 00:00:54.360
 variants which from 500 gb to 2 

00:00:53.190 --> 00:00:56.309
 terabytes are enough 

00:00:54.360 --> 00:00:58.559
 In addition, the hard disk has like one 

00:00:56.309 --> 00:01:01.230
 due to the enclosed usb 3.0 cable 

00:00:58.559 --> 00:01:02.430
 could suspect a usb 3.0 connection 

00:01:01.230 --> 00:01:05.309
 which much faster 

00:01:02.430 --> 00:01:06.840
 Data transfer enabled as usb 2.0 

00:01:05.309 --> 00:01:08.640
 to secure the hard disk to the hard drive 

00:01:06.840 --> 00:01:10.170
 desktop or pc 

00:01:08.640 --> 00:01:12.240
 are located at the bottom of the 

00:01:10.170 --> 00:01:13.979
 hard disk small gumminoppen these 

00:01:12.240 --> 00:01:14.790
 offer something more halt on slippery 

00:01:13.979 --> 00:01:17.189
 surface 

00:01:14.790 --> 00:01:19.080
 i am currently using this disk as 

00:01:17.189 --> 00:01:20.100
 backup memory and had so far no 

00:01:19.080 --> 00:01:22.020
 problems with her 

00:01:20.100 --> 00:01:23.850
 she does exactly what she should do 

00:01:22.020 --> 00:01:25.380
 save and enable it quickly 

00:01:23.850 --> 00:01:26.939
 to push data back and forth 

00:01:25.380 --> 00:01:29.250
 She also has a prize 

00:01:26.939 --> 00:01:30.630
 between 40 and 50 euros a pretty good 

00:01:29.250 --> 00:01:32.189
 price-performance ratio 

00:01:30.630 --> 00:01:34.530
 that's why i can only use the hard disk 

00:01:32.189 --> 00:01:36.329
 I recommend this video 

00:01:34.530 --> 00:01:37.979
