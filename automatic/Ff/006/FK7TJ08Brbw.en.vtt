00:02:08.489 --> 00:02:11.680 
lowering it i want to make these
computers<00:02:08.970> as<00:02:09.090> bad<00:02:09.330> as<00:02:09.539> possible

00:02:11.680 --> 00:02:11.690 
computers as bad as possible

00:02:11.690 --> 00:02:13.390 
computers as bad as possible
so<00:02:12.350> let's<00:02:12.500> see<00:02:12.620> how<00:02:12.650> because<00:02:12.980> I<00:02:13.040> think<00:02:13.220> in<00:02:13.310> this

00:02:37.960 --> 00:02:37.970 
so sure about the screen effect I don't

00:02:37.970 --> 00:02:39.280 
so sure about the screen effect I don't
know<00:02:38.030> if<00:02:38.120> I<00:02:38.180> want<00:02:38.330> that<00:02:38.390> up<00:02:38.540> or<00:02:38.690> down<00:02:38.870> so<00:02:39.170> I'm

00:02:39.280 --> 00:02:39.290 
know if I want that up or down so I'm

00:02:39.290 --> 00:02:41.560 
know if I want that up or down so I'm
just<00:02:39.410> gonna<00:02:39.500> put<00:02:40.400> my<00:02:40.610> reflexes<00:02:41.180> up<00:02:41.330> and

00:02:41.560 --> 00:02:41.570 
just gonna put my reflexes up and

00:02:41.570 --> 00:02:45.910 
just gonna put my reflexes up and
there's<00:02:41.810> damn<00:02:43.960> so<00:02:44.960> let's<00:02:45.140> press<00:02:45.380> B<00:02:45.650> and

00:02:45.910 --> 00:02:45.920 
there's damn so let's press B and

00:02:45.920 --> 00:02:48.850 
there's damn so let's press B and
everything<00:02:46.580> will<00:02:46.670> save<00:02:46.880> automatically<00:02:47.860> so

00:02:48.850 --> 00:02:48.860 
everything will save automatically so

00:02:48.860 --> 00:02:50.800 
everything will save automatically so
I'll<00:02:48.980> be<00:02:49.130> focusing<00:02:49.310> on<00:02:49.850> the<00:02:50.060> shutout<00:02:50.330> third

00:02:50.800 --> 00:02:50.810 
I'll be focusing on the shutout third

00:02:50.810 --> 00:02:52.690 
I'll be focusing on the shutout third
period<00:02:51.110> so<00:02:51.560> let's<00:02:51.740> simulate<00:02:51.950> the<00:02:52.340> first<00:02:52.550> two

00:02:52.690 --> 00:02:52.700 
period so let's simulate the first two

00:02:52.700 --> 00:02:54.520 
period so let's simulate the first two
periods<00:02:52.970> and<00:02:53.360> not<00:02:53.780> let<00:02:53.960> up<00:02:54.080> a<00:02:54.170> goal<00:02:54.320> in<00:02:54.410> the

00:02:54.520 --> 00:02:54.530 
periods and not let up a goal in the

00:02:54.530 --> 00:02:57.940 
periods and not let up a goal in the
third<00:02:55.660> so<00:02:56.660> the<00:02:56.780> game<00:02:56.960> was<00:02:57.110> tied<00:02:57.140> one<00:02:57.590> nothing

00:02:57.940 --> 00:02:57.950 
third so the game was tied one nothing

00:02:57.950 --> 00:02:59.590 
third so the game was tied one nothing
heading<00:02:58.190> to<00:02:58.310> the<00:02:58.400> third<00:02:58.430> it's<00:02:59.180> okay<00:02:59.450> if<00:02:59.480> you

00:02:59.590 --> 00:02:59.600 
heading to the third it's okay if you

00:02:59.600 --> 00:03:01.030 
heading to the third it's okay if you
don't<00:02:59.720> want<00:02:59.810> every<00:03:00.110> round<00:03:00.290> robin<00:03:00.680> game<00:03:00.860> is

00:03:01.030 --> 00:03:01.040 
don't want every round robin game is

00:03:01.040 --> 00:03:03.250 
don't want every round robin game is
make<00:03:01.220> sure<00:03:01.370> you<00:03:01.490> playing<00:03:01.850> all<00:03:02.090> them<00:03:02.360> and<00:03:02.570> even

00:03:03.250 --> 00:03:03.260 
make sure you playing all them and even

00:03:03.260 --> 00:03:04.390 
make sure you playing all them and even
though<00:03:03.350> we're<00:03:03.470> only<00:03:03.500> playing<00:03:03.950> the<00:03:04.100> third

00:03:04.390 --> 00:03:04.400 
though we're only playing the third

00:03:04.400 --> 00:03:06.310 
though we're only playing the third
period<00:03:04.700> this<00:03:05.090> does<00:03:05.390> count<00:03:05.690> as<00:03:05.780> a<00:03:05.840> game<00:03:06.050> played

00:03:06.310 --> 00:03:06.320 
period this does count as a game played

00:03:06.320 --> 00:03:09.070 
period this does count as a game played
and<00:03:06.670> also<00:03:07.670> make<00:03:07.910> sure<00:03:07.940> you<00:03:08.120> win<00:03:08.390> the<00:03:08.510> Memorial

00:03:09.070 --> 00:03:09.080 
and also make sure you win the Memorial

00:03:09.080 --> 00:03:10.840 
and also make sure you win the Memorial
Cup<00:03:09.290> final<00:03:09.830> because<00:03:10.070> one<00:03:10.370> of<00:03:10.400> the<00:03:10.520> unlocks

00:03:10.840 --> 00:03:10.850 
Cup final because one of the unlocks

00:03:10.850 --> 00:03:14.050 
Cup final because one of the unlocks
requires<00:03:11.300> a<00:03:11.480> shut<00:03:11.840> out<00:03:11.900> in<00:03:12.170> the<00:03:12.260> final<00:03:12.850> as<00:03:13.850> you

00:03:14.050 --> 00:03:14.060 
requires a shut out in the final as you

00:03:14.060 --> 00:03:15.340 
requires a shut out in the final as you
can<00:03:14.180> probably<00:03:14.420> tell<00:03:14.570> from<00:03:14.750> looking<00:03:15.050> at<00:03:15.230> the

00:03:15.340 --> 00:03:15.350 
can probably tell from looking at the

00:03:15.350 --> 00:03:17.080 
can probably tell from looking at the
computers<00:03:15.800> it<00:03:16.160> looks<00:03:16.459> like<00:03:16.520> there's<00:03:16.790> kidding

00:03:17.080 --> 00:03:17.090 
computers it looks like there's kidding

00:03:17.090 --> 00:03:19.960 
computers it looks like there's kidding
in<00:03:17.180> slow<00:03:17.390> motion<00:03:17.630> the<00:03:18.470> pass<00:03:18.709> is<00:03:18.739> ur<00:03:19.010> and<00:03:19.489> shots

00:03:19.960 --> 00:03:19.970 
in slow motion the pass is ur and shots

00:03:19.970 --> 00:03:23.350 
in slow motion the pass is ur and shots
are<00:03:20.239> slower<00:03:20.570> and<00:03:20.989> less<00:03:21.590> accurate<00:03:22.160> and<00:03:22.370> you<00:03:23.209> can

00:03:23.350 --> 00:03:23.360 
are slower and less accurate and you can

00:03:23.360 --> 00:03:25.720 
are slower and less accurate and you can
probably<00:03:23.570> see<00:03:23.840> how<00:03:23.989> how<00:03:24.920> much<00:03:25.070> easier<00:03:25.310> it<00:03:25.580> is

00:03:25.720 --> 00:03:25.730 
probably see how how much easier it is

00:03:25.730 --> 00:03:27.190 
probably see how how much easier it is
to<00:03:25.790> get<00:03:26.060> those<00:03:26.239> boots<00:03:26.540> that<00:03:26.810> requires

00:03:27.190 --> 00:03:27.200 
to get those boots that requires

00:03:27.200 --> 00:03:30.280 
to get those boots that requires
shutouts<00:03:27.650> now<00:03:28.150> so<00:03:29.150> luckily<00:03:29.510> the<00:03:29.780> computers

00:03:30.280 --> 00:03:30.290 
shutouts now so luckily the computers

the<00:03:40.760> computers<00:03:41.360> there<00:03:42.080> you<00:03:42.140> go<00:03:42.230> force<00:03:42.530> that

00:03:42.640 --> 00:03:42.650 
the computers there you go force that

00:04:05.140 --> 00:04:05.150 
and take over from the third if the

00:04:05.150 --> 00:04:06.670 
and take over from the third if the
simulation<00:04:05.690> doesn't<00:04:06.080> give<00:04:06.170> us<00:04:06.320> a<00:04:06.440> shutout

00:04:06.670 --> 00:04:06.680 
simulation doesn't give us a shutout

00:04:06.680 --> 00:04:09.040 
simulation doesn't give us a shutout
opportunity<00:04:07.430> don't<00:04:07.910> worry<00:04:08.120> just<00:04:08.810> send<00:04:09.019> the

00:04:09.040 --> 00:04:09.050 
opportunity don't worry just send the

opportunity don't worry just send the
rest<00:04:09.230> of<00:04:09.380> the<00:04:09.440> game<00:04:09.620> what<00:04:10.370> we're<00:04:10.489> going<00:04:10.640> to<00:04:10.820> do

00:04:10.930 --> 00:04:10.940 
rest of the game what we're going to do

00:04:10.940 --> 00:04:13.180 
rest of the game what we're going to do
is<00:04:11.120> exit<00:04:11.570> live<00:04:11.720> the<00:04:11.900> life<00:04:12.080> and<00:04:12.380> reload<00:04:12.920> our

00:04:13.180 --> 00:04:13.190 
is exit live the life and reload our

00:04:13.190 --> 00:04:16.360 
is exit live the life and reload our
last<00:04:13.430> save<00:04:13.760> I<00:04:14.290> suggest<00:04:15.290> you<00:04:15.410> do<00:04:15.590> a<00:04:15.620> manual<00:04:15.920> save

00:04:16.360 --> 00:04:16.370 
last save I suggest you do a manual save

00:04:16.370 --> 00:04:18.430 
last save I suggest you do a manual save
but<00:04:16.640> in<00:04:16.730> this<00:04:16.850> case<00:04:17.090> I<00:04:17.330> can<00:04:17.480> use<00:04:17.600> autosave<00:04:18.169> to

00:04:18.430 --> 00:04:18.440 
but in this case I can use autosave to

00:04:18.440 --> 00:04:20.380 
but in this case I can use autosave to
as<00:04:18.650> it<00:04:19.220> usually<00:04:19.340> gives<00:04:19.700> you<00:04:19.850> the<00:04:19.970> file<00:04:20.180> to

00:04:20.380 --> 00:04:20.390 
as it usually gives you the file to

00:04:20.390 --> 00:04:21.879 
as it usually gives you the file to
replay<00:04:20.720> the<00:04:20.870> last<00:04:20.900> game

00:04:21.879 --> 00:04:21.889 
replay the last game

00:04:21.889 --> 00:04:23.709 
replay the last game
if<00:04:22.460> your<00:04:22.610> team<00:04:22.789> plays<00:04:22.999> ball<00:04:23.240> enough<00:04:23.449> to<00:04:23.569> win

00:04:23.709 --> 00:04:23.719 
if your team plays ball enough to win

00:04:23.719 --> 00:04:24.969 
if your team plays ball enough to win
the<00:04:23.749> memorial<00:04:24.199> cup<00:04:24.379> and<00:04:24.620> you<00:04:24.710> get<00:04:24.860> some

00:04:24.969 --> 00:04:24.979 
the memorial cup and you get some

00:04:24.979 --> 00:04:27.189 
the memorial cup and you get some
shutouts<00:04:25.400> getting<00:04:26.180> drafted<00:04:26.569> in<00:04:26.689> the<00:04:26.719> top<00:04:26.930> ten

00:04:27.189 --> 00:04:27.199 
shutouts getting drafted in the top ten

00:04:27.199 --> 00:04:28.390 
shutouts getting drafted in the top ten
shouldn't<00:04:27.530> be<00:04:27.590> a<00:04:27.620> problem<00:04:27.949> so<00:04:28.219> there's

00:04:28.390 --> 00:04:28.400 
shouldn't be a problem so there's

00:04:28.400 --> 00:04:30.730 
shouldn't be a problem so there's
another<00:04:28.580> boost<00:04:28.849> right<00:04:29.030> there<00:04:29.740> remember

00:04:30.730 --> 00:04:30.740 
another boost right there remember

00:04:30.740 --> 00:04:32.230 
another boost right there remember
you're<00:04:30.889> most<00:04:31.069> likely<00:04:31.340> going<00:04:31.639> to<00:04:31.729> be<00:04:31.819> a<00:04:31.909> backup

00:04:32.230 --> 00:04:32.240 
you're most likely going to be a backup

00:04:32.240 --> 00:04:34.300 
you're most likely going to be a backup
in<00:04:32.539> the<00:04:32.629> NHL<00:04:33.080> squad<00:04:33.379> so<00:04:33.620> you<00:04:33.680> won't<00:04:33.979> get<00:04:34.129> that

00:04:34.300 --> 00:04:34.310 
in the NHL squad so you won't get that

00:04:34.310 --> 00:04:36.459 
in the NHL squad so you won't get that
many<00:04:34.520> starts<00:04:34.969> you<00:04:35.629> need<00:04:35.779> to<00:04:35.870> take<00:04:35.990> advantage

00:04:36.459 --> 00:04:36.469 
many starts you need to take advantage

00:04:36.469 --> 00:04:38.110 
many starts you need to take advantage

00:04:38.120 --> 00:04:40.239 
of each start so you might want to
consider<00:04:38.419> using<00:04:38.689> the<00:04:38.930> reload<00:04:39.289> method<00:04:39.710> to
