00:00:08.300 --> 00:00:12.330
 Hey, people, beauty. 

00:00:10.590 --> 00:00:14.099
 good if you present a 

00:00:12.330 --> 00:00:16.590
 type of call that is widely used 

00:00:14.099 --> 00:00:18.960
 on the beach of fishing and also in part in 

00:00:16.590 --> 00:00:21.119
 rivers or dams with a 

00:00:18.960 --> 00:00:22.230
 determined current then this ceiling 

00:00:21.119 --> 00:00:24.779
 this call you are seeing 

00:00:22.230 --> 00:00:27.000
 video and also known as garatÃ©ias 

00:00:24.779 --> 00:00:27.599
 for presenting these students in the form of 

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:30.990
 cross 

00:00:27.599 --> 00:00:32.550
 around the body of the sink then okay 

00:00:30.990 --> 00:00:34.620
 this call is okay. 

00:00:32.550 --> 00:00:37.110
 simple here I have two models one 

00:00:34.620 --> 00:00:40.170
 different weight this orange model here 

00:00:37.110 --> 00:00:42.540
 weighs 100 grams and this one in red 

00:00:40.170 --> 00:00:44.180
 to 125 is an interesting thing when 

00:00:42.540 --> 00:00:46.440
 you are buying to get your call 

00:00:44.180 --> 00:00:48.000
 will present his balls and his 

00:00:46.440 --> 00:00:50.370
 mysteries here in different coloration 

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:52.680
 each heart has a specific weight 

00:00:50.370 --> 00:00:54.629
 right then you will stay on alert to 

00:00:52.680 --> 00:00:57.149
 that is also nothing to worry about 

00:00:54.629 --> 00:01:00.539
 much because in the body of the call here already 

00:00:57.149 --> 00:01:02.100
 has been saying how much each type of 

00:01:00.539 --> 00:01:04.290
 here is already written 

00:01:02.100 --> 00:01:06.659
 ali 100 grams r 125 

00:01:04.290 --> 00:01:10.020
 It's an interesting thing for you. 

00:01:06.659 --> 00:01:12.930
 stop making excitement about this here 

00:01:10.020 --> 00:01:14.820
 100 grams for example was interesting 

00:01:12.930 --> 00:01:17.460
 use local calls is presented 

00:01:14.820 --> 00:01:19.890
 a soil of sand or clay that is not 

00:01:17.460 --> 00:01:22.409
 interesting to use in places 

00:01:19.890 --> 00:01:24.570
 obviously the stone has a gravel 

00:01:22.409 --> 00:01:27.119
 something that will kill your whip in the 

00:01:24.570 --> 00:01:29.579
 background is this kind of call he bar 

00:01:27.119 --> 00:01:31.829
 very easy to present these wire 

00:01:29.579 --> 00:01:34.979
 around it but the working principle 

00:01:31.829 --> 00:01:37.229
 just when you rms the sport arrives 

00:01:34.979 --> 00:01:39.810
 in the background you give a pickup and staff 

00:01:37.229 --> 00:01:42.479
 for him will see that getting into the 

00:01:39.810 --> 00:01:44.520
 right sand is basically that there goes 

00:01:42.479 --> 00:01:47.310
 curb your whip will stay there 

00:01:44.520 --> 00:01:50.729
 fishing quietly waiting for a fish 

00:01:47.310 --> 00:01:52.200
 Anyway, and you'll get it right, it's usually 

00:01:50.729 --> 00:01:55.200
 the staff uses this type of call 

00:01:52.200 --> 00:01:56.490
 when you are fishing in places as 

00:01:55.200 --> 00:01:58.259
 said very quickly for the 

00:01:56.490 --> 00:02:00.869
 whip to your line do not walk too much 

00:01:58.259 --> 00:02:03.780
 not run and also you will stay in a 

00:02:00.869 --> 00:02:05.280
 place that has a current and you will 

00:02:03.780 --> 00:02:07.290
 fish with a 

00:02:05.280 --> 00:02:08.670
 friends or have someone on the side 

00:02:07.290 --> 00:02:10.830
 very close 

00:02:08.670 --> 00:02:12.900
 to not just wind up right you 

00:02:10.830 --> 00:02:15.120
 put this call on here she'll fall 

00:02:12.900 --> 00:02:17.280
 fall will get stretched there may 

00:02:15.120 --> 00:02:19.170
 fish in a peeled and will not 

00:02:17.280 --> 00:02:20.910
 roll one whip with the other for a 

00:02:19.170 --> 00:02:24.600
 panel fishing in a river that 

00:02:20.910 --> 00:02:26.160
 present much current right can 

00:02:24.600 --> 00:02:27.750
 see that this type of call also has 

00:02:26.160 --> 00:02:31.080
 a regulars galley if you want 

00:02:27.750 --> 00:02:34.260
 use only one ticket you can 

00:02:31.080 --> 00:02:36.780
 use will be free and the other 

00:02:34.260 --> 00:02:38.100
 here is stuck the friction with the 

00:02:36.780 --> 00:02:40.709
 ground is already going to be smaller 

00:02:38.100 --> 00:02:44.010
 okay then you have that option then you can 

00:02:40.709 --> 00:02:47.100
 leaving the two activated up is like 

00:02:44.010 --> 00:02:49.950
 you can leave only one or leave 

00:02:47.100 --> 00:02:51.930
 let go without any girl she 

00:02:49.950 --> 00:02:52.800
 You will then be free guys thereby 

00:02:51.930 --> 00:02:55.200
 Also here 

00:02:52.800 --> 00:02:57.390
 She will not work much on the ground. 

00:02:55.200 --> 00:02:59.730
 basically you will throw when 

00:02:57.390 --> 00:03:01.890
 pull it will not work and it will 

00:02:59.730 --> 00:03:05.430
 function almost like a normal call 

00:03:01.890 --> 00:03:07.980
 lists is more than I can tell 

00:03:05.430 --> 00:03:09.900
 you a car observation tip you 

00:03:07.980 --> 00:03:12.480
 to use only guys 

00:03:09.900 --> 00:03:16.860
 see if she is having too much friction 

00:03:12.480 --> 00:03:19.079
 between here and there is only this guide and 

00:03:16.860 --> 00:03:22.049
 The body of the sink is interesting for you. 

00:03:19.079 --> 00:03:25.019
 because sometimes there is a lot of 

00:03:22.049 --> 00:03:27.600
 closed to win here in between the 

00:03:25.019 --> 00:03:30.989
 two here and there she does not get discouraged when 

00:03:27.600 --> 00:03:33.360
 You pull ends up by forcing the windlass or 

00:03:30.989 --> 00:03:37.350
 reel and even the vacancy then 

00:03:33.360 --> 00:03:39.870
 always try is to observe in itself the 

00:03:37.350 --> 00:03:41.820
 unlocking is occurring easy not 

00:03:39.870 --> 00:03:45.150
 is working a lot that sometimes here 

00:03:41.820 --> 00:03:47.880
 come very closed and close here 

00:03:45.150 --> 00:03:49.260
 take the hang of it the way you do it when 

00:03:47.880 --> 00:03:52.380
 you collect can not unlock 

00:03:49.260 --> 00:03:54.959
 so give a little snack and in the open 

00:03:52.380 --> 00:03:59.910
 that the word open a little the Guarani 

00:03:54.959 --> 00:04:04.579
 certain way it will work easy 

00:03:59.910 --> 00:04:08.010
 when you collect the 

00:04:04.579 --> 00:04:10.440
 This place is plumb until it's pretty 

00:04:08.010 --> 00:04:11.880
 used as I have said in places with 

00:04:10.440 --> 00:04:14.790
 current and also the beach fishing 

00:04:11.880 --> 00:04:18.120
 has a calmer beach that is not 

00:04:14.790 --> 00:04:18.510
 must use these cats more here 

00:04:18.120 --> 00:04:20.910
 south 

00:04:18.510 --> 00:04:23.190
 which is constant presence wave always 

00:04:20.910 --> 00:04:25.620
 is running there in the other one then 

00:04:23.190 --> 00:04:27.750
 It's just that we use this a lot 

00:04:25.620 --> 00:04:29.370
 certain style called here the list 

00:04:27.750 --> 00:04:31.080
 It was a quick tip. 

00:04:29.370 --> 00:04:33.540
 people who are watching and already know 

00:04:31.080 --> 00:04:36.600
 this type of livestock up to this type of 

00:04:33.540 --> 00:04:37.890
 Actually, I guess so I hope 

00:04:36.600 --> 00:04:39.900
 I hope you have helped 

00:04:37.890 --> 00:04:41.400
 something if you like gives a force 

00:04:39.900 --> 00:04:43.200
 for the video click liked 

00:04:41.400 --> 00:04:45.810
 It's not weird on the channel you signed up for 

00:04:43.200 --> 00:04:47.910
 down a red button to receive the 

00:04:45.810 --> 00:04:49.980
 next videos of fishing tips 

00:04:47.910 --> 00:04:53.190
 information is also all related 

00:04:49.980 --> 00:04:55.440
 the piece and share this tip in the 

00:04:53.190 --> 00:04:57.330
 their friends there to stay 

00:04:55.440 --> 00:04:59.430
 inside this very interesting tip was worth 

00:04:57.330 --> 00:05:03.410
 So that's what we have next.
