 Hello everyone and welcome back to ipse dixit 

00:00:04.560 --> 00:00:09.059
 today's video at great demand 

00:00:06.240 --> 00:00:12.330
 we will see how to reproduce in fifa 15 the 

00:00:09.059 --> 00:00:14.280
 borussia dortmund of the mythical club first 

00:00:12.330 --> 00:00:15.900
 to start as usual with a child 

00:00:14.280 --> 00:00:17.609
 greetings space 

00:00:15.900 --> 00:00:20.369
 Today I thank you very much for your support 

00:00:17.609 --> 00:00:22.920
 that are giving me trembling fans that I am 

00:00:20.369 --> 00:00:25.980
 gianni cardellicchio enrico malpezzi e 

00:00:22.920 --> 00:00:27.539
 michele dimitri I remind you that if also 

00:00:25.980 --> 00:00:29.429
 you want to be greeted in mine 

00:00:27.539 --> 00:00:31.769
 next video you can leave a 

00:00:29.429 --> 00:00:33.600
 comment here on youtube or write to me 

00:00:31.769 --> 00:00:36.690
 on my facebook page you find 

00:00:33.600 --> 00:00:38.489
 linked in description 

00:00:36.690 --> 00:00:39.960
 I remind you that all the tactics exposed 

00:00:38.489 --> 00:00:42.420
 in this section they can be 

00:00:39.960 --> 00:00:44.160
 applied to various teams in this 

00:00:42.420 --> 00:00:45.170
 example I am of course using the 

00:00:44.160 --> 00:00:47.520
 borussia dortmund 

00:00:45.170 --> 00:00:49.590
 however this scheme is revealed 

00:00:47.520 --> 00:00:52.379
 particularly effective also with others 

00:00:49.590 --> 00:00:54.030
 team especially those with players 

00:00:52.379 --> 00:00:56.280
 rather fast 

00:00:54.030 --> 00:00:59.219
 maybe quite technically good at 

00:00:56.280 --> 00:01:00.059
 passages and with two wings fast and good 

00:00:59.219 --> 00:01:02.699
 in dribbling 

00:01:00.059 --> 00:01:04.439
 in particular the left wing should 

00:01:02.699 --> 00:01:06.470
 being able to play the role of 

00:01:04.439 --> 00:01:08.729
 striker 

00:01:06.470 --> 00:01:10.189
 I will not dwell on training 

00:01:08.729 --> 00:01:12.360
 always owns for the same reason 

00:01:10.189 --> 00:01:14.490
 because it is because this scheme can 

00:01:12.360 --> 00:01:15.869
 the rose must be applied for the teams 

00:01:14.490 --> 00:01:18.000
 a lot can be available 

00:01:15.869 --> 00:01:20.610
 variable but then I follow directly 

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:21.810
 to the module compared to the default one 

00:01:20.610 --> 00:01:24.390
 does not change much 

00:01:21.810 --> 00:01:26.549
 what I did I simply did 

00:01:24.390 --> 00:01:29.640
 advance two midfielders slightly 

00:01:26.549 --> 00:01:32.759
 defensive also the left one 

00:01:29.640 --> 00:01:34.710
 even slightly has hit the same 

00:01:32.759 --> 00:01:37.460
 way shifted a little to the right the 

00:01:34.710 --> 00:01:39.990
 central attacking midfielder coc 

00:01:37.460 --> 00:01:42.030
 while I moved from pretty 

00:01:39.990 --> 00:01:44.880
 left that as you see was made 

00:01:42.030 --> 00:01:45.329
 advancing is brought closer to the center of the 

00:01:44.880 --> 00:01:47.670
 field 

00:01:45.329 --> 00:01:49.890
 in this way we will often see between 

00:01:47.670 --> 00:01:52.820
 very little of the instructions go to 

00:01:49.890 --> 00:01:55.020
 also play as a second striker 

00:01:52.820 --> 00:01:57.260
 Now let us look at education as I have 

00:01:55.020 --> 00:01:59.760
 anticipated starting from the defense 

00:01:57.260 --> 00:02:01.860
 then sokratis in this case the 

00:01:59.760 --> 00:02:04.290
 central defender is always behind and 

00:02:01.860 --> 00:02:06.650
 the attack another central defender 

00:02:04.290 --> 00:02:09.539
 instead it participates in the offensive maneuver 

00:02:06.650 --> 00:02:11.760
 that indeed rather choral ie 

00:02:09.539 --> 00:02:12.650
 provides for the participation of the whole 

00:02:11.760 --> 00:02:15.030
 team 

00:02:12.650 --> 00:02:17.370
 the left back then the attack 

00:02:15.030 --> 00:02:20.280
 balanced while the right back 

00:02:17.370 --> 00:02:22.590
 since it is sokratis on its side and never 

00:02:20.280 --> 00:02:26.580
 in defense it can afford to overlap 

00:02:22.590 --> 00:02:29.550
 always then we have a dogan who 

00:02:26.580 --> 00:02:32.550
 intercepts lines of passage and advances 

00:02:29.550 --> 00:02:35.790
 then participates in the offensive maneuver 

00:02:32.550 --> 00:02:38.040
 sahin instead doesn't participate so much 

00:02:35.790 --> 00:02:39.950
 not offensive but a balanced attack 

00:02:38.040 --> 00:02:41.519
 this means that sometimes it helps 

00:02:39.950 --> 00:02:43.650
 the attack 

00:02:41.519 --> 00:02:46.350
 other times it remains in defense a 

00:02:43.650 --> 00:02:49.380
 defend this especially in the case in 

00:02:46.350 --> 00:02:53.730
 which a mels sardina boast and pure royce 

00:02:49.380 --> 00:02:56.069
 cut towards the center then the right or 

00:02:53.730 --> 00:02:59.489
 boom and young has a support in defense 

00:02:56.069 --> 00:03:00.540
 base remains wide and fits at 

00:02:59.489 --> 00:03:02.120
 shoulders 

00:03:00.540 --> 00:03:04.860
 finally an insertion for the crosses 

00:03:02.120 --> 00:03:07.200
 balanced in this way will never go 

00:03:04.860 --> 00:03:10.739
 or almost never to cut towards the center 

00:03:07.200 --> 00:03:13.709
 why we see it immediately because e 

00:03:10.739 --> 00:03:15.989
 reus instead to do so royce in fact remains 

00:03:13.709 --> 00:03:19.410
 ahead since it smelter more anyway 

00:03:15.989 --> 00:03:21.180
 as a defensive back to have inside 

00:03:19.410 --> 00:03:23.549
 becoming de facto often with inter is 

00:03:21.180 --> 00:03:25.950
 a second tip and then fits 

00:03:23.549 --> 00:03:29.459
 behind them also their inclusion for i 

00:03:25.950 --> 00:03:32.430
 balanced cross to make space royce 

00:03:29.459 --> 00:03:34.510
 what happens kagawa more often 

00:03:32.430 --> 00:03:35.920
 back on defense 

00:03:34.510 --> 00:03:38.140
 also in a teaching for the big ones 

00:03:35.920 --> 00:03:40.629
 balanced a free placement always 

00:03:38.140 --> 00:03:43.120
 because as I just said sometimes must 

00:03:40.629 --> 00:03:44.319
 return to the defense to lend a hand 

00:03:43.120 --> 00:03:45.939
 so much so that as you see the two 

00:03:44.319 --> 00:03:47.560
 defensive midfielders are enough 

00:03:45.939 --> 00:03:49.659
 wide than usual 

00:03:47.560 --> 00:03:51.849
 precisely to allow riding 

00:03:49.659 --> 00:03:53.409
 get in the way 

00:03:51.849 --> 00:03:55.930
 there will remain a free space in which 

00:03:53.409 --> 00:03:58.209
 royce can fit and then needle bayan 

00:03:55.930 --> 00:04:00.010
 must remain on the right 

00:03:58.209 --> 00:04:02.950
 finally he remains the attacker in this 

00:04:00.010 --> 00:04:05.590
 case this example ramos that presses 

00:04:02.950 --> 00:04:07.659
 defenders and has a balanced width 

00:04:05.590 --> 00:04:10.450
 this means that sometimes it expands 

00:04:07.659 --> 00:04:13.150
 to make space for inserting reus 

00:04:10.450 --> 00:04:16.630
 other times it remains at the center and at 

00:04:13.150 --> 00:04:18.489
 an offensive insertion by inserting yes 

00:04:16.630 --> 00:04:20.829
 behind to receive a ball 

00:04:18.489 --> 00:04:22.539
 with a filtering passage others with 

00:04:20.829 --> 00:04:24.340
 other times it stops and goes up 

00:04:22.539 --> 00:04:28.270
 the team or plays back to the 

00:04:24.340 --> 00:04:30.840
 door and then serve on the run 2 milan 

00:04:28.270 --> 00:04:33.130
 or royce or even possibly 

00:04:30.840 --> 00:04:35.350
 the insertion of the same kagawa that 

00:04:33.130 --> 00:04:37.150
 however, he does not always return to the defense but 

00:04:35.350 --> 00:04:39.660
 other times it remains in attack a 

00:04:37.150 --> 00:04:41.460
 support the maneuver 

00:04:39.660 --> 00:04:44.830
 let's look at tactics now 

00:04:41.460 --> 00:04:47.530
 customized as you all know then 

00:04:44.830 --> 00:04:51.849
 probably the speed is rather 

00:04:47.530 --> 00:04:55.210
 high indeed the passage is set to 85 

00:04:51.849 --> 00:04:57.370
 instead they are mistri I put 45 bruce ed 

00:04:55.210 --> 00:04:58.720
 in fact the garden does not make a kind of tiki 

00:04:57.370 --> 00:05:01.180
 taka barcelona 

00:04:58.720 --> 00:05:03.970
 however the possession is very much 

00:05:01.180 --> 00:05:06.190
 less stars in fact between a passage and 

00:05:03.970 --> 00:05:08.320
 the other is not rare at all 

00:05:06.190 --> 00:05:10.570
 a sudden verticalization that 

00:05:08.320 --> 00:05:13.690
 I'm going to do insert one of the rituals or 

00:05:10.570 --> 00:05:15.610
 also directly the attacker then a 

00:05:13.690 --> 00:05:17.860
 sometimes they are short passages and midfield 

00:05:15.610 --> 00:05:21.880
 other times long passages towards 

00:05:17.860 --> 00:05:23.800
 the attack or towards the 22 external 

00:05:21.880 --> 00:05:24.720
 your trocar's position for 

00:05:23.800 --> 00:05:26.889
 to organize 

00:05:24.720 --> 00:05:28.840
 on creation occasion we have passages 

00:05:26.889 --> 00:05:29.710
 very risky set the parameter 

00:05:28.840 --> 00:05:32.740
 to 92 

00:05:29.710 --> 00:05:34.900
 This is because as I said before the 

00:05:32.740 --> 00:05:38.110
 conversely verticalizations a bit of the 

00:05:34.900 --> 00:05:40.600
 guardian tiki taka and I am much more 

00:05:38.110 --> 00:05:42.699
 frequent and therefore with a parameter 

00:05:40.600 --> 00:05:44.410
 set such a high value is more 

00:05:42.699 --> 00:05:46.600
 easy for our players to 

00:05:44.410 --> 00:05:47.740
 insert be ready to receive a 

00:05:46.600 --> 00:05:51.220
 filtering passage one 

00:05:47.740 --> 00:05:53.949
 verticalization precisely the cross e 

00:05:51.220 --> 00:05:55.870
 shooting is on average frequent 

00:05:53.949 --> 00:05:57.789
 so there is no choice to be preferred 

00:05:55.870 --> 00:06:00.910
 a second of the situation can be 

00:05:57.789 --> 00:06:02.530
 go on the wing to cross or 

00:06:00.910 --> 00:06:04.060
 maybe even try to conclude from 

00:06:02.530 --> 00:06:07.410
 out of area 

00:06:04.060 --> 00:06:09.550
 in attack instead the position is free 

00:06:07.410 --> 00:06:11.500
 defense has a pressing and 

00:06:09.550 --> 00:06:14.560
 a rather balanced aggression 

00:06:11.500 --> 00:06:16.870
 set to 60 then a team that 

00:06:14.560 --> 00:06:19.479
 it's not too far forward but not staying 

00:06:16.870 --> 00:06:22.560
 also too far behind and doubling 

00:06:19.479 --> 00:06:25.000
 when needed but never over the top 

00:06:22.560 --> 00:06:28.060
 the team width also attributed to 

00:06:25.000 --> 00:06:30.180
 60 since burns dead jellyfish 

00:06:28.060 --> 00:06:32.620
 quite often the game change 

00:06:30.180 --> 00:06:34.750
 however, increase the width too much 

00:06:32.620 --> 00:06:37.240
 team especially in defense 

00:06:34.750 --> 00:06:39.400
 he would use some problems when he got there 

00:06:37.240 --> 00:06:43.180
 I therefore go to defend myself 

00:06:39.400 --> 00:06:44.620
 I recommend setting it to 60 only 

00:06:43.180 --> 00:06:46.510
 the defensive line naturally 

00:06:44.620 --> 00:06:48.529
 coverage since the pressing is not 

00:06:46.510 --> 00:06:50.779
 very high 

00:06:48.529 --> 00:06:52.669
 that's why this video is everything 

00:06:50.779 --> 00:06:53.529
 guys I thank you as always for 

00:06:52.669 --> 00:06:56.449
 attention 

00:06:53.529 --> 00:06:58.309
 if you liked this tactic and the 

00:06:56.449 --> 00:07:00.379
 form for useful result you are me 

00:06:58.309 --> 00:07:02.449
 found well I recommend you leave a 

00:07:00.379 --> 00:07:05.479
 I like it and write to the channel for non 

00:07:02.449 --> 00:07:09.279
 miss my next videos I will 

00:07:05.479 --> 00:07:09.279
 Greetings to the next video Hello everyone
