sinners and guitar players do when they
change<00:00:30.670> the<00:00:31.090> pitch<00:00:31.360> of<00:00:31.390> the<00:00:31.810> note<00:00:31.990> so<00:00:32.650> it's<00:00:32.770> not

00:00:32.820 --> 00:00:32.830

00:00:34.590 --> 00:00:34.600 
the amplitude going up and down it's the

00:00:34.600 --> 00:00:38.760 
the amplitude going up and down it's the
pace<00:00:34.809> doing<00:00:35.110> the<00:00:36.960> only<00:00:37.960> I<00:00:38.050> can<00:00:38.170> get<00:00:38.290> a<00:00:38.320> pantsuit

00:01:00.380 --> 00:01:00.390 

00:01:00.390 --> 00:01:01.970 

just<00:01:01.140> to<00:01:01.230> give<00:01:01.350> you<00:01:01.440> that<00:01:01.530> you<00:01:01.649> have<00:01:01.770> some

00:01:16.550 --> 00:01:16.560 
so just ask this very nice shimmery kind

00:01:16.560 --> 00:01:18.950 
so just ask this very nice shimmery kind
of<00:01:16.650> effect<00:01:16.950> to<00:01:17.100> yourself<00:01:17.490> and<00:01:17.730> that's<00:01:18.570> great

00:01:18.950 --> 00:01:18.960 
of effect to yourself and that's great

00:01:18.960 --> 00:01:20.870 
of effect to yourself and that's great
for<00:01:19.230> types<00:01:20.010> of<00:01:20.130> things<00:01:20.310> that<00:01:20.370> I<00:01:20.490> just<00:01:20.700> played

00:01:20.870 --> 00:01:20.880 
for types of things that I just played

00:01:20.880 --> 00:01:23.030 
for types of things that I just played
now<00:01:21.090> you<00:01:21.690> can<00:01:21.840> also<00:01:21.990> use<00:01:22.080> it<00:01:22.260> faster<00:01:22.800> to<00:01:22.830> get

00:01:23.030 --> 00:01:23.040 
now you can also use it faster to get

00:01:23.040 --> 00:01:25.460 
now you can also use it faster to get
almost<00:01:23.400> basically<00:01:23.850> type<00:01:24.030> sounds<00:01:24.450> so<00:01:24.660> let's

00:01:25.460 --> 00:01:25.470 
almost basically type sounds so let's

00:01:25.470 --> 00:01:48.620 
almost basically type sounds so let's
move<00:01:25.620> up<00:01:25.830> to<00:01:25.950> speed<00:01:26.190> of<00:01:26.310> it<00:01:27.920> yeah<00:01:28.920> that<00:01:29.130> sounds

00:01:48.620 --> 00:01:48.630 

00:01:48.630 --> 00:01:51.480 

another<00:01:49.630> great<00:01:49.869> use<00:01:50.350> of<00:01:50.409> a<00:01:50.710> if<00:01:50.979> I'm<00:01:51.130> I<00:01:51.250> borrow

00:01:51.480 --> 00:01:51.490 
another great use of a if I'm I borrow

00:01:51.490 --> 00:01:53.160 
another great use of a if I'm I borrow
pedal<00:01:51.790> is<00:01:51.939> to<00:01:52.210> use<00:01:52.360> it<00:01:52.390> a<00:01:52.600> little<00:01:52.750> bit<00:01:52.899> slower

00:01:53.160 --> 00:01:53.170 
pedal is to use it a little bit slower

00:01:53.170 --> 00:01:55.350 
pedal is to use it a little bit slower
just<00:01:53.920> to<00:01:54.009> give<00:01:54.189> it<00:01:54.310> a<00:01:54.369> bit<00:01:54.520> of<00:01:54.549> quirkiness<00:01:55.090> to

00:01:55.350 --> 00:01:55.360 
just to give it a bit of quirkiness to

00:01:55.360 --> 00:01:56.730 
just to give it a bit of quirkiness to
your<00:01:55.479> playing<00:01:55.689> so<00:01:55.960> it<00:01:56.049> basically<00:01:56.200> adds<00:01:56.619> a

00:01:56.730 --> 00:01:56.740 
your playing so it basically adds a

00:01:56.740 --> 00:01:58.530 
your playing so it basically adds a
little<00:01:56.860> bit<00:01:57.009> of<00:01:57.130> witness<00:01:57.820> to<00:01:58.000> your<00:01:58.030> to<00:01:58.509> your

00:01:58.530 --> 00:01:58.540 
little bit of witness to your to your

00:01:58.540 --> 00:02:00.029 
little bit of witness to your to your
riff<00:01:58.869> or<00:01:59.049> whatever<00:01:59.290> you're<00:01:59.470> planning<00:01:59.560> to<00:01:59.890> this

so shade of our products and amazing
easy<00:02:19.030> pedal<00:02:19.360> to<00:02:19.450> use<00:02:19.629> you<00:02:19.930> basically<00:02:20.110> have

00:02:20.430 --> 00:02:20.440 
easy pedal to use you basically have

00:02:20.440 --> 00:02:22.289 
easy pedal to use you basically have
phone<00:02:20.769> apps<00:02:20.980> that<00:02:21.280> lets<00:02:21.489> you<00:02:21.580> select<00:02:21.819> a<00:02:22.120> number

00:02:22.289 --> 00:02:22.299 
phone apps that lets you select a number

00:02:22.299 --> 00:02:23.820 
phone apps that lets you select a number
of<00:02:22.510> different<00:02:22.629> sounds<00:02:23.140> so<00:02:23.620> you<00:02:23.709> have<00:02:23.799> a

00:02:23.820 --> 00:02:23.830 
of different sounds so you have a

00:02:23.830 --> 00:02:25.830 
of different sounds so you have a
speeding<00:02:24.220> up<00:02:24.310> that<00:02:24.610> selects<00:02:25.000> how<00:02:25.180> fast<00:02:25.510> the

00:02:25.830 --> 00:02:25.840 
speeding up that selects how fast the

00:02:25.840 --> 00:02:28.110 
speeding up that selects how fast the
the<00:02:26.379> vibrato<00:02:26.650> is<00:02:26.860> moving<00:02:27.220> you<00:02:27.760> have<00:02:27.879> a<00:02:27.909> deaf

00:02:28.110 --> 00:02:28.120 
the vibrato is moving you have a deaf

00:02:28.120 --> 00:02:30.180 
the vibrato is moving you have a deaf
nerve<00:02:28.390> that<00:02:28.690> controls<00:02:28.750> how<00:02:29.290> wide<00:02:29.680> the<00:02:29.890> vibrato

00:02:30.180 --> 00:02:30.190 
nerve that controls how wide the vibrato

00:02:30.190 --> 00:02:32.190 
nerve that controls how wide the vibrato
should<00:02:30.519> be<00:02:30.700> then<00:02:31.659> we<00:02:31.780> have<00:02:31.900> something<00:02:32.170> called

00:02:32.190 --> 00:02:32.200 
should be then we have something called

00:02:32.200 --> 00:02:33.960 
should be then we have something called
a<00:02:32.409> rise<00:02:32.620> time<00:02:32.890> and<00:02:33.129> that<00:02:33.340> needs<00:02:33.579> a<00:02:33.670> little<00:02:33.819> bit

00:02:33.960 --> 00:02:33.970 
a rise time and that needs a little bit

00:02:33.970 --> 00:02:36.660 
a rise time and that needs a little bit
of<00:02:34.000> explain<00:02:34.329> ok<00:02:35.260> so<00:02:35.739> the<00:02:35.890> rise<00:02:36.069> time<00:02:36.280> control

00:02:36.660 --> 00:02:36.670 
of explain ok so the rise time control

00:02:36.670 --> 00:02:38.550 
of explain ok so the rise time control
allows<00:02:36.970> you<00:02:37.150> to<00:02:37.329> dial<00:02:37.690> in<00:02:37.900> how<00:02:38.079> much<00:02:38.260> time

00:02:38.550 --> 00:02:38.560 
allows you to dial in how much time

00:02:38.560 --> 00:02:40.500 
allows you to dial in how much time
should<00:02:38.709> take<00:02:38.950> before<00:02:39.129> the<00:02:39.549> vibrato<00:02:40.060> actually

00:02:40.500 --> 00:02:40.510 
should take before the vibrato actually

00:02:40.510 --> 00:02:43.259 
should take before the vibrato actually
reaches<00:02:40.870> its<00:02:41.049> maximum<00:02:41.230> vibrato<00:02:41.980> or<00:02:42.340> sound<00:02:42.610> so

00:02:43.259 --> 00:02:43.269 
reaches its maximum vibrato or sound so

00:02:43.269 --> 00:02:45.030 
reaches its maximum vibrato or sound so
let's<00:02:43.450> check<00:02:43.690> this<00:02:43.840> out<00:02:44.049> and<00:02:44.680> so<00:02:44.860> right<00:02:45.010> now

00:02:45.030 --> 00:02:45.040 
let's check this out and so right now

00:02:45.040 --> 00:02:48.600 
let's check this out and so right now
the<00:02:45.250> pedal<00:02:45.549> this<00:02:45.640> off

00:02:48.600 --> 00:02:48.610 

00:02:48.610 --> 00:02:51.120 

and<00:02:49.330> when<00:02:49.450> I<00:02:49.540> turn<00:02:49.720> on<00:02:49.840> the<00:02:49.900> vibrato<00:02:50.290> petal

00:02:51.120 --> 00:02:51.130 
and when I turn on the vibrato petal

00:02:51.130 --> 00:02:52.440 
and when I turn on the vibrato petal
you'll<00:02:51.370> notice<00:02:51.580> that<00:02:51.700> it<00:02:51.910> actually<00:02:52.030> takes<00:02:52.390> a

00:02:52.440 --> 00:02:52.450 
you'll notice that it actually takes a

00:02:52.450 --> 00:02:53.790 
you'll notice that it actually takes a
little<00:02:52.570> time<00:02:52.810> before<00:02:52.990> it<00:02:53.230> gets<00:02:53.410> up<00:02:53.560> to<00:02:53.680> the

00:02:53.790 --> 00:02:53.800 
little time before it gets up to the

00:02:53.800 --> 00:02:55.590 
little time before it gets up to the
maximum<00:02:54.100> amount<00:02:54.340> of<00:02:54.550> my<00:02:54.670> family<00:02:55.060> so<00:02:55.450> it's

00:02:55.590 --> 00:02:55.600 
maximum amount of my family so it's

00:02:55.600 --> 00:03:05.000 
maximum amount of my family so it's
slowly<00:02:55.870> builds<00:02:56.260> over<00:02:56.470> time

00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:05.010 

00:03:05.010 --> 00:03:07.410 

sunnybank<00:03:06.010> I'm<00:03:06.190> turn<00:03:06.550> it<00:03:06.640> on<00:03:06.790> again<00:03:07.000> I'll<00:03:07.180> get

00:03:07.410 --> 00:03:07.420 
sunnybank I'm turn it on again I'll get

00:03:07.420 --> 00:03:15.970 
sunnybank I'm turn it on again I'll get
the<00:03:07.540> same<00:03:07.720> with<00:03:07.840> it

00:03:15.970 --> 00:03:15.980 

00:03:15.980 --> 00:03:19.220 

so<00:03:16.980> this<00:03:17.129> is<00:03:17.159> grateful<00:03:17.730> for<00:03:18.659> using<00:03:18.900> the<00:03:18.959> pivot

00:03:19.220 --> 00:03:19.230 
so this is grateful for using the pivot

00:03:19.230 --> 00:03:22.220 
so this is grateful for using the pivot
to<00:03:19.319> do<00:03:19.470> like<00:03:19.769> slow<00:03:20.670> swells<00:03:21.150> that<00:03:21.480> slowly

00:03:22.220 --> 00:03:22.230 
to do like slow swells that slowly

00:03:22.230 --> 00:03:24.050 
to do like slow swells that slowly
accidentally<00:03:23.010> the<00:03:23.069> vibrato<00:03:23.489> a<00:03:23.640> lot<00:03:23.879> of<00:03:23.970> our

00:03:24.050 --> 00:03:24.060 
accidentally the vibrato a lot of our

00:03:24.060 --> 00:03:26.479 
accidentally the vibrato a lot of our
problems<00:03:24.150> of<00:03:24.480> your<00:03:24.510> sound<00:03:24.920> the<00:03:25.920> last<00:03:26.129> control

00:03:26.479 --> 00:03:26.489 
problems of your sound the last control

00:03:26.489 --> 00:03:28.580 
problems of your sound the last control
is<00:03:26.610> the<00:03:26.640> tone<00:03:26.909> control<00:03:27.269> so<00:03:28.049> the<00:03:28.230> total<00:03:28.409> control

00:03:28.580 --> 00:03:28.590 
is the tone control so the total control

00:03:28.590 --> 00:03:30.259 
is the tone control so the total control
allows<00:03:28.980> your<00:03:29.189> dog<00:03:29.340> back<00:03:29.549> to<00:03:29.730> hide<00:03:29.879> a<00:03:29.909> little

00:03:30.259 --> 00:03:30.269 
allows your dog back to hide a little

00:03:30.269 --> 00:03:32.180 
allows your dog back to hide a little
bit<00:03:30.390> if<00:03:30.480> you<00:03:30.569> want<00:03:30.750> more<00:03:30.900> mellow<00:03:31.140> sounds<00:03:31.560> so

00:03:32.180 --> 00:03:32.190 
bit if you want more mellow sounds so

00:03:32.190 --> 00:03:39.490 
bit if you want more mellow sounds so
here<00:03:32.370> is<00:03:32.489> it<00:03:32.640> cracked<00:03:37.579> we<00:03:38.579> can<00:03:38.730> down<00:03:38.879> it<00:03:39.030> back

00:03:39.490 --> 00:03:39.500 
here is it cracked we can down it back

00:03:39.500 --> 00:03:59.809 
here is it cracked we can down it back
to<00:03:40.500> get<00:03:40.680> a<00:03:40.709> darker<00:03:40.950> sound<00:03:58.340> the<00:03:59.340> tongue<00:03:59.549> switch

00:03:59.809 --> 00:03:59.819 
to get a darker sound the tongue switch

00:03:59.819 --> 00:04:01.190 
to get a darker sound the tongue switch
up<00:03:59.970> here<00:04:00.150> that<00:04:00.329> selects<00:04:00.690> between<00:04:00.780> three

00:04:01.190 --> 00:04:01.200 
up here that selects between three

00:04:01.200 --> 00:04:02.509 
up here that selects between three
different<00:04:01.349> notes<00:04:01.739> what<00:04:02.040> you've<00:04:02.190> heard<00:04:02.310> so<00:04:02.370> far

00:04:02.509 --> 00:04:02.519 
different notes what you've heard so far

00:04:02.519 --> 00:04:05.330 
different notes what you've heard so far
is<00:04:02.940> the<00:04:03.359> record<00:04:03.870> of<00:04:04.049> my<00:04:04.139> browser<00:04:04.379> mode<00:04:04.650> at<00:04:05.159> the

00:04:05.330 --> 00:04:05.340 
is the record of my browser mode at the

00:04:05.340 --> 00:04:06.500 
is the record of my browser mode at the
bottom<00:04:05.609> down<00:04:05.730> here<00:04:05.790> we<00:04:06.090> have<00:04:06.209> something

00:04:06.500 --> 00:04:06.510 
bottom down here we have something

00:04:06.510 --> 00:04:08.210 
bottom down here we have something
called<00:04:06.540> less<00:04:06.840> more<00:04:07.079> and<00:04:07.290> that's<00:04:07.530> really<00:04:08.040> great

00:04:08.210 --> 00:04:08.220 
called less more and that's really great

00:04:08.220 --> 00:04:11.420 
called less more and that's really great
so<00:04:09.060> let's<00:04:09.420> move<00:04:09.569> basically<00:04:10.129> changes<00:04:11.129> the<00:04:11.280> way

00:04:11.420 --> 00:04:11.430 
so let's move basically changes the way

00:04:11.430 --> 00:04:13.849 
so let's move basically changes the way
the<00:04:11.459> foot<00:04:11.790> switch<00:04:11.879> works<00:04:12.209> so<00:04:12.930> right<00:04:13.139> now<00:04:13.170> when

00:04:13.849 --> 00:04:13.859 
the foot switch works so right now when

00:04:13.859 --> 00:04:15.890 
the foot switch works so right now when
I<00:04:13.889> press<00:04:14.099> the<00:04:14.310> foot<00:04:14.459> switch<00:04:14.609> instead<00:04:15.569> of<00:04:15.690> team

00:04:15.890 --> 00:04:15.900 
I press the foot switch instead of team

00:04:15.900 --> 00:04:18.080 
I press the foot switch instead of team
on<00:04:16.139> and<00:04:16.289> off<00:04:16.380> it's<00:04:16.919> only<00:04:17.280> on<00:04:17.430> as<00:04:17.669> long<00:04:17.849> as<00:04:17.970> I

00:04:18.080 --> 00:04:18.090 
on and off it's only on as long as I

00:04:18.090 --> 00:04:19.670 
on and off it's only on as long as I
hold<00:04:18.269> the<00:04:18.479> foot<00:04:18.630> switch<00:04:18.750> down<00:04:19.049> so<00:04:19.380> this<00:04:19.530> allows

00:04:19.670 --> 00:04:19.680 
hold the foot switch down so this allows

00:04:19.680 --> 00:04:23.659 
hold the foot switch down so this allows
me<00:04:19.799> to<00:04:20.099> do<00:04:20.250> something<00:04:20.609> like<00:04:21.000> this<00:04:21.810> so<00:04:22.680> let's

00:04:23.659 --> 00:04:23.669 
me to do something like this so let's

00:04:23.669 --> 00:04:25.909 
me to do something like this so let's
say<00:04:23.789> I'm<00:04:24.030> on<00:04:24.180> elite<00:04:24.470> doing<00:04:25.470> a<00:04:25.560> leader<00:04:25.740> and<00:04:25.860> I

00:04:25.909 --> 00:04:25.919 
say I'm on elite doing a leader and I

00:04:25.919 --> 00:04:27.830 
say I'm on elite doing a leader and I
want<00:04:26.130> something<00:04:26.370> extreme<00:04:26.910> for<00:04:27.120> just<00:04:27.300> one<00:04:27.479> no<00:04:27.660> I

00:04:27.830 --> 00:04:27.840 
want something extreme for just one no I

00:04:27.840 --> 00:04:46.280 
want something extreme for just one no I
can<00:04:28.020> do<00:04:28.110> something<00:04:28.349> like

00:04:46.280 --> 00:04:46.290 

00:04:46.290 --> 00:04:48.690 

so<00:04:47.290> I<00:04:47.320> can<00:04:47.500> basically<00:04:47.680> have<00:04:47.890> my<00:04:48.400> brother

00:04:48.690 --> 00:04:48.700 
so I can basically have my brother

00:04:48.700 --> 00:04:50.400 
so I can basically have my brother
whenever<00:04:49.090> a<00:04:49.180> few<00:04:49.420> like<00:04:49.570> so<00:04:49.930> it<00:04:49.990> can<00:04:50.110> be<00:04:50.230> used

00:04:50.400 --> 00:04:50.410 
whenever a few like so it can be used

00:04:50.410 --> 00:04:53.250 
whenever a few like so it can be used
for<00:04:50.500> extreme<00:04:50.860> stuff<00:04:51.130> like<00:04:51.630> like<00:04:52.630> solos<00:04:53.050> like<00:04:53.230> I

00:04:53.250 --> 00:04:53.260 
for extreme stuff like like solos like I

00:04:53.260 --> 00:04:56.000 
for extreme stuff like like solos like I
just<00:04:53.470> did<00:04:53.590> but<00:04:53.830> you<00:04:53.920> can<00:04:54.040> also<00:04:54.160> use<00:04:54.250> it<00:04:54.610> to

00:04:56.000 --> 00:04:56.010 
just did but you can also use it to

00:04:56.010 --> 00:05:00.270 
just did but you can also use it to
simulate<00:04:57.010> the<00:04:57.400> use<00:04:57.610> of<00:04:57.640> the<00:04:58.090> web<00:04:58.300> app<00:04:58.600> and<00:04:59.280> of

00:05:00.270 --> 00:05:00.280 
simulate the use of the web app and of

00:05:00.280 --> 00:05:01.920 
simulate the use of the web app and of
course<00:05:00.490> playing<00:05:01.030> on<00:05:01.120> the<00:05:01.150> store<00:05:01.420> like<00:05:01.600> this<00:05:01.630> I

00:05:01.920 --> 00:05:01.930 
course playing on the store like this I

00:05:01.930 --> 00:05:03.540 
course playing on the store like this I
don't<00:05:01.960> have<00:05:02.260> one<00:05:02.500> right<00:05:02.560> now<00:05:02.770> but<00:05:03.310> I<00:05:03.340> can

00:05:03.540 --> 00:05:03.550 
don't have one right now but I can

00:05:03.550 --> 00:05:06.480 
don't have one right now but I can
actually<00:05:03.850> take<00:05:04.360> one<00:05:04.570> so<00:05:04.750> to<00:05:04.810> speak<00:05:05.310> so<00:05:06.310> let's

00:05:06.480 --> 00:05:06.490 
actually take one so to speak so let's

00:05:06.490 --> 00:05:27.210 
actually take one so to speak so let's
try<00:05:06.670> this<00:05:06.730> out

00:05:27.210 --> 00:05:27.220 

00:05:27.220 --> 00:05:29.770 

so<00:05:28.220> that's<00:05:28.400> the<00:05:28.550> last<00:05:28.699> mode<00:05:28.940> and<00:05:29.120> last<00:05:29.509> but<00:05:29.599> not

00:05:29.770 --> 00:05:29.780 
so that's the last mode and last but not

00:05:29.780 --> 00:05:32.290 
so that's the last mode and last but not
least<00:05:29.840> we<00:05:30.530> have<00:05:30.560> to<00:05:31.039> print<00:05:31.310> and<00:05:31.580> temperate<00:05:32.150> is

00:05:32.290 --> 00:05:32.300 
least we have to print and temperate is

00:05:32.300 --> 00:05:34.059 
least we have to print and temperate is
something<00:05:32.599> entirely<00:05:32.930> new<00:05:33.139> it<00:05:33.860> basically

00:05:34.059 --> 00:05:34.069 
something entirely new it basically

00:05:34.069 --> 00:05:36.219 
something entirely new it basically
allows<00:05:34.550> you<00:05:34.940> to<00:05:35.060> change<00:05:35.330> the<00:05:35.479> way<00:05:35.720> the<00:05:35.900> petal

00:05:36.219 --> 00:05:36.229 
allows you to change the way the petal

00:05:36.229 --> 00:05:39.339 
allows you to change the way the petal
sounds<00:05:37.180> inside<00:05:38.180> the<00:05:38.360> pedal<00:05:38.660> on<00:05:38.840> some<00:05:39.050> of<00:05:39.169> the

00:05:39.339 --> 00:05:39.349 
sounds inside the pedal on some of the

00:05:39.349 --> 00:05:40.870 
sounds inside the pedal on some of the
controls<00:05:39.770> to<00:05:39.860> simple<00:05:40.190> controls<00:05:40.490> we<00:05:40.580> have<00:05:40.699> here

00:05:40.870 --> 00:05:40.880 
controls to simple controls we have here

00:05:40.880 --> 00:05:42.430 
controls to simple controls we have here
that's<00:05:41.360> literally<00:05:41.690> hundreds<00:05:42.169> of<00:05:42.259> different

00:05:42.430 --> 00:05:42.440 
that's literally hundreds of different

00:05:42.440 --> 00:05:44.469
