 heimsbrunn passion bike club and who 

00:00:50.890 --> 00:00:54.790
 will tell us a little bit about this 

00:00:52.570 --> 00:00:56.440
 event we are already the 6th 

00:00:54.790 --> 00:00:57.399
 night edition of the big calves the 

00:00:56.440 --> 00:01:00.010
 night big calves it's a 

00:00:57.399 --> 00:01:02.049
 timed sports hike from 

00:01:00.010 --> 00:01:03.940
 four hours with a departure at 20h and 

00:01:02.049 --> 00:01:04.780
 an arrival at midnight and the principle 

00:01:03.940 --> 00:01:07.210
 it's to do the most laps 

00:01:04.780 --> 00:01:10.690
 possible on an entirely 

00:01:07.210 --> 00:01:11.619
 marked out of 6 km 5 so given the conditions 

00:01:10.690 --> 00:01:13.149
 weather 

00:01:11.619 --> 00:01:14.979
 could you have had a lot 

00:01:13.149 --> 00:01:15.550
 of participants in relation to the years 

00:01:14.979 --> 00:01:17.890
 previous 

00:01:15.550 --> 00:01:19.600
 the participation is exceptional account 

00:01:17.890 --> 00:01:20.679
 given the weather conditions that are 

00:01:19.600 --> 00:01:22.539
 frankly unfavorable 

00:01:20.679 --> 00:01:24.940
 we broke the meadow record 

00:01:22.539 --> 00:01:26.050
 registration with almost 120 122 pre 

00:01:24.940 --> 00:01:26.800
 enrolled this year what is this 

00:01:26.050 --> 00:01:29.560
 never happened 

00:01:26.800 --> 00:01:30.880
 and that's despite the weather conditions 

00:01:29.560 --> 00:01:32.110
 actually we really have a 

00:01:30.880 --> 00:01:34.390
 manifestation that was a big and 

00:01:32.110 --> 00:01:36.369
 success and we are very happy 

00:01:34.390 --> 00:01:38.799
 sir sir manu to be to be 

00:01:36.369 --> 00:01:41.950
 come to be invited by you for for 

00:01:38.799 --> 00:01:43.539
 tell these and noah on TV then 

00:01:41.950 --> 00:01:45.700
 it is an exceptional event since 

00:01:43.539 --> 00:01:46.509
 there are no other races of those 

00:01:45.700 --> 00:01:48.369
 of this ilk 

00:01:46.509 --> 00:01:50.830
 actually it's a race 

00:01:48.369 --> 00:01:52.660
 completely original the concept is 

00:01:50.830 --> 00:01:54.069
 completely innovative since 

00:01:52.660 --> 00:01:55.780
 actually these semi nocturnal 

00:01:54.069 --> 00:01:57.569
 we start at 20h we finish at midnight we 

00:01:55.780 --> 00:02:00.489
 start playing we finish at night 

00:01:57.569 --> 00:02:01.840
 it is a relay of mountain bikers the choice 

00:02:00.489 --> 00:02:02.530
 relays is completely free level 

00:02:01.840 --> 00:02:03.789
 some participants 

00:02:02.530 --> 00:02:05.440
 so here is a lot of 

00:02:03.789 --> 00:02:07.119
 conviviality is a test that pleases 

00:02:05.440 --> 00:02:08.590
 a lot and every year ben there is a 

00:02:07.119 --> 00:02:10.869
 little more success each year more than 

00:02:08.590 --> 00:02:12.459
 participants and you see it as low 

00:02:10.869 --> 00:02:14.019
 I would say the village is behind us 

00:02:12.459 --> 00:02:15.700
 every year the departure village takes 

00:02:14.019 --> 00:02:17.860
 more scale and more and more 

00:02:15.700 --> 00:02:19.780
 actually imposing and shows that it 

00:02:17.860 --> 00:02:20.370
 a demonstration really happened to 

00:02:19.780 --> 00:02:22.390
 maturity 

00:02:20.370 --> 00:02:24.370
 so just now we have seen some 

00:02:22.390 --> 00:02:25.840
 children participated in the big night 

00:02:24.370 --> 00:02:27.730
 calves you can tell some 

00:02:25.840 --> 00:02:29.709
 words yes so so before the test 

00:02:27.730 --> 00:02:31.660
 queen who is the night of the big calves to 

00:02:29.709 --> 00:02:33.489
 20 hours ago at 17h a test that 

00:02:31.660 --> 00:02:35.019
 is meant for the youngest ones the mini 

00:02:33.489 --> 00:02:36.890
 night big calves and the principle 

00:02:35.019 --> 00:02:39.200
 it's minimal categories 

00:02:36.890 --> 00:02:41.150
 benjamins pupils that rushes for a 

00:02:39.200 --> 00:02:43.790
 course I would say night big calves 

00:02:41.150 --> 00:02:44.930
 lightened and who have until provocation 

00:02:43.790 --> 00:02:47.120
 to actually bite one another's teeth 

00:02:44.930 --> 00:02:49.160
 on courses that are a little less 

00:02:47.120 --> 00:02:51.140
 selective but nevertheless 

00:02:49.160 --> 00:02:53.709
 interesting for young mountain bikers 

00:02:51.140 --> 00:02:53.709
 budding 

00:02:59.250 --> 00:03:05.260
 so here is an example of the results that 

00:03:02.980 --> 00:03:07.720
 one can get when one has done a 

00:03:05.260 --> 00:03:09.250
 adult course tour so I'll tell you 

00:03:07.720 --> 00:03:11.320
 pass the word raphael you will tell us 

00:03:09.250 --> 00:03:13.810
 a little bit more about the difficulties of this 

00:03:11.320 --> 00:03:16.330
 test then I come from the course of 

00:03:13.810 --> 00:03:18.070
 open it a lot of difficulties the 

00:03:16.330 --> 00:03:19.930
 mud rain as you can see 

00:03:18.070 --> 00:03:21.610
 Here I not avoid the puddles g 

00:03:19.930 --> 00:03:24.540
 difficult to avoid them and difficult 

00:03:21.610 --> 00:03:27.160
 to avoid the mud nice course even 

00:03:24.540 --> 00:03:28.240
 nevertheless and people will take 

00:03:27.160 --> 00:03:30.040
 a lot of fun what we take 

00:03:28.240 --> 00:03:32.230
 a lot of fun on this course I 

00:03:30.040 --> 00:03:33.130
 go back to the word manu that's it then we
