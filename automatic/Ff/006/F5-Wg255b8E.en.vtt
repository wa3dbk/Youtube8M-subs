00:00:11.209 --> 00:00:11.219 
up my specimen bikes by adding some

00:00:11.219 --> 00:00:13.820 
up my specimen bikes by adding some
exhausts<00:00:11.730> pipes<00:00:12.660> here<00:00:13.320> is<00:00:13.410> the<00:00:13.500> first<00:00:13.679> thing<00:00:13.740> I

exhausts pipes here is the first thing I

00:00:13.830 --> 00:00:15.499 
exhausts pipes here is the first thing I
did<00:00:13.920> was<00:00:14.099> I<00:00:14.219> took<00:00:14.280> a<00:00:14.400> pushpin<00:00:14.790> and<00:00:14.969> I<00:00:15.299> poked

00:00:15.499 --> 00:00:15.509 
did was I took a pushpin and I poked

00:00:15.509 --> 00:00:17.510 
did was I took a pushpin and I poked
some<00:00:15.660> holes<00:00:15.719> which<00:00:16.440> will<00:00:16.590> help<00:00:16.710> but<00:00:16.890> guide<00:00:17.070> me

00:00:17.510 --> 00:00:17.520 
some holes which will help but guide me

00:00:17.520 --> 00:00:21.920 
some holes which will help but guide me
in<00:00:17.760> drilling<00:00:18.180> out<00:00:18.240> my<00:00:18.330> pilot<00:00:18.630> holes<00:00:20.810> made<00:00:21.810> sure

00:00:21.920 --> 00:00:21.930 
in drilling out my pilot holes made sure

00:00:21.930 --> 00:00:23.300 
in drilling out my pilot holes made sure
that<00:00:22.050> I<00:00:22.109> put<00:00:22.320> those<00:00:22.439> basically<00:00:22.920> right<00:00:23.130> in<00:00:23.160> the

00:00:23.300 --> 00:00:23.310 
that I put those basically right in the

00:00:23.310 --> 00:00:25.849 
that I put those basically right in the
middle<00:00:23.460> and<00:00:23.730> then<00:00:24.300> I<00:00:24.330> took<00:00:24.510> my<00:00:24.660> pin<00:00:24.930> vise<00:00:25.109> and<00:00:25.350> I

00:00:25.849 --> 00:00:25.859 
middle and then I took my pin vise and I

00:00:25.859 --> 00:00:27.500 
middle and then I took my pin vise and I
drilled<00:00:26.189> out<00:00:26.340> a<00:00:26.550> pilot<00:00:26.849> small<00:00:27.150> pilot<00:00:27.390> hole

00:00:27.500 --> 00:00:27.510 
drilled out a pilot small pilot hole

00:00:27.510 --> 00:00:29.720 
drilled out a pilot small pilot hole
right<00:00:27.810> in<00:00:27.960> the<00:00:27.990> center<00:00:28.320> of<00:00:28.470> each<00:00:29.250> of<00:00:29.279> the

00:00:29.720 --> 00:00:29.730 
right in the center of each of the

00:00:29.730 --> 00:00:32.479 
right in the center of each of the
completely<00:00:30.210> flat<00:00:30.510> exhaust<00:00:31.199> ports<00:00:31.529> I've

00:00:32.479 --> 00:00:32.489 
completely flat exhaust ports I've

00:00:32.489 --> 00:00:34.370 
completely flat exhaust ports I've
always<00:00:32.759> found<00:00:32.880> the<00:00:33.030> specimen<00:00:33.390> bike<00:00:33.630> to<00:00:33.989> be<00:00:34.079> one

00:00:34.370 --> 00:00:34.380 
always found the specimen bike to be one

00:00:34.380 --> 00:00:36.139 
always found the specimen bike to be one
of<00:00:34.500> the<00:00:34.590> least<00:00:35.070> interesting<00:00:35.640> looking<00:00:35.880> space

00:00:36.139 --> 00:00:36.149 
of the least interesting looking space

00:00:36.149 --> 00:00:38.030 
of the least interesting looking space
rain<00:00:36.360> kits<00:00:36.719> I've<00:00:37.380> just<00:00:37.649> found<00:00:37.739> it<00:00:37.890> never

00:00:38.030 --> 00:00:38.040 
rain kits I've just found it never

00:00:38.040 --> 00:00:41.090 
rain kits I've just found it never
particularly<00:00:38.760> appealing<00:00:39.030> but<00:00:39.780> now<00:00:40.050> that<00:00:40.770> 7th

00:00:41.090 --> 00:00:41.100 
particularly appealing but now that 7th

00:00:41.100 --> 00:00:43.130 
particularly appealing but now that 7th
edition<00:00:41.160> is<00:00:41.460> made<00:00:41.489> bikes<00:00:41.850> pretty<00:00:42.270> darn<00:00:42.629> sweet

00:00:43.130 --> 00:00:43.140 
edition is made bikes pretty darn sweet

00:00:43.140 --> 00:00:45.500 
edition is made bikes pretty darn sweet
I<00:00:43.590> am<00:00:44.070> adding<00:00:44.430> a<00:00:44.460> couple<00:00:44.700> to<00:00:44.760> my<00:00:44.879> army<00:00:45.059> and<00:00:45.210> that

00:00:45.500 --> 00:00:45.510 
I am adding a couple to my army and that

00:00:45.510 --> 00:00:52.790 
I am adding a couple to my army and that
is<00:00:45.629> what<00:00:45.750> prompted<00:00:45.899> this<00:00:46.289> video<00:00:51.620> now<00:00:52.620> that<00:00:52.739> I

00:00:52.790 --> 00:00:52.800 
is what prompted this video now that I

00:00:52.800 --> 00:00:54.470 
is what prompted this video now that I
have<00:00:52.949> all<00:00:53.219> my<00:00:53.250> pilot<00:00:53.670> holes<00:00:53.699> drilled<00:00:54.120> out<00:00:54.210> and

00:00:54.470 --> 00:00:54.480 
have all my pilot holes drilled out and

00:00:54.480 --> 00:00:58.639 
have all my pilot holes drilled out and
then<00:00:54.989> moved<00:00:55.230> on<00:00:55.469> to<00:00:56.250> the<00:00:56.940> big<00:00:57.120> boy<00:00:57.270> drill<00:00:57.539> and<00:00:57.809> I

00:00:58.639 --> 00:00:58.649 
then moved on to the big boy drill and I

00:00:58.649 --> 00:01:06.140 
then moved on to the big boy drill and I
proceeded<00:00:59.070> to<00:00:59.250> drill<00:00:59.670> out<00:01:00.109> details

00:01:06.140 --> 00:01:06.150 

00:01:06.150 --> 00:01:08.130 

now<00:01:07.150> the<00:01:07.240> reason<00:01:07.570> that<00:01:07.600> we<00:01:07.720> drilled<00:01:07.870> a<00:01:07.990> pal

00:01:08.130 --> 00:01:08.140 
now the reason that we drilled a pal

00:01:08.140 --> 00:01:09.480 
now the reason that we drilled a pal
hole<00:01:08.350> is<00:01:08.530> just<00:01:08.560> to<00:01:08.740> make<00:01:08.860> sure<00:01:08.890> that<00:01:09.190> the<00:01:09.310> drill

00:01:09.480 --> 00:01:09.490 
hole is just to make sure that the drill

00:01:09.490 --> 00:01:11.340 
hole is just to make sure that the drill
didn't<00:01:09.760> slip<00:01:10.000> and<00:01:10.210> cut<00:01:10.480> into<00:01:10.690> the<00:01:10.840> plastic<00:01:11.230> or

00:01:11.340 --> 00:01:11.350 
didn't slip and cut into the plastic or

00:01:11.350 --> 00:01:12.960 
didn't slip and cut into the plastic or
remove<00:01:11.800> any<00:01:11.980> of<00:01:12.070> the<00:01:12.160> details<00:01:12.520> that<00:01:12.730> we<00:01:12.790> want

00:01:12.960 --> 00:01:12.970 
remove any of the details that we want

00:01:12.970 --> 00:01:17.340 
remove any of the details that we want
to<00:01:13.420> keep<00:01:15.090> now<00:01:16.090> that<00:01:16.270> I<00:01:16.300> have<00:01:16.450> my<00:01:16.630> holes<00:01:16.840> drilled

00:01:17.340 --> 00:01:17.350 
to keep now that I have my holes drilled

00:01:17.350 --> 00:01:19.830 
to keep now that I have my holes drilled
out<00:01:17.410> I<00:01:17.680> then<00:01:18.130> begin<00:01:18.430> to<00:01:19.030> add<00:01:19.210> my<00:01:19.600> coffee

00:01:19.830 --> 00:01:19.840 
out I then begin to add my coffee

00:01:19.840 --> 00:01:21.180 
out I then begin to add my coffee
stirrers<00:01:20.230> these<00:01:20.530> are<00:01:20.620> gonna<00:01:20.710> be<00:01:20.830> acting<00:01:20.950> as

00:01:21.180 --> 00:01:21.190 
stirrers these are gonna be acting as

00:01:21.190 --> 00:01:24.000 
stirrers these are gonna be acting as
the<00:01:21.220> pipe<00:01:21.490> so<00:01:22.450> just<00:01:22.630> stick<00:01:23.170> them<00:01:23.290> into<00:01:23.890> the

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:24.010 
the pipe so just stick them into the

00:01:24.010 --> 00:01:28.200 
the pipe so just stick them into the
holes<00:01:24.220> that<00:01:24.280> we<00:01:24.370> just<00:01:24.430> made<00:01:26.010> and<00:01:27.010> now<00:01:27.910> you<00:01:27.970> have

00:01:28.200 --> 00:01:28.210 
holes that we just made and now you have

00:01:28.210 --> 00:01:29.580 
holes that we just made and now you have
some<00:01:28.420> more<00:01:28.540> appropriate<00:01:28.990> looking<00:01:29.230> exhaust

00:01:29.580 --> 00:01:29.590 
some more appropriate looking exhaust

00:01:29.590 --> 00:01:31.980 
some more appropriate looking exhaust
ports<00:01:30.060> however<00:01:31.060> if<00:01:31.240> you're<00:01:31.360> not<00:01:31.390> happy<00:01:31.780> with

00:01:31.980 --> 00:01:31.990 
ports however if you're not happy with

00:01:31.990 --> 00:01:33.900 
ports however if you're not happy with
the<00:01:32.170> current<00:01:32.320> size<00:01:32.740> of<00:01:33.010> them<00:01:33.130> as<00:01:33.610> you<00:01:33.700> can<00:01:33.730> see

00:01:33.900 --> 00:01:33.910 
the current size of them as you can see

00:01:33.910 --> 00:01:36.150 
the current size of them as you can see
these<00:01:34.060> are<00:01:34.210> a<00:01:34.240> bit<00:01:34.480> long<00:01:34.720> you<00:01:35.650> can<00:01:35.830> then<00:01:35.950> take

00:01:36.150 --> 00:01:36.160 
these are a bit long you can then take

00:01:36.160 --> 00:01:38.460 
these are a bit long you can then take
any<00:01:36.490> type<00:01:37.120> of<00:01:37.150> cutter<00:01:37.450> or<00:01:37.750> scissors<00:01:37.930> and<00:01:38.290> trim

00:01:38.460 --> 00:01:38.470 
any type of cutter or scissors and trim

00:01:38.470 --> 00:01:40.770 
any type of cutter or scissors and trim
them<00:01:38.680> I<00:01:38.950> decided<00:01:39.820> to<00:01:39.940> go<00:01:40.030> with<00:01:40.180> have<00:01:40.300> an<00:01:40.450> angled

00:01:40.770 --> 00:01:40.780 
them I decided to go with have an angled

00:01:40.780 --> 00:01:43.140 
them I decided to go with have an angled
look<00:01:40.990> I<00:01:41.490> thought<00:01:42.490> it<00:01:42.580> looked<00:01:42.670> pretty<00:01:42.940> darn

00:01:43.140 --> 00:01:43.150 
look I thought it looked pretty darn

00:01:43.150 --> 00:01:47.310 
look I thought it looked pretty darn
sweet<00:01:43.540> and<00:01:45.570> if<00:01:46.570> you<00:01:46.720> end<00:01:46.870> up<00:01:46.930> cutting<00:01:47.110> them<00:01:47.290> a

00:01:47.310 --> 00:01:47.320 
sweet and if you end up cutting them a

00:01:47.320 --> 00:01:48.930 
sweet and if you end up cutting them a
little<00:01:47.590> bit<00:01:47.680> too<00:01:47.800> long<00:01:48.070> or<00:01:48.250> too<00:01:48.400> short<00:01:48.430> you<00:01:48.790> can

00:01:48.930 --> 00:01:48.940 
little bit too long or too short you can

00:01:48.940 --> 00:01:52.230 
little bit too long or too short you can
always<00:01:49.710> push<00:01:50.710> them<00:01:50.890> farther<00:01:51.310> into<00:01:51.640> or<00:01:52.030> pull

00:01:52.230 --> 00:01:52.240 
always push them farther into or pull

00:01:52.240 --> 00:01:53.550 
always push them farther into or pull
them<00:01:52.330> outside<00:01:52.540> of<00:01:52.780> the<00:01:53.200> holes<00:01:53.380> that<00:01:53.470> we

00:01:53.550 --> 00:01:53.560 
them outside of the holes that we

00:01:53.560 --> 00:01:55.500 
them outside of the holes that we
drilled<00:01:53.700> there<00:01:54.700> you<00:01:54.790> have<00:01:54.970> some<00:01:55.000> pretty

00:01:55.500 --> 00:01:55.510 
drilled there you have some pretty

00:01:55.510 --> 00:02:06.270 
drilled there you have some pretty
sweet-looking<00:01:55.930> exhaust<00:01:56.440> I<00:02:04.950> hope<00:02:05.950> you<00:02:06.070> enjoyed

00:02:06.270 --> 00:02:06.280 
sweet-looking exhaust I hope you enjoyed
