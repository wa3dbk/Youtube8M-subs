00:04:01.660 --> 00:04:01.670 
I sent home I leave them a bottle of

00:04:01.670 --> 00:04:03.250 
I sent home I leave them a bottle of
less<00:04:01.940> than<00:04:01.970> a<00:04:02.150> half<00:04:02.209> an<00:04:02.450> ounce<00:04:02.570> of<00:04:02.750> meds

00:04:03.250 --> 00:04:03.260 
less than a half an ounce of meds

00:04:03.260 --> 00:04:05.680 
less than a half an ounce of meds
and<00:04:03.440> then<00:04:03.709> they<00:04:03.830> gave<00:04:04.010> her<00:04:04.130> this<00:04:04.690> humongous

00:04:05.680 --> 00:04:05.690 
and then they gave her this humongous

00:04:05.690 --> 00:04:08.110 
and then they gave her this humongous
amount<00:04:05.990> of<00:04:06.080> meds<00:04:06.290> here<00:04:06.560> so<00:04:07.130> according<00:04:07.970> to<00:04:08.000> my

00:04:08.110 --> 00:04:08.120 
amount of meds here so according to my

00:04:08.120 --> 00:04:09.610 
amount of meds here so according to my
calculations<00:04:08.900> you<00:04:09.080> would<00:04:09.200> have<00:04:09.350> to<00:04:09.470> give

00:04:09.610 --> 00:04:09.620 
calculations you would have to give

00:04:09.620 --> 00:04:12.520 
calculations you would have to give
three<00:04:09.950> times<00:04:10.370> the<00:04:10.700> dose<00:04:10.910> of<00:04:11.180> this<00:04:11.530> this

00:04:12.520 --> 00:04:12.530 
three times the dose of this this

00:04:12.530 --> 00:04:14.230 
three times the dose of this this
formulation<00:04:13.130> which<00:04:13.430> is<00:04:13.580> too<00:04:13.730> big<00:04:13.880> for<00:04:13.940> this

00:04:14.230 --> 00:04:14.240 
formulation which is too big for this

00:04:14.240 --> 00:04:15.940 
formulation which is too big for this
girl's<00:04:14.480> stomach<00:04:14.690> to<00:04:15.020> get<00:04:15.110> the<00:04:15.230> same<00:04:15.440> effect<00:04:15.800> so

00:04:15.940 --> 00:04:15.950 
girl's stomach to get the same effect so

00:04:15.950 --> 00:04:17.140 
girl's stomach to get the same effect so
today<00:04:16.280> we're<00:04:16.430> going<00:04:16.519> to<00:04:16.609> make<00:04:16.760> a<00:04:16.790> whole<00:04:17.030> new

00:04:17.140 --> 00:04:17.150 
today we're going to make a whole new

00:04:17.150 --> 00:04:20.170 
today we're going to make a whole new
bet<00:04:17.680> but<00:04:18.680> what's<00:04:18.829> funny<00:04:18.950> is<00:04:19.220> you<00:04:19.489> can<00:04:20.000> actually

00:04:20.170 --> 00:04:20.180 
bet but what's funny is you can actually

00:04:20.180 --> 00:04:22.030 
bet but what's funny is you can actually
tell<00:04:20.419> the<00:04:20.510> difference<00:04:20.870> between<00:04:20.989> the<00:04:21.230> old<00:04:21.380> old

00:04:22.030 --> 00:04:22.040 
tell the difference between the old old

00:04:22.040 --> 00:04:24.790 
tell the difference between the old old
swirl<00:04:22.460> in<00:04:22.910> the<00:04:23.300> new<00:04:23.390> squirrel<00:04:23.720> wait<00:04:24.470> a<00:04:24.530> minute

00:04:24.790 --> 00:04:24.800 
swirl in the new squirrel wait a minute

00:04:24.800 --> 00:04:26.890 
swirl in the new squirrel wait a minute
this<00:04:25.070> should<00:04:25.370> not<00:04:25.550> be<00:04:25.730> the<00:04:26.000> new<00:04:26.120> world<00:04:26.570> anyway

00:04:26.890 --> 00:04:26.900 
this should not be the new world anyway

00:04:26.900 --> 00:04:28.300 
this should not be the new world anyway
so<00:04:26.960> we're<00:04:27.169> gonna<00:04:27.260> try<00:04:27.440> the<00:04:27.530> new<00:04:27.710> meds<00:04:27.919> all<00:04:28.100> over

00:04:28.300 --> 00:04:28.310 
so we're gonna try the new meds all over

00:04:28.310 --> 00:04:32.430 
so we're gonna try the new meds all over
again<00:04:28.450> seem<00:04:29.450> to<00:04:29.570> make<00:04:29.660> a<00:04:29.720> difference<00:04:31.330> and

00:04:32.430 --> 00:04:32.440 
again seem to make a difference and

00:04:32.440 --> 00:04:35.380 
again seem to make a difference and
hopefully<00:04:33.440> the<00:04:33.590> next<00:04:33.890> next<00:04:34.850> video<00:04:35.150> we<00:04:35.240> see

00:04:35.380 --> 00:04:35.390 
hopefully the next next video we see

00:04:35.390 --> 00:04:36.760 
hopefully the next next video we see
this<00:04:35.480> guy<00:04:35.660> won't<00:04:35.870> be<00:04:36.020> or<00:04:36.169> bounce<00:04:36.410> around<00:04:36.560> like

00:04:36.760 --> 00:04:36.770 
this guy won't be or bounce around like

00:04:36.770 --> 00:04:39.700 
this guy won't be or bounce around like
she<00:04:36.919> was<00:04:37.040> the<00:04:37.190> last<00:04:37.400> time<00:04:37.610> so<00:04:38.480> anyway<00:04:38.750> we're

00:04:39.700 --> 00:04:39.710 
she was the last time so anyway we're

00:04:39.710 --> 00:04:42.100 
she was the last time so anyway we're
we're<00:04:40.490> still<00:04:40.610> hanging<00:04:41.000> in<00:04:41.090> there<00:04:41.150> this<00:04:41.660> is<00:04:41.870> one

00:04:42.100 --> 00:04:42.110 
we're still hanging in there this is one

00:04:42.110 --> 00:04:43.330 
we're still hanging in there this is one
of<00:04:42.169> those<00:04:42.260> really<00:04:42.560> cool<00:04:42.710> cases<00:04:43.160> when<00:04:43.310> we

00:04:43.330 --> 00:04:43.340 
of those really cool cases when we

00:04:43.340 --> 00:04:44.830 
of those really cool cases when we
figure<00:04:43.700> this<00:04:43.850> out<00:04:44.060> we<00:04:44.120> could<00:04:44.330> probably<00:04:44.570> save

00:04:44.830 --> 00:04:44.840 
figure this out we could probably save

00:04:44.840 --> 00:04:47.500 
figure this out we could probably save
thousands<00:04:45.440> of<00:04:45.560> square<00:04:45.740> in<00:04:46.040> the<00:04:46.100> future<00:04:46.430> so<00:04:46.730> I'm

00:06:18.120 --> 00:06:18.130 
hoping it's just basing the antibiotic

00:06:18.130 --> 00:06:20.640 
hoping it's just basing the antibiotic
dose<00:06:18.310> anyway<00:06:19.060> from<00:06:19.330> there<00:06:19.570> back<00:06:19.990> to<00:06:20.110> here
