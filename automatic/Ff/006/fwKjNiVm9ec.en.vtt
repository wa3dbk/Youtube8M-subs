this is a very simple video to explain

00:00:02.429 --> 00:00:06.650 
this is a very simple video to explain
how<00:00:02.700> to<00:00:02.879> put<00:00:03.330> holes<00:00:04.200> and<00:00:04.790> pins<00:00:05.790> through<00:00:06.480> a

00:00:06.650 --> 00:00:06.660 
how to put holes and pins through a

00:00:06.660 --> 00:00:09.049 
how to put holes and pins through a
quilt<00:00:06.930> pendant<00:00:07.589> it<00:00:08.130> really<00:00:08.400> is<00:00:08.580> very<00:00:08.610> very

00:00:09.049 --> 00:00:09.059 
quilt pendant it really is very very

00:00:09.059 --> 00:00:11.089 
quilt pendant it really is very very
simple<00:00:09.450> so<00:00:10.139> here<00:00:10.170> I'm<00:00:10.469> using<00:00:10.650> one<00:00:10.950> of<00:00:10.980> the

00:00:11.089 --> 00:00:11.099 
simple so here I'm using one of the

00:00:11.099 --> 00:00:12.320 
simple so here I'm using one of the
pendants<00:00:11.400> which<00:00:11.580> has<00:00:11.700> gone<00:00:11.849> bad

00:00:12.320 --> 00:00:12.330 
pendants which has gone bad

00:00:12.330 --> 00:00:15.620 
pendants which has gone bad
now<00:00:13.170> select<00:00:13.500> the<00:00:14.099> point<00:00:14.400> where<00:00:15.030> you<00:00:15.179> want<00:00:15.420> to

00:00:15.620 --> 00:00:15.630

needle tool or a needle itself through

00:00:23.189 --> 00:00:24.380 
needle tool or a needle itself through
neither<00:00:23.550> tools<00:00:23.820> are<00:00:23.970> more<00:00:24.060> convenient

00:00:24.380 --> 00:00:24.390 
neither tools are more convenient

00:00:24.390 --> 00:00:28.310 
neither tools are more convenient
because<00:00:24.600> they<00:00:24.810> have<00:00:24.930> a<00:00:24.960> nice<00:00:25.199> handle<00:00:27.050> go<00:00:28.050> in

00:00:28.310 --> 00:00:28.320 
because they have a nice handle go in

00:00:28.320 --> 00:00:32.150 
because they have a nice handle go in
circular<00:00:28.650> motion<00:00:29.519> don't<00:00:30.060> just<00:00:30.599> push<00:00:31.160> this

00:00:32.150 --> 00:00:32.160 
circular motion don't just push this

00:00:32.160 --> 00:00:34.340 
circular motion don't just push this
will<00:00:32.369> reduce<00:00:32.550> the<00:00:32.700> stress<00:00:33.000> felt<00:00:33.630> by<00:00:34.290> the

00:01:30.429 --> 00:01:30.439 
I'm going to put it through this wire

00:01:30.439 --> 00:01:33.679 
I'm going to put it through this wire
and<00:01:31.439> bring<00:01:31.650> it<00:01:31.770> here<00:01:31.979> like<00:01:32.220> this<00:01:32.329> now<00:01:33.329> you<00:01:33.390> can

00:01:33.679 --> 00:01:33.689 
and bring it here like this now you can

00:01:33.689 --> 00:01:34.910 
and bring it here like this now you can
see<00:01:33.900> that<00:01:34.079> it's<00:01:34.200> sitting<00:01:34.409> very<00:01:34.710> nicely

00:01:34.910 --> 00:01:34.920 
see that it's sitting very nicely

00:01:34.920 --> 00:01:38.270 
see that it's sitting very nicely
independent<00:01:36.530> now<00:01:37.530> you<00:01:37.619> can<00:01:37.799> put<00:01:37.979> any

00:01:38.270 --> 00:01:38.280 
independent now you can put any

00:01:38.280 --> 00:01:40.640 
independent now you can put any
additional<00:01:38.909> beads<00:01:39.180> that<00:01:39.960> you<00:01:40.020> want<00:01:40.380> to<00:01:40.500> do

00:01:40.640 --> 00:01:40.650 
additional beads that you want to do

00:01:40.650 --> 00:01:45.190 
additional beads that you want to do
like<00:01:41.610> this<00:01:42.350> break<00:01:43.350> it<00:01:43.500> off<00:01:43.619> at<00:01:44.490> about<00:01:44.729> this

00:01:45.190 --> 00:01:45.200 
like this break it off at about this

00:01:45.200 --> 00:01:48.980 
like this break it off at about this
this<00:01:46.200> much<00:01:46.770> always<00:01:47.399> keep<00:01:47.820> extra<00:01:47.970> just<00:01:48.810> in<00:01:48.930> case

00:01:48.980 --> 00:01:48.990 
this much always keep extra just in case

00:01:48.990 --> 00:01:50.510 
this much always keep extra just in case
you<00:01:49.290> need<00:01:49.439> to<00:01:49.470> cut<00:01:49.770> it<00:01:49.799> off<00:01:49.979> you<00:01:50.009> can<00:01:50.310> always

00:01:50.510 --> 00:01:50.520 
you need to cut it off you can always

00:01:50.520 --> 00:01:52.840 
you need to cut it off you can always
make<00:01:51.149> it<00:01:51.270> shorter<00:01:51.570> later

00:01:52.840 --> 00:01:52.850 
make it shorter later

00:01:52.850 --> 00:01:56.990 
make it shorter later
now<00:01:53.850> we<00:01:54.240> reinforce<00:01:54.780> the<00:01:54.960> position<00:01:55.520> and<00:01:56.520> then<00:01:56.759> I

00:01:56.990 --> 00:01:57.000 
now we reinforce the position and then I

00:01:57.000 --> 00:02:00.170 
now we reinforce the position and then I
just<00:01:57.360> give<00:01:57.600> it<00:01:57.719> a<00:01:57.780> gentle<00:01:57.930> looping<00:01:59.030> if<00:02:00.030> you

00:02:00.170 --> 00:02:00.180 
just give it a gentle looping if you

00:02:00.180 --> 00:02:01.880 
just give it a gentle looping if you
want<00:02:00.390> you<00:02:00.540> can<00:02:00.689> add<00:02:00.810> a<00:02:00.869> pendant<00:02:01.290> clip<00:02:01.590> or<00:02:01.860> a
