00:00:07.900 --> 00:00:11.630
 Hello and welcome to one 

00:00:10.040 --> 00:00:14.299
 new following from deco kitchen 

00:00:11.630 --> 00:00:16.070
 Today is autumnal outside is yes 

00:00:14.299 --> 00:00:17.990
 Alone cooler and the days 

00:00:16.070 --> 00:00:19.730
 are getting shorter and therefore thought 

00:00:17.990 --> 00:00:21.740
 I look now I just took time to 

00:00:19.730 --> 00:00:23.720
 already with the first herbstdeko me 

00:00:21.740 --> 00:00:26.509
 Hope you enjoy it and I'm happy 

00:00:23.720 --> 00:00:28.339
 on it for the production of ours 

00:00:26.509 --> 00:00:30.650
 ornaments so the mushrooms and the 

00:00:28.339 --> 00:00:34.820
 scroll and I'll take it here now 

00:00:30.650 --> 00:00:36.410
 a doctor sorry for him says there you can 

00:00:34.820 --> 00:00:38.750
 of course take other knetmasse here 

00:00:36.410 --> 00:00:40.730
 he likes to be most skilful 

00:00:38.750 --> 00:00:42.620
 it is an increasing white already then 

00:00:40.730 --> 00:00:44.390
 it saves you time for mine 

00:00:42.620 --> 00:00:46.570
 mushrooms I cut my small at first 

00:00:44.390 --> 00:00:46.570
 here 

00:00:48.309 --> 00:00:51.469
 depending on how big you make the mushrooms 

00:00:50.809 --> 00:00:53.930
 would like to 

00:00:51.469 --> 00:00:55.039
 that's about two centimeters well with 

00:00:53.930 --> 00:00:58.210
 this is what I already put out there 

00:00:55.039 --> 00:01:08.960
 I have big and then I could do that 

00:00:58.210 --> 00:01:11.890
 whole a bit off that's possible 

00:01:08.960 --> 00:01:11.890
 reason becomes 

00:01:16.800 --> 00:01:25.180
 now to make the top of the mushroom 

00:01:23.190 --> 00:01:27.100
 I go here now a bit 

00:01:25.180 --> 00:01:33.820
 be careful that means I squeezed it 

00:01:27.100 --> 00:01:34.560
 a bit from I express to 

00:01:33.820 --> 00:01:40.630
 below 

00:01:34.560 --> 00:01:42.730
 flat of course if you like different 

00:01:40.630 --> 00:01:45.130
 makes begrudge any time do differently 

00:01:42.730 --> 00:01:47.950
 she is about out and now I take 

00:01:45.130 --> 00:01:51.220
 this down here so if the crowd 

00:01:47.950 --> 00:01:52.479
 By the way, just this sorry or 3 

00:01:51.220 --> 00:01:54.930
 but that will probably be longer if you can 

00:01:52.479 --> 00:01:57.190
 open even though you have it in 

00:01:54.930 --> 00:01:57.970
 fresh foil then packs 

00:01:57.190 --> 00:01:59.260
 a bit dry 

00:01:57.970 --> 00:02:01.030
 and you can do it a bit 

00:01:59.260 --> 00:02:02.979
 take water here and know about it 

00:02:01.030 --> 00:02:05.410
 go and it will be back 

00:02:02.979 --> 00:02:07.930
 so it is a wet leaves then 

00:02:05.410 --> 00:02:09.880
 work well on it again 

00:02:07.930 --> 00:02:11.170
 get typical mushroom I do 

00:02:09.880 --> 00:02:13.510
 always so i go through this 

00:02:11.170 --> 00:02:21.610
 between her hands the fingers are stuck and 

00:02:13.510 --> 00:02:23.140
 then the head here so underline that 

00:02:21.610 --> 00:02:25.900
 is a bit tastier and so 

00:02:23.140 --> 00:02:27.250
 emotional thing but with me should be so 

00:02:25.900 --> 00:02:33.910
 a bit overlap the mushroom 

00:02:27.250 --> 00:02:36.040
 that's why I 'm going to go over this now 

00:02:33.910 --> 00:02:39.040
 I'm doing kind of passes like this 

00:02:36.040 --> 00:02:42.780
 about four pieces depending on how big 

00:02:39.040 --> 00:02:45.220
 then it's on the ground 

00:02:42.780 --> 00:02:47.440
 Decorated and what's important to me 

00:02:45.220 --> 00:02:48.970
 so it's a bit of a dynamic 

00:02:47.440 --> 00:02:50.500
 that's when you get the mushrooms 

00:02:48.970 --> 00:02:51.760
 just makes different sizes 

00:02:50.500 --> 00:02:53.380
 that means I 'm doing this now 

00:02:51.760 --> 00:02:55.870
 a bigger mushroom is mine here 

00:02:53.380 --> 00:03:01.180
 three mushrooms ready and now it is still working 

00:02:55.870 --> 00:03:02.739
 to make the leaves for the 

00:03:01.180 --> 00:03:04.670
 I also just cut myself leaves 

00:03:02.739 --> 00:03:09.470
 here a piece off 

00:03:04.670 --> 00:03:15.650
 to approximate cm wide so after I 

00:03:09.470 --> 00:03:16.610
 that kneaded well first 

00:03:15.650 --> 00:03:19.489
 Press flat 

00:03:16.610 --> 00:03:20.900
 I need that very flat that has 

00:03:19.489 --> 00:03:23.900
 I just realized I do not have any 

00:03:20.900 --> 00:03:24.520
 noodles wood but a wine bottle does it 

00:03:23.900 --> 00:03:34.970
 also 

00:03:24.520 --> 00:03:37.519
 and with that, I have it now 

00:03:34.970 --> 00:03:40.430
 that's about to say rolled out 

00:03:37.519 --> 00:03:43.250
 so 12 millimeters thick and now take 

00:03:40.430 --> 00:03:47.769
 i am also this piece again 

00:03:43.250 --> 00:03:52.760
 michael sheet and at the edge of it 

00:03:47.769 --> 00:03:58.010
 Now I cut the noodle the us 

00:03:52.760 --> 00:03:59.810
 Just make it so I have the leaf now 

00:03:58.010 --> 00:04:02.870
 triggered here it still has 

00:03:59.810 --> 00:04:05.269
 relatively hard edges and there I go 

00:04:02.870 --> 00:04:06.530
 Now carefully with water over it and 

00:04:05.269 --> 00:04:09.200
 Just do it here 

00:04:06.530 --> 00:04:12.079
 a little bit the same dog and to say one 

00:04:09.200 --> 00:04:15.650
 a little bit that it edges more 

00:04:12.079 --> 00:04:21.440
 gets from the water fingers and go 

00:04:15.650 --> 00:04:25.310
 then over the edges over it and thereby 

00:04:21.440 --> 00:04:27.050
 they will be so in the now 

00:04:25.310 --> 00:04:29.479
 kanten here already delegated hoffmann 

00:04:27.050 --> 00:04:30.890
 sees it reasonably and now because 

00:04:29.479 --> 00:04:32.660
 the whole thing has a bit of structure 

00:04:30.890 --> 00:04:36.500
 So a sheet is synonymous yes 

00:04:32.660 --> 00:04:39.830
 Blades just go carefully 

00:04:36.500 --> 00:04:44.890
 with a knife that can also do one 

00:04:39.830 --> 00:04:47.390
 Take another object along here 

00:04:44.890 --> 00:04:52.000
 of the sheet and just sign me in 

00:04:47.390 --> 00:04:56.060
 few veins 1 whom the lines with the 

00:04:52.000 --> 00:04:58.080
 you can hardly see the knife too fine 

00:04:56.060 --> 00:04:59.729
 can also just down here 

00:04:58.080 --> 00:05:01.650
 For example, I have the back of 

00:04:59.729 --> 00:05:04.199
 a brush and I do well in 

00:05:01.650 --> 00:05:07.319
 water up here and then I go 

00:05:04.199 --> 00:05:10.650
 here again the line after and thereby 

00:05:07.319 --> 00:05:12.539
 I get a bigger line one 

00:05:10.650 --> 00:05:19.199
 Of course later then even more 

00:05:12.539 --> 00:05:21.810
 looks like the wider now 

00:05:19.199 --> 00:05:24.240
 lines from the leaves are now ready 

00:05:21.810 --> 00:05:26.610
 Today , this is considered quite hard 

00:05:24.240 --> 00:05:29.189
 short microwave and just that with the 

00:05:26.610 --> 00:05:30.539
 mushrooms out the pro variant I give her 

00:05:29.189 --> 00:05:32.190
 I want to show myself here 

00:05:30.539 --> 00:05:34.139
 brought slate board that goes of course 

00:05:32.190 --> 00:05:36.419
 also with other documents that you can 

00:05:34.139 --> 00:05:38.580
 super beautiful apple or take 

00:05:36.419 --> 00:05:41.280
 maybe what i know shows that 

00:05:38.580 --> 00:05:43.229
 afterwards again in the end and around 

00:05:41.280 --> 00:05:44.969
 to fix the mushrooms now, namely 

00:05:43.229 --> 00:05:47.849
 simply double sided tape because 

00:05:44.969 --> 00:05:51.330
 that would otherwise fall over because of the head 

00:05:47.849 --> 00:05:53.520
 has heavier but that can be short 

00:05:51.330 --> 00:05:56.159
 attach it and then can 

00:05:53.520 --> 00:06:00.020
 wonderful after the decoration if you 

00:05:56.159 --> 00:06:02.460
 clean up again 

00:06:00.020 --> 00:06:05.449
 the three places I have now sticks 

00:06:02.460 --> 00:06:08.580
 guests are so good and i am here 

00:06:05.449 --> 00:06:10.620
 this island where that is now 

00:06:08.580 --> 00:06:12.930
 a little bit horrible because I give it to him 

00:06:10.620 --> 00:06:16.650
 Now do not think so about the black 

00:06:12.930 --> 00:06:19.949
 have green today and decorate me 

00:06:16.650 --> 00:06:23.180
 now about the mushrooms and there too 

00:06:19.949 --> 00:06:26.250
 as flat as possible, so to speak, in the 

00:06:23.180 --> 00:06:27.810
 Moss stand that must be here now 

00:06:26.250 --> 00:06:29.279
 I spread a little bit on the plate 

00:06:27.810 --> 00:06:31.620
 I do not have it on purpose now 

00:06:29.279 --> 00:06:35.990
 filled in and now I take the 

00:06:31.620 --> 00:06:35.990
 leaves and depending on taste 

00:06:36.080 --> 00:06:41.659
 Defended a bit now 

00:06:38.729 --> 00:06:44.400
 the plate I think that's looks 

00:06:41.659 --> 00:06:46.710
 Everyone can do that , of course 

00:06:44.400 --> 00:06:52.139
 wants to recognize that means she pushes 

00:06:46.710 --> 00:06:56.029
 which is a bit below so now 

00:06:52.139 --> 00:06:59.580
 I have different ones 

00:06:56.029 --> 00:07:01.770
 and a few more small and tap 

00:06:59.580 --> 00:07:05.310
 I got them now, too 

00:07:01.770 --> 00:07:05.810
 but still only a few should yes 

00:07:05.310 --> 00:07:08.990
 Not 

00:07:05.810 --> 00:07:10.940
 answer so it is finished now 

00:07:08.990 --> 00:07:12.110
 how I have decorated I have now 

00:07:10.940 --> 00:07:14.360
 Here are just a few recognize and this 

00:07:12.110 --> 00:07:16.639
 mini has dancing and have made it 

00:07:14.360 --> 00:07:18.200
 it is a bit distributed community 

00:07:16.639 --> 00:07:19.460
 Do not overweight the relationship now 

00:07:18.200 --> 00:07:20.080
 Of course anyone can do it like him 

00:07:19.460 --> 00:07:23.360
 would like to 

00:07:20.080 --> 00:07:23.990
 and yes this is my finished decoration 

00:07:23.360 --> 00:07:26.450
 suggestion 

00:07:23.990 --> 00:07:27.830
 I hope it has something to do with you 

00:07:26.450 --> 00:07:29.810
 Of course, I am always happy about it 

00:07:27.830 --> 00:07:31.100
 a thumbs up and I'm happy 

00:07:29.810 --> 00:07:31.970
 even if you come back next time 

00:07:31.100 --> 00:07:34.750
 be there 

00:07:31.970 --> 00:07:34.750
 so then will 

00:07:54.289 --> 00:07:56.889
 com
