some from a friend we're going to take a
serrated<00:01:13.600> knife<00:01:13.930> and<00:01:14.229> I<00:01:15.160> would<00:01:15.460> say<00:01:15.580> probably

00:01:15.780 --> 00:01:15.790 
serrated knife and I would say probably

00:01:15.790 --> 00:01:17.880 
serrated knife and I would say probably
cut<00:01:16.119> it<00:01:16.210> into<00:01:16.390> fours<00:01:16.990> the<00:01:17.320> ice<00:01:17.440> cream<00:01:17.770> to

00:01:17.880 --> 00:01:17.890

sandwich ratio extreme or ice cream to

00:01:19.900 --> 00:01:21.960 
sandwich ratio extreme or ice cream to
sandwich<00:01:20.170> but<00:01:20.680> if<00:01:20.920> you<00:01:21.009> do<00:01:21.340> so<00:01:21.670> you<00:01:21.729> wanna<00:01:21.880> make

00:01:21.960 --> 00:01:21.970 
sandwich but if you do so you wanna make

00:01:21.970 --> 00:01:23.370 
sandwich but if you do so you wanna make
sure<00:01:22.090> you<00:01:22.210> cut<00:01:22.450> these<00:01:22.600> as<00:01:22.840> straight<00:01:23.229> as<00:01:23.350> you

00:01:23.370 --> 00:01:23.380 
sure you cut these as straight as you

00:01:23.380 --> 00:01:25.980 
sure you cut these as straight as you
possibly<00:01:23.800> can<00:01:23.979> kind<00:01:24.399> of<00:01:24.460> want<00:01:24.640> to<00:01:24.729> saw<00:01:25.210> it<00:01:25.750> and

00:01:25.980 --> 00:01:25.990 
possibly can kind of want to saw it and

00:01:25.990 --> 00:01:28.200 
possibly can kind of want to saw it and
I<00:01:26.290> let<00:01:26.470> my<00:01:26.590> ice<00:01:26.740> cream<00:01:26.950> thaw<00:01:27.250> for<00:01:27.670> a<00:01:27.729> little<00:01:28.090> bit

00:01:28.200 --> 00:01:28.210 
I let my ice cream thaw for a little bit

00:01:28.210 --> 00:01:32.060 
I let my ice cream thaw for a little bit
just<00:01:28.240> so<00:01:28.450> this<00:01:28.600> would<00:01:28.810> be<00:01:29.020> easier<00:01:29.590> because

00:01:32.060 --> 00:01:32.070 

00:01:32.070 --> 00:01:35.340 

while<00:01:33.070> thawing<00:01:33.399> them<00:01:33.640> was<00:01:33.820> a<00:01:33.850> great<00:01:34.270> idea<00:01:34.450> make

00:01:35.340 --> 00:01:35.350 
while thawing them was a great idea make

00:01:35.350 --> 00:01:37.080 
while thawing them was a great idea make
sure<00:01:35.590> you<00:01:35.800> don't<00:01:35.979> let<00:01:36.250> them<00:01:36.399> sell<00:01:36.700> for<00:01:36.729> too

00:01:37.080 --> 00:01:37.090 
sure you don't let them sell for too

00:01:37.090 --> 00:01:40.050 
sure you don't let them sell for too
long<00:01:37.330> because<00:01:37.810> ten<00:01:38.619> years<00:01:39.130> cutting<00:01:39.520> liquid

00:01:40.050 --> 00:01:40.060 
long because ten years cutting liquid

00:01:40.060 --> 00:01:42.889
