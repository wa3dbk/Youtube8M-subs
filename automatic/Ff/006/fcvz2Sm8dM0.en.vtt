00:00:04.390 --> 00:00:13.570
 about as a parent heidi basically this 

00:00:08.860 --> 00:00:17.240
 for newbies how to come level such as 

00:00:13.570 --> 00:00:20.119
 8 5 10 5 crack 

00:00:17.240 --> 00:00:20.950
 Well, in general, only on such for small 

00:00:20.119 --> 00:00:25.369
 levels 

00:00:20.950 --> 00:00:26.440
 it is difficult to break through this case 

00:00:25.369 --> 00:00:30.390
 me on 

00:00:26.440 --> 00:00:32.570
 my tank is worth an ear 

00:00:30.390 --> 00:00:37.090
 it happens 

00:00:32.570 --> 00:00:37.090
 damage 110 penetration 100 

00:00:38.470 --> 00:00:42.870
 Here for example I will show the most important 

00:00:43.329 --> 00:00:48.250
 when 

00:00:44.790 --> 00:00:52.200
 you this goes so tilted 

00:00:48.250 --> 00:00:52.200
 and experience quite difficult to break through 

00:00:52.570 --> 00:00:59.670
 but 

00:00:54.240 --> 00:01:03.930
 There is such a thing now here is this snowball 

00:00:59.670 --> 00:01:07.470
 here is the country we are breaking through here 

00:01:03.930 --> 00:01:09.780
 and here it does not always make its way but you can 

00:01:07.470 --> 00:01:11.030
 also punch the same way with the other 

00:01:09.780 --> 00:01:15.200
 parties 

00:01:11.030 --> 00:01:18.410
 here in this crack and education 

00:01:15.200 --> 00:01:22.920
 further many collect 100 

00:01:18.410 --> 00:01:24.750
 here and here right here will go 

00:01:22.920 --> 00:01:27.510
 years rebound or not struck 

00:01:24.750 --> 00:01:28.050
 here you will not break or there will be 

00:01:27.510 --> 00:01:32.820
 ricochet 

00:01:28.050 --> 00:01:37.110
 it's all a mess now block block 

00:01:32.820 --> 00:01:38.880
 take the stretch can break it 

00:01:37.110 --> 00:01:44.730
 commander 

00:01:38.880 --> 00:01:49.229
 but this weight is not always true what 

00:01:44.730 --> 00:01:54.810
 don't break through the second time here 

00:01:49.229 --> 00:02:00.600
 you can hit the uniform further 

00:01:54.810 --> 00:02:05.030
 punch right here we shoot and we can 

00:02:00.600 --> 00:02:08.640
 to shock him a driver 

00:02:05.030 --> 00:02:13.130
 here you can also punch him and shoot him 

00:02:08.640 --> 00:02:16.580
 and a map of winters and action mura 

00:02:13.130 --> 00:02:22.030
 I would like to say a few words 

00:02:16.580 --> 00:02:22.030
 he and the elephant he rides barton 

00:02:23.280 --> 00:02:29.430
 here he has an ammunition here 

00:02:29.870 --> 00:02:38.209
 the principle of marriage is difficult to break through 

00:02:33.430 --> 00:02:45.890
 rarely does it explode ammunition tanks 

00:02:38.209 --> 00:02:48.730
 it is here that is , I set it on fire 

00:02:45.890 --> 00:02:48.730
 often 

00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:55.760
 Well, in general, all
