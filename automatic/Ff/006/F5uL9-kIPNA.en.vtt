 miss is our well to all well the 

00:01:15.690 --> 00:01:21.720
 what we do here we are going to join 

00:01:19.460 --> 00:01:24.200
 to our potatoes 

00:01:21.720 --> 00:01:24.200
 the two yolks 

00:01:26.760 --> 00:01:35.530
 nutmeg struggles with people 

00:01:30.180 --> 00:01:37.710
 teaspoon nutmeg years and the 

00:01:35.530 --> 00:01:40.030
 cheese 

00:01:37.710 --> 00:01:47.590
 try not even need to look at everything 

00:01:40.030 --> 00:01:49.420
 a little consistency in shady well i 

00:01:47.590 --> 00:01:52.380
 ingredients and in the meantime I start 

00:01:49.420 --> 00:01:55.510
 prepare the eggs where we will see it 

00:01:52.380 --> 00:01:58.540
 emerge the croquettes we used to use a 

00:01:55.510 --> 00:02:04.050
 whole egg naturally does not stand 

00:01:58.540 --> 00:02:04.050
 risking polenta a bit of class 

00:02:06.480 --> 00:02:15.570
 banging in the meantime we have already put 

00:02:10.690 --> 00:02:15.570
 to warm the oil we can have a little 

00:02:17.010 --> 00:02:22.510
 here we are like the situation 

00:02:19.510 --> 00:02:25.060
 effort it was done something I show 

00:02:22.510 --> 00:02:26.880
 a perfect little bit slips a little less 

00:02:25.060 --> 00:02:29.940
 of grated cheese 

00:02:26.880 --> 00:02:32.890
 at this point all that remains is to take 

00:02:29.940 --> 00:02:38.190
 your dough and let's start taking that 

00:02:32.890 --> 00:02:38.190
 in its oils 30 degrees more or less 

00:02:38.290 --> 00:02:45.550
 and then I like making cylinders like that 

00:02:41.520 --> 00:02:47.380
 at no to I did I decide 

00:02:45.550 --> 00:02:52.709
 We prepare all and then after slowly 

00:02:47.380 --> 00:02:52.709
 we pay them we make fries 

00:02:53.010 --> 00:02:59.290
 nice I'm doing but the star and then 

00:02:57.610 --> 00:03:02.520
 I write say how he speaks and put it 

00:02:59.290 --> 00:03:02.520
 also oil 

00:03:04.920 --> 00:03:10.360
 here we are beautiful both quiet and 

00:03:08.590 --> 00:03:14.380
 let's do that last if you can tell 

00:03:10.360 --> 00:03:25.990
 that's the show you had three 

00:03:14.380 --> 00:03:29.470
 shows adult couples but then it's up to 

00:03:25.990 --> 00:03:31.600
 she and we are all curious 

00:03:29.470 --> 00:03:34.990
 I took them too but look at them 

00:03:31.600 --> 00:03:38.190
 what should happen here I was here I 

00:03:34.990 --> 00:03:38.190
 I wash my hands under the calegna 

00:03:51.890 --> 00:03:57.870
 pole show not in the wet that 

00:03:54.780 --> 00:03:58.849
 I did when we see what happens is 

00:03:57.870 --> 00:04:01.980
 the reform 

00:03:58.849 --> 00:04:03.769
 begins to cook them 2 again 

00:04:01.980 --> 00:04:09.030
 because then the oil is cooled 

00:04:03.769 --> 00:04:11.659
 the event was that I warm him if the 

00:04:09.030 --> 00:04:11.659
 go get the card 

00:04:18.280 --> 00:04:23.350
 I recommend a couple of minutes more 

00:04:29.560 --> 00:04:33.520
 love yourself calm calmly for a moment 

00:04:33.940 --> 00:04:49.820
 Please behold here the sea delay that 

00:04:48.320 --> 00:04:55.390
 wants advice as we are careful 

00:04:49.820 --> 00:04:55.390
 a female now mine 

00:04:55.900 --> 00:05:15.910
 here we go, let's take this point 

00:05:11.510 --> 00:05:15.910
 8 hopefully
