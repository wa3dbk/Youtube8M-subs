00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.760
 I'm interested in the excitement of this concert the appearance of and of the 

00:00:03.760 --> 00:00:07.940
 communication of what the pianist loves to communicate through 

00:00:07.940 --> 00:00:12.410
 the only thing the sound because not seeing it is not eh 

00:00:13.079 --> 00:00:14.400
 d 

00:00:14.400 --> 00:00:18.300
 here we like like when you are at home and we advise you to talk about the facts 

00:00:18.300 --> 00:00:23.400
 your constancy plant in the midst of other people but that in any case totally for 

00:00:23.400 --> 00:00:24.810
 strength concentrated on 

00:00:24.810 --> 00:00:27.810
 this is what you hear because you have no other reference points 

00:00:47.890 --> 00:00:49.100
 this dream 

00:00:49.100 --> 00:00:52.990
 in the dark it took shape and daewoo carbonara meetings 

00:00:53.760 --> 00:00:56.840
 by word of mouth they are 

00:00:56.840 --> 00:00:59.010
 in this collective madness 

00:00:59.010 --> 00:01:00.730
 and I wish it were 

00:01:00.730 --> 00:01:01.940
 madness 

00:01:01.940 --> 00:01:03.760
 that a collective experience 

00:01:03.760 --> 00:01:08.880
 being together with 1000 bad people that the strength of the energy of a core of 

00:01:08.880 --> 00:01:10.630
 thousand people 

00:01:10.630 --> 00:01:14.110
 it can even break through any barrier 

00:01:14.110 --> 00:01:19.159
 but it also happens that every single person of those of those thousand 

00:01:19.800 --> 00:01:22.810
 must have the desire for strength 

00:01:22.810 --> 00:01:24.840
 to go against 

00:01:24.840 --> 00:01:28.820
 their fears and this allows an immense act of generosity 

00:01:29.550 --> 00:01:32.690
 and I think the beauty of music still today 

00:01:32.690 --> 00:01:34.220
 is just this d 

00:01:34.220 --> 00:01:37.580
 i live the experience together collectively 

00:01:37.580 --> 00:01:39.090
 and to succeed in 

00:01:39.090 --> 00:01:42.090

 I had it in the extraordinary fetus because I was about to dive back 

00:02:09.399 --> 00:02:14.189
 the queen of the modern I would say almost hilary to grow some light 

00:02:15.819 --> 00:02:18.819
 2f collapses for piano 

00:02:20.389 --> 00:02:24.150
 it was an incredible feeling samara as it was how to succeed in 

00:02:25.439 --> 00:02:29.099
 how to review the world of the first time it seems almost after 30 minutes you don't 

00:02:29.099 --> 00:02:30.099

00:02:30.099 --> 00:02:31.889

00:02:57.879 --> 00:03:00.369
 beautiful disorientation 

00:03:00.369 --> 00:03:03.409
 I have from the dark theater of the sun around 

00:03:03.409 --> 00:03:04.679

00:03:07.959 --> 00:03:12.999
 almost connection between the sound the piano I really felt into 

00:03:12.999 --> 00:03:15.309
 positive sense was an emotion 

00:03:15.309 --> 00:03:18.379

 the fact of the time that seems to have flown away mmm according to me situation 

00:03:45.669 --> 00:03:49.589
 strange as if everything had lasted very little in an instant
