find amazing is that this little fella
here<00:00:17.699> is<00:00:18.920> charged<00:00:19.920> by<00:00:20.220> this<00:00:20.939> for<00:00:21.300> what<00:00:21.830> solar

00:00:22.820 --> 00:00:22.830 
here is charged by this for what solar

00:00:22.830 --> 00:00:28.429 
here is charged by this for what solar
panel<00:00:24.980> on<00:00:25.980> the<00:00:26.369> back<00:00:26.630> we've<00:00:27.630> got<00:00:27.960> various

panel on the back we've got various
different<00:00:28.529> this<00:00:29.519> button<00:00:29.820> here<00:00:30.029> pretty<00:00:30.779> much

00:00:30.890 --> 00:00:30.900 
different this button here pretty much

00:00:30.900 --> 00:00:32.720 
different this button here pretty much
changes<00:00:31.529> the<00:00:31.650> brightness<00:00:32.040> of<00:00:32.189> the<00:00:32.219> lamp<00:00:32.460> now<00:00:32.700> I

00:00:32.720 --> 00:00:32.730 
changes the brightness of the lamp now I

00:00:32.730 --> 00:00:36.530 
changes the brightness of the lamp now I
am<00:00:32.969> out<00:00:33.149> site<00:00:33.450> so<00:00:33.840> let's<00:00:34.079> see<00:00:34.500> so<00:00:35.210> just<00:00:36.210> do<00:00:36.360> that

00:00:36.530 --> 00:00:36.540 
am out site so let's see so just do that

00:00:36.540 --> 00:00:41.959 
am out site so let's see so just do that
so<00:00:36.780> we've<00:00:37.200> got<00:00:37.350> one<00:00:37.530> brightness<00:00:40.730> increase<00:00:41.730> it

00:00:41.959 --> 00:00:41.969 
so we've got one brightness increase it

00:00:41.969 --> 00:00:44.930 
so we've got one brightness increase it
and<00:00:42.480> increase<00:00:42.899> it<00:00:43.110> now<00:00:43.770> this<00:00:44.010> light<00:00:44.399> can<00:00:44.670> last

00:00:44.930 --> 00:00:44.940 
and increase it now this light can last

00:00:44.940 --> 00:00:46.549 
and increase it now this light can last
for<00:00:45.120> 36<00:00:45.899> hours

00:00:46.549 --> 00:00:46.559 
for 36 hours

00:00:46.559 --> 00:00:49.610 
for 36 hours
simply<00:00:47.250> charged<00:00:47.670> by<00:00:47.940> that<00:00:48.270> solar<00:00:48.570> panel<00:00:48.750> not

00:00:49.610 --> 00:00:49.620 
simply charged by that solar panel not

00:00:49.620 --> 00:00:52.310 
simply charged by that solar panel not
only<00:00:50.100> does<00:00:50.280> it<00:00:50.309> give<00:00:50.610> off<00:00:50.700> light<00:00:51.059> it<00:00:51.510> can<00:00:51.930> also

00:00:52.310 --> 00:00:52.320 
only does it give off light it can also

00:00:52.320 --> 00:01:01.970 
only does it give off light it can also
charge<00:00:53.100> a<00:00:53.399> phone<00:00:54.440> so<00:00:56.449> let's<00:00:57.449> just<00:00:57.780> do<00:00:58.109> this<00:01:00.980> I'm

00:01:24.810 --> 00:01:27.230 
ones as well the smaller ones don't have
as<00:01:24.990> many<00:01:25.140> USB<00:01:25.619> chargers<00:01:26.369> and<00:01:26.520> the<00:01:26.939> brilliant

00:01:27.230 --> 00:01:27.240 
as many USB chargers and the brilliant

00:01:27.240 --> 00:01:29.660 
as many USB chargers and the brilliant
thing<00:01:27.330> about<00:01:27.390> this<00:01:27.689> is<00:01:27.930> the<00:01:28.670> organization

00:01:29.660 --> 00:01:29.670 
thing about this is the organization

00:01:29.670 --> 00:01:32.630 
thing about this is the organization
called<00:01:29.909> solar<00:01:30.270> aid<00:01:30.600> are<00:01:31.130> using<00:01:32.130> this<00:01:32.340> in

00:01:32.630 --> 00:01:32.640 
called solar aid are using this in

00:01:32.640 --> 00:01:35.330 
called solar aid are using this in
countries<00:01:33.479> where<00:01:33.720> they're<00:01:34.049> normally<00:01:34.590> reliant

00:01:35.330 --> 00:01:35.340 
countries where they're normally reliant

00:01:35.340 --> 00:01:40.249 
countries where they're normally reliant
on<00:01:35.689> say<00:01:36.689> kerosene<00:01:37.430> lamps<00:01:38.430> to<00:01:38.759> to<00:01:39.540> light<00:01:39.750> up<00:01:39.990> and

00:01:40.249 --> 00:01:40.259 
on say kerosene lamps to to light up and

00:01:40.259 --> 00:01:43.310 
on say kerosene lamps to to light up and
so<00:01:41.009> simply<00:01:41.700> they<00:01:42.180> put<00:01:42.630> one<00:01:42.780> of<00:01:42.869> these<00:01:42.960> on<00:01:43.020> the

00:01:43.310 --> 00:01:43.320 
so simply they put one of these on the

00:01:43.320 --> 00:01:45.649 
so simply they put one of these on the
roof<00:01:43.530> there's<00:01:44.070> about<00:01:44.220> 5<00:01:44.520> meters<00:01:44.909> of<00:01:44.939> cable<00:01:45.299> and

00:01:45.649 --> 00:01:45.659 
roof there's about 5 meters of cable and

00:01:45.659 --> 00:01:49.280 
roof there's about 5 meters of cable and
then<00:01:46.110> they've<00:01:46.290> got<00:01:46.439> a<00:01:46.470> light<00:01:46.770> to<00:01:46.979> power<00:01:48.290> let's

00:01:49.280 --> 00:01:49.290 
then they've got a light to power let's

00:01:49.290 --> 00:01:51.020 
then they've got a light to power let's
say<00:01:49.470> for<00:01:49.649> a<00:01:49.680> week<00:01:49.860> so<00:01:50.490> I<00:01:50.520> think<00:01:50.610> this<00:01:50.759> is<00:01:50.939> an

00:01:51.020 --> 00:01:51.030 
say for a week so I think this is an

00:01:51.030 --> 00:01:54.050 
say for a week so I think this is an
awesome<00:01:51.540> idea<00:01:51.689> and<00:01:52.170> also<00:01:52.530> if<00:01:53.009> you<00:01:53.340> donate<00:01:53.759> 3

00:01:54.050 --> 00:01:54.060 
awesome idea and also if you donate 3

00:01:54.060 --> 00:01:55.670 
awesome idea and also if you donate 3
pounds<00:01:54.360> or<00:01:54.479> so<00:01:54.630> that<00:01:54.810> aid<00:01:54.960> they<00:01:55.350> will<00:01:55.500> actually

00:01:55.670 --> 00:01:55.680 
pounds or so that aid they will actually

00:01:55.680 --> 00:01:59.120 
pounds or so that aid they will actually
then<00:01:56.549> give<00:01:57.210> one<00:01:57.329> of<00:01:57.450> these<00:01:57.570> to<00:01:57.869> that<00:01:58.229> project

00:01:59.120 --> 00:01:59.130 
then give one of these to that project

00:01:59.130 --> 00:02:01.550 
then give one of these to that project
so<00:01:59.700> the<00:02:00.030> links<00:02:00.270> will<00:02:00.450> be<00:02:00.479> in<00:02:00.869> the<00:02:01.020> description

00:02:01.550 --> 00:02:01.560 
so the links will be in the description

00:02:01.560 --> 00:02:04.940 
so the links will be in the description
and<00:02:02.090> yeah<00:02:03.090> but<00:02:03.390> I<00:02:03.450> think<00:02:03.780> this<00:02:04.290> as<00:02:04.439> a<00:02:04.500> product

00:02:04.940 --> 00:02:04.950 
and yeah but I think this as a product

00:02:04.950 --> 00:02:07.520 
and yeah but I think this as a product
for<00:02:05.790> all<00:02:05.909> for<00:02:06.180> the<00:02:06.270> home<00:02:06.420> office<00:02:06.630> as<00:02:06.960> well<00:02:07.170> or

00:02:07.520 --> 00:02:07.530 
for all for the home office as well or

00:02:07.530 --> 00:02:09.859 
for all for the home office as well or
you<00:02:07.770> could<00:02:08.069> even<00:02:08.190> go<00:02:08.369> camping<00:02:08.610> so<00:02:09.149> this<00:02:09.509> thing

00:02:09.859 --> 00:02:09.869 
you could even go camping so this thing

00:02:09.869 --> 00:02:12.559 
you could even go camping so this thing
here<00:02:10.200> actually<00:02:10.530> comes<00:02:11.009> off<00:02:11.280> and<00:02:11.670> you<00:02:12.450> could

00:02:12.559 --> 00:02:12.569 
here actually comes off and you could

00:02:12.569 --> 00:02:13.550 
here actually comes off and you could
hook<00:02:12.750> it

00:02:13.550 --> 00:02:13.560 
hook it

00:02:13.560 --> 00:02:16.610 
hook it
for<00:02:13.800> example<00:02:14.280> on<00:02:14.819> to<00:02:15.209> a<00:02:15.240> tent<00:02:15.600> I<00:02:15.959> think<00:02:16.440> it's<00:02:16.530> a

00:02:16.610 --> 00:02:16.620 
for example on to a tent I think it's a

00:02:16.620 --> 00:02:19.280 
for example on to a tent I think it's a
really<00:02:17.100> versatile<00:02:17.760> solar<00:02:18.510> product<00:02:18.930> for<00:02:19.260> a

00:02:19.280 --> 00:02:19.290 
really versatile solar product for a
