00:00:09.230 --> 00:00:09.240

00:00:13.160 --> 00:00:13.170 
writing so I'm thinking we should have

00:00:13.170 --> 00:00:16.609 
writing so I'm thinking we should have
some<00:00:13.349> review<00:00:13.679> on<00:00:13.830> misplaced<00:00:14.250> modifiers<00:00:15.619> so

if<00:00:53.570> your<00:00:53.870> modifier<00:00:54.679> is<00:00:55.429> too<00:00:55.640> far<00:00:55.910> from<00:00:56.120> the

00:00:56.979 --> 00:00:56.989 
if your modifier is too far from the

your

00:01:10.819 --> 00:01:10.829 

00:01:10.829 --> 00:01:14.669 

take<00:01:11.829> this<00:01:12.070> sentence<00:01:12.490> for<00:01:12.670> example<00:01:13.679> covered

00:01:14.669 --> 00:01:14.679 
take this sentence for example covered

00:01:14.679 --> 00:01:18.240 
take this sentence for example covered
in<00:01:14.829> jelly<00:01:15.070> Sam<00:01:15.729> ate<00:01:15.969> his<00:01:16.179> toast<00:01:16.479> as<00:01:17.250> this

00:01:18.240 --> 00:01:18.250 
in jelly Sam ate his toast as this

00:01:18.250 --> 00:01:20.789 
in jelly Sam ate his toast as this
sentence<00:01:18.610> its<00:01:18.850> it<00:01:19.390> sounds<00:01:19.659> like<00:01:19.780> Sam<00:01:20.320> is<00:01:20.590> the

00:01:20.789 --> 00:01:20.799 
sentence its it sounds like Sam is the

00:01:20.799 --> 00:01:23.580 
sentence its it sounds like Sam is the
one<00:01:20.950> covered<00:01:21.189> in<00:01:21.429> jelly<00:01:21.810> well<00:01:22.810> we<00:01:23.200> know<00:01:23.319> that

00:01:23.580 --> 00:01:23.590 
one covered in jelly well we know that

00:01:23.590 --> 00:01:25.169 
one covered in jelly well we know that
is<00:01:23.710> not<00:01:23.740> the<00:01:23.890> case<00:01:24.159> because<00:01:24.579> that<00:01:24.819> would<00:01:25.060> be<00:01:25.149> a

00:01:25.169 --> 00:01:25.179 
is not the case because that would be a

00:01:25.179 --> 00:01:26.929 
is not the case because that would be a
huge<00:01:25.450> sticky<00:01:26.020> mess

00:01:26.929 --> 00:01:26.939 
huge sticky mess

00:01:26.939 --> 00:01:31.050 
huge sticky mess
so<00:01:27.939> why<00:01:28.270> is<00:01:28.329> there<00:01:28.689> this<00:01:28.899> ambiguity<00:01:29.670> well<00:01:30.670> it's

00:01:31.050 --> 00:01:31.060 
so why is there this ambiguity well it's

00:01:31.060 --> 00:01:33.660 
so why is there this ambiguity well it's
because<00:01:31.360> the<00:01:31.390> modifier<00:01:31.770> covered<00:01:32.770> in<00:01:32.860> jelly<00:01:33.100> is

00:01:33.660 --> 00:01:33.670 
because the modifier covered in jelly is

00:01:33.670 --> 00:01:36.749 
because the modifier covered in jelly is
misplaced<00:01:34.590> it<00:01:35.590> should<00:01:36.009> be<00:01:36.189> closer<00:01:36.459> to<00:01:36.610> the

00:01:36.749 --> 00:01:36.759 
misplaced it should be closer to the

00:01:36.759 --> 00:01:38.819 
misplaced it should be closer to the
thing<00:01:37.030> it<00:01:37.149> is<00:01:37.179> modifying<00:01:37.780> which<00:01:38.140> in<00:01:38.409> this<00:01:38.590> case

00:01:38.819 --> 00:01:38.829 
thing it is modifying which in this case

00:01:38.829 --> 00:01:42.210 
thing it is modifying which in this case
is<00:01:39.130> the<00:01:39.310> toast<00:01:39.520> in<00:01:40.590> order<00:01:41.590> to<00:01:41.679> fix<00:01:41.920> the

00:01:42.210 --> 00:01:42.220 
is the toast in order to fix the

00:01:42.220 --> 00:01:44.460 
is the toast in order to fix the
sentence<00:01:42.640> simply<00:01:43.329> move<00:01:43.720> the<00:01:43.840> modifier<00:01:44.259> to<00:01:44.439> the

00:01:44.460 --> 00:01:44.470 
sentence simply move the modifier to the

00:01:44.470 --> 00:01:46.260 
sentence simply move the modifier to the
end<00:01:44.679> of<00:01:44.829> the<00:01:44.920> sentence<00:01:45.250> and<00:01:45.700> add<00:01:46.030> a<00:01:46.060> few

00:01:46.260 --> 00:01:46.270 
end of the sentence and add a few

00:01:46.270 --> 00:01:48.630 
end of the sentence and add a few
connecting<00:01:46.689> words<00:01:47.069> that<00:01:48.069> gives<00:01:48.310> us<00:01:48.459> the

00:01:48.630 --> 00:01:48.640 
connecting words that gives us the

00:01:48.640 --> 00:01:51.240 
connecting words that gives us the
sentence<00:01:48.970> Sam<00:01:49.959> ate<00:01:50.200> his<00:01:50.380> toast<00:01:50.679> that<00:01:51.130> was

00:01:51.240 --> 00:01:51.250 
sentence Sam ate his toast that was

00:01:51.250 --> 00:01:53.999 
sentence Sam ate his toast that was
covered<00:01:51.579> in<00:01:51.670> jelly<00:01:52.079> now<00:01:53.079> that<00:01:53.380> makes<00:01:53.739> a<00:01:53.860> lot
