00:02:27.570 --> 00:02:27.580 
don't want to support the transaxle

00:02:27.580 --> 00:02:29.490 
don't want to support the transaxle
because<00:02:27.730> I<00:02:27.760> want<00:02:27.910> to<00:02:27.970> take<00:02:28.060> that<00:02:28.180> away<00:02:28.410> so<00:02:29.410> I'll

at<00:04:06.989> your<00:04:07.019> own<00:04:07.139> risk<00:04:07.290> I<00:04:07.769> have<00:04:07.799> to<00:04:08.100> say<00:04:08.519> that<00:04:08.790> so

00:04:09.259 --> 00:04:09.269 
at your own risk I have to say that so

00:04:09.269 --> 00:04:12.410 
at your own risk I have to say that so
what<00:04:09.420> I've<00:04:09.540> done<00:04:09.720> is<00:04:09.780> I've<00:04:10.200> taken<00:04:10.230> out<00:04:11.420> both

00:04:12.410 --> 00:04:12.420 
what I've done is I've taken out both

00:04:12.420 --> 00:04:14.000 
what I've done is I've taken out both
these<00:04:12.630> bolts<00:04:13.079> that<00:04:13.230> through<00:04:13.470> the<00:04:13.590> straight

00:04:14.000 --> 00:04:14.010 
these bolts that through the straight

00:04:14.010 --> 00:04:15.979 
these bolts that through the straight
through<00:04:14.190> bolts<00:04:14.549> to<00:04:14.760> the<00:04:14.790> the<00:04:15.420> support<00:04:15.810> the

00:04:15.979 --> 00:04:15.989 
through bolts to the the support the

00:04:15.989 --> 00:04:18.379 
through bolts to the the support the
crossmember<00:04:16.769> to<00:04:17.010> the<00:04:17.190> frame<00:04:17.579> and<00:04:17.849> then<00:04:18.269> what<00:04:18.359> I

00:04:18.379 --> 00:04:18.389 
crossmember to the frame and then what I

00:04:18.389 --> 00:04:20.420 
crossmember to the frame and then what I
did<00:04:18.630> you<00:04:18.720> can<00:04:18.840> see<00:04:18.959> that<00:04:19.109> wood<00:04:19.380> up<00:04:19.530> there

00:04:20.420 --> 00:04:20.430 
did you can see that wood up there

00:04:20.430 --> 00:04:23.330 
did you can see that wood up there
I<00:04:20.459> also<00:04:21.180> took<00:04:21.450> out<00:04:21.750> the<00:04:21.989> bolts<00:04:22.440> in<00:04:22.620> the<00:04:23.099> back

00:04:23.330 --> 00:04:23.340 
I also took out the bolts in the back

00:04:23.340 --> 00:04:28.409 
I also took out the bolts in the back
there<00:04:23.729> are<00:04:23.760> three<00:04:24.270> of<00:04:24.389> them<00:04:24.539> one<00:04:24.870> two<00:04:25.380> three

00:04:28.409 --> 00:04:28.419 

00:04:28.419 --> 00:04:31.309 

you<00:04:28.659> know<00:04:28.719> there's<00:04:29.020> a<00:04:29.080> nut<00:04:29.409> and<00:04:29.740> two<00:04:30.039> bolts<00:04:30.280> and

00:04:31.309 --> 00:04:31.319 
you know there's a nut and two bolts and

00:04:31.319 --> 00:04:34.439 
you know there's a nut and two bolts and
so<00:04:32.319> that<00:04:32.439> this<00:04:32.560> crossmember<00:04:32.830> can<00:04:33.310> swing<00:04:33.759> so

00:04:34.439 --> 00:04:34.449 
so that this crossmember can swing so

00:04:34.449 --> 00:04:38.909 
so that this crossmember can swing so
what<00:04:34.569> I<00:04:34.599> did<00:04:34.689> is<00:04:35.020> I<00:04:35.169> swung<00:04:35.620> it<00:04:36.210> from<00:04:37.210> here<00:04:37.919> over

00:04:38.909 --> 00:04:38.919 
what I did is I swung it from here over

00:04:38.919 --> 00:04:39.869 
what I did is I swung it from here over
okay

00:04:39.869 --> 00:04:39.879 
okay

00:04:39.879 --> 00:04:42.540 
okay
and<00:04:40.000> then<00:04:40.330> what<00:04:40.479> I<00:04:40.509> did<00:04:40.629> is<00:04:40.840> I<00:04:41.080> cut<00:04:41.620> some<00:04:42.370> wood

00:04:42.540 --> 00:04:42.550 
and then what I did is I cut some wood

00:04:42.550 --> 00:04:45.510 
and then what I did is I cut some wood
some<00:04:42.849> two<00:04:43.000> by<00:04:43.120> fours<00:04:43.360> and<00:04:44.229> I<00:04:44.889> placed<00:04:45.280> it

00:04:45.510 --> 00:04:45.520 
some two by fours and I placed it

00:04:45.520 --> 00:04:47.730 
some two by fours and I placed it
between<00:04:45.669> the<00:04:46.060> cross<00:04:46.090> member<00:04:46.659> and<00:04:46.689> the<00:04:47.050> engine

00:04:47.730 --> 00:04:47.740 
between the cross member and the engine

00:04:47.740 --> 00:04:50.429 
between the cross member and the engine
up<00:04:47.949> there<00:04:48.219> and<00:04:48.460> then<00:04:48.909> the<00:04:49.569> idea<00:04:49.900> is<00:04:49.960> that<00:04:50.259> when

00:04:50.429 --> 00:04:50.439 
up there and then the idea is that when

00:04:50.439 --> 00:04:54.240 
up there and then the idea is that when
I<00:04:50.500> dis<00:04:51.330> when<00:04:52.330> I<00:04:52.360> unbolt<00:04:52.840> the<00:04:53.050> transaxle<00:04:53.979> from

00:04:54.240 --> 00:04:54.250 
I dis when I unbolt the transaxle from

00:04:54.250 --> 00:04:55.980 
I dis when I unbolt the transaxle from
the<00:04:54.370> engine<00:04:54.729> that<00:04:55.270> the<00:04:55.419> engine<00:04:55.689> is<00:04:55.750> going<00:04:55.870> to

00:04:55.980 --> 00:04:55.990 
the engine that the engine is going to

00:04:55.990 --> 00:04:58.350 
the engine that the engine is going to
be<00:04:56.050> supported<00:04:56.469> on<00:04:56.530> that<00:04:56.740> the<00:04:57.699> rear<00:04:57.969> mounting

00:04:58.350 --> 00:04:58.360 
be supported on that the rear mounting

00:04:58.360 --> 00:05:00.149 
be supported on that the rear mounting
bracket<00:04:58.750> was<00:04:58.930> hard<00:04:59.349> to<00:04:59.469> get<00:04:59.560> off<00:04:59.680> it's<00:04:59.919> quite

00:05:00.149 --> 00:05:00.159 
bracket was hard to get off it's quite

00:05:00.159 --> 00:05:03.779 
bracket was hard to get off it's quite
embedded<00:05:00.729> in<00:05:00.819> the<00:05:01.020> engine<00:05:02.020> block<00:05:02.139> so<00:05:02.500> you<00:05:02.789> can

00:05:03.779 --> 00:05:03.789 
embedded in the engine block so you can

00:05:03.789 --> 00:05:05.459 
embedded in the engine block so you can
see<00:05:03.939> I've<00:05:04.029> got<00:05:04.150> a<00:05:04.210> long<00:05:04.539> extension<00:05:05.050> to

00:05:05.459 --> 00:05:05.469 
see I've got a long extension to

00:05:05.469 --> 00:05:08.279 
see I've got a long extension to
extensions<00:05:06.069> and<00:05:06.279> they<00:05:06.699> this<00:05:07.150> is<00:05:07.330> a<00:05:07.360> seventeen

00:05:08.279 --> 00:05:08.289 
extensions and they this is a seventeen

00:05:08.289 --> 00:05:12.360 
extensions and they this is a seventeen
mil<00:05:08.770> socket<00:05:09.449> so<00:05:10.449> there<00:05:10.719> is<00:05:10.960> you<00:05:11.710> look<00:05:12.039> at<00:05:12.159> this

00:05:12.360 --> 00:05:12.370 
mil socket so there is you look at this

00:05:12.370 --> 00:05:19.559 
mil socket so there is you look at this
thing<00:05:15.270> right<00:05:16.800> there<00:05:17.800> that<00:05:18.340> bowl<00:05:18.909> that<00:05:19.210> is<00:05:19.270> the

00:05:37.040 --> 00:05:37.050 
engine mount is is here the manual says

00:05:37.050 --> 00:05:43.100 
engine mount is is here the manual says
to<00:05:37.080> undo<00:05:37.470> all<00:05:37.590> kinds<00:05:37.889> of<00:05:37.979> bolts<00:05:38.310> I<00:05:41.750> suppose

00:05:43.100 --> 00:05:43.110 
to undo all kinds of bolts I suppose

00:05:43.110 --> 00:05:45.740 
to undo all kinds of bolts I suppose
out<00:05:43.770> of<00:05:44.040> it<00:05:44.160> was<00:05:44.490> right<00:05:44.820> in<00:05:44.970> here<00:05:45.240> you<00:05:45.389> can<00:05:45.540> see

out of it was right in here you can see

00:05:45.750 --> 00:05:47.689 
out of it was right in here you can see
these<00:05:45.930> Elena<00:05:46.350> just<00:05:46.470> just<00:05:46.800> take<00:05:46.949> it<00:05:47.100> out<00:05:47.220> one

00:05:47.689 --> 00:05:47.699 
these Elena just just take it out one

00:05:47.699 --> 00:05:49.340 
these Elena just just take it out one
thing<00:05:47.850> I<00:05:47.940> found<00:05:48.150> was<00:05:48.479> that<00:05:48.510> was<00:05:48.810> problem<00:05:49.199> was

00:05:49.340 --> 00:05:49.350 
thing I found was that was problem was

00:05:49.350 --> 00:05:52.640 
thing I found was that was problem was
the<00:05:49.470> battery<00:05:49.710> the<00:05:50.580> battery<00:05:50.870> bracket<00:05:51.870> this

00:05:52.640 --> 00:05:52.650 
the battery the battery bracket this

00:05:52.650 --> 00:05:54.890 
the battery the battery bracket this
that's<00:05:53.610> the<00:05:53.790> battery<00:05:53.970> bracket<00:05:54.540> right<00:05:54.660> there<00:05:54.870> I

00:05:54.890 --> 00:05:54.900 
that's the battery bracket right there I

00:05:54.900 --> 00:05:58.280 
that's the battery bracket right there I
had<00:05:55.110> to<00:05:55.139> unbolt<00:05:56.070> that<00:05:56.400> because<00:05:56.850> the<00:05:57.150> the<00:05:57.570> head

00:05:58.280 --> 00:05:58.290 
had to unbolt that because the the head

00:05:58.290 --> 00:06:00.590 
had to unbolt that because the the head
of<00:05:58.560> the<00:05:58.919> straight-through<00:05:59.490> bolt<00:05:59.729> kept

00:06:00.590 --> 00:06:00.600 
of the straight-through bolt kept

00:06:00.600 --> 00:06:02.750 
of the straight-through bolt kept
hitting<00:06:01.020> right<00:06:01.229> there<00:06:01.440> so<00:06:01.650> I<00:06:01.710> took<00:06:01.979> that<00:06:02.520> whole

00:06:02.750 --> 00:06:02.760 
hitting right there so I took that whole

00:06:02.760 --> 00:06:04.909 
hitting right there so I took that whole
bracket<00:06:03.540> off<00:06:03.840> and<00:06:04.139> then<00:06:04.260> got<00:06:04.440> the<00:06:04.590> bolt<00:06:04.770> out

00:06:04.909 --> 00:06:04.919 
bracket off and then got the bolt out

00:06:04.919 --> 00:06:07.580 
bracket off and then got the bolt out
now<00:06:05.669> definitely<00:06:06.150> take<00:06:06.660> off<00:06:06.870> the<00:06:07.139> entire

00:06:07.580 --> 00:06:07.590 
now definitely take off the entire

00:06:07.590 --> 00:06:10.430 
now definitely take off the entire
engine<00:06:07.919> mount<00:06:08.460> because<00:06:09.450> it's<00:06:09.840> connected<00:06:10.350> at

00:06:10.430 --> 00:06:10.440 
engine mount because it's connected at

00:06:10.440 --> 00:06:12.170 
engine mount because it's connected at
the<00:06:10.560> transaxle<00:06:11.280> a<00:06:11.430> couple<00:06:11.700> of<00:06:11.760> different<00:06:12.030> ways

00:06:12.170 --> 00:06:12.180 
the transaxle a couple of different ways

00:06:12.180 --> 00:06:14.210 
the transaxle a couple of different ways
and<00:06:12.540> it<00:06:12.870> gets<00:06:13.169> in<00:06:13.350> the<00:06:13.440> way<00:06:13.470> when<00:06:13.860> you<00:06:13.950> try<00:06:14.160> to

00:06:14.210 --> 00:06:14.220 
and it gets in the way when you try to

00:06:14.220 --> 00:06:15.860 
and it gets in the way when you try to
drop<00:06:14.460> the<00:06:14.639> transaxle<00:06:15.270> I've<00:06:15.330> just<00:06:15.479> been<00:06:15.600> trying

00:06:15.860 --> 00:06:15.870 
drop the transaxle I've just been trying

00:06:15.870 --> 00:06:18.110 
drop the transaxle I've just been trying

to do that now found that out one other
little<00:06:18.510> housekeeping<00:06:19.320> point<00:06:19.830> over<00:06:20.100> here<00:06:20.300> this

00:06:21.290 --> 00:06:21.300 
little housekeeping point over here this

00:06:21.300 --> 00:06:27.590 
little housekeeping point over here this
is<00:06:21.539> the<00:06:22.580> the<00:06:23.780> power<00:06:24.780> to<00:06:25.530> the<00:06:26.240> solenoid<00:06:27.240> it

00:06:27.590 --> 00:06:27.600 
is the the power to the solenoid it

00:06:27.600 --> 00:06:30.920 
is the the power to the solenoid it
slips<00:06:28.229> through<00:06:29.539> here<00:06:30.539> I'm<00:06:30.630> just<00:06:30.720> going<00:06:30.870> to

00:06:30.920 --> 00:06:30.930 
slips through here I'm just going to

00:06:30.930 --> 00:06:32.320 
slips through here I'm just going to
make<00:06:31.020> a<00:06:31.080> note<00:06:31.350> through<00:06:31.680> this<00:06:31.830> little<00:06:32.100> gap

00:06:32.320 --> 00:06:32.330 
make a note through this little gap

00:06:32.330 --> 00:06:37.050 
make a note through this little gap
underneath<00:06:33.330> the<00:06:33.510> plastic<00:06:34.520> cover

00:06:37.050 --> 00:06:37.060 
underneath the plastic cover

00:06:37.060 --> 00:06:40.559 
underneath the plastic cover
the<00:06:37.599> intake<00:06:38.020> manifold<00:06:38.410> so<00:06:38.919> just<00:06:39.280> I<00:06:39.580> hate<00:06:40.030> a<00:06:40.060> pop

00:06:40.559 --> 00:06:40.569 
the intake manifold so just I hate a pop

00:06:40.569 --> 00:06:42.990 
the intake manifold so just I hate a pop
pull<00:06:40.810> it<00:06:40.930> out<00:06:41.080> because<00:06:41.460> it'll<00:06:42.460> it'll<00:06:42.759> break

00:06:42.990 --> 00:06:43.000 
pull it out because it'll it'll break

00:06:43.000 --> 00:06:44.670 
pull it out because it'll it'll break
off<00:06:43.210> when<00:06:43.389> I<00:06:43.449> drop<00:06:43.660> the<00:06:43.780> training<00:06:44.139> and<00:06:44.289> then

00:06:44.670 --> 00:06:44.680 
off when I drop the training and then

00:06:44.680 --> 00:06:46.740 
off when I drop the training and then
you<00:06:44.770> can<00:06:44.889> see<00:06:45.099> now<00:06:45.310> that<00:06:45.639> transaxle<00:06:46.630> is

00:06:46.740 --> 00:06:46.750 
you can see now that transaxle is

00:06:46.750 --> 00:06:50.970 
you can see now that transaxle is
basically<00:06:47.259> pumped<00:06:47.710> off<00:06:47.830> and<00:06:48.550> it's<00:06:48.759> ringing
