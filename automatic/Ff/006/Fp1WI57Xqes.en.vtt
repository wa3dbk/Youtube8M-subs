00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.240
 Good friends and friends, and I'm going to do it today. 

00:00:03.929 --> 00:00:10.889
 a few arabesque works 

00:00:06.240 --> 00:00:16.350
 chocolate white chocolate 

00:00:10.889 --> 00:00:21.150
 Dark fifa then using those 

00:00:16.350 --> 00:00:26.760
 papers that on slow rice paper then 

00:00:21.150 --> 00:00:30.810
 I always keep this part that he is 

00:00:26.760 --> 00:00:33.000
 fairly firm and can see that I do not 

00:00:30.810 --> 00:00:37.020
 I took out the plastic to give me a 

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:38.399
 ease after removing the chocolate 

00:00:37.020 --> 00:00:41.309
 that yes 

00:00:38.399 --> 00:00:46.920
 and these works here are to adorn 

00:00:41.309 --> 00:00:48.660
 chocolate cake and enjoyed some cakes 

00:00:46.920 --> 00:00:50.489
 decide that he had a job of 

00:00:48.660 --> 00:00:53.039
 chocolate so today I'll be going 

00:00:50.489 --> 00:00:56.160
 How do you do? 

00:00:53.039 --> 00:00:58.739
 so here 's ours then like I said 

00:00:56.160 --> 00:01:02.809
 I have fractional coverage. 

00:00:58.739 --> 00:01:02.809
 white and black 

00:01:05.750 --> 00:01:17.479
 so here I am going to come with a small 

00:01:08.820 --> 00:01:17.479
 serving of white chocolate 6 squeeze 

00:01:27.729 --> 00:01:32.350
 Now you come with black 

00:01:56.720 --> 00:02:02.360
 So what am I going to do with this? 

00:01:58.590 --> 00:02:05.360
 chocolate I'll make them run 

00:02:02.360 --> 00:02:05.360
 below 

00:02:15.590 --> 00:02:23.900
 and now I go for it a support for 

00:02:21.620 --> 00:02:26.680
 You see how it looks 

00:02:23.900 --> 00:02:29.360
 here I put it inside a form 

00:02:26.680 --> 00:02:31.640
 It was difficult for him to look good on the side. 

00:02:29.360 --> 00:02:34.910
 if you want it to be more 

00:02:31.640 --> 00:02:38.390
 Corrugated has not only you but close 

00:02:34.910 --> 00:02:43.120
 I left here a little open to him 

00:02:38.390 --> 00:02:43.120
 it only left me slightly bent 

00:02:48.160 --> 00:02:55.010
 in this other one here I've scratched with the 

00:02:51.200 --> 00:02:58.069
 pen is but you can do it by hand 

00:02:55.010 --> 00:02:59.690
 free I scratched to ease where I go 

00:02:58.069 --> 00:03:01.640
 go with the risks 

00:02:59.690 --> 00:03:06.260
 so I listened on one side only that I 

00:03:01.640 --> 00:03:08.150
 I will turn to the pen she does not 

00:03:06.260 --> 00:03:11.599
 come and spend in our chocolate then 

00:03:08.150 --> 00:03:13.870
 I'm going to do some work here too. 

00:03:11.599 --> 00:03:17.900
 with chocolate 

00:03:13.870 --> 00:03:20.620
 using as I told you a 

00:03:17.900 --> 00:03:20.620
 fractionated chocolate 

00:03:28.420 --> 00:03:35.260
 and then just wait to dry for 

00:03:31.370 --> 00:03:35.260
 using it in the cakes 

00:03:39.740 --> 00:03:47.440
 because if you scratch yourself you will have 

00:03:41.960 --> 00:03:47.440
 a better view of how to work it 

00:03:57.640 --> 00:04:04.590
 here if you want to do more 

00:04:00.610 --> 00:04:04.590
 stay the victory of each one 

00:04:53.729 --> 00:04:58.960
 I'm going to get a knife here or 

00:04:57.159 --> 00:05:05.219
 a toothpick so what am I going to do? 

00:04:58.960 --> 00:05:05.219
 I'm going to pull for me to make a drop. 

00:05:10.289 --> 00:05:16.919
 but it has a lot of chocolate work that 

00:05:13.240 --> 00:05:28.149
 You can do it by dressing the cakes. 

00:05:16.919 --> 00:05:30.490
 is very beautiful with these here where 

00:05:28.149 --> 00:05:34.990
 space things you can see and 

00:05:30.490 --> 00:05:38.639
 filling with white or can leave 

00:05:34.990 --> 00:05:38.639
 he also leaked 

00:05:51.930 --> 00:06:01.500
 the kitty would sit and paste a 

00:05:55.600 --> 00:06:01.500
 chocolate and dark 

00:06:02.350 --> 00:06:09.400
 so you may be doing too 

00:06:04.770 --> 00:06:16.260
 heart may leave it leaking or it may 

00:06:09.400 --> 00:06:20.620
 fill it can also do type 

00:06:16.260 --> 00:06:25.330
 both with white and 

00:06:20.620 --> 00:06:28.530
 dark and to make the grid is 

00:06:25.330 --> 00:06:28.530
 only this here 

00:06:40.730 --> 00:06:45.230
 only to do the serious 

00:06:46.020 --> 00:06:51.770
 It's a friend, I hope you have 

00:06:47.640 --> 00:06:51.770
 liked and until the next video
