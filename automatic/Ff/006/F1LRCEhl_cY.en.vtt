00:02:54.640 --> 00:02:54.650 
want to lower the key by half a step and

00:02:54.650 --> 00:02:57.460 
want to lower the key by half a step and
so<00:02:55.340> they<00:02:55.490> want<00:02:55.760> to<00:02:55.850> drop<00:02:56.150> it<00:02:56.420> down<00:02:56.450> and<00:02:57.020> sing

this in a key of F sharp well in a

00:03:01.010 --> 00:03:02.590 
this in a key of F sharp well in a
traditional<00:03:01.160> system<00:03:01.940> you'd<00:03:02.180> have<00:03:02.300> to<00:03:02.450> get<00:03:02.540> a

00:03:02.590 --> 00:03:02.600 
traditional system you'd have to get a

00:03:02.600 --> 00:03:06.100 
traditional system you'd have to get a
whole<00:03:02.930> new<00:03:03.200> chart<00:03:03.970> rekey<00:03:04.970> it<00:03:05.150> rewrite<00:03:05.750> out<00:03:05.930> all

00:03:16.120 --> 00:03:16.130 
number system all you do is go and

00:03:16.130 --> 00:03:18.580 
number system all you do is go and
figure<00:03:16.340> out<00:03:16.370> where<00:03:16.640> F<00:03:16.760> sharp<00:03:17.090> is<00:03:17.300> well<00:03:18.200> F<00:03:18.320> sharp

figure out where F sharp is well F sharp
is<00:03:18.710> right<00:03:18.860> here<00:03:19.100> and<00:03:19.220> then<00:03:20.090> you<00:03:20.330> just<00:03:20.660> place

00:03:21.400 --> 00:03:21.410 
is right here and then you just place

00:03:21.410 --> 00:03:26.020 
is right here and then you just place
your<00:03:21.650> 1<00:03:22.010> and<00:03:23.650> these<00:03:24.650> chords<00:03:25.130> don't<00:03:25.400> change<00:03:25.730> so

00:03:26.020 --> 00:03:26.030 
your 1 and these chords don't change so

00:03:26.030 --> 00:03:32.890 
your 1 and these chords don't change so
there's<00:03:26.210> a<00:03:26.300> first<00:03:26.540> note<00:03:28.900> second<00:03:30.700> six<00:03:31.900> third

chord there and four right there that

00:03:37.430 --> 00:03:41.700 
chord there and four right there that

neighboring but what if let's say you

00:04:38.560 --> 00:04:44.330 
neighboring but what if let's say you
have<00:04:39.930> someone<00:04:40.930> who<00:04:41.500> wants<00:04:41.710> to<00:04:41.919> sing<00:04:42.639> this<00:04:42.850> in<00:04:43.120> a

have someone who wants to sing this in a
different<00:04:45.340> key<00:04:45.520> even<00:04:45.730> more<00:04:46.830> let's<00:04:47.830> say<00:04:47.950> they

00:04:48.060 --> 00:04:48.070 
different key even more let's say they

00:04:48.070 --> 00:04:52.620 
different key even more let's say they
want<00:04:48.250> to<00:04:48.370> sing<00:04:48.639> this<00:04:48.850> in<00:04:49.380> B<00:04:50.380> in<00:04:50.800> a<00:04:51.790> key<00:04:51.970> of<00:04:52.090> B<00:04:52.360> I

00:04:52.620 --> 00:04:52.630 
want to sing this in B in a key of B I

00:04:52.630 --> 00:04:55.200 
want to sing this in B in a key of B I
think<00:04:53.560> the<00:04:53.680> song<00:04:53.919> might<00:04:54.190> be<00:04:54.400> in<00:04:54.550> a<00:04:54.639> key<00:04:54.820> of<00:04:54.850> B

00:04:55.200 --> 00:04:55.210 
think the song might be in a key of B

00:04:55.210 --> 00:04:58.260 
think the song might be in a key of B
but<00:04:56.080> all<00:04:56.260> you<00:04:56.470> need<00:04:56.620> to<00:04:56.710> do<00:04:56.919> this<00:04:57.820> never

00:04:58.260 --> 00:04:58.270 
but all you need to do this never

but all you need to do this never
changes<00:04:58.419> see<00:04:59.110> that's<00:04:59.290> the<00:04:59.440> thing<00:04:59.470> is<00:05:00.010> once<00:05:00.700> you

00:05:00.810 --> 00:05:00.820 
changes see that's the thing is once you

00:05:00.820 --> 00:05:02.400 
changes see that's the thing is once you
start<00:05:00.940> playing<00:05:01.480> using<00:05:01.840> the<00:05:02.020> number<00:05:02.260> system

00:05:02.400 --> 00:05:02.410 
start playing using the number system

00:05:02.410 --> 00:05:05.010 
start playing using the number system
you'll<00:05:02.860> start<00:05:03.520> understanding<00:05:03.820> music<00:05:04.660> theory

00:05:05.010 --> 00:05:05.020 
you'll start understanding music theory

00:05:05.020 --> 00:05:06.480 
you'll start understanding music theory
and<00:05:05.140> how<00:05:05.200> progressions<00:05:05.800> work<00:05:06.070> because<00:05:06.370> you

00:05:06.480 --> 00:05:06.490 
and how progressions work because you

00:05:06.490 --> 00:05:08.310 
and how progressions work because you
can<00:05:06.640> see<00:05:07.419> it<00:05:07.540> right<00:05:07.720> in<00:05:07.750> front<00:05:07.990> of<00:05:08.050> your<00:05:08.169> eyes

00:05:08.320 --> 00:05:14.010 
can see it right in front of your eyes
the<00:05:09.280> progression<00:05:10.090> is<00:05:10.710> the<00:05:11.710> same<00:05:12.070> those<00:05:13.020> chord

00:05:14.010 --> 00:05:14.020 
the progression is the same those chord

00:05:14.020 --> 00:05:16.830 
the progression is the same those chord
names<00:05:14.320> change<00:05:14.950> depending<00:05:15.610> on<00:05:15.730> the<00:05:15.880> key<00:05:16.150> but<00:05:16.750> if

00:05:16.830 --> 00:05:16.840 
names change depending on the key but if

00:05:16.840 --> 00:05:19.530 
names change depending on the key but if
you're<00:05:16.990> only<00:05:17.140> thinking<00:05:17.410> of<00:05:17.890> them<00:05:18.220> in<00:05:18.430> one<00:05:19.270> key

00:05:19.530 --> 00:05:19.540 
you're only thinking of them in one key

00:05:19.540 --> 00:05:22.380 
you're only thinking of them in one key
the<00:05:19.780> number<00:05:20.140> system<00:05:20.350> key<00:05:20.850> relative<00:05:21.850> to<00:05:22.060> number

00:05:22.380 --> 00:05:22.390 
the number system key relative to number

00:05:22.390 --> 00:05:25.560 
the number system key relative to number
one<00:05:22.690> they<00:05:23.530> will<00:05:23.740> never<00:05:23.950> change<00:05:24.280> so<00:05:24.580> playing

00:05:25.560 --> 00:05:25.570 
one they will never change so playing

00:05:25.570 --> 00:05:28.080 
one they will never change so playing
the<00:05:25.660> key<00:05:25.840> of<00:05:25.960> B<00:05:25.990> no<00:05:26.590> problem<00:05:27.280> let<00:05:27.460> me<00:05:27.550> find<00:05:27.760> a<00:05:27.850> B

00:05:28.080 --> 00:05:28.090 
the key of B no problem let me find a B

00:05:28.090 --> 00:05:32.580 
the key of B no problem let me find a B
there's<00:05:28.840> one<00:05:29.110> here<00:05:29.560> there's<00:05:29.740> a<00:05:30.040> B<00:05:30.310> here<00:05:31.590> you

00:05:32.580 --> 00:05:32.590 
there's one here there's a B here you

00:05:32.590 --> 00:05:33.870 
there's one here there's a B here you
know<00:05:32.680> what<00:05:32.800> I'm<00:05:32.890> going<00:05:33.010> to<00:05:33.070> do<00:05:33.190> let's<00:05:33.460> go<00:05:33.700> down

00:05:33.870 --> 00:05:33.880 
know what I'm going to do let's go down

00:05:33.880 --> 00:05:42.680 
know what I'm going to do let's go down
here<00:05:37.440> B<00:05:38.440> is<00:05:38.590> there<00:05:38.860> one<00:05:40.470> five<00:05:41.470> and<00:05:41.860> let's<00:05:42.310> say

00:05:42.680 --> 00:05:42.690 
here B is there one five and let's say

00:05:42.690 --> 00:05:46.080 
here B is there one five and let's say
you<00:05:43.690> don't<00:05:43.870> want<00:05:44.020> to<00:05:44.110> play<00:05:44.260> this<00:05:44.440> high<00:05:44.620> five<00:05:45.090> up

00:05:46.080 --> 00:05:46.090 
you don't want to play this high five up

00:05:46.090 --> 00:05:48.980 
you don't want to play this high five up
here<00:05:46.479> but<00:05:47.260> you<00:05:47.440> know<00:05:47.650> using<00:05:47.890> the<00:05:48.130> octaves<00:05:48.700> and

00:05:48.980 --> 00:05:48.990 
here but you know using the octaves and

00:05:48.990 --> 00:05:51.900 
here but you know using the octaves and
through<00:05:49.990> your<00:05:50.500> other<00:05:50.770> knowledge<00:05:51.160> of<00:05:51.700> where

00:05:51.900 --> 00:05:51.910 
through your other knowledge of where

00:05:51.910 --> 00:05:54.870 
through your other knowledge of where
other<00:05:52.150> numbers<00:05:52.690> are<00:05:52.930> well<00:05:53.770> five<00:05:54.490> is<00:05:54.700> right

00:05:54.870 --> 00:05:54.880 
other numbers are well five is right

00:05:54.880 --> 00:05:57.090 
other numbers are well five is right
here<00:05:55.180> you<00:05:55.330> can<00:05:55.990> play<00:05:56.140> that<00:05:56.289> lower<00:05:56.530> five<00:05:56.890> which

00:05:57.090 --> 00:05:57.100 
here you can play that lower five which

00:05:57.100 --> 00:06:02.040 
here you can play that lower five which
I<00:05:57.250> think<00:05:57.490> sounds<00:05:57.700> better<00:05:58.500> let's<00:05:59.500> say<00:06:00.840> you<00:06:01.840> want

00:06:02.040 --> 00:06:02.050 
I think sounds better let's say you want

00:06:02.050 --> 00:06:05.820 
I think sounds better let's say you want
the<00:06:02.200> six<00:06:02.970> well<00:06:03.970> yeah<00:06:04.810> the<00:06:04.990> six<00:06:05.320> you<00:06:05.470> would<00:06:05.620> kind

00:06:05.820 --> 00:06:05.830 
the six well yeah the six you would kind

00:06:05.830 --> 00:06:10.110 
the six well yeah the six you would kind
of<00:06:05.919> have<00:06:06.039> to<00:06:06.190> play<00:06:07.560> well<00:06:08.789> no<00:06:09.789> you<00:06:09.880> could

00:06:10.110 --> 00:06:10.120 
of have to play well no you could

00:06:10.120 --> 00:06:14.770 
of have to play well no you could
actually<00:06:10.270> play<00:06:10.690> the<00:06:10.870> six<00:06:11.140> over<00:06:11.620> here

00:06:14.770 --> 00:06:14.780 

00:06:14.780 --> 00:06:19.150 

and<00:06:15.250> then<00:06:16.250> the<00:06:16.370> for<00:06:16.760> you<00:06:17.630> can<00:06:17.870> play<00:06:18.200> instead<00:06:19.040> of

00:06:19.150 --> 00:06:19.160 
and then the for you can play instead of

00:06:19.160 --> 00:06:22.540 
and then the for you can play instead of
this<00:06:19.250> for<00:06:19.610> here<00:06:20.000> you<00:06:20.900> can<00:06:21.140> play<00:06:21.470> an<00:06:21.800> octave<00:06:22.130> of

00:06:22.540 --> 00:06:22.550 
this for here you can play an octave of

00:06:22.550 --> 00:06:26.410 
this for here you can play an octave of
that<00:06:22.730> which<00:06:23.120> would<00:06:23.360> be<00:06:23.660> this<00:06:24.350> open<00:06:25.130> e<00:06:25.310> would<00:06:26.150> be

00:06:26.410 --> 00:06:26.420 
that which would be this open e would be

00:06:26.420 --> 00:06:30.490 
that which would be this open e would be
the<00:06:26.780> four<00:06:27.230> so<00:06:27.980> now<00:06:28.010> using<00:06:28.940> this<00:06:29.150> not<00:06:30.080> only<00:06:30.350> do

00:06:30.490 --> 00:06:30.500 
the four so now using this not only do

00:06:30.500 --> 00:06:31.960 
the four so now using this not only do
you<00:06:30.620> have<00:06:30.770> to<00:06:30.920> play<00:06:31.130> all<00:06:31.370> the<00:06:31.550> notes<00:06:31.670> higher

00:06:31.960 --> 00:06:31.970 
you have to play all the notes higher

00:06:31.970 --> 00:06:36.190 
you have to play all the notes higher
but<00:06:32.420> using<00:06:32.960> the<00:06:33.260> octave<00:06:33.470> and<00:06:34.960> these<00:06:35.960> other

00:06:36.190 --> 00:06:36.200 
but using the octave and these other

00:06:36.200 --> 00:06:38.980 
but using the octave and these other
notes<00:06:36.410> you<00:06:37.010> got<00:06:37.220> these<00:06:37.460> low<00:06:37.730> notes<00:06:38.030> as<00:06:38.240> well<00:06:38.690> as

00:06:38.980 --> 00:06:38.990 
notes you got these low notes as well as

00:06:38.990 --> 00:06:41.610 
notes you got these low notes as well as
you<00:06:39.920> got<00:06:40.070> these<00:06:40.220> high<00:06:40.400> notes<00:06:40.640> to<00:06:40.850> choose<00:06:41.060> from

00:06:41.610 --> 00:06:41.620 
you got these high notes to choose from

00:06:41.620 --> 00:06:46.390 
you got these high notes to choose from
six<00:06:43.870> four<00:06:44.870> by<00:06:45.530> the<00:06:45.590> way<00:06:45.800> if<00:06:46.070> you're<00:06:46.220> wondering

00:06:46.390 --> 00:06:46.400 
six four by the way if you're wondering

00:06:46.400 --> 00:06:50.170 
six four by the way if you're wondering
where<00:06:46.880> I<00:06:46.910> got<00:06:47.060> this<00:06:47.540> six<00:06:48.130> right<00:06:49.130> here<00:06:49.430> you

00:06:50.170 --> 00:06:50.180 
where I got this six right here you

00:06:50.180 --> 00:06:53.140 
where I got this six right here you
remember<00:06:50.300> if<00:06:50.780> you<00:06:50.840> were<00:06:51.380> to<00:06:51.530> play<00:06:51.860> a<00:06:52.220> three

00:06:53.140 --> 00:06:53.150 
remember if you were to play a three

00:06:53.150 --> 00:06:55.960 
remember if you were to play a three
note<00:06:53.390> per<00:06:53.419> string<00:06:53.660> scale<00:06:54.610> that's<00:06:55.610> one<00:06:55.820> of<00:06:55.910> the

00:06:55.960 --> 00:06:55.970 
note per string scale that's one of the

00:06:55.970 --> 00:07:00.220 
note per string scale that's one of the
lessons<00:06:56.120> one<00:06:57.050> is<00:06:57.230> there<00:06:57.500> -<00:06:58.280> is<00:06:58.550> there<00:06:59.169> three<00:07:00.169> is

00:07:00.220 --> 00:07:00.230 
lessons one is there - is there three is

00:07:00.230 --> 00:07:03.870 
lessons one is there - is there three is
here<00:07:00.680> four<00:07:01.340> five<00:07:01.760> there's<00:07:02.180> a<00:07:02.240> six<00:07:02.630> up<00:07:02.870> here<00:07:03.320> and

00:07:03.870 --> 00:07:03.880 
here four five there's a six up here and

00:07:03.880 --> 00:07:07.440 
here four five there's a six up here and
taking<00:07:04.880> this<00:07:05.060> six<00:07:05.419> using<00:07:06.350> the<00:07:06.440> octave<00:07:06.710> rule

00:07:07.440 --> 00:07:07.450 
taking this six using the octave rule

00:07:07.450 --> 00:07:11.560 
taking this six using the octave rule
two<00:07:08.450> left<00:07:08.810> and<00:07:09.160> two<00:07:10.160> strings<00:07:10.700> higher<00:07:10.940> you<00:07:11.419> get

00:07:11.560 --> 00:07:11.570 
two left and two strings higher you get

00:07:11.570 --> 00:07:17.320 
two left and two strings higher you get
another<00:07:11.870> six<00:07:13.780> so<00:07:14.780> now<00:07:15.580> your<00:07:16.580> chord<00:07:16.850> charts<00:07:17.180> can

00:07:17.320 --> 00:07:17.330 
another six so now your chord charts can

00:07:17.330 --> 00:07:20.530 
another six so now your chord charts can
start<00:07:17.600> looking<00:07:17.900> like<00:07:18.380> this<00:07:19.010> and<00:07:19.820> how<00:07:19.910> simple

00:07:20.530 --> 00:07:20.540 
start looking like this and how simple

00:07:20.540 --> 00:07:22.630 
start looking like this and how simple
is<00:07:20.690> that<00:07:20.720> compared<00:07:21.380> to<00:07:21.410> using<00:07:21.830> you<00:07:22.250> know<00:07:22.340> chord

00:07:22.630 --> 00:07:22.640 
is that compared to using you know chord

00:07:22.640 --> 00:07:24.420 
is that compared to using you know chord
chart<00:07:22.850> with<00:07:22.970> lyrics<00:07:23.450> maybe<00:07:23.660> you<00:07:23.810> don't<00:07:23.990> know

00:07:24.420 --> 00:07:24.430 
chart with lyrics maybe you don't know

00:07:24.430 --> 00:07:27.880 
chart with lyrics maybe you don't know
it's<00:07:25.430> it<00:07:25.840> becomes<00:07:26.840> easy<00:07:27.200> to<00:07:27.290> not<00:07:27.530> only<00:07:27.680> write

00:07:27.880 --> 00:07:27.890 
it's it becomes easy to not only write

00:07:27.890 --> 00:07:29.650 
it's it becomes easy to not only write
progressions<00:07:28.490> but<00:07:28.550> basically<00:07:29.180> play<00:07:29.419> in<00:07:29.479> any

00:07:29.650 --> 00:07:29.660 
progressions but basically play in any

00:07:29.660 --> 00:07:32.050 
progressions but basically play in any
key<00:07:29.960> so<00:07:30.650> we'll<00:07:30.860> move<00:07:31.040> on<00:07:31.250> to<00:07:31.400> the<00:07:31.580> next<00:07:31.820> lesson

00:07:32.050 --> 00:07:32.060 
key so we'll move on to the next lesson

00:07:32.060 --> 00:07:33.909 
key so we'll move on to the next lesson
and<00:07:32.390> some<00:07:32.600> other<00:07:32.780> examples<00:07:33.380> to<00:07:33.560> make<00:07:33.590> this<00:07:33.860> a

00:07:33.909 --> 00:07:33.919 
and some other examples to make this a

00:07:33.919 --> 00:07:35.890 
and some other examples to make this a
little<00:07:34.160> more<00:07:34.340> difficult<00:07:34.910> but<00:07:35.479> that's<00:07:35.600> the

00:07:35.890 --> 00:07:35.900 
little more difficult but that's the

00:07:35.900 --> 00:07:39.300 
little more difficult but that's the
basic<00:07:36.440> lesson<00:07:36.860> in<00:07:37.070> getting<00:07:37.940> started<00:07:38.540> to<00:07:38.660> play

00:07:39.300 --> 00:07:39.310 
basic lesson in getting started to play
