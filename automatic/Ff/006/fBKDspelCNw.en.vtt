00:02:04.750 --> 00:02:11.449 
and half screen as it means half screen
and<00:02:05.880> so<00:02:06.880> you<00:02:06.939> it's<00:02:07.270> easy

00:02:11.449 --> 00:02:11.459 

00:02:11.459 --> 00:02:18.729 

as<00:02:11.579> much<00:02:11.819> as<00:02:12.230> being<00:02:13.230> you<00:02:14.810> does<00:02:15.810> not<00:02:15.840> Pikachu

00:02:18.729 --> 00:02:18.739 

00:02:18.739 --> 00:02:26.449 

yeah<00:02:21.980> okay<00:02:23.989> yes<00:02:24.989> so<00:02:25.439> that's<00:02:25.620> pretty<00:02:26.099> much<00:02:26.159> it

00:02:26.449 --> 00:02:26.459 
yeah okay yes so that's pretty much it

00:02:26.459 --> 00:02:29.899 
yeah okay yes so that's pretty much it
for<00:02:26.489> that<00:02:27.239> you<00:02:27.599> can<00:02:27.750> do<00:02:27.840> easy<00:02:28.109> side<00:02:28.409> by<00:02:28.590> side<00:02:28.909> so

00:02:29.899 --> 00:02:29.909 
for that you can do easy side by side so

00:02:29.909 --> 00:02:37.050 
for that you can do easy side by side so
let's<00:02:30.709> guess<00:02:31.709> Skype<00:02:32.010> you<00:02:32.129> can't<00:02:32.340> do<00:02:32.430> it<00:02:32.689> but

00:02:37.050 --> 00:02:37.060 

00:02:37.060 --> 00:02:39.300 

yeah<00:02:37.600> so<00:02:37.840> that's<00:02:38.020> a<00:02:38.319> really<00:02:38.530> easy<00:02:38.740> way<00:02:38.950> instead

00:02:39.300 --> 00:02:39.310 
yeah so that's a really easy way instead

00:02:39.310 --> 00:02:41.550 
yeah so that's a really easy way instead
of<00:02:39.400> clicking<00:02:40.060> dragon<00:02:40.630> making<00:02:40.990> perfect<00:02:41.230> you

00:02:41.550 --> 00:02:41.560 
of clicking dragon making perfect you

00:02:41.560 --> 00:02:43.710 
of clicking dragon making perfect you
could<00:02:41.740> do<00:02:41.860> that<00:02:42.010> but<00:02:42.250> I<00:02:42.550> think<00:02:43.000> this<00:02:43.270> is<00:02:43.390> easier

00:02:43.710 --> 00:02:43.720 
could do that but I think this is easier

00:02:43.720 --> 00:02:46.590 
could do that but I think this is easier
now<00:02:44.620> another<00:02:45.010> way<00:02:45.220> yeah<00:02:46.060> if<00:02:46.209> you<00:02:46.330> didn't<00:02:46.540> know

00:02:46.590 --> 00:02:46.600 
now another way yeah if you didn't know

00:02:46.600 --> 00:02:48.660 
now another way yeah if you didn't know
you<00:02:46.660> can<00:02:46.840> double<00:02:47.170> tap<00:02:47.200> the<00:02:47.440> top<00:02:47.620> and<00:02:47.890> like<00:02:48.430> make

00:02:48.660 --> 00:02:48.670 
you can double tap the top and like make

00:02:48.670 --> 00:02:50.880 
you can double tap the top and like make
it<00:02:48.790> smaller<00:02:49.030> and<00:02:49.209> bigger<00:02:49.300> zoom<00:02:50.170> to<00:02:50.380> the<00:02:50.530> full

00:02:50.880 --> 00:02:50.890 
it smaller and bigger zoom to the full

00:02:50.890 --> 00:02:55.440 
it smaller and bigger zoom to the full
screen<00:02:52.230> okay<00:02:53.230> well<00:02:53.850> there's<00:02:54.850> nothing<00:02:55.209> you<00:02:55.300> can

00:02:55.440 --> 00:02:55.450 
screen okay well there's nothing you can

00:02:55.450 --> 00:02:57.870 
screen okay well there's nothing you can
do<00:02:55.569> if<00:02:55.870> you<00:02:56.170> it's<00:02:56.440> really<00:02:56.680> small<00:02:56.980> so<00:02:57.520> double

00:02:57.870 --> 00:02:57.880 
do if you it's really small so double

00:02:57.880 --> 00:03:00.750 
do if you it's really small so double
tap<00:02:58.060> in<00:02:58.209> it<00:02:58.680> you<00:02:59.680> can<00:02:59.860> drag<00:03:00.310> it<00:03:00.430> all<00:03:00.550> the<00:03:00.640> way<00:03:00.730> up

00:03:00.750 --> 00:03:00.760 
tap in it you can drag it all the way up

00:03:00.760 --> 00:03:02.910 
tap in it you can drag it all the way up
to<00:03:01.150> the<00:03:01.300> top<00:03:01.660> and<00:03:01.930> then<00:03:02.260> have<00:03:02.440> the<00:03:02.530> glass<00:03:02.739> you

00:03:02.910 --> 00:03:02.920 
to the top and then have the glass you

00:03:02.920 --> 00:03:04.199 
to the top and then have the glass you
look<00:03:03.100> throughout<00:03:03.370> the<00:03:03.489> whole<00:03:03.670> screen<00:03:03.970> and

00:03:04.199 --> 00:03:04.209 
look throughout the whole screen and

00:03:04.209 --> 00:03:08.550 
look throughout the whole screen and
then<00:03:04.510> it<00:03:04.720> will<00:03:04.840> just<00:03:04.959> maximize<00:03:05.650> it<00:03:05.860> and<00:03:07.560> that's

00:03:08.550 --> 00:03:08.560 
then it will just maximize it and that's

00:03:08.560 --> 00:03:11.310 
then it will just maximize it and that's
pretty<00:03:09.160> much<00:03:09.310> it<00:03:09.570> if<00:03:10.570> you<00:03:10.690> guys<00:03:10.840> have<00:03:11.080> any
