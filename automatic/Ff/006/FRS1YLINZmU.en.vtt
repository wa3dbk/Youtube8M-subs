00:00:03.010 --> 00:00:05.430
 2 

00:00:14.389 --> 00:00:17.389
 such 

00:00:31.750 --> 00:00:36.830
 so I followed my godmother is so 

00:00:33.950 --> 00:00:39.329
 in a yard he killed about two or 

00:00:36.830 --> 00:00:41.249
 three rounds is so 

00:00:39.329 --> 00:00:42.480
 you do not have boundaries and I imitated 

00:00:41.249 --> 00:00:45.570
 often the bad ones who knows where 

00:00:42.480 --> 00:00:47.309
 the barriers or trying I'm 

00:00:45.570 --> 00:00:49.649
 remember as the story is by 

00:00:47.309 --> 00:00:51.329
 example a horse that was disunited who 

00:00:49.649 --> 00:00:53.250
 galloped with the turn behind 

00:00:51.329 --> 00:00:56.070
 but when I returned I imitated his horse 

00:00:53.250 --> 00:00:59.939
 who gallops and fake with the head in 

00:00:56.070 --> 00:01:02.539
 look all that and then here's a real 

00:00:59.939 --> 00:01:07.129
 passion it prevents sleep 

00:01:02.539 --> 00:01:07.129
 kim that makes me deep down 

00:01:07.750 --> 00:01:10.810
 m 

00:01:09.390 --> 00:01:13.020
 a 

00:01:10.810 --> 00:01:13.020
 2 

00:01:30.310 --> 00:01:33.310
 12 

00:01:35.050 --> 00:01:37.680
 m 

00:01:40.850 --> 00:01:43.850
 the 

00:01:54.290 --> 00:01:58.890
 for the show for example when he 

00:01:57.030 --> 00:02:00.480
 must go nine times on tour nine 

00:01:58.890 --> 00:02:03.030
 month turn that represents five 

00:02:00.480 --> 00:02:04.920
 weekend shows 

00:02:03.030 --> 00:02:07.049
 so it's huge to hold a horse 

00:02:04.920 --> 00:02:09.000
 over nine months five shows by 

00:02:07.049 --> 00:02:13.470
 weekend is really must have 

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:14.220
 a mind out of the ordinary and have you 

00:02:13.470 --> 00:02:16.800
 ace 

00:02:14.220 --> 00:02:18.510
 selects the horses a lot and 

00:02:16.800 --> 00:02:19.920
 I would say a little bit for the 

00:02:18.510 --> 00:02:20.970
 bullfighting because at the base the 

00:02:19.920 --> 00:02:22.380
 Lusitano was a little bit 

00:02:20.970 --> 00:02:23.010
 selected for the origins 

00:02:22.380 --> 00:02:25.680
 bullfighting 

00:02:23.010 --> 00:02:27.330
 it was a little bit designed for that and 

00:02:25.680 --> 00:02:28.710
 they're looking for it because that's their 

00:02:27.330 --> 00:02:30.420
 give it a little chauvauds 

00:02:28.710 --> 00:02:32.310
 warrior who will go all the way 

00:02:30.420 --> 00:02:33.570
 that they are going to have a big heart a 

00:02:32.310 --> 00:02:36.720
 great condition 

00:02:33.570 --> 00:02:38.040
 and suddenly it allows us to leave nine 

00:02:36.720 --> 00:02:40.080
 months on tour to have no problem 

00:02:38.040 --> 00:02:42.680
 for nine months to have horses in 

00:02:40.080 --> 00:02:42.680
 good shape
