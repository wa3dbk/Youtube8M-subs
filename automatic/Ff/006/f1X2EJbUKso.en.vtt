00:02:52.040 --> 00:02:52.050 
started to fit in and show what I could

00:02:52.050 --> 00:02:53.930 
started to fit in and show what I could
do<00:02:52.290> especially<00:02:52.680> I<00:02:53.130> think<00:02:53.340> I've<00:02:53.580> just<00:02:53.640> been<00:02:53.880> a

00:02:53.930 --> 00:02:53.940 
do especially I think I've just been a

00:02:53.940 --> 00:02:56.270 
do especially I think I've just been a
lot<00:02:54.090> more<00:02:54.150> composed<00:02:54.660> and<00:02:55.050> calm<00:02:55.980> out<00:02:56.130> of<00:02:56.220> the

00:02:56.270 --> 00:02:56.280 
lot more composed and calm out of the

00:02:56.280 --> 00:02:57.440 
lot more composed and calm out of the
back<00:02:56.460> because<00:02:56.700> we're<00:02:56.880> team<00:02:57.090> that<00:02:57.210> likes<00:02:57.270> to

00:02:57.440 --> 00:02:57.450 
back because we're team that likes to

00:02:57.450 --> 00:02:59.030 
back because we're team that likes to
play<00:02:57.600> out<00:02:57.660> of<00:02:57.750> the<00:02:57.810> back<00:02:57.960> so<00:02:58.230> my<00:02:58.740> distribution

00:02:59.030 --> 00:02:59.040 
play out of the back so my distribution

00:02:59.040 --> 00:03:01.250 
play out of the back so my distribution
has<00:02:59.370> also<00:02:59.550> been<00:02:59.760> a<00:02:59.790> key<00:02:59.970> factor<00:03:00.180> and<00:03:00.600> I<00:03:00.960> think

00:03:01.250 --> 00:03:01.260 
has also been a key factor and I think

00:03:01.260 --> 00:03:02.420 
has also been a key factor and I think
the<00:03:01.320> coaches<00:03:01.530> have<00:03:01.740> been<00:03:01.770> really<00:03:02.010> happy<00:03:02.220> with

00:03:02.420 --> 00:03:02.430 
the coaches have been really happy with

00:03:02.430 --> 00:03:04.700 
the coaches have been really happy with
that<00:03:02.550> so<00:03:02.850> just<00:03:03.570> trying<00:03:03.810> to<00:03:03.870> keep<00:03:04.140> the<00:03:04.500> team<00:03:04.680> in

that so just trying to keep the team in

00:03:04.710 --> 00:03:06.020 
that so just trying to keep the team in
control<00:03:05.100> and<00:03:05.250> keep<00:03:05.340> the<00:03:05.430> team<00:03:05.580> in<00:03:05.610> possession

00:03:16.580 --> 00:03:16.590 
season yeah and I think that's got to be

00:03:16.590 --> 00:03:19.040 
season yeah and I think that's got to be
you<00:03:16.920> know<00:03:17.040> the<00:03:17.070> goal<00:03:17.370> for<00:03:17.400> our<00:03:17.700> youth<00:03:18.270> programs

to<00:03:20.730> this<00:03:20.880> team<00:03:21.120> and<00:03:21.150> there<00:03:21.390> is<00:03:21.480> a<00:03:21.510> chance<00:03:21.810> to

00:03:21.890 --> 00:03:21.900 
to this team and there is a chance to
