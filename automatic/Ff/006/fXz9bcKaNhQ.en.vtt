00:00:07.130 --> 00:00:12.599
 darling my friends hello everyone 

00:00:10.440 --> 00:00:15.450
 to pass you on to povsevarim in mind i 

00:00:12.599 --> 00:00:19.619
 Vitali I honestly do not know how you 

00:00:15.450 --> 00:00:21.330
 but I personally adore all kinds of rolls 

00:00:19.619 --> 00:00:24.750
 meat vegetables 

00:00:21.330 --> 00:00:26.699
 I especially like eggplant rolls 

00:00:24.750 --> 00:00:28.820
 generally cooked in my opinion 

00:00:26.699 --> 00:00:31.560
 dish which is rolled up 

00:00:28.820 --> 00:00:33.750
 automatically adds some dish 

00:00:31.560 --> 00:00:35.070
 Points to taste now honestly 

00:00:33.750 --> 00:00:37.559
 saying I don't know, but I meant that 

00:00:35.070 --> 00:00:40.140
 rolls they are a priori more tasty 

00:00:37.559 --> 00:00:42.329
 more tasty not rolls I'm in one of my 

00:00:40.140 --> 00:00:45.059
 first issues preparing rolls from 

00:00:42.329 --> 00:00:47.129
 eggplant cheese this is a freaky dish i 

00:00:45.059 --> 00:00:49.230
 I constantly do it because it is very 

00:00:47.129 --> 00:00:52.199
 delicious suited on the holiday table 

00:00:49.230 --> 00:00:55.140
 and today I will show how to make eggplants 

00:00:52.199 --> 00:00:57.300
 with carrot carrot us will be the peak 

00:00:55.140 --> 00:00:59.399
 carrot we will have piquant 

00:00:57.300 --> 00:01:01.350
 very sharp little so it too 

00:00:59.399 --> 00:01:03.329
 great snack for the holiday table 

00:01:01.350 --> 00:01:06.210
 the first thing we need is two 

00:01:03.329 --> 00:01:08.880
 eggplant still we need two very 

00:01:06.210 --> 00:01:10.860
 medium garlic carrots 3 cloves 

00:01:08.880 --> 00:01:13.170
 we will also need salt and pepper 

00:01:10.860 --> 00:01:15.420
 vegetable oil we still need 

00:01:13.170 --> 00:01:17.880
 a little flour for scalding eggplant and 

00:01:15.420 --> 00:01:19.950
 dill dill exclusively with us 

00:01:17.880 --> 00:01:22.340
 for the sake of decoration, we will sprinkle it ready 

00:01:19.950 --> 00:01:22.340
 rolls 

00:01:29.640 --> 00:01:34.450
 Generally eggplant season, in principle, not 

00:01:32.469 --> 00:01:36.340
 gorchat us in Moscow in particular 

00:01:34.450 --> 00:01:38.259
 eggplants are sold almost round 

00:01:36.340 --> 00:01:40.539
 year and understand when they have a season when not 

00:01:38.259 --> 00:01:41.920
 season is very difficult principle we consider 

00:01:40.539 --> 00:01:43.750
 the default is that eggplants should 

00:01:41.920 --> 00:01:46.119
 bitter to get rid of bitterness 

00:01:43.750 --> 00:01:47.500
 sprinkle eggplant with salt but 

00:01:46.119 --> 00:01:50.079
 preliminaries must be cut into 

00:01:47.500 --> 00:01:52.590
 plate thickness but somewhere millimeter 

00:01:50.079 --> 00:01:52.590
 four 

00:02:07.390 --> 00:02:12.140
 as I said sprinkle eggplant salt 

00:02:10.400 --> 00:02:14.900
 we will begin to stand out juice and bitterness 

00:02:12.140 --> 00:02:16.700
 will be from eggplant to go where she 

00:02:14.900 --> 00:02:20.170
 I will not know, but the main thing is to 

00:02:16.700 --> 00:02:20.170
 she left eggplant 

00:02:27.270 --> 00:02:31.270
 then plate with eggplant need 

00:02:29.680 --> 00:02:34.590
 rinse under running water and 

00:02:31.270 --> 00:02:34.590
 pretty dry 

00:02:43.430 --> 00:02:49.400
 every eggplant plate is good 

00:02:46.260 --> 00:02:49.400
 we roll in flour 

00:02:55.970 --> 00:03:00.390
 fry in a frying pan with hot 

00:02:58.560 --> 00:03:02.160
 vegetable oil until 

00:03:00.390 --> 00:03:03.750
 golden brown fry 

00:03:02.160 --> 00:03:06.200
 Naturally from two sides and you are 

00:03:03.750 --> 00:03:06.200
 do you understand 

00:03:21.280 --> 00:03:27.490
 Now it's a matter of stuffing a carrot we rub on 

00:03:24.530 --> 00:03:27.490
 coarse grater 

00:03:29.620 --> 00:03:34.810
 fry carrots on vegetable 

00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:34.810
 oil until soft 

00:03:41.810 --> 00:03:46.770
 one and a half minutes before the end of cooking 

00:03:44.850 --> 00:03:49.580
 add chopped carrots or 

00:03:46.770 --> 00:03:49.580
 squeezed garlic 

00:04:01.160 --> 00:04:04.650
 add salt and optionally possible 

00:04:03.390 --> 00:04:14.580
 add black pepper 

00:04:04.650 --> 00:04:16.709

00:04:14.580 --> 00:04:19.049
 just form rolls in this no 

00:04:16.709 --> 00:04:20.600
 nothing complicated on eggplants and records 

00:04:19.049 --> 00:04:25.280
 spread out a few teaspoons 

00:04:20.600 --> 00:04:25.280
