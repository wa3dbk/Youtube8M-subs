00:00:35.959 --> 00:00:35.969 
I'm pretty impressed only need a little

00:00:35.969 --> 00:00:39.139 
I'm pretty impressed only need a little
bit<00:00:36.180> of<00:00:36.270> tweaking<00:00:36.480> the<00:00:37.050> truss<00:00:37.680> rod<00:00:37.800> and<00:00:38.399> I

00:00:39.139 --> 00:00:39.149 
bit of tweaking the truss rod and I

00:00:39.149 --> 00:00:45.440 
bit of tweaking the truss rod and I
flipped<00:00:40.190> the<00:00:41.870> strings<00:00:42.870> so<00:00:43.170> that<00:00:43.579> the<00:00:44.579> they

00:00:45.440 --> 00:00:45.450 
flipped the strings so that the they

00:00:45.450 --> 00:00:47.299 
flipped the strings so that the they
went<00:00:45.690> under<00:00:46.020> the<00:00:46.140> tail<00:00:46.350> piece<00:00:46.620> to<00:00:46.980> give<00:00:47.100> better

00:00:47.299 --> 00:00:47.309 
went under the tail piece to give better

00:00:47.309 --> 00:00:49.340 
went under the tail piece to give better
down<00:00:47.550> pressure<00:00:47.940> on<00:00:48.600> the<00:00:48.719> back<00:00:48.870> of<00:00:49.050> the<00:00:49.140> saddle

00:00:49.340 --> 00:00:49.350 
down pressure on the back of the saddle

00:00:49.350 --> 00:00:51.470 
down pressure on the back of the saddle
because<00:00:49.829> they<00:00:50.610> were<00:00:50.730> flopping<00:00:51.059> out<00:00:51.329> of<00:00:51.420> the

00:00:51.470 --> 00:00:51.480 
because they were flopping out of the

00:00:51.480 --> 00:00:53.119 
because they were flopping out of the
slots<00:00:51.750> and<00:00:51.989> not<00:00:52.140> getting<00:00:52.620> a<00:00:52.739> lot<00:00:52.829> of<00:00:52.890> damn

00:00:53.119 --> 00:00:53.129 
slots and not getting a lot of damn

00:00:53.129 --> 00:00:56.779 
slots and not getting a lot of damn
pressure<00:00:53.460> when<00:00:53.789> it<00:00:53.910> first<00:00:54.270> arrived<00:00:55.579> but<00:00:56.579> um

00:00:56.779 --> 00:00:56.789 
pressure when it first arrived but um

00:00:56.789 --> 00:00:58.610 
pressure when it first arrived but um
you<00:00:57.180> know<00:00:57.210> it's<00:00:57.420> real<00:00:57.600> cool<00:00:57.809> instrument<00:00:58.320> lots

00:00:58.610 --> 00:00:58.620 
you know it's real cool instrument lots

00:02:02.700 --> 00:02:06.960 

tremendous<00:02:03.700> amount<00:02:04.000> of<00:02:04.090> sustain<00:02:04.770> so<00:02:05.849> you<00:02:06.849> know

00:02:06.960 --> 00:02:06.970 
tremendous amount of sustain so you know

00:02:06.970 --> 00:02:09.180 
tremendous amount of sustain so you know
if<00:02:07.149> it's<00:02:07.530> their<00:02:08.530> advantages<00:02:09.130> and

00:02:09.180 --> 00:02:09.190 
if it's their advantages and

00:02:09.190 --> 00:02:11.190 
if it's their advantages and
disadvantages<00:02:09.940> one<00:02:10.509> thing<00:02:10.810> that's<00:02:11.019> cool

00:02:11.190 --> 00:02:11.200 
disadvantages one thing that's cool

00:02:11.200 --> 00:02:14.610 
disadvantages one thing that's cool
about<00:02:11.260> this<00:02:11.560> is<00:02:11.739> it<00:02:11.890> it<00:02:12.160> really<00:02:12.579> sounds<00:02:13.060> a<00:02:13.620> lot

00:02:14.610 --> 00:02:14.620 
about this is it it really sounds a lot

00:02:14.620 --> 00:02:17.460 
about this is it it really sounds a lot
like<00:02:14.680> a<00:02:14.890> piano<00:02:15.280> you<00:02:15.489> when<00:02:16.269> you<00:02:16.390> play<00:02:16.720> a<00:02:16.750> chord

00:02:17.460 --> 00:02:17.470 
like a piano you when you play a chord

00:02:17.470 --> 00:02:31.470 
like a piano you when you play a chord
so<00:02:17.860> for<00:02:18.340> instance

00:02:31.470 --> 00:02:31.480 

00:02:31.480 --> 00:02:37.570 

that's<00:02:32.480> really<00:02:33.170> cool<00:02:33.560> it's<00:02:33.860> like<00:02:36.280> it<00:02:37.280> was<00:02:37.400> like

00:02:37.570 --> 00:02:37.580 
that's really cool it's like it was like

00:02:37.580 --> 00:02:39.699 
that's really cool it's like it was like
a<00:02:37.610> piano<00:02:38.209> across<00:02:38.629> with<00:02:38.840> the<00:02:38.900> marimba<00:02:39.200> and<00:02:39.410> I

00:02:39.699 --> 00:02:39.709 
a piano across with the marimba and I

00:02:39.709 --> 00:02:41.650 
a piano across with the marimba and I
think<00:02:40.160> that<00:02:40.400> that<00:02:40.550> could<00:02:40.819> open<00:02:40.910> up<00:02:41.120> all<00:02:41.360> sorts

00:02:41.650 --> 00:02:41.660 
think that that could open up all sorts

00:02:41.660 --> 00:02:43.119 
think that that could open up all sorts
of<00:02:41.720> different<00:02:41.900> playing<00:02:42.260> styles<00:02:42.379> with<00:02:42.920> this

00:02:43.119 --> 00:02:43.129 
of different playing styles with this

00:02:43.129 --> 00:02:50.149 
of different playing styles with this
because<00:02:43.370> it<00:02:43.610> doesn't<00:02:43.760> have<00:02:44.000> that<00:02:45.849> place

00:02:50.149 --> 00:02:50.159 

00:02:50.159 --> 00:02:52.979 

we're<00:02:51.159> even<00:02:51.400> on<00:02:51.519> that<00:02:51.730> on<00:02:52.060> a<00:02:52.209> big<00:02:52.480> standard

00:02:52.979 --> 00:02:52.989 
we're even on that on a big standard

00:02:52.989 --> 00:02:54.449 
we're even on that on a big standard
base<00:02:53.170> those<00:02:53.409> kind<00:02:53.650> of<00:02:53.709> cords<00:02:54.069> would<00:02:54.189> sound

00:02:54.449 --> 00:02:54.459 
base those kind of cords would sound

00:02:54.459 --> 00:02:57.809 
base those kind of cords would sound
