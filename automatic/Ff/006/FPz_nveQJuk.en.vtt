00:00:02.770 --> 00:00:05.399
 4 

00:00:06.870 --> 00:00:13.110
 Happy world to meet with respect 

00:00:09.120 --> 00:00:16.410
 Hi wipe a loan 

00:00:13.110 --> 00:00:20.970
 From paper to now and to you in the future 

00:00:16.410 --> 00:00:26.310
 It's a creator who broadcasts on the theme of the bell. 

00:00:20.970 --> 00:00:31.079
 Teach that you can have any kind of models that in the first 

00:00:26.310 --> 00:00:32.820
 I would like to continue with the broadcast that I would like to offer you and help you. 

00:00:31.079 --> 00:00:35.820
 The expected 

00:00:32.820 --> 00:00:39.960
 Now there's one thing I show you. 

00:00:35.820 --> 00:00:43.170
 For example, should you well know per burst it.I thought 

00:00:39.960 --> 00:00:49.500
 Have you ever seen a pound like this? 

00:00:43.170 --> 00:00:53.730
 Yeah , it's not a model, so you probably never saw it. 

00:00:49.500 --> 00:00:57.090
 I 've shown you how to do it with web wrapping . Papercraft 

00:00:53.730 --> 00:01:01.170
 And if you ask me to look at everything 

00:00:57.090 --> 00:01:05.930
 What is this? 

00:01:01.170 --> 00:01:12.810
 The servant tells tg to live with Abraham 

00:01:05.930 --> 00:01:18.659
 But it's not like that. 

00:01:12.810 --> 00:01:23.340
 You have this really about whether the dopum quality of Hull's Plastic Model 

00:01:18.659 --> 00:01:29.010
 So you can create these works, I help deuryeotgo 

00:01:23.340 --> 00:01:34.229
 In fact, the gun is a material that's easily available 

00:01:29.010 --> 00:01:39.810
 Easy to cut and can be obtained easily and the paste with it 

00:01:34.229 --> 00:01:43.470
 It is easy to cut, so if you change your mind a little, 

00:01:39.810 --> 00:01:49.200
 Much more easily accessible than 

00:01:43.470 --> 00:01:52.979
 That's the material, so I taught you this paper model. 

00:01:49.200 --> 00:01:57.420
 Do you think you could have a lot I can assure you that even while 

00:01:52.979 --> 00:02:00.450
 But I still do not know the strength to 

00:01:57.420 --> 00:02:06.390
 It is true that there is a spirit clearly. 

00:02:00.450 --> 00:02:08.759
 If the paper can be to some extent the fact that being first or last such limitations are 

00:02:06.390 --> 00:02:12.810
 I do not think I have it. 

00:02:08.759 --> 00:02:16.169
 It's not like this, but mimics it alike. 

00:02:12.810 --> 00:02:20.159
 You guys, this is just the beginning. 

00:02:16.169 --> 00:02:25.650
 The different look that's all you have 

00:02:20.159 --> 00:02:27.779
 This is a paper model is that you can make the paper as desired, 

00:02:25.650 --> 00:02:31.650
 It is a very big attraction. 

00:02:27.779 --> 00:02:37.470
 As a professional stage, you can actually create one for yourself. 

00:02:31.650 --> 00:02:40.080
 If you want to be a resin, you might say a bit early 1 1 4 4g 

00:02:37.470 --> 00:02:45.390
 Oh , really, how much work was there? 

00:02:40.080 --> 00:02:48.750
 There are even some 3d printers these days that can do even that 

00:02:45.390 --> 00:02:52.650
 It's wide and expensive. Oh, it's hard to imagine. 

00:02:48.750 --> 00:02:57.180
 But on paper dalrayo paper models it is 

00:02:52.650 --> 00:03:00.570
 I can do it again. 

00:02:57.180 --> 00:03:05.160
 You can make it, yeah . 

00:03:00.570 --> 00:03:05.940
 The possibility that you are doing is broader, but it is presented 

00:03:05.160 --> 00:03:11.430
 I think 

00:03:05.940 --> 00:03:14.400
 Forward to show a lot of what comes to you again bojiman made with 

00:03:11.430 --> 00:03:17.910
 I'll have it. 

00:03:14.400 --> 00:03:19.650
 The priest makes a chat. 

00:03:17.910 --> 00:03:23.130
 You knew you made your head like that. 

00:03:19.650 --> 00:03:26.430
 4 Absolutely not. 

00:03:23.130 --> 00:03:29.970
 Again, I like the Gundam so much. 

00:03:26.430 --> 00:03:33.750
 We 're actually making a lot of stuff in crowds per case. 

00:03:29.970 --> 00:03:39.000
 I have made many pro stages for each of them. 

00:03:33.750 --> 00:03:40.800
 But it's more fun and more fun to make paper than Gundam Plastic Model. 

00:03:39.000 --> 00:03:46.470
 The larger the 4 

00:03:40.800 --> 00:03:52.170
 So do we create this piece of paper I'm showing are 

00:03:46.470 --> 00:03:56.420
 Of course, it is not a commercial product on the market, 

00:03:52.170 --> 00:03:59.760
 If the bell is shaped and you take it more , these more wonderful works 

00:03:56.420 --> 00:04:04.430
 I think you can meet any number of people. 

00:03:59.760 --> 00:04:04.430
 I do not want to make this work with me 

00:04:05.660 --> 00:04:14.360
 Well, maybe. 

00:04:08.570 --> 00:04:15.620
 Well, why I even for those who go to sleep conflict with real paper 

00:04:14.360 --> 00:04:18.650
 I prepared 

00:04:15.620 --> 00:04:26.870
 It's a total of two trillion four species. 

00:04:18.650 --> 00:04:31.850
 I want you to know what I'm making. Zeta Gundam That's not cool. 

00:04:26.870 --> 00:04:33.080
 Oh, I get four Are not you going eda itja dimmed that one major group 3 

00:04:31.850 --> 00:04:40.190
 It's important. 

00:04:33.080 --> 00:04:40.880
 Anyway, I have to create a base in Red Book species in the Examples section cut part 

00:04:40.190 --> 00:04:45.350
 For 

00:04:40.880 --> 00:04:50.660
 I'm just part of that term lumbar v 

00:04:45.350 --> 00:04:53.630
 Yeah, but I'll not going to does not is a real right kind of paper saying Tello 

00:04:50.660 --> 00:04:58.040
 5 Definitely yes . 

00:04:53.630 --> 00:05:01.190
 That's why I can talk about it as a paper. 

00:04:58.040 --> 00:05:06.080
 Gundam's not only thou make 

00:05:01.190 --> 00:05:10.640
 The other guy is going to sit 4 Oh geureoneyo 

00:05:06.080 --> 00:05:14.300
 Key Example Participation As I said Buttering 

00:05:10.640 --> 00:05:18.110
 Yorake Yorake Yorake Yorake Yorake Yorake Yorake Yorake have a look at the industry 

00:05:14.300 --> 00:05:21.440
 Cute Shaped Paper Toy

 I have not seen you for the first time. 

00:05:21.440 --> 00:05:27.770
 That's what your designer did. 

00:05:24.710 --> 00:05:34.640
 Not open to you, but 

00:05:27.770 --> 00:05:36.110
 Do you promise to be able to meet them when you get a chance ? 

00:05:34.640 --> 00:05:41.930

 I did not show you. 

00:05:46.820 --> 00:05:56.360
 A tank can be an airplane. It's done with paper. 

00:05:52.160 --> 00:06:02.720
 Again, do not talk about boyfriend girlfriends. 

00:05:56.360 --> 00:06:07.220

 I would like to share with you a lot of people in the future.
