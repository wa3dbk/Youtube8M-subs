00:00:06.349 --> 00:00:06.359 
love showing this trick because the

00:00:06.359 --> 00:00:08.390 
love showing this trick because the
spectator<00:00:06.930> is<00:00:07.140> pretty<00:00:07.680> much<00:00:07.799> doing<00:00:07.980> all<00:00:08.280> the

00:00:08.390 --> 00:00:08.400

00:00:10.800 --> 00:00:12.290 
work and you get a really neat little
coincidence<00:00:11.370> at<00:00:11.550> the<00:00:11.700> end<00:00:11.820> I<00:00:11.940> call<00:00:12.210> it

00:00:12.290 --> 00:00:12.300 
coincidence at the end I call it

00:00:12.300 --> 00:00:14.810 
coincidence at the end I call it
clean-cut<00:00:12.570> coincidence<00:00:13.530> all<00:00:13.769> right<00:00:13.950> now

00:00:14.810 --> 00:00:14.820

00:01:27.469 --> 00:01:27.479 
I simply took out these two cards right

00:01:27.479 --> 00:01:29.870 
I simply took out these two cards right
here<00:01:27.960> now<00:01:28.530> matter<00:01:28.979> you<00:01:29.400> know<00:01:29.520> even<00:01:29.790> though

00:01:29.870 --> 00:01:29.880 
here now matter you know even though

00:01:29.880 --> 00:01:31.640 
here now matter you know even though
you've<00:01:30.000> had<00:01:30.030> such<00:01:30.299> a<00:01:30.329> free<00:01:30.659> choice<00:01:30.960> you'll<00:01:31.500> be

00:01:31.640 --> 00:01:31.650 
you've had such a free choice you'll be

00:01:31.650 --> 00:01:34.039 
you've had such a free choice you'll be
surprised<00:01:32.040> to<00:01:32.189> see<00:01:32.369> this<00:01:32.640> card<00:01:32.909> is<00:01:33.090> the<00:01:33.240> ten<00:01:33.900> of

00:01:34.039 --> 00:01:34.049 
surprised to see this card is the ten of

00:01:34.049 --> 00:01:36.469 
surprised to see this card is the ten of
clubs<00:01:34.229> and<00:01:34.680> over<00:01:35.520> here<00:01:35.759> the<00:01:35.970> next<00:01:36.150> card<00:01:36.390> you

00:01:36.469 --> 00:01:36.479 
clubs and over here the next card you

00:01:36.479 --> 00:01:39.649 
clubs and over here the next card you
chose<00:01:36.720> was<00:01:36.960> the<00:01:37.250> ten<00:01:38.250> of<00:01:38.369> Spades<00:01:38.759> a<00:01:39.090> perfect

00:01:39.649 --> 00:01:39.659 
chose was the ten of Spades a perfect

00:01:39.659 --> 00:01:41.510 
chose was the ten of Spades a perfect
match<00:01:40.110> just<00:01:40.619> like<00:01:40.740> that<00:01:40.950> and<00:01:41.100> that's<00:01:41.159> the<00:01:41.340> neat

00:01:41.510 --> 00:01:41.520 
match just like that and that's the neat

00:01:41.520 --> 00:01:42.830 
match just like that and that's the neat
little<00:01:41.670> coincidence<00:01:42.240> but<00:01:42.509> you<00:01:42.600> know<00:01:42.720> what's

00:01:42.830 --> 00:01:42.840 
little coincidence but you know what's

00:01:42.840 --> 00:01:44.569 
little coincidence but you know what's
even<00:01:42.960> more<00:01:43.110> surprising<00:01:43.380> before<00:01:44.159> we<00:01:44.310> began

00:01:44.569 --> 00:01:44.579 
even more surprising before we began

00:01:44.579 --> 00:01:46.460 
even more surprising before we began
this<00:01:44.759> trick<00:01:45.030> I<00:01:45.270> actually<00:01:45.840> made<00:01:46.200> a<00:01:46.229> little

00:01:46.460 --> 00:01:46.470 
this trick I actually made a little

00:01:46.470 --> 00:01:47.899 
this trick I actually made a little
prediction<00:01:46.860> and<00:01:47.130> that's<00:01:47.340> been<00:01:47.490> in<00:01:47.610> the<00:01:47.700> box

00:01:47.899 --> 00:01:47.909 
prediction and that's been in the box

00:01:47.909 --> 00:01:49.100 
prediction and that's been in the box
the<00:01:48.149> whole<00:01:48.180> time

00:01:49.100 --> 00:01:49.110 
the whole time

00:01:49.110 --> 00:01:51.980 
the whole time
and<00:01:49.560> it<00:01:49.829> says<00:01:50.220> you<00:01:50.759> will<00:01:50.880> select<00:01:51.329> the<00:01:51.720> black

00:01:51.980 --> 00:01:51.990 
and it says you will select the black

00:01:51.990 --> 00:01:54.080 
and it says you will select the black
tens<00:01:52.380> and<00:01:52.560> I<00:01:52.649> believe<00:01:52.950> unless<00:01:53.549> I'm<00:01:53.790> colorblind

00:01:54.080 --> 00:01:54.090 
tens and I believe unless I'm colorblind

00:01:54.090 --> 00:01:56.959 
tens and I believe unless I'm colorblind
these<00:01:54.810> are<00:01:55.020> the<00:01:55.380> black<00:01:55.530> tens<00:01:55.950> that's<00:01:56.850> the

00:01:56.959 --> 00:01:56.969 
these are the black tens that's the

00:01:56.969 --> 00:01:59.209 
these are the black tens that's the
trick<00:01:57.180> guys<00:01:57.380> that's<00:01:58.380> the<00:01:58.680> quick<00:01:59.040> performance

00:01:59.209 --> 00:01:59.219 
trick guys that's the quick performance

00:01:59.219 --> 00:02:01.760 
trick guys that's the quick performance
let<00:01:59.880> me<00:01:59.969> go<00:02:00.090> right<00:02:00.360> into<00:02:00.540> the<00:02:00.840> tutorial<00:02:01.200> right

are going to need is a little gimmick
card<00:02:24.520> and<00:02:24.700> that's<00:02:24.760> a<00:02:24.910> double<00:02:25.150> backer<00:02:25.540> now<00:02:26.110> guys

00:02:26.280 --> 00:02:26.290 
card and that's a double backer now guys

00:02:26.290 --> 00:02:28.740 
card and that's a double backer now guys
don't<00:02:26.500> run<00:02:26.680> away<00:02:26.800> and<00:02:27.670> this<00:02:27.760> is<00:02:28.060> not<00:02:28.300> going<00:02:28.510> to

00:02:28.740 --> 00:02:28.750 
don't run away and this is not going to

00:02:28.750 --> 00:02:30.270 
don't run away and this is not going to
be<00:02:28.840> a<00:02:28.870> pain<00:02:29.200> alright<00:02:29.740> this<00:02:29.890> isn't<00:02:30.070> gonna<00:02:30.220> be

00:02:30.270 --> 00:02:30.280 
be a pain alright this isn't gonna be

00:02:30.280 --> 00:02:32.910 
be a pain alright this isn't gonna be
that<00:02:30.400> difficult<00:02:30.790> to<00:02:31.090> hide<00:02:31.410> and<00:02:32.410> it<00:02:32.530> is<00:02:32.680> worth

00:02:32.910 --> 00:02:32.920 
that difficult to hide and it is worth

00:02:32.920 --> 00:02:35.400 
that difficult to hide and it is worth
making<00:02:33.220> as<00:02:33.520> you<00:02:33.550> can<00:02:33.760> see<00:02:33.970> by<00:02:34.120> the<00:02:34.180> trick<00:02:34.570> so<00:02:35.320> it

00:02:35.400 --> 00:02:35.410 
making as you can see by the trick so it

00:02:35.410 --> 00:02:36.840 
making as you can see by the trick so it
is<00:02:35.500> a<00:02:35.530> double<00:02:35.680> back<00:02:35.980> or<00:02:36.160> now<00:02:36.250> if<00:02:36.310> any<00:02:36.580> of<00:02:36.700> you

00:02:36.840 --> 00:02:36.850 
is a double back or now if any of you

00:02:36.850 --> 00:02:39.570 
is a double back or now if any of you
have<00:02:37.150> ordered<00:02:37.390> any<00:02:37.690> decks<00:02:37.990> from<00:02:38.200> theory<00:02:38.500> 11<00:02:38.980> as

00:02:39.570 --> 00:02:39.580 
have ordered any decks from theory 11 as

00:02:39.580 --> 00:02:41.880 
have ordered any decks from theory 11 as
you<00:02:39.670> can<00:02:39.820> see<00:02:39.940> right<00:02:40.090> there<00:02:40.390> most<00:02:41.020> often<00:02:41.350> they

00:02:41.880 --> 00:02:41.890 
you can see right there most often they

00:02:41.890 --> 00:02:43.710 
you can see right there most often they
come<00:02:42.220> with<00:02:42.400> a<00:02:42.430> double<00:02:42.790> back<00:02:42.940> or<00:02:43.150> already<00:02:43.300> so

00:02:43.710 --> 00:02:43.720 
come with a double back or already so

00:02:43.720 --> 00:02:45.210 
come with a double back or already so
this<00:02:43.900> one<00:02:44.080> right<00:02:44.260> here<00:02:44.500> is<00:02:44.590> a<00:02:44.620> legitimate

00:02:45.210 --> 00:02:45.220 
this one right here is a legitimate

00:02:45.220 --> 00:02:47.070 
this one right here is a legitimate
double<00:02:45.550> backer<00:02:45.760> it's<00:02:46.150> not<00:02:46.330> two<00:02:46.510> cards<00:02:46.840> taped

00:02:47.070 --> 00:02:47.080 
double backer it's not two cards taped

00:02:47.080 --> 00:02:49.410 
double backer it's not two cards taped
together<00:02:47.260> and<00:02:48.160> sometimes<00:02:48.490> you'll<00:02:49.180> have<00:02:49.360> a

00:02:49.410 --> 00:02:49.420 
together and sometimes you'll have a

00:02:49.420 --> 00:02:50.910 
together and sometimes you'll have a
deck<00:02:49.720> that<00:02:49.750> actually<00:02:50.260> comes<00:02:50.470> with<00:02:50.560> that<00:02:50.740> and

00:02:50.910 --> 00:02:50.920 
deck that actually comes with that and

people worry about these double backers

00:04:03.370 --> 00:04:04.949 
people worry about these double backers
because<00:04:03.670> they<00:04:03.790> think<00:04:03.850> it's<00:04:04.150> the<00:04:04.570> spectator

00:04:08.490 --> 00:04:08.500 
you just show the spectator the cards

00:04:08.500 --> 00:04:10.260 
you just show the spectator the cards
just<00:04:08.739> don't<00:04:09.040> get<00:04:09.160> all<00:04:09.370> the<00:04:09.520> way<00:04:09.610> to<00:04:09.640> the<00:04:09.910> end<00:04:10.090> or
