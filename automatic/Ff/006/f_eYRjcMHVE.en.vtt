 i read a book called trasch 

00:01:00.480 --> 00:01:04.110
 I did not have that so I leave the book

 immediately and fell in love with me 

00:01:04.110 --> 00:01:08.610
 possibility to play in this film 

00:01:06.240 --> 00:01:10.830
 When I got the role that was too good 

00:01:08.610 --> 00:01:16.560
 to be true, and so I always feel 

00:01:10.830 --> 00:01:18.509

 that they are there but there is 

00:01:28.799 --> 00:01:32.880
 also a series of coincidences like that 

00:01:30.479 --> 00:01:34.710
 fact that martin sheen has been for many 

00:01:32.880 --> 00:01:37.079
 years of charity work on the 

00:01:34.710 --> 00:01:40.350

 mara in africa so you came already 

00:01:40.350 --> 00:01:44.450
 a lot of experience after that and that was very 

00:01:42.479 --> 00:01:46.109
 important to us you have both 

00:01:44.450 --> 00:01:56.189
 extraordinary representations 

00:01:46.109 --> 00:01:58.049

 something special from your life too 

00:01:59.729 --> 00:02:02.670
 do 

00:02:00.240 --> 00:02:04.380
 i was able to get my own experience 

00:02:02.670 --> 00:02:05.939
 my work as a volunteer helper 

00:02:04.380 --> 00:02:08.689
 in the design of the figure with 

00:02:05.939 --> 00:02:08.689
 to be included 

00:02:08.890 --> 00:02:13.730
 at my age at this time 

00:02:11.780 --> 00:02:15.620
 My career is such a lot 

00:02:13.730 --> 00:02:17.239
 Very rarely so much canvas shows 

00:02:15.620 --> 00:02:22.040
 you do not get an important movie 

00:02:17.239 --> 00:02:23.720
 more and that is an important part 

00:02:22.040 --> 00:02:26.209
 to be a movie very much 

00:02:23.720 --> 00:02:28.370
 entertaining is touching and sweet 

00:02:26.209 --> 00:02:31.040
 funny but also light at the same time 

00:02:28.370 --> 00:02:33.730
 Throws on a very important topic that 

00:02:31.040 --> 00:02:33.730
 is the biggest for me 

00:02:36.400 --> 00:02:42.440
 my motivation for this film project too 

00:02:39.379 --> 00:02:43.819
 accepting was a threefold firstly 

00:02:42.440 --> 00:02:45.140
 It was the best role for me since 

00:02:43.819 --> 00:02:46.879
 years was offered 

00:02:45.140 --> 00:02:48.950
 Second, I could handle one of the best 

00:02:46.879 --> 00:02:51.920
 directors of the world are working stephen 

00:02:48.950 --> 00:02:53.540
 daldry and thirdly, I was allowed with one 

00:02:51.920 --> 00:02:53.959
 the most charming actresses 

00:02:53.540 --> 00:02:58.420
 rotate 

00:02:53.959 --> 00:02:58.420
 rooney mara so three direct hits 

00:02:58.920 --> 00:03:04.130
 go through so much why do they have it 

00:03:01.740 --> 00:03:06.740
 do not simply much 

00:03:04.130 --> 00:03:10.459
 as you have said right, trasch 

00:03:06.740 --> 00:03:14.450
 from 18 june in the cinema 

00:03:10.459 --> 00:03:14.450

00:03:24.140 --> 00:03:27.620
 I work 

00:03:44.450 --> 00:03:51.170
 no matter who tighten the letter 

00:03:47.720 --> 00:03:51.170
 he is killed 

00:03:52.519 --> 00:03:59.760
 i know what it does corruption and 

00:03:57.930 --> 00:04:00.420
 Injustice is always money 

00:03:59.760 --> 00:04:04.790
 in the game 

00:04:00.420 --> 00:04:04.790
 what are we doing now looking for the money 

00:04:09.450 --> 00:04:14.590
 What's new of the guys 

00:04:12.340 --> 00:04:17.370
 probably already totally shitty 

00:04:14.590 --> 00:04:17.370
 garbage dump space 

00:04:23.990 --> 00:04:31.160
 why all this 

00:04:25.680 --> 00:04:31.160
 why are you doing that because it's right 

00:04:42.810 --> 00:04:47.870
 Do we really want to do it cool? 

00:04:44.790 --> 00:04:47.870
 made revolution 

00:04:52.269 --> 00:04:59.200
 they went through so much 

00:04:55.920 --> 00:05:02.370
 but they never gave up 

00:04:59.200 --> 00:05:02.370
 because it is right
