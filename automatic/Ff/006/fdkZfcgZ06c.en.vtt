00:00:43.880 --> 00:00:43.890 
back end up then my pipe won't hit right

00:00:43.890 --> 00:00:48.979 
back end up then my pipe won't hit right
here<00:00:44.239> which<00:00:45.239> is<00:00:45.770> it<00:00:46.770> won't<00:00:47.010> hit<00:00:47.190> on<00:00:47.399> this<00:00:47.989> and

00:00:48.979 --> 00:00:48.989 
here which is it won't hit on this and

00:00:48.989 --> 00:00:50.950 
here which is it won't hit on this and
this<00:00:49.140> is<00:00:49.200> a<00:00:49.350> the<00:00:49.710> best<00:00:49.920> pipe<00:00:50.129> I<00:00:50.309> found<00:00:50.610> for<00:00:50.820> my

00:00:50.950 --> 00:00:50.960 
this is a the best pipe I found for my

00:00:50.960 --> 00:00:54.560 
this is a the best pipe I found for my

00:01:46.210 --> 00:01:46.220 

00:01:46.220 --> 00:01:48.710

00:01:48.710 --> 00:01:48.720 
don't know it's not focusing there you

00:01:48.720 --> 00:01:52.609 
don't know it's not focusing there you
shouldn't<00:01:48.960> focus<00:01:50.869> there<00:01:51.869> we<00:01:51.930> go<00:01:52.049> we<00:01:52.409> got<00:01:52.500> to

00:01:52.609 --> 00:01:52.619 
shouldn't focus there we go we got to

00:01:52.619 --> 00:01:54.889 
shouldn't focus there we go we got to
focus<00:01:52.770> then<00:01:53.700> what<00:01:53.909> I<00:01:53.970> figured<00:01:54.240> out<00:01:54.360> was<00:01:54.420> I'm

00:01:54.889 --> 00:01:54.899 
focus then what I figured out was I'm

00:01:54.899 --> 00:01:58.789 
focus then what I figured out was I'm
not<00:01:55.320> getting<00:01:55.680> my<00:01:55.770> top<00:01:56.009> speed<00:01:57.380> so<00:01:58.380> I<00:01:58.409> start<00:01:58.770> to

00:01:58.789 --> 00:01:58.799 
not getting my top speed so I start to

00:01:58.799 --> 00:02:04.969 
not getting my top speed so I start to
do<00:01:58.979> a<00:01:59.009> little<00:01:59.159> a<00:01:59.430> little<00:02:03.799> research<00:02:04.799> on

00:02:04.969 --> 00:02:04.979 
do a little a little research on

00:02:04.979 --> 00:02:07.850 
do a little a little research on
throttles<00:02:05.659> and<00:02:06.659> what<00:02:07.110> I've<00:02:07.229> been<00:02:07.259> doing<00:02:07.590> is

00:02:07.850 --> 00:02:07.860 
throttles and what I've been doing is

00:02:07.860 --> 00:02:10.400 
throttles and what I've been doing is
I've<00:02:08.069> been<00:02:08.250> using<00:02:08.750> the<00:02:09.750> regular<00:02:09.899> throttle

00:02:10.400 --> 00:02:10.410 
I've been using the regular throttle

00:02:10.410 --> 00:02:13.410 
I've been using the regular throttle
cable<00:02:11.209> with<00:02:12.209> the<00:02:12.330> 20<00:02:12.599> millimeter

00:02:13.410 --> 00:02:13.420 
cable with the 20 millimeter

00:02:13.420 --> 00:02:19.309 
cable with the 20 millimeter
Carr<00:02:13.750> the<00:02:14.110> original<00:02:15.010> card<00:02:15.370> is<00:02:15.670> 14<00:02:16.210> millimeters

00:02:19.309 --> 00:02:19.319 

00:02:19.319 --> 00:02:24.920 

so<00:02:20.319> what<00:02:20.500> I<00:02:20.530> did<00:02:20.800> was<00:02:20.980> I<00:02:21.130> went<00:02:21.310> to<00:02:21.760> promotion

00:02:24.920 --> 00:02:24.930 

00:02:24.930 --> 00:02:29.730 

believe<00:02:25.930> it's<00:02:26.050> promotion<00:02:27.750> and<00:02:28.750> they<00:02:29.200> have<00:02:29.440> a

00:02:29.730 --> 00:02:29.740 
believe it's promotion and they have a

00:02:29.740 --> 00:02:37.530 
believe it's promotion and they have a
turbo<00:02:32.940> throttle<00:02:34.530> that<00:02:35.530> works<00:02:36.209> for<00:02:37.209> twenty

00:02:37.530 --> 00:02:37.540 
turbo throttle that works for twenty

00:02:39.070 --> 00:02:43.170 
eight to thirty four millimeter carb
they<00:02:39.970> also<00:02:40.150> have<00:02:40.510> a<00:02:41.640> vortex<00:02:42.640> throttle<00:02:43.060> that

00:02:43.170 --> 00:02:43.180 
they also have a vortex throttle that

00:02:43.180 --> 00:02:45.210 
they also have a vortex throttle that
works<00:02:43.420> for<00:02:43.630> a<00:02:43.690> larger<00:02:44.110> one<00:02:44.260> and<00:02:44.830> I'm<00:02:44.920> thinking

00:02:45.210 --> 00:02:45.220 
works for a larger one and I'm thinking

00:02:45.220 --> 00:02:47.070 
works for a larger one and I'm thinking
wait<00:02:45.370> a<00:02:45.430> minute<00:02:45.670> this<00:02:46.120> whole<00:02:46.450> setup<00:02:46.870> is

00:02:47.070 --> 00:02:47.080 
wait a minute this whole setup is

00:02:47.080 --> 00:02:48.240 
wait a minute this whole setup is
designed<00:02:47.470> for<00:02:47.680> a<00:02:47.739> fourteen<00:02:48.220> millimeter

00:02:48.240 --> 00:02:48.250 
designed for a fourteen millimeter

00:02:48.250 --> 00:02:51.660 
designed for a fourteen millimeter
carburetor<00:02:49.150> and<00:02:49.590> I<00:02:50.590> may<00:02:50.800> not<00:02:50.950> be<00:02:51.010> getting<00:02:51.340> the

00:02:51.660 --> 00:02:51.670 
carburetor and I may not be getting the

00:02:51.670 --> 00:02:58.250 
carburetor and I may not be getting the
carburetor<00:02:52.150> all<00:02:52.450> the<00:02:52.750> way<00:02:52.900> open<00:02:53.910> because<00:02:56.910> the

00:02:58.250 --> 00:02:58.260 
carburetor all the way open because the

00:02:58.260 --> 00:03:00.930 
carburetor all the way open because the
this<00:02:59.260> is<00:02:59.440> such<00:02:59.620> a<00:02:59.650> bigger<00:02:59.980> carburetor<00:03:00.519> and<00:03:00.820> the

00:03:00.930 --> 00:03:00.940 
this is such a bigger carburetor and the

00:03:00.940 --> 00:03:04.710 
this is such a bigger carburetor and the
slide<00:03:01.209> is<00:03:01.450> bigger<00:03:01.690> on<00:03:01.930> it<00:03:03.330> so<00:03:04.330> I'm<00:03:04.510> learning

00:03:04.710 --> 00:03:04.720 
slide is bigger on it so I'm learning

00:03:04.720 --> 00:03:06.270 
slide is bigger on it so I'm learning
something<00:03:05.080> new<00:03:05.200> all<00:03:05.440> the<00:03:05.470> time<00:03:05.800> now<00:03:06.100> I<00:03:06.130> don't

00:03:06.270 --> 00:03:06.280 
something new all the time now I don't

00:03:06.280 --> 00:03:08.610 
something new all the time now I don't
know<00:03:06.489> it<00:03:06.610> all<00:03:06.760> but<00:03:07.630> I<00:03:07.690> like<00:03:07.930> having<00:03:08.080> fun<00:03:08.440> and

00:03:10.440 --> 00:03:10.450 
there's really no one to ask about the

00:03:10.450 --> 00:03:13.140 
there's really no one to ask about the
bike<00:03:10.630> because<00:03:11.040> no<00:03:12.040> one<00:03:12.220> in<00:03:12.370> town<00:03:12.550> has<00:03:12.790> anything
