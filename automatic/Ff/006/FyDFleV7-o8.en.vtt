00:01:28.110 --> 00:01:32.329

00:02:00.240 --> 00:02:04.200
 Ukraine policy 

00:02:01.799 --> 00:02:06.780
 FIFA should raise the question of deprivation

 workers athletes and spectators this is not 

00:02:25.900 --> 00:02:30.760

00:02:28.840 --> 00:02:32.980
 waiting for the Russian side to take it 

00:02:30.760 --> 00:02:35.650

00:02:38.890 --> 00:02:42.640
 Ukrainian government and 

00:02:40.690 --> 00:02:45.100
 opportunities to conclude with Peter Poroshenko 

00:02:42.640 --> 00:02:46.530
 contract that will allow both parties 

00:02:45.100 --> 00:02:50.290

00:02:46.530 --> 00:02:53.590
 sovereignty and independence of Ukraine and 

00:02:50.290 --> 00:02:55.390

00:03:10.860 --> 00:03:17.080
 German politicians hope that Russia 

00:03:13.900 --> 00:03:21.000
 signals of the west will hear and make efforts 

00:03:17.080 --> 00:03:21.000
