00:00:19.490 --> 00:00:19.500 
thought that's a really good way of

00:00:19.500 --> 00:00:22.160 
thought that's a really good way of
actually<00:00:19.770> judging<00:00:20.430> how<00:00:21.359> you're<00:00:21.570> going<00:00:21.750> and

00:00:22.160 --> 00:00:22.170 
actually judging how you're going and

00:00:22.170 --> 00:00:23.720 
actually judging how you're going and
how<00:00:22.680> do<00:00:22.740> you<00:00:22.859> even<00:00:22.949> know<00:00:23.070> how<00:00:23.369> you<00:00:23.430> when<00:00:23.580> to<00:00:23.640> get

00:00:23.720 --> 00:00:23.730 
how do you even know how you when to get

00:00:23.730 --> 00:00:24.980 
how do you even know how you when to get
through<00:00:23.970> stuff<00:00:24.210> unless<00:00:24.330> you<00:00:24.539> know<00:00:24.689> how<00:00:24.840> many

00:00:24.980 --> 00:00:24.990 
through stuff unless you know how many

00:00:24.990 --> 00:00:27.670 
through stuff unless you know how many
how<00:00:25.410> many<00:00:25.470> products<00:00:25.920> you<00:00:26.010> have<00:00:26.039> so<00:00:26.640> I<00:00:26.910> decided

00:00:27.670 --> 00:00:27.680 
how many products you have so I decided

00:00:27.680 --> 00:00:31.089 
how many products you have so I decided

00:00:34.260 --> 00:00:36.400 
home by myself that I would count up all
my<00:00:34.469> products<00:00:34.860> and<00:00:35.130> Tyler<00:00:35.670> them<00:00:35.880> off<00:00:35.969> and

you're<00:00:37.410> seeing<00:00:37.620> right<00:00:37.710> now<00:00:37.800> a<00:00:37.920> lot<00:00:38.219> of<00:00:38.399> blushes

00:00:38.810 --> 00:00:38.820 
you're seeing right now a lot of blushes

00:00:38.820 --> 00:00:40.369 
you're seeing right now a lot of blushes
and<00:00:39.000> they<00:00:39.180> just<00:00:39.360> kept<00:00:39.600> coming<00:00:39.690> out<00:00:40.079> of<00:00:40.110> nowhere

00:00:40.369 --> 00:00:40.379 
and they just kept coming out of nowhere

00:00:40.379 --> 00:00:42.319 
and they just kept coming out of nowhere
so<00:00:41.190> I<00:00:41.219> basically<00:00:41.550> wrote<00:00:41.910> down<00:00:42.059> all<00:00:42.120> the

00:00:42.319 --> 00:00:42.329 
so I basically wrote down all the

00:00:42.329 --> 00:00:43.639 
so I basically wrote down all the
categories<00:00:42.629> on<00:00:42.870> that<00:00:42.989> piece<00:00:43.170> of<00:00:43.200> paper<00:00:43.350> you

00:00:43.639 --> 00:00:43.649 
categories on that piece of paper you

00:00:43.649 --> 00:00:45.770 
categories on that piece of paper you
can<00:00:43.770> see<00:00:43.980> there<00:00:44.190> and<00:00:44.430> then<00:00:44.910> tallied<00:00:45.360> them<00:00:45.570> and

00:00:45.770 --> 00:00:45.780 
can see there and then tallied them and

00:00:45.780 --> 00:00:47.450 
can see there and then tallied them and
then<00:00:45.870> if<00:00:45.989> they<00:00:46.140> were<00:00:46.200> my<00:00:46.710> hologram<00:00:47.129> I<00:00:47.160> like

00:00:47.450 --> 00:00:47.460 
then if they were my hologram I like

00:00:47.460 --> 00:00:48.920 
then if they were my hologram I like
them<00:00:47.670> with<00:00:47.760> the<00:00:47.850> pink<00:00:48.090> highlighter<00:00:48.450> and<00:00:48.600> then

00:00:48.920 --> 00:00:48.930 
them with the pink highlighter and then

00:00:48.930 --> 00:00:52.189 
them with the pink highlighter and then
if<00:00:49.110> they<00:00:49.320> were<00:00:49.399> things<00:00:50.399> that<00:00:50.520> were<00:00:51.110> unopened<00:00:52.110> I

00:00:52.189 --> 00:00:52.199 
if they were things that were unopened I

00:00:52.199 --> 00:00:54.040 
if they were things that were unopened I
month<00:00:52.440> then<00:00:52.620> with<00:00:52.710> the<00:00:52.829> yellow<00:00:53.039> highlight<00:00:53.520> on

00:00:54.040 --> 00:00:54.050 
month then with the yellow highlight on

00:00:54.050 --> 00:00:56.990 
month then with the yellow highlight on
so<00:00:55.050> again<00:00:55.920> they<00:00:56.219> just<00:00:56.370> kept<00:00:56.579> humming<00:00:56.789> all

00:00:56.990 --> 00:00:57.000 
so again they just kept humming all

00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:00.500 
so again they just kept humming all
these<00:00:57.120> washes<00:00:57.440> so<00:00:58.440> it<00:00:58.949> took<00:00:59.190> me<00:00:59.460> a<00:00:59.670> quite<00:01:00.239> a<00:01:00.270> bit

00:01:00.500 --> 00:01:00.510 
these washes so it took me a quite a bit

00:01:00.510 --> 00:01:02.060 
these washes so it took me a quite a bit
of<00:01:00.629> time<00:01:00.660> to<00:01:01.109> be<00:01:01.199> honest<00:01:01.440> and<00:01:01.590> I<00:01:01.680> was<00:01:01.829> a<00:01:01.859> bit

00:01:02.060 --> 00:01:02.070 
of time to be honest and I was a bit

00:01:02.070 --> 00:01:04.850 
of time to be honest and I was a bit
shocked<00:01:02.399> just<00:01:02.670> by<00:01:02.879> that<00:01:03.090> because<00:01:03.270> I<00:01:03.860> didn't

00:01:04.850 --> 00:01:04.860 
shocked just by that because I didn't

00:01:04.860 --> 00:01:06.020 
shocked just by that because I didn't
think<00:01:04.949> it<00:01:05.070> would<00:01:05.159> take<00:01:05.189> me<00:01:05.430> like<00:01:05.460> three<00:01:06.000> hours

00:01:06.020 --> 00:01:06.030 
think it would take me like three hours

00:01:06.030 --> 00:01:08.240 
think it would take me like three hours
to<00:01:06.540> count<00:01:06.750> all<00:01:06.900> my<00:01:06.960> makeup<00:01:07.290> products<00:01:07.830> and<00:01:08.130> then

00:01:08.240 --> 00:01:08.250 
to count all my makeup products and then

00:01:08.250 --> 00:01:10.130 
to count all my makeup products and then
it<00:01:08.400> sort<00:01:08.549> of<00:01:08.640> extended<00:01:09.150> into<00:01:09.540> other

00:01:10.130 --> 00:01:10.140 
it sort of extended into other

00:01:10.140 --> 00:01:13.010 
it sort of extended into other
categories<00:01:10.380> with<00:01:10.979> randoms<00:01:11.490> and<00:01:11.729> like<00:01:12.240> not

00:01:13.010 --> 00:01:13.020 
categories with randoms and like not

00:01:13.020 --> 00:01:14.899
