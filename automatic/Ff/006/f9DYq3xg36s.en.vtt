00:00:22.040 --> 00:00:22.050 
beta mode now but my theory is if many

00:00:22.050 --> 00:00:24.200 
beta mode now but my theory is if many
people<00:00:22.140> utilize<00:00:22.859> this<00:00:23.160> and<00:00:23.400> show<00:00:23.730> the<00:00:23.880> pokemon

00:00:24.200 --> 00:00:24.210 
people utilize this and show the pokemon

00:00:24.210 --> 00:00:26.900 
people utilize this and show the pokemon
company<00:00:24.240> that<00:00:24.810> hey<00:00:25.380> guys<00:00:25.590> a<00:00:25.949> profit<00:00:26.609> could<00:00:26.730> be

00:00:26.900 --> 00:00:26.910 
company that hey guys a profit could be

00:00:26.910 --> 00:00:28.490 
company that hey guys a profit could be
made<00:00:27.060> from<00:00:27.300> this<00:00:27.449> other<00:00:27.779> than<00:00:27.990> just<00:00:28.320> selling

00:00:28.490 --> 00:00:28.500 
made from this other than just selling

00:00:28.500 --> 00:00:32.709 
made from this other than just selling
more<00:00:28.769> cards<00:00:29.300> ie<00:00:30.300> selling<00:00:30.990> games<00:00:31.260> and<00:00:31.650> cards<00:00:32.189> I

more cards ie selling games and cards I
think<00:00:33.719> it<00:00:33.809> would<00:00:33.899> encourage<00:00:34.200> them<00:00:34.410> to<00:00:34.440> make<00:00:34.680> a

definitely do that option or something

00:01:39.810 --> 00:01:42.140 
definitely do that option or something
similar<00:01:40.229> to<00:01:40.259> that<00:01:40.409> but<00:01:40.860> I<00:01:41.100> don't<00:01:41.850> know<00:01:41.939> why

00:01:42.140 --> 00:01:42.150 
similar to that but I don't know why

00:01:42.150 --> 00:01:44.690 
similar to that but I don't know why
they<00:01:42.420> wouldn't<00:01:42.689> and<00:01:42.930> I<00:01:43.799> think<00:01:44.250> since<00:01:44.520> they're

00:01:44.690 --> 00:01:44.700 
they wouldn't and I think since they're

get<00:02:05.930> into<00:02:06.080> a<00:02:06.170> match<00:02:06.380> with<00:02:06.560> him<00:02:06.680> my<00:02:07.490> only

00:02:07.630 --> 00:02:07.640 
get into a match with him my only

00:02:07.640 --> 00:02:10.150 
get into a match with him my only
recommendation<00:02:07.820> is<00:02:08.450> that<00:02:08.479> if<00:02:09.350> you<00:02:09.770> run<00:02:10.039> across

00:02:10.150 --> 00:02:10.160 
recommendation is that if you run across

00:02:10.160 --> 00:02:12.730 
recommendation is that if you run across
him<00:02:10.369> with<00:02:10.789> a<00:02:10.820> fire<00:02:11.180> deck<00:02:11.540> which<00:02:12.320> you<00:02:12.500> could

00:02:12.730 --> 00:02:12.740 
him with a fire deck which you could

00:02:12.740 --> 00:02:15.400 
him with a fire deck which you could
because<00:02:13.220> if<00:02:13.550> you<00:02:14.300> don't<00:02:14.450> have<00:02:14.720> any<00:02:14.870> special

00:02:15.400 --> 00:02:15.410 
because if you don't have any special

00:02:15.410 --> 00:02:18.310 
because if you don't have any special

00:02:22.900 --> 00:02:22.910 
Trading Card simulator instead what it

00:02:22.910 --> 00:02:25.840 
Trading Card simulator instead what it
does<00:02:23.360> is<00:02:23.690> it<00:02:23.750> hands<00:02:24.500> you<00:02:24.770> three<00:02:25.250> separate

00:02:25.840 --> 00:02:25.850 
does is it hands you three separate

00:02:39.220 --> 00:02:39.230 
this series I'll be running those out

00:02:39.230 --> 00:02:41.949 
this series I'll be running those out
and<00:02:39.560> giving<00:02:40.130> them<00:02:40.250> a<00:02:40.280> try<00:02:40.580> seeing<00:02:41.420> if<00:02:41.570> they<00:02:41.780> run

00:02:41.949 --> 00:02:41.959 
and giving them a try seeing if they run

00:02:41.959 --> 00:02:43.660 
and giving them a try seeing if they run
any<00:02:42.170> more<00:02:42.350> effectively<00:02:42.830> than<00:02:42.980> the<00:02:43.280> decks<00:02:43.489> that

00:02:43.660 --> 00:02:43.670 
any more effectively than the decks that

00:02:43.670 --> 00:02:45.430 
any more effectively than the decks that
you<00:02:43.760> had<00:02:43.910> to<00:02:44.000> scan<00:02:44.239> and<00:02:44.390> do<00:02:44.570> augmented<00:02:45.020> reality

00:02:45.430 --> 00:02:45.440 
you had to scan and do augmented reality

00:02:45.440 --> 00:02:47.680 
you had to scan and do augmented reality
or<00:02:45.560> not<00:02:45.709> but<00:02:46.520> yeah<00:02:47.180> if<00:02:47.270> you've<00:02:47.450> got<00:02:47.660> a

the Pokemon is knocked out and of course

00:03:25.459 --> 00:03:27.910 
the Pokemon is knocked out and of course
just<00:03:25.519> like<00:03:25.910> in<00:03:26.120> the<00:03:26.239> video<00:03:26.330> game<00:03:26.510> that<00:03:27.260> people

00:03:27.910 --> 00:03:27.920 
just like in the video game that people

00:03:27.920 --> 00:03:30.400 
just like in the video game that people
have<00:03:28.280> of<00:03:28.640> course<00:03:29.030> on<00:03:29.329> this<00:03:29.480> channel<00:03:29.720> most

00:03:30.400 --> 00:03:30.410 
have of course on this channel most

00:03:30.410 --> 00:03:33.130 
have of course on this channel most
likely<00:03:30.709> gotten<00:03:31.130> used<00:03:31.280> to<00:03:31.690> status<00:03:32.690> abilities

like<00:03:33.170> paralyzation<00:03:33.860> and<00:03:34.250> poison<00:03:34.760> and<00:03:34.910> sleep

00:03:35.170 --> 00:03:35.180 
like paralyzation and poison and sleep

00:03:35.180 --> 00:03:37.030 
like paralyzation and poison and sleep
they<00:03:35.750> do<00:03:35.810> affect<00:03:36.079> the<00:03:36.320> card<00:03:36.590> game<00:03:36.769> but

00:03:37.030 --> 00:03:37.040 
they do affect the card game but

00:03:37.040 --> 00:03:40.690 
they do affect the card game but
somewhat<00:03:37.880> differently<00:03:39.130> you<00:03:40.130> know<00:03:40.160> there<00:03:40.549> you

00:03:40.690 --> 00:03:40.700 
somewhat differently you know there you

00:03:40.700 --> 00:03:43.509 
somewhat differently you know there you
just<00:03:40.910> saw<00:03:41.090> resistance<00:03:42.049> mechanics<00:03:43.010> working<00:03:43.250> in

00:03:43.509 --> 00:03:43.519 
just saw resistance mechanics working in

and something i want to add because this
match<00:03:56.110> is<00:03:56.140> actually<00:03:56.620> wrapping<00:03:56.920> up<00:03:57.040> quicker

00:03:57.480 --> 00:03:57.490 
match is actually wrapping up quicker

00:03:57.490 --> 00:04:00.450 
match is actually wrapping up quicker
than<00:03:57.730> i<00:03:57.850> expected<00:03:57.970> is<00:03:58.770> you'll<00:03:59.770> see<00:04:00.040> me<00:04:00.190> here

00:04:43.800 --> 00:04:43.810 
one of the cards I would definitely

00:04:43.810 --> 00:04:45.660 
one of the cards I would definitely
recommend<00:04:44.050> adding<00:04:44.650> to<00:04:44.920> this<00:04:45.040> deck<00:04:45.340> would

00:04:45.660 --> 00:04:45.670 
recommend adding to this deck would

00:04:45.670 --> 00:04:47.690 
recommend adding to this deck would
maybe<00:04:45.910> be<00:04:46.240> something<00:04:46.900> of<00:04:46.990> a<00:04:47.110> Venn<00:04:47.290> effete

00:04:47.690 --> 00:04:47.700 
maybe be something of a Venn effete

00:04:47.700 --> 00:04:53.100 
maybe be something of a Venn effete
maybe<00:04:48.700> a<00:04:48.820> sawsbuck<00:04:50.340> but<00:04:51.340> I<00:04:52.000> don't<00:04:52.450> believe<00:04:52.570> it

00:04:53.100 --> 00:04:53.110 
maybe a sawsbuck but I don't believe it

00:04:53.110 --> 00:04:55.730 
maybe a sawsbuck but I don't believe it
lets<00:04:53.320> you<00:04:53.470> edit<00:04:53.620> any<00:04:53.920> of<00:04:54.010> the<00:04:54.130> cards<00:04:54.520> that

00:04:55.730 --> 00:04:55.740 
lets you edit any of the cards that

00:04:55.740 --> 00:04:59.310 
lets you edit any of the cards that
would<00:04:56.740> be<00:04:56.890> a<00:04:56.920> cool<00:04:57.250> feature<00:04:57.610> especially<00:04:58.510> later

00:04:59.310 --> 00:04:59.320 
would be a cool feature especially later

00:04:59.320 --> 00:05:01.140 
would be a cool feature especially later
down<00:04:59.560> the<00:04:59.590> line<00:04:59.770> when<00:05:00.160> most<00:05:00.430> people<00:05:00.790> know<00:05:00.970> how

00:05:01.140 --> 00:05:01.150 
down the line when most people know how

00:05:01.150 --> 00:05:03.570 
down the line when most people know how
to<00:05:01.210> play<00:05:01.750> pokemon<00:05:02.290> they<00:05:03.010> can<00:05:03.190> start<00:05:03.460> to

00:05:03.570 --> 00:05:03.580 
to play pokemon they can start to

00:05:03.580 --> 00:05:05.370 
to play pokemon they can start to
foresee<00:05:04.030> their<00:05:04.240> own<00:05:04.390> strategies<00:05:05.020> and<00:05:05.260> what

00:05:05.370 --> 00:05:05.380 
foresee their own strategies and what

00:05:05.380 --> 00:05:08.100 
foresee their own strategies and what
cards<00:05:05.740> they'd<00:05:05.920> want<00:05:06.130> to<00:05:06.220> use<00:05:06.750> that<00:05:07.750> happened

00:05:08.100 --> 00:05:08.110 
cards they'd want to use that happened

00:05:08.110 --> 00:05:09.810 
cards they'd want to use that happened
to<00:05:08.200> me<00:05:08.350> immediately<00:05:08.680> once<00:05:09.160> i<00:05:09.280> started<00:05:09.610> using

00:05:09.810 --> 00:05:09.820 
to me immediately once i started using

00:05:09.820 --> 00:05:12.270 
to me immediately once i started using
the<00:05:10.000> simulator<00:05:10.270> again<00:05:11.070> formulas<00:05:12.070> and

00:05:12.270 --> 00:05:12.280 
the simulator again formulas and

00:05:12.280 --> 00:05:14.840 
the simulator again formulas and
strategies<00:05:12.760> to<00:05:13.030> start<00:05:13.390> flowing<00:05:13.930> into<00:05:14.080> my<00:05:14.290> head

00:05:14.840 --> 00:05:14.850 
strategies to start flowing into my head

00:05:14.850 --> 00:05:17.910 
strategies to start flowing into my head
so<00:05:15.850> that<00:05:16.120> was<00:05:16.510> this<00:05:16.870> match<00:05:17.080> and<00:05:17.380> i'll<00:05:17.500> see<00:05:17.800> you

00:05:17.910 --> 00:05:17.920 
so that was this match and i'll see you

00:05:17.920 --> 00:05:22.890 
so that was this match and i'll see you
guys<00:05:17.980> next<00:05:18.640> time<00:05:18.940> on<00:05:19.630> the<00:05:19.690> TCG<00:05:20.350> simulator
