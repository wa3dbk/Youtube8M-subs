to help me with I'm going to come here
why<00:02:03.820> not<00:02:04.000> make<00:02:04.360> these<00:02:04.660> recreate<00:02:05.530> these<00:02:05.830> as

00:02:06.260 --> 00:02:06.270 
why not make these recreate these as

00:02:06.270 --> 00:02:10.340 
why not make these recreate these as
best<00:02:07.270> we<00:02:07.360> can<00:02:07.660> in<00:02:08.080> a<00:02:08.290> historical<00:02:08.890> way<00:02:09.010> but<00:02:09.670> then

00:02:10.340 --> 00:02:10.350 
best we can in a historical way but then

00:02:10.350 --> 00:02:12.840 
best we can in a historical way but then
redevelop<00:02:11.350> them<00:02:11.530> for<00:02:11.890> an<00:02:12.010> installation<00:02:12.430> I'll

00:02:12.840 --> 00:02:12.850 
redevelop them for an installation I'll

00:02:12.850 --> 00:02:15.449 
redevelop them for an installation I'll
do<00:02:13.000> later<00:02:13.530> well<00:02:14.530> the<00:02:14.620> show<00:02:14.770> gloves<00:02:15.070> are<00:02:15.280> just

00:02:15.449 --> 00:02:15.459 
do later well the show gloves are just

00:02:15.459 --> 00:02:17.160 
do later well the show gloves are just
the<00:02:15.580> first<00:02:15.760> part<00:02:16.060> of<00:02:16.209> this<00:02:16.330> project<00:02:16.600> the<00:02:16.989> show

00:02:17.160 --> 00:02:17.170 
the first part of this project the show

00:02:17.170 --> 00:02:20.699 
the first part of this project the show
gloves<00:02:17.640> are<00:02:18.640> historically<00:02:19.239> are<00:02:19.690> based<00:02:20.470> on

00:02:20.699 --> 00:02:20.709 
gloves are historically are based on

00:02:20.709 --> 00:02:24.360 
gloves are historically are based on
alchemical<00:02:22.380> chemical<00:02:23.380> laboratory<00:02:24.010> equipment

00:02:24.360 --> 00:02:24.370 
alchemical chemical laboratory equipment

00:02:24.370 --> 00:02:26.970 
alchemical chemical laboratory equipment
and<00:02:24.730> they<00:02:25.390> sort<00:02:25.600> of<00:02:25.690> morph<00:02:25.989> from<00:02:26.500> the

00:02:26.970 --> 00:02:26.980 
and they sort of morph from the

00:02:26.980 --> 00:02:29.910 
and they sort of morph from the
alchemical<00:02:27.730> to<00:02:28.390> the<00:02:28.780> show<00:02:28.989> globe<00:02:29.290> so<00:02:29.770> I'm

00:02:29.910 --> 00:02:29.920 
alchemical to the show globe so I'm

00:02:29.920 --> 00:02:31.560 
alchemical to the show globe so I'm
going<00:02:30.220> backwards<00:02:30.489> I'm<00:02:30.970> going<00:02:31.000> to<00:02:31.120> start<00:02:31.420> with

00:02:31.560 --> 00:02:31.570 
going backwards I'm going to start with

00:02:31.570 --> 00:02:33.090 
going backwards I'm going to start with
show<00:02:31.780> gloves<00:02:32.110> and<00:02:32.380> then<00:02:32.680> we're<00:02:32.800> gonna<00:02:32.890> go

00:02:33.090 --> 00:02:33.100 
show gloves and then we're gonna go

00:02:33.100 --> 00:02:34.979 
show gloves and then we're gonna go
backwards<00:02:33.400> and<00:02:33.880> work<00:02:34.030> without<00:02:34.480> chemical

00:02:34.979 --> 00:02:34.989 
backwards and work without chemical

00:02:34.989 --> 00:02:37.080 
backwards and work without chemical
forms<00:02:35.410> and<00:02:35.620> then<00:02:36.070> go<00:02:36.280> back<00:02:36.520> to<00:02:36.730> dealing<00:02:36.910> with

00:02:37.080 --> 00:02:37.090 
forms and then go back to dealing with

00:02:37.090 --> 00:02:40.170 
forms and then go back to dealing with
what<00:02:37.750> were<00:02:37.930> alchemical<00:02:38.770> bottles<00:02:39.520> used<00:02:39.850> for

00:02:40.170 --> 00:02:40.180 
what were alchemical bottles used for

00:02:40.180 --> 00:02:44.300 
what were alchemical bottles used for
which<00:02:40.750> were<00:02:40.900> basically<00:02:41.320> a<00:02:41.950> way<00:02:42.760> to<00:02:42.820> recreate

00:02:44.300 --> 00:02:44.310 
which were basically a way to recreate

00:02:44.310 --> 00:02:49.440 
which were basically a way to recreate
spiritual<00:02:45.310> and<00:02:45.700> physical<00:02:47.070> material<00:02:48.070> and

spiritual and physical material and

00:02:49.450 --> 00:02:52.170 
spiritual and physical material and
in<00:02:49.510> the<00:02:49.720> end<00:02:49.870> goal<00:02:50.170> of<00:02:50.530> creating<00:02:51.400> human<00:02:52.000> life
