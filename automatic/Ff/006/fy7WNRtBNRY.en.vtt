00:00:00.709 --> 00:00:12.350
 rechtsrheinisch time after time is your 

00:00:10.139 --> 00:00:15.430
 way 

00:00:12.350 --> 00:00:15.430
 the world 

00:00:16.820 --> 00:00:20.790
 I somehow feel that all 

00:00:19.080 --> 00:00:23.100
 others are constantly on the move here 

00:00:20.790 --> 00:00:25.290
 math for example and you too marco you 

00:00:23.100 --> 00:00:27.750
 you played dark souls at one 

00:00:25.290 --> 00:00:30.869
 Event that was exactly what happened in the castle hotel 

00:00:27.750 --> 00:00:32.579
 kronberg frankfurt location pretty good 

00:00:30.869 --> 00:00:35.310
 fit to the game because as I said one 

00:00:32.579 --> 00:00:37.710
 old castle hotel i could and there 

00:00:35.310 --> 00:00:39.030
 We then spend several hours by the 

00:00:37.710 --> 00:00:45.480
 singles campaign a bit pure 

00:00:39.030 --> 00:00:48.570
 So yes, so it is in the play 

00:00:45.480 --> 00:00:50.850
 Up front, the dark souls were two very 

00:00:48.570 --> 00:00:54.030
 will be much nicer than dark souls 

00:00:50.850 --> 00:00:55.560
 but you look at it I think 

00:00:54.030 --> 00:00:56.490
 I do not find it so empty now 

00:00:55.560 --> 00:00:59.610
 huge difference 

00:00:56.490 --> 00:01:01.230
 even the monster sounds in recycled 

00:00:59.610 --> 00:01:03.530
 I think of these rats 

00:01:01.230 --> 00:01:06.030
 zombies or what this is supposed to be 

00:01:03.530 --> 00:01:08.280
 right at this weird monster below 

00:01:06.030 --> 00:01:10.590
 because you notice a bit was 

00:01:08.280 --> 00:01:12.360
 but operated on the whole 

00:01:10.590 --> 00:01:14.549
 has a bit of the software already 

00:01:12.360 --> 00:01:17.850
 put into words and many new content 

00:01:14.549 --> 00:01:20.220
 but creates what graphic you graphic 

00:01:17.850 --> 00:01:22.590
 He was right there was soft 

00:01:20.220 --> 00:01:25.920
 never turn away so great it is 

00:01:22.590 --> 00:01:27.320
 still up to 3 xbox 360 so you have to 

00:01:25.920 --> 00:01:30.750
 not surprised 

00:01:27.320 --> 00:01:32.190
 that's the gameplay when you look at yourself 

00:01:30.750 --> 00:01:34.140
 now everyone looks at the dax 

00:01:32.190 --> 00:01:36.150
 has played songs knows who 

00:01:34.140 --> 00:01:39.770
 again in the fight against a huge one 

00:01:36.150 --> 00:01:42.030
 opponents mercilessly beats up a 

00:01:39.770 --> 00:01:43.680
 and you have seen that too 

00:01:42.030 --> 00:01:46.350
 resume counting 

00:01:43.680 --> 00:01:48.600
 works right at the beginning and the 

00:01:46.350 --> 00:01:50.010
 estos flakons and also back but it 

00:01:48.600 --> 00:01:53.700
 also gives this other highlight 

00:01:50.010 --> 00:01:55.979
 that this ball is constantly holding the 

00:01:53.700 --> 00:01:56.729
 It was already in the first part is so one 

00:01:55.979 --> 00:01:58.860
 dimension 

00:01:56.729 --> 00:02:00.960
 you can look at various behind 

00:01:58.860 --> 00:02:03.630
 Buy again and just start 

00:02:00.960 --> 00:02:05.549
 that the sqs flakon there we have it only 

00:02:03.630 --> 00:02:07.440
 Once every day you have to 

00:02:05.549 --> 00:02:08.670
 back to bonfire so go to the fire 

00:02:07.440 --> 00:02:10.619
 to recharge ourselves 

00:02:08.670 --> 00:02:12.870
 So at the beginning of the game because this 

00:02:10.619 --> 00:02:14.360
 Items you buy must be very 

00:02:12.870 --> 00:02:24.210
 important 

00:02:14.360 --> 00:02:26.190
 But hobby also atmospheric 

00:02:24.210 --> 00:02:28.140
 makes that really fun again 

00:02:26.190 --> 00:02:30.930
 on dark souls two because i like to stop 

00:02:28.140 --> 00:02:32.910
 those little cryptic people there 

00:02:30.930 --> 00:02:35.070
 sitting around and chattering about things 

00:02:32.910 --> 00:02:39.450
 which one first understands me with her 

00:02:35.070 --> 00:02:41.010
 Old English dialect and otherwise yes 

00:02:39.450 --> 00:02:44.880
 Personally, it does not bother me that way 

00:02:41.010 --> 00:02:46.590
 that it does not look quite as nice as 

00:02:44.880 --> 00:02:48.120
 some other role play because stop 

00:02:46.590 --> 00:02:51.090
 this game experience just like that 

00:02:48.120 --> 00:02:53.370
 unique is this exactly know that 

00:02:51.090 --> 00:02:54.000
 one used by each opponent neck around 

00:02:53.370 --> 00:02:56.520
 can be 

00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:58.170
 the graphic is in the same way 

00:02:56.520 --> 00:03:02.370
 really play second or even 

00:02:58.170 --> 00:03:03.930
 third so the crm system where you 

00:03:02.370 --> 00:03:05.910
 again strongly incorporated in 

00:03:03.930 --> 00:03:07.530
 as you can see here two normal 

00:03:05.910 --> 00:03:09.300
 his opponent if you look stupid 

00:03:07.530 --> 00:03:11.330
 they can be very fast too 

00:03:09.300 --> 00:03:13.380
 got to 

00:03:11.330 --> 00:03:16.860
 is not too long now 

00:03:13.380 --> 00:03:18.540
 dark souls appear 2 and I guess 

00:03:16.860 --> 00:03:20.160
 that knows the last preview before 

00:03:18.540 --> 00:03:23.100
 We then have the test and I am pleased 

00:03:20.160 --> 00:03:26.330
 beast on me and I think you 

00:03:23.100 --> 00:03:26.330
 yes, I too high
