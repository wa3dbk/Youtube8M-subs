doing a deck profile for the car to
clearwater<00:00:04.560> in<00:00:04.620> the<00:00:04.770> sectors<00:00:05.100> that<00:00:05.130> i<00:00:05.250> was

00:00:05.329 --> 00:00:05.339 
clearwater in the sectors that i was

00:00:05.339 --> 00:00:06.650 
clearwater in the sectors that i was
playing<00:00:05.520> a<00:00:05.580> few<00:00:05.700> days<00:00:05.819> ago<00:00:06.000> I've<00:00:06.359> been<00:00:06.450> doing<00:00:06.509> a

00:00:06.650 --> 00:00:06.660 
playing a few days ago I've been doing a

00:00:06.660 --> 00:00:07.970 
playing a few days ago I've been doing a
little<00:00:06.720> bit<00:00:06.899> more<00:00:06.990> testing<00:00:07.410> and<00:00:07.589> I'm<00:00:07.740> pretty

00:00:07.970 --> 00:00:07.980 
little bit more testing and I'm pretty

00:00:07.980 --> 00:00:10.100 
little bit more testing and I'm pretty
satisfied<00:00:08.189> with<00:00:08.580> this<00:00:08.730> build<00:00:09.030> I've<00:00:09.990> been

00:00:10.100 --> 00:00:10.110 
satisfied with this build I've been

00:00:10.110 --> 00:00:12.350 
satisfied with this build I've been
testing<00:00:10.679> it<00:00:10.740> out<00:00:10.860> and<00:00:11.070> definitely<00:00:12.059> it<00:00:12.240> has

00:00:12.350 --> 00:00:12.360 
testing it out and definitely it has

00:00:12.360 --> 00:00:14.180 
testing it out and definitely it has
some<00:00:12.540> potential<00:00:12.809> I<00:00:13.080> doubt<00:00:13.710> it's<00:00:13.920> going<00:00:14.009> to<00:00:14.099> get

00:00:14.180 --> 00:00:14.190 
some potential I doubt it's going to get

00:00:14.190 --> 00:00:16.849 
some potential I doubt it's going to get
hit<00:00:14.340> yeah<00:00:14.910> next<00:00:15.330> damla<00:00:16.139> so<00:00:16.379> I<00:00:16.410> think<00:00:16.619> you'll<00:00:16.800> be

00:00:16.849 --> 00:00:16.859 
hit yeah next damla so I think you'll be

00:00:16.859 --> 00:00:19.099 
hit yeah next damla so I think you'll be
okay<00:00:17.100> to<00:00:17.160> run<00:00:17.340> this<00:00:17.520> even<00:00:18.420> though<00:00:18.480> in<00:00:18.600> TCG<00:00:18.990> it

00:00:19.099 --> 00:00:19.109 
okay to run this even though in TCG it

00:00:19.109 --> 00:00:20.510 
okay to run this even though in TCG it
still<00:00:19.320> has<00:00:19.439> top<00:00:19.650> and<00:00:19.800> the<00:00:19.859> ocg<00:00:20.189> I<00:00:20.220> don't<00:00:20.400> think

00:00:20.510 --> 00:00:20.520 
still has top and the ocg I don't think

00:00:20.520 --> 00:00:21.769 
still has top and the ocg I don't think
they<00:00:20.580> even<00:00:20.609> care<00:00:20.939> about<00:00:21.000> in<00:00:21.180> sectors<00:00:21.449> anymore

00:00:21.769 --> 00:00:21.779 
they even care about in sectors anymore

00:00:21.779 --> 00:00:23.480 
they even care about in sectors anymore
they<00:00:22.080> loved<00:00:22.380> in<00:00:22.529> sectors<00:00:22.830> before<00:00:23.160> though<00:00:23.310> when

00:00:23.480 --> 00:00:23.490 
they loved in sectors before though when

00:00:23.490 --> 00:00:25.340 
they loved in sectors before though when
a<00:00:23.519> Hornet<00:00:23.850> and<00:00:23.970> dragonfly<00:00:24.539> we're<00:00:24.960> at<00:00:25.080> three

00:00:25.340 --> 00:00:25.350 
a Hornet and dragonfly we're at three

00:00:25.350 --> 00:00:27.200 
a Hornet and dragonfly we're at three
but<00:00:25.800> yeah<00:00:25.980> it's<00:00:26.160> a<00:00:26.279> pretty<00:00:26.640> good<00:00:26.849> deck<00:00:27.000> i<00:00:27.090> would

00:00:27.200 --> 00:00:27.210 
but yeah it's a pretty good deck i would

00:00:27.210 --> 00:00:28.790 
but yeah it's a pretty good deck i would
say<00:00:27.390> and<00:00:27.570> it's<00:00:27.900> relatively<00:00:28.199> inexpensive

00:00:28.790 --> 00:00:28.800 
say and it's relatively inexpensive

00:00:28.800 --> 00:00:31.070 
say and it's relatively inexpensive
minus<00:00:29.039> BLS<00:00:29.460> but<00:00:29.880> you<00:00:29.970> can<00:00:30.119> definitely<00:00:30.330> opt<00:00:30.840> out

00:00:31.070 --> 00:00:31.080 
minus BLS but you can definitely opt out

00:00:31.080 --> 00:00:33.860 
minus BLS but you can definitely opt out
to<00:00:31.470> play<00:00:31.619> chaos<00:00:32.130> or<00:00:32.279> four<00:00:32.430> instead<00:00:32.610> of<00:00:32.669> BLS<00:00:33.000> but

00:00:33.860 --> 00:00:33.870 
to play chaos or four instead of BLS but

00:00:33.870 --> 00:00:36.049 
to play chaos or four instead of BLS but
SS<00:00:34.260> is<00:00:34.350> pretty<00:00:34.559> good<00:00:34.739> but<00:00:35.340> let's<00:00:35.730> get<00:00:35.910> start

00:00:36.049 --> 00:00:36.059 
SS is pretty good but let's get start

00:00:36.059 --> 00:00:37.010 
SS is pretty good but let's get start
with<00:00:36.149> the<00:00:36.210> back<00:00:36.300> plan<00:00:36.540> i'll<00:00:36.719> explain<00:00:36.899> my

00:00:37.010 --> 00:00:37.020 
with the back plan i'll explain my

00:00:37.020 --> 00:00:38.750 
with the back plan i'll explain my
choices<00:00:37.230> as<00:00:37.469> we<00:00:37.739> go<00:00:37.860> along<00:00:37.950> so<00:00:38.340> I've<00:00:38.520> gotten

00:00:38.750 --> 00:00:38.760 
choices as we go along so I've gotten

00:00:38.760 --> 00:00:40.760 
choices as we go along so I've gotten
doubles<00:00:38.969> for<00:00:39.090> gaudium<00:00:39.329> just<00:00:40.110> because<00:00:40.320> when

00:00:40.760 --> 00:00:40.770 
doubles for gaudium just because when

00:00:40.770 --> 00:00:42.110 
doubles for gaudium just because when
you<00:00:40.860> play<00:00:40.920> three<00:00:41.250> of<00:00:41.340> these<00:00:41.460> three<00:00:41.879> of<00:00:41.969> these

00:00:42.110 --> 00:00:42.120 
you play three of these three of these

00:00:42.120 --> 00:00:43.729 
you play three of these three of these
three<00:00:42.570> of<00:00:42.629> these<00:00:42.780> sometimes<00:00:43.290> you<00:00:43.469> can<00:00:43.590> have<00:00:43.710> a

00:00:43.729 --> 00:00:43.739 
three of these sometimes you can have a

00:00:43.739 --> 00:00:45.380 
three of these sometimes you can have a
non-playable<00:00:44.219> car<00:00:44.489> and<00:00:44.730> try<00:00:44.879> go<00:00:45.000> to<00:00:45.059> helps<00:00:45.329> you

00:00:45.380 --> 00:00:45.390 
non-playable car and try go to helps you

00:00:45.390 --> 00:00:47.389 
non-playable car and try go to helps you
survive<00:00:45.570> until<00:00:45.960> you<00:00:46.110> can<00:00:46.289> just<00:00:46.890> draw<00:00:47.039> like<00:00:47.250> you

00:00:47.389 --> 00:00:47.399 
survive until you can just draw like you

00:07:03.100 --> 00:07:03.110 
everything and go over game relatively

00:07:03.110 --> 00:07:05.980 
everything and go over game relatively
easy<00:07:03.500> to<00:07:03.650> run<00:07:04.069> to<00:07:04.280> and<00:07:04.490> without<00:07:05.300> pretty<00:07:05.870> much

00:07:05.980 --> 00:07:05.990 
easy to run to and without pretty much

00:07:05.990 --> 00:07:07.719 
easy to run to and without pretty much
be<00:07:06.229> as<00:07:06.349> the<00:07:06.470> only<00:07:06.590> expensive<00:07:06.949> carton<00:07:07.280> I<00:07:07.430> would

00:07:07.719 --> 00:07:07.729 
be as the only expensive carton I would

00:07:07.729 --> 00:07:09.969 
be as the only expensive carton I would
other<00:07:07.970> than<00:07:08.060> that<00:07:08.120> I<00:07:08.240> consider<00:07:08.479> it<00:07:08.690> budget<00:07:09.020> and

00:07:09.969 --> 00:07:09.979 
other than that I consider it budget and

00:07:09.979 --> 00:07:11.830 
other than that I consider it budget and
you<00:07:10.729> just<00:07:10.849> put<00:07:11.030> in<00:07:11.150> chaos<00:07:11.360> sorcerer<00:07:11.630> if<00:07:11.750> you

00:07:11.830 --> 00:07:11.840 
you just put in chaos sorcerer if you

00:07:11.840 --> 00:07:13.930 
you just put in chaos sorcerer if you
just<00:07:11.990> don't<00:07:12.110> have<00:07:12.289> them<00:07:12.500> but<00:07:12.680> doctors<00:07:13.430> still<00:07:13.580> I

00:07:13.930 --> 00:07:13.940 
just don't have them but doctors still I

00:07:13.940 --> 00:07:15.550 
just don't have them but doctors still I
would<00:07:14.270> say<00:07:14.389> it's<00:07:14.479> a<00:07:14.539> viable<00:07:14.720> deck<00:07:14.990> and<00:07:15.169> it'll

00:07:15.550 --> 00:07:15.560 
would say it's a viable deck and it'll

00:07:15.560 --> 00:07:19.450 
would say it's a viable deck and it'll
probably<00:07:15.710> be<00:07:15.889> a<00:07:15.919> Bible<00:07:16.310> deck<00:07:16.430> next<00:07:16.639> format<00:07:18.460> but

00:07:19.450 --> 00:07:19.460 
probably be a Bible deck next format but

00:07:19.460 --> 00:07:20.950 
probably be a Bible deck next format but
I<00:07:19.759> don't<00:07:19.969> know<00:07:20.030> fire<00:07:20.270> things<00:07:20.509> are<00:07:20.690> looking

looking<00:07:24.590> relatively<00:07:24.889> popular<00:07:25.370> but<00:07:25.699> I<00:07:26.000> mean<00:07:26.210> if

00:07:26.290 --> 00:07:26.300

00:07:26.300 --> 00:07:27.820
