00:00:50.350 --> 00:01:00.670
 my mother who does not escape the technique 

00:01:00.790 --> 00:01:03.960

00:01:07.620 --> 00:01:18.140

00:01:15.930 --> 00:01:18.140
 perfect 

00:01:20.450 --> 00:01:23.660

00:01:48.130 --> 00:01:51.180
 something will be 

00:01:51.970 --> 00:01:54.630
 speak 

00:01:57.630 --> 00:02:00.630
 partner 

00:02:13.420 --> 00:02:19.200
 aside I read leo 

00:02:16.390 --> 00:02:19.200

00:02:24.150 --> 00:02:27.450
 go Go 

00:02:35.079 --> 00:02:43.689
 when we go, they will tell us that 

00:02:37.760 --> 00:02:50.620
 they are pigs that today there is no 

00:02:43.689 --> 00:02:50.620
 problems no problem 

00:03:01.480 --> 00:03:04.480
 true 

00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:15.930
 and what do we do the transformation of 

00:03:12.820 --> 00:03:15.930
 transformers and I got stuck 

00:03:22.640 --> 00:03:29.870
 and equals 

00:03:30.280 --> 00:03:34.470
 anyway it was around one 

00:03:32.319 --> 00:03:34.470
 time 

00:03:35.340 --> 00:03:39.360
 a sandwich 

00:03:41.010 --> 00:03:45.439
 and a lot 

00:03:57.110 --> 00:04:02.900
 when you won and then 

00:04:12.799 --> 00:04:16.129
 It seems 

00:04:18.799 --> 00:04:23.060
 theory we should win because we have 

00:04:20.579 --> 00:04:23.060
 suit 

00:04:26.570 --> 00:04:32.720

00:04:30.560 --> 00:04:36.080
 5 

00:04:32.720 --> 00:04:39.020
 now how do we change the bike 

00:04:36.080 --> 00:04:47.090
 of gears that leads to a short gear 

00:04:39.020 --> 00:04:49.629
 The sole goes up, we are here only 

00:04:47.090 --> 00:04:49.629

00:05:06.740 --> 00:05:09.740

00:05:45.280 --> 00:05:48.280

00:06:06.090 --> 00:06:14.760
