00:00:24.109 --> 00:00:24.119 
a really really a good deck even though

00:00:24.119 --> 00:00:27.349 
a really really a good deck even though
straddles<00:00:24.480> is<00:00:24.600> gone<00:00:24.779> it's<00:00:25.260> not<00:00:25.439> like<00:00:26.300> it's<00:00:27.300> not

00:00:27.349 --> 00:00:27.359 
straddles is gone it's not like it's not

00:00:27.359 --> 00:00:29.929 
straddles is gone it's not like it's not
like<00:00:27.480> it's<00:00:27.990> not<00:00:28.710> like<00:00:28.769> it's<00:00:28.920> used<00:00:29.340> to<00:00:29.519> be<00:00:29.670> like

00:00:29.929 --> 00:00:29.939 
like it's not like it's used to be like

00:00:29.939 --> 00:00:32.990 
like it's not like it's used to be like
it's<00:00:30.720> yeah<00:00:31.679> it's<00:00:31.890> it's<00:00:32.250> this<00:00:32.520> so<00:00:32.700> you<00:00:32.820> don't

00:00:32.990 --> 00:00:33.000 
it's yeah it's it's this so you don't

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:35.720 
it's yeah it's it's this so you don't
way<00:00:33.090> that<00:00:33.780> that<00:00:33.870> into<00:00:34.290> a<00:00:34.520> really<00:00:35.520> different

00:00:35.720 --> 00:00:35.730 
way that that into a really different

00:00:35.730 --> 00:00:37.220 
way that that into a really different
approach<00:00:36.090> now<00:00:36.300> because<00:00:36.570> since<00:00:36.780> Stratos<00:00:37.110> is

00:00:37.220 --> 00:00:37.230 
approach now because since Stratos is

00:00:37.230 --> 00:00:39.670 
approach now because since Stratos is
gone<00:00:37.469> and<00:00:37.739> it's<00:00:38.579> more<00:00:38.820> about<00:00:39.000> like<00:00:39.210> alias

00:00:39.670 --> 00:00:39.680 
gone and it's more about like alias

00:00:39.680 --> 00:00:43.250 
gone and it's more about like alias
control<00:00:40.680> control<00:00:41.190> base<00:00:41.340> and<00:00:41.989> geminis<00:00:42.989> spark

00:00:43.250 --> 00:00:43.260 
control control base and geminis spark

00:00:43.260 --> 00:00:44.990 
control control base and geminis spark
and<00:00:43.469> you<00:00:43.590> just<00:00:43.770> would<00:00:44.219> basically<00:00:44.370> sack<00:00:44.850> with

00:00:44.990 --> 00:00:45.000 
and you just would basically sack with

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:46.910 
and you just would basically sack with
miracle<00:00:45.390> and<00:00:45.600> you<00:00:45.660> just<00:00:45.870> somebody<00:00:46.410> alias<00:00:46.770> and

00:00:46.910 --> 00:00:46.920 
miracle and you just somebody alias and

00:00:46.920 --> 00:00:48.290 
miracle and you just somebody alias and
just<00:00:47.039> English<00:00:47.340> beat<00:00:47.520> down<00:00:47.700> with<00:00:47.879> hero<00:00:48.059> glass

00:00:48.290 --> 00:00:48.300 
just English beat down with hero glass

00:00:48.300 --> 00:00:50.270 
just English beat down with hero glass
and<00:00:48.629> with<00:00:48.899> jump<00:00:49.079> as<00:00:49.200> spark<00:00:49.440> and<00:00:49.680> that's

00:00:50.270 --> 00:00:50.280 
and with jump as spark and that's

00:00:50.280 --> 00:00:52.610 
and with jump as spark and that's
basically<00:00:50.730> more<00:00:50.910> control<00:00:51.300> its<00:00:52.230> you<00:00:52.410> have<00:00:52.530> to

00:00:52.610 --> 00:00:52.620 
basically more control its you have to

00:00:52.620 --> 00:00:54.139 
basically more control its you have to
