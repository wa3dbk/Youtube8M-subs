glitches that are actually found by

00:00:15.030 --> 00:00:17.480 
glitches that are actually found by
myself<00:00:15.420> in<00:00:15.599> GTA<00:00:15.960> 5<00:00:16.230> online<00:00:16.440> and<00:00:16.920> in<00:00:17.130> single

00:00:17.480 --> 00:00:17.490 
myself in GTA 5 online and in single

00:00:17.490 --> 00:00:19.609 
myself in GTA 5 online and in single
player<00:00:17.520> and<00:00:17.880> basically<00:00:18.869> I<00:00:18.990> was<00:00:19.199> just<00:00:19.320> messing

00:00:19.609 --> 00:00:19.619 
player and basically I was just messing

00:00:19.619 --> 00:00:21.230 
player and basically I was just messing
around<00:00:19.680> and<00:00:20.010> I<00:00:20.070> found<00:00:20.100> these<00:00:20.460> by<00:00:20.640> myself<00:00:20.670> and

00:00:21.230 --> 00:00:21.240 
around and I found these by myself and

00:00:21.240 --> 00:00:23.120 
around and I found these by myself and
with<00:00:21.359> a<00:00:21.420> few<00:00:21.630> friends<00:00:21.689> and<00:00:22.230> they're<00:00:22.949> really

00:00:23.120 --> 00:00:23.130 
with a few friends and they're really

00:00:23.130 --> 00:00:25.460 
with a few friends and they're really
simple<00:00:23.640> and<00:00:23.789> easy<00:00:24.090> to<00:00:24.330> do<00:00:24.510> and<00:00:24.810> I<00:00:25.230> don't<00:00:25.410> know

00:00:25.460 --> 00:00:25.470 
simple and easy to do and I don't know

00:00:25.470 --> 00:00:27.230 
simple and easy to do and I don't know
if<00:00:25.560> they<00:00:25.650> all<00:00:25.800> work<00:00:26.010> in<00:00:26.160> online<00:00:26.490> because<00:00:26.939> I<00:00:26.970> did

00:00:27.230 --> 00:00:27.240 
if they all work in online because I did

00:00:27.240 --> 00:00:29.060 
if they all work in online because I did
do<00:00:27.420> two<00:00:27.840> out<00:00:28.019> of<00:00:28.050> the<00:00:28.199> three<00:00:28.470> in<00:00:28.680> single<00:00:29.039> player

00:00:29.060 --> 00:00:29.070 
do two out of the three in single player

00:00:29.070 --> 00:00:31.160 
do two out of the three in single player
but<00:00:29.640> as<00:00:29.730> you<00:00:29.820> can<00:00:29.910> see<00:00:30.090> the<00:00:30.210> first<00:00:30.510> one<00:00:30.779> is<00:00:30.810> not

00:00:31.160 --> 00:00:31.170 
but as you can see the first one is not

00:00:31.170 --> 00:00:32.600 
but as you can see the first one is not
very<00:00:31.410> interesting<00:00:31.980> neither<00:00:32.189> are<00:00:32.399> the<00:00:32.489> other

00:00:32.600 --> 00:00:32.610 
very interesting neither are the other

00:00:32.610 --> 00:00:34.790 
very interesting neither are the other
two<00:00:32.700> but<00:00:33.030> I<00:00:33.090> figured<00:00:33.510> I<00:00:33.780> would<00:00:34.350> just<00:00:34.380> make<00:00:34.680> it

00:00:34.790 --> 00:00:34.800 
two but I figured I would just make it

00:00:34.800 --> 00:00:36.560 
two but I figured I would just make it
into<00:00:35.040> one<00:00:35.250> video<00:00:35.430> instead<00:00:35.940> of<00:00:36.059> three<00:00:36.270> separate

00:00:36.560 --> 00:00:36.570 
into one video instead of three separate

00:00:36.570 --> 00:00:38.479 
into one video instead of three separate
ones<00:00:36.719> but<00:00:37.350> as<00:00:37.500> you<00:00:37.620> can<00:00:37.739> see<00:00:37.920> the<00:00:38.040> first<00:00:38.250> one<00:00:38.460> is

00:00:38.479 --> 00:00:38.489 
ones but as you can see the first one is

00:00:38.489 --> 00:00:40.790 
ones but as you can see the first one is
on<00:00:38.700> this<00:00:38.850> trolley<00:00:39.239> or<00:00:39.510> this<00:00:39.690> tram<00:00:40.020> car<00:00:40.290> when

00:00:40.790 --> 00:00:40.800 
on this trolley or this tram car when

00:00:40.800 --> 00:00:42.590 
on this trolley or this tram car when
you<00:00:40.860> hop<00:00:41.040> onto<00:00:41.250> with<00:00:41.520> a<00:00:41.550> bike<00:00:41.850> or<00:00:42.090> with<00:00:42.420> your

00:00:42.590 --> 00:00:42.600 
you hop onto with a bike or with your

00:00:42.600 --> 00:00:44.299 
you hop onto with a bike or with your
character<00:00:43.050> or<00:00:43.200> something<00:00:43.440> like<00:00:43.559> that<00:00:43.620> you

00:00:44.299 --> 00:00:44.309 
character or something like that you

00:00:44.309 --> 00:00:46.190 
character or something like that you
will<00:00:44.700> see<00:00:44.850> a<00:00:44.879> hexagon<00:00:45.450> and<00:00:45.480> if<00:00:45.809> you<00:00:45.899> get<00:00:45.989> close

00:00:46.190 --> 00:00:46.200 
will see a hexagon and if you get close

00:00:46.200 --> 00:00:47.930 
will see a hexagon and if you get close
enough<00:00:46.469> to<00:00:46.770> it<00:00:46.890> it<00:00:47.190> will<00:00:47.340> actually<00:00:47.460> change

00:00:47.930 --> 00:00:47.940 
enough to it it will actually change

00:00:47.940 --> 00:00:49.729 
enough to it it will actually change
from<00:00:48.180> the<00:00:48.300> hexagon<00:00:48.539> shape<00:00:49.140> into<00:00:49.469> another

00:00:49.729 --> 00:00:49.739 
from the hexagon shape into another

00:00:49.739 --> 00:00:52.340 
from the hexagon shape into another
shape<00:00:50.039> that<00:00:50.820> actually<00:00:51.120> has<00:00:51.270> more<00:00:51.300> sides<00:00:51.870> so

00:00:52.340 --> 00:00:52.350 
shape that actually has more sides so

00:00:52.350 --> 00:00:54.350 
shape that actually has more sides so
it's<00:00:52.829> kind<00:00:53.070> of<00:00:53.190> interesting<00:00:53.460> it's<00:00:54.090> a<00:00:54.149> little

00:00:54.350 --> 00:00:54.360 
it's kind of interesting it's a little

00:00:54.360 --> 00:00:55.670 
it's kind of interesting it's a little
bit<00:00:54.480> weird<00:00:54.660> and<00:00:54.989> I<00:00:55.050> thought<00:00:55.199> it<00:00:55.289> was<00:00:55.379> a<00:00:55.410> cool

00:00:55.670 --> 00:00:55.680 
bit weird and I thought it was a cool

00:00:55.680 --> 00:00:57.770 
bit weird and I thought it was a cool
enough<00:00:55.920> fine<00:00:56.129> to<00:00:56.370> put<00:00:56.610> in<00:00:56.730> this<00:00:56.850> video<00:00:57.120> so

00:00:57.770 --> 00:00:57.780 
enough fine to put in this video so

00:00:57.780 --> 00:00:59.599 
enough fine to put in this video so
after<00:00:58.140> doing<00:00:58.379> this<00:00:58.620> glitch<00:00:59.010> or<00:00:59.250> whatever<00:00:59.520> you

00:00:59.599 --> 00:00:59.609 
after doing this glitch or whatever you

00:00:59.609 --> 00:01:00.830 
after doing this glitch or whatever you
want<00:00:59.760> to<00:00:59.820> call<00:01:00.030> it<00:01:00.090> if<00:01:00.329> you<00:01:00.420> go<00:01:00.539> a<00:01:00.570> certain

00:01:00.830 --> 00:01:00.840 
want to call it if you go a certain

00:01:00.840 --> 00:01:02.389 
want to call it if you go a certain
enough<00:01:01.230> for<00:01:01.620> a<00:01:01.649> certain<00:01:01.949> amount<00:01:01.980> of<00:01:02.219> distance

00:01:02.389 --> 00:01:02.399 
enough for a certain amount of distance

00:01:02.399 --> 00:01:05.060 
enough for a certain amount of distance
away<00:01:02.699> from<00:01:02.820> the<00:01:03.180> hexagon<00:01:03.690> shape<00:01:04.290> or<00:01:04.559> the<00:01:04.589> shape

00:01:05.060 --> 00:01:05.070 
away from the hexagon shape or the shape

00:01:05.070 --> 00:01:07.700 
away from the hexagon shape or the shape
that<00:01:05.129> changed<00:01:05.760> from<00:01:06.030> the<00:01:06.180> ex-con<00:01:06.659> that<00:01:07.560> has

00:01:07.700 --> 00:01:07.710 
that changed from the ex-con that has

00:01:07.710 --> 00:01:09.859 
that changed from the ex-con that has
more<00:01:07.950> shapes<00:01:08.250> or<00:01:08.430> sides<00:01:08.670> or<00:01:08.820> whatever<00:01:09.030> it<00:01:09.750> will

00:01:09.859 --> 00:01:09.869 
more shapes or sides or whatever it will

00:01:09.869 --> 00:01:12.020 
more shapes or sides or whatever it will
change<00:01:10.080> back<00:01:10.350> into<00:01:10.380> a<00:01:10.650> hexagon<00:01:11.220> I<00:01:11.490> probably

00:01:12.020 --> 00:01:12.030 
change back into a hexagon I probably

00:01:12.030 --> 00:01:13.880 
change back into a hexagon I probably
confuse<00:01:12.450> you<00:01:12.600> there<00:01:12.780> a<00:01:12.810> bit<00:01:13.020> so<00:01:13.500> the<00:01:13.619> next<00:01:13.770> one

00:01:13.880 --> 00:01:13.890 
confuse you there a bit so the next one

00:01:13.890 --> 00:01:15.590 
confuse you there a bit so the next one
we<00:01:14.130> have<00:01:14.310> here<00:01:14.340> is<00:01:14.640> actually<00:01:14.970> at<00:01:15.060> the<00:01:15.150> beach<00:01:15.360> at

00:01:15.590 --> 00:01:15.600 
we have here is actually at the beach at

00:01:15.600 --> 00:01:17.359 
we have here is actually at the beach at
any<00:01:15.780> lifeguard<00:01:16.290> tower<00:01:16.500> it<00:01:16.770> should<00:01:16.979> have<00:01:17.159> an

00:01:17.359 --> 00:01:17.369 
any lifeguard tower it should have an

00:01:17.369 --> 00:01:18.859 
any lifeguard tower it should have an
American<00:01:17.790> flag<00:01:17.939> that's<00:01:18.299> just<00:01:18.509> flying<00:01:18.750> by

00:01:18.859 --> 00:01:18.869 
American flag that's just flying by

00:01:18.869 --> 00:01:20.780 
American flag that's just flying by
itself<00:01:19.259> in<00:01:19.470> the<00:01:19.560> wind<00:01:19.799> all<00:01:20.130> you<00:01:20.310> have<00:01:20.400> to<00:01:20.490> do<00:01:20.610> to

00:01:20.780 --> 00:01:20.790 
itself in the wind all you have to do to

00:01:20.790 --> 00:01:22.880 
itself in the wind all you have to do to
make<00:01:20.909> it<00:01:20.970> spaz<00:01:21.420> out<00:01:21.720> I<00:01:22.080> guess<00:01:22.500> you<00:01:22.619> could<00:01:22.770> call

00:01:22.880 --> 00:01:22.890 
make it spaz out I guess you could call

00:01:22.890 --> 00:01:25.249 
make it spaz out I guess you could call
this<00:01:23.070> a<00:01:23.130> spazzy<00:01:23.700> fly<00:01:24.570> glitch<00:01:24.869> or<00:01:24.960> whatever<00:01:25.170> you

00:01:25.249 --> 00:01:25.259 
this a spazzy fly glitch or whatever you

00:01:25.259 --> 00:01:26.600 
this a spazzy fly glitch or whatever you
want<00:01:25.380> to<00:01:25.439> call<00:01:25.530> it<00:01:25.590> now<00:01:26.070> all<00:01:26.220> you<00:01:26.340> have<00:01:26.369> to<00:01:26.490> do

00:01:26.600 --> 00:01:26.610 
want to call it now all you have to do

00:01:26.610 --> 00:01:28.190 
want to call it now all you have to do
for<00:01:26.759> this<00:01:26.880> one<00:01:27.150> is<00:01:27.299> actually<00:01:27.479> very<00:01:27.720> very

00:01:28.190 --> 00:01:28.200 
for this one is actually very very

00:01:28.200 --> 00:01:29.719 
for this one is actually very very
simple<00:01:28.439> just<00:01:28.680> go<00:01:28.860> to<00:01:28.920> the<00:01:29.100> beach<00:01:29.250> find<00:01:29.549> one<00:01:29.700> of

00:01:29.719 --> 00:01:29.729 
simple just go to the beach find one of

00:01:29.729 --> 00:01:31.580 
simple just go to the beach find one of
these<00:01:29.850> flags<00:01:30.180> throw<00:01:30.570> some<00:01:30.780> sticky<00:01:31.110> bombs<00:01:31.290> next

00:01:31.580 --> 00:01:31.590 
these flags throw some sticky bombs next

00:01:31.590 --> 00:01:33.380 
these flags throw some sticky bombs next
to<00:01:31.650> the<00:01:31.770> flag<00:01:32.009> anywhere<00:01:32.490> near<00:01:32.759> it<00:01:32.790> or<00:01:32.970> on<00:01:33.210> the

00:01:33.380 --> 00:01:33.390 
to the flag anywhere near it or on the

00:01:33.390 --> 00:01:35.660 
to the flag anywhere near it or on the
pole<00:01:33.659> and<00:01:33.930> then<00:01:34.619> blow<00:01:34.829> it<00:01:34.860> up<00:01:35.070> and<00:01:35.220> the<00:01:35.430> flag

00:01:35.660 --> 00:01:35.670 
pole and then blow it up and the flag

00:01:35.670 --> 00:01:37.520 
pole and then blow it up and the flag
should<00:01:35.700> start<00:01:36.090> spazzing<00:01:36.329> out<00:01:36.630> it<00:01:37.020> also<00:01:37.200> works

00:01:37.520 --> 00:01:37.530 
should start spazzing out it also works

00:01:37.530 --> 00:01:39.230 
should start spazzing out it also works
for<00:01:37.619> the<00:01:37.710> helicopter<00:01:38.280> if<00:01:38.369> you<00:01:38.460> fly<00:01:38.729> it<00:01:38.790> near<00:01:39.090> it

00:01:39.230 --> 00:01:39.240 
for the helicopter if you fly it near it

00:01:39.240 --> 00:01:41.390 
for the helicopter if you fly it near it
so<00:01:39.720> basically<00:01:40.259> with<00:01:40.500> this<00:01:40.650> next<00:01:40.860> one<00:01:41.130> it's

00:01:41.390 --> 00:01:41.400 
so basically with this next one it's

00:01:41.400 --> 00:01:42.980 
so basically with this next one it's
simple<00:01:42.000> and<00:01:42.119> I<00:01:42.240> don't<00:01:42.390> know<00:01:42.450> if<00:01:42.570> you<00:01:42.659> can<00:01:42.780> do<00:01:42.899> it

00:01:42.980 --> 00:01:42.990 
simple and I don't know if you can do it

00:01:42.990 --> 00:01:44.569 
simple and I don't know if you can do it
every<00:01:43.200> time<00:01:43.229> but<00:01:43.829> as<00:01:43.950> you<00:01:44.040> can<00:01:44.130> see<00:01:44.310> here<00:01:44.549> I

00:01:44.569 --> 00:01:44.579 
every time but as you can see here I

00:01:44.579 --> 00:01:47.330 
every time but as you can see here I
veered<00:01:45.000> out<00:01:45.119> of<00:01:45.270> the<00:01:45.329> way<00:01:45.509> of<00:01:45.720> a<00:01:45.840> red<00:01:46.140> car<00:01:46.500> and

00:01:47.330 --> 00:01:47.340 
veered out of the way of a red car and

00:01:47.340 --> 00:01:49.429 
veered out of the way of a red car and
then<00:01:47.490> my<00:01:47.640> world<00:01:47.970> turned<00:01:48.210> very<00:01:48.630> weird<00:01:49.049> and<00:01:49.259> like

00:01:49.429 --> 00:01:49.439 
then my world turned very weird and like

00:01:49.439 --> 00:01:51.350 
then my world turned very weird and like
three<00:01:49.710> dimensional<00:01:50.280> looking<00:01:50.610> and<00:01:50.820> now<00:01:51.180> what

00:01:51.350 --> 00:01:51.360 
three dimensional looking and now what

00:01:51.360 --> 00:01:52.880 
three dimensional looking and now what
happened<00:01:51.659> after<00:01:51.840> that<00:01:51.899> is<00:01:52.259> me<00:01:52.560> actually

00:01:52.880 --> 00:01:52.890 
happened after that is me actually

00:01:52.890 --> 00:01:54.950 
happened after that is me actually
hitting<00:01:53.189> another<00:01:53.460> car<00:01:53.579> then<00:01:54.540> I<00:01:54.630> fell<00:01:54.810> off<00:01:54.899> my

00:01:54.950 --> 00:01:54.960 
hitting another car then I fell off my

00:01:54.960 --> 00:01:57.020 
hitting another car then I fell off my
bike<00:01:55.439> and<00:01:55.710> what<00:01:55.829> happened<00:01:56.250> is<00:01:56.490> I<00:01:56.520> tried<00:01:56.939> to

00:01:57.020 --> 00:01:57.030 
bike and what happened is I tried to

00:01:57.030 --> 00:01:59.240 
bike and what happened is I tried to
find<00:01:57.240> my<00:01:57.390> bike<00:01:57.600> and<00:01:57.780> I<00:01:57.840> did<00:01:58.110> I<00:01:58.320> just<00:01:58.890> ran<00:01:59.100> it

00:01:59.240 --> 00:01:59.250 
find my bike and I did I just ran it

00:01:59.250 --> 00:02:01.370 
find my bike and I did I just ran it
over<00:01:59.340> with<00:01:59.640> this<00:01:59.759> car<00:02:00.060> I<00:02:00.299> got<00:02:00.689> out<00:02:00.719> and<00:02:01.049> I<00:02:01.229> got

00:02:01.370 --> 00:02:01.380 
over with this car I got out and I got

00:02:01.380 --> 00:02:03.770 
over with this car I got out and I got
back<00:02:01.619> on<00:02:01.829> the<00:02:02.009> bike<00:02:02.219> in<00:02:02.460> my<00:02:02.579> world<00:02:02.820> was<00:02:03.479> like

00:02:03.770 --> 00:02:03.780 
back on the bike in my world was like

00:02:03.780 --> 00:02:05.209 
back on the bike in my world was like
that<00:02:03.990> three-dimensional<00:02:04.380> world<00:02:04.950> and<00:02:05.070> it

00:02:05.209 --> 00:02:05.219 
that three-dimensional world and it

00:02:05.219 --> 00:02:07.010 
that three-dimensional world and it
looked<00:02:05.369> very<00:02:05.430> cool<00:02:05.939> and<00:02:06.149> i<00:02:06.570> could<00:02:06.630> see<00:02:06.780> the

00:02:07.010 --> 00:02:07.020 
looked very cool and i could see the

00:02:07.020 --> 00:02:08.479 
looked very cool and i could see the
city<00:02:07.259> i<00:02:07.380> could<00:02:07.590> see<00:02:07.710> the<00:02:07.829> train<00:02:08.039> tracks<00:02:08.340> i

00:02:08.479 --> 00:02:08.489 
city i could see the train tracks i

00:02:08.489 --> 00:02:09.889 
city i could see the train tracks i
could<00:02:08.640> see<00:02:08.789> everything<00:02:09.090> but<00:02:09.450> the<00:02:09.629> ground

00:02:09.889 --> 00:02:09.899 
could see everything but the ground

00:02:09.899 --> 00:02:12.940 
could see everything but the ground
beneath<00:02:10.080> me<00:02:10.500> it<00:02:11.160> was<00:02:11.280> very<00:02:11.310> cool<00:02:11.760> i<00:02:12.000> get

00:02:12.940 --> 00:02:12.950 
beneath me it was very cool i get

00:02:12.950 --> 00:02:14.220 
beneath me it was very cool i get
she<00:02:13.040> could<00:02:13.190> call<00:02:13.340> this<00:02:13.459> the<00:02:13.700> Train

00:02:14.220 --> 00:02:14.230 
she could call this the Train

00:02:14.230 --> 00:02:15.520 
she could call this the Train
three-dimensional<00:02:15.230> glitch<00:02:15.379> or<00:02:15.470> something

00:02:15.520 --> 00:02:15.530 
three-dimensional glitch or something

00:02:15.530 --> 00:02:17.259 
three-dimensional glitch or something
like<00:02:15.860> that's<00:02:16.069> really<00:02:16.280> weird<00:02:16.550> but<00:02:17.000> as<00:02:17.120> you<00:02:17.180> can

00:02:17.259 --> 00:02:17.269 
like that's really weird but as you can

00:02:17.269 --> 00:02:18.880 
like that's really weird but as you can
see<00:02:17.450> I<00:02:17.480> can<00:02:17.540> see<00:02:17.870> the<00:02:18.019> city<00:02:18.290> I<00:02:18.410> can<00:02:18.590> see<00:02:18.709> a<00:02:18.739> whole

00:02:18.880 --> 00:02:18.890 
see I can see the city I can see a whole

00:02:18.890 --> 00:02:20.380 
see I can see the city I can see a whole
bunch<00:02:19.069> of<00:02:19.160> stuff<00:02:19.220> and<00:02:19.580> there's<00:02:19.970> this<00:02:20.060> weird

00:02:20.380 --> 00:02:20.390 
bunch of stuff and there's this weird

00:02:20.390 --> 00:02:22.570 
bunch of stuff and there's this weird
like<00:02:20.599> square<00:02:21.140> that<00:02:21.379> you<00:02:21.440> can<00:02:21.530> see<00:02:21.739> into<00:02:21.890> and<00:02:22.340> it

00:02:22.570 --> 00:02:22.580 
like square that you can see into and it

00:02:22.580 --> 00:02:23.949 
like square that you can see into and it
looks<00:02:22.730> three-dimensional<00:02:23.060> when<00:02:23.569> you<00:02:23.660> go<00:02:23.780> into

00:02:23.949 --> 00:02:23.959 
looks three-dimensional when you go into

00:02:23.959 --> 00:02:26.259 
looks three-dimensional when you go into
it<00:02:24.200> looks<00:02:24.379> very<00:02:24.680> very<00:02:24.739> cool<00:02:25.190> so<00:02:25.730> I<00:02:25.760> figured<00:02:26.150> I

00:02:26.259 --> 00:02:26.269 
it looks very very cool so I figured I

00:02:26.269 --> 00:02:27.580 
it looks very very cool so I figured I
would<00:02:26.420> show<00:02:26.569> you<00:02:26.599> guys<00:02:26.840> these<00:02:27.200> glitches

00:02:27.580 --> 00:02:27.590 
would show you guys these glitches

00:02:27.590 --> 00:02:29.380 
would show you guys these glitches
because<00:02:28.069> they<00:02:28.220> were<00:02:28.280> actually<00:02:28.459> founded<00:02:29.030> by<00:02:29.180> me

00:02:29.380 --> 00:02:29.390 
because they were actually founded by me

00:02:29.390 --> 00:02:31.059 
because they were actually founded by me
surprisingly<00:02:30.110> because<00:02:30.349> I<00:02:30.500> usually<00:02:30.890> find

00:02:31.059 --> 00:02:31.069 
surprisingly because I usually find

00:02:31.069 --> 00:02:33.250 
surprisingly because I usually find
nothing<00:02:31.519> but<00:02:32.090> they<00:02:32.390> were<00:02:32.450> funded<00:02:32.750> by<00:02:32.840> me<00:02:32.989> and

00:02:33.250 --> 00:02:33.260 
nothing but they were funded by me and

00:02:33.260 --> 00:02:35.440 
nothing but they were funded by me and
they<00:02:33.349> were<00:02:33.410> all<00:02:33.650> like<00:02:34.040> simple<00:02:34.610> and<00:02:34.880> not<00:02:35.180> really

00:02:35.440 --> 00:02:35.450 
they were all like simple and not really

00:02:35.450 --> 00:02:37.390 
they were all like simple and not really
interesting<00:02:36.019> glitches<00:02:36.410> to<00:02:36.739> make<00:02:36.920> a<00:02:36.950> three

00:02:37.390 --> 00:02:37.400 
interesting glitches to make a three

00:02:37.400 --> 00:02:40.240 
interesting glitches to make a three
separate<00:02:37.700> videos<00:02:38.000> on<00:02:38.180> but<00:02:38.720> basically<00:02:39.230> um<00:02:39.769> as

00:02:40.240 --> 00:02:40.250 
separate videos on but basically um as

00:02:40.250 --> 00:02:41.650 
separate videos on but basically um as
you<00:02:40.430> guys<00:02:40.580> know<00:02:40.640> about<00:02:40.880> to<00:02:41.209> hit<00:02:41.360> forty

00:02:41.650 --> 00:02:41.660 
you guys know about to hit forty

00:02:41.660 --> 00:02:44.289 
you guys know about to hit forty
