so<00:02:44.519> I<00:02:44.549> definitely<00:02:44.879> I<00:02:45.090> just<00:02:45.269> had<00:02:45.420> to<00:02:45.569> chop<00:02:46.049> this

00:02:46.460 --> 00:02:46.470 
so I definitely I just had to chop this

00:02:46.470 --> 00:02:50.360 
so I definitely I just had to chop this
whole<00:02:47.209> piece<00:02:48.209> off<00:02:48.480> and<00:02:48.930> then<00:02:49.140> angle<00:02:49.680> cut<00:02:50.189> this

00:02:50.360 --> 00:02:50.370 
whole piece off and then angle cut this

00:02:50.370 --> 00:02:53.600 
whole piece off and then angle cut this
with<00:02:50.549> the<00:02:50.670> exacto<00:02:51.209> down<00:02:51.629> and<00:02:52.110> shave<00:02:52.620> it<00:02:52.860> the

00:02:53.600 --> 00:02:53.610 
with the exacto down and shave it the

00:02:53.610 --> 00:02:56.509 
with the exacto down and shave it the
thickness<00:02:54.000> but<00:02:54.989> down<00:02:55.230> to<00:02:55.260> like<00:02:55.590> that<00:02:55.920> to<00:02:56.370> get

00:02:56.509 --> 00:02:56.519 
thickness but down to like that to get

00:02:56.519 --> 00:02:58.849 
thickness but down to like that to get
it<00:02:56.700> to<00:02:57.269> go<00:02:57.390> into<00:02:57.629> opening<00:02:58.079> that's<00:02:58.319> down<00:02:58.560> under

00:02:58.849 --> 00:02:58.859

00:03:03.559 --> 00:03:03.569 
there I do that for both sides and these

00:03:03.569 --> 00:03:07.699 
there I do that for both sides and these
little<00:03:03.720> mullions<00:03:04.290> here<00:03:05.269> right<00:03:06.269> there<00:03:06.510> up<00:03:07.140> here

00:03:07.699 --> 00:03:07.709 
little mullions here right there up here

00:03:07.709 --> 00:03:09.770 
little mullions here right there up here
up<00:03:08.099> here<00:03:08.129> up<00:03:08.489> here<00:03:08.579> they<00:03:08.879> didn't<00:03:09.060> even<00:03:09.150> fit<00:03:09.540> I

like the instructions said and put the
black<00:03:29.220> things<00:03:29.579> on<00:03:29.819> those<00:03:30.090> go<00:03:30.299> on<00:03:30.590> next-to-last

00:03:32.179 --> 00:03:32.189 
black things on those go on next-to-last

00:03:32.189 --> 00:03:34.460 
black things on those go on next-to-last
and<00:03:32.340> now<00:03:33.180> they're<00:03:33.329> just<00:03:33.510> slotted<00:03:34.079> and<00:03:34.379> they

00:03:34.460 --> 00:03:34.470

just slide down in there and it did

00:03:39.299 --> 00:03:41.960 
just slide down in there and it did
pretty<00:03:39.510> good<00:03:39.689> I<00:03:40.200> was<00:03:40.319> surprised<00:03:40.709> it<00:03:41.069> uh<00:03:41.129> it<00:03:41.579> fit

00:03:41.960 --> 00:03:41.970

pretty good I was surprised it uh it fit
you<00:03:42.299> know<00:03:42.419> it<00:03:42.599> went<00:03:42.810> in<00:03:42.989> between<00:03:44.419> their<00:03:45.419> corner

00:03:45.770 --> 00:03:45.780 
you know it went in between their corner
