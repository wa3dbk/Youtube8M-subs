thing we've thought about is keeping
storage<00:02:16.880> back<00:02:17.090> of<00:02:17.239> house<00:02:17.450> you<00:02:17.959> don't<00:02:18.170> need<00:02:18.260> to

00:02:18.370 --> 00:02:18.380 
storage back of house you don't need to

00:02:18.380 --> 00:02:19.540 
storage back of house you don't need to
finish<00:02:18.530> that<00:02:18.680> space<00:02:19.069> when<00:02:19.280> you're<00:02:19.400> renovating

00:02:19.540 --> 00:02:19.550 
finish that space when you're renovating

00:02:19.550 --> 00:02:32.600 
finish that space when you're renovating
and<00:02:20.000> that<00:02:20.090> saves<00:02:20.330> you<00:02:20.450> a<00:02:20.480> few<00:02:20.690> dollars

00:02:32.600 --> 00:02:32.610 

00:02:32.610 --> 00:02:34.650 

so<00:02:33.610> this<00:02:33.820> area<00:02:34.000> is<00:02:34.150> probably<00:02:34.450> my<00:02:34.630> favorite

00:02:34.650 --> 00:02:34.660 
so this area is probably my favorite

00:02:34.660 --> 00:02:37.290 
so this area is probably my favorite
part<00:02:35.350> of<00:02:35.560> the<00:02:35.800> renovation<00:02:35.980> this<00:02:36.970> is<00:02:37.090> going<00:02:37.240> to

00:03:29.520 --> 00:03:29.530 
space and she's pretty much going to

00:03:29.530 --> 00:03:31.470 
space and she's pretty much going to
have<00:03:29.680> this<00:03:29.920> back<00:03:30.160> area<00:03:30.400> here<00:03:30.790> what<00:03:31.360> we're

00:03:34.860 --> 00:03:34.870 
advantage so it's going to go from this

00:03:34.870 --> 00:03:38.009 
advantage so it's going to go from this
wall<00:03:35.110> all<00:03:35.680> the<00:03:35.739> way<00:03:36.220> through<00:03:36.430> that<00:03:36.550> wall<00:03:37.019> this
