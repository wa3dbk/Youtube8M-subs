 but constructivist genetic success 

00:00:08.559 --> 00:00:11.299
 Unit 7 fields of application 

00:00:11.299 --> 00:00:14.239
 the conceptualizations of literacy 

00:00:14.239 --> 00:00:17.349
 the written language possess social and cultural value 

00:00:17.349 --> 00:00:21.390
 allows communication with someone who does not share the same context 

00:00:21.390 --> 00:00:24.779
 is an instrument that enables knowledge and understanding of 

00:00:24.779 --> 00:00:28.010
 our history as a species of culture and the world in which we live 

00:00:28.529 --> 00:00:33.180
 it is now known that in writing it is not only a psychomotor fact 

00:00:33.180 --> 00:00:36.860
 neither perceptual nor a copy but it is a cognitive process 

00:00:37.690 --> 00:00:42.290
 writing also implies a task of conceptual order an operation 

00:00:42.290 --> 00:00:46.210
 highly abstract intelligence that is defined as the ability to 

00:00:46.210 --> 00:00:49.940
 produce meanings that are represented through a complex system of 

00:00:49.940 --> 00:00:51.540
 signs of faith 

00:00:51.540 --> 00:00:55.760
 In this sense, patents that after a teaching-learning process in 

00:00:55.760 --> 00:00:57.930
 Africa a phonological awareness 

00:00:57.930 --> 00:01:02.220
 is a reflection that will embody to understand the surveys 

00:01:02.220 --> 00:01:05.540
 will be presented by another person I cook traffic 

00:01:05.540 --> 00:01:08.460
 which in turn will be combined with others 

00:01:08.460 --> 00:01:12.820
 strict sonorous novelties are constructed words that have a 

00:01:12.820 --> 00:01:14.810
 determined means 

00:01:14.810 --> 00:01:17.750
 Yellen dedicated his life to the investigation of the origin of 

00:01:17.750 --> 00:01:20.850
 knowledge and cognitive processes in children 

00:01:20.850 --> 00:01:24.390
 his theory that explains what the human being is an active organism that 

00:01:24.390 --> 00:01:28.090
 build knowledge through interactions with the environment 

00:01:29.150 --> 00:01:33.380
 so the infant constructs mental issues gradually through a 

00:01:33.380 --> 00:01:37.180
 cognitive development what happens evolutionarily through four 

00:01:37.180 --> 00:01:38.520
 stages 

00:01:38.520 --> 00:01:39.960
 sensorimotor 

00:01:39.960 --> 00:01:43.900
 but operational operational concrete the operation has formed 

00:01:45.010 --> 00:01:49.310
 reading examined the learning of literacy however 

00:01:49.310 --> 00:01:51.010
 ferrero and what of 

00:01:51.010 --> 00:01:54.860
 in the eighties they affirmed that the initial learning of the reading and writing 

00:01:54.860 --> 00:01:58.840
 depends on lembo or physical and mental wind of the learner with the language 

00:01:58.840 --> 00:01:59.800
 written 

00:01:59.800 --> 00:02:05.530
 In that sense, reading is not about politics but about building meanings. 

00:02:05.530 --> 00:02:09.729
 is to copy words passively have to actively tighten the 

00:02:09.729 --> 00:02:13.280
 early learning of ocular literacy build and 

00:02:13.280 --> 00:02:15.699
 rebuild in this language 

00:02:15.699 --> 00:02:19.669
 coasts with the respected written language making efforts to meet the peaks 

00:02:19.669 --> 00:02:22.149
 in the amazons that more drinks figo 

00:02:22.149 --> 00:02:26.369
 However, there are occasions when equilibria occur between what 

00:02:26.369 --> 00:02:30.449
 know the operation of the sector regarding the information can be 

00:02:30.449 --> 00:02:31.339
 as well 

00:02:31.339 --> 00:02:34.829
 in this way he experiments with different ways to see read or write 

00:02:36.069 --> 00:02:39.789
 to the extent that the environment cicig and proposing and child the use of 

00:02:39.789 --> 00:02:40.889
 literacy 

00:02:40.889 --> 00:02:42.929
 the ability to read write 

00:02:42.929 --> 00:02:46.819
 they transform the rules they use to prescribe by looking 

00:02:46.819 --> 00:02:49.849
 gradually more than that of adults 

00:02:49.849 --> 00:02:53.810
 the development of literacy as a system of cultural communication and 

00:02:53.810 --> 00:02:57.989
