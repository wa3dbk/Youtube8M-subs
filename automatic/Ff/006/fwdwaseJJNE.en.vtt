00:00:31.489 --> 00:00:34.730
 the typical ford caganer 

00:00:34.730 --> 00:00:37.640
 you will open 

00:00:37.640 --> 00:00:40.480
 the people found at the most left brave 

00:00:40.480 --> 00:00:43.480

00:00:50.680 --> 00:00:52.270
 I'm rude 

00:00:52.270 --> 00:00:53.640

00:01:04.900 --> 00:01:08.720

00:01:22.950 --> 00:01:24.550
 my computer 

00:01:24.550 --> 00:01:26.330
 these two points 

00:01:26.330 --> 00:01:27.380

 The phone call was made by Fiona Donkey. 

00:02:50.149 --> 00:02:53.149

00:02:56.079 --> 00:02:59.079

 the royal family showing itself 

00:03:12.559 --> 00:03:15.089
 if you want to put it if you are busy for your fast 

00:03:15.089 --> 00:03:18.089
 and it only worked beautiful one that shows sci fi 

00:03:19.549 --> 00:03:21.969
 every passing day 

00:03:21.969 --> 00:03:23.989
 criticize 

00:03:23.989 --> 00:03:24.840

00:03:27.449 --> 00:03:28.879
 dead jar 

00:03:28.879 --> 00:03:31.879
 in proportion to enrollment 

00:03:33.549 --> 00:03:36.409
 just missing comments that explains that within the law 

00:03:36.409 --> 00:03:39.229
 Do you think you're going to explain it right? 

00:03:39.229 --> 00:03:40.479
 one that does 

00:03:40.479 --> 00:03:43.479
 the first thing that is going to be done this year 

00:03:46.089 --> 00:03:47.429
 each one of them 

00:03:47.429 --> 00:03:50.829
 he will explain everything 

00:03:50.829 --> 00:03:53.829
 done that it formed a rosa helena fazio 

00:03:54.509 --> 00:03:57.079
 last july 

00:03:57.079 --> 00:04:00.079
 I thought you could understand 

00:04:00.999 --> 00:04:04.939
 your new entrance door as it will be the one you want to send and 

00:04:04.939 --> 00:04:07.939

 I'll talk about work 

00:04:11.699 --> 00:04:13.559
 create shortcuts 

00:04:13.559 --> 00:04:16.979
 You're always going to come in here. I'm not going to come in because my mother stays there. 

00:04:16.979 --> 00:04:19.189
 ferzat when the program 

00:04:19.189 --> 00:04:22.189
 was taken will lock 

00:04:23.050 --> 00:04:25.580
 You'll pay well forever for that. 

00:04:25.580 --> 00:04:28.840
 The timbu will stick to the goal 

00:04:28.840 --> 00:04:31.159
 if you enter rio 

00:04:31.159 --> 00:04:32.300
 valinhos 

00:04:32.300 --> 00:04:34.710
 on the beatles team 

00:04:34.710 --> 00:04:38.110
 You'll have to put Edno. 

00:04:38.110 --> 00:04:40.309
 by the way 

00:04:40.309 --> 00:04:44.219
 sometimes it will happen pcp does not work then it has to be done 

00:04:44.219 --> 00:04:46.999
 you marina goes by to create the author 

00:04:46.999 --> 00:04:48.830
 play there again 

00:04:48.830 --> 00:04:53.069
 because something plays there again when it does not work you will do the 

00:04:53.069 --> 00:04:54.009
 placebo 

00:04:54.009 --> 00:04:54.890
 because 

00:04:54.890 --> 00:04:57.370
 who plays there was presented by them 

00:04:57.370 --> 00:04:59.650
 this data explains that it will enter 

00:04:59.650 --> 00:05:01.879
 but when it did it will not stop 

00:05:01.879 --> 00:05:03.809
 this if the prosecution's anti-virus 

00:05:03.809 --> 00:05:05.330
 Did you notice the theft? 

00:05:05.330 --> 00:05:06.620
 when Libya 

00:05:06.620 --> 00:05:09.620
 or when you use suzart 

00:05:10.169 --> 00:05:14.639
 is to trap the saw because the whole problem mark is accused by a 

00:05:15.139 --> 00:05:18.139
 but it must be between them that they can ascertain if he does not 

00:05:18.860 --> 00:05:21.650
 there you put and dinora 

00:05:21.650 --> 00:05:25.069
 or else let the southern jubilee of the country that passes through play 

00:05:25.069 --> 00:05:28.309
 if approved by the bank 

00:05:28.309 --> 00:05:30.249
 the city is ready 

00:05:30.249 --> 00:05:31.669
 he goes by 

00:05:31.669 --> 00:05:33.469
 open the figc reported 

00:05:33.469 --> 00:05:35.729
 they are not easy 

00:05:35.729 --> 00:05:38.729
 the past home 

00:05:40.389 --> 00:05:42.379
 nicole last year 

00:05:42.379 --> 00:05:45.009
 if you want because you do not even play there 

00:05:45.009 --> 00:05:48.150
 was what I did a phase you that is what you said 

00:05:48.150 --> 00:05:50.870
 regina duarte 

00:05:50.870 --> 00:05:52.870
 done that's just 

00:05:52.870 --> 00:05:54.219

00:06:01.680 --> 00:06:03.199
 Venice 

00:06:03.199 --> 00:06:05.129
 so that's it 

00:06:05.129 --> 00:06:07.110
