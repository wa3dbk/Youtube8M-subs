of things that ended up that needed to

00:02:18.480 --> 00:02:20.510 
of things that ended up that needed to
be<00:02:18.599> taken<00:02:18.780> to<00:02:18.989> the<00:02:19.230> kids<00:02:19.440> bedrooms<00:02:20.010> that

00:02:32.180 --> 00:02:32.190 
is is that things will go in there and

00:02:32.190 --> 00:02:34.160 
is is that things will go in there and
that<00:02:32.400> need<00:02:32.580> to<00:02:32.790> be<00:02:32.819> taken<00:02:33.300> upstairs<00:02:33.450> and

old<00:04:02.540> house<00:04:02.750> which<00:04:03.020> had<00:04:03.230> a<00:04:03.470> completely

00:04:04.060 --> 00:04:04.070 
old house which had a completely

00:04:04.070 --> 00:04:06.850 
old house which had a completely
different<00:04:04.270> organizing<00:04:05.270> system<00:04:05.750> in<00:04:05.930> it<00:04:06.110> I

00:04:06.850 --> 00:04:06.860 
different organizing system in it I

00:04:06.860 --> 00:04:09.600 
different organizing system in it I
think<00:04:07.760> I've<00:04:07.880> come<00:04:08.090> to<00:04:08.240> the<00:04:08.360> realization<00:04:08.630> that

00:04:09.600 --> 00:04:09.610 
think I've come to the realization that

00:04:09.610 --> 00:04:13.270 
think I've come to the realization that
this<00:04:10.610> closet<00:04:11.360> gets<00:04:11.930> very<00:04:12.500> cluttered<00:04:12.890> very

00:04:13.270 --> 00:04:13.280 
this closet gets very cluttered very

00:04:13.280 --> 00:04:15.970 
this closet gets very cluttered very
quickly<00:04:13.580> so<00:04:14.240> it<00:04:14.510> needs<00:04:14.720> to<00:04:14.840> be<00:04:14.960> on<00:04:15.380> my<00:04:15.560> weekly

00:04:15.970 --> 00:04:15.980 
quickly so it needs to be on my weekly

00:04:15.980 --> 00:04:18.370 
quickly so it needs to be on my weekly
