00:00:02.860 --> 00:00:05.399
 Partisan leads I decided to show you 

00:00:05.399 --> 00:00:08.279
 how I work and at the same time show 

00:00:08.279 --> 00:00:09.959
 everything is pretty simple for anyone 

00:00:09.959 --> 00:00:11.319
 listed how to do it now 

00:00:11.319 --> 00:00:13.139
 tell and show 

00:00:13.139 --> 00:00:15.859
 look at it and take it 

00:00:15.859 --> 00:00:17.909
 such a camera 

00:00:17.909 --> 00:00:19.979
 the simplest household 

00:00:19.979 --> 00:00:21.249
 camera 

00:00:21.249 --> 00:00:24.720
 al fifi filmed from on this creams nexus 

00:00:24.720 --> 00:00:28.220
 120 arrest is almost the simplest and 

00:00:28.220 --> 00:00:31.060
 canadian eggs 

00:00:31.060 --> 00:00:33.300
 can shoot hd at the same time 

00:00:33.300 --> 00:00:36.060
 in personal capacity and in fact what is the secret 

00:00:36.060 --> 00:00:39.340
 that is, alko was different enough 

00:00:39.340 --> 00:00:41.060
 but I look bad 

00:00:41.060 --> 00:00:43.170
 the main thing to put the light 

00:00:43.170 --> 00:00:46.000
 it all changes cheap 

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:49.090
 this is such a halogen lamp 

00:00:49.090 --> 00:00:52.090
 that is, if you turn on 

00:00:52.600 --> 00:00:54.940
 output shines 

00:00:54.940 --> 00:00:57.400
 I passionately sheet Russia so after all 

00:00:57.400 --> 00:00:59.880
 Immediately and the noise disappears and you can love him 

00:00:59.880 --> 00:01:00.700
 to consider 

00:01:00.700 --> 00:01:02.900
 of course duel to buy a good light 

00:01:02.900 --> 00:01:05.020
 but it builds on a lot more money 

00:01:05.020 --> 00:01:06.560
 than he 

00:01:06.560 --> 00:01:07.410
 top 40 

00:01:07.410 --> 00:01:08.600
 device which 

00:01:08.600 --> 00:01:11.070
 with use for recording video from consoles 

00:01:11.070 --> 00:01:12.469
 so with the light for now 

00:01:12.469 --> 00:01:15.350
 and have to wait 

00:01:15.350 --> 00:01:17.890
 here it is special here I write down 

00:01:17.890 --> 00:01:20.880
 myself chizhov this 

00:01:20.880 --> 00:01:23.880
 Poles armchair so new color cut down 

00:01:27.910 --> 00:01:30.540
 By the way, you should immediately take off your computer 

00:01:30.540 --> 00:01:32.660
 that's actually imputed to programs 

00:01:32.660 --> 00:01:34.310
 in order to 

00:01:34.310 --> 00:01:36.510
 write granddaughter 

00:01:36.510 --> 00:01:38.760
 we soon turned out to be spelled 

00:01:38.760 --> 00:01:40.600
 tight console now on the body 

00:01:40.600 --> 00:01:42.950
 big fanciers goes for writing one 

00:01:42.950 --> 00:01:43.950
 fight 

00:01:43.950 --> 00:01:44.770
 that's actually 

00:01:44.770 --> 00:01:46.800
 console that loses 

00:01:46.800 --> 00:01:48.720
 I did the fastest 

00:01:48.720 --> 00:01:51.720
 clouds suv 

00:01:52.400 --> 00:01:54.590
 write down 

00:01:54.590 --> 00:01:56.410
 all this is necessary the device itself 

00:01:56.410 --> 00:01:57.930
 the device itself is utopia 

00:01:57.930 --> 00:01:59.180
 smartly magic 

00:01:59.180 --> 00:02:01.620
 US trends from the street 

00:02:01.620 --> 00:02:04.110
 but also included kucheruk pros up to pounds 

00:02:04.110 --> 00:02:07.170
 boxing and own laziness out on the Terek 

00:02:07.170 --> 00:02:10.059
 the shoulder of the court makes everything immediately imagine 

00:02:10.059 --> 00:02:12.709
 because to make you forgive me a sense 

00:02:12.709 --> 00:02:14.969
 here is a field beaten 3 0 

00:02:14.969 --> 00:02:16.669
 that's very cool 

00:02:16.669 --> 00:02:17.999
 byte signal 

00:02:17.999 --> 00:02:19.949
 we are computer 

00:02:19.949 --> 00:02:22.999
 and here I can write it down calmly 

00:02:22.999 --> 00:02:24.659
 then everything 

00:02:24.659 --> 00:02:26.679
 this is China 

00:02:26.679 --> 00:02:28.349
 two examples 

00:02:28.349 --> 00:02:30.709
 adobe premiere 

00:02:30.709 --> 00:02:33.149
 and proper 

00:02:33.149 --> 00:02:36.149
 mounting video 

00:02:39.249 --> 00:02:41.919
 this idea which already saw him create 

00:02:41.919 --> 00:02:43.939
 Deal new team role that soon 

00:02:43.939 --> 00:02:45.319
 will see 

00:02:45.319 --> 00:02:47.369
 that is, the question continues 

00:02:47.369 --> 00:02:48.679
 ski give 

00:02:48.679 --> 00:02:50.319
 just recorded everything right there 

00:02:50.319 --> 00:02:52.509
 mounted straight on the fly as you can see 

00:02:52.509 --> 00:02:54.489
 light and leave on such 

00:02:54.489 --> 00:02:56.739
 the box dismissed simulator 

00:02:56.739 --> 00:02:59.739
 because I just stupidly not sheep 

00:03:01.089 --> 00:03:03.689
 the same tripod for the camera 

00:03:03.689 --> 00:03:05.219
 by price 

00:03:05.219 --> 00:03:06.449
 for special 

00:03:06.449 --> 00:03:08.269
 so here it is 

00:03:08.269 --> 00:03:10.989
 happens as you can see everything but there is 

00:03:10.989 --> 00:03:13.139
 Of course, the composition of the five 

00:03:13.139 --> 00:03:14.209
 the choice 

00:03:14.209 --> 00:03:15.879
 fine computer 

00:03:15.879 --> 00:03:17.369
 about this edition 

00:03:17.369 --> 00:03:20.909
 hard tires are neutron worth injuries but I tell me 

00:03:20.909 --> 00:03:22.599
 it cost 40 thousand 

00:03:22.599 --> 00:03:24.749
 so that I can put a canopy on the floor 

00:03:24.749 --> 00:03:28.030
 koin mount percentage and 

00:03:28.030 --> 00:03:31.030
 so that the map was amazing so that 

00:03:31.030 --> 00:03:33.369
 m wonderful may card 

00:03:33.369 --> 00:03:34.849
 capture 

00:03:34.849 --> 00:03:36.109
 could work 

00:03:36.109 --> 00:03:39.499
 actually the capture card itself was worth 8 pieces 

00:03:39.499 --> 00:03:42.769
 Well, the light is in any economic jackdaw 

00:03:42.769 --> 00:03:45.689
 a penny worth I got a tank 

00:03:45.689 --> 00:03:48.179
 just have a reason 

00:03:48.179 --> 00:03:49.629
 expensive 

00:03:49.629 --> 00:03:52.349
 Here is a camera worth order too 

00:03:52.349 --> 00:03:53.649
 eight pieces 

00:03:53.649 --> 00:03:56.649
 I think it's a parade oz everyone has 

00:03:57.349 --> 00:03:59.819
 but so expensive but she may not 

00:03:59.819 --> 00:04:00.769
 would need 

00:04:00.769 --> 00:04:03.419
 so less teeth do you have 

00:04:03.419 --> 00:04:05.309
 I don't have a microphone in the cockpit either 

00:04:05.309 --> 00:04:06.989
 no, unfortunately 

00:04:06.989 --> 00:04:09.279
 to this camera why did they think like him not 

00:04:09.279 --> 00:04:11.979
 fits 

00:04:11.979 --> 00:04:14.179
 so that there is a normal sound to judge closer to 

00:04:14.179 --> 00:04:16.430
 faith and then everything will be good robber 

00:04:16.430 --> 00:04:18.319
 suggesting perfect little 

00:04:18.319 --> 00:04:21.439
 money her efforts can do in the club to the very 

00:04:21.439 --> 00:04:22.770
 Schmiedebach games 

00:04:22.770 --> 00:04:24.050
 how do you play 

00:04:24.050 --> 00:04:26.900
 and so it is difficult so 

00:04:26.900 --> 00:04:30.070
 so and creativity board in passivity 

00:04:30.070 --> 00:04:32.070
 which by the way has already been done was very 

00:04:32.070 --> 00:04:32.240
 interesting
