00:00:07.730 --> 00:00:07.740 
amazon.ca not really so much Amazon I

00:00:07.740 --> 00:00:11.540 
amazon.ca not really so much Amazon I
guess<00:00:08.220> just<00:00:08.880> that<00:00:09.179> the<00:00:09.469> like<00:00:10.469> the<00:00:10.500> prices<00:00:10.980> of

00:00:11.540 --> 00:00:11.550 
guess just that the like the prices of

00:00:11.550 --> 00:00:14.150 
guess just that the like the prices of
things<00:00:11.820> here<00:00:12.509> in<00:00:12.540> Canada<00:00:13.290> compared<00:00:13.830> to<00:00:14.040> the

00:00:14.150 --> 00:00:14.160 
things here in Canada compared to the

00:00:14.160 --> 00:00:19.279 
things here in Canada compared to the
u.s.<00:00:14.690> even<00:00:15.690> though<00:00:15.990> we<00:00:16.800> have<00:00:17.130> a<00:00:17.720> dollar<00:00:18.720> that's

00:00:19.279 --> 00:00:19.289 
u.s. even though we have a dollar that's

00:00:19.289 --> 00:00:24.340 
u.s. even though we have a dollar that's
pretty<00:00:19.710> much<00:00:19.920> on<00:00:20.279> par<00:00:20.310> with<00:00:21.140> the<00:00:22.140> US<00:00:22.529> dollar<00:00:22.890> I

00:00:24.340 --> 00:00:24.350 
pretty much on par with the US dollar I

00:00:24.350 --> 00:00:28.849 
pretty much on par with the US dollar I
figured<00:00:25.350> while<00:00:25.670> amazon.ca<00:00:27.859> amazon.com

00:00:28.849 --> 00:00:28.859 
figured while amazon.ca amazon.com

00:00:28.859 --> 00:00:31.450 
figured while amazon.ca amazon.com
should<00:00:29.220> be<00:00:29.429> pretty<00:00:29.820> much<00:00:30.000> the<00:00:30.060> same<00:00:30.480> price

00:00:31.450 --> 00:00:31.460 
should be pretty much the same price

00:00:31.460 --> 00:00:37.180 
should be pretty much the same price
might<00:00:32.460> be<00:00:32.669> a<00:00:32.700> buck<00:00:32.969> or<00:00:33.149> two<00:00:33.180> different<00:00:35.360> but

00:00:37.180 --> 00:00:37.190 
might be a buck or two different but

00:00:37.190 --> 00:00:42.260 
might be a buck or two different but
when<00:00:38.190> I<00:00:38.219> went<00:00:38.520> there<00:00:40.399> well<00:00:41.399> actually<00:00:41.760> you'll

00:00:42.260 --> 00:00:42.270 
when I went there well actually you'll

00:00:42.270 --> 00:00:45.260 
when I went there well actually you'll

00:00:45.270 --> 00:00:48.830 
see in the in the clap I I made a little
clip<00:00:45.690> of<00:00:45.899> of<00:00:46.739> the<00:00:47.610> difference<00:00:48.180> in<00:00:48.390> the<00:00:48.450> price

00:00:48.830 --> 00:00:48.840 
clip of of the difference in the price

00:00:48.840 --> 00:00:52.250 
clip of of the difference in the price

in<00:01:33.180> Canada<00:01:33.630> I<00:01:34.259> decided<00:01:35.130> that<00:01:35.340> I<00:01:35.520> would<00:01:35.670> check

00:01:36.140 --> 00:01:36.150 
in Canada I decided that I would check

00:01:36.150 --> 00:01:40.880 
in Canada I decided that I would check
the<00:01:36.450> Amazon<00:01:37.130> dot<00:01:38.130> see<00:01:38.520> a<00:01:39.380> website<00:01:40.380> because<00:01:40.770> I

00:01:40.880 --> 00:01:40.890 
the Amazon dot see a website because I

00:01:40.890 --> 00:01:43.880 
the Amazon dot see a website because I
don't<00:01:41.130> think<00:01:41.360> I'm<00:01:42.360> not<00:01:42.630> sure<00:01:42.689> about<00:01:43.170> this<00:01:43.619> but

00:01:43.880 --> 00:01:43.890

00:01:43.890 --> 00:01:46.940 
don't think I'm not sure about this but
I<00:01:43.920> don't<00:01:44.189> think<00:01:44.490> that<00:01:45.590> amazon.com<00:01:46.590> will

00:01:46.940 --> 00:01:46.950 
I don't think that amazon.com will

00:01:46.950 --> 00:01:51.800 
I don't think that amazon.com will
deliver<00:01:47.509> to<00:01:48.509> Canada<00:01:49.670> so<00:01:50.670> anyway<00:01:51.119> long<00:01:51.750> story

you just

00:02:12.880 --> 00:02:18.400 
you just
delete<00:02:13.880> the<00:02:14.800> OM<00:02:15.800> and<00:02:16.250> the.com<00:02:16.640> and<00:02:17.480> substitute

a dot CA and you go to

00:02:22.030 --> 00:02:25.180 
a dot CA and you go to
amazon.ca<00:02:23.030> there's<00:02:23.870> quite<00:02:24.350> a<00:02:24.380> big<00:02:24.680> difference

00:02:25.180 --> 00:02:25.190 
amazon.ca there's quite a big difference

00:02:25.190 --> 00:02:29.640 
amazon.ca there's quite a big difference
in<00:02:25.430> the<00:02:25.550> price<00:02:26.140> it<00:02:27.140> doesn't<00:02:27.590> seem<00:02:27.860> right

00:02:29.640 --> 00:02:29.650 
in the price it doesn't seem right

00:02:29.650 --> 00:02:32.080 
in the price it doesn't seem right
more<00:02:30.650> than<00:02:30.830> likely<00:02:31.100> they're<00:02:31.550> coming<00:02:31.970> from

00:02:32.080 --> 00:02:32.090 
more than likely they're coming from

00:02:32.090 --> 00:02:34.270 
more than likely they're coming from
different<00:02:32.180> sellers<00:02:32.930> and<00:02:33.380> things<00:02:33.680> like<00:02:33.980> that

00:02:34.270 --> 00:02:34.280 
different sellers and things like that

00:02:34.280 --> 00:02:38.490 
different sellers and things like that
but<00:02:34.610> still<00:02:35.680> it<00:02:36.680> still<00:02:37.070> doesn't<00:02:37.400> really

00:02:38.490 --> 00:02:38.500 
but still it still doesn't really

00:02:38.500 --> 00:02:41.680 
but still it still doesn't really
explain<00:02:39.500> the<00:02:39.940> like<00:02:40.940> that's<00:02:41.150> quite<00:02:41.540> an

00:02:41.680 --> 00:02:41.690 
explain the like that's quite an

00:02:41.690 --> 00:02:43.540 
explain the like that's quite an
outrageous<00:02:42.380> difference<00:02:42.920> in<00:02:43.130> the<00:02:43.250> price<00:02:43.520> of

00:02:43.540 --> 00:02:43.550 
outrageous difference in the price of

00:02:43.550 --> 00:02:49.780 
outrageous difference in the price of
this<00:02:43.850> thing<00:02:45.790> and<00:02:46.790> the<00:02:48.040> exchange<00:02:49.040> rate<00:02:49.430> doesn't

00:02:49.780 --> 00:02:49.790 
this thing and the exchange rate doesn't

00:02:49.790 --> 00:02:53.530 
this thing and the exchange rate doesn't
really<00:02:50.030> explain<00:02:51.020> anything<00:02:51.740> because<00:02:52.540> our

00:02:53.530 --> 00:02:53.540 
really explain anything because our

00:02:53.540 --> 00:02:56.770 
really explain anything because our
dollar<00:02:53.960> is<00:02:54.440> sometimes<00:02:55.400> worth<00:02:55.820> more<00:02:56.360> than<00:02:56.630> the

00:02:56.770 --> 00:02:56.780 
dollar is sometimes worth more than the

00:02:56.780 --> 00:03:02.730 
dollar is sometimes worth more than the
American<00:02:57.410> dollar<00:02:58.420> so<00:02:59.420> I<00:02:59.450> don't<00:02:59.960> get<00:03:00.260> it

00:03:02.730 --> 00:03:02.740 

00:03:02.740 --> 00:03:05.860 

but<00:03:03.740> anyway<00:03:04.190> I<00:03:04.430> won't<00:03:04.730> be<00:03:05.030> buying<00:03:05.240> it<00:03:05.630> that's

00:03:05.860 --> 00:03:05.870 
but anyway I won't be buying it that's

00:03:05.870 --> 00:03:08.140 
but anyway I won't be buying it that's
for<00:03:06.170> sure<00:03:06.350> I'll<00:03:06.620> try<00:03:06.830> to<00:03:06.980> find<00:03:07.310> it<00:03:07.520> on<00:03:07.640> eBay

00:03:08.140 --> 00:03:08.150 
for sure I'll try to find it on eBay
