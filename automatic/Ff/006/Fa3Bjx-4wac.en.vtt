truck it's got 260 thousand miles on it
I'm<00:00:09.389> going<00:00:09.780> to<00:00:09.900> show<00:00:10.050> you<00:00:10.080> how<00:00:10.349> to<00:00:10.410> replace<00:00:10.679> the

00:00:10.910 --> 00:00:10.920 
I'm going to show you how to replace the

00:00:10.920 --> 00:00:13.910 
I'm going to show you how to replace the
catalytic<00:00:11.429> converter<00:00:12.349> the<00:00:13.349> reason<00:00:13.679> why<00:00:13.830> I'm

00:00:13.910 --> 00:00:13.920 
catalytic converter the reason why I'm

00:00:13.920 --> 00:00:16.070 
catalytic converter the reason why I'm
replacing<00:00:14.099> the<00:00:14.490> catalytic<00:00:14.940> converter<00:00:15.080> is

00:00:16.070 --> 00:00:16.080 
replacing the catalytic converter is

00:00:16.080 --> 00:00:18.380 
replacing the catalytic converter is
it's<00:00:16.320> a<00:00:16.410> little<00:00:16.650> sluggish<00:00:17.160> going<00:00:17.940> up<00:00:18.090> hills

00:00:18.380 --> 00:00:18.390 
it's a little sluggish going up hills

00:00:18.390 --> 00:00:20.810 
it's a little sluggish going up hills
and<00:00:18.770> it's<00:00:19.770> a<00:00:19.830> little<00:00:20.039> underpowered<00:00:20.400> and

00:00:20.810 --> 00:00:20.820 
and it's a little underpowered and

00:00:20.820 --> 00:00:23.359 
and it's a little underpowered and
that's<00:00:21.300> a<00:00:21.420> symptom<00:00:21.840> of<00:00:21.960> a<00:00:22.560> bad<00:00:22.710> counter<00:00:22.949> so

00:00:23.359 --> 00:00:23.369 
that's a symptom of a bad counter so

00:00:23.369 --> 00:00:25.160 
that's a symptom of a bad counter so
that<00:00:23.400> you<00:00:23.910> can<00:00:24.060> pick<00:00:24.210> up<00:00:24.240> I<00:00:24.510> got<00:00:24.660> this<00:00:24.810> one<00:00:25.019> for

00:00:25.160 --> 00:00:25.170 
that you can pick up I got this one for

00:00:25.170 --> 00:00:28.480 
that you can pick up I got this one for
80<00:00:25.350> bucks<00:00:25.439> at<00:00:25.769> Pep<00:00:25.949> Boys<00:00:25.980> and<00:00:26.849> the<00:00:27.750> other

00:00:28.480 --> 00:00:28.490 
80 bucks at Pep Boys and the other

00:00:28.490 --> 00:00:32.240 
80 bucks at Pep Boys and the other
hardware<00:00:29.490> that<00:00:29.609> you'll<00:00:29.789> need<00:00:30.800> is<00:00:31.800> only<00:00:32.009> a<00:00:32.099> few

00:00:32.240 --> 00:00:32.250 
hardware that you'll need is only a few

00:00:32.250 --> 00:00:34.760 
hardware that you'll need is only a few
dollars<00:00:32.369> more<00:00:32.960> so<00:00:33.960> first<00:00:34.380> thing<00:00:34.530> we<00:00:34.620> need<00:00:34.739> to

00:00:34.760 --> 00:00:34.770 
dollars more so first thing we need to

00:00:34.770 --> 00:00:37.729 
dollars more so first thing we need to
do<00:00:34.980> is<00:00:35.790> cut<00:00:36.630> out<00:00:36.780> the<00:00:37.079> old<00:00:37.110> catalytic

00:00:37.729 --> 00:00:37.739 
do is cut out the old catalytic

00:00:37.739 --> 00:00:40.100 
do is cut out the old catalytic
converter<00:00:38.100> or<00:00:38.280> unbolt<00:00:38.760> the<00:00:39.570> old<00:00:39.690> catalytic

00:00:40.100 --> 00:00:40.110 
converter or unbolt the old catalytic

00:00:40.110 --> 00:00:41.240 
converter or unbolt the old catalytic
converter<00:00:40.379> here<00:00:40.559> we<00:00:40.649> are<00:00:40.680> underneath<00:00:41.100> the

00:00:41.240 --> 00:00:41.250 
converter here we are underneath the

00:00:41.250 --> 00:00:42.920 
converter here we are underneath the
truck<00:00:41.579> this<00:00:41.910> is<00:00:42.090> the<00:00:42.210> old<00:00:42.329> catalytic

00:00:42.920 --> 00:00:42.930 
truck this is the old catalytic

00:00:42.930 --> 00:00:45.740 
truck this is the old catalytic
converter<00:00:43.230> and<00:00:44.000> what<00:00:45.000> we'll<00:00:45.149> do<00:00:45.360> is<00:00:45.539> we'll

00:00:45.740 --> 00:00:45.750 
converter and what we'll do is we'll

00:00:45.750 --> 00:00:50.900 
converter and what we'll do is we'll
undo<00:00:46.469> those<00:00:46.620> clamps<00:00:48.800> and<00:00:49.800> then<00:00:50.280> there<00:00:50.610> should

00:00:50.900 --> 00:00:50.910 
undo those clamps and then there should

00:00:50.910 --> 00:00:54.529 
undo those clamps and then there should
have<00:00:50.940> been<00:00:51.059> a<00:00:51.210> clamp<00:00:51.600> there<00:00:53.180> and<00:00:54.180> I<00:00:54.270> have<00:00:54.510> a

00:00:54.529 --> 00:00:54.539 
have been a clamp there and I have a

00:00:54.539 --> 00:00:55.880 
have been a clamp there and I have a
feeling<00:00:55.020> that<00:00:55.140> I'm<00:00:55.260> probably<00:00:55.469> going<00:00:55.620> to<00:00:55.739> have

00:00:55.880 --> 00:00:55.890 
feeling that I'm probably going to have

00:00:55.890 --> 00:00:59.599 
feeling that I'm probably going to have
to<00:00:56.039> cut<00:00:56.280> that<00:00:57.199> cut<00:00:58.199> that<00:00:58.469> scene<00:00:59.219> where<00:00:59.489> that

00:00:59.599 --> 00:00:59.609 
to cut that cut that scene where that

00:00:59.609 --> 00:01:04.700 
to cut that cut that scene where that
joint<00:00:59.879> right<00:00:59.969> there<00:01:03.049> so<00:01:04.049> as<00:01:04.320> I<00:01:04.470> kind<00:01:04.680> of

00:01:04.700 --> 00:01:04.710 
joint right there so as I kind of

00:01:04.710 --> 00:01:06.560 
joint right there so as I kind of
anticipated<00:01:05.460> it<00:01:05.850> was<00:01:05.970> rusted<00:01:06.360> in<00:01:06.450> there

00:01:06.560 --> 00:01:06.570 
anticipated it was rusted in there

00:01:06.570 --> 00:01:08.240 
anticipated it was rusted in there
pretty<00:01:06.780> bad<00:01:06.960> end<00:01:07.200> up<00:01:07.350> having<00:01:07.590> a<00:01:07.650> sawzall<00:01:08.100> it

00:01:08.240 --> 00:01:08.250 
pretty bad end up having a sawzall it

00:01:08.250 --> 00:01:09.649 
pretty bad end up having a sawzall it
out<00:01:08.369> even<00:01:09.060> though<00:01:09.119> I<00:01:09.180> was<00:01:09.270> able<00:01:09.360> to<00:01:09.479> get<00:01:09.570> the

00:01:09.649 --> 00:01:09.659 
out even though I was able to get the

00:01:09.659 --> 00:01:13.219 
out even though I was able to get the
clamps<00:01:10.020> off<00:01:10.939> sawzall<00:01:11.939> made<00:01:12.479> quick<00:01:12.750> work<00:01:12.780> of

00:01:13.219 --> 00:01:13.229 
clamps off sawzall made quick work of

00:01:13.229 --> 00:01:18.560 
clamps off sawzall made quick work of
cutting<00:01:14.010> it<00:01:14.100> out<00:01:14.189> so<00:01:15.119> now<00:01:15.270> what<00:01:15.450> I'll<00:01:15.540> do<00:01:15.720> is<00:01:17.570> we

00:01:18.560 --> 00:01:18.570 
cutting it out so now what I'll do is we

00:01:18.570 --> 00:01:22.940 
cutting it out so now what I'll do is we
will<00:01:18.780> go<00:01:19.110> in<00:01:19.350> and<00:01:19.650> fit<00:01:21.290> the<00:01:22.290> new<00:01:22.470> catalytic

00:01:22.940 --> 00:01:22.950 
will go in and fit the new catalytic

00:01:22.950 --> 00:01:33.950 
will go in and fit the new catalytic
converter<00:01:30.320> with<00:01:31.320> its<00:01:31.590> little<00:01:32.810> extension<00:01:33.810> pipe

00:01:33.950 --> 00:01:33.960 
converter with its little extension pipe

00:01:33.960 --> 00:01:38.690 
converter with its little extension pipe
and<00:01:34.259> put<00:01:35.100> him<00:01:35.310> in<00:01:37.159> where<00:01:38.159> we<00:01:38.220> took<00:01:38.369> the<00:01:38.490> old<00:01:38.520> one

00:01:38.690 --> 00:01:38.700 
and put him in where we took the old one

00:01:38.700 --> 00:01:41.630 
and put him in where we took the old one
out<00:01:38.790> all<00:01:39.270> right<00:01:39.420> so<00:01:39.479> now<00:01:39.720> we're<00:01:39.900> fitting<00:01:40.640> the

00:01:41.630 --> 00:01:41.640 
out all right so now we're fitting the

00:01:41.640 --> 00:01:45.230 
out all right so now we're fitting the
new<00:01:41.759> catalytic<00:01:42.270> converter<00:01:43.909> this<00:01:44.909> little

00:01:45.230 --> 00:01:45.240 
new catalytic converter this little

00:01:45.240 --> 00:01:48.499 
new catalytic converter this little
filler<00:01:45.479> piece<00:01:45.810> and<00:01:46.700> what<00:01:47.700> I<00:01:47.729> need<00:01:47.939> to<00:01:48.060> do<00:01:48.210> is<00:01:48.420> I

00:01:48.499 --> 00:01:48.509 
filler piece and what I need to do is I

00:01:48.509 --> 00:01:52.280 
filler piece and what I need to do is I
need<00:01:48.570> to<00:01:48.689> cut<00:01:48.990> off<00:01:49.140> all<00:01:49.380> this<00:01:49.590> junk<00:01:51.079> see<00:01:52.079> that

00:01:52.280 --> 00:01:52.290 
need to cut off all this junk see that

00:01:52.290 --> 00:01:55.760 
need to cut off all this junk see that
all<00:01:52.530> that<00:01:52.649> junk<00:01:52.920> right<00:01:53.130> there<00:01:54.470> so<00:01:55.470> he<00:01:55.619> can

00:01:55.760 --> 00:01:55.770 
all that junk right there so he can

00:01:55.770 --> 00:01:57.560 
all that junk right there so he can
slide<00:01:56.009> over<00:01:56.250> that<00:01:56.399> pipe<00:01:56.579> so<00:01:57.090> I'll<00:01:57.210> cut<00:01:57.420> that

00:01:57.560 --> 00:01:57.570 
slide over that pipe so I'll cut that

00:01:57.570 --> 00:02:01.149 
slide over that pipe so I'll cut that
off<00:01:57.810> and<00:01:58.430> that'll<00:01:59.430> get<00:01:59.579> me<00:01:59.700> close<00:01:59.969> and<00:02:00.329> then<00:02:00.719> I

00:02:01.149 --> 00:02:01.159 
off and that'll get me close and then I

00:02:01.159 --> 00:02:05.149 
off and that'll get me close and then I
can<00:02:02.159> take<00:02:02.310> this<00:02:02.579> pipe<00:02:02.850> and<00:02:03.320> adjust<00:02:04.320> whatever<00:02:04.979> I

00:02:05.149 --> 00:02:05.159 
can take this pipe and adjust whatever I

00:02:05.159 --> 00:02:10.319 
can take this pipe and adjust whatever I
need<00:02:05.460> to<00:02:05.759> meet<00:02:06.540> the<00:02:06.689> Y<00:02:06.840> pipe<00:02:07.110> up<00:02:07.320> up<00:02:07.560> in<00:02:07.829> front

00:02:10.319 --> 00:02:10.329 

00:02:10.329 --> 00:02:14.559 

now<00:02:11.329> we<00:02:11.480> have<00:02:11.629> the<00:02:11.780> new<00:02:13.299> catalytic<00:02:14.299> converter

00:02:14.559 --> 00:02:14.569 
now we have the new catalytic converter

00:02:14.569 --> 00:02:18.270 
now we have the new catalytic converter
in<00:02:14.780> I<00:02:14.930> was<00:02:15.049> lucky<00:02:15.379> I<00:02:15.409> didn't<00:02:15.620> have<00:02:15.739> to<00:02:15.890> trim<00:02:16.189> I

00:02:18.270 --> 00:02:18.280 
in I was lucky I didn't have to trim I

00:02:18.280 --> 00:02:22.420 
in I was lucky I didn't have to trim I
didn't<00:02:19.280> have<00:02:19.370> to<00:02:19.459> trim<00:02:19.670> this<00:02:19.790> guy<00:02:20.030> at<00:02:20.840> all<00:02:21.430> my

00:02:22.420 --> 00:02:22.430 
didn't have to trim this guy at all my

00:02:22.430 --> 00:02:25.170 
didn't have to trim this guy at all my
cut<00:02:23.030> out<00:02:23.180> my<00:02:23.420> measurements<00:02:23.870> were<00:02:23.959> right<00:02:24.170> sound

00:02:25.170 --> 00:02:25.180 
cut out my measurements were right sound
