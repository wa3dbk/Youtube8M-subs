00:02:09.719 --> 00:02:09.729 
see it general idea I'm going to stretch

00:02:09.729 --> 00:02:11.190 
see it general idea I'm going to stretch
some<00:02:10.000> fabric<00:02:10.390> over<00:02:10.600> this<00:02:10.720> and<00:02:10.989> start

00:02:11.190 --> 00:02:11.200 
some fabric over this and start

00:02:11.200 --> 00:02:15.240 
some fabric over this and start
fiberglassing<00:02:13.860> then<00:02:14.860> I<00:02:14.890> got<00:02:15.040> them<00:02:15.130> both

00:02:15.240 --> 00:02:15.250 
fiberglassing then I got them both

00:02:15.250 --> 00:02:19.110 
fiberglassing then I got them both
mounted<00:02:15.640> up<00:02:15.730> to<00:02:15.819> the<00:02:15.989> floor<00:02:16.989> and<00:02:17.610> am<00:02:18.610> Soule<00:02:18.970> in

00:02:28.810 --> 00:02:30.360 
stretched over the amp rack we got it
all<00:02:28.900> stapled<00:02:29.319> down<00:02:29.349> and<00:02:29.650> tight<00:02:29.799> I'll<00:02:30.010> just<00:02:30.220> get

00:02:30.360 --> 00:02:30.370 
all stapled down and tight I'll just get

00:02:30.370 --> 00:02:32.009 
all stapled down and tight I'll just get
it<00:02:30.459> cut<00:02:30.610> off<00:02:30.700> the<00:02:30.819> echoed<00:02:31.330> off<00:02:31.450> all<00:02:31.599> the<00:02:31.690> excess

00:02:32.009 --> 00:02:32.019 
it cut off the echoed off all the excess

00:02:32.019 --> 00:02:34.949 
it cut off the echoed off all the excess
now<00:02:32.799> we're<00:02:32.890> gonna<00:02:32.980> start<00:02:33.160> fiberglassing<00:02:33.959> we

00:02:34.949 --> 00:02:34.959 
now we're gonna start fiberglassing we

00:02:34.959 --> 00:02:37.229 
now we're gonna start fiberglassing we
got<00:02:35.109> two<00:02:35.350> layers<00:02:35.530> of<00:02:35.709> resin<00:02:36.310> down<00:02:36.730> right<00:02:37.060> now

00:02:37.229 --> 00:02:37.239 
got two layers of resin down right now

00:02:37.239 --> 00:02:39.770 
got two layers of resin down right now
it's<00:02:37.900> getting<00:02:38.140> nice<00:02:38.260> and<00:02:38.290> hard

00:02:39.770 --> 00:02:39.780 
it's getting nice and hard

00:02:39.780 --> 00:02:44.370 
it's getting nice and hard
we're<00:02:40.780> gonna<00:02:40.930> fiberglass<00:02:41.500> it<00:02:41.709> up<00:02:41.829> and<00:02:43.380> I'm

00:02:44.370 --> 00:02:44.380 
we're gonna fiberglass it up and I'm

00:02:44.380 --> 00:02:46.380 
we're gonna fiberglass it up and I'm
thinking<00:02:44.440> only<00:02:44.799> need<00:02:45.040> one<00:02:45.160> layer<00:02:45.370> but<00:02:46.030> if<00:02:46.239> not

00:02:46.380 --> 00:02:46.390 
thinking only need one layer but if not

00:02:46.390 --> 00:02:48.509 
thinking only need one layer but if not
we'll<00:02:46.540> do<00:02:46.690> two<00:02:46.890> and<00:02:47.890> we'll<00:02:48.160> check<00:02:48.280> back<00:02:48.340> in

00:02:48.509 --> 00:02:48.519 
we'll do two and we'll check back in

00:02:48.519 --> 00:02:52.210 
we'll do two and we'll check back in
after<00:02:48.850> that

00:02:52.210 --> 00:02:52.220 

00:02:52.220 --> 00:02:54.940 

we<00:02:52.700> down<00:02:52.910> some<00:02:53.120> at<00:02:53.500> the<00:02:54.500> show<00:02:54.680> a<00:02:54.710> little

00:02:54.940 --> 00:02:54.950 
we down some at the show a little

00:02:54.950 --> 00:02:58.940 
we down some at the show a little
freaked<00:02:55.160> out

00:02:58.940 --> 00:02:58.950 

00:02:58.950 --> 00:03:09.119 

slapping<00:02:59.760> down<00:02:59.879> that<00:03:00.120> risen

00:03:09.119 --> 00:03:09.129 

00:03:09.129 --> 00:03:12.449 

rolls<00:03:09.700> on<00:03:09.879> fiberglassing<00:03:11.010> pretty<00:03:12.010> ugly<00:03:12.159> right

00:03:12.449 --> 00:03:12.459 
rolls on fiberglassing pretty ugly right

00:03:12.459 --> 00:03:15.649 
rolls on fiberglassing pretty ugly right
now<00:03:12.519> but<00:03:13.319> we'll<00:03:14.319> make<00:03:14.500> our<00:03:14.620> birdie

00:03:15.649 --> 00:03:15.659 
now but we'll make our birdie

00:03:15.659 --> 00:03:18.839 
now but we'll make our birdie
let<00:03:16.659> it<00:03:16.750> dry<00:03:16.959> overnight<00:03:17.310> working<00:03:18.310> on<00:03:18.459> it<00:03:18.640> again

00:03:18.839 --> 00:03:18.849 
let it dry overnight working on it again

00:03:18.849 --> 00:03:21.620 
let it dry overnight working on it again
tomorrow

00:03:21.620 --> 00:03:21.630 

00:03:21.630 --> 00:03:25.430 

so<00:03:22.230> first<00:03:22.530> layer<00:03:22.710> of<00:03:22.740> bondo<00:03:23.160> is<00:03:23.370> done<00:03:23.760> a<00:03:24.440> little

00:03:25.430 --> 00:03:25.440 
so first layer of bondo is done a little

00:03:25.440 --> 00:03:29.000 
so first layer of bondo is done a little
messy<00:03:26.060> but<00:03:27.060> it's<00:03:27.600> alright<00:03:27.900> I'm<00:03:28.560> going<00:03:28.710> to<00:03:28.770> sand

00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:29.010 
messy but it's alright I'm going to sand

00:03:29.010 --> 00:03:30.410 
messy but it's alright I'm going to sand
it<00:03:29.100> down<00:03:29.160> I'll<00:03:29.550> probably<00:03:29.730> have<00:03:29.910> to<00:03:29.970> go<00:03:30.090> over<00:03:30.300> it

00:03:30.410 --> 00:03:30.420 
it down I'll probably have to go over it

00:03:30.420 --> 00:03:32.510 
it down I'll probably have to go over it
one<00:03:31.170> or<00:03:31.290> two<00:03:31.320> more<00:03:31.560> times<00:03:31.770> to<00:03:31.950> make<00:03:32.160> sure<00:03:32.310> I<00:03:32.340> got

00:03:32.510 --> 00:03:32.520 
one or two more times to make sure I got

00:03:32.520 --> 00:03:36.850 
one or two more times to make sure I got
every<00:03:32.880> spot<00:03:33.150> make<00:03:33.480> it<00:03:33.600> nice<00:03:33.720> and<00:03:33.750> smooth<00:03:34.110> but

00:03:36.850 --> 00:03:36.860 

00:03:36.860 --> 00:03:38.840 

after<00:03:37.860> that<00:03:37.980> it's<00:03:38.160> on<00:03:38.250> to<00:03:38.310> priming<00:03:38.760> and

00:03:38.840 --> 00:03:38.850 
after that it's on to priming and

00:03:38.850 --> 00:03:43.760 
after that it's on to priming and
painting<00:03:41.690> did<00:03:42.690> a<00:03:42.750> few<00:03:42.870> layers<00:03:43.080> of<00:03:43.410> primer

00:03:43.760 --> 00:03:43.770 
painting did a few layers of primer

00:03:43.770 --> 00:03:46.640 
painting did a few layers of primer
sanded<00:03:44.340> it<00:03:44.400> down<00:03:44.460> and<00:03:44.990> now<00:03:45.990> I'm<00:03:46.110> about<00:03:46.200> a<00:03:46.350> can

00:03:46.640 --> 00:03:46.650 
sanded it down and now I'm about a can

00:03:46.650 --> 00:03:51.360 
sanded it down and now I'm about a can
and<00:03:46.800> a<00:03:46.860> half<00:03:47.040> into<00:03:47.250> the<00:03:47.430> black

00:03:51.360 --> 00:03:51.370 

00:03:51.370 --> 00:03:54.910 

looking<00:03:52.370> pretty<00:03:52.459> good<00:03:52.609> so<00:03:52.730> far<00:03:53.329> I<00:03:53.859> think<00:03:54.859> I

00:03:54.910 --> 00:03:54.920 
looking pretty good so far I think I

00:03:54.920 --> 00:03:56.080 
looking pretty good so far I think I
might<00:03:55.069> have<00:03:55.129> to<00:03:55.249> pick<00:03:55.370> up<00:03:55.519> another<00:03:55.790> can<00:03:56.060> of

00:03:56.080 --> 00:03:56.090 
might have to pick up another can of

00:03:56.090 --> 00:03:57.910 
might have to pick up another can of
black<00:03:56.329> we'll<00:03:56.599> find<00:03:56.810> out<00:03:56.930> as<00:03:57.079> ice<00:03:57.230> and<00:03:57.499> if<00:03:57.769> any

00:03:57.910 --> 00:03:57.920 
black we'll find out as ice and if any

00:03:57.920 --> 00:04:00.879 
black we'll find out as ice and if any
gray<00:03:58.159> shows<00:03:58.459> through<00:03:59.019> and<00:04:00.019> then<00:04:00.620> it's<00:04:00.739> on<00:04:00.859> to

00:04:00.879 --> 00:04:00.889 
gray shows through and then it's on to

00:04:00.889 --> 00:04:19.360 
gray shows through and then it's on to
the<00:04:01.069> clear<00:04:01.280> coat

00:04:19.360 --> 00:04:19.370 

00:04:19.370 --> 00:04:22.870 

Oh

00:04:22.870 --> 00:04:22.880
