 they learn how to walk down the street and 

00:00:20.380 --> 00:00:25.020
 they start to ride a bicycle 

00:00:22.830 --> 00:00:25.980
 so that they move safely and 

00:00:25.020 --> 00:00:27.420
 healthy 

00:00:25.980 --> 00:00:30.300
 Below are some 

00:00:27.420 --> 00:00:32.669
 recommendations teach them to cross 

00:00:30.300 --> 00:00:34.800
 always by safe places steps of 

00:00:32.669 --> 00:00:37.489

00:00:50.129 --> 00:00:56.109
 the hand of an adult person 

00:00:53.460 --> 00:00:58.570
 Teach them not to play around or behind 

00:00:56.109 --> 00:01:00.430
 of vehicles or in the garages to cross 

00:00:58.570 --> 00:01:02.890
 at least three meters in front of a 

00:01:00.430 --> 00:01:07.150
 car and get away as soon as they get in 

00:01:02.890 --> 00:01:09.130
 dangerous march backwards due to 

00:01:07.150 --> 00:01:11.110
 his height the boys and girls more 

00:01:09.130 --> 00:01:13.450
 small ones become invisible to 

00:01:11.110 --> 00:01:15.140
 driver especially if they are very close 

00:01:13.450 --> 00:01:17.180
 or behind 

00:01:15.140 --> 00:01:19.820
 Teach them to leave bicycles 

00:01:17.180 --> 00:01:22.040
 scooters or toys off the driveway 

00:01:19.820 --> 00:01:24.830
 and play in suitable places for it 

00:01:22.040 --> 00:01:26.570
 so it's gardens not on the sidewalk 

00:01:24.830 --> 00:01:29.170
 nor in the road even if it is little 

00:01:26.570 --> 00:01:29.170
 busy 

00:01:30.070 --> 00:01:34.000
 when a ball invades the road 

00:01:32.020 --> 00:01:36.670
 it can be the prelude to an outrage 

00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:39.430
 since a child can appear 

00:01:36.670 --> 00:01:41.050
 then to recover it use 

00:01:39.430 --> 00:01:44.140
 reflective materials on the bicycle 

00:01:41.050 --> 00:01:45.470
 Children's chair backpack clothes to go to 

00:01:44.140 --> 00:01:48.320
 school 

00:01:45.470 --> 00:01:50.390
 it is advisable to make ourselves visible with 

00:01:48.320 --> 00:01:52.640
 reflective whether we are pedestrians 

00:01:50.390 --> 00:01:55.730
 as if we are cyclists especially 

00:01:52.640 --> 00:01:57.530
 when the visibility is low the helmet 

00:01:55.730 --> 00:02:00.470
 correctly fastened to mount in 

00:01:57.530 --> 00:02:04.040
 skateboard or ski bike reduces between 

00:02:00.470 --> 00:02:06.550
 45 and 75% trauma 

00:02:04.040 --> 00:02:06.550
 cranial
