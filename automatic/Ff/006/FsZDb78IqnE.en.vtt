00:00:14.870 --> 00:00:16.899
 My name is Gareth. Gareth Bale. 

00:00:17.555 --> 00:00:21.065
 I'm a new real player. Teams from Spain. 

00:00:22.078 --> 00:00:24.965
 Spain as a box of chocolates. 

00:00:25.401 --> 00:00:28.105
 Some with liquor. 

00:00:29.645 --> 00:00:32.469
 You British are much chatting when you come to Salou 

00:00:32.842 --> 00:00:34.028
 Mr florentino 

00:00:35.027 --> 00:00:41.690
 Why do people say that 100 million is immoral for me? 

00:00:42.156 --> 00:00:49.757
 So said before. After they saw your game against Atletico, they say that buying Bail is just stupid 

00:00:50.020 --> 00:00:51.812
 Dullness makes dumbass 

00:00:52.436 --> 00:00:56.041
 Call me stupid. First Kaka, now you 

00:00:56.992 --> 00:00:57.882
 I did not learn the lesson 

00:00:59.474 --> 00:01:06.886
 Forrest, I will walk by the pond. At this time, I usually feed ducks with 500 euro notes. 

00:01:10.220 --> 00:01:12.500
 My name is Gareth. Gareth Bale 

00:01:12.500 --> 00:01:16.617
 I know! You are one of the reasons for the defeat of Atletico. 

00:01:16.993 --> 00:01:20.227
 Because the players are guilty, not the coach, right? 

00:01:22.953 --> 00:01:25.196
 Although it seems impossible ... 

00:01:25.741 --> 00:01:28.316
 even I played badly! 

00:01:29.455 --> 00:01:33.970
 What really seems impossible is that you admit it. 

00:01:34.604 --> 00:01:35.807
 Are you kidding me? 

00:01:36.230 --> 00:01:37.789
 What does "mock" mean? 

00:01:38.535 --> 00:01:40.142
 What a cheap moron! 

00:01:40.453 --> 00:01:42.033
 Although not so cheap 

00:01:42.263 --> 00:01:43.572
 But freak 

00:01:43.921 --> 00:01:48.271
 Listen, you're in real life. Now only my name is important to you. 

00:01:48.602 --> 00:01:51.645
 Hey, you! Give me a close up 

00:01:53.781 --> 00:01:57.113
 My name is Cristiano. Cristiano Ronaldo. 

00:01:57.536 --> 00:02:00.285
 My mother always said that I was like a box of chocolates. 

00:02:00.285 --> 00:02:01.826
 Same sweet 

00:02:02.701 --> 00:02:04.087
 Once in Portugal ... 

00:02:04.087 --> 00:02:06.461
 Hey! Hey! What are you doing cheap? 

00:02:06.461 --> 00:02:11.500
 Hey, Florentino! Sketch is not about me! 

00:02:14.788 --> 00:02:17.597
 Real Madrid is such a weird club 

00:02:18.428 --> 00:02:22.173
 Lieutenant! Despite the fact that you do not believe me, I run fast, like the wind. 

00:02:22.173 --> 00:02:26.860
 Good. This is exactly what I wanted to talk to you about. 

00:02:26.860 --> 00:02:29.250
 Sit down and calm down 

00:02:30.519 --> 00:02:34.340
 Do you think you'll run to London? 

00:02:36.678 --> 00:02:37.897
 Of course, Lt. Carlo. 

00:02:38.392 --> 00:02:40.217
 Fine. Then go ahead. 

00:02:40.217 --> 00:02:47.550
 Get up! I want you to run to the Arsenal base and give us Ozila back. 

00:02:47.550 --> 00:02:48.782
 How do you say, Lieutenant Carlo! 

00:02:48.782 --> 00:02:50.892
 Come on, come on 

00:02:50.892 --> 00:02:52.306
 Run, Gareth, run! 

00:02:52.306 --> 00:02:55.114
 Do not look at me! Run!
