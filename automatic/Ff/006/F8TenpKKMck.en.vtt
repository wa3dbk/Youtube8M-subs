00:00:15.910 --> 00:00:22.340
 hello everyone is kiki punk and 

00:00:18.830 --> 00:00:24.560
 we find ourselves for a step one of my 

00:00:22.340 --> 00:00:27.080
 creations from elsewhere it's a creation 

00:00:24.560 --> 00:00:29.930
 from dance to games so the creator of 

00:00:27.080 --> 00:00:33.080
 the zephyr plane so one that had created 

00:00:29.930 --> 00:00:38.199
 the plane before and did not have any 

00:00:33.080 --> 00:00:40.519
 his subject and who made software of 

00:00:38.199 --> 00:00:42.830
 someone in made a somone software 

00:00:40.519 --> 00:00:46.250
 game since he did two and he took out 

00:00:42.830 --> 00:00:49.280
 something that is close to what we have 

00:00:46.250 --> 00:00:51.799
 done with bret to display a score in 

00:00:49.280 --> 00:00:53.870
 top of the screen or whatever he did his 

00:00:51.799 --> 00:00:55.369
 thanks is order so have I I 

00:00:53.870 --> 00:00:57.170
 wanted to do that it seemed to me roll for 

00:00:55.369 --> 00:00:57.589
 the abc when you have a dragon 

00:00:57.170 --> 00:00:59.629
 noise 

00:00:57.589 --> 00:01:01.940
 him he found a way that is 

00:00:59.629 --> 00:01:02.930
 totally a beast but that's 

00:01:01.940 --> 00:01:04.699
 totally logical 

00:01:02.930 --> 00:01:08.390
 in addition it poses no problem of ram 

00:01:04.699 --> 00:01:10.790
 or else it allows tea actually is 

00:01:08.390 --> 00:01:12.619
 teleports the dragon andor in fact to 

00:01:10.790 --> 00:01:15.740
 each time with each shame cycle and 

00:01:12.619 --> 00:01:18.230
 will carry hinges to 10000 notepad mapfre 

00:01:15.740 --> 00:01:20.560
 to gmail steam punk you can you tp to 

00:01:18.230 --> 00:01:22.850
 10000 block in another direction 

00:01:20.560 --> 00:01:24.530
 so every time talent in a world 

00:01:22.850 --> 00:01:25.640
 finally complain the advantage of 

00:01:24.530 --> 00:01:27.290
 the Andorran dragon is that the bar 

00:01:25.640 --> 00:01:28.670
 appears anywhere you look 

00:01:27.290 --> 00:01:30.860
 unlike the izards you have to 

00:01:28.670 --> 00:01:31.490
 look at the viewfinder so I'm going to launch 

00:01:30.860 --> 00:01:34.640
 the clock 

00:01:31.490 --> 00:01:37.700
 that's it's spying an order is 

00:01:34.640 --> 00:01:39.860
 come down as you see the blister 

00:01:37.700 --> 00:01:42.650
 begins to go down from elsewhere it's 

00:01:39.860 --> 00:01:45.580
 a blister 2 yeah that's all about 

00:01:42.650 --> 00:01:45.580
 second but he did 

00:01:46.020 --> 00:01:50.899
 there are very few bugs as you see 

00:01:48.210 --> 00:01:56.159
 it sounds like euros answers here 

00:01:50.899 --> 00:01:58.159
 I like distant and that the tp all the 

00:01:56.159 --> 00:02:01.289
 every two seconds 

00:01:58.159 --> 00:02:03.780
 there are some lags yet but would 

00:02:01.289 --> 00:02:06.209
 rather it works pretty well 

00:02:03.780 --> 00:02:09.330
 I think we will have to review the deadlines 

00:02:06.209 --> 00:02:11.989
 but with good deadlines I think that 

00:02:09.330 --> 00:02:15.660
 it's just perfect actually 

00:02:11.989 --> 00:02:18.299
 besides something that I have to try 

00:02:15.660 --> 00:02:21.440
 am I going to put out the blister I'm going to extinguish 

00:02:18.299 --> 00:02:21.440
 first is the bailiff 

00:02:25.940 --> 00:02:32.959
 I expect that's just for this one 

00:02:30.090 --> 00:02:32.959
 tried after 

00:02:47.090 --> 00:02:55.340
 but good tp order to the end i'm going to 

00:02:52.110 --> 00:02:55.340
 put four types 

00:02:58.579 --> 00:03:03.450
 for that we are well see it not for 

00:03:01.200 --> 00:03:13.920
 it's time to see I'm going 

00:03:03.450 --> 00:03:15.269
 rather put here that's so I'm you 

00:03:13.920 --> 00:03:19.319
 explain right after what I'm going 

00:03:15.269 --> 00:03:23.389
 do so we tp in black dragon do I 

00:03:19.319 --> 00:03:23.389
 know a miss 

00:03:26.500 --> 00:03:40.000
 pam since will see their tp you tp I 

00:03:34.540 --> 00:03:46.209
 do not know so we're going to call it we're going 

00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:53.970
 call it test a test an elected one will have to 

00:03:46.209 --> 00:03:53.970
 to be called test the test 2 

00:03:55.090 --> 00:04:04.609
 2 

00:03:56.930 --> 00:04:09.950
 So here is a test toc nickel bah 

00:04:04.609 --> 00:04:11.810
 therefore works a better way than his 

00:04:09.950 --> 00:04:13.609
 system instead of putting a slap that 

00:04:11.810 --> 00:04:15.829
 if you put in every fault of 

00:04:13.609 --> 00:04:16.820
 orders the ops glottal so the first 

00:04:15.829 --> 00:04:19.870
 blacks orders actually it's always 

00:04:16.820 --> 00:04:22.669
 wanted already shown her in a video 

00:04:19.870 --> 00:04:25.250
 and when we block we have a man tries 

00:04:22.669 --> 00:04:32.960
 an order by France will be better 

00:04:25.250 --> 00:04:35.479
 passive house but I try two and 

00:04:32.960 --> 00:04:37.729
 three weeks when the round button 

00:04:35.479 --> 00:04:38.750
 middle you have you see that it does 

00:04:37.729 --> 00:04:42.349
 2 3 1 

00:04:38.750 --> 00:04:47.030
 so the first I will resume as 

00:04:42.349 --> 00:04:49.699
 I did in my videos make 

00:04:47.030 --> 00:04:54.020
 diam's so the first one is 8 middle 

00:04:49.699 --> 00:04:55.699
 after that it's the bottom one and he 

00:04:54.020 --> 00:04:57.979
 god you so as you see it does 

00:04:55.699 --> 00:04:59.570
 two three so that will always do that 

00:04:57.979 --> 00:04:59.990
 was like that it was not 

00:04:59.570 --> 00:05:01.940
 other 

00:04:59.990 --> 00:05:05.630
 there is an order that is perfectly normal 

00:05:01.940 --> 00:05:08.930
 but there is so if we put him in the middle 

00:05:05.630 --> 00:05:11.510
 so he who is direct machine and who 

00:05:08.930 --> 00:05:13.580
 is live fed in tp and after one 

00:05:11.510 --> 00:05:15.860
 do this pony like they do not do it at the same time 

00:05:13.580 --> 00:05:18.650
 time that's good control it's 

00:05:15.860 --> 00:05:21.500
 just one thing had to test so that's it 

00:05:18.650 --> 00:05:24.620
 I hope you enjoyed this video 

00:05:21.500 --> 00:05:26.830
 by the way, just a test is 10 

00:05:24.620 --> 00:05:26.830
 minutes 

00:05:27.030 --> 00:05:29.870
 hop 

00:05:33.169 --> 00:05:36.310
 I found 58 

00:05:37.430 --> 00:05:39.790
 5 

00:05:41.560 --> 00:05:47.150
 I'm fine I'll leave you Coy 

00:05:45.680 --> 00:05:48.319
 nothing to this video this is 

00:05:47.150 --> 00:05:49.970
 career following this video 

00:05:48.319 --> 00:05:53.860
 if there is anything I will have 

00:05:49.970 --> 00:05:57.500
 modified to besson his system for 

00:05:53.860 --> 00:05:58.250
 improve it to the next and we get 

00:05:57.500 --> 00:06:01.759
 finds 

00:05:58.250 --> 00:06:04.400
 I finished so I made a counter 2 

00:06:01.759 --> 00:06:04.669
 minutes 40 you'll see it I'm going to the 

00:06:04.400 --> 00:06:07.340
 launch 

00:06:04.669 --> 00:06:09.319
 so here is the minute that 

00:06:07.340 --> 00:06:11.300
 long pass of aragon it is done 

00:06:09.319 --> 00:06:14.240
 deport every time so how 

00:06:11.300 --> 00:06:16.789
 I did this to him from the bottom tp name of a 

00:06:14.240 --> 00:06:19.430
 dragon the idiot Orpheus knows one to 

00:06:16.789 --> 00:06:22.430
 every time I removed two cravings for 

00:06:19.430 --> 00:06:26.539
 that the bar duos drop and I colored 

00:06:22.430 --> 00:06:31.430
 finally it's done the weather 

00:06:26.539 --> 00:06:35.539
 staying so I had fun 26.5 

00:06:31.430 --> 00:06:36.400
 points of 4,22 so my system I 

00:06:35.539 --> 00:06:39.050
 would not say it's better 

00:06:36.400 --> 00:06:39.680
 voila mail advantage is that I do 

00:06:39.050 --> 00:06:43.970
 every second 

00:06:39.680 --> 00:06:45.289
 and there is no problem sorry for 

00:06:43.970 --> 00:06:49.000
 screen displays while there he 

00:06:45.289 --> 00:06:52.970
 flashed on him two anthem daggers 

00:06:49.000 --> 00:06:57.610
 here we are going to let the minute pass 

00:06:52.970 --> 00:06:57.610
 rest you show yourself had fun 

00:06:58.610 --> 00:07:06.050
 7 so I made a minute 40 for a minute. 

00:07:02.780 --> 00:07:08.479
 reason the dragon agreement at 202 points 

00:07:06.050 --> 00:07:11.090
 life finally heartless but like that in 

00:07:08.479 --> 00:07:12.770
 2015 it's two bonds of life and if 

00:07:11.090 --> 00:07:18.379
 we make a minute 40 

00:07:12.770 --> 00:07:20.150
 it's equal to 100 seconds I took 100 

00:07:18.379 --> 00:07:22.430
 seconds because it's easier 

00:07:20.150 --> 00:07:23.930
 I had like that I finally divided them 

00:07:22.430 --> 00:07:25.099
 I do at least two each time otherwise 

00:07:23.930 --> 00:07:27.770
 must issue commas and all 

00:07:25.099 --> 00:07:29.650
 excerpts you'll be was boring that I 

00:07:27.770 --> 00:07:31.580
 go slightly lazy anyway 

00:07:29.650 --> 00:07:37.849
 I may have created a filter for 

00:07:31.580 --> 00:07:39.110
 do that I'm going to drink so there we see 

00:07:37.849 --> 00:07:44.199
 although it's actually in orange 

00:07:39.110 --> 00:07:46.180
 for thirty seconds all very 

00:07:44.199 --> 00:07:54.699
 say 

00:07:46.180 --> 00:07:58.840
 9 8 7 5 4 3 2 1 

00:07:54.699 --> 00:08:00.699
 and then after they have so here is 

00:07:58.840 --> 00:08:02.560
 I hope you enjoyed this video 

00:08:00.699 --> 00:08:06.389
 we'll meet again next time 

00:08:02.560 --> 00:08:06.389
 a new video at the next
