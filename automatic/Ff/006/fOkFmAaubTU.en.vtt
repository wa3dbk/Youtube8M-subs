you can see and it does like a few paint
details<00:05:50.639> but<00:05:51.270> that's<00:05:51.539> minor<00:05:53.060> and<00:05:55.339> of<00:05:56.339> course

00:05:57.050 --> 00:05:57.060 
details but that's minor and of course

00:05:57.060 --> 00:06:01.249 
details but that's minor and of course
the<00:05:57.509> back<00:05:58.099> we<00:05:59.099> have<00:05:59.449> the<00:06:00.449> piece<00:06:00.689> that<00:06:00.719> allows

00:06:01.249 --> 00:06:01.259 
the back we have the piece that allows

00:06:01.259 --> 00:06:05.420 
the back we have the piece that allows
us<00:06:01.289> to<00:06:02.029> mix<00:06:03.029> and<00:06:03.240> match<00:06:03.479> so<00:06:04.229> we<00:06:04.740> could<00:06:04.949> take<00:06:05.189> the

00:06:05.420 --> 00:06:05.430 
us to mix and match so we could take the

00:06:05.430 --> 00:06:11.119 
us to mix and match so we could take the
grill<00:06:05.849> arms<00:06:06.389> the<00:06:07.139> cheetah<00:06:07.589> legs<00:06:07.939> and<00:06:09.830> the<00:06:10.830> talk

00:06:11.119 --> 00:06:11.129 
grill arms the cheetah legs and the talk

00:06:11.129 --> 00:06:13.070 
grill arms the cheetah legs and the talk
ahead<00:06:11.580> and<00:06:11.939> make<00:06:12.300> a<00:06:12.330> completely<00:06:12.930> new

00:06:13.070 --> 00:06:13.080 
ahead and make a completely new

00:06:13.080 --> 00:06:17.749 
ahead and make a completely new
combination<00:06:13.830> if<00:06:14.039> you<00:06:14.099> wanted<00:06:15.050> and<00:06:16.460> we<00:06:17.460> can<00:06:17.610> do

00:06:17.749 --> 00:06:17.759 
combination if you wanted and we can do

00:06:17.759 --> 00:06:19.939 
combination if you wanted and we can do
this<00:06:17.969> of<00:06:18.210> course<00:06:18.240> with<00:06:18.839> all<00:06:19.110> the<00:06:19.469> figures<00:06:19.620> in

00:06:19.939 --> 00:06:19.949 
this of course with all the figures in

00:06:19.949 --> 00:06:24.769 
this of course with all the figures in
the<00:06:20.039> line<00:06:20.250> and<00:06:23.180> personally<00:06:24.180> I<00:06:24.210> think<00:06:24.330> that

00:06:24.769 --> 00:06:24.779 
the line and personally I think that

00:06:24.779 --> 00:06:27.019 
the line and personally I think that
these<00:06:24.900> figures<00:06:25.319> are<00:06:25.560> great<00:06:25.919> if<00:06:26.639> you're<00:06:26.789> going

00:06:27.019 --> 00:06:27.029 
these figures are great if you're going

00:06:27.029 --> 00:06:28.999 
these figures are great if you're going
to<00:06:27.089> get<00:06:27.300> figures<00:06:27.870> for<00:06:28.199> the<00:06:28.319> common<00:06:28.620> writers

00:06:28.999 --> 00:06:29.009 
to get figures for the common writers

00:06:29.009 --> 00:06:31.779 
to get figures for the common writers
line<00:06:29.279> I<00:06:29.310> definitely<00:06:29.819> recommend<00:06:30.089> the<00:06:30.539> occ<00:06:31.199> line

00:06:31.779 --> 00:06:31.789 
line I definitely recommend the occ line

00:06:31.789 --> 00:06:35.610 
line I definitely recommend the occ line
they<00:06:32.789> are<00:06:32.849> all<00:06:33.060> mix-and-match<00:06:33.959> compatible

00:06:35.610 --> 00:06:35.620 
they are all mix-and-match compatible

00:06:35.620 --> 00:06:38.700 
they are all mix-and-match compatible
and<00:06:36.210> they<00:06:37.210> have<00:06:37.360> very<00:06:37.389> high<00:06:37.780> level<00:06:38.229> of<00:06:38.320> detail

00:06:38.700 --> 00:06:38.710 
and they have very high level of detail

00:06:38.710 --> 00:06:41.490 
and they have very high level of detail
and<00:06:38.949> I<00:06:39.880> think<00:06:40.120> it's<00:06:40.240> compatible<00:06:40.570> with<00:06:40.870> the<00:06:41.020> SH

00:06:41.490 --> 00:06:41.500 
and I think it's compatible with the SH

00:06:41.500 --> 00:06:43.830 
and I think it's compatible with the SH
figuarts<00:06:42.160> now<00:06:42.580> of<00:06:42.729> course<00:06:42.790> the<00:06:43.090> SH<00:06:43.389> figuarts

00:06:43.830 --> 00:06:43.840 
figuarts now of course the SH figuarts

00:06:43.840 --> 00:06:46.740 
figuarts now of course the SH figuarts
will<00:06:44.050> have<00:06:44.199> more<00:06:44.620> accessories<00:06:45.310> with<00:06:45.610> them<00:06:45.790> but

00:06:46.740 --> 00:06:46.750 
will have more accessories with them but

00:06:46.750 --> 00:06:48.030 
will have more accessories with them but
you're<00:06:47.110> not<00:06:47.260> going<00:06:47.440> to<00:06:47.500> have<00:06:47.650> this<00:06:47.800> added

00:06:48.030 --> 00:06:48.040 
you're not going to have this added

00:06:48.040 --> 00:06:50.159 
you're not going to have this added
playability<00:06:48.610> of<00:06:48.880> being<00:06:49.240> able<00:06:49.360> to<00:06:49.510> change<00:06:49.930> the

00:06:50.159 --> 00:06:50.169 
playability of being able to change the

00:06:50.169 --> 00:06:53.340 
playability of being able to change the
combos<00:06:50.650> like<00:06:50.800> you<00:06:51.130> do<00:06:51.310> here<00:06:51.669> so<00:06:52.389> that's<00:06:53.229> going

00:06:53.340 --> 00:06:53.350 
combos like you do here so that's going

00:06:53.350 --> 00:06:55.800 
combos like you do here so that's going
to<00:06:53.410> be<00:06:53.470> it<00:06:53.680> for<00:06:53.710> this<00:06:53.919> review<00:06:54.100> um<00:06:54.810> definitely

00:07:00.960 --> 00:07:00.970 
recommend them do not get them as soon

00:07:00.970 --> 00:07:02.939 
recommend them do not get them as soon
as<00:07:01.120> they<00:07:01.270> release<00:07:01.419> though<00:07:01.750> because<00:07:01.960> the<00:07:02.500> the

00:07:02.939 --> 00:07:02.949 
as they release though because the the

00:07:02.949 --> 00:07:04.560 
as they release though because the the
price<00:07:03.190> is<00:07:03.400> going<00:07:03.520> to<00:07:03.580> be<00:07:03.699> a<00:07:03.729> lot<00:07:03.940> higher<00:07:04.180> than

00:07:04.560 --> 00:07:04.570 
price is going to be a lot higher than

00:07:04.570 --> 00:07:07.500 
price is going to be a lot higher than
if<00:07:05.199> you<00:07:05.410> just<00:07:05.710> wait<00:07:06.430> it<00:07:06.639> out<00:07:06.820> and<00:07:07.120> get<00:07:07.389> them

00:07:07.500 --> 00:07:07.510 
if you just wait it out and get them

00:07:07.510 --> 00:07:11.730 
if you just wait it out and get them
later<00:07:09.570> but<00:07:10.570> these<00:07:10.780> are<00:07:10.930> definitely<00:07:11.380> worth<00:07:11.560> it

00:07:11.730 --> 00:07:11.740 
later but these are definitely worth it

00:07:11.740 --> 00:07:14.460 
later but these are definitely worth it
