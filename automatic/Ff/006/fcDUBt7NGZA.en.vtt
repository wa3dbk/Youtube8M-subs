underfoot cushions those landings adds a
little<00:00:34.200> bit<00:00:34.380> of<00:00:34.469> stability<00:00:34.620> making<00:00:35.430> it<00:00:35.520> easier

00:00:35.780 --> 00:00:35.790 
little bit of stability making it easier

00:00:40.010 --> 00:00:40.020 
jumps when you're in the park but we

00:00:40.020 --> 00:00:43.610 
jumps when you're in the park but we
also<00:00:40.200> decided<00:00:41.190> on<00:00:41.780> adding<00:00:42.780> early<00:00:43.140> rise<00:00:43.350> in<00:00:43.379> the

also decided on adding early rise in the

00:00:43.620 --> 00:00:46.190 
also decided on adding early rise in the

from<00:00:54.780> having<00:00:54.960> the<00:00:55.260> excellent<00:00:55.920> excellent<00:00:56.250> side

00:00:56.569 --> 00:00:56.579 
from having the excellent excellent side

00:00:56.579 --> 00:00:59.779 
from having the excellent excellent side
profile<00:00:57.320> we<00:00:58.320> realized<00:00:58.680> we<00:00:59.039> were<00:00:59.100> making<00:00:59.670> this

00:00:59.779 --> 00:00:59.789 
profile we realized we were making this

00:00:59.789 --> 00:01:01.099 
profile we realized we were making this
ski<00:01:00.000> that<00:01:00.149> a<00:01:00.180> lot<00:01:00.390> of<00:01:00.420> the<00:01:00.570> skis<00:01:00.870> that

00:01:01.099 --> 00:01:01.109 
ski that a lot of the skis that

00:01:01.109 --> 00:01:02.299 
ski that a lot of the skis that
companies<00:01:01.500> are<00:01:01.620> coming<00:01:01.770> out<00:01:01.949> with<00:01:01.980> today

00:01:02.299 --> 00:01:02.309 
companies are coming out with today

00:01:02.309 --> 00:01:05.479 
companies are coming out with today
they'll<00:01:03.239> add<00:01:03.359> rocker<00:01:03.690> into<00:01:03.989> a<00:01:04.019> Park<00:01:04.350> Ski<00:01:04.500> but

00:01:05.479 --> 00:01:05.489 
they'll add rocker into a Park Ski but

00:01:05.489 --> 00:01:08.510 
they'll add rocker into a Park Ski but
it<00:01:06.030> ends<00:01:06.270> up<00:01:06.330> being<00:01:06.390> useless<00:01:06.840> because<00:01:07.590> or<00:01:08.340> well

00:01:08.510 --> 00:01:08.520 
it ends up being useless because or well

00:01:08.520 --> 00:01:10.730 
it ends up being useless because or well
it<00:01:08.670> makes<00:01:08.790> your<00:01:08.909> edges<00:01:09.240> useless<00:01:09.600> because<00:01:10.409> when

00:01:10.730 --> 00:01:10.740 
it makes your edges useless because when

00:01:10.740 --> 00:01:14.300 
it makes your edges useless because when
where<00:01:11.640> the<00:01:11.850> surface<00:01:12.659> contact<00:01:13.200> starts<00:01:14.070> and

00:01:14.300 --> 00:01:14.310 
where the surface contact starts and

00:01:14.310 --> 00:01:17.539 
where the surface contact starts and
stops<00:01:14.720> is<00:01:15.720> where<00:01:16.350> the<00:01:16.500> actual<00:01:16.770> profile<00:01:17.310> of<00:01:17.430> the

00:01:17.539 --> 00:01:17.549 
stops is where the actual profile of the

00:01:17.549 --> 00:01:20.060 
stops is where the actual profile of the
ski<00:01:17.790> starts<00:01:18.240> so<00:01:18.720> we've<00:01:18.840> added<00:01:18.960> this<00:01:19.259> shape<00:01:19.890> in

00:01:20.060 --> 00:01:20.070 
ski starts so we've added this shape in

00:01:20.070 --> 00:01:21.950 
ski starts so we've added this shape in
here<00:01:20.250> it's<00:01:20.400> looks<00:01:21.210> strange<00:01:21.540> to<00:01:21.720> a<00:01:21.780> lot<00:01:21.930> of

00:01:21.950 --> 00:01:21.960 
here it's looks strange to a lot of

00:01:21.960 --> 00:01:24.140 
here it's looks strange to a lot of
people<00:01:22.350> but<00:01:22.890> it<00:01:22.979> actually<00:01:23.130> allows<00:01:23.670> you<00:01:23.850> to<00:01:24.030> get

00:01:24.140 --> 00:01:24.150 
people but it actually allows you to get

00:01:24.150 --> 00:01:26.390 
people but it actually allows you to get
an<00:01:24.240> edge<00:01:24.420> and<00:01:24.720> helps<00:01:25.680> a<00:01:25.770> lot<00:01:25.950> with<00:01:26.130> switch

00:01:26.390 --> 00:01:26.400 
an edge and helps a lot with switch

00:01:26.400 --> 00:01:29.390 
an edge and helps a lot with switch
riding<00:01:27.290> this<00:01:28.290> year<00:01:28.530> we've<00:01:28.680> added<00:01:28.829> a<00:01:29.009> faster

00:01:29.390 --> 00:01:29.400 
riding this year we've added a faster

00:01:29.400 --> 00:01:31.550 
riding this year we've added a faster
base<00:01:29.610> because<00:01:30.240> during<00:01:30.689> the<00:01:30.869> winter<00:01:31.140> the<00:01:31.290> ski

00:01:31.550 --> 00:01:31.560 
base because during the winter the ski

00:01:31.560 --> 00:01:33.440 
base because during the winter the ski
did<00:01:32.009> quite<00:01:32.189> well<00:01:32.430> on<00:01:32.460> the<00:01:32.579> park<00:01:32.909> and<00:01:33.150> kept<00:01:33.299> up

00:01:33.440 --> 00:01:33.450 
did quite well on the park and kept up

00:01:33.450 --> 00:01:35.929 
did quite well on the park and kept up
with<00:01:33.479> the<00:01:33.689> other<00:01:33.810> guys<00:01:34.340> riding<00:01:35.340> other<00:01:35.579> skis

00:01:35.929 --> 00:01:35.939 
with the other guys riding other skis

00:01:35.939 --> 00:01:37.160 
with the other guys riding other skis
but<00:01:36.270> then<00:01:36.420> when<00:01:36.570> you<00:01:36.630> got<00:01:36.780> it<00:01:36.869> out<00:01:36.900> to<00:01:36.960> the

00:01:37.160 --> 00:01:37.170 
but then when you got it out to the

00:01:37.170 --> 00:01:38.990 
but then when you got it out to the
summer<00:01:37.409> camps<00:01:37.829> and<00:01:38.040> the<00:01:38.159> spring<00:01:38.430> camps<00:01:38.790> it<00:01:38.909> was

00:01:38.990 --> 00:01:39.000 
summer camps and the spring camps it was

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:40.429 
summer camps and the spring camps it was
a<00:01:39.030> little<00:01:39.299> slower<00:01:39.540> so<00:01:39.659> we've<00:01:39.900> added<00:01:39.990> a<00:01:40.170> speed

00:01:40.429 --> 00:01:40.439 
a little slower so we've added a speed

00:01:40.439 --> 00:01:44.630 
a little slower so we've added a speed
base<00:01:40.619> in<00:01:40.829> here<00:01:41.009> 7,200<00:01:42.350> and<00:01:43.350> extremely<00:01:44.340> thick

indestructible for rails this is my
weapon<00:01:50.670> of<00:01:50.850> choice<00:01:50.909> for<00:01:51.119> the<00:01:51.360> park

00:01:54.260 --> 00:01:54.270

and<00:01:56.010> next<00:01:57.010> in<00:01:57.130> line<00:01:57.340> we<00:01:57.760> have<00:01:57.910> the<00:01:58.060> superior

00:02:01.010 --> 00:02:01.020 

00:02:01.020 --> 00:02:05.310 

when<00:02:02.020> I<00:02:03.090> go<00:02:04.090> out<00:02:04.210> in<00:02:04.330> the<00:02:04.420> powder<00:02:04.630> and<00:02:04.960> realize

when I go out in the powder and realize

00:02:05.320 --> 00:02:06.750 
when I go out in the powder and realize
that<00:02:05.350> it's<00:02:05.710> not<00:02:05.770> as<00:02:06.070> great<00:02:06.220> as<00:02:06.370> I<00:02:06.460> want<00:02:06.640> it<00:02:06.730> to

00:02:06.750 --> 00:02:06.760 
that it's not as great as I want it to
