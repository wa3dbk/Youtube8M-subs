another session of Dark Souls 2 PvP and
another<00:00:21.689> weapon<00:00:21.930> showcase<00:00:22.730> this<00:00:23.730> time<00:00:23.970> I'm

00:00:24.200 --> 00:00:24.210 
another weapon showcase this time I'm

00:00:24.210 --> 00:00:26.630 
another weapon showcase this time I'm
using<00:00:24.480> the<00:00:24.900> blue<00:00:25.320> night<00:00:25.500> halberd<00:00:25.920> which<00:00:26.490> you

00:00:26.630 --> 00:00:26.640 
using the blue night halberd which you

00:00:26.640 --> 00:00:28.099 
using the blue night halberd which you
can<00:00:26.820> get<00:00:26.970> in<00:00:27.180> one<00:00:27.420> of<00:00:27.570> two<00:00:27.840> ways

00:00:28.099 --> 00:00:28.109 
can get in one of two ways

00:00:28.109 --> 00:00:32.150 
can get in one of two ways
you<00:00:28.650> either<00:00:28.800> kill<00:00:29.250> tar<00:00:29.789> gray<00:00:30.060> or<00:00:30.840> you<00:00:31.590> can<00:00:31.890> do

00:00:32.150 --> 00:00:32.160 
you either kill tar gray or you can do

00:00:32.160 --> 00:00:33.830 
you either kill tar gray or you can do
some<00:00:32.399> stuff<00:00:32.610> with<00:00:32.669> the<00:00:32.940> blue<00:00:33.120> sentinels<00:00:33.600> and

00:00:33.830 --> 00:00:33.840 
some stuff with the blue sentinels and

00:00:33.840 --> 00:00:35.380 
some stuff with the blue sentinels and
he'll<00:00:34.050> give<00:00:34.260> it<00:00:34.290> to<00:00:34.410> you<00:00:34.530> eventually

00:00:35.380 --> 00:00:35.390 
he'll give it to you eventually

00:00:35.390 --> 00:00:37.850 
he'll give it to you eventually
honestly<00:00:36.390> it's<00:00:36.600> faster<00:00:37.200> just<00:00:37.410> to<00:00:37.500> kill<00:00:37.710> him

00:00:37.850 --> 00:00:37.860 
honestly it's faster just to kill him

00:00:37.860 --> 00:00:40.490 
honestly it's faster just to kill him
and<00:00:38.070> I<00:00:38.550> don't<00:00:38.940> like<00:00:39.450> the<00:00:39.750> way<00:00:39.840> he<00:00:40.050> talks<00:00:40.230> to<00:00:40.410> me

00:00:40.490 --> 00:00:40.500 
and I don't like the way he talks to me

00:00:40.500 --> 00:00:42.229 
and I don't like the way he talks to me
never<00:00:40.739> really<00:00:41.040> did<00:00:41.219> I<00:00:41.430> kill<00:00:41.670> him<00:00:41.730> in<00:00:41.850> my<00:00:41.969> first

00:00:42.229 --> 00:00:42.239 
never really did I kill him in my first

00:00:42.239 --> 00:00:44.779 
never really did I kill him in my first
playthrough<00:00:42.450> for<00:00:42.750> it<00:00:43.079> so<00:00:43.680> it's<00:00:43.980> just<00:00:44.160> a<00:00:44.430> habit

00:00:44.779 --> 00:00:44.789

that's sort of always carried over but

00:00:46.739 --> 00:00:49.580

00:01:04.070 --> 00:01:04.080 
damage of this weapon is 350 and for me

low<00:01:12.479> is<00:01:12.930> because<00:01:12.990> I'm<00:01:13.590> not<00:01:13.740> really<00:01:13.950> taking

00:01:14.179 --> 00:01:14.189 
low is because I'm not really taking

00:01:14.189 --> 00:01:16.130 
low is because I'm not really taking
advantage<00:01:14.390> advantage<00:01:15.390> of<00:01:15.600> the<00:01:15.780> strength

weapon<00:01:32.700> I<00:01:32.850> would<00:01:33.030> have<00:01:33.210> to<00:01:33.360> say<00:01:33.509> that<00:01:33.750> the

00:01:33.830 --> 00:01:33.840 
weapon I would have to say that the

00:01:33.840 --> 00:01:36.800 
weapon I would have to say that the
biggest<00:01:34.020> pro<00:01:34.500> of<00:01:34.770> the<00:01:34.890> weapon<00:01:35.240> would<00:01:36.240> be<00:01:36.270> the

00:01:36.800 --> 00:01:36.810 
biggest pro of the weapon would be the

00:01:36.810 --> 00:01:38.899 
biggest pro of the weapon would be the
fact<00:01:37.049> that<00:01:37.200> it's<00:01:37.470> moveset<00:01:37.920> is<00:01:37.950> a<00:01:38.159> typical

00:01:38.899 --> 00:01:38.909 
fact that it's moveset is a typical

00:01:38.909 --> 00:01:41.120 
fact that it's moveset is a typical
halberd<00:01:39.299> moveset<00:01:39.750> and<00:01:39.960> that's<00:01:40.320> a<00:01:40.500> really<00:01:40.860> good

00:01:41.120 --> 00:01:41.130 
halberd moveset and that's a really good

00:01:41.130 --> 00:01:44.510 
halberd moveset and that's a really good
thing<00:01:41.869> it's<00:01:42.869> got<00:01:43.079> high<00:01:43.439> base<00:01:43.710> damage<00:01:43.740> which<00:01:44.490> is

00:01:44.510 --> 00:01:44.520 
thing it's got high base damage which is

00:01:44.520 --> 00:01:47.030 
thing it's got high base damage which is
a<00:01:44.939> very<00:01:45.420> close<00:01:45.689> second<00:01:46.170> as<00:01:46.350> far<00:01:46.409> as<00:01:46.710> the<00:01:46.829> pros

00:01:47.030 --> 00:01:47.040 
a very close second as far as the pros

00:01:47.040 --> 00:01:49.340 
a very close second as far as the pros
are<00:01:47.189> concerned<00:01:47.579> and<00:01:47.850> that's<00:01:48.630> partially<00:01:49.020> due

00:01:49.340 --> 00:01:49.350 
are concerned and that's partially due

00:01:49.350 --> 00:01:50.690 
are concerned and that's partially due
to<00:01:49.380> the<00:01:49.500> fact<00:01:49.590> that<00:01:49.829> this<00:01:50.040> weapon<00:01:50.369> upgrades

00:01:50.690 --> 00:01:50.700 
to the fact that this weapon upgrades

00:01:50.700 --> 00:01:53.210 
to the fact that this weapon upgrades
with<00:01:50.909> twinkling<00:01:51.360> titanite<00:01:51.570> and<00:01:52.110> you<00:01:53.070> know

00:01:53.210 --> 00:01:53.220 
with twinkling titanite and you know

00:01:53.220 --> 00:01:55.819 
with twinkling titanite and you know
it's<00:01:54.090> a<00:01:54.509> really<00:01:55.170> good<00:01:55.290> weapon<00:01:55.590> if<00:01:55.710> you're

00:01:55.819 --> 00:01:55.829 
it's a really good weapon if you're

00:01:55.829 --> 00:01:57.230 
it's a really good weapon if you're
early<00:01:56.219> on<00:01:56.340> in<00:01:56.430> the<00:01:56.490> game<00:01:56.520> and<00:01:56.850> you<00:01:56.909> managed<00:01:57.210> to

00:01:57.230 --> 00:01:57.240 
early on in the game and you managed to

00:01:57.240 --> 00:01:58.850 
early on in the game and you managed to
kill<00:01:57.540> tar<00:01:57.780> gray<00:01:57.930> this<00:01:58.140> thing<00:01:58.320> can<00:01:58.500> carry<00:01:58.740> you

00:01:58.850 --> 00:01:58.860 
kill tar gray this thing can carry you

00:01:58.860 --> 00:02:01.860 
kill tar gray this thing can carry you
for<00:01:59.040> pretty<00:01:59.399> far<00:01:59.700> so<00:02:00.600> just<00:02:00.840> that

00:02:01.860 --> 00:02:01.870 
for pretty far so just that

00:02:01.870 --> 00:02:04.120 
for pretty far so just that
other<00:02:02.870> pros<00:02:03.230> of<00:02:03.350> the<00:02:03.410> weapon<00:02:03.680> you've<00:02:03.950> got<00:02:04.100> a

00:02:04.120 --> 00:02:04.130 
other pros of the weapon you've got a

00:02:04.130 --> 00:02:07.420 
other pros of the weapon you've got a
okayish<00:02:05.120> combo<00:02:05.630> ability<00:02:06.050> it's<00:02:06.230> been<00:02:06.830> changed

00:02:07.420 --> 00:02:07.430 
okayish combo ability it's been changed

00:02:07.430 --> 00:02:08.920 
okayish combo ability it's been changed
and<00:02:07.610> that's<00:02:07.910> something<00:02:08.150> they<00:02:08.420> like<00:02:08.630> to<00:02:08.660> mess

00:02:08.920 --> 00:02:08.930 
and that's something they like to mess

00:02:08.930 --> 00:02:11.860 
and that's something they like to mess
with<00:02:09.140> with<00:02:09.440> patches<00:02:09.950> it's<00:02:10.820> not<00:02:11.120> as<00:02:11.330> good<00:02:11.630> as<00:02:11.750> it

00:02:11.860 --> 00:02:11.870

looking<00:02:26.120> weapon<00:02:26.420> but<00:02:27.350> anyway<00:02:27.830> moving<00:02:28.520> on<00:02:28.820> the

00:02:29.050 --> 00:02:29.060 
looking weapon but anyway moving on the

00:02:29.060 --> 00:02:31.120 
looking weapon but anyway moving on the
cons<00:02:29.270> of<00:02:29.480> the<00:02:29.570> weapon<00:02:29.870> the<00:02:30.380> biggest<00:02:30.680> con<00:02:30.860> would

00:02:31.120 --> 00:02:31.130 
cons of the weapon the biggest con would

00:02:31.130 --> 00:02:32.610 
cons of the weapon the biggest con would
be<00:02:31.250> the<00:02:31.520> sweet<00:02:31.850> spot

00:02:32.610 --> 00:02:32.620 
be the sweet spot

00:02:32.620 --> 00:02:34.960 
be the sweet spot
like<00:02:33.620> all<00:02:33.800> halberds<00:02:34.070> this<00:02:34.520> weapon<00:02:34.850> is

00:02:34.960 --> 00:02:34.970 
like all halberds this weapon is

00:02:34.970 --> 00:02:38.200 
like all halberds this weapon is
affected<00:02:35.690> by<00:02:35.900> sweet<00:02:36.560> spots<00:02:36.890> and<00:02:37.250> that<00:02:38.060> can

00:02:38.200 --> 00:02:38.210 
affected by sweet spots and that can

00:02:38.210 --> 00:02:40.270 
affected by sweet spots and that can
make<00:02:38.300> it<00:02:38.360> a<00:02:38.510> little<00:02:38.630> bit<00:02:38.810> difficult<00:02:38.990> to<00:02:39.230> use<00:02:39.290> so

00:02:40.270 --> 00:02:40.280 
make it a little bit difficult to use so

00:02:40.280 --> 00:02:42.280 
make it a little bit difficult to use so
you<00:02:40.700> know<00:02:40.820> if<00:02:41.120> you<00:02:41.240> can<00:02:41.390> get<00:02:41.570> your<00:02:41.720> distances

00:02:42.280 --> 00:02:42.290 
you know if you can get your distances

00:02:42.290 --> 00:02:45.700 
you know if you can get your distances
down<00:02:42.590> then<00:02:43.460> you're<00:02:43.700> set<00:02:43.910> if<00:02:44.660> your<00:02:45.230> opponent<00:02:45.650> is

00:02:45.700 --> 00:02:45.710 
down then you're set if your opponent is

00:02:45.710 --> 00:02:47.740 
down then you're set if your opponent is
good<00:02:45.950> at<00:02:46.040> distancing<00:02:46.550> themselves<00:02:46.730> and<00:02:47.600> you're

00:02:47.740 --> 00:02:47.750 
good at distancing themselves and you're

00:02:47.750 --> 00:02:49.720 
good at distancing themselves and you're
gonna<00:02:47.870> have<00:02:48.020> trouble<00:02:48.230> it's<00:02:49.070> just<00:02:49.340> the<00:02:49.490> way<00:02:49.580> it

00:02:49.720 --> 00:02:49.730 
gonna have trouble it's just the way it

00:02:49.730 --> 00:02:51.700 
gonna have trouble it's just the way it
is<00:02:49.760> with<00:02:50.300> all<00:02:50.330> halberd<00:02:50.930> weapons<00:02:51.260> it's<00:02:51.500> the

00:02:51.700 --> 00:02:51.710 
is with all halberd weapons it's the

00:02:51.710 --> 00:02:53.890 
is with all halberd weapons it's the
biggest<00:02:51.980> con<00:02:52.160> for<00:02:52.520> pretty<00:02:53.090> much<00:02:53.180> all<00:02:53.450> of<00:02:53.720> them

00:02:53.890 --> 00:02:53.900 
biggest con for pretty much all of them

00:02:53.900 --> 00:02:56.050 
biggest con for pretty much all of them
and<00:02:54.170> there's<00:02:55.040> nothing<00:02:55.250> that's<00:02:55.610> gonna<00:02:55.760> change

00:02:56.050 --> 00:02:56.060 
and there's nothing that's gonna change

00:02:56.060 --> 00:03:00.720 
and there's nothing that's gonna change
that<00:02:56.360> so<00:02:57.040> it's<00:02:58.040> just<00:02:58.280> the<00:02:58.370> way<00:02:58.490> it<00:02:58.610> goes<00:02:59.020> but

00:03:00.720 --> 00:03:00.730 
that so it's just the way it goes but

00:03:00.730 --> 00:03:03.310 
that so it's just the way it goes but
other<00:03:01.730> than<00:03:01.940> that<00:03:02.000> there's<00:03:02.600> actually<00:03:02.900> one<00:03:03.050> pro

00:03:03.310 --> 00:03:03.320 
other than that there's actually one pro

00:03:03.320 --> 00:03:05.890 
other than that there's actually one pro
I<00:03:03.350> did<00:03:03.770> forget<00:03:04.040> to<00:03:04.100> mention<00:03:04.190> it's<00:03:04.760> counter<00:03:05.690> and

00:03:05.890 --> 00:03:05.900 
I did forget to mention it's counter and

00:03:05.900 --> 00:03:07.180 
I did forget to mention it's counter and
that<00:03:05.989> counter<00:03:06.320> about<00:03:06.500> its<00:03:06.650> critical<00:03:06.980> damage

00:03:07.180 --> 00:03:07.190 
that counter about its critical damage

00:03:07.190 --> 00:03:09.970 
that counter about its critical damage
is<00:03:07.550> very<00:03:08.360> good<00:03:08.570> but<00:03:09.380> again<00:03:09.470> that's<00:03:09.830> something

00:03:09.970 --> 00:03:09.980 
is very good but again that's something

00:03:09.980 --> 00:03:12.790 
is very good but again that's something
shared<00:03:10.459> among<00:03:10.790> Hall<00:03:10.970> verts<00:03:11.209> so<00:03:11.750> not<00:03:12.440> terribly

00:03:12.790 --> 00:03:12.800 
shared among Hall verts so not terribly

00:03:12.800 --> 00:03:15.910 
shared among Hall verts so not terribly
unique<00:03:12.980> which<00:03:13.880> is<00:03:14.090> why<00:03:14.239> this<00:03:14.510> showcase<00:03:15.200> is<00:03:15.440> so

00:03:15.910 --> 00:03:15.920 
unique which is why this showcase is so

00:03:15.920 --> 00:03:18.610 
unique which is why this showcase is so
short<00:03:16.459> it's<00:03:17.270> just<00:03:17.480> a<00:03:17.690> pretty<00:03:17.989> looking<00:03:18.260> weapon

00:03:18.610 --> 00:03:18.620 
short it's just a pretty looking weapon

00:03:18.620 --> 00:03:20.800

00:03:20.800 --> 00:03:20.810 
and you can get in one of two ways

00:03:20.810 --> 00:03:22.570 
and you can get in one of two ways
