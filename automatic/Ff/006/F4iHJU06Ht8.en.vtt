because you can hardly hear me when my

00:01:16.650 --> 00:01:19.490 
because you can hardly hear me when my
head<00:01:16.830> is<00:01:16.950> upside<00:01:17.130> down<00:01:18.140> basically<00:01:19.140> all<00:01:19.409> you

00:01:19.490 --> 00:01:19.500 
head is upside down basically all you

00:01:19.500 --> 00:01:21.050 
head is upside down basically all you
have<00:01:19.560> to<00:01:19.799> do<00:01:19.950> is<00:01:20.130> braid<00:01:20.460> your<00:01:20.670> hair<00:01:20.700> in<00:01:20.970> a

00:01:21.050 --> 00:01:21.060 
have to do is braid your hair in a

00:01:21.060 --> 00:01:23.570 
have to do is braid your hair in a
regular<00:01:21.479> braid<00:01:21.810> as<00:01:22.080> you<00:01:22.470> would<00:01:22.740> normally<00:01:23.040> the

00:01:23.570 --> 00:01:23.580 
regular braid as you would normally the

00:01:23.580 --> 00:01:25.219 
regular braid as you would normally the
only<00:01:23.880> difference<00:01:24.270> is<00:01:24.420> that<00:01:24.450> your<00:01:24.750> head<00:01:24.990> is

00:01:25.219 --> 00:01:25.229 
only difference is that your head is

00:01:25.229 --> 00:01:27.289 
only difference is that your head is
tilted<00:01:25.560> upside<00:01:26.130> down<00:01:26.310> but<00:01:26.729> that<00:01:26.820> doesn't<00:01:27.180> make

00:01:27.289 --> 00:01:27.299 
tilted upside down but that doesn't make

00:01:27.299 --> 00:01:29.539 
tilted upside down but that doesn't make
it<00:01:27.360> any<00:01:27.630> more<00:01:27.960> difficult<00:01:28.170> or<00:01:29.040> anything<00:01:29.280> like

00:01:29.539 --> 00:01:29.549 
it any more difficult or anything like

00:01:29.549 --> 00:01:31.670 
it any more difficult or anything like
that<00:01:29.610> all<00:01:30.210> I'm<00:01:30.450> doing<00:01:30.780> is<00:01:30.900> making<00:01:31.200> it<00:01:31.470> look<00:01:31.619> so

00:01:31.670 --> 00:01:31.680 
that all I'm doing is making it look so

00:01:31.680 --> 00:01:33.260 
that all I'm doing is making it look so
much<00:01:32.070> more<00:01:32.130> difficult<00:01:32.729> than<00:01:32.820> it<00:01:32.880> really<00:01:33.150> is

00:01:33.260 --> 00:01:33.270 
much more difficult than it really is

00:01:33.270 --> 00:01:42.940 
much more difficult than it really is
but<00:01:34.020> once<00:01:34.259> you<00:01:34.409> give<00:01:34.560> it<00:01:34.680> a<00:01:34.740> go<00:01:34.890> you'll<00:01:35.130> be<00:01:35.159> fine

00:01:42.940 --> 00:01:42.950 

00:01:42.950 --> 00:01:46.510
