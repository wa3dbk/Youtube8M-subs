 and this time more 

00:00:07.500 --> 00:00:09.629
 always shut down 

00:00:09.629 --> 00:00:11.579
 but not very much 

00:00:11.579 --> 00:00:13.349
 during this 

00:00:13.349 --> 00:00:15.709
 ZG

 petri church wants to get many a child 

00:00:32.360 --> 00:00:35.660
 it affects people the combo 

00:00:35.660 --> 00:00:38.980
 all flight tests together in one piece what a 

00:00:38.980 --> 00:00:41.980
 a lot of work 

00:00:43.130 --> 00:00:45.060
 then you go up

 it only takes one 

00:00:57.270 --> 00:00:59.190
 but no 

00:00:59.190 --> 00:01:01.880
 that will look like that 

00:01:01.880 --> 00:01:03.729
 probably without tires 

00:01:03.729 --> 00:01:05.079
 and it's theirs 

00:01:05.079 --> 00:01:08.100

00:01:08.100 --> 00:01:11.100
 with the participation is 

00:01:12.030 --> 00:01:15.030
 but we still need something too 

00:01:15.930 --> 00:01:19.369
 what she needs is a process in Menzingen 

00:01:19.369 --> 00:01:21.340
 that goes for the expenses 

00:01:21.340 --> 00:01:24.100
 Settings races Polish 

00:01:24.100 --> 00:01:25.850

 then we can smash the window 

00:03:07.479 --> 00:03:10.479
 to give one reason to the others 

00:03:11.859 --> 00:03:14.959

 Pauli 2 0 1 0 

00:04:36.600 --> 00:04:37.479

00:04:48.110 --> 00:04:51.110
 this 

00:04:52.759 --> 00:04:54.949
 we can adjust better 

00:04:54.949 --> 00:04:57.830
 Viennas should have taken care of 

00:04:57.830 --> 00:05:00.830
