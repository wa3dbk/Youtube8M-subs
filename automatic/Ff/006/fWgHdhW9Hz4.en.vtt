looking at the gameplay you can see here
I'm<00:00:26.699> playing<00:00:27.090> some<00:00:27.330> elite<00:00:27.570> slayer

00:00:27.820 --> 00:00:27.830 
I'm playing some elite slayer

00:00:27.830 --> 00:00:29.599

00:00:32.209 --> 00:00:32.219 
playlist and as much as I think that

00:00:32.219 --> 00:00:33.979

elite<00:00:32.850> slayer<00:00:33.000> is<00:00:33.270> probably<00:00:33.540> a<00:00:33.630> little<00:00:33.809> bit

00:00:33.979 --> 00:00:33.989 
elite slayer is probably a little bit

00:00:33.989 --> 00:00:35.930 
elite slayer is probably a little bit
easier<00:00:34.380> than<00:00:34.620> regular<00:00:34.770> Slayer<00:00:35.190> it's<00:00:35.730> still

00:00:35.930 --> 00:00:35.940 
easier than regular Slayer it's still

00:00:35.940 --> 00:00:38.119 
easier than regular Slayer it's still
extremely<00:00:36.239> fun<00:00:36.750> but<00:00:37.469> the<00:00:37.590> main<00:00:37.829> thing<00:00:37.860> that

00:00:38.119 --> 00:00:38.129 
extremely fun but the main thing that

00:00:38.129 --> 00:00:40.639 
extremely fun but the main thing that
really<00:00:38.760> confuses<00:00:39.690> me<00:00:39.840> is<00:00:39.870> why<00:00:40.110> i<00:00:40.140> don't<00:00:40.260> see

00:00:59.270 --> 00:00:59.280 
is that people don't run away from

is that people don't run away from
situations<00:00:59.460> where<00:00:59.940> they<00:01:00.090> can<00:01:00.300> clearly<00:01:01.230> not

00:01:01.639 --> 00:01:01.649 
situations where they can clearly not

00:01:01.649 --> 00:01:04.460 
situations where they can clearly not
win<00:01:01.980> it<00:01:02.280> is<00:01:02.730> clearly<00:01:03.059> impossible<00:01:03.329> for<00:01:04.049> them<00:01:04.170> to

win it is clearly impossible for them to
win<00:01:04.949> and<00:01:05.280> the<00:01:05.339> outcome<00:01:05.700> is<00:01:05.729> just<00:01:06.180> not<00:01:06.330> looking

00:01:06.440 --> 00:01:06.450

00:01:19.609 --> 00:01:19.619 
that time but what i think is really

00:01:19.619 --> 00:01:22.039 
that time but what i think is really
kind<00:01:20.549> of<00:01:20.670> a<00:01:20.790> critical<00:01:21.240> experience<00:01:21.750> or

00:01:22.039 --> 00:01:22.049 
kind of a critical experience or

00:01:22.049 --> 00:01:25.190 
kind of a critical experience or
critical<00:01:22.619> understanding<00:01:23.070> to<00:01:23.670> have<00:01:23.939> of<00:01:24.270> any

00:01:25.190 --> 00:01:25.200 
critical understanding to have of any

00:01:25.200 --> 00:01:27.320 
critical understanding to have of any
first-person<00:01:25.770> shooter<00:01:26.070> is<00:01:26.280> the<00:01:26.549> the

00:01:27.320 --> 00:01:27.330 
first-person shooter is the the

00:01:27.330 --> 00:01:30.020 
first-person shooter is the the
knowledge<00:01:27.750> of<00:01:27.960> when<00:01:28.229> you<00:01:28.680> to<00:01:29.250> retreat<00:01:29.640> you

00:01:30.020 --> 00:01:30.030 
knowledge of when you to retreat you

00:01:30.030 --> 00:01:31.370 
knowledge of when you to retreat you
know<00:01:30.119> knowing<00:01:30.479> when<00:01:30.810> you<00:01:30.930> will<00:01:31.110> fail

00:01:31.370 --> 00:01:31.380 
know knowing when you will fail

00:01:31.380 --> 00:01:33.679 
know knowing when you will fail
basically<00:01:32.250> is<00:01:32.460> something<00:01:33.210> that<00:01:33.299> i<00:01:33.360> think<00:01:33.420> is<00:01:33.630> a

00:01:33.679 --> 00:01:33.689 
basically is something that i think is a

00:01:33.689 --> 00:01:35.539 
basically is something that i think is a
very<00:01:33.780> overlooked<00:01:34.590> in<00:01:34.829> a<00:01:34.920> lot<00:01:35.100> of<00:01:35.220> first-person

00:01:35.539 --> 00:01:35.549 
very overlooked in a lot of first-person

00:01:35.549 --> 00:01:38.060 
very overlooked in a lot of first-person
shooter<00:01:35.939> games<00:01:36.150> and<00:01:36.360> I've<00:01:36.650> employed<00:01:37.650> it<00:01:37.920> in

00:01:38.060 --> 00:01:38.070 
shooter games and I've employed it in

00:01:38.070 --> 00:01:39.800 
shooter games and I've employed it in
battlefield<00:01:38.820> I've<00:01:39.000> employed<00:01:39.270> it<00:01:39.450> in<00:01:39.570> Call<00:01:39.780> of

00:01:39.800 --> 00:01:39.810 
battlefield I've employed it in Call of

00:01:39.810 --> 00:01:41.539 
battlefield I've employed it in Call of
Duty<00:01:40.170> have<00:01:40.259> employed<00:01:40.560> it<00:01:40.710> in<00:01:40.860> Halo<00:01:41.250> as<00:01:41.400> you'll

00:01:41.539 --> 00:01:41.549 
Duty have employed it in Halo as you'll

00:01:41.549 --> 00:01:43.370 
Duty have employed it in Halo as you'll
probably<00:01:41.790> see<00:01:42.119> in<00:01:42.270> this<00:01:42.329> game<00:01:42.509> play<00:01:42.659> it's

00:01:43.370 --> 00:01:43.380 
probably see in this game play it's

00:01:43.380 --> 00:01:44.530 
probably see in this game play it's
really<00:01:43.619> interesting<00:01:43.920> to<00:01:44.130> see<00:01:44.310> that<00:01:44.340> people

00:01:44.530 --> 00:01:44.540 
really interesting to see that people

00:01:44.540 --> 00:01:47.600 
really interesting to see that people
don't<00:01:45.540> use<00:01:45.899> a<00:01:45.930> lot<00:01:46.290> of<00:01:46.439> their<00:01:46.680> armor<00:01:47.189> abilities

00:01:47.600 --> 00:01:47.610 
don't use a lot of their armor abilities

00:01:47.610 --> 00:01:49.340 
don't use a lot of their armor abilities
in<00:01:47.909> defensive<00:01:48.479> ways<00:01:48.659> you<00:01:48.840> know<00:01:48.960> people<00:01:49.229> use

00:01:49.340 --> 00:01:49.350 
in defensive ways you know people use

00:01:49.350 --> 00:01:50.810 
in defensive ways you know people use
sprint<00:01:49.680> to<00:01:49.799> get<00:01:50.009> places<00:01:50.250> but<00:01:50.549> they<00:01:50.640> don't

00:01:50.810 --> 00:01:50.820 
sprint to get places but they don't

00:01:50.820 --> 00:01:52.060 
sprint to get places but they don't
really<00:01:50.939> use<00:01:51.210> it<00:01:51.360> too<00:01:51.479> much<00:01:51.630> to<00:01:51.810> get<00:01:51.899> away

00:01:52.060 --> 00:01:52.070 
really use it too much to get away

00:01:52.070 --> 00:01:55.429 
really use it too much to get away
people<00:01:53.070> use<00:01:53.340> evade<00:01:54.000> to<00:01:54.450> you<00:01:54.960> know<00:01:55.049> get<00:01:55.290> up

00:01:55.429 --> 00:01:55.439 
people use evade to you know get up

00:01:55.439 --> 00:01:56.840 
people use evade to you know get up
really<00:01:55.649> close<00:01:55.860> to<00:01:56.070> somebody<00:01:56.280> but<00:01:56.579> they<00:01:56.700> don't

00:01:56.840 --> 00:01:56.850 
really close to somebody but they don't

00:01:56.850 --> 00:01:58.850 
really close to somebody but they don't
really<00:01:57.090> use<00:01:57.270> it<00:01:57.450> to<00:01:57.630> roll<00:01:58.259> up<00:01:58.439> a<00:01:58.530> set<00:01:58.710> of<00:01:58.740> stairs

00:01:58.850 --> 00:01:58.860 
really use it to roll up a set of stairs

00:01:58.860 --> 00:02:01.219 
really use it to roll up a set of stairs
or<00:01:59.549> get<00:01:59.880> in<00:02:00.000> a<00:02:00.060> better<00:02:00.180> position<00:02:00.450> in<00:02:00.869> order<00:02:01.079> to

00:02:01.219 --> 00:02:01.229 
or get in a better position in order to

00:02:01.229 --> 00:02:03.560 
or get in a better position in order to
kind<00:02:01.439> of<00:02:01.469> get<00:02:01.560> the<00:02:01.619> jump<00:02:01.890> on<00:02:01.979> somebody<00:02:02.399> and<00:02:02.579> I

00:02:03.560 --> 00:02:03.570 
kind of get the jump on somebody and I

00:02:03.570 --> 00:02:04.580 
kind of get the jump on somebody and I
don't<00:02:03.810> know<00:02:03.899> if<00:02:04.020> that's<00:02:04.200> what<00:02:04.290> really

00:02:04.580 --> 00:02:04.590 
don't know if that's what really

00:02:04.590 --> 00:02:06.889 
don't know if that's what really
distinguishes<00:02:05.219> between<00:02:05.850> a<00:02:06.119> good<00:02:06.420> player<00:02:06.689> and

00:02:06.889 --> 00:02:06.899 
distinguishes between a good player and

00:02:06.899 --> 00:02:09.199 
distinguishes between a good player and
a<00:02:06.990> bad<00:02:07.170> player<00:02:07.469> but<00:02:08.160> I<00:02:08.190> do<00:02:08.310> think<00:02:08.789> that<00:02:08.940> it's

00:02:09.199 --> 00:02:09.209 
a bad player but I do think that it's

00:02:09.209 --> 00:02:12.229 
a bad player but I do think that it's
what<00:02:09.390> makes<00:02:09.599> the<00:02:10.349> winning<00:02:10.709> players<00:02:11.239> different

00:02:12.229 --> 00:02:12.239 
what makes the winning players different

00:02:12.239 --> 00:02:13.350 
what makes the winning players different
from<00:02:12.390> the<00:02:12.540> losing<00:02:12.750> play

00:02:13.350 --> 00:02:13.360 
from the losing play

00:02:13.360 --> 00:02:15.660 
from the losing play
and<00:02:13.570> I<00:02:14.020> don't<00:02:14.080> necessarily<00:02:14.860> run<00:02:15.070> away<00:02:15.310> you

00:02:15.660 --> 00:02:15.670 
and I don't necessarily run away you

00:02:15.670 --> 00:02:17.970 
and I don't necessarily run away you
know<00:02:15.790> with<00:02:15.970> a<00:02:16.000> lead<00:02:16.270> in<00:02:16.480> this<00:02:16.600> game<00:02:16.660> but<00:02:17.530> I<00:02:17.800> have

00:02:17.970 --> 00:02:17.980 
know with a lead in this game but I have

00:02:17.980 --> 00:02:19.920 
know with a lead in this game but I have
very<00:02:18.310> few<00:02:18.610> deaths<00:02:18.880> and<00:02:19.240> I<00:02:19.390> think<00:02:19.630> if<00:02:19.780> you're

00:02:19.920 --> 00:02:19.930 
very few deaths and I think if you're

00:02:19.930 --> 00:02:21.900 
very few deaths and I think if you're
dying<00:02:20.260> less<00:02:20.620> you<00:02:21.430> know<00:02:21.520> in<00:02:21.670> a<00:02:21.730> game<00:02:21.880> like

00:02:21.900 --> 00:02:21.910 
dying less you know in a game like

00:02:21.910 --> 00:02:23.310 
dying less you know in a game like
Slayer<00:02:22.330> it's<00:02:22.570> not<00:02:22.720> really<00:02:22.900> that<00:02:22.990> big<00:02:23.140> of<00:02:23.200> a

00:02:23.310 --> 00:02:23.320 
Slayer it's not really that big of a

00:02:23.320 --> 00:02:25.530 
Slayer it's not really that big of a
deal<00:02:23.560> but<00:02:24.400> if<00:02:24.610> you're<00:02:24.700> dying<00:02:25.030> list<00:02:25.300> that's

00:02:25.530 --> 00:02:25.540 
deal but if you're dying list that's

00:02:25.540 --> 00:02:27.420 
deal but if you're dying list that's
more<00:02:25.870> time<00:02:26.140> that<00:02:26.290> you<00:02:26.380> can<00:02:26.500> be<00:02:26.650> using<00:02:27.010> to<00:02:27.160> kill

00:02:27.420 --> 00:02:27.430 
more time that you can be using to kill

00:02:27.430 --> 00:02:29.580 
more time that you can be using to kill
people<00:02:27.640> so<00:02:28.090> that's<00:02:28.270> ultimately<00:02:28.840> a<00:02:29.140> really

00:02:29.580 --> 00:02:29.590 
people so that's ultimately a really

00:02:29.590 --> 00:02:33.030 
people so that's ultimately a really
good<00:02:29.830> optimized<00:02:30.820> way<00:02:31.540> to<00:02:31.600> use<00:02:32.050> your<00:02:32.230> time<00:02:32.470> but

00:02:33.030 --> 00:02:33.040 
good optimized way to use your time but

00:02:33.040 --> 00:02:34.410 
good optimized way to use your time but
the<00:02:33.340> main<00:02:33.490> topic<00:02:33.760> of<00:02:33.970> the<00:02:34.090> day<00:02:34.210> that<00:02:34.360> I

00:02:34.410 --> 00:02:34.420 
the main topic of the day that I

00:02:34.420 --> 00:02:35.910 
the main topic of the day that I
actually<00:02:34.630> want<00:02:34.930> to<00:02:34.960> talk<00:02:35.110> about<00:02:35.140> right<00:02:35.470> now<00:02:35.530> is

00:02:35.910 --> 00:02:35.920 
actually want to talk about right now is

00:02:35.920 --> 00:02:39.449 
actually want to talk about right now is
can<00:02:36.580> halo<00:02:37.000> 4<00:02:37.300> succeed<00:02:37.990> without<00:02:38.170> bungee<00:02:38.770> it's

00:02:39.449 --> 00:02:39.459 
can halo 4 succeed without bungee it's

00:02:39.459 --> 00:02:40.560 
can halo 4 succeed without bungee it's
kind<00:02:39.790> of<00:02:39.880> interesting<00:02:40.090> to<00:02:40.270> think<00:02:40.360> about

00:02:40.560 --> 00:02:40.570 
kind of interesting to think about

00:02:40.570 --> 00:02:43.140 
kind of interesting to think about
because<00:02:40.840> bungee<00:02:41.830> has<00:02:42.220> been<00:02:42.430> developing<00:02:42.880> Halo

00:02:43.140 --> 00:02:43.150 
because bungee has been developing Halo

00:02:43.150 --> 00:02:47.040 
because bungee has been developing Halo
games<00:02:43.330> for<00:02:43.660> close<00:02:44.290> to<00:02:44.640> 10<00:02:45.640> years<00:02:45.910> but<00:02:46.270> they

00:02:47.040 --> 00:02:47.050 
games for close to 10 years but they

00:02:47.050 --> 00:02:48.930 
games for close to 10 years but they
have<00:02:47.260> the<00:02:47.350> 20th<00:02:47.770> anniversary<00:02:48.250> lately<00:02:48.580> or

00:02:48.930 --> 00:02:48.940 
have the 20th anniversary lately or

00:02:48.940 --> 00:02:50.460 
have the 20th anniversary lately or
recently<00:02:49.390> and<00:02:49.600> I<00:02:49.660> actually<00:02:49.810> bought<00:02:50.110> the<00:02:50.290> burn

00:02:50.460 --> 00:02:50.470 
recently and I actually bought the burn

00:02:50.470 --> 00:02:52.160 
recently and I actually bought the burn
bright<00:02:50.740> burn<00:02:51.010> blue<00:02:51.280> t-shirt<00:02:51.700> because<00:02:51.850> my

00:02:52.160 --> 00:02:52.170 
bright burn blue t-shirt because my

00:02:52.170 --> 00:02:54.300 
bright burn blue t-shirt because my
nostalgia<00:02:53.170> kicked<00:02:53.410> in<00:02:53.530> and<00:02:53.620> I<00:02:53.709> was<00:02:53.830> like<00:02:53.950> oh<00:02:54.130> my

00:02:54.300 --> 00:02:54.310 
nostalgia kicked in and I was like oh my

00:02:54.310 --> 00:02:57.780 
nostalgia kicked in and I was like oh my
god<00:02:54.550> halo<00:02:55.030> over<00:02:55.830> but<00:02:56.830> it's<00:02:57.370> going<00:02:57.580> to<00:02:57.670> be

00:02:57.780 --> 00:02:57.790 
god halo over but it's going to be

00:02:57.790 --> 00:03:00.000 
god halo over but it's going to be
interesting<00:02:57.940> to<00:02:58.150> see<00:02:58.300> how<00:02:58.450> 343<00:02:59.230> industries

00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:00.010 
interesting to see how 343 industries

00:03:00.010 --> 00:03:02.160 
interesting to see how 343 industries
actually<00:03:00.610> carries<00:03:01.120> on<00:03:01.330> that<00:03:01.510> legacy<00:03:01.750> and

00:03:02.160 --> 00:03:02.170 
actually carries on that legacy and

00:03:02.170 --> 00:03:04.080 
actually carries on that legacy and
keeps<00:03:02.590> the<00:03:02.890> Halo<00:03:03.130> franchise<00:03:03.250> going<00:03:03.820> because

00:03:04.080 --> 00:03:04.090 
keeps the Halo franchise going because

00:03:04.090 --> 00:03:06.240 
keeps the Halo franchise going because
the<00:03:04.480> idea<00:03:04.780> of<00:03:04.870> a<00:03:04.930> new<00:03:05.050> trilogy<00:03:05.350> isn't<00:03:05.860> exactly

00:03:06.240 --> 00:03:06.250 
the idea of a new trilogy isn't exactly

00:03:06.250 --> 00:03:09.060 
the idea of a new trilogy isn't exactly
one<00:03:06.610> that<00:03:07.300> lends<00:03:07.540> itself<00:03:07.930> to<00:03:08.050> people<00:03:08.470> kind<00:03:09.010> of

00:03:09.060 --> 00:03:09.070 
one that lends itself to people kind of

00:03:09.070 --> 00:03:10.979 
one that lends itself to people kind of
it's<00:03:09.520> kind<00:03:09.730> of<00:03:09.850> weird<00:03:10.150> to<00:03:10.300> think<00:03:10.420> oh<00:03:10.720> we're

00:03:10.979 --> 00:03:10.989 
it's kind of weird to think oh we're

00:03:10.989 --> 00:03:12.540 
it's kind of weird to think oh we're
gonna<00:03:11.080> have<00:03:11.260> three<00:03:11.560> new<00:03:11.739> games<00:03:11.950> like<00:03:12.310> that's

00:03:12.540 --> 00:03:12.550 
gonna have three new games like that's

00:03:12.550 --> 00:03:13.800 
gonna have three new games like that's
kind<00:03:12.760> of<00:03:12.910> people<00:03:13.420> are<00:03:13.510> going<00:03:13.600> to<00:03:13.690> immediately

00:03:13.800 --> 00:03:13.810 
kind of people are going to immediately

00:03:13.810 --> 00:03:15.960 
kind of people are going to immediately
think<00:03:14.290> oh<00:03:14.470> so<00:03:14.980> you're<00:03:15.130> milking<00:03:15.310> the<00:03:15.520> franchise

00:03:15.960 --> 00:03:15.970 
think oh so you're milking the franchise

00:03:15.970 --> 00:03:18.900 
think oh so you're milking the franchise
but<00:03:16.450> my<00:03:17.140> initial<00:03:17.620> knee-jerk<00:03:18.130> reaction<00:03:18.730> was

00:03:18.900 --> 00:03:18.910 
but my initial knee-jerk reaction was

00:03:18.910 --> 00:03:20.670 
but my initial knee-jerk reaction was
more<00:03:19.150> like<00:03:19.360> is<00:03:19.570> it<00:03:19.720> going<00:03:19.840> to<00:03:19.900> be<00:03:19.989> any<00:03:20.140> good<00:03:20.320> or

00:03:20.670 --> 00:03:20.680 
more like is it going to be any good or

00:03:20.680 --> 00:03:22.440 
more like is it going to be any good or
is<00:03:20.830> it<00:03:20.860> going<00:03:21.070> to<00:03:21.160> be<00:03:21.340> go<00:03:21.850> the<00:03:21.970> way<00:03:22.060> of<00:03:22.090> guitar

00:03:22.440 --> 00:03:22.450 
is it going to be go the way of guitar

00:03:22.450 --> 00:03:24.930 
is it going to be go the way of guitar
hero<00:03:22.720> where<00:03:23.380> ya<00:03:23.709> excessive<00:03:24.250> milking<00:03:24.610> occurred

00:03:24.930 --> 00:03:24.940 
hero where ya excessive milking occurred

00:03:24.940 --> 00:03:26.820 
hero where ya excessive milking occurred
but<00:03:25.150> more<00:03:25.420> importantly<00:03:25.930> is<00:03:26.230> the<00:03:26.440> quality

00:03:26.820 --> 00:03:26.830 
but more importantly is the quality

00:03:26.830 --> 00:03:29.070 
but more importantly is the quality
going<00:03:27.130> to<00:03:27.280> diminish<00:03:27.700> as<00:03:27.940> a<00:03:28.150> result<00:03:28.630> of<00:03:28.840> a<00:03:28.930> new

00:03:29.070 --> 00:03:29.080 
going to diminish as a result of a new

00:03:29.080 --> 00:03:31.830 
going to diminish as a result of a new
studio<00:03:29.440> or<00:03:29.860> just<00:03:30.100> having<00:03:30.430> too<00:03:30.760> many<00:03:30.880> games<00:03:31.180> but

00:03:31.830 --> 00:03:31.840 
studio or just having too many games but

00:03:31.840 --> 00:03:33.030 
studio or just having too many games but
then<00:03:31.959> they<00:03:32.080> really<00:03:32.320> they<00:03:32.470> showed<00:03:32.680> the<00:03:32.769> release

00:03:33.030 --> 00:03:33.040 
then they really they showed the release

00:03:33.040 --> 00:03:35.220 
then they really they showed the release
date<00:03:33.280> and<00:03:33.489> it's<00:03:33.850> 2012<00:03:34.390> so<00:03:34.780> they're<00:03:34.930> not<00:03:35.019> up

00:03:35.220 --> 00:03:35.230 
date and it's 2012 so they're not up

00:03:35.230 --> 00:03:36.479 
date and it's 2012 so they're not up
there<00:03:35.260> obviously<00:03:35.530> not<00:03:35.830> trying<00:03:36.070> to<00:03:36.160> hurry

00:03:36.479 --> 00:03:36.489 
there obviously not trying to hurry

00:03:36.489 --> 00:03:39.120 
there obviously not trying to hurry
anything<00:03:36.970> in<00:03:37.450> order<00:03:37.720> to<00:03:37.840> make<00:03:37.989> a<00:03:38.019> 2011<00:03:38.769> holiday

00:03:39.120 --> 00:03:39.130 
anything in order to make a 2011 holiday

00:03:39.130 --> 00:03:40.860 
anything in order to make a 2011 holiday
release<00:03:39.430> date<00:03:39.700> or<00:03:39.970> window<00:03:40.299> or<00:03:40.570> anything<00:03:40.840> like

release date or window or anything like

00:03:40.870 --> 00:03:42.930 
release date or window or anything like
that<00:03:41.019> and<00:03:41.530> I<00:03:41.920> think<00:03:42.130> that<00:03:42.220> that's<00:03:42.250> actually<00:03:42.910> a

00:03:42.930 --> 00:03:42.940 
that and I think that that's actually a

00:03:42.940 --> 00:03:45.360 
that and I think that that's actually a
really<00:03:43.030> good<00:03:43.390> sign<00:03:43.930> same<00:03:44.470> with<00:03:44.620> mass<00:03:44.769> effect<00:03:45.100> 3

00:03:45.360 --> 00:03:45.370 
really good sign same with mass effect 3

00:03:45.370 --> 00:03:47.729 
really good sign same with mass effect 3
same<00:03:45.910> with<00:03:46.299> a<00:03:46.690> few<00:03:47.019> other<00:03:47.200> games<00:03:47.440> that<00:03:47.560> have

00:03:47.729 --> 00:03:47.739 
same with a few other games that have

00:03:47.739 --> 00:03:49.560 
same with a few other games that have
been<00:03:47.830> delayed<00:03:48.100> I<00:03:48.340> mean<00:03:48.519> when<00:03:48.880> deus<00:03:49.180> ex<00:03:49.360> was

00:03:49.560 --> 00:03:49.570 
been delayed I mean when deus ex was

00:03:49.570 --> 00:03:51.210 
been delayed I mean when deus ex was
delayed<00:03:49.840> a<00:03:49.870> few<00:03:50.019> months<00:03:50.590> back<00:03:50.769> that<00:03:51.040> was<00:03:51.190> a

00:03:51.210 --> 00:03:51.220 
delayed a few months back that was a

00:03:51.220 --> 00:03:52.560 
delayed a few months back that was a
really<00:03:51.430> good<00:03:51.610> sign<00:03:51.820> in<00:03:52.030> general<00:03:52.390> as

00:03:52.560 --> 00:03:52.570 
really good sign in general as

00:03:52.570 --> 00:03:54.420 
really good sign in general as
frustrating<00:03:53.260> as<00:03:53.350> it<00:03:53.410> is<00:03:53.620> if<00:03:53.890> a<00:03:54.040> game<00:03:54.220> gets

00:03:54.420 --> 00:03:54.430 
frustrating as it is if a game gets

00:03:54.430 --> 00:03:56.550 
frustrating as it is if a game gets
delayed<00:03:54.790> it's<00:03:55.360> either<00:03:55.630> a<00:03:55.810> sign<00:03:56.170> that<00:03:56.200> the<00:03:56.350> game

00:03:56.550 --> 00:03:56.560 
delayed it's either a sign that the game

00:03:56.560 --> 00:03:58.740 
delayed it's either a sign that the game
is<00:03:56.680> going<00:03:56.830> to<00:03:56.980> pale<00:03:57.250> because<00:03:57.549> it<00:03:58.000> has<00:03:58.150> too<00:03:58.630> many

00:03:58.740 --> 00:03:58.750 
is going to pale because it has too many

00:03:58.750 --> 00:04:00.210 
is going to pale because it has too many
problems<00:03:59.080> and<00:03:59.380> they<00:03:59.440> can<00:03:59.650> trap<00:03:59.830> them<00:03:59.920> all<00:04:00.040> up

00:04:00.210 --> 00:04:00.220 
problems and they can trap them all up

00:04:00.220 --> 00:04:02.789 
problems and they can trap them all up
in<00:04:00.340> time<00:04:00.549> or<00:04:01.180> they're<00:04:02.049> putting<00:04:02.410> on<00:04:02.500> that<00:04:02.620> extra

00:04:02.789 --> 00:04:02.799 
in time or they're putting on that extra

00:04:02.799 --> 00:04:04.080 
in time or they're putting on that extra
polish<00:04:03.070> and<00:04:03.400> they're<00:04:03.519> just<00:04:03.610> taking<00:04:03.850> their

00:04:04.080 --> 00:04:04.090 
polish and they're just taking their

00:04:04.090 --> 00:04:06.000 
polish and they're just taking their
time<00:04:04.239> with<00:04:04.420> it<00:04:04.540> so<00:04:04.780> I'm<00:04:05.049> thinking<00:04:05.110> that

00:04:06.000 --> 00:04:06.010 
time with it so I'm thinking that

00:04:06.010 --> 00:04:09.780 
time with it so I'm thinking that
because<00:04:06.280> of<00:04:06.880> the<00:04:07.150> fact<00:04:07.450> that<00:04:07.600> 343<00:04:08.200> is<00:04:08.790> mostly

00:04:09.780 --> 00:04:09.790 
because of the fact that 343 is mostly

00:04:09.790 --> 00:04:12.090
