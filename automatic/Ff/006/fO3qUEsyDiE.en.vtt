00:01:44.530 --> 00:01:44.540 
of always open

00:01:44.540 --> 00:01:51.640 
of always open
it<00:01:45.540> is<00:01:45.840> exactly<00:01:46.200> the<00:01:46.680> same<00:01:46.890> time<00:01:47.120> and<00:01:48.120> I<00:01:48.240> think

00:01:51.640 --> 00:01:51.650 

00:01:51.650 --> 00:01:54.440 

auntie<00:01:52.650> Sarah<00:01:52.920> and<00:01:53.220> make<00:01:53.700> it<00:01:53.910> work<00:01:54.120> because

00:01:54.440 --> 00:01:54.450 
auntie Sarah and make it work because

00:01:54.450 --> 00:01:57.770 
auntie Sarah and make it work because
the<00:01:54.810> playmakers<00:01:55.410> are<00:01:55.710> the<00:01:55.830> ones<00:01:56.010> in<00:01:56.780> deep

00:01:57.770 --> 00:01:57.780 
the playmakers are the ones in deep

00:01:57.780 --> 00:01:59.870 
the playmakers are the ones in deep
clean<00:01:58.020> the<00:01:58.140> game<00:01:58.320> so<00:01:58.830> obviously<00:01:59.400> those<00:01:59.610> four

00:01:59.870 --> 00:01:59.880 
clean the game so obviously those four

00:01:59.880 --> 00:02:01.640 
clean the game so obviously those four
have<00:02:00.090> something<00:02:00.540> here<00:02:00.810> and<00:02:01.380> they<00:02:01.470> obviously

00:02:01.640 --> 00:02:01.650 
have something here and they obviously

00:02:01.650 --> 00:02:04.280 
have something here and they obviously
have<00:02:02.010> another<00:02:02.280> tactic<00:02:02.730> to<00:02:03.030> counter<00:02:03.510> now<00:02:04.080> if

00:02:04.280 --> 00:02:04.290 
have another tactic to counter now if

00:02:04.290 --> 00:02:06.380 
have another tactic to counter now if
you'll<00:02:04.830> see<00:02:04.980> an<00:02:05.070> aggressive<00:02:05.460> nominee<00:02:05.790> see<00:02:06.360> a

00:02:06.380 --> 00:02:06.390 
you'll see an aggressive nominee see a
