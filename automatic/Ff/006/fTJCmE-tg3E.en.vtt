00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:08.160
 hey people so yes as you can see here 

00:00:06.480 --> 00:00:10.769
 new armor is at herauÃŸen 

00:00:08.160 --> 00:00:13.769
 battlefield heroes of the fresh today 

00:00:10.769 --> 00:00:15.719
 come or yesterday or today no 

00:00:13.769 --> 00:00:20.070
 I've just seen her today 

00:00:15.719 --> 00:00:25.590
 and I thought so I'll show you now 

00:00:20.070 --> 00:00:29.880
 yes, one has now actually as an 

00:00:25.590 --> 00:00:37.050
 the head but then the post 

00:00:29.880 --> 00:00:43.079
 gloves a pair of pants and shoes for the 

00:00:37.050 --> 00:00:46.739
 Feet more you do not have and yes like that 

00:00:43.079 --> 00:00:48.930
 armor in game also looks good 

00:00:46.739 --> 00:00:51.420
 right now so looks of optical 

00:00:48.930 --> 00:00:54.329
 not that bad 

00:00:51.420 --> 00:00:58.969
 So it is actually recommended 

00:00:54.329 --> 00:01:01.199
 rather care or buy the armor 

00:00:58.969 --> 00:01:10.650
 So I myself do not think so 

00:01:01.199 --> 00:01:14.610
 bad so people we are in the game 

00:01:10.650 --> 00:01:17.540
 you see here the new stand we will be 

00:01:14.610 --> 00:01:17.540
 same time there 

00:01:19.980 --> 00:01:29.650
 as actually looks quite good 

00:01:26.260 --> 00:01:29.650
 to inject 

00:01:36.700 --> 00:01:41.320
 I feel it a little bit with the 9 

00:01:41.520 --> 00:01:43.759
 tja 

00:01:46.770 --> 00:01:53.800
 yes it is not quite 

00:01:51.700 --> 00:01:56.280
 Realistically, let's be honest 

00:01:53.800 --> 00:02:00.580
 the whole game is not 

00:01:56.280 --> 00:02:06.119
 realistic and the armor just 

00:02:00.580 --> 00:02:06.119
 is really on the border already for 

00:02:14.540 --> 00:02:22.099
 they are not two 

00:02:18.859 --> 00:02:26.799
 bad she also fits the weapons 

00:02:22.099 --> 00:02:28.819
 Well, I find to the mgs and the 

00:02:26.799 --> 00:02:31.519
 student laser weapons I actually 

00:02:28.819 --> 00:02:34.609
 no more players because many people 

00:02:31.519 --> 00:02:36.590
 just have something to read and have 

00:02:34.609 --> 00:02:39.140
 That's why I never said that 

00:02:36.590 --> 00:02:41.620
 will use laser weapons again and 

00:02:39.140 --> 00:02:41.620
 actually 

00:02:44.050 --> 00:02:47.400
 normal pours 

00:02:49.480 --> 00:02:54.090
 finally want the shit here 

00:02:55.110 --> 00:03:02.250
 snappy level 4 am playing four times 

00:02:58.440 --> 00:03:02.250
 test the armor 

00:03:21.710 --> 00:03:24.710
 mean 

00:03:27.900 --> 00:03:35.930
 So I would say that was it 

00:03:32.549 --> 00:03:51.769
 Actually you see the armor is real 

00:03:35.930 --> 00:03:55.310
 Two okay, I really want to buy it 

00:03:51.769 --> 00:03:55.310
 have fun with it
