00:05:08.740 --> 00:05:08.750 
this is done all the faces will be

00:05:08.750 --> 00:05:10.690 
this is done all the faces will be
loaded<00:05:09.110> into<00:05:09.230> your<00:05:09.380> game<00:05:09.860> this<00:05:10.220> is<00:05:10.400> really

00:05:10.690 --> 00:05:10.700 
loaded into your game this is really

00:05:10.700 --> 00:05:12.580 
loaded into your game this is really
important<00:05:11.210> that<00:05:11.270> you<00:05:11.419> follow<00:05:11.570> this<00:05:11.930> step<00:05:12.230> with

00:05:12.580 --> 00:05:12.590 
important that you follow this step with

00:05:12.590 --> 00:05:14.050 
important that you follow this step with
declaring<00:05:13.040> the<00:05:13.130> cache<00:05:13.310> or<00:05:13.490> reloading<00:05:13.940> the

00:05:14.050 --> 00:05:14.060 
declaring the cache or reloading the

00:05:14.060 --> 00:05:16.270 
declaring the cache or reloading the
skin<00:05:14.330> and<00:05:14.570> then<00:05:15.169> go<00:05:15.620> back<00:05:15.830> into<00:05:16.010> the<00:05:16.160> game

00:05:16.270 --> 00:05:16.280 
skin and then go back into the game

00:05:16.280 --> 00:05:18.790 
skin and then go back into the game
because<00:05:16.460> if<00:05:16.669> you<00:05:16.790> don't<00:05:17.060> do<00:05:17.270> it<00:05:17.350> you<00:05:18.350> can<00:05:18.560> have

00:05:18.790 --> 00:05:18.800 
because if you don't do it you can have

00:05:18.800 --> 00:05:21.130 
because if you don't do it you can have
problems<00:05:19.400> with<00:05:19.850> the<00:05:20.450> faces<00:05:20.810> just<00:05:20.990> not

00:05:21.130 --> 00:05:21.140 
problems with the faces just not

00:05:21.140 --> 00:05:22.540 
problems with the faces just not
appearing<00:05:21.620> even<00:05:21.890> if<00:05:21.980> you've<00:05:22.100> got<00:05:22.250> them<00:05:22.370> in<00:05:22.430> the

00:05:22.540 --> 00:05:22.550 
appearing even if you've got them in the

00:05:22.550 --> 00:05:24.670 
appearing even if you've got them in the
right<00:05:22.669> folders<00:05:23.180> so<00:05:23.900> it's<00:05:24.050> a<00:05:24.110> really<00:05:24.350> simple

00:05:24.670 --> 00:05:24.680 
right folders so it's a really simple

00:05:24.680 --> 00:05:26.860 
right folders so it's a really simple
process<00:05:24.919> as<00:05:25.790> I<00:05:25.970> said<00:05:26.150> if<00:05:26.270> you're<00:05:26.390> unfamiliar

00:05:26.860 --> 00:05:26.870 
process as I said if you're unfamiliar

00:05:26.870 --> 00:05:28.450 
process as I said if you're unfamiliar
