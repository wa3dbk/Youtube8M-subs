is<00:05:22.440> pretty<00:05:22.650> common<00:05:22.919> and<00:05:23.310> then<00:05:24.240> I<00:05:24.330> carried

00:05:24.649 --> 00:05:24.659 
is pretty common and then I carried

00:05:24.659 --> 00:05:26.540 
is pretty common and then I carried
those<00:05:24.840> tomatoes<00:05:25.349> and<00:05:25.650> I<00:05:25.680> make<00:05:25.860> this<00:05:26.009> mix<00:05:26.310> of

00:05:26.540 --> 00:05:26.550 
those tomatoes and I make this mix of

00:05:26.550 --> 00:05:29.149 
those tomatoes and I make this mix of
like<00:05:26.789> Brooklyn<00:05:27.780> ricotta<00:05:28.110> goat<00:05:28.560> cheese<00:05:28.830> and

00:05:29.149 --> 00:05:29.159 
like Brooklyn ricotta goat cheese and

00:05:29.159 --> 00:05:31.700 
like Brooklyn ricotta goat cheese and
cheddar<00:05:30.000> so<00:05:30.300> it's<00:05:30.449> like<00:05:30.599> this<00:05:31.110> really<00:05:31.349> Chloe

00:05:31.700 --> 00:05:31.710 
cheddar so it's like this really Chloe

00:05:31.710 --> 00:05:34.279 
cheddar so it's like this really Chloe
doing<00:05:32.009> kind<00:05:32.460> of<00:05:32.580> weird<00:05:33.509> thing<00:05:33.750> that<00:05:33.780> happened

00:05:34.279 --> 00:05:34.289 
doing kind of weird thing that happened

00:05:34.289 --> 00:05:36.890 
doing kind of weird thing that happened
and<00:05:34.349> then<00:05:34.500> we<00:05:35.190> paired<00:05:35.490> it<00:05:35.580> with<00:05:35.639> a<00:05:35.759> okra<00:05:36.479> Malad

00:05:36.890 --> 00:05:36.900 
and then we paired it with a okra Malad

00:05:36.900 --> 00:05:38.930 
and then we paired it with a okra Malad
so<00:05:37.229> it<00:05:38.039> just<00:05:38.220> turned<00:05:38.340> out<00:05:38.400> to<00:05:38.460> be<00:05:38.669> a<00:05:38.699> really

00:05:38.930 --> 00:05:38.940 
so it just turned out to be a really

00:05:38.940 --> 00:05:40.370
