00:00:10.260 --> 00:00:15.389
 these seven tips are based on the 

00:00:13.170 --> 00:00:18.320
 bigger mistakes that men normally

00:00:44.390 --> 00:00:49.129
 I know that football is our passion 

00:00:46.789 --> 00:00:52.789
 mainly men like 

00:00:49.129 --> 00:00:55.309

00:00:52.789 --> 00:00:58.640
 all the events that you are are not 

00:00:55.309 --> 00:01:00.739
 very indicated the shirt should be used 

00:00:58.640 --> 00:01:03.519
 just to go and cheer for your team 

00:01:00.739 --> 00:01:06.770
 in the country or to go to the gym 

00:01:03.519 --> 00:01:08.570
 avoid wearing a team shirt that does not 

00:01:06.770 --> 00:01:12.920
 either for these occasions 

00:01:08.570 --> 00:01:16.130
 The second tip is about them sporting 

00:01:12.920 --> 00:01:18.289
 many men use sp es to go to 

00:01:16.130 --> 00:01:21.229
 academy to be able to do sports in 

00:01:18.289 --> 00:01:23.420
 occasions other than within the 

00:01:21.229 --> 00:01:27.470
 gym but it 's wrong 

00:01:23.420 --> 00:01:30.979
 this pl spix and use only there the thefts 

00:01:27.470 --> 00:01:33.710
 sneakers like beings streets or did that are 

00:01:30.979 --> 00:01:36.080
 more deprived more relaxed but 

00:01:33.710 --> 00:01:38.810
 other than those sneakers that you are 

00:01:36.080 --> 00:01:39.740
 accustomed to use for activities 

00:01:38.810 --> 00:01:42.530
 physical 

00:01:39.740 --> 00:01:44.810
 The third tip on T-shirts if you 

00:01:42.530 --> 00:01:48.469
 is more muscular stronger 

00:01:44.810 --> 00:01:51.259
 do not wear too tight shirts use a 

00:01:48.469 --> 00:01:52.460
 fairer but not as 

00:01:51.259 --> 00:01:54.890
 tight 

00:01:52.460 --> 00:01:57.649
 if you are more chubby more acute 

00:01:54.890 --> 00:02:00.020
 also avoid tight shirts 

00:01:57.649 --> 00:02:02.570
 buy one that's right for your 

00:02:00.020 --> 00:02:04.100
 physical type that is neither too broad 

00:02:02.570 --> 00:02:06.259
 it's not very fair 

00:02:04.100 --> 00:02:07.399
 so it is also true for people are 

00:02:06.259 --> 00:02:09.229
 very skinny 

00:02:07.399 --> 00:02:11.299
 it can not look like a 

00:02:09.229 --> 00:02:13.519
 and not so fair to 

00:02:11.299 --> 00:02:16.700
 to be able to show even more that you are in 

00:02:13.519 --> 00:02:20.239
 Also if you buy a T-shirt 

00:02:16.700 --> 00:02:22.340
 with neck v goods and try because it is not 

00:02:20.239 --> 00:02:23.120
 everyone who gets on well with this kind of 

00:02:22.340 --> 00:02:25.970
 ball 

00:02:23.120 --> 00:02:30.190
 who has a very thin and long neck 

00:02:25.970 --> 00:02:34.519
 should avoid this kind of sticking 

00:02:30.190 --> 00:02:37.459
 Now if you have a shorter neck 

00:02:34.519 --> 00:02:39.200
 and fuller you can bet on this 

00:02:37.459 --> 00:02:41.510
 type of ball more 

00:02:39.200 --> 00:02:43.430
 stay in relation to her depth 

00:02:41.510 --> 00:02:46.940
 It can not be too deep. 

00:02:43.430 --> 00:02:49.340
 The Fourth Tip Is About Shirts 

00:02:46.940 --> 00:02:51.890
 if you do not wear a shirt you do not have 

00:02:49.340 --> 00:02:55.010
 need to leave open several 

00:02:51.890 --> 00:02:58.010
 buttons lets only the first one is like this 

00:02:55.010 --> 00:02:59.989
 which is most appropriate to the fifth tip is 

00:02:58.010 --> 00:03:02.540
 about social shoe 

00:02:59.989 --> 00:03:05.870
 if you are using a social shoe ever 

00:03:02.540 --> 00:03:07.700

00:03:05.870 --> 00:03:09.920

00:03:09.920 --> 00:03:14.660
 social eating 

00:03:12.019 --> 00:03:15.980
 If you are going to use it, do not use it too. 

00:03:14.660 --> 00:03:17.840
 sport theft 

00:03:15.980 --> 00:03:21.140

00:03:17.840 --> 00:03:25.069
 social clothing you are accessing is tip 

00:03:21.140 --> 00:03:26.180

00:03:25.069 --> 00:03:28.880

00:03:26.180 --> 00:03:31.069
 if you are going to buy a pair of pants with 

00:03:28.880 --> 00:03:34.280
 a good with the correct measurement of his 

00:03:31.069 --> 00:03:37.160
 because there are many men who 

00:03:34.280 --> 00:03:40.370
 they wear pants that are a bit wider and 

00:03:37.160 --> 00:03:41.989
 seems correct for the cental to lower and not 

00:03:40.370 --> 00:03:44.900
 it's nothing classy 

00:03:41.989 --> 00:03:48.260
 some men buy large pants in the 

00:03:44.900 --> 00:03:50.090
 waist and wear a belt to adjust 

00:03:48.260 --> 00:03:52.579
 there is that tight belt with the 

00:03:50.090 --> 00:03:53.329
 widening pants does not stay 

00:03:52.579 --> 00:03:55.400

00:03:53.329 --> 00:03:56.480
 very tight pants are also not 

00:03:55.400 --> 00:03:59.450

00:03:56.480 --> 00:04:01.040
 if you have the thickest legs of the 

00:03:59.450 --> 00:04:02.180
 that the rest of your body is 

00:04:01.040 --> 00:04:04.730
 disproportionate 

00:04:02.180 --> 00:04:08.049
 it is not recommended that you use those 

00:04:04.730 --> 00:04:10.940
 causes of the skinny model are fairer 

00:04:08.049 --> 00:04:12.829
 choose straighter pants is more 

00:04:10.940 --> 00:04:15.230
 indicated for this physical type 

00:04:12.829 --> 00:04:18.380
 The same applies to people who have 

00:04:15.230 --> 00:04:21.440
 very thin legs wear very pants 

00:04:18.380 --> 00:04:22.970
