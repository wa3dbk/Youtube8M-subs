shuriken goes if I finger points over in

00:01:50.690 --> 00:01:52.180 
shuriken goes if I finger points over in
that<00:01:50.810> direction<00:01:50.990> even<00:01:51.680> though<00:01:51.770> I'm<00:01:51.860> looking

that direction even though I'm looking
over<00:01:52.250> here<00:01:52.700> I<00:01:52.850> might<00:01:53.300> if<00:01:53.330> my<00:01:53.600> finger<00:01:53.930> goes<00:01:54.050> over

00:01:55.030 --> 00:01:55.040 
over here I might if my finger goes over

00:01:55.040 --> 00:01:56.890 
over here I might if my finger goes over
there<00:01:55.190> the<00:01:55.610> blood<00:01:55.850> sugar<00:01:55.880> cane<00:01:56.390> goes<00:01:56.540> over

00:01:56.890 --> 00:01:56.900 
there the blood sugar cane goes over

00:01:56.900 --> 00:02:01.660 
there the blood sugar cane goes over
there<00:01:57.460> okay<00:01:58.460> if<00:01:59.050> I<00:02:00.050> point<00:02:00.590> my<00:02:00.680> finger<00:02:00.830> directly

00:02:01.660 --> 00:02:01.670 
there okay if I point my finger directly

00:02:01.670 --> 00:02:06.310 
there okay if I point my finger directly
forward<00:02:03.970> the<00:02:04.970> shuriken<00:02:05.390> goes<00:02:05.570> as<00:02:05.810> straight<00:02:06.170> as

00:02:06.310 --> 00:02:06.320 
forward the shuriken goes as straight as

00:02:06.320 --> 00:02:09.100 
forward the shuriken goes as straight as
possible<00:02:06.670> okay<00:02:07.670> my<00:02:08.149> hand<00:02:08.390> moved<00:02:08.599> off<00:02:08.810> slightly

00:02:09.100 --> 00:02:09.110 
possible okay my hand moved off slightly

00:02:09.110 --> 00:02:10.450 
possible okay my hand moved off slightly
that's<00:02:09.470> why<00:02:09.739> it<00:02:09.800> didn't<00:02:10.160> go<00:02:10.280> completely

00:02:10.450 --> 00:02:10.460 
that's why it didn't go completely

00:02:10.460 --> 00:02:12.340 
that's why it didn't go completely
straight<00:02:11.120> and<00:02:11.330> I<00:02:11.600> don't<00:02:11.810> really<00:02:12.020> want<00:02:12.290> to

00:02:12.340 --> 00:02:12.350 
straight and I don't really want to

00:02:12.350 --> 00:02:15.710 
straight and I don't really want to
throw<00:02:12.530> it<00:02:12.560> directly<00:02:13.160> at<00:02:13.640> the<00:02:13.730> camera<00:02:13.900> but

00:02:15.710 --> 00:02:15.720 
throw it directly at the camera but
