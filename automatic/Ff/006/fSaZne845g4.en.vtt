fire<00:00:38.830> to<00:00:39.309> the<00:00:39.430> back<00:00:39.610> and<00:00:39.879> this<00:00:40.750> is<00:00:40.840> real<00:00:41.050> crude

00:00:41.340 --> 00:00:41.350

00:00:41.350 --> 00:00:43.380 
fire to the back and this is real crude
but<00:00:41.620> it<00:00:41.710> works<00:00:41.860> well<00:00:42.190> the<00:00:42.550> cool<00:00:42.760> thing<00:00:42.820> is<00:00:43.090> I

00:00:43.380 --> 00:00:43.390 
but it works well the cool thing is I

00:00:43.390 --> 00:00:45.540 
but it works well the cool thing is I
don't<00:00:43.450> have<00:00:43.600> to<00:00:43.780> babysit<00:00:44.260> these<00:00:44.440> ribs<00:00:44.710> yes

00:00:45.540 --> 00:00:45.550 
don't have to babysit these ribs yes

00:00:45.550 --> 00:00:47.190 
don't have to babysit these ribs yes
they<00:00:45.730> were<00:00:45.790> wrapped<00:00:46.120> up<00:00:46.360> in<00:00:46.540> aluminum<00:00:46.960> foil

00:00:47.190 --> 00:00:47.200 
they were wrapped up in aluminum foil

00:00:47.200 --> 00:00:51.960 
they were wrapped up in aluminum foil
and<00:00:47.880> and<00:00:49.410> we<00:00:50.410> basically<00:00:50.800> had<00:00:51.220> to<00:00:51.250> do<00:00:51.430> nothing

00:00:51.960 --> 00:00:51.970 
and and we basically had to do nothing

00:00:51.970 --> 00:00:53.850 
and and we basically had to do nothing
because<00:00:52.270> the<00:00:52.540> water<00:00:52.750> temperature<00:00:53.140> varies<00:00:53.710> on

00:00:53.850 --> 00:00:53.860 
because the water temperature varies on

00:00:53.860 --> 00:00:57.510 
because the water temperature varies on
on<00:00:54.340> the<00:00:54.520> boiler<00:00:54.910> from<00:00:55.149> 175<00:00:55.750> to<00:00:56.079> 185<00:00:56.590> and<00:00:57.309> that

00:00:57.510 --> 00:00:57.520 
on the boiler from 175 to 185 and that

00:00:57.520 --> 00:00:59.870 
on the boiler from 175 to 185 and that
ends<00:00:57.880> up<00:00:57.969> keeping<00:00:58.329> these<00:00:58.530> ribs<00:00:59.530> from

00:00:59.870 --> 00:00:59.880 
ends up keeping these ribs from

00:00:59.880 --> 00:01:03.180 
ends up keeping these ribs from
overcooking<00:01:00.880> cooking<00:01:01.450> too<00:01:01.629> hot<00:01:01.890> and<00:01:02.890> so<00:01:03.100> you

00:01:03.180 --> 00:01:03.190 
overcooking cooking too hot and so you

00:01:03.190 --> 00:01:05.189 
overcooking cooking too hot and so you
get<00:01:03.250> real<00:01:03.489> good<00:01:03.700> temperature<00:01:04.119> control<00:01:04.540> on<00:01:04.809> the

00:01:05.189 --> 00:01:05.199 
get real good temperature control on the

00:01:05.199 --> 00:01:08.010 
get real good temperature control on the
ribs<00:01:05.440> we've<00:01:05.890> done<00:01:06.130> like<00:01:06.940> 12<00:01:07.240> Boston<00:01:07.690> butts<00:01:07.869> at
