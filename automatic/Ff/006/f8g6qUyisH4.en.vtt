put our bricks down after getting cool
assembled<00:00:07.560> inside<00:00:08.040> the<00:00:08.309> hole<00:00:08.519> on<00:00:08.790> the<00:00:09.780> flat

00:00:10.250 --> 00:00:10.260 
assembled inside the hole on the flat

00:00:10.260 --> 00:00:13.129 
assembled inside the hole on the flat
surface<00:00:10.830> that<00:00:10.860> we<00:00:11.730> did<00:00:11.880> get<00:00:12.000> our<00:00:12.120> lower<00:00:12.360> spot<00:00:12.840> I

00:00:13.129 --> 00:00:13.139 
surface that we did get our lower spot I

00:00:13.139 --> 00:00:14.509 
surface that we did get our lower spot I
know<00:00:13.320> you<00:00:13.380> probably<00:00:13.620> can't<00:00:13.769> see<00:00:13.980> it<00:00:14.190> but<00:00:14.280> that

00:00:14.509 --> 00:00:14.519 
know you probably can't see it but that

00:00:14.519 --> 00:00:17.750 
know you probably can't see it but that
is<00:00:14.670> a<00:00:14.700> good<00:00:15.000> a<00:00:15.560> inches<00:00:16.560> deeper<00:00:17.100> probably<00:00:17.640> in

00:00:17.750 --> 00:00:17.760 
is a good a inches deeper probably in

00:00:17.760 --> 00:00:21.170 
is a good a inches deeper probably in
the<00:00:17.880> center<00:00:18.590> also<00:00:19.590> used<00:00:20.070> a<00:00:20.279> I<00:00:20.550> wish<00:00:20.970> I<00:00:21.090> had

00:00:21.170 --> 00:00:21.180 
the center also used a I wish I had

00:00:21.180 --> 00:00:24.080 
the center also used a I wish I had
shown<00:00:21.390> it<00:00:21.600> but<00:00:21.840> I<00:00:21.869> didn't<00:00:22.140> have<00:00:22.199> time<00:00:22.519> I<00:00:23.519> used<00:00:23.939> a

00:00:24.080 --> 00:00:24.090 
shown it but I didn't have time I used a

00:00:24.090 --> 00:00:26.290 
shown it but I didn't have time I used a
big<00:00:24.330> ball<00:00:24.630> and<00:00:24.990> I<00:00:25.019> kind<00:00:25.260> of<00:00:25.320> rolled<00:00:25.710> it<00:00:25.949> made<00:00:26.220> a

00:00:26.290 --> 00:00:26.300 
big ball and I kind of rolled it made a

00:00:26.300 --> 00:00:29.330 
big ball and I kind of rolled it made a
nice<00:00:27.300> little<00:00:27.330> center<00:00:27.990> spot<00:00:28.320> for<00:00:28.890> water<00:00:29.130> to

00:00:29.330 --> 00:00:29.340 
nice little center spot for water to

00:00:29.340 --> 00:00:32.389 
nice little center spot for water to
drain<00:00:29.609> and<00:00:29.910> that<00:00:30.410> kind<00:00:31.410> of<00:00:31.439> ran<00:00:31.679> it<00:00:31.890> in<00:00:32.099> three

00:00:32.389 --> 00:00:32.399 
drain and that kind of ran it in three

00:00:32.399 --> 00:00:36.830 
drain and that kind of ran it in three
or<00:00:32.489> four<00:00:32.520> locations<00:00:33.079> so<00:00:34.079> that<00:00:35.450> the<00:00:36.450> outer<00:00:36.600> edge

00:00:36.830 --> 00:00:36.840 
or four locations so that the outer edge

00:00:36.840 --> 00:00:38.330 
or four locations so that the outer edge
would<00:00:37.050> drain<00:00:37.410> to<00:00:37.620> the<00:00:37.649> center<00:00:38.010> if<00:00:38.129> I<00:00:38.250> ever

00:00:38.330 --> 00:00:38.340 
would drain to the center if I ever

00:00:38.340 --> 00:00:41.780 
would drain to the center if I ever
needed<00:00:38.579> to<00:00:38.760> drain<00:00:39.059> it<00:00:39.270> I<00:00:40.140> just<00:00:40.710> used<00:00:40.980> a<00:00:41.070> big<00:00:41.370> I

00:00:41.780 --> 00:00:41.790 
needed to drain it I just used a big I

00:00:41.790 --> 00:00:45.380 
needed to drain it I just used a big I
think<00:00:42.210> it<00:00:42.300> was<00:00:42.450> a<00:00:42.829> made<00:00:43.829> out<00:00:43.920> of<00:00:44.040> marble<00:00:44.370> as<00:00:45.300> a

00:00:45.380 --> 00:00:45.390 
think it was a made out of marble as a

00:00:45.390 --> 00:00:48.680 
think it was a made out of marble as a
big<00:00:45.690> marble<00:00:46.050> ball<00:00:46.410> but<00:00:47.070> I'm<00:00:48.000> not<00:00:48.180> sure<00:00:48.360> that<00:00:48.390> to

00:00:48.680 --> 00:00:48.690 
big marble ball but I'm not sure that to

00:00:48.690 --> 00:00:49.790 
big marble ball but I'm not sure that to
you<00:00:48.780> when<00:00:48.899> I<00:00:48.930> get<00:00:49.079> around<00:00:49.170> on<00:00:49.379> the<00:00:49.410> other<00:00:49.530> edge

00:00:49.790 --> 00:00:49.800 
you when I get around on the other edge

00:00:49.800 --> 00:00:53.330 
you when I get around on the other edge
but<00:00:51.050> anyhow<00:00:52.050> we<00:00:52.079> got<00:00:52.350> everything<00:00:52.530> set<00:00:52.649> on<00:00:53.100> that

00:00:53.330 --> 00:00:53.340 
but anyhow we got everything set on that

00:00:53.340 --> 00:00:55.850 
but anyhow we got everything set on that
circle<00:00:54.239> that<00:00:54.329> we<00:00:54.420> had<00:00:54.510> created<00:00:54.750> with<00:00:55.050> a<00:00:55.110> 2x4

00:00:55.850 --> 00:00:55.860 
circle that we had created with a 2x4

00:00:55.860 --> 00:00:59.660 
circle that we had created with a 2x4
set<00:00:56.789> it<00:00:56.879> up<00:00:57.000> on<00:00:57.149> brick<00:00:57.360> so<00:00:57.629> that<00:00:57.780> that<00:00:58.550> like<00:00:59.550> I

00:00:59.660 --> 00:00:59.670 
set it up on brick so that that like I

00:00:59.670 --> 00:01:02.060 
set it up on brick so that that like I
said<00:00:59.850> it's<00:01:00.000> stone<00:01:00.690> not<00:01:01.559> to<00:01:01.680> worry<00:01:01.770> about<00:01:01.800> them

00:01:02.060 --> 00:01:02.070 
said it's stone not to worry about them

00:01:02.070 --> 00:01:04.820 
said it's stone not to worry about them
sinking<00:01:02.550> as<00:01:02.670> much<00:01:02.879> and<00:01:03.470> it's<00:01:04.470> working<00:01:04.739> really

00:01:04.820 --> 00:01:04.830 
sinking as much and it's working really

00:01:04.830 --> 00:01:06.800 
sinking as much and it's working really
well<00:01:04.949> we<00:01:05.610> do<00:01:05.700> have<00:01:05.850> to<00:01:05.939> adjust<00:01:06.030> the<00:01:06.360> legs<00:01:06.570> and

00:01:06.800 --> 00:01:06.810 
well we do have to adjust the legs and

00:01:06.810 --> 00:01:11.780 
well we do have to adjust the legs and
she<00:01:06.960> fills<00:01:07.260> up<00:01:07.500> it<00:01:08.689> really<00:01:09.689> I<00:01:10.020> expect<00:01:10.790> just

00:01:11.780 --> 00:01:11.790 
she fills up it really I expect just

00:01:11.790 --> 00:01:13.429 
she fills up it really I expect just
like<00:01:11.909> normal<00:01:12.180> take<00:01:12.510> about<00:01:12.659> eight<00:01:12.810> hours<00:01:13.020> but

00:01:13.429 --> 00:01:13.439 
like normal take about eight hours but

00:01:13.439 --> 00:01:15.800 
like normal take about eight hours but
I'm<00:01:13.560> actually<00:01:13.830> going<00:01:14.159> to<00:01:14.250> go<00:01:14.390> pick<00:01:15.390> up<00:01:15.540> another

00:01:15.800 --> 00:01:15.810 
I'm actually going to go pick up another

00:01:15.810 --> 00:01:18.830 
I'm actually going to go pick up another
big<00:01:16.140> hose<00:01:16.439> right<00:01:16.890> off<00:01:17.100> of<00:01:17.130> our<00:01:17.460> well<00:01:18.390> in<00:01:18.689> this

00:01:18.830 --> 00:01:18.840 
big hose right off of our well in this

00:01:18.840 --> 00:01:20.899 
big hose right off of our well in this
case<00:01:19.020> a<00:01:19.080> water<00:01:19.439> well<00:01:19.680> and<00:01:19.920> we're<00:01:20.640> going<00:01:20.759> to<00:01:20.790> get

00:01:20.899 --> 00:01:20.909 
case a water well and we're going to get

00:01:20.909 --> 00:01:23.690 
case a water well and we're going to get
that<00:01:21.150> filled<00:01:22.049> up<00:01:22.200> probably<00:01:22.500> in<00:01:22.740> less<00:01:23.310> than<00:01:23.490> two

00:01:23.690 --> 00:01:23.700 
that filled up probably in less than two

00:01:23.700 --> 00:01:29.480 
that filled up probably in less than two
to<00:01:23.820> three<00:01:24.030> so<00:01:26.210> okay<00:01:27.210> so<00:01:28.159> like<00:01:29.159> I<00:01:29.189> said<00:01:29.369> the

to three so okay so like I said the

00:01:29.490 --> 00:01:39.300 
to three so okay so like I said the
bricks<00:01:30.350> we<00:01:31.350> used<00:01:31.650> a<00:01:31.860> new<00:01:31.890> nylon<00:01:32.759> rope

00:01:39.300 --> 00:01:39.310 

00:01:39.310 --> 00:01:42.360 

got<00:01:39.970> everything<00:01:40.300> set<00:01:40.570> on<00:01:40.690> this<00:01:40.870> edge<00:01:41.080> and<00:01:41.410> as

00:01:42.360 --> 00:01:42.370 
got everything set on this edge and as

00:01:42.370 --> 00:01:52.890 
got everything set on this edge and as
you<00:01:42.520> can<00:01:42.640> see<00:01:45.420> nice<00:01:46.420> and<00:01:46.450> hard<00:01:49.380> and<00:01:51.900> just
