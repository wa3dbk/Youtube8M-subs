00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.620
 today, welcome to 

00:00:01.829 --> 00:00:07.189
 a video of quantum of the seas in 

00:00:04.620 --> 00:00:10.830
 I want to make it very comfortable 

00:00:07.189 --> 00:00:13.440
 fly rapper akon cabin and I thought 

00:00:10.830 --> 00:00:15.839
 show you something actually quite 

00:00:13.440 --> 00:00:18.240
 is exciting and indeed says yes rule 

00:00:15.839 --> 00:00:20.880
 caribbean the whole thing is a smart one here 

00:00:18.240 --> 00:00:22.980
 chip and while there is next to a 

00:00:20.880 --> 00:00:26.160
 own app for this ship chip for 

00:00:22.980 --> 00:00:28.160
 this ship and that is called the role 

00:00:26.160 --> 00:00:30.660
 Cow and we want to look at us 

00:00:28.160 --> 00:00:33.420
 because I can, among other things, with 

00:00:30.660 --> 00:00:36.300
 communicate to other guests and and and 

00:00:33.420 --> 00:00:38.190
 but we'll see more about it as soon as we do 

00:00:36.300 --> 00:00:40.620
 see on which ship cheap quantum 

00:00:38.190 --> 00:00:44.010
 of the seas I have to get up there 

00:00:40.620 --> 00:00:45.450
 be logged in the wlan of this 

00:00:44.010 --> 00:00:47.730
 ship otherwise the whole thing works 

00:00:45.450 --> 00:00:49.950
 not so at home or so i can 

00:00:47.730 --> 00:00:50.820
 do not try it so now we look 

00:00:49.950 --> 00:00:52.440
 I may want to have it today 

00:00:50.820 --> 00:00:55.469
 book a table in the evening click here 

00:00:52.440 --> 00:00:57.870
 on your see now all we are 

00:00:55.469 --> 00:01:00.420
 on day 2 on the day 2 where we only on 

00:00:57.870 --> 00:01:02.280
 Cruises are so to speak and we drive 

00:01:00.420 --> 00:01:04.530
 through the area and now I can 

00:01:02.280 --> 00:01:07.020
 say, for example, mail reservations 

00:01:04.530 --> 00:01:09.060
 we are going to make this whole up to date for me 

00:01:07.020 --> 00:01:13.020
 then stands a secret old 38 

00:01:09.060 --> 00:01:16.700
 works yes god right now so say 

00:01:13.020 --> 00:01:18.840
 we select and now I say nothing like that 

00:01:16.700 --> 00:01:20.460
 and now I could say and how much 

00:01:18.840 --> 00:01:22.170
 I want to eat something before I go 

00:01:20.460 --> 00:01:24.439
 somewhere in brazil can turn 17 after 

00:01:22.170 --> 00:01:27.540
 Clock is of course too early 

00:01:24.439 --> 00:01:28.829
 Let's take 18 o'clock 30 with us 

00:01:27.540 --> 00:01:29.670
 the realistically what 

00:01:28.829 --> 00:01:31.860
 is shown 

00:01:29.670 --> 00:01:34.970
 so and now let's see if you then 

00:01:31.860 --> 00:01:34.970
 Some suggestions come 

00:01:36.740 --> 00:01:42.930
 there it is now so far so now could 

00:01:41.189 --> 00:01:44.520
 I reserve the brother we see the 

00:01:42.930 --> 00:01:46.820
 Times are already in short supply 

00:01:44.520 --> 00:01:48.899
 free restaurants american icon 

00:01:46.820 --> 00:01:51.210
 krejcik under grander they are all 

00:01:48.899 --> 00:01:53.970
 free or I could 

00:01:51.210 --> 00:01:55.890
 theoretically specialties restaurants 

00:01:53.970 --> 00:01:59.280
 serve that is also this press 

00:01:55.890 --> 00:02:00.869
 and and travel agency do not travel because there 

00:01:59.280 --> 00:02:02.820
 then in the specialties restaurants 

00:02:00.869 --> 00:02:04.140
 only people with special deposits are allowed 

00:02:02.820 --> 00:02:06.390
 So we can be tonight 

00:02:04.140 --> 00:02:08.729
 we show here in this level i 

00:02:06.390 --> 00:02:10.979
 Therefore, decadence only has to be given 

00:02:08.729 --> 00:02:12.900
 500 kilocalories so special 

00:02:10.979 --> 00:02:13.260
 But I am not calorie-conscious 

00:02:12.900 --> 00:02:15.300
 bad 

00:02:13.260 --> 00:02:16.620
 So I can easily book this 

00:02:15.300 --> 00:02:17.970
 when I choose the tournament 

00:02:16.620 --> 00:02:21.420
 what else can we do? 

00:02:17.970 --> 00:02:23.820
 Just go back and chance 

00:02:21.420 --> 00:02:24.900
 entertainment and a 

00:02:23.820 --> 00:02:26.550
 exciting question 

00:02:24.900 --> 00:02:27.959
 so far I have not booked anything 

00:02:26.550 --> 00:02:31.020
 I could stop here and now 

00:02:27.959 --> 00:02:33.150
 For example, Mum shot Mom 

00:02:31.020 --> 00:02:36.360
 mia there we already see the lasts 150 

00:02:33.150 --> 00:02:38.820
 minutes so two and a half hours pure 

00:02:36.360 --> 00:02:40.830
 Madness is the original show star 

00:02:38.820 --> 00:02:44.550
 Water is the show in the tussi 

00:02:40.830 --> 00:02:46.650
 lounge in the spectacular event 

00:02:44.550 --> 00:02:50.910
 then you also say install okay 

00:02:46.650 --> 00:02:52.709
 say next and then can your date 

00:02:50.910 --> 00:02:55.739
 and select time so that works 

00:02:52.709 --> 00:02:57.480
 So all in the end, that's clear 

00:02:55.739 --> 00:03:00.360
 someday so sold the addition 

00:02:57.480 --> 00:03:02.130
 that's legitimate because a row one 

00:03:00.360 --> 00:03:04.320
 shipping company does not do it all 

00:03:02.130 --> 00:03:06.030
 for fun but it is synonymous money 

00:03:04.320 --> 00:03:08.250
 so I still have that 

00:03:06.030 --> 00:03:12.950
 possibility of further onboard activities 

00:03:08.250 --> 00:03:15.510
 So that's the chance you 're okay now 

00:03:12.950 --> 00:03:17.340
 What else can I have my statement there 

00:03:15.510 --> 00:03:19.110
 So I look at how much money that 

00:03:17.340 --> 00:03:22.079
 already spent there we see here 

00:03:19.110 --> 00:03:25.650
 in the morning again sparingly 90 dollars 

00:03:22.079 --> 00:03:27.959
 So far, nothing is the whole thing 

00:03:25.650 --> 00:03:31.680
 the stand of 15 43 and that's it 

00:03:27.959 --> 00:03:33.600
 exactly the time so everything is so far 

00:03:31.680 --> 00:03:35.190
 I can do everything so well here 

00:03:33.600 --> 00:03:39.630
 Here I have my own 

00:03:35.190 --> 00:03:41.250
 calendar there's nothing about the ratings 

00:03:39.630 --> 00:03:43.079
 stadium photo day so not yet to 

00:03:41.250 --> 00:03:44.760
 Calendar would be there for me now 

00:03:43.079 --> 00:03:46.470
 like your opinion so interested 

00:03:44.760 --> 00:03:47.970
 how do you like that you would like 

00:03:46.470 --> 00:03:50.340
 lead a calendar 

00:03:47.970 --> 00:03:52.049
 during a cruise or says that 

00:03:50.340 --> 00:03:54.120
 I do not have any revenge on that 

00:03:52.049 --> 00:03:56.000
 I just want to do it 

00:03:54.120 --> 00:03:57.950
 actually make it reasonably spontaneous 

00:03:56.000 --> 00:04:00.000
 means stop that under circumstances 

00:03:57.950 --> 00:04:01.410
 every now and then five minutes 

00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:03.540
 but it has to wait that is it 

00:04:01.410 --> 00:04:05.970
 So what do you say I am 

00:04:03.540 --> 00:04:08.250
 to design a little bit I think so I 

00:04:05.970 --> 00:04:09.450
 am someone who can appoint dates in the media 

00:04:08.250 --> 00:04:11.060
 you make very good appointments also privately 

00:04:09.450 --> 00:04:12.590
 So friends or 

00:04:11.060 --> 00:04:15.680
 you say so and two weeks and 

00:04:12.590 --> 00:04:16.669
 Tuesday around 1915 I have time but I 

00:04:15.680 --> 00:04:18.799
 at all no problem-is it a 

00:04:16.669 --> 00:04:21.260
 to wear but on such a journey I travel like that 

00:04:18.799 --> 00:04:22.460
 If you want that, yes, it's always enough for me 

00:04:21.260 --> 00:04:23.570
 already if I am somewhere 

00:04:22.460 --> 00:04:24.740
 What must I write down for a country 

00:04:23.570 --> 00:04:26.210
 booked from flight and when not 

00:04:24.740 --> 00:04:27.710
 must be somewhere or on the internet 

00:04:26.210 --> 00:04:29.540
 specialty restaurant but if then 

00:04:27.710 --> 00:04:31.220
 so the whole chance to come or something 

00:04:29.540 --> 00:04:32.570
 yes, good by having to be less 

00:04:31.220 --> 00:04:34.970
 I write it down in the app 

00:04:32.570 --> 00:04:37.130
 but I do not know what else 

00:04:34.970 --> 00:04:39.169
 interesting is when I'm with others 

00:04:37.130 --> 00:04:41.360
 People will get into touch 

00:04:39.169 --> 00:04:44.590
 who are here on the ship can then 

00:04:41.360 --> 00:04:46.090
 I write with the one or the other 

00:04:44.590 --> 00:04:49.010
 to phone 

00:04:46.090 --> 00:04:50.780
 So now I have my extension 

00:04:49.010 --> 00:04:53.540
 Then you get a six-digit 

00:04:50.780 --> 00:04:56.000
 Number where the numbers are in the middle 75 

00:04:53.540 --> 00:04:57.889
 74 the cabins are number and now 

00:04:56.000 --> 00:05:00.229
 Can I write someone here? 

00:04:57.889 --> 00:05:01.550
 usually yes race is here so 

00:05:00.229 --> 00:05:03.290
 that seems outside of this 

00:05:01.550 --> 00:05:03.800
 launch phase quite also money to 

00:05:03.290 --> 00:05:06.110
 look 

00:05:03.800 --> 00:05:07.100
 to cost more information 

00:05:06.110 --> 00:05:09.620
 we are not there yet 

00:05:07.100 --> 00:05:12.200
 Now I say bye package how to 

00:05:09.620 --> 00:05:18.729
 for $ 0 you do not go wrong 

00:05:12.200 --> 00:05:23.650
 So now I can write 

00:05:18.729 --> 00:05:29.090
 hello test or something 

00:05:23.650 --> 00:05:35.690
 hello test so grab another smiley 

00:05:29.090 --> 00:05:38.210
 afterward extension of line is so 

00:05:35.690 --> 00:05:40.010
 that is, melanie columbus I 

00:05:38.210 --> 00:05:42.110
 now just wrote the 

00:05:40.010 --> 00:05:45.380
 apparently does not seem to be online too 

00:05:42.110 --> 00:05:46.669
 By the way, he is not related 

00:05:45.380 --> 00:05:47.870
 probably also maybe on it 

00:05:46.669 --> 00:05:49.520
 how christoph columbus is related 

00:05:47.870 --> 00:05:52.729
 it does not prove it to the ladies with everything 

00:05:49.520 --> 00:05:54.470
 calculate well then alternative would be just too 

00:05:52.729 --> 00:05:58.490
 just call it all about that 

00:05:54.470 --> 00:06:00.470
 on-board without me now big without 

00:05:58.490 --> 00:06:02.030
 that I now use my mobile network big 

00:06:00.470 --> 00:06:03.110
 what must always be expensive on board so 

00:06:02.030 --> 00:06:05.450
 is actually priceless 

00:06:03.110 --> 00:06:08.419
 this is a separate system in principle 

00:06:05.450 --> 00:06:10.430
 exciting how the whole thing works 

00:06:08.419 --> 00:06:12.860
 we will see in detail yes onboard 

00:06:10.430 --> 00:06:14.979
 So I have directory now 

00:06:12.860 --> 00:06:18.460
 Yesterday I can even call you 

00:06:14.979 --> 00:06:22.520
 due to get back on my god so 

00:06:18.460 --> 00:06:23.900
 you can get directions by phone 

00:06:22.520 --> 00:06:25.729
 they just want to see what 

00:06:23.900 --> 00:06:37.370
 happens when you can because sometimes it calls 

00:06:25.729 --> 00:06:40.240
 make the speaker so no yes 

00:06:37.370 --> 00:06:40.240
 free sign or something 

00:06:42.230 --> 00:06:48.330
 worth a try I thought we had 

00:06:46.470 --> 00:06:51.960
 could have two leisure or something like that 

00:06:48.330 --> 00:06:53.880
 was that again rita thies was that 

00:06:51.960 --> 00:06:55.650
 is now the demonstration effect that can 

00:06:53.880 --> 00:06:58.320
 just be that in the moment 

00:06:55.650 --> 00:07:00.630
 not yet worked that way though 

00:06:58.320 --> 00:07:03.750
 Of course, in principle, welcome and 

00:07:00.630 --> 00:07:05.340
 So practically people so I have to 

00:07:03.750 --> 00:07:07.350
 as all register there are so obviously 

00:07:05.340 --> 00:07:10.110
 no directory where now the whole 

00:07:07.350 --> 00:07:14.880
 ship's kind since the whole 

00:07:10.110 --> 00:07:17.520
 ship is so good royal iq 

00:07:14.880 --> 00:07:18.990
 so calendar lead on the 

00:07:17.520 --> 00:07:20.760
 cruise ship so write me your 

00:07:18.990 --> 00:07:23.580
 opinion in the comments 

00:07:20.760 --> 00:07:25.170
 and what do you think about that 

00:07:23.580 --> 00:07:27.300
 I'm curious what an app 

00:07:25.170 --> 00:07:28.590
 they say so yes I am now 

00:07:27.300 --> 00:07:30.660
 back on and make me back to the 

00:07:28.590 --> 00:07:31.830
 work or whatever it's good for 

00:07:30.660 --> 00:07:34.770
 Until next time 

00:07:31.830 --> 00:07:38.240
 achja travel like to book via the link 

00:07:34.770 --> 00:07:38.240
