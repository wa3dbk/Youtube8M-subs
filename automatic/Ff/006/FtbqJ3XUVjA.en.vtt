00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.210
 hello and welcome back to 

00:00:02.340 --> 00:00:06.060
 collector world 

00:00:03.210 --> 00:00:08.700
 You wanted a map update you get 

00:00:06.060 --> 00:00:13.639
 that is basically the first update 

00:00:08.700 --> 00:00:16.350
 now here for the dfb team quartz 2010 

00:00:13.639 --> 00:00:17.369
 yes there is no right wallet for it 

00:00:16.350 --> 00:00:19.410
 In any case, I do not think that's why 

00:00:17.369 --> 00:00:20.640
 I first here as a standard 

00:00:19.410 --> 00:00:24.240
 Wallet taken for the whole collection 

00:00:20.640 --> 00:00:25.769
 series of tops and panini, however 

00:00:24.240 --> 00:00:28.260
 is not really quite see the 

00:00:25.769 --> 00:00:30.060
 See, you'll do the whole thing here later 

00:00:28.260 --> 00:00:33.739
 first page I have completely full here 

00:00:30.060 --> 00:00:37.649
 there are new ones in eagle meadow 

00:00:33.739 --> 00:00:43.879
 Westermann Schweinsteiger Friedrich &amp; 

00:00:37.649 --> 00:00:43.879
 water the backs are always complete 

00:00:43.920 --> 00:00:48.000
 this sting here is schweinsteiger 

00:00:46.739 --> 00:00:49.579
 not at all on the first page I have 

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:51.660
 the first page I can fully my goodness 

00:00:49.579 --> 00:00:54.090
 Schweinsteiger is first in front of the second 

00:00:51.660 --> 00:00:54.960
 I still have a page on the second page 

00:00:54.090 --> 00:00:56.489
 not completely full 

00:00:54.960 --> 00:00:59.760
 many cards are actually happy about that 

00:00:56.489 --> 00:01:04.080
 even here I have it full 

00:00:59.760 --> 00:01:13.140
 the side joachim lion dieter flick 

00:01:04.080 --> 00:01:17.250
 andreas kÃ¶pke and the whole action 

00:01:13.140 --> 00:01:22.470
 cards in principle there are right me 

00:01:17.250 --> 00:01:23.970
 many really correct many and then at 

00:01:22.470 --> 00:01:26.810
 the team picture does not work out 

00:01:23.970 --> 00:01:29.280
 So that's five wide you can see 

00:01:26.810 --> 00:01:31.229
 Here's the principle here 

00:01:29.280 --> 00:01:36.270
 cut off because it just now five the 

00:01:31.229 --> 00:01:37.110
 can file anyway so that was one 

00:01:36.270 --> 00:01:38.790
 That's why I have that 

00:01:37.110 --> 00:01:40.560
 tried paper no matter how one action 

00:01:38.790 --> 00:01:42.990
 card still in between that it is possible 

00:01:40.560 --> 00:01:44.549
 Filled looks on this page 

00:01:42.990 --> 00:01:45.930
 he even has some reason then here 

00:01:44.549 --> 00:01:47.790
 German football league still to see the 

00:01:45.930 --> 00:01:50.490
 back in principle then it works that 

00:01:47.790 --> 00:01:53.490
 I think that's good, that's opposite 

00:01:50.490 --> 00:01:55.829
 grab that looks okay here yet 

00:01:53.490 --> 00:01:58.100
 more action cards or cheers 

00:01:55.829 --> 00:02:00.390
 cards are that I believe 

00:01:58.100 --> 00:02:03.110
 germany gives from both perspectives 

00:02:00.390 --> 00:02:03.110
 Which 

00:02:04.110 --> 00:02:12.210
 and then the first round of the match 

00:02:09.420 --> 00:02:14.220
 normal game plan to back the 

00:02:12.210 --> 00:02:17.780
 Team picture here are copies of 

00:02:14.220 --> 00:02:22.860
 back and then the checklist yet 

00:02:17.780 --> 00:02:25.530
 checklist I have the jersey on it 

00:02:22.860 --> 00:02:28.050
 on the checklist of the hall with her 

00:02:25.530 --> 00:02:29.250
 card with original dfb jersey me that 

00:02:28.050 --> 00:02:31.890
 would consider again any time in the 

00:02:29.250 --> 00:02:33.630
 Of course it would be awesome but it was one 

00:02:31.890 --> 00:02:37.970
 you once wanted her to have a little update 

00:02:33.630 --> 00:02:37.970
 get one until next time bye
