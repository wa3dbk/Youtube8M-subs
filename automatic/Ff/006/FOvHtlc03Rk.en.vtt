00:00:01.890 --> 00:00:07.169
 well we are here at the asus stand 

00:00:05.190 --> 00:00:09.360
 Knowing your new product this 

00:00:07.169 --> 00:00:11.550
 presented here in Barcelona that is the pad 

00:00:09.360 --> 00:00:14.130
 with infinity this is a combination 

00:00:11.550 --> 00:00:16.109
 between 10.1-inch tablet and a 

00:00:14.130 --> 00:00:18.060
 5-inch phone let's go to why 

00:00:16.109 --> 00:00:19.710
 it is a combination the specifications 

00:00:18.060 --> 00:00:22.320
 they are quite impressive it comes with 

00:00:19.710 --> 00:00:25.980
 android 4.2 of living a processor 

00:00:22.320 --> 00:00:28.739
 7.7 giga snapdragon of qualcomm 

00:00:25.980 --> 00:00:31.650
 hertz or four cores 2 gigas of ram and 

00:00:28.739 --> 00:00:33.750
 between 32 and 64 gigas capacity 

00:00:31.650 --> 00:00:38.399
 screen is 10.1 inches as they 

00:00:33.750 --> 00:00:40.289
 had commented and the 1080 p is full hd and 

00:00:38.399 --> 00:00:43.550
 what is striking about this is that 

00:00:40.289 --> 00:00:43.550
 because I can work for example 

00:00:43.920 --> 00:00:49.140
 the cable that would give me up to 410 hours 

00:00:46.769 --> 00:00:53.010
 of time I had 

00:00:49.140 --> 00:00:55.550
 or work on cell phone is 5 

00:00:53.010 --> 00:00:58.739
 inches is also 1080 p has 

00:00:55.550 --> 00:01:02.760
 dependence on the charger more or less 

00:00:58.739 --> 00:01:05.070
 20 hours on 3g networks is also 

00:01:02.760 --> 00:01:07.200
 they basically share the components 

00:01:05.070 --> 00:01:09.630
 from here we have the same however 

00:01:07.200 --> 00:01:12.180
 the one here we have the camera the camera 

00:01:09.630 --> 00:01:13.960
 of 3 megapixels with an opening of that 

00:01:12.180 --> 00:01:15.520
 two 

00:01:13.960 --> 00:01:18.369
 here we go inside is a little bit 

00:01:15.520 --> 00:01:21.130
 how the device works as they can 

00:01:18.369 --> 00:01:23.350
 see the finished device is everything 

00:01:21.130 --> 00:01:25.780
 in aluminum we live precious is a single 

00:01:23.350 --> 00:01:28.869
 body on the rounded edges that 

00:01:25.780 --> 00:01:30.800
 you see quite pretty well and this income 

00:01:28.869 --> 00:01:32.300
 A) Yes 

00:01:30.800 --> 00:01:33.590
 and that's when one can be of 

00:01:32.300 --> 00:01:36.020
 immediately transfer what has the 

00:01:33.590 --> 00:01:38.660
 phone to the tablet screen but 

00:01:36.020 --> 00:01:42.430
 not only that also according to fusades a 

00:01:38.660 --> 00:01:42.430
 great innovation of this device 

00:01:44.200 --> 00:01:50.110
 this antenna that is supposedly the nfc 

00:01:47.590 --> 00:01:51.909
 and the cell phone antenna so that then 

00:01:50.110 --> 00:01:54.549
 so on the outside the phone although they look 

00:01:51.909 --> 00:01:56.200
 the idea is good and that do not interfere 

00:01:54.549 --> 00:01:57.939
 metal in the aluminum that is a single 

00:01:56.200 --> 00:02:00.750
 body that look like I tell them is 

00:01:57.939 --> 00:02:03.120
 truly extraordinary manufacturing 

00:02:00.750 --> 00:02:04.950
 and the idea is not to interfere is is 

00:02:03.120 --> 00:02:07.050
 the metal as it is with the performance of 

00:02:04.950 --> 00:02:08.880
 the cellular antenna as this is the most 

00:02:07.050 --> 00:02:11.910
 new asos this device is 

00:02:08.880 --> 00:02:15.920
 costing more or less a thousand euros and will be 

00:02:11.910 --> 00:02:15.920
 available then in the next months
