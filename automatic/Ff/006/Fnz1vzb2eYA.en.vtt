00:00:01.460 --> 00:00:06.810
 so here is a little technique for 

00:00:03.990 --> 00:00:10.620
 gain experience on a justice 

00:00:06.810 --> 00:00:13.769
 it's taking batman and going into 

00:00:10.620 --> 00:00:16.260
 the world 2 aquaman that's actually the goal 

00:00:13.769 --> 00:00:20.430
 is to take batman gets to the level 

00:00:16.260 --> 00:00:24.000
 of the bubble that we see here the justice there 

00:00:20.430 --> 00:00:25.039
 is to jump indefinitely actually into 

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:27.480
 mode versus 

00:00:25.039 --> 00:00:29.880
 so here is the time there is a finite like 

00:00:27.480 --> 00:00:31.820
 you can see it and so that's it and 

00:00:29.880 --> 00:00:36.059
 jump because I actually noticed 

00:00:31.820 --> 00:00:37.170
 we could use decorations etc. 

00:00:36.059 --> 00:00:40.680
 it's giving experience points 

00:00:37.170 --> 00:00:43.649
 so since we have infinite time and that 

00:00:40.680 --> 00:00:46.530
 ben batman does not destroy the bubble on 

00:00:43.649 --> 00:00:48.840
 can use it indefinitely so that's it 

00:00:46.530 --> 00:00:52.410
 it's been two hours since I'm above 

00:00:48.840 --> 00:00:53.309
 we use batman and everything so we go 

00:00:52.410 --> 00:00:56.070
 look at the number of points 

00:00:53.309 --> 00:00:57.870
 of experience that I gained in range 

00:00:56.070 --> 00:01:01.829
 so that's the way I had benefited for 

00:00:57.870 --> 00:01:06.479
 mount my gauge thoroughly and let the 

00:01:01.829 --> 00:01:08.340
 joker with very little life so we go 

00:01:06.479 --> 00:01:11.130
 see what confident and I won from 

00:01:08.340 --> 00:01:19.460
 the experience in two hours in advantage 

00:01:11.130 --> 00:01:19.460
 one goes to the juke r here 

00:01:25.579 --> 00:01:31.399
 with with a little support for the 

00:01:29.189 --> 00:01:31.399
 pleasure 

00:01:32.090 --> 00:01:36.170
 here with paypal line 

00:01:43.020 --> 00:01:48.640
 here on one side I prefer to say I have 

00:01:46.870 --> 00:01:50.520
 did a little experience of foix iii 

00:01:48.640 --> 00:01:53.410
 that you can see here 

00:01:50.520 --> 00:01:59.590
 so that's the name of experience that I 

00:01:53.410 --> 00:02:01.330
 win and here we see well and here we go 

00:01:59.590 --> 00:02:03.270
 what I earned in two hours Belgian 

00:02:01.330 --> 00:02:07.270
 is mounted four levels within two hours 

00:02:03.270 --> 00:02:10.630
 which is already not too bad what if we 

00:02:07.270 --> 00:02:12.790
 do this for indefinitely during not 

00:02:10.630 --> 00:02:15.070
 a lot of hours it makes you win a lot of 

00:02:12.790 --> 00:02:17.280
 points here so I'm going to try to 

00:02:15.070 --> 00:02:20.590
 continue climbing to level 100 

00:02:17.280 --> 00:02:23.850
 plants a possible mango that's going 

00:02:20.590 --> 00:02:23.850
 ciao everyone
