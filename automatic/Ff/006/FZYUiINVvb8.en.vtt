00:00:46.790 --> 00:00:46.800 
leather jacket iron leggings and then

00:00:46.800 --> 00:00:49.010 
leather jacket iron leggings and then
the<00:00:46.920> golden<00:00:47.219> boots<00:00:47.399> I'm<00:00:47.640> sure<00:00:48.270> that<00:00:48.510> look<00:00:48.750> is

00:00:49.010 --> 00:00:49.020 
the golden boots I'm sure that look is

00:00:49.020 --> 00:00:50.750 
the golden boots I'm sure that look is
gonna<00:00:49.379> work<00:00:49.680> for<00:00:49.890> at<00:00:50.010> least<00:00:50.190> some<00:00:50.370> of<00:00:50.399> you<00:00:50.610> on

00:00:50.750 --> 00:00:50.760 
gonna work for at least some of you on

00:00:50.760 --> 00:00:52.520 
gonna work for at least some of you on
top<00:00:51.300> of<00:00:51.329> that<00:00:51.510> you<00:00:51.660> can<00:00:51.809> also<00:00:51.930> extend<00:00:52.410> this

00:00:52.520 --> 00:00:52.530 
top of that you can also extend this

00:00:52.530 --> 00:00:54.229 
top of that you can also extend this
design<00:00:52.860> so<00:00:53.039> you<00:00:53.070> could<00:00:53.190> have<00:00:53.309> more<00:00:53.550> variations

00:00:54.229 --> 00:00:54.239 
design so you could have more variations

00:00:54.239 --> 00:00:56.319 
design so you could have more variations
of<00:00:54.360> armor<00:00:54.629> which<00:00:54.960> i<00:00:55.110> think<00:00:55.170> is<00:00:55.469> pretty<00:00:55.620> cool<00:00:55.890> if

00:00:56.319 --> 00:00:56.329 
of armor which i think is pretty cool if

00:00:56.329 --> 00:00:58.760 
of armor which i think is pretty cool if
we<00:00:57.329> head<00:00:57.449> around<00:00:57.629> the<00:00:57.750> back<00:00:57.899> you<00:00:57.930> can<00:00:58.289> see<00:00:58.559> all

00:00:58.760 --> 00:00:58.770 
we head around the back you can see all

00:00:58.770 --> 00:01:00.260 
we head around the back you can see all
of<00:00:58.800> the<00:00:58.949> Redstone<00:00:59.370> behind<00:00:59.640> it<00:00:59.789> and<00:00:59.969> quite

00:01:00.260 --> 00:01:00.270 
of the Redstone behind it and quite

00:01:00.270 --> 00:01:02.840 
of the Redstone behind it and quite
clearly<00:01:00.570> it<00:01:01.079> uses<00:01:01.770> a<00:01:01.800> lot<00:01:01.980> of<00:01:02.039> hoppers<00:01:02.280> this<00:01:02.699> is

00:01:02.840 --> 00:01:02.850 
clearly it uses a lot of hoppers this is

00:01:02.850 --> 00:01:05.000 
clearly it uses a lot of hoppers this is
going<00:01:03.059> to<00:01:03.149> use<00:01:03.329> up<00:01:03.510> a<00:01:03.690> ton<00:01:04.019> of<00:01:04.049> iron<00:01:04.500> so<00:01:04.769> that<00:01:04.799> is

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:05.010 
going to use up a ton of iron so that is

00:01:05.010 --> 00:01:05.690 
going to use up a ton of iron so that is
just<00:01:05.220> something<00:01:05.339> to<00:01:05.519> take<00:01:05.670> into

00:01:05.690 --> 00:01:05.700 
just something to take into

00:01:05.700 --> 00:01:07.850 
just something to take into
consideration<00:01:05.939> if<00:01:06.810> you<00:01:07.140> plan<00:01:07.380> on<00:01:07.409> building

00:01:07.850 --> 00:01:07.860 
consideration if you plan on building

00:01:07.860 --> 00:01:09.770 
consideration if you plan on building
this<00:01:07.950> on<00:01:08.159> the<00:01:08.250> first<00:01:08.460> day<00:01:08.700> I<00:01:08.970> wouldn't

00:01:09.770 --> 00:01:09.780 
this on the first day I wouldn't

00:01:09.780 --> 00:01:11.510 
this on the first day I wouldn't
necessarily<00:01:09.930> suggest<00:01:10.740> it<00:01:10.920> but<00:01:11.100> if<00:01:11.220> you've<00:01:11.369> got

00:01:11.510 --> 00:01:11.520 
necessarily suggest it but if you've got

00:01:11.520 --> 00:01:12.980 
necessarily suggest it but if you've got
yourself<00:01:11.820> set<00:01:11.970> up<00:01:12.150> with<00:01:12.330> some<00:01:12.510> form<00:01:12.689> of<00:01:12.780> iron

00:01:12.980 --> 00:01:12.990 
yourself set up with some form of iron

00:01:12.990 --> 00:01:14.929 
yourself set up with some form of iron
farm<00:01:13.350> or<00:01:13.560> you've<00:01:13.979> done<00:01:14.159> a<00:01:14.220> decent<00:01:14.729> amount<00:01:14.790> of

00:01:14.929 --> 00:01:14.939 
farm or you've done a decent amount of

00:01:14.939 --> 00:01:16.399 
farm or you've done a decent amount of
mining<00:01:15.330> then<00:01:15.689> you<00:01:15.810> shouldn't<00:01:16.049> have<00:01:16.200> any

00:01:16.399 --> 00:01:16.409 
mining then you shouldn't have any

00:01:16.409 --> 00:01:17.990 
mining then you shouldn't have any
trouble<00:01:16.500> because<00:01:17.009> the<00:01:17.159> system<00:01:17.490> itself<00:01:17.610> is

00:01:17.990 --> 00:01:18.000 
trouble because the system itself is

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:20.719 
trouble because the system itself is
actually<00:01:18.810> very<00:01:19.020> simple<00:01:19.409> indeed<00:01:19.710> all<00:01:20.159> we<00:01:20.520> have

00:01:20.719 --> 00:01:20.729 
actually very simple indeed all we have

00:01:20.729 --> 00:01:22.670 
actually very simple indeed all we have
is<00:01:20.909> a<00:01:21.030> bunch<00:01:21.240> of<00:01:21.330> droppers<00:01:21.720> filled<00:01:22.259> up<00:01:22.470> to<00:01:22.650> the

00:01:22.670 --> 00:01:22.680 
is a bunch of droppers filled up to the

00:01:22.680 --> 00:01:24.499 
is a bunch of droppers filled up to the
brim<00:01:22.770> up<00:01:23.189> with<00:01:23.340> various<00:01:23.759> different<00:01:23.970> pieces<00:01:24.270> of

brim up with various different pieces of

brim up with various different pieces of
armor<00:01:24.780> they<00:01:25.170> then<00:01:25.380> get<00:01:25.530> dropped<00:01:25.830> out<00:01:26.009> into<00:01:26.460> the

00:01:26.539 --> 00:01:26.549 
armor they then get dropped out into the

00:01:26.549 --> 00:01:28.490 
armor they then get dropped out into the
hoppers<00:01:26.880> continue<00:01:27.570> along<00:01:27.780> into<00:01:28.140> the<00:01:28.229> middle

00:01:28.490 --> 00:01:28.500 
hoppers continue along into the middle

00:01:28.500 --> 00:01:29.840 
hoppers continue along into the middle
in<00:01:28.650> which<00:01:28.799> we<00:01:28.950> have<00:01:29.100> the<00:01:29.220> armor<00:01:29.490> equipping

in which we have the armor equipping
station<00:01:30.240> they<00:01:30.600> drop<00:01:30.869> down<00:01:31.110> into<00:01:31.350> the

00:01:31.490 --> 00:01:31.500 
station they drop down into the

00:01:31.500 --> 00:01:33.050 
station they drop down into the
dispensers<00:01:32.100> then<00:01:32.460> when<00:01:32.640> we<00:01:32.729> hit<00:01:32.850> the<00:01:32.939> button

00:01:33.050 --> 00:01:33.060 
dispensers then when we hit the button

00:01:33.060 --> 00:01:35.330 
dispensers then when we hit the button
it<00:01:33.420> is<00:01:33.540> equipped<00:01:33.810> onto<00:01:34.110> us<00:01:34.259> and<00:01:34.500> that<00:01:35.009> is<00:01:35.310> the

00:01:35.330 --> 00:01:35.340 
it is equipped onto us and that is the

00:01:35.340 --> 00:01:37.370 
it is equipped onto us and that is the
whole<00:01:35.640> system<00:01:35.850> done<00:01:36.270> so<00:01:36.720> let's<00:01:36.960> take<00:01:37.140> a<00:01:37.170> look

00:01:37.370 --> 00:01:37.380 
whole system done so let's take a look

00:01:37.380 --> 00:01:41.899 
whole system done so let's take a look
at<00:01:37.740> how<00:01:37.950> to<00:01:38.009> build<00:01:38.340> it<00:01:40.400> so<00:01:41.400> you<00:01:41.460> want<00:01:41.729> to<00:01:41.790> get

00:01:41.899 --> 00:01:41.909 
at how to build it so you want to get

00:01:41.909 --> 00:01:44.030 
at how to build it so you want to get
things<00:01:42.060> stove<00:01:42.390> with<00:01:42.689> a<00:01:42.720> seven<00:01:43.259> by<00:01:43.380> four<00:01:43.439> area

00:01:44.030 --> 00:01:44.040 
things stove with a seven by four area

00:01:44.040 --> 00:01:45.380 
things stove with a seven by four area
the<00:01:44.220> first<00:01:44.460> thing<00:01:44.729> that<00:01:44.820> you<00:01:44.880> want<00:01:45.000> to<00:01:45.060> do<00:01:45.180> is

00:01:45.380 --> 00:01:45.390 
the first thing that you want to do is

00:01:45.390 --> 00:01:46.850 
the first thing that you want to do is
place<00:01:45.630> three<00:01:45.869> blocks<00:01:46.110> across<00:01:46.320> like<00:01:46.530> this<00:01:46.680> and

00:01:46.850 --> 00:01:46.860 
place three blocks across like this and

00:01:46.860 --> 00:01:49.249 
place three blocks across like this and
three<00:01:47.670> blocks<00:01:47.909> across<00:01:48.210> like<00:01:48.509> that<00:01:48.540> then<00:01:49.079> next

00:01:49.249 --> 00:01:49.259 
three blocks across like that then next

00:01:49.259 --> 00:01:51.139 
three blocks across like that then next
up<00:01:49.439> you<00:01:49.590> want<00:01:49.770> to<00:01:49.829> go<00:01:49.920> two<00:01:49.979> by<00:01:50.399> three<00:01:50.729> here<00:01:50.939> and

00:01:51.139 --> 00:01:51.149 
up you want to go two by three here and

00:01:51.149 --> 00:01:53.539 
up you want to go two by three here and
then<00:01:51.780> another<00:01:51.990> two<00:01:52.500> by<00:01:52.680> three<00:01:53.009> on<00:01:53.159> this<00:01:53.340> side

00:01:53.539 --> 00:01:53.549 
then another two by three on this side

00:01:53.549 --> 00:01:55.460 
then another two by three on this side
it's<00:01:53.970> going<00:01:54.149> to<00:01:54.210> be<00:01:54.329> a<00:01:54.360> pretty<00:01:54.810> symmetrical

00:01:55.460 --> 00:01:55.470 
it's going to be a pretty symmetrical

00:01:55.470 --> 00:01:56.600 
it's going to be a pretty symmetrical
build<00:01:55.680> so<00:01:55.860> that's<00:01:56.040> just<00:01:56.159> something<00:01:56.369> to<00:01:56.460> keep

00:01:56.600 --> 00:01:56.610 
build so that's just something to keep

00:01:56.610 --> 00:01:58.069 
build so that's just something to keep
in<00:01:56.759> mind<00:01:56.790> and<00:01:57.149> then<00:01:57.450> you<00:01:57.509> want<00:01:57.659> to<00:01:57.719> go<00:01:57.810> three

00:01:58.069 --> 00:01:58.079 
in mind and then you want to go three

00:01:58.079 --> 00:02:00.080 
in mind and then you want to go three
blocks<00:01:58.110> across<00:01:58.560> like<00:01:58.740> this<00:01:58.860> and<00:01:59.040> three<00:01:59.820> blocks

00:02:00.080 --> 00:02:00.090 
blocks across like this and three blocks

00:02:00.090 --> 00:02:01.969 
blocks across like this and three blocks
across<00:02:00.390> on<00:02:00.689> the<00:02:00.810> other<00:02:00.840> side<00:02:01.290> then<00:02:01.770> you<00:02:01.860> want

00:02:01.969 --> 00:02:01.979 
across on the other side then you want

00:02:01.979 --> 00:02:03.740 
across on the other side then you want
to<00:02:02.009> place<00:02:02.189> two<00:02:02.399> buttons<00:02:02.729> here<00:02:02.939> two<00:02:03.360> buttons

00:02:03.740 --> 00:02:03.750 
to place two buttons here two buttons

00:02:03.750 --> 00:02:05.630 
to place two buttons here two buttons
here<00:02:03.960> a<00:02:04.110> repeater<00:02:04.710> running<00:02:05.070> out<00:02:05.159> of<00:02:05.189> both<00:02:05.460> of

00:02:05.630 --> 00:02:05.640 
here a repeater running out of both of

00:02:05.640 --> 00:02:07.340 
here a repeater running out of both of
those<00:02:05.790> on<00:02:06.030> either<00:02:06.149> side<00:02:06.450> and<00:02:06.659> those<00:02:07.200> were

those on either side and those were

00:02:07.350 --> 00:02:09.020 
those on either side and those were
pizzas<00:02:07.710> are<00:02:07.920> going<00:02:08.129> to<00:02:08.190> be<00:02:08.250> running<00:02:08.459> off<00:02:08.670> into

00:02:09.020 --> 00:02:09.030 
pizzas are going to be running off into

00:02:09.030 --> 00:02:10.249 
pizzas are going to be running off into
blocks<00:02:09.270> now<00:02:09.509> these<00:02:09.690> are<00:02:09.840> going<00:02:09.959> to<00:02:10.050> be<00:02:10.140> the

00:02:10.249 --> 00:02:10.259 
blocks now these are going to be the

00:02:10.259 --> 00:02:12.290 
blocks now these are going to be the
main<00:02:10.500> inputs<00:02:11.009> where<00:02:11.459> you<00:02:11.550> press<00:02:11.819> the<00:02:11.849> button

00:02:12.290 --> 00:02:12.300 
main inputs where you press the button

00:02:12.300 --> 00:02:13.850 
main inputs where you press the button
to<00:02:12.720> get<00:02:12.900> the<00:02:13.050> arm<00:02:13.230> of<00:02:13.349> the<00:02:13.379> one

00:02:13.850 --> 00:02:13.860 
to get the arm of the one

00:02:13.860 --> 00:02:14.750 
to get the arm of the one
and<00:02:13.950> now<00:02:14.070> it's<00:02:14.160> going<00:02:14.280> to<00:02:14.340> be<00:02:14.400> heading<00:02:14.640> off

00:02:14.750 --> 00:02:14.760 
and now it's going to be heading off

00:02:14.760 --> 00:02:16.790 
and now it's going to be heading off
into<00:02:14.970> all<00:02:15.210> of<00:02:15.240> the<00:02:15.390> droppers<00:02:15.780> next<00:02:16.560> up<00:02:16.680> you

00:02:16.790 --> 00:02:16.800 
into all of the droppers next up you

00:02:16.800 --> 00:02:18.410 
into all of the droppers next up you
want<00:02:16.920> to<00:02:16.950> make<00:02:17.010> the<00:02:17.190> armor<00:02:17.550> equipping<00:02:17.970> station

00:02:18.410 --> 00:02:18.420 
want to make the armor equipping station

00:02:18.420 --> 00:02:20.510 
want to make the armor equipping station
by<00:02:18.780> placing<00:02:19.110> a<00:02:19.200> dispenser<00:02:19.770> facing<00:02:20.130> upwards

00:02:20.510 --> 00:02:20.520 
by placing a dispenser facing upwards

00:02:20.520 --> 00:02:22.940 
by placing a dispenser facing upwards
and<00:02:20.670> then<00:02:21.180> two<00:02:21.450> dispensers<00:02:22.020> facing<00:02:22.590> inwards

00:02:22.940 --> 00:02:22.950 
and then two dispensers facing inwards

00:02:22.950 --> 00:02:25.130 
and then two dispensers facing inwards
and<00:02:23.100> then<00:02:23.700> a<00:02:23.790> block<00:02:24.030> here<00:02:24.300> with<00:02:24.690> another

00:02:25.130 --> 00:02:25.140 
and then a block here with another

00:02:25.140 --> 00:02:27.380 
and then a block here with another
dispenser<00:02:25.740> facing<00:02:26.040> downwards<00:02:26.430> and<00:02:26.520> that<00:02:26.580> is

dispenser facing downwards and that is

00:02:27.390 --> 00:02:28.910 
dispenser facing downwards and that is
all<00:02:27.600> of<00:02:27.720> that<00:02:27.870> so<00:02:28.080> you<00:02:28.140> can<00:02:28.350> remove<00:02:28.650> the

00:02:28.910 --> 00:02:28.920 
all of that so you can remove the

00:02:28.920 --> 00:02:30.890 
all of that so you can remove the
temporary<00:02:29.220> blocks<00:02:29.580> and<00:02:29.850> this<00:02:30.300> is<00:02:30.480> pretty<00:02:30.690> much

00:02:30.890 --> 00:02:30.900 
temporary blocks and this is pretty much

00:02:30.900 --> 00:02:33.770 
temporary blocks and this is pretty much
the<00:02:31.110> basics<00:02:31.500> done<00:02:32.300> then<00:02:33.300> you<00:02:33.420> want<00:02:33.570> to<00:02:33.600> place

00:02:33.770 --> 00:02:33.780 
the basics done then you want to place

00:02:33.780 --> 00:02:35.480 
the basics done then you want to place
to<00:02:34.020> droppers<00:02:34.350> facing<00:02:34.680> inwards<00:02:35.040> on<00:02:35.190> either

00:02:35.480 --> 00:02:35.490 
to droppers facing inwards on either

00:02:35.490 --> 00:02:37.280 
to droppers facing inwards on either
side<00:02:35.790> like<00:02:35.940> this<00:02:36.120> this<00:02:36.480> is<00:02:36.660> going<00:02:36.900> to<00:02:36.990> be<00:02:37.110> where
