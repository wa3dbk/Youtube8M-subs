00:01:44.060 --> 00:01:44.070 
and then we're just too many plays too

00:01:44.070 --> 00:01:46.280 
and then we're just too many plays too
many<00:01:44.220> place<00:01:44.430> so<00:01:44.729> I<00:01:45.360> think<00:01:45.869> we<00:01:45.930> just<00:01:45.960> got<00:01:46.170> to

00:01:46.280 --> 00:01:46.290 
many place so I think we just got to

00:01:46.290 --> 00:01:47.630 
many place so I think we just got to
continue<00:01:46.439> to<00:01:46.649> look<00:01:46.799> at<00:01:46.920> what<00:01:47.070> what<00:01:47.340> we<00:01:47.460> did

00:01:47.630 --> 00:01:47.640 
continue to look at what what we did

00:01:47.640 --> 00:01:49.069 
continue to look at what what we did
well<00:01:47.820> what<00:01:47.970> we<00:01:48.090> didn't<00:01:48.329> do<00:01:48.390> well<00:01:48.509> and<00:01:48.689> fix<00:01:48.899> it

00:01:49.069 --> 00:01:49.079 
well what we didn't do well and fix it

00:01:49.079 --> 00:01:50.870 
well what we didn't do well and fix it
and<00:01:49.979> that's<00:01:50.159> it<00:01:50.280> it's<00:01:50.399> nothing<00:01:50.610> you<00:01:50.670> can<00:01:50.790> do

00:01:50.870 --> 00:01:50.880 
and that's it it's nothing you can do

00:01:50.880 --> 00:01:52.370 
and that's it it's nothing you can do
