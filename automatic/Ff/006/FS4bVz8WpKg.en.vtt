00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.339
 Hello everyone, with you about the new today I am you 

00:00:02.220 --> 00:00:07.339
 teach you how to draw on such a cross 

00:00:16.410 --> 00:00:22.220
 can do 

00:00:20.500 --> 00:00:23.590
 So 

00:00:22.220 --> 00:00:26.280
 can 

00:00:23.590 --> 00:00:26.280
 2 cells 

00:00:27.060 --> 00:00:29.060
 and 

00:00:29.260 --> 00:00:31.920
 and 

00:00:33.280 --> 00:00:35.969
 and so do 

00:00:38.950 --> 00:00:41.760
 Nyagan 

00:00:41.890 --> 00:00:44.890
 then 

00:00:46.329 --> 00:00:48.660
 Gleb 

00:01:04.210 --> 00:01:06.690
 the outcome 

00:01:12.320 --> 00:01:15.320
 he 

00:01:16.900 --> 00:01:31.810
 up 

00:01:18.950 --> 00:01:35.530
 sprigs of like this 

00:01:31.810 --> 00:01:35.530
 cell tour 

00:01:59.980 --> 00:02:02.280
 when 

00:02:40.270 --> 00:02:44.110
 still just 

00:02:45.770 --> 00:02:48.550
 . 

00:02:52.690 --> 00:02:56.300
 and 

00:02:53.520 --> 00:02:56.300
 way there 

00:02:58.750 --> 00:03:01.750
 not 

00:03:03.770 --> 00:03:08.640
 time you get 

00:03:06.100 --> 00:03:08.640
 who does not want 

00:03:11.540 --> 00:03:13.719
 this 

00:03:16.580 --> 00:03:18.970
 . 

00:03:36.470 --> 00:03:43.660
 This is the most beautiful part in general. 

00:03:39.860 --> 00:03:43.660
 this cross that exists 

00:03:44.980 --> 00:03:58.930
 is about to turn out 

00:03:47.150 --> 00:04:03.710
 and then you can draw such here 

00:03:58.930 --> 00:04:08.150
 if done here high does not mean and 

00:04:03.710 --> 00:04:14.630
 I only recently learned to erase and yet 

00:04:08.150 --> 00:04:17.269
 one then be sure it can be done 

00:04:14.630 --> 00:04:19.760
 make a step like creating a window and 

00:04:17.269 --> 00:04:23.900
 somehow so there and you get smoother 

00:04:19.760 --> 00:04:29.500
 and beautiful and subscribe to it 

00:04:23.900 --> 00:04:37.450
 on my channel and put your fingers top and all 

00:04:29.500 --> 00:04:37.450
 there will be more ideas you see and interest
