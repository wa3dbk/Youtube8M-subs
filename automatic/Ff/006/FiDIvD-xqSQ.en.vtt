00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.890
 please tell me how it is done 

00:00:01.560 --> 00:00:06.180
 automatic landing system which 

00:00:03.890 --> 00:00:08.970
 pilot actions which systems and 

00:00:06.180 --> 00:00:11.910
 implementing an automatic system 

00:00:08.970 --> 00:00:14.700
 sneakers automatic fit system 

00:00:11.910 --> 00:00:17.250
 it is not located on the plane 

00:00:14.700 --> 00:00:19.439
 on earth in order to but have 

00:00:17.250 --> 00:00:21.359
 certain criteria in which 

00:00:19.439 --> 00:00:22.859
 which conditions criteria conditions when 

00:00:21.359 --> 00:00:26.050
 which automatic landing is possible 

00:00:22.859 --> 00:00:28.210
 either impossible to drive 

00:00:26.050 --> 00:00:31.950
 the land is set accurately and the system call 

00:00:28.210 --> 00:00:34.940
 and pus some important about his system 

00:00:31.950 --> 00:00:37.250
 clinician adjuvant 

00:00:34.940 --> 00:00:41.780
 if the earth is installed this system 

00:00:37.250 --> 00:00:43.760
 then the plane which is equipped with the system 

00:00:41.780 --> 00:00:44.960
 auto landing can make 

00:00:43.760 --> 00:00:46.969
 automatic landing 

00:00:44.960 --> 00:00:49.610
 if there are no injuries on the airfield 

00:00:46.969 --> 00:00:52.549
 there are no technical means 

00:00:49.610 --> 00:00:55.250
 accurate landing systems then the plane is not 

00:00:52.549 --> 00:00:57.409
 perform year mass systems in what 

00:00:55.250 --> 00:00:59.400
 principle is principle at all 

00:00:57.409 --> 00:01:02.870
 performance 

00:00:59.400 --> 00:01:02.870
 optical precipitation means 

00:01:03.310 --> 00:01:09.430
 the aircraft is landing 

00:01:06.460 --> 00:01:13.000
 reason for the exact system appeared that is he 

00:01:09.430 --> 00:01:16.120
 is the glide path he has speed 

00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:18.880
 set height set then 

00:01:16.120 --> 00:01:20.860
 There is a profile according to the reduction mode 

00:01:18.880 --> 00:01:25.420
 work 2 drops set and so he 

00:01:20.860 --> 00:01:28.930
 performs a call on the radio beam appeared 

00:01:25.420 --> 00:01:30.580
 Said that appeared to fulfill passed on 

00:01:28.930 --> 00:01:33.720
 reaching a certain height you need 

00:01:30.580 --> 00:01:35.460
 different planes of different heights 

00:01:33.720 --> 00:01:39.110
 radio altimeter enters work 

00:01:35.460 --> 00:01:41.000
 which are using and 

00:01:39.110 --> 00:01:43.850
 for the sake of the altimeter which is based 

00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:44.630
 Doppler radiation ie radius 

00:01:43.850 --> 00:01:47.000
 will be apiaries 

00:01:44.630 --> 00:01:49.260
 sends a signal to earth 

00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:52.620
 reflected is accepted by the receiver 

00:01:49.260 --> 00:01:55.380
 so i.e. current height 1 

00:01:52.620 --> 00:01:57.840
 truly becomes a plane car itself 

00:01:55.380 --> 00:01:59.490
 the machine itself i.e. aircraft automation 

00:01:57.840 --> 00:02:01.980
 the computer starts to count this one 

00:01:59.490 --> 00:02:04.440
 the landing profile and us leads it 

00:02:01.980 --> 00:02:07.290
 Accurately caught and remember Sarah exactly 

00:02:04.440 --> 00:02:08.640
 there is like a decrease in aircraft when 

00:02:07.290 --> 00:02:12.440
 approach to certain high 

00:02:08.640 --> 00:02:12.440
 alignment systems are connected and 

00:02:12.510 --> 00:02:17.129
 and the mode of operation you have them ie the plane 

00:02:14.700 --> 00:02:19.680
 want at a height let's say 50 feet and 

00:02:17.129 --> 00:02:22.290
 roughly say about laying on 315 meters 

00:02:19.680 --> 00:02:24.180
 the plane is leveled that is 

00:02:22.290 --> 00:02:26.670
 shifted stabilizer to a height and 

00:02:24.180 --> 00:02:28.829
 upwards and is selected operation mode 2 where 

00:02:26.670 --> 00:02:30.900
 that is, a landing position is created 

00:02:28.829 --> 00:02:32.670
 all further when there is no thrust 

00:02:30.900 --> 00:02:34.920
 aircraft engines to the landing strip 

00:02:32.670 --> 00:02:37.579
 just sits down 

00:02:34.920 --> 00:02:39.780
 the system itself still exists 

00:02:37.579 --> 00:02:42.000
 automatic follow the so -called 

00:02:39.780 --> 00:02:44.700
 mileage lane but it's the same thing yes you 

00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:46.440
 keeps on st himself better he stands 

00:02:44.700 --> 00:02:48.690
 not at the beginning we get at the end to stand 

00:02:46.440 --> 00:02:50.340
 let it be and maintaining this track 

00:02:48.690 --> 00:02:51.290
 get this signal the plane withstand 

00:02:50.340 --> 00:02:53.620
 direction 

00:02:51.290 --> 00:02:56.680
 along the strip 

00:02:53.620 --> 00:02:59.640
 that's the principle of entering the machine what is 

00:02:56.680 --> 00:02:59.640
 automatically posad 

00:02:59.690 --> 00:03:03.560
 Further 

00:03:00.740 --> 00:03:05.410
 soft landing she put it bluntly 

00:03:03.560 --> 00:03:06.700
 calibrated by equipment 

00:03:05.410 --> 00:03:09.100
 and is on its very meaning 

00:03:06.700 --> 00:03:11.100
 set up that way and with that 

00:03:09.100 --> 00:03:13.090
 the calculation is that the plane is leveled 

00:03:11.100 --> 00:03:15.520
 aligns starts alignment 

00:03:13.090 --> 00:03:18.130
 automatically taking into account many parameters 

00:03:15.520 --> 00:03:20.230
 the same as an agonizing wind 2 

00:03:18.130 --> 00:03:21.260
 aircraft until until you see takes into account 

00:03:20.230 --> 00:03:22.849
 it all teaches 

00:03:21.260 --> 00:03:25.780
 well this is cheating computer which 

00:03:22.849 --> 00:03:28.450
 gets current flight parameters 

00:03:25.780 --> 00:03:30.880
 outside on the pitot tube exists too 

00:03:28.450 --> 00:03:32.020
 radio altimeter exists but exists 

00:03:30.880 --> 00:03:34.570
 there 

00:03:32.020 --> 00:03:36.250
 nose and nose meter 

00:03:34.570 --> 00:03:37.960
 rustic meaning accuracy 

00:03:36.250 --> 00:03:39.760
 positioning is all free 

00:03:37.960 --> 00:03:40.520
 the computer processes them gives always in 

00:03:39.760 --> 00:03:41.690
 one 

00:03:40.520 --> 00:03:43.960
 in principle, this is an automatic principle 

00:03:41.690 --> 00:03:45.820
 landing does not need truth 

00:03:43.960 --> 00:03:47.710
 unless the aerodrome is equipped precisely 

00:03:45.820 --> 00:03:50.000
 approach system then the plane and 

00:03:47.710 --> 00:03:53.770
 can perform 

00:03:50.000 --> 00:03:53.770
 if he has any problems 

00:03:54.190 --> 00:03:59.230
 that is, practically a pilot he can 

00:03:57.220 --> 00:04:01.450
 eat the first part and the pilot and 

00:03:59.230 --> 00:04:02.980
 you can sit down without you 

00:04:01.450 --> 00:04:06.040
 just not but it is necessary to understand that 

00:04:02.980 --> 00:04:07.720
 for all the same set of certain 

00:04:06.040 --> 00:04:09.730
 action and go in the machine you 

00:04:07.720 --> 00:04:12.340
 perform when the plane will not be you 

00:04:09.730 --> 00:04:14.050
 releasing the flaps of the highway and then he doesn't 

00:04:12.340 --> 00:04:18.250
 will do that is and in a certain 

00:04:14.050 --> 00:04:20.500
 the place is also so airplane specific 

00:04:18.250 --> 00:04:21.870
 what should I do next when 

00:04:20.500 --> 00:04:24.080
 approach to execution 

00:04:21.870 --> 00:04:26.840
 automatic auto walks in 

00:04:24.080 --> 00:04:29.760
 the plane is dropping leave mode 

00:04:26.840 --> 00:04:31.320
 coming to a certain removal line 

00:04:29.760 --> 00:04:33.510
 from the airfield languished you donate 

00:04:31.320 --> 00:04:36.210
 if you release the mechanization of the plane 

00:04:33.510 --> 00:04:38.460
 further reduce the speed further release 

00:04:36.210 --> 00:04:39.570
 following there is an intermediate position 

00:04:38.460 --> 00:04:41.910
 flaps 

00:04:39.570 --> 00:04:43.770
 next you have to press the right button 

00:04:41.910 --> 00:04:45.070
 call let the plane get 

00:04:43.770 --> 00:04:47.380
 waiting for the team 

00:04:45.070 --> 00:04:49.000
 i have to click 

00:04:47.380 --> 00:04:51.310
 that is, he must capture those class 

00:04:49.000 --> 00:04:53.350
 was a block yes and had to grab and 

00:04:51.310 --> 00:04:54.610
 a sturdy garden 

00:04:53.350 --> 00:04:56.920
 you will release the chassis 

00:04:54.610 --> 00:04:58.450
 release flaps shape like 

00:04:56.920 --> 00:05:00.460
 break, that is, it's all done 

00:04:58.450 --> 00:05:01.849
 team at the helm do not need to touch 

00:05:00.460 --> 00:05:04.419
 accounting 

00:05:01.849 --> 00:05:04.419
 passat
