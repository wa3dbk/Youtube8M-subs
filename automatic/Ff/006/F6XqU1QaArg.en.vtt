00:00:46.180 --> 00:00:50.350
 adventure action video game of style 

00:00:48.399 --> 00:00:53.409

00:01:09.940 --> 00:01:13.780
 people controlled through a 

00:01:12.220 --> 00:01:16.090
 parasite 

00:01:13.780 --> 00:01:19.210
 now let's move to position 2 where 

00:01:16.090 --> 00:01:21.220
 find your ar 4 is a video game of 

00:01:19.210 --> 00:01:23.110
 first person tactical shots 

00:01:21.220 --> 00:01:25.360
 developed by irrational games and 

00:01:23.110 --> 00:01:28.659
 posted by vivendi universal games the 

00:01:25.360 --> 00:01:30.880
 April 5, 2005 the game is 

00:01:28.659 --> 00:01:33.310
 focused on a swat team led 

00:01:30.880 --> 00:01:35.920
 by the player who takes part in the 

00:01:33.310 --> 00:01:38.080
 resolution of different objectives such 

00:01:35.920 --> 00:01:41.020
 as release of hostages or detention 

00:01:38.080 --> 00:01:43.000
 of dangerous subjects its playability is 

00:01:41.020 --> 00:01:46.000
 good and the graphics are very good 

00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:48.670
 achieved this I also recommend them 

00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:50.830
 with this we went to position number 1 

00:01:48.670 --> 00:01:53.289
 where is the big game matrix 

00:01:50.830 --> 00:01:55.539
 pair tournament is a video game of shots 

00:01:53.289 --> 00:01:57.840
 in the third person and the third 

00:01:55.539 --> 00:02:01.060
 video game based on the matrix trilogy 

00:01:57.840 --> 00:02:03.280
 the players control the meo character 

00:02:01.060 --> 00:02:05.909
 in levels based on the scenes of the 

00:02:03.280 --> 00:02:08.259
 movies the game allows the player 

00:02:05.909 --> 00:02:11.140
 participate in several action scenes 

00:02:08.259 --> 00:02:13.239
 in the movies most of these 

00:02:11.140 --> 00:02:16.000
 sequences are taken from the first 

00:02:13.239 --> 00:02:17.950
 movie of the series this game is very 

00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:20.150
 good and works very well on the netbook 

00:02:17.950 --> 00:02:23.329
 but first we must do some 

00:02:20.150 --> 00:02:25.459
 to play it before finishing them 

00:02:23.329 --> 00:02:27.799
 I want to say that I will leave the games 

00:02:25.459 --> 00:02:31.340
 in the description of the video plus the 

00:02:27.799 --> 00:02:33.739
 steps I also wanted to tell you that I had 

00:02:31.340 --> 00:02:36.439
 to do a top 4 because many games 

00:02:33.739 --> 00:02:39.069
 download them and try to install them but 

00:02:36.439 --> 00:02:42.040
 they did not work between them this must be 

00:02:39.069 --> 00:02:44.989
 the riddick chronicles and a couple more 

00:02:42.040 --> 00:02:47.689
 to know what other games work 

00:02:44.989 --> 00:02:50.060
 look at my previous videos and if you have 

00:02:47.689 --> 00:02:52.940
 some other game that worked for you leave it 

00:02:50.060 --> 00:02:56.239
 in the comments so I can do another 

00:02:52.940 --> 00:03:00.700
 top with more games now I can 

00:02:56.239 --> 00:03:00.700
 dismiss subscribe goodbye
