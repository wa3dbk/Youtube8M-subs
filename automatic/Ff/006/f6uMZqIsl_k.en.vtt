show<00:01:48.200> you<00:01:48.260> to<00:01:48.920> apply<00:01:49.220> this<00:01:49.280> on<00:01:49.730> the

00:01:50.680 --> 00:01:50.690 
show you to apply this on the

00:01:53.170 --> 00:01:53.180 
instruction of manual but if you don't

00:01:53.180 --> 00:01:55.270 
instruction of manual but if you don't
have<00:01:53.390> that<00:01:53.600> your<00:01:54.380> bike<00:01:54.650> will<00:01:54.920> just<00:01:55.130> keep

have that your bike will just keep
falling<00:01:55.790> over<00:01:56.090> so<00:01:56.120> you<00:01:56.360> will<00:01:56.720> have<00:01:56.900> one<00:01:57.140> of

00:01:57.250 --> 00:01:57.260 
falling over so you will have one of

00:01:57.260 --> 00:01:59.590 
falling over so you will have one of
these<00:01:57.350> left<00:01:57.710> over<00:01:58.040> in<00:01:58.190> your<00:01:58.220> set<00:01:58.640> I<00:01:58.880> can<00:01:59.270> pretty

00:02:01.870 --> 00:02:01.880 
much guarantee that will be a spare

00:02:01.880 --> 00:02:03.850 
much guarantee that will be a spare
piece<00:02:02.180> so<00:02:02.750> all<00:02:02.900> you<00:02:02.990> need<00:02:03.110> to<00:02:03.230> do<00:02:03.350> is<00:02:03.440> clip<00:02:03.680> that

00:02:03.850 --> 00:02:03.860 
piece so all you need to do is clip that

00:02:03.860 --> 00:02:05.950 
piece so all you need to do is clip that
