hi it's Kathy Adams cleric and today
we're<00:00:10.930> going<00:00:11.110> to<00:00:11.290> process<00:00:11.559> multiple<00:00:12.190> raw

00:00:12.810 --> 00:00:12.820 
we're going to process multiple raw

00:00:12.820 --> 00:00:14.820 
we're going to process multiple raw
photographs<00:00:13.510> that<00:00:13.660> were<00:00:13.809> taken<00:00:13.840> with<00:00:14.320> a<00:00:14.350> rapid

00:00:14.820 --> 00:00:14.830 
photographs that were taken with a rapid

00:00:14.830 --> 00:00:18.000 
photographs that were taken with a rapid
burst<00:00:15.100> I<00:00:15.520> like<00:00:16.150> them<00:00:16.360> all<00:00:16.600> double<00:00:17.140> click<00:00:17.470> and

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:18.010 
burst I like them all double click and

00:00:18.010 --> 00:00:20.100 
burst I like them all double click and
when<00:00:18.340> you<00:00:18.460> do<00:00:18.610> that<00:00:18.820> they<00:00:19.060> open<00:00:19.390> all<00:00:19.660> into

00:00:20.100 --> 00:00:20.110 
when you do that they open all into

00:00:20.110 --> 00:00:22.980 
when you do that they open all into
Camera<00:00:20.590> Raw<00:00:20.860> and<00:00:21.250> bringing<00:00:22.150> them<00:00:22.300> into<00:00:22.420> Camera

00:00:22.980 --> 00:00:22.990 
Camera Raw and bringing them into Camera

00:00:22.990 --> 00:00:25.590 
Camera Raw and bringing them into Camera
Raw<00:00:23.199> we're<00:00:23.530> going<00:00:23.830> to<00:00:24.040> select<00:00:24.640> all<00:00:24.880> because

00:00:25.590 --> 00:00:25.600 
Raw we're going to select all because

00:00:25.600 --> 00:00:27.560 
Raw we're going to select all because
all<00:00:25.840> of<00:00:25.900> them<00:00:26.200> look<00:00:26.440> virtually<00:00:27.040> the<00:00:27.520> same

00:00:27.560 --> 00:00:27.570 
all of them look virtually the same

00:00:27.570 --> 00:00:30.420 
all of them look virtually the same
we're<00:00:28.570> going<00:00:28.840> to<00:00:28.990> clarify<00:00:29.410> we're<00:00:30.130> going<00:00:30.340> to

00:00:30.420 --> 00:00:30.430 
we're going to clarify we're going to

00:00:30.430 --> 00:00:33.119 
we're going to clarify we're going to
vibrance<00:00:30.970> and<00:00:31.240> we're<00:00:31.510> going<00:00:31.750> to<00:00:31.870> saturate<00:00:32.649> and

00:00:33.119 --> 00:00:33.129 
vibrance and we're going to saturate and

00:00:33.129 --> 00:00:36.240 
vibrance and we're going to saturate and
that<00:00:33.910> will<00:00:34.180> take<00:00:34.420> care<00:00:34.780> of<00:00:35.110> doing<00:00:35.500> that<00:00:35.860> for

00:00:36.240 --> 00:00:36.250 
that will take care of doing that for

00:00:36.250 --> 00:00:37.979 
that will take care of doing that for
all<00:00:36.370> of<00:00:36.399> the<00:00:36.550> photographs<00:00:37.180> but<00:00:37.480> you<00:00:37.660> notice

00:00:37.979 --> 00:00:37.989 
all of the photographs but you notice

00:00:37.989 --> 00:00:39.960 
all of the photographs but you notice
that<00:00:38.170> we've<00:00:38.320> got<00:00:38.350> that<00:00:38.710> little<00:00:38.739> shade<00:00:39.280> of<00:00:39.579> blue

00:00:39.960 --> 00:00:39.970 
that we've got that little shade of blue

00:00:39.970 --> 00:00:42.480 
that we've got that little shade of blue
that<00:00:40.000> means<00:00:40.480> the<00:00:40.780> black<00:00:41.079> is<00:00:41.350> overpowering<00:00:42.130> so

00:00:42.480 --> 00:00:42.490 
that means the black is overpowering so

00:00:42.490 --> 00:00:43.800 
that means the black is overpowering so
we're<00:00:42.610> going<00:00:42.700> to<00:00:42.790> move<00:00:42.940> our<00:00:43.120> black<00:00:43.360> slider

00:00:43.800 --> 00:00:43.810 
we're going to move our black slider

00:00:43.810 --> 00:00:46.290 
we're going to move our black slider
look<00:00:44.650> at<00:00:44.770> that<00:00:44.920> histogram<00:00:45.310> that<00:00:45.579> histogram

00:00:46.290 --> 00:00:46.300 
look at that histogram that histogram

00:00:46.300 --> 00:00:48.660 
look at that histogram that histogram
needs<00:00:46.840> to<00:00:47.110> be<00:00:47.230> moved<00:00:47.500> over<00:00:47.800> and<00:00:48.190> that's<00:00:48.340> then

00:00:48.660 --> 00:00:48.670 
needs to be moved over and that's then

00:00:48.670 --> 00:00:52.530 
needs to be moved over and that's then
the<00:00:48.970> exposure<00:00:49.510> slider<00:00:50.010> not<00:00:51.010> too<00:00:51.280> far<00:00:51.610> you<00:00:52.420> have

00:00:52.530 --> 00:00:52.540 
the exposure slider not too far you have

00:00:52.540 --> 00:00:54.300 
the exposure slider not too far you have
to<00:00:52.690> watch<00:00:52.930> to<00:00:53.380> make<00:00:53.560> sure<00:00:53.620> that<00:00:54.070> we're<00:00:54.280> not

00:00:54.300 --> 00:00:54.310 
to watch to make sure that we're not

00:00:54.310 --> 00:00:56.940 
to watch to make sure that we're not
blowing<00:00:54.730> out<00:00:55.120> the<00:00:55.270> highlights<00:00:55.480> and<00:00:56.320> so<00:00:56.770> just

00:00:56.940 --> 00:00:56.950 
blowing out the highlights and so just

00:00:56.950 --> 00:00:59.639 
blowing out the highlights and so just
move<00:00:57.280> that<00:00:57.550> back<00:00:57.850> just<00:00:58.480> tell<00:00:58.750> the<00:00:58.930> corner<00:00:59.410> of

00:00:59.639 --> 00:00:59.649 
move that back just tell the corner of

00:00:59.649 --> 00:01:02.910 
move that back just tell the corner of
the<00:00:59.829> histogram<00:01:00.250> hits<00:01:01.239> the<00:01:01.570> corner<00:01:02.110> of<00:01:02.290> that

00:01:02.910 --> 00:01:02.920 
the histogram hits the corner of that

00:01:02.920 --> 00:01:07.469 
the histogram hits the corner of that
graph<00:01:03.280> right<00:01:03.850> about<00:01:04.119> there<00:01:06.299> now<00:01:07.299> you'll

00:01:07.469 --> 00:01:07.479 
graph right about there now you'll

00:01:07.479 --> 00:01:09.420 
graph right about there now you'll
notice<00:01:07.719> that<00:01:07.899> in<00:01:08.229> each<00:01:08.380> one<00:01:08.710> of<00:01:08.890> these<00:01:09.009> images

00:01:09.420 --> 00:01:09.430 
notice that in each one of these images

00:01:09.430 --> 00:01:11.670 
notice that in each one of these images
they're<00:01:10.210> virtually<00:01:10.719> the<00:01:10.869> same<00:01:10.899> they're

00:01:11.670 --> 00:01:11.680 
they're virtually the same they're

00:01:11.680 --> 00:01:14.160 
they're virtually the same they're
Ygritte<00:01:12.159> is<00:01:12.310> just<00:01:12.549> moving<00:01:12.790> but<00:01:13.540> in<00:01:13.690> each<00:01:13.870> one

00:01:14.160 --> 00:01:14.170 
Ygritte is just moving but in each one

00:01:14.170 --> 00:01:17.340 
Ygritte is just moving but in each one
of<00:01:14.350> the<00:01:14.470> images<00:01:15.100> the<00:01:15.850> main<00:01:16.180> area<00:01:16.900> that<00:01:17.200> we're

00:01:17.340 --> 00:01:17.350 
of the images the main area that we're

00:01:17.350 --> 00:01:19.469 
of the images the main area that we're
going<00:01:17.560> to<00:01:17.650> concentrate<00:01:17.890> on<00:01:18.340> is<00:01:18.520> this<00:01:19.060> tail

00:01:19.469 --> 00:01:19.479 
going to concentrate on is this tail

00:01:19.479 --> 00:01:22.110 
going to concentrate on is this tail
flare<00:01:19.960> right<00:01:20.290> here<00:01:20.860> and<00:01:21.070> so<00:01:21.670> we're<00:01:21.909> going<00:01:22.060> to

00:01:22.110 --> 00:01:22.120 
flare right here and so we're going to

00:01:22.120 --> 00:01:25.140 
flare right here and so we're going to
I'm<00:01:22.330> going<00:01:22.540> to<00:01:22.600> go<00:01:22.750> in<00:01:22.990> open<00:01:23.740> all<00:01:24.310> the<00:01:24.640> images

00:01:25.140 --> 00:01:25.150 
I'm going to go in open all the images

00:01:25.150 --> 00:01:27.429 
I'm going to go in open all the images
to<00:01:25.600> a<00:01:25.630> hundred<00:01:25.990> percent

00:01:27.429 --> 00:01:27.439 
to a hundred percent

00:01:27.439 --> 00:01:29.469 
to a hundred percent
and<00:01:27.530> when<00:01:28.130> I<00:01:28.159> go<00:01:28.520> to<00:01:28.549> a<00:01:28.820> hundred<00:01:29.149> percent

00:01:29.469 --> 00:01:29.479 
and when I go to a hundred percent

00:01:29.479 --> 00:01:32.649 
and when I go to a hundred percent
that's<00:01:30.200> going<00:01:30.649> to<00:01:30.770> magnify<00:01:31.399> all<00:01:32.270> of<00:01:32.539> the

00:01:32.649 --> 00:01:32.659 
that's going to magnify all of the

00:01:32.659 --> 00:01:34.599 
that's going to magnify all of the
images<00:01:33.020> to<00:01:33.170> a<00:01:33.200> hundred<00:01:33.499> percent<00:01:33.649> click<00:01:34.310> on<00:01:34.490> the

00:01:41.980 --> 00:01:41.990 
there and then now each one of the

00:01:41.990 --> 00:01:45.609 
there and then now each one of the
images<00:01:42.469> when<00:01:42.649> I<00:01:42.679> open<00:01:43.249> them<00:01:43.369> up<00:01:43.549> are<00:01:43.939> going<00:01:44.780> to

00:01:45.609 --> 00:01:45.619 
images when I open them up are going to

00:01:45.619 --> 00:01:48.819 
images when I open them up are going to
go<00:01:46.429> straight<00:01:46.939> to<00:01:47.149> that<00:01:47.179> tail<00:01:47.599> flare<00:01:47.990> area<00:01:48.530> and

00:01:48.819 --> 00:01:48.829 
go straight to that tail flare area and

00:01:48.829 --> 00:01:51.490 
go straight to that tail flare area and
that's<00:01:49.130> going<00:01:49.429> to<00:01:49.520> make<00:01:49.759> it<00:01:49.939> a<00:01:49.969> lot<00:01:50.359> easier<00:01:50.869> to

00:01:51.490 --> 00:01:51.500 
that's going to make it a lot easier to

00:01:51.500 --> 00:01:54.370 
that's going to make it a lot easier to
process<00:01:51.799> them<00:01:52.369> I<00:01:52.609> like<00:01:53.450> the<00:01:53.659> detail<00:01:54.079> in<00:01:54.259> this

00:01:54.370 --> 00:01:54.380 
process them I like the detail in this

00:01:54.380 --> 00:01:56.699 
process them I like the detail in this
photo<00:01:54.679> so<00:01:54.950> I'm<00:01:55.039> going<00:01:55.189> to<00:01:55.280> give<00:01:55.399> it<00:01:55.520> two<00:01:55.789> stars

I'm<00:02:03.379> just<00:02:03.590> moving<00:02:03.799> the<00:02:04.159> picture<00:02:04.520> around<00:02:04.640> with

00:02:04.869 --> 00:02:04.879 
I'm just moving the picture around with

00:02:04.879 --> 00:02:07.749 
I'm just moving the picture around with
the<00:02:05.030> hand<00:02:05.270> tool<00:02:05.719> that's<00:02:06.439> a<00:02:06.619> three<00:02:06.920> start<00:02:07.369> go<00:02:07.729> to
