00:00:41.570 --> 00:00:41.580 
engine it's a straight eight built by

00:00:41.580 --> 00:00:45.160 
engine it's a straight eight built by
Lycoming<00:00:42.330> and<00:00:43.010> they<00:00:44.010> actually<00:00:44.190> just<00:00:44.580> took<00:00:44.820> and

00:00:45.160 --> 00:00:45.170 
Lycoming and they actually just took and

00:00:45.170 --> 00:00:48.140 
Lycoming and they actually just took and
bolted<00:00:46.170> the<00:00:46.350> engine<00:00:47.100> and<00:00:47.220> transmission<00:00:47.520> to<00:00:48.120> a

00:00:48.140 --> 00:00:48.150 
bolted the engine and transmission to a

00:00:48.150 --> 00:00:50.450 
bolted the engine and transmission to a
differential<00:00:48.930> and<00:00:49.410> just<00:00:49.860> turn<00:00:50.070> to<00:00:50.220> ground

00:00:50.450 --> 00:00:50.460 
differential and just turn to ground

00:00:50.460 --> 00:00:53.990 
differential and just turn to ground
mounted<00:00:50.850> that<00:00:50.970> backwards<00:00:51.540> in<00:00:52.290> the<00:00:52.500> car<00:00:52.770> and<00:00:53.160> so

00:00:53.990 --> 00:00:54.000 
mounted that backwards in the car and so

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:56.030 
mounted that backwards in the car and so
you<00:00:54.090> have<00:00:54.420> some<00:00:55.200> of<00:00:55.260> the<00:00:55.410> things<00:00:55.470> like<00:00:55.740> the

00:00:56.030 --> 00:00:56.040 
you have some of the things like the

00:00:56.040 --> 00:00:58.850 
you have some of the things like the
linkage<00:00:56.430> up<00:00:56.670> here<00:00:57.060> that<00:00:57.900> runs<00:00:58.170> up<00:00:58.470> to<00:00:58.530> the

00:00:58.850 --> 00:00:58.860 
linkage up here that runs up to the

00:00:58.860 --> 00:01:02.240 
linkage up here that runs up to the
transmission<00:00:59.430> for<00:00:59.820> shifting<00:01:00.270> yeah<00:01:01.140> makes<00:01:02.100> it

00:01:02.240 --> 00:01:02.250 
transmission for shifting yeah makes it

00:01:02.250 --> 00:01:05.359 
transmission for shifting yeah makes it
a<00:01:02.310> little<00:01:02.520> bit<00:01:02.760> different<00:01:03.379> but<00:01:04.379> great<00:01:05.040> driving

00:01:05.359 --> 00:01:05.369 
a little bit different but great driving

00:01:05.369 --> 00:01:08.840 
a little bit different but great driving
car<00:01:05.750> in<00:01:06.750> this<00:01:06.869> car<00:01:07.170> hopefully<00:01:08.100> we'll<00:01:08.609> be<00:01:08.759> able

00:01:08.840 --> 00:01:08.850 
car in this car hopefully we'll be able

00:01:08.850 --> 00:01:11.450 
car in this car hopefully we'll be able
to<00:01:08.999> turn<00:01:09.390> the<00:01:09.570> speedometer<00:01:10.140> to<00:01:10.289> 14,000<00:01:11.280> miles

00:01:11.450 --> 00:01:11.460 
to turn the speedometer to 14,000 miles

00:01:11.460 --> 00:01:14.569 
to turn the speedometer to 14,000 miles
before<00:01:12.240> we<00:01:12.600> put<00:01:12.840> it<00:01:12.929> away<00:01:13.020> for<00:01:13.140> the<00:01:13.380> summer<00:01:13.799> so

00:01:14.569 --> 00:01:14.579 
before we put it away for the summer so

00:01:14.579 --> 00:01:18.529 
before we put it away for the summer so
it's<00:01:15.329> about<00:01:15.780> 70<00:01:16.499> miles<00:01:16.710> shy<00:01:17.130> of<00:01:17.390> 14,000<00:01:18.390> miles

00:01:18.529 --> 00:01:18.539 
it's about 70 miles shy of 14,000 miles

00:01:18.539 --> 00:01:21.230 
it's about 70 miles shy of 14,000 miles
right<00:01:18.840> now<00:01:19.280> so<00:01:20.280> anyway<00:01:20.520> it's<00:01:20.789> a<00:01:20.880> rumble<00:01:21.210> seat
