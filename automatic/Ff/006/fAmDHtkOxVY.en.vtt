00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.799
 The home is yes, the video of today is well. 

00:00:02.100 --> 00:00:07.350
 different calls expectation of these 

00:00:04.799 --> 00:00:09.900
 reality doing nails at home we 

00:00:07.350 --> 00:00:12.300
 that it is not easy to have what the 

00:00:09.900 --> 00:00:14.519
 We wait for our expectation that 

00:00:12.300 --> 00:00:16.379
 Is that beautiful thing wonderful and 

00:00:14.519 --> 00:00:19.770
 has the reality that is what really 

00:00:16.379 --> 00:00:21.990
 Come on, I'll tell you mine. 

00:00:19.770 --> 00:00:24.840
 It's closer to reality, people. 

00:00:21.990 --> 00:00:27.000
 kakÃ¡ hurt and then have to take everything and 

00:00:24.840 --> 00:00:28.859
 doing it again and taking out dust was 

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:30.750
 madness but so expectation 

00:00:28.859 --> 00:00:33.030
 expectation, we always expect that 

00:00:30.750 --> 00:00:34.920
 It's that beautiful, wonderful thing. 

00:00:33.030 --> 00:00:38.360
 that I did not make this video then 

00:00:34.920 --> 00:00:40.379
 you guys I had so much fun because 

00:00:38.360 --> 00:00:43.350
 was difficult to make from the 

00:00:40.379 --> 00:00:45.450
 leu expectation below reality 

00:00:43.350 --> 00:00:47.430
 so it's super cool, I 

00:00:45.450 --> 00:00:50.539
 I want to know which one you fill, I left. 

00:00:47.430 --> 00:00:53.460
 here below and I hope you enjoy 

00:00:50.539 --> 00:00:54.180
 the expectation already begins in the choice of 

00:00:53.460 --> 00:00:55.710
 enamel 

00:00:54.180 --> 00:00:59.129
 What we most want is that everyone 

00:00:55.710 --> 00:01:01.440
 organized by color or by brand 

00:00:59.129 --> 00:01:02.609
 the mayor and also that the choice is 

00:01:01.440 --> 00:01:05.309
 fast 

00:01:02.609 --> 00:01:08.820
 only it is not the reality is that the greater 

00:01:05.309 --> 00:01:11.970
 mess all mixed is remover with 

00:01:08.820 --> 00:01:13.710
 enamel with base and you also do not even know 

00:01:11.970 --> 00:01:15.180
 that any move to the final with this 

00:01:13.710 --> 00:01:17.640
 mess gets hard to choose 

00:01:15.180 --> 00:01:19.470
 So you're about 15 

00:01:17.640 --> 00:01:21.840
 only to choose an enamel that 

00:01:19.470 --> 00:01:23.549
 It's going to happen in my case, there's this maltino. 

00:01:21.840 --> 00:01:26.640
 Bathroom has enamel in drawer has 

00:01:23.549 --> 00:01:29.310
 enamel up in the bag - a place they 

00:01:26.640 --> 00:01:31.920
 have to be so it gets bigger mess 

00:01:29.310 --> 00:01:33.840
 At first I separated by color. 

00:01:31.920 --> 00:01:35.340
 Only what I'm going to wear, I'll wear when 

00:01:33.840 --> 00:01:36.240
 I'll veto the whole game is everything 

00:01:35.340 --> 00:01:37.740
 mixed 

00:01:36.240 --> 00:01:39.900
 and when do you finally think 

00:01:37.740 --> 00:01:43.799
 chose the perfect color enamel 

00:01:39.900 --> 00:01:45.689
 perfect, you think a little bit more 

00:01:43.799 --> 00:01:46.290
 I decided it is not the nail polish that you 

00:01:45.689 --> 00:01:49.159
 wants to pass 

00:01:46.290 --> 00:01:51.659
 then you will look for other colors of 

00:01:49.159 --> 00:01:52.680
 Enamel chosen now is time to paint 

00:01:51.659 --> 00:01:54.659
 the nails 

00:01:52.680 --> 00:01:57.149
 the expectation is that you have a place 

00:01:54.659 --> 00:01:59.490
 appropriate for this to keep you 

00:01:57.149 --> 00:02:01.799
 a straight posture so as not to hurt your back 

00:01:59.490 --> 00:02:04.170
 everything is organized everything 

00:02:01.799 --> 00:02:08.630
 tidy and only what you will need 

00:02:04.170 --> 00:02:08.630
 So you start to pass the base 

00:02:09.190 --> 00:02:13.160
 All right then 

00:02:10.670 --> 00:02:15.950
 Let's go to reality, people I do in 

00:02:13.160 --> 00:02:18.830
 up the bed game all in bed 

00:02:15.950 --> 00:02:21.470
 I have back pain because the posture 

00:02:18.830 --> 00:02:23.989
 does not contribute much at all is that way 

00:02:21.470 --> 00:02:26.780
 same place and does not have an appropriate place 

00:02:23.989 --> 00:02:30.580
 Nothing to do, you support the enamel. 

00:02:26.780 --> 00:02:30.580
 on the knee and goes right there 

00:02:32.510 --> 00:02:34.879
 it's time to pass the enamel 

00:02:34.010 --> 00:02:37.549
 chosen 

00:02:34.879 --> 00:02:40.340
 The expectation is that you say everything. 

00:02:37.549 --> 00:02:42.769
 cute, all right, that you can 

00:02:40.340 --> 00:02:45.769
 get the right amount of enamel on the 

00:02:42.769 --> 00:02:48.530
 brush and you pass without blurs both 

00:02:45.769 --> 00:02:50.000
 Of course you have patience and 

00:02:48.530 --> 00:02:56.360
 wait a little while to dry 

00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:57.230
 pass to the second layer but it is nothing 

00:02:56.360 --> 00:02:58.549
 of this 

00:02:57.230 --> 00:03:00.920
 You can not get the amount 

00:02:58.549 --> 00:03:03.019
 sure you do not have as much 

00:03:00.920 --> 00:03:05.870
 intimacy to be able to hold 

00:03:03.019 --> 00:03:07.819
 Straight and pass right away cute. 

00:03:05.870 --> 00:03:10.370
 ends up getting more glaze than it is 

00:03:07.819 --> 00:03:13.359
 necessary and there begins to be Cinderella 

00:03:10.370 --> 00:03:13.359
 get your mouth all 

00:03:20.590 --> 00:03:26.120
 ready the first layer ok now let's 

00:03:23.450 --> 00:03:28.760
 for the second layer and the expectation is 

00:03:26.120 --> 00:03:30.799
 that you also pass everything right everything 

00:03:28.760 --> 00:03:33.200
 cute and it's time to spend 

00:03:30.799 --> 00:03:34.790
 toothpick to remove excess enamel 

00:03:33.200 --> 00:03:37.549
 in the corner of the nails 

00:03:34.790 --> 00:03:39.530
 you pass very quickly and the toothpick 

00:03:37.549 --> 00:03:42.200
 that the toothpick does not screw and everything goes 

00:03:39.530 --> 00:03:44.480
 Right cutie, of course, you have one. 

00:03:42.200 --> 00:03:49.790
 little paper on the side to clean everything 

00:03:44.480 --> 00:03:51.769
 right good and reality the reality is 

00:03:49.790 --> 00:03:53.780
 that you did not have the patience to wait 

00:03:51.769 --> 00:03:56.030
 first coat dry enough to 

00:03:53.780 --> 00:03:57.349
 pass to the second and then there is also the 

00:03:56.030 --> 00:03:59.180
 bar a little more 

00:03:57.349 --> 00:04:02.180
 and another thing is the time to pass the 

00:03:59.180 --> 00:04:05.209
 palito gente has no position as soon as 

00:04:02.180 --> 00:04:07.189
 the super room knows if it will come from a 

00:04:05.209 --> 00:04:08.870
 side you see that it will not work there 

00:04:07.189 --> 00:04:11.120
 you turn from the other, you realize that 

00:04:08.870 --> 00:04:14.269
 not comfortable and then you do not 

00:04:11.120 --> 00:04:16.370
 can have that delicacy of passing 

00:04:14.269 --> 00:04:17.599
 the toothpick in the corner of the nails and what 

00:04:16.370 --> 00:04:20.030
 happens 

00:04:17.599 --> 00:04:22.970
 You go there and pa crosses nails with 

00:04:20.030 --> 00:04:27.380
 stick and he makes a risk from root to tail 

00:04:22.970 --> 00:04:30.310
 on your fingernail but okay we'll have 

00:04:27.380 --> 00:04:32.690
 patience and try to repair the enamel 

00:04:30.310 --> 00:04:36.550
 You'll know, we'll try to go through 

00:04:32.690 --> 00:04:36.550
 Up, maybe even that works out right? 

00:04:37.820 --> 00:04:43.770
 and of course the excess enamel that 

00:04:40.740 --> 00:04:46.350
 there on the toothpick you know you clean on the thigh 

00:04:43.770 --> 00:04:48.930
 clean and on the clean knee not on the finger does 

00:04:46.350 --> 00:04:50.700
 the biggest dirt and there you will have a 

00:04:48.930 --> 00:04:56.130
 more work to clean it up 

00:04:50.700 --> 00:04:58.470
 then time to clean the nail corner 

00:04:56.130 --> 00:05:00.810
 The expectation is that you can pick up 

00:04:58.470 --> 00:05:03.270
 always a fair amount of 

00:05:00.810 --> 00:05:05.820
 cotton that does not remain know and 

00:05:03.270 --> 00:05:09.840
 jirad, just right, it's perfect 

00:05:05.820 --> 00:05:11.700
 But reality is something else, people. 

00:05:09.840 --> 00:05:14.910
 I can never get the right amount 

00:05:11.700 --> 00:05:17.250
 of cotton and worst of all I always 

00:05:14.910 --> 00:05:19.320
 cotton back of the nail that has barely finished 

00:05:17.250 --> 00:05:20.010
 of drying does not taste or finish 

00:05:19.320 --> 00:05:22.380
 dry 

00:05:20.010 --> 00:05:25.140
 so what happens is changing the 

00:05:22.380 --> 00:05:28.110
 my nail and how to remove it without erasing 

00:05:25.140 --> 00:05:30.390
 It's not like he ended up giving everything and not 

00:05:28.110 --> 00:05:33.150
 There's a way I'm going to have to take the 

00:05:30.390 --> 00:05:34.830
 enamel and pass it back to and it was 

00:05:33.150 --> 00:05:36.240
 same finger that we did the digging 

00:05:34.830 --> 00:05:39.450
 with toothpick 

00:05:36.240 --> 00:05:42.230
 let's breathe count to three try and 

00:05:39.450 --> 00:05:42.230
 pass again 

00:05:48.970 --> 00:05:53.930
 Let's go back to the stick. 

00:05:51.290 --> 00:05:56.450
 the expectation is that you can take 

00:05:53.930 --> 00:05:58.400
 all right and not about nor one 

00:05:56.450 --> 00:06:00.770
 small amount of enamel residue is 

00:05:58.400 --> 00:06:03.590
 that perfect enamelling that neither 

00:06:00.770 --> 00:06:05.780
 When we leave the room, you know that 

00:06:03.590 --> 00:06:08.930
 guesses in any study reality 

00:06:05.780 --> 00:06:10.970
 We look like joke, but that's okay. 

00:06:08.930 --> 00:06:13.010
 You could put the cotton in the 

00:06:10.970 --> 00:06:13.910
 toothpick got right after a lot 

00:06:13.010 --> 00:06:16.310
 Time, right? 

00:06:13.910 --> 00:06:18.830
 and it's time to spend there on the finger 

00:06:16.310 --> 00:06:21.890
 to take the blur that happens 

00:06:18.830 --> 00:06:24.440
 You go and fuck again in the same place. 

00:06:21.890 --> 00:06:26.570
 on the same finger that you have already passed 

00:06:24.440 --> 00:06:29.420
 the enamel did not know how many times 

00:06:26.570 --> 00:06:31.640
 Only this time we are already 

00:06:29.420 --> 00:06:33.800
 patience and will not take away the 

00:06:31.640 --> 00:06:35.930
 Not again we will try to make a 

00:06:33.800 --> 00:06:37.850
 cambalacho there and will pass the enamel 

00:06:35.930 --> 00:06:40.010
 above it has no problem going 

00:06:37.850 --> 00:06:42.560
 look like you tried to pack 

00:06:40.010 --> 00:06:45.230
 Lina and life goes on in my people then 

00:06:42.560 --> 00:06:47.870
 Let's go back and clean the 

00:06:45.230 --> 00:06:48.770
 nails and there is little left for us 

00:06:47.870 --> 00:06:52.310
 finish 

00:06:48.770 --> 00:06:54.440
 finally our final straight nail 

00:06:52.310 --> 00:06:57.020
 now our expectation is that everything 

00:06:54.440 --> 00:06:59.450
 end in the greatest peace in us and that the 

00:06:57.020 --> 00:07:01.940
 time to finish it would do it at home 

00:06:59.450 --> 00:07:04.010
 be a maximum of 30 minutes 

00:07:01.940 --> 00:07:06.410
 of course I was with a score of 

00:07:04.010 --> 00:07:09.970
 room is to get everything cute not 

00:07:06.410 --> 00:07:13.340
 Enamel remains in the corner. 

00:07:09.970 --> 00:07:16.460
 but this is the sad reality people 

00:07:13.340 --> 00:07:18.440
 You can not always clean everything right. 

00:07:16.460 --> 00:07:20.030
 remains of enamel you leave to 

00:07:18.440 --> 00:07:21.980
 get out of the bath, right? 

00:07:20.030 --> 00:07:24.950
 and we must not forget that a fingernail 

00:07:21.980 --> 00:07:26.780
 always different from other people 

00:07:24.950 --> 00:07:28.220
 try as left is totally 

00:07:26.780 --> 00:07:29.000
 different than painting by hand 

00:07:28.220 --> 00:07:31.910
 right 

00:07:29.000 --> 00:07:34.130
 always becomes different and of course this is the 

00:07:31.910 --> 00:07:35.900
 mess that is at the bottom right and 

00:07:34.130 --> 00:07:37.790
 with which you more 

00:07:35.900 --> 00:07:38.660
 I'm sure it stays in the 

00:07:37.790 --> 00:07:40.430
 reality 

00:07:38.660 --> 00:07:43.930
 I hope you liked a kiss. 

00:07:40.430 --> 00:07:43.930
 very large and until the next video
