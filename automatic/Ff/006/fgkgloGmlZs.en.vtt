00:00:00.770 --> 00:00:06.930
 ah ah ah there guys beauty more 

00:00:05.430 --> 00:00:08.309
 quiet wines here 

00:00:06.930 --> 00:00:09.840
 a watcher was the monster spirit 

00:00:08.309 --> 00:00:11.880
 I was just like the worst in our series 

00:00:09.840 --> 00:00:13.650
 Do not ask the video very fast today. 

00:00:11.880 --> 00:00:15.870
 different a tip for you a tutorial 

00:00:13.650 --> 00:00:17.550
 always noticed a change in the screen and 

00:00:15.870 --> 00:00:18.690
 in the image at resolution 

00:00:17.550 --> 00:00:20.910
 I'll introduce you to a 

00:00:18.690 --> 00:00:22.050
 fixer fix there because I asked 

00:00:20.910 --> 00:00:23.760
 in the past episode 

00:00:22.050 --> 00:00:25.529
 if anyone knew of a program that 

00:00:23.760 --> 00:00:27.359
 change this screen resolution to be ill 

00:00:25.529 --> 00:00:29.099
 country that has demonstrated the first 

00:00:27.359 --> 00:00:30.990
 level and clear and if you leave it 

00:00:29.099 --> 00:00:32.430
 I find something of the type I listen to 

00:00:30.990 --> 00:00:34.230
 dick scoundrel introduced me to the program 

00:00:32.430 --> 00:00:36.059
 very cool that I found on google 

00:00:34.230 --> 00:00:38.760
 good crowd was following this effort 

00:00:36.059 --> 00:00:41.160
 which is the version of the 2005 2004 2005 

00:00:38.760 --> 00:00:43.980
 ancient original shows how much it has 

00:00:41.160 --> 00:00:46.469
 screen resolution at a maximum of 1024 per 

00:00:43.980 --> 00:00:48.539
 768 thing of sorts but it 's a resolution 

00:00:46.469 --> 00:00:50.250
 very low because this game was planned 

00:00:48.539 --> 00:00:52.079
 for small engines at the time 

00:00:50.250 --> 00:00:54.149
 had very large hd monitors and 

00:00:52.079 --> 00:00:56.070
 everything they did in xp for 

00:00:54.149 --> 00:00:58.530
 very small solution and today I have the 

00:00:56.070 --> 00:01:00.140
 windows 7 with a reduction is much higher than 

00:00:58.530 --> 00:01:03.359
 my 17 inch monitor screen 

00:01:00.140 --> 00:01:04.979
 resolution of 1600 1900 and I will give this 

00:01:03.359 --> 00:01:07.140
 game it gets too small and with 

00:01:04.979 --> 00:01:08.610
 those black stripes next to me are not I 

00:01:07.140 --> 00:01:11.430
 I wanted to change that up there to see it. 

00:01:08.610 --> 00:01:13.260
 The better the game is to play better at something. 

00:01:11.430 --> 00:01:15.119
 some more details and also in the 

00:01:13.260 --> 00:01:18.630
 recording is a higher resolution and 

00:01:15.119 --> 00:01:20.340
 because that's where to record the series of 

00:01:18.630 --> 00:01:22.500
 past episodes is more to stay one 

00:01:20.340 --> 00:01:24.030
 stretched because we get black edges 

00:01:22.500 --> 00:01:25.560
 in the edition had to take safety 

00:01:24.030 --> 00:01:28.590
 main take I have to stretch the 

00:01:25.560 --> 00:01:32.220
 video and features 16 the template nf shows 

00:01:28.590 --> 00:01:35.460
 nfs our bank and lautner or fsm w 

00:01:32.220 --> 00:01:37.680
 remains and also has the nfc mw is the ex 

00:01:35.460 --> 00:01:39.570
 benfiquista and has these various names and 

00:01:37.680 --> 00:01:41.759
 which will fix a program that I 

00:01:39.570 --> 00:01:43.140
 I think but I do not recommend using it 's a 

00:01:41.759 --> 00:01:44.100
 of them that I thought I would not let 

00:01:43.140 --> 00:01:45.930
 for you guys 

00:01:44.100 --> 00:01:49.470
 it changes the screen resolution looks good 

00:01:45.930 --> 00:01:52.799
 It's just cool that the dials - 

00:01:49.470 --> 00:01:54.750
 much lower you know it's too small 

00:01:52.799 --> 00:01:56.369
 is on the left side of the screen but I'm 

00:01:54.750 --> 00:01:57.869
 trying to point the mouse here to 

00:01:56.369 --> 00:02:00.119
 I do not know if it will work 

00:01:57.869 --> 00:02:02.549
 he stays in this part here is where I am 

00:02:00.119 --> 00:02:04.890
 showing that this plate is yellow 

00:02:02.549 --> 00:02:05.670
 for example it becomes that the speedometer is 

00:02:04.890 --> 00:02:07.400
 too bad 

00:02:05.670 --> 00:02:10.700
 Then I found one other than the one inscribed 

00:02:07.400 --> 00:02:12.980
 amended or disconnected, and cnfs mw res that I 

00:02:10.700 --> 00:02:14.540
 leave that you are lowering is easy 

00:02:12.980 --> 00:02:16.850
 to install and use is a program 

00:02:14.540 --> 00:02:18.920
 so are you going to download and will come a 

00:02:16.850 --> 00:02:21.350
 compressed file ie it will 

00:02:18.920 --> 00:02:22.910
 visit the error file and it will open 

00:02:21.350 --> 00:02:24.710
 will unzip these files send 

00:02:22.910 --> 00:02:26.930
 Wherever you want, you burn from what 

00:02:24.710 --> 00:02:28.370
 send these two files to the folder 

00:02:26.930 --> 00:02:29.810
 the link to the video shows before 

00:02:28.370 --> 00:02:31.940
 installation whether you go in my 

00:02:29.810 --> 00:02:34.160
 computer says put the files and 

00:02:31.940 --> 00:02:37.610
 windows 7 programs should be that the 

00:02:34.160 --> 00:02:38.930
 Type banks x86 programs the police 

00:02:37.610 --> 00:02:41.209
 Damn it for me here. 

00:02:38.930 --> 00:02:42.800
 There you go there and games and then you go. 

00:02:41.209 --> 00:02:44.390
 on the passage from March before in. 

00:02:42.800 --> 00:02:46.880
 the proposal to ban mÃ¡rcio andrade 

00:02:44.390 --> 00:02:48.800
 passed - basics you will paste these 

00:02:46.880 --> 00:02:50.720
 two files you extracted from the wrong 

00:02:48.800 --> 00:02:54.709
 and there is a basic program lx is a 

00:02:50.720 --> 00:02:57.080
 executable nfs-and w3c will open it and it is 

00:02:54.709 --> 00:02:58.490
 A fairly basic problem is well 

00:02:57.080 --> 00:03:00.260
 he will be there indicating that 

00:02:58.490 --> 00:03:02.540
 the resolution will want to put place 

00:03:00.260 --> 00:03:05.000
 resolution on your screen of your 

00:03:02.540 --> 00:03:06.620
 computer in my case I felt 900 

00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:09.440
 the police also in me will read 

00:03:06.620 --> 00:03:10.280
 legal disruption that is also a target for 

00:03:09.440 --> 00:03:11.750
 you do not know 

00:03:10.280 --> 00:03:13.670
 then you put the resolution without you 

00:03:11.750 --> 00:03:15.110
 know resolution if it goes in yours is in your 

00:03:13.670 --> 00:03:16.940
 desktop put to solve is 

00:03:15.110 --> 00:03:19.130
 resolution of the right contran will see 

00:03:16.940 --> 00:03:21.050
 resolutions put there it will put the 

00:03:19.130 --> 00:03:22.610
 update your game it will not 

00:03:21.050 --> 00:03:24.290
 update 1.0 does not work, nor does a 

00:03:22.610 --> 00:03:25.820
 against and it will work to 

00:03:24.290 --> 00:03:30.170
 demonstrate if you put death in the 

00:03:25.820 --> 00:03:32.450
 demo on 1.129.130 1.3 selects and presses 

00:03:30.170 --> 00:03:34.250
 the button there hunty bolatti is going to 

00:03:32.450 --> 00:03:36.320
 I got police, the drug has a problem. 

00:03:34.250 --> 00:03:38.570
 button out will do if we are speed 

00:03:36.320 --> 00:03:40.489
 most wanted open is automatically 

00:03:38.570 --> 00:03:42.290
 suddenly the solution that you 

00:03:40.489 --> 00:03:44.690
 choose the resolution that you 

00:03:42.290 --> 00:03:45.860
 put in the fields and there is only joy 

00:03:44.690 --> 00:03:47.989
 Only people who have a problem, he's a 

00:03:45.860 --> 00:03:49.220
 vine file is to run your twitter 

00:03:47.989 --> 00:03:50.750
 I have always been able to help in the evolution 

00:03:49.220 --> 00:03:52.850
 Whatever you want I'll have to be 

00:03:50.750 --> 00:03:54.650
 open , or you'll have to push open 

00:03:52.850 --> 00:03:56.930
 Where you do not want to just let you leave 

00:03:54.650 --> 00:03:58.670
 it open and push some icons 

00:03:56.930 --> 00:04:00.260
 normal opening of the game that will 

00:03:58.670 --> 00:04:01.549
 to run only has another problem has to 

00:04:00.260 --> 00:04:03.560
 be open and set a resolution 

00:04:01.549 --> 00:04:05.600
 that you chose that will not work 

00:04:03.560 --> 00:04:07.700
 It was simply will have to go to 

00:04:05.600 --> 00:04:09.470
 You 're going to make an improvement in the series. 

00:04:07.700 --> 00:04:11.600
 It used to be that we used this camera before. 

00:04:09.470 --> 00:04:14.260
 here only that as the screen is bigger I 

00:04:11.600 --> 00:04:17.260
 I'm going to streamline this camera now. 

00:04:14.260 --> 00:04:19.419
 the environment, everything else and I know that 

00:04:17.260 --> 00:04:21.880
 speedometer and map were higher in 

00:04:19.419 --> 00:04:23.169
 relation to the other solution but this is 

00:04:21.880 --> 00:04:24.669
 normal you have to get used 

00:04:23.169 --> 00:04:26.199
 I wanted some feedback from you guys. 

00:04:24.669 --> 00:04:28.240
 want screen resolution did not stay 

00:04:26.199 --> 00:04:30.430
 better not change anything because the address 

00:04:28.240 --> 00:04:31.210
 a lower resolution resolution with the file 

00:04:30.430 --> 00:04:33.010
 gets smaller 

00:04:31.210 --> 00:04:34.330
 you will get very big and on youtube 

00:04:33.010 --> 00:04:36.550
 also need to indemnify 

00:04:34.330 --> 00:04:38.440
 1600 but I already felt that I think 

00:04:36.550 --> 00:04:40.330
 The better China better then it seems 

00:04:38.440 --> 00:04:42.729
 only you find that a simple to be 

00:04:40.330 --> 00:04:45.130
 installed and used only that was the problem 

00:04:42.729 --> 00:04:48.280
 it is that you always have to run 

00:04:45.130 --> 00:04:50.410
 If I play, do not play the game, that's it. 

00:04:48.280 --> 00:04:52.270
 I do not know if the history in this template 

00:04:50.410 --> 00:04:54.100
 Fixed problem in using it none 

00:04:52.270 --> 00:04:55.030
 kind of hacking a thing that will te 

00:04:54.100 --> 00:04:56.860
 bani 

00:04:55.030 --> 00:04:58.900
 I think you can not use it in multiplayer 

00:04:56.860 --> 00:05:01.150
 but nowadays I think nobody's playing 

00:04:58.900 --> 00:05:03.460
 the title of this game here and that's it 

00:05:01.150 --> 00:05:05.169
 or do I like you like the 

00:05:03.460 --> 00:05:08.380
 favorites in the dissemination and evaluation of 

00:05:05.169 --> 00:05:09.970
 video to pass a plane again here and 

00:05:08.380 --> 00:05:11.949
 send feedback in comments because 

00:05:09.970 --> 00:05:14.020
 did not like the comments I want 

00:05:11.949 --> 00:05:15.460
 comment your here in this video be 

00:05:14.020 --> 00:05:18.660
 enrolled in the channel only here in the neighborhood 

00:05:15.460 --> 00:05:24.300
 button write yes, that 's it guys 

00:05:18.660 --> 00:05:24.300
 lotou leaked spoke
