number six PRG programming one to five

00:02:00.170 --> 00:02:03.039 
number six PRG programming one to five
means<00:02:00.439> it's<00:02:00.619> setting<00:02:01.179> for<00:02:02.179> a<00:02:02.210> five<00:02:02.509> day<00:02:02.749> period

00:02:03.039 --> 00:02:03.049 
means it's setting for a five day period

00:02:03.049 --> 00:02:09.999 
means it's setting for a five day period
and<00:02:03.350> then<00:02:03.469> a<00:02:03.499> two<00:02:03.799> day<00:02:04.009> period<00:02:04.299> separately<00:02:09.009> by

00:02:09.999 --> 00:02:10.009 
and then a two day period separately by

00:02:10.009 --> 00:02:12.190 
and then a two day period separately by
hitting<00:02:10.280> the<00:02:10.460> arrows<00:02:10.789> we<00:02:11.000> now<00:02:11.150> go<00:02:11.360> to<00:02:11.420> six<00:02:11.870> and

00:02:12.190 --> 00:02:12.200 
hitting the arrows we now go to six and

00:02:12.200 --> 00:02:16.150 
hitting the arrows we now go to six and
one<00:02:13.069> different<00:02:13.400> for<00:02:13.700> the<00:02:13.819> sunday<00:02:14.470> or<00:02:15.470> the<00:02:15.950> same

00:02:16.150 --> 00:02:16.160 
one different for the sunday or the same

00:02:16.160 --> 00:02:19.000 
one different for the sunday or the same
for<00:02:16.400> seven<00:02:16.670> days<00:02:17.080> your<00:02:18.080> other<00:02:18.319> option<00:02:18.650> on<00:02:18.770> this

00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:19.010 
for seven days your other option on this

00:02:19.010 --> 00:02:21.220 
for seven days your other option on this
is<00:02:19.340> if<00:02:19.550> you<00:02:19.700> turn<00:02:19.880> that<00:02:20.060> off<00:02:20.120> it<00:02:20.900> would<00:02:21.050> mean

00:02:21.220 --> 00:02:21.230 
is if you turn that off it would mean

00:02:21.230 --> 00:02:23.710 
is if you turn that off it would mean
the<00:02:21.400> control<00:02:22.400> will<00:02:22.580> run<00:02:22.760> just<00:02:22.970> on<00:02:23.240> a<00:02:23.270> manual

00:02:23.710 --> 00:02:23.720 
the control will run just on a manual

00:02:23.720 --> 00:02:25.600 
the control will run just on a manual
setting<00:02:23.930> then<00:02:24.680> you<00:02:24.770> would<00:02:24.890> just<00:02:24.920> regulate<00:02:25.459> it

00:02:25.600 --> 00:02:25.610 
setting then you would just regulate it

00:02:25.610 --> 00:02:27.929 
setting then you would just regulate it
with<00:02:25.730> your<00:02:25.850> app

00:02:27.929 --> 00:02:27.939 
with your app

00:02:27.939 --> 00:02:34.809 
with your app
so<00:02:28.939> we'll<00:02:29.090> go<00:02:29.239> back<00:02:29.450> to<00:02:31.810> seven<00:02:32.810> days<00:02:33.760> now<00:02:34.760> we

00:02:34.809 --> 00:02:34.819 
so we'll go back to seven days now we

00:02:34.819 --> 00:02:37.809 
so we'll go back to seven days now we
turn<00:02:35.150> their<00:02:35.359> control<00:02:35.780> off<00:02:36.250> turn<00:02:37.250> it<00:02:37.370> on<00:02:37.489> again

00:02:37.809 --> 00:02:37.819 
turn their control off turn it on again

00:02:37.819 --> 00:02:42.819 
turn their control off turn it on again
and<00:02:38.209> we<00:02:38.299> can<00:02:38.480> start<00:02:38.719> setting<00:02:39.170> it<00:02:41.680> there's<00:02:42.680> two

00:02:42.819 --> 00:02:42.829 
and we can start setting it there's two

00:02:42.829 --> 00:02:44.559
