00:00:09.769 --> 00:00:13.259
 mister but I hope your colleague has 

00:00:12.120 --> 00:00:15.839
 spoke of technical error of the referee 

00:00:13.259 --> 00:00:18.869
 in relation to the alleged double yellow 

00:00:15.839 --> 00:00:20.189
 of prison with the possibility of a 

00:00:18.869 --> 00:00:21.449
 technical error then a repetition 

00:00:20.189 --> 00:00:22.800
 of the match 

00:00:21.449 --> 00:00:24.630
 in short, from the field what sensations it has 

00:00:22.800 --> 00:00:26.400
 had that comment can do I say in 

00:00:24.630 --> 00:00:28.199
 official way if maspero wants it 

00:00:26.400 --> 00:00:30.029
 play at 11 tonight we are 

00:00:28.199 --> 00:00:31.920
 available if you want to play tomorrow 

00:00:30.029 --> 00:00:33.329
 we replay it if it doesn't choose him 

00:00:31.920 --> 00:00:36.090
 he gave it when he wants to play it 

00:00:33.329 --> 00:00:38.460
 region okay I think they maspero 

00:00:36.090 --> 00:00:40.290
 must go to lourdes and if it is to do one 

00:00:38.460 --> 00:00:42.059
 beautiful prayer to the Madonna for how she has 

00:00:40.290 --> 00:00:44.070
 equalized the game overall 

00:00:42.059 --> 00:00:47.100
 all respect for this team 

00:00:44.070 --> 00:00:48.960
 but as he drew I think that 

00:00:47.100 --> 00:00:50.969
 should go to lourdes if he then 

00:00:48.960 --> 00:00:52.620
 wants to benefit all respect masks 

00:00:50.969 --> 00:00:55.949
 a big coach wants her to play 

00:00:52.620 --> 00:00:58.140
 tonight he would choose the day tomorrow 

00:00:55.949 --> 00:01:01.350
 we turn it over to the stationed head 

00:00:58.140 --> 00:01:03.090
 utopian I give my word of honor that 

00:01:01.350 --> 00:01:03.960
 I didn't notice I was giving mine 

00:01:03.090 --> 00:01:06.540
 word of honor 

00:01:03.960 --> 00:01:08.159
 but if there was an error I don't know 

00:01:06.540 --> 00:01:10.439
 is he wants to play it again 

00:01:08.159 --> 00:01:12.659
 when he wants he chooses the time is 

00:01:10.439 --> 00:01:14.159
 he the day to play it there 

00:01:12.659 --> 00:01:15.240
 feeling that anyway this point does not 

00:01:14.159 --> 00:01:17.610
 satisfied her to the end 

00:01:15.240 --> 00:01:18.750
 especially as the goal came 

00:01:17.610 --> 00:01:21.930
 of the draw of the pavia 

00:01:18.750 --> 00:01:24.299
 at this point I start in one 

00:01:21.930 --> 00:01:25.860
 programming would have put me there 

00:01:24.299 --> 00:01:28.140
 signed with my son's blood on 

00:01:25.860 --> 00:01:30.740
 this is not a shadow of a doubt game 

00:01:28.140 --> 00:01:32.939
 of great suffering in the first half 

00:01:30.740 --> 00:01:35.000
 interpreted as best he could not 

00:01:32.939 --> 00:01:38.790
 be interpreted because with a wind 

00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:41.130
 therefore greatly in favor of the pavia 

00:01:38.790 --> 00:01:42.630
 we tried not to let you kick 

00:01:41.130 --> 00:01:44.899
 from the middle distance because they had 

00:01:42.630 --> 00:01:47.009
 excellent shooters and we gave them 

00:01:44.899 --> 00:01:48.630
 some cross and then we have it 

00:01:47.009 --> 00:01:50.430
 interpreted very well then we had 

00:01:48.630 --> 00:01:52.530
 the luck to go ahead and 

00:01:50.430 --> 00:01:54.600
 normal that the second half a team 

00:01:52.530 --> 00:01:56.969
 true as I think the art must 

00:01:54.600 --> 00:01:59.070
 manage tender and we managed in 

00:01:56.969 --> 00:02:01.080
 disarmingly 

00:01:59.070 --> 00:02:03.659
 I never had any doubts that we couldn't 

00:02:01.080 --> 00:02:06.510
 winning this race then is normal 

00:02:03.659 --> 00:02:10.170
 take that flight with 60 meters ball at 

00:02:06.510 --> 00:02:12.390
 foot in a vertical field situation 

00:02:10.170 --> 00:02:14.610
 your balls spin in a remarkable way 

00:02:12.390 --> 00:02:18.350
 whoever made a mistake will pay, I accept 

00:02:14.610 --> 00:02:20.700
 all from a footballer a technical error 

00:02:18.350 --> 00:02:23.100
 any type of error except the 

00:02:20.700 --> 00:02:25.050
 errors of suffering of anyone amnesia 

00:02:23.100 --> 00:02:29.250
 he did not play then instead 

00:02:25.050 --> 00:02:32.370
 they are stubborn when someone else me 

00:02:29.250 --> 00:02:33.870
 I don't accuse anyone, I don't owe you one 

00:02:32.370 --> 00:02:35.760
 give notice when there was from 

00:02:33.870 --> 00:02:37.950
 I always emphasize a player 

00:02:35.760 --> 00:02:39.540
 emphasized when it came from 

00:02:37.950 --> 00:02:43.020
 never attack a player 

00:02:39.540 --> 00:02:46.290
 done except that hysteria scene 

00:02:43.020 --> 00:02:47.580
 I tell my wife in Alessandria, but I tell you that 

00:02:46.290 --> 00:02:50.220
 players I speak in the closed of 

00:02:47.580 --> 00:02:52.709
 locker room there was more than one mistake 

00:02:50.220 --> 00:02:56.070
 I am largely disappointed because a 

00:02:52.709 --> 00:02:58.320
 this point we could have made a 

00:02:56.070 --> 00:03:00.810
 half miracle 40 points to have beaten 

00:02:58.320 --> 00:03:02.730
 also the pavia after the umpteenth big one 

00:03:00.810 --> 00:03:04.350
 performance I want to remind everyone that 

00:03:02.730 --> 00:03:07.799
 five owners were missing in mine 

00:03:04.350 --> 00:03:09.930
 team no and so i mean beat 

00:03:07.799 --> 00:03:12.150
 even the equal to would have really been 

00:03:09.930 --> 00:03:13.920
 a masterpiece he said before they are missing 

00:03:12.150 --> 00:03:17.610
 six points to salvation 

00:03:13.920 --> 00:03:19.680
 I am convinced I run on me 

00:03:17.610 --> 00:03:21.180
 same I never think I am 

00:03:19.680 --> 00:03:23.700
 unbalanced 

00:03:21.180 --> 00:03:25.799
 I believe that at 44 also being in 

00:03:23.700 --> 00:03:28.440
 I benefit in direct confrontations 

00:03:25.799 --> 00:03:30.420
 so i think 44 is safe 

00:03:28.440 --> 00:03:33.720
 so in 10 games we have to do six 

00:03:30.420 --> 00:03:36.060
 points and therefore only if I had to 

00:03:33.720 --> 00:03:38.160
 go crazy or a should happen 

00:03:36.060 --> 00:03:40.590
 cataclysm to be able to move backwards into the 

00:03:38.160 --> 00:03:44.130
 football you never know but I do 

00:03:40.590 --> 00:03:46.799
 rush on myself and believe you are points 

00:03:44.130 --> 00:03:51.930
 there is mathematical salvation perhaps 

00:03:46.799 --> 00:03:52.769
 also at 43, however, 44 I think there is a 

00:03:51.930 --> 00:03:54.750
 salvation 

00:03:52.769 --> 00:03:56.610
 we say that in lumezzane the reads that with 

00:03:54.750 --> 00:03:58.440
 first match point 

00:03:56.610 --> 00:04:00.510
 I think I left out 

00:03:58.440 --> 00:04:03.090
 sabatino that I could have risked it 

00:04:00.510 --> 00:04:04.890
 precisely because the fundamental game 

00:04:03.090 --> 00:04:07.290
 that of lumezzane today with pavia knows us 

00:04:04.890 --> 00:04:08.700
 that all my life is not green however 

00:04:07.290 --> 00:04:10.650
 fundamental game is that of 

00:04:08.700 --> 00:04:12.360
 lumezzane surely not lose a 

00:04:10.650 --> 00:04:15.330
 lumezzane we would have done another 

00:04:12.360 --> 00:04:19.040
 great step forward also because the 

00:04:15.330 --> 00:04:19.040
 lumezzane has 9 points behind you
