00:02:26.680 --> 00:02:30.550 

now<00:02:27.680> I'll<00:02:27.830> do<00:02:27.980> many<00:02:28.460> variations<00:02:28.970> in<00:02:29.540> let's<00:02:30.470> say

00:02:30.550 --> 00:02:30.560 
now I'll do many variations in let's say

00:02:30.560 --> 00:02:31.150 
now I'll do many variations in let's say
the<00:02:30.680> Phils

00:02:31.150 --> 00:02:31.160 
the Phils

00:02:31.160 --> 00:02:34.990 
the Phils
and<00:02:32.319> when<00:02:33.319> I'm<00:02:33.440> always<00:02:33.620> sticking<00:02:34.190> to<00:02:34.520> the<00:02:34.700> the

00:02:34.990 --> 00:02:35.000 
and when I'm always sticking to the the

00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:35.830 
and when I'm always sticking to the the
course<00:02:35.240> of<00:02:35.420> course

00:02:35.830 --> 00:02:35.840 
course of course

00:02:35.840 --> 00:02:40.560 
course of course
for<00:02:36.290> example<00:02:36.830> the<00:02:37.310> F<00:02:38.500> diminished<00:02:39.500> chords<00:02:40.250> in

00:02:40.560 --> 00:02:40.570 
for example the F diminished chords in

00:02:40.570 --> 00:02:45.110 
for example the F diminished chords in
the<00:02:41.570> third<00:02:41.780> line<00:02:42.020> lost<00:02:42.410> body

00:02:45.110 --> 00:02:45.120 

00:02:45.120 --> 00:02:47.330 

you<00:02:45.930> can<00:02:46.110> do<00:02:46.260> some<00:02:46.409> variations<00:02:46.890> in<00:02:47.010> the<00:02:47.099> Ryan

00:02:47.330 --> 00:02:47.340 
you can do some variations in the Ryan

00:02:47.340 --> 00:02:52.309 
you can do some variations in the Ryan
hands<00:02:48.799> or<00:02:49.799> you<00:02:50.549> can<00:02:50.580> move<00:02:51.450> it<00:02:51.629> up<00:02:51.750> for<00:02:52.049> friends

00:02:52.309 --> 00:02:52.319 
hands or you can move it up for friends

00:02:52.319 --> 00:02:54.530 
hands or you can move it up for friends
you<00:02:52.739> know<00:02:53.250> that<00:02:53.280> if<00:02:53.640> you<00:02:53.790> move<00:02:54.209> up<00:02:54.420> a

00:02:54.530 --> 00:02:54.540 
you know that if you move up a

00:02:54.540 --> 00:02:57.080 
you know that if you move up a
diminished<00:02:54.959> chords<00:02:55.349> for<00:02:56.069> frets<00:02:56.430> in<00:02:56.700> the<00:02:56.819> same

00:02:57.080 --> 00:02:57.090 
diminished chords for frets in the same

00:02:57.090 --> 00:02:59.420 
diminished chords for frets in the same
chord<00:02:57.480> if<00:02:57.720> you<00:02:57.840> calculate<00:02:58.440> it<00:02:58.470> there's<00:02:59.220> an

00:02:59.420 --> 00:02:59.430 
chord if you calculate it there's an

00:02:59.430 --> 00:03:03.259 
chord if you calculate it there's an
f-sharp<00:02:59.730> here<00:03:00.590> that<00:03:01.590> F<00:03:01.739> sharp<00:03:01.769> is<00:03:02.280> know<00:03:02.549> where

00:03:03.259 --> 00:03:03.269 
f-sharp here that F sharp is know where

00:03:03.269 --> 00:03:05.110 
f-sharp here that F sharp is know where
it<00:03:03.510> is

00:03:05.110 --> 00:03:05.120 
it is

00:03:05.120 --> 00:03:12.830 
it is
etc<00:03:08.420> that's<00:03:09.420> all<00:03:09.629> same<00:03:09.980> so<00:03:11.420> you<00:03:12.420> could<00:03:12.569> do<00:03:12.659> for

00:03:12.830 --> 00:03:12.840 
etc that's all same so you could do for

00:03:12.840 --> 00:03:15.559 
etc that's all same so you could do for
using<00:03:13.170> on<00:03:13.560> that

00:03:15.559 --> 00:03:15.569 
using on that

00:03:15.569 --> 00:03:19.880 
using on that
and<00:03:16.579> also<00:03:17.579> rhythmic<00:03:18.150> variations<00:03:18.689> when<00:03:19.590> you<00:03:19.709> go

00:03:19.880 --> 00:03:19.890 
and also rhythmic variations when you go

00:03:19.890 --> 00:03:35.440 
and also rhythmic variations when you go
to<00:03:19.950> a<00:03:21.500> court<00:03:26.120> which<00:03:27.120> is<00:03:27.269> right<00:03:27.540> on<00:03:27.719> the<00:03:27.810> beat

00:03:35.440 --> 00:03:35.450 

00:03:35.450 --> 00:03:37.480 

and<00:03:35.660> then<00:03:35.810> we<00:03:35.930> have<00:03:36.080> some<00:03:36.830> different

00:03:37.480 --> 00:03:37.490 
and then we have some different

00:03:37.490 --> 00:03:44.820 
and then we have some different
turnarounds<00:03:38.090> also<00:03:38.450> so<00:03:39.200> in<00:03:39.380> the<00:03:39.470> Tavis

00:03:44.820 --> 00:03:44.830 

00:03:44.830 --> 00:03:53.240 

and<00:03:45.760> I<00:03:45.970> also<00:03:46.120> did<00:03:46.480> one

00:03:53.240 --> 00:03:53.250 

00:03:53.250 --> 00:03:57.400 

today's<00:03:55.010> 4/5<00:03:56.010> second<00:03:56.310> string<00:03:56.520> third<00:03:56.850> fret

00:04:13.460 --> 00:04:13.470 

00:04:13.470 --> 00:04:21.850 

Oh<00:04:15.799> Peter

00:04:21.850 --> 00:04:21.860 

00:04:21.860 --> 00:04:26.610 

sequence

00:04:26.610 --> 00:04:26.620 

00:04:26.620 --> 00:04:31.720 

okay<00:04:27.620> now<00:04:27.890> the<00:04:28.340> solo<00:04:30.100> I'm<00:04:31.100> playing<00:04:31.580> that

okay now the solo I'm playing that

00:04:31.730 --> 00:04:34.420 
okay now the solo I'm playing that
faster<00:04:32.360> than<00:04:32.510> it<00:04:32.660> is<00:04:32.810> tapped<00:04:33.140> out<00:04:33.380> so<00:04:34.070> you<00:04:34.130> can

00:04:34.420 --> 00:04:34.430 
faster than it is tapped out so you can

00:04:34.430 --> 00:04:37.660 
faster than it is tapped out so you can
have<00:04:34.870> to<00:04:35.870> take<00:04:36.110> some<00:04:36.290> liberties<00:04:36.440> there<00:04:36.890> I'll

00:04:37.660 --> 00:04:37.670 
have to take some liberties there I'll

00:04:37.670 --> 00:05:04.300 
have to take some liberties there I'll
