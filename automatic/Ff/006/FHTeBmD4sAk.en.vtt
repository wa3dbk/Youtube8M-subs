the<00:01:01.640> first<00:01:01.879> time<00:01:02.299> that<00:01:02.540> I<00:01:02.570> played<00:01:02.839> this<00:01:02.960> game

00:01:03.039 --> 00:01:03.049 
the first time that I played this game

00:01:03.049 --> 00:01:05.380 
the first time that I played this game
it<00:01:03.379> reminded<00:01:03.769> me<00:01:03.830> of<00:01:03.979> berserk<00:01:04.400> meets<00:01:04.699> Robotron

00:01:05.380 --> 00:01:05.390 
it reminded me of berserk meets Robotron

00:01:05.390 --> 00:01:07.120 
it reminded me of berserk meets Robotron
because<00:01:05.720> it<00:01:05.840> has<00:01:05.990> the<00:01:06.200> twin<00:01:06.470> stick<00:01:06.770> style

00:01:07.120 --> 00:01:07.130 
because it has the twin stick style

00:01:07.130 --> 00:01:09.130 
because it has the twin stick style
shooting<00:01:07.460> controls<00:01:07.940> and<00:01:08.210> this<00:01:08.390> is<00:01:08.540> from<00:01:08.780> Stern

00:01:09.130 --> 00:01:09.140 
shooting controls and this is from Stern

00:01:09.140 --> 00:01:11.500 
shooting controls and this is from Stern
who<00:01:09.409> also<00:01:09.770> produced<00:01:10.159> beserk<00:01:10.640> but<00:01:11.270> it's<00:01:11.390> not

00:01:11.500 --> 00:01:11.510 
who also produced beserk but it's not

00:01:11.510 --> 00:01:13.390 
who also produced beserk but it's not
exactly<00:01:11.960> like<00:01:12.229> either<00:01:12.439> of<00:01:12.590> those<00:01:12.830> games<00:01:13.130> in

00:01:13.390 --> 00:01:13.400 
exactly like either of those games in

00:01:13.400 --> 00:01:14.859 
exactly like either of those games in
fact<00:01:13.610> it's<00:01:13.790> the<00:01:13.820> more<00:01:14.030> time<00:01:14.210> I<00:01:14.240> spent<00:01:14.600> with<00:01:14.659> it

00:01:14.859 --> 00:01:14.869 
fact it's the more time I spent with it

00:01:14.869 --> 00:01:17.260 
fact it's the more time I spent with it
the<00:01:14.990> more<00:01:15.170> it<00:01:15.260> reminded<00:01:15.710> me<00:01:15.770> of<00:01:16.040> gauntlet<00:01:16.850> with

00:01:17.260 --> 00:01:17.270 
the more it reminded me of gauntlet with

00:01:17.270 --> 00:01:20.350 
the more it reminded me of gauntlet with
some<00:01:17.990> serious<00:01:18.439> beserk<00:01:18.890> influence<00:01:19.490> because

00:01:20.350 --> 00:01:20.360 
some serious beserk influence because

00:01:20.360 --> 00:01:22.270 
some serious beserk influence because
