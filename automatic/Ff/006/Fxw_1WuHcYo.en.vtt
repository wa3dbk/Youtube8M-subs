want this to be one entire text box you
actually<00:01:16.510> want<00:01:16.750> to<00:01:16.869> split<00:01:17.140> it<00:01:17.200> in<00:01:17.409> two<00:01:17.439> columns

00:01:17.959 --> 00:01:17.969 
actually want to split it in two columns

00:01:17.969 --> 00:01:20.190 
actually want to split it in two columns
well<00:01:18.969> in<00:01:19.270> the<00:01:19.359> old<00:01:19.509> flash<00:01:19.750> you<00:01:19.990> would<00:01:20.109> actually

00:01:20.190 --> 00:01:20.200 
well in the old flash you would actually

00:01:20.200 --> 00:01:22.050 
well in the old flash you would actually
have<00:01:20.409> to<00:01:20.439> make<00:01:20.590> another<00:01:20.740> text<00:01:21.250> box<00:01:21.280> and<00:01:21.820> then

split<00:01:22.570> it<00:01:22.719> up<00:01:22.780> manually<00:01:23.140> but<00:01:24.070> here<00:01:24.490> if<00:01:24.640> we<00:01:25.210> go

00:01:25.349 --> 00:01:25.359 
split it up manually but here if we go

00:01:25.359 --> 00:01:27.480 
split it up manually but here if we go
to<00:01:25.420> our<00:01:25.630> properties<00:01:26.409> box<00:01:26.619> we'll<00:01:27.189> just<00:01:27.340> make

00:01:32.819 --> 00:01:32.829 
go to the properties box if we go down

00:01:32.829 --> 00:01:35.219 
go to the properties box if we go down
here<00:01:32.950> to<00:01:33.189> the<00:01:33.399> bottom<00:01:33.429> you'll<00:01:34.420> see<00:01:34.509> that<00:01:34.929> there

is<00:01:35.409> a<00:01:35.520> columns<00:01:36.520> option<00:01:37.109> so<00:01:38.109> let's<00:01:38.259> go<00:01:38.380> ahead

00:01:38.399 --> 00:01:38.409 
is a columns option so let's go ahead

00:01:38.409 --> 00:01:41.910 
is a columns option so let's go ahead
really<00:01:38.799> quick<00:01:39.070> and<00:01:39.219> just<00:01:39.280> put<00:01:39.729> in<00:01:39.969> two<00:01:40.810> and<00:01:41.140> hit

00:01:41.910 --> 00:01:41.920 
really quick and just put in two and hit

really quick and just put in two and hit
enter<00:01:42.179> you<00:01:43.179> can<00:01:43.359> see<00:01:43.569> that<00:01:43.600> it<00:01:43.929> automatically

00:01:44.550 --> 00:01:44.560 
enter you can see that it automatically

00:01:44.560 --> 00:01:47.039 
enter you can see that it automatically
changes<00:01:44.859> the<00:01:45.789> way<00:01:45.880> the<00:01:45.909> text<00:01:46.329> box<00:01:46.479> looks<00:01:46.810> and

00:01:47.039 --> 00:01:47.049 
changes the way the text box looks and

00:01:47.049 --> 00:01:49.499 
changes the way the text box looks and
puts<00:01:47.350> it<00:01:47.409> into<00:01:47.560> columns<00:01:48.069> and<00:01:48.340> of<00:01:48.880> course<00:01:49.119> you

00:01:49.499 --> 00:01:49.509 
puts it into columns and of course you

00:01:49.509 --> 00:01:52.200 
puts it into columns and of course you
can<00:01:49.749> change<00:01:50.380> this<00:01:50.799> to<00:01:51.039> how<00:01:51.249> many<00:01:51.310> columns<00:01:51.969> you

00:01:52.200 --> 00:01:52.210 
can change this to how many columns you

00:01:52.210 --> 00:01:55.260 
can change this to how many columns you
want<00:01:52.240> so<00:01:52.810> if<00:01:52.869> we<00:01:52.960> put<00:01:53.109> four<00:01:53.469> it'll<00:01:54.249> split<00:01:55.119> up

00:01:55.260 --> 00:01:55.270 
want so if we put four it'll split up

00:01:55.270 --> 00:01:58.679 
want so if we put four it'll split up
into<00:01:55.390> four<00:01:55.450> columns<00:01:56.130> so<00:01:57.130> you<00:01:58.119> can<00:01:58.240> also<00:01:58.420> adjust

00:01:58.679 --> 00:01:58.689

00:02:02.669 --> 00:02:02.679 
adjust the width of the gutters for

00:02:02.679 --> 00:02:04.230 
adjust the width of the gutters for
instance<00:02:03.009> and<00:02:03.340> you<00:02:03.460> just<00:02:03.609> click<00:02:03.880> hold<00:02:04.090> and

00:02:08.910 --> 00:02:08.920 
you're moving the space between the

00:02:08.920 --> 00:02:10.800 
you're moving the space between the
columns<00:02:09.250> and<00:02:09.940> all<00:02:10.000> that<00:02:10.149> kind<00:02:10.330> of<00:02:10.360> stuff<00:02:10.450> and

00:02:12.510 --> 00:02:12.520 
it seemed down here you can adjust the

00:02:12.520 --> 00:02:14.160 
it seemed down here you can adjust the
padding<00:02:12.910> for<00:02:13.090> instance<00:02:13.390> on<00:02:13.480> the<00:02:13.569> left<00:02:13.810> if<00:02:14.020> you

00:02:14.160 --> 00:02:14.170 
padding for instance on the left if you

00:02:14.170 --> 00:02:15.750 
padding for instance on the left if you
want<00:02:14.200> the<00:02:14.380> left<00:02:14.620> of<00:02:14.770> the<00:02:14.860> animal<00:02:15.190> in<00:02:15.370> more<00:02:15.610> you

00:02:15.750 --> 00:02:15.760 
want the left of the animal in more you

00:02:15.760 --> 00:02:19.309 
want the left of the animal in more you
can<00:02:15.880> do<00:02:16.030> it<00:02:16.150> like<00:02:16.300> that<00:02:16.480> the<00:02:17.410> right<00:02:17.650> and<00:02:18.030> so<00:02:19.030> on

00:02:19.309 --> 00:02:19.319 
can do it like that the right and so on

00:02:19.319 --> 00:02:21.630 
can do it like that the right and so on
so<00:02:20.319> those<00:02:20.770> are<00:02:20.800> some<00:02:20.920> things<00:02:21.160> you<00:02:21.340> can<00:02:21.459> play

00:02:21.630 --> 00:02:21.640 
so those are some things you can play

00:02:21.640 --> 00:02:24.540 
so those are some things you can play
around<00:02:21.760> with<00:02:22.260> the<00:02:23.260> other<00:02:23.290> i<00:02:23.770> would<00:02:24.040> say<00:02:24.220> big

00:02:24.540 --> 00:02:24.550 
around with the other i would say big

00:02:24.550 --> 00:02:27.050 
around with the other i would say big
thing<00:02:24.880> that<00:02:25.200> flash<00:02:26.200> has<00:02:26.470> added<00:02:26.740> here

00:02:27.050 --> 00:02:27.060 
thing that flash has added here

00:02:27.060 --> 00:02:29.690 
thing that flash has added here
is<00:02:27.150> the<00:02:27.840> ability<00:02:28.020> to<00:02:28.470> link<00:02:28.770> text<00:02:29.190> boxes

00:02:29.690 --> 00:02:29.700 
is the ability to link text boxes

00:02:29.700 --> 00:02:32.540 
is the ability to link text boxes
together<00:02:30.080> so<00:02:31.080> I'm<00:02:31.410> simply<00:02:31.920> going<00:02:32.069> to<00:02:32.190> come

00:02:32.540 --> 00:02:32.550 
together so I'm simply going to come

00:02:32.550 --> 00:02:34.880 
together so I'm simply going to come
back<00:02:32.670> here<00:02:33.090> and<00:02:33.180> change<00:02:33.630> this<00:02:33.900> to<00:02:34.230> one<00:02:34.470> column

00:02:34.880 --> 00:02:34.890 
back here and change this to one column

00:02:34.890 --> 00:02:36.890 
back here and change this to one column
so<00:02:35.190> I<00:02:35.220> can<00:02:35.400> demonstrate<00:02:35.550> this<00:02:36.090> and<00:02:36.390> I'm<00:02:36.720> going

00:02:36.890 --> 00:02:36.900 
so I can demonstrate this and I'm going

00:02:36.900 --> 00:02:40.760 
so I can demonstrate this and I'm going
to<00:02:37.319> squish<00:02:37.739> my<00:02:38.040> text<00:02:38.459> box<00:02:38.670> back<00:02:39.209> actually<00:02:40.020> just

00:02:40.760 --> 00:02:40.770 
to squish my text box back actually just

00:02:40.770 --> 00:02:44.210 
to squish my text box back actually just
so<00:02:41.340> it's<00:02:41.489> like<00:02:41.640> this<00:02:42.200> so<00:02:43.200> what<00:02:43.950> I'm<00:02:44.040> going<00:02:44.160> to

00:02:44.210 --> 00:02:44.220 
so it's like this so what I'm going to

00:02:44.220 --> 00:02:46.940 
so it's like this so what I'm going to
do<00:02:44.459> is<00:02:44.730> create<00:02:45.150> another<00:02:45.540> text<00:02:45.959> box<00:02:45.989> by<00:02:46.709> just

00:02:46.940 --> 00:02:46.950 
do is create another text box by just

00:02:46.950 --> 00:02:50.150 
do is create another text box by just
again<00:02:47.489> with<00:02:47.849> the<00:02:47.970> text<00:02:48.269> tool<00:02:48.450> um<00:02:49.160> dragging

00:02:50.150 --> 00:02:50.160

00:02:54.470 --> 00:02:54.480 
like that and now you'll notice when we

00:02:54.480 --> 00:02:57.080 
like that and now you'll notice when we
come<00:02:54.660> to<00:02:54.780> our<00:02:54.900> first<00:02:55.140> text<00:02:55.560> box<00:02:55.590> here<00:02:56.069> that<00:02:56.819> as

00:02:57.080 --> 00:02:57.090 
come to our first text box here that as

00:02:57.090 --> 00:03:00.289 
come to our first text box here that as
I<00:02:57.300> pointed<00:02:58.110> out<00:02:58.170> before<00:02:58.290> it's<00:02:58.860> you<00:02:59.670> can't<00:03:00.030> see

00:03:00.289 --> 00:03:00.299 
I pointed out before it's you can't see

00:03:00.299 --> 00:03:02.750 
I pointed out before it's you can't see
all<00:03:00.450> the<00:03:00.600> texts<00:03:01.080> and<00:03:01.230> this<00:03:01.799> is<00:03:01.950> indicated<00:03:02.610> by

00:03:02.750 --> 00:03:02.760 
all the texts and this is indicated by

00:03:02.760 --> 00:03:06.740 
all the texts and this is indicated by
this<00:03:03.330> little<00:03:03.780> red<00:03:03.989> icon<00:03:04.739> down<00:03:04.950> here<00:03:05.450> so<00:03:06.450> if<00:03:06.720> we

00:03:06.740 --> 00:03:06.750 
this little red icon down here so if we

00:03:06.750 --> 00:03:09.259 
this little red icon down here so if we
click<00:03:07.080> that<00:03:07.350> red<00:03:07.410> icon<00:03:08.069> and<00:03:08.340> then<00:03:08.970> we<00:03:09.060> bring

00:03:09.259 --> 00:03:09.269 
click that red icon and then we bring

00:03:09.269 --> 00:03:11.000 
click that red icon and then we bring
our<00:03:09.360> cursor<00:03:09.690> over<00:03:09.840> here<00:03:10.290> to<00:03:10.440> the<00:03:10.560> other<00:03:10.709> box

00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:11.010 
our cursor over here to the other box

00:03:11.010 --> 00:03:13.640 
our cursor over here to the other box
you'll<00:03:11.819> see<00:03:12.120> that<00:03:12.330> the<00:03:12.720> cursor<00:03:12.989> changes<00:03:13.200> to

00:03:13.640 --> 00:03:13.650 
you'll see that the cursor changes to

00:03:13.650 --> 00:03:16.550 
you'll see that the cursor changes to
almost<00:03:14.040> like<00:03:14.220> a<00:03:14.280> chain<00:03:14.670> link<00:03:14.849> icon<00:03:15.349> this<00:03:16.349> means

00:03:16.550 --> 00:03:16.560 
almost like a chain link icon this means

00:03:16.560 --> 00:03:18.710 
almost like a chain link icon this means
you<00:03:16.680> can<00:03:16.739> link<00:03:17.069> the<00:03:17.280> text<00:03:17.580> together<00:03:17.670> so<00:03:18.569> if<00:03:18.690> we

00:03:18.710 --> 00:03:18.720 
you can link the text together so if we

00:03:18.720 --> 00:03:20.600 
you can link the text together so if we
just<00:03:18.900> go<00:03:19.019> ahead<00:03:19.140> and<00:03:19.290> click<00:03:19.560> that<00:03:19.620> it'll

just go ahead and click that it'll

00:03:20.610 --> 00:03:23.809 
just go ahead and click that it'll
automatically<00:03:21.390> bring<00:03:21.750> the<00:03:22.080> overflow<00:03:22.650> to<00:03:23.580> this

00:03:23.809 --> 00:03:23.819 
automatically bring the overflow to this

00:03:23.819 --> 00:03:26.780 
automatically bring the overflow to this
text<00:03:24.299> box<00:03:24.560> so<00:03:25.560> for<00:03:25.799> instance<00:03:25.860> this<00:03:26.370> is<00:03:26.519> great

00:03:26.780 --> 00:03:26.790 
text box so for instance this is great

00:03:26.790 --> 00:03:28.070 
text box so for instance this is great
let's<00:03:27.120> say<00:03:27.269> we<00:03:27.390> want<00:03:27.569> to<00:03:27.660> add<00:03:27.780> another

00:03:31.250 --> 00:03:31.260 
sentence right here so we can go into

00:03:31.260 --> 00:03:34.400 
sentence right here so we can go into
this<00:03:31.440> text<00:03:31.769> box<00:03:31.950> and<00:03:32.190> type<00:03:32.959> this<00:03:33.959> is<00:03:34.200> really

00:03:46.769 --> 00:03:48.650 
text boxes too because again this one
isn't<00:03:47.280> showing<00:03:47.459> all<00:03:47.730> the<00:03:47.760> texts<00:03:48.180> either<00:03:48.329> so

00:03:48.650 --> 00:03:48.660 
isn't showing all the texts either so

00:03:48.660 --> 00:03:51.110 
isn't showing all the texts either so
you<00:03:48.720> can<00:03:48.900> make<00:03:49.049> either<00:03:49.290> another<00:03:50.280> text<00:03:50.400> box<00:03:50.730> and

00:03:51.110 --> 00:03:51.120 
you can make either another text box and

00:03:51.120 --> 00:03:53.660 
you can make either another text box and
then<00:03:51.600> flow<00:03:51.930> this<00:03:52.079> one<00:03:52.290> over<00:03:52.500> to<00:03:52.620> there<00:03:52.799> and<00:03:53.069> you

00:03:53.660 --> 00:03:53.670 
then flow this one over to there and you

00:03:53.670 --> 00:03:56.240 
then flow this one over to there and you
could<00:03:53.790> do<00:03:54.180> that<00:03:54.299> and<00:03:54.569> so<00:03:54.900> on<00:03:55.109> and<00:03:55.709> this<00:03:56.130> is

00:03:56.240 --> 00:03:56.250 
could do that and so on and this is

00:03:56.250 --> 00:03:57.890 
could do that and so on and this is
great<00:03:56.489> too<00:03:56.730> if<00:03:56.910> you're<00:03:57.090> maybe<00:03:57.359> designing<00:03:57.840> a

00:03:57.890 --> 00:03:57.900 
great too if you're maybe designing a

00:03:57.900 --> 00:04:00.349 
great too if you're maybe designing a
web<00:03:58.079> page<00:03:58.290> and<00:03:59.040> let's<00:03:59.250> say<00:03:59.370> you<00:03:59.430> want<00:03:59.760> to<00:03:59.880> wrap

00:04:00.349 --> 00:04:00.359 
web page and let's say you want to wrap

00:04:00.359 --> 00:04:02.270 
web page and let's say you want to wrap
your<00:04:00.540> text<00:04:00.900> around<00:04:01.230> an<00:04:01.440> image<00:04:01.769> that's<00:04:01.799> in<00:04:02.220> the

00:04:02.270 --> 00:04:02.280 
your text around an image that's in the

00:04:02.280 --> 00:04:04.460 
your text around an image that's in the
center<00:04:02.639> of<00:04:02.670> the<00:04:02.910> web<00:04:03.060> page<00:04:03.269> you<00:04:03.930> could<00:04:04.079> simply

00:04:04.460 --> 00:04:04.470 
center of the web page you could simply

00:04:04.470 --> 00:04:07.069 
center of the web page you could simply
take<00:04:04.500> your<00:04:04.769> text<00:04:05.370> box<00:04:05.579> here<00:04:05.940> move<00:04:06.600> it<00:04:06.720> up<00:04:06.870> and

00:04:07.069 --> 00:04:07.079 
take your text box here move it up and

00:04:07.079 --> 00:04:08.809 
take your text box here move it up and
you<00:04:07.590> could<00:04:07.680> squish<00:04:07.980> it<00:04:08.160> to<00:04:08.280> the<00:04:08.370> dimensions

00:04:08.809 --> 00:04:08.819 
you could squish it to the dimensions

00:04:08.819 --> 00:04:10.520 
you could squish it to the dimensions
you<00:04:08.940> want<00:04:09.209> and<00:04:09.510> then<00:04:10.109> you<00:04:10.139> can<00:04:10.350> have<00:04:10.470> your

00:04:10.520 --> 00:04:10.530 
you want and then you can have your

00:04:10.530 --> 00:04:12.590 
you want and then you can have your
image<00:04:10.980> right<00:04:11.430> there<00:04:11.459> and<00:04:12.120> then<00:04:12.359> maybe<00:04:12.510> another

00:04:12.590 --> 00:04:12.600 
image right there and then maybe another

00:04:12.600 --> 00:04:17.229 
image right there and then maybe another
text<00:04:13.109> box<00:04:13.139> right<00:04:13.739> here<00:04:13.769> and<00:04:14.190> so<00:04:15.000> on<00:04:15.150> like<00:04:15.359> that

00:04:17.229 --> 00:04:17.239 
text box right here and so on like that

00:04:17.239 --> 00:04:19.819 
text box right here and so on like that
anyway<00:04:18.239> there<00:04:18.690> are<00:04:18.810> some<00:04:18.959> other<00:04:19.169> features<00:04:19.530> you

00:04:19.819 --> 00:04:19.829 
anyway there are some other features you

00:04:19.829 --> 00:04:22.009 
anyway there are some other features you
can<00:04:19.859> play<00:04:20.130> around<00:04:20.250> with<00:04:20.549> here<00:04:20.789> too<00:04:21.000> but<00:04:21.810> those

00:04:22.009 --> 00:04:22.019 
can play around with here too but those

00:04:22.019 --> 00:04:24.200 
can play around with here too but those
are<00:04:22.200> the<00:04:22.229> major<00:04:22.470> changes<00:04:23.070> to<00:04:23.130> the<00:04:23.400> new<00:04:23.580> text

00:04:24.200 --> 00:04:24.210
