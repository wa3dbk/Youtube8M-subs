00:03:40.680 --> 00:03:43.190 
just a little edge around this side yeah
just<00:03:40.890> a<00:03:40.980> little<00:03:41.130> bit<00:03:41.340> of<00:03:41.490> an<00:03:41.580> edge<00:03:41.730> I<00:03:42.200> could

00:03:43.190 --> 00:03:43.200 
just a little bit of an edge I could

00:03:43.200 --> 00:03:44.660 
just a little bit of an edge I could
probably<00:03:43.380> even<00:03:43.530> put<00:03:43.770> a<00:03:43.800> little<00:03:44.100> bit<00:03:44.220> more<00:03:44.430> here

00:03:44.660 --> 00:03:44.670 
probably even put a little bit more here

00:03:44.670 --> 00:03:46.940 
probably even put a little bit more here
but<00:03:44.850> you<00:03:44.970> got<00:03:45.150> all<00:03:45.450> right<00:03:45.709> awesome

00:03:46.940 --> 00:03:46.950 
but you got all right awesome

00:03:46.950 --> 00:03:48.590 
but you got all right awesome
so<00:03:47.190> once<00:03:47.340> you<00:03:47.459> have<00:03:47.550> that<00:03:47.700> all<00:03:47.880> spread<00:03:48.270> out<00:03:48.420> you

00:03:48.590 --> 00:03:48.600 
so once you have that all spread out you

00:03:48.600 --> 00:03:49.880 
so once you have that all spread out you
can<00:03:48.720> start<00:03:48.959> rolling<00:03:49.080> it<00:03:49.380> up<00:03:49.500> and<00:03:49.680> you're<00:03:49.800> gonna

00:03:49.880 --> 00:03:49.890 
can start rolling it up and you're gonna

00:03:49.890 --> 00:03:51.890 
can start rolling it up and you're gonna
start<00:03:50.220> with<00:03:50.340> the<00:03:50.520> long<00:03:50.730> side<00:03:51.150> and<00:03:51.480> bring<00:03:51.750> it

00:03:51.890 --> 00:03:51.900 
start with the long side and bring it

00:03:51.900 --> 00:03:55.340 
start with the long side and bring it
forward<00:03:52.160> so<00:03:53.360> it's<00:03:54.360> gonna<00:03:54.450> go<00:03:54.630> like<00:03:54.780> this<00:03:55.020> about

00:03:55.340 --> 00:03:55.350 
forward so it's gonna go like this about

00:03:55.350 --> 00:04:00.170 
forward so it's gonna go like this about
an<00:03:55.500> inch<00:03:55.680> in<00:03:55.920> and<00:03:56.930> then<00:03:57.930> repeat<00:03:58.880> and<00:03:59.880> just<00:04:00.090> go

00:04:00.170 --> 00:04:00.180 
an inch in and then repeat and just go

00:04:00.180 --> 00:04:01.460 
an inch in and then repeat and just go
all<00:04:00.450> the<00:04:00.690> way<00:04:00.720> through<00:04:00.989> until<00:04:01.290> you<00:04:01.319> have<00:04:01.440> a
