the way of the future most everything is
converting<00:01:35.369> the<00:01:35.460> high<00:01:35.579> definition<00:01:36.240> now<00:01:36.420> and

00:01:36.679 --> 00:01:36.689 
converting the high definition now and

00:01:36.689 --> 00:01:39.140 
converting the high definition now and
you<00:01:37.560> might<00:01:37.710> even<00:01:37.740> find<00:01:38.130> it<00:01:38.369> hard<00:01:38.729> to<00:01:38.820> find<00:01:38.880> a

00:01:43.700 --> 00:01:43.710 
shoot in high definition you can convert

00:01:43.710 --> 00:01:45.889 
shoot in high definition you can convert
down<00:01:44.009> the<00:01:44.250> standard<00:01:44.610> definition<00:01:45.149> but<00:01:45.659> you

00:01:45.889 --> 00:01:45.899 
down the standard definition but you

00:01:45.899 --> 00:01:47.300 
down the standard definition but you
can't<00:01:46.140> take<00:01:46.290> standard<00:01:46.710> definition<00:01:47.159> and

00:01:47.300 --> 00:01:47.310 
can't take standard definition and

00:01:47.310 --> 00:01:49.969 
can't take standard definition and
convert<00:01:47.549> it<00:01:47.579> up<00:01:47.790> to<00:01:47.939> high<00:01:48.060> definition<00:01:48.659> a<00:01:49.380> one

00:01:49.969 --> 00:01:49.979 
convert it up to high definition a one

00:01:49.979 --> 00:01:51.499 
convert it up to high definition a one
