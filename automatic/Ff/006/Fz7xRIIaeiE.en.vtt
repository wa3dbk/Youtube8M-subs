00:02:38.430 --> 00:02:38.440 
the adenosine Lieberman is what I made

00:02:38.440 --> 00:02:43.500 
the adenosine Lieberman is what I made

00:04:41.040 --> 00:04:41.050 
when you think you cracked it you

00:04:41.050 --> 00:04:56.090 
when you think you cracked it you
haven't

00:04:56.090 --> 00:04:56.100 

00:04:56.100 --> 00:04:58.130 

Oh
