 So one of the biggest concerns with vinyl air bubbles is wrinkles. These two things 

00:01:09.679 --> 00:01:13.679
 It can usually turn something that looks stylish to something that looks dirty. Luckily 

00:01:13.679 --> 00:01:18.240
 The vinyl in this kit has air release technology so it actually has miniature air channels 

00:01:18.240 --> 00:01:22.600
 On the adhesive side which allows air to be easily removed from under the vinyl,

00:02:01.990 --> 00:02:02.249
