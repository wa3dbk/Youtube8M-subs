modnation racers so that was a pretty
good<00:00:39.500> game<00:00:39.829> I<00:00:40.100> remember<00:00:40.790> playing<00:00:40.909> that<00:00:41.120> Allah

00:00:41.590 --> 00:00:41.600

00:00:44.049 --> 00:00:44.059 
it was actually a pretty fun game except

00:00:44.059 --> 00:00:45.939 
it was actually a pretty fun game except
I<00:00:44.269> ended<00:00:44.600> up<00:00:44.690> selling<00:00:44.960> yeah<00:00:45.260> because<00:00:45.559> of<00:00:45.769> the

00:00:45.939 --> 00:00:45.949 
I ended up selling yeah because of the

00:00:45.949 --> 00:00:48.009 
I ended up selling yeah because of the
loading<00:00:46.309> times<00:00:46.519> I<00:00:46.670> really<00:00:46.820> hated<00:00:47.149> that<00:00:47.390> so<00:00:47.989> I

00:00:48.009 --> 00:00:48.019 
loading times I really hated that so I

00:00:48.019 --> 00:00:49.630 
loading times I really hated that so I
just<00:00:48.409> I<00:00:48.680> couldn't<00:00:48.890> stand<00:00:49.100> the<00:00:49.220> loading<00:00:49.489> times

00:00:49.630 --> 00:00:49.640 
just I couldn't stand the loading times

00:00:49.640 --> 00:00:52.060 
just I couldn't stand the loading times
actually<00:00:49.879> so<00:00:50.600> that's<00:00:50.780> I<00:00:51.110> guess<00:00:51.409> that<00:00:51.860> played<00:00:52.040> a

00:00:52.060 --> 00:00:52.070 
actually so that's I guess that played a

00:00:52.070 --> 00:00:54.130 
actually so that's I guess that played a
big<00:00:52.159> role<00:00:52.309> in<00:00:52.519> why<00:00:52.790> I<00:00:52.820> started<00:00:53.329> decided<00:00:54.050> to

00:00:54.130 --> 00:00:54.140 
big role in why I started decided to

00:00:54.140 --> 00:00:57.399 
big role in why I started decided to
sell<00:00:54.320> that<00:00:54.559> money<00:00:54.860> racers<00:00:55.460> but<00:00:56.150> anyways<00:00:56.479> from

little big planet to most of them will

00:02:59.150 --> 00:03:01.090 
little big planet to most of them will
be<00:02:59.330> in<00:02:59.630> this<00:02:59.900> for<00:03:00.230> example<00:03:00.590> the<00:03:00.680> grappling

karting<00:03:04.040> so<00:03:04.489> that<00:03:04.640> is<00:03:04.790> kind<00:03:04.970> of<00:03:05.120> weird<00:03:05.330> because

00:03:05.470 --> 00:03:05.480 
karting so that is kind of weird because

00:03:05.480 --> 00:03:07.030 
karting so that is kind of weird because
how<00:03:05.780> are<00:03:05.840> you<00:03:05.930> gonna<00:03:06.080> use<00:03:06.380> it<00:03:06.410> when<00:03:06.650> you're<00:03:06.800> not

00:03:07.030 --> 00:03:07.040

raise your stuff cat pee because it's a

00:04:55.139 --> 00:04:56.300 
raise your stuff cat pee because it's a
new<00:04:55.320> engine<00:04:55.530> so<00:04:55.860> it's<00:04:56.010> not<00:04:56.130> like<00:04:56.280> a

00:04:56.300 --> 00:04:56.310 
new engine so it's not like a

00:04:56.310 --> 00:04:57.950 
new engine so it's not like a
downloadable<00:04:56.880> game<00:04:57.090> it's<00:04:57.270> a<00:04:57.330> full<00:04:57.570> retail

00:04:57.950 --> 00:04:57.960
