00:05:03.029 --> 00:05:03.039 
the biggest utterances we've ever had in

00:05:03.039 --> 00:05:05.550 
the biggest utterances we've ever had in

00:05:11.890 --> 00:05:14.219 
appear to be very ordered and reserved
so<00:05:12.820> there<00:05:13.060> was<00:05:13.180> a<00:05:13.210> complete<00:05:13.510> contradiction

00:05:14.219 --> 00:05:14.229 
so there was a complete contradiction

00:05:14.229 --> 00:05:17.460

there<00:05:14.590> between<00:05:15.430> the<00:05:16.390> man<00:05:16.600> as<00:05:16.810> we<00:05:16.990> might<00:05:17.169> see

00:05:17.460 --> 00:05:17.470 
there between the man as we might see

00:05:17.470 --> 00:05:20.210 
there between the man as we might see
him<00:05:17.710> and<00:05:17.919> the<00:05:18.490> man<00:05:18.669> as<00:05:18.880> he<00:05:19.060> expressed<00:05:19.539> himself

00:05:20.210 --> 00:05:20.220 
him and the man as he expressed himself

00:05:20.220 --> 00:05:28.959 
him and the man as he expressed himself
artistically
