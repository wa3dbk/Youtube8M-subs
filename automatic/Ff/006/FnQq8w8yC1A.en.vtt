00:00:02.360 --> 00:00:03.710
 ever 

00:00:03.710 --> 00:00:09.210
 in heaven there was an angel working the earth and his life and going down and up and 

00:00:09.210 --> 00:00:12.879
 he had to run a lot very much this year because he had not placed 

00:00:12.879 --> 00:00:17.910
 the great mission of his life all the relief corporations that would have 

00:00:17.910 --> 00:00:22.490
 part of the men for it and Assyrians can get it out of their problem but 

00:00:22.489 --> 00:00:24.560
 it turns out that very fatigued this year 

00:00:24.560 --> 00:00:29.349
 Suddenly he ran away and stayed so donors that these roads were at 

00:00:29.349 --> 00:00:33.089
 over in the cloud as responsible sunbathing against 

00:00:33.900 --> 00:00:37.200
 thanks to him he is married and others who have placed a mission 

00:00:37.970 --> 00:00:42.950
 He told me clearly that yes, the ambition of Pérez Gil Díaz Pérez did not work. 

00:00:42.950 --> 00:00:45.810
 the gratitude populations of men 

00:00:45.810 --> 00:00:47.810
 yesterday once 

00:00:47.810 --> 00:00:52.700
 I have solved the problem but it is not that men are very ungrateful 

00:00:52.700 --> 00:00:53.340
 two 

00:00:53.340 --> 00:00:55.690
 there is no that there is no work 

00:00:55.690 --> 00:01:00.310
 let us remember that the gospel of lucas mundo is that jesús sometime 

00:01:00.310 --> 00:01:05.920
 won albiac three processes the days received the miracle but two days 

00:01:05.920 --> 00:01:08.230
 only one was returned 

00:01:08.230 --> 00:01:13.980
 praise thanks zone 1 prostrated before him and god 

00:01:15.040 --> 00:01:20.790
 that's why what we tread the geology of him the firefighters that we only ask 

00:01:20.790 --> 00:01:25.780
 Augustin lips when we have a big problem when there is a big fire 

00:01:25.780 --> 00:01:28.490
 but once 

00:01:28.490 --> 00:01:30.940
 It takes us out of the filthy 

00:01:30.940 --> 00:01:35.020
 does the miracle take us out of the problem we do not even recognize 

00:01:35.020 --> 00:01:36.970
 it was the fact that no 

00:01:36.970 --> 00:01:43.470
 jacobo of this great problem we do not even return to thank you very much 

00:01:43.470 --> 00:01:48.290
 least we do not return to surrender from our hearts glory to 

00:01:48.290 --> 00:01:52.710
 to engage with him that's why let's remember these days the processes 

00:01:54.090 --> 00:01:58.320
 the grateful only the one who returned and surrendered his life Jesus 

00:01:59.240 --> 00:02:00.540
 who received 

00:02:00.540 --> 00:02:01.469
 the eternal salvation
