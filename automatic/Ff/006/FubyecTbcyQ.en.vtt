really<00:03:02.820> appliable<00:03:03.150> to<00:03:03.450> the<00:03:03.540> drum<00:03:03.750> kit<00:03:03.989> and<00:03:04.110> you

00:03:04.580 --> 00:03:04.590 
really appliable to the drum kit and you

00:03:04.590 --> 00:03:06.259 
really appliable to the drum kit and you
can<00:03:04.769> move<00:03:04.920> around<00:03:05.160> the<00:03:05.340> exits<00:03:05.760> to<00:03:05.850> create

00:03:06.259 --> 00:03:06.269 
can move around the exits to create

00:03:06.269 --> 00:03:07.820 
can move around the exits to create
different<00:03:06.510> sounding<00:03:07.049> beats<00:03:07.260> without<00:03:07.650> ever

00:03:07.820 --> 00:03:07.830 
different sounding beats without ever

00:03:07.830 --> 00:03:09.620 
different sounding beats without ever
changing<00:03:07.920> your<00:03:08.430> sticking<00:03:08.730> pattern<00:03:09.209> which<00:03:09.600> is

00:03:09.620 --> 00:03:09.630 
changing your sticking pattern which is

00:03:09.630 --> 00:03:12.789 
changing your sticking pattern which is
really<00:03:10.200> cool<00:03:10.410> so<00:03:10.739> check<00:03:10.769> that<00:03:11.250> out<00:03:11.459> now<00:03:12.360> I

00:03:12.789 --> 00:03:12.799 
really cool so check that out now I

00:03:12.799 --> 00:03:15.920 
really cool so check that out now I
wanted<00:03:13.799> to<00:03:14.010> apply<00:03:14.310> the<00:03:14.370> Jojo<00:03:14.910> Mayer<00:03:15.180> foot

00:03:15.920 --> 00:03:15.930 
wanted to apply the Jojo Mayer foot

00:03:15.930 --> 00:03:20.330 
wanted to apply the Jojo Mayer foot
technique<00:03:16.170> I<00:03:18.200> wanted<00:03:19.200> to<00:03:19.350> apply<00:03:19.799> them<00:03:20.070> to

00:03:20.330 --> 00:03:20.340 
technique I wanted to apply them to

00:03:20.340 --> 00:03:25.699 
technique I wanted to apply them to
something<00:03:20.970> that<00:03:21.180> was<00:03:22.170> difficult<00:03:22.670> that<00:03:23.750> I<00:03:24.750> felt

00:03:25.699 --> 00:03:25.709 
something that was difficult that I felt

00:03:25.709 --> 00:03:27.920 
something that was difficult that I felt
like<00:03:25.769> it<00:03:25.860> would<00:03:26.070> be<00:03:26.100> cool<00:03:27.060> when<00:03:27.360> it<00:03:27.480> was<00:03:27.630> done

00:03:27.920 --> 00:03:27.930 
like it would be cool when it was done

00:03:27.930 --> 00:03:31.520 
like it would be cool when it was done
and<00:03:28.260> it<00:03:28.739> would<00:03:28.829> give<00:03:29.040> me<00:03:29.250> a<00:03:30.350> balance<00:03:31.350> between

00:03:31.520 --> 00:03:31.530 
and it would give me a balance between

00:03:31.530 --> 00:03:36.170 
and it would give me a balance between
some<00:03:32.100> some<00:03:32.820> beats<00:03:33.390> that<00:03:33.780> were<00:03:33.959> playing<00:03:35.180> heel

00:03:36.170 --> 00:03:36.180 
some some beats that were playing heel

00:03:36.180 --> 00:03:38.569 
some some beats that were playing heel
up<00:03:36.510> which<00:03:36.840> is<00:03:36.989> a<00:03:37.019> normal<00:03:37.410> way<00:03:37.530> I<00:03:37.560> play<00:03:37.889> to

00:03:38.569 --> 00:03:38.579 
up which is a normal way I play to

00:03:38.579 --> 00:03:39.680 
up which is a normal way I play to
dropping<00:03:38.910> my<00:03:39.239> foot

00:03:39.680 --> 00:03:39.690 
dropping my foot

00:03:39.690 --> 00:03:42.200 
dropping my foot
and<00:03:39.780> doing<00:03:40.440> the<00:03:40.650> Jojo<00:03:41.040> Mayer<00:03:41.220> technique<00:03:41.670> this

00:03:42.200 --> 00:03:42.210 
and doing the Jojo Mayer technique this

00:03:42.210 --> 00:03:43.790 
and doing the Jojo Mayer technique this
groove<00:03:42.510> worked<00:03:42.780> great<00:03:43.140> for<00:03:43.170> all<00:03:43.560> of<00:03:43.680> those

00:03:43.790 --> 00:03:43.800 
groove worked great for all of those

00:03:43.800 --> 00:03:44.990 
groove worked great for all of those
things<00:03:43.980> it's<00:03:44.190> a<00:03:44.250> great<00:03:44.430> independence

00:03:44.990 --> 00:03:45.000 
things it's a great independence

00:03:45.000 --> 00:03:46.610 
things it's a great independence
exercise<00:03:45.450> gives<00:03:45.810> you<00:03:45.870> a<00:03:45.900> really<00:03:46.170> cool<00:03:46.320> groove

00:03:46.610 --> 00:03:46.620 
exercise gives you a really cool groove

00:03:46.620 --> 00:03:48.320 
exercise gives you a really cool groove
when<00:03:46.800> you're<00:03:46.920> done<00:03:47.040> and<00:03:47.310> it<00:03:47.700> swaps<00:03:48.000> you<00:03:48.150> back

00:03:48.320 --> 00:03:48.330 
when you're done and it swaps you back

00:03:48.330 --> 00:03:52.430 
when you're done and it swaps you back
and<00:03:48.540> forth<00:03:48.570> between<00:03:48.920> heel<00:03:49.920> up<00:03:50.220> and<00:03:50.790> and<00:03:51.440> Jojo

00:03:52.430 --> 00:03:52.440 
and forth between heel up and and Jojo

00:03:52.440 --> 00:03:55.940 
and forth between heel up and and Jojo
Mayer<00:03:52.650> technique<00:03:53.180> so<00:03:54.290> in<00:03:55.290> the<00:03:55.470> end<00:03:55.620> it<00:03:55.920> should

00:03:55.940 --> 00:03:55.950 
Mayer technique so in the end it should

00:03:55.950 --> 00:03:57.620 
Mayer technique so in the end it should
sound<00:03:56.280> pretty<00:03:56.400> groovy<00:03:56.820> I<00:03:57.030> like<00:03:57.240> to<00:03:57.330> play<00:03:57.510> it

00:03:57.620 --> 00:03:57.630 
sound pretty groovy I like to play it

00:03:57.630 --> 00:04:00.020 
sound pretty groovy I like to play it
slower<00:03:57.990> rather<00:03:58.440> than<00:03:58.650> faster<00:03:59.100> so<00:03:59.640> you<00:03:59.670> get<00:04:00.000> a

00:04:00.020 --> 00:04:00.030 
slower rather than faster so you get a

00:04:00.030 --> 00:04:08.030 
slower rather than faster so you get a
do<00:04:00.960> got<00:04:01.350> got<00:04:01.860> you<00:04:06.050> so<00:04:07.050> give<00:04:07.920> you<00:04:08.010> a

00:04:08.030 --> 00:04:08.040 
do got got you so give you a

00:04:08.040 --> 00:04:39.800 
do got got you so give you a
demonstration<00:04:08.280> of<00:04:08.820> that<00:04:38.270> that's<00:04:39.270> taking<00:04:39.780> the

00:04:39.800 --> 00:04:39.810 
demonstration of that that's taking the

00:04:39.810 --> 00:04:43.370 
demonstration of that that's taking the
right<00:04:40.230> right<00:04:40.740> right<00:04:40.890> right<00:04:42.050> that's<00:04:43.050> where<00:04:43.350> I

00:04:43.370 --> 00:04:43.380 
right right right right that's where I

00:04:43.380 --> 00:04:45.080 
right right right right that's where I
put<00:04:43.680> that<00:04:43.740> start<00:04:44.250> to<00:04:44.310> put<00:04:44.490> that<00:04:44.610> pattern<00:04:44.970> in

00:04:45.080 --> 00:04:45.090 
put that start to put that pattern in

00:04:45.090 --> 00:04:48.530 
put that start to put that pattern in
sometimes<00:04:45.510> a<00:04:45.600> little<00:04:45.750> earlier<00:04:46.169> but<00:04:47.360> you<00:04:48.360> can

00:04:48.530 --> 00:04:48.540 
sometimes a little earlier but you can

00:04:48.540 --> 00:05:05.720 
sometimes a little earlier but you can
do<00:04:49.470> Jo<00:04:49.680> goes<00:04:49.950> better<00:05:03.500> so<00:05:04.500> gives<00:05:05.190> you<00:05:05.310> a<00:05:05.370> really

00:05:05.720 --> 00:05:05.730 
do Jo goes better so gives you a really

00:05:05.730 --> 00:05:07.280 
do Jo goes better so gives you a really
kind<00:05:05.910> of<00:05:06.030> slinky<00:05:06.360> groove<00:05:06.750> if<00:05:06.930> you<00:05:07.050> slow<00:05:07.260> it

00:05:07.280 --> 00:05:07.290 
kind of slinky groove if you slow it

00:05:07.290 --> 00:05:09.200 
kind of slinky groove if you slow it
down<00:05:07.440> I<00:05:07.590> started<00:05:08.040> it<00:05:08.160> out<00:05:08.250> faster<00:05:08.790> because

00:05:09.200 --> 00:05:09.210 
down I started it out faster because

00:05:09.210 --> 00:05:11.000 
down I started it out faster because
it's<00:05:09.360> just<00:05:09.540> it's<00:05:09.990> kind<00:05:10.230> of<00:05:10.320> hard<00:05:10.620> for<00:05:10.710> me<00:05:10.919> to

00:05:11.000 --> 00:05:11.010 
it's just it's kind of hard for me to

00:05:11.010 --> 00:05:12.590 
it's just it's kind of hard for me to
get<00:05:11.160> it<00:05:11.280> to<00:05:11.520> go<00:05:11.640> really<00:05:12.060> slow<00:05:12.270> at<00:05:12.510> the

00:05:12.590 --> 00:05:12.600 
get it to go really slow at the

00:05:12.600 --> 00:05:14.590 
get it to go really slow at the
beginning<00:05:12.690> I'm<00:05:13.080> still<00:05:13.290> working<00:05:13.590> on<00:05:13.710> that<00:05:13.890> but

00:05:14.590 --> 00:05:14.600 
beginning I'm still working on that but

00:05:14.600 --> 00:05:17.930 
beginning I'm still working on that but
slower<00:05:15.600> is<00:05:15.960> where<00:05:16.140> it<00:05:16.290> really<00:05:16.590> seems<00:05:16.919> to<00:05:17.280> take

00:05:17.930 --> 00:05:17.940 
slower is where it really seems to take

00:05:17.940 --> 00:05:19.880 
slower is where it really seems to take
on<00:05:18.180> its<00:05:18.419> own<00:05:18.570> instead<00:05:18.900> of<00:05:19.080> being<00:05:19.260> just<00:05:19.500> kind<00:05:19.680> of

00:05:19.880 --> 00:05:19.890 
on its own instead of being just kind of

00:05:19.890 --> 00:05:22.850 
on its own instead of being just kind of
a<00:05:19.919> funky<00:05:20.850> pattern<00:05:21.180> it<00:05:21.480> takes<00:05:21.720> on<00:05:21.930> some<00:05:22.260> some

00:05:22.850 --> 00:05:22.860 
a funky pattern it takes on some some

00:05:22.860 --> 00:05:39.540 
a funky pattern it takes on some some
grooviness

00:05:39.540 --> 00:05:39.550 

00:05:39.550 --> 00:05:41.860

what<00:05:47.120> it<00:05:47.240> sounds<00:05:47.510> cool<00:05:47.780> so<00:05:48.380> as<00:05:48.530> I<00:05:48.680> said<00:05:48.949> the

00:05:49.600 --> 00:05:49.610 
what it sounds cool so as I said the

00:05:49.610 --> 00:05:54.610 
what it sounds cool so as I said the
beat<00:05:50.060> on<00:05:50.090> the<00:05:50.360> foot<00:05:50.630> you<00:05:50.930> get<00:05:51.699> you<00:05:52.699> get<00:05:53.620> singles

00:05:54.610 --> 00:05:54.620 
beat on the foot you get you get singles

00:05:54.620 --> 00:05:58.300 
beat on the foot you get you get singles
with<00:05:55.100> I<00:05:55.430> played<00:05:56.260> heel<00:05:57.260> up<00:05:57.500> and<00:05:57.650> then<00:05:58.010> you<00:05:58.160> go<00:05:58.280> to

00:05:58.300 --> 00:05:58.310 
with I played heel up and then you go to

00:05:58.310 --> 00:06:11.170 
with I played heel up and then you go to
the<00:05:58.550> dojo<00:05:58.729> mirror<00:05:59.060> technique<00:05:59.419> so<00:05:59.600> you<00:05:59.690> get<00:06:10.180> so

00:06:11.170 --> 00:06:11.180 
the dojo mirror technique so you get so

00:06:11.180 --> 00:06:13.210 
the dojo mirror technique so you get so
you<00:06:11.240> get<00:06:11.449> a<00:06:11.479> nice<00:06:12.080> variation<00:06:12.560> there<00:06:13.010> that

00:06:13.210 --> 00:06:13.220 
you get a nice variation there that

00:06:13.220 --> 00:06:14.980 
you get a nice variation there that

00:06:14.980 --> 00:06:14.990 
teaches you how to go back and forth and

00:06:14.990 --> 00:06:16.600 
teaches you how to go back and forth and
gives<00:06:15.380> you<00:06:15.530> a<00:06:15.560> groove<00:06:15.830> you<00:06:15.979> concentrate<00:06:16.460> on

00:06:16.600 --> 00:06:16.610 
gives you a groove you concentrate on

00:06:16.610 --> 00:06:19.000 
gives you a groove you concentrate on
when<00:06:17.570> you're<00:06:17.720> doing<00:06:18.020> the<00:06:18.199> right<00:06:18.500> right<00:06:18.770> left

00:06:19.000 --> 00:06:19.010 
when you're doing the right right left

00:06:19.010 --> 00:06:21.189 
when you're doing the right right left
right<00:06:19.190> right<00:06:19.310> left<00:06:19.550> right<00:06:19.910> left<00:06:20.030> some<00:06:20.840> of<00:06:20.990> your

00:06:21.189 --> 00:06:21.199 
right right left right left some of your

00:06:21.199 --> 00:06:23.710 
right right left right left some of your
down<00:06:21.680> beats<00:06:22.010> occur<00:06:22.370> with<00:06:22.639> your<00:06:22.910> when<00:06:23.449> you're

00:06:23.710 --> 00:06:23.720 
down beats occur with your when you're

00:06:23.720 --> 00:06:26.159 
down beats occur with your when you're
going<00:06:24.530> on<00:06:24.680> the<00:06:24.830> upbeat<00:06:25.250> with<00:06:25.460> your<00:06:25.610> foot<00:06:25.880> and

going on the upbeat with your foot and
vice<00:06:27.169> versa<00:06:27.500> so<00:06:27.919> sometimes<00:06:28.820> you're<00:06:29.720> feeling<00:06:30.110> a

00:06:30.159 --> 00:06:30.169 
vice versa so sometimes you're feeling a

00:06:30.169 --> 00:06:33.070 
vice versa so sometimes you're feeling a
little<00:06:30.320> out<00:06:30.650> of<00:06:30.680> sorts<00:06:30.800> and<00:06:31.510> with<00:06:32.510> everything

00:06:33.070 --> 00:06:33.080 
little out of sorts and with everything

00:06:33.080 --> 00:06:34.960 
little out of sorts and with everything
going<00:06:33.350> at<00:06:33.470> ruff<00:06:33.650> once<00:06:33.889> it<00:06:34.100> kind<00:06:34.310> of<00:06:34.400> kind<00:06:34.910> of

00:06:34.960 --> 00:06:34.970 
going at ruff once it kind of kind of

00:06:34.970 --> 00:06:36.430 
going at ruff once it kind of kind of
throws<00:06:35.300> you<00:06:35.419> off<00:06:35.539> kilter<00:06:35.810> a<00:06:35.930> little<00:06:36.169> bit<00:06:36.289> which

throws you off kilter a little bit which

00:06:36.440 --> 00:06:39.339 
throws you off kilter a little bit which
is<00:06:36.590> really<00:06:36.950> good<00:06:37.130> to<00:06:37.720> unground<00:06:38.720> you<00:06:38.960> from<00:06:39.200> the

chair so again check out the Stanmore
stuff<00:06:45.789> break<00:06:46.789> the<00:06:47.000> pattern<00:06:47.389> down<00:06:47.570> to<00:06:47.900> what's

00:06:48.100 --> 00:06:48.110 
stuff break the pattern down to what's

00:06:48.110 --> 00:06:53.110 
stuff break the pattern down to what's
on<00:06:48.260> the<00:06:48.410> bottom<00:06:49.000> really<00:06:50.000> learn<00:06:50.180> that<00:06:52.030> break<00:06:53.030> it

00:06:53.110 --> 00:06:53.120 
on the bottom really learn that break it

00:06:53.120 --> 00:07:03.460 
on the bottom really learn that break it
down<00:06:53.240> to<00:06:53.419> what's<00:06:53.599> on<00:06:53.720> the<00:06:53.810> top<00:07:01.449> and<00:07:02.449> then<00:07:03.169> quit

00:07:03.460 --> 00:07:03.470 
down to what's on the top and then quit

00:07:03.470 --> 00:07:07.659 
down to what's on the top and then quit
in<00:07:03.560> the<00:07:03.680> Jojo<00:07:04.039> Mayer<00:07:04.280> technique<00:07:06.400> when<00:07:07.400> you<00:07:07.430> get

00:07:07.659 --> 00:07:07.669 
in the Jojo Mayer technique when you get

00:07:07.669 --> 00:07:09.820 
in the Jojo Mayer technique when you get
that<00:07:07.789> all<00:07:08.000> done<00:07:08.510> so<00:07:08.780> it<00:07:08.900> gives<00:07:09.080> there's<00:07:09.440> a<00:07:09.500> lot
