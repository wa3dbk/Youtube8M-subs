locks and these cases actually a result
of<00:00:29.010> when<00:00:29.189> we<00:00:29.340> first<00:00:29.910> introduced<00:00:30.359> two<00:00:30.570> years

00:00:30.589 --> 00:00:30.599 
of when we first introduced two years

00:00:30.599 --> 00:00:32.720 
of when we first introduced two years
ago<00:00:31.050> at<00:00:31.170> NAMM<00:00:31.380> we<00:00:31.830> introduced<00:00:32.160> the<00:00:32.309> electric

00:00:32.720 --> 00:00:32.730 
ago at NAMM we introduced the electric

00:00:32.730 --> 00:00:35.660 
ago at NAMM we introduced the electric
guitars<00:00:33.059> flight<00:00:33.540> cases<00:00:33.809> and<00:00:34.380> as<00:00:35.160> soon<00:00:35.430> as<00:00:35.520> we

00:00:35.660 --> 00:00:35.670 
guitars flight cases and as soon as we

00:00:35.670 --> 00:00:37.010 
guitars flight cases and as soon as we
introduced<00:00:36.000> some<00:00:36.180> two<00:00:36.300> years<00:00:36.329> ago<00:00:36.719> the<00:00:36.899> first

introduced some two years ago the first
thing<00:00:37.260> ever<00:00:37.380> I<00:00:37.469> said<00:00:37.649> well<00:00:37.800> what<00:00:38.010> about

00:00:38.030 --> 00:00:38.040 
thing ever I said well what about

00:00:38.040 --> 00:00:40.069 
thing ever I said well what about
acoustics<00:00:38.700> and<00:00:39.149> in<00:00:39.570> order<00:00:39.719> to<00:00:39.809> make<00:00:39.960> these

00:00:40.069 --> 00:00:40.079 
acoustics and in order to make these

00:00:40.079 --> 00:00:41.510 
acoustics and in order to make these
cases<00:00:40.320> you<00:00:40.559> have<00:00:40.680> to<00:00:40.770> have<00:00:40.860> a<00:00:40.890> big<00:00:41.070> enough<00:00:41.160> mold

00:00:41.510 --> 00:00:41.520 
cases you have to have a big enough mold

00:00:41.520 --> 00:00:43.850 
cases you have to have a big enough mold
to<00:00:41.790> make<00:00:41.940> this<00:00:42.090> you<00:00:42.510> know<00:00:42.600> big<00:00:42.750> size<00:00:43.350> case<00:00:43.649> for

00:00:43.850 --> 00:00:43.860 
to make this you know big size case for

00:00:43.860 --> 00:00:46.190 
to make this you know big size case for
acoustics<00:00:44.309> and<00:00:44.489> we<00:00:44.910> finally<00:00:45.300> have<00:00:45.539> it<00:00:45.570> and<00:00:45.870> now

00:00:46.190 --> 00:00:46.200 
acoustics and we finally have it and now

00:00:46.200 --> 00:00:48.740 
acoustics and we finally have it and now
everybody<00:00:46.680> is<00:00:46.739> really<00:00:46.890> excited<00:00:47.039> we<00:00:47.940> have<00:00:48.149> two

everybody is really excited we have two
different<00:00:48.899> styles<00:00:49.170> right<00:00:49.469> now<00:00:49.680> we<00:00:49.739> have

00:00:50.229 --> 00:00:50.239 
different styles right now we have

00:00:50.239 --> 00:00:53.060 
different styles right now we have
dreadknot<00:00:51.239> and<00:00:51.539> we<00:00:51.660> have<00:00:51.809> classical<00:00:52.410> but

00:00:53.060 --> 00:00:53.070 
dreadknot and we have classical but

00:00:53.070 --> 00:00:54.799 
dreadknot and we have classical but
we're<00:00:53.190> working<00:00:53.489> on<00:00:53.579> some<00:00:53.760> more<00:00:53.879> sizes<00:00:54.449> parlour

00:00:54.799 --> 00:00:54.809 
we're working on some more sizes parlour

00:00:54.809 --> 00:00:56.689 
we're working on some more sizes parlour
sizes<00:00:55.289> triple<00:00:55.739> lot<00:00:55.860> you<00:00:56.160> know<00:00:56.250> those<00:00:56.399> kind<00:00:56.670> of

00:00:56.689 --> 00:00:56.699 
sizes triple lot you know those kind of

00:00:56.699 --> 00:00:58.549 
sizes triple lot you know those kind of
things<00:00:56.789> and<00:00:57.239> then<00:00:57.719> we're<00:00:57.840> also<00:00:57.989> looking<00:00:58.170> at

00:00:58.549 --> 00:00:58.559 
things and then we're also looking at

00:00:58.559 --> 00:01:00.380 
things and then we're also looking at
maybe<00:00:58.829> doing<00:00:58.920> a<00:00:59.340> double<00:00:59.730> electric<00:01:00.180> case

00:01:00.380 --> 00:01:00.390 
maybe doing a double electric case

00:01:00.390 --> 00:01:01.970 
maybe doing a double electric case
because<00:01:00.989> there's<00:01:01.170> a<00:01:01.199> lot<00:01:01.350> of<00:01:01.440> musicians<00:01:01.829> out

00:01:01.970 --> 00:01:01.980 
because there's a lot of musicians out

00:01:01.980 --> 00:01:03.319 
because there's a lot of musicians out
there<00:01:02.190> they're<00:01:02.399> traveling<00:01:02.879> with<00:01:02.969> more<00:01:03.090> one

00:01:03.319 --> 00:01:03.329 
there they're traveling with more one

00:01:03.329 --> 00:01:05.090 
there they're traveling with more one
guitar<00:01:03.449> and<00:01:03.960> the<00:01:04.229> stand<00:01:04.439> of<00:01:04.559> the<00:01:04.619> weight<00:01:04.769> limit

00:01:05.090 --> 00:01:05.100 
guitar and the stand of the weight limit

00:01:05.100 --> 00:01:06.230 
guitar and the stand of the weight limit
what<00:01:05.369> they're<00:01:05.519> gonna<00:01:05.640> do<00:01:05.909> is<00:01:06.060> they're<00:01:06.090> gonna

00:01:06.230 --> 00:01:06.240 
what they're gonna do is they're gonna

00:01:06.240 --> 00:01:07.880 
what they're gonna do is they're gonna
get<00:01:06.450> these<00:01:06.600> cases<00:01:06.840> with<00:01:07.229> you<00:01:07.619> know<00:01:07.710> four

00:01:07.880 --> 00:01:07.890 
get these cases with you know four

00:01:07.890 --> 00:01:08.960 
get these cases with you know four
double<00:01:08.130> electric<00:01:08.520> and<00:01:08.670> then<00:01:08.760> they'll<00:01:08.880> be

00:01:08.960 --> 00:01:08.970 
double electric and then they'll be

00:01:08.970 --> 00:01:11.120 
double electric and then they'll be
styling<00:01:09.450> but<00:01:10.049> just<00:01:10.470> like<00:01:10.590> all<00:01:10.740> of<00:01:10.770> our<00:01:10.950> hard

00:01:11.120 --> 00:01:11.130 
styling but just like all of our hard

00:01:11.130 --> 00:01:13.370 
styling but just like all of our hard
cases<00:01:11.580> they're<00:01:11.820> guaranteed<00:01:12.270> for<00:01:12.299> life<00:01:12.510> so<00:01:13.320> you

00:01:13.370 --> 00:01:13.380 
cases they're guaranteed for life so you

00:01:13.380 --> 00:01:15.890 
cases they're guaranteed for life so you
only<00:01:13.530> have<00:01:13.590> to<00:01:13.710> buy<00:01:13.860> on<00:01:14.010> one<00:01:14.189> time<00:01:14.570> u.s.<00:01:15.570> Street

00:01:15.890 --> 00:01:15.900 
only have to buy on one time u.s. Street

00:01:15.900 --> 00:01:19.060 
only have to buy on one time u.s. Street
on<00:01:16.080> the<00:01:16.110> acoustic<00:01:16.439> case<00:01:16.860> is<00:01:17.159> two<00:01:17.400> 99.99<00:01:18.360> and

00:01:19.060 --> 00:01:19.070 
on the acoustic case is two 99.99 and

00:01:19.070 --> 00:01:21.649 
on the acoustic case is two 99.99 and
you<00:01:20.070> know<00:01:20.189> they're<00:01:20.729> fully<00:01:21.090> lined

00:01:21.649 --> 00:01:21.659

stacking<00:01:31.380> lugs<00:01:31.619> I<00:01:31.829> don't<00:01:32.009> know<00:01:32.070> if<00:01:32.130> you<00:01:32.189> can

00:01:32.270 --> 00:01:32.280 
stacking lugs I don't know if you can

00:01:32.280 --> 00:01:34.819 
stacking lugs I don't know if you can
see<00:01:32.490> these<00:01:32.640> these<00:01:32.939> lugs<00:01:33.780> right<00:01:34.020> here<00:01:34.350> are

00:01:34.819 --> 00:01:34.829 
see these these lugs right here are

00:01:34.829 --> 00:01:36.980 
see these these lugs right here are
designed<00:01:35.040> for<00:01:35.460> stacking<00:01:35.729> so<00:01:36.509> what<00:01:36.659> you<00:01:36.750> can<00:01:36.900> do

00:01:36.980 --> 00:01:36.990 
designed for stacking so what you can do

00:01:36.990 --> 00:01:38.539 
designed for stacking so what you can do
is<00:01:37.110> you<00:01:37.290> can<00:01:37.409> actually<00:01:37.560> have<00:01:37.920> more<00:01:38.189> than<00:01:38.340> one

00:01:38.539 --> 00:01:38.549 
is you can actually have more than one

00:01:38.549 --> 00:01:43.389 
is you can actually have more than one
case<00:01:40.100> and<00:01:41.100> you<00:01:41.310> can<00:01:41.490> stack<00:01:41.759> them<00:01:41.939> together

00:01:43.389 --> 00:01:43.399 
case and you can stack them together

00:01:43.399 --> 00:01:44.840 
case and you can stack them together
sorry<00:01:44.399> about<00:01:44.610> that

00:01:44.840 --> 00:01:44.850 
sorry about that
