front of me I have the SOS t200 TAS see
now<00:00:09.000> this<00:00:09.150> model<00:00:09.450> has<00:00:09.599> a<00:00:09.870> hydride<00:00:10.530> bayonet

00:00:11.060 --> 00:00:11.070 
now this model has a hydride bayonet

00:00:11.070 --> 00:00:13.370 
now this model has a hydride bayonet
that's<00:00:11.849> came<00:00:12.210> empty<00:00:12.660> some<00:00:12.900> other<00:00:13.049> models<00:00:13.320> have

00:00:13.370 --> 00:00:13.380 
that's came empty some other models have

00:00:13.380 --> 00:00:16.490 
that's came empty some other models have
500<00:00:13.950> gigabyte<00:00:14.309> hard<00:00:14.340> drives<00:00:14.759> in<00:00:15.030> them<00:00:15.299> and<00:00:15.540> you

00:00:16.490 --> 00:00:16.500 
500 gigabyte hard drives in them and you

00:00:16.500 --> 00:00:18.800 
500 gigabyte hard drives in them and you
can<00:00:16.710> access<00:00:17.010> this<00:00:17.220> and<00:00:17.490> put<00:00:18.300> your<00:00:18.420> own<00:00:18.570> hard

00:00:18.800 --> 00:00:18.810

drive in there and to do that all you

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:24.310 
drive in there and to do that all you
need<00:00:21.060> to<00:00:21.270> do<00:00:21.420> is<00:00:21.630> remove<00:00:21.930> this<00:00:22.080> screw<00:00:22.199> here<00:00:22.619> and

00:00:24.310 --> 00:00:24.320 
need to do is remove this screw here and

00:00:24.320 --> 00:00:27.769 
need to do is remove this screw here and
then<00:00:25.320> slide<00:00:25.800> the<00:00:25.980> cover<00:00:26.160> forward<00:00:26.279> and<00:00:26.880> lift<00:00:27.660> it

00:00:27.769 --> 00:00:27.779 
then slide the cover forward and lift it

00:00:27.779 --> 00:00:32.590 
then slide the cover forward and lift it
out<00:00:29.990> inside<00:00:30.990> you<00:00:31.260> have<00:00:31.529> the<00:00:31.769> bracket<00:00:32.250> and

00:00:32.590 --> 00:00:32.600 
out inside you have the bracket and

00:00:32.600 --> 00:00:35.720 
out inside you have the bracket and
you'll<00:00:33.600> have<00:00:33.780> four<00:00:34.079> screws<00:00:34.440> inside<00:00:35.130> the<00:00:35.430> box

00:00:35.720 --> 00:00:35.730 
you'll have four screws inside the box

00:00:35.730 --> 00:00:38.360 
you'll have four screws inside the box
then<00:00:36.690> Asus<00:00:37.079> has<00:00:37.230> supplied<00:00:37.590> so<00:00:37.890> you<00:00:37.950> can<00:00:38.190> mount

00:00:38.360 --> 00:00:38.370 
then Asus has supplied so you can mount

00:00:38.370 --> 00:00:40.910 
then Asus has supplied so you can mount
a<00:00:38.579> hard<00:00:38.850> drive<00:00:39.090> in<00:00:39.329> there<00:00:39.510> so<00:00:39.750> I've<00:00:40.559> already

00:00:40.910 --> 00:00:40.920 
a hard drive in there so I've already

00:00:40.920 --> 00:00:42.560 
a hard drive in there so I've already
removed<00:00:41.309> the<00:00:41.370> four<00:00:41.610> screws<00:00:41.879> there<00:00:42.090> on<00:00:42.300> the

00:00:42.560 --> 00:00:42.570 
removed the four screws there on the

00:00:42.570 --> 00:00:46.580 
removed the four screws there on the
bracket<00:00:42.930> here<00:00:43.700> this<00:00:44.700> needs<00:00:44.940> to<00:00:45.030> come<00:00:45.239> out<00:00:45.590> and

00:00:46.580 --> 00:00:46.590 
bracket here this needs to come out and

00:00:46.590 --> 00:00:53.560 
bracket here this needs to come out and
you<00:00:46.910> can<00:00:47.910> put<00:00:47.940> your<00:00:48.649> hard<00:00:49.649> drive<00:00:49.890> in<00:00:50.190> there

00:00:53.560 --> 00:00:53.570 

00:00:53.570 --> 00:00:58.639 

then<00:00:54.570> put<00:00:54.750> that<00:00:54.899> back<00:00:55.140> into<00:00:55.350> the<00:00:55.530> system<00:00:57.649> like

00:00:58.639 --> 00:00:58.649 
then put that back into the system like

00:00:58.649 --> 00:01:03.039 
then put that back into the system like
so<00:00:59.010> now<00:01:00.000> it<00:01:00.210> needs<00:01:00.449> to<00:01:00.719> be<00:01:00.899> a<00:01:01.109> slim<00:01:02.000> seven

00:01:03.039 --> 00:01:03.049 
so now it needs to be a slim seven

00:01:03.049 --> 00:01:05.299 
so now it needs to be a slim seven
millimeter<00:01:04.049> hard<00:01:04.290> drive<00:01:04.530> as<00:01:04.739> you<00:01:04.769> can<00:01:05.070> see

00:01:05.299 --> 00:01:05.309 
millimeter hard drive as you can see

00:01:05.309 --> 00:01:08.090 
millimeter hard drive as you can see
here<00:01:05.700> this<00:01:06.659> hard<00:01:06.930> drive<00:01:07.200> is<00:01:07.470> going<00:01:07.710> to<00:01:07.799> be<00:01:07.890> too

00:01:08.090 --> 00:01:08.100 
here this hard drive is going to be too

00:01:08.100 --> 00:01:11.899 
here this hard drive is going to be too
big<00:01:09.650> and<00:01:10.650> I<00:01:10.860> don't<00:01:10.890> actually<00:01:11.220> think<00:01:11.400> I<00:01:11.700> have

00:01:11.899 --> 00:01:11.909 
big and I don't actually think I have

00:01:11.909 --> 00:01:15.020 
big and I don't actually think I have
this<00:01:12.060> in<00:01:12.360> the<00:01:12.390> right<00:01:12.750> way<00:01:12.810> not<00:01:13.229> don't<00:01:13.909> but<00:01:14.909> it's

00:01:15.020 --> 00:01:15.030 
this in the right way not don't but it's

00:01:15.030 --> 00:01:16.700 
this in the right way not don't but it's
too<00:01:15.210> tall<00:01:15.420> anyways<00:01:15.869> so<00:01:16.080> it<00:01:16.170> has<00:01:16.290> to<00:01:16.439> be<00:01:16.500> one<00:01:16.619> of

00:01:16.700 --> 00:01:16.710 
too tall anyways so it has to be one of

00:01:16.710 --> 00:01:20.679 
too tall anyways so it has to be one of
the<00:01:16.830> slimmer<00:01:17.280> low<00:01:17.490> profile<00:01:18.090> hard<00:01:18.360> drives

00:01:20.679 --> 00:01:20.689 

00:01:20.689 --> 00:01:24.740 

because<00:01:21.689> that<00:01:21.900> is<00:01:22.310> too<00:01:23.310> high<00:01:23.490> and<00:01:24.119> it's<00:01:24.630> not

00:01:24.740 --> 00:01:24.750 
because that is too high and it's not

00:01:24.750 --> 00:01:29.450 
because that is too high and it's not
going<00:01:24.900> to<00:01:24.990> fit<00:01:25.820> so<00:01:26.820> if<00:01:27.479> you<00:01:27.750> gonna<00:01:28.080> get<00:01:28.530> a<00:01:28.890> hard

00:01:29.450 --> 00:01:29.460 
going to fit so if you gonna get a hard

00:01:29.460 --> 00:01:31.100 
going to fit so if you gonna get a hard
drive<00:01:29.670> for<00:01:29.939> it<00:01:29.970> in<00:01:30.150> your<00:01:30.240> looking<00:01:30.540> maybe<00:01:30.720> add

00:01:31.100 --> 00:01:31.110 
drive for it in your looking maybe add

00:01:31.110 --> 00:01:34.550 
drive for it in your looking maybe add
an<00:01:31.700> SSD<00:01:32.700> which<00:01:33.180> might<00:01:33.450> actually<00:01:33.720> be<00:01:34.290> a<00:01:34.320> bit<00:01:34.470> of

00:01:34.550 --> 00:01:34.560 
an SSD which might actually be a bit of

00:01:34.560 --> 00:01:37.580 
an SSD which might actually be a bit of
an<00:01:34.650> overkill<00:01:35.070> for<00:01:35.369> this<00:01:35.579> tablet<00:01:36.530> because<00:01:37.530> it

00:01:37.580 --> 00:01:37.590 
an overkill for this tablet because it

00:01:37.590 --> 00:01:41.569 
an overkill for this tablet because it
is<00:01:37.710> going<00:01:38.009> through<00:01:38.220> USB<00:01:38.869> bus<00:01:39.869> I<00:01:40.079> think<00:01:40.579> you

00:01:41.569 --> 00:01:41.579 
is going through USB bus I think you

00:01:41.579 --> 00:01:43.730 
is going through USB bus I think you
need<00:01:41.820> to<00:01:41.880> make<00:01:42.479> sure<00:01:42.689> you<00:01:42.869> get<00:01:43.020> a<00:01:43.229> seven

00:01:43.730 --> 00:01:43.740 
need to make sure you get a seven

00:01:43.740 --> 00:01:47.840 
need to make sure you get a seven
millimeter<00:01:44.610> one<00:01:45.049> so<00:01:46.049> you<00:01:46.110> go<00:01:46.380> that's<00:01:46.680> the<00:01:46.950> bib

00:01:47.840 --> 00:01:47.850 
millimeter one so you go that's the bib

00:01:47.850 --> 00:01:52.749 
millimeter one so you go that's the bib
a<00:01:48.060> hard<00:01:48.509> drive<00:01:48.689> bay<00:01:48.899> on<00:01:49.170> the<00:01:49.200> Zeus<00:01:49.890> T<00:01:50.399> 200<00:01:51.060> ta
