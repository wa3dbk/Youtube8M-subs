00:00:14.789 --> 00:00:19.930
 alien isolation is surwaiv horror 

00:00:17.710 --> 00:00:21.850
 everything is a style of play in deeds 

00:00:19.930 --> 00:00:22.630
 which the player will commit and at risk 

00:00:21.850 --> 00:00:24.880
 on which 

00:00:22.630 --> 00:00:26.610
 step by step he will have to take risks and 

00:00:24.880 --> 00:00:29.080
 to think quickly what to do 

00:00:26.610 --> 00:00:34.149
 man against almost perfect 

00:00:29.080 --> 00:00:37.600
 the killer player is not ready to fight with him for 

00:00:34.149 --> 00:00:41.199
 the basis is taken the classic feeling will be 

00:00:37.600 --> 00:00:43.120
 just indescribable the idea is not to 

00:00:41.199 --> 00:00:45.399
 killing clouds of monsters and not even in 

00:00:43.120 --> 00:00:47.350
 victory on strangers namely collision 

00:00:45.399 --> 00:00:49.949
 with this terrible creation and attempts 

00:00:47.350 --> 00:00:49.949
 survive after 

00:00:53.059 --> 00:00:58.710
 we wanted to create and show that stranger 

00:00:56.010 --> 00:01:00.809
 who was in the classic movie of the stranger 

00:00:58.710 --> 00:01:01.969
 who would do what he wanted and was 

00:01:00.809 --> 00:01:04.920
 evicted 

00:01:01.969 --> 00:01:09.439
 so alien that would look at the player 

00:01:04.920 --> 00:01:09.439
 top down and dictate their terms 

00:01:15.080 --> 00:01:20.700
 it is impossible to give every creak 

00:01:18.659 --> 00:01:23.280
 time everything should seem but if we want 

00:01:20.700 --> 00:01:24.979
 so that he inspired fear you can do 

00:01:23.280 --> 00:01:27.600
 so that the player did not survive to meet 

00:01:24.979 --> 00:01:29.729
 so that it is not so that after the restart he 

00:01:27.600 --> 00:01:31.440
 does the same thing and destroy everything 

00:01:29.729 --> 00:01:33.569
 desire to play he will react 

00:01:31.440 --> 00:01:36.270
 listen dynamically and try 

00:01:33.569 --> 00:01:40.020
 find a player it will make the player more often 

00:01:36.270 --> 00:01:41.759
 look the sea ​​will adrenaline 

00:01:40.020 --> 00:01:44.640
 funny is that people will be afraid 

00:01:41.759 --> 00:01:47.959
 even when someone else’s soup and because you don’t 

00:01:44.640 --> 00:01:50.549
 know where we are now where will appear 

00:01:47.959 --> 00:01:52.289
 for example, once I hide and survive a 

00:01:50.549 --> 00:01:54.509
 here is another time I will not succeed 

00:01:52.289 --> 00:01:57.090
 here it is this unknown and 

00:01:54.509 --> 00:01:59.399
 player overwhelms adrenaline makes 

00:01:57.090 --> 00:02:02.250
 heart beat faster in this and 

00:01:59.399 --> 00:02:05.210
 is the meaning of survival the game will give 

00:02:02.250 --> 00:02:05.210
 you have a brighter feeling 

00:02:09.700 --> 00:02:15.129
 so alien isolation comes out at the end of 2014 

00:02:13.120 --> 00:02:18.629
 years on while playstation 3 and playstation 

00:02:15.129 --> 00:02:18.629
