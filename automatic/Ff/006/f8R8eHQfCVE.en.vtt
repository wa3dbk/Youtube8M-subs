00:00:19.140 --> 00:00:23.849

00:00:20.880 --> 00:00:25.439
 and possibly many of you and 

00:00:23.849 --> 00:00:28.080
 many of you will feel 

00:00:25.439 --> 00:00:30.060
 identified with this situation the 

00:00:28.080 --> 00:00:32.010
 question does not get it 

00:00:30.060 --> 00:00:34.920
 cardigan and the question says the following 

00:00:32.010 --> 00:00:37.530
 hi carlos congratulations and thanks for 

00:00:34.920 --> 00:00:39.120
 your videos I 'll gladly write you 

00:00:37.530 --> 00:00:41.100
 because I have a problem I have 

00:00:39.120 --> 00:00:43.830
 presented a great opportunity for 

00:00:41.100 --> 00:00:46.469
 start my own business my husband and 

00:00:43.830 --> 00:00:48.120
 I have a good job and I have the 

00:00:46.469 --> 00:00:50.969
 enough money saved for 

00:00:48.120 --> 00:00:53.430
 begin it the problem that I have is that 

00:00:50.969 --> 00:00:56.520
 my husband refuses completely to 

00:00:53.430 --> 00:00:58.739
 support me we have played in several 

00:00:56.520 --> 00:01:01.289
 Sometimes the problem but always 

00:00:58.739 --> 00:01:04.379
 we ended up fighting what can I do 

00:01:01.289 --> 00:01:06.090
 carlos hello cardigan thank you very much for your 

00:01:04.379 --> 00:01:08.550
 Ask the first thing I want to say 

00:01:06.090 --> 00:01:11.970
 is that you are not alone many women 

00:01:08.550 --> 00:01:14.100
 and men with that entrepreneurial spirit 

00:01:11.970 --> 00:01:16.289
 come to feel a great friction with 

00:01:14.100 --> 00:01:18.209
 their families when starting their own 

00:01:16.289 --> 00:01:19.020
 business first thing I recommend 

00:01:18.209 --> 00:01:21.359
 cardigan is 

00:01:19.020 --> 00:01:23.490
 you involve your husband to men by 

00:01:21.359 --> 00:01:25.530
 nature we like to compete and when 

00:01:23.490 --> 00:01:28.740
 we see that our partner is doing 

00:01:25.530 --> 00:01:31.020
 something out of the ordinary that instinct for 

00:01:28.740 --> 00:01:32.640
 compete comes out afloat then you 

00:01:31.020 --> 00:01:34.920
 I recommend that you involve your husband 

00:01:32.640 --> 00:01:36.840
 ask for his help let him know that his 

00:01:34.920 --> 00:01:39.179
 knowledge will be useful for the 

00:01:36.840 --> 00:01:41.329
 business growth to every man 

00:01:39.179 --> 00:01:44.340
 to some extent he likes to feel 

00:01:41.329 --> 00:01:46.649
 needed by the woman he loves so 

00:01:44.340 --> 00:01:49.020
 that does not exclude your husband to the contrary 

00:01:46.649 --> 00:01:50.939
 make it part of the business the second thing that 

00:01:49.020 --> 00:01:53.130
 you need to do is make it clear 

00:01:50.939 --> 00:01:55.470
 that business is not just for you 

00:01:53.130 --> 00:01:57.869
 but for the whole family make a list 

00:01:55.470 --> 00:02:00.239
 of all the things that your family 

00:01:57.869 --> 00:02:02.579
 will achieve thanks to the new business 

00:02:00.239 --> 00:02:04.770
 surely more vacation maybe a 

00:02:02.579 --> 00:02:06.750
 new house or be able to register your children 

00:02:04.770 --> 00:02:08.759
 in extracurricular activities or in 

00:02:06.750 --> 00:02:10.349
 a new school is very important that 

00:02:08.759 --> 00:02:12.030
 make this clear because the 

00:02:10.349 --> 00:02:14.610
 reality is that you do not want to start that 

00:02:12.030 --> 00:02:16.319
 business merely by distraction all 

00:02:14.610 --> 00:02:18.840
 we start with our own business 

00:02:16.319 --> 00:02:20.940
 to be able to devote more time to 

00:02:18.840 --> 00:02:23.579
 our loved ones and can give them 

00:02:20.940 --> 00:02:25.829
 maybe what we did not have what 

00:02:23.579 --> 00:02:26.310
 third thing you should do is understand the 

00:02:25.829 --> 00:02:28.680
 point 

00:02:26.310 --> 00:02:30.569
 of sight of your husband look in all 

00:02:28.680 --> 00:02:32.849
 negotiation it is important that we understand 

00:02:30.569 --> 00:02:35.520
 and we put ourselves in the shoes of the other 

00:02:32.849 --> 00:02:37.950
 person to in this way understand their 

00:02:35.520 --> 00:02:41.250
 fears and to be able to reach an agreement in the 

00:02:37.950 --> 00:02:43.950
 that both are satisfied look at me as 

00:02:41.250 --> 00:02:46.620
 husband and dad of two little girls I 

00:02:43.950 --> 00:02:49.140
 I put in the shoes of your husband such 

00:02:46.620 --> 00:02:51.180
 he feels that with this new business he does not 

00:02:49.140 --> 00:02:53.910
 You can dedicate time to the family or 

00:02:51.180 --> 00:02:56.040
 that you can not spend time with him or 

00:02:53.910 --> 00:02:58.290
 maybe you think that the savings of 

00:02:56.040 --> 00:02:59.970
 surely many years will go in the 

00:02:58.290 --> 00:03:01.890
 new business looks like it already 

00:02:59.970 --> 00:03:04.200
 we mentioned the benefits of that 

00:03:01.890 --> 00:03:06.269
 business will not only be for you but 

00:03:04.200 --> 00:03:08.670
 will be for the whole family and equal 

00:03:06.269 --> 00:03:10.860
 way the whole family should be in the 

00:03:08.670 --> 00:03:12.989
 same channel when deciding to enter 

00:03:10.860 --> 00:03:15.569
 in the business what do I mean by this 

00:03:12.989 --> 00:03:18.000
 before entering the business does the 

00:03:15.569 --> 00:03:20.400
 commitment to yourself and then with 

00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:22.440
 your family not to leave aside all 

00:03:20.400 --> 00:03:25.380
 those things that are important to 

00:03:22.440 --> 00:03:27.780
 everyone as a family is very true that the 

00:03:25.380 --> 00:03:29.700
 Starting a business requires many 

00:03:27.780 --> 00:03:31.750
 sacrifices but it's also true that 

00:03:29.700 --> 00:03:35.080
 you need to have good 

00:03:31.750 --> 00:03:37.090
 that you are not willing to sacrifice for 

00:03:35.080 --> 00:03:38.920
 that business I'll give you an example 

00:03:37.090 --> 00:03:41.470
 we in our company do not 

00:03:38.920 --> 00:03:44.230
 we work neither weekends nor after 

00:03:41.470 --> 00:03:46.270
 at 5 in the afternoon for me to dedicate 

00:03:44.230 --> 00:03:47.950
 quality time to my daughters and my 

00:03:46.270 --> 00:03:50.260
 wife is one of my highest priorities 

00:03:47.950 --> 00:03:53.440
 and I'm not willing to sacrifice this 

00:03:50.260 --> 00:03:55.840
 time for my business is more our 

00:03:53.440 --> 00:03:57.790
 customers and the work team know 

00:03:55.840 --> 00:03:59.560
 that we will not be working during 

00:03:57.790 --> 00:04:02.290
 weekends or after five 

00:03:59.560 --> 00:04:04.690
 in the afternoon the balance between the 

00:04:02.290 --> 00:04:07.270
 family life and our company is part 

00:04:04.690 --> 00:04:09.760
 of our values and it's something that does not 

00:04:07.270 --> 00:04:11.080
 we are willing to sacrifice so 

00:04:09.760 --> 00:04:13.270
 I invite you to have that 

00:04:11.080 --> 00:04:15.190
 Heart to heart conversation with you 

00:04:13.270 --> 00:04:17.799
 husband and put things right in clear 

00:04:15.190 --> 00:04:20.650
 define that you are not willing to 

00:04:17.799 --> 00:04:23.200
 sacrifice for that business last 

00:04:20.650 --> 00:04:25.270
 maybe if the problem is not the 

00:04:23.200 --> 00:04:27.400
 business opportunity maybe the 

00:04:25.270 --> 00:04:29.530
 problem is in itself the relationship of couple 

00:04:27.400 --> 00:04:31.510
 I 'm not a couple consultant, not a lot 

00:04:29.530 --> 00:04:33.940
 less but as a husband I can tell you 

00:04:31.510 --> 00:04:36.280
 that sometimes it is necessary to leave everything to a 

00:04:33.940 --> 00:04:37.910
 side to be good with the person to 

00:04:36.280 --> 00:04:41.180
 whom we chose to make us 

00:04:37.910 --> 00:04:43.220
 put your family first and then put 

00:04:41.180 --> 00:04:45.350
 that project if you manage to be fine with your 

00:04:43.220 --> 00:04:47.360
 family the adventure of undertaking will be 

00:04:45.350 --> 00:04:50.990
 much more pleasant for all 

00:04:47.360 --> 00:04:53.570
 I hope this video card will serve you 

00:04:50.990 --> 00:04:55.340
 a lot if you have had problems with your 

00:04:53.570 --> 00:04:57.770
 loved ones when starting your own 

00:04:55.340 --> 00:04:59.810
