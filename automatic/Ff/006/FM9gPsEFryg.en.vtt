00:00:00.110 --> 00:00:04.620
 friends now very well loved and I 

00:00:02.520 --> 00:00:06.000
 would like to have a question for you and indeed 

00:00:04.620 --> 00:00:09.540
 We are now with our Germany 

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:10.769
 campaign at hearts of iron 3 by the 

00:00:09.540 --> 00:00:12.480
 I think a relatively successful campaign 

00:00:10.769 --> 00:00:13.410
 I think it also has you relative 

00:00:12.480 --> 00:00:15.450
 a lot of fun 

00:00:13.410 --> 00:00:16.500
 I also hope that I have a lot 

00:00:15.450 --> 00:00:19.020
 fun and now of course the 

00:00:16.500 --> 00:00:20.910
 ask what comes next 17 

00:00:19.020 --> 00:00:23.670
 fall i believe with germany 

00:00:20.910 --> 00:00:26.760
 have spent until 19 48 until the end of the year 

00:00:23.670 --> 00:00:28.230
 played everything for what 

00:00:26.760 --> 00:00:30.480
 was important to me or for germany 

00:00:28.230 --> 00:00:33.780
 was and is important of course 

00:00:30.480 --> 00:00:37.230
 ask what comes then we would have 

00:00:33.780 --> 00:00:43.860
 offer france scenario of course 

00:00:37.230 --> 00:00:45.870
 again 19 36 to 48 and that the 

00:00:43.860 --> 00:00:47.280
 German attack to defend 

00:00:45.870 --> 00:00:48.600
 claim and then against in the 

00:00:47.280 --> 00:00:49.920
 offensive to go especially in italy 

00:00:48.600 --> 00:00:52.440
 but also against Germany 

00:00:49.920 --> 00:00:54.780
 and then maybe like that 

00:00:52.440 --> 00:00:56.730
 Soviet Union if she then fights with us 

00:00:54.780 --> 00:01:00.449
 against Germany which is believe me I 

00:00:56.730 --> 00:01:04.640
 the whole scenario so who option 

00:01:00.449 --> 00:01:06.960
 france then if options italy 

00:01:04.640 --> 00:01:09.720
 simply with german together the world 

00:01:06.960 --> 00:01:11.939
 the opera africa campaign and then too 

00:01:09.720 --> 00:01:14.270
 still offensively against Great Britain against 

00:01:11.939 --> 00:01:18.869
 the government and against the us 

00:01:14.270 --> 00:01:22.159
 the tv mario and number 3 because itself 

00:01:18.869 --> 00:01:25.350
 to choose would be in japan 

00:01:22.159 --> 00:01:27.630
 everything here with japan in the asian region 

00:01:25.350 --> 00:01:31.530
 chop up and then against 

00:01:27.630 --> 00:01:33.840
 to pass the great us and they too 

00:01:31.530 --> 00:01:38.360
 take and then continue to look 

00:01:33.840 --> 00:01:40.799
 union with muslim but still japan 

00:01:38.360 --> 00:01:43.140
 and I just wanted to put the three of you 

00:01:40.799 --> 00:01:48.140
 think oh come the place also the usa 

00:01:43.140 --> 00:01:50.640
 as option will simply upgrade and 

00:01:48.140 --> 00:01:52.439
 maybe some exercise trains drive 

00:01:50.640 --> 00:01:55.770
 not quite historically correct and 

00:01:52.439 --> 00:01:59.710
 Although look what is there 

00:01:55.770 --> 00:02:04.780
 maybe mexico or here 

00:01:59.710 --> 00:02:06.460
 but they start watching so look for them 

00:02:04.780 --> 00:02:08.800
 from comments I write 

00:02:06.460 --> 00:02:10.509
 if their victims had to be I know 

00:02:08.800 --> 00:02:11.790
 but not the same campaign time 

00:02:10.509 --> 00:02:14.980
 arrived very well 

00:02:11.790 --> 00:02:17.020
 and then i hope that i will for you 

00:02:14.980 --> 00:02:18.700
 continue to play that may now me 

00:02:17.020 --> 00:02:21.540
 diligent comments write what he writes 

00:02:18.700 --> 00:02:25.330
 wanted to see if the do not want to see it 

00:02:21.540 --> 00:02:25.959
 if i'm sad which second one though 

00:02:25.330 --> 00:02:27.760
 also OK 

00:02:25.959 --> 00:02:30.280
 you are the spectators everyone seems 

00:02:27.760 --> 00:02:34.480
 So stop and forget exactly 

00:02:30.280 --> 00:02:35.130
 that choice exactly four, of course 

00:02:34.480 --> 00:02:37.630
 still in there 

00:02:35.130 --> 00:02:39.550
 clearly against that insist the 

00:02:37.630 --> 00:02:42.130
 go offensive and then maybe 

00:02:39.550 --> 00:02:46.860
 even or actually against 

00:02:42.130 --> 00:02:50.110
 to fight the US now has scored 15 

00:02:46.860 --> 00:02:52.300
 great and hopefully see you 

00:02:50.110 --> 00:02:54.310
 in your chosen campaign for 

00:02:52.300 --> 00:02:58.260
 That's exactly what it was before three and one 

00:02:54.310 --> 00:02:58.260
 First of all, I am the one of j
