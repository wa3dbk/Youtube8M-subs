21:33 or 40cc

00:00:23.769 --> 00:00:33.060 
21:33 or 40cc
and<00:00:26.430> actually<00:00:27.539> 2240<00:00:28.539> see<00:00:29.130> it's<00:00:31.590> just<00:00:32.590> ruined

00:00:33.060 --> 00:00:33.070 
and actually 2240 see it's just ruined

00:00:33.070 --> 00:00:36.240 
and actually 2240 see it's just ruined
you<00:00:33.250> to<00:00:33.460> stroke<00:00:33.820> and<00:00:34.750> money<00:00:35.530> to<00:00:35.710> get<00:00:35.829> a<00:00:35.890> squat

00:00:36.240 --> 00:00:36.250 
you to stroke and money to get a squat

00:00:36.250 --> 00:00:43.560 
you to stroke and money to get a squat
so<00:00:36.430> I<00:00:36.489> kept<00:00:36.730> four<00:00:41.280> threads<00:00:42.280> on<00:00:42.579> the<00:00:42.699> end<00:00:42.729> of<00:00:43.000> the

00:00:43.560 --> 00:00:43.570 
so I kept four threads on the end of the

00:00:43.570 --> 00:00:48.930 
so I kept four threads on the end of the
shaft<00:00:43.780> broken<00:00:45.659> crank<00:00:46.659> off<00:00:47.699> right<00:00:48.699> at<00:00:48.909> the

00:00:48.930 --> 00:00:48.940 
shaft broken crank off right at the

00:00:48.940 --> 00:00:51.509 
shaft broken crank off right at the
mounting<00:00:49.540> because<00:00:49.720> in<00:00:49.989> the<00:00:50.470> wash<00:00:51.219> it<00:00:51.429> was

00:00:51.509 --> 00:00:51.519 
mounting because in the wash it was

00:00:51.519 --> 00:00:54.389 
mounting because in the wash it was
being<00:00:51.730> that's<00:00:52.379> screwing<00:00:53.379> there<00:00:53.679> and<00:00:53.890> there's

00:00:54.389 --> 00:00:54.399 
being that's screwing there and there's

00:00:54.399 --> 00:00:56.970 
being that's screwing there and there's
a<00:00:54.460> washer<00:00:54.640> there<00:00:55.059> I<00:00:55.090> find<00:00:55.480> to<00:00:55.629> get<00:00:56.379> a<00:00:56.440> piece<00:00:56.859> of

00:00:56.970 --> 00:00:56.980 
a washer there I find to get a piece of

00:00:56.980 --> 00:00:59.729 
a washer there I find to get a piece of
metal<00:00:57.070> of<00:00:57.250> that<00:00:57.399> thick<00:00:57.730> and<00:00:58.000> then<00:00:58.559> mount<00:00:59.559> that

00:00:59.729 --> 00:00:59.739 
metal of that thick and then mount that

00:00:59.739 --> 00:01:04.740 
metal of that thick and then mount that
to<00:00:59.980> a<00:01:00.010> base<00:01:01.199> then<00:01:02.199> in<00:01:02.289> the<00:01:02.410> back<00:01:02.620> here<00:01:03.039> I<00:01:03.750> once

00:01:04.740 --> 00:01:04.750 
to a base then in the back here I once

00:01:04.750 --> 00:01:08.219 
to a base then in the back here I once
moves<00:01:05.170> a<00:01:05.259> little<00:01:05.350> bit<00:01:05.649> and<00:01:06.100> then<00:01:07.050> mount<00:01:08.050> those

00:01:08.219 --> 00:01:08.229 
moves a little bit and then mount those

00:01:08.229 --> 00:01:12.419 
moves a little bit and then mount those
to<00:01:08.410> a<00:01:08.500> basic<00:01:08.970> and<00:01:09.970> then<00:01:10.060> I<00:01:10.119> kind<00:01:10.450> of<00:01:10.539> run<00:01:10.869> it<00:01:11.429> so

00:01:12.419 --> 00:01:12.429 
to a basic and then I kind of run it so

00:01:12.429 --> 00:01:14.249 
to a basic and then I kind of run it so
your<00:01:12.610> carbon<00:01:13.000> the<00:01:13.060> fuel<00:01:13.300> Induction<00:01:13.479> with<00:01:14.110> you

00:01:14.249 --> 00:01:14.259 
your carbon the fuel Induction with you

00:01:14.259 --> 00:01:19.410 
your carbon the fuel Induction with you
better<00:01:17.280> check<00:01:18.280> the<00:01:18.340> piston<00:01:18.729> is<00:01:18.850> an<00:01:18.940> absolutely

00:01:19.410 --> 00:01:19.420 
better check the piston is an absolutely

00:01:19.420 --> 00:01:21.300 
better check the piston is an absolutely
no<00:01:19.630> sign<00:01:19.960> of<00:01:20.110> spoiling<00:01:20.590> I<00:01:20.679> don't<00:01:20.860> think<00:01:21.130> that's
