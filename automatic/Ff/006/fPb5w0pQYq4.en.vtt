two<00:00:26.870> background<00:00:27.440> stitches<00:00:28.060> now<00:00:29.060> the

00:00:29.279 --> 00:00:29.289 
two background stitches now the

00:00:29.289 --> 00:00:33.490

instructions call for us to c4f and that

00:00:33.500 --> 00:00:35.889 
instructions call for us to c4f and that
means<00:00:33.770> that<00:00:34.160> we<00:00:34.280> are<00:00:34.430> going<00:00:34.730> to<00:00:34.850> hold<00:00:35.089> two

00:01:23.980 --> 00:01:23.990 
side now the instructions call for is to

00:01:23.990 --> 00:01:29.230 
side now the instructions call for is to
Nick<00:01:24.800> to<00:01:25.510> and<00:01:26.980> then<00:01:27.980> purl<00:01:28.310> to<00:01:28.580> background

00:01:29.230 --> 00:01:29.240 
Nick to and then purl to background

00:01:29.240 --> 00:01:38.200 
Nick to and then purl to background
stitches<00:01:33.280> as<00:01:35.380> you<00:01:36.380> can<00:01:36.740> see<00:01:37.010> when<00:01:37.640> you<00:01:37.790> use<00:01:37.970> the

00:01:38.200 --> 00:01:38.210 
stitches as you can see when you use the

00:01:38.210 --> 00:01:41.590 
stitches as you can see when you use the
cable<00:01:39.190> you<00:01:40.190> put<00:01:40.370> the<00:01:40.520> right<00:01:40.729> hand<00:01:40.760> leg<00:01:41.240> of<00:01:41.479> the

00:01:41.590 --> 00:01:41.600 
cable you put the right hand leg of the

00:01:41.600 --> 00:01:45.310 
cable you put the right hand leg of the
braid<00:01:41.840> in<00:01:42.550> so<00:01:43.550> that's<00:01:44.180> how<00:01:44.420> you<00:01:44.510> use<00:01:44.690> a<00:01:44.870> cable

braid in so that's how you use a cable

00:01:45.320 --> 00:01:47.860 
braid in so that's how you use a cable
needle<00:01:45.440> for<00:01:45.860> the<00:01:46.010> cables<00:01:46.479> we'll<00:01:47.479> get<00:01:47.630> to<00:01:47.750> the

00:01:47.860 --> 00:01:47.870 
needle for the cables we'll get to the

00:01:47.870 --> 00:01:49.780 
needle for the cables we'll get to the
other<00:01:47.990> side<00:01:48.320> and<00:01:48.500> show<00:01:48.619> you<00:01:48.680> how<00:01:48.950> to<00:01:48.979> form<00:01:49.400> the

we're ready to form the left-hand leg of
this<00:01:58.940> braided<00:01:59.420> cable<00:01:59.869> so<00:02:00.770> the<00:02:00.920> instructions

00:02:01.480 --> 00:02:01.490 
this braided cable so the instructions

00:02:01.490 --> 00:02:07.719 
this braided cable so the instructions
call<00:02:01.759> for<00:02:01.790> us<00:02:02.509> to<00:02:03.759> knit<00:02:04.759> two<00:02:05.090> stitches<00:02:06.729> like

00:02:07.719 --> 00:02:07.729 
call for us to knit two stitches like

00:02:07.729 --> 00:02:12.190 
call for us to knit two stitches like
this<00:02:07.790> one<00:02:08.690> two<00:02:10.270> then<00:02:11.270> the<00:02:11.420> instructions<00:02:11.959> call

00:02:12.190 --> 00:02:12.200 
this one two then the instructions call

00:02:12.200 --> 00:02:15.699 
this one two then the instructions call
for<00:02:12.230> C<00:02:13.040> for<00:02:13.489> B<00:02:14.000> and<00:02:14.360> that<00:02:14.780> tells<00:02:15.050> us<00:02:15.260> that<00:02:15.290> this

00:02:15.699 --> 00:02:15.709 
for C for B and that tells us that this

00:02:15.709 --> 00:02:17.710 
for C for B and that tells us that this
time<00:02:15.980> we're<00:02:16.550> going<00:02:16.760> to<00:02:16.850> hold<00:02:17.030> the<00:02:17.180> stitches<00:02:17.570> to

00:02:17.710 --> 00:02:17.720 
time we're going to hold the stitches to

00:02:17.720 --> 00:02:20.500 
time we're going to hold the stitches to
the<00:02:17.750> back<00:02:18.050> of<00:02:18.260> our<00:02:18.350> work<00:02:18.640> so<00:02:19.640> we'll<00:02:20.000> slip<00:02:20.300> the

00:02:20.500 --> 00:02:20.510

00:02:20.510 --> 00:02:22.900 
the back of our work so we'll slip the
next<00:02:20.840> two<00:02:21.049> stitches<00:02:21.380> onto<00:02:21.860> our<00:02:22.160> cable<00:02:22.580> needle

00:02:22.900 --> 00:02:22.910 
next two stitches onto our cable needle

00:02:22.910 --> 00:02:26.920 
next two stitches onto our cable needle
like<00:02:23.150> this<00:02:25.090> but<00:02:26.090> this<00:02:26.269> time<00:02:26.510> we're<00:02:26.690> going<00:02:26.720> to

00:02:26.920 --> 00:02:26.930

hold<00:02:27.140> the<00:02:27.410> cable<00:02:27.620> to<00:02:27.920> the<00:02:27.980> back<00:02:28.070> of<00:02:28.549> our<00:02:28.730> work

00:02:30.270 --> 00:02:30.280 
hold the cable to the back of our work

00:02:30.280 --> 00:02:33.880 
hold the cable to the back of our work
when<00:02:31.280> we<00:02:31.430> knit<00:02:31.670> these<00:02:31.850> two<00:02:32.209> stitches<00:02:32.560> off<00:02:33.560> the

when we knit these two stitches off the
left<00:02:34.100> hand<00:02:34.370> needle<00:02:34.760> you'll<00:02:35.510> see<00:02:35.810> that<00:02:36.110> it

00:02:36.340 --> 00:02:36.350 
left hand needle you'll see that it

00:02:36.350 --> 00:02:39.699 
left hand needle you'll see that it
causes<00:02:36.799> them<00:02:36.980> to<00:02:37.190> cross<00:02:37.459> to<00:02:37.760> the<00:02:37.790> front<00:02:38.269> of<00:02:38.709> the

00:02:39.699 --> 00:02:39.709 
causes them to cross to the front of the

00:02:39.709 --> 00:02:42.190 
causes them to cross to the front of the
other<00:02:39.830> two<00:02:40.100> stitches<00:02:40.610> like<00:02:41.299> this<00:02:41.360> and<00:02:41.930> that'll

00:02:42.190 --> 00:02:42.200 
other two stitches like this and that'll

00:02:42.200 --> 00:02:45.610 
other two stitches like this and that'll
form<00:02:42.440> the<00:02:42.590> left-hand<00:02:43.040> leg<00:02:43.220> of<00:02:43.430> that<00:02:43.459> braid<00:02:44.620> now

00:02:45.610 --> 00:02:45.620 
form the left-hand leg of that braid now

00:02:45.620 --> 00:02:47.560 
form the left-hand leg of that braid now
we<00:02:45.680> come<00:02:46.040> in<00:02:46.280> and<00:02:46.549> knit<00:02:47.000> the<00:02:47.150> next<00:02:47.299> two

00:02:47.560 --> 00:02:47.570 
we come in and knit the next two

00:02:47.570 --> 00:02:50.970 
we come in and knit the next two
stitches<00:02:47.600> right<00:02:48.500> off<00:02:48.799> of<00:02:49.010> that<00:02:49.190> cable<00:02:49.459> needle

00:02:50.970 --> 00:02:50.980 
stitches right off of that cable needle

00:02:50.980 --> 00:02:54.390 
stitches right off of that cable needle
like<00:02:51.980> this<00:02:52.690> whoops

00:02:54.390 --> 00:02:54.400 
like this whoops

00:02:54.400 --> 00:03:00.910 
like this whoops
that<00:02:55.400> happens<00:02:55.970> sometimes<00:02:59.410> now<00:03:00.410> you<00:03:00.470> can<00:03:00.709> set

00:03:00.910 --> 00:03:00.920 
that happens sometimes now you can set

00:03:00.920 --> 00:03:04.360 
that happens sometimes now you can set
your<00:03:01.040> cable<00:03:01.370> needle<00:03:01.670> aside<00:03:02.030> and<00:03:02.980> we'll<00:03:03.980> purl

00:03:14.050 --> 00:03:14.060 
and as you'll see we have formed another

00:03:14.060 --> 00:03:17.290 
and as you'll see we have formed another
