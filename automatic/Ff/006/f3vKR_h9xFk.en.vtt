00:00:25.650 --> 00:00:29.130
 the university is what follows 

00:00:27.449 --> 00:00:30.990
 after the baccalaureate has been arranged 

00:00:29.130 --> 00:00:36.890
 of leaving school you have to wear

00:00:42.890 --> 00:00:46.400

00:01:09.320 --> 00:01:12.680
 types of universities is science 

00:01:11.060 --> 00:01:15.260
 public or government is the audience 

00:01:12.680 --> 00:01:16.970
 private the public is that well be 

00:01:15.260 --> 00:01:19.070
 that fits with all your expenses in 

00:01:16.970 --> 00:01:20.480
 change the private do not notice in the public 

00:01:19.070 --> 00:01:24.160
 the way through with tests 

00:01:20.480 --> 00:01:24.160
 been like this 

00:01:26.030 --> 00:01:28.970

 late to study at a university 

00:01:28.970 --> 00:01:34.150
 state public 

00:01:34.840 --> 00:01:39.890
 in the private happens the opposite that 

00:01:38.150 --> 00:01:41.150
 it has been the test state to it does not 

00:01:39.890 --> 00:01:42.560

00:01:41.150 --> 00:01:44.119

 public universities enter all 

00:02:02.330 --> 00:02:05.420
 happy because they have passed an audience 

00:02:03.590 --> 00:02:07.550
 public where it is difficult to pass but 

00:02:05.420 --> 00:02:09.979
