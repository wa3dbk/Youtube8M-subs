design point of view this is a really

design point of view this is a really
nice<00:01:06.210> looking<00:01:06.630> device<00:01:06.810> it's<00:01:07.439> difficult<00:01:08.130> to

00:01:08.240 --> 00:01:08.250 
nice looking device it's difficult to

00:01:08.250 --> 00:01:10.010 
nice looking device it's difficult to
kind<00:01:08.490> of<00:01:08.610> pick<00:01:08.909> anything<00:01:09.180> that<00:01:09.479> you<00:01:09.570> can<00:01:09.840> look

00:01:10.010 --> 00:01:10.020 
kind of pick anything that you can look

00:01:10.020 --> 00:01:12.250 
kind of pick anything that you can look
and<00:01:10.140> go<00:01:10.290> mmm<00:01:10.619> that's<00:01:11.010> a<00:01:11.130> little<00:01:11.340> bit<00:01:11.549> ugly

00:01:12.250 --> 00:01:12.260 
and go mmm that's a little bit ugly

00:01:12.260 --> 00:01:14.270 
and go mmm that's a little bit ugly
obviously<00:01:13.260> when<00:01:13.409> you're<00:01:13.530> designing<00:01:13.799> any

00:01:14.270 --> 00:01:14.280 
obviously when you're designing any

00:01:14.280 --> 00:01:15.950 
obviously when you're designing any
smartphone<00:01:14.880> you're<00:01:15.150> gonna<00:01:15.360> be<00:01:15.509> limited<00:01:15.840> on

00:01:15.950 --> 00:01:15.960 
smartphone you're gonna be limited on

00:01:15.960 --> 00:01:17.899 
smartphone you're gonna be limited on
where<00:01:16.259> you<00:01:16.439> can<00:01:16.590> put<00:01:16.830> various<00:01:17.280> things<00:01:17.520> like

00:01:17.899 --> 00:01:17.909 
where you can put various things like

00:01:17.909 --> 00:01:19.789 
where you can put various things like
your<00:01:18.119> speaker's<00:01:18.509> without<00:01:19.110> them<00:01:19.350> making<00:01:19.590> the

00:01:19.789 --> 00:01:19.799 
your speaker's without them making the

00:01:19.799 --> 00:01:22.609 
your speaker's without them making the
device<00:01:20.299> potentially<00:01:21.299> bigger<00:01:21.659> longer<00:01:22.320> fatter

00:01:22.609 --> 00:01:22.619 
device potentially bigger longer fatter

00:01:22.619 --> 00:01:25.820 
device potentially bigger longer fatter
or<00:01:22.710> heavier<00:01:23.130> so<00:01:24.060> really<00:01:24.750> a<00:01:24.780> nice<00:01:25.170> trade-off

00:01:25.820 --> 00:01:25.830 
or heavier so really a nice trade-off

00:01:25.830 --> 00:01:27.710 
or heavier so really a nice trade-off
here<00:01:26.100> I<00:01:26.130> think<00:01:26.490> not<00:01:27.000> really<00:01:27.030> breaking<00:01:27.420> them

00:01:27.710 --> 00:01:27.720 
here I think not really breaking them

00:01:27.720 --> 00:01:29.690 
here I think not really breaking them
all<00:01:27.840> too<00:01:28.049> much<00:01:28.320> but<00:01:28.799> delivering<00:01:29.310> something

00:01:29.690 --> 00:01:29.700 
all too much but delivering something

00:01:29.700 --> 00:01:30.950 
all too much but delivering something
that<00:01:29.880> looks<00:01:30.150> good<00:01:30.270> and<00:01:30.600> you're<00:01:30.689> not<00:01:30.840> gonna

00:01:30.950 --> 00:01:30.960 
that looks good and you're not gonna

00:01:30.960 --> 00:01:32.450 
that looks good and you're not gonna
mind<00:01:31.200> taking<00:01:31.530> out<00:01:31.619> your<00:01:31.650> pocket<00:01:32.040> to<00:01:32.130> show<00:01:32.280> your

third<00:03:47.050> way<00:03:47.290> you<00:03:47.320> can<00:03:47.650> do<00:03:47.860> 3d<00:03:48.250> effects<00:03:48.850> you<00:03:49.210> can

00:03:49.320 --> 00:03:49.330 
third way you can do 3d effects you can

00:03:49.330 --> 00:03:50.850 
third way you can do 3d effects you can
do<00:03:49.480> a<00:03:49.510> parallax<00:03:49.930> barrier<00:03:50.170> on<00:03:50.470> a<00:03:50.500> set<00:03:50.710> of

00:03:50.850 --> 00:03:50.860 
do a parallax barrier on a set of

00:03:50.860 --> 00:03:53.100 
do a parallax barrier on a set of
glasses<00:03:51.070> in<00:03:51.580> do<00:03:51.730> a<00:03:51.760> parallax<00:03:52.060> barrier<00:03:52.270> on<00:03:52.540> an

00:03:53.100 --> 00:03:53.110 
glasses in do a parallax barrier on an

00:03:53.110 --> 00:03:56.190 
glasses in do a parallax barrier on an
actual<00:03:53.440> device<00:03:53.650> like<00:03:54.280> the<00:03:54.430> 3ds<00:03:54.760> or<00:03:55.180> you<00:03:56.020> can

00:03:56.190 --> 00:03:56.200 
actual device like the 3ds or you can

00:03:56.200 --> 00:03:58.410 
actual device like the 3ds or you can
use<00:03:56.410> two<00:03:56.980> stereo<00:03:57.640> cameras<00:03:58.120> with<00:03:58.270> infrared

00:03:58.410 --> 00:03:58.420 
use two stereo cameras with infrared

00:03:58.420 --> 00:04:00.960 
use two stereo cameras with infrared
built<00:03:58.900> into<00:03:59.230> them<00:03:59.410> measure<00:04:00.250> the<00:04:00.490> distance

00:04:00.960 --> 00:04:00.970 
built into them measure the distance

00:04:00.970 --> 00:04:04.020 
built into them measure the distance
between<00:04:01.180> the<00:04:01.960> person<00:04:02.410> and<00:04:02.500> the<00:04:02.730> actual<00:04:03.730> device

00:04:04.020 --> 00:04:04.030 
between the person and the actual device

00:04:04.030 --> 00:04:05.460 
between the person and the actual device
as<00:04:04.240> they're<00:04:04.390> holding<00:04:04.750> it<00:04:04.810> so<00:04:05.080> you<00:04:05.170> know<00:04:05.290> how

00:04:05.460 --> 00:04:05.470 
as they're holding it so you know how

00:04:05.470 --> 00:04:07.440 
as they're holding it so you know how
far<00:04:05.740> away<00:04:05.860> the<00:04:06.040> phone<00:04:06.340> is<00:04:06.520> effectively<00:04:07.210> from

00:04:07.440 --> 00:04:07.450 
far away the phone is effectively from

00:04:07.450 --> 00:04:10.290 
far away the phone is effectively from
the<00:04:07.630> face<00:04:07.810> and<00:04:08.220> using<00:04:09.220> that<00:04:09.310> information<00:04:09.520> you

00:04:10.290 --> 00:04:10.300 
the face and using that information you

00:04:10.300 --> 00:04:12.330 
the face and using that information you
can<00:04:10.450> create<00:04:10.690> an<00:04:10.930> extrusion<00:04:11.530> effectively

00:04:12.330 --> 00:04:12.340 
can create an extrusion effectively

00:04:12.340 --> 00:04:14.760 
can create an extrusion effectively
backwards<00:04:13.150> into<00:04:13.720> the<00:04:13.840> device<00:04:14.080> giving<00:04:14.680> you<00:04:14.740> a

00:04:14.760 --> 00:04:14.770 
backwards into the device giving you a

00:04:14.770 --> 00:04:17.070 
backwards into the device giving you a
depth<00:04:15.190> plane<00:04:15.640> and<00:04:16.120> this<00:04:16.239> effectively<00:04:16.780> allows

00:04:17.070 --> 00:04:17.080 
depth plane and this effectively allows

00:04:17.080 --> 00:04:19.430 
depth plane and this effectively allows
for<00:04:17.410> as<00:04:17.620> you're<00:04:17.860> going<00:04:18.040> to<00:04:18.160> see<00:04:18.370> in<00:04:18.460> a<00:04:18.520> moment<00:04:18.670> a

00:04:19.430 --> 00:04:19.440 
for as you're going to see in a moment a

00:04:19.440 --> 00:04:23.010 
for as you're going to see in a moment a
feeling<00:04:20.440> of<00:04:20.800> depth<00:04:21.630> something<00:04:22.630> we've<00:04:22.780> not

00:04:23.010 --> 00:04:23.020 
feeling of depth something we've not

00:04:23.020 --> 00:04:25.680 
feeling of depth something we've not
really<00:04:23.410> had<00:04:23.530> on<00:04:23.920> a<00:04:23.950> smartphone<00:04:24.370> before<00:04:24.970> we've

00:04:25.680 --> 00:04:25.690 
really had on a smartphone before we've

00:04:25.690 --> 00:04:27.960 
really had on a smartphone before we've
seen<00:04:26.020> these<00:04:26.260> techniques<00:04:26.800> done<00:04:27.100> in<00:04:27.310> kind<00:04:27.880> of

they've taken it and put it into their

00:04:59.680 --> 00:05:02.190 
they've taken it and put it into their
SDK<00:05:00.190> as<00:05:00.340> well<00:05:00.520> so<00:05:00.940> game<00:05:01.210> developers<00:05:01.780> can

00:05:02.190 --> 00:05:02.200 
SDK as well so game developers can

00:05:02.200 --> 00:05:05.130 
SDK as well so game developers can
create<00:05:02.470> a<00:05:02.500> new<00:05:02.860> dimension<00:05:03.430> on<00:05:04.060> their<00:05:04.540> games<00:05:04.900> as

00:05:05.130 --> 00:05:05.140 
create a new dimension on their games as

00:05:05.140 --> 00:05:07.140 
create a new dimension on their games as
you<00:05:05.410> can<00:05:05.560> see<00:05:05.740> there<00:05:06.040> by<00:05:06.490> tilting<00:05:06.850> the<00:05:07.030> device

00:05:07.140 --> 00:05:07.150

00:05:07.150 --> 00:05:10.290 
you can see there by tilting the device
the<00:05:07.840> game's<00:05:08.230> plane<00:05:08.800> changes<00:05:09.670> as<00:05:09.820> well

00:05:10.290 --> 00:05:10.300 
the game's plane changes as well

00:05:10.300 --> 00:05:12.240 
the game's plane changes as well
now<00:05:10.660> it's<00:05:10.840> a<00:05:10.930> cute<00:05:11.260> little<00:05:11.350> feature<00:05:11.740> for<00:05:12.040> sure

00:05:12.240 --> 00:05:12.250 
now it's a cute little feature for sure

00:05:12.250 --> 00:05:14.730 
now it's a cute little feature for sure
but<00:05:12.700> it's<00:05:12.820> one<00:05:13.060> that's<00:05:13.270> bound<00:05:13.630> to<00:05:13.900> cause<00:05:14.140> quite

00:05:14.730 --> 00:05:14.740 
but it's one that's bound to cause quite

yes<00:05:29.530> we've<00:05:29.740> got<00:05:29.920> duo<00:05:30.520> cam<00:05:30.880> on<00:05:31.090> the<00:05:31.180> HTC<00:05:31.570> One<00:05:32.080> m8

00:05:32.460 --> 00:05:32.470 
yes we've got duo cam on the HTC One m8

00:05:32.470 --> 00:05:34.230 
yes we've got duo cam on the HTC One m8
but<00:05:32.890> as<00:05:33.070> I<00:05:33.190> pointed<00:05:33.370> out<00:05:33.640> when<00:05:33.820> that<00:05:33.940> launched

00:05:34.230 --> 00:05:34.240 
but as I pointed out when that launched

00:05:34.240 --> 00:05:36.720 
but as I pointed out when that launched
it<00:05:34.780> wasn't<00:05:35.380> actually<00:05:35.560> required<00:05:36.160> we<00:05:36.550> don't

00:05:36.720 --> 00:05:36.730 
it wasn't actually required we don't

00:05:36.730 --> 00:05:38.580 
it wasn't actually required we don't
need<00:05:36.970> a<00:05:37.030> second<00:05:37.600> camera<00:05:37.840> to<00:05:38.290> take<00:05:38.440> the

00:05:38.580 --> 00:05:38.590 
need a second camera to take the

00:05:38.590 --> 00:05:40.560 
need a second camera to take the
original<00:05:38.980> picture<00:05:39.430> what<00:05:39.820> you<00:05:39.910> need<00:05:40.090> to<00:05:40.240> do<00:05:40.390> is

00:05:40.560 --> 00:05:40.570 
original picture what you need to do is

00:05:40.570 --> 00:05:43.440 
original picture what you need to do is
use<00:05:40.750> software<00:05:41.410> algorithms<00:05:42.070> to<00:05:42.370> take<00:05:42.700> a<00:05:42.910> flat

00:05:43.440 --> 00:05:43.450 
use software algorithms to take a flat

00:05:43.450 --> 00:05:45.630 
use software algorithms to take a flat
image<00:05:43.780> and<00:05:43.960> add<00:05:44.320> that<00:05:44.620> depth<00:05:44.920> scan<00:05:45.100> extrusion

00:05:45.630 --> 00:05:45.640 
image and add that depth scan extrusion

00:05:45.640 --> 00:05:47.370 
image and add that depth scan extrusion
to<00:05:45.820> it<00:05:45.940> effectively<00:05:46.510> now<00:05:46.990> as<00:05:47.050> you<00:05:47.140> can<00:05:47.230> see

00:05:47.370 --> 00:05:47.380 
to it effectively now as you can see

00:05:47.380 --> 00:05:49.230 
to it effectively now as you can see
here<00:05:47.560> Amazon<00:05:47.890> you're<00:05:47.950> using<00:05:48.100> four<00:05:48.640> cameras

00:05:49.230 --> 00:05:49.240 
here Amazon you're using four cameras

00:05:49.240 --> 00:05:50.850 
here Amazon you're using four cameras
although<00:05:49.420> only<00:05:49.600> two<00:05:49.750> are<00:05:50.110> really<00:05:50.290> used<00:05:50.620> at<00:05:50.770> any

00:05:50.850 --> 00:05:50.860 
although only two are really used at any

00:05:50.860 --> 00:05:52.770 
although only two are really used at any
one<00:05:51.070> time<00:05:51.100> depending<00:05:52.000> on<00:05:52.030> the<00:05:52.090> orientation<00:05:52.300> of

one time depending on the orientation of
the<00:05:52.870> device<00:05:52.930> and<00:05:53.500> this<00:05:53.650> is<00:05:53.800> because<00:05:54.130> as<00:05:54.430> you

00:05:54.930 --> 00:05:54.940 
the device and this is because as you

when you turn on your device round

00:05:56.110 --> 00:05:57.930 
when you turn on your device round
you're<00:05:56.500> likely<00:05:56.740> to<00:05:57.010> cover<00:05:57.280> at<00:05:57.430> least<00:05:57.460> one<00:05:57.820> of

00:05:59.970 --> 00:05:59.980 
the cameras at any one time by doing it

00:05:59.980 --> 00:06:01.980 
the cameras at any one time by doing it
this<00:06:00.130> way<00:06:00.190> they've<00:06:00.880> always<00:06:01.090> got<00:06:01.420> two<00:06:01.630> cameras

00:06:01.980 --> 00:06:01.990 
this way they've always got two cameras

00:06:01.990 --> 00:06:03.900 
this way they've always got two cameras
able<00:06:02.350> to<00:06:02.440> point<00:06:02.560> at<00:06:02.710> your<00:06:02.830> face<00:06:03.040> they<00:06:03.670> also

00:06:03.900 --> 00:06:03.910 
able to point at your face they also

00:06:03.910 --> 00:06:06.120 
able to point at your face they also
aren't<00:06:04.360> using<00:06:04.570> a<00:06:04.750> rolling<00:06:05.140> shutter<00:06:05.170> style<00:06:06.010> of

aren't using a rolling shutter style of
system<00:06:06.490> here<00:06:06.700> to<00:06:06.820> take<00:06:07.180> the<00:06:07.330> images<00:06:07.600> that<00:06:07.780> were

system here to take the images that were

00:06:07.990 --> 00:06:09.060 
system here to take the images that were
basically<00:06:08.200> means<00:06:08.470> that<00:06:08.530> you're<00:06:08.740> dropping

00:06:09.060 --> 00:06:09.070 
basically means that you're dropping

00:06:09.070 --> 00:06:10.830 
basically means that you're dropping
like<00:06:09.160> a<00:06:09.220> digital<00:06:09.700> shutter<00:06:10.120> effectively<00:06:10.570> over

00:06:10.830 --> 00:06:10.840 
like a digital shutter effectively over

00:06:10.840 --> 00:06:12.240 
like a digital shutter effectively over
the<00:06:10.930> top<00:06:11.080> of<00:06:11.200> the<00:06:11.260> image<00:06:11.440> each<00:06:11.590> time<00:06:11.890> what

the top of the image each time what
they're<00:06:12.400> doing<00:06:12.550> is<00:06:12.640> using<00:06:12.790> global<00:06:13.120> now<00:06:13.630> that

00:06:13.740 --> 00:06:13.750 
they're doing is using global now that

00:06:13.750 --> 00:06:14.940 
they're doing is using global now that
basically<00:06:13.870> means<00:06:14.170> it's<00:06:14.290> just<00:06:14.410> constantly

00:06:14.940 --> 00:06:14.950 
basically means it's just constantly
