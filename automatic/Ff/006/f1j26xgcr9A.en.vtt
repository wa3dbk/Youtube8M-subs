my<00:00:07.640> name<00:00:07.790> is<00:00:07.880> Phil<00:00:08.059> Kaufman<00:00:08.300> I<00:00:08.630> had<00:00:08.930> surgery<00:00:09.230> on

00:00:09.460 --> 00:00:09.470 
my name is Phil Kaufman I had surgery on

00:00:09.470 --> 00:00:11.799 
my name is Phil Kaufman I had surgery on
my<00:00:09.680> shoulder<00:00:10.070> and<00:00:10.790> during<00:00:11.059> that<00:00:11.090> surgery<00:00:11.750> I

00:00:11.799 --> 00:00:11.809 
my shoulder and during that surgery I

00:00:11.809 --> 00:00:13.910 
my shoulder and during that surgery I
had<00:00:11.960> a<00:00:11.990> regional<00:00:12.170> blood

00:00:13.910 --> 00:00:13.920 
had a regional blood

00:00:13.920 --> 00:00:16.160 
had a regional blood
I<00:00:13.980> really<00:00:14.880> thought<00:00:15.090> that<00:00:15.300> it<00:00:15.480> managed<00:00:16.080> the

00:00:16.160 --> 00:00:16.170 
I really thought that it managed the

00:00:16.170 --> 00:00:18.230 
I really thought that it managed the
pain<00:00:16.380> for<00:00:16.620> me<00:00:16.740> very<00:00:17.010> well<00:00:17.250> I<00:00:17.460> definitely<00:00:17.760> felt

00:00:18.230 --> 00:00:18.240 
pain for me very well I definitely felt

00:00:18.240 --> 00:00:21.019 
pain for me very well I definitely felt
safe<00:00:18.540> with<00:00:18.840> the<00:00:19.320> procedure<00:00:19.710> it<00:00:20.100> really<00:00:20.400> did

00:00:21.019 --> 00:00:21.029 
safe with the procedure it really did

00:00:21.029 --> 00:00:23.970 
safe with the procedure it really did
work<00:00:21.180> wonderfully

00:00:23.970 --> 00:00:23.980 

00:00:23.980 --> 00:00:25.890 

a<00:00:24.010> nerve<00:00:24.670> block<00:00:24.820> is<00:00:25.060> an<00:00:25.180> injection<00:00:25.510> of<00:00:25.750> local

00:00:25.890 --> 00:00:25.900 
a nerve block is an injection of local

00:00:25.900 --> 00:00:28.050 
a nerve block is an injection of local
anesthetic<00:00:26.500> or<00:00:26.650> numbing<00:00:26.949> medication<00:00:27.189> the

00:00:28.050 --> 00:00:28.060 
anesthetic or numbing medication the

00:00:28.060 --> 00:00:29.999 
anesthetic or numbing medication the
injections<00:00:28.449> made<00:00:28.630> around<00:00:28.930> a<00:00:29.050> nerve<00:00:29.289> and<00:00:29.680> it

00:00:29.999 --> 00:00:30.009 
injections made around a nerve and it

00:00:30.009 --> 00:00:31.560 
injections made around a nerve and it
creates<00:00:30.369> numbness<00:00:30.730> in<00:00:31.000> the<00:00:31.090> certain<00:00:31.330> parts

00:00:31.560 --> 00:00:31.570 
creates numbness in the certain parts

00:00:31.570 --> 00:00:33.880 
creates numbness in the certain parts
body

00:00:33.880 --> 00:00:33.890 

00:00:33.890 --> 00:00:35.860 

there<00:00:34.520> are<00:00:34.610> two<00:00:34.760> types<00:00:35.000> of<00:00:35.120> nerve<00:00:35.300> blocks<00:00:35.570> a

00:00:35.860 --> 00:00:35.870 
there are two types of nerve blocks a

00:00:35.870 --> 00:00:37.600 
there are two types of nerve blocks a
single-shot<00:00:36.260> a<00:00:36.440> nerve<00:00:36.680> block<00:00:36.860> is<00:00:37.280> simply

00:00:37.600 --> 00:00:37.610 
single-shot a nerve block is simply

00:00:37.610 --> 00:00:39.520 
single-shot a nerve block is simply
injection<00:00:38.120> of<00:00:38.270> local<00:00:38.660> anesthetic<00:00:39.170> around<00:00:39.470> the

00:00:39.520 --> 00:00:39.530 
injection of local anesthetic around the

00:00:39.530 --> 00:00:41.650 
injection of local anesthetic around the
nerve<00:00:39.710> and<00:00:39.980> that<00:00:40.579> provides<00:00:40.879> pain<00:00:41.090> control<00:00:41.480> for

00:00:41.650 --> 00:00:41.660 
nerve and that provides pain control for

00:00:41.660 --> 00:00:44.260 
nerve and that provides pain control for
about<00:00:41.750> 18<00:00:42.230> hours<00:00:42.350> and<00:00:42.980> their<00:00:43.610> block<00:00:43.790> catheter

00:00:44.260 --> 00:00:44.270 
about 18 hours and their block catheter

00:00:44.270 --> 00:00:45.760 
about 18 hours and their block catheter
is<00:00:44.510> for<00:00:44.720> patients<00:00:45.050> that<00:00:45.079> are<00:00:45.230> having<00:00:45.260> surgery

00:00:45.760 --> 00:00:45.770 
is for patients that are having surgery

00:00:45.770 --> 00:00:47.889 
is for patients that are having surgery
that<00:00:46.160> requires<00:00:46.460> pain<00:00:47.120> control<00:00:47.420> for<00:00:47.660> two<00:00:47.780> to

00:00:47.889 --> 00:00:47.899 
that requires pain control for two to

00:00:47.899 --> 00:00:50.049 
that requires pain control for two to
three<00:00:47.930> days<00:00:48.110> we<00:00:48.980> use<00:00:49.129> a<00:00:49.160> non<00:00:49.430> key<00:00:49.670> nerve<00:00:49.850> block

00:00:50.049 --> 00:00:50.059 
three days we use a non key nerve block

00:00:50.059 --> 00:00:51.850 
three days we use a non key nerve block
catheter<00:00:50.480> for<00:00:50.690> a<00:00:50.720> variety<00:00:50.989> of<00:00:51.019> reasons<00:00:51.410> it's

00:00:51.850 --> 00:00:51.860 
catheter for a variety of reasons it's

00:00:51.860 --> 00:00:53.890 
catheter for a variety of reasons it's
small<00:00:52.190> it's<00:00:52.489> convenient<00:00:52.879> with<00:00:53.120> very<00:00:53.390> reliable

00:00:53.890 --> 00:00:53.900 
small it's convenient with very reliable

00:00:53.900 --> 00:00:56.860 
small it's convenient with very reliable
I<00:00:54.339> have<00:00:55.339> had<00:00:55.550> several<00:00:56.000> other<00:00:56.150> surgeries<00:00:56.629> and

00:00:56.860 --> 00:00:56.870 
I have had several other surgeries and

00:00:56.870 --> 00:00:58.869 
I have had several other surgeries and
usually<00:00:57.409> the<00:00:57.860> anesthesia<00:00:58.339> makes<00:00:58.760> you

00:00:58.869 --> 00:00:58.879 
usually the anesthesia makes you

00:00:58.879 --> 00:01:01.689 
usually the anesthesia makes you
extremely<00:00:59.480> groggy<00:01:00.100> what<00:01:01.100> I<00:01:01.129> really<00:01:01.489> liked

00:01:01.689 --> 00:01:01.699 
extremely groggy what I really liked

00:01:01.699 --> 00:01:03.189 
extremely groggy what I really liked
about<00:01:01.820> the<00:01:02.059> block<00:01:02.269> was<00:01:02.510> that<00:01:02.720> the<00:01:02.900> very<00:01:03.050> next

00:01:03.189 --> 00:01:03.199 
about the block was that the very next

00:01:03.199 --> 00:01:04.749 
about the block was that the very next
day<00:01:03.350> you<00:01:03.920> can<00:01:04.100> just<00:01:04.129> wear<00:01:04.369> it<00:01:04.460> around<00:01:04.519> your

00:01:04.749 --> 00:01:04.759 
day you can just wear it around your

00:01:04.759 --> 00:01:07.060 
day you can just wear it around your
neck<00:01:04.790> I<00:01:05.180> threw<00:01:05.810> mine<00:01:05.990> in<00:01:06.020> my<00:01:06.259> sling<00:01:06.590> so<00:01:06.890> that<00:01:07.009> I

00:01:07.060 --> 00:01:07.070 
neck I threw mine in my sling so that I

00:01:07.070 --> 00:01:09.580 
neck I threw mine in my sling so that I
could<00:01:07.250> go<00:01:07.520> for<00:01:07.700> a<00:01:07.759> walk<00:01:07.789> and<00:01:08.300> I<00:01:08.570> was<00:01:08.990> able<00:01:09.110> to<00:01:09.259> be

00:01:09.580 --> 00:01:09.590 
could go for a walk and I was able to be

00:01:09.590 --> 00:01:12.240 
could go for a walk and I was able to be
active<00:01:10.220> while<00:01:10.610> still<00:01:10.940> having<00:01:11.240> pain<00:01:11.360> relief<00:01:11.690> a

active while still having pain relief a

00:01:12.250 --> 00:01:15.070 
active while still having pain relief a
nerve<00:01:13.250> block<00:01:13.369> is<00:01:13.610> a<00:01:13.640> very<00:01:13.880> safe<00:01:14.119> procedure<00:01:14.270> we

00:01:15.070 --> 00:01:15.080 
nerve block is a very safe procedure we

00:01:15.080 --> 00:01:16.630 
nerve block is a very safe procedure we
actually<00:01:15.440> use<00:01:15.560> ultrasound<00:01:16.039> guidance<00:01:16.399> for<00:01:16.580> all
