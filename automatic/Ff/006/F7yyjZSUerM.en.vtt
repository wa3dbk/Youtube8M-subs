00:00:24.140 --> 00:00:24.150 
out let me show you what the aerator

00:00:24.150 --> 00:00:26.570 
out let me show you what the aerator
looks<00:00:24.359> like<00:00:24.539> we've<00:00:25.140> already<00:00:25.430> aerated<00:00:26.430> this

00:00:26.570 --> 00:00:26.580 
looks like we've already aerated this

00:00:26.580 --> 00:00:30.050 
looks like we've already aerated this
long<00:00:27.650> aerator<00:00:28.650> has<00:00:28.859> these<00:00:29.010> tines<00:00:29.340> on<00:00:29.640> it<00:00:29.789> and

00:00:30.050 --> 00:00:30.060 
long aerator has these tines on it and

00:00:30.060 --> 00:00:31.490 
long aerator has these tines on it and
what<00:00:30.269> it<00:00:30.390> does<00:00:30.420> this<00:00:30.869> thing<00:00:31.080> rolls<00:00:31.349> around

00:00:31.490 --> 00:00:31.500 
what it does this thing rolls around

00:00:31.500 --> 00:00:34.490 
what it does this thing rolls around
it's<00:00:31.980> weighted<00:00:32.399> down<00:00:32.610> it<00:00:33.270> has<00:00:33.480> a<00:00:33.510> weight<00:00:34.200> right

00:00:34.490 --> 00:00:34.500 
it's weighted down it has a weight right

00:00:34.500 --> 00:00:36.799 
it's weighted down it has a weight right
there<00:00:34.530> and<00:00:35.100> also<00:00:35.550> this<00:00:35.730> wheel<00:00:36.059> in<00:00:36.420> the<00:00:36.570> front

00:00:36.799 --> 00:00:36.809 
there and also this wheel in the front

00:00:36.809 --> 00:00:38.360 
there and also this wheel in the front
of<00:00:36.930> it<00:00:37.020> is<00:00:37.170> filled<00:00:37.440> with<00:00:37.530> water<00:00:37.800> to<00:00:38.070> weight<00:00:38.219> it

00:00:38.360 --> 00:00:38.370 
of it is filled with water to weight it

00:00:38.370 --> 00:00:43.720 
of it is filled with water to weight it
down<00:00:38.690> so<00:00:39.690> as<00:00:39.840> this<00:00:39.989> thing<00:00:40.050> rolls<00:00:40.559> forward<00:00:41.010> it

00:00:43.720 --> 00:00:43.730 

00:00:43.730 --> 00:00:46.700 

it<00:00:44.780> mechanically<00:00:45.780> moves<00:00:46.079> around<00:00:46.170> and<00:00:46.500> round

00:00:46.700 --> 00:00:46.710 
it mechanically moves around and round

00:00:46.710 --> 00:00:49.549 
it mechanically moves around and round
each<00:00:46.890> and<00:00:47.250> punches<00:00:47.940> these<00:00:48.090> holes<00:00:48.360> in<00:00:48.570> the

00:00:49.549 --> 00:00:49.559 
each and punches these holes in the

00:00:49.559 --> 00:00:51.799 
each and punches these holes in the
ground<00:00:49.739> and<00:00:50.100> as<00:00:50.760> it<00:00:50.940> punches<00:00:51.239> them<00:00:51.449> it<00:00:51.510> punches

00:00:51.799 --> 00:00:51.809 
ground and as it punches them it punches

00:00:51.809 --> 00:00:54.170 
ground and as it punches them it punches
out<00:00:51.989> the<00:00:52.320> the<00:00:52.649> old<00:00:52.890> dirt<00:00:53.190> which<00:00:53.489> you'll<00:00:53.699> see

00:00:54.170 --> 00:00:54.180 
out the the old dirt which you'll see

00:00:54.180 --> 00:00:55.580 
out the the old dirt which you'll see
several<00:00:54.420> of<00:00:54.629> those<00:00:54.750> little<00:00:55.079> things<00:00:55.230> laying

00:00:55.580 --> 00:00:55.590 
several of those little things laying

00:00:55.590 --> 00:00:58.160 
several of those little things laying
around<00:00:55.770> so<00:00:56.610> what<00:00:56.969> you<00:00:57.120> got<00:00:57.360> is<00:00:57.600> it<00:00:57.719> aerated

00:00:58.160 --> 00:00:58.170 
around so what you got is it aerated

00:00:58.170 --> 00:01:00.979 
around so what you got is it aerated
long<00:00:58.379> now<00:00:58.620> this<00:00:58.800> does<00:00:59.280> several<00:00:59.579> things<00:00:59.989> it

00:01:00.979 --> 00:01:00.989 
long now this does several things it

00:01:00.989 --> 00:01:03.680 
long now this does several things it
loosens<00:01:01.410> up<00:01:01.559> compacted<00:01:02.160> soil<00:01:02.460> it's<00:01:03.449> going<00:01:03.629> to

00:01:03.680 --> 00:01:03.690 
loosens up compacted soil it's going to

00:01:03.690 --> 00:01:05.539 
loosens up compacted soil it's going to
put<00:01:03.870> holes<00:01:04.110> down<00:01:04.379> in<00:01:04.530> the<00:01:04.589> ground<00:01:04.739> which<00:01:05.369> when

00:01:05.539 --> 00:01:05.549 
put holes down in the ground which when

00:01:05.549 --> 00:01:08.060 
put holes down in the ground which when
I<00:01:05.580> spread<00:01:05.939> the<00:01:06.090> seed<00:01:06.360> in<00:01:06.659> a<00:01:06.720> moment<00:01:07.070> over

00:01:08.060 --> 00:01:08.070 
I spread the seed in a moment over

00:01:08.070 --> 00:01:10.330 
I spread the seed in a moment over
here's<00:01:08.400> the<00:01:08.460> seed<00:01:08.820> that<00:01:08.850> we're<00:01:09.180> gonna<00:01:09.270> use

00:01:10.330 --> 00:01:10.340 
here's the seed that we're gonna use

00:01:10.340 --> 00:01:12.710 
here's the seed that we're gonna use
we're<00:01:11.340> gonna<00:01:11.460> spread<00:01:11.729> the<00:01:11.880> seed<00:01:12.150> it's<00:01:12.540> gonna

00:01:12.710 --> 00:01:12.720 
we're gonna spread the seed it's gonna

00:01:12.720 --> 00:01:17.090 
we're gonna spread the seed it's gonna
go<00:01:12.900> down<00:01:13.320> into<00:01:13.560> the<00:01:13.950> holes<00:01:14.450> so<00:01:15.560> that<00:01:16.560> that

00:01:17.090 --> 00:01:17.100 
go down into the holes so that that

00:01:17.100 --> 00:01:19.039 
go down into the holes so that that
provides<00:01:17.729> first<00:01:18.030> for<00:01:18.330> the<00:01:18.420> seed<00:01:18.630> to<00:01:18.780> go<00:01:18.900> down

00:01:19.039 --> 00:01:19.049 
provides first for the seed to go down

00:01:19.049 --> 00:01:20.630 
provides first for the seed to go down
in<00:01:19.259> when<00:01:19.530> I<00:01:19.560> spread<00:01:19.860> it<00:01:19.920> the<00:01:20.100> seeds<00:01:20.340> gonna<00:01:20.549> go

00:01:20.630 --> 00:01:20.640 
in when I spread it the seeds gonna go

00:01:20.640 --> 00:01:22.700 
in when I spread it the seeds gonna go
down<00:01:20.820> in<00:01:20.939> the<00:01:21.000> holes<00:01:21.210> and<00:01:21.420> also<00:01:21.900> you're<00:01:22.560> gonna

00:01:22.700 --> 00:01:22.710 
down in the holes and also you're gonna

00:01:22.710 --> 00:01:24.590 
down in the holes and also you're gonna
have<00:01:22.950> fertilizer<00:01:23.790> I'm<00:01:24.180> gonna<00:01:24.330> spread

aerate use your spreader here and spread
the<00:01:30.900> seed<00:01:31.200> and<00:01:31.500> then<00:01:31.950> the<00:01:32.100> fertilizer<00:01:32.810> if<00:01:33.810> you

00:01:33.950 --> 00:01:33.960 
the seed and then the fertilizer if you

00:01:33.960 --> 00:01:36.260 
the seed and then the fertilizer if you
notice<00:01:34.200> this<00:01:34.290> start<00:01:34.770> of<00:01:34.890> fertilizer<00:01:35.280> you<00:01:36.000> have

00:01:36.260 --> 00:01:36.270 
notice this start of fertilizer you have

00:01:36.270 --> 00:01:40.420 
notice this start of fertilizer you have
three<00:01:37.140> numbers<00:01:37.500> on<00:01:37.619> fertilizer<00:01:38.299> nitrogen<00:01:39.299> by

00:01:40.420 --> 00:01:40.430 
three numbers on fertilizer nitrogen by

00:01:40.430 --> 00:01:44.060 
three numbers on fertilizer nitrogen by
phosphate<00:01:41.430> and<00:01:42.119> potassium<00:01:42.799> when<00:01:43.799> you<00:01:43.890> have<00:01:44.040> a

00:01:44.060 --> 00:01:44.070 
phosphate and potassium when you have a

00:01:44.070 --> 00:01:46.670 
phosphate and potassium when you have a
high<00:01:44.340> second<00:01:44.909> number<00:01:45.210> phosphate<00:01:45.960> that's<00:01:46.439> what

00:01:46.670 --> 00:01:46.680 
high second number phosphate that's what

00:01:46.680 --> 00:01:48.020 
high second number phosphate that's what
you<00:01:46.770> want<00:01:46.920> for<00:01:47.040> starter<00:01:47.369> fertilizer<00:01:47.759> because

00:01:48.020 --> 00:01:48.030 
you want for starter fertilizer because

00:01:48.030 --> 00:01:49.460 
you want for starter fertilizer because
that's<00:01:48.180> really<00:01:48.420> good<00:01:48.659> for<00:01:48.840> the<00:01:48.899> root<00:01:49.079> system

00:01:49.460 --> 00:01:49.470 
that's really good for the root system

00:01:49.470 --> 00:01:52.840 
that's really good for the root system
so<00:01:49.619> we're<00:01:50.070> using<00:01:50.220> starter<00:01:50.670> fertilizer<00:01:51.409> seed

00:01:52.840 --> 00:01:52.850 
so we're using starter fertilizer seed

00:01:52.850 --> 00:01:57.050 
so we're using starter fertilizer seed
my<00:01:53.850> lawn<00:01:54.509> is<00:01:54.720> fescue<00:01:55.200> and<00:01:56.130> the<00:01:56.460> best<00:01:56.670> time<00:01:56.850> to

00:01:57.050 --> 00:01:57.060 
my lawn is fescue and the best time to

00:01:57.060 --> 00:01:58.880 
my lawn is fescue and the best time to
seed<00:01:57.299> but<00:01:57.540> if<00:01:57.689> the<00:01:57.840> fescue<00:01:58.140> again<00:01:58.530> is<00:01:58.680> in<00:01:58.799> the

00:01:58.880 --> 00:01:58.890 
seed but if the fescue again is in the

00:01:58.890 --> 00:02:01.819 
seed but if the fescue again is in the
fall<00:01:59.070> with<00:01:59.490> a<00:01:59.729> narrator<00:02:00.390> so<00:02:00.960> gonna<00:02:01.229> first

00:02:01.819 --> 00:02:01.829 
fall with a narrator so gonna first

00:02:01.829 --> 00:02:03.260 
fall with a narrator so gonna first
you're<00:02:02.009> going<00:02:02.159> to<00:02:02.219> do<00:02:02.310> is<00:02:02.399> mow<00:02:02.640> the<00:02:02.790> yard<00:02:02.820> down

00:02:03.260 --> 00:02:03.270 
you're going to do is mow the yard down

00:02:03.270 --> 00:02:05.480 
you're going to do is mow the yard down
real<00:02:03.750> low<00:02:03.890> then<00:02:04.890> aerate<00:02:05.340> it

00:02:05.480 --> 00:02:05.490 
real low then aerate it

00:02:05.490 --> 00:02:07.940 
real low then aerate it
if<00:02:05.820> you<00:02:05.939> mow<00:02:06.090> it<00:02:06.119> down<00:02:06.240> real<00:02:06.630> low<00:02:06.659> what<00:02:07.649> happens

00:02:07.940 --> 00:02:07.950 
if you mow it down real low what happens

00:02:07.950 --> 00:02:09.410 
if you mow it down real low what happens
is<00:02:08.099> the<00:02:08.310> seed<00:02:08.489> has<00:02:08.670> a<00:02:08.700> better<00:02:08.940> chance<00:02:09.000> of

00:02:09.410 --> 00:02:09.420 
is the seed has a better chance of

00:02:09.420 --> 00:02:11.300 
is the seed has a better chance of
making<00:02:09.780> into<00:02:10.229> the<00:02:10.319> holes

00:02:11.300 --> 00:02:11.310 
making into the holes

00:02:11.310 --> 00:02:14.510 
making into the holes
so<00:02:11.490> we're<00:02:12.300> gonna<00:02:12.450> spread<00:02:12.810> the<00:02:12.959> seed<00:02:13.520> spread

00:02:14.510 --> 00:02:14.520 
so we're gonna spread the seed spread

00:02:14.520 --> 00:02:16.880 
so we're gonna spread the seed spread
the<00:02:14.640> fertilizer<00:02:14.790> and<00:02:15.450> another<00:02:16.110> thing<00:02:16.350> I'm<00:02:16.530> not

00:02:16.880 --> 00:02:16.890 
the fertilizer and another thing I'm not

00:02:16.890 --> 00:02:18.350 
the fertilizer and another thing I'm not
spreading<00:02:17.160> it<00:02:17.370> today<00:02:17.640> but<00:02:17.700> a<00:02:17.910> good<00:02:18.090> thing<00:02:18.240> to

00:02:18.350 --> 00:02:18.360 
spreading it today but a good thing to

00:02:18.360 --> 00:02:23.660 
spreading it today but a good thing to
do<00:02:18.480> is<00:02:18.569> also<00:02:18.750> to<00:02:18.959> spread<00:02:20.150> spread<00:02:21.150> oh<00:02:22.550> shoot<00:02:23.550> I

00:02:23.660 --> 00:02:23.670 
do is also to spread spread oh shoot I

00:02:23.670 --> 00:02:24.559 
do is also to spread spread oh shoot I
can't<00:02:23.880> think<00:02:24.150> right<00:02:24.240> now

00:02:24.559 --> 00:02:24.569 
can't think right now

00:02:24.569 --> 00:02:26.809 
can't think right now
lime<00:02:24.950> there's<00:02:25.950> two<00:02:26.040> different<00:02:26.160> types<00:02:26.340> of<00:02:26.640> one

00:02:26.809 --> 00:02:26.819 
lime there's two different types of one

00:02:26.819 --> 00:02:29.210 
lime there's two different types of one
lime<00:02:27.630> comes<00:02:28.290> either<00:02:28.530> and<00:02:28.620> it's<00:02:28.739> powder<00:02:28.980> or

00:02:29.210 --> 00:02:29.220 
lime comes either and it's powder or

00:02:29.220 --> 00:02:31.729 
lime comes either and it's powder or
pellets<00:02:29.430> I've<00:02:29.730> used<00:02:29.910> both<00:02:30.180> I<00:02:30.930> prefer<00:02:31.590> the

00:02:31.729 --> 00:02:31.739 
pellets I've used both I prefer the

00:02:31.739 --> 00:02:34.070 
pellets I've used both I prefer the
pellets<00:02:32.130> because<00:02:32.459> when<00:02:32.910> you<00:02:33.000> spread<00:02:33.330> it<00:02:33.390> if

00:02:34.070 --> 00:02:34.080 
pellets because when you spread it if

00:02:34.080 --> 00:02:35.750 
pellets because when you spread it if
you<00:02:34.170> use<00:02:34.319> the<00:02:34.500> powder<00:02:34.709> it's<00:02:35.010> like<00:02:35.190> flour<00:02:35.550> I

00:02:35.750 --> 00:02:35.760 
you use the powder it's like flour I

00:02:35.760 --> 00:02:37.580 
you use the powder it's like flour I
mean<00:02:36.060> it<00:02:36.270> goes<00:02:36.450> everywhere<00:02:36.780> and<00:02:37.050> makes<00:02:37.230> a<00:02:37.319> mess

00:02:37.580 --> 00:02:37.590 
mean it goes everywhere and makes a mess

00:02:37.590 --> 00:02:40.490 
mean it goes everywhere and makes a mess
so<00:02:38.130> the<00:02:38.610> pellets<00:02:38.970> are<00:02:39.090> usually<00:02:39.330> the<00:02:39.450> best<00:02:39.600> now

00:02:40.490 --> 00:02:40.500 
so the pellets are usually the best now

00:02:40.500 --> 00:02:43.220 
so the pellets are usually the best now
one<00:02:40.860> option<00:02:41.400> you<00:02:41.640> can<00:02:42.000> also<00:02:42.060> do<00:02:42.510> before<00:02:42.900> you<00:02:43.080> go

00:02:43.220 --> 00:02:43.230 
one option you can also do before you go

00:02:43.230 --> 00:02:44.540 
one option you can also do before you go
through<00:02:43.470> this<00:02:43.650> aeration<00:02:44.280> and<00:02:44.310> seeding

00:02:44.540 --> 00:02:44.550 
through this aeration and seeding

00:02:44.550 --> 00:02:47.570 
through this aeration and seeding
process<00:02:45.030> if<00:02:45.810> you<00:02:45.959> have<00:02:46.200> some<00:02:46.560> junk<00:02:47.430> in<00:02:47.550> your

00:02:47.570 --> 00:02:47.580 
process if you have some junk in your

00:02:47.580 --> 00:02:49.910 
process if you have some junk in your
lawn<00:02:47.880> like<00:02:48.120> I<00:02:48.269> do<00:02:48.330> Bermuda<00:02:48.959> grass<00:02:49.230> that<00:02:49.530> sneaks

00:02:49.910 --> 00:02:49.920 
lawn like I do Bermuda grass that sneaks

00:02:49.920 --> 00:02:52.009 
lawn like I do Bermuda grass that sneaks
into<00:02:50.130> it<00:02:50.370> what<00:02:51.060> we're<00:02:51.239> gonna<00:02:51.360> do<00:02:51.600> is<00:02:51.720> get<00:02:51.870> some

00:02:52.009 --> 00:02:52.019 
into it what we're gonna do is get some

00:02:52.019 --> 00:02:54.199 
into it what we're gonna do is get some
roundup<00:02:52.560> there's<00:02:53.310> a<00:02:53.459> roundup<00:02:53.790> thing<00:02:54.030> over

kill<00:03:37.960> that<00:03:37.990> Bermuda<00:03:38.500> grass<00:03:39.360> because<00:03:40.360> it

00:03:40.560 --> 00:03:40.570 
kill that Bermuda grass because it

00:03:40.570 --> 00:03:43.440 
kill that Bermuda grass because it
really<00:03:41.050> is<00:03:41.110> an<00:03:41.230> enemy<00:03:41.500> to<00:03:41.530> fescue<00:03:42.330> spray<00:03:43.330> the

00:03:43.440 --> 00:03:43.450 
really is an enemy to fescue spray the

00:03:43.450 --> 00:03:45.260 
really is an enemy to fescue spray the
roundup<00:03:43.840> on<00:03:43.990> it<00:03:44.170> to<00:03:44.260> kill<00:03:44.410> it

00:03:45.260 --> 00:03:45.270 
roundup on it to kill it

00:03:45.270 --> 00:03:49.520 
roundup on it to kill it
mow<00:03:46.270> the<00:03:46.330> lawn<00:03:46.600> down<00:03:46.810> really<00:03:47.200> low<00:03:48.450> aerate<00:03:49.450> it

00:03:49.520 --> 00:03:49.530 
mow the lawn down really low aerate it

00:03:49.530 --> 00:03:52.680 
mow the lawn down really low aerate it
spread<00:03:50.530> seed<00:03:50.890> spread<00:03:51.850> starter<00:03:52.270> fertilizer

00:03:52.680 --> 00:03:52.690 
spread seed spread starter fertilizer

00:03:52.690 --> 00:03:55.470 
spread seed spread starter fertilizer
and<00:03:53.080> if<00:03:53.320> you<00:03:53.440> remember<00:03:53.830> second<00:03:54.760> number<00:03:55.000> on<00:03:55.390> the

00:03:55.470 --> 00:03:55.480 
and if you remember second number on the

00:03:55.480 --> 00:03:57.540 
and if you remember second number on the
three<00:03:55.720> numbers<00:03:55.870> is<00:03:56.110> the<00:03:56.140> high<00:03:56.550> phosphate

00:03:57.540 --> 00:03:57.550 
three numbers is the high phosphate

00:03:57.550 --> 00:03:59.490 
three numbers is the high phosphate
number<00:03:57.880> to<00:03:58.030> start<00:03:58.270> a<00:03:58.330> fertilizer<00:03:58.690> and<00:03:59.170> then

00:03:59.490 --> 00:03:59.500 
number to start a fertilizer and then

00:03:59.500 --> 00:04:03.750 
number to start a fertilizer and then
spread<00:03:59.830> lime<00:04:00.070> and<00:04:01.350> water<00:04:02.350> your<00:04:02.590> lawn<00:04:02.770> or<00:04:02.830> you

00:04:03.750 --> 00:04:03.760 
spread lime and water your lawn or you

00:04:03.760 --> 00:04:06.390 
spread lime and water your lawn or you
know<00:04:03.880> rains<00:04:04.330> on<00:04:04.570> it<00:04:04.600> it'll<00:04:04.870> be<00:04:04.989> good<00:04:05.170> to<00:04:05.200> go<00:04:05.440> the

00:04:06.390 --> 00:04:06.400 
know rains on it it'll be good to go the

00:04:06.400 --> 00:04:08.400 
know rains on it it'll be good to go the
reason<00:04:06.670> the<00:04:06.760> fall<00:04:06.970> is<00:04:07.180> such<00:04:07.360> a<00:04:07.390> good<00:04:07.600> time<00:04:07.840> is

00:04:08.400 --> 00:04:08.410 
reason the fall is such a good time is

00:04:08.410 --> 00:04:10.590 
reason the fall is such a good time is
because<00:04:08.920> fescue<00:04:09.670> is<00:04:09.700> a<00:04:09.820> cool<00:04:10.060> season<00:04:10.270> grass

00:04:10.590 --> 00:04:10.600 
because fescue is a cool season grass

00:04:10.600 --> 00:04:12.630 
because fescue is a cool season grass
that<00:04:11.470> means<00:04:11.680> that<00:04:11.800> it<00:04:11.890> does<00:04:12.010> best<00:04:12.250> between

00:04:12.630 --> 00:04:12.640 
that means that it does best between

00:04:12.640 --> 00:04:15.479 
that means that it does best between
sixty<00:04:13.030> and<00:04:13.060> eighty<00:04:13.709> and<00:04:14.709> it<00:04:14.830> goes<00:04:14.980> dormant<00:04:15.220> the

00:04:15.479 --> 00:04:15.489 
sixty and eighty and it goes dormant the

00:04:15.489 --> 00:04:17.430 
sixty and eighty and it goes dormant the
winter<00:04:15.790> it<00:04:16.359> really<00:04:16.660> has<00:04:16.780> a<00:04:16.810> hard<00:04:17.019> time<00:04:17.230> when<00:04:17.350> it

00:04:17.430 --> 00:04:17.440 
winter it really has a hard time when it

00:04:17.440 --> 00:04:20.640 
winter it really has a hard time when it
gets<00:04:17.560> up<00:04:17.680> into<00:04:17.829> the<00:04:18.040> 90s<00:04:18.489> so<00:04:19.000> if<00:04:19.810> you<00:04:19.959> seed<00:04:20.260> in

00:04:20.640 --> 00:04:20.650 
gets up into the 90s so if you seed in

00:04:20.650 --> 00:04:23.850 
gets up into the 90s so if you seed in
the<00:04:21.370> fall<00:04:21.940> it<00:04:22.810> has<00:04:22.960> enough<00:04:23.229> time<00:04:23.410> to<00:04:23.560> get<00:04:23.680> up

00:04:23.850 --> 00:04:23.860 
the fall it has enough time to get up

00:04:23.860 --> 00:04:26.070 
the fall it has enough time to get up
get<00:04:24.190> going<00:04:24.610> get<00:04:24.940> a<00:04:25.000> root<00:04:25.210> system<00:04:25.419> going<00:04:25.930> and

00:04:26.070 --> 00:04:26.080 
get going get a root system going and

00:04:26.080 --> 00:04:28.080 
get going get a root system going and
then<00:04:26.229> it<00:04:26.350> has<00:04:26.500> the<00:04:26.740> next<00:04:27.070> spring<00:04:27.400> to<00:04:27.700> continue

00:04:28.080 --> 00:04:28.090 
then it has the next spring to continue

00:04:28.090 --> 00:04:29.870 
then it has the next spring to continue
to<00:04:28.180> grow<00:04:28.330> and<00:04:28.479> be<00:04:28.540> mature<00:04:28.750> before<00:04:29.260> that<00:04:29.410> really

00:04:29.870 --> 00:04:29.880 
to grow and be mature before that really

00:04:29.880 --> 00:04:33.150 
to grow and be mature before that really
hard<00:04:30.880> hot<00:04:31.450> summer<00:04:31.780> sets<00:04:32.169> in<00:04:32.350> now<00:04:32.530> some<00:04:33.070> people

00:04:33.150 --> 00:04:33.160 
hard hot summer sets in now some people

00:04:33.160 --> 00:04:36.300 
hard hot summer sets in now some people
might<00:04:33.780> aerate<00:04:34.780> and<00:04:34.990> seed<00:04:35.260> in<00:04:35.530> the<00:04:35.620> spring<00:04:36.010> and

00:04:36.300 --> 00:04:36.310 
might aerate and seed in the spring and

00:04:36.310 --> 00:04:39.300 
might aerate and seed in the spring and
the<00:04:37.300> only<00:04:37.450> problem<00:04:37.690> that<00:04:37.870> is<00:04:38.200> that<00:04:38.830> grass

00:04:39.300 --> 00:04:39.310 
the only problem that is that grass

00:04:39.310 --> 00:04:40.740 
the only problem that is that grass
doesn't<00:04:39.610> have<00:04:39.820> a<00:04:39.850> whole<00:04:40.060> lot<00:04:40.270> of<00:04:40.300> time<00:04:40.570> to

00:04:40.740 --> 00:04:40.750 
doesn't have a whole lot of time to

00:04:40.750 --> 00:04:42.990 
doesn't have a whole lot of time to
mature<00:04:41.110> the<00:04:41.680> root<00:04:42.040> systems<00:04:42.430> become<00:04:42.700> strong

00:04:42.990 --> 00:04:43.000 
mature the root systems become strong

00:04:43.000 --> 00:04:45.600 
mature the root systems become strong
before<00:04:43.270> we're<00:04:43.540> really<00:04:43.750> into<00:04:44.110> that<00:04:44.260> hot<00:04:44.610> 90

00:04:45.600 --> 00:04:45.610 
before we're really into that hot 90

00:04:45.610 --> 00:04:47.760 
before we're really into that hot 90
degree<00:04:45.880> which<00:04:46.060> really<00:04:46.450> puts<00:04:46.720> a<00:04:46.900> lot<00:04:47.080> of<00:04:47.110> stress

00:04:47.760 --> 00:04:47.770 
degree which really puts a lot of stress

00:04:47.770 --> 00:04:50.850 
degree which really puts a lot of stress
