evasion seven down in the description

00:01:17.220 --> 00:01:19.249 
evasion seven down in the description
you<00:01:17.520> can<00:01:17.580> download<00:01:17.909> it<00:01:18.150> for<00:01:18.330> Windows<00:01:18.750> or<00:01:19.049> Mac

and open up evasion 7 and then as you

00:01:25.950 --> 00:01:27.710 
and open up evasion 7 and then as you
can<00:01:26.070> see<00:01:26.159> it<00:01:26.280> detected<00:01:26.729> my<00:01:26.850> device<00:01:27.119> the<00:01:27.360> iPhone

00:01:27.710 --> 00:01:27.720 
can see it detected my device the iPhone

00:01:27.720 --> 00:01:31.670 
can see it detected my device the iPhone
5c<00:01:28.290> and<00:01:28.500> it's<00:01:29.070> running<00:01:29.250> iOS<00:01:30.110> 7.0.4<00:01:31.110> I<00:01:31.380> would

00:01:31.670 --> 00:01:31.680 
5c and it's running iOS 7.0.4 I would

00:01:31.680 --> 00:01:33.679 
5c and it's running iOS 7.0.4 I would
recommend<00:01:32.070> probably<00:01:32.310> being<00:01:32.610> I'm<00:01:33.119> the<00:01:33.390> latest

00:01:33.679 --> 00:01:33.689 
recommend probably being I'm the latest

00:01:33.689 --> 00:01:35.090 
recommend probably being I'm the latest
firmware<00:01:33.900> as<00:01:34.259> that's<00:01:34.470> probably<00:01:34.770> the<00:01:34.890> best

00:01:35.090 --> 00:01:35.100 
firmware as that's probably the best

00:01:35.100 --> 00:01:37.490 
firmware as that's probably the best
idea<00:01:35.759> to<00:01:35.850> do<00:01:36.150> that<00:01:36.180> but<00:01:36.810> anyways<00:01:37.079> all<00:01:37.290> you<00:01:37.320> got

00:01:37.490 --> 00:01:37.500 
idea to do that but anyways all you got

00:01:37.500 --> 00:01:38.690 
idea to do that but anyways all you got
to<00:01:37.619> do<00:01:37.710> is<00:01:37.860> just<00:01:37.890> go<00:01:38.130> ahead<00:01:38.159> and<00:01:38.430> click<00:01:38.579> on

00:01:38.690 --> 00:01:38.700 
to do is just go ahead and click on

00:01:38.700 --> 00:01:40.219 
to do is just go ahead and click on
jailbreak<00:01:39.150> now<00:01:39.689> I'm<00:01:39.750> gonna<00:01:39.900> go<00:01:39.990> ahead<00:01:40.110> and

00:01:40.219 --> 00:01:40.229 
jailbreak now I'm gonna go ahead and

00:01:40.229 --> 00:01:41.840 
jailbreak now I'm gonna go ahead and
speed<00:01:40.590> this<00:01:40.770> part<00:01:41.040> up<00:01:41.189> because<00:01:41.490> this<00:01:41.640> will

00:01:41.840 --> 00:01:41.850 
speed this part up because this will

00:01:41.850 --> 00:01:42.980 
speed this part up because this will
take<00:01:42.030> some<00:01:42.210> time<00:01:42.240> it's<00:01:42.570> probably<00:01:42.810> gonna<00:01:42.899> take

00:01:42.980 --> 00:01:42.990 
take some time it's probably gonna take

00:01:42.990 --> 00:01:45.050 
take some time it's probably gonna take
about<00:01:43.140> 10<00:01:43.560> minutes<00:01:43.590> for<00:01:44.220> you<00:01:44.310> to<00:01:44.340> jailbreak

00:01:45.050 --> 00:01:45.060 
about 10 minutes for you to jailbreak
