00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.080
 they said that there is a cristino is also 

00:00:05.009 --> 00:00:10.950
 made the two people 

00:00:07.080 --> 00:00:14.340
 definitely a little poor us 

00:00:10.950 --> 00:00:18.270
 family appointments wanted the ears 

00:00:14.340 --> 00:00:22.380
 I go away with your ride he just wanted 

00:00:18.270 --> 00:00:25.980
 that is, that forest as soon as we put it 

00:00:22.380 --> 00:00:31.080
 ignorance we put ignorance ends 

00:00:25.980 --> 00:00:34.520
 selecao is agile and badly and is not 

00:00:31.080 --> 00:00:38.219
 a party is one that two people 

00:00:34.520 --> 00:00:40.500
 obviously needing calories at 

00:00:38.219 --> 00:00:43.469
 8 pm 

00:00:40.500 --> 00:00:46.530
 they wanted to eat their kebabs 

00:00:43.469 --> 00:00:49.430
 they wanted to eat the kebabs but there is 

00:00:46.530 --> 00:00:51.840
 an important end was for the marshal 

00:00:49.430 --> 00:00:54.059
 I say that I do your own 

00:00:51.840 --> 00:00:57.659
 reasoning I do not complain about this 

00:00:54.059 --> 00:01:01.010
 indeed, I am happy because I see them 

00:00:57.659 --> 00:01:03.359
 skill because when you're a flashlight 

00:01:01.010 --> 00:01:05.070
 he was looking for there and so this is the 

00:01:03.359 --> 00:01:06.479
 demonstration of the noa autonomies 

00:01:05.070 --> 00:01:08.880
 literary the marshal who gives 

00:01:06.479 --> 00:01:10.500
 to the other tickets and gives vanini is not 

00:01:08.880 --> 00:01:11.789
 clear but not macroeconomic 

00:01:10.500 --> 00:01:14.369
 we go absolute in the media ie 

00:01:11.789 --> 00:01:16.860
 certain capacity now there is a decline of 

00:01:14.369 --> 00:01:18.630
 important sugars in some way 

00:01:16.860 --> 00:01:21.690
 these two people will also have to 

00:01:18.630 --> 00:01:22.560
 fill it this thing, however, to those who are 

00:01:21.690 --> 00:01:25.500
 crisis succeeds 

00:01:22.560 --> 00:01:28.710
 I find the Marshall Agri Folk 

00:01:25.500 --> 00:01:31.020
 end in your opinion I'm sick I fear about 

00:01:28.710 --> 00:01:34.229
 others we are fine 

00:01:31.020 --> 00:01:36.210
 an equal amount together we have some 

00:01:34.229 --> 00:01:38.640
 pittella and the beautiful telecom machine 

00:01:36.210 --> 00:01:41.210
 setted in the morning asks why they are dumped 

00:01:38.640 --> 00:01:41.210
 with 2,000 laps 

00:01:41.420 --> 00:01:50.009
 as always we are a bit under version 

00:01:49.020 --> 00:01:52.619
 as employees but they had to 

00:01:50.009 --> 00:01:54.390
 intonation to give me the stations 

00:01:52.619 --> 00:01:56.700
 we have found the skill of the 

00:01:54.390 --> 00:01:58.560
 marshal who is not yeni I didn't mark 

00:01:56.700 --> 00:02:00.630
 so as not to lose face we will fill in 

00:01:58.560 --> 00:02:01.200
 somehow we will burst if this but 

00:02:00.630 --> 00:02:03.890
 live life 

00:02:01.200 --> 00:02:06.110
 the good ones work and yet so much 

00:02:03.890 --> 00:02:08.420
 I think I'm sick no alibi beautiful 

00:02:06.110 --> 00:02:11.410
 because we are good we come 

00:02:08.420 --> 00:02:11.410
 certainly a lot
