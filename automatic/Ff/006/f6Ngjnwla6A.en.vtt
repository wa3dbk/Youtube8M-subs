00:01:11.310 --> 00:01:13.520 
first of all I created 6 sprites left
sprite<00:01:11.760> which<00:01:12.240> is<00:01:12.510> the<00:01:12.659> character<00:01:13.110> without

00:01:18.440 --> 00:01:18.450 
without jetpack facing right and then I

00:01:18.450 --> 00:01:20.870 
without jetpack facing right and then I
has<00:01:18.540> a<00:01:18.570> jetpack<00:01:19.229> which<00:01:19.680> is<00:01:19.830> two<00:01:20.070> sprites<00:01:20.400> one

00:01:20.870 --> 00:01:20.880 
has a jetpack which is two sprites one

00:01:20.880 --> 00:01:23.420 
has a jetpack which is two sprites one
with<00:01:21.090> the<00:01:21.210> jetpack<00:01:21.830> when<00:01:22.830> he's<00:01:22.920> facing<00:01:23.220> left

00:01:23.420 --> 00:01:23.430

with the jetpack when he's facing left
with<00:01:23.580> the<00:01:23.670> jetpack<00:01:23.880> on<00:01:24.180> with<00:01:24.360> that<00:01:24.540> fire

00:01:24.920 --> 00:01:24.930 
with the jetpack on with that fire

00:01:24.930 --> 00:01:27.679 
with the jetpack on with that fire
coming<00:01:25.290> out<00:01:25.590> and<00:01:25.770> one<00:01:26.610> width<00:01:26.880> fire<00:01:27.150> coming<00:01:27.570> out

00:01:27.679 --> 00:01:27.689 
coming out and one width fire coming out

00:01:27.689 --> 00:01:30.560 
coming out and one width fire coming out
and<00:01:27.900> then<00:01:28.619> it's<00:01:29.009> him<00:01:29.700> facing<00:01:29.970> right<00:01:30.270> with<00:01:30.479> the

00:01:30.560 --> 00:01:30.570 
and then it's him facing right with the

00:01:30.570 --> 00:01:34.410 
and then it's him facing right with the
exact<00:01:30.780> same<00:01:30.960> thing<00:01:31.259> okay

00:01:34.410 --> 00:01:34.420 

00:01:34.420 --> 00:01:37.620 

and<00:01:34.930> then<00:01:35.080> I<00:01:35.170> made<00:01:35.350> a<00:01:35.380> jetpack<00:01:35.680> sprite<00:01:36.310> and<00:01:36.640> the

00:01:37.620 --> 00:01:37.630 
and then I made a jetpack sprite and the

00:01:37.630 --> 00:01:41.880 
and then I made a jetpack sprite and the
wall<00:01:39.120> now<00:01:40.120> for<00:01:40.330> the<00:01:40.390> objects<00:01:40.930> for<00:01:41.830> the

00:01:41.880 --> 00:01:41.890 
wall now for the objects for the

00:01:41.890 --> 00:01:44.730 
wall now for the objects for the
character<00:01:42.340> I<00:01:42.550> set<00:01:43.000> the<00:01:43.180> commands<00:01:43.690> as<00:01:43.810> treat<00:01:44.560> on

00:01:44.730 --> 00:01:44.740 
character I set the commands as treat on

00:01:44.740 --> 00:01:47.610 
character I set the commands as treat on
create<00:01:45.280> set<00:01:45.970> variable<00:01:46.570> and<00:01:46.900> you<00:01:47.290> can<00:01:47.410> call

00:01:47.610 --> 00:01:47.620 
create set variable and you can call

00:01:47.620 --> 00:01:49.710 
create set variable and you can call
whatever<00:01:47.770> variable<00:01:48.460> one<00:01:48.670> what<00:01:49.090> whatever<00:01:49.450> the

00:01:49.710 --> 00:01:49.720 
whatever variable one what whatever the

00:01:49.720 --> 00:01:52.560 
whatever variable one what whatever the
variable<00:01:50.080> name<00:01:50.920> you<00:01:51.160> want<00:01:51.340> to<00:01:51.400> give<00:01:51.490> it<00:01:51.790> but

00:01:52.560 --> 00:01:52.570 
variable name you want to give it but

00:01:52.570 --> 00:01:54.810 
variable name you want to give it but
this<00:01:52.900> will<00:01:53.110> basically<00:01:53.229> be<00:01:53.860> the<00:01:54.040> variable<00:01:54.460> to

00:01:54.810 --> 00:01:54.820 
this will basically be the variable to

00:01:54.820 --> 00:01:57.920 
this will basically be the variable to
let<00:01:55.000> you<00:01:55.150> on<00:01:55.510> fly<00:01:56.140> or<00:01:56.440> not<00:01:56.470> so<00:01:57.280> I<00:01:57.340> called<00:01:57.580> it<00:01:57.700> fly

00:01:57.920 --> 00:01:57.930 
let you on fly or not so I called it fly

00:01:57.930 --> 00:02:02.340 
let you on fly or not so I called it fly
which<00:01:58.930> is<00:01:58.960> very<00:01:59.320> simple<00:02:00.210> and<00:02:01.210> then<00:02:01.420> on<00:02:01.630> step<00:02:02.020> if

00:02:02.340 --> 00:02:02.350 
which is very simple and then on step if

00:02:02.350 --> 00:02:06.120 
which is very simple and then on step if

0.5 okay the rest of it is all of my
platformer<00:02:20.739> tutorials<00:02:21.459> so<00:02:21.610> go<00:02:21.730> watch<00:02:21.940> that

00:02:22.170 --> 00:02:22.180 
platformer tutorials so go watch that

00:02:22.180 --> 00:02:23.460 
platformer tutorials so go watch that
I'm<00:02:22.390> not<00:02:22.510> going<00:02:22.690> to<00:02:22.750> go<00:02:22.840> into<00:02:23.050> detail<00:02:23.440> about

that and what I'm going to go into
detail<00:02:26.350> about<00:02:26.380> is<00:02:26.890> the<00:02:27.220> jumping<00:02:27.989> now<00:02:28.989> when<00:02:29.470> it

00:02:29.580 --> 00:02:29.590 
detail about is the jumping now when it

00:02:29.590 --> 00:02:31.290 
detail about is the jumping now when it
can't<00:02:29.830> when<00:02:30.130> the<00:02:30.489> character<00:02:30.880> collides<00:02:31.180> with

can't when the character collides with

00:02:31.300 --> 00:02:32.130 
can't when the character collides with
the<00:02:31.390> jetpacks

00:02:32.130 --> 00:02:32.140 
the jetpacks

00:02:32.140 --> 00:02:35.790 
the jetpacks
set<00:02:32.950> the<00:02:33.100> variable<00:02:33.220> fly<00:02:33.760> to<00:02:33.820> one<00:02:34.739> when<00:02:35.739> a

00:02:35.790 --> 00:02:35.800 
set the variable fly to one when a

00:02:35.800 --> 00:02:37.110 
set the variable fly to one when a

that's<00:02:37.270> due<00:02:37.480> to<00:02:37.540> my<00:02:37.660> platformer<00:02:38.230> video<00:02:39.390> okay

00:02:40.380 --> 00:02:40.390 
that's due to my platformer video okay

00:02:40.390 --> 00:02:43.440 
that's due to my platformer video okay
now<00:02:40.540> here's<00:02:40.810> a<00:02:40.900> tricky<00:02:41.200> bit<00:02:41.970> when<00:02:42.970> you<00:02:43.180> click

00:02:43.440 --> 00:02:43.450 
now here's a tricky bit when you click

00:02:43.450 --> 00:02:47.280 
now here's a tricky bit when you click
the<00:02:43.690> left<00:02:43.930> on<00:02:44.410> the<00:02:45.330> keyboard<00:02:46.330> which<00:02:46.959> will<00:02:46.989> make

00:02:47.280 --> 00:02:47.290 
the left on the keyboard which will make

00:02:47.290 --> 00:02:51.509 
the left on the keyboard which will make
it<00:02:47.320> character<00:02:47.709> go<00:02:47.830> left<00:02:49.200> jump<00:02:50.200> to<00:02:50.380> position<00:02:50.860> -

00:02:51.509 --> 00:02:51.519 
it character go left jump to position -

00:02:51.519 --> 00:02:56.090 
it character go left jump to position -

00:02:56.090 --> 00:02:56.100 
for relatives if fly is equal to 0

00:02:56.100 --> 00:02:59.820 
for relatives if fly is equal to 0
change<00:02:57.100> sprite<00:02:57.790> into<00:02:58.360> left<00:02:58.930> which<00:02:59.290> is<00:02:59.470> the<00:02:59.680> one

00:02:59.820 --> 00:02:59.830 
change sprite into left which is the one

00:02:59.830 --> 00:03:03.380 
change sprite into left which is the one

it<00:03:04.390> fly<00:03:05.380> is<00:03:05.440> equal<00:03:06.070> to<00:03:06.190> 1<00:03:06.780> make<00:03:07.780> sure<00:03:07.959> you

00:03:08.070 --> 00:03:08.080 
it fly is equal to 1 make sure you

00:03:08.080 --> 00:03:13.350 
it fly is equal to 1 make sure you
create<00:03:08.790> an<00:03:09.790> enclosed<00:03:10.720> area<00:03:11.170> here<00:03:11.470> if<00:03:12.160> and<00:03:13.150> then

00:03:13.350 --> 00:03:13.360 
create an enclosed area here if and then

00:03:13.360 --> 00:03:16.020 
create an enclosed area here if and then
create<00:03:13.660> another<00:03:13.780> check<00:03:14.110> variable<00:03:14.590> if<00:03:14.769> V<00:03:15.730> speed

00:03:16.020 --> 00:03:16.030 
create another check variable if V speed

00:03:16.030 --> 00:03:19.140 
create another check variable if V speed
is<00:03:16.269> larger<00:03:16.810> than<00:03:16.959> 0<00:03:17.310> and<00:03:18.310> create<00:03:18.730> a<00:03:18.790> separate

00:03:19.140 --> 00:03:19.150 
is larger than 0 and create a separate

00:03:19.150 --> 00:03:22.770 
is larger than 0 and create a separate
enclosure<00:03:20.140> here<00:03:20.799> then<00:03:21.700> change<00:03:22.090> sprite<00:03:22.450> into

00:03:22.770 --> 00:03:22.780 
enclosure here then change sprite into

00:03:22.780 --> 00:03:27.120 
enclosure here then change sprite into
left<00:03:23.049> jetpack<00:03:23.680> sub<00:03:24.190> image<00:03:24.549> 0<00:03:25.180> speed<00:03:25.780> 0<00:03:26.200> so<00:03:27.010> what

00:03:27.120 --> 00:03:27.130 
left jetpack sub image 0 speed 0 so what

00:03:27.130 --> 00:03:30.630 
left jetpack sub image 0 speed 0 so what
this<00:03:27.250> will<00:03:27.459> do<00:03:27.610> is<00:03:27.910> if<00:03:28.440> he's<00:03:29.440> going<00:03:29.680> down<00:03:30.130> like

00:03:30.630 --> 00:03:30.640 
this will do is if he's going down like

00:03:30.640 --> 00:03:33.180 
this will do is if he's going down like
if<00:03:30.790> he's<00:03:30.910> falling<00:03:31.269> down<00:03:31.450> and<00:03:32.170> then<00:03:32.470> no<00:03:32.799> flames

00:03:33.180 --> 00:03:33.190 
if he's falling down and then no flames

00:03:33.190 --> 00:03:35.100 
if he's falling down and then no flames
will<00:03:33.430> come<00:03:33.610> out<00:03:33.760> of<00:03:33.910> the<00:03:33.970> jetpack<00:03:34.239> basically

00:03:35.100 --> 00:03:35.110 
will come out of the jetpack basically

00:03:35.110 --> 00:03:37.949 
will come out of the jetpack basically
and<00:03:35.350> what<00:03:36.250> this<00:03:36.459> will<00:03:36.610> do<00:03:36.760> here<00:03:37.000> if<00:03:37.239> V<00:03:37.510> speed<00:03:37.780> is

00:03:37.949 --> 00:03:37.959 
and what this will do here if V speed is

00:03:37.959 --> 00:03:41.370 
and what this will do here if V speed is
equal<00:03:38.440> to<00:03:38.590> 0<00:03:39.329> change<00:03:40.329> it<00:03:40.570> back<00:03:40.780> to<00:03:40.840> the<00:03:41.019> left

00:03:41.370 --> 00:03:41.380 
equal to 0 change it back to the left

00:03:41.380 --> 00:03:44.699 
equal to 0 change it back to the left
jetpack<00:03:42.100> sub<00:03:42.670> n<00:03:42.970> 0<00:03:43.209> speed<00:03:43.450> 0<00:03:43.720> that<00:03:44.290> means<00:03:44.319> if

00:03:44.699 --> 00:03:44.709 
jetpack sub n 0 speed 0 that means if

00:03:44.709 --> 00:03:46.589 
jetpack sub n 0 speed 0 that means if
he's<00:03:44.980> not<00:03:45.160> going<00:03:45.400> up<00:03:45.640> or<00:03:45.819> down<00:03:45.849> so<00:03:46.060> when<00:03:46.450> he's

00:03:46.589 --> 00:03:46.599 
he's not going up or down so when he's

00:03:46.599 --> 00:03:47.309 
he's not going up or down so when he's
on<00:03:46.720> the<00:03:46.750> ground

00:03:47.309 --> 00:03:47.319 
on the ground

00:03:47.319 --> 00:03:49.679 
on the ground
then<00:03:47.980> there<00:03:48.519> won't<00:03:48.609> be<00:03:48.700> any<00:03:48.760> flame<00:03:49.269> coming<00:03:49.569> out

00:03:49.679 --> 00:03:49.689 
then there won't be any flame coming out

00:03:49.689 --> 00:03:52.140 
then there won't be any flame coming out
of<00:03:49.810> a<00:03:49.870> jet<00:03:50.049> pack<00:03:50.200> either<00:03:50.439> okay<00:03:51.069> and<00:03:51.879> then<00:03:51.999> the

00:03:52.140 --> 00:03:52.150 
of a jet pack either okay and then the

00:03:52.150 --> 00:03:54.449 
of a jet pack either okay and then the
last<00:03:52.420> bit<00:03:52.719> which<00:03:53.049> is<00:03:53.079> if<00:03:53.409> V<00:03:53.590> speed<00:03:53.859> is<00:03:53.980> smaller

00:03:54.449 --> 00:03:54.459 
last bit which is if V speed is smaller

00:03:54.459 --> 00:03:57.780 
last bit which is if V speed is smaller
than<00:03:54.819> zero<00:03:55.439> said<00:03:56.439> change<00:03:57.069> the<00:03:57.219> trying<00:03:57.430> to<00:03:57.579> left

00:03:57.780 --> 00:03:57.790 
than zero said change the trying to left

00:03:57.790 --> 00:04:00.030 
than zero said change the trying to left
jet<00:03:57.999> pack<00:03:58.209> sub<00:03:58.659> image<00:03:58.930> one<00:03:59.260> which<00:03:59.650> means<00:03:59.829> if

00:04:00.030 --> 00:04:00.040 
jet pack sub image one which means if

00:04:00.040 --> 00:04:02.039 
jet pack sub image one which means if
he's<00:04:00.189> going<00:04:00.400> upwards<00:04:00.969> he's<00:04:01.719> gonna<00:04:01.840> have

00:04:02.039 --> 00:04:02.049 
he's going upwards he's gonna have

00:04:02.049 --> 00:04:05.729 
he's going upwards he's gonna have
flames<00:04:02.349> on<00:04:02.799> his<00:04:02.849> jet<00:04:03.849> pack<00:04:04.170> now<00:04:05.170> right<00:04:05.500> it's

00:04:05.729 --> 00:04:05.739 
flames on his jet pack now right it's

00:04:05.739 --> 00:04:08.069 
flames on his jet pack now right it's
exactly<00:04:06.159> the<00:04:06.310> same<00:04:06.489> things<00:04:06.810> except<00:04:07.810> we<00:04:07.900> just

00:04:08.069 --> 00:04:08.079 
exactly the same things except we just

00:04:08.079 --> 00:04:10.140 
exactly the same things except we just
replaced<00:04:08.439> left<00:04:08.799> with<00:04:09.069> right<00:04:09.310> that's<00:04:09.909> all<00:04:10.060> you

00:04:10.140 --> 00:04:10.150 
replaced left with right that's all you

00:04:10.150 --> 00:04:14.849 
replaced left with right that's all you
have<00:04:10.269> to<00:04:10.420> do<00:04:11.280> with<00:04:12.280> up<00:04:12.519> if<00:04:13.299> fly<00:04:14.109> is<00:04:14.169> equal<00:04:14.680> to

have to do with up if fly is equal to
one
