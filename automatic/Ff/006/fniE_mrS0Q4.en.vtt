00:03:50.970 --> 00:03:50.980 
and then this is how I did our seat work

00:03:50.980 --> 00:03:55.979 
and then this is how I did our seat work
I<00:03:51.780> just<00:03:52.780> typed<00:03:53.019> this<00:03:53.230> up<00:03:53.410> on<00:03:53.790> a<00:03:54.790> page<00:03:55.570> and<00:03:55.900> then

00:03:55.979 --> 00:03:55.989 
I just typed this up on a page and then

00:03:55.989 --> 00:03:58.290 
I just typed this up on a page and then
I<00:03:56.080> laminated<00:03:56.620> it<00:03:56.739> so<00:03:56.890> I<00:03:56.920> can<00:03:57.190> dry<00:03:57.340> erase<00:03:57.640> I<00:03:58.000> just

00:03:58.290 --> 00:03:58.300 
I laminated it so I can dry erase I just

00:03:58.300 --> 00:04:00.540 
I laminated it so I can dry erase I just
keep<00:03:58.570> using<00:03:58.720> it<00:03:58.900> over<00:03:59.050> and<00:03:59.140> over<00:03:59.290> again<00:03:59.440> and<00:03:59.830> so

00:04:00.540 --> 00:04:00.550 
keep using it over and over again and so

00:04:00.550 --> 00:04:02.340 
keep using it over and over again and so
this<00:04:00.700> is<00:04:00.820> right<00:04:00.940> in<00:04:01.120> there<00:04:01.330> and<00:04:01.660> it<00:04:01.870> just<00:04:02.170> does

00:04:02.340 --> 00:04:02.350
