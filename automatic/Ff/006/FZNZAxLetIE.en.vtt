00:00:27.029 --> 00:00:32.750
 there in sight 

00:00:27.960 --> 00:00:32.750

00:00:39.210 --> 00:00:43.410
 practically have the federal republic 

00:00:40.829 --> 00:00:45.770
 germany i stress federal republic 

00:00:43.410 --> 00:00:47.730

00:00:45.770 --> 00:00:49.739
 Federal Republic no I say Germany 

00:00:47.730 --> 00:00:51.960

00:00:49.739 --> 00:00:53.789
 Germany that is good that the 

00:00:51.960 --> 00:00:55.079
 Chancellor says yes only Federal Republic 

00:00:53.789 --> 00:00:56.730
 Germany no longer has anything to do with it 

00:00:55.079 --> 00:00:57.870
 but the other thing is me now again 

00:00:56.730 --> 00:01:00.120
 against the merkel 

00:00:57.870 --> 00:01:01.890
 normally one would have to be there in the Bundestag 

00:01:00.120 --> 00:01:10.830
 you would have the flogging a flatter 

00:01:01.890 --> 00:01:14.280
 So klaus and I would stand there in front 

00:01:10.830 --> 00:01:18.360
 bludgeon go in to the Chamber 

00:01:14.280 --> 00:01:20.220

00:01:22.439 --> 00:01:28.890

00:01:25.500 --> 00:01:30.750
 what you say to them what these green 

00:01:28.890 --> 00:01:33.210
 I'm not interested in medicine 

00:01:30.750 --> 00:01:33.869
 interesting as we do not like each other 

00:01:33.210 --> 00:01:37.049
 choose 

00:01:33.869 --> 00:01:41.579
 no, with their views, that's it 

00:01:37.049 --> 00:01:44.759
 Rags are really the rags look 

00:01:41.579 --> 00:01:47.210
 you look at it all are rags that 

00:01:44.759 --> 00:01:51.049
 in my opinion I am there the 

00:01:47.210 --> 00:01:57.290
 red that's a short middle is that 

00:01:51.049 --> 00:01:57.290

00:02:01.340 --> 00:02:06.490
 underage gets involved now 

00:02:03.520 --> 00:02:14.210
 so concentrate with his 18-year-old 

00:02:06.490 --> 00:02:17.440
 Behavior 2020 40 years younger is not 

00:02:14.210 --> 00:02:20.120
 normal as an old guy he still has 

00:02:17.440 --> 00:02:23.390
 for it had mourned for his wife 

00:02:20.120 --> 00:02:24.140
 there were the talking and so on 

00:02:23.390 --> 00:02:26.240
 The life 

00:02:24.140 --> 00:02:28.840
 If he had taken the claudia red there 

00:02:26.240 --> 00:02:28.840
 will only agree 

00:02:39.460 --> 00:02:43.250
 next topic will be daniel schuhmacher 

00:02:42.380 --> 00:02:45.470

00:02:43.250 --> 00:02:47.060
 what do you say that's all 

00:02:45.470 --> 00:02:48.860
 manipulated if you take that now 

00:02:47.060 --> 00:02:50.360

00:02:48.860 --> 00:02:51.890

00:02:50.360 --> 00:02:53.720
 now that should lie now that is 

00:02:51.890 --> 00:02:54.980
 but already everything was pre-programmed that was 

00:02:53.720 --> 00:02:56.690
 but already preprogrammed that the 

00:02:54.980 --> 00:02:58.820
 practically one and two and so on 

00:02:56.690 --> 00:03:00.560
 this is all a planned but lug and 

00:02:58.820 --> 00:03:02.870
 wore that is all I mean it is 

00:03:00.560 --> 00:03:04.970
 yes youth actually it should be synonymous 

00:03:02.870 --> 00:03:07.489
 constructive and and model for the 

00:03:04.970 --> 00:03:09.260
 young and this whole team sitting there 

00:03:07.489 --> 00:03:11.239

00:03:09.260 --> 00:03:15.050
 express there and then there comes one 

00:03:11.239 --> 00:03:16.519
 Sex or something you have to too 

00:03:15.050 --> 00:03:18.470
 Justify it because sometimes I have one 

00:03:16.519 --> 00:03:20.450
 embarrassing affair mario ried has 

00:03:18.470 --> 00:03:21.530
 but only six left in us 

00:03:20.450 --> 00:03:23.750
 our society 

00:03:21.530 --> 00:03:25.519
 There are so many nice things other than when 

00:03:23.750 --> 00:03:28.550
 she loves with our beautiful earth 

00:03:25.519 --> 00:03:30.260
 deal and explore nature and 

00:03:28.550 --> 00:03:36.530
 and as such 

00:03:30.260 --> 00:03:37.640
 and not only that I other generation 

00:03:36.530 --> 00:03:39.250
 Do not want everything now 

00:03:37.640 --> 00:03:41.959
 pay back then we look 

00:03:39.250 --> 00:03:45.440

00:03:41.959 --> 00:03:47.510
 such things as those of which one 

00:03:45.440 --> 00:03:49.100
 Benefits earlier are still nice with 

00:03:47.510 --> 00:03:51.380
 That's what I do today 

00:03:49.100 --> 00:03:52.760
 not all the animals are so good and he 

00:03:51.380 --> 00:03:54.830
 each does as much as six 

00:03:52.760 --> 00:03:57.100
 to make people do it right once 

00:03:54.830 --> 00:03:59.690
 year that is only the male make 

00:03:57.100 --> 00:04:01.880
 in bulk, how should the 

00:03:59.690 --> 00:04:03.590

00:04:01.880 --> 00:04:04.660

00:04:04.660 --> 00:04:08.290
 in bh I mean so much they relish 

00:04:06.970 --> 00:04:09.580
 But they should do it all 

00:04:08.290 --> 00:04:12.390
 I can not stay under control 

00:04:09.580 --> 00:04:12.390
