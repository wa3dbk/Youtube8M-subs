00:00:00.079 --> 00:00:04.770
 Normally you would use a Ford C-max 

00:00:02.610 --> 00:00:06.330
 not so quickly compare with one 

00:00:04.770 --> 00:00:08.519
 Volkswagen Golf 

00:00:06.330 --> 00:00:12.740
 but thanks to new important ones 

00:00:08.519 --> 00:00:12.740
 agreement is everything else 

00:00:16.500 --> 00:00:20.699
 the volkswagen golf is always one 

00:00:18.420 --> 00:00:23.130
 audience favorite ever since is short 

00:00:20.699 --> 00:00:24.420
 the hatchback has become even more popular 

00:00:23.130 --> 00:00:26.789
 the Germans have provided a fact 

00:00:24.420 --> 00:00:28.859
 of a hybrid powertrain 

00:00:26.789 --> 00:00:31.279
 making him eligible for 7% 

00:00:28.859 --> 00:00:31.279
 addition 

00:00:32.969 --> 00:00:36.300
 for a moment it seemed that the wave was the 

00:00:34.770 --> 00:00:38.010
 cheapest plug hybrid van 

00:00:36.300 --> 00:00:39.510
 would become the Netherlands 

00:00:38.010 --> 00:00:43.379
 but there is a stop to that 

00:00:39.510 --> 00:00:45.120
 with this c-max plug-in hybrid 

00:00:43.379 --> 00:00:47.219
 that the c-max is now also available with a 

00:00:45.120 --> 00:00:49.530
 At first glance, the sticker appears to be none 

00:00:47.219 --> 00:00:51.300
 news and existing debt more 

00:00:49.530 --> 00:00:53.160
 plug-in hybrids 

00:00:51.300 --> 00:00:55.440
 the c-max is also a completely different one 

00:00:53.160 --> 00:00:58.800
 car to start it is no right back 

00:00:55.440 --> 00:01:01.590
 the two of a space bear nevertheless stand 

00:00:58.800 --> 00:01:03.390
 directly opposite each other because of them 

00:01:01.590 --> 00:01:06.570
 price 

00:01:03.390 --> 00:01:10.530
 the volkswagen costs 38 wheel the ford 

00:01:06.570 --> 00:01:11.520
 margot for 35,000 euros townhouse 

00:01:10.530 --> 00:01:13.470
 we are talking about the different things like this 

00:01:11.520 --> 00:01:15.509
 immediately let's have a look first 

00:01:13.470 --> 00:01:17.650
 what the similarities are between the two 

00:01:15.509 --> 00:01:19.750
 cars 

00:01:17.650 --> 00:01:21.160
 The most important agreement is one 

00:01:19.750 --> 00:01:22.540
 powertrain 

00:01:21.160 --> 00:01:24.940
 both the volkswagen and the ford 

00:01:22.540 --> 00:01:26.740
 combine a strong gasoline engine with 

00:01:24.940 --> 00:01:28.690
 an electric motor 

00:01:26.740 --> 00:01:30.910
 both cars can be fully electric 

00:01:28.690 --> 00:01:33.610
 they have a range in between 

00:01:30.910 --> 00:01:35.560
 the 30 and the 50 km 

00:01:33.610 --> 00:01:37.000
 do you charge at a charging station or 

00:01:35.560 --> 00:01:38.860
 just at home 

00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:41.650
 within three hours the battery is at all 

00:01:38.860 --> 00:01:44.380
 two takes full again at the outlet 

00:01:41.650 --> 00:01:44.950
 it all a little longer the volkswagen and 

00:01:44.380 --> 00:01:47.170
 the ford 

00:01:44.950 --> 00:01:48.520
 are good in their standard gear 

00:01:47.170 --> 00:01:51.280
 they both have 

00:01:48.520 --> 00:01:53.440
 luxury seats about the navigation system 

00:01:51.280 --> 00:01:55.420
 parking sensors 

00:01:53.440 --> 00:01:56.560
 air conditioning an automatic 

00:01:55.420 --> 00:01:58.720
 gear box 

00:01:56.560 --> 00:02:01.380
 cruise control and the required 

00:01:58.720 --> 00:02:01.380
 charging cables 

00:02:01.600 --> 00:02:05.320
 You saw the following agreement 

00:02:03.310 --> 00:02:08.350
 don't arrive because they are both 

00:02:05.320 --> 00:02:09.790
 equally spacious the battery pack is both 

00:02:08.350 --> 00:02:11.590
 at the ford and the volkswagen 

00:02:09.790 --> 00:02:13.810
 in the trunk do not escape each other 

00:02:11.590 --> 00:02:15.700
 therefore not so much 

00:02:13.810 --> 00:02:18.280
 a sensitive point you for the ford that there 

00:02:15.700 --> 00:02:20.790
 bigger than it actually looks 

00:02:18.280 --> 00:02:20.790
 is 

00:02:22.980 --> 00:02:26.879
 Volkswagen benefits the GTV as one 

00:02:25.379 --> 00:02:30.209
 electric gt 

00:02:26.879 --> 00:02:33.950
 and sporty car so so looks again 

00:02:30.209 --> 00:02:33.950
 anyway how he actually 

00:02:43.480 --> 00:02:48.770
 The GT-1 makes its appearance when it is 

00:02:46.970 --> 00:02:50.120
 indeed a sporty car to take with you 

00:02:48.770 --> 00:02:52.460
 to drive 

00:02:50.120 --> 00:02:56.090
 it is also the fastest of the two he 

00:02:52.460 --> 00:02:58.970
 has 20hp more on board with the GTE 

00:02:56.090 --> 00:03:00.920
 button lets you release the beast in him 

00:02:58.970 --> 00:03:02.180
 both engines then join forces 

00:03:00.920 --> 00:03:03.590
 and the passengers 

00:03:02.180 --> 00:03:06.040
 get a matching sound check 

00:03:03.590 --> 00:03:06.040
 served 

00:03:08.720 --> 00:03:14.060
 of which on the outside of the car 

00:03:11.030 --> 00:03:15.650
 nothing wrong to hear 

00:03:14.060 --> 00:03:17.570
 you can use the gasoline engine of the volkswagen 

00:03:15.650 --> 00:03:19.760
 also use as a kind of aggregate 

00:03:17.570 --> 00:03:21.920
 allowing you to create power while 

00:03:19.760 --> 00:03:23.300
 and you can still use that power 

00:03:21.920 --> 00:03:25.430
 save once 

00:03:23.300 --> 00:03:27.110
 that has a reason you come to germany 

00:03:25.430 --> 00:03:29.780
 most inner cities no longer 

00:03:27.110 --> 00:03:33.470
 with a dirty car but with this wave 

00:03:29.780 --> 00:03:35.000
 you can go wherever you want 

00:03:33.470 --> 00:03:36.980
 not that he is the c-max of himself 

00:03:35.000 --> 00:03:37.880
 shake off because also the ford saved 

00:03:36.980 --> 00:03:40.220
 if desired 

00:03:37.880 --> 00:03:42.080
 your power for the city you can use 

00:03:40.220 --> 00:03:44.090
 Do not use gasoline engine to 

00:03:42.080 --> 00:03:45.830
 make steam on the way 

00:03:44.090 --> 00:03:47.660
 power has to come out of the wall at the ford 

00:03:45.830 --> 00:03:49.220
 come 

00:03:47.660 --> 00:03:51.770
 god has a name to uphold 

00:03:49.220 --> 00:03:53.209
 when it comes to driving dynamics 

00:03:51.770 --> 00:03:54.920
 the handsome heads there alone have 

00:03:53.209 --> 00:03:57.650
 can't come or learn this 

00:03:54.920 --> 00:04:00.560
 plugin hybrid weighs more than 400 kilos more 

00:03:57.650 --> 00:04:05.240
 then a standard c-max and you can feel it 

00:04:00.560 --> 00:04:06.770
 well in the turns for the volkswagen 

00:04:05.240 --> 00:04:09.830
 both have an existing model 

00:04:06.770 --> 00:04:14.709
 converted to the plug hybrid and as 

00:04:09.830 --> 00:04:14.709
 we succeeded one better than the other 

00:04:17.750 --> 00:04:21.650
 the c-max plug-in hybrid creates 

00:04:19.880 --> 00:04:22.700
 expectations that the car actually does not 

00:04:21.650 --> 00:04:24.470
 wake up 

00:04:22.700 --> 00:04:26.060
 he looks taller than he is and he reaches out 

00:04:24.470 --> 00:04:27.200
 not like a real ford 

00:04:26.060 --> 00:04:31.130
 that he is so much heavier than one 

00:04:27.200 --> 00:04:32.930
 normal c-max but then the wave gte 

00:04:31.130 --> 00:04:34.580
 although it costs a little more money 

00:04:32.930 --> 00:04:37.490
 you get more for that extra money 

00:04:34.580 --> 00:04:39.320
 sportiness and more ease of use and 

00:04:37.490 --> 00:04:41.270
 then there is the wave 

00:04:39.320 --> 00:04:44.270
 height and tensile weight 

00:04:41.270 --> 00:04:46.490
 of fifteen hundred kilograms thereafter 

00:04:44.270 --> 00:04:48.550
 He won twice over this 

00:04:46.490 --> 00:04:48.550
 duel
