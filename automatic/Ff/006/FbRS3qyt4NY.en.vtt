just see two people in the story that
surrounds<00:00:49.800> them<00:00:50.329> so<00:00:51.329> there<00:00:51.480> are<00:00:51.539> a<00:00:51.600> lot<00:00:51.719> of

00:00:51.740 --> 00:00:51.750 
surrounds them so there are a lot of

00:00:51.750 --> 00:00:53.360 
surrounds them so there are a lot of
choices<00:00:51.989> we<00:00:52.260> can<00:00:52.289> make<00:00:52.530> as<00:00:52.649> photographers<00:00:53.160> to

00:00:53.360 --> 00:00:53.370 
choices we can make as photographers to

00:00:53.370 --> 00:00:54.950 
choices we can make as photographers to
achieve<00:00:53.670> that<00:00:53.820> one<00:00:54.239> of<00:00:54.329> the<00:00:54.420> things<00:00:54.629> we<00:00:54.809> love

00:00:54.950 --> 00:00:54.960 
achieve that one of the things we love

00:00:54.960 --> 00:00:56.389 
achieve that one of the things we love
about<00:00:55.020> the<00:00:55.350> way<00:00:55.500> that<00:00:55.620> we're<00:00:55.770> lighting<00:00:56.129> these

00:00:56.389 --> 00:00:56.399 
about the way that we're lighting these

00:00:56.399 --> 00:00:58.250 
about the way that we're lighting these
receptions<00:00:56.940> the<00:00:57.210> first<00:00:57.449> fans<00:00:57.629> in<00:00:57.780> particular

00:00:58.250 --> 00:00:58.260 
receptions the first fans in particular

00:00:58.260 --> 00:00:59.990 
receptions the first fans in particular
is<00:00:58.739> that<00:00:58.980> because<00:00:59.250> we<00:00:59.399> have<00:00:59.430> a<00:00:59.579> light<00:00:59.789> source

00:00:59.990 --> 00:01:00.000 
is that because we have a light source

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:01.970 
is that because we have a light source
off<00:01:00.180> to<00:01:00.329> the<00:01:00.420> side<00:01:00.629> but<00:01:01.289> it's<00:01:01.469> also<00:01:01.680> going

00:01:01.970 --> 00:01:01.980 
off to the side but it's also going

00:01:01.980 --> 00:01:03.950 
off to the side but it's also going
through<00:01:02.190> a<00:01:02.280> very<00:01:02.460> large<00:01:02.640> reflector<00:01:03.000> it's<00:01:03.750> very

00:01:03.950 --> 00:01:03.960 
through a very large reflector it's very

00:01:03.960 --> 00:01:05.660 
through a very large reflector it's very
hard<00:01:04.260> to<00:01:04.350> look<00:01:04.470> at<00:01:04.559> those<00:01:04.710> images<00:01:04.890> and<00:01:05.309> say<00:01:05.460> oh

00:01:05.660 --> 00:01:05.670 
hard to look at those images and say oh

00:01:05.670 --> 00:01:07.700 
hard to look at those images and say oh
that<00:01:05.970> was<00:01:06.360> definitely<00:01:06.750> flash<00:01:07.020> or<00:01:07.439> that<00:01:07.560> was

00:01:07.700 --> 00:01:07.710 
that was definitely flash or that was

00:01:07.710 --> 00:01:09.620 
that was definitely flash or that was
that<00:01:07.830> really<00:01:07.860> natural<00:01:08.400> light<00:01:08.549> and<00:01:08.909> because<00:01:09.479> we

00:01:09.620 --> 00:01:09.630 
that really natural light and because we

00:01:09.630 --> 00:01:11.480 
that really natural light and because we
have<00:01:09.840> that<00:01:09.869> question<00:01:10.260> you<00:01:10.950> could<00:01:11.130> always<00:01:11.280> make

00:01:11.480 --> 00:01:11.490 
have that question you could always make

00:01:11.490 --> 00:01:12.890 
have that question you could always make
the<00:01:11.610> argument<00:01:11.640> that<00:01:12.090> the<00:01:12.270> light<00:01:12.479> was<00:01:12.659> Pam

00:01:12.890 --> 00:01:12.900 
the argument that the light was Pam

00:01:12.900 --> 00:01:15.140 
the argument that the light was Pam
didn't<00:01:13.229> but<00:01:13.470> it<00:01:13.560> was<00:01:13.650> found<00:01:13.890> in<00:01:14.040> the<00:01:14.070> rain<00:01:14.310> that

00:01:15.140 --> 00:01:15.150 
didn't but it was found in the rain that

00:01:15.150 --> 00:01:16.730 
didn't but it was found in the rain that
is<00:01:15.210> always<00:01:15.630> a<00:01:15.659> sign<00:01:15.990> that<00:01:16.020> we<00:01:16.229> have<00:01:16.259> succeeded

00:01:16.730 --> 00:01:16.740 
is always a sign that we have succeeded

00:01:16.740 --> 00:01:18.410 
is always a sign that we have succeeded
if<00:01:17.220> somebody<00:01:17.490> looks<00:01:17.670> at<00:01:17.820> one<00:01:17.909> of<00:01:18.000> our<00:01:18.060> pictures

00:01:18.410 --> 00:01:18.420 
if somebody looks at one of our pictures

00:01:18.420 --> 00:01:20.270 
if somebody looks at one of our pictures
and<00:01:18.689> they<00:01:18.780> see<00:01:18.930> that<00:01:19.110> couple<00:01:19.320> they<00:01:19.950> see<00:01:20.009> that

00:01:20.270 --> 00:01:20.280 
and they see that couple they see that

00:01:20.280 --> 00:01:21.830 
and they see that couple they see that
moment<00:01:20.670> they<00:01:20.880> see<00:01:20.939> the<00:01:21.150> love<00:01:21.299> between<00:01:21.600> them

00:01:21.830 --> 00:01:21.840 
moment they see the love between them

00:01:21.840 --> 00:01:23.480 
moment they see the love between them
and<00:01:22.020> they<00:01:22.200> don't<00:01:22.320> see<00:01:22.590> what<00:01:22.770> photographer<00:01:23.280> did

00:01:23.480 --> 00:01:23.490 
and they don't see what photographer did

00:01:23.490 --> 00:01:24.170 
and they don't see what photographer did
at<00:01:23.700> all

00:01:24.170 --> 00:01:24.180 
at all

00:01:24.180 --> 00:01:26.030 
at all
I<00:01:24.210> also<00:01:25.020> think<00:01:25.230> it's<00:01:25.320> really<00:01:25.380> important<00:01:25.830> you

00:01:26.030 --> 00:01:26.040 
I also think it's really important you

00:01:26.040 --> 00:01:26.960 
I also think it's really important you
know<00:01:26.130> if<00:01:26.250> you're<00:01:26.370> if<00:01:26.550> you're<00:01:26.580> gonna<00:01:26.730> be<00:01:26.880> using

00:01:26.960 --> 00:01:26.970 
know if you're if you're gonna be using

00:01:26.970 --> 00:01:28.970 
know if you're if you're gonna be using
off-camera<00:01:27.450> lighting<00:01:27.840> to<00:01:28.050> to<00:01:28.590> think<00:01:28.800> about

00:01:28.970 --> 00:01:28.980 
off-camera lighting to to think about

00:01:28.980 --> 00:01:30.320 
off-camera lighting to to think about
where<00:01:29.160> you're<00:01:29.310> actually<00:01:29.460> placing<00:01:29.970> the<00:01:30.060> stands

00:01:30.320 --> 00:01:30.330 
where you're actually placing the stands

00:01:30.330 --> 00:01:32.030 
where you're actually placing the stands
and<00:01:30.540> the<00:01:30.600> lights<00:01:30.840> make<00:01:31.440> sure<00:01:31.590> it<00:01:31.680> fits<00:01:31.890> with

00:01:32.030 --> 00:01:32.040 
and the lights make sure it fits with

00:01:32.040 --> 00:01:33.980 
and the lights make sure it fits with
the<00:01:32.070> aesthetic<00:01:32.460> of<00:01:32.550> the<00:01:32.670> wedding<00:01:32.940> they've<00:01:33.840> put

00:01:33.980 --> 00:01:33.990 
the aesthetic of the wedding they've put

especially the best couples they're

00:01:39.750 --> 00:01:41.120 
especially the best couples they're
really<00:01:39.960> thinking<00:01:40.080> about<00:01:40.440> what's<00:01:41.070> the

00:01:41.120 --> 00:01:41.130 
really thinking about what's the

00:01:41.130 --> 00:01:42.590 
really thinking about what's the
negative<00:01:41.460> feeling<00:01:41.640> for<00:01:41.790> my<00:01:41.880> guests<00:01:42.090> and

negative feeling for my guests and
that's<00:01:43.110> like<00:01:43.260> our<00:01:43.410> favorite<00:01:43.440> can<00:01:43.830> a<00:01:43.860> couple<00:01:44.190> so

00:01:44.330 --> 00:01:44.340 
that's like our favorite can a couple so

00:01:44.340 --> 00:01:45.140 
that's like our favorite can a couple so
we<00:01:44.430> don't<00:01:44.550> want<00:01:44.670> to<00:01:44.730> be<00:01:44.790> the<00:01:44.880> reason<00:01:45.120> that

00:01:45.140 --> 00:01:45.150 
we don't want to be the reason that

00:01:45.150 --> 00:01:47.090 
we don't want to be the reason that
doesn't<00:01:45.330> work<00:01:45.630> out<00:01:45.810> and<00:01:46.470> what<00:01:46.890> I<00:01:46.920> love<00:01:47.070> about

00:01:47.090 --> 00:01:47.100 
doesn't work out and what I love about

00:01:47.100 --> 00:01:48.650 
doesn't work out and what I love about
that<00:01:47.520> umbrella<00:01:47.760> especially<00:01:48.360> if<00:01:48.450> you're<00:01:48.540> in<00:01:48.600> a

00:01:48.650 --> 00:01:48.660 
that umbrella especially if you're in a

00:01:48.660 --> 00:01:50.030 
that umbrella especially if you're in a
situation<00:01:48.810> where<00:01:49.200> there's<00:01:49.350> draping<00:01:49.770> or

00:01:50.030 --> 00:01:50.040 
situation where there's draping or

00:01:50.040 --> 00:01:52.250 
situation where there's draping or
instead<00:01:50.430> of<00:01:50.490> white<00:01:50.730> walls<00:01:50.970> is<00:01:51.270> that<00:01:51.510> because

00:01:52.250 --> 00:01:52.260 
instead of white walls is that because

00:01:52.260 --> 00:01:53.630 
instead of white walls is that because
all<00:01:52.410> they're<00:01:52.530> seeing<00:01:52.710> is<00:01:52.890> that<00:01:53.070> outside<00:01:53.280> edge

00:01:53.630 --> 00:01:53.640 
all they're seeing is that outside edge

00:01:53.640 --> 00:01:56.990 
all they're seeing is that outside edge
