employ the active before you have five

00:02:06.980 --> 00:02:09.070 
employ the active before you have five
stacks<00:02:07.310> because<00:02:07.970> you<00:02:08.090> still<00:02:08.330> get<00:02:08.600> the<00:02:08.630> attack

00:02:09.070 --> 00:02:09.080

00:02:17.860 --> 00:02:17.870 
percent extra for four seconds it's just

00:02:17.870 --> 00:02:19.330 
percent extra for four seconds it's just
that<00:02:17.930> if<00:02:18.110> you<00:02:18.200> use<00:02:18.260> it<00:02:18.650> when<00:02:18.830> you<00:02:18.860> have<00:02:19.100> five

00:02:19.330 --> 00:02:19.340 
that if you use it when you have five

00:02:19.340 --> 00:02:22.660 
that if you use it when you have five
stacks<00:02:19.820> you<00:02:20.630> get<00:02:20.840> the<00:02:20.990> bonus<00:02:21.280> flurry<00:02:22.280> that

00:02:22.660 --> 00:02:22.670 
stacks you get the bonus flurry that

00:02:22.670 --> 00:02:25.690 
stacks you get the bonus flurry that
does<00:02:22.850> more<00:02:23.090> physical<00:02:23.540> damage<00:02:23.900> in<00:02:24.080> my<00:02:24.530> case<00:02:24.770> 219

00:02:25.690 --> 00:02:25.700 
does more physical damage in my case 219

00:02:25.700 --> 00:02:28.120 
does more physical damage in my case 219
so<00:02:26.210> essentially<00:02:26.840> you<00:02:26.990> want<00:02:27.230> to<00:02:27.320> make<00:02:27.440> sure<00:02:27.470> you

00:02:28.120 --> 00:02:28.130 
so essentially you want to make sure you

00:02:28.130 --> 00:02:31.560 
so essentially you want to make sure you
have<00:02:28.370> the<00:02:28.730> five<00:02:29.120> stacks<00:02:29.360> before<00:02:29.570> you<00:02:29.960> fight<00:02:30.560> so

00:02:31.560 --> 00:02:31.570 
have the five stacks before you fight so

00:02:31.570 --> 00:02:34.540 
have the five stacks before you fight so

going to employ our cue as you can see

00:02:41.210 --> 00:02:43.630 
going to employ our cue as you can see
attack<00:02:41.870> speed<00:02:42.170> steroid<00:02:42.680> and<00:02:42.920> we're<00:02:43.370> moving

00:02:43.640 --> 00:02:45.970 
attack speed steroid and we're moving
around<00:02:43.880> I'm<00:02:44.420> doing<00:02:44.690> more<00:02:44.840> damage<00:02:45.020> now<00:02:45.710> what's

00:02:45.970 --> 00:02:45.980 
around I'm doing more damage now what's

00:02:45.980 --> 00:02:48.760 
around I'm doing more damage now what's
kind<00:02:46.220> of<00:02:46.280> cool<00:02:46.340> is<00:02:46.730> that<00:02:46.760> your<00:02:47.480> volley<00:02:47.870> for

00:02:48.760 --> 00:02:48.770 
kind of cool is that your volley for

00:02:48.770 --> 00:02:51.730 
kind of cool is that your volley for
every<00:02:49.040> arrow<00:02:49.310> that<00:02:49.990> hits<00:02:50.990> an<00:02:51.470> enemy<00:02:51.560> champion

00:02:51.730 --> 00:02:51.740 
every arrow that hits an enemy champion

00:02:51.740 --> 00:02:53.740 
every arrow that hits an enemy champion
or<00:02:52.280> minion<00:02:52.640> you're<00:02:53.000> going<00:02:53.180> to<00:02:53.270> get<00:02:53.390> stacked

00:02:53.740 --> 00:02:53.750 
or minion you're going to get stacked

00:02:53.750 --> 00:02:56.590 
or minion you're going to get stacked
for<00:02:53.990> it<00:02:54.140> so<00:02:54.830> if<00:02:55.220> you<00:02:55.640> have<00:02:55.820> a<00:02:55.850> huge<00:02:56.240> way<00:02:56.450> the

00:02:56.590 --> 00:02:56.600 
for it so if you have a huge way the

00:02:56.600 --> 00:02:59.350 
for it so if you have a huge way the
minions<00:02:56.990> and<00:02:57.170> you<00:02:57.830> buy<00:02:58.400> of<00:02:58.580> your<00:02:58.730> volleys<00:02:59.120> hit

00:02:59.350 --> 00:02:59.360 
minions and you buy of your volleys hit

00:02:59.360 --> 00:03:01.690 
minions and you buy of your volleys hit
the<00:02:59.570> minions<00:03:00.260> you<00:03:00.890> get<00:03:01.010> five<00:03:01.220> stacks<00:03:01.490> right

00:03:01.690 --> 00:03:01.700 
the minions you get five stacks right

00:03:01.700 --> 00:03:03.699 
the minions you get five stacks right
away<00:03:01.940> so<00:03:02.450> let's<00:03:02.600> see<00:03:03.050> here<00:03:03.260> we'll<00:03:03.470> hit<00:03:03.560> these

00:03:03.699 --> 00:03:03.709 
away so let's see here we'll hit these

00:03:03.709 --> 00:03:06.610 
away so let's see here we'll hit these
three<00:03:03.950> in<00:03:04.010> the<00:03:04.070> back<00:03:04.190> and<00:03:04.930> two<00:03:05.930> in<00:03:06.050> my<00:03:06.170> case<00:03:06.380> we

00:03:06.610 --> 00:03:06.620 
three in the back and two in my case we

00:03:06.620 --> 00:03:08.440 
three in the back and two in my case we
have<00:03:06.709> two<00:03:06.890> stacks<00:03:07.160> right<00:03:07.340> off<00:03:07.430> the<00:03:07.580> bat<00:03:07.760> now

00:03:08.440 --> 00:03:08.450 
have two stacks right off the bat now

00:03:08.450 --> 00:03:10.600 
have two stacks right off the bat now
the<00:03:09.140> way<00:03:09.320> I<00:03:09.350> think<00:03:09.500> that<00:03:09.739> changes<00:03:10.190> the<00:03:10.489> way

00:03:10.600 --> 00:03:10.610 
the way I think that changes the way

00:03:10.610 --> 00:03:12.340 
the way I think that changes the way
she's<00:03:10.850> played<00:03:11.150> is<00:03:11.450> you're<00:03:11.959> going<00:03:12.080> to<00:03:12.140> want<00:03:12.290> to

00:03:12.340 --> 00:03:12.350 
she's played is you're going to want to

00:03:12.350 --> 00:03:15.160 
she's played is you're going to want to

00:03:15.160 --> 00:03:15.170 
open up with your frost shot and then

00:03:15.170 --> 00:03:17.410 
open up with your frost shot and then
get<00:03:15.380> five<00:03:15.560> stacks<00:03:15.830> real<00:03:16.100> quick<00:03:16.310> and<00:03:16.489> use<00:03:16.910> your

00:03:17.410 --> 00:03:17.420 
get five stacks real quick and use your

00:03:17.420 --> 00:03:21.250 
get five stacks real quick and use your
cue<00:03:17.810> and<00:03:18.400> so<00:03:19.400> going<00:03:20.120> back<00:03:20.390> to<00:03:20.450> our<00:03:20.660> passive<00:03:21.140> I

00:03:21.250 --> 00:03:21.260 
cue and so going back to our passive I

00:03:21.260 --> 00:03:23.680 
cue and so going back to our passive I
want<00:03:21.470> to<00:03:21.530> show<00:03:21.709> you<00:03:21.770> guys<00:03:21.890> something<00:03:22.850> kind<00:03:23.570> of

00:03:23.680 --> 00:03:23.690 
want to show you guys something kind of

00:03:23.690 --> 00:03:26.770 
want to show you guys something kind of
interesting<00:03:23.840> and<00:03:25.060> you<00:03:26.060> can<00:03:26.180> kind<00:03:26.300> of<00:03:26.420> visually

00:03:26.770 --> 00:03:26.780 
interesting and you can kind of visually

00:03:26.780 --> 00:03:28.750 
interesting and you can kind of visually
see<00:03:26.989> how<00:03:27.170> our<00:03:27.320> paso<00:03:27.680> works<00:03:27.890> so<00:03:28.459> we'll<00:03:28.610> see<00:03:28.730> how

00:03:28.750 --> 00:03:28.760 
see how our paso works so we'll see how

00:03:28.760 --> 00:03:30.280 
see how our paso works so we'll see how
much<00:03:28.970> damage<00:03:29.209> the<00:03:29.480> first<00:03:29.720> attack<00:03:30.050> does

00:03:30.280 --> 00:03:30.290 
much damage the first attack does

00:03:30.290 --> 00:03:33.400 
much damage the first attack does
without<00:03:30.560> the<00:03:30.770> crit<00:03:31.100> right<00:03:31.420> 155<00:03:32.420> now<00:03:33.050> I'm<00:03:33.170> doing

00:03:33.400 --> 00:03:33.410 
without the crit right 155 now I'm doing

00:03:33.410 --> 00:03:36.640 
without the crit right 155 now I'm doing
217<00:03:34.100> every<00:03:34.400> time<00:03:34.580> because<00:03:34.820> the<00:03:35.480> dragon<00:03:36.260> does

00:03:36.640 --> 00:03:36.650 
217 every time because the dragon does

00:03:36.650 --> 00:03:39.160 
217 every time because the dragon does
have<00:03:36.920> the<00:03:37.459> frost<00:03:37.790> active<00:03:38.360> on<00:03:38.480> it<00:03:38.660> and<00:03:38.810> so

00:03:39.160 --> 00:03:39.170 
have the frost active on it and so

00:03:39.170 --> 00:03:41.140 
have the frost active on it and so
you're<00:03:39.500> going<00:03:39.620> to<00:03:39.680> critically<00:03:40.100> strike<00:03:40.400> and<00:03:40.700> do

00:03:41.140 --> 00:03:41.150 
you're going to critically strike and do

00:03:41.150 --> 00:03:44.229 
you're going to critically strike and do
that<00:03:41.360> 110%<00:03:42.230> plus<00:03:42.980> thirty<00:03:43.250> percent<00:03:43.550> backbones

00:03:44.229 --> 00:03:44.239 
that 110% plus thirty percent backbones

00:03:44.239 --> 00:03:46.960 
that 110% plus thirty percent backbones
damage<00:03:44.690> now<00:03:45.470> what<00:03:45.650> you<00:03:45.680> can<00:03:45.800> do<00:03:46.130> is<00:03:46.400> instead<00:03:46.910> of

00:03:46.960 --> 00:03:46.970 
damage now what you can do is instead of

00:03:46.970 --> 00:03:49.509 
damage now what you can do is instead of
having<00:03:47.420> to<00:03:47.540> auto<00:03:47.840> first<00:03:48.410> and<00:03:48.709> then<00:03:49.160> the<00:03:49.190> next

00:03:49.509 --> 00:03:49.519 
having to auto first and then the next

00:03:49.519 --> 00:03:51.759 
having to auto first and then the next
attack<00:03:49.730> will<00:03:49.910> Chris<00:03:50.269> strike<00:03:50.540> you<00:03:51.170> can<00:03:51.350> open<00:03:51.560> up

00:03:51.759 --> 00:03:51.769 
attack will Chris strike you can open up

00:03:51.769 --> 00:03:53.770 
attack will Chris strike you can open up
with<00:03:51.950> your<00:03:52.070> volley<00:03:52.370> apply<00:03:53.030> the<00:03:53.090> frost<00:03:53.480> shot

00:03:53.770 --> 00:03:53.780 
with your volley apply the frost shot

00:03:53.780 --> 00:03:55.540 
with your volley apply the frost shot
and<00:03:54.019> then<00:03:54.530> your<00:03:54.680> next<00:03:54.800> attack<00:03:55.100> is<00:03:55.130> going<00:03:55.370> to<00:03:55.459> do

00:03:55.540 --> 00:03:55.550 
and then your next attack is going to do

00:03:55.550 --> 00:03:57.490 
and then your next attack is going to do
that<00:03:55.670> critical<00:03:56.030> strike<00:03:56.300> so<00:03:56.959> should<00:03:57.200> you<00:03:57.350> do

00:03:57.490 --> 00:03:57.500 
that critical strike so should you do

00:03:57.500 --> 00:04:00.100 
that critical strike so should you do
217<00:03:58.160> right<00:03:58.340> away<00:03:58.580> right<00:03:58.610> after<00:03:59.030> we<00:03:59.330> use<00:03:59.540> that

00:04:00.100 --> 00:04:00.110 
217 right away right after we use that

00:04:00.110 --> 00:04:03.370 
217 right away right after we use that
volley<00:04:00.410> ability<00:04:01.310> so<00:04:02.060> looking<00:04:02.390> over<00:04:02.600> those

00:04:03.370 --> 00:04:03.380 
volley ability so looking over those

00:04:03.380 --> 00:04:05.140 
volley ability so looking over those
three<00:04:03.410> abilities<00:04:04.010> you<00:04:04.400> get<00:04:04.519> a<00:04:04.550> kind<00:04:04.790> of<00:04:04.850> a<00:04:04.940> gist

00:04:05.140 --> 00:04:05.150 
three abilities you get a kind of a gist

00:04:05.150 --> 00:04:07.870 
three abilities you get a kind of a gist
of<00:04:05.269> how<00:04:05.390> they<00:04:05.540> work<00:04:05.690> now<00:04:06.140> going<00:04:06.470> over<00:04:06.890> e<00:04:07.100> /<00:04:07.670> Hawk

00:04:07.870 --> 00:04:07.880 
of how they work now going over e / Hawk

00:04:07.880 --> 00:04:10.509 
of how they work now going over e / Hawk
shot<00:04:08.150> you<00:04:08.450> no<00:04:08.660> longer<00:04:08.989> get<00:04:09.440> money<00:04:09.859> after<00:04:10.430> you

00:04:10.509 --> 00:04:10.519 
shot you no longer get money after you

00:04:10.519 --> 00:04:11.590 
shot you no longer get money after you
kill<00:04:10.790> unit

00:04:11.590 --> 00:04:11.600 
kill unit

00:04:11.600 --> 00:04:13.960 
kill unit
actually<00:04:11.990> I<00:04:12.200> think<00:04:12.470> upgrade<00:04:13.340> it<00:04:13.550> to<00:04:13.580> where

00:04:13.960 --> 00:04:13.970 
actually I think upgrade it to where

00:04:13.970 --> 00:04:15.940 
actually I think upgrade it to where
it's<00:04:14.150> a<00:04:14.210> global<00:04:14.540> ability<00:04:15.200> so<00:04:15.680> you<00:04:15.740> can

00:04:15.940 --> 00:04:15.950 
it's a global ability so you can

00:04:15.950 --> 00:04:19.090 
it's a global ability so you can
actually<00:04:16.100> check<00:04:16.520> out<00:04:16.760> Baron<00:04:17.720> from<00:04:18.260> level<00:04:18.620> 1<00:04:18.830> or

00:04:19.090 --> 00:04:19.100 
actually check out Baron from level 1 or

00:04:19.100 --> 00:04:21.370 
actually check out Baron from level 1 or
you<00:04:20.030> know<00:04:20.150> right<00:04:20.540> there<00:04:20.690> at<00:04:20.810> their<00:04:20.930> red<00:04:21.170> buff

00:04:21.370 --> 00:04:21.380 
you know right there at their red buff

00:04:21.380 --> 00:04:24.070 
you know right there at their red buff
and<00:04:21.820> so<00:04:22.820> you're<00:04:23.030> still<00:04:23.390> going<00:04:23.600> to<00:04:23.660> level<00:04:23.870> at

00:04:24.070 --> 00:04:24.080 
and so you're still going to level at

00:04:24.080 --> 00:04:27.150 
and so you're still going to level at
last<00:04:24.320> but<00:04:24.710> what's<00:04:24.890> going<00:04:25.130> to<00:04:25.190> do<00:04:25.400> is<00:04:25.750> I<00:04:26.750> think

00:04:27.150 --> 00:04:27.160 
last but what's going to do is I think

00:04:27.160 --> 00:04:29.320 
last but what's going to do is I think
higher<00:04:28.160> level<00:04:28.550> allow<00:04:28.700> you<00:04:28.760> to<00:04:28.910> track<00:04:29.150> their

00:04:29.320 --> 00:04:29.330 
higher level allow you to track their

00:04:29.330 --> 00:04:31.540 
higher level allow you to track their
jungler<00:04:29.660> earlier<00:04:30.410> in<00:04:30.500> the<00:04:30.620> game<00:04:30.650> and<00:04:31.070> provide

00:04:31.540 --> 00:04:31.550 
jungler earlier in the game and provide

00:04:31.550 --> 00:04:34.870 
jungler earlier in the game and provide
more<00:04:31.940> strategy<00:04:32.450> as<00:04:32.720> far<00:04:33.470> as<00:04:33.710> you<00:04:34.520> know<00:04:34.610> if<00:04:34.670> top

00:04:34.870 --> 00:04:34.880 
more strategy as far as you know if top

00:04:34.880 --> 00:04:36.880 
more strategy as far as you know if top
line<00:04:35.090> needs<00:04:35.270> to<00:04:35.360> stay<00:04:35.420> back<00:04:35.780> or<00:04:36.020> whatever<00:04:36.740> the

00:04:36.880 --> 00:04:36.890 
line needs to stay back or whatever the

00:04:36.890 --> 00:04:38.980 
line needs to stay back or whatever the
case<00:04:36.920> is<00:04:37.370> just<00:04:37.940> having<00:04:38.180> more<00:04:38.420> vision<00:04:38.780> on<00:04:38.960> a

00:04:38.980 --> 00:04:38.990 
case is just having more vision on a

00:04:38.990 --> 00:04:41.560 
case is just having more vision on a
more<00:04:39.260> global<00:04:39.410> scale<00:04:39.830> will<00:04:40.190> be<00:04:40.310> better<00:04:40.460> now<00:04:41.300> her

00:04:41.560 --> 00:04:41.570 
more global scale will be better now her

00:04:41.570 --> 00:04:43.360 
more global scale will be better now her
ultimate<00:04:41.990> is<00:04:42.140> exactly<00:04:42.680> the<00:04:42.830> same<00:04:43.040> no<00:04:43.340> change

00:04:43.360 --> 00:04:43.370 
ultimate is exactly the same no change

00:04:43.370 --> 00:04:46.710 
ultimate is exactly the same no change
there<00:04:43.940> so<00:04:44.540> you<00:04:45.260> can<00:04:45.410> go<00:04:45.530> ahead<00:04:45.620> and<00:04:45.740> snipe<00:04:46.100> away

00:04:46.710 --> 00:04:46.720 
there so you can go ahead and snipe away

00:04:46.720 --> 00:04:50.890 
there so you can go ahead and snipe away
but<00:04:47.720> let's<00:04:48.230> go<00:04:48.410> tag-team<00:04:49.010> these<00:04:49.520> two<00:04:49.790> and<00:04:50.090> show

00:04:50.890 --> 00:04:50.900 
but let's go tag-team these two and show

00:04:50.900 --> 00:04:51.940 
but let's go tag-team these two and show
you<00:04:50.990> what's<00:04:51.170> all<00:04:51.290> about<00:04:51.470> so<00:04:51.710> I'm<00:04:51.800> going<00:04:51.920> to

00:04:51.940 --> 00:04:51.950 
you what's all about so I'm going to

00:04:51.950 --> 00:04:53.980 
you what's all about so I'm going to
open<00:04:52.100> up<00:04:52.370> with<00:04:53.210> probably<00:04:53.600> what's<00:04:53.750> going<00:04:53.900> to

00:04:53.980 --> 00:04:53.990 
open up with probably what's going to

00:04:53.990 --> 00:04:55.750 
open up with probably what's going to
happen<00:04:54.260> is<00:04:54.380> I'm<00:04:54.470> gonna<00:04:54.530> arrow<00:04:54.800> open<00:04:55.550> up<00:04:55.610> with

00:04:55.750 --> 00:04:55.760 
happen is I'm gonna arrow open up with

00:04:55.760 --> 00:05:00.190 
happen is I'm gonna arrow open up with
volley<00:04:56.030> get<00:04:56.360> my<00:04:56.510> stacks<00:04:56.870> up<00:04:57.110> real<00:04:57.380> quick<00:04:59.200> five

00:05:00.190 --> 00:05:00.200 
volley get my stacks up real quick five

00:05:00.200 --> 00:05:03.490 
volley get my stacks up real quick five
stacks<00:05:00.500> and<00:05:00.770> then<00:05:00.950> launch<00:05:01.220> Q<00:05:01.520> and<00:05:01.790> Q<00:05:02.510> is<00:05:03.050> up<00:05:03.260> you

00:05:03.490 --> 00:05:03.500 
stacks and then launch Q and Q is up you

00:05:03.500 --> 00:05:06.370 
stacks and then launch Q and Q is up you
do<00:05:03.710> more<00:05:04.040> tax<00:05:04.250> feed<00:05:04.520> your<00:05:05.120> frost<00:05:05.480> shot<00:05:05.750> slows

00:05:06.370 --> 00:05:06.380 
do more tax feed your frost shot slows

00:05:06.380 --> 00:05:09.100 
do more tax feed your frost shot slows
more<00:05:06.650> and<00:05:07.360> so<00:05:08.360> it's<00:05:08.570> going<00:05:08.690> to<00:05:08.750> be<00:05:08.870> huge

00:05:09.100 --> 00:05:09.110 
more and so it's going to be huge

00:05:09.110 --> 00:05:11.860 
more and so it's going to be huge
steroid<00:05:09.650> but<00:05:10.220> again<00:05:10.340> 18<00:05:11.000> second<00:05:11.330> cooldown<00:05:11.600> so

00:05:11.860 --> 00:05:11.870 
steroid but again 18 second cooldown so

00:05:11.870 --> 00:05:13.210 
steroid but again 18 second cooldown so
you're<00:05:12.020> probably<00:05:12.230> only<00:05:12.470> going<00:05:12.590> to<00:05:12.860> use<00:05:12.890> it

00:05:13.210 --> 00:05:13.220 
you're probably only going to use it

00:05:13.220 --> 00:05:14.860 
you're probably only going to use it
once<00:05:13.790> in<00:05:13.970> the<00:05:14.090> fight<00:05:14.270> so<00:05:14.510> you<00:05:14.600> want<00:05:14.780> to<00:05:14.840> be

00:05:14.860 --> 00:05:14.870 
once in the fight so you want to be

00:05:14.870 --> 00:05:17.200 
once in the fight so you want to be
smart<00:05:15.230> when<00:05:15.440> you<00:05:15.590> use<00:05:15.800> it<00:05:16.010> as<00:05:16.220> you<00:05:16.970> can<00:05:17.060> see<00:05:17.150> I

00:05:17.200 --> 00:05:17.210 
smart when you use it as you can see I

00:05:17.210 --> 00:05:19.540 
smart when you use it as you can see I
have<00:05:17.240> five<00:05:17.570> stacks<00:05:17.810> but<00:05:17.990> I'll<00:05:18.080> have<00:05:18.170> hewa<00:05:18.550> so

00:05:19.540 --> 00:05:19.550 
have five stacks but I'll have hewa so

00:05:19.550 --> 00:05:21.760 
have five stacks but I'll have hewa so
that's<00:05:19.820> it<00:05:20.030> guys<00:05:20.110> hopefully<00:05:21.110> you<00:05:21.320> kind<00:05:21.560> of<00:05:21.590> get

00:05:21.760 --> 00:05:21.770 
that's it guys hopefully you kind of get

00:05:21.770 --> 00:05:23.740 
that's it guys hopefully you kind of get
a<00:05:21.830> better<00:05:22.010> understanding<00:05:22.100> of<00:05:22.730> her<00:05:23.120> skills<00:05:23.510> I'm

00:05:23.740 --> 00:05:23.750 
a better understanding of her skills I'm
