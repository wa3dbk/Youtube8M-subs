00:05:19.010 --> 00:05:19.020 
breathe the book before watching the

00:05:19.020 --> 00:05:21.350 
breathe the book before watching the
movie<00:05:19.409> because<00:05:19.800> you'll<00:05:20.159> love<00:05:20.669> the<00:05:20.879> movie<00:05:21.150> so

movie because you'll love the movie so

00:05:21.360 --> 00:05:23.300 
movie because you'll love the movie so
much<00:05:21.539> more<00:05:21.810> I<00:05:21.870> think<00:05:21.990> before<00:05:22.710> I<00:05:22.740> always<00:05:23.159> like

00:05:23.300 --> 00:05:23.310 
much more I think before I always like

00:05:23.310 --> 00:05:25.399 
much more I think before I always like
if<00:05:23.520> I<00:05:23.639> really<00:05:23.969> like<00:05:24.150> a<00:05:24.180> book<00:05:24.389> I<00:05:24.509> like<00:05:24.719> to<00:05:25.229> read

00:05:25.399 --> 00:05:25.409 
if I really like a book I like to read

00:05:25.409 --> 00:05:27.439 
if I really like a book I like to read
it<00:05:25.560> before<00:05:25.680> the<00:05:25.919> movie<00:05:26.189> because<00:05:26.310> it<00:05:26.909> just<00:05:27.150> I

00:05:27.439 --> 00:05:27.449 
it before the movie because it just I

00:05:27.449 --> 00:05:28.790 
it before the movie because it just I
don't<00:05:27.509> know<00:05:27.689> it's<00:05:27.749> just<00:05:28.050> so<00:05:28.289> different<00:05:28.589> when

00:05:28.790 --> 00:05:28.800 
don't know it's just so different when

00:05:28.800 --> 00:05:30.980 
don't know it's just so different when
you<00:05:28.889> actually<00:05:29.069> read<00:05:29.430> the<00:05:29.520> book<00:05:29.699> and<00:05:29.990> sometimes

00:05:30.980 --> 00:05:30.990 
you actually read the book and sometimes

00:05:30.990 --> 00:05:32.510 
you actually read the book and sometimes
they<00:05:31.139> play<00:05:31.379> things<00:05:31.650> out<00:05:31.800> differently<00:05:32.219> in<00:05:32.430> the

00:05:32.510 --> 00:05:32.520 
they play things out differently in the

00:05:32.520 --> 00:05:34.429 
they play things out differently in the
movie<00:05:32.819> so<00:05:33.029> definitely<00:05:33.449> read<00:05:34.110> the<00:05:34.259> book<00:05:34.409> first

00:05:34.429 --> 00:05:34.439 
movie so definitely read the book first

00:05:34.439 --> 00:05:36.079 
movie so definitely read the book first
