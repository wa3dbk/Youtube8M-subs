00:00:55.260 --> 00:00:55.270 

00:00:55.270 --> 00:00:57.000

00:00:57.010 --> 00:01:01.290 
so we scroll around here you'll see on
the<00:00:57.100> bottom<00:00:57.250> you'll<00:00:57.640> see<00:01:00.030> these<00:01:01.030> are<00:01:01.180> all

00:01:01.290 --> 00:01:01.300 
the bottom you'll see these are all

00:01:01.300 --> 00:01:04.439

quick<00:01:01.510> launches<00:01:01.930> the<00:01:02.590> the<00:01:03.100> squad<00:01:03.880> is<00:01:03.910> a<00:01:04.089> little

00:01:04.439 --> 00:01:04.449 
quick launches the the squad is a little

00:01:04.449 --> 00:01:06.660 
quick launches the the squad is a little
just<00:01:05.320> different<00:01:05.800> to<00:01:05.860> get<00:01:05.980> all<00:01:06.100> the<00:01:06.220> pluses<00:01:06.490> of

00:01:06.660 --> 00:01:06.670 
just different to get all the pluses of

00:01:06.670 --> 00:01:08.130 
just different to get all the pluses of
new<00:01:06.880> screens<00:01:07.210> so<00:01:07.390> I<00:01:07.450> think<00:01:07.540> there<00:01:07.810> might<00:01:07.960> be<00:01:08.020> a

00:01:08.130 --> 00:01:08.140 
new screens so I think there might be a

00:01:08.140 --> 00:01:09.630 
new screens so I think there might be a
little<00:01:08.350> material<00:01:08.800> on<00:01:09.010> the<00:01:09.070> screen<00:01:09.280> i<00:01:09.310> took<00:01:09.520> the

00:01:09.630 --> 00:01:09.640 
little material on the screen i took the

00:01:09.640 --> 00:01:11.880 
little material on the screen i took the
screen<00:01:09.820> saver<00:01:10.030> off<00:01:10.240> but<00:01:10.510> it<00:01:11.380> seems<00:01:11.560> like<00:01:11.620> gifts

00:01:11.880 --> 00:01:11.890 
screen saver off but it seems like gifts

00:01:11.890 --> 00:01:14.070 
screen saver off but it seems like gifts
apply<00:01:12.070> a<00:01:12.100> little<00:01:12.400> pressure<00:01:12.520> to<00:01:13.000> it<00:01:13.150> um<00:01:13.300> it's

00:01:14.070 --> 00:01:14.080 
apply a little pressure to it um it's

00:01:14.080 --> 00:01:17.250 
apply a little pressure to it um it's
just<00:01:14.260> like<00:01:14.380> the<00:01:14.470> touch<00:01:14.620> cruise<00:01:15.630> from<00:01:16.630> from<00:01:17.140> the

00:01:17.250 --> 00:01:17.260 
just like the touch cruise from from the

00:01:17.260 --> 00:01:20.310 
just like the touch cruise from from the
screen<00:01:17.680> kind<00:01:18.040> of<00:01:18.690> perspective<00:01:19.690> what<00:01:20.140> you<00:01:20.229> have

00:01:20.310 --> 00:01:20.320

device is a little on the slow side

00:02:38.830 --> 00:02:41.500 
device is a little on the slow side
can't<00:02:39.830> really<00:02:39.980> make<00:02:40.100> that<00:02:40.280> out<00:02:40.490> not<00:02:41.330> really

00:02:41.500 --> 00:02:41.510 
can't really make that out not really

00:02:41.510 --> 00:02:42.910 
can't really make that out not really
sure<00:02:41.660> you<00:02:42.230> know<00:02:42.320> this<00:02:42.470> is<00:02:42.530> a<00:02:42.650> production

device<00:02:43.370> but<00:02:43.670> and<00:02:44.630> it<00:02:44.780> seems<00:02:44.990> like<00:02:45.140> it's<00:02:45.290> really

00:02:45.600 --> 00:02:45.610 
device but and it seems like it's really

00:02:45.610 --> 00:02:47.980 
device but and it seems like it's really
dodging<00:02:46.610> so<00:02:46.820> it<00:02:46.940> might<00:02:47.090> just<00:02:47.240> be<00:02:47.420> an<00:02:47.510> early<00:02:47.780> rom

00:02:47.980 --> 00:02:47.990
