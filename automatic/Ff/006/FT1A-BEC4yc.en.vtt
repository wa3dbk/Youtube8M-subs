00:00:03.400 --> 00:00:20.609 

I<00:00:18.030> think<00:00:19.030> Harvard<00:00:19.360> is<00:00:19.570> perfectly<00:00:20.050> positioned

00:00:20.609 --> 00:00:20.619 
I think Harvard is perfectly positioned

00:00:20.619 --> 00:00:22.740 
I think Harvard is perfectly positioned
to<00:00:20.679> be<00:00:20.890> leading<00:00:21.099> this<00:00:21.460> new<00:00:21.730> form<00:00:22.179> of<00:00:22.330> teaching

00:00:22.740 --> 00:00:22.750 
to be leading this new form of teaching

00:00:22.750 --> 00:00:24.990 
to be leading this new form of teaching
and<00:00:22.929> the<00:00:22.960> reasons<00:00:23.859> are<00:00:24.160> that<00:00:24.189> we<00:00:24.550> have<00:00:24.759> this

00:00:24.990 --> 00:00:25.000 
and the reasons are that we have this

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:26.579 
and the reasons are that we have this
great<00:00:25.179> history<00:00:25.539> of<00:00:25.630> experimentation<00:00:26.320> and

00:00:26.579 --> 00:00:26.589 
great history of experimentation and

00:00:26.589 --> 00:00:28.320 
great history of experimentation and
learning<00:00:26.919> and<00:00:27.070> in<00:00:27.160> fact<00:00:27.369> we<00:00:27.849> have<00:00:27.939> a<00:00:27.970> history

00:00:28.320 --> 00:00:28.330 
learning and in fact we have a history

00:00:28.330 --> 00:00:30.269 
learning and in fact we have a history
of<00:00:28.359> moving<00:00:29.050> the<00:00:29.230> ball<00:00:29.349> forward<00:00:29.410> with<00:00:29.890> pedagogy

00:00:30.269 --> 00:00:30.279 
of moving the ball forward with pedagogy

00:00:30.279 --> 00:00:32.550 
of moving the ball forward with pedagogy
we<00:00:30.820> also<00:00:30.999> are<00:00:31.300> a<00:00:31.330> place<00:00:31.570> that<00:00:31.929> prides

00:00:32.550 --> 00:00:32.560 
we also are a place that prides

00:00:32.560 --> 00:00:34.710 
we also are a place that prides
ourselves<00:00:32.710> on<00:00:33.250> building<00:00:33.700> from<00:00:33.940> tradition<00:00:34.450> or

to be understood within this community
as<00:00:40.390> a<00:00:40.870> fundamental<00:00:41.860> part<00:00:42.490> of<00:00:42.580> who<00:00:43.060> we<00:00:43.090> are<00:00:43.420> and

as a fundamental part of who we are and

fundamental part of Harvard's identity I

00:00:48.490 --> 00:00:50.370 
fundamental part of Harvard's identity I
think<00:00:48.760> students<00:00:49.120> expect<00:00:49.780> something

00:00:50.370 --> 00:00:50.380 
think students expect something

00:00:50.380 --> 00:00:51.480 
think students expect something
different<00:00:50.530> when<00:00:50.950> they<00:00:51.040> walk<00:00:51.190> into<00:00:51.400> a

00:00:51.480 --> 00:00:51.490 
different when they walk into a

00:00:51.490 --> 00:00:54.120 
different when they walk into a
classroom<00:00:51.700> and<00:00:52.030> and<00:00:52.840> they<00:00:53.200> might<00:00:53.410> even<00:00:53.680> need

00:00:54.120 --> 00:00:54.130 
classroom and and they might even need

00:00:54.130 --> 00:00:55.710 
classroom and and they might even need
something<00:00:54.700> different<00:00:55.090> in<00:00:55.240> order<00:00:55.450> to<00:00:55.600> learn

00:00:55.710 --> 00:00:55.720 
something different in order to learn

00:00:55.720 --> 00:00:58.560 
something different in order to learn
effectively<00:00:56.230> i<00:00:56.500> would<00:00:56.770> say<00:00:56.980> 99.9<00:00:57.970> percent<00:00:58.390> of

00:00:58.560 --> 00:00:58.570 
effectively i would say 99.9 percent of

00:00:58.570 --> 00:01:02.250 
effectively i would say 99.9 percent of
use<00:00:58.960> of<00:00:59.170> technology<00:01:00.040> education<00:01:00.330> are<00:01:01.330> simply<00:01:01.900> a

00:01:02.250 --> 00:01:02.260 
use of technology education are simply a

00:01:02.260 --> 00:01:05.160 
use of technology education are simply a
new<00:01:02.830> way<00:01:03.070> of<00:01:03.100> doing<00:01:03.310> all<00:01:03.730> things<00:01:04.030> so<00:01:05.019> i've

00:01:05.160 --> 00:01:05.170 
new way of doing all things so i've

00:01:05.170 --> 00:01:06.600 
new way of doing all things so i've
always<00:01:05.530> been<00:01:05.680> looking<00:01:05.860> at<00:01:06.189> uses<00:01:06.520> of

00:01:06.600 --> 00:01:06.610 
always been looking at uses of

00:01:06.610 --> 00:01:08.370 
always been looking at uses of
technology<00:01:06.640> that<00:01:07.150> facilitate<00:01:07.930> things<00:01:08.140> that

00:01:08.370 --> 00:01:08.380 
technology that facilitate things that

00:01:08.380 --> 00:01:11.010 
technology that facilitate things that
cannot<00:01:08.830> be<00:01:09.100> done<00:01:09.460> the<00:01:09.820> old<00:01:09.970> way<00:01:10.270> it's<00:01:10.630> a<00:01:10.720> time

00:01:11.010 --> 00:01:11.020 
cannot be done the old way it's a time

00:01:11.020 --> 00:01:13.710 
cannot be done the old way it's a time
for<00:01:11.050> us<00:01:11.320> to<00:01:11.710> think<00:01:12.370> about<00:01:12.610> the<00:01:12.850> best<00:01:13.120> ways<00:01:13.450> of

00:01:13.710 --> 00:01:13.720 
for us to think about the best ways of

00:01:13.720 --> 00:01:15.450 
for us to think about the best ways of
using<00:01:13.930> these<00:01:14.230> new<00:01:14.440> tools<00:01:14.680> that<00:01:15.010> students<00:01:15.370> are

00:01:15.450 --> 00:01:15.460 
using these new tools that students are

00:01:15.460 --> 00:01:17.550 
using these new tools that students are
in<00:01:15.790> many<00:01:16.000> cases<00:01:16.360> more<00:01:16.570> familiar<00:01:16.990> with<00:01:17.020> that<00:01:17.200> we

00:01:17.550 --> 00:01:17.560 
in many cases more familiar with that we

00:01:17.560 --> 00:01:19.590 
in many cases more familiar with that we
are<00:01:17.740> in<00:01:18.130> making<00:01:18.670> sure<00:01:18.700> that<00:01:19.060> we<00:01:19.180> are<00:01:19.300> offering

00:01:19.590 --> 00:01:19.600 
are in making sure that we are offering

00:01:19.600 --> 00:01:22.860 
are in making sure that we are offering
them<00:01:20.050> the<00:01:20.080> best<00:01:20.530> ways<00:01:20.920> to<00:01:21.310> get<00:01:22.210> into<00:01:22.720> the

00:01:22.860 --> 00:01:22.870 
them the best ways to get into the

00:01:22.870 --> 00:01:24.780 
them the best ways to get into the
knowledge<00:01:23.170> we<00:01:23.350> want<00:01:23.560> them<00:01:23.710> to<00:01:23.890> understand<00:01:24.370> we

00:01:24.780 --> 00:01:24.790 
knowledge we want them to understand we

00:01:24.790 --> 00:01:27.440 
knowledge we want them to understand we
got<00:01:24.970> very<00:01:25.270> much<00:01:25.570> caught<00:01:25.870> up<00:01:26.020> in<00:01:26.200> the<00:01:26.320> idea<00:01:26.350> of

00:01:27.440 --> 00:01:27.450 
got very much caught up in the idea of

00:01:27.450 --> 00:01:30.930 
got very much caught up in the idea of
bringing<00:01:28.450> university<00:01:29.380> together<00:01:29.620> that<00:01:30.370> all<00:01:30.580> of

00:01:30.930 --> 00:01:30.940 
bringing university together that all of

00:01:30.940 --> 00:01:33.600 
bringing university together that all of
its<00:01:31.120> parts<00:01:31.540> were<00:01:31.780> would<00:01:32.470> work<00:01:32.710> much<00:01:32.740> better<00:01:33.010> if

00:01:33.600 --> 00:01:33.610 
its parts were would work much better if

00:01:33.610 --> 00:01:36.149 
its parts were would work much better if
everyone<00:01:34.110> collaborated<00:01:35.110> bring<00:01:35.560> even<00:01:35.860> more<00:01:35.890> of

00:01:36.149 --> 00:01:36.159 
everyone collaborated bring even more of
