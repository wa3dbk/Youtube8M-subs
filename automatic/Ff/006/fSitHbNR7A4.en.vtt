00:00:04.660 --> 00:00:12.700
 So let's go to the blues scale now. 

00:00:08.200 --> 00:00:15.140
 Blu-scale're not you see Oh Can I have onge 

00:00:12.700 --> 00:00:18.560
 4 

00:00:15.140 --> 00:00:21.160
 Aia y example c 

00:00:18.560 --> 00:00:21.160
 Why this reserve 

00:00:21.570 --> 00:00:30.930
 Yeah. Yeah. 

00:00:25.380 --> 00:00:35.580
 So what is it about, but what is not public ? 

00:00:30.930 --> 00:00:36.300
 Well , then you can think of these six as being used. 

00:00:35.580 --> 00:00:40.170
 Urine 

00:00:36.300 --> 00:00:43.350
 Notice the word blue here. 

00:00:40.170 --> 00:00:46.710
 One more depressed meaning of Lou is added 

00:00:43.350 --> 00:00:54.690
 What are you talking about? 

00:00:46.710 --> 00:00:59.210
 Well, there is a case where one note is added in the middle. 

00:00:54.690 --> 00:00:59.210
 Here is a semitone added to the salmon 

00:01:00.420 --> 00:01:08.660
 Now , let's compare the minor-pentatonic and blue skills. 

00:01:05.759 --> 00:01:08.660
 Pattern 

00:01:09.600 --> 00:01:12.200
 blues 

00:01:13.170 --> 00:01:17.910
 Right now 

00:01:15.570 --> 00:01:23.030
 Come on in. Come on. 

00:01:17.910 --> 00:01:23.030
 It's borrowed. 

00:01:25.770 --> 00:01:34.020
 It would be doubly depressing due to the addition of one more. 

00:01:30.030 --> 00:01:38.100
 I guess this is why the Blues Scale Limit has been earned. 

00:01:34.020 --> 00:01:41.549
 Okay. Let's get it together again. 

00:01:38.100 --> 00:01:44.360
 How pentatonik preheated doeja 

00:01:41.549 --> 00:01:44.360
 Doremi Solar 

00:01:44.369 --> 00:01:59.610
 38 For the tonic minor pentatonik just 236 Post another half 

00:01:52.950 --> 00:02:04.979
 Then I'll go right to the name Tom Black #'m just over 

00:01:59.610 --> 00:02:07.860
 Then what's the next thing to shoot ? 

00:02:04.979 --> 00:02:11.640
 Arara 

00:02:07.860 --> 00:02:14.730
 So I think that's how it is. 

00:02:11.640 --> 00:02:20.640
 And the last blueskale. 

00:02:14.730 --> 00:02:23.680
 In the middle is meant to be a chuch and what a late-night minor pentatonic 

00:02:20.640 --> 00:02:27.400
 I'll see you. 

00:02:23.680 --> 00:02:31.920
 Pachaj Gach Parser Pak Shirt 

00:02:27.400 --> 00:02:36.370
 So rolls oh and why 

00:02:31.920 --> 00:02:39.370
 Papa # Shell Ai 

00:02:36.370 --> 00:02:46.049
 That 's six points. 

00:02:39.370 --> 00:02:46.049
 This is only if you understand the scale party really even Ying
