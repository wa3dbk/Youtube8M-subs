00:05:12.339 --> 00:05:12.349 
far as I'm concerned punch sounds right

00:05:12.349 --> 00:05:14.140 
far as I'm concerned punch sounds right
the<00:05:12.500> white<00:05:12.680> concession<00:05:13.340> the<00:05:13.699> fact<00:05:13.940> that<00:05:14.000> the

00:05:14.140 --> 00:05:14.150 
the white concession the fact that the

00:05:14.150 --> 00:05:16.830 
the white concession the fact that the
better<00:05:14.330> ground<00:05:14.539> will<00:05:14.810> suit<00:05:15.020> punches<00:05:15.440> towns<00:05:15.710> I

00:05:16.830 --> 00:05:16.840 
better ground will suit punches towns I

00:05:16.840 --> 00:05:19.480 
better ground will suit punches towns I
think<00:05:17.840> if<00:05:17.900> you<00:05:17.990> the<00:05:18.500> reverse<00:05:18.770> forecast<00:05:19.250> is<00:05:19.400> the

00:05:19.480 --> 00:05:19.490 
think if you the reverse forecast is the

00:05:19.490 --> 00:05:20.770 
think if you the reverse forecast is the
obviously<00:05:19.820> I<00:05:19.880> think<00:05:20.120> the<00:05:20.180> two<00:05:20.330> are<00:05:20.360> absolute

00:05:20.770 --> 00:05:20.780 
obviously I think the two are absolute

00:05:20.780 --> 00:05:22.750 
obviously I think the two are absolute
standouts<00:05:21.349> against<00:05:21.680> the<00:05:21.889> others<00:05:22.190> can't

00:05:22.750 --> 00:05:22.760 
standouts against the others can't

00:05:22.760 --> 00:05:24.310 
standouts against the others can't
possibly<00:05:23.090> see<00:05:23.330> a<00:05:23.360> way<00:05:23.510> that<00:05:23.690> big<00:05:23.810> bucks<00:05:24.050> can

00:05:24.310 --> 00:05:24.320 
possibly see a way that big bucks can

00:05:24.320 --> 00:05:26.110 
possibly see a way that big bucks can
can<00:05:24.740> reverse<00:05:25.010> it<00:05:25.250> in<00:05:25.460> terms<00:05:25.729> of<00:05:25.880> the<00:05:25.970> white

00:05:26.110 --> 00:05:26.120 
can reverse it in terms of the white

00:05:26.120 --> 00:05:28.000 
can reverse it in terms of the white
