00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.570
 so that May I had the good invited me to 

00:00:01.650 --> 00:00:06.240
 subscribe to my channel decided it 

00:00:03.570 --> 00:00:08.790
 I will teach how to insert the micro sd to 

00:00:06.240 --> 00:00:10.440
 samsung galaxy one phone is the input 

00:00:08.790 --> 00:00:14.490
 that I have in reference hand that is 

00:00:10.440 --> 00:00:17.180
 of 58 30 that phone is very simple 

00:00:14.490 --> 00:00:19.350
 the cabin with a micro SD of 2GB 

00:00:17.180 --> 00:00:22.380
 inserting it is very simple simply 

00:00:19.350 --> 00:00:23.939
 you are to rope this slot my advice 

00:00:22.380 --> 00:00:26.310
 is that they turn off the phone before 

00:00:23.939 --> 00:00:28.590
 insert the micro sd then what 

00:00:26.310 --> 00:00:30.029
 let's do is first check like this 

00:00:28.590 --> 00:00:33.480
 that here by configuration and 

00:00:30.029 --> 00:00:35.550
 storage that there really is not a 

00:00:33.480 --> 00:00:37.590
 and insert as we can see above 

00:00:35.550 --> 00:00:38.850
 We have the information on the card 

00:00:37.590 --> 00:00:41.430
 memory 

00:00:38.850 --> 00:00:43.559
 it's so total space not available here 

00:00:41.430 --> 00:00:45.180
 a memories task is inserted below the 

00:00:43.559 --> 00:00:47.120
 space available the phone 

00:00:45.180 --> 00:00:49.589
 internally then we will pay 

00:00:47.120 --> 00:00:53.640
 micro sd interface and relearn the 

00:00:49.589 --> 00:00:56.480
 phone we turn off the phone we accept 

00:00:53.640 --> 00:00:56.480
 the micro sd 

00:00:59.450 --> 00:01:04.790
 we uncover here the slot of the micro sd 

00:01:02.480 --> 00:01:07.250
 in the nail we can easily uncover it 

00:01:04.790 --> 00:01:09.560
 sometimes it's much simpler if 

00:01:07.250 --> 00:01:12.140
 we remove the lid which can be 

00:01:09.560 --> 00:01:16.220
 breathe a lot very easily like this now 

00:01:12.140 --> 00:01:18.800
 we throw the lid and so this 

00:01:16.220 --> 00:01:20.840
 those little landmarks flips easily 

00:01:18.800 --> 00:01:23.420
 towards this side 

00:01:20.840 --> 00:01:25.399
 without having to lift it much thread to 

00:01:23.420 --> 00:01:27.950
 breaking many times has raised a lot 

00:01:25.399 --> 00:01:30.020
 remove it put the mind we finished that 

00:01:27.950 --> 00:01:32.600
 they will see the pieces but if we remove the 

00:01:30.020 --> 00:01:35.780
 lid is easily decanted up 

00:01:32.600 --> 00:01:37.579
 then flip down to insert 

00:01:35.780 --> 00:01:40.729
 to the microsd we take the phone in this 

00:01:37.579 --> 00:01:44.780
 meaning and we insert it with the 

00:01:40.729 --> 00:01:46.540
 information towards us that is to say with 

00:01:44.780 --> 00:01:48.820
 the teeth of the metal parts 

00:01:46.540 --> 00:01:50.650
 down 

00:01:48.820 --> 00:01:54.420
 logically the new reference is 

00:01:50.650 --> 00:01:56.759
 uncertain in this sense we enter 

00:01:54.420 --> 00:02:00.740
 the slot you have to have a little bit of 

00:01:56.759 --> 00:02:04.060
 nail scream the one that is s to arrive 

00:02:00.740 --> 00:02:06.040
 pretty much to the bottom 

00:02:04.060 --> 00:02:08.649
 and we insert it until we hear a 

00:02:06.040 --> 00:02:09.880
 click immediately we hear a click 

00:02:08.649 --> 00:02:11.950
 We know that memory is 

00:02:09.880 --> 00:02:14.170
 correctly installed to remove it 

00:02:11.950 --> 00:02:17.050
 simply use the nail presses 

00:02:14.170 --> 00:02:19.030
 listen to the click and take it out remember 

00:02:17.050 --> 00:02:21.400
 which is how to insert it is with the 

00:02:19.030 --> 00:02:22.810
 information here to this side and with 

00:02:21.400 --> 00:02:25.790
 water is remove that we see up here 

00:02:22.810 --> 00:02:28.410
 upwards 

00:02:25.790 --> 00:02:29.850
 correctly held and so the 

00:02:28.410 --> 00:02:32.310
 we enter 

00:02:29.850 --> 00:02:33.570
 and until the bottom until we hear 

00:02:32.310 --> 00:02:37.260
 click 

00:02:33.570 --> 00:02:39.270
 chapman click back to rent the 

00:02:37.260 --> 00:02:41.910
 microsd slot and put a lid 

00:02:39.270 --> 00:02:44.330
 again remember that if we do 

00:02:41.910 --> 00:02:47.830
 with the lid on 

00:02:44.330 --> 00:02:50.960
 suddenly with the use we can finish 

00:02:47.830 --> 00:02:53.720
 losing that capita since you have to 

00:02:50.960 --> 00:02:56.120
 raise it too much and with this you can 

00:02:53.720 --> 00:02:58.280
 damage goes to turn on the 

00:02:56.120 --> 00:03:01.660
 device 

00:02:58.280 --> 00:03:06.280
 we turn on the phone and wait 

00:03:01.660 --> 00:03:09.050
 we confirm that really the space 

00:03:06.280 --> 00:03:11.420
 correspond to the micro sd that are 

00:03:09.050 --> 00:03:12.950
 installing in this case of 7 2 gigas and 

00:03:11.420 --> 00:03:15.140
 let's verify that you have dóriga 

00:03:12.950 --> 00:03:17.660
 normally installed this memory of 2 

00:03:15.140 --> 00:03:20.660
 gigas has an available space of 

00:03:17.660 --> 00:03:23.760
 1.85 1.8 gijón 

00:03:20.660 --> 00:03:26.769
 gigas of usable space 

00:03:23.760 --> 00:03:28.989
 the phone and enter by 

00:03:26.769 --> 00:03:30.790
 configuration and storage as see 

00:03:28.989 --> 00:03:34.180
 really the available space 

00:03:30.790 --> 00:03:37.959
 usable for this micro sd and for the 

00:03:34.180 --> 00:03:40.450
 telephone phone expand up to 32 

00:03:37.959 --> 00:03:43.379
 64 but the default phone a box 

00:03:40.450 --> 00:03:43.379
 It comes with a 2 giga 

00:03:47.960 --> 00:03:54.060
 up a notification prepares 

00:03:50.460 --> 00:03:56.690
 card has apparently been all good 

00:03:54.060 --> 00:03:59.040
 we are here by configuration 

00:03:56.690 --> 00:04:00.990
 configuration we look for the option of 

00:03:59.040 --> 00:04:03.690
 storage 

00:04:00.990 --> 00:04:06.030
 and here as they were previously there was no 

00:04:03.690 --> 00:04:08.130
 information to carrion right now there is 

00:04:06.030 --> 00:04:10.460
 and he tells me effectively how he had 

00:04:08.130 --> 00:04:12.780
 done 1.85 reaches the total space 

00:04:10.460 --> 00:04:14.010
 It also gives me an option to withdraw the 

00:04:12.780 --> 00:04:17.730
 memory card at the time that 

00:04:14.010 --> 00:04:19.200
 I would like to withdraw is that everything for this 

00:04:17.730 --> 00:04:23.209
 moment I invite you to subscribe to the 

00:04:19.200 --> 00:04:23.209
 Channel 2
