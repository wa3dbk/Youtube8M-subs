00:03:06.030 --> 00:03:08.600 
double yeah so that's the big win right
there<00:03:06.260> and<00:03:07.260> then<00:03:07.500> I<00:03:07.769> believe<00:03:08.340> this<00:03:08.459> is<00:03:08.519> the

00:03:08.600 --> 00:03:08.610 
there and then I believe this is the

00:03:08.610 --> 00:03:10.280 
there and then I believe this is the
third<00:03:08.700> to<00:03:09.120> last<00:03:09.150> game<00:03:09.540> of<00:03:09.660> the<00:03:09.780> season

00:03:10.280 --> 00:03:10.290 
third to last game of the season

00:03:10.290 --> 00:03:11.900 
third to last game of the season
so<00:03:10.830> skills<00:03:11.130> needs<00:03:11.430> to<00:03:11.489> try<00:03:11.670> to<00:03:11.730> get<00:03:11.880> a

00:03:11.900 --> 00:03:11.910 
so skills needs to try to get a

00:03:11.910 --> 00:03:13.610 
so skills needs to try to get a
hat-trick<00:03:12.150> in<00:03:12.450> one<00:03:12.569> of<00:03:12.660> these<00:03:12.720> games<00:03:12.959> or<00:03:13.260> at

00:05:11.510 --> 00:05:11.520 
I'm not sure if that's because I was

00:05:11.520 --> 00:05:13.909 
I'm not sure if that's because I was
playing<00:05:12.090> center<00:05:12.690> forward<00:05:13.080> kind<00:05:13.590> of<00:05:13.680> like<00:05:13.830> the

00:05:13.909 --> 00:05:13.919

00:05:16.129 --> 00:05:16.139 
because here I'm playing right forward

00:05:16.139 --> 00:05:17.899 
because here I'm playing right forward
and<00:05:16.229> I<00:05:16.259> wonder<00:05:16.590> if<00:05:16.680> that<00:05:16.740> kind<00:05:17.039> of<00:05:17.159> messes<00:05:17.520> up<00:05:17.699> I

00:05:17.899 --> 00:05:17.909 
and I wonder if that kind of messes up I

00:05:17.909 --> 00:05:19.999 
and I wonder if that kind of messes up I
don't<00:05:18.270> even<00:05:18.360> know<00:05:18.569> if<00:05:18.599> I'll<00:05:18.870> get<00:05:19.110> the<00:05:19.349> I<00:05:19.740> don't
