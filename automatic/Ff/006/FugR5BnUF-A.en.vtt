00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.529
 Hello everyone, Alexander the Peace and 

00:00:02.070 --> 00:00:06.720
 channel review present to your attention 

00:00:04.529 --> 00:00:14.849
 this year's new gaming mouse 

00:00:06.720 --> 00:00:16.800
 steelseries riman mouse comes in 

00:00:14.849 --> 00:00:18.720
 small cardboard box door 

00:00:16.800 --> 00:00:20.939
 which opens and fastens on 

00:00:18.720 --> 00:00:22.650
 velcro in the open internal 

00:00:20.939 --> 00:00:24.720
 side door and all listed 

00:00:22.650 --> 00:00:26.820
 the main advantage of the device 

00:00:24.720 --> 00:00:29.930
 right side is the muscle itself now 

00:00:26.820 --> 00:00:29.930
 let's proceed to unpacking 

00:00:31.160 --> 00:00:35.850
 in my case the package was 

00:00:33.899 --> 00:00:38.370
 pretty simple inside the box lay 

00:00:35.850 --> 00:00:40.350
 just a mouse and a small piece of paper 

00:00:38.370 --> 00:00:41.610
 rai vol looks different from previous ones 

00:00:40.350 --> 00:00:43.559
 steel series models 

00:00:41.610 --> 00:00:46.200
 the first thing that catches your eye is not 

00:00:43.559 --> 00:00:48.899
 symmetrical mouse shape is clearly made under 

00:00:46.200 --> 00:00:51.149
 right hand if you are just you 

00:00:48.899 --> 00:00:53.309
 it will not be convenient to use it all 

00:00:51.149 --> 00:00:55.680
 The device has six buttons two 

00:00:53.309 --> 00:00:57.390

00:00:55.680 --> 00:00:58.920

00:00:57.390 --> 00:01:01.980

00:00:58.920 --> 00:01:04.199
 go former buttons under your thumb not 

00:01:01.980 --> 00:01:06.390
 separated by mouse backlit young 

00:01:04.199 --> 00:01:09.439
 the sky series logo is lit and 

00:01:06.390 --> 00:01:09.439
 scroll wheel 

00:01:09.770 --> 00:01:14.369
 backlight color can be customized by 

00:01:12.390 --> 00:01:16.490
 I will tell you about it 

00:01:14.369 --> 00:01:19.229
 separately 

00:01:16.490 --> 00:01:21.689
 armpit placed 4 shift glide 

00:01:19.229 --> 00:01:23.759
 made from teflon mouse heart 

00:01:21.689 --> 00:01:27.360
 serves as an improved optical sensor 

00:01:23.759 --> 00:01:30.630
 avago 1st 310 sensitivity given 

00:01:27.360 --> 00:01:33.060
 sensor may vary from 50 to six 

00:01:30.630 --> 00:01:34.920
 Whether at the same time and a half thousand for himself 

00:01:33.060 --> 00:01:36.630
 Developer Assurance Sensor 

00:01:34.920 --> 00:01:38.880
 provides no hardware 

00:01:36.630 --> 00:01:39.740
 acceleration and absolutely accurately determine 

00:01:38.880 --> 00:01:41.600
 your movement 

00:01:39.740 --> 00:01:44.030
 the mouse is fine i'm david in hand and 

00:01:41.600 --> 00:01:44.540
 there is a feeling that they did it under 

00:01:44.030 --> 00:01:46.100
 order 

00:01:44.540 --> 00:01:48.790
 the surface is made of pleasant 

00:01:46.100 --> 00:01:51.830
 cover to touch he's a little rough 

00:01:48.790 --> 00:01:54.170
 keys are pressed easily and damn they all 

00:01:51.830 --> 00:01:56.060
 located in convenient locations on the right and 

00:01:54.170 --> 00:01:58.789
 on the left various special rubber 

00:01:56.060 --> 00:02:00.259
 tabs with a corrugated coating I will not say 

00:01:58.789 --> 00:02:02.600
 that it helps better 

00:02:00.259 --> 00:02:04.820
 fix the device in your hand but to the touch 

00:02:02.600 --> 00:02:07.250
 very nice mouse you get used very much 

00:02:04.820 --> 00:02:10.899
 quickly and it seems that 

00:02:07.250 --> 00:02:10.899
 I 've been using it for a long time 

00:02:30.810 --> 00:02:37.069

00:02:48.470 --> 00:02:53.670
 in order to appreciate the whole 

00:02:51.300 --> 00:02:55.290

 device selection to configure it 

00:03:16.620 --> 00:03:20.940
 although it seemed rather strange to me 

00:03:18.210 --> 00:03:23.340
 that the mouse is designated as my photo technique 

00:03:20.940 --> 00:03:25.740
 click on the line with our mouse and get 

00:03:23.340 --> 00:03:27.600
 in the configuration menu softina 

00:03:25.740 --> 00:03:29.310
 has a comfortable and fairly clear 

00:03:27.600 --> 00:03:31.530
 the interface here can be customized 

00:03:29.310 --> 00:03:33.890
 different actions when pressing buttons 

00:03:31.530 --> 00:03:33.890
 mice 

00:03:34.550 --> 00:03:41.030
 example set any of the buttons on 

00:03:36.990 --> 00:03:41.030
 keyboard or write a macro 

00:03:51.989 --> 00:03:56.980
 using the software, you can change the backlight 

00:03:55.060 --> 00:04:01.390
 on the mouse setting any even color 

00:03:56.980 --> 00:04:03.430
 flashing or color sheep last 

00:04:01.390 --> 00:04:05.489
 case, the backlight color will be constantly 

00:04:03.430 --> 00:04:05.489

00:04:07.650 --> 00:04:12.430
 right column can be customized such 

00:04:10.329 --> 00:04:15.280
 parameters like acceleration sensitivity 

00:04:12.430 --> 00:04:18.209
 and slowing down the smoothing of corners and hours from 

00:04:15.280 --> 00:04:18.209
 questions yusbi 

00:04:22.410 --> 00:04:25.660
 plus mouse can explain the price 

00:04:24.880 --> 00:04:27.520
 availability 

00:04:25.660 --> 00:04:30.460
 as it is possible in online stores 

00:04:27.520 --> 00:04:31.870
 buy for 77 dollars i think that 

00:04:30.460 --> 00:04:37.780
 This is a small fee for such 

00:04:31.870 --> 00:04:40.330
 lack of quality sofa can 

00:04:37.780 --> 00:04:42.669
 carry a hefty carrot device on 

00:04:40.330 --> 00:04:46.979
 The mouse remains noticeable prints though 

00:04:42.669 --> 00:04:46.979
 it can be easily removed with a damp cloth 

00:04:55.759 --> 00:05:01.110
 In general, I gnawed him very much 

00:04:58.820 --> 00:05:03.360
 comfortable and nice in the hand 

00:05:01.110 --> 00:05:06.300
 has an extensive amount of features and 

00:05:03.360 --> 00:05:08.520
 low prices in this case for example 

00:05:06.300 --> 00:05:10.740
 good value for money on 

00:05:08.520 --> 00:05:11.520
 I have it all, I hope my review was 

00:05:10.740 --> 00:05:13.860
 useful to you 

00:05:11.520 --> 00:05:17.060
