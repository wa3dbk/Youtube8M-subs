00:02:03.420 --> 00:02:06.200 
him in the form of Stardust now I had
some<00:02:03.659> expectations<00:02:04.439> about<00:02:04.680> this<00:02:04.979> I<00:02:05.009> kind<00:02:05.969> of

00:02:06.200 --> 00:02:06.210 
some expectations about this I kind of

00:02:06.210 --> 00:02:07.819 
some expectations about this I kind of
thought<00:02:06.600> something<00:02:07.350> like<00:02:07.439> this<00:02:07.500> would<00:02:07.649> happen

00:02:07.819 --> 00:02:07.829 
thought something like this would happen

00:02:07.829 --> 00:02:10.070 
thought something like this would happen
it's<00:02:08.670> interesting<00:02:09.000> though<00:02:09.420> because<00:02:09.450> Stardust

00:02:10.070 --> 00:02:10.080 
it's interesting though because Stardust

00:02:10.080 --> 00:02:12.600 
it's interesting though because Stardust
is<00:02:10.470> of<00:02:10.649> course<00:02:10.860> Cody<00:02:11.760> Rhodes

custom<00:02:23.080> outfit<00:02:23.730> custom<00:02:24.730> move<00:02:24.940> said<00:02:25.210> he<00:02:25.360> has

00:02:25.440 --> 00:02:25.450 
custom outfit custom move said he has

00:02:25.450 --> 00:02:26.970 
custom outfit custom move said he has
like<00:02:25.630> a<00:02:25.660> diamond<00:02:26.050> dust<00:02:26.440> so<00:02:26.740> it's<00:02:26.860> like<00:02:26.950> a

00:02:26.970 --> 00:02:26.980 
like a diamond dust so it's like a

00:02:26.980 --> 00:02:30.090 
like a diamond dust so it's like a
corner<00:02:27.850> a<00:02:28.000> flip<00:02:28.720> cutter<00:02:29.020> move<00:02:29.260> which<00:02:29.830> looks

00:02:30.090 --> 00:02:30.100 
corner a flip cutter move which looks

00:02:30.100 --> 00:02:32.100 
corner a flip cutter move which looks
pretty<00:02:30.190> cool<00:02:30.610> so<00:02:31.240> it's<00:02:31.270> interesting<00:02:31.570> because

00:02:32.100 --> 00:02:32.110 
pretty cool so it's interesting because

00:02:32.110 --> 00:02:34.770 
pretty cool so it's interesting because
they<00:02:32.500> invested<00:02:33.040> a<00:02:33.190> lot<00:02:33.610> of<00:02:33.640> time<00:02:33.790> into<00:02:34.300> this<00:02:34.450> so

00:02:34.770 --> 00:02:34.780 
they invested a lot of time into this so

00:02:34.780 --> 00:02:37.050 
they invested a lot of time into this so
what<00:02:34.960> I'm<00:02:35.110> thinking<00:02:35.140> is<00:02:35.830> that<00:02:35.920> this<00:02:36.670> is<00:02:36.880> not

00:02:37.050 --> 00:02:37.060 
what I'm thinking is that this is not

00:02:37.060 --> 00:02:38.910 
what I'm thinking is that this is not
like<00:02:37.240> a<00:02:37.300> one-time<00:02:37.900> appearance<00:02:38.410> thing<00:02:38.680> but

00:02:38.910 --> 00:02:38.920 
like a one-time appearance thing but

00:02:38.920 --> 00:02:40.590 
like a one-time appearance thing but
they're<00:02:39.040> going<00:02:39.280> to<00:02:39.370> try<00:02:39.640> to<00:02:39.670> make<00:02:39.940> this<00:02:40.150> like<00:02:40.420> a

00:02:40.590 --> 00:02:40.600 
they're going to try to make this like a

00:02:40.600 --> 00:02:42.780 
they're going to try to make this like a
thing<00:02:40.930> so<00:02:41.470> this<00:02:41.680> is<00:02:41.830> officially<00:02:41.980> attacked

00:02:42.780 --> 00:02:42.790 
thing so this is officially attacked

00:02:42.790 --> 00:02:45.420 
thing so this is officially attacked
team<00:02:43.060> so<00:02:43.330> I<00:02:43.540> would<00:02:43.990> like<00:02:44.140> to<00:02:44.170> know<00:02:44.440> what<00:02:45.160> what

these extravagant characters one way or
another<00:03:12.670> and<00:03:13.060> Cody<00:03:13.660> wasn't<00:03:13.989> really<00:03:14.410> all<00:03:14.440> like

00:03:14.790 --> 00:03:14.800
