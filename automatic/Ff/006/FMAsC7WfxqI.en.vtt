step<00:02:54.459> number<00:02:54.670> two<00:02:55.060> we<00:02:55.450> hold<00:02:55.810> the<00:02:56.079> rubber<00:02:56.260> ball

00:02:56.580 --> 00:02:56.590 
step number two we hold the rubber ball

step number two we hold the rubber ball
firmly<00:02:57.070> by<00:02:57.459> the<00:02:57.519> valve<00:02:57.880> and<00:02:58.209> insert<00:02:58.930> the

00:02:59.130 --> 00:02:59.140 
firmly by the valve and insert the

firmly by the valve and insert the
nozzle<00:02:59.640> completely<00:03:02.670> so<00:03:03.670> this<00:03:04.209> has<00:03:04.480> to<00:03:04.660> go<00:03:04.780> all

00:03:05.099 --> 00:03:05.109 
nozzle completely so this has to go all

00:03:05.109 --> 00:03:35.630 
nozzle completely so this has to go all
the<00:03:05.739> way<00:03:05.769> in

00:03:35.630 --> 00:03:35.640 

00:03:35.640 --> 00:03:37.970 

fold<00:03:36.480> it<00:03:36.690> up<00:03:36.810> in<00:03:36.960> front<00:03:37.110> of<00:03:37.260> your<00:03:37.410> face<00:03:37.650> let's

00:03:42.240 --> 00:03:42.250 

00:03:42.250 --> 00:03:46.860 

oh<00:03:43.800> no<00:03:44.800> we<00:03:45.100> can't<00:03:45.370> see<00:03:45.580> you<00:03:45.820> maybe<00:03:46.390> we<00:03:46.600> didn't

maybe<00:03:52.690> we<00:03:52.930> should<00:03:53.110> fill<00:03:53.320> it<00:03:53.440> up<00:03:53.530> some<00:03:53.800> more<00:04:19.590> so

00:04:20.580 --> 00:04:20.590 
maybe we should fill it up some more so

00:04:20.590 --> 00:04:23.120 
maybe we should fill it up some more so
I<00:04:20.620> put<00:04:21.040> a<00:04:21.070> piece<00:04:21.340> of<00:04:21.670> duct<00:04:21.910> tape<00:04:21.940> here<00:04:22.600> because

00:04:23.120 --> 00:04:23.130 
I put a piece of duct tape here because

00:04:23.130 --> 00:04:26.100 
I put a piece of duct tape here because
we<00:04:24.130> got<00:04:24.640> it<00:04:24.790> out<00:04:24.940> of<00:04:25.030> the<00:04:25.090> box<00:04:25.270> and<00:04:25.630> play<00:04:25.900> with

00:04:26.100 --> 00:04:26.110 
we got it out of the box and play with

00:04:26.110 --> 00:04:26.460 
we got it out of the box and play with
it

00:04:26.460 --> 00:04:26.470 
it

00:04:26.470 --> 00:04:30.510 
it
and<00:04:27.600> discovered<00:04:28.600> a<00:04:28.840> hole<00:04:29.290> in<00:04:29.590> it<00:04:29.920> I<00:04:30.130> don't

00:04:30.510 --> 00:04:30.520 
and discovered a hole in it I don't

00:04:30.520 --> 00:04:33.600 
and discovered a hole in it I don't
think<00:04:30.850> it<00:04:31.060> was<00:04:31.350> playing<00:04:32.350> with<00:04:32.560> it<00:04:32.620> this<00:04:33.310> side

00:04:33.600 --> 00:04:33.610 
think it was playing with it this side

00:04:33.610 --> 00:04:36.450 
think it was playing with it this side
field<00:04:34.210> filled<00:04:34.570> up<00:04:34.810> faster<00:04:35.320> then<00:04:36.040> this<00:04:36.220> other

00:04:36.450 --> 00:04:36.460 
field filled up faster then this other

00:04:36.460 --> 00:04:37.080 
field filled up faster then this other
side

00:04:37.080 --> 00:04:37.090 
side

00:04:37.090 --> 00:04:39.270 
side
so<00:04:37.600> this<00:04:37.780> part<00:04:37.990> is<00:04:38.080> actually<00:04:38.260> thicker<00:04:38.830> and

00:04:39.270 --> 00:04:39.280 
so this part is actually thicker and

00:04:39.280 --> 00:04:43.470 
so this part is actually thicker and
this<00:04:40.120> side<00:04:40.450> was<00:04:41.169> all<00:04:41.500> thin<00:04:41.980> so<00:04:42.940> I<00:04:42.970> think<00:04:43.180> our

00:04:43.470 --> 00:04:43.480 
this side was all thin so I think our

00:04:43.480 --> 00:04:48.540 
this side was all thin so I think our
balls<00:04:43.990> was<00:04:44.760> manufactured<00:04:45.960> wrong<00:04:46.960> so<00:04:47.650> let<00:04:48.370> me

00:04:48.540 --> 00:04:48.550 
balls was manufactured wrong so let me

00:04:48.550 --> 00:04:50.159 
balls was manufactured wrong so let me
know<00:04:48.730> in<00:04:48.880> the<00:04:48.910> comments<00:04:49.450> if<00:04:49.600> you<00:04:49.660> have<00:04:50.140> a

00:05:48.219 --> 00:05:52.350 
well that was our review of the wubble
ball<00:05:48.629> overall<00:05:49.629> parents<00:05:50.319> I<00:05:50.469> think<00:05:51.060> $20<00:05:52.060> is<00:05:52.330> a

00:05:52.350 --> 00:05:52.360 
ball overall parents I think $20 is a

00:05:52.360 --> 00:05:56.010 
ball overall parents I think $20 is a
little<00:05:52.749> too<00:05:52.960> much<00:05:53.430> we<00:05:54.430> honestly<00:05:55.300> had<00:05:55.659> a<00:05:55.689> hole

00:05:56.010 --> 00:05:56.020 
little too much we honestly had a hole

00:05:56.020 --> 00:05:59.399 
little too much we honestly had a hole
within<00:05:56.529> the<00:05:56.650> first<00:05:56.889> hour<00:05:57.219> and<00:05:58.110> since<00:05:59.110> I<00:05:59.229> had

00:05:59.399 --> 00:05:59.409 
within the first hour and since I had

00:05:59.409 --> 00:06:02.760 
within the first hour and since I had
nothing<00:05:59.979> to<00:06:00.189> lose<00:06:00.419> it<00:06:01.419> was<00:06:01.629> a<00:06:01.659> tiny<00:06:02.020> hole<00:06:02.349> so<00:06:02.710> I

00:06:02.760 --> 00:06:02.770 
nothing to lose it was a tiny hole so I

00:06:02.770 --> 00:06:05.309 
nothing to lose it was a tiny hole so I
just<00:06:03.069> put<00:06:03.310> a<00:06:03.340> dab<00:06:03.819> of<00:06:03.849> superglue<00:06:04.599> on<00:06:04.810> it<00:06:05.139> and

00:06:05.309 --> 00:06:05.319 
just put a dab of superglue on it and

00:06:05.319 --> 00:06:08.909 
just put a dab of superglue on it and
let<00:06:05.560> it<00:06:05.680> dry<00:06:05.979> and<00:06:06.520> we<00:06:07.270> see<00:06:07.659> inflata<00:06:08.229> dit<00:06:08.499> and<00:06:08.650> it

00:06:08.909 --> 00:06:08.919 
let it dry and we see inflata dit and it

00:06:08.919 --> 00:06:13.290 
let it dry and we see inflata dit and it
works<00:06:09.129> just<00:06:09.669> fine<00:06:10.050> there<00:06:11.050> is<00:06:11.620> a<00:06:12.520> rubber<00:06:12.909> ball

00:06:13.290 --> 00:06:13.300 
works just fine there is a rubber ball

00:06:13.300 --> 00:06:16.499 
works just fine there is a rubber ball
lifetime<00:06:14.110> replacement<00:06:14.529> warranty<00:06:15.120> but<00:06:16.120> it

00:06:16.499 --> 00:06:16.509 
lifetime replacement warranty but it

00:06:16.509 --> 00:06:18.990 
lifetime replacement warranty but it
cost<00:06:16.990> seven<00:06:17.409> dollars<00:06:17.800> just<00:06:18.189> to<00:06:18.430> send<00:06:18.699> it<00:06:18.849> in

00:06:18.990 --> 00:06:19.000 
cost seven dollars just to send it in

00:06:19.000 --> 00:06:23.909 
cost seven dollars just to send it in
and<00:06:19.560> from<00:06:20.560> online<00:06:21.719> forums<00:06:22.719> I<00:06:22.960> am<00:06:23.169> not<00:06:23.379> sure<00:06:23.650> how

00:06:23.909 --> 00:06:23.919 
and from online forums I am not sure how

00:06:23.919 --> 00:06:25.830 
and from online forums I am not sure how
long<00:06:23.979> it<00:06:24.370> takes<00:06:24.610> to<00:06:24.789> get<00:06:24.909> your<00:06:25.060> replacement<00:06:25.330> I

00:06:25.830 --> 00:06:25.840 
long it takes to get your replacement I

00:06:25.840 --> 00:06:28.170 
long it takes to get your replacement I
think<00:06:26.229> it's<00:06:26.409> a<00:06:26.500> long<00:06:26.710> time<00:06:27.069> the<00:06:27.699> rubber<00:06:27.909> ball

00:06:28.170 --> 00:06:28.180 
think it's a long time the rubber ball

00:06:28.180 --> 00:06:31.409 
think it's a long time the rubber ball
is<00:06:28.479> pretty<00:06:28.779> cool<00:06:29.139> but<00:06:29.889> don't<00:06:30.189> expect<00:06:30.490> a<00:06:31.120> lot<00:06:31.389> of

00:06:31.409 --> 00:06:31.419 
is pretty cool but don't expect a lot of

00:06:31.419 --> 00:06:35.790 
is pretty cool but don't expect a lot of
playtime<00:06:31.960> out<00:06:32.229> of<00:06:32.379> it<00:06:32.529> because<00:06:34.469> ours<00:06:35.469> is

00:06:35.790 --> 00:06:35.800 
playtime out of it because ours is

00:06:35.800 --> 00:06:37.769 
playtime out of it because ours is
already<00:06:36.009> looking<00:06:36.340> like<00:06:36.580> it<00:06:36.849> has<00:06:37.029> been<00:06:37.060> spots

00:06:37.769 --> 00:06:37.779 
already looking like it has been spots

00:06:37.779 --> 00:06:40.230 
already looking like it has been spots
where<00:06:38.409> it's<00:06:38.740> getting<00:06:39.159> worn<00:06:39.490> down<00:06:39.580> and<00:06:39.759> we<00:06:40.029> just
