00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.810
 that of this sport itself knows that it has 

00:00:01.949 --> 00:00:05.850
 often grazed death he delivered his 

00:00:03.810 --> 00:00:07.859
 testimony while ayton senna was 

00:00:05.850 --> 00:00:09.929
 still fighting death 

00:00:07.859 --> 00:00:12.780
 at the hospital in Bologna we listen to his 

00:00:09.929 --> 00:00:13.820
 testimony I wonder if we can 

00:00:12.780 --> 00:00:16.010
 to make a 

00:00:13.820 --> 00:00:18.560
 a real record of a day like as 

00:00:16.010 --> 00:00:21.640
 this one because 

00:00:18.560 --> 00:00:24.990
 in reality it's a weekend absolutely 

00:00:21.640 --> 00:00:24.990
 incredible that we just attended 

00:00:25.060 --> 00:00:30.080
 3 an accident them 

00:00:27.050 --> 00:00:33.050
 very serious with consequences for 

00:00:30.080 --> 00:00:34.090
 the moment of little diverse 

00:00:33.050 --> 00:00:36.010
 gold 

00:00:34.090 --> 00:00:38.620
 a pilot who is surviving a bit 

00:00:36.010 --> 00:00:41.140
 miraculously another who struggling 

00:00:38.620 --> 00:00:43.210
 for now against against death to 

00:00:41.140 --> 00:00:46.420
 against very serious sequels 

00:00:43.210 --> 00:00:48.160
 three accidents with 3 mechanical break 

00:00:46.420 --> 00:00:51.129
 apparently we can import here a 

00:00:48.160 --> 00:00:52.930
 puncture a suspension a lot of 

00:00:51.129 --> 00:00:54.489
 question that we can ask ourselves and we 

00:00:52.930 --> 00:00:55.750
 pose anyway on cars 

00:00:54.489 --> 00:00:57.910
 we have been asking ourselves since 

00:00:55.750 --> 00:00:59.590
 long a questioning 

00:00:57.910 --> 00:01:02.430
 an awareness absolutely 

00:00:59.590 --> 00:01:04.170
 indispensable for the future 

00:01:02.430 --> 00:01:05.550
 regarding the regulations 

00:01:04.170 --> 00:01:07.890
 techniques anyway some 

00:01:05.550 --> 00:01:09.600
 will say that anyway these 

00:01:07.890 --> 00:01:10.920
 incidents are inherent in the 

00:01:09.600 --> 00:01:12.270
 competition as is breakages 

00:01:10.920 --> 00:01:13.710
 mechanical it can happen even with 

00:01:12.270 --> 00:01:16.320
 any type of car 

00:01:13.710 --> 00:01:18.210
 but what these cases under these problems 

00:01:16.320 --> 00:01:20.400
 are not due precisely to a succession 

00:01:18.210 --> 00:01:22.450
 improvement based on 

00:01:20.400 --> 00:01:23.710
 regulations that changes without stopping 

00:01:22.450 --> 00:01:25.329
 the pit stops the 

00:01:23.710 --> 00:01:28.360
 refueling we knew it was 

00:01:25.329 --> 00:01:29.920
 hard and one day have to say it's because 

00:01:28.360 --> 00:01:32.530
 that the minimum that may have occurred 

00:01:29.920 --> 00:01:34.509
 gold today we do not dare to imagine this 

00:01:32.530 --> 00:01:36.369
 that it can be monaco in fifteen 

00:01:34.509 --> 00:01:37.929
 days so it will definitely have to revisit 

00:01:36.369 --> 00:01:42.399
 a lot of things that's the balance sheet 

00:01:37.929 --> 00:01:43.569
 so we can also say that formula 1 

00:01:42.399 --> 00:01:45.700
 will always remain 

00:01:43.569 --> 00:01:47.380
 dangerous and that when we roll at 300 to 

00:01:45.700 --> 00:01:48.939
 time like here in this circuit 

00:01:47.380 --> 00:01:51.429
 imola hardly we have a problem 

00:01:48.939 --> 00:01:54.009
 especially technical we are of course 

00:01:51.429 --> 00:01:55.210
 inclined to see degraded consequences 

00:01:54.009 --> 00:01:56.470
 but 

00:01:55.210 --> 00:01:58.420
 we can not always always 

00:01:56.470 --> 00:02:00.369
 accepted and there the chance of activity was 

00:01:58.420 --> 00:02:01.600
 separate the fatality is not true 

00:02:00.369 --> 00:02:03.280
 have been doing a lot of work for a very long time 

00:02:01.600 --> 00:02:04.960
 of security that people do not speak 

00:02:03.280 --> 00:02:07.150
 security has been around for a very long time 

00:02:04.960 --> 00:02:08.860
 the business side takes precedence over the 

00:02:07.150 --> 00:02:10.030
 sport before there was power 

00:02:08.860 --> 00:02:12.430
 sporting and economic power 

00:02:10.030 --> 00:02:13.750
 now they are gathered together and we have it 

00:02:12.430 --> 00:02:16.060
 seen again today this is the proof 

00:02:13.750 --> 00:02:17.620
 that one thing that counts is this and of 

00:02:16.060 --> 00:02:18.819
 2,2 to start again is to 

00:02:17.620 --> 00:02:20.530
 continue the race not to stop it 

00:02:18.819 --> 00:02:22.090
 in the end when there were two or 

00:02:20.530 --> 00:02:22.890
 three people who lay in the 

00:02:22.090 --> 00:02:24.459
 stands 

00:02:22.890 --> 00:02:27.160
 personally I find it outrageous 

00:02:24.459 --> 00:02:29.019
 if it's like that if it does not change I 

00:02:27.160 --> 00:02:31.470
 have already left but I am and I have 

00:02:29.019 --> 00:02:33.730
 still a foot for to try to 

00:02:31.470 --> 00:02:35.230
 personally to give the maximum 

00:02:33.730 --> 00:02:36.900
 information because I'm still 

00:02:35.230 --> 00:02:38.470
 passionate about the automobile but 

00:02:36.900 --> 00:02:40.600
 today he fascinates me a lot 

00:02:38.470 --> 00:02:42.850
 less hot it's true alain small and 

00:02:40.600 --> 00:02:44.260
 can do this examination of conscience at 

00:02:42.850 --> 00:02:45.610
 world the formula 1 and how can anyone 

00:02:44.260 --> 00:02:46.900
 make 

00:02:45.610 --> 00:02:48.930
 I believe that there is the real take of 

00:02:46.900 --> 00:02:50.700
 consciousness 

00:02:48.930 --> 00:02:52.620
 I have almost 10 before the before 

00:02:50.700 --> 00:02:53.939
 start of the race unfortunately she 

00:02:52.620 --> 00:02:56.219
 is to be done by everyone 

00:02:53.939 --> 00:02:58.260
 it can be sponsor builder team 

00:02:56.219 --> 00:03:00.840
 manager especially of course federation 

00:02:58.260 --> 00:03:03.299
 these are the first concerned and even 

00:03:00.840 --> 00:03:05.459
 the pilots because today after 

00:03:03.299 --> 00:03:07.739
 the senna accident I think the 

00:03:05.459 --> 00:03:09.840
 pilots could have even tried 

00:03:07.739 --> 00:03:11.430
 to mount something and it's true 

00:03:09.840 --> 00:03:12.840
 that she 150000 people that's true 

00:03:11.430 --> 00:03:14.760
 what we have in italy is that 

00:03:12.840 --> 00:03:17.430
 is a lot but is 

00:03:14.760 --> 00:03:19.170
 day we will not put the sport back in 

00:03:17.430 --> 00:03:20.459
 evidence compared to 

00:03:19.170 --> 00:03:22.200
 business interests 

00:03:20.459 --> 00:03:23.430
 you've been rivals forever 

00:03:22.200 --> 00:03:25.470
 of a level all the time yet at 

00:03:23.430 --> 00:03:27.109
 senate and cloud is now on a bed 

00:03:25.470 --> 00:03:29.459
 of hospital you have a thought for him 

00:03:27.109 --> 00:03:32.250
 you know it's not easy for me 

00:03:29.459 --> 00:03:34.530
 because it was even more same rivals 

00:03:32.250 --> 00:03:37.459
 that rivals a certain moment but everything 

00:03:34.530 --> 00:03:37.459
 was well over 

00:03:37.980 --> 00:03:40.920
 today he had sent me a message 

00:03:39.540 --> 00:03:44.060
 really they were who was very 

00:03:40.920 --> 00:03:44.060
 Very kind 

00:03:50.650 --> 00:03:55.269
 jeckyll and shook hands before the start 

00:03:52.540 --> 00:03:57.370
 of the race ie its rivals or 

00:03:55.269 --> 00:03:58.450
 paris go i can tell you that it's 

00:03:57.370 --> 00:04:00.330
 still someone who owed the same 

00:03:58.450 --> 00:04:02.490
 job than me 

00:04:00.330 --> 00:04:04.260
 and who lived completely 100% to 

00:04:02.490 --> 00:04:06.570
 his passion if not 110% then me 

00:04:04.260 --> 00:04:09.030
 I can tell you that I lived only 95 

00:04:06.570 --> 00:04:10.350
 98 % it has nothing to do with this 

00:04:09.030 --> 00:04:12.440
 that he did he is she able to 

00:04:10.350 --> 00:04:14.760
 take all the risks to succeed and 

00:04:12.440 --> 00:04:15.990
 today I just hope I want 

00:04:14.760 --> 00:04:17.820
 to say that they drive more a formula 

00:04:15.990 --> 00:04:19.489
 1 be serious but he may walk again 

00:04:17.820 --> 00:04:21.840
 live normally 

00:04:19.489 --> 00:04:24.210
 So that's 20 minutes after this 

00:04:21.840 --> 00:04:27.770
 interview we learned about ayrton's death 

00:04:24.210 --> 00:04:27.770
 senna in brazil
