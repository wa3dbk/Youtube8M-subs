 you lack the necessary change to high 

00:00:09.150 --> 00:00:13.019

 or do you have a brilliant movie idea? 

00:00:13.019 --> 00:00:16.500
 but not the financial one 

00:00:14.849 --> 00:00:19.020
 to implement this 

00:00:16.500 --> 00:00:20.340
 how about space dinosaurs 

00:00:19.020 --> 00:00:21.930
 with a ship on the way to 

00:00:20.340 --> 00:00:25.140

00:00:32.009 --> 00:00:37.769
 Marcel receives her account balance

 see yourself as we are rich 

00:00:37.769 --> 00:00:39.690
 developed particularly high for me 

00:00:39.120 --> 00:00:41.760
 claims 

00:00:39.690 --> 00:00:43.649
 Of course it was not enough for us 

00:00:41.760 --> 00:00:45.649
 to develop into the standard product 

00:00:43.649 --> 00:00:47.760
 we wanted to revolutionize the whole thing 

00:00:45.649 --> 00:00:50.850
 processed the whole in this branch 

00:00:47.760 --> 00:00:53.429
 area in beautiful austria for 

00:00:50.850 --> 00:00:55.829
 Our customers only the best is good 

00:00:53.429 --> 00:00:57.539
 enough rich can be after the 

00:00:55.829 --> 00:00:58.350
 Application lasting in your everyday life 

00:00:57.539 --> 00:01:00.839
 use 

00:00:58.350 --> 00:01:04.140
 They pay everything without thinking 

00:01:00.839 --> 00:01:06.600
 They do not care if bills are great 

00:01:04.140 --> 00:01:08.340
 apple products or use her 

00:01:06.600 --> 00:01:12.229
 Money in a completely new way 

00:01:08.340 --> 00:01:12.229
 for example for firing 

00:01:12.240 --> 00:01:18.630
 as a toilet paper substitute or as 

00:01:15.910 --> 00:01:20.550
 Placeholder in the bookshelf 

00:01:18.630 --> 00:01:22.690
 Of course, being rich is special 

00:01:20.550 --> 00:01:26.860
 rich in important vitamins like 

00:01:22.690 --> 00:01:28.300
 for example, vitamin e and d became rich 

00:01:26.860 --> 00:01:30.010
 of course on a pure plant basis 

00:01:28.300 --> 00:01:32.710
 which we are particularly proud of 

00:01:30.010 --> 00:01:34.510
 are underpaid workers working 16 

00:01:32.710 --> 00:01:36.820
 hours a day on our plantations in 

00:01:34.510 --> 00:01:38.200
 the whole thing is imported france 

00:01:36.820 --> 00:01:40.120
 then in loose branch area in 

00:01:38.200 --> 00:01:42.460
 Austria as already mentioned 

00:01:40.120 --> 00:01:44.890
 stacked there cleaned and then comes 

00:01:42.460 --> 00:01:47.080
 directly on your account thousands of people 

00:01:44.890 --> 00:01:48.250
 worldwide are already convinced how to 

00:01:47.080 --> 00:01:51.310
 for example, the son of the apple founder 

00:01:48.250 --> 00:01:52.840
 Steve Jobs actually knows that he does not 

00:01:51.310 --> 00:01:54.130
 but I really believe her 

00:01:52.840 --> 00:01:57.160
 that even apple sometime small 

00:01:54.130 --> 00:01:59.229
 never started us immediately 

00:01:57.160 --> 00:02:00.970
 area I think so a 

00:01:59.229 --> 00:02:02.560
 Developing a product already costs 

00:02:00.970 --> 00:02:04.119
 a lot of share capital 

00:02:02.560 --> 00:02:05.979
 that's why we've gotten rich too 

00:02:04.119 --> 00:02:08.200
 and thus could the expensive researches 

00:02:05.979 --> 00:02:10.300
 also pay or look easy 

00:02:08.200 --> 00:02:12.790
 as another example, barack obama 

00:02:10.300 --> 00:02:15.040
 Barack Obama is rich and therefore called 

00:02:12.790 --> 00:02:17.110
 that rich people too us presidents 

00:02:15.040 --> 00:02:19.600
 can become another reason rich 

00:02:17.110 --> 00:02:21.959
 They also buy themselves right to buy 

00:02:19.600 --> 00:02:25.630
 home, whether normal rich 

00:02:21.959 --> 00:02:26.980
 stinkreich or kingdom they call 

00:02:25.630 --> 00:02:28.840
 just pay and pay in 

00:02:26.980 --> 00:02:29.290
 after all, if you do not care anymore 

00:02:28.840 --> 00:02:30.970
 to have 

00:02:29.290 --> 00:02:32.530
 you do not know at which number 

00:02:30.970 --> 00:02:35.140
 I guess if I them to 

00:02:32.530 --> 00:02:37.209
 the saying is enough or not 

00:02:35.140 --> 00:02:39.070
 so that was great with the third one 

00:02:37.209 --> 00:02:40.720
 Product advertising now i would like 

00:02:39.070 --> 00:02:42.340
