00:00:05.690 --> 00:00:10.620
 hello friends with you day with semenihin and 

00:00:08.580 --> 00:00:13.110
 we continue to discuss and in detail 

00:00:10.620 --> 00:00:15.480
 parse all the nutrition issues today 

00:00:13.110 --> 00:00:17.310
 we will actually be chemical 

00:00:15.480 --> 00:00:20.189
 experiment because speech today 

00:00:17.310 --> 00:00:22.050
 go about curd about this absolutely I would 

00:00:20.189 --> 00:00:23.910
 said the cornerstone of product testing 

00:00:22.050 --> 00:00:25.710
 any person leading a healthy way 

00:00:23.910 --> 00:00:27.990
 living and taking muscle 

00:00:25.710 --> 00:00:30.300
 so this cottage cheese we will not just 

00:00:27.990 --> 00:00:32.850
 we will disassemble the purchased cottage cheese 

00:00:30.300 --> 00:00:34.440
 today try to cook first 

00:00:32.850 --> 00:00:36.680
 This is an extremely convenient product for me 

00:00:34.440 --> 00:00:39.149
 the car always has at least the minimum 

00:00:36.680 --> 00:00:40.860
 reserve amount of cottage cheese is always and 

00:00:39.149 --> 00:00:42.660
 there is always something that can be water curd 

00:00:40.860 --> 00:00:44.190
 add with this on this table now 

00:00:42.660 --> 00:00:47.129
 we see dried apricots and 

00:00:44.190 --> 00:00:48.809
 confiture confiture concentration 40 

00:00:47.129 --> 00:00:51.570
 percent it means that in this 

00:00:48.809 --> 00:00:53.370
 computer 40 percent simple 

00:00:51.570 --> 00:00:56.370
 carbohydrate per 100 grams 40 grams 

00:00:53.370 --> 00:00:58.160
 fructose and dried apricots concentration 60 

00:00:56.370 --> 00:01:01.170
 percent that is per 100 grams of dried apricots 

00:00:58.160 --> 00:01:02.820
 60 grams of simple carbs is very 

00:01:01.170 --> 00:01:05.129
 a lot so here are these things we sash 

00:01:02.820 --> 00:01:07.229
 I will add literally the minimum I mean 

00:01:05.129 --> 00:01:12.600
 for taste the most important ingredient is 

00:01:07.229 --> 00:01:15.479
 hipper 1 liter with a fat content of 0.1 percent 

00:01:12.600 --> 00:01:18.540
 eat no fat now protein 2 and 8 

00:01:15.479 --> 00:01:19.080
 grams per 100 grams means 28 grams 

00:01:18.540 --> 00:01:21.119
 per liter 

00:01:19.080 --> 00:01:23.840
 here are all the source materials friends I 

00:01:21.119 --> 00:01:26.640
 I suggest we start cooking 

00:01:23.840 --> 00:01:29.520
 chemical physical experiment because 

00:01:26.640 --> 00:01:33.650
 that this is not chemistry this is physics and so is liter 

00:01:29.520 --> 00:01:36.350
 kefir I pour into a special container 

00:01:33.650 --> 00:01:37.360
 kefir poured induction heating high 

00:01:36.350 --> 00:01:40.460
 pressure 

00:01:37.360 --> 00:01:46.060
 close not all you need now is 

00:01:40.460 --> 00:01:46.060
 find the right button to click on start 

00:01:47.200 --> 00:02:04.730
 no no quenching oven cottage cheese nothing 

00:01:54.320 --> 00:02:06.710
 start everything is well that the product is ready I did not even 

00:02:04.730 --> 00:02:09.610
 imagine that we still see there so 

00:02:06.710 --> 00:02:12.440
 clearly means it will have to merge 

00:02:09.610 --> 00:02:14.780
 Trend watch yogurt separated such 

00:02:12.440 --> 00:02:16.970
 yellowish lead from a kefir liter 

00:02:14.780 --> 00:02:19.250
 we got about 170 grams 

00:02:16.970 --> 00:02:21.740
 dry matter vorog 

00:02:19.250 --> 00:02:23.900
 the rest is all separated fluid in these 

00:02:21.740 --> 00:02:26.930
 170 grams counts only in cottage cheese 

00:02:23.900 --> 00:02:29.150
 protein concentrations vary but 

00:02:26.930 --> 00:02:31.490
 average can be said to 17 18 

00:02:29.150 --> 00:02:33.470
 percent that is , we have here almost 30 

00:02:31.490 --> 00:02:35.690
 grams of protein and this is milk protein 

00:02:33.470 --> 00:02:37.370
 as you understand it is the second 

00:02:35.690 --> 00:02:39.110
 amino acid and a set of 

00:02:37.370 --> 00:02:41.030
 digestibility by the human body 

00:02:39.110 --> 00:02:42.050
 protein after egg that is it is very 

00:02:41.030 --> 00:02:43.400
 high-quality protein 

00:02:42.050 --> 00:02:46.100
 that is, you understand a kilo of cottage cheese 

00:02:43.400 --> 00:02:48.280
 It is 170 grams of protein per pound of cottage cheese 

00:02:46.100 --> 00:02:52.860
 or about 90 grams of another standing on 

00:02:48.280 --> 00:02:55.290
 major product recommend to you 

00:02:52.860 --> 00:02:58.550
 this is a normal product this is normal he 

00:02:55.290 --> 00:03:01.230
 still warm slightly it can be eaten even 

00:02:58.550 --> 00:03:04.740
 if a little bit of simple carbohydrates here 

00:03:01.230 --> 00:03:07.020
 add by the way here it is i feel that 

00:03:04.740 --> 00:03:09.120
 low fat is not the gate which 

00:03:07.020 --> 00:03:12.030
 even in expensive supermarkets you buy 

00:03:09.120 --> 00:03:14.010
 who 0 from his plate you can there everything 

00:03:12.030 --> 00:03:15.240
 Men remain I recommend you cottage cheese 

00:03:14.010 --> 00:03:16.530
 especially cottage cheese low-fat 

00:03:15.240 --> 00:03:18.690
 but naturally if you have 

00:03:16.530 --> 00:03:20.520
 a unique opportunity to cook yourself 

00:03:18.690 --> 00:03:22.590
 the curd turns out really 

00:03:20.520 --> 00:03:24.300
 useful product seriously i will say in 

00:03:22.590 --> 00:03:26.130
 the store did not eat such cottage cheese that is 

00:03:24.300 --> 00:03:28.500
 so fat free that's it 

00:03:26.130 --> 00:03:31.200
 feeling i don't feel from the enemy which 

00:03:28.500 --> 00:03:32.820
 even sold as 0 so that the curd was 

00:03:31.200 --> 00:03:34.650
 tastier naturally we add there 

00:03:32.820 --> 00:03:36.750
 either dried apricots or something like that can 

00:03:34.650 --> 00:03:38.010
 honey add but guys at a minimum because 

00:03:36.750 --> 00:03:40.800
 what we remember is simple carbohydrates 

00:03:38.010 --> 00:03:42.660
 here for example dried apricots, too, 150 grams 

00:03:40.800 --> 00:03:43.410
 dried apricots how look what such 150 

00:03:42.660 --> 00:03:45.200
 grams of dried apricots 

00:03:43.410 --> 00:03:47.760
 there you have 100 grams of simple carbohydrates 

00:03:45.200 --> 00:03:49.770
 if you look at 150 grams of dried apricots 

00:03:47.760 --> 00:03:51.650
 this is not this at all this is miserable what kind 

00:03:49.770 --> 00:03:53.970
 you can eat just on the machine so 

00:03:51.650 --> 00:03:54.300
 more attentively to these all sorts of 

00:03:53.970 --> 00:03:57.060
 things 

00:03:54.300 --> 00:03:59.150
 which you add to the curd and so 

00:03:57.060 --> 00:04:01.769
 I can tell you eat right 

00:03:59.150 --> 00:04:04.970
 train hard not look further 

00:04:01.769 --> 00:04:04.970
 my releases bye
