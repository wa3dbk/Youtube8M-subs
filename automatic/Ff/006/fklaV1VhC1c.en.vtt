problem straightaway when I when I look
up<00:00:29.130> when<00:00:29.550> I<00:00:29.580> look<00:00:29.820> at<00:00:29.939> something<00:00:30.119> the<00:00:30.269> blocks

00:00:35.200 --> 00:00:35.210 

00:00:35.210 --> 00:00:39.220 

look<00:00:35.930> this<00:00:36.530> is<00:00:36.680> all<00:00:36.890> happened<00:00:38.079> this<00:00:39.079> is

00:00:39.220 --> 00:00:39.230 
look this is all happened this is

00:00:39.230 --> 00:00:41.590 
look this is all happened this is
because<00:00:39.590> it's<00:00:39.890> an<00:00:39.949> HD<00:00:40.370> texture<00:00:41.000> pack<00:00:41.239> and<00:00:41.480> it

00:00:41.590 --> 00:00:41.600 
because it's an HD texture pack and it

00:00:41.600 --> 00:00:44.259 
because it's an HD texture pack and it
has<00:00:41.750> not<00:00:41.899> been<00:00:41.960> patched<00:00:42.469> and<00:00:42.770> if<00:00:43.699> you<00:00:44.120> look

00:00:44.259 --> 00:00:44.269 
has not been patched and if you look

00:00:44.269 --> 00:00:47.770 
has not been patched and if you look
over<00:00:44.449> here<00:00:44.809> so<00:00:45.530> the<00:00:45.890> rocks<00:00:46.460> are<00:00:46.760> okay<00:00:47.149> but<00:00:47.540> as

00:00:47.770 --> 00:00:47.780 
over here so the rocks are okay but as

00:00:47.780 --> 00:00:50.170 
over here so the rocks are okay but as
you<00:00:48.019> get<00:00:48.199> different<00:00:48.949> block<00:00:49.370> like<00:00:49.640> paintings

00:00:50.170 --> 00:00:50.180 
you get different block like paintings

00:00:50.180 --> 00:00:52.630 
you get different block like paintings
and<00:00:50.480> stuff<00:00:50.750> I<00:00:51.100> might<00:00:52.100> demonstrate<00:00:52.250> with

00:00:52.630 --> 00:00:52.640 
and stuff I might demonstrate with

00:00:52.640 --> 00:00:59.380 
and stuff I might demonstrate with
painting<00:00:53.089> quickly<00:00:53.449> choose<00:00:54.170> some<00:00:56.050> Tweaker

00:00:59.380 --> 00:00:59.390 

00:00:59.390 --> 00:01:01.510 

sometimes<00:01:00.260> the<00:01:00.410> paintings<00:01:00.860> don't<00:01:01.130> work<00:01:01.340> it

00:01:01.510 --> 00:01:01.520
