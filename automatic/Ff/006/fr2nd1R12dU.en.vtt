sort of job defensively he can get

00:03:09.270 --> 00:03:10.850 
sort of job defensively he can get
caught<00:03:09.570> out<00:03:09.660> a<00:03:09.720> couple<00:03:09.960> times<00:03:10.110> but<00:03:10.470> you<00:03:10.710> got<00:03:10.830> to

00:03:10.850 --> 00:03:10.860 
caught out a couple times but you got to

00:03:10.860 --> 00:03:12.620 
caught out a couple times but you got to
find<00:03:11.130> it<00:03:11.250> in<00:03:11.430> the<00:03:11.610> defensive<00:03:12.000> line<00:03:12.060> and<00:03:12.330> that's

00:03:12.620 --> 00:03:12.630 
find it in the defensive line and that's

00:03:12.630 --> 00:03:14.000 
find it in the defensive line and that's
what<00:03:12.840> the<00:03:12.930> Panthers<00:03:13.260> couldn't<00:03:13.530> do<00:03:13.590> last<00:03:13.740> week

00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:14.010

00:03:14.010 --> 00:03:16.240 
what the Panthers couldn't do last week
I<00:03:14.490> think<00:03:14.940> the<00:03:15.180> dogs<00:03:15.360> can<00:03:15.660> do<00:03:15.810> it<00:03:15.900> this<00:03:15.990> week

00:03:16.240 --> 00:03:16.250 
I think the dogs can do it this week

00:03:16.250 --> 00:03:19.460 
I think the dogs can do it this week
they<00:03:17.250> were<00:03:17.330> clinical<00:03:18.330> against<00:03:18.960> the<00:03:19.080> Titans

00:03:19.460 --> 00:03:19.470 
they were clinical against the Titans

00:03:19.470 --> 00:03:23.570 
they were clinical against the Titans
without<00:03:20.100> being<00:03:20.430> you<00:03:21.090> know<00:03:21.620> superb<00:03:22.620> and<00:03:22.920> this

without being you know superb and this

00:03:23.580 --> 00:03:25.280 
without being you know superb and this

week<00:04:40.120> in<00:04:40.240> defeat<00:04:40.509> yeah<00:04:41.050> I<00:04:41.080> think<00:04:41.409> they<00:04:41.710> were

00:04:41.760 --> 00:04:41.770 
week in defeat yeah I think they were

00:04:41.770 --> 00:04:43.679 
week in defeat yeah I think they were
you<00:04:42.129> know<00:04:42.250> all<00:04:42.460> things<00:04:42.669> considered<00:04:43.180> who

00:04:43.679 --> 00:04:43.689 
you know all things considered who

00:04:43.689 --> 00:04:45.480 
you know all things considered who
they'd<00:04:43.900> lost<00:04:44.110> and<00:04:44.379> Carmichael<00:04:44.770> hunt<00:04:45.069> out<00:04:45.250> you

00:04:45.480 --> 00:04:45.490 
they'd lost and Carmichael hunt out you

they'd lost and Carmichael hunt out you
know<00:04:45.610> sort<00:04:45.879> of<00:04:45.939> at<00:04:46.419> the<00:04:46.479> last<00:04:46.840> minute<00:04:47.080> so<00:04:47.169> to

00:05:27.689 --> 00:05:27.699 
the years speaking of the eels it is

00:05:27.699 --> 00:05:30.029 
the years speaking of the eels it is
third<00:05:28.120> verse<00:05:28.360> second<00:05:28.810> deals<00:05:29.139> versus<00:05:29.800> the

00:05:30.029 --> 00:05:30.039 
third verse second deals versus the

00:05:30.039 --> 00:05:31.980 
third verse second deals versus the
seagulls<00:05:30.639> at<00:05:30.849> parramatta<00:05:31.509> stay<00:05:31.750> and<00:05:31.870> this

00:05:31.980 --> 00:05:31.990 
seagulls at parramatta stay and this

00:05:31.990 --> 00:05:33.689 
seagulls at parramatta stay and this
will<00:05:32.199> be<00:05:32.289> a<00:05:32.319> cracker<00:05:32.620> I<00:05:32.919> think<00:05:33.340> this<00:05:33.430> will<00:05:33.550> be

00:05:33.689 --> 00:05:33.699 
will be a cracker I think this will be

00:05:33.699 --> 00:05:35.279 
will be a cracker I think this will be
one<00:05:33.849> of<00:05:33.940> the<00:05:34.000> biggest<00:05:34.150> tests<00:05:34.779> that<00:05:34.960> the<00:05:35.110> eels

00:05:35.279 --> 00:05:35.289 
one of the biggest tests that the eels

00:05:35.289 --> 00:05:37.589 
one of the biggest tests that the eels
have<00:05:35.440> been<00:05:35.590> put<00:05:35.800> under<00:05:35.889> for<00:05:36.039> a<00:05:36.310> while<00:05:36.580> you<00:05:37.509> know

they weren't necessarily tested

00:05:39.009 --> 00:05:41.279 
they weren't necessarily tested
enormously<00:05:39.340> by<00:05:39.490> the<00:05:39.550> Broncos<00:05:39.940> last<00:05:40.180> week<00:05:40.449> and

00:05:41.289 --> 00:05:42.950 
enormously by the Broncos last week and
I<00:05:41.379> think<00:05:41.500> it's<00:05:41.589> a<00:05:41.620> wee<00:05:41.740> big<00:05:41.919> test<00:05:42.159> and<00:05:42.279> I<00:05:42.310> think

00:05:42.950 --> 00:05:42.960 
I think it's a wee big test and I think

00:05:42.960 --> 00:05:46.649 
I think it's a wee big test and I think
manly<00:05:43.960> will<00:05:44.379> come<00:05:44.650> home<00:05:44.919> on<00:05:45.370> topping<00:05:46.300> this<00:05:46.449> one

00:05:48.600 --> 00:05:48.610 
I'm gonna go the deals I think they

00:05:48.610 --> 00:05:49.769 
I'm gonna go the deals I think they
showed<00:05:48.789> enough<00:05:49.060> in<00:05:49.180> that<00:05:49.210> game<00:05:49.599> I<00:05:49.750> think

00:05:49.769 --> 00:05:49.779 
showed enough in that game I think

00:05:49.779 --> 00:05:51.269 
showed enough in that game I think
they've<00:05:50.110> got<00:05:50.289> they've<00:05:50.560> got<00:05:50.589> players<00:05:50.949> there

00:05:51.269 --> 00:05:51.279 
they've got they've got players there

00:05:51.279 --> 00:05:53.820 
they've got they've got players there
who<00:05:52.120> know<00:05:52.330> can<00:05:52.810> read<00:05:52.990> the<00:05:53.139> game<00:05:53.289> take<00:05:53.560> a<00:05:53.589> dive

00:05:53.820 --> 00:05:53.830

00:05:53.830 --> 00:05:56.550 
who know can read the game take a dive
when<00:05:54.039> they<00:05:54.190> need<00:05:54.930> joking<00:05:55.930> I'm<00:05:56.080> not<00:05:56.229> saying

00:05:56.550 --> 00:05:56.560 
when they need joking I'm not saying

00:05:56.560 --> 00:05:58.769 
when they need joking I'm not saying
that<00:05:56.860> but<00:05:57.550> look<00:05:58.029> I<00:05:58.120> think<00:05:58.330> they<00:05:58.419> also<00:05:58.539> got<00:05:58.719> a

00:05:58.769 --> 00:05:58.779 
that but look I think they also got a

00:05:58.779 --> 00:06:01.589 
that but look I think they also got a
the<00:05:59.409> attacking<00:05:59.740> force<00:06:00.250> to<00:06:00.759> go<00:06:01.120> through<00:06:01.419> the

00:06:01.589 --> 00:06:01.599 
the attacking force to go through the

00:06:01.599 --> 00:06:03.390 
the attacking force to go through the
Eagles<00:06:02.080> and<00:06:02.199> I<00:06:02.589> don't<00:06:02.770> think<00:06:02.919> the<00:06:03.009> Eagles<00:06:03.099> can

00:06:03.390 --> 00:06:03.400 
Eagles and I don't think the Eagles can

00:06:03.400 --> 00:06:04.680 
Eagles and I don't think the Eagles can
score<00:06:03.639> the<00:06:03.729> points<00:06:03.879> again<00:06:04.150> seal<00:06:04.330> so<00:06:04.479> I'm<00:06:04.569> going

00:06:04.680 --> 00:06:04.690 
score the points again seal so I'm going

00:06:04.690 --> 00:06:06.029 
score the points again seal so I'm going
