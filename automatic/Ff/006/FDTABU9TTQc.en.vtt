00:00:01.420 --> 00:00:05.860
 here we are and we were clear good 

00:00:04.120 --> 00:00:07.720
 children, you asked for it and you 

00:00:05.860 --> 00:00:10.630
 I promised mainly to the band 

00:00:07.720 --> 00:00:12.670
 cementera that last night we talked about 

00:00:10.630 --> 00:00:15.130
 of the subject of titto there are some means 

00:00:12.670 --> 00:00:17.259
 angry but but tito good first you 

00:00:15.130 --> 00:00:19.570
 I salute that this is a treat to be here 

00:00:17.259 --> 00:00:21.400
 with you people are like mad but 

00:00:19.570 --> 00:00:23.440
 of sorrow of sadness that I do not leave 

00:00:21.400 --> 00:00:26.199
 'tito' because I'm going to the cement 

00:00:23.440 --> 00:00:29.500
 they are so you tell them little channels not in 

00:00:26.199 --> 00:00:31.930
 principle the truth that I of some 

00:00:29.500 --> 00:00:34.749
 way I felt all the affection all the 

00:00:31.930 --> 00:00:36.760
 support via twitter was following everything 

00:00:34.749 --> 00:00:38.940
 this is me you said it to me 

00:00:36.760 --> 00:00:41.039
 immigration to arrive too 

00:00:38.940 --> 00:00:42.570
 and I was in Argentina I tell you the day well 

00:00:41.039 --> 00:00:46.079
 As I commented a little while ago on the day 

00:00:42.570 --> 00:00:48.570
 announce that things were not received 

00:00:46.079 --> 00:00:51.180
 in half an hour like 20,000 20,000 

00:00:48.570 --> 00:00:54.300
 mentions somehow not from 

00:00:51.180 --> 00:00:57.690
 sadness of anguish because I could not 

00:00:54.300 --> 00:01:00.120
 stay but well he said it just 

00:00:57.690 --> 00:01:01.799
 I do not think we all did all we put 

00:01:00.120 --> 00:01:03.479
 the best of us so that things 

00:01:01.799 --> 00:01:06.240
 come to a good port 

00:01:03.479 --> 00:01:09.539
 many times for different opinions or 

00:01:06.240 --> 00:01:12.240
 for different projects as things 

00:01:09.539 --> 00:01:13.409
 they have to change and it 's a shame 

00:01:12.240 --> 00:01:16.470
 because I have identified myself 

00:01:13.409 --> 00:01:18.690
 always with them have always made me 

00:01:16.470 --> 00:01:20.909
 feel great and I 'm going to 

00:01:18.690 --> 00:01:22.289
 always thank and I said it 

00:01:20.909 --> 00:01:24.119
 via twitter also in my heart 

00:01:22.289 --> 00:01:26.940
 they will always be because the change of 

00:01:24.119 --> 00:01:28.659
 team because wherever I go that never 

00:01:26.940 --> 00:01:30.609
 will vary what 

00:01:28.659 --> 00:01:33.579
 what I feel for the people's club 

00:01:30.609 --> 00:01:36.280
 tito totally agree because I give 

00:01:33.579 --> 00:01:37.780
 faith I saw you and I said it throughout the 

00:01:36.280 --> 00:01:40.240
 tournament that I was very close to you 

00:01:37.780 --> 00:01:43.780
 this time the villa tito is a man who 

00:01:40.240 --> 00:01:45.490
 leaves 150% on the court for his team 

00:01:43.780 --> 00:01:48.099
 for his colors because he is a professional 

00:01:45.490 --> 00:01:49.750
 but you also have to understand that 

00:01:48.099 --> 00:01:52.329
 more that I'm in love with a 

00:01:49.750 --> 00:01:54.459
 institution if suddenly there are interests 

00:01:52.329 --> 00:01:55.990
 different that it's worth then it's time 

00:01:54.459 --> 00:01:58.299
 to move on the story is a 

00:01:55.990 --> 00:01:59.170
 professional and we are all and well 

00:01:58.299 --> 00:02:02.500
 it is this 

00:01:59.170 --> 00:02:05.020
 yes because even the fact of being able 

00:02:02.500 --> 00:02:06.670
 continue in Mexico also because I 

00:02:05.020 --> 00:02:08.829
 I wanted that blue cross 

00:02:06.670 --> 00:02:10.869
 when I saw that things did not 

00:02:08.829 --> 00:02:12.610
 they were still in a good port because I wanted them 

00:02:10.869 --> 00:02:15.129
 blue cross also received something because 

00:02:12.610 --> 00:02:17.200
 They have always given me everything and then I 

00:02:15.129 --> 00:02:20.079
 I could have gone anywhere and 

00:02:17.200 --> 00:02:22.049
 without blue cross will participate in anything and 

00:02:20.079 --> 00:02:25.000
 the opposite then at least I'm 

00:02:22.049 --> 00:02:27.459
 I'm leaving good accounts as soon as 

00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:28.709
 in terms of numbers and others because then 

00:02:27.459 --> 00:02:31.940
 they will receive a remuneration 

00:02:28.709 --> 00:02:34.010
 important as far as me 

00:02:31.940 --> 00:02:35.900
 and that's not about being grateful 

00:02:34.010 --> 00:02:39.410
 I would never blame anyone will 

00:02:35.900 --> 00:02:41.210
 because I understand and I think that they 

00:02:39.410 --> 00:02:44.860
 They also put the best of zinc laro 

00:02:41.210 --> 00:02:47.840
 but this is football because we all have 

00:02:44.860 --> 00:02:50.660
 a life ahead and surely they 

00:02:47.840 --> 00:02:53.210
 in his projects maybe he was interested or 

00:02:50.660 --> 00:02:55.040
 they saw something else that I did not see and it was because 

00:02:53.210 --> 00:02:58.070
 that each one decided to take his path 

00:02:55.040 --> 00:02:59.960
 but that does not take away all the love and 

00:02:58.070 --> 00:03:02.120
 mutual affection that we have with the 

00:02:59.960 --> 00:03:05.120
 people and with everyone here believe me 

00:03:02.120 --> 00:03:06.890
 believe me my dear little ticket that you 

00:03:05.120 --> 00:03:09.830
 I understand more than you believe in this 

00:03:06.890 --> 00:03:12.320
 moment has wanted friend hey last you 

00:03:09.830 --> 00:03:14.780
 you found out that there were young followers 

00:03:12.320 --> 00:03:17.420
 of blue cross who wanted to come here to the 

00:03:14.780 --> 00:03:19.820
 consular house to manifest your support to you 

00:03:17.420 --> 00:03:22.850
 to ask you not to go to all this 

00:03:19.820 --> 00:03:24.980
 you found out then I got it to see in 

00:03:22.850 --> 00:03:27.170
 some tweet that you have sent me and 

00:03:24.980 --> 00:03:29.510
 they are things that 

00:03:27.170 --> 00:03:31.310
 if one understands them then to me in what 

00:03:29.510 --> 00:03:33.739
 I would be sorry if people come to 

00:03:31.310 --> 00:03:36.830
 claim for me because the truth that 

00:03:33.739 --> 00:03:38.180
 I 've never been able to never be this neither 

00:03:36.830 --> 00:03:40.940
 I always say it but we have 

00:03:38.180 --> 00:03:42.500
 could give you a title and so all the 

00:03:40.940 --> 00:03:45.590
 people manifested themselves spectacularly 

00:03:42.500 --> 00:03:48.530
 always with me then it gave me 

00:03:45.590 --> 00:03:51.530
 like a little bit of pity that happened but 

00:03:48.530 --> 00:03:53.569
 good that means that as they said 

00:03:51.530 --> 00:03:57.140
 that happened around me was not not in vain 

00:03:53.569 --> 00:03:58.880
 that I always answered the best 

00:03:57.140 --> 00:04:02.030
 way that I could football and 

00:03:58.880 --> 00:04:05.240
 humanely and I think it's a lot is a lot 

00:04:02.030 --> 00:04:08.150
 the value that is what people are 

00:04:05.240 --> 00:04:08.870
 really receives and perceives of me not me 

00:04:08.150 --> 00:04:11.390

00:04:08.870 --> 00:04:13.880
 I leave you with the blue cross people are 

00:04:11.390 --> 00:04:15.410
