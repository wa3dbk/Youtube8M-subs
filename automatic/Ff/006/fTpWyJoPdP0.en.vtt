like a VGA port plug in thing um but

00:02:11.250 --> 00:02:15.650 
like a VGA port plug in thing um but
etheline<00:02:11.880> because<00:02:12.150> as<00:02:12.269> the<00:02:12.480> controls<00:02:14.450> so<00:02:15.450> I'm

00:02:15.650 --> 00:02:15.660 
etheline because as the controls so I'm

00:02:15.660 --> 00:02:17.920 
etheline because as the controls so I'm
going<00:02:15.930> to<00:02:15.989> go<00:02:16.049> ahead<00:02:16.140> and<00:02:16.319> show<00:02:16.440> you<00:02:16.500> the<00:02:16.680> sub

00:02:17.920 --> 00:02:17.930 
going to go ahead and show you the sub

00:02:17.930 --> 00:02:22.430 
going to go ahead and show you the sub
so<00:02:18.930> here<00:02:19.260> it<00:02:19.349> is<00:02:19.440> pretty<00:02:20.099> big<00:02:20.400> about<00:02:21.440> six

00:02:22.430 --> 00:02:22.440
