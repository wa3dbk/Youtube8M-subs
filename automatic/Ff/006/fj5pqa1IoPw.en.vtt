00:02:51.440 --> 00:02:51.450 
finally signal processing unit gets put

00:02:51.450 --> 00:02:56.720 
finally signal processing unit gets put
around<00:02:51.629> our<00:02:51.840> neck<00:02:54.650> our<00:02:55.650> probe<00:02:56.040> gets<00:02:56.370> plugged

into the back of that signal processing
units

00:03:05.290 --> 00:03:05.300 

00:03:05.300 --> 00:03:09.300 

so<00:03:06.170> then<00:03:06.500> gets<00:03:06.710> attached<00:03:07.070> to<00:03:07.250> a<00:03:07.430> vacuum<00:03:07.790> full<00:03:08.240> I

00:03:09.300 --> 00:03:09.310 
so then gets attached to a vacuum full I

00:03:09.310 --> 00:03:12.490 
so then gets attached to a vacuum full I
like<00:03:10.310> to<00:03:10.580> pull<00:03:11.270> the<00:03:11.450> cable<00:03:11.660> up<00:03:11.960> the<00:03:12.110> length<00:03:12.320> of

00:03:12.490 --> 00:03:12.500 
like to pull the cable up the length of

00:03:12.500 --> 00:03:15.550 
like to pull the cable up the length of
the<00:03:12.590> pole<00:03:12.830> and<00:03:13.100> I'm<00:03:13.670> often<00:03:13.880> going<00:03:14.270> to<00:03:14.360> tape<00:03:14.840> the

00:03:15.550 --> 00:03:15.560 
the pole and I'm often going to tape the

00:03:15.560 --> 00:03:17.170 
the pole and I'm often going to tape the
cable<00:03:15.920> to<00:03:16.010> the<00:03:16.100> pole<00:03:16.310> so<00:03:16.550> it's<00:03:16.700> out<00:03:16.820> of<00:03:16.850> our<00:03:17.060> way

00:03:17.170 --> 00:03:17.180 
cable to the pole so it's out of our way

00:03:17.180 --> 00:03:18.030 
cable to the pole so it's out of our way
as<00:03:17.360> we<00:03:17.510> use<00:03:17.660> it

00:03:18.030 --> 00:03:18.040 
as we use it

00:03:18.040 --> 00:03:21.310 
as we use it
finally<00:03:19.120> profe<00:03:20.120> goes<00:03:20.360> in<00:03:20.540> the<00:03:20.630> water<00:03:20.780> I'm

00:03:21.310 --> 00:03:21.320 
finally profe goes in the water I'm

00:03:21.320 --> 00:03:25.720 
finally profe goes in the water I'm
going<00:03:21.470> to<00:03:21.560> shake<00:03:21.800> the<00:03:21.980> bubbles<00:03:22.340> out<00:03:24.610> turn<00:03:25.610> the

00:03:25.720 --> 00:03:25.730 
going to shake the bubbles out turn the

00:03:25.730 --> 00:03:31.940 
going to shake the bubbles out turn the
unit<00:03:25.910> on<00:03:26.030> we're<00:03:26.270> ready<00:03:26.390> to<00:03:26.540> go

00:03:31.940 --> 00:03:31.950 

00:03:31.950 --> 00:03:34.050 

so<00:03:32.950> what<00:03:33.099> we're<00:03:33.250> doing<00:03:33.280> with<00:03:33.490> the<00:03:33.670> leap<00:03:33.819> Trek

00:03:34.050 --> 00:03:34.060 
so what we're doing with the leap Trek

00:03:34.060 --> 00:03:36.000 
so what we're doing with the leap Trek
is<00:03:34.270> we're<00:03:34.480> putting<00:03:34.630> a<00:03:34.780> real<00:03:34.989> small<00:03:35.440> electrical

00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:36.010 
is we're putting a real small electrical

00:03:36.010 --> 00:03:38.460 
is we're putting a real small electrical
charge<00:03:36.069> into<00:03:36.790> the<00:03:36.880> pool<00:03:37.060> water<00:03:37.330> and<00:03:37.660> then

00:03:38.460 --> 00:03:38.470 
charge into the pool water and then

00:03:38.470 --> 00:03:40.710 
charge into the pool water and then
we're<00:03:38.620> making<00:03:38.739> a<00:03:39.010> ground<00:03:39.340> connection<00:03:39.730> outside

00:03:40.710 --> 00:03:40.720 
we're making a ground connection outside

00:03:40.720 --> 00:03:43.500 
we're making a ground connection outside
the<00:03:40.930> pool<00:03:41.340> all<00:03:42.340> of<00:03:42.610> that<00:03:42.730> electricity<00:03:43.180> going

00:03:43.500 --> 00:03:43.510 
the pool all of that electricity going

00:03:43.510 --> 00:03:45.449 
the pool all of that electricity going
into<00:03:43.720> the<00:03:43.810> pool<00:03:44.020> is<00:03:44.319> trying<00:03:44.620> to<00:03:44.709> get<00:03:44.830> back<00:03:44.890> to

00:03:45.449 --> 00:03:45.459 
into the pool is trying to get back to

00:03:45.459 --> 00:03:47.190 
into the pool is trying to get back to
ground<00:03:45.760> in<00:03:46.030> order<00:03:46.150> to<00:03:46.330> complete<00:03:46.660> its<00:03:46.810> circuit

00:03:47.190 --> 00:03:47.200 
ground in order to complete its circuit

00:03:47.200 --> 00:03:49.770 
ground in order to complete its circuit
in<00:03:48.010> a<00:03:48.100> vinyl<00:03:48.310> liner<00:03:48.580> swimming<00:03:49.090> pool<00:03:49.360> because

00:03:49.770 --> 00:03:49.780 
in a vinyl liner swimming pool because

00:03:49.780 --> 00:03:51.960 
in a vinyl liner swimming pool because
the<00:03:49.930> liner<00:03:50.170> is<00:03:50.319> a<00:03:50.380> good<00:03:50.530> insulator<00:03:50.830> the<00:03:51.489> only

00:03:51.960 --> 00:03:51.970 
the liner is a good insulator the only

00:03:51.970 --> 00:03:53.910 
the liner is a good insulator the only
path<00:03:52.239> to<00:03:52.270> ground<00:03:52.690> is<00:03:53.050> through<00:03:53.290> a<00:03:53.319> conductive

00:03:53.910 --> 00:03:53.920 
path to ground is through a conductive

00:03:53.920 --> 00:03:55.710 
path to ground is through a conductive
hole<00:03:54.160> or<00:03:54.459> penetration<00:03:55.120> and<00:03:55.209> a<00:03:55.270> liner

00:03:55.710 --> 00:03:55.720 
hole or penetration and a liner

00:03:55.720 --> 00:03:58.650 
hole or penetration and a liner
thus<00:03:55.989> a<00:03:56.230> leak<00:03:56.880> the<00:03:57.880> way<00:03:58.000> we're<00:03:58.180> using<00:03:58.330> the<00:03:58.510> leak

00:03:58.650 --> 00:03:58.660 
thus a leak the way we're using the leak

00:03:58.660 --> 00:04:00.449 
thus a leak the way we're using the leak
track<00:03:58.959> is<00:03:59.170> that<00:03:59.349> electricity<00:03:59.950> that's<00:04:00.280> being

now<00:04:32.110> we'll<00:04:32.350> sweep<00:04:32.650> the<00:04:32.889> pool<00:04:33.450> the<00:04:34.450> closer<00:04:34.780> we

00:04:35.040 --> 00:04:35.050 
now we'll sweep the pool the closer we

00:04:35.050 --> 00:04:36.870 
now we'll sweep the pool the closer we
get<00:04:35.169> to<00:04:35.229> that<00:04:35.320> leak<00:04:35.680> the<00:04:36.130> more<00:04:36.340> rapid<00:04:36.729> that

we're getting a real strong reading at
the<00:05:28.680> light<00:05:28.890> because<00:05:29.490> of<00:05:29.610> the<00:05:29.700> metal<00:05:29.910> niche

00:05:30.310 --> 00:05:30.320 
the light because of the metal niche

00:05:30.320 --> 00:05:32.750 
the light because of the metal niche
that's<00:05:31.320> a<00:05:31.440> strong<00:05:31.740> connection<00:05:32.070> to<00:05:32.280> ground<00:05:32.550> and

that's a strong connection to ground and
is<00:05:32.820> giving<00:05:33.150> us<00:05:33.240> a<00:05:33.360> strong<00:05:33.630> leak<00:05:33.900> track<00:05:34.170> reading

00:05:34.690 --> 00:05:34.700 
is giving us a strong leak track reading

00:05:34.700 --> 00:05:38.240 
is giving us a strong leak track reading
in<00:05:35.700> order<00:05:35.970> to<00:05:36.150> make<00:05:36.810> leaks<00:05:37.140> easier<00:05:37.680> to<00:05:37.860> find<00:05:38.100> in

in order to make leaks easier to find in

00:05:38.250 --> 00:05:40.490 
in order to make leaks easier to find in
the<00:05:38.340> swimming<00:05:38.550> pool<00:05:38.700> it's<00:05:39.420> helpful<00:05:39.810> if<00:05:40.140> we<00:05:40.290> can

00:05:40.490 --> 00:05:40.500 
the swimming pool it's helpful if we can

00:05:40.500 --> 00:05:43.430 
the swimming pool it's helpful if we can
cover<00:05:40.800> or<00:05:41.130> eliminate<00:05:41.790> any<00:05:42.060> of<00:05:42.540> those<00:05:42.690> non<00:05:43.020> leak

00:05:43.430 --> 00:05:43.440 
cover or eliminate any of those non leak

00:05:43.440 --> 00:05:46.610 
cover or eliminate any of those non leak
connections<00:05:44.010> to<00:05:44.160> ground<00:05:44.400> that<00:05:44.580> we<00:05:44.700> can<00:05:45.620> okay

00:05:46.610 --> 00:05:46.620 
connections to ground that we can okay

00:05:46.620 --> 00:05:48.350 
connections to ground that we can okay
so<00:05:46.680> the<00:05:46.980> light<00:05:47.190> cover<00:05:47.460> is<00:05:47.670> going<00:05:47.880> to<00:05:47.940> be<00:05:48.090> used

00:05:48.350 --> 00:05:48.360 
so the light cover is going to be used

00:05:48.360 --> 00:05:50.270 
so the light cover is going to be used
to<00:05:48.540> cover<00:05:48.930> these<00:05:49.230> underwater<00:05:49.650> coal<00:05:50.010> lights

behind<00:06:20.610> the<00:06:21.480> light<00:06:21.690> cover<00:06:21.990> so<00:06:22.470> we're

00:06:22.610 --> 00:06:22.620 
behind the light cover so we're

00:06:22.620 --> 00:06:24.620 
behind the light cover so we're
basically<00:06:22.770> lowering<00:06:23.670> the<00:06:23.790> water<00:06:24.000> level

00:06:24.620 --> 00:06:24.630

00:06:31.130 --> 00:06:31.140 
here these hoses are going to have to

00:06:31.140 --> 00:06:33.440 
here these hoses are going to have to

stay on the pool deck we're going to

00:06:33.450 --> 00:06:35.120 
stay on the pool deck we're going to
capture<00:06:33.660> a<00:06:33.870> little<00:06:34.050> bit<00:06:34.320> of<00:06:34.440> air<00:06:34.770> in<00:06:34.950> this

00:06:45.830 --> 00:06:45.840 

00:06:45.840 --> 00:06:49.770 

that'll<00:06:46.840> keep<00:06:46.990> it<00:06:47.169> in<00:06:47.289> place<00:06:48.180> then<00:06:49.180> we<00:06:49.360> use<00:06:49.569> the

00:06:49.770 --> 00:06:49.780 
that'll keep it in place then we use the

00:06:49.780 --> 00:06:54.600 
that'll keep it in place then we use the

see the water level actually go down and
we<00:07:02.409> know<00:07:02.590> then<00:07:02.889> that<00:07:03.460> there's<00:07:03.669> enough

00:07:03.959 --> 00:07:03.969 
we know then that there's enough

00:07:03.969 --> 00:07:06.510 
we know then that there's enough

may<00:07:16.840> occasionally<00:07:17.500> give<00:07:17.710> you<00:07:17.919> a<00:07:18.129> leak<00:07:18.460> track

00:07:18.749 --> 00:07:18.759 
may occasionally give you a leak track

may occasionally give you a leak track
reading<00:07:19.180> even<00:07:19.539> though<00:07:19.659> they're<00:07:19.870> not<00:07:19.900> leaking

00:07:20.319 --> 00:07:23.010 
reading even though they're not leaking
the<00:07:21.069> reason<00:07:21.460> is<00:07:21.669> that<00:07:21.879> the<00:07:22.330> screws<00:07:22.689> that

00:07:23.010 --> 00:07:23.020 
the reason is that the screws that

00:07:23.020 --> 00:07:24.689 
the reason is that the screws that
penetrate<00:07:23.529> through<00:07:23.860> these<00:07:24.069> fittings<00:07:24.520> are

00:07:24.689 --> 00:07:24.699 
penetrate through these fittings are

00:07:24.699 --> 00:07:26.580 
penetrate through these fittings are
making<00:07:25.029> connection<00:07:25.479> to<00:07:25.599> ground<00:07:25.719> and<00:07:26.259> thus

00:07:26.580 --> 00:07:26.590 
making connection to ground and thus

00:07:26.590 --> 00:07:28.469 
making connection to ground and thus
there's<00:07:26.889> a<00:07:26.949> half<00:07:27.430> that<00:07:27.669> the<00:07:27.789> leak<00:07:27.969> track<00:07:28.270> will

00:07:28.469 --> 00:07:28.479 
there's a half that the leak track will

00:07:28.479 --> 00:07:30.899 
there's a half that the leak track will
pick<00:07:28.659> up<00:07:28.840> the<00:07:29.620> best<00:07:29.860> way<00:07:30.069> to<00:07:30.099> eliminate<00:07:30.460> these
