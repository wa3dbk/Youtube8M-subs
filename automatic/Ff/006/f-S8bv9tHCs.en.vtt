00:00:00.440 --> 00:00:06.310
 hello friends, well, here we are with 

00:00:02.510 --> 00:00:08.660
 a grab as not from android I living 

00:00:06.310 --> 00:00:10.669
 you are the new operating system of 

00:00:08.660 --> 00:00:12.379
 google the latest version of android that 

00:00:10.669 --> 00:00:15.079
 we have available for this terminal 

00:00:12.379 --> 00:00:18.710
 well here we have a rom that is 

00:00:15.079 --> 00:00:20.180
 we could really say that what 

00:00:18.710 --> 00:00:22.820
 there are now living in is 

00:00:20.180 --> 00:00:26.890
 the lightest and fastest is based on the 

00:00:22.820 --> 00:00:30.440
 official rom with the official software of the 

00:00:26.890 --> 00:00:32.689
 galaxy nexus then all the let's say the 

00:00:30.440 --> 00:00:33.550
 appearance is the same as that of the galaxy 

00:00:32.689 --> 00:00:36.320
 nexus 

00:00:33.550 --> 00:00:38.269
 Well, we could say that the boot 

00:00:36.320 --> 00:00:39.980
 animation is to say the animation that comes out 

00:00:38.269 --> 00:00:42.289
 when we start the terminal is the 

00:00:39.980 --> 00:00:45.050
 original of the nexus is an X with that 

00:00:42.289 --> 00:00:47.629
 the four colors of google 

00:00:45.050 --> 00:00:49.760
 tell you that everything works that work 

00:00:47.629 --> 00:00:51.800
 all the components correctly and 

00:00:49.760 --> 00:00:52.460
 let's see what it really brings 

00:00:51.800 --> 00:00:55.250
 this rom 

00:00:52.460 --> 00:00:58.910
 let's go to phone information and 

00:00:55.250 --> 00:01:00.800
 we see that it really carries version 411 

00:00:58.910 --> 00:01:05.330
 from android 

00:01:00.800 --> 00:01:07.460
 our gti 9.100 which is the galaxy s2 

00:01:05.330 --> 00:01:09.390
 version of the baseband in the l cross 

00:01:07.460 --> 00:01:12.120
 is the radio the modem 

00:01:09.390 --> 00:01:15.060
 in the kernel version is a piano that 

00:01:12.120 --> 00:01:18.900
 is based on 100 hear and the version of 

00:01:15.060 --> 00:01:22.680
 the rom is the super nexus as you see there and 

00:01:18.900 --> 00:01:25.350
 9.100 wheel 2 of 11 of 8 of 2012 is 

00:01:22.680 --> 00:01:27.360
 constantly removing updates 

00:01:25.350 --> 00:01:29.310
 with which I leave the link to the 

00:01:27.360 --> 00:01:32.159
 page from a from its creator to 

00:01:29.310 --> 00:01:35.460
 that you can download possible 

00:01:32.159 --> 00:01:38.159
 updates and other good to tell you 

00:01:35.460 --> 00:01:41.340
 that works very very lightly because it is 

00:01:38.159 --> 00:01:45.540
 a pretty fast rom works very 

00:01:41.340 --> 00:01:48.070
 well and tell you also what 

00:01:45.540 --> 00:01:49.630
 Well I justito 

00:01:48.070 --> 00:01:52.120
 once we have installed the 

00:01:49.630 --> 00:01:54.100
 break is to enter the market or install not 

00:01:52.120 --> 00:01:56.470
 just recover the applications with the 

00:01:54.100 --> 00:01:58.479
 titanium that we had installed before 

00:01:56.470 --> 00:02:01.600
 because what you see you only have 

00:01:58.479 --> 00:02:03.490
 these programs but they really work 

00:02:01.600 --> 00:02:06.300
 very very well is a very fluid branch and 

00:02:03.490 --> 00:02:06.300
 very fast 

00:02:07.020 --> 00:02:13.709
 and some additional options like 

00:02:10.200 --> 00:02:18.379
 They can be sensor screens functions 

00:02:13.709 --> 00:02:18.379
 Optical doc etc good 

00:02:21.180 --> 00:02:25.189
 the contacts are ad hoc type ap 

00:02:25.240 --> 00:02:28.320
 the messages too 

00:02:28.680 --> 00:02:33.890
 the most very fast browser 

00:02:31.790 --> 00:02:37.719
 and start everything very well and as 

00:02:33.890 --> 00:02:37.719
 test we could do the search 

00:02:38.660 --> 00:02:42.490
 port of rotterdam 

00:02:43.819 --> 00:02:50.450
 Well we found it the 

00:02:46.280 --> 00:02:52.330
 First, I said that as I could 

00:02:50.450 --> 00:02:54.860
 have said 

00:02:52.330 --> 00:02:57.620
 the clowns on TV 

00:02:54.860 --> 00:03:00.350
 well then we see that it is a very 

00:02:57.620 --> 00:03:02.290
 fluid and very fast let's see if 

00:03:00.350 --> 00:03:05.480
 We are really looking at a jelly bean 

00:03:02.290 --> 00:03:08.000
 to find out we have to give it several 

00:03:05.480 --> 00:03:10.570
 touches on the version of good android 

00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:10.570
 here we have it 

00:03:10.680 --> 00:03:17.640
 it is android 411 of living 

00:03:15.360 --> 00:03:19.260
 Well, I've said it for everyone 

00:03:17.640 --> 00:03:20.670
 those that you want to download it 

00:03:19.260 --> 00:03:23.250

00:03:20.670 --> 00:03:26.610

00:03:23.250 --> 00:03:29.010
