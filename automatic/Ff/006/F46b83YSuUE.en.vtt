so<00:00:13.900> with<00:00:14.230> our<00:00:14.410> web<00:00:14.620> pared<00:00:14.980> and<00:00:15.370> our<00:00:15.550> shoulder

00:00:16.289 --> 00:00:16.299 
so with our web pared and our shoulder

00:00:16.299 --> 00:00:18.420 
so with our web pared and our shoulder
chopped<00:00:16.600> now<00:00:17.350> it's<00:00:17.529> time<00:00:17.710> to<00:00:17.740> clean<00:00:18.130> up<00:00:18.310> the

chopped now it's time to clean up the

00:00:18.430 --> 00:00:21.720 
chopped now it's time to clean up the
corners<00:00:19.080> you<00:00:20.080> need<00:00:20.349> to<00:00:20.650> take<00:00:21.340> a<00:00:21.369> few<00:00:21.610> minutes

00:00:21.720 --> 00:00:21.730 
corners you need to take a few minutes

00:00:21.730 --> 00:00:24.570 
corners you need to take a few minutes
get<00:00:22.180> these<00:00:22.390> tidied<00:00:22.930> up<00:00:23.220> before<00:00:24.220> you<00:00:24.310> try<00:00:24.520> to

00:00:24.570 --> 00:00:24.580 
get these tidied up before you try to

and the shearing with the scraper began

00:00:32.680 --> 00:00:35.210 
and the shearing with the scraper began
in<00:00:32.860> there<00:00:33.040> and<00:00:33.940> that<00:00:34.239> would<00:00:34.480> have<00:00:34.720> been

00:00:35.210 --> 00:00:35.220

drives<00:01:25.930> into<00:01:26.260> it<00:01:26.409> it's<00:01:26.650> going<00:01:26.920> to<00:01:27.040> start<00:01:27.370> to

00:01:27.450 --> 00:01:27.460 
drives into it it's going to start to

00:01:27.460 --> 00:01:31.830 
drives into it it's going to start to
bind<00:01:27.790> up<00:01:28.030> the<00:01:28.780> two<00:01:29.110> ends<00:01:29.850> pins<00:01:30.850> worried<00:01:31.570> me<00:01:31.810> the

00:01:31.830 --> 00:01:31.840 
bind up the two ends pins worried me the

00:01:31.840 --> 00:01:34.620 
bind up the two ends pins worried me the
most<00:01:32.020> there's<00:01:32.740> a<00:01:32.830> chance<00:01:33.159> for<00:01:33.299> cracking<00:01:34.299> when

00:01:34.620 --> 00:01:34.630 
most there's a chance for cracking when

00:01:34.630 --> 00:01:36.870 
most there's a chance for cracking when
the<00:01:34.720> pins<00:01:34.990> are<00:01:35.170> fairly<00:01:35.440> fine<00:01:35.830> so<00:01:36.490> you<00:01:36.580> just

00:01:36.870 --> 00:01:36.880 
the pins are fairly fine so you just

00:01:36.880 --> 00:01:39.810 
the pins are fairly fine so you just
want<00:01:37.090> to<00:01:37.150> make<00:01:37.299> sure<00:01:37.330> that<00:01:37.690> you<00:01:37.870> have<00:01:38.820> gotten

00:01:39.810 --> 00:01:39.820 
want to make sure that you have gotten

00:01:39.820 --> 00:01:42.859 
want to make sure that you have gotten
all<00:01:39.940> the<00:01:40.240> excess<00:01:40.630> material<00:01:40.780> out<00:01:41.770> of<00:01:41.979> here<00:01:42.280> and

00:01:42.859 --> 00:01:42.869 
all the excess material out of here and

00:01:42.869 --> 00:01:48.870 
all the excess material out of here and
then<00:01:43.869> comes<00:01:44.200> time<00:01:44.470> to<00:01:44.799> fit<00:01:45.610> it<00:01:47.010> if<00:01:48.010> your<00:01:48.369> paring

00:01:48.870 --> 00:01:48.880 
then comes time to fit it if your paring

00:01:48.880 --> 00:01:52.260 
then comes time to fit it if your paring
went<00:01:49.119> well<00:01:49.360> with<00:01:49.720> the<00:01:50.049> the<00:01:50.950> shim<00:01:51.280> that<00:01:51.940> your

00:01:52.260 --> 00:01:52.270 
went well with the the shim that your

00:01:52.270 --> 00:01:55.289 
went well with the the shim that your
web<00:01:52.570> should<00:01:53.260> be<00:01:53.320> just<00:01:54.130> nice<00:01:54.340> and<00:01:54.369> flat<00:01:54.970> across

00:01:55.289 --> 00:01:55.299 
web should be just nice and flat across

00:01:55.299 --> 00:01:59.039 
web should be just nice and flat across
here<00:01:55.689> there<00:01:56.049> shouldn't<00:01:56.409> be<00:01:56.500> any<00:01:57.810> bumps<00:01:58.810> there

00:01:59.039 --> 00:01:59.049 
here there shouldn't be any bumps there

00:01:59.049 --> 00:02:02.960 
here there shouldn't be any bumps there
you<00:01:59.500> can<00:01:59.680> check<00:01:59.920> with<00:02:00.040> the<00:02:00.100> square<00:02:00.460> also<00:02:00.930> so

00:02:02.960 --> 00:02:02.970 
you can check with the square also so

00:02:02.970 --> 00:02:09.270 
you can check with the square also so
shot<00:02:03.970> the<00:02:05.640> fitting<00:02:06.640> of<00:02:06.790> dovetails<00:02:07.500> a<00:02:08.500> lot<00:02:09.159> of

00:02:09.270 --> 00:02:09.280 
shot the fitting of dovetails a lot of

00:02:09.280 --> 00:02:11.880 
shot the fitting of dovetails a lot of
times<00:02:09.489> you<00:02:09.670> can<00:02:09.849> hear<00:02:10.330> where<00:02:11.140> dovetail<00:02:11.769> is

00:02:11.880 --> 00:02:11.890 
times you can hear where dovetail is

00:02:11.890 --> 00:02:13.789 
times you can hear where dovetail is
moving<00:02:12.370> and<00:02:12.670> where<00:02:12.879> it's<00:02:13.030> not<00:02:13.209> moving

00:02:13.789 --> 00:02:13.799 
moving and where it's not moving

00:02:13.799 --> 00:02:17.009 
moving and where it's not moving
sometimes<00:02:14.799> a<00:02:15.069> small<00:02:15.790> metal<00:02:16.209> hammer<00:02:16.480> although

00:02:17.009 --> 00:02:17.019 
sometimes a small metal hammer although

00:02:17.019 --> 00:02:19.530 
sometimes a small metal hammer although
it<00:02:17.110> can<00:02:17.260> dent<00:02:17.470> the<00:02:17.620> work<00:02:17.830> if<00:02:18.040> your<00:02:18.330> Thor<00:02:19.330> the

00:02:19.530 --> 00:02:19.540 
it can dent the work if your Thor the

00:02:19.540 --> 00:02:23.190 
it can dent the work if your Thor the
destroyer<00:02:19.989> with<00:02:20.319> it<00:02:20.730> can<00:02:21.730> be<00:02:21.849> very<00:02:22.180> useful<00:02:22.480> in

00:02:23.190 --> 00:02:23.200 
destroyer with it can be very useful in

00:02:23.200 --> 00:02:25.059 
destroyer with it can be very useful in
hearing<00:02:23.769> how<00:02:24.189> where<00:02:24.579> its<00:02:24.760> move

00:02:25.059 --> 00:02:25.069 
hearing how where its move

00:02:25.069 --> 00:02:27.729 
hearing how where its move
you're<00:02:25.159> not<00:02:25.310> moving<00:02:25.609> high<00:02:26.510> tones<00:02:26.870> means<00:02:27.499> it's

00:02:27.729 --> 00:02:27.739 
you're not moving high tones means it's

00:02:27.739 --> 00:02:30.640 
you're not moving high tones means it's
moving<00:02:28.359> low<00:02:29.359> tones<00:02:29.659> means<00:02:29.959> it's<00:02:30.109> not<00:02:30.230> moving

00:02:30.640 --> 00:02:30.650 
moving low tones means it's not moving

00:02:30.650 --> 00:02:33.250 
moving low tones means it's not moving
so<00:02:30.920> you<00:02:31.430> can<00:02:31.609> go<00:02:31.760> through<00:02:32.150> the<00:02:32.269> joint<00:02:32.540> moving

00:02:33.250 --> 00:02:33.260 
so you can go through the joint moving

00:02:33.260 --> 00:02:35.770 
so you can go through the joint moving
here<00:02:33.560> moving<00:02:33.950> a<00:02:34.069> little<00:02:34.819> bit<00:02:35.060> snugger<00:02:35.389> on<00:02:35.599> this

00:02:35.770 --> 00:02:35.780 
here moving a little bit snugger on this

00:02:35.780 --> 00:02:38.589 
here moving a little bit snugger on this
pin<00:02:36.049> the<00:02:36.739> end<00:02:36.950> ones<00:02:37.219> are<00:02:37.609> the<00:02:37.939> ones<00:02:38.120> I<00:02:38.329> worry

00:02:38.589 --> 00:02:38.599 
pin the end ones are the ones I worry

to take a block put it over the top push

00:02:56.419 --> 00:02:58.390 
to take a block put it over the top push
them<00:02:56.659> down<00:02:56.689> in<00:02:57.139> just<00:02:57.530> to<00:02:57.650> make<00:02:57.799> sure<00:02:58.010> you<00:02:58.159> don't
