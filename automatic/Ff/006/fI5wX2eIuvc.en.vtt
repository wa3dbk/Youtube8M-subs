one of the problems of course at the

00:00:52.680 --> 00:00:54.470 
one of the problems of course at the
moment<00:00:53.039> is<00:00:53.160> that<00:00:53.190> what<00:00:53.969> a<00:00:54.000> lot<00:00:54.120> of<00:00:54.210> the<00:00:54.270> chain

00:00:54.470 --> 00:00:54.480 
moment is that what a lot of the chain

00:00:54.480 --> 00:00:57.139 
moment is that what a lot of the chain
to<00:00:54.510> do<00:00:54.780> is<00:00:55.410> just<00:00:55.680> a<00:00:55.800> one<00:00:56.100> cup<00:00:56.340> of<00:00:56.370> coffee<00:00:56.730> with
