procedures for proper prep obviously for

00:00:45.539 --> 00:00:46.970 
procedures for proper prep obviously for
dealing<00:00:45.750> with<00:00:45.870> the<00:00:46.079> wood<00:00:46.320> surface<00:00:46.530> we're

00:00:46.970 --> 00:00:46.980 
dealing with the wood surface we're

00:00:46.980 --> 00:00:50.150 
dealing with the wood surface we're
going<00:00:47.129> to<00:00:47.190> want<00:00:47.399> to<00:00:47.550> sand<00:00:48.420> that<00:00:48.629> surface<00:00:49.140> yep

00:00:57.750 --> 00:01:00.079 
glaze off the machine if you will yep
absolutely<00:00:58.530> and<00:00:58.769> you<00:00:59.339> know<00:00:59.460> with<00:00:59.670> concrete

00:01:00.079 --> 00:01:00.089 
absolutely and you know with concrete

00:01:00.089 --> 00:01:02.810 
absolutely and you know with concrete
interior<00:01:00.660> concrete<00:01:01.199> we<00:01:01.829> realize<00:01:02.190> that<00:01:02.219> you

00:01:02.810 --> 00:01:02.820 
interior concrete we realize that you

00:01:02.820 --> 00:01:05.119 
interior concrete we realize that you
know<00:01:02.940> although<00:01:03.149> you<00:01:04.110> know<00:01:04.199> using<00:01:04.410> etch<00:01:04.739> or

00:01:05.119 --> 00:01:05.129 
know although you know using etch or

00:01:05.129 --> 00:01:07.670 
know although you know using etch or
mechanical<00:01:06.000> grind<00:01:06.270> is<00:01:06.510> is<00:01:06.810> the<00:01:07.230> preferred

00:01:07.670 --> 00:01:07.680 
mechanical grind is is the preferred

00:01:07.680 --> 00:01:10.160 
mechanical grind is is the preferred
method<00:01:07.710> of<00:01:08.280> prep<00:01:08.790> we<00:01:09.480> know<00:01:09.600> that<00:01:09.780> that's<00:01:09.900> not

00:01:10.160 --> 00:01:10.170 
method of prep we know that that's not

00:01:10.170 --> 00:01:11.899 
method of prep we know that that's not
always<00:01:10.320> possible<00:01:10.590> because<00:01:11.010> there<00:01:11.340> are<00:01:11.490> drains

00:01:11.899 --> 00:01:11.909 
always possible because there are drains

00:01:11.909 --> 00:01:13.999 
always possible because there are drains
or<00:01:12.210> it's<00:01:12.360> just<00:01:12.420> impossible<00:01:13.020> to<00:01:13.350> use<00:01:13.590> equipment

00:01:13.999 --> 00:01:14.009 
or it's just impossible to use equipment

00:01:14.009 --> 00:01:16.219 
or it's just impossible to use equipment
you<00:01:14.310> know<00:01:14.400> inside<00:01:14.759> there<00:01:15.210> so<00:01:15.750> you<00:01:15.869> just<00:01:15.930> want

00:01:16.219 --> 00:01:16.229 
you know inside there so you just want

00:01:16.229 --> 00:01:18.050 
you know inside there so you just want
to<00:01:16.259> make<00:01:16.409> sure<00:01:16.439> that<00:01:16.799> the<00:01:16.920> substrate<00:01:17.189> is<00:01:17.490> free

00:01:18.050 --> 00:01:18.060 
to make sure that the substrate is free

00:01:18.060 --> 00:01:20.749 
to make sure that the substrate is free
and<00:01:18.240> clear<00:01:18.750> of<00:01:19.070> contaminants<00:01:20.070> and<00:01:20.159> dust<00:01:20.460> and

00:01:20.749 --> 00:01:20.759

system with the poly key remain clear

00:02:30.860 --> 00:02:33.560 
system with the poly key remain clear
you<00:02:31.860> would<00:02:32.010> be<00:02:32.130> spreading<00:02:32.520> at<00:02:32.670> 250<00:02:33.390> square

00:02:33.560 --> 00:02:33.570 
you would be spreading at 250 square

00:02:33.570 --> 00:02:34.460 
you would be spreading at 250 square
feet<00:02:33.840> per<00:02:33.990> gallon

00:02:34.460 --> 00:02:34.470

once<00:03:44.550> I<00:03:44.700> M&amp;W<00:03:45.150> the<00:03:45.510> product<00:03:45.900> out<00:03:46.640> the<00:03:47.640> next<00:03:47.910> step

00:03:48.740 --> 00:03:48.750 
once I M&amp;W the product out the next step

00:03:48.750 --> 00:03:50.600 
once I M&amp;W the product out the next step
that<00:03:48.780> I<00:03:48.990> need<00:03:49.110> to<00:03:49.380> do<00:03:49.500> and<00:03:49.740> this<00:03:49.830> will<00:03:50.070> create

00:04:04.910 --> 00:04:04.920 
that for every section that I do just

00:04:04.920 --> 00:04:07.130 
that for every section that I do just

00:04:07.130 --> 00:04:07.140 
like the one I did here they can be

00:04:07.140 --> 00:04:09.620 
like the one I did here they can be
random<00:04:07.680> you<00:04:07.830> can<00:04:07.980> be<00:04:08.160> uniform<00:04:08.730> whatever<00:04:09.180> you

00:04:09.620 --> 00:04:09.630
