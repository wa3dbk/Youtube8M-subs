00:01:02.869 --> 00:01:02.879 
the sunflower to the car so you can see

00:01:02.879 --> 00:01:04.700 
the sunflower to the car so you can see
it<00:01:03.059> rotates<00:01:03.420> around<00:01:03.569> and<00:01:03.870> then<00:01:03.960> boom<00:01:04.170> there's

00:01:04.700 --> 00:01:04.710 
it rotates around and then boom there's

00:01:04.710 --> 00:01:07.450 
it rotates around and then boom there's
a<00:01:04.800> sunflower<00:01:05.190> I<00:01:05.430> think<00:01:05.670> that's<00:01:05.850> pretty<00:01:06.540> slick

00:01:07.450 --> 00:01:07.460 
a sunflower I think that's pretty slick

00:01:07.460 --> 00:01:09.410 
a sunflower I think that's pretty slick
so<00:01:08.460> what<00:01:08.579> we'll<00:01:08.700> do<00:01:08.820> is<00:01:08.850> we'll<00:01:09.090> go<00:01:09.240> ahead<00:01:09.329> and

00:01:09.410 --> 00:01:09.420 
so what we'll do is we'll go ahead and

00:01:09.420 --> 00:01:11.600 
so what we'll do is we'll go ahead and
pick<00:01:09.630> that<00:01:09.659> car<00:01:10.079> and<00:01:10.290> we'll<00:01:10.829> jump<00:01:11.040> into<00:01:11.189> a<00:01:11.340> race

00:01:11.600 --> 00:01:11.610 
pick that car and we'll jump into a race

00:01:11.610 --> 00:01:13.249 
pick that car and we'll jump into a race
so<00:01:11.880> you<00:01:11.939> can<00:01:12.060> get<00:01:12.180> an<00:01:12.299> idea<00:01:12.390> for<00:01:12.659> the<00:01:12.840> graphics

00:01:13.249 --> 00:01:13.259 
so you can get an idea for the graphics

00:01:13.259 --> 00:01:14.990 
so you can get an idea for the graphics

going<00:01:51.810> to<00:01:52.020> see<00:01:52.170> classes<00:01:52.649> much<00:01:53.039> much<00:01:53.340> more<00:01:53.670> more

00:01:54.649 --> 00:01:54.659 
going to see classes much much more more

00:01:54.659 --> 00:01:58.310 
going to see classes much much more more
difficult<00:01:56.689> but<00:01:57.689> this<00:01:57.810> kind<00:01:57.960> of<00:01:58.049> gives<00:01:58.170> you<00:01:58.259> a

00:01:58.310 --> 00:01:58.320 
difficult but this kind of gives you a

00:01:58.320 --> 00:02:01.160 
difficult but this kind of gives you a
general<00:01:58.530> idea<00:01:58.710> of<00:01:58.979> the<00:01:59.189> controls<00:01:59.820> and<00:02:00.170> the

00:02:01.160 --> 00:02:01.170 
general idea of the controls and the

00:02:01.170 --> 00:02:03.080 
general idea of the controls and the
performance<00:02:01.740> of<00:02:01.799> the<00:02:01.890> cars<00:02:02.130> what<00:02:02.969> I'm<00:02:03.060> going

00:02:03.080 --> 00:02:03.090 
performance of the cars what I'm going

00:02:03.090 --> 00:02:05.149 
performance of the cars what I'm going
to<00:02:03.240> show<00:02:03.359> you<00:02:03.450> next<00:02:03.749> give<00:02:04.649> you<00:02:04.740> a<00:02:04.770> general<00:02:04.920> idea

00:02:05.149 --> 00:02:05.159 
to show you next give you a general idea

00:02:05.159 --> 00:02:07.880 
to show you next give you a general idea
is<00:02:05.520> the<00:02:06.270> ghost<00:02:06.509> racing<00:02:06.990> so<00:02:07.229> I'll<00:02:07.560> go<00:02:07.710> ahead<00:02:07.740> and

00:02:07.880 --> 00:02:07.890 
is the ghost racing so I'll go ahead and

00:02:07.890 --> 00:02:09.740 
is the ghost racing so I'll go ahead and
stop<00:02:08.160> this<00:02:08.340> actually<00:02:08.729> was<00:02:09.090> right<00:02:09.300> before<00:02:09.450> I<00:02:09.600> go

00:02:09.740 --> 00:02:09.750 
stop this actually was right before I go

00:02:09.750 --> 00:02:12.800 
stop this actually was right before I go
into<00:02:09.780> the<00:02:10.050> wall<00:02:10.229> I'll<00:02:10.770> quit<00:02:11.099> yes<00:02:12.090> we'll<00:02:12.720> go

00:02:12.800 --> 00:02:12.810 
into the wall I'll quit yes we'll go

00:02:12.810 --> 00:02:14.059 
into the wall I'll quit yes we'll go
into<00:02:12.930> time<00:02:13.230> trial<00:02:13.620> and<00:02:13.769> that's<00:02:13.890> where<00:02:14.040> it

00:02:14.059 --> 00:02:14.069 
into time trial and that's where it

00:02:14.069 --> 00:02:15.410 
into time trial and that's where it
allows<00:02:14.250> you<00:02:14.459> to<00:02:14.610> upload

00:03:34.759 --> 00:03:34.769 
they said they might be adding that so

00:03:34.769 --> 00:03:36.050 
they said they might be adding that so
you<00:03:34.829> can<00:03:34.890> see<00:03:35.070> I'm<00:03:35.190> number<00:03:35.489> four<00:03:35.700> thousand

00:03:36.050 --> 00:03:36.060

five<00:03:36.239> eleven<00:03:36.900> out<00:03:37.049> of<00:03:37.320> times<00:03:37.709> but<00:03:38.430> if<00:03:38.549> I<00:03:38.640> scroll

00:03:39.020 --> 00:03:39.030 
five eleven out of times but if I scroll

00:03:39.030 --> 00:03:41.150 
five eleven out of times but if I scroll
to<00:03:39.239> let's<00:03:39.420> say<00:03:39.570> the<00:03:39.690> very<00:03:39.810> top<00:03:40.200> takes<00:03:40.920> me<00:03:41.040> to

00:03:41.150 --> 00:03:41.160 
to let's say the very top takes me to

00:03:41.160 --> 00:03:45.110 
to let's say the very top takes me to
4461<00:03:42.000> and<00:03:42.450> the<00:03:42.570> end<00:03:42.750> is<00:03:43.130> 45<00:03:44.130> 60<00:03:44.609> so<00:03:44.760> I<00:03:44.790> only<00:03:44.940> have

00:03:45.110 --> 00:03:45.120 
4461 and the end is 45 60 so I only have

00:03:45.120 --> 00:03:47.360 
4461 and the end is 45 60 so I only have
that<00:03:45.299> range<00:03:45.630> but<00:03:46.079> I<00:03:46.140> can<00:03:46.320> watch<00:03:46.530> it<00:03:46.739> and<00:03:46.890> if<00:03:47.280> I

00:03:47.360 --> 00:03:47.370 
that range but I can watch it and if I

00:03:47.370 --> 00:03:49.810 
that range but I can watch it and if I
tap<00:03:47.700> this<00:03:47.970> it'll<00:03:48.540> actually<00:03:48.750> load<00:03:49.200> that<00:03:49.500> ghost

00:03:49.810 --> 00:03:49.820 
tap this it'll actually load that ghost

00:03:49.820 --> 00:03:53.180 
tap this it'll actually load that ghost
so<00:03:50.820> kind<00:03:51.600> of<00:03:51.720> there<00:03:51.870> you<00:03:52.079> there<00:03:52.739> you<00:03:52.799> have<00:03:53.160> it
