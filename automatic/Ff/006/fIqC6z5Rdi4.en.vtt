because such as the life searching store

00:00:57.690 --> 00:00:59.270 
because such as the life searching store
players<00:00:57.899> it's<00:00:58.170> entertaining<00:00:58.620> to<00:00:58.739> watch<00:00:58.859> them

00:00:59.270 --> 00:00:59.280

00:01:02.720 --> 00:01:02.730 
streaks will never really do as well as

00:01:02.730 --> 00:01:04.429 
streaks will never really do as well as
they<00:01:02.910> would<00:01:03.210> in<00:01:03.449> respawn<00:01:03.870> game<00:01:04.049> modes<00:01:04.260> where

00:01:04.429 --> 00:01:04.439 
they would in respawn game modes where

00:01:04.439 --> 00:01:06.500 
they would in respawn game modes where
people<00:01:04.739> will<00:01:04.890> die<00:01:05.100> respawn<00:01:05.700> outside<00:01:06.119> and<00:01:06.420> just

00:01:06.500 --> 00:01:06.510 
people will die respawn outside and just

00:01:06.510 --> 00:01:08.359 
people will die respawn outside and just
get<00:01:06.689> annihilated<00:01:07.080> by<00:01:07.500> the<00:01:07.650> same<00:01:07.979> kill<00:01:08.159> streak

00:01:08.359 --> 00:01:08.369 
get annihilated by the same kill streak

00:01:08.369 --> 00:01:11.870 
get annihilated by the same kill streak
again<00:01:09.260> it<00:01:10.260> is<00:01:10.380> kind<00:01:10.619> of<00:01:10.680> fun<00:01:10.860> wrecking<00:01:11.640> people

00:01:11.870 --> 00:01:11.880 
again it is kind of fun wrecking people

00:01:11.880 --> 00:01:13.010 
again it is kind of fun wrecking people
like<00:01:12.000> this<00:01:12.180> in<00:01:12.360> the<00:01:12.420> first<00:01:12.630> round<00:01:12.810> when

00:01:13.010 --> 00:01:13.020 
like this in the first round when

00:01:13.020 --> 00:01:14.330 
like this in the first round when
they're<00:01:13.170> trying<00:01:13.380> to<00:01:13.409> sit<00:01:13.590> and<00:01:13.680> spawn<00:01:13.950> and<00:01:14.220> they

00:01:14.330 --> 00:01:14.340 
they're trying to sit and spawn and they

00:01:14.340 --> 00:01:16.399 
they're trying to sit and spawn and they
realize<00:01:14.700> that<00:01:14.729> you<00:01:15.479> just<00:01:15.509> annihilate<00:01:16.200> them

00:01:16.399 --> 00:01:16.409 
realize that you just annihilate them

00:01:16.409 --> 00:01:18.410 
realize that you just annihilate them
and<00:01:16.619> that<00:01:17.189> they<00:01:17.460> if<00:01:17.729> they<00:01:17.880> sit<00:01:18.060> in<00:01:18.090> the<00:01:18.210> spawn

00:01:18.410 --> 00:01:18.420 
and that they if they sit in the spawn

00:01:18.420 --> 00:01:19.700 
and that they if they sit in the spawn
it's<00:01:18.630> just<00:01:18.750> gonna<00:01:18.869> it's<00:01:19.259> not<00:01:19.320> gonna<00:01:19.500> end<00:01:19.590> well

00:01:19.700 --> 00:01:19.710 
it's just gonna it's not gonna end well

00:01:19.710 --> 00:01:22.460 
it's just gonna it's not gonna end well
and<00:01:20.360> after<00:01:21.360> this<00:01:21.450> first<00:01:21.630> round<00:01:21.869> they<00:01:22.110> decide

00:01:22.460 --> 00:01:22.470 
and after this first round they decide

00:01:22.470 --> 00:01:23.719 
and after this first round they decide
that<00:01:22.500> that<00:01:22.680> is<00:01:22.890> probably<00:01:23.159> not<00:01:23.280> a<00:01:23.340> very<00:01:23.430> smart

00:01:23.719 --> 00:01:23.729 
that that is probably not a very smart

00:01:23.729 --> 00:01:26.420 
that that is probably not a very smart
idea<00:01:23.939> so<00:01:24.270> they<00:01:24.360> stop<00:01:24.600> doing<00:01:24.780> it<00:01:24.990> I<00:01:25.200> mean<00:01:26.070> I've

00:01:26.420 --> 00:01:26.430 
idea so they stop doing it I mean I've

00:01:26.430 --> 00:01:27.980 
idea so they stop doing it I mean I've
walbank<00:01:26.909> one<00:01:27.119> guy<00:01:27.240> right<00:01:27.450> there<00:01:27.479> and<00:01:27.810> I<00:01:27.840> get

00:01:27.980 --> 00:01:27.990 
walbank one guy right there and I get

00:01:27.990 --> 00:01:29.990 
walbank one guy right there and I get
the<00:01:28.110> hit<00:01:28.229> marker<00:01:28.560> to<00:01:28.680> scare<00:01:28.950> him<00:01:29.070> off<00:01:29.159> and<00:01:29.520> he
