will<00:02:14.849> pause<00:02:15.239> this<00:02:15.540> video<00:02:15.720> and<00:02:16.080> find<00:02:16.830> my<00:02:17.010> spawn

00:02:18.460 --> 00:02:18.470 
will pause this video and find my spawn

00:02:18.470 --> 00:02:22.070 
will pause this video and find my spawn
alright<00:02:19.470> how<00:02:19.709> foolish<00:02:20.099> of<00:02:20.459> me<00:02:20.489> I<00:02:21.150> would<00:02:21.630> I<00:02:21.870> was

00:02:22.070 --> 00:02:22.080 
alright how foolish of me I would I was

00:02:22.080 --> 00:02:24.680 
alright how foolish of me I would I was
spawned<00:02:22.440> right<00:02:22.560> next<00:02:22.890> to<00:02:22.950> my<00:02:23.180> plane<00:02:24.180> and<00:02:24.420> my

00:02:24.680 --> 00:02:24.690 
spawned right next to my plane and my

00:02:24.690 --> 00:02:27.259 
spawned right next to my plane and my
crafting<00:02:25.110> bench<00:02:25.290> but<00:02:25.650> I<00:02:26.099> know<00:02:26.790> where<00:02:27.000> it<00:02:27.120> is

00:02:27.259 --> 00:02:27.269 
crafting bench but I know where it is

00:02:27.269 --> 00:02:29.839 
crafting bench but I know where it is
alright<00:02:27.660> so<00:02:27.930> here<00:02:28.650> we<00:02:28.830> got<00:02:29.069> the<00:02:29.250> actual<00:02:29.610> plane

00:02:29.839 --> 00:02:29.849 
alright so here we got the actual plane

00:02:29.849 --> 00:02:31.640 
alright so here we got the actual plane
and<00:02:30.120> I<00:02:30.180> do<00:02:30.239> think<00:02:30.810> I<00:02:30.989> will<00:02:31.200> crash<00:02:31.620> because

00:02:31.640 --> 00:02:31.650 
and I do think I will crash because

00:02:31.650 --> 00:02:35.059 
and I do think I will crash because
there<00:02:32.280> is<00:02:32.489> sand<00:02:32.849> right<00:02:33.269> near<00:02:33.599> us<00:02:33.780> but<00:02:33.959> this<00:02:34.860> is

00:02:35.059 --> 00:02:35.069 
there is sand right near us but this is

00:02:35.069 --> 00:02:36.530 
there is sand right near us but this is
proof<00:02:35.400> that<00:02:35.640> it<00:02:35.910> works

00:02:36.530 --> 00:02:36.540 
proof that it works

00:02:36.540 --> 00:02:39.559 
proof that it works
so<00:02:36.900> hopefully<00:02:37.459> the<00:02:38.459> direction<00:02:38.940> of<00:02:39.060> Preston

00:02:39.559 --> 00:02:39.569 
so hopefully the direction of Preston

00:02:39.569 --> 00:02:46.160 
so hopefully the direction of Preston
jump<00:02:40.190> to<00:02:41.190> jump<00:02:41.220> in<00:02:42.950> and<00:02:43.950> start<00:02:44.280> the<00:02:44.430> motor<00:02:45.170> come

00:02:46.160 --> 00:02:46.170 
jump to jump in and start the motor come

00:02:46.170 --> 00:02:49.580 
jump to jump in and start the motor come
on<00:02:46.319> start<00:02:46.620> flying<00:02:46.920> I<00:02:47.810> think<00:02:48.810> we<00:02:48.900> can't<00:02:49.110> fly<00:02:49.350> cuz

00:02:49.580 --> 00:02:49.590 
on start flying I think we can't fly cuz

00:02:49.590 --> 00:02:54.550 
on start flying I think we can't fly cuz
there's<00:02:49.799> sand<00:02:50.370> in<00:02:50.489> the<00:02:50.610> way<00:02:50.790> oh<00:02:52.190> dear<00:02:53.220> get<00:02:53.850> out

00:02:54.550 --> 00:02:54.560 
there's sand in the way oh dear get out

00:02:54.560 --> 00:03:02.990 
there's sand in the way oh dear get out
this<00:02:55.560> wrecks<00:02:55.860> everything<00:03:00.380> this<00:03:01.380> oh<00:03:01.650> no<00:03:02.430> no<00:03:02.730> no

00:03:02.990 --> 00:03:03.000 
this wrecks everything this oh no no no

00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:05.570 
this wrecks everything this oh no no no
no<00:03:03.260> alright<00:03:04.260> so<00:03:04.500> this<00:03:04.799> is<00:03:04.950> just<00:03:05.069> proof<00:03:05.370> of

00:03:05.570 --> 00:03:05.580 
no alright so this is just proof of

00:03:05.580 --> 00:03:08.449 
no alright so this is just proof of
concept<00:03:06.090> that<00:03:06.150> the<00:03:06.510> plane<00:03:06.900> works<00:03:07.500> well<00:03:08.370> it

00:03:08.449 --> 00:03:08.459 
concept that the plane works well it

00:03:08.459 --> 00:03:10.520 
concept that the plane works well it
didn't<00:03:08.700> fly<00:03:08.940> but<00:03:09.510> you<00:03:09.900> know<00:03:10.019> what<00:03:10.170> I<00:03:10.200> mean

00:03:10.520 --> 00:03:10.530 
didn't fly but you know what I mean

00:03:10.530 --> 00:03:12.050 
didn't fly but you know what I mean
it<00:03:10.620> works<00:03:10.890> so<00:03:11.130> thanks<00:03:11.459> that's<00:03:11.670> wise<00:03:11.850> you<00:03:12.000> know
