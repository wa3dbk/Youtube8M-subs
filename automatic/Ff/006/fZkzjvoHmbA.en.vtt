00:01:58.670 --> 00:01:58.680 
the game fixes itself out what you'd end

00:01:58.680 --> 00:02:01.969 
the game fixes itself out what you'd end
up<00:01:58.740> doing<00:01:59.600> but<00:02:00.600> yeah<00:02:00.990> his<00:02:01.229> main<00:02:01.469> route<00:02:01.770> was

00:02:01.969 --> 00:02:01.979 
up doing but yeah his main route was

00:02:01.979 --> 00:02:04.459 
up doing but yeah his main route was
that<00:02:02.159> uh<00:02:02.189> right<00:02:03.060> out<00:02:03.240> the<00:02:03.420> back<00:02:03.630> field<00:02:03.990> he<00:02:04.320> had

00:02:04.459 --> 00:02:04.469 
that uh right out the back field he had

00:02:04.469 --> 00:02:06.380 
that uh right out the back field he had
him<00:02:04.619> on<00:02:04.649> a<00:02:04.710> fade<00:02:05.070> and<00:02:05.369> I<00:02:05.520> I<00:02:05.850> think<00:02:06.149> he<00:02:06.240> would

00:02:06.380 --> 00:02:06.390 
him on a fade and I I think he would

00:02:06.390 --> 00:02:08.240 
him on a fade and I I think he would
precision<00:02:06.869> inside<00:02:07.320> but<00:02:07.590> it<00:02:07.710> was<00:02:07.829> tearing<00:02:08.160> up

00:02:08.240 --> 00:02:08.250 
precision inside but it was tearing up

00:02:08.250 --> 00:02:10.369 
precision inside but it was tearing up
the<00:02:08.399> man<00:02:08.580> defense<00:02:09.000> pretty<00:02:09.629> much<00:02:09.810> every<00:02:10.110> time

00:02:10.369 --> 00:02:10.379 
the man defense pretty much every time

00:02:10.379 --> 00:02:12.380 
the man defense pretty much every time
and<00:02:10.770> they<00:02:11.129> need<00:02:11.310> run<00:02:11.610> bench

00:02:12.380 --> 00:02:12.390
