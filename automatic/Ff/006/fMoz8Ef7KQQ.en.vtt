going to learn how to draw butterflies

00:00:05.240 --> 00:00:08.120 
going to learn how to draw butterflies
the<00:00:06.240> first<00:00:06.450> thing<00:00:06.600> you<00:00:06.690> want<00:00:06.870> to<00:00:06.930> do<00:00:07.109> is<00:00:07.919> you

the first thing you want to do is you
want<00:00:08.280> to<00:00:08.309> think<00:00:08.370> about<00:00:08.639> on<00:00:09.059> your<00:00:09.240> page<00:00:09.480> where

00:00:09.860 --> 00:00:09.870 
want to think about on your page where

00:00:09.870 --> 00:00:12.140 
want to think about on your page where
you<00:00:10.050> want<00:00:10.230> to<00:00:10.410> draw<00:00:10.650> your<00:00:10.830> butterfly<00:00:11.370> and

00:00:12.140 --> 00:00:12.150 
you want to draw your butterfly and

00:00:12.150 --> 00:00:13.549 
you want to draw your butterfly and
start<00:00:12.509> with<00:00:12.780> the<00:00:12.900> middle<00:00:13.200> part<00:00:13.440> of<00:00:13.500> your

00:00:13.549 --> 00:00:13.559 
start with the middle part of your

00:00:13.559 --> 00:00:17.170 
start with the middle part of your
butterfly<00:00:14.099> which<00:00:14.490> is<00:00:14.639> the<00:00:14.759> body<00:00:14.969> and<00:00:15.599> like<00:00:16.590> any

00:00:17.170 --> 00:00:17.180 
butterfly which is the body and like any

00:00:17.180 --> 00:00:20.090 
butterfly which is the body and like any
insect<00:00:18.180> it's<00:00:18.359> gonna<00:00:18.480> be<00:00:18.690> segmented<00:00:19.289> start

00:00:20.090 --> 00:00:20.100 
insect it's gonna be segmented start

00:00:20.100 --> 00:00:22.359 
insect it's gonna be segmented start
with<00:00:20.250> a<00:00:20.279> shape<00:00:20.550> gets<00:00:21.150> you<00:00:21.300> an<00:00:21.359> action<00:00:21.689> line<00:00:21.900> and

00:00:22.359 --> 00:00:22.369 
with a shape gets you an action line and

00:00:22.369 --> 00:00:25.429 
with a shape gets you an action line and
then<00:00:23.369> maybe<00:00:23.880> break<00:00:24.539> it<00:00:24.689> into<00:00:24.930> the<00:00:25.050> elements

00:00:25.429 --> 00:00:25.439 
then maybe break it into the elements

00:00:25.439 --> 00:00:28.689 
then maybe break it into the elements
like<00:00:25.590> the<00:00:25.769> head<00:00:26.010> the<00:00:26.970> upper<00:00:27.300> torso<00:00:27.570> and<00:00:28.199> the

00:00:28.689 --> 00:00:28.699 
like the head the upper torso and the

00:00:28.699 --> 00:00:34.069 
like the head the upper torso and the
lower<00:00:29.699> torso<00:00:30.439> draw<00:00:31.439> you<00:00:32.009> one<00:00:32.279> circle<00:00:32.899> for<00:00:33.899> your

00:00:34.069 --> 00:00:34.079 
lower torso draw you one circle for your

00:00:34.079 --> 00:00:37.040 
lower torso draw you one circle for your
upper<00:00:34.350> wing<00:00:35.059> another<00:00:36.059> circle<00:00:36.480> for<00:00:36.630> the<00:00:36.719> bottom

00:00:37.040 --> 00:00:37.050 
upper wing another circle for the bottom

00:00:37.050 --> 00:00:39.799 
upper wing another circle for the bottom
lean<00:00:37.309> circle<00:00:38.309> for<00:00:38.460> the<00:00:38.520> top<00:00:38.760> circle<00:00:39.570> for<00:00:39.719> the

00:00:39.799 --> 00:00:39.809 
lean circle for the top circle for the

00:00:39.809 --> 00:00:43.729 
lean circle for the top circle for the
bottom<00:00:40.309> okay<00:00:41.309> keep<00:00:41.820> it<00:00:41.940> simple<00:00:42.590> draw<00:00:43.590> your

00:00:43.729 --> 00:00:43.739 
bottom okay keep it simple draw your

00:00:43.739 --> 00:00:45.380 
bottom okay keep it simple draw your
construction<00:00:44.129> lines<00:00:44.250> very<00:00:44.670> lightly<00:00:44.940> so<00:00:45.149> you

00:00:45.380 --> 00:00:45.390 
construction lines very lightly so you

00:00:45.390 --> 00:00:49.819 
construction lines very lightly so you
can<00:00:45.660> come<00:00:45.870> back<00:00:46.079> and<00:00:47.989> erase<00:00:48.989> the<00:00:49.440> lines<00:00:49.649> you

00:00:49.819 --> 00:00:49.829 
can come back and erase the lines you

00:00:49.829 --> 00:00:51.529 
can come back and erase the lines you
don't<00:00:50.039> want<00:00:50.309> after<00:00:50.730> you<00:00:50.820> come<00:00:51.030> back<00:00:51.210> with<00:00:51.420> your

00:00:51.529 --> 00:00:51.539 
don't want after you come back with your

00:00:51.539 --> 00:00:55.670 
don't want after you come back with your
marker<00:00:51.980> okay<00:00:53.989> so<00:00:54.989> now<00:00:55.199> that<00:00:55.230> we<00:00:55.410> have<00:00:55.440> all<00:00:55.649> our

00:00:55.670 --> 00:00:55.680 
marker okay so now that we have all our

00:00:55.680 --> 00:00:58.880 
marker okay so now that we have all our
construction<00:00:56.370> elements<00:00:56.760> in<00:00:56.850> place<00:00:57.680> we<00:00:58.680> want

00:00:58.880 --> 00:00:58.890 
construction elements in place we want

00:00:58.890 --> 00:00:59.569 
construction elements in place we want
to<00:00:58.980> stop

00:00:59.569 --> 00:00:59.579 
to stop

00:00:59.579 --> 00:01:03.609 
to stop
it's<00:01:00.210> your<00:01:00.390> marker<00:01:00.780> and<00:01:01.350> come<00:01:01.620> back<00:01:01.829> and<00:01:02.070> just

00:01:03.609 --> 00:01:03.619 
it's your marker and come back and just

00:01:03.619 --> 00:01:14.950 
it's your marker and come back and just
outline<00:01:04.619> the<00:01:04.830> lines<00:01:05.460> you<00:01:05.790> want<00:01:06.000> to<00:01:06.150> keep<00:01:12.710> head

00:01:14.950 --> 00:01:14.960 
outline the lines you want to keep head

00:01:14.960 --> 00:01:18.420 
outline the lines you want to keep head
another<00:01:15.960> wing

00:01:18.420 --> 00:01:18.430 

00:01:18.430 --> 00:01:21.090 

now<00:01:19.090> you'll<00:01:19.300> need<00:01:19.480> to<00:01:19.570> look<00:01:19.750> at<00:01:19.930> the<00:01:20.100> picture

00:01:21.090 --> 00:01:21.100 
now you'll need to look at the picture

00:01:21.100 --> 00:01:23.310 
now you'll need to look at the picture
of<00:01:21.250> the<00:01:21.370> butterflies<00:01:21.910> specifically<00:01:22.870> that<00:01:23.140> you

00:01:23.310 --> 00:01:23.320 
of the butterflies specifically that you

00:01:23.320 --> 00:01:25.500 
of the butterflies specifically that you
want<00:01:23.530> to<00:01:23.650> draw<00:01:23.950> if<00:01:24.790> you<00:01:25.030> want<00:01:25.210> to<00:01:25.300> draw<00:01:25.480> a

00:01:25.500 --> 00:01:25.510 
want to draw if you want to draw a

00:01:25.510 --> 00:01:31.650 
want to draw if you want to draw a
specific<00:01:26.080> butterfly<00:01:29.940> and<00:01:30.940> that<00:01:31.330> way<00:01:31.480> you'll

00:01:31.650 --> 00:01:31.660 
specific butterfly and that way you'll

00:01:31.660 --> 00:01:33.420 
specific butterfly and that way you'll
get<00:01:31.780> the<00:01:31.840> wing<00:01:32.110> shapes<00:01:32.530> and<00:01:32.770> the<00:01:32.830> wing<00:01:32.980> marking

00:01:33.420 --> 00:01:33.430 
get the wing shapes and the wing marking

00:01:33.430 --> 00:01:35.820 
get the wing shapes and the wing marking
is<00:01:33.550> just<00:01:33.760> exactly<00:01:34.480> how<00:01:34.810> you<00:01:34.870> want<00:01:35.170> them<00:01:35.260> now

00:01:35.820 --> 00:01:35.830 
is just exactly how you want them now

00:01:35.830 --> 00:01:38.130 
is just exactly how you want them now
this<00:01:35.980> is<00:01:36.130> a<00:01:36.160> more<00:01:36.670> cartoony<00:01:37.420> sort<00:01:38.050> of

00:01:38.130 --> 00:01:38.140 
this is a more cartoony sort of

00:01:38.140 --> 00:01:40.530 
this is a more cartoony sort of
butterfly<00:01:38.560> but<00:01:38.770> all<00:01:38.890> the<00:01:39.040> elements<00:01:39.490> are<00:01:40.270> still

00:01:40.530 --> 00:01:40.540 
butterfly but all the elements are still

00:01:40.540 --> 00:01:41.330 
butterfly but all the elements are still
the<00:01:40.660> same

00:01:41.330 --> 00:01:41.340 
the same

00:01:41.340 --> 00:01:46.200 
the same
so<00:01:42.340> once<00:01:42.580> you<00:01:42.790> have<00:01:42.970> the<00:01:44.430> major<00:01:45.430> outline<00:01:46.000> in

00:01:46.200 --> 00:01:46.210 
so once you have the major outline in

00:01:46.210 --> 00:01:47.610 
so once you have the major outline in
place<00:01:46.450> you<00:01:46.630> can<00:01:46.780> come<00:01:46.990> back<00:01:47.170> and<00:01:47.380> if<00:01:47.470> you've

00:01:47.610 --> 00:01:47.620 
place you can come back and if you've

00:01:47.620 --> 00:01:50.370 
place you can come back and if you've
drawn<00:01:47.920> your<00:01:48.570> construction<00:01:49.570> lines<00:01:49.930> light

00:01:50.370 --> 00:01:50.380 
drawn your construction lines light

00:01:50.380 --> 00:01:53.340 
drawn your construction lines light
enough<00:01:51.300> very<00:01:52.300> easy<00:01:52.540> to<00:01:52.690> come<00:01:52.900> back<00:01:53.080> and<00:01:53.290> erase

00:01:53.340 --> 00:01:53.350 
enough very easy to come back and erase

00:01:53.350 --> 00:02:03.890 
enough very easy to come back and erase
the<00:01:53.680> lines<00:01:55.470> that<00:01:56.470> you<00:01:56.710> don't<00:01:56.890> want<00:01:57.250> anymore

00:02:03.890 --> 00:02:03.900 

00:02:03.900 --> 00:02:08.820 

so<00:02:04.900> there<00:02:05.170> you<00:02:05.200> have<00:02:05.440> like<00:02:06.070> a<00:02:06.100> basic<00:02:06.640> shape<00:02:07.830> now

00:02:08.820 --> 00:02:08.830 
so there you have like a basic shape now

00:02:08.830 --> 00:02:10.740 
so there you have like a basic shape now
you<00:02:08.890> can<00:02:09.130> come<00:02:09.369> back<00:02:09.580> and<00:02:09.970> especially<00:02:10.360> in<00:02:10.660> a

00:02:10.740 --> 00:02:10.750 
you can come back and especially in a

00:02:10.750 --> 00:02:13.949 
you can come back and especially in a
cartoon<00:02:11.140> if<00:02:11.350> you<00:02:11.470> wanted<00:02:11.770> to<00:02:11.890> make<00:02:12.070> a<00:02:12.959> cartoon

00:02:13.949 --> 00:02:13.959 
cartoon if you wanted to make a cartoon

00:02:13.959 --> 00:02:17.460 
cartoon if you wanted to make a cartoon
butterfly<00:02:15.390> you<00:02:16.390> could<00:02:16.600> give<00:02:16.780> it

00:02:17.460 --> 00:02:17.470 
butterfly you could give it

00:02:17.470 --> 00:02:23.699 
butterfly you could give it
maybe<00:02:17.740> a<00:02:17.890> big<00:02:18.670> old<00:02:19.030> grin<00:02:21.690> again<00:02:22.690> if<00:02:22.900> you<00:02:23.470> have<00:02:23.680> a

00:02:23.699 --> 00:02:23.709 
maybe a big old grin again if you have a

00:02:23.709 --> 00:02:25.650 
maybe a big old grin again if you have a
specific<00:02:24.070> butterfly<00:02:24.970> in<00:02:25.120> mind<00:02:25.390> you<00:02:25.630> should

00:02:25.650 --> 00:02:25.660 
specific butterfly in mind you should

00:02:25.660 --> 00:02:29.250 
specific butterfly in mind you should
look<00:02:25.989> at<00:02:26.140> the<00:02:26.260> picture<00:02:26.739> to<00:02:27.610> get<00:02:27.850> your<00:02:28.260> wing

00:02:29.250 --> 00:02:29.260 
look at the picture to get your wing

00:02:29.260 --> 00:02:34.410 
look at the picture to get your wing
decorations<00:02:31.560> and<00:02:32.560> you<00:02:32.709> can<00:02:32.860> color<00:02:33.100> it<00:02:33.420> instead

00:02:34.410 --> 00:02:34.420 
decorations and you can color it instead

00:02:34.420 --> 00:02:45.300 
decorations and you can color it instead
of<00:02:34.660> doing<00:02:35.050> a<00:02:35.110> pencil<00:02:36.120> down<00:02:37.120> like<00:02:37.390> I'm<00:02:37.570> doing
