00:01:30.120 --> 00:01:30.130 
see how much polish we can do to try to

00:01:30.130 --> 00:01:32.550 
see how much polish we can do to try to
bring<00:01:30.400> that<00:01:30.550> out<00:01:30.720> that's<00:01:31.720> the<00:01:31.930> original<00:01:32.350> color

00:01:32.550 --> 00:01:32.560

behind<00:01:32.830> with<00:01:33.070> stickers<00:01:33.400> and<00:01:34.290> not<00:01:35.290> going<00:01:35.410> to

00:01:35.460 --> 00:01:35.470 
behind with stickers and not going to

00:01:35.470 --> 00:01:36.990 
behind with stickers and not going to
get<00:01:35.560> it<00:01:35.680> close<00:01:35.890> to<00:01:35.920> that<00:01:36.280> but<00:01:36.460> you<00:01:36.640> might<00:01:36.820> be

00:01:36.990 --> 00:01:37.000 
get it close to that but you might be

00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:38.280 
get it close to that but you might be
able<00:01:37.090> to<00:01:37.150> get<00:01:37.330> it<00:01:37.450> a<00:01:37.510> little<00:01:37.690> bit<00:01:37.840> better<00:01:38.020> than

00:01:38.280 --> 00:01:38.290 
able to get it a little bit better than

00:01:38.290 --> 00:01:41.270 
able to get it a little bit better than
what<00:01:38.410> it<00:01:38.470> is

00:01:41.270 --> 00:01:41.280 

00:01:41.280 --> 00:01:44.880 

that's<00:01:42.280> after<00:01:42.670> one<00:01:42.880> cut<00:01:43.530> I've<00:01:44.530> brought<00:01:44.770> the

00:01:44.880 --> 00:01:44.890 
that's after one cut I've brought the

00:01:44.890 --> 00:01:46.590 
that's after one cut I've brought the
polish<00:01:45.280> back<00:01:45.490> but<00:01:45.850> you<00:01:45.940> can<00:01:46.060> still<00:01:46.300> see<00:01:46.479> the

00:01:46.590 --> 00:01:46.600 
polish back but you can still see the

00:01:46.600 --> 00:01:48.090 
polish back but you can still see the
paint<00:01:46.810> still<00:01:47.050> faded<00:01:47.380> you're<00:01:47.500> never<00:01:47.680> gonna<00:01:47.860> get

00:01:48.090 --> 00:01:48.100 
paint still faded you're never gonna get

00:01:48.100 --> 00:01:53.760 
paint still faded you're never gonna get
that<00:01:48.280> out<00:01:49.740> no<00:01:50.740> seams<00:01:50.979> the<00:01:51.130> sides<00:01:52.380> I'm<00:01:53.380> gonna<00:01:53.590> do

00:01:53.760 --> 00:01:53.770 
that out no seams the sides I'm gonna do

00:01:53.770 --> 00:01:57.480 
that out no seams the sides I'm gonna do
the<00:01:53.920> color<00:01:54.190> I<00:01:54.490> mean<00:01:55.270> I<00:01:55.330> could<00:01:55.479> probably<00:01:56.490> get

00:01:57.480 --> 00:01:57.490 
the color I mean I could probably get

00:01:57.490 --> 00:01:59.460 
the color I mean I could probably get
that<00:01:57.640> whiteness<00:01:58.150> out<00:01:58.390> what<00:01:58.869> the<00:01:59.020> rest<00:01:59.200> of<00:01:59.320> it

00:01:59.460 --> 00:01:59.470 
that whiteness out what the rest of it

00:01:59.470 --> 00:02:00.960 
that whiteness out what the rest of it
will<00:01:59.650> still<00:01:59.890> be<00:02:00.070> faded<00:02:00.640> that's<00:02:00.820> what<00:02:00.910> I'm

00:02:00.960 --> 00:02:00.970 
will still be faded that's what I'm

00:02:00.970 --> 00:02:04.010 
will still be faded that's what I'm
gonna<00:02:01.090> deckle<00:02:01.630> it

00:02:04.010 --> 00:02:04.020 

00:02:04.020 --> 00:02:06.780 

all<00:02:05.020> right<00:02:05.229> seal<00:02:05.470> faded<00:02:05.979> it<00:02:06.130> is<00:02:06.250> on<00:02:06.430> this<00:02:06.580> side

00:02:06.780 --> 00:02:06.790

00:02:13.860 --> 00:02:13.870 
let's see if we can polish it up all
