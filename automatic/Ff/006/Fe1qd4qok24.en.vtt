 hello hello that such welcome to the channel 

00:00:02.660 --> 00:00:06.879
 crafts step by step and in this 

00:00:04.490 --> 00:00:09.800
 occasion we will make some beautiful masks 

00:00:06.879 --> 00:00:12.200
 I take this opportunity we are going to make a 

00:00:09.800 --> 00:00:14.150
 Chick mask and other ostrich mask 

00:00:12.200 --> 00:00:17.179
 although it is true that in the stationery 

00:00:14.150 --> 00:00:19.279
 it is very easy to find the masks already 

00:00:17.179 --> 00:00:21.529
 made always take another reason 

00:00:19.279 --> 00:00:24.019
 special when you make them yourself 

00:00:21.529 --> 00:00:26.089
 let's start with step number 1 

00:00:24.019 --> 00:00:29.749
 you can first help with a sheet 

00:00:26.089 --> 00:00:32.360
 letter size to go doing the form 

00:00:29.749 --> 00:00:34.910
 from the face of the girl or boy to whom 

00:00:32.360 --> 00:00:37.730
 you are going to make the mask you are going to guide 

00:00:34.910 --> 00:00:40.310
 measuring the orejita orejita and 

00:00:37.730 --> 00:00:42.860
 marking what are your eyes or nose and 

00:00:40.310 --> 00:00:45.020
 your mouth will cut it and once you have 

00:00:42.860 --> 00:00:47.570
 have this mold made of the leaf what 

00:00:45.020 --> 00:00:51.500
 you can move on to what is foam and what 

00:00:47.570 --> 00:00:53.300
 copies and you cut it step number 2 with the 

00:00:51.500 --> 00:00:56.210
 help from a pen you are going to make 

00:00:53.300 --> 00:00:58.400
 small holes at the ends of the 

00:00:56.210 --> 00:01:01.040
 ear so you can put there the 

00:00:58.400 --> 00:01:03.079
 spring helps to have a spring that 

00:01:01.040 --> 00:01:05.000
 it looks like thread so you do not put the 

00:01:03.079 --> 00:01:06.890
 thick spring and look ugly 

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:09.770
 once you have facts 

00:01:06.890 --> 00:01:13.010
 step let's move on to step number 3 with 

00:01:09.770 --> 00:01:14.600
 the help of the cold silicone will go 

00:01:13.010 --> 00:01:18.290
 hitting around the contour of the 

00:01:14.600 --> 00:01:20.570
 feather tippet mask 

00:01:18.290 --> 00:01:23.570
 chicken is going to keep hitting everything 

00:01:20.570 --> 00:01:27.320
 around and then you will fill what is 

00:01:23.570 --> 00:01:29.600
 all the mask of the center as step 

00:01:27.320 --> 00:01:32.119
 final nothing else you have to hit a 

00:01:29.600 --> 00:01:35.750
 nose and it's going to be done from a 

00:01:32.119 --> 00:01:37.670
 cone made of foami orange and that's the 

00:01:35.750 --> 00:01:39.770
 completion of our mask 

00:01:37.670 --> 00:01:42.530
 chick now let's start with 

00:01:39.770 --> 00:01:45.170
 our ostrich mask the mold is 

00:01:42.530 --> 00:01:46.850
 what you see in the photograph are you going to 

00:01:45.170 --> 00:01:49.640
 make that size and in the end 

00:01:46.850 --> 00:01:51.860
 we will cut the top part so that 

00:01:49.640 --> 00:01:54.289
 we look nice again 

00:01:51.860 --> 00:01:57.789
 you will base the mold on paper first and 

00:01:54.289 --> 00:01:57.789
 then you will pass it to fomy 

00:01:58.330 --> 00:02:03.400
 let's start with the mask of the 

00:02:00.910 --> 00:02:06.310
 ostrich is now again the mold in 

00:02:03.400 --> 00:02:07.960
 a sheet size letter and cut well 

00:02:06.310 --> 00:02:10.930
 equally what are the eyes the nose 

00:02:07.960 --> 00:02:15.880
 and the mouth move to that shape and cut us 

00:02:10.930 --> 00:02:18.160
 step number 2 is to make two figures of 

00:02:15.880 --> 00:02:19.930
 orange foami like the ones you see in 

00:02:18.160 --> 00:02:23.290
 photography to do what is the 

00:02:19.930 --> 00:02:26.280
 beak of the ostrich cut ace of the part 

00:02:23.290 --> 00:02:28.120
 from below like some cuts 

00:02:26.280 --> 00:02:30.190
 approximately half a centimeter 

00:02:28.120 --> 00:02:33.610
 up so you can 

00:02:30.190 --> 00:02:36.220
 paste well and stick it from what it is 

00:02:33.610 --> 00:02:38.620
 the nose to the bottom part also of 

00:02:36.220 --> 00:02:40.630
 the mouth to the ends cut as two 

00:02:38.620 --> 00:02:43.660
 triangles that you will also cut them 

00:02:40.630 --> 00:02:47.020
 in the bottom part and paste up as 

00:02:43.660 --> 00:02:51.100
 is there in the picture step number 2 is 

00:02:47.020 --> 00:02:53.080
 cut into two small circles of 

00:02:51.100 --> 00:02:55.180
 black foami and put them in the part of 

00:02:53.080 --> 00:02:57.610
 up your nose and it's to simulate 

00:02:55.180 --> 00:03:00.220
 what is the nose and with a colored down 

00:02:57.610 --> 00:03:02.000
 black you're going to mark the ends of the 

00:03:00.220 --> 00:03:06.050
 triangles what is the 

00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:10.880
 the mouth of this beast as step number 

00:03:06.050 --> 00:03:13.880
 next you are going to put what are feathers 

00:03:10.880 --> 00:03:16.880
 of white color and you will place them in 

00:03:13.880 --> 00:03:18.920
 just above the eye to simulate what 

00:03:16.880 --> 00:03:23.000
 are his eyebrows and also in the part of 

00:03:18.920 --> 00:03:26.330
 here down your neck after you will try 

00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:28.220
 to cut more or less from where it is 

00:03:26.330 --> 00:03:31.190
 the eye as up you're going to mark 

00:03:28.220 --> 00:03:34.100
 about two centimeters and you're going to cut to 

00:03:31.190 --> 00:03:36.410
 simulate the front of the ostrich also 

00:03:34.100 --> 00:03:39.350
 cut ace around what your 

00:03:36.410 --> 00:03:42.000
 cheeks so that finally the 

00:03:39.350 --> 00:03:44.910
 well- outlined mask 

00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:46.800
 the end that will come out of the fomin will be 

00:03:44.910 --> 00:03:50.010
 more or less like this will remain as a 

00:03:46.800 --> 00:03:52.200
 helmet of what you are going to remove because this 

00:03:50.010 --> 00:03:55.200
 is the completion of the masks if you
