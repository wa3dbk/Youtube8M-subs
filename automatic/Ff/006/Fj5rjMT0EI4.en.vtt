00:01:11.280 --> 00:01:14.120
 the two were left city called with themes 

00:01:14.120 --> 00:01:17.250

00:01:17.250 --> 00:01:17.979

 the same name menchú network in the common folder on the active 

00:01:23.370 --> 00:01:26.370
 is going to have four drawings here 

00:01:28.010 --> 00:01:29.660
 they are the prizes 

00:01:29.660 --> 00:01:32.540
 min 

00:01:32.540 --> 00:01:35.540
 the issues and why the monumental goal avoided 

00:01:37.200 --> 00:01:39.100
 It was the first order 

00:01:39.100 --> 00:01:42.560
 As you can see they are very good 

00:01:42.560 --> 00:01:44.390
 mika hakkinen 

00:01:44.390 --> 00:01:47.070
 in this mess that just at the time 

00:01:47.070 --> 00:01:48.090
 and good 

00:01:48.090 --> 00:01:50.130
 min also the date 

00:01:50.130 --> 00:01:53.230
 the one that is very very very good this 

00:01:53.230 --> 00:01:54.780
 on this issue 

00:01:54.780 --> 00:01:57.820
 I like it a lot, usually 

00:01:57.820 --> 00:01:59.600
 in the northeast 

00:01:59.600 --> 00:02:01.530
 It's very good, let's see 

00:02:01.530 --> 00:02:04.530
 as is the lion's part of the navigation menu 

00:02:05.510 --> 00:02:08.599
 well this is the navigation in it 

00:02:08.599 --> 00:02:12.720
 as you can see also all the icons something that does not change is the store ovi 

00:02:12.719 --> 00:02:14.299
 store 

00:02:14.299 --> 00:02:17.299
 that is a boy not that brings by default here our 

00:02:19.119 --> 00:02:21.399
 our homo videns 

00:02:21.399 --> 00:02:23.559
 so we have to worry about that 

00:02:23.559 --> 00:02:24.829
 but all 

00:02:24.829 --> 00:02:28.029
 the icons change and - t 

00:02:28.029 --> 00:02:31.029
 that moves us and I like it very much 

00:02:31.029 --> 00:02:32.809
 well this is a subject 

00:02:32.809 --> 00:02:35.809
 very elegant 

00:02:36.589 --> 00:02:39.939
 has what would be the first semester a car 

00:02:39.939 --> 00:02:42.289
 in boiro as an effect 

00:02:42.289 --> 00:02:44.859
 fire 

00:02:44.859 --> 00:02:47.019
 blue 

00:02:47.019 --> 00:02:51.109
 and that kind of thing we carry everything that is the navigation menu 

00:02:53.139 --> 00:02:56.029
 well this is no longer new navigation 

00:02:56.029 --> 00:02:57.329
 i 

00:02:57.329 --> 00:02:58.509
 as you can see 

00:02:58.509 --> 00:03:01.519
 it is very very good to warm the icons 

00:03:03.649 --> 00:03:05.109
 the picture 

00:03:05.109 --> 00:03:06.949
 the fund we want 

00:03:06.949 --> 00:03:09.579
 in the last image 

00:03:09.579 --> 00:03:12.309
 he stayed in the upper part of the world 

00:03:12.309 --> 00:03:14.629
 of that subject a good topic does not 

00:03:14.629 --> 00:03:18.069
 an excellent theme for our Nokia 70 

00:03:18.739 --> 00:03:22.199
 and brings the attack back to life 

00:03:22.199 --> 00:03:25.419
 it may be that on a larger scale the two that more points east 

00:03:26.169 --> 00:03:28.589
 in ee 

00:03:28.589 --> 00:03:30.829
 what I see them believing 

00:03:30.829 --> 00:03:33.829
 balfour and the three the mate rupérez 

00:03:34.799 --> 00:03:36.879
 so good 

00:03:36.879 --> 00:03:39.749
 I hope that the use of this one 

00:03:39.749 --> 00:03:41.579
 this militant theme 

00:03:41.579 --> 00:03:44.599
 without first reminding them that 

00:03:44.599 --> 00:03:46.859
 If they want 

00:03:46.859 --> 00:03:50.989
 I already can go for another mobile phone I can get them with pleasure 

00:03:50.989 --> 00:03:52.900
 i if they want 

00:03:52.900 --> 00:03:53.850
 benefits 

00:03:53.850 --> 00:03:58.040
 for what you are exposed to another mobile also be little follow do not hesitate 

00:03:58.040 --> 00:04:00.830
 look for redskins for a greeting and see you next time
