00:00:12.230 --> 00:00:12.240 
got an average of 12 and this is the

00:00:12.240 --> 00:00:14.089 
got an average of 12 and this is the
fastest<00:00:12.719> average<00:00:13.080> of<00:00:13.230> 12<00:00:13.469> that<00:00:13.830> I've<00:00:13.980> ever

00:00:14.089 --> 00:00:14.099 
fastest average of 12 that I've ever

00:00:14.099 --> 00:00:15.530 
fastest average of 12 that I've ever

00:00:17.480 --> 00:00:17.490 
about it and I for where I am with

00:00:17.490 --> 00:00:19.189 
about it and I for where I am with
cubing<00:00:17.910> I<00:00:18.029> think<00:00:18.240> I<00:00:18.330> had<00:00:18.420> a<00:00:18.449> really<00:00:18.810> good<00:00:18.930> day

00:00:19.189 --> 00:00:19.199 
cubing I think I had a really good day

00:00:19.199 --> 00:00:22.189 
cubing I think I had a really good day
with<00:00:19.740> my<00:00:20.010> solves<00:00:20.490> I<00:00:20.670> just<00:00:21.449> started<00:00:21.779> solving

00:00:22.189 --> 00:00:22.199 
with my solves I just started solving

00:00:22.199 --> 00:00:24.620 
with my solves I just started solving
and<00:00:22.350> I<00:00:22.380> was<00:00:22.500> getting<00:00:22.769> really<00:00:23.279> fast<00:00:23.490> x<00:00:23.789> 13<00:00:24.330> and

00:00:24.620 --> 00:00:24.630 
and I was getting really fast x 13 and

00:00:24.630 --> 00:00:26.750 
and I was getting really fast x 13 and
14<00:00:24.840> I<00:00:25.380> decided<00:00:25.890> to<00:00:26.039> turn<00:00:26.160> on<00:00:26.310> the<00:00:26.400> camera<00:00:26.699> I

00:00:26.750 --> 00:00:26.760 
14 I decided to turn on the camera I

00:00:26.760 --> 00:00:28.189 
14 I decided to turn on the camera I
didn't<00:00:27.000> capture<00:00:27.150> any<00:00:27.480> of<00:00:27.539> those<00:00:27.660> but<00:00:27.930> I<00:00:27.960> did

00:00:28.189 --> 00:00:28.199 
didn't capture any of those but I did

00:00:28.199 --> 00:00:29.810 
didn't capture any of those but I did
get<00:00:28.320> a<00:00:28.380> really<00:00:28.680> fast<00:00:28.859> average<00:00:29.340> which<00:00:29.550> you're

00:00:29.810 --> 00:00:29.820 
get a really fast average which you're

00:00:29.820 --> 00:00:31.370 
get a really fast average which you're
seeing<00:00:30.060> right<00:00:30.210> now<00:00:30.240> and<00:00:30.630> then<00:00:30.960> after<00:00:31.199> that<00:00:31.320> I

00:00:31.370 --> 00:00:31.380 
seeing right now and then after that I

00:00:31.380 --> 00:00:33.590 
seeing right now and then after that I
even<00:00:31.619> got<00:00:31.769> a<00:00:31.830> faster<00:00:32.369> one<00:00:32.520> which<00:00:33.360> I'll<00:00:33.480> be

00:00:33.590 --> 00:00:33.600 
even got a faster one which I'll be

00:00:33.600 --> 00:00:35.810 
even got a faster one which I'll be
uploading<00:00:33.960> at<00:00:34.050> a<00:00:34.079> later<00:00:34.320> date<00:00:34.590> so<00:00:34.829> I<00:00:35.579> want<00:00:35.790> to

00:00:50.360 --> 00:00:50.370 
speed solving and I personally really

00:00:50.370 --> 00:00:52.100 
speed solving and I personally really
like<00:00:50.520> it<00:00:50.760> because<00:00:50.910> of<00:00:50.940> the<00:00:51.120> large<00:00:51.390> display<00:00:51.899> but

be really quickly aware of with this

00:01:09.119 --> 00:01:10.850 
be really quickly aware of with this
program<00:01:09.540> is<00:01:09.720> that<00:01:09.750> it's<00:01:09.960> internet-based<00:01:10.380> you

00:01:10.850 --> 00:01:10.860 
program is that it's internet-based you

00:01:10.860 --> 00:01:13.429 
program is that it's internet-based you
cannot<00:01:11.369> open<00:01:12.150> it<00:01:12.240> unless<00:01:12.689> you're<00:01:12.930> you<00:01:13.409> know

cannot open it unless you're you know
connected<00:01:14.130> to<00:01:14.220> the<00:01:14.310> Internet<00:01:14.640> what<00:01:14.970> you<00:01:15.119> can

00:01:15.350 --> 00:01:15.360 
connected to the Internet what you can

00:01:15.360 --> 00:01:16.520 
connected to the Internet what you can
do<00:01:15.540> though<00:01:15.720> is<00:01:15.840> you<00:01:15.900> can<00:01:16.110> connect<00:01:16.409> to<00:01:16.500> the

do though is you can connect to the

00:01:16.530 --> 00:01:18.440 
do though is you can connect to the
internet<00:01:16.619> then<00:01:17.100> you<00:01:17.250> can<00:01:17.400> open<00:01:17.610> it<00:01:17.880> into<00:01:18.119> a<00:01:18.150> tab

00:01:18.450 --> 00:01:20.149 
internet then you can open it into a tab
and<00:01:18.689> then<00:01:18.900> you<00:01:19.020> can<00:01:19.200> bring<00:01:19.350> a<00:01:19.470> computer<00:01:19.770> away

00:01:20.149 --> 00:01:20.159 
and then you can bring a computer away

00:01:20.159 --> 00:01:23.240 
and then you can bring a computer away
from<00:01:20.460> the<00:01:21.290> internet<00:01:22.290> source<00:01:22.619> so<00:01:23.130> you're

00:01:23.240 --> 00:01:23.250 
from the internet source so you're

00:01:23.250 --> 00:01:25.999 
from the internet source so you're
offline<00:01:23.700> and<00:01:24.030> still<00:01:24.299> use<00:01:24.750> it<00:01:24.930> the<00:01:25.439> program<00:01:25.830> is

00:01:25.999 --> 00:01:26.009 
offline and still use it the program is

00:01:26.009 --> 00:01:27.859 
offline and still use it the program is
open<00:01:26.159> it's<00:01:26.520> available<00:01:26.909> for<00:01:27.360> you<00:01:27.509> so<00:01:27.540> that's

00:01:27.859 --> 00:01:27.869 
open it's available for you so that's

00:01:27.869 --> 00:01:28.999 
open it's available for you so that's
one<00:01:28.080> thing<00:01:28.200> you<00:01:28.290> want<00:01:28.470> to<00:01:28.530> do<00:01:28.680> if<00:01:28.860> you're

00:01:28.999 --> 00:01:29.009 
one thing you want to do if you're

00:01:29.009 --> 00:01:31.280 
one thing you want to do if you're

carrying your laptop around just open it

00:01:31.290 --> 00:01:33.319 
carrying your laptop around just open it
in<00:01:31.409> a<00:01:31.470> tab<00:01:31.710> and<00:01:31.890> keep<00:01:32.009> a<00:01:32.130> tab<00:01:32.310> open<00:01:32.490> anyway<00:01:33.270> so

00:01:33.319 --> 00:01:33.329 
in a tab and keep a tab open anyway so

00:01:33.329 --> 00:01:34.460 
in a tab and keep a tab open anyway so
there<00:01:33.600> you<00:01:33.720> go<00:01:33.900> the<00:01:34.079> link<00:01:34.229> is<00:01:34.350> in<00:01:34.380> the

there you go the link is in the

00:01:34.470 --> 00:01:36.620 
there you go the link is in the

description for you guys so I want to

00:01:36.630 --> 00:01:39.710 
description for you guys so I want to
talk<00:01:36.780> about<00:01:36.900> my<00:01:37.140> progress<00:01:37.439> with<00:01:37.860> 3x3<00:01:38.549> and<00:01:38.850> I'm

00:01:39.710 --> 00:01:39.720 
talk about my progress with 3x3 and I'm

00:01:39.720 --> 00:01:42.050 
talk about my progress with 3x3 and I'm
getting<00:01:40.200> faster<00:01:40.530> at<00:01:40.860> a<00:01:40.920> slow<00:01:41.250> pace<00:01:41.280> and<00:01:41.670> a<00:01:41.939> lot

00:01:42.050 --> 00:01:42.060 
getting faster at a slow pace and a lot

00:01:42.060 --> 00:01:43.730 
getting faster at a slow pace and a lot
of<00:01:42.090> people<00:01:42.420> I<00:01:42.509> see<00:01:42.720> get<00:01:42.899> faster<00:01:43.320> at<00:01:43.470> a<00:01:43.500> fast

00:01:43.730 --> 00:01:43.740 
of people I see get faster at a fast

00:01:43.740 --> 00:01:45.770 
of people I see get faster at a fast
pace<00:01:43.890> and<00:01:44.579> I'm<00:01:44.970> wondering<00:01:45.329> why<00:01:45.540> is<00:01:45.600> that

00:01:45.770 --> 00:01:45.780 
pace and I'm wondering why is that

00:01:45.780 --> 00:01:48.139 
pace and I'm wondering why is that
alaikum<00:01:46.439> I<00:01:46.560> just<00:01:46.829> you<00:01:47.310> know<00:01:47.340> is<00:01:47.610> the<00:01:47.970> newer

00:01:48.139 --> 00:01:48.149 
alaikum I just you know is the newer

00:01:48.149 --> 00:01:50.030 
alaikum I just you know is the newer
generation<00:01:48.810> that<00:01:48.960> is<00:01:49.110> younger<00:01:49.380> than<00:01:49.590> me<00:01:49.770> just

00:01:50.030 --> 00:01:50.040 
generation that is younger than me just

00:01:50.040 --> 00:01:52.850 
generation that is younger than me just
a<00:01:50.220> lot<00:01:50.399> smarter<00:01:50.729> huh<00:01:51.149> or<00:01:51.450> like<00:01:52.110> or<00:01:52.649> am<00:01:52.770> I<00:01:52.829> just

00:01:52.850 --> 00:01:52.860 
a lot smarter huh or like or am I just

00:01:52.860 --> 00:01:54.980 
a lot smarter huh or like or am I just
not<00:01:53.189> doing<00:01:53.520> something<00:01:53.790> right<00:01:53.970> you<00:01:54.659> know<00:01:54.780> in

00:01:54.980 --> 00:01:54.990 
not doing something right you know in

00:01:54.990 --> 00:01:56.749 
not doing something right you know in
its<00:01:55.320> I<00:01:55.530> don't<00:01:55.799> think<00:01:56.100> it's<00:01:56.250> either<00:01:56.430> those<00:01:56.729> I

00:01:56.749 --> 00:01:56.759 
its I don't think it's either those I

00:01:56.759 --> 00:01:58.340 
its I don't think it's either those I
think<00:01:57.090> what<00:01:57.240> it<00:01:57.360> is<00:01:57.390> is<00:01:57.719> that<00:01:57.750> I<00:01:57.930> just<00:01:58.170> don't

00:01:58.340 --> 00:01:58.350 
think what it is is that I just don't

00:01:58.350 --> 00:02:00.440 
think what it is is that I just don't
practice<00:01:58.799> very<00:01:59.009> much<00:01:59.189> I'm<00:01:59.399> kind<00:01:59.909> of<00:01:59.939> lazy<00:02:00.119> with

00:02:00.440 --> 00:02:00.450 
practice very much I'm kind of lazy with

00:02:00.450 --> 00:02:04.459 
practice very much I'm kind of lazy with
it<00:02:00.479> and<00:02:00.840> I<00:02:02.090> mean<00:02:03.090> like<00:02:03.270> everybody's<00:02:04.079> asking<00:02:04.229> me

00:02:04.459 --> 00:02:04.469 
it and I mean like everybody's asking me

00:02:04.469 --> 00:02:06.679 
it and I mean like everybody's asking me
for<00:02:04.560> oh<00:02:04.799> ll<00:02:05.159> tutorials<00:02:05.820> because<00:02:06.180> they<00:02:06.329> see<00:02:06.390> me

00:02:06.679 --> 00:02:06.689 
for oh ll tutorials because they see me

00:02:06.689 --> 00:02:09.440 
for oh ll tutorials because they see me
using<00:02:07.110> full<00:02:07.320> o<00:02:07.350> ll<00:02:07.829> and<00:02:08.129> I<00:02:08.399> don't<00:02:08.670> use<00:02:08.940> full<00:02:09.270> o

00:02:09.440 --> 00:02:09.450 
using full o ll and I don't use full o

00:02:09.450 --> 00:02:10.010 
using full o ll and I don't use full o
ll

00:02:10.010 --> 00:02:10.020 
ll

00:02:10.020 --> 00:02:12.229 
ll
but<00:02:10.140> I<00:02:10.170> do<00:02:10.289> know<00:02:10.770> more<00:02:11.280> than<00:02:11.520> half<00:02:11.700> of<00:02:11.910> them<00:02:12.060> so

00:02:12.229 --> 00:02:12.239 
but I do know more than half of them so

00:02:12.239 --> 00:02:13.280 
but I do know more than half of them so
a<00:02:12.270> lot<00:02:12.510> of<00:02:12.540> the<00:02:12.629> time

00:02:13.280 --> 00:02:13.290 
a lot of the time

00:02:13.290 --> 00:02:15.170 
a lot of the time
looks<00:02:13.530> like<00:02:13.709> I<00:02:13.860> do<00:02:13.920> know<00:02:14.280> it<00:02:14.430> but<00:02:14.579> I<00:02:14.610> don't<00:02:15.150> I

00:02:15.170 --> 00:02:15.180 
looks like I do know it but I don't I

00:02:15.180 --> 00:02:17.869 
looks like I do know it but I don't I
still<00:02:15.780> use<00:02:15.810> to<00:02:16.230> look<00:02:16.439> unless<00:02:16.680> I<00:02:17.219> don't<00:02:17.280> have<00:02:17.640> to

00:02:17.869 --> 00:02:17.879 
still use to look unless I don't have to

00:02:17.879 --> 00:02:21.979 
still use to look unless I don't have to
I<00:02:18.090> do<00:02:18.480> use<00:02:18.930> full<00:02:19.409> PLL<00:02:20.209> and<00:02:21.209> I<00:02:21.510> know<00:02:21.569> more<00:02:21.870> than

00:02:21.979 --> 00:02:21.989 
I do use full PLL and I know more than

00:02:21.989 --> 00:02:24.050 
I do use full PLL and I know more than
one<00:02:22.170> algorithm<00:02:22.439> for<00:02:22.769> the<00:02:22.829> PLL's<00:02:23.250> for<00:02:23.790> some<00:02:23.939> of

00:02:24.050 --> 00:02:24.060 
one algorithm for the PLL's for some of

00:02:24.060 --> 00:02:25.729 
one algorithm for the PLL's for some of
them<00:02:24.150> too<00:02:24.329> so<00:02:24.569> it<00:02:24.659> depends<00:02:24.930> on<00:02:24.989> what<00:02:25.109> what

00:02:25.729 --> 00:02:25.739 
them too so it depends on what what

00:02:25.739 --> 00:02:27.530 
them too so it depends on what what
angle<00:02:26.099> I<00:02:26.189> get<00:02:26.430> for<00:02:26.700> each<00:02:26.819> case<00:02:27.090> you<00:02:27.120> know<00:02:27.299> I<00:02:27.329> can

00:02:27.530 --> 00:02:27.540 
angle I get for each case you know I can

00:02:27.540 --> 00:02:29.929 
angle I get for each case you know I can
switch<00:02:28.109> an<00:02:28.230> algorithm<00:02:28.590> to<00:02:28.620> minimize<00:02:29.219> cube

00:02:29.929 --> 00:02:29.939 
switch an algorithm to minimize cube

00:02:29.939 --> 00:02:33.410 
switch an algorithm to minimize cube
rotations<00:02:30.480> and<00:02:30.689> things<00:02:30.840> like<00:02:30.989> that<00:02:31.049> so<00:02:32.030> hey<00:02:33.030> I

00:02:33.410 --> 00:02:33.420 
rotations and things like that so hey I

00:02:33.420 --> 00:02:34.580 
rotations and things like that so hey I
don't<00:02:33.629> know<00:02:33.750> I<00:02:33.810> kind<00:02:34.019> of<00:02:34.049> started<00:02:34.290> thinking

00:02:34.580 --> 00:02:34.590 
don't know I kind of started thinking

00:02:34.590 --> 00:02:36.199 
don't know I kind of started thinking
like<00:02:34.620> how<00:02:34.859> do<00:02:34.920> I<00:02:35.040> get<00:02:35.129> faster<00:02:35.640> at<00:02:35.730> a<00:02:35.790> faster

00:02:36.199 --> 00:02:36.209 
like how do I get faster at a faster

00:02:36.209 --> 00:02:38.750 
like how do I get faster at a faster
rate<00:02:36.239> then<00:02:36.629> it's<00:02:37.379> it's<00:02:37.709> not<00:02:37.920> only<00:02:38.280> just

00:02:38.750 --> 00:02:38.760 
rate then it's it's not only just

00:02:38.760 --> 00:02:40.490 
rate then it's it's not only just
practice<00:02:39.480> because<00:02:39.750> a<00:02:39.780> lot<00:02:39.930> of<00:02:39.959> people<00:02:40.079> say<00:02:40.349> how

00:02:40.490 --> 00:02:40.500 
practice because a lot of people say how

00:02:40.500 --> 00:02:42.050 
practice because a lot of people say how
do<00:02:40.560> I<00:02:40.650> get<00:02:40.739> faster<00:02:41.220> please<00:02:41.489> don't<00:02:41.730> tell<00:02:41.939> me

00:02:42.050 --> 00:02:42.060 
do I get faster please don't tell me

00:02:42.060 --> 00:02:44.240 
do I get faster please don't tell me
it's<00:02:42.209> only<00:02:42.329> practice<00:02:42.629> well<00:02:43.379> it<00:02:43.530> sort<00:02:43.769> of<00:02:43.920> isn't

00:02:44.240 --> 00:02:44.250 
it's only practice well it sort of isn't

00:02:44.250 --> 00:02:46.160 
it's only practice well it sort of isn't
it<00:02:44.340> sort<00:02:44.549> of<00:02:44.670> isn't<00:02:44.790> I<00:02:45.000> mean<00:02:45.150> you<00:02:45.750> can't<00:02:46.019> get

00:02:46.160 --> 00:02:46.170 
it sort of isn't I mean you can't get

00:02:46.170 --> 00:02:47.690 
it sort of isn't I mean you can't get
faster<00:02:46.620> unless<00:02:46.769> you<00:02:46.920> practice<00:02:47.129> that's<00:02:47.489> for

00:02:47.690 --> 00:02:47.700 
faster unless you practice that's for

00:02:47.700 --> 00:02:49.309 
faster unless you practice that's for
sure<00:02:47.909> but<00:02:48.150> you<00:02:48.239> have<00:02:48.359> to<00:02:48.480> be<00:02:48.569> aware<00:02:48.900> of<00:02:48.959> where

00:02:49.309 --> 00:02:49.319 
sure but you have to be aware of where

00:02:49.319 --> 00:02:50.839 
sure but you have to be aware of where
your<00:02:49.500> faults<00:02:49.829> are<00:02:50.010> and<00:02:50.370> you<00:02:50.430> have<00:02:50.459> to<00:02:50.639> practice

00:02:50.839 --> 00:02:50.849 
your faults are and you have to practice

00:02:50.849 --> 00:02:53.179 
your faults are and you have to practice
those<00:02:51.419> that's<00:02:52.200> the<00:02:52.379> thing<00:02:52.590> you<00:02:52.739> can't<00:02:52.799> just

00:02:53.179 --> 00:02:53.189 
those that's the thing you can't just

00:02:53.189 --> 00:02:54.470 
those that's the thing you can't just
practice<00:02:53.549> the<00:02:53.669> same<00:02:53.879> thing<00:02:54.060> over<00:02:54.209> and<00:02:54.359> over

00:02:54.470 --> 00:02:54.480 
practice the same thing over and over

00:02:54.480 --> 00:02:56.509 
practice the same thing over and over
and<00:02:54.629> over<00:02:54.750> and<00:02:54.930> over<00:02:54.989> again<00:02:55.200> and<00:02:55.650> not<00:02:56.310> learn

00:02:56.509 --> 00:02:56.519 
and over and over again and not learn

00:02:56.519 --> 00:02:58.099 
and over and over again and not learn
anything<00:02:56.819> new<00:02:56.939> and<00:02:57.180> expect<00:02:57.629> to<00:02:57.750> just<00:02:57.959> get

00:02:58.099 --> 00:02:58.109 
anything new and expect to just get

00:02:58.109 --> 00:03:00.679 
anything new and expect to just get
super<00:02:58.290> fast<00:02:58.879> you<00:02:59.879> have<00:03:00.000> to<00:03:00.060> learn<00:03:00.419> different

00:03:00.679 --> 00:03:00.689 
super fast you have to learn different

00:03:00.689 --> 00:03:03.140 
super fast you have to learn different
f2l<00:03:01.530> stuff<00:03:01.829> and<00:03:02.040> I<00:03:02.280> got<00:03:02.639> to<00:03:02.730> be<00:03:02.819> honest<00:03:03.090> I

00:03:03.140 --> 00:03:03.150 
f2l stuff and I got to be honest I

00:03:03.150 --> 00:03:05.030 
f2l stuff and I got to be honest I
haven't<00:03:03.419> really<00:03:03.750> refined<00:03:04.169> my<00:03:04.379> f2l<00:03:04.799> and

00:03:05.030 --> 00:03:05.040 
haven't really refined my f2l and

00:03:05.040 --> 00:03:07.610 
haven't really refined my f2l and
exhaust<00:03:05.639> old<00:03:06.419> me<00:03:06.510> the<00:03:06.629> other<00:03:06.750> day<00:03:06.930> you<00:03:07.560> know

00:03:07.610 --> 00:03:07.620 
exhaust old me the other day you know

00:03:07.620 --> 00:03:09.920 
exhaust old me the other day you know
like<00:03:07.859> where<00:03:08.669> you're<00:03:08.849> at<00:03:09.060> is<00:03:09.239> the<00:03:09.359> perfect<00:03:09.750> time

00:03:09.920 --> 00:03:09.930 
like where you're at is the perfect time

00:03:09.930 --> 00:03:12.500 
like where you're at is the perfect time
to<00:03:09.959> reinvent<00:03:10.709> your<00:03:11.010> f2l<00:03:11.459> and<00:03:12.030> he<00:03:12.120> linked<00:03:12.389> me<00:03:12.480> to

00:03:12.500 --> 00:03:12.510 
to reinvent your f2l and he linked me to

00:03:12.510 --> 00:03:14.119 
to reinvent your f2l and he linked me to
a<00:03:12.629> page<00:03:12.840> and<00:03:13.019> I<00:03:13.079> started<00:03:13.349> looking<00:03:13.590> at<00:03:13.680> them<00:03:13.889> and

00:03:14.119 --> 00:03:14.129 
a page and I started looking at them and

00:03:14.129 --> 00:03:17.179 
a page and I started looking at them and
like<00:03:14.400> I'm<00:03:14.549> really<00:03:14.760> into<00:03:14.970> f2l<00:03:16.099> you<00:03:17.099> know

00:03:17.179 --> 00:03:17.189 
like I'm really into f2l you know

00:03:17.189 --> 00:03:20.360 
like I'm really into f2l you know
intuitive<00:03:17.669> f2l<00:03:18.090> so<00:03:18.780> he's<00:03:19.590> really<00:03:19.859> algorithm

00:03:20.360 --> 00:03:20.370 
intuitive f2l so he's really algorithm

00:03:20.370 --> 00:03:22.240 
intuitive f2l so he's really algorithm
based<00:03:20.549> so<00:03:20.790> I<00:03:20.819> was<00:03:21.030> wondering<00:03:21.329> like<00:03:21.359> how<00:03:21.510> do<00:03:21.690> i

00:03:22.240 --> 00:03:22.250 
based so I was wondering like how do i

00:03:22.250 --> 00:03:24.379 
based so I was wondering like how do i
how<00:03:23.250> do<00:03:23.310> I<00:03:23.430> get<00:03:23.549> faster<00:03:23.970> without<00:03:24.030> I'm<00:03:24.239> gonna

00:03:24.379 --> 00:03:24.389 
how do I get faster without I'm gonna

00:03:24.389 --> 00:03:25.640 
how do I get faster without I'm gonna
learn<00:03:24.510> all<00:03:24.629> the<00:03:24.780> algorithms<00:03:24.989> but<00:03:25.319> it<00:03:25.470> turns

00:03:25.640 --> 00:03:25.650 
learn all the algorithms but it turns

00:03:25.650 --> 00:03:27.500 
learn all the algorithms but it turns
out<00:03:25.769> I'm<00:03:25.949> gonna<00:03:26.069> have<00:03:26.280> to<00:03:26.430> learn<00:03:26.549> some<00:03:26.609> I<00:03:27.090> mean

00:03:27.500 --> 00:03:27.510 
out I'm gonna have to learn some I mean

00:03:27.510 --> 00:03:28.580 
out I'm gonna have to learn some I mean
you're<00:03:27.629> gonna<00:03:27.720> have<00:03:27.930> to<00:03:28.019> memorize<00:03:28.379> things

00:03:28.580 --> 00:03:28.590 
you're gonna have to memorize things

00:03:28.590 --> 00:03:31.580 
you're gonna have to memorize things
here<00:03:28.829> and<00:03:28.979> there<00:03:29.099> because<00:03:29.639> I<00:03:30.209> would<00:03:30.690> know<00:03:31.109> full

00:03:31.580 --> 00:03:31.590 
here and there because I would know full

00:03:31.590 --> 00:03:33.649 
here and there because I would know full
o<00:03:31.799> ll<00:03:32.099> at<00:03:32.250> this<00:03:32.400> point<00:03:32.639> if<00:03:32.790> I<00:03:32.909> really<00:03:33.269> cared<00:03:33.510> to

00:03:33.649 --> 00:03:33.659 
o ll at this point if I really cared to

00:03:33.659 --> 00:03:35.000 
o ll at this point if I really cared to
learn<00:03:33.810> a<00:03:33.840> bunch<00:03:34.019> of<00:03:34.199> algorithms<00:03:34.709> and<00:03:34.769> I<00:03:34.949> do

00:03:35.000 --> 00:03:35.010 
learn a bunch of algorithms and I do

00:03:35.010 --> 00:03:36.800 
learn a bunch of algorithms and I do
want<00:03:35.400> to<00:03:35.430> learn<00:03:35.579> full<00:03:35.819> well<00:03:36.120> I've<00:03:36.540> heard<00:03:36.750> that

00:03:36.800 --> 00:03:36.810 
want to learn full well I've heard that

00:03:36.810 --> 00:03:38.479 
want to learn full well I've heard that
it<00:03:37.079> will<00:03:37.229> make<00:03:37.379> me<00:03:37.500> a<00:03:37.530> little<00:03:37.799> bit<00:03:38.010> faster<00:03:38.370> but

00:03:38.479 --> 00:03:38.489 
it will make me a little bit faster but

00:03:38.489 --> 00:03:40.490 
it will make me a little bit faster but
not<00:03:38.609> a<00:03:38.639> lot<00:03:38.849> the<00:03:39.629> one<00:03:39.750> thing<00:03:39.930> I<00:03:40.019> really<00:03:40.260> need<00:03:40.379> to

00:03:40.490 --> 00:03:40.500 
not a lot the one thing I really need to

00:03:40.500 --> 00:03:44.059 
not a lot the one thing I really need to
refine<00:03:40.799> though<00:03:41.010> is<00:03:41.250> my<00:03:42.150> f2l<00:03:42.629> and<00:03:42.900> I've<00:03:43.709> come<00:03:44.040> to

00:03:44.059 --> 00:03:44.069 
refine though is my f2l and I've come to

00:03:44.069 --> 00:03:45.589 
refine though is my f2l and I've come to
learn<00:03:44.609> that<00:03:44.849> you<00:03:45.060> know<00:03:45.180> like<00:03:45.389> I<00:03:45.569> just

00:03:45.589 --> 00:03:45.599 
learn that you know like I just

00:03:45.599 --> 00:03:48.080 
learn that you know like I just
basically<00:03:46.310> learned<00:03:47.310> the<00:03:47.549> sledgehammer

00:03:48.080 --> 00:03:48.090 
basically learned the sledgehammer

00:03:48.090 --> 00:03:51.110 
basically learned the sledgehammer
technique<00:03:48.659> and<00:03:48.930> I<00:03:49.349> mean<00:03:49.819> apparently<00:03:50.819> that's<00:03:50.970> a

00:03:51.110 --> 00:03:51.120 
technique and I mean apparently that's a

00:03:51.120 --> 00:03:54.259 
technique and I mean apparently that's a
pretty<00:03:51.299> noob<00:03:51.629> thing<00:03:51.930> to<00:03:52.049> know<00:03:52.229> so<00:03:53.060> it<00:03:54.060> just

00:03:54.259 --> 00:03:54.269 
pretty noob thing to know so it just

00:03:54.269 --> 00:03:55.969 
pretty noob thing to know so it just
shows<00:03:54.329> you<00:03:54.479> know<00:03:54.690> I'm<00:03:54.989> kind<00:03:55.260> of<00:03:55.319> like<00:03:55.530> I<00:03:55.739> found

00:03:55.969 --> 00:03:55.979 
shows you know I'm kind of like I found

00:03:55.979 --> 00:03:57.319 
shows you know I'm kind of like I found
something<00:03:56.370> that<00:03:56.400> worked<00:03:56.699> and<00:03:56.879> I<00:03:56.939> just<00:03:57.180> got

00:03:57.319 --> 00:03:57.329 
something that worked and I just got

00:03:57.329 --> 00:03:59.089 
something that worked and I just got
faster<00:03:57.569> at<00:03:57.959> it<00:03:57.989> and<00:03:58.379> the<00:03:58.590> only<00:03:58.709> reason<00:03:58.919> I'm

00:03:59.089 --> 00:03:59.099 
faster at it and the only reason I'm

00:03:59.099 --> 00:04:00.830 
faster at it and the only reason I'm
getting<00:03:59.459> faster<00:03:59.669> without<00:04:00.209> actually<00:04:00.629> learning

00:04:00.830 --> 00:04:00.840 
getting faster without actually learning

00:04:00.840 --> 00:04:02.719 
getting faster without actually learning
new<00:04:01.229> stuff<00:04:01.500> is<00:04:01.680> because<00:04:02.069> I'm<00:04:02.220> getting<00:04:02.340> better

00:04:02.719 --> 00:04:02.729 
new stuff is because I'm getting better

00:04:02.729 --> 00:04:04.729 
new stuff is because I'm getting better
at<00:04:02.970> what<00:04:03.150> I<00:04:03.180> already<00:04:03.599> know<00:04:03.810> you<00:04:04.409> know<00:04:04.530> but<00:04:04.709> I

00:04:04.729 --> 00:04:04.739 
at what I already know you know but I

00:04:04.739 --> 00:04:06.589 
at what I already know you know but I
still<00:04:04.919> need<00:04:05.099> to<00:04:05.220> learn<00:04:05.430> new<00:04:05.790> stuff<00:04:06.209> in<00:04:06.449> order

00:04:06.589 --> 00:04:06.599 
still need to learn new stuff in order

00:04:06.599 --> 00:04:08.360 
still need to learn new stuff in order
to<00:04:06.689> get<00:04:06.810> shortcuts<00:04:07.379> in<00:04:07.590> and<00:04:07.949> all<00:04:08.010> that<00:04:08.129> kind<00:04:08.310> of

00:04:08.360 --> 00:04:08.370 
to get shortcuts in and all that kind of

00:04:08.370 --> 00:04:09.920 
to get shortcuts in and all that kind of
stuff<00:04:08.489> because<00:04:08.909> maybe<00:04:09.150> I'm<00:04:09.329> doing<00:04:09.599> it<00:04:09.720> really

00:04:09.920 --> 00:04:09.930 
stuff because maybe I'm doing it really

00:04:09.930 --> 00:04:13.460 
stuff because maybe I'm doing it really
slow<00:04:10.229> and<00:04:10.470> I<00:04:10.530> don't<00:04:10.590> even<00:04:10.739> know<00:04:12.229> another<00:04:13.229> thing

00:04:13.460 --> 00:04:13.470 
slow and I don't even know another thing

00:04:13.470 --> 00:04:15.140 
slow and I don't even know another thing
that<00:04:13.620> I've<00:04:13.739> been<00:04:13.769> told<00:04:14.069> to<00:04:14.220> by<00:04:15.090> people

00:04:15.140 --> 00:04:15.150 
that I've been told to by people

00:04:15.150 --> 00:04:17.449 
that I've been told to by people
watching<00:04:15.840> this<00:04:15.989> is<00:04:16.199> my<00:04:16.530> turns<00:04:16.829> for<00:04:17.070> a<00:04:17.099> second

00:04:17.449 --> 00:04:17.459 
watching this is my turns for a second

00:04:17.459 --> 00:04:19.539 
watching this is my turns for a second
they<00:04:17.519> said<00:04:17.699> you<00:04:17.820> need<00:04:17.970> to<00:04:18.030> turn<00:04:18.329> faster<00:04:18.959> and

00:04:19.539 --> 00:04:19.549 
they said you need to turn faster and

00:04:19.549 --> 00:04:23.600 
they said you need to turn faster and
yes<00:04:20.549> and<00:04:20.789> no<00:04:21.120> I<00:04:21.389> mean<00:04:21.950> maybe<00:04:22.950> they're<00:04:23.159> faster

00:04:23.600 --> 00:04:23.610 
yes and no I mean maybe they're faster

00:04:23.610 --> 00:04:25.519 
yes and no I mean maybe they're faster
than<00:04:23.760> me<00:04:23.909> but<00:04:24.510> they<00:04:24.690> also<00:04:24.870> know<00:04:25.110> how<00:04:25.139> to<00:04:25.260> look

00:04:25.519 --> 00:04:25.529 
than me but they also know how to look

00:04:25.529 --> 00:04:27.320 
than me but they also know how to look
ahead<00:04:25.680> more<00:04:26.130> you<00:04:26.430> know<00:04:26.580> if<00:04:26.700> I<00:04:26.849> start

00:04:27.320 --> 00:04:27.330 
ahead more you know if I start

00:04:27.330 --> 00:04:32.119 
ahead more you know if I start
turning<00:04:27.689> so<00:04:28.319> fast<00:04:28.970> that<00:04:29.970> I<00:04:30.449> can't<00:04:31.409> track<00:04:31.830> my

00:04:32.119 --> 00:04:32.129 
turning so fast that I can't track my

00:04:32.129 --> 00:04:33.890 
turning so fast that I can't track my
next<00:04:32.430> pair<00:04:32.699> then<00:04:33.150> it<00:04:33.270> defeats<00:04:33.659> the<00:04:33.780> purpose

00:04:33.890 --> 00:04:33.900 
next pair then it defeats the purpose

00:04:33.900 --> 00:04:36.860 
next pair then it defeats the purpose
the<00:04:34.830> time<00:04:35.099> I<00:04:35.129> saved<00:04:35.759> by<00:04:36.030> turning<00:04:36.419> real<00:04:36.569> fast

00:04:36.860 --> 00:04:36.870 
the time I saved by turning real fast

00:04:36.870 --> 00:04:39.559 
the time I saved by turning real fast
gets<00:04:37.439> spent<00:04:37.860> by<00:04:38.370> me<00:04:38.639> looking<00:04:39.150> for<00:04:39.389> my<00:04:39.509> next

00:04:39.559 --> 00:04:39.569 
gets spent by me looking for my next

00:04:39.569 --> 00:04:41.570 
gets spent by me looking for my next
pair<00:04:39.990> now<00:04:40.560> if<00:04:40.680> I'm<00:04:40.800> turning<00:04:41.039> at<00:04:41.219> a<00:04:41.250> slow<00:04:41.550> enough

00:04:41.570 --> 00:04:41.580 
pair now if I'm turning at a slow enough

00:04:41.580 --> 00:04:44.510 
pair now if I'm turning at a slow enough
speed<00:04:42.150> that<00:04:42.180> I<00:04:42.419> can<00:04:42.750> track<00:04:43.319> my<00:04:43.530> next<00:04:43.770> pair<00:04:44.039> that

00:04:44.510 --> 00:04:44.520 
speed that I can track my next pair that

00:04:44.520 --> 00:04:46.670 
speed that I can track my next pair that
kind<00:04:44.759> of<00:04:44.819> evens<00:04:45.270> out<00:04:45.419> and<00:04:45.689> that's<00:04:46.229> the<00:04:46.469> goal

00:04:46.670 --> 00:04:46.680 
kind of evens out and that's the goal

00:04:46.680 --> 00:04:49.369 
kind of evens out and that's the goal
because<00:04:47.069> I<00:04:47.280> will<00:04:47.550> get<00:04:47.729> faster<00:04:48.330> turning<00:04:49.080> slower

00:04:49.369 --> 00:04:49.379 
because I will get faster turning slower

00:04:49.379 --> 00:04:52.040 
because I will get faster turning slower
and<00:04:49.680> looking<00:04:50.009> ahead<00:04:50.129> then<00:04:50.969> I<00:04:51.090> will<00:04:51.330> by<00:04:51.810> just

00:04:52.040 --> 00:04:52.050 
and looking ahead then I will by just

00:04:52.050 --> 00:04:53.899 
and looking ahead then I will by just
turning<00:04:52.259> as<00:04:52.500> fast<00:04:52.770> as<00:04:52.949> I<00:04:53.069> can<00:04:53.129> and<00:04:53.520> turning<00:04:53.819> as

turning as fast as I can and turning as

00:04:53.909 --> 00:04:55.580 
turning as fast as I can and turning as
fast<00:04:54.090> as<00:04:54.240> you<00:04:54.330> can<00:04:54.479> can<00:04:54.780> be<00:04:54.900> a<00:04:54.930> bad<00:04:55.199> habit<00:04:55.530> to

00:04:55.580 --> 00:04:55.590 
fast as you can can be a bad habit to

00:04:55.590 --> 00:04:56.779 
fast as you can can be a bad habit to
get<00:04:55.680> out<00:04:55.800> of<00:04:55.919> I<00:04:55.979> mean<00:04:56.099> if<00:04:56.189> you<00:04:56.280> watch<00:04:56.490> some<00:04:56.759> of

get out of I mean if you watch some of
my<00:04:56.879> algorithms<00:04:57.509> on<00:04:57.629> PLL<00:04:58.050> I'm<00:04:58.740> not<00:04:58.949> bad<00:04:59.129> at<00:04:59.159> PLL

00:04:59.689 --> 00:04:59.699 
my algorithms on PLL I'm not bad at PLL

00:04:59.699 --> 00:05:00.950 
my algorithms on PLL I'm not bad at PLL
I<00:04:59.729> don't<00:05:00.000> think<00:05:00.180> I<00:05:00.240> don't<00:05:00.300> think<00:05:00.419> I'm<00:05:00.659> the<00:05:00.750> best

00:05:00.950 --> 00:05:00.960 
I don't think I don't think I'm the best

00:05:00.960 --> 00:05:02.899 
I don't think I don't think I'm the best
but<00:05:01.229> I<00:05:01.259> don't<00:05:01.440> think<00:05:01.530> I'm<00:05:01.710> too<00:05:01.889> bad<00:05:02.099> and<00:05:02.340> my

00:05:02.899 --> 00:05:02.909 
but I don't think I'm too bad and my

00:05:02.909 --> 00:05:04.879 
but I don't think I'm too bad and my
turns<00:05:03.180> per<00:05:03.389> second<00:05:03.810> are<00:05:04.199> actually<00:05:04.530> not<00:05:04.680> too

00:05:04.879 --> 00:05:04.889 
turns per second are actually not too

00:05:04.889 --> 00:05:07.459 
turns per second are actually not too
bad<00:05:05.069> I<00:05:05.099> mean<00:05:05.370> I'm<00:05:05.490> pretty<00:05:05.610> fast<00:05:05.969> I<00:05:06.930> just<00:05:07.289> don't

00:05:07.459 --> 00:05:07.469 
bad I mean I'm pretty fast I just don't

00:05:07.469 --> 00:05:09.050 
bad I mean I'm pretty fast I just don't
want<00:05:07.680> you<00:05:07.830> so<00:05:08.159> I<00:05:08.190> don't<00:05:08.370> lose<00:05:08.490> my<00:05:08.669> next<00:05:08.879> pair

00:05:09.050 --> 00:05:09.060 
want you so I don't lose my next pair

00:05:09.060 --> 00:05:11.089 
want you so I don't lose my next pair
that's<00:05:09.270> all<00:05:09.509> so<00:05:09.990> I<00:05:10.020> have<00:05:10.259> to<00:05:10.349> be<00:05:10.469> really<00:05:10.860> like

00:05:11.089 --> 00:05:11.099 
that's all so I have to be really like

00:05:11.099 --> 00:05:13.550 
that's all so I have to be really like
mindful<00:05:11.789> of<00:05:11.819> what<00:05:12.360> I<00:05:12.389> need<00:05:12.659> to<00:05:12.810> learn<00:05:12.990> so<00:05:13.289> I<00:05:13.319> can

00:05:13.550 --> 00:05:13.560 
mindful of what I need to learn so I can

00:05:13.560 --> 00:05:15.920 
mindful of what I need to learn so I can
progress<00:05:13.710> to<00:05:14.099> get<00:05:14.280> faster<00:05:14.969> you<00:05:15.539> know<00:05:15.659> and<00:05:15.870> I

00:05:15.920 --> 00:05:15.930 
progress to get faster you know and I

00:05:15.930 --> 00:05:17.300 
progress to get faster you know and I
think<00:05:16.139> that's<00:05:16.319> a<00:05:16.469> really<00:05:16.620> really<00:05:16.740> important

00:05:17.300 --> 00:05:17.310 
think that's a really really important

00:05:17.310 --> 00:05:19.129 
think that's a really really important
thing<00:05:17.490> to<00:05:17.669> remember<00:05:17.879> because<00:05:18.569> it's<00:05:18.719> easy<00:05:19.020> to

00:05:19.129 --> 00:05:19.139 
thing to remember because it's easy to

00:05:19.139 --> 00:05:23.240 
thing to remember because it's easy to
forget<00:05:19.560> to<00:05:20.039> practice<00:05:20.279> to<00:05:21.120> get<00:05:21.270> faster<00:05:21.900> I<00:05:22.250> hope

00:05:23.240 --> 00:05:23.250 
forget to practice to get faster I hope

00:05:23.250 --> 00:05:25.309 
forget to practice to get faster I hope
that<00:05:23.430> made<00:05:23.610> any<00:05:23.729> sense<00:05:23.879> at<00:05:24.449> all<00:05:24.569> because<00:05:24.930> it

00:05:25.309 --> 00:05:25.319 
that made any sense at all because it

00:05:25.319 --> 00:05:29.119 
that made any sense at all because it
makes<00:05:25.529> sense<00:05:25.680> to<00:05:25.889> me<00:05:26.009> but<00:05:26.659> anyway<00:05:27.659> so<00:05:28.009> here<00:05:29.009> we

00:05:29.119 --> 00:05:29.129 
makes sense to me but anyway so here we

00:05:29.129 --> 00:05:30.140 
makes sense to me but anyway so here we
are<00:05:29.159> it's<00:05:29.610> over

00:05:30.140 --> 00:05:30.150 
are it's over

are it's over
the<00:05:30.449> average<00:05:31.020> is<00:05:31.229> seventeen<00:05:31.979> point<00:05:32.430> nine<00:05:32.669> one

00:05:42.050 --> 00:05:42.060 
twenty five point one four I didn't know

twenty five point one four I didn't know
what<00:05:42.180> I<00:05:42.210> did<00:05:42.389> there<00:05:42.539> I<00:05:42.569> think<00:05:42.750> I<00:05:42.810> screwed<00:05:43.110> up<00:05:43.169> my

00:05:43.219 --> 00:05:43.229 
what I did there I think I screwed up my

00:05:43.229 --> 00:05:45.050 
what I did there I think I screwed up my
ol<00:05:43.500> algorithm<00:05:44.279> and<00:05:44.370> then<00:05:44.460> I<00:05:44.490> had<00:05:44.610> to<00:05:44.729> do<00:05:45.029> a

00:05:45.050 --> 00:05:45.060 
ol algorithm and then I had to do a

00:05:45.060 --> 00:05:47.329 
ol algorithm and then I had to do a
little<00:05:45.240> bit<00:05:45.419> of<00:05:45.449> f2l<00:05:45.930> and<00:05:46.110> then<00:05:46.199> redo<00:05:46.800> all<00:05:46.979> LM

00:05:47.329 --> 00:05:47.339 
little bit of f2l and then redo all LM

00:05:47.339 --> 00:05:49.610 
little bit of f2l and then redo all LM
PLL<00:05:47.699> but<00:05:47.879> anyway<00:05:48.719> so<00:05:48.779> seventeen<00:05:49.319> point<00:05:49.560> nine

00:05:49.610 --> 00:05:49.620 
PLL but anyway so seventeen point nine

00:05:49.620 --> 00:05:51.709 
PLL but anyway so seventeen point nine
one<00:05:49.919> my<00:05:50.339> next<00:05:50.580> one<00:05:50.729> is<00:05:50.789> actually<00:05:51.240> faster<00:05:51.599> than

00:05:51.709 --> 00:05:51.719 
one my next one is actually faster than
