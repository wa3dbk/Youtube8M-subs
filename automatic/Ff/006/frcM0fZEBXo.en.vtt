00:01:14.420 --> 00:01:14.430 
more attention to them particularly

00:01:14.430 --> 00:01:17.030 
more attention to them particularly
uncertain<00:01:14.880> downs<00:01:15.060> than<00:01:15.390> the<00:01:15.900> other<00:01:16.110> but<00:01:16.830> when

00:01:17.030 --> 00:01:17.040 
uncertain downs than the other but when

00:01:17.040 --> 00:01:19.969 
uncertain downs than the other but when
you<00:01:17.130> have<00:01:17.159> other<00:01:17.549> guys<00:01:17.790> to<00:01:18.290> to<00:01:19.290> cover<00:01:19.560> I<00:01:19.680> think

00:01:19.969 --> 00:01:19.979 
you have other guys to to cover I think

00:01:19.979 --> 00:01:21.109 
you have other guys to to cover I think
I<00:01:20.310> mean<00:01:20.430> I<00:01:20.490> know<00:01:20.549> if<00:01:20.670> that's<00:01:20.850> what<00:01:20.970> you're

00:01:21.109 --> 00:01:21.119 
I mean I know if that's what you're

00:01:21.119 --> 00:01:22.340 
I mean I know if that's what you're
alluding<00:01:21.299> to<00:01:21.570> the<00:01:21.689> fact<00:01:21.720> that<00:01:21.900> hasn't<00:01:22.229> caught

00:01:22.340 --> 00:01:22.350 
alluding to the fact that hasn't caught

00:01:22.350 --> 00:01:25.190 
alluding to the fact that hasn't caught
as<00:01:22.500> many<00:01:22.680> balls<00:01:22.890> but<00:01:23.630> we<00:01:24.630> kind<00:01:24.840> of<00:01:24.900> knew<00:01:25.020> that

00:01:25.190 --> 00:01:25.200 
as many balls but we kind of knew that

00:01:25.200 --> 00:01:26.570 
as many balls but we kind of knew that
going<00:01:25.350> into<00:01:25.560> this<00:01:25.650> season<00:01:25.740> which<00:01:26.189> is<00:01:26.340> more

00:01:26.570 --> 00:01:26.580 
going into this season which is more

00:01:26.580 --> 00:01:30.109 
going into this season which is more
guys<00:01:26.930> you<00:01:27.930> know<00:01:28.049> he<00:01:28.320> hit<00:01:29.189> p<00:01:29.400> rich<00:01:29.610> on<00:01:29.790> a<00:01:29.820> couple

00:01:30.109 --> 00:01:30.119 
guys you know he hit p rich on a couple

00:01:30.119 --> 00:01:33.050 
guys you know he hit p rich on a couple
balls<00:01:30.299> on<00:01:30.479> Saturday<00:01:30.960> so<00:01:31.020> I<00:01:31.490> think<00:01:32.490> the<00:01:32.729> more<00:01:32.909> he

00:01:33.050 --> 00:01:33.060 
balls on Saturday so I think the more he

00:01:33.060 --> 00:01:34.690 
balls on Saturday so I think the more he
gets<00:01:33.329> in<00:01:33.450> the<00:01:33.509> saddle<00:01:33.840> with<00:01:33.930> those<00:01:34.110> guys<00:01:34.320> and

00:01:34.690 --> 00:01:34.700 
gets in the saddle with those guys and

00:01:34.700 --> 00:01:39.920 
gets in the saddle with those guys and
they<00:01:35.700> learned<00:01:36.799> to<00:01:38.329> just<00:01:39.329> get<00:01:39.509> on<00:01:39.630> the<00:01:39.659> same

00:02:02.810 --> 00:02:02.820 
I thought we were actually probably got

00:02:02.820 --> 00:02:04.520 
I thought we were actually probably got
off<00:02:03.000> faster<00:02:03.450> than<00:02:03.479> we<00:02:03.689> did<00:02:03.840> the<00:02:04.079> last<00:02:04.110> couple

00:02:04.520 --> 00:02:04.530 
off faster than we did the last couple

00:02:04.530 --> 00:02:06.620 
off faster than we did the last couple
weeks<00:02:04.829> just<00:02:05.430> in<00:02:05.610> terms<00:02:05.759> of<00:02:05.909> their<00:02:06.030> tempo<00:02:06.360> early

00:02:06.620 --> 00:02:06.630 
weeks just in terms of their tempo early

00:02:06.630 --> 00:02:09.320 
weeks just in terms of their tempo early
on<00:02:07.190> ah<00:02:08.190> probably<00:02:08.789> little<00:02:09.030> bit<00:02:09.119> of<00:02:09.209> both

00:02:09.320 --> 00:02:09.330 
on ah probably little bit of both

00:02:09.330 --> 00:02:10.430
