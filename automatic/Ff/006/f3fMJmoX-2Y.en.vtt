00:01:49.110 --> 00:01:49.120 
days of actual time on orbit I think

00:01:49.120 --> 00:01:50.730 
days of actual time on orbit I think
that<00:01:49.300> you'd<00:01:49.450> call<00:01:49.660> that<00:01:49.720> a<00:01:49.900> fleet<00:01:50.229> leader<00:01:50.380> and

00:01:50.730 --> 00:01:50.740 
that you'd call that a fleet leader and

00:01:50.740 --> 00:01:53.250 
that you'd call that a fleet leader and
a<00:01:51.220> leader<00:01:51.250> of<00:01:51.670> any<00:01:51.820> manned<00:01:52.090> vehicle<00:01:52.570> for<00:01:52.870> time
