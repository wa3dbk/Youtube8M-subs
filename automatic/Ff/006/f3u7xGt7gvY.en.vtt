00:01:51.590 --> 00:01:51.600 
the turn of the millennium 2000 as one

00:01:51.600 --> 00:01:54.230 
the turn of the millennium 2000 as one
of<00:01:51.630> the<00:01:51.840> first<00:01:52.100> complicated<00:01:53.100> reverses<00:01:53.700> so

00:01:54.230 --> 00:01:54.240 
of the first complicated reverses so

00:01:54.240 --> 00:01:56.120 
of the first complicated reverses so
whereas<00:01:54.630> most<00:01:54.840> of<00:01:55.079> the<00:01:55.140> watches<00:01:55.619> built<00:01:55.860> in<00:01:56.040> the

00:01:56.120 --> 00:01:56.130 
whereas most of the watches built in the

00:01:56.130 --> 00:01:58.580 
whereas most of the watches built in the
reversal<00:01:56.610> line<00:01:56.820> since<00:01:57.180> 31<00:01:57.659> had<00:01:57.840> been<00:01:58.020> time

only watches sometimes with a small
second<00:02:01.170> this<00:02:01.560> one<00:02:01.799> incorporates<00:02:02.369> both<00:02:02.729> a<00:02:03.030> day

00:02:03.950 --> 00:02:03.960 
second this one incorporates both a day

00:02:03.960 --> 00:02:06.980 
second this one incorporates both a day
and<00:02:04.670> date<00:02:05.670> function<00:02:06.210> it's<00:02:06.360> a<00:02:06.450> radial<00:02:06.780> date

00:02:06.980 --> 00:02:06.990 
and date function it's a radial date

00:02:06.990 --> 00:02:09.229

along<00:02:07.619> with<00:02:07.829> small<00:02:08.099> seconds<00:02:08.580> so<00:02:09.000> you<00:02:09.060> have

00:02:09.229 --> 00:02:09.239 
along with small seconds so you have

00:02:09.239 --> 00:02:10.910 
along with small seconds so you have
quite<00:02:09.390> a<00:02:09.479> bit<00:02:09.660> of<00:02:09.690> functionality<00:02:10.379> and<00:02:10.530> this<00:02:10.800> is

00:02:10.910 --> 00:02:10.920 
quite a bit of functionality and this is

00:02:10.920 --> 00:02:12.770 
quite a bit of functionality and this is
an<00:02:11.009> everyday<00:02:11.280> complication<00:02:12.150> that's<00:02:12.390> welcome
