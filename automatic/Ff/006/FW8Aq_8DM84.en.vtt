have<00:00:49.950> switched<00:00:50.610> to<00:00:50.789> unholy<00:00:51.090> now<00:00:51.360> I<00:00:51.629> switch<00:00:52.440> to

00:00:52.490 --> 00:00:52.500 
have switched to unholy now I switch to

00:00:52.500 --> 00:00:54.680 
have switched to unholy now I switch to
unholy<00:00:52.920> for<00:00:53.190> tues<00:00:53.399> I<00:00:53.730> was<00:00:54.120> doing<00:00:54.329> tues<00:00:54.510> with

00:00:54.680 --> 00:00:54.690 
unholy for tues I was doing tues with

00:00:54.690 --> 00:00:56.360 
unholy for tues I was doing tues with
the<00:00:54.780> frost<00:00:55.020> mage<00:00:55.289> and<00:00:55.530> it<00:00:55.649> seemed<00:00:55.949> to<00:00:56.070> be<00:00:56.190> more

00:00:56.360 --> 00:00:56.370 
the frost mage and it seemed to be more

00:00:56.370 --> 00:01:00.500 
the frost mage and it seemed to be more
effective<00:00:57.090> to<00:00:57.300> play<00:00:58.260> on<00:00:58.440> wholly<00:00:58.710> unholy<00:00:59.059> is<00:01:00.059> by

00:01:00.500 --> 00:01:00.510 
effective to play on wholly unholy is by

00:01:00.510 --> 00:01:03.229 
effective to play on wholly unholy is by
far<00:01:00.809> less<00:01:01.170> effective<00:01:01.739> in<00:01:01.949> battlegrounds<00:01:02.730> it's

00:01:03.229 --> 00:01:03.239 
far less effective in battlegrounds it's

00:01:03.239 --> 00:01:06.289 
far less effective in battlegrounds it's
still<00:01:03.600> viable<00:01:03.840> but<00:01:04.409> less<00:01:04.589> effective<00:01:05.299> the

00:01:06.289 --> 00:01:06.299 
still viable but less effective the

00:01:06.299 --> 00:01:08.090 
still viable but less effective the
reason<00:01:06.689> being<00:01:06.720> is<00:01:07.080> because<00:01:07.110> battlegrounds

00:01:08.090 --> 00:01:08.100 
reason being is because battlegrounds

00:01:08.100 --> 00:01:10.429 
reason being is because battlegrounds
pretty<00:01:08.580> much<00:01:08.760> rely<00:01:09.119> on<00:01:09.330> AoE<00:01:09.659> and<00:01:09.990> burst<00:01:10.170> damage

00:01:10.429 --> 00:01:10.439 
pretty much rely on AoE and burst damage

00:01:10.439 --> 00:01:12.440 
pretty much rely on AoE and burst damage
and<00:01:10.920> then<00:01:11.070> holy<00:01:11.280> has<00:01:11.460> an<00:01:11.580> incredible<00:01:12.000> lack<00:01:12.240> of

00:01:12.440 --> 00:01:12.450 
and then holy has an incredible lack of

00:01:12.450 --> 00:01:14.719 
and then holy has an incredible lack of
both<00:01:12.689> of<00:01:12.720> those<00:01:13.080> without<00:01:13.830> ramp<00:01:14.310> up<00:01:14.520> time

00:01:14.719 --> 00:01:14.729 
both of those without ramp up time

00:01:14.729 --> 00:01:17.690 
both of those without ramp up time
and/or<00:01:15.619> cooldown<00:01:16.619> usage<00:01:17.040> which<00:01:17.280> really<00:01:17.520> kind

00:01:17.690 --> 00:01:17.700 
and/or cooldown usage which really kind

00:01:17.700 --> 00:01:19.820 
and/or cooldown usage which really kind
of<00:01:17.790> sucks<00:01:18.030> but<00:01:18.360> I've<00:01:19.110> still<00:01:19.259> been<00:01:19.350> having<00:01:19.650> fun
