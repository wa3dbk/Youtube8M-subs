that's where all the high levels go so

00:01:51.600 --> 00:01:53.210 
that's where all the high levels go so
if<00:01:51.689> you'd<00:01:51.869> the<00:01:51.990> level<00:01:52.320> to<00:01:52.409> go<00:01:52.530> down<00:01:52.710> just<00:01:52.950> go

00:01:53.210 --> 00:01:53.220 
if you'd the level to go down just go

00:01:53.220 --> 00:01:55.639 
if you'd the level to go down just go
not<00:01:53.430> and<00:01:53.729> live<00:01:54.509> as<00:01:54.689> much<00:01:54.810> as<00:01:54.990> you<00:01:55.079> can<00:01:55.229> people

00:01:55.639 --> 00:01:55.649 
not and live as much as you can people

00:01:55.649 --> 00:01:58.219 
not and live as much as you can people
go<00:01:55.740> there<00:01:55.920> for<00:01:56.070> 99<00:01:56.520> so<00:01:57.390> i'll<00:01:57.719> show<00:01:57.899> you<00:01:57.960> just

00:01:58.219 --> 00:01:58.229 
go there for 99 so i'll show you just

00:01:58.229 --> 00:01:59.840 
go there for 99 so i'll show you just
how<00:01:58.350> many<00:01:58.469> you<00:01:58.770> can<00:01:58.920> get<00:01:59.159> in<00:01:59.399> a<00:01:59.490> couple<00:01:59.820> of

00:01:59.840 --> 00:01:59.850 
how many you can get in a couple of

00:01:59.850 --> 00:02:02.359 
how many you can get in a couple of
seconds<00:02:00.360> in<00:02:00.420> a<00:02:00.509> minute<00:02:00.540> while<00:02:01.439> converting<00:02:02.189> it

00:02:02.359 --> 00:02:02.369 
seconds in a minute while converting it

00:02:02.369 --> 00:02:04.910 
seconds in a minute while converting it
to<00:02:02.399> the<00:02:02.579> energy<00:02:02.909> ref<00:02:03.119> right<00:02:03.840> so<00:02:04.259> let's<00:02:04.649> just

00:02:04.910 --> 00:02:04.920 
to the energy ref right so let's just

00:02:04.920 --> 00:02:07.819 
to the energy ref right so let's just
convert<00:02:05.340> it<00:02:05.759> all<00:02:05.909> to<00:02:06.270> basic<00:02:06.780> energy<00:02:06.930> as<00:02:07.530> you

00:02:07.819 --> 00:02:07.829 
convert it all to basic energy as you

00:02:07.829 --> 00:02:10.999 
convert it all to basic energy as you
can<00:02:07.950> see<00:02:08.099> you<00:02:08.250> get<00:02:08.459> free<00:02:08.879> /<00:02:09.450> little<00:02:10.009> siphon

00:02:10.999 --> 00:02:11.009 
can see you get free / little siphon

00:02:11.009 --> 00:02:12.800 
can see you get free / little siphon
finger<00:02:11.280> while<00:02:11.430> converting

00:02:12.800 --> 00:02:12.810 
finger while converting

00:02:12.810 --> 00:02:16.460 
finger while converting
and<00:02:12.980> you'll<00:02:13.980> basically<00:02:14.310> just<00:02:14.880> get<00:02:15.209> from<00:02:16.020> about

00:02:16.460 --> 00:02:16.470 
and you'll basically just get from about

00:02:16.470 --> 00:02:18.770 
and you'll basically just get from about
Phil<00:02:16.709> inventories<00:02:17.250> worth<00:02:17.459> i<00:02:17.760> would<00:02:18.090> predict

00:02:18.770 --> 00:02:18.780 
Phil inventories worth i would predict

00:02:18.780 --> 00:02:23.210 
Phil inventories worth i would predict
maybe<00:02:19.260> a<00:02:19.680> hundred<00:02:20.489> and<00:02:20.970> sixty<00:02:21.540> 150<00:02:22.410> in<00:02:22.620> and<00:02:23.040> out

00:02:23.210 --> 00:02:23.220 
maybe a hundred and sixty 150 in and out

00:02:23.220 --> 00:02:25.339 
maybe a hundred and sixty 150 in and out
number<00:02:23.430> probably<00:02:23.970> more<00:02:24.450> knowing<00:02:24.780> my<00:02:25.080> mouth

00:02:25.339 --> 00:02:25.349 
number probably more knowing my mouth

00:02:25.349 --> 00:02:28.610 
number probably more knowing my mouth
and<00:02:26.540> i'll<00:02:27.540> just<00:02:27.870> show<00:02:27.989> you<00:02:28.020> the<00:02:28.200> price<00:02:28.349> in<00:02:28.410> a

00:02:28.610 --> 00:02:28.620 
and i'll just show you the price in a

00:02:28.620 --> 00:02:32.449 
and i'll just show you the price in a
sack<00:02:28.830> alright<00:02:29.760> so<00:02:30.030> bang<00:02:30.360> 1<00:02:30.569> 165<00:02:31.440> just<00:02:32.040> from

00:02:32.449 --> 00:02:32.459 
sack alright so bang 1 165 just from

00:02:32.459 --> 00:02:35.720 
sack alright so bang 1 165 just from
about<00:02:33.300> two<00:02:33.900> minutes<00:02:34.080> worth<00:02:34.349> of<00:02:34.590> the<00:02:35.310> veneering

00:02:35.720 --> 00:02:35.730 
about two minutes worth of the veneering

00:02:35.730 --> 00:02:38.390 
about two minutes worth of the veneering
and<00:02:35.880> that<00:02:36.510> comes<00:02:36.720> up<00:02:36.870> to<00:02:37.080> a<00:02:37.110> nice<00:02:37.709> total<00:02:38.190> of

00:02:38.390 --> 00:02:38.400 
and that comes up to a nice total of

00:02:38.400 --> 00:02:42.320 
and that comes up to a nice total of
fifteen<00:02:39.239> GP<00:02:39.959> no<00:02:40.800> that<00:02:41.610> was<00:02:41.640> only<00:02:42.090> in<00:02:42.180> like<00:02:42.300> a

00:02:42.320 --> 00:02:42.330 
fifteen GP no that was only in like a

00:02:42.330 --> 00:02:44.509 
fifteen GP no that was only in like a
couple<00:02:42.780> of<00:02:42.989> minutes<00:02:43.080> and<00:02:43.470> as<00:02:44.280> you<00:02:44.370> can<00:02:44.489> see

00:02:44.509 --> 00:02:44.519 
couple of minutes and as you can see

00:02:44.519 --> 00:02:46.640 
couple of minutes and as you can see
it's<00:02:44.760> relatively<00:02:45.120> decent<00:02:45.540> money<00:02:45.660> now<00:02:46.230> I<00:02:46.260> don't

00:02:46.640 --> 00:02:46.650 
it's relatively decent money now I don't

00:02:46.650 --> 00:02:48.830 
it's relatively decent money now I don't
need<00:02:47.040> this<00:02:47.220> lustrous<00:02:47.610> energy<00:02:48.060> so<00:02:48.299> let's<00:02:48.630> just

00:02:48.830 --> 00:02:48.840 
need this lustrous energy so let's just

00:02:48.840 --> 00:02:50.870 
need this lustrous energy so let's just
drop<00:02:49.019> that<00:02:49.080> I<00:02:49.470> don't<00:02:49.769> need<00:02:49.920> it<00:02:50.100> like<00:02:50.250> I<00:02:50.280> say<00:02:50.610> and

00:02:50.870 --> 00:02:50.880 
drop that I don't need it like I say and

00:02:50.880 --> 00:02:53.090 
drop that I don't need it like I say and
now<00:02:51.600> i'm<00:02:51.720> going<00:02:51.840> to<00:02:51.900> time<00:02:52.200> myself<00:02:52.440> for<00:02:52.890> five

00:02:53.090 --> 00:02:53.100 
now i'm going to time myself for five

00:02:53.100 --> 00:02:55.430 
now i'm going to time myself for five
minutes<00:02:53.340> donating<00:02:54.030> and<00:02:54.209> getting<00:02:54.780> pale<00:02:54.989> energy

00:02:55.430 --> 00:02:55.440 
minutes donating and getting pale energy

00:02:55.440 --> 00:02:57.110 
minutes donating and getting pale energy
i'm<00:02:55.799> just<00:02:55.950> showing<00:02:56.100> you<00:02:56.250> how<00:02:56.519> much<00:02:56.549> you<00:02:57.000> can

00:02:57.110 --> 00:02:57.120 
i'm just showing you how much you can

00:02:57.120 --> 00:03:14.970 
i'm just showing you how much you can
make<00:02:57.330> a<00:02:57.360> fart

00:03:14.970 --> 00:03:14.980 

00:03:14.980 --> 00:04:10.210 

you

00:04:10.210 --> 00:04:10.220 

00:04:10.220 --> 00:04:13.460 

and<00:04:11.220> there<00:04:11.820> we<00:04:11.940> go<00:04:11.970> there's<00:04:12.480> five<00:04:12.870> minutes<00:04:13.260> and

00:04:13.460 --> 00:04:13.470 
and there we go there's five minutes and

00:04:13.470 --> 00:04:15.200 
and there we go there's five minutes and
during<00:04:14.040> that<00:04:14.160> time<00:04:14.250> we've<00:04:14.610> managed<00:04:14.940> to<00:04:14.970> make

00:04:15.200 --> 00:04:15.210 
during that time we've managed to make

00:04:15.210 --> 00:04:18.560 
during that time we've managed to make
474<00:04:16.200> lustrous<00:04:16.739> energy<00:04:17.220> so<00:04:17.760> let's<00:04:18.120> just<00:04:18.300> check

00:04:18.560 --> 00:04:18.570 
474 lustrous energy so let's just check

00:04:18.570 --> 00:04:22.880 
474 lustrous energy so let's just check
the<00:04:18.750> price<00:04:18.959> a<00:04:18.989> lot<00:04:21.050> so<00:04:22.050> in<00:04:22.140> five<00:04:22.350> minutes<00:04:22.620> I

00:04:22.880 --> 00:04:22.890 
the price a lot so in five minutes I

00:04:22.890 --> 00:04:25.790 
the price a lot so in five minutes I
have<00:04:22.980> made<00:04:23.160> Fredi<00:04:23.490> 4k<00:04:24.000> and<00:04:24.330> if<00:04:25.140> you<00:04:25.320> multiply

00:04:25.790 --> 00:04:25.800 
have made Fredi 4k and if you multiply

00:04:25.800 --> 00:04:29.470 
have made Fredi 4k and if you multiply
Freddy<00:04:26.160> for<00:04:26.430> K<00:04:26.610> by<00:04:26.850> 2<00:04:27.080> that<00:04:28.080> would<00:04:28.290> make<00:04:28.470> 69<00:04:29.100> k

00:04:29.470 --> 00:04:29.480 
Freddy for K by 2 that would make 69 k

00:04:29.480 --> 00:04:33.110 
Freddy for K by 2 that would make 69 k
564<00:04:30.480> GP<00:04:30.870> multiply<00:04:31.560> that<00:04:31.680> again<00:04:32.100> by<00:04:32.310> six<00:04:32.640> you're

00:04:33.110 --> 00:04:33.120 
564 GP multiply that again by six you're

00:04:33.120 --> 00:04:36.080 
564 GP multiply that again by six you're
making<00:04:33.500> 417<00:04:34.500> k<00:04:34.740> /<00:04:34.950> are<00:04:35.070> at<00:04:35.370> the<00:04:35.520> level<00:04:35.640> sandy

00:04:36.080 --> 00:04:36.090 
making 417 k / are at the level sandy

00:04:36.090 --> 00:04:39.080 
making 417 k / are at the level sandy
spot<00:04:36.330> so<00:04:37.140> let's<00:04:37.590> do<00:04:37.980> a<00:04:38.010> bit<00:04:38.220> of<00:04:38.250> math<00:04:38.550> at<00:04:38.880> the

00:04:39.080 --> 00:04:39.090 
spot so let's do a bit of math at the

00:04:39.090 --> 00:04:40.940 
spot so let's do a bit of math at the
lowest<00:04:39.330> level<00:04:39.570> area<00:04:39.840> you<00:04:40.200> can<00:04:40.410> get<00:04:40.590> pale

00:04:40.940 --> 00:04:40.950 
lowest level area you can get pale

00:04:40.950 --> 00:04:43.610 
lowest level area you can get pale
energy<00:04:41.430> which<00:04:41.640> costs<00:04:42.150> freddie.ing<00:04:42.480> p<00:04:42.930> let's

00:04:43.610 --> 00:04:43.620 
energy which costs freddie.ing p let's

00:04:43.620 --> 00:04:46.040 
energy which costs freddie.ing p let's
say<00:04:44.100> I<00:04:44.370> managed<00:04:44.760> to<00:04:44.790> get<00:04:44.970> friends<00:04:45.270> and<00:04:45.390> 74<00:04:45.960> of

00:04:46.040 --> 00:04:46.050 
say I managed to get friends and 74 of

00:04:46.050 --> 00:04:48.050 
say I managed to get friends and 74 of
those<00:04:46.170> in<00:04:46.380> five<00:04:46.620> minutes<00:04:46.830> like<00:04:47.370> I<00:04:47.520> did<00:04:47.730> with

00:04:48.050 --> 00:04:48.060 
those in five minutes like I did with

00:04:48.060 --> 00:04:50.270 
those in five minutes like I did with
the<00:04:48.240> energy<00:04:48.630> here<00:04:48.960> that<00:04:49.620> would<00:04:49.860> mean<00:04:50.220> that

00:04:50.270 --> 00:04:50.280 
the energy here that would mean that

00:04:50.280 --> 00:04:54.080 
the energy here that would mean that
I've<00:04:50.610> made<00:04:50.910> 14<00:04:51.510> K<00:04:51.810> in<00:04:52.140> five<00:04:52.560> minutes<00:04:52.830> 14<00:04:53.820> K

00:04:54.080 --> 00:04:54.090 
I've made 14 K in five minutes 14 K

00:04:54.090 --> 00:05:00.710 
I've made 14 K in five minutes 14 K
divided<00:04:54.540> by<00:04:54.840> 2<00:04:54.950> comes<00:04:55.950> up<00:04:56.250> to<00:04:56.820> be<00:04:57.680> about<00:04:59.480> 28<00:05:00.480> to

00:05:00.710 --> 00:05:00.720 
divided by 2 comes up to be about 28 to
