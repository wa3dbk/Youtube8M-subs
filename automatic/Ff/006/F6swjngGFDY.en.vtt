00:00:03.600 --> 00:00:05.030 
tea for AIDS look at this I'm in the red
and<00:00:03.689> white<00:00:03.840> here<00:00:04.049> obviously<00:00:04.620> frustrated

because<00:00:05.130> I<00:00:05.310> have<00:00:05.460> the<00:00:05.580> ball<00:00:05.790> he<00:00:06.000> never<00:00:06.150> touches

00:00:06.619 --> 00:00:06.629 
because I have the ball he never touches

00:00:06.629 --> 00:00:09.140 
because I have the ball he never touches
it<00:00:06.779> but<00:00:07.200> somehow<00:00:07.379> shoots<00:00:07.799> it<00:00:07.980> through<00:00:08.370> me<00:00:08.550> with

00:00:09.140 --> 00:00:09.150 
it but somehow shoots it through me with

another ghost hand ball like FIFA what
are<00:00:36.149> you<00:00:36.210> doing<00:00:36.739> deciding<00:00:37.739> when<00:00:37.860> people<00:00:38.100> score

00:00:38.479 --> 00:00:38.489 
are you doing deciding when people score

are you doing deciding when people score
based<00:00:39.239> on<00:00:39.390> your<00:00:39.540> game<00:00:39.719> physics<00:00:40.020> being<00:00:40.469> messed

00:00:40.670 --> 00:00:40.680 
based on your game physics being messed

based on your game physics being messed
up<00:00:40.829> a<00:00:40.980> stupid<00:00:41.340> I<00:00:41.460> mean<00:00:41.489> I<00:00:41.850> don't<00:00:42.390> even<00:00:42.510> know<00:00:42.690> how

00:00:42.770 --> 00:00:42.780 
up a stupid I mean I don't even know how

00:00:42.780 --> 00:00:43.700 
up a stupid I mean I don't even know how
to<00:00:42.809> explain<00:00:43.140> this<00:00:43.290> anymore

00:00:43.700 --> 00:00:43.710 
to explain this anymore

00:00:43.710 --> 00:00:46.850 
to explain this anymore
your<00:00:44.250> code<00:00:44.489> is<00:00:44.520> broken<00:00:44.969> for<00:00:45.270> this<00:00:45.360> game<00:00:45.960> you're

00:00:46.850 --> 00:00:46.860 
your code is broken for this game you're

00:00:46.860 --> 00:00:48.619 
your code is broken for this game you're
next<00:00:47.070> Jin<00:00:47.370> hopefully<00:00:48.000> this<00:00:48.210> is<00:00:48.360> just<00:00:48.539> a

00:00:48.619 --> 00:00:48.629 
next Jin hopefully this is just a

00:00:48.629 --> 00:00:50.720 
next Jin hopefully this is just a
problem<00:00:48.809> with<00:00:48.989> like<00:00:49.350> the<00:00:49.590> transistor<00:00:50.430> next

00:00:50.720 --> 00:00:50.730 
problem with like the transistor next

00:00:50.730 --> 00:00:53.299 
problem with like the transistor next
Jin<00:00:51.030> and<00:00:51.300> the<00:00:51.360> expo<00:00:52.289> offline<00:00:52.590> Xbox<00:00:52.949> one<00:00:53.100> by<00:00:53.250> the

00:00:53.299 --> 00:00:53.309 
Jin and the expo offline Xbox one by the

00:00:53.309 --> 00:00:54.380 
Jin and the expo offline Xbox one by the
way<00:00:53.460> but<00:00:53.670> I've<00:00:53.789> heard<00:00:54.000> people<00:00:54.120> have<00:00:54.300> these

00:00:54.380 --> 00:00:54.390 
way but I've heard people have these

00:00:54.390 --> 00:00:56.029 
way but I've heard people have these
problems<00:00:54.719> on<00:00:54.780> all<00:00:54.960> consoles<00:00:55.440> but<00:00:55.620> maybe<00:00:55.800> just

00:00:56.029 --> 00:00:56.039 
problems on all consoles but maybe just

00:00:56.039 --> 00:00:57.889 
problems on all consoles but maybe just
making<00:00:56.280> a<00:00:56.340> game<00:00:56.550> for<00:00:57.030> across<00:00:57.270> platforms<00:00:57.809> I

00:00:57.889 --> 00:00:57.899 
making a game for across platforms I

00:00:57.899 --> 00:00:59.299 
making a game for across platforms I
don't<00:00:58.050> know<00:00:58.109> but<00:00:58.649> then<00:00:58.770> you<00:00:58.829> look<00:00:58.949> at<00:00:59.100> all<00:00:59.190> the

00:00:59.299 --> 00:00:59.309 
don't know but then you look at all the

00:00:59.309 --> 00:01:01.279 
don't know but then you look at all the
FIFA<00:00:59.550> 8<00:00:59.699> videos<00:01:00.059> look<00:01:00.719> at<00:01:00.809> this<00:01:00.930> one<00:01:01.079> by<00:01:01.230> the

00:01:01.279 --> 00:01:01.289 
FIFA 8 videos look at this one by the

00:01:01.289 --> 00:01:02.599 
FIFA 8 videos look at this one by the
way<00:01:01.440> real<00:01:01.770> quick<00:01:01.949> before<00:01:02.039> I<00:01:02.190> explain<00:01:02.460> what<00:01:02.520> I

00:01:02.599 --> 00:01:02.609

00:01:04.340 --> 00:01:04.350 
was talking about Levin dusky his body

00:01:04.350 --> 00:01:06.320 
was talking about Levin dusky his body
warps<00:01:04.799> what<00:01:05.129> the<00:01:05.220> hell<00:01:05.339> is<00:01:05.460> that<00:01:05.489> he<00:01:06.180> like

00:01:06.320 --> 00:01:06.330 
warps what the hell is that he like

00:01:08.390 --> 00:01:08.400 
grows five inches on his shoulders look

00:01:08.400 --> 00:01:10.250 
grows five inches on his shoulders look
at<00:01:08.520> that<00:01:08.640> do<00:01:09.030> you<00:01:09.060> see<00:01:09.119> that<00:01:09.360> so<00:01:09.900> he<00:01:10.049> can<00:01:10.170> get

00:01:10.250 --> 00:01:10.260 
at that do you see that so he can get

00:01:10.260 --> 00:01:12.410 
at that do you see that so he can get
that<00:01:10.409> header<00:01:10.619> and<00:01:11.000> he<00:01:12.000> didn't<00:01:12.150> even<00:01:12.240> really

00:01:12.410 --> 00:01:12.420 
that header and he didn't even really

00:01:12.420 --> 00:01:13.520 
that header and he didn't even really
touch<00:01:12.659> the<00:01:12.780> ball<00:01:12.930> cuz<00:01:13.080> it's<00:01:13.170> gotta<00:01:13.290> go<00:01:13.380> through

00:01:13.520 --> 00:01:13.530 
touch the ball cuz it's gotta go through

00:01:13.530 --> 00:01:16.039 
touch the ball cuz it's gotta go through
my<00:01:13.619> guy's<00:01:13.799> head<00:01:14.299> right<00:01:15.299> into<00:01:15.390> the<00:01:15.509> corner<00:01:15.869> did

00:01:16.039 --> 00:01:16.049 
my guy's head right into the corner did

00:01:16.049 --> 00:01:17.390 
my guy's head right into the corner did
y'all<00:01:16.170> see<00:01:16.200> that<00:01:16.530> that<00:01:16.890> was<00:01:17.009> ridiculous

00:01:17.390 --> 00:01:17.400
