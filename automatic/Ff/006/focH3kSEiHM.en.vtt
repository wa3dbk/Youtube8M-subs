on<00:00:03.090> a<00:00:03.179> daily<00:00:03.360> basis<00:00:03.870> we<00:00:04.080> view<00:00:04.470> the<00:00:04.590> world<00:00:04.740> from

00:00:04.940 --> 00:00:04.950 
on a daily basis we view the world from

00:00:04.950 --> 00:00:07.039 
on a daily basis we view the world from

about getting low down or getting up

00:00:47.940 --> 00:00:50.660 
about getting low down or getting up

00:00:53.419 --> 00:00:53.429 
whole new perspective you'll find even

the<00:00:53.460> simplest<00:00:53.850> subject<00:00:54.299> matter<00:00:54.479> will<00:00:54.960> appear

00:00:55.309 --> 00:00:55.319 
the simplest subject matter will appear

the simplest subject matter will appear
more<00:00:55.920> imposing<00:00:56.280> from<00:00:56.760> a<00:00:56.819> low<00:00:56.969> level<00:00:57.179> or

00:00:57.469 --> 00:00:57.479 
more imposing from a low level or

00:00:57.479 --> 00:01:00.500 
more imposing from a low level or

we<00:01:19.140> don't<00:01:19.229> want<00:01:19.469> you<00:01:19.560> to<00:01:19.680> cut<00:01:19.950> anyone's<00:01:20.280> head

we don't want you to cut anyone's head
off<00:01:20.490> but<00:01:21.090> rather<00:01:21.329> just<00:01:22.020> crop<00:01:22.350> in<00:01:22.500> on<00:01:22.680> their

faces or frame the subject matter in a
way<00:01:25.710> that's<00:01:26.070> more<00:01:26.640> interesting<00:01:27.299> than<00:01:27.390> just

00:01:27.709 --> 00:01:27.719 
way that's more interesting than just

00:01:27.719 --> 00:01:30.289 
way that's more interesting than just
centering<00:01:28.409> it<00:01:28.530> in<00:01:28.619> the<00:01:28.680> image<00:01:28.950> this<00:01:29.939> makes<00:01:30.180> for

00:01:30.289 --> 00:01:30.299 
centering it in the image this makes for

00:01:30.299 --> 00:01:32.690 
centering it in the image this makes for
more<00:01:30.539> intimate<00:01:31.109> imagery<00:01:31.560> which<00:01:31.979> is<00:01:32.189> rarely

00:01:32.690 --> 00:01:32.700 
more intimate imagery which is rarely

00:01:32.700 --> 00:01:35.209 
more intimate imagery which is rarely

00:01:35.209 --> 00:01:35.219 
experienced in the real world you can

00:01:35.219 --> 00:01:37.279 
experienced in the real world you can
even<00:01:35.340> try<00:01:35.609> this<00:01:35.670> by<00:01:36.060> cropping<00:01:36.750> photographs

00:01:37.279 --> 00:01:37.289 
even try this by cropping photographs

00:01:37.289 --> 00:01:39.289 
even try this by cropping photographs
you've<00:01:37.439> already<00:01:37.710> taken<00:01:37.859> so<00:01:38.789> good<00:01:39.000> composition

00:01:39.289 --> 00:01:39.299 
you've already taken so good composition

00:01:39.299 --> 00:01:41.569 
you've already taken so good composition
is<00:01:39.659> one<00:01:40.079> of<00:01:40.170> the<00:01:40.259> easiest<00:01:40.619> and<00:01:40.920> most<00:01:40.979> effective

00:01:41.569 --> 00:01:41.579 
is one of the easiest and most effective

00:01:41.579 --> 00:01:43.819 
is one of the easiest and most effective
ways<00:01:41.969> to<00:01:42.479> take<00:01:42.659> your<00:01:42.840> photography<00:01:42.960> to<00:01:43.740> the

00:01:43.819 --> 00:01:43.829 
ways to take your photography to the

00:01:43.829 --> 00:01:46.459 
ways to take your photography to the
next<00:01:44.130> level<00:01:44.399> there<00:01:45.359> are<00:01:45.420> a<00:01:45.479> lot<00:01:45.570> of<00:01:45.600> rules<00:01:46.170> and

00:01:46.459 --> 00:01:46.469 
next level there are a lot of rules and

00:01:46.469 --> 00:01:48.020 
next level there are a lot of rules and
checklists<00:01:46.920> that<00:01:47.159> you<00:01:47.310> might<00:01:47.460> find<00:01:47.490> valuable

00:01:48.020 --> 00:01:48.030 
checklists that you might find valuable

00:01:48.030 --> 00:01:50.899 
checklists that you might find valuable
but<00:01:48.689> for<00:01:49.229> me<00:01:49.380> the<00:01:49.799> best<00:01:49.979> two<00:01:50.249> ways<00:01:50.490> to<00:01:50.759> learn

00:01:50.899 --> 00:01:50.909 
but for me the best two ways to learn

00:01:50.909 --> 00:01:53.929 
but for me the best two ways to learn
better<00:01:51.479> composition<00:01:51.869> is<00:01:52.619> simply<00:01:53.039> taking<00:01:53.789> more

00:01:53.929 --> 00:01:53.939 
better composition is simply taking more

00:01:53.939 --> 00:01:56.840 
better composition is simply taking more
photos<00:01:54.090> and<00:01:54.590> looking<00:01:55.590> at<00:01:55.710> more<00:01:55.829> photos<00:01:56.189> you'll

00:01:56.840 --> 00:01:56.850 
photos and looking at more photos you'll

00:01:56.850 --> 00:01:58.969 
photos and looking at more photos you'll
