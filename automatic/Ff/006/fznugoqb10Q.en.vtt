maps in the multiplayer game that allow

00:01:28.110 --> 00:01:30.679 
maps in the multiplayer game that allow
us<00:01:28.259> to<00:01:28.380> do<00:01:28.500> exactly<00:01:28.829> that<00:01:29.240> now<00:01:30.240> moving<00:01:30.540> on

00:01:30.679 --> 00:01:30.689 
us to do exactly that now moving on

00:01:30.689 --> 00:01:32.420 
us to do exactly that now moving on
we've<00:01:30.840> got<00:01:30.869> a<00:01:31.049> soldier<00:01:31.500> with<00:01:31.619> a<00:01:31.740> bionic<00:01:32.250> arm

00:01:32.420 --> 00:01:32.430 
we've got a soldier with a bionic arm

00:01:32.430 --> 00:01:34.340 
we've got a soldier with a bionic arm
that<00:01:32.820> actually<00:01:33.210> turns<00:01:33.479> into<00:01:33.600> a<00:01:33.780> turret<00:01:34.200> and

00:01:34.340 --> 00:01:34.350 
that actually turns into a turret and

00:01:34.350 --> 00:01:36.499 
that actually turns into a turret and
just<00:01:34.530> completely<00:01:35.009> destroys<00:01:35.460> the<00:01:35.610> enemy<00:01:35.970> so

00:01:36.499 --> 00:01:36.509 
just completely destroys the enemy so

00:01:36.509 --> 00:01:38.149 
just completely destroys the enemy so
