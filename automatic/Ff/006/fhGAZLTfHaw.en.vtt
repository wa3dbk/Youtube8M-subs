00:05:57.850 --> 00:06:00.000 
creeper but it's still creepin on unless
now<00:05:58.630> in<00:05:58.780> my<00:05:58.930> opinion<00:05:59.350> I<00:05:59.500> don't<00:05:59.530> really

00:06:00.000 --> 00:06:00.010 
now in my opinion I don't really

00:06:00.010 --> 00:06:02.190 
now in my opinion I don't really
understand<00:06:00.430> why<00:06:00.730> it<00:06:01.300> explodes<00:06:01.810> because

00:06:02.190 --> 00:06:02.200 
understand why it explodes because

00:06:02.200 --> 00:06:05.340 
understand why it explodes because
seeing<00:06:02.740> that<00:06:02.950> it's<00:06:03.130> a<00:06:03.250> pig<00:06:03.750> pigs<00:06:04.750> are<00:06:04.960> usually

00:06:05.340 --> 00:06:05.350 
seeing that it's a pig pigs are usually

00:06:05.350 --> 00:06:08.660 
seeing that it's a pig pigs are usually
friendly<00:06:05.650> not<00:06:06.370> really<00:06:07.030> that<00:06:07.690> ominous

00:06:08.660 --> 00:06:08.670 
friendly not really that ominous

00:06:08.670 --> 00:06:12.120 
friendly not really that ominous
villainous<00:06:09.670> type<00:06:10.030> to<00:06:10.360> kill<00:06:10.690> you<00:06:10.900> but<00:06:11.680> I<00:06:11.740> guess

00:06:12.120 --> 00:06:12.130 
villainous type to kill you but I guess

00:06:12.130 --> 00:06:15.240

you know it's a creeper and I guess it's

00:06:15.250 --> 00:06:16.680
