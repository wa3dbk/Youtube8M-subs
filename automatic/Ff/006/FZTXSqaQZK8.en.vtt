to<00:03:02.459> do<00:03:02.580> that<00:03:02.700> with<00:03:02.849> this<00:03:03.030> particular<00:03:03.209> model

00:03:03.710 --> 00:03:03.720 
to do that with this particular model

00:03:03.720 --> 00:03:06.530 
to do that with this particular model
ps2<00:03:04.349> I<00:03:04.379> know<00:03:04.590> I've<00:03:04.769> had<00:03:04.890> some<00:03:05.099> people<00:03:05.540> like

to<00:03:08.670> get<00:03:08.910> their<00:03:09.060> discs<00:03:09.299> to<00:03:09.480> work<00:03:09.660> or<00:03:09.870> the<00:03:10.170> disc

00:03:10.370 --> 00:03:10.380 
to get their discs to work or the disc

00:03:10.380 --> 00:03:13.550 
to get their discs to work or the disc
work<00:03:10.739> but<00:03:11.160> it<00:03:11.519> had<00:03:12.090> like<00:03:12.269> slow<00:03:12.780> down<00:03:13.049> and<00:03:13.290> lag

00:03:13.550 --> 00:03:13.560 
work but it had like slow down and lag

00:03:13.560 --> 00:03:16.160 
work but it had like slow down and lag
or<00:03:14.040> really<00:03:14.670> long<00:03:14.849> load<00:03:15.180> times<00:03:15.209> or<00:03:15.870> problems

or really long load times or problems

00:03:16.170 --> 00:03:18.229 
or really long load times or problems
like<00:03:16.290> that<00:03:16.530> and<00:03:16.799> if<00:03:17.579> they're<00:03:17.730> experiencing

00:03:18.229 --> 00:03:18.239 
like that and if they're experiencing

00:03:18.239 --> 00:03:19.699 
like that and if they're experiencing
those<00:03:18.390> problems<00:03:18.810> with<00:03:18.959> this<00:03:19.290> particular

00:03:19.699 --> 00:03:19.709 
those problems with this particular

00:03:19.709 --> 00:03:23.420 
those problems with this particular
model<00:03:20.430> of<00:03:20.760> ps2<00:03:21.090> that<00:03:21.650> doesn't<00:03:22.650> surprise<00:03:23.099> me<00:03:23.129> as

00:03:23.420 --> 00:03:23.430 
model of ps2 that doesn't surprise me as

00:03:23.430 --> 00:03:26.750 
model of ps2 that doesn't surprise me as
much<00:03:23.670> fun<00:03:23.940> way<00:03:25.010> maybe<00:03:26.010> it's<00:03:26.190> not<00:03:26.400> even<00:03:26.610> this

00:03:26.750 --> 00:03:26.760 
much fun way maybe it's not even this

00:03:26.760 --> 00:03:29.390 
much fun way maybe it's not even this
particular<00:03:27.329> model<00:03:27.660> of<00:03:27.989> ps2<00:03:28.290> but<00:03:28.680> just<00:03:28.860> the<00:03:28.980> ps2

00:03:29.390 --> 00:03:29.400 
particular model of ps2 but just the ps2

00:03:29.400 --> 00:03:31.729 
particular model of ps2 but just the ps2
itself<00:03:29.819> maybe<00:03:30.000> the<00:03:30.209> laser<00:03:30.510> is<00:03:30.690> not<00:03:31.049> in<00:03:31.260> tip-top

00:03:31.729 --> 00:03:31.739 
itself maybe the laser is not in tip-top

00:03:31.739 --> 00:03:34.729 
itself maybe the laser is not in tip-top
shape<00:03:32.010> whereas<00:03:32.849> the<00:03:33.060> laser<00:03:33.269> in<00:03:33.540> my<00:03:33.569> fat<00:03:34.049> ps2<00:03:34.379> is

00:03:34.729 --> 00:03:34.739 
shape whereas the laser in my fat ps2 is

00:03:34.739 --> 00:03:36.979 
shape whereas the laser in my fat ps2 is
or<00:03:34.920> something<00:03:35.250> I<00:03:35.430> know<00:03:35.940> my<00:03:36.269> patched<00:03:36.569> disc

00:03:36.979 --> 00:03:36.989 
or something I know my patched disc

00:03:36.989 --> 00:03:38.870 
or something I know my patched disc
worked<00:03:37.290> perfectly<00:03:37.859> well<00:03:38.190> with<00:03:38.400> the<00:03:38.579> slim

00:03:38.870 --> 00:03:38.880 
worked perfectly well with the slim

00:03:38.880 --> 00:03:41.420 
worked perfectly well with the slim
silver<00:03:39.510> ps2<00:03:39.989> I<00:03:40.019> used<00:03:40.410> and<00:03:40.680> I<00:03:40.739> had<00:03:40.889> the<00:03:41.010> exact

00:03:41.420 --> 00:03:41.430 
silver ps2 I used and I had the exact

00:03:41.430 --> 00:03:45.229 
silver ps2 I used and I had the exact
same<00:03:41.549> SC<00:03:42.329> ph<00:03:42.690> number<00:03:42.989> so<00:03:43.850> not<00:03:44.850> sure<00:03:45.000> what<00:03:45.150> the

00:03:45.229 --> 00:03:45.239 
same SC ph number so not sure what the

00:03:45.239 --> 00:03:48.800 
same SC ph number so not sure what the
deal<00:03:45.359> is<00:03:45.420> here<00:03:45.959> but<00:03:46.200> uh<00:03:46.760> well<00:03:47.760> as<00:03:48.150> long<00:03:48.600> as<00:03:48.630> I

00:03:48.800 --> 00:03:48.810 
deal is here but uh well as long as I

00:03:48.810 --> 00:03:50.479 
deal is here but uh well as long as I
can't<00:03:49.139> think<00:03:49.410> of<00:03:49.500> any<00:03:49.620> way<00:03:49.739> to<00:03:49.769> fix<00:03:50.069> this<00:03:50.310> I

00:03:50.479 --> 00:03:50.489 
can't think of any way to fix this I

00:03:50.489 --> 00:03:52.430 
can't think of any way to fix this I
guess<00:03:50.670> I'm<00:03:51.000> just<00:03:51.239> gonna<00:03:51.450> end<00:03:51.690> this<00:03:51.959> video<00:03:52.230> here

00:03:52.430 --> 00:03:52.440 
guess I'm just gonna end this video here

00:03:52.440 --> 00:03:56.000 
guess I'm just gonna end this video here
on<00:03:52.829> that<00:03:53.160> note<00:03:53.430> and<00:03:53.459> I<00:03:54.680> suppose<00:03:55.680> I'll<00:03:55.829> still

00:03:56.000 --> 00:03:56.010 
on that note and I suppose I'll still

00:03:56.010 --> 00:03:57.319 
on that note and I suppose I'll still
upload<00:03:56.370> this<00:03:56.489> because<00:03:56.790> even<00:03:57.030> though<00:03:57.090> it's<00:03:57.239> not

00:03:57.319 --> 00:03:57.329 
upload this because even though it's not

00:03:57.329 --> 00:03:59.479 
upload this because even though it's not
quite<00:03:57.690> as<00:03:57.810> helpful<00:03:58.079> as<00:03:58.319> my<00:03:58.560> other<00:03:58.769> videos<00:03:59.160> it's

00:03:59.479 --> 00:03:59.489 
quite as helpful as my other videos it's

00:03:59.489 --> 00:04:02.150 
quite as helpful as my other videos it's
still<00:03:59.880> nice<00:04:00.540> perhaps<00:04:01.079> to<00:04:01.260> document<00:04:01.799> the<00:04:01.950> fact

00:04:02.150 --> 00:04:02.160 
still nice perhaps to document the fact

00:04:02.160 --> 00:04:06.080 
still nice perhaps to document the fact
that<00:04:02.310> this<00:04:02.849> particular<00:04:03.389> ps2<00:04:04.669> might<00:04:05.669> have

00:04:06.080 --> 00:04:06.090 
that this particular ps2 might have

00:04:06.090 --> 00:04:09.080 
that this particular ps2 might have
problems<00:04:06.599> that<00:04:07.169> other<00:04:07.410> models<00:04:08.010> might<00:04:08.430> not<00:04:08.760> and

00:04:09.080 --> 00:04:09.090 
problems that other models might not and

00:04:09.090 --> 00:04:10.699 
problems that other models might not and
it<00:04:09.299> might<00:04:09.480> be<00:04:09.599> good<00:04:09.780> to<00:04:09.840> keep<00:04:10.109> that<00:04:10.319> in<00:04:10.380> mind

00:04:10.699 --> 00:04:10.709 
it might be good to keep that in mind

00:04:10.709 --> 00:04:13.250 
it might be good to keep that in mind
not<00:04:11.639> sure<00:04:11.849> what<00:04:11.970> the<00:04:12.060> problem<00:04:12.239> is<00:04:12.510> maybe<00:04:12.989> the

00:04:13.250 --> 00:04:13.260 
not sure what the problem is maybe the

00:04:13.260 --> 00:04:14.870 
not sure what the problem is maybe the
laser<00:04:13.440> is<00:04:13.590> not<00:04:13.769> in<00:04:13.889> good<00:04:14.040> shape<00:04:14.099> maybe<00:04:14.669> it's

00:04:14.870 --> 00:04:14.880 
laser is not in good shape maybe it's

00:04:14.880 --> 00:04:17.629 
laser is not in good shape maybe it's
the<00:04:15.000> model<00:04:15.299> of<00:04:15.419> ps2<00:04:16.099> maybe<00:04:17.099> this<00:04:17.340> particular

00:04:17.629 --> 00:04:17.639 
the model of ps2 maybe this particular

00:04:17.639 --> 00:04:21.129 
the model of ps2 maybe this particular
model<00:04:17.970> of<00:04:18.209> ps2<00:04:18.510> doesn't<00:04:19.229> agree<00:04:19.650> with<00:04:19.769> the

00:04:21.129 --> 00:04:21.139 
model of ps2 doesn't agree with the

00:04:21.139 --> 00:04:24.589 
model of ps2 doesn't agree with the
brand<00:04:22.139> of<00:04:22.470> disc<00:04:22.919> that<00:04:23.400> I'm<00:04:23.669> using<00:04:23.940> even<00:04:24.389> though

00:04:24.589 --> 00:04:24.599 
brand of disc that I'm using even though

00:04:24.599 --> 00:04:26.210 
brand of disc that I'm using even though
it<00:04:24.780> worked<00:04:24.990> fine<00:04:25.229> for<00:04:25.289> the<00:04:25.620> other<00:04:25.740> ones<00:04:25.950> I

00:04:26.210 --> 00:04:26.220 
it worked fine for the other ones I

00:04:26.220 --> 00:04:29.810 
it worked fine for the other ones I
don't<00:04:26.820> know<00:04:27.050> but<00:04:28.050> uh<00:04:28.500> yeah<00:04:29.250> that's<00:04:29.520> pretty

00:04:29.810 --> 00:04:29.820 
don't know but uh yeah that's pretty

00:04:29.820 --> 00:04:32.930 
don't know but uh yeah that's pretty
much<00:04:29.940> that<00:04:30.889> sorry<00:04:31.889> it<00:04:32.070> can't<00:04:32.190> be<00:04:32.430> more<00:04:32.639> helpful

00:04:32.930 --> 00:04:32.940 
much that sorry it can't be more helpful

00:04:32.940 --> 00:04:36.379 
much that sorry it can't be more helpful
