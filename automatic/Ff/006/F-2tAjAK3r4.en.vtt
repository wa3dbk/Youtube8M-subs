00:00:20.910 --> 00:00:27.390
 I prepared a ribbed border no no 

00:00:23.279 --> 00:00:30.720
 no I put it into work 

00:00:27.390 --> 00:00:38.610
 all the trusted 228 to better say I have 

00:00:30.720 --> 00:00:39.960
 put 123 is a still viscous strand 

00:00:38.610 --> 00:00:41.910
 close 

00:00:39.960 --> 00:00:45.110
 clearly this that the coasts worked 

00:00:41.910 --> 00:00:45.110
 at 22 

00:00:45.470 --> 00:00:51.510
 attention two are fine but if 

00:00:49.290 --> 00:00:54.540
 we think we work on all the years is 

00:00:51.510 --> 00:00:56.730
 impossible would not make it would come 

00:00:54.540 --> 00:01:00.090
 one thing really that in the third quarter 

00:00:56.730 --> 00:01:03.210
 around the cart is not good here I have 

00:01:00.090 --> 00:01:06.690
 put wire salaries 

00:01:03.210 --> 00:01:13.020
 we hope that they are already of a tea of 

00:01:06.690 --> 00:01:15.930
 flush with the three charges in the morning up 

00:01:13.020 --> 00:01:21.450
 a take-up there are click and 

00:01:15.930 --> 00:01:24.450
 on the other only one so that so now 

00:01:21.450 --> 00:01:27.179
 for me it will be very easy to get rid of 

00:01:24.450 --> 00:01:31.759
 boss in excess I do nothing but 

00:01:27.179 --> 00:01:31.759
 take it out of the peck until we see 

00:01:32.240 --> 00:01:39.929
 here I pull it out of the table I know which one 

00:01:36.509 --> 00:01:46.979
 I start from the wire tensioner and get out of it 

00:01:39.929 --> 00:01:50.970
 out of them a little I stop waiting until 

00:01:46.979 --> 00:01:52.759
 to the other free I remain with only heads 

00:01:50.970 --> 00:01:56.310
 which I need for the double bed 

00:01:52.759 --> 00:01:59.340
 I slide this between the two 

00:01:56.310 --> 00:02:03.509
 future therefore practically eva out 

00:01:59.340 --> 00:02:05.429
 processing this point is not so 

00:02:03.509 --> 00:02:08.390
 simple when there is talk 

00:02:05.429 --> 00:02:08.390
 camera 

00:02:08.789 --> 00:02:13.920
 in extreme extreme evils remedies then pulled 

00:02:12.360 --> 00:02:16.370
 down with break 

00:02:13.920 --> 00:02:20.760
 now I'm ready I just have to set 

00:02:16.370 --> 00:02:23.530
 maybe at this point I carry on or with 

00:02:20.760 --> 00:02:26.110
 a hand or with 

00:02:23.530 --> 00:02:28.120
 separators as well timer on 

00:02:26.110 --> 00:02:32.970
 every day I prepare to work on 

00:02:28.120 --> 00:02:43.690
 all the genes and I do the same thing 

00:02:32.970 --> 00:02:47.650
 also from here it is if we can issue 

00:02:43.690 --> 00:02:51.760
 common simple or no maneuvering in cases 

00:02:47.650 --> 00:02:55.390
 on easel he is preparing now what it is 

00:02:51.760 --> 00:02:57.489
 the variant on all machines la 

00:02:55.390 --> 00:03:00.310
 variant and how well you know so needles 

00:02:57.489 --> 00:03:03.820
 they are frontal become frontal so 

00:03:00.310 --> 00:03:10.709
 we need to bring the car 

00:03:03.820 --> 00:03:13.660
 Front needle bed to needles, and we do 

00:03:10.709 --> 00:03:15.550
 bringing the rivet on h 

00:03:13.660 --> 00:03:19.630
 how well do you know look what happens 

00:03:15.550 --> 00:03:24.640
 h 

00:03:19.630 --> 00:03:26.860
 always stays on five I have for that 

00:03:24.640 --> 00:03:29.739
 that I need is a hat or the 

00:03:26.860 --> 00:03:32.130
 mounted the color change with another 

00:03:29.739 --> 00:03:35.160
 color ready for what I have to do 

00:03:32.130 --> 00:03:37.660
 At this point I can make two choices 

00:03:35.160 --> 00:03:41.200
 carts are all at rest then 

00:03:37.660 --> 00:03:42.549
 all on plane and nl no key in 

00:03:41.200 --> 00:03:47.320
 processing 

00:03:42.549 --> 00:03:48.400
 I can make the transition by taking everything 

00:03:47.320 --> 00:03:51.100
 the thread 

00:03:48.400 --> 00:03:53.200
 or make two tubular turns first 

00:03:51.100 --> 00:03:55.959
 that help me take the thread from here 

00:03:53.200 --> 00:03:59.650
 and from there to you the choice I make you 

00:03:55.959 --> 00:04:02.320
 see we can do this work on a 

00:03:59.650 --> 00:04:05.290
 set the tubular c is very open 

00:04:02.320 --> 00:04:07.420
 of each car at the beginning when 

00:04:05.290 --> 00:04:09.280
 start a very common non-selvedge 

00:04:07.420 --> 00:04:11.710
 nothing changes 

00:04:09.280 --> 00:04:14.650
 and in this case 

00:04:11.710 --> 00:04:21.580
 the machine will work take on the needles 

00:04:14.650 --> 00:04:26.830
 absolute first here and there outside 

00:04:21.580 --> 00:04:30.520
 di pietro will turn on the jump a little bit 

00:04:26.830 --> 00:04:32.200
 but in any case this system is a 

00:04:30.520 --> 00:04:34.440
 a little more sustained since a 

00:04:32.200 --> 00:04:38.170
 I prefer the hat but you can too 

00:04:34.440 --> 00:04:41.440
 after making it issued in processing 

00:04:38.170 --> 00:04:44.010
 all the needles do just that 

00:04:41.440 --> 00:04:44.010
 empty carts 

00:04:44.260 --> 00:04:51.040
 pass the cart if this happens to you 

00:04:47.110 --> 00:04:56.050
 processing machine takes over the 

00:04:51.040 --> 00:04:59.920
 link this point to my needs 

00:04:56.050 --> 00:05:02.350
 I need to react an obvious thing 

00:04:59.920 --> 00:05:05.280
 which I didn't do because I was focused 

00:05:02.350 --> 00:05:08.620
 on the camera always raise the 

00:05:05.280 --> 00:05:12.310
 tension if you think it lowers in 

00:05:08.620 --> 00:05:17.140
 my case the four heads coasts like this 

00:05:12.310 --> 00:05:19.750
 228 worked fine at 2 ma 

00:05:17.140 --> 00:05:23.500
 definitely for the tubular though 

00:05:19.750 --> 00:05:27.250
 I stayed with the three heads is good 

00:05:23.500 --> 00:05:28.930
 change to three by type of processing 

00:05:27.250 --> 00:05:31.840
 however, by taking samples, you can 

00:05:28.930 --> 00:05:34.840
 everyone will come and I will work now 

00:05:31.840 --> 00:05:38.500
 with the card and then I'll show you to the 

00:05:34.840 --> 00:05:41.710
 end as simple to use or 

00:05:38.500 --> 00:05:44.400
 we can also see it together to find 

00:05:41.710 --> 00:05:44.400
 the board
