00:00:00.500 --> 00:00:03.260 

okay<00:00:01.500> so<00:00:01.560> I<00:00:01.709> picked<00:00:01.949> up<00:00:02.070> some<00:00:02.250> J<00:00:02.610> bends<00:00:03.120> and

00:00:03.260 --> 00:00:03.270 
okay so I picked up some J bends and

00:00:03.270 --> 00:00:04.400 
okay so I picked up some J bends and
some<00:00:03.750> u<00:00:03.959> bends

00:00:04.400 --> 00:00:04.410 
some u bends

00:00:04.410 --> 00:00:07.340 
some u bends
these<00:00:05.220> are<00:00:05.430> mandrel<00:00:06.060> bent<00:00:06.299> tubing<00:00:06.480> pieces<00:00:07.140> and

00:00:07.340 --> 00:00:07.350 
these are mandrel bent tubing pieces and

00:00:07.350 --> 00:00:09.950 
these are mandrel bent tubing pieces and
I'm<00:00:08.099> going<00:00:08.160> to<00:00:08.280> cut<00:00:08.490> these<00:00:08.639> into<00:00:08.880> all<00:00:09.570> kinds<00:00:09.870> of

00:00:09.950 --> 00:00:09.960 
I'm going to cut these into all kinds of

00:00:09.960 --> 00:00:12.530 
I'm going to cut these into all kinds of
different<00:00:10.160> lengths<00:00:11.160> and<00:00:11.370> I'll<00:00:12.150> be<00:00:12.269> able<00:00:12.330> to

00:00:12.530 --> 00:00:12.540 
different lengths and I'll be able to

00:00:12.540 --> 00:00:14.270 
different lengths and I'll be able to
build<00:00:12.719> my<00:00:12.900> exhaust<00:00:13.259> system<00:00:13.650> here<00:00:13.830> for<00:00:14.130> the

00:00:14.270 --> 00:00:14.280 
build my exhaust system here for the

00:00:14.280 --> 00:00:18.650 
build my exhaust system here for the
sand<00:00:14.639> rail<00:00:14.849> project<00:00:15.330> in<00:00:16.289> future<00:00:17.010> video<00:00:17.310> but<00:00:17.660> so

00:00:18.650 --> 00:00:18.660 
sand rail project in future video but so

00:00:18.660 --> 00:00:20.090 
sand rail project in future video but so
today's<00:00:19.080> project<00:00:19.380> we're<00:00:19.770> going<00:00:19.859> to<00:00:19.949> have<00:00:20.070> a

00:00:20.090 --> 00:00:20.100 
today's project we're going to have a

00:00:20.100 --> 00:00:22.189 
today's project we're going to have a
look<00:00:20.369> at<00:00:20.550> this<00:00:20.850> electric<00:00:21.420> supercharger

00:00:22.189 --> 00:00:22.199 
look at this electric supercharger

00:00:22.199 --> 00:00:23.450 
look at this electric supercharger
brand-new<00:00:22.859> in-the-box

00:00:23.450 --> 00:00:23.460 
brand-new in-the-box

00:00:23.460 --> 00:00:27.080 
brand-new in-the-box
never<00:00:23.880> been<00:00:24.090> installed<00:00:25.279> so<00:00:26.279> I<00:00:26.310> really<00:00:26.849> doubt

00:00:27.080 --> 00:00:27.090 
never been installed so I really doubt

00:00:27.090 --> 00:00:30.169 
never been installed so I really doubt
the<00:00:27.480> claims<00:00:28.019> of<00:00:28.320> added<00:00:29.220> horsepower<00:00:29.460> that<00:00:30.029> come

00:00:30.169 --> 00:00:30.179 
the claims of added horsepower that come

00:00:30.179 --> 00:00:32.120 
the claims of added horsepower that come
along<00:00:30.420> with<00:00:30.660> an<00:00:30.840> electric<00:00:31.260> supercharger<00:00:31.980> like

00:00:32.120 --> 00:00:32.130 
along with an electric supercharger like

00:00:32.130 --> 00:00:35.240 
along with an electric supercharger like
this<00:00:32.660> there<00:00:33.660> was<00:00:33.750> a<00:00:33.780> guy<00:00:33.989> on<00:00:34.020> YouTube<00:00:34.500> he<00:00:34.710> dyno

00:00:35.240 --> 00:00:35.250 
this there was a guy on YouTube he dyno

00:00:35.250 --> 00:00:38.240 
this there was a guy on YouTube he dyno
tested<00:00:35.880> his<00:00:36.030> car<00:00:36.410> with<00:00:37.410> and<00:00:37.680> without<00:00:37.800> an

00:00:38.240 --> 00:00:38.250 
tested his car with and without an

00:00:38.250 --> 00:00:39.709 
tested his car with and without an
electric<00:00:38.489> supercharger<00:00:39.390> and<00:00:39.450> it<00:00:39.600> actually

00:00:39.709 --> 00:00:39.719 
electric supercharger and it actually

00:00:39.719 --> 00:00:42.229 
electric supercharger and it actually
made<00:00:40.020> less<00:00:40.350> power<00:00:40.649> after<00:00:41.550> he<00:00:41.670> installed<00:00:42.059> it

00:00:42.229 --> 00:00:42.239 
made less power after he installed it

00:00:42.239 --> 00:00:45.229 
made less power after he installed it
and<00:00:42.420> that's<00:00:43.110> that's<00:00:44.010> primarily<00:00:44.550> because<00:00:44.850> it's

00:00:45.229 --> 00:00:45.239 
and that's that's primarily because it's

00:00:45.239 --> 00:00:48.020 
and that's that's primarily because it's
just<00:00:45.480> it's<00:00:45.989> in<00:00:46.260> the<00:00:46.410> way<00:00:46.559> it<00:00:46.890> just<00:00:47.129> it<00:00:47.730> can't

00:00:48.020 --> 00:00:48.030 
just it's in the way it just it can't

00:00:48.030 --> 00:00:49.729 
just it's in the way it just it can't
move<00:00:48.270> enough<00:00:48.629> air<00:00:48.750> and<00:00:49.200> it's<00:00:49.320> just<00:00:49.530> like<00:00:49.710> a

00:00:49.729 --> 00:00:49.739 
move enough air and it's just like a

00:00:49.739 --> 00:00:52.160 
move enough air and it's just like a
restriction<00:00:50.250> and<00:00:50.629> so<00:00:51.629> let's<00:00:51.809> get<00:00:51.960> this<00:00:52.110> thing

00:00:52.160 --> 00:00:52.170 
restriction and so let's get this thing

00:00:52.170 --> 00:00:55.220 
restriction and so let's get this thing
on<00:00:52.379> the<00:00:52.440> workbench<00:00:52.949> and<00:00:53.219> do<00:00:53.430> some<00:00:53.699> testing<00:00:54.230> so

00:00:55.220 --> 00:00:55.230 
on the workbench and do some testing so

00:00:55.230 --> 00:00:57.979 
on the workbench and do some testing so
a<00:00:55.260> 12<00:00:55.590> volt<00:00:55.890> and<00:00:56.100> on<00:00:57.030> the<00:00:57.120> inside<00:00:57.420> you<00:00:57.629> can<00:00:57.660> see

00:00:57.979 --> 00:00:57.989 
a 12 volt and on the inside you can see

00:00:57.989 --> 00:01:00.680 
a 12 volt and on the inside you can see
that<00:00:58.199> plastic<00:00:58.469> squirrel<00:00:59.070> cage<00:00:59.309> fan<00:00:59.609> right<00:01:00.510> in

00:01:00.680 --> 00:01:00.690 
that plastic squirrel cage fan right in

00:01:00.690 --> 00:01:03.619 
that plastic squirrel cage fan right in
there<00:01:01.160> so<00:01:02.160> here's<00:01:02.399> the<00:01:02.579> first<00:01:02.730> clue<00:01:03.149> that<00:01:03.180> this

00:01:03.619 --> 00:01:03.629 
there so here's the first clue that this

00:01:03.629 --> 00:01:04.820 
there so here's the first clue that this
thing<00:01:03.809> probably<00:01:04.229> is<00:01:04.320> not<00:01:04.439> going<00:01:04.589> to<00:01:04.680> be<00:01:04.769> able

00:01:04.820 --> 00:01:04.830 
thing probably is not going to be able

00:01:04.830 --> 00:01:06.620 
thing probably is not going to be able
to<00:01:04.949> do<00:01:05.159> much<00:01:05.339> look<00:01:05.880> at<00:01:05.970> the<00:01:06.030> size<00:01:06.360> of<00:01:06.510> these

00:01:06.620 --> 00:01:06.630 
to do much look at the size of these

00:01:06.630 --> 00:01:10.520 
to do much look at the size of these
wires<00:01:07.010> so<00:01:08.010> 12<00:01:08.369> volt<00:01:08.640> requires<00:01:09.510> a<00:01:09.689> pretty<00:01:10.320> good

00:01:10.520 --> 00:01:10.530 
wires so 12 volt requires a pretty good

00:01:10.530 --> 00:01:13.730 
wires so 12 volt requires a pretty good
wire<00:01:10.740> or<00:01:11.040> a<00:01:11.070> cable<00:01:11.549> to<00:01:12.320> operate<00:01:13.320> a<00:01:13.350> motor<00:01:13.619> that

00:01:13.730 --> 00:01:13.740 
wire or a cable to operate a motor that

00:01:13.740 --> 00:01:16.160 
wire or a cable to operate a motor that
does<00:01:14.040> a<00:01:14.070> lot<00:01:14.460> of<00:01:14.520> work<00:01:14.760> like<00:01:15.390> this<00:01:15.600> starter<00:01:15.990> for

00:01:16.160 --> 00:01:16.170 
does a lot of work like this starter for

00:01:16.170 --> 00:01:18.140 
does a lot of work like this starter for
example<00:01:16.590> like<00:01:17.100> when<00:01:17.280> you<00:01:17.369> look<00:01:17.520> at<00:01:17.670> the<00:01:17.759> cables

00:01:18.140 --> 00:01:18.150 
example like when you look at the cables

00:01:18.150 --> 00:01:21.050 
example like when you look at the cables
under<00:01:18.390> the<00:01:18.509> hood<00:01:18.720> of<00:01:18.750> your<00:01:18.869> car<00:01:19.490> 12<00:01:20.490> volt<00:01:20.790> it

00:01:21.050 --> 00:01:21.060 
under the hood of your car 12 volt it

00:01:21.060 --> 00:01:25.429 
under the hood of your car 12 volt it
just<00:01:21.600> can't<00:01:21.890> carry<00:01:22.890> a<00:01:23.189> lot<00:01:23.490> of<00:01:23.520> amperage<00:01:24.119> in<00:01:24.439> a

00:01:25.429 --> 00:01:25.439 
just can't carry a lot of amperage in a

00:01:25.439 --> 00:01:26.990 
just can't carry a lot of amperage in a
small<00:01:25.770> wire<00:01:26.009> so<00:01:26.310> that's<00:01:26.490> why<00:01:26.670> you've<00:01:26.820> got

00:01:26.990 --> 00:01:27.000 
small wire so that's why you've got

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:28.609 
small wire so that's why you've got
those<00:01:27.180> big<00:01:27.479> cables<00:01:28.049> under<00:01:28.259> the<00:01:28.350> hood<00:01:28.500> of<00:01:28.530> your

00:01:28.609 --> 00:01:28.619 
those big cables under the hood of your

00:01:28.619 --> 00:01:31.069 
those big cables under the hood of your
car<00:01:28.710> so<00:01:29.549> have<00:01:29.729> a<00:01:29.759> look<00:01:29.970> we're<00:01:30.930> going<00:01:31.020> to

00:01:31.069 --> 00:01:31.079 
car so have a look we're going to

00:01:31.079 --> 00:01:35.899 
car so have a look we're going to
compare<00:01:32.060> this<00:01:33.060> wire<00:01:33.360> to<00:01:34.170> unknown<00:01:35.009> 16<00:01:35.640> gauge

00:01:35.899 --> 00:01:35.909 
compare this wire to unknown 16 gauge

00:01:35.909 --> 00:01:38.870 
compare this wire to unknown 16 gauge
wire<00:01:35.939> that<00:01:36.420> I<00:01:36.450> have<00:01:36.689> and<00:01:36.990> you<00:01:37.490> can<00:01:38.490> see<00:01:38.700> how

00:01:38.870 --> 00:01:38.880 
wire that I have and you can see how

00:01:38.880 --> 00:01:43.969 
wire that I have and you can see how
small<00:01:39.240> that<00:01:40.040> wire<00:01:41.040> is<00:01:42.290> so<00:01:43.290> I<00:01:43.320> think<00:01:43.590> in<00:01:43.710> the<00:01:43.829> ad

00:01:43.969 --> 00:01:43.979 
small that wire is so I think in the ad

00:01:43.979 --> 00:01:45.950 
small that wire is so I think in the ad
it<00:01:44.369> was<00:01:44.520> talking<00:01:44.820> about<00:01:45.030> this<00:01:45.570> thing<00:01:45.810> would

00:01:45.950 --> 00:01:45.960 
it was talking about this thing would

00:01:45.960 --> 00:01:49.069 
it was talking about this thing would
make<00:01:46.110> 5<00:01:46.380> or<00:01:46.409> 6<00:01:46.770> horsepower<00:01:47.100> and<00:01:47.720> better<00:01:48.720> fuel

00:01:49.069 --> 00:01:49.079 
make 5 or 6 horsepower and better fuel

00:01:49.079 --> 00:01:50.810 
make 5 or 6 horsepower and better fuel
mileage<00:01:49.170> and<00:01:49.680> yadda-yadda

00:01:50.810 --> 00:01:50.820 
mileage and yadda-yadda

00:01:50.820 --> 00:01:52.700 
mileage and yadda-yadda
so<00:01:51.420> this<00:01:51.810> thing<00:01:51.960> is<00:01:52.049> starting<00:01:52.290> to<00:01:52.380> look<00:01:52.500> like<00:01:52.560> a

00:01:52.700 --> 00:01:52.710 
so this thing is starting to look like a

00:01:52.710 --> 00:01:55.069 
so this thing is starting to look like a
leaf<00:01:53.009> blower<00:01:53.220> and<00:01:53.600> I'm<00:01:54.600> going<00:01:54.780> to<00:01:54.810> make<00:01:54.899> an

00:01:55.069 --> 00:01:55.079 
leaf blower and I'm going to make an

00:01:55.079 --> 00:01:57.920 
leaf blower and I'm going to make an
elaborate<00:01:55.530> kind<00:01:56.159> of<00:01:56.250> a<00:01:56.399> snake<00:01:57.240> shape<00:01:57.509> here<00:01:57.780> at

00:01:57.920 --> 00:01:57.930 
elaborate kind of a snake shape here at

00:01:57.930 --> 00:02:00.620 
elaborate kind of a snake shape here at
all<00:01:58.049> this<00:01:58.200> tubing<00:01:58.619> and<00:01:58.979> I'm<00:01:59.130> going<00:01:59.280> to<00:01:59.340> put<00:01:59.630> see

00:02:00.620 --> 00:02:00.630 
all this tubing and I'm going to put see

00:02:00.630 --> 00:02:03.289 
all this tubing and I'm going to put see
I<00:02:00.840> got<00:02:01.079> this<00:02:01.229> one<00:02:01.439> here<00:02:01.740> I<00:02:01.890> got<00:02:02.790> a<00:02:02.820> fitting

00:02:03.289 --> 00:02:03.299 
I got this one here I got a fitting

00:02:03.299 --> 00:02:05.030 
I got this one here I got a fitting
right<00:02:03.570> in<00:02:03.689> there<00:02:03.869> I'm<00:02:04.020> going<00:02:04.110> to<00:02:04.200> put<00:02:04.320> a<00:02:04.350> fuel

00:02:05.030 --> 00:02:05.040 
right in there I'm going to put a fuel

00:02:05.040 --> 00:02:09.430 
right in there I'm going to put a fuel
pressure<00:02:05.310> gauge<00:02:05.460> on<00:02:05.880> the<00:02:05.909> end

00:02:09.430 --> 00:02:09.440 

00:02:09.440 --> 00:02:12.520 

and<00:02:09.560> that<00:02:09.770> is<00:02:09.979> a<00:02:10.010> nice<00:02:10.340> shirt<00:02:11.230> so<00:02:12.230> this<00:02:12.380> is<00:02:12.500> a

00:02:12.520 --> 00:02:12.530 
and that is a nice shirt so this is a

00:02:12.530 --> 00:02:16.300 
and that is a nice shirt so this is a
gauge<00:02:12.770> I<00:02:12.920> want<00:02:13.100> to<00:02:13.160> use<00:02:13.310> and<00:02:14.980> it's<00:02:15.980> really<00:02:16.280> a

00:02:16.300 --> 00:02:16.310 
gauge I want to use and it's really a

00:02:16.310 --> 00:02:18.610 
gauge I want to use and it's really a
fuel<00:02:16.610> pressure<00:02:16.850> gauge<00:02:17.000> but<00:02:17.660> if<00:02:17.750> I<00:02:17.870> put<00:02:18.470> some

00:02:18.610 --> 00:02:18.620 
fuel pressure gauge but if I put some

00:02:18.620 --> 00:02:23.170 
fuel pressure gauge but if I put some
pressure<00:02:18.800> on<00:02:18.980> the<00:02:19.190> end<00:02:21.520> as<00:02:22.520> you<00:02:22.640> can<00:02:22.760> see<00:02:22.880> I<00:02:22.910> can

00:02:23.170 --> 00:02:23.180 
pressure on the end as you can see I can

00:02:23.180 --> 00:02:25.240 
pressure on the end as you can see I can
move<00:02:23.360> it<00:02:23.540> so<00:02:23.870> it'll<00:02:24.050> substitute<00:02:24.710> as<00:02:24.890> an<00:02:25.070> air

00:02:25.240 --> 00:02:25.250 
move it so it'll substitute as an air

00:02:25.250 --> 00:02:27.490 
move it so it'll substitute as an air
pressure<00:02:25.460> gauge<00:02:25.640> here<00:02:26.060> too<00:02:26.240> for<00:02:26.510> like<00:02:27.320> low

00:02:27.490 --> 00:02:27.500 
pressure gauge here too for like low

00:02:27.500 --> 00:02:30.130 
pressure gauge here too for like low
pressure<00:02:28.240> so<00:02:29.240> I<00:02:29.300> glued<00:02:29.570> all<00:02:29.780> the<00:02:29.900> fittings

00:02:30.130 --> 00:02:30.140 
pressure so I glued all the fittings

00:02:30.140 --> 00:02:32.050 
pressure so I glued all the fittings
while<00:02:30.890> with<00:02:31.070> the<00:02:31.190> exception<00:02:31.610> of<00:02:31.670> this<00:02:31.850> one

00:02:32.050 --> 00:02:32.060 
while with the exception of this one

00:02:32.060 --> 00:02:34.230 
while with the exception of this one
here<00:02:32.270> I<00:02:32.300> just<00:02:32.540> duct<00:02:32.870> taped<00:02:33.110> it<00:02:33.260> on<00:02:33.380> there<00:02:33.620> and

00:02:34.230 --> 00:02:34.240 
here I just duct taped it on there and

00:02:34.240 --> 00:02:37.330 
here I just duct taped it on there and
gauge<00:02:35.240> is<00:02:35.450> on<00:02:35.600> there<00:02:35.810> and<00:02:35.990> a<00:02:36.680> little<00:02:36.950> fitting

00:02:37.330 --> 00:02:37.340 
gauge is on there and a little fitting

00:02:37.340 --> 00:02:39.460 
gauge is on there and a little fitting
is<00:02:37.490> right<00:02:37.670> there<00:02:37.930> so<00:02:38.930> certainly<00:02:39.350> look<00:02:39.440> like

00:02:39.460 --> 00:02:39.470 
is right there so certainly look like

00:02:39.470 --> 00:02:42.820 
is right there so certainly look like
some<00:02:39.800> sort<00:02:39.980> of<00:02:40.100> a<00:02:40.220> funky<00:02:40.730> spud<00:02:41.720> gun<00:02:41.990> or<00:02:42.320> maybe<00:02:42.710> a

00:02:42.820 --> 00:02:42.830 
some sort of a funky spud gun or maybe a

00:02:42.830 --> 00:02:45.700 
some sort of a funky spud gun or maybe a
leaf<00:02:43.490> blower<00:02:44.260> but<00:02:45.260> what<00:02:45.440> do<00:02:45.500> you<00:02:45.590> guys<00:02:45.650> think

00:02:45.700 --> 00:02:45.710 
leaf blower but what do you guys think

00:02:45.710 --> 00:02:47.710 
leaf blower but what do you guys think
let's<00:02:46.280> fire<00:02:46.460> this<00:02:46.610> thing<00:02:46.670> up<00:02:46.910> this<00:02:47.450> is<00:02:47.630> the

00:02:47.710 --> 00:02:47.720 
let's fire this thing up this is the

00:02:47.720 --> 00:02:49.990 
let's fire this thing up this is the
power<00:02:47.900> source<00:02:48.260> that<00:02:48.590> I'm<00:02:48.680> going<00:02:48.830> to<00:02:48.890> use<00:02:49.070> shop

00:02:49.990 --> 00:02:50.000 
power source that I'm going to use shop

00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:53.020 
power source that I'm going to use shop
sized<00:02:50.360> battery<00:02:51.110> charger<00:02:51.560> and<00:02:51.820> I'm<00:02:52.820> going<00:02:53.000> to

00:02:53.020 --> 00:02:53.030 
sized battery charger and I'm going to

00:02:53.030 --> 00:02:58.450 
sized battery charger and I'm going to
be<00:02:53.180> using<00:02:53.570> it<00:02:53.690> here<00:02:53.990> on<00:02:54.170> high<00:02:54.650> start<00:02:57.160> okay<00:02:58.160> guys

00:02:58.450 --> 00:02:58.460 
be using it here on high start okay guys

00:02:58.460 --> 00:03:01.080 
be using it here on high start okay guys
ready<00:02:58.700> for<00:02:59.030> the<00:02:59.150> big<00:02:59.390> show

00:03:01.080 --> 00:03:01.090 
ready for the big show

00:03:01.090 --> 00:03:13.849 
ready for the big show
fire<00:03:02.090> this<00:03:02.270> thing<00:03:02.330> up

00:03:13.849 --> 00:03:13.859 

00:03:13.859 --> 00:03:16.770 

so<00:03:14.859> it<00:03:15.159> does<00:03:15.370> create<00:03:15.700> a<00:03:16.120> little<00:03:16.329> bit<00:03:16.569> of<00:03:16.629> a

00:03:16.770 --> 00:03:16.780 
so it does create a little bit of a

00:03:16.780 --> 00:03:20.220 
so it does create a little bit of a
workload<00:03:17.230> to<00:03:17.889> move<00:03:18.340> air<00:03:18.609> around<00:03:19.060> corners<00:03:19.629> so

00:03:20.220 --> 00:03:20.230 
workload to move air around corners so

00:03:20.230 --> 00:03:22.500 
workload to move air around corners so
that's<00:03:20.530> why<00:03:20.709> I<00:03:20.739> created<00:03:20.950> this<00:03:21.489> S<00:03:21.849> shape<00:03:22.209> here

00:03:22.500 --> 00:03:22.510 
that's why I created this S shape here

00:03:22.510 --> 00:03:26.099 
that's why I created this S shape here
and<00:03:22.829> it<00:03:23.829> simulates<00:03:24.129> a<00:03:24.609> little<00:03:25.209> bit<00:03:25.389> what<00:03:25.840> it<00:03:25.989> is

00:03:26.099 --> 00:03:26.109 
and it simulates a little bit what it is

00:03:26.109 --> 00:03:28.949 
and it simulates a little bit what it is
like<00:03:26.349> in<00:03:26.620> manifold<00:03:27.549> because<00:03:28.329> they're<00:03:28.810> not

00:03:28.949 --> 00:03:28.959 
like in manifold because they're not

00:03:28.959 --> 00:03:30.959 
like in manifold because they're not
perfectly<00:03:29.379> straight<00:03:29.500> either<00:03:29.859> not<00:03:30.549> as<00:03:30.670> curved

00:03:30.959 --> 00:03:30.969 
perfectly straight either not as curved

00:03:30.969 --> 00:03:34.050 
perfectly straight either not as curved
as<00:03:31.150> this<00:03:31.329> one<00:03:31.599> but<00:03:32.049> check<00:03:32.319> this<00:03:32.469> out<00:03:32.680> so<00:03:33.370> I'm

00:03:34.050 --> 00:03:34.060 
as this one but check this out so I'm

00:03:34.060 --> 00:03:37.170 
as this one but check this out so I'm
going<00:03:34.239> to<00:03:34.299> plug<00:03:35.139> up<00:03:35.379> this<00:03:35.680> end<00:03:36.010> here<00:03:36.340> while<00:03:36.909> the

00:03:37.170 --> 00:03:37.180 
going to plug up this end here while the

00:03:37.180 --> 00:03:40.170 
going to plug up this end here while the
the<00:03:38.079> blower<00:03:38.620> is<00:03:38.889> running<00:03:39.280> and<00:03:39.430> you're<00:03:40.060> going

00:03:40.170 --> 00:03:40.180 
the blower is running and you're going

00:03:40.180 --> 00:03:42.270 
the blower is running and you're going
to<00:03:40.209> hear<00:03:40.419> the<00:03:40.540> difference<00:03:40.930> in<00:03:41.079> the<00:03:41.290> motor<00:03:42.040> like

00:03:42.270 --> 00:03:42.280 
to hear the difference in the motor like

00:03:42.280 --> 00:03:52.860 
to hear the difference in the motor like
the<00:03:42.400> workload<00:03:42.790> and<00:03:43.030> then<00:03:43.659> look<00:03:44.439> at<00:03:44.560> the<00:03:44.680> gauge

00:03:52.860 --> 00:03:52.870 

00:03:52.870 --> 00:03:55.900 

nothing

00:03:55.900 --> 00:03:55.910 

00:03:55.910 --> 00:03:58.210 

and<00:03:56.060> so<00:03:56.840> now<00:03:56.960> watch<00:03:57.290> this<00:03:57.560> I'll<00:03:57.740> put<00:03:57.920> a<00:03:57.950> rag

00:03:58.210 --> 00:03:58.220 
and so now watch this I'll put a rag

00:03:58.220 --> 00:04:00.460 
and so now watch this I'll put a rag
just<00:03:59.090> to<00:03:59.180> give<00:03:59.360> you<00:03:59.450> an<00:03:59.540> idea<00:03:59.630> how<00:03:59.900> much<00:04:00.050> air<00:04:00.290> is

00:04:00.460 --> 00:04:00.470 
just to give you an idea how much air is

00:04:00.470 --> 00:04:03.730 
just to give you an idea how much air is
actually<00:04:00.620> coming<00:04:01.100> out<00:04:01.160> of<00:04:01.310> this<00:04:01.370> thing<00:04:02.740> you

00:04:03.730 --> 00:04:03.740 
actually coming out of this thing you

00:04:03.740 --> 00:04:08.470 
actually coming out of this thing you
can't<00:04:03.980> even<00:04:04.160> blow<00:04:04.880> that<00:04:05.120> rag<00:04:05.390> away<00:04:07.270> you<00:04:08.270> can

00:04:08.470 --> 00:04:08.480 
can't even blow that rag away you can

00:04:08.480 --> 00:04:10.990 
can't even blow that rag away you can
see<00:04:08.690> a<00:04:08.720> little<00:04:09.110> bit<00:04:09.350> on<00:04:09.500> the<00:04:09.650> rag<00:04:09.830> if<00:04:10.550> I<00:04:10.670> hold<00:04:10.880> it

00:04:10.990 --> 00:04:11.000 
see a little bit on the rag if I hold it

00:04:11.000 --> 00:04:12.790 
see a little bit on the rag if I hold it
like<00:04:11.060> this<00:04:11.180> and<00:04:11.900> it<00:04:12.050> might<00:04:12.200> move<00:04:12.380> the<00:04:12.590> rag<00:04:12.770> a

00:04:12.790 --> 00:04:12.800 
like this and it might move the rag a

00:04:12.800 --> 00:04:16.930 
like this and it might move the rag a
little<00:04:13.190> bit<00:04:13.370> you<00:04:14.150> know<00:04:14.180> but<00:04:15.020> come<00:04:15.290> on<00:04:15.850> you<00:04:16.850> know

00:04:16.930 --> 00:04:16.940 
little bit you know but come on you know

00:04:16.940 --> 00:04:24.840 
little bit you know but come on you know
it's<00:04:17.239> about<00:04:17.360> what<00:04:17.690> I<00:04:17.720> expected

00:04:24.840 --> 00:04:24.850 

00:04:24.850 --> 00:04:28.590 

so<00:04:25.390> the<00:04:25.570> whole<00:04:25.720> idea<00:04:26.080> on<00:04:26.350> a<00:04:26.380> supercharger<00:04:27.600> is

00:04:28.590 --> 00:04:28.600 
so the whole idea on a supercharger is

00:04:28.600 --> 00:04:32.100 
so the whole idea on a supercharger is
to<00:04:28.870> force<00:04:29.200> the<00:04:29.440> air<00:04:29.620> into<00:04:29.980> the<00:04:30.100> engine<00:04:30.870> more<00:04:31.870> so

00:04:32.100 --> 00:04:32.110 
to force the air into the engine more so

00:04:32.110 --> 00:04:33.750 
to force the air into the engine more so
than<00:04:32.350> what<00:04:32.500> just<00:04:32.680> atmospheric<00:04:33.370> pressure<00:04:33.610> can

00:04:33.750 --> 00:04:33.760 
than what just atmospheric pressure can

00:04:33.760 --> 00:04:38.610 
than what just atmospheric pressure can
do<00:04:35.040> and<00:04:36.090> apparently

00:04:38.610 --> 00:04:38.620 
do and apparently

00:04:38.620 --> 00:04:41.660 
do and apparently
this<00:04:38.710> one<00:04:38.889> is<00:04:39.040> just<00:04:39.190> not<00:04:39.280> going<00:04:39.580> to<00:04:39.669> do<00:04:39.790> it

00:04:41.660 --> 00:04:41.670 
this one is just not going to do it

00:04:41.670 --> 00:04:48.280 
this one is just not going to do it
you

00:04:48.280 --> 00:04:48.290 

00:04:48.290 --> 00:04:50.950 

let<00:04:49.040> me<00:04:49.190> start<00:04:49.460> preparing<00:04:49.970> to<00:04:50.270> do<00:04:50.420> this<00:04:50.480> kind

00:04:50.950 --> 00:04:50.960 
let me start preparing to do this kind

00:04:50.960 --> 00:04:52.740 
let me start preparing to do this kind
of

00:04:52.740 --> 00:04:52.750 
of

00:04:52.750 --> 00:04:55.720 
of
you<00:04:53.750> have<00:04:54.050> to<00:04:54.230> make<00:04:54.410> sure<00:04:54.650> it's<00:04:54.890> all<00:04:55.100> the<00:04:55.550> right

00:04:55.720 --> 00:04:55.730 
you have to make sure it's all the right

00:04:55.730 --> 00:06:11.119 
you have to make sure it's all the right
places<00:04:56.050> imagine

00:06:11.119 --> 00:06:11.129 

00:06:11.129 --> 00:06:15.100 

you

00:06:15.100 --> 00:06:15.110 

00:06:15.110 --> 00:06:23.680 

I<00:06:20.200> start<00:06:21.200> the<00:06:21.410> great
