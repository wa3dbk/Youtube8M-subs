here<00:00:14.450> we're<00:00:14.630> looking<00:00:14.660> for<00:00:15.350> the<00:00:15.410> greatest

00:00:15.700 --> 00:00:15.710 
here we're looking for the greatest

00:00:15.710 --> 00:00:18.430 
here we're looking for the greatest
common<00:00:15.830> factor<00:00:16.309> between<00:00:16.340> two<00:00:16.880> numbers<00:00:17.440> seven

00:00:18.430 --> 00:00:18.440 
common factor between two numbers seven

00:00:18.440 --> 00:00:21.580 
common factor between two numbers seven
and<00:00:18.710> twenty<00:00:19.340> five<00:00:20.140> will<00:00:21.140> do<00:00:21.290> this<00:00:21.350> without

00:00:21.580 --> 00:00:21.590 
and twenty five will do this without

00:00:21.590 --> 00:00:24.010 
and twenty five will do this without
calculation<00:00:22.400> by<00:00:22.939> starting<00:00:23.300> with<00:00:23.420> a<00:00:23.450> rectangle

00:00:24.010 --> 00:00:24.020 
calculation by starting with a rectangle

00:00:24.020 --> 00:00:46.240 
calculation by starting with a rectangle
that<00:00:24.140> is<00:00:24.200> something<00:00:24.560> by<00:00:24.710> 25<00:00:44.830> the<00:00:45.830> first<00:00:46.070> thing

00:00:46.240 --> 00:00:46.250 
that is something by 25 the first thing

00:00:46.250 --> 00:00:48.550 
that is something by 25 the first thing
we'll<00:00:46.370> do<00:00:46.520> is<00:00:46.790> draw<00:00:47.480> a<00:00:47.510> largest<00:00:47.900> square<00:00:48.140> we<00:00:48.350> can

00:00:48.550 --> 00:00:48.560 
we'll do is draw a largest square we can

00:00:48.560 --> 00:00:50.980 
we'll do is draw a largest square we can
