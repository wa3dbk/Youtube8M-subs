00:00:00.750 --> 00:00:10.700
 what is the difference let's say strong or 

00:00:04.920 --> 00:00:17.130
 weak maneuvers well also an example of isolation 

00:00:10.700 --> 00:00:23.060
 the plane turns in process 

00:00:17.130 --> 00:00:24.920
 strong maneuvers transverse 

00:00:23.060 --> 00:00:29.039
 components 

00:00:24.920 --> 00:00:33.620
 wrap well affects significantly 

00:00:29.039 --> 00:00:37.200
 its aerodynamic characteristics 

00:00:33.620 --> 00:00:39.710
 in order to solve the problem 

00:00:37.200 --> 00:00:42.210
 about object stability in the sense 

00:00:39.710 --> 00:00:45.920
 predictability you have to build 

00:00:42.210 --> 00:00:47.579
 very full 

00:00:45.920 --> 00:00:52.550
 mathematical model 

00:00:47.579 --> 00:00:57.559
 and if the plane 

00:00:52.550 --> 00:01:02.609
 changes its course and not turn over 

00:00:57.559 --> 00:01:07.560
 through the flight in a very large arc 

00:01:02.609 --> 00:01:11.720
 radius then the transverse components 

00:01:07.560 --> 00:01:14.100
 wrapping will be insignificant it 

00:01:11.720 --> 00:01:18.659
 aerodynamic characteristics will be 

00:01:14.100 --> 00:01:22.710
 close to flying on a direct course due to 

00:01:18.659 --> 00:01:25.439
 this circumstance many elements 

00:01:22.710 --> 00:01:30.119
 complete mathematical model you can 

00:01:25.439 --> 00:01:32.909
 just throw out of the equations and due 

00:01:30.119 --> 00:01:36.979
 simplification of the mathematical model 

00:01:32.909 --> 00:01:40.320
 you reduce the amount of computation 

00:01:36.979 --> 00:01:42.479
 volumes of experiments during the solution 

00:01:40.320 --> 00:01:45.810
 stability problems in the sense of 

00:01:42.479 --> 00:01:48.240
 predictability of behavior that is 

00:01:45.810 --> 00:01:53.659
 separation of maneuvers into strong and weak 

00:01:48.240 --> 00:01:58.009
 it is generally conditional and is associated either with 

00:01:53.659 --> 00:02:01.770
 process perception 

00:01:58.009 --> 00:02:04.140
 passengers by observers either so 

00:02:01.770 --> 00:02:06.110
 you solve the problem of sustainability 

00:02:04.140 --> 00:02:07.320
 control object in the sense of 

00:02:06.110 --> 00:02:12.920
 predictability 

00:02:07.320 --> 00:02:12.920
 behavior and in some cases 

00:02:13.160 --> 00:02:19.260
 those results that are impossible to achieve 

00:02:17.209 --> 00:02:26.100
 strong maneuvers 

00:02:19.260 --> 00:02:30.720
 they are successful in progress 

00:02:26.100 --> 00:02:34.590
 implementations of weak maneuvers 

00:02:30.720 --> 00:02:37.890
 would try somebody at fifty 

00:02:34.590 --> 00:02:44.100
 the third year to give a hint about the fact that in the ussr 

00:02:37.890 --> 00:02:48.570
 need to revive capitalism nothing 

00:02:44.100 --> 00:02:51.840
 would not have happened even in the ninety first 

00:02:48.570 --> 00:02:54.800
 year when was held All-Union 

00:02:51.840 --> 00:02:57.810
 referendum on the fate of the country 

00:02:54.800 --> 00:03:01.560
 referendum initiators don't fable or 

00:02:57.810 --> 00:03:05.040
 put the question explicitly think 

00:03:01.560 --> 00:03:08.580
 whether you need a liquidation 

00:03:05.040 --> 00:03:10.410
 of socialism in the ussr and the transition to 

00:03:08.580 --> 00:03:13.140
 to capitalism 

00:03:10.410 --> 00:03:16.110
 and further to the choice of American Swedish 

00:03:13.140 --> 00:03:17.630
 Germanic or some Nepalese 

00:03:16.110 --> 00:03:21.239
 Ladoga Bank 

00:03:17.630 --> 00:03:26.459
 sample and something else somewhere from 

00:03:21.239 --> 00:03:31.340
 colony level but nonetheless if 

00:03:26.459 --> 00:03:37.110
 count from 53 to the present 

00:03:31.340 --> 00:03:41.670
 capitalism restored all implemented 

00:03:37.110 --> 00:03:44.670
 by weak maneuvers which 

00:03:41.670 --> 00:03:51.360
 most people in general and not 

00:03:44.670 --> 00:03:54.150
 noticed no one noticed how Nikita 

00:03:51.360 --> 00:03:57.150
 Sergeich liquidated to promptly 

00:03:54.150 --> 00:03:59.000
 collective farm artel sector and the whole 

00:03:57.150 --> 00:04:04.019
 property turned into 

00:03:59.000 --> 00:04:06.900
 public sector due to which 

00:04:04.019 --> 00:04:08.920
 was eliminated by structural 

00:04:06.900 --> 00:04:12.730
 component management 

00:04:08.920 --> 00:04:14.280
 in economics and quality management right away 

00:04:12.730 --> 00:04:18.669
 fell 

00:04:14.280 --> 00:04:22.570
 no one noticed as in the constitution 77 

00:04:18.669 --> 00:04:25.620
 years term workers' deputies was 

00:04:22.570 --> 00:04:28.900
 replaced by the term people's deputies 

00:04:25.620 --> 00:04:31.800
 difference what's the difference is that by 

00:04:28.900 --> 00:04:34.870
 Constitution 36 years 

00:04:31.800 --> 00:04:39.120
 only nominees could be deputies 

00:04:34.870 --> 00:04:42.060
 work collectives and the workers themselves 

00:04:39.120 --> 00:04:48.070
 concepts people it includes not only 

00:04:42.060 --> 00:04:51.190
 workers but no parasites 

00:04:48.070 --> 00:04:54.729
 He attached importance to the fact that Ostap 

00:04:51.190 --> 00:05:03.370
 ibrahimovic became a literary character 

00:04:54.729 --> 00:05:06.400
 number one though in general since times 

00:05:03.370 --> 00:05:10.060
 Nikolai Vasilyevich Gogol and dead souls 

00:05:06.400 --> 00:05:13.180
 in general, citizens had to understand 

00:05:10.060 --> 00:05:15.520
 that such subjects as Pavel Ivanovich 

00:05:13.180 --> 00:05:20.110
 Chichikov and Ostap Ibrahimovic 

00:05:15.520 --> 00:05:22.930
 Penza is people much more dangerous than 

00:05:20.110 --> 00:05:25.870
 grand inquisitor dostoevsky which 

00:05:22.930 --> 00:05:29.830
 intellectuals frightened throughout 

00:05:25.870 --> 00:05:34.470
 half a century for the simple reason that 

00:05:29.830 --> 00:05:34.470
 life under the rule of the great inquisitor 

00:05:35.940 --> 00:05:41.440
 has a certain character and 

00:05:38.830 --> 00:05:43.930
 most ordinary people are known for something not 

00:05:41.440 --> 00:05:47.890
 need to do in order to inquisitor 

00:05:43.930 --> 00:05:51.130
 there were no complaints against you 

00:05:47.890 --> 00:05:56.940
 be but they are statistically insignificant 

00:05:51.130 --> 00:06:02.050
 but when the power of the great combinator 

00:05:56.940 --> 00:06:04.750
 that's a completely different power 

00:06:02.050 --> 00:06:07.830
 because with the great combine rum 

00:06:04.750 --> 00:06:11.770
 impossible to agree on the rules of the game 

00:06:07.830 --> 00:06:13.689
 because changing the rules of the game during 

00:06:11.770 --> 00:06:17.349
 games are sorry 

00:06:13.689 --> 00:06:20.559
 combinations and even the great combinator himself 

00:06:17.349 --> 00:06:24.539
 not safe from what will come yet 

00:06:20.559 --> 00:06:27.549
 greater combinators will let him 

00:06:24.539 --> 00:06:29.939
 unknown where and unknown as an example 

00:06:27.549 --> 00:06:32.939
 What the fate of Boris and Abramitch 

00:06:29.939 --> 00:06:32.939
 Berezovsky
