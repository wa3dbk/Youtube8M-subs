take<00:00:04.259> you<00:00:04.440> through<00:00:04.470> a<00:00:04.740> couple<00:00:05.190> of<00:00:05.460> things<00:00:05.640> that

00:00:05.809 --> 00:00:05.819 
take you through a couple of things that

00:00:05.819 --> 00:00:08.660 
take you through a couple of things that
I<00:00:05.940> think<00:00:06.060> is<00:00:06.600> it<00:00:07.200> makes<00:00:07.980> it<00:00:08.220> sets<00:00:08.460> her<00:00:08.580> apart

00:00:08.660 --> 00:00:08.670 
I think is it makes it sets her apart

00:00:08.670 --> 00:00:11.030 
I think is it makes it sets her apart
and<00:00:09.179> is<00:00:09.540> part<00:00:09.840> of<00:00:09.870> our<00:00:10.349> evolution<00:00:10.860> of<00:00:10.980> the

00:00:11.030 --> 00:00:11.040 
and is part of our evolution of the

00:00:11.040 --> 00:00:13.129 
and is part of our evolution of the
fashions<00:00:11.400> all<00:00:11.599> first<00:00:12.599> of<00:00:12.719> all<00:00:12.809> what<00:00:12.960> I<00:00:12.990> even

00:00:13.129 --> 00:00:13.139 
fashions all first of all what I even

00:00:13.139 --> 00:00:15.169 
fashions all first of all what I even
set<00:00:13.410> out<00:00:13.500> to<00:00:13.650> do<00:00:13.769> to<00:00:13.860> sculpt<00:00:14.099> like<00:00:14.190> I<00:00:14.309> say<00:00:14.490> she's

00:00:15.169 --> 00:00:15.179 
set out to do to sculpt like I say she's

00:00:15.179 --> 00:00:17.330 
set out to do to sculpt like I say she's
a<00:00:15.330> she's<00:00:15.780> an<00:00:15.929> arrow<00:00:16.230> or<00:00:16.560> sort<00:00:16.920> of<00:00:17.010> silhouette

00:00:17.330 --> 00:00:17.340 
a she's an arrow or sort of silhouette

00:00:17.340 --> 00:00:21.380 
a she's an arrow or sort of silhouette
and<00:00:17.760> what<00:00:18.420> I<00:00:18.449> mean<00:00:18.630> by<00:00:18.690> that<00:00:18.840> is<00:00:19.199> if<00:00:19.470> you<00:00:20.240> if<00:00:21.240> you

00:00:21.380 --> 00:00:21.390 
and what I mean by that is if you if you

00:00:21.390 --> 00:00:24.800 
and what I mean by that is if you if you
can<00:00:21.570> get<00:00:21.779> the<00:00:21.960> side<00:00:22.619> view<00:00:22.920> here<00:00:22.980> but<00:00:23.449> she<00:00:24.449> felt

00:00:24.800 --> 00:00:24.810 
can get the side view here but she felt

00:00:24.810 --> 00:00:26.810 
can get the side view here but she felt
it<00:00:24.990> was<00:00:25.080> a<00:00:25.109> definite<00:00:25.619> kind<00:00:25.949> of<00:00:26.039> arch<00:00:26.369> to<00:00:26.730> her

00:00:26.810 --> 00:00:26.820 
it was a definite kind of arch to her

00:00:26.820 --> 00:00:28.370 
it was a definite kind of arch to her
back<00:00:27.060> which<00:00:27.510> i<00:00:27.630> think<00:00:27.689> is<00:00:27.900> a<00:00:27.930> very<00:00:28.080> beautiful

00:00:28.370 --> 00:00:28.380 
back which i think is a very beautiful

00:00:28.380 --> 00:00:31.460 
back which i think is a very beautiful
sort<00:00:28.980> of<00:00:29.039> if<00:00:29.310> you<00:00:29.609> get<00:00:29.820> a<00:00:30.179> very<00:00:30.689> beautiful<00:00:30.929> sort

00:00:31.460 --> 00:00:31.470 
sort of if you get a very beautiful sort

00:00:31.470 --> 00:00:34.970 
sort of if you get a very beautiful sort
of<00:00:31.560> curved<00:00:32.660> I<00:00:33.660> think<00:00:34.530> we've<00:00:34.620> done<00:00:34.770> some

00:00:34.970 --> 00:00:34.980 
of curved I think we've done some

00:00:34.980 --> 00:00:36.560 
of curved I think we've done some
improvements<00:00:35.610> to<00:00:35.670> the<00:00:35.790> jointing<00:00:36.239> of<00:00:36.360> course

00:00:36.560 --> 00:00:36.570 
improvements to the jointing of course

00:00:36.570 --> 00:00:39.500 
improvements to the jointing of course
there's<00:00:37.559> always<00:00:37.710> a<00:00:37.800> battle<00:00:38.210> you<00:00:39.210> know<00:00:39.329> the

00:00:39.500 --> 00:00:39.510 
there's always a battle you know the

00:00:39.510 --> 00:00:40.760 
there's always a battle you know the
more<00:00:39.660> joints<00:00:39.989> you<00:00:40.050> put<00:00:40.230> in<00:00:40.350> the<00:00:40.440> more<00:00:40.590> you<00:00:40.620> have

00:00:40.760 --> 00:00:40.770 
more joints you put in the more you have

00:00:40.770 --> 00:00:42.889 
more joints you put in the more you have
to<00:00:40.890> cut<00:00:41.100> the<00:00:41.250> body<00:00:41.430> and<00:00:41.820> and<00:00:42.239> the<00:00:42.329> more<00:00:42.510> you<00:00:42.690> cut

00:00:42.889 --> 00:00:42.899 
to cut the body and and the more you cut

00:00:42.899 --> 00:00:45.229 
to cut the body and and the more you cut
the<00:00:43.020> body<00:00:43.230> you<00:00:43.590> know<00:00:43.820> people<00:00:44.820> like<00:00:45.000> it<00:00:45.149> or

00:00:45.229 --> 00:00:45.239 
the body you know people like it or

00:00:45.239 --> 00:00:47.420 
the body you know people like it or
don't<00:00:45.420> like<00:00:45.510> it<00:00:45.629> I<00:00:45.960> think<00:00:46.620> that<00:00:46.920> the

00:00:47.420 --> 00:00:47.430 
don't like it I think that the

00:00:47.430 --> 00:00:49.639 
don't like it I think that the
collectors<00:00:47.879> pretty<00:00:48.629> much<00:00:48.780> used<00:00:49.020> to<00:00:49.110> the<00:00:49.200> to

00:00:49.639 --> 00:00:49.649 
collectors pretty much used to the to

00:00:49.649 --> 00:00:52.119 
collectors pretty much used to the to
the<00:00:49.770> wrist<00:00:50.039> joint<00:00:50.309> and<00:00:50.640> to<00:00:50.879> the<00:00:50.969> elbow<00:00:51.270> joint

00:00:52.119 --> 00:00:52.129 
the wrist joint and to the elbow joint

00:00:52.129 --> 00:00:55.100 
the wrist joint and to the elbow joint
we've<00:00:53.129> developed<00:00:53.640> this<00:00:53.789> under<00:00:54.660> the<00:00:54.780> bustline

00:00:55.100 --> 00:00:55.110 
we've developed this under the bustline

00:00:55.110 --> 00:00:59.330 
we've developed this under the bustline
that<00:00:55.760> Tyler's<00:00:56.760> had<00:00:57.270> for<00:00:57.629> many<00:00:57.930> years<00:00:58.350> for

00:00:59.330 --> 00:00:59.340 
that Tyler's had for many years for

00:00:59.340 --> 00:01:01.369 
that Tyler's had for many years for
Tyler<00:00:59.820> it<00:01:00.090> was<00:01:00.239> so<00:01:00.420> that<00:01:00.629> the<00:01:00.750> shoulder<00:01:01.199> could

00:01:01.369 --> 00:01:01.379 
Tyler it was so that the shoulder could

00:01:01.379 --> 00:01:03.799 
Tyler it was so that the shoulder could
drop<00:01:01.649> so<00:01:02.399> that<00:01:02.609> there<00:01:02.789> would<00:01:03.090> be<00:01:03.120> moving<00:01:03.449> back

00:01:03.799 --> 00:01:03.809 
drop so that there would be moving back

00:01:03.809 --> 00:01:09.080 
drop so that there would be moving back
and<00:01:03.989> forth<00:01:04.290> like<00:01:04.589> a<00:01:05.549> model<00:01:06.270> sort<00:01:06.510> of<00:01:06.600> thing<00:01:08.090> the

00:01:09.080 --> 00:01:09.090 
and forth like a model sort of thing the

00:01:09.090 --> 00:01:11.120 
and forth like a model sort of thing the
thing<00:01:09.270> that's<00:01:09.510> new<00:01:09.689> about<00:01:09.720> this<00:01:10.170> is<00:01:10.530> we<00:01:10.740> we

00:01:11.120 --> 00:01:11.130 
thing that's new about this is we we

00:01:11.130 --> 00:01:13.730 
thing that's new about this is we we
brought<00:01:11.369> this<00:01:11.580> this<00:01:11.970> part<00:01:12.960> one<00:01:13.200> step<00:01:13.439> forward

00:01:13.730 --> 00:01:13.740 
brought this this part one step forward

00:01:13.740 --> 00:01:15.620 
brought this this part one step forward
it's<00:01:14.520> been<00:01:14.700> engineered<00:01:14.970> so<00:01:15.299> that<00:01:15.330> it<00:01:15.509> goes

00:01:15.620 --> 00:01:15.630 
it's been engineered so that it goes

00:01:15.630 --> 00:01:18.679 
it's been engineered so that it goes
forwards<00:01:16.229> and<00:01:16.500> backwards<00:01:17.270> so<00:01:18.270> she<00:01:18.330> can<00:01:18.540> really

00:01:18.679 --> 00:01:18.689 
forwards and backwards so she can really

00:01:18.689 --> 00:01:21.800 
forwards and backwards so she can really
arch<00:01:18.930> her<00:01:19.140> back<00:01:19.200> or<00:01:19.950> she<00:01:20.880> can<00:01:21.000> do<00:01:21.180> that<00:01:21.299> model

00:01:21.800 --> 00:01:21.810 
arch her back or she can do that model

00:01:21.810 --> 00:01:24.380 
arch her back or she can do that model
for<00:01:22.080> the<00:01:22.200> kind<00:01:22.470> of<00:01:22.680> hunch<00:01:23.280> she<00:01:23.939> can<00:01:24.180> kind<00:01:24.270> of

00:01:24.380 --> 00:01:24.390 
for the kind of hunch she can kind of

00:01:24.390 --> 00:01:26.510 
for the kind of hunch she can kind of
hunched<00:01:24.600> over<00:01:24.780> and<00:01:25.530> it's<00:01:25.890> especially<00:01:26.100> nice

00:01:26.510 --> 00:01:26.520 
hunched over and it's especially nice

00:01:26.520 --> 00:01:33.109 
hunched over and it's especially nice
when<00:01:26.549> she<00:01:26.729> sits<00:01:27.409> because<00:01:28.970> yet<00:01:31.640> other<00:01:32.640> fashion

00:01:33.109 --> 00:01:33.119 
when she sits because yet other fashion

00:01:33.119 --> 00:01:34.399 
when she sits because yet other fashion
dolls<00:01:33.270> we've<00:01:33.450> done<00:01:33.630> when<00:01:33.780> they<00:01:33.900> sit<00:01:34.200> there

00:01:34.399 --> 00:01:34.409 
dolls we've done when they sit there

00:01:34.409 --> 00:01:36.530 
dolls we've done when they sit there
they're<00:01:34.680> ramrod<00:01:35.159> straight<00:01:35.189> and<00:01:35.850> I<00:01:36.240> think<00:01:36.450> the

00:01:36.530 --> 00:01:36.540 
they're ramrod straight and I think the

00:01:36.540 --> 00:01:39.410 
they're ramrod straight and I think the
natural<00:01:37.049> a<00:01:37.229> person<00:01:37.799> naturally<00:01:37.950> wants<00:01:38.189> to<00:01:38.610> come

00:01:39.410 --> 00:01:39.420 
natural a person naturally wants to come

00:01:39.420 --> 00:01:40.819 
natural a person naturally wants to come
forward<00:01:39.750> a<00:01:39.869> little<00:01:40.079> bit<00:01:40.200> or<00:01:40.320> bring<00:01:40.680> their

00:01:40.819 --> 00:01:40.829 
forward a little bit or bring their

00:01:40.829 --> 00:01:42.260 
forward a little bit or bring their
shoulders<00:01:41.159> down<00:01:41.310> a<00:01:41.340> little<00:01:41.490> bit<00:01:41.610> so<00:01:42.060> she's

00:01:42.260 --> 00:01:42.270 
shoulders down a little bit so she's

00:01:42.270 --> 00:01:44.810 
shoulders down a little bit so she's
able<00:01:42.420> to<00:01:42.570> do<00:01:42.810> that<00:01:43.310> another<00:01:44.310> thing<00:01:44.610> that<00:01:44.729> we've

00:01:44.810 --> 00:01:44.820 
able to do that another thing that we've

00:01:44.820 --> 00:01:48.289 
able to do that another thing that we've
done<00:01:44.850> is<00:01:45.420> I<00:01:45.960> change<00:01:46.740> where<00:01:47.159> and<00:01:47.490> how<00:01:47.759> I<00:01:47.790> put<00:01:48.149> the

00:01:48.289 --> 00:01:48.299 
done is I change where and how I put the

00:01:48.299 --> 00:01:51.679 
done is I change where and how I put the
