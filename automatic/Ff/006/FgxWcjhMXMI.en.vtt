the kind of I guess the template for a

00:01:09.090 --> 00:01:10.609 
the kind of I guess the template for a
game<00:01:09.240> like<00:01:09.270> Guild<00:01:09.659> Wars<00:01:09.869> and<00:01:10.140> evolved<00:01:10.530> it

00:01:10.609 --> 00:01:10.619

have<00:03:17.530> to<00:03:17.680> use<00:03:17.830> the<00:03:18.010> emotes<00:03:18.310> system<00:03:18.730> where<00:03:19.090> the

00:03:19.170 --> 00:03:19.180 
have to use the emotes system where the

00:03:19.180 --> 00:03:21.090 
have to use the emotes system where the
players<00:03:19.450> can<00:03:19.690> do<00:03:19.810> specific<00:03:20.290> animations<00:03:20.830> and

00:03:21.090 --> 00:03:21.100 
players can do specific animations and

00:03:21.100 --> 00:03:23.460 
players can do specific animations and
they<00:03:21.760> have<00:03:21.910> to<00:03:22.060> do<00:03:22.150> specific<00:03:22.660> animations<00:03:23.200> on

00:03:23.460 --> 00:03:23.470 
they have to do specific animations on

00:03:23.470 --> 00:03:26.010 
they have to do specific animations on
these<00:03:23.680> pads<00:03:23.980> as<00:03:24.850> you<00:03:24.970> saw<00:03:25.150> there<00:03:25.180> to<00:03:25.480> activate

00:03:26.010 --> 00:03:26.020 
these pads as you saw there to activate

00:03:26.020 --> 00:03:27.780 
these pads as you saw there to activate
the<00:03:26.200> parts<00:03:26.500> of<00:03:26.590> the<00:03:26.680> bridge<00:03:26.890> and<00:03:27.100> it<00:03:27.190> sweeps<00:03:27.459> in

00:03:27.780 --> 00:03:27.790 
the parts of the bridge and it sweeps in

00:03:27.790 --> 00:03:29.820 
the parts of the bridge and it sweeps in
and<00:03:28.000> allows<00:03:28.480> them<00:03:28.660> path<00:03:28.870> but<00:03:29.049> when<00:03:29.500> they<00:03:29.620> step

00:03:29.820 --> 00:03:29.830 
and allows them path but when they step

00:03:29.830 --> 00:03:31.920 
and allows them path but when they step
off<00:03:30.040> the<00:03:30.700> bridge<00:03:30.880> disintegrates<00:03:31.450> again<00:03:31.750> and

00:03:31.920 --> 00:03:31.930 
off the bridge disintegrates again and

00:03:31.930 --> 00:03:34.890 
off the bridge disintegrates again and
they<00:03:32.470> can't<00:03:32.680> get<00:03:32.860> across<00:03:33.299> so<00:03:34.299> the<00:03:34.450> players<00:03:34.720> are

00:03:34.890 --> 00:03:34.900 
they can't get across so the players are

00:03:34.900 --> 00:03:37.229 
they can't get across so the players are
faced<00:03:35.110> with<00:03:35.230> a<00:03:35.350> choice<00:03:35.590> they<00:03:36.580> have<00:03:36.610> to<00:03:36.940> choose

three of their team to activate these

00:03:39.730 --> 00:03:43.140 
three of their team to activate these
pads<00:03:40.090> and<00:03:40.330> stand<00:03:40.959> on<00:03:41.170> that<00:03:41.320> side<00:03:41.620> and<00:03:42.150> then

00:03:43.140 --> 00:03:43.150

tactical choice who do they leave behind

00:03:50.410 --> 00:03:53.759 
tactical choice who do they leave behind

through the dungeon they also have to

00:04:02.019 --> 00:04:03.990 
through the dungeon they also have to
make<00:04:02.170> tactical<00:04:02.410> choices<00:04:02.860> about<00:04:03.310> who<00:04:03.820> they

engage with and in this case it's very
out<00:04:06.310> you<00:04:06.400> know<00:04:06.489> it's<00:04:06.910> a<00:04:07.030> straight<00:04:07.390> choice<00:04:07.600> you

00:04:07.830 --> 00:04:07.840 
out you know it's a straight choice you

00:04:07.840 --> 00:04:09.300 
out you know it's a straight choice you
have<00:04:07.870> to<00:04:07.989> send<00:04:08.200> three<00:04:08.380> people<00:04:08.680> across<00:04:08.829> who<00:04:09.100> you

00:04:09.300 --> 00:04:09.310 
have to send three people across who you

00:04:09.310 --> 00:04:11.430 
have to send three people across who you
send<00:04:09.610> and<00:04:09.850> it'll<00:04:10.329> be<00:04:10.450> based<00:04:10.660> on<00:04:10.840> which<00:04:11.049> you

00:04:11.430 --> 00:04:11.440 
send and it'll be based on which you

00:04:11.440 --> 00:04:13.410 
send and it'll be based on which you
know<00:04:11.530> they'd<00:04:12.160> be<00:04:12.220> better<00:04:12.579> suited<00:04:12.910> based<00:04:13.269> on

00:04:13.410 --> 00:04:13.420 
know they'd be better suited based on

00:04:13.420 --> 00:04:15.600 
know they'd be better suited based on
which<00:04:13.600> of<00:04:13.890> the<00:04:14.890> enemies<00:04:15.250> are<00:04:15.280> on<00:04:15.430> the<00:04:15.519> other

which of the enemies are on the other

00:04:15.610 --> 00:04:16.920 
which of the enemies are on the other
end<00:04:15.820> so<00:04:16.120> there'll<00:04:16.299> also<00:04:16.419> be<00:04:16.570> visual

00:04:16.920 --> 00:04:16.930 
end so there'll also be visual

00:04:16.930 --> 00:04:18.719 
end so there'll also be visual
indicators<00:04:17.380> be<00:04:17.560> at<00:04:17.650> the<00:04:17.739> name<00:04:17.950> of<00:04:18.100> the<00:04:18.220> mob<00:04:18.430> or

that they send across and it's trying to

00:04:29.500 --> 00:04:31.500 
that they send across and it's trying to
pose<00:04:29.890> those<00:04:30.250> interesting<00:04:30.880> choices<00:04:31.120> to<00:04:31.419> the

across and the reason we're doing this

00:04:43.840 --> 00:04:45.720 
across and the reason we're doing this
is<00:04:43.990> as<00:04:44.290> they<00:04:44.680> progress<00:04:44.860> through<00:04:45.070> the<00:04:45.370> dungeon
