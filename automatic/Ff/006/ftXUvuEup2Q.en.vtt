00:00:09.960 --> 00:00:14.340
 to say early and exactly in that 

00:00:12.420 --> 00:00:16.379
 moment where about ten yards from you 

00:00:14.340 --> 00:00:18.150

00:00:16.379 --> 00:00:20.520
 pretend that you did not see you 

00:00:18.150 --> 00:00:22.289
 do you also know how to do such situations ? 

00:00:20.520 --> 00:00:24.269
 people that's me, that's it 

00:00:22.289 --> 00:00:26.910
 so often happens where I think so then 

00:00:24.269 --> 00:00:28.949
 No one up there wants to trade me 

00:00:26.910 --> 00:00:31.500
 say what really upset me 

00:00:28.949 --> 00:00:33.690
 if i know exactly that he is me 

00:00:31.500 --> 00:00:35.550
 has seen and he knows exactly that he 

00:00:33.690 --> 00:00:38.010
 saw me and then me anyway 

00:00:35.550 --> 00:00:39.840
 ignore basically I say everybody 

00:00:38.010 --> 00:00:41.850

00:00:39.840 --> 00:00:44.940
 At least, but just pretend 

00:00:41.850 --> 00:00:47.579
 like being blind is just the way 

00:00:44.940 --> 00:00:49.820
 this one happens to me in bags 

00:00:47.579 --> 00:00:49.820
 is 

00:00:55.000 --> 00:00:59.450
 I mean how stupid it is when you look at yourself 

00:00:57.739 --> 00:01:01.280
 but actually knows but can 

00:00:59.450 --> 00:01:02.900
 at least as smiling or what you give her 

00:01:01.280 --> 00:01:04.519
 rude or can you understand that 

00:01:02.900 --> 00:01:06.770
 then of course nicole already mentioned the 

00:01:04.519 --> 00:01:08.630
 bids situation in the city someone 

00:01:06.770 --> 00:01:10.550
 knows running in the city on you 

00:01:08.630 --> 00:01:12.350
 Today I am pleased already in full commercial to 

00:01:10.550 --> 00:01:14.600

00:01:12.350 --> 00:01:16.550
 one over and you stand there as would 

00:01:14.600 --> 00:01:18.320
 to wave your invisible and full 

00:01:16.550 --> 00:01:20.000
 and makes the so what the first 

00:01:18.320 --> 00:01:23.060
 possibility would be that he was in the moment 

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:25.009
 just do not know what to say or 

00:01:23.060 --> 00:01:29.180
 only too shy to anything to 

00:01:25.009 --> 00:01:30.649

00:01:38.030 --> 00:01:41.810
 Currently I do not see him or he 

00:01:40.430 --> 00:01:44.060
 just did not want to be accurate at the moment 

00:01:41.810 --> 00:01:45.350
 whether it really is the lisa jackets or 

00:01:44.060 --> 00:01:49.220
 Maybe she's just having one 

00:01:45.350 --> 00:01:51.560
 another person confused riesa 

00:01:49.220 --> 00:01:52.940
 I know that's the shit that 

00:01:51.560 --> 00:01:54.649
 I could not look at it anymore 

00:01:52.940 --> 00:01:56.060
 analyze if it is really in this one 

00:01:54.649 --> 00:01:59.630

00:01:56.060 --> 00:02:03.459

 you can smile a bit 

00:02:22.010 --> 00:02:25.840
