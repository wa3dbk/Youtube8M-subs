00:00:01.000 --> 00:00:06.720
As many whanau struggle
to make it work in Australia,

00:00:06.720 --> 00:00:11.120
one Maori family
has returned to Rotorua

00:00:11.120 --> 00:00:16.240
to feed the community
with food and knowledge.

00:00:16.600 --> 00:00:19.880
Fish, seafood,
and even Paua Pies,

00:00:20.560 --> 00:00:22.880
all made to satisfy the community.

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:36.440
It's one of two fish 'n' chip shops
owned by Dorset and his family.

00:00:36.440 --> 00:00:40.880
An opportunity they created
when they returned home

00:00:40.880 --> 00:00:44.240
from living in Australia
two years ago.

00:00:50.600 --> 00:00:53.920
And that's not the only challenge -

00:00:53.920 --> 00:00:58.800
based in one of Rotorua's
lowest socio-economic suburbs,

00:00:58.800 --> 00:01:01.200
with a 90% Maori population,

00:01:01.200 --> 00:01:04.800
every day Joe is at the cold face
of poverty.

00:01:19.080 --> 00:01:23.920
That prompted the idea to set up
a support hub for the community,

00:01:23.920 --> 00:01:28.680
a place to further cultivate
the potential of these children.

00:01:41.240 --> 00:01:42.840
It's not a new concept,

00:01:42.840 --> 00:01:47.240
but it's a concept that is right
in the heart of the community.

00:01:52.400 --> 00:01:56.000
An initiative that'll be launched
in the next few months,

00:01:56.000 --> 00:01:59.480
something they hope will feed
the stomach and the mind.

00:01:59.480 --> 00:02:00.960
Kereama Wright, Te Karere.
