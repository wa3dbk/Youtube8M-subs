00:01:47.040 --> 00:01:50.090 
especially because Tony Parker's been
healthier<00:01:47.460> Tony<00:01:48.390> Parker<00:01:48.840> to<00:01:49.020> me<00:01:49.200> is<00:01:49.560> sitting

00:01:50.090 --> 00:01:50.100 
healthier Tony Parker to me is sitting

healthier Tony Parker to me is sitting
on<00:01:50.250> at<00:01:50.579> 42<00:01:51.270> and<00:01:51.659> I<00:01:52.290> think<00:01:52.350> it's<00:01:52.710> 12<00:01:52.979> with<00:01:53.130> San

00:01:53.300 --> 00:01:53.310 
on at 42 and I think it's 12 with San

Antonio Spurs Chris Paul it's like 36
and<00:01:56.640> I<00:01:57.420> think<00:01:58.880> 36<00:01:59.880> and<00:02:00.030> 17<00:02:00.570> something<00:02:00.990> like

00:02:01.130 --> 00:02:01.140 
and I think 36 and 17 something like

00:02:01.140 --> 00:02:02.870 
and I think 36 and 17 something like
that<00:02:01.380> I<00:02:01.530> think<00:02:01.799> that's<00:02:01.979> the<00:02:02.040> thing<00:02:02.369> he<00:02:02.460> had<00:02:02.549> 36

00:02:02.870 --> 00:02:02.880 
that I think that's the thing he had 36

00:02:02.880 --> 00:02:05.899 
that I think that's the thing he had 36
and<00:02:03.060> 17<00:02:03.479> both<00:02:04.320> teams<00:02:04.619> are<00:02:04.829> doing<00:02:05.009> well<00:02:05.610> this

00:02:08.089 --> 00:02:08.099 
year Chris Paul early in the season made

00:02:08.099 --> 00:02:09.830 
year Chris Paul early in the season made
a<00:02:08.129> lot<00:02:08.280> of<00:02:08.310> noise<00:02:08.610> because<00:02:09.030> he<00:02:09.360> beat<00:02:09.539> the<00:02:09.690> San

00:02:09.830 --> 00:02:09.840

00:03:26.409 --> 00:03:26.419 
lakers by himself so he can really put

00:03:26.419 --> 00:03:29.439 
lakers by himself so he can really put
it<00:03:26.540> on<00:03:26.750> his<00:03:27.049> back<00:03:27.470> when<00:03:27.799> he<00:03:27.829> needs<00:03:28.310> to<00:03:28.489> but<00:03:29.299> the

00:03:32.020 --> 00:03:32.030 
difference between the two I think Tony

00:03:32.030 --> 00:03:34.599 
difference between the two I think Tony
Parker<00:03:32.510> can<00:03:32.689> after<00:03:33.079> sinensis<00:03:33.439> again<00:03:33.859> you<00:03:34.489> know

00:03:37.059 --> 00:03:37.069 
I mean I think he can do that I think he

00:03:37.069 --> 00:03:38.830 
I mean I think he can do that I think he
can<00:03:37.189> break<00:03:37.400> even<00:03:37.669> we<00:03:37.939> Chris<00:03:38.180> Paul<00:03:38.419> with<00:03:38.449> that

00:03:38.830 --> 00:03:38.840 
can break even we Chris Paul with that

00:03:38.840 --> 00:03:42.699 
can break even we Chris Paul with that
if<00:03:39.019> he<00:03:39.470> wants<00:03:39.949> to<00:03:40.189> I<00:03:40.400> think<00:03:40.819> he<00:03:41.449> can<00:03:41.629> score<00:03:42.259> a

00:03:42.699 --> 00:03:42.709 
if he wants to I think he can score a

00:03:42.709 --> 00:03:44.860 
if he wants to I think he can score a
little<00:03:43.400> bit<00:03:43.549> better<00:03:43.790> than<00:03:44.000> crisp<00:03:44.299> arctic<00:03:44.720> his

00:03:44.860 --> 00:03:44.870 
little bit better than crisp arctic his

00:03:44.870 --> 00:03:47.469 
little bit better than crisp arctic his
means<00:03:45.229> of<00:03:45.530> scoring<00:03:46.220> scoring<00:03:47.090> the<00:03:47.329> basketball

00:03:47.469 --> 00:03:47.479 
means of scoring scoring the basketball

00:03:47.479 --> 00:03:49.059 
means of scoring scoring the basketball
is<00:03:47.900> a<00:03:47.959> little<00:03:48.169> bit<00:03:48.259> better<00:03:48.409> because<00:03:48.680> I<00:03:48.889> think

00:03:49.059 --> 00:03:49.069 
is a little bit better because I think

00:03:49.069 --> 00:03:52.360 
is a little bit better because I think
Chris<00:03:49.489> Paul<00:03:49.819> his<00:03:50.780> game<00:03:51.049> is<00:03:51.290> predicated<00:03:51.799> more

00:03:52.360 --> 00:03:52.370 
Chris Paul his game is predicated more

00:03:52.370 --> 00:03:55.270 
Chris Paul his game is predicated more
on<00:03:52.639> the<00:03:52.819> calls<00:03:53.150> from<00:03:54.109> the<00:03:54.290> referee<00:03:54.650> but<00:03:55.069> Chris

on the calls from the referee but Chris
Paul<00:03:55.519> is<00:03:55.549> a<00:03:55.790> better<00:03:56.120> shooter<00:03:56.479> in<00:03:56.810> my<00:03:57.319> opinion

00:03:57.879 --> 00:03:57.889

Paul is 80

00:04:25.030 --> 00:04:27.120 
Paul is 80
aight<00:04:25.120> i<00:04:25.420> think<00:04:26.020> like<00:04:26.170> i<00:04:26.290> said<00:04:26.500> before<00:04:26.680> I<00:04:26.980> think

00:04:27.120 --> 00:04:27.130 
aight i think like i said before I think

00:04:27.130 --> 00:04:31.440 
aight i think like i said before I think
Tony<00:04:27.580> Parker<00:04:28.240> is<00:04:28.450> more<00:04:29.410> lethal<00:04:29.710> as<00:04:30.190> a<00:04:30.250> um<00:04:30.760> as<00:04:31.150> a

00:04:31.440 --> 00:04:31.450 
Tony Parker is more lethal as a um as a

00:04:31.450 --> 00:04:33.659 
Tony Parker is more lethal as a um as a
scorer<00:04:32.080> I<00:04:32.320> think<00:04:32.920> Chris<00:04:33.130> Paul<00:04:33.370> has<00:04:33.400> the

00:04:33.659 --> 00:04:33.669 
scorer I think Chris Paul has the

00:04:33.669 --> 00:04:35.879 
scorer I think Chris Paul has the
advantage<00:04:34.210> as<00:04:34.360> a<00:04:34.389> shooter<00:04:34.720> in<00:04:34.840> the<00:04:35.020> passer<00:04:35.470> but

00:04:35.879 --> 00:04:35.889 
advantage as a shooter in the passer but

00:04:35.889 --> 00:04:38.100 
advantage as a shooter in the passer but
when<00:04:36.040> you<00:04:36.130> look<00:04:36.220> at<00:04:36.370> the<00:04:36.490> passing<00:04:37.180> it's<00:04:37.750> only

00:04:38.100 --> 00:04:38.110 
when you look at the passing it's only

00:04:38.110 --> 00:04:40.070 
when you look at the passing it's only
three<00:04:38.410> of<00:04:38.530> two<00:04:38.919> assists<00:04:39.460> you<00:04:39.550> know<00:04:39.669> I<00:04:39.700> mean

00:04:40.070 --> 00:04:40.080 
three of two assists you know I mean

00:04:40.080 --> 00:04:43.680 
three of two assists you know I mean
27.7<00:04:41.080> it's<00:04:41.230> really<00:04:41.410> assisting<00:04:41.650> half<00:04:42.100> I<00:04:42.690> think

00:04:43.680 --> 00:04:43.690 
27.7 it's really assisting half I think

00:04:43.690 --> 00:04:45.180 
27.7 it's really assisting half I think
they<00:04:43.810> kind<00:04:43.960> of<00:04:44.080> can<00:04:44.230> break<00:04:44.440> even<00:04:44.650> i<00:04:44.860> think<00:04:45.070> this

00:04:45.180 --> 00:04:45.190 
they kind of can break even i think this

00:04:45.190 --> 00:04:47.430 
they kind of can break even i think this
paul<00:04:45.460> on<00:04:45.820> a<00:04:45.880> nightly<00:04:46.360> basis<00:04:46.840> will<00:04:47.020> throw<00:04:47.260> more

00:04:47.430 --> 00:04:47.440 
paul on a nightly basis will throw more

00:04:47.440 --> 00:04:49.860 
paul on a nightly basis will throw more
diverse<00:04:47.830> than<00:04:47.860> Tony<00:04:48.160> Parker<00:04:48.610> but<00:04:49.120> Tony<00:04:49.419> Parker

00:04:49.860 --> 00:04:49.870 
diverse than Tony Parker but Tony Parker

00:04:49.870 --> 00:04:52.409 
diverse than Tony Parker but Tony Parker
can<00:04:50.020> throw<00:04:50.290> the<00:04:50.470> tnf<00:04:51.010> needed<00:04:51.490> I<00:04:51.669> have<00:04:52.120> to<00:04:52.240> take

00:04:52.409 --> 00:04:52.419 
can throw the tnf needed I have to take

00:04:52.419 --> 00:04:53.879 
can throw the tnf needed I have to take
Tony<00:04:52.660> Parker's<00:04:53.110> especially<00:04:53.500> this<00:04:53.620> year<00:04:53.830> I

Tony Parker's especially this year I

00:04:53.889 --> 00:04:55.879
