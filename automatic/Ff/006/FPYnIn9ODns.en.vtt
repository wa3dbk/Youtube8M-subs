 I want to create better opportunities with their own hands 

00:03:54.010 --> 00:03:58.890
 Such thoughts eventually become a form 

00:03:58.960 --> 00:04:08.930
 But in order to become independent, it needed more serious improvement 

00:04:05.130 --> 00:04:16.070

 Encounter with Fusanosuke Kuhara that dictated the fate of your Daira 

00:04:43.360 --> 00:04:52.379
 And the unwavering nationalization of establishing its own independent technology led to the birth of Hitachi 

00:04:53.390 --> 00:05:00.700
 But the founding of these people was also the beginning of your hardship
