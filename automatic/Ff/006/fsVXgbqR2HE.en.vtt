first one we're talking about is the

00:00:39.540 --> 00:00:42.229 
first one we're talking about is the
lens<00:00:40.140> of<00:00:40.379> the<00:00:40.649> headlight<00:00:41.040> this<00:00:41.760> here<00:00:42.030> is<00:00:42.210> a

00:00:42.229 --> 00:00:42.239 
lens of the headlight this here is a

00:00:42.239 --> 00:00:44.389 
lens of the headlight this here is a
headlight<00:00:42.719> restoration<00:00:42.899> kit<00:00:43.440> what's<00:00:44.129> cool

00:00:44.389 --> 00:00:44.399 
headlight restoration kit what's cool

headlight restoration kit what's cool
about<00:00:44.430> this<00:00:44.910> is<00:00:45.170> your<00:00:46.170> drill<00:00:46.469> cordless<00:00:47.160> or

00:00:47.479 --> 00:00:47.489 
about this is your drill cordless or

00:00:47.489 --> 00:00:49.610 
about this is your drill cordless or
electrical<00:00:48.239> just<00:00:48.510> plug<00:00:48.719> in<00:00:48.930> is<00:00:49.050> the<00:00:49.410> only

00:00:49.610 --> 00:00:49.620 
electrical just plug in is the only

00:00:49.620 --> 00:00:52.010 
electrical just plug in is the only
thing<00:00:50.039> you<00:00:50.160> need<00:00:50.340> to<00:00:50.640> attack<00:00:51.600> this<00:00:51.750> particular

00:00:52.010 --> 00:00:52.020 
thing you need to attack this particular

00:00:52.020 --> 00:00:54.139 
thing you need to attack this particular
project<00:00:52.379> and<00:00:52.739> if<00:00:52.800> you<00:00:52.890> look<00:00:53.039> closely<00:00:53.309> take<00:00:54.120> a

00:00:54.139 --> 00:00:54.149 
project and if you look closely take a

00:00:54.149 --> 00:00:55.700 
project and if you look closely take a
look<00:00:54.300> at<00:00:54.390> the<00:00:54.449> comparison<00:00:54.750> between<00:00:55.050> the<00:00:55.469> old

00:00:55.700 --> 00:00:55.710 
look at the comparison between the old

00:00:55.710 --> 00:00:57.590 
look at the comparison between the old
and<00:00:55.890> the<00:00:56.039> new<00:00:56.610> because<00:00:56.969> this<00:00:57.149> is<00:00:57.300> where<00:00:57.480> the

00:00:57.590 --> 00:00:57.600 
and the new because this is where the

00:00:57.600 --> 00:00:59.450 
and the new because this is where the
lenses<00:00:57.989> tend<00:00:58.199> to<00:00:58.289> oxidize<00:00:58.770> they<00:00:58.980> get<00:00:59.129> cloudy

00:00:59.450 --> 00:00:59.460 
lenses tend to oxidize they get cloudy

00:00:59.460 --> 00:01:01.670 
lenses tend to oxidize they get cloudy
and<00:00:59.850> it's<00:01:00.270> a<00:01:00.329> bit<00:01:00.449> of<00:01:00.539> a<00:01:00.600> safety<00:01:00.809> concern<00:01:01.140> and

00:01:01.670 --> 00:01:01.680 
and it's a bit of a safety concern and

00:01:01.680 --> 00:01:04.340 
and it's a bit of a safety concern and
you<00:01:02.039> know<00:01:02.129> what<00:01:02.309> it's<00:01:02.489> until<00:01:02.910> you<00:01:03.140> finish<00:01:04.140> the

00:01:04.340 --> 00:01:04.350 
you know what it's until you finish the

00:01:04.350 --> 00:01:06.320 
you know what it's until you finish the
project<00:01:04.619> and<00:01:04.979> you're<00:01:05.339> driving<00:01:05.519> at<00:01:05.820> night<00:01:06.060> and

00:01:06.320 --> 00:01:06.330 
project and you're driving at night and

00:01:06.330 --> 00:01:08.240 
project and you're driving at night and
you<00:01:06.810> can<00:01:06.840> actually<00:01:07.080> see<00:01:07.290> the<00:01:07.590> road<00:01:07.799> ahead<00:01:07.830> of

00:01:08.240 --> 00:01:08.250 
you can actually see the road ahead of

00:01:08.250 --> 00:01:10.760 
you can actually see the road ahead of
you<00:01:08.369> so<00:01:08.640> that<00:01:09.240> is<00:01:09.540> a<00:01:09.570> little<00:01:10.049> product<00:01:10.560> there

00:01:10.760 --> 00:01:10.770 
you so that is a little product there

00:01:10.770 --> 00:01:13.460 
you so that is a little product there
that's<00:01:11.220> less<00:01:11.580> than<00:01:11.610> 30<00:01:12.150> bucks<00:01:12.570> and<00:01:12.810> again<00:01:13.290> very

00:01:13.460 --> 00:01:13.470 
that's less than 30 bucks and again very

00:01:13.470 --> 00:01:15.770 
that's less than 30 bucks and again very
doable<00:01:14.070> let's<00:01:14.729> jump<00:01:15.000> up<00:01:15.150> on<00:01:15.270> the<00:01:15.299> hood<00:01:15.509> here

00:01:15.770 --> 00:01:15.780 
doable let's jump up on the hood here

00:01:15.780 --> 00:01:18.170 
doable let's jump up on the hood here
okay<00:01:16.470> you<00:01:16.560> can<00:01:16.710> see<00:01:16.920> the<00:01:17.040> before<00:01:17.430> and<00:01:17.729> after

00:01:18.170 --> 00:01:18.180 
okay you can see the before and after

00:01:18.180 --> 00:01:20.450 
okay you can see the before and after
this<00:01:18.630> is<00:01:18.780> a<00:01:18.810> classic<00:01:19.229> situation<00:01:19.409> where<00:01:20.040> you

00:01:20.450 --> 00:01:20.460 
this is a classic situation where you

00:01:20.460 --> 00:01:22.219 
this is a classic situation where you
know<00:01:20.580> the<00:01:20.729> juco<00:01:21.119> the<00:01:21.299> paint<00:01:21.570> is<00:01:21.750> starting<00:01:22.110> to

00:01:22.219 --> 00:01:22.229 
know the juco the paint is starting to

00:01:22.229 --> 00:01:24.499 
know the juco the paint is starting to
oxidize<00:01:22.350> and<00:01:22.860> that<00:01:23.490> just<00:01:23.759> deteriorates<00:01:24.390> the

00:01:24.499 --> 00:01:24.509 
oxidize and that just deteriorates the

00:01:24.509 --> 00:01:27.140 
oxidize and that just deteriorates the
value<00:01:24.810> of<00:01:24.869> the<00:01:24.990> car<00:01:25.229> right<00:01:25.830> down<00:01:25.939> for<00:01:26.939> less

00:01:27.140 --> 00:01:27.150 
value of the car right down for less

00:01:27.150 --> 00:01:30.319 
value of the car right down for less
than<00:01:27.180> 60<00:01:27.840> bucks<00:01:28.520> look<00:01:29.520> what<00:01:29.700> you<00:01:29.820> can<00:01:29.970> do<00:01:30.119> and

00:01:30.319 --> 00:01:30.329 
than 60 bucks look what you can do and

00:01:30.329 --> 00:01:32.690 
than 60 bucks look what you can do and
again<00:01:31.259> as<00:01:31.530> far<00:01:31.740> as<00:01:31.890> if<00:01:32.040> you're<00:01:32.189> thinking<00:01:32.340> well

00:01:32.690 --> 00:01:32.700 
again as far as if you're thinking well

00:01:32.700 --> 00:01:34.280 
again as far as if you're thinking well
that<00:01:32.850> looks<00:01:33.060> a<00:01:33.180> little<00:01:33.329> hard<00:01:33.659> it's<00:01:34.020> not

00:01:34.280 --> 00:01:34.290 
that looks a little hard it's not

00:01:34.290 --> 00:01:35.929 
that looks a little hard it's not
because<00:01:34.680> you<00:01:34.770> just<00:01:34.890> get<00:01:35.070> a<00:01:35.100> six<00:01:35.369> inch<00:01:35.549> buffer

00:01:35.929 --> 00:01:35.939 
because you just get a six inch buffer

00:01:35.939 --> 00:01:37.580 
because you just get a six inch buffer
and<00:01:36.119> that's<00:01:36.659> where<00:01:36.869> all<00:01:36.960> the<00:01:36.990> muscle<00:01:37.409> on<00:01:37.500> the

00:01:37.580 --> 00:01:37.590 
and that's where all the muscle on the

00:01:37.590 --> 00:01:39.230 
and that's where all the muscle on the
grantees<00:01:38.040> and<00:01:38.189> you<00:01:38.460> just<00:01:38.610> let<00:01:38.790> that<00:01:38.970> do<00:01:39.119> the

00:01:39.230 --> 00:01:39.240 
grantees and you just let that do the

00:01:39.240 --> 00:01:41.600 
grantees and you just let that do the
