00:00:06.299 --> 00:00:22.509
 meal with schmadtke game seen 

00:00:15.570 --> 00:00:24.609
 difficult to judge against dresden 

00:00:22.509 --> 00:00:27.490
 because there for a moment 

00:00:24.609 --> 00:00:30.099
 after the break duisburger small projects 

00:00:27.490 --> 00:00:32.220
 then had more difficult there 

00:00:30.099 --> 00:00:34.510
 to draw the conclusions 

00:00:32.220 --> 00:00:36.460
 until he changes a bit 

00:00:34.510 --> 00:00:38.320
 played as in the last weeks of 

00:00:36.460 --> 00:00:42.220
 But the formation would be enough 

00:00:38.320 --> 00:00:44.970
 to prepare information 

00:00:42.220 --> 00:00:47.440
 accuse us of these games as well 

00:00:44.970 --> 00:00:50.890
 important league game because we 

00:00:47.440 --> 00:00:53.620
 have great goals 

00:00:50.890 --> 00:00:55.630
 to hibernate locally because it will become one 

00:00:53.620 --> 00:00:58.030
 real trophy fight was looking forward to it 

00:00:55.630 --> 00:00:59.610
 is also impressed by the stadium 

00:00:58.030 --> 00:01:06.159
 be sold out 

00:00:59.610 --> 00:01:10.689
 really interesting task so my 

00:01:06.159 --> 00:01:14.259
 player was certainly not to warn 

00:01:10.689 --> 00:01:15.630
 that we need to get 100 percent off 

00:01:14.259 --> 00:01:18.969
 is clear 

00:01:15.630 --> 00:01:19.659
 But that was always the case in Wald 

00:01:18.969 --> 00:01:22.630
 case 

00:01:19.659 --> 00:01:23.979
 that's nothing out of the ordinary 

00:01:22.630 --> 00:01:26.109
 I have to point out that we have that 

00:01:23.979 --> 00:01:32.409
 Actually, taking a game seriously is not 

00:01:26.109 --> 00:01:38.200
 it is more necessary to look 

00:01:32.409 --> 00:01:39.670
 where are the players and how fit are they? 

00:01:38.200 --> 00:01:40.869
 then it can be natural that we have the 

00:01:39.670 --> 00:01:42.780
 make one or another change 

00:01:40.869 --> 00:01:44.889
 but im able to network by two or three 

00:01:42.780 --> 00:01:45.789
 maybe it will be at the end of the day 

00:01:44.889 --> 00:01:47.829
 no one day 

00:01:45.789 --> 00:01:49.780
 if we are thinking and as I said 

00:01:47.829 --> 00:01:53.560
 we are also with the 

00:01:49.780 --> 00:01:55.270
 talk to players themselves because of 

00:01:53.560 --> 00:01:58.359
 we also have something like English 

00:01:55.270 --> 00:02:01.540
 have week and every game for us whole 

00:01:58.359 --> 00:02:05.140
 So, we are important 

00:02:01.540 --> 00:02:08.170
 now can not go therefore and say 

00:02:05.140 --> 00:02:09.490
 We spare the whole crew 

00:02:08.170 --> 00:02:11.730
 because we have an important one on sunday 

00:02:09.490 --> 00:02:14.490
 Player for us is definitely 

00:02:11.730 --> 00:02:18.700
 supreme premise of this cup game 

00:02:14.490 --> 00:02:21.070
 positive and then have 

00:02:18.700 --> 00:02:24.150
 i still have enough time left for us 

00:02:21.070 --> 00:02:24.150
 prepare sunday game
