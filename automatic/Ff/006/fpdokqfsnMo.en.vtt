00:02:45.710 --> 00:02:45.720 
corner where he cannot even reach it I

00:02:45.720 --> 00:02:47.690 
corner where he cannot even reach it I
know<00:02:45.810> it's<00:02:45.900> random<00:02:46.080> skill<00:02:46.470> but<00:02:46.950> this<00:02:47.220> like

00:02:47.690 --> 00:02:47.700 
know it's random skill but this like

00:02:47.700 --> 00:02:49.550 
know it's random skill but this like
said<00:02:47.880> before<00:02:48.090> his<00:02:48.270> finishing<00:02:48.570> is<00:02:48.840> the<00:02:49.350> main

00:02:49.550 --> 00:02:49.560 
said before his finishing is the main

00:02:49.560 --> 00:02:51.020 
said before his finishing is the main
reason<00:02:49.980> I've<00:02:50.100> probably<00:02:50.280> done<00:02:50.460> him<00:02:50.610> because<00:02:50.880> I

00:02:51.020 --> 00:02:51.030 
reason I've probably done him because I

00:02:51.030 --> 00:02:52.730 
reason I've probably done him because I
was<00:02:51.360> a<00:02:51.390> lot<00:02:51.570> of<00:02:51.630> Brazilian<00:02:52.080> strikers<00:02:52.500> and<00:02:52.620> I

00:02:52.730 --> 00:02:52.740 
was a lot of Brazilian strikers and I

00:02:52.740 --> 00:02:55.160 
was a lot of Brazilian strikers and I
like<00:02:53.250> the<00:02:53.430> cheaper<00:02:53.730> Mario<00:02:54.060> in<00:02:54.210> my<00:02:54.330> opinion<00:02:54.570> had

00:02:55.160 --> 00:02:55.170 
like the cheaper Mario in my opinion had

00:02:55.170 --> 00:02:56.840 
like the cheaper Mario in my opinion had
to<00:02:55.380> have<00:02:55.560> Firestar<00:02:56.100> skills<00:02:56.370> and<00:02:56.550> that<00:02:56.640> made<00:02:56.820> me

00:02:56.840 --> 00:02:56.850 
to have Firestar skills and that made me

00:02:56.850 --> 00:02:59.150 
to have Firestar skills and that made me
a<00:02:56.970> choice<00:02:57.210> then<00:02:57.480> out<00:02:57.870> of<00:02:57.930> whether<00:02:58.260> to<00:02:58.530> use<00:02:58.560> and

00:02:59.150 --> 00:02:59.160 
a choice then out of whether to use and

00:02:59.160 --> 00:03:02.420 
a choice then out of whether to use and
his<00:02:59.640> Bernard<00:03:00.120> at<00:03:00.270> stryker<00:03:00.570> I<00:03:00.840> used<00:03:01.350> him<00:03:01.530> and<00:03:01.680> I

00:03:02.420 --> 00:03:02.430 
his Bernard at stryker I used him and I

00:03:02.430 --> 00:03:03.590

00:03:03.600 --> 00:03:05.750 
think I played eight games and he
actually<00:03:03.780> gave<00:03:04.140> me<00:03:04.200> aids<00:03:04.560> at<00:03:04.830> stryker<00:03:05.100> the<00:03:05.610> guy

00:03:05.750 --> 00:03:05.760

a<00:04:20.160> lot<00:04:20.370> of<00:04:20.460> games<00:04:20.729> and<00:04:20.970> I<00:04:21.720> don't<00:04:21.989> know<00:04:22.049> how<00:04:22.140> good

00:04:22.310 --> 00:04:22.320 
a lot of games and I don't know how good

a lot of games and I don't know how good
is<00:04:22.500> on<00:04:22.680> the<00:04:22.890> 360<00:04:23.580> and<00:04:23.760> ps3<00:04:24.060> version

00:04:24.950 --> 00:04:24.960 
is on the 360 and ps3 version

00:04:24.960 --> 00:04:26.330 
is on the 360 and ps3 version
because<00:04:25.259> I<00:04:25.289> know<00:04:25.410> some<00:04:25.710> players<00:04:25.919> it's<00:04:26.190> quite

00:04:26.330 --> 00:04:26.340 
because I know some players it's quite

00:04:26.340 --> 00:04:27.590 
because I know some players it's quite
weird<00:04:26.490> the<00:04:26.699> Sun<00:04:26.880> players<00:04:27.060> a<00:04:27.150> lot<00:04:27.210> bear<00:04:27.509> on

00:04:27.590 --> 00:04:27.600 
weird the Sun players a lot bear on

00:04:27.600 --> 00:04:29.749 
weird the Sun players a lot bear on
next-gen<00:04:28.050> and<00:04:28.199> they<00:04:28.830> are<00:04:29.009> the<00:04:29.250> previous<00:04:29.639> gen

00:04:29.749 --> 00:04:29.759 
next-gen and they are the previous gen

00:04:29.759 --> 00:04:31.010 
next-gen and they are the previous gen
it's<00:04:29.910> quite<00:04:30.090> weird<00:04:30.240> one<00:04:30.449> but<00:04:30.780> nevertheless

00:04:31.010 --> 00:04:31.020 
it's quite weird one but nevertheless

00:04:31.020 --> 00:04:32.600 
it's quite weird one but nevertheless
imagines<00:04:31.800> because<00:04:31.979> the<00:04:32.039> gameplay<00:04:32.400> changes

00:04:32.600 --> 00:04:32.610 
imagines because the gameplay changes

00:04:32.610 --> 00:04:34.670 
imagines because the gameplay changes
but<00:04:33.240> another<00:04:33.630> example<00:04:33.990> of<00:04:34.110> a<00:04:34.199> shooting<00:04:34.380> right

00:04:34.670 --> 00:04:34.680 
but another example of a shooting right

00:04:34.680 --> 00:04:37.279 
but another example of a shooting right
there<00:04:34.860> is<00:04:34.949> power<00:04:35.160> shots<00:04:35.580> are<00:04:36.080> ridiculous<00:04:37.080> into

00:04:37.279 --> 00:04:37.289 
there is power shots are ridiculous into

00:04:37.289 --> 00:04:39.469 
there is power shots are ridiculous into
the<00:04:37.380> corner<00:04:37.740> and<00:04:37.889> he's<00:04:38.370> like<00:04:38.759> this<00:04:39.060> is<00:04:39.210> quite<00:04:39.449> a

00:04:39.469 --> 00:04:39.479 
the corner and he's like this is quite a

00:04:39.479 --> 00:04:42.170 
the corner and he's like this is quite a
lucky<00:04:40.080> guard<00:04:40.410> say<00:04:40.680> but<00:04:41.160> his<00:04:41.340> fake<00:04:41.639> shot<00:04:41.910> into

00:04:42.170 --> 00:04:42.180 
lucky guard say but his fake shot into

00:04:42.180 --> 00:04:44.420 
lucky guard say but his fake shot into
like<00:04:42.300> the<00:04:42.449> finesse<00:04:42.810> it<00:04:43.289> works<00:04:43.830> really<00:04:44.280> really

00:04:44.420 --> 00:04:44.430 
like the finesse it works really really

00:04:44.430 --> 00:04:46.909 
like the finesse it works really really
well<00:04:44.699> and<00:04:45.060> of<00:04:46.020> course<00:04:46.259> you<00:04:46.349> got<00:04:46.470> know<00:04:46.590> when<00:04:46.770> to

00:04:46.909 --> 00:04:46.919 
well and of course you got know when to

00:04:46.919 --> 00:04:48.740 
well and of course you got know when to
use<00:04:47.069> the<00:04:47.160> finesse<00:04:47.400> and<00:04:47.520> stuff<00:04:47.699> but<00:04:48.509> I<00:04:48.569> think

00:04:48.740 --> 00:04:48.750 
use the finesse and stuff but I think

00:04:48.750 --> 00:04:50.240 
use the finesse and stuff but I think
this<00:04:48.810> is<00:04:48.900> the<00:04:49.020> final<00:04:49.349> goal<00:04:49.500> of<00:04:49.590> the<00:04:49.710> episode<00:04:49.979> of

00:05:02.930 --> 00:05:02.940 
me to do in the future because I've see

00:05:02.940 --> 00:05:05.510

theres<00:05:03.509> forty-two<00:05:03.720> legends<00:05:04.349> and<00:05:04.500> I<00:05:05.250> imagine

00:05:05.510 --> 00:05:05.520 
theres forty-two legends and I imagine

00:05:05.520 --> 00:05:06.860 
theres forty-two legends and I imagine
you<00:05:05.789> guys<00:05:05.940> would<00:05:06.090> like<00:05:06.180> to<00:05:06.330> use<00:05:06.479> them<00:05:06.630> but<00:05:06.810> you

00:05:06.860 --> 00:05:06.870 
you guys would like to use them but you

00:05:06.870 --> 00:05:07.999 
you guys would like to use them but you
may<00:05:06.900> not<00:05:06.990> be<00:05:07.110> able<00:05:07.169> to<00:05:07.259> afford<00:05:07.349> them<00:05:07.680> so<00:05:07.979> I

00:05:07.999 --> 00:05:08.009 
may not be able to afford them so I

00:05:08.009 --> 00:05:09.080 
may not be able to afford them so I
think<00:05:08.099> there's<00:05:08.310> a<00:05:08.340> better<00:05:08.490> alternative<00:05:08.639> for

00:05:09.080 --> 00:05:09.090 
think there's a better alternative for

think there's a better alternative for
me<00:05:09.330> to<00:05:09.449> do<00:05:09.509> as<00:05:09.690> a<00:05:10.160> miniseries<00:05:11.160> I<00:05:11.250> want<00:05:11.669> to<00:05:11.729> do<00:05:11.789> a
