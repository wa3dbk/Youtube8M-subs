00:00:39.920 --> 00:00:39.930 
of all of us me and I thought wouldn't

00:00:39.930 --> 00:00:44.450 
of all of us me and I thought wouldn't
it<00:00:40.110> be<00:00:40.399> easy<00:00:41.399> and<00:00:41.820> maybe<00:00:42.540> just<00:00:42.809> have<00:00:43.379> the<00:00:43.860> debit

00:00:44.450 --> 00:00:44.460 
it be easy and maybe just have the debit

00:00:44.460 --> 00:00:46.160 
it be easy and maybe just have the debit
or<00:00:44.670> credit<00:00:44.789> cards<00:00:45.270> that<00:00:45.420> you<00:00:45.510> use<00:00:45.750> on<00:00:45.780> these

00:00:46.160 --> 00:00:46.170 
or credit cards that you use on these

00:00:46.170 --> 00:00:49.220 
or credit cards that you use on these
devices<00:00:46.670> instead<00:00:47.670> of<00:00:47.940> cutting<00:00:48.239> your<00:00:48.660> entire

00:00:49.220 --> 00:00:49.230 
devices instead of cutting your entire

00:00:49.230 --> 00:00:51.650 
devices instead of cutting your entire
wallet<00:00:49.770> about<00:00:50.160> and<00:00:50.460> it<00:00:50.910> just<00:00:51.090> makes<00:00:51.300> a<00:00:51.480> bit

00:00:51.650 --> 00:00:51.660 
wallet about and it just makes a bit

00:00:51.660 --> 00:00:54.350 
wallet about and it just makes a bit
more<00:00:51.690> easier<00:00:52.440> and<00:00:52.680> practical<00:00:53.550> i<00:00:53.610> guess<00:00:53.850> the

00:00:54.350 --> 00:00:54.360 
more easier and practical i guess the

00:00:54.360 --> 00:00:56.330 
more easier and practical i guess the
second<00:00:54.750> change<00:00:55.020> and<00:00:55.320> it<00:00:55.410> relates<00:00:55.710> to<00:00:55.860> pockets

00:00:56.330 --> 00:00:56.340 
second change and it relates to pockets

00:00:56.340 --> 00:00:59.209 
second change and it relates to pockets
again<00:00:56.520> is<00:00:57.199> relocating<00:00:58.199> some<00:00:58.440> of<00:00:58.559> the<00:00:58.680> interior

carry something more than an ipad the
fact<00:02:25.860> change<00:02:26.340> to<00:02:26.549> the<00:02:26.640> best<00:02:26.849> is<00:02:27.090> that<00:02:27.150> we've

00:02:27.500 --> 00:02:27.510 
fact change to the best is that we've

00:02:27.510 --> 00:02:29.839 
fact change to the best is that we've
changed<00:02:27.900> the<00:02:28.200> inner<00:02:28.500> fabric<00:02:29.010> and<00:02:29.280> we've<00:02:29.670> done

00:02:32.149 --> 00:02:32.159 
this for a number of reasons number one

00:02:32.159 --> 00:02:36.229 
this for a number of reasons number one
people<00:02:33.090> travel<00:02:33.299> to<00:02:33.659> warmer<00:02:34.379> climates<00:02:35.099> it's<00:02:35.909> a

00:02:36.229 --> 00:02:36.239 
people travel to warmer climates it's a

00:02:36.239 --> 00:02:38.720 
people travel to warmer climates it's a

00:02:43.569 --> 00:02:43.579 
two it's made the vest even more later

00:02:43.579 --> 00:02:47.479 
two it's made the vest even more later
specifically<00:02:45.019> 39-percent<00:02:46.019> later<00:02:46.560> so<00:02:47.340> now

00:02:47.479 --> 00:02:47.489 
specifically 39-percent later so now

00:02:47.489 --> 00:02:49.879 
specifically 39-percent later so now
even<00:02:48.180> before<00:02:48.450> you<00:02:48.690> load<00:02:48.900> stuff<00:02:49.139> and<00:02:49.440> it's

00:02:49.879 --> 00:02:49.889 
even before you load stuff and it's

00:02:49.889 --> 00:02:52.729 
even before you load stuff and it's
extremely<00:02:50.700> lightweight<00:02:51.389> and<00:02:51.810> when<00:02:52.409> you<00:02:52.530> load

00:02:52.729 --> 00:02:52.739 
extremely lightweight and when you load

00:02:52.739 --> 00:02:54.890 
extremely lightweight and when you load
stuff<00:02:53.069> up<00:02:53.250> you<00:02:53.459> know<00:02:53.579> it's<00:02:54.359> a<00:02:54.510> good<00:02:54.659> balance

00:02:54.890 --> 00:02:54.900 
stuff up you know it's a good balance

00:02:54.900 --> 00:02:58.099 
stuff up you know it's a good balance
and<00:02:55.819> it's<00:02:56.819> probably<00:02:57.000> one<00:02:57.389> of<00:02:57.420> the<00:02:57.540> things<00:02:57.750> up

00:02:58.099 --> 00:02:58.109 
and it's probably one of the things up

00:02:58.109 --> 00:03:00.170 
and it's probably one of the things up
there<00:02:58.409> for<00:02:58.590> myself<00:02:58.920> personally<00:02:59.180> doll-like

00:03:00.170 --> 00:03:00.180

00:03:05.110 --> 00:03:05.120 
this is probably one of the highest

00:03:05.120 --> 00:03:07.339 
this is probably one of the highest
changes<00:03:06.120> that<00:03:06.269> I<00:03:06.299> was<00:03:06.629> looking<00:03:06.840> forward<00:03:07.200> to
