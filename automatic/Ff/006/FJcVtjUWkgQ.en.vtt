00:04:06.980 --> 00:04:06.990 
everyday football fan yeah I'm afraid it

00:04:06.990 --> 00:04:08.990 
everyday football fan yeah I'm afraid it
is<00:04:07.140> the<00:04:07.410> detachment<00:04:07.770> comes<00:04:08.220> from<00:04:08.490> the<00:04:08.760> players

00:04:08.990 --> 00:04:09.000 
is the detachment comes from the players

00:04:09.000 --> 00:04:13.040 
is the detachment comes from the players
earned<00:04:09.690> in<00:04:09.870> so<00:04:10.170> many<00:04:10.410> more<00:04:10.680> times<00:04:11.270> a<00:04:12.270> week<00:04:12.780> than

00:04:13.040 --> 00:04:13.050 
earned in so many more times a week than

00:04:13.050 --> 00:04:15.860 
earned in so many more times a week than
what<00:04:13.230> any<00:04:13.500> fan<00:04:14.310> would<00:04:14.580> ever<00:04:14.730> do<00:04:14.970> and<00:04:15.240> because

00:04:15.860 --> 00:04:15.870 
what any fan would ever do and because

00:04:15.870 --> 00:04:18.440 
what any fan would ever do and because
of<00:04:15.900> that<00:04:16.459> it<00:04:17.459> cost<00:04:17.730> more<00:04:17.940> to<00:04:18.030> go<00:04:18.150> and<00:04:18.270> watch

00:04:18.440 --> 00:04:18.450 
of that it cost more to go and watch

00:04:18.450 --> 00:04:21.110 
of that it cost more to go and watch
football<00:04:18.690> so<00:04:19.590> it's<00:04:20.340> almost<00:04:20.489> becoming<00:04:21.000> a

00:04:21.110 --> 00:04:21.120 
football so it's almost becoming a

00:04:21.120 --> 00:04:22.850 
football so it's almost becoming a
little<00:04:21.239> bit<00:04:21.330> more<00:04:21.450> elite<00:04:21.870> that<00:04:22.049> the<00:04:22.200> people

00:04:22.850 --> 00:04:22.860 
little bit more elite that the people

00:04:22.860 --> 00:04:23.990 
little bit more elite that the people
that<00:04:22.890> can<00:04:23.130> afford<00:04:23.370> to<00:04:23.550> go<00:04:23.640> and<00:04:23.760> watch<00:04:23.880> a

00:04:23.990 --> 00:04:24.000 
that can afford to go and watch a

00:04:24.000 --> 00:04:26.930 
that can afford to go and watch a
football<00:04:24.150> aren't<00:04:25.080> you<00:04:25.200> your<00:04:25.680> everyday<00:04:25.980> rather

football aren't you your everyday rather

00:04:26.940 --> 00:04:28.520

00:04:32.510 --> 00:04:32.520 
think there needs to be some kind of cap

00:04:32.520 --> 00:04:35.270 
think there needs to be some kind of cap
on<00:04:32.990> how<00:04:33.990> much<00:04:34.020> a<00:04:34.230> club<00:04:34.590> can<00:04:34.770> actually<00:04:35.040> charge

00:04:35.270 --> 00:04:35.280 
on how much a club can actually charge

00:04:35.280 --> 00:04:37.190 
on how much a club can actually charge
to<00:04:35.700> go<00:04:35.850> and<00:04:36.000> watch<00:04:36.150> a<00:04:36.240> football<00:04:36.390> match<00:04:36.570> I<00:04:37.050> was
