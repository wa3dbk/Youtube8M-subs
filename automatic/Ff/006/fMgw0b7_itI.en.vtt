owner<00:03:22.579> who<00:03:22.700> was<00:03:22.879> correct<00:03:23.420> well<00:03:23.689> um<00:03:23.989> I<00:03:24.379> think

00:03:25.199 --> 00:03:25.209 
owner who was correct well um I think

00:03:25.209 --> 00:03:28.179 
owner who was correct well um I think
because<00:03:26.209> it<00:03:26.480> was<00:03:26.629> Halloween<00:03:27.260> and<00:03:27.469> because<00:03:27.650> I

00:03:28.179 --> 00:03:28.189 
because it was Halloween and because I

00:03:28.189 --> 00:03:30.550 
because it was Halloween and because I
was<00:03:28.730> supposed<00:03:29.150> to<00:03:29.299> be<00:03:29.389> the<00:03:29.540> bats<00:03:29.810> out<00:03:30.170> of<00:03:30.260> hell

00:03:30.550 --> 00:03:30.560 
was supposed to be the bats out of hell

00:03:30.560 --> 00:03:33.129 
was supposed to be the bats out of hell
type<00:03:31.010> of<00:03:31.159> a<00:03:31.250> thing<00:03:31.280> obviously<00:03:32.030> we<00:03:32.599> had<00:03:32.810> to<00:03:32.959> put

00:03:33.129 --> 00:03:33.139 
type of a thing obviously we had to put

00:03:33.139 --> 00:03:36.069 
type of a thing obviously we had to put
something<00:03:33.680> in<00:03:33.920> to<00:03:34.159> go<00:03:34.430> with<00:03:34.670> a<00:03:34.700> story<00:03:35.180> which

00:03:36.069 --> 00:03:36.079 
something in to go with a story which

00:03:36.079 --> 00:03:38.649 
something in to go with a story which
you<00:03:36.590> know<00:03:36.739> those<00:03:37.280> two<00:03:37.730> other<00:03:38.060> lifts

00:03:38.649 --> 00:03:38.659 
you know those two other lifts

00:03:38.659 --> 00:03:41.649 
you know those two other lifts
represented<00:03:39.560> me<00:03:39.739> as<00:03:39.950> a<00:03:39.980> bat<00:03:40.370> and<00:03:40.819> all<00:03:41.329> of<00:03:41.480> that

00:03:41.649 --> 00:03:41.659 
represented me as a bat and all of that

00:03:41.659 --> 00:03:43.599 
represented me as a bat and all of that
so<00:03:41.900> I<00:03:41.930> think<00:03:42.019> it<00:03:42.349> went<00:03:42.799> perfectly<00:03:43.220> with<00:03:43.340> the

00:03:43.599 --> 00:03:43.609 
so I think it went perfectly with the

00:03:43.609 --> 00:03:46.390 
so I think it went perfectly with the
whole<00:03:43.909> Halloween<00:03:44.900> yeah<00:03:45.680> yeah<00:03:45.889> yeah

00:03:48.919 --> 00:03:50.979 
absolutely and there were tens banded
about<00:03:49.159> when<00:03:49.459> I<00:03:49.489> say<00:03:49.549> banded<00:03:50.090> about<00:03:50.329> their

00:03:50.979 --> 00:03:50.989

00:03:50.989 --> 00:03:53.649 
about when I say banded about their
people<00:03:51.560> got<00:03:51.739> tent<00:03:51.919> was<00:03:52.099> it<00:03:52.189> difficult<00:03:52.659> going
