a<00:01:34.659> green<00:01:34.930> car<00:01:35.259> it's<00:01:35.560> it's<00:01:36.130> half<00:01:36.369> the<00:01:36.399> way<00:01:36.850> it's

00:01:37.230 --> 00:01:37.240 
a green car it's it's half the way it's

00:01:37.240 --> 00:01:41.219 
a green car it's it's half the way it's
going<00:01:37.420> to<00:01:37.509> use<00:01:38.850> half<00:01:39.850> the<00:01:39.880> energy<00:01:40.210> and<00:01:40.840> you're

00:01:41.219 --> 00:01:41.229 
going to use half the energy and you're

00:01:41.229 --> 00:01:42.870 
going to use half the energy and you're
going<00:01:41.350> to<00:01:41.409> still<00:01:41.649> have<00:01:41.830> the<00:01:42.280> same<00:01:42.490> performance

00:01:42.870 --> 00:01:42.880 
going to still have the same performance

00:01:42.880 --> 00:01:44.969 
going to still have the same performance
if<00:01:43.210> not<00:01:43.360> better<00:01:43.570> than<00:01:44.229> what<00:01:44.439> we<00:01:44.470> have<00:01:44.740> now<00:01:44.770> and

00:01:44.969 --> 00:01:44.979 
if not better than what we have now and

00:01:44.979 --> 00:01:47.370 
if not better than what we have now and
that's<00:01:45.850> what<00:01:46.000> the<00:01:46.240> future<00:01:46.600> is<00:01:46.630> about<00:01:46.899> you<00:01:47.289> know

00:01:47.370 --> 00:01:47.380 
that's what the future is about you know

00:01:47.380 --> 00:01:50.249 
that's what the future is about you know
and<00:01:47.649> it's<00:01:47.770> making<00:01:48.220> the<00:01:48.880> most<00:01:49.090> efficient<00:01:49.570> you

00:01:50.249 --> 00:01:50.259 
and it's making the most efficient you

00:01:50.259 --> 00:01:51.960 
and it's making the most efficient you
know<00:01:50.409> product<00:01:51.159> that<00:01:51.310> you<00:01:51.429> can<00:01:51.670> and<00:01:51.850> that's

00:01:51.960 --> 00:01:51.970 
know product that you can and that's

00:01:51.970 --> 00:01:53.429 
know product that you can and that's
what<00:01:52.210> all<00:01:52.299> the<00:01:52.390> manufacturers<00:01:53.020> are<00:01:53.170> looking

00:01:53.429 --> 00:01:53.439 
what all the manufacturers are looking

00:01:53.439 --> 00:01:57.510 
what all the manufacturers are looking
to<00:01:53.530> do<00:01:53.710> and<00:01:54.810> time<00:01:55.810> driving<00:01:56.049> time<00:01:56.740> is<00:01:56.950> now<00:01:57.159> you

00:01:57.510 --> 00:01:57.520 
to do and time driving time is now you

00:01:57.520 --> 00:01:59.850 
to do and time driving time is now you
know<00:01:57.640> I<00:01:57.670> think<00:01:58.080> before<00:01:59.080> somebody<00:01:59.470> else<00:01:59.619> does

00:01:59.850 --> 00:01:59.860 
know I think before somebody else does

00:01:59.860 --> 00:02:01.380 
know I think before somebody else does
that<00:02:00.190> we<00:02:00.310> should<00:02:00.490> be<00:02:00.580> the<00:02:00.700> first<00:02:00.909> one<00:02:01.090> to<00:02:01.119> do<00:02:01.360> it

00:02:01.380 --> 00:02:01.390 
that we should be the first one to do it

00:02:01.390 --> 00:02:03.120 
that we should be the first one to do it
you<00:02:01.690> know<00:02:01.810> I<00:02:01.840> think<00:02:02.020> that's<00:02:02.350> what<00:02:02.619> the

00:02:03.120 --> 00:02:03.130 
you know I think that's what the

00:02:03.130 --> 00:02:05.070 
you know I think that's what the
Indianapolis<00:02:03.759> Motor<00:02:03.850> Speedway<00:02:04.060> Speedway<00:02:04.689> was

00:02:05.070 --> 00:02:05.080 
Indianapolis Motor Speedway Speedway was

00:02:05.080 --> 00:02:08.160 
Indianapolis Motor Speedway Speedway was
built<00:02:05.289> on<00:02:05.500> you<00:02:05.830> know<00:02:05.950> innovation<00:02:06.580> and<00:02:07.170> you

00:02:08.160 --> 00:02:08.170 
built on you know innovation and you

00:02:08.170 --> 00:02:11.640 
built on you know innovation and you
know<00:02:08.259> this<00:02:08.500> is<00:02:08.709> that<00:02:08.950> and<00:02:09.549> I<00:02:10.000> think<00:02:10.090> I<00:02:10.810> think<00:02:11.560> we

00:02:11.640 --> 00:02:11.650 
know this is that and I think I think we

00:02:11.650 --> 00:02:14.130 
know this is that and I think I think we
need<00:02:11.799> to<00:02:11.920> do<00:02:12.040> it
