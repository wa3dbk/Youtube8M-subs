00:01:37.540 --> 00:01:37.550 
one thing I would change our d sucks

00:01:37.550 --> 00:01:40.690 
one thing I would change our d sucks
because<00:01:38.270> they<00:01:38.960> are<00:01:39.140> widely<00:01:39.830> little<00:01:40.399> stripes

00:01:40.700 --> 00:01:42.039 
because they are widely little stripes
that<00:01:40.850> I<00:01:40.909> would<00:01:41.119> maybe<00:01:41.270> case<00:01:41.570> them<00:01:41.810> to

00:01:42.039 --> 00:01:42.049 
that I would maybe case them to

00:01:42.049 --> 00:01:44.950 
that I would maybe case them to
something<00:01:42.320> more<00:01:42.590> colorful<00:01:42.890> or<00:01:43.460> maybe<00:01:44.360> just<00:01:44.630> a

00:01:44.950 --> 00:01:44.960 
something more colorful or maybe just a

be<00:01:50.330> changed<00:01:50.659> to<00:01:50.780> bears<00:01:51.259> maybe<00:01:51.649> or<00:01:52.160> something

00:01:52.570 --> 00:01:52.580 
be changed to bears maybe or something

00:01:52.580 --> 00:01:56.200
