going<00:00:22.529> to<00:00:22.590> apply<00:00:22.800> this<00:00:22.949> to<00:00:23.220> our<00:00:23.310> writing<00:00:23.730> and

00:00:24.140 --> 00:00:24.150 
going to apply this to our writing and

00:00:24.150 --> 00:00:25.519 
going to apply this to our writing and
we're<00:00:24.269> going<00:00:24.390> to<00:00:24.449> learn<00:00:24.539> some<00:00:24.779> strategies<00:00:25.380> if

00:00:25.519 --> 00:00:25.529 
we're going to learn some strategies if

00:00:25.529 --> 00:00:26.779 
we're going to learn some strategies if
this<00:00:25.769> is<00:00:25.890> a<00:00:25.920> problem<00:00:26.130> for<00:00:26.490> you<00:00:26.550> if<00:00:26.670> your

00:00:26.779 --> 00:00:26.789 
this is a problem for you if your

00:00:26.789 --> 00:00:29.390 
this is a problem for you if your
sentences<00:00:27.300> going<00:00:27.990> on<00:00:28.109> too<00:00:28.320> long<00:00:28.590> if<00:00:29.160> you're

00:00:32.690 --> 00:00:32.700 
not clear that they're accurate and then

00:00:32.700 --> 00:00:34.580 
not clear that they're accurate and then
you<00:00:33.270> know<00:00:33.420> we'll<00:00:33.750> get<00:00:33.899> some<00:00:34.050> strategies<00:00:34.469> to

00:00:34.580 --> 00:00:34.590 
you know we'll get some strategies to

00:00:34.590 --> 00:00:38.420 
you know we'll get some strategies to
help<00:00:34.620> you<00:00:35.239> all<00:00:36.239> right<00:00:36.680> here's<00:00:37.680> an<00:00:37.800> example<00:00:38.070> of

00:00:58.099 --> 00:00:58.109 
looked like the whole zoo would escape

00:00:58.109 --> 00:01:00.709 
looked like the whole zoo would escape
because<00:00:58.379> actually<00:00:58.890> it<00:00:59.070> had<00:00:59.340> i<00:00:59.609> think<00:01:00.000> is<00:01:00.300> this

it's<00:01:04.619> quite<00:01:04.799> original<00:01:05.010> idea<00:01:05.580> it's<00:01:05.729> quite<00:01:05.850> a

00:01:05.870 --> 00:01:05.880 
it's quite original idea it's quite a

00:01:05.880 --> 00:01:07.490 
it's quite original idea it's quite a
nice<00:01:06.030> idea<00:01:06.479> i<00:01:06.570> suppose<00:01:06.960> you've<00:01:07.170> got<00:01:07.200> a<00:01:07.320> lot<00:01:07.470> of

00:01:07.490 --> 00:01:07.500 
nice idea i suppose you've got a lot of

00:01:07.500 --> 00:01:09.530 
nice idea i suppose you've got a lot of
potential<00:01:07.830> here<00:01:08.070> the<00:01:08.790> piece<00:01:08.970> of<00:01:09.119> writing<00:01:09.270> is

00:01:09.530 --> 00:01:09.540 
potential here the piece of writing is

00:01:09.540 --> 00:01:13.580 
potential here the piece of writing is
ruined<00:01:10.020> by<00:01:10.799> the<00:01:11.340> sentence<00:01:12.030> structure<00:01:12.960> and<00:01:13.500> you

00:01:13.580 --> 00:01:13.590 
ruined by the sentence structure and you

00:01:13.590 --> 00:01:15.620 
ruined by the sentence structure and you
can<00:01:13.740> see<00:01:14.010> from<00:01:14.310> looking<00:01:14.490> at<00:01:14.729> it<00:01:14.850> it's<00:01:14.970> just<00:01:15.420> too

00:01:15.620 --> 00:01:15.630 
can see from looking at it it's just too

00:01:15.630 --> 00:01:17.630 
can see from looking at it it's just too
long<00:01:15.869> here's<00:01:16.350> his<00:01:16.530> full<00:01:16.830> stop<00:01:17.100> right<00:01:17.369> at<00:01:17.549> the

00:01:17.630 --> 00:01:17.640 
long here's his full stop right at the

00:01:17.640 --> 00:01:19.730 
long here's his full stop right at the
end<00:01:17.790> there<00:01:18.060> you've<00:01:18.479> got<00:01:18.509> all<00:01:18.840> of<00:01:18.900> this<00:01:19.530> if

00:01:19.730 --> 00:01:19.740 
end there you've got all of this if

00:01:19.740 --> 00:01:21.109 
end there you've got all of this if
you're<00:01:19.950> writing<00:01:20.220> in<00:01:20.490> ways<00:01:20.640> you've<00:01:20.820> got<00:01:20.970> this

00:01:21.109 --> 00:01:21.119 
you're writing in ways you've got this

00:01:21.119 --> 00:01:22.999 
you're writing in ways you've got this
many<00:01:21.390> words<00:01:21.630> before<00:01:21.960> you<00:01:22.140> full<00:01:22.350> stop<00:01:22.590> you're

00:01:22.999 --> 00:01:23.009 
many words before you full stop you're

00:01:23.009 --> 00:01:25.520 
many words before you full stop you're
probably<00:01:23.400> writing<00:01:24.180> in<00:01:24.390> in<00:01:24.720> accurate

00:01:25.520 --> 00:01:25.530 
probably writing in in accurate

00:01:25.530 --> 00:01:28.490 
probably writing in in accurate
sentences<00:01:26.250> so<00:01:26.759> that's<00:01:27.060> what<00:01:27.360> we<00:01:27.509> mean<00:01:27.720> by<00:01:28.259> an

00:01:28.490 --> 00:01:28.500 
sentences so that's what we mean by an

00:01:28.500 --> 00:01:30.469 
sentences so that's what we mean by an
inaccurate<00:01:29.009> centers<00:01:29.610> and<00:01:29.790> that's<00:01:29.909> typical<00:01:30.390> of

00:01:30.469 --> 00:01:30.479 
inaccurate centers and that's typical of

00:01:30.479 --> 00:01:31.760 
inaccurate centers and that's typical of
the<00:01:30.600> things<00:01:30.810> that<00:01:31.020> we<00:01:31.140> we're<00:01:31.470> kind<00:01:31.619> of<00:01:31.650> getting

00:01:31.760 --> 00:01:31.770 
the things that we we're kind of getting

00:01:31.770 --> 00:01:35.109 
the things that we we're kind of getting
at<00:01:32.009> the<00:01:32.070> moment<00:01:32.369> so<00:01:33.360> pause<00:01:34.020> the<00:01:34.049> video<00:01:34.320> now<00:01:34.500> and

00:01:35.109 --> 00:01:35.119 
at the moment so pause the video now and

00:01:35.119 --> 00:01:37.280 
at the moment so pause the video now and
see<00:01:36.119> if<00:01:36.180> you<00:01:36.240> can<00:01:36.360> rewrite<00:01:36.780> this<00:01:36.840> put<00:01:37.229> the

00:01:37.280 --> 00:01:37.290 
see if you can rewrite this put the

00:01:37.290 --> 00:01:39.499 
see if you can rewrite this put the
sentences<00:01:37.860> in<00:01:38.009> where<00:01:38.369> should<00:01:38.700> the<00:01:38.909> sentences

00:01:39.499 --> 00:01:39.509 
sentences in where should the sentences

00:02:03.290 --> 00:02:03.300 
then this will

00:02:03.300 --> 00:02:04.670 
then this will
need<00:02:03.420> to<00:02:03.450> be<00:02:03.600> a<00:02:03.630> capital<00:02:04.080> letter<00:02:04.200> wouldn't<00:02:04.620> it

elephants and tigers full stop okay and

00:02:11.190 --> 00:02:13.040 
elephants and tigers full stop okay and
then<00:02:11.430> you<00:02:11.520> move<00:02:11.670> on<00:02:11.760> to<00:02:11.880> a<00:02:11.910> new<00:02:12.000> thought<00:02:12.570> it

00:02:13.040 --> 00:02:13.050 
then you move on to a new thought it

00:02:13.050 --> 00:02:15.020 
then you move on to a new thought it
looked<00:02:13.260> like<00:02:13.410> the<00:02:13.770> whole<00:02:14.280> zoo<00:02:14.520> had<00:02:14.670> escaped

00:02:15.020 --> 00:02:15.030 
looked like the whole zoo had escaped

00:02:15.030 --> 00:02:17.030 
looked like the whole zoo had escaped
because<00:02:15.480> actually<00:02:15.960> it<00:02:15.990> had<00:02:16.200> see<00:02:16.530> this<00:02:16.680> little

00:02:17.030 --> 00:02:17.040 
because actually it had see this little

00:02:17.040 --> 00:02:18.500 
because actually it had see this little
thing<00:02:17.340> here<00:02:17.370> doesn't<00:02:17.850> really<00:02:18.000> work<00:02:18.210> too<00:02:18.480> well

00:02:18.500 --> 00:02:18.510 
thing here doesn't really work too well

00:02:18.510 --> 00:02:21.230 
thing here doesn't really work too well
isn't<00:02:18.930> it<00:02:19.550> you<00:02:20.550> know<00:02:20.670> and<00:02:20.700> you<00:02:20.850> could<00:02:21.000> get<00:02:21.090> rid

00:02:21.230 --> 00:02:21.240 
isn't it you know and you could get rid

00:02:21.240 --> 00:02:23.750 
isn't it you know and you could get rid
of<00:02:21.330> that<00:02:21.540> but<00:02:22.440> you'd<00:02:22.560> end<00:02:22.800> up<00:02:23.040> with<00:02:23.370> something

00:02:23.750 --> 00:02:23.760 
of that but you'd end up with something

00:02:23.760 --> 00:02:28.100 
of that but you'd end up with something
like<00:02:25.340> like<00:02:26.340> this<00:02:26.520> so<00:02:27.420> you<00:02:27.480> got<00:02:27.570> your<00:02:27.600> full<00:02:27.870> stop
