alright<00:00:23.509> so<00:00:23.720> in<00:00:23.839> the<00:00:23.900> first<00:00:24.050> video<00:00:24.289> we've<00:00:25.130> got

00:00:25.300 --> 00:00:25.310 
alright so in the first video we've got

00:00:25.310 --> 00:00:27.790 
alright so in the first video we've got
the<00:00:25.550> shell<00:00:26.509> built<00:00:26.839> and<00:00:27.289> now<00:00:27.439> I'm<00:00:27.500> ready<00:00:27.649> to

00:00:27.790 --> 00:00:27.800 
the shell built and now I'm ready to

00:00:27.800 --> 00:00:29.740 
the shell built and now I'm ready to
start<00:00:27.980> with<00:00:28.429> the<00:00:28.460> intersection<00:00:29.210> so<00:00:29.539> let<00:00:29.660> me

00:00:29.740 --> 00:00:29.750 
start with the intersection so let me

00:00:29.750 --> 00:00:31.179 
start with the intersection so let me
show<00:00:29.839> you

00:00:31.179 --> 00:00:31.189 
show you

00:00:31.189 --> 00:00:34.640 
show you
the<00:00:32.189> plan<00:00:32.460> is<00:00:32.730> to<00:00:32.759> do<00:00:33.000> a<00:00:33.030> five-sided<00:00:33.989> Pentagon

00:00:34.640 --> 00:00:34.650 
the plan is to do a five-sided Pentagon

00:00:34.650 --> 00:00:35.440 
the plan is to do a five-sided Pentagon
tunnel

00:00:35.440 --> 00:00:35.450 
tunnel

00:00:35.450 --> 00:00:41.570 
tunnel
so<00:00:36.450> imagine<00:00:37.380> a<00:00:38.630> Pentagon<00:00:39.630> here<00:00:40.340> you<00:00:41.340> know

00:00:41.570 --> 00:00:41.580 
so imagine a Pentagon here you know

00:00:41.580 --> 00:00:46.270 
so imagine a Pentagon here you know
drawing<00:00:41.910> it's<00:00:42.150> not<00:00:42.300> that<00:00:42.510> great<00:00:44.450> let's<00:00:45.450> see

00:00:46.270 --> 00:00:46.280 
drawing it's not that great let's see

00:00:46.280 --> 00:00:50.770 
drawing it's not that great let's see
these<00:00:47.280> sort<00:00:47.550> of<00:00:47.580> like<00:00:47.760> that<00:00:48.320> on<00:00:49.320> each<00:00:49.769> side

00:00:50.770 --> 00:00:50.780 
these sort of like that on each side

00:00:50.780 --> 00:00:56.350 
these sort of like that on each side
will<00:00:51.780> be<00:00:51.930> three<00:00:52.350> drivers<00:00:53.510> these<00:00:54.510> will<00:00:54.750> be<00:00:54.900> 15

00:00:56.350 --> 00:00:56.360 
will be three drivers these will be 15

00:00:56.360 --> 00:01:01.220 
will be three drivers these will be 15
so<00:00:57.360> we<00:00:57.660> got<00:00:57.890> five<00:00:58.890> sides<00:00:59.629> times<00:01:00.629> three<00:01:00.960> drivers

00:01:01.220 --> 00:01:01.230 
so we got five sides times three drivers

00:01:01.230 --> 00:01:07.130 
so we got five sides times three drivers
for<00:01:01.680> talking<00:01:02.270> 15<00:01:03.270> 15<00:01:03.739> overall<00:01:05.690> this<00:01:06.690> is<00:01:06.750> the

00:01:07.130 --> 00:01:07.140 
for talking 15 15 overall this is the

00:01:07.140 --> 00:01:08.740 
for talking 15 15 overall this is the
template<00:01:08.070> that<00:01:08.130> I<00:01:08.250> built

00:01:08.740 --> 00:01:08.750 
template that I built

00:01:08.750 --> 00:01:11.270 
template that I built
it's<00:01:09.750> simply<00:01:10.140> just<00:01:10.170> a<00:01:10.440> piece<00:01:10.590> of<00:01:10.619> cardboard<00:01:10.920> to

00:01:11.270 --> 00:01:11.280 
it's simply just a piece of cardboard to

00:01:11.280 --> 00:01:13.279 
it's simply just a piece of cardboard to
kind<00:01:11.520> of<00:01:11.580> come<00:01:11.700> up<00:01:11.850> with<00:01:11.880> a<00:01:12.300> measurement

00:01:13.279 --> 00:01:13.289 
kind of come up with a measurement

00:01:13.289 --> 00:01:15.980 
kind of come up with a measurement
design<00:01:13.800> to<00:01:14.759> see<00:01:14.970> what<00:01:15.149> will<00:01:15.300> work<00:01:15.509> how<00:01:15.810> it's

00:01:15.980 --> 00:01:15.990 
design to see what will work how it's

00:01:15.990 --> 00:01:19.160 
design to see what will work how it's
going<00:01:16.140> to<00:01:16.200> look<00:01:16.410> and<00:01:17.030> I<00:01:18.030> took<00:01:18.090> some<00:01:18.539> scrap

00:01:19.160 --> 00:01:19.170 
going to look and I took some scrap

00:01:19.170 --> 00:01:20.840 
going to look and I took some scrap
pieces<00:01:19.440> of<00:01:19.619> wood<00:01:19.800> to<00:01:20.250> kind<00:01:20.430> of<00:01:20.520> come<00:01:20.670> up<00:01:20.820> with

00:01:20.840 --> 00:01:20.850 
pieces of wood to kind of come up with

00:01:20.850 --> 00:01:24.740 
pieces of wood to kind of come up with
all<00:01:21.210> the<00:01:21.390> angles<00:01:22.759> so<00:01:23.759> we've<00:01:23.910> got<00:01:24.060> like<00:01:24.300> you

00:01:24.740 --> 00:01:24.750 
all the angles so we've got like you

00:01:24.750 --> 00:01:27.430 
all the angles so we've got like you
know<00:01:24.840> 25<00:01:25.320> angles<00:01:25.740> in<00:01:25.860> the<00:01:25.950> corners<00:01:26.310> down<00:01:26.490> here

00:01:27.430 --> 00:01:27.440 
know 25 angles in the corners down here

00:01:27.440 --> 00:01:30.710 
know 25 angles in the corners down here
these<00:01:28.440> are<00:01:28.500> 45<00:01:29.070> straight<00:01:29.460> zeros<00:01:30.000> and<00:01:30.360> then<00:01:30.630> we

00:01:30.710 --> 00:01:30.720 
these are 45 straight zeros and then we

00:01:30.720 --> 00:01:33.830 
these are 45 straight zeros and then we
have<00:01:30.840> a<00:01:30.869> 40<00:01:31.259> in<00:01:31.380> the<00:01:31.500> top<00:01:32.450> so<00:01:33.450> this<00:01:33.570> is<00:01:33.750> the

00:01:33.830 --> 00:01:33.840 
have a 40 in the top so this is the

00:01:33.840 --> 00:02:39.410 
have a 40 in the top so this is the
design<00:01:34.200> so<00:01:34.500> let's<00:01:34.679> get<00:01:34.800> started

00:02:39.410 --> 00:02:39.420 

00:02:39.420 --> 00:02:43.199 

now<00:02:40.420> I'm<00:02:40.569> adding<00:02:40.930> an<00:02:41.019> extra<00:02:41.380> layer<00:02:41.890> of<00:02:41.920> wood<00:02:42.670> to

00:02:43.199 --> 00:02:43.209 
now I'm adding an extra layer of wood to

00:02:43.209 --> 00:02:46.590 
now I'm adding an extra layer of wood to
the<00:02:43.330> outside<00:02:43.750> of<00:02:44.220> the<00:02:45.220> enclosure<00:02:45.580> and<00:02:45.819> what

00:02:46.590 --> 00:02:46.600 
the outside of the enclosure and what

00:02:46.600 --> 00:02:48.240 
the outside of the enclosure and what
I'm<00:02:46.690> doing<00:02:46.900> with<00:02:47.019> the<00:02:47.140> holes<00:02:47.440> I'm<00:02:47.739> just<00:02:47.920> simply

00:02:48.240 --> 00:02:48.250 
I'm doing with the holes I'm just simply

00:02:48.250 --> 00:02:50.009 
I'm doing with the holes I'm just simply
cutting<00:02:48.700> them<00:02:48.910> a<00:02:48.940> little<00:02:49.390> bit<00:02:49.510> smaller<00:02:49.690> than

00:02:50.009 --> 00:02:50.019 
cutting them a little bit smaller than

00:02:50.019 --> 00:02:52.650 
cutting them a little bit smaller than
the<00:02:50.290> original<00:02:50.709> hole<00:02:51.030> and<00:02:52.030> then<00:02:52.180> I'm<00:02:52.299> using<00:02:52.420> a

00:02:52.650 --> 00:02:52.660 
the original hole and then I'm using a

00:02:52.660 --> 00:02:56.130 
the original hole and then I'm using a
flush<00:02:52.930> trim<00:02:53.140> bit<00:02:53.260> on<00:02:54.130> the<00:02:54.370> router<00:02:54.580> to<00:02:55.450> pair<00:02:55.930> up

00:02:56.130 --> 00:02:56.140 
flush trim bit on the router to pair up

00:02:56.140 --> 00:02:59.400 
flush trim bit on the router to pair up
those<00:02:56.319> holes<00:02:57.030> also<00:02:58.030> the<00:02:58.180> joints<00:02:58.599> are<00:02:58.720> going<00:02:59.019> to

00:02:59.400 --> 00:02:59.410 
those holes also the joints are going to

00:02:59.410 --> 00:03:03.229 
those holes also the joints are going to
get<00:02:59.650> overlapped<00:03:00.519> so<00:03:00.880> that<00:03:01.540> will<00:03:01.630> help<00:03:01.780> the

00:03:03.229 --> 00:03:03.239 
get overlapped so that will help the

00:03:03.239 --> 00:03:06.479 
get overlapped so that will help the
strength<00:03:04.239> in<00:03:04.540> the<00:03:04.720> corners<00:03:05.190> and<00:03:06.190> then<00:03:06.340> we'll

00:03:06.479 --> 00:03:06.489 
strength in the corners and then we'll

00:03:06.489 --> 00:04:19.759 
strength in the corners and then we'll
be<00:03:06.609> adding<00:03:06.640> some<00:03:06.970> additional<00:03:07.510> bracing

00:04:19.759 --> 00:04:19.769 

00:04:19.769 --> 00:04:22.350 

all<00:04:20.769> right<00:04:20.919> so<00:04:21.070> pretty<00:04:21.340> much<00:04:21.489> got<00:04:21.699> all<00:04:22.060> of<00:04:22.270> the

00:04:22.350 --> 00:04:22.360 
all right so pretty much got all of the

00:04:22.360 --> 00:04:26.629 
all right so pretty much got all of the
bracing<00:04:22.780> done<00:04:22.960> and<00:04:23.699> everything's<00:04:24.699> fitted<00:04:25.660> so

00:04:26.629 --> 00:04:26.639 
bracing done and everything's fitted so

00:04:26.639 --> 00:04:29.640 
bracing done and everything's fitted so
you've<00:04:27.639> got<00:04:27.790> one<00:04:28.060> of<00:04:28.210> two<00:04:28.449> front<00:04:28.870> boards<00:04:29.470> on

00:04:29.640 --> 00:04:29.650 
you've got one of two front boards on

00:04:29.650 --> 00:04:31.439 
you've got one of two front boards on
and<00:04:30.039> then<00:04:30.430> the<00:04:30.550> next<00:04:30.820> video

00:04:31.439 --> 00:04:31.449 
and then the next video

00:04:31.449 --> 00:04:34.070 
and then the next video
I'll<00:04:31.600> be<00:04:31.990> taking<00:04:32.199> some<00:04:32.520> three<00:04:33.520> inch<00:04:33.550> PVC

00:04:34.070 --> 00:04:34.080 
I'll be taking some three inch PVC

00:04:34.080 --> 00:04:37.740 
I'll be taking some three inch PVC
cutting<00:04:35.080> it<00:04:35.169> in<00:04:35.260> half<00:04:35.289> and<00:04:35.770> making<00:04:36.070> a<00:04:36.750> round

00:04:37.740 --> 00:04:37.750 
cutting it in half and making a round

00:04:37.750 --> 00:04:40.980 
cutting it in half and making a round
over<00:04:38.639> plate<00:04:39.639> to<00:04:39.880> go<00:04:40.000> on<00:04:40.150> the<00:04:40.240> front<00:04:40.539> here<00:04:40.780> so

00:04:40.980 --> 00:04:40.990 
over plate to go on the front here so

00:04:40.990 --> 00:04:44.580 
over plate to go on the front here so
we'll<00:04:41.620> do<00:04:41.770> that<00:04:41.889> on<00:04:41.949> the<00:04:42.039> next<00:04:42.340> video
