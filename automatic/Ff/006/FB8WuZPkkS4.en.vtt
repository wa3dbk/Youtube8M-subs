00:00:21.770 --> 00:00:32.510
When I was just a little girl

00:00:33.390 --> 00:00:38.640
I asked my mother

00:00:39.260 --> 00:00:47.200
what will I be

00:00:48.320 --> 00:00:53.640
Will I be pretty

00:00:54.200 --> 00:00:59.580
will I be rich

00:01:00.790 --> 00:01:09.330
Here's what she said to me

00:01:10.260 --> 00:01:19.570
Que Sera, Sera

00:01:20.450 --> 00:01:30.390
Whatever will be, will be

00:01:32.260 --> 00:01:43.780
The future's not ours, to see

00:01:43.760 --> 00:01:55.260
Que Sera, Sera

00:01:55.830 --> 00:02:05.580
What will be, will be

00:02:09.950 --> 00:02:20.890
Now I have children of my own

00:02:21.450 --> 00:02:26.760
They ask their mother

00:02:27.330 --> 00:02:35.390
what will I be

00:02:36.140 --> 00:02:41.320
Will I be handsome

00:02:41.830 --> 00:02:46.700
will I be rich

00:02:47.390 --> 00:02:56.790
I tell them tenderly

00:02:56.950 --> 00:03:05.450
Que Sera, Sera

00:03:06.200 --> 00:03:16.390
Whatever will be, will be

00:03:17.330 --> 00:03:26.950
The future's not ours, to see

00:03:27.760 --> 00:03:38.260
Que Sera, Sera

00:03:38.890 --> 00:03:48.890
What will be, will be
