in<00:00:06.779> this<00:00:07.020> tutorial<00:00:07.259> you<00:00:08.160> learn<00:00:08.340> how<00:00:08.580> the<00:00:08.610> movie

00:00:09.049 --> 00:00:09.059 
in this tutorial you learn how the movie

00:00:09.059 --> 00:00:11.060 
in this tutorial you learn how the movie
trailer<00:00:09.510> that<00:00:09.690> proceeds<00:00:10.200> every<00:00:10.620> movie<00:00:10.950> on

00:00:11.060 --> 00:00:11.070 
trailer that proceeds every movie on

00:00:11.070 --> 00:00:14.390 
trailer that proceeds every movie on
this<00:00:11.219> channel<00:00:11.580> was<00:00:11.910> created<00:00:13.009> you<00:00:14.009> will<00:00:14.099> not<00:00:14.219> be

00:00:14.390 --> 00:00:14.400 
this channel was created you will not be

00:00:14.400 --> 00:00:16.400 
this channel was created you will not be
using<00:00:14.549> the<00:00:14.759> same<00:00:15.030> assets<00:00:15.540> though<00:00:15.780> but<00:00:16.199> rather

00:00:16.400 --> 00:00:16.410 
using the same assets though but rather

00:00:16.410 --> 00:00:19.040 
using the same assets though but rather
starting<00:00:16.949> from<00:00:17.100> scratch<00:00:17.570> this<00:00:18.570> allows<00:00:18.869> you<00:00:19.020> to

00:00:19.040 --> 00:00:19.050 
starting from scratch this allows you to

00:00:19.050 --> 00:00:21.170 
starting from scratch this allows you to
work<00:00:19.320> on<00:00:19.500> a<00:00:19.560> simpler<00:00:19.980> scene<00:00:20.220> which<00:00:20.789> always

00:00:21.170 --> 00:00:21.180 
work on a simpler scene which always

00:00:21.180 --> 00:00:24.439 
work on a simpler scene which always
makes<00:00:21.390> learning<00:00:21.720> easier<00:00:22.910> in<00:00:23.910> this<00:00:24.180> first

00:00:24.439 --> 00:00:24.449 
makes learning easier in this first

the default set the display units to

00:00:42.750 --> 00:00:45.139 
the default set the display units to

00:00:45.139 --> 00:00:45.149 
meters as it's easier to get a sense of

00:00:45.149 --> 00:00:48.889 
meters as it's easier to get a sense of
scale<00:00:45.450> that<00:00:45.780> way<00:00:46.550> ultimately<00:00:47.690> you'll<00:00:48.690> be

00:00:48.889 --> 00:00:48.899 
scale that way ultimately you'll be

00:00:48.899 --> 00:00:50.959 
scale that way ultimately you'll be
using<00:00:49.050> mental<00:00:49.590> ray<00:00:49.800> to<00:00:49.860> render<00:00:50.280> this<00:00:50.399> project

00:00:50.959 --> 00:00:50.969 
using mental ray to render this project

00:00:50.969 --> 00:00:53.119 
using mental ray to render this project
so<00:00:51.629> you<00:00:51.750> may<00:00:51.899> as<00:00:52.050> well<00:00:52.079> set<00:00:52.469> mental<00:00:52.860> ray<00:00:52.949> as<00:00:53.100> a

00:00:53.119 --> 00:00:53.129 
so you may as well set mental ray as a

00:00:53.129 --> 00:00:55.910 
so you may as well set mental ray as a
