that<00:03:03.250> to<00:03:03.459> you<00:03:03.610> make<00:03:03.760> sure<00:03:03.790> you<00:03:04.000> got<00:03:04.120> a<00:03:04.150> flush

00:03:04.620 --> 00:03:04.630 
that to you make sure you got a flush

00:03:04.630 --> 00:03:09.870 
that to you make sure you got a flush
flat<00:03:05.489> level<00:03:06.489> in<00:03:06.730> you<00:03:07.150> put<00:03:07.390> up<00:03:07.510> your<00:03:08.519> your<00:03:09.519> hand

up<00:03:10.420> against<00:03:10.780> there<00:03:11.170> make<00:03:11.620> sure<00:03:11.650> it's<00:03:11.980> straight

00:03:12.360 --> 00:03:12.370 
up against there make sure it's straight

00:03:12.370 --> 00:03:15.030 
up against there make sure it's straight
and<00:03:13.060> you<00:03:13.360> see<00:03:13.600> if<00:03:14.050> you're<00:03:14.170> going<00:03:14.290> to<00:03:14.410> gaps<00:03:14.650> or

00:03:15.030 --> 00:03:15.040 
and you see if you're going to gaps or

00:03:15.040 --> 00:03:17.009 
and you see if you're going to gaps or
anything<00:03:15.220> in<00:03:15.610> any<00:03:15.790> way<00:03:16.000> I<00:03:16.269> had<00:03:16.570> a<00:03:16.600> few<00:03:16.810> gaps

00:03:17.009 --> 00:03:17.019 
anything in any way I had a few gaps

00:03:17.019 --> 00:03:20.360 
anything in any way I had a few gaps
here<00:03:17.290> so<00:03:17.440> I<00:03:17.470> had<00:03:17.560> to<00:03:17.680> float<00:03:17.890> in<00:03:18.070> a<00:03:18.130> little<00:03:18.370> epoxy

00:03:20.360 --> 00:03:20.370 
here so I had to float in a little epoxy

00:03:20.370 --> 00:03:23.940 
here so I had to float in a little epoxy
in<00:03:21.370> a<00:03:21.430> few<00:03:21.790> places<00:03:21.910> get<00:03:22.840> it<00:03:22.959> all<00:03:23.110> nice<00:03:23.350> and<00:03:23.410> flat

00:03:23.940 --> 00:03:23.950 
in a few places get it all nice and flat

00:03:23.950 --> 00:03:30.210 
in a few places get it all nice and flat
I<00:03:24.310> used<00:03:25.000> a<00:03:25.180> Sika<00:03:25.630> Sika<00:03:26.580> Sika<00:03:28.950> epoxy<00:03:29.950> pretty

00:03:30.210 --> 00:03:30.220 
I used a Sika Sika Sika epoxy pretty

00:03:30.220 --> 00:03:33.979 
I used a Sika Sika Sika epoxy pretty
good<00:03:30.459> stuff<00:03:30.790> over<00:03:31.330> there<00:03:31.650> one<00:03:32.650> part<00:03:33.070> the<00:03:33.250> to

00:03:33.979 --> 00:03:33.989 
good stuff over there one part the to

00:03:33.989 --> 00:03:45.050 
good stuff over there one part the to
see<00:03:34.989> just<00:03:35.290> like<00:03:35.709> that<00:03:35.769> some<00:03:36.220> number

00:03:45.050 --> 00:03:45.060 

00:03:45.060 --> 00:03:48.900 

31<00:03:46.060> she<00:03:46.570> could<00:03:46.750> 231<00:03:47.470> that's<00:03:48.070> part<00:03:48.430> b<00:03:48.670> that's

00:03:48.900 --> 00:03:48.910 
31 she could 231 that's part b that's

00:03:48.910 --> 00:03:55.860 
31 she could 231 that's part b that's
part<00:03:49.300> a<00:03:49.530> read<00:03:50.530> the<00:03:50.680> instructions<00:03:51.960> anyway<00:03:54.870> so

00:03:55.860 --> 00:03:55.870 
part a read the instructions anyway so

00:03:55.870 --> 00:03:58.920 
part a read the instructions anyway so
afterwards<00:03:56.860> that<00:03:57.240> floated<00:03:58.240> this<00:03:58.360> side<00:03:58.690> with

00:03:58.920 --> 00:03:58.930 
afterwards that floated this side with

00:03:58.930 --> 00:04:02.160 
afterwards that floated this side with
epoxy<00:03:59.290> two<00:03:59.740> floated<00:04:00.310> this<00:04:00.460> to<00:04:00.810> the<00:04:01.810> holes<00:04:02.020> were

00:04:02.160 --> 00:04:02.170 
epoxy two floated this to the holes were

00:04:02.170 --> 00:04:04.310 
epoxy two floated this to the holes were
drilled<00:04:02.200> and<00:04:02.530> popped<00:04:02.770> out<00:04:02.950> the<00:04:03.130> other<00:04:03.250> side

00:04:04.310 --> 00:04:04.320 
drilled and popped out the other side

00:04:04.320 --> 00:04:06.810 
drilled and popped out the other side
squared<00:04:05.320> um<00:04:05.500> you<00:04:05.650> can<00:04:05.830> look<00:04:06.010> good<00:04:06.190> it<00:04:06.430> seems<00:04:06.700> to

00:04:06.810 --> 00:04:06.820 
squared um you can look good it seems to

00:04:06.820 --> 00:04:12.900 
squared um you can look good it seems to
work<00:04:06.970> good<00:04:10.050> that's<00:04:11.050> going<00:04:11.350> out<00:04:11.530> in<00:04:11.770> here<00:04:12.160> but

00:04:12.900 --> 00:04:12.910 
work good that's going out in here but

00:04:12.910 --> 00:04:17.729 
work good that's going out in here but
review<00:04:13.390> the<00:04:13.630> arrogant<00:04:14.530> now<00:04:14.740> aggregates<00:04:16.739> you

got to get the right balance aggregates

00:04:19.860 --> 00:04:23.760 
got to get the right balance aggregates
or<00:04:20.860> you<00:04:21.010> have<00:04:21.130> a<00:04:21.160> weaker<00:04:21.520> concrete<00:04:22.770> conference

00:04:23.760 --> 00:04:23.770 
or you have a weaker concrete conference

00:04:23.770 --> 00:04:25.320 
or you have a weaker concrete conference
packed<00:04:24.040> more<00:04:24.340> harder<00:04:24.670> to<00:04:24.760> get<00:04:24.910> in<00:04:25.000> a<00:04:25.060> pan<00:04:25.300> or
