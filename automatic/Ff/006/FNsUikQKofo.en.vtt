00:00:08.769 --> 00:00:13.860
 My name is Matías Rodríguez and I want 

00:00:10.959 --> 00:00:17.070
 be a warrior in this war 

00:00:13.860 --> 00:00:18.960
 many of my friends my colleges and 

00:00:17.070 --> 00:00:21.340
 partners ask me the same thing because 

00:00:18.960 --> 00:00:24.080
 I want to be a warrior 

00:00:21.340 --> 00:00:27.020
 I think the question I think are 

00:00:24.080 --> 00:00:28.789
 it should be because it is not because it is not 

00:00:27.020 --> 00:00:30.699
 be a warrior 

00:00:28.789 --> 00:00:33.630
 well I think we live in a world 

00:00:30.699 --> 00:00:36.770
 currently where 

00:00:33.630 --> 00:00:40.340
 they force you to become a person 

00:00:36.770 --> 00:00:40.340
 who does not want to be 

00:00:40.480 --> 00:00:44.040
 there are so many stupid rules of 

00:00:42.760 --> 00:00:46.140
 through 

00:00:44.040 --> 00:00:47.450
 that people do not do not do not take the time 

00:00:46.140 --> 00:00:50.470

00:00:47.450 --> 00:00:53.930
