00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.670
 Hi , welcome. How can you repair this video? 

00:00:03.600 --> 00:00:07.919
 will sign how to open the door of your 

00:00:05.670 --> 00:00:10.920
 washing machine when it has failed 

00:00:07.919 --> 00:00:13.139
 the opening failure to handle failure 

00:00:10.920 --> 00:00:16.099
 latch or for any reason not 

00:00:13.139 --> 00:00:16.099
 can you open the 

00:00:16.970 --> 00:00:22.380
 What we are using here is a piece of 

00:00:20.250 --> 00:00:25.740
 fishing line per 50 kilos of weight 

00:00:22.380 --> 00:00:27.990
 can use fine gold a rope of 

00:00:25.740 --> 00:00:29.810
 instrument although the latter is the 

00:00:27.990 --> 00:00:32.759
 most suitable for this job 

00:00:29.810 --> 00:00:35.520
 on this machine or nobody knocks on the door 

00:00:32.759 --> 00:00:37.020
 closed and basically lock in the direction 

00:00:35.520 --> 00:00:38.760
 external machine 

00:00:37.020 --> 00:00:41.390
 so we need to close with nobody 

00:00:38.760 --> 00:00:44.730
 of the brand's internal direction 

00:00:41.390 --> 00:00:45.600
 carefully puts surf fishing back 

00:00:44.730 --> 00:00:49.800
 of the door 

00:00:45.600 --> 00:00:52.440
 pull if it will open there document see 

00:00:49.800 --> 00:00:54.480
 the other videos to know how to base 

00:00:52.440 --> 00:00:57.469
 machine when it is full of 

00:00:54.480 --> 00:00:57.469
 water and linen 

00:00:58.670 --> 00:01:04.080
 this machine on which we are working 

00:01:01.079 --> 00:01:07.460
 is bosch brand that the same manufacturer 

00:01:04.080 --> 00:01:07.460
 NFA on 

00:01:25.970 --> 00:01:30.450
 Can you come here? 

00:01:27.870 --> 00:01:32.010
 the two small bathrooms these will 

00:01:30.450 --> 00:01:34.620
 to intervene in this task 

00:01:32.010 --> 00:01:37.110
 we can slightly divert the door 

00:01:34.620 --> 00:01:39.830
 hitched anyone suspicious fishing and 

00:01:37.110 --> 00:01:39.830
 pulled 

00:01:48.350 --> 00:01:54.630
 none of these trading tips 

00:01:51.660 --> 00:01:56.550
 another more complicated technique will be 

00:01:54.630 --> 00:01:58.020
 disconnect the power cord from the 

00:01:56.550 --> 00:02:00.450
 electrical outlet 

00:01:58.020 --> 00:02:03.900
 water supply train all 

00:02:00.450 --> 00:02:06.090
 water holding the lid tilt the 

00:02:03.900 --> 00:02:08.190
 machine from Trofense with the help of 

00:02:06.090 --> 00:02:11.750
 Someone because they will have to work with 

00:02:08.190 --> 00:02:11.750
 the inner part of the machine 

00:02:26.490 --> 00:02:31.570
 we are showing this technique in this 

00:02:29.050 --> 00:02:35.820
 machine a number of times and how can 

00:02:31.570 --> 00:02:35.820
 see the exchange link outside 

00:02:38.370 --> 00:02:44.620
 while on this tractor next to 

00:02:41.260 --> 00:02:46.750
 within the next technique we will show 

00:02:44.620 --> 00:02:47.680
 has to do with inner work of the 

00:02:46.750 --> 00:02:50.380
 machine 

00:02:47.680 --> 00:02:54.180
 so bring it make it turn it off two 

00:02:50.380 --> 00:02:56.590
 and also from the electrical outlet. 

00:02:54.180 --> 00:03:00.520
 many of the latches have a cover 

00:02:56.590 --> 00:03:02.230
 How can you come here and silo life is another 

00:03:00.520 --> 00:03:04.540
 so to remove anything is 

00:03:02.230 --> 00:03:06.220
 important in view of the organic 

00:03:04.540 --> 00:03:08.110
 machine and so you do not have to 

00:03:06.220 --> 00:03:14.290
 be very concerned if this coverage 

00:03:08.110 --> 00:03:16.360
 damage but this will be what will 

00:03:14.290 --> 00:03:19.120
 what to do if you carry out the work 

00:03:16.360 --> 00:03:20.160
 inside the machine will have to tilt the 

00:03:19.120 --> 00:03:22.570
 machine 

00:03:20.160 --> 00:03:24.670
 we advise you how to see coverage for 

00:03:22.570 --> 00:03:26.830
 take it further and you will need a 

00:03:24.670 --> 00:03:29.680
 screwdriver for using this part 

00:03:26.830 --> 00:03:31.830
 that does not want portion- based what is a 

00:03:29.680 --> 00:03:31.830
 advantage 

00:03:36.360 --> 00:03:43.090
 Good luck at work for opening the door. 

00:03:39.010 --> 00:03:44.920
