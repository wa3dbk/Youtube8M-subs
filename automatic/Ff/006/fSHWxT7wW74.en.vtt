00:01:28.789 --> 00:01:28.799 
mine down here by the seatbelt if you

00:01:28.799 --> 00:01:32.420 
mine down here by the seatbelt if you
guys<00:01:28.920> can<00:01:29.130> see<00:01:29.600> just<00:01:30.600> slip<00:01:30.900> it<00:01:31.049> in<00:01:31.170> slip<00:01:31.430> and

00:01:32.420 --> 00:01:32.430 
guys can see just slip it in slip and

00:01:32.430 --> 00:01:34.370 
guys can see just slip it in slip and
right<00:01:32.579> there<00:01:32.790> so<00:01:33.060> my<00:01:33.659> seatbelt<00:01:34.049> doesn't

00:01:34.370 --> 00:01:34.380 
right there so my seatbelt doesn't

00:01:34.380 --> 00:01:36.469 
right there so my seatbelt doesn't
release<00:01:34.619> it's<00:01:34.829> right<00:01:35.549> there<00:01:35.850> so<00:01:36.119> let's<00:01:36.270> try<00:01:36.420> to

00:01:36.469 --> 00:01:36.479 
release it's right there so let's try to

00:01:36.479 --> 00:01:38.330 
release it's right there so let's try to
slip<00:01:36.930> and<00:01:37.140> I<00:01:37.350> think<00:01:37.680> it's<00:01:37.799> a<00:01:37.829> lot<00:01:37.950> better<00:01:38.100> if

00:01:38.330 --> 00:01:38.340 
slip and I think it's a lot better if

00:01:38.340 --> 00:01:40.609 
slip and I think it's a lot better if
you<00:01:38.430> go<00:01:38.759> a<00:01:38.790> roll<00:01:39.150> over<00:01:39.479> you<00:01:40.200> know<00:01:40.290> these<00:01:40.409> PI's

00:01:40.609 --> 00:01:40.619 
you go a roll over you know these PI's

00:01:40.619 --> 00:01:43.130 
you go a roll over you know these PI's
are<00:01:40.829> things<00:01:41.009> might<00:01:41.250> fly<00:01:42.090> you<00:01:42.299> know<00:01:42.390> fly<00:01:42.960> out<00:01:43.049> of

00:01:43.130 --> 00:01:43.140 
are things might fly you know fly out of

00:01:43.140 --> 00:01:44.840 
are things might fly you know fly out of
your<00:01:43.200> car<00:01:43.500> but<00:01:43.710> get<00:01:43.950> this<00:01:44.130> organized<00:01:44.610> or

00:01:44.840 --> 00:01:44.850 
your car but get this organized or

00:01:44.850 --> 00:01:46.789 
your car but get this organized or
whatnot<00:01:45.000> and<00:01:45.450> that's<00:01:46.079> this<00:01:46.229> always<00:01:46.560> going<00:01:46.770> to

00:01:46.789 --> 00:01:46.799 
whatnot and that's this always going to

00:01:46.799 --> 00:01:48.800 
whatnot and that's this always going to
be<00:01:46.860> right<00:01:47.430> where<00:01:47.729> your<00:01:47.880> seat<00:01:48.060> belt<00:01:48.299> releases

00:01:48.800 --> 00:01:48.810 
be right where your seat belt releases

00:01:50.749 --> 00:01:50.759 
so it doesn't work grab it but anyways
