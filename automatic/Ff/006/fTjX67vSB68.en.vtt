edge<00:03:19.920> right<00:03:20.190> when<00:03:20.459> he<00:03:20.519> caught<00:03:20.700> that<00:03:20.880> there<00:03:21.120> but

00:03:21.979 --> 00:03:21.989 
edge right when he caught that there but

00:03:21.989 --> 00:03:23.990 
edge right when he caught that there but
after<00:03:22.470> catching<00:03:22.950> the<00:03:23.190> daring<00:03:23.459> he<00:03:23.609> knew<00:03:23.790> that

00:03:23.990 --> 00:03:24.000 
after catching the daring he knew that

00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:26.000 
after catching the daring he knew that
there<00:03:24.180> would<00:03:24.299> be<00:03:24.329> enough<00:03:24.750> stun<00:03:25.079> on<00:03:25.319> the<00:03:25.680> doctor

00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:26.010 
there would be enough stun on the doctor

00:03:26.010 --> 00:03:29.090 
there would be enough stun on the doctor
Mario<00:03:26.340> for<00:03:26.760> him<00:03:26.910> to<00:03:27.120> like<00:03:27.389> -<00:03:27.989> through<00:03:28.470> him<00:03:28.769> and

00:03:29.090 --> 00:03:29.100 
Mario for him to like - through him and

00:03:29.100 --> 00:03:32.300 
Mario for him to like - through him and
then<00:03:29.549> pivot<00:03:29.970> grab<00:03:30.359> basically<00:03:31.109> then<00:03:31.680> he'd<00:03:32.280> be

00:03:32.300 --> 00:03:32.310 
then pivot grab basically then he'd be

00:03:32.310 --> 00:03:34.670 
then pivot grab basically then he'd be
able<00:03:32.459> to<00:03:32.940> well<00:03:33.690> I<00:03:33.720> think<00:03:33.840> he<00:03:34.079> just<00:03:34.260> -<00:03:34.440> dance

00:03:34.670 --> 00:03:34.680 
able to well I think he just - dance

00:03:34.680 --> 00:03:36.710 
able to well I think he just - dance
grab<00:03:34.889> on<00:03:35.069> the<00:03:35.130> other<00:03:35.250> side<00:03:35.459> he<00:03:35.579> dared<00:03:35.850> -<00:03:36.389> to<00:03:36.630> the

00:03:36.710 --> 00:03:36.720 
grab on the other side he dared - to the

00:03:36.720 --> 00:03:38.990 
grab on the other side he dared - to the
other<00:03:36.840> side<00:03:37.139> and<00:03:37.260> grabbed<00:03:37.500> them<00:03:37.709> and<00:03:37.859> then<00:03:38.519> did

00:03:38.990 --> 00:03:39.000 
other side and grabbed them and then did

00:03:39.000 --> 00:03:40.580 
other side and grabbed them and then did
his<00:03:39.120> combo<00:03:39.420> which<00:03:39.540> was<00:03:39.660> so<00:03:39.810> smart<00:03:40.139> because<00:03:40.260> if

00:03:40.580 --> 00:03:40.590 
his combo which was so smart because if

00:03:40.590 --> 00:03:42.440 
his combo which was so smart because if
he<00:03:40.920> didn't<00:03:41.280> do<00:03:41.370> that<00:03:41.519> you'd<00:03:41.850> have<00:03:42.030> to<00:03:42.060> combo

00:03:42.440 --> 00:03:42.450 
he didn't do that you'd have to combo

00:03:42.450 --> 00:03:45.440 
he didn't do that you'd have to combo
him<00:03:42.569> from<00:03:42.810> the<00:03:42.989> one<00:03:43.139> side<00:03:43.290> of
