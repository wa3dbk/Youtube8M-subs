the<00:01:42.869> key<00:01:43.049> taps<00:01:43.320> and<00:01:43.530> stuff<00:01:43.770> which<00:01:43.979> is<00:01:44.009> really

00:01:44.480 --> 00:01:44.490 
the key taps and stuff which is really

00:01:44.490 --> 00:01:47.420 
the key taps and stuff which is really
kind<00:01:44.880> of<00:01:45.000> irritating<00:01:45.540> but<00:01:46.229> you<00:01:46.560> know<00:01:46.710> well

00:01:47.420 --> 00:01:47.430 
kind of irritating but you know well

00:01:47.430 --> 00:01:49.460 
kind of irritating but you know well
it's<00:01:48.329> mainly<00:01:48.509> because<00:01:48.720> of<00:01:48.810> the<00:01:48.990> positioning

00:01:49.460 --> 00:01:49.470 
it's mainly because of the positioning

00:01:49.470 --> 00:01:50.660 
it's mainly because of the positioning
if<00:01:49.649> it's<00:01:49.799> in<00:01:49.890> a<00:01:49.920> better<00:01:50.040> position<00:01:50.250> to<00:01:50.579> be

00:01:50.660 --> 00:01:50.670 
if it's in a better position to be

00:01:50.670 --> 00:01:52.069 
if it's in a better position to be
better<00:01:51.000> if<00:01:51.210> I<00:01:51.299> the<00:01:51.360> shock<00:01:51.570> mount<00:01:51.810> as<00:01:51.930> well

00:01:52.069 --> 00:01:52.079 
better if I the shock mount as well

00:01:52.079 --> 00:01:55.340 
better if I the shock mount as well
things<00:01:52.320> like<00:01:52.439> that<00:01:53.030> um<00:01:54.110> overall<00:01:55.110> it's<00:01:55.259> a

00:01:55.340 --> 00:01:55.350 
things like that um overall it's a

00:01:55.350 --> 00:01:56.959 
things like that um overall it's a
pretty<00:01:55.380> right<00:01:55.710> keyboard<00:01:55.920> but<00:01:56.250> the<00:01:56.340> key<00:01:56.670> like

00:01:56.959 --> 00:01:56.969 
pretty right keyboard but the key like

00:01:56.969 --> 00:02:01.030 
pretty right keyboard but the key like
the<00:01:57.689> way<00:01:57.869> it<00:01:58.020> presses<00:01:58.469> kind<00:01:58.950> of<00:01:59.040> sucks

00:02:01.030 --> 00:02:01.040 
the way it presses kind of sucks

00:02:01.040 --> 00:02:04.330 
the way it presses kind of sucks
like<00:02:01.750> it's<00:02:02.750> really<00:02:03.230> hard<00:02:03.500> to<00:02:03.590> get<00:02:03.680> used<00:02:03.890> to

00:02:04.330 --> 00:02:04.340
