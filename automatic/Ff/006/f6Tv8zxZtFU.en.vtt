00:00:00.329 --> 00:00:02.790
 like half of the indications we have 

00:00:02.790 --> 00:00:05.870
 to travel ida real night agents 

00:00:05.870 --> 00:00:08.949
 after work shows 

00:00:08.949 --> 00:00:12.319
 if we compare keeping the proportions in what was his experience I think that 

00:00:12.319 --> 00:00:14.209
 it can be the experience of a young savings 

00:00:14.209 --> 00:00:16.349
 We are talking about young people now because 

00:00:16.349 --> 00:00:21.489
 there is a lot of temptation overflowed police that you are soriano what can 

00:00:21.489 --> 00:00:23.779
 make a young artist who wants to live 

00:00:23.779 --> 00:00:26.239
 opting out 

00:00:26.239 --> 00:00:30.659
 first you would have is that you have to try to define what it means to be 

00:00:30.659 --> 00:00:31.519
 young 

00:00:31.519 --> 00:00:34.100
 then young people who act like old 

00:00:34.100 --> 00:00:36.740
 some old people who die young 

00:00:36.740 --> 00:00:40.090
 in youth it is a state of the soul to more than a biological issue 

00:00:41.270 --> 00:00:45.350
 there are not many young people who do not want anything with the establishment or the 

00:00:45.350 --> 00:00:46.109
 work 

00:00:46.109 --> 00:00:48.840
 he has no hope he has no enthusiasm 

00:00:48.840 --> 00:00:50.470
 and they are finished 

00:00:50.470 --> 00:00:53.920
 and this is possibly looking for the sensory with a leak 

00:00:55.030 --> 00:00:56.750
 in youth it is a state of the soul 

00:00:56.750 --> 00:00:59.530
 but we talk about that leap that is presented to us 

00:00:59.530 --> 00:01:03.660
 the jump is nothing more than building the bridge and today I do not think about if you want 

00:01:03.660 --> 00:01:05.680
 take the leap, but build bridges 

00:01:05.680 --> 00:01:06.860
 in TV 

00:01:06.860 --> 00:01:08.310
 what we are 

00:01:08.310 --> 00:01:10.280
 and how human we have 

00:01:10.280 --> 00:01:13.870
 pataky we have taken care of in the human thing the essential biological physics 

00:01:14.689 --> 00:01:17.710
 psychological mental and even spiritual 

00:01:18.660 --> 00:01:21.150
 but from transcendental 

00:01:21.150 --> 00:01:23.380
 and in the external of the sacred 

00:01:23.380 --> 00:01:26.290
 the secrets of the nature of our being 

00:01:26.290 --> 00:01:28.170
 Well, we do not know anything, it's more 

00:01:28.170 --> 00:01:31.329
 we will never know because it is not a matter of knowledge and knowledge 

00:01:31.329 --> 00:01:33.610
 it's a matter of experience 

00:01:33.610 --> 00:01:35.540
 you who can be a young 

00:01:35.540 --> 00:01:37.710
 is to conserve well 

00:01:37.710 --> 00:01:39.170
 with what account 

00:01:39.170 --> 00:01:40.630
 to live his life 

00:01:40.630 --> 00:01:43.250
 choreography counts its with a quarter 

00:01:43.250 --> 00:01:46.420
 the judge has to educate is a disciplinary body 

00:01:46.420 --> 00:01:49.570
 preparer in the same way that a car has to be tuned 

00:01:49.570 --> 00:01:50.820
 who wants to know 

00:01:50.820 --> 00:01:53.790
 you have to fear not fit for service 

00:01:53.790 --> 00:01:57.610
 Skype in your body that does not understand that you understand what your body wants 

00:01:57.610 --> 00:02:00.610
 his body was at a price of 17 million euros 

00:02:01.720 --> 00:02:05.160
 but I also think that one should assume bowls the fuel 

00:02:05.160 --> 00:02:06.480
 normally 

00:02:06.480 --> 00:02:09.299
 because the handle well the fuel 

00:02:09.299 --> 00:02:11.129
 the energy the chiquis 

00:02:11.129 --> 00:02:14.299
 the affects the station and the feelings all that 

00:02:14.299 --> 00:02:15.040
 carles 

00:02:15.040 --> 00:02:16.209
 I feel 

00:02:16.209 --> 00:02:17.809
 and after showing us 

00:02:17.809 --> 00:02:19.210
 according to your mind 

00:02:19.210 --> 00:02:23.249
 the road map where the trip is going for what motorsport is 

00:02:23.249 --> 00:02:26.600
 and then the sense of coexistence and relationship with all others 

00:02:26.600 --> 00:02:30.319
 but they could touch me was 2 6 kilometers per hour if I could 

00:02:30.319 --> 00:02:34.089
 but not only I'm not exposing I'm exposing a lot of people I have not 

00:02:34.089 --> 00:02:35.609
 been irresponsible 

00:02:35.609 --> 00:02:38.609
 seat in the sense of unity within diversity 

00:02:38.609 --> 00:02:40.719
 the famous 

00:02:40.719 --> 00:02:42.459
 july banesto 

00:02:42.459 --> 00:02:45.279
 in short the relationship with everyone else 

00:02:45.279 --> 00:02:49.099
 fraternity and years for the moment integration in ordino in 

00:02:49.099 --> 00:02:50.349
 the same and 

00:02:50.349 --> 00:02:53.399
 although there are other words solidarity 

00:02:53.399 --> 00:02:55.629
 the sense of solidarity 

00:02:55.629 --> 00:02:58.189
 your children in the only thing you have to do is 

00:02:58.189 --> 00:03:00.160
 is to stop so many theories 

00:03:00.160 --> 00:03:04.160
 and if these creations breathe deeply relax a little bit say good 

00:03:04.739 --> 00:03:06.449
 with what account 

00:03:06.449 --> 00:03:07.689
 with a game 

00:03:07.689 --> 00:03:10.089
 and then the cerebrospinal system 

00:03:10.089 --> 00:03:15.349
 to collect information because if I do not have objective direct information 

00:03:15.349 --> 00:03:16.690
 got to by myself 

00:03:16.690 --> 00:03:20.139
 this subject misinformation why today blindly 

00:03:20.139 --> 00:03:22.399
 rough and spinal irrigation systems 

00:03:22.399 --> 00:03:24.899
 quiet and clean and well developed 

00:03:24.899 --> 00:03:28.169
 to sense sensually with my senses 

00:03:28.169 --> 00:03:30.839
 what having 

00:03:30.839 --> 00:03:34.800
 I know that some are looking for sensory gratification 

00:03:34.800 --> 00:03:36.949
 and sensual yes 

00:03:36.949 --> 00:03:40.489
 that gratification and sensory and feel and sensual 

00:03:40.489 --> 00:03:45.469
 of a great return and without optimism that they are losing and in return this one does not 

00:03:45.469 --> 00:03:48.179
 be more common what more animals 

00:03:48.179 --> 00:03:49.519
 the most bestial 

00:03:49.519 --> 00:03:51.759
 Janice are losing the best of life 

00:03:51.759 --> 00:03:54.460
 it's not that we reject sensual sensory 

00:03:54.460 --> 00:03:57.460
 the material when you talk about your scheme 

00:03:58.709 --> 00:04:01.319
 without leaving the position 

00:04:01.319 --> 00:04:03.820
 the assembly had to decide 

00:04:03.820 --> 00:04:05.360
 sega waste 

00:04:05.360 --> 00:04:08.459
 are canceled according to animal to kill or die 

00:04:08.459 --> 00:04:09.849
 sex 

00:04:09.849 --> 00:04:11.849
 of violence 

00:04:11.849 --> 00:04:14.639
 houston and not the new being to 11 rivals 

00:04:14.639 --> 00:04:17.979
 we already have another parameter higher the reason 

00:04:17.979 --> 00:04:20.680
 spirituality the ability to love 

00:04:20.680 --> 00:04:23.250
 and without losing that we put it in huaraz 

00:04:23.250 --> 00:04:28.030
 so the maximum heights is an important one is not about getting rid of 

00:04:28.030 --> 00:04:29.219
 form 

00:04:29.219 --> 00:04:31.300
 the masochistic torpedo 

00:04:31.300 --> 00:04:32.949
 the pleasantness of life 

00:04:32.949 --> 00:04:35.620
 without getting something more pleasant life 

00:04:35.620 --> 00:04:37.090
 finest 

00:04:37.090 --> 00:04:41.690
 everything can rise present and did it in other levels because I do not ask 

00:04:41.690 --> 00:04:44.809
 the young people who renounce the gratification 

00:04:44.809 --> 00:04:46.949
 current referral 

00:04:46.949 --> 00:04:48.770
 look for something finer 

00:04:48.770 --> 00:04:52.349
 and that are willing to pay the price by leaning on the body 

00:04:52.349 --> 00:04:56.160
 and of course initially everything basically starts with the body 

00:04:56.160 --> 00:04:58.770
 the elections of wanting to build the house because of this fact 

00:04:58.770 --> 00:05:00.479
 Chinese next Monday 

00:05:00.479 --> 00:05:03.449
 look for a good port and the body is not negligible 

00:05:03.449 --> 00:05:07.259
 we have lived within a culture where he has taught us special to the body 

00:05:07.259 --> 00:05:10.110
 the body is nothing despicable all contrary 

00:05:10.110 --> 00:05:13.650
 it is a miracle this body besides this body is only matter 

00:05:13.650 --> 00:05:16.689
 organized be concentrated energy 

00:05:16.689 --> 00:05:18.639
 and active organic 

00:05:18.639 --> 00:05:21.039
 but also intelligence 

00:05:21.039 --> 00:05:24.039
 and it is also a spirit of unity and diversity 

00:05:24.039 --> 00:05:26.580
 everything we can think of the sublime 

00:05:26.580 --> 00:05:31.000
 is concentrated summarized odin and psychics and following the body press 

00:05:31.000 --> 00:05:33.659
 the base if the starting point 

00:05:33.659 --> 00:05:35.639
 for consciousness and for everything 

00:05:35.639 --> 00:05:38.770
 and from there we have to enter into the question of moral 

00:05:38.770 --> 00:05:41.940
 the psychic the energetic clear but based on what 

00:05:41.940 --> 00:05:44.940
 in the body what is the use of being moral and what is the use 

00:05:46.129 --> 00:05:48.900
 Well, that psychic and have many values 

00:05:48.900 --> 00:05:51.800
 if you do not have a body to live that 

00:05:51.800 --> 00:05:55.449
 and after that also pieces in his mind this part is moral 

00:05:56.009 --> 00:05:59.539
 of beauty and kindness that helps us to manage our
