00:01:17.680 --> 00:01:17.690 
little more successful beginning of the

00:01:17.690 --> 00:01:19.090 
little more successful beginning of the
season<00:01:17.930> it<00:01:18.230> was<00:01:18.290> a<00:01:18.380> little<00:01:18.500> rough<00:01:18.620> start

00:01:19.090 --> 00:01:19.100 
season it was a little rough start

00:01:19.100 --> 00:01:21.310

getting<00:01:19.490> getting<00:01:20.000> going<00:01:20.270> our<00:01:20.780> soul<00:01:21.080> like

00:01:21.310 --> 00:01:21.320 
getting getting going our soul like

00:01:21.320 --> 00:01:23.260 
getting getting going our soul like
found<00:01:21.770> out<00:01:21.980> was<00:01:22.130> not<00:01:22.340> exactly<00:01:22.610> perfect<00:01:23.150> for

00:01:23.260 --> 00:01:23.270 
found out was not exactly perfect for

00:01:23.270 --> 00:01:25.960 
found out was not exactly perfect for
boo<00:01:23.420> jolokia<00:01:23.960> so<00:01:24.740> I<00:01:24.770> had<00:01:24.950> to<00:01:24.980> use<00:01:25.100> potted<00:01:25.670> boo

00:01:25.960 --> 00:01:25.970 
boo jolokia so I had to use potted boo

00:01:25.970 --> 00:01:30.010 
boo jolokia so I had to use potted boo
jolokia<00:01:26.890> so<00:01:27.890> what<00:01:28.220> turned<00:01:28.760> out<00:01:28.970> happening<00:01:29.900> was

00:01:30.010 --> 00:01:30.020 
jolokia so what turned out happening was

00:01:30.020 --> 00:01:32.290 
jolokia so what turned out happening was
that<00:01:30.050> the<00:01:30.920> peppers<00:01:31.430> all<00:01:31.550> that's<00:01:31.730> smaller<00:01:32.120> than

00:01:32.290 --> 00:01:32.300 
that the peppers all that's smaller than

00:01:32.300 --> 00:01:35.080 
that the peppers all that's smaller than
the<00:01:33.080> standard<00:01:33.530> boot<00:01:33.800> jolokia<00:01:34.370> so<00:01:34.940> we're

00:01:35.080 --> 00:01:35.090 
the standard boot jolokia so we're

00:01:35.090 --> 00:01:36.910 
the standard boot jolokia so we're
hoping<00:01:35.450> that<00:01:35.690> maybe<00:01:36.410> they're<00:01:36.650> a<00:01:36.680> little<00:01:36.710> bit

00:01:36.910 --> 00:01:36.920 
hoping that maybe they're a little bit

00:01:36.920 --> 00:01:39.400 
hoping that maybe they're a little bit
hotter<00:01:37.160> and<00:01:37.670> more<00:01:38.300> packed<00:01:38.690> into<00:01:38.990> a<00:01:39.080> smaller

00:01:39.400 --> 00:01:39.410 
hotter and more packed into a smaller

00:01:39.410 --> 00:01:43.000 
hotter and more packed into a smaller
package<00:01:40.960> but<00:01:41.960> I<00:01:41.990> guess<00:01:42.470> we'll<00:01:42.620> see<00:01:42.800> tonight

00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:43.010 
package but I guess we'll see tonight

00:01:43.010 --> 00:01:46.540 
package but I guess we'll see tonight
but<00:01:43.940> it's<00:01:44.030> been<00:01:44.150> a<00:01:44.180> long<00:01:44.390> time<00:01:44.420> coming<00:01:45.550> I've

00:01:46.540 --> 00:01:46.550 
but it's been a long time coming I've

00:01:46.550 --> 00:01:49.060 
but it's been a long time coming I've
still<00:01:46.910> got<00:01:47.150> a<00:01:47.510> good<00:01:47.630> crop<00:01:48.230> going<00:01:48.800> for<00:01:48.980> this

00:01:49.060 --> 00:01:49.070 
still got a good crop going for this

00:01:49.070 --> 00:01:50.440 
still got a good crop going for this
year<00:01:49.370> and<00:01:49.520> I'm<00:01:49.580> going<00:01:49.730> to<00:01:49.760> harvest<00:01:49.910> the<00:01:50.210> seeds

potent<00:01:53.210> next<00:01:53.720> year<00:01:53.930> and<00:01:54.160> if<00:01:55.160> Billy<00:01:55.430> survives

00:01:55.870 --> 00:01:55.880 
potent next year and if Billy survives

00:01:55.880 --> 00:01:58.060
