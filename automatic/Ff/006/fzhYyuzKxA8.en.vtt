to<00:01:11.340> be<00:01:11.490> specific<00:01:12.270> I<00:01:13.010> suspect<00:01:14.010> that<00:01:14.100> after<00:01:14.640> this

00:01:14.780 --> 00:01:14.790 
to be specific I suspect that after this

00:01:14.790 --> 00:01:17.660 
to be specific I suspect that after this
war<00:01:15.090> is<00:01:15.240> over<00:01:15.440> all<00:01:16.440> ninjas<00:01:17.220> might<00:01:17.460> get<00:01:17.640> a

00:01:17.660 --> 00:01:17.670 
war is over all ninjas might get a

00:01:17.670 --> 00:01:19.280 
war is over all ninjas might get a
better<00:01:17.909> understanding<00:01:18.000> of<00:01:18.600> one<00:01:18.810> another<00:01:18.840> and

00:01:19.280 --> 00:01:19.290 
better understanding of one another and

00:01:19.290 --> 00:01:21.350 
better understanding of one another and
there<00:01:19.440> might<00:01:19.590> be<00:01:19.619> a<00:01:19.799> better<00:01:20.090> connection<00:01:21.090> of

00:01:21.350 --> 00:01:21.360 
there might be a better connection of

00:01:21.360 --> 00:01:23.660 
there might be a better connection of
peace<00:01:21.690> among<00:01:22.110> them<00:01:22.320> whereas<00:01:23.280> they<00:01:23.400> don't<00:01:23.580> have

00:01:23.660 --> 00:01:23.670 
peace among them whereas they don't have

00:01:23.670 --> 00:01:26.030 
peace among them whereas they don't have
to<00:01:23.790> fight<00:01:24.030> anymore<00:01:24.110> I'm<00:01:25.110> simply<00:01:25.500> hoping<00:01:25.680> for

to fight anymore I'm simply hoping for

00:01:26.040 --> 00:01:28.550 
to fight anymore I'm simply hoping for
something<00:01:26.280> like<00:01:26.490> that<00:01:26.549> because<00:01:27.530> they've<00:01:28.530> been

00:01:28.550 --> 00:01:28.560 
something like that because they've been

00:01:28.560 --> 00:01:31.160
