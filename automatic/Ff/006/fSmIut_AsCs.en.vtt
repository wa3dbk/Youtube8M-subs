00:00:00.190 --> 00:00:02.130
 camille 

00:00:02.130 --> 00:00:04.580
 so even 

00:00:04.580 --> 00:00:07.220
 jean-paul bougue 

00:00:07.220 --> 00:00:10.220
 tom daschle 

00:00:14.269 --> 00:00:16.989
 there we lost three job executives she did not want and 

00:00:16.989 --> 00:00:19.589
 we broke up lawyers who are 

00:00:19.589 --> 00:00:22.739
 simply crush with a fork 

00:00:22.739 --> 00:00:24.869
 so we take two lawyers 

00:00:24.869 --> 00:00:27.869
 ripening neckline the same way 

00:00:29.409 --> 00:00:30.729
 so shine 

00:00:30.729 --> 00:00:34.140
 that's because I'm pretty good when they're ripe like this 

00:00:34.870 --> 00:00:37.410
 so here I crush 

00:00:37.410 --> 00:00:38.500
 see 

00:00:38.500 --> 00:00:40.780
 the hannaford castle lawyers 

00:00:40.780 --> 00:00:44.190
 for the weight not that it is precisely for it to be pieces 

00:00:45.100 --> 00:00:46.740
 you see 

00:00:46.740 --> 00:00:48.540
 you will have sent it right after 

00:00:48.540 --> 00:00:50.320
 why because this beautiful color 

00:00:50.320 --> 00:00:52.830
 in what I'm going to cut 

00:00:52.830 --> 00:00:55.230
 a lemon 

00:00:55.230 --> 00:00:58.180
 42 for that it's a lemon and the post office 

00:00:58.180 --> 00:01:00.470
 I love lime so I prefer 

00:01:00.470 --> 00:01:03.520
 but we can do that I'm too young of st-robert find that it's more 

00:01:03.520 --> 00:01:05.050
 exotic anyway 

00:01:05.050 --> 00:01:07.220
 we're talking about subway right now 

00:01:07.220 --> 00:01:10.850
 not so simple will allow you to keep your colors right because when we talk 

00:01:10.850 --> 00:01:12.450
 too much either 

00:01:12.450 --> 00:01:14.370
 because precisely 

00:01:14.370 --> 00:01:16.710
 it must not be easy either 

00:01:16.710 --> 00:01:18.190
 I finish 2 

00:01:18.190 --> 00:01:20.620
 cut the tomatoes 

00:01:20.620 --> 00:01:23.620
 in the same 

00:01:25.550 --> 00:01:27.810
 and then I will raise new money 

00:01:27.810 --> 00:01:30.810
 so see the color is still much more severe 

00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:33.390
 see clotaire 

00:01:33.390 --> 00:01:36.440
 the real test a lot more from time to time now 

00:01:36.440 --> 00:01:39.440
 this is simple 

00:01:46.500 --> 00:01:49.830
 just a little bit more 

00:01:49.830 --> 00:01:51.970
 and so 

00:01:51.970 --> 00:01:54.970
 a pepper 

00:01:55.530 --> 00:01:57.150
 do not hesitate 

00:01:57.150 --> 00:01:59.730
 that of mexico so no problem 

00:01:59.730 --> 00:02:01.790
 it's something pretty 

00:02:01.790 --> 00:02:04.210
 it's pretty raised 

00:02:04.210 --> 00:02:08.350
 that you can eat that of course as an amuse-bouche the cessation of throws on 

00:02:08.350 --> 00:02:09.249
 sofas 

00:02:09.249 --> 00:02:11.989
 and then afterwards I wish you especially to render 

00:02:11.989 --> 00:02:13.579
 at lunch 

00:02:13.579 --> 00:02:15.329
 very very happy 

00:02:15.329 --> 00:02:17.399
 and very hot 

00:02:17.399 --> 00:02:19.319
 angelina art 

00:02:19.319 --> 00:02:21.789
 so even 

00:02:21.789 --> 00:02:24.369
 jean-paul bougue 

00:02:24.369 --> 00:02:25.179
