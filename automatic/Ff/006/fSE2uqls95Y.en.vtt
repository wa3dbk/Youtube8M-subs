gallery calm and today we're learning
how<00:00:05.990> to<00:00:06.020> draw<00:00:06.440> in<00:00:07.279> this<00:00:07.520> clip<00:00:07.819> I'm<00:00:08.030> going<00:00:08.090> to

00:00:08.260 --> 00:00:08.270 
how to draw in this clip I'm going to

00:00:08.270 --> 00:00:10.120 
how to draw in this clip I'm going to
show<00:00:08.330> you<00:00:08.510> how<00:00:08.840> to<00:00:08.900> draw<00:00:09.230> a<00:00:09.470> bird's<00:00:09.830> eye<00:00:10.100> view

00:00:10.120 --> 00:00:10.130 
show you how to draw a bird's eye view

00:00:10.130 --> 00:00:13.210 
show you how to draw a bird's eye view
and<00:00:10.850> if<00:00:11.780> your<00:00:11.960> bird's<00:00:12.200> eye<00:00:12.410> view<00:00:12.440> we<00:00:12.950> have<00:00:13.070> to

00:00:13.210 --> 00:00:13.220 
and if your bird's eye view we have to

00:00:13.220 --> 00:00:14.950 
and if your bird's eye view we have to
start<00:00:13.490> off<00:00:13.730> with<00:00:13.760> the<00:00:14.060> horizon

00:00:14.950 --> 00:00:14.960 
start off with the horizon

00:00:14.960 --> 00:00:16.510 
start off with the horizon
and<00:00:15.050> then<00:00:15.650> I'm<00:00:15.770> going<00:00:15.890> to<00:00:15.950> sort<00:00:16.190> of<00:00:16.219> pick<00:00:16.490> a

00:00:16.510 --> 00:00:16.520 
and then I'm going to sort of pick a

00:00:16.520 --> 00:00:19.690 
and then I'm going to sort of pick a
point<00:00:16.970> here<00:00:17.450> which<00:00:17.840> would<00:00:17.990> be<00:00:18.490> what<00:00:19.490> I'm<00:00:19.580> going

00:00:19.690 --> 00:00:19.700 
point here which would be what I'm going

00:00:19.700 --> 00:00:21.190 
point here which would be what I'm going
to<00:00:19.730> use<00:00:19.790> my<00:00:20.180> vanishing<00:00:20.720> point<00:00:20.960> from<00:00:21.140> my

00:00:21.190 --> 00:00:21.200 
to use my vanishing point from my

00:00:21.200 --> 00:00:24.460 
to use my vanishing point from my
perspective<00:00:22.030> now<00:00:23.030> down<00:00:23.300> here<00:00:23.330> I'm<00:00:24.140> going<00:00:24.410> to

00:00:24.460 --> 00:00:24.470 
perspective now down here I'm going to

00:00:24.470 --> 00:00:31.260 
perspective now down here I'm going to
draw<00:00:24.740> a<00:00:25.900> barn<00:00:26.900> shape<00:00:27.400> house<00:00:28.400> like<00:00:29.330> like<00:00:29.720> this

00:00:31.260 --> 00:00:31.270 
draw a barn shape house like like this

00:00:31.270 --> 00:00:33.760 
draw a barn shape house like like this
so<00:00:32.270> that<00:00:32.300> the<00:00:32.599> front<00:00:32.780> of<00:00:32.930> it<00:00:33.050> looks<00:00:33.260> like<00:00:33.470> that

00:00:33.760 --> 00:00:33.770 
so that the front of it looks like that

00:00:33.770 --> 00:00:36.069 
so that the front of it looks like that
and<00:00:34.160> now<00:00:35.000> I'm<00:00:35.150> just<00:00:35.329> going<00:00:35.450> to<00:00:35.510> carry<00:00:35.840> these

00:00:36.069 --> 00:00:36.079 
and now I'm just going to carry these

00:00:36.079 --> 00:00:43.660 
and now I'm just going to carry these
lines<00:00:36.500> through<00:00:38.739> to<00:00:39.739> the<00:00:39.829> roof<00:00:40.040> line<00:00:40.870> and<00:00:42.670> to

00:00:43.660 --> 00:00:43.670 
lines through to the roof line and to

00:00:43.670 --> 00:00:46.840 
lines through to the roof line and to
the<00:00:43.760> bottom<00:00:44.060> line<00:00:45.100> so<00:00:46.100> now<00:00:46.280> there<00:00:46.610> put<00:00:46.760> the

00:00:46.840 --> 00:00:46.850 
the bottom line so now there put the

00:00:46.850 --> 00:00:51.549 
the bottom line so now there put the
other<00:00:47.000> end<00:00:47.059> of<00:00:47.329> the<00:00:47.420> roof<00:00:47.600> in<00:00:47.870> like<00:00:48.110> this<00:00:50.559> put

00:00:51.549 --> 00:00:51.559 
other end of the roof in like this put

00:00:51.559 --> 00:00:53.650 
other end of the roof in like this put
the<00:00:51.680> bottom<00:00:52.040> end<00:00:52.250> of<00:00:52.370> the<00:00:52.520> roof<00:00:52.730> like<00:00:53.030> that<00:00:53.270> or

00:00:53.650 --> 00:00:53.660 
the bottom end of the roof like that or

00:00:53.660 --> 00:00:57.880 
the bottom end of the roof like that or
the<00:00:54.440> side<00:00:54.649> of<00:00:54.829> the<00:00:54.890> barn<00:00:55.160> like<00:00:55.399> that<00:00:56.620> we'll<00:00:57.620> put

00:00:57.880 --> 00:00:57.890 
the side of the barn like that we'll put

00:00:57.890 --> 00:01:01.540 
the side of the barn like that we'll put
a<00:00:58.690> loft<00:00:59.690> opening<00:01:00.469> at<00:01:00.590> the<00:01:00.649> top<00:01:00.739> of<00:01:01.100> this<00:01:01.219> barn

00:01:01.540 --> 00:01:01.550 
a loft opening at the top of this barn

00:01:01.550 --> 00:01:04.539 
a loft opening at the top of this barn
and<00:01:01.850> maybe<00:01:02.450> down<00:01:02.690> here<00:01:02.750> a<00:01:03.320> nice<00:01:03.620> long<00:01:04.009> barn

00:01:04.539 --> 00:01:04.549 
and maybe down here a nice long barn

00:01:04.549 --> 00:01:08.020 
and maybe down here a nice long barn
door<00:01:05.030> and<00:01:05.509> you<00:01:06.350> know<00:01:06.469> that<00:01:06.709> the<00:01:06.950> real<00:01:07.490> Q<00:01:07.789> here

00:01:08.020 --> 00:01:08.030 
door and you know that the real Q here

00:01:08.030 --> 00:01:09.819 
door and you know that the real Q here
is<00:01:08.119> the<00:01:08.240> horizon<00:01:08.479> line<00:01:08.869> being<00:01:09.109> up<00:01:09.350> here<00:01:09.649> and<00:01:09.770> a

00:01:09.819 --> 00:01:09.829 
is the horizon line being up here and a

00:01:09.829 --> 00:01:12.370 
is the horizon line being up here and a
vanishing<00:01:10.280> point<00:01:10.310> for<00:01:10.729> these<00:01:10.850> roof<00:01:11.299> gives<00:01:12.259> you

00:01:12.370 --> 00:01:12.380 
vanishing point for these roof gives you

00:01:12.380 --> 00:01:14.230 
vanishing point for these roof gives you
a<00:01:12.469> view<00:01:12.740> that<00:01:12.979> you're<00:01:13.130> looking<00:01:13.399> down<00:01:13.729> at<00:01:14.090> the

00:01:14.230 --> 00:01:14.240 
a view that you're looking down at the

00:01:14.240 --> 00:01:18.669 
a view that you're looking down at the
top<00:01:14.450> of<00:01:14.630> the<00:01:14.749> house<00:01:17.229> suggest<00:01:18.229> some<00:01:18.380> shingles

00:01:18.669 --> 00:01:18.679 
top of the house suggest some shingles

00:01:18.679 --> 00:01:22.149 
top of the house suggest some shingles
in<00:01:19.009> here<00:01:19.659> here<00:01:20.659> we'd<00:01:20.810> have<00:01:20.990> this<00:01:21.200> barn<00:01:21.590> door<00:01:21.950> I

00:01:22.149 --> 00:01:22.159 
in here here we'd have this barn door I

00:01:22.159 --> 00:01:25.029 
in here here we'd have this barn door I
mean<00:01:22.399> the<00:01:22.579> hatch<00:01:23.119> door<00:01:23.450> like<00:01:23.689> that<00:01:23.929> put<00:01:24.920> the

00:01:25.029 --> 00:01:25.039 
mean the hatch door like that put the

00:01:25.039 --> 00:01:27.669 
mean the hatch door like that put the
barn<00:01:25.279> door<00:01:25.520> like<00:01:25.700> that<00:01:26.049> we<00:01:27.049> can<00:01:27.229> even<00:01:27.380> have

00:01:27.669 --> 00:01:27.679 
barn door like that we can even have

00:01:27.679 --> 00:01:31.139 
barn door like that we can even have
some<00:01:27.709> semblances<00:01:28.490> of<00:01:28.639> trees<00:01:28.969> out<00:01:29.359> here<00:01:29.560> and

00:01:31.139 --> 00:01:31.149 
some semblances of trees out here and

00:01:31.149 --> 00:01:33.639 
some semblances of trees out here and
again<00:01:32.149> we'd<00:01:32.389> be<00:01:32.509> looking<00:01:32.689> down<00:01:33.109> from<00:01:33.469> the<00:01:33.560> top

00:01:33.639 --> 00:01:33.649 
again we'd be looking down from the top

00:01:33.649 --> 00:01:35.529 
again we'd be looking down from the top
down<00:01:34.219> and<00:01:34.490> this<00:01:34.549> is<00:01:34.729> the<00:01:34.849> way<00:01:34.939> we<00:01:35.149> generally

00:01:35.529 --> 00:01:35.539 
down and this is the way we generally

00:01:35.539 --> 00:01:39.190 
down and this is the way we generally
show<00:01:35.810> that<00:01:36.399> his<00:01:37.399> little<00:01:37.999> triangular<00:01:38.899> shapes

00:01:39.190 --> 00:01:39.200 
show that his little triangular shapes

00:01:39.200 --> 00:01:43.510 
show that his little triangular shapes
like<00:01:39.469> these<00:01:39.740> were<00:01:41.139> fir<00:01:42.139> trees<00:01:42.560> we'd<00:01:43.399> be

00:01:43.510 --> 00:01:43.520 
like these were fir trees we'd be

00:01:43.520 --> 00:01:44.820 
like these were fir trees we'd be
looking<00:01:43.700> at<00:01:43.999> it<00:01:44.179> like<00:01:44.209> that

00:01:44.820 --> 00:01:44.830 
looking at it like that

00:01:44.830 --> 00:01:47.130 
looking at it like that
we're<00:01:45.010> looking<00:01:45.250> down<00:01:45.430> on<00:01:45.670> it<00:01:45.700> if<00:01:46.660> we<00:01:46.840> want<00:01:47.050> to

00:01:47.130 --> 00:01:47.140 
we're looking down on it if we want to

00:01:47.140 --> 00:01:48.990 
we're looking down on it if we want to
show<00:01:47.350> what<00:01:47.620> a<00:01:47.650> bird<00:01:47.920> would<00:01:48.190> look<00:01:48.400> like<00:01:48.580> in<00:01:48.790> here

00:01:48.990 --> 00:01:49.000 
show what a bird would look like in here

00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:51.980 
show what a bird would look like in here
-<00:01:49.270> we<00:01:49.660> can<00:01:49.840> just<00:01:50.050> put<00:01:50.350> the<00:01:50.470> bird<00:01:50.710> right<00:01:51.040> up<00:01:51.190> here

00:01:51.980 --> 00:01:51.990 
- we can just put the bird right up here

00:01:51.990 --> 00:01:55.260 
- we can just put the bird right up here
and<00:01:52.990> have<00:01:53.200> his<00:01:53.380> back<00:01:53.620> up<00:01:53.920> here<00:01:54.280> put<00:01:54.880> his<00:01:55.000> wings

00:01:55.260 --> 00:01:55.270 
and have his back up here put his wings

00:01:55.270 --> 00:01:58.230 
and have his back up here put his wings
back<00:01:55.600> in<00:01:55.870> here<00:01:56.140> like<00:01:56.290> this<00:01:56.560> and<00:01:56.970> his<00:01:57.970> tail

00:01:58.230 --> 00:01:58.240 
back in here like this and his tail

00:01:58.240 --> 00:02:01.800 
back in here like this and his tail
feathers<00:01:58.690> out<00:01:58.840> here<00:01:59.140> like<00:01:59.350> that<00:01:59.380> and<00:02:00.810> I'll

00:02:01.800 --> 00:02:01.810 
feathers out here like that and I'll

00:02:01.810 --> 00:02:06.080 
feathers out here like that and I'll
just<00:02:01.990> put<00:02:02.230> his<00:02:02.440> little<00:02:03.370> feet<00:02:04.180> like<00:02:04.450> this<00:02:04.720> and

00:02:06.080 --> 00:02:06.090 
just put his little feet like this and

00:02:06.090 --> 00:02:11.220 
just put his little feet like this and
have<00:02:07.090> him<00:02:07.330> on<00:02:07.480> a<00:02:07.510> branch<00:02:09.630> where<00:02:10.630> he's<00:02:10.840> above

00:02:11.220 --> 00:02:11.230 
have him on a branch where he's above

00:02:11.230 --> 00:02:13.920

and<00:02:11.620> you<00:02:12.280> can<00:02:12.430> actually<00:02:12.640> see<00:02:13.150> him<00:02:13.300> on<00:02:13.540> that

00:02:13.920 --> 00:02:13.930 
and you can actually see him on that

00:02:13.930 --> 00:02:16.650 
and you can actually see him on that
bird's-eye<00:02:14.560> view<00:02:15.300> where<00:02:16.300> he<00:02:16.480> would<00:02:16.630> be

00:02:16.650 --> 00:02:16.660 
bird's-eye view where he would be

00:02:16.660 --> 00:02:23.100 
bird's-eye view where he would be
looking<00:02:17.080> down<00:02:18.720> at<00:02:20.220> the<00:02:21.220> landscape<00:02:21.790> again<00:02:22.660> he's

00:02:23.100 --> 00:02:23.110 
looking down at the landscape again he's

00:02:23.110 --> 00:02:25.890 
looking down at the landscape again he's
up<00:02:23.290> higher<00:02:23.620> so<00:02:24.040> the<00:02:24.160> landscape<00:02:24.730> is<00:02:25.480> showing

00:02:25.890 --> 00:02:25.900 
up higher so the landscape is showing

00:02:25.900 --> 00:02:32.970 
up higher so the landscape is showing
the<00:02:26.020> horizon<00:02:26.560> line<00:02:26.770> up<00:02:27.400> nice<00:02:27.790> and<00:02:27.820> high<00:02:28.180> so<00:02:31.980> we

00:02:32.970 --> 00:02:32.980 
the horizon line up nice and high so we

00:02:32.980 --> 00:02:34.890 
the horizon line up nice and high so we
have<00:02:33.130> our<00:02:33.280> bird<00:02:33.550> we<00:02:33.940> have<00:02:33.970> a<00:02:34.090> barn<00:02:34.480> where<00:02:34.810> we're

00:02:34.890 --> 00:02:34.900 
have our bird we have a barn where we're

00:02:34.900 --> 00:02:36.330 
have our bird we have a barn where we're
looking<00:02:35.020> down<00:02:35.410> at<00:02:35.560> the<00:02:35.650> roof<00:02:35.830> we're<00:02:36.100> looking

00:02:36.330 --> 00:02:36.340 
looking down at the roof we're looking

00:02:36.340 --> 00:02:38.370 
looking down at the roof we're looking
down<00:02:36.550> at<00:02:36.700> the<00:02:36.790> tops<00:02:37.030> of<00:02:37.180> the<00:02:37.270> trees<00:02:37.420> and<00:02:38.170> we

00:02:38.370 --> 00:02:38.380 
down at the tops of the trees and we

00:02:38.380 --> 00:02:39.960 
down at the tops of the trees and we
might<00:02:38.590> even<00:02:38.620> just<00:02:39.010> put<00:02:39.280> in<00:02:39.400> a<00:02:39.490> little<00:02:39.700> curved

00:02:39.960 --> 00:02:39.970 
might even just put in a little curved

00:02:39.970 --> 00:02:44.070 
might even just put in a little curved
path<00:02:40.450> for<00:02:40.750> the<00:02:40.840> barn<00:02:41.370> and<00:02:42.480> maybe<00:02:43.480> even<00:02:43.780> a<00:02:43.840> side

00:02:44.070 --> 00:02:44.080 
path for the barn and maybe even a side

00:02:44.080 --> 00:02:48.510 
path for the barn and maybe even a side
path<00:02:44.410> and<00:02:44.770> a<00:02:45.550> little<00:02:45.850> suggestion<00:02:46.330> of<00:02:47.520> texture

00:02:48.510 --> 00:02:48.520 
path and a little suggestion of texture

00:02:48.520 --> 00:02:51.509 
path and a little suggestion of texture
for<00:02:49.000> where<00:02:49.180> the<00:02:49.300> grass<00:02:49.540> might<00:02:49.870> be<00:02:50.340> this<00:02:51.340> has

00:02:51.509 --> 00:02:51.519 
for where the grass might be this has

00:02:51.519 --> 00:02:53.280 
for where the grass might be this has
been<00:02:51.700> Ralph<00:02:51.940> papa<00:02:52.239> and<00:02:52.660> thank<00:02:53.019> you<00:02:53.140> for
