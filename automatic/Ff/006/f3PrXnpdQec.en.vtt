00:04:59.639 --> 00:05:02.690
 example I know 

00:05:03.500 --> 00:05:10.310

 and here we put in 3 where it puts 3 

00:05:21.699 --> 00:05:26.510
 we put the light 

00:05:24.320 --> 00:05:29.470
 I in this case I will not put any 

00:05:26.510 --> 00:05:31.900
 you are looking for it on the internet the ips 

00:05:29.470 --> 00:05:34.720
 and the port 

00:05:31.900 --> 00:05:37.030
 either it usually changes or sometimes it does not 

00:05:34.720 --> 00:05:39.130
 I do not know depends on the server so 

00:05:37.030 --> 00:05:40.990
 you will see because there are a lot 

00:05:39.130 --> 00:05:42.970
 of servers the truth what happens is 

00:05:40.990 --> 00:05:44.990
 that sometimes gets in and other times 

00:05:42.970 --> 00:05:47.630
 they do not get 

00:05:44.990 --> 00:05:49.940
 then you will come out here just one 

00:05:47.630 --> 00:05:54.830
 kill on the play or will come out here 

00:05:49.940 --> 00:05:57.080
