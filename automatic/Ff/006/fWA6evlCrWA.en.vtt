it<00:02:14.560> really<00:02:14.740> set<00:02:15.040> it<00:02:15.130> up

00:02:21.970 --> 00:02:21.980 

00:02:21.980 --> 00:02:33.670 

we're<00:02:22.980> at<00:02:23.070> times<00:02:23.370> of<00:02:23.580> low<00:02:24.090> end

00:02:33.670 --> 00:02:33.680 

00:02:33.680 --> 00:02:37.839 

we<00:02:33.890> don't<00:02:34.040> burst<00:02:34.250> until<00:02:34.400> a<00:02:34.579> half<00:02:34.819> and<00:02:36.670> it's<00:02:37.670> not

00:02:37.839 --> 00:02:37.849 
we don't burst until a half and it's not

00:02:37.849 --> 00:02:40.630 
we don't burst until a half and it's not
to<00:02:38.120> over<00:02:38.689> gating<00:02:39.140> and<00:02:39.709> you<00:02:39.980> still<00:02:40.250> hear<00:02:40.459> them

to over gating and you still hear them

00:02:40.640 --> 00:02:43.899 
to over gating and you still hear them
technically<00:02:41.060> the<00:02:41.299> string<00:02:41.709> really<00:02:42.909> heavy-duty

00:02:43.899 --> 00:02:43.909 
technically the string really heavy-duty

00:02:43.909 --> 00:02:46.630 
technically the string really heavy-duty
transformer<00:02:44.719> in<00:02:44.840> it<00:02:45.069> this<00:02:46.069> thing<00:02:46.280> is<00:02:46.310> really

00:02:46.630 --> 00:02:46.640 
transformer in it this thing is really

00:02:46.640 --> 00:02:48.819 
transformer in it this thing is really
loud<00:02:46.939> it's<00:02:47.480> barely<00:02:47.750> on<00:02:47.989> right<00:02:48.319> now<00:02:48.469> it's<00:02:48.620> 80

00:02:48.819 --> 00:02:48.829 
loud it's barely on right now it's 80

00:02:48.829 --> 00:03:09.890 
loud it's barely on right now it's 80
watts<00:02:49.129> and<00:02:49.459> that's<00:02:50.120> all<00:02:50.239> you

00:03:09.890 --> 00:03:09.900 

00:03:09.900 --> 00:03:13.960 

it's<00:03:10.800> got<00:03:10.980> a<00:03:11.010> really<00:03:11.310> good<00:03:11.780> chunk<00:03:12.780> in<00:03:12.930> there

00:03:13.960 --> 00:03:13.970 
it's got a really good chunk in there

00:03:13.970 --> 00:03:22.720 
it's got a really good chunk in there
everybody<00:03:14.570> had

00:03:22.720 --> 00:03:22.730 

00:03:22.730 --> 00:03:25.869 

so<00:03:23.330> what<00:03:23.510> I<00:03:23.540> do<00:03:23.660> is<00:03:24.050> I<00:03:24.319> I<00:03:24.620> use<00:03:24.920> four<00:03:25.580> points

00:03:25.869 --> 00:03:25.879 
so what I do is I I use four points

00:03:25.879 --> 00:03:28.150 
so what I do is I I use four points
right<00:03:26.060> I<00:03:26.180> use<00:03:26.360> this<00:03:26.540> G<00:03:27.170> major<00:03:27.410> or<00:03:27.739> a<00:03:27.769> key<00:03:28.010> major

00:03:28.150 --> 00:03:28.160 
right I use this G major or a key major

00:03:28.160 --> 00:03:32.920 
right I use this G major or a key major
to<00:03:28.840> what<00:03:29.840> I<00:03:29.870> do<00:03:29.989> is<00:03:30.349> I<00:03:30.610> plug<00:03:31.610> that<00:03:31.790> into<00:03:32.660> the

00:03:32.920 --> 00:03:32.930 
to what I do is I plug that into the

00:03:32.930 --> 00:03:34.550 
to what I do is I plug that into the
effects<00:03:33.560> loop

00:03:34.550 --> 00:03:34.560 
effects loop

00:03:34.560 --> 00:03:36.100 
effects loop
of<00:03:34.680> the<00:03:34.830> app

00:03:36.100 --> 00:03:36.110 
of the app

00:03:36.110 --> 00:03:39.700 
of the app
and<00:03:36.440> you<00:03:36.560> have<00:03:36.710> a<00:03:37.330> ascend<00:03:38.330> control<00:03:38.720> and<00:03:39.290> return

00:03:39.700 --> 00:03:39.710 
and you have a ascend control and return

00:03:39.710 --> 00:03:41.350 
and you have a ascend control and return
control<00:03:40.130> on<00:03:40.310> the<00:03:40.430> back<00:03:40.610> of<00:03:40.760> the<00:03:40.820> amp<00:03:41.000> which<00:03:41.210> is

00:03:41.350 --> 00:03:41.360 
control on the back of the amp which is

00:03:41.360 --> 00:03:44.350 
control on the back of the amp which is
really<00:03:41.570> cool<00:03:42.190> you<00:03:43.190> just<00:03:43.250> crank<00:03:43.670> the<00:03:43.850> input<00:03:44.180> all

00:03:44.350 --> 00:03:44.360 
really cool you just crank the input all

00:03:44.360 --> 00:03:50.850 
really cool you just crank the input all
the<00:03:44.480> way<00:03:44.630> for

00:03:50.850 --> 00:03:50.860 

00:03:50.860 --> 00:03:54.240 

and<00:03:51.040> then<00:03:51.430> I<00:03:51.790> control<00:03:52.420> it<00:03:52.800> with<00:03:53.800> the<00:03:53.920> g-major

00:03:54.240 --> 00:03:54.250 
and then I control it with the g-major

00:03:54.250 --> 00:03:58.110 
and then I control it with the g-major
there's<00:03:54.640> a<00:03:54.810> switch<00:03:55.810> on<00:03:56.230> the<00:03:56.290> back<00:03:56.440> of<00:03:56.800> it<00:03:57.120> that

00:03:58.110 --> 00:03:58.120 
there's a switch on the back of it that

00:03:58.120 --> 00:04:01.590 
there's a switch on the back of it that
you<00:03:58.270> can<00:03:58.440> MIDI<00:03:59.440> control<00:04:00.040> you<00:04:00.910> can<00:04:01.060> switch<00:04:01.360> the

00:04:01.590 --> 00:04:01.600 
you can MIDI control you can switch the

00:04:01.600 --> 00:04:04.350 
you can MIDI control you can switch the
channels<00:04:02.080> on<00:04:02.350> the<00:04:02.770> crank<00:04:03.310> so<00:04:03.730> you<00:04:03.820> can<00:04:03.970> go<00:04:04.090> from

00:04:04.350 --> 00:04:04.360 
channels on the crank so you can go from

00:04:04.360 --> 00:04:06.270 
channels on the crank so you can go from
the<00:04:04.690> heavy<00:04:04.870> channel<00:04:05.320> to<00:04:05.500> the<00:04:05.590> clean<00:04:05.800> channel

00:04:06.270 --> 00:04:06.280 
the heavy channel to the clean channel

00:04:06.280 --> 00:04:09.059 
the heavy channel to the clean channel
using<00:04:06.640> a<00:04:06.730> MIDI<00:04:06.940> mouse

00:04:09.059 --> 00:04:09.069 
using a MIDI mouse

00:04:09.069 --> 00:04:10.770 
using a MIDI mouse
just<00:04:09.459> because<00:04:09.640> I<00:04:09.730> couldn't<00:04:10.150> bring<00:04:10.359> my<00:04:10.540> big

00:04:10.770 --> 00:04:10.780 
just because I couldn't bring my big

00:04:10.780 --> 00:04:19.990 
just because I couldn't bring my big
trap<00:04:11.170> thing<00:04:11.499> down<00:04:11.829> here<00:04:12.040> so

00:04:19.990 --> 00:04:20.000 

00:04:20.000 --> 00:04:23.210 

it's<00:04:20.420> fast

00:04:23.210 --> 00:04:23.220 

00:04:23.220 --> 00:04:25.130 

and<00:04:23.400> then<00:04:23.880> effect<00:04:24.300> that<00:04:24.420> the<00:04:24.510> effects<00:04:24.810> loop<00:04:24.990> of

00:04:25.130 --> 00:04:25.140 
and then effect that the effects loop of

00:04:25.140 --> 00:04:26.870 
and then effect that the effects loop of
the<00:04:25.260> amp<00:04:25.440> you're<00:04:25.830> getting<00:04:26.070> all<00:04:26.220> the<00:04:26.400> coal

00:04:26.870 --> 00:04:26.880 
the amp you're getting all the coal

00:04:26.880 --> 00:04:31.300 
the amp you're getting all the coal
whatever<00:04:27.540> RAC<00:04:27.780> dare<00:04:28.050> you<00:04:28.170> want<00:04:28.850> and

00:04:31.300 --> 00:04:31.310 
whatever RAC dare you want and

00:04:31.310 --> 00:04:33.430 
whatever RAC dare you want and
I<00:04:31.400> just<00:04:31.910> use<00:04:32.120> the<00:04:32.210> TC<00:04:32.510> electrons<00:04:32.930> because<00:04:33.320> it

00:04:33.430 --> 00:04:33.440 
I just use the TC electrons because it

00:04:33.440 --> 00:04:48.850 
I just use the TC electrons because it
switches<00:04:33.710> channels

00:04:48.850 --> 00:04:48.860 

00:04:48.860 --> 00:04:52.390 

any<00:04:49.100> changes<00:04:49.910> on<00:04:50.030> the<00:04:50.120> g-major<00:04:51.040> got<00:04:52.040> your<00:04:52.190> rig

00:04:52.390 --> 00:04:52.400 
any changes on the g-major got your rig

00:04:52.400 --> 00:04:55.060 
any changes on the g-major got your rig
there<00:04:52.640> it's<00:04:53.260> it's<00:04:54.260> really<00:04:54.530> easy<00:04:54.680> you<00:04:54.800> get<00:04:55.040> a
