00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.480 

I<00:00:00.020> have<00:00:01.020> always<00:00:01.350> been<00:00:01.709> wondering<00:00:02.190> whether

00:00:02.480 --> 00:00:02.490 
I have always been wondering whether

00:00:02.490 --> 00:00:04.630 
I have always been wondering whether
there<00:00:02.790> is<00:00:02.879> any<00:00:03.179> difference<00:00:03.600> between<00:00:03.689> using

00:00:04.630 --> 00:00:04.640 
there is any difference between using

00:00:04.640 --> 00:00:09.379 
there is any difference between using
different<00:00:05.640> cables<00:00:06.799> well<00:00:07.799> I<00:00:08.250> was<00:00:08.730> wondering<00:00:09.120> -

00:00:09.379 --> 00:00:09.389 
different cables well I was wondering -

00:00:09.389 --> 00:00:12.230 
different cables well I was wondering -
so<00:00:10.099> today<00:00:11.099> I'm<00:00:11.309> going<00:00:11.460> to<00:00:11.519> try<00:00:11.670> to<00:00:11.759> find<00:00:12.030> out

00:00:12.230 --> 00:00:12.240 
so today I'm going to try to find out

00:00:12.240 --> 00:00:14.690 
so today I'm going to try to find out
whether<00:00:12.570> there's<00:00:12.750> any<00:00:12.929> difference<00:00:13.349> using<00:00:13.700> sat

00:00:14.690 --> 00:00:14.700 
whether there's any difference using sat

00:00:14.700 --> 00:00:17.590 
whether there's any difference using sat
alone<00:00:14.880> saw<00:00:15.360> the<00:00:15.389> two<00:00:15.690> or<00:00:15.900> saw<00:00:16.109> the<00:00:16.170> free<00:00:16.470> cable

00:00:17.590 --> 00:00:17.600 
alone saw the two or saw the free cable

00:00:17.600 --> 00:00:22.580 
alone saw the two or saw the free cable
so<00:00:18.650> I'll<00:00:19.650> be<00:00:19.770> doing<00:00:19.890> this<00:00:20.100> on<00:00:20.400> odor<00:00:20.880> a<00:00:21.380> bit<00:00:22.380> and

00:00:22.580 --> 00:00:22.590 
so I'll be doing this on odor a bit and

00:00:22.590 --> 00:00:26.179 
so I'll be doing this on odor a bit and
force<00:00:23.150> K<00:00:24.150> +<00:00:24.330> 9<00:00:24.570> s<00:00:24.869> motherboard<00:00:25.470> using<00:00:26.010> a

00:00:26.179 --> 00:00:26.189 
force K + 9 s motherboard using a

00:00:26.189 --> 00:00:32.740 
force K + 9 s motherboard using a
crucial<00:00:26.849> m4<00:00:27.660> 64<00:00:28.410> gigabyte<00:00:28.890> SSD<00:00:29.480> drive<00:00:31.040> so<00:00:32.040> and

00:00:32.740 --> 00:00:32.750 
crucial m4 64 gigabyte SSD drive so and

00:00:32.750 --> 00:00:35.240 
crucial m4 64 gigabyte SSD drive so and
this<00:00:33.750> motherboard<00:00:34.020> producers<00:00:34.620> claims<00:00:34.950> that

00:00:35.240 --> 00:00:35.250 
this motherboard producers claims that

00:00:35.250 --> 00:00:39.049 
this motherboard producers claims that
these<00:00:35.790> four<00:00:36.120> ports<00:00:36.630> you<00:00:37.559> can<00:00:37.739> see<00:00:37.920> here<00:00:38.280> can

00:00:39.049 --> 00:00:39.059 
these four ports you can see here can

00:00:39.059 --> 00:00:42.850 
these four ports you can see here can
support<00:00:39.510> up<00:00:40.410> to<00:00:40.469> three<00:00:40.770> gigabits<00:00:41.219> per<00:00:41.340> second

00:00:42.850 --> 00:00:42.860 
support up to three gigabits per second

00:00:42.860 --> 00:00:48.950 
support up to three gigabits per second
so<00:00:43.860> technically<00:00:46.250> the<00:00:47.300> cable<00:00:48.300> could<00:00:48.570> possibly

00:00:48.950 --> 00:00:48.960 
so technically the cable could possibly

00:00:48.960 --> 00:00:50.330 
so technically the cable could possibly
make<00:00:49.170> some<00:00:49.410> difference<00:00:49.770> because<00:00:49.980> I'm<00:00:50.100> poor<00:00:50.309> I

00:00:50.330 --> 00:00:50.340 
make some difference because I'm poor I

00:00:50.340 --> 00:00:54.049 
make some difference because I'm poor I
think<00:00:50.670> if<00:00:51.469> you're<00:00:52.469> using<00:00:52.620> the<00:00:53.250> soft<00:00:53.489> one<00:00:53.760> cable

00:00:54.049 --> 00:00:54.059 
think if you're using the soft one cable

00:00:54.059 --> 00:00:56.150 
think if you're using the soft one cable
it<00:00:54.329> may<00:00:54.480> not<00:00:54.629> produce<00:00:54.809> the<00:00:55.110> same<00:00:55.140> results<00:00:55.829> saw

00:00:56.150 --> 00:00:56.160 
it may not produce the same results saw

00:00:56.160 --> 00:00:58.729 
it may not produce the same results saw
to<00:00:56.489> cable<00:00:56.940> as<00:00:57.570> far<00:00:57.840> as<00:00:57.960> I<00:00:58.050> heard<00:00:58.379> there's<00:00:58.620> no

00:00:58.729 --> 00:00:58.739 
to cable as far as I heard there's no

00:00:58.739 --> 00:01:02.450 
to cable as far as I heard there's no
difference<00:00:59.250> at<00:01:00.090> all<00:01:00.359> between<00:01:00.629> cables<00:01:01.620> so

00:01:02.450 --> 00:01:02.460 
difference at all between cables so

00:01:02.460 --> 00:01:04.130 
difference at all between cables so
technically<00:01:03.180> there<00:01:03.629> shouldn't<00:01:03.840> be<00:01:03.930> any

00:01:04.130 --> 00:01:04.140 
technically there shouldn't be any

00:01:04.140 --> 00:01:05.590 
technically there shouldn't be any
difference<00:01:04.470> between<00:01:04.619> all<00:01:04.949> three<00:01:04.979> of<00:01:05.339> them

00:01:05.590 --> 00:01:05.600 
difference between all three of them

00:01:05.600 --> 00:01:10.130 
difference between all three of them
anyway<00:01:06.600> I'm<00:01:06.869> be<00:01:07.260> using<00:01:07.619> the<00:01:07.710> a<00:01:07.740> SSD<00:01:09.140> benchmark

00:01:10.130 --> 00:01:10.140 
anyway I'm be using the a SSD benchmark

00:01:10.140 --> 00:01:13.880 
anyway I'm be using the a SSD benchmark
so<00:01:10.820> let's<00:01:11.820> see<00:01:12.030> what<00:01:12.180> we<00:01:12.299> can<00:01:12.450> do<00:01:12.630> okay<00:01:13.409> as<00:01:13.770> I

00:01:13.880 --> 00:01:13.890 
so let's see what we can do okay as I

00:01:13.890 --> 00:01:16.280 
so let's see what we can do okay as I
said<00:01:14.130> we<00:01:14.250> will<00:01:14.310> be<00:01:14.369> using<00:01:14.790> a<00:01:14.880> SSD<00:01:15.659> benchmark

00:01:16.280 --> 00:01:16.290 
said we will be using a SSD benchmark

00:01:16.290 --> 00:01:19.130 
said we will be using a SSD benchmark
test<00:01:17.220> different<00:01:17.460> sound<00:01:18.210> cables<00:01:18.659> on<00:01:18.840> the<00:01:18.869> same

00:01:19.130 --> 00:01:19.140 
test different sound cables on the same

00:01:19.140 --> 00:01:21.710 
test different sound cables on the same
hard<00:01:19.409> drive<00:01:19.500> so<00:01:20.210> to<00:01:21.210> make<00:01:21.360> it<00:01:21.450> more<00:01:21.570> accurate

00:01:21.710 --> 00:01:21.720 
hard drive so to make it more accurate

00:01:21.720 --> 00:01:25.010 
hard drive so to make it more accurate
I'll<00:01:22.259> do<00:01:22.439> the<00:01:22.619> free<00:01:22.950> tests<00:01:23.610> on<00:01:23.970> the<00:01:24.450> same<00:01:24.720> cable

00:01:25.010 --> 00:01:25.020 
I'll do the free tests on the same cable

00:01:25.020 --> 00:01:28.429 
I'll do the free tests on the same cable
so<00:01:25.950> to<00:01:26.009> ensure<00:01:26.670> more<00:01:27.390> accurate<00:01:27.780> results<00:01:28.259> I

00:01:28.429 --> 00:01:28.439 
so to ensure more accurate results I

00:01:28.439 --> 00:01:30.620 
so to ensure more accurate results I
produce<00:01:29.250> and<00:01:29.759> I'm<00:01:29.850> going<00:01:30.030> to<00:01:30.060> choose<00:01:30.299> the<00:01:30.450> best

00:01:30.620 --> 00:01:30.630 
produce and I'm going to choose the best

00:01:30.630 --> 00:01:32.690 
produce and I'm going to choose the best
one<00:01:30.930> and<00:01:31.170> I'm<00:01:31.710> going<00:01:31.829> to<00:01:31.860> show<00:01:32.040> you<00:01:32.070> entire

00:01:32.690 --> 00:01:32.700 
one and I'm going to show you entire

00:01:32.700 --> 00:01:35.120 
one and I'm going to show you entire
testing<00:01:33.479> process<00:01:33.960> the<00:01:34.229> subway<00:01:34.560> system<00:01:34.619> take

00:01:35.120 --> 00:01:35.130 
testing process the subway system take

00:01:35.130 --> 00:01:37.310 
testing process the subway system take
ages<00:01:35.549> but<00:01:35.700> let's<00:01:35.909> just<00:01:36.090> have<00:01:36.270> a<00:01:36.329> look<00:01:36.479> at<00:01:37.140> the

00:01:37.310 --> 00:01:37.320 
ages but let's just have a look at the

00:01:37.320 --> 00:01:41.200 
ages but let's just have a look at the
first<00:01:37.560> attempt<00:01:37.920> using<00:01:38.220> the<00:01:38.460> santa<00:01:38.970> one<00:01:39.869> cable

00:01:41.200 --> 00:01:41.210 
first attempt using the santa one cable

00:01:41.210 --> 00:01:44.740 
first attempt using the santa one cable
so<00:01:42.210> here<00:01:42.509> we<00:01:42.630> go

00:01:44.740 --> 00:01:44.750 
so here we go

00:01:44.750 --> 00:01:48.350 
so here we go
so<00:01:45.750> the<00:01:45.930> right<00:01:46.140> speed<00:01:46.500> is<00:01:46.850> just<00:01:47.850> the<00:01:47.970> way<00:01:48.119> it's

00:01:48.350 --> 00:01:48.360 
so the right speed is just the way it's

00:01:48.360 --> 00:01:52.399 
so the right speed is just the way it's
supposed<00:01:49.140> to<00:01:49.259> be<00:01:49.409> on<00:01:49.680> 64m<00:01:50.610> for<00:01:50.939> crucial<00:01:51.780> SSD

00:01:52.399 --> 00:01:52.409 
supposed to be on 64m for crucial SSD

00:01:52.409 --> 00:01:54.440 
supposed to be on 64m for crucial SSD
drive<00:01:52.680> one<00:01:52.979> hundred<00:01:53.250> six<00:01:53.520> hundred<00:01:53.790> seven

00:01:54.440 --> 00:01:54.450 
drive one hundred six hundred seven

00:01:54.450 --> 00:01:59.330 
drive one hundred six hundred seven
bytes<00:01:55.049> per<00:01:55.290> second

00:01:59.330 --> 00:01:59.340 

00:01:59.340 --> 00:02:04.520 

and<00:02:01.130> read<00:02:02.130> speed<00:02:02.570> 232<00:02:03.570> megabytes<00:02:03.990> per<00:02:04.049> second

00:02:04.520 --> 00:02:04.530 
and read speed 232 megabytes per second

00:02:04.530 --> 00:02:07.490 
and read speed 232 megabytes per second
so<00:02:05.159> I'll<00:02:05.399> do<00:02:05.640> the<00:02:05.850> free<00:02:06.060> more<00:02:06.390> tests<00:02:06.899> on<00:02:07.110> sat.1

00:02:07.490 --> 00:02:07.500 
so I'll do the free more tests on sat.1

00:02:07.500 --> 00:02:09.859 
so I'll do the free more tests on sat.1
and<00:02:07.710> then<00:02:08.310> we'll<00:02:08.550> see<00:02:08.789> what<00:02:09.030> results<00:02:09.569> we<00:02:09.630> get

00:02:09.859 --> 00:02:09.869 
and then we'll see what results we get

00:02:09.869 --> 00:02:13.750 
and then we'll see what results we get
so<00:02:10.830> the<00:02:11.069> highest<00:02:11.250> possible<00:02:11.849> score<00:02:11.970> on<00:02:12.360> sat.1<00:02:12.690> i

00:02:13.750 --> 00:02:13.760 
so the highest possible score on sat.1 i

00:02:13.760 --> 00:02:18.380 
so the highest possible score on sat.1 i
was<00:02:14.760> able<00:02:15.000> to<00:02:15.090> get<00:02:15.380> 344<00:02:16.380> and<00:02:16.709> 236<00:02:17.670> megabytes

00:02:18.380 --> 00:02:18.390 
was able to get 344 and 236 megabytes

00:02:18.390 --> 00:02:20.900 
was able to get 344 and 236 megabytes
per<00:02:18.540> second<00:02:19.200> but<00:02:19.319> squirrelly<00:02:20.310> doesn't<00:02:20.640> say

00:02:20.900 --> 00:02:20.910 
per second but squirrelly doesn't say

00:02:20.910 --> 00:02:22.759 
per second but squirrelly doesn't say
much<00:02:21.150> because<00:02:21.660> if<00:02:21.780> you<00:02:21.810> go<00:02:22.019> to<00:02:22.080> other<00:02:22.349> results

00:02:22.759 --> 00:02:22.769 
much because if you go to other results

00:02:22.769 --> 00:02:26.150 
much because if you go to other results
for<00:02:23.310> example<00:02:23.819> in<00:02:23.970> this<00:02:24.060> case<00:02:24.330> I<00:02:24.599> got<00:02:24.750> 344<00:02:25.709> but<00:02:25.980> I

00:02:26.150 --> 00:02:26.160 
for example in this case I got 344 but I

00:02:26.160 --> 00:02:29.270 
for example in this case I got 344 but I
got<00:02:26.849> good<00:02:27.030> speed<00:02:27.330> of<00:02:27.480> only<00:02:27.599> 232<00:02:28.560> megabytes<00:02:29.160> per

00:02:29.270 --> 00:02:29.280 
got good speed of only 232 megabytes per

00:02:29.280 --> 00:02:32.690 
got good speed of only 232 megabytes per
second<00:02:29.880> so<00:02:30.239> now<00:02:31.019> we'll<00:02:31.170> be<00:02:31.319> looking<00:02:31.590> at<00:02:31.980> the

00:02:32.690 --> 00:02:32.700 
second so now we'll be looking at the

00:02:32.700 --> 00:02:34.520 
second so now we'll be looking at the
maximum<00:02:33.030> rate<00:02:33.480> speed<00:02:33.840> that<00:02:34.049> was<00:02:34.200> able<00:02:34.470> to

00:02:34.520 --> 00:02:34.530 
maximum rate speed that was able to

00:02:34.530 --> 00:02:37.460 
maximum rate speed that was able to
squeeze<00:02:34.920> out<00:02:35.100> so<00:02:35.340> in<00:02:35.400> this<00:02:35.489> case<00:02:36.470> 236

00:02:37.460 --> 00:02:37.470 
squeeze out so in this case 236

00:02:37.470 --> 00:02:39.860 
squeeze out so in this case 236
megabytes<00:02:37.950> per<00:02:38.069> second<00:02:38.640> let's<00:02:39.030> say<00:02:39.330> connects

00:02:39.860 --> 00:02:39.870

I've<00:02:46.470> got<00:02:46.799> quite<00:02:48.080> different<00:02:49.080> results<00:02:49.170> after

00:02:49.850 --> 00:02:49.860 
I've got quite different results after

00:02:49.860 --> 00:02:51.890 
I've got quite different results after
doing<00:02:50.130> the<00:02:50.340> same<00:02:50.549> amount<00:02:50.640> of<00:02:50.880> tests<00:02:51.360> as<00:02:51.540> I<00:02:51.690> did

00:02:51.890 --> 00:02:51.900 
doing the same amount of tests as I did

00:02:51.900 --> 00:02:55.940 
doing the same amount of tests as I did
with<00:02:52.080> sound<00:02:52.380> 1<00:02:52.849> so<00:02:54.110> this<00:02:55.110> is<00:02:55.170> a<00:02:55.290> free<00:02:55.590> test

00:02:55.940 --> 00:02:55.950 
with sound 1 so this is a free test

00:02:55.950 --> 00:03:00.020 
with sound 1 so this is a free test
because<00:02:56.760> the<00:02:57.540> Sony<00:02:58.310> time<00:02:59.310> and<00:02:59.489> I<00:02:59.519> was<00:02:59.670> able<00:02:59.819> to

00:03:00.020 --> 00:03:00.030 
because the Sony time and I was able to

00:03:00.030 --> 00:03:02.530 
because the Sony time and I was able to
achieve<00:03:00.530> 247<00:03:01.530> megabytes<00:03:01.890> per<00:03:01.980> second

00:03:02.530 --> 00:03:02.540 
achieve 247 megabytes per second

00:03:02.540 --> 00:03:04.940 
achieve 247 megabytes per second
actually<00:03:03.540> do<00:03:03.660> always<00:03:03.840> go<00:03:04.230> out<00:03:04.380> the<00:03:04.560> vault<00:03:04.709> has

00:03:04.940 --> 00:03:04.950 
actually do always go out the vault has

00:03:04.950 --> 00:03:09.620 
actually do always go out the vault has
set<00:03:05.190> it<00:03:05.540> but<00:03:07.250> generally<00:03:08.269> there's<00:03:09.269> slight

00:03:09.620 --> 00:03:09.630 
set it but generally there's slight

00:03:09.630 --> 00:03:11.690 
set it but generally there's slight
difference<00:03:10.140> Cooke<00:03:10.920> you've<00:03:11.100> compared<00:03:11.519> the

00:03:11.700 --> 00:03:14.259 
difference Cooke you've compared the
South<00:03:11.940> one<00:03:12.180> so<00:03:12.480> I<00:03:12.510> was<00:03:12.630> able<00:03:12.720> to<00:03:12.900> squeeze<00:03:13.140> out

00:03:14.259 --> 00:03:14.269 
South one so I was able to squeeze out

00:03:14.269 --> 00:03:17.509 
South one so I was able to squeeze out
238<00:03:15.269> megabytes<00:03:15.810> per<00:03:16.109> second<00:03:16.980> rate<00:03:17.220> speed

00:03:17.509 --> 00:03:17.519 
238 megabytes per second rate speed

00:03:17.519 --> 00:03:19.460 
238 megabytes per second rate speed
which<00:03:17.730> is<00:03:17.760> only<00:03:18.030> 2<00:03:18.329> megabytes<00:03:18.780> per<00:03:18.900> second

00:03:19.460 --> 00:03:19.470 
which is only 2 megabytes per second

00:03:19.470 --> 00:03:23.140 
which is only 2 megabytes per second
increase<00:03:20.370> so<00:03:21.239> the<00:03:21.420> score<00:03:21.750> I<00:03:22.079> was<00:03:22.230> able<00:03:22.530> to<00:03:22.680> get

00:03:23.140 --> 00:03:23.150 
increase so the score I was able to get

00:03:23.150 --> 00:03:26.630 
increase so the score I was able to get
346<00:03:24.150> which<00:03:24.959> is<00:03:25.049> only<00:03:25.260> 2<00:03:25.470> points<00:03:25.709> higher<00:03:26.310> than

346 which is only 2 points higher than
sat.1<00:03:27.480> cables<00:03:28.290> so<00:03:28.530> it<00:03:28.620> looks<00:03:28.799> like<00:03:28.920> that<00:03:29.250> there

00:03:30.080 --> 00:03:30.090 
sat.1 cables so it looks like that there

00:03:30.090 --> 00:03:33.020 
sat.1 cables so it looks like that there
is<00:03:30.209> a<00:03:30.239> little<00:03:30.620> difference<00:03:31.670> between<00:03:32.670> using<00:03:32.850> the

so<00:04:09.480> here<00:04:09.930> there<00:04:10.170> is<00:04:10.200> the<00:04:10.610> comparison<00:04:11.610> result

00:04:12.080 --> 00:04:12.090

00:04:29.750 --> 00:04:29.760 
very little difference in terms of rate

00:04:29.760 --> 00:04:33.200 
very little difference in terms of rate

00:04:33.200 --> 00:04:33.210 
speeds when using different cables so

00:04:33.210 --> 00:04:37.400 
speeds when using different cables so
and<00:04:33.660> this<00:04:34.260> is<00:04:34.470> very<00:04:35.160> the<00:04:35.460> case<00:04:36.110> compared<00:04:37.110> south

the score is slightly lower but what we

00:05:15.539 --> 00:05:17.360 
the score is slightly lower but what we
look<00:05:15.690> for<00:05:15.720> is<00:05:16.229> a<00:05:16.260> rate<00:05:16.530> speeds<00:05:16.950> in<00:05:17.130> write

00:05:17.370 --> 00:05:21.560 
look for is a rate speeds in write
speeds<00:05:17.789> so<00:05:18.350> when<00:05:19.350> using<00:05:19.500> sada<00:05:19.950> to<00:05:20.310> cable<00:05:20.729> down

00:05:21.560 --> 00:05:21.570

00:06:23.960 --> 00:06:23.970 
looks like that either I missed out some

slightly about 1.5 gigabits per second

command using solder free cable so I

00:07:07.620 --> 00:07:09.590 
command using solder free cable so I
think<00:07:08.010> I'm<00:07:08.340> going<00:07:08.490> to<00:07:08.520> use<00:07:08.700> saw<00:07:08.940> to<00:07:09.180> cable

00:07:09.590 --> 00:07:09.600 
think I'm going to use saw to cable

00:07:09.600 --> 00:07:11.770 
think I'm going to use saw to cable
because<00:07:09.750> I've<00:07:09.900> got<00:07:10.110> much<00:07:10.440> other<00:07:10.710> motherboard
