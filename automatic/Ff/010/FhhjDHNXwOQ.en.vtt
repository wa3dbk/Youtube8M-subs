only<00:03:43.310> problem<00:03:43.670> I<00:03:43.790> have<00:03:43.970> is<00:03:44.000> that<00:03:44.180> the<00:03:44.300> head<00:03:44.480> is

00:03:44.620 --> 00:03:44.630

off<00:03:50.150> and<00:03:51.790> it<00:03:52.790> makes<00:03:52.970> it<00:03:53.150> harder<00:03:53.480> to<00:03:53.600> make

00:03:53.740 --> 00:03:53.750 
off and it makes it harder to make

00:03:53.750 --> 00:03:56.440 
off and it makes it harder to make
videos<00:03:54.200> or<00:03:54.500> stop<00:03:54.950> motions<00:03:55.370> when<00:03:55.820> the<00:03:56.000> head<00:03:56.210> is
