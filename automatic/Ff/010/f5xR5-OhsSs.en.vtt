00:00:30.890 --> 00:00:30.900 
bit confusing at times because many vsts

00:00:30.900 --> 00:00:33.770 
bit confusing at times because many vsts
which<00:00:31.800> are<00:00:31.949> freely<00:00:32.340> downloadable<00:00:32.969> via<00:00:33.570> the

installation<00:00:37.920> programs<00:00:38.760> which<00:00:39.030> we're<00:00:39.270> used

00:00:39.440 --> 00:00:39.450 
installation programs which we're used

00:00:39.450 --> 00:00:42.290 
installation programs which we're used
to<00:00:39.570> using<00:00:39.750> for<00:00:40.140> installing<00:00:40.500> software<00:00:40.860> so<00:00:41.430> we

00:00:42.290 --> 00:00:42.300 
to using for installing software so we

00:00:42.300 --> 00:00:44.119 
to using for installing software so we
end<00:00:42.420> up<00:00:42.540> having<00:00:42.600> to<00:00:42.930> manually<00:00:43.590> install<00:00:43.829> those

00:00:44.119 --> 00:00:44.129 
end up having to manually install those

00:00:44.129 --> 00:00:45.860 
end up having to manually install those
but<00:00:44.430> every<00:00:44.640> once<00:00:44.820> in<00:00:44.910> a<00:00:45.000> while<00:00:45.030> that<00:00:45.360> can<00:00:45.539> be<00:00:45.660> a

00:00:45.860 --> 00:00:45.870 
but every once in a while that can be a

64-bit<00:02:26.430> is<00:02:26.610> going<00:02:26.970> to<00:02:27.090> be<00:02:27.209> located<00:02:27.599> and<00:02:28.019> a

00:02:28.550 --> 00:02:28.560 
64-bit is going to be located and a

00:02:28.560 --> 00:02:30.650 
64-bit is going to be located and a

00:02:30.660 --> 00:02:33.890 
number of plugins are currently not
64-bit<00:02:31.560> or<00:02:31.739> some<00:02:32.400> of<00:02:32.519> them<00:02:32.670> offer<00:02:32.940> different

00:02:33.890 --> 00:02:33.900 
64-bit or some of them offer different

00:02:33.900 --> 00:02:38.030 
64-bit or some of them offer different
versions<00:02:34.319> one<00:02:34.440> in<00:02:34.739> 32-bit<00:02:35.250> one<00:02:35.640> in<00:02:35.790> 64<00:02:36.390> so<00:02:37.349> be

00:02:38.030 --> 00:02:38.040 
versions one in 32-bit one in 64 so be

00:02:38.040 --> 00:02:39.350 
versions one in 32-bit one in 64 so be
