00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.230
 Hello friends on your screens 

00:00:01.530 --> 00:00:06.690
 I'm married again and today we are so 

00:00:04.230 --> 00:00:09.000
 unusual genre let's watch 

00:00:06.690 --> 00:00:11.070
 yes yes it is much worse than it was explay but 

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:12.540
 even worse is that we will today 

00:00:11.070 --> 00:00:14.880
 watch namely 

00:00:12.540 --> 00:00:17.010
 advertising the fact is that usually I donâ€™t 

00:00:14.880 --> 00:00:19.439
 I watch channels that are designed for 

00:00:17.010 --> 00:00:22.100
 wide audience I mainly watch 

00:00:19.439 --> 00:00:24.840
 channels on which only movies or 

00:00:22.100 --> 00:00:27.930
 non-fiction broadcasts but here 

00:00:24.840 --> 00:00:30.990
 I recently watched a regular channel this 

00:00:27.930 --> 00:00:31.859
 I thought I had advertising on my mouth 

00:00:30.990 --> 00:00:36.110
 barney 

00:00:31.859 --> 00:00:39.120
 I thought so very strange and I 

00:00:36.110 --> 00:00:43.550
 searched for yu tuba more advertising board 

00:00:39.120 --> 00:00:44.670
 and now we look at one of them and 

00:00:43.550 --> 00:00:46.730
 barney 

00:00:44.670 --> 00:00:50.750
 I'll show you so much interesting 

00:00:46.730 --> 00:00:54.120
 you saw the same thing as me 

00:00:50.750 --> 00:00:57.539
 teddy bear are imaginary apparently because 

00:00:54.120 --> 00:01:00.870
 mother did not notice him called the boy in 

00:00:57.539 --> 00:01:09.119
 closet going into the closet he saw there some 

00:01:00.870 --> 00:01:13.950
 new country of rye field, see he 

00:01:09.119 --> 00:01:16.470
 amused myself in a fictional country with 

00:01:13.950 --> 00:01:19.470
 fictional friend and little bear 

00:01:16.470 --> 00:01:22.040
 and it really scares me when I remember that 

00:01:19.470 --> 00:01:25.590
 still talking about products for kids 

00:01:22.040 --> 00:01:28.890
 but let's look at the climax 

00:01:25.590 --> 00:01:31.980
 I don't see anagrams for the whole biscuit event 

00:01:28.890 --> 00:01:36.330
 when it is difficult for me to comment on it 

00:01:31.980 --> 00:01:37.590
 it seems the guy is so immersed in 

00:01:36.330 --> 00:01:40.620
 hallucinations 

00:01:37.590 --> 00:01:43.580
 that he couldn't even walk to the closet and 

00:01:40.620 --> 00:01:48.360
 just crashed to the floor halfway 

00:01:43.580 --> 00:01:51.410
 that is, I certainly understand that the nursery 

00:01:48.360 --> 00:01:53.700
 fantasy is limitless and all that but 

00:01:51.410 --> 00:01:58.680
 fantasy advertisers she 

00:01:53.700 --> 00:02:01.110
 but she is adult and good at doing children 

00:01:58.680 --> 00:02:05.190
 advertising but bad deal with advertising under 

00:02:01.110 --> 00:02:06.350
 hard drugs it's definitely not for 

00:02:05.190 --> 00:02:09.660
 children 

00:02:06.350 --> 00:02:11.580
 true friend of inquisitive visionaries well 

00:02:09.660 --> 00:02:13.590
 and the end of advertising is generally gorgeous if 

00:02:11.580 --> 00:02:16.260
 do you have an imaginary friend bear 

00:02:13.590 --> 00:02:19.370
 just folded it don't think about anything 

00:02:16.260 --> 00:02:23.400
 eat horseradish eat 

00:02:19.370 --> 00:02:26.930
 It seems to me that with such advertisements it is necessary 

00:02:23.400 --> 00:02:29.600
 tie on tv with you was marrying 

00:02:26.930 --> 00:02:31.590
