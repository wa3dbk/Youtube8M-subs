 and also has connection for vica 

00:00:02.610 --> 00:00:07.410
 men who of course like to feel good 

00:00:04.740 --> 00:00:09.599
 I want to know is the Arabica today 

00:00:07.410 --> 00:00:10.650
 What is the man for? 

00:00:09.599 --> 00:00:12.960
 that is vain 

00:00:10.650 --> 00:00:15.269
 Good morning to you at home and to-day. 

00:00:12.960 --> 00:00:17.850
 We can already observe both after 

00:00:15.269 --> 00:00:20.640
 of social networks is that men are 

00:00:17.850 --> 00:00:22.439
 more vain on the issue of hair in 

00:00:20.640 --> 00:00:24.510
 The question of vine in the matter has 

00:00:22.439 --> 00:00:26.699
 makeup because there are some 

00:00:24.510 --> 00:00:28.920
 imperfections do not want to leave with this 

00:00:26.699 --> 00:00:30.890
 imperfection there are numerous tricks 

00:00:28.920 --> 00:00:33.120
 also for men and this is not 

00:00:30.890 --> 00:00:35.399
 too aggressive to male makeup 

00:00:33.120 --> 00:00:37.590
 that the one who works for television has already 

00:00:35.399 --> 00:00:39.960
 it's very common and true you here see all 

00:00:37.590 --> 00:00:42.840
 The world is always there. 

00:00:39.960 --> 00:00:45.329
 gets into the air and there are lots of 

00:00:42.840 --> 00:00:46.620
 as you get better for the man what 

00:00:45.329 --> 00:00:48.600
 we have here right? 

00:00:46.620 --> 00:00:50.070
 What I 'm going to do until I do something 

00:00:48.600 --> 00:00:53.100
 application here a demonstration in me 

00:00:50.070 --> 00:00:54.809
 that my skin is shiny and how I am 

00:00:53.100 --> 00:00:57.300
 without makeup you can observe in 

00:00:54.809 --> 00:00:59.219
 home the brightness that stands out a little more 

00:00:57.300 --> 00:01:01.020
 due to the lighting on his behalf and 

00:00:59.219 --> 00:01:01.829
 in the question of the photo also when I hit 

00:01:01.020 --> 00:01:04.350
 flash 

00:01:01.829 --> 00:01:07.110
 the skin gets a bit shiny then here 

00:01:04.350 --> 00:01:10.170
 we have some people's colors 

00:01:07.110 --> 00:01:12.840
 and will look for what will be legal in 

00:01:10.170 --> 00:01:14.729
 your skin and you will make a slight 

00:01:12.840 --> 00:01:17.369
 application only to remove the brightness of your 

00:01:14.729 --> 00:01:19.650
 skin will apply with the brush hit 

00:01:17.369 --> 00:01:22.860
 Noodles to hand like I always say and will 

00:01:19.650 --> 00:01:24.720
 make an athlete the only application for 

00:01:22.860 --> 00:01:27.540
 take off the shine of the skin will not stay 

00:01:24.720 --> 00:01:29.310
 nothing so masked because neither is it 

00:01:27.540 --> 00:01:32.520
 this intention that man wants 

00:01:29.310 --> 00:01:35.040
 demonstrate that it is in makeup but you 

00:01:32.520 --> 00:01:37.890
 you already realize that it is already getting 

00:01:35.040 --> 00:01:39.720
 A little more opaque I dani the makeup and 

00:01:37.890 --> 00:01:41.270
 will the skin become more uniform if 

00:01:39.720 --> 00:01:44.100
 have a little stain you want to hide 

00:01:41.270 --> 00:01:46.200
 it can also be used 

00:01:44.100 --> 00:01:50.640
 a concealer as well as can be used 

00:01:46.200 --> 00:01:52.649
 on a basis will depend on the agreement of the 

00:01:50.640 --> 00:01:55.200
 result that it has the final result 

00:01:52.649 --> 00:01:57.780
 and people are adapting to this 

00:01:55.200 --> 00:01:59.369
 skin will see that you will believe that you 

00:01:57.780 --> 00:02:02.130
 has no imperfection and sometimes 

00:01:59.369 --> 00:02:03.990
 has lately been already able 

00:02:02.130 --> 00:02:06.210
 accompany on behalf of some singers 

00:02:03.990 --> 00:02:08.520
 some artists the whole beard issue 

00:02:06.210 --> 00:02:10.780
 world is leaving a beard right then it is 

00:02:08.520 --> 00:02:13.300
 There is a skirt trick I do not have 

00:02:10.780 --> 00:02:15.400
 not that closed beard like yours 

00:02:13.300 --> 00:02:17.319
 we can leave our beards closed 

00:02:15.400 --> 00:02:20.050
 like mine, like some singers who 

00:02:17.319 --> 00:02:23.650
 appear and there too the makeup is not 

00:02:20.050 --> 00:02:26.500
 natural I thought it is a secret zinho 

00:02:23.650 --> 00:02:30.370
 it is easy to us is to move to 

00:02:26.500 --> 00:02:33.100
 you here you will need the 

00:02:30.370 --> 00:02:34.870
 black shadow of your wife you take there 

00:02:33.100 --> 00:02:37.870
 the black shadow of his wife and goes 

00:02:34.870 --> 00:02:38.739
 need a brush with an eye for 

00:02:37.870 --> 00:02:42.630
 and smoking 

00:02:38.739 --> 00:02:46.959
 then you will apply the black shadow 

00:02:42.630 --> 00:02:49.239
 will take the excess is in hand and then 

00:02:46.959 --> 00:02:51.940
 You'll see here or just doing a 

00:02:49.239 --> 00:02:54.660
 Slight movement to mark the 

00:02:51.940 --> 00:02:58.950
 bullet automatically you already see 

00:02:54.660 --> 00:03:02.260
 She's closed and here I'm just disappearing. 

00:02:58.950 --> 00:03:05.100
 very delicate very delicate nothing much 

00:03:02.260 --> 00:03:06.310
 heavy so that that effect does not 

00:03:05.100 --> 00:03:08.860
 makeup 

00:03:06.310 --> 00:03:11.819
 soon you will begin to observe from a 

00:03:08.860 --> 00:03:14.319
 side of my skin that 

00:03:11.819 --> 00:03:16.209
 there is a huge difference 

00:03:14.319 --> 00:03:18.700
 on this side you already have her more closed 

00:03:16.209 --> 00:03:20.079
 from this other you have more spaces there myself 

00:03:18.700 --> 00:03:21.220
 I have what we're going to do. 

00:03:20.079 --> 00:03:23.680
 on the other side only 

00:03:21.220 --> 00:03:27.730
 brushing to lather in this 

00:03:23.680 --> 00:03:29.890
 issue of the bar and the photos and at night 

00:03:27.730 --> 00:03:32.110
 it gets a perfect finish 

00:03:29.890 --> 00:03:35.230
 here you are already learning nothing 

00:03:32.110 --> 00:03:38.920
 which already makes a huge difference in 

00:03:35.230 --> 00:03:41.590
 makeup and the bar will put more 

00:03:38.920 --> 00:03:43.870
 I do not know if it's already this much 

00:03:41.590 --> 00:03:45.459
 Isabel is you going after you deposited 

00:03:43.870 --> 00:03:47.109
 always a little bit but always in the year 

00:03:45.459 --> 00:03:50.109
 passed the excess because what happens 

00:03:47.109 --> 00:03:52.090
 I will here make purposeful 

00:03:50.109 --> 00:03:53.440
 It's what happens I did not take the excess 

00:03:52.090 --> 00:03:56.470
 when I came here 

00:03:53.440 --> 00:03:59.440
 he already brand is already fully marked 

00:03:56.470 --> 00:04:01.870
 visible that you are in makeup you come 

00:03:59.440 --> 00:04:04.510
 trying to get the most out of it 

00:04:01.870 --> 00:04:05.260
 with your finger to take that look off 

00:04:04.510 --> 00:04:07.360
 Marketplace 

00:04:05.260 --> 00:04:10.299
 but even so it will stay in some 

00:04:07.360 --> 00:04:12.010
 regions deposited an additional amount of 

00:04:10.299 --> 00:04:16.329
 so it 's always good that you take the 

00:04:12.010 --> 00:04:19.239
 and apply, I 'm just sending in the 

00:04:16.329 --> 00:04:20.350
 issue of the band always taking the 

00:04:19.239 --> 00:04:22.479
 of makeup 

00:04:20.350 --> 00:04:24.160
 here you saw that on this side this 

00:04:22.479 --> 00:04:27.400
 side is already applied I just go here 

00:04:24.160 --> 00:04:29.830
 in the battery version on top of the bar 

00:04:27.400 --> 00:04:33.010
 that the accompaniment is the beetle and I 

00:04:29.830 --> 00:04:34.750
 I do not have this meeting of the beard that 

00:04:33.010 --> 00:04:37.210
 men also many have others too 

00:04:34.750 --> 00:04:46.630
 are failures something you can do just give 

00:04:37.210 --> 00:04:48.430
 a slight blurry made-up makeup 

00:04:46.630 --> 00:04:50.440
 where you can already see the 

00:04:48.430 --> 00:04:52.419
 the difference before and after my 

00:04:50.440 --> 00:04:54.970
 skin a little brighter I will not have 

00:04:52.419 --> 00:04:57.250
 totally the brightness I left is to give a 

00:04:54.970 --> 00:04:58.690
 little more natural but can deposit 

00:04:57.250 --> 00:05:01.600
 First we're in a fight. 

00:04:58.690 --> 00:05:03.340
 in an aluminum lava where you 

00:05:01.600 --> 00:05:05.020
 will was a more ambient light there 

00:05:03.340 --> 00:05:07.300
 will remain and perceptive this issue of 

00:05:05.020 --> 00:05:10.090
 makeup but everything is simple tips that 

00:05:07.300 --> 00:05:12.849
 still enjoys the products of the wife of 

00:05:10.090 --> 00:05:14.470
 girlfriend who does not have a single 

00:05:12.849 --> 00:05:17.080
 can also buy do not I will 

00:05:14.470 --> 00:05:19.150

00:05:17.080 --> 00:05:21.340
 to do this and smoke the bar a little 

00:05:19.150 --> 00:05:23.800
 and bought a powder according to his skin 

00:05:21.340 --> 00:05:25.389
 there are many positions on the market and 

00:05:23.800 --> 00:05:28.120
 sunscreen that will also help 

00:05:25.389 --> 00:05:31.389
 much of this treatment issue is 

00:05:28.120 --> 00:05:33.729

00:05:33.729 --> 00:05:37.139
 Light 

00:05:34.770 --> 00:05:39.690

00:05:37.139 --> 00:05:43.440
 to cast the shadow is the one we always want 

00:05:39.690 --> 00:05:44.550
 a little more and in the application of 

00:05:43.440 --> 00:05:46.919
 compensate 

00:05:44.550 --> 00:05:50.370
 in the bar we will want less 

00:05:46.919 --> 00:05:52.919
