00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.109
 body today we'll talk about the third 

00:00:04.710 --> 00:00:11.130
 types 3 types of facades 

00:00:07.109 --> 00:00:15.320
 It is painted MDF facades here before you 

00:00:11.130 --> 00:00:18.029
 see yourself in principle a small set of 

00:00:15.320 --> 00:00:23.960
 a huge number of different options 

00:00:18.029 --> 00:00:26.189
 painted facades are frosted facades 

00:00:23.960 --> 00:00:28.800
 look frosted facade 

00:00:26.189 --> 00:00:33.180
 if the facade is perfect no inclusions 

00:00:28.800 --> 00:00:40.670
 nothing just frosted on you see 

00:00:33.180 --> 00:00:47.910
 this chameleon chameleon is pure color 

00:00:40.670 --> 00:00:51.149
 coral can be anyone else will announce 

00:00:47.910 --> 00:00:53.699
 the facade is metallic the same clean 

00:00:51.149 --> 00:00:55.860
 light can only be added to it 

00:00:53.699 --> 00:00:59.329
 special inclusion like which 

00:00:55.860 --> 00:01:02.010
 create metallica 

00:00:59.329 --> 00:01:04.769
 advantage to painted facades 

00:01:02.010 --> 00:01:08.340
 Well, in principle, the price category is possible 

00:01:04.769 --> 00:01:10.409
 say they have high high if we 

00:01:08.340 --> 00:01:13.920
 We speak of course about high-quality facades 

00:01:10.409 --> 00:01:16.650
 if we speak ordinary then it is not at all 

00:01:13.920 --> 00:01:21.090
 e not sitting here before you are 

00:01:16.650 --> 00:01:23.549
 painted facades of the highest price category 

00:01:21.090 --> 00:01:27.570
 and superior quality what is in short 

00:01:23.549 --> 00:01:31.200
 tell you the technology if you look 

00:01:27.570 --> 00:01:34.710
 on a high-quality facade then you basically 

00:01:31.200 --> 00:01:35.460
 notice no inclusion no 

00:01:34.710 --> 00:01:38.340
 shagreens 

00:01:35.460 --> 00:01:41.460
 here you can see this facade 

00:01:38.340 --> 00:01:44.549
 the mass of the final can be seen as you would at it 

00:01:41.460 --> 00:01:47.899
 did not watch you will see nothing but 

00:01:44.549 --> 00:01:51.750
 perfect mirror surface 

00:01:47.899 --> 00:01:53.990
 achieved very seriously grinding them 

00:01:51.750 --> 00:01:56.460
 at different levels i.e. primer 

00:01:53.990 --> 00:02:00.750
 paint varnish 

00:01:56.460 --> 00:02:02.340
 all this is polished and then it turns out 

00:02:00.750 --> 00:02:06.970
 really 

00:02:02.340 --> 00:02:07.750
 painted facade is very high quality and 

00:02:06.970 --> 00:02:10.690
 expensive 

00:02:07.750 --> 00:02:13.420
 looking ie these facades have n't 

00:02:10.690 --> 00:02:14.110
 nothing to do with simple painted 

00:02:13.420 --> 00:02:17.230
 facades 

00:02:14.110 --> 00:02:19.450
 let's say so with cheaper ones all 

00:02:17.230 --> 00:02:21.280
 They say that it is painted facades such 

00:02:19.450 --> 00:02:23.910
 the facade is simply made in from the window 

00:02:21.280 --> 00:02:27.340
 MDF paint is applied and that's it 

00:02:23.910 --> 00:02:30.490
 end and people say that's super 

00:02:27.340 --> 00:02:35.070
 painted facades are cool is that is well 

00:02:30.490 --> 00:02:39.040
 we are talking about serious facades right here 

00:02:35.070 --> 00:02:41.020
 principle facades and provided this in 

00:02:39.040 --> 00:02:44.440
 Basically samples we constantly vadim 

00:02:41.020 --> 00:02:47.560
 we carry with it therefore there are scratches 

00:02:44.440 --> 00:02:49.000
 all sorts you can see here but exactly 

00:02:47.560 --> 00:02:53.380
 the quality itself 

00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:57.370
 gloss is here originally close 

00:02:53.380 --> 00:02:59.980
 to ideal you can say perfect they are 

00:02:57.370 --> 00:03:02.530
 by the way can be painted out of two 

00:02:59.980 --> 00:03:04.510
 parties all well all shiva now they see 

00:03:02.530 --> 00:03:07.209
 expressed on the one hand but if desired 

00:03:04.510 --> 00:03:10.300
 can be painted from two sides they 

00:03:07.209 --> 00:03:13.209
 absolutely will not be not afraid of water not 

00:03:10.300 --> 00:03:18.190
 the couple are not afraid of anything that is behind them 

00:03:13.209 --> 00:03:21.310
 usually take care and in principle all 

00:03:18.190 --> 00:03:23.470
 a very large number of flowers that is 

00:03:21.310 --> 00:03:25.170
 You can choose there I do not know there 

00:03:23.470 --> 00:03:26.960
 two hundred and three hundred 

00:03:25.170 --> 00:03:30.580
 shades 

00:03:26.960 --> 00:03:34.010
 metallic pure pure color 

00:03:30.580 --> 00:03:36.670
 various chameleons here by the way in very 

00:03:34.010 --> 00:03:41.510
 beautiful cream with 

00:03:36.670 --> 00:03:45.650
 see the blue blue attack unity 

00:03:41.510 --> 00:03:46.160
 hydrogen will go by example near 

00:03:45.650 --> 00:03:48.740
 kitchens 

00:03:46.160 --> 00:03:50.600
 that is, the entire facade will be as in 

00:03:48.740 --> 00:03:54.440
 million pour from cream 

00:03:50.600 --> 00:03:56.630
 on some gently gently gently to blue 

00:03:54.440 --> 00:03:59.390
 or ultra violet color is very 

00:03:56.630 --> 00:04:02.360
 beautiful x methods by the way there and 

00:03:59.390 --> 00:04:05.690
 tricolor chameleon that is for example 

00:04:02.360 --> 00:04:08.810
 cream can be blue if it is rusty 

00:04:05.690 --> 00:04:11.630
 there is green there, well, that is 

00:04:08.810 --> 00:04:14.840
 technology principle we have and more 

00:04:11.630 --> 00:04:18.260
 complex tricolor chameleons well in 

00:04:14.840 --> 00:04:23.030
 In principle, the most important thing is how I already 

00:04:18.260 --> 00:04:24.910
 said business is your choice choice postpone 

00:04:23.030 --> 00:04:30.790
 for you that is short 

00:04:24.910 --> 00:04:36.580
 remind here you see painted facades 

00:04:30.790 --> 00:04:42.650
 it is in principle expensive but very beautiful 

00:04:36.580 --> 00:04:44.770
 it looks very prestigious 

00:04:42.650 --> 00:04:44.770
 array 

00:04:45.100 --> 00:04:49.060
 this is from the facades of the array 

00:04:49.289 --> 00:04:56.460
 and here in this kitchen provided facades 

00:04:54.599 --> 00:05:01.830
 film 

00:04:56.460 --> 00:05:05.969
 but high-quality film qualities of MDF 

00:05:01.830 --> 00:05:07.979
 facades matter of choice for you by price 

00:05:05.969 --> 00:05:12.210
 categories the principle of letters and speak it 

00:05:07.979 --> 00:05:14.569
 MDF facades and array means this 

00:05:12.210 --> 00:05:20.599
 lower price category paw speaking 

00:05:14.569 --> 00:05:24.619
 further goes more expensive array is even more expensive 

00:05:20.599 --> 00:05:28.050
 the choice is yours Dnipropetrovsk 

00:05:24.619 --> 00:05:31.559
