think it's like 295 or something like

00:01:15.119 --> 00:01:16.609 
think it's like 295 or something like
that<00:01:15.330> or<00:01:15.509> it<00:01:15.570> might<00:01:15.689> be<00:01:15.720> a<00:01:15.840> dollar<00:01:16.080> ninety<00:01:16.470> five

00:01:16.609 --> 00:01:16.619 
that or it might be a dollar ninety five

00:01:16.619 --> 00:01:19.490

00:01:21.590 --> 00:01:21.600 
searches for three days for that price

00:01:21.600 --> 00:01:23.719

00:02:24.930 --> 00:02:26.720 
I won't go through the whole list but
you<00:02:25.230> can<00:02:25.410> see<00:02:25.590> here<00:02:25.980> all<00:02:26.400> the<00:02:26.700> different

00:02:26.720 --> 00:02:26.730 
you can see here all the different

00:02:26.730 --> 00:02:29.210 
you can see here all the different
checks<00:02:27.630> that<00:02:27.750> you<00:02:27.840> can<00:02:28.020> do<00:02:28.200> and<00:02:28.560> again<00:02:29.070> it's

00:02:29.210 --> 00:02:29.220 
checks that you can do and again it's

00:02:29.220 --> 00:02:31.490 
checks that you can do and again it's
unlimited<00:02:29.640> for<00:02:30.030> like<00:02:30.180> three<00:02:30.480> days<00:02:30.510> you<00:02:31.380> get

00:02:31.490 --> 00:02:31.500 
unlimited for like three days you get

00:02:31.500 --> 00:02:33.500 
unlimited for like three days you get
unlimited<00:02:31.830> access<00:02:32.190> and<00:02:32.730> then<00:02:32.850> I<00:02:32.880> think<00:02:33.360> it's

00:02:33.500 --> 00:02:33.510 
unlimited access and then I think it's

00:02:33.510 --> 00:02:36.710 
unlimited access and then I think it's
like<00:02:33.660> 20<00:02:33.990> bucks<00:02:34.110> or<00:02:34.470> 25<00:02:35.220> bucks<00:02:35.490> a<00:02:35.670> month<00:02:35.820> after

00:02:36.710 --> 00:02:36.720 
like 20 bucks or 25 bucks a month after

00:02:36.720 --> 00:02:38.570 
like 20 bucks or 25 bucks a month after
that<00:02:36.900> so<00:02:37.200> make<00:02:37.800> sure<00:02:37.830> if<00:02:38.070> you<00:02:38.160> don't<00:02:38.340> want<00:02:38.490> to
