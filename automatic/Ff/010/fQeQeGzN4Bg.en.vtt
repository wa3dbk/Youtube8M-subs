UV<00:01:56.009> tubing<00:01:56.400> superpower<00:01:56.939> I<00:01:57.060> guess<00:01:57.329> you<00:01:57.479> can

00:01:57.590 --> 00:01:57.600 
UV tubing superpower I guess you can

00:01:57.600 --> 00:02:00.020 
UV tubing superpower I guess you can
call<00:01:57.750> it<00:01:57.930> the<00:01:58.110> dragon<00:01:58.740> duelist<00:01:59.280> girl<00:01:59.460> capital

00:02:00.020 --> 00:02:00.030 
call it the dragon duelist girl capital

00:02:00.030 --> 00:02:02.030 
call it the dragon duelist girl capital
G<00:02:00.240> connection<00:02:01.079> we'd<00:02:01.259> be<00:02:01.380> getting<00:02:01.560> a<00:02:01.829> lot<00:02:02.009> more

00:02:02.030 --> 00:02:02.040

G connection we'd be getting a lot more
subscribers<00:02:02.820> views<00:02:03.450> but<00:02:03.990> definitely<00:02:04.619> the

subscribers views but definitely the

00:02:04.770 --> 00:02:06.260

00:02:06.260 --> 00:02:06.270 
most important we'd be getting a lot

00:02:06.270 --> 00:02:09.410 
most important we'd be getting a lot
more<00:02:06.329> residual<00:02:06.899> income<00:02:07.590> I<00:02:07.829> guess<00:02:08.790> in<00:02:08.970> simpler

00:02:09.410 --> 00:02:09.420 
more residual income I guess in simpler

00:02:09.420 --> 00:02:10.910 
more residual income I guess in simpler

00:03:10.449 --> 00:03:10.459 
would grow stronger I wouldn't just

00:03:10.459 --> 00:03:12.280 
would grow stronger I wouldn't just
think<00:03:10.670> of<00:03:10.790> these<00:03:10.940> girls<00:03:11.239> as<00:03:11.569> partners<00:03:12.079> that<00:03:12.260> I

or<00:03:15.049> even<00:03:15.799> as<00:03:15.920> time<00:03:16.190> went<00:03:16.370> on<00:03:16.459> even<00:03:16.760> further

00:03:16.990 --> 00:03:17.000 
or even as time went on even further

00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:19.180 
or even as time went on even further
they'd<00:03:17.599> probably<00:03:17.840> start<00:03:18.319> being<00:03:18.560> like<00:03:18.620> sisters

00:03:19.180 --> 00:03:19.190

00:03:27.430 --> 00:03:27.440 
that's definitely money and since I

00:03:27.440 --> 00:03:29.020 
that's definitely money and since I
