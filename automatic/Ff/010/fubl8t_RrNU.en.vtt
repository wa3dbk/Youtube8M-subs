straight
rather<00:00:50.219> than<00:00:50.460> blow-drying<00:00:50.940> a<00:00:51.059> flat<00:00:51.300> ironing

00:00:51.680 --> 00:00:51.690 
rather than blow-drying a flat ironing

00:00:51.690 --> 00:00:54.860 
rather than blow-drying a flat ironing
it<00:00:51.930> so<00:00:52.710> but<00:00:53.430> now<00:00:53.610> that<00:00:53.850> I'm<00:00:53.940> transitioning<00:00:54.449> I

00:00:54.860 --> 00:00:54.870 
it so but now that I'm transitioning I

00:00:54.870 --> 00:00:56.540 
it so but now that I'm transitioning I
have<00:00:54.989> a<00:00:55.050> feeling<00:00:55.500> and<00:00:55.829> so<00:00:56.100> far<00:00:56.399> I've<00:00:56.520> been

00:00:56.540 --> 00:00:56.550 
have a feeling and so far I've been

00:00:56.550 --> 00:00:58.310 
have a feeling and so far I've been
right<00:00:56.910> that<00:00:56.940> I<00:00:57.149> have<00:00:57.239> been<00:00:57.539> using<00:00:57.719> the<00:00:57.989> dryer<00:00:58.289> a

00:00:58.310 --> 00:00:58.320 
right that I have been using the dryer a

00:00:58.320 --> 00:01:01.849 
right that I have been using the dryer a
lot<00:00:58.710> more<00:00:58.980> to<00:00:59.190> stretch<00:00:59.550> out<00:00:59.789> my<00:00:59.850> length<00:01:00.539> and<00:01:00.859> so

00:01:01.849 --> 00:01:01.859 
lot more to stretch out my length and so

00:01:01.859 --> 00:01:03.500 
lot more to stretch out my length and so
the<00:01:02.100> upgrade<00:01:02.280> is<00:01:02.670> really<00:01:02.940> worth<00:01:03.090> it<00:01:03.270> to<00:01:03.300> get

00:01:03.500 --> 00:01:03.510 
the upgrade is really worth it to get

00:01:03.510 --> 00:01:06.530 
the upgrade is really worth it to get
something<00:01:03.690> quality<00:01:04.430> so<00:01:05.430> it<00:01:06.090> was<00:01:06.240> like<00:01:06.360> perfect

00:01:06.530 --> 00:01:06.540 
something quality so it was like perfect

00:01:06.540 --> 00:01:08.539

timing<00:01:06.840> the<00:01:07.650> blow<00:01:07.740> dryer<00:01:07.950> has<00:01:08.159> a<00:01:08.189> couple<00:01:08.490> of

00:01:08.539 --> 00:01:08.549 
timing the blow dryer has a couple of

00:01:08.549 --> 00:01:11.510

00:01:13.130 --> 00:01:13.140 
also has a high and low setting so it

00:01:13.140 --> 00:01:16.070

when you're working on your own head and
getting<00:01:36.600> in<00:01:36.780> the<00:01:36.840> middle<00:01:37.049> with<00:01:37.350> a<00:01:37.380> comb<00:01:37.890> I<00:01:38.340> mean

00:01:39.050 --> 00:01:39.060 
getting in the middle with a comb I mean

00:01:39.060 --> 00:01:40.249 
getting in the middle with a comb I mean
with<00:01:39.180> a<00:01:39.210> brush<00:01:39.509> and<00:01:39.750> you're<00:01:39.900> using<00:01:40.170> the

00:01:40.249 --> 00:01:40.259 
with a brush and you're using the

00:01:40.259 --> 00:01:41.840 
with a brush and you're using the
tension<00:01:40.619> method<00:01:40.950> is<00:01:41.070> a<00:01:41.100> little<00:01:41.549> bit<00:01:41.670> more

00:01:41.840 --> 00:01:41.850 
tension method is a little bit more

00:01:41.850 --> 00:01:43.700 
tension method is a little bit more
difficult<00:01:42.390> so<00:01:42.509> I<00:01:42.630> do<00:01:42.750> wish<00:01:43.049> that<00:01:43.259> I<00:01:43.290> had<00:01:43.470> a<00:01:43.500> comb

00:01:43.700 --> 00:01:43.710 
difficult so I do wish that I had a comb

00:01:43.710 --> 00:01:45.649 
difficult so I do wish that I had a comb
attachment<00:01:43.860> but<00:01:44.549> that's<00:01:44.820> fine<00:01:45.119> I<00:01:45.450> mean<00:01:45.509> it

00:01:45.649 --> 00:01:45.659 
attachment but that's fine I mean it

00:01:45.659 --> 00:01:47.899 
attachment but that's fine I mean it
works<00:01:45.869> really<00:01:46.590> well<00:01:46.829> and<00:01:47.100> super<00:01:47.399> fast<00:01:47.610> so

00:01:47.899 --> 00:01:47.909 
works really well and super fast so

00:01:47.909 --> 00:01:49.310 
works really well and super fast so
