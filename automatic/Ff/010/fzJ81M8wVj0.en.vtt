and then I repeat this step then I'll go

00:01:20.670 --> 00:01:24.630 
and then I repeat this step then I'll go
under<00:01:21.670> the<00:01:21.820> dumbbell<00:01:22.180> I<00:01:22.740> over<00:01:23.740> the<00:01:23.829> hook<00:01:24.039> under

00:01:38.620 --> 00:01:38.630 

00:01:38.630 --> 00:01:40.820 

and<00:01:39.630> what<00:01:39.750> that<00:01:39.900> does<00:01:40.020> is<00:01:40.080> kind<00:01:40.380> of<00:01:40.440> lock<00:01:40.650> it

00:01:40.820 --> 00:01:40.830 
and what that does is kind of lock it

00:01:40.830 --> 00:01:43.580 
and what that does is kind of lock it
