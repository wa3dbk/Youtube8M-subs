00:00:03.870 --> 00:00:08.870
 we find ourselves a second race a bit 

00:00:06.270 --> 00:00:08.870
 strange 

00:00:11.840 --> 00:00:16.890
 and I know what has been the main thing is what 

00:00:14.340 --> 00:00:21.210
 there is which king to close or not 

00:00:16.890 --> 00:00:22.740
 you do not need perfect here we go 

00:00:21.210 --> 00:00:24.119
 at the same second do not ask how 

00:00:22.740 --> 00:00:25.740
 when the last one came out he did not have 

00:00:24.119 --> 00:00:27.840
 depression but the case is the second and 

00:00:25.740 --> 00:00:29.400
 that's what matters and this gentleman is 

00:00:27.840 --> 00:00:31.199
 the one who goes first and is going to catch a 

00:00:29.400 --> 00:00:34.170
 just a little bit more to the river 

00:00:31.199 --> 00:00:36.809
 so that it refreshes me unless 

00:00:34.170 --> 00:00:38.640
 eye but the point is worth I do not know how they are going 

00:00:36.809 --> 00:00:41.370

00:00:38.640 --> 00:00:43.079

00:00:41.370 --> 00:00:44.460
 this gentleman there is excuse and worlwide there 

00:00:43.079 --> 00:00:47.070
 ramps forgiveness you have to catch the birds 

00:00:44.460 --> 00:00:49.450
 are these diets and this nap without 

00:00:47.070 --> 00:00:50.890
 that catch my friends is like that 

00:00:49.450 --> 00:00:52.900
 I think there was no need to do it 

00:00:50.890 --> 00:00:54.730
 especially like that but I said well 

00:00:52.900 --> 00:00:58.740
 but you had to take which king but 

00:00:54.730 --> 00:00:58.740

00:00:59.340 --> 00:01:02.730
 come on guys 

00:01:03.600 --> 00:01:10.150
 but for most it is worth but it does not happen 

00:01:07.870 --> 00:01:11.590
 nothing because we're going to catch the slipstream and 

00:01:10.150 --> 00:01:13.410
 we are going to catch all of them first 

00:01:11.590 --> 00:01:16.410
 yes champions that we go to 

00:01:13.410 --> 00:01:16.410

00:01:17.740 --> 00:01:21.950
 same I am happy 

00:01:19.940 --> 00:01:23.450
 the first one that is flying and is 

00:01:21.950 --> 00:01:25.159
 looking for the sky, it seems that 

00:01:23.450 --> 00:01:26.990
 oxygen particles from that area then 

00:01:25.159 --> 00:01:29.930
 they are a bit hard 

00:01:26.990 --> 00:01:31.340
 come on ok this is where I'm stuck 

00:01:29.930 --> 00:01:33.970

00:01:31.340 --> 00:01:33.970

 power to that in three laps less 

00:01:47.270 --> 00:01:51.170
 older to give time to catch him I think 

00:01:49.640 --> 00:01:54.369
 that he's going to give and he started whistling 

00:01:51.170 --> 00:01:54.369
 here you do not need 

00:01:59.679 --> 00:02:05.090
