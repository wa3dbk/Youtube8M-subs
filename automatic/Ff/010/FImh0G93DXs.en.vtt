nice<00:01:36.500> to<00:01:36.619> warm<00:01:36.830> here<00:01:37.040> with<00:01:37.130> the<00:01:37.220> down<00:01:37.340> pipe

00:01:37.630 --> 00:01:37.640

there<00:01:39.130> so<00:01:40.130> what<00:01:40.250> I<00:01:40.280> did<00:01:40.369> is<00:01:40.580> I<00:01:40.670> just<00:01:40.700> extended

00:01:41.020 --> 00:01:41.030 
there so what I did is I just extended

00:01:41.030 --> 00:01:42.940 
there so what I did is I just extended
the<00:01:41.270> ground<00:01:41.539> over<00:01:41.840> to<00:01:41.929> somewhere<00:01:42.229> else<00:01:42.319> for

00:01:42.940 --> 00:01:42.950 
the ground over to somewhere else for

00:01:42.950 --> 00:01:45.490 
the ground over to somewhere else for
now<00:01:43.130> and<00:01:43.819> it<00:01:44.030> was<00:01:44.090> working<00:01:44.420> great<00:01:44.450> so<00:01:45.080> I'll

00:01:45.490 --> 00:01:45.500 
now and it was working great so I'll

00:01:45.500 --> 00:01:47.050 
now and it was working great so I'll
probably<00:01:45.649> put<00:01:45.890> a<00:01:45.950> thicker<00:01:46.190> gauge<00:01:46.399> wire<00:01:46.700> on<00:01:46.940> it

00:01:47.050 --> 00:01:47.060 
probably put a thicker gauge wire on it

00:01:47.060 --> 00:01:48.790 
probably put a thicker gauge wire on it
but<00:01:47.179> that<00:01:47.270> one's<00:01:47.450> pretty<00:01:47.600> thick<00:01:47.899> that's<00:01:48.649> like

00:01:48.790 --> 00:01:48.800 
but that one's pretty thick that's like

00:01:48.800 --> 00:01:51.279 
but that one's pretty thick that's like
a<00:01:48.860> 10<00:01:49.100> it's<00:01:49.819> been<00:01:49.940> working<00:01:50.240> really<00:01:50.390> good<00:01:50.720> so<00:01:51.080> I

00:01:51.279 --> 00:01:51.289 
a 10 it's been working really good so I

00:01:51.289 --> 00:01:53.559 
a 10 it's been working really good so I
drove<00:01:51.560> it<00:01:51.709> to<00:01:51.740> get<00:01:51.890> gas<00:01:52.130> I'll<00:01:53.119> put<00:01:53.300> up<00:01:53.330> some

00:01:53.559 --> 00:01:53.569 
drove it to get gas I'll put up some

00:01:53.569 --> 00:01:55.540 
drove it to get gas I'll put up some
pictures<00:01:53.929> and<00:01:54.410> at<00:01:54.560> the<00:01:54.649> gas<00:01:54.800> station<00:01:55.280> it<00:01:55.399> looks

00:01:55.540 --> 00:01:55.550 
pictures and at the gas station it looks

00:01:55.550 --> 00:01:59.320 
pictures and at the gas station it looks
nice<00:01:56.740> other<00:01:57.740> than<00:01:57.950> that<00:01:58.100> it's<00:01:58.910> doing<00:01:59.209> really

can admire it now I'm happy and it's
running<00:02:14.900> about<00:02:15.230> my<00:02:16.069> data<00:02:16.310> logged<00:02:16.580> I<00:02:17.090> think<00:02:17.480> six

00:02:17.710 --> 00:02:17.720 
running about my data logged I think six

00:02:17.720 --> 00:02:20.470 
running about my data logged I think six
pounds<00:02:18.050> boost<00:02:18.880> like<00:02:19.880> right<00:02:20.060> around<00:02:20.240> a<00:02:20.270> hundred

00:02:20.470 --> 00:02:20.480 
pounds boost like right around a hundred

00:02:20.480 --> 00:02:22.870 
pounds boost like right around a hundred
fifty<00:02:20.690> KPI<00:02:20.990> six<00:02:21.319> or<00:02:21.440> seven<00:02:21.800> and<00:02:21.920> only<00:02:22.430> thirteen

00:02:22.870 --> 00:02:22.880 
fifty KPI six or seven and only thirteen

00:02:22.880 --> 00:02:24.400 
fifty KPI six or seven and only thirteen
degrees<00:02:23.030> of<00:02:23.270> timing<00:02:23.390> in<00:02:23.690> it<00:02:23.780> right<00:02:23.900> now<00:02:23.959> until

00:02:24.400 --> 00:02:24.410 
degrees of timing in it right now until

00:02:24.410 --> 00:02:26.740 
degrees of timing in it right now until
I<00:02:24.530> turn<00:02:24.770> it<00:02:24.890> up<00:02:25.010> just<00:02:25.940> to<00:02:26.420> make<00:02:26.450> sure<00:02:26.569> our

00:02:26.740 --> 00:02:26.750 
I turn it up just to make sure our

00:02:26.750 --> 00:02:27.850 
I turn it up just to make sure our
fueling<00:02:27.140> and<00:02:27.260> everything<00:02:27.500> has<00:02:27.590> been<00:02:27.709> doing

00:02:27.850 --> 00:02:27.860 
fueling and everything has been doing

00:02:27.860 --> 00:02:28.880 
fueling and everything has been doing
good<00:02:28.130> I<00:02:28.190> stopped

00:02:28.880 --> 00:02:28.890 
good I stopped

00:02:28.890 --> 00:02:31.309 
good I stopped
station<00:02:29.190> up<00:02:29.280> to<00:02:29.370> five<00:02:29.580> gallons<00:02:29.850> in<00:02:30.330> and<00:02:31.020> it<00:02:31.230> was

00:02:31.309 --> 00:02:31.319 
station up to five gallons in and it was

00:02:31.319 --> 00:02:32.660 
station up to five gallons in and it was
a<00:02:31.350> little<00:02:31.590> bit<00:02:31.680> below<00:02:31.830> half<00:02:32.220> and<00:02:32.430> now<00:02:32.520> it's<00:02:32.550> a

00:02:32.660 --> 00:02:32.670 
a little bit below half and now it's a

00:02:32.670 --> 00:02:34.790 
a little bit below half and now it's a
little<00:02:32.850> bit<00:02:32.970> below<00:02:33.180> full<00:02:33.480> so<00:02:34.260> I<00:02:34.290> think<00:02:34.560> this

00:02:34.790 --> 00:02:34.800 
little bit below full so I think this

00:02:34.800 --> 00:02:36.770 
little bit below full so I think this
tank<00:02:35.160> holds<00:02:35.490> a<00:02:35.520> pretty<00:02:35.760> good<00:02:35.940> amount<00:02:36.120> like<00:02:36.360> 16

00:02:36.770 --> 00:02:36.780 
tank holds a pretty good amount like 16

00:02:36.780 --> 00:02:39.260 
tank holds a pretty good amount like 16
