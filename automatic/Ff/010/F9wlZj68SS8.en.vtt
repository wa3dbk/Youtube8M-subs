a little slide there okay so that's just
um<00:05:55.020> that's<00:05:56.020> just<00:05:56.139> octaves<00:05:56.710> with<00:05:56.919> that<00:05:57.130> is<00:05:57.310> you

00:05:57.779 --> 00:05:57.789 
um that's just octaves with that is you

00:05:57.789 --> 00:06:00.510 
um that's just octaves with that is you

got your root note mm and then drop two

00:06:00.520 --> 00:06:02.490 
got your root note mm and then drop two
strings<00:06:00.880> down<00:06:01.120> and<00:06:01.419> two<00:06:01.570> frets<00:06:01.840> higher<00:06:02.050> so

00:06:02.490 --> 00:06:02.500 
strings down and two frets higher so

00:06:02.500 --> 00:06:05.000 
strings down and two frets higher so
like<00:06:02.620> a<00:06:02.650> power<00:06:02.919> cord<00:06:03.250> but<00:06:03.460> skip<00:06:03.669> a<00:06:03.699> string

like a power cord but skip a string
there's<00:06:06.010> the<00:06:06.190> octave<00:06:06.550> to<00:06:06.639> whatever<00:06:06.910> know<00:06:07.090> what

00:06:07.200 --> 00:06:07.210

00:06:09.820 --> 00:06:11.820 
you playing over here if it's on the
first<00:06:10.240> two<00:06:10.479> strings<00:06:10.720> if<00:06:11.260> it's<00:06:11.410> down<00:06:11.590> on<00:06:11.650> the

00:06:11.820 --> 00:06:11.830 
first two strings if it's down on the

00:06:11.830 --> 00:06:13.439 
first two strings if it's down on the
third<00:06:12.100> string<00:06:12.430> on<00:06:12.669> the<00:06:12.760> fourth<00:06:13.000> string<00:06:13.030> up<00:06:13.330> the

00:06:13.439 --> 00:06:13.449 
third string on the fourth string up the

00:06:13.449 --> 00:06:15.270 
third string on the fourth string up the
D<00:06:13.600> string<00:06:13.810> then<00:06:14.440> that<00:06:14.650> changes<00:06:15.010> everything

00:06:15.270 --> 00:06:15.280 
D string then that changes everything

00:06:15.280 --> 00:06:16.830 
D string then that changes everything
because<00:06:15.460> your<00:06:15.820> B<00:06:16.000> string<00:06:16.300> is<00:06:16.419> tuned<00:06:16.599> down<00:06:16.780> a

00:06:16.830 --> 00:06:16.840 
because your B string is tuned down a

00:06:16.840 --> 00:06:18.300 
because your B string is tuned down a
half<00:06:17.080> step<00:06:17.139> so<00:06:17.410> you're<00:06:17.650> gonna<00:06:17.740> have<00:06:17.800> to<00:06:18.010> spread

00:06:18.300 --> 00:06:18.310 
half step so you're gonna have to spread

00:06:18.310 --> 00:06:23.240 
half step so you're gonna have to spread
it<00:06:18.460> one<00:06:18.639> more<00:06:18.760> time<00:06:20.280> anyway<00:06:21.280> so<00:06:21.520> we<00:06:21.610> gotta<00:06:21.789> g
