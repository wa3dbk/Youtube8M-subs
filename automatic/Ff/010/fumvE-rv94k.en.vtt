off<00:00:41.660> relatively<00:00:42.320> first<00:00:43.100> of<00:00:43.370> the<00:00:43.550> year<00:00:43.670> I<00:00:43.730> was

00:00:44.520 --> 00:00:44.530

tiger which she good from Luca who they
all<00:01:37.740> come<00:01:38.069> down<00:01:38.219> and<00:01:38.429> they're<00:01:38.520> quite<00:01:38.640> amazed

00:01:38.929 --> 00:01:38.939 
all come down and they're quite amazed

00:01:38.939 --> 00:01:42.050 
all come down and they're quite amazed
them<00:01:39.209> what<00:01:39.719> we<00:01:39.869> can<00:01:40.020> actually<00:01:40.200> do<00:01:40.500> and<00:01:41.060> the

00:01:42.050 --> 00:01:42.060 
them what we can actually do and the

00:01:42.060 --> 00:01:43.789 
them what we can actually do and the
package<00:01:42.420> together<00:01:42.600> along<00:01:43.079> with<00:01:43.110> the<00:01:43.319> car<00:01:43.500> and

00:01:43.789 --> 00:01:43.799 
package together along with the car and

00:01:43.799 --> 00:01:45.319 
package together along with the car and
the<00:01:43.979> driver<00:01:44.250> is<00:01:44.429> definitely<00:01:44.909> what<00:01:45.030> you<00:01:45.090> need

00:01:45.319 --> 00:01:45.329 
the driver is definitely what you need

00:01:45.329 --> 00:01:47.090 
the driver is definitely what you need
