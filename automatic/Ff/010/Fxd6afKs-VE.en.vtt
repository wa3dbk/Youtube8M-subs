00:00:06.630 --> 00:00:10.889
 hello people how are you welcome here 

00:00:08.670 --> 00:00:12.750
 back to records and this time we're going 

00:00:10.889 --> 00:00:15.600
 to learn how to synchronize our 

00:00:12.750 --> 00:00:17.310
 gmail account in windows 8 since 

00:00:15.600 --> 00:00:19.890
 apparently microsoft is a bit 

00:00:17.310 --> 00:00:21.960
 closed in this aspect of accounts but 

00:00:19.890 --> 00:00:23.880
 that does not mean it's bad at 

00:00:21.960 --> 00:00:25.860
 opposite is very good since we can 

00:00:23.880 --> 00:00:28.739
 synchronize our hotmail account 

00:00:25.860 --> 00:00:30.660
 our old gmail account 

00:00:28.739 --> 00:00:34.530
 ok first of all let's go to the 

00:00:30.660 --> 00:00:36.480
 lower left corner and we're going to 

00:00:34.530 --> 00:00:38.220
 give it at the beginning and here it will appear 

00:00:36.480 --> 00:00:41.040
 the applications and everything that we 

00:00:38.220 --> 00:00:43.890
 let's go ok we're going to go to the tab 

00:00:41.040 --> 00:00:45.810
 or rather the box that says mail and 

00:00:43.890 --> 00:00:47.340
 here we already have to have it if 

00:00:45.810 --> 00:00:48.930
 is an updated version after the 

00:00:47.340 --> 00:00:50.370
 January 30, it seems to me that they already owe 

00:00:48.930 --> 00:00:52.920
 of having our very informed in this 

00:00:50.370 --> 00:00:55.260
 appearance of updates but if in the 

00:00:52.920 --> 00:00:57.120
 case of the cdl that about you not 

00:00:55.260 --> 00:01:01.510
 I have downloaded it on the tab 

00:00:57.120 --> 00:01:04.210
 shop and ok let's go to mail 

00:01:01.510 --> 00:01:06.250
 here I had already tried to use this 

00:01:04.210 --> 00:01:08.680
 account but I removed them to go back to 

00:01:06.250 --> 00:01:10.840
 do the tutorial and ok let's put it 

00:01:08.680 --> 00:01:12.399
 in this tab is the one that you 

00:01:10.840 --> 00:01:14.560
 You must go out and add your account 

00:01:12.399 --> 00:01:16.720
 microsoft for this process is 

00:01:14.560 --> 00:01:20.590
 totally necessary that you have 

00:01:16.720 --> 00:01:23.320
 a microsoft account is totally 

00:01:20.590 --> 00:01:25.149
 necessary in this if it is something that does not 

00:01:23.320 --> 00:01:27.369
 will like many but some yes 

00:01:25.149 --> 00:01:29.830
 et cetera but this is like a kind of 

00:01:27.369 --> 00:01:31.450
 entry pass this is like the base if 

00:01:29.830 --> 00:01:34.300
 once we had what was the 

00:01:31.450 --> 00:01:36.759
 messenger we should also know 

00:01:34.300 --> 00:01:39.970
 that the account that only accepted 

00:01:36.759 --> 00:01:42.880
 messenger was that of hotmail therefore 

00:01:39.970 --> 00:01:44.770
 we have to have some if you're from this 

00:01:42.880 --> 00:01:47.319
 new generation that we still say 

00:01:44.770 --> 00:01:49.090
 you are 12 13 14 years old if you did not reach 

00:01:47.319 --> 00:01:52.869
 know well what was the messenger 

00:01:49.090 --> 00:01:54.700
 create one in the forgiveness account in the 

00:01:52.869 --> 00:01:57.580
 microsoft page gives you the option to 

00:01:54.700 --> 00:02:00.520
 create a hotmail account and so you can 

00:01:57.580 --> 00:02:03.220
 enter this part ok in this case already 

00:02:00.520 --> 00:02:04.630
 I put mine is a very old account but 

00:02:03.220 --> 00:02:07.420
 now if I can not show them so 

00:02:04.630 --> 00:02:08.380
 same for security over everything and here 

00:02:07.420 --> 00:02:11.350
 already 

00:02:08.380 --> 00:02:13.120
 and we are going to give him in keeping this 

00:02:11.350 --> 00:02:15.760
 tab will automatically send us 

00:02:13.120 --> 00:02:17.290
 to our inbox in this 

00:02:15.760 --> 00:02:18.940
 case I did not blame him for years but 

00:02:17.290 --> 00:02:22.450
 they appear has messed me up good post 

00:02:18.940 --> 00:02:24.700
 that does not bother me at all and ok ya 

00:02:22.450 --> 00:02:27.370
 after we are in the 

00:02:24.700 --> 00:02:29.860
 Inbox we're going to go to the 

00:02:27.370 --> 00:02:32.650
 upper right corner this time in 

00:02:29.860 --> 00:02:35.110
 this part and here we are going to know five 

00:02:32.650 --> 00:02:38.320
 new options and something in what 

00:02:35.110 --> 00:02:40.120
 confuse new users this man these 

00:02:38.320 --> 00:02:41.230
 options are not only start and 

00:02:40.120 --> 00:02:43.660
 that if they do the same in any 

00:02:41.230 --> 00:02:45.160
 tab be desk or start or 

00:02:43.660 --> 00:02:48.070
 wherever it is they are going to leave them 

00:02:45.160 --> 00:02:50.260
 5 but each depending the 

00:02:48.070 --> 00:02:52.570
 application where we are is where 

00:02:50.260 --> 00:02:54.910
 will notice the difference here we are going to 

00:02:52.570 --> 00:02:57.400
 give configuration and we're going to go to 

00:02:54.910 --> 00:02:59.140
 accounts in accounts we will see that nothing 

00:02:57.400 --> 00:03:01.390
 more hotmail is going to come out because it's the 

00:02:59.140 --> 00:03:03.610
 only we have just entered we are going to 

00:03:01.390 --> 00:03:05.970
 give in adding account and we will leave 

00:03:03.610 --> 00:03:09.520
 four new options that says bloc 

00:03:05.970 --> 00:03:11.020
 google another account and yahoo simply 

00:03:09.520 --> 00:03:13.860
 we will give in the account that we 

00:03:11.020 --> 00:03:15.420
 we want and so we have yahoo google 

00:03:13.860 --> 00:03:17.580
 another account that I really have no idea 

00:03:15.420 --> 00:03:20.940
 which one would we simply give in 

00:03:17.580 --> 00:03:23.360
 google and here we are going to put our 

00:03:20.940 --> 00:03:23.360
 mail 

00:03:25.790 --> 00:03:30.280
 and then our password obviously 

00:03:32.870 --> 00:03:37.340
 ok now if something in which most of 

00:03:35.569 --> 00:03:39.019
 users get confused if you 

00:03:37.340 --> 00:03:40.879
 They include your contacts 

00:03:39.019 --> 00:03:43.030
 calendar is google is not going to 

00:03:40.879 --> 00:03:43.030
 to accept 

00:03:43.250 --> 00:03:47.520
 definitely not going to accept them 

00:03:44.820 --> 00:03:49.430
 because if we do this 

00:03:47.520 --> 00:03:51.409
 pass this 

00:03:49.430 --> 00:03:53.450
 can not connect with proof that the 

00:03:51.409 --> 00:03:56.060
 information is correct I do not know if it's a 

00:03:53.450 --> 00:04:00.700
 google microsoft error but I do not know 

00:03:56.060 --> 00:04:00.700
 can we instead uncheck this 

00:04:01.090 --> 00:04:07.330
 and we entered the account ok then 

00:04:04.450 --> 00:04:10.000
 we already have access to our 

00:04:07.330 --> 00:04:12.730
 account and remember something you can not 

00:04:10.000 --> 00:04:14.500
 remove this thing can not be removed 

00:04:12.730 --> 00:04:17.799
 hotmail 

00:04:14.500 --> 00:04:20.919
 so put him here in accounts and then 

00:04:17.799 --> 00:04:23.110
 give him in hotmail and after here he says 

00:04:20.919 --> 00:04:25.240
 activated if a mail signature 

00:04:23.110 --> 00:04:28.360
 electronic activated everything all this all 

00:04:25.240 --> 00:04:32.070
 can not be turned off can not be left 

00:04:28.360 --> 00:04:36.400
 only the gmail because they observe this 

00:04:32.070 --> 00:04:38.740
 we go to gmail and it says here it says remove 

00:04:36.400 --> 00:04:41.350
 account and remove it without problems but 

00:04:38.740 --> 00:04:44.080
 on the other hand, if we enter hotmail, it will 

00:04:41.350 --> 00:04:45.850
 say remove all the force accounts 

00:04:44.080 --> 00:04:48.160
 you need a hotmail account to 

00:04:45.850 --> 00:04:50.080
 can enter the good gmail 

00:04:48.160 --> 00:04:51.970
 friends yes thank you very much for having 

00:04:50.080 --> 00:04:54.789
 seen this tutorial any doubt 

00:04:51.970 --> 00:04:57.010
 put in description of the video or sorry 

00:04:54.789 --> 00:04:58.630
 in comments of the video and wait for the 

00:04:57.010 --> 00:05:00.820
 next tutorial since I'm going to 

00:04:58.630 --> 00:05:04.270
 teach how 

00:05:00.820 --> 00:05:06.160
 how to modify this part of the 

00:05:04.270 --> 00:05:07.540
 windows so that it stays this way 

00:05:06.160 --> 00:05:09.580
 we still can not put images 

00:05:07.540 --> 00:05:11.560
 personalized but I hope to find 

00:05:09.580 --> 00:05:15.420
 some application that makes it good 

00:05:11.560 --> 00:05:15.420
 friends this was all and even
