00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.040
 because it gives bad combase table today 

00:00:02.820 --> 00:00:06.480
 again a saving recipe because I 

00:00:05.040 --> 00:00:08.849
 or we have at 

00:00:06.480 --> 00:00:12.090
 Browse through the magazine and magazine 

00:00:08.849 --> 00:00:13.950
 Although it is the april edition of this 

00:00:12.090 --> 00:00:17.910
 Recipe you discovered for an asparagus 

00:00:13.950 --> 00:00:19.949
 Flammkuchen and yes I just found that 

00:00:17.910 --> 00:00:21.900
 right there or looks right 

00:00:19.949 --> 00:00:24.000
 good and wanted that necessarily times 

00:00:21.900 --> 00:00:25.500
 try and we think 

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:27.000
 Just take a video out of that 

00:00:25.500 --> 00:00:30.240
 author of this concept is 

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:31.590
 firebird and that's why there are too 

00:00:30.240 --> 00:00:34.680
 this video no pdf to download 

00:00:31.590 --> 00:00:37.350
 from me but instead the link to 

00:00:34.680 --> 00:00:38.730
 this recipe on chefkoch.de now 

00:00:37.350 --> 00:00:39.090
 Let's look at the ingredients very quickly 

00:00:38.730 --> 00:00:40.410
 on 

00:00:39.090 --> 00:00:42.780
 because the dough has to be still a while 

00:00:40.410 --> 00:00:45.690
 go and I already have it right 

00:00:42.780 --> 00:00:48.210
 hunger for four flammkuchen we have 

00:00:45.690 --> 00:00:50.789
 here 200 grams of flour 16 bars of asparagus 

00:00:48.210 --> 00:00:52.620
 The recipe will include eight white and eight 

00:00:50.789 --> 00:00:54.390
 green but since we take the green 

00:00:52.620 --> 00:00:58.520
 I would rather eat 16 

00:00:54.390 --> 00:01:02.070
 green taken 100 gram basin slices 

00:00:58.520 --> 00:01:03.629
 we need some pepper salt from it 

00:01:02.070 --> 00:01:05.159
 a teaspoon for the dough and still 

00:01:03.629 --> 00:01:09.420
 something in addition to seasoning the 

00:01:05.159 --> 00:01:11.790
 Flammkuchen 15 grams of fresh yeast 300 

00:01:09.420 --> 00:01:15.659
 gramme crème fraiche four tablespoons 

00:01:11.790 --> 00:01:16.280
 olive oil and 125 milliliters lukewarm 

00:01:15.659 --> 00:01:18.780
 water 

00:01:16.280 --> 00:01:22.229
 for the dough, we first see the flour 

00:01:18.780 --> 00:01:24.450
 in a bowl then we mix it 

00:01:22.229 --> 00:01:29.159
 with a teaspoon of salt and form in the 

00:01:24.450 --> 00:01:30.720
 in the middle of a hollow in the comes the yeast 

00:01:29.159 --> 00:01:33.470
 into which we first with the 

00:01:30.720 --> 00:01:33.470
 Dissolve lukewarm water 

00:01:42.440 --> 00:01:48.220
 We'll work on that first 

00:01:44.060 --> 00:01:48.220
 a hook that is well mixed 

00:01:49.660 --> 00:01:53.420
 Knead on a floured work surface 

00:01:52.280 --> 00:01:56.330
 I am then to a smooth 

00:01:53.420 --> 00:01:59.680
 dough then we covered between 30 

00:01:56.330 --> 00:01:59.680
 minutes and a school leave 

00:02:01.060 --> 00:02:05.210
 in the meantime, we already prepare 

00:02:03.500 --> 00:02:07.370
 time the documents before and cut the 

00:02:05.210 --> 00:02:09.140
 I just put it in strips 

00:02:07.370 --> 00:02:11.060
 the whole slice over each other 

00:02:09.140 --> 00:02:14.240
 They all together and cut them 

00:02:11.060 --> 00:02:16.960
 pieces again in about 1 to 15 cm thick 

00:02:14.240 --> 00:02:16.960
 strip small 

00:02:17.620 --> 00:02:22.220
 Let us now come to the asparagus with which we 

00:02:20.540 --> 00:02:24.530
 cut off the lower ends 

00:02:22.220 --> 00:02:28.040
 and if necessary the lower third 

00:02:24.530 --> 00:02:30.560
 the slant is cut in 

00:02:28.040 --> 00:02:33.980
 thin slices in about between 0 5 and 

00:02:30.560 --> 00:02:39.500
 one centimeter thick the heads 

00:02:33.980 --> 00:02:40.970
 Let's just halve it right now 

00:02:39.500 --> 00:02:43.100
 noticed that in this flammkuchen 

00:02:40.970 --> 00:02:45.470
 has not happened onions 

00:02:43.100 --> 00:02:47.960
 and since we are in the club too huge 

00:02:45.470 --> 00:02:50.390
 Onion falls are easy now 

00:02:47.960 --> 00:02:53.710
 a small red onion we in 

00:02:50.390 --> 00:02:53.710
 half-length cut small thin 

00:02:55.240 --> 00:02:58.780
 meanwhile our day is due 

00:02:56.560 --> 00:03:01.240
 for an estimated 45 minutes 

00:02:58.780 --> 00:03:04.290
 and only once in four equal 

00:03:01.240 --> 00:03:04.290
 divided portion 

00:03:08.450 --> 00:03:12.830
 These shapes then each balls 

00:03:10.819 --> 00:03:15.470
 Press flat and roll out thinly 

00:03:12.830 --> 00:03:17.840
 because we put our flammkuchen on one 

00:03:15.470 --> 00:03:19.870
 I will bake the 

00:03:17.840 --> 00:03:22.580
 dough directly on such a slide here 

00:03:19.870 --> 00:03:24.260
 roll out and I love these 

00:03:22.580 --> 00:03:26.180
 disputes come with neat mail 

00:03:24.260 --> 00:03:28.459
 so that the flammkuchen is ready 

00:03:26.180 --> 00:03:32.019
 then nice of the chihuahua on that 

00:03:28.459 --> 00:03:32.019
 it can slip on the stone 

00:03:40.900 --> 00:03:45.400
 It must be something like that with us 

00:03:43.500 --> 00:03:48.420
 We pass each one on 

00:03:45.400 --> 00:03:48.420
 quarter of the creme fraiche 

00:03:56.930 --> 00:04:00.370
 Season well with salt 

00:04:02.220 --> 00:04:10.370
 and also with the pepper distribute the 

00:04:07.380 --> 00:04:10.370
 asparagus on it 

00:04:16.329 --> 00:04:20.189
 fill the flammkuchen with the bacon 

00:04:21.539 --> 00:04:29.979
 and our onions must of course 

00:04:23.949 --> 00:04:31.240
 on it we dribble the whole thing 

00:04:29.979 --> 00:04:33.430
 with some olive oil 

00:04:31.240 --> 00:04:38.020
 I take about 1 tablespoon each 

00:04:33.430 --> 00:04:39.340
 Flammkuchen and spice up again 

00:04:38.020 --> 00:04:41.349
 I already have the crème fraiche friend with me 

00:04:39.340 --> 00:04:43.120
 Have spiced enough salt and gone now 

00:04:41.349 --> 00:04:45.639
 Yes , I am already early enough 

00:04:43.120 --> 00:04:48.789
 just add pepper in it 

00:04:45.639 --> 00:04:51.009
 the stove with it because it is now too 

00:04:48.789 --> 00:04:53.620
 not in the recipe but we had something 

00:04:51.009 --> 00:04:56.560
 pecorino over and go over mails 

00:04:53.620 --> 00:04:57.270
 the hot flames because can not 

00:04:56.560 --> 00:05:00.310
 damage 

00:04:57.270 --> 00:05:02.469
 according to the recipe for the flammkuchen at 250 

00:05:00.310 --> 00:05:04.479
 baked for ten to twelve minutes 

00:05:02.469 --> 00:05:06.460
 but we always do it as we always do 

00:05:04.479 --> 00:05:08.020
 make and bake our pizza 

00:05:06.460 --> 00:05:11.289
 just follow the tarte flambée 

00:05:08.020 --> 00:05:13.259
 feeling at 275 degrees air to the 

00:05:11.289 --> 00:05:15.819
 edges to loyal and looks like that 

00:05:13.259 --> 00:05:18.509
 I would estimate about five 

00:05:15.819 --> 00:05:20.560
 minutes it took 

00:05:18.509 --> 00:05:22.569
 quickly the delicious pecorino 

00:05:20.560 --> 00:05:26.009
 grate about it and then finally can 

00:05:22.569 --> 00:05:26.009
 be cut and tasted 

00:05:33.880 --> 00:05:38.010
 because if we times the good piece 

00:05:35.620 --> 00:05:38.010
 try 

00:05:48.400 --> 00:05:54.600
 I have to say it's really tasty so I 

00:05:51.550 --> 00:05:57.600
 I think that will definitely go up 

00:05:54.600 --> 00:05:57.600
 try 

00:06:08.810 --> 00:06:11.800
 and fit 

00:06:12.240 --> 00:06:14.569
 hmm 

00:06:18.230 --> 00:06:24.050
 I was not the asparagus fan 

00:06:19.550 --> 00:06:27.200
 but partly has more and more of 

00:06:24.050 --> 00:06:28.940
 the kind of preparation is as far as I am 

00:06:27.200 --> 00:06:33.400
 the best tarte we have so far 

00:06:28.940 --> 00:06:35.660
 definitely has done 

00:06:33.400 --> 00:06:38.570
 I hope you like the video 

00:06:35.660 --> 00:06:40.600
 has and I can give you this recipe 

00:06:38.570 --> 00:06:42.860
 definitely just recommend it 

00:06:40.600 --> 00:06:46.460
 this time i have my own recipe 

00:06:42.860 --> 00:06:49.840
 I do not have your own pdf 

00:06:46.460 --> 00:06:55.430
 written but the chef 

00:06:49.840 --> 00:06:59.450
 Lettering Chef left below 

00:06:55.430 --> 00:07:01.280
 linked and yes I definitely you 

00:06:59.450 --> 00:07:02.930
 can also recommend is a joke stone 

00:07:01.280 --> 00:07:06.410
 because I think there are the pizzas and 

00:07:02.930 --> 00:07:09.800
 Flammkuchen just so good 

00:07:06.410 --> 00:07:11.450
 no comparison to the tin and whether we 

00:07:09.800 --> 00:07:14.000
 already the red onions and in the 

00:07:11.450 --> 00:07:15.950
 July only keeps it that stays to you 

00:07:14.000 --> 00:07:27.700
