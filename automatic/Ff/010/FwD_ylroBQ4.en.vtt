00:01:16.010 --> 00:01:16.020 
which means it should run pretty

00:01:16.020 --> 00:01:18.469 
which means it should run pretty
smoothly<00:01:16.290> this<00:01:17.159> has<00:01:17.310> got<00:01:17.460> Snapdragon<00:01:18.000> 808

00:01:18.469 --> 00:01:18.479 
smoothly this has got Snapdragon 808

00:01:18.479 --> 00:01:21.980 
smoothly this has got Snapdragon 808
processor<00:01:19.080> arena<00:01:19.619> which<00:01:20.630> some<00:01:21.630> may<00:01:21.750> say<00:01:21.930> is

00:01:21.980 --> 00:01:21.990 
processor arena which some may say is

00:01:21.990 --> 00:01:23.270 
processor arena which some may say is
not<00:01:22.200> the<00:01:22.229> best<00:01:22.439> app<00:01:22.650> so<00:01:22.830> I'm<00:01:22.920> gonna<00:01:23.009> say<00:01:23.130> it's

00:01:23.270 --> 00:01:23.280 
not the best app so I'm gonna say it's

00:01:23.280 --> 00:01:25.100 
not the best app so I'm gonna say it's
good<00:01:23.490> is<00:01:23.640> okay<00:01:23.970> but<00:01:24.330> I<00:01:24.360> think<00:01:24.509> for<00:01:24.810> what<00:01:24.900> it<00:01:24.990> is

00:01:25.100 --> 00:01:25.110 
good is okay but I think for what it is

00:01:25.110 --> 00:01:26.749 
good is okay but I think for what it is
again<00:01:25.439> no<00:01:25.680> bloatware<00:01:25.920> this<00:01:26.460> should<00:01:26.610> run

00:01:26.749 --> 00:01:26.759 
again no bloatware this should run

00:01:26.759 --> 00:01:29.660 
again no bloatware this should run
pretty<00:01:27.030> smooth<00:01:27.299> it's<00:01:27.990> got<00:01:28.170> two<00:01:28.400> stereo<00:01:29.400> front

00:01:29.660 --> 00:01:29.670 
pretty smooth it's got two stereo front

00:01:29.670 --> 00:01:31.819 
pretty smooth it's got two stereo front
facing<00:01:30.030> speaker<00:01:30.509> there<00:01:30.689> as<00:01:30.780> well<00:01:30.990> let<00:01:31.619> me<00:01:31.680> just

00:01:31.819 --> 00:01:31.829 
facing speaker there as well let me just

00:01:31.829 --> 00:01:33.260 
facing speaker there as well let me just
turn<00:01:31.979> it<00:01:32.100> sideways<00:01:32.340> so<00:01:32.790> you<00:01:32.880> can<00:01:33.000> have<00:01:33.090> a<00:01:33.119> look

00:01:33.260 --> 00:01:33.270 
turn it sideways so you can have a look

00:01:33.270 --> 00:01:34.580 
turn it sideways so you can have a look
at<00:01:33.329> that<00:01:33.390> so<00:01:33.869> you<00:01:33.900> can<00:01:34.079> see<00:01:34.110> the<00:01:34.290> two<00:01:34.439> your

levels<00:01:58.469> which<00:01:58.710> is<00:01:58.829> good<00:01:59.009> let's<00:01:59.729> have<00:01:59.790> a<00:01:59.909> cut<00:02:00.060> it

00:02:00.139 --> 00:02:00.149

I believe so you can't you can't remove

00:02:50.200 --> 00:02:51.660 
I believe so you can't you can't remove
this<00:02:50.410> you<00:02:50.680> can't<00:02:50.860> change<00:02:51.040> the<00:02:51.250> battery<00:02:51.580> or

00:02:51.660 --> 00:02:51.670 
this you can't change the battery or

00:02:51.670 --> 00:02:53.160 
this you can't change the battery or
anything<00:02:51.850> like<00:02:52.030> that<00:02:52.120> but<00:02:52.510> you're<00:02:53.020> still

00:02:53.160 --> 00:02:53.170 
anything like that but you're still

00:02:53.170 --> 00:02:54.360 
anything like that but you're still
pretty<00:02:53.350> good<00:02:53.560> you've<00:02:53.680> got<00:02:53.709> a<00:02:53.800> big<00:02:53.980> battery<00:02:54.160> in

00:02:54.360 --> 00:02:54.370 
pretty good you've got a big battery in

00:02:55.890 --> 00:02:55.900 
there you've got turbo charge as well so

00:02:55.900 --> 00:02:57.360

you<00:02:55.989> can<00:02:56.110> actually<00:02:56.200> charge<00:02:56.560> this<00:02:56.830> faster<00:02:57.250> than

00:02:57.360 --> 00:02:57.370 
you can actually charge this faster than

00:02:57.370 --> 00:03:00.060 
you can actually charge this faster than
you<00:02:57.489> would<00:02:57.640> on<00:02:58.060> the<00:02:58.510> samsung<00:02:59.110> galaxy<00:02:59.500> s6<00:02:59.800> and
