from the desktop it does block them
pretty<00:01:15.180> much<00:01:15.210> like<00:01:15.509> all<00:01:15.659> rogues<00:01:15.930> really

00:01:16.600 --> 00:01:16.610

somebody's<00:01:17.610> running<00:01:17.850> safe<00:01:18.240> mode<00:01:18.509> some<00:01:18.869> of

00:01:18.950 --> 00:01:18.960 
somebody's running safe mode some of

00:01:18.960 --> 00:01:21.170 
somebody's running safe mode some of
them<00:01:19.049> don't<00:01:19.259> this<00:01:20.130> one<00:01:20.340> I<00:01:20.520> don't<00:01:20.640> think<00:01:21.030> it

00:01:21.170 --> 00:01:21.180 
them don't this one I don't think it

00:01:21.180 --> 00:01:22.789 
them don't this one I don't think it
runs<00:01:21.330> in<00:01:21.570> safe<00:01:21.780> mode<00:01:21.810> with<00:01:21.990> networking<00:01:22.110> so

00:01:22.789 --> 00:01:22.799 
runs in safe mode with networking so

00:01:22.799 --> 00:01:24.679 
runs in safe mode with networking so
that<00:01:22.950> is<00:01:23.070> probably<00:01:23.310> the<00:01:23.460> best<00:01:23.790> way<00:01:23.939> to<00:01:24.540> remove

00:01:24.679 --> 00:01:24.689 
that is probably the best way to remove

00:01:24.689 --> 00:01:26.330 
that is probably the best way to remove
that<00:01:24.869> and<00:01:25.290> if<00:01:25.560> you<00:01:25.619> want<00:01:25.770> to<00:01:25.830> get<00:01:25.920> into<00:01:26.040> safe

00:01:26.330 --> 00:01:26.340 
that and if you want to get into safe

00:01:26.340 --> 00:01:28.700 
that and if you want to get into safe
mode<00:01:26.369> with<00:01:26.610> networking<00:01:27.320> instructions<00:01:28.320> are<00:01:28.530> on

00:01:28.700 --> 00:01:28.710 
mode with networking instructions are on

00:01:28.710 --> 00:01:32.719 
mode with networking instructions are on
the<00:01:28.860> screen<00:01:29.159> right<00:01:29.759> now<00:01:31.220> ok<00:01:32.220> so<00:01:32.280> this<00:01:32.490> have<00:01:32.700> a

00:01:32.719 --> 00:01:32.729

eighty<00:01:51.180> nine<00:01:51.479> dollars<00:01:51.899> which<00:01:52.680> is<00:01:52.710> pretty

00:01:53.090 --> 00:01:53.100 
eighty nine dollars which is pretty

00:01:53.100 --> 00:01:55.399 
eighty nine dollars which is pretty
expensive<00:01:53.430> really<00:01:54.149> for<00:01:54.720> something<00:01:54.990> does<00:01:55.110> fake

00:01:55.399 --> 00:01:55.409 
expensive really for something does fake

00:01:55.409 --> 00:01:56.990 
expensive really for something does fake
that's<00:01:55.829> not<00:01:55.979> going<00:01:56.100> to<00:01:56.189> do<00:01:56.310> any<00:01:56.490> good<00:01:56.670> at<00:01:56.820> all

00:01:56.990 --> 00:01:57.000 
that's not going to do any good at all

00:01:57.000 --> 00:02:00.980 
that's not going to do any good at all
now<00:01:57.479> we'll<00:01:57.780> post<00:01:58.170> up<00:01:58.439> a<00:01:59.390> code<00:02:00.390> that<00:02:00.719> you<00:02:00.810> can

00:02:00.980 --> 00:02:00.990 
now we'll post up a code that you can

00:02:00.990 --> 00:02:02.840 
now we'll post up a code that you can
use<00:02:01.170> and<00:02:01.860> we<00:02:02.100> need<00:02:02.280> to<00:02:02.369> do<00:02:02.490> there<00:02:02.700> to

00:02:02.840 --> 00:02:02.850 
use and we need to do there to

00:02:02.850 --> 00:02:04.819 
use and we need to do there to
registration<00:02:03.270> on<00:02:03.659> that<00:02:04.049> code<00:02:04.320> you<00:02:04.799> just

00:02:04.819 --> 00:02:04.829 
registration on that code you just

00:02:04.829 --> 00:02:06.800 
registration on that code you just
activate<00:02:05.670> put<00:02:05.909> the<00:02:06.000> code<00:02:06.210> in<00:02:06.240> there<00:02:06.600> and

00:02:06.800 --> 00:02:06.810 
activate put the code in there and

00:02:06.810 --> 00:02:09.229 
activate put the code in there and
activate<00:02:07.710> and<00:02:07.920> the<00:02:07.950> code<00:02:08.640> is<00:02:08.670> on<00:02:08.819> the<00:02:09.030> screen

00:02:09.229 --> 00:02:09.239 
activate and the code is on the screen

00:02:09.239 --> 00:02:11.210 
activate and the code is on the screen
right<00:02:09.569> now<00:02:09.869> and<00:02:10.050> hopefully<00:02:10.530> that<00:02:10.830> should<00:02:10.860> do

00:02:11.210 --> 00:02:11.220 
right now and hopefully that should do

00:02:11.220 --> 00:02:12.949 
right now and hopefully that should do
it<00:02:11.250> for<00:02:11.370> you<00:02:11.730> as<00:02:11.910> well<00:02:12.060> if<00:02:12.270> you<00:02:12.390> wish<00:02:12.540> to<00:02:12.720> do<00:02:12.840> it

00:02:12.949 --> 00:02:12.959 
it for you as well if you wish to do it

00:02:12.959 --> 00:02:15.130 
it for you as well if you wish to do it
that<00:02:13.110> way

00:02:15.130 --> 00:02:15.140 
that way

00:02:15.140 --> 00:02:17.300 
that way
okay<00:02:16.140> so<00:02:16.200> let's<00:02:16.470> have<00:02:16.560> a<00:02:16.620> look<00:02:16.680> where<00:02:16.980> it<00:02:17.100> lives

00:02:17.300 --> 00:02:17.310 
okay so let's have a look where it lives

00:02:17.310 --> 00:02:19.430 
okay so let's have a look where it lives
basically<00:02:18.090> there's<00:02:18.270> a<00:02:18.330> little<00:02:18.540> shortcut<00:02:19.020> on

00:02:19.430 --> 00:02:19.440 
basically there's a little shortcut on

00:02:19.440 --> 00:02:21.020 
basically there's a little shortcut on
the<00:02:19.470> desktop<00:02:19.620> I<00:02:20.130> can<00:02:20.310> right<00:02:20.490> click<00:02:20.520> on<00:02:20.850> this

00:02:21.020 --> 00:02:21.030 
the desktop I can right click on this

00:02:21.030 --> 00:02:24.140 
the desktop I can right click on this
and<00:02:21.270> click<00:02:22.080> properties<00:02:22.230> and<00:02:22.800> I<00:02:23.370> concede<00:02:23.850> it's

00:02:24.140 --> 00:02:24.150 
and click properties and I concede it's

00:02:24.150 --> 00:02:26.750 
and click properties and I concede it's
in<00:02:24.300> programmed<00:02:24.750> data<00:02:25.050> on<00:02:25.440> a<00:02:25.500> Windows<00:02:26.100> 7

00:02:26.750 --> 00:02:26.760 
in programmed data on a Windows 7

00:02:26.760 --> 00:02:30.020 
in programmed data on a Windows 7
machine<00:02:27.830> so<00:02:28.830> we're<00:02:28.980> going<00:02:29.190> to<00:02:29.250> remove<00:02:29.790> that

00:02:30.020 --> 00:02:30.030 
machine so we're going to remove that

00:02:30.030 --> 00:02:31.760 
machine so we're going to remove that
from<00:02:30.360> the<00:02:30.450> system<00:02:30.840> and<00:02:31.050> there's<00:02:31.410> a<00:02:31.470> way<00:02:31.620> of

00:02:31.760 --> 00:02:31.770 
from the system and there's a way of

00:02:31.770 --> 00:02:32.810 
from the system and there's a way of
removing<00:02:32.040> that's<00:02:32.340> pretty<00:02:32.580> straightforward

00:02:32.810 --> 00:02:32.820 
removing that's pretty straightforward

00:02:32.820 --> 00:02:35.330 
removing that's pretty straightforward
as<00:02:33.180> I<00:02:33.270> said<00:02:33.480> we're<00:02:34.110> going<00:02:34.230> to<00:02:34.320> use<00:02:34.770> internet

00:02:35.330 --> 00:02:35.340 
as I said we're going to use internet

00:02:35.340 --> 00:02:37.520 
as I said we're going to use internet
explorer<00:02:35.880> so<00:02:36.600> hopefully<00:02:36.960> you've<00:02:37.050> not<00:02:37.200> removed

00:02:37.520 --> 00:02:37.530 
explorer so hopefully you've not removed

00:02:37.530 --> 00:02:39.370 
explorer so hopefully you've not removed
internet<00:02:37.860> explorer<00:02:38.250> from<00:02:38.400> your<00:02:38.550> system<00:02:38.820> and

00:02:39.370 --> 00:02:39.380 
internet explorer from your system and

00:02:39.380 --> 00:02:43.270 
internet explorer from your system and
we're<00:02:40.380> going<00:02:40.500> to<00:02:40.530> do<00:02:40.680> here<00:02:40.710> is<00:02:41.490> just<00:02:42.360> open<00:02:42.930> up

00:02:43.270 --> 00:02:43.280

00:03:14.420 --> 00:03:14.430 
this off getting more boxes popping up

00:03:14.430 --> 00:03:18.230 
this off getting more boxes popping up

so gonna ignore the warning and then you

00:03:18.240 --> 00:03:20.300 
so gonna ignore the warning and then you
should<00:03:18.480> get<00:03:18.660> your<00:03:18.810> download<00:03:19.260> okay<00:03:19.980> so<00:03:20.040> it's

do here is going to put this on to my
desktop<00:03:29.450> let<00:03:30.450> this<00:03:30.570> come<00:03:30.810> down<00:03:35.840> okay<00:03:36.840> that's

00:03:37.010 --> 00:03:37.020 
desktop let this come down okay that's

00:03:37.020 --> 00:03:39.380 
desktop let this come down okay that's
down<00:03:37.200> now<00:03:37.410> we<00:03:38.310> can<00:03:38.460> now<00:03:38.610> close<00:03:38.970> off<00:03:39.180> the

00:03:39.380 --> 00:03:39.390 
down now we can now close off the

00:03:39.390 --> 00:03:44.750 
down now we can now close off the
browser<00:03:41.000> and<00:03:42.860> the<00:03:43.860> first<00:03:44.040> thing<00:03:44.220> I<00:03:44.340> need<00:03:44.520> to<00:03:44.550> do

00:03:44.750 --> 00:03:44.760 
browser and the first thing I need to do

00:03:44.760 --> 00:03:46.670 
browser and the first thing I need to do
here<00:03:45.060> is<00:03:45.090> rename<00:03:45.690> this<00:03:45.900> file<00:03:46.170> because<00:03:46.530> it

00:03:46.670 --> 00:03:46.680 
here is rename this file because it

00:03:46.680 --> 00:03:48.350 
here is rename this file because it
won't<00:03:46.890> run<00:03:47.160> if<00:03:47.340> you<00:03:47.430> try<00:03:47.610> to<00:03:47.640> click<00:03:47.910> on<00:03:48.060> it<00:03:48.180> it

00:05:19.290 --> 00:05:19.300

also another good tool to run just to

00:06:08.980 --> 00:06:11.280 
also another good tool to run just to
make<00:06:09.190> sure<00:06:09.220> there's<00:06:09.669> no<00:06:09.880> other<00:06:10.090> root<00:06:10.840> kits<00:06:11.110> on

make sure there's no other root kits on
the<00:06:11.320> system<00:06:15.960> and<00:06:17.640> then<00:06:18.640> also<00:06:18.820> I<00:06:19.030> would<00:06:19.330> run

00:06:19.620 --> 00:06:19.630 
the system and then also I would run

00:06:19.630 --> 00:06:31.999 
the system and then also I would run
hitman<00:06:20.169> pro<00:06:20.410> as<00:06:20.560> well

00:06:31.999 --> 00:06:32.009 

00:06:32.009 --> 00:06:34.369
