the<00:00:06.540> head

00:00:07.419 --> 00:00:07.429 
the head

00:00:07.429 --> 00:00:10.060 
the head
I've<00:00:08.429> heard<00:00:08.670> the<00:00:08.910> tummy<00:00:09.210> bolt<00:00:09.510> on<00:00:09.660> this<00:00:09.750> car

00:00:10.060 --> 00:00:10.070 
I've heard the tummy bolt on this car

00:00:10.070 --> 00:00:12.980 
I've heard the tummy bolt on this car
it's<00:00:11.070> still<00:00:11.370> horrible<00:00:11.790> had<00:00:12.509> a<00:00:12.540> very<00:00:12.780> rough

00:00:12.980 --> 00:00:12.990 
it's still horrible had a very rough

00:00:12.990 --> 00:00:14.770 
it's still horrible had a very rough
funnel<00:00:13.349> and<00:00:13.500> had<00:00:13.590> a<00:00:13.620> very<00:00:13.830> bad<00:00:13.950> knocking<00:00:14.460> noise

00:00:14.770 --> 00:00:14.780 
funnel and had a very bad knocking noise

00:00:14.780 --> 00:00:17.810 
funnel and had a very bad knocking noise
so<00:00:15.780> being<00:00:16.710> that<00:00:16.830> this<00:00:17.070> car<00:00:17.279> is<00:00:17.310> about<00:00:17.550> ninety

00:00:17.810 --> 00:00:17.820 
so being that this car is about ninety

00:00:17.820 --> 00:00:20.390 
so being that this car is about ninety
six<00:00:18.060> ninety<00:00:18.150> seven<00:00:18.570> thousand<00:00:18.869> miles<00:00:19.050> I<00:00:19.400> was

00:00:20.390 --> 00:00:20.400 
six ninety seven thousand miles I was

00:00:20.400 --> 00:00:23.150 
six ninety seven thousand miles I was
assuming<00:00:20.730> that<00:00:21.330> it<00:00:21.600> had<00:00:21.720> dropped<00:00:21.930> a<00:00:22.109> valve<00:00:22.350> see

00:00:23.150 --> 00:00:23.160 
assuming that it had dropped a valve see

00:00:23.160 --> 00:00:26.150 
assuming that it had dropped a valve see
like<00:00:23.670> these<00:00:23.850> cars<00:00:24.060> normally<00:00:24.510> do<00:00:24.689> so<00:00:25.619> I<00:00:25.650> pulled

00:00:26.150 --> 00:00:26.160 
like these cars normally do so I pulled

00:00:26.160 --> 00:00:28.390 
like these cars normally do so I pulled
the<00:00:26.220> head<00:00:26.400> off<00:00:26.430> and<00:00:26.760> this<00:00:27.000> is<00:00:27.060> what<00:00:27.210> I<00:00:27.390> find

00:00:28.390 --> 00:00:28.400 
the head off and this is what I find

00:00:28.400 --> 00:00:32.060 
the head off and this is what I find
that<00:00:29.960> is<00:00:30.960> all<00:00:31.230> chewed<00:00:31.439> up<00:00:31.529> this<00:00:31.650> is<00:00:31.800> all<00:00:31.920> just

00:00:32.060 --> 00:00:32.070 
that is all chewed up this is all just

00:00:32.070 --> 00:00:34.729 
that is all chewed up this is all just
carbon<00:00:32.510> but<00:00:33.510> you<00:00:33.870> see<00:00:34.079> the<00:00:34.200> little<00:00:34.410> bits<00:00:34.620> that

00:00:34.729 --> 00:00:34.739 
carbon but you see the little bits that

00:00:34.739 --> 00:00:38.150 
carbon but you see the little bits that
stick<00:00:34.890> to<00:00:35.309> the<00:00:36.290> probe<00:00:37.290> whatever<00:00:37.920> you<00:00:37.980> want<00:00:38.100> to

00:00:38.150 --> 00:00:38.160 
stick to the probe whatever you want to

00:00:38.160 --> 00:00:42.229 
stick to the probe whatever you want to
call<00:00:38.280> it<00:00:38.899> that's<00:00:39.899> all<00:00:40.260> iron<00:00:40.850> or<00:00:41.850> whatever<00:00:42.149> they

00:00:42.229 --> 00:00:42.239 
call it that's all iron or whatever they

00:00:42.239 --> 00:00:45.610 
call it that's all iron or whatever they
use<00:00:42.360> for<00:00:42.570> valve<00:00:42.750> seats<00:00:43.020> nowadays<00:00:44.090> but<00:00:45.090> that's

00:00:45.610 --> 00:00:45.620 
use for valve seats nowadays but that's

00:00:45.620 --> 00:00:51.680 
use for valve seats nowadays but that's
pieces<00:00:46.620> of<00:00:46.739> the<00:00:46.800> valve<00:00:46.980> seat<00:00:47.250> right<00:00:47.489> there<00:00:50.690> so

00:00:51.680 --> 00:00:51.690 
pieces of the valve seat right there so

00:00:51.690 --> 00:00:53.540 
pieces of the valve seat right there so
it<00:00:51.870> chew<00:00:52.260> it<00:00:52.379> up<00:00:52.440> this<00:00:52.680> cylinder<00:00:53.010> pretty<00:00:53.340> good

00:00:53.540 --> 00:00:53.550 
it chew it up this cylinder pretty good

00:00:53.550 --> 00:00:56.029 
it chew it up this cylinder pretty good
this<00:00:54.270> piston<00:00:54.719> is<00:00:54.809> done<00:00:54.960> for<00:00:55.289> it's<00:00:55.860> got<00:00:56.010> a

00:00:56.029 --> 00:00:56.039 
this piston is done for it's got a

00:00:56.039 --> 00:00:58.700 
this piston is done for it's got a
little<00:00:56.309> bit<00:00:56.430> of<00:00:56.960> rough<00:00:57.960> stuff<00:00:58.230> right<00:00:58.440> there<00:00:58.620> on

00:00:58.700 --> 00:00:58.710 
little bit of rough stuff right there on

00:00:58.710 --> 00:00:59.990 
little bit of rough stuff right there on
the<00:00:58.800> cylinder<00:00:59.039> wall<00:00:59.309> but<00:00:59.550> I'm<00:00:59.699> going<00:00:59.820> to<00:00:59.850> try

00:00:59.990 --> 00:01:00.000 
the cylinder wall but I'm going to try

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:01.549 
the cylinder wall but I'm going to try
to<00:01:00.059> take<00:01:00.210> that<00:01:00.270> out<00:01:00.420> some<00:01:00.719> Emmerich<00:01:00.989> cloth

00:01:01.549 --> 00:01:01.559 
to take that out some Emmerich cloth

00:01:01.559 --> 00:01:05.090 
to take that out some Emmerich cloth
might<00:01:02.160> just<00:01:02.280> be<00:01:02.430> some<00:01:02.640> rust<00:01:02.910> in<00:01:03.510> this<00:01:04.439> one<00:01:04.680> I'm

00:01:05.090 --> 00:01:05.100 
might just be some rust in this one I'm

00:01:05.100 --> 00:01:09.740 
might just be some rust in this one I'm
just<00:01:05.309> reposition<00:01:05.760> my<00:01:05.850> light<00:01:08.180> see<00:01:09.180> this<00:01:09.570> one

00:01:09.740 --> 00:01:09.750 
just reposition my light see this one

00:01:09.750 --> 00:01:11.780 
just reposition my light see this one
right<00:01:09.930> here<00:01:10.260> the<00:01:11.130> valve<00:01:11.340> see<00:01:11.490> dropped

00:01:11.780 --> 00:01:11.790 
right here the valve see dropped

00:01:11.790 --> 00:01:14.480 
right here the valve see dropped
completely<00:01:11.970> pieces<00:01:12.750> fell<00:01:12.960> out<00:01:13.170> and<00:01:13.490> both

00:01:14.480 --> 00:01:14.490 
completely pieces fell out and both

00:01:14.490 --> 00:01:16.880 
completely pieces fell out and both
messed<00:01:14.790> everything<00:01:14.939> up<00:01:15.360> this<00:01:15.869> one<00:01:16.080> the<00:01:16.680> valve

00:01:16.880 --> 00:01:16.890 
messed everything up this one the valve

00:01:16.890 --> 00:01:18.170 
messed everything up this one the valve
seat<00:01:17.159> was<00:01:17.340> actually<00:01:17.580> starting<00:01:17.850> to<00:01:17.880> go<00:01:18.000> there's

00:01:18.170 --> 00:01:18.180 
seat was actually starting to go there's

00:01:18.180 --> 00:01:22.010 
seat was actually starting to go there's
a<00:01:18.240> lot<00:01:18.360> of<00:01:18.450> carbon<00:01:18.780> buildup<00:01:19.100> but<00:01:20.659> you<00:01:21.659> can<00:01:21.750> see

00:01:22.010 --> 00:01:22.020 
a lot of carbon buildup but you can see

00:01:22.020 --> 00:01:26.179 
a lot of carbon buildup but you can see
I<00:01:22.320> try<00:01:23.250> to<00:01:23.310> pull<00:01:23.759> one<00:01:23.790> on<00:01:24.060> top<00:01:25.040> there's<00:01:26.040> one

00:01:26.179 --> 00:01:26.189 
I try to pull one on top there's one

00:01:26.189 --> 00:01:29.390 
I try to pull one on top there's one
right<00:01:26.340> there<00:01:26.520> that<00:01:27.950> little<00:01:28.950> piece<00:01:29.280> right

00:01:29.390 --> 00:01:29.400 
right there that little piece right

00:01:29.400 --> 00:01:33.740 
right there that little piece right
there<00:01:30.740> isn't<00:01:31.740> carbon<00:01:32.100> that's<00:01:33.090> peaceful<00:01:33.420> valve

00:01:33.740 --> 00:01:33.750 
there isn't carbon that's peaceful valve

00:01:33.750 --> 00:01:39.020 
there isn't carbon that's peaceful valve
seat<00:01:34.020> or<00:01:34.890> at<00:01:35.009> least<00:01:35.189> aluminum<00:01:37.700> that's<00:01:38.700> another

00:01:39.020 --> 00:01:39.030 
seat or at least aluminum that's another

00:01:39.030 --> 00:01:42.050 
seat or at least aluminum that's another
one<00:01:39.240> right<00:01:39.450> there<00:01:39.479> so<00:01:39.990> this<00:01:40.770> valve<00:01:41.040> seat<00:01:41.310> was

00:01:42.050 --> 00:01:42.060 
one right there so this valve seat was

00:01:42.060 --> 00:01:44.300 
one right there so this valve seat was
starting<00:01:42.450> to<00:01:42.479> go<00:01:42.659> and<00:01:43.560> actually<00:01:43.710> you<00:01:44.040> can<00:01:44.159> tell

00:01:44.300 --> 00:01:44.310 
starting to go and actually you can tell

00:01:44.310 --> 00:01:47.530 
starting to go and actually you can tell
this<00:01:45.240> piston<00:01:45.600> got<00:01:45.780> chewed<00:01:46.049> up<00:01:46.170> quite<00:01:46.530> a<00:01:46.560> bit

00:01:47.530 --> 00:01:47.540 
this piston got chewed up quite a bit

00:01:47.540 --> 00:01:49.639 
this piston got chewed up quite a bit
this<00:01:48.540> one<00:01:48.720> it<00:01:48.810> was<00:01:48.899> all<00:01:49.020> just<00:01:49.200> in<00:01:49.320> this<00:01:49.439> valve

00:01:49.639 --> 00:01:49.649 
this one it was all just in this valve

00:01:49.649 --> 00:01:50.899 
this one it was all just in this valve
pocket<00:01:50.040> right<00:01:50.130> here<00:01:50.280> so<00:01:50.430> I'm<00:01:50.549> thinking<00:01:50.820> it

00:01:50.899 --> 00:01:50.909 
pocket right here so I'm thinking it

00:01:50.909 --> 00:01:54.950 
pocket right here so I'm thinking it
might<00:01:51.030> be<00:01:53.509> right<00:01:54.509> there

00:01:54.950 --> 00:01:54.960 
might be right there

00:01:54.960 --> 00:01:57.020 
might be right there
all<00:01:55.170> this<00:01:55.409> stuff<00:01:55.680> so<00:01:56.399> I'm<00:01:56.490> thinking<00:01:56.820> it<00:01:56.909> might

00:01:57.020 --> 00:01:57.030 
all this stuff so I'm thinking it might

00:01:57.030 --> 00:02:00.230 
all this stuff so I'm thinking it might
just<00:01:57.210> be<00:01:57.299> I<00:01:57.740> don't<00:01:58.740> know<00:01:58.890> a<00:01:59.189> lean<00:01:59.790> running<00:02:00.149> in

00:02:00.230 --> 00:02:00.240 
just be I don't know a lean running in

00:02:00.240 --> 00:02:02.539 
just be I don't know a lean running in
this<00:02:00.390> cylinder<00:02:00.689> but<00:02:00.960> the<00:02:01.530> other<00:02:01.680> one<00:02:01.829> I<00:02:02.070> can

00:02:02.539 --> 00:02:02.549 
this cylinder but the other one I can

00:02:02.549 --> 00:02:05.959 
this cylinder but the other one I can
guarantee<00:02:02.939> is<00:02:03.320> blue<00:02:04.320> bar<00:02:04.530> I<00:02:04.860> just<00:02:05.070> I<00:02:05.250> kick<00:02:05.850> up

00:02:05.959 --> 00:02:05.969 
guarantee is blue bar I just I kick up

00:02:05.969 --> 00:02:08.469 
guarantee is blue bar I just I kick up
tip<00:02:06.270> that<00:02:06.450> out<00:02:06.600> I<00:02:06.899> better<00:02:07.530> try

00:02:08.469 --> 00:02:08.479 
tip that out I better try

00:02:08.479 --> 00:02:14.320 
tip that out I better try
now<00:02:09.470> this<00:02:10.399> is<00:02:11.440> the<00:02:12.440> cylinder<00:02:12.709> head<00:02:13.239> so<00:02:14.239> you

00:02:14.320 --> 00:02:14.330 
now this is the cylinder head so you

00:02:14.330 --> 00:02:16.570 
now this is the cylinder head so you
have<00:02:14.420> to<00:02:14.540> remember<00:02:15.010> well<00:02:16.010> at<00:02:16.190> least<00:02:16.280> the<00:02:16.459> way<00:02:16.550> I

00:02:16.570 --> 00:02:16.580 
have to remember well at least the way I

00:02:16.580 --> 00:02:22.479 
have to remember well at least the way I
have<00:02:16.879> it<00:02:17.019> this<00:02:18.019> side<00:02:19.300> equals<00:02:20.300> this<00:02:20.450> side<00:02:21.489> this

00:02:22.479 --> 00:02:22.489 
have it this side equals this side this

00:02:22.489 --> 00:02:27.040 
have it this side equals this side this
one<00:02:23.230> is<00:02:24.230> the<00:02:24.500> major<00:02:24.680> damaged<00:02:25.160> one<00:02:25.900> and<00:02:26.900> all

00:02:27.040 --> 00:02:27.050 
one is the major damaged one and all

00:02:27.050 --> 00:02:29.290 
one is the major damaged one and all
this<00:02:27.200> queued<00:02:28.160> up<00:02:28.580> right<00:02:28.819> here

00:02:29.290 --> 00:02:29.300 
this queued up right here

00:02:29.300 --> 00:02:31.270 
this queued up right here
chunks<00:02:30.230> literally<00:02:30.680> taken<00:02:31.010> out<00:02:31.130> of<00:02:31.190> the

00:02:31.270 --> 00:02:31.280 
chunks literally taken out of the

chunks literally taken out of the
cylinder<00:02:31.519> head<00:02:32.170> that<00:02:33.170> actually<00:02:33.470> cut<00:02:33.860> right

00:02:34.509 --> 00:02:34.519 
cylinder head that actually cut right

00:02:34.519 --> 00:02:35.589 
cylinder head that actually cut right
it's<00:02:35.150> true

00:02:35.589 --> 00:02:35.599 
it's true

00:02:35.599 --> 00:02:40.270 
it's true
and<00:02:37.239> if<00:02:38.239> I<00:02:38.330> can<00:02:38.420> get<00:02:38.540> good<00:02:38.840> shot<00:02:39.110> of<00:02:39.140> this<00:02:39.410> can

00:02:40.270 --> 00:02:40.280 
and if I can get good shot of this can

00:02:40.280 --> 00:02:46.210 
and if I can get good shot of this can
actually<00:02:40.580> see<00:02:42.700> right<00:02:43.700> in<00:02:43.849> there<00:02:44.110> there's<00:02:45.220> not

00:02:46.210 --> 00:02:46.220 
actually see right in there there's not

00:02:46.220 --> 00:02:49.360 
actually see right in there there's not
a<00:02:46.280> consistent<00:02:46.880> line<00:02:47.420> so<00:02:48.349> a<00:02:48.380> little<00:02:48.709> bit<00:02:48.890> of<00:02:48.950> LC

00:02:49.360 --> 00:02:49.370 
a consistent line so a little bit of LC

00:02:49.370 --> 00:02:52.509 
a consistent line so a little bit of LC
fell<00:02:49.579> out<00:02:49.700> right<00:02:49.880> there<00:02:50.120> right<00:02:51.110> there<00:02:51.519> and

00:02:52.509 --> 00:02:52.519 
fell out right there right there and

00:02:52.519 --> 00:02:54.720 
fell out right there right there and
then<00:02:52.760> from<00:02:53.090> pretty<00:02:53.329> much<00:02:53.510> here<00:02:53.870> to<00:02:54.110> here<00:02:54.410> is

00:02:54.720 --> 00:02:54.730 
then from pretty much here to here is

00:02:54.730 --> 00:02:58.350 
then from pretty much here to here is
gone<00:02:55.730> completely<00:02:56.329> fell<00:02:56.959> out<00:02:57.110> of<00:02:57.140> the<00:02:57.290> head

00:02:58.350 --> 00:02:58.360 
gone completely fell out of the head

00:02:58.360 --> 00:03:00.520 
gone completely fell out of the head
haven't<00:02:59.360> check<00:02:59.510> the<00:02:59.630> exhaust<00:03:00.019> valve<00:03:00.319> yet

00:03:00.520 --> 00:03:00.530 
haven't check the exhaust valve yet

00:03:00.530 --> 00:03:01.600 
haven't check the exhaust valve yet
because<00:03:00.709> there's<00:03:00.860> more<00:03:01.010> overlap<00:03:01.400> but<00:03:01.519> it

00:03:01.600 --> 00:03:01.610 
because there's more overlap but it

00:03:01.610 --> 00:03:03.910 
because there's more overlap but it
looks<00:03:01.760> like<00:03:01.790> the<00:03:01.940> exhaust<00:03:02.180> valve<00:03:02.540> is<00:03:02.690> fine<00:03:02.920> all

00:03:03.910 --> 00:03:03.920 
looks like the exhaust valve is fine all

00:03:03.920 --> 00:03:07.960 
looks like the exhaust valve is fine all
the<00:03:03.980> damage<00:03:04.569> just<00:03:05.569> from<00:03:05.780> right<00:03:05.989> there<00:03:06.970> now

00:03:07.960 --> 00:03:07.970 
the damage just from right there now

00:03:07.970 --> 00:03:09.819 
the damage just from right there now
this<00:03:08.269> one<00:03:08.510> the<00:03:09.230> other<00:03:09.260> one<00:03:09.470> it<00:03:09.560> started<00:03:09.739> to

00:03:09.819 --> 00:03:09.829 
this one the other one it started to

00:03:09.829 --> 00:03:12.460 
this one the other one it started to
drop<00:03:09.950> a<00:03:10.010> valve<00:03:10.310> seat<00:03:10.549> I<00:03:10.810> can't<00:03:11.810> really<00:03:12.110> find

00:03:12.460 --> 00:03:12.470 
drop a valve seat I can't really find

00:03:12.470 --> 00:03:14.650 
drop a valve seat I can't really find
any<00:03:12.650> real<00:03:12.950> damage<00:03:13.190> to<00:03:13.519> the<00:03:13.579> valve<00:03:13.760> seat<00:03:14.060> simply

00:03:14.650 --> 00:03:14.660 
any real damage to the valve seat simply

00:03:14.660 --> 00:03:17.830 
any real damage to the valve seat simply
because<00:03:14.989> the<00:03:15.380> valve<00:03:15.859> covers<00:03:16.310> most<00:03:16.609> of<00:03:16.790> it<00:03:16.910> but

00:03:17.830 --> 00:03:17.840 
because the valve covers most of it but

00:03:17.840 --> 00:03:19.210 
because the valve covers most of it but
there's<00:03:18.049> a<00:03:18.109> little<00:03:18.230> bit<00:03:18.440> of<00:03:18.470> regularity<00:03:18.889> right

00:03:19.210 --> 00:03:19.220 
there's a little bit of regularity right

00:03:19.220 --> 00:03:22.809 
there's a little bit of regularity right
over<00:03:19.430> there<00:03:19.609> some<00:03:20.209> right<00:03:20.420> there<00:03:20.889> but<00:03:21.889> at<00:03:22.670> least

00:03:22.809 --> 00:03:22.819 
over there some right there but at least

00:03:22.819 --> 00:03:25.650 
over there some right there but at least
with<00:03:23.359> this<00:03:23.540> head<00:03:23.780> it<00:03:24.470> is<00:03:24.889> toast

00:03:25.650 --> 00:03:25.660 
with this head it is toast

00:03:25.660 --> 00:03:28.840 
with this head it is toast
y'all<00:03:26.660> like<00:03:26.750> need<00:03:26.900> to<00:03:26.930> do<00:03:27.079> from<00:03:27.200> here<00:03:27.500> is<00:03:27.850> to

y'all like need to do from here is to
buy<00:03:29.090> a<00:03:29.120> new<00:03:29.299> head<00:03:30.160> it's<00:03:31.160> going<00:03:31.280> to<00:03:31.340> need<00:03:31.489> two

00:03:31.690 --> 00:03:31.700 
buy a new head it's going to need two

00:03:31.700 --> 00:03:35.920 
buy a new head it's going to need two
new<00:03:31.850> Pistons<00:03:33.430> just<00:03:34.430> swap<00:03:34.700> everything<00:03:35.120> out<00:03:35.269> and

00:03:35.920 --> 00:03:35.930 
new Pistons just swap everything out and

00:03:35.930 --> 00:03:37.780 
new Pistons just swap everything out and
hopefully<00:03:36.410> this<00:03:36.530> car<00:03:36.739> lost<00:03:36.950> another<00:03:37.220> 80,000

00:03:37.780 --> 00:03:37.790 
hopefully this car lost another 80,000

00:03:37.790 --> 00:03:41.650 
hopefully this car lost another 80,000
miles<00:03:37.940> hopefully<00:03:39.670> but<00:03:40.670> this<00:03:41.090> is<00:03:41.239> what<00:03:41.329> happens

00:03:41.650 --> 00:03:41.660 
miles hopefully but this is what happens

00:03:41.660 --> 00:03:44.530 
miles hopefully but this is what happens
when<00:03:42.519> well<00:03:43.519> cars<00:03:44.060> just<00:03:44.269> aren't<00:03:44.450> designed

00:03:44.530 --> 00:03:44.540 
when well cars just aren't designed

00:03:44.540 --> 00:03:49.209 
when well cars just aren't designed
correctly<00:03:45.639> alright<00:03:46.639> that's<00:03:47.030> it
