 that you should not pass from one an equal 

00:00:39.149 --> 00:00:46.379
 an equal sign 0 x minus six f 

00:00:42.570 --> 00:00:49.440
 20 and close when we give 

00:00:46.379 --> 00:00:52.260
 a space writes its solid any 

00:00:49.440 --> 00:00:57.570

 I do not have this point here, it's not 

00:01:24.650 --> 00:01:29.369
 of the code but rather the case of my clan has 

00:01:27.750 --> 00:01:31.829
 a point so you do not boot do not need 

00:01:29.369 --> 00:01:33.299
 to put the point is not what the code will be 

00:01:31.829 --> 00:01:35.460

00:01:33.299 --> 00:01:38.070
