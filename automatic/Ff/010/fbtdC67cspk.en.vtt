copies<00:01:14.619> of<00:01:14.799> riser<00:01:15.159> and<00:01:15.670> i<00:01:16.570> started<00:01:16.990> thinking

00:01:17.039 --> 00:01:17.049 
copies of riser and i started thinking

00:01:17.049 --> 00:01:19.140 
copies of riser and i started thinking
about<00:01:17.470> that<00:01:17.710> and<00:01:17.860> just<00:01:17.920> doing<00:01:18.250> some<00:01:18.430> video<00:01:18.850> and

00:01:19.140 --> 00:01:19.150 
about that and just doing some video and

00:01:19.150 --> 00:01:22.020 
about that and just doing some video and
I<00:01:19.210> was<00:01:19.299> like<00:01:19.890> Rises<00:01:20.890> really<00:01:21.310> mediocre<00:01:21.520> this

00:01:22.020 --> 00:01:22.030 
I was like Rises really mediocre this

00:01:22.030 --> 00:01:24.149 
I was like Rises really mediocre this
format<00:01:22.360> even<00:01:22.540> said<00:01:22.840> in<00:01:22.930> the<00:01:23.020> video<00:01:23.320> that<00:01:23.740> you

00:01:24.149 --> 00:01:24.159 
format even said in the video that you

00:01:24.159 --> 00:01:26.340 
format even said in the video that you
know<00:01:24.640> Raisa<00:01:24.939> isn't<00:01:25.450> very<00:01:25.630> good<00:01:25.720> against<00:01:26.080> more

00:01:26.340 --> 00:01:26.350 
know Raisa isn't very good against more

00:01:26.350 --> 00:01:27.749 
know Raisa isn't very good against more
males<00:01:26.560> and<00:01:26.770> I<00:01:26.830> was<00:01:26.979> like<00:01:27.159> well<00:01:27.520> I<00:01:27.549> could

00:01:27.749 --> 00:01:27.759 
males and I was like well I could

00:01:27.759 --> 00:01:30.060 
males and I was like well I could
definitely<00:01:28.000> can<00:01:28.479> see<00:01:28.659> that<00:01:28.869> but<00:01:29.110> why<00:01:29.710> playing

00:01:30.060 --> 00:01:30.070 
definitely can see that but why playing

00:01:30.070 --> 00:01:31.890 
definitely can see that but why playing
a<00:01:30.130> card<00:01:30.340> that's<00:01:30.549> not<00:01:30.759> really<00:01:31.299> good<00:01:31.570> against

00:01:31.890 --> 00:01:31.900 
a card that's not really good against

00:01:31.900 --> 00:01:33.710 
a card that's not really good against
the<00:01:32.200> best<00:01:32.380> deck<00:01:32.590> of<00:01:32.710> the<00:01:32.770> format<00:01:33.100> alright<00:01:33.400> so

00:01:33.710 --> 00:01:33.720 
the best deck of the format alright so

00:01:33.720 --> 00:01:35.880 
the best deck of the format alright so
here<00:01:34.720> are<00:01:34.810> some<00:01:34.930> of<00:01:35.049> the<00:01:35.110> reasons<00:01:35.259> why<00:01:35.530> I<00:01:35.650> think

00:01:35.880 --> 00:01:35.890 
here are some of the reasons why I think

00:01:35.890 --> 00:01:38.160 
here are some of the reasons why I think
their<00:01:36.310> solos<00:01:36.640> is<00:01:36.820> a<00:01:36.850> really<00:01:37.210> strong<00:01:37.450> card<00:01:37.720> so

00:01:38.160 --> 00:01:38.170 
their solos is a really strong card so

00:01:38.170 --> 00:01:39.929 
their solos is a really strong card so
first<00:01:38.470> off<00:01:38.680> one<00:01:38.890> of<00:01:38.920> the<00:01:39.070> reasons<00:01:39.400> I<00:01:39.579> really

00:01:39.929 --> 00:01:39.939 
first off one of the reasons I really

00:01:39.939 --> 00:01:42.300 
first off one of the reasons I really
like<00:01:40.299> best<00:01:40.570> ILO's<00:01:40.960> is<00:01:41.170> because<00:01:41.560> he<00:01:42.100> can

00:01:42.300 --> 00:01:42.310 
like best ILO's is because he can

00:01:42.310 --> 00:01:45.060 
like best ILO's is because he can
counter<00:01:42.790> a<00:01:43.000> very<00:01:43.630> common<00:01:44.200> tactic<00:01:44.680> that's<00:01:44.860> been

00:01:45.060 --> 00:01:45.070 
counter a very common tactic that's been

00:01:45.070 --> 00:01:47.399 
counter a very common tactic that's been
used<00:01:45.340> and<00:01:45.670> employed<00:01:45.970> against<00:01:46.420> frog<00:01:47.049> monarch

00:01:47.399 --> 00:01:47.409 
used and employed against frog monarch

00:01:47.409 --> 00:01:49.380 
used and employed against frog monarch
players<00:01:47.619> for<00:01:47.920> ages<00:01:48.340> and<00:01:48.490> that's<00:01:48.909> simply<00:01:49.149> to

00:01:49.380 --> 00:01:49.390 
players for ages and that's simply to

00:01:49.390 --> 00:01:51.600 
players for ages and that's simply to
not<00:01:49.659> invest<00:01:49.960> any<00:01:50.290> cards<00:01:50.680> on<00:01:50.770> the<00:01:50.860> board<00:01:51.040> until

00:01:51.600 --> 00:01:51.610 
not invest any cards on the board until

00:01:51.610 --> 00:01:53.280 
not invest any cards on the board until
you<00:01:51.729> feel<00:01:51.909> like<00:01:52.030> you<00:01:52.149> can<00:01:52.329> set<00:01:52.570> up<00:01:52.600> an<00:01:52.840> adequate

00:01:53.280 --> 00:01:53.290 
you feel like you can set up an adequate

00:01:53.290 --> 00:01:55.289 
you feel like you can set up an adequate
defense<00:01:53.740> when<00:01:54.280> people<00:01:54.610> see<00:01:54.759> that<00:01:54.909> you<00:01:55.030> dumped

00:02:58.940 --> 00:02:58.950 
two level three those are common in the

00:02:58.950 --> 00:03:00.980 
two level three those are common in the
deck<00:02:59.160> so<00:02:59.370> maybe<00:02:59.580> you're<00:02:59.700> only<00:02:59.760> doing<00:02:59.970> for<00:03:00.330> 600

00:03:00.980 --> 00:03:00.990

deck so maybe you're only doing for 600
or<00:03:01.080> whatever<00:03:01.350> but<00:03:01.860> you<00:03:02.100> never<00:03:02.400> know<00:03:02.670> when<00:03:03.060> you

or whatever but you never know when you
might<00:03:03.300> end<00:03:03.540> up<00:03:03.690> hitting<00:03:03.930> that<00:03:04.140> goal<00:03:04.500> or

00:03:04.880 --> 00:03:04.890 
might end up hitting that goal or

00:03:04.890 --> 00:03:06.410 
might end up hitting that goal or
hitting<00:03:05.130> that<00:03:05.310> abyss<00:03:05.610> mega<00:03:05.940> low<00:03:06.120> or<00:03:06.300> something

like that and just randomly ending the

00:03:08.010 --> 00:03:10.100 
like that and just randomly ending the
game<00:03:08.160> so<00:03:08.730> much<00:03:08.940> like<00:03:09.180> Caius<00:03:09.570> I<00:03:09.720> just<00:03:09.900> like<00:03:09.990> the

00:03:10.100 --> 00:03:10.110 
game so much like Caius I just like the

00:03:10.110 --> 00:03:12.170 
game so much like Caius I just like the
fact<00:03:10.290> that<00:03:10.440> you<00:03:11.010> know<00:03:11.160> the<00:03:11.490> potential<00:03:12.030> of

00:03:13.760 --> 00:03:13.770 
winning in main phase two is always

00:03:13.770 --> 00:03:16.010 
winning in main phase two is always
there<00:03:14.190> thestalos<00:03:14.790> is<00:03:15.180> also<00:03:15.450> a<00:03:15.480> far<00:03:15.840> better

00:03:16.010 --> 00:03:16.020 
there thestalos is also a far better

00:03:16.020 --> 00:03:18.080 
there thestalos is also a far better

00:04:54.010 --> 00:04:54.020 
take a couple of examples let's say your

00:04:54.020 --> 00:04:56.020 
take a couple of examples let's say your
opponent<00:04:54.409> has<00:04:54.500> a<00:04:54.530> field<00:04:54.830> of<00:04:54.979> bear<00:04:55.430> and<00:04:55.669> Tinky

right<00:04:56.270> rice<00:04:56.930> is<00:04:57.110> pretty<00:04:57.229> much<00:04:57.500> useless<00:04:57.830> unless

00:04:58.149 --> 00:04:58.159 
right rice is pretty much useless unless

00:04:58.159 --> 00:05:00.580 
right rice is pretty much useless unless
you're<00:04:58.430> going<00:04:58.580> for<00:04:58.699> game<00:04:59.000> because<00:04:59.810> if<00:05:00.349> you

00:05:00.580 --> 00:05:00.590 
you're going for game because if you

00:05:00.590 --> 00:05:02.860 
you're going for game because if you
spin<00:05:00.889> the<00:05:01.039> baler<00:05:01.310> okay<00:05:02.120> you<00:05:02.180> can<00:05:02.419> attack<00:05:02.689> for

00:05:02.860 --> 00:05:02.870

00:05:04.480 --> 00:05:04.490 
24 and that's great and everything but

00:05:04.490 --> 00:05:06.159 
24 and that's great and everything but
next<00:05:04.669> turn<00:05:05.090> your<00:05:05.330> opponent<00:05:05.659> just<00:05:05.750> summons<00:05:06.080> the
