00:00:01.030 --> 00:00:07.809
 now it was not said that Rodriguez that 

00:00:03.370 --> 00:00:09.639
 we are in an audi or similar that this 

00:00:07.809 --> 00:00:13.839
 is part 2 of the game collection 

00:00:09.639 --> 00:00:16.840
 what I did and I guess like a ticket and 

00:00:13.839 --> 00:00:18.790
 The collection will already be available in the collection 

00:00:16.840 --> 00:00:20.830
 first video made the first part 

00:00:18.790 --> 00:00:23.380
 had more reproductions than the second 

00:00:20.830 --> 00:00:26.530
 so I guess the first hour 

00:00:23.380 --> 00:00:30.220
 had more and good 

00:00:26.530 --> 00:00:34.420
 we do it with hello 4 

00:00:30.220 --> 00:00:37.449
 04 is a great bachelor 

00:00:34.420 --> 00:00:40.859
 then I more or less understand themes 

00:00:37.449 --> 00:00:42.909
 originals in one of the best online 

00:00:40.859 --> 00:00:45.609
 although what I do not like is that it is 

00:00:42.909 --> 00:00:48.129
 drive the boxes and all that in 

00:00:45.609 --> 00:00:49.720
 third person should drive in 

00:00:48.129 --> 00:00:53.440
 first 

00:00:49.720 --> 00:00:57.630
 and I where first if it is an organism 

00:00:53.440 --> 00:00:57.630
 fire that yes no 

00:00:58.590 --> 00:01:01.760
 even if it is one 

00:01:03.339 --> 00:01:11.530
 the secret is this game is a game 

00:01:07.060 --> 00:01:15.800
 this game is a great game so I'm telling you 

00:01:11.530 --> 00:01:20.550
 this you play with a great story and of 

00:01:15.800 --> 00:01:24.000
 asked what was he going 

00:01:20.550 --> 00:01:28.430
 and what they kidnap you 

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:32.810
 and in this kidnapping 

00:01:28.430 --> 00:01:39.080
 people want to keep hunting eating 

00:01:32.810 --> 00:01:43.190
 and in the end you have to choose one but with 

00:01:39.080 --> 00:01:43.190
 the bad option but 

00:01:45.930 --> 00:01:48.710
 we arrived with 

00:01:50.630 --> 00:01:58.800
 satisfied that is to say he is the only one 

00:01:55.380 --> 00:02:01.710
 I have but it's a good game I like 

00:01:58.800 --> 00:02:03.860

00:02:03.860 --> 00:02:07.760
 regarding the campaign 

00:02:08.979 --> 00:02:14.530
 this puts you is leaving the area of 

00:02:12.200 --> 00:02:14.530
 combat 

00:02:15.260 --> 00:02:23.110
 what I do not like about the time to buy 

00:02:19.190 --> 00:02:25.510
 but 

00:02:23.110 --> 00:02:31.470
 the future 

00:02:25.510 --> 00:02:31.470
 224 we could war 2 

00:02:35.980 --> 00:02:38.980

00:02:42.080 --> 00:02:46.610

00:02:58.510 --> 00:03:01.980
 for the time that was 2007 

00:03:04.080 --> 00:03:11.340

 i 

00:03:22.330 --> 00:03:29.180

00:03:26.710 --> 00:03:32.379

00:03:43.640 --> 00:03:49.050
 reason for how much color a great 

00:03:46.380 --> 00:03:54.950
