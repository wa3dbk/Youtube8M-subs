fresh and fun and see if I can do well
with<00:00:12.929> these<00:00:13.200> crazy<00:00:13.830> suggestions<00:00:14.639> and<00:00:14.849> this

00:00:15.589 --> 00:00:15.599 
with these crazy suggestions and this

00:00:15.599 --> 00:00:17.890 
with these crazy suggestions and this
time<00:00:15.900> a<00:00:16.109> bunch<00:00:16.320> of<00:00:16.470> you<00:00:16.560> wanted<00:00:16.920> me<00:00:17.039> to<00:00:17.160> use<00:00:17.369> the

00:00:17.890 --> 00:00:17.900 
time a bunch of you wanted me to use the

00:00:17.900 --> 00:00:21.349 
time a bunch of you wanted me to use the
an-94<00:00:18.900> with<00:00:19.410> the<00:00:19.590> suppressor<00:00:20.039> for<00:00:20.820> grip<00:00:21.119> and

00:00:21.349 --> 00:00:21.359 
an-94 with the suppressor for grip and

00:00:21.359 --> 00:00:24.500 
an-94 with the suppressor for grip and
seven<00:00:22.140> times<00:00:22.500> optic<00:00:23.279> scope<00:00:23.670> and<00:00:23.910> the<00:00:24.269> real

00:00:24.500 --> 00:00:24.510 
seven times optic scope and the real

00:00:24.510 --> 00:00:26.210 
seven times optic scope and the real
kicker<00:00:24.810> on<00:00:25.050> it<00:00:25.170> is<00:00:25.289> that<00:00:25.439> it<00:00:25.529> also<00:00:25.710> needed<00:00:26.189> to

00:00:26.210 --> 00:00:26.220 
kicker on it is that it also needed to

00:00:26.220 --> 00:00:28.519 
kicker on it is that it also needed to
be<00:00:26.400> in<00:00:26.640> full<00:00:27.000> auto<00:00:27.420> mode<00:00:27.599> and<00:00:27.990> as<00:00:28.080> you<00:00:28.320> guys<00:00:28.500> are

00:00:28.519 --> 00:00:28.529 
be in full auto mode and as you guys are

00:00:28.529 --> 00:00:31.580 
be in full auto mode and as you guys are
probably<00:00:28.830> very<00:00:29.279> familiar<00:00:29.460> the<00:00:30.119> an-94<00:00:31.109> s<00:00:31.320> main

00:00:31.580 --> 00:00:31.590 
probably very familiar the an-94 s main

00:00:31.590 --> 00:00:33.380 
probably very familiar the an-94 s main
benefit<00:00:32.099> of<00:00:32.130> it<00:00:32.369> is<00:00:32.489> the<00:00:33.030> burst<00:00:33.239> fire

00:00:33.380 --> 00:00:33.390 
benefit of it is the burst fire

00:00:33.390 --> 00:00:36.470 
benefit of it is the burst fire
capabilities<00:00:34.290> if<00:00:34.469> your<00:00:34.980> able<00:00:35.460> to<00:00:35.640> maximize<00:00:36.120> it

00:00:36.470 --> 00:00:36.480 
capabilities if your able to maximize it

00:00:36.480 --> 00:00:38.360 
capabilities if your able to maximize it
you<00:00:36.570> probably<00:00:36.899> can't<00:00:37.350> do<00:00:37.559> it<00:00:37.710> no<00:00:37.860> one<00:00:37.890> is<00:00:38.190> that

00:00:38.360 --> 00:00:38.370 
you probably can't do it no one is that

00:00:38.370 --> 00:00:40.520 
you probably can't do it no one is that
perfect<00:00:38.790> but<00:00:38.850> if<00:00:38.940> you're<00:00:39.059> able<00:00:39.329> to<00:00:39.530> maximize

00:00:40.520 --> 00:00:40.530 
perfect but if you're able to maximize

00:00:40.530 --> 00:00:43.220 
perfect but if you're able to maximize
the<00:00:41.160> burst<00:00:41.370> fire<00:00:41.520> potential<00:00:42.059> on<00:00:42.360> this<00:00:42.540> gun<00:00:42.750> you

00:00:43.220 --> 00:00:43.230 
the burst fire potential on this gun you

00:00:43.230 --> 00:00:46.190 
the burst fire potential on this gun you
can<00:00:43.379> get<00:00:43.500> it<00:00:43.620> to<00:00:44.120> 1,200<00:00:45.120> rounds<00:00:45.390> per<00:00:45.899> minute

00:00:46.190 --> 00:00:46.200 
can get it to 1,200 rounds per minute

00:00:46.200 --> 00:00:48.680 
can get it to 1,200 rounds per minute
which<00:00:46.350> is<00:00:46.379> insane<00:00:47.340> and<00:00:47.700> just<00:00:48.000> one<00:00:48.300> of<00:00:48.420> the<00:00:48.510> main

00:00:48.680 --> 00:00:48.690 
which is insane and just one of the main

00:00:48.690 --> 00:00:51.799 
which is insane and just one of the main
benefits<00:00:49.469> of<00:00:49.890> it<00:00:50.100> and<00:00:50.340> I<00:00:50.760> know<00:00:50.820> exactly<00:00:51.059> what

00:00:51.799 --> 00:00:51.809 
benefits of it and I know exactly what

00:00:51.809 --> 00:00:53.959 
benefits of it and I know exactly what
this<00:00:51.960> suggestion<00:00:52.379> was<00:00:52.770> attempting<00:00:53.430> to<00:00:53.460> do<00:00:53.760> it

00:00:53.959 --> 00:00:53.969 
this suggestion was attempting to do it

00:00:53.969 --> 00:00:56.209 
this suggestion was attempting to do it
was<00:00:54.059> attempting<00:00:54.510> to<00:00:54.629> make<00:00:54.840> the<00:00:55.020> an-94<00:00:56.010> which

00:00:56.209 --> 00:00:56.219 
was attempting to make the an-94 which

00:00:56.219 --> 00:00:59.270 
was attempting to make the an-94 which
is<00:00:56.370> a<00:00:56.399> long-range<00:00:57.149> accurate<00:00:57.960> skillful<00:00:58.829> weapon

00:00:59.270 --> 00:00:59.280 
is a long-range accurate skillful weapon

00:00:59.280 --> 00:01:02.450 
is a long-range accurate skillful weapon
and<00:00:59.840> reducing<00:01:00.840> that<00:01:01.260> that<00:01:01.829> killing<00:01:02.160> potential

00:01:02.450 --> 00:01:02.460 
and reducing that that killing potential

00:01:02.460 --> 00:01:05.479 
and reducing that that killing potential
by<00:01:02.760> using<00:01:03.030> the<00:01:03.300> suppressor<00:01:03.930> and<00:01:04.140> the<00:01:05.010> foregrip

00:01:05.479 --> 00:01:05.489 
by using the suppressor and the foregrip

00:01:05.489 --> 00:01:07.130 
by using the suppressor and the foregrip
the<00:01:05.670> seven<00:01:05.970> times<00:01:06.180> scope<00:01:06.570> I<00:01:06.689> think<00:01:06.869> was<00:01:06.990> just

00:01:07.130 --> 00:01:07.140 
the seven times scope I think was just

00:01:07.140 --> 00:01:08.660 
the seven times scope I think was just
meant<00:01:07.320> to<00:01:07.380> be<00:01:07.470> kind<00:01:07.890> of<00:01:08.010> a<00:01:08.100> nuisance<00:01:08.460> because

00:01:08.660 --> 00:01:08.670 
meant to be kind of a nuisance because

00:01:08.670 --> 00:01:11.060 
meant to be kind of a nuisance because
the<00:01:09.390> higher<00:01:09.689> optic<00:01:10.110> scopes<00:01:10.380> can<00:01:10.530> be<00:01:10.710> a<00:01:10.740> little

00:01:11.060 --> 00:01:11.070 
the higher optic scopes can be a little

00:01:11.070 --> 00:01:12.590 
the higher optic scopes can be a little
bit<00:01:11.159> harder<00:01:11.430> to<00:01:11.520> handle<00:01:11.670> when<00:01:12.000> you<00:01:12.150> are<00:01:12.330> using

00:01:12.590 --> 00:01:12.600 
bit harder to handle when you are using

00:01:12.600 --> 00:01:15.679 
bit harder to handle when you are using
a<00:01:12.869> fully<00:01:13.200> automatic<00:01:13.740> weapon<00:01:14.280> and<00:01:14.400> so<00:01:15.000> going

00:01:15.679 --> 00:01:15.689 
a fully automatic weapon and so going

00:01:15.689 --> 00:01:18.679 
a fully automatic weapon and so going
into<00:01:16.049> this<00:01:16.200> I<00:01:16.409> wasn't<00:01:17.009> exactly<00:01:17.430> sure<00:01:17.700> what<00:01:18.420> to

00:01:18.679 --> 00:01:18.689 
into this I wasn't exactly sure what to

00:01:18.689 --> 00:01:22.100 
into this I wasn't exactly sure what to
expect<00:01:19.409> but<00:01:19.920> in<00:01:20.130> all<00:01:20.280> honesty<00:01:20.790> I<00:01:21.030> actually<00:01:21.720> had

00:01:22.100 --> 00:01:22.110 
expect but in all honesty I actually had

00:01:22.110 --> 00:01:24.380 
expect but in all honesty I actually had
a<00:01:22.140> lot<00:01:22.619> of<00:01:22.830> fun<00:01:23.070> with<00:01:23.369> this<00:01:23.549> challenge<00:01:24.000> I<00:01:24.090> mean

00:01:24.380 --> 00:01:24.390 
a lot of fun with this challenge I mean

00:01:24.390 --> 00:01:26.630 
a lot of fun with this challenge I mean
it<00:01:24.540> wasn't<00:01:24.689> a<00:01:24.810> cakewalk<00:01:25.080> by<00:01:25.500> any<00:01:25.680> means<00:01:25.950> but<00:01:26.189> I

00:01:26.630 --> 00:01:26.640 
it wasn't a cakewalk by any means but I

00:01:26.640 --> 00:01:29.330 
it wasn't a cakewalk by any means but I
was<00:01:27.090> fairly<00:01:28.049> successful<00:01:28.470> with<00:01:29.040> it<00:01:29.189> and<00:01:29.310> I

00:01:29.330 --> 00:01:29.340 
was fairly successful with it and I

00:01:29.340 --> 00:01:32.420 
was fairly successful with it and I
think<00:01:29.549> it's<00:01:29.700> because<00:01:30.090> the<00:01:30.600> full<00:01:31.380> auto<00:01:31.680> on<00:01:32.189> the

00:01:32.420 --> 00:01:32.430 
think it's because the full auto on the

00:01:32.430 --> 00:01:35.030 
think it's because the full auto on the
gun<00:01:32.640> isn't<00:01:33.390> as<00:01:33.509> bad<00:01:33.780> as<00:01:34.049> a<00:01:34.079> lot<00:01:34.229> of<00:01:34.619> people

00:01:35.030 --> 00:01:35.040 
gun isn't as bad as a lot of people

00:01:35.040 --> 00:01:37.310 
gun isn't as bad as a lot of people
think<00:01:35.430> it<00:01:35.549> is<00:01:35.640> because<00:01:36.060> the<00:01:36.540> first<00:01:36.750> two<00:01:37.020> shots

00:01:37.310 --> 00:01:37.320 
think it is because the first two shots

00:01:37.320 --> 00:01:39.109 
think it is because the first two shots
I<00:01:37.590> could<00:01:37.979> be<00:01:38.100> completely<00:01:38.250> wrong<00:01:38.520> and<00:01:38.880> I'm<00:01:38.939> sure

00:01:39.109 --> 00:01:39.119 
I could be completely wrong and I'm sure

00:01:39.119 --> 00:01:40.730 
I could be completely wrong and I'm sure

even though I am using this in full auto

00:01:45.509 --> 00:01:48.590 
even though I am using this in full auto
those<00:01:46.290> first<00:01:46.680> two<00:01:46.979> shots<00:01:47.369> still<00:01:48.149> get<00:01:48.479> the

00:01:48.590 --> 00:01:48.600 
those first two shots still get the

00:01:48.600 --> 00:01:50.960 
those first two shots still get the
benefit<00:01:49.079> as<00:01:49.229> if<00:01:49.439> I<00:01:49.560> was<00:01:49.740> using<00:01:49.920> this<00:01:50.280> in<00:01:50.520> the

00:01:50.960 --> 00:01:50.970 
benefit as if I was using this in the

00:01:50.970 --> 00:01:52.639 
benefit as if I was using this in the
burst<00:01:51.210> fire<00:01:51.509> mode<00:01:51.540> they<00:01:51.840> travel<00:01:52.320> extremely

00:01:52.639 --> 00:01:52.649 
burst fire mode they travel extremely

00:01:52.649 --> 00:01:55.789 
burst fire mode they travel extremely
fast<00:01:53.250> out<00:01:53.460> of<00:01:53.520> the<00:01:53.700> an-94<00:01:54.630> and<00:01:54.899> the<00:01:55.439> reason<00:01:55.710> why

00:01:55.789 --> 00:01:55.799 
fast out of the an-94 and the reason why

00:01:55.799 --> 00:01:57.770 
fast out of the an-94 and the reason why
I<00:01:55.829> say<00:01:56.159> this<00:01:56.340> is<00:01:56.490> because<00:01:56.520> when<00:01:57.360> I<00:01:57.390> was<00:01:57.570> getting

00:01:57.770 --> 00:01:57.780 
I say this is because when I was getting

00:01:57.780 --> 00:02:00.200 
I say this is because when I was getting
in<00:01:57.899> firefights<00:01:58.409> with<00:01:58.500> players<00:01:58.860> on<00:01:59.189> paper<00:01:59.850> this

00:02:00.200 --> 00:02:00.210 
in firefights with players on paper this

00:02:00.210 --> 00:02:02.030 
in firefights with players on paper this
weapon<00:02:00.600> doesn't<00:02:00.780> have<00:02:00.990> a<00:02:01.020> very<00:02:01.290> fast<00:02:01.560> rounds

00:02:02.030 --> 00:02:02.040 
weapon doesn't have a very fast rounds

00:02:02.040 --> 00:02:04.580 
weapon doesn't have a very fast rounds
per<00:02:02.159> minute<00:02:02.280> only<00:02:02.579> has<00:02:02.729> an<00:02:02.850> RPM<00:02:03.360> of<00:02:03.630> 600<00:02:04.469> which

00:02:04.580 --> 00:02:04.590 
per minute only has an RPM of 600 which

00:02:04.590 --> 00:02:07.100 
per minute only has an RPM of 600 which
is<00:02:04.740> really<00:02:05.369> really<00:02:05.579> slow<00:02:06.119> and<00:02:06.390> it<00:02:06.869> doesn't

00:02:07.100 --> 00:02:07.110 
is really really slow and it doesn't

00:02:07.110 --> 00:02:09.290 
is really really slow and it doesn't
have<00:02:07.290> a<00:02:07.530> higher<00:02:07.799> damage<00:02:08.129> model<00:02:08.610> than<00:02:08.879> all<00:02:09.119> of

00:02:09.290 --> 00:02:09.300 
have a higher damage model than all of

00:02:09.300 --> 00:02:10.580 
have a higher damage model than all of
the<00:02:09.390> other<00:02:09.509> assault<00:02:09.899> rifles<00:02:09.929> out<00:02:10.319> there<00:02:10.560> I

00:02:10.580 --> 00:02:10.590 
the other assault rifles out there I

00:02:10.590 --> 00:02:11.990 
the other assault rifles out there I
mean<00:02:10.679> it's<00:02:10.800> gonna<00:02:10.920> do<00:02:11.039> 25<00:02:11.459> damage<00:02:11.700> up<00:02:11.970> close

00:02:11.990 --> 00:02:12.000 
mean it's gonna do 25 damage up close

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:13.460 
mean it's gonna do 25 damage up close
very<00:02:12.900> standard

00:02:13.460 --> 00:02:13.470 
very standard

00:02:13.470 --> 00:02:16.100 
very standard
all<00:02:13.830> around<00:02:14.280> and<00:02:14.670> I<00:02:15.300> was<00:02:15.450> still<00:02:15.690> dropping

00:02:16.100 --> 00:02:16.110 
all around and I was still dropping

00:02:16.110 --> 00:02:18.800 
all around and I was still dropping
people<00:02:16.470> extremely<00:02:17.370> quickly<00:02:17.880> and<00:02:18.030> I<00:02:18.480> came<00:02:18.690> to

00:02:18.800 --> 00:02:18.810 
people extremely quickly and I came to

00:02:18.810 --> 00:02:20.630 
people extremely quickly and I came to
the<00:02:18.900> conclusion<00:02:18.990> is<00:02:19.560> that<00:02:19.590> just<00:02:20.130> those<00:02:20.310> first

00:02:20.630 --> 00:02:20.640 
the conclusion is that just those first

00:02:20.640 --> 00:02:22.490 
the conclusion is that just those first
two<00:02:20.940> bullets<00:02:21.390> as<00:02:21.510> long<00:02:22.050> as<00:02:22.200> you're<00:02:22.320> accurate

00:02:22.490 --> 00:02:22.500 
two bullets as long as you're accurate

00:02:22.500 --> 00:02:25.580 
two bullets as long as you're accurate
with<00:02:22.860> it<00:02:22.890> they<00:02:23.700> travel<00:02:24.300> out<00:02:24.390> of<00:02:24.450> the<00:02:24.570> an-94<00:02:25.350> a

00:02:25.580 --> 00:02:25.590 
with it they travel out of the an-94 a

00:02:25.590 --> 00:02:27.950 
with it they travel out of the an-94 a
lot<00:02:25.920> faster<00:02:26.490> than<00:02:26.640> 600<00:02:27.210> rounds<00:02:27.330> per<00:02:27.540> minute

00:02:27.950 --> 00:02:27.960 
lot faster than 600 rounds per minute

00:02:27.960 --> 00:02:29.930 
lot faster than 600 rounds per minute
you<00:02:28.140> get<00:02:28.290> that<00:02:28.440> benefit<00:02:28.950> and<00:02:29.160> as<00:02:29.550> long<00:02:29.730> as<00:02:29.850> you

00:02:29.930 --> 00:02:29.940 
you get that benefit and as long as you

00:02:29.940 --> 00:02:32.000 
you get that benefit and as long as you
kind<00:02:30.060> of<00:02:30.180> tap<00:02:30.390> fire<00:02:30.690> or<00:02:30.990> even<00:02:31.470> just<00:02:31.710> go<00:02:31.830> full

00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:32.010 
kind of tap fire or even just go full

00:02:32.010 --> 00:02:34.610 
kind of tap fire or even just go full
auto<00:02:32.070> from<00:02:32.880> then<00:02:33.120> on<00:02:33.270> it<00:02:33.450> out<00:02:33.690> you<00:02:34.260> are<00:02:34.440> gonna

00:02:34.610 --> 00:02:34.620 
auto from then on it out you are gonna

00:02:34.620 --> 00:02:37.310 
auto from then on it out you are gonna
drop<00:02:34.920> people<00:02:35.280> extremely<00:02:36.180> quickly<00:02:36.480> but<00:02:37.140> don't

00:02:37.310 --> 00:02:37.320 
drop people extremely quickly but don't

00:02:37.320 --> 00:02:39.500 
drop people extremely quickly but don't
get<00:02:37.440> me<00:02:37.590> wrong<00:02:37.620> this<00:02:38.040> setup<00:02:38.430> was<00:02:38.670> still<00:02:39.030> pretty

00:02:39.500 --> 00:02:39.510 
get me wrong this setup was still pretty

00:02:39.510 --> 00:02:41.540 
get me wrong this setup was still pretty
painful<00:02:40.020> I<00:02:40.050> mean<00:02:40.080> this<00:02:40.680> combination<00:02:41.400> of

00:02:41.540 --> 00:02:41.550 
painful I mean this combination of

00:02:41.550 --> 00:02:43.940 
painful I mean this combination of
attachments<00:02:42.180> is<00:02:42.300> not<00:02:42.570> good<00:02:42.840> for<00:02:42.870> the<00:02:43.140> an-94

00:02:43.940 --> 00:02:43.950 
attachments is not good for the an-94

00:02:43.950 --> 00:02:46.280 
attachments is not good for the an-94
and<00:02:44.190> one<00:02:44.730> of<00:02:44.820> the<00:02:44.880> larger<00:02:45.270> hindrance<00:02:45.690> was<00:02:45.930> just

00:02:46.280 --> 00:02:46.290 
and one of the larger hindrance was just

00:02:46.290 --> 00:02:47.960 
and one of the larger hindrance was just
the<00:02:46.440> suppressor<00:02:46.980> itself<00:02:47.430> and<00:02:47.610> you<00:02:47.670> guys<00:02:47.790> know

00:02:47.960 --> 00:02:47.970 
the suppressor itself and you guys know

00:02:47.970 --> 00:02:50.090 
the suppressor itself and you guys know
me<00:02:48.120> I<00:02:48.150> love<00:02:48.630> the<00:02:48.810> suppressor<00:02:49.290> I<00:02:49.320> mean<00:02:49.530> staying

00:02:50.090 --> 00:02:50.100 
me I love the suppressor I mean staying

00:02:50.100 --> 00:02:52.010 
me I love the suppressor I mean staying
off<00:02:50.310> the<00:02:50.430> mini-map<00:02:50.760> is<00:02:50.970> amazing<00:02:51.570> in<00:02:51.720> battle

00:02:52.010 --> 00:02:52.020 
off the mini-map is amazing in battle

00:02:52.020 --> 00:02:53.690 
off the mini-map is amazing in battle
for<00:02:52.110> three<00:02:52.290> since<00:02:52.500> so<00:02:52.620> many<00:02:52.770> people<00:02:53.070> rely<00:02:53.280> on

00:02:53.690 --> 00:02:53.700 
for three since so many people rely on

00:02:53.700 --> 00:02:56.180 
for three since so many people rely on
the<00:02:54.180> mini-map<00:02:54.600> but<00:02:55.170> the<00:02:55.380> problem<00:02:55.770> with<00:02:55.920> it<00:02:55.950> is

00:02:56.180 --> 00:02:56.190 
the mini-map but the problem with it is

00:02:56.190 --> 00:02:58.150 
the mini-map but the problem with it is
that<00:02:56.220> it<00:02:56.670> reduces<00:02:56.850> the<00:02:57.330> bullet<00:02:57.600> velocity

00:02:58.150 --> 00:02:58.160 
that it reduces the bullet velocity

00:02:58.160 --> 00:03:02.600 
that it reduces the bullet velocity
significantly<00:02:59.160> the<00:02:59.670> an-94<00:03:00.480> has<00:03:00.750> a<00:03:01.050> solid<00:03:01.610> 600

00:03:02.600 --> 00:03:02.610 
significantly the an-94 has a solid 600

00:03:02.610 --> 00:03:05.090 
significantly the an-94 has a solid 600
meters<00:03:03.300> per<00:03:03.510> second<00:03:03.870> velocity<00:03:04.050> when<00:03:04.980> you're

00:03:05.090 --> 00:03:05.100 
meters per second velocity when you're

00:03:05.100 --> 00:03:06.530 
meters per second velocity when you're
not<00:03:05.220> using<00:03:05.459> the<00:03:05.670> suppressor<00:03:05.910> which<00:03:06.360> is

00:03:06.530 --> 00:03:06.540 
not using the suppressor which is

00:03:06.540 --> 00:03:08.420 
not using the suppressor which is
fantastic<00:03:07.050> I<00:03:07.530> mean<00:03:07.770> bullets<00:03:08.250> are<00:03:08.340> gonna

00:03:08.420 --> 00:03:08.430 
fantastic I mean bullets are gonna

00:03:08.430 --> 00:03:10.370 
fantastic I mean bullets are gonna
travel<00:03:08.700> downrange<00:03:09.420> extremely<00:03:09.930> quickly<00:03:10.140> and

00:03:10.370 --> 00:03:10.380 
travel downrange extremely quickly and

00:03:10.380 --> 00:03:11.810 
travel downrange extremely quickly and
you're<00:03:10.830> gonna<00:03:10.920> be<00:03:11.070> able<00:03:11.220> to<00:03:11.310> take<00:03:11.459> people<00:03:11.580> out

00:03:11.810 --> 00:03:11.820 
you're gonna be able to take people out

00:03:11.820 --> 00:03:13.550 
you're gonna be able to take people out
at<00:03:12.060> long<00:03:12.330> range<00:03:12.750> without<00:03:12.930> having<00:03:13.500> to

00:03:13.550 --> 00:03:13.560 
at long range without having to

00:03:13.560 --> 00:03:14.960 
at long range without having to
compensate<00:03:14.010> for<00:03:14.160> a<00:03:14.220> whole<00:03:14.370> lot<00:03:14.610> of<00:03:14.640> bullet

00:03:14.960 --> 00:03:14.970 
compensate for a whole lot of bullet

00:03:14.970 --> 00:03:17.270 
compensate for a whole lot of bullet
drop<00:03:15.209> but<00:03:15.840> when<00:03:15.990> you<00:03:16.140> put<00:03:16.440> the<00:03:16.650> suppressor<00:03:17.160> on

00:03:17.270 --> 00:03:17.280 
drop but when you put the suppressor on

00:03:17.280 --> 00:03:20.380 
drop but when you put the suppressor on
it<00:03:17.459> it<00:03:17.910> drops<00:03:18.390> it<00:03:18.630> nearly<00:03:19.200> in<00:03:19.350> half<00:03:19.380> it<00:03:19.830> goes<00:03:19.980> to

00:03:20.380 --> 00:03:20.390 
it it drops it nearly in half it goes to

00:03:20.390 --> 00:03:23.509 
it it drops it nearly in half it goes to
330<00:03:21.390> meters<00:03:21.840> per<00:03:22.019> second<00:03:22.440> which<00:03:22.800> isn't<00:03:23.070> the

00:03:23.509 --> 00:03:23.519 
330 meters per second which isn't the

00:03:23.519 --> 00:03:25.400 
330 meters per second which isn't the
worst<00:03:23.790> out<00:03:24.060> of<00:03:24.269> the<00:03:24.330> weapons<00:03:24.660> by<00:03:24.810> any<00:03:25.019> means<00:03:25.260> I

00:03:25.400 --> 00:03:25.410 
worst out of the weapons by any means I

00:03:25.410 --> 00:03:27.320 
worst out of the weapons by any means I
mean<00:03:25.560> you<00:03:25.650> can<00:03:25.769> you<00:03:25.950> could<00:03:26.160> do<00:03:26.400> worse<00:03:26.640> and<00:03:26.970> it's

00:03:27.320 --> 00:03:27.330 
mean you can you could do worse and it's

00:03:27.330 --> 00:03:28.880 
mean you can you could do worse and it's
not<00:03:27.480> like<00:03:27.630> throwing<00:03:27.840> rocks<00:03:28.200> at<00:03:28.380> the<00:03:28.470> target

00:03:28.880 --> 00:03:28.890 
not like throwing rocks at the target

00:03:28.890 --> 00:03:30.650 
not like throwing rocks at the target
but<00:03:29.370> it<00:03:29.459> was<00:03:29.580> still<00:03:29.790> significant<00:03:30.420> enough

00:03:30.650 --> 00:03:30.660 
but it was still significant enough

00:03:30.660 --> 00:03:32.479 
but it was still significant enough
we're<00:03:30.959> trying<00:03:31.260> to<00:03:31.350> go<00:03:31.440> for<00:03:31.620> someone<00:03:31.830> at<00:03:32.100> range

00:03:32.479 --> 00:03:32.489 
we're trying to go for someone at range

we're trying to go for someone at range
was<00:03:32.940> a<00:03:33.180> little<00:03:33.540> bit<00:03:33.660> painful<00:03:33.870> but<00:03:34.350> once<00:03:34.890> again

00:03:35.030 --> 00:03:35.040 
was a little bit painful but once again

00:03:35.040 --> 00:03:38.030 
was a little bit painful but once again
because<00:03:35.700> of<00:03:36.120> the<00:03:36.510> benefit<00:03:36.959> of<00:03:36.989> just<00:03:37.530> having<00:03:37.890> a

00:03:38.030 --> 00:03:38.040 
because of the benefit of just having a

00:03:38.040 --> 00:03:39.920 
because of the benefit of just having a
high<00:03:38.250> rpm<00:03:38.489> for<00:03:38.970> those<00:03:39.120> first<00:03:39.300> couple<00:03:39.510> of<00:03:39.720> shots

00:03:39.920 --> 00:03:39.930 
high rpm for those first couple of shots

00:03:39.930 --> 00:03:42.470 
high rpm for those first couple of shots
as<00:03:40.110> long<00:03:40.680> as<00:03:40.830> I<00:03:40.920> burst<00:03:41.130> fired<00:03:41.489> and<00:03:41.760> as<00:03:42.239> long<00:03:42.450> as

as long as I burst fired and as long as
I<00:03:42.810> was<00:03:43.260> you<00:03:43.410> know<00:03:43.440> fairly<00:03:44.040> accurate<00:03:44.489> with<00:03:44.640> my

00:03:44.810 --> 00:03:44.820 
I was you know fairly accurate with my

00:03:44.820 --> 00:03:46.820 
I was you know fairly accurate with my
shots<00:03:45.090> I<00:03:45.239> was<00:03:45.450> still<00:03:45.750> taking<00:03:45.989> people<00:03:46.410> out<00:03:46.560> at<00:03:46.799> a

00:03:46.820 --> 00:03:46.830 
shots I was still taking people out at a

00:03:46.830 --> 00:03:49.400 
shots I was still taking people out at a
distance<00:03:47.310> which<00:03:47.910> was<00:03:48.299> you<00:03:48.840> know<00:03:48.870> fairly

00:03:49.400 --> 00:03:49.410 
distance which was you know fairly

00:03:49.410 --> 00:03:51.620 
distance which was you know fairly
surprising<00:03:49.830> the<00:03:50.580> photograph<00:03:51.150> itself<00:03:51.390> was

00:03:51.620 --> 00:03:51.630 
surprising the photograph itself was

00:03:51.630 --> 00:03:53.900 
surprising the photograph itself was
also<00:03:51.870> a<00:03:52.080> pretty<00:03:52.350> big<00:03:52.530> hindrance<00:03:52.830> while<00:03:53.610> it

00:03:53.900 --> 00:03:53.910 
also a pretty big hindrance while it

00:03:53.910 --> 00:03:56.030 
also a pretty big hindrance while it
made<00:03:54.150> it<00:03:54.299> so<00:03:54.450> that<00:03:54.480> my<00:03:54.780> accuracy<00:03:55.440> up<00:03:55.590> close<00:03:55.830> I

00:03:56.030 --> 00:03:56.040 
made it so that my accuracy up close I

00:03:56.040 --> 00:03:57.350 
made it so that my accuracy up close I
guess<00:03:56.220> was<00:03:56.430> a<00:03:56.459> little<00:03:56.850> bit<00:03:56.970> more<00:03:57.180> manageable

00:03:57.350 --> 00:03:57.360 
guess was a little bit more manageable

00:03:57.360 --> 00:03:59.840 
guess was a little bit more manageable
trying<00:03:58.260> to<00:03:58.320> take<00:03:58.470> people<00:03:58.769> out<00:03:58.890> at<00:03:59.130> a<00:03:59.160> long

00:03:59.840 --> 00:03:59.850 
trying to take people out at a long

00:03:59.850 --> 00:04:02.390 
trying to take people out at a long
range<00:03:59.880> became<00:04:00.750> even<00:04:01.320> more<00:04:01.769> challenging

00:04:02.390 --> 00:04:02.400 
range became even more challenging

00:04:02.400 --> 00:04:04.460 
range became even more challenging
because<00:04:02.549> it<00:04:02.790> increased<00:04:03.180> my<00:04:03.540> bullet<00:04:03.959> deviation

00:04:04.460 --> 00:04:04.470 
because it increased my bullet deviation

00:04:04.470 --> 00:04:07.310 
because it increased my bullet deviation
so<00:04:04.920> even<00:04:05.160> if<00:04:05.280> I<00:04:05.549> was<00:04:06.120> on<00:04:06.540> target<00:04:07.019> even<00:04:07.140> though

00:04:07.310 --> 00:04:07.320 
so even if I was on target even though

00:04:07.320 --> 00:04:09.380 
so even if I was on target even though
my<00:04:07.590> cursor<00:04:07.950> was<00:04:08.130> directly<00:04:08.549> over<00:04:08.910> the<00:04:09.030> enemy's

00:04:09.380 --> 00:04:09.390 
my cursor was directly over the enemy's

00:04:09.390 --> 00:04:11.449 
my cursor was directly over the enemy's
head<00:04:09.630> because<00:04:10.290> of<00:04:10.380> the<00:04:10.440> bullet<00:04:10.709> deviation<00:04:11.310> I

00:04:11.449 --> 00:04:11.459 
head because of the bullet deviation I

00:04:11.459 --> 00:04:13.370 
head because of the bullet deviation I
still<00:04:11.790> wasn't<00:04:12.090> getting<00:04:12.360> a<00:04:12.570> lot<00:04:12.600> of<00:04:12.810> those<00:04:13.049> long

00:04:13.370 --> 00:04:13.380 
still wasn't getting a lot of those long

00:04:13.380 --> 00:04:16.130 
still wasn't getting a lot of those long
range<00:04:13.739> kills<00:04:14.010> and<00:04:14.340> so<00:04:14.820> when<00:04:15.150> I<00:04:15.480> approach

00:04:16.130 --> 00:04:16.140 
range kills and so when I approach

00:04:16.140 --> 00:04:18.710 
range kills and so when I approach
combat<00:04:16.739> I<00:04:16.950> tried<00:04:17.400> to<00:04:17.580> play<00:04:17.790> more<00:04:18.120> of<00:04:18.180> the

00:04:18.710 --> 00:04:18.720 
combat I tried to play more of the

00:04:18.720 --> 00:04:19.849 
combat I tried to play more of the
medium<00:04:19.080> game<00:04:19.260> and<00:04:19.380> I<00:04:19.410> felt<00:04:19.590> like<00:04:19.650> that<00:04:19.709> was

00:04:19.849 --> 00:04:19.859 
medium game and I felt like that was

00:04:19.859 --> 00:04:21.620 
medium game and I felt like that was
kind<00:04:20.280> of<00:04:20.430> the<00:04:20.549> sweet<00:04:20.850> spot<00:04:21.180> for<00:04:21.209> this

00:04:21.620 --> 00:04:21.630 
kind of the sweet spot for this

00:04:21.630 --> 00:04:24.080 
kind of the sweet spot for this
combination<00:04:22.260> of<00:04:22.410> attachments<00:04:23.070> it<00:04:23.370> wasn't<00:04:23.820> too

00:04:24.080 --> 00:04:24.090 
combination of attachments it wasn't too

00:04:24.090 --> 00:04:25.460 
combination of attachments it wasn't too
far<00:04:24.360> out<00:04:24.570> where<00:04:24.780> I<00:04:24.810> was<00:04:24.930> going<00:04:24.990> to<00:04:25.140> have<00:04:25.260> a<00:04:25.289> lot

00:04:25.460 --> 00:04:25.470 
far out where I was going to have a lot

00:04:25.470 --> 00:04:26.290 
far out where I was going to have a lot
of<00:04:25.590> bullet<00:04:25.800> DV

00:04:26.290 --> 00:04:26.300 
of bullet DV

00:04:26.300 --> 00:04:28.270 
of bullet DV
and<00:04:26.629> I<00:04:26.659> was<00:04:26.780> having<00:04:26.930> to<00:04:27.110> compensate<00:04:27.560> for<00:04:27.800> a<00:04:27.830> lot

00:04:28.270 --> 00:04:28.280 
and I was having to compensate for a lot

00:04:28.280 --> 00:04:30.939 
and I was having to compensate for a lot
of<00:04:28.310> the<00:04:28.669> slower<00:04:29.000> bullet<00:04:29.780> travel<00:04:30.169> speed<00:04:30.409> but<00:04:30.889> at

00:04:30.939 --> 00:04:30.949 
of the slower bullet travel speed but at

00:04:30.949 --> 00:04:33.730 
of the slower bullet travel speed but at
the<00:04:31.009> same<00:04:31.220> time<00:04:31.550> I<00:04:31.580> was<00:04:31.819> also<00:04:31.879> not<00:04:32.780> too<00:04:33.349> close

00:04:33.730 --> 00:04:33.740 
the same time I was also not too close

00:04:33.740 --> 00:04:36.309 
the same time I was also not too close
where<00:04:34.370> the<00:04:34.669> seven<00:04:35.000> times<00:04:35.240> scope<00:04:35.599> was<00:04:35.840> a<00:04:35.870> huge

00:04:36.309 --> 00:04:36.319 
where the seven times scope was a huge

00:04:36.319 --> 00:04:37.540 
where the seven times scope was a huge
hindrance<00:04:36.620> and<00:04:36.949> making<00:04:37.280> it<00:04:37.370> almost

00:04:37.540 --> 00:04:37.550 
hindrance and making it almost

00:04:37.550 --> 00:04:39.850 
hindrance and making it almost
impossible<00:04:38.210> to<00:04:38.270> take<00:04:38.360> people<00:04:38.690> out<00:04:38.900> but<00:04:39.470> what

00:04:39.850 --> 00:04:39.860 
impossible to take people out but what

00:04:39.860 --> 00:04:42.010 
impossible to take people out but what
was<00:04:40.039> interesting<00:04:40.460> about<00:04:40.789> this<00:04:41.120> was<00:04:41.449> that<00:04:41.479> even

00:04:42.010 --> 00:04:42.020 
was interesting about this was that even

00:04:42.020 --> 00:04:44.200 
was interesting about this was that even
when<00:04:42.259> I<00:04:42.289> was<00:04:42.470> in<00:04:42.889> the<00:04:43.250> thick<00:04:43.430> of<00:04:43.580> things<00:04:43.759> people

00:04:44.200 --> 00:04:44.210 
when I was in the thick of things people

00:04:44.210 --> 00:04:46.300 
when I was in the thick of things people
were<00:04:44.479> running<00:04:44.780> all<00:04:44.960> around<00:04:45.139> me<00:04:45.560> and<00:04:45.590> I<00:04:45.800> was<00:04:45.830> in

00:04:46.300 --> 00:04:46.310 
were running all around me and I was in

00:04:46.310 --> 00:04:49.119 
were running all around me and I was in
those<00:04:46.520> close<00:04:46.940> encounter<00:04:47.539> conflicts<00:04:48.139> I<00:04:48.379> was

00:04:49.119 --> 00:04:49.129 
those close encounter conflicts I was

00:04:49.129 --> 00:04:50.830 
those close encounter conflicts I was
still<00:04:49.400> winning<00:04:49.699> firefights<00:04:50.210> against<00:04:50.599> people

00:04:50.830 --> 00:04:50.840 
still winning firefights against people

00:04:50.840 --> 00:04:53.559 
still winning firefights against people
that<00:04:50.870> were<00:04:51.139> using<00:04:51.560> those<00:04:52.250> high<00:04:52.669> rpm<00:04:53.240> weapons

00:04:53.559 --> 00:04:53.569 
that were using those high rpm weapons

00:04:53.569 --> 00:04:57.430 
that were using those high rpm weapons
like<00:04:53.720> the<00:04:53.810> f2000<00:04:54.800> the<00:04:55.039> AEK<00:04:55.669> the<00:04:55.849> m16a3<00:04:56.599> and<00:04:56.780> I'm

00:04:57.430 --> 00:04:57.440 
like the f2000 the AEK the m16a3 and I'm

00:04:57.440 --> 00:04:59.649 
like the f2000 the AEK the m16a3 and I'm
sure<00:04:57.590> it<00:04:57.710> was<00:04:57.830> a<00:04:57.860> large<00:04:58.669> combination<00:04:59.539> of

00:04:59.649 --> 00:04:59.659 
sure it was a large combination of

00:04:59.659 --> 00:05:01.209 
sure it was a large combination of
factors<00:05:00.020> it<00:05:00.199> had<00:05:00.319> to<00:05:00.409> probably<00:05:00.710> do<00:05:00.830> with<00:05:01.039> their

00:05:01.209 --> 00:05:01.219 
factors it had to probably do with their

00:05:01.219 --> 00:05:03.550 
factors it had to probably do with their
player<00:05:01.460> skill<00:05:01.849> luck<00:05:02.719> you<00:05:03.110> know<00:05:03.229> they<00:05:03.409> probably

00:05:03.550 --> 00:05:03.560 
player skill luck you know they probably

00:05:03.560 --> 00:05:06.010 
player skill luck you know they probably
weren't<00:05:04.009> the<00:05:04.190> best<00:05:04.310> players<00:05:04.729> out<00:05:05.030> there<00:05:05.060> but<00:05:05.990> I

00:05:06.010 --> 00:05:06.020 
weren't the best players out there but I

00:05:06.020 --> 00:05:08.740 
weren't the best players out there but I
was<00:05:06.229> also<00:05:06.440> just<00:05:06.889> kind<00:05:07.129> of<00:05:07.310> on<00:05:07.789> I<00:05:08.300> was<00:05:08.449> just<00:05:08.599> on

00:05:08.740 --> 00:05:08.750 
was also just kind of on I was just on

00:05:08.750 --> 00:05:10.749 
was also just kind of on I was just on
fire<00:05:08.780> on<00:05:09.319> some<00:05:09.500> of<00:05:09.590> these<00:05:09.710> matches<00:05:10.159> and<00:05:10.280> as

00:05:10.749 --> 00:05:10.759 
fire on some of these matches and as

00:05:10.759 --> 00:05:12.369 
fire on some of these matches and as
long<00:05:11.030> as<00:05:11.060> I<00:05:11.300> felt<00:05:11.539> like<00:05:11.659> I<00:05:11.780> was<00:05:11.930> able<00:05:12.050> to<00:05:12.199> get

00:05:12.369 --> 00:05:12.379 
long as I felt like I was able to get

00:05:12.379 --> 00:05:14.379 
long as I felt like I was able to get
those<00:05:12.590> first<00:05:12.919> couple<00:05:13.099> of<00:05:13.340> shots<00:05:13.610> off<00:05:13.849> to<00:05:14.270> take

00:05:14.379 --> 00:05:14.389 
those first couple of shots off to take

00:05:14.389 --> 00:05:16.839 
those first couple of shots off to take
advantage<00:05:14.840> of<00:05:15.080> the<00:05:15.409> high<00:05:15.710> rpm<00:05:16.219> of<00:05:16.460> the<00:05:16.639> first

00:05:16.839 --> 00:05:16.849 
advantage of the high rpm of the first

00:05:16.849 --> 00:05:19.119 
advantage of the high rpm of the first
and<00:05:17.030> second<00:05:17.330> shot<00:05:17.509> I<00:05:17.719> was<00:05:18.319> still<00:05:18.620> winning

00:05:19.119 --> 00:05:19.129 
and second shot I was still winning

00:05:19.129 --> 00:05:20.920 
and second shot I was still winning
those<00:05:19.370> firefights<00:05:19.969> and<00:05:20.210> it<00:05:20.300> was<00:05:20.389> extremely

00:05:20.920 --> 00:05:20.930 
those firefights and it was extremely

00:05:20.930 --> 00:05:23.830 
those firefights and it was extremely
satisfying<00:05:21.590> and<00:05:22.219> so<00:05:22.699> overall<00:05:23.090> I<00:05:23.419> had<00:05:23.719> an

00:05:23.830 --> 00:05:23.840 
satisfying and so overall I had an

00:05:23.840 --> 00:05:25.629 
satisfying and so overall I had an
absolute<00:05:24.319> blast<00:05:24.560> with<00:05:24.710> this<00:05:24.919> challenge<00:05:25.190> and<00:05:25.580> I

00:05:25.629 --> 00:05:25.639 
absolute blast with this challenge and I

00:05:25.639 --> 00:05:26.980 
absolute blast with this challenge and I
know<00:05:25.699> that<00:05:26.060> you<00:05:26.210> guys<00:05:26.360> were<00:05:26.539> trying<00:05:26.780> to<00:05:26.870> make

00:05:26.980 --> 00:05:26.990 
know that you guys were trying to make

00:05:26.990 --> 00:05:29.260 
know that you guys were trying to make
the<00:05:27.169> an-94<00:05:27.979> worthless<00:05:28.550> with<00:05:28.759> his<00:05:28.909> combination

00:05:29.260 --> 00:05:29.270 
the an-94 worthless with his combination

00:05:29.270 --> 00:05:31.480 
the an-94 worthless with his combination
of<00:05:29.659> attachments<00:05:30.229> and<00:05:30.349> I<00:05:30.680> would<00:05:30.889> say<00:05:31.130> that<00:05:31.340> it's

00:05:31.480 --> 00:05:31.490 
of attachments and I would say that it's

00:05:31.490 --> 00:05:33.459 
of attachments and I would say that it's
nowhere<00:05:31.699> near<00:05:31.940> the<00:05:32.240> potential<00:05:32.840> of<00:05:33.020> the<00:05:33.169> weapon

00:05:33.459 --> 00:05:33.469 
nowhere near the potential of the weapon

00:05:33.469 --> 00:05:36.610 
nowhere near the potential of the weapon
itself<00:05:33.650> but<00:05:34.490> it<00:05:34.639> was<00:05:34.759> still<00:05:35.090> good<00:05:35.960> enough<00:05:36.349> and

00:05:36.610 --> 00:05:36.620 
itself but it was still good enough and

00:05:36.620 --> 00:05:39.279 
itself but it was still good enough and
effective<00:05:37.610> enough<00:05:37.880> where<00:05:38.120> as<00:05:38.360> long<00:05:38.630> as<00:05:38.840> I<00:05:38.990> was

00:05:39.279 --> 00:05:39.289 
effective enough where as long as I was

00:05:39.289 --> 00:05:41.890 
effective enough where as long as I was
accurate<00:05:39.800> and<00:05:39.979> as<00:05:40.310> long<00:05:40.580> as<00:05:40.819> I<00:05:40.969> was<00:05:41.180> on<00:05:41.300> fire<00:05:41.599> I

00:05:41.890 --> 00:05:41.900 
accurate and as long as I was on fire I

00:05:41.900 --> 00:05:44.290 
accurate and as long as I was on fire I
was<00:05:42.080> still<00:05:42.440> able<00:05:42.710> to<00:05:42.889> be<00:05:43.190> fairly<00:05:43.669> successful

00:05:44.290 --> 00:05:44.300 
was still able to be fairly successful

00:05:44.300 --> 00:05:46.300 
was still able to be fairly successful
with<00:05:44.419> it<00:05:44.569> but<00:05:45.169> that<00:05:45.289> is<00:05:45.409> about<00:05:45.500> it<00:05:45.650> for<00:05:45.800> today's
