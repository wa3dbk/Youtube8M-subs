00:00:04.590 --> 00:00:08.420
 the world today within our context but let's spread a little culture 

00:00:08.420 --> 00:00:10.459
 a little knowledge 

00:00:10.459 --> 00:00:13.799
 - Let's talk about the general theory of management 

00:00:15.269 --> 00:00:18.859
 You're going to talk like this, if you're going to ask, on the day the sky is dry. 

00:00:18.859 --> 00:00:21.349
 doing the good of the music-hall 

00:00:21.349 --> 00:00:22.630
 that's exactly it 

00:00:22.630 --> 00:00:27.109
 are very important things and everything that involves knowledge culture 

00:00:27.109 --> 00:00:31.310
 happen here inside our side oak star ground 

00:00:31.310 --> 00:00:34.000
 I'm receiving the double person visit 

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:35.640
 are you planning 

00:00:35.640 --> 00:00:38.260
 is launching this book 

00:00:38.260 --> 00:00:44.230
 general theory of management it takes a totally different approach 

00:00:44.230 --> 00:00:47.310
 and I already start by asking the teacher 

00:00:47.310 --> 00:00:50.390
 with that the vote 

00:00:50.390 --> 00:00:54.930
 all administration theories that there are methods of books equal 

00:00:54.930 --> 00:00:55.719
 commitment 

00:00:55.719 --> 00:00:58.510
 existing here so far 

00:00:58.510 --> 00:00:59.520
 in Brazil 

00:00:59.520 --> 00:01:03.720
 they version on these theories that comes from foreign authors 

00:01:04.560 --> 00:01:06.280
 and for the first time 

00:01:06.280 --> 00:01:07.380
 the author 

00:01:07.380 --> 00:01:08.680
 there is no version of 

00:01:08.680 --> 00:01:12.840
 with the through Brazilian characters how does this work 

00:01:13.840 --> 00:01:17.230
 works when you want to break paradigms and you make a difference 

00:01:17.230 --> 00:01:20.930
 then became general theory of administration is made in Brazil 

00:01:20.930 --> 00:01:23.990
 it is based on three strands the sport 

00:01:23.990 --> 00:01:27.240
 darwin price came to arrest two 

00:01:27.240 --> 00:01:30.720
 what else is playing in the ditch 

00:01:30.720 --> 00:01:33.720
 and how is it that 

00:01:37.800 --> 00:01:41.210
 the sport's first legend that the sporting was it played in teams 

00:01:41.210 --> 00:01:45.350
 then go to you transform styrofoam administrator and have to know a lot 

00:01:45.350 --> 00:01:48.480
 work in team then actually olive tree using metaphors 

00:01:49.200 --> 00:01:52.390
 and we through the metaphors of football itself will not give you an example 

00:01:53.250 --> 00:01:57.330
 the director-financier iriri is usually a more conservative guy staying in the 

00:01:57.330 --> 00:02:00.330
 the back of the companies that the marketing director gets ahead of 

00:02:01.120 --> 00:02:04.100
 has a football coach who taught us the cloud and continues selection 

00:02:04.100 --> 00:02:05.090
 there was a wash 

00:02:05.090 --> 00:02:08.410
 from where she comes next nor future the guy goes forward ilda face of the front 

00:02:08.410 --> 00:02:10.410
 nor backwards then we can not reverse 

00:02:10.410 --> 00:02:13.220
 let's put the finance director on the front line director of madrid 

00:02:13.220 --> 00:02:16.609
 while waiting only to know how each position works 

00:02:16.609 --> 00:02:21.249
 is a great range of a great idea right now because in the financial moment 

00:02:21.249 --> 00:02:25.049
 until then it does not give very well as e-mail archives registered more than visa 

00:02:25.049 --> 00:02:28.729
 as someone is spending money but of effect but it is still understood and 

00:02:28.729 --> 00:02:32.510
 who are now in the metaphor of football I can teach administration 

00:02:32.509 --> 00:02:36.559
 people in a simple way and in a way that can understand interpreting and 

00:02:36.559 --> 00:02:38.979
 make them action it in practical life 

00:02:38.979 --> 00:02:43.739
 so is any person can live that is is to have the possibility of a 

00:02:43.739 --> 00:02:44.789
 understanding 

00:02:44.789 --> 00:02:45.879
 bigger 

00:02:45.879 --> 00:02:49.549
 about general manager theory of management through this book he 

00:02:49.549 --> 00:02:51.219
 simplifies all this 

00:02:51.219 --> 00:02:55.379
 perfectly in addition to simplifying it and the defender who says they are 

00:02:55.379 --> 00:02:58.029
 interesting that I can talk to you in a moment more just to 

00:02:58.029 --> 00:02:58.879
 begin 

00:02:58.879 --> 00:03:02.099
 At the beginning of the book I say that the administration is a rocket inventory 

00:03:02.099 --> 00:03:06.319
 have with fresh water that is physical and political mathematical philosophy is enough 

00:03:06.319 --> 00:03:09.409
 customer prefer gasoline cases whats his gasoline profession 

00:03:09.409 --> 00:03:12.510
 human resources in March are the four areas of administration 

00:03:13.269 --> 00:03:15.959
 if the ford gt driver is the administrator 

00:03:15.959 --> 00:03:19.619
 then see well for you to understand administration in a context 

00:03:19.619 --> 00:03:23.629
 Brazilian so you can be a philosopher to be a mathematician if you politician 

00:03:23.629 --> 00:03:25.049
 this fiscal 

00:03:25.049 --> 00:03:28.369
 there is to do a milk administration brazil 

00:03:28.369 --> 00:03:33.459
 Look, I might even have recommended it to you whether the book is about politicians and 

00:03:33.459 --> 00:03:35.110
 politicians on duty ii 

00:03:35.110 --> 00:03:37.699
 here you intend to drive 

00:03:37.699 --> 00:03:41.589
 sing as candidates for councilors to mayors 

00:03:41.589 --> 00:03:45.549
 is only part of the public administration is also contemplated in that book 

00:03:47.339 --> 00:03:49.119
 and it goes further then 

00:03:49.119 --> 00:03:53.430
 has a chapter devoted entirely to women called administration 

00:03:53.429 --> 00:03:54.539
 feminine 

00:03:54.539 --> 00:03:56.559
 in this chapter I was me 

00:03:56.559 --> 00:04:02.089
 I say that 19% of the women studied administration in Brazil that already goes 

00:04:02.089 --> 00:04:07.639
 in 25% I think that soon 51% of students will be female 

00:04:08.829 --> 00:04:12.159
 I wrote an article in the magazine of the superior school of advertising and marketing ti do 

00:04:12.159 --> 00:04:14.389
 that the women reach the presidency of the republic 

00:04:14.389 --> 00:04:16.749
 men and have regained this position. 

00:04:16.749 --> 00:04:21.289
 your ideal team is to be very sincere I also think by the way I think the woman 

00:04:21.289 --> 00:04:22.990
 should take care of itself 

00:04:22.990 --> 00:04:26.400
 it was the bottom in the background she has already taken care of in person 

00:04:26.400 --> 00:04:28.590
 we pretend to be dead he wants 

00:04:28.590 --> 00:04:34.219
 falls case of demand - show she does not have and does not have much our cabaral 

00:04:34.219 --> 00:04:36.830
 the protection of planned production 

00:04:36.830 --> 00:04:40.360
 it is natural that of goias that city solves 

00:04:40.360 --> 00:04:41.439
 already neighborhood 

00:04:41.439 --> 00:04:44.719
 It's a city that has some friends of rule donated by a divorce 

00:04:45.289 --> 00:04:48.289
 University plane leftovers are milestones in administration 

00:04:48.819 --> 00:04:52.099
 then I did good in marketing experience at the high school of 

00:04:52.099 --> 00:04:55.909
 advertising and marketing I am a master in management from puc de sÃ£o paulo and 

00:04:55.909 --> 00:04:59.219

 so people can get in touch and also on the phone 

00:05:06.110 --> 00:05:13.449
 the phone rings 11 seven and a half smaller imc afraid to hi or 47 01 was hurt 8 2 

00:05:13.449 --> 00:05:18.379
 and the site the date of the braval only picks up the mid-point or the date of the 

00:05:18.379 --> 00:05:19.759
 panigua vote 

00:05:19.759 --> 00:05:22.059
 point to bm with the foot 

00:05:22.059 --> 00:05:24.300
 You see, it's all very simple, right? 

00:05:24.300 --> 00:05:28.510
 And it's all settled and if you see everything that's happening there 

00:05:28.510 --> 00:05:29.919
 our little screen 

00:05:29.919 --> 00:05:31.659
 and Socrates to announce 

00:05:31.659 --> 00:05:35.990
 the final interview after saying that besides all these 

00:05:35.989 --> 00:05:39.949
 properties all these qualities and certifications 

00:05:39.949 --> 00:05:42.349
 in the process the production of the train line 

00:05:42.349 --> 00:05:45.139
 it is also correct 

00:05:45.139 --> 00:05:47.260
 yes another also has an importance 

00:05:47.260 --> 00:05:50.080
 too big for all of us 

00:05:50.080 --> 00:05:53.639
 perfect in curitiba where I lived in 2002 she met with the administration 

00:05:53.639 --> 00:05:56.639
 and because it would or it between science art and literature 

00:05:57.460 --> 00:06:01.840
 that the European Union offered in two phases like that of the student on the other side 

00:06:01.840 --> 00:06:05.789
 the 'teacher' and we found ourselves in the middle of the river management and it was crowded 

00:06:05.789 --> 00:06:09.730
 edel throw forward another book after day saw the next book that is 

00:06:09.729 --> 00:06:12.729

 General Theory of Dementia Nation Desk by Option Planned for Sale 

00:06:20.479 --> 00:06:25.819
