00:00:49.080 --> 00:00:49.090 
know just to actually have this design

00:00:49.090 --> 00:00:51.630 
know just to actually have this design
work<00:00:49.330> in<00:00:49.540> your<00:00:49.720> favor<00:00:50.050> but<00:00:50.560> you<00:00:51.250> know<00:00:51.340> it's

00:00:54.180 --> 00:00:54.190 
some things that it's a really easy way

00:00:54.190 --> 00:00:56.850 
some things that it's a really easy way
the<00:00:54.550> easiest<00:00:54.940> way<00:00:55.180> by<00:00:55.420> far<00:00:55.720> to<00:00:55.750> create<00:00:56.590> a<00:00:56.650> water

00:00:56.850 --> 00:00:56.860 
the easiest way by far to create a water

00:00:56.860 --> 00:00:58.530 
the easiest way by far to create a water
elevator<00:00:57.190> and<00:00:57.490> also<00:00:58.090> it's<00:00:58.240> one<00:00:58.330> of<00:00:58.450> the

00:00:58.530 --> 00:00:58.540 
elevator and also it's one of the

00:00:58.540 --> 00:01:02.070 
elevator and also it's one of the
fastest<00:00:59.020> ones<00:00:59.290> there<00:00:59.680> is<00:00:59.860> so<00:01:00.600> simply<00:01:01.600> just<00:01:01.930> do

00:01:02.070 --> 00:01:02.080 
fastest ones there is so simply just do

00:01:02.080 --> 00:01:04.529 
fastest ones there is so simply just do
this<00:01:02.290> create<00:01:02.620> a<00:01:02.680> plus<00:01:02.920> sign<00:01:03.190> get<00:01:04.180> a<00:01:04.210> bucket

00:01:04.529 --> 00:01:04.539 
this create a plus sign get a bucket

00:01:04.539 --> 00:01:07.410 
this create a plus sign get a bucket
which<00:01:04.960> you<00:01:05.320> can<00:01:05.499> access<00:01:05.979> you<00:01:06.369> know<00:01:06.490> um<00:01:06.789> my

00:01:07.410 --> 00:01:07.420 
which you can access you know um my

00:01:07.420 --> 00:01:10.230 
which you can access you know um my
finding<00:01:07.810> water<00:01:07.960> so<00:01:08.770> that's<00:01:09.159> not<00:01:09.729> too<00:01:09.969> hard<00:01:10.149> to

00:01:10.230 --> 00:01:10.240 
finding water so that's not too hard to

00:01:10.240 --> 00:01:12.510 
finding water so that's not too hard to
get<00:01:10.359> some<00:01:10.509> water<00:01:10.689> place<00:01:11.590> it<00:01:11.799> on<00:01:11.920> top<00:01:12.159> and

00:01:12.510 --> 00:01:12.520 
get some water place it on top and

00:01:12.520 --> 00:01:14.340 
get some water place it on top and
here's<00:01:12.999> where<00:01:13.179> a<00:01:13.210> careful<00:01:13.689> planning<00:01:13.990> comes

00:01:14.340 --> 00:01:14.350 
here's where a careful planning comes

00:01:14.350 --> 00:01:16.859 
here's where a careful planning comes
into<00:01:14.530> play<00:01:14.710> only<00:01:15.549> one<00:01:16.030> of<00:01:16.119> these<00:01:16.270> sides<00:01:16.509> one<00:01:16.810> of

00:01:16.859 --> 00:01:16.869 
into play only one of these sides one of

00:01:16.869 --> 00:01:18.300 
into play only one of these sides one of
these<00:01:16.990> corners<00:01:17.469> if<00:01:17.710> we're<00:01:17.859> lucky<00:01:17.979> we'll<00:01:18.219> get

00:01:18.300 --> 00:01:18.310 
these corners if we're lucky we'll get

00:01:18.310 --> 00:01:21.660 
these corners if we're lucky we'll get
into<00:01:18.490> first<00:01:18.759> try<00:01:19.649> well<00:01:20.649> hell<00:01:20.920> I<00:01:21.130> have<00:01:21.340> D<00:01:21.549> on

00:01:21.660 --> 00:01:21.670 
into first try well hell I have D on

00:01:21.670 --> 00:01:23.370 
into first try well hell I have D on
water<00:01:21.909> elevator<00:01:22.329> effect<00:01:22.689> and<00:01:22.899> I<00:01:22.960> found<00:01:23.259> it

00:01:23.370 --> 00:01:23.380 
water elevator effect and I found it

00:01:23.380 --> 00:01:24.749 
water elevator effect and I found it
right<00:01:23.590> here<00:01:23.649> as<00:01:23.920> you<00:01:24.009> can<00:01:24.039> see<00:01:24.280> it's<00:01:24.429> on<00:01:24.520> this

00:01:24.749 --> 00:01:24.759 
right here as you can see it's on this

00:01:24.759 --> 00:01:27.090 
right here as you can see it's on this
access<00:01:25.210> i'ma<00:01:25.990> show<00:01:26.200> you<00:01:26.319> guys<00:01:26.469> are<00:01:26.740> okay<00:01:27.069> so

00:01:27.090 --> 00:01:27.100

00:01:27.100 --> 00:01:28.830 
access i'ma show you guys are okay so
look<00:01:27.429> at<00:01:27.520> my<00:01:27.640> D<00:01:27.700> pad<00:01:28.060> under<00:01:28.329> lower<00:01:28.509> left-hand

00:01:28.830 --> 00:01:28.840 
look at my D pad under lower left-hand

00:01:28.840 --> 00:01:31.559 
look at my D pad under lower left-hand
corner<00:01:28.990> that<00:01:29.859> shows<00:01:30.130> that<00:01:30.399> I'm<00:01:30.670> flying<00:01:31.210> and

00:01:31.559 --> 00:01:31.569 
corner that shows that I'm flying and

00:01:31.569 --> 00:01:33.239 
corner that shows that I'm flying and
I'm<00:01:31.810> just<00:01:31.960> gonna<00:01:32.079> walk<00:01:32.200> straight<00:01:32.859> up<00:01:32.889> to<00:01:33.069> the

00:01:33.239 --> 00:01:33.249 
I'm just gonna walk straight up to the

00:01:33.249 --> 00:01:35.340 
I'm just gonna walk straight up to the
water<00:01:33.399> as<00:01:33.609> you<00:01:33.639> can<00:01:33.939> see<00:01:34.119> I'm<00:01:34.299> not<00:01:34.450> flying<00:01:34.719> so

00:01:35.340 --> 00:01:35.350 
water as you can see I'm not flying so

00:01:35.350 --> 00:01:37.709 
water as you can see I'm not flying so
it<00:01:35.469> does<00:01:35.619> work<00:01:35.649> in<00:01:36.069> survival<00:01:36.639> as<00:01:36.759> well<00:01:36.909> it<00:01:37.539> is<00:01:37.689> a

00:01:37.709 --> 00:01:37.719 
it does work in survival as well it is a

00:01:37.719 --> 00:01:40.080 
it does work in survival as well it is a
glitch<00:01:38.159> then<00:01:39.159> you<00:01:39.280> know<00:01:39.399> I<00:01:39.429> really<00:01:39.850> like<00:01:39.999> to

00:01:40.080 --> 00:01:40.090 
glitch then you know I really like to

00:01:40.090 --> 00:01:41.370 
glitch then you know I really like to
take<00:01:40.210> advantage<00:01:40.329> of<00:01:40.689> it's<00:01:40.990> probably<00:01:41.319> the

00:01:41.370 --> 00:01:41.380 
take advantage of it's probably the

00:01:41.380 --> 00:01:44.160 
take advantage of it's probably the
easiest<00:01:41.679> elevator<00:01:42.520> like<00:01:42.880> I<00:01:42.999> said<00:01:43.329> and<00:01:43.689> you<00:01:44.020> can

00:01:44.160 --> 00:01:44.170 
easiest elevator like I said and you can

00:01:44.170 --> 00:01:45.690 
easiest elevator like I said and you can
even<00:01:44.350> go<00:01:44.469> backwards<00:01:44.950> if<00:01:45.130> I<00:01:45.249> can<00:01:45.399> find<00:01:45.609> you

00:01:45.690 --> 00:01:45.700 
even go backwards if I can find you

00:01:45.700 --> 00:01:47.459 
even go backwards if I can find you
