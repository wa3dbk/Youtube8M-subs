00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.440
 now for you panama cheekbone increase 

00:00:03.210 --> 00:00:06.440
 without your surgery 

00:00:06.560 --> 00:00:10.769
 but of course that sounds good to me 

00:00:09.150 --> 00:00:13.290
 I wanted to be ready and I think that all 

00:00:10.769 --> 00:00:15.150
 they want because I do say wonderful 

00:00:13.290 --> 00:00:17.220
 plastic surgeons who come to throw him 

00:00:15.150 --> 00:00:19.260
 the little hand to one when really of 

00:00:17.220 --> 00:00:23.130
 nature did not come the complete package 

00:00:19.260 --> 00:00:26.039
 for you as she is very happy to see for 

00:00:23.130 --> 00:00:27.420
 Tell us please because there are times that 

00:00:26.039 --> 00:00:29.010
 that we think least is in the cheekbone 

00:00:27.420 --> 00:00:32.430
 acidity and how it has to do with the 

00:00:29.010 --> 00:00:34.590
 personality so that the strongest the 

00:00:32.430 --> 00:00:36.809
 that makes the cheekbone look very 

00:00:34.590 --> 00:00:40.079
 well the face is a symbol of beauty of 

00:00:36.809 --> 00:00:42.600
 have a common or originating makes you 

00:00:40.079 --> 00:00:44.520
 outline everything else makes this 

00:00:42.600 --> 00:00:46.980
 profile on the nose that you profile in 

00:00:44.520 --> 00:00:49.980
 environments and then when you see yourself more 

00:00:46.980 --> 00:00:51.329
 feminine and good people sometimes not 

00:00:49.980 --> 00:00:54.480
 will be against your position some rules of 

00:00:51.329 --> 00:00:57.720
 cheekbone and immediately change 

00:00:54.480 --> 00:00:59.790
 it looks more expensive they look more or less and 

00:00:57.720 --> 00:01:01.110
 Also as you say it looks stronger 

00:00:59.790 --> 00:01:03.629
 see more presence 

00:01:01.110 --> 00:01:06.900
 imagine you imagine Maria Felix without 

00:01:03.629 --> 00:01:09.990
 cheekbone that force we always said and 

00:01:06.900 --> 00:01:11.790
 about part of his presence not like 

00:01:09.990 --> 00:01:14.340
 we know when we do need a 

00:01:11.790 --> 00:01:16.259
 arranged in our little that good the 

00:01:14.340 --> 00:01:17.820
 cheekbone can be defined in two ways 

00:01:16.259 --> 00:01:18.840
 either doing the surgery of the 

00:01:17.820 --> 00:01:20.880
 cheeks of which we had already 

00:01:18.840 --> 00:01:22.619
 talked about although it is for example the one 

00:01:20.880 --> 00:01:25.170
 I bring that you get to notice more the 

00:01:22.619 --> 00:01:27.119
 cheekbone and the other one is that despite the 

00:01:25.170 --> 00:01:29.130
 cheek surgery or do not love you 

00:01:27.119 --> 00:01:31.500
 do that surgery or you are not a candidate 

00:01:29.130 --> 00:01:33.660
 because you do not have that much fat you have to 

00:01:31.500 --> 00:01:37.050
 make you put on your cheekbone because the little bone 

00:01:33.660 --> 00:01:39.869
 which is called the malar bone is very is 

00:01:37.050 --> 00:01:42.000
 all that area this plastic type or is 

00:01:39.869 --> 00:01:43.680
 very small is the area that we are 

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:46.020
 watching right now on the bench in the area 

00:01:43.680 --> 00:01:47.580
 to be able to make a cheekbone mind the 

00:01:46.020 --> 00:01:49.640
 area that we are going to fix is 

00:01:47.580 --> 00:01:52.920
 an area that is crescent shaped 

00:01:49.640 --> 00:01:53.610
 just where the eyelid ends 

00:01:52.920 --> 00:01:55.920
 lower 

00:01:53.610 --> 00:01:58.530
 we have a fat that is bad fat and 

00:01:55.920 --> 00:02:00.380
 that with time or can be chopped or 

00:01:58.530 --> 00:02:02.610
 that is to say be 

00:02:00.380 --> 00:02:04.290
 I do not know if you noticed that sometimes 

00:02:02.610 --> 00:02:06.720
 old people are seen as a 

00:02:04.290 --> 00:02:09.209
 little bag down here so if they were 

00:02:06.720 --> 00:02:11.160
 hung the top of the cheek 

00:02:09.209 --> 00:02:13.319
 with who is the one who is weird so is that 

00:02:11.160 --> 00:02:16.770
 I was swollen, I have not thrown 

00:02:13.319 --> 00:02:18.930
 participated and well that also speaks of 

00:02:16.770 --> 00:02:21.480
 that this success or not did not grow 

00:02:18.930 --> 00:02:24.239
 enough or with the age that they are already 

00:02:21.480 --> 00:02:26.430
 aging data be touch something 

00:02:24.239 --> 00:02:29.480
 success is also getting smaller 

00:02:26.430 --> 00:02:31.770
 and that makes your face look flat 

00:02:29.480 --> 00:02:34.530
 then that also causes the skin 

00:02:31.770 --> 00:02:36.150
 of your cheek and it looks like falling down 

00:02:34.530 --> 00:02:40.319
 fix your cheekbone still helps you 

00:02:36.150 --> 00:02:43.200
 further profile this trait facial features 

00:02:40.319 --> 00:02:46.200
 and 2 helps you stretch the skin and 

00:02:43.200 --> 00:02:49.260
 lift the skin is to say that it is also 

00:02:46.200 --> 00:02:51.900
 an anti-aging and rejuvenating treatment 

00:02:49.260 --> 00:02:53.940
 we can say it and then it 's like 

00:02:51.900 --> 00:02:55.920
 would do without science because if we have 

00:02:53.940 --> 00:02:57.299
 people who just think about 

00:02:55.920 --> 00:02:58.620
 surgery we start to tremble like 

00:02:57.299 --> 00:03:01.110
 gelatins truly 

00:02:58.620 --> 00:03:03.390
 and also because I would like to introduce myself 

00:03:01.110 --> 00:03:05.250
 after the implant there is an implant 

00:03:03.390 --> 00:03:07.470
 which is specific to this but 

00:03:05.250 --> 00:03:09.799
 Well, this program is about talking 

00:03:07.470 --> 00:03:12.540
 of those injections not how can we 

00:03:09.799 --> 00:03:14.819
 increase the cheekbone the tone can be 

00:03:12.540 --> 00:03:17.099
 increase in three ways with acid 

00:03:14.819 --> 00:03:19.530
 hyaluronic that I already presented to you 

00:03:17.099 --> 00:03:21.780
 more or less how is the injection and 

00:03:19.530 --> 00:03:24.390
 darlings and well this is an acid 

00:03:21.780 --> 00:03:25.980
 hyaluronic which is more viscous is more 

00:03:24.390 --> 00:03:28.620
 hard not to say that it's like a 

00:03:25.980 --> 00:03:30.420
 plasticine should be put 

00:03:28.620 --> 00:03:31.739
 anesthesia in the region 

00:03:30.420 --> 00:03:34.859
 we put an anesthetic 

00:03:31.739 --> 00:03:37.560
 around and then we do the injection 

00:03:34.859 --> 00:03:38.970
 of this material and we also mold it 

00:03:37.560 --> 00:03:40.500
 It can be done with other material that 

00:03:38.970 --> 00:03:43.200
 Calcium hydroxide flame 

00:03:40.500 --> 00:03:45.440
 and this is very close to the bone this is 

00:03:43.200 --> 00:03:47.790
 moldea 

00:03:45.440 --> 00:03:51.840
 you literally go and mold it 

00:03:47.790 --> 00:03:54.810
 surgeon with now these two these two 

00:03:51.840 --> 00:03:56.750
 products are then absorbed the acid 

00:03:54.810 --> 00:03:59.190
 hyaluronic when you can have a 

00:03:56.750 --> 00:04:00.840
 duration more or less than a year and a half two 

00:03:59.190 --> 00:04:02.160
 years and who would have to go back to 

00:04:00.840 --> 00:04:05.340
 do some retouching 

00:04:02.160 --> 00:04:07.860
 and the calcium hydroxide arrives during 

00:04:05.340 --> 00:04:09.510
 up to five years then good we have 

00:04:07.860 --> 00:04:11.790
 those options and I think they know them 

00:04:09.510 --> 00:04:13.620
 because we are talking about surgery 

00:04:11.790 --> 00:04:15.540
 ambulatory because they inject us 

00:04:13.620 --> 00:04:17.730
 existence and even if these 

00:04:15.540 --> 00:04:20.250
 they make a doctor's office we clean very well 

00:04:17.730 --> 00:04:23.280
 all the current region to face we put the 

00:04:20.250 --> 00:04:25.320
 anesthesia and we put injecting are 

00:04:23.280 --> 00:04:27.480
 picket bars and we're putting this 

00:04:25.320 --> 00:04:30.360
 product and we are shaping it with 

00:04:27.480 --> 00:04:32.580
 our hands and we are doing the way 

00:04:30.360 --> 00:04:34.590
 of semi moon to perform precisely 

00:04:32.580 --> 00:04:36.810
 this area that is the malar region the 

00:04:34.590 --> 00:04:38.280
 eaten region another product that 

00:04:36.810 --> 00:04:39.420
 we can use because sometimes people 

00:04:38.280 --> 00:04:41.880
 you tell me you know that I do not think that I 

00:04:39.420 --> 00:04:44.160
 put nothing strange in the face is your 

00:04:41.880 --> 00:04:46.530
 own grace or I already know that we take advantage of and 

00:04:44.160 --> 00:04:48.000
 we wanted a liposuction of double chin or 

00:04:46.530 --> 00:04:49.500
 We made some provision from another part 

00:04:48.000 --> 00:04:51.120
 of the body and you want to take advantage of that 

00:04:49.500 --> 00:04:53.400
 fat then you can take advantage of the 

00:04:51.120 --> 00:04:55.050
 fat we prepare it properly and 

00:04:53.400 --> 00:04:56.730
 also there if we have to make a 

00:04:55.050 --> 00:04:58.980
 small incision that good is not going to 

00:04:56.730 --> 00:05:01.200
 notice almost nothing because it is very finite is 

00:04:58.980 --> 00:05:03.030
 one of 10 millimeters we make it more or 

00:05:01.200 --> 00:05:05.550
 less this level right where you have 

00:05:03.030 --> 00:05:07.200
 some wrinkle to put the cannula 

00:05:05.550 --> 00:05:08.249
 because good if it has to be us with 

00:05:07.200 --> 00:05:10.229
 a 

00:05:08.249 --> 00:05:12.749
 thin needle and if it's a cannula 

00:05:10.229 --> 00:05:14.339
 special that we inject the amount that 

00:05:12.749 --> 00:05:16.259
 we consider necessary to increase the 

00:05:14.339 --> 00:05:19.559
 cheekbone and in this way we do it 

00:05:16.259 --> 00:05:21.599
 then vermilion for that is how much 

00:05:19.559 --> 00:05:23.489
 it took me 20 minutes and it's 

00:05:21.599 --> 00:05:25.469
 only that you injected this product 

00:05:23.489 --> 00:05:27.629
 and what good is not only in 

00:05:25.469 --> 00:05:29.699
 office by putting on anesthesia and 

00:05:27.629 --> 00:05:32.069
 putting the product more or less that 

00:05:29.699 --> 00:05:34.499
 it took us not to dance and remember your 

00:05:32.069 --> 00:05:37.829
 immediately you are in then go to your 

00:05:34.499 --> 00:05:39.509
 house you will notice that it is swollen that 

00:05:37.829 --> 00:05:41.659
 it is inflamed that is a little red 

00:05:39.509 --> 00:05:43.860
 because we are putting something not 

00:05:41.659 --> 00:05:45.839
 Even the skin is going to look stretched 

00:05:43.860 --> 00:05:48.569
 then if the recommendation is to put you 

00:05:45.839 --> 00:05:50.339
 ice you know that the face is extremely 

00:05:48.569 --> 00:05:52.289
 sensible delinquen 

00:05:50.339 --> 00:05:55.169
 a pinch a little touch you get 

00:05:52.289 --> 00:05:58.139
 super red then and he's healthy is very 

00:05:55.169 --> 00:06:00.239
 very red you have to put ice do not come out 

00:05:58.139 --> 00:06:02.219
 these horrific bruises and that can 

00:06:00.239 --> 00:06:04.289
 can be done because it's good that 

00:06:02.219 --> 00:06:07.199
 many clear glasses is that you notice 

00:06:04.289 --> 00:06:10.079
 some bruise but it's almost nothing not if the 

00:06:07.199 --> 00:06:13.249
 you have to go to work every day 

00:06:10.079 --> 00:06:16.469
 next look at this person wow that 

00:06:13.249 --> 00:06:18.329
 increase the cheekbone and we also put a 

00:06:16.469 --> 00:06:21.509
 filling in the nasogenian short but you see 

00:06:18.329 --> 00:06:24.079
 the difference or you take away 5 years 

00:06:21.509 --> 00:06:26.519
 I think 10 or 15 but easy 

00:06:24.079 --> 00:06:28.979
 looking at us because we also know a lot 

00:06:26.519 --> 00:06:31.559
 more youthful and the nose effectively like that 

00:06:28.979 --> 00:06:34.019
 as his eyebrows are marked much more mark 

00:06:31.559 --> 00:06:35.459
 of the chin looks much more profiled and 

00:06:34.019 --> 00:06:37.439
 look how nice they are seeing these pictures 

00:06:35.459 --> 00:06:39.509
 because immediately it says it's cheekbone and 

00:06:37.439 --> 00:06:42.179
 my first image is to see certain 

00:06:39.509 --> 00:06:44.339
 actresses for many years that their 

00:06:42.179 --> 00:06:46.829
 faces are fully widened and 

00:06:44.339 --> 00:06:48.659
 disfigured here is not corrected better since 

00:06:46.829 --> 00:06:50.849
 has changed the technique a lot truth and 

00:06:48.659 --> 00:06:53.939
 you always know that we want it to be what 

00:06:50.849 --> 00:06:55.949
 that will be more natural and also good 

00:06:53.939 --> 00:06:58.199
 take away that fear from people that 

00:06:55.949 --> 00:06:59.960
 know how clown they say they are 

00:06:58.199 --> 00:07:01.699
 two beads ay 

00:06:59.960 --> 00:07:03.979
 and then he's going to present the 

00:07:01.699 --> 00:07:05.870
 clear implant surgery I always 

00:07:03.979 --> 00:07:08.479
 I recommend if you want to try because not 

00:07:05.870 --> 00:07:10.580
 is sure sometimes we have restlessness 

00:07:08.479 --> 00:07:14.030
 it's my 5 I'm going to see we have the advantage 

00:07:10.580 --> 00:07:16.340
 that with the products or with the fat that 

00:07:14.030 --> 00:07:17.630
 is going to absorb and we could go back to 

00:07:16.340 --> 00:07:19.610
 our state disgusting if not we 

00:07:17.630 --> 00:07:20.479
 liked then if you liked it and sad 

00:07:19.610 --> 00:07:22.160
 you know that but now I want it 

00:07:20.479 --> 00:07:24.680
 permanent then if we talk later 

00:07:22.160 --> 00:07:26.840
 of the implant to fight that is going to 

00:07:24.680 --> 00:07:29.530
 like but please repeat them 

00:07:26.840 --> 00:07:32.270
 they have to go with certified doctors 

00:07:29.530 --> 00:07:33.530
 because indeed if they can be given in 

00:07:32.270 --> 00:07:36.530
 network especially here we are talking about that 

00:07:33.530 --> 00:07:38.570
 is molded is a material that is molded and 

00:07:36.530 --> 00:07:39.860
 not everyone has that balance that 

00:07:38.570 --> 00:07:41.930
 way to manage that is a 

00:07:39.860 --> 00:07:44.000
 training that has not been for years 

00:07:41.930 --> 00:07:45.639
 certified well is also good as 

00:07:44.000 --> 00:07:48.740
