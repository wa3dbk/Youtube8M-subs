00:00:09.580 --> 00:00:13.809
 follow this tap here again 

00:00:12.639 --> 00:00:15.070
 I do not know exactly how this 

00:00:13.809 --> 00:00:17.200

00:00:15.070 --> 00:00:31.840

00:00:38.019 --> 00:00:42.249
 that just warm a nvidia drivers 

00:00:39.850 --> 00:00:44.199
 he has packed calendars 

00:00:42.249 --> 00:00:46.510
 works great but now we have to 

00:00:44.199 --> 00:00:47.559
 first through is eternally deep hole 

00:00:46.510 --> 00:00:49.210
 flown I hope that I still here 

00:00:47.559 --> 00:00:52.089
 if not then I 'm sorry 

00:00:49.210 --> 00:00:56.079
 but I still hope so here 

00:00:52.089 --> 00:00:57.339
 wonderful is back game over is me 

00:00:56.079 --> 00:00:59.079
 no matter it is not game for me yet 

00:00:57.339 --> 00:01:00.219
 that does not mean anything to me 

00:00:59.079 --> 00:01:02.859
 I want to do that now 

00:01:00.219 --> 00:01:05.650
 bonuslevel make bad game game 

00:01:02.859 --> 00:01:06.760
 mode 1 i give a tick on it me 

00:01:05.650 --> 00:01:07.810
 I did not collect all the diamonds but 

00:01:06.760 --> 00:01:11.350
 I want to show you everything 

00:01:07.810 --> 00:01:15.160
 from this beautiful was at 

00:01:11.350 --> 00:01:19.350
 But dragging is also experimental 

00:01:15.160 --> 00:01:19.350
 level team hot the bonuslevel oh 

00:01:20.820 --> 00:01:23.820
 OK 

00:01:24.050 --> 00:01:27.920
 I have pure generation speed here 

00:01:25.970 --> 00:01:31.460
 okay i have everything i do here 

00:01:27.920 --> 00:01:38.530
 jump me down somewhere or ok 

00:01:31.460 --> 00:01:41.390
 Apparently that's okay 

00:01:38.530 --> 00:01:43.790
 I've got outta here I hate 

00:01:41.390 --> 00:01:45.410
 cobwebs that the biggest shit 

00:01:43.790 --> 00:01:47.690
 In minecraft I give it my opinion 

00:01:45.410 --> 00:01:50.480
 can feather a beautiful fall but it 

00:01:47.690 --> 00:01:54.530
 Just steffi just annoying 

00:01:50.480 --> 00:01:57.950
 steffi where's it going down i hope 

00:01:54.530 --> 00:01:59.450
 maybe there's a cabaret somewhere 

00:01:57.950 --> 00:02:06.980
 generations can jump down everywhere 

00:01:59.450 --> 00:02:09.590
 like a madman like that and where should I go 

00:02:06.980 --> 00:02:14.740
 Now it's best to jump in the front 

00:02:09.590 --> 00:02:14.740
 maybe that was very close 

00:02:14.800 --> 00:02:18.830
 I have to get down safely somehow 

00:02:16.850 --> 00:02:21.710
 come because that's ultra whiskey 

00:02:18.830 --> 00:02:24.350
 what I am doing here already mega 

00:02:21.710 --> 00:02:26.480
 violently risky I think that's one too 

00:02:24.350 --> 00:02:30.709
 whole room here just awkward 

00:02:26.480 --> 00:02:32.770
 is she at least that where I have to 

00:02:30.709 --> 00:02:34.280
 long friends here where I have to long 

00:02:32.770 --> 00:02:37.220
 shampoos I have not 

00:02:34.280 --> 00:02:38.630
 somehow just that stupid annoying 

00:02:37.220 --> 00:02:41.180
 speed will certainly blow me right in the 

00:02:38.630 --> 00:02:47.810
 ruin will drive and will say it 

00:02:41.180 --> 00:02:49.459
 that i really shit off but i shit 

00:02:47.810 --> 00:02:52.150
 I do not know if I'm going to crash here 

00:02:49.459 --> 00:02:52.150
 survive below 

00:02:53.140 --> 00:03:02.300
 super awesome felix then I would 

00:02:59.540 --> 00:03:03.650
 I say down here again 

00:03:02.300 --> 00:03:05.720
 Eighty years are finally over 

00:03:03.650 --> 00:03:08.170

00:03:18.400 --> 00:03:22.670

00:03:22.670 --> 00:03:28.640
 Thank you very much 

00:03:27.530 --> 00:03:29.720
 it could just go down 

00:03:28.640 --> 00:03:35.390
 jump without feeling bad 

00:03:29.720 --> 00:03:38.450
 is not water at all 

00:03:35.390 --> 00:03:41.959
 maybe here for a long time or so 

00:03:38.450 --> 00:03:42.940
 Thank you very much, here I am 

00:03:41.959 --> 00:03:45.020

00:03:42.940 --> 00:03:47.569
 or should i originally from there 

00:03:45.020 --> 00:03:54.319

00:03:54.319 --> 00:03:58.040

00:03:58.040 --> 00:04:07.370
 long ok, I have to go somehow 

00:04:06.170 --> 00:04:10.340
 down there but I do not know if there 

00:04:07.370 --> 00:04:14.410
 down a cobweb is natural 

00:04:10.340 --> 00:04:16.910
 the question of all here long 

00:04:14.410 --> 00:04:22.820
 Somewhere somewhere where I come down 

00:04:16.910 --> 00:04:24.290
 No, nothing, nothing I can see 

00:04:22.820 --> 00:04:25.490

00:04:24.290 --> 00:04:27.430

00:04:25.490 --> 00:04:31.270
 Spider web 

00:04:27.430 --> 00:04:31.270

00:04:47.170 --> 00:04:53.620

00:05:00.990 --> 00:05:11.710
 The tip of the nose is wonderful and here 

00:05:11.050 --> 00:05:15.130
