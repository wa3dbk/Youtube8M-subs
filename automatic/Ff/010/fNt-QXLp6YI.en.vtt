running in the background some other

00:02:17.670 --> 00:02:19.009 
running in the background some other
things<00:02:17.849> have<00:02:17.999> changed<00:02:18.299> too<00:02:18.480> first<00:02:18.749> of<00:02:18.900> all<00:02:18.989> I

00:02:19.009 --> 00:02:19.019 
things have changed too first of all I

00:02:19.019 --> 00:02:20.869 
things have changed too first of all I
found<00:02:19.260> this<00:02:19.530> ROM<00:02:19.829> to<00:02:20.069> be<00:02:20.189> overall<00:02:20.579> a<00:02:20.609> bit

00:02:20.869 --> 00:02:20.879 
found this ROM to be overall a bit

00:02:20.879 --> 00:02:23.720 
found this ROM to be overall a bit
snappier<00:02:21.450> when<00:02:21.780> compared<00:02:22.260> to<00:02:22.349> HTC<00:02:23.129> Sense<00:02:23.430> 5

00:02:23.720 --> 00:02:23.730 
snappier when compared to HTC Sense 5

00:02:23.730 --> 00:02:26.030 
snappier when compared to HTC Sense 5
and<00:02:23.999> Sense<00:02:24.420> 5<00:02:24.569> was<00:02:24.749> already<00:02:25.139> really<00:02:25.469> fast<00:02:25.829> on

00:02:26.030 --> 00:02:26.040 
and Sense 5 was already really fast on

00:02:26.040 --> 00:02:27.619 
and Sense 5 was already really fast on
the<00:02:26.099> regular<00:02:26.430> one<00:02:26.700> I<00:02:26.909> think<00:02:27.180> that's<00:02:27.420> to<00:02:27.510> be

00:02:27.619 --> 00:02:27.629 
the regular one I think that's to be

00:02:27.629 --> 00:02:29.420 
the regular one I think that's to be
expected<00:02:27.689> though<00:02:28.139> by<00:02:28.290> now<00:02:28.469> with<00:02:28.680> AOSP<00:02:29.069> it's

00:02:29.420 --> 00:02:29.430 
expected though by now with AOSP it's

00:02:29.430 --> 00:02:31.250 
expected though by now with AOSP it's
just<00:02:29.639> naturally<00:02:30.239> a<00:02:30.269> bit<00:02:30.510> snappier<00:02:30.989> and<00:02:31.139> more

00:02:31.250 --> 00:02:31.260 
just naturally a bit snappier and more

00:02:31.260 --> 00:02:33.110 
just naturally a bit snappier and more
fluid<00:02:31.650> overall<00:02:32.069> and<00:02:32.280> that's<00:02:32.670> even<00:02:32.939> more

00:02:33.110 --> 00:02:33.120 
fluid overall and that's even more

00:02:33.120 --> 00:02:35.059 
fluid overall and that's even more
apparent<00:02:33.359> with<00:02:33.689> the<00:02:33.810> google<00:02:34.139> edition<00:02:34.500> galaxy

00:02:35.059 --> 00:02:35.069 
apparent with the google edition galaxy

00:02:35.069 --> 00:02:37.339 
apparent with the google edition galaxy
s4<00:02:35.489> when<00:02:35.730> you<00:02:35.819> compare<00:02:36.120> it<00:02:36.209> to<00:02:36.239> TouchWiz<00:02:36.719> and<00:02:36.930> I

00:02:37.339 --> 00:02:37.349 
s4 when you compare it to TouchWiz and I

00:02:37.349 --> 00:02:38.990 
s4 when you compare it to TouchWiz and I
also<00:02:37.469> think<00:02:37.769> that<00:02:37.829> stock<00:02:38.189> Android<00:02:38.609> happens<00:02:38.879> to

00:02:38.990 --> 00:02:39.000 
also think that stock Android happens to

00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:41.179 
also think that stock Android happens to
look<00:02:39.090> really<00:02:39.450> pretty<00:02:39.689> on<00:02:39.959> the<00:02:40.469> black<00:02:40.829> bezel

00:02:41.179 --> 00:02:41.189 
look really pretty on the black bezel

00:02:41.189 --> 00:02:43.190 
look really pretty on the black bezel
around<00:02:41.609> the<00:02:41.760> display<00:02:41.969> I<00:02:42.150> just<00:02:42.480> wish<00:02:42.780> I<00:02:42.959> could

00:02:43.190 --> 00:02:43.200 
around the display I just wish I could

00:02:43.200 --> 00:02:46.069 
around the display I just wish I could
get<00:02:43.349> a<00:02:43.590> black<00:02:43.950> google<00:02:44.459> edition<00:02:44.790> HTC<00:02:45.269> one<00:02:45.510> since

00:02:46.069 --> 00:02:46.079 
get a black google edition HTC one since

00:02:46.079 --> 00:02:48.170 
get a black google edition HTC one since
I<00:02:46.169> think<00:02:46.349> that<00:02:46.469> would<00:02:46.590> look<00:02:46.620> even<00:02:47.159> sexier<00:02:47.639> now

00:02:48.170 --> 00:02:48.180 
I think that would look even sexier now

00:02:48.180 --> 00:02:51.020 
I think that would look even sexier now

or<00:03:19.259> not<00:03:19.319> you<00:03:19.470> decide<00:03:19.560> to<00:03:19.859> use<00:03:20.040> it<00:03:20.189> is<00:03:20.340> up<00:03:20.370> to<00:03:21.090> you

00:03:21.259 --> 00:03:21.269 
or not you decide to use it is up to you

00:03:21.269 --> 00:03:22.699 
or not you decide to use it is up to you
have<00:03:21.629> a<00:03:21.659> listen<00:03:21.989> to<00:03:22.019> the<00:03:22.139> difference<00:03:22.500> in<00:03:22.620> the

00:03:47.540 --> 00:03:47.550 

00:03:47.550 --> 00:03:49.860 

so<00:03:48.550> beatsaudio<00:03:49.000> is<00:03:49.300> still<00:03:49.510> in<00:03:49.630> full<00:03:49.750> effect

00:03:53.650 --> 00:03:54.480 
to avoid all the suppressions that come
with<00:03:53.800> turning<00:03:54.070> it<00:03:54.130> off

00:03:54.480 --> 00:03:54.490 
with turning it off

00:03:54.490 --> 00:03:56.010

the Google Edition ones hardware like

00:04:34.180 --> 00:04:36.330

but<00:04:41.380> the<00:04:41.470> images<00:04:41.860> you'll<00:04:42.040> be<00:04:42.160> able<00:04:42.250> to<00:04:42.400> take

00:04:42.570 --> 00:04:42.580 
but the images you'll be able to take

00:04:42.580 --> 00:04:44.160 
but the images you'll be able to take
will<00:04:42.760> look<00:04:42.940> exactly<00:04:43.270> the<00:04:43.570> same<00:04:43.780> so<00:04:43.990> you'll<00:04:44.110> be

00:04:44.160 --> 00:04:44.170 
will look exactly the same so you'll be

00:04:44.170 --> 00:04:46.110 
will look exactly the same so you'll be

00:04:49.920 --> 00:04:49.930 
with Google software and it'll have the

00:04:49.930 --> 00:04:52.620

same<00:04:50.140> quality<00:04:50.590> as<00:04:50.740> a<00:04:50.770> regular<00:04:51.220> HTC<00:04:51.760> One<00:04:51.970> so<00:04:52.540> of

00:04:52.620 --> 00:04:52.630 
same quality as a regular HTC One so of

00:04:52.630 --> 00:04:53.880 
same quality as a regular HTC One so of
course<00:04:52.840> you're<00:04:52.930> going<00:04:53.020> to<00:04:53.110> be<00:04:53.170> missing<00:04:53.590> all<00:04:53.770> of

00:04:53.880 --> 00:04:53.890 
course you're going to be missing all of

00:04:53.890 --> 00:04:56.010 
course you're going to be missing all of
HTC's<00:04:54.400> extra<00:04:54.820> little<00:04:55.000> camera<00:04:55.360> features<00:04:55.720> like

00:04:56.010 --> 00:04:56.020 
HTC's extra little camera features like

00:04:56.020 --> 00:04:58.920 
HTC's extra little camera features like
Zowie<00:04:56.440> and<00:04:56.800> the<00:04:57.370> effects<00:04:57.940> and<00:04:58.180> live<00:04:58.420> filters

00:04:58.920 --> 00:04:58.930 
Zowie and the effects and live filters

00:04:58.930 --> 00:05:00.840 
Zowie and the effects and live filters
but<00:04:59.410> overall<00:04:59.620> it<00:04:59.860> is<00:04:59.890> very<00:05:00.220> fast<00:05:00.580> and

00:05:00.840 --> 00:05:00.850 
but overall it is very fast and

00:05:00.850 --> 00:05:02.310 
but overall it is very fast and
definitely<00:05:01.210> not<00:05:01.420> a<00:05:01.480> bad<00:05:01.840> quick

00:05:02.310 --> 00:05:02.320 
definitely not a bad quick

00:05:02.320 --> 00:05:04.080 
definitely not a bad quick
point-and-shoot<00:05:02.890> camera<00:05:03.310> for<00:05:03.760> just<00:05:03.790> the

00:05:04.080 --> 00:05:04.090 
point-and-shoot camera for just the

00:05:04.090 --> 00:05:06.420 
point-and-shoot camera for just the
regular<00:05:04.420> photo<00:05:04.900> taking<00:05:05.290> experience<00:05:05.830> so<00:05:06.400> I

00:05:06.420 --> 00:05:06.430 
regular photo taking experience so I

00:05:06.430 --> 00:05:07.740 
regular photo taking experience so I
think<00:05:06.520> it's<00:05:06.760> pretty<00:05:07.000> obvious<00:05:07.060> by<00:05:07.480> now<00:05:07.630> I

00:05:07.740 --> 00:05:07.750 
think it's pretty obvious by now I

00:05:07.750 --> 00:05:10.140 
think it's pretty obvious by now I
really<00:05:08.350> like<00:05:08.620> stock<00:05:08.980> Android<00:05:09.490> I<00:05:09.640> like<00:05:09.880> the<00:05:10.030> way

00:05:10.140 --> 00:05:10.150 
really like stock Android I like the way

00:05:10.150 --> 00:05:12.240 
really like stock Android I like the way
it<00:05:10.270> looks<00:05:10.510> and<00:05:10.690> I<00:05:10.990> prefer<00:05:11.350> it<00:05:11.470> over<00:05:11.560> sense<00:05:12.040> in

00:05:12.240 --> 00:05:12.250 
it looks and I prefer it over sense in

00:05:12.250 --> 00:05:13.860 
it looks and I prefer it over sense in
just<00:05:12.550> the<00:05:12.700> way<00:05:12.820> it<00:05:12.910> operates<00:05:13.060> and<00:05:13.540> I<00:05:13.600> like<00:05:13.750> how

00:05:13.860 --> 00:05:13.870 
just the way it operates and I like how

00:05:13.870 --> 00:05:15.810 
just the way it operates and I like how
quick<00:05:14.140> and<00:05:14.260> responsive<00:05:14.380> it<00:05:14.800> is<00:05:14.860> on<00:05:15.160> hardware

00:05:15.810 --> 00:05:15.820 
quick and responsive it is on hardware

00:05:15.820 --> 00:05:17.760 
quick and responsive it is on hardware
that<00:05:15.850> is<00:05:16.060> optimized<00:05:16.510> for<00:05:16.540> and<00:05:17.020> as<00:05:17.470> Google

00:05:17.760 --> 00:05:17.770 
that is optimized for and as Google

00:05:17.770 --> 00:05:20.220 
that is optimized for and as Google
addition<00:05:18.160> isn't<00:05:18.670> just<00:05:19.000> a<00:05:19.090> regular<00:05:19.300> HTC<00:05:19.990> one

00:05:20.220 --> 00:05:20.230 
addition isn't just a regular HTC one

00:05:20.230 --> 00:05:21.960 
addition isn't just a regular HTC one
with<00:05:20.410> pure<00:05:20.650> Android<00:05:21.040> on<00:05:21.160> top<00:05:21.340> of<00:05:21.520> it<00:05:21.640> it

00:05:21.960 --> 00:05:21.970 
with pure Android on top of it it

00:05:21.970 --> 00:05:23.580 
with pure Android on top of it it
actually<00:05:22.120> has<00:05:22.420> quite<00:05:22.660> a<00:05:22.780> few<00:05:22.990> tweaks<00:05:23.350> and

00:05:23.580 --> 00:05:23.590 
actually has quite a few tweaks and

00:05:23.590 --> 00:05:25.500 
actually has quite a few tweaks and
adjustments<00:05:23.680> behind<00:05:24.430> the<00:05:24.520> scenes<00:05:24.760> to<00:05:25.210> make<00:05:25.390> it

00:05:25.500 --> 00:05:25.510 
adjustments behind the scenes to make it

00:05:25.510 --> 00:05:27.960 
adjustments behind the scenes to make it
work<00:05:25.750> for<00:05:26.320> the<00:05:26.530> one<00:05:26.770> the<00:05:27.250> button<00:05:27.520> layout<00:05:27.760> is<00:05:27.940> a

00:05:27.960 --> 00:05:27.970 
work for the one the button layout is a

00:05:27.970 --> 00:05:29.700 
work for the one the button layout is a
good<00:05:28.150> example<00:05:28.270> on<00:05:28.660> the<00:05:28.750> bottom<00:05:29.080> it's<00:05:29.290> not<00:05:29.410> on

the<00:05:55.790> Google<00:05:56.090> Edition<00:05:56.420> hdc1<00:05:56.960> there<00:05:57.650> were<00:05:57.800> some

00:05:57.970 --> 00:05:57.980 
the Google Edition hdc1 there were some

00:05:57.980 --> 00:05:59.320 
the Google Edition hdc1 there were some
initial<00:05:58.100> concerns<00:05:58.610> about<00:05:58.760> whether<00:05:59.090> or<00:05:59.270> not

00:05:59.320 --> 00:05:59.330 
initial concerns about whether or not

00:05:59.330 --> 00:06:01.270 
initial concerns about whether or not
stock<00:05:59.750> Android<00:06:00.170> would<00:06:00.320> run<00:06:00.500> fine<00:06:00.770> on<00:06:00.950> it<00:06:01.100> but

00:06:01.270 --> 00:06:01.280 
stock Android would run fine on it but

00:06:01.280 --> 00:06:03.250 
stock Android would run fine on it but
like<00:06:01.430> we<00:06:01.550> said<00:06:01.730> there<00:06:01.910> are<00:06:02.060> some<00:06:02.360> little

00:06:03.250 --> 00:06:03.260 
like we said there are some little

00:06:03.260 --> 00:06:04.990 
like we said there are some little
behind<00:06:03.590> the<00:06:03.710> scenes<00:06:03.920> improvements<00:06:04.550> to<00:06:04.760> stock

00:06:04.990 --> 00:06:05.000 
behind the scenes improvements to stock

00:06:05.000 --> 00:06:06.820 
behind the scenes improvements to stock
Android<00:06:05.360> that<00:06:05.840> make<00:06:05.990> this<00:06:06.140> run<00:06:06.350> really<00:06:06.800> well

00:06:06.820 --> 00:06:06.830 
Android that make this run really well

00:06:06.830 --> 00:06:09.490 
Android that make this run really well
on<00:06:07.340> the<00:06:07.550> one<00:06:07.790> it's<00:06:08.480> not<00:06:08.570> a<00:06:08.630> nexus<00:06:09.020> obviously

00:06:09.490 --> 00:06:09.500 
on the one it's not a nexus obviously

00:06:09.500 --> 00:06:10.870 
on the one it's not a nexus obviously
because<00:06:09.770> of<00:06:09.920> those<00:06:10.100> you<00:06:10.340> know<00:06:10.370> hardware

00:06:10.870 --> 00:06:10.880 
because of those you know hardware

00:06:10.880 --> 00:06:12.070 
because of those you know hardware
button<00:06:11.150> layouts<00:06:11.480> and<00:06:11.720> it's<00:06:11.840> slightly

00:06:12.070 --> 00:06:12.080 
button layouts and it's slightly

00:06:12.080 --> 00:06:13.720 
button layouts and it's slightly
different<00:06:12.350> because<00:06:12.680> there's<00:06:12.860> no<00:06:13.130> on-screen

00:06:13.720 --> 00:06:13.730 
different because there's no on-screen

00:06:13.730 --> 00:06:15.310 
different because there's no on-screen
buttons<00:06:14.090> but<00:06:14.600> I<00:06:14.630> figure<00:06:14.900> this<00:06:15.050> would<00:06:15.200> be<00:06:15.290> a

00:06:15.310 --> 00:06:15.320 
buttons but I figure this would be a

00:06:15.320 --> 00:06:17.070 
buttons but I figure this would be a
good<00:06:15.530> chance<00:06:15.800> to<00:06:15.860> take<00:06:16.040> a<00:06:16.100> look<00:06:16.310> at<00:06:16.490> what

00:06:17.070 --> 00:06:17.080 
good chance to take a look at what

00:06:17.080 --> 00:06:19.690 
good chance to take a look at what
native<00:06:18.080> stock<00:06:18.410> Android<00:06:18.920> basically<00:06:19.490> would

00:06:19.690 --> 00:06:19.700 
native stock Android basically would

00:06:19.700 --> 00:06:21.820 
native stock Android basically would
look<00:06:19.910> like<00:06:20.120> on<00:06:20.390> a<00:06:20.450> phone<00:06:21.230> when<00:06:21.560> it's<00:06:21.680> not

00:06:21.820 --> 00:06:21.830 
look like on a phone when it's not

00:06:21.830 --> 00:06:23.770 
look like on a phone when it's not
CyanogenMod<00:06:22.490> or<00:06:22.700> anything<00:06:22.880> like<00:06:23.060> that<00:06:23.120> now

00:06:23.770 --> 00:06:23.780 
CyanogenMod or anything like that now

00:06:23.780 --> 00:06:25.420 
CyanogenMod or anything like that now
you<00:06:23.840> can<00:06:24.050> also<00:06:24.170> download<00:06:24.470> a<00:06:24.830> Google<00:06:25.130> Edition
