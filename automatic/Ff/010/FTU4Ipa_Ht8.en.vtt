00:02:25.590 --> 00:02:26.960 
already prepared it's already been
fermenting<00:02:26.070> for<00:02:26.070> a<00:02:26.280> while<00:02:26.430> but<00:02:26.610> the<00:02:26.730> thing<00:02:26.940> is

00:02:26.960 --> 00:02:26.970 
fermenting for a while but the thing is

00:02:26.970 --> 00:02:31.880 
fermenting for a while but the thing is
that<00:02:27.120> these<00:02:28.640> critters<00:02:30.020> create<00:02:31.020> really<00:02:31.680> good

00:02:31.880 --> 00:02:31.890 
that these critters create really good

00:02:31.890 --> 00:02:35.180 
that these critters create really good
really<00:02:32.540> beneficial<00:02:33.540> bacteria<00:02:33.950> for<00:02:34.950> your<00:02:35.070> body

00:02:35.180 --> 00:02:35.190 
really beneficial bacteria for your body

00:02:35.190 --> 00:02:38.630 
really beneficial bacteria for your body
and<00:02:35.610> they<00:02:36.090> eat<00:02:36.270> the<00:02:36.420> sugar<00:02:37.160> now<00:02:38.160> this<00:02:38.400> right

00:02:38.630 --> 00:02:38.640 
and they eat the sugar now this right

00:02:38.640 --> 00:02:40.790 
and they eat the sugar now this right
here<00:02:38.700> is<00:02:38.910> some<00:02:39.660> lacto-fermented<00:02:40.020> berries

00:02:40.790 --> 00:02:40.800 
here is some lacto-fermented berries

00:02:40.800 --> 00:02:45.050 
here is some lacto-fermented berries
those<00:02:41.730> are<00:02:41.880> fermented<00:02:42.090> with<00:02:42.330> way<00:02:42.570> and<00:02:43.850> so<00:02:44.850> the

00:02:45.050 --> 00:02:45.060 
those are fermented with way and so the

00:02:45.060 --> 00:02:46.280 
those are fermented with way and so the
sugar<00:02:45.420> there's<00:02:45.810> a<00:02:45.870> little<00:02:45.960> bit<00:02:46.080> of<00:02:46.140> maple

00:02:46.280 --> 00:02:46.290 
sugar there's a little bit of maple

00:02:46.290 --> 00:02:47.810 
sugar there's a little bit of maple
syrup<00:02:46.470> in<00:02:46.800> there<00:02:46.950> too<00:02:47.130> but<00:02:47.280> it's<00:02:47.430> not<00:02:47.610> it's

00:02:47.810 --> 00:02:47.820 
syrup in there too but it's not it's

00:02:47.820 --> 00:02:49.550 
syrup in there too but it's not it's
actually<00:02:48.300> tart<00:02:48.750> now<00:02:48.900> it<00:02:49.080> was<00:02:49.200> pretty<00:02:49.380> sweet

00:02:49.550 --> 00:02:49.560 
actually tart now it was pretty sweet

00:02:49.560 --> 00:02:52.040 
actually tart now it was pretty sweet
when<00:02:49.740> I<00:02:49.770> started<00:02:50.130> but<00:02:50.250> the<00:02:50.660> Beasties<00:02:51.660> eat<00:02:51.870> the

00:02:52.040 --> 00:02:52.050 
when I started but the Beasties eat the

00:02:52.050 --> 00:02:54.440 
when I started but the Beasties eat the
sugar<00:02:52.580> you<00:02:53.580> know<00:02:53.670> this<00:02:53.970> one<00:02:54.150> is<00:02:54.270> still<00:02:54.360> a

00:02:54.440 --> 00:02:54.450 
sugar you know this one is still a

00:02:54.450 --> 00:02:55.760 
sugar you know this one is still a
little<00:02:54.660> bit<00:02:54.870> sweet<00:02:55.080> so<00:02:55.260> I<00:02:55.320> know<00:02:55.380> there's<00:02:55.650> still

00:02:55.760 --> 00:02:55.770 
little bit sweet so I know there's still

00:02:55.770 --> 00:02:59.780 
little bit sweet so I know there's still
some<00:02:56.070> sugar<00:02:56.310> in<00:02:56.400> it<00:02:56.610> but<00:02:58.430> that's<00:02:59.430> what<00:02:59.580> made<00:02:59.760> me

00:02:59.780 --> 00:02:59.790 
some sugar in it but that's what made me

00:02:59.790 --> 00:03:02.150 
some sugar in it but that's what made me
think<00:02:59.910> Oh<00:03:00.210> women<00:03:00.630> add<00:03:00.840> some<00:03:01.050> cream<00:03:01.320> because<00:03:01.890> we

00:03:02.150 --> 00:03:02.160 
think Oh women add some cream because we

00:03:02.160 --> 00:03:04.000 
think Oh women add some cream because we
know<00:03:02.280> that<00:03:02.520> when<00:03:02.610> we<00:03:02.730> add<00:03:02.940> fat<00:03:03.300> or<00:03:03.660> sugar

00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:04.010 
know that when we add fat or sugar

00:03:04.010 --> 00:03:07.010 
know that when we add fat or sugar
intake<00:03:05.010> you<00:03:05.550> can<00:03:05.730> slow<00:03:06.060> down<00:03:06.240> it<00:03:06.540> just<00:03:06.810> sort<00:03:06.960> of

00:03:07.010 --> 00:03:07.020 
intake you can slow down it just sort of

00:03:07.020 --> 00:03:08.900 
intake you can slow down it just sort of
evens<00:03:07.350> out<00:03:07.500> our<00:03:07.740> bodies<00:03:08.100> use<00:03:08.130> of<00:03:08.580> the<00:03:08.670> sugar

00:03:08.900 --> 00:03:08.910 
evens out our bodies use of the sugar

00:03:08.910 --> 00:03:12.080 
evens out our bodies use of the sugar
and<00:03:09.000> you<00:03:09.210> don't<00:03:09.390> get<00:03:09.950> out<00:03:10.950> of<00:03:11.310> range<00:03:11.520> peaks<00:03:11.880> in

00:03:12.080 --> 00:03:12.090 
and you don't get out of range peaks in

00:03:12.090 --> 00:03:14.720 
and you don't get out of range peaks in
our<00:03:12.210> blood<00:03:12.390> sugar<00:03:12.630> and<00:03:12.870> then<00:03:13.380> plummets<00:03:13.980> where

00:03:14.720 --> 00:03:14.730 
our blood sugar and then plummets where

00:03:14.730 --> 00:03:18.320 
our blood sugar and then plummets where
we<00:03:14.820> feel<00:03:14.970> horrible<00:03:15.330> after<00:03:15.720> so<00:03:16.500> um<00:03:16.880> so<00:03:17.880> all<00:03:18.120> I've

00:03:18.320 --> 00:03:18.330
