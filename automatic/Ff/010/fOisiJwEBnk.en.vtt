00:01:18.710 --> 00:01:18.720 
there so what I ended up doing with mine

00:01:18.720 --> 00:01:23.210 
there so what I ended up doing with mine
is<00:01:19.229> I<00:01:20.210> get<00:01:21.210> these<00:01:21.390> glass<00:01:21.750> tiles<00:01:22.259> from<00:01:22.439> etsy<00:01:22.920> I

00:01:23.210 --> 00:01:23.220 
is I get these glass tiles from etsy I

00:01:23.220 --> 00:01:25.820 
is I get these glass tiles from etsy I
think<00:01:23.880> this<00:01:24.000> is<00:01:24.210> probably<00:01:24.479> about<00:01:24.780> two<00:01:25.350> and<00:01:25.740> a

00:01:25.820 --> 00:01:25.830 
think this is probably about two and a

00:01:25.830 --> 00:01:29.270 
think this is probably about two and a
half<00:01:25.860> inches<00:01:26.189> three<00:01:26.790> inches<00:01:26.820> and<00:01:27.890> they<00:01:28.890> happen

00:01:29.270 --> 00:01:29.280 
half inches three inches and they happen

00:01:29.280 --> 00:01:32.289 
half inches three inches and they happen
to<00:01:29.310> fit<00:01:29.670> perfectly<00:01:30.570> in<00:01:31.079> the<00:01:31.380> setting<00:01:31.860> for

00:01:32.289 --> 00:01:32.299 
to fit perfectly in the setting for

00:01:32.299 --> 00:01:40.670 
to fit perfectly in the setting for
these<00:01:33.890> so<00:01:34.890> what<00:01:35.729> I<00:01:35.759> did<00:01:37.040> with<00:01:38.040> this<00:01:38.280> one<00:01:39.500> as<00:01:40.500> I

00:01:40.670 --> 00:01:40.680 
these so what I did with this one as I

00:01:40.680 --> 00:01:42.770 
these so what I did with this one as I
made<00:01:40.890> this<00:01:41.130> just<00:01:41.579> using<00:01:42.000> a<00:01:42.090> scrap<00:01:42.509> of
