00:02:55.860 --> 00:02:55.870 
is the power supply fan and you might

00:02:55.870 --> 00:02:58.229 
is the power supply fan and you might
think<00:02:56.110> oh<00:02:56.350> it's<00:02:57.130> actually<00:02:57.430> not<00:02:57.580> making<00:02:57.940> that

00:02:58.229 --> 00:02:58.239 
think oh it's actually not making that

00:02:58.239 --> 00:03:03.180 
think oh it's actually not making that
much<00:02:58.480> noise<00:02:59.850> but<00:03:01.290> relatively<00:03:02.290> compared<00:03:03.069> to

00:03:03.180 --> 00:03:03.190 
much noise but relatively compared to

00:03:03.190 --> 00:03:07.490 
much noise but relatively compared to
how<00:03:03.310> quiet<00:03:03.610> it<00:03:03.790> is<00:03:04.120> and<00:03:04.540> in<00:03:04.989> a<00:03:05.340> silent<00:03:06.340> room<00:03:06.549> I

00:03:07.490 --> 00:03:07.500 
how quiet it is and in a silent room I

00:03:07.500 --> 00:03:12.509 
how quiet it is and in a silent room I
mean<00:03:08.500> it's<00:03:08.709> only<00:03:08.950> playing<00:03:09.519> Minecraft<00:03:11.519> either

00:03:12.509 --> 00:03:12.519 
mean it's only playing Minecraft either

00:03:12.519 --> 00:03:13.949 
mean it's only playing Minecraft either
way<00:03:12.760> it<00:03:12.880> shouldn't<00:03:13.120> be<00:03:13.239> making<00:03:13.390> that<00:03:13.690> much

00:03:13.949 --> 00:03:13.959 
way it shouldn't be making that much

00:03:13.959 --> 00:03:16.140 
way it shouldn't be making that much
noise<00:03:14.220> yeah<00:03:15.220> the<00:03:15.400> fun<00:03:15.610> speech<00:03:15.910> should

00:03:16.140 --> 00:03:16.150 
noise yeah the fun speech should

00:03:16.150 --> 00:03:18.660 
noise yeah the fun speech should
increase<00:03:16.450> from<00:03:16.690> like<00:03:16.870> 40<00:03:17.380> percent<00:03:17.709> to<00:03:17.799> like<00:03:18.010> 60

00:03:18.660 --> 00:03:18.670 
increase from like 40 percent to like 60

00:03:18.670 --> 00:03:22.949 
increase from like 40 percent to like 60
percent<00:03:20.340> but<00:03:21.340> it<00:03:21.459> like<00:03:21.640> it<00:03:21.970> just<00:03:22.150> goes<00:03:22.480> to<00:03:22.840> this

00:03:22.949 --> 00:03:22.959 
percent but it like it just goes to this

00:03:22.959 --> 00:03:27.240 
percent but it like it just goes to this
level<00:03:23.829> where<00:03:24.010> it's<00:03:24.160> not<00:03:24.310> needed<00:03:24.959> and<00:03:26.250> the

00:03:27.240 --> 00:03:27.250 
level where it's not needed and the

00:03:27.250 --> 00:03:29.550 
level where it's not needed and the
replacement<00:03:28.060> for<00:03:28.299> it<00:03:28.420> I'm<00:03:28.810> gonna<00:03:29.049> get<00:03:29.260> a<00:03:29.290> C

00:03:29.550 --> 00:03:29.560 
replacement for it I'm gonna get a C

00:03:29.560 --> 00:03:32.039 
replacement for it I'm gonna get a C
sonic<00:03:29.920> 1<00:03:30.130> which<00:03:30.370> is<00:03:30.489> already<00:03:30.700> on<00:03:30.790> the<00:03:30.970> way<00:03:31.120> and

00:03:32.039 --> 00:03:32.049 
sonic 1 which is already on the way and

00:03:32.049 --> 00:03:37.890 
sonic 1 which is already on the way and
that<00:03:32.079> costs<00:03:32.970> 210<00:03:33.970> pounds<00:03:34.480> this<00:03:34.690> costs<00:03:34.989> 80<00:03:36.900> so

00:03:37.890 --> 00:03:37.900 
that costs 210 pounds this costs 80 so

00:03:37.900 --> 00:03:40.560 
that costs 210 pounds this costs 80 so
yeah<00:03:38.049> that<00:03:38.200> kind<00:03:38.410> of<00:03:38.470> sucks<00:03:39.480> considering<00:03:40.480> I

00:03:40.560 --> 00:03:40.570 
yeah that kind of sucks considering I

00:03:40.570 --> 00:03:42.690 
yeah that kind of sucks considering I
still<00:03:40.840> have<00:03:41.019> to<00:03:41.140> sell<00:03:41.380> off<00:03:41.500> this<00:03:41.680> one<00:03:41.950> so<00:03:42.640> I'm

silent not cheap and on the side here to
take<00:04:17.489> away<00:04:17.730> the<00:04:17.850> heats<00:04:18.090> from<00:04:18.299> the<00:04:18.480> graphics

00:04:18.860 --> 00:04:18.870 
take away the heats from the graphics

00:04:18.870 --> 00:04:22.310 
take away the heats from the graphics
card<00:04:19.140> just<00:04:19.650> quite<00:04:19.859> significant<00:04:20.549> I<00:04:21.169> mean<00:04:22.169> that

00:04:22.310 --> 00:04:22.320 
card just quite significant I mean that

00:04:22.320 --> 00:04:23.780 
card just quite significant I mean that
graphic<00:04:22.740> card<00:04:22.919> by<00:04:23.070> itself<00:04:23.310> has<00:04:23.520> just

00:04:23.780 --> 00:04:23.790 
graphic card by itself has just

00:04:23.790 --> 00:04:26.740 
graphic card by itself has just
increased<00:04:24.000> the<00:04:24.450> heat<00:04:24.720> and<00:04:24.960> my<00:04:25.080> PC<00:04:25.530> by<00:04:25.740> light<00:04:25.980> in

00:04:26.740 --> 00:04:26.750 
increased the heat and my PC by light in

00:04:26.750 --> 00:04:32.510 
increased the heat and my PC by light in
10<00:04:27.750> degrees<00:04:29.180> SSD<00:04:30.180> another<00:04:30.630> firm<00:04:31.190> is<00:04:32.190> another

00:04:32.510 --> 00:04:32.520 
10 degrees SSD another firm is another

00:04:32.520 --> 00:04:33.890 
10 degrees SSD another firm is another
fan<00:04:32.850> in<00:04:33.000> the<00:04:33.090> front<00:04:33.390> there<00:04:33.600> which<00:04:33.750> I'm

00:04:33.890 --> 00:04:33.900 
fan in the front there which I'm

00:04:33.900 --> 00:04:36.050 
fan in the front there which I'm
guessing<00:04:34.169> amounted<00:04:34.830> not<00:04:35.580> a<00:04:35.610> fan<00:04:35.910> at<00:04:36.030> the

00:04:36.050 --> 00:04:36.060 
guessing amounted not a fan at the

00:04:36.060 --> 00:04:38.360 
guessing amounted not a fan at the
thought<00:04:36.390> it's<00:04:37.050> a<00:04:37.110> lot<00:04:37.260> of<00:04:37.290> funds<00:04:37.590> you<00:04:38.130> got<00:04:38.280> an

00:04:38.360 --> 00:04:38.370 
thought it's a lot of funds you got an

00:04:38.370 --> 00:04:41.630 
thought it's a lot of funds you got an
idea<00:04:39.290> 16<00:04:40.290> gigabytes<00:04:40.710> of<00:04:40.830> RAM<00:04:41.100> but<00:04:41.130> I'll<00:04:41.460> do<00:04:41.610> a

00:04:41.630 --> 00:04:41.640 
idea 16 gigabytes of RAM but I'll do a

00:04:41.640 --> 00:04:45.320 
idea 16 gigabytes of RAM but I'll do a
proper<00:04:42.060> review<00:04:42.990> of<00:04:43.290> my<00:04:43.410> PC<00:04:43.830> later<00:04:44.330> component

00:04:45.320 --> 00:04:45.330 
proper review of my PC later component

00:04:45.330 --> 00:04:48.620 
proper review of my PC later component
by<00:04:45.419> component<00:04:45.830> like<00:04:46.830> I<00:04:46.950> said<00:04:47.190> I<00:04:47.220> would<00:04:47.630> anyway

00:04:48.620 --> 00:04:48.630 
by component like I said I would anyway

00:04:48.630 --> 00:04:51.020 
by component like I said I would anyway
that's<00:04:48.870> me<00:04:49.020> signing<00:04:49.380> out<00:04:49.500> and<00:04:49.770> remember<00:04:50.700> do

00:04:51.020 --> 00:04:51.030 
that's me signing out and remember do

00:04:51.030 --> 00:04:55.669 
that's me signing out and remember do
not<00:04:51.060> buy<00:04:51.630> this<00:04:51.840> power<00:04:52.050> supply<00:04:52.410> it<00:04:53.190> sucks
