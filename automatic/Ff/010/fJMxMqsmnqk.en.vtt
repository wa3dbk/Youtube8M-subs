00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.200
 It has been the most enjoyable time with 

00:00:02.550 --> 00:00:07.480
 nucleus 

00:00:04.200 --> 00:00:10.300

00:00:07.480 --> 00:00:15.190
 see my son 

00:00:10.300 --> 00:00:17.500
 I started pgb because it was his dream of him the 

00:00:15.190 --> 00:00:22.180
 Little boy at nine ten years old he 

00:00:17.500 --> 00:00:24.640
 he recorded only he said mommy because those 

00:00:22.180 --> 00:00:28.620
 people to make laugh earn money and 

00:00:24.640 --> 00:00:30.900
 they are paid, I want to be like them 

00:00:28.620 --> 00:00:32.760
 and alone he starts singing and records 

00:00:30.900 --> 00:00:35.370
 just in the mirror and said I'm going to be 

00:00:32.760 --> 00:00:37.440

00:00:42.330 --> 00:00:47.370

00:00:44.130 --> 00:00:52.530

00:01:12.060 --> 00:01:19.159
 God willing, not what you look at now 

00:01:15.150 --> 00:01:19.159

00:01:22.760 --> 00:01:28.370
 well it came true but I 

00:01:25.610 --> 00:01:30.550
 I also said this first one I finished the 

00:01:28.370 --> 00:01:33.790
 career is not going to leave me the race for 

00:01:30.550 --> 00:01:36.950

00:01:33.790 --> 00:01:40.700
 and many people realized how 

00:01:36.950 --> 00:01:42.400
 He came out with his bags under his eyes because he was studying 

00:01:40.700 --> 00:01:45.190
 night 

00:01:42.400 --> 00:01:48.070

00:01:45.190 --> 00:01:52.510
 also that he said it why the bags 

00:01:48.070 --> 00:01:54.850
 what did you have because if you see him more 

00:01:52.510 --> 00:01:58.900
 I thought it was because of crying 

00:01:54.850 --> 00:02:01.480

00:01:58.900 --> 00:02:03.340
