 pretty reliable portal within the world 

00:00:22.850 --> 00:00:28.039
 of video games which says that the 

00:00:25.039 --> 00:00:30.890
 prediction 4 will have 50% more than 

00:00:28.039 --> 00:00:33.920
 brute power that the now the xbox but 

00:00:30.890 --> 00:00:36.769
 in the xbox 620 will have more ram memory 

00:00:33.920 --> 00:00:40.909
 that playstation 4 already know the 

00:00:36.769 --> 00:00:42.530
 known portal vg247 has published a 

00:00:40.909 --> 00:00:45.229
 article that said that 

00:00:42.530 --> 00:00:47.329
 an anonymous source has revealed to you that 

00:00:45.229 --> 00:00:50.059
 the next playstation 4 next 

00:00:47.329 --> 00:00:53.809
 generation will have 50% more power 

00:00:50.059 --> 00:00:55.579
 gross that the successor of xbox 360 in 

00:00:53.809 --> 00:00:58.280
 concrete and according to your report this 

00:00:55.579 --> 00:01:00.469
 information that they attribute to an event 

00:00:58.280 --> 00:01:03.170
 private that occurred in the ces 2013 

00:01:00.469 --> 00:01:05.070
 where playstation 4 will have 184 

00:01:03.170 --> 00:01:09.860
 teraflops 

00:01:05.070 --> 00:01:13.350
 in the xbox 720 would have 124 teraflops 

00:01:09.860 --> 00:01:15.840
 this is to say that a flop is one 

00:01:13.350 --> 00:01:19.950
 more is a floating point operation 

00:01:15.840 --> 00:01:23.550
 per second they also indicate that the new 

00:01:19.950 --> 00:01:25.830
 Xbox will watch all 8 gb of ram 

00:01:23.550 --> 00:01:27.690
 which 3 will be reserved for 

00:01:25.830 --> 00:01:30.390
 operating system applications and 

00:01:27.690 --> 00:01:32.580
 security so that they would be between 4 

00:01:30.390 --> 00:01:36.030
 and 5 gigabytes for games 

00:01:32.580 --> 00:01:38.250
 playstation 4 on the other hand would have 4 GB 

00:01:36.030 --> 00:01:41.190
 of ram and only one giga would be destined 

00:01:38.250 --> 00:01:43.860
 to the operating system security and apps is 

00:01:41.190 --> 00:01:46.350
 so there would be 3 gigabytes for 

00:01:43.860 --> 00:01:50.009
 the games in addition both platforms 

00:01:46.350 --> 00:01:53.039
 they would support bluray of up to 100 GB and 

00:01:50.009 --> 00:01:56.039
 Playstation 4 would be built from 

00:01:53.039 --> 00:02:00.259
 a graph to 10 apu of amd and the next 

00:01:56.039 --> 00:02:03.570
 xbox 720 would have a radeon hd graphic 

00:02:00.259 --> 00:02:06.660
 8.770 gpu so with these data guys 

00:02:03.570 --> 00:02:10.670
 and with these rumors we can say that the 

00:02:06.660 --> 00:02:12.590
 xbox 720 would have more ram memory 

00:02:10.670 --> 00:02:14.360
 in playstation 4 but in the 

00:02:12.590 --> 00:02:17.540
 playstation how much would have more power 

00:02:14.360 --> 00:02:20.420
 gross in terms of talking about teraflops 

00:02:17.540 --> 00:02:23.090
 so with this data with this rumor 

00:02:20.420 --> 00:02:25.330
 I want you to tell me what bolt 

00:02:23.090 --> 00:02:28.740
 more powerful consulates in the sense of 

00:02:25.330 --> 00:02:32.510
 better more ram memory 

00:02:28.740 --> 00:02:34.860
 and more gross power so you know 

00:02:32.510 --> 00:02:36.840
 I think it's going to happen like this 

00:02:34.860 --> 00:02:39.090
 generation is worth in which the 

00:02:36.840 --> 00:02:42.180
 playstation3 in exclusive games 

00:02:39.090 --> 00:02:44.850
 as heavy rain what is to come is 

00:02:42.180 --> 00:02:46.620
 of the all the last of us' and very many 

00:02:44.850 --> 00:02:49.880
 but heavy rain is for me a ship 

00:02:46.620 --> 00:02:52.190
 badge in terms of graphics worth 

00:02:49.880 --> 00:02:54.770
 it makes a big difference but it's a 

00:02:52.190 --> 00:02:57.620
 game is worth an exclusive game worth but 

00:02:54.770 --> 00:03:00.260
 the xbox 360 in general all modes 

00:02:57.620 --> 00:03:02.390
 multiplatform run much better 

00:03:00.260 --> 00:03:05.270
 because that's why not for the graphic memory 

00:03:02.390 --> 00:03:06.740
 ok that the playstation3 is worth so 

00:03:05.270 --> 00:03:08.510
 So much you think that the same thing will happen 

00:03:06.740 --> 00:03:10.880
 in the next generation worth going to have 

00:03:08.510 --> 00:03:13.820
 more is more is going to be better to have more 

00:03:10.880 --> 00:03:17.270
 graphic power in terms of consoles 

00:03:13.820 --> 00:03:19.550
 are more or better or more ram memory will be 

00:03:17.270 --> 00:03:21.530
 better I want you to tell me what to tell 

00:03:19.550 --> 00:03:23.300
 your opinion guys and you already know like 

00:03:21.530 --> 00:03:25.720
 and favorites to comment and see you in the 

00:03:23.300 --> 00:03:25.720
