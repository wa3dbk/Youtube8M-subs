00:00:42.799 --> 00:00:42.809 
and i just found this if you have iOS 7

00:00:42.809 --> 00:00:46.369 
and i just found this if you have iOS 7
jailbreak<00:00:44.600> switch<00:00:45.600> for<00:00:45.809> that<00:00:45.930> so<00:00:46.260> you're

00:00:46.369 --> 00:00:46.379 
jailbreak switch for that so you're

00:00:46.379 --> 00:00:47.270 
jailbreak switch for that so you're
going<00:00:46.469> to<00:00:46.559> go<00:00:46.649> over<00:00:46.680> here<00:00:46.920> you're<00:00:47.129> going<00:00:47.219> to

00:00:47.270 --> 00:00:47.280 
going to go over here you're going to

00:00:47.280 --> 00:00:52.189 
going to go over here you're going to
type<00:00:47.489> in<00:00:47.640> safari<00:00:48.500> oops<00:00:49.500> and<00:00:49.950> then<00:00:50.840> just<00:00:51.840> down

00:00:52.189 --> 00:00:52.199 
type in safari oops and then just down

00:00:52.199 --> 00:00:54.709 
type in safari oops and then just down
and<00:00:52.670> that<00:00:53.670> should<00:00:53.910> find<00:00:54.059> it<00:00:54.120> and<00:00:54.180> so<00:00:54.390> if<00:00:54.600> you

00:00:54.709 --> 00:00:54.719 
and that should find it and so if you

00:00:54.719 --> 00:00:56.810 
and that should find it and so if you
see<00:00:54.930> so<00:00:55.199> far<00:00:55.350> a<00:00:55.410> download<00:00:55.770> manager<00:00:55.800> used<00:00:56.550> to<00:00:56.699> be

00:01:02.730 --> 00:01:04.429 
it's not supported so one that's almost
exactly<00:01:02.940> like<00:01:03.329> that<00:01:03.510> is<00:01:03.809> if<00:01:03.930> you<00:01:04.019> scroll<00:01:04.260> down

see I don't have that much stuff right
now<00:03:22.350> let's<00:03:22.650> just<00:03:22.770> because<00:03:22.980> I<00:03:23.040> haven't<00:03:23.190> bought

00:03:23.390 --> 00:03:23.400 
now let's just because I haven't bought

00:03:23.400 --> 00:03:25.520 
now let's just because I haven't bought
anything<00:03:23.670> but<00:03:24.330> basically<00:03:24.810> what<00:03:25.110> this<00:03:25.290> heck

00:03:25.520 --> 00:03:25.530 
anything but basically what this heck

00:03:25.530 --> 00:03:28.070 
anything but basically what this heck
does<00:03:25.800> is<00:03:26.070> you<00:03:26.730> have<00:03:26.940> a<00:03:26.970> bunch<00:03:27.210> of<00:03:27.300> quests<00:03:27.900> and

00:03:28.070 --> 00:03:28.080 
does is you have a bunch of quests and

00:03:28.080 --> 00:03:30.290 
does is you have a bunch of quests and
land<00:03:28.530> to<00:03:28.770> explore<00:03:29.220> and<00:03:29.400> so<00:03:29.910> it's<00:03:30.060> almost<00:03:30.150> like

00:03:30.290 --> 00:03:30.300 
land to explore and so it's almost like

00:03:30.300 --> 00:03:31.700 
land to explore and so it's almost like
a<00:03:30.390> little<00:03:30.630> like<00:03:30.750> mini<00:03:30.990> clash<00:03:31.230> of<00:03:31.350> clans<00:03:31.590> you

00:03:31.700 --> 00:03:31.710 
a little like mini clash of clans you

00:03:31.710 --> 00:03:33.380 
a little like mini clash of clans you
could<00:03:31.830> say<00:03:32.010> or<00:03:32.460> something<00:03:32.700> like<00:03:32.760> that<00:03:32.820> so<00:03:32.940> say

00:03:33.380 --> 00:03:33.390 
could say or something like that so say

00:03:33.390 --> 00:03:38.060 
could say or something like that so say
if<00:03:33.600> I<00:03:33.780> were<00:03:33.990> to<00:03:34.140> go<00:03:34.320> explore<00:03:35.190> someplace<00:03:37.070> what

00:03:38.060 --> 00:03:38.070 
if I were to go explore someplace what

00:03:38.070 --> 00:03:40.030 
if I were to go explore someplace what
it<00:03:38.160> does<00:03:38.370> is<00:03:38.670> no<00:03:38.850> matter<00:03:39.030> what<00:03:39.390> you<00:03:39.510> have

00:03:40.030 --> 00:03:40.040 
it does is no matter what you have

00:03:40.040 --> 00:03:42.620 
it does is no matter what you have
whenever<00:03:41.040> you<00:03:41.280> attack<00:03:41.430> someone<00:03:42.210> like<00:03:42.420> this

00:03:42.620 --> 00:03:42.630 
whenever you attack someone like this

00:03:42.630 --> 00:03:45.440 
whenever you attack someone like this
guy<00:03:42.840> for<00:03:43.800> one<00:03:44.040> it<00:03:44.280> costs<00:03:44.700> nothing<00:03:44.880> to<00:03:45.090> attack

00:03:45.440 --> 00:03:45.450 
guy for one it costs nothing to attack

00:03:45.450 --> 00:03:46.790 
guy for one it costs nothing to attack
no<00:03:45.720> energy<00:03:46.140> you<00:03:46.260> don't<00:03:46.410> have<00:03:46.500> to<00:03:46.590> use<00:03:46.710> your

energy<00:03:46.980> or<00:03:47.400> your<00:03:47.550> swords<00:03:47.940> you'll<00:03:48.540> tell<00:03:48.720> you

00:03:48.800 --> 00:03:48.810 
energy or your swords you'll tell you

00:03:48.810 --> 00:03:50.450 
energy or your swords you'll tell you
level<00:03:49.110> of<00:03:49.200> course<00:03:49.410> like<00:03:49.560> that<00:03:49.740> so<00:03:50.220> when<00:03:50.340> you

00:03:50.450 --> 00:03:50.460 
level of course like that so when you

00:03:50.460 --> 00:03:52.550 
level of course like that so when you
click<00:03:50.550> fight<00:03:50.940> them<00:03:51.090> when<00:03:51.810> you<00:03:51.930> go<00:03:52.110> to<00:03:52.170> fight

00:03:52.550 --> 00:03:52.560 
click fight them when you go to fight

00:03:52.560 --> 00:03:55.880 
click fight them when you go to fight
them<00:03:52.800> they<00:03:53.520> are<00:03:53.850> one<00:03:54.570> hit<00:03:54.780> kill<00:03:55.020> and<00:03:55.290> they

00:03:55.880 --> 00:03:55.890 
them they are one hit kill and they

00:03:55.890 --> 00:03:57.710 
them they are one hit kill and they
can't<00:03:56.250> kill<00:03:56.520> me<00:03:56.670> so<00:03:56.880> I<00:03:56.910> can<00:03:57.150> just<00:03:57.300> sit<00:03:57.540> here

00:03:57.710 --> 00:03:57.720 
can't kill me so I can just sit here

00:03:57.720 --> 00:03:59.570 
can't kill me so I can just sit here
they're<00:03:57.930> taking<00:03:58.290> zero<00:03:58.560> out<00:03:58.860> and<00:03:59.070> they'll

00:03:59.570 --> 00:03:59.580 
they're taking zero out and they'll

00:03:59.580 --> 00:04:01.910 
they're taking zero out and they'll
continuously<00:04:00.360> take<00:04:00.720> zero<00:04:01.110> away<00:04:01.440> from<00:04:01.680> me<00:04:01.770> and

00:04:01.910 --> 00:04:01.920 
continuously take zero away from me and

00:04:01.920 --> 00:04:04.700 
continuously take zero away from me and
I<00:04:02.550> can<00:04:03.180> just<00:04:03.330> one<00:04:03.630> hit<00:04:03.810> them<00:04:03.990> so<00:04:04.350> that<00:04:04.380> guy's

00:04:04.700 --> 00:04:04.710 
I can just one hit them so that guy's

00:04:04.710 --> 00:04:08.030 
I can just one hit them so that guy's
dead<00:04:05.120> that<00:04:06.120> guy's<00:04:06.360> dead<00:04:06.690> and<00:04:07.050> so<00:04:07.800> you<00:04:07.860> could

00:04:08.030 --> 00:04:08.040 
dead that guy's dead and so you could

00:04:08.040 --> 00:04:09.260 
dead that guy's dead and so you could
basically<00:04:08.190> just<00:04:08.550> when<00:04:08.700> really<00:04:08.970> easily

00:04:09.260 --> 00:04:09.270 
basically just when really easily

00:04:09.270 --> 00:04:12.230 
basically just when really easily
collect<00:04:10.170> the<00:04:10.380> stuff<00:04:10.440> that<00:04:10.800> you<00:04:10.890> want<00:04:11.150> exit<00:04:12.150> out

00:04:13.820 --> 00:04:13.830 
of that and everything else like that is

00:04:13.830 --> 00:04:16.280 
of that and everything else like that is
regular<00:04:14.360> except<00:04:15.360> that<00:04:15.510> you<00:04:15.600> don't<00:04:15.810> lose<00:04:16.049> any

00:04:16.280 --> 00:04:16.290 
regular except that you don't lose any

00:04:16.290 --> 00:04:17.810 
regular except that you don't lose any
energy<00:04:16.680> which<00:04:16.859> could<00:04:17.070> slow<00:04:17.280> you<00:04:17.340> down<00:04:17.520> because

00:04:17.810 --> 00:04:17.820 
energy which could slow you down because

00:04:17.820 --> 00:04:19.400 
energy which could slow you down because
you<00:04:17.880> only<00:04:17.970> get<00:04:18.120> ten<00:04:18.420> so<00:04:18.630> you'd<00:04:18.750> only<00:04:18.989> be<00:04:19.200> able

00:04:19.400 --> 00:04:19.410 
you only get ten so you'd only be able

00:04:19.410 --> 00:04:21.289 
you only get ten so you'd only be able
to<00:04:19.470> do<00:04:19.590> certain<00:04:19.859> amount<00:04:20.130> of<00:04:20.160> missions<00:04:20.520> but

00:04:23.700 --> 00:04:25.740 
here as you can see I can be everyone
even<00:04:23.970> the<00:04:24.150> bosses<00:04:24.690> with

00:04:25.740 --> 00:04:25.750 
even the bosses with

00:04:25.750 --> 00:04:28.740 
even the bosses with
one<00:04:25.840> hit<00:04:26.080> and<00:04:26.320> I<00:04:26.440> never<00:04:26.770> die<00:04:27.550> so<00:04:28.360> this<00:04:28.570> can
