00:00:13.240 --> 00:00:20.860
 youtube official and we have it is 

00:00:17.019 --> 00:00:22.650
 capture that actually combined with the 

00:00:20.860 --> 00:00:25.860
 with the new update of youtube 

00:00:22.650 --> 00:00:27.900
 this we already have 

00:00:25.860 --> 00:00:29.640
 this application is totally free 

00:00:27.900 --> 00:00:32.150
 but you have to download it separately from 

00:00:29.640 --> 00:00:35.550
 youtube once the application is downloaded 

00:00:32.150 --> 00:00:37.470
 Well, here you will appear caption 

00:00:35.550 --> 00:00:40.560
 You can search it as I say in the app 

00:00:37.470 --> 00:00:43.100
 store this potter totally free and 

00:00:40.560 --> 00:00:43.100
 Well let's see 

00:00:44.100 --> 00:00:49.400
 gives us the option of 

00:00:47.070 --> 00:00:53.330
 Record 

00:00:49.400 --> 00:00:57.770
 for example I do not know here is I am with 

00:00:53.330 --> 00:00:59.720
 facebook me so a speaker this gives us 

00:00:57.770 --> 00:01:01.670
 the option to record it and upload it to 

00:00:59.720 --> 00:01:05.390
 Youtube or upload a video has already 

00:01:01.670 --> 00:01:07.250
 engraved here we give 

00:01:05.390 --> 00:01:12.850
 and I have only two videos that 

00:01:07.250 --> 00:01:12.850
 no use let's imagine that I choose this 

00:01:13.710 --> 00:01:18.420
 set privacy share and 

00:01:15.900 --> 00:01:20.760
 improve already gives us the option to edit the 

00:01:18.420 --> 00:01:23.450
 video right here and become 

00:01:20.760 --> 00:01:27.020
 a computer and correct the color 

00:01:23.450 --> 00:01:30.080
 stabilize it trim or put music 

00:01:27.020 --> 00:01:33.840
 we have obviously to put the title 

00:01:30.080 --> 00:01:35.520
 to put it in privacy and share it 

00:01:33.840 --> 00:01:38.550
 in our google + facebook accounts 

00:01:35.520 --> 00:01:41.130
 and twitter is obviously going to ask you 

00:01:38.550 --> 00:01:44.340
 link with your YouTube account the one 

00:01:41.130 --> 00:01:48.000
 ulma google + too and those are the 

00:01:44.340 --> 00:01:50.250
 only two this is the only two 

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:52.490
 necessary the facebook and twitter and 

00:01:50.250 --> 00:01:57.409
 they would be optional if you want to put them 

00:01:52.490 --> 00:02:00.520
 and then let's see correct color 

00:01:57.409 --> 00:02:03.149
 but the simpsons chapter 

00:02:00.520 --> 00:02:03.149
 stabilize 

00:02:04.150 --> 00:02:10.450
 or what soundtrack to cut 

00:02:07.280 --> 00:02:10.450
 here we can see 

00:02:14.300 --> 00:02:17.510
 this 

00:02:17.660 --> 00:02:20.980
 where can we start 

00:02:22.210 --> 00:02:28.470
 and we also have to stabilize more 

00:02:25.660 --> 00:02:28.470
 I chose them 

00:02:30.260 --> 00:02:33.159
 correct color 

00:02:38.750 --> 00:02:44.319
 and the soundtrack 

00:02:40.790 --> 00:02:44.319
 classic wedding and disco 

00:02:47.400 --> 00:02:52.349
 a beloved the truth but it serves for what 

00:02:50.640 --> 00:02:56.159
 that would be an improvised video 

00:02:52.349 --> 00:02:58.049
 suddenly or I do not know classic idiot that 

00:02:56.159 --> 00:03:00.360

00:02:58.049 --> 00:03:02.459
 go up for this serves and the truth is very 

00:03:00.360 --> 00:03:04.620
