they make such such a great you know
always<00:03:20.680> open<00:03:20.980> insane<00:03:21.310> when<00:03:21.520> you<00:03:21.610> just<00:03:21.850> a

00:03:21.990 --> 00:03:22.000 
always open insane when you just a

00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:24.540 
always open insane when you just a
formality<00:03:22.300> but<00:03:22.900> here<00:03:23.350> it<00:03:23.500> is<00:03:23.709> I<00:03:23.950> like<00:03:24.340> very

00:03:24.540 --> 00:03:24.550

00:04:21.070 --> 00:04:24.180 
and I think that the other players will
also<00:04:21.720> do<00:04:22.720> the<00:04:22.750> same<00:04:22.840> and<00:04:23.200> will<00:04:23.590> produce<00:04:23.830> a<00:04:24.040> very
