camcorder<00:00:26.760> I<00:00:27.060> think<00:00:27.359> for<00:00:27.510> the<00:00:27.599> slow<00:00:27.779> motion

00:00:27.980 --> 00:00:27.990 
camcorder I think for the slow motion

00:00:27.990 --> 00:00:30.259 
camcorder I think for the slow motion
feature<00:00:28.410> because<00:00:29.250> it's<00:00:29.400> the<00:00:29.460> only<00:00:29.580> camcorder

00:00:30.259 --> 00:00:30.269 
feature because it's the only camcorder

00:00:30.269 --> 00:00:32.450 
feature because it's the only camcorder
in<00:00:30.420> the<00:00:30.510> price<00:00:30.750> range<00:00:31.050> that<00:00:31.230> gives<00:00:31.679> you<00:00:31.769> 1920

00:00:32.450 --> 00:00:32.460 
in the price range that gives you 1920

00:00:32.460 --> 00:00:34.910 
in the price range that gives you 1920
1080<00:00:32.669> P<00:00:33.149> under<00:00:33.750> 20<00:00:34.020> frames<00:00:34.260> per<00:00:34.350> second<00:00:34.829> it's

00:00:34.910 --> 00:00:34.920 
1080 P under 20 frames per second it's

00:00:34.920 --> 00:00:38.180 
1080 P under 20 frames per second it's
the<00:00:34.980> reason<00:00:35.250> I<00:00:35.340> bought<00:00:35.550> it<00:00:36.620> get<00:00:37.620> slow<00:00:37.860> motion

00:00:38.180 --> 00:00:38.190 
the reason I bought it get slow motion

00:00:38.190 --> 00:00:40.670 
the reason I bought it get slow motion
mode<00:00:38.340> you<00:00:38.850> got<00:00:39.000> a<00:00:39.030> hit<00:00:39.210> auto<00:00:39.510> switch<00:00:40.350> over<00:00:40.649> to

00:00:40.670 --> 00:00:40.680 
mode you got a hit auto switch over to

00:00:40.680 --> 00:00:44.930 
mode you got a hit auto switch over to
slow<00:00:41.190> motion<00:00:43.280> the<00:00:44.280> first<00:00:44.430> thing<00:00:44.670> I<00:00:44.730> want<00:00:44.879> to

00:00:44.930 --> 00:00:44.940 
slow motion the first thing I want to

00:00:44.940 --> 00:00:46.940 
slow motion the first thing I want to
point<00:00:45.059> out<00:00:45.239> is<00:00:45.450> when<00:00:45.660> you<00:00:46.289> look<00:00:46.440> at<00:00:46.559> the<00:00:46.680> screen

00:00:46.940 --> 00:00:46.950 
point out is when you look at the screen

00:00:48.889 --> 00:00:48.899 
you can see that half the box is now cut

00:00:48.899 --> 00:00:51.080 
you can see that half the box is now cut
off<00:00:48.930> top<00:00:49.920> the<00:00:50.070> screens<00:00:50.399> cut<00:00:50.670> off<00:00:50.820> and<00:00:51.030> the

00:00:51.080 --> 00:00:51.090 
off top the screens cut off and the

off top the screens cut off and the
closets<00:00:51.629> gone<00:00:51.780> on<00:00:52.020> the<00:00:52.140> right<00:00:52.320> it<00:00:53.070> narrows<00:00:53.550> the

00:00:53.840 --> 00:00:53.850 
closets gone on the right it narrows the

00:00:53.850 --> 00:00:56.299 
closets gone on the right it narrows the
frame<00:00:54.210> when<00:00:54.719> you<00:00:54.809> switch<00:00:55.050> to<00:00:55.079> slow<00:00:55.410> motion<00:00:55.800> why

00:00:56.299 --> 00:00:56.309 
frame when you switch to slow motion why

00:00:56.309 --> 00:00:58.639 
frame when you switch to slow motion why
I<00:00:56.610> have<00:00:56.850> no<00:00:57.059> idea<00:00:57.390> it's<00:00:58.140> something<00:00:58.500> you<00:00:58.559> need

don't<00:01:40.200> have<00:01:40.380> three<00:01:40.619> hands<00:01:41.009> you're<00:01:41.189> gonna<00:01:41.250> need

00:01:41.539 --> 00:01:41.549 
don't have three hands you're gonna need

00:01:41.549 --> 00:01:43.130 
don't have three hands you're gonna need
to<00:01:41.700> set<00:01:41.880> that<00:01:42.060> to<00:01:42.210> always<00:01:42.509> I<00:01:42.689> don't<00:01:42.840> know<00:01:42.930> why

00:01:43.130 --> 00:01:43.140 
to set that to always I don't know why

00:01:43.140 --> 00:01:45.530 
to set that to always I don't know why
it<00:01:43.200> isn't<00:01:43.590> by<00:01:43.710> default<00:01:44.100> the<00:01:45.000> second<00:01:45.329> thing<00:01:45.450> to

00:01:45.530 --> 00:01:45.540 
it isn't by default the second thing to

00:01:45.540 --> 00:01:48.139 
it isn't by default the second thing to
point<00:01:45.720> out<00:01:45.960> is<00:01:46.220> slow<00:01:47.220> motion<00:01:47.490> videos<00:01:47.759> record

00:01:48.139 --> 00:01:48.149 
point out is slow motion videos record

00:01:48.149 --> 00:01:50.539 
point out is slow motion videos record
with<00:01:48.329> no<00:01:48.570> sound<00:01:48.960> so<00:01:49.829> if<00:01:50.070> you're<00:01:50.250> looking<00:01:50.369> for

00:01:50.539 --> 00:01:50.549 
with no sound so if you're looking for

00:01:50.549 --> 00:01:52.069 
with no sound so if you're looking for
sound<00:01:50.909> there's<00:01:51.360> a<00:01:51.420> reason<00:01:51.720> you<00:01:51.780> got<00:01:51.930> that

00:01:52.069 --> 00:01:52.079 
sound there's a reason you got that

00:01:52.079 --> 00:01:53.569 
sound there's a reason you got that
microphone<00:01:52.590> with<00:01:52.799> the<00:01:52.890> cross<00:01:53.100> on<00:01:53.310> out<00:01:53.460> in<00:01:53.549> the

00:01:53.569 --> 00:01:53.579 
microphone with the cross on out in the

00:01:53.579 --> 00:01:56.510 
microphone with the cross on out in the
bottom<00:01:53.909> it<00:01:54.570> has<00:01:54.869> no<00:01:55.079> sound<00:01:55.290> okay<00:01:55.740> you<00:01:56.310> need<00:01:56.460> to

00:01:56.510 --> 00:01:56.520 
bottom it has no sound okay you need to

00:01:56.520 --> 00:02:01.069 
bottom it has no sound okay you need to
realize<00:01:56.909> that<00:01:59.540> once<00:02:00.540> you<00:02:00.630> go<00:02:00.719> into<00:02:00.840> playback

00:02:01.069 --> 00:02:01.079 
realize that once you go into playback

00:02:01.079 --> 00:02:05.240 
realize that once you go into playback
mode<00:02:01.530> on<00:02:01.829> slow<00:02:02.250> motion<00:02:03.740> first<00:02:04.740> off<00:02:05.009> I'm<00:02:05.159> gonna

00:02:05.240 --> 00:02:05.250 
mode on slow motion first off I'm gonna

00:02:05.250 --> 00:02:07.130 
mode on slow motion first off I'm gonna
point<00:02:05.460> out<00:02:05.610> I<00:02:05.670> recorded<00:02:06.119> an<00:02:06.240> ABC<00:02:06.570> HD<00:02:06.659> video

00:02:07.130 --> 00:02:07.140 
point out I recorded an ABC HD video

00:02:07.140 --> 00:02:08.600 
point out I recorded an ABC HD video
beforehand<00:02:07.770> so<00:02:07.920> there's<00:02:08.069> two<00:02:08.250> videos

00:02:08.600 --> 00:02:08.610 
beforehand so there's two videos

00:02:08.610 --> 00:02:10.940 
beforehand so there's two videos
recorded<00:02:08.759> on<00:02:09.119> this<00:02:09.239> camcorder<00:02:09.800> what<00:02:10.800> you're

seeing right now is one you're seeing
the<00:02:12.780> mp4

00:02:13.270 --> 00:02:13.280 
the mp4

00:02:13.280 --> 00:02:14.680 
the mp4
or<00:02:13.370> video<00:02:13.640> that<00:02:13.819> I<00:02:13.850> just<00:02:13.910> recorded<00:02:14.090> in<00:02:14.540> slow

00:02:14.680 --> 00:02:14.690 
or video that I just recorded in slow

00:02:14.690 --> 00:02:18.130 
or video that I just recorded in slow
motion<00:02:15.580> when<00:02:16.580> you<00:02:16.670> play<00:02:16.850> that<00:02:16.880> back<00:02:17.090> you<00:02:18.020> could

00:02:18.130 --> 00:02:18.140

00:02:18.140 --> 00:02:20.320 
motion when you play that back you could

you you have no choice in matter so if

00:02:41.720 --> 00:02:43.030 
you you have no choice in matter so if
you're<00:02:41.840> looking<00:02:41.930> at<00:02:42.200> freedom<00:02:42.590> and<00:02:42.739> editing

00:02:43.030 --> 00:02:43.040 
you're looking at freedom and editing

00:02:43.040 --> 00:02:45.160 
you're looking at freedom and editing
you<00:02:43.370> do<00:02:43.520> not<00:02:43.700> have<00:02:43.970> it<00:02:44.180> the<00:02:44.660> second<00:02:44.959> thing<00:02:45.080> to

00:02:45.160 --> 00:02:45.170 
you do not have it the second thing to

00:02:45.170 --> 00:02:46.540 
you do not have it the second thing to
point<00:02:45.260> out<00:02:45.410> is<00:02:45.470> I've<00:02:45.650> setup<00:02:45.980> recording<00:02:46.400> to

00:02:46.540 --> 00:02:46.550 
point out is I've setup recording to

00:02:46.550 --> 00:02:49.270 
point out is I've setup recording to
videos<00:02:46.910> you're<00:02:47.510> only<00:02:47.660> seeing<00:02:47.930> one<00:02:48.230> here<00:02:48.500> the

00:02:49.270 --> 00:02:49.280 
videos you're only seeing one here the

00:02:49.280 --> 00:02:50.920 
videos you're only seeing one here the
reason<00:02:49.610> is<00:02:49.730> you<00:02:49.970> can't<00:02:50.209> see<00:02:50.390> them<00:02:50.540> all<00:02:50.660> at<00:02:50.750> once

00:02:50.920 --> 00:02:50.930 
reason is you can't see them all at once

00:02:50.930 --> 00:02:53.740 
reason is you can't see them all at once
you<00:02:51.620> can<00:02:51.769> only<00:02:51.890> see<00:02:52.130> either<00:02:52.550> the<00:02:52.700> ABC<00:02:53.209> HD<00:02:53.330> or

00:02:53.740 --> 00:02:53.750 
you can only see either the ABC HD or

00:02:53.750 --> 00:02:57.220 
you can only see either the ABC HD or
the<00:02:54.140> mp4<00:02:54.620> so<00:02:54.860> if<00:02:54.920> I<00:02:54.980> switch<00:02:55.220> to<00:02:55.250> AVC<00:02:55.790> HD<00:02:55.989> it<00:02:56.989> will

00:02:57.220 --> 00:02:57.230 
the mp4 so if I switch to AVC HD it will

00:02:57.230 --> 00:02:59.979 
the mp4 so if I switch to AVC HD it will
now<00:02:57.380> show<00:02:57.680> me<00:02:57.890> that<00:02:58.310> video<00:02:58.730> in<00:02:59.000> that<00:02:59.750> video

00:02:59.979 --> 00:02:59.989 
now show me that video in that video

00:02:59.989 --> 00:03:02.860 
now show me that video in that video
only<00:03:00.620> it's<00:03:01.580> not<00:03:01.700> going<00:03:02.060> to<00:03:02.120> show<00:03:02.269> me<00:03:02.390> the<00:03:02.480> mp4

00:03:02.860 --> 00:03:02.870 
only it's not going to show me the mp4

00:03:02.870 --> 00:03:03.340 
only it's not going to show me the mp4
anymore

00:03:03.340 --> 00:03:03.350 
anymore

00:03:03.350 --> 00:03:04.750 
anymore
why<00:03:03.620> it<00:03:03.680> doesn't<00:03:04.069> show<00:03:04.220> them<00:03:04.370> all<00:03:04.459> on<00:03:04.580> one

00:03:04.750 --> 00:03:04.760 
why it doesn't show them all on one

00:03:04.760 --> 00:03:06.340 
why it doesn't show them all on one
screen<00:03:04.970> I<00:03:05.300> have<00:03:05.660> no<00:03:05.810> idea
