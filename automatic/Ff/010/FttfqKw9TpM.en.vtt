so<00:00:13.679> here<00:00:14.309> are<00:00:14.400> the<00:00:14.490> two<00:00:14.670> devices

00:00:18.070 --> 00:00:18.080 

00:00:18.080 --> 00:00:19.990 

first<00:00:18.740> thing<00:00:18.860> you<00:00:18.950> see<00:00:19.130> is<00:00:19.250> obvious<00:00:19.760> size

00:00:19.990 --> 00:00:20.000 
first thing you see is obvious size

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:22.570 
first thing you see is obvious size
difference<00:00:20.510> the<00:00:20.810> note<00:00:21.050> has<00:00:21.320> a<00:00:21.350> 5.3<00:00:21.980> inch<00:00:22.190> Super

difference the note has a 5.3 inch Super

00:00:22.580 --> 00:00:27.310 
difference the note has a 5.3 inch Super
AMOLED<00:00:23.230> screen<00:00:24.230> and<00:00:24.529> the<00:00:25.630> Galaxy<00:00:26.630> s3<00:00:26.750> has<00:00:27.290> a

four point eight inch and Tennessee just

00:00:28.880 --> 00:00:30.670 
four point eight inch and Tennessee just
from<00:00:29.240> a<00:00:29.330> size<00:00:29.509> perspective<00:00:29.779> how<00:00:30.259> different

00:00:30.670 --> 00:00:30.680 
from a size perspective how different

00:00:30.680 --> 00:00:33.940 
from a size perspective how different
the<00:00:30.770> two<00:00:30.800> are<00:00:31.809> God<00:00:32.809> says<00:00:33.050> three<00:00:33.350> fair<00:00:33.830> bit

00:00:33.940 --> 00:00:33.950 
the two are God says three fair bit

00:00:33.950 --> 00:00:35.590 
the two are God says three fair bit
smaller<00:00:34.220> physically<00:00:34.670> are<00:00:35.059> you're<00:00:35.180> not<00:00:35.300> giving

00:00:35.590 --> 00:00:35.600 
smaller physically are you're not giving

00:00:35.600 --> 00:00:38.049 
smaller physically are you're not giving
up<00:00:35.690> that<00:00:35.720> much<00:00:35.989> on<00:00:36.140> screen<00:00:36.440> real<00:00:36.559> estate<00:00:37.059> other

00:00:38.049 --> 00:00:38.059 
up that much on screen real estate other

00:00:38.059 --> 00:00:40.420 
up that much on screen real estate other
cool<00:00:38.330> thing<00:00:38.570> about<00:00:38.600> the<00:00:39.350> galaxy<00:00:40.100> s3<00:00:40.309> it's

00:00:40.420 --> 00:00:40.430 
cool thing about the galaxy s3 it's

00:00:40.430 --> 00:00:43.780 
cool thing about the galaxy s3 it's
actually<00:00:40.670> a<00:00:40.699> little<00:00:40.820> bit<00:00:40.910> thinner<00:00:41.210> than<00:00:42.790> the

00:00:43.780 --> 00:00:43.790 
actually a little bit thinner than the

00:00:43.790 --> 00:00:45.790 
actually a little bit thinner than the
galaxy<00:00:44.420> note<00:00:44.660> so<00:00:45.140> you'll<00:00:45.320> just<00:00:45.350> take<00:00:45.559> a<00:00:45.650> look

00:00:45.790 --> 00:00:45.800 
galaxy note so you'll just take a look

00:00:45.800 --> 00:00:48.100 
galaxy note so you'll just take a look
right<00:00:45.980> there<00:00:46.250> yeah<00:00:46.730> a<00:00:47.120> little<00:00:47.960> thinner

00:00:48.100 --> 00:00:48.110 
right there yeah a little thinner

00:00:48.110 --> 00:00:50.380 
right there yeah a little thinner
profile<00:00:48.590> and<00:00:48.890> then<00:00:49.489> the<00:00:49.760> big<00:00:49.910> difference<00:00:50.239> is

00:00:50.380 --> 00:00:50.390 
profile and then the big difference is

00:00:50.390 --> 00:00:51.880 
profile and then the big difference is
the<00:00:50.420> color<00:00:50.690> obviously<00:00:50.960> so<00:00:51.440> this<00:00:51.559> is<00:00:51.710> our

00:00:51.880 --> 00:00:51.890 
the color obviously so this is our

00:00:51.890 --> 00:00:55.329 
the color obviously so this is our
carbon<00:00:52.580> blue<00:00:53.229> galaxy<00:00:54.229> note<00:00:54.409> it's<00:00:55.010> a<00:00:55.129> little

00:00:55.329 --> 00:00:55.339 
carbon blue galaxy note it's a little

00:00:55.339 --> 00:00:56.890 
carbon blue galaxy note it's a little
worse<00:00:55.580> for<00:00:55.610> wear<00:00:55.940> on<00:00:56.000> the<00:00:56.210> back<00:00:56.360> here<00:00:56.629> it<00:00:56.780> is<00:00:56.870> a

00:00:56.890 --> 00:00:56.900 
worse for wear on the back here it is a

00:00:56.900 --> 00:00:59.860 
worse for wear on the back here it is a
working<00:00:57.350> device<00:00:57.879> and<00:00:58.879> the<00:00:59.330> pebble<00:00:59.690> blue

00:00:59.860 --> 00:00:59.870 
working device and the pebble blue

00:00:59.870 --> 00:01:03.369 
working device and the pebble blue
Galaxy<00:01:00.530> s3<00:01:00.680> so<00:01:01.280> freedom<00:01:02.180> cover<00:01:02.510> color<00:01:02.989> so<00:01:03.290> you

00:01:03.369 --> 00:01:03.379 
Galaxy s3 so freedom cover color so you

00:01:03.379 --> 00:01:04.719 
Galaxy s3 so freedom cover color so you
kind<00:01:03.559> of<00:01:03.619> see<00:01:03.710> it<00:01:03.799> looks<00:01:04.100> a<00:01:04.190> bit<00:01:04.220> like<00:01:04.369> brush

00:01:04.719 --> 00:01:04.729 
kind of see it looks a bit like brush

00:01:04.729 --> 00:01:06.969 
kind of see it looks a bit like brush
metal<00:01:04.940> but<00:01:05.180> it's<00:01:05.299> actually<00:01:05.659> super<00:01:05.990> smooth<00:01:06.290> on

00:01:06.969 --> 00:01:06.979 
metal but it's actually super smooth on

00:01:06.979 --> 00:01:08.560 
metal but it's actually super smooth on
the<00:01:07.130> back<00:01:07.310> its<00:01:07.520> uses<00:01:07.790> are<00:01:07.909> hyper<00:01:08.240> glaze

00:01:08.560 --> 00:01:08.570 
the back its uses are hyper glaze

00:01:08.570 --> 00:01:13.060 
the back its uses are hyper glaze
technology<00:01:09.470> for<00:01:09.619> finish<00:01:11.320> both<00:01:12.320> devices<00:01:12.710> have

00:01:13.060 --> 00:01:13.070 
technology for finish both devices have

00:01:13.070 --> 00:01:15.640 
technology for finish both devices have
eight<00:01:13.460> megapixel<00:01:14.060> shooters<00:01:14.420> but<00:01:15.229> the<00:01:15.409> really

00:01:15.640 --> 00:01:15.650 
eight megapixel shooters but the really

00:01:15.650 --> 00:01:16.929 
eight megapixel shooters but the really
cool<00:01:15.680> thing<00:01:15.890> when<00:01:16.430> you<00:01:16.520> move<00:01:16.640> up<00:01:16.760> to<00:01:16.850> the

00:01:16.929 --> 00:01:16.939 
cool thing when you move up to the

00:01:16.939 --> 00:01:19.210 
cool thing when you move up to the
galaxy<00:01:17.270> s3<00:01:17.600> is<00:01:17.720> it's<00:01:17.900> zero<00:01:18.170> zero<00:01:18.229> shutter<00:01:19.070> lag

00:01:19.210 --> 00:01:19.220 
galaxy s3 is it's zero zero shutter lag

00:01:19.220 --> 00:01:20.649 
galaxy s3 is it's zero zero shutter lag
and<00:01:19.640> a<00:01:19.700> bunch<00:01:19.909> of<00:01:19.970> advanced<00:01:20.240> camera

00:01:20.649 --> 00:01:20.659 
and a bunch of advanced camera

00:01:20.659 --> 00:01:21.940 
and a bunch of advanced camera
capabilities<00:01:21.170> so<00:01:21.530> while<00:01:21.680> they're<00:01:21.830> both

00:01:21.940 --> 00:01:21.950 
capabilities so while they're both

00:01:21.950 --> 00:01:24.370 
capabilities so while they're both
capture<00:01:22.370> 1080p<00:01:22.870> over<00:01:23.870> here<00:01:24.020> you<00:01:24.080> can<00:01:24.230> also

00:01:24.370 --> 00:01:24.380 
capture 1080p over here you can also

00:01:24.380 --> 00:01:27.430 
capture 1080p over here you can also
capture<00:01:24.940> full<00:01:25.940> frame<00:01:26.180> stills<00:01:26.540> while<00:01:27.080> shooting

00:01:27.430 --> 00:01:27.440 
capture full frame stills while shooting

00:01:27.440 --> 00:01:29.710 
capture full frame stills while shooting
the<00:01:27.530> video<00:01:27.770> you've<00:01:28.700> got<00:01:28.850> a<00:01:28.880> burst<00:01:29.150> mode<00:01:29.420> where

00:01:29.710 --> 00:01:29.720 
the video you've got a burst mode where

00:01:29.720 --> 00:01:33.280 
the video you've got a burst mode where
you<00:01:29.780> can<00:01:29.810> take<00:01:30.080> up<00:01:30.200> to<00:01:30.230> 20<00:01:30.560> shots<00:01:32.290> together

00:01:33.280 --> 00:01:33.290 
you can take up to 20 shots together

00:01:33.290 --> 00:01:35.260 
you can take up to 20 shots together
three<00:01:33.920> per<00:01:34.100> second<00:01:34.490> so<00:01:34.730> you<00:01:34.820> never<00:01:34.910> miss<00:01:35.120> the

00:01:35.260 --> 00:01:35.270 
three per second so you never miss the

00:01:35.270 --> 00:01:36.250 
three per second so you never miss the
action<00:01:35.570> when<00:01:35.720> you're<00:01:35.810> watching<00:01:35.930> a<00:01:36.110> football

00:01:55.210 --> 00:01:55.220 
version of the galaxy s3 so one of the

00:01:55.220 --> 00:01:56.710 
version of the galaxy s3 so one of the
differences<00:01:55.400> you'll<00:01:55.850> notice<00:01:56.120> here<00:01:56.390> is<00:01:56.540> down

00:01:56.710 --> 00:01:56.720 
differences you'll notice here is down

00:01:56.720 --> 00:01:57.910 
differences you'll notice here is down
at<00:01:56.810> the<00:01:56.870> bottom<00:01:56.930> where<00:01:57.380> you've<00:01:57.500> got<00:01:57.650> kind<00:01:57.800> of

00:01:57.910 --> 00:01:57.920 
at the bottom where you've got kind of

00:01:57.920 --> 00:01:59.460 
at the bottom where you've got kind of
the<00:01:57.980> traditional<00:01:58.460> four<00:01:58.670> capacitive<00:01:59.120> keys

00:01:59.460 --> 00:01:59.470 
the traditional four capacitive keys

00:01:59.470 --> 00:02:03.219 
the traditional four capacitive keys
over<00:02:00.470> here<00:02:00.860> on<00:02:01.070> the<00:02:01.570> galaxy<00:02:02.570> s3<00:02:02.690> what<00:02:03.110> we've

00:02:03.219 --> 00:02:03.229 
over here on the galaxy s3 what we've

00:02:03.229 --> 00:02:05.470 
over here on the galaxy s3 what we've
actually<00:02:03.440> got<00:02:03.830> is

00:02:05.470 --> 00:02:05.480 
actually got is

00:02:05.480 --> 00:02:07.390 
actually got is
a<00:02:05.540> physical<00:02:06.260> home<00:02:06.440> button<00:02:06.500> and<00:02:07.250> then

00:02:07.390 --> 00:02:07.400 
a physical home button and then

00:02:07.400 --> 00:02:10.510 
a physical home button and then
capacitive<00:02:08.030> menu<00:02:08.720> and<00:02:09.020> back<00:02:09.200> not<00:02:10.070> a<00:02:10.130> big<00:02:10.340> deal

00:02:10.510 --> 00:02:10.520 
capacitive menu and back not a big deal

00:02:10.520 --> 00:02:12.130 
capacitive menu and back not a big deal
because<00:02:10.730> when<00:02:11.030> you<00:02:11.150> actually<00:02:11.540> hold<00:02:11.840> the<00:02:11.930> Menu

00:02:12.130 --> 00:02:12.140 
because when you actually hold the Menu

00:02:12.140 --> 00:02:14.050 
because when you actually hold the Menu
button<00:02:12.170> it<00:02:12.740> takes<00:02:13.160> you<00:02:13.280> to<00:02:13.430> search<00:02:13.670> and<00:02:13.850> if<00:02:13.970> you

00:02:14.050 --> 00:02:14.060 
button it takes you to search and if you

00:02:14.060 --> 00:02:15.760 
button it takes you to search and if you
hold<00:02:14.270> the<00:02:14.360> home<00:02:14.540> key<00:02:14.570> it<00:02:15.110> actually<00:02:15.380> brings<00:02:15.530> up

00:02:15.760 --> 00:02:15.770 
hold the home key it actually brings up

00:02:15.770 --> 00:02:19.450 
hold the home key it actually brings up
recent<00:02:16.670> apps<00:02:17.080> so<00:02:18.080> let's<00:02:18.830> just<00:02:19.010> kind<00:02:19.430> of

00:02:19.450 --> 00:02:19.460 
recent apps so let's just kind of

00:02:19.460 --> 00:02:21.490 
recent apps so let's just kind of
quickly<00:02:19.730> dive<00:02:20.030> into<00:02:20.240> a<00:02:20.330> few<00:02:20.390> of<00:02:20.630> the<00:02:20.780> software

00:02:21.490 --> 00:02:21.500 
quickly dive into a few of the software

00:02:21.500 --> 00:02:24.880 
quickly dive into a few of the software
differences<00:02:21.950> on<00:02:22.070> the<00:02:22.160> devices<00:02:23.290> obviously<00:02:24.290> the

00:02:24.880 --> 00:02:24.890 
differences on the devices obviously the

00:02:24.890 --> 00:02:26.830 
differences on the devices obviously the
first<00:02:25.370> thing<00:02:25.490> you'll<00:02:25.610> notice<00:02:25.730> when<00:02:26.570> I<00:02:26.660> get

00:02:26.830 --> 00:02:26.840 
first thing you'll notice when I get

00:02:26.840 --> 00:02:30.940 
first thing you'll notice when I get
this<00:02:26.960> one<00:02:27.140> unlock<00:02:27.500> to<00:02:27.740> is<00:02:28.180> lock<00:02:29.180> screen<00:02:29.950> so

00:02:30.940 --> 00:02:30.950 
this one unlock to is lock screen so

00:02:30.950 --> 00:02:32.740 
this one unlock to is lock screen so
what<00:02:31.490> we've<00:02:31.640> done<00:02:31.760> has<00:02:31.880> done<00:02:32.300> a<00:02:32.330> lot<00:02:32.510> of<00:02:32.540> work

00:02:32.740 --> 00:02:32.750 
what we've done has done a lot of work

00:02:32.750 --> 00:02:35.560 
what we've done has done a lot of work
here<00:02:32.960> on<00:02:33.080> the<00:02:33.170> galaxy<00:02:33.530> s3<00:02:33.620> to<00:02:33.980> customize<00:02:34.570> the
