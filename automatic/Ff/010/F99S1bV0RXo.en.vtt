00:01:27.830 --> 00:01:27.840 
I can anything I uh unfortunately it's

00:01:27.840 --> 00:01:29.690 
I can anything I uh unfortunately it's
really<00:01:28.020> limited<00:01:28.530> in<00:01:28.619> its<00:01:28.740> animation<00:01:29.399> and<00:01:29.579> it's

00:01:29.690 --> 00:01:29.700 
really limited in its animation and it's

00:01:29.700 --> 00:01:31.429 
really limited in its animation and it's
voice<00:01:29.880> samples<00:01:30.420> you<00:01:30.719> can't<00:01:30.959> record<00:01:31.170> your<00:01:31.409> own

00:01:31.429 --> 00:01:31.439 
voice samples you can't record your own

00:01:31.439 --> 00:01:32.989 
voice samples you can't record your own
voice<00:01:31.709> but<00:01:31.979> there's<00:01:32.130> nothing<00:01:32.399> like<00:01:32.549> using<00:01:32.789> the

00:01:32.989 --> 00:01:32.999 
voice but there's nothing like using the

00:01:32.999 --> 00:01:34.879 
voice but there's nothing like using the
actual<00:01:33.420> voices<00:01:33.630> of<00:01:33.929> the<00:01:34.020> characters<00:01:34.200> but

00:01:34.879 --> 00:01:34.889 
actual voices of the characters but

00:01:34.889 --> 00:01:36.529 
actual voices of the characters but
there's<00:01:35.069> just<00:01:35.219> not<00:01:35.429> enough<00:01:35.490> voice<00:01:35.969> samples

00:01:36.529 --> 00:01:36.539 
there's just not enough voice samples

00:01:36.539 --> 00:01:38.419 
there's just not enough voice samples
making<00:01:36.929> it<00:01:37.049> very<00:01:37.319> difficult<00:01:37.950> to<00:01:38.100> create<00:01:38.310> a

00:01:38.419 --> 00:01:38.429 
making it very difficult to create a

00:01:38.429 --> 00:01:41.029 
making it very difficult to create a
coherent<00:01:38.759> story<00:01:39.179> but<00:01:39.840> this<00:01:40.319> thing<00:01:40.530> is<00:01:40.679> kind<00:01:40.979> of

00:01:41.029 --> 00:01:41.039 
coherent story but this thing is kind of

00:01:41.039 --> 00:01:43.309 
coherent story but this thing is kind of
neat<00:01:41.249> it's<00:01:41.520> really<00:01:41.789> easy<00:01:41.969> to<00:01:42.209> use<00:01:42.420> the<00:01:42.959> editing

00:01:43.309 --> 00:01:43.319 
neat it's really easy to use the editing

00:01:43.319 --> 00:01:45.590 
neat it's really easy to use the editing
is<00:01:43.469> very<00:01:43.740> simple<00:01:44.189> to<00:01:44.310> do<00:01:44.490> and<00:01:44.759> this<00:01:45.149> was<00:01:45.359> one<00:01:45.569> of

00:01:45.590 --> 00:01:45.600 
is very simple to do and this was one of

00:01:45.600 --> 00:01:47.719 
is very simple to do and this was one of
the<00:01:45.749> earlier<00:01:46.079> moviemaking<00:01:46.619> programs<00:01:47.189> with<00:01:47.399> 3d

the earlier moviemaking programs with 3d
models<00:01:48.090> but<00:01:48.479> just<00:01:49.020> like<00:01:49.200> the<00:01:49.350> x-men<00:01:49.740> cartoon

00:01:50.120 --> 00:01:50.130
