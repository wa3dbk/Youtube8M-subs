00:01:08.870 --> 00:01:08.880 
other ones that they brought in the ones

00:01:08.880 --> 00:01:13.000 
other ones that they brought in the ones
that<00:01:09.060> are<00:01:09.119> supposed<00:01:09.390> to<00:01:09.479> be<00:01:10.610> add-ons<00:01:11.610> to<00:01:11.970> the

00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:13.010 
that are supposed to be add-ons to the

00:01:13.010 --> 00:01:17.690 
that are supposed to be add-ons to the
revolutionary<00:01:14.010> matrix<00:01:15.799> why<00:01:16.799> because<00:01:17.280> they're

00:01:17.690 --> 00:01:17.700 
revolutionary matrix why because they're

00:01:17.700 --> 00:01:19.280 
revolutionary matrix why because they're
the<00:01:17.880> exact<00:01:18.180> same<00:01:18.210> toy<00:01:18.570> you<00:01:18.720> would<00:01:18.840> get<00:01:19.049> if<00:01:19.259> you

00:01:19.280 --> 00:01:19.290 
the exact same toy you would get if you

00:01:19.290 --> 00:01:22.399 
the exact same toy you would get if you
would<00:01:19.530> have<00:01:19.619> bought<00:01:19.799> the<00:01:20.780> disc<00:01:21.780> launcher

00:01:22.399 --> 00:01:22.409 
would have bought the disc launcher

00:01:22.409 --> 00:01:25.520 
would have bought the disc launcher
matrix<00:01:23.070> or<00:01:23.430> disc<00:01:23.900> Ultra<00:01:24.900> matrix<00:01:25.259> I<00:01:25.320> think<00:01:25.470> is

00:01:25.520 --> 00:01:25.530 
matrix or disc Ultra matrix I think is

00:01:25.530 --> 00:01:27.230 
matrix or disc Ultra matrix I think is
what<00:01:25.619> it<00:01:25.680> was<00:01:25.740> called<00:01:25.830> and<00:01:26.759> it<00:01:26.880> came<00:01:27.000> with<00:01:27.060> this

00:01:27.230 --> 00:01:27.240 
what it was called and it came with this

00:01:27.240 --> 00:01:28.940 
what it was called and it came with this
little<00:01:27.479> disc<00:01:27.689> that<00:01:27.869> you<00:01:27.930> can<00:01:28.080> put<00:01:28.259> into<00:01:28.619> it<00:01:28.770> and

00:01:28.940 --> 00:01:28.950 
little disc that you can put into it and

00:01:28.950 --> 00:01:31.160 
little disc that you can put into it and
it<00:01:29.100> will<00:01:29.189> flop<00:01:29.490> off<00:01:29.700> and<00:01:30.000> show<00:01:30.270> a<00:01:30.630> pop-up

00:01:31.160 --> 00:01:31.170 
it will flop off and show a pop-up

00:01:31.170 --> 00:01:33.109 
it will flop off and show a pop-up
figure<00:01:31.619> form<00:01:31.950> of<00:01:32.070> it<00:01:32.220> those<00:01:32.759> are<00:01:32.880> the<00:01:32.970> same

00:01:33.109 --> 00:01:33.119 
figure form of it those are the same

00:01:33.119 --> 00:01:34.940 
figure form of it those are the same
figures<00:01:33.420> you're<00:01:33.540> getting<00:01:33.930> so<00:01:34.530> you're<00:01:34.680> paying

00:01:34.940 --> 00:01:34.950 
figures you're getting so you're paying

00:01:34.950 --> 00:01:37.100 
figures you're getting so you're paying
almost<00:01:35.369> about<00:01:35.579> 8<00:01:35.820> bucks<00:01:36.150> for<00:01:36.630> just<00:01:36.659> the
