on<00:00:58.940> clearance<00:00:59.360> and<00:00:59.840> I<00:01:00.020> guess<00:01:00.260> it's<00:01:00.440> a<00:01:00.530> good

00:01:00.670 --> 00:01:00.680 
on clearance and I guess it's a good

00:01:00.680 --> 00:01:03.340 
on clearance and I guess it's a good
thing<00:01:00.740> that<00:01:01.370> micro<00:01:02.000> target<00:01:02.450> didn't<00:01:02.900> really

00:01:03.340 --> 00:01:03.350 
thing that micro target didn't really

00:01:03.350 --> 00:01:06.190 
thing that micro target didn't really
have<00:01:03.560> the<00:01:03.830> real<00:01:04.129> deeper<00:01:04.759> discounts<00:01:05.390> they

00:01:06.190 --> 00:01:06.200 
have the real deeper discounts they

00:01:06.200 --> 00:01:07.960 
have the real deeper discounts they
usually<00:01:06.680> start<00:01:06.890> at<00:01:06.979> thirty<00:01:07.189> percent<00:01:07.549> off<00:01:07.759> and

00:01:07.960 --> 00:01:07.970 
usually start at thirty percent off and

00:01:07.970 --> 00:01:09.670 
usually start at thirty percent off and
that's<00:01:08.119> where<00:01:08.299> they<00:01:08.420> were<00:01:08.479> at<00:01:08.750> so<00:01:09.140> I<00:01:09.170> got<00:01:09.500> some

00:01:09.670 --> 00:01:09.680 
that's where they were at so I got some

00:01:09.680 --> 00:01:13.630 
that's where they were at so I got some
things<00:01:09.890> anyway<00:01:10.930> I<00:01:11.930> did<00:01:12.350> not<00:01:12.470> buy<00:01:12.770> duplicates

00:01:13.630 --> 00:01:13.640 
things anyway I did not buy duplicates

00:01:13.640 --> 00:01:16.180 
things anyway I did not buy duplicates
which<00:01:13.909> is<00:01:14.090> unusual<00:01:14.300> for<00:01:14.870> me<00:01:15.140> and<00:01:15.409> all<00:01:15.650> fit<00:01:15.950> fits

00:01:16.180 --> 00:01:16.190 
which is unusual for me and all fit fits

00:01:16.190 --> 00:01:17.410 
which is unusual for me and all fit fits
because<00:01:16.340> they<00:01:16.640> weren't<00:01:16.790> at<00:01:16.909> fifty<00:01:17.180> percent

00:01:17.410 --> 00:01:17.420 
because they weren't at fifty percent

00:01:17.420 --> 00:01:18.880 
because they weren't at fifty percent
off<00:01:17.600> the<00:01:17.810> first<00:01:18.050> of<00:01:18.200> all<00:01:18.320> we'll<00:01:18.500> start<00:01:18.770> with

00:01:18.880 --> 00:01:18.890 
off the first of all we'll start with

00:01:18.890 --> 00:01:24.130 
off the first of all we'll start with
this<00:01:19.010> one<00:01:19.090> it's<00:01:20.090> a<00:01:20.330> duplo<00:01:20.930> sit<00:01:22.240> so<00:01:23.240> I'm<00:01:23.960> going

00:01:24.130 --> 00:01:24.140 
this one it's a duplo sit so I'm going

00:01:24.140 --> 00:01:27.490 
this one it's a duplo sit so I'm going
to<00:01:24.170> review<00:01:24.409> that<00:01:24.470> farm<00:01:25.159> animals<00:01:26.290> alright<00:01:27.290> get

00:01:27.490 --> 00:01:27.500 
to review that farm animals alright get

00:01:27.500 --> 00:01:30.520 
to review that farm animals alright get
that<00:01:27.800> I<00:01:28.010> got<00:01:28.820> another<00:01:29.240> one<00:01:29.570> of<00:01:29.750> the<00:01:29.930> castle

00:01:30.520 --> 00:01:30.530 
that I got another one of the castle

00:01:30.530 --> 00:01:36.070 
that I got another one of the castle
Cavalry's<00:01:31.600> its<00:01:32.620> twenty<00:01:33.620> dollars<00:01:34.280> I<00:01:34.930> still<00:01:35.930> not

00:01:36.070 --> 00:01:36.080 
Cavalry's its twenty dollars I still not

00:01:36.080 --> 00:01:38.680 
Cavalry's its twenty dollars I still not
a<00:01:36.110> great<00:01:36.260> price<00:01:37.150> would<00:01:38.150> have<00:01:38.270> been<00:01:38.390> better<00:01:38.540> at

00:01:38.680 --> 00:01:38.690 
a great price would have been better at

00:01:38.690 --> 00:01:40.210 
a great price would have been better at
fifty<00:01:38.960> percent<00:01:39.260> off<00:01:39.470> but<00:01:39.710> I<00:01:39.770> thought<00:01:39.979> why<00:01:40.040> not

00:01:40.210 --> 00:01:40.220 
fifty percent off but I thought why not

00:01:40.220 --> 00:01:42.730 
fifty percent off but I thought why not
I<00:01:40.700> just<00:01:41.330> go<00:01:41.510> ahead<00:01:41.630> and<00:01:41.780> get<00:01:42.049> it<00:01:42.200> because<00:01:42.380> I<00:01:42.530> I

00:01:42.730 --> 00:01:42.740 
I just go ahead and get it because I I

00:01:42.740 --> 00:01:43.750 
I just go ahead and get it because I I
was<00:01:42.979> thinking<00:01:43.250> about<00:01:43.280> maybe<00:01:43.549> getting

00:01:43.750 --> 00:01:43.760 
was thinking about maybe getting

00:01:43.760 --> 00:01:47.260 
was thinking about maybe getting
duplicates<00:01:44.570> of<00:01:44.960> the<00:01:45.560> lego<00:01:46.370> movie<00:01:46.400> sets<00:01:46.940> i<00:01:47.090> only

00:01:52.149 --> 00:01:52.159 
maybe for the sig figs or something I

00:01:52.159 --> 00:01:55.240 
maybe for the sig figs or something I
might<00:01:52.310> get<00:01:52.460> more<00:01:52.670> I<00:01:52.909> got<00:01:53.840> this<00:01:54.229> one<00:01:54.290> which<00:01:55.220> is
