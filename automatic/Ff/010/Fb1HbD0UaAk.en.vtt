can only get away with it for so long
when<00:03:28.040> you<00:03:28.160> drive<00:03:28.790> with<00:03:29.000> that<00:03:29.180> attitude<00:03:29.360> well

00:03:30.190 --> 00:03:30.200 
when you drive with that attitude well

00:03:30.200 --> 00:03:33.060 
when you drive with that attitude well
at<00:03:30.410> the<00:03:30.530> beginning<00:03:30.650> I<00:03:31.010> think<00:03:31.070> he<00:03:31.430> was<00:03:31.780> he<00:03:32.780> was

00:03:33.060 --> 00:03:33.070 
at the beginning I think he was he was

00:03:33.070 --> 00:03:35.410 
at the beginning I think he was he was
crossing<00:03:34.070> quite<00:03:34.280> a<00:03:34.310> lot<00:03:34.580> it<00:03:34.760> was<00:03:34.850> obviously

00:03:35.410 --> 00:03:35.420 
crossing quite a lot it was obviously

00:03:35.420 --> 00:03:37.210 
crossing quite a lot it was obviously
pushing<00:03:35.630> very<00:03:35.750> hard<00:03:36.020> somebody<00:03:36.800> who<00:03:36.860> drives<00:03:37.070> a

00:03:37.210 --> 00:03:37.220 
pushing very hard somebody who drives a

00:03:37.220 --> 00:03:38.980 
pushing very hard somebody who drives a
hundred<00:03:37.580> and<00:03:37.880> ten<00:03:38.060> percent<00:03:38.120> you<00:03:38.660> can<00:03:38.810> always

00:03:38.980 --> 00:03:38.990 
hundred and ten percent you can always

00:03:38.990 --> 00:03:41.200 
hundred and ten percent you can always
bring<00:03:39.200> them<00:03:39.410> back<00:03:39.560> ten<00:03:39.890> percent<00:03:40.310> but<00:03:40.880> somebody

00:03:41.200 --> 00:03:41.210 
bring them back ten percent but somebody

00:03:41.210 --> 00:03:43.300 
bring them back ten percent but somebody
who's<00:03:41.390> can<00:03:41.930> get<00:03:42.110> to<00:03:42.290> 90<00:03:42.770> it's<00:03:42.920> a<00:03:43.040> very

00:03:43.300 --> 00:03:43.310 
who's can get to 90 it's a very

00:03:43.310 --> 00:03:45.280 
who's can get to 90 it's a very
difficult<00:03:43.880> getting<00:03:44.270> from<00:03:44.780> ninety<00:03:45.110> to<00:03:45.260> a

00:03:45.280 --> 00:03:45.290 
difficult getting from ninety to a

00:03:45.290 --> 00:03:47.230 
difficult getting from ninety to a
hundred<00:03:45.320> percent<00:03:45.680> and<00:03:46.250> I<00:03:46.580> think<00:03:46.610> David<00:03:47.090> knew

00:03:47.230 --> 00:03:47.240 
hundred percent and I think David knew

00:03:47.240 --> 00:03:49.840 
hundred percent and I think David knew
that<00:03:47.450> as<00:03:47.630> well<00:03:47.840> oh<00:03:48.080> it<00:03:48.470> was<00:03:48.740> a<00:03:48.770> very<00:03:49.310> expensive

00:03:49.840 --> 00:03:49.850 
that as well oh it was a very expensive
