the only reason why I delayed it is
because<00:03:04.840> I<00:03:05.079> had<00:03:05.200> to<00:03:05.290> put<00:03:05.500> the<00:03:05.920> Let's<00:03:06.159> Plays<00:03:06.400> on

00:03:06.630 --> 00:03:06.640 
because I had to put the Let's Plays on

00:03:06.640 --> 00:03:07.740 
because I had to put the Let's Plays on
a<00:03:06.670> back<00:03:06.879> burner<00:03:07.090> because<00:03:07.269> I<00:03:07.480> always<00:03:07.599> try

00:03:07.740 --> 00:03:07.750 
a back burner because I always try

00:03:07.750 --> 00:03:09.869 
a back burner because I always try
against<00:03:07.989> mini<00:03:08.200> clips<00:03:08.500> as<00:03:08.620> possible<00:03:09.129> but<00:03:09.640> I

00:03:09.869 --> 00:03:09.879 
against mini clips as possible but I

00:03:09.879 --> 00:03:12.539 
against mini clips as possible but I
will<00:03:10.329> begin<00:03:10.450> back<00:03:10.750> into<00:03:10.959> that<00:03:11.109> so<00:03:12.040> the<00:03:12.310> point

00:03:12.539 --> 00:03:12.549 
will begin back into that so the point

00:03:12.549 --> 00:03:15.569 
will begin back into that so the point
that<00:03:12.609> just<00:03:12.970> be<00:03:13.120> diverse<00:03:13.540> and<00:03:13.989> just<00:03:14.890> touched<00:03:15.340> as
