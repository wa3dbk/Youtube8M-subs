00:00:04.140 --> 00:00:05.380
 you want 

00:00:05.380 --> 00:00:09.270
 print this drawing in a4 format 

00:00:10.939 --> 00:00:15.449
 first we analyze the actual size of the drawing there are 

00:00:15.449 --> 00:00:16.789
 already the quotas 

00:00:16.789 --> 00:00:21.410
 and we can verify them even with distance we are going to verify a quota 

00:00:21.410 --> 00:00:23.759
 if it actually matches 

00:00:23.759 --> 00:00:26.860
 and actually tells me this alone 

00:00:26.860 --> 00:00:32.170
 this piece is designed for dinner 110 mm and then 

00:00:32.680 --> 00:00:35.680
 a size of approximately 110 

00:00:36.680 --> 00:00:39.340
 I love you a calculation 

00:00:39.340 --> 00:00:43.010
 the horizontal encumbrance 190 then 

00:00:43.010 --> 00:00:46.010
 it is on a scale a4 sheet 

00:00:46.860 --> 00:00:49.860
 1 a1 

00:00:50.500 --> 00:00:52.440
 we are in the model space 

00:00:52.440 --> 00:00:55.360
 let's go to paper space 

00:00:55.360 --> 00:00:59.530
 here it was called exercise 1 normally if it has not been changed 

00:01:00.560 --> 00:01:03.490
 it's called lay-out 1 2 and so on 

00:01:03.490 --> 00:01:06.810
 the exercise now and that's what we would like to achieve 

00:01:08.120 --> 00:01:11.700
 we delete this window because we want to redo it 

00:01:12.660 --> 00:01:16.440
 then first thing we are his paper space you can see here below 

00:01:17.060 --> 00:01:20.060
 then display insert a window 

00:01:20.950 --> 00:01:25.190
 we don't have the squaring because we add it the second time 

00:01:25.190 --> 00:01:28.350
 from another in high exercise another part 

00:01:28.350 --> 00:01:30.830
 then we insert one 

00:01:30.830 --> 00:01:33.250
 window 

00:01:33.250 --> 00:01:36.130
 and as you can see we already have 

00:01:36.130 --> 00:01:39.040
 displayed 

00:01:39.040 --> 00:01:42.440
 the drawing in paper space 

00:01:42.440 --> 00:01:44.060
 relative 

00:01:44.060 --> 00:01:48.740
 or he also asks me xp, that is, the paper space xp stands for 

00:01:48.740 --> 00:01:49.990
 for yourself 

00:01:49.990 --> 00:01:52.020
 I give you a value of 1 

00:01:52.020 --> 00:01:52.729
 . 

00:01:52.729 --> 00:01:55.820
 ie 1 xp 

00:01:55.820 --> 00:01:58.780
 here 1 xp means that 

00:01:58.780 --> 00:02:01.310
 my drawing drawn in ita 

00:02:01.310 --> 00:02:03.420
 drawing point millimeter 

00:02:03.420 --> 00:02:06.189
 coincides with millimeters on paper 

00:02:06.189 --> 00:02:08.639
 we know that paper space 

00:02:08.639 --> 00:02:11.539
 then the table setting 

00:02:11.539 --> 00:02:13.509
 design community 

00:02:13.509 --> 00:02:18.789
 use the millimeter then a millimeter in the model and a millimeter paper space 

00:02:18.789 --> 00:02:20.130
 therefore coincide 

00:02:20.130 --> 00:02:22.959
 the scale factor is a 1 xp 

00:02:22.959 --> 00:02:25.959
 these facts to you the scale factor 

00:02:27.589 --> 00:02:30.909
 i 1 1 scale compared to an a4 format 

00:02:30.909 --> 00:02:33.969
 let's see another way to 

00:02:33.969 --> 00:02:36.989
 set or define the scale 

00:02:36.989 --> 00:02:40.540
 click on the scale we go to open the property window 

00:02:41.539 --> 00:02:43.589
 and in the properties window 

00:02:43.589 --> 00:02:48.319
 downwards we have the possibility to define the scale in fact conapo 

00:02:48.319 --> 00:02:53.869
 standard scale 1 custom scale 1 in fact we have just typed 1 1 

00:02:53.869 --> 00:02:59.199
 if we see we can also define or change the scale for example 1 2 

00:03:02.109 --> 00:03:04.629
 4 and so on 

00:03:04.629 --> 00:03:08.389
 therefore it is possible to define the scale also in the property window 

00:03:08.389 --> 00:03:10.209
 then 1 to 1 

00:03:10.209 --> 00:03:14.459
 and back to this scale of visualization and definition 

00:03:15.169 --> 00:03:18.299
 note that we are 

00:03:18.299 --> 00:03:23.299
 in the paper space the cadastre space designed this state entered this 

00:03:23.299 --> 00:03:24.199
 text 

00:03:24.199 --> 00:03:27.129
 where you are returned to the ladder 

00:03:27.129 --> 00:03:28.889
 eh a text that 

00:03:28.889 --> 00:03:34.039
 above the part of the model you are exposed the model with cream 

00:03:35.059 --> 00:03:36.109
 I see that 

00:03:36.109 --> 00:03:41.689
 the text remains in the paper space the model all flows in this window 

00:03:41.689 --> 00:03:44.779
 which is a transparent window 

00:03:44.779 --> 00:03:48.249
 the last part we can do about this is 

00:03:48.249 --> 00:03:51.549
 back to the paper space we have the window 

00:03:53.069 --> 00:03:56.889
 it is precisely in the paper space because it has been designed, we see also what it does 

00:03:56.889 --> 00:03:58.159
 part of this 

00:03:58.159 --> 00:04:00.009
 she was window 

00:04:00.009 --> 00:04:03.609
 at this point we want to freeze this window
