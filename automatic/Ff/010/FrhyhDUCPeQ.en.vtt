taller<00:02:30.630> high<00:02:31.230> school<00:02:31.530> tackles<00:02:32.040> is<00:02:32.550> the<00:02:32.730> fact

00:02:32.960 --> 00:02:32.970 
taller high school tackles is the fact

00:02:32.970 --> 00:02:34.580 
taller high school tackles is the fact

they can't get pad under pads and

00:02:34.590 --> 00:02:36.530 
they can't get pad under pads and
usually<00:02:35.430> the<00:02:35.520> reason<00:02:35.670> being<00:02:36.030> is<00:02:36.270> that<00:02:36.300> they're
