00:02:30.780 --> 00:02:33.590 
took about a minute for me but for you
if<00:02:30.930> your<00:02:31.080> computer<00:02:31.470> is<00:02:31.530> a<00:02:31.590> little<00:02:31.890> slow<00:02:32.600> might

00:02:33.590 --> 00:02:33.600 
if your computer is a little slow might

00:02:33.600 --> 00:02:39.910 
if your computer is a little slow might
take<00:02:33.870> about<00:02:34.620> five<00:02:35.100> to<00:02:35.750> two<00:02:36.750> to<00:02:36.870> five<00:02:37.050> minutes

00:02:39.910 --> 00:02:39.920 

00:02:39.920 --> 00:02:44.900 

and<00:02:41.630> it<00:02:42.630> should<00:02:43.050> it<00:02:43.260> will<00:02:43.500> say<00:02:43.890> not<00:02:44.160> responding

00:02:44.900 --> 00:02:44.910 
and it should it will say not responding

00:02:44.910 --> 00:02:46.910 
and it should it will say not responding
up<00:02:45.090> here<00:02:45.330> that<00:02:45.660> means<00:02:45.810> that<00:02:46.110> it's<00:02:46.260> downloading

00:02:46.910 --> 00:02:46.920 
up here that means that it's downloading

00:02:46.920 --> 00:02:50.000 
up here that means that it's downloading
the<00:02:47.130> jar<00:02:47.400> file<00:02:47.670> and<00:02:48.000> all<00:02:48.090> that<00:02:48.770> then<00:02:49.770> it<00:02:49.920> will

00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:50.010 
the jar file and all that then it will

00:02:50.010 --> 00:02:55.930 
the jar file and all that then it will
just<00:02:50.160> pop<00:02:50.370> up<00:02:50.610> it<00:02:50.820> will<00:02:50.910> be<00:02:51.200> 1.2.3<00:02:52.230> and<00:02:53.600> and

00:02:55.930 --> 00:02:55.940 
just pop up it will be 1.2.3 and and

00:02:55.940 --> 00:03:01.900 
just pop up it will be 1.2.3 and and
yeah<00:02:56.940> so<00:02:57.480> once<00:02:57.720> you<00:02:57.870> have<00:02:58.110> that<00:02:58.170> you<00:02:58.530> can<00:02:58.710> play
