00:01:29.690 --> 00:01:29.700 
dark color is everything needs to be

00:01:29.700 --> 00:01:32.179

00:01:34.580 --> 00:01:34.590 
sort of technique and at first it can

00:01:34.590 --> 00:01:35.870 
sort of technique and at first it can
look<00:01:34.709> a<00:01:34.799> little<00:01:34.950> bit<00:01:35.130> scary<00:01:35.459> you<00:01:35.579> may<00:01:35.700> look<00:01:35.819> a
