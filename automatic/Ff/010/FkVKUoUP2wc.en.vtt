00:01:16.340 --> 00:01:16.350 
on what they did but keeping that in

00:01:16.350 --> 00:01:19.100 
on what they did but keeping that in
mind<00:01:16.380> if<00:01:16.860> if<00:01:17.159> the<00:01:18.000> number<00:01:18.390> comes<00:01:18.659> out<00:01:18.810> because

mind if if the number comes out because

00:01:19.110 --> 00:01:21.109 
mind if if the number comes out because
you<00:01:19.170> figure<00:01:19.500> that<00:01:20.040> if<00:01:20.159> they<00:01:20.280> did<00:01:20.460> more<00:01:20.759> than

you figure that if they did more than
TNA<00:01:21.720> did<00:01:21.960> that<00:01:22.200> means<00:01:22.770> they<00:01:22.950> did<00:01:23.100> somewhere<00:01:23.580> in

00:01:23.810 --> 00:01:23.820 
TNA did that means they did somewhere in

00:01:23.820 --> 00:01:27.230 
TNA did that means they did somewhere in
excess<00:01:24.180> of<00:01:24.299> 52<00:01:24.960> probably<00:01:25.409> I'd<00:01:26.369> say<00:01:26.400> seventy

00:01:27.230 --> 00:01:27.240 
excess of 52 probably I'd say seventy

00:01:27.240 --> 00:01:30.380 
excess of 52 probably I'd say seventy
eighty<00:01:27.540> thousand<00:01:28.280> for<00:01:29.280> the<00:01:29.369> buyer<00:01:29.549> by<00:01:30.180> rate

00:01:30.380 --> 00:01:30.390 
eighty thousand for the buyer by rate

00:01:30.390 --> 00:01:32.469 
eighty thousand for the buyer by rate
for<00:01:30.570> that<00:01:30.689> pay-per-view<00:01:30.869> if<00:01:31.409> they<00:01:31.979> did

00:01:32.469 --> 00:01:32.479 
for that pay-per-view if they did

00:01:32.479 --> 00:01:35.330 
for that pay-per-view if they did
seventy<00:01:33.479> to<00:01:33.600> eighty<00:01:33.920> thousand<00:01:34.920> I<00:01:35.040> would

00:01:35.330 --> 00:01:35.340 
seventy to eighty thousand I would

00:01:35.340 --> 00:01:37.039 
seventy to eighty thousand I would
definitely<00:01:35.490> say<00:01:35.790> that<00:01:35.880> is<00:01:36.150> a<00:01:36.180> huge<00:01:36.540> monstrous

00:01:37.039 --> 00:01:37.049 
definitely say that is a huge monstrous

00:01:37.049 --> 00:01:40.940 
definitely say that is a huge monstrous
success<00:01:37.439> and<00:01:37.829> here's<00:01:38.070> why<00:01:38.310> um<00:01:39.799> that<00:01:40.799> would

00:01:40.940 --> 00:01:40.950 
success and here's why um that would

00:01:40.950 --> 00:01:43.490 
success and here's why um that would
basically<00:01:41.100> put<00:01:41.729> them<00:01:41.909> on<00:01:42.060> par<00:01:42.329> when<00:01:43.110> they<00:01:43.259> when

00:04:52.040 --> 00:04:52.050 
seems like an odd pairing except that

00:04:52.050 --> 00:04:56.240 
seems like an odd pairing except that
both<00:04:52.350> of<00:04:52.380> angle<00:04:53.100> Andrew<00:04:53.460> so<00:04:53.730> if<00:04:54.740> the<00:04:55.740> report<00:04:56.160> is

00:04:56.240 --> 00:04:56.250 
both of angle Andrew so if the report is

00:04:56.250 --> 00:04:57.800 
both of angle Andrew so if the report is
correct<00:04:56.460> and<00:04:56.820> this<00:04:56.940> is<00:04:57.060> all<00:04:57.180> rumor<00:04:57.570> and<00:04:57.690> back

00:04:57.800 --> 00:04:57.810 
correct and this is all rumor and back

00:04:57.810 --> 00:04:59.060 
correct and this is all rumor and back
state<00:04:58.020> except<00:04:58.200> but<00:04:58.380> if<00:04:58.470> the<00:04:58.560> report<00:04:58.980> is

00:04:59.060 --> 00:04:59.070 
state except but if the report is

00:04:59.070 --> 00:05:02.450 
state except but if the report is
correct<00:05:00.020> what<00:05:01.020> they<00:05:01.200> want<00:05:01.530> is<00:05:01.710> to<00:05:02.070> push<00:05:02.280> the

00:05:02.450 --> 00:05:02.460

against this type attitude going in

00:05:26.190 --> 00:05:29.000 
against this type attitude going in
throughout<00:05:26.610> tiene<00:05:27.480> which<00:05:28.200> is<00:05:28.350> very<00:05:28.590> strange

00:05:29.000 --> 00:05:29.010 
throughout tiene which is very strange

00:05:29.010 --> 00:05:30.560 
throughout tiene which is very strange
and<00:05:29.250> very<00:05:29.340> odd<00:05:29.730> and<00:05:30.150> something<00:05:30.540> that

00:05:30.560 --> 00:05:30.570 
and very odd and something that

00:05:30.570 --> 00:05:31.970 
and very odd and something that

00:05:31.970 --> 00:05:31.980 
definitely think has to be kind of

00:05:31.980 --> 00:05:33.590 
definitely think has to be kind of
looked<00:05:32.160> at<00:05:32.340> because<00:05:32.610> we<00:05:33.000> don't<00:05:33.330> really<00:05:33.480> talk

00:05:33.590 --> 00:05:33.600 
looked at because we don't really talk

00:05:38.510 --> 00:05:38.520 
because usually there is nothing really

00:05:38.520 --> 00:05:40.969 
because usually there is nothing really
to<00:05:38.790> talk<00:05:38.970> much<00:05:39.180> about<00:05:39.360> this<00:05:40.140> is<00:05:40.260> a<00:05:40.290> big<00:05:40.500> deal<00:05:40.680> I

00:05:40.969 --> 00:05:40.979 
to talk much about this is a big deal I

00:05:40.979 --> 00:05:42.380 
to talk much about this is a big deal I
mean<00:05:41.190> this<00:05:41.310> is<00:05:41.490> this<00:05:41.700> is<00:05:41.880> one<00:05:42.030> of<00:05:42.060> those<00:05:42.180> things

00:05:42.380 --> 00:05:42.390

they<00:05:42.690> can<00:05:42.900> really<00:05:43.140> hurt<00:05:43.290> a<00:05:43.410> company<00:05:43.800> if<00:05:43.890> they

00:05:44.030 --> 00:05:44.040 
they can really hurt a company if they

00:05:44.040 --> 00:05:46.010 
they can really hurt a company if they
continue<00:05:44.490> to<00:05:44.640> let<00:05:44.790> this<00:05:44.910> go<00:05:45.180> and<00:05:45.450> hopefully

more<00:05:59.490> the<00:05:59.580> established<00:06:00.030> stars<00:06:00.240> because<00:06:00.510> they

00:06:00.590 --> 00:06:00.600 
more the established stars because they

00:06:00.600 --> 00:06:02.890 
more the established stars because they
feel<00:06:00.840> like<00:06:01.100> they're<00:06:02.100> the<00:06:02.220> established<00:06:02.669> stars

00:06:02.890 --> 00:06:02.900

feel like they're the established stars
they're<00:06:03.900> known<00:06:04.140> names<00:06:04.470> and<00:06:04.800> that's<00:06:04.950> why<00:06:05.100> we

00:06:05.210 --> 00:06:05.220 
they're known names and that's why we

00:06:05.220 --> 00:06:07.040 
they're known names and that's why we
have<00:06:05.340> to<00:06:05.460> push<00:06:05.640> them<00:06:05.850> which<00:06:06.360> I<00:06:06.630> think

00:06:07.040 --> 00:06:07.050 
have to push them which I think

00:06:07.050 --> 00:06:08.780

everybody<00:06:07.560> on<00:06:07.710> here<00:06:07.740> will<00:06:08.010> kind<00:06:08.160> of<00:06:08.250> say<00:06:08.460> yes

00:06:08.780 --> 00:06:08.790 
everybody on here will kind of say yes

00:06:08.790 --> 00:06:11.780 
everybody on here will kind of say yes
to<00:06:09.180> an<00:06:09.510> extent<00:06:09.810> but<00:06:10.020> also<00:06:10.169> not<00:06:11.160> to<00:06:11.430> the<00:06:11.520> extent

00:06:11.780 --> 00:06:11.790 
to an extent but also not to the extent

00:06:11.790 --> 00:06:14.210
