00:00:20.060 --> 00:00:20.070 
time you start you're going to use a

00:00:20.070 --> 00:00:22.010 
time you start you're going to use a
behavior<00:00:20.609> that<00:00:20.730> your<00:00:20.850> dog<00:00:21.060> is<00:00:21.090> familiar<00:00:21.750> with

now<00:00:22.769> that<00:00:23.010> we've<00:00:23.130> introduced<00:00:23.580> that<00:00:23.850> concept

00:00:24.470 --> 00:00:24.480 
now that we've introduced that concept

00:00:24.480 --> 00:00:27.529 
now that we've introduced that concept
we<00:00:24.990> can<00:00:25.199> use<00:00:25.350> another<00:00:26.250> position<00:00:26.910> that<00:00:27.390> your

00:00:27.529 --> 00:00:27.539 
we can use another position that your

00:00:27.539 --> 00:00:29.870 
we can use another position that your
dog<00:00:27.750> might<00:00:28.050> be<00:00:28.260> less<00:00:28.680> familiar<00:00:28.710> with<00:00:29.310> and<00:00:29.550> that

00:00:29.870 --> 00:00:29.880 
dog might be less familiar with and that

00:00:29.880 --> 00:00:32.359 
dog might be less familiar with and that
would<00:00:30.029> be<00:00:30.060> the<00:00:30.179> down<00:00:30.539> or<00:00:30.960> the<00:00:31.349> stand<00:00:31.710> for<00:00:32.189> most

00:00:32.359 --> 00:00:32.369 
would be the down or the stand for most

00:01:56.560 --> 00:01:56.570 
and they hold that position so you can

00:01:56.570 --> 00:01:58.450
