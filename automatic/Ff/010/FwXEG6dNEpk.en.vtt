Randy<00:00:23.090> Randy<00:00:23.510> and<00:00:23.830> those<00:00:24.830> in<00:00:25.100> my<00:00:25.220> ear<00:00:25.400> I<00:00:25.430> was

00:00:25.720 --> 00:00:25.730 
Randy Randy and those in my ear I was

00:00:25.730 --> 00:00:27.279 
Randy Randy and those in my ear I was
talking<00:00:26.060> to<00:00:26.119> me<00:00:26.210> about<00:00:26.420> what<00:00:26.630> he's<00:00:26.750> saying<00:00:26.779> out

talking to me about what he's saying out

00:00:27.289 --> 00:00:33.189 
talking to me about what he's saying out
there<00:00:29.019> I<00:00:30.099> think<00:00:31.099> he's<00:00:31.220> been<00:00:32.080> accepting<00:00:33.080> his

00:00:33.189 --> 00:00:33.199 
there I think he's been accepting his

00:00:33.199 --> 00:00:35.530 
there I think he's been accepting his
role<00:00:33.440> Tom<00:00:33.739> this<00:00:34.579> responsibility<00:00:35.180> on<00:00:35.450> this

00:00:35.530 --> 00:00:35.540 
role Tom this responsibility on this

00:00:35.540 --> 00:00:43.360 
role Tom this responsibility on this
chamber<00:00:35.989> because<00:00:41.290> and<00:00:42.290> make<00:00:42.469> plays<00:00:42.739> and<00:00:42.770> he's

00:00:43.360 --> 00:00:43.370 
chamber because and make plays and he's

00:00:43.370 --> 00:00:44.770 
chamber because and make plays and he's
that<00:00:43.550> he<00:00:43.700> hasn't<00:00:43.940> really<00:00:44.120> been<00:00:44.239> able<00:00:44.390> to<00:00:44.540> do

00:00:44.770 --> 00:00:44.780 
that he hasn't really been able to do

00:00:44.780 --> 00:00:48.880 
that he hasn't really been able to do
that<00:00:44.960> so<00:00:45.879> it's<00:00:46.879> just<00:00:47.750> working<00:00:48.170> with<00:00:48.559> him<00:00:48.739> as

00:00:48.880 --> 00:00:48.890 
that so it's just working with him as

00:00:48.890 --> 00:00:54.220 
that so it's just working with him as
far<00:00:49.100> as<00:00:51.940> I'm<00:00:52.940> not<00:00:53.149> used<00:00:53.420> to<00:00:53.539> seeing<00:00:53.840> myself

00:00:58.720 --> 00:00:58.730 
play this role and I think that what I'm

00:00:58.730 --> 00:01:01.389 
play this role and I think that what I'm
used<00:00:59.000> to<00:00:59.090> seeing<00:00:59.360> is<00:00:59.829> you<00:01:00.829> know<00:01:00.980> the<00:01:01.129> plays

00:01:01.389 --> 00:01:01.399 
used to seeing is you know the plays

00:01:01.399 --> 00:01:04.180 
used to seeing is you know the plays
that<00:01:01.430> that<00:01:02.149> that<00:01:02.480> I<00:01:02.539> do<00:01:02.629> get<00:01:03.109> or<00:01:03.410> you<00:01:04.039> know<00:01:04.160> a

00:01:04.180 --> 00:01:04.190 
that that that I do get or you know a

00:01:04.190 --> 00:01:05.830 
that that that I do get or you know a
catch<00:01:04.610> or<00:01:04.820> something<00:01:05.149> like<00:01:05.239> I<00:01:05.420> think<00:01:05.660> now<00:01:05.810> that

00:01:05.830 --> 00:01:05.840 
catch or something like I think now that

00:01:05.840 --> 00:01:08.590 
catch or something like I think now that
I<00:01:06.409> understand<00:01:07.400> my<00:01:07.580> role<00:01:07.850> and<00:01:08.000> what<00:01:08.180> I'm<00:01:08.299> doing
