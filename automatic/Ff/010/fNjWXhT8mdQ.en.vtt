00:03:02.680 --> 00:03:02.690 

00:03:02.690 --> 00:03:04.750 

and<00:03:03.170> once<00:03:03.410> these<00:03:03.560> are<00:03:03.740> dead<00:03:03.860> we<00:03:03.980> go<00:03:04.130> directly

00:03:04.750 --> 00:03:04.760 
and once these are dead we go directly

00:03:04.760 --> 00:03:20.840 
and once these are dead we go directly
to<00:03:05.120> the<00:03:05.240> one

00:03:20.840 --> 00:03:20.850 

00:03:20.850 --> 00:03:24.390

00:03:26.040 --> 00:03:26.050 
you can beat it before quills so that's

00:03:26.050 --> 00:03:26.610 
you can beat it before quills so that's
better

00:03:26.610 --> 00:03:26.620 
better

00:03:26.620 --> 00:03:46.880 
better
I<00:03:31.650> go<00:03:32.650> to<00:03:32.710> three<00:03:32.920> here<00:03:33.130> by<00:03:33.250> the<00:03:33.370> way<00:03:33.600> just

00:03:46.880 --> 00:03:46.890 

00:03:46.890 --> 00:03:49.679 

while<00:03:47.890> we<00:03:48.040> go<00:03:48.189> down<00:03:48.400> with<00:03:48.579> this<00:03:48.819> one<00:03:49.030> you<00:03:49.480> can't

00:03:49.679 --> 00:03:49.689 
while we go down with this one you can't

00:03:49.689 --> 00:03:52.050 
while we go down with this one you can't
ever<00:03:49.810> burn<00:03:50.189> like<00:03:51.189> not<00:03:51.340> until<00:03:51.610> really<00:03:51.819> close

00:03:52.050 --> 00:03:52.060 
ever burn like not until really close

00:03:52.060 --> 00:03:56.460 
ever burn like not until really close
like<00:03:52.329> less<00:03:52.659> temperature<00:03:54.810> so<00:03:55.810> my<00:03:55.989> platform

00:03:56.460 --> 00:03:56.470 
like less temperature so my platform

00:03:56.470 --> 00:03:59.039 
like less temperature so my platform
might<00:03:56.680> be<00:03:56.769> the<00:03:56.920> loss<00:03:57.239> we<00:03:58.239> are<00:03:58.390> going<00:03:58.659> to<00:03:58.810> start

00:03:59.039 --> 00:03:59.049 
might be the loss we are going to start

00:03:59.049 --> 00:04:01.710 
might be the loss we are going to start
not<00:03:59.829> yet<00:04:00.010> it's<00:04:00.370> no<00:04:00.579> it's<00:04:00.730> like<00:04:00.909> five<00:04:01.150> seconds

00:04:01.710 --> 00:04:01.720 
not yet it's no it's like five seconds

00:04:01.720 --> 00:04:04.440 
not yet it's no it's like five seconds
yeah<00:04:02.319> yeah<00:04:02.560> so<00:04:03.310> I<00:04:03.370> think<00:04:03.459> probably<00:04:03.730> mine<00:04:04.180> will

00:04:04.440 --> 00:04:04.450 
yeah yeah so I think probably mine will

00:04:04.450 --> 00:04:16.470 
yeah yeah so I think probably mine will
be<00:04:04.480> the<00:04:04.599> last<00:04:04.900> group<00:04:05.439> to<00:04:05.650> go

00:04:16.470 --> 00:04:16.480
