00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.819
 Fucking dude in this video I'll explain 

00:00:03.659 --> 00:00:09.269
 you what's going on in the channel 

00:00:05.819 --> 00:00:11.960
 Why are you having so much live and so little 

00:00:09.269 --> 00:00:11.960
 video 

00:00:15.570 --> 00:00:21.510
 good this mp is having there now from loeb 

00:00:19.619 --> 00:00:23.130
 and the very black boot asking me to 

00:00:21.510 --> 00:00:25.320
 to upgrade rock actually not 

00:00:23.130 --> 00:00:26.849
 a lot of sound and I promised him what to do 

00:00:25.320 --> 00:00:29.279
 So, there's your gameplay. 

00:00:26.849 --> 00:00:31.980
 ok, let's go there, what's going on 

00:00:29.279 --> 00:00:36.360
 galley channel a few weeks ago I 

00:00:31.980 --> 00:00:40.110
 I realized that they will have live videos 

00:00:36.360 --> 00:00:42.510
 I had as much visualization as my 

00:00:40.110 --> 00:00:44.850
 standard videos and recording of the 

00:00:42.510 --> 00:00:46.440
 slabs were not finalized and 

00:00:44.850 --> 00:00:49.379
 normal video medium only one drop 

00:00:46.440 --> 00:00:51.270
 bit and drives sometimes up to 1 with 

00:00:49.379 --> 00:00:53.670
 better rating than this is 

00:00:51.270 --> 00:00:55.980
 there are the videos no longer understood had a 

00:00:53.670 --> 00:00:58.230
 a better evaluation 

00:00:55.980 --> 00:01:00.449
 I thought fucking expected and prefer that 

00:00:58.230 --> 00:01:02.640
 I'd better avoid a better evaluation there. 

00:01:00.449 --> 00:01:07.380
 the same number of net wires waits 

00:01:02.640 --> 00:01:09.479
 You prefer me to live and fucking live 

00:01:07.380 --> 00:01:12.180
 It's so much easier to do to me because 

00:01:09.479 --> 00:01:15.900
 I'll make more video understood 

00:01:12.180 --> 00:01:18.420
 Look at the video, it gives a lot but much more. 

00:01:15.900 --> 00:01:19.560
 work to make me understand the video 

00:01:18.420 --> 00:01:22.110
 I have a lot more work to do 

00:01:19.560 --> 00:01:24.119
 have to dictate what the pa and face is 

00:01:22.110 --> 00:01:26.880
 a lot of things are very time consuming 

00:01:24.119 --> 00:01:29.070
 live is ten times simpler to do 

00:01:26.880 --> 00:01:31.200
 much simpler even just get 

00:01:29.070 --> 00:01:33.090
 do it there and it's already done 

00:01:31.200 --> 00:01:34.979
 automatically she already has the tomato 

00:01:33.090 --> 00:01:35.729
 The mind is everything easier you are. 

00:01:34.979 --> 00:01:38.729
 thinking 

00:01:35.729 --> 00:01:40.560
 thinks you're only doing it there because 

00:01:38.729 --> 00:01:42.570
 It's easier for you, you 're lazy. 

00:01:40.560 --> 00:01:44.970
 No, the guy is not this. 

00:01:42.570 --> 00:01:46.560
 if you prefer live and light it gets more 

00:01:44.970 --> 00:01:49.170
 easy for me to do because I'm not going 

00:01:46.560 --> 00:01:51.990
 do it then, look at this video, I'll go 

00:01:49.170 --> 00:01:54.329
 tell you the advantages of live and 

00:01:51.990 --> 00:01:56.460
 the advantages of video and in the end you 

00:01:54.329 --> 00:01:57.810
 decide what and how it will be 

00:01:56.460 --> 00:02:00.270
 future of the canal 

00:01:57.810 --> 00:02:01.649
 we were there the first advantage of ldu 

00:02:00.270 --> 00:02:04.920
 I'll talk about the benefit of ldu and 

00:02:01.649 --> 00:02:07.619
 first interaction is very bad even 

00:02:04.920 --> 00:02:09.270
 because in a video I can not do type 

00:02:07.619 --> 00:02:11.819
 to send you into the game 

00:02:09.270 --> 00:02:13.690
 play together and I can not there I twist 

00:02:11.819 --> 00:02:15.250
 every now and then I'm going to do the galley 

00:02:13.690 --> 00:02:17.860
 everybody enters this brazilian game 

00:02:15.250 --> 00:02:20.080
 This has already been done and then the game with all 

00:02:17.860 --> 00:02:21.160
 you guys this is a star advantage 

00:02:20.080 --> 00:02:23.200
 that I will never be able to make a 

00:02:21.160 --> 00:02:25.690
 video understood this interaction very 

00:02:23.200 --> 00:02:26.380
 The biggest we have on live the second 

00:02:25.690 --> 00:02:28.900
 advantage 

00:02:26.380 --> 00:02:31.810
 the videos are much bigger it can be a 

00:02:28.900 --> 00:02:35.320
 advantage and a disadvantage but videos 

00:02:31.810 --> 00:02:38.680
 live are much bigger even this is good 

00:02:35.320 --> 00:02:40.630
 face by a guy who likes type optitron 

00:02:38.680 --> 00:02:42.160
 the 12-minute video is the guy sees a 

00:02:40.630 --> 00:02:44.590
 he finished two minutes video 

00:02:42.160 --> 00:02:47.470
 Be satisfied with the live does not relieve you 

00:02:44.590 --> 00:02:50.140
 one hour he sees the beginning of the video 

00:02:47.470 --> 00:02:51.460
 speak put're boring it can advance type 

00:02:50.140 --> 00:02:53.320
 The 20 minutes that I'll be already 

00:02:51.460 --> 00:02:55.630
 doing something totally different he 

00:02:53.320 --> 00:02:58.090
 like this part did not like the 

00:02:55.630 --> 00:03:00.460
 booing jumps over 20 minutes understood 

00:02:58.090 --> 00:03:04.030
 This guy is much easier and has 

00:03:00.460 --> 00:03:06.910
 much more variety the third advantage 

00:03:04.030 --> 00:03:09.460
 I answer the questions on live a lot. 

00:03:06.910 --> 00:03:11.380
 easier while the engine is running 

00:03:09.460 --> 00:03:13.690
 people ask me a lot and do not even 

00:03:11.380 --> 00:03:15.430
 I can always answer because busy or 

00:03:13.690 --> 00:03:17.590
 because if she high or eating someone 

00:03:15.430 --> 00:03:19.239
 this sort of thing then respond 

00:03:17.590 --> 00:03:22.090
 question on live is much easier 

00:03:19.239 --> 00:03:25.930
 even with this advantage greater quantity 

00:03:22.090 --> 00:03:27.640
 face live if I only live fizesem 

00:03:25.930 --> 00:03:30.040
 do not do video I did is much less 

00:03:27.640 --> 00:03:31.930
 video I'm going to make 6 type lives by 

00:03:30.040 --> 00:03:34.330
 The week I'm currently doing 

00:03:31.930 --> 00:03:36.459
 I do much lighter even this is 

00:03:34.330 --> 00:03:39.100
 very cool fell I love doing there I like it 

00:03:36.459 --> 00:03:41.500
 Fucking same fifth biggest advantage 

00:03:39.100 --> 00:03:43.750
 informality a video not that the video 

00:03:41.500 --> 00:03:45.370
 be formal but do not take I have a lot 

00:03:43.750 --> 00:03:46.390
 more informality because I do not know the 

00:03:45.370 --> 00:03:48.220
 what is to come 

00:03:46.390 --> 00:03:49.840
 I can not cut then if you 

00:03:48.220 --> 00:03:52.540
 You are in my room making my 

00:03:49.840 --> 00:03:54.850
 brother come in here you guys are like talking 

00:03:52.540 --> 00:03:57.160
 With my brother I can put him here. 

00:03:54.850 --> 00:04:00.310
 for you to know this kind of thing 

00:03:57.160 --> 00:04:03.190
 understood the informality is much greater 

00:04:00.310 --> 00:04:06.010
 okay advantage of the video first 

00:04:03.190 --> 00:04:07.690
 video quality is much higher than 

00:04:06.010 --> 00:04:10.600
 quality there is much lower even 

00:04:07.690 --> 00:04:12.340
 fighting doing light type at 720p 

00:04:10.600 --> 00:04:14.110
 It's what I 'm doing these days. 

00:04:12.340 --> 00:04:17.230
 much lower even 

00:04:14.110 --> 00:04:19.299
 the second advantage of videos my punch the 

00:04:17.230 --> 00:04:21.370
 video is much more focused example I 

00:04:19.299 --> 00:04:23.860
 I want to make a video of the drip in the media is 

00:04:21.370 --> 00:04:25.930
 the title gotti media and make the 12 

00:04:23.860 --> 00:04:26.410
 minutes of video teaching you to 

00:04:25.930 --> 00:04:28.450
 do the 

00:04:26.410 --> 00:04:30.280
 The team already there I can not do this 

00:04:28.450 --> 00:04:32.650
 understood it light until I can do something 

00:04:30.280 --> 00:04:34.270
 similar but will stay in 1 minute nothing 

00:04:32.650 --> 00:04:36.510
 see I'll answer other 

00:04:34.270 --> 00:04:39.790
 questions that have nothing comes with oo 

00:04:36.510 --> 00:04:42.310
 onlive is much more comprehensive the video is 

00:04:39.790 --> 00:04:44.380
 much more focused and third at will 

00:04:42.310 --> 00:04:46.390
 the videos are more organized 

00:04:44.380 --> 00:04:48.190
 on the video can rehearse before 

00:04:46.390 --> 00:04:49.870
 I'll type this video now, I'm 

00:04:48.190 --> 00:04:51.640
 doing for the second time 

00:04:49.870 --> 00:04:53.410
 I kind of quit before I start 

00:04:51.640 --> 00:04:55.600
 to make him understand, I do not really know 

00:04:53.410 --> 00:04:58.210
 Let's be honest, I fucking recorded. 

00:04:55.600 --> 00:05:00.790
 of the whole video and then I saw the phelps 

00:04:58.210 --> 00:05:01.570
 it was not working that franz son of 

00:05:00.790 --> 00:05:04.210
 whore 

00:05:01.570 --> 00:05:05.260
 Good, that's it , now you decide the 

00:05:04.210 --> 00:05:07.300
 what do you want 

00:05:05.260 --> 00:05:09.640
 or you want live or you want video 

00:05:07.300 --> 00:05:13.650
 You want more or less than 2's that's it. 

00:05:09.640 --> 00:05:13.650
 everybody's fucking gone
