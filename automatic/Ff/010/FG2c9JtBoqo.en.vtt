00:00:09.080 --> 00:00:13.830
 before it was if not better then 

00:00:11.639 --> 00:00:16.289
 Exactly easier take the current name 

00:00:13.830 --> 00:00:17.310
 opel insignia meriva models 

00:00:16.289 --> 00:00:19.199
 zafira 

00:00:17.310 --> 00:00:22.350
 who knows what these words are 

00:00:19.199 --> 00:00:25.019
 mean seventy-five years ago screamed 

00:00:22.350 --> 00:00:27.930
 Don't be too smart for your new models. 

00:00:25.019 --> 00:00:29.609
 have chosen a simple name captain first 

00:00:27.930 --> 00:00:31.800
 no one needs to explain anything in 

00:00:29.609 --> 00:00:34.880
 the second gives rise to the right association 

00:00:31.800 --> 00:00:39.239
 reliability and confidence even if sometimes 

00:00:34.880 --> 00:00:41.840
 shakes this car company opel 

00:00:39.239 --> 00:00:44.910
 presented to the world at the Geneva Motor Show 

00:00:41.840 --> 00:00:47.399
 1939 that is about six months before 

00:00:44.910 --> 00:00:49.230
 beginning of the second world war precisely because 

00:00:47.399 --> 00:00:50.820
 war production captain first 

00:00:49.230 --> 00:00:52.710
 generation had to roll 

00:00:50.820 --> 00:00:53.820
 after a year and a half but this 

00:00:52.710 --> 00:00:55.770
 short span 

00:00:53.820 --> 00:00:57.570
 opel in terms of production went on 

00:00:55.770 --> 00:00:58.879
 first place among European 

00:00:57.570 --> 00:01:02.160
 manufacturers 

00:00:58.879 --> 00:01:04.890
 Sau defense for these one and a half years was 

00:01:02.160 --> 00:01:07.080
 collected and sold about 25 thousand models 

00:01:04.890 --> 00:01:10.500
 that for those times was considered big 

00:01:07.080 --> 00:01:12.000
 success and about 30,000 more captains 

00:01:10.500 --> 00:01:14.040
 released after the war 

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:17.240
 finally stopped production 

00:01:14.040 --> 00:01:17.240
 only in the early fifties 

00:01:17.600 --> 00:01:22.320
 no wonder are similar in size and 

00:01:20.189 --> 00:01:24.960
 power car brand BMW cost 

00:01:22.320 --> 00:01:26.850
 then 30 percent more expensive and the price 

00:01:24.960 --> 00:01:30.210
 competing model with captain 

00:01:26.850 --> 00:01:32.430
 mercedes was almost double the age of 75 

00:01:30.210 --> 00:01:34.350
 back opel brand strategy was like 

00:01:32.430 --> 00:01:36.090
 on today's offer to the public 

00:01:34.350 --> 00:01:37.470
 the car is relatively inexpensive but 

00:01:36.090 --> 00:01:38.810
 comfortable and in something 

00:01:37.470 --> 00:01:41.659
 innovative 

00:01:38.810 --> 00:01:43.670
 a graph rent for example stove with 

00:01:41.659 --> 00:01:45.500
 fan and dampers using 

00:01:43.670 --> 00:01:47.600
 which regulated the air supply 

00:01:45.500 --> 00:01:50.450
 was big news for those times 

00:01:47.600 --> 00:01:51.140
 or mirrors with anti-reflective 

00:01:50.450 --> 00:01:53.360
 coated 

00:01:51.140 --> 00:01:55.929
 by the way because of this captain at one time 

00:01:53.360 --> 00:01:58.159
 was especially popular with skiers 

00:01:55.929 --> 00:01:59.869
 however, with all the innovation 

00:01:58.159 --> 00:02:00.770
 there was no car on it 

00:01:59.869 --> 00:02:02.840
 parts and assemblies 

00:02:00.770 --> 00:02:05.630
 which now seem to us to be something 

00:02:02.840 --> 00:02:08.179
 for granted nuances of design 

00:02:05.630 --> 00:02:09.860
 retro car sometimes it is important to know not 

00:02:08.179 --> 00:02:12.380
 only the person who sits behind him 

00:02:09.860 --> 00:02:14.720
 driving but also neighbors downstream for example 

00:02:12.380 --> 00:02:16.790
 This car turn signals and included in 

00:02:14.720 --> 00:02:19.220
 unusual for us together with this 

00:02:16.790 --> 00:02:21.560
 lever on the front panel and drivers 

00:02:19.220 --> 00:02:25.360
 following cars should look 

00:02:21.560 --> 00:02:25.360
 not at all where they usually look 

00:02:25.540 --> 00:02:29.299
 Yes, and the idea of â€‹â€‹comfort at the end 

00:02:27.980 --> 00:02:32.150
 thirties as you can guess 

00:02:29.299 --> 00:02:34.099
 seriously different from the modern there 

00:02:32.150 --> 00:02:35.650
 constructions captains decisions for which 

00:02:34.099 --> 00:02:38.470
 car press today 

00:02:35.650 --> 00:02:40.819
 automaker would just peck would 

00:02:38.470 --> 00:02:42.590
 Buyers of such cars were people not 

00:02:40.819 --> 00:02:44.600
 poor if they had to translate 

00:02:42.590 --> 00:02:46.700
 something cumbersome not just ordered 

00:02:44.600 --> 00:02:48.440
 truck they tried to stuff a closet 

00:02:46.700 --> 00:02:50.420
 trunk of your own car 

00:02:48.440 --> 00:02:53.510
 so the trunk of modern times 

00:02:50.420 --> 00:02:56.209
 were small and had no standard 

00:02:53.510 --> 00:02:58.340
 layout look loading height 

00:02:56.209 --> 00:03:00.620
 here of course there is no claim but class 

00:02:58.340 --> 00:03:04.150
 there were bags to get them 

00:03:00.620 --> 00:03:04.150
 probably not too convenient 

00:03:04.640 --> 00:03:11.040
 what is interesting as many modern 

00:03:07.319 --> 00:03:12.150
 machines it starts with the button but not the one 

00:03:11.040 --> 00:03:14.969
 which we are used to 

00:03:12.150 --> 00:03:17.249
 Ignition key here too have it too 

00:03:14.969 --> 00:03:19.230
 need to turn but the engine will not start it 

00:03:17.249 --> 00:03:21.629
 it will start if you press the button which 

00:03:19.230 --> 00:03:25.109
 is on the floor it is necessary to press 

00:03:21.629 --> 00:03:32.120
 right toe 

00:03:25.109 --> 00:03:39.000
 right foot pressing the gas pedal would 

00:03:32.120 --> 00:03:41.099
 not this time under the captain's hood 

00:03:39.000 --> 00:03:43.439
 6-cylinder engine with 2 s 

00:03:41.099 --> 00:03:46.109
 half a liter and 55 power 

00:03:43.439 --> 00:03:47.969
 gearbox 4-speed 2 3 

00:03:46.109 --> 00:03:49.980
 gears are equipped with synchronizers 

00:03:47.969 --> 00:03:52.079
 so you can do without double 

00:03:49.980 --> 00:03:56.430
 squeezing the clutch mandatory when driving 

00:03:52.079 --> 00:03:58.560
 on many classic machines here are 55 

00:03:56.430 --> 00:04:01.680
 horsepower with it from the bottom rides very 

00:03:58.560 --> 00:04:03.860
 well I must say sometimes it doesn't matter what 

00:04:01.680 --> 00:04:07.490
 transmission on 

00:04:03.860 --> 00:04:10.670
 you can accelerate with dignity 

00:04:07.490 --> 00:04:12.560
 wonder how unobtrusive 

00:04:10.670 --> 00:04:14.630
 classic cars now even 

00:04:12.560 --> 00:04:18.440
 budget sedan tries to dump on you 

00:04:14.630 --> 00:04:21.530
 a bunch of unnecessary information course heading 

00:04:18.440 --> 00:04:23.270
 RMB temperature crater Vesuvius here 

00:04:21.530 --> 00:04:26.030
 before my eyes only speed and 

00:04:23.270 --> 00:04:31.210
 amount of fuel on those on the road 

00:04:26.030 --> 00:04:31.210
 bored with exotic hands 

00:04:34.360 --> 00:04:38.900
 but the dynamics of the car such that 

00:04:36.980 --> 00:04:40.610
 in modern times the speedometer looks 

00:04:38.900 --> 00:04:42.650
 rather an ornament than a source 

00:04:40.610 --> 00:04:44.480
 useful information behind the wheel of this car 

00:04:42.650 --> 00:04:46.520
 not easy to lose rights for 

00:04:44.480 --> 00:04:48.140
 speeding even at the time of descent 

00:04:46.520 --> 00:04:50.240
 from conveyor maximum speed 

00:04:48.140 --> 00:04:52.550
 captain did not exceed one hundred twenty five 

00:04:50.240 --> 00:04:55.130
 kilometers per hour and to disperse hundreds 

00:04:52.550 --> 00:04:57.080
 the car was spending half a minute now even 

00:04:55.130 --> 00:04:59.650
 the weakest course does it 

00:04:57.080 --> 00:05:01.720
 exercise twice as fast 

00:04:59.650 --> 00:05:04.449
 in this machine there is one option which 

00:05:01.720 --> 00:05:06.550
 deprived now and for sure in the foreseeable 

00:05:04.449 --> 00:05:07.360
 the future will be deprived of all new 

00:05:06.550 --> 00:05:10.830
 cars 

00:05:07.360 --> 00:05:14.320
 it springs things to do 

00:05:10.830 --> 00:05:17.259
 indescribable homely atmosphere and she 

00:05:14.320 --> 00:05:19.750
 certainly much nicer and more delicate 

00:05:17.259 --> 00:05:22.720
 what is the business atmosphere of modern 

00:05:19.750 --> 00:05:24.580
 cars in motion with captain 

00:05:22.720 --> 00:05:27.100
 mastering faster than with many 

00:05:24.580 --> 00:05:29.199
 other classic leash machines 

00:05:27.100 --> 00:05:31.389
 hoppel more let distant but 

00:05:29.199 --> 00:05:33.039
 similarities with modern cars on 

00:05:31.389 --> 00:05:35.470
 turn the steering wheel the car responds without 

00:05:33.039 --> 00:05:37.710
 special delays drama backdrop is not oak 

00:05:35.470 --> 00:05:39.880
 and allow you to confidently dispense effort 

00:05:37.710 --> 00:05:41.770
 by the way one could expect from this 

00:05:39.880 --> 00:05:42.880
 car that cornering he will 

00:05:41.770 --> 00:05:46.510
 roll over 

00:05:42.880 --> 00:05:51.070
 much like where are you going miss me i 

00:05:46.510 --> 00:05:53.560
 older than you for 70 years why you need to watch 

00:05:51.070 --> 00:05:55.270
 so it is for exchange rate stability gently 

00:05:53.560 --> 00:05:57.070
 swaying on bumps car 

00:05:55.270 --> 00:05:58.630
 and strives to slip into the next 

00:05:57.070 --> 00:06:01.120
 row and requires adjusting the course 

00:05:58.630 --> 00:06:02.979
 constant steering me no matter how 

00:06:01.120 --> 00:06:05.110
 this car was good for its time 

00:06:02.979 --> 00:06:07.930
 it must be managed from the true captain skies 

00:06:05.110 --> 00:06:10.210
 attentiveness and confidence 

00:06:07.930 --> 00:06:11.919
 advanced modern motorists 

00:06:10.210 --> 00:06:13.990
 who can't imagine life without 

00:06:11.919 --> 00:06:16.030
 active cruise control or system 

00:06:13.990 --> 00:06:18.460
 monitoring of dead zones phrases 

00:06:16.030 --> 00:06:20.860
 opel Captain nothing speaks but does not 

00:06:18.460 --> 00:06:22.449
 it's worth forgetting that the captains are 8 different 

00:06:20.860 --> 00:06:25.720
 generations off the assembly line to 

00:06:22.449 --> 00:06:27.639
 Over a little more than 30 years, if all 

00:06:25.720 --> 00:06:30.039
 the names that opel use now for 

00:06:27.639 --> 00:06:32.400
 their models will live to their 30 

00:06:30.039 --> 00:06:32.400
 summer anniversary
