so<00:00:20.930> far<00:00:21.140> I<00:00:21.170> have<00:00:21.500> twelve<00:00:21.950> eleven<00:00:22.870> nine<00:00:25.150> twelve

00:00:26.140 --> 00:00:26.150 
so far I have twelve eleven nine twelve

00:00:26.150 --> 00:00:33.520 
so far I have twelve eleven nine twelve
eleven<00:00:27.020> ten<00:00:27.050> and<00:00:27.680> nine<00:00:29.020> but<00:00:32.350> but<00:00:33.350> I'm<00:00:33.440> gonna

00:00:33.520 --> 00:00:33.530 
eleven ten and nine but but I'm gonna

00:00:33.530 --> 00:00:35.320 
eleven ten and nine but but I'm gonna
try<00:00:33.710> to<00:00:33.770> collect<00:00:34.160> them<00:00:34.280> all<00:00:34.400> I<00:00:34.640> think<00:00:34.940> it'll<00:00:35.240> be

00:00:35.320 --> 00:00:35.330 
try to collect them all I think it'll be

00:00:35.330 --> 00:00:36.940 
try to collect them all I think it'll be
a<00:00:35.360> challenge<00:00:35.630> and<00:00:36.140> it'll<00:00:36.320> probably<00:00:36.500> cost<00:00:36.740> a

00:00:36.940 --> 00:00:36.950 
a challenge and it'll probably cost a

00:00:36.950 --> 00:00:42.700 
a challenge and it'll probably cost a
lot<00:00:37.040> of<00:00:37.100> money<00:00:37.420> but<00:00:39.370> whatever<00:00:41.110> so<00:00:42.110> this<00:00:42.410> side

00:00:42.700 --> 00:00:42.710 
lot of money but whatever so this side

00:00:42.710 --> 00:00:44.790 
lot of money but whatever so this side

then I have some apples and carrots over
there<00:02:16.150> but<00:02:16.900> I<00:02:16.959> made<00:02:17.110> this<00:02:17.230> little<00:02:17.500> bridge<00:02:17.709> over

00:02:18.030 --> 00:02:18.040

00:02:18.040 --> 00:02:20.250 
there but I made this little bridge over
the<00:02:18.129> water<00:02:18.310> and<00:02:19.269> I<00:02:19.330> think<00:02:19.569> that<00:02:19.840> turned<00:02:19.989> out

00:02:20.250 --> 00:02:20.260 
the water and I think that turned out

00:02:20.260 --> 00:02:24.119
