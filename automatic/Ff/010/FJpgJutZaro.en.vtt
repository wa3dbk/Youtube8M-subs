00:00:00.510 --> 00:00:05.370
 you should accelerate strongly towards 

00:00:02.489 --> 00:00:06.779
 up but only a second and that's how it is 

00:00:05.370 --> 00:00:09.270
 how are the inertia to save the 

00:00:06.779 --> 00:00:11.250
 gas consumption you say it as if it were 

00:00:09.270 --> 00:00:14.480
 so easy of course for someone from 

00:00:11.250 --> 00:00:14.480
 a level that is not complicated 

00:00:14.630 --> 00:00:19.750
 then do not forget it and it's that 

00:00:16.250 --> 00:00:22.630
 you really want to be a soldier 

00:00:19.750 --> 00:00:27.039
 yes it would be fantastic to enter the power 

00:00:22.630 --> 00:00:31.650
 work for the king would be an honor 

00:00:27.039 --> 00:00:31.650
 hey frame already stops lying 

00:00:32.020 --> 00:00:35.680
 and the truth of a good time just 

00:00:34.240 --> 00:00:37.330
 you want to be a soldier to live 

00:00:35.680 --> 00:00:39.940
 comfortably in the castle is not like that 

00:00:37.330 --> 00:00:42.340
 but if I'm telling you the truth like this 

00:00:39.940 --> 00:00:45.430
 that always comfortable 

00:00:42.340 --> 00:00:47.320
 5 years ago this place was also part 

00:00:45.430 --> 00:00:51.150
 of the interior 

00:00:47.320 --> 00:00:51.150
 what are you doing? 

00:00:51.710 --> 00:00:56.020
 he is so simple 

00:00:53.680 --> 00:00:58.530
 that you would be just as comfortable wherever 

00:00:56.020 --> 00:00:58.530
 you go 

00:01:00.980 --> 00:01:05.840
 you do not think it's crazy to learn to 

00:01:04.280 --> 00:01:07.930
 kill titans so that in the end 

00:01:05.840 --> 00:01:11.600
 let's just run away from them 

00:01:07.930 --> 00:01:13.600
 that does not matter to you, I'm also 

00:01:11.600 --> 00:01:16.190
 willing to follow this damn game 

00:01:13.600 --> 00:01:18.620
 You bastard, you're just a child 

00:01:16.190 --> 00:01:21.430
 talkative 

00:01:18.620 --> 00:01:21.430
 it's enough 

00:01:24.580 --> 00:01:30.070
 I 'm with her more if it happens to you already 

00:01:27.790 --> 00:01:33.720
 calm down 

00:01:30.070 --> 00:01:33.720
 and what are you talking about 

00:01:48.600 --> 00:01:51.320
 but all the rest 

00:01:52.650 --> 00:01:57.080
 I will use my skills to solve the 

00:01:54.990 --> 00:01:59.710
 situation 

00:01:57.080 --> 00:01:59.710
 do not 

00:01:59.760 --> 00:02:02.270
 i 

00:02:04.860 --> 00:02:10.319
 what the hell did you do 

00:02:08.310 --> 00:02:13.849
 that was a movement that I learned 

00:02:10.319 --> 00:02:13.849
 while wasting time 

00:02:14.980 --> 00:02:24.209
 If you think that reality is just living 

00:02:17.440 --> 00:02:24.209
 comfortably as you can call yourself a soldier
