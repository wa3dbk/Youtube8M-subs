00:03:40.240 --> 00:03:40.250 
that in now it's time to work with our

00:03:40.250 --> 00:03:43.780 
that in now it's time to work with our
Apple<00:03:40.989> now<00:03:41.989> you<00:03:42.560> want<00:03:42.739> to<00:03:42.830> try<00:03:42.980> to<00:03:43.040> get<00:03:43.310> your

00:03:43.780 --> 00:03:43.790 
Apple now you want to try to get your

00:03:43.790 --> 00:03:46.720 
Apple now you want to try to get your
Apple<00:03:44.209> diced<00:03:44.570> up<00:03:44.870> nice<00:03:45.739> and<00:03:45.770> small<00:03:46.220> into<00:03:46.520> nice

00:03:46.720 --> 00:03:46.730 
Apple diced up nice and small into nice

00:03:46.730 --> 00:03:49.270 
Apple diced up nice and small into nice
bite-sized<00:03:47.239> pieces<00:03:47.450> so<00:03:48.290> let's<00:03:48.860> give<00:03:49.070> it<00:03:49.100> a

00:03:49.270 --> 00:03:49.280 
bite-sized pieces so let's give it a

00:03:49.280 --> 00:03:53.110 
bite-sized pieces so let's give it a
chop<00:03:49.580> down<00:03:49.910> the<00:03:50.690> middle<00:03:50.900> so<00:03:51.770> let's<00:03:52.250> do<00:03:52.970> that

00:03:53.110 --> 00:03:53.120 
chop down the middle so let's do that

00:03:53.120 --> 00:03:57.280 
chop down the middle so let's do that
into<00:03:53.570> a<00:03:54.170> quarter<00:03:55.040> right<00:03:55.220> there<00:03:55.459> and<00:03:56.290> you

00:03:57.280 --> 00:03:57.290 
into a quarter right there and you

00:03:57.290 --> 00:04:00.550 
into a quarter right there and you
definitely<00:03:57.800> do<00:03:58.580> not<00:03:58.610> want<00:03:59.030> this<00:03:59.360> pot<00:03:59.930> the

00:04:00.550 --> 00:04:00.560 
definitely do not want this pot the

00:04:00.560 --> 00:04:02.860 
definitely do not want this pot the
middle<00:04:00.830> so<00:04:01.370> just<00:04:01.760> chop<00:04:01.970> out<00:04:02.180> as<00:04:02.300> much<00:04:02.570> as<00:04:02.750> you

00:04:02.860 --> 00:04:02.870 
middle so just chop out as much as you

00:04:02.870 --> 00:04:06.660 
middle so just chop out as much as you
can<00:04:03.050> from<00:04:03.110> that<00:04:03.620> as<00:04:04.130> best<00:04:04.370> as<00:04:04.610> you<00:04:04.640> can<00:04:04.760> and

00:04:06.660 --> 00:04:06.670 
can from that as best as you can and

00:04:06.670 --> 00:04:08.770 
can from that as best as you can and
make<00:04:07.670> sure<00:04:07.700> it<00:04:07.970> doesn't<00:04:08.120> fall<00:04:08.269> in<00:04:08.660> your

00:04:08.770 --> 00:04:08.780 
make sure it doesn't fall in your

00:04:08.780 --> 00:04:12.130 
make sure it doesn't fall in your
pancake<00:04:09.230> mixture<00:04:09.620> and<00:04:10.130> then<00:04:10.900> you<00:04:11.900> want<00:04:12.019> to

00:04:12.130 --> 00:04:12.140 
pancake mixture and then you want to

00:04:12.140 --> 00:04:15.000 
pancake mixture and then you want to
chop<00:04:12.410> it<00:04:12.440> up<00:04:12.620> into<00:04:12.799> small<00:04:13.390> bite-sized<00:04:14.390> pieces

00:04:15.000 --> 00:04:15.010 
chop it up into small bite-sized pieces

00:04:15.010 --> 00:04:18.310 
chop it up into small bite-sized pieces
just<00:04:16.010> like<00:04:16.130> that<00:04:16.430> that's<00:04:17.239> actually<00:04:17.479> a<00:04:17.750> bit<00:04:18.080> too

00:04:18.310 --> 00:04:18.320 
just like that that's actually a bit too

00:04:18.320 --> 00:04:20.890 
just like that that's actually a bit too
big<00:04:18.620> so<00:04:19.400> you<00:04:19.430> might<00:04:19.910> actually<00:04:20.150> want<00:04:20.479> to<00:04:20.570> cut<00:04:20.780> it

00:04:20.890 --> 00:04:20.900 
big so you might actually want to cut it

00:04:20.900 --> 00:04:23.440 
big so you might actually want to cut it
in<00:04:21.049> two<00:04:21.220> more<00:04:22.220> pieces<00:04:22.490> like<00:04:22.850> that<00:04:22.880> down<00:04:23.240> the

00:04:23.440 --> 00:04:23.450 
in two more pieces like that down the

00:04:23.450 --> 00:04:25.240 
in two more pieces like that down the
middle<00:04:23.630> and<00:04:23.960> you<00:04:24.080> want<00:04:24.380> to<00:04:24.470> work<00:04:24.590> fast<00:04:24.950> with

00:04:25.240 --> 00:04:25.250 
middle and you want to work fast with

00:04:25.250 --> 00:04:28.360 
middle and you want to work fast with
apples<00:04:25.700> because<00:04:26.000> apples<00:04:26.870> tend<00:04:27.169> to<00:04:27.410> get<00:04:27.979> brown

00:04:28.360 --> 00:04:28.370 
apples because apples tend to get brown

00:04:28.370 --> 00:04:31.719 
apples because apples tend to get brown
pretty<00:04:28.820> quickly<00:04:30.010> and<00:04:31.010> while<00:04:31.280> you're<00:04:31.310> chopping

00:04:31.719 --> 00:04:31.729 
pretty quickly and while you're chopping

00:04:31.729 --> 00:04:34.510 
pretty quickly and while you're chopping
your<00:04:31.940> Apple<00:04:32.300> we<00:04:32.479> can<00:04:32.720> you<00:04:33.020> know<00:04:33.169> sing<00:04:33.560> got<00:04:34.340> the

00:04:34.510 --> 00:04:34.520 
your Apple we can you know sing got the

00:04:34.520 --> 00:04:37.360 
your Apple we can you know sing got the
apple<00:04:35.000> bottom<00:04:35.479> jeans<00:04:35.780> boots<00:04:36.650> with<00:04:37.160> the<00:04:37.190> fur

00:04:37.360 --> 00:04:37.370 
apple bottom jeans boots with the fur

00:04:37.370 --> 00:04:42.520 
apple bottom jeans boots with the fur
with<00:04:38.090> the<00:04:38.120> fur<00:04:38.330> and<00:04:39.190> rolled<00:04:40.190> up<00:04:41.229> the<00:04:42.229> fourth

00:04:42.520 --> 00:04:42.530 
with the fur and rolled up the fourth

00:04:42.530 --> 00:04:46.030 
with the fur and rolled up the fourth
step<00:04:42.860> is<00:04:42.919> to<00:04:44.140> well<00:04:45.140> basically<00:04:45.710> it's<00:04:45.919> no

00:04:46.030 --> 00:04:46.040 
step is to well basically it's no

00:04:46.040 --> 00:04:47.500 
step is to well basically it's no
different<00:04:46.220> than<00:04:46.400> what's<00:04:46.669> on<00:04:46.910> the<00:04:47.330> screen

00:04:47.500 --> 00:04:47.510 
different than what's on the screen

00:04:47.510 --> 00:04:51.340 
different than what's on the screen
right<00:04:47.750> now<00:04:47.810> so<00:04:48.290> good<00:04:48.770> luck

so<00:04:52.350> I'm<00:04:52.650> going<00:04:52.860> to<00:04:53.040> start<00:04:53.310> up<00:04:53.550> and<00:04:53.790> pre<00:04:54.570> heat

00:04:54.920 --> 00:04:54.930 
so I'm going to start up and pre heat

00:04:54.930 --> 00:04:57.680 
so I'm going to start up and pre heat
your<00:04:55.199> pan<00:04:55.530> with<00:04:56.280> just<00:04:56.310> a<00:04:56.669> little<00:04:57.000> bit<00:04:57.389> of<00:04:57.510> oil

00:05:00.890 --> 00:05:00.900 
and it's the nonstick pan tiles worry

00:05:00.900 --> 00:05:04.100 
and it's the nonstick pan tiles worry
too<00:05:01.199> much<00:05:01.229> about<00:05:01.500> greasing<00:05:02.400> your<00:05:02.430> pot<00:05:02.820> now<00:05:03.750> for

00:05:04.100 --> 00:05:04.110 
too much about greasing your pot now for

00:05:04.110 --> 00:05:07.040 
too much about greasing your pot now for
the<00:05:04.199> fifth<00:05:04.440> step<00:05:04.910> lower<00:05:05.910> your<00:05:06.180> stovetop<00:05:06.510> heat

00:05:07.040 --> 00:05:07.050 
the fifth step lower your stovetop heat

00:05:07.050 --> 00:05:09.830 
the fifth step lower your stovetop heat
down<00:05:07.320> to<00:05:07.380> medium<00:05:07.979> and<00:05:08.160> ladle<00:05:09.060> out<00:05:09.150> one<00:05:09.449> quarter

00:05:09.830 --> 00:05:09.840 
down to medium and ladle out one quarter

00:05:09.840 --> 00:05:15.080 
down to medium and ladle out one quarter
cup<00:05:10.050> of<00:05:10.199> the<00:05:10.350> pancake<00:05:10.740> mixture<00:05:13.699> that's<00:05:14.699> a<00:05:14.880> lot

00:05:15.080 --> 00:05:15.090 
cup of the pancake mixture that's a lot

00:05:15.090 --> 00:05:17.360 
cup of the pancake mixture that's a lot
more<00:05:15.300> than<00:05:15.449> a<00:05:15.479> quarter<00:05:15.690> but<00:05:16.110> will<00:05:16.350> it<00:05:16.530> and

00:05:17.360 --> 00:05:17.370 
more than a quarter but will it and

00:05:17.370 --> 00:05:21.260 
more than a quarter but will it and
spread<00:05:17.699> it<00:05:17.760> out<00:05:19.220> so<00:05:20.220> now<00:05:20.400> is<00:05:20.639> the<00:05:20.820> bubbles<00:05:21.120> of

00:05:21.260 --> 00:05:21.270 
spread it out so now is the bubbles of

00:05:21.270 --> 00:05:22.909 
spread it out so now is the bubbles of
breaking<00:05:21.720> you<00:05:22.020> want<00:05:22.199> to<00:05:22.290> add<00:05:22.440> your<00:05:22.680> diced
