00:01:17.149 --> 00:01:17.159 
been redesigned the weapons work pretty

00:01:17.159 --> 00:01:20.300 
been redesigned the weapons work pretty
much<00:01:17.280> the<00:01:17.700> same<00:01:17.909> as<00:01:18.299> the<00:01:18.689> weapons<00:01:19.080> and<00:01:19.439> they

00:01:20.300 --> 00:01:20.310 
much the same as the weapons and they

00:01:20.310 --> 00:01:23.899 
much the same as the weapons and they
just<00:01:20.490> look<00:01:20.729> different<00:01:22.310> the<00:01:23.310> operator<00:01:23.700> and<00:01:23.880> the

00:01:23.899 --> 00:01:23.909 
just look different the operator and the

00:01:23.909 --> 00:01:25.730 
just look different the operator and the
same<00:01:24.150> way<00:01:24.360> deal<00:01:24.689> the<00:01:24.810> same<00:01:24.990> sort<00:01:25.259> of<00:01:25.290> damage

00:01:25.730 --> 00:01:25.740 
same way deal the same sort of damage

00:01:25.740 --> 00:01:28.230 
same way deal the same sort of damage
and<00:01:26.310> some<00:01:26.549> are<00:01:26.820> pretty<00:01:26.850> cool

00:01:28.230 --> 00:01:28.240 
and some are pretty cool

00:01:28.240 --> 00:01:31.980 
and some are pretty cool
it's<00:01:29.020> a<00:01:29.079> shame<00:01:29.259> about<00:01:29.290> the<00:01:29.880> enemy<00:01:30.880> models<00:01:31.299> they

00:01:31.980 --> 00:01:31.990 
it's a shame about the enemy models they

00:01:31.990 --> 00:01:35.550 
it's a shame about the enemy models they
don't<00:01:32.229> match<00:01:32.920> the<00:01:33.220> weapons<00:01:33.610> as<00:01:34.439> they<00:01:35.439> don't

00:01:35.550 --> 00:01:35.560 
don't match the weapons as they don't
