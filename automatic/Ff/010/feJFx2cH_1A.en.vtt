lay down to cast up toward the shallow

00:02:45.820 --> 00:02:47.250 
lay down to cast up toward the shallow
side<00:02:46.120> and<00:02:46.450> you'll<00:02:46.540> probably<00:02:46.720> catch<00:02:47.020> fish

00:02:50.280 --> 00:02:50.290 
those fish off the shallow side you may

00:02:50.290 --> 00:02:52.260 
those fish off the shallow side you may
spook<00:02:50.590> fish<00:02:50.830> that<00:02:51.040> were<00:02:51.130> down<00:02:51.310> deeper<00:02:51.730> so

00:02:52.260 --> 00:02:52.270 
spook fish that were down deeper so

00:02:52.270 --> 00:02:53.700 
spook fish that were down deeper so
start<00:02:52.510> off<00:02:52.570> working<00:02:52.960> the<00:02:53.050> deep<00:02:53.230> side<00:02:53.470> of<00:02:53.650> the

00:02:53.700 --> 00:02:53.710 
start off working the deep side of the

start off working the deep side of the
lay<00:02:53.860> down<00:02:54.070> and<00:02:54.310> then<00:02:54.850> if<00:02:55.180> you<00:02:55.300> catch<00:02:55.480> any<00:02:55.750> just

00:02:55.920 --> 00:02:55.930 
lay down and then if you catch any just

00:02:55.930 --> 00:02:57.660 
lay down and then if you catch any just
work<00:02:56.110> your<00:02:56.290> way<00:02:56.380> up<00:02:56.410> that<00:02:57.220> way<00:02:57.400> you'll<00:02:57.550> catch

00:02:57.660 --> 00:02:57.670

group up fish fish and you never know a
lot<00:04:13.280> of<00:04:13.370> times<00:04:13.520> now<00:04:13.790> this<00:04:13.940> is<00:04:14.090> the<00:04:14.209> outside

00:04:14.380 --> 00:04:14.390 
lot of times now this is the outside

00:04:14.390 --> 00:04:16.630 
lot of times now this is the outside
Bend<00:04:14.900> that<00:04:15.019> I<00:04:15.110> caught<00:04:15.290> that<00:04:15.500> fish<00:04:15.709> on<00:04:15.950> a<00:04:16.130> lot<00:04:16.580> of

Bend that I caught that fish on a lot of

00:04:16.640 --> 00:04:18.400 
Bend that I caught that fish on a lot of
times<00:04:16.790> I'll<00:04:16.940> be<00:04:16.970> on<00:04:17.120> the<00:04:17.269> inside<00:04:17.390> Bend<00:04:17.900> the

times I'll be on the inside Bend the

00:04:18.410 --> 00:04:20.590 
times I'll be on the inside Bend the
inside<00:04:18.799> bit<00:04:19.010> of<00:04:19.160> Bend<00:04:19.519> of<00:04:19.669> a<00:04:19.760> creek<00:04:20.000> channel<00:04:20.030> is

00:04:20.590 --> 00:04:20.600 
inside bit of Bend of a creek channel is

00:04:20.600 --> 00:04:22.900 
inside bit of Bend of a creek channel is
going<00:04:20.780> to<00:04:20.840> be<00:04:20.900> the<00:04:21.080> flat<00:04:21.320> side<00:04:21.620> the<00:04:22.340> inside<00:04:22.520> bed

00:04:22.900 --> 00:04:22.910 
going to be the flat side the inside bed

00:04:22.910 --> 00:04:24.790 
going to be the flat side the inside bed
always<00:04:23.210> silts<00:04:23.690> in<00:04:23.840> so<00:04:24.110> it's<00:04:24.260> a<00:04:24.320> lot<00:04:24.500> shallower

00:04:24.790 --> 00:04:24.800 
always silts in so it's a lot shallower

00:04:24.800 --> 00:04:28.090 
always silts in so it's a lot shallower
on<00:04:25.160> the<00:04:25.280> inside<00:04:25.669> part<00:04:26.380> and<00:04:27.380> there's<00:04:27.680> times<00:04:27.919> you

00:04:28.090 --> 00:04:28.100 
on the inside part and there's times you

00:04:28.100 --> 00:04:29.260 
on the inside part and there's times you
know<00:04:28.190> when<00:04:28.400> they're<00:04:28.520> up<00:04:28.669> on<00:04:28.820> those<00:04:28.940> flats

00:04:29.270 --> 00:04:30.790 
know when they're up on those flats
that's<00:04:29.570> the<00:04:29.720> place<00:04:29.900> to<00:04:30.080> fish<00:04:30.290> but<00:04:30.500> we're

00:04:30.790 --> 00:04:30.800

Bend<00:04:32.419> is<00:04:32.570> usually<00:04:32.870> a<00:04:32.900> little<00:04:33.229> bit<00:04:33.380> deeper<00:04:33.820> but

00:04:34.810 --> 00:04:34.820 
Bend is usually a little bit deeper but

00:04:34.820 --> 00:04:36.370 
Bend is usually a little bit deeper but
the<00:04:34.940> neat<00:04:35.120> thing<00:04:35.300> about<00:04:35.390> those<00:04:35.720> bends<00:04:36.140> is<00:04:36.260> you
