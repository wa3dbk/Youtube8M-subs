00:00:45.960 --> 00:00:51.200
 I've been half an hour and I've already been 

00:00:51.210 --> 00:00:58.940
 80 years or something without increasing 

00:00:55.810 --> 00:01:01.840

00:01:06.710 --> 00:01:14.049

00:01:11.119 --> 00:01:14.049
 makes a burrada 

00:01:14.640 --> 00:01:17.570
 too 

00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:23.890
 you could stretch to get this 

00:01:21.500 --> 00:01:23.890
 Spanish 

00:01:24.130 --> 00:01:27.820
 I've been here half an hour 

00:01:28.120 --> 00:01:35.640
 and the reference point that is 

00:01:33.180 --> 00:01:37.730
 states to pink and 

00:01:35.640 --> 00:01:39.770
 and this is the cave 

00:01:37.730 --> 00:01:43.340
 then climb up 

00:01:39.770 --> 00:01:46.910
 up and here find the 55 and in this 

00:01:43.340 --> 00:01:50.240
 peak bridge where they release it where 

00:01:46.910 --> 00:01:54.130
 the radio appeared speaking 

00:01:50.240 --> 00:01:54.130
