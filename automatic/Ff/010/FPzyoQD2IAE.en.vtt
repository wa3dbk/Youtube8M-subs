by light card let's see here's the LBA

00:02:13.230 --> 00:02:15.470 
by light card let's see here's the LBA
20:30<00:02:14.069> hope<00:02:14.310> you<00:02:14.430> guys<00:02:14.580> can<00:02:14.730> see<00:02:14.909> that<00:02:14.940> there

00:02:19.130 --> 00:02:19.140 
if this focus is maybe right there so

00:02:19.140 --> 00:02:21.229 
if this focus is maybe right there so
this<00:02:19.260> is<00:02:19.409> the<00:02:19.500> one<00:02:19.650> I<00:02:19.680> got<00:02:19.920> so<00:02:20.370> I<00:02:20.610> was<00:02:20.790> like<00:02:20.909> okay

00:02:21.229 --> 00:02:21.239 
this is the one I got so I was like okay

00:02:21.239 --> 00:02:22.789 
this is the one I got so I was like okay
let's<00:02:21.480> see<00:02:22.200> how<00:02:22.349> it<00:02:22.470> works

00:02:22.789 --> 00:02:22.799 
let's see how it works

00:02:22.799 --> 00:02:25.699 
let's see how it works
so<00:02:23.549> I<00:02:23.819> put<00:02:24.090> it<00:02:24.180> in<00:02:24.299> here<00:02:24.569> and<00:02:24.720> you<00:02:24.810> know<00:02:25.349> what<00:02:25.530> it

00:02:25.699 --> 00:02:25.709 
so I put it in here and you know what it

00:02:25.709 --> 00:02:29.000 
so I put it in here and you know what it
does<00:02:26.040> not<00:02:26.310> fit<00:02:27.239> it<00:02:27.870> doesn't<00:02:28.230> fit<00:02:28.590> the<00:02:28.769> whole

00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:29.010 
does not fit it doesn't fit the whole

00:02:29.010 --> 00:02:30.559 
does not fit it doesn't fit the whole
pattern<00:02:29.340> and<00:02:29.700> everything<00:02:30.090> I<00:02:30.150> had<00:02:30.330> in<00:02:30.450> there

00:02:30.559 --> 00:02:30.569 
pattern and everything I had in there

00:02:30.569 --> 00:02:32.839 
pattern and everything I had in there
but<00:02:30.720> luckily<00:02:30.959> since<00:02:31.709> I<00:02:31.830> already<00:02:32.040> tried<00:02:32.370> Dremel

00:02:32.839 --> 00:02:32.849 
but luckily since I already tried Dremel

00:02:32.849 --> 00:02:34.670 
but luckily since I already tried Dremel
on<00:02:32.910> this<00:02:33.030> whole<00:02:33.239> thing<00:02:33.510> out<00:02:33.629> to<00:02:34.080> fit<00:02:34.319> one<00:02:34.530> of

00:02:34.670 --> 00:02:34.680 
on this whole thing out to fit one of

00:02:34.680 --> 00:02:37.670 
on this whole thing out to fit one of
these<00:02:34.799> it<00:02:35.549> luckily<00:02:36.269> fit<00:02:36.599> but<00:02:36.840> it<00:02:37.049> doesn't<00:02:37.470> fit

00:02:37.670 --> 00:02:37.680 
these it luckily fit but it doesn't fit

00:02:37.680 --> 00:02:39.740 
these it luckily fit but it doesn't fit
right<00:02:37.980> so<00:02:38.670> what<00:02:38.879> I<00:02:38.910> did<00:02:39.000> is<00:02:39.239> put<00:02:39.420> some<00:02:39.540> red

00:02:39.740 --> 00:02:39.750 
right so what I did is put some red

00:02:39.750 --> 00:02:41.360 
right so what I did is put some red
loctite<00:02:40.019> of<00:02:40.440> where<00:02:40.590> I<00:02:40.620> can<00:02:40.829> get<00:02:40.980> this<00:02:41.099> thing<00:02:41.310> to

00:02:41.360 --> 00:02:41.370 
loctite of where I can get this thing to

00:02:41.370 --> 00:02:43.850 
loctite of where I can get this thing to
stay<00:02:41.670> and<00:02:41.940> just<00:02:42.690> kept<00:02:43.049> it<00:02:43.260> cuz<00:02:43.440> hey<00:02:43.620> you<00:02:43.680> know

00:02:43.850 --> 00:02:43.860 
stay and just kept it cuz hey you know

00:02:43.860 --> 00:02:45.589 
stay and just kept it cuz hey you know
what<00:02:44.040> I'm<00:02:44.400> not<00:02:44.640> even<00:02:44.849> gonna<00:02:44.970> I'm<00:02:45.269> not<00:02:45.299> even

00:02:45.589 --> 00:02:45.599 
what I'm not even gonna I'm not even

00:02:45.599 --> 00:02:47.600 
what I'm not even gonna I'm not even
gonna<00:02:45.720> mess<00:02:45.900> with<00:02:45.930> it<00:02:46.230> and<00:02:46.410> this<00:02:47.099> motor<00:02:47.400> right

00:02:47.600 --> 00:02:47.610 
gonna mess with it and this motor right

00:02:47.610 --> 00:02:49.430 
gonna mess with it and this motor right
here<00:02:47.640> would<00:02:47.940> have<00:02:48.030> been<00:02:48.150> way<00:02:48.510> too<00:02:48.569> much<00:02:49.079> I

00:02:49.430 --> 00:02:49.440 
here would have been way too much I

00:02:49.440 --> 00:02:51.589 
here would have been way too much I
think<00:02:49.860> this<00:02:49.950> is<00:02:50.040> it<00:02:50.129> was<00:02:50.250> like<00:02:50.280> a<00:02:50.370> 8200<00:02:51.120> kV<00:02:51.510> or

00:02:51.589 --> 00:02:51.599 
think this is it was like a 8200 kV or

00:02:51.599 --> 00:02:52.580 
think this is it was like a 8200 kV or
something<00:02:51.870> like<00:02:51.930> that<00:02:51.989> and<00:02:52.230> this<00:02:52.319> one's<00:02:52.500> like

00:02:52.580 --> 00:02:52.590 
something like that and this one's like

00:02:52.590 --> 00:02:55.400 
something like that and this one's like
a<00:02:53.150> 42<00:02:54.150> or<00:02:54.359> something<00:02:54.569> like<00:02:54.629> that<00:02:54.690> and<00:02:55.019> this

00:02:55.400 --> 00:02:55.410 
a 42 or something like that and this

00:02:55.410 --> 00:02:58.580 
a 42 or something like that and this
thing<00:02:55.650> I<00:02:55.950> have<00:02:56.489> to<00:02:56.519> run<00:02:56.790> this<00:02:56.940> thing<00:02:57.150> I<00:02:57.440> have<00:02:58.440> to

00:02:58.580 --> 00:02:58.590 
thing I have to run this thing I have to

00:02:58.590 --> 00:03:01.309 
thing I have to run this thing I have to
run<00:02:58.769> this<00:02:58.950> in<00:02:59.549> Reverse<00:03:00.060> because<00:03:00.390> Ford<00:03:01.019> just

00:03:01.309 --> 00:03:01.319 
run this in Reverse because Ford just

00:03:01.319 --> 00:03:03.770 
run this in Reverse because Ford just
has<00:03:01.500> way<00:03:02.040> too<00:03:02.069> much<00:03:02.430> power<00:03:02.670> so<00:03:02.849> I<00:03:03.329> had<00:03:03.660> to

00:03:03.770 --> 00:03:03.780 
has way too much power so I had to

00:03:03.780 --> 00:03:05.180 
has way too much power so I had to
reverse<00:03:04.049> the<00:03:04.200> polarity<00:03:04.590> on<00:03:04.620> the<00:03:04.829> motor<00:03:05.010> to

00:03:05.180 --> 00:03:05.190 
reverse the polarity on the motor to

00:03:05.190 --> 00:03:07.970 
reverse the polarity on the motor to
give<00:03:05.340> me<00:03:05.519> some<00:03:05.810> -<00:03:06.810> give<00:03:06.959> me<00:03:07.049> some<00:03:07.260> without

00:03:07.970 --> 00:03:07.980 
give me some - give me some without

00:03:07.980 --> 00:03:10.550 
give me some - give me some without
giving<00:03:08.370> so<00:03:08.489> much<00:03:08.609> punch<00:03:09.060> so<00:03:09.480> again<00:03:10.319> you<00:03:10.440> can

00:03:10.550 --> 00:03:10.560 
giving so much punch so again you can

00:03:10.560 --> 00:03:11.630 
giving so much punch so again you can
see<00:03:10.680> how<00:03:10.739> I<00:03:10.799> have<00:03:10.859> everything<00:03:11.129> tucked<00:03:11.519> in

00:03:11.630 --> 00:03:11.640 
see how I have everything tucked in

00:03:11.640 --> 00:03:14.059 
see how I have everything tucked in
there<00:03:11.819> real<00:03:12.030> nice<00:03:12.319> the<00:03:13.319> motor<00:03:13.530> fits<00:03:13.769> in<00:03:13.920> there

00:03:14.059 --> 00:03:14.069 
there real nice the motor fits in there

00:03:14.069 --> 00:03:16.280 
there real nice the motor fits in there
real<00:03:14.280> good<00:03:14.579> this<00:03:14.730> way<00:03:14.970> but<00:03:15.599> again<00:03:15.840> you<00:03:16.109> have<00:03:16.140> to

00:03:16.280 --> 00:03:16.290 
real good this way but again you have to

00:03:16.290 --> 00:03:19.099 
real good this way but again you have to
Dremel<00:03:16.739> this<00:03:16.890> out<00:03:17.099> because<00:03:17.459> the<00:03:17.669> the<00:03:18.239> mounting

00:03:19.099 --> 00:03:19.109 
Dremel this out because the the mounting

00:03:19.109 --> 00:03:21.470 
Dremel this out because the the mounting
holes<00:03:19.319> don't<00:03:19.620> line<00:03:19.739> up<00:03:20.069> and<00:03:20.280> I<00:03:21.030> don't<00:03:21.090> have<00:03:21.329> any

00:03:21.470 --> 00:03:21.480 
holes don't line up and I don't have any

00:03:21.480 --> 00:03:23.330 
holes don't line up and I don't have any
spare<00:03:21.900> spur<00:03:22.530> gears<00:03:22.829> or<00:03:22.950> anything<00:03:23.130> like<00:03:23.280> that

00:03:23.330 --> 00:03:23.340 
spare spur gears or anything like that

00:03:23.340 --> 00:03:25.460 
spare spur gears or anything like that
so<00:03:23.519> I'm<00:03:23.819> waiting<00:03:24.269> to<00:03:24.750> get<00:03:24.900> those<00:03:25.079> before<00:03:25.440> I

00:03:25.460 --> 00:03:25.470 
so I'm waiting to get those before I

00:03:25.470 --> 00:03:27.080 
so I'm waiting to get those before I
really<00:03:25.980> rip<00:03:26.190> on<00:03:26.310> this<00:03:26.459> thing<00:03:26.639> and<00:03:26.730> I<00:03:26.790> took<00:03:26.849> it

00:03:27.080 --> 00:03:27.090 
really rip on this thing and I took it

00:03:27.090 --> 00:03:30.589 
really rip on this thing and I took it
out<00:03:27.209> and<00:03:27.450> it's<00:03:27.900> about<00:03:28.519> 25<00:03:29.519> degrees<00:03:29.730> outside<00:03:30.180> it

00:03:30.589 --> 00:03:30.599 
out and it's about 25 degrees outside it

00:03:30.599 --> 00:03:32.390 
out and it's about 25 degrees outside it
was<00:03:30.690> on<00:03:30.780> a<00:03:30.810> real<00:03:31.049> cold<00:03:31.319> Street<00:03:31.680> it<00:03:32.280> was

00:03:32.390 --> 00:03:32.400 
was on a real cold Street it was

00:03:32.400 --> 00:03:34.220 
was on a real cold Street it was
handling<00:03:32.880> fairly<00:03:33.329> decent<00:03:33.720> I<00:03:33.780> mean<00:03:33.810> nothing

00:03:34.220 --> 00:03:34.230 
handling fairly decent I mean nothing

00:03:34.230 --> 00:03:35.690 
handling fairly decent I mean nothing
spectacular<00:03:34.500> because<00:03:35.190> I<00:03:35.280> didn't<00:03:35.549> really

00:03:35.690 --> 00:03:35.700 
spectacular because I didn't really

00:03:35.700 --> 00:03:36.379 
spectacular because I didn't really
break<00:03:35.910> it<00:03:36.090> in

00:03:36.379 --> 00:03:36.389 
break it in

don't turn the tires too far because

00:03:44.190 --> 00:03:45.440

technically<00:04:48.900> that's<00:04:49.140> reversed<00:04:49.740> because<00:04:49.980> I

00:04:50.360 --> 00:04:50.370 
technically that's reversed because I

00:04:50.370 --> 00:04:57.920 
technically that's reversed because I
did<00:04:50.520> not<00:04:50.610> want<00:04:50.670> to<00:04:50.910> go<00:04:51.060> for<00:04:51.300> now<00:04:51.450> watch<00:04:51.630> this<00:04:56.930> so

00:04:57.920 --> 00:04:57.930 
did not want to go for now watch this so

00:04:57.930 --> 00:05:01.220 
did not want to go for now watch this so
technically<00:04:58.380> that<00:04:58.650> is<00:04:59.040> reversed<00:04:59.540> so<00:05:00.540> I'll<00:05:00.840> I

00:05:01.220 --> 00:05:01.230 
technically that is reversed so I'll I

00:05:01.230 --> 00:05:02.810 
technically that is reversed so I'll I
don't<00:05:01.650> want<00:05:01.800> to<00:05:01.890> go<00:05:01.980> have<00:05:02.310> that<00:05:02.340> much<00:05:02.640> power

00:05:02.810 --> 00:05:02.820 
don't want to go have that much power

00:05:02.820 --> 00:05:05.080 
don't want to go have that much power
because<00:05:03.030> it<00:05:03.180> is<00:05:03.300> just<00:05:03.450> too<00:05:03.600> much<00:05:03.630> to<00:05:03.810> handle<00:05:04.110> so

00:05:05.080 --> 00:05:05.090 
because it is just too much to handle so

00:05:05.090 --> 00:05:08.030 
because it is just too much to handle so
again<00:05:06.090> I<00:05:06.240> recommend<00:05:06.560> watching<00:05:07.560> your<00:05:07.680> throttle

throws here you can see turns real nice

00:05:10.770 --> 00:05:12.770 
throws here you can see turns real nice
here<00:05:11.010> but<00:05:11.040> don't<00:05:11.310> turn<00:05:11.490> it<00:05:11.640> too<00:05:11.790> sharp<00:05:12.180> or<00:05:12.570> else

the<00:05:12.960> the<00:05:13.380> front<00:05:13.650> is<00:05:13.740> gonna<00:05:13.860> catch<00:05:14.190> it<00:05:14.460> and<00:05:14.640> then

00:05:14.750 --> 00:05:14.760 
the the front is gonna catch it and then

00:05:14.760 --> 00:05:16.460 
the the front is gonna catch it and then
Bend<00:05:15.030> in<00:05:15.270> and<00:05:15.480> then<00:05:15.570> make<00:05:15.750> you<00:05:15.870> do<00:05:15.990> like<00:05:16.110> a<00:05:16.140> 180

00:05:16.460 --> 00:05:16.470 
Bend in and then make you do like a 180

00:05:16.470 --> 00:05:18.500 
Bend in and then make you do like a 180
there<00:05:16.890> so<00:05:17.160> does<00:05:17.700> that<00:05:17.730> right<00:05:18.120> there<00:05:18.300> you<00:05:18.330> see
