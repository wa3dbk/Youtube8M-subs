00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:09.480
 and today we are going to teach is going to be 

00:00:07.740 --> 00:00:11.820
 how to make these nails that also 

00:00:09.480 --> 00:00:14.190
 of super chulas are very fun to 

00:00:11.820 --> 00:00:16.519
 do if you want to know how to stay in 

00:00:14.190 --> 00:00:16.519
 the video 

00:00:16.960 --> 00:00:20.369
 a white enamel 

00:00:21.430 --> 00:00:24.630
 a couple of straws 

00:00:24.900 --> 00:00:29.930
 all the colored glazes that 

00:00:27.539 --> 00:00:29.930
 we want 

00:00:30.180 --> 00:00:35.130
 I always start by giving myself a 

00:00:32.400 --> 00:00:37.070
 base the base that I use is the 

00:00:35.130 --> 00:00:42.000
 sense hardener that is this from here 

00:00:37.070 --> 00:00:44.390
 and now we start painting with the base 

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:44.390
 white 

00:00:49.100 --> 00:00:54.420
 well now that we have it dry we go 

00:00:51.620 --> 00:00:59.780
 to start the fun part 

00:00:54.420 --> 00:00:59.780
 we put the straw in pink and blowing 

00:01:18.580 --> 00:01:21.580
 all right 

00:01:33.080 --> 00:01:37.890
 Now let's let it dry and when 

00:01:35.729 --> 00:01:40.700
 be dry let's remove everything 

00:01:37.890 --> 00:01:42.469
 we have around the nail 

00:01:40.700 --> 00:01:45.860
 we have already removed everything we have 

00:01:42.469 --> 00:01:48.460
 outside and now we're going to catch cotton with 

00:01:45.860 --> 00:01:48.460
 a stick 

00:01:50.760 --> 00:01:53.330
 nothing else 

00:01:57.810 --> 00:02:01.520
 we look for nail polish remover 

00:02:02.780 --> 00:02:06.200
 in the corner 

00:02:08.149 --> 00:02:13.640
 once we 've let it dry for a while 

00:02:10.159 --> 00:02:16.730
 reasonable let's take a top coat this 

00:02:13.640 --> 00:02:20.380
 the one that I use is 6 bit and what 

00:02:16.730 --> 00:02:22.570
 does it last us much longer 

00:02:20.380 --> 00:02:26.550
 the enamel that we have put in this 

00:02:22.570 --> 00:02:28.350
 case the drawings we have made spots 

00:02:26.550 --> 00:02:31.770
 and that they know it's a lot more 

00:02:28.350 --> 00:02:33.780
 fast is highly recommended is not cheap 

00:02:31.770 --> 00:02:35.640
 this costs you about seven euros but I 

00:02:33.780 --> 00:02:39.420
 I recommend it because it recommended a 

00:02:35.640 --> 00:02:42.410
 my friend a long time ago and it is a very very 

00:02:39.420 --> 00:02:42.410
 good food 

00:03:09.050 --> 00:03:13.520
 Well, that's how our nails are 

00:03:11.120 --> 00:03:16.370

00:03:13.520 --> 00:03:18.230
