the standard cover driver head that it

00:00:32.460 --> 00:00:34.400 
the standard cover driver head that it
just<00:00:32.669> reminds<00:00:33.149> you<00:00:33.239> it<00:00:33.630> to<00:00:33.899> come<00:00:34.110> from<00:00:34.230> the

00:00:34.400 --> 00:00:34.410 
just reminds you it to come from the

00:00:34.410 --> 00:00:36.049 
just reminds you it to come from the
inside<00:00:34.680> so<00:00:34.920> I<00:00:34.950> quite<00:00:35.219> like<00:00:35.430> that<00:00:35.640> really<00:00:35.820> but

00:00:36.049 --> 00:00:36.059 
inside so I quite like that really but

00:00:36.059 --> 00:00:38.840 
inside so I quite like that really but
the<00:00:36.390> face<00:00:36.780> it<00:00:37.050> seems<00:00:37.320> quite<00:00:37.649> deep<00:00:38.010> as<00:00:38.280> well<00:00:38.730> and

00:00:38.840 --> 00:00:38.850 
the face it seems quite deep as well and

00:00:38.850 --> 00:00:40.970 
the face it seems quite deep as well and
is<00:00:38.969> a<00:00:39.000> smaller<00:00:39.390> head<00:00:39.570> it<00:00:39.719> is<00:00:39.750> a<00:00:39.840> 430<00:00:40.440> head<00:00:40.770> size

00:00:40.970 --> 00:00:40.980 
is a smaller head it is a 430 head size

00:00:40.980 --> 00:00:43.010 
is a smaller head it is a 430 head size
so<00:00:41.160> it<00:00:41.280> does<00:00:41.460> seem<00:00:41.730> quite<00:00:42.300> compact<00:00:42.719> but<00:00:42.870> it

00:00:43.010 --> 00:00:43.020 
so it does seem quite compact but it

00:00:43.020 --> 00:00:45.440 
so it does seem quite compact but it
feels<00:00:43.410> like<00:00:43.590> you're<00:00:44.160> able<00:00:44.280> to<00:00:44.910> really<00:00:45.210> work

00:00:45.440 --> 00:00:45.450 
feels like you're able to really work

00:00:45.450 --> 00:00:47.600 
feels like you're able to really work
the<00:00:45.930> bottom<00:00:46.110> and<00:00:46.440> it<00:00:46.530> feels<00:00:47.039> quite<00:00:47.219> easy<00:00:47.460> to

00:00:47.600 --> 00:00:47.610 
the bottom and it feels quite easy to

00:00:47.610 --> 00:00:49.010 
the bottom and it feels quite easy to
maneuver<00:00:48.180> the<00:00:48.270> club<00:00:48.450> but<00:00:48.539> anyway<00:00:48.719> let's<00:00:48.899> try

00:00:49.010 --> 00:00:49.020 
maneuver the club but anyway let's try

this
this<00:00:49.770> first<00:00:50.039> one<00:00:50.370> see<00:00:50.760> how<00:00:50.789> the<00:00:50.879> readings<00:00:51.329> are

00:00:54.250 --> 00:00:54.260 

00:00:54.260 --> 00:00:57.020 

that<00:00:55.260> was<00:00:55.379> a<00:00:55.440> good<00:00:55.590> one<00:00:55.710> felt<00:00:56.250> really<00:00:56.489> solid

00:00:57.020 --> 00:00:57.030 
that was a good one felt really solid

00:00:57.030 --> 00:00:58.880 
that was a good one felt really solid
felt<00:00:57.239> faster<00:00:57.690> so<00:00:57.809> it<00:00:57.930> felt<00:00:58.140> like<00:00:58.320> you<00:00:58.440> you

00:00:58.880 --> 00:00:58.890 
felt faster so it felt like you you

00:00:58.890 --> 00:01:00.889 
felt faster so it felt like you you
really<00:00:59.070> getting<00:00:59.219> some<00:00:59.399> peak<00:00:59.760> power<00:01:00.059> on<00:01:00.329> the<00:01:00.510> on

00:01:00.889 --> 00:01:00.899 
really getting some peak power on the on

00:01:00.899 --> 00:01:02.150 
really getting some peak power on the on
the<00:01:01.020> boss<00:01:01.230> have<00:01:01.559> another<00:01:01.770> girl

the<00:01:04.110> tour<00:01:04.350> head<00:01:04.619> it<00:01:05.100> should<00:01:05.129> be<00:01:05.369> quite<00:01:05.549> easy<00:01:05.580> to

00:01:06.020 --> 00:01:06.030 
the tour head it should be quite easy to

00:01:06.030 --> 00:01:08.149 
the tour head it should be quite easy to
maneuver<00:01:06.600> at<00:01:06.990> the<00:01:07.170> ball<00:01:07.350> right<00:01:07.590> to<00:01:07.650> left<00:01:07.830> and

00:01:09.260 --> 00:01:09.270 
left the right so I'm just going to see

00:01:09.270 --> 00:01:11.030 
left the right so I'm just going to see
how<00:01:09.330> easy<00:01:09.390> it<00:01:09.689> is<00:01:09.840> just<00:01:09.869> to<00:01:10.170> draw<00:01:10.500> it<00:01:10.710> and<00:01:10.830> just

00:01:11.030 --> 00:01:11.040 
how easy it is just to draw it and just

00:01:11.040 --> 00:01:13.219 
how easy it is just to draw it and just
how<00:01:11.189> to<00:01:11.220> feed<00:01:11.610> it<00:01:11.850> let's<00:01:12.330> try<00:01:12.479> this<00:01:12.600> first<00:01:12.930> one

00:01:13.219 --> 00:01:13.229 
how to feed it let's try this first one

00:01:13.229 --> 00:01:14.270 
how to feed it let's try this first one
let's<00:01:13.380> just<00:01:13.560> try<00:01:13.740> and<00:01:13.799> work<00:01:13.920> this<00:01:13.979> one<00:01:14.250> a

00:01:14.270 --> 00:01:14.280 
let's just try and work this one a

00:01:14.280 --> 00:01:19.370 
let's just try and work this one a
little<00:01:14.430> bit<00:01:14.700> right<00:01:14.909> to<00:01:15.119> left<00:01:17.780> that<00:01:18.780> was<00:01:18.900> easy

00:01:19.370 --> 00:01:19.380 
little bit right to left that was easy

00:01:19.380 --> 00:01:21.109 
little bit right to left that was easy
struck<00:01:19.710> it<00:01:19.830> slightly<00:01:20.340> off<00:01:20.460> the<00:01:20.610> bottom<00:01:20.970> as

00:01:21.109 --> 00:01:21.119 
struck it slightly off the bottom as

00:01:21.119 --> 00:01:23.480 
struck it slightly off the bottom as
well<00:01:21.270> to<00:01:22.080> be<00:01:22.200> fair<00:01:22.380> but<00:01:22.560> it<00:01:22.680> was<00:01:22.799> quite<00:01:23.130> easy<00:01:23.159> a

00:01:23.480 --> 00:01:23.490 
well to be fair but it was quite easy a

00:01:23.490 --> 00:01:24.890 
well to be fair but it was quite easy a
bit<00:01:23.640> will<00:01:23.759> tell<00:01:23.939> by<00:01:24.119> the<00:01:24.180> readings<00:01:24.630> it<00:01:24.750> was

00:01:24.890 --> 00:01:24.900 
bit will tell by the readings it was

00:01:24.900 --> 00:01:26.870 
bit will tell by the readings it was
working<00:01:25.619> over<00:01:25.890> quite<00:01:26.130> with<00:01:26.310> a<00:01:26.340> nice<00:01:26.549> shape

00:01:26.870 --> 00:01:26.880 
working over quite with a nice shape

fast<00:01:29.640> off<00:01:29.909> the<00:01:30.450> club<00:01:30.810> face<00:01:31.110> but<00:01:31.920> it<00:01:32.040> doesn't

00:01:32.600 --> 00:01:32.610 
fast off the club face but it doesn't

00:01:32.610 --> 00:01:33.920 
fast off the club face but it doesn't
it's<00:01:32.729> not<00:01:32.850> blowing<00:01:33.060> up<00:01:33.420> in<00:01:33.570> the<00:01:33.689> air<00:01:33.780> the

00:01:33.920 --> 00:01:33.930 
it's not blowing up in the air the

00:01:33.930 --> 00:01:35.510 
it's not blowing up in the air the
finish<00:01:34.350> it<00:01:34.530> the<00:01:34.650> shaft<00:01:34.890> feels<00:01:35.100> good<00:01:35.250> I'm<00:01:35.400> gonna

00:01:35.510 --> 00:01:35.520 
finish it the shaft feels good I'm gonna

00:01:35.520 --> 00:01:37.640 
finish it the shaft feels good I'm gonna
go<00:01:35.610> over<00:01:35.909> the<00:01:36.000> shafts<00:01:36.270> a<00:01:36.390> little<00:01:36.600> bit<00:01:36.720> more<00:01:36.930> in

00:01:37.640 --> 00:01:37.650 
go over the shafts a little bit more in

00:01:37.650 --> 00:01:39.380 
go over the shafts a little bit more in
a<00:01:38.009> second<00:01:38.340> let's<00:01:38.549> just<00:01:38.700> see<00:01:38.820> how<00:01:38.909> easy<00:01:39.150> it<00:01:39.299> is

00:01:39.380 --> 00:01:39.390 
a second let's just see how easy it is

00:01:39.390 --> 00:01:45.370 
a second let's just see how easy it is
just<00:01:39.420> a<00:01:39.750> feared<00:01:40.020> this<00:01:40.200> one<00:01:43.280> that<00:01:44.280> was<00:01:44.430> easy

00:01:45.370 --> 00:01:45.380 
just a feared this one that was easy

00:01:45.380 --> 00:01:47.600 
just a feared this one that was easy
probably<00:01:46.380> slightly<00:01:46.649> overdid<00:01:47.189> it<00:01:47.310> to<00:01:47.490> be

00:01:47.600 --> 00:01:47.610 
probably slightly overdid it to be

00:01:47.610 --> 00:01:51.080 
probably slightly overdid it to be
honest<00:01:49.009> maybe<00:01:50.009> they<00:01:50.189> need<00:01:50.369> to<00:01:50.399> put<00:01:50.640> as<00:01:50.759> much

00:01:51.080 --> 00:01:51.090 
honest maybe they need to put as much

00:01:51.090 --> 00:01:53.660 
honest maybe they need to put as much
effort<00:01:51.329> to<00:01:51.659> fit<00:01:52.409> it<00:01:52.649> to<00:01:52.680> be<00:01:52.920> fair<00:01:53.130> it<00:01:53.220> was<00:01:53.340> quite

00:01:53.660 --> 00:01:53.670 
effort to fit it to be fair it was quite

00:01:53.670 --> 00:01:55.940 
effort to fit it to be fair it was quite
simple<00:01:54.060> to<00:01:55.020> do<00:01:55.140> you'll<00:01:55.320> be<00:01:55.350> able<00:01:55.500> to<00:01:55.680> tell<00:01:55.799> by

00:01:55.940 --> 00:01:55.950 
simple to do you'll be able to tell by

00:01:55.950 --> 00:01:58.399 
simple to do you'll be able to tell by
the<00:01:56.009> readings<00:01:56.520> so<00:01:57.000> far<00:01:57.630> it<00:01:57.780> feels<00:01:57.810> good<00:01:58.259> the

00:01:58.399 --> 00:01:58.409 
the readings so far it feels good the

00:01:58.409 --> 00:02:01.010 
the readings so far it feels good the
shaft<00:01:58.680> feels<00:01:58.950> good<00:01:59.159> it<00:01:59.310> feels<00:01:59.340> quite<00:02:00.240> solid<00:02:00.719> in

00:02:01.010 --> 00:02:01.020 
shaft feels good it feels quite solid in

00:02:01.020 --> 00:02:02.840 
shaft feels good it feels quite solid in
there<00:02:01.170> in<00:02:01.290> the<00:02:01.380> tip<00:02:01.649> really<00:02:01.890> I'm<00:02:02.610> getting

00:02:02.840 --> 00:02:02.850 
there in the tip really I'm getting

00:02:02.850 --> 00:02:04.609 
there in the tip really I'm getting
pretty<00:02:03.149> much<00:02:03.270> a<00:02:03.299> mid<00:02:03.600> ball<00:02:03.840> flight<00:02:04.170> built<00:02:04.439> I'll

00:02:04.609 --> 00:02:04.619 
pretty much a mid ball flight built I'll

00:02:04.619 --> 00:02:06.620 
pretty much a mid ball flight built I'll
buy<00:02:04.770> the<00:02:04.829> reading<00:02:05.340> and<00:02:05.549> it's<00:02:06.000> not<00:02:06.180> spinning<00:02:06.420> up

00:02:06.620 --> 00:02:06.630 
buy the reading and it's not spinning up

00:02:06.630 --> 00:02:08.719 
buy the reading and it's not spinning up
in<00:02:06.750> there<00:02:06.960> so<00:02:07.170> that<00:02:07.200> the<00:02:07.439> shaft<00:02:07.680> seems<00:02:08.069> to<00:02:08.280> to

00:02:08.719 --> 00:02:08.729 
in there so that the shaft seems to to

00:02:08.729 --> 00:02:10.580 
in there so that the shaft seems to to
suit<00:02:09.000> the<00:02:09.209> head<00:02:09.390> and<00:02:09.629> what<00:02:10.050> quite<00:02:10.349> like<00:02:10.560> about

00:02:10.580 --> 00:02:10.590 
suit the head and what quite like about

00:02:10.590 --> 00:02:11.750 
suit the head and what quite like about
it<00:02:11.039> is<00:02:11.129> obviously<00:02:11.400> you've<00:02:11.550> got<00:02:11.640> the

it is obviously you've got the

00:02:11.760 --> 00:02:13.740 
it is obviously you've got the
adjustability<00:02:12.270> you've<00:02:12.599> got<00:02:12.690> the<00:02:12.810> Flex<00:02:13.110> lofts

00:02:13.740 --> 00:02:13.750 
adjustability you've got the Flex lofts

00:02:13.750 --> 00:02:15.480 
adjustability you've got the Flex lofts
you<00:02:14.140> know<00:02:14.200> that<00:02:14.560> you've<00:02:14.680> got<00:02:14.800> one<00:02:15.010> head<00:02:15.280> you

00:02:15.480 --> 00:02:15.490

available to being able to put that
adjustability<00:02:29.620> in<00:02:29.950> there<00:02:30.130> as<00:02:30.310> well<00:02:30.459> so<00:02:30.490> what

00:02:31.020 --> 00:02:31.030 
adjustability in there as well so what

00:02:31.030 --> 00:02:32.220 
adjustability in there as well so what
I'm<00:02:31.120> gonna<00:02:31.209> do<00:02:31.390> now<00:02:31.600> is<00:02:31.630> I'm<00:02:31.840> going<00:02:31.930> to<00:02:31.990> try<00:02:32.200> a

00:02:32.220 --> 00:02:32.230 
I'm gonna do now is I'm going to try a

00:02:32.230 --> 00:02:33.720 
I'm gonna do now is I'm going to try a
few<00:02:32.500> different<00:02:32.560> shafts<00:02:33.160> and<00:02:33.400> I'm<00:02:33.459> just<00:02:33.610> going

00:02:33.720 --> 00:02:33.730 
few different shafts and I'm just going

00:02:33.730 --> 00:02:35.160 
few different shafts and I'm just going
to<00:02:33.760> see<00:02:33.910> how<00:02:33.970> they<00:02:34.150> perform<00:02:34.360> so<00:02:35.050> I've<00:02:35.140> just

00:02:35.160 --> 00:02:35.170 
to see how they perform so I've just

00:02:35.170 --> 00:02:37.980 
to see how they perform so I've just
installed<00:02:35.770> the<00:02:35.920> matrix<00:02:36.490> black<00:02:36.880> tie<00:02:37.209> now<00:02:37.840> with

00:02:37.980 --> 00:02:37.990 
installed the matrix black tie now with

00:02:37.990 --> 00:02:40.020 
installed the matrix black tie now with
this<00:02:38.110> one<00:02:38.320> that<00:02:38.410> is<00:02:38.560> there<00:02:38.860> although<00:02:39.670> it's

00:02:40.020 --> 00:02:40.030 
this one that is there although it's

00:02:40.030 --> 00:02:42.240 
this one that is there although it's
launching<00:02:40.600> the<00:02:40.720> lowest<00:02:41.080> spin<00:02:41.500> shaft<00:02:41.980> so<00:02:42.160> I'm

00:02:42.240 --> 00:02:42.250 
launching the lowest spin shaft so I'm

00:02:42.250 --> 00:02:44.400 
launching the lowest spin shaft so I'm
expecting<00:02:42.790> it<00:02:42.910> to<00:02:43.090> come<00:02:43.330> out<00:02:43.600> much<00:02:43.870> lower<00:02:44.170> than

00:02:44.400 --> 00:02:44.410 
expecting it to come out much lower than

00:02:44.410 --> 00:02:47.130 
expecting it to come out much lower than
the<00:02:44.650> standard<00:02:45.550> kercadiou<00:02:46.420> shaft<00:02:46.690> so<00:02:46.930> let's

00:02:47.130 --> 00:02:47.140 
the standard kercadiou shaft so let's

00:02:47.140 --> 00:02:50.280 
the standard kercadiou shaft so let's
have<00:02:47.260> a<00:02:47.320> go<00:02:47.440> with<00:02:47.560> this<00:02:47.620> first<00:02:47.890> one<00:02:49.290> definitely

00:02:50.280 --> 00:02:50.290 
have a go with this first one definitely

00:02:50.290 --> 00:02:52.500 
have a go with this first one definitely
feels<00:02:50.590> quite<00:02:50.950> firm<00:02:51.340> as<00:02:51.580> well<00:02:51.670> let's<00:02:52.239> try<00:02:52.390> this

00:02:52.500 --> 00:02:52.510 
feels quite firm as well let's try this

00:02:52.510 --> 00:02:56.490 
feels quite firm as well let's try this
first<00:02:52.780> one<00:02:53.050> so<00:02:53.260> all<00:02:53.290> the<00:02:53.410> readings<00:02:53.739> are<00:02:55.500> I'll

00:02:56.490 --> 00:02:56.500 
first one so all the readings are I'll

00:02:56.500 --> 00:02:59.310 
first one so all the readings are I'll
rip<00:02:56.709> that<00:02:56.890> one<00:02:57.070> a<00:02:57.900> little<00:02:58.900> bit<00:02:59.080> of<00:02:59.170> movement

00:02:59.310 --> 00:02:59.320 
rip that one a little bit of movement

00:02:59.320 --> 00:03:01.140 
rip that one a little bit of movement
right<00:02:59.650> to<00:02:59.800> left<00:02:59.950> felt<00:03:00.250> like<00:03:00.340> a<00:03:00.370> poor<00:03:00.790> color

00:03:01.140 --> 00:03:01.150 
right to left felt like a poor color

00:03:01.150 --> 00:03:02.970 
right to left felt like a poor color
compared<00:03:01.600> to<00:03:01.720> the<00:03:01.840> courier<00:03:02.350> dish<00:03:02.590> after<00:03:02.770> it

00:03:02.970 --> 00:03:02.980 
compared to the courier dish after it

00:03:02.980 --> 00:03:04.800 
compared to the courier dish after it
felt<00:03:03.190> like<00:03:03.340> you<00:03:03.550> could<00:03:03.730> really<00:03:04.330> struggle<00:03:04.780> to

00:03:04.800 --> 00:03:04.810 
felt like you could really struggle to

00:03:04.810 --> 00:03:06.240 
felt like you could really struggle to
get<00:03:05.050> the<00:03:05.140> ball<00:03:05.350> up<00:03:05.380> in<00:03:05.680> the<00:03:05.739> air<00:03:05.860> you'll<00:03:06.160> be

00:03:06.240 --> 00:03:06.250 
get the ball up in the air you'll be

00:03:06.250 --> 00:03:07.470 
get the ball up in the air you'll be
able<00:03:06.310> to<00:03:06.459> tell<00:03:06.550> by<00:03:06.700> my<00:03:06.760> readings<00:03:07.120> it<00:03:07.239> has

00:03:07.470 --> 00:03:07.480 
able to tell by my readings it has

00:03:07.480 --> 00:03:09.479 
able to tell by my readings it has
actually<00:03:07.870> flawed<00:03:08.170> quite<00:03:08.470> low<00:03:08.709> there<00:03:09.220> wasn't

00:03:09.479 --> 00:03:09.489 
actually flawed quite low there wasn't

00:03:09.489 --> 00:03:12.210 
actually flawed quite low there wasn't
spinning<00:03:09.970> on<00:03:10.120> it<00:03:10.270> as<00:03:11.110> well<00:03:11.320> so<00:03:11.650> if<00:03:11.830> you<00:03:11.950> if<00:03:12.130> you

00:03:12.210 --> 00:03:12.220 
spinning on it as well so if you if you

00:03:12.220 --> 00:03:14.310 
spinning on it as well so if you if you
do<00:03:12.370> struggle<00:03:12.880> keeping<00:03:13.510> the<00:03:13.720> ball<00:03:13.900> low<00:03:13.930> then

00:03:14.310 --> 00:03:14.320 
do struggle keeping the ball low then

00:03:14.320 --> 00:03:15.390 
do struggle keeping the ball low then
you<00:03:14.350> definitely<00:03:14.530> won<00:03:14.830> over<00:03:14.980> try<00:03:15.160> with<00:03:15.310> the

00:03:15.390 --> 00:03:15.400 
you definitely won over try with the

00:03:15.400 --> 00:03:16.800 
you definitely won over try with the
black<00:03:15.610> side<00:03:15.850> now<00:03:16.330> I'm<00:03:16.420> going<00:03:16.540> to<00:03:16.600> try<00:03:16.750> the

00:03:16.800 --> 00:03:16.810 
black side now I'm going to try the

00:03:16.810 --> 00:03:18.840 
black side now I'm going to try the
future<00:03:17.260> career<00:03:17.470> fuel<00:03:17.799> shaft<00:03:18.130> so<00:03:18.730> I've<00:03:18.820> just

00:03:18.840 --> 00:03:18.850 
future career fuel shaft so I've just

00:03:18.850 --> 00:03:20.520 
future career fuel shaft so I've just
installed<00:03:19.239> the<00:03:19.570> future<00:03:19.959> career<00:03:20.230> of<00:03:20.290> fuel

00:03:20.520 --> 00:03:20.530 
installed the future career of fuel

00:03:20.530 --> 00:03:22.530 
installed the future career of fuel
shaft<00:03:20.890> now<00:03:21.310> this<00:03:21.519> one<00:03:21.700> I'm<00:03:21.790> expecting<00:03:22.299> it<00:03:22.390> to

00:03:22.530 --> 00:03:22.540 
shaft now this one I'm expecting it to

00:03:22.540 --> 00:03:24.330 
shaft now this one I'm expecting it to
vom<00:03:22.810> very<00:03:23.080> much<00:03:23.230> like<00:03:23.440> The<00:03:23.560> Courier<00:03:24.070> just

00:03:24.330 --> 00:03:24.340 
vom very much like The Courier just

00:03:24.340 --> 00:03:26.370 
vom very much like The Courier just
after<00:03:24.610> the<00:03:24.700> the<00:03:25.120> standard<00:03:25.540> shaft<00:03:25.810> maybe<00:03:26.110> is

00:03:26.370 --> 00:03:26.380 
after the the standard shaft maybe is

00:03:26.380 --> 00:03:29.490 
after the the standard shaft maybe is
slightly<00:03:27.280> lower<00:03:27.700> in<00:03:28.360> the<00:03:28.750> launch<00:03:29.019> but<00:03:29.380> it

00:03:29.490 --> 00:03:29.500 
slightly lower in the launch but it

00:03:29.500 --> 00:03:31.110 
slightly lower in the launch but it
should<00:03:29.890> be<00:03:29.980> very<00:03:30.190> much<00:03:30.400> the<00:03:30.549> same<00:03:30.730> so<00:03:30.940> let's

00:03:31.110 --> 00:03:31.120 
should be very much the same so let's

00:03:31.120 --> 00:03:35.900 
should be very much the same so let's
just<00:03:31.299> see<00:03:31.420> how<00:03:31.480> it<00:03:31.630> feels

00:03:35.900 --> 00:03:35.910 

00:03:35.910 --> 00:03:38.759 

that<00:03:36.910> felt<00:03:37.150> good<00:03:37.330> pretty<00:03:38.200> much<00:03:38.380> straight<00:03:38.650> down

00:03:38.759 --> 00:03:38.769 
that felt good pretty much straight down

00:03:38.769 --> 00:03:41.640 
that felt good pretty much straight down
the<00:03:39.040> target<00:03:39.280> line<00:03:39.519> it<00:03:40.049> launched<00:03:41.049> its<00:03:41.380> into

00:03:41.640 --> 00:03:41.650 
the target line it launched its into

00:03:41.650 --> 00:03:42.990 
the target line it launched its into
launch<00:03:41.830> maybe<00:03:42.100> just<00:03:42.280> a<00:03:42.370> little<00:03:42.400> bit<00:03:42.820> lower

00:03:42.990 --> 00:03:43.000 
launch maybe just a little bit lower

00:03:43.000 --> 00:03:44.520 
launch maybe just a little bit lower
than<00:03:43.209> the<00:03:43.299> standard<00:03:43.510> shaft<00:03:43.900> but<00:03:44.049> it<00:03:44.140> felt<00:03:44.380> more

00:03:44.520 --> 00:03:44.530 
than the standard shaft but it felt more

00:03:44.530 --> 00:03:46.590 
than the standard shaft but it felt more
of<00:03:44.650> it<00:03:44.799> a<00:03:44.829> crack<00:03:45.310> when<00:03:45.519> you<00:03:45.640> hit<00:03:45.790> it<00:03:45.820> it

00:03:46.590 --> 00:03:46.600 
of it a crack when you hit it it

00:03:46.600 --> 00:03:48.539 
of it a crack when you hit it it
actually<00:03:47.049> felt<00:03:47.290> quite<00:03:47.530> nice<00:03:47.799> to<00:03:48.040> be<00:03:48.130> fair<00:03:48.340> so

00:03:48.539 --> 00:03:48.549 
actually felt quite nice to be fair so

00:03:48.549 --> 00:03:49.979 
actually felt quite nice to be fair so
now<00:03:48.940> what<00:03:49.120> I'm<00:03:49.209> going<00:03:49.360> to<00:03:49.390> try<00:03:49.540> and<00:03:49.690> do<00:03:49.780> is<00:03:49.900> I'm

00:03:49.979 --> 00:03:49.989 
now what I'm going to try and do is I'm

00:03:49.989 --> 00:03:51.350 
now what I'm going to try and do is I'm
going<00:03:50.110> to<00:03:50.170> try<00:03:50.380> and<00:03:50.470> have<00:03:50.560> a<00:03:50.590> girl<00:03:50.829> with<00:03:50.980> the

00:03:51.350 --> 00:03:51.360 
going to try and have a girl with the

00:03:51.360 --> 00:03:54.630 
going to try and have a girl with the
UST<00:03:52.360> VTS<00:03:52.989> shaft<00:03:53.350> and<00:03:53.590> see<00:03:53.950> how<00:03:54.010> that<00:03:54.070> performs

00:03:54.630 --> 00:03:54.640 
UST VTS shaft and see how that performs

00:03:54.640 --> 00:03:57.180 
UST VTS shaft and see how that performs
so<00:03:55.000> here<00:03:55.180> it<00:03:55.299> is<00:03:55.480> the<00:03:55.660> pro<00:03:55.870> force<00:03:56.170> VTS<00:03:56.769> shaft

00:03:57.180 --> 00:03:57.190 
so here it is the pro force VTS shaft

00:03:57.190 --> 00:03:59.340 
so here it is the pro force VTS shaft
now<00:03:57.670> this<00:03:57.850> one<00:03:57.970> I'm<00:03:58.090> expecting<00:03:58.540> it<00:03:58.660> to<00:03:58.780> be<00:03:58.810> the

00:03:59.340 --> 00:03:59.350 
now this one I'm expecting it to be the

00:03:59.350 --> 00:04:03.120 
now this one I'm expecting it to be the
softest<00:03:59.920> of<00:04:00.250> all<00:04:00.790> the<00:04:00.970> custom<00:04:01.930> shafts<00:04:02.230> it

00:04:03.120 --> 00:04:03.130 
softest of all the custom shafts it

00:04:03.130 --> 00:04:05.009 
softest of all the custom shafts it
maybe<00:04:03.940> just<00:04:04.030> launched<00:04:04.420> and<00:04:04.630> it<00:04:04.720> still<00:04:04.870> may<00:04:04.989> be

00:04:05.009 --> 00:04:05.019 
maybe just launched and it still may be

00:04:05.019 --> 00:04:08.640 
maybe just launched and it still may be
a<00:04:05.140> mid<00:04:05.470> launch<00:04:06.459> and<00:04:07.030> a<00:04:07.299> mid<00:04:07.570> spin<00:04:08.079> so<00:04:08.350> anyway

00:04:08.640 --> 00:04:08.650 
a mid launch and a mid spin so anyway

00:04:08.650 --> 00:04:14.240 
a mid launch and a mid spin so anyway
let's<00:04:08.860> see<00:04:08.980> how<00:04:09.040> it<00:04:09.190> feels

00:04:14.240 --> 00:04:14.250 

00:04:14.250 --> 00:04:16.740 

that<00:04:15.250> was<00:04:15.370> good<00:04:15.550> felt<00:04:15.850> soft<00:04:16.239> pretty<00:04:16.600> much

00:04:16.740 --> 00:04:16.750 
that was good felt soft pretty much

00:04:16.750 --> 00:04:18.150 
that was good felt soft pretty much
straight<00:04:17.020> down<00:04:17.050> the<00:04:17.290> target<00:04:17.530> line<00:04:17.739> though

00:04:18.150 --> 00:04:18.160 
straight down the target line though

00:04:18.160 --> 00:04:20.430 
straight down the target line though
definitely<00:04:18.850> felt<00:04:19.270> softest<00:04:19.750> of<00:04:19.930> all<00:04:20.290> the

00:04:20.430 --> 00:04:20.440 
definitely felt softest of all the

00:04:20.440 --> 00:04:22.350 
definitely felt softest of all the
chef's<00:04:20.650> maybe<00:04:20.950> felt<00:04:21.160> a<00:04:21.190> bit<00:04:21.310> more<00:04:21.489> active<00:04:21.820> in

00:04:22.350 --> 00:04:22.360 
chef's maybe felt a bit more active in

00:04:22.360 --> 00:04:24.120 
chef's maybe felt a bit more active in
the<00:04:22.540> tip<00:04:22.810> so<00:04:23.290> I<00:04:23.350> felt<00:04:23.530> like<00:04:23.590> now<00:04:23.800> you've<00:04:23.980> done<00:04:24.070> a

00:04:24.120 --> 00:04:24.130 
the tip so I felt like now you've done a

00:04:24.130 --> 00:04:25.800 
the tip so I felt like now you've done a
really<00:04:24.370> good<00:04:24.610> job<00:04:24.670> with<00:04:24.970> the<00:04:25.060> covert<00:04:25.420> tour

00:04:25.800 --> 00:04:25.810 
really good job with the covert tour

00:04:25.810 --> 00:04:28.050 
really good job with the covert tour
driver<00:04:26.110> because<00:04:26.440> they've<00:04:26.830> been<00:04:26.980> able<00:04:27.160> to<00:04:27.280> have

00:04:28.050 --> 00:04:28.060 
driver because they've been able to have

00:04:28.060 --> 00:04:30.030 
driver because they've been able to have
all<00:04:28.180> this<00:04:28.330> performance<00:04:29.080> being<00:04:29.410> it<00:04:29.590> for<00:04:29.830> me<00:04:29.950> it

00:04:30.030 --> 00:04:30.040 
all this performance being it for me it

00:04:30.040 --> 00:04:32.130 
all this performance being it for me it
was<00:04:30.130> quite<00:04:30.310> easy<00:04:30.550> to<00:04:30.910> maneuver<00:04:31.630> left<00:04:31.840> there

00:04:32.130 --> 00:04:32.140 
was quite easy to maneuver left there

00:04:32.140 --> 00:04:33.180 
was quite easy to maneuver left there
right<00:04:32.410> right<00:04:32.440> to<00:04:32.860> left

00:04:33.180 --> 00:04:33.190 
right right to left

00:04:33.190 --> 00:04:35.010 
right right to left
maybe<00:04:33.640> overdid<00:04:34.150> it<00:04:34.240> actually<00:04:34.570> when<00:04:34.690> I<00:04:34.780> tried

00:04:35.010 --> 00:04:35.020 
maybe overdid it actually when I tried

00:04:35.020 --> 00:04:37.380 
maybe overdid it actually when I tried
to<00:04:35.200> feel<00:04:35.860> it<00:04:36.100> and<00:04:36.280> and<00:04:36.790> that<00:04:36.940> you<00:04:37.270> normally

00:04:37.380 --> 00:04:37.390 
to feel it and and that you normally

00:04:37.390 --> 00:04:39.390 
to feel it and and that you normally
find<00:04:37.750> it's<00:04:37.960> quite<00:04:37.990> hard<00:04:38.470> nowadays<00:04:38.740> to

00:04:39.390 --> 00:04:39.400 
find it's quite hard nowadays to

00:04:39.400 --> 00:04:41.310 
find it's quite hard nowadays to
actually<00:04:39.700> hit<00:04:39.970> the<00:04:40.150> ball<00:04:40.360> with<00:04:40.540> there<00:04:40.900> with

00:04:41.310 --> 00:04:41.320 
actually hit the ball with there with

00:04:41.320 --> 00:04:43.110 
actually hit the ball with there with
 because<00:04:42.070> it's<00:04:42.310> all<00:04:42.460> designed<00:04:42.850> to<00:04:42.940> try

00:04:43.110 --> 00:04:43.120 
 because it's all designed to try

00:04:43.120 --> 00:04:44.670 
 because it's all designed to try
and<00:04:43.240> hit<00:04:43.330> the<00:04:43.450> ball<00:04:43.630> as<00:04:43.840> straight<00:04:44.530> as<00:04:44.590> possible

00:04:44.670 --> 00:04:44.680 
and hit the ball as straight as possible
