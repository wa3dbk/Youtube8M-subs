00:00:49.819 --> 00:00:49.829 
since getting the braces on and so I

00:00:49.829 --> 00:00:51.770 
since getting the braces on and so I
hadn't<00:00:50.190> seen<00:00:50.309> them<00:00:50.430> in<00:00:50.610> like<00:00:50.640> two<00:00:50.789> months<00:00:51.090> and

00:00:51.770 --> 00:00:51.780 
hadn't seen them in like two months and

00:00:51.780 --> 00:00:54.950 
hadn't seen them in like two months and
then<00:00:52.620> I<00:00:53.160> have<00:00:53.550> another<00:00:53.820> appointment<00:00:54.360> with

00:00:57.950 --> 00:00:57.960 
them in the end of March and I think

00:00:57.960 --> 00:01:00.049 
them in the end of March and I think
that's<00:00:58.289> when<00:00:58.710> they're<00:00:58.890> gonna<00:00:59.010> put<00:00:59.430> on<00:00:59.640> the

00:01:00.049 --> 00:01:00.059 
that's when they're gonna put on the

00:01:00.059 --> 00:01:03.110 
that's when they're gonna put on the
steel<00:01:00.960> wires<00:01:01.289> but<00:01:01.829> now<00:01:02.430> if<00:01:02.550> I<00:01:02.609> think<00:01:02.820> about<00:01:03.000> it

00:01:03.110 --> 00:01:03.120 
steel wires but now if I think about it

00:01:03.120 --> 00:01:04.399 
steel wires but now if I think about it
that's<00:01:03.239> really<00:01:03.539> early<00:01:03.570> because<00:01:04.019> I'm<00:01:04.260> not

00:01:04.399 --> 00:01:04.409 
that's really early because I'm not

00:01:04.409 --> 00:01:08.240 
that's really early because I'm not
having<00:01:04.739> my<00:01:04.860> surgery<00:01:05.309> until<00:01:05.729> June<00:01:06.470> but<00:01:07.470> oh<00:01:07.710> well

00:01:08.240 --> 00:01:08.250 
having my surgery until June but oh well

00:01:08.250 --> 00:01:10.250 
having my surgery until June but oh well
they<00:01:09.030> know<00:01:09.180> what<00:01:09.330> they're<00:01:09.450> doing<00:01:09.479> I<00:01:09.840> guess<00:01:10.020> I

00:01:10.250 --> 00:01:10.260 
they know what they're doing I guess I

00:01:10.260 --> 00:01:15.200 
they know what they're doing I guess I
hope<00:01:10.470> hopefully<00:01:11.100> um<00:01:11.549> and<00:01:12.210> then<00:01:13.200> I<00:01:13.939> when<00:01:14.939> I<00:01:14.970> went

00:01:15.200 --> 00:01:15.210 
hope hopefully um and then I when I went

00:01:15.210 --> 00:01:18.800 
hope hopefully um and then I when I went
in<00:01:15.330> last<00:01:15.479> time<00:01:15.750> they<00:01:16.500> took<00:01:17.159> molds<00:01:17.670> of<00:01:18.150> my<00:01:18.540> jaws

00:01:18.800 --> 00:01:18.810 
in last time they took molds of my jaws

00:01:18.810 --> 00:01:20.810 
in last time they took molds of my jaws
again<00:01:19.350> and<00:01:19.710> took<00:01:20.070> a<00:01:20.130> whole<00:01:20.340> bunch<00:01:20.520> of<00:01:20.610> pictures

00:01:20.810 --> 00:01:20.820

00:01:20.820 --> 00:01:23.960 
again and took a whole bunch of pictures
to<00:01:21.000> send<00:01:21.360> to<00:01:21.509> the<00:01:21.630> surgeon<00:01:22.020> because<00:01:22.409> i<00:01:23.070> guess

00:01:23.960 --> 00:01:23.970 
to send to the surgeon because i guess

00:01:23.970 --> 00:01:26.270 
to send to the surgeon because i guess
like<00:01:24.299> the<00:01:24.810> surgeon<00:01:25.350> is<00:01:25.470> super<00:01:25.770> busy<00:01:25.890> in<00:01:26.159> the

00:01:26.270 --> 00:01:26.280 
like the surgeon is super busy in the

like the surgeon is super busy in the
summer<00:01:26.460> and<00:01:26.610> so<00:01:26.880> they<00:01:27.030> wanted<00:01:27.330> to<00:01:27.390> send<00:01:27.720> off

00:01:28.240 --> 00:01:28.250

00:02:55.309 --> 00:02:55.319 
because my teeth and everything we're

00:02:55.319 --> 00:02:56.959 
because my teeth and everything we're
already<00:02:55.680> pretty<00:02:55.949> aligned<00:02:56.370> because<00:02:56.819> I'd<00:02:56.939> been

00:02:56.959 --> 00:02:56.969 
already pretty aligned because I'd been

00:02:56.969 --> 00:02:59.750 
already pretty aligned because I'd been
in<00:02:57.150> braces<00:02:57.480> for<00:02:57.930> a<00:02:57.989> while<00:02:58.199> before<00:02:58.469> and<00:02:58.949> so<00:02:59.730> now

00:02:59.750 --> 00:02:59.760 
in braces for a while before and so now

00:02:59.760 --> 00:03:01.789 
in braces for a while before and so now
it's<00:03:00.329> basically<00:03:00.659> just<00:03:00.750> school<00:03:01.230> that's<00:03:01.530> in<00:03:01.650> the

00:03:01.789 --> 00:03:01.799 
it's basically just school that's in the

00:03:01.799 --> 00:03:05.240 
it's basically just school that's in the
way<00:03:01.919> so<00:03:02.930> hopefully<00:03:03.930> it<00:03:04.469> all<00:03:04.650> goes<00:03:04.980> according

00:03:05.240 --> 00:03:05.250 
way so hopefully it all goes according

00:03:05.250 --> 00:03:08.720 
way so hopefully it all goes according
to<00:03:05.730> plan<00:03:05.939> and<00:03:06.590> nothing<00:03:07.590> else<00:03:07.709> happens<00:03:08.159> and

00:03:08.720 --> 00:03:08.730 
to plan and nothing else happens and

00:03:08.730 --> 00:03:11.089 
to plan and nothing else happens and
this<00:03:09.629> can<00:03:09.810> actually<00:03:09.930> just<00:03:10.230> all<00:03:10.409> carry<00:03:10.709> out<00:03:10.919> how

00:03:11.089 --> 00:03:11.099
