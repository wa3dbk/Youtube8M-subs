00:00:25.460 --> 00:00:25.470 
because it was released about two years

00:00:25.470 --> 00:00:28.160 
because it was released about two years
ago<00:00:25.910> you<00:00:26.910> know<00:00:27.000> when<00:00:27.390> you<00:00:27.449> got<00:00:27.570> a<00:00:27.630> new<00:00:27.779> product

ago you know when you got a new product

00:00:28.170 --> 00:00:29.179 
ago you know when you got a new product
you're<00:00:28.289> gonna<00:00:28.349> be<00:00:28.560> going<00:00:28.769> through<00:00:28.830> the<00:00:29.039> art

process
alright<00:00:30.300> so<00:00:30.570> they've<00:00:31.019> had<00:00:31.230> engineering<00:00:31.740> on

00:00:31.999 --> 00:00:32.009 
alright so they've had engineering on

00:00:32.009 --> 00:00:33.380 
alright so they've had engineering on
the<00:00:32.250> engine<00:00:32.550> the<00:00:32.669> whole<00:00:32.820> time<00:00:33.030> they<00:00:33.239> haven't

00:00:33.380 --> 00:00:33.390 
the engine the whole time they haven't

00:00:33.390 --> 00:00:36.040 
the engine the whole time they haven't
moved<00:00:33.600> on<00:00:33.780> to<00:00:33.930> other<00:00:34.050> projects<00:00:34.530> and<00:00:34.800> so<00:00:35.640> as

00:00:36.040 --> 00:00:36.050 
moved on to other projects and so as

00:00:36.050 --> 00:00:37.910 
moved on to other projects and so as
information<00:00:37.050> comes<00:00:37.079> back<00:00:37.469> from<00:00:37.680> the<00:00:37.770> field

00:00:37.910 --> 00:00:37.920 
information comes back from the field

00:00:37.920 --> 00:00:40.250 
information comes back from the field
they<00:00:38.520> learn<00:00:38.730> things<00:00:39.059> they've<00:00:39.629> decided<00:00:39.989> what

00:00:40.250 --> 00:00:40.260 
they learn things they've decided what

00:00:40.260 --> 00:00:41.750 
they learn things they've decided what
they<00:00:40.379> want<00:00:40.559> to<00:00:40.649> change<00:00:40.920> and<00:00:41.340> they<00:00:41.489> finally

00:00:41.750 --> 00:00:41.760 
they want to change and they finally

00:00:41.760 --> 00:00:44.240 
they want to change and they finally
culminated<00:00:42.570> all<00:00:42.750> of<00:00:42.989> it<00:00:43.110> into<00:00:43.350> one<00:00:43.590> spot<00:00:44.070> where

00:00:44.240 --> 00:00:44.250 
culminated all of it into one spot where

00:00:44.250 --> 00:00:46.220 
culminated all of it into one spot where
they<00:00:44.550> want<00:00:44.730> to<00:00:44.820> make<00:00:44.940> a<00:00:44.969> software<00:00:45.510> update<00:00:45.960> to

00:00:46.220 --> 00:00:46.230 
they want to make a software update to

00:00:46.230 --> 00:00:49.430 
they want to make a software update to
the<00:00:46.649> ECU<00:00:46.980> the<00:00:47.309> engine<00:00:47.730> control<00:00:47.910> unit<00:00:48.390> and<00:00:48.510> it's

00:00:49.430 --> 00:00:49.440 
the ECU the engine control unit and it's

00:00:49.440 --> 00:00:51.410 
the ECU the engine control unit and it's
released<00:00:49.829> now<00:00:50.129> I<00:00:50.340> mean<00:00:50.579> just<00:00:50.789> yesterday<00:00:51.180> we

00:00:51.410 --> 00:00:51.420 
released now I mean just yesterday we

00:00:51.420 --> 00:00:52.700 
released now I mean just yesterday we
started<00:00:51.480> flashing<00:00:51.960> a<00:00:52.199> lot<00:00:52.350> of<00:00:52.469> the<00:00:52.530> new

00:00:52.700 --> 00:00:52.710 
started flashing a lot of the new

00:00:52.710 --> 00:00:55.400 
started flashing a lot of the new
aircraft<00:00:53.309> that<00:00:53.789> have<00:00:53.940> this<00:00:54.180> engine<00:00:54.600> what<00:00:55.320> are

00:00:55.400 --> 00:00:55.410 
aircraft that have this engine what are

00:00:55.410 --> 00:00:57.920 
aircraft that have this engine what are
they<00:00:55.500> changing<00:00:55.770> a<00:00:56.300> variety<00:00:57.300> of<00:00:57.329> things<00:00:57.629> in<00:00:57.870> the

00:00:57.920 --> 00:00:57.930 
they changing a variety of things in the

00:00:57.930 --> 00:01:00.020 
they changing a variety of things in the
software<00:00:58.469> some<00:00:59.129> of<00:00:59.190> the<00:00:59.280> things<00:00:59.460> had<00:00:59.670> to<00:00:59.850> do

00:01:00.020 --> 00:01:00.030 
software some of the things had to do

00:01:00.030 --> 00:01:01.760 
software some of the things had to do
with<00:01:00.300> for<00:01:00.510> instance<00:01:00.539> and<00:01:01.320> when<00:01:01.469> it<00:01:01.590> does<00:01:01.739> a

00:01:01.760 --> 00:01:01.770 
with for instance and when it does a

00:01:01.770 --> 00:01:03.590 
with for instance and when it does a
date<00:01:02.039> of<00:01:02.190> fall<00:01:02.399> there's<00:01:02.850> something

00:01:03.590 --> 00:01:03.600 
date of fall there's something

00:01:03.600 --> 00:01:05.390 
date of fall there's something
information<00:01:04.290> coming<00:01:04.500> in<00:01:04.680> from<00:01:04.830> a<00:01:04.920> sensor<00:01:05.280> or

00:01:05.390 --> 00:01:05.400 
information coming in from a sensor or

00:01:05.400 --> 00:01:07.910 
information coming in from a sensor or
whatever<00:01:05.760> some<00:01:06.450> of<00:01:06.540> those<00:01:06.600> data<00:01:06.900> faults<00:01:07.439> would

00:01:07.910 --> 00:01:07.920 
whatever some of those data faults would

00:01:07.920 --> 00:01:10.070 
whatever some of those data faults would
happen<00:01:08.280> just<00:01:08.580> because<00:01:09.000> okay<00:01:09.450> the<00:01:09.630> voltage

00:01:10.070 --> 00:01:10.080 
happen just because okay the voltage

00:01:10.080 --> 00:01:12.859 
happen just because okay the voltage
that<00:01:10.470> it's<00:01:10.619> generating<00:01:11.310> on<00:01:11.460> startup<00:01:12.060> during

00:01:12.859 --> 00:01:12.869 
that it's generating on startup during

00:01:12.869 --> 00:01:15.380 
that it's generating on startup during
the<00:01:12.960> startup<00:01:13.320> process<00:01:13.799> isn't<00:01:14.100> as<00:01:14.400> high<00:01:14.610> as<00:01:14.909> the

00:01:15.380 --> 00:01:15.390 
the startup process isn't as high as the

00:01:15.390 --> 00:01:17.300 
the startup process isn't as high as the
computer<00:01:15.780> is<00:01:15.810> looking<00:01:16.110> for<00:01:16.320> so<00:01:16.740> it<00:01:16.860> Flags<00:01:17.100> out

00:01:17.300 --> 00:01:17.310 
computer is looking for so it Flags out

00:01:17.310 --> 00:01:18.950 
computer is looking for so it Flags out
on<00:01:17.430> a<00:01:17.460> fault<00:01:17.759> well<00:01:18.030> we<00:01:18.390> don't<00:01:18.540> want<00:01:18.720> that<00:01:18.750> in

00:01:18.950 --> 00:01:18.960 
on a fault well we don't want that in

00:01:18.960 --> 00:01:20.450 
on a fault well we don't want that in
there<00:01:19.110> so<00:01:19.259> they're<00:01:19.439> figuring<00:01:19.860> out<00:01:19.979> timing

00:01:20.450 --> 00:01:20.460 
there so they're figuring out timing

00:01:20.460 --> 00:01:21.859 
there so they're figuring out timing
things<00:01:20.700> to<00:01:20.880> say<00:01:21.030> okay<00:01:21.299> we're<00:01:21.450> not<00:01:21.479> even<00:01:21.720> going

00:01:21.859 --> 00:01:21.869 
things to say okay we're not even going

00:01:21.869 --> 00:01:23.450 
things to say okay we're not even going
to<00:01:21.900> look<00:01:22.049> at<00:01:22.200> that<00:01:22.350> until<00:01:22.770> after<00:01:23.070> this<00:01:23.159> point

00:01:23.450 --> 00:01:23.460 
to look at that until after this point

00:01:23.460 --> 00:01:25.460 
to look at that until after this point
in<00:01:23.549> time<00:01:23.729> so<00:01:24.270> we<00:01:24.360> don't<00:01:24.540> get<00:01:24.659> the<00:01:24.720> data<00:01:24.990> fault

00:01:25.460 --> 00:01:25.470 
in time so we don't get the data fault

00:01:25.470 --> 00:01:27.499 
in time so we don't get the data fault
another<00:01:26.040> thing<00:01:26.250> that<00:01:26.369> happens<00:01:26.700> the<00:01:26.909> engine<00:01:27.299> is

00:01:27.499 --> 00:01:27.509 
another thing that happens the engine is

00:01:27.509 --> 00:01:29.990 
another thing that happens the engine is
designed<00:01:28.259> to<00:01:28.380> be<00:01:28.500> very<00:01:28.740> clean<00:01:29.159> very<00:01:29.490> efficient

00:01:29.990 --> 00:01:30.000 
designed to be very clean very efficient

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:32.270 
designed to be very clean very efficient
so<00:01:30.509> when<00:01:31.020> the<00:01:31.140> engine<00:01:31.470> is<00:01:31.530> sitting<00:01:31.829> at<00:01:31.950> idle

00:01:32.270 --> 00:01:32.280 
so when the engine is sitting at idle

00:01:32.280 --> 00:01:34.520 
so when the engine is sitting at idle
it's<00:01:33.119> running<00:01:33.479> really<00:01:33.659> really<00:01:33.869> lean<00:01:34.200> I<00:01:34.380> mean

00:01:34.520 --> 00:01:34.530 
it's running really really lean I mean

00:01:34.530 --> 00:01:36.440 
it's running really really lean I mean
if<00:01:34.619> you<00:01:34.680> look<00:01:34.860> at<00:01:34.979> the<00:01:35.130> exhaust<00:01:35.490> pipes<00:01:35.909> of<00:01:36.180> any

00:01:36.440 --> 00:01:36.450 
if you look at the exhaust pipes of any

00:01:36.450 --> 00:01:38.450 
if you look at the exhaust pipes of any
of<00:01:36.600> the<00:01:36.659> engines<00:01:37.049> out<00:01:37.290> here<00:01:37.590> you'll<00:01:38.070> find<00:01:38.280> that

00:01:38.450 --> 00:01:38.460 
of the engines out here you'll find that

00:01:38.460 --> 00:01:39.710 
of the engines out here you'll find that
they're<00:01:38.640> very<00:01:38.790> very<00:01:39.000> clean<00:01:39.299> maybe<00:01:39.509> a<00:01:39.570> little

00:01:39.710 --> 00:01:39.720 
they're very very clean maybe a little

00:01:39.720 --> 00:01:41.149 
they're very very clean maybe a little
bit<00:01:39.900> of<00:01:39.990> white<00:01:40.110> dust<00:01:40.409> and<00:01:40.619> that's<00:01:40.770> it

00:01:41.149 --> 00:01:41.159 
bit of white dust and that's it

00:01:41.159 --> 00:01:42.649 
bit of white dust and that's it
it's<00:01:41.549> because<00:01:41.970> the<00:01:42.090> engine<00:01:42.390> is<00:01:42.450> running

00:01:42.649 --> 00:01:42.659 
it's because the engine is running

00:01:42.659 --> 00:01:45.230 
it's because the engine is running
really<00:01:42.899> really<00:01:43.200> lean<00:01:43.820> especially<00:01:44.820> at<00:01:44.909> idle

00:01:45.230 --> 00:01:45.240 
really really lean especially at idle

00:01:45.240 --> 00:01:47.660 
really really lean especially at idle
but<00:01:45.840> what<00:01:45.990> that<00:01:46.140> does<00:01:46.380> now<00:01:46.710> is<00:01:46.979> that<00:01:47.549> when

00:01:47.660 --> 00:01:47.670 
but what that does now is that when

00:01:47.670 --> 00:01:48.950 
but what that does now is that when
you're<00:01:47.790> sitting<00:01:48.030> at<00:01:48.119> idle<00:01:48.390> and<00:01:48.630> on<00:01:48.720> some

00:01:48.950 --> 00:01:48.960 
you're sitting at idle and on some

00:01:48.960 --> 00:01:50.840 
you're sitting at idle and on some
airplanes<00:01:49.350> for<00:01:49.619> instance<00:01:49.920> pusher<00:01:50.280> aircraft

00:01:50.840 --> 00:01:50.850 
airplanes for instance pusher aircraft

00:01:50.850 --> 00:01:52.550 
airplanes for instance pusher aircraft
that<00:01:51.540> don't<00:01:51.869> have<00:01:52.020> a<00:01:52.049> lot<00:01:52.200> of<00:01:52.229> air<00:01:52.380> going

00:01:52.550 --> 00:01:52.560 
that don't have a lot of air going

00:01:52.560 --> 00:01:54.710 
that don't have a lot of air going
through<00:01:52.680> the<00:01:52.860> radiator<00:01:53.250> the<00:01:53.540> engine<00:01:54.540> gets

00:01:54.710 --> 00:01:54.720 
through the radiator the engine gets

00:01:54.720 --> 00:01:57.350 
through the radiator the engine gets
pretty<00:01:54.960> warm<00:01:55.200> pretty<00:01:55.470> quick<00:01:55.799> so<00:01:56.430> that's<00:01:57.060> been

00:01:57.350 --> 00:01:57.360 
pretty warm pretty quick so that's been

00:01:57.360 --> 00:01:58.429 
pretty warm pretty quick so that's been
a<00:01:57.390> little<00:01:57.719> bit<00:01:57.840> of<00:01:57.899> an<00:01:57.990> issue<00:01:58.170> for<00:01:58.259> some

00:01:58.429 --> 00:01:58.439 
a little bit of an issue for some

00:01:58.439 --> 00:02:00.469 
a little bit of an issue for some
airplanes<00:01:59.040> on<00:01:59.430> the<00:01:59.670> air<00:01:59.790> can<00:02:00.000> we<00:02:00.210> add<00:02:00.329> an

00:02:00.469 --> 00:02:00.479 
airplanes on the air can we add an

00:02:00.479 --> 00:02:02.149 
airplanes on the air can we add an
electric<00:02:00.899> fan<00:02:01.079> on<00:02:01.140> the<00:02:01.320> radiator<00:02:01.649> take<00:02:01.920> care

00:02:02.149 --> 00:02:02.159 
electric fan on the radiator take care

00:02:02.159 --> 00:02:04.490 
electric fan on the radiator take care
of<00:02:02.219> that<00:02:02.369> so<00:02:03.090> what<00:02:03.570> they're<00:02:03.719> going<00:02:03.810> to<00:02:03.869> do<00:02:04.140> is

00:02:04.490 --> 00:02:04.500 
of that so what they're going to do is

00:02:04.500 --> 00:02:06.830 
of that so what they're going to do is
in<00:02:04.860> this<00:02:05.100> software<00:02:05.579> update<00:02:06.030> they've<00:02:06.479> designed

00:02:06.830 --> 00:02:06.840 
in this software update they've designed

00:02:06.840 --> 00:02:08.419 
in this software update they've designed
it<00:02:07.020> so<00:02:07.259> that<00:02:07.290> when<00:02:07.710> the<00:02:07.950> coolant<00:02:08.310> temperature

00:02:08.419 --> 00:02:08.429 
it so that when the coolant temperature

00:02:08.429 --> 00:02:10.729 
it so that when the coolant temperature
comes<00:02:08.910> up<00:02:09.090> to<00:02:09.209> a<00:02:09.239> certain<00:02:09.450> level<00:02:09.929> they<00:02:10.440> start

00:02:10.729 --> 00:02:10.739 
comes up to a certain level they start

00:02:10.739 --> 00:02:12.890 
comes up to a certain level they start
rigging<00:02:11.280> the<00:02:11.400> mixture<00:02:11.760> at<00:02:11.879> idle<00:02:12.209> to<00:02:12.510> keep<00:02:12.690> the

00:02:12.890 --> 00:02:12.900 
rigging the mixture at idle to keep the

00:02:12.900 --> 00:02:15.050 
rigging the mixture at idle to keep the
from<00:02:13.349> warming<00:02:13.650> up<00:02:13.799> quite<00:02:14.040> so<00:02:14.250> much<00:02:14.430> there<00:02:14.939> are

00:02:15.050 --> 00:02:15.060 
from warming up quite so much there are

00:02:15.060 --> 00:02:16.550 
from warming up quite so much there are
other<00:02:15.239> changes<00:02:15.599> that<00:02:15.840> they've<00:02:16.170> made<00:02:16.349> in<00:02:16.409> the

00:02:16.550 --> 00:02:16.560 
other changes that they've made in the

00:02:16.560 --> 00:02:18.319 
other changes that they've made in the
software<00:02:16.980> but<00:02:17.099> you<00:02:17.489> know<00:02:17.579> those<00:02:18.000> are<00:02:18.180> a<00:02:18.239> couple

00:02:18.319 --> 00:02:18.329 
software but you know those are a couple

00:02:18.329 --> 00:02:20.059 
software but you know those are a couple
of<00:02:18.450> the<00:02:18.540> examples<00:02:18.659> that<00:02:19.319> people<00:02:19.769> would<00:02:19.950> really

00:02:20.059 --> 00:02:20.069 
of the examples that people would really

00:02:20.069 --> 00:02:22.160 
of the examples that people would really
relate<00:02:20.400> to<00:02:20.579> and<00:02:20.700> understand<00:02:21.090> quickly<00:02:21.480> what<00:02:22.079> is

00:02:22.160 --> 00:02:22.170 
relate to and understand quickly what is

00:02:22.170 --> 00:02:23.559 
relate to and understand quickly what is
involved<00:02:22.560> in<00:02:22.650> making<00:02:22.769> this<00:02:23.040> upgrade

00:02:23.559 --> 00:02:23.569 
involved in making this upgrade

00:02:23.569 --> 00:02:26.089 
involved in making this upgrade
basically<00:02:24.569> they<00:02:25.140> have<00:02:25.409> what's<00:02:25.769> called<00:02:25.829> the

00:02:26.089 --> 00:02:26.099 
basically they have what's called the

00:02:26.099 --> 00:02:27.319 
basically they have what's called the
buds<00:02:26.459> system

00:02:27.319 --> 00:02:27.329 
buds system

00:02:27.329 --> 00:02:29.960 
buds system
it's<00:02:27.599> the<00:02:27.870> BRP<00:02:28.530> utility<00:02:29.220> and<00:02:29.340> diagnostic

00:02:29.960 --> 00:02:29.970 
it's the BRP utility and diagnostic

00:02:29.970 --> 00:02:33.170 
it's the BRP utility and diagnostic
system<00:02:30.420> it's<00:02:30.720> a<00:02:31.220> software<00:02:32.220> program<00:02:32.819> that<00:02:32.849> you

00:02:33.170 --> 00:02:33.180 
system it's a software program that you

00:02:33.180 --> 00:02:35.000 
system it's a software program that you
can<00:02:33.209> download<00:02:33.629> from<00:02:34.049> the<00:02:34.200> factory<00:02:34.560> website

00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:35.010 
can download from the factory website

00:02:35.010 --> 00:02:38.149 
can download from the factory website
and<00:02:35.220> then<00:02:35.670> you<00:02:35.790> get<00:02:35.909> a<00:02:35.970> dongle<00:02:36.599> that<00:02:36.950> mates<00:02:37.950> up

00:02:38.149 --> 00:02:38.159 
and then you get a dongle that mates up

00:02:38.159 --> 00:02:39.710 
and then you get a dongle that mates up
to<00:02:38.340> your<00:02:38.459> computer<00:02:38.549> and<00:02:39.060> then<00:02:39.299> you<00:02:39.390> can<00:02:39.540> hook

00:02:39.710 --> 00:02:39.720 
to your computer and then you can hook

00:02:39.720 --> 00:02:42.920 
to your computer and then you can hook
up<00:02:39.900> to<00:02:39.930> a<00:02:40.079> data<00:02:40.349> port<00:02:40.650> on<00:02:40.829> the<00:02:41.280> ECU<00:02:41.819> and<00:02:42.090> you<00:02:42.780> can

00:02:42.920 --> 00:02:42.930 
up to a data port on the ECU and you can

00:02:42.930 --> 00:02:44.420 
up to a data port on the ECU and you can
look<00:02:43.079> at<00:02:43.200> all<00:02:43.290> the<00:02:43.409> parameters<00:02:43.560> we<00:02:44.040> even<00:02:44.220> do

00:02:44.420 --> 00:02:44.430 
look at all the parameters we even do

00:02:44.430 --> 00:02:46.250 
look at all the parameters we even do
