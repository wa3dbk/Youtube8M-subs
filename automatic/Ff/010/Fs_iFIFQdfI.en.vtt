00:02:33.930 --> 00:02:35.690 
kind of slowly floats along the controls
for<00:02:34.050> your<00:02:34.110> guns<00:02:34.350> on<00:02:34.530> the<00:02:34.709> right<00:02:35.069> side<00:02:35.400> which

00:02:35.690 --> 00:02:35.700 
for your guns on the right side which

00:02:35.700 --> 00:02:37.910 
for your guns on the right side which
just<00:02:36.030> allows<00:02:36.150> you<00:02:36.569> to<00:02:36.750> put<00:02:37.290> your<00:02:37.440> satellites

00:02:37.910 --> 00:02:37.920 
just allows you to put your satellites

00:02:37.920 --> 00:02:40.010 
just allows you to put your satellites
in<00:02:38.069> different<00:02:38.370> positions<00:02:38.690> they<00:02:39.690> actually

00:02:40.010 --> 00:02:40.020 
in different positions they actually

00:02:40.020 --> 00:02:41.960 
in different positions they actually
work<00:02:40.140> decently<00:02:40.590> so<00:02:40.830> it's<00:02:41.190> a<00:02:41.340> shame<00:02:41.550> that<00:02:41.580> the

00:02:41.960 --> 00:02:41.970 
work decently so it's a shame that the

00:02:41.970 --> 00:02:43.430 
work decently so it's a shame that the
actual<00:02:42.180> movement<00:02:42.720> controls<00:02:43.110> you're<00:02:43.290> so

00:02:43.430 --> 00:02:43.440 
actual movement controls you're so

00:04:32.750 --> 00:04:32.760 
mystery why Ubisoft would even bother to

00:04:32.760 --> 00:04:37.810 
mystery why Ubisoft would even bother to
port<00:04:33.389> it<00:04:33.539> but<00:04:34.500> the<00:04:34.830> windows<00:04:35.220> phone<00:04:35.370> version<00:04:35.789> is
