00:00:13.760 --> 00:00:19.080
 welcome to the digital is marie 

00:00:15.870 --> 00:00:21.360
 today we will talk about the mdr h w700ds 

00:00:19.080 --> 00:00:23.760
 with which sony promises us a 

00:00:21.360 --> 00:00:25.349
 ultimate sound experience a very good 

00:00:23.760 --> 00:00:28.830
 comfort of listening and no break of 

00:00:25.349 --> 00:00:31.500
 its first of all it comes with a 

00:00:28.830 --> 00:00:33.540
 case with a processor the sound without 

00:00:31.500 --> 00:00:36.150
 wire and transmitted on a double band of 

00:00:33.540 --> 00:00:38.790
 2.4 gigahertz frequencies to avoid 

00:00:36.150 --> 00:00:40.770
 all obstacles and 5 giguÃ¨re for 

00:00:38.790 --> 00:00:42.480
 avoid radio interference 

00:00:40.770 --> 00:00:44.550
 second particular point a treatment 

00:00:42.480 --> 00:00:46.170
 multi channel audio source in 9.1 

00:00:44.550 --> 00:00:47.579
 so it's a simulation of three 

00:00:46.170 --> 00:00:49.890
 speakers in the front center speaker 

00:00:47.579 --> 00:00:51.780
 the two stereo speakers 2 together on 

00:00:49.890 --> 00:00:53.340
 the side two speakers at the back and 

00:00:51.780 --> 00:00:55.350
 two speakers above our heads 

00:00:53.340 --> 00:00:57.030
 the construction and is very robust and 

00:00:55.350 --> 00:00:58.739
 solid despite the fact that it's when 

00:00:57.030 --> 00:01:01.829
 we look a little closer to the 

00:00:58.739 --> 00:01:03.870
 plastic and faux leather despite everything 

00:01:01.829 --> 00:01:06.360
 it's good that's a lot 

00:01:03.870 --> 00:01:08.100
 lighter it is very comfortable to wear 

00:01:06.360 --> 00:01:09.300
 I wore them for two hours yesterday 

00:01:08.100 --> 00:01:11.550
 watching a movie 

00:01:09.300 --> 00:01:15.180
 no problem it's very very very 

00:01:11.550 --> 00:01:17.399
 comfortable we have a connection 

00:01:15.180 --> 00:01:20.459
 extremely comprehensive namely 3 entries 

00:01:17.399 --> 00:01:24.330
 hdmi or we can plug boxing the 

00:01:20.459 --> 00:01:27.240
 console dvd player an output hdmi arc 

00:01:24.330 --> 00:01:29.610
 for TVs that has the hdmi is 

00:01:27.240 --> 00:01:31.649
 rare that an entry and exit in 

00:01:29.610 --> 00:01:34.200
 Optical and an auxiliary input 

00:01:31.649 --> 00:01:36.209
 analog mercer we have 

00:01:34.200 --> 00:01:39.270
 settings directly on the headset for 

00:01:36.209 --> 00:01:43.770
 select hdmi hdmi entries 

00:01:39.270 --> 00:01:47.539
 2 am 2003 optics and entry 

00:01:43.770 --> 00:01:49.830
 analog we have another button 

00:01:47.539 --> 00:01:53.580
 with which we will be able to act on 

00:01:49.830 --> 00:01:55.950
 effects there is already no effect an effect 

00:01:53.580 --> 00:01:58.560
 cinema developed with sony pictures 

00:01:55.950 --> 00:02:01.380
 entertainment an effect for games 

00:01:58.560 --> 00:02:03.090
 video and an effect called voice 

00:02:01.380 --> 00:02:04.619
 which makes them more intelligible but 

00:02:03.090 --> 00:02:05.119
 which also gives a much more stereo 

00:02:04.619 --> 00:02:08.429
 large 

00:02:05.119 --> 00:02:11.700
 the sound offers a wedding spatialization 

00:02:08.429 --> 00:02:13.200
 absolutely stunning with even sometimes 

00:02:11.700 --> 00:02:15.989
 the impression that some are coming 

00:02:13.200 --> 00:02:17.760
 from above so the famous ones 

00:02:15.989 --> 00:02:20.489
 two speakers above our heads 

00:02:17.760 --> 00:02:22.860
 the bass is very percussive a little 

00:02:20.489 --> 00:02:24.810
 little too present the treble is a 

00:02:22.860 --> 00:02:25.560
 little bit back very soft very well 

00:02:24.810 --> 00:02:27.120
 defined and 

00:02:25.560 --> 00:02:30.000
 membrane reactivity is absolutely 

00:02:27.120 --> 00:02:31.860
 excellent for the negatives we 

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:34.050
 has a compressor that is not 

00:02:31.860 --> 00:02:35.910
 unfortunately not manageable from the 

00:02:34.050 --> 00:02:36.980
 headphones the bass is a little bit 

00:02:35.910 --> 00:02:39.390
 invasive as previously said 

00:02:36.980 --> 00:02:40.890
 for the search of the helmet we do not have 

00:02:39.390 --> 00:02:43.470
 of AC adapter and there is no no 

00:02:40.890 --> 00:02:45.390
 more USB ports planned in the case 

00:02:43.470 --> 00:02:48.150
 so we have to depend on a 

00:02:45.390 --> 00:02:51.000
 computer and finally the case is in 

00:02:48.150 --> 00:02:52.890
 plastic not very good quality and not 

00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:55.440
 not very resistant to scratches if we 

00:02:52.890 --> 00:02:57.510
 looking for a sedentary headset with a 

00:02:55.440 --> 00:02:59.610
 excellent sound quality can rather 

00:02:57.510 --> 00:03:02.160
 turn to the k 7 120 da kg the 

00:02:59.610 --> 00:03:04.730
 classical spirit of focal length or the 

00:03:02.160 --> 00:03:07.350
 fidelio x12 philips for example who are 

00:03:04.730 --> 00:03:09.840
 with a sound quality quite 

00:03:07.350 --> 00:03:11.849
 equivalent and that costs half the 

00:03:09.840 --> 00:03:14.459
 price on the other hand if we try to 

00:03:11.849 --> 00:03:17.160
 watch movies with a very good 

00:03:14.459 --> 00:03:18.720
 immersion without disturbing his neighbors or 

00:03:17.160 --> 00:03:22.349
 if we do not want to depend on acoustics 

00:03:18.720 --> 00:03:24.000
 of a piece in this case the hb w700 s 

00:03:22.349 --> 00:03:26.209
 worth every penny you put 

00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:26.209
 in
