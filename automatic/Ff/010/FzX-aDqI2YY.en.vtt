00:00:00.860 --> 00:00:09.710
 good afternoon welcome to our 

00:00:06.540 --> 00:00:14.420
 channel n with coffee and share with you 

00:00:09.710 --> 00:00:14.420
 achievements of Russian craftsmen 

00:00:14.870 --> 00:00:20.160
 use of mobile internet from j 

00:00:17.550 --> 00:00:22.590
 so there was such a wonderful 

00:00:20.160 --> 00:00:26.119
 virtual operator like utah here I have 

00:00:22.590 --> 00:00:26.119
 on the smartphone you have a sim card installed 

00:00:27.140 --> 00:00:33.899
 Sims management here and this and mts rus 

00:00:31.500 --> 00:00:36.780
 so about disabling data from me as 

00:00:33.899 --> 00:00:40.410
 see it so here iota offers 

00:00:36.780 --> 00:00:44.070
 tariff plan for 250 rubles which 

00:00:40.410 --> 00:00:46.980
 which included unlimited internet for 

00:00:44.070 --> 00:00:48.500
 250 rubles a ton is given some 

00:00:46.980 --> 00:00:53.670
 call package 

00:00:48.500 --> 00:00:55.469
 well , this package has more precisely this 

00:00:53.670 --> 00:00:57.809
 unlimited internet there is one 

00:00:55.469 --> 00:00:59.840
 limitation in terms of what is possible 

00:00:57.809 --> 00:01:01.949
 use only for smartphones 

00:00:59.840 --> 00:01:04.949
 any other connected device 

00:01:01.949 --> 00:01:08.360
 here via a Wi-Fi access point or 

00:01:04.949 --> 00:01:08.360
 using it which one of the smoke-smoke 

00:01:08.450 --> 00:01:13.860
 Internet will not receive Internet 

00:01:11.280 --> 00:01:17.810
 will only receive this device 

00:01:13.860 --> 00:01:20.310
 smartphone but this is how j and was conceived 

00:01:17.810 --> 00:01:22.430
 so let's look at the speed of this 

00:01:20.310 --> 00:01:24.810
 internet smartphone me 3g 

00:01:22.430 --> 00:01:27.060
 so get maximum speed 

00:01:24.810 --> 00:01:28.729
 how do we let out at 4 we 

00:01:27.060 --> 00:01:31.259
 will turn out 

00:01:28.729 --> 00:01:35.820
 but no less than 3 live enough 

00:01:31.259 --> 00:01:39.630
 to watch the video here is typical 

00:01:35.820 --> 00:01:44.250
 connection around three four megabits 

00:01:39.630 --> 00:01:46.680
 per second for a 3g smartphone and this is more 

00:01:44.250 --> 00:01:50.790
 what good do u have to kickback there speed 

00:01:46.680 --> 00:01:55.950
 it is smaller here and so this is how 

00:01:50.790 --> 00:01:58.500
 It was conceived and this way but that's what 

00:01:55.950 --> 00:02:01.460
 We did ours here on w3bsit3-dns.com 

00:01:58.500 --> 00:02:03.680
 laid out the instruction of excellent flour and 

00:02:01.460 --> 00:02:06.630
 used and modems 

00:02:03.680 --> 00:02:08.729
 here it is a modem chick from my mts because 

00:02:06.630 --> 00:02:10.710
 bought mts 827 

00:02:08.729 --> 00:02:13.230
 f he's huawei modem 

00:02:10.710 --> 00:02:17.190
 here the parameters are given in the network 

00:02:13.230 --> 00:02:19.860
 Detailed instructions on how to use this modem. 

00:02:17.190 --> 00:02:23.250
 work in general the task here is 

00:02:19.860 --> 00:02:25.710
 next to unlock it turn 

00:02:23.250 --> 00:02:28.440
 from modem to smartphone that is to it 

00:02:25.710 --> 00:02:29.720
 I thought about myself that this is a smartphone and May 

00:02:28.440 --> 00:02:31.350
 there must be another 

00:02:29.720 --> 00:02:32.880
 Recall that in the Russian 

00:02:31.350 --> 00:02:35.300
 there is no criminal law 

00:02:32.880 --> 00:02:38.490
 administrative responsibility for 

00:02:35.300 --> 00:02:40.730
 change and we still here after 

00:02:38.490 --> 00:02:44.940
 upgrades from this modem 

00:02:40.730 --> 00:02:50.940
 We use here such a unit on that 

00:02:44.940 --> 00:02:53.070
 same zyxel keenetic 4g 2 used 

00:02:50.940 --> 00:02:55.590
 just to distribute the internet to others 

00:02:53.070 --> 00:02:57.360
 Wi-Fi access point devices and 

00:02:55.590 --> 00:03:03.320
 accordingly, we are still from here the Internet 

00:02:57.360 --> 00:03:05.670
 take twill 45 use such 

00:03:03.320 --> 00:03:14.810
 we can offer the model separately 

00:03:05.670 --> 00:03:14.810
 just stick it in the laptop stuck 

00:03:15.320 --> 00:03:24.650
 how vayfay still with you to turn off 

00:03:22.110 --> 00:03:31.560
 internet access to the internet he walked 

00:03:24.650 --> 00:03:34.470
 only via modem but since modem 

00:03:31.560 --> 00:03:39.660
 4 This is the rate should already be 

00:03:34.470 --> 00:03:41.220
 Significantly higher so well with glass 

00:03:39.660 --> 00:03:43.050
 this modem to the laptop then he should 

00:03:41.220 --> 00:03:44.880
 stand there automatically page 

00:03:43.050 --> 00:03:47.820
 connect here u on and itr appeared 

00:03:44.880 --> 00:03:51.690
 the masses and we will go over and 

00:03:47.820 --> 00:03:54.000
 bookmark speedtest and produce 

00:03:51.690 --> 00:03:56.930
 speed check 

00:03:54.000 --> 00:03:56.930
 4g modems 

00:04:06.240 --> 00:04:09.500
 Well, as you see, our 

00:04:13.680 --> 00:04:21.269
 15 megabits per second could receive 

00:04:18.120 --> 00:04:22.830
 and 30 that is, it all depends of course on 

00:04:21.269 --> 00:04:23.970
 specific and weather conditions and 

00:04:22.830 --> 00:04:27.300
 network load 

00:04:23.970 --> 00:04:31.650
 but, all the same, speed is more than 

00:04:27.300 --> 00:04:39.720
 impressive so some more 

00:04:31.650 --> 00:04:41.370
 words this thing stop the test here is the average 

00:04:39.720 --> 00:04:43.740
 the speed started to fall is your access 

00:04:41.370 --> 00:04:49.110
 to the internet there is no more 

00:04:43.740 --> 00:04:52.830
 words let's say about ma himself yes here he is 

00:04:49.110 --> 00:04:54.509
 there are still two antenna outputs here 

00:04:52.830 --> 00:04:57.840
 what would be good to use 

00:04:54.509 --> 00:05:01.830
 we ordered special antennas in china 

00:04:57.840 --> 00:05:07.349
 same and wait see two outputs antenna 

00:05:01.830 --> 00:05:09.479
 this is the so-called technology mimo 2 on 

00:05:07.349 --> 00:05:12.000
 2 i.e. multiple output 

00:05:09.479 --> 00:05:12.720
 multiple input is military 

00:05:12.000 --> 00:05:15.570
 technology 

00:05:12.720 --> 00:05:18.599
 they are often used phase grating though 

00:05:15.570 --> 00:05:21.169
 and there are already used 64 to 64 circuits and 

00:05:18.599 --> 00:05:24.030
 even more then 128 by 128 

00:05:21.169 --> 00:05:27.090
 The main meaning of these antennas 

00:05:24.030 --> 00:05:29.250
 which is used in this case 

00:05:27.090 --> 00:05:31.110
 various wave polarizations 

00:05:29.250 --> 00:05:32.870
 vertically and horizontally in order 

00:05:31.110 --> 00:05:35.760
 to reduce the level of interference 

00:05:32.870 --> 00:05:39.270
 urban setting it may allow 

00:05:35.760 --> 00:05:43.020
 reduce the ratio of shumak signals thousand 

00:05:39.270 --> 00:05:45.210
 times accordingly packet loss will be 

00:05:43.020 --> 00:05:47.669
 when used it is less and 

00:05:45.210 --> 00:05:51.360
 Respectively data transfer rate 

00:05:47.669 --> 00:05:54.020
 increase even more 

00:05:51.360 --> 00:05:59.280
 anti-crisis proposal prepared 

00:05:54.020 --> 00:06:01.830
 Our Russian programmers to have 

00:05:59.280 --> 00:06:05.550
 unlimited internet for 250 rubles from 

00:06:01.830 --> 00:06:07.830
 yota and at the same time that this modem 

00:06:05.550 --> 00:06:12.419
 used no device a 

00:06:07.830 --> 00:06:16.009
 a few well, let's say thank you and you 

00:06:12.419 --> 00:06:16.009
 Thank you for your attention goodbye
