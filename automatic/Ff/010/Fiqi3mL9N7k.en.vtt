00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.899
 and hello to everyone we are on the craft channel 

00:00:02.129 --> 00:00:08.280
 Today I will show you a mechanical robot 

00:00:05.899 --> 00:00:10.679
 mechanical robot or mechanical 

00:00:08.280 --> 00:00:13.920
 robots do not know how to say well 

00:00:10.679 --> 00:00:16.099
 here he is well and let's get down to 

00:00:13.920 --> 00:00:16.099
 review 

00:00:24.980 --> 00:00:31.860
 Well, here we go to the review of the robot and 

00:00:29.630 --> 00:00:33.690
 let's start with the first 

00:00:31.860 --> 00:00:36.660
 well let's not even start again I 

00:00:33.690 --> 00:00:38.850
 I'll show you all what he looks like 

00:00:36.660 --> 00:00:42.600
 the parties are really not stupid 

00:00:38.850 --> 00:00:45.960
 like hands okay so here's back 

00:00:42.600 --> 00:00:49.890
 he has a satchel so here's yours 

00:00:45.960 --> 00:00:53.879
 knapsack hands are so big bigger than him 

00:00:49.890 --> 00:00:57.000
 enhanced so let's start with 

00:00:53.879 --> 00:01:01.519
 the first mechanism sorry if 

00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:05.729
 lag a little bit let's start 

00:01:01.519 --> 00:01:08.640
 let's go down and let's start with the first one 

00:01:05.729 --> 00:01:12.979
 mechanism called borders we break 

00:01:08.640 --> 00:01:16.530
 block with the name knapsack and number one i 

00:01:12.979 --> 00:01:19.920
 all the mechanisms that I did without them 

00:01:16.530 --> 00:01:22.049
 lava everything on water because of and re 

00:01:19.920 --> 00:01:24.479
 I did not burn his plates 

00:01:22.049 --> 00:01:28.290
 it turned out that's how we actually 

00:01:24.479 --> 00:01:31.320
 we see from our satchels water tumblr flowed 

00:01:28.290 --> 00:01:35.100
 and earlier lava was replaced by water 

00:01:31.320 --> 00:01:37.890
 that love there burned it all the whole lesson 

00:01:35.100 --> 00:01:39.800
 tanned but not all that all mechanisms 

00:01:37.890 --> 00:01:43.880
 who were 

00:01:39.800 --> 00:01:46.670
 Well, let's mechanism number two 

00:01:43.880 --> 00:01:50.030
 criminal then hands romance block 

00:01:46.670 --> 00:01:52.130
 now helps a little rain 

00:01:50.030 --> 00:01:55.670
 while the water began to flow let's fly nick 

00:01:52.130 --> 00:01:59.420
 that I was being ah fly in the miracle 

00:01:55.670 --> 00:02:03.890
 head well as we see the knife from the hands 

00:01:59.420 --> 00:02:07.250
 water flowed so well here are three sims of this 

00:02:03.890 --> 00:02:12.560
 the whole hand mechanism let's get to the next 

00:02:07.250 --> 00:02:14.960
 mechanism will proceed so next 

00:02:12.560 --> 00:02:16.190
 mechanism number three is bros but it 

00:02:14.960 --> 00:02:19.520
 to someone in shit 

00:02:16.190 --> 00:02:20.890
 or that but I just didn't know what else 

00:02:19.520 --> 00:02:25.520
 do on youtube robot 

00:02:20.890 --> 00:02:28.310
 so I ate all sorts of garbage because 

00:02:25.520 --> 00:02:31.010
 there was a lot of space in Odessa on 

00:02:28.310 --> 00:02:32.720
 battery charge which ends here 4 

00:02:31.010 --> 00:02:38.080
 the mechanism uses four charges 

00:02:32.720 --> 00:02:38.080
 it ended up there at paul such a thing 

00:02:38.910 --> 00:02:46.230
 and even had to tinker with the indicator 

00:02:41.250 --> 00:02:50.250
 to make it work so let's get down to 

00:02:46.230 --> 00:03:01.620
 mechanism number four is legs mom 

00:02:50.250 --> 00:03:07.650
 block principle you need on your feet but she 

00:03:01.620 --> 00:03:10.290
 for some reason it did not open let's go like this 

00:03:07.650 --> 00:03:20.480
 I watch a video to what happened 

00:03:10.290 --> 00:03:20.480
 mechanism well here beside us we throw 

00:03:21.920 --> 00:03:32.880
 here and here we see our legs 

00:03:29.610 --> 00:03:35.220
 opening the door well this is if your friend came 

00:03:32.880 --> 00:03:38.040
 to you robot you are on top 

00:03:35.220 --> 00:03:41.190
 break the block and the door opens 

00:03:38.040 --> 00:03:43.620
 the robot is basically there you can make an elevator 

00:03:41.190 --> 00:03:46.500
 which raised honey straight will lift you 

00:03:43.620 --> 00:03:52.500
 you straight up premku 

00:03:46.500 --> 00:03:55.950
 Well, right to you here and here we are 

00:03:52.500 --> 00:04:02.450
 let's start the mechanism number 5 and this is the heart 

00:03:55.950 --> 00:04:05.220
 home in my god so again I'm sorry 

00:04:02.450 --> 00:04:06.330
 lost forgot to break yes here was 

00:04:05.220 --> 00:04:09.660
 to others 

00:04:06.330 --> 00:04:14.040
 i forgot to break right away sorry already 

00:04:09.660 --> 00:04:16.350
 the second time, well, it's like we have that 

00:04:14.040 --> 00:04:19.500
 inside the robot is true here already more 

00:04:16.350 --> 00:04:22.669
 part of the mechanisms spent so we do not 

00:04:19.500 --> 00:04:25.500
 we will see what if left 

00:04:22.669 --> 00:04:28.650
 let's proceed to the next mechanism 

00:04:25.500 --> 00:04:30.870
 and this mechanism is called off 

00:04:28.650 --> 00:04:32.660
 he turns off all the water mechanisms 

00:04:30.870 --> 00:04:34.610
 which is u robot 

00:04:32.660 --> 00:04:38.000
 I had these mechanisms 

00:04:34.610 --> 00:04:41.840
 tinker well let's see what it is 

00:04:38.000 --> 00:04:44.960
 happened and I want to tell you something that I 

00:04:41.840 --> 00:04:47.420
 in front of this video did not review 

00:04:44.960 --> 00:04:50.360
 I did not check the robot how it works 

00:04:47.420 --> 00:04:55.580
 so I don’t know summer from work 

00:04:50.360 --> 00:04:59.300
 or not now we ourselves will see how 

00:04:55.580 --> 00:05:04.430
 we see it seems our hand is disconnected 

00:04:59.300 --> 00:05:07.730
 Now I’m looking at that one 

00:05:04.430 --> 00:05:13.280
 because lags so much let's 

00:05:07.730 --> 00:05:18.560
 let's go so yourself a little bit now 

00:05:13.280 --> 00:05:23.450
 progruzutsya yes here we have hand knapsack water 

00:05:18.560 --> 00:05:25.660
 cleaned and it is very good so I do not know 

00:05:23.450 --> 00:05:28.790
 why very well okay 

00:05:25.660 --> 00:05:30.620
 his latest mechanism in this mechanism 

00:05:28.790 --> 00:05:35.390
 oh in this robot 

00:05:30.620 --> 00:05:38.750
 8 mechanisms and this is the last mechanism 

00:05:35.390 --> 00:05:40.840
 no, not the last and this is charging now we 

00:05:38.750 --> 00:05:44.200
 let's see how much we spent 

00:05:40.840 --> 00:05:46.820
 charging first 

00:05:44.200 --> 00:05:49.100
 Well, as we see, we have all the charging 

00:05:46.820 --> 00:05:52.940
 spent because it's all gray 

00:05:49.100 --> 00:05:55.100
 but the whole engrave it must be sand oh 

00:05:52.940 --> 00:05:57.500
 Sorry for not showing how it ends 

00:05:55.100 --> 00:06:01.660
 battery charge I forgot to cheat about it 

00:05:57.500 --> 00:06:02.930
 let's charge him 

00:06:01.660 --> 00:06:05.120
 batteries 

00:06:02.930 --> 00:06:08.300
 no mechanisms will recover it 

00:06:05.120 --> 00:06:10.100
 just for the beauty of things as he said 

00:06:08.300 --> 00:06:12.800
 oh years i didn't know what else to do in this 

00:06:10.100 --> 00:06:19.060
 so the robot was very small 

00:06:12.800 --> 00:06:21.650
 places and a lot of mechanisms to him 

00:06:19.060 --> 00:06:23.540
 fit and there was little to come up with 

00:06:21.650 --> 00:06:26.660
 this robot well that's how we see on 

00:06:23.540 --> 00:06:29.160
 charged battery and let's 

00:06:26.660 --> 00:06:31.230
 let's get down to the last mechanism 

00:06:29.160 --> 00:06:32.160
 but the last mechanism is probably 

00:06:31.230 --> 00:06:35.130
 already guessed 

00:06:32.160 --> 00:06:38.060
 Well, someone guessed it is not if you took 

00:06:35.130 --> 00:06:41.910
 hand lighter means abs he is destruction 

00:06:38.060 --> 00:06:47.010
 so now I sort of remember that a little bit 

00:06:41.910 --> 00:06:48.810
 this is wrong now where did 

00:06:47.010 --> 00:06:51.450
 where loves here will fall to 

00:06:48.810 --> 00:06:56.640
 how to break a little bit under them 

00:06:51.450 --> 00:06:57.710
 and it is here that he will undermine everything so we 

00:06:56.640 --> 00:07:01.950
 we fly up 

00:06:57.710 --> 00:07:03.930
 on my blog so now specifically 

00:07:01.950 --> 00:07:06.840
 take off quickly to see him 

00:07:03.930 --> 00:07:07.940
 exploded and quickly fly off while me 

00:07:06.840 --> 00:07:12.320
 did not help 

00:07:07.940 --> 00:07:16.460
 him let's rub as he was exploding 

00:07:12.320 --> 00:07:19.200
 so what about his robot 

00:07:16.460 --> 00:07:22.700
 hit only flying 

00:07:19.200 --> 00:07:25.620
 pieces leave the robot airborne 

00:07:22.700 --> 00:07:29.880
 this robot and a stroll themselves nowhere 

00:07:25.620 --> 00:07:32.010
 I downloaded it seems to be the most 

00:07:29.880 --> 00:07:35.700
 first robots in minecraft 

00:07:32.010 --> 00:07:38.280
 I do not know for sure, but in Russian you are Russian 

00:07:35.700 --> 00:07:41.160
 still youtobe have not yet seen robots 

00:07:38.280 --> 00:07:43.830
 mechanical menkravte and died 

00:07:41.160 --> 00:07:46.140
 Americans, I did not look maybe they 

00:07:43.830 --> 00:07:48.240
 I don't know, but who liked it 

00:07:46.140 --> 00:07:51.770
 video like subscribe to 

00:07:48.240 --> 00:07:51.770
 channel all good luck all bye
