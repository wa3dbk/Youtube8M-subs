and<00:01:10.420> then<00:01:10.930> just<00:01:11.170> with<00:01:11.649> some<00:01:11.860> modular<00:01:12.340> pieces

00:01:12.600 --> 00:01:12.610 
and then just with some modular pieces

00:01:12.610 --> 00:01:14.639 
and then just with some modular pieces
putting<00:01:13.390> them<00:01:13.539> together<00:01:13.719> and<00:01:14.289> then<00:01:14.439> just

00:01:14.639 --> 00:01:14.649 
putting them together and then just

changing<00:01:15.130> up<00:01:15.280> some<00:01:15.490> of<00:01:15.610> the<00:01:15.729> ways<00:01:15.909> that<00:01:16.119> things

00:01:16.350 --> 00:01:16.360 
changing up some of the ways that things

00:01:16.360 --> 00:01:19.260 
changing up some of the ways that things
are<00:01:16.570> folded<00:01:16.930> with<00:01:17.890> the<00:01:18.009> pieces<00:01:18.250> initially<00:01:19.060> so

00:01:19.260 --> 00:01:19.270 
are folded with the pieces initially so

00:01:19.270 --> 00:01:20.609 
are folded with the pieces initially so
that<00:01:19.390> you<00:01:19.450> get<00:01:19.600> different<00:01:19.840> kinds<00:01:20.320> of<00:01:20.380> really

00:01:20.609 --> 00:01:20.619 
that you get different kinds of really

00:01:20.619 --> 00:01:23.249 
that you get different kinds of really
cool<00:01:20.890> pin<00:01:21.189> wheel<00:01:21.399> designs<00:01:21.820> really<00:01:22.750> colorful

00:01:23.249 --> 00:01:23.259 
cool pin wheel designs really colorful

00:01:23.259 --> 00:01:26.219 
cool pin wheel designs really colorful
finished<00:01:23.649> pieces<00:01:24.189> and<00:01:24.539> the<00:01:25.539> thing<00:01:25.719> I<00:01:25.810> like<00:01:26.020> so

00:01:26.219 --> 00:01:26.229 
finished pieces and the thing I like so

00:01:26.229 --> 00:01:28.440 
finished pieces and the thing I like so
much<00:01:26.289> about<00:01:26.409> it<00:01:26.859> is<00:01:27.100> that<00:01:27.130> her<00:01:27.759> directions<00:01:28.090> are

00:01:28.440 --> 00:01:28.450 
much about it is that her directions are

00:01:28.450 --> 00:01:31.590 
much about it is that her directions are
super<00:01:28.930> easy<00:01:29.170> to<00:01:29.619> understand<00:01:30.329> there's<00:01:31.329> really

00:01:31.590 --> 00:01:31.600 
super easy to understand there's really

00:01:31.600 --> 00:01:33.990 
super easy to understand there's really
clear<00:01:32.049> illustrations<00:01:33.009> that<00:01:33.219> go<00:01:33.369> from<00:01:33.520> step<00:01:33.820> to

00:01:33.990 --> 00:01:34.000 
clear illustrations that go from step to

00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:36.779 
clear illustrations that go from step to
step<00:01:34.259> also<00:01:35.259> the<00:01:35.530> folding<00:01:35.920> itself<00:01:36.280> is<00:01:36.429> not<00:01:36.579> that

00:01:36.779 --> 00:01:36.789 
step also the folding itself is not that

00:01:36.789 --> 00:01:39.149 
step also the folding itself is not that
hard<00:01:37.119> so<00:01:37.570> it's<00:01:37.899> not<00:01:37.990> that<00:01:38.109> discouraging<00:01:38.920> to<00:01:39.130> a

00:01:39.149 --> 00:01:39.159 
hard so it's not that discouraging to a

00:01:39.159 --> 00:01:41.459 
hard so it's not that discouraging to a
beginner<00:01:39.549> to<00:01:39.789> try<00:01:40.060> to<00:01:40.119> make<00:01:40.509> one<00:01:40.719> of<00:01:40.840> her<00:01:40.960> boxes

00:01:41.459 --> 00:01:41.469 
beginner to try to make one of her boxes

00:01:41.469 --> 00:01:45.690 
beginner to try to make one of her boxes
I<00:01:41.710> also<00:01:42.310> think<00:01:42.700> that<00:01:43.049> you<00:01:44.049> know<00:01:44.619> it's<00:01:44.799> the<00:01:44.950> fun

00:01:45.690 --> 00:01:45.700 
I also think that you know it's the fun

00:01:45.700 --> 00:01:47.639 
I also think that you know it's the fun
part<00:01:46.060> of<00:01:46.210> it<00:01:46.329> is<00:01:46.479> that<00:01:46.509> you're<00:01:47.140> doing<00:01:47.200> a

00:01:47.639 --> 00:01:47.649 
part of it is that you're doing a

00:01:47.649 --> 00:01:50.099 
part of it is that you're doing a
modular<00:01:48.130> origami<00:01:48.310> project<00:01:48.999> and<00:01:49.539> you<00:01:49.899> might

00:01:50.099 --> 00:01:50.109 
modular origami project and you might

00:01:50.109 --> 00:01:54.270 
modular origami project and you might
need<00:01:50.380> for<00:01:51.009> 8<00:01:51.820> 10<00:01:52.420> 12<00:01:52.600> 15<00:01:52.840> 16<00:01:53.499> pieces<00:01:53.799> of<00:01:54.070> paper

00:01:54.270 --> 00:01:54.280 
need for 8 10 12 15 16 pieces of paper

00:01:54.280 --> 00:01:57.149

00:03:42.850 --> 00:03:46.840 
so this is one of my pride and joys and
I<00:03:44.050> just<00:03:45.050> enjoyed<00:03:45.440> making<00:03:45.709> her<00:03:46.010> boxes<00:03:46.430> so<00:03:46.640> much

00:03:46.840 --> 00:03:46.850 
I just enjoyed making her boxes so much

00:03:46.850 --> 00:03:49.720 
I just enjoyed making her boxes so much
and<00:03:47.180> I<00:03:47.330> think<00:03:47.600> from<00:03:48.140> as<00:03:48.440> a<00:03:48.470> beginner<00:03:49.130> and<00:03:49.489> just

00:03:49.720 --> 00:03:49.730 
and I think from as a beginner and just

00:03:49.730 --> 00:03:51.120 
and I think from as a beginner and just
looking<00:03:50.000> at<00:03:50.120> those<00:03:50.269> really<00:03:50.660> clear

00:03:51.120 --> 00:03:51.130 
looking at those really clear

00:03:51.130 --> 00:03:53.979 
looking at those really clear
easy-to-follow<00:03:52.130> descriptions<00:03:52.930> the<00:03:53.930> only

00:03:53.979 --> 00:03:53.989 
easy-to-follow descriptions the only

00:03:53.989 --> 00:03:56.470 
easy-to-follow descriptions the only
thing<00:03:54.380> I<00:03:54.470> think<00:03:54.650> I<00:03:54.800> would<00:03:54.950> give<00:03:55.130> any<00:03:55.480> argument

00:03:56.470 --> 00:03:56.480 
thing I think I would give any argument

00:03:56.480 --> 00:03:58.570 
thing I think I would give any argument
to<00:03:56.630> is<00:03:56.780> that<00:03:56.930> some<00:03:57.310> description<00:03:58.310> of<00:03:58.400> how<00:03:58.519> to

00:03:58.570 --> 00:03:58.580 
to is that some description of how to

00:03:58.580 --> 00:04:00.850 
to is that some description of how to
piece<00:03:58.910> things<00:03:59.209> together<00:03:59.510> is<00:03:59.959> maybe<00:04:00.500> not<00:04:00.709> as

00:04:00.850 --> 00:04:00.860 
piece things together is maybe not as

00:04:00.860 --> 00:04:03.310 
piece things together is maybe not as
clear<00:04:01.340> as<00:04:02.000> it<00:04:02.060> could<00:04:02.420> be<00:04:02.450> and<00:04:02.690> that's<00:04:03.080> where

00:04:03.310 --> 00:04:03.320 
clear as it could be and that's where

00:04:03.320 --> 00:04:05.590 
clear as it could be and that's where
certainly<00:04:03.830> videos<00:04:04.310> come<00:04:04.640> into<00:04:04.880> play<00:04:05.090> so<00:04:05.150> much

00:04:05.590 --> 00:04:05.600 
certainly videos come into play so much

00:04:05.600 --> 00:04:07.780 
certainly videos come into play so much
and<00:04:05.900> I<00:04:05.930> just<00:04:05.959> wish<00:04:06.410> that<00:04:07.130> the<00:04:07.280> whole<00:04:07.430> world<00:04:07.580> of

00:04:07.780 --> 00:04:07.790 
and I just wish that the whole world of

00:04:07.790 --> 00:04:09.340 
and I just wish that the whole world of
origami<00:04:08.180> was<00:04:08.450> a<00:04:08.480> little<00:04:08.690> more<00:04:08.810> open<00:04:09.170> to

00:04:09.340 --> 00:04:09.350 
origami was a little more open to

00:04:09.350 --> 00:04:11.170 
origami was a little more open to
sharing<00:04:09.380> that<00:04:09.950> world<00:04:10.370> through<00:04:10.820> videos

00:04:11.170 --> 00:04:11.180 
sharing that world through videos

00:04:11.180 --> 00:04:13.180 
sharing that world through videos
because<00:04:11.510> I<00:04:11.600> think<00:04:11.660> it's<00:04:11.959> so<00:04:12.080> hard<00:04:12.380> to<00:04:12.470> visually

00:04:13.180 --> 00:04:13.190 
because I think it's so hard to visually

00:04:13.190 --> 00:04:15.550 
because I think it's so hard to visually
in<00:04:13.370> a<00:04:13.459> two-dimensional<00:04:13.820> drawing<00:04:14.600> description
