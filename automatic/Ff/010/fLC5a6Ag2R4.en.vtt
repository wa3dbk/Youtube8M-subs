00:00:00.689 --> 00:00:07.089
 wave band here from a new felines 

00:00:04.390 --> 00:00:09.580
 commenting on this new video since 

00:00:07.089 --> 00:00:12.460
 we are in micros of the xbox 360 edition and 

00:00:09.580 --> 00:00:14.740
 we are in a new tutorial of 

00:00:12.460 --> 00:00:17.050
 how to make the villagers 

00:00:14.740 --> 00:00:19.300
 reproduce in whatever their villages and 

00:00:17.050 --> 00:00:22.000
 all that not here I have two little houses 

00:00:19.300 --> 00:00:23.770
 that I have made artificially I believe them 

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:27.790
 and they are all you see but nothing happens 

00:00:23.770 --> 00:00:29.920
 well let's spam some villagers 

00:00:27.790 --> 00:00:33.870
 in each of these houses consist one 

00:00:29.920 --> 00:00:36.670
 there and another one here and good the villagers 

00:00:33.870 --> 00:00:40.140
 what they have their minecraft code is 

00:00:36.670 --> 00:00:42.550
 the following for there to be a 

00:00:40.140 --> 00:00:45.640
 reproduction among the villagers should 

00:00:42.550 --> 00:00:47.769
 have more space in whatever your village 

00:00:45.640 --> 00:00:49.690
 that is to say here I have two houses for 

00:00:47.769 --> 00:00:51.789
 the villagers can make another house and there 

00:00:49.690 --> 00:00:54.190
 now they can be reproduced and now 

00:00:51.789 --> 00:00:56.620
 they already have another villager who lives in that 

00:00:54.190 --> 00:00:58.780
 home but here there is as a type of 

00:00:56.620 --> 00:01:01.089
 benefit that we can use our 

00:00:58.780 --> 00:01:04.260
 please what is that benefit 

00:01:01.089 --> 00:01:07.260
 well the benefit is the following ones 

00:01:04.260 --> 00:01:10.290
 villagers 

00:01:07.260 --> 00:01:12.480
 how predefined a house is where 

00:01:10.290 --> 00:01:14.970
 There is a door, that is, you can put 

00:01:12.480 --> 00:01:17.160
 thousands of doors around and the 

00:01:14.970 --> 00:01:19.530
 villagers are going to reproduce because 

00:01:17.160 --> 00:01:22.920
 they are thinking that a door represents 

00:01:19.530 --> 00:01:25.620
 a house is something illogical can receive 

00:01:22.920 --> 00:01:27.720
 your code in minecraft and this we can 

00:01:25.620 --> 00:01:30.350
 use in our favor as to do 

00:01:27.720 --> 00:01:33.259
 factories than it would be 

00:01:30.350 --> 00:01:35.450
 and iron that soon if you can 

00:01:33.259 --> 00:01:37.759
 I will make a tutorial that is a factory 

00:01:35.450 --> 00:01:40.460
 a bit difficult but they are very good 

00:01:37.759 --> 00:01:43.430
 factories and as I tell you this is a bit 

00:01:40.460 --> 00:01:46.580
 illogical since the villagers take for 

00:01:43.430 --> 00:01:48.350
 a house a door and good is that 

00:01:46.580 --> 00:01:51.830
 way is how they mate if you 

00:01:48.350 --> 00:01:54.049
 you make another door is that way of 

00:01:51.830 --> 00:01:56.270
 that way they are to rest and they go to 

00:01:54.049 --> 00:01:59.539
 think it 's another house at this time 

00:01:56.270 --> 00:02:02.539
 I could put another put here and 

00:01:59.539 --> 00:02:06.950
 another one here and this they would take it as 

00:02:02.539 --> 00:02:09.410
 others a double house so to call it is 

00:02:06.950 --> 00:02:11.420
 that's why what is called rebuke 

00:02:09.410 --> 00:02:14.630
 towards the villages that we always find 

00:02:11.420 --> 00:02:17.630
 we found houses with one door, nothing else 

00:02:14.630 --> 00:02:19.940
 that's why we're going to look for the doors and we're going 

00:02:17.630 --> 00:02:21.709
 to place some here in the same way 

00:02:19.940 --> 00:02:23.750
 to build another house so they can see that 

00:02:21.709 --> 00:02:25.190
 They reproduce the villagers although 

00:02:23.750 --> 00:02:27.500
 it takes a day to pass 

00:02:25.190 --> 00:02:29.290
 approximately so that they reproduce 

00:02:27.500 --> 00:02:31.810
 and all that does not 

00:02:29.290 --> 00:02:34.450
 so well let's build another 

00:02:31.810 --> 00:02:36.400
 little house does not have to be of such a size 

00:02:34.450 --> 00:02:38.680
 that everything is wow I have to be it from a 

00:02:36.400 --> 00:02:41.200
 Giant size has to be a size 

00:02:38.680 --> 00:02:44.980
 in which they can fit not in this case 

00:02:41.200 --> 00:02:47.590
 I'm doing 4 x 4 so the 

00:02:44.980 --> 00:02:49.720
 title for 4 because so small because 

00:02:47.590 --> 00:02:51.970
 it's the economic way that's why 

00:02:49.720 --> 00:02:54.400
 right now there is not much money to 

00:02:51.970 --> 00:02:55.569
 make the houses to the villagers so 

00:02:54.400 --> 00:02:57.909
 nothing, we are going to build a small 

00:02:55.569 --> 00:03:00.430
 house and as I tell you this we could 

00:02:57.909 --> 00:03:03.220
 serve to do what would be respawn 

00:03:00.430 --> 00:03:05.290
 in what would be the ones I already said what 

00:03:03.220 --> 00:03:08.470
 would be twice I did not like this phrase 

00:03:05.290 --> 00:03:11.590
 and this will help us to be able to make 

00:03:08.470 --> 00:03:15.579
 make them bread what would be always say 

00:03:11.590 --> 00:03:17.620
 the same do they put the goals of 

00:03:15.579 --> 00:03:20.079
 iron because as you know the golems 

00:03:17.620 --> 00:03:22.299
 they appear whatever a few villages and 

00:03:20.079 --> 00:03:25.780
 right now I explain why a golem of 

00:03:22.299 --> 00:03:27.909
 iron responds to in a village every time 

00:03:25.780 --> 00:03:31.100
 that this village has good at the same time 

00:03:27.909 --> 00:03:33.860
 will come out have 16 villagers 

00:03:31.100 --> 00:03:35.780
 that they live there because a villa is taken 

00:03:33.860 --> 00:03:39.470
 how are these three little houses this is a 

00:03:35.780 --> 00:03:42.170
 villa a village would already be 16 

00:03:39.470 --> 00:03:44.900
 inhabitants so that's the logic 

00:03:42.170 --> 00:03:47.090
 better let's put this here and 

00:03:44.900 --> 00:03:49.250
 Now we are going to see the miners and 

00:03:47.090 --> 00:03:51.320
 nothing will I cut high to my design at 

00:03:49.250 --> 00:03:54.800
 video place the list ceiling the 

00:03:51.320 --> 00:03:58.310
 business right now I'm going to cut the video and 

00:03:54.800 --> 00:04:00.290
 I'll wait and spent a day and at a 

00:03:58.310 --> 00:04:03.350
 Once that day has passed since you have already 

00:04:00.290 --> 00:04:06.320
 I teach happens they have reduced or they have not 

00:04:03.350 --> 00:04:08.750
 past nothing and what happened not so nothing 

00:04:06.320 --> 00:04:12.230
 we just put the roof here over here 

00:04:08.750 --> 00:04:14.980
 and now let's go back so right now 

00:04:12.230 --> 00:04:14.980
 we come back 

00:04:16.170 --> 00:04:21.720
 and well I'm back and here we 

00:04:19.470 --> 00:04:23.700
 new to the village and the only thing I've done 

00:04:21.720 --> 00:04:25.800
 is to put doors to the sides 

00:04:23.700 --> 00:04:27.620
 to make it a little faster 

00:04:25.800 --> 00:04:31.440
 process because it was not going to be all 

00:04:27.620 --> 00:04:33.450
 the day waiting and waiting for it 

00:04:31.440 --> 00:04:35.280
 reproduce so you also have a 

00:04:33.450 --> 00:04:38.190
 little leaves like that to see it a little more 

00:04:35.280 --> 00:04:42.540
 natural and have already had their first 

00:04:38.190 --> 00:04:45.009
 own procreation is a mini villager 

00:04:42.540 --> 00:04:48.849
 it's super cute 

00:04:45.009 --> 00:04:51.789
 super wanting to grab it and throw 

00:04:48.849 --> 00:04:54.759
 the drawings are super curious I do not know why 

00:04:51.789 --> 00:04:56.710
 what though all the little ones are curious 

00:04:54.759 --> 00:04:59.889
 that is something like that and you stay or 

00:04:56.710 --> 00:05:02.289
 Look at a little girl but good, well, how 

00:04:59.889 --> 00:05:05.399
 they are watching so the 

00:05:02.289 --> 00:05:09.159
 villagers you have to make a house more and 

00:05:05.399 --> 00:05:11.680
 putting doors putting a lot of things and 

00:05:09.159 --> 00:05:14.770
 I also have some gravels and for 

00:05:11.680 --> 00:05:17.020
 give a touch more villager like elena 

00:05:14.770 --> 00:05:19.330
 Here a villager has already started living 

00:05:17.020 --> 00:05:21.490
 they went to live elsewhere I also put 

00:05:19.330 --> 00:05:24.399
 two other villagers so that a start is 

00:05:21.490 --> 00:05:26.860
 little more from where the family so 

00:05:24.399 --> 00:05:28.300
 Well, I'm the only one who loves you 

00:05:26.860 --> 00:05:30.520
 say how is it also I do not know if the 

00:05:28.300 --> 00:05:32.229
 mini villager and do not know how to open 

00:05:30.520 --> 00:05:34.419
 doors because I can get in the 

00:05:32.229 --> 00:05:37.270
 side and you can not get into the house 

00:05:34.419 --> 00:05:39.719
 so I give him to open the door because 

00:05:37.270 --> 00:05:42.040
 They do not know how get in there are 

00:05:39.719 --> 00:05:46.900
 get in 

00:05:42.040 --> 00:05:48.790
 and of course you take the doors and then 

00:05:46.900 --> 00:05:50.860
 this is how the villagers reproduce 

00:05:48.790 --> 00:05:53.710
 you have to go putting houses doors 

00:05:50.860 --> 00:05:55.690
 although to accelerate it and it 's in a bit 

00:05:53.710 --> 00:05:57.280
 faster than I put doors here you 

00:05:55.690 --> 00:06:00.190
 You can do it the way you do 

00:05:57.280 --> 00:06:02.260
 you want as you like and I recommend you 

00:06:00.190 --> 00:06:05.410
 that you make cheap houses you do not see 

00:06:02.260 --> 00:06:07.600
 exaggerated in a super mansion for the 

00:06:05.410 --> 00:06:09.910
 villagers because it does not matter if the 

00:06:07.600 --> 00:06:11.800
 succession lover does not leave them his and now 

00:06:09.910 --> 00:06:14.020
 I do not know why nobody goes to me here before 

00:06:11.800 --> 00:06:16.330
 a person lived but good I hope that 

00:06:14.020 --> 00:06:19.180
 have you liked this little tutorial or 

00:06:16.330 --> 00:06:21.610
 as a review of how to make it 

00:06:19.180 --> 00:06:23.320
 reproduce the villagers so nothing 

00:06:21.610 --> 00:06:25.630
 remember that you can share it in your 

00:06:23.320 --> 00:06:28.390
 social networks and you give me a like or not 

00:06:25.630 --> 00:06:33.060
 thank you very much and thank you very much 

00:06:28.390 --> 00:06:33.060
 for watching the video a greeting or goodbye
