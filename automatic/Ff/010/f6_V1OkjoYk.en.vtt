core<00:01:39.990> through<00:01:40.259> and<00:01:40.470> then<00:01:40.770> glued<00:01:41.400> the<00:01:41.759> inside

00:01:42.080 --> 00:01:42.090 
core through and then glued the inside

00:01:42.090 --> 00:01:43.630

end now you have to be careful because
remember<00:01:44.640> wigs<00:01:44.970> fit<00:01:45.240> everyone's<00:01:45.689> head

00:01:45.859 --> 00:01:45.869 
remember wigs fit everyone's head

00:01:45.869 --> 00:01:48.530 
remember wigs fit everyone's head
differently<00:01:46.290> and<00:01:46.530> if<00:01:47.040> this<00:01:47.850> if<00:01:48.119> my<00:01:48.299> head<00:01:48.420> had

00:01:48.530 --> 00:01:48.540 
differently and if this if my head had

00:01:48.540 --> 00:01:50.630 
differently and if this if my head had
been<00:01:48.570> bigger<00:01:48.899> the<00:01:49.560> wig<00:01:49.770> wouldn't<00:01:50.100> have<00:01:50.340> fit<00:01:50.549> on

00:01:50.630 --> 00:01:50.640 
been bigger the wig wouldn't have fit on

00:01:50.640 --> 00:01:52.580 
been bigger the wig wouldn't have fit on
my<00:01:50.759> head<00:01:50.939> afterwards<00:01:51.420> because<00:01:51.720> it's<00:01:52.409> not

00:01:52.580 --> 00:01:52.590 
my head afterwards because it's not

00:01:52.590 --> 00:01:54.649 
my head afterwards because it's not
flexible<00:01:53.070> and<00:01:53.280> nearly<00:01:53.790> as<00:01:53.939> flexible<00:01:54.360> anymore

00:01:54.649 --> 00:01:54.659 
flexible and nearly as flexible anymore

00:01:54.659 --> 00:01:56.060 
flexible and nearly as flexible anymore
cuz<00:01:54.780> you<00:01:54.840> take<00:01:55.020> out<00:01:55.140> a<00:01:55.170> lot<00:01:55.350> of<00:01:55.439> the<00:01:55.530> elastic<00:01:55.799> by

00:01:56.060 --> 00:01:56.070 
cuz you take out a lot of the elastic by

00:01:56.070 --> 00:01:58.010 
cuz you take out a lot of the elastic by
cutting<00:01:56.340> that<00:01:56.430> hole<00:01:56.640> next<00:01:57.630> thing<00:01:57.750> I<00:01:57.810> want<00:01:57.990> to

00:01:58.010 --> 00:01:58.020 
cutting that hole next thing I want to

00:01:58.020 --> 00:02:01.310 
cutting that hole next thing I want to
do<00:01:58.170> is<00:01:58.250> take<00:01:59.250> your<00:01:59.430> extensions<00:02:00.000> and<00:02:00.210> hot<00:02:01.110> glue

00:02:01.310 --> 00:02:01.320 
do is take your extensions and hot glue

00:02:01.320 --> 00:02:03.740 
do is take your extensions and hot glue
them<00:02:01.560> or<00:02:02.280> glue<00:02:02.579> them<00:02:02.700> or<00:02:02.820> just<00:02:02.850> in<00:02:03.180> some<00:02:03.390> method

00:02:03.740 --> 00:02:03.750 
them or glue them or just in some method

00:02:03.750 --> 00:02:07.520 
them or glue them or just in some method
it's<00:02:04.170> up<00:02:04.350> to<00:02:04.380> you<00:02:04.649> I<00:02:05.030> passion<00:02:06.030> them<00:02:06.149> to<00:02:06.530> this

00:02:07.520 --> 00:02:07.530 
it's up to you I passion them to this

00:02:07.530 --> 00:02:09.559 
it's up to you I passion them to this
star<00:02:07.799> from<00:02:08.009> so<00:02:08.670> it<00:02:08.940> doesn't<00:02:09.179> look<00:02:09.239> like<00:02:09.300> those

00:02:09.559 --> 00:02:09.569 
star from so it doesn't look like those

00:02:09.569 --> 00:02:10.910 
star from so it doesn't look like those
big<00:02:09.720> styrofoam<00:02:10.140> pieces<00:02:10.259> coming<00:02:10.560> out<00:02:10.709> of<00:02:10.739> the

00:02:10.910 --> 00:02:10.920 
big styrofoam pieces coming out of the

00:02:10.920 --> 00:02:12.830 
big styrofoam pieces coming out of the
break<00:02:11.009> it<00:02:11.220> looks<00:02:11.489> like<00:02:11.640> there's<00:02:11.819> just<00:02:12.360> hair

00:02:12.830 --> 00:02:12.840 
break it looks like there's just hair

00:02:12.840 --> 00:02:16.430 
break it looks like there's just hair
now<00:02:13.260> I<00:02:13.970> didn't<00:02:14.970> glue<00:02:15.360> along<00:02:15.569> the<00:02:15.750> sides<00:02:15.959> I<00:02:16.140> just

00:02:16.430 --> 00:02:16.440 
now I didn't glue along the sides I just

00:02:16.440 --> 00:02:18.940 
now I didn't glue along the sides I just
wrap<00:02:16.890> the<00:02:17.040> hair<00:02:17.220> around<00:02:17.280> the<00:02:17.550> tip<00:02:17.760> and<00:02:17.970> glued

00:02:18.940 --> 00:02:18.950 
wrap the hair around the tip and glued

00:02:18.950 --> 00:02:21.350 
wrap the hair around the tip and glued
so<00:02:19.950> because<00:02:20.730> I<00:02:20.819> knew<00:02:20.940> there<00:02:21.060> was<00:02:21.150> going<00:02:21.239> to<00:02:21.330> be

00:02:21.350 --> 00:02:21.360 
so because I knew there was going to be

00:02:21.360 --> 00:02:25.190 
so because I knew there was going to be
hair<00:02:21.900> going<00:02:22.440> over<00:02:22.830> that<00:02:23.010> layer<00:02:23.370> anyway<00:02:24.140> next<00:02:25.140> I

00:02:25.190 --> 00:02:25.200 
hair going over that layer anyway next I

00:02:25.200 --> 00:02:28.910 
hair going over that layer anyway next I
took<00:02:25.260> my<00:02:25.500> extra<00:02:25.830> extensions<00:02:26.340> and<00:02:26.580> I<00:02:27.920> put

goes back to the thing where you have to

00:03:05.400 --> 00:03:07.130 
goes back to the thing where you have to
note<00:03:05.549> that<00:03:05.579> you<00:03:06.269> have<00:03:06.390> to<00:03:06.540> know<00:03:06.720> how<00:03:06.750> the<00:03:06.959> wig

fits<00:03:07.349> on<00:03:07.470> your<00:03:07.500> head<00:03:07.709> because<00:03:07.860> obviously<00:03:08.190> I

00:03:08.449 --> 00:03:08.459 
fits on your head because obviously I

00:03:11.360 --> 00:03:11.370 
used hot glue because I knew that the

00:03:11.370 --> 00:03:13.850 
used hot glue because I knew that the
wig<00:03:11.549> was<00:03:11.730> going<00:03:11.910> to<00:03:11.970> fit<00:03:12.470> snugly<00:03:13.470> on<00:03:13.590> my<00:03:13.709> head

00:03:13.850 --> 00:03:13.860 
wig was going to fit snugly on my head

00:03:13.860 --> 00:03:16.430 
wig was going to fit snugly on my head
and<00:03:14.010> it<00:03:14.099> wasn't<00:03:14.340> going<00:03:14.430> to<00:03:14.489> be<00:03:14.599> too<00:03:15.599> small<00:03:15.930> so

00:03:16.430 --> 00:03:16.440 
and it wasn't going to be too small so

00:03:16.440 --> 00:03:20.420 
and it wasn't going to be too small so
once<00:03:16.859> you<00:03:16.980> have<00:03:17.100> all<00:03:17.310> that<00:03:17.850> bulk<00:03:18.120> in<00:03:18.299> there<00:03:19.430> you

00:03:20.420 --> 00:03:20.430 
once you have all that bulk in there you

00:03:20.430 --> 00:03:24.890 
once you have all that bulk in there you
are<00:03:20.670> simply<00:03:21.389> lift<00:03:22.049> up<00:03:22.260> the<00:03:22.410> back<00:03:22.590> and<00:03:23.630> wrap<00:03:24.630> it

00:03:24.890 --> 00:03:24.900 
are simply lift up the back and wrap it

00:03:24.900 --> 00:03:30.140 
are simply lift up the back and wrap it
around<00:03:24.959> the<00:03:25.500> two<00:03:27.019> of<00:03:28.019> the<00:03:28.230> two<00:03:28.470> cones<00:03:28.859> and<00:03:29.220> I

00:03:30.140 --> 00:03:30.150 
around the two of the two cones and I

00:03:30.150 --> 00:03:32.629 
around the two of the two cones and I
used<00:03:30.870> a<00:03:31.079> few<00:03:31.440> pins<00:03:31.739> here<00:03:32.069> and<00:03:32.220> there<00:03:32.400> but

00:03:32.629 --> 00:03:32.639 
used a few pins here and there but

00:03:32.639 --> 00:03:35.629 
used a few pins here and there but
mostly<00:03:33.359> it<00:03:33.930> just<00:03:34.470> stayed<00:03:35.010> on<00:03:35.130> its<00:03:35.280> own<00:03:35.430> I

00:03:35.629 --> 00:03:35.639 
mostly it just stayed on its own I

00:03:35.639 --> 00:03:37.670 
mostly it just stayed on its own I
didn't<00:03:36.090> use<00:03:36.510> any<00:03:36.720> styling<00:03:37.260> other<00:03:37.440> than<00:03:37.650> a

00:03:37.670 --> 00:03:37.680 
didn't use any styling other than a
