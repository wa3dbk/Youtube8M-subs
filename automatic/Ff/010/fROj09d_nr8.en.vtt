00:00:06.010 --> 00:00:09.769
 Of course, he is one of the lucky ones 

00:00:08.090 --> 00:00:11.000
 start it up like you have the game 

00:00:09.769 --> 00:00:12.550
 seen that was already no lot 

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:14.690
 for weak nerves 

00:00:12.550 --> 00:00:15.740
 I think we have one against today 

00:00:14.690 --> 00:00:18.970
 good opponents played 

00:00:15.740 --> 00:00:21.859
 which have made a lot of pressure I think 

00:00:18.970 --> 00:00:24.169
 I came in quite well on the post 

00:00:21.859 --> 00:00:26.409
 shot from one to have but then clear 

00:00:24.169 --> 00:00:30.220
 some situation in which we are lucky 

00:00:26.409 --> 00:00:32.930
 Of course he was the 1 0 for us 

00:00:30.220 --> 00:00:36.530
 Can opener I think we have one 

00:00:32.930 --> 00:00:39.500
 some who have moral broken it 

00:00:36.530 --> 00:00:41.329
 even exciting once but on 

00:00:39.500 --> 00:00:43.879
 At the end we have the three points 

00:00:41.329 --> 00:00:45.410
 taken away and that the tent was for 

00:00:43.879 --> 00:00:49.760
 us high-intensity outdoors they come 

00:00:45.410 --> 00:00:52.190
 Imagine what was going on at the field very much 

00:00:49.760 --> 00:00:54.800
 good opponent everything inside fastness 

00:00:52.190 --> 00:00:58.969
 We will score in the basket for 

00:00:54.800 --> 00:01:02.329
 us eleven meters inside so we have 

00:00:58.969 --> 00:01:04.390
 several situations follow from where you get the 

00:01:02.329 --> 00:01:06.110
 Past performances do not pass properly 

00:01:04.390 --> 00:01:07.550
 otherwise you have more 

00:01:06.110 --> 00:01:09.320
 counterfeit body the rooms 

00:01:07.550 --> 00:01:10.690
 were there even if you from stuttgart 

00:01:09.320 --> 00:01:12.710
 played really well 

00:01:10.690 --> 00:01:16.670
 if you grant me what you say so 

00:01:12.710 --> 00:01:18.710
 far will we have look forward 

00:01:16.670 --> 00:01:20.360
 that's our offensive then 

00:01:18.710 --> 00:01:23.450
 also met 

00:01:20.360 --> 00:01:25.790
 So not for the faint nerves it was 

00:01:23.450 --> 00:01:27.560
 a real back and forth with the 

00:01:25.790 --> 00:01:30.170
 better chances for stuttgart we have 

00:01:27.560 --> 00:01:31.640
 very much better used by us 

00:01:30.170 --> 00:01:33.560
 he won with a little bit 

00:01:31.640 --> 00:01:35.180
 luck with it and with god sake but 

00:01:33.560 --> 00:01:36.500
 won is won and three points 

00:01:35.180 --> 00:01:38.570
 very important to start especially 

00:01:36.500 --> 00:01:39.890
 against such an extremely strong folder as 

00:01:38.570 --> 00:01:41.060
 today you are a bit too 

00:01:39.890 --> 00:01:44.290
 longer at the fc controlling 

00:01:41.060 --> 00:01:46.460
 to recall the victory in the Bundesliga 

00:01:44.290 --> 00:01:49.280
 i believe in my involvement 

00:01:46.460 --> 00:01:51.500
 but not every case 

00:01:49.280 --> 00:01:53.479
 yes, if only from the tribune 

00:01:51.500 --> 00:01:56.659
 but somehow , even there, you do not know 

00:01:53.479 --> 00:01:57.770
 What you can not do I know 

00:01:56.659 --> 00:02:00.640
 Do not remember me for so long 

00:01:57.770 --> 00:02:00.640
 probably already like it
