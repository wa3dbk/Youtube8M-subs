00:00:01.580 --> 00:00:06.000
 not everyone needs a highend 

00:00:03.389 --> 00:00:07.259
 smartphone that costs up to 600 euros 

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:09.570
 and that's why we have the 

00:00:07.259 --> 00:00:12.480
 the best smartphones the up to date 

00:00:09.570 --> 00:00:14.130
 150 euros or a few extra mark 

00:00:12.480 --> 00:00:17.160
 and the best five I put to you 

00:00:14.130 --> 00:00:18.600
 now before whoever this whole smartphone 

00:00:17.160 --> 00:00:20.310
 bells and whistles just do not need it 

00:00:18.600 --> 00:00:22.230
 whatsapp news occasionally writes 

00:00:20.310 --> 00:00:24.600
 surfing on facebook and maybe times 

00:00:22.230 --> 00:00:27.119
 Quiz plays duel can calm down to 

00:00:24.600 --> 00:00:29.130
 Motor grab the disadvantages 

00:00:27.119 --> 00:00:31.230
 It has a weak processor 

00:00:29.130 --> 00:00:34.469
 not quite as bright is 4 3 inch display 

00:00:31.230 --> 00:00:36.980
 has only 4 GB of internal memory there 

00:00:34.469 --> 00:00:39.450
 no camera flash and no front camera 

00:00:36.980 --> 00:00:41.610
 that's why the Moto II is at a price 

00:00:39.450 --> 00:00:43.920
 from under 100 euros and offers for the 

00:00:41.610 --> 00:00:45.030
 own music collection on a sd-slot 

00:00:43.920 --> 00:00:47.190
 an update for the current one 

00:00:45.030 --> 00:00:50.309
 android version lollipop is by the way 

00:00:47.190 --> 00:00:52.890
 also safe with a 5 inch hd display 

00:00:50.309 --> 00:00:55.559

00:00:52.890 --> 00:00:57.750
 Memory a sd slot and dual 

00:00:55.559 --> 00:01:00.570
 sim was mixed with his new one 

00:00:57.750 --> 00:01:03.420
 brand that without 3c position strong 

00:01:00.570 --> 00:01:06.390
 with the 2300 milliamp battery 

00:01:03.420 --> 00:01:08.760
 is likely the 140 euro cheap smartphone 

00:01:06.390 --> 00:01:10.740
 Ordinary terms also offer the 

00:01:08.760 --> 00:01:12.500
 but Android software is not on the 

00:01:10.740 --> 00:01:15.350
 latest version 

00:01:12.500 --> 00:01:18.050

 not exactly like a low budget 

00:01:24.890 --> 00:01:27.170
 device 

00:01:25.430 --> 00:01:28.630
 The internal memory is four 

00:01:27.170 --> 00:01:31.010
 gigabyte, however, very small 

00:01:28.630 --> 00:01:32.960
 For example, it quickly warms up and the 

00:01:31.010 --> 00:01:35.090
 software does not bring anything except camera 

00:01:32.960 --> 00:01:37.100

00:01:44.690 --> 00:01:52.670

 front camera as well as led lightning on the 

00:01:57.440 --> 00:02:00.619
 back and front selfish can 

00:01:59.660 --> 00:02:02.090
 So also in difficult 

00:02:00.619 --> 00:02:04.880
 be shot 

00:02:02.090 --> 00:02:07.399
 in addition there are two gb of working memory 16 

00:02:04.880 --> 00:02:09.350
 gb internal memory which also per 

00:02:07.399 --> 00:02:12.170
 Micro this is expandable there 

00:02:09.350 --> 00:02:14.150
 finally 1 1 7 ghz quad-core 

00:02:12.170 --> 00:02:16.790
 processor and a 2000 

00:02:14.150 --> 00:02:19.610
 milli- battery and the acer 

00:02:16.790 --> 00:02:20.959
 liquid e 3 plus ab additionally there is 

00:02:19.610 --> 00:02:22.519
 a handy button on the 

00:02:20.959 --> 00:02:23.959
 back which with various 

00:02:22.519 --> 00:02:26.330
 functions can be occupied 

00:02:23.959 --> 00:02:28.700
 it is not known how it is 

00:02:26.330 --> 00:02:30.500
 manages the update policy and the 

00:02:28.700 --> 00:02:31.360
 battery life should also not the 

00:02:30.500 --> 00:02:34.340
 be best 

00:02:31.360 --> 00:02:35.120
 the motogp is a handy smartphone 

00:02:34.340 --> 00:02:36.680
 with the best 

00:02:35.120 --> 00:02:37.190
 value for money in this 

00:02:36.680 --> 00:02:40.070
 round 

00:02:37.190 --> 00:02:42.560
 this version is indeed 169 euro 

00:02:40.070 --> 00:02:45.320
 slightly above the 150 set here 

00:02:42.560 --> 00:02:47.750
 euro frame with 4g and a 47 

00:02:45.320 --> 00:02:48.709
 inch hd amoled display we were able to 

00:02:47.750 --> 00:02:51.320
 just not different 

00:02:48.709 --> 00:02:53.180
 even today it is in july 2014 

00:02:51.320 --> 00:02:55.700
 presented the smartphone still 

00:02:53.180 --> 00:02:57.260
 top of the internal memory is 8 gb 

00:02:55.700 --> 00:02:59.540
 Although quite tight 

00:02:57.260 --> 00:03:01.820
 thanks to the sd card slot that should 

00:02:59.540 --> 00:03:03.620
 But no problem will be offered as well 

00:03:01.820 --> 00:03:06.950
 the motogp has a very good battery life 

00:03:03.620 --> 00:03:09.680
 and receives in the first quarter of 2015 the 

00:03:06.950 --> 00:03:11.840
 update on android lollipop the only one 

00:03:09.680 --> 00:03:13.940
 criticism of the motto that is the camera 

00:03:11.840 --> 00:03:16.800
 quality for simple snapshots 

00:03:13.940 --> 00:03:19.300
 but that should be enough 

00:03:16.800 --> 00:03:21.610
 which is a new top smartphone for 

00:03:19.300 --> 00:03:23.110
 up to 150 euros or a few mark more 

00:03:21.610 --> 00:03:25.600
 I'm just training a bit 

00:03:23.110 --> 00:03:27.610
 between the motogp and the acer 

00:03:25.600 --> 00:03:29.770
 know the update policy more 

00:03:27.610 --> 00:03:31.390
 but the camera would go to the biscuit 

00:03:29.770 --> 00:03:32.560
 at motogp you would have the two 

00:03:31.390 --> 00:03:34.630
 kinda mix that up a bit 

00:03:32.560 --> 00:03:36.490
 would be very cool if you wanted to vote 

00:03:34.630 --> 00:03:37.900
