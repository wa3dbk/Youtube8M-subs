00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.040
 One thing I know now dinosaurs go 

00:00:02.700 --> 00:00:06.029
 just like zombies can always be there 

00:00:05.040 --> 00:00:08.849
 you do not do anything wrong 

00:00:06.029 --> 00:00:10.860
 toy manufacturer dinosaurs can 

00:00:08.849 --> 00:00:13.200
 hardly resist that one 

00:00:10.860 --> 00:00:17.430
 Teeth and weapons shine on them and 

00:00:13.200 --> 00:00:18.840
 so hello assign a nonsense there 

00:00:17.430 --> 00:00:20.490
 will not be able to say against 

00:00:18.840 --> 00:00:23.990
 just as little as it is 

00:00:20.490 --> 00:00:26.099
 but the video is indeed already 

00:00:23.990 --> 00:00:27.420
 that's why it actually surprises 

00:00:26.099 --> 00:00:29.070
 not that even that 

00:00:27.420 --> 00:00:30.900
 time-honored she offers meanwhile 

00:00:29.070 --> 00:00:33.210
 the idea is a blend 

00:00:30.900 --> 00:00:36.870
 to and indeed and dinosaurs 

00:00:33.210 --> 00:00:38.129
 3d in the realm of the gigantic one perfect 

00:00:36.870 --> 00:00:40.170
 little unknown movie 

00:00:38.129 --> 00:00:42.059
 obviously have produced anyway 

00:00:40.170 --> 00:00:44.640
 something completely unknown but I am 

00:00:42.059 --> 00:00:46.890
 actually not that interesting 

00:00:44.640 --> 00:00:48.930
 in any movies that 

00:00:46.890 --> 00:00:50.010
 claims for documentation become 

00:00:48.930 --> 00:00:51.059
 to go to the cinema tomorrow 

00:00:50.010 --> 00:00:54.870
 that exists in public law 

00:00:51.059 --> 00:00:57.870
 TV truly enough he sees one 

00:00:54.870 --> 00:01:00.809
 mini dinosaur and collector cards 

00:00:57.870 --> 00:01:05.129
 crew and naked there thank you yes how 

00:01:00.809 --> 00:01:08.220
 said it is a totally reputable blind 

00:01:05.129 --> 00:01:10.110
 beck there is no cheap online gambling 

00:01:08.220 --> 00:01:12.720
 that is the personally from the bbc 

00:01:10.110 --> 00:01:14.880
 Apart from that , he also had the logo on it 

00:01:12.720 --> 00:01:19.380
 Clearly it is produced and how bitter 

00:01:14.880 --> 00:01:21.810
 But it's 100 percent official 

00:01:19.380 --> 00:01:23.130
 and the dinosaur be the andritz 

00:01:21.810 --> 00:01:25.590
 they should be really complicated 

00:01:23.130 --> 00:01:27.630
 but you almost want to think they are 

00:01:25.590 --> 00:01:30.090
 copied from the film on the remains 

00:01:27.630 --> 00:01:32.009
 is back draufgepackt because that valve 

00:01:30.090 --> 00:01:33.780
 as a plastic figure probably at the end 

00:01:32.009 --> 00:01:36.329
 do not look that is a pity 

00:01:33.780 --> 00:01:37.829
 the twelve pieces and there is a lot 

00:01:36.329 --> 00:01:39.720
 warnings how we do not want now 

00:01:37.829 --> 00:01:43.100
 Continue to note the warning before the lion 

00:01:39.720 --> 00:01:45.899
 I mean, look in 

00:01:43.100 --> 00:01:51.329
 what leads and pronounces the dinosaurs 

00:01:45.899 --> 00:01:52.590
 we first see the collectible motto 

00:01:51.329 --> 00:01:55.950
 you do not say that looking for it 

00:01:52.590 --> 00:02:03.299
 weighs four tons twelve meters long and 

00:01:55.950 --> 00:02:04.909
 is as fast as a motor yes there is 

00:02:03.299 --> 00:02:09.450
 he yes 

00:02:04.909 --> 00:02:12.150
 wait a minute who is that? 

00:02:09.450 --> 00:02:14.549
 with very complete 

00:02:12.150 --> 00:02:16.939
 a lot of fantasy can be recognized 

00:02:14.549 --> 00:02:19.650
 but his trade strange 

00:02:16.939 --> 00:02:21.599
 crippled out as if they were somehow even 

00:02:19.650 --> 00:02:22.110
 nothing to do with the packaging 

00:02:21.599 --> 00:02:24.840
 could 

00:02:22.110 --> 00:02:26.970
 that's too bad who would have expected that 

00:02:24.840 --> 00:02:29.069
 otherwise he has a number on the 

00:02:26.970 --> 00:02:32.189
 tail the basis was also not 

00:02:29.069 --> 00:02:34.079
 usually no longer safe and sees 

00:02:32.189 --> 00:02:35.489
 strange you do not just have one 

00:02:34.079 --> 00:02:36.900
 number eyes tail still exists 

00:02:35.489 --> 00:02:38.010
 probably decide on it 

00:02:36.900 --> 00:02:41.040
 I can not see it exactly 

00:02:38.010 --> 00:02:43.409
 but something stands there he stands then 

00:02:41.040 --> 00:02:46.769
 also with effort 

00:02:43.409 --> 00:02:48.299
 Well, there's nothing in here yet 

00:02:46.769 --> 00:02:51.359
 sometimes a booklet which details us 

00:02:48.299 --> 00:02:53.459
 explains which 12 or eleven others 

00:02:51.359 --> 00:02:54.120
 dinosaurs can still buy this 

00:02:53.459 --> 00:02:57.000
 it's a pity 

00:02:54.120 --> 00:02:58.829
 so you do not make money in the bbc but 

00:02:57.000 --> 00:03:01.019
 It looks particularly serious that you have 

00:02:58.829 --> 00:03:03.090
 anyway, not the collector card is like that 

00:03:01.019 --> 00:03:04.349
 linked as everyone else would have been 

00:03:03.090 --> 00:03:05.970
 you might better solve each other 

00:03:04.349 --> 00:03:09.329
 maybe not again 

00:03:05.970 --> 00:03:10.470
 but to this funny bird ago 

00:03:09.329 --> 00:03:13.310
 I do not want to try him 

00:03:10.470 --> 00:03:15.599
 to pronounce it something Latin 

00:03:13.310 --> 00:03:20.359
 peroni kiss no longer strong new 

00:03:15.599 --> 00:03:23.760
 yes, it is only 1.9 kilo heavy 

00:03:20.359 --> 00:03:26.690
 now bends for centimeters long as whole 

00:03:23.760 --> 00:03:29.790
 clearly recognizable is not true 

00:03:26.690 --> 00:03:30.180
 that's not quite true to scale 

00:03:29.790 --> 00:03:32.400
 just 

00:03:30.180 --> 00:03:33.900
 I never expected that, after all 

00:03:32.400 --> 00:03:35.639
 We already know that from the BBC 

00:03:33.900 --> 00:03:37.859
 dinosaurs now have game guides 

00:03:35.639 --> 00:03:41.659
 made or and this one is always 

00:03:37.859 --> 00:03:47.489
 worse in its quality 

00:03:41.659 --> 00:03:50.639
 compare as always a useful one 

00:03:47.489 --> 00:03:52.680
 to look out of the process and of course 

00:03:50.639 --> 00:03:54.500
 a cheap fun with a number on it 

00:03:52.680 --> 00:03:59.340
 who would have expected that 

00:03:54.500 --> 00:04:02.790
 I do not know so no I know 

00:03:59.340 --> 00:04:04.859
 exactly which is cheaper rip off as 

00:04:02.790 --> 00:04:08.310
 not to be expected otherwise was itself 

00:04:04.859 --> 00:04:11.159
 from the bbc yes, dear dinosaurs too 

00:04:08.310 --> 00:04:12.840
 In 2014 you will live on in ours 

00:04:11.159 --> 00:04:16.109
 learn the hearts of our toys and in 

00:04:12.840 --> 00:04:18.859
 our country becks but somehow 

00:04:16.109 --> 00:04:22.169
 then we are almost completely utopian 

00:04:18.859 --> 00:04:23.430
 Predators something else in catfish rather there 

00:04:22.169 --> 00:04:24.450
 at least you know what you get for a 

00:04:23.430 --> 00:04:26.400
 gets scrap 

00:04:24.450 --> 00:04:29.130
 but at the bbc you should be a bit 

00:04:26.400 --> 00:04:31.410
 But you can expect more 

00:04:29.130 --> 00:04:34.130
 obviously not that regrettable 

00:04:31.410 --> 00:04:34.130
 next time bye
