there<00:02:03.240> unfortunately<00:02:03.570> I<00:02:04.500> don't<00:02:04.619> happen<00:02:05.040> to

00:02:05.240 --> 00:02:05.250 
there unfortunately I don't happen to

00:02:05.250 --> 00:02:07.069 
there unfortunately I don't happen to
have<00:02:05.280> a<00:02:05.460> complete<00:02:06.090> set<00:02:06.420> of<00:02:06.450> these<00:02:06.750> things

00:02:07.069 --> 00:02:07.079 
have a complete set of these things

00:02:07.079 --> 00:02:08.950 
have a complete set of these things
strangely<00:02:07.920> enough

00:02:08.950 --> 00:02:08.960 
strangely enough

00:02:08.960 --> 00:02:11.540 
strangely enough
because<00:02:09.960> there's<00:02:10.170> like<00:02:10.320> nine<00:02:10.710> of<00:02:11.040> them<00:02:11.310> and

00:02:11.540 --> 00:02:11.550 
because there's like nine of them and

00:02:11.550 --> 00:02:13.760 
because there's like nine of them and
disappointingly<00:02:12.480> actually<00:02:12.990> why<00:02:13.500> are<00:02:13.560> there

00:02:13.760 --> 00:02:13.770 
disappointingly actually why are there

00:02:13.770 --> 00:02:15.650 
disappointingly actually why are there
nine<00:02:13.950> and<00:02:14.220> not<00:02:14.310> eight<00:02:14.490> this<00:02:15.180> is<00:02:15.240> annoying

00:02:15.650 --> 00:02:15.660 
nine and not eight this is annoying

00:02:15.660 --> 00:02:17.780 
nine and not eight this is annoying
because<00:02:15.990> Lego<00:02:16.560> do<00:02:16.740> real<00:02:16.950> ice<00:02:17.130> collectors

00:02:17.780 --> 00:02:17.790 
because Lego do real ice collectors

00:02:17.790 --> 00:02:20.570 
because Lego do real ice collectors
boxes<00:02:18.660> for<00:02:18.960> displaying<00:02:19.440> their<00:02:19.920> minifigures

00:02:20.570 --> 00:02:20.580 
boxes for displaying their minifigures

00:02:20.580 --> 00:02:22.760 
boxes for displaying their minifigures
that<00:02:20.730> you<00:02:20.850> can<00:02:21.030> collect<00:02:21.390> and<00:02:21.780> they<00:02:22.470> only<00:02:22.650> do

00:02:22.760 --> 00:02:22.770 
that you can collect and they only do

00:02:22.770 --> 00:02:25.640 
that you can collect and they only do
them<00:02:22.920> in<00:02:23.130> four<00:02:23.490> eight<00:02:23.760> and<00:02:24.090> sixteen<00:02:24.720> not<00:02:25.230> nine

00:02:25.640 --> 00:02:25.650 
them in four eight and sixteen not nine

00:02:25.650 --> 00:02:28.040 
them in four eight and sixteen not nine
so<00:02:26.070> we'd<00:02:26.160> have<00:02:26.280> like<00:02:26.430> one<00:02:26.700> left<00:02:27.000> over<00:02:27.240> anyway

00:02:28.040 --> 00:02:28.050
