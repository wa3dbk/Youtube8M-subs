hood<00:00:18.720> church<00:00:18.960> looks<00:00:19.949> a<00:00:20.100> little<00:00:20.250> bit<00:00:20.430> different

00:00:20.750 --> 00:00:20.760 
hood church looks a little bit different

00:00:20.760 --> 00:00:23.269 
hood church looks a little bit different
on<00:00:20.820> the<00:00:20.939> front<00:00:21.210> end<00:00:21.449> size-wise<00:00:22.289> still<00:00:23.160> the

00:00:23.269 --> 00:00:23.279 
on the front end size-wise still the

00:00:23.279 --> 00:00:25.130 
on the front end size-wise still the
same<00:00:23.430> forester<00:00:24.060> it's<00:00:24.330> got<00:00:24.570> this<00:00:24.720> slightly

00:00:25.130 --> 00:00:25.140 
same forester it's got this slightly

00:00:25.140 --> 00:00:27.259 
same forester it's got this slightly
bigger<00:00:25.529> so<00:00:26.250> the<00:00:26.369> wheelbase<00:00:26.760> is<00:00:26.820> going<00:00:27.119> to<00:00:27.180> be

00:00:27.259 --> 00:00:27.269 
bigger so the wheelbase is going to be

00:00:27.269 --> 00:00:29.929 
bigger so the wheelbase is going to be
about<00:00:27.359> point<00:00:27.810> nine<00:00:28.019> inches<00:00:28.320> longer<00:00:28.590> about<00:00:29.310> 16

00:00:29.929 --> 00:00:29.939 
about point nine inches longer about 16

00:00:29.939 --> 00:00:32.720 
about point nine inches longer about 16
inches<00:00:30.060> wider<00:00:30.920> feels<00:00:31.920> like<00:00:32.160> the<00:00:32.279> same<00:00:32.460> force

00:00:32.720 --> 00:00:32.730 
inches wider feels like the same force

00:00:32.730 --> 00:00:34.010 
inches wider feels like the same force
for<00:00:33.030> me<00:00:33.120> but<00:00:33.270> you're<00:00:33.360> going<00:00:33.450> to<00:00:33.540> get<00:00:33.630> lot<00:00:33.840> more

00:00:34.010 --> 00:00:34.020 
for me but you're going to get lot more

00:00:34.020 --> 00:00:41.060 
for me but you're going to get lot more
space<00:00:34.290> on<00:00:34.469> the<00:00:34.620> inside<00:00:34.730> now<00:00:38.780> use<00:00:39.780> treat<00:00:40.110> the

00:00:41.060 --> 00:00:41.070 
space on the inside now use treat the

00:00:41.070 --> 00:00:42.799 
space on the inside now use treat the
mirror<00:00:41.340> was<00:00:41.520> up<00:00:41.670> here<00:00:41.850> on<00:00:41.940> the<00:00:42.030> door<00:00:42.239> they've

00:00:42.799 --> 00:00:42.809 
mirror was up here on the door they've

00:00:42.809 --> 00:00:45.020 
mirror was up here on the door they've
moved<00:00:43.140> it<00:00:43.379> down<00:00:43.410> here<00:00:43.980> giving<00:00:44.640> me<00:00:44.700> a<00:00:44.730> little

00:00:45.020 --> 00:00:45.030 
moved it down here giving me a little

00:00:45.030 --> 00:00:46.670 
moved it down here giving me a little
window<00:00:45.270> out<00:00:45.420> the<00:00:45.600> front<00:00:45.870> so<00:00:46.079> you<00:00:46.110> get<00:00:46.350> a<00:00:46.379> lot

00:00:46.670 --> 00:00:46.680 
window out the front so you get a lot

00:00:46.680 --> 00:00:48.920 
window out the front so you get a lot
better<00:00:46.890> visibility<00:00:47.340> you<00:00:48.329> might<00:00:48.539> also<00:00:48.750> notice

00:00:48.920 --> 00:00:48.930 
better visibility you might also notice

00:00:48.930 --> 00:00:52.549 
better visibility you might also notice
the<00:00:49.760> window<00:00:50.760> is<00:00:51.090> slanted<00:00:51.930> back<00:00:52.110> a<00:00:52.140> little<00:00:52.410> bit

00:00:52.549 --> 00:00:52.559 
the window is slanted back a little bit

00:00:52.559 --> 00:00:54.500 
the window is slanted back a little bit
further<00:00:52.860> so<00:00:53.129> you<00:00:53.160> get<00:00:53.430> a<00:00:53.579> lot<00:00:53.820> more<00:00:53.850> visibility

00:00:54.500 --> 00:00:54.510 
further so you get a lot more visibility

00:00:54.510 --> 00:00:57.709 
further so you get a lot more visibility
out<00:00:54.840> the<00:00:54.989> front<00:00:55.199> of<00:00:55.289> the<00:00:55.350> car<00:00:55.590> they<00:00:56.309> also<00:00:56.719> have

00:00:57.709 --> 00:00:57.719 
out the front of the car they also have

00:00:57.719 --> 00:01:00.439 
out the front of the car they also have
thinned<00:00:58.649> the<00:00:58.770> b-pillar<00:00:59.309> and<00:00:59.670> turned<00:01:00.270> it<00:01:00.420> back

00:01:00.439 --> 00:01:00.449 
thinned the b-pillar and turned it back

00:01:00.449 --> 00:01:02.049 
thinned the b-pillar and turned it back
a<00:01:00.600> little<00:01:00.780> bit<00:01:01.109> so<00:01:01.350> you're<00:01:01.500> going<00:01:01.620> to<00:01:01.680> have

00:01:02.049 --> 00:01:02.059 
a little bit so you're going to have

00:01:02.059 --> 00:01:04.700 
a little bit so you're going to have
easier<00:01:03.059> access<00:01:03.090> getting<00:01:03.840> it<00:01:03.930> nmap<00:01:04.350> the<00:01:04.500> car

00:01:04.700 --> 00:01:04.710 
easier access getting it nmap the car

00:01:04.710 --> 00:01:06.590 
easier access getting it nmap the car

00:01:07.969 --> 00:01:07.979 
also can give you a little bit better

00:01:07.979 --> 00:01:09.800 
also can give you a little bit better
visibility<00:01:08.340> when<00:01:08.760> you<00:01:08.880> look<00:01:09.030> out<00:01:09.210> the<00:01:09.330> back<00:01:09.540> as

00:01:09.800 --> 00:01:09.810

well
and<00:01:11.159> a<00:01:11.190> few<00:01:11.460> more<00:01:11.580> changes<00:01:12.090> may<00:01:12.210> also<00:01:12.860> lowered

00:01:13.850 --> 00:01:13.860 
and a few more changes may also lowered
