00:00:04.310 --> 00:00:11.740
 It is production to the extent that it matched to the umbilical hole 

00:00:07.790 --> 00:00:15.710
 We plan thickness of member to make umbilical 

00:00:11.740 --> 00:00:19.580
 Next measure the width of the hole 

00:00:15.710 --> 00:00:23.000
 Subtracting the width of the hole from the thickness of the member 

00:00:19.580 --> 00:00:29.290
 The dimension of the unnecessary part comes out 

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:29.290
 Divide it by 2 to get the dimensions of the unnecessary part on one side 

00:00:31.340 --> 00:00:39.380
 Transfer the length of the ana to a member about 

00:00:35.910 --> 00:00:39.380
 I'll make a cut at that one 

00:00:52.680 --> 00:00:59.400
 Calculated the thickness of the spacer earlier 

00:00:55.980 --> 00:01:03.410
 According to the size of unnecessary parts on one side 

00:00:59.400 --> 00:01:03.410
 Insert behind the front plate 

00:01:08.370 --> 00:01:13.460
 Clamp the member with the saw blade spacer 

00:01:23.740 --> 00:01:30.790
 This saw is also without clam 

00:01:27.440 --> 00:01:30.790
 Cut to the ink line 

00:01:58.210 --> 00:02:07.340
 A cut has been made in the cultural place 

00:02:01.560 --> 00:02:07.340
 Cut out the Noodles around the umbilical with a right angle guide 

00:02:49.590 --> 00:02:55.610
 It is just good meshing 

00:02:52.610 --> 00:02:59.620
 Match the semi-circular dog at both ends of the hole 

00:02:55.610 --> 00:02:59.620
 The tip is also molded with a cutter 

00:03:04.160 --> 00:03:09.880
 After this we will introduce hozo drilling using a drilling machine 

00:03:11.180 --> 00:03:19.269
 The next policy is to open the door ahead 

00:03:14.930 --> 00:03:19.269
 Umbilical is processed according to the umbilical hole 

00:03:20.520 --> 00:03:27.170
 Mark the center of the thickness of the wood in your own center finder 

00:03:42.030 --> 00:03:48.170
 Fix the hole processing jig on the work table of drilling machine 

00:03:53.640 --> 00:04:00.670
 It is a bit used for hozo processing 

00:03:56.580 --> 00:04:04.830
 Perseverance of the center finder from the right 

00:04:00.670 --> 00:04:08.850
 Spiral bit used in routers and trimmers 

00:04:04.830 --> 00:04:15.090
 A drill bit with a hunt on the tip 

00:04:08.850 --> 00:04:17.480
 With the longest among the three to determine the distance of the first from time to drill chuck 

00:04:15.090 --> 00:04:23.150
 Determine the distance 

00:04:17.480 --> 00:04:23.960
 In this way, it is not necessary to adjust the worktable to the length of the bit and move it up and down each time. 

00:04:23.150 --> 00:04:31.060
 so 

00:04:23.960 --> 00:04:31.060
 Even if the bit is replaced, accurate machining can be performed without shifting the center. 

00:04:32.750 --> 00:04:39.400
 Then change to the center finder's stem 

00:04:35.810 --> 00:04:39.400
 Align to the center of the event 

00:04:44.270 --> 00:04:49.270
 Change to the drill bit where the center was 

00:04:50.600 --> 00:04:55.300
 Open the hole after the depth setting 

00:04:59.009 --> 00:05:06.139
 First make a hole at both ends of the hole 

00:05:01.969 --> 00:05:10.599
 Then open to b market 

00:05:06.139 --> 00:05:10.599
 Let's make a hole while discharging chips 

00:05:51.340 --> 00:05:59.409
 Then open the hole to connect the hole 

00:05:54.860 --> 00:06:03.729
 This work opened the hole and fixed temporarily agent 

00:05:59.409 --> 00:06:10.949
 As it is released and you repeat work to shift system position 

00:06:03.729 --> 00:06:10.949
 It is very useful to have a hole drilling jig that can do both in an instant 

00:06:22.300 --> 00:06:31.289
 Chips are being sucked into the prisoner port more and more 

00:06:25.870 --> 00:06:34.409
 The tip of the bit looks good and positioning can be facilitated 

00:06:31.289 --> 00:06:39.449
 If the surface without holes is flat to some extent 

00:06:34.409 --> 00:06:46.159
 We will continue to 180-degree turn over the work to an agent 

00:06:39.449 --> 00:06:46.159
 In this way, the hollow hole will open exactly at the center of the case 

00:06:52.870 --> 00:06:58.560
 If the inside is clean, this is the end of the hole 

00:07:01.590 --> 00:07:07.880
 There is also a way to use a spiral bit to clean the inner surface 

00:07:22.940 --> 00:07:28.810
 Repeat this process to flatten the inside of Ozawa
