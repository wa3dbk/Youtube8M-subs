00:03:48.309 --> 00:03:48.319 
when I first cut it like this I

00:03:48.319 --> 00:03:50.710 
when I first cut it like this I
completely<00:03:48.829> ruined<00:03:49.130> it<00:03:49.400> but<00:03:49.669> that<00:03:50.450> was<00:03:50.569> all

00:03:50.710 --> 00:03:50.720 
completely ruined it but that was all

00:03:50.720 --> 00:03:55.559 
completely ruined it but that was all
the<00:03:50.810> way<00:03:50.870> back<00:03:50.900> when<00:03:51.410> I<00:03:51.440> was<00:03:51.650> around<00:03:51.859> 13<00:03:53.560> so<00:03:54.560> I

00:03:55.559 --> 00:03:55.569 
the way back when I was around 13 so I

00:03:55.569 --> 00:03:59.530 
the way back when I was around 13 so I
completely<00:03:56.569> totaled<00:03:57.260> it<00:03:57.349> and<00:03:58.010> I<00:03:58.480> kept<00:03:59.480> a

00:03:59.530 --> 00:03:59.540 
completely totaled it and I kept a

00:03:59.540 --> 00:04:02.229 
completely totaled it and I kept a
complete<00:03:59.870> wreck<00:04:00.139> but<00:04:00.639> it's<00:04:01.639> growing<00:04:01.879> out<00:04:02.000> and

00:04:02.229 --> 00:04:02.239 
complete wreck but it's growing out and

00:04:02.239 --> 00:04:05.080 
complete wreck but it's growing out and
I've<00:04:02.359> learned<00:04:02.599> how<00:04:02.690> to<00:04:02.780> cut<00:04:03.049> it<00:04:03.079> better<00:04:03.319> so<00:04:04.090> it

00:04:05.080 --> 00:04:05.090 
I've learned how to cut it better so it

00:04:05.090 --> 00:04:07.330 
I've learned how to cut it better so it
turned<00:04:05.269> out<00:04:05.389> to<00:04:05.540> be<00:04:05.660> like<00:04:05.870> this<00:04:06.079> you<00:04:06.440> pretty

00:04:07.330 --> 00:04:07.340 
turned out to be like this you pretty

00:04:07.340 --> 00:04:09.520 
turned out to be like this you pretty
much<00:04:07.579> just<00:04:07.790> do<00:04:08.000> the<00:04:08.120> same<00:04:08.329> with<00:04:08.510> this<00:04:08.660> side<00:04:08.720> as

00:04:09.520 --> 00:04:09.530 
much just do the same with this side as

00:04:09.530 --> 00:04:11.319 
much just do the same with this side as
you<00:04:09.949> can<00:04:10.069> see<00:04:10.220> I<00:04:10.250> have<00:04:10.430> little<00:04:10.639> layers<00:04:10.879> on<00:04:11.209> the

00:04:11.319 --> 00:04:11.329 
you can see I have little layers on the

00:04:11.329 --> 00:04:13.869 
you can see I have little layers on the
top<00:04:11.359> as<00:04:11.750> well<00:04:11.949> just<00:04:12.949> cut<00:04:13.129> that<00:04:13.280> one<00:04:13.459> something

00:04:13.869 --> 00:04:13.879 
top as well just cut that one something

00:04:13.879 --> 00:04:19.360 
top as well just cut that one something
we<00:04:13.970> just<00:04:14.410> layer<00:04:15.410> it<00:04:15.650> up<00:04:17.560> yeah<00:04:18.560> that's<00:04:19.190> all<00:04:19.310> you

00:04:19.360 --> 00:04:19.370 
we just layer it up yeah that's all you

00:04:19.370 --> 00:04:21.430 
we just layer it up yeah that's all you
do<00:04:19.549> is<00:04:19.639> pretty<00:04:19.789> much<00:04:19.970> just<00:04:20.180> cut<00:04:20.389> little<00:04:20.539> top

00:04:21.430 --> 00:04:21.440 
do is pretty much just cut little top

00:04:21.440 --> 00:04:23.920 
do is pretty much just cut little top
layers<00:04:21.709> of<00:04:21.919> your<00:04:22.010> hair<00:04:22.250> it's<00:04:23.240> in<00:04:23.479> the<00:04:23.630> bottom

00:04:23.920 --> 00:04:23.930 
layers of your hair it's in the bottom

00:04:23.930 --> 00:04:26.500 
layers of your hair it's in the bottom
out<00:04:24.050> a<00:04:24.080> little<00:04:24.320> bit<00:04:24.590> so<00:04:24.830> it's<00:04:25.310> very<00:04:25.490> thin<00:04:25.849> as

00:04:26.500 --> 00:04:26.510 
out a little bit so it's very thin as

00:04:26.510 --> 00:04:29.740 
out a little bit so it's very thin as
you<00:04:26.570> can<00:04:26.630> see<00:04:27.550> my<00:04:28.550> hair<00:04:28.669> is<00:04:28.699> naturally<00:04:29.180> thin<00:04:29.389> so

00:04:29.740 --> 00:04:29.750 
you can see my hair is naturally thin so

00:04:29.750 --> 00:04:32.680 
you can see my hair is naturally thin so
I<00:04:29.990> guess<00:04:30.229> that's<00:04:30.380> how<00:04:30.530> it<00:04:30.620> worked<00:04:30.770> out<00:04:31.570> one<00:04:32.570> day

00:04:32.680 --> 00:04:32.690 
I guess that's how it worked out one day

00:04:32.690 --> 00:04:34.210 
I guess that's how it worked out one day
I<00:04:32.720> just<00:04:32.810> randomly<00:04:33.169> thought<00:04:33.560> about<00:04:33.770> cutting<00:04:34.010> my

00:04:34.210 --> 00:04:34.220 
I just randomly thought about cutting my

00:04:34.220 --> 00:04:36.580 
I just randomly thought about cutting my
hair<00:04:34.430> like<00:04:35.060> this<00:04:35.090> and<00:04:35.660> dyeing<00:04:35.960> it<00:04:36.169> like<00:04:36.320> this

00:04:36.580 --> 00:04:36.590 
hair like this and dyeing it like this

00:04:36.590 --> 00:04:39.279 
hair like this and dyeing it like this
because<00:04:37.430> I<00:04:37.520> just<00:04:37.639> wanted<00:04:37.880> to<00:04:37.970> be<00:04:38.120> out<00:04:39.080> of

00:04:39.279 --> 00:04:39.289 
because I just wanted to be out of

00:04:39.289 --> 00:04:40.990 
because I just wanted to be out of
ordinary<00:04:39.620> and<00:04:39.919> stand<00:04:40.310> out<00:04:40.520> and<00:04:40.820> I<00:04:40.970> just

00:04:40.990 --> 00:04:41.000 
ordinary and stand out and I just

00:04:41.000 --> 00:04:43.150 
ordinary and stand out and I just
thought<00:04:41.300> about<00:04:41.330> dyeing<00:04:41.840> my<00:04:42.020> hair<00:04:42.050> into<00:04:42.500> three

00:04:43.150 --> 00:04:43.160 
thought about dyeing my hair into three

00:04:43.160 --> 00:04:46.480 
thought about dyeing my hair into three
different<00:04:43.310> colors<00:04:43.789> one<00:04:44.539> purple<00:04:44.960> blue<00:04:45.490> pink

as<00:05:09.090> well<00:05:09.270> because<00:05:10.110> she<00:05:10.140> thought<00:05:10.320> it<00:05:10.380> was<00:05:10.590> cool

00:05:10.790 --> 00:05:10.800 
as well because she thought it was cool

00:05:10.800 --> 00:05:12.680

00:05:14.480 --> 00:05:14.490 
there like this would be but that's a
