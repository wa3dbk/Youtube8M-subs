00:00:00.160 --> 00:00:04.899
 well anyway he still did not live well 

00:00:02.740 --> 00:00:08.349
 it seems that gta rockstar are still 

00:00:04.899 --> 00:00:11.530
 breaking many records this time 

00:00:08.349 --> 00:00:14.049
 already good they have sold a lot in play 3 

00:00:11.530 --> 00:00:16.420
 I have 360 ​​companies are 4 have also 

00:00:14.049 --> 00:00:18.279
 beat records in xbox man also and 

00:00:16.420 --> 00:00:20.619
 well, it seems that I started because I was not going 

00:00:18.279 --> 00:00:23.070
 to be otherwise it seems that gta 5 

00:00:20.619 --> 00:00:25.420
 could have sold a million 

00:00:23.070 --> 00:00:26.830
 units and then I could because still 

00:00:25.420 --> 00:00:30.130
 is team has not confirmed it but good 

00:00:26.830 --> 00:00:32.890
 gametop sourcestop and with spy or 

00:00:30.130 --> 00:00:37.200
 how do you want to pronounce it? 

00:00:32.890 --> 00:00:39.460
 pretty win gamespy silly is team spain 

00:00:37.200 --> 00:00:41.920
 which is a pretty reliable good source 

00:00:39.460 --> 00:00:43.750
 always gives data and steam 

00:00:41.920 --> 00:00:46.230
 and so on so good basically and 

00:00:43.750 --> 00:00:48.780
 it would not seem like a pretty thing either 

00:00:46.230 --> 00:00:50.920
 so strange not because something to say 

00:00:48.780 --> 00:00:52.809
 but it is quite scary a 

00:00:50.920 --> 00:00:55.120
 million copies in a single day is the 

00:00:52.809 --> 00:00:58.239
 c's fine chick that's 

00:00:55.120 --> 00:00:59.410
 completely true steam in steam 

00:00:58.239 --> 00:01:00.699
 we are talking, that is, we are not 

00:00:59.410 --> 00:01:03.640
 talking about the physical copies too 

00:01:00.699 --> 00:01:05.680
 that there will obviously not be many to your 

00:01:03.640 --> 00:01:06.970
 seven points dvds and others and good the 

00:01:05.680 --> 00:01:10.720
 people prefer the compressor 

00:01:06.970 --> 00:01:13.300
 and having it there and point point is a figure 

00:01:10.720 --> 00:01:16.450
 very high is a figure very very very very 

00:01:13.300 --> 00:01:18.190
 very high and the truth is that good 

00:01:16.450 --> 00:01:21.670
 It's worth it, it's worth it 

00:01:18.190 --> 00:01:23.710
 true and good also estime was 

00:01:21.670 --> 00:01:25.720
 there who wanted the euro is the 

00:01:23.710 --> 00:01:27.880
 I gave it back to others for the 

00:01:25.720 --> 00:01:29.020
 failures that was causing and in addition 

00:01:27.880 --> 00:01:30.880
 some people I did not have any 

00:01:29.020 --> 00:01:32.320
 problem just that to begin with 

00:01:30.880 --> 00:01:34.210
 by itself I had to wait quite a lot 

00:01:32.320 --> 00:01:36.220
 but obviously it's normal there was a lot 

00:01:34.210 --> 00:01:37.840
 people unloading the patch and others I 

00:01:36.220 --> 00:01:39.520
 tomorrow I will have to bring some video 

00:01:37.840 --> 00:01:43.869
 for now with the computer that I have the 

00:01:39.520 --> 00:01:46.360
 gtx 668 of ram and little more a 7 and others 

00:01:43.869 --> 00:01:48.430
 Well multiplayer is not going very well 

00:01:46.360 --> 00:01:50.710
 hit a few pulls of those of the most 

00:01:48.430 --> 00:01:52.960
 handsome is true that yes it is true 

00:01:50.710 --> 00:01:55.150
 so good tomorrow I'll have a 

00:01:52.960 --> 00:01:57.490
 960 and so on I imagine and another 

00:01:55.150 --> 00:01:59.200
 pilot more than ram then look fluid and 

00:01:57.490 --> 00:02:02.140
 others online and I'll be able to upload some 

00:01:59.200 --> 00:02:03.430
 games with elias and others so good 

00:02:02.140 --> 00:02:05.500
 because tomorrow you will have the odd 

00:02:03.430 --> 00:02:07.150
 employment and touch deadly kombat by the way 

00:02:05.500 --> 00:02:08.500
