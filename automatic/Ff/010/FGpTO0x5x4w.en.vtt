00:00:06.020 --> 00:00:11.719
 to achieve activate the v-game channel 

00:00:08.630 --> 00:00:13.490
 let's explain how to activate and how 

00:00:11.719 --> 00:00:15.049
 download a video game from an account 

00:00:13.490 --> 00:00:18.080
 primary or primary that you have bought 

00:00:15.049 --> 00:00:20.390
 from our dotcom website we go 

00:00:18.080 --> 00:00:22.100
 to feed we will leave bs 4 

00:00:20.390 --> 00:00:24.640
 this is if we are in our profile 

00:00:22.100 --> 00:00:27.340
 personal voucher 

00:00:24.640 --> 00:00:29.980
 we get to where ps the most command there is a 

00:00:27.340 --> 00:00:32.590
 another profile and we throw a user we're going to 

00:00:29.980 --> 00:00:34.120
 have a user do not let him play with 

00:00:32.590 --> 00:00:36.460
 guests if we do not create a user of 

00:00:34.120 --> 00:00:37.860
 I agree we will accept we give 

00:00:36.460 --> 00:00:40.200
 following 

00:00:37.860 --> 00:00:42.740
 and then here we will put the email that 

00:00:40.200 --> 00:00:45.480
 We have sent you a ticket , either 

00:00:42.740 --> 00:00:48.540
 whatsapp either by email or by 

00:00:45.480 --> 00:00:52.410
 telephone contact as best agreement 

00:00:48.540 --> 00:00:55.410
 we have created a random account that 

00:00:52.410 --> 00:00:56.790
 call well subscribe to find 

00:00:55.410 --> 00:00:58.630
 a YouTube channel so you are 

00:00:56.790 --> 00:01:02.890
 seeing this 

00:00:58.630 --> 00:01:04.570
 that we have to steal the mail 

00:01:02.890 --> 00:01:06.690
 in this case we have used a credit account 

00:01:04.570 --> 00:01:06.690
 hotmail 

00:01:06.960 --> 00:01:12.659
 we have dotcom and then here 

00:01:10.260 --> 00:01:15.409
 we will enter the password or 

00:01:12.659 --> 00:01:15.409
 we call as 

00:01:17.950 --> 00:01:22.450
 in the email and password login 

00:01:20.350 --> 00:01:25.509
 it's important if we did not do session by 

00:01:22.450 --> 00:01:27.659
 psn but we will not see the game in our 

00:01:25.509 --> 00:01:27.659
 library 

00:01:27.720 --> 00:01:31.940
 we wait a moment 

00:01:29.570 --> 00:01:35.020
 normally to be a second account 

00:01:31.940 --> 00:01:37.250
 activation for your security 

00:01:35.020 --> 00:01:39.050
 indirectly, the station that is 

00:01:37.250 --> 00:01:40.670
 activated this system as main ps4 

00:01:39.050 --> 00:01:42.170
 we have to give him what if he does not 

00:01:40.670 --> 00:01:43.400
 we give that if the game we can not 

00:01:42.170 --> 00:01:45.670
 play it from our accounts 

00:01:43.400 --> 00:01:49.090
 personal vouchers we give you to activate 

00:01:45.670 --> 00:01:49.090
 we wait a moment 

00:01:49.330 --> 00:01:53.650
 and then it tells us that if adjustments and 

00:01:51.760 --> 00:01:55.150
 here in this case let's give it to omit 

00:01:53.650 --> 00:01:56.590
 we will never again go back to 

00:01:55.150 --> 00:02:00.930
 enter this account account do this 

00:01:56.590 --> 00:02:00.930
 use welcomes us v game 

00:02:01.240 --> 00:02:06.939
 we go directly to the library 

00:02:03.640 --> 00:02:08.530
 they come to the right of all work in 

00:02:06.939 --> 00:02:10.929
 library 

00:02:08.530 --> 00:02:13.709
 and here we see all the games that 

00:02:10.929 --> 00:02:17.140
 we have in all our accounts but 

00:02:13.709 --> 00:02:18.730
 we will see that without padlock the 

00:02:17.140 --> 00:02:21.580
 game that we have acquired in this case 

00:02:18.730 --> 00:02:23.680
 is asynchronous the Chinese in the case of 

00:02:21.580 --> 00:02:25.989
 widget will be widget after batman batman 

00:02:23.680 --> 00:02:28.569
 which we choose will be in that 

00:02:25.989 --> 00:02:33.370
 account we select we give to the 

00:02:28.569 --> 00:02:35.230
 X in the command and we will leave all the 

00:02:33.370 --> 00:02:37.110
 knee of this typical but we 

00:02:35.230 --> 00:02:39.550
 we will charge you to download 

00:02:37.110 --> 00:02:41.560
 we are only going to download it and the 

00:02:39.550 --> 00:02:43.780
 game will be added to downloads as well 

00:02:41.560 --> 00:02:45.550
 put up on the left if the game 

00:02:43.780 --> 00:02:47.380
 has more than one download ie 

00:02:45.550 --> 00:02:49.269
 have a few times when we give 

00:02:47.380 --> 00:02:50.680
 download you will have several options 

00:02:49.269 --> 00:02:52.510
 we select everything and we give 

00:02:50.680 --> 00:02:54.340
 download if any doubt we 

00:02:52.510 --> 00:02:58.269
 you ask but then simple you 

00:02:54.340 --> 00:02:59.890
 we give the circle once twice three times 

00:02:58.269 --> 00:03:01.560
 times and we have already appeared through the 

00:02:59.890 --> 00:03:04.600
 library what would be the next step 

00:03:01.560 --> 00:03:06.790
 next step would be to leave the user 

00:03:04.600 --> 00:03:09.220
 if we are not going to protect this account from 

00:03:06.790 --> 00:03:12.520
 a special way so we can not 

00:03:09.220 --> 00:03:15.950
 re-enter and leave the padlock 

00:03:12.520 --> 00:03:18.129
 we go to adjustments and in users 

00:03:15.950 --> 00:03:20.660
 we go to access settings up here 

00:03:18.129 --> 00:03:22.430
 we go downstairs in the management of 

00:03:20.660 --> 00:03:27.110
 keys and we create a generic key 

00:03:22.430 --> 00:03:29.090
 normally up up down down you 

00:03:27.110 --> 00:03:31.819
 we give again the arrows of the command 

00:03:29.090 --> 00:03:34.220
 up up down down and we have created 

00:03:31.819 --> 00:03:36.410
 a key what would be called pin for 

00:03:34.220 --> 00:03:38.120
 that nobody could by mistake enter the 

00:03:36.410 --> 00:03:41.480
 account we give you the circle several times 

00:03:38.120 --> 00:03:42.890
 and in adjustments again we would go to 

00:03:41.480 --> 00:03:45.830
 playstation network this is the last 

00:03:42.890 --> 00:03:47.840
 step one step 6 is more important in the 

00:03:45.830 --> 00:03:51.500
 which would we close session 

00:03:47.840 --> 00:03:54.680
 with this we avoid that they are and verify us 

00:03:51.500 --> 00:03:56.750
 the license in any case and always 

00:03:54.680 --> 00:03:59.810
 we will keep the game without any 

00:03:56.750 --> 00:04:00.920
 problem we are going to make the session and 

00:03:59.810 --> 00:04:02.800
 ready 

00:04:00.920 --> 00:04:04.630
 in the next step 

00:04:02.800 --> 00:04:06.110
 we would go up to the right in the 

00:04:04.630 --> 00:04:08.390
 feeding 

00:04:06.110 --> 00:04:10.640
 and we would give you another 34 option to follow 

00:04:08.390 --> 00:04:13.460
 would be to hold the ps button 

00:04:10.640 --> 00:04:17.860
 of the command and we will leave pc 4 

00:04:13.460 --> 00:04:17.860
 It's worth not to pay but leave the PC 4 

00:04:18.260 --> 00:04:25.170
 we wait a moment 

00:04:20.489 --> 00:04:28.170
 we go to where ps once simply 

00:04:25.170 --> 00:04:29.940
 we started our session with our 

00:04:28.170 --> 00:04:32.070
 user of always 

00:04:29.940 --> 00:04:33.980
 with any less user with whom 

00:04:32.070 --> 00:04:36.460
 We have acquired 

00:04:33.980 --> 00:04:38.230
 we go there 

00:04:36.460 --> 00:04:40.750
 my name 

00:04:38.230 --> 00:04:43.740
 it does not matter and we'll see what the game 

00:04:40.750 --> 00:04:47.260
 without padlock in a download process 

00:04:43.740 --> 00:04:48.160
 we can but go to this photo this 

00:04:47.260 --> 00:04:49.330
 icon is worth 

00:04:48.160 --> 00:04:51.310
 we can go up the left the 

00:04:49.330 --> 00:04:53.590
 notifications where we will see in the 

00:04:51.310 --> 00:04:55.090
 download section that the game is 

00:04:53.590 --> 00:04:57.670
 is downloading vale 

00:04:55.090 --> 00:05:01.550
 we have put him the pause we have not 

00:04:57.670 --> 00:05:03.410
 done and we leave it unloading 

00:05:01.550 --> 00:05:06.170
 the games are usually downloaded 

00:05:03.410 --> 00:05:07.760
 part that if we give the option button 

00:05:06.170 --> 00:05:09.420
 on top of the icon and we give 

00:05:07.760 --> 00:05:12.390
 information 

00:05:09.420 --> 00:05:16.410
 will tell us which one was unloaded 203 

00:05:12.390 --> 00:05:19.230
 megas of 3 144 in big games like 

00:05:16.410 --> 00:05:22.020
 they are for the last but man own battery 

00:05:19.230 --> 00:05:24.420
 widgets directly if we give you we have 

00:05:22.020 --> 00:05:25.260
 information and size downloads are 

00:05:24.420 --> 00:05:30.449
 30 gigas 

00:05:25.260 --> 00:05:33.930
 although in principle they put 6 in seconds 

00:05:30.449 --> 00:05:36.360
 flat is still downloading good is already 

00:05:33.930 --> 00:05:39.800
 we already have the game once it 

00:05:36.360 --> 00:05:43.110
 download let's go to x and let us play 

00:05:39.800 --> 00:05:46.020
 Any questions you ask us finally 

00:05:43.110 --> 00:05:47.909
 if we give food and change 

00:05:46.020 --> 00:05:50.129
 user if we try to enter the 

00:05:47.909 --> 00:05:52.830
 account by mistake let's see what happens 

00:05:50.129 --> 00:05:55.169
 he asks us for the password in agreement 

00:05:52.830 --> 00:05:57.509
 that as we will not do it to do 

00:05:55.169 --> 00:05:59.279
 we will accept the key is correct no 

00:05:57.509 --> 00:06:00.889
 we will enter the account so no 

00:05:59.279 --> 00:06:03.469
 Loose the padlock 

00:06:00.889 --> 00:06:05.300
 Any questions here we are greeting a 

00:06:03.469 --> 00:06:09.849
 hug and we wait for you in our page 

00:06:05.300 --> 00:06:09.849
 game together with a greeting
