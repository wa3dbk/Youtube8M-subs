00:00:46.990 --> 00:00:47.000 
great friends and saw that place like I

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:51.550 
great friends and saw that place like I
never<00:00:47.210> had<00:00:47.420> before<00:00:49.630> we<00:00:50.630> finished<00:00:51.020> up<00:00:51.140> in<00:00:51.320> Tahoe

00:00:51.550 --> 00:00:51.560 
never had before we finished up in Tahoe

00:00:51.560 --> 00:00:53.800 
never had before we finished up in Tahoe
and<00:00:51.740> we're<00:00:52.340> in<00:00:52.490> route<00:00:52.700> to<00:00:52.850> Colorado<00:00:53.330> and<00:00:53.510> then

00:00:53.800 --> 00:00:53.810 
and we're in route to Colorado and then

00:00:53.810 --> 00:00:55.660 
and we're in route to Colorado and then
we<00:00:53.930> realized<00:00:54.350> well<00:00:54.680> the<00:00:55.130> conditions<00:00:55.580> are

00:00:55.660 --> 00:00:55.670 
we realized well the conditions are

00:00:55.670 --> 00:00:58.060 
we realized well the conditions are
going<00:00:55.880> off<00:00:56.120> in<00:00:56.270> Utah<00:00:56.630> so<00:00:56.990> we<00:00:57.350> better<00:00:57.470> stop<00:00:57.830> off

00:00:58.060 --> 00:00:58.070 
going off in Utah so we better stop off

00:00:58.070 --> 00:01:00.070 
going off in Utah so we better stop off
and<00:00:58.340> that's<00:00:58.550> I<00:00:58.850> think<00:00:59.270> that's<00:00:59.570> when<00:00:59.750> I<00:00:59.780> really

00:01:00.070 --> 00:01:00.080 
and that's I think that's when I really

00:01:00.080 --> 00:01:02.080 
and that's I think that's when I really
realized<00:01:00.290> that<00:01:00.739> the<00:01:01.340> airstream<00:01:01.760> is<00:01:01.850> a<00:01:01.910> way<00:01:02.030> to

00:01:02.080 --> 00:01:02.090 
realized that the airstream is a way to

00:01:02.090 --> 00:01:06.970 
realized that the airstream is a way to
go<00:01:04.810> welcome<00:01:05.810> to<00:01:05.900> the<00:01:05.930> bunk<00:01:06.230> room<00:01:06.350> here<00:01:06.800> in<00:01:06.950> the
