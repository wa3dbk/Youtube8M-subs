 windowed mode so what do we need 

00:00:14.150 --> 00:00:18.320
 first we need to create a car well, not 

00:00:17.660 --> 00:00:21.529
 such 

00:00:18.320 --> 00:00:24.300
 where there is such a driver that 

00:00:21.529 --> 00:00:26.660
 with bad on 

00:00:24.300 --> 00:00:26.660

00:00:29.490 --> 00:00:32.470
 [music] 

00:00:31.030 --> 00:00:36.340
 An example of such here are usually on 

00:00:32.470 --> 00:00:41.020
 parking stands or somewhere else we do 

00:00:36.340 --> 00:00:43.770

00:00:55.180 --> 00:01:00.739
 point 4 

00:00:57.260 --> 00:01:04.309
 so what do we do next we go into 

00:01:00.739 --> 00:01:05.530
 map and look closest where 

00:01:04.309 --> 00:01:09.650
 we have 

00:01:05.530 --> 00:01:11.270
 car tuning car and so on where 

00:01:09.650 --> 00:01:16.130
 you can do to perhaps you know it 

00:01:11.270 --> 00:01:20.080

00:01:16.130 --> 00:01:20.080
 my neighbors are here so I will go there 

00:01:20.860 --> 00:01:26.060
 let's go there now 

00:01:22.520 --> 00:01:29.630
 and there I will tell you everything for hacking 

00:01:26.060 --> 00:01:33.429
 we will need 4 genes here i am 

00:01:29.630 --> 00:01:37.369
 correctly said but not so we 

00:01:33.429 --> 00:01:41.740
 we call right in there, he made 

00:01:37.369 --> 00:01:41.740
 for the car here he is inside 

00:01:48.210 --> 00:01:59.450
 now look at my 800,000 we are trying 

00:01:53.420 --> 00:02:02.250
 let's see we see the number 2380 enter it 

00:01:59.450 --> 00:02:04.049
 First we select the processor I hope everyone 

00:02:02.250 --> 00:02:06.960
 can use it choose 

00:02:04.049 --> 00:02:13.430
 processor gta 5 and gta 5 launcher ex and a 

00:02:06.960 --> 00:02:16.430
 gta 5 openable and enter 

00:02:13.430 --> 00:02:16.430
 2380 

00:02:17.050 --> 00:02:25.270
 Here we find a bunch just 

00:02:22.300 --> 00:02:28.290
 bullshit chic firms now we need 

00:02:25.270 --> 00:02:30.850
 put something on it. eg 

00:02:28.290 --> 00:02:32.070
 let's put the horn some well 

00:02:30.850 --> 00:02:36.220
 thousand in 10 

00:02:32.070 --> 00:02:40.060
 to change change car cost 

00:02:36.220 --> 00:02:44.350
 now the cost of the car is 7500 we enter 

00:02:40.060 --> 00:02:47.710
 click here next next scan you 

00:02:44.350 --> 00:02:51.760
 there must be a 19 thing 

00:02:47.710 --> 00:02:55.380
 there are 15 pieces now on 3 and a 

00:02:51.760 --> 00:02:58.570
 English we select all processes 

00:02:55.380 --> 00:03:02.370
 We throw them here and press again 

00:02:58.570 --> 00:03:05.980
 and choose you can choose only until 

00:03:02.370 --> 00:03:08.460
 999999 is the maximum meaning if you 

00:03:05.980 --> 00:03:13.510
 choose more then the game will fly away 

00:03:08.460 --> 00:03:15.640
 scary price for 99999 ducks choose 

00:03:13.510 --> 00:03:19.560
 go gta and see what we can 

00:03:15.640 --> 00:03:19.560
 sell 999999 

00:03:19.590 --> 00:03:26.230
 really sell type yes 

00:03:21.250 --> 00:03:31.600
 really sell the car we go out 

00:03:26.230 --> 00:03:35.440
 of this car and what we see and 199 999 

00:03:31.600 --> 00:03:38.110
 have been replenished about having a million 

00:03:35.440 --> 00:03:40.180
 seven hundred and ninety so you can do well not 

00:03:38.110 --> 00:03:42.580
 always of course when you can already sell 

00:03:40.180 --> 00:03:45.970
 vertex machines can be passed like 

00:03:42.580 --> 00:03:48.820
 once an hour or something like that but I think 

00:03:45.970 --> 00:03:51.270
 if you do it three times, that's enough 

00:03:48.820 --> 00:03:51.270
 it's a long time
