00:02:35.800 --> 00:02:35.810 
American I found that a very very

00:02:35.810 --> 00:02:40.090 
American I found that a very very
interesting<00:02:37.480> now<00:02:38.480> this<00:02:38.750> all<00:02:39.049> the<00:02:39.560> reason<00:02:39.920> they

00:02:40.090 --> 00:02:40.100 
interesting now this all the reason they

00:02:40.100 --> 00:02:43.240 
interesting now this all the reason they
changed<00:02:40.400> the<00:02:41.060> I<00:02:41.359> mean<00:02:42.109> I'm<00:02:42.530> assuming<00:02:42.769> this<00:02:43.130> is

00:02:43.240 --> 00:02:43.250 
changed the I mean I'm assuming this is

00:02:43.250 --> 00:02:44.620 
changed the I mean I'm assuming this is
the<00:02:43.310> reason<00:02:43.579> why<00:02:43.670> they<00:02:43.850> changed<00:02:44.209> the<00:02:44.299> malls<00:02:44.480> to

00:02:44.620 --> 00:02:44.630 
the reason why they changed the malls to

00:02:44.630 --> 00:02:45.819 
the reason why they changed the malls to
being<00:02:44.810> from<00:02:44.900> America<00:02:45.290> was<00:02:45.470> because<00:02:45.620> it<00:02:45.739> was

00:02:45.819 --> 00:02:45.829 
being from America was because it was

00:02:45.829 --> 00:02:48.250 
being from America was because it was
not<00:02:45.980> long<00:02:46.280> after<00:02:46.730> 9/11<00:02:46.970> so<00:02:47.870> I<00:02:47.900> don't<00:02:48.170> really

00:02:48.250 --> 00:02:48.260 
not long after 9/11 so I don't really

00:02:48.260 --> 00:02:50.410 
not long after 9/11 so I don't really
know<00:02:48.470> that<00:02:48.799> is<00:02:49.370> around<00:02:49.730> the<00:02:49.910> time<00:02:49.940> that<00:02:50.329> they

00:02:50.410 --> 00:02:50.420 
know that is around the time that they

00:02:50.420 --> 00:02:51.819 
know that is around the time that they
did<00:02:50.480> it<00:02:50.720> but<00:02:50.870> I<00:02:50.959> don't<00:02:51.019> really<00:02:51.200> know<00:02:51.440> why<00:02:51.650> they

00:02:51.819 --> 00:02:51.829 
did it but I don't really know why they

00:02:51.829 --> 00:02:53.500 
did it but I don't really know why they
actually<00:02:52.160> did<00:02:52.340> that<00:02:52.489> but<00:02:53.150> I<00:02:53.209> mean<00:02:53.359> this

00:02:53.500 --> 00:02:53.510 
actually did that but I mean this

00:02:53.510 --> 00:02:55.690 
actually did that but I mean this
certainly<00:02:53.780> demonstrates<00:02:54.440> one<00:02:55.190> of<00:02:55.220> the<00:02:55.400> really

00:02:55.690 --> 00:02:55.700 
certainly demonstrates one of the really

00:02:55.700 --> 00:02:58.180 
certainly demonstrates one of the really
great<00:02:55.880> arguments<00:02:56.660> against<00:02:56.959> nationalism<00:02:57.620> the

00:02:58.180 --> 00:02:58.190 
great arguments against nationalism the

00:02:58.190 --> 00:03:00.879 
great arguments against nationalism the
Brazilian<00:02:58.670> flag<00:02:58.880> like<00:02:59.750> every<00:03:00.230> flag<00:03:00.560> in<00:03:00.769> the

00:03:00.879 --> 00:03:00.889 
Brazilian flag like every flag in the

00:03:00.889 --> 00:03:03.729 
Brazilian flag like every flag in the
world<00:03:01.220> is<00:03:01.819> nothing<00:03:02.810> more<00:03:02.930> than<00:03:03.109> ten<00:03:03.349> cents

00:03:03.729 --> 00:03:03.739 
world is nothing more than ten cents

00:03:03.739 --> 00:03:05.650 
world is nothing more than ten cents
worth<00:03:03.889> of<00:03:04.010> Chinese<00:03:04.400> nylon<00:03:04.819> it<00:03:05.420> only

00:03:05.650 --> 00:03:05.660 
worth of Chinese nylon it only

00:03:05.660 --> 00:03:07.479 
worth of Chinese nylon it only
represents<00:03:06.230> a<00:03:06.290> government<00:03:06.739> and<00:03:06.889> a<00:03:06.950> fictional

00:03:07.479 --> 00:03:07.489 
represents a government and a fictional

00:03:07.489 --> 00:03:11.379 
represents a government and a fictional
line<00:03:08.030> drawn<00:03:08.599> on<00:03:08.780> a<00:03:08.810> map<00:03:08.870> it's<00:03:09.799> not<00:03:10.389> anything

00:03:11.379 --> 00:03:11.389 
line drawn on a map it's not anything

00:03:11.389 --> 00:03:13.210 
line drawn on a map it's not anything
real<00:03:11.900> countries<00:03:12.440> are<00:03:12.560> only<00:03:12.680> fictional

00:03:13.210 --> 00:03:13.220 
real countries are only fictional

real countries are only fictional
constructs<00:03:13.790> in<00:03:14.000> the<00:03:14.150> identity<00:03:14.660> plot<00:03:14.930> behind

00:03:15.159 --> 00:03:15.169 
constructs in the identity plot behind

00:03:15.169 --> 00:03:19.390 
constructs in the identity plot behind
them<00:03:15.560> is<00:03:16.599> completely<00:03:17.599> fabricated<00:03:17.810> I<00:03:18.530> mean<00:03:19.069> we

00:03:19.390 --> 00:03:19.400 
them is completely fabricated I mean we

00:03:19.400 --> 00:03:21.879 
them is completely fabricated I mean we
we<00:03:20.150> really<00:03:20.450> do<00:03:20.660> eventually<00:03:21.440> have<00:03:21.590> to<00:03:21.620> move

00:03:21.879 --> 00:03:21.889 
we really do eventually have to move

00:03:21.889 --> 00:03:24.000 
we really do eventually have to move
beyond<00:03:22.220> this<00:03:22.400> idea<00:03:22.609> of<00:03:22.940> countries<00:03:23.450> because

00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:24.010 
beyond this idea of countries because

00:03:24.010 --> 00:03:27.430 
beyond this idea of countries because
even<00:03:25.010> this<00:03:25.250> in<00:03:25.609> the<00:03:25.880> minimal<00:03:26.540> meaninglessness

00:03:27.430 --> 00:03:27.440 
even this in the minimal meaninglessness

00:03:27.440 --> 00:03:31.870 
even this in the minimal meaninglessness
of<00:03:27.829> the<00:03:28.639> whole<00:03:28.849> incident<00:03:29.840> is<00:03:30.489> really<00:03:31.489> just<00:03:31.700> too

00:03:31.870 --> 00:03:31.880 
of the whole incident is really just too
