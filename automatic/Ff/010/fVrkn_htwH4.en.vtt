this<00:00:21.810> is<00:00:22.050> what<00:00:22.590> I<00:00:22.619> call<00:00:22.829> stretch<00:00:23.130> exercise

00:00:23.479 --> 00:00:23.489 
this is what I call stretch exercise

pull over now if you're familiar with my
compound<00:00:25.980> exercise<00:00:26.430> overload<00:00:26.820> technique

00:00:27.200 --> 00:00:27.210 
compound exercise overload technique

00:00:27.210 --> 00:00:29.479 
compound exercise overload technique
where<00:00:27.779> you<00:00:27.960> do<00:00:28.140> three<00:00:28.410> reps<00:00:28.529> sets<00:00:28.800> on<00:00:29.070> 30

00:00:29.479 --> 00:00:29.489 
where you do three reps sets on 30

00:00:29.489 --> 00:00:31.729 
where you do three reps sets on 30
seconds<00:00:29.910> rest<00:00:30.059> that<00:00:30.270> like<00:00:30.390> a<00:00:30.570> squat<00:00:30.960> Phillip

exercise<00:00:33.360> this<00:00:34.110> is<00:00:34.170> very<00:00:34.620> similar<00:00:34.890> this<00:00:35.430> is

00:00:35.630 --> 00:00:35.640 
exercise this is very similar this is

00:00:35.640 --> 00:00:38.029 
exercise this is very similar this is
the<00:00:35.760> same<00:00:35.969> concept<00:00:36.239> only<00:00:37.170> done<00:00:37.350> with<00:00:37.710> stretch

00:00:38.029 --> 00:00:38.039 
the same concept only done with stretch

00:00:38.039 --> 00:00:40.760 
the same concept only done with stretch
position<00:00:38.190> exercises<00:00:39.090> now<00:00:39.690> the<00:00:40.410> reason<00:00:40.680> this

00:00:40.760 --> 00:00:40.770 
position exercises now the reason this

00:00:40.770 --> 00:00:43.009 
position exercises now the reason this
is<00:00:40.920> so<00:00:41.070> good<00:00:41.280> is<00:00:41.489> that<00:00:41.520> I<00:00:41.940> believe<00:00:42.420> that<00:00:42.449> I<00:00:42.870> have

00:00:43.009 --> 00:00:43.019 
is so good is that I believe that I have

00:00:43.019 --> 00:00:45.110 
is so good is that I believe that I have
no<00:00:43.350> you<00:00:44.010> know<00:00:44.100> scientific<00:00:44.489> studies<00:00:44.909> to<00:00:44.940> back

00:00:45.110 --> 00:00:45.120 
no you know scientific studies to back

00:00:45.120 --> 00:00:48.590 
no you know scientific studies to back
this<00:00:45.179> up<00:00:45.440> other<00:00:46.440> than<00:00:46.530> like<00:00:46.850> you<00:00:47.850> know<00:00:47.909> pulling

00:00:48.590 --> 00:00:48.600 
this up other than like you know pulling

00:00:48.600 --> 00:00:50.989 
this up other than like you know pulling
ideas<00:00:49.109> from<00:00:49.230> animal<00:00:49.589> based<00:00:49.739> studies<00:00:50.069> is<00:00:50.670> that

00:00:50.989 --> 00:00:50.999 
ideas from animal based studies is that

00:00:50.999 --> 00:00:53.540 
ideas from animal based studies is that
its<00:00:51.329> massive<00:00:51.749> stretch<00:00:51.989> overload<00:00:52.469> thing<00:00:53.190> can

00:00:53.540 --> 00:00:53.550 
its massive stretch overload thing can

00:00:53.550 --> 00:00:55.069 
its massive stretch overload thing can
result<00:00:53.789> in<00:00:53.969> hyperplasia<00:00:54.449> in<00:00:54.719> the<00:00:54.809> muscle

00:00:55.069 --> 00:00:55.079 
result in hyperplasia in the muscle

00:00:55.079 --> 00:00:57.229 
result in hyperplasia in the muscle
cells<00:00:55.289> which<00:00:55.829> basically<00:00:56.190> means<00:00:56.519> splitting<00:00:57.059> of

00:00:57.229 --> 00:00:57.239 
cells which basically means splitting of

00:00:57.239 --> 00:00:59.149 
cells which basically means splitting of
the<00:00:57.329> muscle<00:00:57.600> cells<00:00:57.809> into<00:00:58.140> you<00:00:58.739> know<00:00:58.829> two<00:00:59.039> or

00:00:59.149 --> 00:00:59.159 
the muscle cells into you know two or

00:00:59.159 --> 00:01:01.910 
the muscle cells into you know two or
more<00:00:59.280> muscle<00:00:59.609> cells<00:00:59.789> now<00:01:00.359> the<00:01:01.109> tension<00:01:01.469> and

00:01:01.910 --> 00:01:01.920 
more muscle cells now the tension and

00:01:01.920 --> 00:01:03.950 
more muscle cells now the tension and
the<00:01:02.129> amount<00:01:02.909> of<00:01:03.059> tension<00:01:03.239> required<00:01:03.719> for<00:01:03.899> this

00:01:03.950 --> 00:01:03.960 
the amount of tension required for this

00:01:03.960 --> 00:01:06.020 
the amount of tension required for this
is<00:01:04.140> pretty<00:01:04.290> tremendous<00:01:04.830> so<00:01:05.159> it's<00:01:05.700> a<00:01:05.790> very

00:01:06.020 --> 00:01:06.030 
is pretty tremendous so it's a very

00:01:06.030 --> 00:01:08.300 
is pretty tremendous so it's a very
uncomfortable<00:01:06.300> process<00:01:07.140> but<00:01:07.409> I<00:01:07.650> do<00:01:08.070> believe

00:01:08.300 --> 00:01:08.310 
uncomfortable process but I do believe

00:01:08.310 --> 00:01:10.130 
uncomfortable process but I do believe
it<00:01:08.580> can<00:01:08.729> happen<00:01:08.850> now<00:01:09.390> like<00:01:09.810> I<00:01:09.840> said<00:01:10.020> I<00:01:10.049> don't

00:01:10.130 --> 00:01:10.140 
it can happen now like I said I don't

00:01:10.140 --> 00:01:12.170 
it can happen now like I said I don't
have<00:01:10.260> any<00:01:10.440> specific<00:01:11.280> proof<00:01:11.520> of<00:01:11.670> this<00:01:11.790> because

00:01:12.170 --> 00:01:12.180 
have any specific proof of this because

00:01:12.180 --> 00:01:13.340 
have any specific proof of this because
in<00:01:12.450> order<00:01:12.540> to<00:01:12.659> get<00:01:12.780> proof<00:01:13.020> of<00:01:13.170> it<00:01:13.260> you

00:01:13.340 --> 00:01:13.350 
in order to get proof of it you

00:01:13.350 --> 00:01:15.230 
in order to get proof of it you
basically<00:01:13.470> have<00:01:13.770> to<00:01:13.920> bisect<00:01:14.550> your<00:01:14.910> muscle<00:01:15.180> and

00:01:15.230 --> 00:01:15.240 
basically have to bisect your muscle and

00:01:15.240 --> 00:01:16.730 
basically have to bisect your muscle and
count<00:01:15.540> muscle<00:01:15.900> fibers<00:01:16.200> to<00:01:16.320> really<00:01:16.500> prove<00:01:16.710> that

00:01:16.730 --> 00:01:16.740 
count muscle fibers to really prove that

00:01:16.740 --> 00:01:18.830 
count muscle fibers to really prove that
it<00:01:16.980> actually<00:01:17.100> happens<00:01:17.580> so<00:01:17.820> I<00:01:18.000> think<00:01:18.510> this

00:01:18.830 --> 00:01:18.840 
it actually happens so I think this

00:01:18.840 --> 00:01:20.840 
it actually happens so I think this
training<00:01:19.680> modality<00:01:19.830> really<00:01:20.340> comes<00:01:20.520> as<00:01:20.670> close

00:01:20.840 --> 00:01:20.850 
training modality really comes as close

00:01:20.850 --> 00:01:24.590 
training modality really comes as close
as<00:01:21.030> you<00:01:21.150> can<00:01:21.270> get<00:01:21.420> to<00:01:21.750> actual<00:01:22.640> hyperplasia<00:01:23.640> if

00:01:24.590 --> 00:01:24.600 
as you can get to actual hyperplasia if

00:01:24.600 --> 00:01:26.340 
as you can get to actual hyperplasia if
not<00:01:24.930> actually<00:01:25.260> getting<00:01:25.470> at<00:01:25.620> the<00:01:25.740> place

00:01:26.340 --> 00:01:26.350 
not actually getting at the place

00:01:26.350 --> 00:01:28.470 
not actually getting at the place
clarify<00:01:27.130> that<00:01:27.280> so<00:01:27.850> essentially<00:01:28.330> what<00:01:28.420> you're

00:01:28.470 --> 00:01:28.480 
clarify that so essentially what you're

00:01:28.480 --> 00:01:30.690 
clarify that so essentially what you're
going<00:01:28.630> to<00:01:28.660> do<00:01:28.840> is<00:01:29.310> demo<00:01:30.310> I'm<00:01:30.400> going<00:01:30.520> to<00:01:30.580> show

00:01:30.690 --> 00:01:30.700 
going to do is demo I'm going to show

00:01:30.700 --> 00:01:32.280 
going to do is demo I'm going to show
you<00:01:30.730> is<00:01:31.060> forearm<00:01:31.480> training<00:01:31.840> I'm<00:01:32.020> going<00:01:32.170> to<00:01:32.230> be

00:01:32.280 --> 00:01:32.290 
you is forearm training I'm going to be

00:01:32.290 --> 00:01:33.720 
you is forearm training I'm going to be
going<00:01:32.470> back<00:01:32.590> and<00:01:32.770> forth<00:01:32.980> between<00:01:33.100> incline

00:01:33.720 --> 00:01:33.730 
going back and forth between incline

00:01:33.730 --> 00:01:35.640 
going back and forth between incline
dumbbell<00:01:33.910> curls<00:01:34.360> and<00:01:34.510> bodyweight<00:01:35.380> tricep

00:01:35.640 --> 00:01:35.650 
dumbbell curls and bodyweight tricep

00:01:35.650 --> 00:01:37.650 
dumbbell curls and bodyweight tricep
extensions<00:01:36.370> now<00:01:36.640> the<00:01:37.240> incline<00:01:37.540> dumbbell

00:01:37.650 --> 00:01:37.660 
extensions now the incline dumbbell

00:01:37.660 --> 00:01:38.880 
extensions now the incline dumbbell
curls<00:01:38.110> are<00:01:38.170> going<00:01:38.290> to<00:01:38.350> be<00:01:38.410> done<00:01:38.530> over<00:01:38.680> the<00:01:38.770> end

00:01:38.880 --> 00:01:38.890 
curls are going to be done over the end

00:01:38.890 --> 00:01:40.130 
curls are going to be done over the end
of<00:01:38.950> the<00:01:39.010> bench<00:01:39.190> and<00:01:39.340> basically<00:01:39.670> that<00:01:39.790> is

00:01:40.130 --> 00:01:40.140 
of the bench and basically that is

00:01:40.140 --> 00:01:42.240 
of the bench and basically that is
massive<00:01:41.140> stretch<00:01:41.350> on<00:01:41.500> the<00:01:41.560> biceps<00:01:41.950> they're

00:01:42.240 --> 00:01:42.250 
massive stretch on the biceps they're

00:01:42.250 --> 00:01:44.790 
massive stretch on the biceps they're
stretched<00:01:42.640> back<00:01:42.850> behind<00:01:43.030> your<00:01:43.390> body<00:01:43.570> and<00:01:43.840> then

00:01:44.790 --> 00:01:44.800 
stretched back behind your body and then

00:01:44.800 --> 00:01:47.460 
stretched back behind your body and then
coming<00:01:45.130> up<00:01:45.280> now<00:01:45.729> on<00:01:45.940> each<00:01:46.090> rep<00:01:46.750> you're<00:01:47.320> going

00:01:47.460 --> 00:01:47.470 
coming up now on each rep you're going

00:01:47.470 --> 00:01:49.020 
coming up now on each rep you're going
to<00:01:47.530> hold<00:01:47.710> for<00:01:47.890> at<00:01:48.100> least<00:01:48.220> two<00:01:48.400> three<00:01:48.640> seconds

00:01:49.020 --> 00:01:49.030 
to hold for at least two three seconds

00:01:49.030 --> 00:01:50.520 
to hold for at least two three seconds
at<00:01:49.090> the<00:01:49.180> bottom<00:01:49.450> really<00:01:50.110> getting<00:01:50.320> as<00:01:50.410> much

00:01:50.520 --> 00:01:50.530 
at the bottom really getting as much

00:01:50.530 --> 00:01:52.260 
at the bottom really getting as much
stretch<00:01:50.860> as<00:01:51.010> possible<00:01:51.430> on<00:01:51.520> every<00:01:51.640> single<00:01:51.940> rep

00:01:52.260 --> 00:01:52.270 
stretch as possible on every single rep

00:01:52.270 --> 00:01:54.270 
stretch as possible on every single rep
now<00:01:52.750> when<00:01:53.410> you<00:01:53.500> go<00:01:53.560> to<00:01:53.680> the<00:01:53.740> bodyweight<00:01:54.040> tricep

00:01:54.270 --> 00:01:54.280 
now when you go to the bodyweight tricep

00:01:54.280 --> 00:01:56.219 
now when you go to the bodyweight tricep
extensions<00:01:55.000> that's<00:01:55.270> basically<00:01:55.630> an<00:01:55.900> overhead

00:01:56.219 --> 00:01:56.229 
extensions that's basically an overhead

00:01:56.229 --> 00:01:58.260 
extensions that's basically an overhead
extension<00:01:56.770> done<00:01:56.979> with<00:01:57.550> your<00:01:57.670> bodyweight<00:01:57.940> this

00:01:58.260 --> 00:01:58.270 
extension done with your bodyweight this

00:01:58.270 --> 00:02:00.359 
extension done with your bodyweight this
is<00:01:58.570> the<00:01:58.780> maximum<00:01:59.229> anatomical<00:01:59.860> position<00:02:00.190> of

00:02:00.359 --> 00:02:00.369 
is the maximum anatomical position of

00:02:00.369 --> 00:02:01.560 
is the maximum anatomical position of
stretch<00:02:00.640> from<00:02:00.759> the<00:02:00.880> triceps

00:02:01.560 --> 00:02:01.570 
stretch from the triceps

00:02:01.570 --> 00:02:03.480 
stretch from the triceps
so<00:02:01.810> going<00:02:02.500> back<00:02:02.619> and<00:02:02.890> forth<00:02:03.070> between<00:02:03.190> these

00:02:03.480 --> 00:02:03.490 
so going back and forth between these

00:02:03.490 --> 00:02:05.070 
so going back and forth between these
two<00:02:03.670> exercises<00:02:03.940> you're<00:02:04.600> going<00:02:04.630> to<00:02:04.810> have<00:02:04.900> 10

00:02:05.070 --> 00:02:05.080 
two exercises you're going to have 10

00:02:05.080 --> 00:02:07.530 
two exercises you're going to have 10
seconds<00:02:05.440> rest<00:02:05.619> in<00:02:05.979> between<00:02:06.070> now<00:02:06.970> as<00:02:07.240> you<00:02:07.390> see

00:02:07.530 --> 00:02:07.540 
seconds rest in between now as you see

00:02:07.540 --> 00:02:08.880 
seconds rest in between now as you see
in<00:02:07.630> the<00:02:07.690> video<00:02:07.960> when<00:02:08.140> I'm<00:02:08.229> demonstrating<00:02:08.380> this

00:02:08.880 --> 00:02:08.890 
in the video when I'm demonstrating this

00:02:08.890 --> 00:02:11.100 
in the video when I'm demonstrating this
the<00:02:09.729> 10<00:02:09.940> seconds<00:02:10.270> goes<00:02:10.390> by<00:02:10.420> really<00:02:10.750> fast

00:02:11.100 --> 00:02:11.110 
the 10 seconds goes by really fast

00:02:11.110 --> 00:02:13.530 
the 10 seconds goes by really fast
basically<00:02:11.470> that<00:02:11.740> 10<00:02:11.950> seconds<00:02:12.400> is<00:02:12.550> taken<00:02:13.270> up<00:02:13.360> by

00:02:13.530 --> 00:02:13.540 
basically that 10 seconds is taken up by

00:02:13.540 --> 00:02:15.630 
basically that 10 seconds is taken up by
me<00:02:13.720> moving<00:02:14.050> from<00:02:14.200> one<00:02:14.290> exercise<00:02:14.380> back<00:02:15.370> over

00:02:15.630 --> 00:02:15.640 
me moving from one exercise back over

00:02:15.640 --> 00:02:17.190 
me moving from one exercise back over
the<00:02:15.760> other<00:02:15.820> exercise<00:02:16.360> is<00:02:16.660> really<00:02:16.810> not<00:02:17.050> much

00:02:17.190 --> 00:02:17.200 
the other exercise is really not much

00:02:17.200 --> 00:02:18.810 
the other exercise is really not much
rest<00:02:17.500> involved<00:02:17.920> if<00:02:18.370> you're<00:02:18.550> doing<00:02:18.670> an

00:02:18.810 --> 00:02:18.820 
rest involved if you're doing an

00:02:18.820 --> 00:02:20.610 
rest involved if you're doing an
exercise<00:02:19.090> like<00:02:19.300> dumbbell<00:02:19.600> flyes<00:02:19.840> for<00:02:20.290> example

00:02:20.610 --> 00:02:20.620 
exercise like dumbbell flyes for example

00:02:20.620 --> 00:02:22.440 
exercise like dumbbell flyes for example
you<00:02:21.070> go<00:02:21.250> with<00:02:21.430> either<00:02:21.640> about<00:02:21.760> 20<00:02:22.060> or<00:02:22.209> 30

00:02:22.440 --> 00:02:22.450 
you go with either about 20 or 30

00:02:22.450 --> 00:02:23.910 
you go with either about 20 or 30
seconds<00:02:22.780> rest<00:02:23.020> to<00:02:23.170> a<00:02:23.200> little<00:02:23.500> bit<00:02:23.560> more<00:02:23.620> time

00:02:23.910 --> 00:02:23.920 
seconds rest to a little bit more time

00:02:23.920 --> 00:02:25.530 
seconds rest to a little bit more time
in<00:02:23.950> between<00:02:24.340> so<00:02:24.489> you<00:02:24.610> could<00:02:24.730> actually<00:02:24.850> you

00:02:25.530 --> 00:02:25.540 
in between so you could actually you

00:02:25.540 --> 00:02:27.510 
in between so you could actually you
know<00:02:25.630> keep<00:02:26.200> that<00:02:26.320> intensity<00:02:26.680> level<00:02:26.800> up<00:02:27.160> when

00:02:27.510 --> 00:02:27.520 
know keep that intensity level up when

00:02:27.520 --> 00:02:28.770 
know keep that intensity level up when
you<00:02:27.580> went<00:02:27.790> back<00:02:27.910> and<00:02:28.030> forth<00:02:28.150> between<00:02:28.300> arms

00:02:28.770 --> 00:02:28.780 
you went back and forth between arms

00:02:28.780 --> 00:02:30.300 
you went back and forth between arms
biceps<00:02:29.470> and<00:02:29.830> triceps

00:02:30.300 --> 00:02:30.310 
biceps and triceps

00:02:30.310 --> 00:02:32.759 
biceps and triceps
you<00:02:30.820> get<00:02:30.970> a<00:02:31.000> little<00:02:31.209> you<00:02:32.080> know<00:02:32.110> contralateral

00:02:32.759 --> 00:02:32.769 
you get a little you know contralateral

00:02:32.769 --> 00:02:35.820 
you get a little you know contralateral
and<00:02:33.220> muscle<00:02:33.640> activation<00:02:34.150> so<00:02:34.330> it's<00:02:34.830> possible

00:02:35.820 --> 00:02:35.830 
and muscle activation so it's possible

00:02:35.830 --> 00:02:36.960 
and muscle activation so it's possible
to<00:02:35.890> actually<00:02:36.100> maintain<00:02:36.250> your<00:02:36.489> strength<00:02:36.670> a<00:02:36.850> bit

00:02:36.960 --> 00:02:36.970 
to actually maintain your strength a bit

00:02:36.970 --> 00:02:39.330 
to actually maintain your strength a bit
better<00:02:37.120> so<00:02:37.600> side<00:02:38.440> more<00:02:38.680> talking<00:02:38.980> I'm<00:02:39.130> going<00:02:39.250> to

00:02:39.330 --> 00:02:39.340 
better so side more talking I'm going to

00:02:39.340 --> 00:02:40.410 
better so side more talking I'm going to
show<00:02:39.459> you<00:02:39.489> exactly<00:02:39.790> what<00:02:40.030> I'm<00:02:40.090> talking<00:02:40.390> about

00:02:40.410 --> 00:02:40.420 
show you exactly what I'm talking about

00:02:40.420 --> 00:02:42.960 
show you exactly what I'm talking about
this<00:02:41.170> is<00:02:41.260> a<00:02:41.320> great<00:02:41.530> technique<00:02:41.920> and<00:02:42.100> you<00:02:42.880> know

00:02:42.960 --> 00:02:42.970 
this is a great technique and you know

00:02:42.970 --> 00:02:44.820 
this is a great technique and you know
like<00:02:43.120> I<00:02:43.150> said<00:02:43.299> it's<00:02:43.480> not<00:02:43.630> painful<00:02:43.989> that<00:02:44.620> these

00:02:44.820 --> 00:02:44.830 
like I said it's not painful that these

00:02:44.830 --> 00:02:46.050 
like I said it's not painful that these
about<00:02:45.070> as<00:02:45.190> close<00:02:45.340> as<00:02:45.400> you<00:02:45.640> can<00:02:45.700> get<00:02:45.820> the<00:02:45.940> actual

00:02:46.050 --> 00:02:46.060 
about as close as you can get the actual

00:02:46.060 --> 00:05:03.520 
about as close as you can get the actual
hyperplasia<00:02:46.930> humans

00:05:03.520 --> 00:05:03.530 

00:05:03.530 --> 00:05:36.300 

to

00:05:36.300 --> 00:05:36.310 

00:05:36.310 --> 00:05:39.120 

so<00:05:37.310> that's<00:05:37.460> stretch<00:05:37.759> exercise<00:05:38.090> overload<00:05:38.690> now

00:05:39.120 --> 00:05:39.130 
so that's stretch exercise overload now

00:05:39.130 --> 00:05:41.260 
so that's stretch exercise overload now
you<00:05:40.130> would<00:05:40.280> do<00:05:40.370> this<00:05:40.520> for<00:05:40.580> 40<00:05:41.120> minutes

00:05:41.260 --> 00:05:41.270 
you would do this for 40 minutes

00:05:41.270 --> 00:05:43.210 
you would do this for 40 minutes
straight<00:05:41.660> so<00:05:42.020> this<00:05:42.139> is<00:05:42.259> 10<00:05:42.470> seconds<00:05:42.860> rest

00:05:43.210 --> 00:05:43.220 
straight so this is 10 seconds rest

00:05:43.220 --> 00:05:44.950 
straight so this is 10 seconds rest
40<00:05:43.490> minutes<00:05:43.669> straight<00:05:44.000> you're<00:05:44.630> going<00:05:44.660> to<00:05:44.900> be

00:05:44.950 --> 00:05:44.960 
40 minutes straight you're going to be

00:05:44.960 --> 00:05:46.480 
40 minutes straight you're going to be
taking<00:05:45.259> a<00:05:45.350> week<00:05:45.560> on<00:05:45.740> the<00:05:45.800> first<00:05:45.979> set<00:05:46.220> that<00:05:46.400> you

00:05:46.480 --> 00:05:46.490 
taking a week on the first set that you

00:05:46.490 --> 00:05:48.760 
taking a week on the first set that you
can<00:05:46.610> get<00:05:46.729> at<00:05:46.910> least<00:05:47.030> 6<00:05:47.509> reps<00:05:47.780> with<00:05:48.020> and<00:05:48.350> then

00:05:48.760 --> 00:05:48.770 
can get at least 6 reps with and then

00:05:48.770 --> 00:05:49.870 
can get at least 6 reps with and then
you're<00:05:48.860> going<00:05:48.949> to<00:05:49.039> just<00:05:49.130> do<00:05:49.250> three<00:05:49.490> reps<00:05:49.610> with

00:05:49.870 --> 00:05:49.880 
you're going to just do three reps with

00:05:49.880 --> 00:05:50.260 
you're going to just do three reps with
it

00:05:50.260 --> 00:05:50.270 
it

00:05:50.270 --> 00:05:51.490 
it
and<00:05:50.389> you're<00:05:50.720> going<00:05:50.810> to<00:05:50.870> keep<00:05:51.020> on<00:05:51.139> doing<00:05:51.199> those

00:05:51.490 --> 00:05:51.500 
and you're going to keep on doing those

00:05:51.500 --> 00:05:53.409 
and you're going to keep on doing those
three<00:05:51.710> rep<00:05:51.949> sets<00:05:52.220> until<00:05:52.970> you<00:05:53.060> can't<00:05:53.270> give

00:05:53.409 --> 00:05:53.419 
three rep sets until you can't give

00:05:53.419 --> 00:05:54.520 
three rep sets until you can't give
those<00:05:53.600> three<00:05:53.810> reps<00:05:54.020> anymore

00:05:54.520 --> 00:05:54.530 
those three reps anymore

00:05:54.530 --> 00:05:55.480 
those three reps anymore
that<00:05:54.650> you're<00:05:54.740> going<00:05:54.889> to<00:05:54.949> reduce<00:05:55.070> the<00:05:55.370> weight

00:05:55.480 --> 00:05:55.490 
that you're going to reduce the weight

00:05:55.490 --> 00:05:57.640 
that you're going to reduce the weight
in<00:05:55.940> my<00:05:56.000> case<00:05:56.270> I<00:05:56.419> started<00:05:56.750> with<00:05:56.840> pair<00:05:57.050> 35<00:05:57.440> pound

00:05:57.640 --> 00:05:57.650 
in my case I started with pair 35 pound

00:05:57.650 --> 00:05:59.290 
in my case I started with pair 35 pound
dumbbells<00:05:58.039> and<00:05:58.250> like<00:05:58.940> I<00:05:58.970> said<00:05:59.030> you<00:05:59.120> don't<00:05:59.210> want

00:05:59.290 --> 00:05:59.300 
dumbbells and like I said you don't want

00:05:59.300 --> 00:06:01.390 
dumbbells and like I said you don't want
to<00:05:59.449> go<00:05:59.509> heavy<00:05:59.690> on<00:05:59.870> this<00:06:00.020> 35<00:06:00.590> it's<00:06:00.770> down<00:06:00.919> to<00:06:01.039> 30s

00:06:01.390 --> 00:06:01.400 
to go heavy on this 35 it's down to 30s

00:06:01.400 --> 00:06:03.370 
to go heavy on this 35 it's down to 30s
now<00:06:01.850> -<00:06:01.910> 25<00:06:02.389> -<00:06:02.539> they<00:06:02.630> managed<00:06:02.870> to<00:06:02.900> stay<00:06:03.139> on<00:06:03.259> there

00:06:03.370 --> 00:06:03.380 
now - 25 - they managed to stay on there

00:06:03.380 --> 00:06:05.320 
now - 25 - they managed to stay on there

00:06:05.320 --> 00:06:05.330 
for us to the time period body weight

00:06:05.330 --> 00:06:06.430 
for us to the time period body weight
exercise<00:06:05.750> like<00:06:05.900> that<00:06:06.050> I<00:06:06.080> was<00:06:06.320> graduating

00:06:06.430 --> 00:06:06.440 
exercise like that I was graduating

00:06:06.440 --> 00:06:07.840 
exercise like that I was graduating
moving<00:06:06.860> my<00:06:06.949> feet<00:06:07.160> in<00:06:07.310> a<00:06:07.340> little<00:06:07.490> bit<00:06:07.669> closer

00:06:07.840 --> 00:06:07.850 
moving my feet in a little bit closer

00:06:07.850 --> 00:06:10.719 
moving my feet in a little bit closer
and<00:06:08.090> closer<00:06:08.300> now<00:06:08.979> Mike's<00:06:09.979> in<00:06:10.130> 40<00:06:10.400> minutes<00:06:10.580> of

00:06:10.719 --> 00:06:10.729 
and closer now Mike's in 40 minutes of

00:06:10.729 --> 00:06:11.980 
and closer now Mike's in 40 minutes of
this<00:06:10.820> straight<00:06:11.090> and<00:06:11.389> you're<00:06:11.570> really<00:06:11.810> going<00:06:11.930> to

00:06:11.980 --> 00:06:11.990 
this straight and you're really going to

00:06:11.990 --> 00:06:13.870 
this straight and you're really going to
be<00:06:12.080> feeling<00:06:12.410> it<00:06:12.500> this<00:06:12.620> is<00:06:12.770> a<00:06:13.039> really<00:06:13.610> a<00:06:13.639> massive

00:06:13.870 --> 00:06:13.880 
be feeling it this is a really a massive

00:06:13.880 --> 00:06:15.249 
be feeling it this is a really a massive
amount<00:06:14.240> of<00:06:14.330> volume<00:06:14.509> with<00:06:14.720> a<00:06:14.750> lot<00:06:14.900> of<00:06:14.990> time<00:06:15.110> to

00:06:15.249 --> 00:06:15.259 
amount of volume with a lot of time to

00:06:15.259 --> 00:06:17.110 
amount of volume with a lot of time to
be<00:06:15.349> spent<00:06:15.380> in<00:06:15.650> a<00:06:15.710> stretch<00:06:15.979> position<00:06:16.009> which<00:06:17.000> i

00:06:17.110 --> 00:06:17.120 
be spent in a stretch position which i

00:06:17.120 --> 00:06:18.159 
be spent in a stretch position which i
think<00:06:17.180> is<00:06:17.389> really<00:06:17.599> the<00:06:17.720> key<00:06:17.870> to<00:06:18.080> achieving

00:06:18.159 --> 00:06:18.169 
think is really the key to achieving

00:06:18.169 --> 00:06:20.950 
think is really the key to achieving
that<00:06:18.860> equation<00:06:19.190> in<00:06:19.430> people<00:06:19.759> so<00:06:20.000> definitely

00:06:20.950 --> 00:06:20.960 
that equation in people so definitely

00:06:20.960 --> 00:06:22.420 
that equation in people so definitely
give<00:06:21.050> this<00:06:21.110> one<00:06:21.259> a<00:06:21.320> try<00:06:21.380> if<00:06:21.800> you're<00:06:22.039> a<00:06:22.099> glutton

00:06:22.420 --> 00:06:22.430 
give this one a try if you're a glutton

00:06:22.430 --> 00:06:23.890 
give this one a try if you're a glutton
for<00:06:22.699> punishment<00:06:22.729> and<00:06:23.270> you<00:06:23.389> really<00:06:23.660> want<00:06:23.810> to

00:06:23.890 --> 00:06:23.900 
for punishment and you really want to

00:06:23.900 --> 00:06:26.320 
for punishment and you really want to
see<00:06:24.020> what<00:06:24.169> your<00:06:24.349> pain<00:06:24.979> threshold<00:06:25.009> is<00:06:25.580> because

00:06:26.320 --> 00:06:26.330 
see what your pain threshold is because

00:06:26.330 --> 00:06:28.300 
see what your pain threshold is because
this<00:06:26.509> one<00:06:26.690> will<00:06:26.870> really<00:06:27.020> push<00:06:27.320> it<00:06:27.349> is<00:06:27.650> tough

00:06:28.300 --> 00:06:28.310 
this one will really push it is tough

00:06:28.310 --> 00:06:30.370 
this one will really push it is tough
training<00:06:28.580> but<00:06:29.210> it<00:06:29.330> is<00:06:29.419> very<00:06:29.690> effective<00:06:29.930> and

00:06:30.370 --> 00:06:30.380 
training but it is very effective and

00:06:30.380 --> 00:06:32.529 
training but it is very effective and
even<00:06:31.160> if<00:06:31.250> you<00:06:31.370> don't<00:06:31.580> get<00:06:31.729> hyperplasia<00:06:32.240> you're

00:06:32.529 --> 00:06:32.539 
even if you don't get hyperplasia you're

00:06:32.539 --> 00:06:33.520 
even if you don't get hyperplasia you're
really<00:06:32.780> going<00:06:32.900> to<00:06:32.990> get<00:06:33.080> a<00:06:33.110> lot<00:06:33.259> out<00:06:33.289> of<00:06:33.440> it

00:06:33.520 --> 00:06:33.530 
really going to get a lot out of it

00:06:33.530 --> 00:06:35.140 
really going to get a lot out of it
because<00:06:33.590> of<00:06:33.860> the<00:06:34.070> amount<00:06:34.370> of<00:06:34.580> time<00:06:34.729> spent<00:06:35.060> in

00:06:35.140 --> 00:06:35.150 
because of the amount of time spent in

00:06:35.150 --> 00:06:38.320 
because of the amount of time spent in
the<00:06:35.270> stretch<00:06:35.479> it<00:06:35.599> is<00:06:35.690> showing<00:06:35.930> each<00:06:36.020> exercise
