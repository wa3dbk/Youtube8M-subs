buttoned up we'll believe the my
cylinder<00:01:57.840> and<00:01:57.960> then<00:01:58.110> bleed<00:01:58.350> the<00:01:58.470> brakes<00:01:58.880> our

cylinder and then bleed the brakes our

00:01:59.880 --> 00:02:01.580 
cylinder and then bleed the brakes our
next<00:02:00.149> step<00:02:00.330> is<00:02:00.479> to<00:02:00.630> bleed<00:02:00.899> our<00:02:01.170> brand-new

00:02:01.580 --> 00:02:01.590 
next step is to bleed our brand-new

00:02:01.590 --> 00:02:03.770 
next step is to bleed our brand-new
master<00:02:01.860> cylinder<00:02:02.460> self<00:02:02.820> it's<00:02:03.539> usually

master cylinder self it's usually

00:02:03.780 --> 00:02:05.900 
master cylinder self it's usually
recommended<00:02:04.470> to<00:02:04.560> do<00:02:04.710> this<00:02:04.979> out<00:02:05.369> of<00:02:05.610> the<00:02:05.700> car

00:02:05.900 --> 00:02:05.910 
recommended to do this out of the car

00:02:05.910 --> 00:02:07.580 
recommended to do this out of the car
but<00:02:06.149> you<00:02:06.180> can<00:02:06.509> do<00:02:06.750> it<00:02:06.840> in<00:02:06.960> the<00:02:07.080> car<00:02:07.289> the<00:02:07.470> only

00:02:07.580 --> 00:02:07.590 
but you can do it in the car the only

00:02:07.590 --> 00:02:09.590 
but you can do it in the car the only
thing<00:02:07.770> you<00:02:07.860> need<00:02:08.040> is<00:02:08.760> something<00:02:08.970> like<00:02:09.209> this<00:02:09.390> I

00:02:09.590 --> 00:02:09.600 
thing you need is something like this I

00:02:09.600 --> 00:02:11.840 
thing you need is something like this I
put<00:02:09.840> a<00:02:09.869> little<00:02:10.049> plug<00:02:10.410> in<00:02:10.590> the<00:02:10.739> outlet<00:02:11.610> for<00:02:11.760> the

00:02:11.840 --> 00:02:11.850 
put a little plug in the outlet for the

00:02:11.850 --> 00:02:13.220 
put a little plug in the outlet for the
brake<00:02:12.030> fluid<00:02:12.060> here's<00:02:12.510> the<00:02:12.600> brake<00:02:12.780> line

00:02:13.220 --> 00:02:13.230 
brake fluid here's the brake line

00:02:13.230 --> 00:02:16.310 
brake fluid here's the brake line
and<00:02:13.350> so<00:02:14.160> the<00:02:14.640> point<00:02:14.910> of<00:02:15.060> this<00:02:15.239> is<00:02:15.900> to<00:02:16.019> get<00:02:16.140> all

00:02:16.310 --> 00:02:16.320 
and so the point of this is to get all

00:02:16.320 --> 00:02:18.710 
and so the point of this is to get all
the<00:02:16.350> air<00:02:16.620> out<00:02:16.830> of<00:02:17.250> the<00:02:17.790> master<00:02:18.000> cylinder<00:02:18.330> what

00:02:18.710 --> 00:02:18.720 
the air out of the master cylinder what

00:02:18.720 --> 00:02:20.509 
the air out of the master cylinder what
I<00:02:18.750> usually<00:02:19.049> like<00:02:19.140> to<00:02:19.230> do<00:02:19.380> is<00:02:19.530> I<00:02:19.650> get<00:02:19.709> you<00:02:20.400> know<00:02:20.489> a

00:02:20.509 --> 00:02:20.519 
I usually like to do is I get you know a

00:02:20.519 --> 00:02:22.610 
I usually like to do is I get you know a
coke<00:02:21.299> bottle<00:02:21.330> or<00:02:21.750> water<00:02:21.989> bottle<00:02:22.350> for<00:02:22.470> that

00:02:22.610 --> 00:02:22.620 
coke bottle or water bottle for that

00:02:22.620 --> 00:02:23.900 
coke bottle or water bottle for that
whole<00:02:22.769> brake<00:02:23.010> fluid<00:02:23.280> and<00:02:23.370> then<00:02:23.459> pour<00:02:23.730> it<00:02:23.820> in

00:02:23.900 --> 00:02:23.910 
whole brake fluid and then pour it in

00:02:23.910 --> 00:02:26.300 
whole brake fluid and then pour it in
there<00:02:24.120> that<00:02:24.299> way<00:02:25.290> it's<00:02:25.470> a<00:02:25.530> lot<00:02:25.680> easier<00:02:25.920> to<00:02:26.100> do

00:02:26.300 --> 00:02:26.310 
there that way it's a lot easier to do

00:02:26.310 --> 00:02:28.430 
there that way it's a lot easier to do
and<00:02:27.150> using<00:02:27.360> the<00:02:27.540> big<00:02:27.720> huge<00:02:27.930> doesn't<00:02:28.260> going<00:02:28.380> to

00:02:28.430 --> 00:02:28.440 
and using the big huge doesn't going to

00:02:28.440 --> 00:02:32.150 
and using the big huge doesn't going to
have<00:02:28.620> so<00:02:30.080> pretty<00:02:31.080> much<00:02:31.260> just<00:02:31.560> pump<00:02:31.860> and<00:02:32.040> pump

00:02:32.150 --> 00:02:32.160 
have so pretty much just pump and pump

00:02:32.160 --> 00:02:35.390 
have so pretty much just pump and pump
and<00:02:32.340> pump<00:02:32.489> go<00:02:32.880> slow<00:02:33.209> and<00:02:33.900> then<00:02:34.680> until<00:02:35.250> there's

00:02:35.390 --> 00:02:35.400 
and pump go slow and then until there's

00:02:35.400 --> 00:02:36.590 
and pump go slow and then until there's
no<00:02:35.489> more<00:02:35.670> air<00:02:35.790> bubbles<00:02:36.150> coming<00:02:36.360> up<00:02:36.390> now

00:02:36.590 --> 00:02:36.600 
no more air bubbles coming up now

00:02:36.600 --> 00:02:37.820 
no more air bubbles coming up now
remember<00:02:36.989> you<00:02:37.080> don't<00:02:37.110> want<00:02:37.380> to<00:02:37.440> get<00:02:37.530> any<00:02:37.680> of

00:02:37.820 --> 00:02:37.830 
remember you don't want to get any of

00:02:37.830 --> 00:02:39.620 
remember you don't want to get any of
this<00:02:37.950> on<00:02:38.160> your<00:02:38.340> paint<00:02:38.610> because<00:02:39.209> if<00:02:39.330> you<00:02:39.450> do

00:02:39.620 --> 00:02:39.630 
this on your paint because if you do

00:02:39.630 --> 00:02:41.090 
this on your paint because if you do
it's<00:02:39.840> gonna<00:02:39.959> start<00:02:40.320> looking<00:02:40.560> like<00:02:40.590> just<00:02:40.920> stuff

00:02:41.090 --> 00:02:41.100 
it's gonna start looking like just stuff

00:02:41.100 --> 00:02:47.270 
it's gonna start looking like just stuff
underneath<00:02:41.459> all<00:02:42.450> bubbled<00:02:42.930> up<00:02:43.019> and<00:02:43.230> asked

00:02:47.270 --> 00:02:47.280 

00:02:47.280 --> 00:02:50.070 

if<00:02:48.280> I<00:02:48.430> spill<00:02:48.760> any<00:02:49.000> will<00:02:49.330> put<00:02:49.510> this<00:02:49.630> little<00:02:49.900> rag

00:02:50.070 --> 00:02:50.080 
if I spill any will put this little rag

00:02:50.080 --> 00:02:57.150 
if I spill any will put this little rag
underneath<00:02:50.530> there

00:02:57.150 --> 00:02:57.160 

00:02:57.160 --> 00:03:05.940 

and<00:02:57.460> kind<00:02:57.670> of<00:02:57.730> see<00:02:57.910> the<00:02:57.970> level<00:02:58.390> inside

00:03:05.940 --> 00:03:05.950 

00:03:05.950 --> 00:03:09.059 

all<00:03:06.430> right<00:03:06.520> so<00:03:06.700> that's<00:03:06.819> full<00:03:07.120> enough<00:03:07.890> I'd<00:03:08.890> say

00:03:09.059 --> 00:03:09.069 
all right so that's full enough I'd say

00:03:09.069 --> 00:03:10.440 
all right so that's full enough I'd say
it's<00:03:09.220> mostly<00:03:09.340> people<00:03:09.670> at<00:03:09.760> the<00:03:09.819> top<00:03:10.030> the<00:03:10.180> reason

00:03:10.440 --> 00:03:10.450 
it's mostly people at the top the reason

00:03:10.450 --> 00:03:11.580 
it's mostly people at the top the reason
why<00:03:10.540> I'm<00:03:10.660> not<00:03:10.690> telling<00:03:10.930> it<00:03:11.080> all<00:03:11.170> the<00:03:11.260> way<00:03:11.319> up<00:03:11.440> is

00:03:11.580 --> 00:03:11.590 
why I'm not telling it all the way up is

00:03:11.590 --> 00:03:14.120 
why I'm not telling it all the way up is
because<00:03:11.950> if<00:03:12.640> you<00:03:12.760> push<00:03:13.000> on<00:03:13.120> it<00:03:13.270> hard<00:03:13.450> enough

00:03:14.120 --> 00:03:14.130 
because if you push on it hard enough

00:03:14.130 --> 00:03:17.070 
because if you push on it hard enough
fluid<00:03:15.130> can<00:03:15.250> actually<00:03:15.630> come<00:03:16.630> out<00:03:16.810> of<00:03:16.959> the

00:03:17.070 --> 00:03:17.080 
fluid can actually come out of the

00:03:17.080 --> 00:03:18.600 
fluid can actually come out of the
master<00:03:17.380> cylinder<00:03:17.560> to<00:03:17.770> spill<00:03:18.010> everywhere<00:03:18.190> so

00:03:18.600 --> 00:03:18.610 
master cylinder to spill everywhere so

00:03:18.610 --> 00:03:23.580 
master cylinder to spill everywhere so
let's<00:03:19.020> go<00:03:20.020> push<00:03:20.200> the<00:03:20.319> pedals<00:03:22.260> now<00:03:23.260> here<00:03:23.470> we<00:03:23.560> are

00:03:23.580 --> 00:03:23.590 
let's go push the pedals now here we are

00:03:23.590 --> 00:03:28.440 
let's go push the pedals now here we are
inside<00:03:23.890> the<00:03:24.040> car<00:03:24.310> so<00:03:26.910> best<00:03:27.910> thing<00:03:28.000> to<00:03:28.120> do<00:03:28.270> just

inside the car so best thing to do just

00:03:28.450 --> 00:03:30.809 
inside the car so best thing to do just
go<00:03:28.660> super<00:03:29.110> slow<00:03:29.260> I<00:03:29.410> wish<00:03:29.680> I<00:03:29.800> had<00:03:29.950> on<00:03:30.670> the
