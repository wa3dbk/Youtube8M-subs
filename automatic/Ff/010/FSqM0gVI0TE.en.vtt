00:01:53.039 --> 00:01:53.049 
are like RTS elements through that then

00:01:53.049 --> 00:01:55.139 
are like RTS elements through that then
of<00:01:53.350> course<00:01:53.409> because<00:01:54.310> of<00:01:54.340> the<00:01:54.640> connection<00:01:55.060> with

00:01:55.139 --> 00:01:55.149

00:03:13.100 --> 00:03:13.110 
play a game that happens in the universe

00:03:13.110 --> 00:03:16.340 
play a game that happens in the universe
so<00:03:13.710> by<00:03:14.040> sort<00:03:14.580> of<00:03:14.640> looking<00:03:15.210> at<00:03:15.390> that<00:03:15.540> we<00:03:15.600> we<00:03:16.260> were

00:03:16.340 --> 00:03:16.350 
so by sort of looking at that we we were

00:03:16.350 --> 00:03:18.440 
so by sort of looking at that we we were
able<00:03:16.470> to<00:03:16.650> sort<00:03:17.220> of<00:03:17.250> make<00:03:17.580> these<00:03:17.760> puzzle<00:03:18.420> pieces

00:03:18.440 --> 00:03:18.450 
able to sort of make these puzzle pieces

00:03:18.450 --> 00:03:20.960 
able to sort of make these puzzle pieces
fit<00:03:18.900> together<00:03:19.020> and<00:03:19.500> I<00:03:20.370> think<00:03:20.610> we<00:03:20.730> have<00:03:20.760> been

00:03:20.960 --> 00:03:20.970 
fit together and I think we have been

00:03:20.970 --> 00:03:23.960 
fit together and I think we have been
able<00:03:21.090> to<00:03:21.560> create<00:03:22.560> sort<00:03:22.770> of<00:03:22.830> a<00:03:22.980> symphony<00:03:23.490> effect

00:03:23.960 --> 00:03:23.970 
able to create sort of a symphony effect

00:03:23.970 --> 00:03:26.840 
able to create sort of a symphony effect
where<00:03:24.750> the<00:03:24.960> all<00:03:25.200> the<00:03:25.410> instruments<00:03:25.980> create

00:03:26.840 --> 00:03:26.850 
where the all the instruments create

00:03:26.850 --> 00:03:28.790 
where the all the instruments create
something<00:03:27.120> which<00:03:27.690> is<00:03:27.840> greater<00:03:28.080> than<00:03:28.320> just<00:03:28.680> the

00:03:28.790 --> 00:03:28.800 
something which is greater than just the

00:03:28.800 --> 00:03:31.070 
something which is greater than just the
sum<00:03:28.980> of<00:03:29.130> the<00:03:29.220> individual<00:03:29.610> parts<00:03:29.940> well<00:03:30.720> I<00:03:30.750> would

00:03:31.070 --> 00:03:31.080 
sum of the individual parts well I would

00:03:31.080 --> 00:03:33.530 
sum of the individual parts well I would
just<00:03:31.380> say<00:03:31.410> the<00:03:31.620> genre<00:03:32.040> itself<00:03:32.160> is<00:03:32.580> the<00:03:33.360> most

00:03:33.530 --> 00:03:33.540 
just say the genre itself is the most

00:03:33.540 --> 00:03:35.930 
just say the genre itself is the most
influential<00:03:34.020> part<00:03:34.650> if<00:03:34.950> you<00:03:35.100> see<00:03:35.580> how

00:03:35.930 --> 00:03:35.940 
influential part if you see how

00:03:35.940 --> 00:03:37.940 
influential part if you see how
first-person<00:03:36.570> shooters<00:03:36.900> have<00:03:37.110> have<00:03:37.470> evolved

00:03:37.940 --> 00:03:37.950 
first-person shooters have have evolved

00:03:37.950 --> 00:03:41.210 
first-person shooters have have evolved
over<00:03:38.730> time<00:03:39.450> there's<00:03:40.110> been<00:03:40.290> a<00:03:40.350> lot<00:03:41.190> of

00:03:41.210 --> 00:03:41.220 
over time there's been a lot of

00:03:41.220 --> 00:03:43.760 
over time there's been a lot of
innovation<00:03:41.760> in<00:03:41.970> terms<00:03:42.540> of<00:03:42.900> like<00:03:43.230> the

00:03:43.760 --> 00:03:43.770 
innovation in terms of like the

00:03:43.770 --> 00:03:47.180 
innovation in terms of like the
individual<00:03:44.370> types<00:03:45.150> of<00:03:45.800> classes<00:03:46.800> you<00:03:46.890> can<00:03:47.010> play

00:03:47.180 --> 00:03:47.190 
individual types of classes you can play

00:03:47.190 --> 00:03:48.500 
individual types of classes you can play
within<00:03:47.400> them<00:03:47.700> and<00:03:47.730> things<00:03:48.240> of<00:03:48.360> that<00:03:48.390> nature

00:03:48.500 --> 00:03:48.510 
within them and things of that nature

00:03:48.510 --> 00:03:52.910 
within them and things of that nature
but<00:03:49.410> they<00:03:50.220> lack<00:03:50.490> currently<00:03:51.450> a<00:03:51.920> meaningful

00:03:52.910 --> 00:03:52.920 
but they lack currently a meaningful

00:03:52.920 --> 00:03:55.970 
but they lack currently a meaningful
result<00:03:53.490> of<00:03:53.790> when<00:03:54.660> you<00:03:54.750> have<00:03:54.870> one<00:03:55.050> like<00:03:55.620> it's<00:03:55.860> a

00:03:55.970 --> 00:03:55.980 
result of when you have one like it's a

00:03:55.980 --> 00:03:57.500 
result of when you have one like it's a
little<00:03:56.280> bit<00:03:56.370> like<00:03:56.520> an<00:03:56.640> endless<00:03:56.910> deja<00:03:57.270> vu

00:03:57.500 --> 00:03:57.510 
little bit like an endless deja vu

00:03:57.510 --> 00:03:59.810

00:04:09.240 --> 00:04:11.780 
which you do in this shooter will have
an<00:04:09.450> implication<00:04:09.870> and<00:04:10.260> a<00:04:10.650> persistent<00:04:11.220> e<00:04:11.340> effect

00:04:11.780 --> 00:04:11.790 
an implication and a persistent e effect

00:04:11.790 --> 00:04:14.690 
an implication and a persistent e effect
and<00:04:12.060> I<00:04:12.590> from<00:04:13.590> being<00:04:13.980> a<00:04:14.040> first<00:04:14.430> person<00:04:14.520> shooter

00:04:14.690 --> 00:04:14.700 
and I from being a first person shooter

00:04:14.700 --> 00:04:17.210 
and I from being a first person shooter
myself<00:04:15.300> think<00:04:15.900> that's<00:04:16.140> a<00:04:16.350> great<00:04:16.650> addition<00:04:17.040> to

00:04:17.210 --> 00:04:17.220 
myself think that's a great addition to

00:04:17.220 --> 00:04:19.190 
myself think that's a great addition to
the<00:04:17.340> Chandra<00:04:17.820> and<00:04:17.989> really<00:04:18.989> the<00:04:19.080> next

00:04:19.190 --> 00:04:19.200 
the Chandra and really the next

00:04:19.200 --> 00:04:21.590 
the Chandra and really the next
evolution<00:04:19.520> for<00:04:20.520> later

00:04:21.590 --> 00:04:21.600 
evolution for later

00:04:21.600 --> 00:04:23.180 
evolution for later
so<00:04:21.690> we'll<00:04:21.870> be<00:04:21.990> able<00:04:22.020> to<00:04:22.290> play<00:04:22.440> the<00:04:22.770> sort<00:04:23.130> of

00:04:23.180 --> 00:04:23.190 
so we'll be able to play the sort of

00:04:23.190 --> 00:04:25.340 
so we'll be able to play the sort of
same<00:04:23.400> character<00:04:23.880> in<00:04:24.030> both<00:04:24.180> games<00:04:24.420> or<00:04:24.750> how<00:04:25.290> does

00:04:25.340 --> 00:04:25.350 
same character in both games or how does

00:04:25.350 --> 00:04:28.700 
same character in both games or how does
it<00:04:25.560> link<00:04:25.740> exactly<00:04:26.190> no<00:04:26.760> the<00:04:27.150> the<00:04:27.180> as<00:04:28.140> it's

00:04:28.700 --> 00:04:28.710 
it link exactly no the the as it's

00:04:28.710 --> 00:04:30.380 
it link exactly no the the as it's
explained<00:04:29.250> in<00:04:29.490> the<00:04:29.610> back<00:04:29.760> story<00:04:30.000> of<00:04:30.150> the<00:04:30.240> game

00:04:30.380 --> 00:04:30.390 
explained in the back story of the game

00:04:30.390 --> 00:04:32.840 
explained in the back story of the game
then<00:04:30.990> the<00:04:31.200> plot<00:04:31.440> pilots<00:04:31.920> are<00:04:32.280> very<00:04:32.580> different

00:04:32.840 --> 00:04:32.850 
then the plot pilots are very different

00:04:32.850 --> 00:04:36.110 
then the plot pilots are very different
types<00:04:33.540> of<00:04:33.690> people<00:04:34.020> than<00:04:34.230> the<00:04:35.190> mercenaries<00:04:35.940> and

00:04:36.110 --> 00:04:36.120 
types of people than the mercenaries and

00:04:36.120 --> 00:04:38.630 
types of people than the mercenaries and
it's<00:04:36.870> a<00:04:36.990> little<00:04:37.290> bit<00:04:37.410> like<00:04:37.620> the<00:04:38.040> Air<00:04:38.160> Force<00:04:38.430> and

00:04:38.630 --> 00:04:38.640 
it's a little bit like the Air Force and

00:04:38.640 --> 00:04:40.850 
it's a little bit like the Air Force and
the<00:04:38.820> Marines<00:04:38.910> you<00:04:39.900> aren't<00:04:40.290> really<00:04:40.500> a<00:04:40.530> marine

00:04:40.850 --> 00:04:40.860 
the Marines you aren't really a marine

00:04:40.860 --> 00:04:43.550 
the Marines you aren't really a marine
and<00:04:40.890> in<00:04:41.400> the<00:04:41.520> Air<00:04:41.610> Force<00:04:41.640> so<00:04:42.480> the<00:04:42.720> it's<00:04:42.990> sort<00:04:43.470> of

00:04:43.550 --> 00:04:43.560 
and in the Air Force so the it's sort of

00:04:43.560 --> 00:04:46.220 
and in the Air Force so the it's sort of
separated<00:04:44.070> like<00:04:44.310> that<00:04:44.480> these<00:04:45.480> are<00:04:45.780> at

00:04:46.220 --> 00:04:46.230 
separated like that these are at

00:04:46.230 --> 00:04:48.650 
separated like that these are at
different<00:04:46.830> types<00:04:47.220> of<00:04:47.370> people<00:04:47.700> so<00:04:48.210> you<00:04:48.300> don't

00:04:48.650 --> 00:04:48.660 
different types of people so you don't

00:04:48.660 --> 00:04:50.570 
different types of people so you don't
really<00:04:48.930> see<00:04:49.080> a<00:04:49.110> test<00:04:49.380> marine<00:04:49.770> jumping<00:04:50.340> into<00:04:50.460> a

00:04:50.570 --> 00:04:50.580 
really see a test marine jumping into a

00:04:50.580 --> 00:04:53.120 
really see a test marine jumping into a
pot<00:04:50.850> filled<00:04:51.540> with<00:04:51.660> gooey<00:04:51.990> fluids<00:04:52.500> plugging

00:04:53.120 --> 00:04:53.130 
pot filled with gooey fluids plugging

00:04:53.130 --> 00:04:55.190 
pot filled with gooey fluids plugging
into<00:04:53.280> his<00:04:53.670> spinal<00:04:53.940> cord<00:04:54.210> to<00:04:54.450> navigate<00:04:55.110> the

00:04:55.190 --> 00:04:55.200 
into his spinal cord to navigate the

00:04:55.200 --> 00:04:57.440 
into his spinal cord to navigate the
spaceship<00:04:55.560> he<00:04:56.460> would<00:04:56.610> rather<00:04:56.790> run<00:04:57.120> around

00:04:57.440 --> 00:04:57.450 
spaceship he would rather run around

00:04:57.450 --> 00:05:00.590 
spaceship he would rather run around
blows<00:04:57.900> it<00:04:58.080> up<00:04:58.110> and<00:04:58.610> like<00:04:59.610> that<00:04:59.940> that<00:05:00.390> is<00:05:00.510> the

00:05:00.590 --> 00:05:00.600 
blows it up and like that that is the

00:05:00.600 --> 00:05:03.140 
blows it up and like that that is the
perfect<00:05:00.810> that<00:05:01.200> is<00:05:01.320> a<00:05:01.350> skill<00:05:01.730> one<00:05:02.730> will<00:05:02.880> dust

00:05:03.140 --> 00:05:03.150 
perfect that is a skill one will dust

00:05:03.150 --> 00:05:05.630 
perfect that is a skill one will dust
514<00:05:03.420> be<00:05:03.780> available<00:05:04.200> for<00:05:04.320> the<00:05:04.380> public<00:05:04.550> we<00:05:05.550> have

00:05:05.630 --> 00:05:05.640 
514 be available for the public we have

00:05:05.640 --> 00:05:08.510 
514 be available for the public we have
not<00:05:05.760> announced<00:05:06.030> and<00:05:06.660> released<00:05:06.930> it<00:05:07.440> for<00:05:07.710> us

00:05:08.510 --> 00:05:08.520 
not announced and released it for us

00:05:08.520 --> 00:05:11.000 
not announced and released it for us
it's<00:05:08.730> most<00:05:08.940> important<00:05:09.390> that<00:05:09.420> we<00:05:09.660> realize<00:05:10.010> this

00:05:11.000 --> 00:05:11.010 
it's most important that we realize this

00:05:11.010 --> 00:05:14.450 
it's most important that we realize this
awesome<00:05:11.400> potential<00:05:11.730> we<00:05:12.060> we<00:05:12.890> we<00:05:13.890> all<00:05:14.040> sort<00:05:14.400> of

00:05:14.450 --> 00:05:14.460 
awesome potential we we we all sort of

00:05:14.460 --> 00:05:17.600 
awesome potential we we we all sort of
see<00:05:14.640> and<00:05:14.910> the<00:05:15.210> in<00:05:15.810> just<00:05:16.770> linking<00:05:17.190> up<00:05:17.340> with<00:05:17.370> Eve

00:05:17.600 --> 00:05:17.610 
see and the in just linking up with Eve

00:05:17.610 --> 00:05:19.880 
see and the in just linking up with Eve
and<00:05:17.870> it's<00:05:18.870> more<00:05:18.990> important<00:05:19.320> that<00:05:19.350> we<00:05:19.650> get<00:05:19.830> a

00:05:19.880 --> 00:05:19.890 
and it's more important that we get a

00:05:19.890 --> 00:05:22.670 
and it's more important that we get a
connection<00:05:20.310> right<00:05:20.610> and<00:05:21.170> that<00:05:22.170> works<00:05:22.380> on<00:05:22.530> the

00:05:22.670 --> 00:05:22.680 
connection right and that works on the

00:05:22.680 --> 00:05:24.350 
connection right and that works on the
bus<00:05:22.830> both<00:05:23.130> sides<00:05:23.370> rather<00:05:23.610> than<00:05:23.850> to<00:05:24.030> aim<00:05:24.120> for<00:05:24.150> a

00:05:24.350 --> 00:05:24.360 
bus both sides rather than to aim for a

00:05:24.360 --> 00:05:25.880 
bus both sides rather than to aim for a
specific<00:05:24.540> date<00:05:24.900> but<00:05:25.380> you<00:05:25.440> have<00:05:25.650> been<00:05:25.770> working

00:05:25.880 --> 00:05:25.890 
specific date but you have been working

00:05:25.890 --> 00:05:27.950 
specific date but you have been working
on<00:05:26.160> it<00:05:26.280> for<00:05:26.310> three<00:05:26.430> years<00:05:26.760> so<00:05:27.360> we're<00:05:27.510> quite<00:05:27.750> far

00:05:27.950 --> 00:05:27.960 
on it for three years so we're quite far

00:05:27.960 --> 00:05:31.100 
on it for three years so we're quite far
along<00:05:28.170> already<00:05:28.500> so<00:05:29.630> good<00:05:30.630> good<00:05:30.870> luck<00:05:30.990> and

00:05:31.100 --> 00:05:31.110 
along already so good good luck and

00:05:31.110 --> 00:05:34.430 
along already so good good luck and
