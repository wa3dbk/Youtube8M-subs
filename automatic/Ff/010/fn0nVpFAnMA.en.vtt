want to open up this package there's a
plastic<00:01:11.400> here<00:01:11.729> I<00:01:11.760> do<00:01:11.880> have<00:01:12.030> a<00:01:12.180> feeling<00:01:12.510> though

00:01:12.620 --> 00:01:12.630 
plastic here I do have a feeling though

00:01:12.630 --> 00:01:15.950 
plastic here I do have a feeling though
that<00:01:13.670> the<00:01:14.670> sparks<00:01:15.090> from<00:01:15.210> a<00:01:15.330> Ferro<00:01:15.540> rod<00:01:15.630> and

00:01:15.950 --> 00:01:15.960 
that the sparks from a Ferro rod and

00:01:15.960 --> 00:01:17.030 
that the sparks from a Ferro rod and
this<00:01:16.020> is<00:01:16.170> the<00:01:16.229> first<00:01:16.409> time<00:01:16.560> I've<00:01:16.619> done<00:01:16.650> it<00:01:16.799> guys

00:01:17.030 --> 00:01:17.040 
this is the first time I've done it guys

00:01:17.040 --> 00:01:19.719 
this is the first time I've done it guys
so<00:01:17.189> you<00:01:17.280> have<00:01:17.400> to<00:01:17.460> see<00:01:17.610> this<00:01:17.759> in<00:01:17.909> real<00:01:18.090> time

00:01:19.719 --> 00:01:19.729 
so you have to see this in real time

00:01:19.729 --> 00:01:21.710 
so you have to see this in real time
probably<00:01:20.729> you're<00:01:20.909> not<00:01:21.030> gonna<00:01:21.150> burn<00:01:21.450> through

00:01:21.710 --> 00:01:21.720 
probably you're not gonna burn through

00:01:21.720 --> 00:01:26.560 
probably you're not gonna burn through
the<00:01:21.810> plastic<00:01:23.780> might<00:01:24.780> though<00:01:24.990> see<00:01:25.530> this<00:01:25.680> try

00:01:26.560 --> 00:01:26.570 
the plastic might though see this try

00:01:26.570 --> 00:01:32.719 
the plastic might though see this try
there<00:01:27.570> we<00:01:27.689> go<00:01:27.810> guys<00:01:29.240> success

00:01:32.719 --> 00:01:32.729 

00:01:32.729 --> 00:01:36.660 

so<00:01:33.729> we<00:01:33.820> got<00:01:33.939> a<00:01:33.969> success<00:01:34.390> with<00:01:34.570> that<00:01:34.600> one<00:01:35.670> blew

00:01:36.660 --> 00:01:36.670 
so we got a success with that one blew

00:01:36.670 --> 00:01:38.160 
so we got a success with that one blew
out<00:01:36.820> cuz<00:01:36.969> a<00:01:37.000> high<00:01:37.210> win<00:01:37.479> which<00:01:37.719> isn't<00:01:37.869> a<00:01:38.020> good

00:01:38.160 --> 00:01:38.170 
out cuz a high win which isn't a good

00:01:38.170 --> 00:01:44.039 
out cuz a high win which isn't a good
sign<00:01:38.409> but<00:01:38.979> hey<00:01:39.130> this<00:01:39.310> is<00:01:39.430> a<00:01:39.460> real<00:01:39.670> test<00:01:43.049> easily

00:01:44.039 --> 00:01:44.049 
sign but hey this is a real test easily

00:01:44.049 --> 00:01:46.050 
sign but hey this is a real test easily
lights<00:01:44.350> back<00:01:44.619> up<00:01:44.649> once<00:01:45.250> the<00:01:45.429> plastic<00:01:45.939> is

00:01:46.050 --> 00:01:46.060 
lights back up once the plastic is

00:01:46.060 --> 00:01:47.910 
lights back up once the plastic is
removed<00:01:46.390> so<00:01:47.170> long<00:01:47.320> as<00:01:47.409> you<00:01:47.469> get<00:01:47.560> a<00:01:47.619> good<00:01:47.799> enough

00:01:49.440 --> 00:01:49.450 
spark that'll melt the plastic you're

00:01:49.450 --> 00:01:51.330 
spark that'll melt the plastic you're
not<00:01:49.570> gonna<00:01:49.689> have<00:01:49.810> any<00:01:49.960> problems<00:01:50.409> I'm<00:01:51.130> gonna<00:01:51.280> go

00:02:16.090 --> 00:02:18.050 
see if this a try to guys whoo I have a
feeling<00:02:16.420> that<00:02:16.480> if<00:02:16.599> we<00:02:16.690> open<00:02:16.870> up<00:02:17.080> the<00:02:17.200> packet

00:02:18.050 --> 00:02:18.060 
feeling that if we open up the packet

00:02:18.060 --> 00:02:20.940 
feeling that if we open up the packet
will<00:02:19.060> be<00:02:19.090> a<00:02:19.269> little<00:02:19.930> bit<00:02:20.019> more<00:02:20.140> successful<00:02:20.349> but

00:02:20.940 --> 00:02:20.950 
will be a little bit more successful but

00:02:20.950 --> 00:02:23.580 
will be a little bit more successful but
you<00:02:21.220> know<00:02:21.489> what<00:02:21.900> let's<00:02:22.900> just<00:02:23.049> do<00:02:23.140> it<00:02:23.170> this<00:02:23.349> way

00:02:23.580 --> 00:02:23.590 
you know what let's just do it this way

00:02:23.590 --> 00:02:37.470 
you know what let's just do it this way
e<00:02:33.390> to<00:02:34.390> e<00:02:34.420> extreme<00:02:34.959> a<00:02:35.200> test<00:02:35.470> addition<00:02:36.299> this<00:02:37.299> is

00:02:37.470 --> 00:02:37.480 
e to e extreme a test addition this is

00:02:37.480 --> 00:02:45.120 
e to e extreme a test addition this is
just<00:02:37.630> ridiculous

00:02:45.120 --> 00:02:45.130 

00:02:45.130 --> 00:02:47.590 

all<00:02:46.130> right<00:02:46.250> well<00:02:46.460> it's<00:02:47.210> not<00:02:47.270> going<00:02:47.420> to<00:02:47.510> light

00:02:47.590 --> 00:02:47.600 
all right well it's not going to light
