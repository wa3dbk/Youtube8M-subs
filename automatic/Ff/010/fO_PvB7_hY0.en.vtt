 spring German studio 

00:00:17.590 --> 00:00:21.460
 daedalic entertainment announced its 

00:00:20.110 --> 00:00:22.780
 the first role-playing game called 

00:00:21.460 --> 00:00:24.970
 blackguards 

00:00:22.780 --> 00:00:27.580
 statement it sounded like thunder 

00:00:24.970 --> 00:00:29.500
 clear sky why the team for many years 

00:00:27.580 --> 00:00:31.270
 creating mostly quests and 

00:00:29.500 --> 00:00:33.760
 adventure games suddenly decided to take on 

00:00:31.270 --> 00:00:35.770
 step by step cast cu cai physicist producer 

00:00:33.760 --> 00:00:37.630
 project explains this quite simply 

00:00:35.770 --> 00:00:39.760
 employees wish the law for 

00:00:37.630 --> 00:00:41.020
 guides adventure they and so on 

00:00:39.760 --> 00:00:43.239
 did the darkness 

00:00:41.020 --> 00:00:45.220
 but in lpg so far only played 

00:00:43.239 --> 00:00:47.560

 the perfect rally fku blog give bellic 

00:00:47.560 --> 00:00:51.490
 entertainment runs a lot of geeks and 

00:00:49.660 --> 00:00:53.440
 on high chairs with experience so 

00:00:51.490 --> 00:00:55.720
 lack of experience should not be a hindrance 

00:00:53.440 --> 00:00:57.640
 in achieving the goal these people 

00:00:55.720 --> 00:00:59.680
 clearly represent what and how they want 

00:00:57.640 --> 00:01:01.720
 so why do what 

00:00:59.680 --> 00:01:03.610
 worry then just about the technical 

00:01:01.720 --> 00:01:05.710
 part of the question but not about 

00:01:03.610 --> 00:01:07.810
 the gameplay although there is no 

00:01:05.710 --> 00:01:10.180
 reasons to believe that the team is already long 

00:01:07.810 --> 00:01:13.740
 years of doing great quests not 

00:01:10.180 --> 00:01:13.740
 can cope with the unity engine 

00:01:16.320 --> 00:01:20.790
 blackguards are based on German 

00:01:18.300 --> 00:01:22.740
 role system das schwarze oog also

 popular in western europe and in 

00:01:24.420 --> 00:01:28.170
 some countries even do

00:01:40.740 --> 00:01:43.740
 another project in the dark universe 

00:01:42.450 --> 00:01:46.140
 eyes action-rpg 

00:01:43.740 --> 00:01:48.150
 demons at such a rate can happen 

00:01:46.140 --> 00:01:50.430
 that soon computer players 

00:01:48.150 --> 00:01:55.500

 project system as you might guess 

00:01:57.259 --> 00:02:01.380
 borrowed from the desktop 

00:01:58.950 --> 00:02:03.570
 original source but still has one 

00:02:01.380 --> 00:02:05.100
 key difference in blackguards 

00:02:03.570 --> 00:02:07.530
 no need to wait for a new level 

00:02:05.100 --> 00:02:09.509
 to improve the parameters of the hero as 

00:02:07.530 --> 00:02:12.000
 completing quests we will earn 

00:02:09.509 --> 00:02:13.350
 Abstract adventure points that and 

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:15.180
 will improve skills and 

00:02:13.350 --> 00:02:16.830
 characteristics of party members when 

00:02:15.180 --> 00:02:18.900
 character creation will be allowed 

00:02:16.830 --> 00:02:21.269
 choose only his appearance from several 

00:02:18.900 --> 00:02:22.320
 ready options gender and belonging to 

00:02:21.269 --> 00:02:24.630
 one of three classes 

00:02:22.320 --> 00:02:26.340
 but in the future as the pumping of heroes 

00:02:24.630 --> 00:02:29.299
 we will be given complete freedom in 

00:02:26.340 --> 00:02:29.299
 character development 

00:02:29.530 --> 00:02:33.459
 blackguards promises to be pretty 

00:02:31.150 --> 00:02:33.970
 grim game take at least a string 

00:02:33.459 --> 00:02:35.950
 plot 

00:02:33.970 --> 00:02:37.990
 Usually they offer us princesses to save 

00:02:35.950 --> 00:02:39.730
 but this time to the beginning of the game the princess 

00:02:37.990 --> 00:02:41.380
 turns out to be brutally murdered 

00:02:39.730 --> 00:02:43.569
 and the main character is her childhood friend 

00:02:41.380 --> 00:02:45.730
 becomes the only suspect 

00:02:43.569 --> 00:02:47.500
 the real culprit of the girl’s death and 

00:02:45.730 --> 00:02:50.350
 was not found therefore scapegoat 

00:02:47.500 --> 00:02:53.080
 we become further classical scheme 

00:02:50.350 --> 00:02:54.540
 court prison escape and now our hero 

00:02:53.080 --> 00:02:57.280
 together with former cellmates 

00:02:54.540 --> 00:02:58.900
 walking around in freedom trying to find and 

00:02:57.280 --> 00:02:59.800
 to punish the death of the lady 

00:02:58.900 --> 00:03:02.470
 royal blood 

00:02:59.800 --> 00:03:04.239
 incidentally return to my good name in the party 

00:03:02.470 --> 00:03:06.310
 same runaway will run with him 

00:03:04.239 --> 00:03:08.530
 criminals with ambiguous biographies 

00:03:06.310 --> 00:03:10.930
 mad yards berserk practitioner 

00:03:08.530 --> 00:03:13.239
 black magic witch thug mercenary with 

00:03:10.930 --> 00:03:13.900
 bloody past and a number of other colorful 

00:03:13.239 --> 00:03:16.450
 characters 

00:03:13.900 --> 00:03:18.880
 We hope that the disclosure of the violence of sex 

00:03:16.450 --> 00:03:20.350
 drug addiction and alcoholism will not turn 

00:03:18.880 --> 00:03:22.330
 blackguards fantasy summary 

00:03:20.350 --> 00:03:26.160
 criminal chronicles and for black humor 

00:03:22.330 --> 00:03:26.160
 there is also a place in the project 

00:03:26.630 --> 00:03:30.590
 the company is divided into five general chapters 

00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:31.940
 the duration of the passage of which 

00:03:30.590 --> 00:03:34.070
 will exceed 40 hours 

00:03:31.940 --> 00:03:35.960
 The main quest of the game is to 

00:03:34.070 --> 00:03:37.550
 search for the killer princess leonor 

00:03:35.960 --> 00:03:39.590
 will intersect with the set 

00:03:37.550 --> 00:03:41.480
 secondary plot threads thanks to 

00:03:39.590 --> 00:03:44.030
 which we can study in more detail 

00:03:41.480 --> 00:03:46.220
 each team member’s past but the most 

00:03:44.030 --> 00:03:47.660
 the main thing is how the execution looks 

00:03:46.220 --> 00:03:49.460
 jobs and here it is 

00:03:47.660 --> 00:03:51.770
 Daedalic style recognizable 

00:03:49.460 --> 00:03:53.750
 unmistakably so as not to be unfounded 

00:03:51.770 --> 00:03:55.940
 give a couple of examples along the way 

00:03:53.750 --> 00:03:57.890
 of passage we will meet dwarf scams 

00:03:55.940 --> 00:04:00.290
 offering to play with him in gambling 

00:03:57.890 --> 00:04:02.210
 the game if a member of our team succeeds 

00:04:00.290 --> 00:04:04.940
 defeat the cunning rogue he will offer 

00:04:02.210 --> 00:04:06.770
 play really agree and for 

00:04:04.940 --> 00:04:08.870
 visits opens closed before 

00:04:06.770 --> 00:04:11.270
 the location of the gameplay is transformed 

00:04:08.870 --> 00:04:13.700
 Camera shows me a level entirely and 

00:04:11.270 --> 00:04:15.830
 some kind of a separate scene and we are looking for 

00:04:13.700 --> 00:04:17.540
 clickable objects we use on them 

00:04:15.830 --> 00:04:19.459
 items from inventory and of course 

00:04:17.540 --> 00:04:21.560
 make numerous decisions 

00:04:19.459 --> 00:04:22.910
 whether to open the chests of the inscriptions on which 

00:04:21.560 --> 00:04:25.310
 promise burglar fast and painful 

00:04:22.910 --> 00:04:26.900
 death look in a couple inside 

00:04:25.310 --> 00:04:28.460
 turn out to be gold coins 

00:04:26.900 --> 00:04:30.230
 but going to the next room with 

00:04:28.460 --> 00:04:32.030
 full of treasure pockets you 

00:04:30.230 --> 00:04:34.160
 find out what's behind every peeled 

00:04:32.030 --> 00:04:36.290
 Chest Local Alarm System 

00:04:34.160 --> 00:04:37.820
 removed the castle from the cage with monsters except 

00:04:36.290 --> 00:04:40.070
 to get out of this room 

00:04:37.820 --> 00:04:42.170
 you need to pick the right one 

00:04:40.070 --> 00:04:44.090
 leverage sequence 

00:04:42.170 --> 00:04:45.740
 clicking release new creatures and 

00:04:44.090 --> 00:04:48.220
 activates arena 

00:04:45.740 --> 00:04:48.220
 traps 

00:04:49.200 --> 00:04:53.400
 here's another side quest we dwell 

00:04:51.780 --> 00:04:55.590
 in the mansion where the guard is going 

00:04:53.400 --> 00:04:57.450
 snitch the local baroness we need 

00:04:55.590 --> 00:04:59.600
 try not to let the ladies die 

00:04:57.450 --> 00:05:01.590
 getting to the gallows in 5 moves 

00:04:59.600 --> 00:05:03.990
 numerous enemies are not easy 

00:05:01.590 --> 00:05:06.180
 they try to kill us, but they hinder us in every way 

00:05:03.990 --> 00:05:08.370
 advance to the goal obstruct 

00:05:06.180 --> 00:05:10.950
 the aisles line up barricades and so 

00:05:08.370 --> 00:05:13.260
 further, a special piquancy of the scene adds 

00:05:10.950 --> 00:05:15.030
 the fact that this is the baroness in her 

00:05:13.260 --> 00:05:19.050
 time was widowed by one of 

00:05:15.030 --> 00:05:21.500
 our team members every fight is 

00:05:19.050 --> 00:05:24.450
 tactical puzzle stated more 

00:05:21.500 --> 00:05:27.060
 180 unique arenas and on these maps 

00:05:24.450 --> 00:05:29.130
 there are interactive objects from banal 

00:05:27.060 --> 00:05:30.990
 boxes and barrels that can be moved 

00:05:29.130 --> 00:05:33.150
 thus blocking the aisles or 

00:05:30.990 --> 00:05:35.280
 hurl at opponents up to much more 

00:05:33.150 --> 00:05:37.530
 interesting things for example from the ceiling in 

00:05:35.280 --> 00:05:39.390
 cave hang stalactites that can 

00:05:37.530 --> 00:05:40.830
 fall down the abs cry of the enemy or sound 

00:05:39.390 --> 00:05:43.200
 accompanying casting spell 

00:05:40.830 --> 00:05:45.210
 true fireball or arrow shoot down 

00:05:43.200 --> 00:05:46.800
 stone icicle does not work but in 

00:05:45.210 --> 00:05:48.720
 chili ny Ulysses tree easily 

00:05:46.800 --> 00:05:50.670
 after which the evil insects will begin 

00:05:48.720 --> 00:05:53.100
 attack all living creatures caught 

00:05:50.670 --> 00:05:55.320
 nearby all characters have 

00:05:53.100 --> 00:05:56.970
 initiative parameter defining 

00:05:55.320 --> 00:05:58.440
 the sequence of their progress and while the knight 

00:05:56.970 --> 00:05:59.520
 chained in iron armor will 

00:05:58.440 --> 00:06:01.770
 swing a two-handed sword 

00:05:59.520 --> 00:06:03.570
 some kind of half-dressed nimble elf with 

00:06:01.770 --> 00:06:05.790
 a pair of daggers have time to hit the enemy 

00:06:03.570 --> 00:06:07.500
 two or three times this way in the belli let 

00:06:05.790 --> 00:06:08.820
 trying to collect a role play from 

00:06:07.500 --> 00:06:11.760
 elements of what they do 

00:06:08.820 --> 00:06:13.620
 best adventure and puzzles and deed 

00:06:11.760 --> 00:06:15.480
 this idea is not as crazy as it can 

00:06:13.620 --> 00:06:17.280
 appear in words anyway 

00:06:15.480 --> 00:06:19.380
 seen live project gameplay 

00:06:17.280 --> 00:06:21.440
 left behind a very pleasant 

00:06:19.380 --> 00:06:21.440
 impression 

00:06:27.330 --> 00:06:32.560
 although step-by-step fighting is perhaps the main and 

00:06:30.460 --> 00:06:34.900
 the most interesting part of the project 

00:06:32.560 --> 00:06:37.660
 many tasks can be completed peacefully 

00:06:34.900 --> 00:06:39.520
 by force of persuasion 

00:06:37.660 --> 00:06:40.990
 or sleight of hand without entering into 

00:06:39.520 --> 00:06:42.910
 armed standoff 

00:06:40.990 --> 00:06:44.590
 on the assurances of the developers each 

00:06:42.910 --> 00:06:46.750
 our decision anyway 

00:06:44.590 --> 00:06:48.970
 will affect the development of the plot and the outcome 

00:06:46.750 --> 00:06:49.570
 further developments well and ending at 

00:06:48.970 --> 00:06:53.080
 blackguards 

00:06:49.570 --> 00:06:54.940
 promise at least 3 release dates 

00:06:53.080 --> 00:06:56.710
 blackguards today are not 

00:06:54.940 --> 00:06:59.950
 even indicated on the main site

00:06:59.950 --> 00:07:03.580
 their Voltaire class called indicative 

00:07:02.140 --> 00:07:05.230
 mid November 

00:07:03.580 --> 00:07:06.910
 but more recently it was announced 

00:07:05.230 --> 00:07:09.460
 postpone release for january next 

00:07:06.910 --> 00:07:12.000
 one way or another , it remains to wait at all 

00:07:09.460 --> 00:07:12.000
 not for long
