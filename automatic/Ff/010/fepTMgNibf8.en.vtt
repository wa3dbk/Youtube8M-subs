00:00:04.280 --> 00:00:04.290 
so welcome to part one of the rendering

00:00:04.290 --> 00:00:06.380 
so welcome to part one of the rendering
technique<00:00:04.740> series<00:00:05.220> and<00:00:05.490> today<00:00:05.850> in<00:00:05.970> part<00:00:06.210> one

00:00:06.380 --> 00:00:06.390 
technique series and today in part one

00:00:06.390 --> 00:00:08.089 
technique series and today in part one
I'm<00:00:06.569> going<00:00:06.750> to<00:00:06.810> look<00:00:06.930> at<00:00:07.109> a<00:00:07.290> camera<00:00:07.649> depth<00:00:07.950> of

00:00:08.089 --> 00:00:08.099 
I'm going to look at a camera depth of

00:00:08.099 --> 00:00:11.330 
I'm going to look at a camera depth of
field<00:00:08.660> so<00:00:09.660> I<00:00:09.690> just<00:00:10.260> put<00:00:10.440> together<00:00:10.559> it<00:00:10.860> a<00:00:10.950> simple

00:00:11.330 --> 00:00:11.340 
field so I just put together it a simple

00:00:11.340 --> 00:00:14.450 
field so I just put together it a simple
scene<00:00:11.610> here<00:00:12.230> I've<00:00:13.230> got<00:00:13.440> a<00:00:13.469> few<00:00:13.620> cylinders<00:00:14.160> it's

00:00:14.450 --> 00:00:14.460 
scene here I've got a few cylinders it's

00:00:14.460 --> 00:00:18.290 
scene here I've got a few cylinders it's
a<00:00:14.639> different<00:00:15.210> distances<00:00:15.719> and<00:00:16.940> usually<00:00:17.940> if<00:00:18.150> we

00:00:18.290 --> 00:00:18.300 
a different distances and usually if we

00:00:18.300 --> 00:00:20.960 
a different distances and usually if we
render<00:00:18.510> a<00:00:18.630> scene<00:00:18.869> like<00:00:19.020> this<00:00:19.640> it<00:00:20.640> kind<00:00:20.880> of

00:00:20.960 --> 00:00:20.970 
render a scene like this it kind of

00:00:20.970 --> 00:00:23.179 
render a scene like this it kind of
render<00:00:21.689> is<00:00:21.779> pretty<00:00:22.020> sharp<00:00:22.320> all<00:00:22.619> the<00:00:22.800> objects

00:00:23.179 --> 00:00:23.189 
render is pretty sharp all the objects

00:00:23.189 --> 00:00:25.759 
render is pretty sharp all the objects
with<00:00:23.519> the<00:00:23.939> same<00:00:24.180> kind<00:00:24.449> of<00:00:24.539> same<00:00:25.289> amount<00:00:25.619> of

00:00:25.759 --> 00:00:25.769 
with the same kind of same amount of

00:00:25.769 --> 00:00:27.710 
with the same kind of same amount of
blur<00:00:26.010> and<00:00:26.250> if<00:00:27.060> you<00:00:27.150> want<00:00:27.330> to<00:00:27.390> use<00:00:27.510> that

00:00:27.710 --> 00:00:27.720 
blur and if you want to use that

00:00:27.720 --> 00:00:30.410 
blur and if you want to use that
fulfilled<00:00:28.109> firstly<00:00:29.010> just<00:00:29.039> make<00:00:29.369> sure<00:00:29.580> you<00:00:30.240> got

00:00:30.410 --> 00:00:30.420 
fulfilled firstly just make sure you got

00:00:30.420 --> 00:00:32.299 
fulfilled firstly just make sure you got
scene<00:00:30.869> camera<00:00:31.320> because<00:00:31.560> the<00:00:31.679> editor<00:00:32.070> camera

00:00:32.299 --> 00:00:32.309 
scene camera because the editor camera

00:00:32.309 --> 00:00:35.270 
scene camera because the editor camera
won't<00:00:32.579> be<00:00:32.759> sufficient<00:00:33.860> like<00:00:34.860> this<00:00:35.070> just

00:00:35.270 --> 00:00:35.280 
won't be sufficient like this just

00:00:35.280 --> 00:00:37.819 
won't be sufficient like this just
create<00:00:35.520> a<00:00:35.579> simple<00:00:35.880> scene<00:00:36.120> camera<00:00:36.329> i<00:00:36.829> parented

00:00:37.819 --> 00:00:37.829 
create a simple scene camera i parented

00:00:37.829 --> 00:00:40.940 
create a simple scene camera i parented
mine<00:00:38.040> to<00:00:38.940> the<00:00:39.059> null<00:00:39.270> and<00:00:39.450> the<00:00:40.230> null<00:00:40.410> sitting<00:00:40.800> on

00:00:40.940 --> 00:00:40.950 
mine to the null and the null sitting on

00:00:40.950 --> 00:00:45.740 
mine to the null and the null sitting on
the<00:00:41.129> kind<00:00:41.489> of<00:00:41.550> the<00:00:41.969> focus<00:00:43.460> so<00:00:44.460> if<00:00:44.910> you<00:00:45.570> want<00:00:45.719> to

00:00:45.740 --> 00:00:45.750 
the kind of the focus so if you want to

00:00:45.750 --> 00:00:48.410 
the kind of the focus so if you want to
activate<00:00:46.260> that<00:00:46.289> for<00:00:46.620> field<00:00:46.860> click<00:00:47.520> here<00:00:47.850> go<00:00:48.000> to

00:00:48.410 --> 00:00:48.420 
activate that for field click here go to

00:00:48.420 --> 00:00:49.970 
activate that for field click here go to
render<00:00:48.660> settings<00:00:49.140> basically<00:00:49.350> and<00:00:49.710> change

00:00:49.970 --> 00:00:49.980 
render settings basically and change

00:00:49.980 --> 00:00:52.970 
render settings basically and change
your<00:00:50.129> render<00:00:50.460> to<00:00:51.180> a<00:00:51.210> physical<00:00:51.809> and<00:00:52.020> this<00:00:52.620> opens

00:00:52.970 --> 00:00:52.980 
your render to a physical and this opens

00:00:52.980 --> 00:00:56.630 
your render to a physical and this opens
up<00:00:53.129> our<00:00:53.539> physical<00:00:54.539> options<00:00:55.440> and<00:00:55.620> you<00:00:56.399> want<00:00:56.550> to

00:00:56.630 --> 00:00:56.640 
up our physical options and you want to

00:00:56.640 --> 00:00:58.520 
up our physical options and you want to
check<00:00:56.850> that<00:00:56.879> for<00:00:57.120> field<00:00:57.539> don't<00:00:57.989> forget<00:00:58.320> to<00:00:58.440> do

00:00:58.520 --> 00:00:58.530 
check that for field don't forget to do

00:00:58.530 --> 00:01:01.250 
check that for field don't forget to do
that<00:00:58.710> and<00:00:59.390> sampling<00:01:00.390> quality<00:01:00.840> I'm<00:01:00.960> just<00:01:01.140> going

00:01:01.250 --> 00:01:01.260 
that and sampling quality I'm just going

00:01:01.260 --> 00:01:04.520 
that and sampling quality I'm just going
to<00:01:01.289> keep<00:01:01.500> at<00:01:01.739> low<00:01:02.070> and<00:01:03.000> if<00:01:03.809> I<00:01:03.899> render<00:01:04.199> the<00:01:04.320> scene

00:01:04.520 --> 00:01:04.530 
to keep at low and if I render the scene

00:01:04.530 --> 00:01:10.070 
to keep at low and if I render the scene
now<00:01:04.769> and<00:01:06.920> this<00:01:07.920> is<00:01:08.100> hard<00:01:08.400> to<00:01:08.580> see<00:01:08.790> but<00:01:09.080> we've

00:01:10.070 --> 00:01:10.080 
now and this is hard to see but we've

00:01:10.080 --> 00:01:12.020 
now and this is hard to see but we've
got<00:01:10.260> slight<00:01:10.770> kind<00:01:11.100> of<00:01:11.159> amount<00:01:11.460> of<00:01:11.580> blur<00:01:11.820> on

00:01:12.020 --> 00:01:12.030 
got slight kind of amount of blur on

00:01:12.030 --> 00:01:13.789 
got slight kind of amount of blur on
this<00:01:12.150> object<00:01:12.360> here<00:01:12.750> so<00:01:13.350> I'm<00:01:13.409> just<00:01:13.439> going<00:01:13.680> to<00:01:13.710> go

00:01:13.789 --> 00:01:13.799 
this object here so I'm just going to go

00:01:13.799 --> 00:01:16.310 
this object here so I'm just going to go
to<00:01:13.860> my<00:01:14.040> camera<00:01:14.360> and<00:01:15.360> click<00:01:15.570> on<00:01:15.689> physical<00:01:16.170> and

00:01:16.310 --> 00:01:16.320 
to my camera and click on physical and

00:01:16.320 --> 00:01:18.770 
to my camera and click on physical and
the<00:01:17.159> f-stop<00:01:17.640> is<00:01:17.850> set<00:01:18.060> to<00:01:18.180> eight<00:01:18.330> which<00:01:18.659> is

00:01:18.770 --> 00:01:18.780 
the f-stop is set to eight which is

00:01:18.780 --> 00:01:21.050 
the f-stop is set to eight which is
quite<00:01:18.990> a<00:01:19.020> generic<00:01:19.470> kind<00:01:19.680> of<00:01:19.799> f-stop<00:01:20.220> and<00:01:20.460> I'm

00:01:21.050 --> 00:01:21.060 
quite a generic kind of f-stop and I'm

00:01:21.060 --> 00:01:23.450 
quite a generic kind of f-stop and I'm
going<00:01:21.240> to<00:01:21.299> set<00:01:21.450> this<00:01:21.600> to<00:01:21.659> one<00:01:22.100> I'm<00:01:23.100> going<00:01:23.250> to<00:01:23.340> re

00:01:23.450 --> 00:01:23.460 
going to set this to one I'm going to re

00:01:23.460 --> 00:01:25.999 
going to set this to one I'm going to re
render<00:01:23.670> the<00:01:23.880> scene<00:01:24.090> and<00:01:24.350> as<00:01:25.350> you<00:01:25.439> can<00:01:25.590> see<00:01:25.770> now

00:01:25.999 --> 00:01:26.009 
render the scene and as you can see now

00:01:26.009 --> 00:01:28.609 
render the scene and as you can see now
that<00:01:26.330> the<00:01:27.330> depth<00:01:27.570> of<00:01:27.720> field<00:01:27.960> effect<00:01:28.320> is<00:01:28.470> are

00:01:28.609 --> 00:01:28.619 
that the depth of field effect is are

00:01:28.619 --> 00:01:33.200 
that the depth of field effect is are
greatly<00:01:28.970> exaggerated<00:01:29.970> you<00:01:30.329> can<00:01:30.479> see<00:01:30.659> it<00:01:32.210> that

00:01:33.200 --> 00:01:33.210 
greatly exaggerated you can see it that

00:01:33.210 --> 00:01:35.420 
greatly exaggerated you can see it that
this<00:01:33.450> objects<00:01:34.079> InFocus<00:01:34.650> and<00:01:34.829> these<00:01:34.979> objects

00:01:35.420 --> 00:01:35.430 
this objects InFocus and these objects

00:01:35.430 --> 00:01:38.569 
this objects InFocus and these objects
are<00:01:35.579> out<00:01:35.880> of<00:01:35.909> focus<00:01:36.299> and<00:01:36.979> if<00:01:37.979> you<00:01:38.100> really<00:01:38.369> want

00:01:38.569 --> 00:01:38.579 
are out of focus and if you really want

00:01:38.579 --> 00:01:41.840 
are out of focus and if you really want
you<00:01:38.670> can<00:01:38.820> go<00:01:38.909> to<00:01:38.939> custom<00:01:39.509> and<00:01:40.100> then<00:01:41.100> sometimes

00:01:41.840 --> 00:01:41.850 
you can go to custom and then sometimes

00:01:41.850 --> 00:01:43.010 
you can go to custom and then sometimes
you<00:01:41.939> have<00:01:42.060> to<00:01:42.150> click<00:01:42.360> here<00:01:42.600> it's<00:01:42.810> going<00:01:42.960> to

00:01:43.010 --> 00:01:43.020 
you have to click here it's going to

00:01:43.020 --> 00:01:45.530 
you have to click here it's going to
make<00:01:43.799> it<00:01:44.009> activate<00:01:44.700> it's<00:01:45.030> kind<00:01:45.180> of<00:01:45.210> strange

00:01:45.530 --> 00:01:45.540 
make it activate it's kind of strange

00:01:45.540 --> 00:01:47.870 
make it activate it's kind of strange
I'm<00:01:45.930> just<00:01:46.380> going<00:01:46.500> to<00:01:46.560> set<00:01:46.710> it<00:01:46.829> to<00:01:46.860> point<00:01:47.670> one

00:01:47.870 --> 00:01:47.880 
I'm just going to set it to point one

00:01:47.880 --> 00:01:51.770 
I'm just going to set it to point one
which<00:01:48.360> is<00:01:48.540> pretty<00:01:49.049> extreme<00:01:49.500> and<00:01:50.570> as<00:01:51.570> you<00:01:51.659> can

00:01:51.770 --> 00:01:51.780 
which is pretty extreme and as you can

00:01:51.780 --> 00:01:53.840 
which is pretty extreme and as you can
see<00:01:51.990> that<00:01:52.170> gives<00:01:52.320> us<00:01:52.500> a<00:01:52.619> very<00:01:52.860> exaggerated

00:01:53.840 --> 00:01:53.850 
see that gives us a very exaggerated

00:01:53.850 --> 00:01:56.719 
see that gives us a very exaggerated
effect<00:01:54.270> and<00:01:54.740> one<00:01:55.740> thing<00:01:55.920> you<00:01:56.009> might<00:01:56.130> notice<00:01:56.340> is

00:01:56.719 --> 00:01:56.729 
effect and one thing you might notice is

00:01:56.729 --> 00:01:59.510 
effect and one thing you might notice is
the<00:01:56.939> graininess<00:01:57.360> on<00:01:57.869> the<00:01:58.350> objects<00:01:58.740> so<00:01:59.070> if<00:01:59.369> you

00:01:59.510 --> 00:01:59.520 
the graininess on the objects so if you

00:01:59.520 --> 00:02:02.359 
the graininess on the objects so if you
want<00:01:59.670> to<00:01:59.759> increase<00:02:00.060> the<00:02:00.210> sampling<00:02:01.070> go<00:02:02.070> back<00:02:02.250> to

00:02:02.359 --> 00:02:02.369 
want to increase the sampling go back to

00:02:02.369 --> 00:02:03.950 
want to increase the sampling go back to
your<00:02:02.490> physical<00:02:03.030> settings<00:02:03.420> and<00:02:03.630> set<00:02:03.840> the

00:02:03.950 --> 00:02:03.960 
your physical settings and set the

00:02:03.960 --> 00:02:06.499 
your physical settings and set the
sampling<00:02:04.320> quality<00:02:04.799> to<00:02:05.040> high<00:02:05.280> and<00:02:05.549> obviously

00:02:06.499 --> 00:02:06.509 
sampling quality to high and obviously

00:02:06.509 --> 00:02:07.850 
sampling quality to high and obviously
this<00:02:06.719> is<00:02:06.869> going<00:02:06.960> to<00:02:07.049> increase<00:02:07.229> render<00:02:07.680> time

00:02:07.850 --> 00:02:07.860 
this is going to increase render time

00:02:07.860 --> 00:02:08.889 
this is going to increase render time
but

00:02:08.889 --> 00:02:08.899 
but

00:02:08.899 --> 00:02:11.300 
but
it's<00:02:09.899> going<00:02:10.079> to<00:02:10.140> give<00:02:10.289> a<00:02:10.319> very<00:02:10.649> kind<00:02:10.920> of<00:02:11.009> smooth

00:02:11.300 --> 00:02:11.310 
it's going to give a very kind of smooth

00:02:11.310 --> 00:02:17.660 
it's going to give a very kind of smooth
effect<00:02:12.439> I'll<00:02:13.439> just<00:02:13.739> let<00:02:13.859> that<00:02:13.920> render<00:02:14.780> so<00:02:16.670> a

00:02:17.660 --> 00:02:17.670 
effect I'll just let that render so a

00:02:17.670 --> 00:02:20.089 
effect I'll just let that render so a
question<00:02:18.120> what<00:02:18.510> you<00:02:18.689> might<00:02:18.870> have<00:02:19.049> is<00:02:19.260> that<00:02:19.290> how

00:02:20.089 --> 00:02:20.099 
question what you might have is that how

00:02:20.099 --> 00:02:23.229 
question what you might have is that how
do<00:02:20.159> we<00:02:20.340> pick<00:02:20.549> objects<00:02:21.209> to<00:02:21.329> kind<00:02:21.480> of<00:02:21.510> focus<00:02:21.780> on

00:02:23.229 --> 00:02:23.239 
do we pick objects to kind of focus on

00:02:23.239 --> 00:02:26.929 
do we pick objects to kind of focus on
so<00:02:24.239> I'm<00:02:24.329> just<00:02:24.450> going<00:02:24.569> to<00:02:24.629> stop<00:02:24.989> that<00:02:25.170> and<00:02:25.939> there

00:02:26.929 --> 00:02:26.939 
so I'm just going to stop that and there

00:02:26.939 --> 00:02:29.000 
so I'm just going to stop that and there
well<00:02:27.870> you<00:02:28.049> could<00:02:28.230> firstly<00:02:28.650> you<00:02:28.739> can<00:02:28.799> do<00:02:28.950> it

00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:29.010 
well you could firstly you can do it

00:02:29.010 --> 00:02:31.039 
well you could firstly you can do it
manually<00:02:29.340> so<00:02:29.640> if<00:02:30.180> we<00:02:30.359> just<00:02:30.510> go<00:02:30.569> to<00:02:30.720> the<00:02:30.810> top

00:02:31.039 --> 00:02:31.049 
manually so if we just go to the top

00:02:31.049 --> 00:02:33.530 
manually so if we just go to the top
view<00:02:31.230> here<00:02:31.650> you<00:02:32.489> can<00:02:32.670> see<00:02:32.849> that<00:02:33.030> this<00:02:33.180> plane<00:02:33.510> is

00:02:33.530 --> 00:02:33.540 
view here you can see that this plane is

00:02:33.540 --> 00:02:36.199 
view here you can see that this plane is
kind<00:02:33.930> of<00:02:33.959> sitting<00:02:34.200> roughly<00:02:34.769> on<00:02:35.000> where<00:02:36.000> those

00:02:36.199 --> 00:02:36.209 
kind of sitting roughly on where those

00:02:36.209 --> 00:02:39.979 
kind of sitting roughly on where those
middle<00:02:37.170> two<00:02:37.200> cylinders<00:02:37.829> are<00:02:38.069> so<00:02:39.030> let's<00:02:39.389> say<00:02:39.510> we

00:02:39.979 --> 00:02:39.989 
middle two cylinders are so let's say we

00:02:39.989 --> 00:02:42.009 
middle two cylinders are so let's say we
want<00:02:40.170> to<00:02:40.260> focus<00:02:40.439> on<00:02:40.680> this<00:02:40.799> front<00:02:41.099> cylinder

00:02:42.009 --> 00:02:42.019 
want to focus on this front cylinder

00:02:42.019 --> 00:02:44.360 
want to focus on this front cylinder
just<00:02:43.019> click<00:02:43.230> on<00:02:43.349> the<00:02:43.439> camera<00:02:43.799> and<00:02:44.189> go<00:02:44.310> to

00:02:44.360 --> 00:02:44.370 
just click on the camera and go to

00:02:44.370 --> 00:02:47.809 
just click on the camera and go to
object<00:02:44.689> the<00:02:45.689> object<00:02:45.900> tab<00:02:46.319> and<00:02:46.500> just<00:02:47.010> manually

00:02:47.809 --> 00:02:47.819 
object the object tab and just manually

00:02:47.819 --> 00:02:50.569 
object the object tab and just manually
pull<00:02:48.359> back<00:02:48.599> the<00:02:48.810> focus<00:02:49.169> distance<00:02:49.430> until<00:02:50.430> it's

00:02:50.569 --> 00:02:50.579 
pull back the focus distance until it's

00:02:50.579 --> 00:02:53.809 
pull back the focus distance until it's
kind<00:02:50.730> of<00:02:50.790> roughly<00:02:51.209> on<00:02:51.419> the<00:02:51.599> same<00:02:52.069> axis<00:02:53.069> as<00:02:53.099> our

00:02:53.809 --> 00:02:53.819 
kind of roughly on the same axis as our

00:02:53.819 --> 00:02:57.259 
kind of roughly on the same axis as our
front<00:02:54.419> cylinder<00:02:54.629> and<00:02:55.489> if<00:02:56.489> I<00:02:56.579> rerender<00:02:57.180> the

00:02:57.259 --> 00:02:57.269 
front cylinder and if I rerender the

00:02:57.269 --> 00:03:01.479 
front cylinder and if I rerender the
scene<00:02:57.480> now<00:02:59.329> so<00:03:00.329> I'm<00:03:00.450> just<00:03:00.510> going<00:03:00.720> to<00:03:00.780> reduce<00:03:01.019> my

00:03:01.479 --> 00:03:01.489 
scene now so I'm just going to reduce my

00:03:01.489 --> 00:03:03.860 
scene now so I'm just going to reduce my
sampling<00:03:02.489> quality<00:03:02.909> to<00:03:03.060> low<00:03:03.209> to<00:03:03.510> get<00:03:03.599> a<00:03:03.659> quick

00:03:03.860 --> 00:03:03.870 
sampling quality to low to get a quick

00:03:03.870 --> 00:03:08.210 
sampling quality to low to get a quick
update<00:03:06.019> now<00:03:07.019> we<00:03:07.079> can<00:03:07.439> see<00:03:07.620> that<00:03:07.769> the<00:03:07.889> front

00:03:08.210 --> 00:03:08.220 
update now we can see that the front

00:03:08.220 --> 00:03:11.030 
update now we can see that the front
cylinder<00:03:08.849> is<00:03:09.269> in<00:03:09.329> focus<00:03:09.720> and<00:03:10.139> everything<00:03:10.620> else

00:03:11.030 --> 00:03:11.040 
cylinder is in focus and everything else

00:03:11.040 --> 00:03:14.689 
cylinder is in focus and everything else
is<00:03:11.189> out<00:03:11.340> of<00:03:11.370> focus<00:03:12.109> alternatively<00:03:13.400> we<00:03:14.400> can<00:03:14.579> now

00:03:14.689 --> 00:03:14.699 
is out of focus alternatively we can now

00:03:14.699 --> 00:03:16.640 
is out of focus alternatively we can now
go<00:03:14.849> to<00:03:14.879> camera<00:03:15.239> and<00:03:15.540> we<00:03:15.900> can<00:03:16.049> use<00:03:16.229> this<00:03:16.349> picker

00:03:16.640 --> 00:03:16.650 
go to camera and we can use this picker

00:03:16.650 --> 00:03:19.339 
go to camera and we can use this picker
tool<00:03:16.979> to<00:03:17.340> actually<00:03:17.729> select<00:03:17.940> an<00:03:18.269> object<00:03:18.359> to

00:03:19.339 --> 00:03:19.349 
tool to actually select an object to

00:03:19.349 --> 00:03:21.710 
tool to actually select an object to
focus<00:03:19.739> on<00:03:19.919> so<00:03:20.220> just<00:03:20.459> watch<00:03:20.639> this<00:03:20.879> top<00:03:21.090> view<00:03:21.120> as

00:03:21.710 --> 00:03:21.720 
focus on so just watch this top view as

00:03:21.720 --> 00:03:24.050 
focus on so just watch this top view as
I<00:03:21.840> do<00:03:21.900> that<00:03:22.519> I'm<00:03:23.519> just<00:03:23.609> going<00:03:23.790> to<00:03:23.819> click<00:03:24.030> on

00:03:24.050 --> 00:03:24.060 
I do that I'm just going to click on

00:03:24.060 --> 00:03:26.420 
I do that I'm just going to click on
this<00:03:24.269> middle<00:03:24.479> one<00:03:24.690> and<00:03:24.959> as<00:03:25.739> you<00:03:25.949> can<00:03:26.069> see<00:03:26.280> it's

00:03:26.420 --> 00:03:26.430 
this middle one and as you can see it's

00:03:26.430 --> 00:03:28.969 
this middle one and as you can see it's
automatically<00:03:27.180> adjusted<00:03:28.049> to<00:03:28.169> focus<00:03:28.530> distance

00:03:28.969 --> 00:03:28.979 
automatically adjusted to focus distance

00:03:28.979 --> 00:03:33.559 
automatically adjusted to focus distance
now<00:03:29.909> now<00:03:30.329> if<00:03:30.479> we<00:03:30.659> hit<00:03:30.780> render<00:03:32.150> the<00:03:33.150> middle<00:03:33.389> ones

00:03:33.559 --> 00:03:33.569 
now now if we hit render the middle ones

00:03:33.569 --> 00:03:35.899 
now now if we hit render the middle ones
in<00:03:33.720> focus<00:03:34.079> and<00:03:34.340> I'm<00:03:35.340> just<00:03:35.459> going<00:03:35.609> to<00:03:35.699> try<00:03:35.849> the

00:03:35.899 --> 00:03:35.909 
in focus and I'm just going to try the

00:03:35.909 --> 00:03:41.780 
in focus and I'm just going to try the
back<00:03:36.180> one<00:03:38.090> let's<00:03:39.090> see<00:03:39.239> what<00:03:39.389> happens<00:03:40.519> now<00:03:41.519> this

00:03:41.780 --> 00:03:41.790 
back one let's see what happens now this

00:03:41.790 --> 00:03:47.780 
back one let's see what happens now this
cylinder<00:03:42.120> is<00:03:42.299> in<00:03:42.419> focus<00:03:42.599> and<00:03:44.750> then<00:03:46.370> lastly<00:03:47.370> one

00:03:47.780 --> 00:03:47.790 
cylinder is in focus and then lastly one

00:03:47.790 --> 00:03:49.909 
cylinder is in focus and then lastly one
thing<00:03:48.000> to<00:03:48.120> remember<00:03:48.389> is<00:03:48.629> that<00:03:48.659> depth<00:03:49.470> of<00:03:49.620> field

00:03:49.909 --> 00:03:49.919 
thing to remember is that depth of field

00:03:49.919 --> 00:03:53.509 
thing to remember is that depth of field
is<00:03:50.209> very<00:03:51.209> sensitive<00:03:51.750> to<00:03:52.019> scale<00:03:52.349> so<00:03:53.069> these<00:03:53.310> are

00:03:53.509 --> 00:03:53.519 
is very sensitive to scale so these are

00:03:53.519 --> 00:03:56.179 
is very sensitive to scale so these are
objects<00:03:54.060> are<00:03:54.239> roughly<00:03:54.569> am<00:03:54.780> kind<00:03:55.769> of<00:03:55.829> ten

00:03:56.179 --> 00:03:56.189 
objects are roughly am kind of ten

00:03:56.189 --> 00:03:58.699 
objects are roughly am kind of ten
centimeters<00:03:56.459> by<00:03:57.150> sixty<00:03:57.840> centimeters<00:03:58.439> high

00:03:58.699 --> 00:03:58.709 
centimeters by sixty centimeters high

00:03:58.709 --> 00:04:01.069 
centimeters by sixty centimeters high
which<00:03:59.549> means<00:03:59.760> they're<00:04:00.030> the<00:04:00.150> size<00:04:00.329> of<00:04:00.569> a<00:04:00.780> kind

00:04:01.069 --> 00:04:01.079 
which means they're the size of a kind

00:04:01.079 --> 00:04:05.509 
which means they're the size of a kind
of<00:04:01.139> large<00:04:01.680> cardboard<00:04:02.159> box<00:04:02.459> maybe<00:04:03.739> but<00:04:04.739> if<00:04:05.280> we

00:04:05.509 --> 00:04:05.519 
of large cardboard box maybe but if we

00:04:05.519 --> 00:04:06.770 
of large cardboard box maybe but if we
were<00:04:05.639> to<00:04:05.699> make<00:04:05.909> this<00:04:06.090> scene<00:04:06.329> as<00:04:06.479> big<00:04:06.659> as

00:04:06.770 --> 00:04:06.780 
were to make this scene as big as

00:04:06.780 --> 00:04:09.189 
were to make this scene as big as
buildings<00:04:07.280> I'm<00:04:08.280> just<00:04:08.430> going<00:04:08.549> to<00:04:08.579> go<00:04:08.699> to<00:04:08.729> edit

00:04:09.189 --> 00:04:09.199 
buildings I'm just going to go to edit

00:04:09.199 --> 00:04:12.740 
buildings I'm just going to go to edit
scale<00:04:10.199> project<00:04:10.769> and<00:04:10.979> I'm<00:04:11.939> going<00:04:12.180> to<00:04:12.239> convert

00:04:12.740 --> 00:04:12.750 
scale project and I'm going to convert

00:04:12.750 --> 00:04:16.940 
scale project and I'm going to convert
one<00:04:13.109> centimeter<00:04:13.680> to<00:04:14.489> a<00:04:14.519> say<00:04:15.090> ten<00:04:15.659> meters<00:04:16.079> so

00:04:16.940 --> 00:04:16.950 
one centimeter to a say ten meters so

00:04:16.950 --> 00:04:19.759 
one centimeter to a say ten meters so
that's<00:04:17.070> a<00:04:17.250> thousand<00:04:17.729> times<00:04:17.909> bigger

00:04:19.759 --> 00:04:19.769 
that's a thousand times bigger

00:04:19.769 --> 00:04:24.290 
that's a thousand times bigger
and<00:04:19.859> the<00:04:20.609> cameras<00:04:20.940> disappeared<00:04:22.880> just<00:04:23.880> cool

00:04:24.290 --> 00:04:24.300 
and the cameras disappeared just cool

00:04:24.300 --> 00:04:32.120 
and the cameras disappeared just cool
back<00:04:27.740> I'm<00:04:28.740> sure<00:04:29.009> what<00:04:29.250> happened<00:04:29.610> here<00:04:30.860> yeah<00:04:31.860> I

00:04:32.120 --> 00:04:32.130 
back I'm sure what happened here yeah I

00:04:32.130 --> 00:04:36.219 
back I'm sure what happened here yeah I
think<00:04:32.370> the<00:04:32.460> actual<00:04:33.500> clipping<00:04:34.500> distance<00:04:34.919> is<00:04:35.130> a

00:04:36.219 --> 00:04:36.229 
think the actual clipping distance is a

00:04:36.229 --> 00:04:42.879 
think the actual clipping distance is a
too<00:04:37.229> much<00:04:38.660> adjust<00:04:39.660> the<00:04:39.780> clipping<00:04:40.259> distance<00:04:41.630> or

00:04:42.879 --> 00:04:42.889 
too much adjust the clipping distance or

00:04:42.889 --> 00:04:48.830 
too much adjust the clipping distance or
clipping<00:04:43.889> I<00:04:46.819> think<00:04:47.819> I<00:04:47.910> scale<00:04:48.180> it<00:04:48.330> too<00:04:48.479> big<00:04:48.720> so

00:04:48.830 --> 00:04:48.840 
clipping I think I scale it too big so

00:04:48.840 --> 00:04:50.029 
clipping I think I scale it too big so
I'm<00:04:48.930> just<00:04:49.020> going<00:04:49.139> to<00:04:49.229> scale<00:04:49.410> it<00:04:49.590> down<00:04:49.620> slightly

00:04:50.029 --> 00:04:50.039 
I'm just going to scale it down slightly

00:04:50.039 --> 00:04:55.149 
I'm just going to scale it down slightly
then<00:04:50.580> I<00:04:50.669> was<00:04:50.789> a<00:04:50.819> bit<00:04:50.970> extreme<00:04:51.150> maybe<00:04:51.569> so<00:04:52.470> say

00:04:55.149 --> 00:04:55.159 

00:04:55.159 --> 00:04:59.059 

one<00:04:56.159> meter<00:04:56.400> down<00:04:56.849> to<00:04:57.120> ten<00:04:57.509> centimeters<00:04:58.069> there

00:04:59.059 --> 00:04:59.069 
one meter down to ten centimeters there

00:04:59.069 --> 00:05:01.510 
one meter down to ten centimeters there
we<00:04:59.220> go

00:05:01.510 --> 00:05:01.520 

00:05:01.520 --> 00:05:03.800 

so<00:05:02.520> that's<00:05:02.699> a<00:05:02.789> hundred<00:05:03.150> times<00:05:03.300> bigger<00:05:03.569> than

00:05:03.800 --> 00:05:03.810 
so that's a hundred times bigger than

00:05:03.810 --> 00:05:07.629 
so that's a hundred times bigger than
the<00:05:03.960> original<00:05:04.020> and<00:05:04.699> if<00:05:05.699> I<00:05:05.849> hit<00:05:06.030> render<00:05:06.539> now

00:05:07.629 --> 00:05:07.639 
the original and if I hit render now

00:05:07.639 --> 00:05:09.800 
the original and if I hit render now
even<00:05:08.639> though<00:05:08.759> we've<00:05:08.940> got<00:05:08.970> the<00:05:09.210> depth<00:05:09.389> of<00:05:09.569> field

00:05:09.800 --> 00:05:09.810 
even though we've got the depth of field

00:05:09.810 --> 00:05:12.680 
even though we've got the depth of field
applied<00:05:10.080> we're<00:05:10.590> not<00:05:10.710> seeing<00:05:11.490> the<00:05:11.669> effect<00:05:12.000> as

00:05:12.680 --> 00:05:12.690 
applied we're not seeing the effect as

00:05:12.690 --> 00:05:15.170 
applied we're not seeing the effect as
we<00:05:12.900> did<00:05:13.050> before<00:05:13.229> so<00:05:13.830> we<00:05:14.669> should<00:05:14.849> be<00:05:14.970> able<00:05:15.120> to

00:05:15.170 --> 00:05:15.180 
we did before so we should be able to

00:05:15.180 --> 00:05:17.899 
we did before so we should be able to
see<00:05:15.889> some<00:05:16.889> kind<00:05:17.009> of<00:05:17.099> debt<00:05:17.250> for<00:05:17.430> focus<00:05:17.789> effect

00:05:17.899 --> 00:05:17.909 
see some kind of debt for focus effect

00:05:17.909 --> 00:05:20.480 
see some kind of debt for focus effect
going<00:05:18.360> on<00:05:18.509> because<00:05:19.470> it's<00:05:19.680> a<00:05:19.860> focus<00:05:20.280> on<00:05:20.400> these

00:05:20.480 --> 00:05:20.490 
going on because it's a focus on these

00:05:20.490 --> 00:05:25.279 
going on because it's a focus on these
middle<00:05:20.849> cylinders<00:05:21.330> here<00:05:22.190> but<00:05:23.840> the<00:05:24.840> effect<00:05:25.139> is

00:05:25.279 --> 00:05:25.289 
middle cylinders here but the effect is

00:05:25.289 --> 00:05:27.529 
middle cylinders here but the effect is
greatly<00:05:25.800> reduced<00:05:26.130> that's<00:05:26.820> due<00:05:27.030> to<00:05:27.150> the<00:05:27.270> scale

00:05:27.529 --> 00:05:27.539 
greatly reduced that's due to the scale

00:05:27.539 --> 00:05:30.800 
greatly reduced that's due to the scale
being<00:05:27.900> a<00:05:28.050> hundred<00:05:28.380> times<00:05:28.530> bigger<00:05:28.800> and<00:05:29.659> if<00:05:30.659> we

00:05:30.800 --> 00:05:30.810 
being a hundred times bigger and if we

00:05:30.810 --> 00:05:33.649 
being a hundred times bigger and if we
look<00:05:30.990> at<00:05:31.110> the<00:05:31.259> cylinder<00:05:31.710> dimensions<00:05:32.659> the

00:05:33.649 --> 00:05:33.659 
look at the cylinder dimensions the

00:05:33.659 --> 00:05:37.070 
look at the cylinder dimensions the
radius<00:05:34.110> is<00:05:34.380> one<00:05:35.210> thousand<00:05:36.210> centimeters<00:05:36.840> so

00:05:37.070 --> 00:05:37.080 
radius is one thousand centimeters so

00:05:37.080 --> 00:05:41.209 
radius is one thousand centimeters so
it's<00:05:37.229> like<00:05:37.349> 10<00:05:37.620> meters<00:05:37.800> wide<00:05:38.280> and<00:05:39.860> 60<00:05:40.860> meters

00:05:41.209 --> 00:05:41.219 
it's like 10 meters wide and 60 meters

00:05:41.219 --> 00:05:41.719 
it's like 10 meters wide and 60 meters
high

00:05:41.719 --> 00:05:41.729 
high

00:05:41.729 --> 00:05:43.879 
high
so<00:05:41.940> almost<00:05:42.270> the<00:05:42.419> size<00:05:42.599> of<00:05:42.810> a<00:05:42.900> building<00:05:43.139> I'd<00:05:43.590> say

00:05:43.879 --> 00:05:43.889 
so almost the size of a building I'd say

00:05:43.889 --> 00:05:50.089 
so almost the size of a building I'd say
and<00:05:45.020> that's<00:05:46.020> why<00:05:46.340> we're<00:05:47.340> not<00:05:47.550> getting<00:05:47.729> a<00:05:49.099> depth

00:05:50.089 --> 00:05:50.099 
and that's why we're not getting a depth

00:05:50.099 --> 00:05:51.980 
and that's why we're not getting a depth
of<00:05:50.219> field<00:05:50.460> effect<00:05:50.819> so<00:05:51.000> easily<00:05:51.180> now<00:05:51.569> maybe

00:05:51.980 --> 00:05:51.990 
of field effect so easily now maybe

00:05:51.990 --> 00:05:53.930 
of field effect so easily now maybe
maybe<00:05:52.560> if<00:05:52.710> we<00:05:52.860> come<00:05:53.039> very<00:05:53.219> close<00:05:53.460> to<00:05:53.580> one<00:05:53.849> of

00:05:53.930 --> 00:05:53.940 
maybe if we come very close to one of

00:05:53.940 --> 00:06:00.170 
maybe if we come very close to one of
these<00:05:56.270> and<00:05:57.530> now<00:05:58.530> if<00:05:59.130> you<00:05:59.280> get<00:05:59.460> real<00:05:59.699> close<00:05:59.729> to

00:06:00.170 --> 00:06:00.180 
these and now if you get real close to

00:06:00.180 --> 00:06:02.480 
these and now if you get real close to
the<00:06:00.300> object<00:06:00.419> we<00:06:01.229> can<00:06:01.380> start<00:06:01.710> to<00:06:01.830> see<00:06:02.009> the<00:06:02.190> depth

00:06:02.480 --> 00:06:02.490 
the object we can start to see the depth

00:06:02.490 --> 00:06:05.779 
the object we can start to see the depth
of<00:06:02.639> field<00:06:02.880> effect<00:06:03.419> kicking<00:06:03.840> in<00:06:04.580> so<00:06:05.580> I'm<00:06:05.639> just

00:06:05.779 --> 00:06:05.789 
of field effect kicking in so I'm just

00:06:05.789 --> 00:06:07.339 
of field effect kicking in so I'm just
going<00:06:05.909> to<00:06:05.940> get<00:06:06.090> even<00:06:06.240> closer<00:06:06.659> maybe<00:06:07.110> about

00:06:07.339 --> 00:06:07.349 
going to get even closer maybe about

00:06:07.349 --> 00:06:12.469 
going to get even closer maybe about
here<00:06:09.080> and<00:06:10.080> now<00:06:10.590> we<00:06:10.650> can<00:06:10.889> see<00:06:11.099> it<00:06:11.219> but<00:06:11.759> we<00:06:12.330> have

00:06:12.469 --> 00:06:12.479 
here and now we can see it but we have

00:06:12.479 --> 00:06:15.080 
here and now we can see it but we have
to<00:06:12.509> get<00:06:12.719> real<00:06:13.050> close<00:06:13.080> before<00:06:13.949> it<00:06:14.610> starts<00:06:14.969> kind

00:06:15.080 --> 00:06:15.090 
to get real close before it starts kind

00:06:15.090 --> 00:06:18.320 
to get real close before it starts kind
of<00:06:15.210> showing<00:06:16.069> so<00:06:17.069> yeah<00:06:17.370> just<00:06:17.639> remember<00:06:17.789> scale

00:06:18.320 --> 00:06:18.330 
of showing so yeah just remember scale

00:06:18.330 --> 00:06:20.300 
of showing so yeah just remember scale
as<00:06:18.599> a<00:06:18.630> factor<00:06:19.110> when<00:06:19.620> it<00:06:19.650> comes<00:06:19.740> to<00:06:19.949> that<00:06:20.130> for

00:06:20.300 --> 00:06:20.310 
as a factor when it comes to that for

00:06:20.310 --> 00:06:23.779 
as a factor when it comes to that for
field<00:06:20.520> and<00:06:21.830> I'm<00:06:22.830> just<00:06:22.979> going<00:06:23.099> to<00:06:23.190> wrap<00:06:23.400> up<00:06:23.580> this

00:06:23.779 --> 00:06:23.789 
field and I'm just going to wrap up this

00:06:23.789 --> 00:06:26.360 
field and I'm just going to wrap up this
first<00:06:23.849> part
