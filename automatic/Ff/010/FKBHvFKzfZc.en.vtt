00:00:05.240 --> 00:00:10.679
 in the line of equipment f there is g from the known 

00:00:08.519 --> 00:00:12.210
 English company to the orcs in the present 

00:00:10.679 --> 00:00:15.120
 moment there are three models of integral 

00:00:12.210 --> 00:00:17.039
 amplifiers among them model a 19 

00:00:15.120 --> 00:00:19.350
 is junior as hierarchy 

00:00:17.039 --> 00:00:21.859
 so in age she appeared completely 

00:00:19.350 --> 00:00:25.650
 recently and today we have our video review 

00:00:21.859 --> 00:00:28.170
 if you compare the exterior of a 19 amp 8 

00:00:25.650 --> 00:00:30.330
 the series we find the least difference 

00:00:28.170 --> 00:00:33.090
 cambridge company can take care 

00:00:30.330 --> 00:00:34.760
 tradition the front panel is made of 

00:00:33.090 --> 00:00:37.620
 pretty thick duralumin plate 

00:00:34.760 --> 00:00:39.420
 the regulator is also metallic and in general 

00:00:37.620 --> 00:00:41.850
 plastic construction parts 

00:00:39.420 --> 00:00:44.100
 the amplifier does not see the green display 

00:00:41.850 --> 00:00:45.809
 Someone seems old-fashioned but he 

00:00:44.100 --> 00:00:48.870
 fits well with corporate design 

00:00:45.809 --> 00:00:52.110
 buttons look rustic but in 

00:00:48.870 --> 00:00:53.219
 they are quite convenient to use linear 

00:00:52.110 --> 00:00:55.590
 6 inputs here 

00:00:53.219 --> 00:00:58.230
 there is also a phono stage for heads 

00:00:55.590 --> 00:01:00.239
 Type m &amp; m on the front panel we see 

00:00:58.230 --> 00:01:02.010
 one more move intended for 

00:01:00.239 --> 00:01:05.729
 quick connect player or 

00:01:02.010 --> 00:01:08.040
 the smartphone of this whole entry into 8 more 

00:01:05.729 --> 00:01:10.170
 happens only at and in receivers it is not 

00:01:08.040 --> 00:01:12.270
 any presence of preamp output 

00:01:10.170 --> 00:01:15.570
 will allow to connect additional 

00:01:12.270 --> 00:01:17.400
 power amplifier makers a 19 

00:01:15.570 --> 00:01:18.180
 especially proud of the amplifier for 

00:01:17.400 --> 00:01:20.430
 headphone 

00:01:18.180 --> 00:01:21.570
 which was redesigned to reflect 

00:01:20.430 --> 00:01:25.189
 growing demands for 

00:01:21.570 --> 00:01:25.189
 high quality sound and 

00:01:25.220 --> 00:01:29.520
 really sound in headphones 

00:01:26.909 --> 00:01:31.920
 very detailed and although not without 

00:01:29.520 --> 00:01:35.579
 some detachment output 

00:01:31.920 --> 00:01:39.570
 power and 1950 that load 8 ohms or 

00:01:35.579 --> 00:01:41.880
 90 watts per 4 ohm is a bit however for 

00:01:39.570 --> 00:01:44.250
 small and medium rooms are enough 

00:01:41.880 --> 00:01:46.470
 for large rooms can be attracted to 

00:01:44.250 --> 00:01:49.380
 work extra power amplifier 

00:01:46.470 --> 00:01:50.500
 immediately after the first start from 19 

00:01:49.380 --> 00:01:52.930
 seemed to him 

00:01:50.500 --> 00:01:54.700
 mechanically however as it warms up 

00:01:52.930 --> 00:01:56.800
 melancholic and retreated before 

00:01:54.700 --> 00:01:59.800
 musicality amplifier really 

00:01:56.800 --> 00:02:02.290
 it became interesting to listen to him 

00:01:59.800 --> 00:02:04.300
 lack of that pressure on the bass which 

00:02:02.290 --> 00:02:06.160
 distinguishes high power amplifiers 

00:02:04.300 --> 00:02:08.229
 but for the rest of the sound range 

00:02:06.160 --> 00:02:11.170
 arkam shows immaculate 

00:02:08.229 --> 00:02:13.030
 sound handwriting dynamics and 19 will have 

00:02:11.170 --> 00:02:15.130
 to taste adherent acoustic 

00:02:13.030 --> 00:02:17.440
 music and not just listen 

00:02:15.130 --> 00:02:20.700
 purchase occam 19 you can in 

00:02:17.440 --> 00:02:20.700
 super stereo store
