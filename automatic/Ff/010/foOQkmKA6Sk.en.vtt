we've<00:02:14.590> built<00:02:14.830> so<00:02:15.130> hopefully<00:02:15.640> if<00:02:15.700> I<00:02:15.760> touch

00:02:15.990 --> 00:02:16.000 
we've built so hopefully if I touch

00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:17.910 
we've built so hopefully if I touch
ground<00:02:16.270> here<00:02:16.600> it<00:02:16.720> should<00:02:16.930> all<00:02:17.050> load<00:02:17.230> in<00:02:17.440> there

00:02:17.910 --> 00:02:17.920 
ground here it should all load in there

00:02:17.920 --> 00:02:22.160 
ground here it should all load in there
we<00:02:18.070> go<00:02:19.440> I'm<00:02:20.440> not<00:02:20.590> too<00:02:20.800> sure<00:02:21.010> why<00:02:21.250> that<00:02:21.280> is<00:02:21.670> but

00:02:22.160 --> 00:02:22.170 
we go I'm not too sure why that is but

00:02:22.170 --> 00:02:24.450 
we go I'm not too sure why that is but
with<00:02:23.170> the<00:02:23.260> new<00:02:23.290> update<00:02:23.410> will<00:02:23.860> be<00:02:23.890> able<00:02:24.040> to<00:02:24.160> sort

00:02:24.450 --> 00:02:24.460 
with the new update will be able to sort

00:02:24.460 --> 00:02:28.170 
with the new update will be able to sort
that<00:02:24.550> out<00:02:24.700> so<00:02:26.160> that<00:02:27.160> just<00:02:27.370> looks<00:02:27.550> awful

00:02:28.170 --> 00:02:28.180 
that out so that just looks awful

00:02:28.180 --> 00:02:32.970 
that out so that just looks awful
doesn't<00:02:28.360> it<00:02:31.080> but<00:02:32.080> yeah<00:02:32.200> this<00:02:32.380> is<00:02:32.440> the<00:02:32.710> Sphinx

I<00:02:43.240> guess<00:02:43.600> that's<00:02:44.380> the<00:02:44.470> spawn<00:02:44.890> building<00:02:45.340> for

00:02:45.570 --> 00:02:45.580 
I guess that's the spawn building for

00:02:45.580 --> 00:02:48.600 
I guess that's the spawn building for
when<00:02:45.760> if<00:02:46.030> and<00:02:46.630> when<00:02:46.750> we<00:02:46.900> did<00:02:47.080> want<00:02:47.230> to<00:02:47.520> open<00:02:48.520> up
