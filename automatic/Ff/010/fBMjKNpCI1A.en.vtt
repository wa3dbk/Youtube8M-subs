00:01:22.109 --> 00:01:22.119 
here and you're gonna have to take them

00:01:22.119 --> 00:01:23.399 
here and you're gonna have to take them
out<00:01:22.210> later<00:01:22.450> anyways<00:01:22.840> but<00:01:23.049> just<00:01:23.200> for<00:01:23.290> now

00:01:23.399 --> 00:01:23.409

it now as you can see here there's a

00:02:45.580 --> 00:02:47.040 
it now as you can see here there's a
little<00:02:45.760> key<00:02:45.940> way<00:02:46.090> there<00:02:46.300> so<00:02:46.330> there's<00:02:46.690> a<00:02:46.750> pin<00:02:47.019> on

00:02:47.040 --> 00:02:47.050 
little key way there so there's a pin on

00:02:47.050 --> 00:02:48.839 
little key way there so there's a pin on
here<00:02:47.410> so<00:02:47.980> make<00:02:48.190> sure<00:02:48.310> you<00:02:48.430> don't<00:02:48.519> drop<00:02:48.790> that

00:02:52.860 --> 00:02:52.870 
out of there and again so installation

00:02:52.870 --> 00:02:56.610 
out of there and again so installation
is<00:02:53.019> just<00:02:53.260> reverse<00:02:53.950> a<00:02:54.160> disassembly<00:02:55.019> and<00:02:56.019> that's

00:02:56.610 --> 00:02:56.620 
is just reverse a disassembly and that's

00:02:56.620 --> 00:02:59.690 
is just reverse a disassembly and that's
it<00:02:56.830> hope<00:02:57.010> that<00:02:57.190> helped<00:02:57.310> you

00:02:59.690 --> 00:02:59.700 

00:02:59.700 --> 00:03:02.069 

okay<00:03:00.700> the<00:03:00.849> stock<00:03:01.060> battery<00:03:01.299> and<00:03:01.630> charger<00:03:01.900> here

00:03:02.069 --> 00:03:02.079 
okay the stock battery and charger here

00:03:02.079 --> 00:03:03.600 
okay the stock battery and charger here
you<00:03:02.230> can<00:03:02.349> see<00:03:02.560> they<00:03:02.980> use<00:03:03.130> this<00:03:03.340> type<00:03:03.579> of

00:03:03.600 --> 00:03:03.610 
you can see they use this type of

00:03:03.610 --> 00:03:05.460 
you can see they use this type of
connector<00:03:03.819> now<00:03:04.450> I<00:03:04.480> mentioned<00:03:04.989> earlier<00:03:05.290> that

00:03:05.460 --> 00:03:05.470 
connector now I mentioned earlier that

00:03:05.470 --> 00:03:07.710 
connector now I mentioned earlier that
I'm<00:03:05.560> going<00:03:05.739> to<00:03:05.769> change<00:03:06.130> the<00:03:06.760> connectors<00:03:07.239> over

00:03:07.710 --> 00:03:07.720 
I'm going to change the connectors over

00:03:07.720 --> 00:03:10.770 
I'm going to change the connectors over
to<00:03:08.470> Dean's<00:03:08.769> connectors<00:03:09.310> now<00:03:10.239> I'm<00:03:10.390> only<00:03:10.569> going

00:03:10.770 --> 00:03:10.780 
to Dean's connectors now I'm only going

00:03:10.780 --> 00:03:12.360 
to Dean's connectors now I'm only going
to<00:03:10.870> change<00:03:11.049> the<00:03:11.349> bat<00:03:11.590> connector<00:03:12.130> on<00:03:12.250> the

00:03:12.360 --> 00:03:12.370 
to change the bat connector on the

00:03:12.370 --> 00:03:14.940 
to change the bat connector on the
battery<00:03:12.780> I'm<00:03:13.780> not<00:03:13.959> changing<00:03:14.260> the<00:03:14.470> connector

00:03:14.940 --> 00:03:14.950 
battery I'm not changing the connector

00:03:14.950 --> 00:03:16.319 
battery I'm not changing the connector
on<00:03:15.040> the<00:03:15.130> charger<00:03:15.400> because<00:03:15.610> I<00:03:15.790> have<00:03:16.030> a<00:03:16.060> better

00:03:16.319 --> 00:03:16.329 
on the charger because I have a better

00:03:16.329 --> 00:03:20.370 
on the charger because I have a better
charger<00:03:16.870> that<00:03:17.530> I<00:03:17.590> use<00:03:18.690> this<00:03:19.690> charger<00:03:20.170> can

00:03:20.370 --> 00:03:20.380 
charger that I use this charger can

00:03:20.380 --> 00:03:23.720 
charger that I use this charger can
charge<00:03:20.650> this<00:03:20.890> battery<00:03:20.950> in<00:03:21.690> about<00:03:22.690> an<00:03:22.840> hour

00:03:23.720 --> 00:03:23.730 
charge this battery in about an hour

00:03:23.730 --> 00:03:29.039 
charge this battery in about an hour
this<00:03:24.730> charger<00:03:25.680> takes<00:03:26.680> about<00:03:26.950> two<00:03:27.430> hours<00:03:28.049> you

00:03:29.039 --> 00:03:29.049 
this charger takes about two hours you

00:03:29.049 --> 00:03:30.720 
this charger takes about two hours you
can<00:03:29.079> actually<00:03:29.530> program<00:03:29.799> this<00:03:30.130> to<00:03:30.310> charge<00:03:30.549> this

00:03:30.720 --> 00:03:30.730 
can actually program this to charge this

00:03:30.730 --> 00:03:32.490 
can actually program this to charge this
quicker<00:03:31.030> but<00:03:31.329> you<00:03:31.750> kind<00:03:32.200> of<00:03:32.290> don't<00:03:32.380> really

00:03:32.490 --> 00:03:32.500 
quicker but you kind of don't really

00:03:32.500 --> 00:03:35.640 
quicker but you kind of don't really
want<00:03:32.769> to<00:03:32.829> do<00:03:32.889> that<00:03:33.090> so<00:03:34.090> anyways<00:03:34.420> this<00:03:35.109> charger

00:03:35.640 --> 00:03:35.650 
want to do that so anyways this charger

00:03:35.650 --> 00:03:37.620 
want to do that so anyways this charger
though<00:03:35.799> it<00:03:35.920> doesn't<00:03:36.100> come<00:03:36.459> with<00:03:36.700> this<00:03:37.359> type<00:03:37.600> of

00:03:37.620 --> 00:03:37.630 
though it doesn't come with this type of

00:03:37.630 --> 00:03:39.690 
though it doesn't come with this type of
connector<00:03:38.109> for<00:03:38.500> it

00:03:39.690 --> 00:03:39.700 
connector for it

00:03:39.700 --> 00:03:42.240 
connector for it
the<00:03:40.120> most<00:03:40.660> basic<00:03:40.840> connector<00:03:41.410> they<00:03:41.530> use<00:03:41.769> our

00:03:42.240 --> 00:03:42.250 
the most basic connector they use our

00:03:42.250 --> 00:03:44.759 
the most basic connector they use our
Dean's<00:03:42.609> connectors<00:03:43.120> and<00:03:43.359> pretty<00:03:43.930> much<00:03:44.079> almost

00:03:44.759 --> 00:03:44.769 
Dean's connectors and pretty much almost

00:03:44.769 --> 00:03:48.210 
Dean's connectors and pretty much almost
almost<00:03:45.130> all<00:03:45.730> lipo's<00:03:46.450> use<00:03:47.230> Dean's<00:03:47.500> connectors

00:03:48.210 --> 00:03:48.220 
almost all lipo's use Dean's connectors

00:03:48.220 --> 00:03:50.729 
almost all lipo's use Dean's connectors
anyways<00:03:48.579> so<00:03:49.150> I'm<00:03:49.569> gonna<00:03:49.780> go<00:03:49.989> ahead<00:03:50.019> change<00:03:50.560> my

anyways so I'm gonna go ahead change my

00:03:50.739 --> 00:03:52.530 
anyways so I'm gonna go ahead change my
battery<00:03:51.069> connector<00:03:51.430> to<00:03:52.120> a<00:03:52.150> Deans<00:03:52.420> connector

00:03:52.530 --> 00:03:52.540 
battery connector to a Deans connector

00:03:52.540 --> 00:03:55.860 
battery connector to a Deans connector
and<00:03:53.139> as<00:03:53.650> I<00:03:53.799> mentioned<00:03:54.190> before<00:03:54.420> once<00:03:55.420> I<00:03:55.569> do<00:03:55.630> the

00:03:55.860 --> 00:03:55.870 
and as I mentioned before once I do the

00:03:55.870 --> 00:03:57.539 
and as I mentioned before once I do the
brushless<00:03:56.109> upgrade<00:03:56.650> I<00:03:56.799> am<00:03:56.920> gonna<00:03:57.069> switch<00:03:57.370> to

00:03:57.539 --> 00:03:57.549 
brushless upgrade I am gonna switch to

00:03:57.549 --> 00:04:00.539 
brushless upgrade I am gonna switch to
using<00:03:57.910> 11.1<00:03:58.870> volt<00:03:59.530> lithium<00:04:00.430> polymer

00:04:00.539 --> 00:04:00.549 
using 11.1 volt lithium polymer

00:04:00.549 --> 00:04:02.520 
using 11.1 volt lithium polymer
batteries<00:04:01.150> and<00:04:01.359> this<00:04:02.049> will<00:04:02.170> give<00:04:02.290> me<00:04:02.380> a<00:04:02.410> little

00:04:02.520 --> 00:04:02.530 
batteries and this will give me a little

00:04:02.530 --> 00:04:04.680 
batteries and this will give me a little
bit<00:04:02.620> more<00:04:02.829> power<00:04:03.220> and<00:04:03.489> stuff<00:04:03.790> like<00:04:03.940> that<00:04:04.239> so

00:04:04.680 --> 00:04:04.690 
bit more power and stuff like that so

00:04:04.690 --> 00:04:07.050 
bit more power and stuff like that so
I'm<00:04:04.780> gonna<00:04:04.900> go<00:04:04.989> ahead<00:04:05.079> and<00:04:05.200> show<00:04:05.440> you<00:04:05.910> what<00:04:06.910> I'm

here<00:04:47.010> again<00:04:48.010> so<00:04:48.250> you<00:04:48.370> can<00:04:48.550> see<00:04:48.700> I've<00:04:49.000> got<00:04:49.120> a

00:04:49.170 --> 00:04:49.180 
here again so you can see I've got a

00:04:49.180 --> 00:04:51.450 
here again so you can see I've got a
Deans<00:04:49.450> connector<00:04:49.740> got<00:04:50.740> some<00:04:50.980> heat<00:04:51.160> shrink

00:04:51.450 --> 00:04:51.460 
Deans connector got some heat shrink

band wrapped around the end and that's

00:04:57.280 --> 00:05:00.210 
band wrapped around the end and that's
makes<00:04:57.610> it<00:04:57.760> easier<00:04:58.090> to<00:04:58.600> hold<00:04:58.780> the<00:04:59.530> wires<00:04:59.800> or<00:05:00.160> the

00:05:00.210 --> 00:05:00.220 
makes it easier to hold the wires or the

00:05:00.220 --> 00:05:02.790 
makes it easier to hold the wires or the
deans<00:05:00.400> connector<00:05:00.850> and<00:05:01.240> I've<00:05:01.630> got<00:05:01.810> some<00:05:02.020> 60/40

00:05:05.850 --> 00:05:05.860 
lead solder and you can see here it is

00:05:05.860 --> 00:05:07.920 
lead solder and you can see here it is
thin<00:05:06.280> don't<00:05:06.850> get<00:05:07.090> a<00:05:07.120> roll<00:05:07.330> that<00:05:07.540> really<00:05:07.780> really

00:05:07.920 --> 00:05:07.930 
thin don't get a roll that really really

00:05:07.930 --> 00:05:10.290 
thin don't get a roll that really really
fix<00:05:08.230> stuff<00:05:08.500> it<00:05:09.250> takes<00:05:09.460> a<00:05:09.580> lot<00:05:09.730> longer<00:05:09.880> to<00:05:10.090> heat

00:05:10.290 --> 00:05:10.300 
fix stuff it takes a lot longer to heat

00:05:10.300 --> 00:05:12.720 
fix stuff it takes a lot longer to heat
up<00:05:10.330> and<00:05:10.780> the<00:05:11.320> last<00:05:11.470> thing<00:05:11.620> is<00:05:12.040> a<00:05:12.070> soldering

soldering here first thing I'm gonna do
you<00:05:22.330> can<00:05:22.360> see<00:05:22.600> that<00:05:22.750> I've<00:05:22.840> got<00:05:22.870> the<00:05:23.140> wire

00:05:23.510 --> 00:05:23.520 
you can see that I've got the wire

00:05:23.520 --> 00:05:25.670 
you can see that I've got the wire
stripped<00:05:24.520> back<00:05:24.700> about<00:05:25.000> a<00:05:25.060> quarter<00:05:25.270> of<00:05:25.450> an<00:05:25.540> inch

00:05:25.670 --> 00:05:25.680 
stripped back about a quarter of an inch

00:05:25.680 --> 00:05:28.050 
stripped back about a quarter of an inch
I'm<00:05:26.680> gonna<00:05:26.860> go<00:05:26.919> ahead<00:05:27.040> and<00:05:27.160> fill<00:05:27.700> the<00:05:27.850> wires

00:05:28.050 --> 00:05:28.060

00:05:28.060 --> 00:05:29.940 
I'm gonna go ahead and fill the wires
with<00:05:28.390> solder<00:05:28.660> and<00:05:28.990> that<00:05:29.470> will<00:05:29.560> get<00:05:29.680> me<00:05:29.800> ready

00:05:29.940 --> 00:05:29.950 
with solder and that will get me ready

00:05:29.950 --> 00:05:34.620 
with solder and that will get me ready
to<00:05:31.169> solder<00:05:32.169> it<00:05:32.290> to<00:05:32.410> that<00:05:32.970> okay<00:05:33.970> so<00:05:34.030> now<00:05:34.300> we<00:05:34.419> do

00:05:34.620 --> 00:05:34.630 
to solder it to that okay so now we do

00:05:34.630 --> 00:05:36.960 
to solder it to that okay so now we do
is<00:05:34.840> I'm<00:05:34.960> going<00:05:35.080> to<00:05:35.169> heat<00:05:35.350> up<00:05:35.380> the<00:05:35.710> very<00:05:35.919> tip<00:05:36.310> of

00:05:36.960 --> 00:05:36.970 
is I'm going to heat up the very tip of

00:05:36.970 --> 00:05:40.200 
is I'm going to heat up the very tip of
the<00:05:37.210> wire<00:05:37.390> and<00:05:38.169> once<00:05:38.860> the<00:05:39.040> wire<00:05:39.190> gets<00:05:39.460> hot<00:05:39.669> I'm

00:05:40.200 --> 00:05:40.210 
the wire and once the wire gets hot I'm

00:05:40.210 --> 00:05:48.700 
the wire and once the wire gets hot I'm
gonna<00:05:40.419> feed<00:05:40.720> the<00:05:40.900> solder<00:05:41.350> in<00:05:41.680> the<00:05:42.340> back<00:05:42.520> of<00:05:42.729> it

00:05:48.700 --> 00:05:48.710 

00:05:48.710 --> 00:05:51.790 

and<00:05:49.710> I'm<00:05:49.950> just<00:05:50.100> gonna<00:05:50.220> let<00:05:50.520> it<00:05:50.640> fill<00:05:50.820> in<00:05:50.970> there

00:05:51.790 --> 00:05:51.800 
and I'm just gonna let it fill in there

00:05:51.800 --> 00:05:54.320 
and I'm just gonna let it fill in there
till<00:05:52.800> it<00:05:52.890> fills<00:05:53.130> the<00:05:53.250> wire<00:05:53.490> up<00:05:53.730> nice<00:05:53.940> and<00:05:53.970> full

00:05:54.320 --> 00:05:54.330 
till it fills the wire up nice and full

00:05:54.330 --> 00:05:55.910 
till it fills the wire up nice and full
of<00:05:54.390> solder<00:05:54.720> in<00:05:54.870> there<00:05:55.020> then<00:05:55.590> I'm<00:05:55.650> gonna<00:05:55.740> do<00:05:55.890> the

00:05:55.910 --> 00:05:55.920 
of solder in there then I'm gonna do the

00:05:55.920 --> 00:05:58.400 
of solder in there then I'm gonna do the
same<00:05:56.010> thing<00:05:56.250> to<00:05:56.730> the<00:05:56.850> other<00:05:57.030> wire<00:05:57.330> okay<00:05:58.110> next

00:05:58.400 --> 00:05:58.410 
same thing to the other wire okay next

00:05:58.410 --> 00:06:00.560 
same thing to the other wire okay next
step<00:05:58.740> is<00:05:59.010> getting<00:05:59.670> the<00:05:59.880> actual<00:06:00.120> Dean's

00:06:00.560 --> 00:06:00.570 
step is getting the actual Dean's

00:06:00.570 --> 00:06:03.710 
step is getting the actual Dean's
terminal<00:06:01.050> ready<00:06:01.650> for<00:06:01.920> solder<00:06:02.540> it's<00:06:03.540> what

00:06:03.710 --> 00:06:03.720 
terminal ready for solder it's what

00:06:03.720 --> 00:06:06.140 
terminal ready for solder it's what
we're<00:06:03.870> gonna<00:06:03.960> do<00:06:04.260> is<00:06:04.500> I'm<00:06:04.890> gonna<00:06:04.980> put<00:06:05.370> a<00:06:05.610> nice

00:06:06.140 --> 00:06:06.150 
we're gonna do is I'm gonna put a nice

00:06:06.150 --> 00:06:08.750 
we're gonna do is I'm gonna put a nice
little<00:06:06.450> bead<00:06:06.750> of<00:06:06.810> solder<00:06:07.170> right<00:06:08.070> on<00:06:08.220> here<00:06:08.580> and

00:06:08.750 --> 00:06:08.760 
little bead of solder right on here and

00:06:08.760 --> 00:06:14.540 
little bead of solder right on here and
you<00:06:08.850> can<00:06:08.910> see<00:06:12.230> nothing<00:06:13.230> on<00:06:13.380> there<00:06:13.650> what<00:06:14.370> do<00:06:14.430> I

00:06:14.540 --> 00:06:14.550 
you can see nothing on there what do I

00:06:14.550 --> 00:06:15.740 
you can see nothing on there what do I
do<00:06:14.610> is<00:06:14.850> I<00:06:14.910> just<00:06:15.060> want<00:06:15.210> to<00:06:15.270> put<00:06:15.420> a<00:06:15.450> nice<00:06:15.570> little

00:06:15.740 --> 00:06:15.750 
do is I just want to put a nice little

00:06:15.750 --> 00:06:17.930 
do is I just want to put a nice little
bead<00:06:16.080> on<00:06:16.350> there<00:06:16.590> so<00:06:17.280> that<00:06:17.430> I<00:06:17.490> have<00:06:17.670> something

00:06:17.930 --> 00:06:17.940 
bead on there so that I have something

00:06:17.940 --> 00:06:20.870 
bead on there so that I have something
to<00:06:18.180> solder<00:06:18.390> the<00:06:18.570> wire<00:06:18.750> to<00:06:19.460> so<00:06:20.460> I'm<00:06:20.520> gonna<00:06:20.610> do<00:06:20.730> is

00:06:20.870 --> 00:06:20.880 
to solder the wire to so I'm gonna do is

00:06:20.880 --> 00:06:26.180 
to solder the wire to so I'm gonna do is
just<00:06:20.910> go<00:06:21.620> heat<00:06:22.620> up<00:06:22.650> the<00:06:22.920> tip<00:06:23.130> of<00:06:23.310> it<00:06:24.260> and<00:06:25.260> then

00:06:26.180 --> 00:06:26.190 
just go heat up the tip of it and then

00:06:26.190 --> 00:06:29.300 
just go heat up the tip of it and then
I'm<00:06:26.280> just<00:06:26.310> gonna<00:06:27.650> put<00:06:28.650> a<00:06:28.680> little<00:06:28.800> bit<00:06:28.890> aside<00:06:28.980> on

00:06:29.300 --> 00:06:29.310 
I'm just gonna put a little bit aside on

00:06:29.310 --> 00:06:32.720 
I'm just gonna put a little bit aside on
there<00:06:30.230> and<00:06:31.230> just<00:06:31.710> let<00:06:31.890> it<00:06:31.920> form<00:06:32.310> a<00:06:32.370> little<00:06:32.580> bead

00:06:32.720 --> 00:06:32.730 
there and just let it form a little bead

00:06:32.730 --> 00:06:35.150 
there and just let it form a little bead
there<00:06:33.000> and<00:06:33.090> let<00:06:33.180> it<00:06:33.300> cool<00:06:33.680> so<00:06:34.680> now<00:06:34.800> I'm<00:06:35.010> going

00:06:35.150 --> 00:06:35.160 
there and let it cool so now I'm going

00:06:35.160 --> 00:06:37.790 
there and let it cool so now I'm going
to<00:06:35.220> do<00:06:35.400> is<00:06:35.780> again<00:06:36.780> on<00:06:37.140> the<00:06:37.230> backside<00:06:37.650> of<00:06:37.680> the

00:06:37.790 --> 00:06:37.800 
to do is again on the backside of the

00:06:37.800 --> 00:06:39.620 
to do is again on the backside of the
terminal<00:06:38.190> that<00:06:38.220> tells<00:06:38.490> you<00:06:38.700> which<00:06:39.240> side<00:06:39.450> is

00:06:39.620 --> 00:06:39.630 
terminal that tells you which side is

00:06:39.630 --> 00:06:41.570 
terminal that tells you which side is
positive<00:06:40.110> which<00:06:40.290> is<00:06:40.440> negative<00:06:40.860> so<00:06:41.340> now<00:06:41.460> I'm

00:06:41.570 --> 00:06:41.580 
positive which is negative so now I'm

00:06:41.580 --> 00:06:45.050 
positive which is negative so now I'm
going<00:06:41.700> to<00:06:41.760> do<00:06:41.880> is<00:06:42.380> take<00:06:43.380> the<00:06:43.620> wire<00:06:43.830> I'll<00:06:44.790> place

00:06:45.050 --> 00:06:45.060 
going to do is take the wire I'll place

00:06:45.060 --> 00:06:47.330 
going to do is take the wire I'll place
it<00:06:45.240> on<00:06:45.360> top<00:06:45.600> and<00:06:45.960> then<00:06:46.170> I'm<00:06:46.950> gonna<00:06:47.040> put<00:06:47.220> the

00:06:47.330 --> 00:06:47.340 
it on top and then I'm gonna put the

00:06:47.340 --> 00:06:49.370 
it on top and then I'm gonna put the
heat<00:06:47.520> the<00:06:47.820> soldering<00:06:48.420> iron<00:06:48.570> right<00:06:48.720> on<00:06:48.840> top<00:06:49.050> and

00:06:49.370 --> 00:06:49.380 
heat the soldering iron right on top and

00:06:49.380 --> 00:06:51.740 
heat the soldering iron right on top and
it'll<00:06:50.070> melt<00:06:50.280> the<00:06:50.460> solder<00:06:50.670> on<00:06:51.000> the<00:06:51.090> wire<00:06:51.450> and

00:06:51.740 --> 00:06:51.750 
it'll melt the solder on the wire and

00:06:51.750 --> 00:06:53.150 
it'll melt the solder on the wire and
then<00:06:52.170> it<00:06:52.290> will<00:06:52.380> melt<00:06:52.530> the<00:06:52.620> solder<00:06:52.830> around<00:06:53.010> the

00:06:53.150 --> 00:06:53.160 
then it will melt the solder around the

00:06:53.160 --> 00:06:54.680 
then it will melt the solder around the
terminal<00:06:53.580> and<00:06:54.090> when<00:06:54.240> melts<00:06:54.480> the<00:06:54.540> solder

00:06:54.680 --> 00:06:54.690 
terminal and when melts the solder

00:06:54.690 --> 00:06:56.720 
terminal and when melts the solder
around<00:06:54.930> the<00:06:54.990> terminal<00:06:55.410> take<00:06:56.130> the<00:06:56.280> soldering

00:06:56.720 --> 00:06:56.730 
around the terminal take the soldering

00:06:56.730 --> 00:06:59.240 
around the terminal take the soldering
iron<00:06:56.910> off<00:06:57.210> hold<00:06:58.020> it<00:06:58.200> till<00:06:58.410> it's<00:06:58.590> cool<00:06:58.860> don't

00:06:59.240 --> 00:06:59.250 
iron off hold it till it's cool don't

00:06:59.250 --> 00:07:00.590 
iron off hold it till it's cool don't
move<00:06:59.550> it<00:06:59.760> until<00:06:59.820> it's<00:07:00.150> cool

00:07:00.590 --> 00:07:00.600 
move it until it's cool

00:07:00.600 --> 00:07:03.470 
move it until it's cool
otherwise<00:07:01.290> you'll<00:07:01.530> mess<00:07:01.950> it<00:07:02.130> up<00:07:02.330> after<00:07:03.330> it's

00:07:03.470 --> 00:07:03.480 
otherwise you'll mess it up after it's

00:07:03.480 --> 00:07:06.800 
otherwise you'll mess it up after it's
cool<00:07:03.920> it's<00:07:04.920> all<00:07:05.040> good<00:07:05.280> to<00:07:05.370> go<00:07:05.570> so<00:07:06.570> now<00:07:06.750> you

00:07:06.800 --> 00:07:06.810 
cool it's all good to go so now you

00:07:06.810 --> 00:07:11.690 
cool it's all good to go so now you
would<00:07:07.460> slide<00:07:08.460> the<00:07:08.990> heat<00:07:09.990> shrink<00:07:10.020> over<00:07:10.440> it<00:07:10.700> heat

00:07:11.690 --> 00:07:11.700 
would slide the heat shrink over it heat

00:07:11.700 --> 00:07:14.300 
would slide the heat shrink over it heat
shrink<00:07:12.000> it<00:07:12.180> and<00:07:12.600> then<00:07:13.260> do<00:07:13.530> the<00:07:13.680> same<00:07:13.860> thing<00:07:13.920> for

00:07:14.300 --> 00:07:14.310 
shrink it and then do the same thing for

00:07:14.310 --> 00:07:16.730 
shrink it and then do the same thing for
the<00:07:14.400> other<00:07:14.430> side<00:07:14.790> there<00:07:15.140> now<00:07:16.140> if<00:07:16.410> you<00:07:16.620> were

00:07:16.730 --> 00:07:16.740 
the other side there now if you were

00:07:16.740 --> 00:07:19.430 
the other side there now if you were
soldering<00:07:17.250> this<00:07:17.520> say<00:07:18.450> a<00:07:18.480> new<00:07:18.780> connector<00:07:19.260> on<00:07:19.410> a

00:07:19.430 --> 00:07:19.440 
soldering this say a new connector on a

00:07:19.440 --> 00:07:21.230 
soldering this say a new connector on a
battery<00:07:19.920> what<00:07:20.190> you<00:07:20.310> would<00:07:20.460> do<00:07:20.610> you<00:07:21.210> would

00:07:21.230 --> 00:07:21.240 
battery what you would do you would

00:07:21.240 --> 00:07:24.650 
battery what you would do you would
actually<00:07:21.480> cut<00:07:22.110> the<00:07:22.290> what<00:07:22.470> one<00:07:22.890> wire<00:07:23.160> off<00:07:23.660> you

00:07:24.650 --> 00:07:24.660 
actually cut the what one wire off you

00:07:24.660 --> 00:07:26.660 
actually cut the what one wire off you
would<00:07:24.780> fill<00:07:25.020> a<00:07:25.050> full<00:07:25.320> solder<00:07:25.650> and<00:07:25.980> then<00:07:26.340> solder

00:07:26.660 --> 00:07:26.670 
would fill a full solder and then solder

00:07:26.670 --> 00:07:30.950 
would fill a full solder and then solder
it<00:07:26.940> to<00:07:27.300> the<00:07:27.450> deans<00:07:27.690> terminal<00:07:28.290> and<00:07:29.150> then<00:07:30.150> you

00:07:30.950 --> 00:07:30.960 
it to the deans terminal and then you

00:07:30.960 --> 00:07:32.480 
it to the deans terminal and then you
and<00:07:31.140> heat<00:07:31.380> strength<00:07:31.650> of<00:07:31.800> tubing<00:07:32.040> after<00:07:32.370> you

00:07:32.480 --> 00:07:32.490 
and heat strength of tubing after you

00:07:32.490 --> 00:07:35.000 
and heat strength of tubing after you
sign<00:07:32.700> around<00:07:33.000> there<00:07:33.180> then<00:07:34.170> go<00:07:34.470> ahead<00:07:34.560> and<00:07:34.830> cut

00:07:35.000 --> 00:07:35.010 
sign around there then go ahead and cut

00:07:35.010 --> 00:07:37.370 
sign around there then go ahead and cut
the<00:07:35.160> other<00:07:35.340> wire<00:07:35.610> and<00:07:36.030> go<00:07:36.840> ahead<00:07:36.990> and<00:07:37.170> do<00:07:37.230> it

00:07:37.370 --> 00:07:37.380 
the other wire and go ahead and do it

00:07:37.380 --> 00:07:39.800 
the other wire and go ahead and do it
you<00:07:37.710> know<00:07:37.830> finish<00:07:38.400> soldering<00:07:38.730> it<00:07:38.880> you'd<00:07:39.270> only

00:07:39.800 --> 00:07:39.810 
you know finish soldering it you'd only

00:07:39.810 --> 00:07:41.510 
you know finish soldering it you'd only
do<00:07:40.080> one<00:07:40.350> wire<00:07:40.530> in<00:07:40.710> time<00:07:40.890> when<00:07:41.070> you're<00:07:41.190> doing<00:07:41.460> a

00:07:41.510 --> 00:07:41.520 
do one wire in time when you're doing a

00:07:41.520 --> 00:07:43.340
