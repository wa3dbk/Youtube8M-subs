00:01:42.080 --> 00:01:42.090 
point I've been playing it for so long

00:01:42.090 --> 00:01:44.719 
point I've been playing it for so long
that<00:01:42.450> I<00:01:43.229> mean<00:01:43.439> the<00:01:43.500> maps<00:01:43.710> have<00:01:43.950> become<00:01:44.220> stale

00:01:44.719 --> 00:01:44.729 
that I mean the maps have become stale

00:01:44.729 --> 00:01:46.580 
that I mean the maps have become stale
it's<00:01:45.240> pretty<00:01:45.840> much<00:01:45.960> like<00:01:46.020> doing<00:01:46.380> the<00:01:46.439> same

00:01:46.580 --> 00:01:46.590 
it's pretty much like doing the same

00:01:46.590 --> 00:01:49.639 
it's pretty much like doing the same
thing<00:01:46.860> over<00:01:46.979> and<00:01:47.130> over<00:01:47.280> again<00:01:47.610> and<00:01:48.409> it<00:01:49.409> I<00:01:49.590> think

00:01:49.639 --> 00:01:49.649 
thing over and over again and it I think

00:01:49.649 --> 00:01:55.569 
thing over and over again and it I think
it's<00:01:49.950> time<00:01:50.159> to<00:01:50.460> sort<00:01:50.729> of<00:01:51.259> give<00:01:52.259> it<00:01:52.290> a<00:01:52.439> rest<00:01:54.500> and

00:01:55.569 --> 00:01:55.579 
it's time to sort of give it a rest and

00:01:55.579 --> 00:01:58.359 
it's time to sort of give it a rest and
again<00:01:56.579> I<00:01:56.670> know<00:01:56.729> that<00:01:57.240> many<00:01:57.360> of<00:01:57.479> you<00:01:57.540> guys<00:01:57.750> are
