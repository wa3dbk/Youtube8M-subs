00:05:07.689 --> 00:05:07.699 
was harder to get the glitter out and I

00:05:07.699 --> 00:05:09.760 
was harder to get the glitter out and I
had<00:05:07.879> to<00:05:08.000> do<00:05:08.120> a<00:05:08.150> couple<00:05:08.360> passes<00:05:08.719> to<00:05:09.229> get<00:05:09.379> it<00:05:09.560> but

00:05:09.760 --> 00:05:09.770 
had to do a couple passes to get it but

00:05:09.770 --> 00:05:11.469 
had to do a couple passes to get it but
overall<00:05:10.099> I<00:05:10.219> mean<00:05:10.370> they<00:05:10.669> did<00:05:10.819> work<00:05:11.060> and<00:05:11.240> it<00:05:11.330> did

00:05:11.469 --> 00:05:11.479 
overall I mean they did work and it did

00:05:11.479 --> 00:05:13.749 
overall I mean they did work and it did
come<00:05:11.659> out<00:05:11.719> the<00:05:11.990> tip<00:05:12.259> I<00:05:12.530> will<00:05:12.979> note<00:05:13.400> that<00:05:13.430> they

come out the tip I will note that they
are<00:05:13.789> better<00:05:14.389> quality<00:05:14.960> than<00:05:15.909> this<00:05:16.909> kind<00:05:17.210> I

00:05:17.559 --> 00:05:17.569

for<00:05:20.870> close<00:05:21.650> to<00:05:21.860> nothing<00:05:22.069> I<00:05:22.909> believe<00:05:23.900> I<00:05:23.960> got

00:05:24.070 --> 00:05:24.080 
for close to nothing I believe I got

00:05:24.080 --> 00:05:25.749 
for close to nothing I believe I got
like<00:05:24.229> twenty<00:05:24.590> four<00:05:24.919> and<00:05:25.099> I<00:05:25.190> think<00:05:25.370> it<00:05:25.460> was<00:05:25.580> for

00:05:25.749 --> 00:05:25.759 
like twenty four and I think it was for

00:05:25.759 --> 00:05:27.249 
like twenty four and I think it was for
like<00:05:25.879> seven<00:05:26.270> dollars<00:05:26.419> or<00:05:26.810> something<00:05:27.139> like

00:05:27.249 --> 00:05:27.259 
like seven dollars or something like

00:05:27.259 --> 00:05:29.110 
like seven dollars or something like
that<00:05:27.319> it<00:05:27.590> was<00:05:27.650> really<00:05:27.710> inexpensive<00:05:28.190> and<00:05:28.940> these

00:05:29.110 --> 00:05:29.120 
that it was really inexpensive and these

00:05:29.120 --> 00:05:31.420 
that it was really inexpensive and these
ones<00:05:29.360> they<00:05:29.990> do<00:05:30.050> kind<00:05:30.680> of<00:05:30.830> work<00:05:31.039> but<00:05:31.280> they're

00:05:31.420 --> 00:05:31.430 
ones they do kind of work but they're

00:05:31.430 --> 00:05:33.790 
ones they do kind of work but they're
not<00:05:31.550> very<00:05:31.879> pigmented<00:05:32.530> also<00:05:33.530> the<00:05:33.680> other

00:05:33.790 --> 00:05:33.800 
not very pigmented also the other

00:05:33.800 --> 00:05:35.619 
not very pigmented also the other
problem<00:05:34.219> that<00:05:34.250> I<00:05:34.400> had<00:05:34.729> with<00:05:34.940> them<00:05:35.120> was<00:05:35.180> that

00:05:35.619 --> 00:05:35.629 
problem that I had with them was that

00:05:35.629 --> 00:05:37.689 
problem that I had with them was that
the<00:05:35.900> actual<00:05:36.409> needle<00:05:36.710> kept<00:05:37.069> getting<00:05:37.430> plugged

00:05:37.689 --> 00:05:37.699 
the actual needle kept getting plugged

00:05:37.699 --> 00:05:40.209 
the actual needle kept getting plugged
up<00:05:37.969> and<00:05:38.210> I<00:05:38.330> couldn't<00:05:38.630> use<00:05:38.750> them<00:05:38.960> very<00:05:38.990> well<00:05:39.380> so

00:05:40.209 --> 00:05:40.219 
up and I couldn't use them very well so

00:05:40.219 --> 00:05:42.670 
up and I couldn't use them very well so
I<00:05:40.250> was<00:05:40.550> never<00:05:40.699> a<00:05:40.849> big<00:05:40.969> fan<00:05:41.479> of<00:05:41.509> these<00:05:41.840> I<00:05:41.870> do<00:05:42.289> feel

00:05:42.670 --> 00:05:42.680 
I was never a big fan of these I do feel

00:05:42.680 --> 00:05:44.950 
I was never a big fan of these I do feel
like<00:05:42.710> the<00:05:43.250> pin<00:05:43.520> ones<00:05:43.759> here<00:05:44.120> are<00:05:44.300> better

00:05:44.950 --> 00:05:44.960 
like the pin ones here are better

00:05:44.960 --> 00:05:47.140 
like the pin ones here are better
quality<00:05:45.529> at<00:05:45.740> least<00:05:45.919> for<00:05:46.130> what's<00:05:46.340> inside<00:05:46.849> them

00:05:47.140 --> 00:05:47.150 
quality at least for what's inside them

00:05:47.150 --> 00:05:51.279 
quality at least for what's inside them
they<00:05:48.110> do<00:05:48.169> have<00:05:48.500> a<00:05:48.529> strong<00:05:49.330> nail<00:05:50.330> polish<00:05:50.840> smell

00:05:51.279 --> 00:05:51.289 
they do have a strong nail polish smell

00:05:51.289 --> 00:05:53.200 
they do have a strong nail polish smell
but<00:05:51.500> it's<00:05:51.680> not<00:05:51.830> a<00:05:51.860> weird<00:05:52.190> now<00:05:52.460> polished<00:05:52.880> smell

00:05:53.200 --> 00:05:53.210 
but it's not a weird now polished smell

00:05:53.210 --> 00:05:55.240 
but it's not a weird now polished smell
if<00:05:53.360> that<00:05:53.509> makes<00:05:53.690> sense<00:05:53.840> they<00:05:54.800> do<00:05:54.860> smell<00:05:55.099> like

00:05:55.240 --> 00:05:55.250 
if that makes sense they do smell like

00:05:55.250 --> 00:05:57.370 
if that makes sense they do smell like
nail<00:05:55.460> polish<00:05:55.880> it's<00:05:56.270> a<00:05:56.419> little<00:05:56.659> bit<00:05:56.779> strong<00:05:57.080> but

00:05:57.380 --> 00:05:59.740 
nail polish it's a little bit strong but
it's<00:05:57.529> not<00:05:57.680> overpowering<00:05:58.159> or<00:05:59.060> tore<00:05:59.449> it's<00:05:59.599> gonna

00:05:59.740 --> 00:05:59.750

swatches<00:06:04.969> and<00:06:05.599> they<00:06:06.349> all<00:06:06.469> worked<00:06:06.680> fine<00:06:06.979> with

00:06:07.149 --> 00:06:07.159 
swatches and they all worked fine with

00:06:07.159 --> 00:06:09.399 
swatches and they all worked fine with
the<00:06:07.279> pen<00:06:07.520> I<00:06:08.090> didn't<00:06:08.870> have<00:06:08.990> any<00:06:09.139> that<00:06:09.289> were

00:06:09.399 --> 00:06:09.409

the pen I didn't have any that were
plugged<00:06:09.710> up<00:06:09.919> or<00:06:10.129> anything<00:06:10.340> if<00:06:11.120> I<00:06:11.659> didn't<00:06:12.050> shake

00:06:12.369 --> 00:06:12.379

00:06:12.379 --> 00:06:14.140 
plugged up or anything if I didn't shake
them<00:06:12.560> they<00:06:12.590> were<00:06:12.800> a<00:06:12.979> little<00:06:13.310> bit<00:06:13.460> watery<00:06:13.849> so

00:06:14.140 --> 00:06:14.150 
them they were a little bit watery so

00:06:14.150 --> 00:06:15.670 
them they were a little bit watery so
like<00:06:14.270> you<00:06:14.389> can<00:06:14.569> see<00:06:14.750> here<00:06:14.990> on<00:06:15.139> the<00:06:15.259> green<00:06:15.500> one

like you can see here on the green one

00:06:15.680 --> 00:06:17.589 
like you can see here on the green one
at<00:06:15.860> the<00:06:15.979> top<00:06:16.190> it's<00:06:16.370> a<00:06:16.460> little<00:06:16.729> lighter<00:06:16.969> so<00:06:17.449> what

00:06:17.589 --> 00:06:17.599 
at the top it's a little lighter so what

00:06:17.599 --> 00:06:19.269 
at the top it's a little lighter so what
that<00:06:17.750> is<00:06:17.900> I<00:06:18.199> didn't<00:06:18.500> shake<00:06:18.740> it<00:06:18.889> before<00:06:19.250> I

00:06:19.269 --> 00:06:19.279 
that is I didn't shake it before I

00:06:19.279 --> 00:06:20.800 
that is I didn't shake it before I
actually<00:06:19.580> put<00:06:20.000> it<00:06:20.090> on<00:06:20.210> the<00:06:20.389> paper

00:06:20.800 --> 00:06:20.810 
actually put it on the paper

00:06:20.810 --> 00:06:22.809 
actually put it on the paper
I<00:06:20.990> so<00:06:21.680> it<00:06:21.740> came<00:06:21.830> out<00:06:22.009> a<00:06:22.039> little<00:06:22.159> bit<00:06:22.400> watery<00:06:22.669> at

00:06:22.809 --> 00:06:22.819 
I so it came out a little bit watery at

00:06:22.819 --> 00:06:24.490 
I so it came out a little bit watery at
first<00:06:23.240> but<00:06:23.539> right<00:06:23.719> on<00:06:23.750> the<00:06:23.960> packaging<00:06:24.379> it

00:06:24.490 --> 00:06:24.500 
first but right on the packaging it

00:06:24.500 --> 00:06:26.619 
first but right on the packaging it
tells<00:06:24.710> you<00:06:24.889> to<00:06:25.190> shake<00:06:25.610> it<00:06:25.789> so<00:06:26.029> that<00:06:26.240> was<00:06:26.360> my<00:06:26.509> own

00:06:26.619 --> 00:06:26.629
