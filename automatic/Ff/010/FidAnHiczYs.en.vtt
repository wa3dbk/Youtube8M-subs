00:00:19.539 --> 00:00:24.170
 daisy of mézerac the gardens of the 

00:00:22.100 --> 00:00:26.360
 cannon castle here what is 

00:00:24.170 --> 00:00:30.890
 admirable it is especially having 

00:00:26.360 --> 00:00:32.329
 preserved impact all a route from a 

00:00:30.890 --> 00:00:33.530
 quite short period ie the 

00:00:32.329 --> 00:00:36.620
 second half of the eighteenth century 

00:00:33.530 --> 00:00:37.720
 the origin of the site is surely at the 

00:00:36.620 --> 00:00:40.190
 profundity of waters 

00:00:37.720 --> 00:00:41.750
 we already have the water mirror so the 

00:00:40.190 --> 00:00:43.220
 particularity of a mirror is that these 

00:00:41.750 --> 00:00:45.350
 water tables it is important not to 

00:00:43.220 --> 00:00:46.879
 fountain so that they can offer to 

00:00:45.350 --> 00:00:50.269
 reflections and here in this case it is the 

00:00:46.879 --> 00:00:51.950
 reflection of the castle we also have the 

00:00:50.269 --> 00:00:54.170
 ons that is derived in a multitude of 

00:00:51.950 --> 00:00:55.969
 small channels and that gives rise 

00:00:54.170 --> 00:00:57.920
 also to waterfalls 

00:00:55.969 --> 00:00:59.930
 the goal was to hear the sound of 

00:00:57.920 --> 00:01:02.210
 nature and that one is attracted even 

00:00:59.930 --> 00:01:05.300
 from here one would hear almost lessons from the 

00:01:02.210 --> 00:01:07.670
 waterfall a little further and finally we have 

00:01:05.300 --> 00:01:09.649
 the grand canal that is fed from a 

00:01:07.670 --> 00:01:12.350
 side by the sources of each other by this 

00:01:09.649 --> 00:01:15.220
 small canal that is an arm of the laizon and 

00:01:12.350 --> 00:01:18.160
 which was created for 

00:01:15.220 --> 00:01:20.620
 to make an effect of perspective and especially 

00:01:18.160 --> 00:01:23.740
 not fencing the estate by a wall but 

00:01:20.620 --> 00:01:25.990
 on the contrary have a breakthrough that offers 

00:01:23.740 --> 00:01:30.160
 the ability to look to get lost 

00:01:25.990 --> 00:01:32.170
 far then the park at the corner s of cannon 

00:01:30.160 --> 00:01:34.390
 it's already a trail with trails 

00:01:32.170 --> 00:01:35.920
 winding a lot of water and waterfalls 

00:01:34.390 --> 00:01:39.130
 to hear the noise of nature 

00:01:35.920 --> 00:01:41.980
 and then plantations especially not well 

00:01:39.130 --> 00:01:43.920
 aligned but which was meant to have 

00:01:41.980 --> 00:01:46.660
 the most natural air possible 

00:01:43.920 --> 00:01:49.180
 there was so much creative work 

00:01:46.660 --> 00:01:51.160
 than in a French garden where there 

00:01:49.180 --> 00:01:53.560
 obviously the hand of man and videos 

00:01:51.160 --> 00:01:55.420
 the garden to English zh needed 

00:01:53.560 --> 00:01:56.979
 so much work to shape the 

00:01:55.420 --> 00:01:58.930
 household land and troughs and 

00:01:56.979 --> 00:02:01.780
 bumps deflect the streams but the 

00:01:58.930 --> 00:02:04.119
 purpose is that by walking one gets 

00:02:01.780 --> 00:02:06.960
 found as in a nature a small 

00:02:04.119 --> 00:02:06.960
 little idealized as 

00:02:12.650 --> 00:02:17.659
 sail then here we are at the 

00:02:15.110 --> 00:02:20.090
 cannon cascade see that enough 

00:02:17.659 --> 00:02:23.450
 noisy and 

00:02:20.090 --> 00:02:26.800
 seen it's actually by that are 2 of 

00:02:23.450 --> 00:02:29.000
 lost and noises of the nature of dépayser 

00:02:26.800 --> 00:02:31.160
 you see me a cannon of water there is 

00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:33.190
 really everywhere and 

00:02:31.160 --> 00:02:35.110
 the park also 

00:02:33.190 --> 00:02:36.250
 many other surprises that are 

00:02:35.110 --> 00:02:38.290
 original factories 

00:02:36.250 --> 00:02:39.610
 we had the chance to keep so if 

00:02:38.290 --> 00:02:41.940
 you want but you show it 

00:02:39.610 --> 00:02:41.940
 some 

00:02:49.140 --> 00:02:56.860
 So here we are in the big 

00:02:52.210 --> 00:03:01.270
 east-west axis that structures the design of the 

00:02:56.860 --> 00:03:04.150
 park and to my right g the Chinese helmet 

00:03:01.270 --> 00:03:04.600
 to my left at the very bottom the temple of the 

00:03:04.150 --> 00:03:07.660
 mourner 

00:03:04.600 --> 00:03:10.270
 and there I am in front of the dovecote so 

00:03:07.660 --> 00:03:13.720
 these are three of the factories we have 

00:03:10.270 --> 00:03:15.250
 keep on gun so here I go 

00:03:13.720 --> 00:03:17.260
 still take you to the helmet because 

00:03:15.250 --> 00:03:19.360
 that you are going to see it's one of the very 

00:03:17.260 --> 00:03:28.690
 beautiful views we have in the park 

00:03:19.360 --> 00:03:30.790
 of kano so here we are here in 

00:03:28.690 --> 00:03:33.640
 the Chinese helmet this is one of the places 

00:03:30.790 --> 00:03:35.890
 the most romantic park and see it 

00:03:33.640 --> 00:03:37.630
 always hear the taste of water as 

00:03:35.890 --> 00:03:39.910
 a little bit everywhere in this park in 

00:03:37.630 --> 00:03:41.530
 English you then you had to 

00:03:39.910 --> 00:03:42.970
 note that we do not hear that 

00:03:41.530 --> 00:03:45.340
 sound of water we also hear the 

00:03:42.970 --> 00:03:46.290
 animals because we now have on the 

00:03:45.340 --> 00:03:49.079
 field 

00:03:46.290 --> 00:03:51.239
 an educational farm so the park 

00:03:49.079 --> 00:03:55.049
 continues to live to develop 

00:03:51.239 --> 00:03:56.849
 always in the spirit of the 18th so a 

00:03:55.049 --> 00:03:58.950
 we have factories but we have 

00:03:56.849 --> 00:04:00.689
 also enclosed gardens that 

00:03:58.950 --> 00:04:12.870
 called the chartreuse and in which 

00:04:00.689 --> 00:04:15.629
 I will now take you 

00:04:12.870 --> 00:04:18.239
 here we are in the chartreuses these 

00:04:15.629 --> 00:04:20.660
 gardens that besides being designed 

00:04:18.239 --> 00:04:22.710
 to be beautiful had a use 

00:04:20.660 --> 00:04:24.419
 particular in the eighteenth century 

00:04:22.710 --> 00:04:26.430
 in the same way as the water mirror 

00:04:24.419 --> 00:04:28.110
 was also used to live these gardens 

00:04:26.430 --> 00:04:29.729
 were also utility gardens 

00:04:28.110 --> 00:04:30.210
 since trees were grown there 

00:04:29.729 --> 00:04:32.490
 fruit 

00:04:30.210 --> 00:04:34.169
 so this is the wall was not smooth 

00:04:32.490 --> 00:04:36.690
 apple trees and pear trees but 

00:04:34.169 --> 00:04:39.780
 also the stone trees and the 

00:04:36.690 --> 00:04:42.380
 protect from winds and during the 20th 

00:04:39.780 --> 00:04:47.759
 century it is our aunt who besides 

00:04:42.380 --> 00:04:50.070
 happens who participated in replanting all 

00:04:47.759 --> 00:04:55.830
 these gardens of very composition 

00:04:50.070 --> 00:04:58.060
 spectacular of perennial here 

00:04:55.830 --> 00:05:02.990
 Daisy 

00:04:58.060 --> 00:05:07.520
 wang quan is how are you going 

00:05:02.990 --> 00:05:12.830
 came to admire your flowers to many people 

00:05:07.520 --> 00:05:13.910
 who will come flat with you go 

00:05:12.830 --> 00:05:15.380
 serve as a guide 

00:05:13.910 --> 00:05:18.940
 I leave you in the company of 

00:05:15.380 --> 00:05:21.110
 christophe and not extend the being 

00:05:18.940 --> 00:05:23.420
 let's say it was my start a little 

00:05:21.110 --> 00:05:24.680
 little here anyway with Madame de 

00:05:23.420 --> 00:05:27.050
 Carpentier who still gave me 

00:05:24.680 --> 00:05:28.310
 learned a little about chartreuses then 

00:05:27.050 --> 00:05:31.240
 it's true that it's still really 

00:05:28.310 --> 00:05:33.380
 a bit my field pace cdcc dessert to 

00:05:31.240 --> 00:05:36.530
 open sky if you want is when 

00:05:33.380 --> 00:05:39.410
 it's a very unique thing 

00:05:36.530 --> 00:05:41.180
 see we just have the highest walls 

00:05:39.410 --> 00:05:42.500
 is north to protect well and 

00:05:41.180 --> 00:05:45.050
 and then that we also allow 

00:05:42.500 --> 00:05:46.580
 to concentrate all the heat and 

00:05:45.050 --> 00:05:48.550
 grow the plants all the same 

00:05:46.580 --> 00:05:50.930
 originally fruit trees 

00:05:48.550 --> 00:05:52.940
 it's after that was a little 

00:05:50.930 --> 00:05:55.700
 abandoned and then it was redeveloped 

00:05:52.940 --> 00:05:56.780
 by Madame de Carpentier with most 

00:05:55.700 --> 00:05:57.490
 plants that are there flowers 

00:05:56.780 --> 00:06:00.470
 perennials 

00:05:57.490 --> 00:06:02.330
 we also try to respect everything 

00:06:00.470 --> 00:06:04.010
 what she did if you want 

00:06:02.330 --> 00:06:06.400
 try not to upset yourself too much 

00:06:04.010 --> 00:06:09.400
 see need to improve but 

00:06:06.400 --> 00:06:09.400
 reasonably 

00:06:11.520 --> 00:06:16.450
 you see in a garden like that of 

00:06:13.960 --> 00:06:18.850
 cannon transmission is really 

00:06:16.450 --> 00:06:20.020
 something very important and so 

00:06:18.850 --> 00:06:22.840
 today what we are trying to do 

00:06:20.020 --> 00:06:24.880
 it is to preserve the inheritance 

00:06:22.840 --> 00:06:27.460
 that we received the layout of this park 

00:06:24.880 --> 00:06:29.320
 also this creation of our aunt 

00:06:27.460 --> 00:06:31.960
 these magnificent masses of perennials 

00:06:29.320 --> 00:06:34.000
 we also of course have many 

00:06:31.960 --> 00:06:35.260
 projects and for example we would like 

00:06:34.000 --> 00:06:36.690
 only in his gardens 

00:06:35.260 --> 00:06:38.830
 visitors can again 

00:06:36.690 --> 00:06:40.480
 discover fruit trees in 

00:06:38.830 --> 00:06:43.030
 espalier as in the eighteenth century 

00:06:40.480 --> 00:06:44.730
 so we started replanting and that's 

00:06:43.030 --> 00:06:47.860
 something we would like 

00:06:44.730 --> 00:06:49.690
 genuinely developed afterwards to 

00:06:47.860 --> 00:06:53.230
 cannon the garden is so a matter of 

00:06:49.690 --> 00:06:54.670
 family for nearly 400 years and one 

00:06:53.230 --> 00:06:56.820
 hope it will remain so for 

00:06:54.670 --> 00:06:56.820
 long time 

00:07:01.980 --> 00:07:05.030
 ah ah
