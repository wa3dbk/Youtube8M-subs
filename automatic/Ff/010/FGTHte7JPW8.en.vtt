00:00:58.700 --> 00:00:58.710 
what type of t56 transmission this is so

00:00:58.710 --> 00:01:01.910 
what type of t56 transmission this is so
in<00:00:59.609> order<00:00:59.820> to<00:01:00.120> see<00:01:00.359> if<00:01:00.690> the<00:01:01.079> conversion<00:01:01.469> kit

00:01:01.910 --> 00:01:01.920 
in order to see if the conversion kit

00:01:01.920 --> 00:01:04.280 
in order to see if the conversion kit
for<00:01:01.949> this<00:01:02.280> would<00:01:02.550> work<00:01:02.820> I<00:01:03.149> actually<00:01:03.719> have<00:01:04.140> to

00:01:04.280 --> 00:01:04.290 
for this would work I actually have to

00:01:04.290 --> 00:01:06.260 
for this would work I actually have to
take<00:01:04.500> this<00:01:04.739> off<00:01:05.010> to<00:01:05.250> count<00:01:05.519> the<00:01:05.670> teeth<00:01:05.880> on<00:01:06.119> the

00:01:06.260 --> 00:01:06.270 
take this off to count the teeth on the

00:01:06.270 --> 00:01:10.130 
take this off to count the teeth on the
shaft<00:01:06.560> the<00:01:07.560> conversion<00:01:08.100> kit<00:01:08.630> will<00:01:09.630> work<00:01:09.659> if

00:01:10.130 --> 00:01:10.140 
shaft the conversion kit will work if

00:01:10.140 --> 00:01:13.010 
shaft the conversion kit will work if
the<00:01:10.740> teeth<00:01:11.010> on<00:01:11.280> the<00:01:11.520> bottom<00:01:11.700> end<00:01:12.000> of<00:01:12.180> this<00:01:12.270> has
