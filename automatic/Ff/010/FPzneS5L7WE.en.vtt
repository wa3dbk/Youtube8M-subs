00:00:04.010 --> 00:00:10.940
 Today we will teach you how to create a 

00:00:07.310 --> 00:00:14.420
 rubik cube with photos in photoshop good 

00:00:10.940 --> 00:00:17.180
 let's start first they have to have the 

00:00:14.420 --> 00:00:21.550

00:00:17.180 --> 00:00:21.550

00:00:21.680 --> 00:00:30.529
 then they have to open the photoshop 

00:00:26.539 --> 00:00:34.930
 that I'll open it good I'll pass it 

00:00:30.529 --> 00:00:34.930
 because I have it portable 

00:00:35.400 --> 00:00:42.060
 well we keep money April and you 

00:00:39.300 --> 00:00:45.300
 they have to follow my steps now they have 

00:00:42.060 --> 00:00:46.710
 that go to open file to see the cube 

00:00:45.300 --> 00:00:50.149
 rubik 

00:00:46.710 --> 00:00:50.149
 and they go where they have it 

00:00:54.990 --> 00:00:57.860
 and it will open 

00:01:00.270 --> 00:01:04.570
 walk 

00:01:02.170 --> 00:01:09.390
 then they have to open three images 

00:01:04.570 --> 00:01:09.390
 that I will open them from nick jonas 

00:01:11.690 --> 00:01:14.230

00:01:16.420 --> 00:01:19.590
 where are the others 

00:01:24.320 --> 00:01:29.350
 up here 

00:01:26.270 --> 00:01:29.350
 and they give him to open 

00:01:30.710 --> 00:01:36.229
 good if you want to open one by 

00:01:33.110 --> 00:01:38.900
 one but I 'm farming from three to no 

00:01:36.229 --> 00:01:43.729
 occupy so much good time for 

00:01:38.900 --> 00:01:47.680
 transfer them have to go here and put 

00:01:43.729 --> 00:01:47.680
 rectangular frame tool 

00:01:47.710 --> 00:01:53.580
 select the whole image and then 

00:01:50.740 --> 00:01:53.580
 control ce 

00:01:57.880 --> 00:02:02.520
 and then they go to the rubik cube and what 

00:02:00.130 --> 00:02:02.520
 stick 

00:02:02.830 --> 00:02:10.869
 then to modify it tighten control 

00:02:06.670 --> 00:02:12.909
 You do not enlarge it 

00:02:10.869 --> 00:02:15.489
 and to adjust it they have to keep 

00:02:12.909 --> 00:02:19.260
 tight control and with the mouse or tous 

00:02:15.489 --> 00:02:19.260
 to drag to the corners 

00:02:30.250 --> 00:02:36.280
 and this I already have the first image 

00:02:33.050 --> 00:02:36.280
 and then the other 

00:02:37.370 --> 00:02:42.129
 is this control yes 

00:02:43.310 --> 00:02:48.810
 lic 

00:02:44.730 --> 00:02:50.590
 and the pep or control I 'm going to enlarge 

00:02:48.810 --> 00:02:53.450
 a little 

00:02:50.590 --> 00:02:56.780
 now to adjust it 

00:02:53.450 --> 00:03:00.410
 with the continent tight control and 

00:02:56.780 --> 00:03:02.800
 move it with the touchpad or the mouse to the 

00:03:00.410 --> 00:03:02.800
 corners 

00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:16.540
 and there 

00:03:17.800 --> 00:03:21.390
 now the other image 

00:03:21.630 --> 00:03:30.000
 I'm not going to select everything because 

00:03:24.390 --> 00:03:32.360
 it would be uneven with twisting 

00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:36.020
 they minimize it 

00:03:32.360 --> 00:03:40.220
 al kurbi and contrast control for 

00:03:36.020 --> 00:03:43.670
 modify it enlarge a little bit with 

00:03:40.220 --> 00:03:46.450
 control plus the mouse or tous ton for 

00:03:43.670 --> 00:03:46.450
 adjust it 

00:03:56.630 --> 00:03:59.350
 good 

00:04:01.810 --> 00:04:10.260
 and there they would be left to save for 

00:04:05.739 --> 00:04:10.260
 save it they have to go to file 

00:04:10.930 --> 00:04:18.140

00:04:13.640 --> 00:04:21.140
