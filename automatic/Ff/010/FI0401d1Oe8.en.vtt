00:02:31.080 --> 00:02:31.090 
is the best defense

00:02:31.090 --> 00:02:34.290 
is the best defense
so<00:02:32.050> unlighted<00:02:32.560> b5<00:02:33.130> not<00:02:33.459> only<00:02:33.730> protecting<00:02:34.209> the

00:02:34.300 --> 00:02:41.270 
so unlighted b5 not only protecting the
pawn<00:02:34.569> but<00:02:35.230> aiming<00:02:35.709> at<00:02:35.860> c7<00:02:37.739> so<00:02:38.739> black<00:02:39.130> played<00:02:39.690> d5

00:02:41.270 --> 00:02:41.280 
pawn but aiming at c7 so black played d5

00:02:41.280 --> 00:02:45.360

so<00:02:42.280> Bishop<00:02:42.700> has<00:02:42.940> no<00:02:43.120> access<00:02:43.420> now<00:02:43.840> to<00:02:43.870> c7<00:02:44.530> if

00:02:45.360 --> 00:02:45.370 
so Bishop has no access now to c7 if

00:02:45.370 --> 00:02:47.280 
so Bishop has no access now to c7 if
Bishop<00:02:45.730> takes<00:02:46.150> the<00:02:46.390> knight<00:02:46.630> egg<00:02:46.870> so<00:02:47.049> that's

00:02:47.280 --> 00:02:47.290 
Bishop takes the knight egg so that's

00:02:47.290 --> 00:02:51.229

00:03:01.220 --> 00:03:01.230 
for white

00:03:01.230 --> 00:03:04.729 
for white
no<00:03:02.190> it's<00:03:02.520> not<00:03:02.700> because<00:03:02.989> he<00:03:03.989> can<00:03:04.140> continue<00:03:04.470> with

00:03:04.729 --> 00:03:04.739 
no it's not because he can continue with

00:03:04.739 --> 00:03:07.520 
no it's not because he can continue with
his<00:03:04.920> attack<00:03:05.250> pawn<00:03:05.970> takes<00:03:06.239> Knight<00:03:06.480> and<00:03:07.260> now

his attack pawn takes Knight and now

00:03:07.530 --> 00:03:12.070 
his attack pawn takes Knight and now
black<00:03:08.340> had<00:03:08.670> a<00:03:08.700> chance<00:03:09.060> to<00:03:09.300> capture<00:03:09.959> the<00:03:10.200> pawn

00:03:12.070 --> 00:03:12.080

black had a chance to capture the pawn
hidden<00:03:13.080> it<00:03:13.200> but<00:03:13.470> let's<00:03:13.709> check<00:03:14.010> what<00:03:14.190> will

00:03:14.330 --> 00:03:14.340 
hidden it but let's check what will

00:03:14.340 --> 00:03:16.460 
hidden it but let's check what will
happen<00:03:14.640> if<00:03:14.760> he<00:03:14.790> captured<00:03:15.300> the<00:03:15.390> phone<00:03:15.599> then<00:03:16.319> we

00:03:16.460 --> 00:03:16.470 
happen if he captured the phone then we

00:03:16.470 --> 00:03:17.479 
happen if he captured the phone then we
will<00:03:16.560> have<00:03:16.739> this<00:03:16.890> variation

00:03:17.479 --> 00:03:17.489 
will have this variation

00:03:17.489 --> 00:03:22.910 
will have this variation
Knight<00:03:18.060> to<00:03:18.239> c7<00:03:18.630> check<00:03:19.670> King<00:03:20.670> to<00:03:20.880> d8<00:03:21.620> why<00:03:22.620> not

00:03:22.910 --> 00:03:22.920 
Knight to c7 check King to d8 why not

00:03:22.920 --> 00:03:28.940 
Knight to c7 check King to d8 why not
why<00:03:23.790> not<00:03:23.819> King<00:03:24.300> to<00:03:24.650> e7<00:03:27.380> have<00:03:28.380> a<00:03:28.410> good<00:03:28.620> look<00:03:28.769> and

00:03:28.940 --> 00:03:28.950 
why not King to e7 have a good look and

00:03:28.950 --> 00:03:32.740 
why not King to e7 have a good look and
you<00:03:29.040> will<00:03:29.160> see<00:03:29.370> why<00:03:29.519> not<00:03:30.049> because<00:03:31.049> of<00:03:31.129> this<00:03:32.129> mob

00:03:32.740 --> 00:03:32.750 
you will see why not because of this mob

00:03:32.750 --> 00:03:35.229 
you will see why not because of this mob
winning<00:03:33.750> the<00:03:33.900> Queen

00:03:35.229 --> 00:03:35.239 
winning the Queen

00:03:35.239 --> 00:03:38.930 
winning the Queen
so<00:03:36.239> King<00:03:36.510> to<00:03:36.690> d8<00:03:36.870> was<00:03:37.170> played<00:03:37.489> by<00:03:38.489> then<00:03:38.670> Knight

00:03:38.930 --> 00:03:38.940 
so King to d8 was played by then Knight

00:03:38.940 --> 00:03:42.860 
so King to d8 was played by then Knight
to<00:03:39.090> f7<00:03:39.540> and<00:03:40.220> eventually<00:03:41.220> King<00:03:41.489> must<00:03:41.700> go<00:03:41.910> to<00:03:41.970> e7

00:03:42.860 --> 00:03:42.870 
to f7 and eventually King must go to e7

00:03:42.870 --> 00:03:46.309 
to f7 and eventually King must go to e7
so<00:03:43.650> white<00:03:43.890> can<00:03:44.130> capture<00:03:44.910> the<00:03:45.150> rook<00:03:45.299> or<00:03:45.900> he<00:03:46.140> can

00:03:46.309 --> 00:03:46.319 
so white can capture the rook or he can

00:03:46.319 --> 00:03:50.360 
so white can capture the rook or he can
go<00:03:46.470> again<00:03:46.739> for<00:03:47.010> d5<00:03:47.610> and<00:03:47.849> win<00:03:48.630> the<00:03:48.780> Queen<00:03:49.370> so

00:03:50.360 --> 00:03:50.370 
go again for d5 and win the Queen so

00:03:50.370 --> 00:03:54.280 
go again for d5 and win the Queen so
this<00:03:50.579> variation<00:03:50.910> is<00:03:51.860> losing<00:03:52.970> for<00:03:53.970> black

00:03:54.280 --> 00:03:54.290 
this variation is losing for black

00:03:54.290 --> 00:03:58.009 
this variation is losing for black
that's<00:03:55.290> why<00:03:55.470> he<00:03:55.620> played<00:03:55.769> pin<00:03:56.099> to<00:03:56.280> b5<00:03:56.840> but<00:03:57.840> then

00:03:58.009 --> 00:03:58.019 
that's why he played pin to b5 but then

00:03:58.019 --> 00:04:01.640 
that's why he played pin to b5 but then
he<00:03:58.290> lost<00:03:59.220> even<00:03:59.430> suna<00:03:59.970> it<00:04:00.420> is<00:04:00.750> white<00:04:01.290> to<00:04:01.500> play

00:04:01.640 --> 00:04:01.650 
he lost even suna it is white to play

00:04:01.650 --> 00:04:05.410 
he lost even suna it is white to play
and<00:04:02.099> to<00:04:02.700> give<00:04:02.880> checkmate<00:04:03.390> in<00:04:03.750> two<00:04:04.410> moves
