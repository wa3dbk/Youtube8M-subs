00:03:12.530 --> 00:03:12.540 
crossover and then I go to 3 first so I

00:03:12.540 --> 00:03:14.240 
crossover and then I go to 3 first so I
can<00:03:12.630> perform<00:03:13.050> a<00:03:13.140> crossover<00:03:13.530> with<00:03:13.680> the<00:03:13.860> feast

00:03:14.240 --> 00:03:14.250 
can perform a crossover with the feast

00:03:14.250 --> 00:03:18.290 
can perform a crossover with the feast
to<00:03:14.670> go<00:03:14.820> to<00:03:14.880> the<00:03:15.240> second<00:03:15.990> finger<00:03:16.520> second<00:03:17.520> first

00:03:18.290 --> 00:03:18.300
