00:01:28.070 --> 00:01:28.080 
a I can pull that out now it's too short

00:01:28.080 --> 00:01:31.820 
a I can pull that out now it's too short
you<00:01:29.080> can<00:01:29.170> see<00:01:29.289> some<00:01:29.440> areas<00:01:29.619> over<00:01:29.740> here<00:01:30.160> or<00:01:30.310> the

the nail never in penetrating the joist

00:01:35.670 --> 00:01:39.779 
the nail never in penetrating the joist
so<00:01:36.670> once<00:01:36.819> again<00:01:36.940> it's<00:01:37.149> a<00:01:37.209> failure<00:01:37.479> there<00:01:38.789> this

00:01:39.779 --> 00:01:39.789 
so once again it's a failure there this

are not angered in the concrete what
happened<00:01:57.759> there<00:01:57.940> is<00:01:58.239> if<00:01:59.369> the<00:02:00.369> moisture<00:02:00.729> can

00:02:02.790 --> 00:02:02.800 
cause a wood the rod deteriorate quicker

00:02:02.800 --> 00:02:06.300 
cause a wood the rod deteriorate quicker
than<00:02:03.009> you<00:02:03.160> would<00:02:03.310> like<00:02:04.289> also<00:02:05.289> if<00:02:05.619> they're<00:02:06.039> if

00:02:06.300 --> 00:02:06.310 
than you would like also if they're if

00:02:06.310 --> 00:02:10.229 
than you would like also if they're if
they're<00:02:06.459> nesting<00:02:06.849> it<00:02:07.229> deep<00:02:08.229> enough<00:02:08.560> for<00:02:09.239> the

00:02:10.229 --> 00:02:10.239 
they're nesting it deep enough for the

00:02:10.239 --> 00:02:12.050 
they're nesting it deep enough for the
frost<00:02:10.479> level<00:02:10.869> you<00:02:10.959> can<00:02:11.080> get<00:02:11.170> some<00:02:11.319> so<00:02:11.500> heaving

00:02:12.050 --> 00:02:12.060 
frost level you can get some so heaving

00:02:12.060 --> 00:02:13.979 
frost level you can get some so heaving
which<00:02:13.060> means<00:02:13.299> they'll<00:02:13.420> move<00:02:13.569> up<00:02:13.750> and<00:02:13.840> down

00:02:13.979 --> 00:02:13.989 
which means they'll move up and down

00:02:13.989 --> 00:02:16.800 
which means they'll move up and down
with<00:02:14.260> it<00:02:14.290> was<00:02:14.469> a<00:02:14.760> weather<00:02:15.760> as<00:02:16.000> it<00:02:16.209> freezes<00:02:16.480> and

00:02:16.800 --> 00:02:16.810 
with it was a weather as it freezes and

00:02:16.810 --> 00:02:17.820 
with it was a weather as it freezes and
thaws<00:02:16.870> and

00:02:17.820 --> 00:02:17.830 
thaws and

00:02:17.830 --> 00:02:20.670 
thaws and
that<00:02:17.950> can<00:02:18.130> can<00:02:18.640> help<00:02:18.820> cause<00:02:19.030> uh<00:02:19.500> pulling<00:02:20.500> away
