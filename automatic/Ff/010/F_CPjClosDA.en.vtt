00:00:08.069 --> 00:00:12.900
 human papillomavirus vph this virus

 humans because of warts 

00:00:19.920 --> 00:00:25.320
 that result from ph is often referred to 

00:00:23.100 --> 00:00:27.390
 like the wart virus the 

00:00:25.320 --> 00:00:29.490
 genital warts are warts more 

00:00:27.390 --> 00:00:31.890

 the reason that when it comes to eliminating

 wart can often be very painful 

00:00:44.610 --> 00:00:49.620
 the wart is attached to the capillaries 

00:00:46.440 --> 00:00:51.989
 embedded in the skin the warts will 

00:00:49.620 --> 00:00:53.699
 propagate when an uninfected area of 

00:00:51.989 --> 00:00:55.800
 the skin comes in contact with the area 

00:00:53.699 --> 00:00:57.510
 infected either by direct contact 

00:00:55.800 --> 00:01:00.210
 by contact with skin cells 

00:00:57.510 --> 00:01:01.949
 detached from the wart by luck

00:01:15.060 --> 00:01:19.860

00:01:17.400 --> 00:01:21.510
 process is somewhat painful and uncomfortable but
