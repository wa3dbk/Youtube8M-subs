00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.319
 and biblical studies the art of serving 

00:00:03.750 --> 00:00:09.420
 look for your bible and we start this study 

00:00:06.319 --> 00:00:12.330
 answer to a common question question 

00:00:09.420 --> 00:00:15.330
 God will continue to forgive you if you commit the 

00:00:12.330 --> 00:00:17.490
 same sin again and again response 

00:00:15.330 --> 00:00:20.340
 to better answer this question 

00:00:17.490 --> 00:00:23.130
 let's see two powerful passages of the 

00:00:20.340 --> 00:00:25.830
 scriptures the first one is in the 

00:00:23.130 --> 00:00:28.170
 book of the psalms how far is the 

00:00:25.830 --> 00:00:31.590
 east of the west did away from 

00:00:28.170 --> 00:00:35.550
 we our rebellions psalms 103 

00:00:31.590 --> 00:00:37.890
 12 one of the most effective tricks that 

00:00:35.550 --> 00:00:40.230
 satan tries with the Christians is 

00:00:37.890 --> 00:00:42.809
 convince them that our sins do not 

00:00:40.230 --> 00:00:45.480
 are really forgiven despite the 

00:00:42.809 --> 00:00:47.670
 promises of the word of God if 

00:00:45.480 --> 00:00:49.829
 We have truly received Jesus 

00:00:47.670 --> 00:00:51.780
 as a savior by faith and still 

00:00:49.829 --> 00:00:54.360
 we have an uncomfortable feeling 

00:00:51.780 --> 00:00:56.399
 asking if there is a true forgiveness or not 

00:00:54.360 --> 00:00:57.860
 this can come from influences 

00:00:56.399 --> 00:01:00.200
 demonic 

00:00:57.860 --> 00:01:02.630
 the demons hate it when people are 

00:01:00.200 --> 00:01:04.400
 rescued from their reach and try to 

00:01:02.630 --> 00:01:05.960
 sow seeds of doubt in our 

00:01:04.400 --> 00:01:08.900
 minds of the reality of our 

00:01:05.960 --> 00:01:11.330
 salvation in his vast arsenal of tricks 

00:01:08.900 --> 00:01:13.970
 one of the biggest tools in 

00:01:11.330 --> 00:01:16.310
 satan is to remind us constantly of 

00:01:13.970 --> 00:01:18.470
 our past transgressions and the 

00:01:16.310 --> 00:01:21.320
 used to prove that God could not 

00:01:18.470 --> 00:01:23.270
 forgive or restore attacks from 

00:01:21.320 --> 00:01:25.850
 Devil does it in a real challenge 

00:01:23.270 --> 00:01:27.770
 for us to simply rest in 

00:01:25.850 --> 00:01:30.320
 the promises of god and trust in his 

00:01:27.770 --> 00:01:32.300
 love but this psalm also tells us 

00:01:30.320 --> 00:01:35.000
 that God not only forgives our 

00:01:32.300 --> 00:01:37.820
 sins but it removes them completely 

00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:41.030
 of his presence this is something profound 

00:01:37.820 --> 00:01:42.890
 without a doubt this is a concept 

00:01:41.030 --> 00:01:45.140
 difficult to grasp for humans 

00:01:42.890 --> 00:01:47.450
 that's why it's so easy for us 

00:01:45.140 --> 00:01:49.610
 worry and ask about the 

00:01:47.450 --> 00:01:52.520
 sorry instead of just accepting it 

00:01:49.610 --> 00:01:54.530
 the key lies in simply giving up 

00:01:52.520 --> 00:01:56.960
 to our doubts and our feelings 

00:01:54.530 --> 00:01:59.360
 of guilt and resting in their 

00:01:56.960 --> 00:02:02.330
 promises of forgiveness another passage is 

00:01:59.360 --> 00:02:04.850
 first of juan 19 if we confess 

00:02:02.330 --> 00:02:06.950
 our sins he is faithful and just 

00:02:04.850 --> 00:02:09.979
 forgive our sins and cleanse us 

00:02:06.950 --> 00:02:13.010
 of all evil what an incredible promise 

00:02:09.979 --> 00:02:14.900
 God forgives his children when they sin 

00:02:13.010 --> 00:02:17.959
 they only come to him in an attitude of 

00:02:14.900 --> 00:02:20.209
 repentance and ask for forgiveness the grace 

00:02:17.959 --> 00:02:22.250
 God is so big that he can clean 

00:02:20.209 --> 00:02:24.130
 the sinner of his sin so that he 

00:02:22.250 --> 00:02:27.140
 become a son of god 

00:02:24.130 --> 00:02:32.500
 even when we stumble we can be 

00:02:27.140 --> 00:02:35.090
 forgiven still in matteo 18 21 22 we read 

00:02:32.500 --> 00:02:37.760
 then he approached him but and told him 

00:02:35.090 --> 00:02:40.459
 mister how many times will I forgive my 

00:02:37.760 --> 00:02:43.700
 brother who sins against me up to seven 

00:02:40.459 --> 00:02:46.269
 Jesus told him I do not tell you until seven 

00:02:43.700 --> 00:02:48.769
 but still up to 70 times 7 pedro 

00:02:46.269 --> 00:02:51.500
 I was probably thinking I was 

00:02:48.769 --> 00:02:53.630
 being generous instead of paying with 

00:02:51.500 --> 00:02:55.910
 equal pay to a person who 

00:02:53.630 --> 00:02:58.010
 he had committed a sin against him 

00:02:55.910 --> 00:03:00.620
 Pedro suggested giving the brother some 

00:02:58.010 --> 00:03:03.380
 maneuver margin say up to seven 

00:03:00.620 --> 00:03:06.140
 times but forgiveness and 

00:03:03.380 --> 00:03:08.239
 grace the eighth time but christ 

00:03:06.140 --> 00:03:10.700
 challenge the rules of the economy of 

00:03:08.239 --> 00:03:11.510
 grace suggested by pedro saying that 

00:03:10.700 --> 00:03:13.340
 forgiveness is 

00:03:11.510 --> 00:03:16.340
 finite for those who really do 

00:03:13.340 --> 00:03:18.439
 are looking for this is only possible by 

00:03:16.340 --> 00:03:20.120
 the infinite grace of God that is made 

00:03:18.439 --> 00:03:22.730
 possible through the shed blood 

00:03:20.120 --> 00:03:25.220
 of Christ on the cross for power 

00:03:22.730 --> 00:03:27.439
 forgiveness of Christ we can always be 

00:03:25.220 --> 00:03:30.319
 clean facts after sin if 

00:03:27.439 --> 00:03:32.720
 We humbly seek it at the same time 

00:03:30.319 --> 00:03:34.610
 it must be observed that it is not biblical 

00:03:32.720 --> 00:03:36.860
 for a person to sin habitually and 

00:03:34.610 --> 00:03:40.450
 continuously as a lifestyle and 

00:03:36.860 --> 00:03:43.940
 still be a first believer of juan 

00:03:40.450 --> 00:03:46.579
 389 for this reason pablo admonishes 

00:03:43.940 --> 00:03:49.879
 examine yourselves if you are 

00:03:46.579 --> 00:03:52.430
 in faith proven yourselves or not 

00:03:49.879 --> 00:03:54.920
 you know yourselves that 

00:03:52.430 --> 00:03:59.299
 Jesus Christ is in you unless you 

00:03:54.920 --> 00:04:02.659
 you are reproved 2nd Corinthians 13 5 

00:03:59.299 --> 00:04:05.209
 as Christians we stumble but not 

00:04:02.659 --> 00:04:07.760
 we live a life of continuous sin without 

00:04:05.209 --> 00:04:10.700
 repentance all of us have 

00:04:07.760 --> 00:04:13.340
 weaknesses and we can fall into sin yet 

00:04:10.700 --> 00:04:15.409
 when we do not want to do even the 

00:04:13.340 --> 00:04:17.269
 Apostle Paul did what he did not want 

00:04:15.409 --> 00:04:18.260
 to do for the sin that worked from his 

00:04:17.269 --> 00:04:22.340
 body 

00:04:18.260 --> 00:04:25.130
 715 as Paul the response of the believer 

00:04:22.340 --> 00:04:27.350
 is to hate sin to repent of it 

00:04:25.130 --> 00:04:32.600
 and ask for the divine grace to overcome it 

00:04:27.350 --> 00:04:34.940
 Romans 7 24 25 although we do not 

00:04:32.600 --> 00:04:37.130
 we need to fall because of enough 

00:04:34.940 --> 00:04:39.190
 Grace of God 'sometimes we do 

00:04:37.130 --> 00:04:41.750
 because we trust in our strength 

00:04:39.190 --> 00:04:44.540
 insufficient when our faith is 

00:04:41.750 --> 00:04:46.700
 weakens and as Peter we deny our 

00:04:44.540 --> 00:04:48.470
 Lord in word or in life still 

00:04:46.700 --> 00:04:50.890
 there is still an opportunity to repent 

00:04:48.470 --> 00:04:53.390
 and be forgiven of our sins 

00:04:50.890 --> 00:04:55.850
 another one of satan's tricks is 

00:04:53.390 --> 00:04:57.530
 make us think that there is no hope that 

00:04:55.850 --> 00:04:59.870
 there is no possibility that 

00:04:57.530 --> 00:05:01.310
 we can be forgiven healed and 

00:04:59.870 --> 00:05:03.590
 restored 

00:05:01.310 --> 00:05:05.750
 he will try to make us feel consumed 

00:05:03.590 --> 00:05:08.050
 and trapped by guilt so that we do not 

00:05:05.750 --> 00:05:11.150
 let's be worthy already of God's forgiveness 

00:05:08.050 --> 00:05:14.360
 but since when we were worthy of the 

00:05:11.150 --> 00:05:16.730
 grace of god god loved us forgave us 

00:05:14.360 --> 00:05:20.780
 and he chose us to be in Christ before 

00:05:16.730 --> 00:05:23.450
 of the foundation of the world Ephesians 146 

00:05:20.780 --> 00:05:25.430
 not for anything that we did but to 

00:05:23.450 --> 00:05:27.410
 order that we be to praise his 

00:05:25.430 --> 00:05:31.580
 glory us those who first 

00:05:27.410 --> 00:05:33.590
 We were waiting in Christ Ephesians 112 

00:05:31.580 --> 00:05:36.260
 we must always keep in mind 

00:05:33.590 --> 00:05:38.780
 that there is no place where we can go that the 

00:05:36.260 --> 00:05:40.790
 grace of God can not reach us and 

00:05:38.780 --> 00:05:43.070
 there is no depth to which we 

00:05:40.790 --> 00:05:46.370
 we can sink that god is no longer capable 

00:05:43.070 --> 00:05:49.190
 to get us out of grace is greater than all 

00:05:46.370 --> 00:05:51.530
 our sins if we are newly 

00:05:49.190 --> 00:05:53.930
 starting to wander or we are already sinking 

00:05:51.530 --> 00:05:56.600
 us and drowning us in our sin the 

00:05:53.930 --> 00:05:57.980
 grace can be received grace is 

00:05:56.600 --> 00:06:02.090
 a gift from god 

00:05:57.980 --> 00:06:04.220
 Ephesians 28 when we sin the spirit 

00:06:02.090 --> 00:06:07.070
 will convince us of sin in such a way 

00:06:04.220 --> 00:06:11.210
 that a sadness according to God will result 2 

00:06:07.070 --> 00:06:12.860
 Corinthians 7 10 11 He will not condemn 

00:06:11.210 --> 00:06:14.900
 our souls as if there were no 

00:06:12.860 --> 00:06:16.970
 hope because there is no longer 

00:06:14.900 --> 00:06:20.660
 condemnation for those who are in Christ 

00:06:16.970 --> 00:06:22.430
 jesus romanos 8 1 the conviction of 

00:06:20.660 --> 00:06:25.130
 spirit within us is a 

00:06:22.430 --> 00:06:28.300
 movement of love and grace grace does not 

00:06:25.130 --> 00:06:32.210
 it is an excuse to sin roman 

00:06:28.300 --> 00:06:34.190
 612 and you should not dare to be abused what 

00:06:32.210 --> 00:06:36.830
 which means that the sin must be 

00:06:34.190 --> 00:06:39.860
 called sin and can not be treated 

00:06:36.830 --> 00:06:42.110
 as if it is harmless harmless believers 

00:06:39.860 --> 00:06:44.600
 fickle need to be lovingly 

00:06:42.110 --> 00:06:46.370
 confronted and guided to freedom and 

00:06:44.600 --> 00:06:47.840
 the unbelievers that we tell them that 

00:06:46.370 --> 00:06:50.900
 they need to repent 

00:06:47.840 --> 00:06:53.120
 but we also emphasize the remedy 

00:06:50.900 --> 00:06:57.110
 because grace has been given us 

00:06:53.120 --> 00:06:59.540
 grace joan 116 grace is like 

00:06:57.110 --> 00:07:01.940
 we live as we are saved 

00:06:59.540 --> 00:07:04.940
 how we are sanctified and how we will be 

00:07:01.940 --> 00:07:07.310
 saved and glorified we receive 

00:07:04.940 --> 00:07:10.490
 grace when we sin for repenting 

00:07:07.310 --> 00:07:12.860
 and confess our sins goodbye because 

00:07:10.490 --> 00:07:15.200
 live a sinful life when Christ 

00:07:12.860 --> 00:07:18.169
 offers to make us spiritually healthy and 

00:07:15.200 --> 00:07:22.990
