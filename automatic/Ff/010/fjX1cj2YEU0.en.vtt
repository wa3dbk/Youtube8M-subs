aside<00:02:48.139> in<00:02:49.150> an<00:02:50.150> instant<00:02:50.630> that<00:02:51.049> means<00:02:51.319> spin<00:02:51.829> and

00:02:52.319 --> 00:02:52.329 
aside in an instant that means spin and

00:02:52.329 --> 00:02:56.589 
aside in an instant that means spin and
if<00:02:53.329> it<00:02:53.829> it<00:02:54.829> takes<00:02:55.010> a<00:02:55.130> little<00:02:55.340> time<00:02:55.609> to<00:02:55.669> get<00:02:56.269> to

00:02:56.589 --> 00:02:56.599 
if it it takes a little time to get to

00:02:56.599 --> 00:02:59.379 
if it it takes a little time to get to
the<00:02:56.630> sides<00:02:57.620> then<00:02:58.130> you<00:02:58.400> know<00:02:58.549> that<00:02:58.579> it's<00:02:59.030> medium

00:02:59.379 --> 00:02:59.389 
the sides then you know that it's medium

00:02:59.389 --> 00:03:02.710 
the sides then you know that it's medium
and<00:02:59.660> thick<00:03:00.349> or<00:03:00.709> stiff<00:03:01.069> it<00:03:01.970> just<00:03:02.269> won't<00:03:02.480> even

00:03:02.710 --> 00:03:02.720 
and thick or stiff it just won't even

00:03:02.720 --> 00:03:05.440 
and thick or stiff it just won't even
move<00:03:03.019> so<00:03:03.799> if<00:03:04.099> you're<00:03:04.430> icing<00:03:04.970> is

00:03:05.440 --> 00:03:05.450 
move so if you're icing is

00:03:05.450 --> 00:03:07.180 
move so if you're icing is
music<00:03:05.810> you<00:03:06.349> probably<00:03:06.590> want<00:03:06.830> to<00:03:06.860> add<00:03:07.010> a<00:03:07.040> little

00:03:07.180 --> 00:03:07.190

00:03:12.699 --> 00:03:12.709 
they both work the same way I probably

00:03:12.709 --> 00:03:15.670 
they both work the same way I probably
do<00:03:13.040> it<00:03:13.069> about<00:03:13.550> 1<00:03:14.180> to<00:03:14.300> 2<00:03:14.330> teaspoons<00:03:15.080> at<00:03:15.260> a<00:03:15.290> time
