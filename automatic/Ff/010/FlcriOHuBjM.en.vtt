00:00:09.969 --> 00:00:14.119
 to value beauty that can not 

00:00:11.930 --> 00:00:16.640
 happen and I bring another boxing here 

00:00:14.119 --> 00:00:19.580
 on the show only take that already 

00:00:16.640 --> 00:00:23.960
 plastic injected into the chin 

00:00:19.580 --> 00:00:26.660
 camera shows that of the 6 240 m of the cooler 

00:00:23.960 --> 00:00:27.380
 master here a commercial side appeal 

00:00:26.660 --> 00:00:28.730
 right 

00:00:27.380 --> 00:00:30.500
 When I say senate, you do not need 

00:00:28.730 --> 00:00:32.570
 maintenance, right? 

00:00:30.500 --> 00:00:34.340
 you can set up your computer and 

00:00:32.570 --> 00:00:36.620
 install cute and not worry 

00:00:34.340 --> 00:00:39.739
 with liquid exchange or anything is a 

00:00:36.620 --> 00:00:42.350
 cleaning every 6 months in the 

00:00:39.739 --> 00:00:43.999
 radiator remove them suggesting the 

00:00:42.350 --> 00:00:47.780
 conquering alone is pretty cool 

00:00:43.999 --> 00:00:50.420
 so here being 240 m in that reference 

00:00:47.780 --> 00:00:52.699
 of the 40's would be if you see 

00:00:50.420 --> 00:00:56.569
 the radiator never between the two is that 

00:00:52.699 --> 00:00:59.659
 speaking the fan 125 of the fan 120 

00:00:56.569 --> 00:01:03.889
 40 minutes still a radiator of 240 

00:00:59.659 --> 00:01:07.040
 mm would 2d is 120 in 

00:01:03.889 --> 00:01:09.080
 case of two fans of 120 developing 

00:01:07.040 --> 00:01:11.330
 here it shows the main movies, right? 

00:01:09.080 --> 00:01:12.950
 free from maintenance or intense cold and 

00:01:11.330 --> 00:01:18.080
 design for a retouch right 

00:01:12.950 --> 00:01:20.480
 and speaking here of the dodo area of 

00:01:18.080 --> 00:01:23.870
 Radiator how it works in this that is 

00:01:20.480 --> 00:01:25.970
 nothing much like that, but they give liquidity 

00:01:23.870 --> 00:01:28.850
 and look no 

00:01:25.970 --> 00:01:31.430
 the box thinks big there is nothing 

00:01:28.850 --> 00:01:33.260
 side box here showing how 

00:01:31.430 --> 00:01:35.840
 want the basis of contact with a 

00:01:33.260 --> 00:01:37.220
 processor that is copper 

00:01:35.840 --> 00:01:40.700
 for those who do not know is a great driver 

00:01:37.220 --> 00:01:42.560
 by dissipating very quickly the 

00:01:40.700 --> 00:01:45.770
 Heat here talking a little bit in 

00:01:42.560 --> 00:01:48.680
 languages in the dimensions of the 

00:01:45.770 --> 00:01:51.020
 block pump is that the gasket is pump plus 

00:01:48.680 --> 00:01:53.030
 block that makes the input and output of 

00:01:51.020 --> 00:01:54.890
 water into the radiator on the radiator 

00:01:53.030 --> 00:01:56.330
 on top of the right size tanks 

00:01:54.890 --> 00:01:59.300
 rock on the side 

00:01:56.330 --> 00:02:03.530
 more information about pump flow 

00:01:59.300 --> 00:02:08.080
 the noise of the right fan is among others 

00:02:03.530 --> 00:02:10.970
 data right from the pump intake and stuff 

00:02:08.080 --> 00:02:13.910
 Come on, there's nothing else, it's not 

00:02:10.970 --> 00:02:20.720
 That's it, people. Let's open it here. 

00:02:13.910 --> 00:02:23.210
 china does not come sealed disagreement of 

00:02:20.720 --> 00:02:24.860
 accompany some of our boxes and another 

00:02:23.210 --> 00:02:27.500
 have noticed that the box but will not 

00:02:24.860 --> 00:02:30.860
 make a crowd always in that format 

00:02:27.500 --> 00:02:33.350
 here more or less horton as they see how 

00:02:30.860 --> 00:02:36.890
 the 40s the two fans it comes with 

00:02:33.350 --> 00:02:40.280
 two points had this funk is a focus 

00:02:36.890 --> 00:02:44.510
 Very cool, no tv, no box or 

00:02:40.280 --> 00:02:49.040
 pressure it has 86.15 cfm well 

00:02:44.510 --> 00:02:51.860
 nigga goes from 602 thousand and 400 rpm to do 

00:02:49.040 --> 00:02:54.980
 one will do very bad of the new format 

00:02:51.860 --> 00:02:57.230
 aac of fan alerts but what should 

00:02:54.980 --> 00:02:59.510
 do some tests here and talk to you 

00:02:57.230 --> 00:03:01.670
 a detail that the young cable carried is 

00:02:59.510 --> 00:03:04.000
 very cool is pretty well there for 

00:03:01.670 --> 00:03:06.260
 pack the cabinet then there are two fans 

00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:08.350
 Equalities of both with cars 

00:03:06.260 --> 00:03:10.910
 derivatives of 120 

00:03:08.350 --> 00:03:12.830
 here the manuals talk about it does not have 

00:03:10.910 --> 00:03:15.500
 Secret is there, this is where we go. 

00:03:12.830 --> 00:03:19.070
 It is showing how the installation in 

00:03:15.500 --> 00:03:23.959
 next video here the huge amount 

00:03:19.070 --> 00:03:25.640
 screws thermal paste all for you 

00:03:23.959 --> 00:03:29.690
 to be able to do so much and gave me 

00:03:25.640 --> 00:03:37.340
 account then it is once that if in front 

00:03:29.690 --> 00:03:40.550
 on the back of all what the 

00:03:37.340 --> 00:03:44.180
 lady then then give it already 2011 by 

00:03:40.550 --> 00:03:46.400
 the 75 and can install it right and I 

00:03:44.180 --> 00:03:48.920
 I just want you to give me fm2 plus fm2 

00:03:46.400 --> 00:03:50.330
 fm3 plus m3 e92 at last will not have 

00:03:48.920 --> 00:03:52.310
 no problem and even the new 

00:03:50.330 --> 00:03:53.989
 planned 2011 update will also 

00:03:52.310 --> 00:03:56.300
 work here with your quiet now 

00:03:53.989 --> 00:03:59.660
 his greatest concern is not with the 

00:03:56.300 --> 00:04:01.850
 intel motherboard socket 

00:03:59.660 --> 00:04:04.280
 series that is using the i5 processor 

00:04:01.850 --> 00:04:08.480
 his office is that it has a nice space 

00:04:04.280 --> 00:04:10.220
 there to rent them and radiator that uses 

00:04:08.480 --> 00:04:13.150
 240 mm 

00:04:10.220 --> 00:04:13.150
 Let me get it out of here. 

00:04:14.300 --> 00:04:27.990
 there's nothing left 

00:04:17.730 --> 00:04:30.440
 The key was good people here is the 

00:04:27.990 --> 00:04:34.290
 good radiator so you are seeing 

00:04:30.440 --> 00:04:36.419
 Cheida to serve on a radiator as 

00:04:34.290 --> 00:04:38.490
 one of 240 mm, right? 

00:04:36.419 --> 00:04:39.870
 it has a thickness and standard is not 

00:04:38.490 --> 00:04:43.800
 very thick and not too thin 

00:04:39.870 --> 00:04:46.770
 very well finished 

00:04:43.800 --> 00:04:49.050
 There is not much secret here. I still use it. 

00:04:46.770 --> 00:04:53.340
 this type of hose a very 

00:04:49.050 --> 00:04:56.610
 well this way here she's 16 in the 

00:04:53.340 --> 00:04:59.340
 Very good city then you will talk 

00:04:56.610 --> 00:04:59.790
 so she will come here from the side to the 

00:04:59.340 --> 00:05:02.310
 other 

00:04:59.790 --> 00:05:04.950
 there's no problem, there's no risk 

00:05:02.310 --> 00:05:07.979
 leak is actually made to this 

00:05:04.950 --> 00:05:12.690
 kind of movement is not why she 

00:05:07.979 --> 00:05:15.180
 has this feature here and now 

00:05:12.690 --> 00:05:17.220
 the cable here we're going to feed 

00:05:15.180 --> 00:05:19.260
 Good crowd, too. 

00:05:17.220 --> 00:05:21.090
 this is really cool because it is beautiful one 

00:05:19.260 --> 00:05:22.979
 car with the wife now can hide 

00:05:21.090 --> 00:05:25.890
 it we fit the motherboard to give 

00:05:22.979 --> 00:05:28.710
 to make a half zzinho hide is but he 

00:05:25.890 --> 00:05:30.990
 is on the high side what appears 

00:05:28.710 --> 00:05:36.470
 Beautiful, you will not get much out of the context. 

00:05:30.990 --> 00:05:36.470
 of the will then we perceive it here 

00:05:37.310 --> 00:05:42.419
 written 

00:05:38.640 --> 00:05:45.840
 but having my own good, she's all 

00:05:42.419 --> 00:05:52.380
 stylized here on December 1 

00:05:45.840 --> 00:05:56.010
 It's cool here. 

00:05:52.380 --> 00:05:59.100
 so the water enters the water comes out 

00:05:56.010 --> 00:06:01.560
 the whole base here of snakes are watching 

00:05:59.100 --> 00:06:03.210
 makes dissipation helps in dissipation 

00:06:01.560 --> 00:06:06.900
 in this heat exchange 

00:06:03.210 --> 00:06:09.990
 then the water comes geladinha beats here in 

00:06:06.900 --> 00:06:12.000
 base retains the heat has not been dissipated 

00:06:09.990 --> 00:06:14.820
 back the radiator is to risk again 

00:06:12.000 --> 00:06:17.729
 with the help of the fans, bob is in this 

00:06:14.820 --> 00:06:21.450
 Galley cycle and so does the 

00:06:17.729 --> 00:06:24.810
 anticipation is because it is a fast cycle, 

00:06:21.450 --> 00:06:25.440
 water-based goes well with the temperature 

00:06:24.810 --> 00:06:27.840
 low 

00:06:25.440 --> 00:06:30.060
 so I am quiet extends to a 

00:06:27.840 --> 00:06:32.670
 much lower temperature is much more 

00:06:30.060 --> 00:06:35.940
 low that the courses are right 

00:06:32.670 --> 00:06:38.250
 so to speak of them and besides having a 

00:06:35.940 --> 00:06:40.440
 good result looks beautiful cabinet is 

00:06:38.250 --> 00:06:43.710
 You needed to talk to me, you were 

00:06:40.440 --> 00:06:45.810
 have healing is about 1 120 240 is 

00:06:43.710 --> 00:06:47.970
 Pretty computer calls a lot more. 

00:06:45.810 --> 00:06:50.270
 attention and then you want to get one 

00:06:47.970 --> 00:06:53.100
 new touch dry company company with a 

00:06:50.270 --> 00:06:55.560
 locked processor to make only the 

00:06:53.100 --> 00:06:57.390
 overclockers without any problem and 

00:06:55.560 --> 00:06:58.920
 You do not know about overclocking but want a 

00:06:57.390 --> 00:07:00.960
 Most beautiful design the temperature there 

00:06:58.920 --> 00:07:02.430
 underneath no noise on pc 

00:07:00.960 --> 00:07:05.060
 you can also make use of a system 

00:07:02.430 --> 00:07:09.600
 since Lebanon there are several other models 

00:07:05.060 --> 00:07:12.960
 cheaper is anyway has everything 

00:07:09.600 --> 00:07:13.890
 kind of pride to attend to the whole 

00:07:12.960 --> 00:07:15.930
 demand 

00:07:13.890 --> 00:07:17.790
 if you have a cabinet other than each 

00:07:15.930 --> 00:07:20.550
 of them you can use the 120 without problem 

00:07:17.790 --> 00:07:22.940
 some beauty so if here was a box 

00:07:20.550 --> 00:07:27.300
 even the cooler master's healing actor 

00:07:22.940 --> 00:07:40.580
 another pretty good that 240 m do not know of the 

00:07:27.300 --> 00:07:44.370
 40's in which the pump eyebrow 

00:07:40.580 --> 00:07:46.590
 little beauty so staying here we 

00:07:44.370 --> 00:07:48.720
 should have some videos showing how it is 

00:07:46.590 --> 00:07:51.150
 What does the installation do is have a lot of people 

00:07:48.720 --> 00:07:52.230
 which asks for and also some tests 

00:07:51.150 --> 00:07:54.870
 Temperature Let's see if people 

00:07:52.230 --> 00:07:56.850
 Can you bring beauty so a hug to 

00:07:54.870 --> 00:07:59.660
 everyone there until the next video was worth 

00:07:56.850 --> 00:07:59.660
 shaw
