 I'm going to teach you 

00:00:33.740 --> 00:00:37.520
 the sphere is made up of a multitude of 

00:00:35.900 --> 00:00:40.130
 small squares that simulate the 

00:00:37.520 --> 00:00:42.860

 coated stainless and as you see has 

00:00:50.570 --> 00:00:55.370
 a very anatomical shape that mates 

00:00:52.070 --> 00:00:57.200

00:01:00.530 --> 00:01:04.699
 The strap is completely smooth and has a 

00:01:03.079 --> 00:01:07.400
 groove through the center and ends with the 

00:01:04.699 --> 00:01:11.770

00:01:07.400 --> 00:01:11.770
 silicone and it's very flexible 

00:01:12.010 --> 00:01:16.060

00:01:14.080 --> 00:01:17.680

00:01:37.620 --> 00:01:43.260
 and it is not too big either 

00:01:39.920 --> 00:01:45.270
