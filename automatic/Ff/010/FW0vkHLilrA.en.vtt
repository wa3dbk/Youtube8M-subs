 dragon ball z beats z for xbox 360 

00:00:10.099 --> 00:00:14.880
 since some days namco bandai has rendered 

00:00:13.230 --> 00:00:16.830
 available in the online stores of 

00:00:14.880 --> 00:00:18.029

 xbox 360 

00:00:18.029 --> 00:00:22.619
 the long awaited demo version of the new one 

00:00:20.430 --> 00:00:24.240
 chapter of the famous dragon series 

00:00:22.619 --> 00:00:27.240
 ball that will debut on 

00:00:24.240 --> 00:00:30.240
 next January 24 dragon ball za 

00:00:27.240 --> 00:00:32.579
 times the z developed by the art link team 

00:00:30.240 --> 00:00:34.980
 in fact introduces the great novelty of the 

00:00:32.579 --> 00:00:36.570
 multiplayer online characterized by a 

00:00:34.980 --> 00:00:39.690
 four-player cooperative mode 

00:00:36.570 --> 00:00:41.370
 and a competitive 8 player which 

00:00:39.690 --> 00:00:43.649
 they are divided into two teams 

00:00:41.370 --> 00:00:45.690
 but let's proceed with order and let's see 

00:00:43.649 --> 00:00:48.210
 analyze in detail the version of 

00:00:45.690 --> 00:00:50.550
 try for xbox 360 of the already popular 

00:00:48.210 --> 00:00:52.680
 title despite the new episode 

00:00:50.550 --> 00:00:54.899
 of the famous series is based on the manga 

00:00:52.680 --> 00:00:56.820
 of akira toriyama wants to focus 

00:00:54.899 --> 00:00:57.690
 more attention to the sector 

00:00:56.820 --> 00:01:00.239
 multiplayer 

00:00:57.690 --> 00:01:02.070
 the dragon ball z times the z not demo 

00:01:00.239 --> 00:01:04.199
 he could certainly not include her own 

00:01:02.070 --> 00:01:05.519
 internal also the much loved mode 

00:01:04.199 --> 00:01:07.320
 single player 

00:01:05.519 --> 00:01:08.880
 the trial version actually offers us 

00:01:07.320 --> 00:01:10.890
 the chance to play the first ones 

00:01:08.880 --> 00:01:12.869
 four missions of history that there 

00:01:10.890 --> 00:01:14.880
 allow to take confidence either 

00:01:12.869 --> 00:01:18.240
 with the new control system either 

00:01:14.880 --> 00:01:20.009
 with the innovations introduced in the title 

00:01:18.240 --> 00:01:21.810
 each mission begins with a very short one 

00:01:20.009 --> 00:01:23.369
 cutscene that we entered that is 

00:01:21.810 --> 00:01:25.170
 the coming battle does not 

00:01:23.369 --> 00:01:27.060
 particularly complex also due 

00:01:25.170 --> 00:01:30.170
 of poor artificial intelligence 

00:01:27.060 --> 00:01:32.670
 of the enemies we face 

00:01:30.170 --> 00:01:34.409
 after a few minutes of play you enter 

00:01:32.670 --> 00:01:36.210
 immediately familiar with the system of 

00:01:34.409 --> 00:01:38.159
 control that results immediately 

00:01:36.210 --> 00:01:40.350
 quite simple and immediate 

00:01:38.159 --> 00:01:42.689
 however continuing in the missions 

00:01:40.350 --> 00:01:44.399
 we immediately realize that to be able to 

00:01:42.689 --> 00:01:47.759
 day at best we would need 

00:01:44.399 --> 00:01:49.770
 a few hours of playing the simple 

00:01:47.759 --> 00:01:51.299
 pressure of the right bomber gives us the 

00:01:49.770 --> 00:01:53.670
 ability to engage enemies 

00:01:51.299 --> 00:01:56.159
 making our attacks definitely 

00:01:53.670 --> 00:01:57.570
 precise and effective while the bumper 

00:01:56.159 --> 00:02:00.350
 left allows us to talk 

00:01:57.570 --> 00:02:03.149
 any enemy attack 

00:02:00.350 --> 00:02:05.670
 each character besides being able to fly is 

00:02:03.149 --> 00:02:07.590
 equipped with a melee attack one shot 

00:02:05.670 --> 00:02:10.619
 aura your own one 

00:02:07.590 --> 00:02:12.310
 can be activated via a back trigger 

00:02:10.619 --> 00:02:14.110
 filled up completely 

00:02:12.310 --> 00:02:16.540
 the indicator of spiritual energy 

00:02:14.110 --> 00:02:18.220
 by pressing the y and b keys 

00:02:16.540 --> 00:02:19.870
 we will have the possibility to perform a 

00:02:18.220 --> 00:02:22.390
 different special attack for each 

00:02:19.870 --> 00:02:24.430
 kind of cocquio character will be able to 

00:02:22.390 --> 00:02:26.920
 in fact count on the super came to me a 

00:02:24.430 --> 00:02:29.950
 crickets insults small size on the 

00:02:26.920 --> 00:02:31.840
 cannon soul and skirt on the table 

00:02:29.950 --> 00:02:33.580
 last two demo missions in addition to 

00:02:31.840 --> 00:02:35.950
 illustrate fighting and techniques 

00:02:33.580 --> 00:02:38.050
 volunteers in the team also show us 

00:02:35.950 --> 00:02:40.000
 the system of genchi the energy that is 

00:02:38.050 --> 00:02:44.260
 can share at the end of each 

00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:46.000
 clash at the end of each battle 

00:02:44.260 --> 00:02:47.860
 in addition to getting the classic points 

00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:49.930
 experience that allow you to pick up 

00:02:47.860 --> 00:02:52.180
 level all team members 

00:02:49.930 --> 00:02:54.610
 we also unlock special cards 

00:02:52.180 --> 00:02:56.049
 with special features e 

00:02:54.610 --> 00:02:59.230
 that can be assigned to the various 

00:02:56.049 --> 00:03:01.030
 characters in order to customize the 

00:02:59.230 --> 00:03:03.220
 warrior modification is not limited 

00:03:01.030 --> 00:03:05.440
 only to the allocation of the various cards 

00:03:03.220 --> 00:03:06.849
 obtained at the end of each fight but the 

00:03:05.440 --> 00:03:09.099
 title will give us the opportunity to 

00:03:06.849 --> 00:03:11.650
 also change the appearance of ours 

00:03:09.099 --> 00:03:13.930
 character as stated multiple times 

00:03:11.650 --> 00:03:16.000
 also from the same they also have bandai 

00:03:13.930 --> 00:03:17.829
 the real novelty of the title is the 

00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:20.320
 online sector and its battles a 

00:03:17.829 --> 00:03:24.310
 teams that actually bring innovation 

00:03:20.320 --> 00:03:26.410
 to the famous series the demo version ci 

00:03:24.310 --> 00:03:28.030
 offers the opportunity to test both the 

00:03:26.410 --> 00:03:30.130
 cooperative mode than that 

00:03:28.030 --> 00:03:32.650
 competitive characterized by 8 

00:03:30.130 --> 00:03:34.239
 players divided into two teams 

00:03:32.650 --> 00:03:36.280
 the cooperative in which they can 

00:03:34.239 --> 00:03:38.260
 take parts up to a maximum of 

00:03:36.280 --> 00:03:40.060
 four players allows us instead of 

00:03:38.260 --> 00:03:42.489
 face all single missions 

00:03:40.060 --> 00:03:44.530
 player together with our friends making 

00:03:42.489 --> 00:03:47.049
 in this way the various clashes much more 

00:03:44.530 --> 00:03:48.609
 tactics and fun the most mode 

00:03:47.049 --> 00:03:51.220
 expected by all fans of the saga is 

00:03:48.609 --> 00:03:53.260
 however the competitive mode in which 

00:03:51.220 --> 00:03:56.019
 as anticipated before they can clash 

00:03:53.260 --> 00:03:58.540
 up to 8 players that are divided 

00:03:56.019 --> 00:04:02.459
 in two teams we are brought accordingly 

00:03:58.540 --> 00:04:02.459
 to face 4-on-4 confrontations 

00:04:02.470 --> 00:04:06.220
 obviously it is useless to underline that the 

00:04:04.780 --> 00:04:08.500
 teamwork is essential 

00:04:06.220 --> 00:04:10.690
 to take the victory home 

00:04:08.500 --> 00:04:12.310
 being able to combine and synchronize 

00:04:10.690 --> 00:04:14.799
 attacks with other team members 

00:04:12.310 --> 00:04:18.120
 it was certainly a walk and requires 

00:04:14.799 --> 00:04:20.620
 harmony and collaboration 

00:04:18.120 --> 00:04:22.449
 unfortunately some aspects of the sector 

00:04:20.620 --> 00:04:24.160
 multiplayer have revealed some 

00:04:22.449 --> 00:04:25.930
 small problem leaving us in 

00:04:24.160 --> 00:04:26.350
 certain situations with the bitter in 

00:04:25.930 --> 00:04:28.900
 mouth 

00:04:26.350 --> 00:04:30.580
 the matchmaking system is not 

00:04:28.900 --> 00:04:32.290
 currently up to what the 

00:04:30.580 --> 00:04:34.210
 site does not want to offer in time 

00:04:32.290 --> 00:04:36.100
 occasions we found ourselves waiting 

00:04:34.210 --> 00:04:36.639
 endless minutes in the pre room 

00:04:36.100 --> 00:04:39.729
 game 

00:04:36.639 --> 00:04:41.770
 the next game crash also the 

00:04:39.729 --> 00:04:43.449
 presence of lag during clashes e 

00:04:41.770 --> 00:04:47.020
 he often made ours 

00:04:43.449 --> 00:04:49.539
 games decidedly unplayable in 

00:04:47.020 --> 00:04:51.150
 conclusion dragon ball z beats the z 

00:04:49.539 --> 00:04:53.710
 turns out to be a decidedly title 

00:04:51.150 --> 00:04:55.630
 promising even if it still needs to 

00:04:53.710 --> 00:04:57.880
 some improvements especially from the point 

00:04:55.630 --> 00:04:59.949
 view of the competitive online sector 

00:04:57.880 --> 00:05:02.050
 the first missions of the single campaign 

00:04:59.949 --> 00:05:04.750
 players can be well structured 

00:05:02.050 --> 00:05:07.060
 however in some cases they turn out to be 

00:05:04.750 --> 00:05:09.789
 decidedly hasty and limited to 

00:05:07.060 --> 00:05:12.190
 battles against enemies too easy 

00:05:09.789 --> 00:05:14.229
 to defeat the competitive mode 

00:05:12.190 --> 00:05:16.419
 proposes in exciting battles and 

00:05:14.229 --> 00:05:18.460
 fun that will surely increase 

00:05:16.419 --> 00:05:20.470
 much of the longevity of the title 

00:05:18.460 --> 00:05:22.030
 however the problems present in the 

00:05:20.470 --> 00:05:24.250
 multiplayer compartment must 

00:05:22.030 --> 00:05:26.169
 absolutely be solved before 

00:05:24.250 --> 00:05:28.479
 official release of the game that will take place 

00:05:26.169 --> 00:05:30.340
 January 24th for this short video 

00:05:28.479 --> 00:05:32.440
 preview and all thanks for being 

00:05:30.340 --> 00:05:36.780
