00:01:51.359 --> 00:01:51.369 
and did you notice a huge difference

00:01:51.369 --> 00:01:53.669 
and did you notice a huge difference
like<00:01:51.939> the<00:01:52.090> first<00:01:52.270> time<00:01:52.390> you<00:01:52.479> got<00:01:52.600> on<00:01:52.630> it<00:01:52.869> to<00:01:53.590> be

00:01:53.669 --> 00:01:53.679 
like the first time you got on it to be

00:01:53.679 --> 00:01:55.410 
like the first time you got on it to be
honest<00:01:53.859> with<00:01:53.920> you<00:01:54.100> can't<00:01:54.549> tell<00:01:54.759> you<00:01:55.119> get<00:01:55.270> in

00:01:55.410 --> 00:01:55.420 
honest with you can't tell you get in

00:01:55.420 --> 00:01:57.300 
honest with you can't tell you get in
the<00:01:55.509> sled<00:01:55.689> you<00:01:56.140> drive<00:01:56.380> it<00:01:56.530> down<00:01:56.649> just<00:01:56.829> like<00:01:56.950> my

00:01:57.300 --> 00:01:57.310 
the sled you drive it down just like my

00:01:57.310 --> 00:01:59.429 
the sled you drive it down just like my
old<00:01:57.520> sled<00:01:57.759> it<00:01:58.179> feels<00:01:58.390> the<00:01:58.539> same<00:01:58.719> but<00:01:59.259> then<00:01:59.380> you

00:01:59.429 --> 00:01:59.439 
old sled it feels the same but then you

00:01:59.439 --> 00:02:00.419 
old sled it feels the same but then you
get<00:01:59.530> to<00:01:59.590> the<00:01:59.710> bottom<00:01:59.829> you<00:01:59.950> look<00:02:00.100> at<00:02:00.189> the<00:02:00.249> clock

00:02:00.419 --> 00:02:00.429 
get to the bottom you look at the clock

00:02:00.429 --> 00:02:04.200 
get to the bottom you look at the clock
you<00:02:00.579> like<00:02:00.670> it's<00:02:01.329> fast<00:02:02.640> there's<00:02:03.640> no<00:02:03.789> difference

00:02:04.200 --> 00:02:04.210 
you like it's fast there's no difference

00:02:04.210 --> 00:02:06.059 
you like it's fast there's no difference
in<00:02:04.329> feeling<00:02:04.719> right<00:02:04.929> you<00:02:05.049> just<00:02:05.170> you<00:02:05.590> can't<00:02:05.799> tell

00:02:06.059 --> 00:02:06.069 
in feeling right you just you can't tell

00:02:06.069 --> 00:02:07.709 
in feeling right you just you can't tell
that<00:02:06.100> you're<00:02:06.399> going<00:02:06.640> fast<00:02:06.819> so<00:02:06.939> you<00:02:07.090> just<00:02:07.240> got

00:02:07.709 --> 00:02:07.719 
that you're going fast so you just got

00:02:07.719 --> 00:02:09.169 
that you're going fast so you just got
the<00:02:07.840> clock<00:02:08.050> it's<00:02:08.229> it's<00:02:08.410> not<00:02:08.500> like<00:02:08.560> cheating

00:02:09.169 --> 00:02:09.179 
the clock it's it's not like cheating

00:02:09.179 --> 00:02:10.680 
the clock it's it's not like cheating
yeah<00:02:10.179> exactly

00:02:10.680 --> 00:02:10.690 
yeah exactly

00:02:10.690 --> 00:02:12.300 
yeah exactly

00:02:47.179 --> 00:02:47.189 
you in not from the very top they let

00:02:47.189 --> 00:02:49.099 
you in not from the very top they let

00:02:49.099 --> 00:02:49.109 
you start like halfway down the track so

00:02:49.109 --> 00:02:51.349 
you start like halfway down the track so
you<00:02:49.169> it<00:02:49.530> wasn't<00:02:49.829> that<00:02:50.159> fast<00:02:50.489> it<00:02:50.970> was<00:02:51.060> actually

00:02:51.349 --> 00:02:51.359 
you it wasn't that fast it was actually

00:02:51.359 --> 00:02:52.759 
you it wasn't that fast it was actually
like<00:02:51.599> I<00:02:51.689> was<00:02:51.780> nervous<00:02:52.139> because<00:02:52.290> I<00:02:52.439> didn't<00:02:52.709> know

00:02:52.759 --> 00:02:52.769 
like I was nervous because I didn't know

00:02:52.769 --> 00:02:54.470 
like I was nervous because I didn't know
what<00:02:52.919> to<00:02:53.010> expect<00:02:53.310> but<00:02:53.730> once<00:02:53.939> I<00:02:54.030> started<00:02:54.329> going

00:02:54.470 --> 00:02:54.480 
what to expect but once I started going

00:02:54.480 --> 00:02:55.879 
what to expect but once I started going
and<00:02:54.870> I<00:02:55.079> thought<00:02:55.230> we<00:02:55.349> weren't<00:02:55.470> going<00:02:55.620> that<00:02:55.769> fast

00:02:55.879 --> 00:02:55.889 
and I thought we weren't going that fast

00:02:55.889 --> 00:02:57.349 
and I thought we weren't going that fast
it's<00:02:56.220> sort<00:02:56.340> of<00:02:56.400> like<00:02:56.549> being<00:02:56.819> on<00:02:56.939> the<00:02:57.120> best

00:02:57.349 --> 00:02:57.359 
it's sort of like being on the best

00:02:57.359 --> 00:02:59.000 
it's sort of like being on the best
go-kart<00:02:57.870> ride<00:02:58.049> I'd<00:02:58.200> ever<00:02:58.349> be<00:02:58.500> on<00:02:58.739> it<00:02:58.889> was

go-kart ride I'd ever be on it was

00:02:59.010 --> 00:03:00.860 
go-kart ride I'd ever be on it was
really<00:02:59.040> fun<00:02:59.669> I<00:02:59.879> got<00:03:00.120> to<00:03:00.239> a<00:03:00.269> bottom<00:03:00.599> when<00:03:00.689> I<00:03:00.750> was

00:03:00.860 --> 00:03:00.870 
really fun I got to a bottom when I was

00:03:00.870 --> 00:03:02.449 
really fun I got to a bottom when I was
excited<00:03:01.139> I<00:03:01.379> wanted<00:03:01.650> to<00:03:01.739> go<00:03:01.859> right<00:03:02.069> to<00:03:02.219> the<00:03:02.250> back

00:03:02.449 --> 00:03:02.459 
excited I wanted to go right to the back

00:03:02.459 --> 00:03:05.569 
excited I wanted to go right to the back
up<00:03:02.700> and<00:03:02.879> do<00:03:03.030> it<00:03:03.060> again<00:03:03.359> it<00:03:04.049> was<00:03:04.469> really<00:03:04.680> fun<00:03:04.980> but

00:03:05.569 --> 00:03:05.579 
up and do it again it was really fun but

00:03:05.579 --> 00:03:07.190 
up and do it again it was really fun but
then<00:03:05.730> when<00:03:05.909> they<00:03:06.030> did<00:03:06.090> take<00:03:06.359> me<00:03:06.540> to<00:03:06.659> the<00:03:06.750> top<00:03:06.900> I

00:03:07.190 --> 00:03:07.200 
then when they did take me to the top I

00:03:07.200 --> 00:03:10.009

00:03:16.819 --> 00:03:16.829 
you're learning to drive you got to

00:03:16.829 --> 00:03:20.659 
you're learning to drive you got to
learn<00:03:16.979> to<00:03:17.220> really<00:03:17.959> fight<00:03:18.959> against<00:03:19.829> your<00:03:20.099> like

usually<00:03:21.209> when<00:03:21.239> you<00:03:21.540> crash<00:03:21.750> it's<00:03:21.959> because<00:03:22.199> you

00:03:22.369 --> 00:03:22.379 
usually when you crash it's because you

00:03:22.379 --> 00:03:24.379 
usually when you crash it's because you
did<00:03:22.530> something<00:03:22.829> if<00:03:23.760> you<00:03:23.879> would've<00:03:24.060> just<00:03:24.090> let

00:03:24.379 --> 00:03:24.389 
did something if you would've just let

the<00:03:24.510> sled<00:03:24.750> go<00:03:24.930> it<00:03:25.260> probably<00:03:25.709> might<00:03:25.889> not<00:03:25.919> have

00:03:26.180 --> 00:03:26.190 
the sled go it probably might not have

00:03:26.190 --> 00:03:27.559 
the sled go it probably might not have
been<00:03:26.280> a<00:03:26.340> really<00:03:26.699> nice<00:03:26.819> line<00:03:27.060> but<00:03:27.239> it<00:03:27.329> wasn't<00:03:27.540> a

00:03:27.559 --> 00:03:27.569 
been a really nice line but it wasn't a

00:03:27.569 --> 00:03:29.750 
been a really nice line but it wasn't a
dump<00:03:27.810> but<00:03:28.470> you<00:03:28.620> do<00:03:28.769> too<00:03:28.949> much<00:03:29.099> you<00:03:29.159> overreact

00:03:29.750 --> 00:03:29.760 
dump but you do too much you overreact

00:03:29.760 --> 00:03:31.309 
dump but you do too much you overreact
because<00:03:29.849> your<00:03:30.090> anxiety<00:03:30.599> your<00:03:30.629> fear<00:03:30.989> you<00:03:31.229> know

pull you steer too hard and then you

00:03:34.949 --> 00:03:36.349
