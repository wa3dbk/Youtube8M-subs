00:00:14.269 --> 00:00:19.890
 today I want to touch on the topic of organization 

00:00:17.310 --> 00:00:22.650
 storage cosmetics as I have everything 

00:00:19.890 --> 00:00:25.260
 used and necessary means 

00:00:22.650 --> 00:00:27.470
 I have been in different places for a long time 

00:00:25.260 --> 00:00:30.779
 dreamed of a full-fledged dressing table 

00:00:27.470 --> 00:00:32.550
 so that all that was needed at hand for a long time 

00:00:30.779 --> 00:00:35.430
 I was looking for a table that I liked 

00:00:32.550 --> 00:00:37.649
 and in the end I found where the delivery in 

00:00:35.430 --> 00:00:40.410
 Russia is impossible but to help me 

00:00:37.649 --> 00:00:42.329
 mediators came and I waited for my table 

00:00:40.410 --> 00:00:45.180
 somewhere around 3 months 

00:00:42.329 --> 00:00:47.280
 unfortunately in my city I am what 

00:00:45.180 --> 00:00:49.950
 searched could not find therefore me 

00:00:47.280 --> 00:00:51.809
 I had to go the hard way and the main 

00:00:49.950 --> 00:00:53.879
 the problem was just waiting 

00:00:51.809 --> 00:00:57.030
 I suggest you start with me 

00:00:53.879 --> 00:00:59.760
 organization is my main goal so that everyone 

00:00:57.030 --> 00:01:01.920
 what was used at hand without extra 

00:00:59.760 --> 00:01:04.710
 movements moving along the next 

00:01:01.920 --> 00:01:07.590
 direction from left to right here is the beginning 

00:01:04.710 --> 00:01:09.500
 make-up to completion i.e. step by step 

00:01:07.590 --> 00:01:12.360
 for convenience, I decided to purchase 

00:01:09.500 --> 00:01:14.960
 I have two drawer dividers 

00:01:12.360 --> 00:01:14.960
 options 

00:01:22.050 --> 00:01:25.900
 those with adjustable containers 

00:01:25.300 --> 00:01:30.300
 diameter 

00:01:25.900 --> 00:01:30.300
 They are suitable for my average box 

00:01:39.540 --> 00:01:46.530
 The second option on the principle of collect yourself 

00:01:42.100 --> 00:01:46.530
 can be adjusted as convenient 

00:01:48.820 --> 00:01:54.079
 let's start like this 

00:01:51.470 --> 00:01:56.180
 cosmetics organization yes i want 

00:01:54.079 --> 00:01:58.700
 place it now in the middle box 

00:01:56.180 --> 00:02:01.369
 toilet became'll use 

00:01:58.700 --> 00:02:04.100
 Ready containers in a set 4 pieces 

00:02:01.369 --> 00:02:06.710
 the length of the cabinets does not allow to place them 

00:02:04.100 --> 00:02:09.429
 vertical so I get on horizontally 

00:02:06.710 --> 00:02:09.429
 so maybe better 

00:02:16.810 --> 00:02:24.010
 and there is a gap that I fill 

00:02:20.099 --> 00:02:26.920
 measure by separator constructor 

00:02:24.010 --> 00:02:31.750
 right size and break off necessary 

00:02:26.920 --> 00:02:34.209
 part of the designer by the way was enough 

00:02:31.750 --> 00:02:36.310
 on one such box and partition to 

00:02:34.209 --> 00:02:39.300
 starting from the second cell 

00:02:36.310 --> 00:02:45.640
 distribute makeup cosmetics 

00:02:39.300 --> 00:02:51.489
 primers putin divide further based 

00:02:45.640 --> 00:02:53.920
 summer the next branch is putting veils and 

00:02:51.489 --> 00:03:00.459
 frequently used bronzer 

00:02:53.920 --> 00:03:02.650
 and blush in the third cell I will 

00:03:00.459 --> 00:03:03.630
 conveniently arrange makeup 

00:03:02.650 --> 00:03:06.630
 eye 

00:03:03.630 --> 00:03:08.410
 single palette of glitter shadows 

00:03:06.630 --> 00:03:10.330
 glitter shadows 

00:03:08.410 --> 00:03:13.360
 mineral shadows in full size 

00:03:10.330 --> 00:03:15.160
 the highlighter variant is difficult to understand at first 

00:03:13.360 --> 00:03:15.819
 what place will be convenient 

00:03:15.160 --> 00:03:18.280
 use 

00:03:15.819 --> 00:03:21.000
 but in the process all this is decided not 

00:03:18.280 --> 00:03:23.769
 be afraid to experiment 

00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:24.760
 here right under the palette I will move 

00:03:23.769 --> 00:03:27.280
 sparkles 

00:03:24.760 --> 00:03:31.420
 they are rarely used eyeliner here 

00:03:27.280 --> 00:03:34.060
 will be by the way and eye primer in extreme 

00:03:31.420 --> 00:03:36.630
 parts nail file call roll for eyelashes and 

00:03:34.060 --> 00:03:36.630

 liner antimony and antimony powder and also 

00:03:56.720 --> 00:04:02.150
 often used every day and 

00:03:59.709 --> 00:04:07.909
 next to self-made division put 

00:04:02.150 --> 00:04:09.890
 carcass miniatures separate small part 

00:04:07.909 --> 00:04:17.540
 to put a pencil and leaves for 

00:04:09.890 --> 00:04:21.799
 eyes oh no do not go try 

00:04:17.540 --> 00:04:23.750
 fit them cut so better move on to 

00:04:21.799 --> 00:04:26.449
 I will have the first branch here 

00:04:23.750 --> 00:04:30.740
 lipstick first miniatures gloss and lipstick 

00:04:26.449 --> 00:04:32.930
 separate them follow lipstick full size 

00:04:30.740 --> 00:04:35.539
 they lay sideways thanks to this their 

00:04:32.930 --> 00:04:37.699
 convenient to get laid absolutely 

00:04:35.539 --> 00:04:39.350
 randomly class I still have a place 

00:04:37.699 --> 00:04:46.610
 for lip balms 

00:04:39.350 --> 00:04:49.580
 and here is another lip tar left in his top 

00:04:46.610 --> 00:04:52.120
 plug separate short distance for 

00:04:49.580 --> 00:04:56.900
 brilliance to put them tilted 

00:04:52.120 --> 00:04:59.419
 perfectly closes without interference and I 

00:04:56.900 --> 00:05:02.389
 left free cells do not know yet 

00:04:59.419 --> 00:05:06.070
 let me adjust this 

00:05:02.389 --> 00:05:06.070
 the final result of my organization 

00:05:17.380 --> 00:05:23.240
 left to put cotton pads for them 

00:05:20.450 --> 00:05:25.490
 I chose a transparent container it is more 

00:05:23.240 --> 00:05:29.690
 for cotton swabs but I have 

00:05:25.490 --> 00:05:32.870
 for them will be a ceramic swan all 

00:05:29.690 --> 00:05:35.680
 main brushes placed laconic tube 

00:05:32.870 --> 00:05:38.660
 will stand at my right hand 

00:05:35.680 --> 00:05:41.450
 all your samplers shade and put in 

00:05:38.660 --> 00:05:45.670
 box distributed over the scale and I think 

00:05:41.450 --> 00:05:45.670
 that they will look nice on the table 

00:05:49.090 --> 00:05:53.120
 so far only organized cosmetics and 

00:05:52.160 --> 00:05:55.220
 left drawer

 there I have tablets and books that 

00:05:55.220 --> 00:05:57.970
 I'm reading now 

00:06:01.940 --> 00:06:07.430
 and I also consider it a big plus 

00:06:04.460 --> 00:06:10.490
 The table is quite high mirrors can be 

00:06:07.430 --> 00:06:11.480
 see the image before going out of course 

00:06:10.490 --> 00:06:15.100
 not full length 

00:06:11.480 --> 00:06:15.100
 but still a nice bonus 

00:06:18.760 --> 00:06:23.890
 thank you for keeping company in 

00:06:21.500 --> 00:06:26.900
