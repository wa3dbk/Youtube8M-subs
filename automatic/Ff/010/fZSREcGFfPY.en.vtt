00:00:03.929 --> 00:00:11.040

00:00:08.160 --> 00:00:15.269
 there was a personal knockout is what gives 

00:00:11.040 --> 00:00:21.689
 out in floral and funny that 

00:00:15.269 --> 00:00:24.420
 it was a lot of sunshine it's from Wednesday 

00:00:21.689 --> 00:00:29.609
 is I was think it was a light 3-1 in 

00:00:24.420 --> 00:00:31.740
 twitter watch today I will do it again and I will 

00:00:29.609 --> 00:00:33.149
 I was playing at 3 hours and in the end 

00:00:31.740 --> 00:00:35.309
 The time that I was going to close there is to see the 

00:00:33.149 --> 00:00:38.160
 enrolled who was watching 

00:00:35.309 --> 00:00:41.190
 by the nuclear industry is lower than 

00:00:38.160 --> 00:00:43.200
 I went to try and I got into this game. 

00:00:41.190 --> 00:00:45.870
 but it was already in progress 

00:00:43.200 --> 00:00:48.739
 catch there I ended up closing the hymn 

00:00:45.870 --> 00:00:55.649
 I just closed the live and I went 

00:00:48.739 --> 00:00:57.660
 do something and let the 

00:00:55.649 --> 00:01:00.149
 open game, right? 

00:00:57.660 --> 00:01:02.430
 By the time I got back I was in the party. 

00:01:00.149 --> 00:01:04.439
 decision should come out in the beginning they saw 

00:01:02.430 --> 00:01:08.040
 who had already started to swear had 

00:01:04.439 --> 00:01:09.450
 given a 30- second start and I do not 

00:01:08.040 --> 00:01:13.799
 I had the choice of almost almost the 

00:01:09.450 --> 00:01:15.210
 certificate and I did not close the game and 

00:01:13.799 --> 00:01:18.060
 I ended up playing the last match and 

00:01:15.210 --> 00:01:20.960
 I got nuclear and nuclear 

00:01:18.060 --> 00:01:24.540
 floral and the funniest thing was that I 

00:01:20.960 --> 00:01:26.220
 neither do I have in my account for whom 

00:01:24.540 --> 00:01:34.470
 I do not know, everything happened a friend 

00:01:26.220 --> 00:01:37.200
 nuclear sense to him or in my 

00:01:34.470 --> 00:01:38.970
 I got it and I got it , I did not 

00:01:37.200 --> 00:01:46.079
 I want to continue to account for him, do not you? 

00:01:38.970 --> 00:01:50.340
 It's interesting because you're going to see 6 

00:01:46.079 --> 00:01:52.590
 that the drive is if you want 

00:01:50.340 --> 00:01:56.549
 try one I recommend this drive 

00:01:52.590 --> 00:01:59.250
 is doing is inside the house come down 

00:01:56.549 --> 00:02:03.030
 there on the right on the road and 

00:01:59.250 --> 00:02:05.610
 taking the kill that will prevent is 

00:02:03.030 --> 00:02:07.890
 because down there will always give two 

00:02:05.610 --> 00:02:09.840
 respond and one of the two will end 

00:02:07.890 --> 00:02:12.180
 wanting to kill yourself and it's going to be for you 

00:02:09.840 --> 00:02:12.960
 You 'll end up killing more. 

00:02:12.180 --> 00:02:15.300
 facility 

00:02:12.960 --> 00:02:17.190
 This morning and now I'm going to do it and I'll talk 

00:02:15.300 --> 00:02:21.540
 class you were using right? 

00:02:17.190 --> 00:02:23.520
 I was there with mmc sites in flash and meg 

00:02:21.540 --> 00:02:26.520
 a very good combination for 

00:02:23.520 --> 00:02:31.140
 try to get what you give the team for badly 

00:02:26.520 --> 00:02:33.690
 and it's on the pedal that it's going to be where it's very 

00:02:31.140 --> 00:02:37.080
 good to pick up the audio foot and the 

00:02:33.690 --> 00:02:39.990
 Tip for you who want to get a boot and 

00:02:37.080 --> 00:02:45.090
 muffler because 

00:02:39.990 --> 00:02:47.160
 It's professional, you're against everyone. 

00:02:45.090 --> 00:02:49.350
 if you have no silencer I think 

00:02:47.160 --> 00:02:51.900
 it will be kind of difficult because the enemy 

00:02:49.350 --> 00:02:54.870
 will end up watching you for the radar 

00:02:51.900 --> 00:02:55.890
 will end up dancing something behind the back 

00:02:54.870 --> 00:02:57.930
 type 

00:02:55.890 --> 00:03:01.590
 and there I was relentless honor to 

00:02:57.930 --> 00:03:03.510
 shit I did was not now have 

00:03:01.590 --> 00:03:04.590
 dead was a shit I jumped had 

00:03:03.510 --> 00:03:06.570
 a guy underneath 

00:03:04.590 --> 00:03:09.720
 I almost almost died in the 

00:03:06.570 --> 00:03:12.330
 hospital, continue to talk to the 

00:03:09.720 --> 00:03:17.220
 and is using in the parks airlines 

00:03:12.330 --> 00:03:19.470
 people fan two bids that told me that 

00:03:17.220 --> 00:03:30.410
 three as it should always be of not 

00:03:19.470 --> 00:03:42.620
 play without you here and you already have a quick 

00:03:30.410 --> 00:03:42.620
 That's going to play now, as I've always done here. 

00:03:52.850 --> 00:04:05.340
 I do not think you use muffler 

00:04:02.820 --> 00:04:07.890
 It's a good help. 

00:04:05.340 --> 00:04:11.300
 if you do not use the goals also in the help 

00:04:07.890 --> 00:04:11.300
 damn against the hiv 

00:04:12.420 --> 00:04:23.730
 I do not use much because you end up seeing that 

00:04:16.220 --> 00:04:26.639
 the staff finishes loading either be exits 

00:04:23.730 --> 00:04:28.620
 I do not know why 

00:04:26.639 --> 00:04:33.180
 I think it's worse than you, right? 

00:04:28.620 --> 00:04:36.210
 charge and network kit eva because it is 

00:04:33.180 --> 00:04:38.310
