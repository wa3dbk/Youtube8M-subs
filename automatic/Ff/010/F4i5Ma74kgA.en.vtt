hi<00:00:03.500> today's<00:00:03.980> 2<00:00:04.160> minute<00:00:04.190> baseless<00:00:04.730> we're<00:00:04.970> going

00:00:05.080 --> 00:00:05.090 
hi today's 2 minute baseless we're going

00:00:05.090 --> 00:00:08.230 
hi today's 2 minute baseless we're going
to<00:00:05.149> cover<00:00:05.359> practicing<00:00:06.170> scales<00:00:06.410> part<00:00:06.859> three<00:00:07.240> in

00:00:08.230 --> 00:00:08.240 
to cover practicing scales part three in

00:00:08.240 --> 00:00:10.690 
to cover practicing scales part three in
the<00:00:08.540> previous<00:00:09.280> exercises<00:00:10.280> that<00:00:10.400> give<00:00:10.580> you

00:00:10.690 --> 00:00:10.700 
the previous exercises that give you

00:00:10.700 --> 00:00:12.970 
the previous exercises that give you
part<00:00:10.910> 1<00:00:11.030> and<00:00:11.059> part<00:00:11.179> 2<00:00:11.300> we<00:00:11.809> worked<00:00:12.559> within<00:00:12.800> the

00:00:12.970 --> 00:00:12.980 
part 1 and part 2 we worked within the

00:00:12.980 --> 00:00:15.610 
part 1 and part 2 we worked within the
one<00:00:13.280> octave<00:00:13.700> pattern<00:00:14.120> we<00:00:14.660> played<00:00:14.900> a<00:00:15.139> scale

00:00:15.610 --> 00:00:15.620 
one octave pattern we played a scale

00:00:15.620 --> 00:00:18.580 
one octave pattern we played a scale
from<00:00:15.799> the<00:00:15.980> root<00:00:16.189> up<00:00:16.490> to<00:00:16.790> the<00:00:16.910> octave<00:00:17.270> and<00:00:17.590> we

00:00:18.580 --> 00:00:18.590 
from the root up to the octave and we

00:00:18.590 --> 00:00:20.200 
from the root up to the octave and we
did<00:00:18.770> things<00:00:18.950> with<00:00:19.250> it<00:00:19.310> within<00:00:19.640> that<00:00:19.939> framework

00:00:20.200 --> 00:00:20.210 
did things with it within that framework

00:00:20.210 --> 00:00:21.940 
did things with it within that framework
what<00:00:20.540> I<00:00:20.570> want<00:00:20.750> to<00:00:20.840> encourage<00:00:21.230> you<00:00:21.529> to<00:00:21.680> do<00:00:21.739> now

00:00:21.940 --> 00:00:21.950 
what I want to encourage you to do now

00:00:21.950 --> 00:00:25.179 
what I want to encourage you to do now
is<00:00:22.189> go<00:00:22.820> to<00:00:22.880> two<00:00:23.180> octaves<00:00:23.720> which<00:00:24.349> is<00:00:24.590> if<00:00:24.950> I'm

00:00:25.179 --> 00:00:25.189 
is go to two octaves which is if I'm

00:00:25.189 --> 00:00:27.100 
is go to two octaves which is if I'm
playing<00:00:25.340> this<00:00:25.640> scene<00:00:25.910> you're<00:00:26.750> going<00:00:26.930> to<00:00:26.989> work

00:00:27.100 --> 00:00:27.110 
playing this scene you're going to work

00:00:27.110 --> 00:00:31.120 
playing this scene you're going to work
all<00:00:27.320> the<00:00:27.500> way<00:00:27.529> up<00:00:27.710> to<00:00:27.739> the<00:00:27.890> sea<00:00:28.210> and<00:00:29.210> I<00:00:30.130> would

00:00:31.120 --> 00:00:31.130 
all the way up to the sea and I would

00:00:31.130 --> 00:00:32.319 
all the way up to the sea and I would
love<00:00:31.250> to<00:00:31.369> be<00:00:31.460> able<00:00:31.520> to<00:00:31.640> give<00:00:31.700> you<00:00:31.820> one<00:00:32.059> pattern

00:00:32.319 --> 00:00:32.329 
love to be able to give you one pattern

00:00:32.329 --> 00:00:34.090 
love to be able to give you one pattern
and<00:00:32.630> say<00:00:32.750> this<00:00:32.930> is<00:00:32.989> it<00:00:33.260> do<00:00:33.440> it<00:00:33.590> but<00:00:33.770> that's<00:00:33.950> not

00:00:34.090 --> 00:00:34.100 
and say this is it do it but that's not

00:00:34.100 --> 00:00:36.010 
and say this is it do it but that's not
that's<00:00:34.489> not<00:00:34.640> true<00:00:34.970> everyone<00:00:35.450> has<00:00:35.810> different

00:00:36.010 --> 00:00:36.020 
that's not true everyone has different

00:00:36.020 --> 00:00:37.650 
that's not true everyone has different
styles<00:00:36.470> of<00:00:36.620> playing<00:00:36.860> they<00:00:37.040> have<00:00:37.160> different

00:00:37.650 --> 00:00:37.660 
styles of playing they have different

00:00:37.660 --> 00:00:40.330 
styles of playing they have different
abilities<00:00:38.660> they<00:00:39.140> have<00:00:39.290> different<00:00:39.530> hand<00:00:40.040> sizes

00:00:40.330 --> 00:00:40.340 
abilities they have different hand sizes

00:00:40.340 --> 00:00:42.460 
abilities they have different hand sizes
so<00:00:40.760> one<00:00:41.390> pattern<00:00:41.630> might<00:00:41.900> not<00:00:42.050> work<00:00:42.260> for

00:00:42.460 --> 00:00:42.470 
so one pattern might not work for

00:00:42.470 --> 00:00:43.960 
so one pattern might not work for
everybody<00:00:42.710> so<00:00:43.280> what<00:00:43.400> I<00:00:43.430> want<00:00:43.580> to<00:00:43.640> give<00:00:43.760> you<00:00:43.790> as

00:00:43.960 --> 00:00:43.970 
everybody so what I want to give you as

00:00:43.970 --> 00:00:46.510 
everybody so what I want to give you as
a<00:00:44.000> theory<00:00:44.540> or<00:00:45.350> some<00:00:45.590> guidelines<00:00:46.010> to<00:00:46.280> create

00:00:46.510 --> 00:00:46.520 
a theory or some guidelines to create

00:00:46.520 --> 00:00:49.510 
a theory or some guidelines to create
your<00:00:46.550> own<00:00:46.850> two<00:00:47.150> octave<00:00:47.570> patterns<00:00:47.930> on<00:00:48.920> the

00:00:49.510 --> 00:00:49.520 
your own two octave patterns on the

00:00:49.520 --> 00:00:51.370 
your own two octave patterns on the
electric<00:00:49.820> bass<00:00:49.970> what<00:00:50.300> I<00:00:50.329> don't<00:00:50.750> like<00:00:51.020> to<00:00:51.170> see

00:00:51.370 --> 00:00:51.380 
electric bass what I don't like to see

00:00:51.380 --> 00:00:53.380 
electric bass what I don't like to see
is<00:00:51.590> people<00:00:52.280> playing<00:00:52.730> the<00:00:52.880> pattern<00:00:53.210> all<00:00:53.360> the

00:00:53.380 --> 00:00:53.390 
is people playing the pattern all the

00:00:53.390 --> 00:00:56.440 
is people playing the pattern all the
way<00:00:53.510> across<00:00:53.690> up<00:00:54.470> to<00:00:54.710> the<00:00:54.800> octave<00:00:55.190> and<00:00:55.430> then<00:00:56.120> use

00:00:56.440 --> 00:00:56.450 
way across up to the octave and then use

00:00:56.450 --> 00:01:00.450 
way across up to the octave and then use
their<00:00:56.660> pinkie<00:00:57.050> up<00:00:58.180> to<00:00:59.180> the<00:00:59.300> second<00:00:59.720> octave

00:01:00.450 --> 00:01:00.460 
their pinkie up to the second octave

00:01:00.460 --> 00:01:03.100 
their pinkie up to the second octave
well<00:01:01.460> technically<00:01:01.970> correct<00:01:02.450> by<00:01:02.810> by

00:01:03.100 --> 00:01:03.110 
well technically correct by by

00:01:03.110 --> 00:01:04.569 
well technically correct by by
practicing<00:01:03.680> that<00:01:03.800> way<00:01:04.009> you're<00:01:04.220> not<00:01:04.250> really

00:01:04.569 --> 00:01:04.579 
practicing that way you're not really

00:01:04.579 --> 00:01:08.020 
practicing that way you're not really
set<00:01:05.299> to<00:01:05.449> play<00:01:05.659> patterns<00:01:06.439> and<00:01:06.650> phrases<00:01:07.310> as

00:01:08.020 --> 00:01:08.030 
set to play patterns and phrases as

00:01:08.030 --> 00:01:10.270 
set to play patterns and phrases as
easily<00:01:08.360> is<00:01:08.750> if<00:01:09.140> you<00:01:09.260> organize<00:01:09.680> your<00:01:09.950> notes<00:01:10.010> a

00:01:10.270 --> 00:01:10.280 
easily is if you organize your notes a

00:01:10.280 --> 00:01:11.680 
easily is if you organize your notes a
little<00:01:10.490> better<00:01:10.640> and<00:01:10.880> how<00:01:11.360> do<00:01:11.420> you<00:01:11.540> do<00:01:11.659> that

00:01:11.680 --> 00:01:11.690 
little better and how do you do that

00:01:11.690 --> 00:01:15.070 
little better and how do you do that
well<00:01:12.350> quite<00:01:12.650> simple<00:01:13.100> I<00:01:13.280> try<00:01:13.790> to<00:01:13.820> play<00:01:14.780> like

00:01:15.070 --> 00:01:15.080 
well quite simple I try to play like

00:01:15.080 --> 00:01:17.440 
well quite simple I try to play like
bursts<00:01:16.010> or<00:01:16.100> groups<00:01:16.430> of<00:01:16.580> four<00:01:16.820> or<00:01:16.850> five<00:01:17.120> notes

00:01:17.440 --> 00:01:17.450 
bursts or groups of four or five notes

00:01:17.450 --> 00:01:20.380 
bursts or groups of four or five notes
whenever<00:01:18.350> possible<00:01:18.590> and<00:01:19.010> then<00:01:19.340> shift<00:01:19.670> it<00:01:20.120> also

00:01:20.380 --> 00:01:20.390 
whenever possible and then shift it also

00:01:20.390 --> 00:01:21.910 
whenever possible and then shift it also
for<00:01:20.630> me<00:01:20.750> makes<00:01:20.960> it<00:01:21.080> easier<00:01:21.320> to<00:01:21.380> memorize<00:01:21.530> now

00:01:21.910 --> 00:01:21.920 
for me makes it easier to memorize now

00:01:21.920 --> 00:01:23.770 
for me makes it easier to memorize now
here's<00:01:22.159> one<00:01:22.700> pattern<00:01:23.000> that<00:01:23.330> you<00:01:23.420> can<00:01:23.570> use<00:01:23.750> for

00:01:23.770 --> 00:01:23.780 
here's one pattern that you can use for

00:01:23.780 --> 00:01:26.770 
here's one pattern that you can use for
C<00:01:24.110> major<00:01:24.320> I'll<00:01:24.920> play<00:01:25.280> up<00:01:25.430> to<00:01:25.460> the<00:01:25.670> fifth<00:01:25.909> as<00:01:26.090> if

00:01:26.770 --> 00:01:26.780 
C major I'll play up to the fifth as if

00:01:26.780 --> 00:01:28.090 
C major I'll play up to the fifth as if
I<00:01:26.870> was<00:01:26.990> playing<00:01:27.110> the<00:01:27.290> normal<00:01:27.590> one<00:01:27.799> octave

00:01:28.090 --> 00:01:28.100 
I was playing the normal one octave

00:01:28.100 --> 00:01:31.480 
I was playing the normal one octave
fingery<00:01:29.049> all<00:01:30.049> right<00:01:30.200> now<00:01:30.680> I'm<00:01:30.799> on<00:01:30.920> the<00:01:31.070> G<00:01:31.280> I'm

00:01:31.480 --> 00:01:31.490 
fingery all right now I'm on the G I'm

00:01:31.490 --> 00:01:33.130 
fingery all right now I'm on the G I'm
going<00:01:31.610> to<00:01:31.670> shift<00:01:31.880> up<00:01:32.030> to<00:01:32.180> the<00:01:32.270> a<00:01:32.299> on<00:01:32.840> the<00:01:32.990> D

going to shift up to the a on the D

00:01:33.140 --> 00:01:34.660 
going to shift up to the a on the D
string<00:01:33.170> and<00:01:33.619> that's<00:01:33.920> on<00:01:34.130> the<00:01:34.220> seventh<00:01:34.549> fret

00:01:34.660 --> 00:01:34.670 
string and that's on the seventh fret

00:01:34.670 --> 00:01:39.719 
string and that's on the seventh fret
and<00:01:34.970> I'll<00:01:35.510> play<00:01:35.780> a<00:01:36.490> pattern<00:01:37.490> of<00:01:37.640> six<00:01:37.880> notes

00:01:39.719 --> 00:01:39.729 
and I'll play a pattern of six notes

00:01:39.729 --> 00:01:42.969 
and I'll play a pattern of six notes
okay<00:01:40.729> and<00:01:41.150> then<00:01:41.570> I<00:01:41.840> have<00:01:42.110> two<00:01:42.290> choices<00:01:42.440> I<00:01:42.740> can

00:01:42.969 --> 00:01:42.979 
okay and then I have two choices I can

00:01:42.979 --> 00:01:44.890 
okay and then I have two choices I can
play<00:01:43.159> the<00:01:43.430> twelfth<00:01:43.729> fret<00:01:43.820> G<00:01:44.119> in<00:01:44.390> the<00:01:44.510> 14th

play the twelfth fret G in the 14th

00:01:44.900 --> 00:01:46.899 
play the twelfth fret G in the 14th
birthday<00:01:45.049> and<00:01:45.590> they<00:01:45.710> shift<00:01:45.920> up<00:01:46.159> and<00:01:46.400> play<00:01:46.610> the

00:01:46.899 --> 00:01:46.909 
birthday and they shift up and play the

00:01:46.909 --> 00:01:49.990 
birthday and they shift up and play the
B<00:01:47.240> and<00:01:47.540> the<00:01:47.600> C<00:01:47.689> or<00:01:48.619> if<00:01:49.070> your<00:01:49.520> hands<00:01:49.729> are<00:01:49.880> big

00:01:49.990 --> 00:01:50.000 
B and the C or if your hands are big

00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:52.480 
B and the C or if your hands are big
enough<00:01:50.090> you<00:01:50.330> can<00:01:50.479> actually<00:01:50.630> play<00:01:51.020> it<00:01:51.490> without

00:01:52.480 --> 00:01:52.490 
enough you can actually play it without

00:01:52.490 --> 00:01:55.990 
enough you can actually play it without
shifting<00:01:52.939> so<00:01:54.010> slowly<00:01:55.010> here's<00:01:55.430> that<00:01:55.670> pattern

00:01:55.990 --> 00:01:56.000 
shifting so slowly here's that pattern

00:01:56.000 --> 00:01:57.670 
shifting so slowly here's that pattern
and<00:01:56.210> it's<00:01:56.420> just<00:01:56.659> one<00:01:56.840> pattern<00:01:57.080> but<00:01:57.260> here's<00:01:57.409> one

00:01:57.670 --> 00:01:57.680 
and it's just one pattern but here's one

00:01:57.680 --> 00:02:06.690 
and it's just one pattern but here's one
pattern<00:01:57.890> you<00:01:58.070> can<00:01:58.100> try

00:02:06.690 --> 00:02:06.700 

00:02:06.700 --> 00:02:09.790 

so<00:02:07.700> that's<00:02:07.820> one<00:02:08.060> pattern<00:02:08.349> there's<00:02:09.349> many<00:02:09.709> other

00:02:09.790 --> 00:02:09.800 
so that's one pattern there's many other

00:02:09.800 --> 00:02:12.940 
so that's one pattern there's many other
patterns<00:02:10.369> that<00:02:11.090> you<00:02:11.150> can<00:02:11.390> work<00:02:12.200> on<00:02:12.380> and<00:02:12.800> also

00:02:12.940 --> 00:02:12.950 
patterns that you can work on and also

00:02:12.950 --> 00:02:15.190 
patterns that you can work on and also
work<00:02:13.280> them<00:02:13.459> from<00:02:13.700> every<00:02:14.060> the<00:02:14.660> route<00:02:14.840> starting

00:02:15.190 --> 00:02:15.200 
work them from every the route starting

00:02:15.200 --> 00:02:17.650 
work them from every the route starting
on<00:02:15.349> every<00:02:15.650> string<00:02:16.010> especially<00:02:16.880> for<00:02:17.120> you<00:02:17.239> five

00:02:17.650 --> 00:02:17.660 
on every string especially for you five

00:02:17.660 --> 00:02:19.720 
on every string especially for you five
string<00:02:17.900> 6<00:02:18.140> string<00:02:18.319> players<00:02:18.560> honestly<00:02:19.550> on<00:02:19.700> a

00:02:19.720 --> 00:02:19.730 
string 6 string players honestly on a

00:02:19.730 --> 00:02:21.460 
string 6 string players honestly on a
five<00:02:19.910> string<00:02:20.120> 6<00:02:20.390> string<00:02:20.599> two<00:02:20.780> octaves<00:02:21.140> is<00:02:21.290> very

00:02:21.460 --> 00:02:21.470 
five string 6 string two octaves is very

00:02:21.470 --> 00:02:22.900 
five string 6 string two octaves is very
simple<00:02:21.739> so<00:02:22.010> you<00:02:22.069> may<00:02:22.190> wanna<00:02:22.400> start<00:02:22.580> practicing

00:02:22.900 --> 00:02:22.910 
simple so you may wanna start practicing

00:02:22.910 --> 00:02:25.870 
simple so you may wanna start practicing
your<00:02:22.970> three<00:02:23.269> octaves<00:02:23.660> we<00:02:24.349> do<00:02:24.590> this<00:02:24.800> so<00:02:25.040> we<00:02:25.430> we

00:02:25.870 --> 00:02:25.880 
your three octaves we do this so we we

00:02:25.880 --> 00:02:28.660 
your three octaves we do this so we we
learn<00:02:26.150> paths<00:02:26.630> off<00:02:27.050> for<00:02:27.830> every<00:02:28.069> scale<00:02:28.310> we<00:02:28.489> know

00:02:28.660 --> 00:02:28.670 
learn paths off for every scale we know

00:02:28.670 --> 00:02:30.610 
learn paths off for every scale we know
so<00:02:29.209> we're<00:02:29.420> not<00:02:29.540> when<00:02:30.050> we're<00:02:30.200> jamming<00:02:30.560> a

00:02:30.610 --> 00:02:30.620 
so we're not when we're jamming a

00:02:30.620 --> 00:02:32.110 
so we're not when we're jamming a
friend's<00:02:30.920> we're<00:02:31.040> not<00:02:31.160> stuck<00:02:31.519> in<00:02:31.550> a<00:02:31.760> little<00:02:31.910> box

00:02:32.110 --> 00:02:32.120 
friend's we're not stuck in a little box

00:02:32.120 --> 00:02:33.729 
friend's we're not stuck in a little box
of<00:02:32.360> one<00:02:32.569> octave<00:02:32.959> we<00:02:33.110> want<00:02:33.290> to<00:02:33.380> be<00:02:33.440> able<00:02:33.500> to<00:02:33.650> just

00:02:33.729 --> 00:02:33.739 
of one octave we want to be able to just

00:02:33.739 --> 00:02:36.190 
of one octave we want to be able to just
freely<00:02:34.160> go<00:02:34.280> up<00:02:34.430> and<00:02:34.580> down<00:02:34.670> the<00:02:34.849> neck<00:02:35.030> now<00:02:35.330> when

00:02:36.190 --> 00:02:36.200 
freely go up and down the neck now when

00:02:36.200 --> 00:02:39.339 
freely go up and down the neck now when
creating<00:02:36.830> your<00:02:37.430> own<00:02:37.910> to<00:02:38.209> dr.<00:02:38.630> fingerings<00:02:38.989> it's

00:02:39.339 --> 00:02:39.349 
creating your own to dr. fingerings it's

00:02:39.349 --> 00:02:41.110 
creating your own to dr. fingerings it's
so<00:02:39.650> much<00:02:39.830> easier<00:02:39.860> if<00:02:40.370> you<00:02:40.489> just<00:02:40.519> take<00:02:40.760> a<00:02:40.819> moment

00:02:41.110 --> 00:02:41.120 
so much easier if you just take a moment

00:02:41.120 --> 00:02:43.479 
so much easier if you just take a moment
and<00:02:41.450> look<00:02:41.959> at<00:02:42.110> the<00:02:42.200> notes<00:02:42.410> in<00:02:42.590> the<00:02:42.680> scale<00:02:42.980> let's

00:02:43.479 --> 00:02:43.489 
and look at the notes in the scale let's

00:02:43.489 --> 00:02:45.670 
and look at the notes in the scale let's
go<00:02:43.640> to<00:02:43.700> the<00:02:43.910> G<00:02:44.480> Major<00:02:44.630> scale<00:02:44.810> and<00:02:45.260> the<00:02:45.380> G<00:02:45.530> Major

00:02:45.670 --> 00:02:45.680 
go to the G Major scale and the G Major

00:02:45.680 --> 00:02:47.440 
go to the G Major scale and the G Major
scale<00:02:45.830> all<00:02:46.250> the<00:02:46.459> notes<00:02:46.640> are<00:02:46.819> natural<00:02:47.150> but<00:02:47.360> the

00:02:47.440 --> 00:02:47.450 
scale all the notes are natural but the

00:02:47.450 --> 00:02:49.539 
scale all the notes are natural but the
f<00:02:47.599> is<00:02:47.780> sharp<00:02:48.049> so<00:02:48.530> by<00:02:48.709> keeping<00:02:48.890> that<00:02:49.130> in<00:02:49.250> my<00:02:49.340> mind

00:02:49.539 --> 00:02:49.549 
f is sharp so by keeping that in my mind

00:02:49.549 --> 00:02:52.089 
f is sharp so by keeping that in my mind
and<00:02:49.849> knowing<00:02:50.390> the<00:02:50.569> fingerboard<00:02:50.989> i<00:02:51.410> can

00:03:22.120 --> 00:03:22.130 
becomes much easier to create two octave

00:03:22.130 --> 00:03:24.400 
becomes much easier to create two octave
patterns<00:03:22.519> so<00:03:23.030> add<00:03:23.239> that<00:03:23.269> to<00:03:23.630> practice<00:03:24.049> routine
