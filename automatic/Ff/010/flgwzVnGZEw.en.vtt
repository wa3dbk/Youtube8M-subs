 half a century ago at this place almost 

00:00:02.370 --> 00:00:06.660
 went to the bottom of the barge with food century 

00:00:04.770 --> 00:00:09.389
 high tech water bridge 

00:00:06.660 --> 00:00:12.179
 prevented seeming trifles in inflatable 

00:00:09.389 --> 00:00:14.160
 boats spoiled valve it's about time 

00:00:12.179 --> 00:00:16.440
 suspicious to think that the situation 

00:00:14.160 --> 00:00:19.850
 hostile to intruders 

00:00:16.440 --> 00:00:21.570
 sat upper mamon valve fell under ate 

00:00:19.850 --> 00:00:24.330
 had to again 

00:00:21.570 --> 00:00:26.640
 disassemble to pull the valve at the end 

00:00:24.330 --> 00:00:28.439
 Forties from Voronezh only lazy 

00:00:26.640 --> 00:00:31.289
 did not retell the story of how 

00:00:28.439 --> 00:00:34.559
 tank barrel underwater ripped up the bottom 

00:00:31.289 --> 00:00:37.020
 ship with grain a year later to see 

00:00:34.559 --> 00:00:40.850
 on how they will blow up a tank under water 

00:00:37.020 --> 00:00:40.850
 kids gathered from around 

00:00:43.320 --> 00:00:47.370
 on a survey carried out with magnets 

00:00:46.710 --> 00:00:49.320
 Besides 

00:00:47.370 --> 00:00:51.930
 Scanning space on the frame was 

00:00:49.320 --> 00:00:55.050
 confirmed the tank is at the bottom 

00:00:51.930 --> 00:00:58.440
 Museum of Armored Forces in the city 

00:00:55.050 --> 00:01:00.989
 Cuban addressed us with a request yet 

00:00:58.440 --> 00:01:02.699
 time to make a survey confirm 

00:01:00.989 --> 00:01:06.000
 in what condition are now 

00:01:02.699 --> 00:01:08.280
 debris on this tank and then and now 

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:10.530
 despite all sorts of echo sounder 

00:01:08.280 --> 00:01:12.800
 touchscreen forty seven and a half tons 

00:01:10.530 --> 00:01:15.930
 armor at a depth of a couple of tens of meters 

00:01:12.800 --> 00:01:18.600
 look at all and not so impressive on 

00:01:15.930 --> 00:01:21.390
 battlefield kv-1 feared like fire 

00:01:18.600 --> 00:01:24.539
 for the incredible vitality of the Germans even 

00:01:21.390 --> 00:01:26.580
 called him a ghost today excitement 

00:01:24.539 --> 00:01:27.479
 the descendants of those who sat at the levers 

00:01:26.580 --> 00:01:30.240
 of management 

00:01:27.479 --> 00:01:33.170
 heavy tank and search was difficult and 

00:01:30.240 --> 00:01:34.640
 bringing the ghost to life will be hard 

00:01:33.170 --> 00:01:38.850
 put gui 

00:01:34.640 --> 00:01:41.670
 over the tower and it is necessary to debris main 

00:01:38.850 --> 00:01:44.270
 transmission case there we will make tanks 

00:01:41.670 --> 00:01:46.440
 metric shooting that figure out the depths 

00:01:44.270 --> 00:01:48.050
 which is now in the river 

00:01:46.440 --> 00:01:50.210
 so that later 

00:01:48.050 --> 00:01:52.730
 it was clear in what direction on 

00:01:50.210 --> 00:01:57.290
 which shore will be easier to pull out 

00:01:52.730 --> 00:01:59.320
 tanks the fruits of the events of the times great 

00:01:57.290 --> 00:02:01.670
 patriotic war have upper mammon 

00:01:59.320 --> 00:02:03.610
 occurred on these calendar days 

00:02:01.670 --> 00:02:08.540
 Soviet troops went on the offensive 

00:02:03.610 --> 00:02:10.820
 in the morning of December 16, 1942 at the end of the day 

00:02:08.540 --> 00:02:13.640
 Soviet soldiers broke through the defense 

00:02:10.820 --> 00:02:15.470
 adversary and advanced by 25 

00:02:13.640 --> 00:02:18.200
 kilometers deep into the occupied 

00:02:15.470 --> 00:02:20.840
 territories three days later 19 

00:02:18.200 --> 00:02:23.330
 December, the war was conquered 

00:02:20.840 --> 00:02:26.150
 under the new year operation is small 

00:02:23.330 --> 00:02:29.030
 Saturn is essentially over for only 

00:02:26.150 --> 00:02:31.380
 one of the participants of the battle square-1 all 

00:02:29.030 --> 00:02:35.100
 completed earlier 

00:02:31.380 --> 00:02:38.280
 during the war heavy tank whom went 

00:02:35.100 --> 00:02:40.140
 here at the crossing in winter slid off 

00:02:38.280 --> 00:02:42.690
 frostbitten logs 

00:02:40.140 --> 00:02:45.960
 at crossing to the side and fell under 

00:02:42.690 --> 00:02:49.490
 ice since the tank was a hard attempt 

00:02:45.960 --> 00:02:52.230
 during the offensive was not empty 

00:02:49.490 --> 00:02:56.630
 opportunities well and when the ice melted it 

00:02:52.230 --> 00:02:59.280
 left 1 well and for 65 years the project was taken 

00:02:56.630 --> 00:03:01.320
 probably from the company no one likes 

00:02:59.280 --> 00:03:04.320
 legends of the second world war both 

00:03:01.320 --> 00:03:07.650
 wargaming is essentially the whole project of the world of tanks 

00:03:04.320 --> 00:03:10.020
 is legendary and not so much because 

00:03:07.650 --> 00:03:12.720
 a huge number of fans how many 

00:03:10.020 --> 00:03:15.030
 because of the gaming universe itself the tank 

00:03:12.720 --> 00:03:17.910
 battles of the second world war themselves 

00:03:15.030 --> 00:03:20.250
 se legends how to contribute 

00:03:17.910 --> 00:03:22.950
 study of that period of wargaming 

00:03:20.250 --> 00:03:24.960
 launched a global search program 

00:03:22.950 --> 00:03:28.500
 and restoration of historical samples 

00:03:24.960 --> 00:03:30.510
 military vehicles around the world discovered 

00:03:28.500 --> 00:03:32.730
 square 1 in the Voronezh region 

00:03:30.510 --> 00:03:35.190
 this is the first result after the start 

00:03:32.730 --> 00:03:37.860
 program whose goal is to maintain 

00:03:35.190 --> 00:03:39.330
 memory of the people who created the tanks 

00:03:37.860 --> 00:03:42.240
 ships and airplanes 

00:03:39.330 --> 00:03:44.630
 period of the second world war were collected 

00:03:42.240 --> 00:03:47.940
 for them, the units and assemblies made 

00:03:44.630 --> 00:03:50.210
 multi-ton machines move and protect 

00:03:47.940 --> 00:03:50.210
 us 

00:03:54.530 --> 00:04:05.080
 the guys are doing the 3rd thing right now 

00:03:59.780 --> 00:04:09.410
 measure the depths of something to put the tablet 

00:04:05.080 --> 00:04:11.830
 depths make a map but in reality 

00:04:09.410 --> 00:04:14.209
 recovery is a year or two of work 

00:04:11.830 --> 00:04:16.660
 planned to get the equipment from the bottom to 

00:04:14.209 --> 00:04:19.250
 new year but because of the difficult terrain 

00:04:16.660 --> 00:04:21.769
 the operation had to be postponed at least 

00:04:19.250 --> 00:04:24.110
 until spring all you can do today 

00:04:21.769 --> 00:04:26.960
 specify the location of danco 

00:04:24.110 --> 00:04:28.810
 plan a lift operation and in 

00:04:26.960 --> 00:04:31.010
 depending on the complexity of the relief 

00:04:28.810 --> 00:04:33.680
 determine which bank it 

00:04:31.010 --> 00:04:36.320
 drag while operation date yet 

00:04:33.680 --> 00:04:38.870
 only determined so the details 

00:04:36.320 --> 00:04:41.500
 operations in the following reports are not 

00:04:38.870 --> 00:04:41.500
 miss out
