00:00:12.900 --> 00:00:18.279
 let's go back from this new episode 

00:00:15.730 --> 00:00:20.290
 class for power today episode 

00:00:18.279 --> 00:00:22.180
 Christmas I'm here to tell you about the 

00:00:20.290 --> 00:00:24.160
 census that you have certainly seen in 

00:00:22.180 --> 00:00:25.840
 one of my videos i want to talk about 

00:00:24.160 --> 00:00:28.329
 this weapon not because a strong weapon that is 

00:00:25.840 --> 00:00:29.590
 let it be a very heavy weapon, though 

00:00:28.329 --> 00:00:31.180
 of which I want to tell you about the fact that a 

00:00:29.590 --> 00:00:34.660
 weapon if as it is very fun to use 

00:00:31.180 --> 00:00:37.059
 and nice because this is because it is 

00:00:34.660 --> 00:00:39.640
 different from others does not have a viewfinder and if 

00:00:37.059 --> 00:00:40.960
 used with predator it is very strange among 

00:00:39.640 --> 00:00:42.699
 the other at the very small crosses 

00:00:40.960 --> 00:00:43.960
 because it has an integrated laser sight like 

00:00:42.699 --> 00:00:45.489
 you can read in the description 

00:00:43.960 --> 00:00:46.960
 however use 

00:00:45.489 --> 00:00:49.120
 the Christmas spirit because it does more 

00:00:46.960 --> 00:00:50.949
 damage is easier than bed bugs is not true 

00:00:49.120 --> 00:00:52.570
 I'm saying a crap that is directed 

00:00:50.949 --> 00:00:54.699
 navy Christmas just because so 

00:00:52.570 --> 00:00:56.199
 free then off in the Christmas air 

00:00:54.699 --> 00:00:57.820
 however between this right the 

00:00:56.199 --> 00:01:00.519
 silencer because this is here 

00:00:57.820 --> 00:01:03.609
 a weapon that at 85 rounds more or less if not 

00:01:00.519 --> 00:01:04.989
 wrong or a hundred and used a sensor 

00:01:03.609 --> 00:01:06.190
 I think it's very convenient because you have 

00:01:04.989 --> 00:01:08.740
 many shots 

00:01:06.190 --> 00:01:11.470
 so you can make so many gills in a row 

00:01:08.740 --> 00:01:12.850
 without that chimney and in combination 

00:01:11.470 --> 00:01:13.840
 with rapid fire have another 

00:01:12.850 --> 00:01:15.400
 fire volume 

00:01:13.840 --> 00:01:17.710
 yellow to itself another volume 

00:01:15.400 --> 00:01:19.360
 fire but if used with rapid fire 

00:01:17.710 --> 00:01:20.650
 especially hearths become admitted 

00:01:19.360 --> 00:01:25.090
 silencer is really a thing 

00:01:20.650 --> 00:01:27.750
 both as regards the specialty 

00:01:25.090 --> 00:01:31.060
 that I'm using readiness use 

00:01:27.750 --> 00:01:34.450
 concentration predator and center 

00:01:31.060 --> 00:01:36.870
 perfect use perfect center in 

00:01:34.450 --> 00:01:39.970
 this case because it is silenced 

00:01:36.870 --> 00:01:41.080
 it does not do much damage though 

00:01:39.970 --> 00:01:43.780
 with the other a name of fire that 

00:01:41.080 --> 00:01:45.700
 through little quick and through 

00:01:43.780 --> 00:01:47.890
 aiming crosses have perfect center 

00:01:45.700 --> 00:01:49.690
 right away as soon as you make four villas 

00:01:47.890 --> 00:01:51.970
 you have a chance of a hit 

00:01:49.690 --> 00:01:54.010
 critical becomes a massacre with 

00:01:51.970 --> 00:01:55.750
 this weapon because it does fearful damage 

00:01:54.010 --> 00:01:56.080
 especially with another volume of 

00:01:55.750 --> 00:01:58.510
 fire 

00:01:56.080 --> 00:02:00.640
 however, as a series package you don't 

00:01:58.510 --> 00:02:03.490
 I show quick extraction of 

00:02:00.640 --> 00:02:05.020
 I say quick draw because me 

00:02:03.490 --> 00:02:06.280
 allows you to aim quickly then 

00:02:05.020 --> 00:02:08.319
 because with this weapon you can admire 

00:02:06.280 --> 00:02:10.209
 in the end however it is not manageable ie not 

00:02:08.319 --> 00:02:11.890
 it is just aiming to restrict only 

00:02:10.209 --> 00:02:14.319
 the crosses so it's so cool to play 

00:02:11.890 --> 00:02:15.110
 so you always shoot nymph then jackal 

00:02:14.319 --> 00:02:16.610
 to enlarge them 

00:02:15.110 --> 00:02:18.860
 the sleight of hand load more 

00:02:16.610 --> 00:02:21.470
 quickly because being a hundred 

00:02:18.860 --> 00:02:23.090
 this weapon really takes a long time 

00:02:21.470 --> 00:02:25.670
 infinite to recharge it third game of 

00:02:23.090 --> 00:02:27.620
 prestige speeds up this recharge 

00:02:25.670 --> 00:02:28.850
 agility so that I used in 

00:02:27.620 --> 00:02:30.410
 combination with predator be 

00:02:28.850 --> 00:02:32.450
 fast moving right 

00:02:30.410 --> 00:02:34.190
 left aims stable because it aims 

00:02:32.450 --> 00:02:35.780
 stable together at least integrated laser 

00:02:34.190 --> 00:02:37.280
 of the weapon reduces even more 

00:02:35.780 --> 00:02:39.590
 spreaders makes a lot, but very much 

00:02:37.280 --> 00:02:41.209
 much much smaller than that 

00:02:39.590 --> 00:02:43.610
 armored shield to avoid being 

00:02:41.209 --> 00:02:46.310
 killed by grenades than by systems 

00:02:43.610 --> 00:02:48.740
 craft that are truly an abortion 

00:02:46.310 --> 00:02:50.720
 in this game you find them wherever they do 

00:02:48.740 --> 00:02:51.650
 very badly impossible to iron 

00:02:50.720 --> 00:02:53.600
 etc. etc. 

00:02:51.650 --> 00:02:56.180
 and then inflexible so as to pull the 

00:02:53.600 --> 00:02:57.470
 range 24 kg and not 25 even less if 

00:02:56.180 --> 00:02:58.700
 do assists 

00:02:57.470 --> 00:03:00.260
 so this is the class the gameplay 

00:02:58.700 --> 00:03:03.230
 which tastes like background I am not playing 

00:03:00.260 --> 00:03:05.330
 with this weapon I hope you like it because 

00:03:03.230 --> 00:03:09.730
 I think it's a very nice gameplay 

00:03:05.330 --> 00:03:09.730
 so we leave the video on the bce
