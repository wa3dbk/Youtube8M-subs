00:02:02.600 --> 00:02:02.610 
gorgeous color I having to use this yet

00:02:02.610 --> 00:02:09.040 
gorgeous color I having to use this yet
but<00:02:04.610> super<00:02:05.610> pretty<00:02:06.140> just<00:02:07.140> looks<00:02:07.349> like<00:02:07.440> that

00:02:09.040 --> 00:02:09.050 
but super pretty just looks like that

00:02:09.050 --> 00:02:14.360 
but super pretty just looks like that
and<00:02:10.310> this<00:02:11.310> one<00:02:11.640> I<00:02:11.910> believe<00:02:12.240> was<00:02:13.190> twenty<00:02:14.190> eight

00:02:14.360 --> 00:02:14.370 
and this one I believe was twenty eight

00:02:14.370 --> 00:02:16.339 
and this one I believe was twenty eight
dollars<00:02:14.400> a<00:02:15.090> little<00:02:15.330> bit<00:02:15.450> pricey<00:02:15.720> for<00:02:15.900> the<00:02:16.170> lip

00:02:16.339 --> 00:02:16.349 
dollars a little bit pricey for the lip

00:02:16.349 --> 00:02:18.620 
dollars a little bit pricey for the lip
gloss<00:02:16.620> I<00:02:17.040> think<00:02:17.940> that<00:02:18.060> was<00:02:18.150> it<00:02:18.300> for<00:02:18.330> the

00:02:18.620 --> 00:02:18.630 
gloss I think that was it for the

00:02:18.630 --> 00:02:21.470 
gloss I think that was it for the
Sephora<00:02:19.050> haul<00:02:19.160> I<00:02:20.160> also<00:02:20.550> made<00:02:20.910> an<00:02:21.030> order<00:02:21.240> to

close the sense because they were having

00:02:23.010 --> 00:02:24.740 
close the sense because they were having
the<00:02:23.099> twenty<00:02:23.400> percent<00:02:23.430> off<00:02:23.880> still<00:02:24.150> there<00:02:24.360> 88
