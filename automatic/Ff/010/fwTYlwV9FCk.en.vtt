00:00:01.490 --> 00:00:05.000
In the name of God, most Great and most Merciful.

00:00:07.490 --> 00:00:15.000
Dear beloved brothers and sisters, respected organizers..

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:18.000
A warm welcome to you all.

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:23.000
This is your home; this is your country.

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:28.000
(applause)

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:39.000
Today - in Erbil, the capital of the Kurdistan Region - should be remembered for this proud gathering. 

00:00:42.490 --> 00:00:54.000
We hope this gathering will be a successful one and that the goals and objectives of this conference will be met.

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:06.000
The purpose of this Conference for the Western (Syrian) Kurdish Expatriates is...

00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:19.000
...to research and highlight the current outstanding problems. 

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:28.000
And to agree on the necessary action and readiness [of your coalition] for any possible outcome [in Syria].

00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:35.000
As witnessed, there have been enormous changes [in the Middle East] from the past to present 

00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:46.000
The changes continue and it is our belief that no force and no regime can prevent these changes from occuring.
0:001:48.000,0:01:46.000
It is imperative that the Kurdish people prepare themselves for future outcomes. 

00:01:57.000 --> 00:02:03.000
For [the Kurdistan Regional Government], the situation in Syria is a very important one. 

00:02:03.500 --> 00:02:10.000
It is not only important because Syria is a neighboring country and we share a long border... 

00:02:11.500 --> 00:02:16.000
[It is important] because there are more than 2 million Kurds living in Syria.

00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:26.500
The outcome of changes that occur or that are implemented [in Syria] is important to us because it involves the situation of our brothers, the Kurds of Syria. 

00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:36.000
It is important [to us] that Kurds are not deprived of any of their rights in a future Syria.

00:02:38.500 --> 00:02:47.500
It is my hope that you are well-prepared for any changes that come

00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:56.000
And the changes that are made in Syria will also be beneficial to and hold consideration for the situation of [the Kurdish people].

00:02:57.500 --> 00:03:02.400
However, the changes are not my government's to make nor is it the decision of any other foreign entity. 

00:03:02.500 --> 00:03:09.000
It is the job of the people of Syria - the Arabs, Kurds, and all other nations in Syria.

00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:18.000
This is important to us but we also intend to observe the changes closely

00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:33.000
We do not want to interfere in your affairs in any way. 

00:03:34.000 --> 00:03:43.000
We only wish to assist you with the opportunity to gather here in this land, your own country, where freedom is assured... 

00:03:44.000 --> 00:03:47.000
...to formulate your own policies and decisions. 

00:03:48.000 --> 00:03:53.000
We will support the policies that [your coaltition] formulates... 

00:03:55.000 --> 00:04:05.000
This is on the condition that your policies are free from violence. 

00:04:05.500 --> 00:04:12.000
Your coalition should [instead] uphold the principles of peace and democracy, and uphold a principle of dialogue.

00:04:13.500 --> 00:04:16.000
We do not know what the final outcome of Syria will be. 

00:04:17.000 --> 00:04:21.000
We hope there will be changes soon. 

00:04:22.000 --> 00:04:28.000
However, your coalition must prepare in advance for any changes that do come. 

00:04:32.000 --> 00:04:36.000
We intend to fully support the consensus you reach.

00:04:37.000 --> 00:04:42.000
This is a very critical moment, a very sensitive time.

00:04:43.000 --> 00:04:47.500
Therefore, you must distance yourselves from partisanship. 

00:04:48.000 --> 00:04:53.000
Until the situation in Syria is certain, the Kurdish people must be united. 

00:04:54.000 --> 00:04:55.000
(applause)

00:05:00.000 --> 00:05:12.000
You must work together under the umbrella of Kurdish aspirations and be mindful and respect the opinions of one another's parties. 

00:05:13.500 --> 00:05:17.000
We can only support you on condition that you remain united.

00:05:18.000 --> 00:05:29.000
As Kurdish brothers, until this critical time in Syria passes, that you distance yourselves from partisanship and avoid internal conflict.

00:05:29.500 --> 00:05:35.000
And that you prepare yourselves for a bright future.  

00:05:36.000 --> 00:05:41.000
(applause)

00:05:43.000 --> 00:05:51.000
We believe in this manner that, Godwilling, there will be positive outcomes for you all.

00:05:53.500 --> 00:06:06.000
Finally, we hope, Godwilling, that next year all Kurdistanis can gather for another conference in this same place. 

00:06:07.000 --> 00:06:12.000
(applause)

00:06:13.000 --> 00:06:20.500
The purpose will be to create a united discourse among all Kurdistanis.

00:06:21.000 --> 00:06:26.000
We are a peace-loving nation with a great history

00:06:33.000 --> 00:06:36.500
But we will not abandon our struggle. 

00:06:37.000 --> 00:06:42.000
It is a struggle for peace, a struggle for democracy, a struggle for dialogue.

00:06:43.000 --> 00:06:47.000
The era in which the existence of Kurds is denied is no more. 

00:06:47.500 --> 00:06:50.000
The era of armed struggled is over as well. 

00:06:51.000 --> 00:06:59.000
Today, we live in an era in which [we seek] peace, democracy, and coexistence. 

00:06:59.500 --> 00:07:05.000
Today is a new page in history for the [relationship] between nations. 

00:07:05.500 --> 00:07:14.500
The intention of this conference is to extend the hand of brotherhood and peace; to extend that hand to our Arab, Turkish, and Persian brothers. 

00:07:15.000 --> 00:07:23.000
And to let the world know that we are a nation seeking peace and not one of weapons and war. 

00:07:24.000 --> 00:07:30.000
And we we will continue our struggle in this manner to demand our rights.

00:07:34.000 --> 00:07:36.000
I do not wish to take more of your time here today. 

00:07:36.500 --> 00:07:40.000
I would only like to once again warmly welcome you all. 

00:07:40.500 --> 00:07:43.500
This is your home and you are among your own people here. 

00:07:44.000 --> 00:07:49.000
I wish you success in all your efforts. God bless you all and God bless Kurdistan.
