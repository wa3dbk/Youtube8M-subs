take the magic trial hydrate that edge a

00:00:55.860 --> 00:01:00.110 
take the magic trial hydrate that edge a
little<00:00:56.190> bit<00:00:56.370> with<00:00:57.180> a<00:00:57.210> damp<00:00:58.250> sponge<00:00:59.250> and<00:00:59.879> then

00:01:00.110 --> 00:01:00.120 
little bit with a damp sponge and then

00:01:00.120 --> 00:01:03.560 
little bit with a damp sponge and then
just<00:01:00.360> gently<00:01:00.980> knock<00:01:01.980> down<00:01:02.280> the<00:01:02.460> peaks<00:01:02.760> this

00:01:03.560 --> 00:01:03.570 
just gently knock down the peaks this

00:01:03.570 --> 00:01:06.440 
just gently knock down the peaks this
will<00:01:03.840> eliminate<00:01:04.020> all<00:01:04.470> the<00:01:04.770> sharp<00:01:05.270> peaks<00:01:06.270> that

00:01:06.440 --> 00:01:06.450 
will eliminate all the sharp peaks that

00:01:06.450 --> 00:01:08.900 
will eliminate all the sharp peaks that
you<00:01:06.600> would<00:01:06.810> get<00:01:07.020> otherwise<00:01:07.580> we'll<00:01:08.580> let<00:01:08.759> this

00:01:08.900 --> 00:01:08.910 
you would get otherwise we'll let this

00:01:08.910 --> 00:01:11.200 
you would get otherwise we'll let this
dry<00:01:09.300> for<00:01:09.990> several<00:01:10.200> hours<00:01:10.500> to<00:01:10.950> overnight

00:01:15.050 --> 00:01:15.060 
before we come back and base coat that

00:01:15.060 --> 00:01:18.200 
before we come back and base coat that
with<00:01:15.330> an<00:01:15.840> acrylic<00:01:16.170> wall<00:01:16.590> paint<00:01:16.920> the<00:01:17.640> next<00:01:17.970> step

with an acrylic wall paint the next step

00:01:18.210 --> 00:01:20.150 
with an acrylic wall paint the next step
for<00:01:18.479> our<00:01:18.539> finish<00:01:18.929> will<00:01:19.140> be<00:01:19.259> to<00:01:19.410> put<00:01:19.619> a<00:01:19.649> solid

00:01:20.150 --> 00:01:20.160 
for our finish will be to put a solid

coat of an off-white paint on the
surface<00:01:23.240> we're<00:01:24.240> just<00:01:24.420> gonna<00:01:24.570> roll<00:01:24.840> that<00:01:25.080> on

00:01:26.710 --> 00:01:26.720 
surface we're just gonna roll that on

00:01:26.720 --> 00:01:29.540 
surface we're just gonna roll that on
you<00:01:27.720> can<00:01:27.750> use<00:01:27.990> a<00:01:28.020> brush<00:01:28.320> along<00:01:28.679> the<00:01:28.860> edges<00:01:29.280> and

00:01:29.540 --> 00:01:29.550 
you can use a brush along the edges and

00:01:29.550 --> 00:01:33.169 
you can use a brush along the edges and
corners<00:01:30.479> of<00:01:30.570> the<00:01:30.660> room<00:01:31.670> when<00:01:32.670> you're<00:01:32.819> all<00:01:33.000> of

00:01:33.169 --> 00:01:33.179 
corners of the room when you're all of

00:01:33.179 --> 00:01:34.820 
corners of the room when you're all of
these<00:01:33.390> textured<00:01:33.869> finishes<00:01:34.229> it's<00:01:34.470> almost

00:01:34.820 --> 00:01:34.830 
these textured finishes it's almost

00:01:34.830 --> 00:01:37.999 
these textured finishes it's almost
better<00:01:35.729> to<00:01:36.000> go<00:01:36.209> in<00:01:36.990> different<00:01:37.800> directions

00:01:37.999 --> 00:01:38.009 
better to go in different directions

00:01:38.009 --> 00:01:40.760 
better to go in different directions
when<00:01:38.700> you<00:01:38.819> finish<00:01:39.149> off<00:01:39.390> so<00:01:39.810> any<00:01:40.020> roller<00:01:40.380> marks

00:01:40.760 --> 00:01:40.770 
when you finish off so any roller marks

00:01:40.770 --> 00:01:44.779 
when you finish off so any roller marks
will<00:01:41.670> be<00:01:41.789> disguised<00:01:42.209> in<00:01:42.750> the<00:01:42.899> texture<00:01:43.789> as

00:01:44.779 --> 00:01:44.789 
will be disguised in the texture as

00:01:44.789 --> 00:01:47.870 
will be disguised in the texture as
opposed<00:01:45.270> to<00:01:45.619> just<00:01:46.619> rolling<00:01:47.099> vertically<00:01:47.700> like

00:01:47.870 --> 00:01:47.880 
opposed to just rolling vertically like

00:01:47.880 --> 00:01:51.169 
opposed to just rolling vertically like
you<00:01:48.030> would<00:01:48.239> on<00:01:48.390> a<00:01:48.420> normal<00:01:49.670> coat<00:01:50.670> of<00:01:50.789> paint<00:01:51.030> for

00:01:51.169 --> 00:01:51.179 
you would on a normal coat of paint for

00:01:51.179 --> 00:01:54.800 
you would on a normal coat of paint for
a<00:01:51.390> wall<00:01:51.920> after<00:01:52.920> our<00:01:53.069> second<00:01:53.580> coat<00:01:53.789> of<00:01:54.030> latex

00:01:54.800 --> 00:01:54.810

00:01:54.810 --> 00:01:57.710 
a wall after our second coat of latex
paint<00:01:55.140> is<00:01:55.229> allowed<00:01:55.470> to<00:01:55.500> dry<00:01:56.090> we<00:01:57.090> can<00:01:57.119> mix<00:01:57.450> up<00:01:57.569> a

00:01:57.710 --> 00:01:57.720 
paint is allowed to dry we can mix up a

about 25% latex paint that's a good
starting<00:02:07.649> ratio<00:02:08.369> you<00:02:08.819> can<00:02:08.970> always<00:02:09.179> add<00:02:09.479> more

in<00:02:47.970> a<00:02:48.690> fresco<00:02:49.140> finish<00:02:49.879> I'm<00:02:50.879> going<00:02:51.060> to<00:02:51.120> use

00:02:51.199 --> 00:02:51.209 
in a fresco finish I'm going to use

00:02:51.209 --> 00:02:54.979 
in a fresco finish I'm going to use
cheesecloth<00:02:51.629> to<00:02:52.170> start<00:02:52.530> with<00:02:53.480> just<00:02:54.480> to<00:02:54.659> move

00:02:54.979 --> 00:02:54.989 
cheesecloth to start with just to move

00:02:54.989 --> 00:02:57.619 
cheesecloth to start with just to move
some<00:02:55.890> of<00:02:56.010> the<00:02:56.099> excess<00:02:56.489> glaze<00:02:56.819> and<00:02:57.239> the<00:02:57.390> brush

00:02:57.619 --> 00:02:57.629 
some of the excess glaze and the brush

00:02:57.629 --> 00:03:01.610 
some of the excess glaze and the brush
marks<00:02:58.220> some<00:02:59.220> people<00:02:59.580> like<00:02:59.819> this<00:03:00.090> finish<00:03:00.620> at

00:03:01.610 --> 00:03:01.620 
marks some people like this finish at

00:03:01.620 --> 00:03:05.360 
marks some people like this finish at
this<00:03:01.920> stage<00:03:02.420> but<00:03:03.420> if<00:03:03.540> you<00:03:03.890> move<00:03:04.890> some<00:03:05.220> of<00:03:05.310> the

00:03:05.360 --> 00:03:05.370 
this stage but if you move some of the

00:03:05.370 --> 00:03:07.550 
this stage but if you move some of the
high<00:03:05.610> spots<00:03:05.670> you'll<00:03:06.510> start<00:03:06.750> to<00:03:06.870> see<00:03:06.900> more<00:03:07.349> of

00:03:07.550 --> 00:03:07.560 
high spots you'll start to see more of

00:03:07.560 --> 00:03:11.140 
high spots you'll start to see more of
the<00:03:07.739> texture<00:03:08.299> so<00:03:09.299> I'll<00:03:09.420> use<00:03:09.599> a<00:03:09.629> dampened

00:03:11.140 --> 00:03:11.150 
the texture so I'll use a dampened

00:03:11.150 --> 00:03:14.300 
the texture so I'll use a dampened
cellulose<00:03:12.150> sponge<00:03:12.659> if<00:03:13.410> you<00:03:13.530> gently<00:03:13.920> pull<00:03:14.160> that

00:03:14.300 --> 00:03:14.310 
cellulose sponge if you gently pull that

00:03:14.310 --> 00:03:18.920 
cellulose sponge if you gently pull that
across<00:03:14.640> the<00:03:15.000> high<00:03:15.569> spots<00:03:16.400> it<00:03:17.400> will<00:03:17.930> collect

00:03:18.920 --> 00:03:18.930 
across the high spots it will collect

00:03:18.930 --> 00:03:21.259 
across the high spots it will collect
the<00:03:19.349> glaze<00:03:19.590> will<00:03:19.769> collect<00:03:20.190> in<00:03:20.400> the<00:03:20.519> low<00:03:20.730> areas

00:03:21.259 --> 00:03:21.269 
the glaze will collect in the low areas

00:03:21.269 --> 00:03:24.710 
the glaze will collect in the low areas
leaving<00:03:22.109> more<00:03:22.440> contrast<00:03:23.129> if<00:03:24.090> you<00:03:24.299> wanted<00:03:24.599> an

00:03:24.710 --> 00:03:24.720 
leaving more contrast if you wanted an

00:03:24.720 --> 00:03:28.490 
leaving more contrast if you wanted an
even<00:03:25.140> softer<00:03:25.980> finish<00:03:26.700> some<00:03:27.150> of<00:03:27.269> the<00:03:27.500> scratch

00:03:28.490 --> 00:03:28.500 
even softer finish some of the scratch

00:03:28.500 --> 00:03:31.910 
even softer finish some of the scratch
marks<00:03:29.900> created<00:03:30.900> by<00:03:30.989> the<00:03:31.049> sponge<00:03:31.500> which<00:03:31.680> could

00:03:31.910 --> 00:03:31.920 
marks created by the sponge which could

00:03:31.920 --> 00:03:34.280 
marks created by the sponge which could
be<00:03:32.040> removed<00:03:32.370> easily<00:03:32.910> with<00:03:33.329> a<00:03:33.359> badger<00:03:33.629> blender

00:03:34.280 --> 00:03:34.290 
be removed easily with a badger blender

00:03:34.290 --> 00:03:36.559 
be removed easily with a badger blender
so<00:03:34.920> this<00:03:35.129> is<00:03:35.280> for<00:03:35.459> a<00:03:35.489> little<00:03:35.609> higher<00:03:35.910> contrast

00:03:36.559 --> 00:03:36.569 
so this is for a little higher contrast

00:03:36.569 --> 00:03:39.170 
so this is for a little higher contrast
finish<00:03:37.079> if<00:03:37.769> you<00:03:38.010> accidentally<00:03:38.640> remove<00:03:38.910> too

00:03:39.170 --> 00:03:39.180 
finish if you accidentally remove too

00:03:39.180 --> 00:03:42.530 
finish if you accidentally remove too
much<00:03:39.209> of<00:03:39.510> the<00:03:39.599> glaze<00:03:40.010> you<00:03:41.010> can<00:03:41.190> go<00:03:41.340> back<00:03:41.579> and

00:03:42.530 --> 00:03:42.540 
much of the glaze you can go back and

00:03:42.540 --> 00:03:45.860 
much of the glaze you can go back and
repair<00:03:43.019> areas<00:03:43.500> with<00:03:43.829> the<00:03:43.980> brush<00:03:44.690> just<00:03:45.690> by

00:03:45.860 --> 00:03:45.870 
repair areas with the brush just by

00:03:45.870 --> 00:03:49.819 
repair areas with the brush just by
applying<00:03:45.989> a<00:03:46.290> little<00:03:46.319> bit<00:03:46.530> more<00:03:46.680> glaze<00:03:48.829> going

00:03:49.819 --> 00:03:49.829 
applying a little bit more glaze going

00:03:49.829 --> 00:03:52.009 
applying a little bit more glaze going
back<00:03:50.069> with<00:03:50.280> the<00:03:50.370> cheesecloth<00:03:50.910> and<00:03:51.359> then

00:03:52.009 --> 00:03:52.019 
back with the cheesecloth and then

00:03:52.019 --> 00:03:54.680 
back with the cheesecloth and then
finally<00:03:52.739> just<00:03:52.980> a<00:03:53.310> little<00:03:53.579> bit<00:03:53.669> of<00:03:53.790> sponge<00:03:54.180> so

00:03:54.680 --> 00:03:54.690 
finally just a little bit of sponge so

00:03:54.690 --> 00:03:56.839 
finally just a little bit of sponge so
it's<00:03:55.440> very<00:03:55.560> easy<00:03:55.829> to<00:03:55.950> repair<00:03:56.430> this<00:03:56.579> while

00:03:56.839 --> 00:03:56.849 
it's very easy to repair this while

00:03:56.849 --> 00:03:59.539 
it's very easy to repair this while
you're<00:03:57.030> working<00:03:57.209> on<00:03:57.540> it<00:03:57.750> and<00:03:58.099> that<00:03:59.099> is<00:03:59.340> the

00:03:59.539 --> 00:03:59.549 
you're working on it and that is the

00:03:59.549 --> 00:04:03.950 
you're working on it and that is the
Provos<00:04:00.120> and<00:04:00.510> stone<00:04:00.780> fresco<00:04:01.500> finish
