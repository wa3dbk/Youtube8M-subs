00:02:39.820 --> 00:02:39.830 
about it but actually by looking at this

00:02:39.830 --> 00:02:41.080 
about it but actually by looking at this
one<00:02:40.040> I<00:02:40.190> thought<00:02:40.489> this<00:02:40.610> was<00:02:40.790> a<00:02:40.819> little<00:02:41.030> bit

00:02:41.080 --> 00:02:41.090 
one I thought this was a little bit

00:02:41.090 --> 00:02:42.490 
one I thought this was a little bit
different<00:02:41.330> than<00:02:41.600> the<00:02:41.690> standard<00:02:41.840> soft<00:02:42.260> round

00:02:42.490 --> 00:02:42.500 
different than the standard soft round

00:02:42.500 --> 00:02:44.229 
different than the standard soft round
pro<00:02:42.650> stun<00:02:42.860> patterns<00:02:43.220> but<00:02:43.700> it's<00:02:43.849> actually<00:02:44.120> not

00:02:44.229 --> 00:02:44.239 
pro stun patterns but it's actually not

00:02:44.239 --> 00:02:45.910 
pro stun patterns but it's actually not
I<00:02:44.300> grabbed<00:02:44.599> the<00:02:44.810> legend<00:02:45.319> here<00:02:45.470> just<00:02:45.680> to<00:02:45.769> show

00:02:45.910 --> 00:02:45.920 
I grabbed the legend here just to show

00:02:45.920 --> 00:02:47.440 
I grabbed the legend here just to show
you<00:02:46.010> guys<00:02:46.069> a<00:02:46.160> comparison<00:02:46.760> they're<00:02:47.269> pretty

00:02:47.440 --> 00:02:47.450 
you guys a comparison they're pretty

00:02:47.450 --> 00:02:49.840 
you guys a comparison they're pretty
much<00:02:47.569> identical<00:02:47.720> you<00:02:48.410> have<00:02:48.590> all<00:02:49.100> the<00:02:49.670> same

00:02:49.840 --> 00:02:49.850 
much identical you have all the same

00:02:49.850 --> 00:02:51.670 
much identical you have all the same
stud<00:02:50.120> placements<00:02:50.660> on<00:02:50.810> both<00:02:51.170> of<00:02:51.350> these<00:02:51.440> shoes

00:02:51.670 --> 00:02:51.680 
stud placements on both of these shoes

00:02:51.680 --> 00:02:54.640 
stud placements on both of these shoes
which<00:02:51.860> is<00:02:52.010> pretty<00:02:52.880> funny<00:02:53.120> I<00:02:53.209> thought<00:02:53.560> so<00:02:54.560> you

00:02:54.640 --> 00:02:54.650 
which is pretty funny I thought so you

obviously<00:02:54.739> have<00:02:55.100> the<00:02:55.250> two<00:02:55.400> metal<00:02:56.239> studs<00:02:56.450> in

00:02:56.559 --> 00:02:56.569 
obviously have the two metal studs in

00:02:56.569 --> 00:02:58.090 
obviously have the two metal studs in
the<00:02:56.630> heel<00:02:56.810> here<00:02:57.080> and<00:02:57.530> of<00:02:57.620> course<00:02:57.830> the<00:02:57.950> to

00:02:58.090 --> 00:02:58.100 
the heel here and of course the to

00:02:58.100 --> 00:03:00.340 
the heel here and of course the to
support<00:02:58.489> studs<00:02:58.730> as<00:02:58.910> plastic<00:02:59.450> ones<00:02:59.660> you<00:03:00.230> have

00:03:00.340 --> 00:03:00.350 
support studs as plastic ones you have

00:03:00.350 --> 00:03:01.930

then<00:03:04.100> of<00:03:04.190> course<00:03:04.250> a<00:03:04.549> kind<00:03:04.880> of<00:03:05.590> stud<00:03:06.590> in<00:03:06.709> the

00:03:06.759 --> 00:03:06.769 
then of course a kind of stud in the

00:03:06.769 --> 00:03:08.050 
then of course a kind of stud in the
middle<00:03:07.010> here<00:03:07.160> as<00:03:07.280> a<00:03:07.310> blade<00:03:07.549> kind<00:03:07.790> of<00:03:07.850> as<00:03:07.940> a

00:03:08.050 --> 00:03:08.060 
middle here as a blade kind of as a

00:03:08.060 --> 00:03:09.970 
middle here as a blade kind of as a
support<00:03:08.420> stud<00:03:08.660> you<00:03:09.080> have<00:03:09.200> this<00:03:09.290> extra<00:03:09.739> stud

00:03:09.970 --> 00:03:09.980 
support stud you have this extra stud

00:03:09.980 --> 00:03:12.100 
support stud you have this extra stud
here<00:03:10.190> right<00:03:10.430> in<00:03:10.610> between<00:03:10.790> the<00:03:11.660> two<00:03:11.690> on<00:03:12.019> the

00:03:12.100 --> 00:03:12.110 
here right in between the two on the

00:03:12.110 --> 00:03:13.539 
here right in between the two on the
outside<00:03:12.470> then<00:03:12.769> you<00:03:12.860> have<00:03:12.980> your<00:03:13.100> two<00:03:13.280> metal

00:03:13.539 --> 00:03:13.549 
outside then you have your two metal

00:03:13.549 --> 00:03:15.070 
outside then you have your two metal
studs<00:03:13.760> here<00:03:14.030> then<00:03:14.480> you<00:03:14.600> have<00:03:14.630> this<00:03:14.840> kind<00:03:15.049> of

00:03:15.070 --> 00:03:15.080 
studs here then you have this kind of

00:03:15.080 --> 00:03:16.449 
studs here then you have this kind of
push<00:03:15.290> off<00:03:15.500> study<00:03:15.769> and<00:03:15.950> clear<00:03:16.160> I<00:03:16.190> don't<00:03:16.400> know

00:03:16.449 --> 00:03:16.459 
push off study and clear I don't know

00:03:16.459 --> 00:03:18.310 
push off study and clear I don't know
how<00:03:16.580> great<00:03:16.790> you<00:03:16.880> guys<00:03:17.000> can<00:03:17.209> see<00:03:17.359> that<00:03:17.390> but<00:03:18.230> it

00:03:18.310 --> 00:03:18.320 
how great you guys can see that but it

00:03:18.320 --> 00:03:20.380 
how great you guys can see that but it
is<00:03:18.350> they're<00:03:18.650> not<00:03:18.680> you<00:03:18.950> can<00:03:19.010> see<00:03:19.280> it<00:03:19.390> well

00:03:20.380 --> 00:03:20.390 
is they're not you can see it well

00:03:20.390 --> 00:03:22.690 
is they're not you can see it well
that's<00:03:20.510> pretty<00:03:20.630> much<00:03:20.810> it<00:03:20.989> as<00:03:21.079> far<00:03:21.109> as<00:03:21.410> the<00:03:21.700> stud

00:03:22.690 --> 00:03:22.700 
that's pretty much it as far as the stud

00:03:22.700 --> 00:03:23.949 
that's pretty much it as far as the stud
pattern<00:03:22.850> the<00:03:23.209> soft<00:03:23.420> ground<00:03:23.570> prototype

00:03:23.949 --> 00:03:23.959 
pattern the soft ground prototype

00:03:23.959 --> 00:03:26.229 
pattern the soft ground prototype
pattern<00:03:24.230> goes<00:03:24.380> it's<00:03:24.890> still<00:03:25.100> soft<00:03:25.310> ground<00:03:25.549> stud

00:03:26.229 --> 00:03:26.239 
pattern goes it's still soft ground stud

00:03:26.239 --> 00:03:27.660 
pattern goes it's still soft ground stud
pattern<00:03:26.510> but<00:03:26.630> there's<00:03:26.690> a<00:03:26.810> little<00:03:26.930> bit<00:03:27.019> extra

00:03:27.660 --> 00:03:27.670 
pattern but there's a little bit extra

00:03:27.670 --> 00:03:29.830 
pattern but there's a little bit extra
rather<00:03:28.670> than<00:03:28.940> just<00:03:29.120> having<00:03:29.390> your<00:03:29.480> standard

00:03:29.830 --> 00:03:29.840 
rather than just having your standard

00:03:29.840 --> 00:03:31.090 
rather than just having your standard
six<00:03:30.049> side<00:03:30.200> you<00:03:30.320> get<00:03:30.440> these<00:03:30.530> extra<00:03:30.890> plastic

00:03:31.090 --> 00:03:31.100 
six side you get these extra plastic

00:03:31.100 --> 00:03:32.949 
six side you get these extra plastic
studs<00:03:31.519> in<00:03:31.640> between<00:03:31.970> which<00:03:32.510> i<00:03:32.630> think<00:03:32.690> is<00:03:32.930> a

00:03:32.949 --> 00:03:32.959 
studs in between which i think is a

00:03:32.959 --> 00:03:34.270 
studs in between which i think is a
little<00:03:33.049> bit<00:03:33.260> better<00:03:33.350> I'd<00:03:33.620> personally<00:03:33.920> like

00:03:34.270 --> 00:03:34.280 
little bit better I'd personally like

00:03:34.280 --> 00:03:36.280 
little bit better I'd personally like
having<00:03:34.640> that<00:03:34.760> kind<00:03:34.970> of<00:03:35.000> thing<00:03:35.209> and<00:03:36.200> that's

00:03:36.280 --> 00:03:36.290 
having that kind of thing and that's

00:03:36.290 --> 00:03:37.750 
having that kind of thing and that's
just<00:03:36.440> a<00:03:36.650> little<00:03:36.950> bit<00:03:37.040> more<00:03:37.220> grip<00:03:37.430> than<00:03:37.670> you

00:03:37.750 --> 00:03:37.760 
just a little bit more grip than you

00:03:37.760 --> 00:03:39.880 
just a little bit more grip than you
would<00:03:37.850> normally<00:03:38.180> get<00:03:38.359> and<00:03:38.630> overall<00:03:39.590> I<00:03:39.620> think

00:03:39.880 --> 00:03:39.890 
would normally get and overall I think

00:03:39.890 --> 00:03:40.960 
would normally get and overall I think
it's<00:03:40.010> cool<00:03:40.190> thing<00:03:40.430> to<00:03:40.519> have<00:03:40.670> and<00:03:40.880> something

00:03:40.960 --> 00:03:40.970 
it's cool thing to have and something

00:03:40.970 --> 00:03:42.460 
it's cool thing to have and something
that<00:03:41.239> it's<00:03:41.390> nice<00:03:41.600> that<00:03:41.810> they<00:03:41.900> did<00:03:42.079> include

00:03:42.460 --> 00:03:42.470 
that it's nice that they did include

00:03:42.470 --> 00:03:44.020 
that it's nice that they did include
what's<00:03:43.310> a<00:03:43.340> little<00:03:43.430> bit<00:03:43.579> different<00:03:43.820> about<00:03:43.880> the

00:03:44.020 --> 00:03:44.030 
what's a little bit different about the

00:03:44.030 --> 00:03:45.789 
what's a little bit different about the
particular<00:03:44.299> soleplate<00:03:44.720> on<00:03:45.019> the<00:03:45.200> soft<00:03:45.440> compro

00:03:45.789 --> 00:03:45.799 
particular soleplate on the soft compro

00:03:45.799 --> 00:03:47.560 
particular soleplate on the soft compro
version<00:03:46.160> of<00:03:46.280> the<00:03:46.400> vapor<00:03:46.549> is<00:03:46.850> that<00:03:47.359> you<00:03:47.420> have

00:03:47.560 --> 00:03:47.570 
version of the vapor is that you have

00:03:47.570 --> 00:03:49.750 
version of the vapor is that you have
this<00:03:47.660> glass<00:03:47.900> fiber<00:03:48.200> soleplate<00:03:48.650> still<00:03:49.010> but<00:03:49.579> as

00:03:49.750 --> 00:03:49.760 
this glass fiber soleplate still but as

00:03:49.760 --> 00:03:53.289 
this glass fiber soleplate still but as
opposed<00:03:50.209> to<00:03:50.359> having<00:03:50.540> the<00:03:50.810> dual<00:03:51.019> layer<00:03:52.209> kind<00:03:53.209> of

00:03:53.289 --> 00:03:53.299 
opposed to having the dual layer kind of

00:03:53.299 --> 00:03:55.030 
opposed to having the dual layer kind of
running<00:03:53.600> through<00:03:53.780> the<00:03:53.870> soleplate<00:03:54.049> where<00:03:54.859> it

00:03:55.030 --> 00:03:55.040 
running through the soleplate where it

00:03:55.040 --> 00:03:56.650 
running through the soleplate where it
was<00:03:55.130> only<00:03:55.310> two<00:03:55.519> layers<00:03:55.760> from<00:03:56.000> the<00:03:56.090> heel<00:03:56.420> to

00:03:56.650 --> 00:03:56.660 
was only two layers from the heel to

00:03:56.660 --> 00:03:58.330 
was only two layers from the heel to
about<00:03:56.810> the<00:03:56.930> forefoot<00:03:57.290> area<00:03:57.590> right<00:03:57.829> here<00:03:58.160> and

00:03:58.330 --> 00:03:58.340 
about the forefoot area right here and

00:03:58.340 --> 00:03:59.830 
about the forefoot area right here and
then<00:03:58.700> I<00:03:58.730> went<00:03:58.880> to<00:03:58.940> a<00:03:59.030> single<00:03:59.420> layer<00:03:59.600> where<00:03:59.810> you

00:03:59.830 --> 00:03:59.840 
then I went to a single layer where you

00:03:59.840 --> 00:04:01.059 
then I went to a single layer where you
could<00:04:00.049> see<00:04:00.170> that<00:04:00.290> the<00:04:00.410> color<00:04:00.620> kind<00:04:00.829> of<00:04:00.920> got<00:04:01.040> a

00:04:01.059 --> 00:04:01.069 
could see that the color kind of got a

00:04:01.069 --> 00:04:02.590 
could see that the color kind of got a
little<00:04:01.280> bit<00:04:01.400> lighter<00:04:01.549> this<00:04:02.090> one<00:04:02.329> use<00:04:02.450> this

00:04:02.590 --> 00:04:02.600 
little bit lighter this one use this

00:04:02.600 --> 00:04:04.569 
little bit lighter this one use this
double<00:04:03.109> layer<00:04:03.230> all<00:04:03.500> the<00:04:03.530> way<00:04:03.680> through<00:04:03.980> simply

00:04:04.569 --> 00:04:04.579 
double layer all the way through simply

00:04:04.579 --> 00:04:06.069 
double layer all the way through simply
because<00:04:04.850> these<00:04:05.060> metal<00:04:05.450> studs<00:04:05.720> require<00:04:06.049> a

00:04:06.069 --> 00:04:06.079 
because these metal studs require a

00:04:06.079 --> 00:04:07.930 
because these metal studs require a
little<00:04:06.260> bit<00:04:06.410> more<00:04:06.560> kind<00:04:06.950> of<00:04:07.040> stiffness<00:04:07.670> you

00:04:07.930 --> 00:04:07.940 
little bit more kind of stiffness you

00:04:07.940 --> 00:04:09.129 
little bit more kind of stiffness you
can<00:04:08.090> tell<00:04:08.239> if<00:04:08.329> the<00:04:08.420> soleplate<00:04:08.630> is<00:04:08.810> a<00:04:08.959> little

00:04:09.129 --> 00:04:09.139 
can tell if the soleplate is a little

00:04:09.139 --> 00:04:11.140 
can tell if the soleplate is a little
bit<00:04:09.230> more<00:04:09.380> rigid<00:04:09.590> in<00:04:09.889> the<00:04:10.040> forefoot<00:04:10.370> area<00:04:10.639> it's

00:04:11.140 --> 00:04:11.150 
bit more rigid in the forefoot area it's

00:04:11.150 --> 00:04:12.610 
bit more rigid in the forefoot area it's
definitely<00:04:11.630> not<00:04:11.780> as<00:04:11.930> flexible<00:04:12.380> from<00:04:12.530> right

00:04:12.610 --> 00:04:12.620 
definitely not as flexible from right

00:04:12.620 --> 00:04:14.349 
definitely not as flexible from right
out-of-the-box<00:04:12.799> so<00:04:13.670> interesting<00:04:14.090> to<00:04:14.180> use

00:04:14.349 --> 00:04:14.359 
out-of-the-box so interesting to use

00:04:14.359 --> 00:04:15.849 
out-of-the-box so interesting to use
this<00:04:14.480> particular<00:04:14.690> soleplate<00:04:15.260> and<00:04:15.530> see<00:04:15.680> if<00:04:15.769> I

00:04:15.849 --> 00:04:15.859 
this particular soleplate and see if I

00:04:15.859 --> 00:04:16.930 
this particular soleplate and see if I
can<00:04:16.010> tell<00:04:16.100> the<00:04:16.220> difference<00:04:16.489> in<00:04:16.609> terms<00:04:16.789> of

00:04:16.930 --> 00:04:16.940 
can tell the difference in terms of

00:04:16.940 --> 00:04:18.000 
can tell the difference in terms of
flexibility

00:04:18.000 --> 00:04:18.010 
flexibility

00:04:18.010 --> 00:04:20.650 
flexibility
overall<00:04:19.010> in<00:04:19.250> the<00:04:19.340> entire<00:04:19.639> soleplate<00:04:20.150> itself

00:04:20.650 --> 00:04:20.660 
overall in the entire soleplate itself

00:04:20.660 --> 00:04:22.450 
overall in the entire soleplate itself
but<00:04:21.229> other<00:04:21.590> than<00:04:21.799> that<00:04:21.950> there's<00:04:22.159> really<00:04:22.280> not

00:04:22.450 --> 00:04:22.460 
but other than that there's really not

00:04:22.460 --> 00:04:23.830 
but other than that there's really not
much<00:04:22.610> difference<00:04:22.669> as<00:04:23.150> far<00:04:23.180> as<00:04:23.360> the<00:04:23.450> shoe<00:04:23.659> goes

00:04:23.830 --> 00:04:23.840 
much difference as far as the shoe goes

00:04:23.840 --> 00:04:25.180 
much difference as far as the shoe goes
it<00:04:24.289> does<00:04:24.530> weigh<00:04:24.710> a<00:04:24.740> little<00:04:24.950> bit<00:04:25.039> more

00:04:25.180 --> 00:04:25.190 
it does weigh a little bit more

00:04:25.190 --> 00:04:26.500 
it does weigh a little bit more
obviously<00:04:25.490> because<00:04:25.700> you<00:04:25.820> have<00:04:25.940> the

00:04:26.500 --> 00:04:26.510 
obviously because you have the

00:04:26.510 --> 00:04:28.990 
obviously because you have the
as<00:04:27.050> opposed<00:04:27.350> to<00:04:27.440> the<00:04:27.620> plastic<00:04:28.010> ones<00:04:28.190> which<00:04:28.820> are

00:04:28.990 --> 00:04:29.000

as opposed to the plastic ones which are
significantly<00:04:29.630> lighter<00:04:29.930> and<00:04:30.770> then<00:04:31.070> like<00:04:31.220> I

00:04:31.330 --> 00:04:31.340 
significantly lighter and then like I

00:04:31.340 --> 00:04:33.160 
significantly lighter and then like I
said<00:04:31.520> you<00:04:31.640> have<00:04:31.670> the<00:04:31.880> 11<00:04:32.210> millimeter<00:04:32.630> studs<00:04:32.960> on
