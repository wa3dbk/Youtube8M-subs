justice<00:02:29.370> but<00:02:29.880> these<00:02:30.120> pigments<00:02:30.870> are<00:02:31.170> actually

00:02:31.580 --> 00:02:31.590 
justice but these pigments are actually

00:02:31.590 --> 00:02:33.230 
justice but these pigments are actually
a<00:02:31.800> lot<00:02:32.070> better<00:02:32.280> applying<00:02:32.700> them<00:02:32.850> on<00:02:32.970> with<00:02:33.090> your

finger<00:02:33.510> is<00:02:33.630> my<00:02:33.870> personal<00:02:34.290> opinion<00:02:34.410> and<00:02:34.830> it

00:02:34.940 --> 00:02:34.950 
finger is my personal opinion and it

00:02:34.950 --> 00:02:36.530 
finger is my personal opinion and it
gives<00:02:35.070> a<00:02:35.100> little<00:02:35.280> pop<00:02:35.520> to<00:02:35.940> our<00:02:36.030> shadow<00:02:36.270> and

00:02:36.530 --> 00:02:36.540 
gives a little pop to our shadow and

00:02:36.540 --> 00:02:38.720 
gives a little pop to our shadow and
