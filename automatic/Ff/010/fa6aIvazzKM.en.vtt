hi<00:00:07.139> I'm<00:00:07.319> Chris<00:00:07.559> Murray<00:00:07.589> and<00:00:07.919> welcome<00:00:08.129> to<00:00:08.460> this

00:00:08.570 --> 00:00:08.580 
hi I'm Chris Murray and welcome to this

00:00:08.580 --> 00:00:10.190 
hi I'm Chris Murray and welcome to this
quick<00:00:08.820> look<00:00:09.030> on<00:00:09.180> 3dsmax

00:00:10.190 --> 00:00:10.200 
quick look on 3dsmax

00:00:10.200 --> 00:00:12.920 
quick look on 3dsmax
I<00:00:10.320> got<00:00:10.920> this<00:00:11.039> question<00:00:11.580> a<00:00:11.969> while<00:00:12.269> back<00:00:12.600> from

00:00:12.920 --> 00:00:12.930 
I got this question a while back from

00:00:12.930 --> 00:00:15.140 
I got this question a while back from
someone<00:00:13.350> about<00:00:13.379> splines<00:00:14.160> and<00:00:14.520> I<00:00:14.609> wanted<00:00:14.939> to

00:00:15.140 --> 00:00:15.150 
someone about splines and I wanted to

00:00:15.150 --> 00:00:16.880 
someone about splines and I wanted to
cover<00:00:15.689> it<00:00:15.840> here<00:00:16.049> because<00:00:16.170> it's<00:00:16.470> I<00:00:16.560> think<00:00:16.619> it's

00:00:16.880 --> 00:00:16.890 
cover it here because it's I think it's

00:00:16.890 --> 00:00:18.429 
cover it here because it's I think it's
a<00:00:16.949> pretty<00:00:17.130> common<00:00:17.400> misconception<00:00:18.269> about

00:00:18.429 --> 00:00:18.439 
a pretty common misconception about

00:00:18.439 --> 00:00:21.650 
a pretty common misconception about
splines<00:00:19.439> and<00:00:19.680> spline<00:00:19.949> vertices<00:00:20.460> and<00:00:20.789> how<00:00:21.480> they

00:00:21.650 --> 00:00:21.660 
splines and spline vertices and how they

00:00:21.660 --> 00:00:23.960 
splines and spline vertices and how they
work<00:00:21.960> I'm<00:00:22.499> gonna<00:00:22.740> create<00:00:23.130> a<00:00:23.490> two-dimensional

00:00:23.960 --> 00:00:23.970 
work I'm gonna create a two-dimensional

00:00:23.970 --> 00:00:26.810 
work I'm gonna create a two-dimensional
spline<00:00:24.720> here<00:00:25.140> in<00:00:25.349> my<00:00:25.560> Mac<00:00:25.800> scene<00:00:26.159> and<00:00:26.429> if<00:00:26.519> I<00:00:26.669> are

00:00:26.810 --> 00:00:26.820 
spline here in my Mac scene and if I are

00:00:26.820 --> 00:00:27.890 
spline here in my Mac scene and if I are
rotated<00:00:27.269> round<00:00:27.419> you<00:00:27.509> can<00:00:27.570> see<00:00:27.749> it's

00:00:27.890 --> 00:00:27.900 
rotated round you can see it's

00:00:27.900 --> 00:00:30.529 
rotated round you can see it's
definitely<00:00:28.289> a<00:00:28.320> spline<00:00:28.679> there<00:00:29.009> and<00:00:29.400> I'm<00:00:30.179> going

00:00:30.529 --> 00:00:30.539 
definitely a spline there and I'm going

00:00:30.539 --> 00:00:34.250 
definitely a spline there and I'm going
to<00:00:30.890> make<00:00:31.890> a<00:00:32.099> copy<00:00:32.910> of<00:00:33.239> it<00:00:33.390> because<00:00:33.810> what<00:00:33.989> I<00:00:34.020> want

00:00:34.250 --> 00:00:34.260 
to make a copy of it because what I want

00:00:34.260 --> 00:00:37.220 
to make a copy of it because what I want
to<00:00:34.440> do<00:00:34.649> is<00:00:35.060> possibly<00:00:36.060> use<00:00:36.239> the<00:00:36.750> surface

00:00:37.220 --> 00:00:37.230 
to do is possibly use the surface

00:00:37.230 --> 00:00:40.100 
to do is possibly use the surface
modifier<00:00:37.710> or<00:00:38.010> maybe<00:00:38.850> just<00:00:39.120> some<00:00:39.240> other<00:00:39.390> sort

00:00:40.100 --> 00:00:40.110 
modifier or maybe just some other sort

00:00:40.110 --> 00:00:42.620 
modifier or maybe just some other sort
of<00:00:40.200> a<00:00:40.260> spline<00:00:40.740> cage<00:00:41.040> construction<00:00:41.820> so<00:00:42.510> I'm

00:00:42.620 --> 00:00:42.630 
of a spline cage construction so I'm

00:00:42.630 --> 00:00:44.150 
of a spline cage construction so I'm
going<00:00:42.780> to<00:00:42.840> go<00:00:42.930> ahead<00:00:43.050> and<00:00:43.260> convert<00:00:43.470> this<00:00:43.830> to<00:00:44.040> an

00:00:44.150 --> 00:00:44.160 
going to go ahead and convert this to an

00:00:44.160 --> 00:00:45.800 
going to go ahead and convert this to an
editable<00:00:44.250> spline<00:00:44.640> and<00:00:45.120> it's<00:00:45.270> basically<00:00:45.690> just

00:00:45.800 --> 00:00:45.810 
editable spline and it's basically just

00:00:45.810 --> 00:00:48.530 
editable spline and it's basically just
a<00:00:46.080> spline<00:00:46.380> now<00:00:46.620> I'm<00:00:47.190> gonna<00:00:47.430> copy<00:00:47.700> I'm<00:00:48.390> gonna

00:00:48.530 --> 00:00:48.540 
a spline now I'm gonna copy I'm gonna

00:00:48.540 --> 00:00:50.330 
a spline now I'm gonna copy I'm gonna
select<00:00:48.810> the<00:00:49.170> spline<00:00:49.590> at<00:00:49.920> the<00:00:50.010> sub<00:00:50.190> object

00:00:50.330 --> 00:00:50.340 
select the spline at the sub object

00:00:50.340 --> 00:00:53.480 
select the spline at the sub object
level<00:00:50.760> and<00:00:51.090> I'm<00:00:51.300> going<00:00:51.630> to<00:00:51.840> copy<00:00:52.770> it<00:00:52.980> up<00:00:53.310> now

00:00:53.480 --> 00:00:53.490 
level and I'm going to copy it up now

00:00:53.490 --> 00:00:55.340 
level and I'm going to copy it up now
what<00:00:53.670> this<00:00:53.850> does<00:00:54.060> is<00:00:54.300> this<00:00:54.420> makes<00:00:54.630> a<00:00:54.750> duplicate

00:00:55.340 --> 00:00:55.350 
what this does is this makes a duplicate

00:00:55.350 --> 00:00:58.970 
what this does is this makes a duplicate
of<00:00:55.820> this<00:00:56.820> shape<00:00:57.270> but<00:00:57.630> it's<00:00:57.840> still<00:00:58.260> one<00:00:58.500> object

00:00:58.970 --> 00:00:58.980 
of this shape but it's still one object

00:00:58.980 --> 00:01:00.410 
of this shape but it's still one object
you<00:00:59.070> can<00:00:59.250> notice<00:00:59.490> that<00:00:59.640> because<00:00:59.940> the<00:01:00.090> bounding

00:01:00.410 --> 00:01:00.420 
you can notice that because the bounding

00:01:00.420 --> 00:01:03.140 
you can notice that because the bounding
box<00:01:00.450> is<00:01:00.840> and<00:01:01.200> this<00:01:01.290> is<00:01:01.500> important<00:01:02.040> I'm<00:01:02.910> now

00:01:03.140 --> 00:01:03.150 
box is and this is important I'm now

00:01:03.150 --> 00:01:06.109 
box is and this is important I'm now
going<00:01:03.630> to<00:01:03.810> use<00:01:04.110> the<00:01:04.769> cross<00:01:05.070> section<00:01:05.549> modifier

00:01:06.109 --> 00:01:06.119 
going to use the cross section modifier

00:01:06.119 --> 00:01:09.080 
going to use the cross section modifier
to<00:01:06.990> connect<00:01:07.619> all<00:01:07.799> of<00:01:07.829> those<00:01:08.100> points<00:01:08.580> now<00:01:08.820> of

00:01:09.080 --> 00:01:09.090 
to connect all of those points now of

00:01:09.090 --> 00:01:10.940 
to connect all of those points now of
course<00:01:09.480> this<00:01:09.810> looks<00:01:10.020> like<00:01:10.200> a<00:01:10.230> box<00:01:10.470> but<00:01:10.770> that's

00:01:10.940 --> 00:01:10.950 
course this looks like a box but that's

00:01:10.950 --> 00:01:12.230 
course this looks like a box but that's
not<00:01:11.130> really<00:01:11.370> what<00:01:11.490> this<00:01:11.640> is<00:01:11.790> about<00:01:12.060> I'm

00:01:12.230 --> 00:01:12.240 
not really what this is about I'm

00:01:12.240 --> 00:01:15.110 
not really what this is about I'm
talking<00:01:12.420> about<00:01:12.720> vertex<00:01:13.620> behavior<00:01:14.130> within<00:01:14.880> a

00:01:15.110 --> 00:01:15.120 
talking about vertex behavior within a

00:01:15.120 --> 00:01:18.080 
talking about vertex behavior within a
spline<00:01:15.390> so<00:01:15.720> if<00:01:16.230> I<00:01:16.380> go<00:01:16.590> in<00:01:16.800> here<00:01:17.130> and<00:01:17.370> I'm<00:01:17.970> gonna

00:01:18.080 --> 00:01:18.090 
spline so if I go in here and I'm gonna

00:01:18.090 --> 00:01:19.880 
spline so if I go in here and I'm gonna
right-click<00:01:18.960> and<00:01:19.440> I'm<00:01:19.530> just<00:01:19.710> going<00:01:19.860> to

00:01:19.880 --> 00:01:19.890 
right-click and I'm just going to

00:01:19.890 --> 00:01:21.770 
right-click and I'm just going to
convert<00:01:20.340> this<00:01:20.490> all<00:01:20.700> to<00:01:21.090> an<00:01:21.240> editable<00:01:21.630> spline

00:01:21.770 --> 00:01:21.780 
convert this all to an editable spline

00:01:21.780 --> 00:01:24.530 
convert this all to an editable spline
so<00:01:22.290> this<00:01:22.500> is<00:01:22.710> still<00:01:23.010> a<00:01:23.040> spline<00:01:23.610> object<00:01:23.970> even

00:01:24.530 --> 00:01:24.540 
so this is still a spline object even

00:01:24.540 --> 00:01:26.719 
so this is still a spline object even
though<00:01:24.690> it<00:01:24.900> appears<00:01:25.200> to<00:01:25.320> be<00:01:25.409> 3-dimensional<00:01:26.190> if

00:01:26.719 --> 00:01:26.729 
though it appears to be 3-dimensional if

00:01:26.729 --> 00:01:29.990 
though it appears to be 3-dimensional if
I<00:01:26.940> go<00:01:27.150> in<00:01:27.390> and<00:01:27.630> select<00:01:28.050> a<00:01:28.260> vertex<00:01:28.710> you<00:01:29.130> can<00:01:29.550> see

00:01:29.990 --> 00:01:30.000 
I go in and select a vertex you can see

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:31.969 
I go in and select a vertex you can see
that<00:01:30.300> I've<00:01:30.450> got<00:01:30.570> a<00:01:30.630> spline<00:01:31.020> vertex<00:01:31.560> and<00:01:31.800> if<00:01:31.860> I

00:01:31.969 --> 00:01:31.979 
that I've got a spline vertex and if I

00:01:31.979 --> 00:01:33.410 
that I've got a spline vertex and if I
right<00:01:32.220> click<00:01:32.250> on<00:01:32.610> it<00:01:32.729> you<00:01:32.790> can<00:01:32.850> see<00:01:33.150> that<00:01:33.299> it's

00:01:33.410 --> 00:01:33.420 
right click on it you can see that it's

00:01:33.420 --> 00:01:35.600 
right click on it you can see that it's
a<00:01:33.510> corner<00:01:33.840> vertex<00:01:34.229> so<00:01:34.470> if<00:01:34.979> I<00:01:35.130> change<00:01:35.370> it<00:01:35.580> to

00:01:35.600 --> 00:01:35.610 
a corner vertex so if I change it to

00:01:35.610 --> 00:01:37.700 
a corner vertex so if I change it to
smooth<00:01:36.030> it's<00:01:37.020> actually<00:01:37.440> it's<00:01:37.530> kind<00:01:37.680> of

00:01:37.700 --> 00:01:37.710 
smooth it's actually it's kind of

00:01:37.710 --> 00:01:39.430 
smooth it's actually it's kind of
important<00:01:38.100> to<00:01:38.130> know<00:01:38.250> which<00:01:38.460> vertex<00:01:38.880> you're

00:01:39.430 --> 00:01:39.440 
important to know which vertex you're

00:01:39.440 --> 00:01:41.480 
important to know which vertex you're
dealing<00:01:40.440> with<00:01:40.560> if<00:01:40.740> I<00:01:40.830> just<00:01:41.070> kind<00:01:41.220> of<00:01:41.280> peel

00:01:41.480 --> 00:01:41.490 
dealing with if I just kind of peel

00:01:41.490 --> 00:01:43.039 
dealing with if I just kind of peel
these<00:01:41.640> off<00:01:41.820> actually<00:01:42.299> what<00:01:42.450> I'm<00:01:42.540> gonna<00:01:42.630> do<00:01:42.900> is

00:01:43.039 --> 00:01:43.049 
these off actually what I'm gonna do is

00:01:43.049 --> 00:01:44.539 
these off actually what I'm gonna do is
go<00:01:43.200> into<00:01:43.350> this<00:01:43.470> segment<00:01:43.950> and<00:01:44.070> move<00:01:44.280> it<00:01:44.400> out

00:01:44.539 --> 00:01:44.549 
go into this segment and move it out

00:01:44.549 --> 00:01:46.280 
go into this segment and move it out
just<00:01:44.940> for<00:01:45.150> the<00:01:45.240> for<00:01:45.510> the<00:01:45.600> purposes<00:01:46.020> of<00:01:46.080> this

00:01:46.280 --> 00:01:46.290 
just for the for the purposes of this

00:01:46.290 --> 00:01:50.840 
just for the for the purposes of this
discussion<00:01:46.820> if<00:01:47.820> I<00:01:48.030> select<00:01:48.420> this<00:01:49.610> go<00:01:50.610> back<00:01:50.760> to

00:01:50.840 --> 00:01:50.850 
discussion if I select this go back to

vertex<00:01:51.180> mode<00:01:51.450> if<00:01:51.630> I<00:01:51.720> select<00:01:52.140> this<00:01:52.440> vertex<00:01:52.680> here

00:01:53.120 --> 00:01:53.130 
vertex mode if I select this vertex here

00:01:53.130 --> 00:01:56.630 
vertex mode if I select this vertex here
you<00:01:53.310> can<00:01:53.490> see<00:01:53.729> that<00:01:54.479> it<00:01:55.229> is<00:01:55.290> Bezier<00:01:55.950> corner<00:01:56.250> and

00:01:56.630 --> 00:01:56.640 
you can see that it is Bezier corner and

00:01:56.640 --> 00:01:58.430 
you can see that it is Bezier corner and
here<00:01:57.000> indeed<00:01:57.270> are<00:01:57.390> the<00:01:57.420> Bezier<00:01:57.780> handle<00:01:58.260> so

00:01:58.430 --> 00:01:58.440 
here indeed are the Bezier handle so

00:01:58.440 --> 00:02:00.740 
here indeed are the Bezier handle so
that<00:01:58.650> if<00:01:58.740> I<00:01:58.890> want<00:01:59.070> to<00:01:59.340> move<00:02:00.060> these<00:02:00.210> handles

00:02:00.740 --> 00:02:00.750 
that if I want to move these handles

00:02:00.750 --> 00:02:02.179 
that if I want to move these handles
around<00:02:00.990> you<00:02:01.200> can<00:02:01.350> see<00:02:01.500> I<00:02:01.530> can<00:02:01.770> still<00:02:01.950> get<00:02:02.070> the

00:02:02.179 --> 00:02:02.189 
around you can see I can still get the

00:02:02.189 --> 00:02:04.730 
around you can see I can still get the
curvature<00:02:02.670> or<00:02:02.850> if<00:02:03.570> I<00:02:03.720> change<00:02:04.080> it<00:02:04.260> to<00:02:04.439> smooth

00:02:04.730 --> 00:02:04.740 
curvature or if I change it to smooth

00:02:04.740 --> 00:02:09.020 
curvature or if I change it to smooth
it'll<00:02:05.580> smooth<00:02:06.510> that<00:02:06.750> out<00:02:07.189> whatever<00:02:08.189> based<00:02:08.849> on

00:02:09.020 --> 00:02:09.030 
it'll smooth that out whatever based on

00:02:09.030 --> 00:02:11.149 
it'll smooth that out whatever based on
the<00:02:09.119> interpreter<00:02:09.929> palatial<00:02:10.349> now<00:02:10.590> the

the interpreter palatial now the

00:02:11.159 --> 00:02:12.800 
the interpreter palatial now the
question<00:02:11.549> that<00:02:11.670> I<00:02:11.730> had<00:02:11.970> received<00:02:12.150> was<00:02:12.630> why

00:02:12.800 --> 00:02:12.810 
question that I had received was why

00:02:12.810 --> 00:02:14.449 
question that I had received was why
can't<00:02:13.140> I<00:02:13.349> weld<00:02:13.620> these<00:02:13.740> vertices<00:02:14.130> back

00:02:14.449 --> 00:02:14.459 
can't I weld these vertices back

00:02:14.459 --> 00:02:17.900 
can't I weld these vertices back
together<00:02:14.670> so<00:02:15.150> if<00:02:15.510> I<00:02:15.900> wanted<00:02:16.319> to<00:02:16.530> say<00:02:17.250> well<00:02:17.610> this

00:02:17.900 --> 00:02:17.910 
together so if I wanted to say well this

00:02:17.910 --> 00:02:18.440 
together so if I wanted to say well this

construction<00:02:20.700> spline<00:02:21.420> why<00:02:21.720> can't<00:02:22.020> I<00:02:22.080> do<00:02:22.140> that

00:02:22.400 --> 00:02:22.410 
construction spline why can't I do that

00:02:22.410 --> 00:02:25.449 
construction spline why can't I do that
well<00:02:22.680> that<00:02:22.709> has<00:02:23.040> to<00:02:23.220> do<00:02:23.370> with<00:02:23.580> the<00:02:23.790> behavior<00:02:24.360> of

00:02:25.449 --> 00:02:25.459 
well that has to do with the behavior of

00:02:25.459 --> 00:02:28.369 
well that has to do with the behavior of
splines<00:02:26.810> mathematically<00:02:27.810> this<00:02:27.989> is<00:02:28.050> not

00:02:28.369 --> 00:02:28.379 
splines mathematically this is not

00:02:28.379 --> 00:02:30.650 
splines mathematically this is not

00:02:30.650 --> 00:02:30.660 
necessarily a limitation of 3ds max it

00:02:30.660 --> 00:02:33.259 
necessarily a limitation of 3ds max it
just<00:02:30.690> happens<00:02:31.170> to<00:02:31.260> be<00:02:31.379> what<00:02:32.310> spline<00:02:32.670> math<00:02:33.000> is

just happens to be what spline math is

00:02:33.269 --> 00:02:35.630 
just happens to be what spline math is
all<00:02:33.569> about<00:02:33.890> when<00:02:34.890> you<00:02:35.160> create<00:02:35.610> a

all about when you create a

all about when you create a
two-dimensional<00:02:36.090> spline<00:02:36.840> and<00:02:37.050> I'll<00:02:37.170> go<00:02:37.319> ahead

and<00:02:37.680> create<00:02:37.860> one<00:02:37.950> here<00:02:39.200> you<00:02:40.200> can<00:02:40.380> see<00:02:40.560> we're

00:02:40.729 --> 00:02:40.739 
and create one here you can see we're

00:02:40.739 --> 00:02:43.370 
and create one here you can see we're
just<00:02:40.769> creating<00:02:41.220> a<00:02:41.280> quick<00:02:41.489> spline<00:02:41.819> and<00:02:42.150> I'll<00:02:43.050> go

00:03:21.530 --> 00:03:21.540 
position of this vertex in 3d space so

00:03:21.540 --> 00:03:24.410

we can put this vertex in 3d space and

we get a curved shape going through that

00:03:26.670 --> 00:03:29.800 
we get a curved shape going through that

00:03:29.810 --> 00:03:32.270 
space and whatever our interpolation is
depends<00:03:30.810> on<00:03:30.930> the<00:03:31.049> curvature<00:03:31.530> of<00:03:31.560> that<00:03:31.709> spline

try<00:03:40.829> to<00:03:40.889> weld<00:03:41.280> this<00:03:41.850> back<00:03:42.209> on<00:03:42.480> here<00:03:42.870> you'll<00:03:43.049> see

00:03:43.280 --> 00:03:43.290 
try to weld this back on here you'll see

00:03:43.290 --> 00:03:45.289 
try to weld this back on here you'll see
that<00:03:43.440> I<00:03:43.500> can't<00:03:43.829> do<00:03:44.069> it<00:03:44.220> if<00:03:44.310> I<00:03:44.430> go<00:03:44.609> into<00:03:44.819> vertex

00:03:45.289 --> 00:03:45.299 
that I can't do it if I go into vertex

00:03:45.299 --> 00:03:50.090 
that I can't do it if I go into vertex
mode<00:03:46.250> and<00:03:47.250> I'll<00:03:47.880> go<00:03:48.329> ahead<00:03:48.450> and<00:03:48.989> we're<00:03:49.859> just

00:03:50.090 --> 00:03:50.100 
mode and I'll go ahead and we're just

00:03:50.100 --> 00:03:52.129 
mode and I'll go ahead and we're just
gonna<00:03:50.280> use<00:03:50.579> move<00:03:50.880> and<00:03:51.239> I'm<00:03:51.329> gonna<00:03:51.450> turn<00:03:51.690> on<00:03:51.750> my

00:03:52.129 --> 00:03:52.139 
gonna use move and I'm gonna turn on my

00:03:52.139 --> 00:03:54.410 
gonna use move and I'm gonna turn on my
snaps<00:03:52.950> here<00:03:53.280> we're<00:03:53.400> gonna<00:03:53.519> snap<00:03:53.819> to<00:03:54.000> a<00:03:54.030> vertex

00:03:54.410 --> 00:03:54.420 
snaps here we're gonna snap to a vertex

00:03:54.420 --> 00:03:56.000 
snaps here we're gonna snap to a vertex
and<00:03:54.630> I'm<00:03:54.690> just<00:03:54.840> gonna<00:03:54.930> snap<00:03:55.290> this<00:03:55.500> right<00:03:55.590> over

00:03:56.000 --> 00:03:56.010 
and I'm just gonna snap this right over

00:03:56.010 --> 00:03:58.340 
and I'm just gonna snap this right over
to<00:03:56.160> there<00:03:56.389> all<00:03:57.389> right<00:03:57.510> it<00:03:57.600> snapped<00:03:57.870> right<00:03:58.139> on

00:03:58.340 --> 00:03:58.350 
to there all right it snapped right on

00:03:58.350 --> 00:04:00.770 
to there all right it snapped right on
and<00:03:58.650> I'll<00:03:59.430> snap<00:03:59.760> this<00:03:59.910> one<00:04:00.090> back<00:04:00.239> on<00:04:00.420> there<00:04:00.660> as

00:04:00.770 --> 00:04:00.780 
and I'll snap this one back on there as

00:04:00.780 --> 00:04:03.680 
and I'll snap this one back on there as
well<00:04:00.959> so<00:04:00.989> now<00:04:01.319> they're<00:04:01.500> snapped<00:04:01.799> on<00:04:02.010> there<00:04:02.690> you

00:04:03.680 --> 00:04:03.690 
well so now they're snapped on there you

00:04:03.690 --> 00:04:05.930 
well so now they're snapped on there you
might<00:04:04.139> think<00:04:04.410> okay<00:04:04.739> well<00:04:04.980> they<00:04:05.400> are<00:04:05.670> now

00:04:05.930 --> 00:04:05.940 
might think okay well they are now

00:04:05.940 --> 00:04:07.610 
might think okay well they are now
connected<00:04:06.569> well<00:04:06.750> indeed<00:04:07.139> that's<00:04:07.319> not<00:04:07.500> the

00:04:07.610 --> 00:04:07.620 
connected well indeed that's not the

00:04:07.620 --> 00:04:09.379 
connected well indeed that's not the
case<00:04:07.799> if<00:04:08.040> I<00:04:08.160> turn<00:04:08.459> off<00:04:08.519> my<00:04:08.579> snapped<00:04:08.940> I'm<00:04:09.209> just

00:04:09.379 --> 00:04:09.389 
case if I turn off my snapped I'm just

00:04:09.389 --> 00:04:10.640 
case if I turn off my snapped I'm just
gonna<00:04:09.540> go<00:04:09.630> ahead<00:04:09.690> and<00:04:09.780> grab<00:04:10.019> this<00:04:10.230> of<00:04:10.410> this<00:04:10.530> you

00:04:10.640 --> 00:04:10.650 
gonna go ahead and grab this of this you

00:04:10.650 --> 00:04:12.830 
gonna go ahead and grab this of this you
can<00:04:10.769> see<00:04:10.950> that<00:04:11.160> they're<00:04:11.730> still<00:04:12.030> separated<00:04:12.660> and

00:04:12.830 --> 00:04:12.840 
can see that they're still separated and

00:04:12.840 --> 00:04:15.800 
can see that they're still separated and
even<00:04:13.380> when<00:04:13.560> I<00:04:13.620> select<00:04:14.010> both<00:04:14.099> of<00:04:14.340> them<00:04:14.730> and<00:04:14.810> go

00:04:15.800 --> 00:04:15.810 
even when I select both of them and go

00:04:15.810 --> 00:04:19.580 
even when I select both of them and go
into<00:04:16.349> my<00:04:17.329> modifier<00:04:18.329> command<00:04:18.870> panel<00:04:19.260> and<00:04:19.440> I

00:04:19.580 --> 00:04:19.590 
into my modifier command panel and I

00:04:19.590 --> 00:04:20.539 
into my modifier command panel and I
choose<00:04:19.829> weld

00:04:20.539 --> 00:04:20.549 
choose weld

00:04:20.549 --> 00:04:22.129 
choose weld
I'll<00:04:20.669> even<00:04:20.820> crank<00:04:21.419> this<00:04:21.539> down<00:04:21.599> to<00:04:21.870> zero<00:04:22.079> and

00:04:22.129 --> 00:04:22.139 
I'll even crank this down to zero and

00:04:22.139 --> 00:04:24.500 
I'll even crank this down to zero and
choose<00:04:22.410> weld<00:04:22.680> again<00:04:22.979> you'll<00:04:23.789> notice<00:04:24.240> that

00:04:24.500 --> 00:04:24.510 
choose weld again you'll notice that

00:04:24.510 --> 00:04:27.260 
choose weld again you'll notice that
they<00:04:25.139> don't<00:04:25.410> weld<00:04:25.800> and<00:04:26.130> that<00:04:26.310> is<00:04:26.460> because<00:04:26.849> it

00:04:27.260 --> 00:04:27.270 
they don't weld and that is because it

00:04:27.270 --> 00:04:29.810 
they don't weld and that is because it
is<00:04:27.960> a<00:04:28.320> mathematical<00:04:29.130> definition<00:04:29.280> a

00:04:29.810 --> 00:04:29.820 
is a mathematical definition a

00:04:29.820 --> 00:04:32.719 
is a mathematical definition a
mathematical<00:04:30.479> part<00:04:30.780> of<00:04:31.050> the<00:04:31.200> spline<00:04:31.560> so<00:04:32.070> you

00:04:32.719 --> 00:04:32.729 
mathematical part of the spline so you

00:04:32.729 --> 00:04:35.749 
mathematical part of the spline so you
can<00:04:32.849> only<00:04:33.120> have<00:04:33.659> with<00:04:34.650> one<00:04:34.979> vertex<00:04:35.550> on<00:04:35.729> a

can only have with one vertex on a
spline<00:04:36.150> you<00:04:36.389> can<00:04:36.539> only<00:04:36.779> have<00:04:37.110> at<00:04:37.499> most<00:04:38.210> two

00:04:39.200 --> 00:04:39.210 
spline you can only have at most two

00:04:39.210 --> 00:04:41.570 
spline you can only have at most two
segments<00:04:39.839> going<00:04:40.199> through<00:04:40.439> it<00:04:40.589> the<00:04:41.129> segment<00:04:41.520> on

00:04:53.570 --> 00:04:53.580 
you can it has one segment coming in but

00:04:53.580 --> 00:04:55.640 
you can it has one segment coming in but
it<00:04:53.699> does<00:04:53.879> not<00:04:54.029> have<00:04:54.330> another<00:04:54.659> segment<00:04:55.020> going

00:05:38.480 --> 00:05:38.490 
I change it to smooth or Bezier you can

00:05:38.490 --> 00:05:41.510 
I change it to smooth or Bezier you can
see<00:05:38.699> that<00:05:38.999> it's<00:05:39.270> now<00:05:39.479> acting<00:05:40.469> as<00:05:40.649> if<00:05:40.949> it<00:05:41.099> is<00:05:41.249> one

00:05:41.510 --> 00:05:41.520 
see that it's now acting as if it is one

00:05:41.520 --> 00:05:43.760 
see that it's now acting as if it is one
spline<00:05:41.969> so<00:05:42.209> you<00:05:42.270> can<00:05:42.509> actually<00:05:42.719> weld<00:05:43.199> endpoint

00:05:43.760 --> 00:05:43.770 
spline so you can actually weld endpoint

00:05:43.770 --> 00:05:47.269 
spline so you can actually weld endpoint

excuse<00:05:47.610> me<00:05:47.729> you<00:05:47.819> can<00:05:47.939> weld<00:05:48.120> endpoint<00:05:48.569> vertices

00:05:49.040 --> 00:05:49.050 
excuse me you can weld endpoint vertices

00:05:49.050 --> 00:05:52.790 
excuse me you can weld endpoint vertices
but<00:05:49.770> you<00:05:49.919> cannot<00:05:50.310> weld<00:05:50.729> vertices<00:05:51.529> to<00:05:52.529> another

00:05:52.790 --> 00:05:52.800 
but you cannot weld vertices to another

00:05:52.800 --> 00:05:55.129 
but you cannot weld vertices to another
vertex<00:05:53.159> that<00:05:53.399> already<00:05:53.939> has<00:05:54.149> two<00:05:54.539> segments

00:05:55.129 --> 00:05:55.139 
vertex that already has two segments

vertex that already has two segments
going<00:05:55.469> through<00:05:55.680> it<00:05:55.800> it's<00:05:55.949> just<00:05:56.219> part<00:05:56.520> of

00:05:56.589 --> 00:05:56.599 
going through it it's just part of

00:05:56.599 --> 00:05:59.420 
going through it it's just part of
spline<00:05:57.599> math<00:05:57.959> so<00:05:58.770> hopefully<00:05:59.099> this<00:05:59.279> clears

00:05:59.420 --> 00:05:59.430 
spline math so hopefully this clears

00:05:59.430 --> 00:06:02.360 
spline math so hopefully this clears
things<00:05:59.789> up<00:06:00.029> for<00:06:00.240> you
