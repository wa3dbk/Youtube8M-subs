toughness and scavenger and these ones
are<00:01:38.189> both<00:01:38.340> very<00:01:38.520> important<00:01:39.060> and<00:01:39.210> let<00:01:39.360> me<00:01:39.420> tell

00:01:39.530 --> 00:01:39.540 
are both very important and let me tell

00:01:39.540 --> 00:01:41.539 
are both very important and let me tell
you<00:01:39.659> guys<00:01:39.750> why<00:01:40.049> toughness<00:01:40.650> is<00:01:40.829> hands<00:01:41.250> down<00:01:41.400> one

00:01:41.539 --> 00:01:41.549 
you guys why toughness is hands down one

00:01:41.549 --> 00:01:43.490 
you guys why toughness is hands down one
of<00:01:41.880> the<00:01:42.000> best<00:01:42.390> parks<00:01:42.720> in<00:01:42.869> this<00:01:43.079> game<00:01:43.290> and

00:01:43.490 --> 00:01:43.500 
of the best parks in this game and

00:01:43.500 --> 00:01:44.780 
of the best parks in this game and
that's<00:01:43.619> just<00:01:43.829> because<00:01:43.950> it<00:01:44.159> pretty<00:01:44.369> much<00:01:44.520> helps

00:01:44.780 --> 00:01:44.790 
that's just because it pretty much helps

00:01:44.790 --> 00:01:46.340 
that's just because it pretty much helps
increase<00:01:44.939> your<00:01:45.240> accuracy<00:01:45.689> while<00:01:46.200> you're

00:01:46.340 --> 00:01:46.350 
increase your accuracy while you're

00:01:46.350 --> 00:01:48.020

00:01:48.020 --> 00:01:48.030 
getting shot at and i mean in any

00:01:48.030 --> 00:01:50.090 
getting shot at and i mean in any
first-person<00:01:48.780> game<00:01:48.990> of<00:01:49.229> course<00:01:49.530> accuracy<00:01:50.040> is

00:01:50.090 --> 00:01:50.100 
first-person game of course accuracy is

00:01:50.100 --> 00:01:51.679 
first-person game of course accuracy is
very<00:01:50.189> important<00:01:50.850> and<00:01:51.000> most<00:01:51.270> of<00:01:51.450> the<00:01:51.509> time

00:01:51.679 --> 00:01:51.689 
very important and most of the time

00:01:51.689 --> 00:01:52.999 
very important and most of the time
you're<00:01:51.840> shooting<00:01:52.140> you<00:01:52.259> will<00:01:52.380> be<00:01:52.500> getting<00:01:52.649> shot

00:01:52.999 --> 00:01:53.009 
you're shooting you will be getting shot

00:01:53.009 --> 00:01:54.620 
you're shooting you will be getting shot
at<00:01:53.189> so<00:01:53.430> it's<00:01:53.579> very<00:01:53.670> important<00:01:54.149> that<00:01:54.180> you<00:01:54.299> stay

00:01:54.620 --> 00:01:54.630 
at so it's very important that you stay

00:01:54.630 --> 00:01:56.510 
at so it's very important that you stay
on<00:01:54.659> target<00:01:55.170> using<00:01:55.530> this<00:01:55.740> perk<00:01:56.009> and<00:01:56.189> then<00:01:56.430> of

00:01:56.510 --> 00:01:56.520 
on target using this perk and then of

00:01:56.520 --> 00:01:58.130 
on target using this perk and then of
course<00:01:56.579> as<00:01:57.000> our<00:01:57.210> last<00:01:57.420> perk<00:01:57.659> we're<00:01:57.840> going<00:01:58.049> to

00:01:58.130 --> 00:01:58.140 
course as our last perk we're going to

00:01:58.140 --> 00:01:59.780 
course as our last perk we're going to
use<00:01:58.320> scavenger<00:01:58.979> because<00:01:59.250> if<00:01:59.430> you're<00:01:59.610> trying

00:01:59.780 --> 00:01:59.790 
use scavenger because if you're trying

00:01:59.790 --> 00:02:01.429 
use scavenger because if you're trying
to<00:01:59.909> get<00:02:00.060> killstreaks<00:02:00.270> or<00:02:00.689> more<00:02:00.960> importantly

00:02:01.429 --> 00:02:01.439 
to get killstreaks or more importantly

00:02:01.439 --> 00:02:03.230 
to get killstreaks or more importantly
the<00:02:01.619> DNA<00:02:01.979> bomb<00:02:02.189> you<00:02:02.490> will<00:02:02.729> be<00:02:02.850> running<00:02:02.969> out<00:02:03.210> of

00:02:03.230 --> 00:02:03.240 
the DNA bomb you will be running out of

00:02:03.240 --> 00:02:05.060 
the DNA bomb you will be running out of
ammo<00:02:03.509> very<00:02:03.750> quickly<00:02:04.079> as<00:02:04.380> for<00:02:04.710> the<00:02:04.799> EXO

00:02:05.060 --> 00:02:05.070 
ammo very quickly as for the EXO

00:02:05.070 --> 00:02:06.889 
ammo very quickly as for the EXO
abilities<00:02:05.100> i<00:02:05.460> would<00:02:05.759> go<00:02:05.880> with<00:02:05.909> EXO<00:02:06.420> overclock

00:02:06.889 --> 00:02:06.899 
abilities i would go with EXO overclock

00:02:06.899 --> 00:02:08.600 
abilities i would go with EXO overclock
which<00:02:07.110> makes<00:02:07.320> you<00:02:07.439> run<00:02:07.619> faster<00:02:07.680> for<00:02:08.310> a<00:02:08.340> short

00:02:08.600 --> 00:02:08.610 
which makes you run faster for a short

00:02:08.610 --> 00:02:09.919 
which makes you run faster for a short
period<00:02:08.670> of<00:02:09.060> time<00:02:09.119> so<00:02:09.569> it's<00:02:09.720> basically

00:02:09.919 --> 00:02:09.929 
period of time so it's basically

00:02:09.929 --> 00:02:11.380 
period of time so it's basically
adrenaline<00:02:10.739> and<00:02:10.890> this

00:02:11.380 --> 00:02:11.390 
adrenaline and this

00:02:11.390 --> 00:02:13.090 
adrenaline and this
and<00:02:11.480> all<00:02:11.660> that<00:02:11.840> useful<00:02:12.080> but<00:02:12.500> if<00:02:12.650> you<00:02:12.770> need<00:02:12.800> to

00:02:13.090 --> 00:02:13.100 
and all that useful but if you need to

00:02:13.100 --> 00:02:14.800 
and all that useful but if you need to
rush<00:02:13.370> somewhere<00:02:13.790> or<00:02:13.970> get<00:02:14.120> to<00:02:14.240> an<00:02:14.330> objective

00:02:14.800 --> 00:02:14.810 
rush somewhere or get to an objective

00:02:14.810 --> 00:02:16.780 
rush somewhere or get to an objective
quickly<00:02:15.230> then<00:02:15.440> it<00:02:15.560> will<00:02:15.860> help<00:02:16.100> you<00:02:16.190> out<00:02:16.370> quite

00:02:16.780 --> 00:02:16.790 
quickly then it will help you out quite

00:02:16.790 --> 00:02:18.760 
quickly then it will help you out quite
a<00:02:16.819> bit<00:02:16.940> and<00:02:17.360> for<00:02:17.600> the<00:02:17.690> killstreaks<00:02:18.200> I<00:02:18.380> just<00:02:18.590> use

00:02:18.760 --> 00:02:18.770 
a bit and for the killstreaks I just use

00:02:18.770 --> 00:02:20.590 
a bit and for the killstreaks I just use
UAV<00:02:19.250> and<00:02:19.490> system<00:02:19.910> hack<00:02:20.060> because<00:02:20.240> they're<00:02:20.480> not

00:02:20.590 --> 00:02:20.600 
UAV and system hack because they're not

00:02:20.600 --> 00:02:22.150 
UAV and system hack because they're not
super<00:02:20.810> hard<00:02:21.140> to<00:02:21.260> get<00:02:21.410> and<00:02:21.620> they<00:02:21.950> are<00:02:22.130> very

00:02:22.150 --> 00:02:22.160 
super hard to get and they are very

00:02:22.160 --> 00:02:24.250 
super hard to get and they are very
useful<00:02:22.700> and<00:02:23.060> that's<00:02:23.390> just<00:02:23.510> about<00:02:23.630> it<00:02:23.780> so

00:02:24.250 --> 00:02:24.260 
useful and that's just about it so

00:02:24.260 --> 00:02:25.750 
useful and that's just about it so
hopefully<00:02:24.410> you<00:02:24.709> guys<00:02:24.800> can<00:02:24.860> use<00:02:25.160> this<00:02:25.310> setup<00:02:25.580> to
