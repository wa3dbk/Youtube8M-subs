00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.520
 youtube and welcome to 

00:00:02.129 --> 00:00:10.110
 a presentation today from new holland 

00:00:05.520 --> 00:00:13.530
 t 7 270 yes finally is a new one 

00:00:10.110 --> 00:00:15.109
 holland come no ls 15 tag new 

00:00:13.530 --> 00:00:18.710
 mature or otherwise but one 

00:00:15.109 --> 00:00:21.210
 really new fashion not so in the 

00:00:18.710 --> 00:00:22.769
 Never seen it before 

00:00:21.210 --> 00:00:23.850
 could be that part of that 

00:00:22.769 --> 00:00:26.910
 reports three to come 

00:00:23.850 --> 00:00:30.570
 you can almost go out of it, but it is 

00:00:26.910 --> 00:00:32.430
 just as visually visible the new things 

00:00:30.570 --> 00:00:35.520
 frame in ls 15 were made 

00:00:32.430 --> 00:00:36.450
 of course, especially lights and must 

00:00:35.520 --> 00:00:39.750
 say here too 

00:00:36.450 --> 00:00:41.160
 this resolution of the types shield is 

00:00:39.750 --> 00:00:42.690
 The madness is really crazy 

00:00:41.160 --> 00:00:45.090
 Here we come down to the pure again 

00:00:42.690 --> 00:00:50.160
 It's gray again where it is 

00:00:45.090 --> 00:00:53.390
 there are some things here adblue where 

00:00:50.160 --> 00:00:54.840
 Some throws up well and badly 

00:00:53.390 --> 00:00:57.989
 or 

00:00:54.840 --> 00:00:59.910
 great and not so good the picture is 

00:00:57.989 --> 00:01:01.590
 you can leave relatively dark 

00:00:59.910 --> 00:01:02.420
 the great logo of holland is on everyone 

00:01:01.590 --> 00:01:06.150
 case available 

00:01:02.420 --> 00:01:12.119
 we have 300 ps real without power here 

00:01:06.150 --> 00:01:12.750
 without tuning or without not 

00:01:12.119 --> 00:01:15.119
 overclock 

00:01:12.750 --> 00:01:16.680
 in the graphics card , as I said without 

00:01:15.119 --> 00:01:19.170
 We usually have engine tuning 

00:01:16.680 --> 00:01:20.430
 default 270 ps 300 ps 

00:01:19.170 --> 00:01:24.150
 probably be maximum performance 

00:01:20.430 --> 00:01:30.540
 or just tuned 85,000 euros is the 

00:01:24.150 --> 00:01:33.329
 price 48 maintenance costs here 

00:01:30.540 --> 00:01:35.520
 not deciphering the job well what unfortunately 

00:01:33.329 --> 00:01:38.430
 too bad is that we at the new holland 

00:01:35.520 --> 00:01:41.460
 namely have one mistake and one 

00:01:38.430 --> 00:01:44.040
 mistake what the physics sun is going on steadily 

00:01:41.460 --> 00:01:47.250
 pimp-stretched moved even he 

00:01:44.040 --> 00:01:49.939
 answers 200 index look like holland 

00:01:47.250 --> 00:01:53.040
 the visual probably means that 

00:01:49.939 --> 00:01:57.570
 further down this error 

00:01:53.040 --> 00:02:00.469
 3d field hockey 3d and 3d 3d render 

00:01:57.570 --> 00:02:02.880
 can not be loaded 

00:02:00.469 --> 00:02:04.710
 Here are the tires though that is very 

00:02:02.880 --> 00:02:08.099
 pity that these errors appear here 

00:02:04.710 --> 00:02:10.050
 That's why you have to almost here 

00:02:08.099 --> 00:02:11.700
 because of the errors in the star 

00:02:10.050 --> 00:02:16.760
 if you have them here but mature 

00:02:11.700 --> 00:02:19.440
 look at and you get the rims really 

00:02:16.760 --> 00:02:21.420
 strong eyes because it is just extreme 

00:02:19.440 --> 00:02:22.860
 dresses looks good here I am exactly 

00:02:21.420 --> 00:02:23.550
 behind the texture is not so 

00:02:22.860 --> 00:02:25.080
 as I thought 

00:02:23.550 --> 00:02:28.980
 from the distance here but it looks 

00:02:25.080 --> 00:02:32.099
 extremely horny so you can not get one 

00:02:28.980 --> 00:02:34.580
 eye close here in the rear area yes 

00:02:32.099 --> 00:02:38.220
 I want to say everything necessary 

00:02:34.580 --> 00:02:40.379
 looks acceptable in the substructure okay 

00:02:38.220 --> 00:02:42.989
 rather than doing nothing at all 

00:02:40.379 --> 00:02:44.489
 a few textures on it is clapping 

00:02:42.989 --> 00:02:45.349
 better than nothing I agree 

00:02:44.489 --> 00:02:47.190
 completely too 

00:02:45.349 --> 00:02:49.950
 but if you are here for example the 

00:02:47.190 --> 00:02:51.750
 texture looks good is down on the ground 

00:02:49.950 --> 00:02:53.250
 Here we come the question many see each other 

00:02:51.750 --> 00:02:55.739
 a tractor from the ground but I think that's 

00:02:53.250 --> 00:02:57.750
 just as much a part of it is the rim 

00:02:55.739 --> 00:02:59.580
 inside as the rim claps them 

00:02:57.750 --> 00:03:01.800
 and that should also be one 

00:02:59.580 --> 00:03:03.930
 a little bit from the sea, yes, see what 

00:03:01.800 --> 00:03:05.519
 nice is that here cut this 

00:03:03.930 --> 00:03:07.470
 works quite well even if we still here 

00:03:05.519 --> 00:03:10.379
 see such small particles because they are well 

00:03:07.470 --> 00:03:11.370
 That's where the form belongs 

00:03:10.379 --> 00:03:14.069
 extremely cool 

00:03:11.370 --> 00:03:15.180
 The color is extremely cool there we have 

00:03:14.069 --> 00:03:16.379
 here again such pixelations 

00:03:15.180 --> 00:03:17.849
 not need to be there 

00:03:16.379 --> 00:03:19.409
 that's always a shame then something 

00:03:17.849 --> 00:03:20.489
 turns up because when it completely disappears 

00:03:19.409 --> 00:03:22.560
 like here on the 

00:03:20.489 --> 00:03:24.989
 bonnet is not something like that 

00:03:22.560 --> 00:03:27.349
 This white air quality is there 

00:03:24.989 --> 00:03:29.760
 This is about these sausages flowers 

00:03:27.349 --> 00:03:31.280
 dark blue edition or so on everyone 

00:03:29.760 --> 00:03:33.540
 In case you also see the senior 

00:03:31.280 --> 00:03:35.250
 blue is darker than normal 

00:03:33.540 --> 00:03:37.650
 so we have full here 

00:03:35.250 --> 00:03:39.330
 headlights as you can see 

00:03:37.650 --> 00:03:40.920
 usually training originate 

00:03:39.330 --> 00:03:43.170
 not seehofer know and I think 

00:03:40.920 --> 00:03:46.920
 which disturb the optical a bit 

00:03:43.170 --> 00:03:51.150
 you could have become quiet here now 

00:03:46.920 --> 00:03:52.260
 so 3d objects three that seem there 

00:03:51.150 --> 00:03:53.069
 I think I could adjust 

00:03:52.260 --> 00:03:56.250
 better looking 

00:03:53.069 --> 00:03:58.590
 we have new ones up here as well 

00:03:56.250 --> 00:04:00.209
 horns honking this just even with 

00:03:58.590 --> 00:04:01.470
 lighting but not working 

00:04:00.209 --> 00:04:02.189
 no, people do not work 

00:04:01.470 --> 00:04:04.830
 get off at 1 

00:04:02.189 --> 00:04:07.290
 you see all around this 

00:04:04.830 --> 00:04:09.720
 by default, all 15 and see too 

00:04:07.290 --> 00:04:11.939
 great as well we have blinker the 

00:04:09.720 --> 00:04:13.590
 really perfectly placed are the 

00:04:11.939 --> 00:04:15.269
 but here are at least nice lights 

00:04:13.590 --> 00:04:17.090
 you can really say that 

00:04:15.269 --> 00:04:18.959
 even more, they just look 

00:04:17.090 --> 00:04:22.070
 fantastic so we can go here 

00:04:18.959 --> 00:04:24.090
 go down again where so the 

00:04:22.070 --> 00:04:25.560
 Spotlights here are really good 

00:04:24.090 --> 00:04:27.680
 like I said here this 

00:04:25.560 --> 00:04:32.190
 local side madness 

00:04:27.680 --> 00:04:37.199
 top speed is determined 50 

00:04:32.190 --> 00:04:40.110
 km / h minimum jo is 51 exactly lies here 

00:04:37.199 --> 00:04:42.240
 front then worklights front and 

00:04:40.110 --> 00:04:43.979
 work because the affair used ok because 

00:04:42.240 --> 00:04:45.090
 I like everything 15 by default 

00:04:43.979 --> 00:04:49.110
 I think I have to get better too 

00:04:45.090 --> 00:04:52.680
 You do not switch that often by exactly 

00:04:49.110 --> 00:04:55.680
 So it's hard here the mod four 

00:04:52.680 --> 00:04:58.560
 or to give five stars because easy 

00:04:55.680 --> 00:05:01.560
 the valuation are mirrored perfectly in 

00:04:58.560 --> 00:05:03.539
 Mirror attached to the perfect 

00:05:01.560 --> 00:05:05.990
 Positioned stuck like 

00:05:03.539 --> 00:05:08.759
 you want to call that the mini km / h 

00:05:05.990 --> 00:05:09.990
 display right to monika in front and 

00:05:08.759 --> 00:05:11.130
 otherwise the whole form console 

00:05:09.990 --> 00:05:13.680
 a look that times right at it looks 

00:05:11.130 --> 00:05:15.060
 really just where she sees it 

00:05:13.680 --> 00:05:18.150
 damn good if you look at that 

00:05:15.060 --> 00:05:21.389
 switch the depth where the floor looks 

00:05:18.150 --> 00:05:23.009
 the seats do not catch up with logo 

00:05:21.389 --> 00:05:25.110
 here are the tics the left side 

00:05:23.009 --> 00:05:27.360
 inside view I have to say is the 

00:05:25.110 --> 00:05:29.070
 Hammer is really there we were 

00:05:27.360 --> 00:05:30.660
 unfortunately no ec disturbance could you 

00:05:29.070 --> 00:05:33.120
 maybe paste at a v2 

00:05:30.660 --> 00:05:34.919
 For example, here the back window the doors 

00:05:33.120 --> 00:05:36.660
 and the roof window will be option 

00:05:34.919 --> 00:05:38.880
 maybe even a sun roof if 

00:05:36.660 --> 00:05:40.680
 that would be possible I think many will 

00:05:38.880 --> 00:05:43.470
 happy and things like the front 

00:05:40.680 --> 00:05:47.610
 here the front force lift so the 

00:05:43.470 --> 00:05:50.100
 front under handlebar here yes 

00:05:47.610 --> 00:05:52.560
 close and close and also 

00:05:50.100 --> 00:05:55.410
 The front of the steering wheel area looks real 

00:05:52.560 --> 00:05:58.530
 Extremely horny from the steering wheel is perfect 

00:05:55.410 --> 00:06:00.630
 just can be 270 degrees 

00:05:58.530 --> 00:06:02.900
 turn if not even one more 

00:06:00.630 --> 00:06:02.900
 a little further 

00:06:03.460 --> 00:06:10.389
 It's the madness I have to say 

00:06:06.039 --> 00:06:12.009
 really the madness and that's the way it is 

00:06:10.389 --> 00:06:14.380
 even with the fenders they stay 

00:06:12.009 --> 00:06:16.569
 really to hire hanging on the 

00:06:14.380 --> 00:06:18.190
 body or shortly before and the 

00:06:16.569 --> 00:06:18.759
 Tire still steers a bit 

00:06:18.190 --> 00:06:22.419
 continue 

00:06:18.759 --> 00:06:23.560
 so i could it's so hard here 

00:06:22.419 --> 00:06:27.009
 to make the judgment 

00:06:23.560 --> 00:06:28.270
 neither would that be exactly the middle of it 

00:06:27.009 --> 00:06:31.270
 are a few things like the lok error 

00:06:28.270 --> 00:06:33.340
 and a few things like here on the 

00:06:31.270 --> 00:06:35.259
 where I say that's three 

00:06:33.340 --> 00:06:36.729
 Stables difference that's that's that 

00:06:35.259 --> 00:06:38.949
 is a star here 

00:06:36.729 --> 00:06:41.050
 this point and here is 5 stars 

00:06:38.949 --> 00:06:44.289
 that's just where in this extreme hole 

00:06:41.050 --> 00:06:46.750
 it then applies mediocre to find and 

00:06:44.289 --> 00:06:48.099
 That's why I think you can actually 

00:06:46.750 --> 00:06:49.810
 but give five stars if you look at yourself 

00:06:48.099 --> 00:06:53.320
 before looking at the axis that also has 

00:06:49.810 --> 00:06:55.000
 not perfect but thanks to this texture 

00:06:53.320 --> 00:06:56.590
 you have to almost 5 star revealed that 

00:06:55.000 --> 00:06:58.419
 farfal is alright too 

00:06:56.590 --> 00:07:01.120
 is also a point that absolutely 

00:06:58.419 --> 00:07:02.830
 okay the sound is normal nice 

00:07:01.120 --> 00:07:04.270
 quietly pleasing to him 

00:07:02.830 --> 00:07:05.979
 So I think here you can really 

00:07:04.270 --> 00:07:07.659
 then the five stars forgive that too 

00:07:05.979 --> 00:07:10.570
 is enough tractors all five spot 

00:07:07.659 --> 00:07:12.280
 was cool day I would say so long 

00:07:10.570 --> 00:07:14.320
 that was it from him this exhibition 

00:07:12.280 --> 00:07:15.460
 I was happy when the last one comes 

00:07:14.320 --> 00:07:18.460
 after a little surprise 

00:07:15.460 --> 00:07:20.909
 look forward to it I'm out makes good 

00:07:18.460 --> 00:07:20.909
 Hello 

00:07:26.070 --> 00:07:32.150
 ddddddddddddddd 

00:07:36.270 --> 00:07:39.270
 here
