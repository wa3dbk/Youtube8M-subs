equalizers going into the input of the
feedback<00:01:11.210> for<00:01:11.420> it<00:01:11.450> so<00:01:11.630> the<00:01:11.720> feedback<00:01:11.930> part<00:01:12.260> is

00:01:12.460 --> 00:01:12.470 
feedback for it so the feedback part is

then you can use the 2 by 15 and here's

00:02:03.200 --> 00:02:07.539 
then you can use the 2 by 15 and here's
why<00:02:04.450> simply<00:02:05.450> you<00:02:05.689> have<00:02:05.750> more<00:02:05.990> bands<00:02:06.229> and<00:02:06.560> for

00:02:07.539 --> 00:02:07.549 
why simply you have more bands and for

00:02:07.549 --> 00:02:10.540 
why simply you have more bands and for
an<00:02:07.640> example<00:02:08.209> say<00:02:09.050> if<00:02:09.080> I<00:02:09.349> wanted<00:02:09.770> to<00:02:09.830> like<00:02:10.340> right

00:02:10.540 --> 00:02:10.550 
an example say if I wanted to like right

00:02:10.550 --> 00:02:12.190 
an example say if I wanted to like right
here<00:02:10.789> and<00:02:10.819> I<00:02:10.970> know<00:02:11.030> you<00:02:11.150> can't<00:02:11.780> see<00:02:11.959> it<00:02:12.080> too

00:02:12.190 --> 00:02:12.200 
here and I know you can't see it too

00:02:12.200 --> 00:02:13.630 
here and I know you can't see it too
well<00:02:12.230> so<00:02:12.470> I'm<00:02:12.590> just<00:02:12.620> going<00:02:12.920> to<00:02:13.010> do

00:02:13.630 --> 00:02:13.640 
well so I'm just going to do

00:02:13.640 --> 00:02:17.830 
well so I'm just going to do
is<00:02:13.790> the<00:02:13.940> 1<00:02:14.180> 1<00:02:14.720> K<00:02:15.020> um<00:02:15.460> one<00:02:16.460> get<00:02:16.670> one<00:02:16.850> kill<00:02:17.300> 1000

00:02:17.830 --> 00:02:17.840 
is the 1 1 K um one get one kill 1000

00:02:17.840 --> 00:02:22.420 
is the 1 1 K um one get one kill 1000
Hertz<00:02:18.020> and<00:02:18.260> then<00:02:18.770> 1.6<00:02:20.080> kilohertz<00:02:21.080> there<00:02:21.430> those

00:02:22.420 --> 00:02:22.430 
Hertz and then 1.6 kilohertz there those

00:02:22.430 --> 00:02:25.090 
Hertz and then 1.6 kilohertz there those
two<00:02:22.760> and<00:02:23.120> then<00:02:23.930> you<00:02:24.020> look<00:02:24.200> on<00:02:24.350> the<00:02:24.470> one<00:02:24.680> then

00:02:25.090 --> 00:02:25.100 
two and then you look on the one then

00:02:25.100 --> 00:02:26.620 
two and then you look on the one then
are<00:02:25.250> you<00:02:25.340> looking<00:02:25.580> on<00:02:25.670> the<00:02:25.760> frequency<00:02:26.240> bands

00:02:26.620 --> 00:02:26.630 
are you looking on the frequency bands

00:02:26.630 --> 00:02:31.480 
are you looking on the frequency bands
for<00:02:26.930> the<00:02:27.170> 31<00:02:27.770> band<00:02:28.069> you<00:02:28.700> have<00:02:28.970> one<00:02:29.510> k<00:02:30.130> 1.25<00:02:31.130> K

00:02:31.480 --> 00:02:31.490 
for the 31 band you have one k 1.25 K

00:02:31.490 --> 00:02:34.780 
for the 31 band you have one k 1.25 K
and<00:02:31.760> then<00:02:32.330> 1.6<00:02:33.110> so<00:02:33.770> what<00:02:34.040> I've<00:02:34.160> done<00:02:34.400> is<00:02:34.459> i

00:02:34.780 --> 00:02:34.790 
and then 1.6 so what I've done is i

00:02:34.790 --> 00:02:36.520 
and then 1.6 so what I've done is i
bypass<00:02:35.270> the<00:02:35.300> feedback<00:02:35.840> ferrets<00:02:36.230> so<00:02:36.380> it

00:02:36.520 --> 00:02:36.530 
bypass the feedback ferrets so it

00:02:36.530 --> 00:02:40.030 
bypass the feedback ferrets so it
doesn't<00:02:36.920> notch<00:02:37.130> it<00:02:37.370> out<00:02:37.459> I<00:02:37.780> have<00:02:38.780> the<00:02:39.230> EQ<00:02:39.950> is

00:02:40.030 --> 00:02:40.040 
doesn't notch it out I have the EQ is

00:02:40.040 --> 00:02:43.800 
doesn't notch it out I have the EQ is
enabled<00:02:40.850> with<00:02:41.060> the<00:02:41.209> forty-third<00:02:42.110> self<00:02:42.550> lope

00:02:43.800 --> 00:02:43.810 
enabled with the forty-third self lope

00:02:43.810 --> 00:02:45.880 
enabled with the forty-third self lope
filters<00:02:44.810> they're<00:02:44.930> the<00:02:45.050> high-pass<00:02:45.410> filter

00:02:45.880 --> 00:02:45.890 
filters they're the high-pass filter

00:02:45.890 --> 00:02:52.000 
filters they're the high-pass filter
so<00:02:46.810> I'm<00:02:47.810> going<00:02:48.080> to<00:02:48.260> also<00:02:48.739> show<00:02:49.040> I<00:02:49.820> have<00:02:50.320> the<00:02:51.320> USB

00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:52.010

is<00:04:03.170> the<00:04:03.380> perfect<00:04:03.590> size<00:04:03.860> 12<00:04:04.310> 12<00:04:04.790> 12<00:04:05.390> channels<00:04:05.690> of

00:04:06.009 --> 00:04:06.019 
is the perfect size 12 12 12 channels of

00:04:06.019 --> 00:04:09.039 
is the perfect size 12 12 12 channels of
xlrs<00:04:06.950> now<00:04:07.700> the<00:04:07.760> only<00:04:08.150> thing<00:04:08.390> I've<00:04:08.540> had<00:04:08.750> to<00:04:08.900> make

00:04:09.039 --> 00:04:09.049 
xlrs now the only thing I've had to make

00:04:09.049 --> 00:04:11.160 
xlrs now the only thing I've had to make
an<00:04:09.290> exception<00:04:09.829> with<00:04:10.040> with<00:04:10.730> the<00:04:10.910> little

00:04:11.160 --> 00:04:11.170 
an exception with with the little

00:04:11.170 --> 00:04:13.270 
an exception with with the little
ingenuity<00:04:12.170> is<00:04:12.290> that<00:04:12.500> these<00:04:12.680> were<00:04:12.829> two<00:04:12.890> wires

00:04:13.270 --> 00:04:13.280 
ingenuity is that these were two wires

00:04:13.280 --> 00:04:15.550 
ingenuity is that these were two wires
these<00:04:14.209> are<00:04:14.390> on<00:04:14.480> the<00:04:14.510> two<00:04:14.810> on<00:04:14.930> the<00:04:15.019> two<00:04:15.200> stereo

00:04:15.550 --> 00:04:15.560 
these are on the two on the two stereo

00:04:15.560 --> 00:04:18.219 
these are on the two on the two stereo
channel<00:04:16.100> stereo<00:04:16.459> channels<00:04:16.989> you<00:04:17.989> can<00:04:18.140> either

00:04:18.219 --> 00:04:18.229 
channel stereo channels you can either

00:04:18.229 --> 00:04:21.789 
channel stereo channels you can either
use<00:04:18.530> the<00:04:18.769> left<00:04:19.160> and<00:04:19.280> right<00:04:19.370> inputs<00:04:19.850> or<00:04:20.620> you<00:04:21.620> use

00:04:21.789 --> 00:04:21.799 
use the left and right inputs or you use

00:04:21.799 --> 00:04:24.940 
use the left and right inputs or you use
the<00:04:21.830> X<00:04:22.099> or<00:04:22.340> use<00:04:22.580> the<00:04:22.729> XLR<00:04:23.120> input<00:04:23.479> so<00:04:23.750> I<00:04:23.990> wanted

00:04:24.940 --> 00:04:24.950 
the X or use the XLR input so I wanted

00:04:24.950 --> 00:04:26.850 
the X or use the XLR input so I wanted
to<00:04:25.039> have<00:04:25.190> the<00:04:25.340> ability<00:04:25.789> to<00:04:26.030> have

00:04:26.850 --> 00:04:26.860 
to have the ability to have

00:04:26.860 --> 00:04:29.399 
to have the ability to have
everything<00:04:27.219> in<00:04:27.430> a<00:04:27.520> balanced<00:04:28.409> configuration

00:04:29.399 --> 00:04:29.409 
everything in a balanced configuration

00:04:29.409 --> 00:04:31.320 
everything in a balanced configuration
because<00:04:29.650> we<00:04:30.039> all<00:04:30.159> know<00:04:30.370> that<00:04:30.550> unbalance<00:04:31.150> is

00:04:31.320 --> 00:04:31.330 
because we all know that unbalance is

00:04:31.330 --> 00:04:32.580 
because we all know that unbalance is
unprofessional

00:04:32.580 --> 00:04:32.590 
unprofessional

00:04:32.590 --> 00:04:35.550 
unprofessional
so<00:04:33.189> I<00:04:33.219> run<00:04:33.520> these<00:04:33.669> down<00:04:33.939> to<00:04:34.270> a<00:04:34.810> mic<00:04:35.199> splitter

00:04:35.550 --> 00:04:35.560 
so I run these down to a mic splitter

00:04:35.560 --> 00:04:38.040 
so I run these down to a mic splitter
isolator<00:04:36.129> it's<00:04:36.340> got<00:04:36.520> a<00:04:36.550> transformer<00:04:37.270> in<00:04:37.419> it<00:04:37.539> so

00:04:38.040 --> 00:04:38.050 
isolator it's got a transformer in it so

00:04:38.050 --> 00:04:43.439 
isolator it's got a transformer in it so
if<00:04:38.319> I<00:04:38.439> wanted<00:04:38.919> to<00:04:40.680> provide<00:04:41.680> phantom<00:04:42.250> power<00:04:42.460> to

00:04:43.439 --> 00:04:43.449 
if I wanted to provide phantom power to

00:04:43.449 --> 00:04:44.820 
if I wanted to provide phantom power to
any<00:04:43.599> of<00:04:43.719> the<00:04:43.810> u2z<00:04:44.289> for<00:04:44.439> the<00:04:44.560> condenser

00:04:44.820 --> 00:04:44.830 
any of the u2z for the condenser

00:04:44.830 --> 00:04:46.800 
any of the u2z for the condenser
microphones<00:04:45.400> I<00:04:45.460> really<00:04:45.669> haven't<00:04:45.819> had<00:04:46.030> an

00:04:46.800 --> 00:04:46.810 
microphones I really haven't had an

00:04:46.810 --> 00:04:49.800 
microphones I really haven't had an
opportunity<00:04:47.139> to<00:04:47.469> use<00:04:47.710> this<00:04:47.919> so<00:04:48.099> much<00:04:48.250> but<00:04:48.879> this

00:04:49.800 --> 00:04:49.810 
opportunity to use this so much but this

00:04:49.810 --> 00:04:51.570 
opportunity to use this so much but this
is<00:04:49.990> where<00:04:50.169> the<00:04:50.289> input<00:04:50.650> well<00:04:51.340> the<00:04:51.430> out

00:04:51.570 --> 00:04:51.580 
is where the input well the out

00:04:51.580 --> 00:04:54.689 
is where the input well the out
technically<00:04:52.210> the<00:04:52.300> output<00:04:53.129> comes<00:04:54.129> into<00:04:54.490> play

00:04:54.689 --> 00:04:54.699 
technically the output comes into play

00:04:54.699 --> 00:04:58.800 
technically the output comes into play
and<00:04:56.699> if<00:04:57.699> there<00:04:57.969> you<00:04:58.030> have<00:04:58.150> one<00:04:58.360> side<00:04:58.569> that<00:04:58.689> has

00:04:58.800 --> 00:04:58.810 
and if there you have one side that has

00:04:58.810 --> 00:05:00.450 
and if there you have one side that has
phantom<00:04:59.229> power<00:04:59.409> one<00:04:59.620> that<00:04:59.770> doesn't<00:05:00.159> and<00:05:00.310> this

00:05:00.450 --> 00:05:00.460 
phantom power one that doesn't and this

00:05:00.460 --> 00:05:03.830 
phantom power one that doesn't and this
will<00:05:00.669> go<00:05:00.849> out<00:05:01.000> to<00:05:01.210> my<00:05:01.360> recording<00:05:02.169> board<00:05:03.129> with<00:05:03.370> a

00:05:03.830 --> 00:05:03.840 
will go out to my recording board with a

00:05:03.840 --> 00:05:07.409 
will go out to my recording board with a
tip<00:05:04.840> ring<00:05:05.020> sleeve<00:05:05.189> female<00:05:06.189> connector<00:05:06.610> so<00:05:07.210> what

00:05:07.409 --> 00:05:07.419 
tip ring sleeve female connector so what

00:05:07.419 --> 00:05:09.540 
tip ring sleeve female connector so what
I'm<00:05:07.509> going<00:05:07.599> to<00:05:07.659> do<00:05:07.960> right<00:05:08.169> now<00:05:08.229> for<00:05:08.550> today's

00:05:09.540 --> 00:05:09.550 
I'm going to do right now for today's

00:05:09.550 --> 00:05:11.100 
I'm going to do right now for today's
demonstration<00:05:09.759> so<00:05:10.330> this<00:05:10.479> video<00:05:10.719> doesn't<00:05:10.930> get

00:05:11.100 --> 00:05:11.110 
demonstration so this video doesn't get

00:05:11.110 --> 00:05:13.830 
demonstration so this video doesn't get
too<00:05:11.319> too<00:05:11.529> long<00:05:11.830> is<00:05:12.129> I'm<00:05:12.669> going<00:05:12.819> to<00:05:12.909> play<00:05:13.270> a<00:05:13.509> pure

00:05:13.830 --> 00:05:13.840 
too too long is I'm going to play a pure

00:05:13.840 --> 00:05:17.279 
too too long is I'm going to play a pure
sine<00:05:14.169> wave<00:05:14.199> tone<00:05:14.770> through<00:05:15.370> audacity<00:05:16.090> which<00:05:16.870> it

00:05:17.279 --> 00:05:17.289 
sine wave tone through audacity which it

00:05:17.289 --> 00:05:22.950 
sine wave tone through audacity which it
does<00:05:17.949> have<00:05:18.189> monitoring<00:05:18.819> capabilities<00:05:21.960> here

00:05:22.950 --> 00:05:22.960 
does have monitoring capabilities here

00:05:22.960 --> 00:05:26.309 
does have monitoring capabilities here
I'm<00:05:23.710> going<00:05:23.860> to<00:05:23.919> play<00:05:24.099> it's<00:05:24.340> a<00:05:24.719> 1.25<00:05:25.719> kilohertz

00:05:26.309 --> 00:05:26.319 
I'm going to play it's a 1.25 kilohertz

00:05:26.319 --> 00:05:28.860 
I'm going to play it's a 1.25 kilohertz
pure<00:05:27.159> sine<00:05:27.370> wave<00:05:27.400> tone<00:05:27.819> and<00:05:28.120> I'm<00:05:28.599> just<00:05:28.719> going

00:05:28.860 --> 00:05:28.870 
pure sine wave tone and I'm just going

00:05:28.870 --> 00:05:31.469 
pure sine wave tone and I'm just going
to<00:05:28.900> show<00:05:29.110> you<00:05:29.169> the<00:05:29.770> drawbacks<00:05:30.639> of<00:05:30.879> having<00:05:30.940> a<00:05:31.300> 2

00:05:31.469 --> 00:05:31.479 
to show you the drawbacks of having a 2

00:05:31.479 --> 00:05:34.800 
to show you the drawbacks of having a 2
by<00:05:31.629> 15<00:05:32.050> versus<00:05:32.440> a<00:05:32.469> 131<00:05:33.099> band<00:05:33.460> not<00:05:34.060> necessarily

00:05:34.800 --> 00:05:34.810 
by 15 versus a 131 band not necessarily

00:05:34.810 --> 00:05:37.110 
by 15 versus a 131 band not necessarily
for<00:05:35.080> the<00:05:35.289> feedback<00:05:35.529> location<00:05:36.279> but<00:05:36.520> what

00:05:37.110 --> 00:05:37.120 
for the feedback location but what

00:05:37.120 --> 00:05:38.670 
for the feedback location but what
happens<00:05:37.509> if<00:05:37.659> you<00:05:37.779> only<00:05:37.960> if<00:05:38.110> you<00:05:38.259> don't<00:05:38.379> have<00:05:38.589> as

00:05:38.670 --> 00:05:38.680 
happens if you only if you don't have as

00:05:38.680 --> 00:05:40.499 
happens if you only if you don't have as
many<00:05:38.800> bands<00:05:39.190> you<00:05:39.279> can't<00:05:39.520> chop<00:05:39.849> up<00:05:40.089> the

00:05:40.499 --> 00:05:40.509 
many bands you can't chop up the

00:05:40.509 --> 00:05:44.189 
many bands you can't chop up the
frequency<00:05:40.990> band<00:05:41.199> as<00:05:41.610> much<00:05:42.610> as<00:05:42.819> with<00:05:43.690> the<00:05:43.839> 15

00:05:44.189 --> 00:05:44.199 
frequency band as much as with the 15

00:05:44.199 --> 00:05:47.550 
frequency band as much as with the 15
band<00:05:44.440> so<00:05:44.680> let's<00:05:45.039> play<00:05:45.250> this<00:05:45.400> tone<00:05:46.379> so<00:05:47.379> there's

00:05:47.550 --> 00:05:47.560 
band so let's play this tone so there's

00:05:47.560 --> 00:05:50.010 
band so let's play this tone so there's
the<00:05:47.710> tone<00:05:47.889> you<00:05:48.069> can<00:05:48.099> kind<00:05:48.550> of<00:05:48.610> hear<00:05:48.789> it<00:05:48.940> I<00:05:49.089> have

00:05:50.010 --> 00:05:50.020 
the tone you can kind of hear it I have

00:05:50.020 --> 00:05:54.059 
the tone you can kind of hear it I have
the<00:05:50.199> volume<00:05:50.500> down<00:05:50.650> so<00:05:51.240> I<00:05:52.240> have<00:05:52.539> it<00:05:52.719> will<00:05:53.379> route

00:05:54.059 --> 00:05:54.069 
the volume down so I have it will route

00:05:54.069 --> 00:05:55.230 
the volume down so I have it will route
it<00:05:54.250> through<00:05:54.279> this<00:05:54.490> channel<00:05:54.729> you<00:05:55.089> got<00:05:55.210> a

00:05:55.230 --> 00:05:55.240 
it through this channel you got a

00:05:55.240 --> 00:05:57.629 
it through this channel you got a
negative<00:05:55.479> cut<00:05:55.960> negative<00:05:56.740> 15<00:05:57.069> dB

00:05:57.629 --> 00:05:57.639 
negative cut negative 15 dB

00:05:57.639 --> 00:06:00.119 
negative cut negative 15 dB
so<00:05:58.060> right<00:05:58.779> off<00:05:58.810> the<00:05:58.930> bat<00:05:59.229> you<00:05:59.409> could<00:05:59.589> see<00:05:59.860> that

00:06:00.119 --> 00:06:00.129 
so right off the bat you could see that

00:06:00.129 --> 00:06:03.809 
so right off the bat you could see that
the<00:06:00.509> 1.25<00:06:01.509> K<00:06:01.810> fader<00:06:02.409> and<00:06:02.740> the<00:06:03.159> location

00:06:03.809 --> 00:06:03.819 
the 1.25 K fader and the location

00:06:03.819 --> 00:06:06.360 
the 1.25 K fader and the location
feedback<00:06:04.210> location<00:06:04.779> is<00:06:04.900> coming<00:06:05.199> up<00:06:05.319> but<00:06:06.159> if

00:06:06.360 --> 00:06:06.370 
feedback location is coming up but if

00:06:06.370 --> 00:06:09.269 
feedback location is coming up but if
you<00:06:06.460> look<00:06:06.669> on<00:06:06.879> the<00:06:07.719> 15s<00:06:08.379> it's<00:06:08.860> right<00:06:09.159> in

00:06:09.269 --> 00:06:09.279 
you look on the 15s it's right in

00:06:09.279 --> 00:06:12.629 
you look on the 15s it's right in
between<00:06:09.400> the<00:06:09.759> 1k<00:06:10.330> and<00:06:10.360> the<00:06:10.750> 1.6<00:06:11.409> K<00:06:11.680> so<00:06:11.979> say<00:06:12.580> if

00:06:12.629 --> 00:06:12.639 
between the 1k and the 1.6 K so say if

00:06:12.639 --> 00:06:15.779 
between the 1k and the 1.6 K so say if
you<00:06:12.879> were<00:06:13.029> to<00:06:13.089> you<00:06:14.050> know<00:06:14.139> cut<00:06:14.889> the<00:06:14.919> cut<00:06:15.639> those

00:06:15.779 --> 00:06:15.789 
you were to you know cut the cut those

00:06:15.789 --> 00:06:18.119 
you were to you know cut the cut those
frequencies<00:06:16.300> down<00:06:16.860> you're<00:06:17.860> going<00:06:17.949> to<00:06:18.009> be

00:06:18.119 --> 00:06:18.129 
frequencies down you're going to be

00:06:18.129 --> 00:06:19.589 
frequencies down you're going to be
cutting<00:06:18.339> out<00:06:18.550> a<00:06:18.580> lot<00:06:18.789> more<00:06:18.939> of<00:06:19.029> the<00:06:19.120> frequency

00:06:19.589 --> 00:06:19.599 
cutting out a lot more of the frequency

00:06:19.599 --> 00:06:22.079 
cutting out a lot more of the frequency
band<00:06:19.810> than<00:06:20.020> you<00:06:20.139> should<00:06:20.379> and<00:06:20.680> it<00:06:21.639> takes<00:06:21.879> away

00:06:22.079 --> 00:06:22.089 
band than you should and it takes away

00:06:22.089 --> 00:06:24.809 
band than you should and it takes away
from<00:06:22.120> yet<00:06:22.629> from<00:06:23.050> the<00:06:23.169> total<00:06:23.529> signal<00:06:24.159> and<00:06:24.550> then

00:06:24.809 --> 00:06:24.819 
from yet from the total signal and then

00:06:24.819 --> 00:06:27.149 
from yet from the total signal and then
the<00:06:24.939> singer<00:06:25.270> or<00:06:25.509> whoever's<00:06:26.080> in<00:06:26.259> front<00:06:26.949> of<00:06:27.069> the

00:06:27.149 --> 00:06:27.159 
the singer or whoever's in front of the

00:06:27.159 --> 00:06:28.740 
the singer or whoever's in front of the
monitor<00:06:27.370> is<00:06:27.639> going<00:06:27.789> to<00:06:27.849> say<00:06:28.029> hey<00:06:28.240> would<00:06:28.479> you<00:06:28.539> do

00:06:28.740 --> 00:06:28.750 
monitor is going to say hey would you do

00:06:28.750 --> 00:06:30.450 
monitor is going to say hey would you do
turn<00:06:29.020> down<00:06:29.169> the<00:06:29.289> volume<00:06:29.319> turn<00:06:29.740> it<00:06:29.860> back<00:06:29.979> up<00:06:30.219> and

00:06:30.450 --> 00:06:30.460 
turn down the volume turn it back up and

00:06:30.460 --> 00:06:32.399 
turn down the volume turn it back up and
then<00:06:30.729> you<00:06:30.879> run<00:06:31.599> out<00:06:31.629> of<00:06:31.750> headroom<00:06:32.020> pretty

00:06:32.399 --> 00:06:32.409 
then you run out of headroom pretty

00:06:32.409 --> 00:06:35.459 
then you run out of headroom pretty
quick<00:06:32.680> so<00:06:33.460> that<00:06:34.000> is<00:06:34.210> the<00:06:34.719> only<00:06:34.839> drawback<00:06:35.050> with

00:06:35.459 --> 00:06:35.469 
quick so that is the only drawback with

00:06:35.469 --> 00:06:38.309 
quick so that is the only drawback with
having<00:06:35.740> a<00:06:35.800> tube<00:06:35.830> of<00:06:36.159> 15<00:06:36.639> I<00:06:36.990> usually<00:06:37.990> use<00:06:38.139> this

00:06:38.309 --> 00:06:38.319 
having a tube of 15 I usually use this

00:06:38.319 --> 00:06:40.830 
having a tube of 15 I usually use this
