Herbie<00:00:47.190> is<00:00:47.370> inside<00:00:47.760> and<00:00:48.090> what<00:00:48.420> makes<00:00:48.629> him<00:00:48.780> a

00:00:48.860 --> 00:00:48.870 
Herbie is inside and what makes him a

00:00:48.870 --> 00:00:50.450 
Herbie is inside and what makes him a
little<00:00:48.960> bit<00:00:49.200> different<00:00:49.590> is<00:00:49.680> that<00:00:50.129> he<00:00:50.309> is<00:00:50.430> a

00:00:50.450 --> 00:00:50.460 
little bit different is that he is a

light<00:00:50.940> seeking<00:00:51.780> robot<00:00:52.410> we'll<00:00:52.949> show<00:00:53.129> you<00:00:53.160> how

00:00:53.330 --> 00:00:53.340 
light seeking robot we'll show you how

00:00:53.340 --> 00:00:55.250 
light seeking robot we'll show you how
that<00:00:53.550> works<00:00:53.789> later<00:00:54.120> remove<00:00:54.840> everything<00:00:55.110> from

00:00:55.250 --> 00:00:55.260 
that works later remove everything from

00:00:55.260 --> 00:00:57.080 
that works later remove everything from
the<00:00:55.379> package<00:00:55.800> and<00:00:55.920> separate<00:00:56.370> all<00:00:56.399> the<00:00:56.760> parts

00:00:57.080 --> 00:00:57.090 
the package and separate all the parts

00:00:57.090 --> 00:00:59.029 
the package and separate all the parts
and<00:00:57.239> the<00:00:57.930> first<00:00:57.960> step<00:00:58.350> is<00:00:58.500> to<00:00:58.590> actually

00:00:59.029 --> 00:00:59.039 
and the first step is to actually

00:00:59.039 --> 00:01:01.639 
and the first step is to actually
separate<00:00:59.670> the<00:00:59.730> main<00:01:00.180> body<00:01:00.629> of<00:01:00.809> Herbie<00:01:01.500> the

00:01:01.639 --> 00:01:01.649 
separate the main body of Herbie the

00:01:01.649 --> 00:01:04.009 
separate the main body of Herbie the
mouse<00:01:01.829> bot<00:01:02.129> these<00:01:02.370> just<00:01:02.640> snap<00:01:02.910> apart<00:01:03.300> and<00:01:03.510> then

00:01:04.009 --> 00:01:04.019 
mouse bot these just snap apart and then

00:01:04.019 --> 00:01:06.560 
mouse bot these just snap apart and then
the<00:01:04.140> little<00:01:04.379> tabs<00:01:04.650> get<00:01:04.949> filed<00:01:05.309> down<00:01:05.670> you<00:01:06.420> may

00:01:06.560 --> 00:01:06.570 
the little tabs get filed down you may

00:01:06.570 --> 00:01:08.359 
the little tabs get filed down you may
be<00:01:06.630> wondering<00:01:07.049> how<00:01:07.080> Herbie<00:01:07.619> is<00:01:07.740> going<00:01:07.979> to<00:01:08.070> see

00:01:08.359 --> 00:01:08.369 
be wondering how Herbie is going to see

00:01:08.369 --> 00:01:10.730 
be wondering how Herbie is going to see
the<00:01:08.549> light<00:01:08.760> well<00:01:09.390> it's<00:01:09.720> his<00:01:09.930> eyes<00:01:10.200> these

00:01:10.730 --> 00:01:10.740 
the light well it's his eyes these

00:01:10.740 --> 00:01:12.980 
the light well it's his eyes these
infrared<00:01:11.220> sensors<00:01:11.850> their<00:01:12.119> photo<00:01:12.360> diodes<00:01:12.840> and

00:01:12.980 --> 00:01:12.990 
infrared sensors their photo diodes and

00:01:12.990 --> 00:01:14.539 
infrared sensors their photo diodes and
they<00:01:13.200> need<00:01:13.409> to<00:01:13.500> be<00:01:13.590> installed<00:01:13.710> in<00:01:14.159> the<00:01:14.310> board

00:01:14.539 --> 00:01:14.549 
they need to be installed in the board

00:01:14.549 --> 00:01:16.130 
they need to be installed in the board
and<00:01:14.850> then<00:01:15.000> we're<00:01:15.180> gonna<00:01:15.299> tin<00:01:15.600> all<00:01:15.840> the

00:01:16.130 --> 00:01:16.140 
and then we're gonna tin all the

00:01:16.140 --> 00:01:17.780 
and then we're gonna tin all the
connections<00:01:16.619> that<00:01:16.740> actually<00:01:17.189> put<00:01:17.400> the<00:01:17.549> board

00:01:17.780 --> 00:01:17.790 
connections that actually put the board

00:01:17.790 --> 00:01:19.520 
connections that actually put the board
together<00:01:18.030> be<00:01:18.450> careful<00:01:18.479> doing<00:01:19.110> this<00:01:19.229> and<00:01:19.409> make

00:01:19.520 --> 00:01:19.530 
together be careful doing this and make

00:01:19.530 --> 00:01:21.289 
together be careful doing this and make
sure<00:01:19.560> it's<00:01:19.830> lined<00:01:20.100> up<00:01:20.310> properly<00:01:20.369> it's

00:01:21.289 --> 00:01:21.299 
sure it's lined up properly it's

00:01:21.299 --> 00:01:23.149 
sure it's lined up properly it's
recommended<00:01:21.840> to<00:01:21.869> use<00:01:22.020> masking<00:01:22.470> tape<00:01:22.530> to<00:01:22.740> hold

00:01:23.149 --> 00:01:23.159 
recommended to use masking tape to hold

00:01:23.159 --> 00:01:25.010 
recommended to use masking tape to hold
everything<00:01:23.460> together<00:01:23.729> until<00:01:24.150> all<00:01:24.450> the<00:01:24.780> solder

00:01:25.010 --> 00:01:25.020 
everything together until all the solder

00:01:25.020 --> 00:01:27.080 
everything together until all the solder
joints<00:01:25.470> are<00:01:25.619> lined<00:01:25.830> up<00:01:26.070> that'll<00:01:26.640> be<00:01:26.759> soldering

00:01:27.080 --> 00:01:27.090 
joints are lined up that'll be soldering

00:01:27.090 --> 00:01:28.670 
joints are lined up that'll be soldering
in<00:01:27.270> the<00:01:27.330> relay<00:01:27.659> which<00:01:27.869> controls<00:01:28.290> Herbie's

00:01:28.670 --> 00:01:28.680 
in the relay which controls Herbie's

00:01:28.680 --> 00:01:30.890 
in the relay which controls Herbie's
forward<00:01:29.070> and<00:01:29.220> backward<00:01:29.640> movement<00:01:29.880> the<00:01:30.689> eight

00:01:37.130 --> 00:01:37.140 
transistor and switch now Herbie's tail

00:01:37.140 --> 00:01:38.630 
transistor and switch now Herbie's tail
is<00:01:37.350> very<00:01:37.530> important<00:01:37.979> because<00:01:38.070> it<00:01:38.310> controls

00:01:38.630 --> 00:01:38.640 
is very important because it controls

00:01:38.640 --> 00:01:40.760 
is very important because it controls
the<00:01:38.939> back<00:01:39.210> up<00:01:39.450> mechanism<00:01:40.079> of<00:01:40.200> Herbie<00:01:40.500> so<00:01:40.680> we

00:01:40.760 --> 00:01:40.770 
the back up mechanism of Herbie so we

00:01:40.770 --> 00:01:42.740 
the back up mechanism of Herbie so we
want<00:01:40.950> to<00:01:41.040> solder<00:01:41.280> that<00:01:41.400> in<00:01:41.700> place<00:01:41.939> use<00:01:42.329> a<00:01:42.360> lot

00:01:42.740 --> 00:01:42.750 
want to solder that in place use a lot

00:01:42.750 --> 00:01:44.749 
want to solder that in place use a lot
of<00:01:42.780> solder<00:01:43.200> to<00:01:43.380> hold<00:01:43.560> this<00:01:43.649> together<00:01:43.829> the<00:01:44.549> tail

00:01:44.749 --> 00:01:44.759 
of solder to hold this together the tail

00:01:50.420 --> 00:01:50.430 
cut and bent to look like this be sure

00:01:50.430 --> 00:01:51.740 
cut and bent to look like this be sure
to<00:01:50.579> save<00:01:50.759> the<00:01:50.880> extra<00:01:51.210> pieces<00:01:51.600> to<00:01:51.720> that

00:01:51.740 --> 00:01:51.750 
to save the extra pieces to that

00:01:51.750 --> 00:01:53.210 
to save the extra pieces to that
paperclip<00:01:52.350> because<00:01:52.380> you're<00:01:52.829> going<00:01:53.040> to<00:01:53.100> need

00:01:53.210 --> 00:01:53.220 
paperclip because you're going to need

00:01:53.220 --> 00:01:54.920 
paperclip because you're going to need
them<00:01:53.340> in<00:01:53.430> a<00:01:53.520> minute<00:01:53.640> then<00:01:54.240> that<00:01:54.420> gets<00:01:54.570> soldered

00:01:54.920 --> 00:01:54.930 
them in a minute then that gets soldered
