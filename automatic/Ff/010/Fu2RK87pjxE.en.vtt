00:00:00.990 --> 00:00:06.500
 Well today I'm going to show you how to do 

00:00:03.629 --> 00:00:10.320
 a restaurant for our dolls 

00:00:06.500 --> 00:00:12.209
 for this we are going to need a box of 

00:00:10.320 --> 00:00:14.730
 egg that I just bought in the 

00:00:12.209 --> 00:00:16.530
 grocery store from time to time 

00:00:14.730 --> 00:00:19.170
 you can get there preferably that 

00:00:16.530 --> 00:00:21.150
 be egg now you will measure if your 

00:00:19.170 --> 00:00:23.100
 doll fits inside 

00:00:21.150 --> 00:00:24.830
 and the materials I'll leave in the 

00:00:23.100 --> 00:00:27.590
 description 

00:00:24.830 --> 00:00:30.830
 well as they see in all my box they fit 

00:00:27.590 --> 00:00:34.190
 all my dolls then over there 

00:00:30.830 --> 00:00:36.800
 we have our classroom and now 

00:00:34.190 --> 00:00:40.250
 we will make this restaurant good we are going to 

00:00:36.800 --> 00:00:43.040
 cut the part from here to the front and the 

00:00:40.250 --> 00:00:45.110
 parts that you have here in our box and 

00:00:43.040 --> 00:00:48.090
 try to keep all that cardboard because 

00:00:45.110 --> 00:00:50.170
 we may use it a lot 

00:00:48.090 --> 00:00:55.120
 well now 

00:00:50.170 --> 00:00:58.750
 I decided to have my boxes and now do 

00:00:55.120 --> 00:01:01.030
 move the part of here and I recommend you 

00:00:58.750 --> 00:01:03.190
 better to have it like that so you do not have to 

00:01:01.030 --> 00:01:05.830
 spend more paper 

00:01:03.190 --> 00:01:08.110
 well and now we're just going to leave the 

00:01:05.830 --> 00:01:12.250
 other pieces of cardboard that will take us out and 

00:01:08.110 --> 00:01:14.340
 Now you are going to cover it to your liking with 

00:01:12.250 --> 00:01:17.789
 paper 

00:01:14.340 --> 00:01:19.259
 Well, before doing that, we're going to 

00:01:17.789 --> 00:01:21.600
 do the strong ones so that our 

00:01:19.259 --> 00:01:24.270
 dolls can have somewhere by 

00:01:21.600 --> 00:01:26.369
 where to peek out why that door does not 

00:01:24.270 --> 00:01:28.049
 I want I do not want the truth itself 

00:01:26.369 --> 00:01:30.000
 that you are going to mark a door with your 

00:01:28.049 --> 00:01:32.189
 Barbie doll because if it has its headquarters 

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:33.450
 our food I recommend you 

00:01:32.189 --> 00:01:35.369
 best is the barbie that is most holy 

00:01:33.450 --> 00:01:37.530
 those then you are going to draw the door 

00:01:35.369 --> 00:01:40.890
 to your liking you can even leave a 

00:01:37.530 --> 00:01:43.439
 window is if you want and with a marker 

00:01:40.890 --> 00:01:45.790
 black runs anything and then the 

00:01:43.439 --> 00:01:49.030
 you are going to cut 

00:01:45.790 --> 00:01:51.790
 that's it, I gave myself to my doll without her- 

00:01:49.030 --> 00:01:55.210
 to form it 

00:01:51.790 --> 00:01:57.580
 short and now if you have plastic 

00:01:55.210 --> 00:02:00.250
 some doll's package you're going to 

00:01:57.580 --> 00:02:03.730
 use to form the door and with 

00:02:00.250 --> 00:02:07.440
 tape or with or with silicone that you 

00:02:03.730 --> 00:02:07.440
 I recommend more the tape you are going to paste 

00:02:07.640 --> 00:02:12.950
 and I already hit the door from plastic 

00:02:10.009 --> 00:02:15.140
 as you see now what I'm going to do is 

00:02:12.950 --> 00:02:17.690
 erase all my box inside 

00:02:15.140 --> 00:02:19.900
 only inside with the paper that you 

00:02:17.690 --> 00:02:24.780
 want 

00:02:19.900 --> 00:02:26.560
 well now I'm going to cover my floor 

00:02:24.780 --> 00:02:28.480
 remember that you can not use your 

00:02:26.560 --> 00:02:30.220
 preference I wanted it to fulfill so 

00:02:28.480 --> 00:02:31.830
 then now you are going to heal nothing else 

00:02:30.220 --> 00:02:34.920
 ground 

00:02:31.830 --> 00:02:37.140
 also covers the outside 

00:02:34.920 --> 00:02:40.380
 something like this video cover the floors and 

00:02:37.140 --> 00:02:42.930
 some parts of the walls and I 

00:02:40.380 --> 00:02:45.480
 I put a handle so that the same 

00:02:42.930 --> 00:02:47.610
 coherent the door does not open now what 

00:02:45.480 --> 00:02:52.350
 that should be add a small here 

00:02:47.610 --> 00:02:55.210
 counter and a few tables over here 

00:02:52.350 --> 00:02:58.800
 and add a few chairs 

00:02:55.210 --> 00:02:58.800
 from the mind like six months 

00:03:00.109 --> 00:03:05.609
 and then we're going to cut two rectangles 

00:03:02.790 --> 00:03:09.930
 small ones of the same size that arrive so 

00:03:05.609 --> 00:03:11.690
 even a little more in the middle of your 

00:03:09.930 --> 00:03:14.780
 square 

00:03:11.690 --> 00:03:18.740
 and what were these two already stuck with 

00:03:14.780 --> 00:03:21.360
 white paper and this cardboard base 

00:03:18.740 --> 00:03:26.480
 and then based on running your mind you 

00:03:21.360 --> 00:03:26.480
 taste and then this one you're going to paste 

00:03:29.040 --> 00:03:32.040
 ah 

00:03:33.650 --> 00:03:36.340
 so 

00:03:36.350 --> 00:03:41.750
 to do more and more 

00:03:42.030 --> 00:03:46.560
 I already is running my restaurant ay 

00:03:44.610 --> 00:03:50.459
 how they see take the two chairs nap 

00:03:46.560 --> 00:03:53.250
 hunter huntsman and so on and because then 

00:03:50.459 --> 00:03:54.900
 with or only one seat and here 

00:03:53.250 --> 00:03:58.470
 also because he has thought about putting one 

00:03:54.900 --> 00:04:01.050
 but with I grab you the space then 

00:03:58.470 --> 00:04:03.510
 that will be for the two boyfriends will be for 

00:04:01.050 --> 00:04:05.430
 a person and it will be for a drink 

00:04:03.510 --> 00:04:08.100
 One pass and here was the counter 

00:04:05.430 --> 00:04:10.670
 so I show you how I stay by 

00:04:08.100 --> 00:04:10.670
 inside clear 

00:04:10.850 --> 00:04:16.100
 now I'm going to show you how to be successful 

00:04:13.260 --> 00:04:16.100
 register 

00:04:17.200 --> 00:04:21.910
 cut out our template from the 

00:04:20.320 --> 00:04:23.530
 small screen of the cash register that 

00:04:21.910 --> 00:04:27.220
 will be on our page 

00:04:23.530 --> 00:04:31.390
 web and cut out the three are pretty a 

00:04:27.220 --> 00:04:34.090
 little bigger than little screen 2 

00:04:31.390 --> 00:04:36.220
 to make the base appointment one for the 

00:04:34.090 --> 00:04:38.440
 screen and this little rectangle that 

00:04:36.220 --> 00:04:40.870
 will be pasted here so the screen 

00:04:38.440 --> 00:04:42.250
 can be attached to the cash register and 

00:04:40.870 --> 00:04:44.740
 these two are going to stick together 

00:04:42.250 --> 00:04:46.810
 we must cover with white paper this one 

00:04:44.740 --> 00:04:48.550
 he is also the lonely as the white and 

00:04:46.810 --> 00:04:51.060
 that you will also meet only with paper 

00:04:48.550 --> 00:04:51.060

00:04:57.140 --> 00:04:59.800
 our website 

00:05:00.180 --> 00:05:05.689
 piece of the room slimmer because the 

00:05:02.669 --> 00:05:07.689
 two other bowling successes 

00:05:05.689 --> 00:05:09.089
 together for 

00:05:07.689 --> 00:05:15.119
 to be the base of the cash register 

00:05:09.089 --> 00:05:15.119
 and find thinner is to do it 

00:05:18.930 --> 00:05:25.370
 now you are going to form your rest in a box 

00:05:22.800 --> 00:05:25.370

00:05:36.490 --> 00:05:40.599
 so that from here they were able to grab 

00:05:38.500 --> 00:05:43.229
 the receipt but nothing else should be placed 

00:05:40.599 --> 00:05:43.229
