whole idea behind bonsly rich x-files is

00:03:58.790 --> 00:04:00.400 
whole idea behind bonsly rich x-files is
about<00:03:59.060> leaving<00:03:59.420> the<00:03:59.540> earth<00:03:59.570> because<00:04:00.170> we've

00:04:07.120 --> 00:04:07.130 
not too much about a space cops uh but

00:04:07.130 --> 00:04:08.740 
not too much about a space cops uh but
it'sit's<00:04:07.430> civilization<00:04:08.150> in<00:04:08.240> space<00:04:08.480> it's<00:04:08.690> a

00:04:08.740 --> 00:04:08.750 
it'sit's civilization in space it's a

00:04:08.750 --> 00:04:12.280 
it'sit's civilization in space it's a
new<00:04:10.000> exactly<00:04:11.000> in<00:04:11.090> this<00:04:11.240> one<00:04:11.480> it's<00:04:11.750> the<00:04:11.990> same

00:04:12.280 --> 00:04:12.290 
new exactly in this one it's the same

00:04:12.290 --> 00:04:14.770 
new exactly in this one it's the same
team<00:04:12.890> like<00:04:13.430> a<00:04:13.460> large<00:04:13.850> amount<00:04:14.210> of<00:04:14.300> is<00:04:14.420> the<00:04:14.600> same

00:04:14.770 --> 00:04:14.780 
team like a large amount of is the same

00:04:14.780 --> 00:04:17.050 
team like a large amount of is the same
team<00:04:14.930> that<00:04:14.990> worked<00:04:15.260> on<00:04:15.350> the<00:04:15.470> original<00:04:16.060> the

00:04:17.050 --> 00:04:17.060 
team that worked on the original the

00:04:17.060 --> 00:04:18.520 
team that worked on the original the
reason<00:04:17.329> it's<00:04:17.450> not<00:04:17.570> called<00:04:17.870> alpha<00:04:18.140> Centauri's

00:04:18.520 --> 00:04:18.530 
reason it's not called alpha Centauri's

00:04:18.530 --> 00:04:21.220 
reason it's not called alpha Centauri's
because<00:04:18.739> EA<00:04:18.950> owns<00:04:19.310> the<00:04:19.609> name<00:04:19.790> oh<00:04:20.000> really<00:04:20.269> so

00:04:21.220 --> 00:04:21.230 
because EA owns the name oh really so

00:04:21.230 --> 00:04:22.930 
because EA owns the name oh really so
this<00:04:21.380> is<00:04:21.410> just<00:04:21.709> a<00:04:21.920> spiritual<00:04:22.400> successor<00:04:22.610> to

00:04:22.930 --> 00:04:22.940 
this is just a spiritual successor to

00:04:22.940 --> 00:04:28.090 
this is just a spiritual successor to
Alpha<00:04:23.210> Centauri<00:04:24.430> and<00:04:26.560> it's<00:04:27.560> gonna<00:04:27.680> have<00:04:27.860> tech

00:04:28.090 --> 00:04:28.100 
Alpha Centauri and it's gonna have tech

00:04:28.100 --> 00:04:31.690 
Alpha Centauri and it's gonna have tech
trees<00:04:28.460> you<00:04:28.850> can't<00:04:29.230> you<00:04:30.230> can't<00:04:30.500> go<00:04:30.770> it's<00:04:31.460> got<00:04:31.670> a

00:04:31.690 --> 00:04:31.700 
trees you can't you can't go it's got a

00:04:31.700 --> 00:04:33.850 
trees you can't you can't go it's got a
tech<00:04:31.940> web<00:04:32.180> nut<00:04:32.450> trees<00:04:32.780> so<00:04:33.020> you<00:04:33.110> have<00:04:33.350> to<00:04:33.470> go<00:04:33.620> one

00:04:33.850 --> 00:04:33.860 
tech web nut trees so you have to go one

00:04:33.860 --> 00:04:35.650 
tech web nut trees so you have to go one
direction<00:04:33.980> or<00:04:34.340> the<00:04:34.430> other<00:04:34.490> your<00:04:35.180> society

00:04:37.990 --> 00:04:38.000 
can't concentrate on like I guess it

00:04:38.000 --> 00:04:40.060 
can't concentrate on like I guess it
could<00:04:38.240> but<00:04:38.540> it's<00:04:38.660> gonna<00:04:39.140> it<00:04:39.500> would<00:04:39.590> be<00:04:39.710> weak<00:04:39.919> in

00:04:40.060 --> 00:04:40.070 
could but it's gonna it would be weak in
