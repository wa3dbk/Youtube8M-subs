operation<00:01:00.449> so<00:01:00.840> the<00:01:01.079> new<00:01:01.260> procedure<00:01:01.710> what<00:01:02.370> we

00:01:02.479 --> 00:01:02.489 
operation so the new procedure what we

00:01:02.489 --> 00:01:04.640 
operation so the new procedure what we
call<00:01:02.670> transcatheter<00:01:03.350> aortic<00:01:04.350> valve

00:01:04.640 --> 00:01:04.650

implantation is put this valve on a
little<00:01:07.799> Catherine<00:01:08.250> so<00:01:08.850> we<00:01:09.150> will<00:01:09.210> crimp<00:01:09.659> this

00:01:09.890 --> 00:01:09.900 
little Catherine so we will crimp this

00:01:15.410 --> 00:01:15.420 
quarter to about six millimeters which

00:01:15.420 --> 00:01:18.289 
quarter to about six millimeters which
is<00:01:15.600> about<00:01:16.409> an<00:01:16.650> eighth<00:01:16.799> of<00:01:16.830> an<00:01:17.280> inch<00:01:17.400> and<00:01:17.729> then

00:01:18.289 --> 00:01:18.299 
is about an eighth of an inch and then

00:01:18.299 --> 00:01:20.240 
is about an eighth of an inch and then
insert<00:01:18.720> that<00:01:18.869> catheter<00:01:19.350> through<00:01:19.619> the<00:01:19.710> leg<00:01:20.070> or

00:01:20.240 --> 00:01:20.250 
insert that catheter through the leg or

00:01:20.250 --> 00:01:23.240 
insert that catheter through the leg or
through<00:01:20.549> the<00:01:20.700> chest<00:01:20.939> and<00:01:21.439> position<00:01:22.439> it<00:01:22.619> into

00:01:23.240 --> 00:01:23.250 
through the chest and position it into

00:01:23.250 --> 00:01:25.370 
through the chest and position it into
the<00:01:23.549> old<00:01:23.700> bow<00:01:23.909> while<00:01:24.840> the<00:01:24.990> heart<00:01:25.140> is<00:01:25.229> still

00:01:25.370 --> 00:01:25.380 
the old bow while the heart is still

00:01:25.380 --> 00:01:27.260 
the old bow while the heart is still
beating<00:01:25.530> then<00:01:25.920> we<00:01:26.070> inflate<00:01:26.430> the<00:01:26.729> balloon<00:01:27.030> and

00:01:27.260 --> 00:01:27.270 
beating then we inflate the balloon and

00:01:27.270 --> 00:01:30.140 
beating then we inflate the balloon and
that<00:01:27.780> stretches<00:01:28.650> this<00:01:28.860> metal<00:01:29.220> tube<00:01:29.490> or<00:01:29.790> stent

00:01:30.140 --> 00:01:30.150 
that stretches this metal tube or stent

00:01:30.150 --> 00:01:33.319 
that stretches this metal tube or stent
out<00:01:31.020> and<00:01:31.470> it's<00:01:31.650> pushes<00:01:32.189> up<00:01:32.310> the<00:01:32.460> old<00:01:32.640> valve<00:01:32.970> and

00:01:33.319 --> 00:01:33.329 
out and it's pushes up the old valve and

00:01:33.329 --> 00:01:35.420 
out and it's pushes up the old valve and
creates<00:01:33.630> a<00:01:33.780> new<00:01:33.930> passageway<00:01:34.409> for<00:01:34.619> blood<00:01:35.070> to

ah breathing like normal again it was

00:02:42.670 --> 00:02:46.119 
ah breathing like normal again it was
unbelievable<00:02:43.670> I<00:02:43.909> mean<00:02:44.120> it<00:02:44.930> was<00:02:45.019> a<00:02:45.079> cakewalk<00:02:45.530> I

00:02:46.119 --> 00:02:46.129 
unbelievable I mean it was a cakewalk I

00:02:46.129 --> 00:02:48.550 
unbelievable I mean it was a cakewalk I
mean<00:02:46.340> I<00:02:46.400> went<00:02:46.640> in<00:02:46.819> and<00:02:46.849> all<00:02:47.780> of<00:02:48.109> a<00:02:48.170> sudden<00:02:48.470> I'm

00:02:48.550 --> 00:02:48.560 
mean I went in and all of a sudden I'm

00:02:48.560 --> 00:02:50.680 
mean I went in and all of a sudden I'm
walking<00:02:48.950> out<00:02:49.069> the<00:02:49.220> door<00:02:49.250> again<00:02:49.819> with<00:02:49.970> it<00:02:50.120> what

00:02:50.680 --> 00:02:50.690 
walking out the door again with it what

00:02:50.690 --> 00:02:53.110 
walking out the door again with it what
happened<00:02:51.079> in<00:02:51.200> the<00:02:51.319> intervening<00:02:52.120> interviewers

00:02:53.110 --> 00:02:53.120 
happened in the intervening interviewers

00:02:53.120 --> 00:02:54.520 
happened in the intervening interviewers
I<00:02:53.329> think<00:02:53.540> the<00:02:53.629> greatest<00:02:53.870> and<00:02:54.200> most<00:02:54.290> obvious

00:02:54.520 --> 00:02:54.530 
I think the greatest and most obvious

00:02:54.530 --> 00:02:56.890 
I think the greatest and most obvious
difference<00:02:55.310> is<00:02:56.030> that<00:02:56.060> the<00:02:56.420> patients<00:02:56.780> do<00:02:56.870> not

00:02:56.890 --> 00:02:56.900 
difference is that the patients do not

00:02:56.900 --> 00:02:59.229 
difference is that the patients do not
require<00:02:57.349> a<00:02:57.620> sternotomy<00:02:58.010> or<00:02:58.459> our<00:02:58.790> chest

00:02:59.229 --> 00:02:59.239 
require a sternotomy or our chest

00:02:59.239 --> 00:03:02.379 
require a sternotomy or our chest
incision<00:02:59.629> that's<00:03:00.049> a<00:03:00.139> big<00:03:00.650> advantage<00:03:00.799> and<00:03:01.430> also

00:03:02.379 --> 00:03:02.389 
incision that's a big advantage and also

00:03:02.389 --> 00:03:04.899 
incision that's a big advantage and also
their<00:03:02.510> ability<00:03:02.900> to<00:03:02.930> recover<00:03:03.859> and<00:03:04.310> regain

00:03:04.899 --> 00:03:04.909 
their ability to recover and regain

00:03:04.909 --> 00:03:07.509 
their ability to recover and regain
activity<00:03:05.629> i<00:03:05.659> think<00:03:06.139> is<00:03:06.349> quickened<00:03:06.920> in<00:03:07.129> the

00:03:07.509 --> 00:03:07.519 
activity i think is quickened in the

00:03:07.519 --> 00:03:09.009 
activity i think is quickened in the
patients<00:03:07.909> that<00:03:07.970> receive<00:03:08.329> the<00:03:08.450> transformer

00:03:09.009 --> 00:03:09.019 
patients that receive the transformer

00:03:09.019 --> 00:03:10.990 
patients that receive the transformer
allow<00:03:09.260> i<00:03:09.560> think<00:03:09.980> it's<00:03:10.099> a<00:03:10.190> fair<00:03:10.310> assessment<00:03:10.609> to

00:03:10.990 --> 00:03:11.000 
allow i think it's a fair assessment to

00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:12.309 
allow i think it's a fair assessment to
say<00:03:11.180> that<00:03:11.389> that<00:03:11.569> we've<00:03:11.750> been<00:03:11.870> able<00:03:11.989> to

00:03:12.309 --> 00:03:12.319 
say that that we've been able to

00:03:12.319 --> 00:03:14.710 
say that that we've been able to
certainly<00:03:12.799> maintain<00:03:13.549> if<00:03:13.819> not<00:03:14.299> maybe<00:03:14.480> even

certainly maintain if not maybe even

00:03:14.720 --> 00:03:16.210 
certainly maintain if not maybe even

when<00:03:48.260> you<00:03:48.379> compare<00:03:48.829> sort<00:03:49.069> of<00:03:49.160> the<00:03:49.250> risk<00:03:49.519> to

00:03:49.780 --> 00:03:49.790 
when you compare sort of the risk to

00:03:49.790 --> 00:03:52.270 
when you compare sort of the risk to
doing<00:03:50.269> nothing<00:03:50.449> these<00:03:51.260> patients<00:03:51.829> you<00:03:52.220> know

00:03:52.270 --> 00:03:52.280 
doing nothing these patients you know

00:03:52.280 --> 00:03:54.280 
doing nothing these patients you know
we'll<00:03:52.489> go<00:03:52.639> on<00:03:52.910> to<00:03:53.090> die<00:03:53.329> with<00:03:53.690> if<00:03:53.840> they<00:03:53.959> have<00:03:54.109> no

00:03:54.280 --> 00:03:54.290 
we'll go on to die with if they have no

00:03:54.290 --> 00:03:56.649 
we'll go on to die with if they have no
treatment<00:03:54.829> still<00:03:55.519> this<00:03:55.730> is<00:03:55.790> an<00:03:56.120> experimental

00:03:56.649 --> 00:03:56.659 
treatment still this is an experimental

00:03:56.659 --> 00:03:58.869 
treatment still this is an experimental
approach<00:03:57.169> we<00:03:57.650> think<00:03:57.919> this<00:03:58.040> will<00:03:58.280> eventually

00:03:58.869 --> 00:03:58.879 
approach we think this will eventually

00:03:58.879 --> 00:04:01.119 
approach we think this will eventually
become<00:03:59.120> available<00:03:59.629> commercially<00:04:00.409> currently

00:04:01.119 --> 00:04:01.129 
become available commercially currently

00:04:01.129 --> 00:04:03.039 
become available commercially currently
at<00:04:01.250> this<00:04:01.400> time<00:04:01.669> it's<00:04:01.909> still<00:04:02.120> only<00:04:02.359> available

00:04:03.039 --> 00:04:03.049 
at this time it's still only available

00:04:03.049 --> 00:04:05.530 
at this time it's still only available
in<00:04:03.169> the<00:04:03.230> United<00:04:03.530> States<00:04:03.620> through<00:04:04.209> the<00:04:05.209> trial

in the United States through the trial
for<00:04:06.049> a<00:04:06.079> patient<00:04:06.290> that<00:04:06.530> currently<00:04:06.889> this

00:04:07.059 --> 00:04:07.069 
for a patient that currently this

for a patient that currently this
condition<00:04:07.579> the<00:04:07.909> FDA<00:04:08.180> allow<00:04:08.419> us<00:04:08.540> to<00:04:08.659> continue

00:04:08.979 --> 00:04:08.989 
condition the FDA allow us to continue

00:04:08.989 --> 00:04:11.379 
condition the FDA allow us to continue
to<00:04:09.260> do<00:04:09.409> some<00:04:09.590> of<00:04:09.620> this<00:04:09.919> procedure<00:04:10.669> at<00:04:11.030> the<00:04:11.209> same

00:04:11.379 --> 00:04:11.389 
to do some of this procedure at the same

00:04:11.389 --> 00:04:13.089 
to do some of this procedure at the same
time<00:04:11.540> there's<00:04:11.750> a<00:04:11.840> new<00:04:11.870> trial<00:04:12.290> coming<00:04:12.680> up<00:04:12.859> as

00:04:13.089 --> 00:04:13.099 
time there's a new trial coming up as

00:04:13.099 --> 00:04:15.729 
time there's a new trial coming up as
well<00:04:13.340> called<00:04:13.669> partner<00:04:14.000> to<00:04:14.209> which<00:04:14.870> allow<00:04:15.440> us<00:04:15.470> to

00:04:15.729 --> 00:04:15.739 
well called partner to which allow us to

00:04:15.739 --> 00:04:17.560 
well called partner to which allow us to
use<00:04:15.769> smaller<00:04:16.250> catheter<00:04:16.789> the<00:04:17.060> newer

00:04:17.560 --> 00:04:17.570 
use smaller catheter the newer

00:04:17.570 --> 00:04:19.810 
use smaller catheter the newer
generation<00:04:18.229> to<00:04:18.530> treat<00:04:18.889> the<00:04:19.130> same<00:04:19.370> condition

00:04:19.810 --> 00:04:19.820 
generation to treat the same condition

00:04:19.820 --> 00:04:22.420 
generation to treat the same condition
as<00:04:19.909> well<00:04:20.150> it<00:04:20.510> is<00:04:20.719> a<00:04:20.750> major<00:04:21.320> medical<00:04:21.799> paradigm

00:04:22.420 --> 00:04:22.430 
as well it is a major medical paradigm

00:04:22.430 --> 00:04:24.220 
as well it is a major medical paradigm
shift<00:04:23.000> the<00:04:23.240> only<00:04:23.389> thing<00:04:23.630> that<00:04:23.780> rival

00:04:24.220 --> 00:04:24.230 
shift the only thing that rival

00:04:24.230 --> 00:04:26.500 
shift the only thing that rival
this<00:04:24.530> in<00:04:24.770> terms<00:04:25.010> of<00:04:25.280> that<00:04:25.520> it's<00:04:26.120> powerful

00:04:26.500 --> 00:04:26.510 
this in terms of that it's powerful

00:04:26.510 --> 00:04:28.270 
this in terms of that it's powerful
impact<00:04:27.050> on<00:04:27.320> patients<00:04:27.950> is<00:04:28.100> heart

00:04:28.270 --> 00:04:28.280

impact on patients is heart
transplantation<00:04:29.090> in<00:04:29.980> 1968<00:04:30.980> so<00:04:31.370> we<00:04:31.550> see<00:04:31.730> this

00:04:31.750 --> 00:04:31.760 
transplantation in 1968 so we see this

00:04:31.760 --> 00:04:35.230 
transplantation in 1968 so we see this
as<00:04:32.120> a<00:04:32.150> major<00:04:32.860> step<00:04:33.860> forward<00:04:34.220> there's<00:04:34.970> still<00:04:35.180> a

00:04:35.230 --> 00:04:35.240 
as a major step forward there's still a

00:04:35.240 --> 00:04:38.170 
as a major step forward there's still a
lot<00:04:35.510> to<00:04:35.540> be<00:04:35.810> learned<00:04:36.160> but<00:04:37.160> it's<00:04:37.340> we<00:04:37.670> can<00:04:37.880> offer

00:04:38.170 --> 00:04:38.180 
lot to be learned but it's we can offer

00:04:38.180 --> 00:04:40.090 
lot to be learned but it's we can offer
patients<00:04:38.600> something<00:04:39.260> we<00:04:39.380> never<00:04:39.560> could<00:04:39.920> before

00:04:40.090 --> 00:04:40.100 
patients something we never could before

00:04:40.100 --> 00:04:42.970 
patients something we never could before
and<00:04:41.030> that's<00:04:41.480> pretty<00:04:41.720> exciting<00:04:42.140> you<00:04:42.560> can't

00:04:42.970 --> 00:04:42.980 
and that's pretty exciting you can't

00:04:42.980 --> 00:04:45.610 
and that's pretty exciting you can't
believe<00:04:43.310> it<00:04:43.490> it's<00:04:43.720> it's<00:04:44.720> only<00:04:45.140> been<00:04:45.320> since

00:04:45.610 --> 00:04:45.620 
believe it it's it's only been since

00:04:45.620 --> 00:04:49.060 
believe it it's it's only been since
August<00:04:46.400> ninth<00:04:46.850> I<00:04:47.120> guess<00:04:47.360> yeah<00:04:48.050> he's<00:04:48.620> like

00:04:49.060 --> 00:04:49.070 
August ninth I guess yeah he's like

00:04:49.070 --> 00:04:52.300 
August ninth I guess yeah he's like
