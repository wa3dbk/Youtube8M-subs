I'm<00:00:59.739> Freight<00:01:00.010> in<00:01:00.280> the<00:01:00.340> brake<00:01:00.640> lever<00:01:00.879> is

00:01:01.170 --> 00:01:01.180 
I'm Freight in the brake lever is

00:01:01.180 --> 00:01:02.759 
I'm Freight in the brake lever is
painted<00:01:01.600> red<00:01:01.750> so<00:01:02.170> everyone<00:01:02.530> knows<00:01:02.710> that

painted red so everyone knows that

00:01:02.769 --> 00:01:04.830 
painted red so everyone knows that
that's<00:01:03.070> the<00:01:03.280> pedal<00:01:03.550> to<00:01:03.579> stop<00:01:03.940> the<00:01:04.480> CVT

00:01:04.830 --> 00:01:04.840

it also has four-wheel hydraulic disc
brakes<00:01:25.510> which<00:01:26.260> don't<00:01:26.560> take<00:01:26.740> a<00:01:26.770> lot<00:01:26.860> of

00:01:27.030 --> 00:01:27.040 
brakes which don't take a lot of

brakes which don't take a lot of
pressure<00:01:27.250> to<00:01:27.490> get<00:01:27.640> a<00:01:27.820> reaction<00:01:28.240> from<00:01:28.450> so<00:01:29.200> for

00:01:29.670 --> 00:01:29.680 
pressure to get a reaction from so for

00:01:29.680 --> 00:01:31.320 
pressure to get a reaction from so for
these<00:01:29.800> young<00:01:29.980> children<00:01:30.010> they<00:01:30.820> can<00:01:31.000> just<00:01:31.180> put

00:01:32.640 --> 00:01:32.650 
the foot on the brake and they get the

00:01:32.650 --> 00:01:33.630 
the foot on the brake and they get the
reaction<00:01:32.980> that<00:01:33.010> they're<00:01:33.190> looking<00:01:33.310> for

00:01:33.630 --> 00:01:33.640 
reaction that they're looking for

00:01:33.640 --> 00:01:42.820 
reaction that they're looking for
without<00:01:33.730> having<00:01:34.150> to<00:01:34.270> add<00:01:34.450> too<00:01:34.960> much<00:01:35.080> it
