00:00:00.810 --> 00:00:03.650
 Hello 

00:00:03.940 --> 00:00:07.569
 welcome to the first video review or 

00:00:05.950 --> 00:00:09.219
 video analysis as some will have 

00:00:07.569 --> 00:00:11.139
 included we premiered with the drawing 

00:00:09.219 --> 00:00:12.639
 English for the miserable however 

00:00:11.139 --> 00:00:14.680
 before getting in , we went to see a 

00:00:12.639 --> 00:00:16.119
 small fragment of the trailer that stops 

00:00:14.680 --> 00:00:19.710
 What are we going to fool me we will help 

00:00:16.119 --> 00:00:19.710
 increase the final duration of the video 

00:00:23.670 --> 00:00:26.570
 I'm cold 

00:00:28.060 --> 00:00:32.490
 I know who you are, you are jean valjean 

00:00:42.210 --> 00:00:45.260
 or false 

00:00:46.880 --> 00:00:51.190
 good girl scram 

00:00:52.550 --> 00:00:56.559
 there is no goal with one of them 

00:00:56.579 --> 00:00:59.940
 although we are analyzing the edition 

00:00:58.379 --> 00:01:02.100
 English also serves for the Spanish 

00:00:59.940 --> 00:01:03.750
 since they are exactly the same 

00:01:02.100 --> 00:01:05.460
 exception of the Spanish one that brings a 

00:01:03.750 --> 00:01:07.320
 disco with the highlights of the band 

00:01:05.460 --> 00:01:10.290
 sound of the film the finish of the 

00:01:07.320 --> 00:01:11.399
 book is good is robust all the 

00:01:10.290 --> 00:01:13.409
 feeling that it's made with 

00:01:11.399 --> 00:01:16.680
 bad materials as happened to us with the 

00:01:13.409 --> 00:01:20.689
 American edition of the hobbit and in addition 

00:01:16.680 --> 00:01:20.689
 This digibook is thinner than others 

00:01:26.220 --> 00:01:31.590
 after 26 color pages with photos of the 

00:01:28.620 --> 00:01:33.600
 characters and phrases of their songs 

00:01:31.590 --> 00:01:37.310
 the text is in English and I imagine that the 

00:01:33.600 --> 00:01:37.310
 Spanish edition will be exactly the same 

00:01:40.170 --> 00:01:45.730
 the image format 185 what he wants 

00:01:43.720 --> 00:01:48.580
 say that he does not have black bands and in 

00:01:45.730 --> 00:01:49.960
 how much audio does castellano dts 5.1 bring 

00:01:48.580 --> 00:01:51.730
 Well nothing here you have my little 

00:01:49.960 --> 00:01:53.530
 musical collection the soundtrack 

00:01:51.730 --> 00:01:55.000
 the win in a contest of universal 

00:01:53.530 --> 00:01:57.760
 If I had not, I would never have bought it 

00:01:55.000 --> 00:01:59.560
 not come complete and also the disk of 

00:01:57.760 --> 00:02:01.750
 the songs of the Spanish cast of 

00:01:59.560 --> 00:02:03.460
 When I went to see him in 2010, I only have left 

00:02:01.750 --> 00:02:04.990
 thank you I know it's a video 

00:02:03.460 --> 00:02:07.690
 very shallow analysis a video 

00:02:04.990 --> 00:02:09.550
 short but you will start to have support and 

00:02:07.690 --> 00:02:11.530
 you'll like it could make it bigger and 

00:02:09.550 --> 00:02:13.710
 with more requirements thank you very much 

00:02:11.530 --> 00:02:13.710
 new 

00:02:17.620 --> 00:02:19.680
 to
