pencil sorry and place your pencil on
the<00:01:20.960> tip<00:01:21.110> of<00:01:21.229> the<00:01:21.350> compass<00:01:24.940> like<00:01:25.940> this

00:01:27.940 --> 00:01:27.950 
the tip of the compass like this

00:01:27.950 --> 00:01:31.380 
the tip of the compass like this
so<00:01:28.430> first<00:01:28.700> of<00:01:28.820> all<00:01:28.940> you<00:01:29.900> gotta<00:01:30.110> start<00:01:30.350> off<00:01:30.620> with

00:01:31.380 --> 00:01:31.390 
so first of all you gotta start off with

00:01:31.390 --> 00:01:34.960 
so first of all you gotta start off with
making<00:01:32.390> a<00:01:32.509> circle<00:01:33.280> specifically<00:01:34.280> no<00:01:34.490> specific

00:01:34.960 --> 00:01:34.970 
making a circle specifically no specific

00:01:34.970 --> 00:01:36.370 
making a circle specifically no specific
size<00:01:35.180> you<00:01:35.330> can<00:01:35.479> make<00:01:35.630> it<00:01:35.780> big<00:01:35.960> you<00:01:36.080> can<00:01:36.229> make<00:01:36.259> a

00:01:36.370 --> 00:01:36.380 
size you can make it big you can make a

00:01:36.380 --> 00:01:44.050 
size you can make it big you can make a
small<00:01:37.509> make<00:01:38.509> a<00:01:38.540> circle<00:01:38.930> like<00:01:39.020> this<00:01:42.700> all<00:01:43.700> right

00:01:44.050 --> 00:01:44.060 
small make a circle like this all right

00:01:44.060 --> 00:01:46.210 
small make a circle like this all right
you<00:01:44.810> have<00:01:44.960> a<00:01:44.990> circle<00:01:45.350> now<00:01:45.770> what<00:01:46.040> you're<00:01:46.160> gonna

00:01:46.210 --> 00:01:46.220 
you have a circle now what you're gonna

00:01:46.220 --> 00:01:51.580 
you have a circle now what you're gonna
do<00:01:46.430> is<00:01:46.780> keep<00:01:47.780> the<00:01:48.460> compass<00:01:49.460> has<00:01:50.320> the<00:01:51.320> same

00:01:51.580 --> 00:01:51.590 
do is keep the compass has the same

00:01:51.590 --> 00:01:54.730 
do is keep the compass has the same
length<00:01:52.220> as<00:01:52.520> you<00:01:53.450> made<00:01:53.600> the<00:01:53.750> circle<00:01:54.080> do<00:01:54.290> not<00:01:54.470> do

00:01:54.730 --> 00:01:54.740 
length as you made the circle do not do

00:01:54.740 --> 00:01:59.260 
length as you made the circle do not do
not<00:01:54.770> move<00:01:55.100> it<00:01:55.310> okay<00:01:55.460> and<00:01:55.850> just<00:01:56.200> just<00:01:58.030> mark<00:01:59.030> the

00:01:59.260 --> 00:01:59.270 
not move it okay and just just mark the

00:01:59.270 --> 00:02:04.359 
not move it okay and just just mark the
midpoint<00:02:00.399> okay<00:02:01.399> so<00:02:02.149> put<00:02:03.140> the<00:02:03.170> compass<00:02:03.710> on<00:02:04.009> any

00:02:04.359 --> 00:02:04.369 
midpoint okay so put the compass on any

00:02:04.369 --> 00:02:09.760 
midpoint okay so put the compass on any
part<00:02:04.700> of<00:02:04.789> the<00:02:04.910> circle<00:02:06.039> okay<00:02:07.039> and<00:02:08.319> grow<00:02:09.319> a<00:02:09.350> curve

00:02:09.760 --> 00:02:09.770 
part of the circle okay and grow a curve

00:02:09.770 --> 00:02:15.070 
part of the circle okay and grow a curve
such<00:02:10.610> that<00:02:11.050> it<00:02:12.340> passes<00:02:13.340> the<00:02:13.700> middle<00:02:14.030> of<00:02:14.840> the

00:02:15.070 --> 00:02:15.080 
such that it passes the middle of the

00:02:15.080 --> 00:02:20.260 
such that it passes the middle of the
circle<00:02:15.440> right<00:02:16.690> it's<00:02:17.690> so<00:02:17.959> simple<00:02:18.200> now<00:02:19.120> move<00:02:20.120> it

00:02:20.260 --> 00:02:20.270 
circle right it's so simple now move it

00:02:20.270 --> 00:02:22.630 
circle right it's so simple now move it
from<00:02:20.390> this<00:02:20.510> position<00:02:20.959> and<00:02:21.260> put<00:02:21.860> it<00:02:21.950> to<00:02:22.069> one<00:02:22.490> of

00:02:22.630 --> 00:02:22.640 
from this position and put it to one of

00:02:22.640 --> 00:02:27.070 
from this position and put it to one of
the<00:02:22.760> end<00:02:22.910> of<00:02:23.030> the<00:02:23.120> curves<00:02:24.280> put<00:02:25.280> here<00:02:25.520> and<00:02:26.420> draw

00:02:27.070 --> 00:02:27.080 
the end of the curves put here and draw

00:02:27.080 --> 00:02:29.040 
the end of the curves put here and draw
the<00:02:27.140> line<00:02:27.380> similarly<00:02:27.890> then<00:02:28.640> it<00:02:28.760> passes

00:02:29.040 --> 00:02:29.050 
the line similarly then it passes

00:02:29.050 --> 00:02:35.590 
the line similarly then it passes
through<00:02:30.050> the<00:02:30.230> center<00:02:32.140> right<00:02:33.140> and<00:02:34.060> again<00:02:35.060> the

00:02:35.590 --> 00:02:35.600 
through the center right and again the

00:02:35.600 --> 00:02:37.930 
through the center right and again the
same<00:02:35.840> put<00:02:36.410> on<00:02:36.950> any<00:02:37.160> point<00:02:37.459> you<00:02:37.550> can<00:02:37.700> put<00:02:37.850> it

00:02:37.930 --> 00:02:37.940 
same put on any point you can put it

00:02:37.940 --> 00:02:42.340 
same put on any point you can put it
even<00:02:38.090> here<00:02:38.330> here<00:02:38.660> and<00:02:40.300> draw<00:02:41.300> a<00:02:41.330> curve<00:02:41.690> such

00:02:42.340 --> 00:02:42.350 
even here here and draw a curve such

00:02:42.350 --> 00:02:47.220 
even here here and draw a curve such
that<00:02:42.380> it<00:02:42.709> passes<00:02:42.980> the<00:02:43.250> center

00:02:47.220 --> 00:02:47.230 

00:02:47.230 --> 00:03:02.630 

again<00:02:48.069> here<00:02:48.629> it's<00:02:49.629> the<00:02:49.959> same<00:02:58.620> again<00:02:59.620> same<00:03:01.050> and

00:03:02.630 --> 00:03:02.640 
again here it's the same again same and

00:03:02.640 --> 00:03:07.910 
again here it's the same again same and
we're<00:03:03.640> done<00:03:04.470> this<00:03:05.470> is<00:03:05.709> the<00:03:06.069> simplest<00:03:06.519> circle

00:03:07.910 --> 00:03:07.920 
we're done this is the simplest circle

00:03:07.920 --> 00:03:11.580 
we're done this is the simplest circle
flower<00:03:09.360> circular<00:03:10.360> flower<00:03:10.660> curve<00:03:10.959> you<00:03:11.560> can

00:03:11.580 --> 00:03:11.590 
flower circular flower curve you can

00:03:11.590 --> 00:03:14.430 
flower circular flower curve you can
make<00:03:11.890> with<00:03:12.069> a<00:03:12.099> compass<00:03:12.580> you<00:03:13.569> can<00:03:13.630> even<00:03:13.989> design

00:03:14.430 --> 00:03:14.440 
make with a compass you can even design

00:03:14.440 --> 00:03:17.280 
make with a compass you can even design
it<00:03:14.799> now<00:03:14.950> like<00:03:15.400> put<00:03:15.640> colors<00:03:15.970> on<00:03:16.000> it<00:03:16.299> and<00:03:17.049> put

00:03:17.280 --> 00:03:17.290 
it now like put colors on it and put

simple now even if you want color it so
I<00:03:39.610> when<00:03:40.360> you<00:03:40.450> color<00:03:40.690> it<00:03:40.870> keep<00:03:41.380> the<00:03:41.560> length

00:03:41.759 --> 00:03:41.769 
I when you color it keep the length

00:03:41.769 --> 00:03:44.640 
I when you color it keep the length
again<00:03:42.069> the<00:03:42.610> same<00:03:42.880> okay<00:03:43.180> do<00:03:43.360> not<00:03:43.510> move<00:03:43.690> it<00:03:43.870> put

00:03:44.640 --> 00:03:44.650 
again the same okay do not move it put

00:03:44.650 --> 00:03:52.620 
again the same okay do not move it put
the<00:03:45.090> color<00:03:46.090> pencil<00:03:46.480> down<00:03:46.599> here<00:03:51.359> put<00:03:52.359> it<00:03:52.450> on<00:03:52.540> the

the<00:04:16.660> coloring<00:04:17.019> but<00:04:17.889> it<00:04:18.459> will<00:04:18.579> not<00:04:18.729> be<00:04:18.789> that

00:04:19.199 --> 00:04:19.209 
the coloring but it will not be that

00:04:19.209 --> 00:04:24.719 
the coloring but it will not be that
neat<00:04:19.889> so<00:04:21.990> like<00:04:22.990> this<00:04:23.169> again<00:04:24.039> you<00:04:24.190> do<00:04:24.340> the<00:04:24.460> same
