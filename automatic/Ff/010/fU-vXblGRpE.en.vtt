then I'll stop using it for the next
three<00:06:33.960> days<00:06:35.750> so<00:06:37.700> this<00:06:38.700> is<00:06:38.910> my<00:06:39.750> ear<00:06:39.990> challenge

00:06:41.350 --> 00:06:41.360 
three days so this is my ear challenge

00:06:41.360 --> 00:06:50.510 
three days so this is my ear challenge
begin<00:06:42.390> and<00:06:46.040> let's<00:06:47.040> I<00:06:48.470> am<00:06:49.470> open<00:06:49.950> that<00:06:50.100> I<00:06:50.130> get<00:06:50.400> the

00:06:50.510 --> 00:06:50.520 
begin and let's I am open that I get the

00:06:50.520 --> 00:06:52.550 
begin and let's I am open that I get the
result<00:06:50.850> that<00:06:50.880> I'm<00:06:51.120> looking<00:06:51.450> for<00:06:51.690> which<00:06:52.530> is

00:06:52.550 --> 00:06:52.560 
result that I'm looking for which is

00:06:52.560 --> 00:06:57.020 
result that I'm looking for which is
growing<00:06:53.160> back<00:06:53.310> my<00:06:53.490> edges<00:06:54.860> are<00:06:55.860> a<00:06:56.460> bit<00:06:56.790> more

00:06:57.020 --> 00:06:57.030 
growing back my edges are a bit more

00:06:57.030 --> 00:07:00.050 
growing back my edges are a bit more
density<00:06:57.600> here<00:06:58.530> is<00:06:58.740> there<00:06:59.070> but<00:06:59.280> it's<00:06:59.460> very<00:06:59.520> thin

00:07:00.050 --> 00:07:00.060 
density here is there but it's very thin

00:07:00.060 --> 00:07:03.350 
density here is there but it's very thin
so<00:07:00.650> I'm<00:07:01.650> hoping<00:07:02.250> that<00:07:02.490> it<00:07:02.670> gets<00:07:02.790> a<00:07:02.940> more<00:07:03.090> dense

00:07:03.350 --> 00:07:03.360 
so I'm hoping that it gets a more dense

00:07:03.360 --> 00:07:07.400 
so I'm hoping that it gets a more dense
City<00:07:04.140> and<00:07:04.850> all<00:07:05.850> the<00:07:06.090> hairs<00:07:06.360> that<00:07:06.630> are<00:07:06.690> down<00:07:07.050> in

00:07:07.400 --> 00:07:07.410 
City and all the hairs that are down in

00:07:07.410 --> 00:07:13.220 
City and all the hairs that are down in
there<00:07:08.060> pops<00:07:09.060> up<00:07:09.530> so<00:07:11.210> my<00:07:12.210> hair<00:07:12.480> come<00:07:12.720> back<00:07:12.930> to

00:07:13.220 --> 00:07:13.230 
there pops up so my hair come back to

00:07:13.230 --> 00:07:16.010 
there pops up so my hair come back to
the<00:07:14.190> thickness<00:07:14.460> that<00:07:14.940> it<00:07:15.090> was<00:07:15.330> I<00:07:15.600> didn't

00:07:16.010 --> 00:07:16.020 
the thickness that it was I didn't

00:07:16.020 --> 00:07:18.650 
the thickness that it was I didn't
really<00:07:16.260> have<00:07:16.410> thick<00:07:16.770> hair<00:07:16.800> but<00:07:17.430> it<00:07:18.300> wasn't

00:07:18.650 --> 00:07:18.660 
really have thick hair but it wasn't

00:07:18.660 --> 00:07:22.100 
really have thick hair but it wasn't
this<00:07:18.870> thing<00:07:19.350> either<00:07:19.860> I<00:07:20.400> guess<00:07:20.970> from<00:07:21.300> using<00:07:21.900> a

00:07:22.100 --> 00:07:22.110 
this thing either I guess from using a

00:07:22.110 --> 00:07:25.400 
this thing either I guess from using a
