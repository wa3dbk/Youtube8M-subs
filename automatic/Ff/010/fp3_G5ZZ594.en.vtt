00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.310
 hello everyone and welcome to practical in 

00:00:03.330 --> 00:00:08.580
 the tutorial of now I'm going to teach you 

00:00:05.310 --> 00:00:11.790
 One way is super easy how to do 

00:00:08.580 --> 00:00:15.120
 a remove enamel we are going to need a 

00:00:11.790 --> 00:00:18.600
 small glass boat with its respective 

00:00:15.120 --> 00:00:22.070
 lid or we can also recycle one that 

00:00:18.600 --> 00:00:24.689
 be a little plastic sponge 

00:00:22.070 --> 00:00:28.140
 any squad that you have of the 

00:00:24.689 --> 00:00:32.369
 they use to wash dishes like this 

00:00:28.140 --> 00:00:37.219
 that brings good to your area 

00:00:32.369 --> 00:00:37.219
 scissors and hands to the work 

00:00:37.340 --> 00:00:52.460
 and measure the sponge next to the bottle and 

00:00:40.970 --> 00:00:53.330
 cut what's left of the second step with the 

00:00:52.460 --> 00:00:55.820
 index finger 

00:00:53.330 --> 00:00:59.590
 you have to place it in the middle of the 

00:00:55.820 --> 00:00:59.590
 sponge and then roll up 

00:01:02.070 --> 00:01:08.760
 if you see that a single sponge does not fill 

00:01:04.979 --> 00:01:11.340
 all the boat you have to use two or the 

00:01:08.760 --> 00:01:13.850
 that are necessary according to the size of the 

00:01:11.340 --> 00:01:13.850
 flask 

00:01:20.260 --> 00:01:25.610
 remember to recycle what's left over from 

00:01:22.700 --> 00:01:27.740
 You can use sponges to apply 

00:01:25.610 --> 00:01:30.520
 paint or glue on other 

00:01:27.740 --> 00:01:30.520
 Crafts 

00:01:40.870 --> 00:01:49.380
 with a toothpick or pencil you have to do 

00:01:44.410 --> 00:01:49.380
 a hole in the center of the sponges 

00:01:51.380 --> 00:01:55.329
 and then add the nail polish remover 

00:01:58.100 --> 00:02:03.950
 the measurement depends on the size of the 

00:02:01.500 --> 00:02:03.950
 glass 

00:02:21.840 --> 00:02:23.930
 ah 

00:02:29.630 --> 00:02:33.350
 i 

00:02:31.430 --> 00:02:35.920
 i 

00:02:33.350 --> 00:02:35.920
 two 

00:02:50.109 --> 00:02:56.659
 Now just enter one finger at a time 

00:02:53.109 --> 00:03:00.790
 turning it around and you'll see how in seconds 

00:02:56.659 --> 00:03:00.790
 the enamel disappears 

00:03:01.319 --> 00:03:07.349
 you just need to customize the boat me 

00:03:04.560 --> 00:03:10.980
 use acrylic paint in black color to 

00:03:07.349 --> 00:03:13.249
 the lid and a circle of any paper 

00:03:10.980 --> 00:03:17.519
 also stickers forming the word 

00:03:13.249 --> 00:03:19.799
 mommy and I added a ribbon to me 

00:03:17.519 --> 00:03:22.260
 I really like this project 1 because it is 

00:03:19.799 --> 00:03:25.549
 economic you do it at home and you're 

00:03:22.260 --> 00:03:28.079
 saving from not going to the store and paying 

00:03:25.549 --> 00:03:30.510
 enough money for something you do not 

00:03:28.079 --> 00:03:32.280
 you can do for yourself and since you 

00:03:30.510 --> 00:03:35.760
 about mothers day too 

00:03:32.280 --> 00:03:38.310
 It would be a very nice detail from you 

00:03:35.760 --> 00:03:40.949
 that you give one to your mom so you can 

00:03:38.310 --> 00:03:42.810
 make one for you one for a friend and 

00:03:40.949 --> 00:03:46.319
 one for your mom I hope you like it
