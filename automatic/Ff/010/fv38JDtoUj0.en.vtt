00:00:03.290 --> 00:00:06.620
 hello I am myriad of the workshop 

00:00:05.879 --> 00:00:09.570
 cooked 

00:00:06.620 --> 00:00:12.990
 we are going to make small today 

00:00:09.570 --> 00:00:16.590
 jars of cream quickly made just with 

00:00:12.990 --> 00:00:21.480
 egg yolk milk and a very small 

00:00:16.590 --> 00:00:22.740
 little agar agar powder is actually 

00:00:21.480 --> 00:00:23.449
 is a recipe that is made in five 

00:00:22.740 --> 00:00:27.210
 minutes 

00:00:23.449 --> 00:00:30.029
 so we broke 2nd which we kept 

00:00:27.210 --> 00:00:35.520
 yellow we take the sugar we go to whiten 

00:00:30.029 --> 00:00:41.550
 that until his re- becoming 

00:00:35.520 --> 00:00:45.510
 white meanwhile we're going to do 

00:00:41.550 --> 00:00:48.980
 hot it's a liter of milk since there 

00:00:45.510 --> 00:00:48.980
 that's what's left in the bottle 

00:00:49.579 --> 00:00:59.780
 before heating up we'll diluted 

00:00:55.430 --> 00:01:02.600
 to 50 centilitres of eastern gramat 

00:00:59.780 --> 00:01:04.680
 agar agar 

00:01:02.600 --> 00:01:06.840
 so in fact it's a recipe I have 

00:01:04.680 --> 00:01:09.570
 always saw my grandmother the iron with 

00:01:06.840 --> 00:01:11.729
 the apple seeds she kept and 

00:01:09.570 --> 00:01:13.170
 who are the pectin is good now 

00:01:11.729 --> 00:01:15.509
 it will be a little bit long keep all 

00:01:13.170 --> 00:01:18.570
 pips and agar agar fills very 

00:01:15.509 --> 00:01:22.070
 well rolls so you put a 

00:01:18.570 --> 00:01:28.350
 teaspoon which represents 2 g 

00:01:22.070 --> 00:01:32.189
 well filled daguerre look we 're going 

00:01:28.350 --> 00:01:38.490
 put on fire it's the system in 

00:01:32.189 --> 00:01:39.600
 stupidly makes custard and the 

00:01:38.490 --> 00:01:41.369
 pastry cream to say that we whiten 

00:01:39.600 --> 00:01:42.720
 egg yolks with sugar on 

00:01:41.369 --> 00:01:43.380
 pour the boiling milk we go the 

00:01:42.720 --> 00:01:45.540
 reset 

00:01:43.380 --> 00:01:47.640
 I would say have heated up to boiling 

00:01:45.540 --> 00:01:50.280
 and then poured into small pots 

00:01:47.640 --> 00:01:53.220
 it is allowed to cool in refugees and it is 

00:01:50.280 --> 00:01:59.549
 finished so see the yellows are good 

00:01:53.220 --> 00:02:01.790
 white we will pour the milk in one 

00:01:59.549 --> 00:02:01.790
 time 

00:02:02.890 --> 00:02:21.170
 beating well we add chocolate on 

00:02:14.750 --> 00:02:22.940
 put back in the pan and put back 

00:02:21.170 --> 00:02:25.010
 until heated up to boiling 

00:02:22.940 --> 00:02:29.300
 so now we have reached 

00:02:25.010 --> 00:02:33.320
 the evolution actually the station to station is going to get 

00:02:29.300 --> 00:02:36.680
 check while cooling we will pour 

00:02:33.320 --> 00:02:39.670
 that in small ramekins or 

00:02:36.680 --> 00:02:39.670
 little pots like that old fashioned 

00:02:53.050 --> 00:02:57.730
 in twenty meters in the fridge offers saas 

00:02:55.120 --> 00:02:59.800
 and deposits you can put do 

00:02:57.730 --> 00:03:01.120
 the day before and all that is kept handles 

00:02:59.800 --> 00:03:04.960
 several days in the fridge is not there 

00:03:01.120 --> 00:03:08.550
 it's really me it's 

00:03:04.960 --> 00:03:08.550
 this is the cream of my childhood
