00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.259
 hello my name is will monday 

00:00:01.770 --> 00:00:06.629
 long-awaited book purchases come 

00:00:04.259 --> 00:00:09.059
 it is today and I have today for you 

00:00:06.629 --> 00:00:11.099
 5 books to have something too 

00:00:09.059 --> 00:00:13.049
 A lot of purchase chick happened so I 

00:00:11.099 --> 00:00:15.120
 I want to break into several videos wait 

00:00:13.049 --> 00:00:17.130
 continuation in the near future 

00:00:15.120 --> 00:00:19.289
 let's start with the book that I have 

00:00:17.130 --> 00:00:22.020
 top pocketbook series 

00:00:19.289 --> 00:00:23.970
 this is a ring figure don't let me go you 

00:00:22.020 --> 00:00:26.369
 probably know that I already read this 

00:00:23.970 --> 00:00:28.019
 book and I really liked it but 

00:00:26.369 --> 00:00:30.449
 still a paper copy to me too 

00:00:28.019 --> 00:00:33.059
 I wanted to buy even later 

00:00:30.449 --> 00:00:35.040
 such a long time after reading 

00:00:33.059 --> 00:00:36.600
 still this book should be on my 

00:00:35.040 --> 00:00:38.370
 shelf at any cost 

00:00:36.600 --> 00:00:40.590
 I think everything you need to know about this 

00:00:38.370 --> 00:00:42.840
 book what is the story about the future this 

00:00:40.590 --> 00:00:45.750
 the story of people about what it is to be 

00:00:42.840 --> 00:00:47.670
 a man and in general who is a man like 

00:00:45.750 --> 00:00:49.230
 determine a person or not you have 

00:00:47.670 --> 00:00:51.750
 soul or not here codes 

00:00:49.230 --> 00:00:53.309
 such serious questions but in 

00:00:51.750 --> 00:00:55.620
 enough entertaining form 

00:00:53.309 --> 00:00:57.719
 the end of the figures is a genius never get tired of it 

00:00:55.620 --> 00:01:00.059
 repeat therefore bought this book about 

00:00:57.719 --> 00:01:01.410
 I spoke to this book quite recently I 

00:01:00.059 --> 00:01:04.110
 Said I want to buy 

00:01:01.410 --> 00:01:06.689
 Of course, I bought it free and bottom 

00:01:04.110 --> 00:01:09.180
 salinger as you see very thin 

00:01:06.689 --> 00:01:12.210
 little book being I'll take too 

00:01:09.180 --> 00:01:13.920
 I'll take it to my book marathon not 

00:01:12.210 --> 00:01:16.710
 does it mean you are a book marathon all in 

00:01:13.920 --> 00:01:19.259
 I donâ€™t know what the description of this book is about 

00:01:16.710 --> 00:01:21.960
 I did not know about what over the precipice in the rye Gan 

00:01:19.259 --> 00:01:24.060
 started reading it and it seems to me the case with 

00:01:21.960 --> 00:01:25.320
 Jerome's purpose is generally not necessary 

00:01:24.060 --> 00:01:28.049
 know what the book is about 

00:01:25.320 --> 00:01:29.549
 I bought in the same design as he 

00:01:28.049 --> 00:01:31.650
 over the chasm in the rye which is to me 

00:01:29.549 --> 00:01:33.299
 gave will mess so they me 

00:01:31.650 --> 00:01:35.340
 will stand side by side and very beautiful 

00:01:33.299 --> 00:01:37.799
 combined for someone why it hurts I do not 

00:01:35.340 --> 00:01:40.799
 asked the next book you combined 

00:01:37.799 --> 00:01:42.869
 also probably already saw this chateau life 

00:01:40.799 --> 00:01:45.030
 before ilves author like three types i 

00:01:42.869 --> 00:01:47.790
 remembered this book we will read 

00:01:45.030 --> 00:01:50.820
 together with you and together with you within 

00:01:47.790 --> 00:01:52.740
 test project wii and i will send you 

00:01:50.820 --> 00:01:55.770
 link again to the video where i am 

00:01:52.740 --> 00:01:57.600
 telling the details like nothing with anyone 

00:01:55.770 --> 00:02:00.149
 but I don't know this 

00:01:57.600 --> 00:02:01.380
 cover to only a little confused such 

00:02:00.149 --> 00:02:04.140
 too girlish 

00:02:01.380 --> 00:02:05.880
 but the description just just hovered over 

00:02:04.140 --> 00:02:08.390
 a description of everything you take to me 

00:02:05.880 --> 00:02:11.550
 read it here our girls 

00:02:08.390 --> 00:02:13.860
 added in the annotation and 15 and 

00:02:11.550 --> 00:02:16.920
 the last 10 years she died was resurrected 

00:02:13.860 --> 00:02:19.920
 five times I understood from the annotations she had there 

00:02:16.920 --> 00:02:22.920
 there is some scientist who eyes time 

00:02:19.920 --> 00:02:25.050
 kills and began to live again and behold 

00:02:22.920 --> 00:02:27.209
 once she happens so she 

00:02:25.050 --> 00:02:29.069
 move to a new place and meet 

00:02:27.209 --> 00:02:31.800
 people that she would just like natu 

00:02:29.069 --> 00:02:33.599
 that is, do not die again from Odessa 

00:02:31.800 --> 00:02:36.720
 live with them 

00:02:33.599 --> 00:02:39.150
 his life is probably like there 

00:02:36.720 --> 00:02:41.640
 It will be very interesting to me because 

00:02:39.150 --> 00:02:44.069
 I have never read anything like this 

00:02:41.640 --> 00:02:46.379
 kind of cover on a little bit 

00:02:44.069 --> 00:02:48.660
 pumped up but still it seems to me there 

00:02:46.379 --> 00:02:51.780
 This is something interesting about the next book. 

00:02:48.660 --> 00:02:54.150
 you can scold me of course I don't know 

00:02:51.780 --> 00:02:56.250
 laugh at me i don't know what else 

00:02:54.150 --> 00:02:58.040
 you can do me myself did not expect 

00:02:56.250 --> 00:03:00.510
 what buy this book 

00:02:58.040 --> 00:03:02.519
 reasons that probably bought 

00:03:00.510 --> 00:03:03.269
 I'll tell you later when I will 

00:03:02.519 --> 00:03:04.860
 play a trick 

00:03:03.269 --> 00:03:06.870
 same book you all bought a few 

00:03:04.860 --> 00:03:09.450
 copies I bought it at the draw 

00:03:06.870 --> 00:03:11.580
 hem and why not buy one too 

00:03:09.450 --> 00:03:14.280
 although a strange choice actually 

00:03:11.580 --> 00:03:18.030
 strange i don't know blame love author 

00:03:14.280 --> 00:03:20.879
 we have atkins here you know this is a series where 

00:03:18.030 --> 00:03:22.250
 we are all guilty i love carrot and 

00:03:20.879 --> 00:03:25.799
 so on then I mean yes 

00:03:22.250 --> 00:03:28.409
 strange series let's say it happens there 

00:03:25.799 --> 00:03:30.750
 of course inside interesting nose books 

00:03:28.409 --> 00:03:33.180
 that here it is on top of it without any 

00:03:30.750 --> 00:03:35.489
 comments as they say i only 

00:03:33.180 --> 00:03:37.739
 read the annotation, I realized that it was possible 

00:03:35.489 --> 00:03:39.180
 this is exactly the case when inside 

00:03:37.739 --> 00:03:42.330
 better than outside 

00:03:39.180 --> 00:03:43.890
 about a girl who wakes up in one 

00:03:42.330 --> 00:03:45.989
 beautiful day and you understand that not all 

00:03:43.890 --> 00:03:48.780
 ideally this problems are solved that is how 

00:03:45.989 --> 00:03:50.700
 you, too, element fiction seems to me 

00:03:48.780 --> 00:03:52.799
 there will be something interesting too 

00:03:50.700 --> 00:03:54.750
 Of course I will read but I hardly 

00:03:52.799 --> 00:04:00.450
 I will go out and for that me 

00:03:54.750 --> 00:04:02.629
 just ashamed of the last very very 

00:04:00.450 --> 00:04:03.750
 long ago when i wanted nothing old-old 

00:04:02.629 --> 00:04:05.700
 registration 

00:04:03.750 --> 00:04:07.830
 Well, now I have bought already in cinema 

00:04:05.700 --> 00:04:10.650
 the cover because the movie is coming soon 

00:04:07.830 --> 00:04:13.620
 this is the seventh son or pupil of the magician as she 

00:04:10.650 --> 00:04:16.199
 called the previous edition of the target target 

00:04:13.620 --> 00:04:18.509
 soft gray is not that there is some 

00:04:16.199 --> 00:04:20.549
 several books of the series that is again 

00:04:18.509 --> 00:04:22.740
 family book don't know how about 

00:04:20.549 --> 00:04:24.650
 of the next books but here I am for sure 

00:04:22.740 --> 00:04:27.180
 I can read again the Swede 

00:04:24.650 --> 00:04:30.479
 faceted i'm just afraid open so 

00:04:27.180 --> 00:04:33.330
 I still crunches it just a huge font 

00:04:30.479 --> 00:04:35.070
 and I think that through this book you can 

00:04:33.330 --> 00:04:37.410
 wade very, very fast literally 

00:04:35.070 --> 00:04:39.060
 in one day but that's all for today 

00:04:37.410 --> 00:04:41.370
 write necessarily in the comments 

00:04:39.060 --> 00:04:43.560
 any books that i read 

00:04:41.370 --> 00:04:45.360
 I'll show you the rook I mentioned today 

00:04:43.560 --> 00:04:47.850
 maybe you want to read too 

00:04:45.360 --> 00:04:51.860
 some of these books but also for today 

00:04:47.850 --> 00:04:51.860
 that's all and i'm always yours
