clock and a calculator we can get more

00:00:11.969 --> 00:00:13.520 
clock and a calculator we can get more
widgets<00:00:12.330> just<00:00:12.389> by<00:00:12.690> simply<00:00:13.019> pressing<00:00:13.230> and

00:00:15.350 --> 00:00:15.360 
holding on any one of the widgets we've

00:00:15.360 --> 00:00:17.540 
holding on any one of the widgets we've
already<00:00:15.480> got<00:00:15.830> or<00:00:16.830> if<00:00:16.949> there's<00:00:17.130> no<00:00:17.250> widget<00:00:17.490> you

00:00:17.540 --> 00:00:17.550 
already got or if there's no widget you

00:00:17.550 --> 00:00:18.590 
already got or if there's no widget you
can<00:00:17.670> just<00:00:17.789> press<00:00:17.910> and<00:00:18.029> hold<00:00:18.090> on<00:00:18.270> the<00:00:18.359> screen

00:00:18.590 --> 00:00:18.600 
can just press and hold on the screen

00:00:18.600 --> 00:00:20.330 
can just press and hold on the screen
then<00:00:19.260> we<00:00:19.289> get<00:00:19.500> this<00:00:19.619> little<00:00:19.770> selection<00:00:20.160> or

00:00:20.330 --> 00:00:20.340 
then we get this little selection or

00:00:20.340 --> 00:00:22.130 
then we get this little selection or
widget<00:00:20.520> to<00:00:20.580> come<00:00:20.699> up<00:00:20.789> the<00:00:20.880> top<00:00:21.060> bottom<00:00:21.930> sorry

00:00:22.130 --> 00:00:22.140 
widget to come up the top bottom sorry

00:00:22.140 --> 00:00:23.929 
widget to come up the top bottom sorry
so<00:00:22.890> we<00:00:22.980> can<00:00:23.130> just<00:00:23.279> get<00:00:23.430> rid<00:00:23.550> of<00:00:23.640> the<00:00:23.730> clock

00:00:23.929 --> 00:00:23.939 
so we can just get rid of the clock

00:00:23.939 --> 00:00:26.359 
so we can just get rid of the clock
there<00:00:24.269> and<00:00:24.840> maybe<00:00:25.050> stick<00:00:25.380> up<00:00:25.590> say<00:00:25.830> a<00:00:25.859> calendar

00:00:26.359 --> 00:00:26.369 
there and maybe stick up say a calendar

00:00:26.369 --> 00:00:28.580 
there and maybe stick up say a calendar
instead<00:00:26.539> and<00:00:27.539> just<00:00:27.750> move<00:00:27.900> that<00:00:28.080> by<00:00:28.260> wherever

00:00:28.580 --> 00:00:28.590 
instead and just move that by wherever

00:00:28.590 --> 00:00:30.500 
instead and just move that by wherever
we<00:00:28.680> like<00:00:28.830> on<00:00:29.010> the<00:00:29.099> screen<00:00:29.369> so<00:00:30.240> this<00:00:30.330> fairly

00:00:30.500 --> 00:00:30.510 
we like on the screen so this fairly

00:00:30.510 --> 00:00:33.700 
we like on the screen so this fairly
easy<00:00:30.689> to<00:00:30.779> use<00:00:30.900> and<00:00:31.320> fairly<00:00:32.099> cool<00:00:32.880> little<00:00:33.030> menu

00:00:33.700 --> 00:00:33.710 
easy to use and fairly cool little menu

00:00:33.710 --> 00:00:35.600 
easy to use and fairly cool little menu
unfortunately<00:00:34.710> there's<00:00:34.860> not<00:00:34.950> many<00:00:35.100> widgets<00:00:35.370> I

00:00:35.600 --> 00:00:35.610 
unfortunately there's not many widgets I

00:00:35.610 --> 00:00:36.799 
unfortunately there's not many widgets I
just<00:00:35.790> bring<00:00:35.940> that<00:00:35.969> back<00:00:36.210> up<00:00:36.360> again<00:00:36.570> you<00:00:36.690> can

00:00:36.799 --> 00:00:36.809 
just bring that back up again you can

00:00:36.809 --> 00:00:38.959 
just bring that back up again you can
see<00:00:37.079> there's<00:00:37.290> not<00:00:37.559> exactly<00:00:38.219> a<00:00:38.550> particularly

00:00:38.959 --> 00:00:38.969 
see there's not exactly a particularly

00:00:38.969 --> 00:00:41.660 
see there's not exactly a particularly
huge<00:00:39.239> selection<00:00:39.750> of<00:00:39.840> widgets<00:00:40.260> and<00:00:40.520> I<00:00:41.520> don't

00:00:41.660 --> 00:00:41.670 
huge selection of widgets and I don't

00:00:41.670 --> 00:00:43.549 
huge selection of widgets and I don't
think<00:00:41.910> you<00:00:42.000> can<00:00:42.210> download<00:00:42.420> anymore<00:00:42.750> either<00:00:43.079> so

00:00:43.549 --> 00:00:43.559 
think you can download anymore either so

00:00:43.559 --> 00:00:45.799 
think you can download anymore either so
you're<00:00:44.160> fairly<00:00:44.399> stuck<00:00:45.270> with<00:00:45.420> what<00:00:45.570> you<00:00:45.660> can

00:00:45.799 --> 00:00:45.809 
you're fairly stuck with what you can

00:00:45.809 --> 00:00:49.790 
you're fairly stuck with what you can
use<00:00:46.140> in<00:00:46.770> terms<00:00:47.070> of<00:00:47.250> widgets<00:00:48.500> just<00:00:49.500> move<00:00:49.649> across

00:00:49.790 --> 00:00:49.800 
use in terms of widgets just move across

00:00:49.800 --> 00:00:52.459 
use in terms of widgets just move across
to<00:00:50.039> the<00:00:50.129> next<00:00:50.250> screen<00:00:50.579> now<00:00:50.879> once<00:00:51.840> the<00:00:52.020> contact

00:00:52.459 --> 00:00:52.469 
to the next screen now once the contact

00:00:52.469 --> 00:00:54.410 
to the next screen now once the contact
screen<00:00:52.649> and<00:00:53.520> on<00:00:53.610> the<00:00:53.699> contact<00:00:54.059> screen<00:00:54.149> we've

00:00:54.410 --> 00:00:54.420 
screen and on the contact screen we've

00:00:54.420 --> 00:00:55.869 
screen and on the contact screen we've
got<00:00:54.449> all<00:00:54.719> your<00:00:54.870> contact<00:00:55.320> images

00:00:55.869 --> 00:00:55.879 
got all your contact images

00:00:55.879 --> 00:00:58.010 
got all your contact images
unfortunately<00:00:56.879> the<00:00:57.090> Microsoft<00:00:57.660> ActiveSync

00:00:58.010 --> 00:00:58.020 
unfortunately the Microsoft ActiveSync

00:00:58.020 --> 00:00:59.900 
unfortunately the Microsoft ActiveSync
that<00:00:58.289> you<00:00:58.350> used<00:00:58.469> to<00:00:58.559> sync<00:00:58.800> the<00:00:58.859> context<00:00:59.520> hasn't

00:00:59.900 --> 00:00:59.910 
that you used to sync the context hasn't

00:00:59.910 --> 00:01:01.639 
that you used to sync the context hasn't
actually<00:01:00.390> syncs<00:01:00.840> any<00:01:01.050> of<00:01:01.170> the<00:01:01.230> contacts

00:01:01.639 --> 00:01:01.649 
actually syncs any of the contacts

00:01:01.649 --> 00:01:03.770 
actually syncs any of the contacts
images<00:01:02.039> so<00:01:02.850> you've<00:01:02.969> just<00:01:03.000> got<00:01:03.300> these<00:01:03.449> sort<00:01:03.750> of

00:01:03.770 --> 00:01:03.780 
images so you've just got these sort of

00:01:03.780 --> 00:01:07.070 
images so you've just got these sort of
standard<00:01:04.519> silhouettes<00:01:05.519> instead<00:01:06.000> also<00:01:06.930> the

00:01:07.070 --> 00:01:07.080 
standard silhouettes instead also the

00:01:07.080 --> 00:01:08.870 
standard silhouettes instead also the
active<00:01:07.350> synced<00:01:07.710> in<00:01:07.830> I<00:01:08.130> think<00:01:08.520> any<00:01:08.670> of<00:01:08.760> my

00:01:08.870 --> 00:01:08.880

00:03:21.950 --> 00:03:21.960 
to have taking it from the memory card

00:03:21.960 --> 00:03:24.590
