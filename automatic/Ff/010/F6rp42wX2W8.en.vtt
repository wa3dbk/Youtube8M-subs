00:00:00.319 --> 00:00:05.819
 so people I'm back with new ones 

00:00:03.389 --> 00:00:07.189
 Technique exercise and that time a bit 

00:00:05.819 --> 00:00:11.010
 sophisticated 

00:00:07.189 --> 00:00:12.900
 I present today the most demanding 

00:00:11.010 --> 00:00:14.250
 exercise I have shown you so far 

00:00:12.900 --> 00:00:15.719
 I 'll show you today 

00:00:14.250 --> 00:00:18.570
 and that is about the exercise today 

00:00:15.719 --> 00:00:19.980
 delfin canadian maybe there are people 

00:00:18.570 --> 00:00:21.480
 they may already know the exercise 

00:00:19.980 --> 00:00:23.609
 also under a different name 

00:00:21.480 --> 00:00:24.539
 Maybe every coach can do something 

00:00:23.609 --> 00:00:26.369
 to think of something else 

00:00:24.539 --> 00:00:27.539
 i will now declare the exercise course 

00:00:26.369 --> 00:00:28.590
 land and then I'll do it to you two 

00:00:27.539 --> 00:00:30.449
 long ago 

00:00:28.590 --> 00:00:33.329
 of course, the exercise now unites 

00:00:30.449 --> 00:00:35.730
 different aspects to each other 

00:00:33.329 --> 00:00:38.520
 one is a very coordinative one 

00:00:35.730 --> 00:00:40.340
 challenging exercise to another schulz 

00:00:38.520 --> 00:00:42.840
 also at the same time the rotation 

00:00:40.340 --> 00:00:43.850
 movement sequences the combination of 

00:00:42.840 --> 00:00:46.590
 lay 

00:00:43.850 --> 00:00:49.440
 and what am I doing now? 

00:00:46.590 --> 00:00:53.520
 In principle , it is always with me 

00:00:49.440 --> 00:00:56.059
 one arm to double it and that does 

00:00:53.520 --> 00:00:59.250
 always to be poor 

00:00:56.059 --> 00:01:01.859
 his back on the train then again one 

00:00:59.250 --> 00:01:05.280
 others a gray suit and an early one 

00:01:01.859 --> 00:01:06.030
 exactly to dismantle suit and one 

00:01:05.280 --> 00:01:07.950
 back at the train 

00:01:06.030 --> 00:01:11.610
 you see I red her here in the 

00:01:07.950 --> 00:01:15.330
 fall constantly with something about the longitudinal axis 

00:01:11.610 --> 00:01:16.920
 make my legs now in the two 

00:01:15.330 --> 00:01:18.290
 should we apply simultaneous 

00:01:16.920 --> 00:01:20.790
 make a beating 

00:01:18.290 --> 00:01:24.119
 most of them are likely 

00:01:20.790 --> 00:01:26.939
 on a foursome amts and 3 delfin 

00:01:24.119 --> 00:01:29.460
 kicks or from one side to the 

00:01:26.939 --> 00:01:31.380
 the other side of the biscuit just look 

00:01:29.460 --> 00:01:33.570
 with me as I combined the whole 

00:01:31.380 --> 00:01:35.579
 and trying to copy it is one 

00:01:33.570 --> 00:01:36.479
 really horny exercise as I said it trains 

00:01:35.579 --> 00:01:39.810
 the rotation 

00:01:36.479 --> 00:01:41.610
 it is extremely demanding and creative 

00:01:39.810 --> 00:01:43.920
 It is a combination of crawl 

00:01:41.610 --> 00:01:47.810
 back and dolphin swimming is watching 

00:01:43.920 --> 00:01:47.810
 but I try to do it right 

00:02:43.400 --> 00:02:48.620
 but I know I have with me 

00:02:45.230 --> 00:02:50.360
 Although I have always been informed by the 

00:02:48.620 --> 00:02:53.090
 one side on the other 

00:02:50.360 --> 00:02:55.790
 page it was 3d fx just look 

00:02:53.090 --> 00:02:57.620
 important is that it is just a non-stop 

00:02:55.790 --> 00:02:59.239
 uniform dolphin stroke becomes 

00:02:57.620 --> 00:03:00.950
 in the same way in the poor 

00:02:59.239 --> 00:03:03.769
 in that they always in gray and 

00:03:00.950 --> 00:03:06.140
 a back combined and around the 

00:03:03.769 --> 00:03:08.840
 you have rotated force around the longitudinal axis 

00:03:06.140 --> 00:03:11.329
 A non-stop footprint also pays attention 

00:03:08.840 --> 00:03:15.230
 the technical ganglia train 

00:03:11.329 --> 00:03:16.370
 phase pressure phase and very important friend 

00:03:15.230 --> 00:03:17.870
 forgot to say 

00:03:16.370 --> 00:03:21.230
 at this exercise have as always on 

00:03:17.870 --> 00:03:22.760
 put a diagonal tension what 

00:03:21.230 --> 00:03:26.239
 also very important for us 

00:03:22.760 --> 00:03:31.700
 is swimming around the 

00:03:26.239 --> 00:03:36.019
 longitudinal axis four tournaments a short 

00:03:31.700 --> 00:03:37.370
 time his diagonal tension important 

00:03:36.019 --> 00:03:38.450
 how I did it, taking care to 

00:03:37.370 --> 00:03:40.549
 do it better 

00:03:38.450 --> 00:03:43.150
 see you soon all dominik me thumbs 

00:03:40.549 --> 00:03:43.150
 high ciao
