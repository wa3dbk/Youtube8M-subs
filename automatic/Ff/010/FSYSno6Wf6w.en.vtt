00:00:00.150 --> 00:00:05.890
 and the epistle of the Apostle Saint Paul to 

00:00:02.430 --> 00:00:08.410
 'tito' chapter 1 

00:00:05.890 --> 00:00:10.450
 Paul, servant of God and apostle of 

00:00:08.410 --> 00:00:12.670
 Jesus Christ according to the faith of the 

00:00:10.450 --> 00:00:15.070
 chosen of God and the knowledge of 

00:00:12.670 --> 00:00:17.529
 the truth that according to the piety in the 

00:00:15.070 --> 00:00:19.990
 hope of eternal life which god 

00:00:17.529 --> 00:00:22.119
 that does not lie promised since before the 

00:00:19.990 --> 00:00:24.580
 beginning of the centuries iv to its due 

00:00:22.119 --> 00:00:25.990
 time he manifested his word by means of 

00:00:24.580 --> 00:00:29.439
 the preaching that was entrusted to me 

00:00:25.990 --> 00:00:32.070
 by mandate of God our savior to 

00:00:29.439 --> 00:00:35.110
 'tito' true son in the common faith 

00:00:32.070 --> 00:00:38.859
 grace mercy and peace of god father 

00:00:35.110 --> 00:00:41.289
 and the Lord Jesus Christ our Savior 

00:00:38.859 --> 00:00:42.969
 For this reason I left you in chalk so that 

00:00:41.289 --> 00:00:45.250
 correct is what is deficient and 

00:00:42.969 --> 00:00:47.949
 establish sanz and we in each city 

00:00:45.250 --> 00:00:51.010
 just as I sent you out and 

00:00:47.949 --> 00:00:52.809
 reprehensible husband of one woman and 

00:00:51.010 --> 00:00:55.109
 have believing children who are not 

00:00:52.809 --> 00:00:57.760
 accused of dissolution or rebellion 

00:00:55.109 --> 00:00:59.949
 because it is necessary that the bishop be 

00:00:57.760 --> 00:01:03.999
 irreproachable as god administrator 

00:00:59.949 --> 00:01:07.180
 not superb not angry not given to wine 

00:01:03.999 --> 00:01:10.240
 no non-greedy earner of profits 

00:01:07.180 --> 00:01:12.310
 dishonest but host lover of what 

00:01:10.240 --> 00:01:15.549
 good sober 

00:01:12.310 --> 00:01:17.710
 holy self-owner retainer of the 

00:01:15.549 --> 00:01:20.290
 faithful word as it has been taught 

00:01:17.710 --> 00:01:22.329
 so that I can also exhort with healthy 

00:01:20.290 --> 00:01:24.820
 teaching and convincing those who 

00:01:22.329 --> 00:01:27.310
 they contradict because there are still many 

00:01:24.820 --> 00:01:29.409
 contumacious talkers of vanities and 

00:01:27.310 --> 00:01:31.869
 deceivers mostly those of the 

00:01:29.409 --> 00:01:34.420
 circumcision to which it is necessary 

00:01:31.869 --> 00:01:36.549
 cover the mouth that upset houses 

00:01:34.420 --> 00:01:39.310
 whole teaching for profit 

00:01:36.549 --> 00:01:41.829
 dishonest what does not fit one of 

00:01:39.310 --> 00:01:44.350
 they their own prophet said the 

00:01:41.829 --> 00:01:47.350
 cretenses always bad liars 

00:01:44.350 --> 00:01:48.580
 idle gluttonous beasts this testimony 

00:01:47.350 --> 00:01:51.009
 it's true 

00:01:48.580 --> 00:01:53.649
 so reprimand the harshly for 

00:01:51.009 --> 00:01:56.049
 that are healthy in the faith not attending to 

00:01:53.649 --> 00:01:57.929
 Jewish fables or commandments of 

00:01:56.049 --> 00:02:00.729
 men who turn away from the truth 

00:01:57.929 --> 00:02:03.220
 all things are pure for the pure 

00:02:00.729 --> 00:02:06.310
 more for the corrupt and unbelieving 

00:02:03.220 --> 00:02:09.099
 nothing is pure to them until their mind and 

00:02:06.310 --> 00:02:11.200
 your conscience are corrupt profess 

00:02:09.099 --> 00:02:12.040
 know god but with facts what 

00:02:11.200 --> 00:02:14.890
 deny 

00:02:12.040 --> 00:02:18.480
 are detestable, disobedient reprobate 

00:02:14.890 --> 00:02:18.480
 as for any good work 

00:02:19.020 --> 00:02:25.050
 chapter 2 but you speak what is of 

00:02:22.800 --> 00:02:28.110
 according to the sound doctrine that 

00:02:25.050 --> 00:02:30.630
 elders be serious sober cautious 

00:02:28.110 --> 00:02:33.540
 healthy in faith in love in the 

00:02:30.630 --> 00:02:36.300
 patience the old women themselves 

00:02:33.540 --> 00:02:39.120
 referents in their demeanor not as 

00:02:36.300 --> 00:02:41.670
 not slaves of the wine masters of good 

00:02:39.120 --> 00:02:43.860
 that teach young women to love 

00:02:41.670 --> 00:02:47.490
 to their husbands and their children to be 

00:02:43.860 --> 00:02:50.430
 prudent careful breeds of your house 

00:02:47.490 --> 00:02:52.700
 good subject to their husbands so that 

00:02:50.430 --> 00:02:55.050
 word of God be not blasphemed da 

00:02:52.700 --> 00:02:58.050
 also encourages young people to 

00:02:55.050 --> 00:03:00.300
 be wise introducing yourself in everything 

00:02:58.050 --> 00:03:03.000
 as an example of good works in the 

00:03:00.300 --> 00:03:06.240
 teaching showing integrity seriousness 

00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:08.520
 sound and irreproachable word so that 

00:03:06.240 --> 00:03:11.640
 the adversary be ashamed and have no 

00:03:08.520 --> 00:03:13.320
 nothing bad to say about you exhorts 

00:03:11.640 --> 00:03:15.720
 to the servants to be subjected to their 

00:03:13.320 --> 00:03:18.180
 masters who like everything that is not 

00:03:15.720 --> 00:03:20.550
 respondents do not disappoint but 

00:03:18.180 --> 00:03:22.290
 showing themselves faithful in everything so that in 

00:03:20.550 --> 00:03:24.840
 everything adorn in the doctrine of God 

00:03:22.290 --> 00:03:25.800
 our savior because the grace of 

00:03:24.840 --> 00:03:28.040
 God has manifested 

00:03:25.800 --> 00:03:30.360
 for salvation to all men 

00:03:28.040 --> 00:03:33.090
 teaching us that by giving up the 

00:03:30.360 --> 00:03:35.220
 impiety and to worldly desires let's live 

00:03:33.090 --> 00:03:37.740
 in this century sober just and 

00:03:35.220 --> 00:03:39.960
 piously awaiting hope 

00:03:37.740 --> 00:03:41.850
 Blessed and manifestation 

00:03:39.960 --> 00:03:44.610
 glorious of our great god and savior 

00:03:41.850 --> 00:03:46.920
 Jesus Christ who gave himself for 

00:03:44.610 --> 00:03:49.710
 us to redeem ourselves from all 

00:03:46.920 --> 00:03:51.980
 iniquity and purify so a people 

00:03:49.710 --> 00:03:55.740
 self jealous of good works 

00:03:51.980 --> 00:03:59.660
 this speaks and exhorts and reprimands with all 

00:03:55.740 --> 00:03:59.660
 authority nobody despises you 

00:04:00.710 --> 00:04:06.710
 Chapter 3 recalls those that are subject to 

00:04:04.580 --> 00:04:08.960
 the rulers and authorities that 

00:04:06.710 --> 00:04:11.660
 obey that they are willing to 

00:04:08.960 --> 00:04:14.240
 good work that nobody defames that no 

00:04:11.660 --> 00:04:16.130
 be quarrelsome but friendly showing 

00:04:14.240 --> 00:04:18.350
 all meekness to all 

00:04:16.130 --> 00:04:21.130
 men because we were also 

00:04:18.350 --> 00:04:24.140
 once insensitive rebels 

00:04:21.130 --> 00:04:26.840
 lost slaves of lusts 

00:04:24.140 --> 00:04:29.390
 and various delights living in malice 

00:04:26.840 --> 00:04:31.550
 and hateful envy if I abhor 

00:04:29.390 --> 00:04:33.350
 us each other but when it 

00:04:31.550 --> 00:04:35.600
 manifested the goodness of God our 

00:04:33.350 --> 00:04:38.360
 savior and his love for men 

00:04:35.600 --> 00:04:40.730
 saved us not for works of justice that 

00:04:38.360 --> 00:04:43.040
 we would have done it but for his 

00:04:40.730 --> 00:04:45.650
 mercy for the washing of the 

00:04:43.040 --> 00:04:48.020
 regeneration and renewal in the 

00:04:45.650 --> 00:04:50.690
 holy spirit which he poured into 

00:04:48.020 --> 00:04:53.210
 we abundantly for Jesus Christ 

00:04:50.690 --> 00:04:55.910
 our savior so that justified 

00:04:53.210 --> 00:04:57.740
 by his grace we came to be heirs 

00:04:55.910 --> 00:04:59.000
 according to the hope of life 

00:04:57.740 --> 00:05:01.580
 eternal 

00:04:59.000 --> 00:05:03.980
 faithful word is this and in these things 

00:05:01.580 --> 00:05:06.230
 I want you to insist firmly that 

00:05:03.980 --> 00:05:09.290
 those who believe in God try to be busy 

00:05:06.230 --> 00:05:11.720
 in good works these things are good and 

00:05:09.290 --> 00:05:14.210
 useful to men but avoid 

00:05:11.720 --> 00:05:16.700
 foolish questions and genealogies and 

00:05:14.210 --> 00:05:19.790
 contentions and discussions about the 

00:05:16.700 --> 00:05:21.980
 because they are vain and without benefit to the 

00:05:19.790 --> 00:05:24.440
 man who causes divisions after 

00:05:21.980 --> 00:05:26.960
 one and another admonition discards what 

00:05:24.440 --> 00:05:29.300
 knowing that such has been perverted and 

00:05:26.960 --> 00:05:30.710
 He sins and is condemned by his own 

00:05:29.300 --> 00:05:33.590
 judgment 

00:05:30.710 --> 00:05:35.870
 when it sends more or atypical art 

00:05:33.590 --> 00:05:38.180
 hurry up to come to me in micropolix 

00:05:35.870 --> 00:05:41.840
 because there he has determined to pass the 

00:05:38.180 --> 00:05:44.630
 winter to dinners interpreter of the law already 

00:05:41.840 --> 00:05:47.150
 Poles send them with request 

00:05:44.630 --> 00:05:48.980
 so that nothing is lacking and they learn 

00:05:47.150 --> 00:05:51.260
 also ours to take care of in 

00:05:48.980 --> 00:05:54.110
 good works for cases of need 

00:05:51.260 --> 00:05:56.560
 so that they are not fruitless 

00:05:54.110 --> 00:05:59.810
 everyone who is with me greets you 

00:05:56.560 --> 00:06:03.670
 greet those who love us in faith the 

00:05:59.810 --> 00:06:03.670
 Grace be with you all
