00:00:24.160 --> 00:00:27.840

 inside instead more finishes stand out 

00:00:44.130 --> 00:00:47.670
 captivating and unusual combinations

 chromatic materials as always ed 

00:00:47.670 --> 00:00:49.920
 assemblies are among the best of 

00:00:48.960 --> 00:00:51.570
 this segment 

00:00:49.920 --> 00:00:54.500
 but the real novelty brought by the facelift 

00:00:51.570 --> 00:00:54.500
 are the engines 

00:00:55.140 --> 00:01:00.270
 under the hood in addition to the classic 1.4 

00:00:57.570 --> 00:01:03.800
 tfsi and 1.6 tdi arrive for the first time 

00:01:00.270 --> 00:01:03.800
 turn of new three-cylinder engines 

00:01:09.020 --> 00:01:14.450
 we are talking about the brand new 1.0 tfsi 

00:01:11.840 --> 00:01:16.939
 on petrol and above all the unpublished 1.4 

00:01:14.450 --> 00:01:19.130
 tdi 90 horses and our test 

00:01:16.939 --> 00:01:22.119
 it really starts from the small diesel equipped 

00:01:19.130 --> 00:01:22.119
 direct injection and turbocharger 

00:01:22.640 --> 00:01:25.729
 we must admit that architecture 

00:01:23.780 --> 00:01:27.619
 tricilindrica is noted when 

00:01:25.729 --> 00:01:29.509
 starts the engine in particular a 

00:01:27.619 --> 00:01:30.799
 cold but if some are excluded 

00:01:29.509 --> 00:01:32.719
 phases of strong acceleration 

00:01:30.799 --> 00:01:34.490
 the sound of the small German turbodiesel 

00:01:32.719 --> 00:01:36.520
 disappears leaving room for the comfort of 

00:01:34.490 --> 00:01:36.520
 board 

00:01:36.880 --> 00:01:40.960
 an engine that offers a lot of consumption 

00:01:38.380 --> 00:01:42.820
 contents we reached 5.2 liters 

00:01:40.960 --> 00:01:44.560
 bar at 100 kilometers without having to 

00:01:42.820 --> 00:01:46.659
 adopt a particularly eco-friendly guide 

00:01:44.560 --> 00:01:49.740
 and a supply certainly not sporting 

00:01:46.659 --> 00:01:51.869
 but in line with the daily guide 

00:01:49.740 --> 00:01:53.939
 in short the audio 1 chosen from 40 thousand 

00:01:51.869 --> 00:01:55.259
 Italians in 2010 to date is a car that 

00:01:53.939 --> 00:01:56.909
 keeps intact the qualities of 

00:01:55.259 --> 00:01:58.890
 previous version while making mark 

00:01:56.909 --> 00:02:00.899
 a stylistic evolution that should 

00:01:58.890 --> 00:02:03.229
 allow her to stay on top in her 

00:02:00.899 --> 00:02:03.229
 segment
