00:00:00.679 --> 00:00:04.400
 in any case twitter that came to us through this account roa de quebec 

00:00:04.400 --> 00:00:07.870
 Channel 8 talk about the fashion industry 

00:00:07.870 --> 00:00:12.309
 e the imposition that television has also taken to participate in this 

00:00:12.309 --> 00:00:17.480
 telenovelas and commercial music culture and they are also roles by 

00:00:17.480 --> 00:00:21.500
 hundred burned because working have our children are no longer child roles 

00:00:21.500 --> 00:00:26.050
 that this is a playful child is the child ep the isea but in advertising 

00:00:26.050 --> 00:00:29.050
 are those children who 

00:00:29.749 --> 00:00:33.679
 they are in the body of a child but with an adult mind there are no positions 

00:00:34.660 --> 00:00:37.070
 aesthetics and adult makeup 

00:00:37.070 --> 00:00:40.770
 as a navigator and where we should aim because we talk about 

00:00:40.770 --> 00:00:44.370
 consequence especially in the psychological part of our teenagers 

00:00:46.510 --> 00:00:49.510
 d the advertising definitely handles 

00:00:50.030 --> 00:00:52.710
 what is today the party in motion to 

00:00:52.710 --> 00:00:53.480
 i 

00:00:53.480 --> 00:00:56.010
 simply as having as motto and peace 

00:00:56.010 --> 00:01:00.690
 that does not allow the person to reflect on what happens 

00:01:00.690 --> 00:01:02.170
 all or nothing 

00:01:02.170 --> 00:01:05.400
 billions of requests for brain cells 

00:01:06.120 --> 00:01:08.930
 and in some way to use them process 

00:01:08.930 --> 00:01:12.720
 who has the brain for somehow and a little beyond 

00:01:12.720 --> 00:01:15.720
 because to go a little beyond that immediacy 

00:01:16.410 --> 00:01:19.560
 tiller vaart push to a limit 

00:01:19.560 --> 00:01:21.290
 What does it mean 

00:01:21.290 --> 00:01:22.950
 break 

00:01:22.950 --> 00:01:24.320
 after passing 

00:01:24.320 --> 00:01:27.680
 do not worry that you have wings 

00:01:27.680 --> 00:01:30.870
 that's why it's like being on the edge of the roof of the building 

00:01:30.870 --> 00:01:32.510
 and throw yourself 

00:01:32.510 --> 00:01:33.890
 advertising 

00:01:33.890 --> 00:01:36.730
 I do not see it since July of brun the last years 

00:01:36.730 --> 00:01:39.730
 figueroa high level to break the barriers 

00:01:39.730 --> 00:01:41.060
 so 

00:01:41.060 --> 00:01:42.840
 it does not have to somehow 

00:01:42.840 --> 00:01:47.300
 know that you have a brain and that you have a process a process of reflection 

00:01:47.300 --> 00:01:49.070
 g too 

00:01:49.070 --> 00:01:51.050
 exist 

00:01:51.050 --> 00:01:54.500
 books heaps of information heaps of 

00:01:54.500 --> 00:01:57.070
 ways of seeing life on this planet 

00:01:57.070 --> 00:02:00.140
 that the fact that one was born in this country 

00:02:00.140 --> 00:02:03.290
 Western hemisphere does not mean that that culture 

00:02:04.040 --> 00:02:06.550
 who are imposing 1 mostly through 

00:02:06.550 --> 00:02:07.730
 advertising 

00:02:07.730 --> 00:02:12.410
 that to which predominates then somehow look further because 

00:02:12.410 --> 00:02:14.229
 in africa all women 

00:02:14.229 --> 00:02:15.539
 they have nothing 

00:02:15.539 --> 00:02:16.909
 so naked 

00:02:16.909 --> 00:02:19.459
 right here in our jungle are naked 

00:02:19.459 --> 00:02:22.560
 that's what we're looking for because we look for rags to 

00:02:22.560 --> 00:02:23.389
 cover us 

00:02:23.389 --> 00:02:25.870
 what we would like to be receiving why 

00:02:25.870 --> 00:02:30.100
 If it is because of having big and beautiful breasts we would like to 

00:02:30.100 --> 00:02:35.360
 husband and I can demand women to exhibit for real or go to a beach 

00:02:35.360 --> 00:02:39.630
 topless for example simple a rival not but it is that there is a whole question 

00:02:39.630 --> 00:02:40.510
 cultural 

00:02:40.510 --> 00:02:42.490
 there was a cultural thing 

00:02:42.490 --> 00:02:46.990
 well organized as that of the dead was like an eclectic mix and that clarify 

00:02:46.990 --> 00:02:50.900
 that's why I think it's important to reflect knowing another at least 

00:02:50.900 --> 00:02:54.649
 in these times where especially in Venezuela 

00:02:54.649 --> 00:02:58.360
 lives a process of revolution and transformation where women 

00:02:58.360 --> 00:03:02.870
 has already been included in other types of tasks where education has changed 

00:03:02.870 --> 00:03:05.870
 its direction where the family is part of education 

00:03:07.019 --> 00:03:11.269
 from her on television we can see women aesthetically 

00:03:12.109 --> 00:03:16.930
 normal natures not those canons of beauty that for many years the 

00:03:16.930 --> 00:03:21.639
 private television the one of involved considers that we have advanced have all 

00:03:21.639 --> 00:03:22.129
 the 

00:03:22.129 --> 00:03:25.760
 is crazy about the natural patterns in television and advertising 

00:03:26.590 --> 00:03:31.950
 now we see has already per cent percent let's say aesthetically they are no longer 

00:03:32.749 --> 00:03:36.829
 on television and this grace ap process of inclusion within the process 

00:03:36.829 --> 00:03:40.629
 of reordering worth the redundancy considered this case there is no winner 

00:03:41.179 --> 00:03:42.640
 Well, of course 

00:03:42.640 --> 00:03:44.149
 g the process 

00:03:44.149 --> 00:03:47.809
 of revolution and aldi especially the inclusion of the woman who has just been 

00:03:47.809 --> 00:03:51.969
 the week of the woman because it was not a day was a full week thanks to 

00:03:51.969 --> 00:03:53.489
 god i 

00:03:53.489 --> 00:03:55.839
 is if that inclusion has not benefited 

00:03:55.839 --> 00:04:00.400
 a lot because the woman has the opportunity to demonstrate that capacity that she has 

00:04:01.249 --> 00:04:05.669
 those trillions of cells in the brain and that also has a big heart 

00:04:05.669 --> 00:04:11.599
 within this body that does not bathe that what does not change it the fact of 

00:04:11.599 --> 00:04:14.539
 have the biggest breasts the heart and the heart 

00:04:14.539 --> 00:04:18.959
 and the heart has feelings and love is the main thing and if we 

00:04:18.959 --> 00:04:20.809
 we can guide 

00:04:20.809 --> 00:04:24.659
 make a side because I as a music understand the danger of advertising 

00:04:24.659 --> 00:04:25.050
 those 

00:04:25.050 --> 00:04:26.610
 a risky business 

00:04:26.610 --> 00:04:31.930
 we are not percent and becoming an extremely superficial society where 

00:04:31.930 --> 00:04:33.960
 we look for small percent 

00:04:33.960 --> 00:04:38.569
 small spaces small stretches where to locate us to be able to 

00:04:38.569 --> 00:04:43.139
 try to control everything but it's a lie is a lie we have to stand 

00:04:43.139 --> 00:04:47.800
 over the earth and locate us in a land that trembles like Japan trembling and 

00:04:47.800 --> 00:04:52.090
 as it continues to tremble in all parts of the world and that sooner or later that tremor 

00:04:52.090 --> 00:04:54.669
 the entrance to each of the others by the feet 

00:04:54.669 --> 00:04:59.080
 and let's realize where we are because we are on the earth 

00:04:59.080 --> 00:05:04.270
 this great planet and the woman has a lot much more to express than 

00:05:04.270 --> 00:05:06.059
 simply an image 

00:05:06.059 --> 00:05:10.339
 voluptuous at chest level and especially girls have to realize 

00:05:10.339 --> 00:05:11.389
 that good 

00:05:11.389 --> 00:05:13.409
 it's time to take 

00:05:13.409 --> 00:05:17.120
 the rest of all the energy for the to achieve 

00:05:17.120 --> 00:05:21.460
 much more important things we have little time left and I wanted to give the opportunity 

00:05:21.460 --> 00:05:24.460
 each of you so that it will be the conclusion and I want 

00:05:25.009 --> 00:05:28.460
 this involves me the conclusion of the doctor because there are many centers 

00:05:28.460 --> 00:05:30.999
 aesthetic at this time 

00:05:30.999 --> 00:05:32.240
 tango s 

00:05:32.240 --> 00:05:38.060
 dam and I love that cheap advertising aa people we see now go in the city 

00:05:38.060 --> 00:05:43.039
 where they tell you change your body change your life if you're skinny if you're from it 

00:05:43.039 --> 00:05:44.650
 got what you want 

00:05:44.650 --> 00:05:49.449
 then how do you see it doctor mostly because that is causing deaths 

00:05:49.449 --> 00:05:50.719
 in this population 

00:05:50.719 --> 00:05:53.629
 I believe that the most important thing of what we are doing of the program 

00:05:53.629 --> 00:05:54.880
 documented 

00:05:54.880 --> 00:05:56.719
 is education to the population 

00:05:56.719 --> 00:06:00.089
 it is important that adolescents have a home 

00:06:00.619 --> 00:06:04.709
 well-formed where their parents could could avoid it in the right way 

00:06:05.520 --> 00:06:08.650
 and obviously we as medical professionals also 

00:06:08.650 --> 00:06:11.240
 help in that orientation process 

00:06:11.240 --> 00:06:13.150
 the fact of 

00:06:13.150 --> 00:06:17.410
 A lot now is very fashionable what is aesthetics and in many 

00:06:17.410 --> 00:06:20.630
 places is being aesthetic that is doing aesthetics for people 

00:06:20.630 --> 00:06:21.569
 that are not 

00:06:21.569 --> 00:06:23.749
 apt formed by percent 

00:06:23.749 --> 00:06:26.389
 the execution of procedures 

00:06:26.389 --> 00:06:31.259
 So the important thing is that every person who is going to be subjected 

00:06:31.259 --> 00:06:35.199
 post pc undergo a cosmetic surgery with an aesthetic procedure 

00:06:35.809 --> 00:06:40.409
 bush that the medical professional who is trained for the execution of 

00:06:40.409 --> 00:06:41.740
 these procedures 

00:06:41.740 --> 00:06:45.710
 harvest so collaborate to that message that can send to all mothers who do not 

00:06:45.710 --> 00:06:48.080
 they are fine and also everything in adolescents 

00:06:48.080 --> 00:06:50.030
 that at some point they have thought 

00:06:50.030 --> 00:06:53.460
 per cent the breast prostheses to these so young age 

00:06:54.680 --> 00:06:56.569
 I understand the minister does not fix 

00:06:56.569 --> 00:06:57.480
 Jorge 

00:06:57.480 --> 00:06:58.960
 I was talking about 

00:06:58.960 --> 00:07:01.180
 of dissatisfaction with the body 

00:07:01.180 --> 00:07:04.560
 and then he mentioned me where we've been talking about 

00:07:04.560 --> 00:07:06.119
 about self-esteem 

00:07:06.119 --> 00:07:09.119
 in the then nascent the message goes 

00:07:10.189 --> 00:07:13.180
 they want a little more to look more inward 

00:07:13.180 --> 00:07:17.250
 in what they are as a person of what they can give away from of looking for a 

00:07:17.250 --> 00:07:22.259
 aesthetic to please the other so that they accept me that in a way 

00:07:22.259 --> 00:07:26.360
 defense or by for by advertising by all on television by 

00:07:26.360 --> 00:07:27.479
 through the fences 

00:07:27.479 --> 00:07:30.879
 efe and also logical for heat friends 

00:07:30.879 --> 00:07:35.230
 that message to the family the lic the reinforcing he is with you 

00:07:35.230 --> 00:07:39.410
 the one that you are worth as a person and as you are that one of exploiting 

00:07:39.410 --> 00:07:44.300
 really your intelligence ability your ability to be this for that is going to 

00:07:44.300 --> 00:07:47.360
 think about leaving engraved 

00:07:47.360 --> 00:07:49.149
 despite this setback and adrián 

00:07:49.149 --> 00:07:50.289
 a complex does not 

00:07:50.289 --> 00:07:51.870
 to zp how are you 

00:07:51.870 --> 00:07:54.189
 this one because physically 

00:07:54.189 --> 00:07:58.830
 you can have an efficiency but emotionally it was also announced 

00:07:58.830 --> 00:08:01.440
 text can bring much more medvedev 

00:08:01.440 --> 00:08:04.810
 tiger is second although it influences a lot the advice of the grandmother and 

00:08:04.810 --> 00:08:06.100
 he kept it from his moms
