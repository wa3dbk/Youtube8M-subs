00:00:14.260 --> 00:00:22.000
 to be patient because if a virtue 

00:00:18.890 --> 00:00:25.430
 they have teams of tuca ferretti the 

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:28.490
 patients too and they do not go with all the 

00:00:25.430 --> 00:00:31.450
 ball is a team that gives has a very 

00:00:28.490 --> 00:00:33.350
 good tone visitor and we have to 

00:00:31.450 --> 00:00:37.310
 adjust to that 

00:00:33.350 --> 00:00:40.550
 with the small steps and good is that 

00:00:37.310 --> 00:00:42.140
 We have been giving and looking to add three 

00:00:40.550 --> 00:00:43.489
 points that are important is to say that 

00:00:42.140 --> 00:00:45.410
 in this it returns for us it 

00:00:43.489 --> 00:00:47.359
 feels a hundred feel that we have gone to 

00:00:45.410 --> 00:00:49.670
 look for the moments nothing else in other 

00:00:47.359 --> 00:00:51.469
 circumstances the team implements 

00:00:49.670 --> 00:00:54.180
 when you have the tournament you want to say 

00:00:51.469 --> 00:00:55.920
 for all and without fighting 

00:00:54.180 --> 00:00:59.910
 for being protagonists because the situation 

00:00:55.920 --> 00:01:01.380
 is that got us a sanitizing we have 

00:00:59.910 --> 00:01:03.660
 gone trying to adjust and nothing else 

00:01:01.380 --> 00:01:06.060
 a touch has many has many times 

00:01:03.660 --> 00:01:08.310
 working there is every player is 

00:01:06.060 --> 00:01:10.590
 he adapts his system and I, on the contrary, does not 

00:01:08.310 --> 00:01:12.540
 I see a very well done team very 

00:01:10.590 --> 00:01:14.010
 a lot of trade in all its lines and that 

00:01:12.540 --> 00:01:16.100
 it makes them dangerous they are not so it's 

00:01:14.010 --> 00:01:18.720
 they are almost the best visitor not then 

00:01:16.100 --> 00:01:21.240
 us at our 

00:01:18.720 --> 00:01:23.040
 to think about how we can attack them 

00:01:21.240 --> 00:01:26.160
 at what time to choose it also during 

00:01:23.040 --> 00:01:28.500
 the match for the team to come out with 

00:01:26.160 --> 00:01:30.030
 high is because he defends himself very well but 

00:01:28.500 --> 00:01:31.830
 they attack also very well in unfold 

00:01:30.030 --> 00:01:35.210
 has fast important people that 

00:01:31.830 --> 00:01:38.070
 unfolds but has a lot 

00:01:35.210 --> 00:01:40.289
 He did not mess around with all that is complicated 

00:01:38.070 --> 00:01:42.570
 always for a defense us today 

00:01:40.289 --> 00:01:44.880
 we are at home and we have to propose 

00:01:42.570 --> 00:01:46.500
 party we have to draw points because 

00:01:44.880 --> 00:01:49.280
 The only thing that remains is not in our 

00:01:46.500 --> 00:01:52.000
 last three games 

00:01:49.280 --> 00:01:55.400
 get the most points for 

00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:57.830
 add up in the percent issue is not 

00:01:55.400 --> 00:01:59.150
 complicated if not bad memory I think that 

00:01:57.830 --> 00:02:02.030
 is the only team that has not lost 

00:01:59.150 --> 00:02:03.500
 visitor then this indicates that 

00:02:02.030 --> 00:02:05.360
 they also stop well no no no no 

00:02:03.500 --> 00:02:07.310
 and do not give away anything gives me 

00:02:05.360 --> 00:02:09.200
 they will bury space they always try to 

00:02:07.310 --> 00:02:11.209
 adding then is what has led to 

00:02:09.200 --> 00:02:13.280
 that are placed in the zone 

00:02:11.209 --> 00:02:16.550
 of liguilla not then is it a 

00:02:13.280 --> 00:02:17.930
 stronger team in that aspect in the 

00:02:16.550 --> 00:02:20.020
 defensive we have to be 

00:02:17.930 --> 00:02:22.870
 smart at the time 

00:02:20.020 --> 00:02:24.700
 to have creativity forward and 

00:02:22.870 --> 00:02:27.010
 they will want to win us here at home 

00:02:24.700 --> 00:02:28.510
 then we know that it is a very 

00:02:27.010 --> 00:02:31.240
 complicated but we are working to 

00:02:28.510 --> 00:02:33.490
 win we know perfectly 

00:02:31.240 --> 00:02:35.380
 tigers does not have a very identity 

00:02:33.490 --> 00:02:37.750
 marked they like very much to get the 

00:02:35.380 --> 00:02:41.260
 position of the ball are very calm 

00:02:37.750 --> 00:02:43.970
 and seek to open spaces not to do 

00:02:41.260 --> 00:02:46.130
 deep we must believe it 

00:02:43.970 --> 00:02:49.370
 and being patient is looking to take away the 

00:02:46.130 --> 00:02:51.130
 ball and despair those in that way 

00:02:49.370 --> 00:02:55.210
 so that they do not develop their 

00:02:51.130 --> 00:02:55.210
 football as they would like
