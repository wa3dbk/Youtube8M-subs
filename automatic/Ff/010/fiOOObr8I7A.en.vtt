00:00:10.020 --> 00:00:16.450
 and there on the 3 1 bgb server 

00:00:13.390 --> 00:00:19.330
 a round bedways and yes I'm up 

00:00:16.450 --> 00:00:22.119
 The two players were struck by chance 

00:00:19.330 --> 00:00:25.029
 by weather when he went out 

00:00:22.119 --> 00:00:27.250
 and is a really awesome to word the 

00:00:25.029 --> 00:00:29.289
 I have everything that I always have 

00:00:27.250 --> 00:00:32.259
 so zok so the champions have so 

00:00:29.289 --> 00:00:35.289
 which I rarely look up to 

00:00:32.259 --> 00:00:37.420
 The property here is but was of the 

00:00:35.289 --> 00:00:38.889
 new factory right money something to 

00:00:37.420 --> 00:00:40.120
 example what I generated now 

00:00:38.889 --> 00:00:43.269
 there will be a lot more in any case 

00:00:40.120 --> 00:00:45.999
 now two svp also in the livestream the 

00:00:43.269 --> 00:00:46.829
 was a bit look the server 

00:00:45.999 --> 00:00:49.839
 play a little bit 

00:00:46.829 --> 00:00:53.609
 and yes that was a very chilled dog bed 

00:00:49.839 --> 00:00:55.659
 it was really cool on the server 

00:00:53.609 --> 00:00:57.159
 is definitely a server for everyone 

00:00:55.659 --> 00:00:59.709
 so on the track it server what i 

00:00:57.159 --> 00:01:00.699
 So even not so bad find 

00:00:59.709 --> 00:01:03.819
 you do not even have to sign indeed 

00:01:00.699 --> 00:01:05.440
 is logged in and yes I think so 

00:01:03.819 --> 00:01:08.520
 not so bad my god in the evening 

00:01:05.440 --> 00:01:10.930
 had bought the stars 

00:01:08.520 --> 00:01:13.000
 So I like the server in any case 

00:01:10.930 --> 00:01:16.480
 as often gamble on private as well 

00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:19.090
 but again by friction who on the 

00:01:16.480 --> 00:01:24.090
 salad would like to appear a bit 

00:01:19.090 --> 00:01:27.160
 Want to play with us are private and 

00:01:24.090 --> 00:01:30.320
 Now it starts 

00:01:27.160 --> 00:01:34.490
 US officials have been going down the line 

00:01:30.320 --> 00:01:37.190
 would actually be good up here 

00:01:34.490 --> 00:01:42.740
 we have the bed i think that 

00:01:37.190 --> 00:01:44.530
 Happens I think with the rich 

00:01:42.740 --> 00:01:50.080
 to record something here 

00:01:44.530 --> 00:01:53.750
 I have everything very strong left foot 

00:01:50.080 --> 00:01:56.200
 because the so so still fell well what 

00:01:53.750 --> 00:01:58.250
 planned is such a forum read correctly 

00:01:56.200 --> 00:02:02.050
 cool that then developed 

00:01:58.250 --> 00:02:10.250
 and everything so I like it a lot 

00:02:02.050 --> 00:02:11.810
 and then you have to down there everything 

00:02:10.250 --> 00:02:32.540
 I forgot something now I need 

00:02:11.810 --> 00:02:35.510
 again really nasty okay but if 

00:02:32.540 --> 00:02:39.620
 someone dies very cool owns here 

00:02:35.510 --> 00:02:41.709
 one against one so rather team against 

00:02:39.620 --> 00:02:41.709
 team 

00:02:42.609 --> 00:03:00.530
 no no, I am disabled 

00:02:46.750 --> 00:03:01.280
 I can sign my bad omi 

00:03:00.530 --> 00:03:04.400
 intervene again 

00:03:01.280 --> 00:03:10.730

00:03:04.400 --> 00:03:13.959

00:03:10.730 --> 00:03:19.790
 the means to belong now too 

00:03:13.959 --> 00:03:21.159
 somehow I do not even know I'm coming 

00:03:19.790 --> 00:03:26.239
 give yes I come to the opponents 

00:03:21.159 --> 00:03:33.159
 maybe I do not even know eight 

00:03:26.239 --> 00:03:33.159
 not what we saw yes seen with us 

00:03:33.760 --> 00:03:40.389
 caliskan the banker but i do not know 

00:03:36.950 --> 00:03:44.719

00:03:40.389 --> 00:03:52.579
 Okay, let's just say alos with the alos 

00:03:44.719 --> 00:03:55.489
 the excavator yes / no build yourself that you will 

00:03:52.579 --> 00:03:58.780
 but no kicker but I am 

00:03:55.489 --> 00:03:58.780
 I was also allowed to leave the day off 

00:03:59.290 --> 00:04:18.449
 when a man so away klose papa's 

00:04:11.640 --> 00:04:22.389
 I have wine and now dies yes 

00:04:18.449 --> 00:04:30.039
 still lives just pretty much down 

00:04:22.389 --> 00:04:33.160
 she should have it so now we have 

00:04:30.039 --> 00:04:33.699
 All or there is my god I came 

00:04:33.160 --> 00:04:39.460

00:04:39.460 --> 00:04:53.580
 I do not know if I will again 

00:04:46.539 --> 00:04:57.669
 my god 17 are the words of 

00:04:53.580 --> 00:05:01.090
 all goals would have won jan 

00:04:57.669 --> 00:05:03.250
 won and I would say that because the 

00:05:01.090 --> 00:05:04.500
 Round so quickly went on the beach 

00:05:03.250 --> 00:05:08.050
 thought she was going so fast 

00:05:04.500 --> 00:05:10.090
 because I say we 'll see each other round 

00:05:08.050 --> 00:05:12.509
 again and so by the way the savers 

00:05:10.090 --> 00:05:15.629
 just crass 

00:05:12.509 --> 00:05:18.669
 matter so until the next to equal 

00:05:15.629 --> 00:05:19.509

00:05:24.429 --> 00:05:40.810
