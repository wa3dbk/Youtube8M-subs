00:00:04.750 --> 00:00:07.750
 our 

00:00:09.430 --> 00:00:16.030
 let's find translation quality 

00:00:12.530 --> 00:00:16.030
 but we are now 

00:00:22.940 --> 00:00:26.350
 the sensitivity is that 

00:00:30.460 --> 00:00:34.649
 and the reality is that 

00:00:35.060 --> 00:00:40.810
 but you have reality you have a 

00:00:38.150 --> 00:00:40.810
 opportunity 

00:00:42.730 --> 00:00:46.680
 breaths of nothing 

00:01:03.379 --> 00:01:06.949
 it's a copy 

00:01:24.979 --> 00:01:36.509
 this is an invitation to find in 

00:01:34.200 --> 00:01:38.610
 the whole plus I think he has learned 

00:01:36.509 --> 00:01:40.979
 quite is taking off has the 

00:01:38.610 --> 00:01:43.920
 change of coach I think you are 

00:01:40.979 --> 00:01:45.620
 taking off learns before finished like 

00:01:43.920 --> 00:01:50.030
 the map 

00:01:45.620 --> 00:01:51.420
 now it's the last fight I did not see it 

00:01:50.030 --> 00:01:53.580
 tell 

00:01:51.420 --> 00:01:54.570
 perhaps sometimes within the 

00:01:53.580 --> 00:01:57.820
 legs 

00:01:54.570 --> 00:01:59.460
 decent way kept on it 

00:01:57.820 --> 00:02:08.000
 of walking 

00:01:59.460 --> 00:02:09.600
 it breaks down I 'm still going to make it 

00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:12.390
 trying to change coach 

00:02:09.600 --> 00:02:15.330
 is trying to take personality but 

00:02:12.390 --> 00:02:17.130
 in the same trance of taking personality 

00:02:15.330 --> 00:02:20.370
 own in the museum to feel what 

00:02:17.130 --> 00:02:23.989
 think for yourself what you should do 

00:02:20.370 --> 00:02:23.989
 that is costing you a lot of work 

00:02:25.810 --> 00:02:34.220
 and there was a phase in the seventh episode 

00:02:32.120 --> 00:02:35.960
 that changing the angles to want 

00:02:34.220 --> 00:02:38.200
 hit as if to turn 

00:02:35.960 --> 00:02:41.330
 even leaving 

00:02:38.200 --> 00:02:43.250
 exactly lateral way to be able 

00:02:41.330 --> 00:02:45.470
 hit him in the chest and he does not get it 

00:02:43.250 --> 00:02:47.510
 will have what you already have 

00:02:45.470 --> 00:02:49.489
 get a different compilation 

00:02:47.510 --> 00:02:51.590
 I knew it seems an advance for him the 

00:02:49.489 --> 00:02:54.620
 kick of says perfect doctor more 

00:02:51.590 --> 00:02:56.420
 advantaged I thought to try to imitate 

00:02:54.620 --> 00:02:57.980
 the father's first fight where 

00:02:56.420 --> 00:03:00.489
 get the world title among the 

00:02:57.980 --> 00:03:06.590
 thematic as he got it since he has 

00:03:00.489 --> 00:03:08.750
 within the head July you hamas under 

00:03:06.590 --> 00:03:13.430
 tiers never 

00:03:08.750 --> 00:03:17.800
 and this one becomes clear alive 

00:03:13.430 --> 00:03:17.800
 but the news when he blesses the world 

00:03:19.600 --> 00:03:24.550
 the same combat with 3000 was a summary 

00:03:22.150 --> 00:03:26.860
 of what has been totally irregular 

00:03:24.550 --> 00:03:28.990
 good contests against jon all in 

00:03:26.860 --> 00:03:31.480
 throwing a lot of punches in 

00:03:28.990 --> 00:03:33.580
 this last movie its huge where 

00:03:31.480 --> 00:03:43.300
 I did not throw technical errors 

00:03:33.580 --> 00:03:47.730
 own to find the land for its 

00:03:43.300 --> 00:03:47.730
 style of functioning 

00:03:56.489 --> 00:04:08.970
 no longer 

00:03:58.090 --> 00:04:08.970
 there is no stronger with laps 

00:04:16.079 --> 00:04:19.890
 connects many hits 

00:04:24.440 --> 00:04:29.070
 of student 

00:04:26.350 --> 00:04:29.070
 death 

00:04:30.850 --> 00:04:34.270
 I've changed 

00:04:41.259 --> 00:04:45.160
 action is not doing well 

00:04:46.240 --> 00:04:49.240
 dynamic 

00:04:53.180 --> 00:04:59.019
 and you're talking about this one never 

00:04:56.409 --> 00:05:00.639
 it's not technical intuitions but also 

00:04:59.019 --> 00:05:04.169
 the doctor is support because also 

00:05:00.639 --> 00:05:08.200
 received the mobile but like me 

00:05:04.169 --> 00:05:10.810
 technically with clear concentration in 

00:05:08.200 --> 00:05:12.370
 your wines means or fights when by 

00:05:10.810 --> 00:05:13.840
 some time I was also putting the 

00:05:12.370 --> 00:05:16.480
 fight in writing networks then agree 

00:05:13.840 --> 00:05:19.150
 with you but forming the same pilot 

00:05:16.480 --> 00:05:21.900
 that is not or not now be left as 

00:05:19.150 --> 00:05:21.900
 the rival who passes 

00:05:25.889 --> 00:05:31.570
 it seems that you do not have to create a 

00:05:28.120 --> 00:05:32.050
 backlash that the question is who is 

00:05:31.570 --> 00:05:33.639
 the best 

00:05:32.050 --> 00:05:35.800
 Today I think it's Juan 

00:05:33.639 --> 00:05:37.570
 Manuel Marquez definitely has a 

00:05:35.800 --> 00:05:38.770
 important history and in summation in 

00:05:37.570 --> 00:05:41.080
 next days will have to face 

00:05:38.770 --> 00:05:43.030
 manny pacquiao beyond all that the 

00:05:41.080 --> 00:05:44.680
 history that marks by rivals and 

00:05:43.030 --> 00:05:45.700
 that faced simply were the 

00:05:44.680 --> 00:05:49.690
 better a man who manages 

00:05:45.700 --> 00:05:52.350
 perfectly an already classical technique 

00:05:49.690 --> 00:05:54.669
 ignacio beristÃ¡in already marked of power 

00:05:52.350 --> 00:05:56.410
 combinations with both hands the cup 

00:05:54.669 --> 00:05:58.389
 the possibility of camping that 

00:05:56.410 --> 00:06:00.580
 contrast here is where it is best seen by 

00:05:58.389 --> 00:06:02.530
 angel marquez is without a doubt the great 

00:06:00.580 --> 00:06:04.000
 man where Mexican boxing and today in the 

00:06:02.530 --> 00:06:04.870
 bet more important to face the 

00:06:04.000 --> 00:06:07.420
 best boxer 

00:06:04.870 --> 00:06:09.790
 there is a story at least in the latter 

00:06:07.420 --> 00:06:11.590
 story that is manny pacman pacquiao yes 

00:06:09.790 --> 00:06:14.820
 the best pound for pound in the world but 

00:06:11.590 --> 00:06:14.820
 that the current world champion 

00:06:18.110 --> 00:06:23.320
 although it has more merits because there are more 

00:06:20.750 --> 00:06:25.249
 things have more recognition 

00:06:23.320 --> 00:06:28.790
 best level 

00:06:25.249 --> 00:06:30.710
 you do not have technique because you have 

00:06:28.790 --> 00:06:33.050
 has many points in his favor has 

00:06:30.710 --> 00:06:35.910
 trajectory but many things have 

00:06:33.050 --> 00:06:39.440
 producing how much nominal sciences 

00:06:35.910 --> 00:06:39.440
 in the benefit of the doubt 

00:06:40.240 --> 00:06:50.390
 we will have to wait for results 

00:06:44.490 --> 00:06:52.640
 career and important achievements natural 

00:06:50.390 --> 00:06:53.590
 and we have to support ourselves and there they go well going to 

00:06:52.640 --> 00:06:55.280
 walk 

00:06:53.590 --> 00:06:57.410
 as well 

00:06:55.280 --> 00:07:00.220
 with all the things have worked but 

00:06:57.410 --> 00:07:00.220
 it will have to wait
