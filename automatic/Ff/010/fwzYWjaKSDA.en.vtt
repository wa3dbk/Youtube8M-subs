I<00:03:48.700> think<00:03:49.700> the<00:03:49.760> key<00:03:50.090> insight<00:03:50.510> from<00:03:50.750> our<00:03:50.930> point

I think the key insight from our point

00:03:51.170 --> 00:03:52.990 
I think the key insight from our point
of<00:03:51.319> view<00:03:51.379> is<00:03:51.650> you<00:03:52.160> cannot<00:03:52.430> program<00:03:52.730> these

00:03:52.990 --> 00:03:53.000

00:04:01.000 --> 00:04:01.010 
autonomously and how you bootstrap them
