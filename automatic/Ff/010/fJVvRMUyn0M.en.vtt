00:00:04.700 --> 00:00:07.519
 So it's not the first one 

00:00:05.779 --> 00:00:09.469
 training camp throughout for me 

00:00:07.519 --> 00:00:10.879
 been and it was I think 

00:00:09.469 --> 00:00:13.040
 has been conditions down to the last 

00:00:10.879 --> 00:00:14.870
 two days where it's a bit stronger 

00:00:13.040 --> 00:00:17.930
 but has been raining I think on a large scale 

00:00:14.870 --> 00:00:20.270
 and all that the whole package was was 

00:00:17.930 --> 00:00:23.419
 well and we were able to work well and yes 

00:00:20.270 --> 00:00:25.460
 That was an important week for us 

00:00:23.419 --> 00:00:28.149
 Time and again Munich and there are exactly 

00:00:25.460 --> 00:00:28.149
 on Wednesday 

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:32.500
 yes, yes 

00:00:30.910 --> 00:00:34.180
 For one thing, I already knew a few 

00:00:32.500 --> 00:00:36.280
 players from the past and the second 

00:00:34.180 --> 00:00:37.840
 I have already said it is here 

00:00:36.280 --> 00:00:39.460
 but all speak German and 

00:00:37.840 --> 00:00:41.200
 I have noticed how difficult it is now 

00:00:39.460 --> 00:00:42.670
 if you do not speak the language of 

00:00:41.200 --> 00:00:46.559
 at the beginning speaks and therefore against the 

00:00:42.670 --> 00:00:46.559
 integration actually runs smoothly 

00:00:47.960 --> 00:00:51.590
 yes of course you like 

00:00:49.640 --> 00:00:52.790
 success experience but from my 

00:00:51.590 --> 00:00:53.989
 I have often had experience 

00:00:52.790 --> 00:00:56.660
 noticed that in the preparation 

00:00:53.989 --> 00:00:58.190
 that the results are not the most important 

00:00:56.660 --> 00:01:00.079
 It's important what you combine 

00:00:58.190 --> 00:01:00.829
 has the pressure on the games and I think 

00:01:00.079 --> 00:01:02.660
 they were good 

00:01:00.829 --> 00:01:06.350
 Of course you have to turn off a few things 

00:01:02.660 --> 00:01:07.700
 but often it is the worse the worse 

00:01:06.350 --> 00:01:09.020
 Results in the preparation run 

00:01:07.700 --> 00:01:10.940
 The better the season and then 

00:01:09.020 --> 00:01:13.090
 I hope so and we all hope 

00:01:10.940 --> 00:01:13.090
 think 

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:17.970
 we have a hard sun 

00:01:16.380 --> 00:01:20.040
 Training weeks ahead again a 

00:01:17.970 --> 00:01:21.960
 test game and then I think after that 

00:01:20.040 --> 00:01:23.820
 Test match next monday tuesday 

00:01:21.960 --> 00:01:26.010
 then also the concentration on 

00:01:23.820 --> 00:01:27.540
 then increase the running game even more 

00:01:26.010 --> 00:01:29.970
 but clearly we are happy when it starts 

00:01:27.540 --> 00:01:32.690
 because that's what he prefers to do 

00:01:29.970 --> 00:01:32.690
 play soccer 

00:01:34.409 --> 00:01:37.210
 Clear is the motivation 

00:01:36.360 --> 00:01:39.220
 because 

00:01:37.210 --> 00:01:40.810
 Three points I mean that's nothing 

00:01:39.220 --> 00:01:42.400
 everything is very close together 

00:01:40.810 --> 00:01:44.680
 then a team has to play and pass 

00:01:42.400 --> 00:01:47.260
 You just have to get the chance 

00:01:44.680 --> 00:01:49.750
 use and that's why as we said we are 

00:01:47.260 --> 00:01:52.030
 Everyone is in a hurry and of course they want that 

00:01:49.750 --> 00:01:53.619
 early on it will shorten these three points 

00:01:52.030 --> 00:01:56.890
 or or even completely make up and 

00:01:53.619 --> 00:02:00.960
 that's why it's on 10 02 dÃ¼sseldorf 

00:01:56.890 --> 00:02:00.960
 to set an exclamation point
