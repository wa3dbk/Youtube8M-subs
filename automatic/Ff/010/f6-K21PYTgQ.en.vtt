 Coburg a word that makes the hearts of sports car fans beat faster 

00:00:11.730 --> 00:00:17.339
 secondly super sports cars, each with almost 500 hp compete today for comparison 

00:00:17.339 --> 00:00:22.509
 they have a lot in common, but also make big differences on the one hand 

00:00:22.509 --> 00:00:27.909

 Researchers challenger the Express out with build Nissan gt-r 

00:00:38.350 --> 00:00:42.060
 the massive Japanese carries a design that for European eyes 

00:00:42.060 --> 00:00:48.100
 getting used to is 486 hp moving for a sports car but right

 For decades, the epitome of dynamics and sportiness almost a

 legendary engine helps the cult Hecktriebler together 

00:01:07.320 --> 00:01:10.190
 Driving a Porsche has always had its price 

00:01:10.190 --> 00:01:15.300
 the price difference to the Nissan amounts to fierce 60 thousand euros for six horsepower 

00:01:15.300 --> 00:01:17.420
 less 4 

00:01:17.420 --> 00:01:19.190
 thanks

 Dr 

00:01:23.650 --> 00:01:29.340
 the industry may still be the driver driver that does not require a new l 

00:01:29.340 --> 00:01:32.270
 was on the limit to move 

00:01:32.270 --> 00:01:36.190
 perfectly tuned and comfortable shock absorbers as well as a precise 

00:01:36.190 --> 00:01:40.630
 Steering ensure the all-wheel-drive Porsche actually performs driving pleasure 

00:01:43.030 --> 00:01:46.680
 When accelerating to a hundred, the sector with three grief is seven seconds 

00:01:46.680 --> 00:01:50.700
 in front of the Japanese challenger the foursome one second

 and again in Worms

 interestingly the PlayStation were preceded 

00:02:06.520 --> 00:02:08.259
 all the more to remember 

00:02:08.259 --> 00:02:09.509
 So what to do 

00:02:09.509 --> 00:02:12.799
 but is not it that authors expect or something 

00:02:12.799 --> 00:02:14.939
 by 4 5 percent 

00:02:14.939 --> 00:02:17.899
 and it happened this time differently than it can be there 

00:02:17.899 --> 00:02:19.719
 Hat placed 

00:02:19.719 --> 00:02:22.789
 Last Friday bent agreed 

00:02:25.599 --> 00:02:28.669
 103 times in the program have the beauty 

00:02:28.669 --> 00:02:31.029
 coming weeks 

00:02:31.029 --> 00:02:32.649
 Franconia 

00:02:32.649 --> 00:02:35.649
 we act 

00:02:42.689 --> 00:02:45.689
 the athlete masters and mistresses 

00:02:46.349 --> 00:02:49.349
 That's why we prefer it 

00:02:51.179 --> 00:02:53.629
 it would have stayed that way 

00:02:53.629 --> 00:02:56.629
 the Bank of England BoE 

00:03:04.269 --> 00:03:07.269
 but still does not hope to do so 

00:03:10.589 --> 00:03:14.529
 at the braking distance I had to get a higher weight in the boat otherwise 

00:03:16.019 --> 00:03:20.939
 his competitor from Zuffenhausen also comes, thanks to investigators should one meter 

00:03:20.939 --> 00:03:23.939
 earlier to a halt 

00:03:25.049 --> 00:03:27.809
 As far as the properties are concerned, the decision between these two 

00:03:27.809 --> 00:03:30.889
 Super sports car which is now the better scarce 

00:03:30.889 --> 00:03:33.119
 the Porsche accelerated that was 

00:03:33.119 --> 00:03:35.789
 Herbern's a bit better but the track conditions 

00:03:35.789 --> 00:03:39.409
 Herter something better comfort he certainly the car since larger 

00:03:39.409 --> 00:03:40.739
 Tradition and 

00:03:40.739 --> 00:03:42.709
 also with more luxury to the pension 

00:03:42.709 --> 00:03:45.059
 the gt-r 

00:03:45.059 --> 00:03:48.449
 does not look like the Porsche Cayenne could be as dangerous 

00:03:48.449 --> 00:03:51.489
 to the big heavy car 1 tons made 

00:03:51.989 --> 00:03:54.149
 but if you give her on the racetrack 

00:03:54.149 --> 00:03:57.999
 in the slalom course Hesse drives unbelievably agile he is very phase shearing 

00:03:57.999 --> 00:04:02.179
 Food really harmonious car with the very well tuned four-wheel drive he 

00:04:02.179 --> 00:04:05.569
 has a dual clutch transmission which switches very gently he may have in 

00:04:05.569 --> 00:04:09.889
 Interior not the ambience the net was expected to have 486 hp in the car 

00:04:11.179 --> 00:04:16.399
 it costs about 60 thousand euros less than the Turbo UniStar with the clear 

00:04:16.399 --> 00:04:17.150
 winner 

00:04:17.150 --> 00:04:22.260
 the head has decidedly delighted the Nissan gt-r with ordinary comfort 

00:04:22.259 --> 00:04:27.289
 agile mendling and harmonic drive a cost-effective everyday athlete with 

00:04:27.289 --> 00:04:29.270
 high speed potential 

00:04:29.270 --> 00:04:32.650
 The industry is expensive but still worth its money 

00:04:32.650 --> 00:04:37.280
 as a high-class Gran Turismo he does the shopping tour just as confidently 

00:04:37.280 --> 00:04:39.940
 for the trip to the race track
