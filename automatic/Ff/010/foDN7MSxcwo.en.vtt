carry<00:02:05.500> under<00:02:06.369> 120<00:02:07.330> characters<00:02:08.519> so<00:02:09.519> that<00:02:09.670> one's

00:02:09.810 --> 00:02:09.820 
carry under 120 characters so that one's

00:02:09.820 --> 00:02:13.170 
carry under 120 characters so that one's
okay<00:02:09.910> with<00:02:10.330> that<00:02:10.450> spin<00:02:10.780> and<00:02:11.400> it's<00:02:12.400> using<00:02:12.880> the

00:02:13.170 --> 00:02:13.180 
okay with that spin and it's using the

00:02:13.180 --> 00:02:16.949 
okay with that spin and it's using the
longer<00:02:14.019> words<00:02:15.239> so<00:02:16.239> I<00:02:16.269> have<00:02:16.450> to<00:02:16.569> edit<00:02:16.720> that

00:02:16.949 --> 00:02:16.959 
longer words so I have to edit that

00:02:16.959 --> 00:02:20.880 
longer words so I have to edit that
again<00:02:17.260> and<00:02:17.470> importantly<00:02:18.569> see<00:02:19.569> here<00:02:20.019> it's<00:02:20.560> cut

00:02:20.880 --> 00:02:20.890 
again and importantly see here it's cut

00:02:20.890 --> 00:02:24.180 
again and importantly see here it's cut
off<00:02:21.010> the<00:02:21.519> tags<00:02:22.450> the<00:02:23.260> hashtags<00:02:23.680> which<00:02:23.890> means

00:02:24.180 --> 00:02:24.190 
off the tags the hashtags which means

00:02:24.190 --> 00:02:26.759 
off the tags the hashtags which means
it's<00:02:24.820> completely<00:02:25.510> useless<00:02:25.690> so<00:02:26.440> in<00:02:26.530> the<00:02:26.650> next

00:02:26.759 --> 00:02:26.769 
it's completely useless so in the next

00:02:26.769 --> 00:02:29.430 
it's completely useless so in the next
edit<00:02:27.610> of<00:02:27.700> this<00:02:27.880> message<00:02:28.239> I<00:02:28.390> put<00:02:28.570> I'll<00:02:28.840> put<00:02:29.260> the

00:02:29.430 --> 00:02:29.440 
edit of this message I put I'll put the

00:02:29.440 --> 00:02:31.050 
edit of this message I put I'll put the
hashtag<00:02:30.070> throughout<00:02:30.340> the<00:02:30.430> beginning<00:02:30.760> so<00:02:30.940> we

00:02:31.050 --> 00:02:31.060 
hashtag throughout the beginning so we

00:02:31.060 --> 00:02:40.580 
hashtag throughout the beginning so we
never<00:02:31.269> lose<00:02:31.630> those

00:02:40.580 --> 00:02:40.590 

00:02:40.590 --> 00:02:42.810 

here's<00:02:41.590> a<00:02:41.710> new<00:02:41.860> message<00:02:41.890> I've<00:02:42.370> put<00:02:42.580> the

00:02:42.810 --> 00:02:42.820 
here's a new message I've put the

00:02:42.820 --> 00:02:43.980 
here's a new message I've put the
hashtags<00:02:43.330> at<00:02:43.480> the<00:02:43.540> beginning<00:02:43.870> and

00:02:43.980 --> 00:02:43.990 
hashtags at the beginning and

00:02:43.990 --> 00:02:46.740 
hashtags at the beginning and
importantly<00:02:44.950> we<00:02:45.370> can<00:02:45.520> use<00:02:45.640> a<00:02:45.670> spin<00:02:46.000> tax<00:02:46.240> with

00:02:46.740 --> 00:02:46.750 
importantly we can use a spin tax with

00:02:46.750 --> 00:02:48.990 
importantly we can use a spin tax with
hashtags<00:02:47.380> so<00:02:47.650> we<00:02:47.770> can<00:02:47.950> target<00:02:48.520> as<00:02:48.760> many

00:02:48.990 --> 00:02:49.000 
hashtags so we can target as many

00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:52.260 
hashtags so we can target as many
hashtags<00:02:49.270> as<00:02:49.750> you<00:02:49.900> like<00:02:50.080> and<00:02:50.290> also<00:02:50.950> in<00:02:51.610> here
