00:01:05.640 --> 00:01:08.500 

it's<00:01:06.030> kind<00:01:06.270> of<00:01:06.300> weird<00:01:06.510> I<00:01:06.720> never<00:01:06.930> seen<00:01:07.229> a

00:01:08.500 --> 00:01:08.510 
it's kind of weird I never seen a

00:01:08.510 --> 00:01:11.750 
it's kind of weird I never seen a
downgrade<00:01:09.510> of<00:01:09.840> a<00:01:10.470> game<00:01:10.680> when<00:01:10.950> it<00:01:10.979> goes<00:01:11.220> up<00:01:11.490> the

00:01:11.750 --> 00:01:11.760 
downgrade of a game when it goes up the

00:01:11.760 --> 00:01:14.120 
downgrade of a game when it goes up the
series<00:01:12.030> but<00:01:12.500> to<00:01:13.500> each<00:01:13.590> his<00:01:13.740> own<00:01:13.920> I<00:01:14.070> suppose

00:01:14.120 --> 00:01:14.130 
series but to each his own I suppose

00:01:14.130 --> 00:01:16.250 
series but to each his own I suppose
maybe<00:01:14.640> they<00:01:14.790> didn't<00:01:14.970> have<00:01:15.060> enough<00:01:15.270> money<00:01:15.300> just

00:01:16.250 --> 00:01:16.260 
maybe they didn't have enough money just

00:01:16.260 --> 00:01:17.840 
maybe they didn't have enough money just
kind<00:01:16.440> of<00:01:16.500> where<00:01:16.650> to<00:01:16.680> go<00:01:16.800> from<00:01:16.979> animation<00:01:17.729> to

00:01:17.840 --> 00:01:17.850
