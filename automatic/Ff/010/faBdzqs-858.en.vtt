00:00:07.140 --> 00:00:24.930
 good father of all countries and all 

00:00:20.210 --> 00:00:27.930

00:00:24.930 --> 00:00:32.009
 honor and we are proud of all 

00:00:27.930 --> 00:00:34.440
 the changes because here is also part 

00:00:32.009 --> 00:00:37.440
 of this thing from Spain 

00:00:34.440 --> 00:00:40.200
 it's an important formula to rescue has 

00:00:37.440 --> 00:00:42.600
 a formula that has to do with the 

00:00:40.200 --> 00:00:45.690
 Indigenous is a corn-based formula 

00:00:42.600 --> 00:00:47.760
 and what is the coastal cheese and how do we do it? 

00:00:45.690 --> 00:00:50.340
 us here but the traditional cheese 

00:00:47.760 --> 00:00:52.590
 of decoration that if they took what 

00:00:50.340 --> 00:00:54.950
 I left a little adriÃ¡n this idea 

00:00:52.590 --> 00:00:58.350
 came up with Carlos' birthday 

00:00:54.950 --> 00:01:01.289
 476 years to be a festival of the bread of 

00:00:58.350 --> 00:01:04.879
 Mayor's honor contacted us 

00:01:01.289 --> 00:01:06.860
 asked if we wanted to take on the challenge of 

00:01:04.879 --> 00:01:09.979
 make the biggest ono bread of the 

00:01:06.860 --> 00:01:12.020
 history and so we found it a very challenging 

00:01:09.979 --> 00:01:14.659
 cool and get it out then 

00:01:12.020 --> 00:01:16.970
 preside we assume the good challenge the 

00:01:14.659 --> 00:01:21.200
 oven bread ingredients were 20 

00:01:16.970 --> 00:01:23.810
 pounds of cheese 20 pounds of starch 10 

00:01:21.200 --> 00:01:26.240
 pounds of flour 10 pounds of 

00:01:23.810 --> 00:01:29.929
 butter and two pounds of milk in 

00:01:26.240 --> 00:01:32.390
 powder and a pound of sugar from the dough 

00:01:29.929 --> 00:01:35.659
 It takes an average of five minutes 

00:01:32.390 --> 00:01:37.759
 kneading process the pandebono know 

00:01:35.659 --> 00:01:40.849
 Well yes, how big is it? 

00:01:37.759 --> 00:01:44.060
 there one hour it takes of asado but the psoe 

00:01:40.849 --> 00:01:46.310
 it stays like about 40 

00:01:44.060 --> 00:01:48.170
 pounds more or less and let's do something 

00:01:46.310 --> 00:01:50.659
 new attention - grabbing then 

00:01:48.170 --> 00:01:53.420
 someone told me that there were going in some 

00:01:50.659 --> 00:01:55.970
 wine cellars and they will eat to do 

00:01:53.420 --> 00:01:59.420
 tastings and then they had good bread with 

00:01:55.970 --> 00:02:02.360
 ham no longer but I make the bread 

00:01:59.420 --> 00:02:03.979
 we delimited read a ham then I started 

00:02:02.360 --> 00:02:06.080
 to investigate what were the flavors that 

00:02:03.979 --> 00:02:10.009
 they could then combine each side 

00:02:06.080 --> 00:02:13.490
 bacon sweet sandwich 

00:02:10.009 --> 00:02:15.410
 Arequipa then I started to merge 

00:02:13.490 --> 00:02:17.900
 those with these flavors the one they like the most 

00:02:15.410 --> 00:02:20.540
 bacon because the mixture very well 

00:02:17.900 --> 00:02:23.870
 flavor that leaves very rich 

00:02:20.540 --> 00:02:26.620
 life 

00:02:23.870 --> 00:02:26.620
 dead
