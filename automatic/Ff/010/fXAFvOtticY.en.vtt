00:00:11.670 --> 00:00:14.660 

start<00:00:12.480> with<00:00:12.719> some<00:00:12.960> strips<00:00:13.290> of<00:00:13.469> fabric<00:00:13.709> I've

00:00:14.660 --> 00:00:14.670 
start with some strips of fabric I've

00:00:14.670 --> 00:00:17.210 
start with some strips of fabric I've
just<00:00:15.000> torn<00:00:15.360> this<00:00:15.599> and<00:00:15.959> it's<00:00:16.470> approximately

00:00:17.210 --> 00:00:17.220 
just torn this and it's approximately

00:00:17.220 --> 00:00:25.220 
just torn this and it's approximately
two<00:00:17.970> inches<00:00:18.390> wide<00:00:19.430> fold<00:00:20.430> the<00:00:20.759> fabric<00:00:24.230> round

00:00:25.220 --> 00:00:25.230 
two inches wide fold the fabric round

00:00:25.230 --> 00:00:27.439 
two inches wide fold the fabric round
off<00:00:25.500> the<00:00:25.710> sides<00:00:25.980> to<00:00:26.460> make<00:00:26.640> the<00:00:26.910> shape<00:00:27.119> of<00:00:27.329> a

00:00:27.439 --> 00:00:27.449 
off the sides to make the shape of a

00:00:27.449 --> 00:00:31.670 
off the sides to make the shape of a
petal<00:00:28.099> like<00:00:29.099> that<00:00:29.809> I've<00:00:30.809> done<00:00:31.110> three<00:00:31.380> strips

00:00:31.670 --> 00:00:31.680 
petal like that I've done three strips

00:00:31.680 --> 00:00:35.900 
petal like that I've done three strips
of<00:00:31.829> about<00:00:31.950> 20<00:00:32.430> inches<00:00:32.579> long<00:00:32.820> each<00:00:34.670> light<00:00:35.670> a

00:00:35.900 --> 00:00:35.910 
of about 20 inches long each light a

00:00:35.910 --> 00:00:38.690 
of about 20 inches long each light a
candle<00:00:36.149> and<00:00:36.480> then<00:00:36.870> singe<00:00:37.290> all<00:00:37.559> the<00:00:37.860> edges<00:00:38.309> of

00:00:38.690 --> 00:00:38.700 
candle and then singe all the edges of

00:00:38.700 --> 00:00:43.160 
candle and then singe all the edges of
the<00:00:39.059> petals<00:00:40.910> you<00:00:41.910> can<00:00:42.059> see<00:00:42.270> that<00:00:42.420> they<00:00:42.570> curl<00:00:42.840> as

00:00:43.160 --> 00:00:43.170 
the petals you can see that they curl as

00:00:43.170 --> 00:00:46.250 
the petals you can see that they curl as
the<00:00:43.350> fabric<00:00:43.590> melts<00:00:44.190> so<00:00:45.180> do<00:00:45.390> that<00:00:45.570> to<00:00:45.750> all<00:00:45.930> of

00:00:46.250 --> 00:00:46.260 
the fabric melts so do that to all of

00:00:46.260 --> 00:00:52.660 
the fabric melts so do that to all of
your<00:00:46.530> fabric

00:00:52.660 --> 00:00:52.670 

00:00:52.670 --> 00:00:56.060 

okay<00:00:53.670> I've<00:00:53.880> prepared<00:00:54.330> all<00:00:54.630> three<00:00:54.990> strips<00:00:55.410> and

00:00:56.060 --> 00:00:56.070 
okay I've prepared all three strips and

00:00:56.070 --> 00:00:59.360 
okay I've prepared all three strips and
I've<00:00:56.280> singed<00:00:56.790> all<00:00:57.030> the<00:00:57.270> edges<00:00:57.980> with<00:00:58.980> a<00:00:59.010> needle

00:00:59.360 --> 00:00:59.370 
I've singed all the edges with a needle

00:00:59.370 --> 00:01:02.270 
I've singed all the edges with a needle
and<00:00:59.490> thread<00:00:59.580> so<00:01:00.360> a<00:01:00.600> running<00:01:01.020> stitch<00:01:01.350> along<00:01:02.160> the

00:01:02.270 --> 00:01:02.280 
and thread so a running stitch along the

00:01:02.280 --> 00:01:06.920 
and thread so a running stitch along the
bottoms<00:01:02.670> of<00:01:02.910> the<00:01:03.720> strips<00:01:04.050> of<00:01:04.320> fabric<00:01:05.900> okay<00:01:06.900> I

strip to the bottom of the flower with
my<00:04:15.920> best<00:04:16.190> tip<00:04:16.579> is<00:04:16.850> that<00:04:16.880> as<00:04:17.269> your<00:04:17.480> flower<00:04:17.750> gets

00:04:18.009 --> 00:04:18.019 
my best tip is that as your flower gets

00:04:18.019 --> 00:04:21.190 
my best tip is that as your flower gets
larger<00:04:18.620> and<00:04:18.739> larger<00:04:18.920> it<00:04:19.850> works<00:04:20.060> best<00:04:20.420> to<00:04:20.630> cut

00:04:21.190 --> 00:04:21.200 
larger and larger it works best to cut

00:04:21.200 --> 00:04:23.980 
larger and larger it works best to cut
all<00:04:21.500> the<00:04:22.010> petals<00:04:22.400> in<00:04:22.580> your<00:04:22.730> hand<00:04:23.000> to<00:04:23.720> avoid

00:04:23.980 --> 00:04:23.990 
all the petals in your hand to avoid

00:04:23.990 --> 00:04:26.920 
all the petals in your hand to avoid
having<00:04:24.830> the<00:04:25.190> thread<00:04:25.490> catch<00:04:25.760> in<00:04:26.090> the<00:04:26.270> petals<00:04:26.630> as

00:04:26.920 --> 00:04:26.930 
having the thread catch in the petals as

00:04:26.930 --> 00:04:29.470 
having the thread catch in the petals as
you're<00:04:27.140> sewing<00:04:27.560> a<00:04:27.740> piece<00:04:28.340> of<00:04:28.550> felt<00:04:28.790> on<00:04:29.090> the
