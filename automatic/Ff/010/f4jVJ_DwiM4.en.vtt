00:00:10.360 --> 00:00:15.440
 then with the flash the flow will check 

00:00:13.430 --> 00:00:17.600
 Now we have the possibility of all three 

00:00:15.440 --> 00:00:19.279
 shapes opponents to measure what's up 

00:00:17.600 --> 00:00:20.450
 we is that happening in the assembly line 

00:00:19.279 --> 00:00:22.130
 the desired mass under pressure 

00:00:20.450 --> 00:00:24.560
 adjust for the fleece bank 

00:00:22.130 --> 00:00:27.970
 automatically starts and over us 

00:00:24.560 --> 00:00:30.320
 display shows the current flow 

00:00:27.970 --> 00:00:33.260
 All three reactors have the same 

00:00:30.320 --> 00:00:35.480
 Inner diameters are only of in shape 

00:00:33.260 --> 00:00:37.399
 and length slightly different component 

00:00:35.480 --> 00:00:40.090
 Number one comes directly from the customer 

00:00:37.399 --> 00:00:43.130
 The vehicle was thus moved in racing 

00:00:40.090 --> 00:00:45.050
 version 2 is one of our prototypes 

00:00:43.130 --> 00:00:46.930
 we built and the last one 

00:00:45.050 --> 00:00:49.400
 version is the version of the customer 

00:00:46.930 --> 00:00:49.900
 Finally use in the vehicle 

00:00:49.400 --> 00:00:52.340
 becomes 

00:00:49.900 --> 00:00:54.200
 Differences are how to be whole 

00:00:52.340 --> 00:00:58.970
 obviously can recognize anyway 

00:00:54.200 --> 00:01:00.710
 length and shape radii transitions and there 

00:00:58.970 --> 00:01:04.180
 Let's show how short it is 

00:01:00.710 --> 00:01:04.180
 the difference in the flow can 

00:01:44.870 --> 00:01:48.840
 as we could see now 

00:01:47.460 --> 00:01:51.630
 despite absolutely identical 

00:01:48.840 --> 00:01:55.290
 inside diameter of this restrictor about 

00:01:51.630 --> 00:01:57.450
 20 higher throughput than numero one thing 

00:01:55.290 --> 00:01:59.610
 purely on the form and its the 

00:01:57.450 --> 00:02:02.190
 wounds is just the same 

00:01:59.610 --> 00:02:05.000
 Forming with cylinder heads on cylinder heads 

00:02:02.190 --> 00:02:07.920
 and valve sits eon operated 

00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:10.650
 the influence of the 

00:02:07.920 --> 00:02:13.110
 form and of all geometry if 

00:02:10.650 --> 00:02:15.150
 one is this cylinder once individually 

00:02:13.110 --> 00:02:17.040
 Compared to our restrictor 

00:02:15.150 --> 00:02:18.660
 he is significantly taller and now 

00:02:17.040 --> 00:02:22.850
 let's demonstrate how much 

00:02:18.660 --> 00:02:22.850
 flow makes this component alone 

00:02:37.269 --> 00:02:42.860
 after we do some prototypes 

00:02:40.310 --> 00:02:45.590
 had someday been tested 

00:02:42.860 --> 00:02:47.769
 Ultimately, optimal shape and firm 

00:02:45.590 --> 00:02:49.940
 the whole part could be in the cad-system 

00:02:47.769 --> 00:02:52.269
 drawn and put into production 

00:02:49.940 --> 00:02:52.269
 become
