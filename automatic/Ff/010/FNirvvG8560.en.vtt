00:00:02.730 --> 00:00:07.440
 f what I do now is just say 

00:00:04.350 --> 00:00:09.540
 sound engineering in this sounds whole 

00:00:07.440 --> 00:00:11.010
 expensive but I make my own list 

00:00:09.540 --> 00:00:13.290
 that's what it comes down to they can 

00:00:11.010 --> 00:00:15.389
 ideas with a certain type of cover 

00:00:13.290 --> 00:00:16.920
 him there then I go number drugs and then 

00:00:15.389 --> 00:00:18.270
 I make that cover instead of me 

00:00:16.920 --> 00:00:20.250
 by a simple 

00:00:18.270 --> 00:00:21.510
 library dot zwolle goes looking for the 

00:00:20.250 --> 00:00:23.400
 correct sound 

00:00:21.510 --> 00:00:25.230
 what I like to do because the only 

00:00:23.400 --> 00:00:35.610
 I actually plugin where users 

00:00:25.230 --> 00:00:48.660
 that a bunch on drums and tonight chain 

00:00:35.610 --> 00:00:49.860
 on my method asked her was like me 

00:00:48.660 --> 00:00:51.360
 sat down at the computer went looking 

00:00:49.860 --> 00:00:54.239
 to nice sounds that I could use 

00:00:51.360 --> 00:00:54.660
 make the solution music with the 

00:00:54.239 --> 00:00:56.370
 computer 

00:00:54.660 --> 00:00:58.559
 and now, for example, I am going after that saint 

00:00:56.370 --> 00:01:02.190
 sit there and I make you and me sound 

00:00:58.559 --> 00:01:03.390
 think of hey what was there what works what 

00:01:02.190 --> 00:01:05.460
 I want to do this 

00:01:03.390 --> 00:01:08.040
 if i have a very cheesy melody and 

00:01:05.460 --> 00:01:10.530
 i played in via midi and i'll let you 

00:01:08.040 --> 00:01:13.560
 can go through the bulldozer and I go 

00:01:10.530 --> 00:01:14.400
 I submit to the larger, and therefore 

00:01:13.560 --> 00:01:15.600
 can turned 

00:01:14.400 --> 00:01:18.299
 interesting is a very different way 

00:01:15.600 --> 00:01:21.770
 of work than that you take a helper and 

00:01:18.299 --> 00:01:21.770
 he thinks okay what am I going to do with this 

00:01:37.230 --> 00:01:42.190
 so i use a wild and actually i 

00:01:40.090 --> 00:01:43.300
 use it already sequencer and if it 

00:01:42.190 --> 00:01:47.380
 machine in principle 

00:01:43.300 --> 00:01:49.390
 and if this then if I finish it then 

00:01:47.380 --> 00:01:50.920
 very whole argument to bows it out and on 

00:01:49.390 --> 00:01:52.930
 I'm a pro tools mix I 

00:01:50.920 --> 00:01:55.960
 so him table an advantage for me 

00:01:52.930 --> 00:01:57.640
 is personal to be at a real desk 

00:01:55.960 --> 00:01:59.590
 working is that i am more concerned with it 

00:01:57.640 --> 00:02:00.880
 sound is watching the screen 

00:01:59.590 --> 00:02:03.160
 and principle 

00:02:00.880 --> 00:02:04.119
 because you drive very quickly distracted 

00:02:03.160 --> 00:02:06.400
 by 

00:02:04.119 --> 00:02:09.009
 computer in a plugin qinetiq yoda and 

00:02:06.400 --> 00:02:11.560
 that mainly concerned with the computer and 

00:02:09.009 --> 00:02:13.900
 very little concerned with sound and like me 

00:02:11.560 --> 00:02:16.450
 go mixer then want to mix 

00:02:13.900 --> 00:02:18.070
 and then i go the percent one that i 

00:02:16.450 --> 00:02:20.560
 do is move my finger and i let you 

00:02:18.070 --> 00:02:22.690
 until it's good and I don't think so 

00:02:20.560 --> 00:02:26.489
 I would go was still growing a plugin 

00:02:22.690 --> 00:02:26.489
 is nice that is most difference 

00:02:35.920 --> 00:02:39.350
 I can do much more 

00:02:37.640 --> 00:02:42.640
 you can be much more playful with you 

00:02:39.350 --> 00:02:42.640
 music is doing even more
