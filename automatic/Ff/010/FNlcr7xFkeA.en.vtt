00:00:11.690 --> 00:00:19.660
 number one the simon with a larger dimension 

00:00:15.769 --> 00:00:24.829
 than two other southern proximal mpe 

00:00:19.660 --> 00:00:27.040
 committed and digital and daily if 

00:00:24.829 --> 00:00:30.759
 hinges closely with the 

00:00:27.040 --> 00:00:30.759
 precisely with radius 1 to 1 

00:00:38.170 --> 00:00:45.950
 give a currency exchange view to the proximal team 

00:00:42.550 --> 00:00:50.050
 It presents a greater tuberosity one 

00:00:45.950 --> 00:00:53.360
 tuber in October the middle 

00:00:50.050 --> 00:00:57.050
 between if we noticed two 

00:00:53.360 --> 00:01:03.790
 depressions who your name so the 

00:00:57.050 --> 00:01:06.500
 daily exchanges of africa 

00:01:03.790 --> 00:01:07.910
 we find a crest approaching and 

00:01:06.500 --> 00:01:11.960
 laterally 

00:01:07.910 --> 00:01:15.080
 denominated of general christ precisely to 

00:01:11.960 --> 00:01:18.790
 In general, a bone projection occurs 

00:01:15.080 --> 00:01:22.070
 Pink features two structures 

00:01:18.790 --> 00:01:24.550
 rounded speed and also in the 

00:01:22.070 --> 00:01:24.550
 ashdod city 

00:01:25.630 --> 00:01:33.850
 we also find a curve depression 

00:01:29.110 --> 00:01:33.850
 whose name is juice for some like brachial 

00:01:34.420 --> 00:01:40.819
 especially a second Christian 

00:01:37.340 --> 00:01:46.149
 presents is your name from Christ is supra 

00:01:40.819 --> 00:01:49.910
 side count is not accurate digital 

00:01:46.149 --> 00:01:55.460
 there is a fossa whose name is false 

00:01:49.910 --> 00:01:56.720
 radially a projection laterally 

00:01:55.460 --> 00:02:01.660
 the uniform 

00:01:56.720 --> 00:02:01.660
 this peak memory where the lateral 

00:02:02.350 --> 00:02:09.590
 not even general psi we find two 

00:02:05.569 --> 00:02:17.290
 codes characterized by an exchange with 

00:02:09.590 --> 00:02:17.290
 two children and a south and a chapter 

00:02:26.060 --> 00:02:32.010
 at once from the lateral the proximal team 

00:02:29.700 --> 00:02:36.210
 presents the larger tuber not only 

00:02:32.010 --> 00:02:38.730
 you can actually create your caudal potion 

00:02:36.210 --> 00:02:43.590
 this tuber we observe discreetly 

00:02:38.730 --> 00:02:47.040
 in the head number already in java 

00:02:43.590 --> 00:02:51.260
 we notice at full throttle and 

00:02:47.040 --> 00:02:51.260
 especially the speed and owner cano 

00:02:51.440 --> 00:02:57.530
 a curved depression presents itself and 

00:02:54.810 --> 00:02:59.280
 characterized them will occupy the charges 

00:02:57.530 --> 00:03:01.260
 just her 

00:02:59.280 --> 00:03:06.570
 we observe the crest on the freeze 

00:03:01.260 --> 00:03:12.600
 lateral projection until the bridge forms 

00:03:06.570 --> 00:03:18.080
 reveals that when the lateral is needed 

00:03:12.600 --> 00:03:18.080
 We are still observe the chapter 

00:03:24.750 --> 00:03:29.170
 already on the world list 

00:03:27.069 --> 00:03:33.010
 proximal hypnosis shows that 

00:03:29.170 --> 00:03:36.130
 actually the lesser tubercle totally 

00:03:33.010 --> 00:03:36.970
 head of the world just the head 

00:03:36.130 --> 00:03:39.940
 number 

00:03:36.970 --> 00:03:42.690
 we find a narrowing that receives 

00:03:39.940 --> 00:03:42.690
 the colo name 

00:03:43.810 --> 00:03:49.330
 already in the diaphysis we find an area 

00:03:46.900 --> 00:03:54.340
 not really prominent tuberosity 

00:03:49.330 --> 00:03:57.190
 round at the time I did such a 

00:03:54.340 --> 00:04:02.700
 projection portfolio reveals epicondyle 

00:03:57.190 --> 00:04:02.700
 medial we actually find the exchange 

00:04:10.600 --> 00:04:15.730
 really the proximal team presents 

00:04:13.600 --> 00:04:18.010
 Maria Elisa and conversation will articulate 

00:04:15.730 --> 00:04:19.150
 with the scapula from the capital of 

00:04:18.010 --> 00:04:20.790
 memory 

00:04:19.150 --> 00:04:22.600
 if the head in the world is 

00:04:20.790 --> 00:04:24.460
 materially she 

00:04:22.600 --> 00:04:28.690
 we also find part of the flow of the 

00:04:24.460 --> 00:04:31.420
 was the largest already in the diaphysis two 

00:04:28.690 --> 00:04:33.390
 structures present more closely 

00:04:31.420 --> 00:04:38.950
 it deals with superiority and dominated 

00:04:33.390 --> 00:04:42.280
 within the area and todd we 

00:04:38.950 --> 00:04:48.640
 juice to show that it is critical to 

00:04:42.280 --> 00:04:49.540
 freezing side as such are made 

00:04:48.640 --> 00:04:53.350
 presented 

00:04:49.540 --> 00:04:59.010
 the epic where the lateral ep and dino 

00:04:53.350 --> 00:04:59.010
 medial and the strength of joy 

00:05:05.720 --> 00:05:11.000
 the difference between domestic species 

00:05:08.120 --> 00:05:13.880
 in relation to the number of plants 

00:05:11.000 --> 00:05:16.730
 especially after the 

00:05:13.880 --> 00:05:19.220
 inpe uses the model features a watercress 

00:05:16.730 --> 00:05:24.010
 most a tuber best a tuber 

00:05:19.220 --> 00:05:27.400
 internet with two juices and tuberculosis 

00:05:24.010 --> 00:05:29.570
 other species such as government 

00:05:27.400 --> 00:05:34.600
 presents the largest tuber 

00:05:29.570 --> 00:05:34.600
 the smaller tuber and whole juice there 

00:05:41.039 --> 00:05:45.129
 the dog besides presenting the tuber 

00:05:43.989 --> 00:05:48.159
 bigger 

00:05:45.129 --> 00:05:51.249
 the smaller tuber is only a subtet 

00:05:48.159 --> 00:05:53.019
 Circular in the digital ep 

00:05:51.249 --> 00:06:01.809
 the fossa radio showed for the name 

00:05:53.019 --> 00:06:03.999
 that were named in this search 

00:06:01.809 --> 00:06:06.759
 case of felines and if they were displaced 

00:06:03.999 --> 00:06:09.269
 world is its name on 

00:06:06.759 --> 00:06:09.269
 to freeze
