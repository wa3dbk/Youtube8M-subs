saltiness to enhance the brine enos with
saltiness<00:02:13.540> from<00:02:13.600> the<00:02:13.750> bacon<00:02:13.959> enhance<00:02:14.410> the

00:02:14.490 --> 00:02:14.500 
saltiness from the bacon enhance the

00:02:14.500 --> 00:02:17.670 
saltiness from the bacon enhance the
brightness<00:02:15.040> of<00:02:15.280> the<00:02:15.340> of<00:02:15.820> the<00:02:16.360> oysters<00:02:16.810> I<00:02:17.050> think

00:02:17.670 --> 00:02:17.680 
brightness of the of the oysters I think

00:02:17.680 --> 00:02:19.620 
brightness of the of the oysters I think
it<00:02:17.800> could<00:02:17.950> use<00:02:17.980> a<00:02:18.130> little<00:02:18.310> bit<00:02:18.489> a<00:02:19.270> little<00:02:19.390> bit

00:02:19.620 --> 00:02:19.630 
it could use a little bit a little bit

00:02:19.630 --> 00:02:21.180 
it could use a little bit a little bit
more<00:02:19.810> bacon<00:02:20.170> will<00:02:20.470> mix<00:02:20.680> that<00:02:20.800> up<00:02:20.860> and<00:02:21.130> we'll

00:02:21.180 --> 00:02:21.190 
more bacon will mix that up and we'll

00:02:21.190 --> 00:02:23.490 
more bacon will mix that up and we'll
just<00:02:21.430> set<00:02:21.760> that<00:02:21.790> on<00:02:21.940> the<00:02:22.150> side<00:02:22.330> and<00:02:22.630> then<00:02:23.380> we

00:02:23.490 --> 00:02:23.500 
just set that on the side and then we

00:02:23.500 --> 00:02:28.199 
just set that on the side and then we
have<00:02:23.709> our<00:02:24.060> oysters<00:02:25.709> and<00:02:26.709> take<00:02:27.070> out<00:02:27.250> each

00:02:28.199 --> 00:02:28.209 
have our oysters and take out each

00:02:28.209 --> 00:02:30.210 
have our oysters and take out each
individual<00:02:28.720> oyster<00:02:29.170> and<00:02:29.290> lay<00:02:29.440> them<00:02:29.620> into<00:02:30.010> the

00:02:30.210 --> 00:02:30.220 
individual oyster and lay them into the

00:02:30.220 --> 00:02:32.220 
individual oyster and lay them into the
into<00:02:30.670> the<00:02:30.760> flour<00:02:30.940> and<00:02:31.239> the<00:02:31.330> oysters<00:02:32.080> the

00:02:32.220 --> 00:02:32.230 
into the flour and the oysters the

00:02:32.230 --> 00:02:34.289 
into the flour and the oysters the
fresher<00:02:32.500> the<00:02:32.650> oysters<00:02:33.130> the<00:02:33.340> more<00:02:33.820> freshly

00:02:34.289 --> 00:02:34.299 
fresher the oysters the more freshly

00:02:34.299 --> 00:02:37.979 
fresher the oysters the more freshly
shucked<00:02:35.130> the<00:02:36.130> oysters<00:02:36.160> are<00:02:36.670> before<00:02:37.120> you<00:02:37.480> hook

00:02:37.979 --> 00:02:37.989 
shucked the oysters are before you hook

00:02:37.989 --> 00:02:39.900 
shucked the oysters are before you hook
them<00:02:38.140> the<00:02:38.290> better<00:02:38.440> off<00:02:38.709> but<00:02:38.980> if<00:02:39.549> they<00:02:39.700> have<00:02:39.790> to

00:02:39.900 --> 00:02:39.910 
them the better off but if they have to

00:02:39.910 --> 00:02:41.729 
them the better off but if they have to
sit<00:02:40.120> for<00:02:40.360> you<00:02:40.600> know<00:02:40.690> an<00:02:40.810> hour<00:02:40.930> so<00:02:41.350> that's<00:02:41.620> so

00:02:41.729 --> 00:02:41.739 
sit for you know an hour so that's so

00:02:41.739 --> 00:02:43.199 
sit for you know an hour so that's so
that's<00:02:41.769> alright<00:02:42.220> as<00:02:42.340> well<00:02:42.519> they're<00:02:42.970> just

00:03:46.230 --> 00:03:46.240 
with some paper towel in it we can use

00:03:46.240 --> 00:03:48.310 
with some paper towel in it we can use
you<00:03:47.240> know<00:03:47.360> any<00:03:47.480> type<00:03:47.690> of<00:03:47.720> like<00:03:47.870> little<00:03:48.020> flat

00:03:48.310 --> 00:03:48.320 
you know any type of like little flat

00:03:48.320 --> 00:03:51.100 
you know any type of like little flat
cookie<00:03:49.160> sheet<00:03:49.400> or<00:03:49.580> anything<00:03:49.910> to<00:03:50.120> dust<00:03:50.960> some

cookie sheet or anything to dust some

00:03:51.110 --> 00:03:54.640 
cookie sheet or anything to dust some
often<00:03:51.470> we're<00:03:51.920> flying<00:03:52.220> at<00:03:52.460> about<00:03:52.520> like<00:03:53.650> 375

00:03:54.640 --> 00:03:54.650 
often we're flying at about like 375

00:03:54.650 --> 00:03:56.440 
often we're flying at about like 375
degrees<00:03:55.010> it's<00:03:55.670> nice<00:03:55.910> to<00:03:56.090> be<00:03:56.120> at<00:03:56.270> a<00:03:56.330> high

00:03:56.440 --> 00:03:56.450 
degrees it's nice to be at a high

00:03:56.450 --> 00:03:58.030 
degrees it's nice to be at a high
temperature<00:03:56.690> so<00:03:57.140> they<00:03:57.290> Chris<00:03:57.560> quickly

00:03:58.030 --> 00:03:58.040 
temperature so they Chris quickly

00:03:58.040 --> 00:04:02.800 
temperature so they Chris quickly
without<00:03:58.480> overcooking<00:03:59.480> the<00:04:00.220> oysters<00:04:01.480> so<00:04:02.480> the

00:04:02.800 --> 00:04:02.810 
without overcooking the oysters so the

00:04:02.810 --> 00:04:04.180 
without overcooking the oysters so the
idea<00:04:02.840> is<00:04:03.140> not<00:04:03.290> to<00:04:03.350> cook<00:04:03.620> them<00:04:03.800> completely

00:04:04.180 --> 00:04:04.190 
idea is not to cook them completely

00:04:04.190 --> 00:04:05.200 
idea is not to cook them completely
through<00:04:04.490> but<00:04:04.670> they<00:04:04.760> keep<00:04:04.880> them<00:04:05.030> nice<00:04:05.150> and

00:04:05.200 --> 00:04:05.210 
through but they keep them nice and

00:04:05.210 --> 00:04:07.390 
through but they keep them nice and
plump<00:04:05.660> and<00:04:05.810> juicy<00:04:05.870> inside<00:04:06.500> will<00:04:07.040> probably<00:04:07.310> be

00:04:07.390 --> 00:04:07.400 
plump and juicy inside will probably be
