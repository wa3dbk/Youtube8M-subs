00:02:26.590 --> 00:02:31.170 
some type of special occasion but for
everyday<00:02:26.860> use<00:02:27.310> it's<00:02:28.180> usually<00:02:29.849> these<00:02:30.849> two

just<00:02:37.060> the<00:02:37.239> raw<00:02:37.420> shea<00:02:37.840> butter<00:02:38.110> this<00:02:38.829> tends<00:02:39.250> to

00:02:39.360 --> 00:02:39.370 
just the raw shea butter this tends to

00:02:39.370 --> 00:02:43.410 
just the raw shea butter this tends to
be<00:02:39.519> time<00:02:39.940> to<00:02:40.120> heavy<00:02:40.510> so<00:02:41.260> I<00:02:41.769> don't<00:02:42.489> use<00:02:42.700> it<00:02:42.730> all

00:02:43.410 --> 00:02:43.420 
be time to heavy so I don't use it all

00:02:43.420 --> 00:02:47.640 
be time to heavy so I don't use it all
the<00:02:43.480> time<00:02:43.840> just<00:02:44.769> because<00:02:45.220> my<00:02:45.760> hair<00:02:46.090> is<00:02:46.470> kind<00:02:47.470> of

00:02:47.640 --> 00:02:47.650 
the time just because my hair is kind of

00:02:47.650 --> 00:02:50.339 
the time just because my hair is kind of
fun<00:02:47.950> and<00:02:48.519> that's<00:02:48.940> kind<00:02:49.299> of<00:02:49.390> heavy<00:02:49.629> and<00:02:50.019> I<00:02:50.079> just

00:02:50.339 --> 00:02:50.349 
fun and that's kind of heavy and I just

00:02:50.349 --> 00:02:55.199 
fun and that's kind of heavy and I just
don't<00:02:50.590> like<00:02:51.190> the<00:02:51.489> look<00:02:51.760> that<00:02:51.790> it<00:02:52.150> gives<00:02:54.209> but

00:02:55.199 --> 00:02:55.209 
don't like the look that it gives but

00:02:55.209 --> 00:02:57.289 
don't like the look that it gives but
yeah<00:02:55.450> other<00:02:55.720> than<00:02:56.019> that<00:02:56.230> that's<00:02:56.680> about<00:02:57.099> it

00:02:57.289 --> 00:02:57.299 
yeah other than that that's about it

00:02:57.299 --> 00:03:01.590 
yeah other than that that's about it
I'll<00:02:58.299> probably<00:02:58.750> start<00:02:59.440> doing<00:02:59.980> some<00:03:00.420> some<00:03:01.420> more

00:03:01.590 --> 00:03:01.600 
I'll probably start doing some some more

00:03:01.600 --> 00:03:03.809

00:03:14.339 --> 00:03:14.349 
different look not really what I'm used

00:03:14.349 --> 00:03:19.759

to<00:03:14.500> but<00:03:15.120> you<00:03:16.120> know<00:03:16.150> it<00:03:16.540> was<00:03:16.950> it<00:03:17.950> was<00:03:18.099> nice<00:03:18.599> I

00:03:19.759 --> 00:03:19.769 
to but you know it was it was nice I

00:03:19.769 --> 00:03:23.909 
to but you know it was it was nice I
don't<00:03:20.769> really<00:03:21.010> like<00:03:21.340> the<00:03:21.609> lazy<00:03:22.299> if<00:03:23.139> I<00:03:23.530> just<00:03:23.739> do

00:03:23.909 --> 00:03:23.919 
don't really like the lazy if I just do

00:03:23.919 --> 00:03:26.159 
don't really like the lazy if I just do
like<00:03:24.130> if<00:03:24.549> I<00:03:24.730> wedded<00:03:25.150> a<00:03:25.180> man<00:03:25.450> twisted<00:03:25.750> and<00:03:26.019> take

00:03:26.159 --> 00:03:26.169 
like if I wedded a man twisted and take

00:03:26.169 --> 00:03:28.170 
like if I wedded a man twisted and take
it<00:03:26.290> down<00:03:26.410> in<00:03:26.530> the<00:03:26.590> morning<00:03:26.889> because<00:03:26.980> I<00:03:27.489> already

00:03:28.170 --> 00:03:28.180 
it down in the morning because I already

00:03:28.180 --> 00:03:31.559 
it down in the morning because I already
have<00:03:28.599> a<00:03:28.630> TWA<00:03:29.319> so<00:03:29.769> it<00:03:30.040> makes<00:03:30.310> you<00:03:30.430> even<00:03:30.790> smaller

00:03:31.559 --> 00:03:31.569
