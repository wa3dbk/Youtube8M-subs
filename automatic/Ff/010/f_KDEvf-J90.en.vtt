00:00:00.950 --> 00:00:04.700
 hello how welcome are we to see the 

00:00:02.690 --> 00:00:06.559
 back to the day I am all the hawk and 

00:00:04.700 --> 00:00:09.889
 today I have a super simple recipe 

00:00:06.559 --> 00:00:11.540
 and very good to show how easy it is 

00:00:09.889 --> 00:00:13.639
 is to take the products of our 

00:00:11.540 --> 00:00:16.940
 complete favorites and make a recipe 

00:00:13.639 --> 00:00:18.830
 perfect today I want to bring you good a 

00:00:16.940 --> 00:00:20.990
 Lentil cream is a clearly 

00:00:18.830 --> 00:00:24.860
 you do pardinas that simply what 

00:00:20.990 --> 00:00:27.380
 I did was pour a little garlic onion 

00:00:24.860 --> 00:00:30.500
 leek carrot when we already have that 

00:00:27.380 --> 00:00:34.550
 pochado we put a laurel leaf and 

00:00:30.500 --> 00:00:37.130
 our lentils we cover with water and 

00:00:34.550 --> 00:00:39.290
 we let cook approximately one hour 

00:00:37.130 --> 00:00:41.480
 an hour and a half when we have already 

00:00:39.290 --> 00:00:43.940
 our perfect lentils what we're going 

00:00:41.480 --> 00:00:46.690
 to do is to pass it through a peat crushes 

00:00:43.940 --> 00:00:48.670
 and then strain it 

00:00:46.690 --> 00:00:50.289
 and we put a little cream and 

00:00:48.670 --> 00:00:54.020
 we raise another boil so that it 

00:00:50.289 --> 00:00:56.360
 incorporate well and make that cream 

00:00:54.020 --> 00:00:59.060
 with which we are going to accompany him to take us 

00:00:56.360 --> 00:01:01.070
 this ball in which it is made with 

00:00:59.060 --> 00:01:03.320
 Spread cheese and pork patÃ© 

00:01:01.070 --> 00:01:06.260
 Iberian that we will answer it in the 

00:01:03.320 --> 00:01:10.100
 background so that when we raise our 

00:01:06.260 --> 00:01:12.020
 cream is going to start to dissolve and it goes 

00:01:10.100 --> 00:01:14.870
 to bring a lot of enthusiasm to our plate 

00:01:12.020 --> 00:01:18.890
 and it's going to give another flavor another nuance and good 

00:01:14.870 --> 00:01:21.880
 and we have here an oil is an oil of 

00:01:18.890 --> 00:01:25.100
 extra virgin olive that what I did is 

00:01:21.880 --> 00:01:27.380
 put a little parsley in water 

00:01:25.100 --> 00:01:30.259
 boiling I take it out we cool it in water 

00:01:27.380 --> 00:01:32.479
 cold and we crush it with that we had it 

00:01:30.259 --> 00:01:33.880
 for a colander and we already have an oil of 

00:01:32.479 --> 00:01:36.039
 parsley 

00:01:33.880 --> 00:01:38.079
 I really did not want to put too much 

00:01:36.039 --> 00:01:40.210
 parsley because having such an oil 

00:01:38.079 --> 00:01:42.189
 It is foolish to try to overshadow 

00:01:40.210 --> 00:01:44.649
 this oil should be the protagonist of 

00:01:42.189 --> 00:01:47.500
 our parsley oil then good 

00:01:44.649 --> 00:01:49.280
 but if we go to the plated 

00:01:47.500 --> 00:01:53.320
 first of all 

00:01:49.280 --> 00:01:53.320
 let's catch our channel 

00:02:10.039 --> 00:02:13.659
 take our cream 

00:02:30.770 --> 00:02:37.569
 now let's put a little bit 

00:02:33.890 --> 00:02:37.569
 of sherry vinegar 

00:02:39.210 --> 00:02:44.900
 finally our parsley oil 

00:02:47.910 --> 00:02:52.520
 I want to finish with a leaf of parsley 

00:02:52.680 --> 00:02:59.280
 we already have a delicious lentil cream 

00:02:57.079 --> 00:03:02.930
 thank you and see you next time 

00:02:59.280 --> 00:03:02.930
 see what happens is to go around the day
