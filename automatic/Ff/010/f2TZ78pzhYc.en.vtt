okay<00:00:01.949> so<00:00:02.429> here's<00:00:02.669> the<00:00:02.820> trick<00:00:03.000> on<00:00:03.149> the<00:00:03.270> rockers

00:00:04.180 --> 00:00:04.190 
okay so here's the trick on the rockers

00:00:04.190 --> 00:00:07.249 
okay so here's the trick on the rockers
what<00:00:05.190> I<00:00:05.220> did<00:00:05.490> was<00:00:06.180> first<00:00:06.720> of<00:00:06.899> all<00:00:06.960> the<00:00:07.020> bad

00:00:07.249 --> 00:00:07.259 
what I did was first of all the bad

00:00:07.259 --> 00:00:09.740 
what I did was first of all the bad
rockers<00:00:07.620> I<00:00:07.740> cut<00:00:07.919> off<00:00:08.099> into<00:00:08.519> steaks<00:00:08.820> the

00:00:09.740 --> 00:00:09.750 
rockers I cut off into steaks the

00:00:09.750 --> 00:00:11.419 
rockers I cut off into steaks the
sections<00:00:10.110> that<00:00:10.230> were<00:00:10.320> really<00:00:10.620> really<00:00:10.740> bad<00:00:11.099> and

00:00:11.419 --> 00:00:11.429 
sections that were really really bad and

00:00:11.429 --> 00:00:17.150 
sections that were really really bad and
as<00:00:12.269> you<00:00:12.570> can<00:00:12.690> see<00:00:13.790> from<00:00:14.790> some<00:00:15.599> of<00:00:15.719> these<00:00:16.160> the

00:00:17.150 --> 00:00:17.160 
as you can see from some of these the

00:00:17.160 --> 00:00:19.340 
as you can see from some of these the
insights<00:00:17.550> were<00:00:17.789> totally<00:00:18.390> impacted<00:00:18.900> with<00:00:19.050> rust

00:00:19.340 --> 00:00:19.350 
insights were totally impacted with rust

00:00:19.350 --> 00:00:22.130 
insights were totally impacted with rust
and<00:00:19.590> that<00:00:20.580> was<00:00:20.699> a<00:00:20.730> decent<00:00:21.539> one<00:00:21.600> but<00:00:21.810> they<00:00:22.080> were

00:00:22.130 --> 00:00:22.140 
and that was a decent one but they were

00:00:22.140 --> 00:00:25.970 
and that was a decent one but they were
really<00:00:22.439> really<00:00:22.890> really<00:00:23.150> really<00:00:24.150> bad<00:00:24.740> so<00:00:25.740> what

00:00:25.970 --> 00:00:25.980 
really really really really bad so what

00:00:25.980 --> 00:00:28.130 
really really really really bad so what
I<00:00:26.039> did<00:00:26.130> is<00:00:26.310> I<00:00:26.400> cut<00:00:26.640> the<00:00:26.760> bad<00:00:27.330> sections<00:00:27.840> out<00:00:27.990> in

00:00:28.130 --> 00:00:28.140 
I did is I cut the bad sections out in

00:00:28.140 --> 00:00:30.230 
I did is I cut the bad sections out in
steaks<00:00:28.470> and<00:00:29.070> then<00:00:29.279> when<00:00:29.429> the<00:00:29.580> replacement

00:00:30.230 --> 00:00:30.240 
steaks and then when the replacement

00:00:30.240 --> 00:00:32.330 
steaks and then when the replacement
rocker<00:00:30.390> panel<00:00:30.779> came<00:00:30.960> I<00:00:31.260> cut<00:00:31.859> those<00:00:32.040> into

00:00:32.330 --> 00:00:32.340 
rocker panel came I cut those into

00:00:32.340 --> 00:00:34.700 
rocker panel came I cut those into
matching<00:00:32.820> steaks<00:00:33.149> and<00:00:33.450> then<00:00:34.110> I<00:00:34.260> attacked<00:00:34.590> him

00:00:34.700 --> 00:00:34.710 
matching steaks and then I attacked him

00:00:34.710 --> 00:00:38.750 
matching steaks and then I attacked him
into<00:00:34.950> place<00:00:35.190> and<00:00:37.370> unfortunately<00:00:38.370> the

00:00:38.750 --> 00:00:38.760 
into place and unfortunately the

00:00:38.760 --> 00:00:42.139 
into place and unfortunately the
replacement<00:00:39.420> pieces<00:00:39.680> aren't<00:00:40.680> on<00:00:40.860> the<00:00:41.730> exact

00:00:42.139 --> 00:00:42.149 
replacement pieces aren't on the exact

00:00:42.149 --> 00:00:44.540 
replacement pieces aren't on the exact
same<00:00:42.420> Bend<00:00:42.780> so<00:00:43.500> what<00:00:43.680> I<00:00:43.710> had<00:00:43.890> to<00:00:43.920> do<00:00:44.160> is<00:00:44.280> attack

00:00:44.540 --> 00:00:44.550 
same Bend so what I had to do is attack

00:00:44.550 --> 00:00:47.209 
same Bend so what I had to do is attack
the<00:00:44.579> first<00:00:44.940> the<00:00:45.510> top<00:00:45.809> edge<00:00:46.020> first<00:00:46.379> and<00:00:46.770> then

00:00:47.209 --> 00:00:47.219 
the first the top edge first and then

00:00:47.219 --> 00:00:49.430 
the first the top edge first and then
with<00:00:47.340> a<00:00:47.370> hammer<00:00:47.640> just<00:00:48.120> ease<00:00:48.360> it<00:00:48.660> down<00:00:48.690> there's

00:00:49.430 --> 00:00:49.440 
with a hammer just ease it down there's

00:00:49.440 --> 00:00:52.010 
with a hammer just ease it down there's
still<00:00:49.739> some<00:00:49.980> imperfections<00:00:50.309> right<00:00:51.059> here<00:00:51.449> but

00:00:52.010 --> 00:00:52.020 
still some imperfections right here but

00:00:52.020 --> 00:00:53.959 
still some imperfections right here but
as<00:00:52.230> I<00:00:52.410> go<00:00:52.620> I'm<00:00:52.770> tapping<00:00:53.070> these<00:00:53.430> down<00:00:53.699> with<00:00:53.940> a

00:00:53.959 --> 00:00:53.969 
as I go I'm tapping these down with a

00:00:53.969 --> 00:00:57.439 
as I go I'm tapping these down with a
hammer<00:00:54.739> and<00:00:55.739> then<00:00:56.340> the<00:00:56.489> bottom<00:00:56.820> edge<00:00:57.000> I<00:00:57.180> had<00:00:57.329> to

00:00:57.439 --> 00:00:57.449 
hammer and then the bottom edge I had to

00:00:57.449 --> 00:01:01.700 
hammer and then the bottom edge I had to
trim<00:00:57.750> to<00:00:57.960> trim<00:00:58.260> to<00:00:59.100> match<00:00:59.809> so<00:01:00.809> what<00:01:01.140> you<00:01:01.260> do<00:01:01.440> is

00:01:01.700 --> 00:01:01.710 
trim to trim to match so what you do is

00:01:01.710 --> 00:01:04.130 
trim to trim to match so what you do is
once<00:01:02.430> you<00:01:02.609> get<00:01:02.760> your<00:01:02.910> tack<00:01:03.210> down<00:01:03.539> here<00:01:03.960> in<00:01:04.049> the

00:01:04.130 --> 00:01:04.140 
once you get your tack down here in the

00:01:04.140 --> 00:01:06.260 
once you get your tack down here in the
corner<00:01:04.589> and<00:01:04.769> you<00:01:05.339> find<00:01:05.549> that<00:01:05.670> this<00:01:05.850> doesn't

00:01:06.260 --> 00:01:06.270 
corner and you find that this doesn't

00:01:06.270 --> 00:01:08.000 
corner and you find that this doesn't
match<00:01:06.450> exactly<00:01:06.960> just<00:01:07.439> feel<00:01:07.650> it<00:01:07.799> with<00:01:07.890> your

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:08.010 
match exactly just feel it with your

00:01:08.010 --> 00:01:14.210 
match exactly just feel it with your
finger<00:01:08.960> and<00:01:10.760> tap<00:01:11.760> it<00:01:12.000> till<00:01:12.180> it's<00:01:13.040> till<00:01:14.040> it's

00:01:14.210 --> 00:01:14.220

00:01:44.210 --> 00:01:44.220 
final welds and then just grind them

00:01:44.220 --> 00:01:46.910 
final welds and then just grind them
smooth<00:01:44.579> like<00:01:45.119> this<00:01:45.329> is<00:01:45.479> my<00:01:45.630> rough<00:01:45.899> final<00:01:46.710> weld

00:01:46.910 --> 00:01:46.920 
smooth like this is my rough final weld

00:01:46.920 --> 00:01:49.310 
smooth like this is my rough final weld
from<00:01:47.700> yesterday<00:01:48.240> I<00:01:48.270> haven't<00:01:48.780> ground<00:01:48.990> it<00:01:49.140> yet

00:01:49.310 --> 00:01:49.320 
from yesterday I haven't ground it yet

00:01:49.320 --> 00:01:53.420 
from yesterday I haven't ground it yet
but<00:01:50.159> when<00:01:50.939> it's<00:01:51.119> done<00:01:51.299> the<00:01:51.930> rockers<00:01:52.320> will<00:01:53.280> be

00:01:53.420 --> 00:01:53.430 
but when it's done the rockers will be

00:01:53.430 --> 00:01:55.789 
but when it's done the rockers will be
better<00:01:53.700> than<00:01:54.000> you<00:01:54.149> because<00:01:55.049> the<00:01:55.320> steel<00:01:55.619> is

00:01:55.789 --> 00:01:55.799 
better than you because the steel is

00:01:55.799 --> 00:01:59.149 
better than you because the steel is
better<00:01:56.009> and<00:01:56.280> I've<00:01:56.939> also<00:01:57.380> coated<00:01:58.380> the<00:01:58.619> interior

00:01:59.149 --> 00:01:59.159 
better and I've also coated the interior

00:01:59.159 --> 00:02:02.090 
better and I've also coated the interior
so<00:02:00.030> it'll<00:02:00.240> never<00:02:00.450> rust<00:02:00.719> out<00:02:00.840> again<00:02:01.110> there<00:02:01.979> you

00:02:02.090 --> 00:02:02.100 
so it'll never rust out again there you

00:02:02.100 --> 00:02:04.250 
so it'll never rust out again there you
go
