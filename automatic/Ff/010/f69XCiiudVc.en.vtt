flying into Detroit the explosives
didn't<00:00:48.460> go<00:00:48.549> off<00:00:48.729> but<00:00:48.940> this<00:00:49.030> was<00:00:49.179> a<00:00:49.210> new

00:00:49.319 --> 00:00:49.329 
didn't go off but this was a new

00:00:49.329 --> 00:00:51.059 
didn't go off but this was a new
technique<00:00:49.870> being<00:00:50.109> used<00:00:50.409> that's<00:00:50.589> possibly

00:00:51.059 --> 00:00:51.069 
technique being used that's possibly

00:00:51.069 --> 00:00:53.399 
technique being used that's possibly
what<00:00:51.639> would<00:00:51.819> what<00:00:52.149> we're<00:00:52.329> seeing<00:00:52.569> here<00:00:52.959> and<00:00:53.139> I

00:00:53.399 --> 00:00:53.409 
what would what we're seeing here and I

00:00:53.409 --> 00:00:55.799 
what would what we're seeing here and I
think<00:00:53.469> this<00:00:53.739> is<00:00:53.949> leading<00:00:54.729> partly<00:00:55.239> into<00:00:55.629> what

00:00:55.799 --> 00:00:55.809 
think this is leading partly into what

00:00:55.809 --> 00:00:57.180 
think this is leading partly into what
