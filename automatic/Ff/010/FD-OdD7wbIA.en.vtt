00:00:00.250 --> 00:00:06.360
 this is a video tutorial developed 

00:00:02.230 --> 00:00:06.360
 the laboratory cell phone games 

00:00:06.569 --> 00:00:11.550
 www.ca.com with the sponsorship of 

00:00:09.070 --> 00:00:11.550
 promotion 

00:00:12.600 --> 00:00:15.620
 hello and welcome 

00:00:15.740 --> 00:00:19.880
 Samsung devices have a panel 

00:00:18.320 --> 00:00:21.710
 of control where it is possible to review 

00:00:19.880 --> 00:00:24.080
 all the hardware options that 

00:00:21.710 --> 00:00:25.880
 they are included in the device 

00:00:24.080 --> 00:00:27.680
 in this tutorial we will see how 

00:00:25.880 --> 00:00:29.030
 access it to review the function of 

00:00:27.680 --> 00:00:31.610
 our teams 

00:00:29.030 --> 00:00:35.110
 let's go to the phone where is 

00:00:31.610 --> 00:00:35.110
 the dial to be able to mark 

00:00:49.770 --> 00:00:59.000
 and in it we are going to press star 

00:00:52.950 --> 00:00:59.000
 numeral 0 asterisk numeral 

00:01:08.240 --> 00:01:12.960
 once we press the command we will 

00:01:10.460 --> 00:01:14.670
 appear this screen 

00:01:12.960 --> 00:01:16.020
 what is a set of buttons that we 

00:01:14.670 --> 00:01:18.360
 allow to review the functions of 

00:01:16.020 --> 00:01:20.070
 hardware that the computer has if 

00:01:18.360 --> 00:01:21.840
 we press on the first three we're going 

00:01:20.070 --> 00:01:23.490
 to appear the display in a single tone of 

00:01:21.840 --> 00:01:27.320
 color corresponding to the color that 

00:01:23.490 --> 00:01:27.320
 indicates the green or blue red button 

00:01:29.040 --> 00:01:33.540
 and we press then we will appear 

00:01:31.020 --> 00:01:35.310
 a mesh that we must travel in the 

00:01:33.540 --> 00:01:36.960
 computer screen so he can 

00:01:35.310 --> 00:01:39.460
 recognize that we are using the 

00:01:36.960 --> 00:01:41.710
 touch system 

00:01:39.460 --> 00:01:44.700
 once we go through the whole mesh that the 

00:01:41.710 --> 00:01:44.700
 team proposes us 

00:01:50.690 --> 00:01:54.110
 we will get a notice saying that the 

00:01:52.790 --> 00:01:57.160
 equipment has passed satisfactorily 

00:01:54.110 --> 00:01:57.160
 these questions 

00:02:01.640 --> 00:02:06.790
 there is also the camera fruits and megacam 

00:02:07.990 --> 00:02:12.959
 and the button on the front camera that is a 

00:02:10.390 --> 00:02:12.959
 francesca 

00:02:13.650 --> 00:02:16.530
 we can see also by the camera 

00:02:15.329 --> 00:02:18.950
 front and check that everything is 

00:02:16.530 --> 00:02:18.950
 working 

00:02:29.440 --> 00:02:32.920
 we can also check the led 

00:02:31.150 --> 00:02:35.050
 represents the screen the bayern 

00:02:32.920 --> 00:02:37.470
 changing color making a 

00:02:35.050 --> 00:02:37.470
 sequence 

00:03:05.970 --> 00:03:09.900
 we can also check the panel of the 

00:03:07.950 --> 00:03:12.050
 sensors is very interesting because 

00:03:09.900 --> 00:03:14.370
 we can check the proximity panel 

00:03:12.050 --> 00:03:16.260
 the proximity sensor that is in the 

00:03:14.370 --> 00:03:19.140
 top right of the equipment 

00:03:16.260 --> 00:03:22.200
 samsung galaxy s3 lc3 mini is in the 

00:03:19.140 --> 00:03:24.720
 left part when approaching the finger or a 

00:03:22.200 --> 00:03:26.490
 object to the sensor the screen is placed 

00:03:24.720 --> 00:03:29.460
 in green and we also see a decrease 

00:03:26.490 --> 00:03:33.430
 of the luxe value where the indicator of 

00:03:29.460 --> 00:03:34.989
 light is that it is half the screen 

00:03:33.430 --> 00:03:36.370
 in this way we know that the sensor 

00:03:34.989 --> 00:03:38.230
 is working this sensor is the 

00:03:36.370 --> 00:03:39.519
 responsible for turning off the screen to 

00:03:38.230 --> 00:03:41.319
 save energy when we are 

00:03:39.519 --> 00:03:45.750
 making a call if we look at the 

00:03:41.319 --> 00:03:45.750
 accelerometer will appear this image 

00:03:47.680 --> 00:03:51.430
 and if we rotate the equipment in the image 

00:03:49.900 --> 00:03:54.069
 it will also rotate which tells us that the 

00:03:51.430 --> 00:03:57.209
 team is able to respond to 

00:03:54.069 --> 00:03:57.209
 that change of position

00:04:10.220 --> 00:04:14.860
 configuration 

00:04:12.050 --> 00:04:14.860
