you can see what's inside the box okay
we<00:00:54.460> got<00:00:54.579> the<00:00:54.670> h100<00:00:55.239> here<00:00:55.449> we're<00:00:55.659> going<00:00:55.749> to<00:00:55.839> open

00:00:56.040 --> 00:00:56.050 
we got the h100 here we're going to open

00:00:56.050 --> 00:00:57.750 
we got the h100 here we're going to open
this<00:00:56.320> up<00:00:56.379> and<00:00:56.769> take<00:00:57.129> a<00:00:57.159> look<00:00:57.339> and<00:00:57.489> see<00:00:57.579> what's

00:00:57.750 --> 00:00:57.760 
this up and take a look and see what's

00:00:57.760 --> 00:01:03.989 
this up and take a look and see what's
in<00:00:57.850> the<00:00:57.940> packaging<00:01:02.280> so<00:01:03.280> it<00:01:03.519> looks<00:01:03.670> like<00:01:03.850> we've

00:01:03.989 --> 00:01:03.999 
in the packaging so it looks like we've

00:01:03.999 --> 00:01:08.300 
in the packaging so it looks like we've
got<00:01:04.530> two<00:01:05.530> hundred<00:01:06.010> twenty<00:01:06.100> millimeter<00:01:06.550> fans

00:01:15.450 --> 00:01:15.460 
it for mounting the cooler actually to

00:01:15.460 --> 00:01:19.999 
it for mounting the cooler actually to
your<00:01:15.700> motherboard<00:01:16.330> over<00:01:17.140> your<00:01:17.259> processor

00:01:19.999 --> 00:01:20.009 

00:01:20.009 --> 00:01:22.709 

some<00:01:21.009> more<00:01:21.159> hardware<00:01:21.549> for<00:01:21.909> the<00:01:22.119> Phantom<00:01:22.570> would

00:01:22.709 --> 00:01:22.719 
some more hardware for the Phantom would

00:01:22.719 --> 00:01:25.740 
some more hardware for the Phantom would
socket<00:01:23.200> you're<00:01:23.350> going<00:01:23.530> to<00:01:23.590> use<00:01:24.750> whether

00:01:25.740 --> 00:01:25.750 
socket you're going to use whether

00:01:25.750 --> 00:01:28.260 
socket you're going to use whether
that's<00:01:26.020> AMD<00:01:26.619> or<00:01:26.649> intel<00:01:27.369> actually<00:01:27.850> this<00:01:28.090> would

00:01:28.260 --> 00:01:28.270 
that's AMD or intel actually this would

00:01:28.270 --> 00:01:30.630 
that's AMD or intel actually this would
be<00:01:28.420> your<00:01:28.450> intel<00:01:29.049> socket<00:01:29.380> and<00:01:29.799> this<00:01:30.399> one's

00:01:30.630 --> 00:01:30.640 
be your intel socket and this one's

00:01:30.640 --> 00:01:37.380 
be your intel socket and this one's
going<00:01:30.820> to<00:01:30.880> be<00:01:30.969> your<00:01:31.210> a<00:01:31.240> and<00:01:31.539> d<00:01:31.780> and<00:01:36.060> here<00:01:37.060> it<00:01:37.270> is

00:01:37.380 --> 00:01:37.390 
going to be your a and d and here it is

00:01:37.390 --> 00:01:43.099 
going to be your a and d and here it is
now<00:01:38.700> you're<00:01:39.700> going<00:01:39.820> to<00:01:39.880> see<00:01:40.119> them<00:01:40.770> this<00:01:41.770> is<00:01:41.950> a<00:01:41.979> a

00:01:43.099 --> 00:01:43.109 
now you're going to see them this is a a

00:01:43.109 --> 00:01:46.529 
now you're going to see them this is a a
closed<00:01:44.109> loop<00:01:44.259> system<00:01:45.090> and<00:01:46.090> you<00:01:46.240> got<00:01:46.420> your

00:01:46.529 --> 00:01:46.539 
closed loop system and you got your

00:01:46.539 --> 00:01:49.950 
closed loop system and you got your
radiator<00:01:47.020> here<00:01:47.500> and<00:01:48.299> this<00:01:49.299> plugs<00:01:49.630> in<00:01:49.780> for

00:01:49.950 --> 00:01:49.960 
radiator here and this plugs in for

00:01:49.960 --> 00:01:57.660 
radiator here and this plugs in for
power<00:01:50.170> and<00:01:53.460> there's<00:01:54.460> your<00:01:54.700> cpu<00:01:55.509> block<00:01:56.670> give

00:01:57.660 --> 00:01:57.670 
power and there's your cpu block give

00:01:57.670 --> 00:02:01.319 
power and there's your cpu block give
you<00:01:57.820> a<00:01:57.909> good<00:01:58.270> shot<00:01:58.570> of<00:01:58.600> the<00:02:00.090> thermal<00:02:01.090> paste

00:02:01.319 --> 00:02:01.329 
you a good shot of the thermal paste

00:02:01.329 --> 00:02:03.990 
you a good shot of the thermal paste
that<00:02:01.740> corsair<00:02:02.740> puts<00:02:03.009> on<00:02:03.159> from<00:02:03.429> the<00:02:03.579> factory

00:02:03.990 --> 00:02:04.000 
that corsair puts on from the factory

00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:06.510 
that corsair puts on from the factory
makes<00:02:04.329> it<00:02:04.509> super<00:02:05.020> easy<00:02:05.049> you<00:02:06.039> don't<00:02:06.219> have<00:02:06.369> to

00:02:06.510 --> 00:02:06.520 
makes it super easy you don't have to

00:02:06.520 --> 00:02:09.660 
makes it super easy you don't have to
put<00:02:06.700> any<00:02:06.880> arctic<00:02:07.810> silver<00:02:08.289> or<00:02:08.770> anything<00:02:09.340> on<00:02:09.520> the

00:02:09.660 --> 00:02:09.670 
put any arctic silver or anything on the

00:02:09.670 --> 00:02:12.540 
put any arctic silver or anything on the
cpu<00:02:10.179> before<00:02:11.170> mounting<00:02:11.620> you<00:02:11.890> just<00:02:12.130> basically

00:02:12.540 --> 00:02:12.550 
cpu before mounting you just basically

00:02:12.550 --> 00:02:14.880 
cpu before mounting you just basically
stick<00:02:13.180> this<00:02:13.330> up<00:02:13.570> there<00:02:13.720> on<00:02:13.840> there<00:02:14.080> and<00:02:14.320> you're

00:02:14.880 --> 00:02:14.890 
stick this up there on there and you're

00:02:14.890 --> 00:02:18.960 
stick this up there on there and you're
good<00:02:15.070> to<00:02:15.100> go

00:02:18.960 --> 00:02:18.970 

00:02:18.970 --> 00:02:21.190 

so<00:02:19.970> we're<00:02:20.270> going<00:02:20.330> to<00:02:20.480> take<00:02:20.660> a<00:02:20.690> look<00:02:20.900> at<00:02:21.020> this

00:02:21.190 --> 00:02:21.200 
so we're going to take a look at this

00:02:21.200 --> 00:02:22.690 
so we're going to take a look at this
I'll<00:02:21.500> show<00:02:21.709> you<00:02:21.770> what<00:02:22.010> it<00:02:22.100> looks<00:02:22.130> like<00:02:22.490> when

00:02:22.690 --> 00:02:22.700 
I'll show you what it looks like when

00:02:22.700 --> 00:02:24.880 
I'll show you what it looks like when
it's<00:02:22.880> mounted<00:02:23.390> and<00:02:24.140> how<00:02:24.319> easy<00:02:24.560> it<00:02:24.770> is<00:02:24.830> to

00:02:24.880 --> 00:02:24.890 
it's mounted and how easy it is to

00:02:24.890 --> 00:02:28.960 
it's mounted and how easy it is to
actually<00:02:25.160> install<00:02:25.790> but<00:02:27.310> what<00:02:28.310> I<00:02:28.340> what<00:02:28.730> I<00:02:28.760> want

00:02:28.960 --> 00:02:28.970 
actually install but what I what I want

00:02:28.970 --> 00:02:30.370 
actually install but what I what I want
to<00:02:29.030> show<00:02:29.180> you<00:02:29.240> first<00:02:29.569> off<00:02:29.780> is<00:02:30.020> that<00:02:30.200> this

00:02:30.370 --> 00:02:30.380 
to show you first off is that this

00:02:30.380 --> 00:02:33.730 
to show you first off is that this
radiator<00:02:30.920> here<00:02:31.370> it's<00:02:32.000> got<00:02:32.330> a<00:02:32.360> a<00:02:32.840> pretty<00:02:33.230> nice

00:02:33.730 --> 00:02:33.740 
radiator here it's got a a pretty nice

00:02:33.740 --> 00:02:36.340 
radiator here it's got a a pretty nice
depth<00:02:34.280> of<00:02:34.520> Finn's<00:02:35.270> here<00:02:35.450> that<00:02:35.780> creates<00:02:36.230> a

00:02:36.340 --> 00:02:36.350 
depth of Finn's here that creates a

00:02:36.350 --> 00:02:39.100 
depth of Finn's here that creates a
cooling<00:02:37.120> mechanism<00:02:38.120> the<00:02:38.570> water<00:02:38.810> is<00:02:38.930> actually

00:02:39.100 --> 00:02:39.110 
cooling mechanism the water is actually

00:02:39.110 --> 00:02:42.610 
cooling mechanism the water is actually
going<00:02:39.440> to<00:02:39.530> flow<00:02:40.250> through<00:02:40.610> here<00:02:40.880> over<00:02:41.240> this<00:02:41.870> cpu

00:02:42.610 --> 00:02:42.620 
going to flow through here over this cpu

00:02:42.620 --> 00:02:45.699 
going to flow through here over this cpu
right<00:02:43.520> on<00:02:43.670> here<00:02:44.090> and<00:02:44.290> this<00:02:45.290> is<00:02:45.440> where<00:02:45.590> the

00:02:45.699 --> 00:02:45.709 
right on here and this is where the

00:02:45.709 --> 00:02:47.229 
right on here and this is where the
cooling<00:02:46.040> is<00:02:46.130> going<00:02:46.250> to<00:02:46.310> happen<00:02:46.670> and<00:02:47.090> then

00:02:47.229 --> 00:02:47.239 
cooling is going to happen and then

00:02:47.239 --> 00:02:48.880 
cooling is going to happen and then
obviously<00:02:47.360> flow<00:02:47.840> back<00:02:48.080> through<00:02:48.110> the<00:02:48.560> radiator

00:02:48.880 --> 00:02:48.890 
obviously flow back through the radiator

00:02:48.890 --> 00:02:53.170 
obviously flow back through the radiator
and<00:02:49.480> create<00:02:50.480> a<00:02:50.510> loop<00:02:51.100> you<00:02:52.100> pretty<00:02:52.670> much<00:02:52.760> power

00:02:53.170 --> 00:02:53.180 
and create a loop you pretty much power

00:02:53.180 --> 00:02:55.780 
and create a loop you pretty much power
right<00:02:53.750> here<00:02:53.959> just<00:02:54.380> plug<00:02:54.560> that<00:02:54.620> in<00:02:55.040> you've<00:02:55.519> got

00:02:55.780 --> 00:02:55.790 
right here just plug that in you've got

00:02:55.790 --> 00:02:58.570 
right here just plug that in you've got
connectors<00:02:56.510> for<00:02:56.810> fans<00:02:57.230> which<00:02:58.130> obviously

00:02:58.570 --> 00:02:58.580 
connectors for fans which obviously

00:02:58.580 --> 00:03:00.940 
connectors for fans which obviously
these<00:02:59.450> will<00:02:59.690> be<00:02:59.780> connected<00:03:00.230> in<00:03:00.320> here<00:03:00.560> you'll

00:03:00.940 --> 00:03:00.950 
these will be connected in here you'll

00:03:00.950 --> 00:03:03.040 
these will be connected in here you'll
have<00:03:01.040> two<00:03:01.370> slots<00:03:01.700> and<00:03:02.209> you'll<00:03:02.360> have<00:03:02.450> two<00:03:02.690> extra

00:03:03.040 --> 00:03:03.050 
have two slots and you'll have two extra

00:03:03.050 --> 00:03:06.280 
have two slots and you'll have two extra
for<00:03:03.709> case<00:03:04.130> fans<00:03:04.660> everything<00:03:05.660> gets<00:03:05.810> powered

00:03:06.280 --> 00:03:06.290 
for case fans everything gets powered

00:03:06.290 --> 00:03:10.150 
for case fans everything gets powered
within<00:03:07.040> the<00:03:07.190> unit<00:03:07.519> itself<00:03:07.900> all<00:03:08.900> from<00:03:09.290> this<00:03:09.800> guy

00:03:10.150 --> 00:03:10.160 
within the unit itself all from this guy

00:03:10.160 --> 00:03:12.520 
within the unit itself all from this guy
right<00:03:10.370> here<00:03:10.430> and<00:03:10.880> then<00:03:11.870> you'll<00:03:11.989> have<00:03:12.170> you

00:03:12.520 --> 00:03:12.530 
right here and then you'll have you

00:03:12.530 --> 00:03:14.229 
right here and then you'll have you
actually<00:03:12.709> have<00:03:12.950> a<00:03:13.010> fan<00:03:13.340> controller<00:03:13.760> built<00:03:14.030> in

00:03:14.229 --> 00:03:14.239 
actually have a fan controller built in

00:03:14.239 --> 00:03:20.560 
actually have a fan controller built in
so<00:03:14.510> it's<00:03:14.930> kind<00:03:15.110> of<00:03:15.140> nice<00:03:19.329> basically<00:03:20.329> this

00:03:20.560 --> 00:03:20.570 
so it's kind of nice basically this

00:03:20.570 --> 00:03:22.509 
so it's kind of nice basically this
radiator<00:03:21.170> is<00:03:21.350> going<00:03:21.500> to<00:03:21.560> sit<00:03:21.769> on<00:03:21.920> the<00:03:22.010> case<00:03:22.250> and

00:03:22.509 --> 00:03:22.519 
radiator is going to sit on the case and

00:03:22.519 --> 00:03:24.370 
radiator is going to sit on the case and
now<00:03:23.299> you're<00:03:23.420> going<00:03:23.540> to<00:03:23.600> have<00:03:23.690> it<00:03:23.750> mounted<00:03:23.870> of

00:03:24.370 --> 00:03:24.380 
now you're going to have it mounted of

00:03:24.380 --> 00:03:28.060 
now you're going to have it mounted of
course<00:03:24.680> with<00:03:24.920> 220<00:03:25.640> millimeter<00:03:25.970> fans<00:03:26.290> this<00:03:27.290> cpu

00:03:28.060 --> 00:03:28.070 
course with 220 millimeter fans this cpu

00:03:28.070 --> 00:03:29.680 
course with 220 millimeter fans this cpu
block<00:03:28.130> basically<00:03:29.030> it's<00:03:29.150> it's<00:03:29.329> real<00:03:29.510> simple

00:03:29.680 --> 00:03:29.690 
block basically it's it's real simple

00:03:29.690 --> 00:03:30.789 
block basically it's it's real simple
it's<00:03:30.019> just<00:03:30.140> going<00:03:30.290> to<00:03:30.350> sit<00:03:30.530> on<00:03:30.650> the

00:03:30.789 --> 00:03:30.799 
it's just going to sit on the

00:03:30.799 --> 00:03:34.390 
it's just going to sit on the
motherboard<00:03:31.510> in<00:03:32.510> the<00:03:32.870> mounting<00:03:33.140> bracket<00:03:33.400> to

motherboard in the mounting bracket to
tell<00:03:34.670> is<00:03:35.390> your<00:03:35.750> AMD<00:03:36.230> obviously<00:03:37.070> however<00:03:37.340> your

00:03:37.539 --> 00:03:37.549 
tell is your AMD obviously however your

00:03:37.549 --> 00:03:40.750 
tell is your AMD obviously however your
your<00:03:38.120> board<00:03:38.360> is<00:03:38.450> set<00:03:38.630> up<00:03:38.810> and<00:03:39.489> this<00:03:40.489> is<00:03:40.640> going

00:03:40.750 --> 00:03:40.760 
your board is set up and this is going

00:03:40.760 --> 00:03:42.250 
your board is set up and this is going
to<00:03:40.850> sit<00:03:41.000> on<00:03:41.120> your<00:03:41.299> and<00:03:41.660> it's<00:03:41.870> going<00:03:41.989> to<00:03:42.049> melt

00:03:42.250 --> 00:03:42.260 
to sit on your and it's going to melt

00:03:42.260 --> 00:03:44.350 
to sit on your and it's going to melt
down<00:03:42.350> with<00:03:42.739> this<00:03:42.920> hardware<00:03:43.400> and<00:03:43.670> mount<00:03:44.209> right

00:03:44.350 --> 00:03:44.360 
down with this hardware and mount right

00:03:44.360 --> 00:03:47.080 
down with this hardware and mount right
onto<00:03:44.420> the<00:03:44.690> board<00:03:45.430> this<00:03:46.430> will<00:03:46.579> be<00:03:46.670> on<00:03:46.760> the<00:03:46.850> case

00:03:47.080 --> 00:03:47.090 
onto the board this will be on the case

00:03:47.090 --> 00:03:53.830 
onto the board this will be on the case
and<00:03:47.390> there<00:03:48.230> you<00:03:48.350> go<00:03:52.150> you<00:03:53.150> know<00:03:53.239> I<00:03:53.510> think

00:03:53.830 --> 00:03:53.840 
and there you go you know I think

00:03:53.840 --> 00:03:56.199 
and there you go you know I think
overall<00:03:54.170> this<00:03:54.769> is<00:03:54.829> a<00:03:55.010> phenomenal<00:03:55.280> cooler<00:03:55.880> and

00:03:56.199 --> 00:03:56.209 
overall this is a phenomenal cooler and

00:03:56.209 --> 00:03:58.660 
overall this is a phenomenal cooler and
I<00:03:56.840> think<00:03:57.110> anyone<00:03:57.650> who<00:03:57.950> puts<00:03:58.280> it<00:03:58.400> in<00:03:58.549> their

00:03:58.660 --> 00:03:58.670 
I think anyone who puts it in their

00:03:58.670 --> 00:04:01.449 
I think anyone who puts it in their
system<00:03:58.850> as<00:03:59.269> long<00:03:59.720> as<00:03:59.840> they<00:03:59.900> have<00:04:00.049> a<00:04:00.079> case<00:04:00.459> that

00:04:01.449 --> 00:04:01.459 
system as long as they have a case that

00:04:01.459 --> 00:04:03.550 
system as long as they have a case that
fits<00:04:01.700> it<00:04:02.030> though<00:04:02.510> we've<00:04:02.690> extremely<00:04:03.230> happy

00:04:03.550 --> 00:04:03.560 
fits it though we've extremely happy

00:04:03.560 --> 00:04:05.650 
fits it though we've extremely happy
with<00:04:03.590> it<00:04:03.920> it's<00:04:04.190> great<00:04:04.459> for<00:04:04.730> beginners<00:04:04.940> who

00:04:05.650 --> 00:04:05.660
