00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.629
 what time is it and adventure and pines daughters 

00:00:04.500 --> 00:00:09.269
 I went to pick up my copy of 

00:00:06.629 --> 00:00:11.670
 adventure time from my comics shop I have it 

00:00:09.269 --> 00:00:14.599
 taken in both normal and in 

00:00:11.670 --> 00:00:14.599
 variant version 

00:00:19.460 --> 00:00:27.029
 how nice then but I would like to do one 

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:29.820
 kind of review no more than anything else 

00:00:27.029 --> 00:00:32.850
 give you good reasons to buy the 

00:00:29.820 --> 00:00:34.649
 adventure time comic the first team 

00:00:32.850 --> 00:00:37.350
 event a time 

00:00:34.649 --> 00:00:40.649
 the second reason is who has the clariant 

00:00:37.350 --> 00:00:45.780
 peluso zza only for this reason from where it is 

00:00:40.649 --> 00:00:49.170
 beautiful skin the third reason is that there is a 

00:00:45.780 --> 00:00:51.660
 secret message of mars ii and the fourth 

00:00:49.170 --> 00:00:55.410
 reason is that in the variant they are 

00:00:51.660 --> 00:00:58.559
 surrounded by di verden jensen brothers 

00:00:55.410 --> 00:01:00.660
 and the fifth reason is that it is well certan e 

00:00:58.559 --> 00:01:02.399
 so you don't really need reasons for 

00:01:00.660 --> 00:01:03.629
 tell you to buy it 

00:01:02.399 --> 00:01:07.830
 I tried to review it 

00:01:03.629 --> 00:01:10.350
 series a of the first volume but if you know 

00:01:07.830 --> 00:01:14.820
 the 28-year-old already knows what you're up to 

00:01:10.350 --> 00:01:17.040
 meeting is simply this one 

00:01:14.820 --> 00:01:19.470
 what i can tell you is that there is 

00:01:17.040 --> 00:01:21.390
 a main story and then of the others 

00:01:19.470 --> 00:01:26.700
 extra very nice chapters a lot 

00:01:21.390 --> 00:01:31.130
 more fun and some few 

00:01:26.700 --> 00:01:33.320
 information on the back that covers 

00:01:31.130 --> 00:01:35.640
 for the first two volumes 

00:01:33.320 --> 00:01:39.299
 now I wonder but also second 

00:01:35.640 --> 00:01:42.869
 volume the variant uses the normal fast 

00:01:39.299 --> 00:01:48.210
 it costs 2 90 while the luxurious one 

00:01:42.869 --> 00:01:50.070
 varying costs 5 euros costs 5 euros and vi 

00:01:48.210 --> 00:01:53.070
 apparently the doctor can also be found 

00:01:50.070 --> 00:01:55.320
 I really don't know what to say to you anymore 

00:01:53.070 --> 00:01:57.210
 buy losail you know in time if 

00:01:55.320 --> 00:01:59.040
 you like it damaged in buy it if 

00:01:57.210 --> 00:02:01.860
 you don't know adventure time always 

00:01:59.040 --> 00:02:06.330
 sad people and you have to buy it 

00:02:01.860 --> 00:02:08.369
 therefore excuse me for this sclero 

00:02:06.330 --> 00:02:10.050
 just a video or explained so why 

00:02:08.369 --> 00:02:13.710
 I was very happy with this purchase 

00:02:10.050 --> 00:02:15.450
 gone actively to the jetty exists 

00:02:13.710 --> 00:02:17.760
 as a sentence actively successful not 

00:02:15.450 --> 00:02:20.490
 I know, however, that's fine for this 

00:02:17.760 --> 00:02:22.740
 he writes everything lasted very little but it is 

00:02:20.490 --> 00:02:25.100
 better this way because you have more time 

00:02:22.740 --> 00:02:27.690
 to go and buy a glass time e 

00:02:25.100 --> 00:02:29.160
 let me know what you think if you have 

00:02:27.690 --> 00:02:31.490
 bought if you are not going with 

00:02:29.160 --> 00:02:34.490
 words so if people are sad and 

00:02:31.490 --> 00:02:34.490
 anything
