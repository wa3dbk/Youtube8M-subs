lights pretty big as you can clearly see

00:00:12.420 --> 00:00:13.459 
lights pretty big as you can clearly see
here<00:00:12.660> and<00:00:12.750> i'll<00:00:12.809> be<00:00:12.929> showing<00:00:13.110> you<00:00:13.290> them

00:00:13.459 --> 00:00:13.469 
here and i'll be showing you them

00:00:13.469 --> 00:00:15.289 
here and i'll be showing you them
individually<00:00:14.009> in<00:00:14.370> a<00:00:14.429> minute<00:00:14.700> but<00:00:14.880> basically

00:00:15.289 --> 00:00:15.299 
individually in a minute but basically

00:00:15.299 --> 00:00:17.240 
individually in a minute but basically
they're<00:00:16.139> from<00:00:16.410> sound<00:00:16.710> off<00:00:16.859> and<00:00:17.130> of<00:00:17.220> course

00:00:17.240 --> 00:00:17.250 
they're from sound off and of course

00:00:17.250 --> 00:00:19.820 
they're from sound off and of course
they're<00:00:17.550> available<00:00:17.730> on<00:00:18.029> siren<00:00:18.630> net<00:00:18.750> now<00:00:19.380> the

00:00:19.820 --> 00:00:19.830 
they're available on siren net now the

00:00:19.830 --> 00:00:21.650 
they're available on siren net now the
difference<00:00:20.039> between<00:00:20.580> these<00:00:20.880> light<00:00:21.150> heads<00:00:21.420> are

00:00:21.650 --> 00:00:21.660 
difference between these light heads are

00:00:21.660 --> 00:00:24.320 
difference between these light heads are
essentially<00:00:22.619> the<00:00:22.650> amount<00:00:23.460> of<00:00:23.640> lumens<00:00:24.119> that

00:00:24.320 --> 00:00:24.330 
essentially the amount of lumens that

00:00:24.330 --> 00:00:26.210 
essentially the amount of lumens that
they're<00:00:24.449> going<00:00:24.570> to<00:00:24.660> put<00:00:24.930> out<00:00:25.109> so<00:00:25.800> the<00:00:25.949> first

00:00:26.210 --> 00:00:26.220 
they're going to put out so the first

00:00:26.220 --> 00:00:28.310 
they're going to put out so the first
light<00:00:26.369> hat<00:00:26.580> I'm<00:00:26.699> going<00:00:26.880> to<00:00:26.939> hold<00:00:27.119> up<00:00:27.300> puts<00:00:28.140> out

00:00:28.310 --> 00:00:28.320 
light hat I'm going to hold up puts out

00:00:28.320 --> 00:00:31.640 
light hat I'm going to hold up puts out
two<00:00:28.800> thousand<00:00:29.310> two<00:00:29.609> hundred<00:00:29.640> lumens<00:00:30.500> put<00:00:31.500> that

00:00:31.640 --> 00:00:31.650 
two thousand two hundred lumens put that

00:00:31.650 --> 00:00:33.560 
two thousand two hundred lumens put that
down<00:00:31.800> there<00:00:31.980> the<00:00:32.669> next<00:00:32.790> one<00:00:33.059> I'm<00:00:33.180> holding<00:00:33.329> up

00:00:33.560 --> 00:00:33.570 
down there the next one I'm holding up

00:00:33.570 --> 00:00:38.690 
down there the next one I'm holding up
puts<00:00:34.260> out<00:00:34.489> 3000<00:00:35.489> lumens<00:00:35.640> and<00:00:37.370> the<00:00:38.370> next<00:00:38.520> one

00:00:38.690 --> 00:00:38.700 
puts out 3000 lumens and the next one

00:00:38.700 --> 00:00:39.920 
puts out 3000 lumens and the next one
I'm<00:00:38.790> going<00:00:38.879> to<00:00:38.940> reach<00:00:39.270> over<00:00:39.510> here<00:00:39.690> and<00:00:39.809> you'll

00:00:39.920 --> 00:00:39.930 
I'm going to reach over here and you'll

00:00:39.930 --> 00:00:41.990 
I'm going to reach over here and you'll
get<00:00:40.020> a<00:00:40.050> good<00:00:40.230> workout<00:00:40.440> hold<00:00:41.010> this<00:00:41.160> one<00:00:41.309> up<00:00:41.370> that

00:00:41.990 --> 00:00:42.000 
get a good workout hold this one up that

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:45.770 
get a good workout hold this one up that
puts<00:00:42.300> out<00:00:42.530> 4,000<00:00:43.530> lumens<00:00:43.860> so<00:00:44.070> again<00:00:44.399> the<00:00:45.300> light

00:00:45.770 --> 00:00:45.780 
puts out 4,000 lumens so again the light

00:00:45.780 --> 00:00:47.630 
puts out 4,000 lumens so again the light
heads<00:00:45.989> themselves<00:00:46.140> have<00:00:46.739> got<00:00:46.980> a<00:00:47.160> different

00:00:47.630 --> 00:00:47.640 
heads themselves have got a different

00:00:47.640 --> 00:00:49.760 
heads themselves have got a different
lumen<00:00:48.120> rating<00:00:48.690> so<00:00:48.930> you<00:00:49.050> can<00:00:49.200> check<00:00:49.379> this<00:00:49.559> out

00:00:49.760 --> 00:00:49.770 
lumen rating so you can check this out

00:00:49.770 --> 00:00:51.350 
lumen rating so you can check this out
on<00:00:49.800> the<00:00:50.190> website<00:00:50.640> and<00:00:50.760> I'll<00:00:50.879> go<00:00:51.000> into<00:00:51.149> the

00:00:51.350 --> 00:00:51.360 
on the website and I'll go into the

00:00:51.360 --> 00:00:53.389 
on the website and I'll go into the
individual<00:00:52.230> information<00:00:52.410> with<00:00:52.980> respect<00:00:53.100> to

in a deep dish reflector you can see

00:01:55.979 --> 00:01:57.740 
in a deep dish reflector you can see
that<00:01:56.009> here<00:01:56.579> clearly<00:01:56.939> it<00:01:57.119> kind<00:01:57.270> of<00:01:57.299> angular

00:01:57.740 --> 00:01:57.750 
that here clearly it kind of angular

00:01:57.750 --> 00:02:00.380 
that here clearly it kind of angular
that's<00:01:57.899> quite<00:01:58.049> a<00:01:58.079> nice<00:01:58.290> one<00:01:58.469> and<00:01:58.759> again<00:01:59.759> as<00:01:59.939> the

00:02:00.380 --> 00:02:00.390 
that's quite a nice one and again as the

00:02:00.390 --> 00:02:03.080 
that's quite a nice one and again as the
lumen<00:02:01.140> size<00:02:01.409> increases<00:02:02.159> so<00:02:02.729> there's<00:02:03.000> the

00:02:03.080 --> 00:02:03.090 
lumen size increases so there's the

00:02:03.090 --> 00:02:05.179 
lumen size increases so there's the
number<00:02:03.390> of<00:02:03.570> panels<00:02:03.869> so<00:02:04.259> again<00:02:04.530> six<00:02:04.890> and<00:02:05.070> this

00:02:05.179 --> 00:02:05.189 
number of panels so again six and this

00:02:05.189 --> 00:02:10.559 
number of panels so again six and this
one<00:02:07.520> for<00:02:08.520> in<00:02:08.700> this<00:02:08.849> one

00:02:10.559 --> 00:02:10.569 
one for in this one

00:02:10.569 --> 00:02:14.640 
one for in this one
and<00:02:10.769> then<00:02:11.769> six<00:02:12.099> over<00:02:12.819> here<00:02:13.239> now<00:02:14.019> I<00:02:14.230> can<00:02:14.499> turn

00:02:14.640 --> 00:02:14.650 
and then six over here now I can turn

00:02:14.650 --> 00:02:15.989 
and then six over here now I can turn
these<00:02:14.769> on<00:02:14.920> in<00:02:15.099> the<00:02:15.159> studio<00:02:15.519> and<00:02:15.700> of<00:02:15.819> course

00:02:15.989 --> 00:02:15.999 
these on in the studio and of course

00:02:15.999 --> 00:02:17.220 
these on in the studio and of course
they're<00:02:16.120> going<00:02:16.269> to<00:02:16.329> look<00:02:16.420> incredibly<00:02:16.900> bright

00:02:17.220 --> 00:02:17.230 
they're going to look incredibly bright

00:02:17.230 --> 00:02:19.410 
they're going to look incredibly bright
but<00:02:17.560> outside<00:02:18.159> is<00:02:18.459> where<00:02:18.790> it's<00:02:18.909> going<00:02:18.999> to<00:02:19.090> count

00:02:19.410 --> 00:02:19.420 
but outside is where it's going to count

00:02:19.420 --> 00:02:20.879 
but outside is where it's going to count
and<00:02:19.629> we<00:02:19.810> will<00:02:19.989> be<00:02:20.109> showing<00:02:20.379> these<00:02:20.560> lights

00:02:20.879 --> 00:02:20.889 
and we will be showing these lights

00:02:20.889 --> 00:02:23.220 
and we will be showing these lights
outside<00:02:21.189> but<00:02:22.180> I<00:02:22.209> will<00:02:22.450> turn<00:02:22.599> them<00:02:22.780> on<00:02:22.870> briefly

00:02:23.220 --> 00:02:23.230 
outside but I will turn them on briefly

00:02:23.230 --> 00:02:25.199 
outside but I will turn them on briefly
in<00:02:23.469> the<00:02:23.650> studio<00:02:24.010> and<00:02:24.280> again<00:02:24.730> all<00:02:24.879> the<00:02:24.999> tech

00:02:25.199 --> 00:02:25.209 
in the studio and again all the tech

00:02:25.209 --> 00:02:27.449 
in the studio and again all the tech
specs<00:02:25.450> on<00:02:25.749> each<00:02:26.230> of<00:02:26.379> the<00:02:26.439> lights<00:02:26.650> are<00:02:26.829> similar

00:02:27.449 --> 00:02:27.459 
specs on each of the lights are similar

00:02:27.459 --> 00:02:29.520 
specs on each of the lights are similar
with<00:02:27.639> certain<00:02:28.480> differences<00:02:28.870> and<00:02:29.170> that

00:02:29.520 --> 00:02:29.530 
with certain differences and that

00:02:29.530 --> 00:02:32.099 
with certain differences and that
relates<00:02:29.920> to<00:02:30.219> the<00:02:30.400> amp<00:02:30.609> draw<00:02:31.060> the<00:02:31.629> after<00:02:32.019> all

00:02:32.099 --> 00:02:32.109 
relates to the amp draw the after all

00:02:32.109 --> 00:02:34.709 
relates to the amp draw the after all
will<00:02:32.319> adjust<00:02:32.709> depending<00:02:33.250> on<00:02:33.819> the<00:02:34.030> lumens<00:02:34.450> ie

00:02:34.709 --> 00:02:34.719 
will adjust depending on the lumens ie

00:02:34.719 --> 00:02:37.229 
will adjust depending on the lumens ie
the<00:02:35.139> amount<00:02:35.469> of<00:02:35.560> diodes<00:02:36.549> that<00:02:36.760> are<00:02:36.849> actually

00:02:37.229 --> 00:02:37.239 
the amount of diodes that are actually

00:02:37.239 --> 00:02:39.149 
the amount of diodes that are actually
in<00:02:37.389> the<00:02:37.659> light<00:02:37.870> the<00:02:38.169> greater<00:02:38.560> they<00:02:38.799> are<00:02:38.950> the

00:02:39.149 --> 00:02:39.159 
in the light the greater they are the

00:02:39.159 --> 00:02:41.339 
in the light the greater they are the
higher<00:02:39.340> the<00:02:39.519> amp<00:02:39.730> draw<00:02:39.879> the<00:02:40.030> lower<00:02:40.900> the<00:02:41.169> number

00:02:41.339 --> 00:02:41.349 
higher the amp draw the lower the number

00:02:41.349 --> 00:02:44.339 
higher the amp draw the lower the number
the<00:02:41.530> less<00:02:42.189> the<00:02:42.430> amp<00:02:42.579> draw<00:02:42.790> and<00:02:43.090> again<00:02:43.810> each<00:02:44.139> of

00:02:44.339 --> 00:02:44.349 
the less the amp draw and again each of

00:02:44.349 --> 00:02:45.569 
the less the amp draw and again each of
these<00:02:44.409> lights<00:02:44.650> do<00:02:44.859> come<00:02:45.069> with<00:02:45.250> reverse

00:02:45.569 --> 00:02:45.579 
these lights do come with reverse

00:02:45.579 --> 00:02:46.979 
these lights do come with reverse
polarity<00:02:45.909> protection<00:02:46.120> so<00:02:46.780> if<00:02:46.900> you

00:02:46.979 --> 00:02:46.989 
polarity protection so if you

00:02:46.989 --> 00:02:49.349 
polarity protection so if you
inadvertently<00:02:47.549> why<00:02:48.549> them<00:02:48.760> wrong<00:02:48.969> they're<00:02:49.239> not

00:02:49.349 --> 00:02:49.359 
inadvertently why them wrong they're not

00:02:49.359 --> 00:02:51.420 
inadvertently why them wrong they're not
going<00:02:49.449> to<00:02:49.540> damage<00:02:49.689> the<00:02:49.959> diodes<00:02:50.349> but<00:02:51.099> let<00:02:51.280> me<00:02:51.310> go

00:02:51.420 --> 00:02:51.430 
going to damage the diodes but let me go

00:02:51.430 --> 00:02:52.920 
going to damage the diodes but let me go
ahead<00:02:51.519> and<00:02:51.639> turn<00:02:51.849> them<00:02:52.030> on<00:02:52.150> in<00:02:52.389> each

00:02:52.920 --> 00:02:52.930 
ahead and turn them on in each

00:02:52.930 --> 00:02:54.420 
ahead and turn them on in each
individually<00:02:53.650> and<00:02:53.769> you<00:02:53.889> get<00:02:54.010> a<00:02:54.040> chance<00:02:54.250> to

00:02:54.420 --> 00:02:54.430 
individually and you get a chance to

00:02:54.430 --> 00:02:56.459 
individually and you get a chance to
check<00:02:54.489> it<00:02:54.730> out<00:02:54.849> well<00:02:55.629> first<00:02:55.870> off<00:02:56.079> the<00:02:56.290> bat

00:02:56.459 --> 00:02:56.469 
check it out well first off the bat

00:02:56.469 --> 00:02:58.589 
check it out well first off the bat
happens<00:02:56.949> to<00:02:57.040> be<00:02:57.159> the<00:02:57.310> 2200<00:02:58.150> let's<00:02:58.389> go<00:02:58.540> ahead

00:02:58.589 --> 00:02:58.599 
happens to be the 2200 let's go ahead

00:02:58.599 --> 00:03:01.020 
happens to be the 2200 let's go ahead
and<00:02:58.689> switch<00:02:58.930> that<00:02:59.049> on<00:02:59.109> and<00:02:59.730> as<00:03:00.730> you<00:03:00.879> can<00:03:01.000> see

00:03:01.020 --> 00:03:01.030 
and switch that on and as you can see

00:03:01.030 --> 00:03:03.209 
and switch that on and as you can see
the<00:03:01.959> world<00:03:02.169> has<00:03:02.349> ended<00:03:02.469> for<00:03:02.620> the<00:03:02.739> camera<00:03:03.010> crew

00:03:03.209 --> 00:03:03.219 
the world has ended for the camera crew

00:03:03.219 --> 00:03:04.140 
the world has ended for the camera crew
and<00:03:03.250> believe<00:03:03.609> me<00:03:03.730> it's<00:03:03.819> going<00:03:03.939> to<00:03:04.000> get<00:03:04.060> worse

00:03:04.140 --> 00:03:04.150 
and believe me it's going to get worse

00:03:04.150 --> 00:03:09.360 
and believe me it's going to get worse
you<00:03:05.079> can<00:03:05.319> see<00:03:05.590> here<00:03:06.329> the<00:03:07.349> wide<00:03:08.349> angle<00:03:08.769> this

mama hits bright so get in the studio
area<00:03:23.079> here<00:03:23.319> and<00:03:23.349> I'm<00:03:23.470> kind<00:03:23.650> of<00:03:23.680> shining<00:03:24.040> it

00:03:24.119 --> 00:03:24.129 
area here and I'm kind of shining it

00:03:24.129 --> 00:03:26.219 
area here and I'm kind of shining it
around<00:03:24.340> the<00:03:24.459> building<00:03:24.939> that<00:03:25.569> we<00:03:25.750> are<00:03:25.930> if<00:03:26.109> I

00:03:26.219 --> 00:03:26.229 
around the building that we are if I

00:03:26.229 --> 00:03:27.569 
around the building that we are if I
kind<00:03:26.409> of<00:03:26.470> swing<00:03:26.739> it<00:03:26.859> if<00:03:27.009> I<00:03:27.099> can<00:03:27.220> do<00:03:27.310> this<00:03:27.430> we

00:03:27.569 --> 00:03:27.579 
kind of swing it if I can do this we

00:03:27.579 --> 00:03:29.460 
kind of swing it if I can do this we
turn<00:03:27.729> it<00:03:27.819> backwards<00:03:28.060> can<00:03:28.780> you<00:03:28.840> see<00:03:29.049> you<00:03:29.199> can

00:03:29.460 --> 00:03:29.470 
turn it backwards can you see you can

00:03:29.470 --> 00:03:31.619 
turn it backwards can you see you can
actually<00:03:29.709> I'm<00:03:30.430> looking<00:03:30.669> at<00:03:30.970> the<00:03:31.120> monitor<00:03:31.299> but

00:03:31.619 --> 00:03:31.629 
actually I'm looking at the monitor but

00:03:31.629 --> 00:03:33.240 
actually I'm looking at the monitor but
you<00:03:31.720> can<00:03:31.870> see<00:03:32.079> here<00:03:32.319> in<00:03:32.379> broad<00:03:32.590> daylight<00:03:32.889> it's

00:03:33.240 --> 00:03:33.250 
you can see here in broad daylight it's

00:03:33.250 --> 00:03:35.159 
you can see here in broad daylight it's
a<00:03:33.280> beautiful<00:03:33.699> sunny<00:03:34.239> day<00:03:34.389> in<00:03:34.689> the<00:03:34.780> Pacific

00:03:35.159 --> 00:03:35.169 
a beautiful sunny day in the Pacific

00:03:35.169 --> 00:03:37.589 
a beautiful sunny day in the Pacific
Northwest<00:03:35.220> you<00:03:36.220> can<00:03:36.400> clearly<00:03:36.639> see<00:03:36.939> the<00:03:36.970> light

00:03:37.589 --> 00:03:37.599 
Northwest you can clearly see the light

00:03:37.599 --> 00:03:40.530 
Northwest you can clearly see the light
bouncing<00:03:38.349> off<00:03:38.379> the<00:03:38.560> far<00:03:39.280> back<00:03:39.699> wall<00:03:40.030> here<00:03:40.389> on

00:03:40.530 --> 00:03:40.540 
bouncing off the far back wall here on

00:03:40.540 --> 00:03:42.390 
bouncing off the far back wall here on
the<00:03:41.169> main<00:03:41.319> studio<00:03:41.590> I'm<00:03:41.799> gonna<00:03:41.949> swing<00:03:42.159> it<00:03:42.220> back

00:03:42.390 --> 00:03:42.400 
the main studio I'm gonna swing it back

00:03:42.400 --> 00:03:45.229 
the main studio I'm gonna swing it back
around<00:03:42.729> again<00:03:42.939> so<00:03:43.900> this<00:03:44.019> is<00:03:44.049> 3,000<00:03:44.769> lumen<00:03:45.009> and

00:03:45.229 --> 00:03:45.239 
around again so this is 3,000 lumen and

00:03:45.239 --> 00:03:49.649 
around again so this is 3,000 lumen and
again<00:03:46.239> this<00:03:46.389> is<00:03:46.569> a<00:03:46.889> flood<00:03:47.889> seen<00:03:48.549> light<00:03:48.759> the

00:03:49.649 --> 00:03:49.659 
again this is a flood seen light the

00:03:49.659 --> 00:03:50.759 
again this is a flood seen light the
nice<00:03:49.780> thing<00:03:49.810> about<00:03:50.019> these<00:03:50.259> lights<00:03:50.500> of<00:03:50.620> course

00:03:50.759 --> 00:03:50.769 
nice thing about these lights of course

00:03:50.769 --> 00:03:52.259 
nice thing about these lights of course
they<00:03:50.949> are<00:03:51.009> definitely<00:03:51.759> going<00:03:51.849> to<00:03:51.939> be<00:03:52.000> able<00:03:52.060> to

00:03:52.259 --> 00:03:52.269 
they are definitely going to be able to

00:03:52.269 --> 00:03:54.089 
they are definitely going to be able to
well<00:03:52.449> take<00:03:52.720> the<00:03:52.750> weather<00:03:53.109> there<00:03:53.319> in<00:03:53.469> a<00:03:53.590> cast

00:03:54.089 --> 00:03:54.099 
well take the weather there in a cast

00:03:54.099 --> 00:03:57.659 
well take the weather there in a cast
aluminum<00:03:54.900> housing<00:03:55.900> with<00:03:56.709> a<00:03:56.739> very<00:03:57.009> nice<00:03:57.189> thin

00:03:57.659 --> 00:03:57.669 
aluminum housing with a very nice thin

00:03:57.669 --> 00:03:59.369 
aluminum housing with a very nice thin
at<00:03:57.819> the<00:03:57.849> back<00:03:58.090> here<00:03:58.329> that<00:03:58.359> helps<00:03:58.780> dissipate

00:03:59.369 --> 00:03:59.379 
at the back here that helps dissipate

00:03:59.379 --> 00:04:01.830 
at the back here that helps dissipate
the<00:03:59.590> heat<00:03:59.949> that<00:04:00.519> these<00:04:00.969> lights<00:04:01.209> will<00:04:01.329> generate

00:04:01.830 --> 00:04:01.840 
the heat that these lights will generate

00:04:01.840 --> 00:04:04.619 
the heat that these lights will generate
and<00:04:02.169> of<00:04:02.650> course<00:04:02.859> very<00:04:03.159> sturdy<00:04:03.549> ability<00:04:04.389> here

00:04:04.619 --> 00:04:04.629 
and of course very sturdy ability here

00:04:04.629 --> 00:04:06.779 
and of course very sturdy ability here
to<00:04:05.049> mount<00:04:05.349> them<00:04:05.590> onto<00:04:06.009> the<00:04:06.069> surface<00:04:06.459> area<00:04:06.669> that

00:04:06.779 --> 00:04:06.789 
to mount them onto the surface area that

00:04:06.789 --> 00:04:10.289 
to mount them onto the surface area that
you<00:04:06.879> decide<00:04:07.180> to<00:04:07.359> do<00:04:07.509> that<00:04:09.030> now<00:04:10.030> i'm<00:04:10.120> going<00:04:10.239> to

00:04:10.289 --> 00:04:10.299 
you decide to do that now i'm going to

00:04:10.299 --> 00:04:15.709 
you decide to do that now i'm going to
go<00:04:10.359> ahead<00:04:10.389> and<00:04:10.629> turn<00:04:10.840> on<00:04:11.079> the<00:04:11.459> 4000<00:04:12.459> lumen<00:04:14.009> and

00:04:15.709 --> 00:04:15.719 
go ahead and turn on the 4000 lumen and

00:04:15.719 --> 00:04:18.569 
go ahead and turn on the 4000 lumen and
we<00:04:16.719> can<00:04:16.959> we<00:04:17.620> can<00:04:17.739> see<00:04:17.889> that<00:04:18.070> this<00:04:18.159> is<00:04:18.310> right<00:04:18.549> i

00:04:18.569 --> 00:04:18.579 
we can we can see that this is right i

00:04:18.579 --> 00:04:21.599 
we can we can see that this is right i
think<00:04:18.789> it's<00:04:19.029> safe<00:04:19.209> to<00:04:19.239> say

00:04:21.599 --> 00:04:21.609 

00:04:21.609 --> 00:04:23.850 

and<00:04:22.210> again<00:04:22.449> I'm<00:04:22.539> going<00:04:22.659> to<00:04:22.860> unscientifically

00:04:23.850 --> 00:04:23.860 
and again I'm going to unscientifically

00:04:23.860 --> 00:04:26.369 
and again I'm going to unscientifically
shine<00:04:24.189> it<00:04:24.340> against<00:04:24.669> the<00:04:24.819> far<00:04:25.419> wall<00:04:25.479> here<00:04:26.199> and

00:04:26.369 --> 00:04:26.379 
shine it against the far wall here and

00:04:26.379 --> 00:04:28.800 
shine it against the far wall here and
you<00:04:27.280> can<00:04:27.520> you<00:04:27.819> can<00:04:28.030> see<00:04:28.240> I've<00:04:28.360> actually<00:04:28.539> move

00:04:28.800 --> 00:04:28.810 
you can you can see I've actually move

00:04:28.810 --> 00:04:30.179 
you can you can see I've actually move
it<00:04:28.930> around<00:04:28.990> in<00:04:29.349> fact<00:04:29.530> that<00:04:29.710> kind<00:04:29.860> of<00:04:29.919> the<00:04:30.009> back

00:04:30.179 --> 00:04:30.189 
it around in fact that kind of the back

00:04:30.189 --> 00:04:31.529 
it around in fact that kind of the back
end<00:04:30.219> plumbing<00:04:30.909> there<00:04:31.060> you<00:04:31.150> can<00:04:31.270> kind<00:04:31.419> of<00:04:31.479> see

00:04:31.529 --> 00:04:31.539 
end plumbing there you can kind of see

00:04:31.539 --> 00:04:33.390 
end plumbing there you can kind of see
it<00:04:31.689> flicking<00:04:32.020> off<00:04:32.110> the<00:04:32.259> back<00:04:32.409> wall<00:04:32.590> and<00:04:32.979> again

00:04:33.390 --> 00:04:33.400 
it flicking off the back wall and again

00:04:33.400 --> 00:04:37.399 
it flicking off the back wall and again
it's<00:04:33.520> a<00:04:33.580> very<00:04:33.909> very<00:04:34.120> bright<00:04:34.900> day<00:04:35.229> here<00:04:35.590> and

00:04:37.399 --> 00:04:37.409 
it's a very very bright day here and

00:04:37.409 --> 00:04:43.320 
it's a very very bright day here and
spin<00:04:38.409> it<00:04:38.439> back<00:04:38.650> around<00:04:40.469> so<00:04:41.469> you<00:04:42.069> have<00:04:42.400> an

00:04:43.320 --> 00:04:43.330 
spin it back around so you have an

00:04:43.330 --> 00:04:45.869 
spin it back around so you have an
almost<00:04:43.539> drop<00:04:43.810> of<00:04:43.930> it<00:04:44.020> so<00:04:44.830> you<00:04:44.919> have<00:04:45.250> the<00:04:45.610> whole
