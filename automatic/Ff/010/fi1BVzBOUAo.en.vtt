00:05:06.460 --> 00:05:06.470 

00:05:06.470 --> 00:05:08.560 

I'm<00:05:06.980> gonna<00:05:07.100> kit<00:05:07.460> I<00:05:07.640> actually<00:05:07.850> take<00:05:08.420> the<00:05:08.540> time

00:05:08.560 --> 00:05:08.570 
I'm gonna kit I actually take the time

00:05:08.570 --> 00:05:09.820 
I'm gonna kit I actually take the time
to<00:05:08.870> get<00:05:08.990> more<00:05:09.080> hell<00:05:09.230> because<00:05:09.380> I<00:05:09.530> don't<00:05:09.650> want<00:05:09.680> to

00:05:09.820 --> 00:05:09.830 
to get more hell because I don't want to

00:05:09.830 --> 00:05:18.660 
to get more hell because I don't want to
die<00:05:13.150> this<00:05:14.150> is<00:05:14.330> going<00:05:14.930> like<00:05:15.320> really<00:05:15.890> funny

00:05:18.660 --> 00:05:18.670 

00:05:18.670 --> 00:05:25.100 

there<00:05:19.300> we<00:05:19.630> go<00:05:20.070> see<00:05:21.070> this<00:05:21.190> one<00:05:21.340> isn't<00:05:21.610> too<00:05:21.730> bad

00:05:25.100 --> 00:05:25.110 

00:05:25.110 --> 00:05:30.270 

just<00:05:28.020> if<00:05:29.020> you<00:05:29.350> spend<00:05:29.620> too<00:05:29.740> much<00:05:29.830> time<00:05:29.890> in<00:05:30.160> one

00:05:30.270 --> 00:05:30.280 
just if you spend too much time in one

00:05:30.280 --> 00:05:33.450 
just if you spend too much time in one
area<00:05:30.550> you'll<00:05:30.970> feel<00:05:31.240> it<00:05:31.480> but<00:05:32.160> other<00:05:33.160> than<00:05:33.400> that

00:05:33.450 --> 00:05:33.460 
area you'll feel it but other than that

00:05:33.460 --> 00:05:38.040 
area you'll feel it but other than that
it's<00:05:34.110> really<00:05:35.110> not<00:05:35.380> tuned<00:05:36.100> off<00:05:36.690> like<00:05:37.690> I<00:05:37.810> said

00:05:38.040 --> 00:05:38.050 
it's really not tuned off like I said

00:05:38.050 --> 00:05:39.840 
it's really not tuned off like I said
I'm<00:05:38.320> gonna<00:05:38.440> get<00:05:38.710> the<00:05:38.830> secret<00:05:39.130> star<00:05:39.430> later

00:05:39.840 --> 00:05:39.850 
I'm gonna get the secret star later

00:05:39.850 --> 00:05:42.060 
I'm gonna get the secret star later
probably<00:05:40.630> lump<00:05:40.900> it<00:05:41.020> with<00:05:41.140> the<00:05:41.200> trial<00:05:41.470> galaxies

00:05:42.060 --> 00:05:42.070 
probably lump it with the trial galaxies

00:05:42.070 --> 00:05:43.590 
probably lump it with the trial galaxies
but<00:05:42.460> I'm<00:05:42.580> definitely<00:05:42.790> going<00:05:43.120> to<00:05:43.210> get<00:05:43.270> violent

00:05:43.590 --> 00:05:43.600 
but I'm definitely going to get violent

00:05:43.600 --> 00:05:45.180 
but I'm definitely going to get violent
oast<00:05:43.840> game<00:05:44.140> when<00:05:44.380> I<00:05:44.410> have<00:05:44.590> more<00:05:44.770> time<00:05:44.830> to

00:05:45.180 --> 00:05:45.190 
oast game when I have more time to

00:05:45.190 --> 00:05:49.110 
oast game when I have more time to
record<00:05:45.960> so<00:05:46.960> next<00:05:47.530> time<00:05:47.820> we're<00:05:48.820> going<00:05:48.970> to

00:05:49.110 --> 00:05:49.120 
record so next time we're going to

00:05:49.120 --> 00:05:51.120 
record so next time we're going to
tackle<00:05:49.810> the<00:05:50.020> final<00:05:50.320> normal<00:05:50.620> galaxies<00:05:51.010> in<00:05:51.100> the

00:05:51.120 --> 00:05:51.130 
tackle the final normal galaxies in the

00:05:51.130 --> 00:05:53.370 
tackle the final normal galaxies in the
game
