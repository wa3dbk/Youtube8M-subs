Capture One Pro 7 has numerous 
ways to search for and locate images 

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:12.300
in your catalog or session.

00:00:12.300 --> 00:00:17.000
Filtered images are always 
displayed in the thumbnail browser.

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:20.500
The library tool temp

00:00:20.500 --> 00:00:23.500
which is useful for global 
searches or groupings.

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:34.000
To filter by this method the images 
need to have had color tags 

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:36.000
or star ratings applied to them.

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:39.800
Ratings and color tags can be added 
in either the viewer or the thumbnail 

00:00:39.800 --> 00:00:42.300

00:01:05.500 --> 00:01:08.300
has a numerical value to the right of it.

00:01:08.300 --> 00:01:12.000
This represents how many 
images fulfill that criteria.

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:15.000
Clicking to the right of the 
number will then filter the results

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:19.000
