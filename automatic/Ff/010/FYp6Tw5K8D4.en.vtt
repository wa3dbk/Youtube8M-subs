00:00:01.099 --> 00:00:04.779
 throughout history the bells have played so much a role 

00:00:04.779 --> 00:00:08.790
 ceremonial practice the village bells sounded to mark the time and 

00:00:08.790 --> 00:00:12.270
 warn of some danger those of the church were used to summon the 

00:00:12.270 --> 00:00:13.459
 faithful 

00:00:13.459 --> 00:00:17.400
 traditionally the bells are made of bronze a metal that is durable 

00:00:17.400 --> 00:00:20.400
 at the same time it is not logical 

00:00:25.880 --> 00:00:29.509
 the bells would not move nor would the bell 

00:00:29.509 --> 00:00:32.800
 and only with a quality goal can a good campaign be done 

00:00:33.540 --> 00:00:37.800
 they make the mold using a pattern this particular bell will carry some 

00:00:37.800 --> 00:00:41.640
 decorative lines on the surface for which another mold is necessary 

00:00:41.640 --> 00:00:44.040
 five sections 

00:00:44.040 --> 00:00:47.770
 after greasing the surface with a smolt agent before placing a 

00:00:47.770 --> 00:00:49.640
 wooden deck around 

00:00:49.640 --> 00:00:53.500
 it is covered contains a mixture of fine siliceous sand and epochs and for 

00:00:53.500 --> 00:00:55.710
 manufacture the mold 

00:00:55.710 --> 00:00:59.700
 the operators pour the mixture between the mold and the cover and the compaction 

00:01:00.480 --> 00:01:05.120
 the epoxy sets in ten minutes and now they have a sand mold with which 

00:01:05.120 --> 00:01:07.260
 they will make the ornaments of the bell 

00:01:07.260 --> 00:01:11.640
 but they still need a mold to make the steeple they do with this 

00:01:11.640 --> 00:01:13.060
 aluminum model 

00:01:13.060 --> 00:01:17.450
 after spraying it inside and out with a smoldering agent they cover it with the 

00:01:17.450 --> 00:01:20.450
 mold for ornaments that have just prepared them 

00:01:20.970 --> 00:01:24.510
 then put the set in a steel cover to pour the mixture 

00:01:24.510 --> 00:01:27.510
 of sand 

00:01:33.550 --> 00:01:37.240
 operators compact the sand mixture and wait for it to set 

00:01:41.380 --> 00:01:45.899
 they go around the deck and yesterday in one more section where they will pour more 

00:01:45.899 --> 00:01:47.630
 sand mixture 

00:01:47.630 --> 00:01:52.210
 but before adding more sand inserted in what is known as input 

00:01:52.210 --> 00:01:56.430
 this aluminum bar gives shape to the channel through which the bronze will be poured 

00:01:56.430 --> 00:01:59.430
 melted in the mold cavity 

00:02:00.620 --> 00:02:03.620
 everything is ready to add more sand 

00:02:05.460 --> 00:02:10.590
 then they remove part of the sand around the central channel to 

00:02:10.590 --> 00:02:13.590
 pour the cast bronze 

00:02:15.419 --> 00:02:20.379
 check that the sand mixture has set and after that remove the entrance 

00:02:21.269 --> 00:02:23.279
 separate the two covers 

00:02:23.279 --> 00:02:27.339
 each of which contains a section of the mold are removed 

00:02:27.339 --> 00:02:30.339
 models leaving empty in the mold cavity 

00:02:31.639 --> 00:02:34.209
 clean the walls of the mold 

00:02:34.209 --> 00:02:38.659
 This solution of graphite powder acts as a barrier that prevents 

00:02:38.659 --> 00:02:42.099
 the hot metal erosion of the epoxy that gives consistency to the mold 

00:02:44.339 --> 00:02:47.149
 then they apply a second layer 

00:02:47.149 --> 00:02:51.729
 the sand is so fine that without it the mold would reproduce even the marks 

00:02:51.729 --> 00:02:53.899
 of a brush 

00:02:53.899 --> 00:02:58.089
 look at the size of the match hole and that is the measurement a ceramic filter 

00:02:58.089 --> 00:03:02.919
 that will be stuck inside this filter will eliminate the antiparticle slag 

00:03:02.919 --> 00:03:06.119
 rust that forms when the metal comes in contact with the air 

00:03:07.559 --> 00:03:12.049
 Now they rejoin the two sections of the mold and hold it well so that the 

00:03:12.049 --> 00:03:15.049
 bronze did not leak during the casting 

00:03:17.509 --> 00:03:21.089
 confuse bronze ingots to build a full-sized bell 

00:03:21.089 --> 00:03:25.979
 It takes about two hours to give the oven a soft enough consistency 

00:03:25.979 --> 00:03:28.979
 you have to heat the metal to about 1,200 degrees 

00:03:31.119 --> 00:03:35.319
 for a quality casting the bronze pouring must be continuous without 

00:03:35.319 --> 00:03:37.969
 interruptions 

00:03:37.969 --> 00:03:42.269
 the overturning in the sand around the central channel prevents the metal from overflowing 

00:03:43.379 --> 00:03:47.859
 bronze takes half an hour to solidify and about 24 to cool 

00:03:49.319 --> 00:03:53.289
 the operators remove the sand mold with a pneumatic hammer with a lot 

00:03:53.289 --> 00:03:55.679
 Be careful not to damage the bells 

00:03:55.679 --> 00:03:58.729
 the campaign is covered by a residue of burned epoxy 

00:03:59.569 --> 00:04:02.649
 they remove it with a wire brush 

00:04:02.649 --> 00:04:07.419
 then they open the cup giving a blunt blow with a mallet 

00:04:11.159 --> 00:04:14.189
 they do not mark the exact central point of the campaign 

00:04:15.559 --> 00:04:18.559
 the piece will be installed from which to hang these 

00:04:19.139 --> 00:04:22.830
 first they make a small hole and they are enlarging it little by little 

00:04:23.379 --> 00:04:27.339
 the bronze is drilled gradually because the heat induced by friction 

00:04:27.339 --> 00:04:29.749
 crack the bell 

00:04:29.749 --> 00:04:34.110
 place the bell on the side to hang the badajoz the bronze hammer 

00:04:34.109 --> 00:04:37.109
 what's inside 

00:04:37.669 --> 00:04:41.940
 Each bell produced in this factory is subjected to six passes of 

00:04:41.939 --> 00:04:46.770
 Polishing starts with a stronger abrasive belt and ends with a wheel 

00:04:46.770 --> 00:04:49.610
 soft cloth polito 

00:04:49.610 --> 00:04:51.249
 after two hours of polishing 

00:04:51.249 --> 00:04:54.269
 the appearance of the bell is as beautiful as its sound 

00:04:55.539 --> 00:04:57.629
 the bell is already ready 'to shut up
