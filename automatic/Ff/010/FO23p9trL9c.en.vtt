00:04:17.000 --> 00:04:18.430 
think I'm gonna go with the heroin first
though<00:04:17.299> because<00:04:17.450> I<00:04:17.599> don't<00:04:17.750> want<00:04:17.900> to<00:04:17.989> pay<00:04:18.140> 30

00:04:18.430 --> 00:04:18.440 
though because I don't want to pay 30

00:04:18.440 --> 00:04:20.170 
though because I don't want to pay 30
bucks<00:04:18.530> for<00:04:19.039> a<00:04:19.070> month's<00:04:19.370> worth<00:04:19.549> of<00:04:19.729> shampoo

00:04:20.170 --> 00:04:20.180 
bucks for a month's worth of shampoo

00:04:20.180 --> 00:04:20.870 
bucks for a month's worth of shampoo
this

00:04:20.870 --> 00:04:20.880 
this

00:04:20.880 --> 00:04:25.040 
this
too<00:04:21.120> much<00:04:21.360> when<00:04:22.320> you<00:04:23.010> know<00:04:23.330> you<00:04:24.330> pay<00:04:24.570> for<00:04:24.870> about

00:04:25.040 --> 00:04:25.050 
too much when you know you pay for about

00:04:25.050 --> 00:04:27.950 
too much when you know you pay for about
six<00:04:25.500> months<00:04:25.740> of<00:04:26.040> shampoo<00:04:26.490> right<00:04:26.760> here<00:04:27.090> and

00:04:27.950 --> 00:04:27.960 
six months of shampoo right here and

00:04:27.960 --> 00:04:32.420 
six months of shampoo right here and
it's<00:04:28.560> like<00:04:28.710> five<00:04:29.040> dollars<00:04:29.780> so<00:04:30.780> I<00:04:31.620> think<00:04:32.010> the

00:04:32.420 --> 00:04:32.430 
it's like five dollars so I think the

00:04:32.430 --> 00:04:36.830 
it's like five dollars so I think the
the<00:04:32.810> hair<00:04:33.810> one<00:04:34.110> is<00:04:34.350> about<00:04:34.680> ten<00:04:35.400> bucks<00:04:35.670> so<00:04:36.540> if

00:04:36.830 --> 00:04:36.840 
the hair one is about ten bucks so if

00:04:36.840 --> 00:04:40.570 
the hair one is about ten bucks so if
that<00:04:36.990> lives<00:04:37.290> me<00:04:37.650> about<00:04:37.920> as<00:04:38.310> long<00:04:38.490> as<00:04:38.700> this<00:04:39.110> then

00:04:40.570 --> 00:04:40.580 
that lives me about as long as this then

00:04:40.580 --> 00:04:43.880 
that lives me about as long as this then
it<00:04:41.580> probably<00:04:41.970> won't<00:04:42.150> this<00:04:42.390> is<00:04:42.570> 25<00:04:43.110> ounces<00:04:43.560> the

00:04:43.880 --> 00:04:43.890 
it probably won't this is 25 ounces the

00:04:43.890 --> 00:04:46.490 
it probably won't this is 25 ounces the
hair<00:04:44.070> one<00:04:44.250> being<00:04:45.210> it's<00:04:45.330> in<00:04:45.480> 12<00:04:45.780> ounces<00:04:45.930> so

00:04:46.490 --> 00:04:46.500 
hair one being it's in 12 ounces so

00:04:46.500 --> 00:04:48.260 
hair one being it's in 12 ounces so
probably<00:04:47.040> last<00:04:47.280> me<00:04:47.430> about<00:04:47.610> three<00:04:48.090> months

00:04:48.260 --> 00:04:48.270 
probably last me about three months

00:04:48.270 --> 00:04:52.340 
probably last me about three months
hopefully<00:04:50.570> apparently<00:04:51.570> you<00:04:51.810> don't<00:04:51.960> have<00:04:52.200> to
