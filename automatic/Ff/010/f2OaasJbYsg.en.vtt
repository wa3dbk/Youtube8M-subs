00:00:09.900 --> 00:00:17.190
 hello youtube friends 

00:00:12.390 --> 00:00:20.060
 today the disaster how to put games to the 

00:00:17.190 --> 00:00:23.210
 usb memory for play 2 

00:00:20.060 --> 00:00:26.330
 Well the program that I use is the 

00:00:23.210 --> 00:00:29.570
 light looks useful by most is almost 

00:00:26.330 --> 00:00:33.129
 always the default program that 

00:00:29.570 --> 00:00:35.460
 more they use for this kind of thing 

00:00:33.129 --> 00:00:38.489
 here as you see 

00:00:35.460 --> 00:00:39.720
 I have the project 02 is a game of 

00:00:38.489 --> 00:00:43.500
 terror 

00:00:39.720 --> 00:00:44.750
 for as every name is called fatal 

00:00:43.500 --> 00:00:46.870
 frame 

00:00:44.750 --> 00:00:49.900
 good 

00:00:46.870 --> 00:00:54.980
 I can get another I try 

00:00:49.900 --> 00:00:59.140
 for that we will need sakhir us fire 

00:00:54.980 --> 00:00:59.140
 create game for and ready 

00:00:59.190 --> 00:01:05.570
 here we will select the disk where 

00:01:01.379 --> 00:01:05.570
 we have saved the choir 

00:01:05.860 --> 00:01:08.580
 I'm going to put it 

00:01:09.570 --> 00:01:12.350
 I was wrong 

00:01:12.490 --> 00:01:16.320
 I'm going to put a flower to street coal 

00:01:16.659 --> 00:01:21.850
 here are some games that have the 

00:01:19.840 --> 00:01:26.880
 very long name 

00:01:21.850 --> 00:01:26.880
 by default, nothing else should bring 3 

00:01:28.760 --> 00:01:35.740
 at least 10 letters 

00:01:32.299 --> 00:01:38.420
 for me nothing I'm going to get 

00:01:35.740 --> 00:01:40.200
 s 

00:01:38.420 --> 00:01:44.090
 good 

00:01:40.200 --> 00:01:44.090
 once we have chosen the hedgehog 

00:01:47.800 --> 00:01:50.800
 h 

00:01:52.900 --> 00:01:56.220
 and what we are going to create 

00:01:56.980 --> 00:02:02.430
 and the story that you are creating 

00:01:59.880 --> 00:02:05.600
 to watch the video so it's not done 

00:02:02.430 --> 00:02:05.600
 very long 

00:02:06.180 --> 00:02:12.390
 and ready once we complete we give you the 

00:02:10.200 --> 00:02:14.819
 close button 

00:02:12.390 --> 00:02:17.060
 and automatically here the 

00:02:14.819 --> 00:02:17.060
 iso 

00:02:17.610 --> 00:02:23.550
 Here is the space and the name 

00:02:20.880 --> 00:02:27.470
 the file number 

00:02:23.550 --> 00:02:30.400
 the region code 

00:02:27.470 --> 00:02:33.269
 ready has not been done 

00:02:30.400 --> 00:02:33.269
 we give you to save 

00:02:33.360 --> 00:02:40.880
 and no program that serves to 

00:02:37.590 --> 00:02:44.690
 fragment the memories 

00:02:40.880 --> 00:02:47.760
 that is the next step so that you do not 

00:02:44.690 --> 00:02:51.019
 leave an error 

00:02:47.760 --> 00:02:51.019
 mÃ©ndez loader 

00:02:51.470 --> 00:02:56.680
 this we indicate 

00:02:54.210 --> 00:02:58.830
 let's see next 

00:02:56.680 --> 00:03:01.050
 we improve then 

00:02:58.830 --> 00:03:05.090
 next 

00:03:01.050 --> 00:03:05.090
 was going to be the memory 

00:03:06.150 --> 00:03:12.060
 an advice I recommend you to put 

00:03:09.709 --> 00:03:13.900
 all the games that you go to 

00:03:12.060 --> 00:03:17.900
 to put 

00:03:13.900 --> 00:03:21.500
 one by one is very dangerous 

00:03:17.900 --> 00:03:27.080
 to the four or five games that you 

00:03:21.500 --> 00:03:30.610
 want now if we give in elementary 

00:03:27.080 --> 00:03:30.610
 if we press of really 

00:03:31.800 --> 00:03:39.490
 while the translator 

00:03:34.800 --> 00:03:43.390
 like nothing else I have two eggs is a 

00:03:39.490 --> 00:03:49.260
 little faster is actually 45 

00:03:43.390 --> 00:03:49.260
 with 6 games and it's later 

00:03:50.400 --> 00:04:01.200
 to collaborate with that again 

00:03:55.240 --> 00:04:01.200
 h to fragment and ready 

00:04:01.450 --> 00:04:04.530
 and here we go what 

00:04:07.500 --> 00:04:10.500
 two 

00:04:12.300 --> 00:04:17.070
 the error d 

00:04:14.819 --> 00:04:20.889
 this game has been fragmented somewhat 

00:04:17.070 --> 00:04:23.469
 so this program is not going to come out 

00:04:20.889 --> 00:04:27.990
 and good friends that's all any 

00:04:23.469 --> 00:04:30.650
 I doubt they have leave in the comments 

00:04:27.990 --> 00:04:30.650
 you go
