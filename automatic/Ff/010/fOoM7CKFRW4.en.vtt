00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.319
 Hello everyone and welcome 

00:00:02.220 --> 00:00:06.720
 finally in this new video from 

00:00:04.319 --> 00:00:10.980
 a few minutes apple has officially 

00:00:06.720 --> 00:00:13.049
 released to the public ios 8.0 is in 

00:00:10.980 --> 00:00:15.900
 this video we will see how to update a 

00:00:13.049 --> 00:00:20.359
 device to this new ios version 

00:00:15.900 --> 00:00:20.359
 let's not waste time and start right away 

00:00:21.870 --> 00:00:26.740
 well before starting I want to 

00:00:24.630 --> 00:00:30.130
 specify that this procedure is 

00:00:26.740 --> 00:00:35.200
 compatible with iphone 6 iphone 6 plus 

00:00:30.130 --> 00:00:39.580
 iphone 5 and iphone 5 c iphone 5 iphone 4s 

00:00:35.200 --> 00:00:44.590
 ipad and ipad mini retina ipad mini 1 

00:00:39.580 --> 00:00:46.780
 ipad 4 ipad 3 ipad 2 and ipod touch by 

00:00:44.590 --> 00:00:48.760
 fifth generation in my case precisely 

00:00:46.780 --> 00:00:51.220
 I will show you this guide on my ipod 

00:00:48.760 --> 00:00:53.199
 fifth generation touch if you have a 

00:00:51.220 --> 00:00:54.070
 device that was not mentioned in 

00:00:53.199 --> 00:00:56.739
 this list 

00:00:54.070 --> 00:00:58.239
 I'm sorry but you can't install us 

00:00:56.739 --> 00:01:00.850
 ajo s8 

00:00:58.239 --> 00:01:03.910
 having said that another premise is the method 

00:01:00.850 --> 00:01:06.580
 which i will show you to install ios 8 is 

00:01:03.910 --> 00:01:08.500
 the so-called update from itunes 

00:01:06.580 --> 00:01:09.729
 this means what means al 

00:01:08.500 --> 00:01:12.070
 place to do the update 

00:01:09.729 --> 00:01:13.300
 then directly from the device 

00:01:12.070 --> 00:01:15.040
 by going to general settings 

00:01:13.300 --> 00:01:17.020
 software update 

00:01:15.040 --> 00:01:19.840
 we will do it via the computer i like 

00:01:17.020 --> 00:01:21.520
 you see currently are on ios 7.1.2 e 

00:01:19.840 --> 00:01:24.640
 at the end of this video I will find myself 

00:01:21.520 --> 00:01:27.310
 ios 8 successfully installed the first 

00:01:24.640 --> 00:01:30.610
 key thing to do is go into the 

00:01:27.310 --> 00:01:33.490
 icloud settings section scroll 

00:01:30.610 --> 00:01:35.470
 down and turn off find the 

00:01:33.490 --> 00:01:37.150
 my ipod touch or find mine 

00:01:35.470 --> 00:01:38.979
 iphone or find my ipad a 

00:01:37.150 --> 00:01:41.439
 depending on the device it is on 

00:01:38.979 --> 00:01:43.150
 installing to the s8 then insert the 

00:01:41.439 --> 00:01:45.970
 password of your apple id e 

00:01:43.150 --> 00:01:47.020
 confirmed to deactivate find mine 

00:01:45.970 --> 00:01:48.880
 device 

00:01:47.020 --> 00:01:51.130
 one last premise before starting 

00:01:48.880 --> 00:01:54.580
 I want to specify that this 

00:01:51.130 --> 00:01:56.799
 procedure will not delete any data 

00:01:54.580 --> 00:01:59.140
 then music applications data of 

00:01:56.799 --> 00:02:01.420
 games etc. from your device 

00:01:59.140 --> 00:02:02.979
 after updating from the computer 

00:02:01.420 --> 00:02:04.689
 everything will remain as it was before 

00:02:02.979 --> 00:02:07.659
 because this method is therefore more 

00:02:04.689 --> 00:02:09.220
 advantageous compared to the classic 

00:02:07.659 --> 00:02:10.660
 general update settings 

00:02:09.220 --> 00:02:13.959
 software since doing it from 

00:02:10.660 --> 00:02:15.790
 computer we won't have any small ones 

00:02:13.959 --> 00:02:17.829
 slowdowns or imperfections that 

00:02:15.790 --> 00:02:19.299
 could go to create through a 

00:02:17.829 --> 00:02:21.250
 update from the device 

00:02:19.299 --> 00:02:23.430
 having said that we connect ours 

00:02:21.250 --> 00:02:26.769
 device to the computer using the cable 

00:02:23.430 --> 00:02:28.000
 lightning usb later we open 

00:02:26.769 --> 00:02:30.250
 itunes 

00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:32.560
 I recommend it is essential to make sure 

00:02:30.250 --> 00:02:35.950
 that they are in possession of the last one 

00:02:32.560 --> 00:02:37.890
 of itunes in this case from 11.4 lo 

00:02:35.950 --> 00:02:40.330
 you can check by going up to 

00:02:37.890 --> 00:02:43.060
 info on itunes if you have a mac 

00:02:40.330 --> 00:02:45.370
 or if you have a windows 

00:02:43.060 --> 00:02:47.770
 just open the apple application 

00:02:45.370 --> 00:02:48.849
 software update by searching for it directly 

00:02:47.770 --> 00:02:50.950
 from the start menu 

00:02:48.849 --> 00:02:53.769
 if you want to be on the safe side, it will be enough 

00:02:50.950 --> 00:02:55.900
 go to the apple.com website to go to the top 

00:02:53.769 --> 00:02:57.489
 on itunes and then press on 

00:02:55.900 --> 00:02:58.920
 itunes download 

00:02:57.489 --> 00:03:02.019
 then press on this button 

00:02:58.920 --> 00:03:04.090
 blue download and we will download the last one 

00:03:02.019 --> 00:03:05.290
 version of itunes for our system 

00:03:04.090 --> 00:03:07.720
 operating 

00:03:05.290 --> 00:03:12.640
 later we will also need the file 

00:03:07.720 --> 00:03:14.470
 ipsw yos 8.0 also for these I will leave 

00:03:12.640 --> 00:03:16.900
 linking description don't worry 

00:03:14.470 --> 00:03:19.150
 to download them I want to do one 

00:03:16.900 --> 00:03:21.190
 premise for some devices as per 

00:03:19.150 --> 00:03:23.410
 example for the iphone 

00:03:21.190 --> 00:03:25.180
 there are various sub-models for example 

00:03:23.410 --> 00:03:29.380
 for the iPhone 5 s 

00:03:25.180 --> 00:03:30.160
 there is the iphone 5 s gsm and the iphone 5 s 

00:03:29.380 --> 00:03:32.440
 cdma 

00:03:30.160 --> 00:03:34.120
 the same applies to the iPhone 5 etc. 

00:03:32.440 --> 00:03:34.930
 therefore in description for example for 

00:03:34.120 --> 00:03:37.390
 the iPhone 5 

00:03:34.930 --> 00:03:39.850
 I'll let you close a link because you have to 

00:03:37.390 --> 00:03:42.340
 download them psv for the correct below 

00:03:39.850 --> 00:03:43.870
 model if you don't know how to orient yourself 

00:03:42.340 --> 00:03:46.959
 don't worry just download 

00:03:43.870 --> 00:03:48.670
 an application called forecast is 

00:03:46.959 --> 00:03:50.530
 available for both mac and windows 

00:03:48.670 --> 00:03:52.450
 I leave the link in description and in 

00:03:50.530 --> 00:03:55.959
 this way as you see here it says 

00:03:52.450 --> 00:03:58.359
 model in my case ipod 5.1 so you 

00:03:55.959 --> 00:04:00.459
 write down this writing because I am in 

00:03:58.359 --> 00:04:03.040
 description I will write just that 

00:04:00.459 --> 00:04:05.620
 written then just download them psv 

00:04:03.040 --> 00:04:07.690
 for the correct model of yours 

00:04:05.620 --> 00:04:09.370
 iphone ipod touch or ipad 

00:04:07.690 --> 00:04:12.310
 did this once he found them 

00:04:09.370 --> 00:04:14.620
 psv this file correctly we return 

00:04:12.310 --> 00:04:16.750
 on itunes and we're going to click on 

00:04:14.620 --> 00:04:17.590
 our device which will be shown in 

00:04:16.750 --> 00:04:19.150
 top right 

00:04:17.590 --> 00:04:21.010
 did this and as you see we find ourselves 

00:04:19.150 --> 00:04:23.110
 in the summary sheet of the device 

00:04:21.010 --> 00:04:25.810
 and if we are on mac 

00:04:23.110 --> 00:04:28.479
 we hold the alt key of the 

00:04:25.810 --> 00:04:31.060
 keyboard while on windows 

00:04:28.479 --> 00:04:31.720
 keep the shift key pressed 

00:04:31.060 --> 00:04:34.320
 keyboard 

00:04:31.720 --> 00:04:37.000
 and while we hold these keys 

00:04:34.320 --> 00:04:37.990
 click on the verification button 

00:04:37.000 --> 00:04:40.330
 updates 

00:04:37.990 --> 00:04:43.120
 having done this it will open this short 

00:04:40.330 --> 00:04:46.090
 file selection window and let's go to 

00:04:43.120 --> 00:04:48.760
 select the kato in ipsw file 

00:04:46.090 --> 00:04:51.099
 then we press then on update e 

00:04:48.760 --> 00:04:53.320
 we await the process of 

00:04:51.099 --> 00:04:55.870
 update coming to an end then in 

00:04:53.320 --> 00:04:58.479
 this moment itunes is sending to 

00:04:55.870 --> 00:05:01.030
 device update data on 

00:04:58.479 --> 00:05:03.220
 whole process will last about 10 minutes 

00:05:01.030 --> 00:05:05.349
 obviously or speeded up the video for 

00:05:03.220 --> 00:05:07.090
 don't waste your time so we'll do it 

00:05:05.349 --> 00:05:09.340
 simply let's see how 

00:05:07.090 --> 00:05:12.190
 see during the update phase 

00:05:09.340 --> 00:05:14.680
 our device will show this 

00:05:12.190 --> 00:05:17.320
 apple logo with a bar 

00:05:14.680 --> 00:05:20.430
 loading up and then wait 

00:05:17.320 --> 00:05:20.430
 that fills up 

00:05:40.109 --> 00:05:44.739
 perfect once finished it will appear a 

00:05:42.309 --> 00:05:46.239
 this message from itunes that alerts us 

00:05:44.739 --> 00:05:48.909
 that update was successful 

00:05:46.239 --> 00:05:51.279
 our ipod iphone or ipad you are 

00:05:48.909 --> 00:05:53.139
 restarting, a second bar will appear 

00:05:51.279 --> 00:05:55.239
 loading but it will be much more 

00:05:53.139 --> 00:05:56.819
 fast to disappear of the first is one 

00:05:55.239 --> 00:05:59.079
 once disappeared we will add 

00:05:56.819 --> 00:06:01.689
 directly to this white screen 

00:05:59.079 --> 00:06:04.179
 of configuration then we unlock the 

00:06:01.689 --> 00:06:06.669
 device update completed then 

00:06:04.179 --> 00:06:08.769
 we configure it as we think best 

00:06:06.669 --> 00:06:09.909
 the important thing now is to log in with the 

00:06:08.769 --> 00:06:12.189
 our apple id 

00:06:09.909 --> 00:06:14.199
 we are waiting for icloud to activate if 

00:06:12.189 --> 00:06:17.049
 you want to use find my device 

00:06:14.199 --> 00:06:18.759
 now I have to set the emails for 

00:06:17.049 --> 00:06:21.369
 imessage and facetime and we press 

00:06:18.759 --> 00:06:23.439
 next for now I don't add a 

00:06:21.369 --> 00:06:26.319
 block with code I will do it later for not 

00:06:23.439 --> 00:06:28.209
 make you waste time starts and here you go 

00:06:26.319 --> 00:06:31.329
 the white screen closes and we will be 

00:06:28.209 --> 00:06:33.009
 on ios 8 installed as you see I do not have 

00:06:31.329 --> 00:06:34.779
 lost the apps I had before 

00:06:33.009 --> 00:06:36.639
 everything is exactly as before 

00:06:34.779 --> 00:06:40.839
 the only thing that has changed is the 

00:06:36.639 --> 00:06:42.309
 mobile operating system ie ios 8.0 

00:06:40.839 --> 00:06:45.099
 so we can say that the update 

00:06:42.309 --> 00:06:47.259
 it went well and we succeeded 

00:06:45.099 --> 00:06:49.959
 successfully installing ios and 8 

00:06:47.259 --> 00:06:51.699
