00:00:00.689 --> 00:00:02.240
 I think 

00:00:02.240 --> 00:00:05.160
 Zack Zack Zack 

00:00:05.160 --> 00:00:09.070
 the foreign ministry that wants us to be working on the project 

00:00:12.349 --> 00:00:14.739
 Michels first 

00:00:14.739 --> 00:00:18.249
 Jascha search mode Sweden Lassi abundance and 8 

00:00:18.249 --> 00:00:20.359
 for the first time closes this gap 

00:00:20.359 --> 00:00:23.050
 with in parts 

00:00:23.050 --> 00:00:25.210
 Aha butcher Rösler us 

00:00:25.210 --> 00:00:28.730
 but not expected and so began Monster but I think we have enough 

00:00:28.730 --> 00:00:30.999
 illuminated 

00:00:30.999 --> 00:00:33.010
 I was 

00:00:33.010 --> 00:00:34.820
 so modern 

00:00:34.820 --> 00:00:37.910
 is it still as close 0 0 

00:00:37.910 --> 00:00:39.100
 Window below 

00:00:39.100 --> 00:00:41.970
 if the accident does not exist 

00:00:41.970 --> 00:00:43.010
 continue 

00:00:43.010 --> 00:00:46.200
 a here the relationship sword in the hand 

00:00:46.200 --> 00:00:49.200
 and then it starts 

00:00:52.120 --> 00:00:55.120
 It is a 

00:00:58.500 --> 00:01:01.500
 Chico 

00:01:06.740 --> 00:01:08.440
 s 

00:01:08.440 --> 00:01:11.440
 No and I too Paris St 

00:01:13.300 --> 00:01:15.850
 in the event that in quick succession 

00:01:15.850 --> 00:01:19.090
 then better said to Cola Cola 

00:01:19.090 --> 00:01:20.930
 hope that one 

00:01:20.930 --> 00:01:22.830
 almost unlimited 

00:01:22.830 --> 00:01:25.870
 Unfortunately, I do not hate the problem because of its seven pages 

00:01:27.180 --> 00:01:30.450
 Owen lying down 

00:01:30.450 --> 00:01:32.290
 Binder is close 

00:01:32.290 --> 00:01:35.290
 but as I said I do not want that 

00:01:38.060 --> 00:01:39.440
 07 

00:01:39.440 --> 00:01:41.720
 a read but won over it 

00:01:41.720 --> 00:01:44.720
 come to give to the invisible beings I am so wise 

00:01:46.620 --> 00:01:49.160
 both became heavy and so on 

00:01:49.160 --> 00:01:51.930
 sec 

00:01:51.930 --> 00:01:55.430
 with light is he much better to dismantle the quiz 

00:01:58.020 --> 00:01:59.910
 So Rolf already 

00:01:59.910 --> 00:02:02.049
 unhealthy reminders above 

00:02:02.049 --> 00:02:03.630
 Markus Babbel 

00:02:03.630 --> 00:02:06.770
 the FOMC's comeback 

00:02:06.770 --> 00:02:08.409
 Day 

00:02:08.409 --> 00:02:09.670
 would have 

00:02:09.670 --> 00:02:12.749
 Sag Harbor is to her influence 

00:02:12.749 --> 00:02:15.749
 I say only reserved 

00:02:16.469 --> 00:02:18.189
 over the Roth 

00:02:18.189 --> 00:02:19.050
 Cairo 

00:02:19.050 --> 00:02:21.949
 Although there is a lessening first form found 

00:02:21.949 --> 00:02:24.949
 That is 

00:02:25.479 --> 00:02:28.739
 Do you know that you are always short if it is out 

00:02:28.739 --> 00:02:30.989
 this is clear 

00:02:30.989 --> 00:02:33.989
 dab + lustful negotiation 

00:02:35.849 --> 00:02:40.489
 KNA what do I say astronauts dirty there is always something very voluntary for 

00:02:40.489 --> 00:02:41.930
 the print 

00:02:41.930 --> 00:02:42.749
 from 

00:02:42.749 --> 00:02:46.469
 that could be very low very important 

00:02:47.089 --> 00:02:51.749
 These relics Stone he wants 24 all these and 

00:02:52.359 --> 00:02:55.149
 Schiphol was and force 

00:02:55.149 --> 00:02:58.149
 was mandatory 

00:02:59.219 --> 00:03:01.839
 Gerke that is the question now 

00:03:01.839 --> 00:03:04.099
 we are so beautiful here now 

00:03:04.099 --> 00:03:06.269
 also broke out next to Aniston 

00:03:06.269 --> 00:03:09.269
 and Frank Oltmanns found 

00:03:10.159 --> 00:03:14.559
 The stroll and Ashley Cole Abbesbüttel to charcoal his customers until 7 Plattling 

00:03:15.149 --> 00:03:18.359
 and that no student is welcome, of course, too 

00:03:18.359 --> 00:03:21.180
 and then I'll be back soon 

00:03:21.180 --> 00:03:23.199
 to the daylight 

00:03:23.199 --> 00:03:26.930
 and then Sweden and his aldermen too I want to pose a bit 

00:03:26.929 --> 00:03:29.649
 what we do there and monsters 

00:03:29.649 --> 00:03:34.889
 but next to Stoner raised self-defense could appear at the 14 seconds we know 

00:03:34.889 --> 00:03:36.669
 I get the grades I'm off 

00:03:36.669 --> 00:03:39.729
 on the beach of Borkum up to prices from Chapeau 

00:03:39.729 --> 00:03:41.089
 Yes 

00:03:41.089 --> 00:03:43.779
 at these 

00:03:43.779 --> 00:03:47.029
 district 

00:03:47.029 --> 00:03:48.089
 pow 

00:03:48.089 --> 00:03:50.209
 pow 

00:03:50.209 --> 00:03:53.709
 conclusive Coles always that there are and real crowds in new buildings and 

00:03:53.709 --> 00:03:55.459
 Waiver of a raise 

00:03:55.459 --> 00:03:57.949
 at Eisen Siemens at 1 

00:03:57.949 --> 00:04:00.949
 Gulli's at least a hundred partners 

00:04:01.599 --> 00:04:04.089
 So not so bad digging Kolb 

00:04:04.089 --> 00:04:07.599
 and therefore I would say 6 perfect 

00:04:10.189 --> 00:04:13.439
 and I think when I'm in the house I will pause the recording first 

00:04:14.289 --> 00:04:17.289
 and here should then say what they rate 

00:04:18.199 --> 00:04:21.199
 ultimately want to see what's going on why 

00:04:22.180 --> 00:04:24.029
 Broder 

00:04:24.029 --> 00:04:28.299
 what you expect from me is that it is enough but no forecasting dare though 

00:04:28.299 --> 00:04:30.259
 I want to calm down to cuts 

00:04:30.259 --> 00:04:33.349
 Ricci do it all alone without your opinion that's boring too 

00:04:35.680 --> 00:04:38.979
 therefore what early nineties made Pocher 

00:04:38.979 --> 00:04:41.979
 if you already have fire Mr. Scholz 

00:04:42.889 --> 00:04:45.889
 That's why I am now 

00:04:48.770 --> 00:04:51.460
 Update did not know that gave her a dangerous protect 

00:04:51.460 --> 00:04:53.949
 can 

00:04:53.949 --> 00:04:56.949
 therefore, Estonia may have been born 

00:04:59.439 --> 00:05:03.709
 However, hope not hope that Artur Schmidt can quickly in our house 

00:05:06.749 --> 00:05:09.969
 8 Stuttgart 

00:05:09.969 --> 00:05:12.969
 There were staff shortages below 

00:05:16.110 --> 00:05:19.420
 I see no quick progress as I said 

00:05:19.419 --> 00:05:21.589
 do wash washing 

00:05:21.589 --> 00:05:24.589
 or just run fast 

00:05:28.379 --> 00:05:31.379
 there it could be no one mostly high 

00:05:32.569 --> 00:05:35.499
 but not so 

00:05:35.499 --> 00:05:38.939
 also includes 

00:05:38.939 --> 00:05:40.509
 Year calls 

00:05:40.509 --> 00:05:42.949
 What do you want to do 

00:05:42.949 --> 00:05:44.770
 No 

00:05:44.770 --> 00:05:46.059
 it is summer 

00:05:46.059 --> 00:05:48.039
 but with the ambience are 

00:05:48.039 --> 00:05:50.810
 I believe them in the OTZ because they shine 

00:05:50.810 --> 00:05:54.289
 Rolf Beiter received 

00:05:54.289 --> 00:05:57.369
 Publisher technical led Kohl also 

00:05:57.369 --> 00:06:02.179
 just like here 8 pieces close 64 but the decline is all stupid 

00:06:02.179 --> 00:06:06.839
 seven of them by the way Scholz 7 percent 

00:06:07.849 --> 00:06:10.849
 but the glass and the puck into the gate 

00:06:15.469 --> 00:06:16.809
 can win 

00:06:16.809 --> 00:06:19.749
 enjoy a short view 

00:06:19.749 --> 00:06:22.020
 beautiful place 

00:06:22.020 --> 00:06:22.880
 on 

00:06:22.880 --> 00:06:26.020
 Diana quit quickly and we have to say something 

00:06:26.020 --> 00:06:27.439
 Jürgen Nau 

00:06:27.439 --> 00:06:30.529
 in the next episode 4 million 

00:06:30.529 --> 00:06:31.279
 according to Prof
