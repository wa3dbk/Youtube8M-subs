so<00:00:02.639> these<00:00:02.760> are<00:00:02.939> variety<00:00:03.510> missions<00:00:04.400> for

00:00:05.390 --> 00:00:05.400 
so these are variety missions for

00:00:05.400 --> 00:00:08.390 
so these are variety missions for
variety<00:00:05.700> missions<00:00:06.240> each<00:00:07.230> level<00:00:07.859> usually<00:00:08.069> has

00:00:08.390 --> 00:00:08.400 
variety missions each level usually has

00:00:08.400 --> 00:00:10.280 
variety missions each level usually has
some<00:00:08.639> type<00:00:08.820> of<00:00:08.849> unique<00:00:09.210> goal<00:00:09.480> they<00:00:10.080> don't

00:00:10.280 --> 00:00:10.290 
some type of unique goal they don't

00:00:10.290 --> 00:00:14.360 
some type of unique goal they don't
share<00:00:10.740> a<00:00:10.769> similar<00:00:11.130> goal<00:00:11.870> a<00:00:13.040> lot<00:00:14.040> of<00:00:14.130> them<00:00:14.280> are

00:00:14.360 --> 00:00:14.370 
share a similar goal a lot of them are

00:00:14.370 --> 00:00:18.590 
share a similar goal a lot of them are
just<00:00:14.780> you<00:00:15.780> know<00:00:15.980> navigating<00:00:17.240> some<00:00:18.240> type<00:00:18.480> of

00:00:18.590 --> 00:00:18.600 
just you know navigating some type of

00:00:18.600 --> 00:00:21.290 
just you know navigating some type of
obstacle<00:00:18.930> like<00:00:19.470> here<00:00:19.890> I<00:00:20.070> saw<00:00:20.789> this<00:00:20.970> in<00:00:21.240> the

00:00:21.290 --> 00:00:21.300 
obstacle like here I saw this in the

00:00:21.300 --> 00:00:24.019 
obstacle like here I saw this in the
first<00:00:21.630> video<00:00:21.869> with<00:00:22.529> snake<00:00:22.920> the<00:00:23.730> difference

00:00:24.019 --> 00:00:24.029 
first video with snake the difference

00:00:24.029 --> 00:00:25.609 
first video with snake the difference
here<00:00:24.269> is<00:00:24.300> that<00:00:24.420> because<00:00:24.660> of<00:00:24.840> ridings<00:00:25.320> roll

00:00:25.609 --> 00:00:25.619 
here is that because of ridings roll

00:00:25.619 --> 00:00:27.439 
here is that because of ridings roll
cartwheel<00:00:26.279> thing<00:00:26.730> he<00:00:26.910> can<00:00:27.090> take<00:00:27.269> you<00:00:27.420> a

00:00:27.439 --> 00:00:27.449 
cartwheel thing he can take you a

00:00:27.449 --> 00:00:29.990 
cartwheel thing he can take you a
different<00:00:27.960> route<00:00:28.140> and<00:00:28.439> snake<00:00:28.680> can<00:00:28.949> and<00:00:29.220> it's<00:00:29.910> a

00:00:29.990 --> 00:00:30.000 
different route and snake can and it's a

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:34.240 
different route and snake can and it's a
lot<00:00:30.179> faster<00:00:32.270> it's<00:00:33.270> also<00:00:33.420> easier<00:00:33.930> because

00:00:34.240 --> 00:00:34.250 
lot faster it's also easier because

00:00:34.250 --> 00:00:37.430 
lot faster it's also easier because
there<00:00:35.250> are<00:00:35.370> less<00:00:35.550> mines<00:00:35.880> and<00:00:36.390> their<00:00:37.140> patterns

00:00:37.430 --> 00:00:37.440 
there are less mines and their patterns

00:00:37.440 --> 00:00:39.979 
there are less mines and their patterns
for<00:00:37.920> movement<00:00:38.129> are<00:00:38.820> a<00:00:38.879> lot<00:00:39.090> easier<00:00:39.120> to<00:00:39.719> get

00:00:39.979 --> 00:00:39.989 
for movement are a lot easier to get

00:00:39.989 --> 00:00:56.160 
for movement are a lot easier to get
around

00:00:56.160 --> 00:00:56.170 

00:00:56.170 --> 00:00:58.960 

here's<00:00:57.170> one<00:00:57.410> that's<00:00:57.620> really<00:00:58.070> irritating<00:00:58.250> even

00:00:58.960 --> 00:00:58.970 
here's one that's really irritating even

00:00:58.970 --> 00:01:01.690 
here's one that's really irritating even
with<00:00:59.090> Ryan<00:00:59.390> who<00:00:59.830> most<00:01:00.830> of<00:01:00.950> his<00:01:01.100> missions<00:01:01.580> are

00:01:01.690 --> 00:01:01.700 
with Ryan who most of his missions are

00:01:01.700 --> 00:01:02.260 
with Ryan who most of his missions are
pretty<00:01:01.910> easy

00:01:02.260 --> 00:01:02.270 
pretty easy

00:01:02.270 --> 00:01:04.600 
pretty easy
you<00:01:02.810> got<00:01:02.990> a<00:01:03.020> all<00:01:03.770> you<00:01:03.950> gotta<00:01:04.130> do<00:01:04.309> is<00:01:04.340> just

00:01:04.600 --> 00:01:04.610 
you got a all you gotta do is just

00:01:04.610 --> 00:01:07.750 
you got a all you gotta do is just
navigate<00:01:05.180> this<00:01:05.930> hellish<00:01:06.500> place<00:01:06.800> by<00:01:07.220> dropping

00:01:07.750 --> 00:01:07.760 
navigate this hellish place by dropping

00:01:07.760 --> 00:01:10.210 
navigate this hellish place by dropping
down<00:01:07.940> and<00:01:08.240> when<00:01:09.200> you<00:01:09.230> get<00:01:09.410> next<00:01:09.770> to<00:01:09.920> the<00:01:10.040> neck

00:01:10.210 --> 00:01:10.220 
down and when you get next to the neck

00:01:10.220 --> 00:01:12.790 
down and when you get next to the neck
follow<00:01:10.970> to<00:01:11.210> the<00:01:11.330> next<00:01:11.570> girder<00:01:11.810> or<00:01:12.560> whatever

00:01:12.790 --> 00:01:12.800 
follow to the next girder or whatever

00:01:12.800 --> 00:01:15.430 
follow to the next girder or whatever
you<00:01:13.670> just<00:01:13.880> press<00:01:14.300> triangle<00:01:14.720> and<00:01:14.930> catch<00:01:15.080> it<00:01:15.110> but

00:01:15.430 --> 00:01:15.440 
you just press triangle and catch it but

00:01:15.440 --> 00:01:19.210 
you just press triangle and catch it but
the<00:01:15.500> window<00:01:16.160> for<00:01:16.460> catching<00:01:16.850> these<00:01:17.860> is<00:01:18.860> pretty

00:01:19.210 --> 00:01:19.220 
the window for catching these is pretty

00:01:19.220 --> 00:01:21.280 
the window for catching these is pretty
small<00:01:19.580> and<00:01:19.640> you<00:01:20.000> can't<00:01:20.300> mash<00:01:20.600> the<00:01:20.870> button<00:01:21.200> I

00:01:21.280 --> 00:01:21.290 
small and you can't mash the button I

00:01:21.290 --> 00:01:23.740 
small and you can't mash the button I
think<00:01:21.320> it<00:01:21.650> punishes<00:01:22.010> you<00:01:22.340> if<00:01:22.610> you<00:01:23.300> mash<00:01:23.510> the

00:01:23.740 --> 00:01:23.750 
think it punishes you if you mash the

00:01:23.750 --> 00:01:25.030 
think it punishes you if you mash the
button<00:01:24.050> too<00:01:24.170> much<00:01:24.380> at<00:01:24.619> least<00:01:24.740> that's<00:01:24.979> what

00:01:25.030 --> 00:01:25.040 
button too much at least that's what

00:01:25.040 --> 00:01:30.010 
button too much at least that's what
happens<00:01:25.340> when<00:01:25.490> I<00:01:25.520> play<00:01:25.970> this<00:01:26.210> level<00:01:29.020> this

00:01:30.010 --> 00:01:30.020 
happens when I play this level this

00:01:30.020 --> 00:01:33.490 
happens when I play this level this
level<00:01:30.350> is<00:01:30.470> also<00:01:30.619> in<00:01:31.250> snakes<00:01:32.150> variety<00:01:32.750> mission

00:01:33.490 --> 00:01:33.500 
level is also in snakes variety mission

00:01:33.500 --> 00:01:38.260 
level is also in snakes variety mission
set<00:01:33.860> but<00:01:34.670> it's<00:01:35.270> way<00:01:35.750> way<00:01:36.560> worse<00:01:37.010> than<00:01:38.000> this<00:01:38.210> one

00:01:38.260 --> 00:01:38.270 
set but it's way way worse than this one

00:01:38.270 --> 00:02:02.230 
set but it's way way worse than this one
you'll<00:01:38.720> see<00:01:38.990> in<00:01:39.229> a<00:01:39.320> second<00:01:39.740> what<00:01:39.860> I<00:01:39.890> mean

00:02:02.230 --> 00:02:02.240 

00:02:02.240 --> 00:02:05.380 

oh<00:02:03.189> and<00:02:04.189> you<00:02:04.250> take<00:02:04.430> fall<00:02:04.700> damage<00:02:04.729> here<00:02:05.240> unless

00:02:05.380 --> 00:02:05.390 
oh and you take fall damage here unless

00:02:05.390 --> 00:02:07.270 
oh and you take fall damage here unless
you<00:02:05.600> catch<00:02:05.810> that<00:02:06.110> girder<00:02:06.710> right<00:02:06.890> there<00:02:07.100> which

00:02:07.270 --> 00:02:07.280 
you catch that girder right there which

00:02:07.280 --> 00:02:09.580 
you catch that girder right there which
is<00:02:07.399> kind<00:02:07.520> of<00:02:07.640> dumb<00:02:07.909> but<00:02:08.179> doesn't<00:02:08.929> penalize<00:02:09.259> you

00:02:09.580 --> 00:02:09.590 
is kind of dumb but doesn't penalize you

00:02:09.590 --> 00:02:21.940 
is kind of dumb but doesn't penalize you
at<00:02:09.679> all<00:02:09.830> score<00:02:10.280> wise<00:02:10.520> at<00:02:10.759> least<00:02:19.720> now<00:02:20.950> with

00:02:21.940 --> 00:02:21.950 
at all score wise at least now with

00:02:21.950 --> 00:02:26.170 
at all score wise at least now with
snake<00:02:23.410> this<00:02:24.410> level<00:02:24.890> like<00:02:25.340> triples<00:02:25.910> and

00:02:26.170 --> 00:02:26.180 
snake this level like triples and

00:02:26.180 --> 00:02:28.150 
snake this level like triples and
difficulty<00:02:26.810> it<00:02:27.500> sucks

00:02:28.150 --> 00:02:28.160 
difficulty it sucks

00:02:28.160 --> 00:02:30.009 
difficulty it sucks
at<00:02:28.310> first<00:02:28.550> you<00:02:28.940> know<00:02:29.030> it's<00:02:29.180> the<00:02:29.239> same<00:02:29.510> the<00:02:29.780> the

00:02:30.009 --> 00:02:30.019 
at first you know it's the same the the

00:02:30.019 --> 00:02:31.390 
at first you know it's the same the the
holes<00:02:30.260> and<00:02:30.530> everything<00:02:30.620> you<00:02:30.950> got<00:02:31.099> a<00:02:31.130> catch

00:02:31.390 --> 00:02:31.400 
holes and everything you got a catch

00:02:31.400 --> 00:02:34.270 
holes and everything you got a catch
turn<00:02:31.700> the<00:02:31.849> same<00:02:32.090> place<00:02:32.590> it's<00:02:33.590> just<00:02:33.830> that<00:02:34.040> they

00:02:34.270 --> 00:02:34.280 
turn the same place it's just that they

00:02:34.280 --> 00:02:36.759 
turn the same place it's just that they
put<00:02:34.549> mines<00:02:34.819> here<00:02:35.209> now<00:02:35.420> and<00:02:36.260> the<00:02:36.380> problem<00:02:36.680> with

00:02:36.759 --> 00:02:36.769 
put mines here now and the problem with

00:02:36.769 --> 00:02:40.449 
put mines here now and the problem with
this<00:02:36.890> level<00:02:37.220> is<00:02:37.340> that<00:02:38.200> it's<00:02:39.200> really<00:02:39.769> hard<00:02:40.069> to

00:02:40.449 --> 00:02:40.459 
this level is that it's really hard to

00:02:40.459 --> 00:02:43.180 
this level is that it's really hard to
judge<00:02:41.470> distance<00:02:42.470> like<00:02:42.739> it<00:02:42.830> looks<00:02:42.980> like<00:02:43.100> I

00:02:43.180 --> 00:02:43.190 
judge distance like it looks like I

00:02:43.190 --> 00:02:44.110 
judge distance like it looks like I
should<00:02:43.220> be<00:02:43.430> able<00:02:43.489> to<00:02:43.610> you<00:02:43.700> know<00:02:43.760> go<00:02:43.940> right<00:02:44.090> past

00:02:44.110 --> 00:02:44.120 
should be able to you know go right past

00:02:44.120 --> 00:02:46.920 
should be able to you know go right past
that<00:02:44.540> mind<00:02:44.780> easily<00:02:45.260> but<00:02:45.440> nope<00:02:45.680> still<00:02:46.640> hits<00:02:46.819> me

00:02:46.920 --> 00:02:46.930 
that mind easily but nope still hits me

00:02:46.930 --> 00:02:50.740 
that mind easily but nope still hits me
and<00:02:47.930> when<00:02:48.140> you<00:02:48.230> get<00:02:48.410> hit<00:02:48.560> by<00:02:48.590> a<00:02:48.739> mine<00:02:49.750> you're

00:02:50.740 --> 00:02:50.750 
and when you get hit by a mine you're

00:02:50.750 --> 00:02:52.300 
and when you get hit by a mine you're
pretty<00:02:50.959> much<00:02:51.049> screwed<00:02:51.260> because<00:02:51.590> your<00:02:52.069> grip

00:02:52.300 --> 00:02:52.310 
pretty much screwed because your grip

00:02:52.310 --> 00:02:55.690 
pretty much screwed because your grip
gauge<00:02:52.840> rapidly<00:02:53.840> decreases<00:02:54.470> and<00:02:54.739> you'll<00:02:55.310> never

00:02:55.690 --> 00:02:55.700 
gauge rapidly decreases and you'll never

00:02:55.700 --> 00:03:04.680 
gauge rapidly decreases and you'll never
have<00:02:55.970> enough<00:02:56.239> to<00:02:56.450> reach<00:02:56.600> the<00:02:56.840> next<00:02:56.989> girder

00:03:04.680 --> 00:03:04.690 

00:03:04.690 --> 00:03:08.349 

Ryan's<00:03:05.690> got<00:03:05.900> the<00:03:06.579> this<00:03:07.579> mission<00:03:07.970> to<00:03:08.150> that<00:03:08.329> I

00:03:08.349 --> 00:03:08.359 
Ryan's got the this mission to that I

00:03:08.359 --> 00:03:10.650 
Ryan's got the this mission to that I
didn't<00:03:08.570> show<00:03:08.780> all<00:03:09.019> of<00:03:09.049> it

00:03:10.650 --> 00:03:10.660 
didn't show all of it

00:03:10.660 --> 00:03:14.289 
didn't show all of it
thankfully<00:03:11.660> with<00:03:11.840> Rhydon<00:03:12.459> you<00:03:13.459> can<00:03:13.730> there's

00:03:14.289 --> 00:03:14.299 
thankfully with Rhydon you can there's

00:03:14.299 --> 00:03:16.479 
thankfully with Rhydon you can there's
only<00:03:14.480> one<00:03:14.750> spot<00:03:15.109> where<00:03:15.350> you<00:03:15.440> actually<00:03:15.890> have<00:03:16.459> to

00:03:16.479 --> 00:03:16.489 
only one spot where you actually have to

00:03:16.489 --> 00:03:21.839 
only one spot where you actually have to
wait<00:03:16.970> which<00:03:17.900> is<00:03:18.019> right<00:03:18.230> here

00:03:21.839 --> 00:03:21.849 

00:03:21.849 --> 00:03:23.520 

for<00:03:22.420> the<00:03:22.480> rest<00:03:22.689> of<00:03:22.749> the<00:03:22.870> level<00:03:23.109> you<00:03:23.200> can<00:03:23.379> just

00:03:23.520 --> 00:03:23.530 
for the rest of the level you can just

00:03:23.530 --> 00:03:25.890 
for the rest of the level you can just
bolt<00:03:23.709> straight<00:03:24.159> through<00:03:24.430> it<00:03:24.609> and<00:03:24.790> you'll<00:03:25.150> go

00:03:25.890 --> 00:03:25.900 
bolt straight through it and you'll go

00:03:25.900 --> 00:03:28.470 
bolt straight through it and you'll go
right<00:03:25.930> between<00:03:26.769> all<00:03:27.010> the<00:03:27.159> guards<00:03:27.489> with<00:03:28.180> snake

00:03:28.470 --> 00:03:28.480 
right between all the guards with snake

00:03:28.480 --> 00:03:30.599 
right between all the guards with snake
there<00:03:29.439> there<00:03:29.799> are<00:03:29.889> a<00:03:29.920> lot<00:03:30.069> more<00:03:30.219> places<00:03:30.459> where

00:03:30.599 --> 00:03:30.609 
there there are a lot more places where

00:03:30.609 --> 00:03:33.270 
there there are a lot more places where
you<00:03:30.790> have<00:03:30.939> to<00:03:31.060> sit<00:03:31.299> and<00:03:31.450> wait<00:03:31.599> because<00:03:32.280> the

00:03:33.270 --> 00:03:33.280 
you have to sit and wait because the

00:03:33.280 --> 00:03:35.250 
you have to sit and wait because the
guards<00:03:33.579> are<00:03:33.730> in<00:03:33.760> slightly<00:03:34.540> different<00:03:34.689> spots

00:03:35.250 --> 00:03:35.260 
guards are in slightly different spots

00:03:35.260 --> 00:03:38.160 
guards are in slightly different spots
and<00:03:35.849> move<00:03:36.849> around<00:03:37.090> at<00:03:37.299> different<00:03:37.329> times

00:03:38.160 --> 00:03:38.170 
and move around at different times

00:03:38.170 --> 00:03:41.399 
and move around at different times
and<00:03:38.650> they<00:03:38.859> just<00:03:39.010> have<00:03:39.189> a<00:03:39.299> much<00:03:40.299> larger<00:03:40.629> cone<00:03:41.260> of

00:03:41.399 --> 00:03:41.409 
and they just have a much larger cone of

00:03:41.409 --> 00:03:45.059 
and they just have a much larger cone of
vision<00:03:41.439> when<00:03:42.189> you<00:03:42.310> play<00:03:42.489> a<00:03:42.519> snake<00:03:43.709> and<00:03:44.709> of

00:03:45.059 --> 00:03:45.069 
vision when you play a snake and of

00:03:45.069 --> 00:03:47.940 
vision when you play a snake and of
course<00:03:45.280> when<00:03:45.549> the<00:03:45.730> guards<00:03:46.030> roar<00:03:46.650> they<00:03:47.650> look

00:03:47.940 --> 00:03:47.950 
course when the guards roar they look

00:03:47.950 --> 00:03:50.909 
course when the guards roar they look
upwards<00:03:48.700> and<00:03:49.060> so<00:03:49.870> they<00:03:50.139> won't<00:03:50.260> be<00:03:50.469> able<00:03:50.500> to<00:03:50.709> see

00:03:50.909 --> 00:03:50.919 
upwards and so they won't be able to see

00:03:50.919 --> 00:03:52.409 
upwards and so they won't be able to see
you<00:03:51.010> during<00:03:51.249> that<00:03:51.370> time<00:03:51.579> unless<00:03:51.999> you're<00:03:52.209> on<00:03:52.299> an

00:03:52.409 --> 00:03:52.419 
you during that time unless you're on an

00:03:52.419 --> 00:03:56.159 
you during that time unless you're on an
upper<00:03:52.719> floor<00:03:52.749> like<00:03:53.200> here<00:03:53.620> if<00:03:54.400> they<00:03:54.819> roar<00:03:55.180> they

00:03:56.159 --> 00:03:56.169 
upper floor like here if they roar they

00:03:56.169 --> 00:03:59.159 
upper floor like here if they roar they
can<00:03:56.469> still<00:03:56.680> spot<00:03:56.950> you
