00:02:39.800 --> 00:02:39.810 
you take the split ring off once again

00:02:39.810 --> 00:02:42.770 
you take the split ring off once again
and<00:02:40.590> you<00:02:40.680> take<00:02:40.890> that<00:02:41.100> nose<00:02:41.370> and<00:02:42.239> you<00:02:42.329> just<00:02:42.540> grip

00:02:42.770 --> 00:02:42.780 
and you take that nose and you just grip

00:02:42.780 --> 00:02:44.449 
and you take that nose and you just grip
it<00:02:42.810> head-on<00:02:43.170> like<00:02:43.320> that<00:02:43.739> and<00:02:44.040> bend<00:02:44.280> it<00:02:44.430> down

00:02:44.449 --> 00:02:44.459

00:02:46.610 --> 00:02:46.620 
just a little bit and all that does is

00:02:46.620 --> 00:02:48.830 
just a little bit and all that does is
change<00:02:47.130> the<00:02:47.370> pull<00:02:47.579> point<00:02:47.910> of<00:02:48.120> the<00:02:48.239> plug<00:02:48.480> so

change the pull point of the plug so

00:02:48.840 --> 00:02:51.500 
change the pull point of the plug so
that<00:02:49.380> you<00:02:49.500> get<00:02:49.709> a<00:02:49.739> weight<00:02:49.980> or<00:02:50.160> wobble<00:02:50.610> a<00:02:50.820> lot<00:02:51.360> of
