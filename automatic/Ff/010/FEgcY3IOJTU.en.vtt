00:02:33.030 --> 00:02:33.040 
happen T and this is not really a good

00:02:33.040 --> 00:02:35.790 
happen T and this is not really a good
thing<00:02:33.100> in<00:02:34.030> the<00:02:34.150> long<00:02:34.180> run<00:02:34.360> unless<00:02:34.870> he<00:02:35.320> comes

00:02:35.790 --> 00:02:35.800 
thing in the long run unless he comes

00:02:35.800 --> 00:02:38.190 
thing in the long run unless he comes
down<00:02:36.070> and<00:02:36.370> says<00:02:36.400> this<00:02:37.030> guy<00:02:37.390> this<00:02:37.450> is<00:02:37.630> it<00:02:37.930> and

00:02:38.190 --> 00:02:38.200 
down and says this guy this is it and

00:02:38.200 --> 00:02:39.630 
down and says this guy this is it and
he's<00:02:38.440> going<00:02:38.620> to<00:02:38.680> be<00:02:38.800> doing<00:02:38.890> for<00:02:39.220> the<00:02:39.280> rest<00:02:39.340> of

00:02:39.630 --> 00:02:39.640 
he's going to be doing for the rest of

00:02:39.640 --> 00:02:41.910 
he's going to be doing for the rest of
the<00:02:39.760> year<00:02:39.910> but<00:02:40.120> going<00:02:41.050> back<00:02:41.230> for<00:02:41.530> it<00:02:41.560> is<00:02:41.620> hard

00:02:41.910 --> 00:02:41.920 
the year but going back for it is hard

00:02:41.920 --> 00:02:43.680 
the year but going back for it is hard
and<00:02:42.160> I<00:02:42.310> think<00:02:42.459> it's<00:02:42.550> hard<00:02:42.730> on<00:02:42.790> the<00:02:42.910> team<00:02:43.150> so

00:02:43.680 --> 00:02:43.690 
and I think it's hard on the team so

00:02:43.690 --> 00:02:47.760 
and I think it's hard on the team so
hopefully<00:02:44.470> they<00:02:44.860> get<00:02:45.010> it<00:02:45.160> handled<00:02:46.060> and<00:02:46.770> name

00:02:47.760 --> 00:02:47.770 
hopefully they get it handled and name

00:02:47.770 --> 00:02:49.230 
hopefully they get it handled and name
somebody<00:02:48.070> to<00:02:48.280> start<00:02:48.520> for<00:02:48.760> the<00:02:48.790> rest<00:02:49.000> of<00:02:49.120> the

00:02:49.230 --> 00:02:49.240 
somebody to start for the rest of the

00:02:49.240 --> 00:02:50.760 
somebody to start for the rest of the
year<00:02:49.360> not<00:02:49.660> have<00:02:49.870> somebody<00:02:50.230> looking<00:02:50.470> over<00:02:50.560> the

00:02:50.760 --> 00:02:50.770 
year not have somebody looking over the
