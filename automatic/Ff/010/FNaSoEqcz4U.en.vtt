7 mb of your RAM when you close this

00:00:48.210 --> 00:00:55.340 
7 mb of your RAM when you close this
process<00:00:49.070> and<00:00:51.020> then<00:00:52.020> you<00:00:52.170> send<00:00:52.469> a<00:00:52.559> file<00:00:54.350> like

00:00:55.340 --> 00:00:55.350 
process and then you send a file like

00:00:55.350 --> 00:01:00.580 
process and then you send a file like
this<00:00:55.590> file<00:00:58.100> it<00:00:59.100> does<00:00:59.280> not<00:00:59.430> create<00:00:59.670> a<00:00:59.789> shortcut

00:01:00.580 --> 00:01:00.590 
this file it does not create a shortcut

00:01:00.590 --> 00:01:02.990 
this file it does not create a shortcut
so<00:01:01.590> the<00:01:01.680> problem<00:01:02.039> is<00:01:02.129> when<00:01:02.399> you<00:01:02.520> start<00:01:02.850> your

00:01:02.990 --> 00:01:03.000 
so the problem is when you start your

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:05.509 
so the problem is when you start your
computer<00:01:03.449> it<00:01:03.930> automatically<00:01:04.409> starts<00:01:04.769> so

00:01:05.509 --> 00:01:05.519 
computer it automatically starts so

00:01:05.519 --> 00:01:07.280 
computer it automatically starts so
every<00:01:05.850> time<00:01:06.030> you<00:01:06.180> do<00:01:06.360> not<00:01:06.390> want<00:01:06.600> to<00:01:06.750> into<00:01:07.200> the
