00:01:05.649 --> 00:01:05.659 
than for them to move back up the hill I

00:01:05.659 --> 00:01:07.969 
than for them to move back up the hill I
always<00:01:06.659> drive<00:01:06.930> with<00:01:07.140> my<00:01:07.260> lights<00:01:07.500> on<00:01:07.710> because

00:01:07.969 --> 00:01:07.979 
always drive with my lights on because

00:01:07.979 --> 00:01:10.070 
always drive with my lights on because
someone<00:01:08.520> coming<00:01:08.850> towards<00:01:09.210> me<00:01:09.270> might<00:01:09.570> catch<00:01:09.900> a

00:01:11.450 --> 00:01:11.460 
glimpse of my lights as an early warning

00:01:11.460 --> 00:01:15.320 
glimpse of my lights as an early warning
and<00:01:12.229> in<00:01:13.229> the<00:01:13.320> bush<00:01:13.560> I<00:01:13.799> turn<00:01:14.250> off<00:01:14.280> the<00:01:14.460> CD<00:01:14.850> player

00:01:15.320 --> 00:01:15.330 
and in the bush I turn off the CD player

00:01:15.330 --> 00:01:17.690 
and in the bush I turn off the CD player
so<00:01:15.990> I<00:01:16.020> increase<00:01:16.530> my<00:01:16.560> chances<00:01:16.770> of<00:01:17.220> hearing<00:01:17.490> an
