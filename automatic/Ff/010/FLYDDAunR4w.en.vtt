00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.480
 in this video I will try to you 

00:00:01.740 --> 00:00:05.640
 explain as simply as possible 

00:00:03.480 --> 00:00:14.910
 what rotator cuff does it mean 

00:00:05.640 --> 00:00:17.270
 serves and how to strengthen them here at 

00:00:14.910 --> 00:00:18.980
 what does the human body look like 

00:00:17.270 --> 00:00:21.640
 and the part that interests us here and 

00:00:18.980 --> 00:00:21.640
 shoulder 

00:00:23.100 --> 00:00:27.980
 we have here the humerus which is attached to the 

00:00:25.500 --> 00:00:27.980
 scapula 

00:00:29.480 --> 00:00:33.500
 so for that light and happens 

00:00:31.670 --> 00:00:35.989
 kapil abl there is what's called the 

00:00:33.500 --> 00:00:37.990
 rotator cuff and its compounds of 

00:00:35.989 --> 00:00:40.240
 four small mu 

00:00:37.990 --> 00:00:42.750
 we have the scapular muscle that is 

00:00:40.240 --> 00:00:46.440
 found on the opposite side 

00:00:42.750 --> 00:00:48.629
 here is the thorny supras 

00:00:46.440 --> 00:00:53.129
 and both in the back are a real 

00:00:48.629 --> 00:00:54.870
 pinot and pumpkin and c4 muscles are 

00:00:53.129 --> 00:00:58.129
 there to stabilize and ensure the 

00:00:54.870 --> 00:00:58.129
 maintaining the shoulder joint 

00:01:00.240 --> 00:01:04.130
 and especially that of course we have the deltoid 

00:01:05.370 --> 00:01:09.210
 why it's important to strengthen 

00:01:06.840 --> 00:01:10.590
 his four small muscles unlike 

00:01:09.210 --> 00:01:10.860
 at the big joints of the bottom of the 

00:01:10.590 --> 00:01:13.110
 body 

00:01:10.860 --> 00:01:15.120
 there is not a solid match and on 

00:01:13.110 --> 00:01:16.910
 the shoulder joint and in addition 

00:01:15.120 --> 00:01:18.840
 it's very fragile 

00:01:16.910 --> 00:01:20.610
 the four muscles the headdress of the 

00:01:18.840 --> 00:01:23.490
 rotators are the key to ensuring the 

00:01:20.610 --> 00:01:24.990
 stability of the complex phone account 

00:01:23.490 --> 00:01:26.640
 given the relatively small size of 

00:01:24.990 --> 00:01:28.710
 his muscles we ask them enormously 

00:01:26.640 --> 00:01:29.070
 and break at his something of 

00:01:28.710 --> 00:01:31.230
 current 

00:01:29.070 --> 00:01:33.500
 so strengthening them is a very very 

00:01:31.230 --> 00:01:33.500
 good idea 

00:01:38.780 --> 00:01:42.590
 here are some exercises that you can 

00:01:40.700 --> 00:01:45.590
 to make it be with an elastic a 

00:01:42.590 --> 00:01:47.570
 pulley where we alternate attention there is 

00:01:45.590 --> 00:01:47.990
 not that these exercises there are a lot 

00:01:47.570 --> 00:01:49.700
 other 

00:01:47.990 --> 00:01:51.350
 but if you already do what I do you 

00:01:49.700 --> 00:01:52.580
 watch the video once a week a 

00:01:51.350 --> 00:01:56.920
 series of fifteen repetitions 

00:01:52.580 --> 00:01:56.920
 every exercise will be pretty good 

00:02:30.970 --> 00:02:32.970
 and 

00:03:57.670 --> 00:04:01.580
 I hope you have learned 

00:04:00.140 --> 00:04:03.049
 something new and that you 

00:04:01.580 --> 00:04:03.790
 go do these exercises at least one 

00:04:03.049 --> 00:04:07.989
 times per week 

00:04:03.790 --> 00:04:07.989
 thank you and see you next video
