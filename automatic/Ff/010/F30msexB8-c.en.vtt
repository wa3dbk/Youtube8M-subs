00:00:17.250 --> 00:00:19.760 
can see a 4 multiplayer maps zombies not
as<00:00:17.460> you<00:00:17.580> would<00:00:17.670> expect<00:00:17.820> and<00:00:18.270> a<00:00:18.779> bonus<00:00:19.380> weapon

00:00:19.760 --> 00:00:19.770 
as you would expect and a bonus weapon

00:00:19.770 --> 00:00:21.710 
as you would expect and a bonus weapon
we've<00:00:20.160> been<00:00:20.310> promised<00:00:20.670> that<00:00:20.880> the<00:00:21.090> Peacekeeper

00:00:21.710 --> 00:00:21.720 
we've been promised that the Peacekeeper

00:00:21.720 --> 00:00:23.179 
we've been promised that the Peacekeeper
was<00:00:21.869> going<00:00:21.990> to<00:00:22.050> be<00:00:22.109> the<00:00:22.230> last<00:00:22.439> bonus<00:00:22.710> weapon

00:00:23.179 --> 00:00:23.189 
was going to be the last bonus weapon

00:00:23.189 --> 00:00:25.490 
was going to be the last bonus weapon
from<00:00:23.340> water<00:00:23.550> player<00:00:23.880> but<00:00:24.420> I<00:00:24.449> guess<00:00:24.750> that<00:00:25.199> they

00:00:25.490 --> 00:00:25.500 
from water player but I guess that they

00:00:25.500 --> 00:00:27.259 
from water player but I guess that they
never<00:00:25.710> said<00:00:25.949> anything<00:00:26.220> about<00:00:26.400> the<00:00:26.670> zombies<00:00:27.060> so

00:00:27.259 --> 00:00:27.269 
never said anything about the zombies so

00:00:27.269 --> 00:00:29.450 
never said anything about the zombies so
it<00:00:27.359> looks<00:00:27.570> like<00:00:27.660> the<00:00:27.930> ray<00:00:28.199> gun<00:00:28.439> mark<00:00:28.680> 2<00:00:28.740> could

00:00:29.450 --> 00:00:29.460 
it looks like the ray gun mark 2 could

00:00:29.460 --> 00:00:30.980 
it looks like the ray gun mark 2 could
be<00:00:29.609> the<00:00:29.760> bonus<00:00:30.090> weapon<00:00:30.390> for<00:00:30.570> zombies<00:00:30.840> and<00:00:30.929> I'm

00:00:30.980 --> 00:00:30.990 
be the bonus weapon for zombies and I'm

00:00:30.990 --> 00:00:32.510 
be the bonus weapon for zombies and I'm
going<00:00:31.109> to<00:00:31.170> be<00:00:31.230> talking<00:00:31.410> not<00:00:31.980> about<00:00:32.009> the<00:00:32.309> image

00:00:32.510 --> 00:00:32.520 
going to be talking not about the image

00:00:32.520 --> 00:00:33.380 
going to be talking not about the image
because<00:00:32.850> you<00:00:32.910> can<00:00:33.059> make<00:00:33.210> your<00:00:33.329> own

00:00:33.380 --> 00:00:33.390 
because you can make your own

00:00:33.390 --> 00:00:34.729 
because you can make your own
assumptions<00:00:33.870> on<00:00:33.989> that<00:00:34.170> you<00:00:34.230> can<00:00:34.410> read<00:00:34.559> what

00:00:34.729 --> 00:00:34.739 
assumptions on that you can read what

00:00:34.739 --> 00:00:36.200 
assumptions on that you can read what
the<00:00:34.860> maps<00:00:35.070> off<00:00:35.309> and<00:00:35.489> left<00:00:35.640> to<00:00:35.850> right<00:00:35.969> of<00:00:36.059> course

00:00:36.200 --> 00:00:36.210 
the maps off and left to right of course

00:00:36.210 --> 00:00:39.260 
the maps off and left to right of course
it's<00:00:36.450> Cove<00:00:36.750> detour<00:00:37.500> rush<00:00:37.920> and<00:00:38.190> uplink<00:00:38.760> and<00:00:38.969> the

00:00:39.260 --> 00:00:39.270 
it's Cove detour rush and uplink and the

00:00:39.270 --> 00:00:40.970 
it's Cove detour rush and uplink and the
zombies<00:00:39.390> map<00:00:39.780> called<00:00:40.020> buried<00:00:40.410> in<00:00:40.530> so<00:00:40.739> I'm<00:00:40.860> not

00:00:40.970 --> 00:00:40.980 
zombies map called buried in so I'm not

00:00:40.980 --> 00:00:42.889 
zombies map called buried in so I'm not
going<00:00:41.129> to<00:00:41.190> lecture<00:00:41.399> on<00:00:41.700> what<00:00:41.850> those<00:00:42.059> names<00:00:42.629> of

00:00:42.889 --> 00:00:42.899 
going to lecture on what those names of

00:00:42.899 --> 00:00:44.119 
going to lecture on what those names of
the<00:00:42.989> maps<00:00:43.200> not<00:00:43.379> mean<00:00:43.559> because<00:00:43.739> you<00:00:43.829> can<00:00:43.980> see

00:00:44.119 --> 00:00:44.129 
the maps not mean because you can see

00:00:44.129 --> 00:00:45.470 
the maps not mean because you can see
very<00:00:44.340> little<00:00:44.399> from<00:00:44.760> the<00:00:44.910> images<00:00:45.239> and<00:00:45.270> it's

00:00:45.470 --> 00:00:45.480 
very little from the images and it's

00:00:45.480 --> 00:00:47.150 
very little from the images and it's
really<00:00:45.690> hard<00:00:45.780> to<00:00:46.020> tell<00:00:46.230> what<00:00:46.469> any<00:00:46.710> of<00:00:46.980> those

00:00:47.150 --> 00:00:47.160 
really hard to tell what any of those

00:00:47.160 --> 00:00:48.260 
really hard to tell what any of those
maps<00:00:47.460> are<00:00:47.579> but<00:00:47.760> I'm<00:00:47.820> going<00:00:47.940> to<00:00:48.000> be<00:00:48.059> talking

00:00:48.260 --> 00:00:48.270

Buried<00:00:51.390> map<00:00:51.570> and<00:00:51.780> some<00:00:51.930> theories<00:00:52.320> about<00:00:52.559> where

00:00:52.790 --> 00:00:52.800 
Buried map and some theories about where

00:00:52.800 --> 00:00:55.040 
Buried map and some theories about where
and<00:00:53.039> when<00:00:53.280> this<00:00:53.460> could<00:00:53.699> be<00:00:53.850> set<00:00:54.120> so<00:00:54.660> this<00:00:54.809> image

00:00:55.040 --> 00:00:55.050

that you can see it's pretty much all

00:00:56.370 --> 00:00:58.430 
that you can see it's pretty much all
we've<00:00:56.520> got<00:00:56.699> to<00:00:56.820> work<00:00:56.969> from<00:00:57.300> it's<00:00:57.629> not<00:00:57.840> great<00:00:58.140> to

00:00:58.430 --> 00:00:58.440 
we've got to work from it's not great to

00:00:58.440 --> 00:01:00.380 
we've got to work from it's not great to
see<00:00:58.649> what<00:00:58.920> you<00:00:59.129> know<00:00:59.309> what<00:00:59.879> the<00:01:00.030> whole<00:01:00.180> map

00:01:00.380 --> 00:01:00.390 
see what you know what the whole map

00:01:00.390 --> 00:01:02.150 
see what you know what the whole map
could<00:01:00.600> be<00:01:00.750> like<00:01:00.930> from<00:01:01.170> this<00:01:01.350> one<00:01:01.559> tiny<00:01:01.859> image

00:01:02.150 --> 00:01:02.160 
could be like from this one tiny image

00:01:02.160 --> 00:01:03.740 
could be like from this one tiny image
there's<00:01:02.520> not<00:01:02.640> even<00:01:02.670> the<00:01:02.940> best<00:01:02.969> of<00:01:03.329> qualities

00:01:03.740 --> 00:01:03.750 
there's not even the best of qualities

00:01:03.750 --> 00:01:05.179 
there's not even the best of qualities
anyway<00:01:04.019> but<00:01:04.170> what<00:01:04.350> we<00:01:04.439> can<00:01:04.619> see<00:01:04.830> from<00:01:04.860> this

00:01:05.179 --> 00:01:05.189 
anyway but what we can see from this

00:01:05.189 --> 00:01:07.130 
anyway but what we can see from this
image<00:01:05.489> is<00:01:05.640> that<00:01:06.180> this<00:01:06.360> the<00:01:06.689> zombie<00:01:06.960> in<00:01:07.049> the

00:01:07.130 --> 00:01:07.140 
image is that this the zombie in the

00:01:07.140 --> 00:01:09.380 
image is that this the zombie in the

like<00:01:20.880> I<00:01:21.060> know<00:01:21.210> farm<00:01:21.630> Cano<00:01:22.290> wasn't<00:01:23.070> really<00:01:23.430> much

00:01:23.570 --> 00:01:23.580 
like I know farm Cano wasn't really much

00:01:23.580 --> 00:01:25.550 
like I know farm Cano wasn't really much
of<00:01:23.640> a<00:01:23.850> zombies<00:01:24.180> map<00:01:24.360> but<00:01:24.509> we<00:01:24.600> have<00:01:24.810> kind<00:01:25.200> of<00:01:25.380> had

00:01:25.550 --> 00:01:25.560 
of a zombies map but we have kind of had

00:01:25.560 --> 00:01:27.859 
of a zombies map but we have kind of had
a<00:01:25.590> farm<00:01:25.950> up<00:01:26.189> already<00:01:26.549> in<00:01:26.790> form<00:01:27.150> so<00:01:27.479> i<00:01:27.509> think<00:01:27.780> the

00:01:27.859 --> 00:01:27.869 
a farm up already in form so i think the

00:01:27.869 --> 00:01:30.200 
a farm up already in form so i think the
cowboy<00:01:28.290> hat<00:01:28.470> kind<00:01:28.860> of<00:01:29.009> makes<00:01:29.189> more<00:01:29.430> sense<00:01:29.790> and

00:01:30.200 --> 00:01:30.210 
cowboy hat kind of makes more sense and

00:01:30.210 --> 00:01:32.270 
cowboy hat kind of makes more sense and
why<00:01:31.200> the<00:01:31.229> underground<00:01:31.829> world<00:01:32.009> looks<00:01:32.250> like

00:01:32.270 --> 00:01:32.280 
why the underground world looks like

00:01:32.280 --> 00:01:34.789 
why the underground world looks like
some<00:01:32.520> kind<00:01:32.549> of<00:01:32.759> mine<00:01:33.000> shaft<00:01:33.360> to<00:01:33.509> me<00:01:33.630> and<00:01:33.810> in

00:01:34.789 --> 00:01:34.799 
some kind of mine shaft to me and in

00:01:34.799 --> 00:01:37.069 
some kind of mine shaft to me and in
that<00:01:34.860> in<00:01:35.310> those<00:01:35.490> kind<00:01:35.820> of<00:01:35.880> western<00:01:36.450> times<00:01:36.810> it

00:01:37.069 --> 00:01:37.079 
that in those kind of western times it

00:01:37.079 --> 00:01:38.929 
that in those kind of western times it
was<00:01:37.229> all<00:01:37.409> about<00:01:37.590> the<00:01:37.770> riches<00:01:38.159> and<00:01:38.340> you<00:01:38.490> know<00:01:38.640> it

00:01:38.929 --> 00:01:38.939 
was all about the riches and you know it

00:01:38.939 --> 00:01:40.910 
was all about the riches and you know it
was<00:01:39.210> that<00:01:39.360> kind<00:01:39.509> of<00:01:39.600> area<00:01:39.930> where<00:01:40.140> everything

00:01:40.910 --> 00:01:40.920 
was that kind of area where everything

00:01:40.920 --> 00:01:42.740 
was that kind of area where everything
was<00:01:41.009> booming<00:01:41.460> and<00:01:41.549> especially<00:01:42.270> things<00:01:42.630> like

00:01:42.740 --> 00:01:42.750 
was booming and especially things like

00:01:42.750 --> 00:01:45.050 
was booming and especially things like
coal<00:01:43.200> and<00:01:43.619> you<00:01:44.369> know<00:01:44.490> if<00:01:44.700> you<00:01:44.820> were<00:01:44.909> looking

00:01:45.050 --> 00:01:45.060

00:01:47.420 --> 00:01:47.430 
off to find them gold and diamonds solos

00:01:47.430 --> 00:01:48.980 
off to find them gold and diamonds solos
to<00:01:47.579> me<00:01:47.670> like<00:01:47.820> it's<00:01:47.970> some<00:01:48.149> kind<00:01:48.360> of<00:01:48.420> mine<00:01:48.659> shaft

00:01:48.980 --> 00:01:48.990 
to me like it's some kind of mine shaft

00:01:48.990 --> 00:01:51.590 
to me like it's some kind of mine shaft
on<00:01:49.170> the<00:01:49.320> ground<00:01:49.590> and<00:01:49.890> and<00:01:50.490> the<00:01:50.880> zombies<00:01:51.030> are<00:01:51.329> in

00:01:51.590 --> 00:01:51.600 
on the ground and and the zombies are in

00:01:51.600 --> 00:01:53.630 
on the ground and and the zombies are in
it<00:01:51.720> for<00:01:51.930> whatever<00:01:52.590> reason<00:01:53.100> now<00:01:53.399> there<00:01:53.520> is<00:01:53.610> a

00:01:53.630 --> 00:01:53.640 
it for whatever reason now there is a

00:01:53.640 --> 00:01:55.460 
it for whatever reason now there is a
theory<00:01:54.060> and<00:01:54.149> been<00:01:54.329> some<00:01:54.509> rumors<00:01:54.689> that<00:01:55.049> it<00:01:55.110> the

00:01:55.460 --> 00:01:55.470 
theory and been some rumors that it the

00:01:55.470 --> 00:01:57.050 
theory and been some rumors that it the
next<00:01:55.619> on<00:01:55.860> this<00:01:56.009> map<00:01:56.159> would<00:01:56.369> be<00:01:56.549> an<00:01:56.759> underground

00:01:57.050 --> 00:01:57.060 
next on this map would be an underground

00:01:57.060 --> 00:01:59.149 
next on this map would be an underground
zombies<00:01:57.600> map<00:01:57.810> and<00:01:58.079> from<00:01:58.350> what<00:01:58.530> I've<00:01:58.649> heard<00:01:58.680> it

00:01:59.149 --> 00:01:59.159 
zombies map and from what I've heard it

00:01:59.159 --> 00:02:01.340 
zombies map and from what I've heard it
is<00:01:59.610> that<00:01:59.880> and<00:02:00.479> this<00:02:00.719> just<00:02:00.990> one<00:02:01.140> of<00:02:01.259> the

00:02:01.340 --> 00:02:01.350 
is that and this just one of the

00:02:01.350 --> 00:02:02.959 
is that and this just one of the
theories<00:02:01.590> and<00:02:01.799> whether<00:02:02.100> this<00:02:02.250> is<00:02:02.310> going<00:02:02.700> to<00:02:02.850> be

00:02:02.959 --> 00:02:02.969 
theories and whether this is going to be

00:02:02.969 --> 00:02:05.270 
theories and whether this is going to be
true<00:02:03.240> but<00:02:03.600> it's<00:02:03.780> that<00:02:03.930> it<00:02:04.079> set<00:02:04.350> about<00:02:04.590> 60<00:02:05.189> years

00:02:05.270 --> 00:02:05.280 
true but it's that it set about 60 years

00:02:05.280 --> 00:02:07.999 
true but it's that it set about 60 years
on<00:02:05.490> from<00:02:05.670> 2025<00:02:06.390> surround<00:02:06.780> 2085<00:02:07.590> or<00:02:07.799> something

00:02:07.999 --> 00:02:08.009 
on from 2025 surround 2085 or something

00:02:08.009 --> 00:02:11.029 
on from 2025 surround 2085 or something
like<00:02:08.129> that<00:02:08.190> and<00:02:08.690> the<00:02:09.690> whole<00:02:09.989> world<00:02:10.410> has<00:02:10.830> been

00:02:11.029 --> 00:02:11.039 
like that and the whole world has been

00:02:11.039 --> 00:02:13.520 
like that and the whole world has been
pretty<00:02:11.340> much<00:02:11.520> destroyed<00:02:12.030> normal<00:02:12.930> humans<00:02:13.319> all

00:02:13.520 --> 00:02:13.530 
pretty much destroyed normal humans all

00:02:13.530 --> 00:02:13.790 
pretty much destroyed normal humans all
those

00:02:13.790 --> 00:02:13.800 
those

00:02:13.800 --> 00:02:15.890 
those
zombies<00:02:14.070> as<00:02:14.220> well<00:02:14.430> have<00:02:14.880> been<00:02:15.090> destroyed<00:02:15.630> by

zombies as well have been destroyed by

00:02:15.900 --> 00:02:18.410 
zombies as well have been destroyed by
this<00:02:16.040> thing<00:02:17.040> that<00:02:17.250> the<00:02:17.490> humans<00:02:17.910> have<00:02:18.060> built<00:02:18.270> to

00:02:18.410 --> 00:02:18.420 
this thing that the humans have built to

00:02:18.420 --> 00:02:20.240 
this thing that the humans have built to
destroy<00:02:18.810> the<00:02:18.930> zombies<00:02:19.260> and<00:02:19.410> to<00:02:19.890> dispose<00:02:20.220> of

underground<00:02:25.860> and<00:02:26.310> that<00:02:26.700> is<00:02:26.790> how<00:02:26.970> they've<00:02:27.150> got

00:02:27.320 --> 00:02:27.330 
underground and that is how they've got

00:02:27.330 --> 00:02:28.940 
underground and that is how they've got
into<00:02:27.480> this<00:02:27.720> situation<00:02:27.780> of<00:02:28.440> being<00:02:28.470> in<00:02:28.830> the

into this situation of being in the
underground<00:02:29.370> map<00:02:29.580> I<00:02:29.700> don't<00:02:29.880> know<00:02:29.970> the<00:02:30.210> exact

00:02:30.890 --> 00:02:30.900 
underground map I don't know the exact

00:02:30.900 --> 00:02:33.320 
underground map I don't know the exact
details<00:02:31.050> of<00:02:31.500> what<00:02:31.800> this<00:02:32.010> story<00:02:32.820> is<00:02:32.910> but<00:02:33.120> it's

00:02:33.320 --> 00:02:33.330 
details of what this story is but it's

00:02:33.330 --> 00:02:35.180 
details of what this story is but it's
just<00:02:33.540> ideas<00:02:34.080> bouncing<00:02:34.530> around<00:02:34.620> as<00:02:34.860> to<00:02:35.010> how

00:02:35.180 --> 00:02:35.190 
just ideas bouncing around as to how

00:02:35.190 --> 00:02:36.980 
just ideas bouncing around as to how
these<00:02:35.430> zombies<00:02:35.880> are<00:02:36.090> underground<00:02:36.510> and<00:02:36.780> why

00:02:36.980 --> 00:02:36.990 
these zombies are underground and why

00:02:36.990 --> 00:02:38.660 
these zombies are underground and why
and<00:02:37.290> what<00:02:37.680> they're<00:02:37.830> doing<00:02:38.130> there<00:02:38.310> we<00:02:38.550> have

00:02:38.660 --> 00:02:38.670 
and what they're doing there we have

00:02:38.670 --> 00:02:40.490 
and what they're doing there we have
more<00:02:38.850> about<00:02:39.030> this<00:02:39.180> zombies<00:02:39.660> ray<00:02:39.870> gun<00:02:40.110> mark<00:02:40.410> 2

more about this zombies ray gun mark 2

00:02:40.500 --> 00:02:42.080 
more about this zombies ray gun mark 2
so<00:02:40.950> obviously<00:02:41.310> you're<00:02:41.550> all<00:02:41.580> familiar<00:02:41.820> with

00:02:42.080 --> 00:02:42.090 
so obviously you're all familiar with

00:02:42.090 --> 00:02:44.570 
so obviously you're all familiar with
the<00:02:42.480> with<00:02:42.990> the<00:02:43.110> zombies<00:02:43.440> Reagan<00:02:43.860> no<00:02:44.250> you<00:02:44.430> can

00:02:44.570 --> 00:02:44.580 
the with the zombies Reagan no you can

00:02:44.580 --> 00:02:46.430 
the with the zombies Reagan no you can
see<00:02:44.760> from<00:02:44.940> the<00:02:45.090> image<00:02:45.120> on<00:02:45.630> screen<00:02:45.810> is<00:02:46.170> that<00:02:46.350> it

00:02:46.430 --> 00:02:46.440 
see from the image on screen is that it

00:02:46.440 --> 00:02:48.320 
see from the image on screen is that it
just<00:02:46.650> looks<00:02:46.770> like<00:02:46.830> an<00:02:47.160> extended<00:02:47.970> version<00:02:48.120> of

00:02:48.320 --> 00:02:48.330 
just looks like an extended version of

00:02:48.330 --> 00:02:50.330 
just looks like an extended version of
that<00:02:48.390> it<00:02:48.570> looks<00:02:48.750> longer<00:02:49.050> in<00:02:49.290> length<00:02:49.530> so<00:02:50.070> it<00:02:50.100> may

00:02:50.330 --> 00:02:50.340 
that it looks longer in length so it may

00:02:50.340 --> 00:02:53.330 
that it looks longer in length so it may
have<00:02:50.670> better<00:02:51.660> range<00:02:52.080> or<00:02:52.500> better<00:02:52.680> accuracy<00:02:53.100> or

00:02:53.330 --> 00:02:53.340 
have better range or better accuracy or

00:02:53.340 --> 00:02:55.190 
have better range or better accuracy or
something<00:02:53.670> like<00:02:53.730> that<00:02:53.850> not<00:02:54.480> that's<00:02:54.780> a<00:02:54.900> massive

00:02:55.190 --> 00:02:55.200 
something like that not that's a massive

00:02:55.200 --> 00:02:57.260 
something like that not that's a massive
feature<00:02:55.590> in<00:02:55.860> zombies<00:02:56.250> itself<00:02:56.670> but<00:02:57.030> you've<00:02:57.150> got

00:02:57.260 --> 00:02:57.270 
feature in zombies itself but you've got

00:02:57.270 --> 00:02:59.060 
feature in zombies itself but you've got
to<00:02:57.300> think<00:02:57.510> what<00:02:57.810> does<00:02:57.990> this<00:02:58.200> zombies<00:02:58.650> Reagan

00:02:59.060 --> 00:02:59.070 
to think what does this zombies Reagan

00:02:59.070 --> 00:03:00.770 
to think what does this zombies Reagan
actually<00:02:59.640> do<00:02:59.820> differently<00:03:00.210> from<00:03:00.360> the<00:03:00.450> other<00:03:00.660> a

00:03:00.770 --> 00:03:00.780 
actually do differently from the other a

00:03:00.780 --> 00:03:02.540 
actually do differently from the other a
gun<00:03:01.110> and<00:03:01.230> that<00:03:01.710> we've<00:03:01.860> previously<00:03:02.190> seen

00:03:02.540 --> 00:03:02.550 
gun and that we've previously seen

00:03:02.550 --> 00:03:03.830 
gun and that we've previously seen
because<00:03:02.670> they've<00:03:02.940> advertised<00:03:03.450> on<00:03:03.720> the<00:03:03.750> front

00:03:03.830 --> 00:03:03.840 
because they've advertised on the front

00:03:03.840 --> 00:03:05.840 
because they've advertised on the front
of<00:03:04.140> this<00:03:04.260> massive<00:03:04.500> marketing<00:03:05.160> poster<00:03:05.670> and

00:03:05.840 --> 00:03:05.850 
of this massive marketing poster and

00:03:05.850 --> 00:03:07.670 
of this massive marketing poster and
then<00:03:06.360> making<00:03:06.510> a<00:03:06.660> big<00:03:06.810> deal<00:03:07.020> about<00:03:07.080> it<00:03:07.380> you<00:03:07.650> know

00:03:07.670 --> 00:03:07.680 
then making a big deal about it you know

00:03:07.680 --> 00:03:09.260 
then making a big deal about it you know
it's<00:03:07.980> a<00:03:08.100> new<00:03:08.250> weapon<00:03:08.700> but<00:03:08.850> if<00:03:09.000> they're<00:03:09.150> going

00:03:09.260 --> 00:03:09.270 
it's a new weapon but if they're going

00:03:09.270 --> 00:03:11.270 
it's a new weapon but if they're going
to<00:03:09.360> put<00:03:09.510> a<00:03:09.690> new<00:03:10.110> weapon<00:03:10.530> and<00:03:10.680> make<00:03:10.830> a<00:03:10.980> new

00:03:11.270 --> 00:03:11.280 
to put a new weapon and make a new

00:03:11.280 --> 00:03:13.400 
to put a new weapon and make a new
weapon<00:03:11.700> rather<00:03:11.940> than<00:03:12.060> just<00:03:12.270> an<00:03:12.690> upgraded<00:03:13.290> or<00:03:13.380> a

00:03:13.400 --> 00:03:13.410 
weapon rather than just an upgraded or a

00:03:13.410 --> 00:03:14.720 
weapon rather than just an upgraded or a
different<00:03:13.800> version<00:03:13.950> of<00:03:14.250> a<00:03:14.400> weapon<00:03:14.550> that

00:03:14.720 --> 00:03:14.730 
different version of a weapon that

00:03:14.730 --> 00:03:16.100 
different version of a weapon that
you've<00:03:14.910> currently<00:03:15.120> got<00:03:15.300> up<00:03:15.630> kind<00:03:15.900> of<00:03:15.960> makes

00:03:16.100 --> 00:03:16.110 
you've currently got up kind of makes

00:03:16.110 --> 00:03:18.350 
you've currently got up kind of makes
sense<00:03:16.460> so<00:03:17.460> I'm<00:03:17.580> guessing<00:03:17.760> it's<00:03:18.030> going<00:03:18.180> to<00:03:18.239> be

00:03:18.350 --> 00:03:18.360 
sense so I'm guessing it's going to be

00:03:18.360 --> 00:03:20.510 
sense so I'm guessing it's going to be
quite<00:03:18.660> a<00:03:18.810> bit<00:03:19.140> different<00:03:19.650> because<00:03:19.709> they<00:03:20.370> are

00:03:20.510 --> 00:03:20.520 
quite a bit different because they are

00:03:20.520 --> 00:03:21.949 
quite a bit different because they are
marks<00:03:20.850> in<00:03:20.940> it<00:03:21.030> is<00:03:21.150> something<00:03:21.390> different<00:03:21.660> so

00:03:21.949 --> 00:03:21.959 
marks in it is something different so

00:03:21.959 --> 00:03:23.630 
marks in it is something different so
they're<00:03:22.110> not<00:03:22.260> just<00:03:22.500> going<00:03:22.709> to<00:03:22.800> upgrade<00:03:23.040> in<00:03:23.520> the

00:03:23.630 --> 00:03:23.640 
they're not just going to upgrade in the

00:03:23.640 --> 00:03:25.040 
they're not just going to upgrade in the
power<00:03:23.910> department<00:03:24.540> or<00:03:24.630> anything<00:03:24.900> like<00:03:24.930> that

00:03:25.040 --> 00:03:25.050 
power department or anything like that

00:03:25.050 --> 00:03:27.350 
power department or anything like that
or<00:03:25.350> take<00:03:25.980> the<00:03:26.130> splash<00:03:26.459> damage<00:03:26.670> off<00:03:26.970> all<00:03:27.120> things

00:03:27.350 --> 00:03:27.360 
or take the splash damage off all things

00:03:27.360 --> 00:03:28.790 
or take the splash damage off all things
like<00:03:27.540> that<00:03:27.660> I<00:03:27.840> don't<00:03:28.200> think<00:03:28.380> that<00:03:28.500> kind<00:03:28.739> of

00:03:28.790 --> 00:03:28.800 
like that I don't think that kind of

00:03:28.800 --> 00:03:30.470 
like that I don't think that kind of
makes<00:03:28.980> sense<00:03:29.220> it's<00:03:29.430> going<00:03:29.610> to<00:03:29.670> be<00:03:29.760> almost<00:03:30.030> like

00:03:30.470 --> 00:03:30.480 
makes sense it's going to be almost like

00:03:30.480 --> 00:03:32.150 
makes sense it's going to be almost like
a<00:03:30.510> brand<00:03:30.870> new<00:03:30.959> weapon<00:03:31.440> but<00:03:31.590> will<00:03:31.800> it<00:03:31.920> replace

00:03:32.150 --> 00:03:32.160 
a brand new weapon but will it replace

00:03:32.160 --> 00:03:34.340 
a brand new weapon but will it replace
the<00:03:32.250> normal<00:03:32.760> rate<00:03:32.910> good<00:03:33.090> I<00:03:33.270> would<00:03:33.810> guess<00:03:34.050> so

00:03:34.340 --> 00:03:34.350 
the normal rate good I would guess so

00:03:34.350 --> 00:03:36.110 
the normal rate good I would guess so
another<00:03:35.040> thing<00:03:35.280> is<00:03:35.310> will<00:03:35.670> it<00:03:35.700> replace<00:03:36.000> the

00:03:36.110 --> 00:03:36.120 
another thing is will it replace the

00:03:36.120 --> 00:03:38.120 
another thing is will it replace the
Reagan<00:03:36.810> in<00:03:37.050> the<00:03:37.200> previous<00:03:37.530> map<00:03:37.770> so<00:03:37.950> will<00:03:38.070> you

00:03:38.120 --> 00:03:38.130 
Reagan in the previous map so will you

00:03:38.130 --> 00:03:39.590 
Reagan in the previous map so will you
be<00:03:38.160> able<00:03:38.280> to<00:03:38.550> use<00:03:38.640> this<00:03:38.790> new<00:03:39.060> gun<00:03:39.300> that<00:03:39.480> they've

00:03:39.590 --> 00:03:39.600 
be able to use this new gun that they've

00:03:39.600 --> 00:03:41.780 
be able to use this new gun that they've
advertised<00:03:40.020> here<00:03:40.350> in<00:03:40.500> all<00:03:41.100> the<00:03:41.250> previous<00:03:41.430> map

00:03:41.780 --> 00:03:41.790 
advertised here in all the previous map

00:03:41.790 --> 00:03:43.699 
advertised here in all the previous map
so<00:03:41.970> you<00:03:42.000> know<00:03:42.209> in<00:03:42.360> transit<00:03:42.900> in<00:03:43.080> one<00:03:43.530> of<00:03:43.560> the

00:03:43.699 --> 00:03:43.709 
so you know in transit in one of the

00:03:43.709 --> 00:03:45.380 
so you know in transit in one of the
dead<00:03:43.920> in<00:03:44.070> all<00:03:44.220> those<00:03:44.400> different<00:03:44.430> zombies<00:03:45.180> maps

00:03:45.380 --> 00:03:45.390 
dead in all those different zombies maps

00:03:45.390 --> 00:03:46.910 
dead in all those different zombies maps
would<00:03:45.570> you<00:03:45.690> be<00:03:45.780> able<00:03:45.870> to<00:03:46.050> use<00:03:46.170> this<00:03:46.290> new<00:03:46.530> gun<00:03:46.739> in

00:03:46.910 --> 00:03:46.920 
would you be able to use this new gun in

00:03:46.920 --> 00:03:48.350 
would you be able to use this new gun in
those<00:03:47.340> maps<00:03:47.640> so<00:03:47.850> that's<00:03:48.060> something<00:03:48.270> that

00:03:48.350 --> 00:03:48.360 
those maps so that's something that

00:03:48.360 --> 00:03:49.910 
those maps so that's something that
we're<00:03:48.570> going<00:03:48.660> to<00:03:48.720> have<00:03:48.870> to<00:03:49.050> try<00:03:49.650> and<00:03:49.770> get

00:03:49.910 --> 00:03:49.920 
we're going to have to try and get

00:03:49.920 --> 00:03:52.520 
we're going to have to try and get
