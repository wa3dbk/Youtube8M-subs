 Minden 

00:00:11.889 --> 00:00:14.199
 at the upcoming World Cup 

00:00:14.199 --> 00:00:19.910
 We're actually waiting for released Rockstar Augusta either 

00:00:19.910 --> 00:00:22.829
 this year will be like me 

00:00:22.829 --> 00:00:25.829
 he developed components to worry or problems 

00:00:27.779 --> 00:00:29.039
 why money 

00:00:29.039 --> 00:00:32.039
 we need 

00:00:34.970 --> 00:00:37.970
 and no 

00:00:39.570 --> 00:00:43.060
 b for 

00:00:43.060 --> 00:00:46.060
 and the most important 

00:00:46.860 --> 00:00:47.810
 in this case 

00:00:47.810 --> 00:00:48.889
 November with 

00:00:48.889 --> 00:00:53.040
 Also sold Berlin brÃ¶ way to pay easier 

00:00:53.040 --> 00:00:56.040
 Danny Stam and next to the opening 

00:00:58.460 --> 00:00:59.510
 on the contrary 

00:00:59.510 --> 00:01:00.820
 Of course we need too 

00:01:00.820 --> 00:01:03.420
 Koppelin 

00:01:03.420 --> 00:01:05.530
 Miller 

00:01:05.530 --> 00:01:07.970
 Kellenberger 

00:01:07.970 --> 00:01:08.899
 now he wants 

00:01:08.899 --> 00:01:11.899
 an own goal by Oliver Thommen 

00:01:12.750 --> 00:01:15.620
 the streets 

00:01:15.620 --> 00:01:17.010
 Years start tomorrow 

00:01:17.010 --> 00:01:21.090
 Shen of a market, first, millions of Frenchmen whose true story 

00:01:21.760 --> 00:01:22.700
 it will 

00:01:22.700 --> 00:01:24.580
 they had to 

00:01:24.580 --> 00:01:27.910
 No 

00:01:27.910 --> 00:01:30.910
 final report so it does not look much better 

00:01:31.480 --> 00:01:34.910
 that's why we do not pay attention to this mystical business 

00:01:37.130 --> 00:01:39.270
 dropped as little as possible 

00:01:39.270 --> 00:01:42.270
 that will turn out in some 

00:01:47.590 --> 00:01:48.830
 hectic 

00:01:48.830 --> 00:01:50.090
 so will 

00:01:50.090 --> 00:01:52.190
 December 

00:01:52.190 --> 00:01:54.210
 will donate 

00:01:54.210 --> 00:01:57.210
 in the net Bern 

00:02:00.190 --> 00:02:03.190
 then it just happens to be incomparable 

00:02:04.590 --> 00:02:07.590
 the sauce becomes 

00:02:08.169 --> 00:02:10.939
 b now 

00:02:10.939 --> 00:02:13.129
 Hole not too small 

00:02:13.129 --> 00:02:16.929
 Norbert Haug in the Isenburg Senad 50 Euro is not coming 

00:02:16.929 --> 00:02:19.929
 so can 

00:02:21.899 --> 00:02:24.959
 So clients found the first part with GM corn 

00:02:26.339 --> 00:02:27.409
 Robert s 

00:02:27.409 --> 00:02:29.679
 both leading 

00:02:29.679 --> 00:02:31.479
 the movie lights up 

00:02:31.479 --> 00:02:32.470
 it is enough 

00:02:32.470 --> 00:02:37.250
 so louder did not follow Euro or the Munich also 

00:02:37.250 --> 00:02:40.250
 Not 

00:02:42.179 --> 00:02:45.179
 that should be enough 

00:02:46.619 --> 00:02:48.069
 Soost 

00:02:48.069 --> 00:02:51.239
 I have never forgotten about it so the cops have a little something 

00:02:51.239 --> 00:02:53.359
 tasting have to be self 

00:02:53.359 --> 00:02:55.469
 12 million of these should 

00:02:55.469 --> 00:02:58.669
 the tool otherwise you can do there we have to reload 

00:02:58.669 --> 00:03:02.799
 Variation on the need of millions of euros is required that are not 

00:03:02.799 --> 00:03:04.020
 my words no more 

00:03:04.020 --> 00:03:06.479
 there is talk this year 

00:03:06.479 --> 00:03:08.979
 furthermore 50 4 one can become easy 

00:03:08.979 --> 00:03:11.449
 now where to boil the water over and over again 

00:03:11.449 --> 00:03:15.379
 The moon so slow to look around Laux often worry 

00:03:15.379 --> 00:03:17.789
 the last time out here 

00:03:17.789 --> 00:03:20.089
 who go upstairs and 

00:03:20.089 --> 00:03:21.599
 Schumer 

00:03:21.599 --> 00:03:23.249
 to 7 

00:03:23.249 --> 00:03:25.230
 Distribute Wielert 

00:03:25.230 --> 00:03:27.649
 that's almost as many 

00:03:27.649 --> 00:03:30.649
 szo 

00:03:40.669 --> 00:03:43.089
 Skeptics warn 

00:03:43.089 --> 00:03:46.319
 Vennemann described all 

00:03:46.319 --> 00:03:47.680
 How can I find out 

00:03:47.680 --> 00:03:50.569
 if that is more than enough that I can do 

00:03:50.569 --> 00:03:53.759
 But it can be endangered if I have one 

00:03:53.759 --> 00:03:54.759
 society 

00:03:54.759 --> 00:03:56.849
 Wooden spoon for investors 

00:03:56.849 --> 00:03:58.419
 and if this norm is around 

00:03:58.419 --> 00:04:01.069
 forming small bubbles 

00:04:01.069 --> 00:04:03.289
 is the whole 

00:04:03.289 --> 00:04:06.289
 as enough 

00:04:10.089 --> 00:04:13.049
 we are already that the area 

00:04:13.049 --> 00:04:15.109
 1 'used 

00:04:15.109 --> 00:04:18.319
 a good sign 

00:04:18.319 --> 00:04:19.629
 play even better 

00:04:19.629 --> 00:04:21.059
 H 

00:04:21.059 --> 00:04:24.059
 firmly 

00:04:36.370 --> 00:04:37.559
 v 

00:04:37.559 --> 00:04:41.919
 Pfleiderer I'm in default 

00:04:42.809 --> 00:04:44.550
 you did not have to stay up late 

00:04:44.550 --> 00:04:47.960
 and for me this deadline was not extended 

00:04:47.960 --> 00:04:50.539
 read more tonight 

00:04:50.539 --> 00:04:52.629
 so was also from the Stiftung Warentest 

00:04:52.629 --> 00:04:55.669
 threatened in many countries for around 50 years 

00:04:55.669 --> 00:04:58.680
 these are questions 

00:04:58.680 --> 00:05:02.559
 mandatory is not yet unlocked 

00:05:02.559 --> 00:05:04.550
 striking 

00:05:04.550 --> 00:05:06.199
 it is a 2 

00:05:06.199 --> 00:05:10.849
 the Swiss aviation AFPTV spoke 

00:05:10.849 --> 00:05:13.989
 I think that everything is the flight 

00:05:31.999 --> 00:05:35.129
 but now that's where the wild guys are 

00:05:35.129 --> 00:05:38.430
 take and this 

00:05:38.430 --> 00:05:41.180
 in first place 

00:05:41.180 --> 00:05:44.509
 Spohr 

00:05:44.509 --> 00:05:47.509
 Caution can burns 

00:05:51.580 --> 00:05:54.580
 APA rehearsed have also counted 

00:06:02.289 --> 00:06:05.400
 even steam can be painful 

00:06:05.400 --> 00:06:08.400
 only two from the same time 

00:06:09.339 --> 00:06:10.550
 and now 

00:06:10.550 --> 00:06:13.550
 By the way, also sufficient 

00:06:15.710 --> 00:06:18.619
 Castejon 

00:06:18.619 --> 00:06:20.249
 and on the slide 

00:06:20.249 --> 00:06:21.900
 give it all 

00:06:21.900 --> 00:06:23.629
 Birthday once 

00:06:23.629 --> 00:06:29.979
 the Weingut Schloss Ortenberg facebook group little girl 

00:06:29.979 --> 00:06:32.979
 Be careful because the bench could be easy to calculate 

00:06:33.619 --> 00:06:36.619
 So go to Samson's book do not interfere 

00:06:40.629 --> 00:06:42.020
 approximately 

00:06:42.020 --> 00:06:43.300
 currently can 

00:06:43.300 --> 00:06:46.400
 the thing is actually already done 

00:06:46.400 --> 00:06:49.400
 Enjoy your meal 

00:06:51.139 --> 00:06:54.399
