00:02:13.069 --> 00:02:16.420 
the job
perhaps<00:02:13.850> for<00:02:14.240> a<00:02:14.420> while

00:02:16.420 --> 00:02:16.430 
perhaps for a while

00:02:16.430 --> 00:02:20.680 
perhaps for a while
we<00:02:16.849> have<00:02:17.030> to<00:02:17.209> wait<00:02:17.390> for<00:02:17.629> the<00:02:19.120> lever<00:02:20.120> case<00:02:20.390> but<00:02:20.659> I

00:02:20.680 --> 00:02:20.690 
we have to wait for the lever case but I

00:02:20.690 --> 00:02:22.030 
we have to wait for the lever case but I
think<00:02:21.019> I<00:02:21.080> might<00:02:21.230> have<00:02:21.260> to<00:02:21.379> pick<00:02:21.530> that<00:02:21.680> up<00:02:21.739> to

00:02:22.030 --> 00:02:22.040 
think I might have to pick that up to

00:02:22.040 --> 00:02:24.369 
think I might have to pick that up to
really<00:02:22.280> look<00:02:22.459> after<00:02:22.610> my<00:02:22.849> ass<00:02:22.970> to<00:02:23.090> encode<00:02:23.379> 8k

00:02:24.369 --> 00:02:24.379 
really look after my ass to encode 8k

00:02:24.379 --> 00:02:29.130 
really look after my ass to encode 8k
100<00:02:25.780> here<00:02:26.780> is<00:02:26.900> the<00:02:27.310> USB<00:02:28.310> to<00:02:28.580> micro<00:02:28.940> USB

00:02:36.250 --> 00:02:36.260 
charging cable that gets that person to

00:02:36.260 --> 00:02:38.259 
charging cable that gets that person to
come<00:02:36.440> wrapped<00:02:36.680> around<00:02:36.799> it<00:02:37.129> we<00:02:37.700> have<00:02:37.819> some

00:02:38.259 --> 00:02:38.269 
come wrapped around it we have some

00:02:38.269 --> 00:02:49.869 
come wrapped around it we have some
screen<00:02:38.599> protectors<00:02:39.110> which<00:02:39.590> is<00:02:39.709> great<00:02:48.819> this<00:02:49.819> is

00:02:49.869 --> 00:02:49.879 
screen protectors which is great this is

00:02:49.879 --> 00:02:54.880 
screen protectors which is great this is
about<00:02:50.890> mqs<00:02:52.599> mastersound<00:02:53.599> which<00:02:54.440> is<00:02:54.590> obviously

00:02:54.880 --> 00:02:54.890 
about mqs mastersound which is obviously

00:02:54.890 --> 00:02:58.809 
about mqs mastersound which is obviously
a<00:02:54.950> HD<00:02:55.640> tracks<00:02:55.940> or<00:02:56.260> 2496<00:02:57.260> or<00:02:57.680> 24<00:02:58.250> one<00:02:58.430> night<00:02:58.579> so<00:02:58.790> I

00:02:58.809 --> 00:02:58.819 
a HD tracks or 2496 or 24 one night so I

00:02:58.819 --> 00:03:00.819 
a HD tracks or 2496 or 24 one night so I
have<00:02:59.000> a<00:02:59.030> few<00:02:59.299> of<00:02:59.390> them<00:02:59.510> to<00:03:00.109> try<00:03:00.319> out<00:03:00.410> with<00:03:00.680> this

00:03:00.819 --> 00:03:00.829 
have a few of them to try out with this

00:03:00.829 --> 00:03:02.949 
have a few of them to try out with this
I<00:03:01.040> think<00:03:01.250> this<00:03:01.519> comes<00:03:01.849> with<00:03:02.030> a<00:03:02.120> few<00:03:02.329> as<00:03:02.480> well<00:03:02.659> so

00:03:02.949 --> 00:03:02.959 
I think this comes with a few as well so

00:03:02.959 --> 00:03:04.660 
I think this comes with a few as well so
you<00:03:03.049> can<00:03:03.200> really<00:03:03.319> see<00:03:03.530> the<00:03:03.620> quality<00:03:03.920> we<00:03:04.549> have<00:03:04.640> a

00:03:04.660 --> 00:03:04.670 
you can really see the quality we have a

00:03:04.670 --> 00:03:07.599 
you can really see the quality we have a
warranty<00:03:05.090> and<00:03:06.099> that's<00:03:07.099> what<00:03:07.280> we<00:03:07.400> have

00:03:07.599 --> 00:03:07.609 
warranty and that's what we have

00:03:07.609 --> 00:03:10.780 
warranty and that's what we have
included<00:03:08.230> so<00:03:09.230> them<00:03:09.440> self<00:03:10.250> close<00:03:10.459> look<00:03:10.640> at<00:03:10.730> the

00:03:10.780 --> 00:03:10.790 
included so them self close look at the

00:03:10.790 --> 00:03:12.880 
included so them self close look at the
a<00:03:10.849> 100<00:03:11.480> I've<00:03:11.690> said<00:03:11.840> before<00:03:11.870> I<00:03:12.230> have<00:03:12.440> used<00:03:12.739> this

00:03:12.880 --> 00:03:12.890 
a 100 I've said before I have used this

00:03:12.890 --> 00:03:14.229 
a 100 I've said before I have used this
briefly<00:03:13.220> but<00:03:13.430> I'm<00:03:13.549> not<00:03:13.670> going<00:03:13.819> to<00:03:13.879> bring<00:03:14.060> you<00:03:14.209> a

00:03:19.990 --> 00:03:20.000 
and what we have on it so it's a very

00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:21.879 
and what we have on it so it's a very
small<00:03:20.299> device<00:03:20.450> just<00:03:21.319> don't<00:03:21.530> count<00:03:21.709> on<00:03:21.799> the

00:03:21.879 --> 00:03:21.889 
small device just don't count on the

00:03:21.889 --> 00:03:25.990 
small device just don't count on the
back<00:03:22.130> there<00:03:24.340> try<00:03:25.340> cleaning<00:03:25.579> it<00:03:25.669> up<00:03:25.819> a<00:03:25.880> little

00:03:25.990 --> 00:03:26.000 
back there try cleaning it up a little

00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:28.659 
back there try cleaning it up a little
bit<00:03:26.180> so<00:03:26.840> I'm<00:03:27.049> first<00:03:27.500> wear<00:03:27.709> this<00:03:27.829> volume<00:03:28.489> knob

00:03:28.659 --> 00:03:28.669 
bit so I'm first wear this volume knob

00:03:28.669 --> 00:03:30.970 
bit so I'm first wear this volume knob
on<00:03:28.819> the<00:03:28.880> side<00:03:29.150> which<00:03:29.419> feels<00:03:29.989> really<00:03:30.440> nice

00:03:30.970 --> 00:03:30.980 
on the side which feels really nice

00:03:30.980 --> 00:03:33.610 
on the side which feels really nice
the<00:03:31.549> real<00:03:31.790> nice<00:03:31.970> feel<00:03:32.239> I<00:03:32.269> must<00:03:32.480> say<00:03:32.690> to<00:03:32.750> it<00:03:33.049> and

00:03:33.610 --> 00:03:33.620 
the real nice feel I must say to it and

00:03:33.620 --> 00:03:36.490 
the real nice feel I must say to it and
that's<00:03:33.919> the<00:03:34.129> volume<00:03:34.459> knob<00:03:35.290> with<00:03:36.290> enough

00:03:36.490 --> 00:03:36.500 
that's the volume knob with enough

00:03:36.500 --> 00:03:39.849 
that's the volume knob with enough
volume<00:03:37.430> on<00:03:38.030> this<00:03:38.209> side<00:03:38.480> plus<00:03:38.870> minus<00:03:39.440> and<00:03:39.620> pause

00:03:39.849 --> 00:03:39.859 
volume on this side plus minus and pause

00:03:39.859 --> 00:03:41.830 
volume on this side plus minus and pause
play<00:03:40.160> just<00:03:40.340> like<00:03:40.400> a<00:03:40.519> free<00:03:40.730> button<00:03:41.000> remote<00:03:41.239> so

00:03:41.830 --> 00:03:41.840 
play just like a free button remote so

00:03:41.840 --> 00:03:44.289 
play just like a free button remote so
we<00:03:41.900> have<00:03:42.049> the<00:03:42.489> headphone<00:03:43.489> out<00:03:43.639> and<00:03:43.819> the

00:03:44.289 --> 00:03:44.299 
we have the headphone out and the

00:03:44.299 --> 00:03:48.430 
we have the headphone out and the
optical<00:03:45.190> in<00:03:46.190> there<00:03:46.639> and<00:03:46.879> that's<00:03:47.480> the<00:03:47.599> optical

00:03:48.430 --> 00:03:48.440 
optical in there and that's the optical

00:03:48.440 --> 00:03:54.960 
optical in there and that's the optical
out<00:03:48.680> there<00:03:50.650> this<00:03:52.810> will<00:03:53.810> be<00:03:53.840> the<00:03:54.169> power<00:03:54.379> bar

00:03:54.960 --> 00:03:54.970 
out there this will be the power bar

00:03:54.970 --> 00:03:57.909 
out there this will be the power bar
then<00:03:55.970> I'm<00:03:56.180> not<00:03:57.049> sure<00:03:57.260> if<00:03:57.319> is<00:03:57.440> quite<00:03:57.590> in<00:03:57.680> charge

00:03:57.909 --> 00:03:57.919 
then I'm not sure if is quite in charge

00:03:57.919 --> 00:04:01.449 
then I'm not sure if is quite in charge
where<00:03:58.489> the<00:03:58.609> charging<00:03:59.030> charging<00:04:00.190> port<00:04:01.190> there

00:04:01.449 --> 00:04:01.459 
where the charging charging port there

00:04:01.459 --> 00:04:05.949 
where the charging charging port there
agency<00:04:01.879> and<00:04:02.720> this<00:04:02.840> actually<00:04:04.569> can<00:04:05.569> be<00:04:05.720> wielded

00:04:05.949 --> 00:04:05.959 
agency and this actually can be wielded

00:04:05.959 --> 00:04:09.610 
agency and this actually can be wielded
with<00:04:06.139> two<00:04:06.980> micro<00:04:07.669> SD<00:04:08.000> cards<00:04:08.389> so<00:04:08.780> it's<00:04:08.930> 32<00:04:09.349> gig

00:04:09.610 --> 00:04:09.620 
with two micro SD cards so it's 32 gig

00:04:09.620 --> 00:04:11.020 
with two micro SD cards so it's 32 gig
of<00:04:09.829> onboard<00:04:10.250> memory<00:04:10.310> and<00:04:10.609> you<00:04:10.669> can<00:04:10.760> have<00:04:10.849> two

00:04:11.020 --> 00:04:11.030 
of onboard memory and you can have two

00:04:11.030 --> 00:04:13.449 
of onboard memory and you can have two
32<00:04:11.510> gig<00:04:11.750> memory<00:04:12.379> cards<00:04:12.859> and<00:04:12.949> I<00:04:13.040> think<00:04:13.250> there's

00:04:13.449 --> 00:04:13.459 
32 gig memory cards and I think there's

00:04:13.459 --> 00:04:15.460 
32 gig memory cards and I think there's
a<00:04:13.489> reports<00:04:13.819> of<00:04:13.910> 64<00:04:14.419> gig<00:04:14.599> memory<00:04:14.780> cards<00:04:15.139> working

00:04:15.460 --> 00:04:15.470 
a reports of 64 gig memory cards working

00:04:15.470 --> 00:04:17.770 
a reports of 64 gig memory cards working
so<00:04:16.010> if<00:04:16.099> the<00:04:16.190> 64<00:04:16.729> gig<00:04:16.910> working<00:04:17.060> we<00:04:17.599> have<00:04:17.750> a

00:04:17.770 --> 00:04:17.780 
so if the 64 gig working we have a

00:04:17.780 --> 00:04:20.289 
so if the 64 gig working we have a
hundred<00:04:18.349> twenty-eight<00:04:18.799> plus<00:04:18.919> of<00:04:19.099> 32<00:04:19.609> so<00:04:20.209> we

00:04:20.289 --> 00:04:20.299 
hundred twenty-eight plus of 32 so we

00:04:20.299 --> 00:04:23.200 
hundred twenty-eight plus of 32 so we
have<00:04:20.479> that<00:04:20.630> up<00:04:20.810> to<00:04:21.019> them<00:04:21.610> 150<00:04:22.610> gigabytes<00:04:23.030> of

00:04:23.200 --> 00:04:23.210 
have that up to them 150 gigabytes of

00:04:23.210 --> 00:04:25.120 
have that up to them 150 gigabytes of
memory<00:04:23.270> which<00:04:24.020> would<00:04:24.139> be<00:04:24.229> amazing<00:04:24.469> and<00:04:24.800> if<00:04:24.890> not

00:04:25.120 --> 00:04:25.130 
memory which would be amazing and if not
