growing<00:00:10.620> log<00:00:10.920> now<00:00:11.639> these<00:00:11.849> little<00:00:12.120> guys<00:00:12.240> are

00:00:12.740 --> 00:00:12.750 
growing log now these little guys are

00:00:12.750 --> 00:00:15.110 
growing log now these little guys are
basically<00:00:13.590> a<00:00:13.889> hardwood<00:00:14.400> composite<00:00:14.940> log

00:00:15.110 --> 00:00:15.120 
basically a hardwood composite log

00:00:15.120 --> 00:00:18.140 
basically a hardwood composite log
man-made<00:00:15.890> already<00:00:16.890> inoculated<00:00:17.160> with<00:00:17.850> with

our<00:00:18.390> strain<00:00:18.840> of<00:00:19.020> shiitake<00:00:19.310> and<00:00:20.310> ready<00:00:20.490> to<00:00:20.580> go

00:00:20.840 --> 00:00:20.850 
our strain of shiitake and ready to go

00:00:20.850 --> 00:00:24.019 
our strain of shiitake and ready to go
three<00:00:21.720> to<00:00:21.840> four<00:00:22.020> months<00:00:22.320> old<00:00:22.670> when<00:00:23.670> you<00:00:23.789> first

00:00:24.019 --> 00:00:24.029 
three to four months old when you first

00:00:24.029 --> 00:00:26.810 
three to four months old when you first
receive<00:00:24.269> them<00:00:24.920> so<00:00:25.920> they're<00:00:26.099> fully<00:00:26.279> colonized

00:00:26.810 --> 00:00:26.820 
receive them so they're fully colonized

00:00:26.820 --> 00:00:28.279 
receive them so they're fully colonized
really<00:00:27.119> go<00:00:27.269> and<00:00:27.449> you'll<00:00:27.539> see<00:00:27.750> a<00:00:27.779> little<00:00:27.990> bit<00:00:28.140> of

00:00:28.279 --> 00:00:28.289 
really go and you'll see a little bit of

00:00:28.289 --> 00:00:30.679 
really go and you'll see a little bit of
growth<00:00:28.560> perhaps<00:00:29.460> a<00:00:29.699> little<00:00:29.970> bit<00:00:30.090> of<00:00:30.179> premature

00:00:30.679 --> 00:00:30.689 
growth perhaps a little bit of premature

00:00:30.689 --> 00:00:31.310 
growth perhaps a little bit of premature
growth

00:00:31.310 --> 00:00:31.320 
growth

00:00:31.320 --> 00:00:34.880 
growth
underneath<00:00:32.099> the<00:00:32.430> bag<00:00:32.840> here<00:00:33.840> and<00:00:34.320> that's

00:00:34.880 --> 00:00:34.890 
underneath the bag here and that's

00:00:34.890 --> 00:00:37.459 
underneath the bag here and that's
absolutely<00:00:35.070> fine<00:00:35.820> basically<00:00:36.780> all<00:00:37.079> the<00:00:37.230> little

00:00:37.459 --> 00:00:37.469 
absolutely fine basically all the little

00:00:37.469 --> 00:00:39.560 
absolutely fine basically all the little
Prime<00:00:37.710> audience<00:00:38.190> see<00:00:38.700> popping<00:00:39.090> up<00:00:39.180> even<00:00:39.480> the

00:00:39.560 --> 00:00:39.570 
Prime audience see popping up even the

00:00:39.570 --> 00:00:44.209 
Prime audience see popping up even the
smallest<00:00:39.989> of<00:00:40.350> small<00:00:40.500> ones<00:00:41.090> are<00:00:42.710> going<00:00:43.710> to<00:00:43.920> grow

00:00:44.209 --> 00:00:44.219 
smallest of small ones are going to grow

00:00:44.219 --> 00:00:47.209 
smallest of small ones are going to grow
within<00:00:44.550> the<00:00:44.700> next<00:00:45.500> three<00:00:46.500> flushes<00:00:47.039> of

00:00:47.209 --> 00:00:47.219 
within the next three flushes of

00:00:47.219 --> 00:00:48.860 
within the next three flushes of
mushrooms<00:00:47.670> so<00:00:47.789> very<00:00:48.059> simple<00:00:48.480> take<00:00:48.690> some

00:00:48.860 --> 00:00:48.870 
mushrooms so very simple take some

00:00:48.870 --> 00:00:51.439 
mushrooms so very simple take some
scissors<00:00:49.230> we're<00:00:50.039> going<00:00:50.070> to<00:00:50.219> take<00:00:50.940> the<00:00:51.090> end<00:00:51.239> off

00:00:51.439 --> 00:00:51.449 
scissors we're going to take the end off

00:00:51.449 --> 00:01:02.840 
scissors we're going to take the end off
the<00:00:51.629> plastic<00:01:00.920> now<00:01:01.920> it's<00:01:02.100> important<00:01:02.579> with<00:01:02.670> the

00:01:02.840 --> 00:01:02.850 
the plastic now it's important with the

00:01:02.850 --> 00:01:06.920 
the plastic now it's important with the
shiitakes<00:01:03.570> that<00:01:04.500> we<00:01:05.090> expose<00:01:06.090> the<00:01:06.390> entire

00:01:06.920 --> 00:01:06.930 
shiitakes that we expose the entire

00:01:06.930 --> 00:01:28.550 
shiitakes that we expose the entire
substrate<00:01:26.600> so<00:01:27.600> if<00:01:27.659> you<00:01:27.750> have<00:01:27.900> a<00:01:27.930> closer<00:01:28.229> look

00:01:28.550 --> 00:01:28.560 
substrate so if you have a closer look

00:01:28.560 --> 00:01:32.899 
substrate so if you have a closer look
there<00:01:28.770> as<00:01:28.890> a<00:01:28.920> few<00:01:30.439> smaller<00:01:31.439> mature<00:01:32.340> mushrooms

00:01:32.899 --> 00:01:32.909 
there as a few smaller mature mushrooms

00:01:32.909 --> 00:01:35.319 
there as a few smaller mature mushrooms
already<00:01:33.270> forming<00:01:33.780> around<00:01:34.049> our<00:01:34.229> log<00:01:34.500> there<00:01:34.799> so

00:01:35.319 --> 00:01:35.329 
already forming around our log there so

00:01:35.329 --> 00:01:39.260 
already forming around our log there so
plenty<00:01:36.329> of<00:01:36.390> potential<00:01:36.720> for<00:01:37.140> four<00:01:38.270> lovely

00:01:39.260 --> 00:01:39.270 
plenty of potential for four lovely

00:01:39.270 --> 00:01:41.270 
plenty of potential for four lovely
lovely<00:01:39.810> shiitake<00:01:40.439> mushrooms<00:01:40.829> and<00:01:40.920> plenty<00:01:41.250> of

00:01:41.270 --> 00:01:41.280 
lovely shiitake mushrooms and plenty of

00:01:41.280 --> 00:01:45.109 
lovely shiitake mushrooms and plenty of
them<00:01:41.520> what<00:01:42.450> we<00:01:42.570> want<00:01:42.750> to<00:01:42.810> do<00:01:42.930> then<00:01:43.200> is<00:01:43.909> take<00:01:44.909> our

00:01:45.109 --> 00:01:45.119 
them what we want to do then is take our

00:01:45.119 --> 00:01:52.039 
them what we want to do then is take our
log<00:01:49.670> and<00:01:50.670> we're<00:01:50.850> going<00:01:50.970> to<00:01:51.000> pop<00:01:51.149> it<00:01:51.299> into<00:01:51.450> a

00:01:52.039 --> 00:01:52.049 
log and we're going to pop it into a

00:01:52.049 --> 00:01:54.380 
log and we're going to pop it into a
bucket<00:01:52.500> or<00:01:52.590> a<00:01:52.680> barrel<00:01:53.220> of<00:01:53.399> water<00:01:53.820> and<00:01:54.119> what<00:01:54.270> we

00:01:54.380 --> 00:01:54.390 
bucket or a barrel of water and what we

00:01:54.390 --> 00:01:55.910 
bucket or a barrel of water and what we
want<00:01:54.570> to<00:01:54.659> do<00:01:54.780> is<00:01:54.899> we<00:01:55.020> want<00:01:55.200> a<00:01:55.259> fully<00:01:55.500> submerge

00:01:55.910 --> 00:01:55.920 
want to do is we want a fully submerge

00:01:55.920 --> 00:01:58.969 
want to do is we want a fully submerge
it<00:01:56.159> for<00:01:56.850> at<00:01:57.030> least<00:01:57.210> 18<00:01:57.780> hours<00:01:57.960> so<00:01:58.469> this<00:01:58.619> is<00:01:58.799> just

00:01:58.969 --> 00:01:58.979 
it for at least 18 hours so this is just

00:01:58.979 --> 00:02:00.139 
it for at least 18 hours so this is just
going<00:01:59.070> to<00:01:59.130> give<00:01:59.280> it<00:01:59.310> a<00:01:59.399> really<00:01:59.610> good<00:01:59.729> shock

00:02:00.139 --> 00:02:00.149 
going to give it a really good shock

00:02:00.149 --> 00:02:02.630 
going to give it a really good shock
I've<00:02:00.899> get<00:02:01.079> it<00:02:01.170> ready<00:02:01.320> to<00:02:01.380> to<00:02:02.070> sort<00:02:02.219> of<00:02:02.280> spring

00:02:02.630 --> 00:02:02.640 
I've get it ready to to sort of spring

00:02:02.640 --> 00:02:06.190 
I've get it ready to to sort of spring
to<00:02:02.820> life<00:02:02.969> so<00:02:03.479> we'll<00:02:04.380> pop<00:02:04.590> that<00:02:04.649> in<00:02:04.890> the<00:02:05.009> bucket

00:02:06.190 --> 00:02:06.200 
to life so we'll pop that in the bucket

00:02:06.200 --> 00:02:08.779 
to life so we'll pop that in the bucket
do<00:02:07.200> it<00:02:07.439> or<00:02:07.649> roll<00:02:07.799> around<00:02:07.979> want<00:02:08.369> to<00:02:08.459> get<00:02:08.550> it<00:02:08.640> nice

00:02:08.779 --> 00:02:08.789 
do it or roll around want to get it nice

00:02:08.789 --> 00:02:13.699 
do it or roll around want to get it nice
and<00:02:08.819> wet<00:02:10.610> now<00:02:11.610> she<00:02:11.700> will<00:02:11.970> float

00:02:13.699 --> 00:02:13.709 
and wet now she will float

00:02:13.709 --> 00:02:17.190 
and wet now she will float
you<00:02:14.709> might<00:02:14.860> want<00:02:15.040> to<00:02:15.069> come<00:02:15.280> down<00:02:15.310> a<00:02:16.019> couple<00:02:17.019> of

00:02:17.190 --> 00:02:17.200 
you might want to come down a couple of

00:02:17.200 --> 00:02:22.320 
you might want to come down a couple of
times<00:02:19.530> within<00:02:20.530> that<00:02:20.800> 24-hour<00:02:21.370> period<00:02:21.700> and

00:02:22.320 --> 00:02:22.330 
times within that 24-hour period and

00:02:22.330 --> 00:02:27.690 
times within that 24-hour period and
just<00:02:23.019> give<00:02:23.170> it<00:02:23.290> a<00:02:23.349> turn<00:02:26.010> we<00:02:27.010> basically<00:02:27.340> want<00:02:27.610> to

00:02:27.690 --> 00:02:27.700 
just give it a turn we basically want to

00:02:27.700 --> 00:02:30.720 
just give it a turn we basically want to
leave<00:02:27.910> that<00:02:28.090> like<00:02:28.360> that<00:02:29.280> and<00:02:30.280> then<00:02:30.459> we'll<00:02:30.580> just

00:02:30.720 --> 00:02:30.730 
leave that like that and then we'll just

00:02:30.730 --> 00:02:32.369 
leave that like that and then we'll just
give<00:02:30.910> it<00:02:31.000> a<00:02:31.060> chance<00:02:31.299> to<00:02:31.480> really<00:02:31.810> really<00:02:32.110> soak

00:02:32.369 --> 00:02:32.379 
give it a chance to really really soak

00:02:32.379 --> 00:02:35.820 
give it a chance to really really soak
up<00:02:32.590> a<00:02:32.680> lot<00:02:32.830> of<00:02:32.860> water<00:02:33.040> and<00:02:33.310> get<00:02:33.459> me<00:02:33.580> okay

00:02:35.820 --> 00:02:35.830 
up a lot of water and get me okay

00:02:35.830 --> 00:02:37.800 
up a lot of water and get me okay
so<00:02:36.519> now<00:02:36.700> once<00:02:36.940> you've<00:02:37.060> given<00:02:37.180> that<00:02:37.360> around

00:02:37.800 --> 00:02:37.810 
so now once you've given that around

00:02:37.810 --> 00:02:44.430 
so now once you've given that around
about<00:02:38.489> 24<00:02:39.489> hours<00:02:39.730> to<00:02:40.269> to<00:02:41.049> soak<00:02:42.010> up<00:02:43.379> what<00:02:44.379> you

00:02:44.430 --> 00:02:44.440 
about 24 hours to to soak up what you

00:02:44.440 --> 00:02:45.569 
about 24 hours to to soak up what you
want<00:02:44.590> to<00:02:44.680> do<00:02:44.769> is<00:02:44.890> just<00:02:45.040> take<00:02:45.280> the<00:02:45.400> whole

00:02:45.569 --> 00:02:45.579 
want to do is just take the whole

00:02:45.579 --> 00:02:47.400 
want to do is just take the whole
substrate<00:02:46.180> place<00:02:46.900> it<00:02:46.989> on<00:02:47.049> a<00:02:47.110> piece<00:02:47.230> of

00:02:47.400 --> 00:02:47.410 
substrate place it on a piece of

00:02:47.410 --> 00:02:49.949 
substrate place it on a piece of

00:03:04.559 --> 00:03:04.569 
now we want to set up the growing area

00:03:04.569 --> 00:03:06.809 
now we want to set up the growing area
so<00:03:04.930> it's<00:03:05.140> important<00:03:05.620> to<00:03:05.680> contain<00:03:06.190> this<00:03:06.400> area

temperature<00:03:17.799> for<00:03:18.010> them<00:03:18.130> to<00:03:18.280> grow<00:03:18.489> so<00:03:18.910> a

00:03:19.110 --> 00:03:19.120 
temperature for them to grow so a

00:03:19.120 --> 00:03:21.120 
temperature for them to grow so a
centimeter<00:03:19.840> or<00:03:20.049> two<00:03:20.230> of<00:03:20.350> water<00:03:20.620> on<00:03:20.859> the<00:03:21.010> bottom

centimeter or two of water on the bottom

00:03:21.130 --> 00:03:23.009 
centimeter or two of water on the bottom
and<00:03:21.489> then<00:03:21.940> what<00:03:22.030> we<00:03:22.180> want<00:03:22.299> to<00:03:22.420> do<00:03:22.569> is<00:03:22.690> we<00:03:22.810> want

to place our log sitting up off the

00:03:25.209 --> 00:03:29.129 
to place our log sitting up off the
water<00:03:26.880> so<00:03:27.880> what<00:03:28.090> we've<00:03:28.239> got<00:03:28.269> here<00:03:28.480> is<00:03:28.780> it<00:03:28.930> is

00:03:29.129 --> 00:03:29.139 
water so what we've got here is it is

the water at the bottom just going to

00:03:40.780 --> 00:03:42.449 
the water at the bottom just going to
can<00:03:40.959> help<00:03:41.170> contain<00:03:41.560> that<00:03:41.799> humidity<00:03:42.130> in<00:03:42.430> the

00:03:42.449 --> 00:03:42.459 
can help contain that humidity in the

00:03:42.459 --> 00:03:46.170 
can help contain that humidity in the
area<00:03:43.380> what<00:03:44.380> we<00:03:44.530> will<00:03:44.739> do<00:03:44.950> is<00:03:45.250> place<00:03:45.549> a<00:03:45.790> little

00:03:46.170 --> 00:03:46.180 
area what we will do is place a little

00:03:46.180 --> 00:03:52.490 
area what we will do is place a little
bit<00:03:46.299> of<00:03:46.419> plastic<00:03:46.780> over<00:03:48.419> the<00:03:49.419> area<00:03:49.720> and<00:03:49.780> leave<00:03:50.200> a

00:03:55.979 --> 00:03:55.989 
little bit of an air hole there for it

00:03:55.989 --> 00:03:59.309 
little bit of an air hole there for it
to<00:03:56.109> breathe<00:03:56.349> and<00:03:56.919> you<00:03:57.069> can<00:03:57.310> take<00:03:57.959> take<00:03:58.959> off<00:03:59.139> the

00:03:59.309 --> 00:03:59.319 
to breathe and you can take take off the
