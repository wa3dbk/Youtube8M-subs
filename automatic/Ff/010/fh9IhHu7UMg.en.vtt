00:02:41.310 --> 00:02:41.320 
league and I FL say there needs to be a

00:02:41.320 --> 00:02:42.990 
league and I FL say there needs to be a
change<00:02:41.620> in<00:02:41.769> rules<00:02:41.980> or<00:02:42.310> a<00:02:42.340> change<00:02:42.670> in<00:02:42.850> direction

in<00:02:43.360> the<00:02:43.450> code<00:02:43.630> they<00:02:44.140> make<00:02:44.380> that<00:02:44.590> decision<00:02:44.890> and

00:02:45.270 --> 00:02:45.280 
in the code they make that decision and

00:02:45.280 --> 00:02:48.030 
in the code they make that decision and
it<00:02:45.610> happens<00:02:45.940> in<00:02:46.180> rugby<00:02:46.750> union<00:02:46.959> we<00:02:47.230> don't<00:02:47.500> have

it happens in rugby union we don't have

00:02:48.040 --> 00:02:50.039
