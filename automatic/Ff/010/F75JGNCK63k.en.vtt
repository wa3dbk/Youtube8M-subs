00:01:08.840 --> 00:01:08.850 
then the bottom of the jetboil a little

00:01:08.850 --> 00:01:12.740 
then the bottom of the jetboil a little
cup<00:01:09.060> here<00:01:09.270> and<00:01:10.310> it<00:01:11.310> comes<00:01:11.520> off<00:01:11.670> like<00:01:11.850> that<00:01:12.090> and

00:01:12.740 --> 00:01:12.750 
cup here and it comes off like that and

00:01:12.750 --> 00:01:14.570 
cup here and it comes off like that and
there's<00:01:13.229> three<00:01:13.470> measuring<00:01:14.010> increments<00:01:14.520> in

00:01:14.570 --> 00:01:14.580 
there's three measuring increments in

00:01:14.580 --> 00:01:17.060 
there's three measuring increments in
there<00:01:14.760> there's<00:01:15.090> one<00:01:15.330> cup<00:01:15.840> two<00:01:16.619> thirds<00:01:16.890> of<00:01:16.979> a

00:01:17.060 --> 00:01:17.070

cup<00:01:17.100> and<00:01:17.369> a<00:01:17.759> third<00:01:18.000> of<00:01:18.090> a<00:01:18.180> cup<00:01:18.650> so<00:01:19.650> that's

00:01:19.820 --> 00:01:19.830 
cup and a third of a cup so that's

00:01:19.830 --> 00:01:23.420 
cup and a third of a cup so that's
pretty<00:01:20.130> useful<00:01:20.610> so<00:01:21.540> then<00:01:21.720> the<00:01:22.049> cup<00:01:22.290> just<00:01:23.159> comes

00:01:23.420 --> 00:01:23.430 
pretty useful so then the cup just comes

00:01:23.430 --> 00:01:25.760 
pretty useful so then the cup just comes
on<00:01:23.580> top<00:01:23.759> of<00:01:23.939> here<00:01:24.090> like<00:01:24.210> this<00:01:24.479> clicks<00:01:25.350> in<00:01:25.560> and

00:01:25.760 --> 00:01:25.770 
on top of here like this clicks in and

00:01:25.770 --> 00:01:29.149 
on top of here like this clicks in and
it's<00:01:26.400> locked<00:01:26.700> it's<00:01:27.360> not<00:01:27.600> coming<00:01:27.840> off<00:01:28.070> and<00:01:29.070> you

00:01:29.149 --> 00:01:29.159 
it's locked it's not coming off and you

00:01:29.159 --> 00:01:32.300 
it's locked it's not coming off and you
take<00:01:29.340> the<00:01:30.259> stabilizer<00:01:31.259> and<00:01:31.500> it<00:01:31.829> snaps<00:01:32.159> right

00:01:32.300 --> 00:01:32.310 
take the stabilizer and it snaps right

00:01:32.310 --> 00:01:36.800 
take the stabilizer and it snaps right
onto<00:01:32.670> the<00:01:32.820> fuel<00:01:33.180> canister<00:01:33.720> like<00:01:34.560> so<00:01:35.070> and<00:01:35.810> super

00:01:36.800 --> 00:01:36.810 
onto the fuel canister like so and super

00:01:36.810 --> 00:01:40.609 
onto the fuel canister like so and super
stable<00:01:37.020> not<00:01:37.890> going<00:01:38.159> anywhere<00:01:38.960> lid<00:01:39.960> goes<00:01:40.200> on

00:01:40.609 --> 00:01:40.619 
stable not going anywhere lid goes on

00:01:40.619 --> 00:01:43.580 
stable not going anywhere lid goes on
top<00:01:41.119> and<00:01:42.119> on<00:01:42.240> front<00:01:42.540> here<00:01:42.780> we<00:01:43.170> have<00:01:43.320> a<00:01:43.350> little

00:01:43.580 --> 00:01:43.590 
top and on front here we have a little

00:01:43.590 --> 00:01:45.469 
top and on front here we have a little
heat<00:01:43.829> indicator<00:01:44.070> this<00:01:44.460> will<00:01:44.610> light<00:01:44.939> up<00:01:45.090> yellow

00:01:45.469 --> 00:01:45.479 
heat indicator this will light up yellow

00:01:45.479 --> 00:01:47.719 
heat indicator this will light up yellow
with<00:01:45.780> the<00:01:45.899> water<00:01:46.140> inside<00:01:46.590> gets<00:01:47.399> hot<00:01:47.579> enough

00:01:47.719 --> 00:01:47.729 
with the water inside gets hot enough

00:01:47.729 --> 00:01:50.690 
with the water inside gets hot enough
and<00:01:48.229> that's<00:01:49.229> pretty<00:01:49.649> much<00:01:49.860> almost<00:01:50.130> to<00:01:50.399> oil

00:01:50.690 --> 00:01:50.700
