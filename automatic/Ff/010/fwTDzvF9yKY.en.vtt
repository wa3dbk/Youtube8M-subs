00:01:45.979 --> 00:01:48.760 
really hard to hold a I'm not even jail
hold<00:01:46.759> it<00:01:46.939> down<00:01:47.060> but<00:01:47.299> that<00:01:47.509> does<00:01:47.810> and<00:01:48.409> I<00:01:48.649> even

00:01:48.760 --> 00:01:48.770 
hold it down but that does and I even

00:01:48.770 --> 00:01:51.639 
hold it down but that does and I even
tried<00:01:49.189> a<00:01:49.220> pro-style<00:01:50.030> yo<00:01:50.569> and<00:01:50.810> eco<00:01:51.080> styling<00:01:51.470> gel

00:01:51.639 --> 00:01:51.649 
tried a pro-style yo and eco styling gel

00:01:51.649 --> 00:01:54.249 
tried a pro-style yo and eco styling gel
and<00:01:51.920> none<00:01:52.099> of<00:01:52.220> that<00:01:52.250> works<00:01:52.610> and<00:01:52.970> so<00:01:53.780> I<00:01:53.810> stick

00:01:54.249 --> 00:01:54.259 
and none of that works and so I stick

00:01:54.259 --> 00:01:55.889 
and none of that works and so I stick
with<00:01:54.470> that<00:01:54.649> because<00:01:54.860> it<00:01:55.099> works<00:01:55.250> really<00:01:55.429> good

00:01:55.889 --> 00:01:55.899 
with that because it works really good

00:01:55.899 --> 00:01:58.389 
with that because it works really good
so<00:01:56.899> this<00:01:57.229> is<00:01:57.349> pretty<00:01:57.470> much<00:01:57.590> how<00:01:57.679> my<00:01:57.950> hair<00:01:58.159> looks

00:01:58.389 --> 00:01:58.399 
so this is pretty much how my hair looks

00:01:58.399 --> 00:02:02.949 
so this is pretty much how my hair looks
I<00:01:58.640> had<00:01:59.630> the<00:01:59.780> top<00:02:00.020> front<00:02:00.409> part<00:02:01.060> up<00:02:02.060> together<00:02:02.390> in

00:02:02.949 --> 00:02:02.959 
I had the top front part up together in

00:02:02.959 --> 00:02:05.109 
I had the top front part up together in
a<00:02:03.080> rubber<00:02:03.259> band<00:02:03.530> and<00:02:03.830> everything<00:02:04.549> else<00:02:04.970> is

00:02:05.109 --> 00:02:05.119 
a rubber band and everything else is

00:02:05.119 --> 00:02:07.210 
a rubber band and everything else is
just<00:02:05.149> hanging<00:02:05.569> and<00:02:06.560> I<00:02:06.619> think<00:02:06.679> it<00:02:06.890> really<00:02:06.920> looks

00:02:07.210 --> 00:02:07.220 
just hanging and I think it really looks

00:02:07.220 --> 00:02:10.839 
just hanging and I think it really looks
nice<00:02:07.929> and<00:02:08.929> so<00:02:09.229> yeah<00:02:09.769> just<00:02:10.429> want<00:02:10.610> to<00:02:10.670> show<00:02:10.789> you
