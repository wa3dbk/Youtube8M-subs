this time with another Arduino project
this<00:00:02.669> week<00:00:02.939> is<00:00:03.179> a<00:00:03.600> MIDI<00:00:04.410> drum<00:00:05.009> kit<00:00:05.250> interface

00:00:05.840 --> 00:00:05.850 
this week is a MIDI drum kit interface

00:00:05.850 --> 00:00:17.420 
this week is a MIDI drum kit interface
for<00:00:06.629> MIDI<00:00:07.080> sound<00:00:07.350> modules<00:00:07.710> for<00:00:08.639> instance<00:00:16.430> so

00:00:17.420 --> 00:00:17.430 
for MIDI sound modules for instance so

00:00:17.430 --> 00:00:19.880 
for MIDI sound modules for instance so
it<00:00:17.609> is<00:00:17.699> this<00:00:17.850> well<00:00:18.090> these<00:00:18.630> are<00:00:18.930> Paizo<00:00:19.289> buzzer

00:00:19.880 --> 00:00:19.890 
it is this well these are Paizo buzzer

00:00:19.890 --> 00:00:22.790 
it is this well these are Paizo buzzer
elements<00:00:20.930> that<00:00:21.930> particular<00:00:22.109> one<00:00:22.380> was<00:00:22.529> freed

00:00:22.790 --> 00:00:22.800 
elements that particular one was freed

00:00:22.800 --> 00:00:26.540 
elements that particular one was freed
from<00:00:22.980> a<00:00:23.160> RadioShack<00:00:24.320> Paizo<00:00:25.350> about<00:00:26.220> 2<00:00:26.400> bucks

00:00:26.540 --> 00:00:26.550 
from a RadioShack Paizo about 2 bucks

00:00:26.550 --> 00:00:28.519 
from a RadioShack Paizo about 2 bucks
this<00:00:27.330> is<00:00:27.480> the<00:00:27.570> same<00:00:27.750> thing<00:00:27.990> but<00:00:28.260> it's<00:00:28.410> been

00:00:28.519 --> 00:00:28.529 
this is the same thing but it's been

00:00:28.529 --> 00:00:31.820 
this is the same thing but it's been
bonded<00:00:28.830> to<00:00:28.980> a<00:00:29.010> brass<00:00:29.880> plate<00:00:30.300> and<00:00:30.630> then<00:00:31.500> has<00:00:31.800> a

00:00:31.820 --> 00:00:31.830 
bonded to a brass plate and then has a

00:00:31.830 --> 00:00:35.510 
bonded to a brass plate and then has a
old<00:00:32.700> mouse<00:00:32.969> pad<00:00:33.270> attached<00:00:33.570> to<00:00:33.780> it<00:00:33.899> to<00:00:34.520> absorb

00:00:35.510 --> 00:00:35.520 
old mouse pad attached to it to absorb

00:00:35.520 --> 00:00:38.750 
old mouse pad attached to it to absorb
the<00:00:35.640> shock<00:00:36.860> these<00:00:37.860> work<00:00:38.100> pretty<00:00:38.219> good<00:00:38.370> as<00:00:38.550> drum

00:00:38.750 --> 00:00:38.760 
the shock these work pretty good as drum

00:00:38.760 --> 00:00:40.010 
the shock these work pretty good as drum
triggers<00:00:39.030> and<00:00:39.270> they<00:00:39.390> aren't<00:00:39.510> velocity

00:00:40.010 --> 00:00:40.020 
triggers and they aren't velocity

00:00:40.020 --> 00:00:41.810 
triggers and they aren't velocity
sensitive<00:00:40.410> to<00:00:40.530> the<00:00:40.620> heart<00:00:40.800> of<00:00:40.920> youth<00:00:41.010> how<00:00:41.760> do

00:00:41.810 --> 00:00:41.820 
sensitive to the heart of youth how do

00:00:41.820 --> 00:00:44.270 
sensitive to the heart of youth how do
you<00:00:41.940> hit<00:00:42.090> them<00:00:42.239> the<00:00:42.420> louder<00:00:43.410> the<00:00:43.710> sound<00:00:43.739> is<00:00:44.100> and

00:00:44.270 --> 00:00:44.280 
you hit them the louder the sound is and

00:00:44.280 --> 00:00:47.840 
you hit them the louder the sound is and
this<00:00:45.030> this<00:00:45.390> free<00:00:45.750> Paizo<00:00:46.410> is<00:00:46.530> nice<00:00:46.770> but<00:00:47.160> it's<00:00:47.730> a

00:00:47.840 --> 00:00:47.850 
this this free Paizo is nice but it's a

00:00:47.850 --> 00:00:50.720 
this this free Paizo is nice but it's a
little<00:00:48.030> bit<00:00:48.120> out<00:00:48.600> of<00:00:48.660> control<00:00:49.079> so<00:00:49.550> let's<00:00:50.550> make

00:00:50.720 --> 00:00:50.730 
little bit out of control so let's make

00:00:50.730 --> 00:00:56.420 
little bit out of control so let's make
a<00:00:51.079> quick<00:00:52.079> little<00:00:53.270> impromptu<00:00:55.010> drum<00:00:56.010> surface

00:00:56.420 --> 00:00:56.430 
a quick little impromptu drum surface

00:00:56.430 --> 00:01:05.030 
a quick little impromptu drum surface
for<00:00:56.699> it<00:01:01.309> and<00:01:02.309> now<00:01:03.379> you<00:01:04.379> can<00:01:04.500> get<00:01:04.619> anywhere<00:01:04.979> on

00:01:05.030 --> 00:01:05.040 
for it and now you can get anywhere on

00:01:05.040 --> 00:01:11.030 
for it and now you can get anywhere on
the<00:01:05.220> disc<00:01:05.489> and<00:01:06.119> it<00:01:06.240> works<00:01:06.390> and<00:01:06.750> so<00:01:08.960> um<00:01:09.960> this<00:01:10.920> is

00:01:11.030 --> 00:01:11.040 
the disc and it works and so um this is

00:01:11.040 --> 00:01:12.320 
the disc and it works and so um this is
totally<00:01:11.280> standalone<00:01:11.610> units<00:01:12.060> run<00:01:12.180> off<00:01:12.299> a

00:01:12.320 --> 00:01:12.330 
totally standalone units run off a

00:01:12.330 --> 00:01:15.320 
totally standalone units run off a
battery<00:01:12.780> and<00:01:13.490> it<00:01:14.490> works<00:01:14.700> quite<00:01:14.820> well

00:01:15.320 --> 00:01:15.330 
battery and it works quite well

00:01:15.330 --> 00:01:17.960 
battery and it works quite well
for<00:01:15.780> a<00:01:16.140> simple<00:01:16.890> little<00:01:17.070> like<00:01:17.520> one-page

00:01:17.960 --> 00:01:17.970 
for a simple little like one-page

00:01:21.320 --> 00:01:21.330 
Arduino sketch this thing back here is a

00:01:21.330 --> 00:01:24.140 
Arduino sketch this thing back here is a
old<00:01:21.780> MIDI<00:01:22.380> module<00:01:22.799> that<00:01:22.979> I<00:01:23.040> had<00:01:23.280> from<00:01:23.580> long<00:01:24.000> ago

00:01:24.140 --> 00:01:24.150 
old MIDI module that I had from long ago

00:01:24.150 --> 00:01:27.020 
old MIDI module that I had from long ago
it's<00:01:25.020> got<00:01:25.200> built-in<00:01:25.470> drum<00:01:25.680> sounds<00:01:25.979> now<00:01:26.970> you

00:01:27.020 --> 00:01:27.030 
it's got built-in drum sounds now you

00:01:27.030 --> 00:01:30.740 
it's got built-in drum sounds now you
might<00:01:27.299> want<00:01:27.450> to<00:01:27.540> not<00:01:28.320> want<00:01:28.530> to<00:01:28.590> do<00:01:28.920> a<00:01:29.509> drum<00:01:30.509> kit

00:01:30.740 --> 00:01:30.750 
might want to not want to do a drum kit

00:01:30.750 --> 00:01:32.510 
might want to not want to do a drum kit
maybe<00:01:31.020> when<00:01:31.229> do<00:01:31.320> some<00:01:31.470> scary<00:01:31.740> for<00:01:31.920> Halloween

00:01:32.510 --> 00:01:32.520 
maybe when do some scary for Halloween

00:01:32.520 --> 00:01:35.030 
maybe when do some scary for Halloween
well<00:01:33.060> MIDI<00:01:33.420> is<00:01:33.600> just<00:01:34.020> a<00:01:34.200> MIDI<00:01:34.799> note

00:01:35.030 --> 00:01:35.040 
well MIDI is just a MIDI note

00:01:35.040 --> 00:01:36.800 
well MIDI is just a MIDI note
information<00:01:35.220> and<00:01:35.820> you<00:01:35.939> can<00:01:36.060> have<00:01:36.210> a<00:01:36.240> sampler

00:01:36.800 --> 00:01:36.810 
information and you can have a sampler

00:01:36.810 --> 00:01:38.319 
information and you can have a sampler
hooked<00:01:36.960> up<00:01:37.049> on<00:01:37.170> your<00:01:37.290> computer<00:01:37.380> for<00:01:37.890> instance

hooked up on your computer for instance

00:01:38.329 --> 00:01:43.399 
hooked up on your computer for instance
like<00:01:39.560> something<00:01:40.560> like<00:01:40.680> this<00:01:40.710> and<00:01:41.960> then<00:01:42.960> these

00:01:43.399 --> 00:01:43.409 
like something like this and then these

00:01:43.409 --> 00:01:53.240 
like something like this and then these
become<00:01:43.799> scary<00:01:44.280> noises

00:01:53.240 --> 00:01:53.250 

00:01:53.250 --> 00:01:57.240 

so<00:01:54.250> imagine<00:01:55.320> imagine<00:01:56.320> these<00:01:56.620> little<00:01:56.890> sensors
