00:00:00.340 --> 00:00:08.500
 to everyone that we are on Monday day 

00:00:03.489 --> 00:00:10.630
 1 mind made Monday July 20 in 

00:00:08.500 --> 00:00:12.490
 are not good days anymore for 

00:00:10.630 --> 00:00:13.980
 you yes I hope because you already know that 

00:00:12.490 --> 00:00:15.760
 I give you the good morning always 

00:00:13.980 --> 00:00:17.289
 regardless of when I recorded 

00:00:15.760 --> 00:00:20.260
 because I always put what he asked for 

00:00:17.289 --> 00:00:22.960
 tomorrow but only at almost 6 in the morning 

00:00:20.260 --> 00:00:24.730
 late and it's Monday and I did not plan to record the 

00:00:22.960 --> 00:00:27.010
 Today's video blog is that as 

00:00:24.730 --> 00:00:29.830
 he always recorded on Fridays Saturdays and 

00:00:27.010 --> 00:00:31.750
 Sundays when it arrives on Monday I'm 

00:00:29.830 --> 00:00:34.270
 as a bit anxious not to record and to 

00:00:31.750 --> 00:00:36.550
 still share and I use snapshot 

00:00:34.270 --> 00:00:38.710
 ok to calm my mission to record and 

00:00:36.550 --> 00:00:40.989
 if you do not follow me I 'm bad dot youtube 

00:00:38.710 --> 00:00:43.660
 so there you have me but still good 

00:00:40.989 --> 00:00:45.700
 since I 'm here in a little bit dried with 

00:00:43.660 --> 00:00:48.100
 my computer because I wanted to talk 

00:00:45.700 --> 00:00:50.770
 with you you know why me magic 

00:00:48.100 --> 00:00:53.440
 trackpad that is this thing here that is 

00:00:50.770 --> 00:00:55.360
 what I use of mouse is worth for 

00:00:53.440 --> 00:00:57.660
 my computer to my imac computer has been 

00:00:55.360 --> 00:01:00.940
 suddenly gone or gone crazy 

00:00:57.660 --> 00:01:03.660
 select only all the things that there are 

00:01:00.940 --> 00:01:06.690
 on my computer web pages 

00:01:03.660 --> 00:01:09.450
 in applications you know how he does not 

00:01:06.690 --> 00:01:11.310
 I leave you do not let all elections be 

00:01:09.450 --> 00:01:13.590
 those selected is like chaos 

00:01:11.310 --> 00:01:15.450
 then everything drags everything moves 

00:01:13.590 --> 00:01:17.250
 and I'm getting black you know me 

00:01:15.450 --> 00:01:19.290
 I'm putting all this good black 

00:01:17.250 --> 00:01:20.970
 note that restarting the computer that 

00:01:19.290 --> 00:01:22.560
 I restarted the trackpad because it goes 

00:01:20.970 --> 00:01:24.900
 bluetooth then I have it off of 

00:01:22.560 --> 00:01:28.170
 back understand the same the computer and 

00:01:24.900 --> 00:01:30.000
 now it is not so chaotic because the 

00:01:28.170 --> 00:01:32.160
 select everything in plan madness but 

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:34.020
 he's still doing strange fuss 

00:01:32.160 --> 00:01:36.240
 as if I had a life of my own, huari mom 

00:01:34.020 --> 00:01:37.410
 I'd say this is the bad milk of 

00:01:36.240 --> 00:01:39.450
 inanimate objects 

00:01:37.410 --> 00:01:42.270
 the fact is that I'm trying to edit 

00:01:39.450 --> 00:01:44.640
 a miniature photo for the video that I'm going 

00:01:42.270 --> 00:01:46.380
 to go up tomorrow and leave it ready and 

00:01:44.640 --> 00:01:48.090
 I usually do it with photoshop but 

00:01:46.380 --> 00:01:50.700
 is that he was going crazy so 

00:01:48.090 --> 00:01:52.289
 I'm using the deep tic app 

00:01:50.700 --> 00:01:54.210
 that I also have it on my mobile at all 

00:01:52.289 --> 00:01:57.300
 this you can use it that is for 

00:01:54.210 --> 00:01:59.520
 make mosaics and nothing and you see the 

00:01:57.300 --> 00:02:02.490
 little clock while circling that has not 

00:01:59.520 --> 00:02:04.380
 touched nothing sing the cancer you see is that 

00:02:02.490 --> 00:02:05.970
 it goes crazy so nothing seems that 

00:02:04.380 --> 00:02:09.390
 it's better for chairs of yours 

00:02:05.970 --> 00:02:11.340
 and nothing will I see if I can avoid this 

00:02:09.390 --> 00:02:13.350
 a way to make it look and nice 

00:02:11.340 --> 00:02:15.330
 for all of you because it's a video 

00:02:13.350 --> 00:02:17.850
 of a summer outfits book look 

00:02:15.330 --> 00:02:20.850
 that has been done with a lot of love in it 

00:02:17.850 --> 00:02:22.310
 you have heat you can not with your soul and if 

00:02:20.850 --> 00:02:28.170
 you are here with the air conditioning 

00:02:22.310 --> 00:02:32.610
 how is she so beautiful and so black and you and me 

00:02:28.170 --> 00:02:34.760
 as I'm leaving, I'll repeat it like this today 

00:02:32.610 --> 00:02:38.720
 give me a kiss kiss your mother 

00:02:34.760 --> 00:02:38.720
 to kiss mother 

00:02:39.900 --> 00:02:46.049
 I burn myself I burn this is the time in 

00:02:44.519 --> 00:02:47.909
 the one that I have to wait for the car 

00:02:46.049 --> 00:02:50.459
 cool down a bit before leaving 

00:02:47.909 --> 00:02:53.549
 done to the belt burns my skin 

00:02:50.459 --> 00:02:56.099
 that is, this is the bile and the air 

00:02:53.549 --> 00:02:58.580
 conditioning working to cool 

00:02:56.099 --> 00:03:02.840
 whole car because it is now 

00:02:58.580 --> 00:03:05.630
 in case he had told me that 

00:03:02.840 --> 00:03:09.140
 we were to run but it is that with this 

00:03:05.630 --> 00:03:11.780
 heat of cracking because it's that you put on 

00:03:09.140 --> 00:03:12.740
 run at 9 o'clock at night or 

00:03:11.780 --> 00:03:15.770
 you are lost 

00:03:12.740 --> 00:03:18.170
 you die from sudden dehydration 

00:03:15.770 --> 00:03:20.870
 instant moment you know it can not be 

00:03:18.170 --> 00:03:22.790
 So, I said that just like other 

00:03:20.870 --> 00:03:25.070
 day will be birds and the time will calm down a little 

00:03:22.790 --> 00:03:27.140
 of heat or I do not know why this is 

00:03:25.070 --> 00:03:29.180
 unbearable or at least not a 

00:03:27.140 --> 00:03:31.870
 day they are talking but I do not like that 

00:03:29.180 --> 00:03:31.870
 I can run 

00:03:34.520 --> 00:03:43.600
 sit down 7 x 7 I'm going to throw the ball 

00:03:40.250 --> 00:03:43.600
 1 2 

00:03:43.690 --> 00:03:46.530
 the beautiful 

00:03:46.970 --> 00:03:50.170
 now we are going to get 

00:03:53.270 --> 00:03:56.170
 to the other 

00:03:58.270 --> 00:04:05.709
 Y 

00:04:01.150 --> 00:04:08.900

00:04:05.709 --> 00:04:13.340
 as we continue well then come from 

00:04:08.900 --> 00:04:15.290
 Dona Esther's aura flower house and everything 

00:04:13.340 --> 00:04:17.600
 correct and we have updated 

00:04:15.290 --> 00:04:20.090
 of rigor and now because nothing I find 

00:04:17.600 --> 00:04:21.739
 in front of my computer 

00:04:20.090 --> 00:04:23.800
 and answer some comments like that to 

00:04:21.739 --> 00:04:27.800
 last minute and now I'm getting ready to 

00:04:23.800 --> 00:04:30.290
 eat what I had left over from yesterday's sushi 

00:04:27.800 --> 00:04:32.360
 who does not teach it on the video blog because 

00:04:30.290 --> 00:04:35.450
 look at me it happened to me if he is writing you 

00:04:32.360 --> 00:04:39.080
 to all this good because I teach it I have 

00:04:35.450 --> 00:04:41.660
 over these four rolls here and 

00:04:39.080 --> 00:04:44.419
 then I have here a little bit of rice with 

00:04:41.660 --> 00:04:46.310
 Chinese mushrooms of this prospect to the 

00:04:44.419 --> 00:04:48.650
 hell if there is a little bit 

00:04:46.310 --> 00:04:50.450
 of everything and then I have here in the other 

00:04:48.650 --> 00:04:52.010
 part 

00:04:50.450 --> 00:04:53.690
 a glass of gazpacho you already know that 

00:04:52.010 --> 00:04:57.890
 love it and I'm going to eat it with some 

00:04:53.690 --> 00:04:58.580
 beaks and beaks call it in other 

00:04:57.890 --> 00:05:01.190
 parts of Spain 

00:04:58.580 --> 00:05:02.810
 these wholemeal rolls that are 

00:05:01.190 --> 00:05:06.500
 very rich and so it becomes or the 

00:05:02.810 --> 00:05:08.150
 Gazpacho in a crispy cold soup 

00:05:06.500 --> 00:05:10.160
 at Esther's house and has taken advantage of 

00:05:08.150 --> 00:05:12.500
 paint my nails because you know that 

00:05:10.160 --> 00:05:14.240
 I only had the base lately 

00:05:12.500 --> 00:05:17.000
 hardener to not hardening lie ah 

00:05:14.240 --> 00:05:19.520
 does not speak properly the base has 

00:05:17.000 --> 00:05:21.800
 now enlisted instantly to the listing 

00:05:19.520 --> 00:05:24.050
 now this base and I bought new in 

00:05:21.800 --> 00:05:25.880
 kiko and my nails were very 

00:05:24.050 --> 00:05:28.220
 natural and wanted to release the new 

00:05:25.880 --> 00:05:30.020
 color of enamel that I also bought myself 

00:05:28.220 --> 00:05:34.040
 the same day that I bought the base that 

00:05:30.020 --> 00:05:36.020
 is this beige pink tone that at least 

00:05:34.040 --> 00:05:38.210
 in the little boat it seemed much more 

00:05:36.020 --> 00:05:40.970
 beautiful I will remember the tone is 0-2 

00:05:38.210 --> 00:05:42.200
 of this new range of glazes and when 

00:05:40.970 --> 00:05:44.030
 I have put on my nails the truth is 

00:05:42.200 --> 00:05:46.130
 that is pretty much more more pink 

00:05:44.030 --> 00:05:50.210
 cake is worth here what you have is pretty 

00:05:46.130 --> 00:05:51.980
 more female cookie and it was not thought that 

00:05:50.210 --> 00:05:53.540
 it was going to be a little bit more beige but 

00:05:51.980 --> 00:05:56.150
 good still it does not bother me 

00:05:53.540 --> 00:05:57.590
 truth is that the coverage is pretty 

00:05:56.150 --> 00:05:59.300
 good and above all what has 

00:05:57.590 --> 00:06:02.629
 surprised is 

00:05:59.300 --> 00:06:05.419
 the rapids that are drying so what 

00:06:02.629 --> 00:06:08.750
 I will try another day without having any basis 

00:06:05.419 --> 00:06:11.240
 in the nails to see how the 

00:06:08.750 --> 00:06:13.280
 coverage and nothing and I will continue telling you 

00:06:11.240 --> 00:06:14.750
 so that what you leave me in comments 

00:06:13.280 --> 00:06:16.430
