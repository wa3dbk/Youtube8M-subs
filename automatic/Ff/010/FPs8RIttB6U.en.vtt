00:01:03.860 --> 00:01:03.870 
let's look at the rhythmic count for

00:01:03.870 --> 00:01:11.440 
let's look at the rhythmic count for
this<00:01:03.989> now<00:01:04.199> so<00:01:04.500> we're<00:01:04.680> looking<00:01:04.980> at<00:01:05.100> 1<00:01:05.760> &amp;<00:01:06.470> 2<00:01:07.470> &amp;<00:01:08.100> 3<00:01:08.900> 4

this now so we're looking at 1 &amp; 2 &amp; 3 4
1<00:01:12.450> 2<00:01:14.450> 3<00:01:16.160> 4<00:01:18.140> you<00:01:21.020> could<00:01:22.020> change<00:01:22.230> the<00:01:22.440> rhythm<00:01:22.590> up

00:01:22.790 --> 00:01:22.800 
1 2 3 4 you could change the rhythm up

00:01:22.800 --> 00:01:29.720 
1 2 3 4 you could change the rhythm up
if<00:01:22.980> you<00:01:23.070> want<00:01:27.410> doesn't<00:01:28.410> really<00:01:28.710> matter<00:01:28.980> what

00:01:29.720 --> 00:01:29.730 
if you want doesn't really matter what

00:01:29.730 --> 00:01:32.080 
if you want doesn't really matter what
the<00:01:29.880> big<00:01:30.060> deal<00:01:30.240> is<00:01:30.480> with<00:01:30.660> this<00:01:30.810> one<00:01:30.990> is<00:01:31.140> they're

00:01:32.080 --> 00:01:32.090 
the big deal is with this one is they're

00:01:32.090 --> 00:01:37.210 
the big deal is with this one is they're
not<00:01:33.090> going<00:01:34.160> and<00:01:35.160> using<00:01:35.430> append<00:01:35.850> really

00:01:37.210 --> 00:01:37.220 
not going and using append really

00:01:37.220 --> 00:01:41.139 
not going and using append really
just<00:01:37.490> doesn't<00:01:37.880> sound<00:01:38.090> the<00:01:38.180> same<00:01:38.390> so<00:01:40.119> make<00:01:41.119> sure

00:01:41.139 --> 00:01:41.149 
just doesn't sound the same so make sure

00:01:41.149 --> 00:01:48.520 
just doesn't sound the same so make sure
you're<00:01:41.390> getting<00:01:41.450> banned<00:01:45.430> now<00:01:46.430> the<00:01:46.490> slide<00:01:47.530> you

00:01:48.520 --> 00:01:48.530 
you're getting banned now the slide you

00:01:48.530 --> 00:01:49.690 
you're getting banned now the slide you
really<00:01:48.799> want<00:01:48.950> to<00:01:49.009> make<00:01:49.159> sure<00:01:49.189> that's<00:01:49.520> an

00:01:49.690 --> 00:01:49.700 
really want to make sure that's an

00:01:49.700 --> 00:01:51.819 
really want to make sure that's an
accurate<00:01:50.090> straight<00:01:50.630> to<00:01:50.810> the<00:01:50.930> tenth<00:01:51.200> fret

00:01:51.819 --> 00:01:51.829 
accurate straight to the tenth fret

00:01:51.829 --> 00:01:54.639 
accurate straight to the tenth fret
slide<00:01:52.280> because<00:01:52.490> if<00:01:52.670> you<00:01:52.759> kind<00:01:52.939> of<00:01:52.970> go<00:01:53.350> it<00:01:54.350> never

00:01:54.639 --> 00:01:54.649 
slide because if you kind of go it never

00:01:54.649 --> 00:01:57.070 
slide because if you kind of go it never
sounds<00:01:55.100> right<00:01:55.280> so<00:01:55.520> the<00:01:55.670> trick<00:01:55.909> is<00:01:55.970> to<00:01:56.240> look<00:01:56.810> at

00:01:57.070 --> 00:01:57.080 
sounds right so the trick is to look at

00:01:57.080 --> 00:01:59.130 
sounds right so the trick is to look at
that<00:01:57.320> point<00:01:57.649> so<00:01:57.860> when<00:01:58.009> you're<00:01:58.130> here

00:01:59.130 --> 00:01:59.140 
that point so when you're here

00:01:59.140 --> 00:02:02.109 
that point so when you're here
now<00:02:00.140> I'm<00:02:00.439> looking<00:02:00.770> on<00:02:00.860> the<00:02:00.950> tenth<00:02:01.159> fret<00:02:01.369> so

00:02:02.109 --> 00:02:02.119 
now I'm looking on the tenth fret so

00:02:02.119 --> 00:02:05.050 
now I'm looking on the tenth fret so
when<00:02:02.270> my<00:02:02.390> finger<00:02:02.720> slides<00:02:02.990> there<00:02:03.289> I<00:02:03.729> can<00:02:04.729> slide

00:02:05.050 --> 00:02:05.060 
when my finger slides there I can slide

00:02:05.060 --> 00:02:06.760 
when my finger slides there I can slide
straight<00:02:05.450> to<00:02:05.750> it<00:02:05.869> if<00:02:05.960> you<00:02:06.080> follow<00:02:06.380> your<00:02:06.619> finger

00:02:06.760 --> 00:02:06.770 
straight to it if you follow your finger

00:02:06.770 --> 00:02:08.499 
straight to it if you follow your finger
it's<00:02:07.070> easy<00:02:07.220> to<00:02:07.429> overshoot<00:02:07.939> and<00:02:08.060> have<00:02:08.179> to<00:02:08.300> come

00:02:08.499 --> 00:02:08.509 
it's easy to overshoot and have to come

00:02:08.509 --> 00:02:10.289 
it's easy to overshoot and have to come
back<00:02:08.660> or<00:02:08.899> kind<00:02:09.229> of<00:02:09.380> stop<00:02:09.649> early<00:02:09.950> you<00:02:10.009> wanna

00:02:10.289 --> 00:02:10.299 
back or kind of stop early you wanna

00:02:10.299 --> 00:02:13.180 
back or kind of stop early you wanna
look<00:02:11.299> exactly<00:02:11.900> at<00:02:12.200> the<00:02:12.319> point<00:02:12.530> where<00:02:12.799> you<00:02:12.950> want

00:02:13.180 --> 00:02:13.190 
look exactly at the point where you want

00:02:13.190 --> 00:02:17.080 
look exactly at the point where you want
your<00:02:13.310> finger<00:02:13.610> to<00:02:13.670> go<00:02:15.220> and<00:02:16.220> practice<00:02:16.850> just

00:02:17.080 --> 00:02:17.090 
your finger to go and practice just

00:02:17.090 --> 00:02:18.880 
your finger to go and practice just
sliding<00:02:17.780> to<00:02:17.900> the<00:02:18.019> point<00:02:18.260> that<00:02:18.380> you're<00:02:18.560> looking

00:02:18.880 --> 00:02:18.890 
sliding to the point that you're looking

00:02:18.890 --> 00:02:21.580 
sliding to the point that you're looking
at<00:02:19.040> there<00:02:19.870> and<00:02:20.870> then<00:02:21.019> you<00:02:21.110> want<00:02:21.260> to<00:02:21.319> get<00:02:21.410> some

00:02:21.580 --> 00:02:21.590 
at there and then you want to get some

00:02:21.590 --> 00:02:28.479 
at there and then you want to get some
vibrato<00:02:21.739> on<00:02:22.160> it<00:02:27.010> it's<00:02:28.010> definitely<00:02:28.400> worth

00:02:28.479 --> 00:02:28.489 
vibrato on it it's definitely worth

00:02:28.489 --> 00:02:30.070 
vibrato on it it's definitely worth
practicing<00:02:28.760> that<00:02:29.239> just<00:02:29.420> look<00:02:29.600> at<00:02:29.720> this<00:02:29.810> part

00:02:30.070 --> 00:02:30.080 
practicing that just look at this part

00:02:30.080 --> 00:02:38.770 
practicing that just look at this part
slide<00:02:30.470> and<00:02:31.190> then<00:02:31.310> get<00:02:31.459> some<00:02:31.640> vibrato<00:02:37.630> see<00:02:38.630> that

00:02:38.770 --> 00:02:38.780 
slide and then get some vibrato see that

00:02:38.780 --> 00:02:40.360 
slide and then get some vibrato see that
time<00:02:38.959> I<00:02:38.989> dragged<00:02:39.410> a<00:02:39.590> little<00:02:39.799> bit<00:02:39.920> just<00:02:40.130> at<00:02:40.250> the

00:02:40.360 --> 00:02:40.370 
time I dragged a little bit just at the

00:02:40.370 --> 00:02:44.080 
time I dragged a little bit just at the
end<00:02:42.220> kind<00:02:43.220> of<00:02:43.340> did<00:02:43.459> that<00:02:43.609> a<00:02:43.640> little<00:02:43.790> bit<00:02:43.970> it

00:02:44.080 --> 00:02:44.090 
end kind of did that a little bit it

00:02:44.090 --> 00:02:47.009 
end kind of did that a little bit it
doesn't<00:02:44.239> sound<00:02:44.630> right<00:02:44.750> you<00:02:44.900> got<00:02:45.049> to<00:02:45.170> get<00:02:45.290> that

00:02:47.009 --> 00:02:47.019 
doesn't sound right you got to get that

00:02:47.019 --> 00:02:55.430 
doesn't sound right you got to get that
there<00:02:48.019> again<00:02:48.230> that<00:02:48.440> was<00:02:48.560> another<00:02:48.590> draggy<00:02:49.160> one

00:02:55.430 --> 00:02:55.440 

00:02:55.440 --> 00:02:57.600 

seems<00:02:56.440> like<00:02:56.620> I'm<00:02:56.800> doing<00:02:57.069> the<00:02:57.160> picking<00:02:57.459> for

00:02:57.600 --> 00:02:57.610 
seems like I'm doing the picking for

00:02:57.610 --> 00:02:59.100 
seems like I'm doing the picking for
this<00:02:57.730> all<00:02:57.910> different<00:02:58.300> ways<00:02:58.390> sometimes<00:02:58.690> it's

00:02:59.100 --> 00:02:59.110 
this all different ways sometimes it's

00:02:59.110 --> 00:03:08.309 
this all different ways sometimes it's
all<00:02:59.260> down<00:03:01.890> sometimes<00:03:02.890> it's<00:03:03.190> down<00:03:07.319> usually

00:03:08.309 --> 00:03:08.319 
all down sometimes it's down usually

00:03:08.319 --> 00:03:13.110 
all down sometimes it's down usually
using<00:03:08.770> it<00:03:08.890> down<00:03:09.069> for<00:03:09.280> the<00:03:09.370> slide<00:03:11.850> but<00:03:12.850> all<00:03:13.000> the

00:03:13.110 --> 00:03:13.120 
using it down for the slide but all the

00:03:13.120 --> 00:03:14.610 
using it down for the slide but all the
rest<00:03:13.300> I'm<00:03:13.510> changing<00:03:13.900> it<00:03:13.989> up<00:03:14.110> so<00:03:14.230> I<00:03:14.290> don't<00:03:14.380> think

00:03:14.610 --> 00:03:14.620 
rest I'm changing it up so I don't think

00:03:14.620 --> 00:03:16.110 
rest I'm changing it up so I don't think
it<00:03:14.709> really<00:03:14.920> matters<00:03:15.130> what<00:03:15.760> picking

00:03:16.110 --> 00:03:16.120 
it really matters what picking

00:03:16.120 --> 00:03:17.610 
it really matters what picking
directions<00:03:16.569> you<00:03:16.690> want<00:03:16.870> to<00:03:16.930> use<00:03:17.080> on<00:03:17.260> this<00:03:17.380> lick

00:03:17.610 --> 00:03:17.620 
directions you want to use on this lick

00:03:17.620 --> 00:03:19.710 
directions you want to use on this lick
so<00:03:18.220> again<00:03:18.520> with<00:03:18.700> this<00:03:18.790> kind<00:03:19.090> of<00:03:19.180> lick<00:03:19.390> it's

00:03:19.710 --> 00:03:19.720 
so again with this kind of lick it's

00:03:19.720 --> 00:03:22.080 
so again with this kind of lick it's
simple<00:03:20.140> on<00:03:20.380> paper<00:03:20.440> piece<00:03:21.400> of<00:03:21.580> cake<00:03:21.730> to<00:03:21.880> play

00:03:22.080 --> 00:03:22.090 
simple on paper piece of cake to play

00:03:22.090 --> 00:03:23.640 
simple on paper piece of cake to play
but<00:03:22.510> it's<00:03:22.630> those<00:03:22.780> really<00:03:23.140> subtle<00:03:23.530> little

00:03:23.640 --> 00:03:23.650 
but it's those really subtle little

00:03:23.650 --> 00:03:25.350 
but it's those really subtle little
elements<00:03:24.099> getting<00:03:24.400> the<00:03:24.519> slide<00:03:24.790> right<00:03:25.090> getting

00:03:25.350 --> 00:03:25.360 
elements getting the slide right getting

00:03:25.360 --> 00:03:27.840 
elements getting the slide right getting
a<00:03:25.450> nice<00:03:25.660> vibrato<00:03:25.900> and<00:03:26.440> vibrato<00:03:26.769> similar<00:03:27.700> to

00:03:27.840 --> 00:03:27.850 
a nice vibrato and vibrato similar to

00:03:27.850 --> 00:03:29.400 
a nice vibrato and vibrato similar to
Albert<00:03:28.209> Kings<00:03:28.480> is<00:03:28.690> what<00:03:28.840> you're<00:03:28.959> looking<00:03:29.200> for
