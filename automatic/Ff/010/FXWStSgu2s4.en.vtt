yen<00:01:10.590> and<00:01:11.580> usually<00:01:12.150> uh<00:01:12.770> which<00:01:13.770> ends<00:01:14.070> up

00:01:14.149 --> 00:01:14.159 
yen and usually uh which ends up

00:01:14.159 --> 00:01:17.749 
yen and usually uh which ends up
converting<00:01:14.700> to<00:01:15.090> around<00:01:15.650> $35<00:01:16.650> in<00:01:16.979> terms<00:01:17.610> of

00:01:17.749 --> 00:01:17.759 
converting to around $35 in terms of

00:01:17.759 --> 00:01:19.219 
converting to around $35 in terms of
like<00:01:17.909> you<00:01:18.030> know<00:01:18.060> us<00:01:18.509> money<00:01:18.750> and<00:01:18.840> stuff<00:01:19.020> like

like you know us money and stuff like

00:01:19.229 --> 00:01:20.719 
like you know us money and stuff like
that<00:01:19.290> pretty<00:01:19.860> much<00:01:20.130> to<00:01:20.310> figure<00:01:20.520> out<00:01:20.610> like

00:01:20.719 --> 00:01:20.729 
that pretty much to figure out like

00:01:20.729 --> 00:01:23.090 
that pretty much to figure out like
japanese<00:01:21.180> yen<00:01:21.420> all<00:01:21.630> you<00:01:21.750> got<00:01:21.869> to<00:01:21.900> do<00:01:22.140> is<00:01:22.350> like

00:01:23.090 --> 00:01:23.100 
japanese yen all you got to do is like

00:01:23.100 --> 00:01:25.010 
japanese yen all you got to do is like
move<00:01:23.460> the<00:01:23.610> decimal<00:01:23.820> over<00:01:24.030> two<00:01:24.390> places<00:01:24.659> and

00:01:25.010 --> 00:01:25.020 
move the decimal over two places and

00:01:25.020 --> 00:01:27.560 
move the decimal over two places and
there<00:01:25.140> you<00:01:25.229> go<00:01:25.259> it's<00:01:25.619> pretty<00:01:25.680> close<00:01:26.430> um<00:01:26.790> but

00:01:27.560 --> 00:01:27.570 
there you go it's pretty close um but

00:01:27.570 --> 00:01:32.749 
there you go it's pretty close um but
yeah<00:01:28.229> so<00:01:28.500> um<00:01:29.720> anyways<00:01:30.720> uh<00:01:31.310> so<00:01:32.310> yeah<00:01:32.579> I<00:01:32.610> think

00:01:32.749 --> 00:01:32.759 
yeah so um anyways uh so yeah I think

00:01:32.759 --> 00:01:35.120

before<00:03:14.359> but<00:03:14.540> pretty<00:03:15.349> cool<00:03:16.010> so<00:03:16.370> we'll<00:03:17.359> figure

00:03:17.530 --> 00:03:17.540 
before but pretty cool so we'll figure
