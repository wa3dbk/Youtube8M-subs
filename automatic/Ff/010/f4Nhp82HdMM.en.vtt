00:00:20.540 --> 00:00:20.550 
top you're going to see a tuning so

00:00:20.550 --> 00:00:22.780 
top you're going to see a tuning so
right<00:00:20.880> now<00:00:20.910> by<00:00:21.360> default<00:00:21.540> this<00:00:22.020> is<00:00:22.080> set<00:00:22.260> to

00:00:22.780 --> 00:00:22.790 
right now by default this is set to

00:00:22.790 --> 00:00:24.950 
right now by default this is set to
standard<00:00:23.790> tuning<00:00:24.000> but<00:00:24.300> you<00:00:24.450> can<00:00:24.600> actually

00:00:24.950 --> 00:00:24.960 
standard tuning but you can actually

00:00:24.960 --> 00:00:28.100 
standard tuning but you can actually
choose<00:00:25.320> from<00:00:26.300> some<00:00:27.300> different<00:00:27.630> alternate

00:00:28.100 --> 00:00:28.110 
choose from some different alternate

00:00:28.110 --> 00:00:31.569 
choose from some different alternate
tunings<00:00:28.290> you<00:00:28.980> know<00:00:29.130> drop<00:00:29.400> D<00:00:29.670> or<00:00:30.030> double<00:00:30.450> drop<00:00:30.660> d

00:00:31.569 --> 00:00:31.579 
tunings you know drop D or double drop d

00:00:31.579 --> 00:00:34.280 
tunings you know drop D or double drop d
but<00:00:32.579> for<00:00:33.510> night<00:00:33.660> right<00:00:33.840> now<00:00:33.960> I'm<00:00:34.110> just<00:00:34.170> going

00:00:34.280 --> 00:00:34.290 
but for night right now I'm just going

00:00:34.290 --> 00:00:36.410 
but for night right now I'm just going
to<00:00:34.440> keep<00:00:34.560> that<00:00:34.740> in<00:00:34.980> standard<00:00:35.580> tuning<00:00:35.610> then

00:00:36.410 --> 00:00:36.420 
to keep that in standard tuning then

00:00:36.420 --> 00:00:41.569 
to keep that in standard tuning then
also<00:00:36.600> at<00:00:36.780> the<00:00:36.870> top<00:00:38.570> for<00:00:39.570> the<00:00:40.190> different<00:00:41.190> scales

00:00:41.569 --> 00:00:41.579 
also at the top for the different scales

00:00:41.579 --> 00:00:44.180 
also at the top for the different scales
you're<00:00:42.090> going<00:00:42.210> to<00:00:42.270> have<00:00:42.420> the<00:00:42.630> option<00:00:42.840> to<00:00:43.470> show

00:00:44.180 --> 00:00:44.190 
you're going to have the option to show

00:00:44.190 --> 00:00:46.940 
you're going to have the option to show
exactly<00:00:44.670> what<00:00:45.360> notes<00:00:45.720> something<00:00:46.140> is<00:00:46.320> by<00:00:46.560> name

00:00:46.940 --> 00:00:46.950 
exactly what notes something is by name

00:00:46.950 --> 00:00:51.860 
exactly what notes something is by name
the<00:00:48.380> intervals<00:00:49.380> which<00:00:50.130> is<00:00:50.430> how<00:00:51.360> the<00:00:51.420> notes

00:00:51.860 --> 00:00:51.870 
the intervals which is how the notes

00:00:51.870 --> 00:00:55.550 
the intervals which is how the notes
relate<00:00:52.650> to<00:00:53.220> a<00:00:53.550> major<00:00:53.880> scale<00:00:54.329> a<00:00:54.630> major<00:00:55.140> scale<00:00:55.500> is

00:00:55.550 --> 00:00:55.560 
relate to a major scale a major scale is

00:00:55.560 --> 00:00:58.220 
relate to a major scale a major scale is
going<00:00:55.860> to<00:00:55.920> have<00:00:56.070> the<00:00:56.100> numbers<00:00:56.520> 1<00:00:56.760> 2<00:00:56.940> 3<00:00:56.970> 4<00:00:57.390> 5<00:00:57.600> 6<00:00:57.899> 7

going to have the numbers 1 2 3 4 5 6 7

00:00:58.230 --> 00:01:01.069 
going to have the numbers 1 2 3 4 5 6 7
and<00:00:58.620> then<00:00:59.010> every<00:00:59.489> other<00:00:59.520> scale<00:01:00.210> is<00:01:00.570> going<00:01:01.020> to

00:01:01.069 --> 00:01:01.079 
and then every other scale is going to

00:01:01.079 --> 00:01:02.840 
and then every other scale is going to
be<00:01:01.200> an<00:01:01.290> alteration<00:01:02.010> of<00:01:02.130> that<00:01:02.340> and<00:01:02.610> i'm<00:01:02.700> going

00:01:02.840 --> 00:01:02.850 
be an alteration of that and i'm going

00:01:02.850 --> 00:01:04.340 
be an alteration of that and i'm going
to<00:01:02.940> show<00:01:03.090> you<00:01:03.120> that<00:01:03.239> here<00:01:03.600> in<00:01:03.690> just<00:01:03.720> a<00:01:03.960> second

00:01:04.340 --> 00:01:04.350 
to show you that here in just a second

00:01:07.730 --> 00:01:07.740 
you also have the option of showing the

00:01:07.740 --> 00:01:10.520 
you also have the option of showing the
scales<00:01:08.159> either<00:01:08.670> in<00:01:09.060> a<00:01:09.179> right-handed<00:01:09.990> format

00:01:10.520 --> 00:01:10.530 
scales either in a right-handed format

00:01:10.530 --> 00:01:13.429 
scales either in a right-handed format
or<00:01:10.859> four<00:01:11.819> lefties<00:01:12.179> there's<00:01:12.749> left-handed

00:01:13.429 --> 00:01:13.439 
or four lefties there's left-handed

00:01:13.439 --> 00:01:14.989 
or four lefties there's left-handed
format<00:01:13.799> for<00:01:14.130> this<00:01:14.249> demonstration<00:01:14.429> I'm<00:01:14.850> just

00:01:14.989 --> 00:01:14.999 
format for this demonstration I'm just

00:01:14.999 --> 00:01:16.849 
format for this demonstration I'm just
going<00:01:15.119> to<00:01:15.179> keep<00:01:15.329> it<00:01:15.509> in<00:01:15.659> right-handed<00:01:16.380> format

00:01:16.849 --> 00:01:16.859 
going to keep it in right-handed format

00:01:16.859 --> 00:01:19.309 
going to keep it in right-handed format
which<00:01:17.520> is<00:01:17.759> kind<00:01:18.119> of<00:01:18.179> the<00:01:18.270> same<00:01:18.450> perspective<00:01:18.810> as

00:01:19.309 --> 00:01:19.319 
which is kind of the same perspective as

00:01:19.319 --> 00:01:22.370 
which is kind of the same perspective as
a<00:01:19.649> chord<00:01:20.100> chart<00:01:20.399> so<00:01:20.700> you're<00:01:21.420> going<00:01:21.509> to<00:01:21.600> see<00:01:21.869> the

00:01:22.370 --> 00:01:22.380 
a chord chart so you're going to see the

00:01:22.380 --> 00:01:25.969 
a chord chart so you're going to see the
line<00:01:22.679> over<00:01:23.219> on<00:01:23.459> the<00:01:23.850> far<00:01:24.060> left<00:01:24.509> the<00:01:25.049> vertical

00:01:25.969 --> 00:01:25.979 
line over on the far left the vertical

00:01:25.979 --> 00:01:28.910 
line over on the far left the vertical
line<00:01:26.159> is<00:01:26.459> the<00:01:26.670> sixth<00:01:26.969> string<00:01:27.060> and<00:01:27.509> the<00:01:28.409> line<00:01:28.679> on

00:01:28.910 --> 00:01:28.920 
line is the sixth string and the line on

00:01:28.920 --> 00:01:31.999 
line is the sixth string and the line on
the<00:01:29.039> very<00:01:29.249> far<00:01:29.670> right<00:01:30.479> is<00:01:30.810> going<00:01:31.679> to<00:01:31.770> be<00:01:31.859> your

00:01:31.999 --> 00:01:32.009 
the very far right is going to be your

00:01:32.009 --> 00:01:33.980 
the very far right is going to be your
first<00:01:32.219> string<00:01:32.639> the<00:01:32.939> thinnest<00:01:33.329> string<00:01:33.420> highest

00:01:33.980 --> 00:01:33.990 
first string the thinnest string highest

00:01:33.990 --> 00:01:37.099 
first string the thinnest string highest
sounding<00:01:34.319> string<00:01:34.529> all<00:01:35.249> right<00:01:36.119> now<00:01:36.749> let's<00:01:36.990> take

00:01:37.099 --> 00:01:37.109 
sounding string all right now let's take

00:01:37.109 --> 00:01:40.699 
sounding string all right now let's take
a<00:01:37.170> look<00:01:37.259> at<00:01:37.560> how<00:01:37.859> you<00:01:37.920> might<00:01:38.279> use<00:01:38.539> the<00:01:39.709> the

00:01:40.699 --> 00:01:40.709 
a look at how you might use the the

00:01:40.709 --> 00:01:42.830 
a look at how you might use the the
scale<00:01:41.009> finding<00:01:41.459> feature<00:01:41.670> here<00:01:41.999> the<00:01:42.630> first

00:01:42.830 --> 00:01:42.840 
scale finding feature here the first

00:01:42.840 --> 00:01:45.440 
scale finding feature here the first
thing<00:01:42.929> is<00:01:43.109> you<00:01:43.139> see<00:01:43.259> these<00:01:43.590> major<00:01:44.450> headings

00:01:45.440 --> 00:01:45.450 
thing is you see these major headings

00:01:45.450 --> 00:01:48.199 
thing is you see these major headings
here<00:01:45.749> one<00:01:45.929> says<00:01:46.200> cords<00:01:46.709> and<00:01:46.889> one<00:01:47.429> says<00:01:47.759> scales

00:01:48.199 --> 00:01:48.209 
here one says cords and one says scales

00:01:48.209 --> 00:01:52.219 
here one says cords and one says scales
and<00:01:48.509> even<00:01:49.170> though<00:01:49.429> this<00:01:50.429> says<00:01:50.700> cords<00:01:51.359> what<00:01:52.079> you

00:01:52.219 --> 00:01:52.229 
and even though this says cords what you

00:01:52.229 --> 00:01:55.550 
and even though this says cords what you
see<00:01:52.590> right<00:01:52.619> here<00:01:53.490> would<00:01:54.240> be<00:01:54.299> the<00:01:54.569> root<00:01:54.929> of<00:01:55.200> the

00:01:55.550 --> 00:01:55.560 
see right here would be the root of the

00:01:55.560 --> 00:01:57.919 
see right here would be the root of the
scale<00:01:55.829> of<00:01:55.889> the<00:01:56.399> the<00:01:56.759> main<00:01:57.029> note<00:01:57.450> of<00:01:57.659> the<00:01:57.779> scale

00:01:57.919 --> 00:01:57.929 
scale of the the main note of the scale

00:01:57.929 --> 00:02:00.260 
scale of the the main note of the scale
so<00:01:58.319> we<00:01:58.409> still<00:01:58.619> need<00:01:58.799> to<00:01:58.919> use<00:01:59.189> this<00:01:59.819> first

00:02:00.260 --> 00:02:00.270 
so we still need to use this first

00:02:00.270 --> 00:02:01.819 
so we still need to use this first
column<00:02:00.630> over<00:02:00.929> here<00:02:01.079> and<00:02:01.349> I'm<00:02:01.439> going<00:02:01.529> to<00:02:01.590> set

00:02:01.819 --> 00:02:01.829 
column over here and I'm going to set

00:02:01.829 --> 00:02:05.629 
column over here and I'm going to set
this<00:02:02.039> to<00:02:02.459> a<00:02:02.789> C<00:02:03.599> and<00:02:04.189> I'm<00:02:05.189> going<00:02:05.310> to<00:02:05.340> go<00:02:05.429> back<00:02:05.609> to

00:02:05.629 --> 00:02:05.639 
this to a C and I'm going to go back to

00:02:05.639 --> 00:02:08.749 
this to a C and I'm going to go back to
my<00:02:05.999> notes<00:02:06.959> so<00:02:07.319> you<00:02:07.439> see<00:02:07.619> the<00:02:07.799> actual<00:02:08.160> notes<00:02:08.550> of

00:02:08.749 --> 00:02:08.759 
my notes so you see the actual notes of

00:02:08.759 --> 00:02:11.869 
my notes so you see the actual notes of
a<00:02:08.849> C<00:02:09.030> major<00:02:09.240> scale<00:02:09.509> and<00:02:09.810> right<00:02:10.619> now<00:02:10.860> the<00:02:11.760> way

00:02:11.869 --> 00:02:11.879 
a C major scale and right now the way

00:02:11.879 --> 00:02:14.690 
a C major scale and right now the way
that<00:02:11.909> this<00:02:12.269> is<00:02:12.510> set<00:02:12.840> it's<00:02:13.260> showing<00:02:14.069> all<00:02:14.310> of<00:02:14.340> the

00:02:14.690 --> 00:02:14.700 
that this is set it's showing all of the

00:02:14.700 --> 00:02:15.800 
that this is set it's showing all of the
notes<00:02:14.909> of

00:02:15.800 --> 00:02:15.810 
notes of

00:02:15.810 --> 00:02:18.800 
notes of
C<00:02:16.170> major<00:02:16.349> scale<00:02:16.650> all<00:02:17.160> over<00:02:17.790> the<00:02:17.880> neck<00:02:18.060> up<00:02:18.450> to

00:02:18.800 --> 00:02:18.810 
C major scale all over the neck up to

00:02:18.810 --> 00:02:22.699 
C major scale all over the neck up to
the<00:02:18.930> 12th<00:02:19.110> fret<00:02:19.790> now<00:02:20.900> you<00:02:21.900> know<00:02:22.020> it's<00:02:22.110> great<00:02:22.530> to

00:02:22.699 --> 00:02:22.709 
the 12th fret now you know it's great to

00:02:22.709 --> 00:02:24.410 
the 12th fret now you know it's great to
get<00:02:22.830> an<00:02:22.920> overall<00:02:23.190> view<00:02:23.340> of<00:02:23.760> all<00:02:24.030> of<00:02:24.060> the<00:02:24.270> notes

00:02:24.410 --> 00:02:24.420 
get an overall view of all of the notes

00:02:24.420 --> 00:02:25.850 
get an overall view of all of the notes
that<00:02:24.660> are<00:02:24.690> in<00:02:24.810> a<00:02:24.840> particular<00:02:25.319> scale<00:02:25.620> but

00:02:25.850 --> 00:02:25.860 
that are in a particular scale but

00:02:25.860 --> 00:02:28.880 
that are in a particular scale but
that's<00:02:26.010> not<00:02:26.390> extremely<00:02:27.390> useful<00:02:27.930> when<00:02:28.680> trying

00:02:28.880 --> 00:02:28.890 
that's not extremely useful when trying

00:02:28.890 --> 00:02:32.360 
that's not extremely useful when trying
to<00:02:29.130> learn<00:02:29.280> some<00:02:29.550> scale<00:02:29.880> patterns<00:02:30.470> so<00:02:31.470> now<00:02:32.130> what

00:02:32.360 --> 00:02:32.370 
to learn some scale patterns so now what

00:02:32.370 --> 00:02:33.589 
to learn some scale patterns so now what
I'm<00:02:32.430> going<00:02:32.550> to<00:02:32.610> do<00:02:32.790> is<00:02:33.030> I'm<00:02:33.209> going<00:02:33.239> to<00:02:33.390> go<00:02:33.450> down

00:02:33.589 --> 00:02:33.599 
I'm going to do is I'm going to go down

00:02:33.599 --> 00:02:36.620 
I'm going to do is I'm going to go down
to<00:02:33.630> the<00:02:33.900> very<00:02:34.080> bottom<00:02:34.290> of<00:02:35.069> the<00:02:36.000> scale<00:02:36.239> finder

00:02:36.620 --> 00:02:36.630 
to the very bottom of the scale finder

00:02:36.630 --> 00:02:40.370 
to the very bottom of the scale finder
here<00:02:36.660> and<00:02:37.140> it<00:02:37.830> says<00:02:38.040> set<00:02:38.760> size<00:02:39.269> of<00:02:39.599> scope<00:02:40.019> here

00:02:40.370 --> 00:02:40.380 
here and it says set size of scope here

00:02:40.380 --> 00:02:42.800 
here and it says set size of scope here
on<00:02:40.530> the<00:02:40.680> left<00:02:40.920> at<00:02:41.190> the<00:02:41.310> bottom<00:02:41.340> left<00:02:41.880> side<00:02:42.390> and

00:02:42.810 --> 00:02:44.870 
on the left at the bottom left side and
what<00:02:43.739> I'm<00:02:43.830> going<00:02:43.950> to<00:02:43.980> do<00:02:44.160> is<00:02:44.430> I'm<00:02:44.610> going<00:02:44.700> to<00:02:44.760> use

00:02:44.870 --> 00:02:44.880 
what I'm going to do is I'm going to use

00:02:44.880 --> 00:02:48.160 
what I'm going to do is I'm going to use
this<00:02:45.060> just<00:02:45.959> kind<00:02:46.110> of<00:02:46.170> click<00:02:46.380> over<00:02:46.709> on<00:02:46.890> this

00:02:48.160 --> 00:02:48.170 
this just kind of click over on this

00:02:48.170 --> 00:02:51.800 
this just kind of click over on this
left<00:02:49.170> double<00:02:49.980> arrow<00:02:50.250> here<00:02:50.760> and<00:02:51.030> I'm<00:02:51.510> going<00:02:51.750> to

00:02:51.800 --> 00:02:51.810 
left double arrow here and I'm going to

00:02:51.810 --> 00:02:56.420 
left double arrow here and I'm going to
lower<00:02:52.590> that<00:02:52.830> down<00:02:53.120> to<00:02:54.140> five<00:02:55.140> the<00:02:55.920> reason<00:02:56.280> is

00:02:56.420 --> 00:02:56.430 
lower that down to five the reason is

00:02:56.430 --> 00:03:00.740 
lower that down to five the reason is
most<00:02:56.959> guitars<00:02:57.959> scale<00:02:58.620> forms<00:02:59.280> are<00:02:59.610> going<00:03:00.269> to<00:03:00.330> be

00:03:00.740 --> 00:03:00.750 
most guitars scale forms are going to be

00:03:00.750 --> 00:03:04.550 
most guitars scale forms are going to be
at<00:03:01.170> the<00:03:01.830> most<00:03:02.040> a<00:03:02.459> stretch<00:03:03.390> of<00:03:03.420> five<00:03:03.840> frets<00:03:04.290> any

00:03:04.550 --> 00:03:04.560 
at the most a stretch of five frets any

00:03:04.560 --> 00:03:06.949 
at the most a stretch of five frets any
more<00:03:04.799> than<00:03:04.950> that<00:03:04.980> you're<00:03:05.400> just<00:03:05.549> a<00:03:05.849> less<00:03:06.569> demand

00:03:06.949 --> 00:03:06.959 
more than that you're just a less demand

00:03:06.959 --> 00:03:09.080 
more than that you're just a less demand
less<00:03:07.440> tick<00:03:07.620> man<00:03:07.799> and<00:03:08.130> you'd<00:03:08.489> have<00:03:08.670> to<00:03:08.790> be<00:03:08.910> some

00:03:09.080 --> 00:03:09.090 
less tick man and you'd have to be some

00:03:09.090 --> 00:03:11.570 
less tick man and you'd have to be some
doing<00:03:09.330> some<00:03:09.540> big<00:03:10.110> stretches<00:03:10.470> or<00:03:10.890> shifts<00:03:11.489> and

00:03:11.570 --> 00:03:11.580 
doing some big stretches or shifts and

00:03:11.580 --> 00:03:13.850 
doing some big stretches or shifts and
so<00:03:11.700> what<00:03:11.910> we're<00:03:12.060> looking<00:03:12.090> for<00:03:12.420> right<00:03:12.930> here<00:03:13.410> are

00:03:13.850 --> 00:03:13.860 
so what we're looking for right here are

00:03:13.860 --> 00:03:17.089 
so what we're looking for right here are
just<00:03:14.040> some<00:03:14.220> kind<00:03:14.700> of<00:03:14.819> usable<00:03:15.510> scale<00:03:16.319> forms<00:03:16.830> and

00:03:17.089 --> 00:03:17.099 
just some kind of usable scale forms and

00:03:17.099 --> 00:03:20.780 
just some kind of usable scale forms and
so<00:03:17.510> the<00:03:18.510> next<00:03:18.810> thing<00:03:18.989> is<00:03:19.400> just<00:03:20.400> to<00:03:20.549> the<00:03:20.760> right

00:03:20.780 --> 00:03:20.790 
so the next thing is just to the right

00:03:20.790 --> 00:03:24.770 
so the next thing is just to the right
of<00:03:21.000> that<00:03:21.180> there's<00:03:21.660> a<00:03:21.780> scope<00:03:22.820> fret<00:03:23.820> position

00:03:24.770 --> 00:03:24.780 
of that there's a scope fret position

00:03:24.780 --> 00:03:26.509 
of that there's a scope fret position
right<00:03:25.140> now<00:03:25.170> there's<00:03:25.650> a<00:03:25.709> one<00:03:26.040> that<00:03:26.310> means

00:03:26.509 --> 00:03:26.519 
right now there's a one that means

00:03:26.519 --> 00:03:28.729 
right now there's a one that means
starting<00:03:26.910> the<00:03:27.120> first<00:03:27.329> fret<00:03:27.660> and<00:03:27.810> if<00:03:27.900> I<00:03:28.049> kind<00:03:28.650> of

00:03:28.729 --> 00:03:28.739 
starting the first fret and if I kind of

00:03:28.739 --> 00:03:30.590 
starting the first fret and if I kind of
click<00:03:28.920> that<00:03:29.070> up<00:03:29.310> it<00:03:29.609> just<00:03:30.329> kind<00:03:30.480> of<00:03:30.540> takes

00:03:30.590 --> 00:03:30.600 
click that up it just kind of takes

00:03:30.600 --> 00:03:33.920 
click that up it just kind of takes
scale<00:03:31.260> positions<00:03:31.920> going<00:03:32.880> on<00:03:33.090> up<00:03:33.390> the<00:03:33.540> neck<00:03:33.720> but

00:03:33.920 --> 00:03:33.930 
scale positions going on up the neck but

00:03:33.930 --> 00:03:35.870 
scale positions going on up the neck but
I'm<00:03:34.049> going<00:03:34.170> to<00:03:34.230> start<00:03:34.470> with<00:03:34.590> that<00:03:34.769> that<00:03:35.370> first

00:03:35.870 --> 00:03:35.880 
I'm going to start with that that first

00:03:35.880 --> 00:03:38.270 
I'm going to start with that that first
position<00:03:36.480> where<00:03:36.720> notes<00:03:36.959> are<00:03:37.109> going<00:03:37.230> to<00:03:37.290> be<00:03:37.440> in

00:03:38.270 --> 00:03:38.280 
position where notes are going to be in

00:03:38.280 --> 00:03:44.509 
position where notes are going to be in
the<00:03:38.549> first<00:03:39.500> fret<00:03:40.730> now<00:03:42.709> so<00:03:43.709> you<00:03:43.799> could<00:03:44.130> you

00:03:44.509 --> 00:03:44.519 
the first fret now so you could you

00:03:44.519 --> 00:03:46.849 
the first fret now so you could you
could<00:03:44.670> play<00:03:45.090> this<00:03:45.420> particular<00:03:46.109> scale<00:03:46.470> form

00:03:46.849 --> 00:03:46.859 
could play this particular scale form

00:03:46.859 --> 00:03:50.330 
could play this particular scale form
but<00:03:47.040> one<00:03:47.220> thing<00:03:47.489> to<00:03:48.500> take<00:03:49.500> a<00:03:49.530> look<00:03:49.799> at<00:03:50.010> in<00:03:50.160> this

00:03:50.330 --> 00:03:50.340 
but one thing to take a look at in this

00:03:50.340 --> 00:03:53.300 
but one thing to take a look at in this
particular<00:03:50.549> one<00:03:51.000> is<00:03:51.180> I<00:03:51.359> have<00:03:51.600> a<00:03:51.870> c-note<00:03:52.769> here

00:03:53.300 --> 00:03:53.310 
particular one is I have a c-note here

00:03:53.310 --> 00:03:59.809 
particular one is I have a c-note here
OOP<00:03:54.180> despaired<00:03:55.100> all<00:03:56.100> right<00:03:56.220> I<00:03:56.459> have<00:03:56.910> a<00:03:58.790> C<00:03:59.790> note

00:03:59.809 --> 00:03:59.819 
OOP despaired all right I have a C note

00:03:59.819 --> 00:04:03.559 
OOP despaired all right I have a C note
here<00:04:00.569> that<00:04:00.720> would<00:04:01.049> be<00:04:01.230> on<00:04:01.500> the<00:04:01.940> 5th<00:04:02.940> fret<00:04:03.239> of

00:04:03.559 --> 00:04:03.569 
here that would be on the 5th fret of

00:04:03.569 --> 00:04:05.509 
here that would be on the 5th fret of
the<00:04:03.660> 3rd<00:04:04.079> string<00:04:04.319> and<00:04:04.739> then<00:04:04.950> there's<00:04:05.160> also<00:04:05.340> a

00:04:05.509 --> 00:04:05.519 
the 3rd string and then there's also a

00:04:05.519 --> 00:04:09.110 
the 3rd string and then there's also a
c-note<00:04:06.060> here<00:04:06.540> on<00:04:07.130> the<00:04:08.130> second<00:04:08.579> string<00:04:08.790> at<00:04:09.090> the

c-note here on the second string at the

00:04:09.120 --> 00:04:11.720 
c-note here on the second string at the
first<00:04:09.480> fret<00:04:09.750> that's<00:04:09.959> actually<00:04:10.500> the<00:04:11.280> exact

00:04:11.720 --> 00:04:11.730 
first fret that's actually the exact

00:04:11.730 --> 00:04:14.210 
first fret that's actually the exact
same<00:04:12.150> note<00:04:12.569> so<00:04:12.840> if<00:04:12.959> you<00:04:13.079> were<00:04:13.260> you<00:04:14.130> were

00:04:14.210 --> 00:04:14.220 
same note so if you were you were

00:04:14.220 --> 00:04:17.330 
same note so if you were you were
playing<00:04:14.670> this<00:04:15.000> as<00:04:15.269> a<00:04:15.329> scale<00:04:16.169> form<00:04:16.620> you<00:04:17.250> would

00:04:17.330 --> 00:04:17.340 
playing this as a scale form you would

00:04:17.340 --> 00:04:20.170 
playing this as a scale form you would
want<00:04:17.579> to<00:04:17.639> choose<00:04:17.940> one<00:04:18.630> option<00:04:18.660> or<00:04:19.440> the<00:04:19.709> other

00:04:20.170 --> 00:04:20.180 
want to choose one option or the other

00:04:20.180 --> 00:04:22.490 
want to choose one option or the other
so<00:04:21.180> it<00:04:21.329> kind<00:04:21.510> of<00:04:21.570> gives<00:04:21.690> you<00:04:21.870> two<00:04:22.109> small

00:04:22.490 --> 00:04:22.500 
so it kind of gives you two small

00:04:22.500 --> 00:04:26.800 
so it kind of gives you two small
variations<00:04:23.280> of<00:04:23.460> that<00:04:23.840> particular<00:04:25.190> scale<00:04:26.190> form

00:04:26.800 --> 00:04:26.810 
variations of that particular scale form

00:04:26.810 --> 00:04:29.959 
variations of that particular scale form
now<00:04:27.810> again<00:04:27.990> I<00:04:28.200> could<00:04:28.260> switch<00:04:28.979> this<00:04:29.190> over<00:04:29.400> to

00:04:29.959 --> 00:04:29.969 
now again I could switch this over to

00:04:29.969 --> 00:04:33.619 
now again I could switch this over to
two<00:04:30.029> intervals<00:04:30.839> and<00:04:31.549> see<00:04:32.549> you<00:04:33.419> know<00:04:33.539> I<00:04:33.569> just

00:04:33.619 --> 00:04:33.629 
two intervals and see you know I just

00:04:33.629 --> 00:04:36.199 
two intervals and see you know I just
see<00:04:33.959> these<00:04:34.110> numbers<00:04:34.499> you<00:04:35.459> know<00:04:35.579> four<00:04:35.909> or<00:04:35.939> five

00:04:36.199 --> 00:04:36.209 
see these numbers you know four or five

00:04:36.209 --> 00:04:38.899 
see these numbers you know four or five
six<00:04:36.779> one<00:04:37.559> is<00:04:37.619> the<00:04:38.039> root<00:04:38.219> of<00:04:38.309> the<00:04:38.459> scale<00:04:38.699> that's

00:04:38.899 --> 00:04:38.909 
six one is the root of the scale that's

00:04:38.909 --> 00:04:43.219 
six one is the root of the scale that's
that's<00:04:39.419> the<00:04:39.659> sea<00:04:39.899> so<00:04:40.259> AC<00:04:40.709> major<00:04:41.459> scale<00:04:41.669> is<00:04:42.389> one

00:04:43.219 --> 00:04:43.229 
that's the sea so AC major scale is one

00:04:43.229 --> 00:04:45.709 
that's the sea so AC major scale is one
two<00:04:43.559> three<00:04:43.979> four<00:04:44.279> five<00:04:44.610> six<00:04:44.999> seven<00:04:45.360> that's

00:04:45.709 --> 00:04:45.719 
two three four five six seven that's

00:04:45.719 --> 00:04:48.469 
two three four five six seven that's
major<00:04:46.499> scales<00:04:46.919> are<00:04:47.159> always<00:04:47.579> the<00:04:47.849> notes<00:04:48.119> are

00:04:48.469 --> 00:04:48.479 
major scales are always the notes are

00:04:48.479 --> 00:04:51.319 
major scales are always the notes are
the<00:04:48.989> numbers<00:04:49.439> one<00:04:49.949> two<00:04:50.189> three<00:04:50.459> four<00:04:50.669> five<00:04:50.729> six

00:04:51.319 --> 00:04:51.329 
the numbers one two three four five six

00:04:51.329 --> 00:04:58.009 
the numbers one two three four five six
and<00:04:51.629> seven<00:04:52.369> now<00:04:53.369> I'm<00:04:54.179> going<00:04:54.419> to<00:04:54.509> go<00:04:55.429> and<00:04:57.019> move

00:04:58.009 --> 00:04:58.019 
and seven now I'm going to go and move

00:04:58.019 --> 00:05:00.229 
and seven now I'm going to go and move
up<00:04:58.229> one<00:04:58.439> fret<00:04:58.769> so<00:04:59.339> I'm<00:04:59.429> going<00:04:59.579> to<00:04:59.610> now<00:04:59.759> move<00:04:59.789> so

00:05:00.229 --> 00:05:00.239 
up one fret so I'm going to now move so

00:05:00.239 --> 00:05:02.989 
up one fret so I'm going to now move so
the<00:05:00.539> lowest<00:05:00.989> note<00:05:01.199> would<00:05:01.439> be<00:05:01.589> on<00:05:01.829> the<00:05:02.549> second

00:05:02.989 --> 00:05:02.999 
the lowest note would be on the second

00:05:02.999 --> 00:05:06.919 
the lowest note would be on the second
fret<00:05:03.149> so<00:05:03.929> now<00:05:04.049> I<00:05:04.079> get<00:05:04.349> a<00:05:04.589> a<00:05:04.969> different<00:05:05.969> kind<00:05:06.869> of

00:05:06.919 --> 00:05:06.929 
fret so now I get a a different kind of

00:05:06.929 --> 00:05:10.639 
fret so now I get a a different kind of
scale<00:05:07.289> pattern<00:05:07.799> that<00:05:08.279> is<00:05:08.519> C<00:05:09.149> major<00:05:09.449> that<00:05:10.319> I<00:05:10.349> can

00:05:10.639 --> 00:05:10.649 
scale pattern that is C major that I can

00:05:10.649 --> 00:05:11.899 
scale pattern that is C major that I can
play<00:05:10.889> and<00:05:11.039> this<00:05:11.099> time<00:05:11.309> there<00:05:11.519> isn't<00:05:11.789> any

00:05:11.899 --> 00:05:11.909 
play and this time there isn't any

00:05:11.909 --> 00:05:13.669 
play and this time there isn't any
doubling<00:05:12.419> up<00:05:12.569> so<00:05:12.839> I<00:05:12.869> don't<00:05:13.049> have<00:05:13.139> to<00:05:13.229> choose

00:05:13.669 --> 00:05:13.679 
doubling up so I don't have to choose

00:05:13.679 --> 00:05:16.429 
doubling up so I don't have to choose
one<00:05:14.009> note<00:05:14.249> or<00:05:14.399> the<00:05:14.489> other<00:05:14.639> up<00:05:14.969> to<00:05:15.629> the<00:05:15.749> 3rd<00:05:15.989> fret

00:05:16.429 --> 00:05:16.439 
one note or the other up to the 3rd fret

00:05:16.439 --> 00:05:25.789 
one note or the other up to the 3rd fret
you<00:05:17.309> know<00:05:17.429> another<00:05:18.299> scale<00:05:18.719> position<00:05:19.409> so<00:05:24.799> so

00:05:25.789 --> 00:05:25.799 
you know another scale position so so

00:05:25.799 --> 00:05:27.499 
you know another scale position so so
they're<00:05:25.949> going<00:05:26.159> on<00:05:26.429> up<00:05:26.639> there<00:05:26.849> were<00:05:27.029> you<00:05:27.269> know

00:05:27.499 --> 00:05:27.509 
they're going on up there were you know

00:05:27.509 --> 00:05:29.629 
they're going on up there were you know
I<00:05:27.929> got<00:05:28.409> another<00:05:28.589> situation<00:05:28.860> where<00:05:29.219> I've<00:05:29.429> got

00:05:29.629 --> 00:05:29.639 
I got another situation where I've got

00:05:29.639 --> 00:05:32.419 
I got another situation where I've got
you<00:05:30.269> know<00:05:30.360> a<00:05:30.389> G<00:05:31.110> on<00:05:31.289> one<00:05:31.559> string<00:05:31.919> and<00:05:32.159> then<00:05:32.249> the

00:05:32.419 --> 00:05:32.429 
you know a G on one string and then the

00:05:32.429 --> 00:05:34.069 
you know a G on one string and then the
very<00:05:32.519> next<00:05:32.639> string<00:05:33.059> there's<00:05:33.299> a<00:05:33.360> G<00:05:33.569> so<00:05:33.779> I'd<00:05:33.899> want

00:05:34.069 --> 00:05:34.079 
very next string there's a G so I'd want

00:05:34.079 --> 00:05:35.540 
very next string there's a G so I'd want
to<00:05:34.139> choose<00:05:34.409> one<00:05:34.709> or<00:05:34.739> the<00:05:34.829> other<00:05:34.889> but<00:05:35.219> this<00:05:35.339> is<00:05:35.519> a

00:05:35.540 --> 00:05:35.550 
to choose one or the other but this is a

00:05:35.550 --> 00:05:38.029 
to choose one or the other but this is a
great<00:05:35.879> way<00:05:35.909> to<00:05:36.379> find<00:05:37.379> some<00:05:37.709> different

00:05:38.029 --> 00:05:38.039 
great way to find some different

00:05:38.039 --> 00:05:39.559 
great way to find some different
fingerings<00:05:38.550> that<00:05:38.849> you<00:05:38.969> might<00:05:39.179> not<00:05:39.360> have

00:05:39.559 --> 00:05:39.569 
fingerings that you might not have

00:05:39.569 --> 00:05:42.589 
fingerings that you might not have
thought<00:05:39.629> of<00:05:40.189> for<00:05:41.189> some<00:05:41.550> different<00:05:41.969> scales<00:05:42.329> and

00:05:42.589 --> 00:05:42.599 
thought of for some different scales and

00:05:42.599 --> 00:05:45.499 
thought of for some different scales and
this<00:05:42.719> also<00:05:42.899> this<00:05:43.229> has<00:05:43.409> major<00:05:44.129> and<00:05:44.729> you<00:05:45.419> know

00:05:45.499 --> 00:05:45.509 
this also this has major and you know

00:05:45.509 --> 00:05:49.309 
this also this has major and you know
harmonic<00:05:46.199> minor<00:05:46.489> melodic<00:05:47.489> minor<00:05:48.119> there's<00:05:48.659> you

00:05:49.309 --> 00:05:49.319 
harmonic minor melodic minor there's you

00:05:49.319 --> 00:05:52.999 
harmonic minor melodic minor there's you
know<00:05:49.349> a<00:05:49.739> ton<00:05:50.639> of<00:05:50.699> different<00:05:51.319> well<00:05:52.319> you<00:05:52.589> must

00:05:52.999 --> 00:05:53.009 
know a ton of different well you must

00:05:53.009 --> 00:05:55.429 
know a ton of different well you must
learn<00:05:53.489> your<00:05:53.729> super<00:05:54.059> Locrian<00:05:54.479> that's<00:05:54.839> if

00:05:55.429 --> 00:05:55.439 
learn your super Locrian that's if

00:05:55.439 --> 00:05:57.859 
learn your super Locrian that's if
you're<00:05:55.619> a<00:05:55.649> jazzer<00:05:55.949> you<00:05:56.639> know<00:05:56.759> super<00:05:57.749> low

00:05:57.859 --> 00:05:57.869 
you're a jazzer you know super low

00:05:57.869 --> 00:06:00.769 
you're a jazzer you know super low
Korean<00:05:58.169> is<00:05:58.289> actually<00:05:58.679> used<00:05:59.269> quite<00:06:00.269> a<00:06:00.329> bit<00:06:00.419> so

00:06:08.749 --> 00:06:08.759 
used so there's just a ton of them here

00:06:08.759 --> 00:06:13.759 
used so there's just a ton of them here
to<00:06:08.909> do<00:06:08.999> that<00:06:09.469> also<00:06:10.469> in<00:06:10.829> the<00:06:11.449> details<00:06:12.769> section

right here you see the name of the scale

00:06:19.259 --> 00:06:22.669 
right here you see the name of the scale
and<00:06:19.739> then<00:06:20.429> the<00:06:20.969> different<00:06:21.119> intervals<00:06:21.929> and<00:06:22.199> so

00:06:22.669 --> 00:06:22.679 
and then the different intervals and so

and then the different intervals and so
in<00:06:23.069> this<00:06:23.399> case<00:06:23.639> this<00:06:24.269> you<00:06:24.989> know<00:06:25.110> see<00:06:25.499> super

00:06:26.089 --> 00:06:26.099 
in this case this you know see super

00:06:26.099 --> 00:06:29.629 
in this case this you know see super
Locrian<00:06:26.639> mode<00:06:27.589> here<00:06:28.589> it<00:06:28.799> says<00:06:29.009> the<00:06:29.189> intervals

00:06:29.629 --> 00:06:29.639 
Locrian mode here it says the intervals

00:06:29.639 --> 00:06:34.729 
Locrian mode here it says the intervals
are<00:06:30.029> one<00:06:30.419> flat<00:06:31.289> 2<00:06:31.559> flat<00:06:31.589> 3<00:06:32.009> 3<00:06:32.849> flat<00:06:33.539> 5<00:06:33.599> sharp<00:06:34.409> 5

00:06:34.729 --> 00:06:34.739 
are one flat 2 flat 3 3 flat 5 sharp 5

00:06:34.739 --> 00:06:38.540 
are one flat 2 flat 3 3 flat 5 sharp 5
and<00:06:35.189> a<00:06:35.459> flat<00:06:35.729> 7<00:06:36.329> and<00:06:36.539> what<00:06:37.110> that<00:06:37.259> means<00:06:37.559> in<00:06:37.860> is<00:06:38.129> a

00:06:38.540 --> 00:06:38.550 
and a flat 7 and what that means in is a

00:06:38.550 --> 00:06:42.589 
and a flat 7 and what that means in is a
c-major<00:06:39.539> scale<00:06:40.039> was<00:06:41.039> just<00:06:41.339> one<00:06:41.639> two<00:06:42.089> three

00:06:42.589 --> 00:06:42.599 
c-major scale was just one two three

00:06:42.599 --> 00:06:43.670 
c-major scale was just one two three
four<00:06:43.019> five

00:06:43.670 --> 00:06:43.680 
four five

00:06:43.680 --> 00:06:48.110 
four five
so<00:06:44.190> a<00:06:44.220> flat<00:06:44.699> two<00:06:45.090> is<00:06:45.449> just<00:06:46.139> a<00:06:46.410> half<00:06:47.190> step<00:06:47.550> or<00:06:47.850> one

00:06:48.110 --> 00:06:48.120 
so a flat two is just a half step or one

00:06:48.120 --> 00:06:52.820 
so a flat two is just a half step or one
fret<00:06:48.509> lower<00:06:48.960> than<00:06:49.860> where<00:06:50.400> the<00:06:50.699> second<00:06:51.419> note<00:06:51.830> of

00:06:52.820 --> 00:06:52.830 
fret lower than where the second note of

00:06:52.830 --> 00:06:56.390 
fret lower than where the second note of
the<00:06:53.340> major<00:06:53.370> scale<00:06:53.880> would<00:06:54.479> be<00:06:54.720> so<00:06:55.289> a<00:06:55.650> c-major

00:06:56.390 --> 00:06:56.400 
the major scale would be so a c-major

00:06:56.400 --> 00:07:01.760 
the major scale would be so a c-major
scale<00:06:56.610> was<00:06:57.240> a<00:06:57.449> C<00:06:57.870> and<00:06:58.050> a<00:06:58.460> da1<00:06:59.460> into<00:06:59.729> to<00:06:59.940> this<00:07:00.900> see

00:07:01.760 --> 00:07:01.770 
scale was a C and a da1 into to this see

00:07:01.770 --> 00:07:05.029 
scale was a C and a da1 into to this see
super<00:07:02.280> Locrian<00:07:02.850> is<00:07:03.060> one<00:07:03.389> flat<00:07:03.750> too<00:07:04.050> so<00:07:04.320> it<00:07:04.470> bc

00:07:05.029 --> 00:07:05.039 
super Locrian is one flat too so it bc

00:07:05.039 --> 00:07:09.140 
super Locrian is one flat too so it bc
and<00:07:05.400> then<00:07:06.120> ad<00:07:06.930> flat<00:07:07.759> alright<00:07:08.759> so<00:07:08.910> i<00:07:08.940> hope<00:07:09.090> that

00:07:09.140 --> 00:07:09.150 
and then ad flat alright so i hope that

00:07:09.150 --> 00:07:11.029 
and then ad flat alright so i hope that
