okay<00:00:01.410> I<00:00:01.439> might<00:00:01.680> sound<00:00:01.890> a<00:00:02.040> little<00:00:02.070> bit

00:00:02.240 --> 00:00:02.250 
okay I might sound a little bit

00:00:02.250 --> 00:00:03.800 
okay I might sound a little bit
different<00:00:02.340> because<00:00:03.060> this<00:00:03.210> is<00:00:03.330> a<00:00:03.360> different

00:00:03.800 --> 00:00:03.810

00:04:03.830 --> 00:04:03.840 
means it's a four hundred volt capacitor

00:04:03.840 --> 00:04:06.360 
means it's a four hundred volt capacitor
but<00:04:04.840> they're<00:04:05.199> cool-looking<00:04:05.889> capacitors

00:04:06.360 --> 00:04:06.370

these<00:04:06.519> are<00:04:06.669> pre-war<00:04:07.299> capacitors<00:04:08.139> they<00:04:08.859> didn't

00:04:09.089 --> 00:04:09.099 
these are pre-war capacitors they didn't

00:04:09.099 --> 00:04:10.710 
these are pre-war capacitors they didn't
make<00:04:09.250> this<00:04:09.430> model<00:04:09.790> after<00:04:09.940> the<00:04:10.150> World<00:04:10.299> War<00:04:10.510> two

00:04:10.710 --> 00:04:10.720 
make this model after the World War two

00:04:10.720 --> 00:04:12.809 
make this model after the World War two
so<00:04:10.900> these<00:04:11.470> were<00:04:11.620> left<00:04:11.859> over<00:04:12.040> stock<00:04:12.519> when<00:04:12.729> they

00:04:12.809 --> 00:04:12.819 
so these were left over stock when they

00:04:12.819 --> 00:04:15.780 
so these were left over stock when they
manufactured<00:04:13.599> this<00:04:13.690> amplifier<00:04:14.370> very<00:04:15.370> very

00:04:15.780 --> 00:04:15.790 
manufactured this amplifier very very

00:04:15.790 --> 00:04:18.000 
manufactured this amplifier very very
hard<00:04:16.120> to<00:04:16.299> find<00:04:16.539> very<00:04:16.870> rare<00:04:17.229> but<00:04:17.590> they're<00:04:17.859> bad

00:04:18.000 --> 00:04:18.010 
hard to find very rare but they're bad

00:04:18.010 --> 00:04:19.920 
hard to find very rare but they're bad
and<00:04:18.310> they<00:04:18.400> had<00:04:18.549> to<00:04:18.639> be<00:04:18.760> changed<00:04:19.150> their

00:04:19.920 --> 00:04:19.930 
and they had to be changed their

00:04:19.930 --> 00:04:22.409 
and they had to be changed their
bakelite<00:04:20.470> and<00:04:20.949> of<00:04:21.279> course<00:04:21.519> capacitors<00:04:22.150> made

00:04:22.409 --> 00:04:22.419

by sheets of aluminum foil with an elect
white<00:04:26.400> impregnated<00:04:27.400> paper<00:04:27.610> in<00:04:28.540> between<00:04:28.870> the

00:04:29.400 --> 00:04:29.410 
white impregnated paper in between the

00:04:29.410 --> 00:04:31.500 
white impregnated paper in between the
sheets<00:04:29.650> of<00:04:29.830> aluminum<00:04:30.280> and<00:04:30.550> it's<00:04:31.090> rolled<00:04:31.360> up

00:04:31.500 --> 00:04:31.510 
sheets of aluminum and it's rolled up

00:04:31.510 --> 00:04:33.540 
sheets of aluminum and it's rolled up
like<00:04:31.720> a<00:04:31.750> jelly<00:04:32.080> roll<00:04:32.200> then<00:04:32.650> flattened<00:04:33.250> and<00:04:33.370> put

00:04:33.540 --> 00:04:33.550 
like a jelly roll then flattened and put

00:04:33.550 --> 00:04:36.570 
like a jelly roll then flattened and put
into<00:04:33.670> this<00:04:33.820> bakelite<00:04:34.300> case<00:04:34.600> and<00:04:35.020> in<00:04:35.530> time<00:04:35.860> the

00:04:36.570 --> 00:04:36.580 
into this bakelite case and in time the

00:04:36.580 --> 00:04:39.150 
into this bakelite case and in time the
aluminum<00:04:37.390> breaks<00:04:37.690> down<00:04:37.990> perforates<00:04:38.890> and

00:04:39.150 --> 00:04:39.160 
aluminum breaks down perforates and

00:04:39.160 --> 00:04:40.890 
aluminum breaks down perforates and
causes<00:04:39.550> leakage<00:04:39.910> and<00:04:40.180> that's<00:04:40.450> what<00:04:40.600> makes<00:04:40.780> the

00:04:40.890 --> 00:04:40.900 
causes leakage and that's what makes the

00:04:40.900 --> 00:04:44.580 
causes leakage and that's what makes the
caps<00:04:41.140> go<00:04:41.350> bad<00:04:42.810> as<00:04:43.810> you<00:04:44.020> can<00:04:44.170> see<00:04:44.320> in<00:04:44.410> here

00:04:44.580 --> 00:04:44.590 
caps go bad as you can see in here

00:04:44.590 --> 00:04:46.470 
caps go bad as you can see in here
here's<00:04:44.830> the<00:04:44.890> two<00:04:45.130> new<00:04:45.280> filter<00:04:45.640> capacitors<00:04:46.270> I

00:04:46.470 --> 00:04:46.480 
here's the two new filter capacitors I

00:04:46.480 --> 00:04:49.560 
here's the two new filter capacitors I
use<00:04:46.630> a<00:04:46.660> 100<00:04:47.260> microfarad<00:04:47.620> here<00:04:48.190> and<00:04:48.430> a<00:04:48.490> 68<00:04:49.120> micro

00:04:49.560 --> 00:04:49.570 
use a 100 microfarad here and a 68 micro

00:04:49.570 --> 00:04:51.720 
use a 100 microfarad here and a 68 micro
farrier<00:04:49.900> gives<00:04:50.110> it<00:04:50.200> a<00:04:50.260> little<00:04:50.410> extra<00:04:50.740> and

00:04:51.720 --> 00:04:51.730 
farrier gives it a little extra and

00:04:51.730 --> 00:04:53.850 
farrier gives it a little extra and
anyway<00:04:52.720> that's<00:04:52.930> it<00:04:53.110> so<00:04:53.320> we're<00:04:53.380> gonna<00:04:53.530> put<00:04:53.770> this

00:04:53.850 --> 00:04:53.860 
anyway that's it so we're gonna put this

00:04:53.860 --> 00:04:55.380 
anyway that's it so we're gonna put this
thing<00:04:53.920> all<00:04:54.220> back<00:04:54.460> together<00:04:54.640> gonna<00:04:55.090> have<00:04:55.210> to<00:04:55.300> be

00:04:55.380 --> 00:04:55.390 
thing all back together gonna have to be

00:04:55.390 --> 00:04:56.940 
thing all back together gonna have to be
clean<00:04:55.600> the<00:04:55.750> cabinet<00:04:56.170> and<00:04:56.290> this<00:04:56.440> player<00:04:56.710> will

00:04:56.940 --> 00:04:56.950 
clean the cabinet and this player will

00:04:56.950 --> 00:04:59.340 
clean the cabinet and this player will
be<00:04:57.010> done
