00:00:00.460 --> 00:00:06.250
 hello youtube friends today I bring you a 

00:00:04.060 --> 00:00:09.910
 Video about how to fix the error 

00:00:06.250 --> 00:00:12.849
 that give us windows 8 when we're 

00:00:09.910 --> 00:00:15.160
 working normally and do not get a 

00:00:12.849 --> 00:00:18.839
 little screen to go up where he tells us to 

00:00:15.160 --> 00:00:21.550
 we will restart our computer 

00:00:18.839 --> 00:00:26.649
 because he has found some errors in the 

00:00:21.550 --> 00:00:30.039
 I will leave you in an image of the 

00:00:26.649 --> 00:00:32.859
 error that today the little blue screen that 

00:00:30.039 --> 00:00:36.960
 it comes out when you are working 

00:00:32.859 --> 00:00:41.780
 normally i7 reboots the computer 

00:00:36.960 --> 00:00:43.940
 the little screen that comes out is going to be this 

00:00:41.780 --> 00:00:47.480
 that in my case like I use windows 8 

00:00:43.940 --> 00:00:49.790
 this one came out and I was restarting every 

00:00:47.480 --> 00:00:53.059
 two minutes and then followed the same 

00:00:49.790 --> 00:00:55.180
 error for more than the way you can 

00:00:53.059 --> 00:00:59.560
 follow the same mistake 

00:00:55.180 --> 00:01:02.180
 look on the internet and well I did not find 

00:00:59.560 --> 00:01:06.570
 a solution 

00:01:02.180 --> 00:01:09.810
 exact from my problem that there were many 

00:01:06.570 --> 00:01:14.190
 people who gave their solution 

00:01:09.810 --> 00:01:16.020
 different or one to a different problem 

00:01:14.190 --> 00:01:20.130
 so 

00:01:16.020 --> 00:01:21.689
 today I bring you the solution that 

00:01:20.130 --> 00:01:24.390
 It has also worked for me and I hope that 

00:01:21.689 --> 00:01:28.250
 it works for you maybe you can 

00:01:24.390 --> 00:01:28.250
 have another solution 

00:01:29.370 --> 00:01:35.470
 and you can have your comments what was 

00:01:32.770 --> 00:01:39.250
 your solution I'm going to give you some 

00:01:35.470 --> 00:01:41.890
 solutions that I managed to find and one of 

00:01:39.250 --> 00:01:46.119
 what worked for me then the 

00:01:41.890 --> 00:01:48.250
 error that came to me when I gave in 

00:01:46.119 --> 00:01:50.980
 the little button to see details came out 

00:01:48.250 --> 00:01:53.530
 is that 

00:01:50.980 --> 00:01:56.910
 these will be the errors that the then that 

00:01:53.530 --> 00:01:56.910
 my system has started 

00:01:56.920 --> 00:02:04.219
 and good the solution that I found was 

00:02:01.159 --> 00:02:06.350
 to uninstall the waiver that I 

00:02:04.219 --> 00:02:09.819
 I used that to do the some 

00:02:06.350 --> 00:02:09.819
 maintenance on other computers 

00:02:10.920 --> 00:02:15.030
 then at the moment that I install them 

00:02:13.260 --> 00:02:17.610
 that program because you made me very started 

00:02:15.030 --> 00:02:19.380
 to work properly you such 

00:02:17.610 --> 00:02:23.510
 once they do not have that program and have 

00:02:19.380 --> 00:02:26.659
 installed in the base 

00:02:23.510 --> 00:02:28.700
 it's not compatible with windows 8 and it's because 

00:02:26.659 --> 00:02:31.280
 what can this problem be? 

00:02:28.700 --> 00:02:34.519
 every time I recommend that they install them 

00:02:31.280 --> 00:02:36.620
 incentives and look for other than one of the 

00:02:34.519 --> 00:02:39.049
 what you recommend is to use sl 

00:02:36.620 --> 00:02:41.360
 set and step can also analyze 

00:02:39.049 --> 00:02:43.069
 because this problem can also be 

00:02:41.360 --> 00:02:45.620
 for a virus that is admitted out there 

00:02:43.069 --> 00:02:48.890
 for one of these our records as is 

00:02:45.620 --> 00:02:52.579
 in my case if they see that she found three 

00:02:48.890 --> 00:02:55.159
 threats then it's better to leave him like this 

00:02:52.579 --> 00:02:58.610
 keep looking for more of those bugs 

00:02:55.159 --> 00:03:01.430
 they have me wrong then 

00:02:58.610 --> 00:03:03.500
 if they are going to occupy also in life 

00:03:01.430 --> 00:03:05.160
 I do not recommend them if I felt a virus 

00:03:03.500 --> 00:03:07.380
 why 

00:03:05.160 --> 00:03:09.300
 in personal opinion because it does not work 

00:03:07.380 --> 00:03:12.170
 nothing with much respect for the 

00:03:09.300 --> 00:03:16.000
 developers but it does not convince me 

00:03:12.170 --> 00:03:19.470
 I'm staying with 90 

00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:22.960
 this is one of the problems that cause 

00:03:19.470 --> 00:03:26.290
 then this problem 

00:03:22.960 --> 00:03:28.420
 I recommend you go see 

00:03:26.290 --> 00:03:31.540
 programs by programs that have 

00:03:28.420 --> 00:03:34.270
 enough will play and watching program 

00:03:31.540 --> 00:03:36.880
 by program to see which one is 

00:03:34.270 --> 00:03:38.430
 is causing this error in the 

00:03:36.880 --> 00:03:41.560
 system 

00:03:38.430 --> 00:03:44.410
 that can be rotated 

00:03:41.560 --> 00:03:47.319
 to uninstall programs from the 

00:03:44.410 --> 00:03:49.660
 control panel also first of all 

00:03:47.319 --> 00:03:51.400
 I recommend you update the 

00:03:49.660 --> 00:03:54.310
 video drivers because also 

00:03:51.400 --> 00:03:58.819
 it can be the cause of that and that's why 

00:03:54.310 --> 00:04:02.030
 have they can go to the right click 

00:03:58.819 --> 00:04:03.990
 or team with you want to stay in 

00:04:02.030 --> 00:04:07.460
 properties 

00:04:03.990 --> 00:04:07.460
 If that 

00:04:07.650 --> 00:04:11.360
 they go to device manager 

00:04:15.930 --> 00:04:20.070
 then there will come out all the 

00:04:17.910 --> 00:04:23.400
 drivers that have installed and 

00:04:20.070 --> 00:04:25.200
 right there is going to leave you an option to 

00:04:23.400 --> 00:04:27.900
 to update 

00:04:25.200 --> 00:04:31.680
 for example let's hope that we stay 

00:04:27.900 --> 00:04:34.290
 for my meats then for example in 

00:04:31.680 --> 00:04:36.870
 based on the screen adapters 

00:04:34.290 --> 00:04:39.510
 spend your graphic driver 

00:04:36.870 --> 00:04:42.450
 read implies here and here is the 

00:04:39.510 --> 00:04:44.280
 button to update sauber then 

00:04:42.450 --> 00:04:46.110
 from there it will be updated if it is not 

00:04:44.280 --> 00:04:49.020
 corrects with that its probably not 

00:04:46.110 --> 00:04:51.120
 fill should be installing program by 

00:04:49.020 --> 00:04:54.860
 program and seeing which one is them 

00:04:51.120 --> 00:04:54.860
 causing the error 

00:04:54.969 --> 00:04:59.980
 it's all friends I hope you have them 

00:04:56.739 --> 00:05:03.210
 served do not forget to leave 

00:04:59.980 --> 00:05:06.610
 a like if it was helpful and a 

00:05:03.210 --> 00:05:09.520
 Comment if you have any problems and do not 

00:05:06.610 --> 00:05:12.440
 They know how to fix it, they let me 

00:05:09.520 --> 00:05:14.980
 to help them with that 

00:05:12.440 --> 00:05:14.980
 Thank you
