00:00:00.779 --> 00:00:02.539
 The mines in the Netherlands are closed. 

00:00:02.540 --> 00:00:05.720
 But how special is it that you will be able to see those attributes again later. 

00:00:06.880 --> 00:00:11.760
 This part eventually becomes the highest part of the job, so it is an important moment for us. 

00:00:14.120 --> 00:00:18.619
 In this series we take you through the development and ... 

00:00:18.619 --> 00:00:21.579
 ... creation of the newest spectacular roller coaster at Efteling. 

00:00:21.579 --> 00:00:28.979
 In this episode we look at the large amount of mine attributes that have been sent in after a call from the design team. 

00:00:28.979 --> 00:00:32.340
 We are also present at a special milestone. 

00:00:32.340 --> 00:00:35.310
 The highest point of construction is reached. 

00:00:35.310 --> 00:00:38.970
 This is 'The Making-of: Baron 1898'. 

00:00:46.140 --> 00:00:53.480
 To decorate the interior of Baron 1898, the Efteling is looking for original mining attributes. 

00:00:54.030 --> 00:00:57.450
 The earlier call was answered well. 

00:00:57.450 --> 00:01:00.880
 A few weeks ago we made a call to collect mine attributes. 

00:01:00.880 --> 00:01:04.290
 That went very well, because we received many responses. 

00:01:04.290 --> 00:01:08.570
 A number of special things that we have received is a whole collection of mine lamps. 

00:01:09.890 --> 00:01:12.479
 Mine helmets and telephones used in mining. 

00:01:12.479 --> 00:01:16.620
 These are really the attributes that you can't just buy somewhere and we are very happy with that. 

00:01:17.560 --> 00:01:22.020
 We certainly don't have enough yet, because to make it believable we really need a lot. 

00:01:22.020 --> 00:01:23.660
 So we are still looking for a lot of things. 

00:01:27.850 --> 00:01:31.360
 To create mass, we also have attributes reproduced. 

00:01:32.280 --> 00:01:38.400
 For example, we had helmets copied, so that we have forty the same helmets. 

00:01:38.650 --> 00:01:42.210
 By applying very small details or choosing certain colors, it becomes Eftelings. 

00:01:45.950 --> 00:01:49.000
 The mines in the Netherlands are closed. But how special is it that you are here ... 

00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:52.900
 ... can walk through such a space and see those mine attributes again? 

00:01:52.910 --> 00:01:56.210
 Because of the real stuff, the attraction will feel like a real mine. 

00:02:02.770 --> 00:02:07.470
 While the search for mine attributes for the inside of the attraction continues. 

00:02:07.470 --> 00:02:12.029
 Hard work is being done on the authentic details of the station building on the construction site. 

00:02:12.220 --> 00:02:17.240
 The building is in the final phase, the structural work is in progress and we are now busy with the theme. 

00:02:17.240 --> 00:02:20.600
 The real beautiful elements will now come into the building. 

00:02:21.220 --> 00:02:22.780
 You can see that on the outside. 

00:02:22.780 --> 00:02:28.580
 Think of the steel frameworks, the shading in, the colors, the openwork above the entrance hall that is already in it. 

00:02:28.589 --> 00:02:31.090
 That makes it all the way to the times of that time. 

00:02:31.340 --> 00:02:33.220
 If you look at the chimney you can see it too. 

00:02:33.220 --> 00:02:36.980
 This has just been bricked, but you can already see that the chimney is blackened at the top. 

00:02:41.369 --> 00:02:44.749
 A lot is happening with the job now. We now really see the different parts emerge. 

00:02:44.980 --> 00:02:49.040
 The entire track is already in the tunnel and the lift has been installed. 

00:02:49.040 --> 00:02:52.320
 The installation was very exciting, because it was windy. 

00:02:52.329 --> 00:02:55.889
 We doubted whether we should allow the installation to continue or not. 

00:02:55.889 --> 00:03:00.439
 In the end, we opted for a large 400-tonne crane and a 200-tonne crane. 

00:03:00.439 --> 00:03:05.319
 The cranes together lifted the elevator and carefully lifted it into the building. 

00:03:05.319 --> 00:03:08.479
 That was really exciting. There was five centimeters of play on both sides. 

00:03:08.479 --> 00:03:11.899
 During hoisting, there was occasionally no play. 

00:03:17.259 --> 00:03:20.849
 The landing is also placed with two large cranes. 

00:03:20.849 --> 00:03:24.449
 We carefully lifted the platform and it fitted precisely. 

00:03:27.509 --> 00:03:34.559
 Behind us lies the part that goes over the elevator and that you will eventually hang on before you fall down. 

00:03:34.559 --> 00:03:39.879
 That part eventually becomes the highest point of the job and is an important moment for us. 

00:03:40.909 --> 00:03:42.829
 And perhaps the most important part of the job. 

00:03:46.019 --> 00:03:48.859
 Because this is the course that gives the 'thrill'. The visitor hangs there quietly and then dives down. 

00:03:54.949 --> 00:03:56.809
 And then the time has come. 

00:03:56.809 --> 00:04:04.089
 The last and highest lift section of Baron 1898 is lifted into place with the utmost precision. 

00:04:11.600 --> 00:04:12.220
 It worked. 

00:04:12.220 --> 00:04:19.620
 The highest point of Baron 1898 has been reached, a milestone celebrated on the construction site. 

00:04:19.620 --> 00:04:25.460
 1 September last year we started construction to open this summer. 

00:04:25.469 --> 00:04:30.789
 Now half a year later we reach the highest point, a unique moment! 

00:04:30.789 --> 00:04:33.279
 And which companies all work with it? 

00:04:33.279 --> 00:04:39.679
 Hoppenbrouwers, Gubbels, BOM Engineering, Heijmans, John van Gestel construction company, Van den Bersselaar ... 

00:04:39.680 --> 00:04:49.580
 Brouwers Groenaannemers, TIAB, Bartels, Van Nunen, B&amp;M, Van Aken Architects, Fugro, Hoffmann Groep, TÃœV ... 

00:04:49.580 --> 00:04:51.000
 ... Van der Kolk, Alcedo and L&amp;L. 

00:04:51.009 --> 00:04:52.720
 I think all Brabant companies 

00:04:52.720 --> 00:04:55.900
 As Efteling, we are very proud of that. 

00:05:12.219 --> 00:05:19.079
