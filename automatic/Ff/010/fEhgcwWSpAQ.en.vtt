through<00:00:14.370> this<00:00:14.849> time-lapse<00:00:16.490> so<00:00:17.490> CN<00:00:18.029> tower<00:00:18.300> is<00:00:18.600> a

00:00:18.620 --> 00:00:18.630 
through this time-lapse so CN tower is a

00:00:18.630 --> 00:00:21.320 
through this time-lapse so CN tower is a
tower<00:00:18.930> that<00:00:19.109> are<00:00:19.590> located<00:00:20.189> in<00:00:20.460> Toronto<00:00:20.640> and

00:00:21.320 --> 00:00:21.330 
tower that are located in Toronto and

00:00:21.330 --> 00:00:24.470 
tower that are located in Toronto and
have<00:00:21.630> had<00:00:21.869> the<00:00:22.050> world<00:00:22.230> record<00:00:22.710> in<00:00:22.949> height<00:00:23.699> for

00:00:24.470 --> 00:00:24.480 
have had the world record in height for

00:00:24.480 --> 00:00:25.849 
have had the world record in height for
almost<00:00:24.930> 40<00:00:25.320> years

00:00:25.849 --> 00:00:25.859 
almost 40 years

00:00:25.859 --> 00:00:30.560 
almost 40 years
it<00:00:26.279> could<00:00:26.640> passed<00:00:27.000> in<00:00:27.380> 2007<00:00:28.380> if<00:00:29.510> you<00:00:30.510> are

00:00:30.560 --> 00:00:30.570 
it could passed in 2007 if you are

00:00:30.570 --> 00:00:32.600 
it could passed in 2007 if you are
familiar<00:00:30.869> with<00:00:31.230> CN<00:00:31.769> tower<00:00:32.009> you<00:00:32.250> have<00:00:32.340> probably

00:00:32.600 --> 00:00:32.610 
familiar with CN tower you have probably

00:00:32.610 --> 00:00:34.160 
familiar with CN tower you have probably
noticed<00:00:32.759> I'm<00:00:33.120> building<00:00:33.390> this<00:00:33.480> with<00:00:33.690> four<00:00:33.960> legs

00:00:34.160 --> 00:00:34.170 
noticed I'm building this with four legs

00:00:34.170 --> 00:00:36.950 
noticed I'm building this with four legs
instead<00:00:34.739> of<00:00:34.800> three<00:00:35.340> if<00:00:36.000> I<00:00:36.300> were<00:00:36.480> to<00:00:36.630> build<00:00:36.780> with

00:00:36.950 --> 00:00:36.960 
instead of three if I were to build with

00:00:36.960 --> 00:00:38.990 
instead of three if I were to build with
four<00:00:37.200> legs<00:00:37.380> I<00:00:37.590> think<00:00:37.680> I<00:00:38.010> would<00:00:38.460> have<00:00:38.670> to<00:00:38.879> make

00:00:38.990 --> 00:00:39.000 
four legs I think I would have to make

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:40.670 
four legs I think I would have to make
it<00:00:39.120> a<00:00:39.239> lot<00:00:39.360> bigger<00:00:39.660> if<00:00:39.989> I<00:00:40.050> wanted<00:00:40.320> it<00:00:40.410> to<00:00:40.559> look

00:00:40.670 --> 00:00:40.680 
it a lot bigger if I wanted it to look

00:00:40.680 --> 00:00:44.959 
it a lot bigger if I wanted it to look
nice<00:00:41.010> I<00:00:42.829> think<00:00:43.829> I<00:00:43.980> should<00:00:44.160> point<00:00:44.340> out<00:00:44.520> that<00:00:44.820> I'm

00:00:44.959 --> 00:00:44.969 
nice I think I should point out that I'm

00:00:44.969 --> 00:00:46.940 
nice I think I should point out that I'm
using<00:00:45.120> a<00:00:45.300> transparent<00:00:45.660> glass<00:00:46.020> right<00:00:46.680> now<00:00:46.739> I

00:00:46.940 --> 00:00:46.950 
using a transparent glass right now I

00:00:46.950 --> 00:00:49.190 
using a transparent glass right now I
will<00:00:47.280> change<00:00:47.460> it<00:00:47.730> out<00:00:47.910> to<00:00:48.180> a<00:00:48.210> colored<00:00:48.600> one<00:00:48.840> when

00:00:49.190 --> 00:00:49.200 
will change it out to a colored one when

00:00:49.200 --> 00:00:51.470 
will change it out to a colored one when
we<00:00:49.379> update<00:00:49.710> with<00:00:49.890> 1.7<00:00:50.579> because<00:00:51.180> this<00:00:51.360> is

00:00:51.470 --> 00:00:51.480 
we update with 1.7 because this is

00:00:51.480 --> 00:00:53.510 
we update with 1.7 because this is
actually<00:00:51.660> 1.6<00:00:52.289> and<00:00:52.500> I'm<00:00:52.770> doing<00:00:52.980> it<00:00:53.160> because<00:00:53.309> I

00:00:53.510 --> 00:00:53.520 
actually 1.6 and I'm doing it because I

00:00:53.520 --> 00:00:55.580 
actually 1.6 and I'm doing it because I
want<00:00:53.610> to<00:00:53.760> record<00:00:54.120> with<00:00:54.539> the<00:00:54.629> camera<00:00:54.989> mouth<00:00:55.230> so

00:00:55.580 --> 00:00:55.590 
want to record with the camera mouth so

00:00:55.590 --> 00:00:56.840 
want to record with the camera mouth so
in<00:00:55.710> the<00:00:55.800> end<00:00:55.920> of<00:00:56.039> this<00:00:56.129> time-lapse<00:00:56.370> we<00:00:56.760> will

00:00:56.840 --> 00:00:56.850 
in the end of this time-lapse we will

00:00:56.850 --> 00:00:59.750 
in the end of this time-lapse we will
update<00:00:57.000> to<00:00:57.300> 1.7<00:00:58.260> and<00:00:58.829> I<00:00:58.949> can<00:00:59.129> put<00:00:59.280> in<00:00:59.460> the<00:00:59.579> right

00:00:59.750 --> 00:00:59.760 
update to 1.7 and I can put in the right

00:00:59.760 --> 00:01:04.219 
update to 1.7 and I can put in the right
color<00:01:00.030> on<00:01:00.149> the<00:01:00.449> glass<00:01:02.390> so<00:01:03.390> I'm<00:01:03.600> making<00:01:03.780> sort<00:01:04.080> of

00:01:04.219 --> 00:01:04.229 
color on the glass so I'm making sort of

00:01:04.229 --> 00:01:06.440 
color on the glass so I'm making sort of
circle<00:01:04.769> here<00:01:05.010> I<00:01:05.040> can't<00:01:05.339> really<00:01:05.400> describe<00:01:06.240> it

00:01:06.440 --> 00:01:06.450 
circle here I can't really describe it

00:01:06.450 --> 00:01:08.660 
circle here I can't really describe it
as<00:01:06.600> something<00:01:07.170> else<00:01:07.350> even<00:01:08.040> though<00:01:08.130> it's<00:01:08.310> a<00:01:08.430> bit

00:01:08.660 --> 00:01:08.670 
as something else even though it's a bit

00:01:08.670 --> 00:01:10.700 
as something else even though it's a bit
flatter<00:01:09.030> than<00:01:09.360> circle<00:01:09.780> is<00:01:09.869> in<00:01:10.140> the<00:01:10.290> middle

00:01:10.700 --> 00:01:10.710 
flatter than circle is in the middle

00:01:10.710 --> 00:01:23.520 
flatter than circle is in the middle
closer<00:01:11.220> to<00:01:11.460> the<00:01:11.580> tower

00:01:23.520 --> 00:01:23.530 

00:01:23.530 --> 00:01:26.430 

so<00:01:24.220> we<00:01:24.400> start<00:01:24.700> with<00:01:24.880> the<00:01:24.970> first<00:01:25.480> floor<00:01:25.990> and<00:01:26.260> the

00:01:26.430 --> 00:01:26.440 
so we start with the first floor and the

00:01:26.440 --> 00:01:28.700 
so we start with the first floor and the
glass<00:01:26.650> this<00:01:26.980> floor<00:01:27.280> below<00:01:27.580> of<00:01:27.760> course<00:01:27.970> also<00:01:28.630> be

00:01:28.700 --> 00:01:28.710 
glass this floor below of course also be

00:01:28.710 --> 00:01:31.410 
glass this floor below of course also be
exchanged<00:01:29.710> when<00:01:29.950> we<00:01:30.070> update<00:01:30.220> in<00:01:30.610> the<00:01:30.760> end<00:01:31.060> of

00:01:31.410 --> 00:01:31.420 
exchanged when we update in the end of

00:01:31.420 --> 00:01:37.860 
exchanged when we update in the end of
this<00:01:31.570> time-lapse<00:01:35.460> now<00:01:36.460> we<00:01:36.520> have<00:01:37.180> started<00:01:37.479> with

00:01:37.860 --> 00:01:37.870 
this time-lapse now we have started with

00:01:37.870 --> 00:01:41.520 
this time-lapse now we have started with
the<00:01:37.930> second<00:01:38.470> floor<00:01:38.680> of<00:01:39.180> three<00:01:40.350> total<00:01:41.350> and

00:01:41.520 --> 00:01:41.530 
the second floor of three total and

00:01:41.530 --> 00:01:55.700 
the second floor of three total and
there's<00:01:42.280> the<00:01:42.610> third<00:01:42.820> floor<00:01:43.090> as<00:01:43.300> well

00:01:55.700 --> 00:01:55.710 

00:01:55.710 --> 00:01:58.280 

so<00:01:56.640> now<00:01:56.880> I'm<00:01:57.120> starting<00:01:57.450> reading<00:01:57.900> some<00:01:58.050> sort<00:01:58.230> of

00:01:58.280 --> 00:01:58.290 
so now I'm starting reading some sort of

00:01:58.290 --> 00:02:13.080 
so now I'm starting reading some sort of
a<00:01:58.380> cone<00:01:58.740> structure<00:01:59.460> at<00:01:59.820> the<00:01:59.970> top

00:02:13.080 --> 00:02:13.090 

00:02:13.090 --> 00:02:15.940 

so<00:02:14.090> that<00:02:14.300> is<00:02:14.540> basically<00:02:14.840> the<00:02:15.380> body<00:02:15.620> of<00:02:15.800> this

00:02:15.940 --> 00:02:15.950 
so that is basically the body of this

00:02:15.950 --> 00:02:18.940 
so that is basically the body of this
build<00:02:16.250> done<00:02:16.850> now<00:02:17.180> we<00:02:17.240> just<00:02:17.480> need<00:02:17.750> to<00:02:18.560> continue

00:02:18.940 --> 00:02:18.950 
build done now we just need to continue

00:02:18.950 --> 00:02:21.340 
build done now we just need to continue
the<00:02:19.520> tower<00:02:19.820> the<00:02:20.540> tower<00:02:20.690> is<00:02:20.900> actually<00:02:21.230> an

00:02:21.340 --> 00:02:21.350 
the tower the tower is actually an

00:02:21.350 --> 00:02:23.650 
the tower the tower is actually an
antenna<00:02:21.770> so<00:02:22.100> it<00:02:22.430> needs<00:02:22.790> to<00:02:23.060> be<00:02:23.180> high<00:02:23.330> to<00:02:23.360> reach

00:02:23.650 --> 00:02:23.660 
antenna so it needs to be high to reach

00:02:23.660 --> 00:02:27.900 
antenna so it needs to be high to reach
out<00:02:24.020> to<00:02:24.050> off<00:02:24.440> I<00:02:24.860> want<00:02:25.730> to<00:02:25.850> listen<00:02:26.510> to<00:02:26.660> radio

00:02:27.900 --> 00:02:27.910 
out to off I want to listen to radio

00:02:27.910 --> 00:02:33.730 
out to off I want to listen to radio
suppose<00:02:31.270> the<00:02:32.270> main<00:02:32.480> building<00:02:32.990> itself<00:02:33.380> turn

00:02:33.730 --> 00:02:33.740 
suppose the main building itself turn

00:02:33.740 --> 00:02:36.370 
suppose the main building itself turn
out<00:02:33.890> to<00:02:34.040> be<00:02:34.070> a<00:02:34.490> bit<00:02:35.030> bigger<00:02:35.420> than<00:02:35.690> I<00:02:35.810> expected

00:02:36.370 --> 00:02:36.380 
out to be a bit bigger than I expected

00:02:36.380 --> 00:02:39.130 
out to be a bit bigger than I expected
so<00:02:36.710> I'm<00:02:36.950> redoing<00:02:37.940> the<00:02:38.150> circle<00:02:38.600> I'm<00:02:38.690> making<00:02:39.020> it

00:02:39.130 --> 00:02:39.140 
so I'm redoing the circle I'm making it

00:02:39.140 --> 00:02:41.860 
so I'm redoing the circle I'm making it
a<00:02:39.260> lot<00:02:39.590> bigger<00:02:40.040> so<00:02:40.460> it's<00:02:40.640> works<00:02:41.330> on<00:02:41.510> the<00:02:41.600> scale

00:02:41.860 --> 00:02:41.870 
a lot bigger so it's works on the scale

00:02:41.870 --> 00:02:55.120 
a lot bigger so it's works on the scale
with<00:02:42.080> rest<00:02:42.320> of<00:02:42.440> the<00:02:42.530> build<00:02:53.890> since<00:02:54.890> I<00:02:55.010> were

00:02:55.120 --> 00:02:55.130 
with rest of the build since I were

00:02:55.130 --> 00:02:57.730 
with rest of the build since I were
actually<00:02:55.280> have<00:02:55.550> a<00:02:55.580> little<00:02:55.870> small<00:02:56.870> lookout

00:02:57.730 --> 00:02:57.740 
actually have a little small lookout

00:02:57.740 --> 00:03:02.690 
actually have a little small lookout
tower<00:02:57.980> near<00:02:58.520> the<00:02:58.550> top

00:03:02.690 --> 00:03:02.700 

00:03:02.700 --> 00:03:06.300 

there's<00:03:03.700> that<00:03:03.999> antenna<00:03:05.040> and<00:03:06.040> the<00:03:06.189> other

00:03:06.300 --> 00:03:06.310 
there's that antenna and the other

00:03:06.310 --> 00:03:09.420 
there's that antenna and the other
recording<00:03:06.849> gets<00:03:07.719> a<00:03:07.930> bit<00:03:08.290> weird<00:03:08.799> here

00:03:09.420 --> 00:03:09.430 
recording gets a bit weird here

00:03:09.430 --> 00:03:11.190 
recording gets a bit weird here
anyways<00:03:09.999> I<00:03:10.180> change<00:03:10.389> out<00:03:10.480> the<00:03:10.629> color<00:03:10.870> of<00:03:10.959> the

00:03:11.190 --> 00:03:11.200 
anyways I change out the color of the

00:03:11.200 --> 00:03:13.140 
anyways I change out the color of the
cone<00:03:11.530> itself<00:03:11.769> I<00:03:12.310> think<00:03:12.519> it<00:03:12.579> looks<00:03:12.760> better<00:03:12.999> with

00:03:13.140 --> 00:03:13.150 
cone itself I think it looks better with

00:03:13.150 --> 00:03:15.509 
cone itself I think it looks better with
gray<00:03:13.510> and<00:03:13.749> it<00:03:13.870> actually<00:03:14.230> looks<00:03:14.439> a<00:03:14.709> bit<00:03:15.129> more

00:03:15.509 --> 00:03:15.519 
gray and it actually looks a bit more

00:03:15.519 --> 00:03:22.229 
gray and it actually looks a bit more
like<00:03:15.579> CN<00:03:16.359> tower<00:03:16.599> itself<00:03:20.010> as<00:03:21.010> you<00:03:21.579> saw<00:03:21.790> I<00:03:21.819> made<00:03:22.209> a

00:03:22.229 --> 00:03:22.239 
like CN tower itself as you saw I made a

00:03:22.239 --> 00:03:24.440 
like CN tower itself as you saw I made a
few<00:03:22.540> tweaks<00:03:22.780> I<00:03:23.230> made<00:03:23.950> the<00:03:24.040> window<00:03:24.340> smaller

00:03:24.440 --> 00:03:24.450 
few tweaks I made the window smaller

00:03:24.450 --> 00:03:27.509 
few tweaks I made the window smaller
basically<00:03:25.450> and<00:03:25.689> now<00:03:25.900> I'm<00:03:26.170> now<00:03:26.859> I'm<00:03:27.010> adding<00:03:27.159> a

00:03:27.509 --> 00:03:27.519 
basically and now I'm now I'm adding a

00:03:27.519 --> 00:03:30.420 
basically and now I'm now I'm adding a
floor<00:03:27.939> here<00:03:28.299> it's<00:03:28.569> it's<00:03:29.530> opposed<00:03:29.919> to<00:03:30.099> a<00:03:30.129> floor

00:03:30.420 --> 00:03:30.430 
floor here it's it's opposed to a floor

00:03:30.430 --> 00:03:31.949 
floor here it's it's opposed to a floor
I<00:03:30.549> guess<00:03:30.730> and<00:03:31.000> it<00:03:31.060> looks<00:03:31.450> pretty<00:03:31.780> weird

00:03:31.949 --> 00:03:31.959 
I guess and it looks pretty weird

00:03:31.959 --> 00:03:50.290 
I guess and it looks pretty weird
without<00:03:32.349> one<00:03:32.620> so

00:03:50.290 --> 00:03:50.300 

00:03:50.300 --> 00:03:53.030 

now<00:03:51.300> you're<00:03:51.690> starting<00:03:51.990> meet<00:03:52.230> the<00:03:52.620> bill<00:03:52.800> this

00:03:53.030 --> 00:03:53.040 
now you're starting meet the bill this

00:03:53.040 --> 00:03:55.760 
now you're starting meet the bill this
looks<00:03:53.640> like<00:03:53.880> crap<00:03:54.480> right<00:03:54.750> now<00:03:54.900> but<00:03:55.380> when<00:03:55.590> we

00:03:55.760 --> 00:03:55.770 
looks like crap right now but when we

00:03:55.770 --> 00:03:58.340 
looks like crap right now but when we
update<00:03:56.190> and<00:03:56.400> change<00:03:56.459> out<00:03:56.910> the<00:03:57.150> glass<00:03:57.390> and<00:03:57.720> have

00:03:58.340 --> 00:03:58.350 
update and change out the glass and have

00:03:58.350 --> 00:04:00.530 
update and change out the glass and have
some<00:03:58.560> light<00:03:58.800> into<00:03:59.220> it<00:03:59.370> it<00:03:59.550> will<00:03:59.970> look<00:04:00.150> way

00:04:00.530 --> 00:04:00.540 
some light into it it will look way

00:04:00.540 --> 00:04:11.559 
some light into it it will look way
better<00:04:00.720> you<00:04:01.110> have<00:04:01.200> to<00:04:01.319> trust<00:04:01.560> me<00:04:01.740> on<00:04:01.770> this<00:04:01.950> one

00:04:11.559 --> 00:04:11.569 

00:04:11.569 --> 00:04:15.559 

so<00:04:12.569> now<00:04:12.600> we<00:04:13.020> have<00:04:13.590> updated<00:04:14.010> 21.7<00:04:14.970> and<00:04:15.120> as<00:04:15.420> you

00:04:15.559 --> 00:04:15.569 
so now we have updated 21.7 and as you

00:04:15.569 --> 00:04:17.810 
so now we have updated 21.7 and as you
can<00:04:15.690> see<00:04:15.750> the<00:04:16.260> light<00:04:16.500> and<00:04:16.799> the<00:04:17.100> glass<00:04:17.340> makes

00:04:17.810 --> 00:04:17.820 
can see the light and the glass makes

00:04:17.820 --> 00:04:20.720 
can see the light and the glass makes
all<00:04:18.150> the<00:04:18.780> difference<00:04:18.959> and<00:04:19.530> I<00:04:20.100> think<00:04:20.130> it<00:04:20.519> looks

00:04:20.720 --> 00:04:20.730 
all the difference and I think it looks

00:04:20.730 --> 00:04:41.300 
all the difference and I think it looks
pretty<00:04:21.000> cool

00:04:41.300 --> 00:04:41.310 

00:04:41.310 --> 00:04:43.340 

of<00:04:41.550> course<00:04:41.910> I'm<00:04:42.090> shaking<00:04:42.480> out<00:04:42.630> the<00:04:42.810> glass<00:04:43.020> here

00:04:43.340 --> 00:04:43.350 
of course I'm shaking out the glass here

00:04:43.350 --> 00:04:53.290 
of course I'm shaking out the glass here
to<00:04:43.650> to<00:04:44.070> the<00:04:44.190> light<00:04:44.430> gray<00:04:44.820> stained<00:04:45.660> glass

00:04:53.290 --> 00:04:53.300 

00:04:53.300 --> 00:04:57.110 

so<00:04:54.300> the<00:04:54.479> glass<00:04:54.720> makes<00:04:55.289> this<00:04:55.590> field<00:04:55.949> so<00:04:56.550> much

00:04:57.110 --> 00:04:57.120 
so the glass makes this field so much

00:04:57.120 --> 00:05:00.409 
so the glass makes this field so much
better<00:04:57.660> it's<00:04:58.220> almost<00:04:59.220> unbelievable<00:04:59.580> how<00:05:00.270> much

00:05:00.409 --> 00:05:00.419 
better it's almost unbelievable how much

00:05:00.419 --> 00:05:03.740 
better it's almost unbelievable how much
better<00:05:00.750> it<00:05:00.900> looks<00:05:01.020> with<00:05:01.590> glass<00:05:02.009> and<00:05:02.539> it<00:05:03.539> took

00:05:03.740 --> 00:05:03.750 
better it looks with glass and it took

00:05:03.750 --> 00:05:06.650 
better it looks with glass and it took
me<00:05:03.960> a<00:05:03.990> while<00:05:04.169> to<00:05:04.229> build<00:05:04.530> this<00:05:04.830> so<00:05:05.250> I<00:05:05.639> was<00:05:06.240> really

00:05:06.650 --> 00:05:06.660 
me a while to build this so I was really

00:05:06.660 --> 00:05:09.260 
me a while to build this so I was really
i<00:05:07.080> didn't<00:05:08.009> like<00:05:08.160> to<00:05:08.190> build<00:05:08.550> during<00:05:09.030> the<00:05:09.120> whole

00:05:09.260 --> 00:05:09.270 
i didn't like to build during the whole

00:05:09.270 --> 00:05:12.620 
i didn't like to build during the whole
process<00:05:09.630> and<00:05:10.139> then<00:05:10.410> when<00:05:10.680> i<00:05:10.710> added

00:05:12.620 --> 00:05:12.630 
process and then when i added

00:05:12.630 --> 00:05:17.990 
process and then when i added
class<00:05:13.230> turned<00:05:14.160> out<00:05:14.340> to<00:05:14.520> be<00:05:14.870> so<00:05:15.870> much<00:05:17.000> better

00:05:17.990 --> 00:05:18.000 
class turned out to be so much better

00:05:18.000 --> 00:05:22.250 
class turned out to be so much better
than<00:05:18.270> I<00:05:18.420> expected<00:05:18.600> on<00:05:19.170> this<00:05:19.290> bill<00:05:20.960> as<00:05:21.960> you<00:05:22.110> can

00:05:22.250 --> 00:05:22.260 
than I expected on this bill as you can

00:05:22.260 --> 00:05:25.310 
than I expected on this bill as you can
see<00:05:22.410> now<00:05:22.680> under<00:05:23.210> the<00:05:24.210> scale<00:05:24.570> of<00:05:24.750> things<00:05:24.960> I

00:05:25.310 --> 00:05:25.320

00:05:31.010 --> 00:05:35.030 
think it looks quite good and it looks
really<00:05:32.010> close<00:05:33.000> to<00:05:33.420> what<00:05:33.600> it<00:05:33.750> looks<00:05:33.990> like<00:05:34.740> in

00:05:35.030 --> 00:05:35.040 
really close to what it looks like in
