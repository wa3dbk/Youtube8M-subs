00:00:37.069 --> 00:00:37.079 
announced at MWC so let's get right into

00:00:37.079 --> 00:00:37.729 
announced at MWC so let's get right into
it

00:00:37.729 --> 00:00:37.739 
it

00:00:37.739 --> 00:00:40.069 
it
first<00:00:38.070> off<00:00:38.280> same<00:00:38.730> screen<00:00:39.149> size<00:00:39.180> it's<00:00:39.750> a<00:00:39.870> 10

first off same screen size it's a 10
inch<00:00:40.230> display<00:00:40.410> so<00:00:40.739> it's<00:00:41.010> very<00:00:41.219> similar<00:00:41.579> to<00:00:42.059> the

00:00:42.470 --> 00:00:42.480 
inch display so it's very similar to the

00:00:42.480 --> 00:00:44.900 
inch display so it's very similar to the
z2<00:00:42.989> but<00:00:43.559> the<00:00:43.739> bezel<00:00:44.250> is<00:00:44.430> the<00:00:44.579> really<00:00:44.879> big

00:00:44.900 --> 00:00:44.910 
z2 but the bezel is the really big
