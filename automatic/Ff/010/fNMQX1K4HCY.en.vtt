00:00:15.350 --> 00:00:15.360 
there i didn't get the capture points

00:00:15.360 --> 00:00:16.970 
there i didn't get the capture points
for<00:00:15.450> a<00:00:15.480> which<00:00:15.870> are<00:00:16.049> equivalent<00:00:16.199> to<00:00:16.440> one<00:00:16.710> kill

00:00:16.970 --> 00:00:16.980 
for a which are equivalent to one kill

00:00:16.980 --> 00:00:19.279 
for a which are equivalent to one kill
because<00:00:17.789> when<00:00:18.150> capturing<00:00:18.510> a<00:00:18.600> home<00:00:18.750> base<00:00:18.960> thing

00:00:19.279 --> 00:00:19.289 
because when capturing a home base thing

00:00:19.289 --> 00:00:21.080 
because when capturing a home base thing
you<00:00:19.380> know<00:00:19.470> your<00:00:19.680> initial<00:00:20.070> flag<00:00:20.310> off<00:00:20.640> the<00:00:20.850> start

00:00:21.080 --> 00:00:21.090 
you know your initial flag off the start

00:00:21.090 --> 00:00:23.300 
you know your initial flag off the start
of<00:00:21.180> domination<00:00:21.600> is<00:00:21.720> only<00:00:21.840> worth<00:00:22.020> 50<00:00:22.289> points<00:00:22.320> so

00:00:23.300 --> 00:00:23.310 
of domination is only worth 50 points so

00:00:23.310 --> 00:00:25.009 
of domination is only worth 50 points so
it's<00:00:23.760> basically<00:00:23.939> equivalent<00:00:24.300> to<00:00:24.630> one<00:00:24.779> kill

00:00:25.009 --> 00:00:25.019 
it's basically equivalent to one kill

00:00:25.019 --> 00:00:27.380 
it's basically equivalent to one kill
and<00:00:25.050> i<00:00:25.230> just<00:00:25.380> got<00:00:25.529> for<00:00:25.710> those<00:00:25.949> right<00:00:26.160> there<00:00:26.390> so

00:00:27.380 --> 00:00:27.390 
and i just got for those right there so

00:00:27.390 --> 00:00:29.990 
and i just got for those right there so
you<00:00:27.480> know<00:00:27.660> missing<00:00:28.019> that<00:00:28.140> capture<00:00:28.880> isn't<00:00:29.880> too

00:00:29.990 --> 00:00:30.000 
you know missing that capture isn't too

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:31.759 
you know missing that capture isn't too
much<00:00:30.179> of<00:00:30.240> a<00:00:30.449> big<00:00:30.599> deal<00:00:30.630> you<00:00:30.929> know<00:00:31.019> it's<00:00:31.230> only<00:00:31.470> 50

00:00:31.759 --> 00:00:31.769 
much of a big deal you know it's only 50

00:00:31.769 --> 00:00:33.530 
much of a big deal you know it's only 50
points<00:00:32.130> and<00:00:32.309> i<00:00:32.369> think<00:00:32.640> you'll<00:00:32.759> get<00:00:32.880> by<00:00:33.059> but<00:00:33.420> it

00:00:33.530 --> 00:00:33.540 
points and i think you'll get by but it

00:00:33.540 --> 00:00:36.139 
points and i think you'll get by but it
does<00:00:33.690> help<00:00:33.840> a<00:00:33.960> little<00:00:34.110> bit<00:00:34.320> and<00:00:34.880> I'm<00:00:35.880> solo

good<00:02:05.520> submachine<00:02:05.939> gun<00:02:06.090> a<00:02:06.119> lot<00:02:06.390> of<00:02:06.479> people

00:02:06.679 --> 00:02:06.689 
good submachine gun a lot of people

00:02:06.689 --> 00:02:08.330 
good submachine gun a lot of people
refer<00:02:06.960> to<00:02:06.990> it<00:02:07.229> as<00:02:07.320> the<00:02:07.380> best<00:02:07.710> but<00:02:07.920> i<00:02:07.950> would<00:02:08.129> much

rather<00:02:08.369> use<00:02:08.759> a<00:02:08.789> vector<00:02:09.440> PDW<00:02:10.440> or<00:02:10.560> mp7<00:02:11.160> basically

00:02:11.540 --> 00:02:11.550 
rather use a vector PDW or mp7 basically

00:02:11.550 --> 00:02:12.170 
rather use a vector PDW or mp7 basically
any

00:02:12.170 --> 00:02:12.180

00:02:18.770 --> 00:02:18.780 
gun I mean it the better time machine

00:02:18.780 --> 00:02:20.300 
gun I mean it the better time machine
and<00:02:18.810> i<00:02:18.959> should<00:02:19.140> say<00:02:19.319> but<00:02:19.530> this<00:02:19.709> is<00:02:19.980> a<00:02:20.010> really

00:02:20.300 --> 00:02:20.310
