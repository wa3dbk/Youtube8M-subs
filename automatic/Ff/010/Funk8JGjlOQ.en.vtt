00:00:00.230 --> 00:00:05.480
 Talk to me, beauty, here I do not understand. 

00:00:02.960 --> 00:00:07.400
 This is one more video for you guys. 

00:00:05.480 --> 00:00:09.889
 Today I'll be bringing nothing more. 

00:00:07.400 --> 00:00:13.549
 less than my collection of games 

00:00:09.889 --> 00:00:22.189
 cube game here we start here 

00:00:13.549 --> 00:00:25.160
 this one is not the third is the 2005 

00:00:22.189 --> 00:00:27.679
 why do you look only when I bought the gamecube 

00:00:25.160 --> 00:00:28.460
 the seller on the free market took 

00:00:27.679 --> 00:00:30.949
 too much 

00:00:28.460 --> 00:00:34.610
 I find that he should not send the case 

00:00:30.949 --> 00:00:36.920
 it was only 99 but it took forever 

00:00:34.610 --> 00:00:39.680
 Even though it was late night, 

00:00:36.920 --> 00:00:42.469
 send a day after mossorÃ³ type of 

00:00:39.680 --> 00:00:45.050
 Friday until Tuesday to send and when 

00:00:42.469 --> 00:00:48.410
 they sign not to command that a game 

00:00:45.050 --> 00:00:52.699
 from toast then and arrived in the middle 

00:00:48.410 --> 00:00:58.129
 sleeping april law to the tce still very light 

00:00:52.699 --> 00:01:00.739
 that the president was even well is not a 

00:00:58.129 --> 00:01:04.460
 very low price then those games and 

00:01:00.739 --> 00:01:07.970
 20 reais to win, I got along 

00:01:04.460 --> 00:01:11.470
 Only when I went there did I even play tava. 

00:01:07.970 --> 00:01:14.060
 the enemy and 2005 

00:01:11.470 --> 00:01:18.680
 if they had sent me in the original box 

00:01:14.060 --> 00:01:23.450
 the game is happier but it is good for 

00:01:18.680 --> 00:01:27.190
 we are one more game here the next and did 

00:01:23.450 --> 00:01:27.190
 32 that I played a lot 

00:01:29.890 --> 00:01:42.260
 hence I saw this here in the cheap side shop 

00:01:34.690 --> 00:01:44.630
 I picked up with 30 that is not a new one and it's a lot 

00:01:42.260 --> 00:01:49.130
 good to get out of that same sameness 

00:01:44.630 --> 00:01:55.280
 piece that is only a move and kick 

00:01:49.130 --> 00:01:58.340
 goal that tom clancy's ghost recon I do not 

00:01:55.280 --> 00:02:01.060
 I got to play a lot because I did not 

00:01:58.340 --> 00:02:01.060
 really enjoyed 

00:02:01.850 --> 00:02:10.890
 in my party have to appear at 

00:02:04.170 --> 00:02:15.530
 run a free but is complete 

00:02:10.890 --> 00:02:19.020
 with the 20 real manual as fever sad 

00:02:15.530 --> 00:02:22.980
 see with his bad 

00:02:19.020 --> 00:02:30.170
 the game in good condition 

00:02:22.980 --> 00:02:30.170
 I did not go through any phase nor 

00:02:33.380 --> 00:02:40.320
 I got to play I played until a little 

00:02:36.480 --> 00:02:43.650
 in them I quite enjoyed a little just wanting 

00:02:40.320 --> 00:02:46.410
 as it is not a very cool game without saying 

00:02:43.650 --> 00:02:47.970
 is that it does not attract much focused playing 

00:02:46.410 --> 00:02:51.060
 playing playing only have nothing to 

00:02:47.970 --> 00:02:57.540
 do the same but also full 20 

00:02:51.060 --> 00:03:02.910
 the rest, not even the taste, and 

00:02:57.540 --> 00:03:06.450
 from here I bought new is the sticker there I 

00:03:02.910 --> 00:03:09.420
 I bought new in store had 15 games of 

00:03:06.450 --> 00:03:14.269
 game cube at the time i got this one 

00:03:09.420 --> 00:03:18.180
 It was R $ 20 new than Brazil. 

00:03:14.269 --> 00:03:20.519
 So I tried to remove the adhesive, but I did not 

00:03:18.180 --> 00:03:24.750
 It was very clear from my school that I came back 

00:03:20.519 --> 00:03:28.049
 This was not going to rip until here's pretty cool. 

00:03:24.750 --> 00:03:31.459
 zinho is that type of arcade game 

00:03:28.049 --> 00:03:36.120
 that's really cool 

00:03:31.459 --> 00:03:41.450
 good is new and complete is the brochure on 

00:03:36.120 --> 00:03:41.450
 Portuguese, I 'm going to take the game 

00:03:43.930 --> 00:03:48.219
 My first game here when I 

00:03:46.629 --> 00:03:51.219
 i bought 

00:03:48.219 --> 00:03:52.689
 I bought this game here and bought the 

00:03:51.219 --> 00:03:55.420
 emu control 

00:03:52.689 --> 00:03:57.209
 then after I bought the memory cade 

00:03:55.420 --> 00:04:05.379
 first clean game I played with 

00:03:57.209 --> 00:04:09.250
 so it's good it's not all that's good here 

00:04:05.379 --> 00:04:13.950
 The one without words for me is the best. 

00:04:09.250 --> 00:04:17.410
 gamecube game best everything beautiful thing 

00:04:13.950 --> 00:04:20.799
 because besides zelda zeal everybody 

00:04:17.410 --> 00:04:25.599
 doses is the last game he has these 

00:04:20.799 --> 00:04:27.220
 nice legal graphics was not 

00:04:25.599 --> 00:04:31.090
 too far away but I'm playing 

00:04:27.220 --> 00:04:33.639
 I'm still to turn and here's more 

00:04:31.090 --> 00:04:36.669
 It's easy for you to go boating so everything. 

00:04:33.639 --> 00:04:40.360
 graphic medium draw very cool 

00:04:36.669 --> 00:04:42.580
 pity that does not come with November a new 

00:04:40.360 --> 00:04:48.210
 harvest 

00:04:42.580 --> 00:04:52.150
 the game bought my pen a good price 

00:04:48.210 --> 00:04:56.229
 well below the average price you are 

00:04:52.150 --> 00:04:59.860
 look for the 169 manual out there 

00:04:56.229 --> 00:05:03.010
 150 but this is what I paid for - seventy 

00:04:59.860 --> 00:05:05.340
 real however it was very good price i 

00:05:03.010 --> 00:05:05.340
 liked it 

00:05:05.380 --> 00:05:12.490
 and last but not least and 

00:05:09.159 --> 00:05:13.060
 yes surely important super smash 

00:05:12.490 --> 00:05:19.509
 bros 

00:05:13.060 --> 00:05:23.770
 emily is a game that has every character 

00:05:19.509 --> 00:05:25.810
 nintendo as you all should know is 

00:05:23.770 --> 00:05:27.970
 a very good fighting game that I like 

00:05:25.810 --> 00:05:29.590
 of it is that most of the fighting games 

00:05:27.970 --> 00:05:32.470
 name of the man I can not play 

00:05:29.590 --> 00:05:35.199
 very well the games and a goal but with you 

00:05:32.470 --> 00:05:38.440
 It's from here and then we do because it 's 

00:05:35.199 --> 00:05:43.409
 this one you do not have to take the whole 

00:05:38.440 --> 00:05:43.409
 opponent's income is weakening 

00:05:43.560 --> 00:05:49.870
 played it out or any other way 

00:05:47.680 --> 00:05:51.699
 cool game you have to play with 

00:05:49.870 --> 00:05:53.980
 people out going touching the attack 

00:05:51.699 --> 00:05:56.470
 taking things 

00:05:53.980 --> 00:06:01.650
 ps who are joyce players does not matter 

00:05:56.470 --> 00:06:01.650

00:06:15.160 --> 00:06:27.420
