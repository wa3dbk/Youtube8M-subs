00:01:55.639 --> 00:01:55.649 
awesome actually and all basically I all

00:01:55.649 --> 00:01:57.919 
awesome actually and all basically I all
new<00:01:55.920> sculpt<00:01:56.789> as<00:01:57.030> far<00:01:57.329> as<00:01:57.420> the<00:01:57.509> body<00:01:57.749> and

00:02:04.819 --> 00:02:04.829 
think that's I guess that sends for like

00:02:04.829 --> 00:02:07.309 
think that's I guess that sends for like
wolf<00:02:05.069> pack<00:02:05.340> right<00:02:05.579> there<00:02:05.850> or<00:02:06.179> I<00:02:06.509> yeah<00:02:07.079> his
