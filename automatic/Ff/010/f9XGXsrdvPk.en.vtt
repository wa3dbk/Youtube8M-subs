00:00:49.549 --> 00:00:49.559 
I believe some trader joes might have a

00:00:49.559 --> 00:00:51.979 
I believe some trader joes might have a
2<00:00:49.860> and<00:00:50.160> this<00:00:50.489> is<00:00:50.640> about<00:00:50.820> eight<00:00:51.120> dollars<00:00:51.780> i

00:00:51.979 --> 00:00:51.989 
2 and this is about eight dollars i

think<00:00:52.280> it<00:00:53.280> lasts<00:00:53.579> a<00:00:53.610> pretty<00:00:53.789> long<00:00:53.940> time<00:00:54.000> it's

00:00:54.500 --> 00:00:54.510 
think it lasts a pretty long time it's

00:00:54.510 --> 00:00:56.060 
think it lasts a pretty long time it's
worth<00:00:54.690> it<00:00:54.809> for<00:00:54.989> a<00:00:55.050> body<00:00:55.230> wash<00:00:55.410> especially<00:00:56.010> if
