00:00:36.559 --> 00:00:41.700

00:00:47.460 --> 00:00:52.710
 in the crusaders 

00:00:48.750 --> 00:00:56.660

00:00:52.710 --> 00:00:59.969

00:01:12.950 --> 00:01:19.000
 in my best class 

00:01:15.950 --> 00:01:21.020
 maybe what trouble because we give 

00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:27.409
 cancellation dogs this should not 

00:01:21.020 --> 00:01:29.689
 be bad but why eat on a sheet 

00:01:27.409 --> 00:01:37.270
 these ascending fragments I wonder 

00:01:29.689 --> 00:01:37.270

00:01:37.390 --> 00:01:43.850

 the party that could not tiboni st 5 

00:01:52.159 --> 00:01:58.159

00:01:54.319 --> 00:02:00.409

00:02:14.239 --> 00:02:22.819
 spread that use of just that 

00:02:16.670 --> 00:02:25.519

00:02:22.819 --> 00:02:30.670
 perk was not on my side 

00:02:25.519 --> 00:02:30.670

00:02:31.269 --> 00:02:38.770

00:02:34.190 --> 00:02:42.520
