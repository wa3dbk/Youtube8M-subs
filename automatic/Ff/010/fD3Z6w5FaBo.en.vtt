00:00:01.810 --> 00:00:07.359
 I love decorating the Christmas tree 

00:00:04.660 --> 00:00:10.600
 feel like a girl we had to 

00:00:07.359 --> 00:00:12.760
 tree when I was a child seriously because in 

00:00:10.600 --> 00:00:14.350
 my family the holidays are not 

00:00:12.760 --> 00:00:15.940
 they celebrated because they studied for their 

00:00:14.350 --> 00:00:18.310
 anthropological implications and 

00:00:15.940 --> 00:00:20.920
 physiological need 

00:00:18.310 --> 00:00:26.310
 today what fun and if they gave you the 

00:00:20.920 --> 00:00:26.310
 made somehow put us evidence 

00:00:26.510 --> 00:00:30.980
 and we make critical groups and we 

00:00:28.520 --> 00:00:34.960
 criticize let's go ugly 

00:00:30.980 --> 00:00:34.960
 with you if you had a Christmas tree 

00:00:36.329 --> 00:00:41.370
 Of course it was a pine and a 

00:00:38.909 --> 00:00:43.240
 inflatable santaclaves with plastic reindeers 

00:00:41.370 --> 00:00:44.980
 in the garden 

00:00:43.240 --> 00:00:46.840
 so that it was more cheerful there were lights 

00:00:44.980 --> 00:00:49.720
 intermittent in the house that caused 

00:00:46.840 --> 00:00:51.850
 excessive expenses in the payment of electricity 

00:00:49.720 --> 00:00:55.240
 you do not want to decorate the tree with us 

00:00:51.850 --> 00:00:57.070
 not me not but if they insist on decorating a 

00:00:55.240 --> 00:01:01.540
 flammable tree and full of spiders in my 

00:00:57.070 --> 00:01:05.950
 house I need you to add this and that 

00:01:01.540 --> 00:01:08.580
 what is truth there is the bust of 

00:01:05.950 --> 00:01:08.580
 sir isaac newton 

00:01:09.240 --> 00:01:14.189
 Of course it has to do with Christmas 

00:01:11.329 --> 00:01:18.070
 excuse me but it's more Christmas than the 

00:01:14.189 --> 00:01:21.490
 you wait that they put on the tree again 

00:01:18.070 --> 00:01:24.220
 December 25 1642 Julian calendar Sir 

00:01:21.490 --> 00:01:25.960
 Isaac Newton was born Jesus on the other hand 

00:01:24.220 --> 00:01:27.790
 actually he was born in summer and his 

00:01:25.960 --> 00:01:29.170
 Birthday changed to match 

00:01:27.790 --> 00:01:31.119
 traditional pagan festivals that 

00:01:29.170 --> 00:01:33.630
 celebrate the winter solstice with 

00:01:31.119 --> 00:01:35.430
 bonfires and sacrifice of goats 

00:01:33.630 --> 00:01:36.990
 the truth is more pleasant I am sure 

00:01:35.430 --> 00:01:38.710
 without the church with my mother and the ladies 

00:01:36.990 --> 00:01:42.790
 of perpetual life 

00:01:38.710 --> 00:01:46.619
 merry christmas to all I feel that it is not 

00:01:42.790 --> 00:01:46.619
 sincere although I have no idea why 

00:01:49.660 --> 00:01:56.630
 up on the tree that I do not understand 

00:01:54.860 --> 00:01:58.520
 disputes that he said he invented the 

00:01:56.630 --> 00:02:01.040
 calculation if you want to put the court 

00:01:58.520 --> 00:02:02.740
 triplay nits up 

00:02:01.040 --> 00:02:05.570
 well it's true I'm leibniz man 

00:02:02.740 --> 00:02:08.930
 Well, maybe when your mother arrives you 

00:02:05.570 --> 00:02:11.140
 you force irrational that your mother comes 

00:02:08.930 --> 00:02:11.140
 when
