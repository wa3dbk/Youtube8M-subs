00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:17.500
XG8 function

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:20.500
Curve the copy

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:24.000
First of all, “Curve” can be copied, especially “Throttle Curve”.

00:00:24.500 --> 00:00:27.000
By setting Idleup first or Ideleup second, 

00:00:27.500 --> 00:00:30.500
you can easily copy the complicated curve with one button. 

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:34.500
Set the point

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:41.000
Next, you can intuitively set the point of the curve with not only Jog dial 

00:00:41.500 --> 00:00:46.500
but also moving up and down the stick. 

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:53.000
You can set the point with the stick loosely first and then 

00:00:53.500 --> 00:00:58.500
adjust with the dial precisely. 

00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:01.500
Telemetry

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:05.000
Telemetry system is already equipped, 

00:01:05.500 --> 00:01:10.500
so the attractive point is you can check information of a flying helicopter 

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:15.000
from Propo only with equipping the sensor.

00:01:15.500 --> 00:01:18.000
Trim input switch

00:01:18.500 --> 00:01:23.000
Trim input switch is my most favorite function.

00:01:23.500 --> 00:01:28.500
You can optimally adjust the rotation checking the indicator 

00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:33.500
by using the rudder trim to adjust the gyro sensitivity 

00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:39.500
and the throttle trim as the key to change the rotation of the governor.

00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:46.000
Stick alert

00:01:46.500 --> 00:01:50.500
Stick alert is very useful function when practicing F3C.

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:55.000
It can alert at random throttle stick position.

00:01:55.500 --> 00:01:59.500
The most-used one is setting Zero pitch at the middle of stick 

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:04.000
and it will alert you when the stick pass the middle.

00:02:04.500 --> 00:02:08.500
On Cubean-eight flying, it is ideal to role at Zero pitch, 

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:14.000
so it is effective practice way because you can acknowledge 

00:02:14.500 --> 00:02:18.500
Zero pitch when operating. 

00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:23.000
On 3D flying, you can know how it works

00:02:23.500 --> 00:02:27.500
when steering around Zero pitch, 

00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:33.000
so you can know how it increased or decreased 

00:02:33.500 --> 00:02:39.000
when adjusting the stick position..

00:02:39.500 --> 00:02:42.500
E-ring function

00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:46.000
On 3D flying, it is very handy to control the Aileron and elevator evenly 

00:02:46.500 --> 00:02:49.000
when you make a maneuver like pirouette flip, 

00:02:49.500 --> 00:02:52.000
this is the function to move the swash plate 

00:02:52.500 --> 00:02:55.000
without giving precise control on stick gimbals.

00:02:55.500 --> 00:02:58.500
The setting can be check by graphic display so it is very easy to adjust.  

00:02:59.000 --> 00:03:02.000
Development

00:03:02.500 --> 00:03:10.500
I was asked for advice by engineer and I told the most important thing is

00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:18.000
how fast it can be adjusted and the second one is fulfilling function.

00:03:18.500 --> 00:03:25.000
I asked him to include the high use function 

00:03:25.500 --> 00:03:32.000
which is generally included in a high-end Propo.

00:03:32.500 --> 00:03:39.500
I think enough function is included in XG8 even for Japan Championship level.

00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:46.500
The function I introduced here is a small portion. XG8 have tons of function and is easy to use.  Please try JR XG8.
