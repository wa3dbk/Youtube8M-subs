these<00:07:02.090> rolls<00:07:02.390> pretty<00:07:02.690> good<00:07:02.960> I<00:07:03.580> noticed<00:07:04.580> if<00:07:04.760> you

00:07:04.990 --> 00:07:05.000 
these rolls pretty good I noticed if you

00:07:05.000 --> 00:07:08.950 
these rolls pretty good I noticed if you
don't<00:07:05.210> make<00:07:05.810> the<00:07:06.020> batch<00:07:06.430> too<00:07:07.430> thin<00:07:07.780> they<00:07:08.780> will

00:07:08.950 --> 00:07:08.960 
don't make the batch too thin they will

00:07:08.960 --> 00:07:12.400 
don't make the batch too thin they will
rise<00:07:09.140> higher<00:07:09.850> that's<00:07:10.850> what<00:07:11.030> I've<00:07:11.150> noticed<00:07:11.410> if

00:07:12.400 --> 00:07:12.410 
rise higher that's what I've noticed if

00:07:12.410 --> 00:07:15.370 
rise higher that's what I've noticed if
you<00:07:12.740> don't<00:07:12.920> want<00:07:13.190> them<00:07:13.430> to<00:07:13.550> rise<00:07:13.760> higher<00:07:14.380> then

00:07:15.370 --> 00:07:15.380 
you don't want them to rise higher then

00:07:15.380 --> 00:07:16.630 
you don't want them to rise higher then
you<00:07:15.590> can<00:07:15.740> put<00:07:15.920> a<00:07:15.950> little<00:07:16.100> more<00:07:16.220> liquid<00:07:16.430> in

00:07:16.630 --> 00:07:16.640 
you can put a little more liquid in

00:07:16.640 --> 00:07:19.660 
you can put a little more liquid in
there<00:07:16.820> but<00:07:17.330> the<00:07:17.450> thicker<00:07:17.720> the<00:07:18.020> batch<00:07:18.670> the
