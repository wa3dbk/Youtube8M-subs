00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.000
 hello today we are testing 

00:00:02.330 --> 00:00:09.570
 DVR cross 500 hd night 

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:12.530
 in the dark here we break a little bit 

00:00:09.570 --> 00:00:12.530
 cross the pistons 

00:00:19.730 --> 00:00:23.539
 as we see the picture is good enough 

00:00:21.650 --> 00:00:26.199
 video recorder takes off at night 

00:00:23.539 --> 00:00:28.310
 the mode is good enough 

00:00:26.199 --> 00:00:32.329
 the peculiarity of him is that he 

00:00:28.310 --> 00:00:34.910
 cheap and full night shooting he 

00:00:32.329 --> 00:00:37.989
 one night short shot 

00:00:34.910 --> 00:00:40.570
 the power buttons turn on quite easily 

00:00:37.989 --> 00:00:43.449
 driving along the road with four lanes 

00:00:40.570 --> 00:00:46.760
 lit quite good 

00:00:43.449 --> 00:00:48.470
 card use micro sd 10 class 

00:00:46.760 --> 00:00:51.699
 therefore it is recommended to use 

00:00:48.470 --> 00:00:51.699
 such cards 

00:00:57.820 --> 00:01:01.530
 we see the night lights are on 

00:00:59.410 --> 00:01:03.970
 can distinguish try like this 

00:01:01.530 --> 00:01:06.250
 Basically nothing changes but if you 

00:01:03.970 --> 00:01:08.110
 closer then look closer to the car then you 

00:01:06.250 --> 00:01:11.170
 see numbers now my loyalty 

00:01:08.110 --> 00:01:13.869
 here is this route as an attack pushes us 

00:01:11.170 --> 00:01:14.550
 we can see rooms now enough 

00:01:13.869 --> 00:01:17.740
 not bad 

00:01:14.550 --> 00:01:19.600
 as for registrars priced at about 600 

00:01:17.740 --> 00:01:21.090
 hryvnia depending on which 

00:01:19.600 --> 00:01:23.159
 shop buy 

00:01:21.090 --> 00:01:25.320
 that's how you see if the object is close 

00:01:23.159 --> 00:01:27.179
 starting backlighting really helps 

00:01:25.320 --> 00:01:29.360
 get up and go to the speed of the country 

00:01:27.179 --> 00:01:30.590
 rule 

00:01:29.360 --> 00:01:33.140
 so 

00:01:30.590 --> 00:01:36.590
 quite good as I think is considered 

00:01:33.140 --> 00:01:38.600
 this shot now we hit the plot 

00:01:36.590 --> 00:01:40.520
 which is generally very poorly lit 

00:01:38.600 --> 00:01:43.579
 just see the building next to which 

00:01:40.520 --> 00:01:45.530
 illuminate and traffic lights traffic lights as we 

00:01:43.579 --> 00:01:49.700
 already saw this green light well 

00:01:45.530 --> 00:01:51.740
 see below we do not have any lights at all 

00:01:49.700 --> 00:01:54.679
 which light up the road we drive just and 

00:01:51.740 --> 00:01:56.990
 I look at all like what what where is needed 

00:01:54.679 --> 00:01:58.620
 we just have to touch say this 

00:01:56.990 --> 00:02:04.510
 what business or 

00:01:58.620 --> 00:02:07.950
 crawled out could it be a nightmare here 

00:02:04.510 --> 00:02:10.180
 Now here we see the car next to us 

00:02:07.950 --> 00:02:14.440
 ordinary patient should help him 

00:02:10.180 --> 00:02:18.310
 highlight here we highlighted and saw 

00:02:14.440 --> 00:02:22.180
 Excellent rooms are great for time 10 

00:02:18.310 --> 00:02:28.050
 hours unfortunately forgot to set the time 

00:02:22.180 --> 00:02:31.960
 Well fret 10 hours 23 0 7 2013 

00:02:28.050 --> 00:02:34.030
 as seen well lit road like 

00:02:31.960 --> 00:02:36.130
 we see three cars we can see us yet 

00:02:34.030 --> 00:02:39.220
 a little visible fourth strip of what 

00:02:36.130 --> 00:02:39.880
 says a good viewing angle lens in this 

00:02:39.220 --> 00:02:42.550
 the registrar 

00:02:39.880 --> 00:02:47.340
 quite good here we see sports 

00:02:42.550 --> 00:02:47.340
 the racer is generally well rooted 

00:02:47.850 --> 00:02:52.460
 but than 

00:02:49.850 --> 00:02:54.800
 road conditions and shooting quality 

00:02:52.460 --> 00:02:58.420
 video recorder we have already appreciated this 

00:02:54.800 --> 00:02:58.420
 Thank you all for your attention
