00:00:09.380 --> 00:00:14.730
 hello everyone in this video I do 

00:00:11.940 --> 00:00:17.369
 see a recipe for a first course 

00:00:14.730 --> 00:00:18.029
 really delicious and very easy to 

00:00:17.369 --> 00:00:19.500
 prepare 

00:00:18.029 --> 00:00:22.609
 it's about the puttanesca boy 

00:00:19.500 --> 00:00:25.080
 done in a version not really 

00:00:22.609 --> 00:00:27.269
 very traditional because we will go to 

00:00:25.080 --> 00:00:28.830
 add some ingredients like i 

00:00:27.269 --> 00:00:30.900
 dried tomatoes than in the version 

00:00:28.830 --> 00:00:33.600
 original there are not but there are 

00:00:30.900 --> 00:00:36.270
 really great and we hope so much that 

00:00:33.600 --> 00:00:38.640
 this is another idea of ​​ours 

00:00:36.270 --> 00:00:40.770
 version may like me and I'll do it 

00:00:38.640 --> 00:00:42.719
 see stupid how to do the first one 

00:00:40.770 --> 00:00:45.239
 passage that we are going to do that of 

00:00:42.719 --> 00:00:48.800
 put some hot water in the 

00:00:45.239 --> 00:00:52.680
 hats and tomatoes 

00:00:48.800 --> 00:00:55.230
 in this way we will help to distract them ok 

00:00:52.680 --> 00:00:57.960
 now we can prepare ours 

00:00:55.230 --> 00:01:01.559
 subject then we cut into four i 

00:00:57.960 --> 00:01:03.960
 we chose this type of tomatoes 

00:01:01.559 --> 00:01:06.390
 but the cherry can be used 

00:01:03.960 --> 00:01:08.880
 even the tomatoes those from the sauce 

00:01:06.390 --> 00:01:11.780
 those a little bigger now there 

00:01:08.880 --> 00:01:11.780
 we put in the pan 

00:01:13.620 --> 00:01:17.940
 we also put 12 cloves of garlic 

00:01:15.780 --> 00:01:20.630
 in shirt and a few pieces of 

00:01:17.940 --> 00:01:20.630
 chili pepper 

00:01:21.840 --> 00:01:26.520
 we add a nice circle of oil and 

00:01:23.850 --> 00:01:28.940
 let them pass on a stretcher 

00:01:26.520 --> 00:01:30.990
 our tomatoes with chilli garlic 

00:01:28.940 --> 00:01:32.580
 we can wither now 

00:01:30.990 --> 00:01:35.070
 add the rest of the ingredients 

00:01:32.580 --> 00:01:38.190
 first let's go rattle off 

00:01:35.070 --> 00:01:41.670
 our universities are also olives 

00:01:38.190 --> 00:01:44.340
 taggiasche those pitted there are 

00:01:41.670 --> 00:01:46.830
 well even those baked apples 

00:01:44.340 --> 00:01:48.990
 we also believe our dried tomatoes 

00:01:46.830 --> 00:01:51.570
 that we have wrung you to 

00:01:48.990 --> 00:01:54.360
 small small pieces small dried tomatoes 

00:01:51.570 --> 00:01:56.760
 they will find an extra gear to the 

00:01:54.360 --> 00:01:59.160
 easter are very tasty as 

00:01:56.760 --> 00:02:01.770
 fragrant and in my opinion there really are 

00:01:59.160 --> 00:02:04.110
 well we add everything to ours 

00:02:01.770 --> 00:02:06.300
 fresh tomatoes as you see not yet 

00:02:04.110 --> 00:02:09.000
 we added salt because I hear you say 

00:02:06.300 --> 00:02:12.060
 that the facts the tomatoes are lowered 

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:14.880
 tasty so now mix the balls 

00:02:12.060 --> 00:02:18.620
 and we will taste it if we need some 

00:02:14.880 --> 00:02:18.620
 healthy we reach otherwise 

00:02:19.280 --> 00:02:23.540
 at this point our sauce 

00:02:21.250 --> 00:02:25.459
 practically ready we will have to 

00:02:23.540 --> 00:02:28.959
 simply sauté the pasta in it 

00:02:25.459 --> 00:02:28.959
 so we immediately threw it away 

00:02:29.170 --> 00:02:33.410
 we have drained our spaghetti e 

00:02:31.610 --> 00:02:38.110
 towards we can add them to 

00:02:33.410 --> 00:02:38.110
 I add even a little bit of dressing 

00:02:41.160 --> 00:02:43.960
 add a little bit of water 

00:02:43.330 --> 00:02:46.750
 cooking 

00:02:43.960 --> 00:02:49.200
 in this way we will help to tie everything 

00:02:46.750 --> 00:02:49.200
 how much 

00:02:57.900 --> 00:03:03.959

00:03:00.959 --> 00:03:03.959

00:03:07.600 --> 00:03:12.940
 our pasta alla puttanesca is ready 

00:03:10.180 --> 00:03:14.860
 as you can see really simple from 

00:03:12.940 --> 00:03:17.620
 prepare and I would say that pretty 

00:03:14.860 --> 00:03:19.720
 fast does not take too long 

00:03:17.620 --> 00:03:21.970

00:03:19.720 --> 00:03:24.040
