00:02:57.560 --> 00:02:59.880 
discovered these cotton rounds months
ago<00:02:57.830> and<00:02:58.070> they<00:02:58.610> are<00:02:58.820> awesome<00:02:59.030> they're<00:02:59.420> at<00:02:59.570> the

exfoliating cotton rounds from target

00:03:02.450 --> 00:03:05.110 
exfoliating cotton rounds from target
and<00:03:02.750> so<00:03:03.560> it<00:03:03.950> looks<00:03:04.160> like<00:03:04.250> a<00:03:04.340> normal<00:03:04.550> cotton

00:03:17.920 --> 00:03:17.930 
steps like you think there would be no

no dirt or anything left on my skin I

00:03:20.030 --> 00:03:23.620 
no dirt or anything left on my skin I
can<00:03:20.330> always<00:03:20.480> get<00:03:20.810> more<00:03:21.160> using<00:03:22.160> this<00:03:22.310> so<00:03:22.610> i<00:03:22.790> use

00:03:23.620 --> 00:03:23.630 
can always get more using this so i use

00:03:23.630 --> 00:03:26.320 
can always get more using this so i use
the<00:03:23.840> bumpy<00:03:24.230> side<00:03:24.410> and<00:03:24.860> i<00:03:25.340> just<00:03:25.730> go<00:03:25.910> around<00:03:26.060> my

00:03:26.320 --> 00:03:26.330 
the bumpy side and i just go around my

00:03:26.330 --> 00:03:30.280 
the bumpy side and i just go around my
whole<00:03:26.570> face<00:03:26.870> until<00:03:27.440> the<00:03:27.860> cotton<00:03:28.190> pad<00:03:28.400> is<00:03:29.290> clean

00:03:30.280 --> 00:03:30.290 
whole face until the cotton pad is clean

00:03:30.290 --> 00:03:33.400 
whole face until the cotton pad is clean
so<00:03:30.580> usually<00:03:31.580> I<00:03:31.610> use<00:03:31.670> like<00:03:32.060> one<00:03:32.330> or<00:03:33.019> two<00:03:33.049> of
