over a period of time you'll probably

00:00:04.170 --> 00:00:05.960 
over a period of time you'll probably
find<00:00:04.500> your<00:00:04.710> heavy<00:00:04.859> mates<00:00:05.069> erratic<00:00:05.520> movements

00:00:05.960 --> 00:00:05.970 
find your heavy mates erratic movements

find your heavy mates erratic movements
in<00:00:06.120> flight<00:00:06.420> this<00:00:07.379> is<00:00:07.440> most<00:00:07.799> noticeable<00:00:08.130> on<00:00:08.460> the

00:00:08.540 --> 00:00:08.550 
in flight this is most noticeable on the

00:00:08.550 --> 00:00:12.140 
in flight this is most noticeable on the
tail<00:00:08.929> instead<00:00:09.929> of<00:00:10.080> smooth<00:00:10.440> tones<00:00:10.889> the<00:00:11.880> tower

will<00:00:12.330> jerk

00:00:12.950 --> 00:00:12.960 
will jerk

00:00:12.960 --> 00:00:16.700 
will jerk
and<00:00:13.710> these<00:00:13.830> are<00:00:13.980> what<00:00:14.099> we<00:00:14.190> call<00:00:14.330> glitches<00:00:15.710> and

00:00:16.700 --> 00:00:16.710 
and these are what we call glitches and

00:00:16.710 --> 00:00:18.490 
and these are what we call glitches and
one<00:00:16.830> of<00:00:16.920> the<00:00:16.980> major<00:00:17.100> causes<00:00:17.400> of<00:00:17.670> glitches<00:00:17.910> are

00:00:18.490 --> 00:00:18.500 
one of the major causes of glitches are

00:00:18.500 --> 00:00:23.179 
one of the major causes of glitches are
dirty<00:00:19.640> potentiometers<00:00:21.680> we<00:00:22.680> call<00:00:22.859> them<00:00:22.949> pots

00:00:23.179 --> 00:00:23.189 
dirty potentiometers we call them pots

00:00:23.189 --> 00:00:30.080 
dirty potentiometers we call them pots
vishal<00:00:26.150> they're<00:00:27.150> easy<00:00:27.330> to<00:00:27.510> clean<00:00:28.910> first<00:00:29.910> thing

out this little ring here when you're
trying<00:00:41.040> a<00:00:41.190> switch<00:00:42.559> and<00:00:43.559> then<00:00:43.739> we<00:00:43.800> can<00:00:44.600> open<00:00:45.600> up

00:00:45.830 --> 00:00:45.840 
trying a switch and then we can open up

00:00:45.840 --> 00:00:49.010 
trying a switch and then we can open up
the<00:00:45.960> case<00:00:47.180> now<00:00:48.180> you'll<00:00:48.329> also<00:00:48.450> have<00:00:48.629> this<00:00:48.809> lead

00:00:49.010 --> 00:00:49.020 
the case now you'll also have this lead

00:00:49.020 --> 00:00:52.040 
the case now you'll also have this lead
here<00:00:49.260> which<00:00:49.410> is<00:00:49.559> your<00:00:49.680> battery<00:00:50.010> lead<00:00:50.870> which<00:00:51.870> we

00:00:52.040 --> 00:00:52.050 
here which is your battery lead which we

00:00:52.050 --> 00:00:56.029 
here which is your battery lead which we
plugged<00:00:52.350> in<00:00:52.559> on<00:00:53.370> here<00:00:53.820> on<00:00:53.940> your<00:00:54.090> circuit<00:00:55.039> so

these little silver things here now to

00:01:21.930 --> 00:01:23.749 
these little silver things here now to
clean<00:01:22.259> them<00:01:22.439> what<00:01:22.619> you<00:01:22.710> need<00:01:22.830> is<00:01:23.040> something

00:01:23.749 --> 00:01:23.759 
clean them what you need is something

00:01:23.759 --> 00:01:26.660 
clean them what you need is something
like<00:01:23.939> a<00:01:23.970> contact<00:01:24.509> cleaner<00:01:24.750> spray<00:01:25.490> don't<00:01:26.490> use

00:01:26.660 --> 00:01:26.670 
like a contact cleaner spray don't use

00:01:26.670 --> 00:01:29.480 
like a contact cleaner spray don't use
wd-40<00:01:27.360> because<00:01:27.869> that<00:01:28.049> isn't<00:01:28.860> good<00:01:28.979> to<00:01:29.009> plastic

00:01:29.480 --> 00:01:29.490 
wd-40 because that isn't good to plastic

00:01:29.490 --> 00:01:31.429 
wd-40 because that isn't good to plastic
and<00:01:29.610> it<00:01:29.670> will<00:01:29.700> melt<00:01:29.939> it<00:01:30.180> soften<00:01:30.900> the<00:01:30.960> plastic

00:01:31.429 --> 00:01:31.439 
and it will melt it soften the plastic

00:01:31.439 --> 00:01:33.740 
and it will melt it soften the plastic
so<00:01:32.310> you<00:01:32.369> need<00:01:32.610> I've<00:01:32.880> got<00:01:33.030> mine<00:01:33.180> format<00:01:33.509> pins

00:01:33.740 --> 00:01:33.750 
so you need I've got mine format pins

00:01:33.750 --> 00:01:35.359 
so you need I've got mine format pins
which<00:01:33.930> is<00:01:34.079> a<00:01:34.110> contact<00:01:34.500> cleaner<00:01:34.740> but<00:01:35.159> make<00:01:35.340> sure

00:01:35.359 --> 00:01:35.369 
which is a contact cleaner but make sure

00:01:35.369 --> 00:01:39.800 
which is a contact cleaner but make sure
that<00:01:35.909> it's<00:01:36.060> safe<00:01:36.240> to<00:01:36.450> use<00:01:36.659> on<00:01:36.930> plastic<00:01:38.810> what

00:01:39.800 --> 00:01:39.810 
that it's safe to use on plastic what

00:01:39.810 --> 00:01:44.690 
that it's safe to use on plastic what
you<00:01:39.900> need<00:01:40.020> to<00:01:40.140> do<00:01:40.290> is<00:01:40.790> get<00:01:41.790> the<00:01:41.909> spray<00:01:43.399> right<00:01:44.399> in

00:01:44.690 --> 00:01:44.700 
you need to do is get the spray right in

00:01:44.700 --> 00:01:48.560 
you need to do is get the spray right in
here<00:01:45.090> this<00:01:45.720> little<00:01:45.990> opening<00:01:46.350> here<00:01:47.420> you<00:01:48.420> want

00:01:48.560 --> 00:01:48.570 
here this little opening here you want

00:01:48.570 --> 00:01:54.950 
here this little opening here you want
to<00:01:48.630> put<00:01:48.720> a<00:01:49.220> spray<00:01:50.220> in<00:01:50.399> there<00:01:51.649> turn<00:01:52.649> round<00:01:53.960> get

00:01:54.950 --> 00:01:54.960 
to put a spray in there turn round get

00:01:54.960 --> 00:01:57.410 
to put a spray in there turn round get
one<00:01:55.110> into<00:01:55.350> here<00:01:55.820> it's<00:01:56.820> a<00:01:56.880> bit<00:01:57.030> harder<00:01:57.299> to<00:01:57.329> find

00:01:57.410 --> 00:01:57.420 
one into here it's a bit harder to find

00:01:57.420 --> 00:02:00.920 
one into here it's a bit harder to find
on<00:01:57.780> this<00:01:57.869> one<00:01:58.110> if<00:01:58.530> we<00:01:58.649> turn<00:01:58.860> it<00:01:58.890> round<00:01:59.930> and

00:02:00.920 --> 00:02:00.930 
on this one if we turn it round and

00:02:00.930 --> 00:02:03.469 
on this one if we turn it round and
probably<00:02:01.229> see<00:02:01.729> there's<00:02:02.729> the<00:02:02.909> open<00:02:03.149> on<00:02:03.270> this

00:02:03.469 --> 00:02:03.479 
probably see there's the open on this

00:02:03.479 --> 00:02:08.290 
probably see there's the open on this
one<00:02:04.729> so<00:02:05.729> quick<00:02:06.450> spurt<00:02:06.869> the<00:02:07.049> spray<00:02:07.380> in<00:02:07.439> there

00:02:08.290 --> 00:02:08.300 
one so quick spurt the spray in there

00:02:08.300 --> 00:02:12.100 
one so quick spurt the spray in there
and<00:02:09.300> then<00:02:09.450> just<00:02:09.690> move<00:02:10.410> your<00:02:10.560> sticks<00:02:10.830> around

00:02:12.100 --> 00:02:12.110 
and then just move your sticks around

00:02:12.110 --> 00:02:14.990 
and then just move your sticks around
clean<00:02:13.110> them<00:02:13.230> up<00:02:13.319> and<00:02:13.709> I<00:02:14.310> normally<00:02:14.489> put<00:02:14.849> in

00:02:14.990 --> 00:02:15.000 
clean them up and I normally put in

00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:18.170 
clean them up and I normally put in
another<00:02:15.870> quick<00:02:16.140> spray<00:02:16.470> in<00:02:16.590> each<00:02:17.030> move<00:02:18.030> it

00:02:18.170 --> 00:02:18.180 
another quick spray in each move it

00:02:18.180 --> 00:02:20.089 
another quick spray in each move it
around<00:02:18.270> again<00:02:18.540> just<00:02:19.440> about<00:02:19.560> sort<00:02:19.830> of<00:02:19.860> 20

00:02:20.089 --> 00:02:20.099 
around again just about sort of 20

00:02:20.099 --> 00:02:23.720 
around again just about sort of 20
seconds<00:02:20.580> move<00:02:21.090> it<00:02:21.270> around<00:02:21.980> and<00:02:22.980> then<00:02:23.489> do<00:02:23.610> the

00:02:23.720 --> 00:02:23.730 
seconds move it around and then do the

00:02:23.730 --> 00:02:30.170 
seconds move it around and then do the
same<00:02:23.940> on<00:02:24.239> these<00:02:24.959> other<00:02:25.170> two<00:02:28.370> if<00:02:29.370> your<00:02:29.940> spray

00:02:30.170 --> 00:02:30.180 
same on these other two if your spray

00:02:30.180 --> 00:02:31.699 
same on these other two if your spray
hasn't<00:02:30.480> got<00:02:30.599> a<00:02:30.629> lot<00:02:30.780> of<00:02:30.840> nozzle<00:02:31.200> to<00:02:31.379> get<00:02:31.530> right

00:02:31.699 --> 00:02:31.709 
hasn't got a lot of nozzle to get right

00:02:31.709 --> 00:02:35.839 
hasn't got a lot of nozzle to get right
into<00:02:31.980> these<00:02:32.099> gaps<00:02:33.230> then<00:02:34.459> the<00:02:35.459> best<00:02:35.640> thing<00:02:35.730> to

00:02:35.839 --> 00:02:35.849 
into these gaps then the best thing to

00:02:35.849 --> 00:02:38.240 
into these gaps then the best thing to
do<00:02:36.090> is<00:02:36.239> just<00:02:37.110> get<00:02:37.260> something<00:02:37.560> like<00:02:37.709> a<00:02:37.739> cable

00:02:38.240 --> 00:02:38.250 
do is just get something like a cable

00:02:38.250 --> 00:02:42.800 
do is just get something like a cable
tie<00:02:38.640> and<00:02:38.940> just<00:02:39.930> rest<00:02:40.200> that<00:02:40.290> in<00:02:40.920> the<00:02:41.220> hole<00:02:41.810> and

00:02:42.800 --> 00:02:42.810 
tie and just rest that in the hole and

00:02:42.810 --> 00:02:45.500 
tie and just rest that in the hole and
then<00:02:43.170> put<00:02:43.200> the<00:02:43.470> spray<00:02:43.769> onto<00:02:44.040> here<00:02:44.280> and<00:02:45.269> then

00:02:45.500 --> 00:02:45.510 
then put the spray onto here and then

00:02:45.510 --> 00:02:48.680 
then put the spray onto here and then
that<00:02:45.660> will<00:02:45.810> run<00:02:45.989> down<00:02:46.519> and<00:02:47.519> drip<00:02:47.819> into<00:02:48.030> you<00:02:48.269> you

00:02:48.680 --> 00:02:48.690 
that will run down and drip into you you

00:02:48.690 --> 00:02:50.059 
that will run down and drip into you you
little<00:02:48.870> slot<00:02:49.170> down<00:02:49.379> here<00:02:49.620> rather<00:02:49.950> than

00:02:50.059 --> 00:02:50.069 
little slot down here rather than

00:02:50.069 --> 00:02:54.500 
little slot down here rather than
spraying<00:02:50.400> it<00:02:50.580> all<00:02:50.610> over<00:02:50.730> your<00:02:51.030> circuitry<00:02:53.510> once

00:02:54.500 --> 00:02:54.510 
spraying it all over your circuitry once

00:02:54.510 --> 00:02:56.059 
spraying it all over your circuitry once
you're<00:02:54.629> given<00:02:54.720> both<00:02:54.989> a<00:02:55.110> couple<00:02:55.379> of<00:02:55.470> sprays<00:02:55.709> and

00:02:56.059 --> 00:02:56.069 
you're given both a couple of sprays and

00:02:56.069 --> 00:02:59.630 
you're given both a couple of sprays and
you've<00:02:56.160> moved<00:02:56.280> the<00:02:56.400> sticks<00:02:56.700> around<00:02:57.920> then<00:02:58.920> they

00:02:59.630 --> 00:02:59.640 
you've moved the sticks around then they

00:02:59.640 --> 00:03:01.910 
you've moved the sticks around then they
should<00:02:59.849> be<00:02:59.970> clean<00:03:00.269> and<00:03:00.590> ready<00:03:01.590> to<00:03:01.620> fly<00:03:01.890> again

00:03:01.910 --> 00:03:01.920 
should be clean and ready to fly again

00:03:01.920 --> 00:03:05.660 
should be clean and ready to fly again
and<00:03:02.930> depend<00:03:03.930> on<00:03:03.959> how<00:03:04.140> often<00:03:04.620> you<00:03:04.800> fly<00:03:05.069> as<00:03:05.129> to

00:03:05.660 --> 00:03:05.670 
and depend on how often you fly as to

00:03:05.670 --> 00:03:07.940 
and depend on how often you fly as to
how<00:03:05.879> often<00:03:06.060> need<00:03:06.330> to<00:03:06.420> do<00:03:06.540> it<00:03:06.690> but<00:03:06.810> it's<00:03:06.959> it's

00:03:07.940 --> 00:03:07.950 
how often need to do it but it's it's

00:03:07.950 --> 00:03:11.119 
how often need to do it but it's it's
literally<00:03:08.280> a<00:03:08.459> five<00:03:08.849> minute<00:03:09.150> job<00:03:09.920> finally<00:03:10.920> show

00:03:11.119 --> 00:03:11.129 
literally a five minute job finally show

00:03:11.129 --> 00:03:11.570 
literally a five minute job finally show
you

00:03:11.570 --> 00:03:11.580 
you

00:03:11.580 --> 00:03:15.500 
you
I've<00:03:12.180> got<00:03:12.360> diagram<00:03:12.870> up<00:03:13.050> here<00:03:13.970> it's<00:03:14.970> a<00:03:15.060> swim<00:03:15.330> in

00:03:15.500 --> 00:03:15.510 
I've got diagram up here it's a swim in

00:03:15.510 --> 00:03:19.030 
I've got diagram up here it's a swim in
the<00:03:15.540> bed<00:03:16.640> like<00:03:17.640> that<00:03:17.670> is<00:03:17.970> a<00:03:18.000> basic

00:03:19.030 --> 00:03:19.040 
the bed like that is a basic

00:03:19.040 --> 00:03:22.550 
the bed like that is a basic
potentiometer<00:03:20.360> so<00:03:21.360> in<00:03:21.480> here<00:03:21.659> you've<00:03:21.810> got<00:03:21.989> the

00:03:22.550 --> 00:03:22.560 
potentiometer so in here you've got the

00:03:22.560 --> 00:03:24.320 
potentiometer so in here you've got the
resistance<00:03:23.040> element<00:03:23.459> that<00:03:23.940> goes<00:03:24.090> all<00:03:24.239> the<00:03:24.269> way

00:03:24.320 --> 00:03:24.330 
resistance element that goes all the way

00:03:24.330 --> 00:03:26.960 
resistance element that goes all the way
around<00:03:24.650> and<00:03:25.650> on<00:03:26.190> here<00:03:26.430> you<00:03:26.519> got<00:03:26.670> the<00:03:26.760> right

00:03:26.960 --> 00:03:26.970 
around and on here you got the right

00:03:26.970 --> 00:03:29.809 
around and on here you got the right
part<00:03:27.239> now<00:03:27.989> this<00:03:28.140> shaft<00:03:28.349> here<00:03:28.620> would<00:03:28.769> go<00:03:28.980> to

00:03:29.809 --> 00:03:29.819 
part now this shaft here would go to

00:03:29.819 --> 00:03:32.930 
part now this shaft here would go to
your<00:03:29.940> sticks<00:03:31.190> so<00:03:32.190> as<00:03:32.250> you<00:03:32.340> turn<00:03:32.519> your<00:03:32.580> sticks

00:03:32.930 --> 00:03:32.940 
your sticks so as you turn your sticks

00:03:32.940 --> 00:03:35.330 
your sticks so as you turn your sticks
the<00:03:33.150> WIPO<00:03:33.540> will<00:03:33.659> go<00:03:33.780> around<00:03:34.250> when<00:03:35.250> your

00:03:35.330 --> 00:03:35.340 
the WIPO will go around when your

00:03:35.340 --> 00:03:39.170 
the WIPO will go around when your
resistance<00:03:35.700> element<00:03:37.580> and<00:03:38.580> what<00:03:38.700> happens<00:03:39.000> is

00:03:39.170 --> 00:03:39.180 
resistance element and what happens is

00:03:39.180 --> 00:03:43.699 
resistance element and what happens is
after<00:03:39.330> time<00:03:39.690> on<00:03:40.489> cheaper<00:03:41.489> TX's<00:03:42.560> this<00:03:43.560> will

00:03:43.699 --> 00:03:43.709 
after time on cheaper TX's this will

00:03:43.709 --> 00:03:45.050 
after time on cheaper TX's this will
wear<00:03:43.890> away<00:03:43.920> and<00:03:44.340> you'll<00:03:44.430> get<00:03:44.549> like<00:03:44.700> a<00:03:44.730> fine

00:03:45.050 --> 00:03:45.060 
wear away and you'll get like a fine

00:03:45.060 --> 00:03:47.839 
wear away and you'll get like a fine
powdery<00:03:45.900> dust<00:03:46.110> you<00:03:46.950> get<00:03:47.129> deposits<00:03:47.610> around

00:03:47.839 --> 00:03:47.849 
powdery dust you get deposits around

00:03:47.849 --> 00:03:49.820 
powdery dust you get deposits around
here<00:03:48.090> and<00:03:48.360> then<00:03:49.260> obviously<00:03:49.349> going<00:03:49.650> to<00:03:49.709> get

00:03:49.820 --> 00:03:49.830 
here and then obviously going to get

00:03:49.830 --> 00:03:52.250 
here and then obviously going to get
poor<00:03:50.069> contact<00:03:50.629> which<00:03:51.629> is<00:03:51.750> why<00:03:51.900> you're<00:03:52.049> getting

00:03:52.250 --> 00:03:52.260 
poor contact which is why you're getting

00:03:52.260 --> 00:03:57.229 
poor contact which is why you're getting
the<00:03:52.349> glitches<00:03:52.590> or<00:03:53.209> more<00:03:54.209> expensive<00:03:55.189> TX's<00:03:56.239> this

00:03:57.229 --> 00:03:57.239 
the glitches or more expensive TX's this

00:03:57.239 --> 00:03:59.210 
the glitches or more expensive TX's this
is<00:03:57.360> made<00:03:57.540> of<00:03:57.720> more<00:03:57.870> expensive<00:03:58.290> materials<00:03:58.409> and

00:03:59.210 --> 00:03:59.220 
is made of more expensive materials and

00:03:59.220 --> 00:04:00.710 
is made of more expensive materials and
you<00:03:59.489> don't<00:03:59.640> get<00:03:59.790> that<00:03:59.909> dust<00:04:00.120> buildup<00:04:00.510> so<00:04:00.659> it

00:04:00.710 --> 00:04:00.720 
you don't get that dust buildup so it

00:04:00.720 --> 00:04:03.490 
you don't get that dust buildup so it
doesn't<00:04:00.930> need<00:04:00.989> to<00:04:01.140> be<00:04:01.170> done

00:04:03.490 --> 00:04:03.500 

00:04:03.500 --> 00:04:07.000 

one<00:04:04.370> more<00:04:04.610> thing<00:04:04.820> we<00:04:04.940> can<00:04:05.090> do<00:04:05.800> while<00:04:06.800> we<00:04:06.860> got

00:04:07.000 --> 00:04:07.010 
one more thing we can do while we got

00:04:07.010 --> 00:04:10.750 
one more thing we can do while we got
the<00:04:07.070> back<00:04:07.280> off<00:04:07.900> let<00:04:08.900> me<00:04:08.960> just<00:04:09.640> bring<00:04:10.640> the

00:04:10.750 --> 00:04:10.760 
the back off let me just bring the

00:04:10.760 --> 00:04:17.289 
the back off let me just bring the
camera<00:04:11.060> back<00:04:11.240> down<00:04:11.420> again<00:04:15.910> one<00:04:16.910> more<00:04:17.030> thing<00:04:17.209> we

00:04:17.289 --> 00:04:17.299 
camera back down again one more thing we

00:04:17.299 --> 00:04:22.600 
camera back down again one more thing we
can<00:04:17.510> do<00:04:17.690> is<00:04:19.480> the<00:04:20.480> ratchet<00:04:20.930> a<00:04:21.370> lot<00:04:22.370> of<00:04:22.430> people

00:04:22.600 --> 00:04:22.610 
can do is the ratchet a lot of people

00:04:22.610 --> 00:04:23.980 
can do is the ratchet a lot of people
don't<00:04:22.820> write<00:04:23.000> the<00:04:23.150> ratchet<00:04:23.510> because<00:04:23.780> when

00:04:23.980 --> 00:04:23.990 
don't write the ratchet because when

00:04:23.990 --> 00:04:26.020 
don't write the ratchet because when
you're<00:04:24.110> hovering<00:04:24.310> you'll<00:04:25.310> often<00:04:25.490> find<00:04:25.610> that

00:04:26.020 --> 00:04:26.030 
you're hovering you'll often find that

00:04:26.030 --> 00:04:29.020 
you're hovering you'll often find that
one<00:04:26.600> click<00:04:26.870> up<00:04:27.050> or<00:04:27.230> make<00:04:27.380> it<00:04:27.530> rise<00:04:27.790> one<00:04:28.790> click

00:04:29.020 --> 00:04:29.030 
one click up or make it rise one click

00:04:29.030 --> 00:04:30.730 
one click up or make it rise one click
down<00:04:29.240> will<00:04:29.420> make<00:04:29.450> it<00:04:29.690> drop<00:04:29.930> and<00:04:30.380> you<00:04:30.530> can't

00:04:30.730 --> 00:04:30.740 
down will make it drop and you can't

00:04:30.740 --> 00:04:34.750 
down will make it drop and you can't
just<00:04:30.920> get<00:04:31.040> that<00:04:31.130> dead<00:04:32.120> steady<00:04:32.420> hover<00:04:33.700> so<00:04:34.700> if

00:04:34.750 --> 00:04:34.760 
just get that dead steady hover so if

00:04:34.760 --> 00:04:35.890 
just get that dead steady hover so if
you<00:04:34.820> remove<00:04:35.060> the<00:04:35.240> ratchet<00:04:35.600> and<00:04:35.690> you've<00:04:35.780> got<00:04:35.870> a

00:04:35.890 --> 00:04:35.900 
you remove the ratchet and you've got a

00:04:35.900 --> 00:04:39.450 
you remove the ratchet and you've got a
smooth<00:04:36.170> action<00:04:37.750> it's<00:04:38.750> a<00:04:38.810> lot<00:04:38.990> more<00:04:39.170> accurate

00:04:39.450 --> 00:04:39.460 
smooth action it's a lot more accurate

00:04:39.460 --> 00:04:42.180 
smooth action it's a lot more accurate
you<00:04:40.460> can<00:04:40.520> get<00:04:40.700> it<00:04:40.820> exactly<00:04:41.300> where<00:04:41.510> you<00:04:41.540> want<00:04:41.600> it

00:04:42.180 --> 00:04:42.190 
you can get it exactly where you want it

00:04:42.190 --> 00:04:46.090 
you can get it exactly where you want it
now<00:04:43.190> the<00:04:43.250> ratchet<00:04:43.670> is<00:04:43.820> simply<00:04:44.210> this<00:04:44.900> arm<00:04:45.170> here

00:04:46.090 --> 00:04:46.100 
now the ratchet is simply this arm here

00:04:46.100 --> 00:04:50.260 
now the ratchet is simply this arm here
it's<00:04:47.030> on<00:04:47.150> this<00:04:47.270> little<00:04:47.570> ratchet<00:04:49.270> that's

00:04:50.260 --> 00:04:50.270 
it's on this little ratchet that's

00:04:50.270 --> 00:04:54.490 
it's on this little ratchet that's
connected<00:04:50.720> to<00:04:50.750> your<00:04:51.490> gimbal<00:04:52.490> here<00:04:53.380> there's<00:04:54.380> a

00:04:54.490 --> 00:04:54.500 
connected to your gimbal here there's a

00:04:54.500 --> 00:04:57.130 
connected to your gimbal here there's a
few<00:04:54.650> different<00:04:54.919> things<00:04:55.070> you<00:04:55.190> can<00:04:55.310> do<00:04:56.140> one

00:04:57.130 --> 00:04:57.140 
few different things you can do one

00:04:57.140 --> 00:05:02.620 
few different things you can do one
simple<00:04:57.380> thing<00:04:57.590> you<00:04:57.800> can<00:04:57.950> do<00:04:58.570> is<00:04:59.570> simply<00:05:01.630> move

00:05:02.620 --> 00:05:02.630 
simple thing you can do is simply move

00:05:02.630 --> 00:05:07.659 
simple thing you can do is simply move
it<00:05:02.919> now<00:05:03.919> the<00:05:03.980> way<00:05:06.130> that<00:05:07.130> for<00:05:07.310> some<00:05:07.460> people

00:05:07.659 --> 00:05:07.669 
it now the way that for some people

00:05:07.669 --> 00:05:11.650 
it now the way that for some people
though<00:05:07.940> is<00:05:08.630> to<00:05:08.960> loose<00:05:09.169> as<00:05:09.470> you<00:05:09.620> can<00:05:09.770> see<00:05:10.660> that's

00:05:11.650 --> 00:05:11.660 
though is to loose as you can see that's

00:05:11.660 --> 00:05:14.110 
though is to loose as you can see that's
quite<00:05:11.960> loose<00:05:12.169> of<00:05:12.320> people<00:05:12.880> don't<00:05:13.880> intend<00:05:14.090> to

00:05:14.110 --> 00:05:14.120 
quite loose of people don't intend to

00:05:14.120 --> 00:05:15.520 
quite loose of people don't intend to
undo<00:05:14.450> that<00:05:14.600> the<00:05:14.720> other<00:05:14.840> thing<00:05:14.990> you<00:05:15.080> can<00:05:15.230> do<00:05:15.350> is

00:05:15.520 --> 00:05:15.530 
undo that the other thing you can do is

00:05:15.530 --> 00:05:19.540 
undo that the other thing you can do is
file<00:05:16.490> away<00:05:16.790> these<00:05:17.710> notches<00:05:18.710> on<00:05:19.040> here<00:05:19.280> but<00:05:19.460> then

00:05:19.540 --> 00:05:19.550 
file away these notches on here but then

00:05:19.550 --> 00:05:20.710 
file away these notches on here but then
you're<00:05:19.669> going<00:05:19.760> to<00:05:19.850> get<00:05:19.970> dust<00:05:20.150> in<00:05:20.360> here<00:05:20.540> and

00:05:20.710 --> 00:05:20.720 
you're going to get dust in here and

00:05:20.720 --> 00:05:22.570 
you're going to get dust in here and
it's<00:05:20.840> fairly<00:05:21.560> permanent<00:05:21.830> if<00:05:22.160> you<00:05:22.250> don't<00:05:22.400> find

00:05:22.570 --> 00:05:22.580 
it's fairly permanent if you don't find

00:05:22.580 --> 00:05:25.860 
it's fairly permanent if you don't find
you<00:05:22.700> on<00:05:22.790> the<00:05:22.880> ratchet<00:05:23.030> on<00:05:23.270> later<00:05:23.510> on<00:05:23.780> then

00:05:25.860 --> 00:05:25.870 
you on the ratchet on later on then

00:05:25.870 --> 00:05:28.570 
you on the ratchet on later on then
there's<00:05:26.870> nothing<00:05:27.020> you<00:05:27.169> can<00:05:27.350> do<00:05:27.580> you're

00:05:28.570 --> 00:05:28.580 
there's nothing you can do you're

00:05:28.580 --> 00:05:33.870 
there's nothing you can do you're
stumped<00:05:29.110> the<00:05:30.110> other<00:05:30.229> thing<00:05:30.410> that<00:05:30.610> what<00:05:31.610> I<00:05:31.640> did

00:05:33.870 --> 00:05:33.880 
stumped the other thing that what I did

00:05:33.880 --> 00:05:39.500 
stumped the other thing that what I did
was<00:05:34.880> to<00:05:35.030> undo<00:05:35.360> it

00:05:39.500 --> 00:05:39.510 

00:05:39.510 --> 00:05:46.340 

but<00:05:40.050> fiddly<00:05:43.580> why<00:05:44.580> there<00:05:44.790> was<00:05:44.910> to<00:05:45.060> undo<00:05:45.360> it<00:05:45.390> and

00:05:46.340 --> 00:05:46.350 
but fiddly why there was to undo it and

00:05:46.350 --> 00:05:53.360 
but fiddly why there was to undo it and
turn<00:05:46.950> it<00:05:47.100> round<00:05:48.200> and<00:05:49.520> just<00:05:50.520> put<00:05:50.820> a<00:05:51.980> slight<00:05:52.980> bend

00:05:53.360 --> 00:05:53.370 
turn it round and just put a slight bend

00:05:53.370 --> 00:06:03.700 
turn it round and just put a slight bend
in<00:05:55.130> the<00:05:56.130> arm<00:05:57.080> turn<00:05:58.080> it<00:05:58.260> over<00:05:58.410> and<00:05:59.600> then<00:06:00.600> you<00:06:00.630> can

00:06:03.700 --> 00:06:03.710 

00:06:03.710 --> 00:06:19.760 

glue<00:06:04.710> that<00:06:04.860> back<00:06:05.070> on<00:06:12.740> over<00:06:13.740> the<00:06:13.860> arm<00:06:18.770> screw

00:06:19.760 --> 00:06:19.770 
glue that back on over the arm screw

00:06:19.770 --> 00:06:24.440 
glue that back on over the arm screw
that<00:06:19.950> in<00:06:20.840> and<00:06:21.840> that<00:06:21.900> to<00:06:22.200> me<00:06:22.380> is<00:06:22.850> a<00:06:23.850> nice<00:06:24.120> feel

00:06:24.440 --> 00:06:24.450 
that in and that to me is a nice feel

00:06:24.450 --> 00:06:27.560 
that in and that to me is a nice feel
it's<00:06:24.630> not<00:06:24.720> too<00:06:24.930> loose<00:06:25.940> it's<00:06:26.940> not<00:06:27.030> that<00:06:27.300> tight

00:06:27.560 --> 00:06:27.570 
it's not too loose it's not that tight

00:06:27.570 --> 00:06:30.530 
it's not too loose it's not that tight
either<00:06:27.830> or<00:06:28.830> if<00:06:29.700> you<00:06:29.820> wanted<00:06:30.060> to<00:06:30.180> you<00:06:30.300> could<00:06:30.390> get

00:06:30.530 --> 00:06:30.540 
either or if you wanted to you could get

00:06:30.540 --> 00:06:32.510 
either or if you wanted to you could get
some<00:06:30.720> silicone<00:06:30.930> fuel<00:06:31.440> tube<00:06:31.650> in<00:06:31.920> from<00:06:32.160> a<00:06:32.190> model

00:06:32.510 --> 00:06:32.520 
some silicone fuel tube in from a model

00:06:32.520 --> 00:06:34.790 
some silicone fuel tube in from a model
shop<00:06:32.730> and<00:06:32.970> slice<00:06:33.870> some<00:06:34.140> of<00:06:34.200> that<00:06:34.260> over<00:06:34.440> the<00:06:34.620> arm

00:06:34.790 --> 00:06:34.800 
shop and slice some of that over the arm

00:06:34.800 --> 00:06:36.620 
shop and slice some of that over the arm
so<00:06:35.130> it's<00:06:35.250> you've<00:06:35.640> got<00:06:35.760> a<00:06:35.790> bit<00:06:36.000> more<00:06:36.150> resistance

00:06:36.620 --> 00:06:36.630 
so it's you've got a bit more resistance

00:06:36.630 --> 00:06:40.370 
so it's you've got a bit more resistance
there<00:06:36.900> if<00:06:37.500> that's<00:06:37.710> too<00:06:37.980> loose<00:06:38.220> for<00:06:38.250> you<00:06:39.380> and

00:06:40.370 --> 00:06:40.380 
there if that's too loose for you and

00:06:40.380 --> 00:06:43.400 
there if that's too loose for you and
once<00:06:40.590> that's<00:06:40.740> all<00:06:40.890> done<00:06:41.930> it's<00:06:42.930> just<00:06:43.170> doing<00:06:43.290> the

00:06:43.400 --> 00:06:43.410 
once that's all done it's just doing the

00:06:43.410 --> 00:06:45.950 
once that's all done it's just doing the
opposite<00:06:43.830> then<00:06:44.210> which<00:06:45.210> is<00:06:45.240> plug<00:06:45.660> your<00:06:45.780> lead

00:06:45.950 --> 00:06:45.960 
opposite then which is plug your lead

00:06:45.960 --> 00:06:48.830 
opposite then which is plug your lead
back<00:06:46.200> in<00:06:46.760> do<00:06:47.760> your<00:06:47.880> board<00:06:48.090> you<00:06:48.360> better<00:06:48.540> leave

00:06:48.830 --> 00:06:48.840 
back in do your board you better leave

00:06:48.840 --> 00:06:51.110 
back in do your board you better leave
which<00:06:49.050> can<00:06:49.260> only<00:06:49.380> go<00:06:49.530> one<00:06:49.680> way<00:06:50.030> you've<00:06:51.030> got

00:06:51.110 --> 00:06:51.120 
which can only go one way you've got

00:06:51.120 --> 00:06:54.320 
which can only go one way you've got
little<00:06:51.270> lugs<00:06:51.510> on<00:06:51.660> here<00:06:51.960> and<00:06:52.290> it<00:06:53.160> will<00:06:53.250> slots<00:06:53.550> on

00:06:54.320 --> 00:06:54.330 
little lugs on here and it will slots on

00:06:54.330 --> 00:07:04.700 
little lugs on here and it will slots on
here<00:06:56.930> you<00:06:57.930> can<00:06:58.080> slide<00:06:58.350> that<00:06:58.560> back<00:06:58.860> in<00:07:03.560> put<00:07:04.560> your

00:07:04.700 --> 00:07:04.710 
here you can slide that back in put your

00:07:04.710 --> 00:07:13.690 
here you can slide that back in put your
switch<00:07:06.650> in<00:07:07.650> here<00:07:10.190> back<00:07:11.190> through<00:07:11.430> the<00:07:11.520> hole

00:07:13.690 --> 00:07:13.700 
switch in here back through the hole

00:07:13.700 --> 00:07:19.430 
switch in here back through the hole
pick<00:07:14.700> your<00:07:14.880> top<00:07:15.060> ring<00:07:15.330> back<00:07:15.570> on<00:07:15.780> a<00:07:18.350> little<00:07:19.350> bit

00:07:19.430 --> 00:07:19.440 
pick your top ring back on a little bit

00:07:19.440 --> 00:07:22.670 
pick your top ring back on a little bit
fiddly

00:07:22.670 --> 00:07:22.680 

00:07:22.680 --> 00:07:28.990 

one<00:07:23.370> thing<00:07:23.640> you've<00:07:23.820> got<00:07:24.180> to<00:07:24.330> be<00:07:24.450> sure<00:07:24.660> of<00:07:24.690> is

00:07:28.990 --> 00:07:29.000 

00:07:29.000 --> 00:07:32.150 

when<00:07:30.000> that's<00:07:30.090> on<00:07:30.620> when<00:07:31.620> you<00:07:31.710> put<00:07:31.920> your<00:07:32.010> case

00:07:32.150 --> 00:07:32.160 
when that's on when you put your case

00:07:32.160 --> 00:07:35.530 
when that's on when you put your case
back<00:07:32.430> together<00:07:32.580> again

00:07:35.530 --> 00:07:35.540 

00:07:35.540 --> 00:07:37.730 

have<00:07:36.540> a<00:07:36.630> good<00:07:36.780> look<00:07:36.960> as<00:07:37.260> it<00:07:37.410> goes<00:07:37.560> back

00:07:37.730 --> 00:07:37.740 
have a good look as it goes back

00:07:37.740 --> 00:07:40.430 
have a good look as it goes back
together<00:07:37.890> to<00:07:38.310> make<00:07:38.460> sure<00:07:38.490> these<00:07:38.820> leads<00:07:39.260> as<00:07:40.260> you

00:07:40.430 --> 00:07:40.440 
together to make sure these leads as you

00:07:40.440 --> 00:07:43.880 
together to make sure these leads as you
can<00:07:40.560> see<00:07:40.680> this<00:07:40.740> one<00:07:40.920> here<00:07:42.470> doesn't<00:07:43.470> fare<00:07:43.710> when

00:07:43.880 --> 00:07:43.890 
can see this one here doesn't fare when

00:07:43.890 --> 00:07:46.870 
can see this one here doesn't fare when
you<00:07:44.010> this<00:07:44.160> is<00:07:44.370> obviously<00:07:44.870> going<00:07:45.870> to<00:07:45.960> lose<00:07:46.110> you

00:07:46.870 --> 00:07:46.880 
you this is obviously going to lose you
