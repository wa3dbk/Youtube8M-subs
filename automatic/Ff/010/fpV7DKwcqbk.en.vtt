00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.000
 Translator: Mohammad Houri Checker: Ghalia Turki 

00:00:14.205 --> 00:00:15.880
 Some superheroes can grow up 

00:00:15.880 --> 00:00:19.604
 For the size of a building if they wanted. 

00:00:19.604 --> 00:00:21.109
 This is too scary! 

00:00:21.109 --> 00:00:22.715
 But scientists must ask 

00:00:22.715 --> 00:00:26.298
 Where additional materials come from. 

00:00:26.298 --> 00:00:28.394
 The Law of Mass Protection states that 

00:00:28.394 --> 00:00:31.108
 The mass does not create 

00:00:31.108 --> 00:00:32.272
 And do not destroy, 

00:00:32.272 --> 00:00:33.942
 This means that our hero's block 

00:00:33.942 --> 00:00:37.882
 Will not change just because its size has changed. 

00:00:37.882 --> 00:00:42.236
 For example, when we baked a soft sponge cake, 

00:00:42.236 --> 00:00:44.064
 Although the product is tasteful 

00:00:44.064 --> 00:00:46.691
 It is much larger than the size of the cake mixture 

00:00:46.691 --> 00:00:48.206
 Which reached the oven, 

00:00:48.206 --> 00:00:50.826
 The weight of the cake mixture is still equal 

00:00:50.826 --> 00:00:52.001
 To weight the cake 

00:00:52.001 --> 00:00:55.695
 In addition to moisture evaporated. 

00:00:55.695 --> 00:00:56.978
 In the chemical equation, 

00:00:56.978 --> 00:00:59.589
 Molecules rearranged the arrangement for new components, 

00:00:59.589 --> 00:01:03.282
 However, all components must be considered. 

00:01:03.282 --> 00:01:05.173
 When our hero expands 

00:01:05.173 --> 00:01:07.046
 Of the length of 6 feet 

00:01:07.046 --> 00:01:09.428
 To 18 feet long, 

00:01:09.428 --> 00:01:11.765
 Its length is 3 times, 

00:01:11.765 --> 00:01:13.693
 Galileo's law says the area of ​​the cube 

00:01:13.693 --> 00:01:15.852
 It will weigh 27 

00:01:15.852 --> 00:01:18.311
 - 3 hit 3 hit 3 equals 27 - 

00:01:18.311 --> 00:01:19.523
 Normal weight hit 

00:01:19.523 --> 00:01:23.021
 Since it has doubled in the three dimensions. 

00:01:23.021 --> 00:01:26.566
 So, when our hero turned into a giant, 

00:01:26.566 --> 00:01:29.238
 We are dealing with two possibilities. 

00:01:29.238 --> 00:01:31.657
 The length of our hero is 18 feet 

00:01:31.657 --> 00:01:34.545
 His weight remained 200 pounds, 

00:01:34.545 --> 00:01:36.994
 The original weight in this human model. 

00:01:36.994 --> 00:01:42.126
 Now, the second option, the weight of our champion is 5400 pounds 

00:01:42.126 --> 00:01:46.578
 _ 200 pound hit 27 equals 5400 pounds _ 

00:01:46.578 --> 00:01:48.204
 When it is 18 feet long, 

00:01:48.204 --> 00:01:52.539
 Which means that it weighs 5400 pounds 

00:01:52.539 --> 00:01:54.732
 When its length is 6 feet. 

00:01:57.455 --> 00:01:59.064
 No one can ride the same elevator with him 

00:01:59.064 --> 00:02:00.847
 Without warning exit. 

00:02:00.847 --> 00:02:02.731
 Now, the second option seems a bit more 

00:02:02.731 --> 00:02:03.986
 Scientifically reasonable, 

00:02:03.986 --> 00:02:05.933
 But he raises a question, 

00:02:05.933 --> 00:02:07.653
 How to walk in the garden 

00:02:07.653 --> 00:02:08.898
 Without drowning in the ground 

00:02:08.898 --> 00:02:11.132
 Since the pressure exerted on the soil 

00:02:11.132 --> 00:02:12.574
 Its mass is calculated 

00:02:12.574 --> 00:02:15.819
 Divided by an area below his feet? 

00:02:15.819 --> 00:02:18.407
 And what kind of socks and superhero shoes 

00:02:18.407 --> 00:02:21.488
 Which he wears in his feet to bear all this friction 

00:02:21.488 --> 00:02:25.122
 Resulting from the withdrawal of his body, which weighs 5400 pounds 

00:02:25.122 --> 00:02:28.649
 When running on the road? 

00:02:28.649 --> 00:02:30.327
 Can he even run? 

00:02:30.327 --> 00:02:32.673
 I will not even wonder how to find panties 

00:02:32.673 --> 00:02:35.716
 Flexible enough to withstand stretch. 

00:02:41.180 --> 00:02:43.350
 Now, to discover density 

00:02:43.350 --> 00:02:45.856
 Of the two options mentioned above. 

00:02:45.856 --> 00:02:48.907
 Density is defined as a mass divided by volume. 

00:02:48.907 --> 00:02:51.769
 The human body consists of bones and flesh, 

00:02:51.769 --> 00:02:54.411
 Which contain relatively dense. 

00:02:54.411 --> 00:02:57.658
 In the first option, if the hero weighed 200 pounds all the time, 

00:02:57.658 --> 00:03:00.856
 Then bone and flesh will be in normal size. 

00:03:00.856 --> 00:03:03.011
 When it grows to a larger size 

00:03:03.011 --> 00:03:04.668
 While still weighing 200 pounds, 

00:03:04.668 --> 00:03:06.507
 He has effectively transformed himself 

00:03:06.507 --> 00:03:10.003
 To a giant bear. 

00:03:13.188 --> 00:03:15.219
 In the second option, if the weight of the hero 

00:03:15.219 --> 00:03:17.142
 5400 pounds length of time, 

00:03:17.142 --> 00:03:20.231
 Then the flesh and bones shall be in 18 feet 

00:03:20.231 --> 00:03:24.068
 With 5400 pounds supported by the legs. 

00:03:24.068 --> 00:03:25.565
 The weight will be on the bones of the legs 

00:03:25.565 --> 00:03:27.855
 At different angles whenever you move. 

00:03:27.855 --> 00:03:30.183
 Bones, not flexible, hard to bear, 

00:03:30.183 --> 00:03:31.806
 This means they do not bend, 

00:03:31.806 --> 00:03:33.898
 So it's easy to break it. 

00:03:33.898 --> 00:03:36.235
 Muscle tendons will also be prone to rupture. 

00:03:36.235 --> 00:03:38.172
 High-rise buildings remain standing 

00:03:38.172 --> 00:03:39.986
 Because it possesses steel structures 

00:03:39.986 --> 00:03:42.866
 Do not run or jump around the forest. 

00:03:42.866 --> 00:03:44.034
 On the other hand, our hero, 

00:03:44.034 --> 00:03:46.838
 Fell badly 

00:03:46.838 --> 00:03:48.631
 He fell to the ground. 

00:03:51.999 --> 00:03:55.214
 Considering the physical status of all mammals, 

00:03:55.214 --> 00:03:57.424
 His heart needs to pump large amounts of blood 

00:03:57.424 --> 00:03:59.913
 Throughout his body to provide adequate oxygen 

00:03:59.913 --> 00:04:03.124
 Its a 5400 pound move around it of body weight. 

00:04:03.124 --> 00:04:05.257
 This would take enormous energy, 

00:04:05.257 --> 00:04:06.493
 Which he needs to secure 

00:04:06.493 --> 00:04:11.288
 27 Hit 3000 calories of food every day 

00:04:11.288 --> 00:04:14.937
 Now, this is about 150 large meals from the McDonalds. 

00:04:14.937 --> 00:04:17.297
 27 hit 3,000 calorie equals 

00:04:17.297 --> 00:04:20.818
 81000 divided by 550 calories 

00:04:20.818 --> 00:04:22.280
 Equals 147. 

00:04:22.280 --> 00:04:24.146
 He has no time to fight crime 

00:04:24.146 --> 00:04:26.424
 He has to eat all the time 

00:04:26.424 --> 00:04:28.453
 And work from 9 to 5 

00:04:28.453 --> 00:04:31.956
 To provide all the food he eats. 

00:04:31.956 --> 00:04:32.919
 And what about superheroes 

00:04:32.919 --> 00:04:35.927
 Who turn their bodies into rocks or sand? 

00:04:35.927 --> 00:04:38.595
 Well, everything on earth consists of atoms, 

00:04:38.595 --> 00:04:39.769
 And what each element knows 

00:04:39.769 --> 00:04:42.098
 Is the number of protons in the nucleus, 

00:04:42.098 --> 00:04:45.474
 This is how our periodic schedule is organized. 

00:04:45.474 --> 00:04:47.312
 Hydrogen has a proton, 

00:04:47.312 --> 00:04:48.897
 Helium, Protonan, 

00:04:48.897 --> 00:04:50.087
 Lithium, 3 protons, 

00:04:50.087 --> 00:04:51.314
 And so drag. 

00:04:51.314 --> 00:04:53.407
 The main component is the most common form 

00:04:53.407 --> 00:04:55.403
 Sand is a silicon oxide. 

00:04:55.403 --> 00:04:57.656
 At the same time, the human body is made up of 

00:04:57.656 --> 00:04:59.408
 65% Oxygen, 

00:04:59.408 --> 00:05:00.960
 18% carbon, 

00:05:00.960 --> 00:05:02.115
 10% Hydrogen, 

00:05:02.115 --> 00:05:04.580
 And 7% other components 

00:05:04.580 --> 00:05:08.830
 Of which 0.002% are silicon. 

00:05:08.830 --> 00:05:10.055
 In chemical reactions, 

00:05:10.055 --> 00:05:12.837
 The elements react to be new compounds. 

00:05:12.837 --> 00:05:14.798
 So, where did all this silicon get from 

00:05:14.798 --> 00:05:17.541
 Is it necessary to make sand? 

00:05:17.541 --> 00:05:19.094
 Of course, we can change the elements 

00:05:19.094 --> 00:05:21.898
 Through nuclear fusion or interaction. 

00:05:21.898 --> 00:05:25.049
 In any case, nuclear entanglement requires a lot of heat, 

00:05:25.049 --> 00:05:28.835
 The natural occurrence of these reactions is only in the stars. 

00:05:28.835 --> 00:05:31.564
 In order to benefit from fusion in a short period of time, 

00:05:31.564 --> 00:05:32.989
 Temperature in the area 

00:05:32.989 --> 00:05:35.485
 You must be more free from the sun. 

00:05:35.485 --> 00:05:39.749
 All innocent bystanders will be burned and turned into ashes. 

00:05:41.302 --> 00:05:44.067
 Nuclear fission is fast but not the best 

00:05:44.067 --> 00:05:47.308
 Because it often produces a lot of radioactive particles. 

00:05:47.308 --> 00:05:48.506
 He will become our hero 

00:05:48.506 --> 00:05:51.545
 He walks and speaks as a nuclear power plant, 

00:05:51.545 --> 00:05:55.171
 Eventually he will hurt every person who tries to save him. 

00:05:55.171 --> 00:05:57.758
 Do you really need to heat the sun 

00:05:57.758 --> 00:06:02.023
 Or a radioactive nuclear plant inside your body? 

00:06:06.899 --> 00:06:09.394
 Now, what a great physics lesson 

00:06:09.394 --> 00:06:11.863
 Will you discover it later? 

00:06:11.863 --> 00:06:15.940
 Turning volume and body content, 

00:06:15.940 --> 00:06:17.277
 High speed, 

00:06:17.277 --> 00:06:19.136
 Flight, 

00:06:19.136 --> 00:06:22.101
 Super powers, 

00:06:22.101 --> 00:06:24.426
 Eternity, 

00:06:24.426 --> 00:06:26.300
 And 

00:06:26.304 --> 00:06:29.274
 Disappearance.
