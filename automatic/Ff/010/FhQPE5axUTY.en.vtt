it<00:02:36.890> is<00:02:37.250> better<00:02:37.519> to<00:02:37.670> go<00:02:38.180> to<00:02:38.209> a<00:02:38.510> launch<00:02:38.870> pad<00:02:39.110> than

00:02:39.430 --> 00:02:39.440 
it is better to go to a launch pad than

00:02:39.440 --> 00:02:42.130 
it is better to go to a launch pad than
to<00:02:39.680> build<00:02:40.370> a<00:02:40.519> new<00:02:40.700> one<00:02:40.910> if<00:02:41.120> you<00:02:41.269> can<00:02:41.510> is<00:02:41.780> because

00:02:42.130 --> 00:02:42.140 
to build a new one if you can is because

00:02:42.140 --> 00:02:44.860 
to build a new one if you can is because
you<00:02:42.320> do<00:02:42.470> have<00:02:42.500> a<00:02:42.680> building<00:02:43.220> limit<00:02:43.730> and<00:02:44.120> your

00:02:44.860 --> 00:02:44.870 
you do have a building limit and your

00:02:44.870 --> 00:02:48.280 
you do have a building limit and your
team<00:02:45.110> is<00:02:45.260> only<00:02:45.410> allowed<00:02:45.769> to<00:02:45.910> build<00:02:47.290> 32

00:02:48.280 --> 00:02:48.290 
team is only allowed to build 32

00:02:48.290 --> 00:02:51.330 
team is only allowed to build 32
structures<00:02:49.040> on<00:02:49.580> the<00:02:50.060> map<00:02:50.209> at<00:02:50.420> any<00:02:50.570> given<00:02:50.810> time

00:02:51.330 --> 00:02:51.340 
structures on the map at any given time

00:02:51.340 --> 00:02:59.080 
structures on the map at any given time
so<00:02:52.340> if<00:02:53.120> you<00:02:53.769> build<00:02:54.769> imprudently<00:02:55.900> then<00:02:57.820> it<00:02:58.820> can

00:02:59.080 --> 00:02:59.090 
so if you build imprudently then it can

00:02:59.090 --> 00:03:01.090 
so if you build imprudently then it can
definitely<00:02:59.720> catch<00:03:00.380> up<00:03:00.560> with<00:03:00.680> you<00:03:00.830> and<00:03:00.950> then

00:03:01.090 --> 00:03:01.100 
definitely catch up with you and then

00:03:01.100 --> 00:03:02.500 
definitely catch up with you and then
all<00:03:01.220> the<00:03:01.280> sudden<00:03:01.400> you<00:03:01.610> found<00:03:01.790> yourself<00:03:02.209> not

00:03:02.500 --> 00:03:02.510 
all the sudden you found yourself not

00:03:02.510 --> 00:03:05.560 
all the sudden you found yourself not
being<00:03:02.810> able<00:03:02.900> to<00:03:03.880> build<00:03:04.880> the<00:03:05.030> things<00:03:05.239> you<00:03:05.390> need

00:03:05.560 --> 00:03:05.570 
being able to build the things you need

00:03:05.570 --> 00:03:12.730 
being able to build the things you need
to<00:03:05.690> build<00:03:05.810> to<00:03:06.200> not<00:03:06.620> die

00:03:12.730 --> 00:03:12.740 

00:03:12.740 --> 00:03:16.570 

I<00:03:13.570> have<00:03:14.570> a<00:03:14.600> jetpack<00:03:14.960> on<00:03:15.200> but<00:03:15.770> I<00:03:15.950> really<00:03:16.340> want<00:03:16.520> to

00:03:16.570 --> 00:03:16.580 
I have a jetpack on but I really want to

00:03:16.580 --> 00:03:19.810 
I have a jetpack on but I really want to
get<00:03:16.700> to<00:03:17.050> that<00:03:18.050> center<00:03:19.040> area<00:03:19.070> so<00:03:19.490> let's<00:03:19.640> see<00:03:19.790> I

00:03:19.810 --> 00:03:19.820 
get to that center area so let's see I

00:03:19.820 --> 00:03:25.570 
get to that center area so let's see I
think<00:03:20.180> I<00:03:20.240> can<00:03:20.390> jet<00:03:20.600> back<00:03:20.780> there<00:03:21.020> oh<00:03:23.950> wait<00:03:24.950> it's

00:03:25.570 --> 00:03:25.580 
think I can jet back there oh wait it's

00:03:25.580 --> 00:03:30.160 
think I can jet back there oh wait it's
way<00:03:25.700> up<00:03:25.820> there<00:03:28.480> we're<00:03:29.480> gonna<00:03:29.600> put<00:03:29.780> the<00:03:29.870> vulture

00:03:30.160 --> 00:03:30.170 
way up there we're gonna put the vulture

00:03:30.170 --> 00:03:32.050 
way up there we're gonna put the vulture
jetpack<00:03:30.530> to<00:03:30.710> the<00:03:30.800> test<00:03:31.040> and<00:03:31.520> see<00:03:31.610> if<00:03:31.760> I<00:03:31.910> can

00:03:32.050 --> 00:03:32.060 
jetpack to the test and see if I can

00:03:32.060 --> 00:03:33.520 
jetpack to the test and see if I can
climb<00:03:32.270> all<00:03:32.480> the<00:03:32.690> way<00:03:32.810> up<00:03:32.870> to<00:03:33.050> that<00:03:33.170> point<00:03:33.350> up

00:03:33.520 --> 00:03:33.530 
climb all the way up to that point up

00:03:33.530 --> 00:03:36.310 
climb all the way up to that point up
there<00:03:34.000> not<00:03:35.000> that<00:03:35.060> we're<00:03:35.840> gonna<00:03:35.930> have<00:03:36.080> a<00:03:36.140> lot<00:03:36.290> of

00:03:36.310 --> 00:03:36.320 
there not that we're gonna have a lot of

00:03:36.320 --> 00:03:41.770 
there not that we're gonna have a lot of
time<00:03:36.530> to<00:03:36.680> do<00:03:36.800> that<00:03:40.090> the<00:03:41.090> jetpack<00:03:41.300> just<00:03:41.630> has<00:03:41.750> a

00:03:41.770 --> 00:03:41.780 
time to do that the jetpack just has a

00:03:41.780 --> 00:03:43.600 
time to do that the jetpack just has a
recharging<00:03:42.350> fuel<00:03:42.590> bar<00:03:42.770> that<00:03:42.980> you<00:03:43.040> can<00:03:43.190> see<00:03:43.370> at

00:03:43.600 --> 00:03:43.610 
recharging fuel bar that you can see at

00:03:43.610 --> 00:03:46.810 
recharging fuel bar that you can see at
the<00:03:43.730> bottom<00:03:43.880> there<00:03:45.010> Peter<00:03:46.100> flying<00:03:46.520> a<00:03:46.640> hawk

00:03:46.810 --> 00:03:46.820 
the bottom there Peter flying a hawk

00:03:46.820 --> 00:03:48.220 
the bottom there Peter flying a hawk
how's<00:03:47.150> that<00:03:47.270> going<00:03:47.480> for<00:03:47.540> you<00:03:47.780> looks<00:03:48.080> like

00:03:48.220 --> 00:03:48.230 
how's that going for you looks like

00:03:48.230 --> 00:03:50.920 
how's that going for you looks like
sighs<00:03:48.440> it's<00:03:48.710> the<00:03:49.340> screen<00:03:49.610> is<00:03:49.760> pretty<00:03:49.940> hard<00:03:50.840> to

00:03:50.920 --> 00:03:50.930 
sighs it's the screen is pretty hard to

00:03:50.930 --> 00:03:54.520 
sighs it's the screen is pretty hard to
see<00:03:51.160> yeah<00:03:52.160> yeah<00:03:52.700> I<00:03:53.090> think<00:03:53.630> we<00:03:53.960> will

00:03:54.520 --> 00:03:54.530 
see yeah yeah I think we will

00:03:54.530 --> 00:03:56.380 
see yeah yeah I think we will
maybe<00:03:54.800> abandon<00:03:55.550> the<00:03:55.670> split<00:03:55.910> screen<00:03:56.000> that

00:03:56.380 --> 00:03:56.390 
maybe abandon the split screen that

00:03:56.390 --> 00:04:04.620 
maybe abandon the split screen that
fills<00:03:56.630> match<00:03:58.810> yeah<00:03:59.840> capture<00:04:00.500> point<00:04:03.400> so<00:04:04.400> that

00:04:04.620 --> 00:04:04.630 
fills match yeah capture point so that

00:04:04.630 --> 00:04:07.150 
fills match yeah capture point so that
your<00:04:05.630> recourse<00:04:06.050> against<00:04:06.380> enemy<00:04:06.650> hawks<00:04:06.860> when

00:04:07.150 --> 00:04:07.160 
your recourse against enemy hawks when

00:04:07.160 --> 00:04:09.790 
your recourse against enemy hawks when
you're<00:04:07.340> on<00:04:07.520> the<00:04:07.670> ground<00:04:07.940> is<00:04:08.500> well<00:04:09.500> they<00:04:09.620> could

00:04:09.790 --> 00:04:09.800 
you're on the ground is well they could

00:04:09.800 --> 00:04:11.350 
you're on the ground is well they could
just<00:04:09.950> be<00:04:10.070> standing<00:04:10.280> there<00:04:10.670> and<00:04:10.850> then<00:04:11.090> you<00:04:11.210> can

00:04:11.350 --> 00:04:11.360 
just be standing there and then you can

00:04:11.360 --> 00:04:14.350 
just be standing there and then you can
take<00:04:11.480> potshots<00:04:11.750> at<00:04:12.110> them<00:04:12.790> also<00:04:13.790> the<00:04:13.910> rocket

00:04:14.350 --> 00:04:14.360 
take potshots at them also the rocket

00:04:14.360 --> 00:04:20.620 
take potshots at them also the rocket
launcher<00:04:14.750> has<00:04:14.990> a<00:04:15.050> lock-on<00:04:15.890> ability<00:04:16.600> so<00:04:19.510> in<00:04:20.510> the

00:04:20.620 --> 00:04:20.630 
launcher has a lock-on ability so in the

00:04:20.630 --> 00:04:30.940 
launcher has a lock-on ability so in the
sky<00:04:20.870> oh<00:04:22.690> friendly<00:04:28.450> what<00:04:29.650> were<00:04:30.650> you<00:04:30.770> on<00:04:30.920> a

00:04:30.940 --> 00:04:30.950 
sky oh friendly what were you on a

00:04:30.950 --> 00:04:33.640 
sky oh friendly what were you on a
different<00:04:31.310> team<00:04:31.690> looks<00:04:32.690> like<00:04:32.810> it<00:04:32.960> maybe

00:04:33.640 --> 00:04:33.650 
different team looks like it maybe

00:04:33.650 --> 00:04:34.840 
different team looks like it maybe
that's<00:04:33.830> why<00:04:34.040> we<00:04:34.160> couldn't<00:04:34.400> find<00:04:34.520> each<00:04:34.670> other

00:04:34.840 --> 00:04:34.850 
that's why we couldn't find each other

00:04:34.850 --> 00:04:42.220 
that's why we couldn't find each other
perhaps<00:04:35.500> nice<00:04:37.870> all<00:04:38.870> right<00:04:38.930> no<00:04:39.800> more<00:04:39.980> splits<00:04:41.230> so

00:04:42.220 --> 00:04:42.230 
perhaps nice all right no more splits so

00:04:42.230 --> 00:04:43.840 
perhaps nice all right no more splits so
I<00:04:42.260> think<00:04:42.380> you<00:04:42.650> have<00:04:42.920> to<00:04:43.040> just<00:04:43.100> drop<00:04:43.460> out<00:04:43.670> on

00:04:43.840 --> 00:04:43.850 
I think you have to just drop out on

00:04:43.850 --> 00:04:48.520 
I think you have to just drop out on
screen<00:04:45.130> that<00:04:46.130> was<00:04:46.280> zones<00:04:46.700> now<00:04:47.420> I'm<00:04:47.720> gonna<00:04:47.840> go

00:04:48.520 --> 00:04:48.530 
screen that was zones now I'm gonna go

00:04:48.530 --> 00:04:53.980 
screen that was zones now I'm gonna go
do<00:04:49.780> let's<00:04:50.780> play<00:04:50.960> some<00:04:51.230> capture<00:04:51.650> the<00:04:51.740> flag
