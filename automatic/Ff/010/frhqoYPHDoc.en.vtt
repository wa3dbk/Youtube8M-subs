00:00:16.350 --> 00:00:25.400
 I will tell you 

00:00:18.770 --> 00:00:28.960
 At first it is a ema this car first imp s wrx r sti version 3 

00:00:25.400 --> 00:00:32.320
 It is a car about 15 years ago 

00:00:28.960 --> 00:00:38.120
 Oh but in is over to how Well engine 

00:00:32.320 --> 00:00:40.410
 It's about turning this key . Well, this is the same as that automa and Cherry tree children . 

00:00:38.120 --> 00:00:42.890
 Though I think I wonder what 

00:00:40.410 --> 00:00:42.890
 First of all 

00:00:43.940 --> 00:00:52.960
 The shift lever is a shift lever 

00:00:47.210 --> 00:00:54.320
 Make sure that the move to or greater than the action has entered the Nutro 

00:00:52.960 --> 00:00:58.100
 Example that 

00:00:54.320 --> 00:01:01.300
 Though it is one pair which is in one color now 

00:00:58.100 --> 00:01:04.659
 Even if you are in one pair 

00:01:01.300 --> 00:01:07.970
 Gears move, whichever company you are in 

00:01:04.659 --> 00:01:10.740
 Is 3 speed but 4 colors 

00:01:07.970 --> 00:01:16.530
 However, the point is received 

00:01:10.740 --> 00:01:20.670
 Well this is neutral kana location also actually move much larger expect to Pattari because 

00:01:16.530 --> 00:01:21.720
 There are cases, so I will tell you so please check this 

00:01:20.670 --> 00:01:29.130
 later 

00:01:21.720 --> 00:01:31.880
 Ask every time to check whether brake this is going up properly 

00:01:29.130 --> 00:01:36.250
 Sputtering even though you and I 

00:01:31.880 --> 00:01:37.790
 Even if I don't understand, I'm fine here 

00:01:36.250 --> 00:01:40.940
 I can not wrap 

00:01:37.790 --> 00:01:45.090
 But I Peta I come now to the heart manual Come of liver 

00:01:40.940 --> 00:01:49.980
 There are three but the left is the clutch pedal 

00:01:45.090 --> 00:01:56.340
 I 'll step into the depths of this storehouse tick 

00:01:49.980 --> 00:02:00.090
 Now the car is a manual car is made from deer and not depressed the clutch pedal 

00:01:56.340 --> 00:02:03.070
 Most of the things are already, but this car is not early 

00:02:00.090 --> 00:02:04.980
 If you eat it, let's get old 

00:02:03.070 --> 00:02:09.220
 It comes with 

00:02:04.980 --> 00:02:11.090
 Let's step on the brakes but now 

00:02:09.220 --> 00:02:12.840
 it is perfect 

00:02:11.090 --> 00:02:17.049
 In this state 

00:02:12.840 --> 00:02:18.470
 My name is the listening to the kindergarten 

00:02:17.049 --> 00:02:22.090
 Yes 

00:02:18.470 --> 00:02:25.019
 Pre-engine was able to star 

00:02:22.090 --> 00:02:25.019
 It will be said 

00:02:27.470 --> 00:02:31.700
 809 about 100 times a point 

00:02:32.190 --> 00:02:36.200
