 Hello Holger Biermann I'm without 

00:00:24.109 --> 00:00:25.460
 and not quite as wild 

00:00:25.460 --> 00:00:31.369
 and we'll show you how a question does not plant wheat or how 

00:00:31.369 --> 00:00:32.830
 always 

00:00:32.830 --> 00:00:35.830
 still percentage points how to get to bars 

00:00:37.270 --> 00:00:40.670
 The tank was accompanied by a band 

00:00:40.670 --> 00:00:43.240
 whether you're on 

00:00:43.240 --> 00:00:45.540
 and percent Ulrich material 

00:00:45.540 --> 00:00:48.540
 click 

00:00:49.590 --> 00:00:51.690
 in which one then in the hand 

00:00:51.690 --> 00:00:54.150
 only to a force field 

00:00:54.150 --> 00:00:57.150
 pressed under the right mouse button 

00:01:00.160 --> 00:01:03.370
 and that already 

00:01:03.370 --> 00:01:06.370
 "If you've collected long enough 

00:01:07.370 --> 00:01:10.580
 Kidman will be on his actual for modern looks 

00:01:11.930 --> 00:01:15.030
 and puts in the distance of a block 

00:01:15.030 --> 00:01:18.030
 Free Kramer 

00:01:28.800 --> 00:01:31.800
 old Mittelland side know questions put 

00:01:34.250 --> 00:01:35.429
 a title 

00:01:35.429 --> 00:01:36.370
 you have to do that 

00:01:36.370 --> 00:01:41.370
 The funds for this will roughly double in an impact with the 

00:01:41.370 --> 00:01:44.670
 British finally fought hard for making a celebrity 

00:01:44.670 --> 00:01:47.670
 Heldt wants to threaten Aigner 

00:01:49.400 --> 00:01:51.420
 then you will be in both corners 

00:01:51.420 --> 00:01:53.150
 continue 

00:01:53.150 --> 00:01:56.150
 and everyone should be facing St 

00:01:56.960 --> 00:01:58.460
 Canada holds the association 

00:01:58.460 --> 00:02:01.460
 were in midfield 

00:02:02.350 --> 00:02:04.440
 just again 

00:02:04.440 --> 00:02:06.680
 9 

00:02:06.680 --> 00:02:09.680
 Have SchÃ¶nberg 

00:02:16.489 --> 00:02:18.049
 while abolished 

00:02:18.049 --> 00:02:21.049
 then you take back his van son 

00:02:21.549 --> 00:02:24.199
 and applauded here 

00:02:24.199 --> 00:02:26.949
 how fast they are 

00:02:26.949 --> 00:02:28.429
 lie there 

00:02:28.429 --> 00:02:31.809
 to Winfried Bischoff next 5 

00:02:33.189 --> 00:02:36.189
 and 4 

00:02:38.749 --> 00:02:41.849
 Romance is more my opinion 

00:02:41.849 --> 00:02:45.609
 how do you rate it for that means that it worked secondly 

00:02:45.609 --> 00:02:48.169
 candidate 

00:02:48.169 --> 00:02:50.659
 Tweeted one gets easy 

00:02:50.659 --> 00:02:53.659
 still apply 

00:02:54.489 --> 00:02:57.980
 and in the near future when the beginning will bake 

00:03:00.269 --> 00:03:04.990
 SOK optional you can now probably synonymous glass or other 

00:03:04.990 --> 00:03:06.039
 real 

00:03:06.039 --> 00:03:08.359
 because of outdated bets occurs 

00:03:08.359 --> 00:03:13.260
 then you have to frolic on the pictures fields not more than complete 

00:03:13.259 --> 00:03:16.379
 Rest can come disturbed 

00:03:16.379 --> 00:03:19.379
 Here Probst was drifting 

00:03:21.599 --> 00:03:25.039
 around 

00:03:25.039 --> 00:03:28.189
 so you can on to Westerwald 

00:03:28.189 --> 00:03:30.689
 from her Schipplock 

00:03:30.689 --> 00:03:32.869
 Break outnumbered on a badge 

00:03:32.869 --> 00:03:35.869
 then grabbed me in the night 

00:03:39.959 --> 00:03:43.039
 so plan on clever net fooling 

00:03:43.039 --> 00:03:45.089
 the lay 

00:03:45.089 --> 00:03:48.589
 I'm fitter Bayreuth goal to drive again underground 

00:03:49.659 --> 00:03:52.179
 I use the whole area 

00:03:52.179 --> 00:03:53.839
 the family climbed 

00:03:53.839 --> 00:03:55.839
 and 

00:03:55.839 --> 00:03:59.749
 at a three times three field works so keep that stands yes 

00:03:59.749 --> 00:04:02.810
 Great with Anton Weiler think sold 

00:04:02.810 --> 00:04:05.769
 downstairs over bath bank 

00:04:05.769 --> 00:04:08.890
 and also the Cologne Cathedral Bloomberg reported now may also like 

00:04:10.499 --> 00:04:12.689
 but not that either 

00:04:12.689 --> 00:04:15.379
 Treuchtlingen funny another percent 

00:04:15.379 --> 00:04:18.199
 Source not only pumps 

00:04:18.199 --> 00:04:21.469
 are also treated under the title 

00:04:21.469 --> 00:04:24.499
 after Dieter really weird Aldi or rather over par 

00:04:25.020 --> 00:04:26.939
 Prof 

00:04:26.939 --> 00:04:29.939
 Travaglio expire 

00:04:33.219 --> 00:04:36.009
 the actor grabbed 

00:04:36.009 --> 00:04:39.009
 No 

00:04:39.779 --> 00:04:42.050
 we are waiting 

00:04:42.050 --> 00:04:44.270
 on 

00:04:44.270 --> 00:04:49.810
 since Vettel lied with another man we can not bring ourselves 

00:04:49.810 --> 00:04:51.689
 to explain 

00:04:51.689 --> 00:04:54.689
 no idea why betting wobbles with it 

00:04:56.830 --> 00:05:00.240
 I have less 

00:05:00.240 --> 00:05:03.240
 6 instead of 10 8 

00:05:08.770 --> 00:05:12.470
 Bush we have a daily at 8 8 percent 

00:05:13.550 --> 00:05:16.830
 Vol 

00:05:16.830 --> 00:05:21.080
 what are you going to do by far for further remaining baked baked 

00:05:22.069 --> 00:05:24.300
 and I have it for a short time, for example 

00:05:24.300 --> 00:05:27.620
 So here always by ten percent below plan partner needs 

00:05:42.349 --> 00:05:45.639
 a in the far country at the Lahn also quite concrete 

00:05:47.159 --> 00:05:50.159

00:05:55.860 --> 00:05:57.710
 Bread is made 

00:05:57.710 --> 00:06:01.980
 Lakic now wandered of course I do not believe a half-hearted main stage 

00:06:01.979 --> 00:06:03.770
 not hold 

00:06:03.770 --> 00:06:06.770

 subscribed changes and so on 

00:06:17.379 --> 00:06:20.240
 so everything has a tilting hours 

00:06:20.240 --> 00:06:25.699

00:06:27.839 --> 00:06:29.319
