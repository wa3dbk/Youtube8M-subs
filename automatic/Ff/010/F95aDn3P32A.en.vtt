the game but ideally you want the
carries<00:06:06.620> to<00:06:06.770> get<00:06:06.919> the<00:06:07.009> kills<00:06:07.219> see<00:06:08.000> a<00:06:08.029> good<00:06:08.360> use

00:06:08.619 --> 00:06:08.629 
carries to get the kills see a good use

00:06:08.629 --> 00:06:12.100 
carries to get the kills see a good use
of<00:06:08.900> my<00:06:09.770> box<00:06:10.159> up<00:06:10.430> there<00:06:10.460> at<00:06:10.759> the<00:06:10.819> top<00:06:10.909> it's<00:06:11.629> like

00:06:12.100 --> 00:06:12.110 
of my box up there at the top it's like

00:06:12.110 --> 00:06:13.930 
of my box up there at the top it's like
a<00:06:12.139> mini<00:06:12.379> ward<00:06:12.710> so<00:06:12.889> if<00:06:13.009> anyone<00:06:13.370> was<00:06:13.490> coming<00:06:13.520> down

00:06:13.930 --> 00:06:13.940 
a mini ward so if anyone was coming down

00:06:13.940 --> 00:06:16.629 
a mini ward so if anyone was coming down
to<00:06:14.120> top<00:06:14.360> to<00:06:14.719> attack<00:06:15.020> us<00:06:15.199> on<00:06:15.469> the<00:06:15.560> turret<00:06:15.949> we

00:06:16.629 --> 00:06:16.639 
to top to attack us on the turret we

00:06:16.639 --> 00:06:18.550 
to top to attack us on the turret we
could<00:06:16.819> not<00:06:16.969> only<00:06:17.000> see<00:06:17.509> them<00:06:17.719> coming<00:06:17.960> they

00:06:18.550 --> 00:06:18.560 
could not only see them coming they

00:06:18.560 --> 00:06:20.950 
could not only see them coming they
would<00:06:19.009> fear<00:06:19.279> them<00:06:19.520> for<00:06:19.759> a<00:06:19.819> certain<00:06:20.210> amount<00:06:20.810> of

00:06:20.950 --> 00:06:20.960 
would fear them for a certain amount of

00:06:20.960 --> 00:06:23.050 
would fear them for a certain amount of
time<00:06:21.229> so<00:06:21.740> we'd<00:06:22.129> have<00:06:22.279> a<00:06:22.310> good<00:06:22.400> opportunity<00:06:22.729> to

00:06:23.050 --> 00:06:23.060 
time so we'd have a good opportunity to

00:06:23.060 --> 00:06:25.570 
time so we'd have a good opportunity to
escape<00:06:23.409> also<00:06:24.409> another<00:06:24.620> ward<00:06:24.979> in<00:06:25.219> the<00:06:25.400> bush

00:06:25.570 --> 00:06:25.580 
escape also another ward in the bush

00:06:25.580 --> 00:06:27.490 
escape also another ward in the bush
they're<00:06:25.879> using<00:06:26.479> my<00:06:26.509> boxes<00:06:26.900> and<00:06:27.050> other<00:06:27.110> ward<00:06:27.379> if

they're using my boxes and other ward if

00:06:27.500 --> 00:06:29.290 
they're using my boxes and other ward if
anyone<00:06:27.800> goes<00:06:27.919> to<00:06:27.979> gank<00:06:28.339> bottom<00:06:28.699> they're<00:06:29.150> going

00:06:29.290 --> 00:06:29.300 
anyone goes to gank bottom they're going

00:06:29.300 --> 00:06:31.709 
anyone goes to gank bottom they're going
to<00:06:29.389> be<00:06:29.449> feared<00:06:29.779> so<00:06:30.080> we<00:06:30.199> can<00:06:30.349> see<00:06:30.620> them<00:06:30.710> and

00:06:31.709 --> 00:06:31.719 
to be feared so we can see them and

00:06:31.719 --> 00:06:34.600 
to be feared so we can see them and
they'll<00:06:32.719> be<00:06:32.839> feared<00:06:33.110> so<00:06:33.469> they<00:06:33.650> get<00:06:34.039> extra<00:06:34.430> time

00:06:34.600 --> 00:06:34.610 
they'll be feared so they get extra time

00:06:34.610 --> 00:06:36.670 
they'll be feared so they get extra time
