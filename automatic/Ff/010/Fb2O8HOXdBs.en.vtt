00:01:12.230 --> 00:01:12.240 
that a lot of times we have been so

demand<00:01:20.570> and<00:01:21.570> this<00:01:22.110> is<00:01:22.290> something<00:01:22.650> that<00:01:23.150> you

00:01:24.140 --> 00:01:24.150 
demand and this is something that you

00:01:24.150 --> 00:01:26.770 
demand and this is something that you
know<00:01:24.240> within<00:01:25.020> the<00:01:25.110> White<00:01:25.259> House<00:01:25.470> we<00:01:26.159> are

know within the White House we are

00:01:26.780 --> 00:01:29.780 
know within the White House we are
looking<00:01:27.780> at<00:01:27.930> very<00:01:28.200> carefully<00:01:28.439> as<00:01:29.189> I<00:01:29.369> said<00:01:29.640> it

00:01:29.780 --> 00:01:29.790 
looking at very carefully as I said it

00:01:29.790 --> 00:01:33.440 
looking at very carefully as I said it
is<00:01:29.820> well<00:01:30.479> the<00:01:31.700> some<00:01:32.700> of<00:01:32.820> this<00:01:32.970> requires

00:01:33.440 --> 00:01:33.450 
is well the some of this requires

00:01:33.450 --> 00:01:37.039 
is well the some of this requires
shifting<00:01:33.900> resources<00:01:35.060> being<00:01:36.060> strategic<00:01:36.299> where

shifting resources being strategic where

shifting resources being strategic where
does<00:01:37.229> it<00:01:37.350> make<00:01:37.530> sense<00:01:37.710> for<00:01:38.040> us<00:01:38.070> to<00:01:38.340> really

00:01:38.630 --> 00:01:38.640 
does it make sense for us to really

00:01:38.640 --> 00:01:41.480 
does it make sense for us to really
focus<00:01:38.729> on<00:01:39.150> interdiction<00:01:40.040> we<00:01:41.040> have<00:01:41.250> to<00:01:41.369> go

00:01:41.480 --> 00:01:41.490 
focus on interdiction we have to go

00:01:41.490 --> 00:01:44.600 
focus on interdiction we have to go
after<00:01:41.610> drug<00:01:41.909> cartels<00:01:42.420> that<00:01:42.829> not<00:01:43.829> only<00:01:44.040> are

00:01:44.600 --> 00:01:44.610 
after drug cartels that not only are

00:01:44.610 --> 00:01:46.160 
after drug cartels that not only are
selling<00:01:44.970> drugs<00:01:45.180> but<00:01:45.270> also<00:01:45.450> creating<00:01:45.990> havoc

for<00:01:46.710> example<00:01:47.810> along<00:01:48.810> the<00:01:49.610> us-mexican<00:01:50.610> border

00:01:51.100 --> 00:01:51.110 
for example along the us-mexican border

00:01:51.110 --> 00:01:53.480 
for example along the us-mexican border
but<00:01:52.110> are<00:01:52.470> there<00:01:52.740> ways<00:01:52.890> that<00:01:52.920> we<00:01:53.159> can<00:01:53.340> also

00:01:53.480 --> 00:01:53.490 
but are there ways that we can also

00:01:53.490 --> 00:01:57.260 
but are there ways that we can also
shrink<00:01:53.880> demand<00:01:54.299> and<00:01:55.430> you<00:01:56.430> know<00:01:56.520> in<00:01:56.640> some

00:01:57.260 --> 00:01:57.270 
shrink demand and you know in some

00:01:57.270 --> 00:01:59.359 
shrink demand and you know in some
cities<00:01:57.630> for<00:01:57.840> example<00:01:57.869> it<00:01:58.409> may<00:01:58.710> take<00:01:58.950> six

00:01:59.359 --> 00:01:59.369 
cities for example it may take six

00:01:59.369 --> 00:02:02.899 
cities for example it may take six
months<00:01:59.640> for<00:01:59.850> you<00:02:00.119> to<00:02:00.149> get<00:02:01.610> into<00:02:02.610> a<00:02:02.640> drug

that's pretty discouraging

00:02:12.260 --> 00:02:14.830 
that's pretty discouraging
and<00:02:12.590> so<00:02:12.920> we've<00:02:13.130> got<00:02:13.310> to<00:02:13.459> do<00:02:13.580> more<00:02:13.610> in<00:02:14.240> figuring

00:02:14.830 --> 00:02:14.840 
and so we've got to do more in figuring

00:02:14.840 --> 00:02:16.570 
and so we've got to do more in figuring
out<00:02:14.959> how<00:02:15.170> can<00:02:15.200> we<00:02:15.410> get<00:02:15.650> some<00:02:15.860> resources<00:02:16.040> on

00:02:16.570 --> 00:02:16.580 
out how can we get some resources on

00:02:16.580 --> 00:02:20.170 
out how can we get some resources on
that<00:02:16.760> end<00:02:16.940> of<00:02:17.090> it<00:02:17.650> and<00:02:18.650> make<00:02:18.890> sure<00:02:18.920> that<00:02:19.430> and

00:02:20.170 --> 00:02:20.180 
that end of it and make sure that and

00:02:20.180 --> 00:02:22.559 
that end of it and make sure that and
also<00:02:20.569> look<00:02:20.720> at<00:02:20.840> what<00:02:20.989> we<00:02:21.260> doing<00:02:21.500> when<00:02:21.650> we<00:02:21.680> have

00:02:22.559 --> 00:02:22.569 
also look at what we doing when we have

00:02:22.569 --> 00:02:26.620 
also look at what we doing when we have
nonviolent<00:02:24.250> first-time<00:02:25.250> drug<00:02:25.760> offenders<00:02:26.209> are

00:02:28.479 --> 00:02:28.489 
there ways that we can make sure that

00:02:28.489 --> 00:02:31.390 
there ways that we can make sure that
we're<00:02:28.970> steering<00:02:29.930> them<00:02:30.110> into<00:02:31.100> the<00:02:31.190> straight

00:02:31.390 --> 00:02:31.400 
we're steering them into the straight

00:02:31.400 --> 00:02:33.340 
we're steering them into the straight
and<00:02:31.580> narrow<00:02:31.720> without<00:02:32.720> automatically

00:02:33.340 --> 00:02:33.350 
and narrow without automatically

00:02:33.350 --> 00:02:36.790 
and narrow without automatically
resorting<00:02:33.950> to<00:02:34.690> to<00:02:35.690> incarceration<00:02:36.350> drug

00:02:36.790 --> 00:02:36.800 
resorting to to incarceration drug

00:02:36.800 --> 00:02:39.640 
resorting to to incarceration drug
courts<00:02:37.239> mechanisms<00:02:38.239> like<00:02:38.420> that<00:02:38.630> so<00:02:38.810> these<00:02:39.440> are

00:02:39.640 --> 00:02:39.650 
courts mechanisms like that so these are

00:02:39.650 --> 00:02:42.610 
courts mechanisms like that so these are
all<00:02:39.739> issues<00:02:39.920> that<00:02:40.130> are<00:02:40.400> worth<00:02:40.640> exploring<00:02:41.620> and

00:02:42.610 --> 00:02:42.620 
all issues that are worth exploring and

00:02:42.620 --> 00:02:46.840 
all issues that are worth exploring and
worth<00:02:43.370> of<00:02:43.519> worth<00:02:44.269> a<00:02:44.390> serious<00:02:44.720> debate
