today<00:00:06.690> we<00:00:06.810> hit<00:00:06.960> a<00:00:06.990> demo<00:00:07.259> and<00:00:07.529> Manfrotto<00:00:07.980> tripod

00:00:08.570 --> 00:00:08.580 
today we hit a demo and Manfrotto tripod

00:00:08.580 --> 00:00:11.900 
today we hit a demo and Manfrotto tripod
this<00:00:08.790> is<00:00:09.030> a<00:00:09.240> 502<00:00:09.860> HD<00:00:10.860> head<00:00:11.280> on<00:00:11.519> the<00:00:11.610> top<00:00:11.759> of<00:00:11.849> the

00:00:11.900 --> 00:00:11.910 
this is a 502 HD head on the top of the

00:00:11.910 --> 00:00:14.390 
this is a 502 HD head on the top of the
tripod<00:00:12.120> and<00:00:12.450> we've<00:00:12.929> got<00:00:13.139> some<00:00:13.440> seven<00:00:14.130> five

00:00:14.390 --> 00:00:14.400 
tripod and we've got some seven five

00:00:14.400 --> 00:00:16.880 
tripod and we've got some seven five
five<00:00:14.670> xB<00:00:15.269> legs<00:00:15.750> on<00:00:16.049> the<00:00:16.170> bottom<00:00:16.260> of<00:00:16.470> the<00:00:16.529> tripod

00:00:16.880 --> 00:00:16.890 
five xB legs on the bottom of the tripod

00:00:16.890 --> 00:00:18.650 
five xB legs on the bottom of the tripod
here<00:00:17.100> so<00:00:17.880> the<00:00:17.970> first<00:00:18.119> thing<00:00:18.270> I'm<00:00:18.390> going<00:00:18.420> to<00:00:18.539> do

00:00:18.650 --> 00:00:18.660 
here so the first thing I'm going to do

00:00:18.660 --> 00:00:20.210 
here so the first thing I'm going to do
is<00:00:18.900> open<00:00:19.230> up<00:00:19.260> the<00:00:19.380> legs<00:00:19.529> so<00:00:19.830> I<00:00:19.859> can<00:00:20.039> put<00:00:20.160> the

00:00:20.210 --> 00:00:20.220 
is open up the legs so I can put the

00:00:20.220 --> 00:00:22.849 
is open up the legs so I can put the
tripod<00:00:20.580> down<00:00:20.730> on<00:00:20.880> the<00:00:20.970> ground<00:00:21.180> you'll<00:00:21.720> see<00:00:22.020> at

00:00:22.849 --> 00:00:22.859 
tripod down on the ground you'll see at

00:00:22.859 --> 00:00:25.070 
tripod down on the ground you'll see at
the<00:00:23.010> bottom<00:00:23.160> of<00:00:23.460> the<00:00:23.939> legs<00:00:24.150> are<00:00:24.539> a<00:00:24.750> couple<00:00:24.930> of

00:00:25.070 --> 00:00:25.080 
the bottom of the legs are a couple of

00:00:25.080 --> 00:00:27.740 
the bottom of the legs are a couple of
clasps<00:00:25.650> we<00:00:26.070> need<00:00:26.189> to<00:00:26.340> pop<00:00:26.880> those<00:00:27.060> off<00:00:27.300> like<00:00:27.539> so

00:00:27.740 --> 00:00:27.750 
clasps we need to pop those off like so

00:00:27.750 --> 00:00:32.870 
clasps we need to pop those off like so
and<00:00:28.130> now<00:00:29.130> we<00:00:30.090> can<00:00:30.240> open<00:00:30.269> up<00:00:30.510> the<00:00:30.630> legs<00:00:31.880> now

00:00:32.870 --> 00:00:32.880 
and now we can open up the legs now

00:00:32.880 --> 00:00:35.540 
and now we can open up the legs now
there<00:00:33.120> are<00:00:33.239> two<00:00:33.570> clasps<00:00:34.469> on<00:00:34.680> the<00:00:34.829> legs<00:00:35.040> I'm

00:00:35.540 --> 00:00:35.550 
there are two clasps on the legs I'm

00:00:35.550 --> 00:00:36.920 
there are two clasps on the legs I'm
just<00:00:35.730> going<00:00:35.880> to<00:00:35.910> undo<00:00:36.180> one<00:00:36.510> of<00:00:36.600> them<00:00:36.719> because<00:00:36.899> I

00:00:36.920 --> 00:00:36.930 
just going to undo one of them because I

00:00:36.930 --> 00:00:38.869 
just going to undo one of them because I
don't<00:00:37.110> need<00:00:37.320> the<00:00:37.530> tripod<00:00:37.739> to<00:00:38.010> be<00:00:38.129> too<00:00:38.340> high<00:00:38.520> so

00:00:38.869 --> 00:00:38.879 
don't need the tripod to be too high so

00:00:38.879 --> 00:00:43.330 
don't need the tripod to be too high so
I'll<00:00:39.000> just<00:00:39.149> go<00:00:39.899> around<00:00:39.989> to<00:00:40.379> each<00:00:40.500> leg<00:00:40.770> and<00:00:41.870> undo

00:00:43.330 --> 00:00:43.340 
I'll just go around to each leg and undo

00:00:43.340 --> 00:00:46.400 
I'll just go around to each leg and undo
each<00:00:44.340> one<00:00:44.610> like<00:00:44.730> so<00:00:45.030> and<00:00:45.480> close<00:00:45.690> up<00:00:45.870> the<00:00:45.989> clasps

00:00:46.400 --> 00:00:46.410 
each one like so and close up the clasps

00:00:46.410 --> 00:00:49.100 
each one like so and close up the clasps
make<00:00:47.070> sure<00:00:47.190> the<00:00:47.340> legs<00:00:47.550> fully<00:00:47.850> extended<00:00:48.110> and

00:00:49.100 --> 00:00:49.110 
make sure the legs fully extended and

00:00:49.110 --> 00:00:52.310 
make sure the legs fully extended and
then<00:00:49.260> place<00:00:49.920> it<00:00:50.039> on<00:00:50.160> the<00:00:50.250> ground<00:00:51.079> just<00:00:52.079> twist

00:00:52.310 --> 00:00:52.320 
then place it on the ground just twist

00:00:52.320 --> 00:00:53.990 
then place it on the ground just twist
that<00:00:52.379> around<00:00:52.500> a<00:00:52.739> bit<00:00:52.860> the<00:00:53.579> next<00:00:53.610> thing<00:00:53.879> we're

00:00:53.990 --> 00:00:54.000 
that around a bit the next thing we're

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:56.150 
that around a bit the next thing we're
going<00:00:54.120> to<00:00:54.210> do<00:00:54.329> is<00:00:54.570> move<00:00:55.500> the<00:00:55.649> Panhandle

00:00:56.150 --> 00:00:56.160 
going to do is move the Panhandle

00:00:56.160 --> 00:00:58.069 
going to do is move the Panhandle
because<00:00:56.340> it's<00:00:56.460> locked<00:00:56.670> off<00:00:56.850> when<00:00:57.809> it's<00:00:57.899> in<00:00:57.989> the

00:00:58.069 --> 00:00:58.079 
because it's locked off when it's in the

00:00:58.079 --> 00:01:02.389 
because it's locked off when it's in the
bag<00:00:58.260> so<00:00:58.649> we'll<00:00:58.920> undo<00:01:00.109> that<00:01:01.250> move<00:01:02.250> the

00:01:02.389 --> 00:01:02.399 
bag so we'll undo that move the

00:01:02.399 --> 00:01:04.700 
bag so we'll undo that move the
Panhandle<00:01:03.000> out<00:01:03.149> so<00:01:03.629> it's<00:01:03.780> in<00:01:03.899> a<00:01:04.019> position

00:01:04.700 --> 00:01:04.710 
Panhandle out so it's in a position

00:01:04.710 --> 00:01:06.050 
Panhandle out so it's in a position
that's<00:01:04.860> going<00:01:05.070> to<00:01:05.129> be<00:01:05.189> comfortable<00:01:05.400> to<00:01:05.880> pan

00:01:06.050 --> 00:01:06.060 
that's going to be comfortable to pan

00:01:06.060 --> 00:01:11.030 
that's going to be comfortable to pan
with<00:01:06.270> and<00:01:07.020> then<00:01:08.030> we'll<00:01:09.030> tighten<00:01:09.299> that<00:01:09.479> up<00:01:10.040> now

00:01:11.030 --> 00:01:11.040 
with and then we'll tighten that up now

00:01:11.040 --> 00:01:13.969 
with and then we'll tighten that up now
with<00:01:11.250> respect<00:01:11.369> to<00:01:11.670> the<00:01:12.180> head<00:01:12.420> there<00:01:12.810> are<00:01:13.080> two

00:01:13.969 --> 00:01:13.979 
with respect to the head there are two

00:01:13.979 --> 00:01:15.740 
with respect to the head there are two
ways<00:01:14.130> we<00:01:14.159> can<00:01:14.400> move<00:01:14.549> it<00:01:14.729> we<00:01:14.820> can<00:01:15.000> pan<00:01:15.270> which<00:01:15.570> is

00:01:15.740 --> 00:01:15.750 
ways we can move it we can pan which is

00:01:15.750 --> 00:01:17.990 
ways we can move it we can pan which is
this<00:01:16.229> sort<00:01:16.470> of<00:01:16.530> motion<00:01:16.680> and<00:01:17.040> we<00:01:17.100> can<00:01:17.729> tilt

00:01:17.990 --> 00:01:18.000 
this sort of motion and we can tilt

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:20.330 
this sort of motion and we can tilt
which<00:01:18.270> is<00:01:18.479> this<00:01:18.810> sort<00:01:18.990> of<00:01:19.080> motion<00:01:19.259> and<00:01:19.619> there

00:01:20.330 --> 00:01:20.340 
which is this sort of motion and there

00:01:20.340 --> 00:01:22.310 
which is this sort of motion and there
are<00:01:20.430> ways<00:01:20.610> we<00:01:20.880> can<00:01:20.909> lock<00:01:21.540> both<00:01:21.960> of<00:01:22.170> those

00:01:22.310 --> 00:01:22.320 
are ways we can lock both of those

00:01:22.320 --> 00:01:23.780 
are ways we can lock both of those
things<00:01:22.619> and<00:01:22.830> there<00:01:23.070> are<00:01:23.159> ways<00:01:23.310> that<00:01:23.340> we<00:01:23.640> can

00:01:23.780 --> 00:01:23.790 
things and there are ways that we can

00:01:23.790 --> 00:01:25.310 
things and there are ways that we can
change<00:01:23.820> the<00:01:24.150> resistance<00:01:24.570> on<00:01:24.869> both<00:01:25.080> of<00:01:25.229> those

00:01:25.310 --> 00:01:25.320 
change the resistance on both of those

00:01:25.320 --> 00:01:27.590 
change the resistance on both of those
things<00:01:25.619> so<00:01:26.280> why<00:01:26.790> would<00:01:26.970> we<00:01:27.119> want<00:01:27.270> to<00:01:27.299> do<00:01:27.450> that

00:01:27.590 --> 00:01:27.600 
things so why would we want to do that

00:01:27.600 --> 00:01:28.910 
things so why would we want to do that
why<00:01:27.750> do<00:01:27.810> we<00:01:27.990> want<00:01:28.110> to<00:01:28.140> change<00:01:28.350> the<00:01:28.470> resistance

00:01:28.910 --> 00:01:28.920 
why do we want to change the resistance

00:01:28.920 --> 00:01:31.010 
why do we want to change the resistance
well<00:01:29.130> if<00:01:29.520> we<00:01:29.579> have<00:01:29.700> a<00:01:29.729> bigger<00:01:30.000> camera<00:01:30.479> on<00:01:30.630> the

00:01:31.010 --> 00:01:31.020 
well if we have a bigger camera on the

00:01:31.020 --> 00:01:32.899 
well if we have a bigger camera on the
tripod<00:01:31.380> head<00:01:31.799> then<00:01:32.280> we'll<00:01:32.460> probably<00:01:32.610> want

00:01:32.899 --> 00:01:32.909 
tripod head then we'll probably want

00:01:32.909 --> 00:01:34.550 
tripod head then we'll probably want
more<00:01:33.119> resistance<00:01:33.600> when<00:01:33.750> we're<00:01:33.930> moving<00:01:34.079> it<00:01:34.380> and

00:01:34.550 --> 00:01:34.560 
more resistance when we're moving it and

00:01:34.560 --> 00:01:35.870 
more resistance when we're moving it and
if<00:01:34.619> we<00:01:34.740> have<00:01:34.770> a<00:01:34.860> lighter<00:01:35.100> camera<00:01:35.520> will

00:01:35.870 --> 00:01:35.880 
if we have a lighter camera will

00:01:35.880 --> 00:01:38.120 
if we have a lighter camera will
probably<00:01:36.329> want<00:01:36.479> less<00:01:36.780> resistance<00:01:37.320> so<00:01:37.950> let's

00:01:38.120 --> 00:01:38.130 
probably want less resistance so let's

00:01:38.130 --> 00:01:40.160 
probably want less resistance so let's
look<00:01:38.250> at<00:01:38.400> both<00:01:38.549> those<00:01:38.790> things<00:01:39.000> firstly<00:01:39.840> the

00:01:40.160 --> 00:01:40.170 
look at both those things firstly the

00:01:40.170 --> 00:01:42.800 
look at both those things firstly the
panning<00:01:40.590> again<00:01:41.100> this<00:01:41.430> sort<00:01:41.610> of<00:01:41.729> motion<00:01:41.880> if<00:01:42.299> we

00:01:42.800 --> 00:01:42.810 
panning again this sort of motion if we

00:01:42.810 --> 00:01:44.179 
panning again this sort of motion if we
want<00:01:42.960> to<00:01:43.020> lock<00:01:43.290> that<00:01:43.530> so<00:01:43.860> we<00:01:43.979> can't

00:01:44.179 --> 00:01:44.189 
want to lock that so we can't

00:01:44.189 --> 00:01:46.190 
want to lock that so we can't
accidentally<00:01:44.759> pan<00:01:45.000> left<00:01:45.240> or<00:01:45.420> right<00:01:45.570> you'll

00:01:46.190 --> 00:01:46.200 
accidentally pan left or right you'll

00:01:46.200 --> 00:01:47.960 
accidentally pan left or right you'll
find<00:01:46.470> in<00:01:46.619> the<00:01:46.710> middle<00:01:46.920> here<00:01:47.100> bit<00:01:47.549> hard<00:01:47.729> to<00:01:47.790> see

00:01:47.960 --> 00:01:47.970 
find in the middle here bit hard to see

00:01:47.970 --> 00:01:49.850 
find in the middle here bit hard to see
there's<00:01:48.450> a<00:01:48.570> little<00:01:48.869> knob<00:01:49.290> that<00:01:49.439> we<00:01:49.560> can<00:01:49.680> twist

00:01:49.850 --> 00:01:49.860 
there's a little knob that we can twist

00:01:49.860 --> 00:01:52.730 
there's a little knob that we can twist
and<00:01:50.579> if<00:01:50.729> we<00:01:50.850> twist<00:01:51.030> that<00:01:51.180> around<00:01:51.530> and<00:01:52.530> tighten

00:01:52.730 --> 00:01:52.740 
and if we twist that around and tighten

00:01:52.740 --> 00:01:55.700 
and if we twist that around and tighten
it<00:01:52.920> up<00:01:52.979> now<00:01:53.960> you<00:01:54.960> know<00:01:55.049> I<00:01:55.079> have<00:01:55.290> to<00:01:55.409> put<00:01:55.560> some

00:01:55.700 --> 00:01:55.710 
it up now you know I have to put some

00:01:55.710 --> 00:01:57.709 
it up now you know I have to put some
fair<00:01:56.369> force<00:01:56.640> on<00:01:56.820> that<00:01:56.939> to<00:01:57.119> make<00:01:57.270> it<00:01:57.299> pan<00:01:57.540> left

00:01:57.709 --> 00:01:57.719 
fair force on that to make it pan left

00:01:57.719 --> 00:01:59.240 
fair force on that to make it pan left
and<00:01:57.930> right<00:01:58.049> and<00:01:58.350> you<00:01:58.649> don't<00:01:58.829> want<00:01:58.950> to<00:01:59.009> do<00:01:59.100> that

00:01:59.240 --> 00:01:59.250 
and right and you don't want to do that

00:01:59.250 --> 00:02:00.649 
and right and you don't want to do that
you<00:01:59.340> want<00:01:59.490> to<00:01:59.520> make<00:01:59.670> sure<00:01:59.700> it's<00:02:00.000> not<00:02:00.210> locked<00:02:00.479> if

00:02:00.649 --> 00:02:00.659 
you want to make sure it's not locked if

00:02:00.659 --> 00:02:02.480 
you want to make sure it's not locked if
you<00:02:00.780> are<00:02:00.899> going<00:02:01.049> to<00:02:01.140> pan<00:02:01.320> left<00:02:01.350> and<00:02:01.710> right<00:02:01.860> so

00:02:02.480 --> 00:02:02.490 
you are going to pan left and right so

00:02:02.490 --> 00:02:05.600 
you are going to pan left and right so
I'll<00:02:02.549> just<00:02:02.700> don't<00:02:02.880> do<00:02:03.000> that<00:02:03.149> again<00:02:04.369> if<00:02:05.369> I<00:02:05.549> do

00:02:05.600 --> 00:02:05.610 
I'll just don't do that again if I do

00:02:05.610 --> 00:02:07.670 
I'll just don't do that again if I do
want<00:02:05.939> to<00:02:06.060> adjust<00:02:06.240> the<00:02:06.750> friction<00:02:07.439> or<00:02:07.619> the

00:02:07.670 --> 00:02:07.680 
want to adjust the friction or the

00:02:07.680 --> 00:02:09.440 
want to adjust the friction or the
resistance<00:02:08.310> as<00:02:08.489> I'm<00:02:08.640> panning<00:02:08.970> left<00:02:09.149> and<00:02:09.300> right

00:02:09.440 --> 00:02:09.450 
resistance as I'm panning left and right

00:02:09.450 --> 00:02:12.770 
resistance as I'm panning left and right
there<00:02:10.229> is<00:02:10.410> this<00:02:10.649> red<00:02:11.220> ring<00:02:11.489> if<00:02:12.180> I<00:02:12.330> move<00:02:12.629> that

00:02:12.770 --> 00:02:12.780 
there is this red ring if I move that

00:02:12.780 --> 00:02:13.640 
there is this red ring if I move that
around

00:02:13.640 --> 00:02:13.650 
around

00:02:13.650 --> 00:02:16.070 
around
clockwise<00:02:14.459> looking<00:02:14.940> from<00:02:15.090> the<00:02:15.180> top<00:02:15.209> and<00:02:15.930> it's

00:02:16.070 --> 00:02:16.080 
clockwise looking from the top and it's

00:02:16.080 --> 00:02:17.630 
clockwise looking from the top and it's
going<00:02:16.230> to<00:02:16.319> add<00:02:16.440> more<00:02:16.890> resistance<00:02:17.040> so<00:02:17.519> this

00:02:17.630 --> 00:02:17.640 
going to add more resistance so this

00:02:17.640 --> 00:02:19.430 
going to add more resistance so this
would<00:02:17.760> be<00:02:17.849> useful<00:02:18.060> if<00:02:18.360> I<00:02:18.480> had<00:02:18.629> a<00:02:18.659> larger<00:02:18.870> camera

00:02:19.430 --> 00:02:19.440 
would be useful if I had a larger camera

00:02:19.440 --> 00:02:22.520 
would be useful if I had a larger camera
if<00:02:20.250> I<00:02:20.370> go<00:02:20.940> back<00:02:21.150> anti-clockwise<00:02:21.900> there's

00:02:22.520 --> 00:02:22.530 
if I go back anti-clockwise there's

00:02:22.530 --> 00:02:23.809 
if I go back anti-clockwise there's
going<00:02:22.680> to<00:02:22.739> be<00:02:22.799> less<00:02:23.010> resistance<00:02:23.519> and<00:02:23.700> it's

00:02:23.809 --> 00:02:23.819 
going to be less resistance and it's

00:02:23.819 --> 00:02:26.149 
going to be less resistance and it's
easier<00:02:24.120> for<00:02:24.150> me<00:02:24.299> to<00:02:24.390> move<00:02:24.769> in<00:02:25.769> terms<00:02:25.980> of<00:02:26.099> the

00:02:26.149 --> 00:02:26.159 
easier for me to move in terms of the

00:02:26.159 --> 00:02:27.830 
easier for me to move in terms of the
tilting<00:02:26.519> up<00:02:26.640> and<00:02:26.790> down<00:02:26.970> if<00:02:27.239> I<00:02:27.420> want<00:02:27.540> to<00:02:27.599> lock

00:02:27.830 --> 00:02:27.840 
tilting up and down if I want to lock

00:02:27.840 --> 00:02:29.570 
tilting up and down if I want to lock
that<00:02:28.019> off<00:02:28.170> entirely<00:02:28.620> so<00:02:29.280> I<00:02:29.310> can't

00:02:29.570 --> 00:02:29.580 
that off entirely so I can't

00:02:29.580 --> 00:02:32.720 
that off entirely so I can't
accidentally<00:02:30.060> do<00:02:30.180> it<00:02:30.299> this<00:02:31.230> knob<00:02:31.950> here<00:02:31.980> if<00:02:32.610> I

00:02:32.720 --> 00:02:32.730 
accidentally do it this knob here if I

00:02:32.730 --> 00:02:37.479 
accidentally do it this knob here if I
twist<00:02:33.030> that<00:02:33.120> around<00:02:34.459> now<00:02:35.459> I<00:02:35.760> can't<00:02:36.420> move<00:02:36.599> it

00:02:37.479 --> 00:02:37.489 
twist that around now I can't move it

00:02:37.489 --> 00:02:41.630 
twist that around now I can't move it
if<00:02:38.489> I<00:02:38.610> undo<00:02:38.909> it<00:02:39.030> now<00:02:39.890> I<00:02:40.890> can<00:02:41.129> fill<00:02:41.280> it<00:02:41.370> up<00:02:41.430> and

00:02:41.630 --> 00:02:41.640 
if I undo it now I can fill it up and

00:02:41.640 --> 00:02:44.059 
if I undo it now I can fill it up and
down<00:02:41.930> again<00:02:42.930> if<00:02:43.319> I<00:02:43.440> want<00:02:43.620> to<00:02:43.680> change<00:02:43.829> the

00:02:44.059 --> 00:02:44.069 
down again if I want to change the

00:02:44.069 --> 00:02:47.059 
down again if I want to change the
resistance<00:02:44.579> come<00:02:45.299> around<00:02:45.420> here<00:02:45.690> there<00:02:46.650> is<00:02:46.829> a

00:02:47.059 --> 00:02:47.069 
resistance come around here there is a

00:02:47.069 --> 00:02:49.460 
resistance come around here there is a
knob<00:02:47.430> for<00:02:47.670> that<00:02:47.849> on<00:02:48.000> the<00:02:48.090> other<00:02:48.209> side<00:02:48.480> so<00:02:48.959> if<00:02:49.319> I

00:02:49.460 --> 00:02:49.470 
knob for that on the other side so if I

00:02:49.470 --> 00:02:51.650 
knob for that on the other side so if I
twist<00:02:50.069> that<00:02:50.250> all<00:02:50.549> the<00:02:50.670> way<00:02:50.790> forward<00:02:51.060> just

00:02:51.650 --> 00:02:51.660 
twist that all the way forward just

00:02:51.660 --> 00:02:53.270 
twist that all the way forward just
basically<00:02:51.989> no<00:02:52.230> resistance<00:02:52.709> at<00:02:52.829> all<00:02:52.980> it<00:02:53.220> just

00:02:53.270 --> 00:02:53.280 
basically no resistance at all it just

00:02:53.280 --> 00:02:56.599 
basically no resistance at all it just
becomes<00:02:53.670> floppy<00:02:54.359> if<00:02:55.200> I<00:02:55.470> twist<00:02:56.190> that<00:02:56.310> all<00:02:56.519> the

00:02:56.599 --> 00:02:56.609 
becomes floppy if I twist that all the

00:02:56.609 --> 00:02:59.660 
becomes floppy if I twist that all the
way<00:02:56.730> back<00:02:57.000> then<00:02:57.980> there<00:02:58.980> is<00:02:59.099> quite<00:02:59.310> a<00:02:59.340> bit<00:02:59.519> of

00:02:59.660 --> 00:02:59.670 
way back then there is quite a bit of

00:02:59.670 --> 00:03:01.430 
way back then there is quite a bit of
resistance<00:02:59.909> so<00:03:00.329> much<00:03:00.480> so<00:03:00.690> that<00:03:00.720> the<00:03:01.230> tripod

00:03:01.430 --> 00:03:01.440 
resistance so much so that the tripod

00:03:01.440 --> 00:03:03.259 
resistance so much so that the tripod
actually<00:03:01.859> moves<00:03:02.069> if<00:03:02.190> I<00:03:02.370> don't<00:03:02.819> have<00:03:02.909> a<00:03:03.000> camera

00:03:03.259 --> 00:03:03.269 
actually moves if I don't have a camera

00:03:03.269 --> 00:03:05.539 
actually moves if I don't have a camera
on<00:03:03.359> top<00:03:03.420> so<00:03:04.409> what<00:03:04.739> you<00:03:04.859> need<00:03:05.010> to<00:03:05.069> do<00:03:05.370> is

00:03:05.539 --> 00:03:05.549 
on top so what you need to do is

00:03:05.549 --> 00:03:07.369 
on top so what you need to do is
basically<00:03:05.790> find<00:03:06.329> something<00:03:07.140> in<00:03:07.260> between

00:03:07.369 --> 00:03:07.379 
basically find something in between

00:03:07.379 --> 00:03:08.930 
basically find something in between
that's<00:03:07.829> suitable<00:03:08.220> for<00:03:08.400> the<00:03:08.489> camera<00:03:08.790> that

00:03:08.930 --> 00:03:08.940 
that's suitable for the camera that

00:03:08.940 --> 00:03:10.610 
that's suitable for the camera that
you're<00:03:09.030> using<00:03:09.390> if<00:03:09.959> you're<00:03:10.079> using<00:03:10.140> a<00:03:10.349> heavier

00:03:10.610 --> 00:03:10.620 
you're using if you're using a heavier

00:03:10.620 --> 00:03:11.869 
you're using if you're using a heavier
camera<00:03:11.010> you<00:03:11.220> probably<00:03:11.459> want<00:03:11.640> more<00:03:11.730> resistance

00:03:11.869 --> 00:03:11.879 
camera you probably want more resistance

00:03:11.879 --> 00:03:13.580 
camera you probably want more resistance
if<00:03:12.299> you're<00:03:12.420> using<00:03:12.540> a<00:03:12.690> lighter<00:03:12.870> camera<00:03:13.200> you

00:03:13.580 --> 00:03:13.590 
if you're using a lighter camera you

00:03:13.590 --> 00:03:17.149 
if you're using a lighter camera you
want<00:03:13.769> less<00:03:13.920> resistance<00:03:15.739> not<00:03:16.739> a<00:03:16.799> couple<00:03:17.069> of

00:03:17.149 --> 00:03:17.159 
want less resistance not a couple of

00:03:17.159 --> 00:03:20.539 
want less resistance not a couple of
features<00:03:17.280> of<00:03:17.489> the<00:03:17.970> tripod<00:03:18.569> itself<00:03:19.220> if<00:03:20.220> I<00:03:20.310> spin

00:03:20.539 --> 00:03:20.549 
features of the tripod itself if I spin

00:03:20.549 --> 00:03:22.309 
features of the tripod itself if I spin
that<00:03:20.669> around<00:03:20.730> and<00:03:21.359> you<00:03:21.569> might<00:03:21.750> need<00:03:21.959> to<00:03:22.139> zoom

00:03:22.309 --> 00:03:22.319 
that around and you might need to zoom

00:03:22.319 --> 00:03:24.259 
that around and you might need to zoom
in<00:03:22.440> for<00:03:22.590> this<00:03:22.709> Allen<00:03:22.980> there<00:03:23.609> is<00:03:23.760> a<00:03:23.790> level<00:03:24.120> that

00:03:24.259 --> 00:03:24.269 
in for this Allen there is a level that

00:03:24.269 --> 00:03:26.330 
in for this Allen there is a level that
you'll<00:03:24.419> find<00:03:24.660> here<00:03:24.780> so<00:03:25.380> if<00:03:25.500> you<00:03:25.620> are<00:03:25.769> on<00:03:26.040> uneven

00:03:26.330 --> 00:03:26.340 
you'll find here so if you are on uneven

00:03:26.340 --> 00:03:28.550 
you'll find here so if you are on uneven
ground<00:03:26.700> as<00:03:27.120> I<00:03:27.239> am<00:03:27.389> today<00:03:27.690> you<00:03:27.720> can<00:03:28.169> inspect

00:03:28.550 --> 00:03:28.560 
ground as I am today you can inspect

00:03:28.560 --> 00:03:30.050 
ground as I am today you can inspect
that<00:03:28.769> level<00:03:29.010> to<00:03:29.129> make<00:03:29.280> sure<00:03:29.430> the<00:03:29.609> things<00:03:29.760> are

00:03:30.050 --> 00:03:30.060 
that level to make sure the things are

00:03:30.060 --> 00:03:32.960 
that level to make sure the things are
as<00:03:30.269> level<00:03:30.540> as<00:03:30.569> they<00:03:30.780> possibly<00:03:31.109> can<00:03:31.290> be<00:03:31.349> on<00:03:31.970> top

00:03:32.960 --> 00:03:32.970 
as level as they possibly can be on top

00:03:32.970 --> 00:03:34.909 
as level as they possibly can be on top
of<00:03:33.150> the<00:03:33.359> tripod<00:03:33.599> we've<00:03:34.139> got<00:03:34.349> the<00:03:34.470> plate<00:03:34.709> and

00:03:34.909 --> 00:03:34.919 
of the tripod we've got the plate and

00:03:34.919 --> 00:03:37.129 
of the tripod we've got the plate and
this<00:03:35.370> is<00:03:35.519> what<00:03:35.760> you'll<00:03:36.299> take<00:03:36.540> off<00:03:36.720> and<00:03:36.989> then

00:03:37.129 --> 00:03:37.139 
this is what you'll take off and then

00:03:37.139 --> 00:03:38.869 
this is what you'll take off and then
mount<00:03:37.349> to<00:03:37.530> the<00:03:37.769> base<00:03:38.010> of<00:03:38.040> your<00:03:38.220> camera<00:03:38.669> so<00:03:38.849> you

00:03:38.869 --> 00:03:38.879 
mount to the base of your camera so you

00:03:38.879 --> 00:03:40.520 
mount to the base of your camera so you
can<00:03:39.090> install<00:03:39.329> the<00:03:39.450> camera<00:03:39.750> onto<00:03:40.049> the<00:03:40.139> tripod

00:03:40.520 --> 00:03:40.530 
can install the camera onto the tripod

00:03:40.530 --> 00:03:43.430 
can install the camera onto the tripod
head<00:03:40.879> now<00:03:41.879> to<00:03:41.940> get<00:03:42.239> this<00:03:42.359> thing<00:03:42.419> off<00:03:42.810> there<00:03:43.230> are

00:03:43.430 --> 00:03:43.440 
head now to get this thing off there are

00:03:43.440 --> 00:03:45.830 
head now to get this thing off there are
two<00:03:43.709> things<00:03:43.829> you<00:03:43.949> need<00:03:44.099> to<00:03:44.160> do<00:03:44.400> firstly<00:03:45.209> you

00:03:45.830 --> 00:03:45.840 
two things you need to do firstly you

00:03:45.840 --> 00:03:49.099 
two things you need to do firstly you
need<00:03:45.870> to<00:03:46.639> unlock<00:03:47.639> it<00:03:47.849> so<00:03:48.239> the<00:03:48.419> plate<00:03:48.629> lock<00:03:48.870> is

00:03:49.099 --> 00:03:49.109 
need to unlock it so the plate lock is

00:03:49.109 --> 00:03:52.069 
need to unlock it so the plate lock is
here<00:03:49.829> and<00:03:50.310> again<00:03:50.579> we<00:03:50.790> just<00:03:50.910> undo<00:03:51.449> that<00:03:51.629> take

00:03:52.069 --> 00:03:52.079 
here and again we just undo that take

00:03:52.079 --> 00:03:55.400 
here and again we just undo that take
the<00:03:52.169> tensions<00:03:52.500> off<00:03:52.650> and<00:03:52.919> then<00:03:54.139> the<00:03:55.139> plate

00:03:55.400 --> 00:03:55.410 
the tensions off and then the plate

00:03:55.410 --> 00:03:57.140 
the tensions off and then the plate
becomes<00:03:55.829> loose<00:03:56.099> but<00:03:56.699> it's<00:03:56.790> not<00:03:56.910> actually

00:03:57.140 --> 00:03:57.150 
becomes loose but it's not actually

00:03:57.150 --> 00:03:58.610 
becomes loose but it's not actually
going<00:03:57.180> to<00:03:57.359> come<00:03:57.540> off<00:03:57.720> just<00:03:57.750> yet<00:03:58.169> it's<00:03:58.379> still

00:03:58.610 --> 00:03:58.620 
going to come off just yet it's still

00:03:58.620 --> 00:04:02.689 
going to come off just yet it's still
got<00:03:58.919> a<00:03:58.949> safety<00:03:59.250> in<00:03:59.639> there<00:03:59.940> so<00:04:01.220> entirely<00:04:02.220> remove

00:04:02.689 --> 00:04:02.699 
got a safety in there so entirely remove

00:04:02.699 --> 00:04:05.509 
got a safety in there so entirely remove
the<00:04:02.819> plate<00:04:03.109> we<00:04:04.109> push<00:04:04.319> on<00:04:04.620> this<00:04:04.949> black<00:04:05.220> button

00:04:05.509 --> 00:04:05.519 
the plate we push on this black button

00:04:05.519 --> 00:04:09.020 
the plate we push on this black button
here<00:04:05.790> and<00:04:06.379> then<00:04:07.379> we<00:04:08.310> can<00:04:08.400> take<00:04:08.579> the<00:04:08.669> plate<00:04:08.879> out

00:04:09.020 --> 00:04:09.030 
here and then we can take the plate out

00:04:09.030 --> 00:04:12.559 
here and then we can take the plate out
entirely<00:04:09.799> so<00:04:10.799> on<00:04:11.069> the<00:04:11.310> plate<00:04:11.549> you'll<00:04:12.030> find<00:04:12.359> two

00:04:12.559 --> 00:04:12.569 
entirely so on the plate you'll find two

00:04:12.569 --> 00:04:14.809 
entirely so on the plate you'll find two
things<00:04:12.810> you've<00:04:13.079> got<00:04:13.290> this<00:04:13.440> gold<00:04:13.769> knob<00:04:14.459> here<00:04:14.730> at

00:04:14.809 --> 00:04:14.819 
things you've got this gold knob here at

00:04:14.819 --> 00:04:18.110 
things you've got this gold knob here at
the<00:04:14.910> front<00:04:15.260> so<00:04:16.260> this<00:04:16.440> is<00:04:16.590> the<00:04:17.190> the<00:04:17.519> lens<00:04:17.729> end<00:04:18.000> of

00:04:18.110 --> 00:04:18.120 
the front so this is the the lens end of

00:04:18.120 --> 00:04:19.969 
the front so this is the the lens end of
the<00:04:18.209> camera<00:04:18.510> that<00:04:18.660> goes<00:04:18.810> into<00:04:19.019> the<00:04:19.289> the<00:04:19.500> bottom

00:04:19.969 --> 00:04:19.979 
the camera that goes into the the bottom

00:04:19.979 --> 00:04:22.219 
the camera that goes into the the bottom
of<00:04:20.039> the<00:04:20.099> camera<00:04:20.459> facing<00:04:21.060> the<00:04:21.299> lens<00:04:21.510> and<00:04:21.810> then

00:04:22.219 --> 00:04:22.229 
of the camera facing the lens and then

00:04:22.229 --> 00:04:24.260 
of the camera facing the lens and then
you've<00:04:22.380> got<00:04:22.620> this<00:04:23.070> silver<00:04:23.400> screw<00:04:23.789> and<00:04:24.030> this<00:04:24.150> is

00:04:24.260 --> 00:04:24.270 
you've got this silver screw and this is

00:04:24.270 --> 00:04:26.270 
you've got this silver screw and this is
what<00:04:24.419> screws<00:04:24.750> into<00:04:24.960> the<00:04:25.140> the<00:04:25.830> base<00:04:26.010> of<00:04:26.190> the

00:04:26.270 --> 00:04:26.280 
what screws into the the base of the

00:04:26.280 --> 00:04:27.050 
what screws into the the base of the
camera<00:04:26.460> so

00:04:27.050 --> 00:04:27.060 
camera so

00:04:27.060 --> 00:04:31.550 
camera so
let's<00:04:27.210> do<00:04:27.360> that<00:04:27.510> now<00:04:29.930> I've<00:04:30.930> got<00:04:31.110> a<00:04:31.139> camera<00:04:31.320> here

00:04:31.550 --> 00:04:31.560 
let's do that now I've got a camera here

00:04:31.560 --> 00:04:33.650 
let's do that now I've got a camera here
with<00:04:31.710> me<00:04:31.860> and<00:04:32.460> you'll<00:04:32.639> see<00:04:32.820> on<00:04:33.030> the<00:04:33.210> bottom<00:04:33.570> of

00:04:33.650 --> 00:04:33.660 
with me and you'll see on the bottom of

00:04:33.660 --> 00:04:36.050 
with me and you'll see on the bottom of
the<00:04:33.750> camera<00:04:33.900> there<00:04:34.350> are<00:04:34.530> three<00:04:35.100> little<00:04:35.820> holes

00:04:36.050 --> 00:04:36.060 
the camera there are three little holes

00:04:36.060 --> 00:04:38.900 
the camera there are three little holes
now<00:04:36.840> with<00:04:37.620> respect<00:04:38.220> to<00:04:38.310> the<00:04:38.430> plate<00:04:38.610> we<00:04:38.760> only

00:04:38.900 --> 00:04:38.910 
now with respect to the plate we only

00:04:38.910 --> 00:04:40.400 
now with respect to the plate we only
need<00:04:39.120> to<00:04:39.210> actually<00:04:39.360> use<00:04:39.660> two<00:04:40.020> of<00:04:40.139> the<00:04:40.200> holes

00:04:40.400 --> 00:04:40.410 
need to actually use two of the holes

00:04:40.410 --> 00:04:42.950 
need to actually use two of the holes
the<00:04:41.250> middle<00:04:41.550> one<00:04:41.700> is<00:04:41.910> what<00:04:42.300> we'll<00:04:42.450> put<00:04:42.720> the

00:04:42.950 --> 00:04:42.960 
the middle one is what we'll put the

00:04:42.960 --> 00:04:45.860 
the middle one is what we'll put the
gold<00:04:43.410> nub<00:04:43.800> into<00:04:44.130> and<00:04:44.400> the<00:04:45.090> back<00:04:45.300> one<00:04:45.570> in<00:04:45.750> this

00:04:45.860 --> 00:04:45.870 
gold nub into and the back one in this

00:04:45.870 --> 00:04:48.110 
gold nub into and the back one in this
instance<00:04:46.290> is<00:04:46.500> what<00:04:46.710> I'm<00:04:46.800> going<00:04:46.919> to<00:04:47.010> screw<00:04:47.370> that

00:04:48.110 --> 00:04:48.120 
instance is what I'm going to screw that

00:04:48.120 --> 00:04:54.879 
instance is what I'm going to screw that
silver<00:04:48.510> screw<00:04:48.750> into<00:04:49.100> so<00:04:50.100> let's<00:04:50.130> do<00:04:50.400> that<00:04:50.460> now

00:04:54.879 --> 00:04:54.889 

00:04:54.889 --> 00:04:58.460 

get<00:04:55.889> it<00:04:55.980> on<00:04:56.070> there<00:04:56.220> nice<00:04:56.370> and<00:04:56.430> tight<00:04:56.639> so<00:04:57.470> the

00:04:58.460 --> 00:04:58.470 
get it on there nice and tight so the

00:04:58.470 --> 00:04:59.960 
get it on there nice and tight so the
camera<00:04:58.770> is<00:04:58.830> not<00:04:58.919> going<00:04:59.100> to<00:04:59.190> wobble<00:04:59.520> or<00:04:59.790> fall

00:04:59.960 --> 00:04:59.970 
camera is not going to wobble or fall

00:04:59.970 --> 00:05:02.629 
camera is not going to wobble or fall
off<00:05:00.150> and<00:05:00.419> now<00:05:01.229> I<00:05:01.470> will<00:05:01.680> spin<00:05:01.860> the<00:05:01.979> tripod<00:05:02.460> head

00:05:02.629 --> 00:05:02.639 
off and now I will spin the tripod head

00:05:02.639 --> 00:05:05.600 
off and now I will spin the tripod head
around<00:05:03.380> and<00:05:04.380> I'll<00:05:04.500> push<00:05:04.740> that<00:05:04.919> same<00:05:05.340> black

00:05:06.890 --> 00:05:06.900 
button that I was pushing earlier to

00:05:06.900 --> 00:05:09.530 
button that I was pushing earlier to
release<00:05:07.169> the<00:05:07.380> plate<00:05:07.590> and<00:05:08.040> I'll<00:05:08.669> slide<00:05:09.030> the

you'll<00:05:16.200> see<00:05:16.350> that<00:05:16.500> it<00:05:16.650> will<00:05:16.830> actually<00:05:17.280> slide

00:05:17.719 --> 00:05:17.729 
you'll see that it will actually slide

00:05:17.729 --> 00:05:20.690 
you'll see that it will actually slide
around<00:05:18.090> we<00:05:18.360> need<00:05:18.389> to<00:05:18.840> lock<00:05:19.710> it<00:05:19.889> in<00:05:20.070> place

00:05:20.690 --> 00:05:20.700 
around we need to lock it in place

00:05:20.700 --> 00:05:23.210 
around we need to lock it in place
spin<00:05:21.389> that<00:05:21.510> around<00:05:21.570> for<00:05:21.960> you<00:05:22.080> using<00:05:22.650> this

fastener<00:05:23.639> here<00:05:26.840> and<00:05:27.840> now<00:05:28.080> if<00:05:28.740> I<00:05:28.889> pan<00:05:29.130> all<00:05:29.340> the

00:05:29.420 --> 00:05:29.430 
fastener here and now if I pan all the

00:05:29.430 --> 00:05:31.040 
fastener here and now if I pan all the
way<00:05:29.550> down<00:05:29.760> or<00:05:30.000> pan<00:05:30.180> all<00:05:30.330> the<00:05:30.419> way<00:05:30.540> up<00:05:30.660> the

00:05:34.250 --> 00:05:34.260 
camera is going to stay in place finally

00:05:34.260 --> 00:05:36.830 
camera is going to stay in place finally
I<00:05:34.410> need<00:05:34.530> to<00:05:34.800> level<00:05:35.039> the<00:05:35.250> tripod<00:05:35.700> you<00:05:36.419> may<00:05:36.780> be

00:05:36.830 --> 00:05:36.840 
I need to level the tripod you may be

00:05:36.840 --> 00:05:39.200 
I need to level the tripod you may be
able<00:05:37.080> to<00:05:37.169> see<00:05:37.680> there<00:05:37.919> that<00:05:37.950> it's<00:05:38.220> not<00:05:38.280> as<00:05:38.610> level

00:05:39.200 --> 00:05:39.210 
able to see there that it's not as level

00:05:39.210 --> 00:05:41.510 
able to see there that it's not as level
as<00:05:39.360> it<00:05:39.450> could<00:05:39.630> be<00:05:39.830> down<00:05:40.830> the<00:05:41.039> bottom<00:05:41.280> of<00:05:41.400> the

00:05:41.510 --> 00:05:41.520 
as it could be down the bottom of the

00:05:41.520 --> 00:05:44.420 
as it could be down the bottom of the
tripod<00:05:42.350> underneath<00:05:43.350> the<00:05:43.530> head<00:05:43.680> itself<00:05:43.979> you'll

00:05:44.420 --> 00:05:44.430 
tripod underneath the head itself you'll

00:05:44.430 --> 00:05:47.719 
tripod underneath the head itself you'll
find<00:05:44.669> this<00:05:44.820> extending<00:05:45.479> pole<00:05:45.720> now<00:05:46.650> this<00:05:46.979> can<00:05:47.700> be

00:05:47.719 --> 00:05:47.729 
find this extending pole now this can be

00:05:47.729 --> 00:05:50.000 
find this extending pole now this can be
used<00:05:47.850> to<00:05:48.210> raise<00:05:48.630> the<00:05:48.840> tripod<00:05:49.289> up<00:05:49.440> even<00:05:49.800> further

00:05:50.000 --> 00:05:50.010 
used to raise the tripod up even further

00:05:50.010 --> 00:05:52.490 
used to raise the tripod up even further
if<00:05:50.280> you<00:05:50.310> need<00:05:50.610> to<00:05:50.820> there's<00:05:51.150> a<00:05:51.210> little<00:05:51.930> faster

00:05:52.490 --> 00:05:52.500 
if you need to there's a little faster

00:05:52.500 --> 00:05:55.850 
if you need to there's a little faster
over<00:05:52.800> here<00:05:53.010> and<00:05:53.340> if<00:05:53.580> we<00:05:53.910> undid<00:05:54.510> that<00:05:54.680> we<00:05:55.680> could

00:05:55.850 --> 00:05:55.860 
over here and if we undid that we could

00:05:55.860 --> 00:05:57.830 
over here and if we undid that we could
raise<00:05:56.010> up<00:05:56.190> the<00:05:56.280> neck<00:05:56.460> and<00:05:56.669> get<00:05:57.210> even<00:05:57.479> higher<00:05:57.690> if

00:05:57.830 --> 00:05:57.840 
raise up the neck and get even higher if

00:05:57.840 --> 00:05:59.659 
raise up the neck and get even higher if
we<00:05:57.900> needed<00:05:58.260> to<00:05:58.410> like<00:05:58.740> so<00:05:58.979> but<00:05:59.430> we'll<00:05:59.639> just

00:05:59.659 --> 00:05:59.669 
we needed to like so but we'll just

00:05:59.669 --> 00:06:02.240 
we needed to like so but we'll just
tighten<00:06:00.000> that<00:06:00.060> up<00:06:00.180> for<00:06:00.360> now<00:06:00.800> what<00:06:01.800> we<00:06:01.950> want<00:06:02.190> to

00:06:02.240 --> 00:06:02.250 
tighten that up for now what we want to

00:06:02.250 --> 00:06:05.330 
tighten that up for now what we want to
do<00:06:02.400> is<00:06:02.639> make<00:06:03.479> this<00:06:03.630> whole<00:06:03.870> thing<00:06:04.080> level<00:06:04.410> so<00:06:05.310> to

00:06:05.330 --> 00:06:05.340 
do is make this whole thing level so to

00:06:05.340 --> 00:06:08.510 
do is make this whole thing level so to
do<00:06:05.820> that<00:06:06.139> I'm<00:06:07.139> going<00:06:07.289> to<00:06:07.350> unscrew<00:06:07.950> this<00:06:08.160> and

00:06:08.510 --> 00:06:08.520 
do that I'm going to unscrew this and

00:06:08.520 --> 00:06:10.879 
do that I'm going to unscrew this and
you'll<00:06:08.880> see<00:06:09.120> now<00:06:09.330> that<00:06:09.360> quite<00:06:10.020> floppy<00:06:10.680> it

00:06:10.879 --> 00:06:10.889 
you'll see now that quite floppy it

00:06:10.889 --> 00:06:12.830 
you'll see now that quite floppy it
moves<00:06:11.100> around<00:06:11.250> and<00:06:11.610> goes<00:06:11.820> left<00:06:12.330> and<00:06:12.510> right<00:06:12.660> up

00:06:12.830 --> 00:06:12.840 
moves around and goes left and right up

00:06:12.840 --> 00:06:15.260 
moves around and goes left and right up
and<00:06:12.930> down<00:06:13.280> so<00:06:14.280> this<00:06:14.370> is<00:06:14.520> really<00:06:14.700> beneficial<00:06:14.850> if

00:06:15.260 --> 00:06:15.270 
and down so this is really beneficial if

00:06:15.270 --> 00:06:17.270 
and down so this is really beneficial if
you<00:06:15.389> are<00:06:15.510> on<00:06:15.810> uneven<00:06:16.139> ground<00:06:16.380> as<00:06:16.740> we<00:06:16.860> are<00:06:17.010> here

00:06:17.270 --> 00:06:17.280 
you are on uneven ground as we are here

00:06:17.280 --> 00:06:19.670 
you are on uneven ground as we are here
I'm<00:06:18.150> gonna<00:06:18.360> use<00:06:18.539> the<00:06:18.660> level<00:06:18.960> on<00:06:19.139> the<00:06:19.229> back<00:06:19.440> of

00:06:19.670 --> 00:06:19.680 
I'm gonna use the level on the back of

00:06:19.680 --> 00:06:24.200 
I'm gonna use the level on the back of
this<00:06:19.860> 502<00:06:20.789> head<00:06:22.250> well<00:06:23.250> there<00:06:23.669> we<00:06:23.760> go<00:06:23.789> it<00:06:24.150> should

00:06:24.200 --> 00:06:24.210 
this 502 head well there we go it should

00:06:24.210 --> 00:06:26.690 
this 502 head well there we go it should
be<00:06:24.419> level<00:06:24.630> now<00:06:24.870> I'll<00:06:25.770> screw<00:06:26.010> it<00:06:26.130> back<00:06:26.310> into

00:06:26.690 --> 00:06:26.700 
be level now I'll screw it back into

00:06:26.700 --> 00:06:29.210 
be level now I'll screw it back into
place<00:06:26.970> and<00:06:27.440> now<00:06:28.440> we<00:06:28.500> know<00:06:28.710> that<00:06:28.740> when<00:06:29.039> we're

00:06:29.210 --> 00:06:29.220 
place and now we know that when we're

00:06:29.220 --> 00:06:30.500 
place and now we know that when we're
recording<00:06:29.580> we're<00:06:29.970> actually<00:06:30.090> going<00:06:30.300> to<00:06:30.389> get<00:06:30.450> a

00:06:30.500 --> 00:06:30.510 
recording we're actually going to get a

00:06:30.510 --> 00:06:32.570 
recording we're actually going to get a
level<00:06:30.690> shot<00:06:31.080> with<00:06:31.289> no<00:06:31.530> weed<00:06:31.919> horizons<00:06:32.520> or

00:06:32.570 --> 00:06:32.580 
level shot with no weed horizons or

00:06:32.580 --> 00:06:33.370 
level shot with no weed horizons or
anything<00:06:32.789> like<00:06:32.970> that

00:06:33.370 --> 00:06:33.380 
anything like that

00:06:33.380 --> 00:06:35.779 
anything like that
now<00:06:34.380> this<00:06:34.560> feels<00:06:34.770> pretty<00:06:34.830> good<00:06:35.250> I<00:06:35.280> might<00:06:35.580> just

00:06:35.779 --> 00:06:35.789 
now this feels pretty good I might just

00:06:35.789 --> 00:06:37.490 
now this feels pretty good I might just
go<00:06:35.940> through<00:06:36.240> and<00:06:36.450> play<00:06:36.690> with<00:06:36.930> the<00:06:37.020> tensioners

00:06:37.490 --> 00:06:37.500 
go through and play with the tensioners

00:06:37.500 --> 00:06:40.730 
go through and play with the tensioners
maybe<00:06:37.890> add<00:06:38.520> a<00:06:38.580> bit<00:06:38.789> more<00:06:38.820> drag<00:06:39.630> to<00:06:40.020> my<00:06:40.289> pan

00:06:40.730 --> 00:06:40.740 
maybe add a bit more drag to my pan

00:06:40.740 --> 00:06:42.950 
maybe add a bit more drag to my pan
until<00:06:41.580> you<00:06:41.730> come<00:06:42.060> up<00:06:42.210> with<00:06:42.240> something<00:06:42.840> that

00:06:42.950 --> 00:06:42.960 
until you come up with something that

00:06:42.960 --> 00:06:45.980 
until you come up with something that
feels<00:06:43.260> natural<00:06:44.000> something<00:06:45.000> that<00:06:45.210> gives<00:06:45.900> a

00:06:45.980 --> 00:06:45.990 
feels natural something that gives a

00:06:45.990 --> 00:06:47.420 
feels natural something that gives a
little<00:06:46.170> bit<00:06:46.410> of<00:06:46.500> resistance<00:06:46.770> so<00:06:47.160> you<00:06:47.250> need<00:06:47.400> a

00:06:47.420 --> 00:06:47.430 
little bit of resistance so you need a

00:06:47.430 --> 00:06:49.160 
little bit of resistance so you need a
little<00:06:47.760> bit<00:06:47.910> of<00:06:48.000> pressure<00:06:48.210> but<00:06:48.600> you<00:06:49.020> don't

00:06:49.160 --> 00:06:49.170 
little bit of pressure but you don't

00:06:49.170 --> 00:06:50.510 
little bit of pressure but you don't
want<00:06:49.290> to<00:06:49.350> have<00:06:49.440> too<00:06:49.590> much<00:06:49.740> force<00:06:50.040> not<00:06:50.250> so<00:06:50.370> much

00:06:50.510 --> 00:06:50.520 
want to have too much force not so much

00:06:50.520 --> 00:06:52.370 
want to have too much force not so much
for<00:06:50.760> stick<00:06:51.030> the<00:06:51.150> whole<00:06:51.270> tripod<00:06:51.750> tips<00:06:52.020> over

00:06:52.370 --> 00:06:52.380 
for stick the whole tripod tips over

00:06:52.380 --> 00:06:54.620 
for stick the whole tripod tips over
once<00:06:53.160> you're<00:06:53.310> happy<00:06:53.370> with<00:06:53.550> that<00:06:53.790> you're<00:06:54.480> ready

00:06:54.620 --> 00:06:54.630 
once you're happy with that you're ready

00:06:54.630 --> 00:06:57.140 
once you're happy with that you're ready
to<00:06:54.780> start<00:06:54.960> filming
