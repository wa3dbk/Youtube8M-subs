00:00:07.160 --> 00:00:13.590
 Hi everyone guys Tim what I want 

00:00:10.469 --> 00:00:15.920
 say just got me questions on 

00:00:13.590 --> 00:00:17.940
 about the engine of these just already boiled 

00:00:15.920 --> 00:00:20.220
 started gritting his teeth 

00:00:17.940 --> 00:00:22.050
 explaining this song to familiar miscellaneous 

00:00:20.220 --> 00:00:24.269
 who engaged in technique gave tact 

00:00:22.050 --> 00:00:26.400
 four stroke someone maybe what i 

00:00:24.269 --> 00:00:28.650
 I will tell from the usual interest 

00:00:26.400 --> 00:00:31.080
 truism for someone inexperienced 

00:00:28.650 --> 00:00:33.780
 maybe you will be interested judged bye 

00:00:31.080 --> 00:00:35.040
 often pull their belly and know 

00:00:33.780 --> 00:00:37.440
 questions like this why it won't start 

00:00:35.040 --> 00:00:39.960
 why is she there why does not hold idle 

00:00:37.440 --> 00:00:41.430
 but all sorts of reasons why I wanted to clarify 

00:00:39.960 --> 00:00:43.379
 when you assemble a two-stroke engine 

00:00:41.430 --> 00:00:46.079
 any two-stroke engines 

00:00:43.379 --> 00:00:47.270
 The main thing is that you are a magic camera where 

00:00:46.079 --> 00:00:49.320
 rotates pecked 

00:00:47.270 --> 00:00:52.620
 under on crank cameras and fingers 

00:00:49.320 --> 00:00:55.379
 show it should be tough to say 

00:00:52.620 --> 00:01:00.539
 so sealed ie gland 

00:00:55.379 --> 00:01:04.199
 standing on one side right here right here 

00:01:00.539 --> 00:01:05.700
 It is worth one special bearing 

00:01:04.199 --> 00:01:06.950
 worth the other side here he is clearly visible 

00:01:05.700 --> 00:01:09.030
 the whole 

00:01:06.950 --> 00:01:10.860
 something like this story at all 

00:01:09.030 --> 00:01:14.490
 two-stroke engines but it happens 

00:01:10.860 --> 00:01:18.840
 two integral ultu 3 but here's the main thing 

00:01:14.490 --> 00:01:23.930
 to crank camera date place where 

00:01:18.840 --> 00:01:26.670
 lies crankshaft was tough 

00:01:23.930 --> 00:01:28.950
 sealed with glands 

00:01:26.670 --> 00:01:32.490
 laying which on a head under 

00:01:28.950 --> 00:01:37.020
 the cylinder is put here must also air 

00:01:32.490 --> 00:01:40.040
 and suck it all just when you collect 

00:01:37.020 --> 00:01:44.930
 everything must be done hard then 

00:01:40.040 --> 00:01:48.509
 when you put gaskets these windows 

00:01:44.930 --> 00:01:51.950
 product they must not be blocked 

00:01:48.509 --> 00:01:54.000
 it still happens more 

00:01:51.950 --> 00:01:54.470
 gasket did the shop stick out on 

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:57.719
 the street 

00:01:54.470 --> 00:02:00.270
 strongly and here there are products strongly 

00:01:57.719 --> 00:02:04.799
 blocking good little fight no one 

00:02:00.270 --> 00:02:09.410
 these windows too forget to get out well 

00:02:04.799 --> 00:02:13.610
 that is, a lot of shoals here 

00:02:09.410 --> 00:02:15.410
 This is for the beginning and many think let's say 

00:02:13.610 --> 00:02:19.120
 there opened thundered knock appeared 

00:02:15.410 --> 00:02:22.340
 January, that is why it does not start 

00:02:19.120 --> 00:02:26.600
 business or bad guys knock 

00:02:22.340 --> 00:02:29.030
 appears due to the fact that the hatch appears 

00:02:26.600 --> 00:02:30.560
 but this is not the cause of a bad launch 

00:02:29.030 --> 00:02:32.960
 generally have a loose crankshaft 

00:02:30.560 --> 00:02:35.330
 completely dead nomad but there will be some 

00:02:32.960 --> 00:02:37.300
 call she will knock at work here 

00:02:35.330 --> 00:02:41.240
 so that 

00:02:37.300 --> 00:02:44.420
 oil seals and bearings on this side 

00:02:41.240 --> 00:02:50.120
 this is clearly not even discussed 

00:02:44.420 --> 00:02:52.430
 but seals about them can not be forgotten from that 

00:02:50.120 --> 00:02:55.100
 left side, that is, let's say 

00:02:52.430 --> 00:02:57.110
 scattered on nameplates are dead they 

00:02:55.100 --> 00:02:58.010
 will knock will make sounds at 

00:02:57.110 --> 00:03:00.230
 crankshaft rotation 

00:02:58.010 --> 00:03:02.660
 but this is not the cause of a bad start bad 

00:03:00.230 --> 00:03:04.310
 launch from the number of rooks 

00:03:02.660 --> 00:03:09.440
 sealed it turns out that instead of 

00:03:04.310 --> 00:03:13.370
 to suck carb mixture help 

00:03:09.440 --> 00:03:15.610
 on i suck the air from the street or oil from 

00:03:13.370 --> 00:03:18.110
 gear boxes 

00:03:15.610 --> 00:03:20.360
 so what about the glands do not forget this time 

00:03:18.110 --> 00:03:22.700
 then stuffing good everything is good 

00:03:20.360 --> 00:03:25.570
 bearings live everything is fine screen 

00:03:22.700 --> 00:03:28.790
 shaft at the start of the bad look piston 

00:03:25.570 --> 00:03:30.290
 Well, it is clear they should not hang out like 

00:03:28.790 --> 00:03:33.610
 and should not be much that is closed 

00:03:30.290 --> 00:03:37.610
 you need to be very dense that the book 

00:03:33.610 --> 00:03:39.650
 the gap on the rings norba man up to 

00:03:37.610 --> 00:03:43.010
 usually for this engine this fps and a 

00:03:39.650 --> 00:03:45.140
 76 cylinder diameter lock on the rings 

00:03:43.010 --> 00:03:46.910
 two tenths of a millimeter is allowed here 

00:03:45.140 --> 00:03:49.340
 new can not be less 

00:03:46.910 --> 00:03:50.870
 rings heats the lock rests one 

00:03:49.340 --> 00:03:52.610
 another can break a finger or just 

00:03:50.870 --> 00:03:55.190
 return that is in other words even 

00:03:52.610 --> 00:03:57.410
 The set is good if there is no compression then 

00:03:55.190 --> 00:03:59.209
 the engine will not have idle speed 

00:03:57.410 --> 00:04:00.800
 will be a very bad launch well naturally 

00:03:59.209 --> 00:04:02.840
 will not go and will regress in 

00:04:00.800 --> 00:04:04.580
 common when identifying 

00:04:02.840 --> 00:04:06.770
 some faults or there 

00:04:04.580 --> 00:04:08.420
 troubleshooting 2 all go through the chain all 

00:04:06.770 --> 00:04:10.670
 starts open let's say everything 

00:04:08.420 --> 00:04:12.680
 crank camera all good all all 

00:04:10.670 --> 00:04:14.660
 Hood then the spark test begins 

00:04:12.680 --> 00:04:16.130
 ignition timing where 

00:04:14.660 --> 00:04:17.280
 need for those who do not know what is 

00:04:16.130 --> 00:04:19.350
 advance 

00:04:17.280 --> 00:04:20.310
 or you ignition yourself everything is very simple 

00:04:19.350 --> 00:04:25.669
 fashion 

00:04:20.310 --> 00:04:28.260
 with his work items from here and there and 

00:04:25.669 --> 00:04:29.970
 during the next stroke of the working piston 

00:04:28.260 --> 00:04:36.150
 rises veto let's say comes to 

00:04:29.970 --> 00:04:38.970
 the top is very ps and there let's say there 322 and 

00:04:36.150 --> 00:04:41.400
 832 advances do not reach the top in 

00:04:38.970 --> 00:04:43.110
 this point 28 32 millimeters if 

00:04:41.400 --> 00:04:44.820
 let's need it too late then 

00:04:43.110 --> 00:04:46.080
 there is already he passed the upper iris 

00:04:44.820 --> 00:04:48.300
 goes down too late 

00:04:46.080 --> 00:04:51.570
 Ignition too happy when allowed 

00:04:48.300 --> 00:04:54.360
 the piston is underneath here not 

00:04:51.570 --> 00:04:56.669
 here that's when 38 millimeters like this 

00:04:54.360 --> 00:04:58.080
 here it is too earlier to be very 

00:04:56.669 --> 00:05:00.690
 strongly beat the new motor, too, go not 

00:04:58.080 --> 00:05:02.610
 Ilya will be all mixed in one pile with us 

00:05:00.690 --> 00:05:05.190
 as is often thought that the price of 4 there 

00:05:02.610 --> 00:05:06.990
 clutch leads Ali slips up to 100,000 and 

00:05:05.190 --> 00:05:07.919
 for it is bad to start that is all 

00:05:06.990 --> 00:05:11.880
 mixed one pile 

00:05:07.919 --> 00:05:14.100
 for them there is no lust there further they 

00:05:11.880 --> 00:05:17.400
 think that everything connected on the motor 

00:05:14.100 --> 00:05:18.660
 connected connected but usually engine 

00:05:17.400 --> 00:05:20.130
 you can work fine without a box 

00:05:18.660 --> 00:05:23.040
 gears there is no gearbox 

00:05:20.130 --> 00:05:25.320
 teach us there is no clutch itself by 

00:05:23.040 --> 00:05:27.300
 motom viewers 

00:05:25.320 --> 00:05:27.750
 this camera crankshaft cylinder is 

00:05:27.300 --> 00:05:31.650
 engine 

00:05:27.750 --> 00:05:33.450
 all that docked to him in the form of here 

00:05:31.650 --> 00:05:36.690
 these gears 1 before the piece of iron 

00:05:33.450 --> 00:05:38.100
 assholes this gearbox and without it 

00:05:36.690 --> 00:05:39.600
 it will work fine just him 

00:05:38.100 --> 00:05:41.789
 200 will be difficult then there is no kickstarter 

00:05:39.600 --> 00:05:44.700
 but if we start let's say I don’t know 2 

00:05:41.789 --> 00:05:46.800
 or is there some kind of key to spin it 

00:05:44.700 --> 00:05:49.410
 will work and we mix everything 

00:05:46.800 --> 00:05:51.510
 heap in one stack and one other 

00:05:49.410 --> 00:05:53.070
 grabs everything literally all posts can 

00:05:51.510 --> 00:05:56.070
 offer there is everything broken broken incomprehensible 

00:05:53.070 --> 00:05:57.330
 where to climb and for this is the typical story 

00:05:56.070 --> 00:05:59.310
 from water debts 

00:05:57.330 --> 00:06:01.260
 just dedicated to the boys not 

00:05:59.310 --> 00:06:02.700
 lie or for a long time and didn't beat down 

00:06:01.260 --> 00:06:05.070
 getting to where you don't need 

00:06:02.700 --> 00:06:10.700
 by the way wanted to show here is one of 

00:06:05.070 --> 00:06:10.700
 examples of such interesting 

00:06:11.780 --> 00:06:19.850
 such a fix is ​​interesting here you see yes 

00:06:15.050 --> 00:06:25.300
 piles so he made beautiful the fact that he 

00:06:19.850 --> 00:06:25.300
 did not jump out on the street drink this miracle yes 

00:06:26.560 --> 00:06:34.480
 Also Cyc Well, but about the assembly itself 

00:06:31.940 --> 00:06:37.250
 I have already said that if we say so 

00:06:34.480 --> 00:06:39.080
 collect case and it is not clear that 0 or 

00:06:37.250 --> 00:06:41.030
 pass and we went so called 

00:06:39.080 --> 00:06:43.610
 simple assembly well naturally 

00:06:41.030 --> 00:06:45.410
 from this assembly bulk anywhere themselves 

00:06:43.610 --> 00:06:46.820
 you know, we won't be able to leave 

00:06:45.410 --> 00:06:48.890
 stand will be we will push 

00:06:46.820 --> 00:06:50.840
 motorcycle and we will go because he 

00:06:48.890 --> 00:06:51.620
 poorly done here when the board did 

00:06:50.840 --> 00:06:54.970
 practice is bad 

00:06:51.620 --> 00:06:58.370
 none of the hands fell goats and Muraki 

00:06:54.970 --> 00:07:01.190
 so don't rush start with the simplest 

00:06:58.370 --> 00:07:03.830
 from glands and bearings to nowhere 

00:07:01.190 --> 00:07:05.510
 nothing dripped no flowed 

00:07:03.830 --> 00:07:07.520
 and then you will scold those who 

00:07:05.510 --> 00:07:10.150
 came up with these motorcycles so dare 

00:07:07.520 --> 00:07:10.150
 do not hurry
