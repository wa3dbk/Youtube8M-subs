so<00:02:03.049> we're<00:02:03.200> trying<00:02:03.380> to<00:02:03.530> find<00:02:03.679> ways<00:02:03.890> to<00:02:03.920> work

00:02:04.210 --> 00:02:04.220 
so we're trying to find ways to work

00:02:04.220 --> 00:02:08.180 
so we're trying to find ways to work
around<00:02:04.369> that

00:02:08.180 --> 00:02:08.190 

00:02:08.190 --> 00:02:26.559 

you

00:02:26.559 --> 00:02:26.569 

00:02:26.569 --> 00:02:48.300 

you

00:02:48.300 --> 00:02:48.310 

00:02:48.310 --> 00:02:51.010 

now<00:02:49.310> the<00:02:49.370> iWatch<00:02:49.760> is<00:02:49.910> obviously<00:02:50.240> tubular

00:02:51.010 --> 00:02:51.020 
now the iWatch is obviously tubular

00:02:51.020 --> 00:02:53.199 
now the iWatch is obviously tubular
shape<00:02:51.290> and<00:02:51.620> in<00:02:52.010> order<00:02:52.310> to<00:02:52.489> create<00:02:52.790> that<00:02:53.000> in

00:02:53.199 --> 00:02:53.209 
shape and in order to create that in

00:02:53.209 --> 00:02:55.210 
shape and in order to create that in
after-effects<00:02:53.810> we<00:02:54.470> use<00:02:54.680> the<00:02:54.950> ray<00:02:55.190> tracing

00:02:55.210 --> 00:02:55.220 
after-effects we use the ray tracing

00:02:55.220 --> 00:02:57.490 
after-effects we use the ray tracing
feature<00:02:55.880> found<00:02:56.239> here<00:02:56.540> in<00:02:56.630> After<00:02:56.930> Effects<00:02:57.140> cs6

00:02:57.490 --> 00:02:57.500 
feature found here in After Effects cs6

00:02:57.500 --> 00:03:00.520 
feature found here in After Effects cs6
where<00:02:57.950> we<00:02:58.040> were<00:02:58.160> able<00:02:58.489> to<00:02:58.520> actually<00:02:59.090> bend<00:02:59.840> this

00:03:00.520 --> 00:03:00.530 
where we were able to actually bend this

00:03:00.530 --> 00:03:03.670 
where we were able to actually bend this
composition<00:03:01.430> layer<00:03:02.090> that<00:03:02.330> we<00:03:02.480> had<00:03:02.510> and<00:03:03.020> make

00:03:03.670 --> 00:03:03.680 
composition layer that we had and make

00:03:03.680 --> 00:03:05.860 
composition layer that we had and make
it<00:03:03.800> appear<00:03:04.130> as<00:03:04.160> though<00:03:04.280> it<00:03:04.730> were<00:03:05.000> being

00:03:05.860 --> 00:03:05.870 
it appear as though it were being

00:03:05.870 --> 00:03:13.500 
it appear as though it were being
projected<00:03:06.380> in<00:03:07.010> 3<00:03:07.640> B<00:03:07.850> on<00:03:08.150> to<00:03:08.690> this<00:03:09.020> eyewash<00:03:11.830> and

00:03:25.610 --> 00:03:28.660 
able to take at least two different
planar<00:03:26.000> tracks<00:03:26.390> and<00:03:26.780> gather<00:03:27.470> 3d<00:03:28.040> camera<00:03:28.459> data

00:03:28.660 --> 00:03:28.670 
planar tracks and gather 3d camera data

00:03:28.670 --> 00:03:31.479 
planar tracks and gather 3d camera data
from<00:03:29.120> those<00:03:29.360> tracks<00:03:29.810> here<00:03:30.650> we<00:03:30.830> can<00:03:30.950> see<00:03:31.160> that<00:03:31.190> I

00:03:31.479 --> 00:03:31.489 
from those tracks here we can see that I

00:03:31.489 --> 00:03:34.150 
from those tracks here we can see that I
created<00:03:32.000> two<00:03:32.360> different<00:03:32.720> planar<00:03:33.380> tracks<00:03:33.769> and

00:03:34.150 --> 00:03:34.160 
created two different planar tracks and

00:03:34.160 --> 00:03:37.150 
created two different planar tracks and
I<00:03:34.970> just<00:03:35.209> track<00:03:35.450> them<00:03:35.690> really<00:03:35.930> easily<00:03:36.200> selected

00:03:37.150 --> 00:03:37.160 
I just track them really easily selected

00:03:37.160 --> 00:03:39.400 
I just track them really easily selected
both<00:03:37.310> of<00:03:37.459> them<00:03:37.610> and<00:03:37.880> then<00:03:38.150> went<00:03:38.780> to<00:03:38.930> my<00:03:39.049> camera

00:03:39.400 --> 00:03:39.410 
both of them and then went to my camera

00:03:39.410 --> 00:03:42.190 
both of them and then went to my camera
solve<00:03:39.680> and<00:03:39.920> it<00:03:40.010> gave<00:03:40.160> me<00:03:40.310> in<00:03:40.660> 99<00:03:41.660> percent

00:03:42.190 --> 00:03:42.200 
solve and it gave me in 99 percent

00:03:42.200 --> 00:03:44.890 
solve and it gave me in 99 percent
camera<00:03:42.890> solve<00:03:43.190> accuracy<00:03:44.030> so<00:03:44.569> that's<00:03:44.720> pretty

00:03:44.890 --> 00:03:44.900 
camera solve accuracy so that's pretty

00:03:44.900 --> 00:03:49.390 
camera solve accuracy so that's pretty
cool<00:03:45.110> so<00:03:45.799> that's<00:03:45.890> pretty<00:03:46.190> cool<00:03:46.459> as<00:03:46.970> a<00:03:47.150> note
