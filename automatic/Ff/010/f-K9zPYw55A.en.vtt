00:01:12.469 --> 00:01:12.479 
to safe water for your family we're

00:01:12.479 --> 00:01:13.750 
to safe water for your family we're
going<00:01:12.600> to<00:01:12.659> start<00:01:12.869> with<00:01:13.080> this<00:01:13.170> tee<00:01:13.380> fitting

00:01:13.750 --> 00:01:13.760 
going to start with this tee fitting

00:01:13.760 --> 00:01:16.910 
going to start with this tee fitting
this<00:01:14.760> tee<00:01:14.970> fitting<00:01:15.299> has<00:01:15.450> a<00:01:15.509> valve<00:01:15.840> on<00:01:16.049> it<00:01:16.110> this

00:01:16.910 --> 00:01:16.920 
this tee fitting has a valve on it this

00:01:16.920 --> 00:01:18.530 
this tee fitting has a valve on it this
tee<00:01:17.130> fitting<00:01:17.430> goes<00:01:17.580> on<00:01:17.820> to<00:01:17.970> your<00:01:18.119> existing

00:01:18.530 --> 00:01:18.540 
tee fitting goes on to your existing

tee fitting goes on to your existing
water<00:01:18.750> supply<00:01:19.170> for<00:01:19.380> your<00:01:19.439> sink<00:01:19.740> the<00:01:20.430> water<00:01:20.460> can

00:01:20.899 --> 00:01:20.909 
water supply for your sink the water can

00:01:20.909 --> 00:01:22.280 
water supply for your sink the water can
still<00:01:21.119> flow<00:01:21.330> through<00:01:21.570> you<00:01:21.659> to<00:01:21.900> your<00:01:22.049> sink

00:01:22.280 --> 00:01:22.290 
still flow through you to your sink

00:01:22.290 --> 00:01:24.380 
still flow through you to your sink
through<00:01:22.470> T<00:01:22.680> valve<00:01:22.920> if<00:01:23.430> you<00:01:23.610> have<00:01:23.820> this<00:01:24.030> fitting

00:01:24.380 --> 00:01:24.390 
through T valve if you have this fitting

00:01:24.390 --> 00:01:26.570 
through T valve if you have this fitting
open<00:01:24.689> then<00:01:25.409> it<00:01:25.560> can<00:01:25.680> flow<00:01:25.890> through<00:01:26.159> to<00:01:26.310> your<00:01:26.400> RO

00:01:26.570 --> 00:01:26.580 
open then it can flow through to your RO

00:01:26.580 --> 00:01:29.179 
open then it can flow through to your RO
system<00:01:27.090> as<00:01:27.240> well<00:01:27.390> so<00:01:27.630> the<00:01:28.500> water<00:01:28.680> comes<00:01:28.920> out<00:01:29.130> of

up with a larger stuff that can be done
with<00:02:24.690> cheaper<00:02:25.050> filtration<00:02:25.650> so<00:02:26.370> you<00:02:26.459> use<00:02:26.849> the

00:02:27.020 --> 00:02:27.030 
with cheaper filtration so you use the

00:02:27.030 --> 00:02:29.000 
with cheaper filtration so you use the
lesser<00:02:27.330> expensive<00:02:27.540> filter<00:02:28.020> filtration<00:02:28.739> first

lesser expensive filter filtration first

00:02:29.010 --> 00:02:31.610 
lesser expensive filter filtration first
and<00:02:29.310> then<00:02:30.060> you<00:02:30.239> flow<00:02:30.480> it<00:02:30.629> into<00:02:31.050> the<00:02:31.319> RO

00:02:31.610 --> 00:02:31.620 
and then you flow it into the RO

00:02:31.620 --> 00:02:34.490 
and then you flow it into the RO
membrane<00:02:32.310> so<00:02:33.269> it<00:02:33.390> comes<00:02:33.599> up<00:02:33.810> through<00:02:34.050> here<00:02:34.319> and

00:02:51.800 --> 00:02:51.810 
what the RO membrane looks like if you

00:02:51.810 --> 00:02:53.479 
what the RO membrane looks like if you

00:02:53.479 --> 00:02:53.489 
see it doesn't look porous and that's

00:02:53.489 --> 00:02:55.940 
see it doesn't look porous and that's
because<00:02:53.819> it's<00:02:53.970> on<00:02:54.060> a<00:02:54.090> molecular<00:02:54.420> level<00:02:54.950> the

because it's on a molecular level the

going to talk about the waste water

00:03:13.230 --> 00:03:15.350 
going to talk about the waste water
first<00:03:13.590> you<00:03:14.280> will<00:03:14.370> always<00:03:14.550> have<00:03:14.819> waste<00:03:15.090> water

00:03:15.350 --> 00:03:15.360 
first you will always have waste water

00:03:15.360 --> 00:03:17.149 
first you will always have waste water
in<00:03:15.510> your<00:03:15.629> system<00:03:15.840> the<00:03:16.500> waste<00:03:16.739> water<00:03:16.920> is

00:03:17.149 --> 00:03:17.159 
in your system the waste water is

00:03:17.159 --> 00:03:19.399 
in your system the waste water is

carrying out all the impurities the

00:03:19.409 --> 00:03:21.619 
carrying out all the impurities the
impurities<00:03:19.920> flow<00:03:20.099> down<00:03:20.310> here<00:03:20.640> there's<00:03:21.209> a<00:03:21.360> pipe

00:03:21.619 --> 00:03:21.629 
impurities flow down here there's a pipe

00:03:21.629 --> 00:03:24.290 
impurities flow down here there's a pipe
that<00:03:21.870> goes<00:03:22.099> around<00:03:23.099> the<00:03:23.280> back<00:03:23.459> and<00:03:23.700> then<00:03:24.090> out

00:03:24.290 --> 00:03:24.300 
that goes around the back and then out

00:03:24.300 --> 00:03:27.949 
that goes around the back and then out
into<00:03:24.810> your<00:03:24.959> existing<00:03:25.409> drain<00:03:26.269> we<00:03:27.269> supply<00:03:27.659> a

drainage clamp on your existing draining
your<00:03:31.019> sink<00:03:31.260> you<00:03:31.409> would<00:03:31.530> drill<00:03:31.739> a<00:03:31.769> hole<00:03:31.950> in<00:03:32.159> your

your sink you would drill a hole in your

00:03:32.519 --> 00:03:35.180 
your sink you would drill a hole in your
drain<00:03:32.819> and<00:03:33.140> you<00:03:34.140> put<00:03:34.379> on<00:03:34.500> a<00:03:34.530> drainage<00:03:34.920> clamp

00:03:43.190 --> 00:03:43.200 
water out of your RO system you would

00:03:43.200 --> 00:03:46.610 
water out of your RO system you would
open<00:03:43.530> up<00:03:43.590> this<00:03:43.799> valve<00:03:43.860> here<00:03:44.519> this<00:03:45.480> valve<00:03:45.810> would

00:03:46.610 --> 00:03:46.620 
open up this valve here this valve would

00:03:46.620 --> 00:03:48.500 
open up this valve here this valve would
then<00:03:46.769> allow<00:03:46.920> the<00:03:47.099> water<00:03:47.489> at<00:03:47.760> a<00:03:47.819> greater<00:03:48.330> rate

00:03:48.500 --> 00:03:48.510 
then allow the water at a greater rate

00:03:48.510 --> 00:03:50.390 
then allow the water at a greater rate
to<00:03:48.750> come<00:03:48.930> through<00:03:49.200> out<00:03:49.470> your<00:03:49.739> drain<00:03:49.980> because

00:03:50.390 --> 00:03:50.400 
to come through out your drain because

00:03:50.400 --> 00:03:52.250 
to come through out your drain because
there<00:03:50.549> is<00:03:50.640> no<00:03:50.790> pressure<00:03:51.090> in<00:03:51.299> your<00:03:51.450> system<00:03:51.810> by

00:03:52.250 --> 00:03:52.260 
there is no pressure in your system by

00:03:52.260 --> 00:03:53.839 
there is no pressure in your system by
closing<00:03:52.560> the<00:03:52.799> valve<00:03:52.980> you<00:03:53.159> create<00:03:53.430> pressure<00:03:53.670> in

00:03:53.839 --> 00:03:53.849 
closing the valve you create pressure in

00:03:53.849 --> 00:03:55.759 
closing the valve you create pressure in
your<00:03:53.879> system<00:03:54.360> and<00:03:54.569> the<00:03:54.780> RO<00:03:54.959> system<00:03:55.530> works

00:03:55.759 --> 00:03:55.769 
your system and the RO system works

00:03:55.769 --> 00:03:59.420 
your system and the RO system works
appropriately<00:03:57.319> so<00:03:58.319> now<00:03:58.709> you<00:03:58.769> have<00:03:59.069> your<00:03:59.099> clean
