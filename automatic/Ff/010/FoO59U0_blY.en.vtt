00:00:04.400 --> 00:00:04.410 
okay so we have this huge pile of spices

00:00:04.410 --> 00:00:07.369 
okay so we have this huge pile of spices
in<00:00:04.710> a<00:00:05.299> little<00:00:06.299> cupboard<00:00:06.540> staking<00:00:07.170> out<00:00:07.230> those

00:00:07.369 --> 00:00:07.379 
in a little cupboard staking out those

00:00:07.379 --> 00:00:14.270 
in a little cupboard staking out those
of<00:00:07.500> space<00:00:07.710> and<00:00:08.690> I<00:00:10.040> would<00:00:11.040> like<00:00:11.580> to<00:00:13.099> get<00:00:14.099> them<00:00:14.219> on

00:00:14.270 --> 00:00:14.280 
of space and I would like to get them on

00:00:14.280 --> 00:00:18.590 
of space and I would like to get them on
my<00:00:14.370> wall<00:00:14.549> there<00:00:14.880> maybe<00:00:15.920> and<00:00:16.920> get<00:00:17.600> that

00:00:18.590 --> 00:00:18.600 
my wall there maybe and get that

00:00:18.600 --> 00:00:24.130 
my wall there maybe and get that
cupboard<00:00:18.869> back<00:00:20.150> we<00:00:21.150> also<00:00:21.270> have<00:00:22.490> this<00:00:23.490> blind

00:00:24.130 --> 00:00:24.140 
cupboard back we also have this blind

00:00:24.140 --> 00:00:28.429 
cupboard back we also have this blind
that<00:00:25.140> came<00:00:25.560> down<00:00:26.449> it's<00:00:27.449> a<00:00:27.480> bit<00:00:27.630> destroyed<00:00:28.140> and

00:00:28.429 --> 00:00:28.439 
that came down it's a bit destroyed and

00:00:28.439 --> 00:00:32.889 
that came down it's a bit destroyed and
I<00:00:28.560> was<00:00:28.650> thinking<00:00:28.920> maybe<00:00:29.720> these<00:00:30.720> little<00:00:31.250> slots

00:00:32.889 --> 00:00:32.899 
I was thinking maybe these little slots

00:00:32.899 --> 00:00:38.690 
I was thinking maybe these little slots
might<00:00:33.899> make<00:00:34.170> a<00:00:35.600> reasonable<00:00:36.600> front<00:00:37.140> for<00:00:37.770> a<00:00:38.100> set

00:00:38.690 --> 00:00:38.700 
might make a reasonable front for a set

00:00:38.700 --> 00:00:45.740 
might make a reasonable front for a set
of<00:00:38.790> shelves<00:00:40.969> but<00:00:41.969> one<00:00:42.210> hand<00:00:42.920> slide<00:00:43.920> up<00:00:44.100> him<00:00:44.750> so

00:00:45.740 --> 00:00:45.750 
of shelves but one hand slide up him so

00:00:45.750 --> 00:00:51.760 
of shelves but one hand slide up him so
I<00:00:47.690> can<00:00:48.690> either<00:00:48.809> go<00:00:49.020> to<00:00:49.050> that<00:00:50.030> tear<00:00:51.030> works<00:00:51.270> out

00:00:51.760 --> 00:00:51.770 
I can either go to that tear works out

00:00:51.770 --> 00:00:55.970 
I can either go to that tear works out
before<00:00:52.770> I<00:00:52.800> run<00:00:53.039> out<00:00:53.070> and<00:00:53.660> bought<00:00:54.660> a<00:00:55.020> new<00:00:55.140> wood<00:00:55.590> I

00:00:55.970 --> 00:00:55.980 
before I run out and bought a new wood I

00:00:55.980 --> 00:00:59.540 
before I run out and bought a new wood I
thought<00:00:56.760> it<00:00:56.850> might<00:00:56.969> be<00:00:57.059> a<00:00:57.090> good<00:00:57.210> idea<00:00:57.329> to<00:00:58.550> see

00:00:59.540 --> 00:00:59.550 
thought it might be a good idea to see

00:00:59.550 --> 00:01:01.459 
thought it might be a good idea to see
much<00:00:59.699> space<00:01:00.210> these<00:01:00.629> are<00:01:00.780> going<00:01:00.899> to<00:01:00.989> take<00:01:01.170> up<00:01:01.320> on

00:01:01.459 --> 00:01:01.469 
much space these are going to take up on

00:01:01.469 --> 00:01:05.539 
much space these are going to take up on
the<00:01:01.559> wall<00:01:01.800> and<00:01:03.949> looking<00:01:04.949> at<00:01:05.129> this<00:01:05.250> I'm

00:01:05.539 --> 00:01:05.549 
the wall and looking at this I'm

00:01:05.549 --> 00:01:08.450 
the wall and looking at this I'm
wondering<00:01:05.729> if<00:01:06.090> maybe<00:01:06.920> it<00:01:07.920> might<00:01:08.130> be<00:01:08.280> a<00:01:08.310> little

00:01:08.450 --> 00:01:08.460 
wondering if maybe it might be a little

00:01:08.460 --> 00:01:18.429 
wondering if maybe it might be a little
easier<00:01:08.850> to<00:01:10.850> build<00:01:11.850> one<00:01:13.850> not<00:01:14.850> so<00:01:15.119> wide<00:01:15.830> unit

00:01:18.429 --> 00:01:18.439 
easier to build one not so wide unit

00:01:18.439 --> 00:01:22.179 
easier to build one not so wide unit
maybe<00:01:19.439> we<00:01:19.530> could<00:01:19.680> take<00:01:19.830> with<00:01:20.009> us<00:01:20.189> if<00:01:20.310> we<00:01:20.430> moved

00:01:22.179 --> 00:01:22.189 
maybe we could take with us if we moved

00:01:22.189 --> 00:01:25.910 
maybe we could take with us if we moved
rather<00:01:23.189> than<00:01:23.400> one<00:01:23.610> really<00:01:24.030> why<00:01:24.210> one<00:01:24.740> and<00:01:25.740> maybe

00:01:25.910 --> 00:01:25.920 
rather than one really why one and maybe

00:01:25.920 --> 00:01:30.200 
rather than one really why one and maybe
if<00:01:26.100> it's<00:01:26.250> a<00:01:26.340> bit<00:01:26.490> narrower<00:01:27.000> I<00:01:28.970> won't<00:01:29.970> need<00:01:30.060> to

00:01:30.200 --> 00:01:30.210 
if it's a bit narrower I won't need to

00:01:30.210 --> 00:01:34.100 
if it's a bit narrower I won't need to
support<00:01:31.369> the<00:01:32.369> slats<00:01:32.820> from<00:01:33.119> the<00:01:33.210> blind<00:01:33.630> and<00:01:33.990> the

00:01:34.100 --> 00:01:34.110 
support the slats from the blind and the

00:01:34.110 --> 00:01:36.800 
support the slats from the blind and the
middle<00:01:34.409> either

00:01:36.800 --> 00:01:36.810 

00:01:36.810 --> 00:01:42.440 

I<00:01:37.880> make<00:01:38.880> it<00:01:39.030> quite<00:01:39.270> tall<00:01:41.090> you<00:01:42.090> know<00:01:42.119> I<00:01:42.180> can<00:01:42.329> live

00:01:42.440 --> 00:01:42.450 
I make it quite tall you know I can live

00:01:42.450 --> 00:01:44.710 
I make it quite tall you know I can live
with<00:01:42.600> that

00:01:44.710 --> 00:01:44.720 
with that

00:01:44.720 --> 00:01:48.260 
with that
anyway<00:01:45.720> it's<00:01:46.560> coming<00:01:46.860> boy<00:01:46.979> I<00:01:47.369> think<00:01:48.119> these

00:01:48.260 --> 00:01:48.270 
anyway it's coming boy I think these

00:01:48.270 --> 00:01:52.550 
anyway it's coming boy I think these
ones<00:01:48.450> around<00:01:48.840> the<00:01:49.280> largest<00:01:51.140> size<00:01:52.140> I'm<00:01:52.380> gonna

00:01:52.550 --> 00:01:52.560 
ones around the largest size I'm gonna

00:01:52.560 --> 00:01:54.080 
ones around the largest size I'm gonna
want<00:01:52.710> to<00:01:52.799> stick<00:01:53.070> on<00:01:53.189> this<00:01:53.310> shelf

00:01:54.080 --> 00:01:54.090 
want to stick on this shelf

00:01:54.090 --> 00:01:55.820 
want to stick on this shelf
I<00:01:54.119> think<00:01:55.020> I'm<00:01:55.110> going<00:01:55.229> to<00:01:55.289> take<00:01:55.470> one<00:01:55.649> of<00:01:55.679> these

00:01:55.820 --> 00:01:55.830 
I think I'm going to take one of these

00:01:55.830 --> 00:01:58.609 
I think I'm going to take one of these
with<00:01:56.100> me<00:01:56.280> and<00:01:56.720> see<00:01:57.720> if<00:01:57.810> I<00:01:57.899> can<00:01:58.049> find<00:01:58.259> a<00:01:58.380> bit<00:01:58.500> of

00:01:58.609 --> 00:01:58.619 
with me and see if I can find a bit of

00:01:58.619 --> 00:02:01.219 
with me and see if I can find a bit of
wood<00:01:58.770> that<00:01:58.830> sort<00:01:59.280> of<00:01:59.630> matches<00:02:00.630> the<00:02:00.750> right<00:02:00.929> size

00:02:01.219 --> 00:02:01.229 
wood that sort of matches the right size

00:02:01.229 --> 00:02:07.160 
wood that sort of matches the right size
so<00:02:02.570> I<00:02:03.570> put<00:02:04.049> to<00:02:04.140> the<00:02:04.229> shops<00:02:04.470> and<00:02:04.799> got<00:02:05.220> these<00:02:06.170> pine

00:02:07.160 --> 00:02:07.170 
so I put to the shops and got these pine

00:02:07.170 --> 00:02:11.029 
so I put to the shops and got these pine
planks<00:02:08.690> there<00:02:09.690> at<00:02:10.170> two<00:02:10.289> and<00:02:10.410> half<00:02:10.530> meters<00:02:10.799> long

00:02:11.029 --> 00:02:11.039 
planks there at two and half meters long

00:02:11.039 --> 00:02:14.270 
planks there at two and half meters long
about<00:02:11.489> three<00:02:11.880> inches<00:02:12.840> wide<00:02:13.100> they're<00:02:14.100> just

00:02:14.270 --> 00:02:14.280 
about three inches wide they're just

00:02:14.280 --> 00:02:17.420 
about three inches wide they're just
about<00:02:14.370> the<00:02:14.519> right<00:02:14.670> size<00:02:15.060> to<00:02:15.750> fit<00:02:15.780> a<00:02:16.319> spy<00:02:17.100> spot

00:02:17.420 --> 00:02:17.430 
about the right size to fit a spy spot

00:02:17.430 --> 00:02:20.390 
about the right size to fit a spy spot
on<00:02:17.610> and<00:02:18.110> leave<00:02:19.110> a<00:02:19.140> little<00:02:19.319> bit<00:02:19.560> of<00:02:19.680> space<00:02:19.920> for

00:02:20.390 --> 00:02:20.400 
on and leave a little bit of space for

00:02:20.400 --> 00:02:23.990 
on and leave a little bit of space for
the<00:02:20.700> blind<00:02:21.120> slat<00:02:21.980> to<00:02:22.980> hold<00:02:23.310> the<00:02:23.430> spy<00:02:23.610> spots<00:02:23.880> on

the blind slat to hold the spy spots on
the<00:02:24.090> road<00:02:24.269> I<00:02:24.709> really<00:02:25.709> just<00:02:25.860> eyeballed<00:02:26.660> picking

00:02:27.650 --> 00:02:27.660 
the road I really just eyeballed picking

00:02:27.660 --> 00:02:29.300 
the road I really just eyeballed picking
these<00:02:27.810> particular<00:02:28.049> planks

00:02:29.300 --> 00:02:29.310 
these particular planks

00:02:29.310 --> 00:02:31.430 
these particular planks
they<00:02:29.670> seemed<00:02:29.880> about<00:02:30.030> the<00:02:30.120> right<00:02:30.269> size<00:02:30.510> and<00:02:30.540> I

00:02:31.430 --> 00:02:31.440 
they seemed about the right size and I

00:02:31.440 --> 00:02:33.400 
they seemed about the right size and I
reckoned<00:02:31.890> in<00:02:31.980> the<00:02:32.040> shop<00:02:32.280> I<00:02:32.489> could<00:02:32.670> get<00:02:32.880> about

00:02:33.400 --> 00:02:33.410 
reckoned in the shop I could get about

00:02:33.410 --> 00:02:38.380 
reckoned in the shop I could get about
five<00:02:34.410> or<00:02:34.739> six<00:02:35.130> shelves<00:02:36.140> out<00:02:37.140> of<00:02:37.319> one<00:02:37.530> piece

00:02:38.380 --> 00:02:38.390 
five or six shelves out of one piece

00:02:38.390 --> 00:02:41.210 
five or six shelves out of one piece
here's<00:02:39.390> the<00:02:39.510> two<00:02:39.690> sides<00:02:39.989> ended<00:02:40.530> up<00:02:40.620> with<00:02:40.769> after

00:02:41.210 --> 00:02:41.220 
here's the two sides ended up with after

00:02:41.220 --> 00:02:43.569 
here's the two sides ended up with after
cutting<00:02:41.489> a<00:02:41.579> plank<00:02:41.820> more<00:02:42.269> or<00:02:42.329> less<00:02:42.450> in<00:02:42.600> half

00:02:43.569 --> 00:02:43.579 
cutting a plank more or less in half

00:02:43.579 --> 00:02:51.860 
cutting a plank more or less in half
I've<00:02:44.630> left<00:02:47.030> 18<00:02:48.030> centimeters<00:02:49.130> per<00:02:50.130> gap<00:02:50.870> for

00:02:51.860 --> 00:02:51.870 
I've left 18 centimeters per gap for

00:02:51.870 --> 00:02:55.610 
I've left 18 centimeters per gap for
spices<00:02:52.319> and<00:02:53.030> these<00:02:54.030> boards<00:02:54.420> around<00:02:54.720> 19<00:02:55.230> mil

spices and these boards around 19 mil
thick<00:02:56.220> and<00:02:57.060> here<00:02:57.690> I've<00:02:57.810> marked<00:02:58.079> out<00:02:58.290> around

00:02:59.319 --> 00:02:59.329 
thick and here I've marked out around

thick and here I've marked out around
cut<00:03:00.329> out<00:03:00.680> sections<00:03:01.680> to<00:03:02.040> fit<00:03:02.220> the<00:03:02.280> board's<00:03:02.609> in<00:03:02.790> I

00:03:03.670 --> 00:03:03.680 
cut out sections to fit the board's in I

00:03:03.680 --> 00:03:08.509 
cut out sections to fit the board's in I
did<00:03:04.680> these<00:03:04.890> cuts<00:03:05.280> with<00:03:05.519> a<00:03:05.549> tenon<00:03:05.940> saw<00:03:06.859> it's<00:03:07.859> a

00:03:08.509 --> 00:03:08.519 
did these cuts with a tenon saw it's a

00:03:08.519 --> 00:03:10.220 
did these cuts with a tenon saw it's a
little<00:03:08.760> bit<00:03:08.850> tricky<00:03:09.209> but<00:03:09.420> you<00:03:09.600> do<00:03:09.750> eventually

00:03:10.220 --> 00:03:10.230 
little bit tricky but you do eventually

00:03:10.230 --> 00:03:13.849 
little bit tricky but you do eventually
get<00:03:10.410> there<00:03:10.639> actually<00:03:12.590> considerably<00:03:13.590> harder

00:03:13.849 --> 00:03:13.859 
get there actually considerably harder

00:03:13.859 --> 00:03:16.009 
get there actually considerably harder
than<00:03:14.340> I<00:03:14.430> imagined<00:03:14.760> it<00:03:14.850> would<00:03:14.970> be<00:03:15.030> with<00:03:15.989> a

00:03:16.009 --> 00:03:16.019 
than I imagined it would be with a

00:03:16.019 --> 00:03:20.680 
than I imagined it would be with a
proper<00:03:16.380> table<00:03:16.769> saw<00:03:17.010> and<00:03:17.579> a<00:03:18.060> dado<00:03:18.329> cutter<00:03:19.609> but

00:03:20.680 --> 00:03:20.690 
proper table saw and a dado cutter but

00:03:20.690 --> 00:03:23.840 
proper table saw and a dado cutter but
I've<00:03:21.690> only<00:03:21.750> got<00:03:21.870> manual<00:03:22.230> tools<00:03:22.440> so<00:03:22.829> after<00:03:23.760> may

00:03:23.840 --> 00:03:23.850 
I've only got manual tools so after may

00:03:23.850 --> 00:03:26.930 
I've only got manual tools so after may
do<00:03:23.910> the<00:03:24.120> word<00:03:24.269> god<00:03:24.470> okay<00:03:25.470> just<00:03:25.709> a<00:03:25.769> quick<00:03:26.069> taking

out<00:03:27.060> these<00:03:27.269> calls<00:03:28.049> with<00:03:29.010> this<00:03:29.280> chisel<00:03:29.760> and

00:03:31.090 --> 00:03:31.100 
out these calls with this chisel and

00:03:31.100 --> 00:03:36.650 
out these calls with this chisel and
unfortunately<00:03:32.150> this<00:03:33.150> is<00:03:33.420> very<00:03:34.519> slightly<00:03:35.660> too

00:03:36.650 --> 00:03:36.660 
unfortunately this is very slightly too

00:03:36.660 --> 00:03:42.199 
unfortunately this is very slightly too
big<00:03:37.609> and<00:03:39.500> I<00:03:40.500> don't<00:03:41.010> want<00:03:41.190> to<00:03:41.250> risk<00:03:41.430> splitting

00:03:42.199 --> 00:03:42.209 
big and I don't want to risk splitting

00:03:42.209 --> 00:03:44.750 
big and I don't want to risk splitting
the<00:03:42.510> wood<00:03:42.920> down<00:03:43.920> this<00:03:44.069> way<00:03:44.310> I'm<00:03:44.459> necessarily

00:03:44.750 --> 00:03:44.760 
the wood down this way I'm necessarily

00:03:44.760 --> 00:03:49.160 
the wood down this way I'm necessarily
so<00:03:45.830> goddamn<00:03:46.830> fine<00:03:47.010> you<00:03:47.159> chisel<00:03:47.930> okay<00:03:48.930> better

00:03:49.160 --> 00:03:49.170 
so goddamn fine you chisel okay better

so goddamn fine you chisel okay better
the<00:03:49.290> new<00:03:49.409> chisel<00:03:49.909> this<00:03:51.680> moobs<00:03:52.680> mother<00:03:53.069> bear's

the new chisel this moobs mother bear's

00:03:53.370 --> 00:03:55.970 
the new chisel this moobs mother bear's
voice<00:03:54.170> so<00:03:55.170> you<00:03:55.230> can<00:03:55.260> clean<00:03:55.620> this<00:03:55.739> on<00:03:55.890> the

00:03:55.970 --> 00:03:55.980 
voice so you can clean this on the

voice so you can clean this on the
burner<00:03:56.360> this<00:03:57.360> is<00:03:57.510> my<00:03:57.689> first<00:03:58.409> go<00:03:58.650> at<00:03:58.799> cutting

00:03:59.030 --> 00:03:59.040 
burner this is my first go at cutting

00:03:59.040 --> 00:04:02.089 
burner this is my first go at cutting
out<00:03:59.250> one<00:03:59.400> of<00:03:59.489> these<00:03:59.610> joints<00:03:59.879> with<00:04:00.750> a<00:04:00.780> chisel<00:04:01.099> a

00:04:02.089 --> 00:04:02.099 
out one of these joints with a chisel a

00:04:02.099 --> 00:04:05.119 
out one of these joints with a chisel a
really<00:04:02.640> no<00:04:03.120> idea<00:04:03.269> other<00:04:04.260> than<00:04:04.439> the<00:04:04.620> marks<00:04:04.950> are

00:04:05.119 --> 00:04:05.129 
really no idea other than the marks are

00:04:05.129 --> 00:04:06.979 
really no idea other than the marks are
made<00:04:05.159> on<00:04:05.459> either<00:04:05.489> end<00:04:05.849> how<00:04:06.030> deep<00:04:06.360> to<00:04:06.390> take<00:04:06.780> them

00:04:06.979 --> 00:04:06.989 
made on either end how deep to take them

00:04:06.989 --> 00:04:09.530 
made on either end how deep to take them
it's<00:04:07.200> difficult<00:04:07.290> to<00:04:07.890> know<00:04:08.129> if<00:04:08.790> you're<00:04:09.180> taking

00:04:09.530 --> 00:04:09.540 
it's difficult to know if you're taking

00:04:09.540 --> 00:04:12.350 
it's difficult to know if you're taking
out<00:04:09.629> too<00:04:09.810> much<00:04:09.930> wood<00:04:10.200> is<00:04:10.349> going<00:04:10.560> along<00:04:11.360> again

00:04:12.350 --> 00:04:12.360 
out too much wood is going along again

00:04:12.360 --> 00:04:14.630 
out too much wood is going along again
as<00:04:12.930> with<00:04:13.140> much<00:04:13.290> this<00:04:13.530> project<00:04:13.950> I<00:04:14.099> just<00:04:14.489> sort<00:04:14.610> of

00:04:14.630 --> 00:04:14.640 
as with much this project I just sort of

00:04:14.640 --> 00:04:18.050 
as with much this project I just sort of
eyeball<00:04:14.819> derp<00:04:15.320> and<00:04:16.320> this<00:04:17.310> one<00:04:17.519> turn<00:04:17.700> alright

00:04:18.050 --> 00:04:18.060 
eyeball derp and this one turn alright

00:04:18.060 --> 00:04:20.839 
eyeball derp and this one turn alright
um<00:04:18.409> some<00:04:19.409> of<00:04:19.530> them<00:04:19.680> were<00:04:19.979> a<00:04:20.010> little<00:04:20.220> bit<00:04:20.459> harder

00:04:20.839 --> 00:04:20.849 
um some of them were a little bit harder

00:04:20.849 --> 00:04:22.610 
um some of them were a little bit harder
this<00:04:21.299> one<00:04:21.479> with<00:04:21.599> a<00:04:21.630> lot<00:04:21.870> I<00:04:22.019> just<00:04:22.200> had<00:04:22.349> to<00:04:22.470> keep

00:04:22.610 --> 00:04:22.620 
this one with a lot I just had to keep

00:04:22.620 --> 00:04:25.909 
this one with a lot I just had to keep
hitting<00:04:23.039> at<00:04:23.220> until<00:04:23.940> eventually<00:04:24.120> through<00:04:24.930> with

00:04:25.909 --> 00:04:25.919 
hitting at until eventually through with

00:04:25.919 --> 00:04:27.350 
hitting at until eventually through with
majority<00:04:26.220> of<00:04:26.400> them<00:04:26.550> just<00:04:26.729> popped<00:04:26.880> out<00:04:27.090> pretty

00:04:27.350 --> 00:04:27.360 
majority of them just popped out pretty

00:04:27.360 --> 00:04:31.490 
majority of them just popped out pretty
cleanly<00:04:28.700> so<00:04:29.700> this<00:04:30.180> is<00:04:30.300> a<00:04:30.330> proper<00:04:30.690> milestone<00:04:31.289> in

00:04:31.490 --> 00:04:31.500 
cleanly so this is a proper milestone in

00:04:31.500 --> 00:04:34.610 
cleanly so this is a proper milestone in
the<00:04:31.560> project<00:04:31.640> I've<00:04:33.110> cut<00:04:34.110> all<00:04:34.260> these<00:04:34.380> joints

00:04:34.610 --> 00:04:34.620 
the project I've cut all these joints

00:04:34.620 --> 00:04:36.409 
the project I've cut all these joints
out<00:04:34.919> and<00:04:35.010> this<00:04:35.099> is<00:04:35.190> my<00:04:35.310> first<00:04:35.700> fit<00:04:36.120> of<00:04:36.300> the

00:04:36.409 --> 00:04:36.419 
out and this is my first fit of the

00:04:36.419 --> 00:04:38.779 
out and this is my first fit of the
shelves<00:04:36.990> just<00:04:37.140> to<00:04:38.099> test<00:04:38.370> how<00:04:38.520> it<00:04:38.550> comes

00:04:38.779 --> 00:04:38.789 
shelves just to test how it comes

00:04:38.789 --> 00:04:41.839 
shelves just to test how it comes
together<00:04:38.940> and<00:04:39.860> really<00:04:40.860> they<00:04:41.400> were<00:04:41.460> right

00:04:41.839 --> 00:04:41.849 
together and really they were right

00:04:41.849 --> 00:04:44.980 
together and really they were right
which<00:04:42.690> i<00:04:42.840> think<00:04:42.900> is<00:04:43.229> more<00:04:43.650> luck<00:04:44.159> than<00:04:44.190> skill

00:04:44.980 --> 00:04:44.990 
which i think is more luck than skill

00:04:44.990 --> 00:04:50.409 
which i think is more luck than skill
and<00:04:45.990> now<00:04:46.349> I'm<00:04:47.390> gonna<00:04:48.390> have<00:04:48.570> a<00:04:48.599> look<00:04:48.900> and<00:04:49.140> see

00:04:50.409 --> 00:04:50.419 
and now I'm gonna have a look and see

00:04:50.419 --> 00:04:54.800 
and now I'm gonna have a look and see
the<00:04:51.419> best<00:04:51.659> way<00:04:51.810> to<00:04:51.840> fit<00:04:52.289> the<00:04:52.820> blind<00:04:53.820> slat<00:04:54.240> into

00:04:54.800 --> 00:04:54.810 
the best way to fit the blind slat into

00:04:54.810 --> 00:04:56.120 
the best way to fit the blind slat into
these<00:04:54.930> little<00:04:55.110> shells<00:04:55.380> we've<00:04:55.710> made<00:04:55.919> at<00:04:56.039> the

00:04:56.120 --> 00:04:56.130 
these little shells we've made at the

00:04:56.130 --> 00:04:58.670 
these little shells we've made at the
front<00:04:56.370> I<00:04:56.840> decided<00:04:57.840> the<00:04:57.930> best<00:04:57.960> way<00:04:58.229> to<00:04:58.260> do<00:04:58.500> this

00:04:58.670 --> 00:04:58.680 
front I decided the best way to do this

00:04:58.680 --> 00:05:04.360 
front I decided the best way to do this
would<00:04:58.890> be<00:04:58.950> to<00:05:00.020> drill<00:05:01.020> out<00:05:01.229> a<00:05:02.599> section<00:05:03.599> and

00:05:04.360 --> 00:05:04.370 
would be to drill out a section and

00:05:04.370 --> 00:05:07.070 
would be to drill out a section and
chisel<00:05:05.370> out<00:05:05.430> the<00:05:05.520> gap<00:05:05.700> between<00:05:05.820> them<00:05:06.240> and<00:05:06.390> then

00:05:07.070 --> 00:05:07.080 
chisel out the gap between them and then

00:05:07.080 --> 00:05:10.339 
chisel out the gap between them and then
try<00:05:07.650> and<00:05:07.800> slow<00:05:08.219> made<00:05:08.430> the<00:05:08.580> slats<00:05:09.229> between<00:05:10.229> the

00:05:10.339 --> 00:05:10.349 
try and slow made the slats between the

00:05:10.349 --> 00:05:11.600 
try and slow made the slats between the
two<00:05:10.500> shelves<00:05:10.800> so<00:05:11.130> that<00:05:11.280> they<00:05:11.400> were

00:05:11.600 --> 00:05:11.610 
two shelves so that they were

00:05:11.610 --> 00:05:13.459 
two shelves so that they were
recessed<00:05:12.390> very<00:05:12.659> slightly<00:05:12.930> from<00:05:13.110> the<00:05:13.200> front

00:05:13.459 --> 00:05:13.469 
recessed very slightly from the front

00:05:13.469 --> 00:05:16.279 
recessed very slightly from the front
there's<00:05:14.460> actually<00:05:14.820> a<00:05:15.120> fair<00:05:15.750> bit<00:05:15.780> trickier

00:05:16.279 --> 00:05:16.289 
there's actually a fair bit trickier

00:05:16.289 --> 00:05:19.100 
there's actually a fair bit trickier
than<00:05:16.320> I<00:05:16.500> expected<00:05:16.890> it<00:05:17.039> to<00:05:17.070> be<00:05:17.450> and<00:05:18.450> I<00:05:18.510> made

00:05:19.100 --> 00:05:19.110 
than I expected it to be and I made

00:05:19.110 --> 00:05:22.390 
than I expected it to be and I made
quite<00:05:19.289> a<00:05:19.409> mess<00:05:19.469> some<00:05:20.190> of<00:05:20.280> these<00:05:20.370> holes<00:05:20.640> and

00:05:22.390 --> 00:05:22.400 
quite a mess some of these holes and

00:05:22.400 --> 00:05:24.790 
quite a mess some of these holes and
actually<00:05:23.400> halfway<00:05:23.729> through<00:05:23.880> the<00:05:23.969> project<00:05:24.150> I

00:05:24.790 --> 00:05:24.800 
actually halfway through the project I

00:05:24.800 --> 00:05:28.420 
actually halfway through the project I
realised<00:05:25.800> that<00:05:26.039> I'd<00:05:26.159> done<00:05:26.390> half<00:05:27.390> of<00:05:27.659> the<00:05:27.780> side

00:05:28.420 --> 00:05:28.430 
realised that I'd done half of the side

00:05:28.430 --> 00:05:31.370 
realised that I'd done half of the side
the<00:05:29.430> wrong<00:05:29.640> way<00:05:29.760> around<00:05:29.820> so<00:05:30.539> had<00:05:31.020> to<00:05:31.050> go<00:05:31.229> back

00:05:31.370 --> 00:05:31.380 
the wrong way around so had to go back

00:05:31.380 --> 00:05:35.270 
the wrong way around so had to go back
and<00:05:31.610> redo<00:05:32.610> all<00:05:32.640> those<00:05:33.270> old<00:05:33.479> again<00:05:34.039> but<00:05:35.039> after

00:05:35.270 --> 00:05:35.280 
and redo all those old again but after

00:05:35.280 --> 00:05:36.980 
and redo all those old again but after
correcting<00:05:35.490> that<00:05:35.729> mistake<00:05:36.120> it<00:05:36.330> was<00:05:36.479> a<00:05:36.510> quick

00:05:36.980 --> 00:05:36.990 
correcting that mistake it was a quick

00:05:36.990 --> 00:05:39.980 
correcting that mistake it was a quick
job<00:05:37.320> to<00:05:37.620> chop<00:05:38.610> the<00:05:38.700> slats<00:05:38.940> down<00:05:39.030> to<00:05:39.300> size<00:05:39.570> and

00:05:39.980 --> 00:05:39.990 
job to chop the slats down to size and

00:05:39.990 --> 00:05:43.580 
job to chop the slats down to size and
then<00:05:40.890> test<00:05:41.400> fit<00:05:41.610> them<00:05:41.729> into<00:05:41.909> the<00:05:42.360> whole<00:05:42.659> unit

00:05:43.580 --> 00:05:43.590 
then test fit them into the whole unit

00:05:43.590 --> 00:05:46.250 
then test fit them into the whole unit
and<00:05:43.680> lo<00:05:44.640> and<00:05:44.760> behold<00:05:44.850> actually<00:05:45.810> works<00:05:45.960> but<00:05:46.110> all

00:05:46.250 --> 00:05:46.260 
and lo and behold actually works but all

00:05:46.260 --> 00:05:49.400 
and lo and behold actually works but all
right<00:05:47.570> it<00:05:48.570> was<00:05:48.690> at<00:05:48.780> this<00:05:48.900> point<00:05:48.990> that<00:05:49.230> I

00:05:49.400 --> 00:05:49.410 
right it was at this point that I

00:05:49.410 --> 00:05:50.540 
right it was at this point that I
actually<00:05:49.590> started<00:05:50.010> thinking<00:05:50.070> about<00:05:50.400> how<00:05:50.520> I

00:05:50.540 --> 00:05:50.550 
actually started thinking about how I

00:05:50.550 --> 00:05:51.980 
actually started thinking about how I
was<00:05:50.670> going<00:05:50.880> to<00:05:50.970> put<00:05:51.090> this<00:05:51.240> unit<00:05:51.570> on<00:05:51.690> the<00:05:51.810> wall

00:05:51.980 --> 00:05:51.990 
was going to put this unit on the wall

00:05:51.990 --> 00:05:56.540 
was going to put this unit on the wall
and<00:05:52.400> it<00:05:53.400> occurred<00:05:53.760> to<00:05:53.790> me<00:05:54.030> that<00:05:55.520> given<00:05:56.520> that

00:05:56.540 --> 00:05:56.550 
and it occurred to me that given that

00:05:56.550 --> 00:05:57.830 
and it occurred to me that given that
some<00:05:56.760> of<00:05:56.820> these<00:05:56.910> spices<00:05:57.150> are<00:05:57.330> quite<00:05:57.570> strongly

00:05:57.830 --> 00:05:57.840 
some of these spices are quite strongly

00:05:57.840 --> 00:05:59.720 
some of these spices are quite strongly
colored<00:05:58.170> I<00:05:58.590> didn't<00:05:58.800> want<00:05:58.920> to<00:05:59.010> stain<00:05:59.340> the<00:05:59.550> white

00:05:59.720 --> 00:05:59.730 
colored I didn't want to stain the white

00:05:59.730 --> 00:06:01.910 
colored I didn't want to stain the white
wall<00:06:00.000> and<00:06:00.330> I<00:06:00.810> should<00:06:01.110> probably<00:06:01.200> find<00:06:01.470> a<00:06:01.710> back

00:06:01.910 --> 00:06:01.920 
wall and I should probably find a back

00:06:01.920 --> 00:06:04.700 
wall and I should probably find a back
for<00:06:02.190> this<00:06:02.340> so<00:06:02.880> I<00:06:03.270> popped<00:06:04.110> back<00:06:04.290> to<00:06:04.470> the<00:06:04.560> shop

00:06:04.700 --> 00:06:04.710 
for this so I popped back to the shop

00:06:04.710 --> 00:06:08.780 
for this so I popped back to the shop
again<00:06:05.130> and<00:06:06.680> got<00:06:07.680> some<00:06:07.920> fiberboard<00:06:08.550> for<00:06:08.730> the

00:06:08.780 --> 00:06:08.790 
again and got some fiberboard for the

00:06:08.790 --> 00:06:14.090 
again and got some fiberboard for the
back<00:06:08.970> and<00:06:09.860> some<00:06:10.860> brass<00:06:12.260> fixings<00:06:13.260> to<00:06:13.500> hang<00:06:14.010> it

00:06:14.090 --> 00:06:14.100 
back and some brass fixings to hang it

00:06:14.100 --> 00:06:16.520 
back and some brass fixings to hang it
from<00:06:14.480> okay<00:06:15.480> then

00:06:16.520 --> 00:06:16.530 
from okay then

00:06:16.530 --> 00:06:20.360 
from okay then
there<00:06:16.890> is<00:06:18.080> made<00:06:19.080> quite<00:06:19.290> a<00:06:19.350> lot<00:06:19.920> of<00:06:20.070> mistakes

00:06:20.360 --> 00:06:20.370 
there is made quite a lot of mistakes

00:06:20.370 --> 00:06:24.440 
there is made quite a lot of mistakes
making<00:06:20.850> this<00:06:21.320> there's<00:06:22.320> a<00:06:23.000> few<00:06:24.000> additional

00:06:24.440 --> 00:06:24.450 
making this there's a few additional

00:06:24.450 --> 00:06:29.570 
making this there's a few additional
holes<00:06:24.720> to<00:06:25.260> let<00:06:25.380> alone<00:06:25.800> form<00:06:26.220> and<00:06:28.430> zippy<00:06:29.430> more

00:06:29.570 --> 00:06:29.580 
holes to let alone form and zippy more

00:06:29.580 --> 00:06:33.140 
holes to let alone form and zippy more
marks<00:06:29.940> and<00:06:30.090> the<00:06:30.150> word<00:06:30.330> nerd<00:06:30.630> like<00:06:30.930> and<00:06:32.060> some<00:06:33.060> of

00:06:33.140 --> 00:06:33.150 
marks and the word nerd like and some of

00:06:33.150 --> 00:06:35.990 
marks and the word nerd like and some of
the<00:06:33.210> spacing<00:06:33.870> the<00:06:34.340> ends<00:06:35.340> of<00:06:35.430> these<00:06:35.550> isn't

00:06:35.990 --> 00:06:36.000 
the spacing the ends of these isn't

00:06:36.000 --> 00:06:38.810 
the spacing the ends of these isn't
quite<00:06:36.680> isn't<00:06:37.680> quite<00:06:37.890> what<00:06:38.130> I'd<00:06:38.280> like<00:06:38.460> it<00:06:38.670> to<00:06:38.790> be

00:06:38.810 --> 00:06:38.820 
quite isn't quite what I'd like it to be

00:06:38.820 --> 00:06:43.120 
quite isn't quite what I'd like it to be
and<00:06:39.720> but<00:06:40.620> overall<00:06:40.920> I'm<00:06:41.280> pretty<00:06:42.210> happy<00:06:42.360> with<00:06:42.720> it

00:06:43.120 --> 00:06:43.130 
and but overall I'm pretty happy with it

00:06:43.130 --> 00:06:48.290 
and but overall I'm pretty happy with it
um<00:06:44.130> let's<00:06:45.120> try<00:06:45.270> licensed<00:06:45.630> prices<00:06:45.960> in<00:06:47.300> of

00:06:48.290 --> 00:06:48.300 
um let's try licensed prices in of

00:06:48.300 --> 00:06:49.970 
um let's try licensed prices in of
course<00:06:48.360> it's<00:06:48.750> not<00:06:49.170> quite<00:06:49.200> big<00:06:49.500> enough<00:06:49.560> for<00:06:49.770> all

00:06:49.970 --> 00:06:49.980 
course it's not quite big enough for all

00:06:49.980 --> 00:06:57.260 
course it's not quite big enough for all
the<00:06:50.130> spices<00:06:54.560> it's<00:06:55.560> a<00:06:55.770> lot<00:06:55.980> of<00:06:56.010> them<00:06:56.250> it's<00:06:57.060> much

00:06:57.260 --> 00:06:57.270 
the spices it's a lot of them it's much

00:06:57.270 --> 00:07:03.800 
the spices it's a lot of them it's much
the<00:06:57.300> spices<00:06:58.400> and<00:06:59.400> hell<00:06:59.580> a<00:06:59.820> little<00:07:00.330> cool<00:07:02.570> so<00:07:03.570> I'm

00:07:03.800 --> 00:07:03.810 
the spices and hell a little cool so I'm

00:07:03.810 --> 00:07:06.350 
the spices and hell a little cool so I'm
at<00:07:03.990> the<00:07:04.370> standing<00:07:05.370> back<00:07:05.550> at<00:07:05.700> a<00:07:05.760> marring<00:07:06.120> stage

00:07:06.350 --> 00:07:06.360 
at the standing back at a marring stage

00:07:06.360 --> 00:07:09.080 
at the standing back at a marring stage
and<00:07:06.630> I<00:07:06.690> realize<00:07:07.020> the<00:07:07.770> bottom<00:07:08.520> section<00:07:08.790> isn't

00:07:09.080 --> 00:07:09.090 
and I realize the bottom section isn't

00:07:09.090 --> 00:07:10.550 
and I realize the bottom section isn't
really<00:07:09.360> being<00:07:09.570> used<00:07:09.780> for<00:07:10.170> anything

00:07:10.550 --> 00:07:10.560 
really being used for anything

00:07:10.560 --> 00:07:12.320 
really being used for anything
I<00:07:10.710> thought<00:07:11.040> the<00:07:11.190> overhang<00:07:11.580> would<00:07:11.820> look<00:07:12.030> right

00:07:12.320 --> 00:07:12.330 
I thought the overhang would look right

00:07:12.330 --> 00:07:15.200 
I thought the overhang would look right
but<00:07:12.720> now<00:07:13.410> that<00:07:13.590> I'm<00:07:13.680> using<00:07:13.860> the<00:07:14.010> top<00:07:14.280> overhang

00:07:15.200 --> 00:07:15.210 
but now that I'm using the top overhang

00:07:15.210 --> 00:07:17.960 
but now that I'm using the top overhang
as<00:07:15.390> another<00:07:15.570> little<00:07:15.870> shelf<00:07:16.610> it<00:07:17.610> occurred<00:07:17.940> to

00:07:17.960 --> 00:07:17.970 
as another little shelf it occurred to

00:07:17.970 --> 00:07:18.950 
as another little shelf it occurred to
me<00:07:18.120> that<00:07:18.150> maybe<00:07:18.330> I<00:07:18.390> should<00:07:18.540> do<00:07:18.600> something<00:07:18.780> with

00:07:18.950 --> 00:07:18.960 
me that maybe I should do something with

00:07:18.960 --> 00:07:21.650 
me that maybe I should do something with
a<00:07:19.020> bottom<00:07:19.290> overhang<00:07:19.650> and<00:07:19.890> I<00:07:20.790> remember<00:07:21.540> that

00:07:21.650 --> 00:07:21.660 
a bottom overhang and I remember that

00:07:21.660 --> 00:07:24.650 
a bottom overhang and I remember that
the<00:07:21.810> blinds<00:07:22.230> have<00:07:22.920> a<00:07:23.340> dowel<00:07:23.880> attached<00:07:24.330> them

00:07:24.650 --> 00:07:24.660 
the blinds have a dowel attached them

00:07:24.660 --> 00:07:26.990 
the blinds have a dowel attached them
for<00:07:24.960> adjusting<00:07:25.530> the<00:07:25.650> angle<00:07:25.740> of<00:07:25.980> the<00:07:26.250> of<00:07:26.880> the

00:07:26.990 --> 00:07:27.000 
for adjusting the angle of the of the

00:07:27.000 --> 00:07:29.540 
for adjusting the angle of the of the
slats<00:07:27.270> and<00:07:27.600> that<00:07:28.230> maybe<00:07:28.410> that'd<00:07:28.710> be<00:07:28.860> cool<00:07:29.070> to

00:07:29.540 --> 00:07:29.550 
slats and that maybe that'd be cool to

00:07:29.550 --> 00:07:33.830 
slats and that maybe that'd be cool to
hang<00:07:30.030> details<00:07:30.480> from<00:07:31.310> so<00:07:32.310> I<00:07:32.340> quickly<00:07:32.840> drilled

00:07:33.830 --> 00:07:33.840 
hang details from so I quickly drilled
