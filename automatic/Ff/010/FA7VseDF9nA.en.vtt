00:00:07.920 --> 00:00:07.930 
as our uniform supplier because we

00:00:07.930 --> 00:00:09.540 
as our uniform supplier because we

00:00:15.990 --> 00:00:16.000

accumulate<00:00:19.630> points<00:00:19.869> monthly<00:00:20.470> and<00:00:20.679> then<00:00:20.829> they

00:00:20.970 --> 00:00:20.980 
accumulate points monthly and then they

00:00:20.980 --> 00:00:22.979 
accumulate points monthly and then they
can<00:00:21.159> go<00:00:21.310> on<00:00:21.489> the<00:00:21.669> online<00:00:21.880> shopping<00:00:22.329> cart<00:00:22.659> and

00:00:28.169 --> 00:00:28.179 
currently we have about 3,000 operators

00:00:28.179 --> 00:00:30.599 
currently we have about 3,000 operators
using<00:00:28.630> the<00:00:28.989> uniform<00:00:29.229> system<00:00:29.769> there's<00:00:30.309> a<00:00:30.399> lot

00:00:30.599 --> 00:00:30.609 
using the uniform system there's a lot

00:00:30.609 --> 00:00:32.249 
using the uniform system there's a lot
more<00:00:30.759> freedom<00:00:31.029> for<00:00:31.210> them<00:00:31.479> to<00:00:31.720> be<00:00:31.839> able<00:00:31.929> to<00:00:32.079> go

00:00:32.249 --> 00:00:32.259 
more freedom for them to be able to go

00:00:32.259 --> 00:00:34.410 
more freedom for them to be able to go
onto<00:00:32.410> the<00:00:32.619> system<00:00:32.950> themselves<00:00:33.400> from<00:00:33.580> home<00:00:33.790> if

00:00:34.410 --> 00:00:34.420 
onto the system themselves from home if

00:00:34.420 --> 00:00:36.120 
onto the system themselves from home if
they<00:00:34.630> like<00:00:34.840> and<00:00:35.140> just<00:00:35.380> order<00:00:35.620> the<00:00:35.710> items<00:00:36.010> that

00:01:25.050 --> 00:01:25.060 
they have more control or what they

00:01:25.060 --> 00:01:27.059

00:01:38.200 --> 00:01:40.020 
items that they've selected are very
good<00:01:38.380> quality<00:01:38.560> and<00:01:38.979> yet<00:01:39.130> the<00:01:39.280> price<00:01:39.459> point<00:01:39.759> is

00:01:40.020 --> 00:01:40.030 
good quality and yet the price point is

00:01:40.030 --> 00:01:43.020 
good quality and yet the price point is
very<00:01:40.299> good<00:01:40.600> and<00:01:40.869> the<00:01:41.649> administrative<00:01:42.369> work

00:01:43.020 --> 00:01:43.030

00:01:45.330 --> 00:01:45.340 
that we have to do is much less so that

00:01:45.340 --> 00:01:46.559
