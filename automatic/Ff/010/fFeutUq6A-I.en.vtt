00:00:05.680 --> 00:00:08.129

00:00:08.129 --> 00:00:10.589
 continued 6 

00:00:10.589 --> 00:00:13.589
 face to date no more secret jaws for him 

00:00:14.139 --> 00:00:16.759
 to do this 

00:00:16.759 --> 00:00:20.130

00:00:22.560 --> 00:00:23.970
 your project 

00:00:23.970 --> 00:00:26.599
 who can believe that for example 

00:00:26.599 --> 00:00:29.390
 the euro has gone back to France 

00:00:29.390 --> 00:00:31.609
 a funny picture 

00:00:31.609 --> 00:00:34.949
 we are expecting to see other important players tonight 

00:00:36.830 --> 00:00:39.630
 during their talk to the world while 

00:00:39.630 --> 00:00:41.940
 after the shock the south of the island 

00:00:41.940 --> 00:00:45.390
 it's the biggest the rest of the island 

00:00:45.390 --> 00:00:48.520
 currently unemployed 

00:00:48.520 --> 00:00:51.220

00:00:51.220 --> 00:00:52.800
 the new office 

00:00:52.800 --> 00:00:55.800
 a lot of problems on both games 

00:00:56.730 --> 00:01:00.190
 I think we were splitting up 2010 

00:01:00.190 --> 00:01:02.110
 greater regulation 

00:01:02.110 --> 00:01:05.400
 located in montrouge where many siamese children many others 

00:01:05.400 --> 00:01:07.180
 euro mouse 

00:01:07.180 --> 00:01:10.180
 like many others are too 

00:01:10.180 --> 00:01:12.790
 these are the most important 

00:01:12.790 --> 00:01:15.690
 moreover the slope is soc 

00:01:15.690 --> 00:01:18.690
 we have a lot of fallout 

00:01:21.880 --> 00:01:25.070
 it still is not started 

00:01:25.070 --> 00:01:25.909

00:01:25.909 --> 00:01:27.670
 Easter 

00:01:27.670 --> 00:01:29.610
 little more pressure 

00:01:29.610 --> 00:01:33.050
 like this day 

00:01:33.050 --> 00:01:34.340
 according to the website 

00:01:34.340 --> 00:01:36.590
 at the mans endurance 

00:01:36.590 --> 00:01:39.470
 it's a good match 

00:01:39.470 --> 00:01:41.770

00:01:41.770 --> 00:01:45.060

00:01:46.060 --> 00:01:47.620

00:01:58.780 --> 00:02:00.270

00:02:00.270 --> 00:02:02.790

00:02:02.790 --> 00:02:05.460

00:02:05.460 --> 00:02:07.040
 the results less bad 

00:02:07.040 --> 00:02:08.449
 thanks to rugby 

00:02:08.449 --> 00:02:11.449
