this is evidence of my cake that's the
piece<00:00:10.790> of<00:00:11.790> the<00:00:11.940> cake<00:00:12.240> they<00:00:12.830> cut<00:00:14.480> and<00:00:15.480> this<00:00:15.690> is

00:00:15.860 --> 00:00:15.870 
piece of the cake they cut and this is

00:00:15.870 --> 00:00:21.019 
piece of the cake they cut and this is
the<00:00:16.020> piece<00:00:16.289> that<00:00:16.730> came<00:00:17.730> out<00:00:18.000> of<00:00:18.270> that<00:00:19.820> slice<00:00:20.820> of

00:00:21.019 --> 00:00:21.029 
the piece that came out of that slice of

00:00:21.029 --> 00:00:26.980 
the piece that came out of that slice of
cake<00:00:21.240> now<00:00:23.210> I'm<00:00:24.210> not<00:00:24.600> a<00:00:24.720> rocket<00:00:25.109> scientist<00:00:25.800> but

00:00:26.980 --> 00:00:26.990 
cake now I'm not a rocket scientist but

00:00:26.990 --> 00:00:35.959 
cake now I'm not a rocket scientist but
I<00:00:28.400> don't<00:00:29.400> believe<00:00:32.270> this<00:00:33.270> piece<00:00:34.579> is<00:00:35.579> the<00:00:35.790> only

00:00:35.959 --> 00:00:35.969 
I don't believe this piece is the only

00:00:35.969 --> 00:00:40.639 
I don't believe this piece is the only
piece<00:00:36.360> that<00:00:36.630> came<00:00:36.809> out<00:00:36.989> of<00:00:37.020> this<00:00:37.200> cake<00:00:39.649> so

00:00:40.639 --> 00:00:40.649 
piece that came out of this cake so

00:00:40.649 --> 00:00:44.479 
piece that came out of this cake so
therefore<00:00:42.500> there's<00:00:43.500> a<00:00:43.590> missing<00:00:44.010> piece<00:00:44.219> of

00:00:44.479 --> 00:00:44.489 
therefore there's a missing piece of

00:00:44.489 --> 00:00:46.580 
therefore there's a missing piece of
cake<00:00:44.700> I<00:00:45.059> have<00:00:45.660> are<00:00:45.840> waiting<00:00:46.140> for<00:00:46.170> me<00:00:46.289> to<00:00:46.410> pick

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:57.290 
up this or in someone's Betty now I
don't<00:00:54.000> know<00:00:55.399> it's<00:00:56.399> not<00:00:56.550> another<00:00:56.910> further

00:00:57.290 --> 00:00:57.300 
don't know it's not another further

00:00:57.300 --> 00:01:00.560 
don't know it's not another further
inspection<00:00:58.079> of<00:00:58.170> this<00:00:58.260> piece<00:00:58.500> of<00:00:58.680> cake<00:00:59.270> this<00:01:00.270> is

00:01:00.560 --> 00:01:00.570 
inspection of this piece of cake this is

00:01:00.570 --> 00:01:06.530 
inspection of this piece of cake this is
the<00:01:00.629> slice<00:01:01.309> out<00:01:02.309> of<00:01:02.370> the<00:01:03.300> cake<00:01:05.540> haven't

00:01:06.530 --> 00:01:06.540 
the slice out of the cake haven't

00:01:06.540 --> 00:01:10.600 
the slice out of the cake haven't
measured<00:01:06.689> it<00:01:07.970> but<00:01:08.970> you<00:01:09.210> can<00:01:09.450> see<00:01:09.810> the<00:01:10.080> rough

00:01:10.600 --> 00:01:10.610 
measured it but you can see the rough

00:01:10.610 --> 00:01:14.000 
measured it but you can see the rough
size<00:01:11.610> of<00:01:11.820> this<00:01:11.939> cake<00:01:12.210> so<00:01:13.200> that's<00:01:13.439> actually<00:01:13.740> the

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:14.010 
size of this cake so that's actually the

00:01:14.010 --> 00:01:17.440 
size of this cake so that's actually the
the<00:01:14.880> icing<00:01:15.330> in<00:01:15.450> part<00:01:15.720> the<00:01:16.470> wall<00:01:16.710> of<00:01:16.860> the<00:01:16.979> cake

00:01:17.440 --> 00:01:17.450 
the icing in part the wall of the cake

00:01:17.450 --> 00:01:21.490 
the icing in part the wall of the cake
so<00:01:18.450> would<00:01:18.600> you<00:01:18.659> say<00:01:18.689> that's<00:01:18.930> about<00:01:19.310> two<00:01:20.310> inches

00:01:21.490 --> 00:01:21.500 
so would you say that's about two inches

00:01:21.500 --> 00:01:25.730 
so would you say that's about two inches
okay<00:01:22.530> that's<00:01:22.979> the<00:01:23.189> quick<00:01:24.000> examination<00:01:24.740> that's

00:01:25.730 --> 00:01:25.740 
okay that's the quick examination that's

00:01:25.740 --> 00:01:30.920 
okay that's the quick examination that's
the<00:01:25.950> top<00:01:26.159> of<00:01:26.310> it<00:01:26.490> it's<00:01:27.299> a<00:01:27.420> button<00:01:28.280> this<00:01:29.900> is<00:01:30.900> a

00:01:30.920 --> 00:01:30.930 
the top of it it's a button this is a

00:01:30.930 --> 00:01:34.640 
the top of it it's a button this is a
cake<00:01:31.409> that<00:01:31.799> the<00:01:32.729> piece<00:01:32.939> came<00:01:33.119> out<00:01:33.329> of<00:01:33.600> as<00:01:34.170> you

00:01:34.640 --> 00:01:34.650 
cake that the piece came out of as you

00:01:34.650 --> 00:01:38.240 
cake that the piece came out of as you
can<00:01:34.770> see<00:01:35.270> that<00:01:36.270> looks<00:01:36.720> a<00:01:36.990> little<00:01:37.470> bit<00:01:37.829> more

00:01:38.240 --> 00:01:38.250 
can see that looks a little bit more

00:01:38.250 --> 00:01:41.630 
can see that looks a little bit more
than<00:01:38.850> two<00:01:39.180> inches<00:01:39.829> haven't<00:01:40.829> got<00:01:40.950> a<00:01:40.979> ruler<00:01:41.369> I

00:01:41.630 --> 00:01:41.640 
than two inches haven't got a ruler I

00:01:41.640 --> 00:01:46.069 
than two inches haven't got a ruler I
mean<00:01:42.299> got<00:01:42.420> a<00:01:42.450> tape<00:01:42.689> measure<00:01:42.930> but<00:01:43.729> it's<00:01:45.079> roughly

00:01:46.069 --> 00:01:46.079 
mean got a tape measure but it's roughly

00:01:46.079 --> 00:01:49.130 
mean got a tape measure but it's roughly
not<00:01:46.439> two<00:01:46.740> inches<00:01:47.130> so<00:01:47.689> two<00:01:48.689> inches<00:01:48.990> probably

00:01:49.130 --> 00:01:49.140 
not two inches so two inches probably

00:01:49.140 --> 00:01:52.700 
not two inches so two inches probably
worth<00:01:49.500> coming<00:01:49.799> back<00:01:49.829> from<00:01:50.159> there<00:01:51.560> that<00:01:52.560> means

00:01:52.700 --> 00:01:52.710 
worth coming back from there that means

00:01:52.710 --> 00:01:57.139 
worth coming back from there that means
that<00:01:53.009> piece<00:01:53.280> there<00:01:53.960> has<00:01:54.960> been<00:01:55.969> lost<00:01:56.969> in
