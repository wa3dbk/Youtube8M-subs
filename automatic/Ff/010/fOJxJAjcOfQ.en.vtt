00:00:00.860 --> 00:00:07.040
 car gustavo that are for an audience 

00:00:03.380 --> 00:00:08.990
 generic but the toyota 86 is specific 

00:00:07.040 --> 00:00:10.969
 for those who like cars 

00:00:08.990 --> 00:00:13.129
 sports and for those who feel pleasure 

00:00:10.969 --> 00:00:15.019
 to handle like that is because we are 

00:00:13.129 --> 00:00:17.000
 launching this vehicle today in a very day 

00:00:15.019 --> 00:00:18.430
 important for toyota because until the 

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:20.510
 moment the brand was coming 

00:00:18.430 --> 00:00:21.830
 Widely accepted in the market 

00:00:20.510 --> 00:00:24.110
 Argentine in the segments of we are 

00:00:21.830 --> 00:00:25.640
 participating but basically I would say with 

00:00:24.110 --> 00:00:27.950
 very rational proposals of our 

00:00:25.640 --> 00:00:29.300
 products and approaching or trying 

00:00:27.950 --> 00:00:31.700
 approaching a profile of people 

00:00:29.300 --> 00:00:34.220
 different with another kind of expectation 

00:00:31.700 --> 00:00:37.100
 well we understood that a vehicle like 

00:00:34.220 --> 00:00:39.829
 the 2 886 a really race sports car 

00:00:37.100 --> 00:00:41.120
 is a product that can widely 

00:00:39.829 --> 00:00:43.610
 satisfy our needs 

00:00:41.120 --> 00:00:45.440
 customers thinking that in Argentina 

00:00:43.610 --> 00:00:47.390
 where the users are really 

00:00:45.440 --> 00:00:49.610
 passionate about cars and the 

00:00:47.390 --> 00:00:51.020
 sports motorsport also a 

00:00:49.610 --> 00:00:53.329
 global project like I was 

00:00:51.020 --> 00:00:54.710
 raising toyota for this year was very 

00:00:53.329 --> 00:00:56.660
 important in simultaneous to be able 

00:00:54.710 --> 00:00:58.070
 also launch it in Argentina and the 

00:00:56.660 --> 00:00:59.870
 true that we had a history 

00:00:58.070 --> 00:01:02.239
 because at the auto show that 

00:00:59.870 --> 00:01:04.759
 he made the last time the year 2011 

00:01:02.239 --> 00:01:05.990
 we had brought a prototype of 86 and 

00:01:04.759 --> 00:01:07.190
 really when we saw the level of 

00:01:05.990 --> 00:01:08.780
 announcement 

00:01:07.190 --> 00:01:11.060
 and interest was part of 

00:01:08.780 --> 00:01:13.640
 public we finished making the decision 

00:01:11.060 --> 00:01:15.590
 to introduce this car here and I say it's a 

00:01:13.640 --> 00:01:17.300
 very important day because start 

00:01:15.590 --> 00:01:19.970
 get closer to the Argentine public with 

00:01:17.300 --> 00:01:21.530
 proposals that are not only highlighted 

00:01:19.970 --> 00:01:23.450
 of the rational but also from 

00:01:21.530 --> 00:01:25.010
 the emotional good is important because 

00:01:23.450 --> 00:01:26.720
 we also have in the future and more 

00:01:25.010 --> 00:01:28.460
 precisely next year the 

00:01:26.720 --> 00:01:30.260
 introduction of the compact lithium car 

00:01:28.460 --> 00:01:31.600
 and again it is to go closer 

00:01:30.260 --> 00:01:35.510
 gradually to a different audience 

00:01:31.600 --> 00:01:38.060
 because 86 the name of 86 has its 

00:01:35.510 --> 00:01:40.010
 origin in two factors one linked to 

00:01:38.060 --> 00:01:43.460
 a history of toyota in the world that 

00:01:40.010 --> 00:01:45.170
 it's at the time we had the toyota 86 

00:01:43.460 --> 00:01:47.450
 made in japan that was a vehicle 

00:01:45.170 --> 00:01:49.400
 sport that was a reference in the 

00:01:47.450 --> 00:01:52.010
 Japanese market and in many markets of the 

00:01:49.400 --> 00:01:52.940
 world from there takes part of the name and 

00:01:52.010 --> 00:01:54.260
 second has to do with the 

00:01:52.940 --> 00:01:56.570
 motorization of the car 

00:01:54.260 --> 00:01:59.420
 This car has a boxer engine and in 

00:01:56.570 --> 00:02:01.790
 case what you have is to the extent of 

00:01:59.420 --> 00:02:04.400
 pistons the diameter of the race of the 

00:02:01.790 --> 00:02:06.650
 piston measure every 186 millimeters 

00:02:04.400 --> 00:02:09.429
 respectively or 6 86 x 86 millimeters 

00:02:06.650 --> 00:02:11.200
 that square configuration 

00:02:09.429 --> 00:02:13.269
 motor and the diameter of the pistons and the 

00:02:11.200 --> 00:02:15.129
 race of the same made him be the 

00:02:13.269 --> 00:02:19.299
 second factor by which it was decided 

00:02:15.129 --> 00:02:21.969
 name this car 86 that in Japanese of 

00:02:19.299 --> 00:02:23.500
 way to name it is hachiro that is 

00:02:21.969 --> 00:02:25.659
 a way also of good power 

00:02:23.500 --> 00:02:27.579
 share a bit of how in the world they 

00:02:25.659 --> 00:02:29.889
 is knowing this car regarding the 

00:02:27.579 --> 00:02:32.319
 design was taken as inspiration to 2007 

00:02:29.889 --> 00:02:34.719
 that was a toyota classic in mid 

00:02:32.319 --> 00:02:37.599
 of the decade 60 so is the lines of 

00:02:34.719 --> 00:02:39.849
 this car are inspired in 2007 

00:02:37.599 --> 00:02:42.010
 that was a car that was an icon too 

00:02:39.849 --> 00:02:43.900
 back then of toyota in terms of 

00:02:42.010 --> 00:02:46.480
 sports cars and that if you look at it 

00:02:43.900 --> 00:02:47.739
 especially from the profile you will notice and 

00:02:46.480 --> 00:02:49.930
 will observe that the lines are very 

00:02:47.739 --> 00:02:52.180
 similar in terms of the mechanics just 

00:02:49.930 --> 00:02:53.980
 He announced that it is a boxer motor of 2 

00:02:52.180 --> 00:02:57.010
 liters 200 horses so is it has 

00:02:53.980 --> 00:02:58.569
 rear- wheel drive this engine for me what 

00:02:57.010 --> 00:03:00.129
 which has the most important of the car in 

00:02:58.569 --> 00:03:02.409
 regarding his performance in the relationship 

00:03:00.129 --> 00:03:04.569
 of weight strengthens the price ratio 

00:03:02.409 --> 00:03:06.849
 power of 6.5 kilos per each of 

00:03:04.569 --> 00:03:09.159
 the horses that this engine provides and 

00:03:06.849 --> 00:03:11.950
 that really on the one hand they make him give 

00:03:09.159 --> 00:03:13.479
 one everything you can get out of a 

00:03:11.950 --> 00:03:16.100
 sports features vehicle 

00:03:13.479 --> 00:03:18.200
 like 86 but ensuring in all 

00:03:16.100 --> 00:03:19.550
 the control one has over the car 

00:03:18.200 --> 00:03:21.070
 in such a way that the condition of 

00:03:19.550 --> 00:03:23.090
 security is permanently 

00:03:21.070 --> 00:03:26.090
 established we have a box of 

00:03:23.090 --> 00:03:27.650
 transmission of six gears and manual and 

00:03:26.090 --> 00:03:28.220
 an automatic box also of six 

00:03:27.650 --> 00:03:30.110
 marches 

00:03:28.220 --> 00:03:32.750
 in this case sequential with the 

00:03:30.110 --> 00:03:35.210
 to command the feature by 

00:03:32.750 --> 00:03:36.740
 keep by means of cams on the steering wheel and 

00:03:35.210 --> 00:03:38.240
 that as a distinctive feature what 

00:03:36.740 --> 00:03:39.740
 that it has that one can make recesses to 

00:03:38.240 --> 00:03:41.360
 despite being an automatic box of the 

00:03:39.740 --> 00:03:43.400
 steering wheel which is also very 

00:03:41.360 --> 00:03:45.620
 fun when handling it to 

00:03:43.400 --> 00:03:47.150
 despite being the 86 a car clearly 

00:03:45.620 --> 00:03:50.930
 sporting safety equipment 

00:03:47.150 --> 00:03:52.520
 it's complete so it's not because it's a car 

00:03:50.930 --> 00:03:53.780
 sporting must be relegated at all 

00:03:52.520 --> 00:03:55.970
 the security conditions very by the 

00:03:53.780 --> 00:03:57.440
 otherwise we have to reinforce the is 

00:03:55.970 --> 00:03:59.510
 so the level of equipment that 

00:03:57.440 --> 00:04:01.250
 he has the car of course he has abs 

00:03:59.510 --> 00:04:03.560
 electronic braking distribution 

00:04:01.250 --> 00:04:06.080
 braking assistance but it also has 

00:04:03.560 --> 00:04:07.760
 a traction and stability control that 

00:04:06.080 --> 00:04:09.410
 It can be sealed in five 

00:04:07.760 --> 00:04:11.360
 different programs so that 

00:04:09.410 --> 00:04:13.430
 the client according to his driving to 

00:04:11.360 --> 00:04:14.920
 your type of driving can take the 

00:04:13.430 --> 00:04:16.820
 higher vehicle performance 

00:04:14.920 --> 00:04:18.770
 permanently securing 

00:04:16.820 --> 00:04:21.049
 security conditions and on the other hand 

00:04:18.770 --> 00:04:23.840
 in terms of passive safety 

00:04:21.049 --> 00:04:25.789
 the vehicle has nine airbags of both 

00:04:23.840 --> 00:04:27.979
 front side curtain like airbag 

00:04:25.789 --> 00:04:29.870
 on his knees that x is a characteristic 

00:04:27.979 --> 00:04:32.780
 different for category cars there 

00:04:29.870 --> 00:04:34.069
 three versions available species 86 

00:04:32.780 --> 00:04:36.860
 in manual transmission that has a 

00:04:34.069 --> 00:04:38.780
 price of 44 thousand 900 dollars and after 

00:04:36.860 --> 00:04:41.780
 we have gt versions in transmission 

00:04:38.780 --> 00:04:44.330
 manual and automatic with a price of 60 

00:04:41.780 --> 00:04:46.900
 one thousand 200 dollars and 63 thousand 300 dollars 

00:04:44.330 --> 00:04:46.900
 respectively
