00:00:00.030 --> 00:00:04.410
 hello now I will show you how it looks 

00:00:02.250 --> 00:00:05.879
 intel processor through the official 

00:00:04.410 --> 00:00:09.240
 program lindover 3 

00:00:05.879 --> 00:00:12.090
 so download tonometer from the official 

00:00:09.240 --> 00:00:14.880
 Site link will be in the description and also it 

00:00:12.090 --> 00:00:17.830
 useful programs 164 

00:00:14.880 --> 00:00:22.830
 I will also leave in the description 

00:00:17.830 --> 00:00:22.830
 even intel program filters 

00:00:23.240 --> 00:00:26.570
 now this one 

00:00:25.039 --> 00:00:29.030
 pops up warning that not 

00:00:26.570 --> 00:00:32.380
 confectionery processor 

00:00:29.030 --> 00:00:32.380
 we miss 

00:00:34.070 --> 00:00:36.489
 are sitting 

00:00:38.160 --> 00:00:42.130
 even a sports program 

00:00:40.290 --> 00:00:46.080
 how will 2 

00:00:42.130 --> 00:00:46.080
 and another program aida64 

00:00:46.350 --> 00:00:50.149
 since the CPU temperature 

00:00:51.740 --> 00:00:57.300
 in this area we turn to some 

00:00:55.000 --> 00:00:57.300
 pens 

00:00:58.380 --> 00:01:03.280
 our temperature 

00:00:59.990 --> 00:01:03.280
 67 layers friend 

00:01:03.320 --> 00:01:06.370
 quite a lot 

00:01:05.330 --> 00:01:09.409
 muzzle on 

00:01:06.370 --> 00:01:11.869
 yet slobodchikova 

00:01:09.409 --> 00:01:14.090
 and in the program 

00:01:11.869 --> 00:01:15.820
 squad we go baku 

00:01:14.090 --> 00:01:17.960
 doll cults 

00:01:15.820 --> 00:01:20.620
 see something 

00:01:17.960 --> 00:01:21.610
 they will happen 

00:01:20.620 --> 00:01:23.760
 four 

00:01:21.610 --> 00:01:25.560
 is coming 

00:01:23.760 --> 00:01:27.750
 if you have 

00:01:25.560 --> 00:01:31.640
 starting 

00:01:27.750 --> 00:01:31.640
 turbo core then even we 

00:01:31.720 --> 00:01:34.560
 here 

00:01:36.180 --> 00:01:38.930
 and even 

00:01:41.290 --> 00:01:47.030
 if you put here Galushko 

00:01:44.140 --> 00:01:50.080
 just turn it on 

00:01:47.030 --> 00:01:51.720
 remove the tick press grater 

00:01:50.080 --> 00:01:55.040
 farther 

00:01:51.720 --> 00:01:55.040
 shower. 

00:01:55.510 --> 00:02:00.010
 so that we increase the frequency but 

00:01:57.970 --> 00:02:02.140
 you just need to move someone slider 

00:02:00.010 --> 00:02:05.070
 right and left 

00:02:02.140 --> 00:02:05.070
 accidental failure 

00:02:05.580 --> 00:02:10.580
 look look here frequency 

00:02:08.130 --> 00:02:12.319
 which we have 

00:02:10.580 --> 00:02:13.470
 after acceleration 

00:02:12.319 --> 00:02:17.060
 I 

00:02:13.470 --> 00:02:17.060
 set to 43 

00:02:19.360 --> 00:02:22.530
 with 

00:02:20.230 --> 00:02:22.530
 So 

00:02:26.480 --> 00:02:31.989
 all and slightly increase were also 

00:02:33.350 --> 00:02:35.890
 a little bit 

00:02:39.510 --> 00:02:43.050
 you what 

00:02:41.610 --> 00:02:44.520
 like this 

00:02:43.050 --> 00:02:46.850
 and push 

00:02:44.520 --> 00:02:46.850
 ok 

00:02:50.270 --> 00:02:55.819
 we have here and now say here the window 

00:02:53.660 --> 00:02:57.849
 with a warning 

00:02:55.819 --> 00:02:57.849
 and 

00:02:58.030 --> 00:03:02.450
 again skip 

00:03:00.540 --> 00:03:05.120
 and we all have a program with 

00:03:02.450 --> 00:03:06.270
 this processor turns on now 

00:03:05.120 --> 00:03:08.610
 you can burn 

00:03:06.270 --> 00:03:10.440
 what title now 

00:03:08.610 --> 00:03:13.200
 antivirus 

00:03:10.440 --> 00:03:14.490
 much increased here she will 

00:03:13.200 --> 00:03:17.750
 go down 

00:03:14.490 --> 00:03:17.750
 since the fan will start 

00:03:18.750 --> 00:03:23.379
 so all but dispersed the processor 

00:03:21.340 --> 00:03:27.569
 thanks for watching subscribe to 

00:03:23.379 --> 00:03:27.569
 channel we like everybody bye bye
