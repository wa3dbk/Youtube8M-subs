00:02:36.270 --> 00:02:36.280 
simply put a bottom aim and why is that

00:02:36.280 --> 00:02:39.449 
simply put a bottom aim and why is that
TNT<00:02:36.790> a<00:02:36.820> very<00:02:37.270> long<00:02:37.630> way<00:02:37.860> you<00:02:38.860> can<00:02:39.010> have<00:02:39.220> the

00:02:44.040 --> 00:02:44.050 
four repeaters if you want the 5 is 5 is

00:02:44.050 --> 00:02:47.940 
four repeaters if you want the 5 is 5 is
the<00:02:44.170> best<00:02:44.550> 5<00:02:45.550> is<00:02:45.670> my<00:02:45.790> favorite<00:02:46.260> all<00:02:47.260> right<00:02:47.380> now

00:02:52.280 --> 00:02:52.290 
for the clock we're going to put out

00:02:52.290 --> 00:02:56.039 
for the clock we're going to put out
some<00:02:53.290> redstone<00:02:53.470> like<00:02:53.830> this<00:02:54.040> and<00:02:54.400> then<00:02:55.049> this

00:02:56.039 --> 00:02:56.049 
some redstone like this and then this

00:02:56.049 --> 00:03:02.190 
some redstone like this and then this
way<00:02:56.320> we're<00:02:56.799> going<00:02:56.830> to<00:02:57.040> put<00:02:58.019> 6<00:02:59.019> repeaters<00:03:01.200> sorry

00:03:02.190 --> 00:03:02.200 
way we're going to put 6 repeaters sorry

00:03:02.200 --> 00:03:08.640 
way we're going to put 6 repeaters sorry
6<00:03:02.799> repairs<00:03:03.450> to<00:03:04.450> repairs<00:03:06.000> right<00:03:07.000> and<00:03:07.810> then

00:03:08.640 --> 00:03:08.650 
6 repairs to repairs right and then

00:03:08.650 --> 00:03:09.930 
6 repairs to repairs right and then
we're<00:03:08.769> going<00:03:08.890> to<00:03:08.920> have<00:03:09.100> 2<00:03:09.370> repeaters<00:03:09.670> going

00:03:09.930 --> 00:03:09.940 
we're going to have 2 repeaters going

00:03:09.940 --> 00:03:15.030 
we're going to have 2 repeaters going
the<00:03:10.030> other<00:03:10.090> way<00:03:13.620> and<00:03:14.620> then<00:03:14.799> we're<00:03:14.890> going<00:03:14.980> to

00:03:15.030 --> 00:03:15.040 
the other way and then we're going to

00:03:15.040 --> 00:03:17.460 
the other way and then we're going to
connect<00:03:15.340> this<00:03:15.459> up<00:03:15.640> with<00:03:15.760> redstone<00:03:16.470> now

00:03:17.460 --> 00:03:17.470 
connect this up with redstone now

00:03:17.470 --> 00:03:19.500 
connect this up with redstone now
basically<00:03:18.280> what's<00:03:18.610> going<00:03:18.790> to<00:03:18.820> happen<00:03:19.120> here<00:03:19.329> is

00:03:19.500 --> 00:03:19.510 
basically what's going to happen here is

00:03:19.510 --> 00:03:21.870 
basically what's going to happen here is
when<00:03:20.230> I<00:03:20.260> press<00:03:20.500> this<00:03:20.620> button<00:03:20.860> it's<00:03:21.700> going<00:03:21.820> to

00:03:21.870 --> 00:03:21.880 
when I press this button it's going to

00:03:21.880 --> 00:03:24.300 
when I press this button it's going to
send<00:03:22.150> a<00:03:22.239> pulse<00:03:22.420> around<00:03:22.900> this<00:03:23.019> way<00:03:23.260> and<00:03:23.500> then

00:03:24.300 --> 00:03:24.310 
send a pulse around this way and then

00:03:24.310 --> 00:03:25.770 
send a pulse around this way and then
when<00:03:24.459> I<00:03:24.489> get<00:03:24.640> T<00:03:24.820> it's<00:03:25.180> going<00:03:25.360> to<00:03:25.420> send<00:03:25.540> a<00:03:25.630> pulse

00:03:25.770 --> 00:03:25.780 
when I get T it's going to send a pulse

00:03:25.780 --> 00:03:27.090 
when I get T it's going to send a pulse
both<00:03:26.079> one<00:03:26.290> so<00:03:26.470> it's<00:03:26.590> going<00:03:26.680> to<00:03:26.769> send<00:03:26.890> a<00:03:26.980> pulse

00:03:27.090 --> 00:03:27.100 
both one so it's going to send a pulse

00:03:27.100 --> 00:03:30.000 
both one so it's going to send a pulse
out<00:03:27.370> here<00:03:27.579> start<00:03:28.480> a<00:03:28.540> firing<00:03:28.959> everyone's<00:03:29.829> gonna

00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:30.010 
out here start a firing everyone's gonna

out here start a firing everyone's gonna
go<00:03:30.640> this<00:03:30.790> way<00:03:30.850> again<00:03:31.180> and<00:03:31.840> when<00:03:31.989> it<00:03:32.079> gets<00:03:32.230> to

00:03:32.340 --> 00:03:32.350 
go this way again and when it gets to

00:03:32.350 --> 00:03:34.650 
go this way again and when it gets to
this<00:03:32.500> block<00:03:32.829> the<00:03:33.549> button<00:03:33.850> will<00:03:33.970> depress<00:03:34.329> and

00:03:34.650 --> 00:03:34.660 
this block the button will depress and

00:03:34.660 --> 00:03:37.590 
this block the button will depress and
we'll<00:03:35.380> go<00:03:35.530> around<00:03:35.739> again<00:03:36.180> send<00:03:37.180> a<00:03:37.209> pulse<00:03:37.329> up<00:03:37.540> to

00:03:37.590 --> 00:03:37.600 
we'll go around again send a pulse up to

00:03:37.600 --> 00:03:39.569 
we'll go around again send a pulse up to
here<00:03:37.870> and<00:03:38.110> so<00:03:38.590> on<00:03:38.680> and<00:03:38.709> so<00:03:38.950> on<00:03:38.980> so<00:03:39.250> it's
