00:00:01.700 --> 00:00:14.629
 hello, everyone was not asked to do so 

00:00:07.090 --> 00:00:19.210
 parsing iphone 5c Chinese right now 

00:00:14.629 --> 00:00:21.990
 try to make out a look something 

00:00:19.210 --> 00:00:21.990
 turn off the machine 

00:00:24.520 --> 00:00:37.670
 remove silicone case 

00:00:30.949 --> 00:00:37.670
 so we need a special screwdriver 

00:00:39.450 --> 00:00:43.500
 very small cross 

00:00:45.960 --> 00:00:56.449
 So in the bottom of the iPhone is 

00:00:50.460 --> 00:00:56.449
 warrior, that's them, and we need to unscrew 

00:01:11.170 --> 00:01:16.390
 i.e. 2 

00:01:20.190 --> 00:01:22.370
 there is 

00:01:22.830 --> 00:01:29.780
 second there is so much 

00:01:33.510 --> 00:01:36.750
 take a spatula 

00:01:40.450 --> 00:01:49.469
 and here she went 

00:01:53.010 --> 00:02:08.250
 you need to pull out the sim card slot under the sim 

00:02:00.010 --> 00:02:08.250
 dragged so as not to interfere it snaps off 

00:02:12.020 --> 00:02:14.470
 one to 

00:02:15.300 --> 00:02:17.630
 of the market 

00:02:18.390 --> 00:02:21.390
 scrutiny 

00:02:21.790 --> 00:02:23.969
 So 

00:02:32.410 --> 00:02:39.440
 as we see on this part of the back cover 

00:02:37.490 --> 00:02:48.650
 it is generally not responsible for 

00:02:39.440 --> 00:02:54.590
 antenna in optically notice guys that 

00:02:48.650 --> 00:02:59.000
 He found 16gb flash card can be 

00:02:54.590 --> 00:03:03.340
 replace in this unit was already in 

00:02:59.000 --> 00:03:03.340
 bundled over the hill if not here 

00:03:04.640 --> 00:03:12.770
 I apologize or something else you can 

00:03:09.730 --> 00:03:16.580
 increase decrease someone like that 

00:03:12.770 --> 00:03:21.430
 battery can be detached principle 

00:03:16.580 --> 00:03:21.430
 will replace the battery 

00:03:23.390 --> 00:03:36.560
 3-inch lightning connector 

00:03:29.260 --> 00:03:40.490
 speaker flash card connector on the camera so 

00:03:36.560 --> 00:03:45.680
 This is the sensor cable connector button 

00:03:40.490 --> 00:03:48.140
 inclusions here but in principle even 

00:03:45.680 --> 00:03:50.260
 disassemble as it makes no sense special 

00:03:48.140 --> 00:03:58.270
 if something breaks in someone 

00:03:50.260 --> 00:04:02.140
 unscrew the screws that's all in principle 

00:03:58.270 --> 00:04:02.140
 can be eliminated 

00:04:09.350 --> 00:04:20.510
 here are the elements of exclusion 

00:04:16.150 --> 00:04:23.150
 But if I still have this 100 

00:04:20.510 --> 00:04:27.140
 some time I'll try to replace 

00:04:23.150 --> 00:04:31.460
 The battery keeps the principle well, looking 

00:04:27.140 --> 00:04:37.160
 as a people and a half days is the maximum in 

00:04:31.460 --> 00:04:37.670
 principle from the original iPhones can 

00:04:37.160 --> 00:04:42.730
 take off 

00:04:37.670 --> 00:04:44.440
 size they have the same pull connector 

00:04:42.730 --> 00:04:48.800
 unsolder here here 

00:04:44.440 --> 00:04:58.540
 Solder to collect basically nothing 

00:04:48.800 --> 00:05:04.690
 Difficult in this is not the principle of color 

00:04:58.540 --> 00:05:04.690
 that's the same roof you can thank you all 

00:05:05.670 --> 00:05:12.780

 don't know look with you 

00:05:17.760 --> 00:05:23.300
 this whole thing is going to 

00:05:20.310 --> 00:05:26.300
 in the same way elementary nothing complicated 

00:05:23.300 --> 00:05:26.300
 here 

00:06:27.380 --> 00:06:37.050
