another<00:02:05.959> thing<00:02:06.080> you<00:02:06.110> notice<00:02:06.380> is<00:02:06.500> this<00:02:06.619> big<00:02:06.830> old

00:02:06.969 --> 00:02:06.979 
another thing you notice is this big old

00:02:06.979 --> 00:02:09.759 
another thing you notice is this big old
liver<00:02:07.250> two<00:02:07.909> giant<00:02:08.269> pieces<00:02:08.450> of<00:02:08.690> liver<00:02:08.869> liver

00:02:09.759 --> 00:02:09.769 
liver two giant pieces of liver liver

00:02:09.769 --> 00:02:12.699 
liver two giant pieces of liver liver
factors<00:02:10.549> more<00:02:11.150> than<00:02:11.269> two<00:02:11.390> lobes<00:02:11.600> the<00:02:12.380> liver<00:02:12.620> is

00:02:12.699 --> 00:02:12.709 
factors more than two lobes the liver is

00:02:12.709 --> 00:02:14.530 
factors more than two lobes the liver is
big<00:02:12.920> for<00:02:13.040> a<00:02:13.100> couple<00:02:13.340> reasons<00:02:13.370> houses<00:02:14.239> a<00:02:14.269> lot<00:02:14.450> of

00:02:14.530 --> 00:02:14.540 
big for a couple reasons houses a lot of

00:02:14.540 --> 00:02:17.080 
big for a couple reasons houses a lot of
oils<00:02:14.920> help<00:02:15.920> to<00:02:16.069> shark<00:02:16.280> with<00:02:16.430> buoyancy<00:02:16.760> helps

00:02:17.080 --> 00:02:17.090 
oils help to shark with buoyancy helps

00:02:17.090 --> 00:02:19.809 
oils help to shark with buoyancy helps
it<00:02:17.180> to<00:02:17.299> float<00:02:17.569> it<00:02:18.470> also<00:02:18.950> houses<00:02:19.190> a<00:02:19.400> lot<00:02:19.700> of

it to float it also houses a lot of

00:02:19.819 --> 00:02:21.880 
it to float it also houses a lot of
metabolic<00:02:20.180> waste<00:02:20.420> products<00:02:20.810> so<00:02:21.350> it<00:02:21.440> keeps<00:02:21.650> the

00:02:21.880 --> 00:02:21.890 
metabolic waste products so it keeps the

00:02:21.890 --> 00:02:24.190 
metabolic waste products so it keeps the
shark<00:02:22.160> kind<00:02:22.670> of<00:02:22.760> closer<00:02:23.299> to<00:02:23.420> being<00:02:23.660> isotonic

00:02:24.190 --> 00:02:24.200 
shark kind of closer to being isotonic

00:02:24.200 --> 00:02:26.920 
shark kind of closer to being isotonic
with<00:02:24.320> this<00:02:24.470> environment<00:02:25.690> here<00:02:26.690> we<00:02:26.750> have<00:02:26.840> the

00:02:26.920 --> 00:02:26.930 
with this environment here we have the

00:02:26.930 --> 00:02:29.289 
with this environment here we have the
stomach<00:02:27.310> big<00:02:28.310> stomach<00:02:28.609> now<00:02:28.820> stomach<00:02:29.150> is

00:02:29.289 --> 00:02:29.299 
stomach big stomach now stomach is

00:02:29.299 --> 00:02:31.300 
stomach big stomach now stomach is
expandable<00:02:29.840> and<00:02:30.440> we<00:02:30.530> open<00:02:30.829> the<00:02:30.890> stomach<00:02:31.040> up

00:02:31.300 --> 00:02:31.310 
expandable and we open the stomach up

00:02:31.310 --> 00:02:33.520 
expandable and we open the stomach up
we've<00:02:31.459> found<00:02:31.780> some<00:02:32.780> stuff<00:02:33.019> inside<00:02:33.380> the

kind<00:03:16.630> of<00:03:16.660> see<00:03:16.780> the<00:03:16.900> difference<00:03:17.260> in<00:03:17.349> color

00:03:17.550 --> 00:03:17.560 
kind of see the difference in color

00:03:17.560 --> 00:03:19.890 
kind of see the difference in color
that's<00:03:18.040> a<00:03:18.160> piece<00:03:18.310> of<00:03:18.340> the<00:03:18.520> pancreas<00:03:18.840> then<00:03:19.840> we

00:03:19.890 --> 00:03:19.900 
that's a piece of the pancreas then we

00:03:19.900 --> 00:03:22.410 
that's a piece of the pancreas then we
have<00:03:19.989> another<00:03:20.050> piece<00:03:20.470> of<00:03:20.620> the<00:03:20.709> pancreas<00:03:21.420> they

00:03:22.410 --> 00:03:22.420 
have another piece of the pancreas they

00:03:22.420 --> 00:03:24.150 
have another piece of the pancreas they
have<00:03:22.540> a<00:03:22.600> hard<00:03:22.720> time<00:03:22.840> finding<00:03:23.290> initially<00:03:23.950> there

00:03:24.150 --> 00:03:24.160 
have a hard time finding initially there

00:03:24.160 --> 00:03:26.340 
have a hard time finding initially there
it<00:03:24.580> is<00:03:24.840> there's<00:03:25.840> a<00:03:25.930> piece<00:03:26.110> right<00:03:26.200> here

00:03:26.340 --> 00:03:26.350 
it is there's a piece right here

00:03:26.350 --> 00:03:28.470 
it is there's a piece right here
pointing<00:03:27.280> with<00:03:27.400> my<00:03:27.519> thumb<00:03:27.790> I<00:03:28.000> broke<00:03:28.450> it

00:03:28.470 --> 00:03:28.480 
pointing with my thumb I broke it

00:03:28.480 --> 00:03:31.589 
pointing with my thumb I broke it
earlier<00:03:29.100> and<00:03:30.120> oftentimes<00:03:31.120> you<00:03:31.330> can<00:03:31.450> see<00:03:31.540> it

00:03:31.589 --> 00:03:31.599 
earlier and oftentimes you can see it

00:03:31.599 --> 00:03:33.570 
earlier and oftentimes you can see it
over<00:03:31.750> here<00:03:31.780> there<00:03:32.050> is<00:03:32.250> little<00:03:33.250> piece<00:03:33.400> of<00:03:33.519> the

00:03:33.570 --> 00:03:33.580 
over here there is little piece of the

00:03:33.580 --> 00:03:36.479 
over here there is little piece of the
pancreas<00:03:34.440> and<00:03:35.440> then<00:03:35.800> this<00:03:36.010> piece<00:03:36.190> is<00:03:36.370> called

00:03:36.479 --> 00:03:36.489 
pancreas and then this piece is called

00:03:36.489 --> 00:03:40.949 
pancreas and then this piece is called
the<00:03:36.700> ileum<00:03:38.489> okay<00:03:39.489> physical<00:03:40.060> de<00:03:40.150> Liam<00:03:40.360> it's<00:03:40.810> a

structures in there we'll open that up a

00:03:47.080 --> 00:03:49.289 
structures in there we'll open that up a
little<00:03:47.590> bit<00:03:47.769> we'll<00:03:47.920> get<00:03:48.040> inside<00:03:48.310> there<00:03:48.489> here's

00:03:49.289 --> 00:03:49.299 
little bit we'll get inside there here's

00:03:49.299 --> 00:03:51.270 
little bit we'll get inside there here's
