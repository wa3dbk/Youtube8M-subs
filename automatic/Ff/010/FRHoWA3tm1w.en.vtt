bokor m-type folder see this is g 10

00:00:18.620 --> 00:00:22.830 
bokor m-type folder see this is g 10
the<00:00:19.310> other<00:00:19.490> side<00:00:19.790> is<00:00:20.000> stainless<00:00:20.360> steel<00:00:20.950> with<00:00:21.950> a

00:00:22.830 --> 00:00:22.840 
the other side is stainless steel with a

00:00:22.840 --> 00:00:26.860 
the other side is stainless steel with a
titanium<00:00:23.840> based<00:00:24.800> coding<00:00:25.420> they<00:00:26.420> don't<00:00:26.630> say

00:00:26.860 --> 00:00:26.870 
titanium based coding they don't say

00:00:26.870 --> 00:00:29.350 
titanium based coding they don't say
whether<00:00:27.110> it's<00:00:27.380> titanium<00:00:27.830> oxide<00:00:28.580> or<00:00:28.790> nitride

00:00:29.350 --> 00:00:29.360 
whether it's titanium oxide or nitride

00:00:29.360 --> 00:00:37.120 
whether it's titanium oxide or nitride
but<00:00:29.780> probably<00:00:30.620> one<00:00:30.890> of<00:00:30.920> those<00:00:35.650> here<00:00:36.650> is<00:00:36.890> the

00:00:37.120 --> 00:00:37.130 
but probably one of those here is the

00:00:37.130 --> 00:00:41.890 
but probably one of those here is the
knife<00:00:37.510> the<00:00:38.510> blade<00:00:38.540> itself<00:00:40.360> you<00:00:41.360> can<00:00:41.390> see<00:00:41.750> it's

00:00:41.890 --> 00:00:41.900 
knife the blade itself you can see it's

00:00:41.900 --> 00:00:46.299 
knife the blade itself you can see it's
an<00:00:42.080> extra-wide<00:00:43.510> design<00:00:44.510> with<00:00:44.870> a<00:00:44.900> bevel<00:00:45.380> it's

00:00:46.299 --> 00:00:46.309 
an extra-wide design with a bevel it's

00:00:46.309 --> 00:00:52.270 
an extra-wide design with a bevel it's
hollow<00:00:46.670> ground<00:00:49.420> 3.5<00:00:50.420> inches<00:00:50.870> in<00:00:51.110> blade<00:00:51.949> length

this knife it's currently going for

00:00:58.940 --> 00:01:07.450 
this knife it's currently going for
forty<00:00:59.330> dollars<00:00:59.809> on<00:01:00.670> Amazon<00:01:04.840> side<00:01:05.840> it<00:01:06.560> is<00:01:07.430> a

00:01:07.450 --> 00:01:07.460 
forty dollars on Amazon side it is a

00:01:07.460 --> 00:01:11.890 
forty dollars on Amazon side it is a
frame<00:01:08.000> lock<00:01:08.300> design<00:01:09.909> which<00:01:10.909> makes<00:01:11.180> it<00:01:11.360> extra

00:01:11.890 --> 00:01:11.900 
frame lock design which makes it extra

00:01:11.900 --> 00:01:19.030 
frame lock design which makes it extra
slim<00:01:13.030> open<00:01:14.030> pillar<00:01:14.350> construction<00:01:16.180> and<00:01:17.860> it<00:01:18.860> is

00:01:19.030 --> 00:01:19.040 
slim open pillar construction and it is

00:01:19.040 --> 00:01:25.810 
slim open pillar construction and it is
a<00:01:19.070> fairly<00:01:19.700> heavy<00:01:20.330> knife<00:01:21.250> it's<00:01:22.250> 5.1<00:01:23.210> ounces<00:01:24.820> one

00:01:25.810 --> 00:01:25.820 
a fairly heavy knife it's 5.1 ounces one

00:01:25.820 --> 00:01:28.270 
a fairly heavy knife it's 5.1 ounces one
site<00:01:26.120> listed<00:01:26.630> it<00:01:26.780> as<00:01:27.020> a<00:01:27.050> four<00:01:27.740> point<00:01:28.010> six

00:01:28.270 --> 00:01:28.280 
site listed it as a four point six

00:01:28.280 --> 00:01:30.880 
site listed it as a four point six
ounces<00:01:28.880> but<00:01:29.420> I<00:01:29.720> think<00:01:30.050> that's<00:01:30.440> an<00:01:30.650> error

00:01:30.880 --> 00:01:30.890 
ounces but I think that's an error

00:01:30.890 --> 00:01:33.790 
ounces but I think that's an error
because<00:01:31.460> it<00:01:31.760> does<00:01:32.030> feel<00:01:32.390> very<00:01:32.660> heavy<00:01:33.320> even<00:01:33.620> for

00:01:33.790 --> 00:01:33.800 
because it does feel very heavy even for

00:01:33.800 --> 00:01:37.570 
because it does feel very heavy even for
its<00:01:34.390> slimness<00:01:35.390> because<00:01:36.350> I<00:01:36.470> mean<00:01:36.620> this<00:01:36.740> is<00:01:36.950> this

00:01:37.570 --> 00:01:37.580 
its slimness because I mean this is this

00:01:37.580 --> 00:01:40.090 
its slimness because I mean this is this
is<00:01:37.820> solid<00:01:38.330> metal<00:01:38.720> here<00:01:39.050> this<00:01:39.500> whole<00:01:39.710> side<00:01:40.040> of

00:01:40.090 --> 00:01:40.100 
is solid metal here this whole side of

00:01:40.100 --> 00:01:46.000 
is solid metal here this whole side of
the<00:01:40.250> frame<00:01:42.460> as<00:01:44.080> ambidextrous<00:01:45.080> thumb<00:01:45.140> studs<00:01:45.740> as

00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:46.010 
the frame as ambidextrous thumb studs as

00:01:46.010 --> 00:01:48.880 
the frame as ambidextrous thumb studs as
its<00:01:46.820> opening<00:01:47.270> feature<00:01:47.570> and<00:01:48.350> you<00:01:48.440> see<00:01:48.620> it<00:01:48.710> does

00:01:48.880 --> 00:01:48.890 
its opening feature and you see it does

00:01:48.890 --> 00:01:53.590 
its opening feature and you see it does
have<00:01:49.100> some<00:01:49.550> cut<00:01:49.820> outs<00:01:49.850> here<00:01:50.390> a<00:01:51.200> non<00:01:51.860> tubed<00:01:52.600> non

00:01:53.590 --> 00:01:53.600 
have some cut outs here a non tubed non

00:01:53.600 --> 00:01:58.540 
have some cut outs here a non tubed non
tube<00:01:53.960> lanyard<00:01:54.530> hole<00:01:54.790> there<00:01:56.950> the<00:01:57.950> rather<00:01:58.220> wide

00:01:58.540 --> 00:01:58.550 
tube lanyard hole there the rather wide

00:01:58.550 --> 00:02:03.580 
tube lanyard hole there the rather wide
clip<00:01:59.020> comes<00:02:00.020> with<00:02:00.470> a<00:02:01.210> positioned<00:02:02.320> for<00:02:03.320> tip

00:02:03.580 --> 00:02:03.590 
clip comes with a positioned for tip

00:02:03.590 --> 00:02:09.969 
clip comes with a positioned for tip
down<00:02:03.860> Keri<00:02:04.340> right<00:02:04.940> side<00:02:05.300> and<00:02:08.500> it<00:02:09.500> can<00:02:09.800> be

00:02:09.969 --> 00:02:09.979 
down Keri right side and it can be

00:02:09.979 --> 00:02:12.699 
down Keri right side and it can be
reversed<00:02:10.660> it<00:02:11.660> appears<00:02:12.110> because<00:02:12.260> there's<00:02:12.530> to

00:02:12.699 --> 00:02:12.709 
reversed it appears because there's to

00:02:12.709 --> 00:02:14.440 
reversed it appears because there's to
see<00:02:13.010> those<00:02:13.190> two<00:02:13.370> holes<00:02:13.610> right<00:02:13.849> there<00:02:14.150> so<00:02:14.390> I

00:02:14.440 --> 00:02:14.450 
see those two holes right there so I

00:02:14.450 --> 00:02:18.130 
see those two holes right there so I
think<00:02:14.690> it<00:02:14.780> can<00:02:14.930> be<00:02:14.959> reversed<00:02:15.890> to<00:02:16.670> tip<00:02:16.970> up<00:02:17.209> or

00:02:18.130 --> 00:02:18.140 
think it can be reversed to tip up or

00:02:18.140 --> 00:02:21.610 
think it can be reversed to tip up or
tip<00:02:18.500> down<00:02:18.769> right<00:02:19.129> side<00:02:19.400> carry<00:02:20.140> but<00:02:21.140> no<00:02:21.290> left

00:02:21.610 --> 00:02:21.620 
tip down right side carry but no left

00:02:21.620 --> 00:02:24.780 
tip down right side carry but no left
side

00:02:24.780 --> 00:02:24.790 

00:02:24.790 --> 00:02:28.380 

it<00:02:24.909> is<00:02:25.450> a<00:02:25.689> little<00:02:25.989> difficult<00:02:26.400> to<00:02:27.400> open<00:02:27.610> it

00:02:28.380 --> 00:02:28.390 
it is a little difficult to open it

00:02:28.390 --> 00:02:30.750 
it is a little difficult to open it
doesn't<00:02:28.810> have<00:02:28.989> a<00:02:29.019> smooth<00:02:29.500> opening<00:02:30.129> and<00:02:30.700> I

00:02:30.750 --> 00:02:30.760 
doesn't have a smooth opening and I

00:02:30.760 --> 00:02:32.190 
doesn't have a smooth opening and I
think<00:02:31.060> that's<00:02:31.269> because<00:02:31.450> of<00:02:31.689> the<00:02:31.870> rather

00:02:32.190 --> 00:02:32.200 
think that's because of the rather

00:02:32.200 --> 00:02:35.429 
think that's because of the rather
strong<00:02:32.709> detent<00:02:33.629> all<00:02:34.629> right<00:02:34.750> and<00:02:34.870> the<00:02:34.959> detent

00:02:35.429 --> 00:02:35.439 
strong detent all right and the detent

00:02:35.439 --> 00:02:39.119 
strong detent all right and the detent
is<00:02:35.650> just<00:02:35.920> a<00:02:36.040> very<00:02:36.310> small<00:02:36.930> I<00:02:37.930> can<00:02:38.620> see<00:02:38.829> it<00:02:38.950> right

00:02:39.119 --> 00:02:39.129 
is just a very small I can see it right

00:02:39.129 --> 00:02:41.069 
is just a very small I can see it right
here<00:02:39.189> you<00:02:39.790> probably<00:02:40.060> can't<00:02:40.420> see<00:02:40.540> it<00:02:40.840> unless

00:02:41.069 --> 00:02:41.079 
here you probably can't see it unless

00:02:41.079 --> 00:02:43.949 
here you probably can't see it unless
you<00:02:41.200> look<00:02:41.500> close<00:02:41.769> up<00:02:42.040> but<00:02:42.629> basically<00:02:43.629> there's

00:02:43.949 --> 00:02:43.959 
you look close up but basically there's

00:02:43.959 --> 00:02:46.830 
you look close up but basically there's
a<00:02:44.019> small<00:02:44.319> depression<00:02:44.950> there<00:02:45.280> and<00:02:45.659> then<00:02:46.659> it

00:02:46.830 --> 00:02:46.840 
a small depression there and then it

00:02:46.840 --> 00:02:51.059 
a small depression there and then it
matches<00:02:47.230> up<00:02:47.260> with<00:02:47.590> a<00:02:47.650> small<00:02:49.859> protrusion<00:02:50.859> at

00:02:51.059 --> 00:02:51.069 
matches up with a small protrusion at

00:02:51.069 --> 00:02:55.440 
matches up with a small protrusion at
the<00:02:51.790> base<00:02:52.000> of<00:02:52.030> the<00:02:52.450> partial<00:02:53.230> tang<00:02:53.709> and<00:02:54.450> that's

00:02:55.440 --> 00:02:55.450 
the base of the partial tang and that's

00:02:55.450 --> 00:02:57.479 
the base of the partial tang and that's
to<00:02:55.659> keep<00:02:55.840> it<00:02:56.049> from<00:02:56.379> you<00:02:56.650> know<00:02:56.920> that's<00:02:57.129> to<00:02:57.280> keep

00:02:57.479 --> 00:02:57.489 
to keep it from you know that's to keep

00:02:57.489 --> 00:03:00.720 
to keep it from you know that's to keep
it<00:02:57.670> from<00:02:58.030> coming<00:02:58.329> open<00:02:58.810> in<00:02:58.930> your<00:02:59.019> pocket<00:02:59.730> so

00:03:00.720 --> 00:03:00.730 
it from coming open in your pocket so

00:03:00.730 --> 00:03:01.890 
it from coming open in your pocket so
when<00:03:00.819> you<00:03:00.939> open<00:03:00.970> it<00:03:01.269> you<00:03:01.329> just<00:03:01.599> have<00:03:01.780> to

00:03:01.890 --> 00:03:01.900 
when you open it you just have to

00:03:01.900 --> 00:03:05.159 
when you open it you just have to

wear<00:03:24.010> and<00:03:24.220> tear<00:03:24.340> near<00:03:24.939> the<00:03:25.120> bevel<00:03:25.510> right<00:03:26.409> there

00:03:28.879 --> 00:03:28.889 

00:03:28.889 --> 00:03:32.309 

the<00:03:29.889> contour<00:03:30.430> of<00:03:30.489> the<00:03:30.609> handle<00:03:31.229> even<00:03:32.229> though

00:03:32.309 --> 00:03:32.319 
the contour of the handle even though

00:03:32.319 --> 00:03:34.800 
the contour of the handle even though
it's<00:03:32.500> slim<00:03:32.979> it<00:03:33.669> does<00:03:33.909> give<00:03:34.120> you<00:03:34.239> a<00:03:34.269> good<00:03:34.479> grip

00:03:34.800 --> 00:03:34.810 
it's slim it does give you a good grip

00:03:34.810 --> 00:03:37.979 
it's slim it does give you a good grip
because<00:03:34.989> it<00:03:35.199> is<00:03:35.650> wide<00:03:36.010> the<00:03:36.790> g10<00:03:37.239> is<00:03:37.389> textured

00:03:37.979 --> 00:03:37.989 
because it is wide the g10 is textured

00:03:37.989 --> 00:03:40.050 
because it is wide the g10 is textured
it<00:03:38.229> has<00:03:38.500> what<00:03:38.769> they're<00:03:39.099> calling<00:03:39.340> these<00:03:39.579> finger

00:03:40.050 --> 00:03:40.060 
it has what they're calling these finger

00:03:40.060 --> 00:03:44.009 
it has what they're calling these finger
grooves<00:03:40.389> this<00:03:41.139> type<00:03:41.409> of<00:03:41.440> texturing<00:03:42.099> there<00:03:43.019> and

00:03:44.009 --> 00:03:44.019 
grooves this type of texturing there and

00:03:44.019 --> 00:03:46.140 
grooves this type of texturing there and
there<00:03:44.349> is<00:03:44.500> a<00:03:44.530> little<00:03:44.799> finger<00:03:45.159> choil<00:03:45.430> right

00:03:46.140 --> 00:03:46.150 
there is a little finger choil right

00:03:46.150 --> 00:03:50.699 
there is a little finger choil right
there<00:03:47.970> so<00:03:48.970> for<00:03:49.209> a<00:03:49.239> slim<00:03:49.510> handle<00:03:49.989> it<00:03:50.229> does<00:03:50.440> give

00:03:50.699 --> 00:03:50.709 
there so for a slim handle it does give

00:03:50.709 --> 00:03:54.059 
there so for a slim handle it does give
you<00:03:50.889> a<00:03:51.129> good<00:03:51.579> grip<00:03:52.000> and<00:03:52.409> this<00:03:53.409> type<00:03:53.709> of<00:03:53.739> blade

00:03:54.059 --> 00:03:54.069 
you a good grip and this type of blade

00:03:54.069 --> 00:03:55.710 
you a good grip and this type of blade
design<00:03:54.310> has<00:03:54.669> a<00:03:54.699> lot<00:03:55.000> of<00:03:55.030> cutting<00:03:55.419> power

00:03:55.710 --> 00:03:55.720 
design has a lot of cutting power

00:03:55.720 --> 00:03:58.199 
design has a lot of cutting power
because<00:03:56.079> you<00:03:56.260> see<00:03:56.500> there's<00:03:57.159> a<00:03:57.280> recurve<00:03:57.909> and

00:03:58.199 --> 00:03:58.209 
because you see there's a recurve and

00:03:58.209 --> 00:04:02.849 
because you see there's a recurve and
then<00:03:58.840> a<00:03:59.109> large<00:03:59.620> belly<00:04:00.010> to<00:04:00.519> the<00:04:00.549> knife<00:04:01.709> and<00:04:02.709> that

00:04:02.849 --> 00:04:02.859 
then a large belly to the knife and that

00:04:02.859 --> 00:04:06.599 
then a large belly to the knife and that
is<00:04:03.150> 440c<00:04:04.150> which<00:04:04.900> is<00:04:05.109> what<00:04:05.319> boker<00:04:05.889> I<00:04:06.129> think

00:04:06.599 --> 00:04:06.609 
is 440c which is what boker I think

00:04:06.609 --> 00:04:08.159 
is 440c which is what boker I think
that's<00:04:06.790> what<00:04:06.970> they<00:04:07.090> use<00:04:07.269> on<00:04:07.479> all<00:04:07.720> their<00:04:07.930> knives

00:04:08.159 --> 00:04:08.169 
that's what they use on all their knives

00:04:08.169 --> 00:04:12.839 
that's what they use on all their knives
which<00:04:09.099> is<00:04:09.310> a<00:04:09.720> more<00:04:10.720> affordable<00:04:11.849> stainless

00:04:12.839 --> 00:04:12.849

see at the base of base of the spine
there<00:04:27.159> is<00:04:27.370> some<00:04:27.990> angular<00:04:28.990> jimping<00:04:29.650> there<00:04:30.720> that

00:04:31.710 --> 00:04:31.720 
there is some angular jimping there that

00:04:31.720 --> 00:04:34.040 
there is some angular jimping there that
is<00:04:31.900> so<00:04:32.080> you<00:04:32.169> can<00:04:32.470> place<00:04:33.279> your<00:04:33.460> thumb<00:04:33.729> there

apply pressure while cutting
that's<00:04:37.880> good<00:04:40.090> and<00:04:41.090> it<00:04:41.240> is<00:04:41.420> torque<00:04:41.870> screw

00:04:42.220 --> 00:04:42.230 
that's good and it is torque screw

00:04:42.230 --> 00:04:44.620 
that's good and it is torque screw
construction<00:04:43.070> including<00:04:44.030> the<00:04:44.180> pivot<00:04:44.510> screw

that's<00:04:44.960> a<00:04:45.110> torque<00:04:45.380> screw<00:04:45.740> I<00:04:45.980> did<00:04:46.490> try<00:04:46.730> to

00:04:46.780 --> 00:04:46.790 
that's a torque screw I did try to

00:04:46.790 --> 00:04:48.790 
that's a torque screw I did try to
loosen<00:04:47.030> the<00:04:47.270> pivot<00:04:47.600> screw<00:04:47.750> to<00:04:48.140> make<00:04:48.290> it<00:04:48.440> open

loosen the pivot screw to make it open

00:04:48.800 --> 00:04:50.800 
loosen the pivot screw to make it open
smoother<00:04:49.340> but<00:04:49.490> you<00:04:49.640> can<00:04:49.790> only<00:04:49.910> loosen<00:04:50.450> it<00:04:50.570> so

00:04:50.800 --> 00:04:50.810 
smoother but you can only loosen it so

00:04:50.810 --> 00:04:52.930 
smoother but you can only loosen it so
much<00:04:51.050> before<00:04:51.290> it<00:04:51.620> starts<00:04:51.950> to<00:04:52.100> wobble<00:04:52.340> so<00:04:52.760> that

00:04:52.930 --> 00:04:52.940 
much before it starts to wobble so that

00:04:52.940 --> 00:04:55.870 
much before it starts to wobble so that
didn't<00:04:53.240> really<00:04:53.390> improve<00:04:53.870> it<00:04:54.050> very<00:04:54.260> much<00:04:54.880> but

00:04:55.870 --> 00:04:55.880 
didn't really improve it very much but

00:04:55.880 --> 00:04:59.320 
didn't really improve it very much but
overall<00:04:57.250> you<00:04:58.250> know<00:04:58.280> at<00:04:58.430> about<00:04:58.700> three<00:04:59.180> and<00:04:59.210> a

00:04:59.320 --> 00:04:59.330 
overall you know at about three and a

00:04:59.330 --> 00:05:01.750 
overall you know at about three and a
half<00:04:59.360> inches<00:04:59.780> in<00:05:00.050> blade<00:05:00.320> length<00:05:00.620> is<00:05:00.950> a<00:05:01.340> very

00:05:01.750 --> 00:05:01.760 
half inches in blade length is a very

00:05:01.760 --> 00:05:05.770 
half inches in blade length is a very
good<00:05:02.230> size<00:05:03.230> for<00:05:03.560> EDC<00:05:04.270> it's<00:05:05.270> a<00:05:05.300> little<00:05:05.600> heavy

00:05:05.770 --> 00:05:05.780 
good size for EDC it's a little heavy

00:05:05.780 --> 00:05:08.170 
good size for EDC it's a little heavy
but<00:05:05.930> that<00:05:06.200> doesn't<00:05:06.530> always<00:05:06.710> matter<00:05:07.040> you<00:05:08.000> would

00:05:08.170 --> 00:05:08.180 
but that doesn't always matter you would

00:05:08.180 --> 00:05:10.120 
but that doesn't always matter you would
carry<00:05:08.630> this<00:05:08.810> if<00:05:09.020> you<00:05:09.140> want<00:05:09.380> a<00:05:09.500> lot<00:05:09.740> of<00:05:09.890> cutting

00:05:10.120 --> 00:05:10.130 
carry this if you want a lot of cutting

00:05:10.130 --> 00:05:12.610 
carry this if you want a lot of cutting
power<00:05:10.460> because<00:05:11.030> the<00:05:11.480> blade<00:05:11.750> is<00:05:11.930> extra<00:05:12.410> wide

00:05:12.610 --> 00:05:12.620 
power because the blade is extra wide

00:05:12.620 --> 00:05:15.730 
power because the blade is extra wide
for<00:05:13.280> its<00:05:13.460> length<00:05:13.820> and<00:05:14.150> it's<00:05:14.690> fairly<00:05:14.900> strong<00:05:15.440> to

00:05:15.730 --> 00:05:15.740 
for its length and it's fairly strong to

00:05:15.740 --> 00:05:18.280 
for its length and it's fairly strong to

material here than a clip point and the

00:05:21.110 --> 00:05:24.100 
material here than a clip point and the
bevel<00:05:21.940> again<00:05:22.940> just<00:05:23.180> more<00:05:23.420> material<00:05:23.960> that's

00:05:24.100 --> 00:05:24.110 
bevel again just more material that's

00:05:24.110 --> 00:05:26.380 
bevel again just more material that's
why<00:05:24.320> it's<00:05:24.500> kind<00:05:24.740> of<00:05:24.830> heavy<00:05:24.980> but<00:05:25.670> that<00:05:26.060> makes<00:05:26.240> it

00:05:26.380 --> 00:05:26.390 
why it's kind of heavy but that makes it

00:05:26.390 --> 00:05:28.900 
why it's kind of heavy but that makes it
pretty<00:05:26.630> durable<00:05:27.110> and<00:05:27.560> the<00:05:28.190> frame<00:05:28.460> lock<00:05:28.670> is

00:05:28.900 --> 00:05:28.910 
pretty durable and the frame lock is

00:05:28.910 --> 00:05:30.790 
pretty durable and the frame lock is
nice<00:05:29.210> because<00:05:29.510> it's<00:05:29.810> very<00:05:29.930> secure<00:05:30.440> it's<00:05:30.620> not

00:05:30.790 --> 00:05:30.800 
nice because it's very secure it's not

00:05:30.800 --> 00:05:32.380 
nice because it's very secure it's not
going<00:05:31.070> to<00:05:31.190> be<00:05:31.310> disengaged<00:05:31.730> when<00:05:32.270> you're

00:05:32.380 --> 00:05:32.390 
going to be disengaged when you're

00:05:32.390 --> 00:05:34.150 
going to be disengaged when you're
squeezing<00:05:32.900> the<00:05:33.020> frame<00:05:33.290> like<00:05:33.530> that<00:05:33.770> which<00:05:34.010> you

00:05:34.150 --> 00:05:34.160 
squeezing the frame like that which you

00:05:34.160 --> 00:05:37.210 
squeezing the frame like that which you
would<00:05:34.400> do<00:05:35.090> in<00:05:35.360> normal<00:05:35.810> use<00:05:36.080> and<00:05:36.290> it<00:05:36.860> makes<00:05:37.040> it

00:05:37.210 --> 00:05:37.220 
would do in normal use and it makes it

00:05:37.220 --> 00:05:39.610 
would do in normal use and it makes it
slimmer<00:05:37.670> so<00:05:38.060> a<00:05:38.300> little<00:05:38.840> heavy<00:05:39.110> but<00:05:39.230> at<00:05:39.470> least

00:05:39.610 --> 00:05:39.620 
slimmer so a little heavy but at least

00:05:39.620 --> 00:05:42.010 
slimmer so a little heavy but at least
it<00:05:39.860> is<00:05:40.010> slim<00:05:40.370> and<00:05:40.640> you<00:05:41.030> get<00:05:41.240> a<00:05:41.270> lot<00:05:41.540> of<00:05:41.570> cutting

00:05:42.010 --> 00:05:42.020 
it is slim and you get a lot of cutting

00:05:42.020 --> 00:05:46.470 
it is slim and you get a lot of cutting
power<00:05:42.380> ok<00:05:43.250> for<00:05:43.310> that<00:05:43.850> weight<00:05:44.740> the<00:05:45.740> draw<00:05:46.070> cuts

00:05:46.470 --> 00:05:46.480 
power ok for that weight the draw cuts

00:05:46.480 --> 00:05:49.030 
power ok for that weight the draw cuts
you<00:05:47.480> know<00:05:47.600> putting<00:05:48.080> something<00:05:48.380> here<00:05:48.770> and<00:05:48.919> then

00:05:49.030 --> 00:05:49.040 
you know putting something here and then

00:05:49.040 --> 00:05:52.360 
you know putting something here and then
drawing<00:05:49.340> the<00:05:49.700> belly<00:05:49.880> through<00:05:50.390> a<00:05:51.160> lot<00:05:52.160> of

00:05:52.360 --> 00:05:52.370 
drawing the belly through a lot of

00:05:52.370 --> 00:05:55.840 
drawing the belly through a lot of
cutting<00:05:52.610> power<00:05:53.260> for<00:05:54.260> its<00:05:54.290> size<00:05:54.710> it<00:05:55.520> would<00:05:55.669> be

00:05:55.840 --> 00:05:55.850 
cutting power for its size it would be

00:05:55.850 --> 00:05:58.030 
cutting power for its size it would be
good<00:05:56.000> for<00:05:56.060> EDC<00:05:56.690> if<00:05:57.140> you<00:05:57.260> have<00:05:57.380> a<00:05:57.410> lot<00:05:57.680> of<00:05:57.710> heavy

00:05:58.030 --> 00:05:58.040 
good for EDC if you have a lot of heavy

00:05:58.040 --> 00:06:02.530 
good for EDC if you have a lot of heavy
work<00:05:58.400> tasks<00:06:00.280> it's<00:06:01.280> not<00:06:01.460> very<00:06:01.730> pointed<00:06:02.330> for

00:06:02.530 --> 00:06:02.540 
work tasks it's not very pointed for

00:06:02.540 --> 00:06:04.450 
work tasks it's not very pointed for
penetration<00:06:03.050> if<00:06:03.320> that's<00:06:03.530> a<00:06:03.680> concern<00:06:04.040> so<00:06:04.310> it's

00:06:04.450 --> 00:06:04.460 
penetration if that's a concern so it's

00:06:04.460 --> 00:06:06.100 
penetration if that's a concern so it's
definitely<00:06:05.000> not<00:06:05.360> you<00:06:05.720> know<00:06:05.840> it's<00:06:05.990> definitely

00:06:06.100 --> 00:06:06.110 
definitely not you know it's definitely

00:06:06.110 --> 00:06:09.610 
definitely not you know it's definitely
not<00:06:06.620> a<00:06:06.680> folding<00:06:07.220> dagger<00:06:07.490> at<00:06:07.820> all<00:06:07.970> it's<00:06:08.300> a<00:06:08.780> more

00:06:09.610 --> 00:06:09.620 
not a folding dagger at all it's a more

00:06:09.620 --> 00:06:11.890 
not a folding dagger at all it's a more
of<00:06:09.710> a<00:06:09.800> slasher<00:06:10.340> a<00:06:10.370> chopper<00:06:10.910> or<00:06:11.030> a<00:06:11.120> close<00:06:11.480> cutter

00:06:11.890 --> 00:06:11.900 
of a slasher a chopper or a close cutter

00:06:11.900 --> 00:06:17.370 
of a slasher a chopper or a close cutter
and<00:06:13.810> you<00:06:14.810> know<00:06:14.930> this<00:06:15.080> is<00:06:15.110> kind<00:06:15.500> of<00:06:15.650> the<00:06:16.610> larger

00:06:17.370 --> 00:06:17.380 
and you know this is kind of the larger

00:06:17.380 --> 00:06:19.960 
and you know this is kind of the larger
the<00:06:18.380> big<00:06:18.560> brother<00:06:18.890> of<00:06:19.100> the<00:06:19.220> bokor<00:06:19.640> trance

00:06:19.960 --> 00:06:19.970 
the big brother of the bokor trance

00:06:19.970 --> 00:06:22.750 
the big brother of the bokor trance
which<00:06:20.600> is<00:06:20.840> kind<00:06:21.290> of<00:06:21.410> like<00:06:21.500> their<00:06:21.770> extra<00:06:22.430> small

00:06:22.750 --> 00:06:22.760 
which is kind of like their extra small

00:06:22.760 --> 00:06:25.150 
which is kind of like their extra small
EDC<00:06:23.360> and<00:06:23.570> this<00:06:23.660> would<00:06:23.840> be<00:06:23.870> there<00:06:24.290> I<00:06:24.560> guess

00:06:25.150 --> 00:06:25.160 
EDC and this would be there I guess

00:06:25.160 --> 00:06:28.540 
EDC and this would be there I guess
medium<00:06:25.669> sized<00:06:26.260> EDC<00:06:27.260> offering<00:06:27.710> forty<00:06:28.130> dollars

00:06:28.540 --> 00:06:28.550 
medium sized EDC offering forty dollars

00:06:28.550 --> 00:06:30.760 
medium sized EDC offering forty dollars
is<00:06:28.730> a<00:06:28.760> moderate<00:06:29.270> price<00:06:29.540> so<00:06:30.169> all<00:06:30.410> in<00:06:30.620> all<00:06:30.710> pretty

00:06:30.760 --> 00:06:30.770 
is a moderate price so all in all pretty

00:06:30.770 --> 00:06:32.560 
is a moderate price so all in all pretty
good<00:06:31.100> it<00:06:31.400> just<00:06:31.490> depends<00:06:32.000> what<00:06:32.180> you<00:06:32.270> want<00:06:32.480> to

00:06:32.560 --> 00:06:32.570 
good it just depends what you want to

00:06:32.570 --> 00:06:35.050 
good it just depends what you want to
use<00:06:32.750> it<00:06:32.780> for<00:06:32.950> the<00:06:33.950> only<00:06:34.190> hits<00:06:34.430> against<00:06:34.910> it

00:06:35.050 --> 00:06:35.060 
use it for the only hits against it

00:06:35.060 --> 00:06:37.900 
use it for the only hits against it
would<00:06:35.660> be<00:06:35.720> the<00:06:36.200> opening<00:06:37.130> not<00:06:37.370> being<00:06:37.669> very

00:06:37.900 --> 00:06:37.910 
would be the opening not being very

00:06:37.910 --> 00:06:42.450 
would be the opening not being very
smooth<00:06:38.360> and<00:06:39.490> some<00:06:40.490> people<00:06:40.790> don't<00:06:41.030> like<00:06:41.230> 440c

00:06:42.450 --> 00:06:42.460 
smooth and some people don't like 440c

00:06:42.460 --> 00:06:45.310 
smooth and some people don't like 440c
so<00:06:43.460> all<00:06:43.640> in<00:06:43.790> all<00:06:43.910> the<00:06:44.360> bokor<00:06:44.660> m-type<00:06:45.020> it's<00:06:45.229> a

00:06:45.310 --> 00:06:45.320 
so all in all the bokor m-type it's a

00:06:45.320 --> 00:06:46.659 
so all in all the bokor m-type it's a
pretty<00:06:45.560> good<00:06:45.860> value<00:06:46.250> it's<00:06:46.370> kind<00:06:46.580> of

00:06:46.659 --> 00:06:46.669 
pretty good value it's kind of

00:06:46.669 --> 00:06:48.430 
pretty good value it's kind of
