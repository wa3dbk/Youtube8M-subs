00:05:09.050 --> 00:05:09.060 
that they had the lead on us the whole

00:05:09.060 --> 00:05:10.730 
that they had the lead on us the whole

time I thought I put us back in the lead

00:05:10.740 --> 00:05:11.570 
time I thought I put us back in the lead
right<00:05:10.919> there<00:05:11.130> I<00:05:11.160> missed<00:05:11.370> a<00:05:11.430> couple

00:05:11.570 --> 00:05:11.580 
right there I missed a couple

00:05:11.580 --> 00:05:13.220 
right there I missed a couple
opportunities<00:05:11.850> for<00:05:12.419> killstreaks<00:05:12.840> at<00:05:12.960> the<00:05:13.080> end

00:05:13.220 --> 00:05:13.230 
opportunities for killstreaks at the end

00:05:13.230 --> 00:05:15.110 
opportunities for killstreaks at the end
so<00:05:13.680> I<00:05:13.710> felt<00:05:13.980> like<00:05:14.070> I<00:05:14.190> let<00:05:14.340> down<00:05:14.520> the<00:05:14.640> team<00:05:14.790> even

00:05:15.110 --> 00:05:15.120
