00:00:09.950 --> 00:00:13.080
 hello i hope you're fine 

00:00:11.730 --> 00:00:14.429
 today is a video a bit 

00:00:13.080 --> 00:00:15.809
 different I lent my time that a 

00:00:14.429 --> 00:00:17.369
 subscriber a month coming who joined me 

00:00:15.809 --> 00:00:18.690
 in the assignment of bad players so 

00:00:17.369 --> 00:00:21.330
 I lent him my time or simply 

00:00:18.690 --> 00:00:23.160
 I order them and order and I 

00:00:21.330 --> 00:00:25.050
 made a small gift for him to make 

00:00:23.160 --> 00:00:26.609
 a little trick for them to test this 

00:00:25.050 --> 00:00:28.109
 kind of little things so I keep a 

00:00:26.609 --> 00:00:31.050
 little bit of distance from 

00:00:28.109 --> 00:00:33.059
 him for not the penalized by 

00:00:31.050 --> 00:00:34.500
 compared to what will surround him and in 

00:00:33.059 --> 00:00:35.730
 same time and that's not that I'm lining up 

00:00:34.500 --> 00:00:36.780
 me that's what's great is that 

00:00:35.730 --> 00:00:38.040
 sometimes I like it like that 

00:00:36.780 --> 00:00:39.480
 the unannounced film and I do not take the 

00:00:38.040 --> 00:00:40.739
 head is if I want to film I 

00:00:39.480 --> 00:00:43.379
 shit even if I do not want I have not 

00:00:40.739 --> 00:00:44.760
 necessarily the time when we have never 

00:00:43.379 --> 00:00:45.750
 not want to film everything and anything 

00:00:44.760 --> 00:00:47.250
 what not there I just wanted 

00:00:45.750 --> 00:00:49.410
 see how he's doing and so much 

00:00:47.250 --> 00:00:50.700
 of names that is not especially that he is 

00:00:49.410 --> 00:00:51.920
 filmed and so I do not know how he 

00:00:50.700 --> 00:00:54.180
 will get by in this part 

00:00:51.920 --> 00:00:55.260
 and you have to know that the parts that 

00:00:54.180 --> 00:00:56.670
 subscribers it's not that I do not want 

00:00:55.260 --> 00:00:58.440
 to go do that it's a lot of 

00:00:56.670 --> 00:01:00.390
 settings it takes a lot of time 

00:00:58.440 --> 00:01:01.620
 so for those who would like to know the 

00:01:00.390 --> 00:01:02.670
 time so it's already taking its wildlife 

00:01:01.620 --> 00:01:04.830
 minimum three hours for everything 

00:01:02.670 --> 00:01:06.360
 set correctly and I do not have 

00:01:04.830 --> 00:01:07.890
 necessarily want to take my head 

00:01:06.360 --> 00:01:09.119
 and knowing that now I can more 

00:01:07.890 --> 00:01:10.740
 pleasure to people why because I have 

00:01:09.119 --> 00:01:12.299
 found making videos with 

00:01:10.740 --> 00:01:14.700
 subscribers it's good it's cool 

00:01:12.299 --> 00:01:16.320
 nice they are happy and the day you 

00:01:14.700 --> 00:01:17.820
 can pass other earache subscribers who 

00:01:16.320 --> 00:01:19.290
 want to redo and redo videos 

00:01:17.820 --> 00:01:20.640
 with you or I do not know what and you 

00:01:19.290 --> 00:01:23.430
 can not technically pass 

00:01:20.640 --> 00:01:24.990
 22000 people still Thursday 22 mills and 

00:01:23.430 --> 00:01:26.640
 26000 people you can not play that 

00:01:24.990 --> 00:01:27.930
 everyone I'm sorry so after 

00:01:26.640 --> 00:01:31.079
 must understand must be a little bit 

00:01:27.930 --> 00:01:33.390
 logic we can not do 26000 gameplay 

00:01:31.079 --> 00:01:35.340
 with everyone and that it room 

00:01:33.390 --> 00:01:36.990
 asks a lot of time so after he 

00:01:35.340 --> 00:01:37.920
 there are also connection problems 

00:01:36.990 --> 00:01:40.229
 that is, the time we spend 

00:01:37.920 --> 00:01:41.790
 so join me that my handicap of 

00:01:40.229 --> 00:01:42.960
 lose two three hours each time 

00:01:41.790 --> 00:01:43.770
 to wait for the people who are 

00:01:42.960 --> 00:01:45.720
 connect or do not arrive at 

00:01:43.770 --> 00:01:47.549
 join the session and after there is the 

00:01:45.720 --> 00:01:48.930
 shift with the sound after times there 

00:01:47.549 --> 00:01:50.310
 there are microphones that do not pass and that's 

00:01:48.930 --> 00:01:52.259
 so it's really a lot of confidence 

00:01:50.310 --> 00:01:53.670
 it's not like that to the snatch mona 

00:01:52.259 --> 00:01:55.320
 he thinks that's it you're relying on 

00:01:53.670 --> 00:01:56.729
 a play button that you play and that's it 

00:01:55.320 --> 00:01:58.770
 it does not work like that the gains 

00:01:56.729 --> 00:02:00.329
 many think it's your fairest 

00:01:58.770 --> 00:02:02.100
 without button save and his life you 

00:02:00.329 --> 00:02:03.570
 speak and that the talking guy is a 

00:02:02.100 --> 00:02:04.560
 sick the gameplay like that if it was 

00:02:03.570 --> 00:02:06.030
 as easy 

00:02:04.560 --> 00:02:08.039
 at the moment I am loaning 25000 

00:02:06.030 --> 00:02:09.630
 gameplay a day but it's a lot 

00:02:08.039 --> 00:02:11.640
 more complex to achieve so it asks 

00:02:09.630 --> 00:02:13.050
 a lot of time that's why 

00:02:11.640 --> 00:02:15.300
 I decided not to really do 

00:02:13.050 --> 00:02:16.410
 videos and subscribers so I 

00:02:15.300 --> 00:02:18.540
 would very rarely 

00:02:16.410 --> 00:02:20.580
 if of course the opportunity arises 6 g 

00:02:18.540 --> 00:02:21.989
 if I have the time it is that time 

00:02:20.580 --> 00:02:23.340
 lack that's what people do not arrive 

00:02:21.989 --> 00:02:24.630
 not understand is that already I 

00:02:23.340 --> 00:02:28.110
 purpose really to do a lot of 

00:02:24.630 --> 00:02:30.930
 gameplay for for to do a lot 

00:02:28.110 --> 00:02:33.300
 of things and people necessarily 

00:02:30.930 --> 00:02:36.030
 forget that a human is hiding behind 

00:02:33.300 --> 00:02:37.049
 every video is not a machine it's 

00:02:36.030 --> 00:02:38.430
 not someone who is there just for 

00:02:37.049 --> 00:02:40.290
 make videos and closes his mouth 

00:02:38.430 --> 00:02:41.549
 so that's why I'll draw from 

00:02:40.290 --> 00:02:42.660
 do as I see fit 

00:02:41.549 --> 00:02:44.010
 so after that it's not a chain 

00:02:42.660 --> 00:02:45.959
 community my chain so of course 

00:02:44.010 --> 00:02:47.819
 for those who know cold so it's 

00:02:45.959 --> 00:02:50.280
 a chain of one of a normal person 

00:02:47.819 --> 00:02:52.319
 who makes these videos to entertain already 

00:02:50.280 --> 00:02:54.090
 his passion already and share it as the 

00:02:52.319 --> 00:02:55.319
 others it's not the fact that it's there 

00:02:54.090 --> 00:02:56.910
 I made three four videos that have 

00:02:55.319 --> 00:02:58.799
 does for example 15 min 20 million 

00:02:56.910 --> 00:03:00.180
 subscribers I have more than anything from 

00:02:58.799 --> 00:03:01.080
 automatically I'll do it again 

00:03:00.180 --> 00:03:02.519
 to make you happy 

00:03:01.080 --> 00:03:03.450
 if I have time I will do it I said 

00:03:02.519 --> 00:03:04.890
 no time i will not do i have 

00:03:03.450 --> 00:03:06.330
 a lot of videos waiting or 

00:03:04.890 --> 00:03:07.380
 others that led to 

00:03:06.330 --> 00:03:08.430
 videos it's been two months since they 

00:03:07.380 --> 00:03:10.590
 wait so I forgot about them 

00:03:08.430 --> 00:03:12.480
 to be able to present their contents 

00:03:10.590 --> 00:03:14.239
 have been waiting for two months we see these 

00:03:12.480 --> 00:03:16.140
 questions it's a matter of logic 

00:03:14.239 --> 00:03:17.340
 hong lei doing the toy 

00:03:16.140 --> 00:03:19.530
 with his time and that makes me super 

00:03:17.340 --> 00:03:20.760
 swamp located frankly and I him 

00:03:19.530 --> 00:03:22.350
 pass the most expensive but my point which 

00:03:20.760 --> 00:03:23.640
 labi me but he's still mean 

00:03:22.350 --> 00:03:27.000
 look, I have the impression that 

00:03:23.640 --> 00:03:28.170
 I have really lost its purpose is 

00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:29.910
 simply drop it off 

00:03:28.170 --> 00:03:31.319
 post so it's still funny 

00:03:29.910 --> 00:03:32.400
 take people on the go who know 

00:03:31.319 --> 00:03:34.560
 not that you film them so I tell him 

00:03:32.400 --> 00:03:36.090
 take the time he is yours is this 

00:03:34.560 --> 00:03:37.950
 you want to make a big carnage 

00:03:36.090 --> 00:03:38.650
 so I'm having fun at the 

00:03:37.950 --> 00:03:41.290
 to follow 

00:03:38.650 --> 00:03:42.849
 by far - as follows very closely 

00:03:41.290 --> 00:03:44.769
 bother me because after I do not know 

00:03:42.849 --> 00:03:46.000
 if it's the enemy or not wait until the 

00:03:44.769 --> 00:03:47.260
 police know you a little bit more 

00:03:46.000 --> 00:03:49.239
 high q what happens all 

00:03:47.260 --> 00:03:50.980
 it just really sticks to you 

00:03:49.239 --> 00:03:52.329
 if you do not move away very quickly 

00:03:50.980 --> 00:03:54.489
 the danger that awaits you 

00:03:52.329 --> 00:03:55.840
 you are quickly neutralized by the 

00:03:54.489 --> 00:03:57.250
 police and for that I prefer to keep united 

00:03:55.840 --> 00:03:59.709
 this time a reasonable distance by 

00:03:57.250 --> 00:04:01.000
 report to him so if I have the opportunity 

00:03:59.709 --> 00:04:02.290
 who presents himself to do this kind of 

00:04:01.000 --> 00:04:05.109
 gameplay and I would do it if I did not 

00:04:02.290 --> 00:04:07.629
 the occasion bah sorry but that's it 

00:04:05.109 --> 00:04:11.349
 it 's timeframe bridges that I have 

00:04:07.629 --> 00:04:13.180
 who will fall these people anyway from 

00:04:11.349 --> 00:04:15.340
 justify each time so that the 

00:04:13.180 --> 00:04:16.989
 people come to think that we 

00:04:15.340 --> 00:04:18.850
 is not necessarily that offers a menu 

00:04:16.989 --> 00:04:19.870
 once there is a subscriber who made me 

00:04:18.850 --> 00:04:21.760
 a reflection he told me yeah that's 

00:04:19.870 --> 00:04:23.050
 easy to make parties and that the 

00:04:21.760 --> 00:04:24.190
 subscribers he gets to do it 

00:04:23.050 --> 00:04:26.020
 is good but unless it does by 

00:04:24.190 --> 00:04:27.070
 as many videos as me and I think 

00:04:26.020 --> 00:04:29.260
 we do not have the same chain itself 

00:04:27.070 --> 00:04:32.949
 public so after we do not necessarily 

00:04:29.260 --> 00:04:34.449
 the same the same things to propose and 

00:04:32.949 --> 00:04:36.970
 maybe he does it for his pleasure 

00:04:34.449 --> 00:04:38.080
 I do this juni of a level we go 

00:04:36.970 --> 00:04:39.340
 say a little older professionals 

00:04:38.080 --> 00:04:40.690
 could propose a gameplay where there is 

00:04:39.340 --> 00:04:43.960
 shit ie help 

00:04:40.690 --> 00:04:45.669
 pixelation of people who shout kindle 

00:04:43.960 --> 00:04:46.810
 who there are dogs that bark 

00:04:45.669 --> 00:04:48.039
 lately it does not interest me 

00:04:46.810 --> 00:04:50.770
 looking for something clean 

00:04:48.039 --> 00:04:52.900
 for the aesthetics of visual eyes and 

00:04:50.770 --> 00:04:55.690
 hearing is not for you either 

00:04:52.900 --> 00:04:57.729
 but weird noises or dice 

00:04:55.690 --> 00:04:58.479
 that's what to do with quality 

00:04:57.729 --> 00:04:59.830
 quite simply 

00:04:58.479 --> 00:05:01.419
 so it takes time to do some 

00:04:59.830 --> 00:05:03.370
 quality make shit what does it take 

00:05:01.419 --> 00:05:04.449
 that France has that 5 6 minutes you support 

00:05:03.370 --> 00:05:06.159
 on the power button that's it 

00:05:04.449 --> 00:05:07.389
 registered after I criticize nobody 

00:05:06.159 --> 00:05:09.250
 since it does not necessarily have that they do not have 

00:05:07.389 --> 00:05:10.790
 necessarily the means to record 

00:05:09.250 --> 00:05:12.530
 gameplay 

00:05:10.790 --> 00:05:15.230
 it's expensive to invest in 

00:05:12.530 --> 00:05:17.330
 material it costs quite a bit of time 

00:05:15.230 --> 00:05:18.830
 perfection me I am someone very 

00:05:17.330 --> 00:05:21.350
 perfectionist ie I do not like 

00:05:18.830 --> 00:05:21.620
 not doing things goes to the gonna 

00:05:21.350 --> 00:05:22.940
 quick 

00:05:21.620 --> 00:05:24.680
 I like doing the thing very square 

00:05:22.940 --> 00:05:25.550
 by the way if I do a gameplay I 

00:05:24.680 --> 00:05:27.860
 do from a to z 

00:05:25.550 --> 00:05:29.920
 if until now we would not do it 

00:05:27.860 --> 00:05:31.670
 logical I did not agree 

00:05:29.920 --> 00:05:32.660
 now after people who are a 

00:05:31.670 --> 00:05:33.080
 a little less careful of their 

00:05:32.660 --> 00:05:34.820
 job 

00:05:33.080 --> 00:05:36.260
 it's their problem - 

00:05:34.820 --> 00:05:37.850
 I did what I told you I know 

00:05:36.260 --> 00:05:39.290
 I am motivated I am passionate about this 

00:05:37.850 --> 00:05:41.240
 that I do I take a malicious pleasure 

00:05:39.290 --> 00:05:42.860
 to make videos you see the evidence 

00:05:41.240 --> 00:05:43.880
 is that for those who will say yeah 

00:05:42.860 --> 00:05:45.020
 you take pleasure in falling 

00:05:43.880 --> 00:05:46.610
 a lot now that we have passion 

00:05:45.020 --> 00:05:47.900
 I just do not even have time for 

00:05:46.610 --> 00:05:49.790
 tell you to put videos I loved 

00:05:47.900 --> 00:05:51.560
 even at 3 in the morning so I do not 

00:05:49.790 --> 00:05:55.160
 do not even look for buzz there are 

00:05:51.560 --> 00:05:57.020
 youtuber it puts at 16h 17h and who waits 

00:05:55.160 --> 00:05:59.240
 3 4 days it makes views and after 

00:05:57.020 --> 00:06:01.850
 they put a video from behind and 

00:05:59.240 --> 00:06:03.650
