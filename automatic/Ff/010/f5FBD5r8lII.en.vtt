00:00:11.049 --> 00:00:11.059 
they could see that but that and then

00:00:11.059 --> 00:00:12.580 
they could see that but that and then
that<00:00:11.210> that<00:00:11.450> one<00:00:11.600> over<00:00:11.809> here<00:00:11.990> is<00:00:12.080> bracketed<00:00:12.410> in

00:00:12.580 --> 00:00:12.590 
that that one over here is bracketed in

00:00:12.590 --> 00:00:14.529 
that that one over here is bracketed in
white<00:00:12.799> and<00:00:13.580> then<00:00:13.699> there's<00:00:13.850> some<00:00:13.969> enemy<00:00:14.270> planes

00:00:14.529 --> 00:00:14.539 
white and then there's some enemy planes

00:00:14.539 --> 00:00:16.779 
white and then there's some enemy planes
are<00:00:14.719> coming<00:00:15.020> in<00:00:15.110> but<00:00:15.830> look<00:00:16.250> when<00:00:16.400> I<00:00:16.460> shoot<00:00:16.699> the

are coming in but look when I shoot the
water<00:00:17.000> you<00:00:17.150> can<00:00:17.270> see<00:00:17.390> that<00:00:17.539> water<00:00:17.779> effect<00:00:20.410> so

00:00:21.400 --> 00:00:21.410 
water you can see that water effect so

00:00:21.410 --> 00:00:22.990 
water you can see that water effect so
first<00:00:21.740> thing<00:00:21.860> I'll<00:00:21.980> do<00:00:22.130> is<00:00:22.490> I'll<00:00:22.640> jump<00:00:22.850> into

00:00:22.990 --> 00:00:23.000 
first thing I'll do is I'll jump into

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:25.870 
first thing I'll do is I'll jump into
campaign<00:00:23.510> mode<00:00:23.750> and<00:00:24.500> once<00:00:24.650> that's<00:00:24.860> up<00:00:25.070> I<00:00:25.340> want

00:00:25.870 --> 00:00:25.880 
campaign mode and once that's up I want

00:00:25.880 --> 00:00:29.830 
campaign mode and once that's up I want
to<00:00:25.970> scan<00:00:26.180> in<00:00:26.360> my<00:00:26.510> plane<00:00:27.340> so<00:00:28.510> what<00:00:29.510> I've<00:00:29.630> done<00:00:29.780> is

00:00:29.830 --> 00:00:29.840 
to scan in my plane so what I've done is

00:00:29.840 --> 00:00:32.319 
to scan in my plane so what I've done is
I've<00:00:30.110> scanned<00:00:30.410> in<00:00:30.620> the<00:00:30.980> wing<00:00:31.160> on<00:00:31.940> the<00:00:32.000> plane

00:00:32.319 --> 00:00:32.329 
I've scanned in the wing on the plane

00:00:32.329 --> 00:00:35.049 
I've scanned in the wing on the plane
the<00:00:32.930> image<00:00:33.170> recognition<00:00:33.350> lets<00:00:34.010> be<00:00:34.219> unlocked

00:00:35.049 --> 00:00:35.059 
the image recognition lets be unlocked

00:00:35.059 --> 00:00:37.390 
the image recognition lets be unlocked
with<00:00:35.420> the<00:00:35.510> Corsairs<00:00:35.960> missions<00:00:36.350> so<00:00:36.890> now<00:00:36.980> each

00:00:37.390 --> 00:00:37.400 
with the Corsairs missions so now each

00:00:37.400 --> 00:00:40.000 
with the Corsairs missions so now each
plane<00:00:37.790> has<00:00:38.000> its<00:00:38.180> own<00:00:38.300> set<00:00:38.480> of<00:00:38.510> 16<00:00:38.930> missions<00:00:39.290> and

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:40.010 
plane has its own set of 16 missions and

00:00:40.010 --> 00:00:41.800 
plane has its own set of 16 missions and
those<00:00:40.130> 16<00:00:40.489> missions<00:00:40.820> are<00:00:41.090> all<00:00:41.300> specific<00:00:41.510> to

00:00:41.800 --> 00:00:41.810 
those 16 missions are all specific to

00:00:41.810 --> 00:00:44.020 
those 16 missions are all specific to
that<00:00:42.020> plane<00:00:42.340> so<00:00:43.340> the<00:00:43.579> next<00:00:43.730> thing<00:00:43.850> I'm<00:00:43.940> gonna

00:00:44.020 --> 00:00:44.030 
that plane so the next thing I'm gonna

00:00:44.030 --> 00:00:45.069 
that plane so the next thing I'm gonna
do<00:00:44.149> is<00:00:44.239> you've<00:00:44.480> got<00:00:44.510> a<00:00:44.660> little<00:00:44.870> stencil

00:00:45.069 --> 00:00:45.079 
do is you've got a little stencil

gonna get it real good I had let's find
something<00:01:17.220> that<00:01:17.370> enemy<00:01:17.700> planes<00:01:17.940> to<00:01:18.120> shoot

00:01:18.290 --> 00:01:18.300 
something that enemy planes to shoot

down

00:01:18.590 --> 00:01:18.600 
down

00:01:18.600 --> 00:01:20.840 
down
that's<00:01:18.720> that'll<00:01:19.080> be<00:01:19.140> more<00:01:19.260> fun<00:01:19.670> when<00:01:20.670> we're

that's that'll be more fun when we're

00:01:20.850 --> 00:01:23.180 
that's that'll be more fun when we're
done<00:01:21.030> when<00:01:21.600> we're<00:01:21.750> done<00:01:21.900> in<00:01:22.560> our<00:01:22.770> in<00:01:23.070> our

done when we're done in our in our
office<00:01:24.000> cubicle<00:01:24.540> or<00:01:24.840> living<00:01:25.200> room<00:01:25.350> where

00:01:25.520 --> 00:01:25.530 
office cubicle or living room where

00:01:25.530 --> 00:01:28.190 
office cubicle or living room where
we're<00:01:25.710> playing<00:01:26.040> there<00:01:26.730> is<00:01:27.150> a<00:01:27.540> portal<00:01:28.020> here

00:01:28.190 --> 00:01:28.200 
we're playing there is a portal here

00:01:28.200 --> 00:01:31.310 
we're playing there is a portal here
that<00:01:28.380> gonna<00:01:28.560> find<00:01:28.830> the<00:01:28.920> portal<00:01:29.960> I'm<00:01:30.960> gonna<00:01:31.140> fly

00:01:31.310 --> 00:01:31.320 
that gonna find the portal I'm gonna fly

00:01:31.320 --> 00:01:33.950 
that gonna find the portal I'm gonna fly
through<00:01:31.530> this<00:01:31.620> cloud<00:01:31.890> bank<00:01:32.190> and<00:01:32.490> when<00:01:33.390> I<00:01:33.420> pop

00:01:33.950 --> 00:01:33.960 
through this cloud bank and when I pop

00:01:33.960 --> 00:01:35.300 
through this cloud bank and when I pop
out<00:01:34.140> on<00:01:34.170> the<00:01:34.350> other<00:01:34.440> side<00:01:34.680> of<00:01:34.710> the<00:01:34.830> cloud<00:01:35.010> bank

00:01:35.300 --> 00:01:35.310 
out on the other side of the cloud bank

00:01:35.310 --> 00:01:38.690 
out on the other side of the cloud bank
now<00:01:36.090> when<00:01:36.300> I<00:01:36.330> popped<00:01:36.720> out<00:01:36.930> there's<00:01:37.260> my<00:01:37.700> carrier

00:01:38.690 --> 00:01:38.700 
now when I popped out there's my carrier

00:01:38.700 --> 00:01:46.430 
now when I popped out there's my carrier
fleet<00:01:40.700> so<00:01:44.270> so<00:01:45.270> not<00:01:45.450> these<00:01:45.660> aren't<00:01:45.840> just<00:01:46.050> pretty

00:01:46.430 --> 00:01:46.440 
fleet so so not these aren't just pretty

00:01:46.440 --> 00:01:48.020 
fleet so so not these aren't just pretty
pretty<00:01:46.920> both<00:01:47.160> sitting<00:01:47.430> in<00:01:47.520> the<00:01:47.580> water<00:01:47.729> they're

00:01:48.020 --> 00:01:48.030 
pretty both sitting in the water they're

00:01:48.030 --> 00:01:49.400 
pretty both sitting in the water they're
gonna<00:01:48.120> actually<00:01:48.450> protect<00:01:48.780> me<00:01:48.900> so<00:01:49.050> when<00:01:49.170> I<00:01:49.229> get

00:01:49.400 --> 00:01:49.410 
gonna actually protect me so when I get

00:01:49.410 --> 00:01:51.410 
gonna actually protect me so when I get
close<00:01:49.710> to<00:01:49.740> them<00:01:50.160> they're<00:01:50.760> gonna<00:01:50.850> see<00:01:51.120> that<00:01:51.270> any

00:01:51.410 --> 00:01:51.420 
close to them they're gonna see that any
