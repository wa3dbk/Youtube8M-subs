in<00:00:01.150> this<00:00:01.510> video<00:00:01.870> I<00:00:02.229> will<00:00:02.469> try<00:00:02.739> and<00:00:03.219> provide<00:00:03.699> you

00:00:03.899 --> 00:00:03.909 
in this video I will try and provide you

00:00:03.909 --> 00:00:07.110 
in this video I will try and provide you
with<00:00:04.180> three<00:00:04.660> ways<00:00:05.200> to<00:00:05.700> reduce<00:00:06.700> water

00:00:07.110 --> 00:00:07.120 
with three ways to reduce water

00:00:07.120 --> 00:00:10.079 
with three ways to reduce water
hammering<00:00:08.080> noises<00:00:08.589> this<00:00:09.459> would<00:00:09.669> be<00:00:09.789> of<00:00:09.879> course

00:00:10.079 --> 00:00:10.089 
hammering noises this would be of course

00:00:10.089 --> 00:00:15.679 
hammering noises this would be of course
noises<00:00:11.459> created<00:00:12.459> when<00:00:12.969> you<00:00:13.269> shut<00:00:13.809> off<00:00:14.490> your

00:00:15.679 --> 00:00:15.689 
noises created when you shut off your

00:00:15.689 --> 00:00:18.330 
noises created when you shut off your
faucets<00:00:16.689> so<00:00:16.990> if<00:00:17.080> you're<00:00:17.289> in<00:00:17.470> your<00:00:17.590> kitchen<00:00:17.800> and

00:00:18.330 --> 00:00:18.340 
faucets so if you're in your kitchen and

00:00:18.340 --> 00:00:20.220 
faucets so if you're in your kitchen and
you<00:00:18.699> shut<00:00:18.939> your<00:00:19.119> faucet<00:00:19.570> off<00:00:19.689> and<00:00:20.019> you<00:00:20.080> hear

00:00:20.220 --> 00:00:20.230 
you shut your faucet off and you hear

00:00:20.230 --> 00:00:22.769 
you shut your faucet off and you hear
the<00:00:20.410> pipes<00:00:20.619> go<00:00:20.830> bang<00:00:21.070> bang<00:00:21.279> or<00:00:21.550> bang<00:00:22.119> once<00:00:22.420> or

00:00:22.769 --> 00:00:22.779 
the pipes go bang bang or bang once or

00:00:22.779 --> 00:00:25.079 
the pipes go bang bang or bang once or
someone<00:00:23.289> just<00:00:23.470> go<00:00:23.619> pop<00:00:24.310> up<00:00:24.429> above<00:00:24.580> sound<00:00:25.000> like

00:00:25.079 --> 00:00:25.089 
someone just go pop up above sound like

00:00:25.089 --> 00:00:28.259 
someone just go pop up above sound like
a<00:00:25.119> machine<00:00:25.570> gun<00:00:25.859> well<00:00:26.859> here<00:00:27.640> are<00:00:27.789> three<00:00:28.089> ways

00:00:28.259 --> 00:00:28.269 
a machine gun well here are three ways

00:00:28.269 --> 00:00:32.790 
a machine gun well here are three ways
that<00:00:28.330> I<00:00:28.630> tried<00:00:29.439> to<00:00:29.830> reduce<00:00:30.279> this<00:00:31.110> noise<00:00:32.110> and<00:00:32.649> I

00:00:32.790 --> 00:00:32.800 
that I tried to reduce this noise and I

00:00:32.800 --> 00:00:34.860 
that I tried to reduce this noise and I
still<00:00:33.039> haven't<00:00:33.370> got<00:00:33.820> it<00:00:34.030> a<00:00:34.180> hundred<00:00:34.600> percent

00:00:34.860 --> 00:00:34.870 
still haven't got it a hundred percent

00:00:34.870 --> 00:00:37.170 
still haven't got it a hundred percent
but<00:00:35.590> I<00:00:35.649> am<00:00:35.860> going<00:00:36.160> to<00:00:36.250> share<00:00:36.489> them<00:00:36.789> with<00:00:36.820> you

00:00:37.170 --> 00:00:37.180 
but I am going to share them with you

00:00:37.180 --> 00:00:40.740 
but I am going to share them with you
and<00:00:37.329> share<00:00:37.660> the<00:00:37.870> results<00:00:37.899> of<00:00:39.239> what<00:00:40.239> actually

00:00:40.740 --> 00:00:40.750 
and share the results of what actually

00:00:40.750 --> 00:00:43.650 
and share the results of what actually
happened<00:00:41.289> now<00:00:41.590> the<00:00:42.370> water<00:00:42.670> hammering<00:00:43.390> that<00:00:43.600> I

00:00:43.650 --> 00:00:43.660 
happened now the water hammering that I

00:00:43.660 --> 00:00:45.420 
happened now the water hammering that I
was<00:00:43.989> dealing<00:00:44.170> with<00:00:44.410> was<00:00:44.620> in<00:00:45.070> the<00:00:45.160> garage<00:00:45.399> I

00:00:45.420 --> 00:00:45.430 
was dealing with was in the garage I

00:00:45.430 --> 00:00:47.880 
was dealing with was in the garage I
kept<00:00:45.910> hearing<00:00:46.090> the<00:00:46.329> noise<00:00:46.510> so<00:00:47.379> the<00:00:47.559> first

00:00:47.880 --> 00:00:47.890 
kept hearing the noise so the first

00:00:47.890 --> 00:00:52.319 
kept hearing the noise so the first
thing<00:00:48.489> I<00:00:48.699> installed<00:00:49.300> was<00:00:49.600> an<00:00:49.750> air<00:00:50.109> chamber<00:00:51.329> and

00:00:52.319 --> 00:00:52.329 
thing I installed was an air chamber and

00:00:52.329 --> 00:00:53.880 
thing I installed was an air chamber and
that's<00:00:52.449> what<00:00:52.719> you're<00:00:52.899> looking<00:00:52.930> at<00:00:53.410> here

00:00:53.880 --> 00:00:53.890 
that's what you're looking at here

00:00:53.890 --> 00:00:55.830 
that's what you're looking at here
that's<00:00:54.070> what's<00:00:54.340> circled<00:00:54.760> in<00:00:54.940> the<00:00:55.030> white<00:00:55.239> oval

00:00:55.830 --> 00:00:55.840 
that's what's circled in the white oval

00:00:55.840 --> 00:01:00.000 
that's what's circled in the white oval
there<00:00:56.109> and<00:00:56.460> this<00:00:57.460> reduced<00:00:58.179> the<00:00:58.449> noise<00:00:58.660> I<00:00:59.199> would

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:00.010 
there and this reduced the noise I would

00:01:00.010 --> 00:01:03.840 
there and this reduced the noise I would
say<00:01:00.340> maybe<00:01:01.300> twenty<00:01:01.929> percent<00:01:02.469> so<00:01:03.370> I<00:01:03.399> thought

00:01:03.840 --> 00:01:03.850 
say maybe twenty percent so I thought

00:01:03.850 --> 00:01:06.630 
say maybe twenty percent so I thought
okay<00:01:04.269> you<00:01:04.330> know<00:01:04.659> before<00:01:05.110> I<00:01:05.140> go<00:01:05.950> on<00:01:06.159> and<00:01:06.400> start

00:01:06.630 --> 00:01:06.640 
okay you know before I go on and start

00:01:06.640 --> 00:01:09.870 
okay you know before I go on and start
putting<00:01:07.259> these<00:01:08.259> valves<00:01:09.040> on<00:01:09.220> every<00:01:09.610> faucet

00:01:09.870 --> 00:01:09.880 
putting these valves on every faucet

00:01:09.880 --> 00:01:12.420 
putting these valves on every faucet
around<00:01:10.420> the<00:01:10.600> house<00:01:10.840> I<00:01:11.439> figured<00:01:12.040> I<00:01:12.100> would<00:01:12.250> try

00:01:12.420 --> 00:01:12.430 
around the house I figured I would try

00:01:12.430 --> 00:01:14.160 
around the house I figured I would try
it<00:01:12.580> in<00:01:12.880> the<00:01:13.000> garage<00:01:13.180> and<00:01:13.600> see<00:01:13.780> if<00:01:13.869> I<00:01:13.990> could

00:01:14.160 --> 00:01:14.170 
it in the garage and see if I could

00:01:14.170 --> 00:01:16.890 
it in the garage and see if I could
reduce<00:01:14.619> the<00:01:14.890> noise<00:01:15.070> with<00:01:15.970> a<00:01:16.000> least<00:01:16.360> amount<00:01:16.720> of

00:01:16.890 --> 00:01:16.900 
reduce the noise with a least amount of

00:01:16.900 --> 00:01:19.649 
reduce the noise with a least amount of
work<00:01:17.229> and<00:01:17.619> obviously<00:01:18.100> this<00:01:18.400> was<00:01:18.670> not<00:01:18.939> a<00:01:18.970> simple

00:01:19.649 --> 00:01:19.659 
work and obviously this was not a simple

00:01:19.659 --> 00:01:23.910 
work and obviously this was not a simple
task<00:01:19.720> I<00:01:20.439> was<00:01:21.220> removing<00:01:21.670> parts<00:01:22.299> and<00:01:22.920> soldering

00:01:23.910 --> 00:01:23.920 
task I was removing parts and soldering

00:01:23.920 --> 00:01:27.210 
task I was removing parts and soldering
new<00:01:24.220> pipes<00:01:24.579> on<00:01:25.229> now<00:01:26.229> the<00:01:26.320> second<00:01:26.860> thing<00:01:26.890> I

00:01:27.210 --> 00:01:27.220 
new pipes on now the second thing I

00:01:27.220 --> 00:01:30.929 
new pipes on now the second thing I
tried<00:01:27.610> was<00:01:28.000> adding<00:01:28.540> a<00:01:28.780> water<00:01:29.740> hammer<00:01:30.100> arrestor

00:01:30.929 --> 00:01:30.939 
tried was adding a water hammer arrestor

00:01:30.939 --> 00:01:35.520 
tried was adding a water hammer arrestor
these<00:01:31.329> are<00:01:31.540> called<00:01:31.720> many<00:01:32.220> many<00:01:34.530> restaurant

00:01:35.520 --> 00:01:35.530 
these are called many many restaurant

00:01:35.530 --> 00:01:37.710 
these are called many many restaurant
names<00:01:35.829> and<00:01:36.250> these<00:01:36.670> actually<00:01:37.119> have<00:01:37.149> little

00:01:37.710 --> 00:01:37.720 
names and these actually have little

00:01:37.720 --> 00:01:39.690 
names and these actually have little
Pistons<00:01:38.259> in<00:01:38.530> them<00:01:38.740> and<00:01:38.979> act<00:01:39.130> like<00:01:39.340> shock

00:01:39.690 --> 00:01:39.700 
Pistons in them and act like shock

00:01:39.700 --> 00:01:42.539 
Pistons in them and act like shock
absorbers<00:01:40.470> now<00:01:41.470> water<00:01:41.770> hammering<00:01:42.369> is

00:01:42.539 --> 00:01:42.549 
absorbers now water hammering is

00:01:42.549 --> 00:01:44.789 
absorbers now water hammering is
basically<00:01:43.090> caused<00:01:43.390> when<00:01:43.780> you<00:01:43.840> shut<00:01:44.290> a<00:01:44.530> valve

00:01:44.789 --> 00:01:44.799 
basically caused when you shut a valve

00:01:44.799 --> 00:01:47.609 
basically caused when you shut a valve
off<00:01:45.219> you<00:01:45.610> shut<00:01:45.880> a<00:01:45.909> valve<00:01:46.180> off<00:01:46.479> the<00:01:47.320> water

00:01:47.609 --> 00:01:47.619 
off you shut a valve off the water

00:01:47.619 --> 00:01:50.910 
off you shut a valve off the water
pressure<00:01:48.040> keeps<00:01:48.549> coming<00:01:49.240> and<00:01:49.590> when<00:01:50.590> you<00:01:50.710> shut

00:01:50.910 --> 00:01:50.920 
pressure keeps coming and when you shut

00:01:50.920 --> 00:01:53.789 
pressure keeps coming and when you shut
the<00:01:51.100> valve<00:01:51.250> off<00:01:51.520> the<00:01:51.880> water<00:01:52.149> pressure<00:01:52.799> wants

00:01:53.789 --> 00:01:53.799 
the valve off the water pressure wants

00:01:53.799 --> 00:01:56.819 
the valve off the water pressure wants
to<00:01:53.979> one<00:01:54.340> stick<00:01:54.610> wants<00:01:54.969> to<00:01:55.180> keep<00:01:56.170> coming<00:01:56.590> out<00:01:56.740> of

00:01:56.819 --> 00:01:56.829 
to one stick wants to keep coming out of

00:01:56.829 --> 00:02:00.060 
to one stick wants to keep coming out of
the<00:01:56.920> faucet<00:01:57.399> that<00:01:57.549> abrupt<00:01:58.149> stop<00:01:59.070> actually

00:02:00.060 --> 00:02:00.070 
the faucet that abrupt stop actually

00:02:00.070 --> 00:02:02.670 
the faucet that abrupt stop actually
causes<00:02:00.640> the<00:02:00.850> noise<00:02:01.149> that<00:02:01.180> kind<00:02:01.899> once<00:02:02.170> to<00:02:02.350> it

00:02:02.670 --> 00:02:02.680 
causes the noise that kind once to it

00:02:02.680 --> 00:02:04.560 
causes the noise that kind once to it
sends<00:02:03.219> it<00:02:03.310> back<00:02:03.369> and<00:02:03.820> that<00:02:03.880> sends<00:02:04.180> a<00:02:04.299> shock

00:02:04.560 --> 00:02:04.570 
sends it back and that sends a shock

00:02:04.570 --> 00:02:07.800 
sends it back and that sends a shock
wave<00:02:04.840> back<00:02:05.229> which<00:02:05.500> actually<00:02:06.360> makes<00:02:07.360> the<00:02:07.600> noise

00:02:07.800 --> 00:02:07.810 
wave back which actually makes the noise

00:02:07.810 --> 00:02:11.670 
wave back which actually makes the noise
and<00:02:08.970> so<00:02:09.970> this<00:02:10.360> right<00:02:10.750> here<00:02:10.810> when<00:02:11.200> I<00:02:11.230> put<00:02:11.500> this

00:02:11.670 --> 00:02:11.680 
and so this right here when I put this

00:02:11.680 --> 00:02:12.990 
and so this right here when I put this
on<00:02:11.950> I<00:02:12.280> want<00:02:12.610> to<00:02:12.670> say

00:02:12.990 --> 00:02:13.000 
on I want to say

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:17.910 
on I want to say
it<00:02:13.950> it<00:02:14.950> it<00:02:15.520> felt<00:02:15.940> like<00:02:16.240> it<00:02:16.960> reduced<00:02:17.470> it<00:02:17.710> like

00:02:17.910 --> 00:02:17.920 
it it it felt like it reduced it like

00:02:17.920 --> 00:02:21.060 
it it it felt like it reduced it like
another<00:02:18.100> 10<00:02:19.030> or<00:02:19.240> 20<00:02:19.600> percent<00:02:19.780> but<00:02:20.320> in<00:02:20.440> reality

00:02:21.060 --> 00:02:21.070 
another 10 or 20 percent but in reality

00:02:21.070 --> 00:02:23.310 
another 10 or 20 percent but in reality
I<00:02:21.340> don't<00:02:22.030> think<00:02:22.270> it<00:02:22.420> did<00:02:22.570> much<00:02:22.900> and<00:02:23.230> again

00:02:23.310 --> 00:02:23.320 
I don't think it did much and again

00:02:23.320 --> 00:02:27.660 
I don't think it did much and again
maybe<00:02:23.860> the<00:02:24.190> location<00:02:25.170> wasn't<00:02:26.490> it<00:02:27.490> wasn't

00:02:27.660 --> 00:02:27.670 
maybe the location wasn't it wasn't

00:02:27.670 --> 00:02:30.660 
maybe the location wasn't it wasn't
located<00:02:28.330> in<00:02:28.450> the<00:02:28.570> right<00:02:28.720> spot<00:02:29.200> and<00:02:30.070> if<00:02:30.220> there

of the of the actual installation of
these<00:02:58.330> products<00:02:58.930> I<00:02:59.020> wasn't<00:02:59.410> real<00:02:59.530> happy<00:02:59.740> with

00:03:00.180 --> 00:03:00.190 
these products I wasn't real happy with

00:03:00.190 --> 00:03:03.840 
these products I wasn't real happy with
this<00:03:00.610> particular<00:03:01.030> product<00:03:01.600> either<00:03:02.850> now

00:03:03.840 --> 00:03:03.850 
this particular product either now

00:03:03.850 --> 00:03:06.510 
this particular product either now
here's<00:03:04.300> the<00:03:04.870> plumbing<00:03:05.740> part<00:03:06.010> that<00:03:06.250> really

00:03:06.510 --> 00:03:06.520 
here's the plumbing part that really

00:03:06.520 --> 00:03:08.910 
here's the plumbing part that really
made<00:03:07.120> a<00:03:07.420> difference<00:03:07.480> and<00:03:08.440> this<00:03:08.500> was<00:03:08.740> actually

00:03:08.910 --> 00:03:08.920 
made a difference and this was actually

00:03:08.920 --> 00:03:12.600 
made a difference and this was actually
a<00:03:09.630> pressure<00:03:10.630> relief<00:03:11.230> valve<00:03:11.620> and<00:03:12.070> they<00:03:12.370> usually

00:03:12.600 --> 00:03:12.610 
a pressure relief valve and they usually

00:03:12.610 --> 00:03:17.160 
a pressure relief valve and they usually
put<00:03:13.090> these<00:03:13.360> on<00:03:13.660> the<00:03:14.440> on<00:03:15.030> the<00:03:16.030> right<00:03:16.660> after<00:03:16.930> your

00:03:17.160 --> 00:03:17.170 
put these on the on the right after your

00:03:17.170 --> 00:03:19.170 
put these on the on the right after your
water<00:03:17.440> meter<00:03:17.709> so<00:03:18.010> it<00:03:18.070> would<00:03:18.430> go<00:03:18.550> anywhere<00:03:18.760> in

00:03:19.170 --> 00:03:19.180 
water meter so it would go anywhere in

00:03:19.180 --> 00:03:22.650 
water meter so it would go anywhere in
between<00:03:19.510> your<00:03:19.690> water<00:03:19.989> meter<00:03:20.350> and<00:03:21.209> your<00:03:22.209> home

00:03:22.650 --> 00:03:22.660 
between your water meter and your home

00:03:22.660 --> 00:03:25.530 
between your water meter and your home
and<00:03:23.050> actually<00:03:23.590> this<00:03:24.160> valve<00:03:24.760> this<00:03:25.060> pipe<00:03:25.269> right

00:03:25.530 --> 00:03:25.540 
and actually this valve this pipe right

00:03:25.540 --> 00:03:29.580 
and actually this valve this pipe right
here<00:03:25.750> this<00:03:25.870> half-inch<00:03:26.350> pipe<00:03:27.930> coming<00:03:28.930> out<00:03:29.200> is

00:03:29.580 --> 00:03:29.590 
here this half-inch pipe coming out is

00:03:29.590 --> 00:03:33.690 
here this half-inch pipe coming out is
actually<00:03:29.890> from<00:03:30.580> the<00:03:32.010> water<00:03:33.010> meter<00:03:33.370> so<00:03:33.580> the

00:03:33.690 --> 00:03:33.700 
actually from the water meter so the

00:03:33.700 --> 00:03:35.370 
actually from the water meter so the
water<00:03:33.910> meter<00:03:34.150> comes<00:03:34.450> into<00:03:34.720> the<00:03:34.810> house<00:03:34.989> through

00:03:35.370 --> 00:03:35.380 
water meter comes into the house through

00:03:35.380 --> 00:03:37.530 
water meter comes into the house through
a<00:03:35.440> hose<00:03:35.709> bib<00:03:36.070> and<00:03:36.280> then<00:03:36.760> goes<00:03:36.970> under<00:03:37.420> the

00:03:37.530 --> 00:03:37.540 
a hose bib and then goes under the

00:03:37.540 --> 00:03:40.530 
a hose bib and then goes under the
concrete<00:03:38.200> to<00:03:38.950> the<00:03:39.160> water<00:03:39.400> heater<00:03:39.790> and<00:03:40.180> I've

00:03:40.530 --> 00:03:40.540 
concrete to the water heater and I've

00:03:40.540 --> 00:03:43.920 
concrete to the water heater and I've
actually<00:03:40.690> replumbed<00:03:41.590> the<00:03:42.540> entire<00:03:43.540> house

00:03:43.920 --> 00:03:43.930 
actually replumbed the entire house

00:03:43.930 --> 00:03:46.710 
actually replumbed the entire house
because<00:03:44.500> of<00:03:44.709> the<00:03:45.130> prompt<00:03:45.700> attention<00:03:45.940> problems

00:03:46.710 --> 00:03:46.720 
because of the prompt attention problems

00:03:46.720 --> 00:03:49.440 
because of the prompt attention problems
I<00:03:46.840> wanted<00:03:47.110> to<00:03:47.260> eliminate<00:03:47.560> with<00:03:48.549> plumbing

00:03:49.440 --> 00:03:49.450 
I wanted to eliminate with plumbing

00:03:49.450 --> 00:03:53.580 
I wanted to eliminate with plumbing
under<00:03:49.950> the<00:03:50.950> slabs<00:03:51.549> that<00:03:51.940> star<00:03:52.930> starting<00:03:53.440> to

00:03:53.580 --> 00:03:53.590 
under the slabs that star starting to

00:03:53.590 --> 00:03:55.350 
under the slabs that star starting to
leak<00:03:53.920> in<00:03:54.190> the<00:03:54.340> neighborhood<00:03:54.910> and<00:03:55.030> the<00:03:55.120> kind<00:03:55.330> of

00:03:55.350 --> 00:03:55.360 
leak in the neighborhood and the kind of

00:03:55.360 --> 00:03:57.750 
leak in the neighborhood and the kind of
one<00:03:55.510> to<00:03:55.660> jump<00:03:55.900> the<00:03:56.049> gun<00:03:56.080> on<00:03:56.260> this<00:03:56.739> so<00:03:57.519> I<00:03:57.549> have

00:03:57.750 --> 00:03:57.760 
one to jump the gun on this so I have

00:03:57.760 --> 00:03:59.699 
one to jump the gun on this so I have
one<00:03:58.030> pipe<00:03:58.330> that's<00:03:58.750> underneath<00:03:59.230> the<00:03:59.350> house

00:03:59.699 --> 00:03:59.709 
one pipe that's underneath the house

00:03:59.709 --> 00:04:01.740 
one pipe that's underneath the house
right<00:04:00.010> now<00:04:00.310> that<00:04:00.340> could<00:04:00.730> be<00:04:00.910> a<00:04:00.940> problem<00:04:01.239> but<00:04:01.660> at

00:04:01.740 --> 00:04:01.750 
right now that could be a problem but at

00:04:01.750 --> 00:04:04.560 
right now that could be a problem but at
least<00:04:01.900> I<00:04:02.049> don't<00:04:02.110> have<00:04:03.030> you<00:04:04.030> know<00:04:04.150> ten<00:04:04.450> or

00:04:04.560 --> 00:04:04.570 
least I don't have you know ten or

00:04:04.570 --> 00:04:07.170 
least I don't have you know ten or
twenty<00:04:04.930> pipes<00:04:05.200> underneath<00:04:05.650> the<00:04:05.920> house<00:04:06.100> so<00:04:06.970> at

00:04:07.170 --> 00:04:07.180 
twenty pipes underneath the house so at

00:04:07.180 --> 00:04:08.759 
twenty pipes underneath the house so at
this<00:04:07.299> one<00:04:07.480> ever<00:04:07.630> does<00:04:07.810> become<00:04:08.170> a<00:04:08.200> problem<00:04:08.290> I

00:04:08.759 --> 00:04:08.769 
this one ever does become a problem I

00:04:08.769 --> 00:04:13.199 
this one ever does become a problem I
will<00:04:10.290> run<00:04:11.290> another<00:04:12.040> pipe<00:04:12.370> from<00:04:12.610> the<00:04:12.730> from<00:04:13.090> the

00:04:13.199 --> 00:04:13.209 
will run another pipe from the from the

00:04:13.209 --> 00:04:16.650 
will run another pipe from the from the
water<00:04:13.510> meter<00:04:13.870> directly<00:04:14.560> to<00:04:15.489> the<00:04:15.910> water<00:04:16.269> heater

00:04:16.650 --> 00:04:16.660 
water meter directly to the water heater

00:04:16.660 --> 00:04:18.060 
water meter directly to the water heater
and<00:04:16.900> that<00:04:17.080> will<00:04:17.229> send<00:04:17.440> it<00:04:17.590> through<00:04:17.739> the<00:04:17.859> rest

00:04:18.060 --> 00:04:18.070 
and that will send it through the rest

00:04:18.070 --> 00:04:21.839 
and that will send it through the rest
of<00:04:18.280> the<00:04:18.430> house<00:04:18.640> now<00:04:19.000> this<00:04:19.380> one<00:04:20.380> here<00:04:20.950> basically

00:04:21.839 --> 00:04:21.849 
of the house now this one here basically

00:04:21.849 --> 00:04:25.409 
of the house now this one here basically
solved<00:04:22.300> the<00:04:22.419> problem<00:04:22.960> but<00:04:23.910> we<00:04:24.910> paid<00:04:25.150> a<00:04:25.180> high

00:04:25.409 --> 00:04:25.419 
solved the problem but we paid a high

00:04:25.419 --> 00:04:26.670 
solved the problem but we paid a high
price<00:04:25.450> for<00:04:25.840> it<00:04:26.229> and

00:04:26.670 --> 00:04:26.680 
price for it and

00:04:26.680 --> 00:04:29.790 
price for it and
I'm<00:04:26.979> not<00:04:27.310> done<00:04:27.639> with<00:04:27.669> you<00:04:28.530> no<00:04:29.530> I'm<00:04:29.590> still

00:04:29.790 --> 00:04:29.800 
I'm not done with you no I'm still

00:04:29.800 --> 00:04:31.650 
I'm not done with you no I'm still
looking<00:04:29.949> for<00:04:30.280> solutions<00:04:30.790> out<00:04:31.000> there<00:04:31.030> and<00:04:31.570> I

00:04:31.650 --> 00:04:31.660 
looking for solutions out there and I

00:04:31.660 --> 00:04:35.300 
looking for solutions out there and I
will<00:04:31.720> report<00:04:32.380> them<00:04:32.680> as<00:04:32.979> I<00:04:33.520> as<00:04:33.880> they<00:04:34.509> work<00:04:34.720> out

00:04:35.300 --> 00:04:35.310 
will report them as I as they work out

00:04:35.310 --> 00:04:37.499 
will report them as I as they work out
but<00:04:36.310> I'm<00:04:36.520> just<00:04:36.610> going<00:04:36.789> to<00:04:36.820> be<00:04:36.970> trying<00:04:37.240> one

00:04:37.499 --> 00:04:37.509 
but I'm just going to be trying one

00:04:37.509 --> 00:04:40.610 
but I'm just going to be trying one
thing<00:04:37.539> at<00:04:37.900> a<00:04:37.990> time<00:04:38.020> but<00:04:38.470> the<00:04:38.650> water<00:04:39.000> regulator

00:04:40.610 --> 00:04:40.620 
thing at a time but the water regulator

00:04:40.620 --> 00:04:44.330 
thing at a time but the water regulator
realistically<00:04:42.270> eliminated<00:04:43.270> the<00:04:43.419> noise<00:04:43.660> about

00:04:44.330 --> 00:04:44.340 
realistically eliminated the noise about

00:04:44.340 --> 00:04:47.580 
realistically eliminated the noise about
70%<00:04:45.340> at<00:04:45.639> this<00:04:45.940> thing<00:04:46.180> right<00:04:46.389> here<00:04:46.419> and<00:04:46.960> I'm

00:04:47.580 --> 00:04:47.590 
70% at this thing right here and I'm

00:04:47.590 --> 00:04:49.560 
70% at this thing right here and I'm
sure<00:04:47.800> I<00:04:47.860> could<00:04:48.130> adjust<00:04:48.460> it<00:04:48.669> down<00:04:48.880> even<00:04:49.180> farther

00:04:49.560 --> 00:04:49.570 
sure I could adjust it down even farther

00:04:49.570 --> 00:04:51.840 
sure I could adjust it down even farther
to<00:04:49.750> get<00:04:50.080> rid<00:04:50.229> of<00:04:50.320> the<00:04:50.380> noise<00:04:50.530> completely<00:04:51.340> but

00:04:51.840 --> 00:04:51.850 
to get rid of the noise completely but

00:04:51.850 --> 00:04:55.170 
to get rid of the noise completely but
at<00:04:52.180> the<00:04:52.539> same<00:04:52.810> time<00:04:53.199> it<00:04:54.070> reduced<00:04:54.669> the<00:04:54.850> water

00:04:55.170 --> 00:04:55.180 
at the same time it reduced the water

00:04:55.180 --> 00:04:58.469 
at the same time it reduced the water
pressure<00:04:55.780> to<00:04:56.229> the<00:04:56.410> house<00:04:56.740> I<00:04:57.160> would<00:04:57.820> imagine<00:04:57.940> by

00:04:58.469 --> 00:04:58.479 
pressure to the house I would imagine by

00:04:58.479 --> 00:05:02.460 
pressure to the house I would imagine by
about<00:04:59.039> 25%<00:05:00.039> and<00:05:00.479> when<00:05:01.479> I<00:05:01.510> say<00:05:01.870> that<00:05:02.139> we<00:05:02.320> can

00:05:02.460 --> 00:05:02.470 
about 25% and when I say that we can

00:05:02.470 --> 00:05:04.140 
about 25% and when I say that we can
still<00:05:02.740> go<00:05:02.919> in<00:05:03.100> I<00:05:03.250> quake<00:05:03.490> I<00:05:03.639> can<00:05:03.820> turn<00:05:04.000> the

00:05:04.140 --> 00:05:04.150 
still go in I quake I can turn the

00:05:04.150 --> 00:05:05.760 
still go in I quake I can turn the
faucet<00:05:04.360> on<00:05:04.660> in<00:05:04.840> the<00:05:04.930> bathroom<00:05:05.320> turn<00:05:05.590> the

00:05:05.760 --> 00:05:05.770 
faucet on in the bathroom turn the

00:05:05.770 --> 00:05:07.920 
faucet on in the bathroom turn the
showers<00:05:06.220> on<00:05:06.460> flush<00:05:06.910> the<00:05:07.090> toilets<00:05:07.539> and<00:05:07.690> still

00:05:07.920 --> 00:05:07.930 
showers on flush the toilets and still

00:05:07.930 --> 00:05:10.379 
showers on flush the toilets and still
get<00:05:08.139> enough<00:05:08.380> water<00:05:08.680> pressure<00:05:09.060> but<00:05:10.060> what<00:05:10.270> I'm

00:05:10.379 --> 00:05:10.389 
get enough water pressure but what I'm

00:05:10.389 --> 00:05:12.920 
get enough water pressure but what I'm
not<00:05:10.419> getting<00:05:10.840> is<00:05:11.440> the<00:05:11.710> same<00:05:12.250> water<00:05:12.520> pressure

00:05:12.920 --> 00:05:12.930 
not getting is the same water pressure

00:05:12.930 --> 00:05:15.629 
not getting is the same water pressure
coming<00:05:13.930> out<00:05:14.050> of<00:05:14.199> the<00:05:14.289> kitchen<00:05:14.500> faucet<00:05:15.370> and

00:05:15.629 --> 00:05:15.639 
coming out of the kitchen faucet and

00:05:15.639 --> 00:05:18.750 
coming out of the kitchen faucet and
that's<00:05:16.210> the<00:05:16.449> only<00:05:16.960> that's<00:05:17.860> the<00:05:18.099> only<00:05:18.520> thing

00:05:18.750 --> 00:05:18.760 
that's the only that's the only thing

00:05:18.760 --> 00:05:20.550 
that's the only that's the only thing
where<00:05:18.970> I'm<00:05:19.060> really<00:05:19.210> seeing<00:05:19.630> a<00:05:19.810> big<00:05:20.080> difference

00:05:20.550 --> 00:05:20.560 
where I'm really seeing a big difference

00:05:20.560 --> 00:05:22.890 
where I'm really seeing a big difference
in<00:05:20.740> the<00:05:20.830> water<00:05:21.070> pressure<00:05:21.660> for<00:05:22.660> whatever

00:05:22.890 --> 00:05:22.900 
in the water pressure for whatever

00:05:22.900 --> 00:05:26.249 
in the water pressure for whatever
reason<00:05:23.590> the<00:05:23.919> showers<00:05:24.490> seem<00:05:24.849> do<00:05:25.030> showers<00:05:25.870> might

00:05:26.249 --> 00:05:26.259 
reason the showers seem do showers might

00:05:26.259 --> 00:05:29.900 
reason the showers seem do showers might
have<00:05:26.620> decreased<00:05:27.310> the<00:05:27.789> water<00:05:28.030> pressure<00:05:28.590> 10%

00:05:29.900 --> 00:05:29.910 
have decreased the water pressure 10%

00:05:29.910 --> 00:05:32.659 
have decreased the water pressure 10%
but<00:05:30.910> I<00:05:31.090> don't<00:05:31.270> I<00:05:31.360> don't<00:05:31.419> think<00:05:31.630> it<00:05:31.900> was<00:05:32.020> much

00:05:32.659 --> 00:05:32.669 
but I don't I don't think it was much

00:05:32.669 --> 00:05:36.120 
but I don't I don't think it was much
now<00:05:33.669> there<00:05:33.849> is<00:05:33.970> one<00:05:34.270> more<00:05:34.479> thing<00:05:34.780> I<00:05:35.110> did<00:05:35.800> after

00:05:36.120 --> 00:05:36.130 
now there is one more thing I did after

00:05:36.130 --> 00:05:39.060 
now there is one more thing I did after
I<00:05:36.940> kind<00:05:37.419> of<00:05:37.510> looked<00:05:37.720> at<00:05:37.870> this<00:05:38.020> mess<00:05:38.380> here<00:05:38.770> and<00:05:38.800> I

00:05:39.060 --> 00:05:39.070 
I kind of looked at this mess here and I

00:05:39.070 --> 00:05:42.029 
I kind of looked at this mess here and I
think<00:05:39.340> I<00:05:39.460> counted<00:05:39.970> six<00:05:40.330> 90-degree<00:05:41.289> bends<00:05:41.680> and

00:05:42.029 --> 00:05:42.039 
think I counted six 90-degree bends and

00:05:42.039 --> 00:05:44.490 
think I counted six 90-degree bends and
the<00:05:42.190> pipes<00:05:42.490> and<00:05:42.880> I<00:05:43.690> thought<00:05:43.900> that<00:05:44.110> this<00:05:44.289> would

00:05:44.490 --> 00:05:44.500 
the pipes and I thought that this would

00:05:44.500 --> 00:05:46.339 
the pipes and I thought that this would
actually<00:05:44.530> make<00:05:45.159> a<00:05:45.190> difference<00:05:45.460> if<00:05:45.849> I<00:05:46.030> could

00:05:46.339 --> 00:05:46.349 
actually make a difference if I could

00:05:46.349 --> 00:05:50.100 
actually make a difference if I could
remove<00:05:47.349> some<00:05:47.800> of<00:05:47.830> these<00:05:48.099> 90<00:05:48.699> degrees<00:05:49.120> 90

00:05:50.100 --> 00:05:50.110 
remove some of these 90 degrees 90

00:05:50.110 --> 00:05:52.830 
remove some of these 90 degrees 90
degree<00:05:50.710> turns<00:05:51.070> in<00:05:51.490> the<00:05:52.030> plumbing<00:05:52.389> and

00:05:52.830 --> 00:05:52.840 
degree turns in the plumbing and

00:05:52.840 --> 00:05:56.189 
degree turns in the plumbing and
actually<00:05:53.620> it<00:05:53.979> didn't<00:05:54.280> really<00:05:54.490> do<00:05:54.699> do<00:05:55.599> anything

00:05:56.189 --> 00:05:56.199 
actually it didn't really do do anything

00:05:56.199 --> 00:05:58.409 
actually it didn't really do do anything
and<00:05:56.409> again<00:05:56.889> there<00:05:57.250> might<00:05:57.370> have<00:05:57.430> been<00:05:57.639> a<00:05:57.669> 10%

00:05:58.409 --> 00:05:58.419 
and again there might have been a 10%

00:05:58.419 --> 00:06:01.469 
and again there might have been a 10%
decrease<00:05:59.320> but<00:05:59.889> I<00:05:59.949> really<00:06:00.490> couldn't<00:06:00.789> tell<00:06:01.090> but

00:06:01.469 --> 00:06:01.479 
decrease but I really couldn't tell but

00:06:01.479 --> 00:06:04.230 
decrease but I really couldn't tell but
I<00:06:01.510> went<00:06:01.750> ahead<00:06:01.840> and<00:06:02.080> I<00:06:02.380> removed<00:06:02.889> the<00:06:03.550> air

00:06:04.230 --> 00:06:04.240 
I went ahead and I removed the air

00:06:04.240 --> 00:06:07.020 
I went ahead and I removed the air
chamber<00:06:04.900> and<00:06:05.110> the<00:06:05.770> the<00:06:06.460> water<00:06:06.760> hammer

00:06:07.020 --> 00:06:07.030 
chamber and the the water hammer

00:06:07.030 --> 00:06:10.020 
chamber and the the water hammer
arrestor<00:06:07.780> and<00:06:08.610> eliminated<00:06:09.610> all<00:06:09.789> of<00:06:09.849> the

00:06:10.020 --> 00:06:10.030 
arrestor and eliminated all of the

00:06:10.030 --> 00:06:12.719 
arrestor and eliminated all of the
90-degree<00:06:10.840> bends<00:06:11.110> in<00:06:11.380> there<00:06:11.650> like<00:06:12.370> I<00:06:12.520> said

00:06:12.719 --> 00:06:12.729 
90-degree bends in there like I said

00:06:12.729 --> 00:06:15.510 
90-degree bends in there like I said
hoping<00:06:13.300> it<00:06:13.479> would<00:06:13.630> make<00:06:13.810> a<00:06:13.840> difference<00:06:14.220> and<00:06:15.220> it

00:06:15.510 --> 00:06:15.520 
hoping it would make a difference and it

00:06:15.520 --> 00:06:19.740 
hoping it would make a difference and it
really<00:06:15.820> didn't<00:06:16.360> so<00:06:16.990> again<00:06:18.180> to<00:06:19.180> recap

00:06:19.740 --> 00:06:19.750 
really didn't so again to recap

00:06:19.750 --> 00:06:21.750 
really didn't so again to recap
everything<00:06:20.169> I<00:06:20.710> tried<00:06:21.039> four<00:06:21.370> different<00:06:21.729> things

00:06:21.750 --> 00:06:21.760 
everything I tried four different things

00:06:21.760 --> 00:06:24.420 
everything I tried four different things
here<00:06:22.330> to<00:06:23.020> reduce<00:06:23.349> the<00:06:23.560> water<00:06:23.710> hammering

00:06:24.420 --> 00:06:24.430 
here to reduce the water hammering

00:06:24.430 --> 00:06:28.939 
here to reduce the water hammering
eliminating<00:06:25.180> some<00:06:25.419> of<00:06:25.449> the<00:06:25.630> 90<00:06:26.020> degree<00:06:26.139> angles

00:06:28.939 --> 00:06:28.949 
eliminating some of the 90 degree angles

00:06:28.949 --> 00:06:31.439 
eliminating some of the 90 degree angles
reducing<00:06:29.949> the<00:06:30.039> water<00:06:30.220> pressure<00:06:30.699> putting<00:06:31.210> the

00:06:31.439 --> 00:06:31.449 
reducing the water pressure putting the

00:06:31.449 --> 00:06:34.050 
reducing the water pressure putting the
air<00:06:31.570> chambers<00:06:32.169> on<00:06:32.349> and<00:06:32.770> the<00:06:33.070> mini<00:06:33.460> arrestor

00:06:34.050 --> 00:06:34.060 
air chambers on and the mini arrestor

00:06:34.060 --> 00:06:36.839 
air chambers on and the mini arrestor
and<00:06:34.360> the<00:06:34.539> best<00:06:34.900> result<00:06:35.500> I<00:06:35.740> had<00:06:36.099> and<00:06:36.460> it's<00:06:36.669> what

00:06:36.839 --> 00:06:36.849 
and the best result I had and it's what

00:06:36.849 --> 00:06:38.790 
and the best result I had and it's what
I<00:06:36.880> would<00:06:36.969> recommend<00:06:37.570> to<00:06:37.719> anyone

00:06:38.790 --> 00:06:38.800 
I would recommend to anyone

00:06:38.800 --> 00:06:42.120 
I would recommend to anyone
it<00:06:39.310> would<00:06:39.490> be<00:06:39.729> to<00:06:39.970> install<00:06:40.300> the<00:06:41.130> pressure

00:06:42.120 --> 00:06:42.130 
it would be to install the pressure

00:06:42.130 --> 00:06:44.249 
it would be to install the pressure
regulator<00:06:42.819> and<00:06:43.270> I<00:06:43.300> think<00:06:43.569> most<00:06:43.780> plumbers

00:06:44.249 --> 00:06:44.259 
regulator and I think most plumbers

00:06:44.259 --> 00:06:47.070 
regulator and I think most plumbers
would<00:06:44.500> agree<00:06:44.860> with<00:06:45.099> me<00:06:45.340> if<00:06:45.550> you<00:06:45.849> have<00:06:46.080> water

00:06:47.070 --> 00:06:47.080 
would agree with me if you have water

00:06:47.080 --> 00:06:51.360 
would agree with me if you have water
hammering<00:06:48.069> pipes<00:06:49.889> you<00:06:50.889> know<00:06:51.009> throughout<00:06:51.310> the

00:06:51.360 --> 00:06:51.370 
hammering pipes you know throughout the

00:06:51.370 --> 00:06:54.080 
hammering pipes you know throughout the
house<00:06:51.729> I<00:06:52.120> mean<00:06:52.360> if<00:06:52.449> you<00:06:52.539> just<00:06:52.720> have<00:06:52.900> one<00:06:53.069> pipe

00:06:54.080 --> 00:06:54.090 
house I mean if you just have one pipe

00:06:54.090 --> 00:06:56.939 
house I mean if you just have one pipe
you<00:06:55.090> know<00:06:55.210> you<00:06:55.300> just<00:06:55.479> have<00:06:55.630> one<00:06:55.990> water<00:06:56.590> valve

00:06:56.939 --> 00:06:56.949 
you know you just have one water valve

00:06:56.949 --> 00:06:59.159 
you know you just have one water valve
that<00:06:57.340> is<00:06:57.400> hammering<00:06:58.150> then<00:06:58.840> you<00:06:58.960> could

00:06:59.159 --> 00:06:59.169 
that is hammering then you could

00:06:59.169 --> 00:07:00.870 
that is hammering then you could
probably<00:06:59.380> get<00:06:59.830> away<00:06:59.949> with<00:07:00.099> putting<00:07:00.490> one<00:07:00.789> of

00:07:00.870 --> 00:07:00.880 
probably get away with putting one of

00:07:00.880 --> 00:07:03.839 
probably get away with putting one of
these<00:07:00.970> arrest<00:07:01.389> errs<00:07:01.599> or<00:07:02.169> air<00:07:02.530> chambers<00:07:03.130> on<00:07:03.310> but

00:07:03.839 --> 00:07:03.849 
these arrest errs or air chambers on but

00:07:03.849 --> 00:07:06.689 
these arrest errs or air chambers on but
if<00:07:04.509> it's<00:07:04.690> throughout<00:07:05.020> the<00:07:05.199> home<00:07:05.430> in<00:07:06.430> a<00:07:06.550> variety

00:07:06.689 --> 00:07:06.699 
if it's throughout the home in a variety

00:07:06.699 --> 00:07:09.719 
if it's throughout the home in a variety
of<00:07:07.030> different<00:07:07.270> spots<00:07:07.750> I<00:07:08.349> think<00:07:08.919> I<00:07:09.009> think<00:07:09.610> I'd

00:07:09.719 --> 00:07:09.729 
of different spots I think I think I'd

00:07:09.729 --> 00:07:13.589 
of different spots I think I think I'd
go<00:07:09.940> with<00:07:10.270> the<00:07:11.400> pressure<00:07:12.400> regulator<00:07:12.970> for

00:07:13.589 --> 00:07:13.599 
go with the pressure regulator for

00:07:13.599 --> 00:07:15.089 
go with the pressure regulator for
starters<00:07:14.050> plus<00:07:14.289> this<00:07:14.440> is<00:07:14.500> something<00:07:14.979> you're

00:07:15.089 --> 00:07:15.099 
starters plus this is something you're

00:07:15.099 --> 00:07:16.890 
starters plus this is something you're
not<00:07:15.310> you<00:07:15.520> can<00:07:15.669> install<00:07:16.000> it<00:07:16.180> on<00:07:16.300> the<00:07:16.449> outside

00:07:16.890 --> 00:07:16.900 
not you can install it on the outside

00:07:16.900 --> 00:07:19.589 
not you can install it on the outside
most<00:07:17.289> of<00:07:17.470> them<00:07:17.620> are<00:07:17.770> installed<00:07:18.419> where<00:07:19.419> the

00:07:19.589 --> 00:07:19.599 
most of them are installed where the

00:07:19.599 --> 00:07:23.640 
most of them are installed where the
water<00:07:19.840> comes<00:07:20.139> into<00:07:20.500> the<00:07:20.620> house<00:07:21.990> and<00:07:22.990> of<00:07:23.470> course

00:07:23.640 --> 00:07:23.650 
water comes into the house and of course

00:07:23.650 --> 00:07:25.230 
water comes into the house and of course
you'd<00:07:23.770> have<00:07:23.830> to<00:07:23.949> find<00:07:24.340> that<00:07:24.520> usually<00:07:24.940> it's<00:07:25.060> by

00:07:25.230 --> 00:07:25.240 
you'd have to find that usually it's by

00:07:25.240 --> 00:07:27.839 
you'd have to find that usually it's by
a<00:07:25.270> hose<00:07:25.599> bib<00:07:25.990> but<00:07:26.409> it<00:07:26.530> can<00:07:26.800> be<00:07:27.069> just<00:07:27.310> coming

00:07:27.839 --> 00:07:27.849 
a hose bib but it can be just coming

00:07:27.849 --> 00:07:30.960 
a hose bib but it can be just coming
into<00:07:28.120> the<00:07:28.270> house<00:07:28.770> through<00:07:29.770> from<00:07:30.159> the<00:07:30.490> water

00:07:30.960 --> 00:07:30.970 
into the house through from the water

00:07:30.970 --> 00:07:35.339 
into the house through from the water
meter<00:07:31.389> so<00:07:32.319> hope<00:07:32.680> that<00:07:32.740> helps<00:07:32.949> if<00:07:33.610> it<00:07:33.849> does<00:07:34.349> give

00:07:35.339 --> 00:07:35.349 
meter so hope that helps if it does give

00:07:35.349 --> 00:07:38.460 
meter so hope that helps if it does give
