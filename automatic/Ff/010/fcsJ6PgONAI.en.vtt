00:01:54.960 --> 00:01:58.280 
station and and you're good to go
so<00:01:55.880> that's<00:01:56.880> how<00:01:57.149> the<00:01:57.210> set<00:01:57.689> up<00:01:57.810> is<00:01:57.930> for<00:01:58.200> the

00:01:58.280 --> 00:01:58.290 
so that's how the set up is for the

00:01:58.290 --> 00:02:00.260 
so that's how the set up is for the
space<00:01:58.500> station<00:01:58.799> on<00:01:58.950> Android<00:01:59.340> now<00:01:59.520> I<00:01:59.759> always

00:02:00.260 --> 00:02:00.270 
space station on Android now I always

00:02:00.270 --> 00:02:02.510 
space station on Android now I always
app<00:02:00.540> I<00:02:00.689> think<00:02:00.719> is<00:02:01.079> much<00:02:01.350> better<00:02:01.590> better

00:02:02.510 --> 00:02:02.520 
app I think is much better better

00:02:02.520 --> 00:02:05.539 
app I think is much better better
organized<00:02:02.939> I<00:02:03.210> performed<00:02:04.140> me<00:02:04.229> anyway<00:02:04.560> so

00:02:05.539 --> 00:02:05.549 
organized I performed me anyway so

00:02:05.549 --> 00:02:07.340 
organized I performed me anyway so
hopefully<00:02:05.700> they<00:02:06.030> will<00:02:06.210> improve<00:02:06.509> that<00:02:06.570> so<00:02:06.990> with

00:02:07.340 --> 00:02:07.350 
hopefully they will improve that so with

00:02:07.350 --> 00:02:08.930 
hopefully they will improve that so with
iOS<00:02:07.829> of<00:02:07.979> course<00:02:08.190> you<00:02:08.340> just<00:02:08.369> make<00:02:08.729> sure<00:02:08.849> you

00:02:08.930 --> 00:02:08.940 
iOS of course you just make sure you

00:02:08.940 --> 00:02:10.340 
iOS of course you just make sure you
need<00:02:09.090> to<00:02:09.119> connect<00:02:09.479> your<00:02:09.539> lightning<00:02:10.020> cable

00:02:10.340 --> 00:02:10.350 
need to connect your lightning cable

00:02:10.350 --> 00:02:14.150 
need to connect your lightning cable
to<00:02:11.160> it<00:02:11.310> and<00:02:11.580> you<00:02:12.090> plug<00:02:12.360> that<00:02:12.420> in<00:02:12.930> and<00:02:13.170> once

00:02:14.150 --> 00:02:14.160 
to it and you plug that in and once

00:02:14.160 --> 00:02:16.310 
to it and you plug that in and once
that's<00:02:14.340> up<00:02:14.790> and<00:02:15.030> running<00:02:15.090> you<00:02:15.810> should<00:02:16.080> be<00:02:16.230> able

00:02:16.310 --> 00:02:16.320 
that's up and running you should be able

00:02:16.320 --> 00:02:20.510 
that's up and running you should be able
to<00:02:16.910> access<00:02:17.910> it<00:02:18.240> with<00:02:18.450> a<00:02:18.510> space<00:02:18.810> app<00:02:19.370> get<00:02:20.370> out

00:02:20.510 --> 00:02:20.520 
to access it with a space app get out

00:02:20.520 --> 00:02:23.000 
to access it with a space app get out
there<00:02:20.760> hit<00:02:20.880> the<00:02:20.970> space<00:02:21.210> outgoing<00:02:21.780> and<00:02:22.050> of

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:23.010 
there hit the space outgoing and of

00:02:23.010 --> 00:02:23.990 
there hit the space outgoing and of
course<00:02:23.250> I'm<00:02:23.370> just<00:02:23.430> going<00:02:23.640> to<00:02:23.700> drop<00:02:23.820> my
