00:00:07.650 --> 00:00:12.610
 hello friends how are you talking fars and 

00:00:10.269 --> 00:00:15.759
 kayte and in this video I'm going to show you 

00:00:12.610 --> 00:00:18.160
 how is it that we can connect the spd 30 to 

00:00:15.759 --> 00:00:21.070
 a laptop or computer to be able to 

00:00:18.160 --> 00:00:23.710
 play sounds that we do not find in the 

00:00:21.070 --> 00:00:27.699
 SPD 30 can be folk styles 

00:00:23.710 --> 00:00:30.519
 cumes ureÃ±a or reggaeton even then 

00:00:27.699 --> 00:00:33.550
 Here I am going to show you why we are going to 

00:00:30.519 --> 00:00:37.239
 have good obviously here I have my spd 

00:00:33.550 --> 00:00:39.730
 30 I have a laptop and to connect this 

00:00:37.239 --> 00:00:42.460
 we're going to need a google cable 

00:00:39.730 --> 00:00:44.620
 see a thousand are these printer cables that 

00:00:42.460 --> 00:00:46.989
 connect to computers also from 

00:00:44.620 --> 00:00:50.460
 one side as you see is usb and the other side 

00:00:46.989 --> 00:00:53.739
 it's a square if you can notice it 

00:00:50.460 --> 00:00:57.399
 then I will know this this this 

00:00:53.739 --> 00:01:00.309
 USB side to the laptop I will connect this 

00:00:57.399 --> 00:01:02.460
 side to the SPD 30 in this part of 

00:01:00.309 --> 00:01:02.460
 here 

00:01:02.520 --> 00:01:05.090
 until 

00:01:06.690 --> 00:01:11.170
 and ready 

00:01:08.890 --> 00:01:16.540
 then once I have connected 

00:01:11.170 --> 00:01:18.369
 this cable I will start my laptop a 

00:01:16.540 --> 00:01:20.760
 well-known program that is called the 

00:01:18.369 --> 00:01:20.760
 drums 

00:01:21.930 --> 00:01:26.180
 eye that before starting the battery already 

00:01:24.300 --> 00:01:30.830
 it has to be connected to the cables 

00:01:26.180 --> 00:01:33.360
 ok then here I am going to download 

00:01:30.830 --> 00:01:35.910
 one 

00:01:33.360 --> 00:01:37.960
 in a programming that I already have made 

00:01:35.910 --> 00:01:40.650
 on the battery 

00:01:37.960 --> 00:01:40.650
 and has spent 

00:01:40.870 --> 00:01:56.060
 so in a way that I hit 

00:01:45.320 --> 00:02:02.210
 my spd 30 and finish in the battery that 

00:01:56.060 --> 00:02:06.250
 is reacting to the blow does not have 

00:02:02.210 --> 00:02:06.250
 delay there is no latency of your 

00:02:16.620 --> 00:02:24.030
 now that I have other kits already 

00:02:19.920 --> 00:02:24.030
 configured complete for folklore 

00:02:31.290 --> 00:02:37.819
 and I can also have planned on the 

00:02:34.079 --> 00:02:40.510
 toilet and the sounds as well as in the 

00:02:37.819 --> 00:02:44.439
 spd 30 

00:02:40.510 --> 00:02:50.549
 for example I'm going to load here in the 

00:02:44.439 --> 00:02:50.549
 battery a kit that I have previously made 

00:02:50.550 --> 00:02:55.430
 and we are going to see that here in this as 

00:02:53.070 --> 00:02:55.430
 revenue 

00:02:58.100 --> 00:03:01.460
 well 

00:02:59.490 --> 00:03:05.330
 saleh 

00:03:01.460 --> 00:03:08.550
 leaves a channel sideways to the geo channel and 

00:03:05.330 --> 00:03:12.660
 the other sounds 

00:03:08.550 --> 00:03:15.330
 the hay come out 

00:03:12.660 --> 00:03:17.780
 units systems in the east of 30 of 

00:03:15.330 --> 00:03:17.780
 the expedition 

00:03:17.920 --> 00:03:21.630
 for example that I have a kit and folklore 

00:03:27.420 --> 00:03:30.770
 and we're going to give it to him 

00:03:32.280 --> 00:03:36.930
 also in the mixer can I give it 

00:03:34.650 --> 00:03:39.959
 freedom to the soundman because I'm going to 

00:03:36.930 --> 00:03:44.600
 download this channel from here to 0 that I have left 

00:03:39.959 --> 00:03:44.600
 the hype does not sound then finish them 

00:03:45.740 --> 00:03:50.660
 a saucer does not sound then in this 

00:03:49.130 --> 00:03:53.270
 kind of situations what I do is 

00:03:50.660 --> 00:03:54.770
 invest the tournament I already have this 

00:03:53.270 --> 00:03:58.220
 saucer although not usually be 

00:03:54.770 --> 00:04:00.950
 in the club commanding the r side 

00:03:58.220 --> 00:04:03.790
 if you can see it 

00:04:00.950 --> 00:04:03.790
 so 

00:04:06.560 --> 00:04:12.210
 for iu some little noises when 

00:04:09.080 --> 00:04:15.450
 you hear some little noises keep on I know 

00:04:12.210 --> 00:04:18.450
 the acid out of the in the driver go 

00:04:15.450 --> 00:04:20.250
 up to him slowly so you do not have 

00:04:18.450 --> 00:04:22.200
 interference that kind of noise those 

00:04:20.250 --> 00:04:24.030
 for the processing that is doing 

00:04:22.200 --> 00:04:26.540
 of the audio so you do not have delays 

00:04:24.030 --> 00:04:26.540
 hit 

00:04:29.740 --> 00:04:36.030
 Colpisa the hype and is not leaving the 

00:04:32.440 --> 00:04:36.030
 sound is because in the mixer 

00:04:36.200 --> 00:04:40.650
 now if I had them 

00:04:38.730 --> 00:04:44.720
 this one here that is the bass drum and under this 

00:04:40.650 --> 00:04:44.720
 of the toms is there yes 

00:04:46.080 --> 00:04:48.979
 in the wind 

00:04:49.210 --> 00:04:55.840
 here also in SPD 30 can have a 

00:04:52.090 --> 00:04:58.690
 optional hype so that it sounds like 

00:04:55.840 --> 00:05:01.919
 spd 30 but I do not know anything then 

00:04:58.690 --> 00:05:01.919
 issues when programming 

00:05:01.950 --> 00:05:07.470
 and mittens let's not be ducks and sounds 

00:05:05.130 --> 00:05:09.840
 expanded that I'm taking out of why 

00:05:07.470 --> 00:05:12.200
 because the volume in the 

00:05:09.840 --> 00:05:16.360
 mix now apparent hype 

00:05:12.200 --> 00:05:18.760
 if it sounds explains the battery these things 

00:05:16.360 --> 00:05:22.450
 so 

00:05:18.760 --> 00:05:25.420
 it is clear that it can be planned 

00:05:22.450 --> 00:05:28.870
 and thus give the soundman freedom to 

00:05:25.420 --> 00:05:33.040
 make the independent mix of 

00:05:28.870 --> 00:05:34.900
 hype and tones using a laptop but if 

00:05:33.040 --> 00:05:37.330
 It is applied in all cabling by 

00:05:34.900 --> 00:05:39.670
 suddenly, then suddenly 

00:05:37.330 --> 00:05:41.800
 it's pretty not quite gentlemen 

00:05:39.670 --> 00:05:44.830
 maybe it's a little bit more just a little 

00:05:41.800 --> 00:05:47.110
 complicated to do this but the most 

00:05:44.830 --> 00:05:50.950
 appropriate that I suggest is that 

00:05:47.110 --> 00:05:55.600
 count on a sampler esp of ss xo 

00:05:50.950 --> 00:05:58.700
 12 multi yamaha and so can be avoided 

00:05:55.600 --> 00:06:00.950
 all this mess of pots with cables 

00:05:58.700 --> 00:06:02.360
 and they can have more freedom because 

00:06:00.950 --> 00:06:04.130
 We will employ can put all kinds 

00:06:02.360 --> 00:06:07.020
 sounds that you might not find 

00:06:04.130 --> 00:06:09.629
 in the spd 30 

00:06:07.020 --> 00:06:12.030
 the idea is that they can complement and not 

00:06:09.629 --> 00:06:14.460
 limit yourself I'm sure you guys do 

00:06:12.030 --> 00:06:16.590
 can have one more sampler for 

00:06:14.460 --> 00:06:20.900
 complement an esp of 30 as a 

00:06:16.590 --> 00:06:23.639
 sampler sx sps or multi 2 of yamaha 

00:06:20.900 --> 00:06:26.370
 then this is all for now they can 

00:06:23.639 --> 00:06:28.289
 leave me your doubts comments and 

00:06:26.370 --> 00:06:30.930
 concerns you have regarding this 

00:06:28.289 --> 00:06:35.930
 video and other videos that they want more 

00:06:30.930 --> 00:06:35.930
 what are you doing so I'll see you bye 

00:06:39.110 --> 00:06:42.110
