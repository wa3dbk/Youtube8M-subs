00:00:05.269 --> 00:00:05.279 
and a half ass tube stage with the boost

00:00:05.279 --> 00:00:07.190 
and a half ass tube stage with the boost
so<00:00:05.700> and<00:00:05.970> it's<00:00:06.060> a<00:00:06.150> fixed<00:00:06.569> there's<00:00:07.049> no

00:00:07.190 --> 00:00:07.200 
so and it's a fixed there's no

00:00:07.200 --> 00:00:09.589 
so and it's a fixed there's no
adjustment<00:00:07.710> inside<00:00:08.040> for<00:00:08.340> it<00:00:08.460> and<00:00:08.700> then<00:00:09.389> on<00:00:09.480> the

00:00:09.589 --> 00:00:09.599 
adjustment inside for it and then on the

00:00:09.599 --> 00:00:11.120 
adjustment inside for it and then on the
back<00:00:09.750> the<00:00:10.019> other<00:00:10.050> control<00:00:10.559> on<00:00:10.650> the<00:00:10.740> back<00:00:10.920> is

00:00:11.120 --> 00:00:11.130 
back the other control on the back is

00:00:11.130 --> 00:00:15.049 
back the other control on the back is
feedback<00:00:11.849> so<00:00:12.780> you<00:00:12.870> can<00:00:13.139> go<00:00:13.639> we<00:00:14.639> can<00:00:14.790> kind<00:00:14.940> of

00:00:15.049 --> 00:00:15.059 
feedback so you can go we can kind of

00:00:15.059 --> 00:00:24.380 
feedback so you can go we can kind of
get<00:00:15.210> a<00:00:15.240> row<00:00:15.420> square<00:00:16.520> deal

00:00:24.380 --> 00:00:24.390 

00:00:24.390 --> 00:00:27.180 

like<00:00:25.390> Marshall<00:00:26.020> feedback<00:00:26.320> basically<00:00:27.040> right

00:00:27.180 --> 00:00:27.190 
like Marshall feedback basically right

00:00:27.190 --> 00:00:30.150 
like Marshall feedback basically right
there<00:00:27.630> we<00:00:28.680> leave<00:00:29.680> it<00:00:29.800> in<00:00:29.890> the<00:00:29.950> halfway

00:00:30.150 --> 00:00:30.160 
there we leave it in the halfway

00:00:30.160 --> 00:00:37.620 
there we leave it in the halfway
position<00:00:35.460> it's<00:00:36.460> a<00:00:36.580> center<00:00:36.910> detent<00:00:37.330> and<00:00:37.510> then

00:00:37.620 --> 00:00:37.630 
position it's a center detent and then

00:00:37.630 --> 00:00:38.880 
position it's a center detent and then
you<00:00:37.720> can<00:00:37.930> you<00:00:38.050> can<00:00:38.170> go<00:00:38.260> farther<00:00:38.559> than<00:00:38.830> that

00:00:38.880 --> 00:00:38.890 
you can you can go farther than that

00:00:38.890 --> 00:00:42.110 
you can you can go farther than that
which<00:00:39.250> is<00:00:39.280> a<00:00:39.670> lot<00:00:40.120> more<00:00:40.150> modern<00:00:40.840> a<00:00:41.080> lot<00:00:41.559> more

00:00:42.110 --> 00:00:42.120 
which is a lot more modern a lot more

00:00:42.120 --> 00:00:52.130 
which is a lot more modern a lot more
articulate

00:00:52.130 --> 00:00:52.140 

00:00:52.140 --> 00:00:55.670 

kind<00:00:53.100> of<00:00:53.160> a<00:00:53.250> quicker<00:00:53.520> attack<00:00:53.940> so<00:00:54.630> you<00:00:54.690> know<00:00:55.020> get

00:00:55.670 --> 00:00:55.680 
kind of a quicker attack so you know get

00:00:55.680 --> 00:00:57.139 
kind of a quicker attack so you know get
very<00:00:55.710> the<00:00:56.100> attack<00:00:56.370> of<00:00:56.520> the<00:00:56.579> power<00:00:56.730> section

00:00:57.139 --> 00:00:57.149 
very the attack of the power section

00:00:57.149 --> 00:01:00.049 
very the attack of the power section
that<00:00:57.300> way<00:00:57.420> to<00:00:58.309> what<00:00:59.309> kind<00:00:59.460> of<00:00:59.489> spoons<00:00:59.879> on<00:00:59.970> the

00:01:00.049 --> 00:01:00.059 
that way to what kind of spoons on the

00:01:00.059 --> 00:01:02.000 
that way to what kind of spoons on the
tooth<00:01:00.239> tub<00:01:00.480> that's<00:01:00.870> be<00:01:01.110> 30s<00:01:01.530> in<00:01:01.680> there<00:01:01.829> it

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:02.010 
tooth tub that's be 30s in there it

00:01:02.010 --> 00:01:04.549 
tooth tub that's be 30s in there it
sounds<00:01:02.280> really<00:01:02.400> good<00:01:02.610> for<00:01:02.820> greenbacks<00:01:03.300> too<00:01:03.629> I

00:01:04.549 --> 00:01:04.559 
sounds really good for greenbacks too I

00:01:04.559 --> 00:01:07.070 
sounds really good for greenbacks too I
just<00:01:05.400> kind<00:01:05.610> of<00:01:05.700> slow<00:01:06.330> over<00:01:06.720> here<00:01:06.780> Oh<00:01:06.960> Sam

everything<00:01:10.650> seems<00:01:10.890> with<00:01:11.100> computer<00:01:11.580> cabinet

00:01:11.900 --> 00:01:11.910 
everything seems with computer cabinet

00:01:11.910 --> 00:01:13.510 
everything seems with computer cabinet
to<00:01:12.210> we<00:01:12.390> were<00:01:12.450> up<00:01:12.660> screwing<00:01:12.990> around<00:01:13.110> with<00:01:13.350> the

00:01:13.510 --> 00:01:13.520 
to we were up screwing around with the

00:01:13.520 --> 00:01:16.730 
to we were up screwing around with the
212<00:01:14.520> but<00:01:15.509> and<00:01:15.869> then<00:01:15.990> you<00:01:16.080> have<00:01:16.200> an<00:01:16.320> effective

00:01:16.730 --> 00:01:16.740 
212 but and then you have an effective

00:01:16.740 --> 00:01:19.570 
212 but and then you have an effective
on<00:01:16.950> the<00:01:16.979> back<00:01:17.220> you<00:01:17.550> know<00:01:17.640> that's<00:01:17.970> switchable

00:01:19.570 --> 00:01:19.580 
on the back you know that's switchable

00:01:19.580 --> 00:01:22.040 
on the back you know that's switchable
you<00:01:20.580> know<00:01:20.729> is<00:01:21.030> the<00:01:21.210> other<00:01:21.330> thing<00:01:21.420> I<00:01:21.659> knew<00:01:21.930> in

00:01:22.040 --> 00:01:22.050 
you know is the other thing I knew in

00:01:22.050 --> 00:01:24.370 
you know is the other thing I knew in
the<00:01:22.170> effects<00:01:22.470> loop<00:01:22.710> I<00:01:23.009> like<00:01:23.490> it<00:01:23.729> is<00:01:23.909> you<00:01:24.090> can

00:01:24.370 --> 00:01:24.380 
the effects loop I like it is you can

00:01:24.380 --> 00:01:26.330 
the effects loop I like it is you can
activate<00:01:25.380> the<00:01:25.590> effect<00:01:25.649> sleep<00:01:26.070> with<00:01:26.220> the

00:01:26.330 --> 00:01:26.340 
activate the effect sleep with the

00:01:26.340 --> 00:01:28.160 
activate the effect sleep with the
switch<00:01:26.640> and<00:01:26.940> use<00:01:27.149> that<00:01:27.180> as<00:01:27.420> a<00:01:27.570> master<00:01:27.840> volume

00:01:28.160 --> 00:01:28.170 
switch and use that as a master volume

00:01:28.170 --> 00:01:30.230 
switch and use that as a master volume
reached<00:01:28.530> here<00:01:28.860> all<00:01:29.039> night<00:01:29.250> and<00:01:29.399> way<00:01:29.610> down<00:01:29.910> are

trying to hear how that changes the

00:02:05.840 --> 00:02:09.639 
trying to hear how that changes the
ambry<00:02:06.560> acts<00:02:06.740> and<00:02:07.160> if<00:02:07.250> I<00:02:07.340> take<00:02:07.550> it<00:02:07.580> out<00:02:07.790> and<00:02:08.649> come

ambry acts and if I take it out and come
back<00:02:09.680> down<00:02:09.830> to<00:02:10.190> that<00:02:10.340> volume

00:02:19.520 --> 00:02:19.530 

00:02:19.530 --> 00:02:22.580 

as<00:02:20.190> more<00:02:20.850> myth<00:02:21.060> yeah<00:02:21.360> well<00:02:21.780> it<00:02:22.050> kind<00:02:22.290> of<00:02:22.350> found

00:02:22.580 --> 00:02:22.590 
as more myth yeah well it kind of found

00:02:22.590 --> 00:02:23.720 
as more myth yeah well it kind of found
out<00:02:22.860> because<00:02:23.100> what<00:02:23.280> you're<00:02:23.370> doing<00:02:23.430> is<00:02:23.670> you're

00:02:23.720 --> 00:02:23.730 
out because what you're doing is you're

00:02:23.730 --> 00:02:25.550 
out because what you're doing is you're
pushing<00:02:24.209> more<00:02:24.390> into<00:02:24.600> the<00:02:24.720> power<00:02:24.900> section<00:02:25.410> and

00:02:25.550 --> 00:02:25.560 
pushing more into the power section and

00:02:25.560 --> 00:02:27.980 
pushing more into the power section and
then<00:02:26.069> you're<00:02:26.220> you're<00:02:26.610> basically<00:02:27.480> that<00:02:27.720> that

00:02:27.980 --> 00:02:27.990 
then you're you're basically that that

00:02:27.990 --> 00:02:31.550 
then you're you're basically that that
return<00:02:28.410> is<00:02:28.620> your<00:02:28.800> master<00:02:29.040> after<00:02:29.730> all<00:02:30.240> this<00:02:30.720> so

00:02:31.550 --> 00:02:31.560 
return is your master after all this so

00:02:31.560 --> 00:02:34.490 
return is your master after all this so
it<00:02:31.680> becomes<00:02:31.920> your<00:02:32.130> last<00:02:32.370> master<00:02:33.260> you<00:02:34.260> push

00:02:34.490 --> 00:02:34.500 
it becomes your last master you push

00:02:34.500 --> 00:02:37.490 
it becomes your last master you push
more<00:02:34.770> into<00:02:34.950> the<00:02:35.040> phase<00:02:35.250> inverter<00:02:35.640> and<00:02:36.500> you

00:02:37.490 --> 00:02:37.500 
more into the phase inverter and you

00:02:37.500 --> 00:02:42.500 
more into the phase inverter and you
know<00:02:37.670> so<00:02:38.670> kind<00:02:39.630> of<00:02:39.750> the<00:02:40.670> quick<00:02:41.670> demo<00:02:41.880> do<00:02:42.390> you

00:02:42.500 --> 00:02:42.510 
know so kind of the quick demo do you

00:02:42.510 --> 00:02:45.410 
know so kind of the quick demo do you
guys<00:02:42.630> clues<00:02:43.020> GoPro<00:02:43.790> it's<00:02:44.790> awful<00:02:45.090> switchable

00:02:45.410 --> 00:02:45.420 
guys clues GoPro it's awful switchable

00:02:45.420 --> 00:02:48.070 
guys clues GoPro it's awful switchable
so<00:02:45.810> can<00:02:46.410> have<00:02:46.560> it<00:02:46.680> all<00:02:46.770> down<00:02:47.040> on<00:02:47.069> the<00:02:47.310> switch
