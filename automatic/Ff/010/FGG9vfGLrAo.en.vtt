00:00:57.200 --> 00:00:57.210 
one of the better you know if you were

00:00:57.210 --> 00:01:00.349 
one of the better you know if you were
to<00:00:57.539> put<00:00:57.690> together<00:00:58.020> a<00:00:58.109> couple<00:00:58.969> couple<00:00:59.969> teams<00:01:00.149> to

00:01:00.349 --> 00:01:00.359 
to put together a couple couple teams to

00:01:00.359 --> 00:01:02.209 
to put together a couple couple teams to
keep<00:01:00.539> create<00:01:00.899> for<00:01:01.140> some<00:01:01.350> some<00:01:01.739> entertainment

keep create for some some entertainment
even<00:01:03.210> the<00:01:03.270> casual<00:01:03.629> football<00:01:04.019> fan<00:01:04.199> it<00:01:04.439> just

00:01:04.640 --> 00:01:04.650 
even the casual football fan it just

00:01:04.650 --> 00:01:06.380 
even the casual football fan it just
might<00:01:04.769> be<00:01:04.830> one<00:01:05.040> of<00:01:05.129> the<00:01:05.189> better<00:01:05.369> I<00:01:05.729> think<00:01:06.180> so

00:01:06.380 --> 00:01:06.390 
might be one of the better I think so

00:01:06.390 --> 00:01:08.210 
might be one of the better I think so
one<00:01:06.720> of<00:01:06.810> the<00:01:06.869> things<00:01:06.960> that<00:01:07.080> we<00:01:07.290> do<00:01:07.530> is<00:01:07.770> we<00:01:08.070> try

00:01:08.210 --> 00:01:08.220 
one of the things that we do is we try

00:01:08.220 --> 00:01:11.270 
one of the things that we do is we try
to<00:01:08.310> find<00:01:08.580> those<00:01:08.729> unique<00:01:09.090> matchups<00:01:10.070> teams<00:01:11.070> if

00:01:11.270 --> 00:01:11.280 
to find those unique matchups teams if

00:01:11.280 --> 00:01:12.830 
to find those unique matchups teams if
you<00:01:11.400> have<00:01:11.490> the<00:01:11.549> opportunity<00:01:11.610> for<00:01:12.119> 22<00:01:12.630> teams

00:01:12.830 --> 00:01:12.840 
you have the opportunity for 22 teams

00:01:12.840 --> 00:01:15.950 
you have the opportunity for 22 teams
together<00:01:13.820> that<00:01:14.820> the<00:01:14.939> fans<00:01:15.150> want<00:01:15.420> to<00:01:15.479> see<00:01:15.540> that

00:01:15.950 --> 00:01:15.960 
together that the fans want to see that

00:01:15.960 --> 00:01:18.469 
together that the fans want to see that
would<00:01:16.049> be<00:01:16.110> very<00:01:16.229> exciting<00:01:16.520> a<00:01:17.520> lot<00:01:18.119> of<00:01:18.150> times

00:01:18.469 --> 00:01:18.479 
would be very exciting a lot of times

00:01:18.479 --> 00:01:20.300 
would be very exciting a lot of times
the<00:01:18.900> Bulls<00:01:19.080> have<00:01:19.170> an<00:01:19.350> opportunity<00:01:19.590> to<00:01:19.979> do<00:01:20.159> that

00:01:20.300 --> 00:01:20.310 
the Bulls have an opportunity to do that

00:01:20.310 --> 00:01:23.179 
the Bulls have an opportunity to do that
sometimes<00:01:20.790> we<00:01:21.030> don't<00:01:21.180> this<00:01:21.450> time<00:01:21.720> we<00:01:21.960> did<00:01:22.189> both

00:01:23.179 --> 00:01:23.189 
sometimes we don't this time we did both

00:01:23.189 --> 00:01:25.429 
sometimes we don't this time we did both
teams<00:01:23.549> basically<00:01:24.390> averaging<00:01:24.540> over<00:01:24.869> 30<00:01:25.110> points

00:01:25.429 --> 00:01:25.439 
teams basically averaging over 30 points

00:01:25.439 --> 00:01:28.789 
teams basically averaging over 30 points
over<00:01:25.920> 400<00:01:26.310> yards<00:01:26.490> a<00:01:26.549> game<00:01:27.350> and<00:01:28.350> obvious

00:01:28.789 --> 00:01:28.799 
over 400 yards a game and obvious

00:01:28.799 --> 00:01:31.190 
over 400 yards a game and obvious
programs<00:01:29.250> that<00:01:29.369> are<00:01:29.460> very<00:01:29.659> very<00:01:30.659> good<00:01:30.869> so<00:01:31.110> they

00:01:31.190 --> 00:01:31.200 
programs that are very very good so they

00:01:31.200 --> 00:01:33.440 
programs that are very very good so they
behind<00:01:31.350> of<00:01:31.500> fireworks<00:01:31.890> out<00:01:32.670> of<00:01:32.820> offense<00:01:33.240> and

00:01:33.440 --> 00:01:33.450 
behind of fireworks out of offense and

00:01:33.450 --> 00:01:35.600 
behind of fireworks out of offense and
very<00:01:34.259> well<00:01:34.439> could<00:01:34.619> come<00:01:34.799> down<00:01:34.979> to<00:01:35.250> who<00:01:35.430> has<00:01:35.579> the

00:01:35.600 --> 00:01:35.610 
very well could come down to who has the

00:01:35.610 --> 00:01:37.039 
very well could come down to who has the
ball<00:01:35.850> last<00:01:36.090> and<00:01:36.390> then<00:01:36.509> in<00:01:36.600> the<00:01:36.659> fourth<00:01:36.810> quarter

00:01:37.039 --> 00:01:37.049 
ball last and then in the fourth quarter

00:01:37.049 --> 00:01:38.929 
ball last and then in the fourth quarter
so<00:01:37.380> we<00:01:37.500> think<00:01:37.650> that<00:01:37.770> be<00:01:38.040> it's<00:01:38.579> a<00:01:38.700> very

00:01:38.929 --> 00:01:38.939 
so we think that be it's a very

00:01:38.939 --> 00:01:41.899 
so we think that be it's a very
compelling<00:01:39.659> a<00:01:40.020> story<00:01:40.770> very<00:01:41.220> compelling<00:01:41.700> game

00:01:41.899 --> 00:01:41.909 
compelling a story very compelling game

00:01:41.909 --> 00:01:43.639 
compelling a story very compelling game
and<00:01:42.180> we<00:01:42.299> think<00:01:42.509> of<00:01:42.600> a<00:01:42.720> very<00:01:42.990> very<00:01:43.200> exciting<00:01:43.560> for

00:01:43.639 --> 00:01:43.649 
and we think of a very very exciting for

00:01:43.649 --> 00:01:45.350 
and we think of a very very exciting for
the<00:01:43.740> fans<00:01:43.770> no<00:01:44.159> question<00:01:44.460> about<00:01:44.520> it<00:01:44.670> with<00:01:45.090> sort

00:01:45.350 --> 00:01:45.360 
the fans no question about it with sort

00:01:45.360 --> 00:01:47.660 
the fans no question about it with sort
of<00:01:45.450> food<00:01:45.659> who<00:01:45.930> slotted<00:01:46.380> for<00:01:46.530> you<00:01:46.829> guys<00:01:47.040> with

the<00:01:47.790> ACC<00:01:48.299> and<00:01:48.329> the<00:01:49.170> Big<00:01:49.829> East<00:01:50.040> you<00:01:50.670> guys<00:01:50.850> I

00:01:51.170 --> 00:01:51.180 
the ACC and the Big East you guys I

00:01:51.180 --> 00:01:53.899 
the ACC and the Big East you guys I
would<00:01:51.960> think<00:01:52.110> after<00:01:52.649> say<00:01:53.399> at<00:01:53.520> Virginia<00:01:53.850> Tech

00:01:53.899 --> 00:01:53.909 
would think after say at Virginia Tech

00:01:53.909 --> 00:01:55.310 
would think after say at Virginia Tech
Cincinnati<00:01:54.450> match<00:01:54.659> up<00:01:54.810> a<00:01:54.869> couple<00:01:55.020> years<00:01:55.259> ago

00:01:55.310 --> 00:01:55.320 
Cincinnati match up a couple years ago

00:01:55.320 --> 00:01:56.330 
Cincinnati match up a couple years ago
this<00:01:55.560> has<00:01:55.740> to<00:01:55.860> look<00:01:55.979> awfully<00:01:56.280> appealing

00:01:56.330 --> 00:01:56.340 
this has to look awfully appealing

00:01:56.340 --> 00:01:58.100 
this has to look awfully appealing
simply<00:01:57.000> because<00:01:57.210> the<00:01:57.360> fan<00:01:57.509> base<00:01:57.719> is<00:01:57.899> if<00:01:58.020> I

00:01:58.100 --> 00:01:58.110 
simply because the fan base is if I

00:01:58.110 --> 00:02:00.499 
simply because the fan base is if I
would<00:01:58.229> assume<00:01:58.439> well<00:01:58.799> it<00:01:59.159> does<00:01:59.700> but<00:02:00.119> obviously

00:02:00.499 --> 00:02:00.509 
would assume well it does but obviously

00:02:00.509 --> 00:02:03.350 
would assume well it does but obviously
we<00:02:00.659> have<00:02:00.750> at<00:02:00.869> the<00:02:01.140> eighth<00:02:01.290> time<00:02:01.560> again<00:02:01.890> CC

00:02:03.350 --> 00:02:03.360 
we have at the eighth time again CC

00:02:03.360 --> 00:02:05.600 
we have at the eighth time again CC
and<00:02:03.510> a<00:02:03.540> large<00:02:03.990> birth<00:02:04.290> but<00:02:04.980> there's<00:02:05.400> an

00:02:05.600 --> 00:02:05.610 
and a large birth but there's an

00:02:05.610 --> 00:02:07.550 
and a large birth but there's an
all-night<00:02:06.210> qualifiers<00:02:06.840> you<00:02:06.990> know<00:02:07.110> not<00:02:07.350> on

00:02:07.550 --> 00:02:07.560 
all-night qualifiers you know not on

00:02:07.560 --> 00:02:09.200 
all-night qualifiers you know not on
that<00:02:07.740> qualifiers<00:02:08.250> but<00:02:08.369> obviously<00:02:08.850> there's<00:02:09.090> a

00:02:09.200 --> 00:02:09.210 
that qualifiers but obviously there's a

00:02:09.210 --> 00:02:12.380 
that qualifiers but obviously there's a
list<00:02:09.390> of<00:02:09.570> teams<00:02:10.370> are<00:02:11.370> more<00:02:11.850> than<00:02:12.030> the<00:02:12.150> slides

00:02:12.380 --> 00:02:12.390 
list of teams are more than the slides

list of teams are more than the slides
are<00:02:12.570> available<00:02:12.720> so<00:02:13.260> to<00:02:13.320> the<00:02:13.560> extent<00:02:13.920> that<00:02:14.040> we

00:02:14.270 --> 00:02:14.280 
are available so to the extent that we

00:02:14.280 --> 00:02:15.710 
are available so to the extent that we
can<00:02:14.310> as<00:02:14.550> I<00:02:14.640> mentioned<00:02:14.940> before<00:02:14.970> that<00:02:15.240> we<00:02:15.570> can

00:02:15.710 --> 00:02:15.720 
can as I mentioned before that we can

00:02:15.720 --> 00:02:17.960 
can as I mentioned before that we can
try<00:02:15.930> and<00:02:15.960> put<00:02:16.200> together<00:02:16.500> that<00:02:17.190> unique<00:02:17.550> matchup

00:02:17.960 --> 00:02:17.970 
try and put together that unique matchup

00:02:17.970 --> 00:02:19.970 
try and put together that unique matchup
and<00:02:18.240> how<00:02:18.750> we<00:02:18.810> do<00:02:19.200> that<00:02:19.380> is<00:02:19.440> a<00:02:19.620> lot<00:02:19.710> of<00:02:19.770> times

00:02:19.970 --> 00:02:19.980 
and how we do that is a lot of times

00:02:19.980 --> 00:02:21.230 
and how we do that is a lot of times
during<00:02:20.130> the<00:02:20.280> year<00:02:20.340> we<00:02:20.610> will<00:02:20.730> travel<00:02:20.760> obviously

00:02:21.230 --> 00:02:21.240 
during the year we will travel obviously

00:02:21.240 --> 00:02:23.240 
during the year we will travel obviously
to<00:02:21.720> various<00:02:22.050> games<00:02:22.320> throughout<00:02:22.590> the<00:02:22.710> year<00:02:23.070> it

get an idea as to kind of what-if

00:02:29.820 --> 00:02:31.730 
get an idea as to kind of what-if
scenarios<00:02:30.390> if<00:02:30.570> you<00:02:30.690> will<00:02:30.900> so<00:02:31.170> it<00:02:31.290> doesn't<00:02:31.590> mean

00:02:31.730 --> 00:02:31.740 
scenarios if you will so it doesn't mean

00:02:31.740 --> 00:02:34.070 
scenarios if you will so it doesn't mean
that<00:02:31.980> they<00:02:32.130> were<00:02:32.250> able<00:02:32.520> to<00:02:32.640> pull<00:02:33.300> that<00:02:33.540> off<00:02:33.570> but

00:03:19.430 --> 00:03:19.440 
couple down weeks but we knew that was
