pressure pads are like all the way

00:00:23.580 --> 00:00:24.950 
pressure pads are like all the way
through<00:00:23.820> down<00:00:24.000> apart<00:00:24.300> from<00:00:24.420> the<00:00:24.570> bridge<00:00:24.779> that

00:00:51.560 --> 00:00:51.570 
of fireworks and going all the way down

00:00:51.570 --> 00:00:54.439 
of fireworks and going all the way down
saying<00:00:52.110> or<00:00:52.260> fireworks<00:00:52.739> that's<00:00:53.579> pretty<00:00:54.300> cool

00:00:54.439 --> 00:00:54.449 
saying or fireworks that's pretty cool

00:00:54.449 --> 00:00:56.540 
saying or fireworks that's pretty cool
this<00:00:55.110> is<00:00:55.230> only<00:00:55.320> the<00:00:55.530> first<00:00:55.710> part<00:00:56.039> of<00:00:56.219> the

00:00:56.540 --> 00:00:56.550 
this is only the first part of the

00:00:56.550 --> 00:00:58.720 
this is only the first part of the
firework<00:00:57.449> display<00:00:57.750> and<00:00:57.989> now<00:00:58.170> this<00:00:58.379> is<00:00:58.530> the

00:00:58.720 --> 00:00:58.730 
firework display and now this is the

00:00:58.730 --> 00:01:01.130 
firework display and now this is the
next<00:00:59.730> part<00:00:59.879> for<00:01:00.149> the<00:01:00.480> bridge<00:01:00.719> were<00:01:00.930> like

00:01:01.130 --> 00:01:01.140 
next part for the bridge were like

00:01:01.140 --> 00:01:02.240 
next part for the bridge were like
thinking<00:01:01.410> or<00:01:01.559> we<00:01:01.649> could<00:01:01.800> just<00:01:01.829> make<00:01:01.949> pressure

00:01:02.240 --> 00:01:02.250 
thinking or we could just make pressure

00:01:02.250 --> 00:01:03.380 
thinking or we could just make pressure
pads<00:01:02.520> all<00:01:02.640> the<00:01:02.699> way<00:01:02.789> down<00:01:02.940> or<00:01:03.120> we<00:01:03.180> could<00:01:03.300> do

00:01:03.380 --> 00:01:03.390 
pads all the way down or we could do

00:01:03.390 --> 00:01:04.670 
pads all the way down or we could do
something<00:01:03.420> cool<00:01:03.870> that<00:01:04.140> looks<00:01:04.229> even<00:01:04.530> cooler

00:01:04.670 --> 00:01:04.680 
something cool that looks even cooler

00:01:04.680 --> 00:01:07.340 
something cool that looks even cooler
and<00:01:04.979> looks<00:01:05.400> nicer<00:01:05.909> as<00:01:06.030> well<00:01:06.210> so<00:01:06.990> as<00:01:07.110> you<00:01:07.229> can

00:01:07.340 --> 00:01:07.350 
and looks nicer as well so as you can

00:01:07.350 --> 00:01:09.800 
and looks nicer as well so as you can
see<00:01:07.470> we've<00:01:07.619> for<00:01:08.610> the<00:01:08.700> last<00:01:09.060> pressure<00:01:09.360> pad<00:01:09.600> just

00:01:09.800 --> 00:01:09.810 
see we've for the last pressure pad just

00:01:09.810 --> 00:01:11.179 
see we've for the last pressure pad just
before<00:01:10.049> the<00:01:10.140> bridge<00:01:10.350> we<00:01:10.470> put<00:01:10.650> this<00:01:10.740> redstone

00:01:11.179 --> 00:01:11.189 
before the bridge we put this redstone

00:01:11.189 --> 00:01:12.950 
before the bridge we put this redstone
there<00:01:11.220> and<00:01:11.700> when<00:01:12.119> they<00:01:12.240> go<00:01:12.390> over<00:01:12.689> it<00:01:12.780> it's

00:01:12.950 --> 00:01:12.960 
there and when they go over it it's

00:01:12.960 --> 00:01:14.480 
there and when they go over it it's
gonna<00:01:13.080> set<00:01:13.320> off<00:01:13.409> these<00:01:13.530> chain<00:01:13.830> of<00:01:14.010> fireworks

00:01:30.440 --> 00:01:30.450 
can see they're shooting off so that's a

00:01:30.450 --> 00:01:32.569 
can see they're shooting off so that's a
pretty<00:01:30.659> it's<00:01:31.049> a<00:01:31.110> pretty<00:01:31.320> basic<00:01:31.560> setup<00:01:32.280> as<00:01:32.400> you

00:01:32.569 --> 00:01:32.579 
pretty it's a pretty basic setup as you

00:01:32.579 --> 00:01:34.100 
pretty it's a pretty basic setup as you
can<00:01:32.729> see<00:01:32.939> it<00:01:33.090> it<00:01:33.329> would<00:01:33.420> be<00:01:33.509> pretty<00:01:33.689> easy<00:01:33.810> to

00:01:34.100 --> 00:01:34.110 
can see it it would be pretty easy to

00:01:34.110 --> 00:01:36.890 
can see it it would be pretty easy to
just<00:01:34.140> copy<00:01:34.470> that<00:01:35.090> now<00:01:36.090> this<00:01:36.450> don't<00:01:36.659> need<00:01:36.750> the

00:01:36.890 --> 00:01:36.900 
just copy that now this don't need the

00:01:36.900 --> 00:01:39.950 
just copy that now this don't need the
