00:01:16.090 --> 00:01:16.100 
other light bars from them and then of

00:01:16.100 --> 00:01:18.880 
other light bars from them and then of
course<00:01:16.369> the<00:01:16.640> control<00:01:17.030> box<00:01:17.500> control<00:01:18.500> box<00:01:18.710> is

00:01:18.880 --> 00:01:18.890 
course the control box control box is

00:01:18.890 --> 00:01:24.700 
course the control box control box is
quite<00:01:19.100> bulky<00:01:20.409> but<00:01:22.720> you<00:01:23.720> know<00:01:23.840> what<00:01:24.590> do<00:01:24.649> you

00:01:24.700 --> 00:01:24.710 
quite bulky but you know what do you

00:01:24.710 --> 00:01:26.950 
quite bulky but you know what do you
expect<00:01:24.950> this<00:01:25.159> controls<00:01:25.610> all<00:01:25.759> your<00:01:26.030> your

00:01:26.950 --> 00:01:26.960 
expect this controls all your your

00:01:26.960 --> 00:01:28.539 
expect this controls all your your
functions<00:01:27.500> of<00:01:27.950> course<00:01:28.159> I<00:01:28.250> don't<00:01:28.399> have<00:01:28.490> a

00:01:28.539 --> 00:01:28.549 
functions of course I don't have a

00:01:28.549 --> 00:01:29.830 
functions of course I don't have a
mounted<00:01:28.909> permanently<00:01:29.329> yet<00:01:29.540> because<00:01:29.780> I

00:01:29.830 --> 00:01:29.840 
mounted permanently yet because I

00:01:29.840 --> 00:01:31.319 
mounted permanently yet because I
haven't<00:01:29.930> figured<00:01:30.290> out<00:01:30.350> a<00:01:30.409> good<00:01:30.619> spot<00:01:30.860> for<00:01:30.890> it

00:01:31.319 --> 00:01:31.329 
haven't figured out a good spot for it

00:01:31.329 --> 00:01:33.940 
haven't figured out a good spot for it
then<00:01:32.329> of<00:01:32.450> course<00:01:32.509> you're<00:01:32.780> off<00:01:32.899> and<00:01:33.619> on<00:01:33.680> switch

00:01:33.940 --> 00:01:33.950 
then of course you're off and on switch

00:01:33.950 --> 00:01:35.260 
then of course you're off and on switch
over<00:01:34.189> here<00:01:34.369> this<00:01:34.549> controls<00:01:34.939> all<00:01:35.060> your

00:01:35.260 --> 00:01:35.270 
over here this controls all your

00:01:35.270 --> 00:01:37.050 
over here this controls all your
functions<00:01:35.450> your<00:01:35.869> LEDs<00:01:36.259> telling<00:01:36.649> you<00:01:36.740> what

00:01:37.050 --> 00:01:37.060 
functions your LEDs telling you what

00:01:37.060 --> 00:01:41.260 
functions your LEDs telling you what
lights<00:01:38.060> are<00:01:38.240> struggling<00:01:38.600> right<00:01:38.630> now<00:01:40.270> right

00:01:41.260 --> 00:01:41.270 
lights are struggling right now right

00:01:41.270 --> 00:01:43.060 
lights are struggling right now right
now<00:01:41.299> it's<00:01:41.630> going<00:01:41.780> through<00:01:42.020> all<00:01:42.170> I<00:01:42.200> believe<00:01:42.409> 13

00:01:43.060 --> 00:01:43.070 
now it's going through all I believe 13

00:01:43.070 --> 00:01:45.459 
now it's going through all I believe 13
modes<00:01:43.340> I've<00:01:44.090> got<00:01:44.390> it<00:01:44.540> rigged<00:01:44.780> right<00:01:45.020> now<00:01:45.200> to<00:01:45.259> a

00:01:45.459 --> 00:01:45.469 
modes I've got it rigged right now to a

00:01:50.350 --> 00:01:50.360 
going to hardwire it in the world I have

00:01:50.360 --> 00:01:54.760 
going to hardwire it in the world I have
is<00:01:50.509> this<00:01:50.600> one<00:01:50.810> switch<00:01:51.079> to<00:01:51.289> worry<00:01:51.439> about<00:01:53.710> but<00:01:54.710> uh

00:01:54.760 --> 00:01:54.770 
is this one switch to worry about but uh
