00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.370
 what's up but I'm not ouija come see me 

00:00:03.449 --> 00:00:06.750
 a new video as is the title of 

00:00:05.370 --> 00:00:08.519
 explain how to get the beta 

00:00:06.750 --> 00:00:09.929
 battlefield 4 since a lot of people 

00:00:08.519 --> 00:00:12.000
 think that you can only get 

00:00:09.929 --> 00:00:13.889
 buying the pack of looks we are 

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:15.360
 watching right now but tell you there are 

00:00:13.889 --> 00:00:17.910
 two more ways to get it 

00:00:15.360 --> 00:00:19.770
 that we must explain and I will also say 

00:00:17.910 --> 00:00:21.840
 planned dates of both the beta and 

00:00:19.770 --> 00:00:23.430
 of the official game so let's go with the 

00:00:21.840 --> 00:00:25.859
 first way that is the most obvious 

00:00:23.430 --> 00:00:27.630
 We are in the official store of origin and 

00:00:25.859 --> 00:00:29.429
 As you can see we have two packs to buy the 

00:00:27.630 --> 00:00:32.009
 Standard version in the deluxe version 

00:00:29.429 --> 00:00:33.780
 where the difference is ten euros and 

00:00:32.009 --> 00:00:35.340
 in the deluxe version aside from getting 

00:00:33.780 --> 00:00:37.770
 exclusive access to the beta of 

00:00:35.340 --> 00:00:39.750
 battlefield 4 we will also have 

00:00:37.770 --> 00:00:41.129
 extra content that I honestly do not know 

00:00:39.750 --> 00:00:43.290
 what it was about, I suppose in a 

00:00:41.129 --> 00:00:45.930
 will already reveal information about the 

00:00:43.290 --> 00:00:47.700
 extra content and so on and also how 

00:00:45.930 --> 00:00:49.680
 we can check the deluxe version 

00:00:47.700 --> 00:00:52.739
 about this for pc so the theme 

00:00:49.680 --> 00:00:55.649
 consoles both ps4 ps3 and others I do not know 

00:00:52.739 --> 00:00:57.539
 how will it work on xbox too 

00:00:55.649 --> 00:01:00.510
 but it seems that the deluxe version only 

00:00:57.539 --> 00:01:02.239
 is going to be for pc and let's go now what 

00:01:00.510 --> 00:01:04.820
 most important of the two other ways 

00:01:02.239 --> 00:01:07.080
 the second way and the most unknown 

00:01:04.820 --> 00:01:09.210
 as we can read here 

00:01:07.080 --> 00:01:11.040
 nothing else being premium debate fil 3 already 

00:01:09.210 --> 00:01:13.200
 we have access to the battlefield beta 

00:01:11.040 --> 00:01:15.900
 4 and I think it's something that a lot of people 

00:01:13.200 --> 00:01:17.910
 I did not know and I found out a couple of 

00:01:15.900 --> 00:01:19.770
 days basically and that's why I wanted 

00:01:17.910 --> 00:01:22.710
 make the video to help them out 

00:01:19.770 --> 00:01:26.730
 that topic and for people who do not know 

00:01:22.710 --> 00:01:28.200
 also creates in the battlefield itself 

00:01:26.730 --> 00:01:30.210
 as we can check in this picture 

00:01:28.200 --> 00:01:33.330
 when they set the example and debate 

00:01:30.210 --> 00:01:35.220
 field 4 the official facebook itself 

00:01:33.330 --> 00:01:38.040
 battlefield as we can check here 

00:01:35.220 --> 00:01:40.170
 confirmed that those who had the 

00:01:38.040 --> 00:01:42.540
 had premium debate fritz 3 would have 

00:01:40.170 --> 00:01:43.920
 access to battlefield 4 beta well 

00:01:42.540 --> 00:01:45.600
 that basically translating here puts 

00:01:43.920 --> 00:01:47.700
 that to clarify it all that you have 

00:01:45.600 --> 00:01:49.440
 premium battlefield 3 you will have access to 

00:01:47.700 --> 00:01:51.720
 the beta of 2004 

00:01:49.440 --> 00:01:53.729
 basically that simple and for the 

00:01:51.720 --> 00:01:55.080
 people who still do not believe it or 

00:01:53.729 --> 00:01:57.119
 that he thinks is a strategy of 

00:01:55.080 --> 00:01:58.460
 marketing that after not estimate not what 

00:01:57.119 --> 00:02:00.890
 to be 

00:01:58.460 --> 00:02:02.900
 there is another way to prove it is that 

00:02:00.890 --> 00:02:06.920
 we have to go to source for example vale 

00:02:02.900 --> 00:02:09.709
 and you go to your games and where you have 

00:02:06.920 --> 00:02:11.420
 the battlefield 3 we make right click and 

00:02:09.709 --> 00:02:13.730
 We give you to show game information 

00:02:11.420 --> 00:02:15.319
 since we have two tabs details and 

00:02:13.730 --> 00:02:17.840
 storage we stay in the 

00:02:15.319 --> 00:02:21.110
 details tab and we go down below the 

00:02:17.840 --> 00:02:23.330
 everything where we have the expansions and 

00:02:21.110 --> 00:02:25.819
 As you can see , Battlefield 4 already comes out 

00:02:23.330 --> 00:02:28.640
 there it goes out and to activate when it's 

00:02:25.819 --> 00:02:30.950
 available is everything for people who are 

00:02:28.640 --> 00:02:33.700
 He asked for the Russian version like me 

00:02:30.950 --> 00:02:37.340
 example although the premium was purchased in 

00:02:33.700 --> 00:02:39.080
 a Mexican proxy or things like that do not have 

00:02:37.340 --> 00:02:41.360
 very clear if we really have access 

00:02:39.080 --> 00:02:43.700
 lateral to the vein thus in this way 

00:02:41.360 --> 00:02:47.300
 you can check it if you really have 

00:02:43.700 --> 00:02:49.100
 access to the beta so I repeat the 

00:02:47.300 --> 00:02:50.989
 procedure right click show 

00:02:49.100 --> 00:02:54.200
 information and we go down and in 

00:02:50.989 --> 00:02:57.260
 expansions you should leave the beta 

00:02:54.200 --> 00:02:58.790
 of battlefield 4 and the third way that 

00:02:57.260 --> 00:03:00.830
 he was also given a lot of hype but 

00:02:58.790 --> 00:03:03.860
 I think a lot of people do not know it is that 

00:03:00.830 --> 00:03:05.810
 buying one if you bought is the version 

00:03:03.860 --> 00:03:08.240
 to the deluxe version of the medal of honor 

00:03:05.810 --> 00:03:11.840
 warfighter you will also have access to 

00:03:08.240 --> 00:03:13.520
 beta of battlefield 4 I really do not know 

00:03:11.840 --> 00:03:16.610
 as well as can be seen 

00:03:13.520 --> 00:03:18.380
 because I the version I think I have I think 

00:03:16.610 --> 00:03:20.660
 that I have it I have appealed assigned 

00:03:18.380 --> 00:03:22.520
 here I do not get anything in expansions like that 

00:03:20.660 --> 00:03:24.590
 that the people who bought the version 

00:03:22.520 --> 00:03:26.620
 deluxe the limited version if not 

00:03:24.590 --> 00:03:30.770
 you are very sure the best thing is that 

00:03:26.620 --> 00:03:32.300
 contact with support of and that they 

00:03:30.770 --> 00:03:35.000
 themselves tell us if you really have 

00:03:32.300 --> 00:03:36.709
 access or you will not have access and now 

00:03:35.000 --> 00:03:38.720
 let's also do something pretty 

00:03:36.709 --> 00:03:40.820
 important that about the dates as 

00:03:38.720 --> 00:03:43.760
 you can read as you can read here they say 

00:03:40.820 --> 00:03:46.280
 the beta due out in late 2013 

00:03:43.760 --> 00:03:48.709
 summer of 2013 and the game will come out in 

00:03:46.280 --> 00:03:52.370
 fall of 2013 therefore if we take 

00:03:48.709 --> 00:03:53.840
 the references of vate filtres yo mis 

00:03:52.370 --> 00:03:56.180
 predictions and according to the data that 

00:03:53.840 --> 00:03:58.850
 we have here I suppose the beta of 

00:03:56.180 --> 00:04:00.620
 battlefield 4 would come out on late 

00:03:58.850 --> 00:04:03.140
 August beginning mid September 

00:04:00.620 --> 00:04:06.170
 more or less and the game 

00:04:03.140 --> 00:04:08.570
 I think something will come out sooner than in 

00:04:06.170 --> 00:04:10.460
 Christmas because more or less as with the 

00:04:08.570 --> 00:04:12.320
 bate free 3 that I think came out in 

00:04:10.460 --> 00:04:14.210
 October mid-October mid 

00:04:12.320 --> 00:04:15.800
 November, I more or less suppose 

00:04:14.210 --> 00:04:18.920
 which will be something similar 

00:04:15.800 --> 00:04:21.230
 so recapitulating more or less everything 

00:04:18.920 --> 00:04:22.940
 there are three ways to get the beta 

00:04:21.230 --> 00:04:25.220
 of battlefield 4 one of them is 

00:04:22.940 --> 00:04:25.700
 asking for the pack of looks for pc for 70 

00:04:25.220 --> 00:04:28.640
 euros 

00:04:25.700 --> 00:04:30.860
 the other is being premium debate filter 

00:04:28.640 --> 00:04:33.080
 is already we will have access and the third 

00:04:30.860 --> 00:04:34.790
 way is being good if we buy 

00:04:33.080 --> 00:04:37.490
 the limited or deluxe version of the medal 

00:04:34.790 --> 00:04:39.320
 of honor and on dates the beta of 

00:04:37.490 --> 00:04:40.700
 battlefield 4 would come out on late 

00:04:39.320 --> 00:04:42.800
 summer or if at the end of August or 

00:04:40.700 --> 00:04:44.600
 early September mid and the 

00:04:42.800 --> 00:04:47.180
 official game would come between October and 

00:04:44.600 --> 00:04:49.760
 November more or less that's the dates 

00:04:47.180 --> 00:04:51.560
 estimated on the data we have and 

00:04:49.760 --> 00:04:53.030
 nothing really on my part nothing more than 

00:04:51.560 --> 00:04:54.590
 add just tell you that this is my 

00:04:53.030 --> 00:04:56.650
 first video of the entire channel that is 

00:04:54.590 --> 00:04:59.450
 informative and explaining topics about 

00:04:56.650 --> 00:05:02.240
 news when the beta will be released and others 

00:04:59.450 --> 00:05:04.070
 but I saw it quite necessary to do it 

00:05:02.240 --> 00:05:05.630
 I think he has clarified many doubts 

00:05:04.070 --> 00:05:08.180
 about the truth that many people I 

00:05:05.630 --> 00:05:11.000
 has asked and so on so I think that 

00:05:08.180 --> 00:05:13.790
 I have helped you a lot if you like this 

00:05:11.000 --> 00:05:14.990
 kind of informative videos really 

00:05:13.790 --> 00:05:16.550
 I'm reading enough forums 

00:05:14.990 --> 00:05:19.010
 information on the subject debate 

00:05:16.550 --> 00:05:20.390
 4 and others and I have a lot of information 

00:05:19.010 --> 00:05:23.240
 held there that I think it can be 

00:05:20.390 --> 00:05:25.730
 interesting as marc more that will come out in 

00:05:23.240 --> 00:05:27.620
 the toilet four vehicles badges or what 

00:05:25.730 --> 00:05:29.000
 so be it so if you like this guy 

00:05:27.620 --> 00:05:30.590
 of videos I would like you to 

00:05:29.000 --> 00:05:32.900
 Did you know in the comments? 

00:05:30.590 --> 00:05:34.820
 for me to know that you really like them 

00:05:32.900 --> 00:05:36.860
 these videos and we get bored is watching 

00:05:34.820 --> 00:05:39.290
 a screen with my voice or whatever 

00:05:36.860 --> 00:05:41.210
 so if informative studies 

00:05:39.290 --> 00:05:42.890
 I like them so I'm going to do more 

00:05:41.210 --> 00:05:45.020
 I'll try some some employment and 

00:05:42.890 --> 00:05:46.640
 others so it's not so boring but 

00:05:45.020 --> 00:05:48.350
 this video had to do it 

00:05:46.640 --> 00:05:50.390
 with images so I saw it all 6 

00:05:48.350 --> 00:05:52.400
 clear and so I do not expect anything 

00:05:50.390 --> 00:05:54.500
 have helped you so for my part 

00:05:52.400 --> 00:05:56.890
 nothing more than that nobody reads until then 

00:05:54.500 --> 00:05:56.890
 people
