00:00:01.530 --> 00:00:04.159
 dollar 

00:00:27.440 --> 00:00:31.950
 hello get two workers in a row 

00:00:29.640 --> 00:00:34.200
 empty playoff playoffs here cards ex 

00:00:31.950 --> 00:00:36.420
 the topic of today's episode is kyle korver 

00:00:34.200 --> 00:00:38.430
 and how the red hocks play him free 

00:00:36.420 --> 00:00:41.850
 and how his abilities of the 

00:00:38.430 --> 00:00:43.710
 Use triple-line to hawk others completely 

00:00:41.850 --> 00:00:46.620
 completely free to litter 

00:00:43.710 --> 00:00:48.449
 the first place austrian like korver free 

00:00:46.620 --> 00:00:51.449
 the whole thing will start with a screen 

00:00:48.449 --> 00:00:52.500
 Great for great here from Paul Millsap 

00:00:51.449 --> 00:00:54.480
 to the pero antic 

00:00:52.500 --> 00:00:56.760
 in the end this should only serve 

00:00:54.480 --> 00:00:57.890
 the screener will get free and 

00:00:56.760 --> 00:01:00.090
 to play him there 

00:00:57.890 --> 00:01:01.829
 The following action actually looks 

00:01:00.090 --> 00:01:03.690
 how else is the screen but it is 

00:01:01.829 --> 00:01:05.369
 not because thabo sefolosha can go after 

00:01:03.690 --> 00:01:07.470
 Do not start with the ball so much 

00:01:05.369 --> 00:01:10.380
 it goes straight about that one korber 

00:01:07.470 --> 00:01:12.869
 screen sets for millsap because that should 

00:01:10.380 --> 00:01:15.060
 down in praise get out of the ball and 

00:01:12.869 --> 00:01:17.520
 Either own the ball of ends or 

00:01:15.060 --> 00:01:19.619
 just a very very good pass 

00:01:17.520 --> 00:01:19.950
 be station because we will see it soon 

00:01:19.619 --> 00:01:22.979
 here 

00:01:19.950 --> 00:01:25.229
 The cavs go with two man on mills 

00:01:22.979 --> 00:01:26.910
 was just as free is also corsmann 

00:01:25.229 --> 00:01:29.429
 reliable which of course absolutely 

00:01:26.910 --> 00:01:31.380
 does not go with sap sees immediately 

00:01:29.429 --> 00:01:32.970
 place was once designed as a table 

00:01:31.380 --> 00:01:35.159
 with researcher still a double screen 

00:01:32.970 --> 00:01:37.049
 provide to the buyer the need of 

00:01:35.159 --> 00:01:38.970
 situation not at all but you can do that 

00:01:37.049 --> 00:01:41.310
 little question still standing in the m gl and 

00:01:38.970 --> 00:01:44.400
 hardly punishes this action logically 

00:01:41.310 --> 00:01:47.549
 with the long ball on the next play 

00:01:44.400 --> 00:01:50.009
 Sport ends with a screen of two 

00:01:47.549 --> 00:01:51.299
 players for kalkofe we ​​see here 

00:01:50.009 --> 00:01:52.110
 again the first action again 

00:01:51.299 --> 00:01:55.320
 blog in the back 

00:01:52.110 --> 00:01:57.000
 from the defender of Paul C I believe so 

00:01:55.320 --> 00:01:59.369
 German roll who the e-voting screen 

00:01:57.000 --> 00:02:01.500
 in the spice not cooked suitcase 

00:01:59.369 --> 00:02:02.939
 cleverly waiting until sometimes the 

00:02:01.500 --> 00:02:05.280
 has caught ball and now he is preparing 

00:02:02.939 --> 00:02:08.190
 the blog very well in front of a screen two 

00:02:05.280 --> 00:02:09.840
 screens touchscreens get the ball and 

00:02:08.190 --> 00:02:11.850
 then it's just too late and the hawks 

00:02:09.840 --> 00:02:13.440
 but also does not play well in the 

00:02:11.850 --> 00:02:15.930
 defense, you have to say clearly 

00:02:13.440 --> 00:02:18.530
 another ones are against the 

00:02:15.930 --> 00:02:21.269
 celtics again illustrated how 

00:02:18.530 --> 00:02:23.430
 body the gravitation we ourselves 

00:02:21.269 --> 00:02:24.810
 Nowadays, hold calls surveying 

00:02:23.430 --> 00:02:27.180
 He gets the ball and engelbert 

00:02:24.810 --> 00:02:28.980
 league is for him yes is that in the pants 

00:02:27.180 --> 00:02:30.810
 as you say in German sports 

00:02:28.980 --> 00:02:33.450
 He does not even go away from him, he looks 

00:02:30.810 --> 00:02:35.040
 Not at all if it needs help somewhere though 

00:02:33.450 --> 00:02:36.480
 I have to move he only plays against 

00:02:35.040 --> 00:02:39.480
 kyle korver and that comes now the 

00:02:36.480 --> 00:02:41.099
 hawks with the first screen 

00:02:39.480 --> 00:02:43.319
 turn down there is there 

00:02:41.099 --> 00:02:45.000
 Of course, hardly playable, of course 

00:02:43.319 --> 00:02:46.590
 comdirect but again high and now 

00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:47.750
 we'll see the bradley natural right away 

00:02:46.590 --> 00:02:50.190
 very good defender 

00:02:47.750 --> 00:02:52.799
 here's just too late now because 

00:02:50.190 --> 00:02:54.750
 Again, it's not just this one 

00:02:52.799 --> 00:02:57.000
 a screen but bradley I have to 

00:02:54.750 --> 00:02:58.769
 right around two screens fight with sap 

00:02:57.000 --> 00:03:01.290
 chefs and thirdly screen if it be 

00:02:58.769 --> 00:03:04.530
 yes, then it is too late and the 

00:03:01.290 --> 00:03:05.910
 Help is not there in time yet 

00:03:04.530 --> 00:03:08.489
 A scene here against the clock set 

00:03:05.910 --> 00:03:10.950
 This time and what we see now 

00:03:08.489 --> 00:03:12.810
 it is actually the body somewhere else 

00:03:10.950 --> 00:03:14.730
 completely behind corner and now he goes in 

00:03:12.810 --> 00:03:16.799
 what is he doing there creating a blog for 

00:03:14.730 --> 00:03:19.049
 the opponent of hoped 

00:03:16.799 --> 00:03:21.629
 what's going on these are the so-called 

00:03:19.049 --> 00:03:23.579
 Counter these are the counteractions 

00:03:21.629 --> 00:03:25.290
 the hawks can run again and again 

00:03:23.579 --> 00:03:27.690
 if you read like the defense 

00:03:25.290 --> 00:03:29.579
 plays here again block against the 

00:03:27.690 --> 00:03:31.560
 man from middle against in the case it was 

00:03:29.579 --> 00:03:33.000
 Jonas The defense is the one another 

00:03:31.560 --> 00:03:35.160
 Diced it comes to a free 

00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:37.019
 three and that makes no buyers even so 

00:03:35.160 --> 00:03:38.370
 dangerous that his players just 

00:03:37.019 --> 00:03:40.109
 can also throw and if he then 

00:03:38.370 --> 00:03:42.930
 He noted to my stop is gone 

00:03:40.109 --> 00:03:44.910
 i will post blog for my then then 

00:03:42.930 --> 00:03:47.519
 Can they start what they see? 

00:03:44.910 --> 00:03:49.470
 she once almost opposes the utah jazz 

00:03:47.519 --> 00:03:51.840
 funny as both defenders at 

00:03:49.470 --> 00:03:53.519
 cuba remain him and ingres and 

00:03:51.840 --> 00:03:56.280
 end effect then the case is I think 

00:03:53.519 --> 00:03:59.400
 hoped to leave free again last 

00:03:56.280 --> 00:04:01.889
 scene milwaukee bucks again completely 

00:03:59.400 --> 00:04:03.359
 similar topic again it is body 

00:04:01.889 --> 00:04:04.049
 the rear notes the way up is 

00:04:03.359 --> 00:04:06.239
 delivered 

00:04:04.049 --> 00:04:07.859
 he runs round is still banned 

00:04:06.239 --> 00:04:10.680
 and you call that when hangover stops 

00:04:07.859 --> 00:04:13.290
 hit is falls still poses 

00:04:10.680 --> 00:04:14.730
 still the block and against the lhv word 

00:04:13.290 --> 00:04:17.039
 Freedom can be said that némirovsky 

00:04:14.730 --> 00:04:17.579
 bugs maybe not the best team of the 

00:04:17.039 --> 00:04:19.380
 nba 

00:04:17.579 --> 00:04:21.299
 but I think these scenes show a lot 

00:04:19.380 --> 00:04:24.380
 nice the cover is not just a thrower 

00:04:21.299 --> 00:04:24.380
 but also a preparer
