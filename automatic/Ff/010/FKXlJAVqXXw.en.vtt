 producer to see us with people 

00:00:24.640 --> 00:00:26.060
 such as how to get out 

00:00:26.060 --> 00:00:30.039

00:00:30.039 --> 00:00:33.129
 the main courses of the ppcv unda 

00:00:33.129 --> 00:00:35.630
 illusion witnesses of a leak 

00:00:35.630 --> 00:00:39.980
 but herrera like this afternoon I join three lenses three months and the chance of 

00:00:39.980 --> 00:00:41.240
 deal with the cards 

00:00:41.240 --> 00:00:43.040
 that is what is going to be treated 

00:00:43.040 --> 00:00:44.710
 roque we start you 

00:00:44.710 --> 00:00:49.019
 when they put you back part for the debut of practicing enríquez gamón 

00:00:52.020 --> 00:00:53.110
 He stressed that this year 

00:00:53.110 --> 00:00:56.059
 or that 15 years triplet of higuain the pkk have died 

00:00:56.059 --> 00:00:57.810
 the box office uses 

00:00:57.810 --> 00:00:59.659
 to all the public that 

00:00:59.659 --> 00:01:02.959
 There is a problem in danger among other personalities 

00:01:02.959 --> 00:01:05.929
 or what do we explain what is the mechanics that in June what many 

00:01:05.929 --> 00:01:06.720
 beings 

00:01:06.720 --> 00:01:09.720
 the theme is the synchronicity fabrics we are going to try to match 

00:01:10.300 --> 00:01:14.510
 percent the typical example of those of the substitution single stray bullet goes 

00:01:14.510 --> 00:01:18.410
 many bullets are thrown and suddenly it happens that an innocent victim passat 

00:01:18.410 --> 00:01:22.400
 and it will hit you but the odds you have as with this combo 

00:01:22.400 --> 00:01:25.149
 they know that they are totally before they happen 

00:01:25.149 --> 00:01:29.409
 but it happens I love you try to see here is if we are tuned by 

00:01:29.409 --> 00:01:32.560
 you are going to help me to make this really true 

00:01:32.560 --> 00:01:35.710
 we are going to distribute some letters we are going to distribute again 

00:01:35.710 --> 00:01:38.990
 abós bet like this for the whole table and after that one of you 

00:01:39.650 --> 00:01:41.510
 will break the pineapple 

00:01:41.510 --> 00:01:45.440
 and the balls are going to move then we are going to choose as sea that you 

00:01:45.440 --> 00:01:46.060
 want 

00:01:46.060 --> 00:01:51.090
 includes 15 put 15 balls and let's see how it stayed but for that 

00:01:51.090 --> 00:01:51.950
 me last night 

00:01:51.950 --> 00:01:53.420
 I had a dream 

00:01:53.420 --> 00:01:56.460
 lukewarm giant shuffle that is there for all to see 

00:01:56.460 --> 00:02:00.700
 in my dream without seeing so 'scarface' makes a letter and not virtual I gave it the 

00:02:00.700 --> 00:02:02.650
 spin and the very well produce 

00:02:02.650 --> 00:02:06.070
 I know that only one card died in that deck, I'm going to show it to you 

00:02:06.730 --> 00:02:09.970
 the belt itself so that it adopts it without stopping for Carlos Borja 

00:02:10.789 --> 00:02:12.519
 rafa jorda 

00:02:12.519 --> 00:02:14.559
 I want you to see 

00:02:14.559 --> 00:02:16.579
 artist will wash giant 

00:02:16.579 --> 00:02:18.789
 we are going to open 

00:02:18.789 --> 00:02:21.789
 a single letter the sale 

00:02:22.299 --> 00:02:25.299
 let's go back to save 

00:02:26.019 --> 00:02:28.339
 in his house 

00:02:28.339 --> 00:02:30.299
 I was going to stay here 

00:02:30.299 --> 00:02:33.379
 in this third in view of all we will not touch again 

00:02:35.579 --> 00:02:38.579
 I think the key to the camera is the ing 

00:02:39.879 --> 00:02:42.819
 if I have for now the little 

00:02:42.819 --> 00:02:45.329
 I want it to be the defeat in mind that is 

00:02:45.329 --> 00:02:47.189
 different poles letters 

00:02:47.189 --> 00:02:49.119
 so it is 

00:02:49.119 --> 00:02:50.719
 and that we are 

00:02:50.719 --> 00:02:52.459
 place to you 

00:02:52.459 --> 00:02:54.979
 savior 1 

00:02:54.979 --> 00:02:56.799
 the other half many famous 

00:02:56.799 --> 00:02:59.799
 I want them back so quickly remember things 

00:03:01.149 --> 00:03:04.439
 the conalep the barrier will take over 

00:03:04.439 --> 00:03:06.429
 I am satisfied 

00:03:06.429 --> 00:03:07.230
 perfect 

00:03:07.230 --> 00:03:09.699
 cheap porter by all 

00:03:09.699 --> 00:03:10.969
 this 

00:03:10.969 --> 00:03:14.469
 let's start distributing it for all the moderation of the half of the body 

00:03:14.969 --> 00:03:18.739
 or chuchin that is turned around is simply covering the greatest feat 

00:03:18.739 --> 00:03:22.059
 cover the largest area the whole cured table towards midfield 

00:03:22.059 --> 00:03:25.689
 all the center center nintendo and exactly al asad without census please 

00:03:25.689 --> 00:03:28.019
 they all pull around here they have letters 

00:03:28.019 --> 00:03:31.019
 imagine that it is people walking through the city of tijuana 

00:03:32.719 --> 00:03:36.150
 and this is the random life of the teporaca bush here also cover 

00:03:36.149 --> 00:03:37.079
 these areas 

00:03:37.079 --> 00:03:40.079
 bekele about here even for the water that comes here 

00:03:40.079 --> 00:03:42.019
 so that it is completely 

00:03:42.019 --> 00:03:44.809
 full discarded 

00:03:44.809 --> 00:03:47.849
 and now yes 

00:03:47.849 --> 00:03:51.229
 the odds 

00:03:51.229 --> 00:03:53.379
 one of his balls 

00:03:53.379 --> 00:03:57.849
 reach one of the 52 cards in the poker deck are one among 52 

00:03:58.549 --> 00:04:00.769
 that is, for each letter 

00:04:00.769 --> 00:04:04.909
 or for each ball there 780 possibilities of combinations 

00:04:04.909 --> 00:04:12.149
 now as there are 52 cards are 40 thousand 580 possibilities it is completely high 

00:04:12.149 --> 00:04:14.430
 when you have the most accurate pull 

00:04:14.430 --> 00:04:18.280
 to break the balls and spread who would be the real Madrid for the 

00:04:18.280 --> 00:04:21.300
 I transfer chava but again but he wants me to concentrate first 

00:04:22.169 --> 00:04:24.050
 he has to give an account 

00:04:24.050 --> 00:04:27.050
 10 this is a stray bullet 

00:04:27.800 --> 00:04:30.800
 break the pineapple please 

00:04:33.110 --> 00:04:34.979
 and now back 

00:04:34.979 --> 00:04:37.979
 I want you to think a number between one and 15 4 

00:04:40.180 --> 00:04:43.180
 charcoal bureaucracy 

00:04:44.349 --> 00:04:47.659
 make the camera because it was an improved perspective 

00:04:47.659 --> 00:04:49.499
 which of the three letters that you 

00:04:49.499 --> 00:04:52.499
 this bet is a better face 

00:04:53.460 --> 00:04:56.210
 when I was about to confirm 

00:04:56.210 --> 00:05:00.039
 percent can help me to this park and the many others who want it 

00:05:01.789 --> 00:05:05.599
 the pilot also go to postpone them I want to play absolutely 

00:05:05.599 --> 00:05:08.620
 you can remove this wave 

00:05:08.620 --> 00:05:11.620
 and encourage a little more the balls she 

00:05:12.210 --> 00:05:14.360
 let's see one thing 

00:05:14.360 --> 00:05:17.360
 I'm going to cross over here 

00:05:18.860 --> 00:05:20.620
 I have here 

00:05:20.620 --> 00:05:22.069
 and shuffle 

00:05:22.069 --> 00:05:25.069
 this is the letter that remains 

00:05:39.770 --> 00:05:41.139
 is already concentrated 

00:05:41.139 --> 00:05:44.139
 I'm concentrating 

00:05:47.279 --> 00:05:49.409
 Here is the letter 

00:05:49.409 --> 00:05:50.979
 I told them 

00:05:50.979 --> 00:05:53.979
 I'll just put it 

00:05:55.289 --> 00:05:58.599
 is to have the camera processed please 

00:05:58.599 --> 00:06:01.789
 do not miss it from the historic moment the cameras 

00:06:01.789 --> 00:06:04.789
 avoid pegaso for Carlos Osorio 

00:06:06.779 --> 00:06:09.300
 this is the ball 13 own texts ends 

00:06:09.300 --> 00:06:12.300
 and this was the catastrophe 

00:06:14.439 --> 00:06:17.439
 I could flip the special letter 

00:06:21.520 --> 00:06:24.520
 I wanted to say the same capetillo 

00:06:32.059 --> 00:06:32.609
 mrz
