00:01:02.540 --> 00:01:02.550 
the idea for this Pokemon it was

00:01:02.550 --> 00:01:06.020 
the idea for this Pokemon it was
interesting<00:01:03.300> but<00:01:03.510> frankly<00:01:04.350> he<00:01:04.739> sucks<00:01:05.010> and<00:01:05.309> it

00:01:06.020 --> 00:01:06.030 
interesting but frankly he sucks and it

00:01:06.030 --> 00:01:06.969 
interesting but frankly he sucks and it
was<00:01:06.150> just<00:01:06.479> a<00:01:06.570> gimmick

00:01:06.969 --> 00:01:06.979 
was just a gimmick

00:01:06.979 --> 00:01:09.859 
was just a gimmick
hopefully<00:01:07.979> X&amp;Y<00:01:08.310> brings<00:01:08.790> a<00:01:09.150> little<00:01:09.540> something

00:01:09.859 --> 00:01:09.869 
hopefully X&amp;Y brings a little something

00:01:09.869 --> 00:01:12.170 
hopefully X&amp;Y brings a little something
new<00:01:09.900> to<00:01:10.229> him<00:01:10.350> gives<00:01:11.070> him<00:01:11.130> something<00:01:11.729> extra<00:01:12.060> you

00:01:12.170 --> 00:01:12.180 
new to him gives him something extra you

00:01:12.180 --> 00:01:14.359 
new to him gives him something extra you
know<00:01:12.299> maybe<00:01:12.659> alluding<00:01:13.200> towards<00:01:13.830> cast<00:01:14.100> or<00:01:14.280> when

00:01:14.359 --> 00:01:14.369 
know maybe alluding towards cast or when

00:01:14.369 --> 00:01:16.490 
know maybe alluding towards cast or when
just<00:01:14.549> giving<00:01:14.880> him<00:01:15.030> a<00:01:15.299> little<00:01:15.780> love<00:01:16.229> tap
