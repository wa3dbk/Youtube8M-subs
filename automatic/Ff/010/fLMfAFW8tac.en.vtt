update of service pack 1 better to apply

00:00:20.940 --> 00:00:23.210 
update of service pack 1 better to apply
it<00:00:21.210> on<00:00:21.330> passive<00:00:21.870> server<00:00:22.170> first<00:00:22.440> and<00:00:22.680> do<00:00:23.190> a

00:00:23.210 --> 00:00:23.220 
it on passive server first and do a

00:00:23.220 --> 00:00:27.140 
it on passive server first and do a
failover<00:00:23.730> and<00:00:24.230> apply<00:00:25.230> the<00:00:25.290> patch<00:00:25.740> on<00:00:26.010> the<00:00:26.490> new

failover and apply the patch on the new
passive<00:00:27.570> server<00:00:27.810> okay<00:00:28.670> so<00:00:29.670> in<00:00:29.910> this<00:00:30.060> case<00:00:30.390> I

00:00:31.089 --> 00:00:31.099 
passive server okay so in this case I

00:00:31.099 --> 00:00:35.180 
passive server okay so in this case I
have<00:00:32.099> installed<00:00:32.690> sequel<00:00:33.690> server<00:00:33.840> on<00:00:34.200> node<00:00:34.950> 1

00:00:35.180 --> 00:00:35.190 
have installed sequel server on node 1

00:00:35.190 --> 00:00:39.020 
have installed sequel server on node 1
and<00:00:35.340> node<00:00:35.370> 2<00:00:35.690> ok<00:00:36.690> so<00:00:36.749> we<00:00:37.019> have<00:00:37.699> the<00:00:38.699> sequel

00:00:39.020 --> 00:00:39.030 
and node 2 ok so we have the sequel

00:00:39.030 --> 00:00:40.669 
and node 2 ok so we have the sequel
server<00:00:39.179> installed<00:00:39.809> on<00:00:39.960> 2<00:00:40.199> nodes

00:00:40.669 --> 00:00:40.679 
server installed on 2 nodes

00:00:40.679 --> 00:00:42.950 
server installed on 2 nodes
it<00:00:40.920> is<00:00:41.010> a<00:00:41.100> said<00:00:41.489> right<00:00:41.909> now<00:00:41.940> the<00:00:42.390> two<00:00:42.600> nodes<00:00:42.780> are

00:00:42.950 --> 00:00:42.960 
it is a said right now the two nodes are

00:00:42.960 --> 00:00:44.450 
it is a said right now the two nodes are
clustered<00:00:43.379> but<00:00:43.620> we<00:00:43.769> still<00:00:43.949> have<00:00:44.159> one<00:00:44.280> more

00:00:44.450 --> 00:00:44.460 
clustered but we still have one more

00:00:44.460 --> 00:00:46.610 
clustered but we still have one more
node<00:00:44.670> we<00:00:44.969> didn't<00:00:45.210> install<00:00:45.480> sequels<00:00:46.289> are<00:00:46.379> on

00:00:46.610 --> 00:00:46.620 
node we didn't install sequels are on

00:00:46.620 --> 00:00:49.669 
node we didn't install sequels are on
the<00:00:46.769> nor<00:00:47.249> yet<00:00:47.519> so<00:00:48.269> that's<00:00:48.569> fine

00:00:49.669 --> 00:00:49.679 
the nor yet so that's fine

00:00:49.679 --> 00:00:51.889 
the nor yet so that's fine
we<00:00:50.129> can<00:00:50.280> have<00:00:50.489> the<00:00:50.999> three<00:00:51.210> nodes<00:00:51.690> in<00:00:51.809> the

00:00:51.889 --> 00:00:51.899 
we can have the three nodes in the

00:00:51.899 --> 00:00:54.950 
we can have the three nodes in the
cluster<00:00:52.429> but<00:00:53.429> you<00:00:53.940> can<00:00:54.120> have<00:00:54.329> any<00:00:54.659> number<00:00:54.719> of

00:00:54.950 --> 00:00:54.960 
cluster but you can have any number of

00:00:54.960 --> 00:00:56.689 
cluster but you can have any number of
nodes<00:00:55.289> that<00:00:55.379> are<00:00:55.620> participating<00:00:56.010> in<00:00:56.339> a<00:00:56.399> sequel

00:00:56.689 --> 00:00:56.699 
nodes that are participating in a sequel

00:00:56.699 --> 00:00:59.239 
nodes that are participating in a sequel
cluster<00:00:57.059> ok<00:00:57.899> you<00:00:58.350> cannot<00:00:58.559> fail<00:00:58.859> over<00:00:59.100> the

00:00:59.239 --> 00:00:59.249 
cluster ok you cannot fail over the

00:00:59.249 --> 00:01:01.669 
cluster ok you cannot fail over the
sequel<00:00:59.579> server<00:00:59.729> resource<00:01:00.569> group<00:01:01.109> to<00:01:01.379> the<00:01:01.499> node

00:01:01.669 --> 00:01:01.679 
sequel server resource group to the node

00:01:01.679 --> 00:01:03.229 
sequel server resource group to the node
3<00:01:01.949> because<00:01:02.309> it's<00:01:02.460> not<00:01:02.639> going<00:01:02.850> to<00:01:02.940> work<00:01:03.030> there

00:01:03.229 --> 00:01:03.239 
3 because it's not going to work there

00:01:03.239 --> 00:01:05.539 
3 because it's not going to work there
is<00:01:03.329> no<00:01:03.449> sequel<00:01:03.809> server<00:01:03.899> service<00:01:04.320> there<00:01:04.559> ok<00:01:05.519> so

00:01:05.539 --> 00:01:05.549 
is no sequel server service there ok so

00:01:05.549 --> 00:01:09.820 
is no sequel server service there ok so
right<00:01:06.030> now<00:01:06.210> the<00:01:06.600> node<00:01:06.900> 1<00:01:07.170> we<00:01:07.650> are<00:01:07.799> in<00:01:07.979> node<00:01:08.880> 1

00:01:09.820 --> 00:01:09.830 
right now the node 1 we are in node 1

00:01:09.830 --> 00:01:14.690 
right now the node 1 we are in node 1
the<00:01:10.830> act<00:01:10.950> to<00:01:11.160> notice<00:01:11.490> node<00:01:11.910> 2<00:01:12.210> so<00:01:13.460> node<00:01:14.460> 1<00:01:14.670> is

00:01:14.690 --> 00:01:14.700 
the act to notice node 2 so node 1 is

00:01:14.700 --> 00:01:18.890 
the act to notice node 2 so node 1 is
passive<00:01:15.210> now<00:01:15.830> now<00:01:16.830> let's<00:01:17.100> run<00:01:17.700> the<00:01:17.940> hatch<00:01:18.540> on

00:01:18.890 --> 00:01:18.900 
passive now now let's run the hatch on

00:01:18.900 --> 00:01:21.620 
passive now now let's run the hatch on
the<00:01:19.710> passive<00:01:20.100> node<00:01:20.280> which<00:01:20.520> is<00:01:20.550> not<00:01:20.880> one<00:01:21.090> that

00:01:21.620 --> 00:01:21.630 
the passive node which is not one that

00:01:21.630 --> 00:01:24.020 
the passive node which is not one that
means<00:01:21.810> it<00:01:22.020> will<00:01:22.320> upgrade<00:01:22.740> or<00:01:22.980> update<00:01:23.610> the

00:01:24.020 --> 00:01:24.030 
means it will upgrade or update the

00:01:24.030 --> 00:01:26.300 
means it will upgrade or update the
sequel<00:01:24.390> server<00:01:24.510> software<00:01:24.870> on<00:01:25.410> this<00:01:26.040> server

00:01:26.300 --> 00:01:26.310 
sequel server software on this server

00:01:26.310 --> 00:01:30.290 
sequel server software on this server
which<00:01:26.580> is<00:01:26.730> not<00:01:26.940> one<00:01:27.120> server<00:01:28.910> then<00:01:29.910> after<00:01:30.180> that

00:01:30.290 --> 00:01:30.300 
which is not one server then after that

00:01:30.300 --> 00:01:31.280 
which is not one server then after that
we<00:01:30.480> do<00:01:30.660> a<00:01:30.690> failover

00:01:31.280 --> 00:01:31.290 
we do a failover

00:01:31.290 --> 00:01:35.020 
we do a failover
from<00:01:31.740> node<00:01:31.980> 2<00:01:32.190> to<00:01:32.220> node<00:01:32.400> 1<00:01:32.850> and<00:01:33.410> update<00:01:34.410> the

00:01:35.020 --> 00:01:35.030 
from node 2 to node 1 and update the

00:01:35.030 --> 00:01:39.350 
from node 2 to node 1 and update the
software<00:01:36.030> on<00:01:36.530> node<00:01:37.530> 2<00:01:37.740> and<00:01:37.910> we<00:01:38.910> can<00:01:39.060> do<00:01:39.180> one

00:01:39.350 --> 00:01:39.360 
software on node 2 and we can do one

00:01:39.360 --> 00:01:41.570 
software on node 2 and we can do one
more<00:01:39.390> failover<00:01:39.870> back<00:01:40.500> to<00:01:40.710> not<00:01:40.890> two<00:01:41.070> to<00:01:41.400> make

00:01:41.570 --> 00:01:41.580 
more failover back to not two to make

00:01:41.580 --> 00:01:49.000 
more failover back to not two to make
sure<00:01:41.730> everything<00:01:42.150> is<00:01:42.600> working<00:01:42.810> fine

00:02:26.420 --> 00:02:26.430 
are there open up and running it will

00:02:26.430 --> 00:02:30.280 
are there open up and running it will
suggest<00:02:26.670> to<00:02:26.879> stop<00:02:27.239> it

00:02:30.280 --> 00:02:30.290 

00:02:30.290 --> 00:02:32.930 

but<00:02:31.290> we<00:02:31.470> know<00:02:31.620> that<00:02:31.650> sequel<00:02:32.129> server<00:02:32.250> services

00:02:32.930 --> 00:02:32.940 
but we know that sequel server services

00:02:32.940 --> 00:02:35.899 
but we know that sequel server services
is<00:02:33.180> not<00:02:33.510> running<00:02:34.440> on<00:02:34.590> this<00:02:34.709> passive<00:02:35.099> node<00:02:35.310> so

00:02:35.899 --> 00:02:35.909 
is not running on this passive node so

00:02:35.909 --> 00:02:37.250 
is not running on this passive node so
basically<00:02:36.510> it<00:02:36.569> should<00:02:36.659> not<00:02:36.870> complain

00:02:37.250 --> 00:02:37.260 
basically it should not complain

00:02:37.260 --> 00:02:40.729 
basically it should not complain
anything<00:02:37.920> the<00:02:38.730> anything<00:02:39.150> that<00:02:39.590> services<00:02:40.590> our

00:02:40.729 --> 00:02:40.739 
anything the anything that services our

00:02:40.739 --> 00:02:43.520 
anything the anything that services our
upon<00:02:40.950> running<00:02:41.129> you<00:02:41.370> know<00:02:42.049> all<00:02:43.049> right

00:02:43.520 --> 00:02:43.530 
upon running you know all right

00:02:43.530 --> 00:02:45.619 
upon running you know all right
the<00:02:43.890> check<00:02:44.099> is<00:02:44.280> completed<00:02:44.790> it<00:02:45.090> says<00:02:45.359> that

00:02:45.619 --> 00:02:45.629 
the check is completed it says that

00:02:45.629 --> 00:02:47.750 
the check is completed it says that
there<00:02:46.019> are<00:02:46.049> no<00:02:46.290> files<00:02:46.590> which<00:02:47.340> are<00:02:47.489> up<00:02:47.609> and

00:02:47.750 --> 00:02:47.760 
there are no files which are up and

00:02:47.760 --> 00:02:50.149 
there are no files which are up and
running<00:02:47.909> otherwise<00:02:48.780> so<00:02:49.109> I<00:02:49.200> know<00:02:49.290> if<00:02:49.739> the

00:02:50.149 --> 00:02:50.159 
running otherwise so I know if the

00:02:50.159 --> 00:02:52.309 
running otherwise so I know if the
sequel<00:02:50.489> server<00:02:50.639> services<00:02:51.299> are<00:02:51.480> WMI<00:02:51.989> anything

00:02:52.309 --> 00:02:52.319 
sequel server services are WMI anything

00:02:52.319 --> 00:02:54.949 
sequel server services are WMI anything
any<00:02:52.680> service<00:02:53.069> or<00:02:53.250> any<00:02:53.400> file<00:02:53.639> is<00:02:53.790> open<00:02:54.180> it<00:02:54.810> will

00:02:54.949 --> 00:02:54.959 
any service or any file is open it will

00:02:54.959 --> 00:02:57.410 
any service or any file is open it will
say<00:02:55.139> go<00:02:55.379> ahead<00:02:55.440> and<00:02:55.560> stop<00:02:55.980> that<00:02:56.159> file<00:02:56.430> stop

00:02:57.410 --> 00:02:57.420 
say go ahead and stop that file stop

00:02:57.420 --> 00:03:00.460 
say go ahead and stop that file stop
that<00:02:57.599> process<00:02:57.780> and<00:02:58.700> refresh<00:02:59.700> the<00:02:59.879> check<00:03:00.060> again

00:03:00.460 --> 00:03:00.470 
that process and refresh the check again

00:03:00.470 --> 00:03:04.490 
that process and refresh the check again
so<00:03:01.470> in<00:03:01.620> our<00:03:01.739> case<00:03:02.629> we<00:03:03.629> are<00:03:03.659> fine<00:03:03.959> there<00:03:04.260> are<00:03:04.379> no

00:03:04.490 --> 00:03:04.500 
so in our case we are fine there are no

00:03:04.500 --> 00:03:07.990 
so in our case we are fine there are no
files<00:03:04.680> in<00:03:04.920> use<00:03:05.069> we<00:03:05.310> don't<00:03:05.459> need<00:03:05.639> any<00:03:05.819> reboots

00:03:07.990 --> 00:03:08.000 
files in use we don't need any reboots

00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:14.589 
files in use we don't need any reboots
let's<00:03:09.000> update<00:03:09.510> the<00:03:10.129> sequel<00:03:11.129> server<00:03:11.340> with<00:03:12.180> cu3
