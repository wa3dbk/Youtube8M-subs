chuck<00:04:34.900> cheetah<00:04:35.410> to<00:04:35.710> hunt<00:04:35.920> I<00:04:36.720> mean<00:04:38.520> obviously

00:04:39.510 --> 00:04:39.520 
chuck cheetah to hunt I mean obviously

00:04:39.520 --> 00:04:42.780 
chuck cheetah to hunt I mean obviously
being<00:04:39.820> home<00:04:40.300> read<00:04:40.600> and<00:04:41.250> it's<00:04:42.250> very<00:04:42.460> you<00:04:42.760> know

00:04:42.780 --> 00:04:42.790 
being home read and it's very you know

00:04:42.790 --> 00:04:44.580 
being home read and it's very you know
friendly<00:04:43.300> with<00:04:43.450> us<00:04:43.540> but<00:04:43.900> what<00:04:44.080> we<00:04:44.170> hope<00:04:44.320> to<00:04:44.470> do

00:04:44.580 --> 00:04:44.590 
friendly with us but what we hope to do

00:04:44.590 --> 00:04:46.290 
friendly with us but what we hope to do
one<00:04:44.740> day<00:04:44.890> is<00:04:44.950> breed<00:04:45.310> and<00:04:45.550> release<00:04:45.790> cheetahs

00:04:46.290 --> 00:04:46.300 
one day is breed and release cheetahs

00:04:46.300 --> 00:04:48.690 
one day is breed and release cheetahs
into<00:04:46.570> the<00:04:46.660> wild<00:04:46.930> in<00:04:47.020> Africa<00:04:47.250> so<00:04:48.250> in<00:04:48.460> order<00:04:48.550> to

00:04:48.690 --> 00:04:48.700 
into the wild in Africa so in order to

00:04:48.700 --> 00:04:50.820 
into the wild in Africa so in order to
do<00:04:48.940> it<00:04:49.090> we<00:04:49.870> thought<00:04:50.020> it<00:04:50.170> would<00:04:50.290> be<00:04:50.470> good<00:04:50.650> to

00:04:50.820 --> 00:04:50.830 
do it we thought it would be good to

00:04:50.830 --> 00:04:52.470 
do it we thought it would be good to
have<00:04:50.950> a<00:04:51.010> good<00:04:51.190> bit<00:04:51.370> of<00:04:51.400> practice<00:04:51.910> before<00:04:52.180> we

00:04:52.470 --> 00:04:52.480 
have a good bit of practice before we

00:04:52.480 --> 00:04:54.900 
have a good bit of practice before we
leave<00:04:52.740> so<00:04:53.740> if<00:04:53.800> I<00:04:53.920> come<00:04:54.160> in<00:04:54.280> here<00:04:54.490> it's<00:04:54.670> a<00:04:54.790> great

00:04:54.900 --> 00:04:54.910 
leave so if I come in here it's a great

00:04:54.910 --> 00:04:57.150 
leave so if I come in here it's a great
way<00:04:55.180> for<00:04:55.210> us<00:04:55.450> to<00:04:55.690> experiment<00:04:56.320> and<00:04:56.560> to<00:04:57.010> actually

00:04:57.150 --> 00:04:57.160 
way for us to experiment and to actually

00:04:57.160 --> 00:04:59.340 
way for us to experiment and to actually
see<00:04:57.340> what<00:04:57.820> it<00:04:57.910> involves<00:04:58.390> training<00:04:59.140> the

00:04:59.340 --> 00:04:59.350 
see what it involves training the

00:04:59.350 --> 00:05:02.160 
see what it involves training the
cheetah<00:04:59.560> to<00:04:59.830> hunt<00:05:00.040> so<00:05:00.880> if<00:05:01.150> I<00:05:01.330> spend<00:05:01.780> a<00:05:01.870> long

00:05:02.160 --> 00:05:02.170 
cheetah to hunt so if I spend a long

00:05:02.170 --> 00:05:04.680 
cheetah to hunt so if I spend a long
time<00:05:02.200> teaching<00:05:02.890> bomani<00:05:03.400> he<00:05:03.940> can<00:05:04.240> be<00:05:04.390> the<00:05:04.510> one

00:05:04.680 --> 00:05:04.690 
time teaching bomani he can be the one

00:05:04.690 --> 00:05:06.360 
time teaching bomani he can be the one
that<00:05:04.870> will<00:05:04.960> teach<00:05:05.170> the<00:05:05.380> future<00:05:05.560> cubs<00:05:06.070> how<00:05:06.310> to

00:05:06.360 --> 00:05:06.370 
that will teach the future cubs how to

00:05:06.370 --> 00:05:12.450 
that will teach the future cubs how to
hunt<00:05:06.730> in<00:05:06.910> a<00:05:06.970> wild<00:05:10.530> not<00:05:11.530> until<00:05:11.770> the<00:05:11.860> other<00:05:12.010> day

00:05:12.450 --> 00:05:12.460 
hunt in a wild not until the other day

00:05:12.460 --> 00:05:14.160 
hunt in a wild not until the other day
I<00:05:12.490> mean<00:05:12.700> he's<00:05:12.850> eaten<00:05:13.090> plenty<00:05:13.390> of<00:05:13.540> them<00:05:13.720> yeah<00:05:13.990> I

00:05:14.160 --> 00:05:14.170 
I mean he's eaten plenty of them yeah I

00:05:14.170 --> 00:05:15.720 
I mean he's eaten plenty of them yeah I
don't<00:05:14.440> think<00:05:14.650> he<00:05:14.740> actually<00:05:14.770> knows<00:05:15.340> what<00:05:15.610> they

00:05:15.720 --> 00:05:15.730 
don't think he actually knows what they

00:05:15.730 --> 00:05:20.910 
don't think he actually knows what they
are<00:05:16.590> he<00:05:17.590> knows<00:05:17.770> the<00:05:17.980> smell<00:05:18.870> yeah<00:05:19.870> but<00:05:20.290> I<00:05:20.350> don't

00:05:20.910 --> 00:05:20.920 
are he knows the smell yeah but I don't

00:05:20.920 --> 00:05:22.650

00:05:24.960 --> 00:05:24.970 
that he's fed from a freezer to the ones

00:05:24.970 --> 00:05:26.250 
that he's fed from a freezer to the ones
that<00:05:25.210> are<00:05:25.270> hopping<00:05:25.510> around<00:05:25.630> in<00:05:25.930> that<00:05:26.020> field

00:05:26.250 --> 00:05:26.260 
that are hopping around in that field

00:05:26.260 --> 00:05:29.280 
that are hopping around in that field
out<00:05:26.440> there<00:05:26.470> going<00:05:27.370> back<00:05:27.580> to<00:05:27.760> Africa<00:05:28.600> the<00:05:28.960> the

out there going back to Africa the the

00:05:29.290 --> 00:05:31.680 
out there going back to Africa the the

00:05:31.680 --> 00:05:31.690 
conservation side of it cheetahs are

00:05:31.690 --> 00:05:33.660 
conservation side of it cheetahs are
threatened<00:05:32.320> status<00:05:32.650> at<00:05:32.920> the<00:05:32.980> moment<00:05:33.280> yeah

00:05:33.660 --> 00:05:33.670 
threatened status at the moment yeah

00:05:33.670 --> 00:05:35.960 
threatened status at the moment yeah
we're<00:05:33.940> treaties<00:05:34.840> are<00:05:35.020> an<00:05:35.080> endangered<00:05:35.590> species

00:05:35.960 --> 00:05:35.970 
we're treaties are an endangered species

00:05:35.970 --> 00:05:38.460 
we're treaties are an endangered species
there<00:05:36.970> was<00:05:37.090> a<00:05:37.120> hundred<00:05:37.570> thousand<00:05:38.050> cheetahs

00:05:38.460 --> 00:05:38.470 
there was a hundred thousand cheetahs

00:05:38.470 --> 00:05:40.129 
there was a hundred thousand cheetahs
left<00:05:38.680> in<00:05:38.830> the<00:05:38.919> wild<00:05:39.070> about<00:05:39.460> a<00:05:39.520> hundred

00:05:40.129 --> 00:05:40.139 
left in the wild about a hundred

00:05:40.139 --> 00:05:42.739 
left in the wild about a hundred
to<00:05:40.229> go<00:05:40.430> and<00:05:41.430> today<00:05:41.819> it's<00:05:42.030> about<00:05:42.120> twelve<00:05:42.569> and<00:05:42.659> a

00:05:42.739 --> 00:05:42.749 
to go and today it's about twelve and a

00:05:42.749 --> 00:05:44.749 
to go and today it's about twelve and a
half<00:05:42.780> thousand<00:05:43.439> left<00:05:43.650> so<00:05:44.249> the<00:05:44.370> numbers<00:05:44.669> have

00:05:44.749 --> 00:05:44.759 
half thousand left so the numbers have

00:05:44.759 --> 00:05:46.520 
half thousand left so the numbers have
dropped<00:05:44.879> so<00:05:45.180> quickly<00:05:45.659> this<00:05:45.810> is<00:05:45.870> why<00:05:46.110> we<00:05:46.319> think

00:05:46.520 --> 00:05:46.530 
dropped so quickly this is why we think

00:05:46.530 --> 00:05:48.050 
dropped so quickly this is why we think
if<00:05:46.710> we're<00:05:46.889> going<00:05:47.039> to<00:05:47.099> bother<00:05:47.249> having<00:05:47.520> cheetahs

00:05:48.050 --> 00:05:48.060 
if we're going to bother having cheetahs

00:05:48.060 --> 00:05:49.010 
if we're going to bother having cheetahs
in<00:05:48.180> captivity

00:05:49.010 --> 00:05:49.020 
in captivity

00:05:49.020 --> 00:05:50.839 
in captivity
then<00:05:49.439> we<00:05:49.560> should<00:05:49.740> really<00:05:49.919> make<00:05:50.159> the<00:05:50.279> next<00:05:50.669> step

00:05:50.839 --> 00:05:50.849 
then we should really make the next step

00:05:50.849 --> 00:05:52.070 
then we should really make the next step
