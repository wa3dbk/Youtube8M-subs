 stage 8 that started 

00:00:49.380 --> 00:00:56.199
 it 's a state issue 

00:00:52.850 --> 00:00:56.199
 only with the camera 

00:00:56.960 --> 00:01:01.350
 good that the theme is that stage 8 

00:00:59.520 --> 00:01:03.840

00:01:01.350 --> 00:01:05.670
 months and it's over in nairobi I have to 

00:01:03.840 --> 00:01:07.440
 be in the ryder between 11 and 13 

00:01:05.670 --> 00:01:09.660

 phenomenal we will laugh and 

00:01:11.729 --> 00:01:15.360
 Someone else came this blog wanted 

00:01:13.410 --> 00:01:17.880
 talk to you about everything I wanted to tell you about 

00:01:15.360 --> 00:01:19.350
 theme of traveling by stages as 

00:01:17.880 --> 00:01:21.690
 important to travel by stages is 

00:01:19.350 --> 00:01:24.140
 find a place to leave the motorcycle 

00:01:21.690 --> 00:01:26.150
 Y 

00:01:24.140 --> 00:01:28.070
 each end of stage you have to find him 

00:01:26.150 --> 00:01:29.240
 a hotel to the motorcycle at the beginning 

00:01:28.070 --> 00:01:31.040
 I was worried a lot before I left 

00:01:29.240 --> 00:01:33.470
 lately and I always worried 

00:01:31.040 --> 00:01:35.240
 that I arrive at a meeting encounter 

00:01:33.470 --> 00:01:38.000
 where to leave it safe this time has not 

00:01:35.240 --> 00:01:40.720
 could have been better because it's official bbv 

00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:42.760
 the bike is badly damaged 

00:01:40.720 --> 00:01:45.670
 it has many scars of war this 

00:01:42.760 --> 00:01:48.120
 stretch is very hard and things have happened 

00:01:45.670 --> 00:01:50.560
 lately created I will teach and 

00:01:48.120 --> 00:01:53.200
 you will need intensive care nothing 

00:01:50.560 --> 00:01:55.360
 important nothing inside is everything then 

00:01:53.200 --> 00:01:57.070
 the picture the screen of the suitcases 

00:01:55.360 --> 00:01:59.200
 Well now what I'm going to do is 

00:01:57.070 --> 00:02:00.700
 disassemble things the front suspension 

00:01:59.200 --> 00:02:03.580
 is very fucked then I'm going to 

00:02:00.700 --> 00:02:06.300
 take I think because he has already told me that 

00:02:03.580 --> 00:02:06.300
 know someone 

00:02:55.740 --> 00:03:01.940
 it's 5:30 we're in istanbul 

00:02:58.290 --> 00:03:01.940
 How hot are you in this continent? 

00:03:02.359 --> 00:03:07.579
 following with the video once you have already 

00:03:05.519 --> 00:03:09.379
 the motorcycle guardadita and in this case also 

00:03:07.579 --> 00:03:12.480
 disassembled by the theme of the pieces 

00:03:09.379 --> 00:03:16.170
 is another important issue that is the 

00:03:12.480 --> 00:03:18.269
 luggage I always leave things there and I 

00:03:16.170 --> 00:03:20.579
 I bring others then what I do 

00:03:18.269 --> 00:03:22.349
 it is always and this is a quality but 

00:03:20.579 --> 00:03:24.359
 you have to keep in mind 

00:03:22.349 --> 00:03:25.590
 I make a video of the things that are left 

00:03:24.359 --> 00:03:27.989
 because then the truth that then never 

00:03:25.590 --> 00:03:29.609
 you remember that you have left and that 

00:03:27.989 --> 00:03:32.719
 no but the third most important one is missing 

00:03:29.609 --> 00:03:32.719
 that now 

00:03:34.090 --> 00:03:37.260
 we are here 

00:03:49.700 --> 00:03:55.900
 how about bulerÃ­as we are in madrid 

00:03:52.270 --> 00:03:59.780
 then continuing with the video of 

00:03:55.900 --> 00:04:01.970
 finish them one of the things that has 

00:03:59.780 --> 00:04:06.380
 when you travel in stages and you do not have 

00:04:01.970 --> 00:04:08.000
 home is to blow somewhere then 

00:04:06.380 --> 00:04:09.410
 for a few days of being at home a 

00:04:08.000 --> 00:04:11.450
 friend who is on vacation on top of 

00:04:09.410 --> 00:04:13.550
 home and then we'll see where I am 

00:04:11.450 --> 00:04:16.880
 I mean for the month and a half or two I wanted 

00:04:13.550 --> 00:04:20.620
 be in spain well we follow then 

00:04:16.880 --> 00:04:20.620
 with the video and I'm still making arrangements 

00:04:23.230 --> 00:04:27.650
 and he's going to be a very intense day and very 

00:04:25.240 --> 00:04:31.389
 long and kill fast 

00:04:27.650 --> 00:04:31.389
 is that someone gives you a motorcycle 

00:04:37.670 --> 00:04:41.770
 let's go I have five minutes to get there 

00:04:39.560 --> 00:04:44.160
 a 'radio brand' 

00:04:41.770 --> 00:04:47.900
 let's go 

00:04:44.160 --> 00:04:52.220
 three chosen music each and that's not 

00:04:47.900 --> 00:04:52.220
 well there is that you have to 

00:04:58.390 --> 00:05:03.940
 I'm late, I'm the last to arrive but 

00:05:00.430 --> 00:05:08.130
 come spectacular because clear when 

00:05:03.940 --> 00:05:08.130

00:05:09.030 --> 00:05:12.540
 we have one that comes out tomorrow 

00:05:14.180 --> 00:05:18.500
 but to the marq I bet my song because 

00:05:15.830 --> 00:05:21.520
 the music takes and the rest are 

00:05:18.500 --> 00:05:21.520
 pretty bad 

00:05:22.400 --> 00:05:32.870

 more but more and more in number and 

00:06:51.360 --> 00:06:55.200
 especially in quality every time 

00:06:52.830 --> 00:06:57.270

00:06:55.200 --> 00:07:00.330
 little more community this and that's what 

00:06:57.270 --> 00:07:03.420
