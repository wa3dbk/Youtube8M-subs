00:00:03.189 --> 00:00:08.100
Hi! For this look I decided to use a Kiko pigment I have never used before

00:00:08.100 --> 00:00:12.100
and I created this bright green look.

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:23.200
I start applying a primer to the lid.

00:00:43.200 --> 00:00:48.200
I use this Kiko pigment (an emerald green colour)

00:00:48.200 --> 00:00:59.200
and apply it to the lid (except the inner corner) with a wet brush.

00:01:19.300 --> 00:01:28.300
Apply the same colour also along the lower lash line.

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:42.500
Apply an ivory e/s to the inner corner and the brow bone.

00:02:03.500 --> 00:02:13.200
Apply a brown e/s to the crease and blend well to the outer corner.

00:03:06.200 --> 00:03:20.200
Use a black e/s to intensify the outer corner and blend well to the crease.

00:04:12.700 --> 00:04:19.700
I use a primer as a glitter base.

00:04:20.300 --> 00:04:31.300
Apply it on the lower lash line and then apply the glitter on top.

00:05:06.300 --> 00:05:10.300
Line your eyes with an eyeliner

00:05:11.300 --> 00:05:18.200
I use a cream eyeliner and then a liquid one.

00:05:42.200 --> 00:05:56.100
I have done an eyeliner tutorial that you
can find clicking on the top left note.

00:06:05.100 --> 00:06:10.100
Create the inner wing with the same eyeliner

00:06:10.500 --> 00:06:25.500
and then apply the liquid eyeliner to make more perfect your wing.

00:06:39.500 --> 00:06:46.300
Apply a black pencil to the waterline

00:06:53.300 --> 00:07:02.300
and the apply mascara.

00:07:08.300 --> 00:07:15.300
Eventually apply also the falses to make more dramatic your eyes.

00:07:29.600 --> 00:07:34.600
This is the final look, I hope you like it &lt;3 Bye!
