00:00:09.530 --> 00:00:14.269
 the new caddy reaches the fourth 

00:00:11.790 --> 00:00:16.710
 generation and yet not distorting 

00:00:14.269 --> 00:00:18.539
 overly the basic platform 

00:00:16.710 --> 00:00:20.730
 operates significant changes 

00:00:18.539 --> 00:00:23.519
 especially with regards to the 

00:00:20.730 --> 00:00:25.560
 design can be seen from these new ones 

00:00:23.519 --> 00:00:28.019
 ribs of the front that has been 

00:00:25.560 --> 00:00:30.420
 extensively redesigned to look like 

00:00:28.019 --> 00:00:31.289
 more to the cars of the group 

00:00:30.420 --> 00:00:33.270
 volkswagen 

00:00:31.289 --> 00:00:36.420
 it can also be seen from the optical groups 

00:00:33.270 --> 00:00:38.579
 from the large radiator grille 

00:00:36.420 --> 00:00:41.100
 but the novelties of the new caddy are 

00:00:38.579 --> 00:00:44.280
 especially under this hood with the 

00:00:41.100 --> 00:00:46.379
 new engines all euro 6 

00:00:44.280 --> 00:00:48.899
 even the rear of the caddy was 

00:00:46.379 --> 00:00:51.210
 completely modified especially for 

00:00:48.899 --> 00:00:54.149
 as for the optical groups they are 

00:00:51.210 --> 00:00:55.379
 now more squared but above all for 

00:00:54.149 --> 00:00:58.260
 regarding the solution of the 

00:00:55.379 --> 00:01:01.140
 tailgate with two leaves that 

00:00:58.260 --> 00:01:03.239
 as you can see this is asymmetrical 

00:01:01.140 --> 00:01:04.830
 because in addition to facilitating operations 

00:01:03.239 --> 00:01:07.680
 loading and unloading 

00:01:04.830 --> 00:01:10.320
 maybe from the side of the sidewalk is 

00:01:07.680 --> 00:01:14.520
 You can also close the door a 

00:01:10.320 --> 00:01:17.159
 casement while keeping the light visible 

00:01:14.520 --> 00:01:19.710
 stop and the license plate while driving 

00:01:17.159 --> 00:01:23.600
 and this allows to transport objects 

00:01:19.710 --> 00:01:23.600
 even longer than the load compartment 

00:01:25.710 --> 00:01:31.240
 important exterior restyling but 

00:01:29.560 --> 00:01:33.430
 here too the hand of 

00:01:31.240 --> 00:01:35.890
 volkswagen is more and more heard 

00:01:33.430 --> 00:01:36.970
 looks more and more like a car more 

00:01:35.890 --> 00:01:39.850
 than a commercial vehicle 

00:01:36.970 --> 00:01:43.600
 starting from the multifunction steering wheel 

00:01:39.850 --> 00:01:46.090
 inherited from golf as well as for the 

00:01:43.600 --> 00:01:48.520
 radio navigation system that in 

00:01:46.090 --> 00:01:51.250
 this case is present but is optional 

00:01:48.520 --> 00:01:55.780
 in the market as well as the possibility of 

00:01:51.250 --> 00:01:57.789
 having taken 12 volt USB and aux 

00:01:55.780 --> 00:01:59.830
 above all this launching sub-roof 

00:01:57.789 --> 00:02:02.110
 than in the previous version of the caddy 

00:01:59.830 --> 00:02:04.720
 it didn't exist which is very convenient for 

00:02:02.110 --> 00:02:09.240
 store items in the cabin 

00:02:04.720 --> 00:02:09.240
 We have many things to take with you 

00:02:15.140 --> 00:02:20.450
 even in gear the hinge does not deny 

00:02:17.510 --> 00:02:22.880
 his car vein the position 

00:02:20.450 --> 00:02:24.170
 The steering wheel is very comfortable 

00:02:22.880 --> 00:02:26.569
 adjustable both in height and in 

00:02:24.170 --> 00:02:29.690
 depth allows us to find the 

00:02:26.569 --> 00:02:31.700
 right position just in front of the 

00:02:29.690 --> 00:02:35.150
 large windshield that offers one 

00:02:31.700 --> 00:02:36.290
 really important visibility despite 

00:02:35.150 --> 00:02:37.370
 however, it is a vehicle 

00:02:36.290 --> 00:02:39.230
 commercial 

00:02:37.370 --> 00:02:41.780
 suspension work was 

00:02:39.230 --> 00:02:45.230
 done very well so that while remaining 

00:02:41.780 --> 00:02:47.209
 a little bit stiff still a lot 

00:02:45.230 --> 00:02:48.709
 comfortable especially if you travel 

00:02:47.209 --> 00:02:51.800
 of extra-urban roads 

00:02:48.709 --> 00:02:53.720
 as in the case of this test we were talking 

00:02:51.800 --> 00:02:56.150
 before the engines the one that 

00:02:53.720 --> 00:02:59.480
 is driving at the moment is 102 

00:02:56.150 --> 00:03:02.239
 horses bluemotion the engine that 

00:02:59.480 --> 00:03:04.570
 I think it will be the most chosen especially if 

00:03:02.239 --> 00:03:07.880
 we want to use the caddy in his 

00:03:04.570 --> 00:03:10.130
 let's say preferred size ie the one 

00:03:07.880 --> 00:03:12.320
 of volkswagen city ​​deliveries 

00:03:10.130 --> 00:03:16.040
 accredit this motorization of 

00:03:12.320 --> 00:03:18.290
 consumption around 4.2 liters per 100 km 

00:03:16.040 --> 00:03:20.510
 perhaps also for this to a first 

00:03:18.290 --> 00:03:22.940
 contact may seem a little bit 

00:03:20.510 --> 00:03:25.910
 download at low speeds ie not 

00:03:22.940 --> 00:03:28.579
 the couple arrives instantly 

00:03:25.910 --> 00:03:30.920
 but just make a habit of the between 

00:03:28.579 --> 00:03:33.200
 gearbox is the accelerator that is found 

00:03:30.920 --> 00:03:36.170
 right away your size 

00:03:33.200 --> 00:03:38.900
 the 5-speed gearbox offers i 

00:03:36.170 --> 00:03:40.880
 relationships a little long so some 

00:03:38.900 --> 00:03:43.670
 time we are forced to do some climbing 

00:03:40.880 --> 00:03:46.400
 more to pick up the caddy of turns and 

00:03:43.670 --> 00:03:48.110
 let him take back the couple in 

00:03:46.400 --> 00:03:51.230
 however, this city could be translated 

00:03:48.110 --> 00:03:53.269
 also in a lowering of consumption in 

00:03:51.230 --> 00:03:55.850
 how much we are not forced to 

00:03:53.269 --> 00:03:58.100
 such impetuous accelerations in the 

00:03:55.850 --> 00:03:59.930
 the driveability of the caddy is complex 

00:03:58.100 --> 00:04:02.600
 it seems remarkably improved compared 

00:03:59.930 --> 00:04:05.870
 above the previous generation 

00:04:02.600 --> 00:04:08.120
 because of the perceived quality that in 

00:04:05.870 --> 00:04:10.670
 cabin we can appreciate through 

00:04:08.120 --> 00:04:13.280
 this steering wheel that really is to 

00:04:10.670 --> 00:04:15.140
 one of a sedan or for the system 

00:04:13.280 --> 00:04:17.200
 of radio navigation for the location 

00:04:15.140 --> 00:04:19.669
 of the exchange rate and for the possibility of 

00:04:17.200 --> 00:04:21.829
 find your position immediately 

00:04:19.669 --> 00:04:23.330
 guides you through the many settings of 

00:04:21.829 --> 00:04:26.139
 seat and 

00:04:23.330 --> 00:04:26.139
 steering wheel
