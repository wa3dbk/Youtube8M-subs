00:00:00.729 --> 00:00:01.730
A friend asked me for help.

00:00:01.730 --> 00:00:04.880
She’s a coach, and was selling a high end
coaching package.

00:00:04.880 --> 00:00:06.700
She needed help with her sales copy.

00:00:06.700 --> 00:00:07.700
So she came to me.

00:00:07.700 --> 00:00:11.879
I'm Derek Halpern, and you're watching Social
Triggers, the place entrepreneurs and executives

00:00:11.879 --> 00:00:13.679
learn to get ahead in business and life.

00:00:13.679 --> 00:00:17.000
And in this video, I’ll share the advice
I gave to my friend.

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:28.810
And then I'll show you how this one important
tip can dramatically improve your sales copy.

00:00:28.810 --> 00:00:33.010
When my friend came to me asking for help
with her sales copy, I first needed to understand

00:00:33.010 --> 00:00:36.700
exactly what she was selling and why it was
so expensive.

00:00:36.700 --> 00:00:39.320
But when I asked her, all she said was:

00:00:39.320 --> 00:00:43.170
“This package includes one on one time with
me for a full year.”

00:00:43.170 --> 00:00:47.430
It was expensive because it included a lot
of one on one time.

00:00:47.430 --> 00:00:48.690
Makes sense, right?

00:00:48.690 --> 00:00:49.690
WRONG.

00:00:49.690 --> 00:00:50.690
So I asked her:

00:00:50.690 --> 00:00:55.160
"If I have that much money, why do I want
to spend a full year sitting around talking

00:00:55.160 --> 00:00:56.160
to you each month?

00:00:56.160 --> 00:00:58.379
That sounds like a big waste of time."

00:00:58.379 --> 00:01:03.539
She laughed and said, "Well, one on one time
allows me to work through the problem.

00:01:03.539 --> 00:01:04.680
And I can help them with..."

00:01:04.680 --> 00:01:06.080
And I interrupted her.

00:01:06.080 --> 00:01:08.090
“SAY THAT INSTEAD.”

00:01:08.090 --> 00:01:09.090
Here's the deal:

00:01:09.090 --> 00:01:13.330
When you're looking to sell what you do, YES,
you need to tell people what they'll get.

00:01:13.330 --> 00:01:17.900
But you also need to tell them what it will
do, how it will benefit them, and why they

00:01:17.900 --> 00:01:19.240
should care about it.

00:01:19.240 --> 00:01:23.030
And in my experience, people forget to take
this second step.

00:01:23.030 --> 00:01:25.330
They stop at "what they'll get."

00:01:25.330 --> 00:01:26.340
They say things like:

00:01:26.340 --> 00:01:28.770
"You'll get 2 one hour calls with me each
month."

00:01:28.770 --> 00:01:30.790
Or "You'll get 3 logo variations."

00:01:30.790 --> 00:01:33.210
Or "You'll get 10 hours of video content."

00:01:33.210 --> 00:01:34.210
And that's it.

00:01:34.210 --> 00:01:35.210
Guess what?

00:01:35.210 --> 00:01:36.210
NOBODY CARES.

00:01:36.210 --> 00:01:39.570
Because what they'll get is not nearly as
persuasive as what it will do.

00:01:39.570 --> 00:01:40.780
So, instead of saying:

00:01:40.780 --> 00:01:43.560
“You’ll get 2 one hour calls with me each
month.”

00:01:43.560 --> 00:01:44.670
Say something like:

00:01:44.670 --> 00:01:47.100
"You'll get 2 one hour calls with me each
month.

00:01:47.100 --> 00:01:51.800
You should come prepared with your most troubling
roadblock, and I'll work through it with you."

00:01:51.800 --> 00:01:53.380
Sure, that could be stronger.

00:01:53.380 --> 00:01:56.920
But the point is that you don’t want to
stop at “what they’ll get.”

00:01:56.920 --> 00:02:00.280
You want to tell them why the call matters.

00:02:00.280 --> 00:02:03.490
And most important, why it benefits them.

00:02:03.490 --> 00:02:05.410
As another example, instead of just saying:

00:02:05.410 --> 00:02:07.600
“You’ll get 3 logo variations.”

00:02:07.600 --> 00:02:08.900
You should say something like:

00:02:08.900 --> 00:02:12.480
"I'm a designer, so I know people have different
design tastes.

00:02:12.480 --> 00:02:17.569
I offer 3 logo variations to ensure we create
a logo you'll love."

00:02:17.569 --> 00:02:18.920
Again, it could be better.

00:02:18.920 --> 00:02:24.590
But you can see how that's much more powerful
than just "you get 3 logo variations."

00:02:24.590 --> 00:02:29.299
Now at this point, a skeptic always says:
"Well, Derek, that's common sense."

00:02:29.299 --> 00:02:31.489
And I laugh at those people.

00:02:31.489 --> 00:02:32.680
BECAUSE IT ISN'T.

00:02:32.680 --> 00:02:33.769
People are busy.

00:02:33.769 --> 00:02:34.769
People are skimming.

00:02:34.769 --> 00:02:38.129
They might read, “3 logo variations” and
think “That sounds excessive.

00:02:38.129 --> 00:02:39.269
I don’t need all that.”

00:02:39.269 --> 00:02:44.519
But if you explain WHY you offer 3 logo variations,
they’ll think: “This designer really wants

00:02:44.519 --> 00:02:47.749
to ensure that I get a design that I love.

00:02:47.749 --> 00:02:50.549
This sounds like the perfect person to work
with.”

00:02:50.549 --> 00:02:53.420
You don’t want to let people come up with
their own reason why.

00:02:53.420 --> 00:02:57.810
If you do, they may come up with something
completely different, or something that isn’t

00:02:57.810 --> 00:03:01.150
nearly as powerful as the reason you originally
intended.

00:03:01.150 --> 00:03:05.780
So you can let people tell your story for
you or you can tell your own story.

00:03:05.780 --> 00:03:06.780
The latter is better.

00:03:06.780 --> 00:03:10.290
So, if you want to write better sales copy
today, remember this:

00:03:10.290 --> 00:03:12.560
Yes, you need to tell people what they’ll
get.

00:03:12.560 --> 00:03:17.810
But you also must tell people what it will
do and how it will benefit them.

00:03:17.810 --> 00:03:21.019
Now go do that!

00:03:21.019 --> 00:03:22.019
Just kidding...

00:03:22.019 --> 00:03:23.019
I have a question for you:

00:03:23.019 --> 00:03:24.019
Have you made this mistake before?

00:03:24.019 --> 00:03:25.459
I’m betting the answer is yes.

00:03:25.459 --> 00:03:27.650
We all have made this mistake at some point.

00:03:27.650 --> 00:03:29.189
So, here's what I want you to do:

00:03:29.189 --> 00:03:32.220
In the comments below, I want you to post
two things:

00:03:32.220 --> 00:03:36.370
First, tell me what you had on one of your
product or service pages.

00:03:36.370 --> 00:03:41.549
Then, tell me what you plan to change it to
now that you've watched this video.

00:03:41.549 --> 00:03:43.050
I can’t wait to read it!

00:03:43.050 --> 00:03:47.959
