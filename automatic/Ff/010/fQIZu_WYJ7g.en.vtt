really annoying to use but anyway you

00:00:35.019 --> 00:00:36.869 
really annoying to use but anyway you
see<00:00:35.199> these<00:00:35.350> buttons<00:00:35.769> i<00:00:36.100> mentioned<00:00:36.850> that

00:00:36.869 --> 00:00:36.879 
see these buttons i mentioned that

00:00:36.879 --> 00:00:38.160 
see these buttons i mentioned that
they're<00:00:37.090> completely<00:00:37.449> flat<00:00:37.809> so<00:00:38.019> they're

00:00:38.160 --> 00:00:38.170 
they're completely flat so they're

00:00:38.170 --> 00:00:40.500 
they're completely flat so they're
touch-based<00:00:38.410> right<00:00:39.010> they<00:00:39.550> actually<00:00:40.149> have<00:00:40.329> the

00:00:40.500 --> 00:00:40.510 
touch-based right they actually have the

00:00:40.510 --> 00:00:42.900 
touch-based right they actually have the
same<00:00:40.780> characteristic<00:00:41.770> as<00:00:41.920> the<00:00:42.340> touchscreen

00:00:42.900 --> 00:00:42.910 
same characteristic as the touchscreen

00:00:42.910 --> 00:00:44.639 
same characteristic as the touchscreen
so<00:00:43.180> you<00:00:43.630> know<00:00:43.750> if<00:00:43.899> you<00:00:44.020> ever<00:00:44.170> tilt<00:00:44.500> your<00:00:44.590> device

00:00:44.639 --> 00:00:44.649 
so you know if you ever tilt your device

00:00:44.649 --> 00:00:46.410 
so you know if you ever tilt your device
to<00:00:44.920> the<00:00:45.160> side<00:00:45.370> and<00:00:45.550> you<00:00:45.640> touch<00:00:45.820> the<00:00:46.030> screen<00:00:46.059> you

00:00:46.410 --> 00:00:46.420 
to the side and you touch the screen you

00:00:46.420 --> 00:00:49.940 
to the side and you touch the screen you
can<00:00:46.510> see<00:00:46.750> the<00:00:46.899> kind<00:00:47.110> of<00:00:47.940> the<00:00:48.940> the<00:00:49.180> colors<00:00:49.510> Bend

00:00:49.940 --> 00:00:49.950 
can see the kind of the the colors Bend

00:00:49.950 --> 00:00:52.410 
can see the kind of the the colors Bend
because<00:00:50.950> it's<00:00:51.190> pushing<00:00:51.520> down<00:00:51.879> on<00:00:51.910> the<00:00:52.120> screen

00:00:52.410 --> 00:00:52.420 
because it's pushing down on the screen

00:00:52.420 --> 00:00:54.720 
because it's pushing down on the screen
the<00:00:52.809> screen<00:00:52.930> actually<00:00:53.289> has<00:00:53.649> some<00:00:53.829> play<00:00:54.100> the

00:00:54.720 --> 00:00:54.730 
the screen actually has some play the

00:00:54.730 --> 00:00:56.459 
the screen actually has some play the
same<00:00:55.120> thing<00:00:55.570> can<00:00:55.809> be<00:00:55.870> said<00:00:55.960> about<00:00:56.230> these

00:00:56.459 --> 00:00:56.469 
same thing can be said about these

00:00:56.469 --> 00:00:59.189 
same thing can be said about these
buttons<00:00:56.800> they<00:00:57.399> use<00:00:57.789> resistive<00:00:58.480> touchscreen

00:00:59.189 --> 00:00:59.199 
buttons they use resistive touchscreen

00:00:59.199 --> 00:01:01.049 
buttons they use resistive touchscreen
technology<00:00:59.410> which<00:01:00.190> means<00:01:00.460> the<00:01:00.610> two<00:01:00.789> layers

00:01:01.049 --> 00:01:01.059 
technology which means the two layers

00:01:01.059 --> 00:01:03.299 
technology which means the two layers
touch<00:01:01.510> each<00:01:01.690> other<00:01:01.930> underneath<00:01:02.739> the<00:01:02.980> button

00:01:03.299 --> 00:01:03.309 
touch each other underneath the button

00:01:03.309 --> 00:01:05.310 
touch each other underneath the button
and<00:01:03.520> that's<00:01:03.910> how<00:01:04.149> the<00:01:04.570> device<00:01:04.839> knows<00:01:05.110> that

00:01:05.310 --> 00:01:05.320 
and that's how the device knows that

00:01:05.320 --> 00:01:09.300 
and that's how the device knows that
it's<00:01:05.560> registered<00:01:06.160> a<00:01:06.340> button<00:01:07.149> press<00:01:07.979> so<00:01:08.979> they

00:01:09.300 --> 00:01:09.310 
it's registered a button press so they

00:01:09.310 --> 00:01:10.800 
it's registered a button press so they
require<00:01:09.700> a<00:01:09.729> little<00:01:09.970> bit<00:01:10.119> of<00:01:10.270> pressure<00:01:10.479> to<00:01:10.690> get

00:01:10.800 --> 00:01:10.810 
require a little bit of pressure to get

00:01:10.810 --> 00:01:13.560 
require a little bit of pressure to get
them<00:01:10.960> activated<00:01:11.140> but<00:01:11.619> not<00:01:11.799> too<00:01:12.010> much<00:01:12.420> here<00:01:13.420> we

00:01:13.560 --> 00:01:13.570 
them activated but not too much here we

00:01:13.570 --> 00:01:15.570 
them activated but not too much here we
have<00:01:13.659> a<00:01:13.720> d-pad<00:01:14.229> and<00:01:14.530> it<00:01:14.950> takes<00:01:15.189> a<00:01:15.310> little<00:01:15.430> bit

00:01:15.570 --> 00:01:15.580 
have a d-pad and it takes a little bit

00:01:15.580 --> 00:01:17.969 
have a d-pad and it takes a little bit
of<00:01:15.640> getting<00:01:15.820> used<00:01:15.939> to<00:01:16.210> to<00:01:16.450> not<00:01:17.229> have<00:01:17.470> not<00:01:17.799> be

00:01:17.969 --> 00:01:17.979 
of getting used to to not have not be

00:01:17.979 --> 00:01:19.620 
of getting used to to not have not be
able<00:01:18.100> to<00:01:18.369> feel<00:01:18.580> for<00:01:18.820> the<00:01:18.909> the<00:01:19.180> edges<00:01:19.479> of<00:01:19.510> the

00:01:19.620 --> 00:01:19.630 
able to feel for the the edges of the

00:01:19.630 --> 00:01:21.960 
able to feel for the the edges of the
button<00:01:20.070> let's<00:01:21.070> see<00:01:21.189> we<00:01:21.310> have<00:01:21.400> a<00:01:21.430> home<00:01:21.670> button

00:01:21.960 --> 00:01:21.970 
button let's see we have a home button

00:01:21.970 --> 00:01:23.730 
button let's see we have a home button
which<00:01:22.240> takes<00:01:22.450> you<00:01:22.659> back<00:01:22.810> to<00:01:22.869> the<00:01:23.049> now<00:01:23.259> screen

00:01:23.730 --> 00:01:23.740 
which takes you back to the now screen

00:01:23.740 --> 00:01:26.969 
which takes you back to the now screen

completely<00:01:27.580> useless<00:01:28.020> a<00:01:29.020> soft<00:01:29.710> key<00:01:29.920> buttons

00:01:30.270 --> 00:01:30.280 
completely useless a soft key buttons

00:01:30.280 --> 00:01:31.859 
completely useless a soft key buttons
the<00:01:30.729> reason<00:01:30.909> i<00:01:30.970> say<00:01:31.119> that<00:01:31.150> they're<00:01:31.390> useless<00:01:31.630> is

00:01:31.859 --> 00:01:31.869 
the reason i say that they're useless is

00:01:31.869 --> 00:01:34.289 
the reason i say that they're useless is
because<00:01:32.140> just<00:01:32.830> you<00:01:33.280> know<00:01:33.369> three<00:01:33.790> millimeters

00:01:34.289 --> 00:01:34.299 
because just you know three millimeters

00:01:34.299 --> 00:01:36.270 
because just you know three millimeters
above<00:01:34.450> that<00:01:34.810> you<00:01:34.990> can<00:01:35.140> press<00:01:35.470> on<00:01:35.740> the<00:01:35.860> actual

00:01:36.270 --> 00:01:36.280 
above that you can press on the actual

00:01:36.280 --> 00:01:39.510 
above that you can press on the actual
screen<00:01:37.150> to<00:01:37.420> get<00:01:37.600> that<00:01:37.840> soft<00:01:38.290> function<00:01:39.159> to<00:01:39.310> work

00:01:39.510 --> 00:01:39.520 
screen to get that soft function to work

00:01:39.520 --> 00:01:41.819 
screen to get that soft function to work
here<00:01:40.090> we<00:01:40.210> have<00:01:40.299> start<00:01:40.600> just<00:01:41.020> call<00:01:41.290> start<00:01:41.650> and

the device with my left hand I use my

00:02:11.079 --> 00:02:12.780 
the device with my left hand I use my
thumb<00:02:11.290> to<00:02:11.440> tap<00:02:11.650> on<00:02:11.799> the<00:02:11.920> tap<00:02:12.340> on<00:02:12.459> the<00:02:12.549> device

you<00:05:15.720> can<00:05:15.840> go<00:05:15.960> pretty<00:05:16.260> fast<00:05:16.650> you<00:05:17.010> could<00:05:17.130> stop<00:05:17.460> it

00:05:17.630 --> 00:05:17.640

00:05:19.130 --> 00:05:19.140 
very quickly you have to you have to

00:05:19.140 --> 00:05:21.530 
very quickly you have to you have to
double<00:05:19.470> click<00:05:19.560> on<00:05:19.740> the<00:05:19.860> screen<00:05:20.190> and<00:05:20.730> I<00:05:21.330> think

00:05:21.530 --> 00:05:21.540 
double click on the screen and I think

00:05:21.540 --> 00:05:22.760 
double click on the screen and I think
this<00:05:21.600> probably<00:05:21.810> works<00:05:22.080> a<00:05:22.200> lot<00:05:22.350> better<00:05:22.410> with<00:05:22.710> a

00:05:27.850 --> 00:05:27.860 
stylus to highlight text yes exactly and
