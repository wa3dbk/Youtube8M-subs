that position you can move the scale all
over<00:01:50.200> the<00:01:50.290> place<00:01:50.500> but<00:01:50.650> I<00:01:50.710> only<00:01:50.920> use<00:01:51.040> the<00:01:51.250> D<00:01:51.400> a

00:01:51.420 --> 00:01:51.430 
over the place but I only use the D a

00:01:51.430 --> 00:01:54.060 
over the place but I only use the D a
position<00:01:52.030> check<00:01:52.630> it<00:01:52.780> out<00:01:52.990> that's<00:01:53.560> what<00:01:53.830> it<00:01:53.920> is

00:01:54.060 --> 00:01:54.070 
position check it out that's what it is

see other people play it with different
fingerings

00:02:07.260 --> 00:02:07.270 
fingerings

00:02:07.270 --> 00:02:09.149 
fingerings
fair<00:02:08.080> enough<00:02:08.200> there's<00:02:08.560> lots<00:02:08.739> of<00:02:08.860> different

00:02:09.149 --> 00:02:09.159 
fair enough there's lots of different

00:02:09.159 --> 00:02:11.940 
fair enough there's lots of different
fingerings<00:02:09.519> to<00:02:09.640> this<00:02:09.759> scale<00:02:10.030> but<00:02:10.810> this<00:02:11.620> is<00:02:11.799> the

00:02:11.940 --> 00:02:11.950 
fingerings to this scale but this is the

00:02:11.950 --> 00:02:13.890 
fingerings to this scale but this is the
most<00:02:12.099> basic<00:02:12.370> and<00:02:12.730> the<00:02:12.790> easiest<00:02:13.269> and<00:02:13.599> it's<00:02:13.810> a

00:02:13.890 --> 00:02:13.900 
most basic and the easiest and it's a

00:02:13.900 --> 00:02:17.130 
most basic and the easiest and it's a
very<00:02:14.140> good<00:02:14.349> start<00:02:14.680> and<00:02:14.890> if<00:02:15.819> you<00:02:16.060> go<00:02:16.450> with<00:02:16.780> my

00:02:17.130 --> 00:02:17.140 
very good start and if you go with my

00:02:17.140 --> 00:02:20.940 
very good start and if you go with my
fingering<00:02:17.650> here<00:02:17.890> the<00:02:18.010> way<00:02:18.129> I've<00:02:18.280> got<00:02:18.519> it<00:02:19.950> it

fingering here the way I've got it it

00:02:20.950 --> 00:02:23.399 
fingering here the way I've got it it
gives<00:02:21.400> you<00:02:21.610> other<00:02:21.760> opportunities<00:02:22.540> that<00:02:22.989> if

gives you other opportunities that if
you<00:02:23.590> use<00:02:23.739> like<00:02:23.980> say<00:02:24.159> for<00:02:24.310> example<00:02:24.700> a<00:02:24.760> lot<00:02:24.879> of

00:02:24.960 --> 00:02:24.970 
you use like say for example a lot of

00:02:24.970 --> 00:02:26.789 
you use like say for example a lot of
players<00:02:25.209> use<00:02:25.750> your<00:02:25.959> first<00:02:26.230> some<00:02:26.440> third<00:02:26.620> here

00:02:26.789 --> 00:02:26.799 
players use your first some third here

00:02:26.799 --> 00:02:28.830 
players use your first some third here
goes<00:02:26.920> to<00:02:27.010> pinkies<00:02:27.400> weak<00:02:27.640> and<00:02:27.970> use<00:02:28.420> their<00:02:28.659> first

00:02:28.830 --> 00:02:28.840 
goes to pinkies weak and use their first

00:02:28.840 --> 00:02:31.170 
goes to pinkies weak and use their first
and<00:02:29.109> third<00:02:29.349> to<00:02:30.099> get<00:02:30.249> the<00:02:30.370> first<00:02:30.609> two<00:02:30.760> notes<00:02:30.909> and

00:02:31.170 --> 00:02:31.180 
and third to get the first two notes and

00:02:31.180 --> 00:02:32.550 
and third to get the first two notes and
then<00:02:31.269> they<00:02:31.389> move<00:02:31.569> over<00:02:31.840> like<00:02:31.989> that<00:02:32.200> I<00:02:32.319> find

00:02:32.550 --> 00:02:32.560 
then they move over like that I find

00:02:32.560 --> 00:02:33.860 
then they move over like that I find
that<00:02:32.680> awkward<00:02:33.069> because

00:02:33.860 --> 00:02:33.870 
that awkward because

00:02:33.870 --> 00:02:35.780 
that awkward because
my<00:02:34.140> fingers<00:02:34.560> are<00:02:34.709> kind<00:02:34.830> of<00:02:34.950> short<00:02:35.280> and<00:02:35.489> I<00:02:35.760> want

each fret you know say don't move
outside<00:02:42.569> of<00:02:42.840> the<00:02:42.959> fret<00:02:43.230> they're<00:02:43.410> assigned<00:02:43.680> to

00:02:43.860 --> 00:02:46.040 
outside of the fret they're assigned to
and<00:02:44.190> then<00:02:44.700> now<00:02:45.000> I<00:02:45.030> can<00:02:45.300> apply<00:02:45.599> a<00:02:45.690> finger

00:02:46.040 --> 00:02:46.050 
and then now I can apply a finger

00:02:46.050 --> 00:02:48.170 
and then now I can apply a finger
pattern<00:02:46.379> to<00:02:46.590> it<00:02:46.709> and<00:02:46.860> I<00:02:47.190> could<00:02:47.370> go<00:02:47.489> like<00:02:47.700> first

00:02:48.170 --> 00:02:48.180 
pattern to it and I could go like first

00:02:57.860 --> 00:02:57.870 
see how my hand sits over the fret board

00:02:57.870 --> 00:03:01.369 
see how my hand sits over the fret board
ready<00:02:58.650> to<00:02:58.830> go<00:02:59.010> right<00:03:00.019> now<00:03:01.019> I<00:03:01.049> don't<00:03:01.170> always

00:03:01.369 --> 00:03:01.379 
ready to go right now I don't always

00:03:01.379 --> 00:03:04.130 
ready to go right now I don't always
play<00:03:01.799> like<00:03:02.040> that<00:03:02.280> but<00:03:02.970> it's<00:03:03.090> a<00:03:03.209> great<00:03:03.569> exercise

00:03:04.130 --> 00:03:04.140 
play like that but it's a great exercise

00:03:04.140 --> 00:03:09.920

00:03:11.750 --> 00:03:11.760 
other secret is to down up picking in

up down up down up

00:03:15.900 --> 00:03:17.270 
up down up down up
alternating<00:03:16.470> all<00:03:16.590> the<00:03:16.680> way<00:03:16.799> up<00:03:16.920> when<00:03:17.069> you<00:03:17.130> get

00:03:17.270 --> 00:03:17.280 
alternating all the way up when you get

00:03:17.280 --> 00:03:19.009 
alternating all the way up when you get
to<00:03:17.400> the<00:03:17.489> high<00:03:17.670> note<00:03:17.910> don't<00:03:18.540> repeat<00:03:18.870> the

00:03:19.009 --> 00:03:19.019 
to the high note don't repeat the

00:03:19.019 --> 00:03:21.140 
to the high note don't repeat the
highest<00:03:19.379> note<00:03:19.530> of<00:03:19.650> the<00:03:19.739> scale<00:03:19.890> just<00:03:20.610> come<00:03:20.940> back

00:03:21.140 --> 00:03:21.150 
highest note of the scale just come back

00:03:21.150 --> 00:03:24.259 
highest note of the scale just come back
down<00:03:21.769> so<00:03:22.769> send<00:03:23.190> all<00:03:23.340> the<00:03:23.459> way<00:03:23.549> to<00:03:23.610> the<00:03:23.730> top<00:03:24.030> and

00:03:24.259 --> 00:03:24.269 
down so send all the way to the top and

00:03:24.269 --> 00:03:27.650 
down so send all the way to the top and
then<00:03:24.360> come<00:03:24.599> back<00:03:24.629> down<00:03:25.879> and<00:03:26.879> it<00:03:27.000> goes<00:03:27.180> down<00:03:27.420> up

00:03:27.650 --> 00:03:27.660 
then come back down and it goes down up

00:03:27.660 --> 00:03:35.500 
then come back down and it goes down up
down<00:03:27.870> up<00:03:27.930> down<00:03:28.260> up<00:03:28.319> down<00:03:32.900> and<00:03:33.950> play<00:03:34.950> it<00:03:35.129> slow

00:03:35.500 --> 00:03:35.510 
down up down up down and play it slow

00:03:35.510 --> 00:03:46.160 
down up down up down and play it slow
the<00:03:36.510> idea<00:03:36.780> is<00:03:36.900> to<00:03:36.989> get<00:03:37.110> nice<00:03:37.379> even<00:03:39.079> though<00:03:45.170> and

00:03:46.160 --> 00:03:46.170 
the idea is to get nice even though and

00:03:46.170 --> 00:03:49.760 
the idea is to get nice even though and
it's<00:03:46.889> also<00:03:47.130> my<00:03:47.489> solace<00:03:47.910> scale

00:03:49.760 --> 00:03:49.770 
it's also my solace scale

00:03:49.770 --> 00:03:54.540 
it's also my solace scale
did<00:03:50.770> you<00:03:50.950> know<00:03:51.190> this<00:03:51.880> scale<00:03:52.180> is<00:03:53.070> the<00:03:54.070> father<00:03:54.370> of

00:03:54.540 --> 00:03:54.550 
did you know this scale is the father of

00:03:54.550 --> 00:04:11.770 
did you know this scale is the father of
many<00:03:54.970> risks

00:04:11.770 --> 00:04:11.780 

00:04:11.780 --> 00:04:17.640 

it's<00:04:12.780> all<00:04:12.959> pentatonic<00:04:13.590> minor

00:04:17.640 --> 00:04:17.650 

00:04:17.650 --> 00:04:26.590 

sounds<00:04:18.370> great<00:04:18.519> with<00:04:18.699> some<00:04:18.880> Distortion
