00:00:00.140 --> 00:00:02.960 

hey<00:00:01.140> Brett<00:00:01.500> contra<00:00:01.829> is<00:00:01.890> here<00:00:02.159> and<00:00:02.730> right<00:00:02.939> now

00:00:02.960 --> 00:00:02.970 
hey Brett contra is here and right now

00:00:02.970 --> 00:00:04.130 
hey Brett contra is here and right now
I'm<00:00:03.179> going<00:00:03.300> to<00:00:03.389> show<00:00:03.540> you<00:00:03.629> the<00:00:03.750> difference

00:00:04.130 --> 00:00:04.140 
I'm going to show you the difference

00:00:04.140 --> 00:00:06.800 
I'm going to show you the difference
between<00:00:04.200> how<00:00:05.009> I<00:00:05.310> perform<00:00:05.940> the<00:00:06.120> low<00:00:06.240> box<00:00:06.509> plot

00:00:06.800 --> 00:00:06.810 
between how I perform the low box plot

00:00:06.810 --> 00:00:08.660 
between how I perform the low box plot
and<00:00:07.049> the<00:00:07.170> eye<00:00:07.200> box<00:00:07.589> claw<00:00:07.890> because<00:00:08.069> I<00:00:08.309> do<00:00:08.370> them

00:00:08.660 --> 00:00:08.670 
and the eye box claw because I do them

00:00:08.670 --> 00:00:12.470 
and the eye box claw because I do them
differently<00:00:08.820> so<00:00:09.719> this<00:00:10.590> right<00:00:10.860> here<00:00:11.300> these<00:00:12.300> are

00:00:12.470 --> 00:00:12.480 
differently so this right here these are

00:00:12.480 --> 00:00:14.829 
differently so this right here these are
adjustable<00:00:13.110> and<00:00:13.139> going<00:00:13.349> from<00:00:13.469> elite<00:00:13.740> v<00:00:14.009> FTS

00:00:14.829 --> 00:00:14.839 
adjustable and going from elite v FTS

00:00:14.839 --> 00:00:17.689 
adjustable and going from elite v FTS
this<00:00:15.839> is<00:00:16.020> about<00:00:16.230> 11<00:00:16.680> inches<00:00:16.740> high<00:00:16.920> and<00:00:17.400> this<00:00:17.460> is

00:00:17.689 --> 00:00:17.699 
this is about 11 inches high and this is

00:00:17.699 --> 00:00:19.790 
this is about 11 inches high and this is
I<00:00:17.940> believe<00:00:18.390> 16<00:00:18.750> inches<00:00:19.109> high<00:00:19.289> so<00:00:19.320> there's

00:00:19.790 --> 00:00:19.800 
I believe 16 inches high so there's

00:00:19.800 --> 00:00:22.160 
I believe 16 inches high so there's
about<00:00:19.890> a<00:00:20.039> 5<00:00:20.369> inch<00:00:20.580> inch<00:00:20.880> differential<00:00:21.720> here

00:00:22.160 --> 00:00:22.170 
about a 5 inch inch differential here

00:00:22.170 --> 00:00:30.080 
about a 5 inch inch differential here
and<00:00:22.500> uh<00:00:24.289> so<00:00:25.289> like<00:00:26.189> I<00:00:26.490> have<00:00:27.300> the<00:00:27.480> box<00:00:28.220> angle<00:00:29.220> to

00:00:30.080 --> 00:00:30.090 
and uh so like I have the box angle to

00:00:30.090 --> 00:00:33.560 
and uh so like I have the box angle to
where<00:00:30.300> it's<00:00:31.019> not<00:00:31.800> straight<00:00:32.369> it's<00:00:32.610> dying<00:00:32.880> or<00:00:33.210> so

00:00:33.560 --> 00:00:33.570 
where it's not straight it's dying or so

00:00:33.570 --> 00:00:36.560 
where it's not straight it's dying or so
right<00:00:34.380> now<00:00:34.559> I'm<00:00:34.950> just<00:00:35.460> going<00:00:35.640> to<00:00:35.670> sit<00:00:36.000> down

pretty substantial forward trunk lean

00:01:30.659 --> 00:01:33.920 
pretty substantial forward trunk lean
but<00:01:31.290> notice<00:01:31.650> the<00:01:31.829> tibia<00:01:32.250> right<00:01:32.430> now<00:01:32.610> the<00:01:33.540> tibia

00:01:33.920 --> 00:01:33.930 
but notice the tibia right now the tibia

00:01:33.930 --> 00:01:37.219 
but notice the tibia right now the tibia
is<00:01:34.020> vertical<00:01:34.829> it's<00:01:35.189> straight<00:01:35.579> up<00:01:35.729> so<00:01:36.600> lean<00:01:37.020> in

00:01:37.219 --> 00:01:37.229 
is vertical it's straight up so lean in

00:01:37.229 --> 00:01:41.149 
is vertical it's straight up so lean in
get<00:01:37.439> an<00:01:37.530> arch<00:01:37.820> stand<00:01:38.820> up<00:01:38.970> sit<00:01:39.840> back<00:01:40.110> spread<00:01:41.040> the

00:01:41.149 --> 00:01:41.159 
get an arch stand up sit back spread the

00:01:41.159 --> 00:01:47.340 
get an arch stand up sit back spread the
knees<00:01:41.930> come<00:01:42.930> up<00:01:43.220> okay<00:01:44.220> so<00:01:44.600> the<00:01:45.600> things<00:01:45.990> on

00:01:47.340 --> 00:01:47.350 
knees come up okay so the things on

00:01:47.350 --> 00:01:50.280 
knees come up okay so the things on
need<00:01:48.070> to<00:01:48.190> be<00:01:48.340> aware<00:01:48.640> of<00:01:48.700> when<00:01:49.570> you<00:01:49.690> box<00:01:49.900> what

00:01:50.280 --> 00:01:50.290 
need to be aware of when you box what

00:01:50.290 --> 00:01:55.470 
need to be aware of when you box what
you<00:01:52.350> never<00:01:53.350> want<00:01:53.650> to<00:01:53.710> plop<00:01:54.120> because<00:01:55.120> if<00:01:55.360> you

00:01:55.470 --> 00:01:55.480 
you never want to plop because if you

00:01:55.480 --> 00:01:57.930 
you never want to plop because if you
plop<00:01:55.780> down<00:01:56.110> you've<00:01:57.100> got<00:01:57.280> all<00:01:57.400> that<00:01:57.550> force

00:01:57.930 --> 00:01:57.940 
plop down you've got all that force

00:01:57.940 --> 00:01:59.850 
plop down you've got all that force
crashing<00:01:58.570> down<00:01:58.780> which<00:01:59.260> creates<00:01:59.620> a<00:01:59.680> lot<00:01:59.800> of

00:01:59.850 --> 00:01:59.860 
crashing down which creates a lot of

00:01:59.860 --> 00:02:03.900 
crashing down which creates a lot of
stress<00:02:00.300> to<00:02:01.300> the<00:02:01.330> posterior<00:02:01.900> tissues<00:02:02.820> so<00:02:03.820> you

00:02:03.900 --> 00:02:03.910 
stress to the posterior tissues so you

00:02:03.910 --> 00:02:05.190 
stress to the posterior tissues so you
don't<00:02:04.030> want<00:02:04.150> to<00:02:04.240> do<00:02:04.330> that<00:02:04.450> don't<00:02:04.660> crash<00:02:04.930> down

00:02:05.190 --> 00:02:05.200 
don't want to do that don't crash down

00:02:05.200 --> 00:02:09.690 
don't want to do that don't crash down
always<00:02:06.210> land<00:02:07.210> nice<00:02:07.570> and<00:02:07.870> gently<00:02:08.200> and<00:02:08.550> then<00:02:09.550> the

00:02:09.690 --> 00:02:09.700 
always land nice and gently and then the

00:02:09.700 --> 00:02:11.640 
always land nice and gently and then the
other<00:02:09.850> thing<00:02:10.119> is<00:02:10.150> this<00:02:11.140> is<00:02:11.200> the<00:02:11.470> most

00:02:11.640 --> 00:02:11.650 
other thing is this is the most

00:02:11.650 --> 00:02:14.610 
other thing is this is the most
important<00:02:12.130> thing<00:02:12.600> see<00:02:13.600> my<00:02:13.750> lumbar<00:02:14.080> spine<00:02:14.380> has
