tape just at ace hardware and I'm going
to<00:02:18.459> go<00:02:18.640> ahead<00:02:18.670> and<00:02:18.850> cut<00:02:19.150> it<00:02:19.240> in<00:02:19.360> half<00:02:19.390> and<00:02:19.900> put

to go ahead and cut it in half and put
it<00:02:20.770> over<00:02:20.890> the<00:02:21.160> edge<00:02:21.280> of<00:02:21.430> the<00:02:21.550> shelving<00:02:21.970> so<00:02:22.600> what

00:02:22.740 --> 00:02:22.750 
it over the edge of the shelving so what

00:02:22.750 --> 00:02:25.260 
it over the edge of the shelving so what
I've<00:02:22.870> done<00:02:22.900> is<00:02:23.110> I've<00:02:23.470> cut<00:02:24.430> off<00:02:24.550> a<00:02:24.580> piece<00:02:24.910> long

00:02:25.260 --> 00:02:25.270 
I've done is I've cut off a piece long

00:02:25.270 --> 00:02:27.120 
I've done is I've cut off a piece long
enough<00:02:25.540> to<00:02:25.660> go<00:02:25.780> all<00:02:25.810> the<00:02:26.140> way<00:02:26.170> across<00:02:26.320> here<00:02:26.920> and

00:02:27.120 --> 00:02:27.130 
enough to go all the way across here and

00:02:27.130 --> 00:02:31.310 
enough to go all the way across here and
I<00:02:28.060> made<00:02:28.330> a<00:02:28.360> little<00:02:28.630> score<00:02:28.930> mark<00:02:29.230> in<00:02:29.440> the<00:02:30.250> edge

00:02:31.310 --> 00:02:31.320 
I made a little score mark in the edge

00:02:31.320 --> 00:02:34.590 
I made a little score mark in the edge
you<00:02:32.320> see<00:02:32.500> this<00:02:32.650> in<00:02:32.890> the<00:02:33.760> bottom<00:02:34.239> of<00:02:34.300> the<00:02:34.420> tape

00:02:34.590 --> 00:02:34.600 
you see this in the bottom of the tape

00:02:34.600 --> 00:02:36.900 
you see this in the bottom of the tape
and<00:02:34.840> if<00:02:35.320> you<00:02:35.470> cut<00:02:35.920> it<00:02:36.070> and<00:02:36.250> then<00:02:36.519> you<00:02:36.640> start

00:02:36.900 --> 00:02:36.910 
and if you cut it and then you start

00:02:36.910 --> 00:02:43.430 
and if you cut it and then you start
pulling<00:02:37.120> it<00:02:37.420> it's<00:02:38.170> going<00:02:38.500> to<00:02:38.709> just<00:02:38.920> pull<00:02:39.340> right

00:02:43.430 --> 00:02:43.440

down<00:02:44.440> the<00:02:44.590> middle<00:02:44.620> and<00:02:44.980> I've<00:02:45.130> just<00:02:45.160> anchored

00:02:45.690 --> 00:02:45.700 
down the middle and I've just anchored

00:02:45.700 --> 00:02:47.280 
down the middle and I've just anchored
it<00:02:45.820> on<00:02:45.940> the<00:02:46.060> shelf<00:02:46.330> you<00:02:46.450> can<00:02:46.510> see<00:02:46.840> you<00:02:46.959> kind<00:02:47.200> of

it on the shelf you can see you kind of

00:02:47.290 --> 00:02:50.280 
it on the shelf you can see you kind of

been ripped in half you can tell that
this<00:03:01.570> is<00:03:01.750> the<00:03:01.870> part<00:03:02.110> that<00:03:02.140> was<00:03:02.380> ripped<00:03:02.620> and

00:03:02.729 --> 00:03:02.739

this was the straight part i want to put
the<00:03:04.840> straight<00:03:05.170> part<00:03:05.440> along<00:03:05.890> here<00:03:06.340> and<00:03:06.519> i'm

00:03:06.870 --> 00:03:06.880 
the straight part along here and i'm

00:03:06.880 --> 00:03:08.610 
the straight part along here and i'm
actually<00:03:07.060> working<00:03:07.360> upside<00:03:07.959> down<00:03:08.170> because<00:03:08.350> i'm

00:03:08.610 --> 00:03:08.620 
actually working upside down because i'm

00:03:08.620 --> 00:03:11.160 
actually working upside down because i'm
going<00:03:08.890> to<00:03:09.040> fold<00:03:09.340> the<00:03:10.030> strip<00:03:10.330> over<00:03:10.810> and<00:03:11.050> you

00:03:11.160 --> 00:03:11.170 
going to fold the strip over and you

00:03:11.170 --> 00:03:13.050 
going to fold the strip over and you
won't<00:03:11.380> nobody<00:03:11.530> will<00:03:11.830> see<00:03:12.010> that<00:03:12.190> so<00:03:12.730> what<00:03:12.910> I<00:03:12.940> do

00:03:13.050 --> 00:03:13.060 
won't nobody will see that so what I do

00:03:13.060 --> 00:03:16.920 
won't nobody will see that so what I do
is<00:03:13.239> I<00:03:13.480> start<00:03:13.510> over<00:03:14.019> here<00:03:14.350> and<00:03:15.390> I'm<00:03:16.390> just<00:03:16.450> going

00:03:16.920 --> 00:03:16.930 
is I start over here and I'm just going

00:03:16.930 --> 00:03:21.000 
is I start over here and I'm just going
to<00:03:18.630> line<00:03:19.630> up<00:03:19.840> the<00:03:20.080> edge<00:03:20.110> and<00:03:20.650> I'm<00:03:20.800> going<00:03:20.980> to

00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:21.010 
to line up the edge and I'm going to

00:03:21.010 --> 00:03:22.860 
to line up the edge and I'm going to
cover<00:03:21.280> this<00:03:21.550> up<00:03:21.760> later<00:03:22.090> so<00:03:22.239> it<00:03:22.540> won't<00:03:22.690> really

00:03:22.860 --> 00:03:22.870 
cover this up later so it won't really

00:03:22.870 --> 00:03:26.640 
cover this up later so it won't really
matter<00:03:23.400> just<00:03:24.400> making<00:03:24.820> sure<00:03:25.500> that<00:03:26.500> the

00:03:26.640 --> 00:03:26.650 
matter just making sure that the

00:03:26.650 --> 00:03:29.880 
matter just making sure that the
straight<00:03:26.950> edge<00:03:27.160> is<00:03:27.519> straight<00:03:27.880> along<00:03:28.239> here

00:03:29.880 --> 00:03:29.890 
straight edge is straight along here

00:03:29.890 --> 00:03:32.710 
straight edge is straight along here
I'm<00:03:30.890> just<00:03:31.760> going<00:03:31.910> to<00:03:31.940> go<00:03:32.060> through<00:03:32.090> and<00:03:32.390> just

00:03:32.710 --> 00:03:32.720 
I'm just going to go through and just

00:03:32.720 --> 00:03:39.570 
I'm just going to go through and just
kind<00:03:33.050> of<00:03:33.170> feel<00:03:34.150> and<00:03:35.150> tack<00:03:35.480> it<00:03:35.510> down<00:03:35.720> as<00:03:36.230> I<00:03:36.260> go

00:03:39.570 --> 00:03:39.580 

00:03:39.580 --> 00:03:41.950 

the<00:03:40.580> tape<00:03:40.760> is<00:03:40.910> pretty<00:03:41.180> forgiving<00:03:41.720> if<00:03:41.870> you

00:03:41.950 --> 00:03:41.960 
the tape is pretty forgiving if you

00:03:41.960 --> 00:03:44.740 
the tape is pretty forgiving if you
needed<00:03:42.260> to<00:03:42.410> pull<00:03:42.650> it<00:03:42.770> up<00:03:42.920> and<00:03:43.630> start<00:03:44.630> over

00:03:44.740 --> 00:03:44.750 
needed to pull it up and start over

00:03:44.750 --> 00:03:46.930 
needed to pull it up and start over
again<00:03:44.900> that's<00:03:45.740> why<00:03:45.920> I<00:03:45.950> just<00:03:46.280> want<00:03:46.430> to<00:03:46.520> tack<00:03:46.730> it

00:03:46.930 --> 00:03:46.940 
again that's why I just want to tack it

00:03:46.940 --> 00:04:00.980 
again that's why I just want to tack it
down

00:04:00.980 --> 00:04:00.990 

00:04:00.990 --> 00:04:03.590 

okay<00:04:01.710> so<00:04:02.490> then<00:04:02.670> you're<00:04:02.820> just<00:04:02.850> working<00:04:03.150> all<00:04:03.510> the

00:04:03.590 --> 00:04:03.600 
okay so then you're just working all the

00:04:03.600 --> 00:04:05.020 
okay so then you're just working all the
way<00:04:03.630> to<00:04:03.780> the<00:04:03.990> end<00:04:04.110> and<00:04:04.380> once<00:04:04.590> you're<00:04:04.770> satisfied

00:04:05.020 --> 00:04:05.030 
way to the end and once you're satisfied

00:04:05.030 --> 00:04:07.610 
way to the end and once you're satisfied
you<00:04:06.030> can<00:04:06.060> go<00:04:06.330> ahead<00:04:06.450> and<00:04:06.570> push<00:04:06.870> it<00:04:07.020> down<00:04:07.260> and

00:04:07.610 --> 00:04:07.620 
you can go ahead and push it down and

00:04:07.620 --> 00:04:11.600 
you can go ahead and push it down and
then<00:04:08.130> I<00:04:08.190> just<00:04:08.640> push<00:04:09.300> it<00:04:09.330> over<00:04:09.870> the<00:04:10.170> edge<00:04:11.040> all

00:04:11.600 --> 00:04:11.610 
then I just push it over the edge all

00:04:11.610 --> 00:04:13.910 
then I just push it over the edge all
across<00:04:12.000> like<00:04:12.810> I<00:04:12.930> said<00:04:13.140> no<00:04:13.350> one's<00:04:13.500> going<00:04:13.680> to<00:04:13.710> see

00:04:13.910 --> 00:04:13.920 
across like I said no one's going to see

00:04:13.920 --> 00:04:16.190 
across like I said no one's going to see
this<00:04:14.100> it's<00:04:15.030> a<00:04:15.090> lot<00:04:15.210> easier<00:04:15.450> than<00:04:15.720> trying<00:04:16.080> to

00:04:16.190 --> 00:04:16.200

00:04:38.180 --> 00:04:38.190 
looks great it's just up against the

00:04:38.190 --> 00:04:39.560 
looks great it's just up against the
wall<00:04:38.340> right<00:04:38.520> now<00:04:38.670> because<00:04:39.000> I<00:04:39.120> didn't<00:04:39.390> want<00:04:39.420> to

00:04:39.560 --> 00:04:39.570 
wall right now because I didn't want to

00:04:39.570 --> 00:04:41.630 
wall right now because I didn't want to
add<00:04:39.720> holes<00:04:40.020> to<00:04:40.260> the<00:04:40.290> wall<00:04:40.410> and<00:04:40.770> it's<00:04:41.370> pretty

00:04:41.630 --> 00:04:41.640

00:04:41.640 --> 00:04:44.840 
add holes to the wall and it's pretty
heavy<00:04:41.910> so<00:04:42.840> I<00:04:42.870> ended<00:04:43.380> up<00:04:43.500> covering<00:04:43.980> the<00:04:44.190> top<00:04:44.460> and

00:04:44.840 --> 00:04:44.850 
heavy so I ended up covering the top and
