00:00:06.160 --> 00:00:11.510
 every morning when we heard the call from 

00:00:09.200 --> 00:00:13.880
 communications we go down to the office of 

00:00:11.510 --> 00:00:15.740
 sergeants and we reviewed the 

00:00:13.880 --> 00:00:17.540
 equipment and materials of the 

00:00:15.740 --> 00:00:18.950
 trucks all in a team always always 

00:00:17.540 --> 00:00:20.720
 as a team here we can never work 

00:00:18.950 --> 00:00:22.700
 Alone that's very nice about philosophy 

00:00:20.720 --> 00:00:25.369
 of work of the firemen and if here 

00:00:22.700 --> 00:00:28.040
 we are a team we are a great family and 

00:00:25.369 --> 00:00:29.450
 without the team and if the teammates do not 

00:00:28.040 --> 00:00:31.189
 they could do nothing 

00:00:29.450 --> 00:00:32.780
 How many firefighters are you working on? 

00:00:31.189 --> 00:00:35.090
 this park now because today we will be 

00:00:32.780 --> 00:00:37.579
 about 25 what happens there is an exit to 

00:00:35.090 --> 00:00:40.280
 the first exit is making a 

00:00:37.579 --> 00:00:42.289
 see flacso practice and they are 

00:00:40.280 --> 00:00:44.690
 playing this moment to see how it happens 

00:00:42.289 --> 00:00:47.239
 review a vehicle then good now 

00:00:44.690 --> 00:00:48.649
 the partner will be reading exactly 

00:00:47.239 --> 00:00:50.870
 everything that is in the part of that 

00:00:48.649 --> 00:00:52.670
 have to have the vehicle we will go 

00:00:50.870 --> 00:00:54.589
 checking that everything is there if it is not 

00:00:52.670 --> 00:00:56.449
 goes to the warehouse and is replaced as soon as 

00:00:54.589 --> 00:00:59.449
 possible because if we went out to a 

00:00:56.449 --> 00:01:00.769
 Emergency can not be missed always 

00:00:59.449 --> 00:01:02.960
 try not to lose the earth in 

00:01:00.769 --> 00:01:05.089
 few things but it is simply a 

00:01:02.960 --> 00:01:06.920
 way also to remember and maintain 

00:01:05.089 --> 00:01:09.760
 the head wakes up to know 

00:01:06.920 --> 00:01:11.430
 quickly where is everything 4 

00:01:09.760 --> 00:01:15.020
 Y 

00:01:11.430 --> 00:01:15.020
 one third of 25 

00:01:18.049 --> 00:01:22.320
 one of the most popular tools 

00:01:20.159 --> 00:01:25.259
 the attention these are some pieces pinzas 

00:01:22.320 --> 00:01:27.539
 and what are they used for in principle with 

00:01:25.259 --> 00:01:30.720
 these pieces are used to take out or 

00:01:27.539 --> 00:01:32.039
 to open the vehicles when plates 

00:01:30.720 --> 00:01:34.770
 of cars apart cars 

00:01:32.039 --> 00:01:37.080
 exactly has a lot of force then 

00:01:34.770 --> 00:01:38.939
 we use them to spend the 

00:01:37.080 --> 00:01:41.250
 in what would be the doors of the 

00:01:38.939 --> 00:01:42.810
 cars and thanks to the forge that comes to 

00:01:41.250 --> 00:01:44.070
 open and provide us access because 

00:01:42.810 --> 00:01:46.140
 many times in accidents of 

00:01:44.070 --> 00:01:49.259
 traffic the main problem is that 

00:01:46.140 --> 00:01:51.959
 we can access the original and it 's like this 

00:01:49.259 --> 00:01:55.259
 that if the shear is the exact this 

00:01:51.959 --> 00:01:57.959
 short that supports a lot if with this 

00:01:55.259 --> 00:02:00.420
 what we use is mainly for 

00:01:57.959 --> 00:02:02.729
 cut the pillars of the vehicle and 

00:02:00.420 --> 00:02:05.429
 to descap it and to be able to access much more 

00:02:02.729 --> 00:02:08.190
 easy to the victim and thus be able to extract 

00:02:05.429 --> 00:02:10.530
 the victim in the best possible way 

00:02:08.190 --> 00:02:13.349
 so putting a rescue table and 

00:02:10.530 --> 00:02:15.060
 taking it out horizontally in the 

00:02:13.349 --> 00:02:16.799
 inside the park we see all our 

00:02:15.060 --> 00:02:18.870
 people intervention of all firefighters 

00:02:16.799 --> 00:02:20.700
 Of course this is very important we know 

00:02:18.870 --> 00:02:22.620
 since you have it by hand because in 

00:02:20.700 --> 00:02:24.480
 how much is an exit 

00:02:22.620 --> 00:02:26.940
 they tell us all and here we have to go 

00:02:24.480 --> 00:02:28.290
 change very fast today and 

00:02:26.940 --> 00:02:30.150
 get on the truck to get there before 

00:02:28.290 --> 00:02:31.769
 possible and not to leave the pants has already 

00:02:30.150 --> 00:02:33.659
 put in the drops without yes yes this 

00:02:31.769 --> 00:02:36.360
 It seems very movie but it 's like that 

00:02:33.659 --> 00:02:37.940
 we come to the internet is within the 

00:02:36.360 --> 00:02:40.860
 trousers you put on the suspenders and 

00:02:37.940 --> 00:02:43.519
 jacket and running to the vehicle and the 

00:02:40.860 --> 00:02:47.159
 the first time you saw your name in a 

00:02:43.519 --> 00:02:48.989
 I brought your old man who feels the truth 

00:02:47.159 --> 00:02:51.180
 I was very happy, it made me very happy 

00:02:48.989 --> 00:02:53.280
 illusion I do not know other colleagues but 

00:02:51.180 --> 00:02:54.780
 the first of seven is a suit 

00:02:53.280 --> 00:02:56.489
 intervention with your name you say good 

00:02:54.780 --> 00:02:59.700
 first what has been achieved that costs a lot 

00:02:56.489 --> 00:03:00.840
 get here and then you feel very 

00:02:59.700 --> 00:03:02.670
 happy about it very well I was 

00:03:00.840 --> 00:03:05.340
 very happy in your six years of 

00:03:02.670 --> 00:03:08.280
 service and the hardest moment the 

00:03:05.340 --> 00:03:10.950
 hardest time for when there 

00:03:08.280 --> 00:03:13.680
 contact with families because 

00:03:10.950 --> 00:03:16.519
 normally we arrived a little 

00:03:13.680 --> 00:03:18.720
 like the 7th cavalry we work and 

00:03:16.519 --> 00:03:20.970
 we finish what we have to finish and 

00:03:18.720 --> 00:03:22.130
 we all go together for the 

00:03:20.970 --> 00:03:24.520
 Park 

00:03:22.130 --> 00:03:27.760
 but there are certain services that 

00:03:24.520 --> 00:03:29.800
 that do not lead to that speed and that you 

00:03:27.760 --> 00:03:32.290
 relate or are you some time with the 

00:03:29.800 --> 00:03:36.190
 families of those affected families 

00:03:32.290 --> 00:03:37.780
 are directly affected and that's what 

00:03:36.190 --> 00:03:39.040
 that what touches more as soon as you 

00:03:37.780 --> 00:03:40.660
 you involve a bit in the story not 

00:03:39.040 --> 00:03:43.630
 exact jump in terms of empathy 

00:03:40.660 --> 00:03:47.380
 he starts playing he starts playing that his 

00:03:43.630 --> 00:03:50.620
 paper since you already feel closer and 

00:03:47.380 --> 00:03:52.870
 they are already hard stories and while not 

00:03:50.620 --> 00:03:56.500
 they leave an exit because it is necessary to take advantage 

00:03:52.870 --> 00:03:59.350
 the exact time and take advantage of the time 

00:03:56.500 --> 00:04:00.970
 to go down to the gym to do a little 

00:03:59.350 --> 00:04:02.830
 of exercise is thank you very much this 

00:04:00.970 --> 00:04:05.200
 we know that these firefighters 

00:04:02.830 --> 00:04:08.610
 they can be trained for others 

00:04:05.200 --> 00:04:08.610
 so many hundred years of history
