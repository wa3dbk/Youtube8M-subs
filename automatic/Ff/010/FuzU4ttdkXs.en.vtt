a<00:00:00.170> couple<00:00:01.170> of<00:00:01.230> weeks<00:00:01.290> ago<00:00:01.439> we<00:00:01.620> ran<00:00:01.860> a<00:00:02.129> feature

00:00:02.480 --> 00:00:02.490 
a couple of weeks ago we ran a feature

00:00:02.490 --> 00:00:03.379 
a couple of weeks ago we ran a feature
called

00:00:03.379 --> 00:00:03.389 
called

00:00:03.389 --> 00:00:05.480 
called
gmail<00:00:04.080> request<00:00:04.500> features<00:00:04.830> actually<00:00:05.130> what<00:00:05.400> it

00:00:05.480 --> 00:00:05.490 
gmail request features actually what it

gmail request features actually what it
was<00:00:05.580> called<00:00:05.759> and<00:00:06.240> we<00:00:06.330> essentially<00:00:06.600> suggested

00:00:07.430 --> 00:00:07.440 
was called and we essentially suggested

00:00:07.440 --> 00:00:09.950 
was called and we essentially suggested
that<00:00:07.620> Google<00:00:07.950> add<00:00:08.099> a<00:00:08.130> third<00:00:08.670> button<00:00:09.030> to<00:00:09.450> Gmail

00:00:09.950 --> 00:00:09.960

00:00:11.600 --> 00:00:11.610 
notifications so when you swipe down

00:00:11.610 --> 00:00:13.610 
notifications so when you swipe down
from<00:00:11.639> the<00:00:12.240> pull<00:00:12.960> down<00:00:13.139> menu<00:00:13.440> you're

00:00:13.610 --> 00:00:13.620 
from the pull down menu you're

00:00:13.620 --> 00:00:15.079 
from the pull down menu you're
essentially<00:00:13.980> getting<00:00:14.160> a<00:00:14.309> third<00:00:14.549> button<00:00:14.820> which

00:00:15.079 --> 00:00:15.089 
essentially getting a third button which

00:00:15.089 --> 00:00:17.060 
essentially getting a third button which
could<00:00:15.240> be<00:00:15.389> forward<00:00:16.049> or<00:00:16.350> markers<00:00:16.830> read

00:00:17.060 --> 00:00:17.070 
could be forward or markers read

00:00:17.070 --> 00:00:18.890 
could be forward or markers read
something<00:00:17.490> to<00:00:17.580> just<00:00:17.760> add<00:00:17.940> to<00:00:18.240> the<00:00:18.270> power<00:00:18.630> there

00:00:18.890 --> 00:00:18.900 
something to just add to the power there

00:00:18.900 --> 00:00:21.080 
something to just add to the power there
so<00:00:19.380> we're<00:00:19.529> sort<00:00:19.800> of<00:00:19.949> sort<00:00:20.130> of<00:00:20.189> continuing<00:00:20.850> on

00:00:21.080 --> 00:00:21.090
