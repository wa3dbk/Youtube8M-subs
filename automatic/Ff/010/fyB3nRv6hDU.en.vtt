00:02:25.890 --> 00:02:29.370 
all right so that's this is J and then D
so<00:02:26.890> that<00:02:27.040> the<00:02:27.250> chord<00:02:27.430> progression<00:02:27.910> is<00:02:28.030> G<00:02:28.390> D<00:02:28.930> D

00:02:29.370 --> 00:02:29.380 
so that the chord progression is G D D

00:02:29.380 --> 00:02:36.150 
so that the chord progression is G D D
minor<00:02:29.620> and<00:02:29.800> then<00:02:30.100> C<00:02:30.630> so<00:02:31.630> G<00:02:33.210> D<00:02:34.210> or<00:02:35.200> you<00:02:35.890> can<00:02:36.040> make

00:02:36.150 --> 00:02:36.160 
minor and then C so G D or you can make

00:02:36.160 --> 00:02:39.660 
minor and then C so G D or you can make
a<00:02:36.190> pinky<00:02:36.460> on<00:02:36.870> which<00:02:37.870> is<00:02:38.050> it's<00:02:38.500> D<00:02:38.950> suspended<00:02:39.520> and

00:02:39.660 --> 00:02:39.670 
a pinky on which is it's D suspended and

00:02:39.670 --> 00:02:41.700 
a pinky on which is it's D suspended and
then<00:02:40.150> you<00:02:40.240> can<00:02:40.360> switch<00:02:40.540> to<00:02:40.690> an<00:02:40.780> e<00:02:41.050> and<00:02:41.290> that's

00:02:41.700 --> 00:02:41.710 
then you can switch to an e and that's

00:02:41.710 --> 00:02:44.280 
then you can switch to an e and that's
gonna<00:02:41.860> be<00:02:42.130> the<00:02:42.640> second<00:02:43.330> fret<00:02:43.750> of<00:02:43.780> the<00:02:44.020> 2nd

00:02:44.280 --> 00:02:44.290 
gonna be the second fret of the 2nd

00:02:44.290 --> 00:02:46.650 
gonna be the second fret of the 2nd
string<00:02:44.400> 2nd<00:02:45.400> fret<00:02:45.430> of<00:02:45.580> the<00:02:45.730> 3rd<00:02:46.000> string<00:02:46.030> and

00:02:46.650 --> 00:02:46.660 
string 2nd fret of the 3rd string and

00:02:46.660 --> 00:02:48.660 
string 2nd fret of the 3rd string and
you<00:02:47.050> can<00:02:47.200> do<00:02:47.680> that<00:02:47.830> with<00:02:48.100> these<00:02:48.280> two<00:02:48.520> fingers

00:02:48.660 --> 00:02:48.670 
you can do that with these two fingers

00:02:48.670 --> 00:02:50.730 
you can do that with these two fingers
your<00:02:49.030> middle<00:02:49.240> and<00:02:49.420> your<00:02:49.510> ring<00:02:49.810> so<00:02:50.440> you<00:02:50.470> can

00:02:50.730 --> 00:02:50.740 
your middle and your ring so you can

00:02:50.740 --> 00:02:55.510 
your middle and your ring so you can
just<00:02:51.040> put<00:02:51.190> it<00:02:51.250> like<00:02:51.280> that

00:02:55.510 --> 00:02:55.520 

00:02:55.520 --> 00:02:58.900 

but<00:02:56.030> if<00:02:56.440> also<00:02:57.440> this<00:02:57.980> this<00:02:58.550> is<00:02:58.700> kind<00:02:58.880> of

00:02:58.900 --> 00:02:58.910 
but if also this this is kind of

00:02:58.910 --> 00:03:01.960 
but if also this this is kind of
cheating<00:02:59.120> like<00:02:59.900> you<00:03:00.830> know<00:03:00.920> how<00:03:01.130> in<00:03:01.370> the<00:03:01.550> in<00:03:01.730> the

00:03:01.960 --> 00:03:01.970 
cheating like you know how in the in the

00:03:01.970 --> 00:03:04.930 
cheating like you know how in the in the
G<00:03:02.210> chord<00:03:02.510> in<00:03:02.870> does<00:03:03.140> ug<00:03:03.650> cheater<00:03:03.890> you<00:03:04.700> have<00:03:04.790> your

00:03:04.930 --> 00:03:04.940 
G chord in does ug cheater you have your

00:03:04.940 --> 00:03:08.200 
G chord in does ug cheater you have your
ring<00:03:05.450> finger<00:03:05.900> on<00:03:06.140> the<00:03:06.610> third<00:03:07.610> fret<00:03:07.640> of<00:03:08.150> the

00:03:08.200 --> 00:03:08.210 
ring finger on the third fret of the

00:03:08.210 --> 00:03:12.130 
ring finger on the third fret of the
second<00:03:09.140> string<00:03:09.170> you<00:03:09.980> have<00:03:10.880> it<00:03:11.060> right<00:03:11.180> here<00:03:11.450> and

00:03:12.130 --> 00:03:12.140 
second string you have it right here and

00:03:12.140 --> 00:03:14.560 
second string you have it right here and
then<00:03:12.890> you<00:03:12.980> can<00:03:13.070> switch<00:03:13.250> the<00:03:13.430> D<00:03:13.670> and<00:03:14.060> you<00:03:14.420> can

00:03:14.560 --> 00:03:14.570 
then you can switch the D and you can

00:03:14.570 --> 00:03:15.430 
then you can switch the D and you can
leave<00:03:14.720> it<00:03:14.870> right<00:03:14.900> there

00:03:15.430 --> 00:03:15.440 
leave it right there

00:03:15.440 --> 00:03:19.590 
leave it right there
well<00:03:16.220> with<00:03:16.580> the<00:03:16.760> e<00:03:16.940> you<00:03:17.660> the<00:03:18.110> a<00:03:18.260> minor<00:03:18.530> you<00:03:19.310> can

00:03:19.590 --> 00:03:19.600 
well with the e you the a minor you can

00:03:19.600 --> 00:03:24.580 
well with the e you the a minor you can
move<00:03:21.459> you<00:03:22.459> can<00:03:22.490> leave<00:03:22.850> this<00:03:23.000> finger<00:03:23.330> here<00:03:23.590> and

00:03:24.580 --> 00:03:24.590 
move you can leave this finger here and

00:03:24.590 --> 00:03:27.910 
move you can leave this finger here and
take<00:03:25.250> these<00:03:25.370> two<00:03:25.520> fingers<00:03:25.700> and<00:03:26.200> move<00:03:27.200> move

00:03:27.910 --> 00:03:27.920 
take these two fingers and move move

00:03:27.920 --> 00:03:29.650 
take these two fingers and move move
your<00:03:28.070> pointer<00:03:28.250> to<00:03:28.670> the<00:03:28.760> second<00:03:29.209> of<00:03:29.330> the<00:03:29.420> second

00:03:29.650 --> 00:03:29.660 
your pointer to the second of the second

00:03:29.660 --> 00:03:33.250 
your pointer to the second of the second
string<00:03:29.900> and<00:03:30.050> your<00:03:31.010> a<00:03:31.340> minnow<00:03:32.180> to<00:03:32.450> the<00:03:32.600> second

00:03:33.250 --> 00:03:33.260 
string and your a minnow to the second

00:03:33.260 --> 00:03:35.530 
string and your a minnow to the second
of<00:03:33.350> the<00:03:33.470> third<00:03:33.620> string<00:03:33.980> so<00:03:34.910> it's<00:03:35.060> not<00:03:35.150> like

00:03:35.530 --> 00:03:35.540 
of the third string so it's not like

00:03:35.540 --> 00:03:39.150 
of the third string so it's not like
that<00:03:35.750> just<00:03:36.430> this<00:03:37.430> is<00:03:37.640> on<00:03:37.790> the<00:03:37.880> second<00:03:38.209> and

00:03:39.150 --> 00:03:39.160 
that just this is on the second and

00:03:39.160 --> 00:03:41.770 
that just this is on the second and
middle<00:03:40.160> finger<00:03:40.340> on<00:03:40.459> the<00:03:40.489> second<00:03:40.820> of<00:03:41.090> the<00:03:41.570> third

00:03:41.770 --> 00:03:41.780 
middle finger on the second of the third

00:03:41.780 --> 00:03:43.750 
middle finger on the second of the third
and<00:03:42.380> then<00:03:42.500> you<00:03:42.709> can<00:03:42.860> leave<00:03:43.100> this<00:03:43.280> right<00:03:43.489> here

00:03:43.750 --> 00:03:43.760 
and then you can leave this right here

00:03:43.760 --> 00:03:46.390 
and then you can leave this right here
and<00:03:43.940> then<00:03:44.540> us<00:03:44.840> that's<00:03:45.650> that's<00:03:45.980> an<00:03:46.130> E<00:03:46.250> minor

00:03:46.390 --> 00:03:46.400 
and then us that's that's an E minor

00:03:46.400 --> 00:03:52.540 
and then us that's that's an E minor
seven<00:03:47.860> and<00:03:49.030> then<00:03:50.050> you<00:03:51.050> can<00:03:51.200> switch<00:03:51.380> C<00:03:52.250> is

00:03:52.540 --> 00:03:52.550 
seven and then you can switch C is

00:03:52.550 --> 00:03:54.850 
seven and then you can switch C is
pretty<00:03:52.880> much<00:03:53.000> the<00:03:53.180> same<00:03:53.420> thing<00:03:53.830> except<00:03:54.830> for

00:03:54.850 --> 00:03:54.860 
pretty much the same thing except for

00:03:54.860 --> 00:03:59.229 
pretty much the same thing except for
instead<00:03:55.790> of<00:03:56.180> this<00:03:56.420> and<00:03:57.320> so<00:03:57.590> this<00:03:57.940> the<00:03:58.940> second

00:03:59.229 --> 00:03:59.239 
instead of this and so this the second

00:03:59.239 --> 00:04:01.060 
instead of this and so this the second
fret<00:03:59.390> of<00:03:59.420> the<00:03:59.510> second<00:03:59.810> string<00:03:59.950> you're<00:04:00.950> going

00:04:01.060 --> 00:04:01.070 
fret of the second string you're going

00:04:01.070 --> 00:04:03.430 
fret of the second string you're going
to<00:04:01.130> want<00:04:01.310> to<00:04:01.340> do<00:04:01.459> the<00:04:01.580> third<00:04:02.239> the<00:04:02.959> third<00:04:03.170> fret

00:04:03.430 --> 00:04:03.440 
to want to do the third the third fret

00:04:03.440 --> 00:04:06.370 
to want to do the third the third fret
of<00:04:03.650> the<00:04:03.680> same<00:04:03.860> string<00:04:03.920> so<00:04:04.910> that<00:04:05.510> it's<00:04:05.989> actually

00:04:06.370 --> 00:04:06.380 
of the same string so that it's actually

00:04:06.380 --> 00:04:08.920 
of the same string so that it's actually
going<00:04:06.500> to<00:04:06.590> you<00:04:07.519> should<00:04:07.700> move<00:04:07.850> your<00:04:08.120> pointer

00:04:08.920 --> 00:04:08.930 
going to you should move your pointer

00:04:08.930 --> 00:04:10.539 
going to you should move your pointer
finger<00:04:09.350> to<00:04:09.650> where<00:04:09.799> your<00:04:09.950> middle<00:04:10.160> finger<00:04:10.519> is

00:04:10.539 --> 00:04:10.549 
finger to where your middle finger is

00:04:10.549 --> 00:04:12.699 
finger to where your middle finger is
and<00:04:11.360> then<00:04:11.540> move<00:04:11.660> your<00:04:11.690> middle<00:04:12.080> finger<00:04:12.380> to<00:04:12.620> the

00:04:12.699 --> 00:04:12.709 
and then move your middle finger to the

00:04:12.709 --> 00:04:15.070 
and then move your middle finger to the
third<00:04:13.010> for<00:04:13.790> the<00:04:13.850> second<00:04:14.269> string<00:04:14.510> so<00:04:14.900> that's

00:04:15.070 --> 00:04:15.080 
third for the second string so that's

00:04:15.080 --> 00:04:21.190 
third for the second string so that's
right<00:04:15.200> here<00:04:16.600> so<00:04:17.600> it's<00:04:17.780> got<00:04:17.959> its<00:04:19.510> GDU<00:04:20.510> minor<00:04:20.750> C

00:04:21.190 --> 00:04:21.200 
right here so it's got its GDU minor C

00:04:21.200 --> 00:04:24.880 
right here so it's got its GDU minor C
but<00:04:22.130> it's<00:04:22.640> cheater<00:04:23.060> so<00:04:23.560> pretty<00:04:24.560> much<00:04:24.680> you

00:04:24.880 --> 00:04:24.890 
but it's cheater so pretty much you

00:04:24.890 --> 00:04:26.890 
but it's cheater so pretty much you
don't<00:04:25.070> have<00:04:25.190> to<00:04:25.280> move<00:04:25.430> this<00:04:25.550> finger<00:04:25.729> at<00:04:25.970> all<00:04:26.150> so

00:04:26.890 --> 00:04:26.900 
don't have to move this finger at all so

00:04:26.900 --> 00:04:29.560 
don't have to move this finger at all so
like<00:04:27.710> when<00:04:27.890> you<00:04:28.010> start<00:04:28.310> it's<00:04:29.030> it's<00:04:29.330> on<00:04:29.479> the

00:04:29.560 --> 00:04:29.570 
like when you start it's it's on the

00:04:29.570 --> 00:04:34.150 
like when you start it's it's on the
third<00:04:30.040> of<00:04:31.040> the<00:04:31.250> second<00:04:31.460> of<00:04:31.550> the<00:04:31.640> last<00:04:32.680> but<00:04:33.680> so

00:04:34.150 --> 00:04:34.160 
third of the second of the last but so

00:04:34.160 --> 00:04:36.010 
third of the second of the last but so
that's<00:04:34.310> going<00:04:34.490> to<00:04:34.550> hurt<00:04:34.729> sometimes<00:04:35.060> and<00:04:35.570> you

00:04:36.010 --> 00:04:36.020 
that's going to hurt sometimes and you

00:04:36.020 --> 00:04:37.630 
that's going to hurt sometimes and you
really<00:04:36.740> don't<00:04:36.830> need<00:04:37.010> to<00:04:37.070> move<00:04:37.220> your<00:04:37.430> pinky
