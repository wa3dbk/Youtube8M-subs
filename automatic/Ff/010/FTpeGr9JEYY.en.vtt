00:00:15.340 --> 00:00:18.279 

I'm<00:00:16.340> interested<00:00:16.670> in<00:00:16.939> how<00:00:17.119> changing<00:00:17.720> air<00:00:18.050> and

00:00:18.279 --> 00:00:18.289 
I'm interested in how changing air and

00:00:18.289 --> 00:00:20.019 
I'm interested in how changing air and
ocean<00:00:18.590> temperatures<00:00:19.070> will<00:00:19.369> affect<00:00:19.730> marine

00:00:20.019 --> 00:00:20.029 
ocean temperatures will affect marine

00:00:20.029 --> 00:00:22.179 
ocean temperatures will affect marine
life<00:00:20.300> along<00:00:20.660> the<00:00:20.810> California<00:00:20.990> coast<00:00:21.619> and<00:00:21.919> so

00:00:22.179 --> 00:00:22.189 
life along the California coast and so

00:00:22.189 --> 00:00:24.190 
life along the California coast and so
we've<00:00:22.340> been<00:00:22.490> working<00:00:22.700> on<00:00:23.119> the<00:00:23.330> ochre<00:00:23.689> sea<00:00:23.900> star

00:00:24.190 --> 00:00:24.200 
we've been working on the ochre sea star

00:00:24.200 --> 00:00:26.140 
we've been working on the ochre sea star
with<00:00:24.439> it's<00:00:24.619> been<00:00:24.770> called<00:00:25.009> a<00:00:25.189> keystone<00:00:25.520> species

00:00:26.140 --> 00:00:26.150 
with it's been called a keystone species

00:00:26.150 --> 00:00:28.900 
with it's been called a keystone species
because<00:00:26.779> its<00:00:26.960> effect<00:00:27.289> is<00:00:27.470> is<00:00:27.890> so<00:00:28.160> important<00:00:28.730> in

00:00:28.900 --> 00:00:28.910 
because its effect is is so important in

00:00:28.910 --> 00:00:31.570 
because its effect is is so important in
these<00:00:29.060> marine<00:00:29.420> ecosystems<00:00:30.080> so<00:00:30.980> the<00:00:31.160> ochre<00:00:31.400> sea

00:00:31.570 --> 00:00:31.580 
these marine ecosystems so the ochre sea

00:00:31.580 --> 00:00:33.460 
these marine ecosystems so the ochre sea
star<00:00:31.820> feeds<00:00:32.090> on<00:00:32.239> muscles<00:00:32.720> and<00:00:32.989> muscles<00:00:33.350> are

00:00:33.460 --> 00:00:33.470 
star feeds on muscles and muscles are

00:00:33.470 --> 00:00:35.130 
star feeds on muscles and muscles are
important<00:00:33.920> for<00:00:34.100> a<00:00:34.129> variety<00:00:34.370> of<00:00:34.640> reasons

00:00:35.130 --> 00:00:35.140 
important for a variety of reasons

00:00:35.140 --> 00:00:37.720 
important for a variety of reasons
mussels<00:00:36.140> are<00:00:36.260> the<00:00:36.350> dominant<00:00:36.769> competitors<00:00:37.370> for

00:00:37.720 --> 00:00:37.730 
mussels are the dominant competitors for

00:00:37.730 --> 00:00:40.540 
mussels are the dominant competitors for
space<00:00:38.000> on<00:00:38.300> rocky<00:00:38.540> shores<00:00:38.930> and<00:00:39.230> mussels<00:00:40.190> form

00:00:40.540 --> 00:00:40.550 
space on rocky shores and mussels form

00:00:40.550 --> 00:00:42.789 
space on rocky shores and mussels form
beds<00:00:41.089> that<00:00:41.449> provide<00:00:41.750> habitat<00:00:42.350> for<00:00:42.620> a<00:00:42.680> variety

00:00:42.789 --> 00:00:42.799 
beds that provide habitat for a variety

00:00:42.799 --> 00:00:44.890 
beds that provide habitat for a variety
of<00:00:43.190> different<00:00:43.580> species<00:00:43.820> what<00:00:44.390> we<00:00:44.510> found<00:00:44.750> is

00:00:44.890 --> 00:00:44.900 
of different species what we found is

00:00:44.900 --> 00:00:46.180 
of different species what we found is
that<00:00:44.930> the<00:00:45.170> sea<00:00:45.320> stars<00:00:45.559> are<00:00:45.650> actually<00:00:45.920> really

00:00:46.180 --> 00:00:46.190 
that the sea stars are actually really

00:00:46.190 --> 00:00:47.799 
that the sea stars are actually really
sensitive<00:00:46.460> to<00:00:47.089> small<00:00:47.360> changes<00:00:47.600> in

00:00:47.799 --> 00:00:47.809 
sensitive to small changes in

00:00:47.809 --> 00:00:49.960 
sensitive to small changes in
temperatures<00:00:48.350> so<00:00:48.739> if<00:00:49.220> the<00:00:49.460> sea<00:00:49.640> star<00:00:49.850> has

00:00:49.960 --> 00:00:49.970 
temperatures so if the sea star has

00:00:49.970 --> 00:00:52.180 
temperatures so if the sea star has
experienced<00:00:50.600> these<00:00:50.780> moderately<00:00:51.650> warm<00:00:51.979> low

00:00:52.180 --> 00:00:52.190 
experienced these moderately warm low

00:00:52.190 --> 00:00:53.979 
experienced these moderately warm low
tides<00:00:52.489> they<00:00:52.790> get<00:00:52.940> really<00:00:53.210> stressed<00:00:53.510> out<00:00:53.629> and

00:00:53.979 --> 00:00:53.989 
tides they get really stressed out and

00:00:53.989 --> 00:00:56.920 
tides they get really stressed out and
they<00:00:54.199> consume<00:00:54.890> fewer<00:00:55.250> mussels<00:00:55.699> and<00:00:55.940> end<00:00:56.780> up

00:00:56.920 --> 00:00:56.930 
they consume fewer mussels and end up

00:00:56.930 --> 00:00:59.229 
they consume fewer mussels and end up
growing<00:00:57.140> a<00:00:57.379> lot<00:00:57.530> less<00:00:57.769> you<00:00:58.519> can<00:00:58.729> see<00:00:58.940> a<00:00:58.970> sea

00:00:59.229 --> 00:00:59.239 
growing a lot less you can see a sea

00:00:59.239 --> 00:01:00.640 
growing a lot less you can see a sea
star<00:00:59.449> that's<00:00:59.690> feeding<00:00:59.900> on<00:01:00.170> a<00:01:00.199> clump<00:01:00.530> of

00:01:00.640 --> 00:01:00.650 
star that's feeding on a clump of

00:01:00.650 --> 00:01:03.130 
star that's feeding on a clump of
mussels<00:01:01.070> and<00:01:01.879> in<00:01:02.030> particular<00:01:02.510> this<00:01:02.750> one<00:01:02.809> that

00:01:03.130 --> 00:01:03.140 
mussels and in particular this one that

00:01:03.140 --> 00:01:05.170 
mussels and in particular this one that
it's<00:01:03.290> holding<00:01:03.530> is<00:01:04.339> the<00:01:04.400> one<00:01:04.670> that<00:01:04.760> it's<00:01:04.879> eating

00:01:05.170 --> 00:01:05.180 
it's holding is the one that it's eating

00:01:05.180 --> 00:01:07.719 
it's holding is the one that it's eating
right<00:01:05.360> now<00:01:05.540> and<00:01:06.290> you<00:01:06.590> can<00:01:06.740> see<00:01:06.950> how<00:01:07.189> it's<00:01:07.369> using

00:01:07.719 --> 00:01:07.729 
right now and you can see how it's using

00:01:07.729 --> 00:01:09.760 
right now and you can see how it's using
its<00:01:07.820> tube<00:01:08.119> feet<00:01:08.390> to<00:01:08.600> pull<00:01:08.840> on<00:01:09.020> either<00:01:09.260> side<00:01:09.619> of

00:01:09.760 --> 00:01:09.770 
its tube feet to pull on either side of

00:01:09.770 --> 00:01:12.219 
its tube feet to pull on either side of
the<00:01:09.860> shell<00:01:10.130> so<00:01:10.369> most<00:01:11.299> climate<00:01:11.689> change<00:01:11.900> studies

00:01:12.219 --> 00:01:12.229 
the shell so most climate change studies

00:01:12.229 --> 00:01:13.750 
the shell so most climate change studies
have<00:01:12.439> tended<00:01:12.770> to<00:01:12.799> focus<00:01:13.010> on<00:01:13.369> direct

00:01:13.750 --> 00:01:13.760 
have tended to focus on direct

00:01:13.760 --> 00:01:16.270 
have tended to focus on direct
interactions<00:01:14.450> on<00:01:14.659> a<00:01:14.689> single<00:01:15.200> species<00:01:15.439> but<00:01:16.159> we

00:01:16.270 --> 00:01:16.280 
interactions on a single species but we

00:01:16.280 --> 00:01:17.950 
interactions on a single species but we
have<00:01:16.429> to<00:01:16.549> remember<00:01:16.789> also<00:01:16.969> that<00:01:17.450> species<00:01:17.750> are

00:01:17.950 --> 00:01:17.960 
have to remember also that species are

00:01:17.960 --> 00:01:19.569 
have to remember also that species are
embedded<00:01:18.560> in<00:01:18.679> communities<00:01:19.219> and<00:01:19.490> they

00:01:19.569 --> 00:01:19.579 
embedded in communities and they

00:01:19.579 --> 00:01:21.370 
embedded in communities and they
interact<00:01:20.149> with<00:01:20.270> dozens<00:01:20.719> of<00:01:20.840> other<00:01:21.020> species

00:01:21.370 --> 00:01:21.380 
interact with dozens of other species

00:01:21.380 --> 00:01:23.830 
interact with dozens of other species
here<00:01:22.310> at<00:01:22.670> the<00:01:22.789> bodega<00:01:23.090> Marine<00:01:23.240> Lab<00:01:23.479> we<00:01:23.719> were

00:01:23.830 --> 00:01:23.840 
here at the bodega Marine Lab we were

00:01:23.840 --> 00:01:25.120 
here at the bodega Marine Lab we were
interested<00:01:24.140> in<00:01:24.350> how<00:01:24.409> warming<00:01:24.979> air

00:01:25.120 --> 00:01:25.130 
interested in how warming air

00:01:25.130 --> 00:01:27.069 
interested in how warming air
temperatures<00:01:25.729> might<00:01:26.090> affect<00:01:26.479> these<00:01:26.869> sea

00:01:27.069 --> 00:01:27.079 
temperatures might affect these sea

00:01:27.079 --> 00:01:28.810 
temperatures might affect these sea
stars<00:01:27.380> and<00:01:27.619> so<00:01:27.979> in<00:01:28.130> these<00:01:28.249> laboratory

00:01:28.810 --> 00:01:28.820 
stars and so in these laboratory

00:01:28.820 --> 00:01:30.639 
stars and so in these laboratory
experiments<00:01:29.450> we<00:01:29.630> hold<00:01:29.899> the<00:01:30.020> sea<00:01:30.200> stars<00:01:30.439> in

00:01:30.639 --> 00:01:30.649 
experiments we hold the sea stars in

00:01:30.649 --> 00:01:34.569 
experiments we hold the sea stars in
tanks<00:01:31.039> under<00:01:31.549> simulated<00:01:32.140> tidal<00:01:33.140> schedules<00:01:33.619> so

00:01:34.569 --> 00:01:34.579 
tanks under simulated tidal schedules so

00:01:34.579 --> 00:01:36.550 
tanks under simulated tidal schedules so
now<00:01:35.179> that<00:01:35.240> it's<00:01:35.479> low<00:01:35.659> tide<00:01:35.929> we're<00:01:36.289> going<00:01:36.469> to

00:01:36.550 --> 00:01:36.560 
now that it's low tide we're going to

00:01:36.560 --> 00:01:39.279 
now that it's low tide we're going to
turn<00:01:36.799> on<00:01:37.009> these<00:01:37.429> ceramic<00:01:38.299> heaters<00:01:38.689> that<00:01:39.140> are

00:01:39.279 --> 00:01:39.289 
turn on these ceramic heaters that are

00:01:39.289 --> 00:01:42.370 
turn on these ceramic heaters that are
above<00:01:39.530> the<00:01:39.740> tanks<00:01:40.159> and<00:01:40.700> by<00:01:41.329> raising<00:01:42.140> or

00:01:42.370 --> 00:01:42.380 
above the tanks and by raising or

00:01:42.380 --> 00:01:45.669 
above the tanks and by raising or
lowering<00:01:42.409> these<00:01:43.280> ceramic<00:01:44.090> heaters<00:01:44.450> we<00:01:45.380> change

00:01:45.669 --> 00:01:45.679 
lowering these ceramic heaters we change

00:01:45.679 --> 00:01:47.289 
lowering these ceramic heaters we change
the<00:01:45.859> distance<00:01:46.009> between<00:01:46.369> the<00:01:46.729> heaters<00:01:47.030> and<00:01:47.060> the

00:01:47.289 --> 00:01:47.299 
the distance between the heaters and the

00:01:47.299 --> 00:01:49.959 
the distance between the heaters and the
sea<00:01:47.479> stars<00:01:47.719> and<00:01:48.109> therefore<00:01:48.649> we<00:01:48.829> change<00:01:49.310> their

00:01:49.959 --> 00:01:49.969 
sea stars and therefore we change their

00:01:49.969 --> 00:01:52.239 
sea stars and therefore we change their
body<00:01:50.210> temperatures<00:01:50.749> so<00:01:50.780> our<00:01:51.499> results<00:01:51.920> suggest

00:01:52.239 --> 00:01:52.249 
body temperatures so our results suggest

00:01:52.249 --> 00:01:54.940 
body temperatures so our results suggest
that<00:01:52.369> if<00:01:52.869> during<00:01:53.869> the<00:01:54.020> summertime<00:01:54.350> there<00:01:54.829> are

00:01:54.940 --> 00:01:54.950 
that if during the summertime there are

00:01:54.950 --> 00:01:56.469 
that if during the summertime there are
more<00:01:55.130> warm<00:01:55.460> events<00:01:55.909> which<00:01:56.119> is<00:01:56.299> what's

00:01:56.469 --> 00:01:56.479 
more warm events which is what's

00:01:56.479 --> 00:01:58.389 
more warm events which is what's
predicted<00:01:56.990> by<00:01:57.109> climate<00:01:57.560> models<00:01:57.889> to<00:01:57.979> occur

00:01:58.389 --> 00:01:58.399 
predicted by climate models to occur

00:01:58.399 --> 00:02:00.340 
predicted by climate models to occur
along<00:01:58.639> the<00:01:58.700> California<00:01:58.999> coast<00:01:59.600> then<00:02:00.200> this

00:02:00.340 --> 00:02:00.350 
along the California coast then this

00:02:00.350 --> 00:02:01.899 
along the California coast then this
could<00:02:00.439> have<00:02:00.619> a<00:02:00.649> really<00:02:00.829> big<00:02:01.100> effect<00:02:01.249> on<00:02:01.670> these

00:02:01.899 --> 00:02:01.909 
could have a really big effect on these

00:02:01.909 --> 00:02:04.270 
could have a really big effect on these
marine<00:02:02.299> ecosystems<00:02:02.990> so<00:02:03.469> through<00:02:03.799> its<00:02:03.950> effects

00:02:04.270 --> 00:02:04.280 
marine ecosystems so through its effects

00:02:04.280 --> 00:02:06.429 
marine ecosystems so through its effects
on<00:02:04.490> these<00:02:04.609> mussels<00:02:05.060> this<00:02:05.479> sea<00:02:05.689> star<00:02:05.719> can<00:02:06.259> play

00:02:06.429 --> 00:02:06.439 
on these mussels this sea star can play

00:02:06.439 --> 00:02:08.590 
on these mussels this sea star can play
a<00:02:06.469> keystone<00:02:06.950> role<00:02:07.249> because<00:02:07.999> it<00:02:08.240> can<00:02:08.390> change

00:02:08.590 --> 00:02:08.600 
a keystone role because it can change

00:02:08.600 --> 00:02:10.930 
a keystone role because it can change
the<00:02:08.869> way<00:02:08.990> the<00:02:09.229> whole<00:02:09.259> rocky<00:02:09.800> ecosystem<00:02:10.550> looks

00:02:10.930 --> 00:02:10.940 
the way the whole rocky ecosystem looks

00:02:10.940 --> 00:02:13.240 
the way the whole rocky ecosystem looks
and<00:02:11.360> how<00:02:11.480> it<00:02:11.600> functions<00:02:12.069> through<00:02:13.069> its

00:02:13.240 --> 00:02:13.250 
and how it functions through its

00:02:13.250 --> 00:02:15.250 
and how it functions through its
predation<00:02:13.790> on<00:02:13.910> these<00:02:14.120> these<00:02:14.450> mussels<00:02:14.930> and

00:02:15.250 --> 00:02:15.260 
predation on these these mussels and

00:02:15.260 --> 00:02:16.510 
predation on these these mussels and
because<00:02:15.590> the<00:02:15.770> mussels<00:02:16.100> are<00:02:16.190> such<00:02:16.370> an

00:02:16.510 --> 00:02:16.520 
because the mussels are such an

00:02:16.520 --> 00:02:18.220 
because the mussels are such an
important<00:02:16.940> part<00:02:17.090> of<00:02:17.180> this<00:02:17.270> community<00:02:17.480> it

00:02:18.220 --> 00:02:18.230 
important part of this community it

00:02:18.230 --> 00:02:20.170 
important part of this community it
could<00:02:18.410> actually<00:02:18.590> change<00:02:19.040> the<00:02:19.310> composition<00:02:19.550> of

00:02:20.170 --> 00:02:20.180 
could actually change the composition of

00:02:20.180 --> 00:02:22.690 
could actually change the composition of
