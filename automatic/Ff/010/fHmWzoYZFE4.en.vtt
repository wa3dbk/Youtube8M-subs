00:00:03.760 --> 00:00:07.510
 not bad 

00:00:09.460 --> 00:00:14.000
 very good to all kids to kid and 

00:00:12.320 --> 00:00:16.099
 commenting here we are in another video 

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:17.840
 more after a long time so 

00:00:16.099 --> 00:00:19.970
 I could not upload videos that you already know 

00:00:17.840 --> 00:00:21.529
 problems that I have had so much that I 

00:00:19.970 --> 00:00:23.510
 has broken the computer like helmets 

00:00:21.529 --> 00:00:25.070
 etcetera but good and I 've bought a 

00:00:23.510 --> 00:00:26.180
 computer to pieces that is the truth is 

00:00:25.070 --> 00:00:28.070
 that is going very cucumber that is going to 

00:00:26.180 --> 00:00:30.380
 facilitate very much and then for another 

00:00:28.070 --> 00:00:32.150
 side I bought the stars at 50 that 

00:00:30.380 --> 00:00:34.640
 that will also greatly improve the 

00:00:32.150 --> 00:00:36.620
 audio quality for the channel and good 

00:00:34.640 --> 00:00:38.930
 Well, we're here with a new 

00:00:36.620 --> 00:00:40.640
 episode of the elite school is this 

00:00:38.930 --> 00:00:42.530
 episode we play the h 20 

00:00:40.640 --> 00:00:43.580
 and that in fact I have 2 h for insanity 

00:00:42.530 --> 00:00:47.059
 that the truth is that it is a great bitch 

00:00:43.580 --> 00:00:49.850
 but it's good to say that 

00:00:47.059 --> 00:00:51.530
 I have series designed in the good now 

00:00:49.850 --> 00:00:54.019
 same I am there thinking gave me some 

00:00:51.530 --> 00:00:56.000
 how many series one of them is linked 

00:00:54.019 --> 00:00:58.729
 with the theme of has two insanity and already 

00:00:56.000 --> 00:01:00.949
 I will tell you and well then others good and 

00:00:58.729 --> 00:01:02.299
 tell you what the special milk asks 

00:01:00.949 --> 00:01:04.909
 is around the corner so 

00:01:02.299 --> 00:01:07.310
 well I have thought about doing a setup to 

00:01:04.909 --> 00:01:09.500
 of a setup of my game zone so 

00:01:07.310 --> 00:01:11.170
 well, if this video is good 

00:01:09.500 --> 00:01:13.409
 received if we have inder likes 

00:01:11.170 --> 00:01:16.479
 that will mean that you want me to do the 

00:01:13.409 --> 00:01:19.090
 special milk the setup in this case so 

00:01:16.479 --> 00:01:20.320
 that good without more we go with the video and 

00:01:19.090 --> 00:01:22.990
 well let's go there with the first 

00:01:20.320 --> 00:01:24.939
 template to start as a model is the 

00:01:22.990 --> 00:01:26.530
 insanity for many is to improve the game 

00:01:24.939 --> 00:01:28.930
 I do not have anything to say because the 

00:01:26.530 --> 00:01:30.610
 it's true that I think the same so good 

00:01:28.930 --> 00:01:33.070
 let's go with the rarity of royalty is the 

00:01:30.610 --> 00:01:35.680
 elite obviously although good then there's 

00:01:33.070 --> 00:01:37.210
 exceptions like the goal to be good 

00:01:35.680 --> 00:01:39.970
 you all know what is professional and is 

00:01:37.210 --> 00:01:43.119
 for many also the improvement left me and 

00:01:39.970 --> 00:01:45.850
 well this weapon adds more damage to one and 

00:01:43.119 --> 00:01:48.159
 cadence plus 2 and only remains handling 

00:01:45.850 --> 00:01:49.509
 plus 12 unless one sorry I think that 

00:01:48.159 --> 00:01:51.819
 This is the best half-game 

00:01:49.509 --> 00:01:54.369
 because it gives you a lot and you get 

00:01:51.819 --> 00:01:55.869
 I think that I handle who 

00:01:54.369 --> 00:01:58.330
 more is not in that 1 that minus one of 

00:01:55.869 --> 00:02:00.190
 handling and on the other hand the plus one of 

00:01:58.330 --> 00:02:03.310
 damage and especially the two plus deficiency 

00:02:00.190 --> 00:02:05.440
 it was from this weapon that it was a cucumber but 

00:02:03.310 --> 00:02:06.250
 well let's move on to the next 

00:02:05.440 --> 00:02:07.899
 template 

00:02:06.250 --> 00:02:09.459
 ok kids we are here with the 

00:02:07.899 --> 00:02:14.380
 next template we start with the 

00:02:09.459 --> 00:02:17.210
 damage has 40 33 and 25 I explain what 

00:02:14.380 --> 00:02:19.340
 you want to say what does this mean 

00:02:17.210 --> 00:02:21.890
 short distance kill the dehesa 

00:02:19.340 --> 00:02:25.310
 has a damage of 40 that is three 

00:02:21.890 --> 00:02:27.290
 bullets we will kill him distance me 

00:02:25.310 --> 00:02:29.750
 33 means that good as each to 

00:02:27.290 --> 00:02:31.250
 each bullet is 32 damage to average 

00:02:29.750 --> 00:02:33.890
 distance so we'll kill him from other 

00:02:31.250 --> 00:02:36.560
 three bullets and long distance has 

00:02:33.890 --> 00:02:38.330
 damage 25 that means that no longer 

00:02:36.560 --> 00:02:40.220
 we can kill him with three bullets but 

00:02:38.330 --> 00:02:41.810
 four with this also explained to the 

00:02:40.220 --> 00:02:43.880
 reach so well then two in one 

00:02:41.810 --> 00:02:46.310
 as cadence this weapon starts 

00:02:43.880 --> 00:02:48.860
 firing a cadenza of a thousand bullets by 

00:02:46.310 --> 00:02:51.200
 minute and then it goes down to 

00:02:48.860 --> 00:02:53.300
 750 bullets per minute the truth is that it is 

00:02:51.200 --> 00:02:54.280
 one pass compared with the cadence that 

00:02:53.300 --> 00:02:57.680
 he has the normal weapon 

00:02:54.280 --> 00:03:00.410
 The normal model of the chivera 3 is 

00:02:57.680 --> 00:03:02.360
 impressive how the cadence goes up and 

00:03:00.410 --> 00:03:04.100
 this makes the weapon so good and 

00:03:02.360 --> 00:03:07.400
 well we go to the third and last 

00:03:04.100 --> 00:03:10.189
 template of this elite school 

00:03:07.400 --> 00:03:13.340
 in this case as a charger we have 30 

00:03:10.189 --> 00:03:15.049
 base bullets and 45 if we put the 

00:03:13.340 --> 00:03:18.349
 charger has expanded 

00:03:15.049 --> 00:03:20.329
 this is a lava that is the same with the 

00:03:18.349 --> 00:03:21.950
 normal model of the basic model of this 

00:03:20.329 --> 00:03:23.540
 Weapon because this model does not come up 

00:03:21.950 --> 00:03:26.030
 charger in some cases in some 

00:03:23.540 --> 00:03:27.980
 weapons that lowers you or in some you 

00:03:26.030 --> 00:03:30.109
 it comes out in some cases it goes up and in 

00:03:27.980 --> 00:03:32.390
 some others low as you know the 

00:03:30.109 --> 00:03:34.430
 famous here 12 ripke lowers the loader 

00:03:32.390 --> 00:03:37.849
 I'll bring it to the 

00:03:34.430 --> 00:03:39.950
 channel as ammunition this weapon has 90 

00:03:37.849 --> 00:03:42.980
 bullets in the bedroom and if we put the 

00:03:39.950 --> 00:03:46.190
 Extended charger has 135 

00:03:42.980 --> 00:03:49.310
 Recharge takes 15 seconds 

00:03:46.190 --> 00:03:51.319
 if we do a normal recharge and 13 and you 

00:03:49.310 --> 00:03:53.269
 we give to recharge twice already you know 

00:03:51.319 --> 00:03:56.569
 that discards the bullets that it has in the 

00:03:53.269 --> 00:03:59.569
 bedroom that makes good because it 

00:03:56.569 --> 00:04:00.830
 wear before the bullets good demands 

00:03:59.569 --> 00:04:03.319
 you have to have before the bullets 

00:04:00.830 --> 00:04:05.629
 what you have but good on the other hand are 

00:04:03.319 --> 00:04:07.849
 0 with 20 seconds that makes that good 

00:04:05.629 --> 00:04:11.720
 Well, in some situations, it's better 

00:04:07.849 --> 00:04:15.230
 that already depends on the situation you are 

00:04:11.720 --> 00:04:18.290
 recharge when it is empty and it takes 2 with 

00:04:15.230 --> 00:04:20.810
 a second is worth it because this is when 

00:04:18.290 --> 00:04:22.850
 you have zero bullets in the chamber and you have 

00:04:20.810 --> 00:04:25.250
 and he has to put the bolt that makes 

00:04:22.850 --> 00:04:27.470
 that it takes a lot more and good kids 

00:04:25.250 --> 00:04:29.600
 well this has been in the elite school of 

00:04:27.470 --> 00:04:31.520
