however my great plans failed miserably

00:00:16.710 --> 00:00:19.510 
however my great plans failed miserably
because<00:00:17.250> I<00:00:18.150> up<00:00:18.330> and<00:00:18.660> had<00:00:18.869> a<00:00:18.900> crash

because I up and had a crash

00:00:19.520 --> 00:00:22.840 
because I up and had a crash
where<00:00:20.520> I<00:00:20.779> fell<00:00:21.779> over<00:00:21.810> the<00:00:22.260> handlebars

00:00:22.840 --> 00:00:22.850 
where I fell over the handlebars

00:00:22.850 --> 00:00:24.439 
where I fell over the handlebars
dislocated<00:00:23.850> my<00:00:23.880> shoulder

00:00:24.439 --> 00:00:24.449 
dislocated my shoulder

00:00:24.449 --> 00:00:26.689 
dislocated my shoulder
however<00:00:25.380> the<00:00:25.859> first<00:00:26.039> point<00:00:26.430> that<00:00:26.519> I'm<00:00:26.670> going

00:00:26.689 --> 00:00:26.699 
however the first point that I'm going

00:00:26.699 --> 00:00:29.450 
however the first point that I'm going
to<00:00:26.970> make<00:00:27.090> this<00:00:27.359> bike<00:00:27.599> is<00:00:27.980> the<00:00:28.980> bike<00:00:29.220> was

00:00:29.450 --> 00:00:29.460 
to make this bike is the bike was

00:00:29.460 --> 00:00:31.550 
to make this bike is the bike was
perfectly<00:00:29.970> fine<00:00:30.090> after<00:00:30.660> the<00:00:30.810> crash<00:00:31.050> apart

00:00:31.550 --> 00:00:31.560 
perfectly fine after the crash apart

00:00:31.560 --> 00:00:34.100 
perfectly fine after the crash apart
from<00:00:31.830> some<00:00:32.640> minor<00:00:32.969> scratches<00:00:33.480> and<00:00:34.050> the

00:00:34.100 --> 00:00:34.110 
from some minor scratches and the

00:00:34.110 --> 00:00:36.860 
from some minor scratches and the
slightly<00:00:34.770> twisted<00:00:35.340> handlebar<00:00:35.880> but<00:00:36.660> that

00:00:36.860 --> 00:00:36.870 
slightly twisted handlebar but that

00:00:36.870 --> 00:00:39.819 
slightly twisted handlebar but that
could<00:00:37.140> all<00:00:37.260> be<00:00:37.290> either<00:00:37.980> fixed<00:00:38.340> or<00:00:38.610> ignored

00:00:39.819 --> 00:00:39.829 
could all be either fixed or ignored

00:00:39.829 --> 00:00:42.380 
could all be either fixed or ignored
yeah<00:00:40.829> so<00:00:41.040> the<00:00:41.160> bike<00:00:41.340> is<00:00:41.489> quite<00:00:41.700> a<00:00:41.730> bit<00:00:41.910> stronger

00:00:42.380 --> 00:00:42.390 
yeah so the bike is quite a bit stronger

00:00:42.390 --> 00:00:43.010 
yeah so the bike is quite a bit stronger
than<00:00:42.629> I<00:00:42.750> am

00:00:43.010 --> 00:00:43.020 
than I am

00:00:43.020 --> 00:00:47.119 
than I am
in<00:00:43.890> terms<00:00:44.160> of<00:00:44.340> durability<00:00:45.180> and<00:00:45.620> resistance<00:00:46.620> to

00:00:47.119 --> 00:00:47.129 
in terms of durability and resistance to

00:00:47.129 --> 00:00:51.590 
in terms of durability and resistance to
 up<00:00:48.320> so<00:00:49.320> yeah<00:00:50.149> currently<00:00:51.149> I've<00:00:51.300> done

00:00:51.590 --> 00:00:51.600 
 up so yeah currently I've done

00:00:51.600 --> 00:00:56.240 
 up so yeah currently I've done
about<00:00:52.789> 150<00:00:53.789> kilometers<00:00:54.390> on<00:00:54.600> it<00:00:55.070> the<00:00:56.070> reason

00:00:56.240 --> 00:00:56.250 
about 150 kilometers on it the reason

00:00:56.250 --> 00:00:58.430 
about 150 kilometers on it the reason
for<00:00:56.550> it<00:00:56.670> being<00:00:56.879> the<00:00:57.449> dislocated<00:00:57.989> shoulder

00:00:58.430 --> 00:00:58.440 
for it being the dislocated shoulder

00:00:58.440 --> 00:00:59.720 
for it being the dislocated shoulder
which<00:00:58.620> caused<00:00:58.829> me<00:00:59.010> three<00:00:59.309> weeks<00:00:59.550> of

00:00:59.720 --> 00:00:59.730 
which caused me three weeks of

00:01:27.980 --> 00:01:27.990 
are well they're quite okay apart from

00:01:27.990 --> 00:01:30.440 
are well they're quite okay apart from
them<00:01:28.259> having<00:01:28.710> only<00:01:29.280> three<00:01:29.430> Center<00:01:30.030> settings

00:01:30.440 --> 00:01:30.450 
them having only three Center settings

00:01:30.450 --> 00:01:35.830 
them having only three Center settings
off<00:01:31.850> slightly<00:01:32.850> on<00:01:33.240> and<00:01:33.600> locked<00:01:34.320> out<00:01:34.470> wheels<00:01:34.829> I

00:01:35.830 --> 00:01:35.840 
off slightly on and locked out wheels I

00:01:35.840 --> 00:01:38.300 
off slightly on and locked out wheels I
really<00:01:36.840> would<00:01:37.020> appreciate<00:01:37.140> some<00:01:37.560> breaks<00:01:37.979> with

00:01:38.300 --> 00:01:38.310 
really would appreciate some breaks with

00:01:38.310 --> 00:01:43.999 
really would appreciate some breaks with
a<00:01:38.720> tiny<00:01:39.720> bit<00:01:40.200> more<00:01:40.229> like<00:01:41.390> heel<00:01:42.390> to<00:01:42.899> them<00:01:43.110> but

00:01:43.999 --> 00:01:44.009 
a tiny bit more like heel to them but

00:01:44.009 --> 00:01:46.730 
a tiny bit more like heel to them but
well<00:01:44.250> for<00:01:44.549> now<00:01:44.729> they're<00:01:45.000> good<00:01:45.479> enough<00:01:45.810> at<00:01:46.680> a

00:01:46.730 --> 00:01:46.740 
well for now they're good enough at a

00:01:46.740 --> 00:01:49.310 
well for now they're good enough at a
later<00:01:47.009> point<00:01:47.340> I<00:01:47.549> will<00:01:47.759> try<00:01:48.180> to<00:01:48.210> maybe<00:01:49.079> upgrade

00:01:49.310 --> 00:01:49.320 
later point I will try to maybe upgrade

00:01:49.320 --> 00:01:51.830 
later point I will try to maybe upgrade
them<00:01:49.880> another<00:01:50.880> thing<00:01:51.090> with<00:01:51.270> the<00:01:51.299> brakes<00:01:51.630> is

00:01:51.830 --> 00:01:51.840 
them another thing with the brakes is

00:01:51.840 --> 00:01:54.560 
them another thing with the brakes is
that<00:01:51.960> I<00:01:51.990> notice<00:01:52.439> that<00:01:53.000> you<00:01:54.000> can<00:01:54.149> adjust<00:01:54.450> the

00:01:54.560 --> 00:01:54.570 
that I notice that you can adjust the

00:01:54.570 --> 00:01:56.510 
that I notice that you can adjust the
reach<00:01:54.750> on<00:01:54.990> them<00:01:55.200> but<00:01:55.350> you<00:01:55.409> can't<00:01:55.710> adjust<00:01:55.829> like

00:01:56.510 --> 00:01:56.520 
reach on them but you can't adjust like

00:01:56.520 --> 00:02:01.999 
reach on them but you can't adjust like
where<00:01:57.030> exactly<00:01:57.450> do<00:01:57.899> they<00:01:58.140> like<00:01:59.060> volkov<00:02:01.009> well

00:02:01.999 --> 00:02:02.009 
where exactly do they like volkov well

00:02:02.009 --> 00:02:03.770 
where exactly do they like volkov well
you<00:02:02.280> know<00:02:02.430> whatever<00:02:02.640> I<00:02:02.939> mean<00:02:03.180> there's<00:02:03.479> tiny

00:02:03.770 --> 00:02:03.780 
you know whatever I mean there's tiny

00:02:03.780 --> 00:02:06.469 
you know whatever I mean there's tiny
screw<00:02:04.140> usually<00:02:04.530> somewhere<00:02:04.890> here<00:02:05.399> that<00:02:06.119> would

00:02:06.469 --> 00:02:06.479 
screw usually somewhere here that would

00:02:06.479 --> 00:02:08.779 
screw usually somewhere here that would
possibly<00:02:06.930> help<00:02:07.560> me<00:02:07.710> to<00:02:07.890> adjust<00:02:07.979> it<00:02:08.340> because

00:02:08.779 --> 00:02:08.789 
possibly help me to adjust it because

00:02:08.789 --> 00:02:11.930 
possibly help me to adjust it because
they're<00:02:09.209> set<00:02:10.080> up<00:02:10.110> currently<00:02:10.470> that<00:02:11.069> the<00:02:11.430> front

00:02:11.930 --> 00:02:11.940 
they're set up currently that the front

00:02:11.940 --> 00:02:13.559 
they're set up currently that the front
brake<00:02:12.420> is<00:02:12.720> sly

00:02:13.559 --> 00:02:13.569 
brake is sly

00:02:13.569 --> 00:02:16.289 
brake is sly
plea<00:02:13.780> weaker<00:02:14.530> than<00:02:14.799> the<00:02:15.040> back<00:02:15.280> which<00:02:16.030> means

00:02:16.289 --> 00:02:16.299 
plea weaker than the back which means

00:02:16.299 --> 00:02:19.199 
plea weaker than the back which means
that<00:02:16.510> isn't<00:02:16.840> symmetrical<00:02:17.290> which<00:02:18.280> really<00:02:18.849> bugs

00:02:19.199 --> 00:02:19.209 
that isn't symmetrical which really bugs

00:02:19.209 --> 00:02:23.910 
that isn't symmetrical which really bugs
me<00:02:19.329> actually<00:02:20.609> and<00:02:21.609> here's<00:02:22.060> the<00:02:22.329> Sigma<00:02:23.290> thingy

00:02:23.910 --> 00:02:23.920 
me actually and here's the Sigma thingy

00:02:23.920 --> 00:02:27.420 
me actually and here's the Sigma thingy
that<00:02:24.310> shows<00:02:24.519> how<00:02:24.730> much<00:02:24.879> I<00:02:25.060> have<00:02:25.180> done<00:02:25.389> and<00:02:26.430> the

00:02:27.420 --> 00:02:27.430 
that shows how much I have done and the

00:02:27.430 --> 00:02:28.860 
that shows how much I have done and the
thing<00:02:27.609> but<00:02:27.760> this<00:02:27.879> Sigma<00:02:28.239> thing<00:02:28.389> is<00:02:28.569> that<00:02:28.840> I

00:02:28.860 --> 00:02:28.870 
thing but this Sigma thing is that I

00:02:28.870 --> 00:02:31.559 
thing but this Sigma thing is that I
really<00:02:29.499> wanted<00:02:29.739> to<00:02:29.859> have<00:02:30.010> one<00:02:30.250> with<00:02:30.569> has

00:02:31.559 --> 00:02:31.569 
really wanted to have one with has

00:02:31.569 --> 00:02:35.759 
really wanted to have one with has
average<00:02:32.019> speed<00:02:32.879> but<00:02:34.139> the<00:02:35.139> ones<00:02:35.319> that<00:02:35.409> have<00:02:35.530> the

00:02:35.759 --> 00:02:35.769 
average speed but the ones that have the

00:02:35.769 --> 00:02:37.619 
average speed but the ones that have the
average<00:02:35.920> speed<00:02:36.340> the<00:02:36.579> max<00:02:36.790> speed<00:02:37.000> also<00:02:37.420> come

00:02:37.619 --> 00:02:37.629 
average speed the max speed also come

00:02:37.629 --> 00:02:40.379 
average speed the max speed also come
with<00:02:37.659> a<00:02:37.840> bunch<00:02:38.230> of<00:02:38.439> weird-ass<00:02:38.980> functions<00:02:39.609> well

00:02:40.379 --> 00:02:40.389 
with a bunch of weird-ass functions well

00:02:40.389 --> 00:02:43.979 
with a bunch of weird-ass functions well
this<00:02:40.569> one<00:02:40.719> actually<00:02:40.870> has<00:02:41.200> just<00:02:41.590> one<00:02:42.180> fuel<00:02:43.180> how

00:02:43.979 --> 00:02:43.989 
this one actually has just one fuel how

00:02:43.989 --> 00:02:48.000 
this one actually has just one fuel how
much<00:02:44.230> fuel<00:02:44.650> you've<00:02:44.950> saved<00:02:45.689> which<00:02:46.689> if<00:02:47.560> you're

00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:48.010 
much fuel you've saved which if you're

00:02:48.010 --> 00:02:50.490 
much fuel you've saved which if you're
really<00:02:48.280> eco<00:02:48.819> conscious<00:02:49.120> and<00:02:49.689> ride<00:02:49.930> a<00:02:49.959> bike<00:02:50.290> me

00:02:50.490 --> 00:02:50.500 
really eco conscious and ride a bike me

00:02:50.500 --> 00:02:52.890 
really eco conscious and ride a bike me
mostly<00:02:51.340> to<00:02:51.730> save<00:02:52.090> the<00:02:52.299> planet<00:02:52.480> that's

00:02:52.890 --> 00:02:52.900 
mostly to save the planet that's

00:02:52.900 --> 00:02:54.030 
mostly to save the planet that's
perfectly<00:02:53.319> fine

00:02:54.030 --> 00:02:54.040 
perfectly fine

00:02:54.040 --> 00:02:57.929 
perfectly fine
but<00:02:55.109> for<00:02:56.109> me<00:02:56.319> at<00:02:56.469> least<00:02:56.500> it's<00:02:56.939> completely

00:02:57.929 --> 00:02:57.939 
but for me at least it's completely

00:02:57.939 --> 00:03:01.080 
but for me at least it's completely
useless<00:02:58.739> but<00:02:59.739> well<00:03:00.040> it<00:03:00.219> doesn't<00:03:00.489> bug<00:03:00.879> me<00:03:00.909> that

00:03:01.080 --> 00:03:01.090 
useless but well it doesn't bug me that

00:03:01.090 --> 00:03:04.559 
useless but well it doesn't bug me that
much<00:03:01.359> just<00:03:02.019> something<00:03:02.469> yeah<00:03:03.430> silly<00:03:04.030> another

00:03:04.559 --> 00:03:04.569 
much just something yeah silly another

00:03:04.569 --> 00:03:07.530 
much just something yeah silly another
thing<00:03:04.780> with<00:03:04.989> the<00:03:05.019> Sigma's<00:03:05.500> is<00:03:05.650> that<00:03:05.889> I<00:03:06.540> usually

00:03:07.530 --> 00:03:07.540 
thing with the Sigma's is that I usually

00:03:07.540 --> 00:03:09.809 
thing with the Sigma's is that I usually
tell<00:03:07.810> people<00:03:07.840> that<00:03:08.319> have<00:03:08.709> these<00:03:09.010> that<00:03:09.430> it's

00:03:09.809 --> 00:03:09.819 
tell people that have these that it's

00:03:09.819 --> 00:03:13.589 
tell people that have these that it's
the<00:03:10.239> wisest<00:03:10.750> to<00:03:10.930> just<00:03:11.169> this<00:03:12.010> stand<00:03:12.599> they

00:03:13.589 --> 00:03:13.599 
the wisest to just this stand they

00:03:13.599 --> 00:03:16.289 
the wisest to just this stand they
usually<00:03:14.139> are<00:03:14.560> like<00:03:14.769> twist<00:03:15.219> and<00:03:15.489> remove<00:03:15.669> remove

00:03:16.289 --> 00:03:16.299 
usually are like twist and remove remove

00:03:16.299 --> 00:03:19.080 
usually are like twist and remove remove
however<00:03:17.290> I<00:03:17.560> usually<00:03:17.590> glue<00:03:18.579> them<00:03:18.819> into<00:03:18.970> place

00:03:19.080 --> 00:03:19.090 
however I usually glue them into place

00:03:19.090 --> 00:03:21.210 
however I usually glue them into place
because<00:03:19.720> they<00:03:19.840> have<00:03:19.989> the<00:03:20.109> last<00:03:20.319> a<00:03:20.500> tendency<00:03:21.040> of

00:03:21.210 --> 00:03:21.220 
because they have the last a tendency of

00:03:21.220 --> 00:03:23.280 
because they have the last a tendency of
falling<00:03:21.849> off<00:03:22.030> when<00:03:22.479> you're<00:03:22.689> carrying<00:03:22.989> the

00:03:23.280 --> 00:03:23.290 
falling off when you're carrying the

00:03:23.290 --> 00:03:26.159 
falling off when you're carrying the
bike<00:03:23.500> or<00:03:24.000> sometimes<00:03:25.000> just<00:03:25.299> at<00:03:25.419> random<00:03:25.930> times

00:03:26.159 --> 00:03:26.169 
bike or sometimes just at random times

00:03:26.169 --> 00:03:27.899 
bike or sometimes just at random times
when<00:03:26.530> there's<00:03:26.709> a<00:03:26.799> harder<00:03:27.129> hit<00:03:27.340> or<00:03:27.489> something

00:03:27.899 --> 00:03:27.909 
when there's a harder hit or something

00:03:27.909 --> 00:03:31.860 
when there's a harder hit or something
so<00:03:28.750> but<00:03:29.139> tiny<00:03:29.379> bit<00:03:29.680> of<00:03:29.799> superglue<00:03:30.519> and<00:03:30.849> I<00:03:31.150> mean

00:03:31.860 --> 00:03:31.870 
so but tiny bit of superglue and I mean

00:03:31.870 --> 00:03:34.979 
so but tiny bit of superglue and I mean
no<00:03:32.049> one<00:03:32.079> steals<00:03:32.560> these<00:03:32.859> things<00:03:33.129> anyway<00:03:33.989> so

00:03:34.979 --> 00:03:34.989 
no one steals these things anyway so

00:03:34.989 --> 00:03:41.069 
no one steals these things anyway so
yeah<00:03:36.479> it's<00:03:37.479> that<00:03:37.750> now<00:03:38.259> front<00:03:38.919> is<00:03:39.129> done<00:03:39.780> fork<00:03:40.780> I

00:03:41.069 --> 00:03:41.079 
yeah it's that now front is done fork I

00:03:41.079 --> 00:03:43.740 
yeah it's that now front is done fork I
have<00:03:41.530> absolutely<00:03:42.370> no<00:03:42.759> issues<00:03:43.150> with<00:03:43.180> the<00:03:43.389> fork

00:03:43.740 --> 00:03:43.750 
have absolutely no issues with the fork

00:03:43.750 --> 00:03:47.429 
have absolutely no issues with the fork
it's<00:03:43.930> really<00:03:44.439> nice<00:03:44.680> to<00:03:44.709> ride<00:03:45.220> and<00:03:46.439> yeah

00:03:47.429 --> 00:03:47.439 
it's really nice to ride and yeah

00:03:47.439 --> 00:03:49.860 
it's really nice to ride and yeah
completely<00:03:48.129> nothing<00:03:49.030> that<00:03:49.269> I<00:03:49.299> can<00:03:49.540> say<00:03:49.689> not

00:03:49.860 --> 00:03:49.870 
completely nothing that I can say not

00:03:49.870 --> 00:03:52.050 
completely nothing that I can say not
good<00:03:50.139> not<00:03:50.379> bad<00:03:50.439> just<00:03:51.220> there<00:03:51.609> and<00:03:51.909> I<00:03:52.000> think

00:03:52.050 --> 00:03:52.060 
good not bad just there and I think

00:03:52.060 --> 00:03:55.050 
good not bad just there and I think
that's<00:03:52.329> how<00:03:52.540> it's<00:03:52.720> supposed<00:03:53.079> to<00:03:53.229> be<00:03:54.060> the

00:03:55.050 --> 00:03:55.060 
that's how it's supposed to be the

00:03:55.060 --> 00:03:57.929 
that's how it's supposed to be the
wheels<00:03:55.359> I'm<00:03:56.049> still<00:03:56.590> running<00:03:56.949> the<00:03:57.159> DD<00:03:57.519> Swiss

00:03:57.929 --> 00:03:57.939 
wheels I'm still running the DD Swiss

00:03:57.939 --> 00:04:01.439 
wheels I'm still running the DD Swiss
stem<00:03:58.329> 1700s<00:03:59.319> I<00:03:59.530> know<00:04:00.280> I<00:04:00.639> was<00:04:01.060> planning<00:04:01.419> to

00:04:01.439 --> 00:04:01.449 
stem 1700s I know I was planning to

00:04:01.449 --> 00:04:04.559 
stem 1700s I know I was planning to
upgrade<00:04:01.689> them<00:04:02.169> but<00:04:02.469> well<00:04:03.310> situation<00:04:04.090> changed

00:04:04.559 --> 00:04:04.569 
upgrade them but well situation changed

00:04:04.569 --> 00:04:06.839 
upgrade them but well situation changed
and<00:04:04.780> I<00:04:05.019> actually<00:04:05.229> figured<00:04:06.219> out<00:04:06.459> that<00:04:06.669> these

00:04:06.839 --> 00:04:06.849 
and I actually figured out that these

00:04:06.849 --> 00:04:08.490 
and I actually figured out that these
wheels<00:04:07.120> are<00:04:07.389> quite<00:04:07.750> okay<00:04:08.109> they're<00:04:08.379> not

00:04:08.490 --> 00:04:08.500 
wheels are quite okay they're not

00:04:08.500 --> 00:04:12.390 
wheels are quite okay they're not
horribly<00:04:09.189> heavy<00:04:09.579> think<00:04:10.530> 1.7<00:04:11.530> kilos<00:04:11.979> the<00:04:12.219> wheel

00:04:12.390 --> 00:04:12.400 
horribly heavy think 1.7 kilos the wheel

00:04:12.400 --> 00:04:16.949 
horribly heavy think 1.7 kilos the wheel
set<00:04:12.729> and<00:04:13.469> actually<00:04:14.939> they're<00:04:15.939> pretty<00:04:16.359> strong<00:04:16.719> I

00:04:16.949 --> 00:04:16.959 
set and actually they're pretty strong I

00:04:16.959 --> 00:04:18.959 
set and actually they're pretty strong I
mean<00:04:17.079> they<00:04:17.199> survived<00:04:17.650> my<00:04:17.949> crash<00:04:18.280> without<00:04:18.699> any

00:04:18.959 --> 00:04:18.969 
mean they survived my crash without any

00:04:18.969 --> 00:04:22.769 
mean they survived my crash without any
problem<00:04:19.509> whatsoever<00:04:19.630> and<00:04:20.609> yeah<00:04:21.609> they<00:04:21.969> seem<00:04:22.570> to

00:04:22.769 --> 00:04:22.779 
problem whatsoever and yeah they seem to

00:04:22.779 --> 00:04:25.339 
problem whatsoever and yeah they seem to
be<00:04:22.930> perfectly<00:04:23.889> fine<00:04:24.130> again<00:04:24.490> something<00:04:24.849> that

00:04:25.339 --> 00:04:25.349 
be perfectly fine again something that

00:04:25.349 --> 00:04:27.420 
be perfectly fine again something that
currently<00:04:26.349> isn't<00:04:26.529> on<00:04:26.770> my<00:04:26.919> mind<00:04:27.190> of

00:04:27.420 --> 00:04:27.430 
currently isn't on my mind of

00:04:27.430 --> 00:04:31.110 
currently isn't on my mind of
doing<00:04:28.080> so<00:04:29.080> out<00:04:29.650> of<00:04:29.710> the<00:04:29.919> frame<00:04:30.220> still<00:04:30.789> looking

00:04:31.110 --> 00:04:31.120 
doing so out of the frame still looking

00:04:31.120 --> 00:04:36.689 
doing so out of the frame still looking
sexy<00:04:32.039> sexy<00:04:33.630> yeah<00:04:34.630> anyway<00:04:35.169> but<00:04:35.440> dirty<00:04:35.680> but<00:04:36.070> it's

sexy sexy yeah anyway but dirty but it's

00:04:36.699 --> 00:04:41.219 
sexy sexy yeah anyway but dirty but it's
expected<00:04:37.270> of<00:04:39.060> the<00:04:40.060> frame<00:04:40.300> I<00:04:40.419> have<00:04:40.449> absolutely

00:04:41.219 --> 00:04:41.229 
expected of the frame I have absolutely

00:04:41.229 --> 00:04:44.300 
expected of the frame I have absolutely
no<00:04:41.560> issues<00:04:41.919> the<00:04:42.070> bike<00:04:42.250> is<00:04:42.400> really<00:04:42.789> really

00:04:44.300 --> 00:04:44.310 
no issues the bike is really really

00:04:44.310 --> 00:04:49.100 
no issues the bike is really really
responsive<00:04:45.310> and<00:04:45.610> handles<00:04:46.570> like<00:04:46.780> a<00:04:46.840> dream<00:04:46.960> and

00:04:49.100 --> 00:04:49.110 
responsive and handles like a dream and

00:04:49.110 --> 00:04:51.659 
responsive and handles like a dream and
yeah<00:04:50.110> with<00:04:50.440> the<00:04:50.560> rear<00:04:50.710> suspension<00:04:50.919> I've<00:04:51.370> I

00:04:51.659 --> 00:04:51.669 
yeah with the rear suspension I've I

00:04:51.669 --> 00:04:54.390 
yeah with the rear suspension I've I
have<00:04:51.910> this<00:04:52.300> nasty<00:04:52.690> feeling<00:04:53.530> that<00:04:53.710> it<00:04:53.830> might<00:04:54.160> be

00:04:54.390 --> 00:04:54.400 
have this nasty feeling that it might be

00:04:54.400 --> 00:04:58.110 
have this nasty feeling that it might be
losing<00:04:54.610> pressure<00:04:55.150> slowly<00:04:56.130> however<00:04:57.130> I<00:04:57.250> can't

00:04:58.110 --> 00:04:58.120 
losing pressure slowly however I can't

00:04:58.120 --> 00:05:01.260 
losing pressure slowly however I can't
just<00:04:58.509> yet<00:04:58.780> prove<00:04:59.530> it<00:04:59.830> that<00:05:00.099> just<00:05:00.460> beam<00:05:00.669> just

00:05:01.260 --> 00:05:01.270 
just yet prove it that just beam just

00:05:01.270 --> 00:05:03.540 
just yet prove it that just beam just
might<00:05:01.539> be<00:05:01.750> me<00:05:02.020> being<00:05:02.380> paranoid<00:05:02.680> about<00:05:03.190> the

00:05:03.540 --> 00:05:03.550 
might be me being paranoid about the

00:05:03.550 --> 00:05:07.080 
might be me being paranoid about the
bike<00:05:03.729> being<00:05:04.030> in<00:05:04.330> a<00:05:04.419> perfect<00:05:04.840> shape<00:05:05.199> and<00:05:06.090> well

00:05:07.080 --> 00:05:07.090 
bike being in a perfect shape and well

00:05:07.090 --> 00:05:09.779 
bike being in a perfect shape and well
yeah<00:05:07.449> anyway<00:05:08.610> yeah

Prem great a shifting in the rear is

00:05:13.270 --> 00:05:18.240 
Prem great a shifting in the rear is
done<00:05:13.840> by<00:05:14.139> Shimano<00:05:16.500> 6001<00:05:17.500> being<00:05:17.770> a<00:05:17.830> pig<00:05:18.070> in<00:05:18.160> the

00:05:28.680 --> 00:05:28.690 
XD and the rear shifts actually really

00:05:28.690 --> 00:05:30.870 
XD and the rear shifts actually really
nicely<00:05:28.960> doesn't<00:05:29.349> make<00:05:29.590> any<00:05:29.830> extra<00:05:30.039> noises<00:05:30.639> and

00:05:30.870 --> 00:05:30.880 
nicely doesn't make any extra noises and

00:05:30.880 --> 00:05:33.779 
nicely doesn't make any extra noises and
I<00:05:31.470> mostly<00:05:32.470> don't<00:05:32.740> have<00:05:32.979> absolutely<00:05:33.580> any

00:05:33.779 --> 00:05:33.789 
I mostly don't have absolutely any

I mostly don't have absolutely any
issues<00:05:34.300> whatsoever<00:05:34.750> with<00:05:35.289> the<00:05:36.099> shifting<00:05:36.520> in

00:05:36.689 --> 00:05:36.699 
issues whatsoever with the shifting in

00:05:36.699 --> 00:05:40.649 
issues whatsoever with the shifting in
the<00:05:36.820> back<00:05:37.349> and<00:05:38.909> now<00:05:39.909> there's<00:05:40.150> stuff<00:05:40.389> growing

00:05:40.649 --> 00:05:40.659 
the back and now there's stuff growing

00:05:40.659 --> 00:05:45.570 
the back and now there's stuff growing
in<00:05:40.870> my<00:05:41.050> bike<00:05:43.110> anyway<00:05:44.139> shifting<00:05:45.039> is<00:05:45.159> perfectly

00:05:45.570 --> 00:05:45.580 
in my bike anyway shifting is perfectly

00:05:45.580 --> 00:05:50.370 
in my bike anyway shifting is perfectly
fine<00:05:46.260> the<00:05:47.260> front<00:05:47.680> it<00:05:48.520> shifts<00:05:49.389> well<00:05:49.840> but<00:05:50.229> it

00:05:50.370 --> 00:05:50.380 
fine the front it shifts well but it

00:05:50.380 --> 00:05:52.379 
fine the front it shifts well but it
keeps<00:05:50.680> making<00:05:50.919> noise<00:05:51.460> but<00:05:51.760> I<00:05:51.820> can't<00:05:52.120> figure

00:05:52.379 --> 00:05:52.389 
keeps making noise but I can't figure

00:05:52.389 --> 00:05:55.260 
keeps making noise but I can't figure
out<00:05:52.630> from<00:05:52.900> where<00:05:52.990> I<00:05:53.830> mean<00:05:54.789> yeah<00:05:54.970> I<00:05:55.000> know

00:05:55.260 --> 00:05:55.270 
out from where I mean yeah I know

00:05:55.270 --> 00:05:58.260 
out from where I mean yeah I know
currently<00:05:55.690> it's<00:05:55.900> touching<00:05:56.470> the<00:05:57.270> shifters

00:05:58.260 --> 00:05:58.270 
currently it's touching the shifters

00:05:58.270 --> 00:06:01.050 
currently it's touching the shifters
touching<00:05:58.659> the<00:05:58.780> chain<00:05:59.050> but<00:05:59.550> no<00:06:00.550> matter<00:06:00.729> how<00:06:00.880> you

00:06:01.050 --> 00:06:01.060 
touching the chain but no matter how you

00:06:01.060 --> 00:06:02.760 
touching the chain but no matter how you
adjust<00:06:01.360> that<00:06:01.750> there's<00:06:01.960> still<00:06:02.229> this<00:06:02.409> tiny

00:06:02.760 --> 00:06:02.770 
adjust that there's still this tiny

00:06:02.770 --> 00:06:05.610 
adjust that there's still this tiny
weird<00:06:03.699> noise<00:06:04.000> coming<00:06:04.360> from<00:06:04.750> it<00:06:05.020> I<00:06:05.080> know<00:06:05.229> it's

00:06:05.610 --> 00:06:05.620 
weird noise coming from it I know it's

00:06:05.620 --> 00:06:06.749 
weird noise coming from it I know it's
not<00:06:05.770> the<00:06:05.949> bottom<00:06:06.099> bracket

00:06:06.749 --> 00:06:06.759 
not the bottom bracket

00:06:06.759 --> 00:06:09.899 
not the bottom bracket
I<00:06:06.909> know<00:06:07.360> it's<00:06:07.570> the<00:06:07.690> chain<00:06:08.050> but<00:06:08.580> to<00:06:09.580> find<00:06:09.789> out

00:06:09.899 --> 00:06:09.909 
I know it's the chain but to find out

00:06:09.909 --> 00:06:11.550 
I know it's the chain but to find out
where<00:06:10.150> it's<00:06:10.360> coming<00:06:10.570> from<00:06:10.690> I<00:06:10.960> would<00:06:11.020> actually

00:06:11.550 --> 00:06:11.560 
where it's coming from I would actually

00:06:11.560 --> 00:06:14.189 
where it's coming from I would actually
need<00:06:11.740> to<00:06:12.130> put<00:06:12.789> someone<00:06:13.030> on<00:06:13.210> the<00:06:13.479> bike<00:06:13.690> and<00:06:13.990> then

00:06:14.189 --> 00:06:14.199 
need to put someone on the bike and then

00:06:14.199 --> 00:06:15.779 
need to put someone on the bike and then
see<00:06:14.500> where<00:06:14.770> it's<00:06:14.949> touching<00:06:15.159> because<00:06:15.610> I<00:06:15.639> think

00:06:15.779 --> 00:06:15.789 
see where it's touching because I think

00:06:15.789 --> 00:06:17.670 
see where it's touching because I think
it<00:06:16.120> has<00:06:16.270> something<00:06:16.599> to<00:06:16.780> do<00:06:16.990> with<00:06:17.199> the<00:06:17.349> slightly

00:06:17.670 --> 00:06:17.680 
it has something to do with the slightly

00:06:17.680 --> 00:06:21.779 
it has something to do with the slightly
change<00:06:18.130> chain<00:06:18.490> line<00:06:18.759> when<00:06:19.620> when<00:06:20.789> the

00:06:21.779 --> 00:06:21.789 
change chain line when when the

00:06:21.789 --> 00:06:26.600 
change chain line when when the
suspension<00:06:22.419> is<00:06:22.780> under<00:06:23.139> like<00:06:23.860> compression<00:06:24.520> oh

00:06:26.600 --> 00:06:26.610 
suspension is under like compression oh

00:06:26.610 --> 00:06:29.339 
suspension is under like compression oh
the<00:06:27.610> pie<00:06:27.729> came<00:06:28.000> without<00:06:28.150> any<00:06:28.300> pedals<00:06:28.870> so<00:06:29.050> I<00:06:29.080> put

00:06:29.339 --> 00:06:29.349 
the pie came without any pedals so I put

00:06:29.349 --> 00:06:31.710 
the pie came without any pedals so I put
these<00:06:29.590> on<00:06:29.889> I<00:06:30.190> got<00:06:30.550> them<00:06:30.699> quite<00:06:30.940> cheaply<00:06:31.240> and<00:06:31.570> so

00:06:31.710 --> 00:06:31.720 
these on I got them quite cheaply and so

00:06:31.720 --> 00:06:34.969 
these on I got them quite cheaply and so
far<00:06:31.960> they're<00:06:32.520> yeah<00:06:33.550> serving<00:06:34.240> that<00:06:34.389> purpose

00:06:34.969 --> 00:06:34.979 
far they're yeah serving that purpose

00:06:34.979 --> 00:06:38.700 
far they're yeah serving that purpose
pretty<00:06:35.979> well<00:06:36.360> excel<00:06:37.360> see<00:06:37.690> can't<00:06:38.409> remember

00:06:38.700 --> 00:06:38.710 
pretty well excel see can't remember

00:06:38.710 --> 00:06:41.310 
pretty well excel see can't remember
what<00:06:38.979> it<00:06:39.159> stood<00:06:39.400> for<00:06:39.460> but<00:06:39.870> essentially<00:06:40.870> there

00:06:41.310 --> 00:06:41.320 
what it stood for but essentially there

00:06:41.320 --> 00:06:43.050 
what it stood for but essentially there
li<00:06:41.440> cheap<00:06:41.740> and<00:06:42.040> the<00:06:42.160> bearings<00:06:42.550> on<00:06:42.730> this<00:06:42.880> one

00:06:43.050 --> 00:06:43.060 
li cheap and the bearings on this one

00:06:43.060 --> 00:06:45.680 
li cheap and the bearings on this one
are<00:06:43.210> starting<00:06:43.600> to<00:06:43.720> die<00:06:43.930> about<00:06:44.680> the<00:06:44.830> other<00:06:44.950> one

00:06:45.680 --> 00:06:45.690 
are starting to die about the other one

00:06:45.690 --> 00:06:47.850 
are starting to die about the other one
and<00:06:46.690> the<00:06:46.840> other<00:06:46.870> ones<00:06:47.170> still<00:06:47.410> fine

00:06:47.850 --> 00:06:47.860 
and the other ones still fine

00:06:47.860 --> 00:06:50.250 
and the other ones still fine
so<00:06:48.310> right<00:06:48.820> fado<00:06:49.060> is<00:06:49.270> going<00:06:49.540> to<00:06:49.660> be<00:06:49.750> replaced

00:06:50.250 --> 00:06:50.260 
so right fado is going to be replaced

00:06:50.260 --> 00:06:52.800 
so right fado is going to be replaced
well<00:06:50.650> mostly<00:06:51.100> both<00:06:51.370> of<00:06:51.580> them<00:06:51.760> but<00:06:51.940> still<00:06:52.180> right

00:06:52.800 --> 00:06:52.810 
well mostly both of them but still right

00:06:52.810 --> 00:06:56.280 
well mostly both of them but still right
one's<00:06:53.080> going<00:06:53.290> to<00:06:53.380> break<00:06:54.690> what<00:06:55.690> I'm<00:06:55.810> really

00:06:56.280 --> 00:06:56.290 
one's going to break what I'm really

00:06:56.290 --> 00:06:57.720 
one's going to break what I'm really
what<00:06:56.470> I<00:06:56.500> really<00:06:56.860> miss<00:06:57.010> on<00:06:57.190> this<00:06:57.310> bike<00:06:57.550> is<00:06:57.700> a

00:06:57.720 --> 00:06:57.730 
what I really miss on this bike is a

00:06:57.730 --> 00:07:00.840 
what I really miss on this bike is a
dropper<00:06:58.450> post<00:06:58.710> that<00:06:59.710> would<00:06:59.950> be<00:07:00.160> really<00:07:00.730> nice

00:07:00.840 --> 00:07:00.850 
dropper post that would be really nice
