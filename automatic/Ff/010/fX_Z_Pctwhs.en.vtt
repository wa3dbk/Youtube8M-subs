00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.389 

a<00:00:00.060> team<00:00:00.750> I<00:00:00.930> wanted<00:00:01.260> to<00:00:01.319> do<00:00:01.410> a<00:00:01.439> quick<00:00:01.740> video<00:00:02.129> on

00:00:02.389 --> 00:00:02.399 
a team I wanted to do a quick video on

00:00:02.399 --> 00:00:05.260 
a team I wanted to do a quick video on
how<00:00:02.850> to<00:00:02.879> add<00:00:03.240> effects<00:00:03.600> into<00:00:04.080> a<00:00:04.110> monitor<00:00:04.740> mix

00:00:05.260 --> 00:00:05.270 
how to add effects into a monitor mix

00:00:05.270 --> 00:00:08.379 
how to add effects into a monitor mix
but<00:00:06.270> a<00:00:06.299> quick<00:00:06.600> note<00:00:06.930> before<00:00:07.170> I<00:00:07.500> get<00:00:07.680> into<00:00:07.799> it

00:00:08.379 --> 00:00:08.389 
but a quick note before I get into it

00:00:08.389 --> 00:00:11.749 
but a quick note before I get into it
remember<00:00:09.389> that<00:00:09.769> say<00:00:10.769> if<00:00:11.040> we<00:00:11.190> have<00:00:11.309> a<00:00:11.340> vocalist

00:00:11.749 --> 00:00:11.759 
remember that say if we have a vocalist

00:00:11.759 --> 00:00:14.450 
remember that say if we have a vocalist
for<00:00:11.910> instance<00:00:12.210> who<00:00:12.360> asked<00:00:12.719> for<00:00:13.250> effects<00:00:14.250> into

00:00:14.450 --> 00:00:14.460 
for instance who asked for effects into

00:00:14.460 --> 00:00:18.260 
for instance who asked for effects into
their<00:00:14.639> monitor<00:00:15.030> a<00:00:15.839> lot<00:00:16.710> of<00:00:16.830> times<00:00:17.039> that<00:00:17.520> those

00:00:18.260 --> 00:00:18.270 
their monitor a lot of times that those

00:00:18.270 --> 00:00:20.840 
their monitor a lot of times that those
effects<00:00:18.630> can<00:00:18.869> will<00:00:19.500> make<00:00:19.980> the<00:00:20.220> vocalist

00:00:20.840 --> 00:00:20.850 
effects can will make the vocalist

00:00:20.850 --> 00:00:22.550 
effects can will make the vocalist
perform<00:00:21.600> better<00:00:21.779> because<00:00:22.230> they<00:00:22.350> are<00:00:22.380> more

00:00:22.550 --> 00:00:22.560 
perform better because they are more

00:00:22.560 --> 00:00:24.650 
perform better because they are more
confident<00:00:23.010> and<00:00:23.220> their<00:00:23.880> makes<00:00:24.060> it<00:00:24.180> so<00:00:24.449> dry

00:00:24.650 --> 00:00:24.660 
confident and their makes it so dry

00:00:24.660 --> 00:00:27.349 
confident and their makes it so dry
sounding<00:00:25.109> but<00:00:25.800> also<00:00:25.949> be<00:00:26.220> aware<00:00:26.490> that<00:00:26.550> if<00:00:27.000> that

00:00:27.349 --> 00:00:27.359 
sounding but also be aware that if that

00:00:27.359 --> 00:00:29.810 
sounding but also be aware that if that
vocalist<00:00:27.930> becomes<00:00:28.260> pitchy

00:00:29.810 --> 00:00:29.820 
vocalist becomes pitchy

00:00:29.820 --> 00:00:32.209 
vocalist becomes pitchy
it<00:00:30.000> could<00:00:30.300> possibly<00:00:30.900> be<00:00:31.140> because<00:00:31.410> the<00:00:31.830> effects

00:00:32.209 --> 00:00:32.219 
it could possibly be because the effects

00:00:32.219 --> 00:00:36.950 
it could possibly be because the effects
are<00:00:34.790> modifying<00:00:35.790> their<00:00:36.000> mix<00:00:36.239> in<00:00:36.450> a<00:00:36.510> way<00:00:36.690> that

00:00:36.950 --> 00:00:36.960 
are modifying their mix in a way that

00:00:36.960 --> 00:00:40.040 
are modifying their mix in a way that
they<00:00:37.170> can't<00:00:37.380> accurately<00:00:37.559> hear<00:00:38.040> themselves<00:00:39.050> so

00:00:40.040 --> 00:00:40.050 
they can't accurately hear themselves so

00:00:40.050 --> 00:00:41.660 
they can't accurately hear themselves so
if<00:00:40.410> that's<00:00:40.680> the<00:00:40.860> case<00:00:41.010> you<00:00:41.190> know<00:00:41.280> dial<00:00:41.520> it<00:00:41.640> back

00:00:41.660 --> 00:00:41.670 
if that's the case you know dial it back

00:00:41.670 --> 00:00:42.500 
if that's the case you know dial it back
a<00:00:41.850> little<00:00:42.030> bit

00:00:42.500 --> 00:00:42.510 
a little bit

00:00:42.510 --> 00:00:47.319 
a little bit
anyways<00:00:43.440> so<00:00:43.860> how<00:00:44.280> to<00:00:44.340> do<00:00:44.550> it<00:00:44.700> it's<00:00:45.270> fairly<00:00:45.809> um<00:00:46.260> I

00:00:47.319 --> 00:00:47.329 
anyways so how to do it it's fairly um I

00:00:47.329 --> 00:00:49.220 
anyways so how to do it it's fairly um I
don't<00:00:48.329> want<00:00:48.420> to<00:00:48.570> say<00:00:48.660> intuitive<00:00:49.079> but<00:00:49.170> it's

00:00:49.220 --> 00:00:49.230 
don't want to say intuitive but it's

00:00:49.230 --> 00:00:51.920 
don't want to say intuitive but it's

00:01:31.880 --> 00:01:31.890 
like sending anything else to that mix

00:01:31.890 --> 00:01:33.770 
like sending anything else to that mix
you<00:01:32.310> know<00:01:32.400> got<00:01:32.579> sends<00:01:32.820> on<00:01:32.939> fader<00:01:32.970> selected<00:01:33.630> and

00:01:33.770 --> 00:01:33.780 
you know got sends on fader selected and

00:01:33.780 --> 00:01:36.969 
you know got sends on fader selected and
I'm<00:01:34.200> turning<00:01:34.500> this<00:01:34.619> up<00:01:34.829> to<00:01:35.070> send<00:01:35.310> it<00:01:35.400> to<00:01:35.430> here

00:01:36.969 --> 00:01:36.979 
I'm turning this up to send it to here

00:01:36.979 --> 00:01:41.120 
I'm turning this up to send it to here
so<00:01:37.979> that<00:01:38.430> they<00:01:38.729> now<00:01:38.939> have<00:01:39.299> effects<00:01:39.930> now<00:01:40.650> keep

00:01:41.120 --> 00:01:41.130 
so that they now have effects now keep

00:01:41.130 --> 00:01:43.280 
so that they now have effects now keep
in<00:01:41.280> mind<00:01:41.310> though<00:01:41.640> this<00:01:42.119> is<00:01:42.299> dependent<00:01:42.570> on<00:01:42.869> if

00:01:43.280 --> 00:01:43.290 
in mind though this is dependent on if

00:01:43.290 --> 00:01:47.600 
in mind though this is dependent on if
the<00:01:43.710> facts<00:01:43.920> are<00:01:44.040> actually<00:01:44.990> being<00:01:45.990> used<00:01:46.610> and

00:01:47.600 --> 00:01:47.610 
the facts are actually being used and

00:01:47.610 --> 00:01:50.630 
the facts are actually being used and
what<00:01:47.759> I<00:01:47.820> mean<00:01:48.000> by<00:01:48.119> that<00:01:48.270> is<00:01:49.040> turn<00:01:50.040> this<00:01:50.189> off<00:01:50.399> if

00:01:50.630 --> 00:01:50.640 
what I mean by that is turn this off if

00:01:50.640 --> 00:01:53.300 
what I mean by that is turn this off if
