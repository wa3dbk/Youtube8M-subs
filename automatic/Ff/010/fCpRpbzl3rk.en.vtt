00:00:34.819 --> 00:00:34.829 
in Texas in college high school all that

00:00:34.829 --> 00:00:37.010 
in Texas in college high school all that
stuff<00:00:35.130> he<00:00:35.670> was<00:00:35.880> tearing<00:00:36.239> it<00:00:36.300> up<00:00:36.450> and<00:00:36.750> he<00:00:36.899> was

00:00:37.010 --> 00:00:37.020

00:00:40.639 --> 00:00:40.649 
maybe he'll be able to have that spark

00:00:40.649 --> 00:00:42.139 
maybe he'll be able to have that spark
for<00:00:40.860> our<00:00:40.950> offense<00:00:41.370> that<00:00:41.489> we<00:00:41.610> need<00:00:41.820> me<00:00:42.000> and

00:00:42.139 --> 00:00:42.149 
for our offense that we need me and

00:00:42.149 --> 00:00:43.700

00:00:47.399 --> 00:00:49.040 
together so I'm hoping that we can go on
a<00:00:47.460> little<00:00:47.640> bit<00:00:47.730> of<00:00:47.820> a<00:00:47.879> hot<00:00:48.059> streak<00:00:48.510> that's

00:00:49.040 --> 00:00:49.050 
a little bit of a hot streak that's

00:00:49.050 --> 00:00:50.779 
a little bit of a hot streak that's
gonna<00:00:49.200> be<00:00:49.379> interesting<00:00:49.530> to<00:00:49.950> see<00:00:50.160> and<00:00:50.399> I<00:00:50.760> just

00:00:50.779 --> 00:00:50.789 
gonna be interesting to see and I just

00:00:50.789 --> 00:00:53.209 
gonna be interesting to see and I just
can't<00:00:51.390> wait<00:00:51.660> to<00:00:52.140> try<00:00:52.289> to<00:00:52.379> force<00:00:52.710> our<00:00:52.860> way<00:00:53.039> into

00:00:53.209 --> 00:00:53.219 
can't wait to try to force our way into

00:00:53.219 --> 00:00:54.770 
can't wait to try to force our way into
the<00:00:53.370> playoffs<00:00:53.760> here<00:00:54.059> and<00:00:54.180> that's<00:00:54.300> one<00:00:54.539> way<00:00:54.719> to

00:00:54.770 --> 00:00:54.780 
the playoffs here and that's one way to

00:00:54.780 --> 00:00:56.869 
the playoffs here and that's one way to
do<00:00:54.989> it<00:00:55.020> I<00:00:55.199> guess<00:00:55.430> slapping<00:00:56.430> the<00:00:56.520> ball<00:00:56.640> to<00:00:56.760> the

00:00:56.869 --> 00:00:56.879 
do it I guess slapping the ball to the

00:00:56.879 --> 00:00:59.060 
do it I guess slapping the ball to the
other<00:00:57.030> side<00:00:57.300> nice<00:00:57.840> hard<00:00:58.170> hit<00:00:58.230> and<00:00:58.620> the<00:00:58.710> second

00:00:59.060 --> 00:00:59.070 
other side nice hard hit and the second

00:00:59.070 --> 00:01:00.170 
other side nice hard hit and the second
baseman<00:00:59.219> couldn't<00:00:59.579> come<00:00:59.699> up<00:00:59.730> with<00:00:59.820> that<00:00:59.940> so<00:01:00.149> I

00:01:00.170 --> 00:01:00.180 
baseman couldn't come up with that so I

00:01:00.180 --> 00:01:01.910 
baseman couldn't come up with that so I
get<00:01:00.390> a<00:01:00.420> single<00:01:00.660> out<00:01:00.870> of<00:01:00.960> that<00:01:01.079> great<00:01:01.739> way<00:01:01.890> to

00:01:01.910 --> 00:01:01.920 
get a single out of that great way to

00:01:01.920 --> 00:01:04.640 
get a single out of that great way to
start<00:01:02.309> and<00:01:02.789> I<00:01:03.120> wish<00:01:03.420> that<00:01:03.660> my<00:01:03.780> Giants<00:01:04.409> would<00:01:04.559> be

00:01:04.640 --> 00:01:04.650 
start and I wish that my Giants would be

00:01:04.650 --> 00:01:06.649 
start and I wish that my Giants would be
doing<00:01:04.890> the<00:01:04.979> same<00:01:05.010> thing<00:01:05.519> me<00:01:05.820> and<00:01:05.850> my<00:01:06.180> dad<00:01:06.420> and

pretty<00:04:25.860> big<00:04:26.100> boats<00:04:26.400> out<00:04:26.639> there<00:04:26.669> too<00:04:27.060> I<00:04:27.090> don't

00:04:27.379 --> 00:04:27.389 
pretty big boats out there too I don't

00:04:27.389 --> 00:04:29.210 
pretty big boats out there too I don't
think<00:04:27.600> they<00:04:27.720> really<00:04:28.229> have<00:04:28.260> that<00:04:28.620> it's<00:04:29.070> more

00:04:29.210 --> 00:04:29.220 
think they really have that it's more

00:04:29.220 --> 00:04:31.040 
think they really have that it's more
like<00:04:29.400> canoes<00:04:29.850> when<00:04:30.180> I<00:04:30.210> watch<00:04:30.479> the<00:04:30.690> games<00:04:30.870> they

00:04:31.040 --> 00:04:31.050 
like canoes when I watch the games they

00:04:31.050 --> 00:04:32.930 
like canoes when I watch the games they
paddle<00:04:31.410> out<00:04:31.530> there<00:04:31.740> for<00:04:31.889> the<00:04:31.949> balls<00:04:32.160> not<00:04:32.760> hope

00:04:32.930 --> 00:04:32.940 
paddle out there for the balls not hope

00:04:32.940 --> 00:04:34.939 
paddle out there for the balls not hope
that<00:04:33.120> they<00:04:33.210> get<00:04:33.360> hit<00:04:33.570> on<00:04:33.720> the<00:04:33.810> fly<00:04:34.020> so<00:04:34.050> it's

00:04:34.939 --> 00:04:34.949 
that they get hit on the fly so it's

00:04:34.949 --> 00:04:36.650 
that they get hit on the fly so it's
interesting<00:04:35.280> but<00:04:35.610> I'm<00:04:35.729> battling<00:04:36.180> here<00:04:36.510> you
