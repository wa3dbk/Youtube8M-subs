00:00:03.720 --> 00:00:08.200
 Hello and welcome to a new one 

00:00:06.250 --> 00:00:10.570
 chip spot presented by sport.de 

00:00:08.200 --> 00:00:12.490
 I'm not resting enough and I want to 

00:00:10.570 --> 00:00:16.720
 present today munich 

00:00:12.490 --> 00:00:18.939
 luccin itself is a range ag carey that 

00:00:16.720 --> 00:00:21.269
 is preferably in the 

00:00:18.939 --> 00:00:23.920
 be played hotline 

00:00:21.269 --> 00:00:26.289
 and I just want this video 

00:00:23.920 --> 00:00:29.259
 The crafts of Lucien show as 

00:00:26.289 --> 00:00:30.730
 also a bit of his way of playing and 

00:00:29.259 --> 00:00:33.000
 Of course, first of all we look like 

00:00:30.730 --> 00:00:35.559
 always serious the craftsmanship then the 

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:37.270
 playfully and since we are with the 

00:00:35.559 --> 00:00:40.030
 craftsmanship makes it natural 

00:00:37.270 --> 00:00:40.840
 First, the passive game 

00:00:40.030 --> 00:00:45.039
 anzugucken 

00:00:40.840 --> 00:00:46.989
 the passive itself is called Sagittarius and 

00:00:45.039 --> 00:00:49.420
 every time you're one of his 

00:00:46.989 --> 00:00:50.070
 he does not use the skills 

00:00:49.420 --> 00:00:52.510
 protect 

00:00:50.070 --> 00:00:54.789
 and that means he gets one 

00:00:52.510 --> 00:00:56.500
 second car on the handle this one 

00:00:54.789 --> 00:00:58.719
 second car attack will follow immediately 

00:00:56.500 --> 00:01:01.899
 his first activated and caused 

00:00:58.719 --> 00:01:05.530
 a little less damage than the first car 

00:01:01.899 --> 00:01:08.110
 Attack by first craft is 

00:01:05.530 --> 00:01:11.140
 the penetrating light out 

00:01:08.110 --> 00:01:13.180
 An opponent targets himself and fires 

00:01:11.140 --> 00:01:16.360
 then a ball in a straight line 

00:01:13.180 --> 00:01:20.259
 from all opponents serve these straight 

00:01:16.360 --> 00:01:23.110
 Lines get damaged and damaged 

00:01:20.259 --> 00:01:25.450
 lucien's second craft is the flames 

00:01:23.110 --> 00:01:27.670
 shot books itself celebrates 

00:01:25.450 --> 00:01:31.570
 explosive bullet from what then at 

00:01:27.670 --> 00:01:34.149
 impact in a star-shaped pattern 

00:01:31.570 --> 00:01:36.250
 The impact itself explodes 

00:01:34.149 --> 00:01:38.020
 either the first opponent to which this 

00:01:36.250 --> 00:01:40.780
 craft meets or just stops on the 

00:01:38.020 --> 00:01:42.790
 maximum range and should lucien 

00:01:40.780 --> 00:01:44.140
 then attack the opponent 

00:01:42.790 --> 00:01:46.750
 The hit by the Schramm shot 

00:01:44.140 --> 00:01:50.920
 he got one for two seconds 

00:01:46.750 --> 00:01:53.439
 speed of machines is third skill 

00:01:50.920 --> 00:01:55.890
 the merciless persecution by him 

00:01:53.439 --> 00:01:59.020
 himself jumps a few meters forward 

00:01:55.890 --> 00:02:02.740
 and will be doing all motion 

00:01:59.020 --> 00:02:04.869
 limiting effects should go on 

00:02:02.740 --> 00:02:07.210
 opponent with the ultimate shower 

00:02:04.869 --> 00:02:10.220
 will be killed merciless 

00:02:07.210 --> 00:02:13.820
 tracking immediately reset 

00:02:10.220 --> 00:02:15.560
 lucien's assortment must mow down 

00:02:13.820 --> 00:02:18.500
 yourself can be during the ultimate 

00:02:15.560 --> 00:02:21.380
 move freely and he shoots very fast 

00:02:18.500 --> 00:02:23.450
 one after another his shots off the 

00:02:21.380 --> 00:02:26.180
 maximum number of shots you 

00:02:23.450 --> 00:02:29.470
 Scales with his attacks 

00:02:26.180 --> 00:02:32.240
 speed and should he 

00:02:29.470 --> 00:02:34.430
 merciless pursuit 

00:02:32.240 --> 00:02:36.260
 the ultimate in is not interrupted 

00:02:34.430 --> 00:02:37.520
 that means he can get a small one 

00:02:36.260 --> 00:02:40.610
 speed commanded 

00:02:37.520 --> 00:02:42.830
 the problem is unfortunately the minions 

00:02:40.610 --> 00:02:45.140
 can receive shots and just that 

00:02:42.830 --> 00:02:46.760
 make him and his ultimate lust very much 

00:02:45.140 --> 00:02:49.190
 Strong in the part because he decide 

00:02:46.760 --> 00:02:50.870
 Can he flood with it like me? 

00:02:49.190 --> 00:02:53.060
 that they are doing right now or for the moment 

00:02:50.870 --> 00:02:54.200
 retreat used against a bit 

00:02:53.060 --> 00:02:56.690
 to put under fire 

00:02:54.200 --> 00:02:58.430
 that's a nice thing 

00:02:56.690 --> 00:02:59.800
 disadvantage of the ultimate is it can of 

00:02:58.430 --> 00:03:02.480
 minions are blocked 

00:02:59.800 --> 00:03:05.000
 The ultimate causes massive indeed 

00:03:02.480 --> 00:03:07.520
 more harm but still in a few 

00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:10.610
 Lost shots and you should 

00:03:07.520 --> 00:03:13.430
 of course change is otherwise let him 

00:03:10.610 --> 00:03:15.830
 in the beginning very strong just through his 

00:03:13.430 --> 00:03:17.930
 passively he can already the opponent on 

00:03:15.830 --> 00:03:19.580
 put a lot of pressure on the beginning 

00:03:17.930 --> 00:03:22.010
 so raven knows and the 

00:03:19.580 --> 00:03:25.430
 initial phase of raven lion's skin in 

00:03:22.010 --> 00:03:26.600
 have the same score and two things 

00:03:25.430 --> 00:03:28.130
 I still have to comment here 

00:03:26.600 --> 00:03:29.989
 before we look at it further 

00:03:28.130 --> 00:03:32.890
 first here you can see the 

00:03:29.989 --> 00:03:35.630
 graphical revision of the master key 

00:03:32.890 --> 00:03:39.440
 which was as I said in the graph and 

00:03:35.630 --> 00:03:41.890
 adapted to the skills and I play 

00:03:39.440 --> 00:03:45.440
 right here through him with his first 

00:03:41.890 --> 00:03:46.760
 Buyable skin in the crafts 

00:03:45.440 --> 00:03:49.220
 Survey I have you normal skin 

00:03:46.760 --> 00:03:52.160
 shown and here in the divides the 

00:03:49.220 --> 00:03:55.910
 The first you can buy otherwise 

00:03:52.160 --> 00:03:58.640
 Saying was a lot of fun 

00:03:55.910 --> 00:04:00.769
 he is not fcc possibilities so 

00:03:58.640 --> 00:04:02.930
 not mine lob but that is not 

00:04:00.769 --> 00:04:06.980
 not so bad because he is very very 

00:04:02.930 --> 00:04:09.019
 movable once by his ability 

00:04:06.980 --> 00:04:11.930
 he sprints on the internet forward 

00:04:09.019 --> 00:04:12.880
 so merciless pursuit as well 

00:04:11.930 --> 00:04:16.750
 his 

00:04:12.880 --> 00:04:19.250
 flaming the cool shot on the river 

00:04:16.750 --> 00:04:21.820
 if you attack against it then 

00:04:19.250 --> 00:04:24.350
 you have to get him for two more seconds 

00:04:21.820 --> 00:04:26.870
 speed of movement but you have to 

00:04:24.350 --> 00:04:28.880
 Do not attack the opponent directly 

00:04:26.870 --> 00:04:30.260
 enough even if the red boys from 

00:04:28.880 --> 00:04:32.660
 has the boy and the one there on the 

00:04:30.260 --> 00:04:36.680
 opponents occur as well as the blade of the 

00:04:32.660 --> 00:04:39.350
 lizard elders also solves there 

00:04:36.680 --> 00:04:40.700
 then in the frank shot from the we here 

00:04:39.350 --> 00:04:42.650
 right now I can see that use around 

00:04:40.700 --> 00:04:44.690
 to cut through the there and then stop 

00:04:42.650 --> 00:04:45.890
 with the ultimate to the opponent 

00:04:44.690 --> 00:04:48.530
 destroy 

00:04:45.890 --> 00:04:50.890
 So in any case a very nice 

00:04:48.530 --> 00:04:54.650
 History only with the flames shot 

00:04:50.890 --> 00:04:56.150
 otherwise I have to say he is lucien very much 

00:04:54.650 --> 00:04:57.860
 strong and made a lot of fun 

00:04:56.150 --> 00:04:59.240
 Normally I'm not like that 

00:04:57.860 --> 00:05:01.490
 hde carey fan 

00:04:59.240 --> 00:05:04.100
 this is not quite my area but 

00:05:01.490 --> 00:05:05.900
 just vote has definitely fun there 

00:05:04.100 --> 00:05:08.150
 also if normally like 

00:05:05.900 --> 00:05:10.550
 said that not man is area and me 

00:05:08.150 --> 00:05:14.030
 actually see a relatively good 

00:05:10.550 --> 00:05:17.090
 future as far as people are concerned 

00:05:14.030 --> 00:05:19.010
 as with quinn yes, now something in 

00:05:17.090 --> 00:05:22.280
 At the least, one should forget 

00:05:19.010 --> 00:05:25.310
 and that's it 

00:05:22.280 --> 00:05:27.230
 I accompany with the champions again 

00:05:25.310 --> 00:05:28.669
 I liked it and I hope we 

00:05:27.230 --> 00:05:31.690
 See you next time again 

00:05:28.669 --> 00:05:31.690
 then bite
