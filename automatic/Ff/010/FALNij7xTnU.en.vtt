because I mean really if you play the

00:04:33.400 --> 00:04:35.909 
because I mean really if you play the
other<00:04:33.490> side<00:04:33.759> three<00:04:34.030> games<00:04:34.210> you<00:04:35.169> can<00:04:35.349> you<00:04:35.680> think

00:04:35.909 --> 00:04:35.919 
other side three games you can you think

00:04:35.919 --> 00:04:37.110 
other side three games you can you think
about<00:04:36.069> it<00:04:36.400> and<00:04:36.490> you<00:04:36.550> think<00:04:36.580> what<00:04:36.909> other

00:04:37.110 --> 00:04:37.120 
about it and you think what other

00:04:37.120 --> 00:04:39.629 
about it and you think what other
purpose<00:04:37.419> were<00:04:38.319> there<00:04:38.560> to<00:04:38.680> be<00:04:38.800> relive<00:04:39.189> any<00:04:39.400> more

00:04:39.629 --> 00:04:39.639 
purpose were there to be relive any more

00:04:39.639 --> 00:04:42.779 
purpose were there to be relive any more
so<00:04:40.000> ancestors<00:04:40.750> memories<00:04:41.199> really<00:04:41.680> to<00:04:42.310> Desmond

so ancestors memories really to Desmond

00:04:42.789 --> 00:04:45.450 
so ancestors memories really to Desmond
other<00:04:42.939> than<00:04:43.180> to<00:04:43.389> solve<00:04:44.169> the<00:04:44.830> mysteries<00:04:45.189> of<00:04:45.219> the

00:04:45.450 --> 00:04:45.460 
other than to solve the mysteries of the

00:04:45.460 --> 00:04:46.589 
other than to solve the mysteries of the
things<00:04:45.639> he's<00:04:45.879> trying<00:04:46.150> to<00:04:46.210> search<00:04:46.330> for<00:04:46.539> in

00:04:46.589 --> 00:04:46.599 
things he's trying to search for in

00:04:46.599 --> 00:04:50.429 
things he's trying to search for in
modern<00:04:46.750> day<00:04:46.900> and<00:04:47.909> that<00:04:48.909> would<00:04:49.090> all<00:04:49.330> that<00:04:49.840> you

00:04:50.429 --> 00:04:50.439 
modern day and that would all that you

00:04:50.439 --> 00:04:51.990 
modern day and that would all that you
can<00:04:50.560> think<00:04:50.710> of<00:04:50.800> from<00:04:50.919> that<00:04:51.129> is<00:04:51.340> really<00:04:51.789> the

00:04:51.990 --> 00:04:52.000 
can think of from that is really the

00:04:52.000 --> 00:04:54.360 
can think of from that is really the
grand<00:04:52.719> temple<00:04:52.930> itself<00:04:53.349> the<00:04:53.889> year<00:04:54.189> and

00:04:54.360 --> 00:04:54.370 
grand temple itself the year and

00:04:54.370 --> 00:04:58.080 
grand temple itself the year and
revelations<00:04:55.300> so<00:04:56.789> we're<00:04:57.789> going<00:04:57.879> to<00:04:58.000> assume

00:04:58.080 --> 00:04:58.090 
revelations so we're going to assume

00:04:58.090 --> 00:05:02.490 
revelations so we're going to assume
that<00:04:59.639> ac3<00:05:00.639> is<00:05:00.879> going<00:05:01.690> to<00:05:01.750> link<00:05:01.960> Connors<00:05:02.289> life

00:05:02.490 --> 00:05:02.500 
that ac3 is going to link Connors life

00:05:02.500 --> 00:05:05.339 
that ac3 is going to link Connors life
and<00:05:02.800> in<00:05:03.550> the<00:05:03.669> end<00:05:03.789> of<00:05:03.940> this<00:05:04.060> game<00:05:04.569> will<00:05:04.960> link<00:05:05.229> it

00:05:05.339 --> 00:05:05.349 
and in the end of this game will link it

00:05:05.349 --> 00:05:09.839 
and in the end of this game will link it
all<00:05:05.500> to<00:05:05.710> Desmond<00:05:06.330> in<00:05:07.330> the<00:05:08.139> year<00:05:08.319> 2012<00:05:08.860> and<00:05:09.190> with

00:05:09.839 --> 00:05:09.849
