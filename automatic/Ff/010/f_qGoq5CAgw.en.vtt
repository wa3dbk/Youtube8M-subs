upper no underclassmen was ever make it

00:03:42.360 --> 00:03:44.449 
upper no underclassmen was ever make it
whatever<00:03:42.630> able<00:03:43.350> to<00:03:43.739> make<00:03:43.890> it<00:03:44.010> the<00:03:44.070> first<00:03:44.280> base

00:03:44.449 --> 00:03:44.459 
whatever able to make it the first base

00:03:44.459 --> 00:03:46.610 
whatever able to make it the first base
and<00:03:44.670> Asian<00:03:45.600> was<00:03:45.750> the<00:03:45.840> only<00:03:46.019> one<00:03:46.230> that<00:03:46.260> made<00:03:46.530> it

00:03:46.610 --> 00:03:46.620 
and Asian was the only one that made it

00:03:46.620 --> 00:03:49.490 
and Asian was the only one that made it
to<00:03:46.709> first<00:03:46.860> base<00:03:47.450> so<00:03:48.450> you<00:03:49.200> know<00:03:49.320> he

00:03:49.490 --> 00:03:49.500 
to first base so you know he

00:03:49.500 --> 00:03:51.289 
to first base so you know he
accomplished<00:03:50.010> something<00:03:50.160> hand<00:03:50.700> and<00:03:50.910> start<00:03:51.150> or

00:03:51.289 --> 00:03:51.299 
accomplished something hand and start or

accomplished something hand and start or
copy<00:03:51.630> of<00:03:51.690> something<00:03:52.250> cetera<00:03:53.250> he's<00:03:53.880> going<00:03:54.180> to

00:03:54.350 --> 00:03:54.360 
copy of something cetera he's going to

00:03:54.360 --> 00:03:56.300 
copy of something cetera he's going to
practice<00:03:55.290> with<00:03:55.530> the<00:03:55.620> upperclassmen<00:03:56.190> and

00:03:56.300 --> 00:03:56.310 
practice with the upperclassmen and

00:03:56.310 --> 00:03:58.850 
practice with the upperclassmen and
asian<00:03:57.299> you<00:03:57.420> know<00:03:57.450> he<00:03:58.320> didn't<00:03:58.500> get<00:03:58.560> to<00:03:58.680> play<00:03:58.799> a

00:03:58.850 --> 00:03:58.860 
asian you know he didn't get to play a

00:03:58.860 --> 00:04:01.190 
asian you know he didn't get to play a
picture<00:03:59.390> because<00:04:00.390> I<00:04:00.510> think<00:04:00.720> the<00:04:00.780> coach<00:04:00.989> the

00:04:01.190 --> 00:04:01.200 
picture because I think the coach the

00:04:01.200 --> 00:04:02.479 
picture because I think the coach the
coach<00:04:01.350> is<00:04:01.410> playing<00:04:01.739> around<00:04:01.920> him<00:04:02.190> that's<00:04:02.370> what

00:04:02.479 --> 00:04:02.489 
coach is playing around him that's what

00:04:02.489 --> 00:04:04.039 
coach is playing around him that's what
I<00:04:02.519> think<00:04:02.820> I<00:04:03.000> think<00:04:03.269> the<00:04:03.600> coach<00:04:03.750> is<00:04:03.780> going<00:04:03.989> to

00:04:04.039 --> 00:04:04.049 
I think I think the coach is going to

00:04:04.049 --> 00:04:05.690 
I think I think the coach is going to
mess<00:04:04.230> around<00:04:04.350> him<00:04:04.709> and<00:04:04.860> try<00:04:05.220> to<00:04:05.280> see<00:04:05.519> if<00:04:05.580> you

00:04:05.690 --> 00:04:05.700 
mess around him and try to see if you

00:04:05.700 --> 00:04:07.850 
mess around him and try to see if you
really<00:04:05.910> want<00:04:06.060> to<00:04:06.150> be<00:04:06.239> an<00:04:06.390> ace<00:04:06.590> because<00:04:07.590> they

00:04:07.850 --> 00:04:07.860 
really want to be an ace because they

00:04:07.860 --> 00:04:10.160 
really want to be an ace because they
need<00:04:08.430> the<00:04:08.760> upperclassmen<00:04:09.660> need<00:04:09.870> a<00:04:09.900> picture

00:04:10.160 --> 00:04:10.170 
need the upperclassmen need a picture

00:04:10.170 --> 00:04:12.979 
need the upperclassmen need a picture
because<00:04:11.100> the<00:04:11.299> picture<00:04:12.299> right<00:04:12.329> now<00:04:12.660> he's

00:04:12.979 --> 00:04:12.989 
because the picture right now he's

00:04:12.989 --> 00:04:17.120 
because the picture right now he's
slacking<00:04:13.500> and<00:04:15.380> Satoru<00:04:16.380> is<00:04:16.680> probably<00:04:16.950> going<00:04:17.070> to

00:04:17.120 --> 00:04:17.130 
slacking and Satoru is probably going to

00:04:17.130 --> 00:04:19.550 
slacking and Satoru is probably going to
be<00:04:17.190> the<00:04:17.280> pitcher<00:04:17.870> so<00:04:18.870> we<00:04:19.169> don't<00:04:19.290> know<00:04:19.410> where

00:04:19.550 --> 00:04:19.560 
be the pitcher so we don't know where

00:04:19.560 --> 00:04:22.039 
be the pitcher so we don't know where
they're<00:04:19.680> going<00:04:19.769> to<00:04:19.859> take<00:04:19.979> this<00:04:20.190> is<00:04:21.000> admin<00:04:21.540> for

00:04:22.039 --> 00:04:22.049 
they're going to take this is admin for

00:04:22.049 --> 00:04:25.630 
they're going to take this is admin for
my<00:04:22.200> review<00:04:22.560> on<00:04:22.970> ace<00:04:23.970> of<00:04:24.180> the<00:04:24.270> diamond<00:04:24.620> episode
