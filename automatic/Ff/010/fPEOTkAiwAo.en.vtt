00:00:26.110 --> 00:00:26.120 
but yeah that's about halfway through my

00:00:26.120 --> 00:00:27.670 
but yeah that's about halfway through my
my<00:00:26.570> mash<00:00:26.810> I'm<00:00:27.050> going<00:00:27.170> to<00:00:27.230> give<00:00:27.320> it<00:00:27.410> a<00:00:27.470> stir

00:00:27.670 --> 00:00:27.680 
my mash I'm going to give it a stir

00:00:37.540 --> 00:00:37.550 
giving it a stir halfway through is

00:00:37.550 --> 00:00:39.190 
giving it a stir halfway through is
supposed<00:00:37.790> to<00:00:37.940> supposed<00:00:38.720> to<00:00:38.840> help<00:00:38.989> with<00:00:39.020> to

00:00:39.190 --> 00:00:39.200 
supposed to supposed to help with to

00:00:39.200 --> 00:00:43.470 
supposed to supposed to help with to
your<00:00:39.290> efficiency

00:00:43.470 --> 00:00:43.480 

00:00:43.480 --> 00:00:46.780 

now<00:00:44.480> I<00:00:44.870> already<00:00:45.290> I<00:00:45.440> had<00:00:45.680> like<00:00:45.860> seven<00:00:46.190> pounds<00:00:46.640> of

00:00:46.780 --> 00:00:46.790 
now I already I had like seven pounds of

00:00:46.790 --> 00:00:48.729 
now I already I had like seven pounds of
grain<00:00:47.239> this<00:00:47.449> is<00:00:47.510> only<00:00:47.660> a<00:00:47.809> four<00:00:48.140> gallon<00:00:48.350> batch

00:00:48.729 --> 00:00:48.739 
grain this is only a four gallon batch

00:00:48.739 --> 00:00:52.660 
grain this is only a four gallon batch
and<00:00:49.100> my<00:00:50.260> pre-boiled<00:00:51.260> gravity<00:00:51.800> was<00:00:52.220> gonna<00:00:52.340> be

00:00:52.660 --> 00:00:52.670 
and my pre-boiled gravity was gonna be

00:00:52.670 --> 00:00:59.530 
and my pre-boiled gravity was gonna be
around<00:00:53.180> 10:45<00:00:53.780> time<00:00:54.320> 49<00:00:56.410> which<00:00:58.270> is<00:00:59.270> really

00:00:59.530 --> 00:00:59.540 
around 10:45 time 49 which is really

00:00:59.540 --> 00:01:04.660 
around 10:45 time 49 which is really
high<00:01:02.170> the<00:01:03.170> idea<00:01:03.410> comes<00:01:03.739> from<00:01:04.070> the<00:01:04.489> mana

00:01:04.660 --> 00:01:04.670 
high the idea comes from the mana

00:01:04.670 --> 00:01:07.150 
high the idea comes from the mana
fermentation<00:01:05.300> Asst<00:01:05.449> vlog<00:01:06.200> where<00:01:07.040> they

00:01:07.150 --> 00:01:07.160 
fermentation Asst vlog where they

00:01:07.160 --> 00:01:10.690 
fermentation Asst vlog where they
actually<00:01:07.310> do<00:01:07.550> an<00:01:07.670> O<00:01:07.790> boil<00:01:09.190> the<00:01:10.190> bringing<00:01:10.430> up<00:01:10.550> to

00:01:10.690 --> 00:01:10.700 
actually do an O boil the bringing up to

00:01:10.700 --> 00:01:13.719 
actually do an O boil the bringing up to
boil<00:01:11.259> maybe<00:01:12.259> for<00:01:12.619> five<00:01:12.890> minutes<00:01:13.160> and<00:01:13.369> then<00:01:13.490> cut

00:01:13.719 --> 00:01:13.729 
boil maybe for five minutes and then cut

00:01:13.729 --> 00:01:16.990 
boil maybe for five minutes and then cut
it<00:01:13.759> and<00:01:14.060> that's<00:01:14.360> it<00:01:15.280> on<00:01:16.280> his<00:01:16.490> side<00:01:16.670> he<00:01:16.820> did<00:01:16.970> a

00:01:16.990 --> 00:01:17.000 
it and that's it on his side he did a

00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:19.810 
it and that's it on his side he did a
decoction<00:01:17.450> where<00:01:18.410> he<00:01:18.740> did<00:01:19.490> a<00:01:19.520> single

00:01:19.810 --> 00:01:19.820 
decoction where he did a single

00:01:19.820 --> 00:01:23.170 
decoction where he did a single
decoction<00:01:20.180> and<00:01:21.100> boiled<00:01:22.100> some<00:01:22.640> hops<00:01:22.910> in<00:01:23.149> the

00:01:23.170 --> 00:01:23.180 
decoction and boiled some hops in the

00:01:23.180 --> 00:01:26.109 
decoction and boiled some hops in the
decoction<00:01:23.570> I'm<00:01:24.470> not<00:01:24.649> going<00:01:24.770> to<00:01:24.830> do<00:01:24.920> that<00:01:25.119> I'm

00:01:26.109 --> 00:01:26.119 
decoction I'm not going to do that I'm

00:01:26.119 --> 00:01:28.169 
decoction I'm not going to do that I'm
probably<00:01:26.300> going<00:01:26.509> to<00:01:26.600> do<00:01:26.660> it<00:01:26.780> first<00:01:26.960> wort<00:01:27.350> I

00:01:28.169 --> 00:01:28.179 
probably going to do it first wort I

00:01:28.179 --> 00:01:32.650 
probably going to do it first wort I
think<00:01:29.179> about<00:01:29.330> doing<00:01:29.479> no<00:01:29.720> hops<00:01:29.959> actually<00:01:30.500> a<00:01:31.660> lot

00:01:32.650 --> 00:01:32.660 
think about doing no hops actually a lot

00:01:32.660 --> 00:01:35.020 
think about doing no hops actually a lot
of<00:01:32.750> sour<00:01:32.990> makers<00:01:33.560> are<00:01:33.740> now<00:01:33.890> not<00:01:34.369> even<00:01:34.399> putting

00:01:35.020 --> 00:01:35.030 
of sour makers are now not even putting

00:01:35.030 --> 00:01:36.850 
of sour makers are now not even putting
any<00:01:35.240> hops<00:01:35.509> in<00:01:35.690> because<00:01:35.959> the<00:01:36.050> beta<00:01:36.259> ass<00:01:36.440> is<00:01:36.709> from

00:01:36.850 --> 00:01:36.860 
any hops in because the beta ass is from

00:01:36.860 --> 00:01:40.930 
any hops in because the beta ass is from
the<00:01:36.950> hops<00:01:38.470> don't<00:01:39.700> don't<00:01:40.700> let<00:01:40.819> the

00:01:40.930 --> 00:01:40.940 
the hops don't don't let the

00:01:40.940 --> 00:01:44.169 
the hops don't don't let the
lactobacillus<00:01:41.300> bacteria<00:01:42.849> propagate<00:01:43.849> as<00:01:44.000> well

00:01:44.169 --> 00:01:44.179 
lactobacillus bacteria propagate as well

00:01:44.179 --> 00:01:47.160 
lactobacillus bacteria propagate as well
as<00:01:44.360> it<00:01:44.479> should

00:01:47.160 --> 00:01:47.170 

00:01:47.170 --> 00:01:51.249 

so<00:01:49.149> I'm<00:01:50.149> probably<00:01:50.360> gonna<00:01:50.540> put<00:01:50.689> at<00:01:50.810> least<00:01:50.990> a

00:01:51.249 --> 00:01:51.259 
so I'm probably gonna put at least a

00:01:51.259 --> 00:01:52.870 
so I'm probably gonna put at least a
little<00:01:51.740> bit<00:01:51.860> of<00:01:51.979> hops<00:01:52.189> in<00:01:52.340> there<00:01:52.460> to<00:01:52.579> make<00:01:52.670> it<00:01:52.729> a

00:01:52.870 --> 00:01:52.880 
little bit of hops in there to make it a

00:01:52.880 --> 00:01:53.350 
little bit of hops in there to make it a
beer

00:01:53.350 --> 00:01:53.360 
beer

00:01:53.360 --> 00:01:56.139 
beer
because<00:01:53.869> without<00:01:54.229> hops<00:01:54.590> it's<00:01:55.430> not<00:01:55.610> a<00:01:55.640> beer<00:01:55.939> and

00:01:56.139 --> 00:01:56.149 
because without hops it's not a beer and

00:01:56.149 --> 00:01:59.560 
because without hops it's not a beer and
it's<00:01:56.270> not<00:01:56.450> Reinheitsgebot<00:01:57.140> which<00:01:57.979> is<00:01:58.130> a<00:01:58.570> you

00:01:59.560 --> 00:01:59.570 
it's not Reinheitsgebot which is a you

00:01:59.570 --> 00:02:00.730 
it's not Reinheitsgebot which is a you
know<00:01:59.600> should<00:01:59.960> be<00:01:59.990> respected<00:02:00.530> when<00:02:00.590> you're

00:02:00.730 --> 00:02:00.740 
know should be respected when you're

00:02:00.740 --> 00:02:05.020 
know should be respected when you're
doing<00:02:00.890> a<00:02:00.950> german-style<00:02:01.340> beer<00:02:01.610> I<00:02:01.850> think<00:02:03.820> so<00:02:04.820> I'm

00:02:05.020 --> 00:02:05.030 
doing a german-style beer I think so I'm

00:02:05.030 --> 00:02:06.219 
doing a german-style beer I think so I'm
gonna<00:02:05.119> let<00:02:05.299> this<00:02:05.420> sit<00:02:05.630> for<00:02:05.659> another<00:02:05.780> half<00:02:06.049> hour

00:02:06.219 --> 00:02:06.229 
gonna let this sit for another half hour

00:02:06.229 --> 00:02:10.479 
gonna let this sit for another half hour
and<00:02:07.810> I<00:02:08.810> just<00:02:08.840> collected<00:02:09.259> my<00:02:09.410> first<00:02:09.920> rings<00:02:10.190> in

00:02:10.479 --> 00:02:10.489 
and I just collected my first rings in

00:02:10.489 --> 00:02:12.670 
and I just collected my first rings in
my<00:02:10.519> Sparks<00:02:11.030> water<00:02:11.269> getting<00:02:11.569> ready<00:02:11.780> to<00:02:11.930> boil<00:02:12.500> it

00:02:12.670 --> 00:02:12.680 
my Sparks water getting ready to boil it

00:02:12.680 --> 00:02:16.990 
my Sparks water getting ready to boil it
up<00:02:13.090> in<00:02:14.090> honor<00:02:14.330> of<00:02:14.480> the<00:02:14.690> Reinheitsgebot<00:02:16.000> there

00:02:16.990 --> 00:02:17.000 
up in honor of the Reinheitsgebot there

00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:19.539 
up in honor of the Reinheitsgebot there

00:03:50.370 --> 00:03:50.380 
I'm gonna pitch the yeast I'm gonna

00:03:50.380 --> 00:03:52.170 
I'm gonna pitch the yeast I'm gonna
bring<00:03:50.500> the<00:03:50.650> wort<00:03:50.829> down<00:03:50.980> to<00:03:51.160> 68<00:03:51.549> degrees<00:03:51.880> and

00:03:52.170 --> 00:03:52.180 
bring the wort down to 68 degrees and

00:03:52.180 --> 00:03:55.770 
bring the wort down to 68 degrees and
then<00:03:52.900> pitch<00:03:53.079> the<00:03:53.230> yeast<00:03:54.150> so<00:03:55.150> we'll<00:03:55.540> see<00:03:55.660> how

00:03:55.770 --> 00:03:55.780 
then pitch the yeast so we'll see how

00:03:55.780 --> 00:03:58.020 
then pitch the yeast so we'll see how
sour<00:03:56.019> gets<00:03:56.410> that's<00:03:56.829> the<00:03:57.010> goal<00:03:57.190> so<00:03:57.819> I<00:03:57.880> wasn't

00:03:58.020 --> 00:03:58.030 
sour gets that's the goal so I wasn't

00:03:58.030 --> 00:03:59.759 
sour gets that's the goal so I wasn't
going<00:03:58.209> to<00:03:58.239> show<00:03:58.480> this<00:03:58.660> but<00:03:58.900> the<00:03:59.440> lactobacillus

00:03:59.759 --> 00:03:59.769 
going to show this but the lactobacillus

00:03:59.769 --> 00:04:02.610 
going to show this but the lactobacillus
is<00:04:00.450> just<00:04:01.450> about<00:04:01.569> 24<00:04:01.959> hours<00:04:02.230> after<00:04:02.349> pitching

00:04:02.610 --> 00:04:02.620 
is just about 24 hours after pitching

00:04:02.620 --> 00:04:06.870 
is just about 24 hours after pitching
the<00:04:02.829> lactobacillus<00:04:03.450> no<00:04:04.450> yeast<00:04:04.720> in<00:04:04.959> there<00:04:05.880> you

00:04:06.870 --> 00:04:06.880 
the lactobacillus no yeast in there you

00:04:06.880 --> 00:04:09.030 
the lactobacillus no yeast in there you
can<00:04:07.030> see<00:04:07.269> it's<00:04:07.540> got<00:04:07.660> a<00:04:07.690> big<00:04:08.139> frothy<00:04:08.680> head<00:04:08.709> on

00:04:09.030 --> 00:04:09.040 
can see it's got a big frothy head on

00:04:09.040 --> 00:04:14.130 
can see it's got a big frothy head on
there

00:04:14.130 --> 00:04:14.140 

00:04:14.140 --> 00:04:17.039 

and<00:04:14.320> quite<00:04:15.250> a<00:04:15.280> bit<00:04:15.430> of<00:04:15.550> carbon<00:04:15.850> dioxide<00:04:16.810> coming

00:04:17.039 --> 00:04:17.049 
and quite a bit of carbon dioxide coming

00:04:17.049 --> 00:04:20.400 
and quite a bit of carbon dioxide coming
out<00:04:18.239> so<00:04:19.239> the<00:04:19.329> lactobacillus<00:04:19.660> is<00:04:20.109> really

00:04:20.400 --> 00:04:20.410 
out so the lactobacillus is really

00:04:20.410 --> 00:04:22.740 
out so the lactobacillus is really
really<00:04:21.400> going<00:04:21.579> at<00:04:21.820> it<00:04:21.850> it's<00:04:22.420> probably<00:04:22.660> about

00:04:22.740 --> 00:04:22.750 
really going at it it's probably about

00:04:22.750 --> 00:04:24.360 
really going at it it's probably about
ninety<00:04:23.110> five<00:04:23.350> hundred<00:04:23.830> degrees<00:04:23.890> in<00:04:24.190> here

00:04:24.360 --> 00:04:24.370 
ninety five hundred degrees in here

00:04:24.370 --> 00:04:29.880 
ninety five hundred degrees in here
during<00:04:25.180> the<00:04:25.360> day<00:04:26.550> not<00:04:27.550> really<00:04:27.610> sure<00:04:28.890> what

00:04:29.880 --> 00:04:29.890 
during the day not really sure what

00:04:29.890 --> 00:04:32.640 
during the day not really sure what
temperature<00:04:30.280> is<00:04:30.400> it<00:04:30.430> is<00:04:30.970> at<00:04:31.120> night<00:04:31.650> gonna

00:04:32.640 --> 00:04:32.650 
temperature is it is at night gonna

00:04:32.650 --> 00:04:37.770 
temperature is it is at night gonna
guess<00:04:32.860> probably<00:04:33.780> eighty<00:04:34.780> degrees<00:04:36.600> not<00:04:37.600> sure

00:04:37.770 --> 00:04:37.780 
guess probably eighty degrees not sure

00:04:37.780 --> 00:04:39.150 
guess probably eighty degrees not sure
what<00:04:37.930> the<00:04:38.080> temperature<00:04:38.560> shift<00:04:38.770> is<00:04:38.950> going<00:04:39.100> to

00:04:39.150 --> 00:04:39.160 
what the temperature shift is going to

00:04:39.160 --> 00:04:41.820 
what the temperature shift is going to
do<00:04:39.310> to<00:04:39.490> the<00:04:40.030> lactobacillus<00:04:40.390> either<00:04:40.930> this

00:04:41.820 --> 00:04:41.830 
do to the lactobacillus either this

00:04:41.830 --> 00:04:43.430 
do to the lactobacillus either this
seems<00:04:42.070> to<00:04:42.160> be<00:04:42.190> having<00:04:42.520> a<00:04:42.610> really<00:04:42.880> healthy

cabbage<00:05:14.740> for<00:05:14.950> a<00:05:14.980> while<00:05:15.540> starting<00:05:16.540> to<00:05:16.630> smell<00:05:16.780> a

00:05:16.830 --> 00:05:16.840 
cabbage for a while starting to smell a

00:05:16.840 --> 00:05:19.710 
cabbage for a while starting to smell a
little<00:05:16.900> better<00:05:17.169> now<00:05:17.850> okay<00:05:18.850> so<00:05:18.910> I'm<00:05:19.330> just

00:05:19.710 --> 00:05:19.720 
little better now okay so I'm just

00:05:19.720 --> 00:05:22.710 
little better now okay so I'm just
rewriting<00:05:20.229> the<00:05:20.800> so5<00:05:21.490> yes<00:05:21.910> o5m<00:05:22.390> like<00:05:22.690> a

00:05:22.710 --> 00:05:22.720 
rewriting the so5 yes o5m like a

00:05:22.720 --> 00:05:26.400 
rewriting the so5 yes o5m like a
teaspoon<00:05:23.440> of<00:05:23.470> go<00:05:23.710> firm<00:05:25.050> it's<00:05:26.050> a<00:05:26.169> yeast

00:05:26.400 --> 00:05:26.410 
teaspoon of go firm it's a yeast

00:05:26.410 --> 00:05:31.130 
teaspoon of go firm it's a yeast
nutrient<00:05:26.979> from<00:05:27.330> rehydrating<00:05:28.330> the<00:05:28.479> yeast<00:05:29.130> the

00:05:31.130 --> 00:05:31.140 
nutrient from rehydrating the yeast the

00:05:31.140 --> 00:05:34.350 
nutrient from rehydrating the yeast the
beer<00:05:32.140> is<00:05:32.380> really<00:05:32.530> well<00:05:33.160> it's<00:05:33.430> probably<00:05:33.669> acidic

00:05:34.350 --> 00:05:34.360 
beer is really well it's probably acidic

00:05:34.360 --> 00:05:36.870 
beer is really well it's probably acidic
there's<00:05:34.900> less<00:05:35.680> co2<00:05:35.979> in<00:05:36.340> there<00:05:36.520> it's<00:05:36.640> a<00:05:36.669> harsh

00:05:36.870 --> 00:05:36.880 
there's less co2 in there it's a harsh

00:05:36.880 --> 00:05:39.060 
there's less co2 in there it's a harsh
environment<00:05:36.940> for<00:05:37.630> the<00:05:37.720> yeast<00:05:37.960> so<00:05:38.800> I<00:05:38.830> want<00:05:39.040> it

00:05:39.060 --> 00:05:39.070 
environment for the yeast so I want it

00:05:39.070 --> 00:05:41.430 
environment for the yeast so I want it
to<00:05:39.160> be<00:05:39.250> as<00:05:39.370> strong<00:05:39.640> as<00:05:39.880> possible<00:05:40.440> hopefully

00:05:41.430 --> 00:05:41.440 
to be as strong as possible hopefully

00:05:41.440 --> 00:05:44.100 
to be as strong as possible hopefully
this<00:05:41.800> go<00:05:42.070> firm<00:05:42.340> will<00:05:42.630> keep<00:05:43.630> the<00:05:43.780> yeast<00:05:43.960> as

00:05:44.100 --> 00:05:44.110 
this go firm will keep the yeast as

00:05:44.110 --> 00:05:45.719 
this go firm will keep the yeast as
strong<00:05:44.290> as<00:05:44.440> possible<00:05:44.800> so<00:05:44.890> I<00:05:44.950> can<00:05:44.979> firm<00:05:45.460> it<00:05:45.610> out

00:05:45.719 --> 00:05:45.729 
strong as possible so I can firm it out

00:05:45.729 --> 00:05:53.260 
strong as possible so I can firm it out
the<00:05:45.880> rest<00:05:46.090> of<00:05:46.270> the<00:05:47.910> beer

00:05:53.260 --> 00:05:53.270 

00:05:53.270 --> 00:05:55.390 

all<00:05:54.139> right<00:05:54.289> I'm<00:05:54.440> going<00:05:54.560> to<00:05:54.620> push<00:05:54.770> pitch<00:05:55.099> this

00:05:55.390 --> 00:05:55.400 
all right I'm going to push pitch this

00:05:55.400 --> 00:05:58.270 
all right I'm going to push pitch this
and<00:05:55.759> then<00:05:56.120> let<00:05:56.870> it<00:05:56.900> go<00:05:56.990> for<00:05:57.229> about<00:05:57.289> them<00:05:57.470> three

00:05:58.270 --> 00:05:58.280 
and then let it go for about them three

00:05:58.280 --> 00:06:00.490 
and then let it go for about them three
or<00:05:58.310> four<00:05:58.430> weeks<00:05:58.849> and<00:05:59.150> then<00:05:59.750> bottle<00:06:00.169> it<00:06:00.319> and

00:06:00.490 --> 00:06:00.500 
or four weeks and then bottle it and

00:06:00.500 --> 00:06:04.870 
or four weeks and then bottle it and
we'll<00:06:01.099> see<00:06:01.220> how<00:06:01.370> it<00:06:01.490> is<00:06:01.660> cheers<00:06:02.660> guys
