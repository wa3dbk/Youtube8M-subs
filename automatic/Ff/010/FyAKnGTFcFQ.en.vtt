00:00:10.310 --> 00:00:10.320 
hi my name is Christy I'm a scientist

00:00:10.320 --> 00:00:12.049 
hi my name is Christy I'm a scientist
with<00:00:10.530> affymetrix<00:00:11.160> and<00:00:11.370> today<00:00:11.670> I'm<00:00:11.790> here<00:00:12.000> to

00:00:12.049 --> 00:00:12.059 
with affymetrix and today I'm here to

00:00:12.059 --> 00:00:13.789 
with affymetrix and today I'm here to
show<00:00:12.210> you<00:00:12.389> how<00:00:12.630> to<00:00:12.690> optimize<00:00:13.230> your<00:00:13.259> sample

00:00:13.789 --> 00:00:13.799 
show you how to optimize your sample

00:00:13.799 --> 00:00:16.010

during<00:00:14.190> the<00:00:14.309> pretreatment<00:00:14.730> step<00:00:15.120> you<00:00:15.839> only

00:00:16.010 --> 00:00:16.020 
during the pretreatment step you only

00:00:16.020 --> 00:00:18.050 
during the pretreatment step you only
have<00:00:16.230> to<00:00:16.260> do<00:00:16.500> this<00:00:16.710> once<00:00:16.980> so<00:00:17.310> once<00:00:17.880> you've

00:00:18.050 --> 00:00:18.060 
have to do this once so once you've

00:00:18.060 --> 00:00:19.970 
have to do this once so once you've
