I really hate that you got this thing

00:01:11.130 --> 00:01:13.130 
I really hate that you got this thing
running<00:01:11.369> cuz<00:01:11.580> that's<00:01:12.150> just<00:01:12.180> gonna<00:01:12.420> take<00:01:12.659> SP

00:01:13.130 --> 00:01:13.140 
running cuz that's just gonna take SP

00:01:13.140 --> 00:01:15.380 
running cuz that's just gonna take SP
out<00:01:13.259> like<00:01:13.530> here<00:01:13.799> it<00:01:13.890> is<00:01:14.189> pointless<00:01:14.520> like<00:01:15.360> a

00:01:15.380 --> 00:01:15.390 
out like here it is pointless like a

00:01:15.390 --> 00:01:16.999 
out like here it is pointless like a
degree<00:01:15.960> will<00:01:16.079> faster<00:01:16.350> if<00:01:16.470> you<00:01:16.590> just<00:01:16.710> switch<00:01:16.979> it

00:01:16.999 --> 00:01:17.009 
degree will faster if you just switch it

00:01:17.009 --> 00:01:21.109 
degree will faster if you just switch it
with<00:01:17.280> fat<00:01:19.340> it<00:01:20.340> doesn't<00:01:20.430> really<00:01:20.759> go<00:01:20.850> that<00:01:21.000> fast

00:01:21.109 --> 00:01:21.119 
with fat it doesn't really go that fast

00:01:21.119 --> 00:01:22.880 
with fat it doesn't really go that fast
so<00:01:21.450> why<00:01:21.810> you<00:01:21.869> have<00:01:22.020> to<00:01:22.110> like<00:01:22.229> like<00:01:22.560> Jimin

00:01:22.880 --> 00:01:22.890 
so why you have to like like Jimin

00:01:22.890 --> 00:01:24.260 
so why you have to like like Jimin
become<00:01:23.100> bigger<00:01:23.340> I<00:01:23.490> just<00:01:23.700> gonna<00:01:23.880> take<00:01:24.000> ran<00:01:24.150> my

00:01:24.260 --> 00:01:24.270 
become bigger I just gonna take ran my

00:01:24.270 --> 00:01:27.560 
become bigger I just gonna take ran my
way<00:01:25.400> so<00:01:26.400> I<00:01:26.460> don't<00:01:26.579> really<00:01:26.700> like<00:01:26.880> this<00:01:27.060> Internet

00:01:27.560 --> 00:01:27.570
