00:00:11.959 --> 00:00:11.969 
think of a Japanese celebrity to meet to

00:00:11.969 --> 00:00:14.089 
think of a Japanese celebrity to meet to
help<00:00:12.120> us<00:00:12.330> you<00:00:12.900> know<00:00:12.929> with<00:00:13.110> our<00:00:13.139> research<00:00:13.590> yeah

00:00:14.089 --> 00:00:14.099 
help us you know with our research yeah

00:00:14.099 --> 00:00:17.570 
help us you know with our research yeah
into<00:00:14.849> our<00:00:14.910> robot<00:00:15.179> fight<00:00:15.650> for<00:00:16.650> me<00:00:16.800> this<00:00:17.400> is<00:00:17.550> a

00:00:17.570 --> 00:00:17.580 
into our robot fight for me this is a

00:00:17.580 --> 00:00:20.240 
into our robot fight for me this is a
life<00:00:17.849> box-ticking<00:00:18.450> moment<00:00:19.099> it's<00:00:20.099> just

00:00:20.240 --> 00:00:20.250 
life box-ticking moment it's just

00:00:20.250 --> 00:00:24.049 
life box-ticking moment it's just
incredibly<00:00:20.730> exciting<00:00:20.849> oh<00:00:22.070> my<00:00:23.070> goodness<00:00:23.790> there

00:00:24.049 --> 00:00:24.059 
incredibly exciting oh my goodness there

00:00:24.059 --> 00:00:24.589 
incredibly exciting oh my goodness there
he<00:00:24.149> is

00:00:24.589 --> 00:00:24.599 
he is

00:00:24.599 --> 00:00:26.810 
he is
we'd<00:00:24.809> managed<00:00:25.259> to<00:00:25.470> get<00:00:25.669> unprecedented<00:00:26.669> access

00:00:26.810 --> 00:00:26.820 
we'd managed to get unprecedented access

00:00:26.820 --> 00:00:30.260 
we'd managed to get unprecedented access
to<00:00:27.239> Honda's<00:00:27.869> brand-new<00:00:28.649> version<00:00:28.980> of<00:00:29.430> Azam<00:00:30.119> oh

00:00:30.260 --> 00:00:30.270 
to Honda's brand-new version of Azam oh

00:00:30.270 --> 00:00:33.500 
to Honda's brand-new version of Azam oh
this<00:00:30.689> is<00:00:30.840> incredible<00:00:31.610> it's<00:00:32.610> just<00:00:32.880> he's<00:00:33.300> like<00:00:33.480> a

00:00:33.500 --> 00:00:33.510 
this is incredible it's just he's like a

00:00:33.510 --> 00:00:35.090 
this is incredible it's just he's like a
hell<00:00:34.380> of<00:00:34.410> a<00:00:34.559> boy

00:00:35.090 --> 00:00:35.100 
hell of a boy

00:00:35.100 --> 00:00:38.990 
hell of a boy
it's<00:00:35.579> really<00:00:36.180> quite<00:00:36.629> strange<00:00:37.199> but<00:00:38.190> it<00:00:38.519> came<00:00:38.820> as

00:00:38.990 --> 00:00:39.000 
it's really quite strange but it came as

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:41.180 
it's really quite strange but it came as
a<00:00:39.120> price<00:00:39.420> we<00:00:40.050> were<00:00:40.199> only<00:00:40.410> allowed<00:00:40.620> to<00:00:40.920> film

00:00:41.180 --> 00:00:41.190 
a price we were only allowed to film

00:00:41.190 --> 00:00:43.250 
a price we were only allowed to film
when<00:00:41.399> they<00:00:41.579> said<00:00:41.910> so<00:00:42.179> and<00:00:42.480> we<00:00:42.749> couldn't<00:00:42.929> talk

00:00:43.250 --> 00:00:43.260 
when they said so and we couldn't talk

00:00:43.260 --> 00:00:46.130 
when they said so and we couldn't talk
or<00:00:43.499> interact<00:00:43.679> with<00:00:44.129> him<00:00:44.280> I<00:00:44.579> love<00:00:45.390> the<00:00:45.539> sideways

00:00:46.130 --> 00:00:46.140 
or interact with him I love the sideways

00:00:46.140 --> 00:00:51.169 
or interact with him I love the sideways
move<00:00:48.109> that's<00:00:49.109> cause<00:00:49.260> he<00:00:49.409> has<00:00:49.530> two<00:00:50.339> joints<00:00:50.969> and

00:00:51.169 --> 00:00:51.179 
move that's cause he has two joints and

00:00:51.179 --> 00:00:52.910 
move that's cause he has two joints and
hips<00:00:51.420> is<00:00:52.350> that<00:00:52.499> right

00:00:52.910 --> 00:00:52.920 
hips is that right

00:00:52.920 --> 00:00:55.970 
hips is that right
over<00:00:53.609> the<00:00:53.730> last<00:00:53.909> 30<00:00:54.329> years<00:00:54.929> ASIMO<00:00:55.440> has<00:00:55.589> evolved

00:00:55.970 --> 00:00:55.980 
over the last 30 years ASIMO has evolved

00:00:55.980 --> 00:00:57.979 
over the last 30 years ASIMO has evolved
from<00:00:56.100> a<00:00:56.249> simple<00:00:56.489> walking<00:00:56.879> machine<00:00:57.390> to<00:00:57.870> the

00:00:57.979 --> 00:00:57.989 
from a simple walking machine to the

00:00:57.989 --> 00:01:00.380 
from a simple walking machine to the
world's<00:00:58.409> most<00:00:58.559> advanced<00:00:59.159> humanoid<00:00:59.609> robot<00:01:00.149> and

00:01:00.380 --> 00:01:00.390 
world's most advanced humanoid robot and

00:01:00.390 --> 00:01:02.389 
world's most advanced humanoid robot and
he<00:01:00.690> has<00:01:00.780> a<00:01:00.809> whole<00:01:01.109> new<00:01:01.289> array<00:01:01.589> of<00:01:01.800> dynamic

00:01:02.389 --> 00:01:02.399 
he has a whole new array of dynamic

00:01:02.399 --> 00:01:04.189 
he has a whole new array of dynamic
movements<00:01:02.940> I<00:01:03.120> know<00:01:03.510> that<00:01:03.659> this<00:01:03.780> latest

00:01:04.189 --> 00:01:04.199 
movements I know that this latest

00:01:04.199 --> 00:01:08.180 
movements I know that this latest
version<00:01:04.650> as<00:01:05.300> 57<00:01:06.300> degrees<00:01:06.690> of<00:01:06.840> motion<00:01:06.990> so<00:01:07.470> 23

00:01:08.180 --> 00:01:08.190 
version as 57 degrees of motion so 23

00:01:08.190 --> 00:01:10.130 
version as 57 degrees of motion so 23
more<00:01:08.430> degrees<00:01:08.880> than<00:01:09.120> the<00:01:09.510> last<00:01:09.690> time<00:01:09.870> so<00:01:10.080> you

00:01:10.130 --> 00:01:10.140 
more degrees than the last time so you

00:01:10.140 --> 00:01:12.010 
more degrees than the last time so you
got<00:01:10.260> its<00:01:10.380> massive<00:01:10.830> exponential<00:01:11.370> Newton

00:01:12.010 --> 00:01:12.020 
got its massive exponential Newton

00:01:12.020 --> 00:01:14.720 
got its massive exponential Newton
mobility<00:01:13.020> and<00:01:13.410> it<00:01:13.560> was<00:01:13.680> this<00:01:13.860> expanded<00:01:14.520> range

00:01:14.720 --> 00:01:14.730 
mobility and it was this expanded range

00:01:14.730 --> 00:01:16.730 
mobility and it was this expanded range
of<00:01:14.880> motion<00:01:15.360> which<00:01:15.510> I<00:01:15.630> was<00:01:15.750> most<00:01:16.050> excited<00:01:16.260> about

00:01:16.730 --> 00:01:16.740 
of motion which I was most excited about

00:01:16.740 --> 00:01:19.220 
of motion which I was most excited about
and<00:01:17.400> as<00:01:17.520> mo<00:01:17.790> was<00:01:17.940> kind<00:01:18.240> enough<00:01:18.510> to<00:01:18.750> give<00:01:19.050> us<00:01:19.080> a

00:01:19.220 --> 00:01:19.230 
and as mo was kind enough to give us a

00:01:19.230 --> 00:01:28.480 
and as mo was kind enough to give us a
demo<00:01:19.500> of<00:01:19.830> some<00:01:20.160> of<00:01:20.280> his<00:01:20.370> new<00:01:20.580> moves

00:01:28.480 --> 00:01:28.490 

00:01:28.490 --> 00:01:31.490 

he<00:01:29.490> runs<00:01:29.730> up<00:01:29.910> to<00:01:30.060> nine<00:01:30.240> kilometres<00:01:30.840> an<00:01:30.960> hour

00:01:31.490 --> 00:01:31.500 
he runs up to nine kilometres an hour

00:01:31.500 --> 00:01:36.550 
he runs up to nine kilometres an hour
jumps<00:01:32.010> and<00:01:32.220> amazingly<00:01:33.030> can<00:01:33.360> help<00:01:33.600> Amen<00:01:34.020> foot

00:01:36.550 --> 00:01:36.560 

00:01:36.560 --> 00:01:39.350 

that<00:01:37.560> was<00:01:37.920> something<00:01:38.340> else<00:01:38.520> right<00:01:39.030> well<00:01:39.210> let's

00:01:39.350 --> 00:01:39.360 
that was something else right well let's

00:01:39.360 --> 00:01:53.660 
that was something else right well let's
see<00:01:39.570> how<00:01:39.900> impressive<00:01:40.200> his<00:01:40.410> party<00:01:40.680> trick<00:01:40.830> is<00:01:52.670> so

00:01:53.660 --> 00:01:53.670 
see how impressive his party trick is so

00:01:53.670 --> 00:01:55.040 
see how impressive his party trick is so
show<00:01:53.850> me<00:01:53.880> just<00:01:54.150> can't<00:01:54.330> be<00:01:54.420> the<00:01:54.510> jumper<00:01:54.869> thing

00:01:55.040 --> 00:01:55.050 
show me just can't be the jumper thing

00:01:55.050 --> 00:02:01.280 
show me just can't be the jumper thing
and<00:01:57.710> sayonara<00:01:58.710> Azam<00:01:59.520> oh<00:01:59.640> yeah<00:02:00.020> goodbye<00:02:01.020> my
