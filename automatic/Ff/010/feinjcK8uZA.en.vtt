00:02:14.730 --> 00:02:14.740 
and hit this flat spot if i'm not

00:02:14.740 --> 00:02:17.430 
and hit this flat spot if i'm not
mistaken<00:02:15.540> but<00:02:16.540> that<00:02:16.750> just<00:02:16.780> kind<00:02:17.110> of<00:02:17.140> gives<00:02:17.350> you

00:02:19.230 --> 00:02:19.240 
an idea that's some of the terrain that

00:02:19.240 --> 00:02:26.370 
an idea that's some of the terrain that
i'm<00:02:19.450> in<00:02:22.110> and<00:02:23.110> this<00:02:23.410> is<00:02:23.560> where<00:02:23.740> i<00:02:23.770> am<00:02:25.140> and<00:02:26.140> i'm

i'm in and this is where i am and i'm
heading<00:02:26.650> back<00:02:26.680> in<00:02:27.250> that<00:02:27.430> direction<00:02:28.860> as<00:02:29.860> a<00:02:29.920> good

00:02:30.120 --> 00:02:30.130 
heading back in that direction as a good

00:02:30.130 --> 00:02:36.360 
heading back in that direction as a good
hike<00:02:33.030> now<00:02:34.030> step<00:02:34.480> by<00:02:34.630> step<00:02:35.070> there's<00:02:36.070> a<00:02:36.190> cool

00:02:36.360 --> 00:02:36.370 
hike now step by step there's a cool

00:02:36.370 --> 00:02:42.270 
hike now step by step there's a cool
little<00:02:36.459> spot<00:02:39.090> like<00:02:40.090> these<00:02:40.270> ferns<00:02:41.070> up<00:02:42.070> here

00:02:42.270 --> 00:02:42.280 
little spot like these ferns up here

00:02:42.280 --> 00:02:46.160 
little spot like these ferns up here
against<00:02:42.520> the<00:02:42.670> rock<00:02:42.850> face<00:02:44.430> get<00:02:45.430> a<00:02:45.489> lot<00:02:45.610> of<00:02:45.640> shade

00:02:46.160 --> 00:02:46.170 
against the rock face get a lot of shade

00:02:46.170 --> 00:02:49.650 
against the rock face get a lot of shade
and<00:02:47.970> you<00:02:48.970> can<00:02:49.090> see<00:02:49.239> there's<00:02:49.390> a<00:02:49.450> lot<00:02:49.630> of

00:02:49.650 --> 00:02:49.660 
and you can see there's a lot of

00:02:49.660 --> 00:02:53.910 
and you can see there's a lot of
moisture<00:02:49.930> in<00:02:50.320> here<00:02:50.350> for<00:02:50.739> them<00:02:52.769> cool<00:02:53.769> little

00:02:53.910 --> 00:02:53.920 
moisture in here for them cool little

00:02:53.920 --> 00:03:09.700 
moisture in here for them cool little
spot<00:02:55.709> and<00:02:56.709> I'm<00:02:57.430> still<00:02:57.790> headed<00:02:58.260> that<00:02:59.260> direction

00:03:09.700 --> 00:03:09.710 

00:03:09.710 --> 00:03:18.820 

ah

00:03:18.820 --> 00:03:18.830 

00:03:18.830 --> 00:03:22.060 

here<00:03:19.490> is<00:03:19.760> an<00:03:20.060> example<00:03:20.150> of<00:03:20.750> the<00:03:21.020> reality<00:03:21.920> of<00:03:21.950> the

00:03:22.060 --> 00:03:22.070 
here is an example of the reality of the

00:03:22.070 --> 00:03:24.610 
here is an example of the reality of the
harshness<00:03:22.370> of<00:03:22.630> life<00:03:23.630> out<00:03:24.140> here<00:03:24.170> that<00:03:24.500> the

00:03:24.610 --> 00:03:24.620 
harshness of life out here that the

00:03:24.620 --> 00:03:27.190 
harshness of life out here that the
animals<00:03:25.010> go<00:03:25.160> through<00:03:25.660> you<00:03:26.660> see<00:03:26.840> there's<00:03:27.020> one

00:03:27.190 --> 00:03:27.200 
animals go through you see there's one

00:03:27.200 --> 00:03:30.370 
animals go through you see there's one
school<00:03:27.620> right<00:03:28.220> there<00:03:28.550> and<00:03:29.540> another<00:03:29.930> skull

00:03:30.370 --> 00:03:30.380 
school right there and another skull

00:03:30.380 --> 00:03:33.960 
school right there and another skull
right<00:03:30.620> there<00:03:31.360> so<00:03:32.360> my<00:03:32.660> guess<00:03:32.720> is<00:03:32.930> that<00:03:33.230> they<00:03:33.680> are

00:03:33.960 --> 00:03:33.970 
right there so my guess is that they are

00:03:33.970 --> 00:03:38.620 
right there so my guess is that they are
twin<00:03:34.970> fawns<00:03:35.530> were<00:03:36.530> twin<00:03:37.100> fawns<00:03:37.370> and<00:03:37.670> then<00:03:38.450> also

00:03:38.620 --> 00:03:38.630 
twin fawns were twin fawns and then also

00:03:38.630 --> 00:03:42.790 
twin fawns were twin fawns and then also
if<00:03:38.870> you<00:03:38.990> look<00:03:39.200> right<00:03:39.470> there<00:03:41.440> you<00:03:42.440> can<00:03:42.590> see<00:03:42.620> the

00:03:42.790 --> 00:03:42.800 
if you look right there you can see the

00:03:42.800 --> 00:03:45.130 
if you look right there you can see the
Huff<00:03:43.130> little<00:03:43.970> huff<00:03:44.150> this<00:03:44.450> gives<00:03:44.690> you<00:03:44.810> an<00:03:45.020> idea

00:03:45.130 --> 00:03:45.140 
Huff little huff this gives you an idea

00:03:45.140 --> 00:03:51.280 
Huff little huff this gives you an idea
sighs<00:03:45.710> my<00:03:45.920> finger<00:03:46.720> against<00:03:47.720> that<00:03:47.870> hook<00:03:50.290> this

00:03:51.280 --> 00:03:51.290 
sighs my finger against that hook this

00:03:51.290 --> 00:03:54.820 
sighs my finger against that hook this
is<00:03:51.500> actually<00:03:51.920> a<00:03:52.100> little<00:03:52.760> flat<00:03:53.120> spot<00:03:53.830> and

tricky thing about flat spots is you

00:04:13.459 --> 00:04:17.860 
tricky thing about flat spots is you
never<00:04:13.610> know<00:04:14.800> if<00:04:15.800> they're<00:04:16.100> really<00:04:16.250> flat<00:04:16.870> well

00:04:17.860 --> 00:04:17.870

I<00:04:38.419> don't<00:04:39.230> know<00:04:39.290> maybe<00:04:39.410> gotta<00:04:39.620> call<00:04:39.800> this<00:04:39.919> video

00:04:40.350 --> 00:04:40.360

judgment<00:04:41.360> calls<00:04:41.570> or<00:04:41.750> something<00:04:42.110> but<00:04:44.380> just<00:04:45.380> a

00:04:45.430 --> 00:04:45.440 
judgment calls or something but just a

00:04:45.440 --> 00:04:47.590 
judgment calls or something but just a
little<00:04:45.590> behind<00:04:45.800> the<00:04:46.010> scenes<00:04:46.330> when<00:04:47.330> you<00:04:47.419> see

00:04:47.590 --> 00:04:47.600 
little behind the scenes when you see

00:04:47.600 --> 00:04:49.990 
little behind the scenes when you see
what's<00:04:47.750> behind<00:04:47.930> me<00:04:48.290> and<00:04:48.800> I<00:04:49.580> could<00:04:49.760> probably

00:04:49.990 --> 00:04:50.000 
what's behind me and I could probably

00:04:50.000 --> 00:04:52.690 
what's behind me and I could probably
make<00:04:50.270> it<00:04:50.330> up<00:04:50.570> there<00:04:51.280> doing<00:04:52.280> a<00:04:52.340> couple<00:04:52.610> of

00:04:52.690 --> 00:04:52.700 
make it up there doing a couple of

00:04:52.700 --> 00:04:55.960 
make it up there doing a couple of
cutbacks<00:04:52.910> and<00:04:53.390> be<00:04:54.370> relatively<00:04:55.370> safe<00:04:55.640> about<00:04:55.910> it

00:04:55.960 --> 00:04:55.970 
cutbacks and be relatively safe about it

00:04:55.970 --> 00:04:58.330 
cutbacks and be relatively safe about it
but<00:04:56.810> I'm<00:04:56.900> going<00:04:57.020> to<00:04:57.080> call<00:04:57.260> this<00:04:57.530> and<00:04:57.830> so<00:04:58.220> I'm
