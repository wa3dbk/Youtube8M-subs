the complexity of the shape of the
hairline<00:00:12.420> that<00:00:13.259> is<00:00:13.380> very<00:00:13.650> different<00:00:14.099> from

00:00:14.360 --> 00:00:14.370 
hairline that is very different from

what you would do in a Caucasian female

00:00:16.080 --> 00:00:18.019 
what you would do in a Caucasian female
and<00:00:16.859> also<00:00:16.980> very<00:00:17.250> different<00:00:17.369> from<00:00:17.580> you<00:00:17.850> what

00:00:18.019 --> 00:00:18.029 
and also very different from you what

00:00:18.029 --> 00:00:20.810 
and also very different from you what
you<00:00:18.210> would<00:00:18.240> do<00:00:18.539> in<00:00:18.840> just<00:00:19.230> a<00:00:19.470> male<00:00:19.800> patient<00:00:20.310> as

00:00:20.810 --> 00:00:20.820 
you would do in just a male patient as

you would do in just a male patient as
you're<00:00:21.090> seeing<00:00:21.270> here<00:00:21.660> in<00:00:21.810> this<00:00:21.930> whole<00:00:22.080> portion

00:00:22.310 --> 00:00:22.320 
you're seeing here in this whole portion

00:00:22.320 --> 00:00:23.990 
you're seeing here in this whole portion
what<00:00:22.769> we're<00:00:22.920> following<00:00:23.130> is<00:00:23.460> almost<00:00:23.699> a<00:00:23.820> ghost

00:00:23.990 --> 00:00:24.000 
what we're following is almost a ghost

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:26.929 
what we're following is almost a ghost
tracing<00:00:24.630> of<00:00:24.779> our<00:00:25.320> existing<00:00:25.859> hairline<00:00:26.670> and

00:00:26.929 --> 00:00:26.939 
tracing of our existing hairline and

00:00:26.939 --> 00:00:28.910 
tracing of our existing hairline and
recreating<00:00:27.689> it<00:00:27.960> so<00:00:28.109> it's<00:00:28.260> much<00:00:28.410> stronger<00:00:28.769> you

00:00:28.910 --> 00:00:28.920 
recreating it so it's much stronger you

00:00:28.920 --> 00:00:30.320 
recreating it so it's much stronger you
can<00:00:28.980> see<00:00:29.130> there's<00:00:29.279> a<00:00:29.340> significant<00:00:29.910> loss<00:00:30.060> not

00:00:30.320 --> 00:00:30.330 
can see there's a significant loss not

00:00:30.330 --> 00:00:31.339 
can see there's a significant loss not
only<00:00:30.390> from<00:00:30.599> the<00:00:30.720> hairline<00:00:31.019> but<00:00:31.109> it<00:00:31.230> goes<00:00:31.320> all

00:00:31.339 --> 00:00:31.349 
only from the hairline but it goes all

00:00:31.349 --> 00:00:33.470 
only from the hairline but it goes all
the<00:00:31.470> way<00:00:31.529> back<00:00:31.590> into<00:00:31.949> the<00:00:32.070> temporal<00:00:32.460> area<00:00:32.730> then

00:00:33.470 --> 00:00:33.480 
the way back into the temporal area then

00:00:33.480 --> 00:00:35.840 
the way back into the temporal area then
into<00:00:33.840> the<00:00:34.020> central<00:00:34.590> portion<00:00:34.950> of<00:00:35.070> the<00:00:35.219> mid

00:00:35.840 --> 00:00:35.850 
into the central portion of the mid

00:00:35.850 --> 00:00:37.910 
into the central portion of the mid
scalp<00:00:36.149> as<00:00:36.329> well<00:00:36.360> we<00:00:37.200> recreate<00:00:37.620> all<00:00:37.739> these

00:00:37.910 --> 00:00:37.920 
scalp as well we recreate all these

00:00:37.920 --> 00:00:39.560 
scalp as well we recreate all these
sites<00:00:38.160> really<00:00:38.460> really<00:00:38.790> carefully<00:00:39.270> and<00:00:39.480> we're

00:00:39.560 --> 00:00:39.570 
sites really really carefully and we're

00:00:39.570 --> 00:00:40.580 
sites really really carefully and we're
going<00:00:39.690> to<00:00:39.719> talk<00:00:39.840> about<00:00:39.899> those<00:00:40.079> sites<00:00:40.320> just

00:00:40.580 --> 00:00:40.590 
going to talk about those sites just

00:00:40.590 --> 00:00:42.799 
going to talk about those sites just
more<00:00:40.800> in<00:00:40.860> a<00:00:40.920> moment<00:00:41.250> as<00:00:41.370> we<00:00:41.579> first<00:00:42.270> explore<00:00:42.690> the

00:00:42.799 --> 00:00:42.809 
more in a moment as we first explore the

00:00:42.809 --> 00:00:45.319 
more in a moment as we first explore the
hairline<00:00:43.140> design<00:00:43.730> this<00:00:44.730> perspective<00:00:45.210> you're

00:00:45.319 --> 00:00:45.329 
hairline design this perspective you're

00:00:45.329 --> 00:00:47.029 
hairline design this perspective you're
seeing<00:00:45.570> now<00:00:45.690> is<00:00:45.870> a<00:00:45.899> good<00:00:46.140> aerial<00:00:46.559> shot<00:00:46.800> of<00:00:46.950> the

00:00:47.029 --> 00:00:47.039 
seeing now is a good aerial shot of the

00:00:47.039 --> 00:00:48.260 
seeing now is a good aerial shot of the
entire<00:00:47.250> hairline<00:00:47.610> what<00:00:47.760> I<00:00:47.789> want<00:00:47.969> to<00:00:48.059> show<00:00:48.210> you

entire hairline what I want to show you
here<00:00:48.750> is<00:00:48.870> the<00:00:49.410> hairline<00:00:49.590> design<00:00:49.980> it<00:00:50.100> goes<00:00:50.219> up

00:00:50.389 --> 00:00:50.399 
here is the hairline design it goes up

00:00:50.399 --> 00:00:52.400 
here is the hairline design it goes up
this<00:00:50.579> way<00:00:50.789> there's<00:00:51.510> a<00:00:51.539> little<00:00:51.719> bit<00:00:51.809> arch<00:00:52.020> and<00:00:52.379> a

00:00:52.400 --> 00:00:52.410 
this way there's a little bit arch and a

00:00:52.410 --> 00:00:54.290 
this way there's a little bit arch and a
little<00:00:52.590> peak<00:00:52.829> back<00:00:53.309> in<00:00:53.550> this<00:00:53.640> direction<00:00:53.820> back

00:00:54.290 --> 00:00:54.300 
little peak back in this direction back

00:00:54.300 --> 00:00:54.920 
little peak back in this direction back
down<00:00:54.510> this<00:00:54.690> way

00:00:54.920 --> 00:00:54.930 
down this way

00:00:54.930 --> 00:00:56.750 
down this way
as<00:00:55.110> you<00:00:55.559> can<00:00:55.680> see<00:00:55.860> this<00:00:55.980> is<00:00:56.100> really<00:00:56.340> the<00:00:56.489> the

00:00:56.750 --> 00:00:56.760 
as you can see this is really the the

00:00:56.760 --> 00:00:58.910 
as you can see this is really the the
hair<00:00:57.239> that<00:00:57.360> you<00:00:57.420> had<00:00:57.690> mourn<00:00:58.020> youth<00:00:58.260> and<00:00:58.530> what

we're trying to do is really recreate a

00:01:00.510 --> 00:01:02.150 
we're trying to do is really recreate a
hairline<00:01:00.930> that<00:01:01.109> is<00:01:01.230> youthful<00:01:01.590> but<00:01:01.649> also<00:01:01.829> one

00:01:02.150 --> 00:01:02.160 
hairline that is youthful but also one

00:01:02.160 --> 00:01:04.549 
hairline that is youthful but also one
that<00:01:02.190> it<00:01:02.460> matches<00:01:02.640> where<00:01:03.480> she<00:01:03.750> is<00:01:03.840> in<00:01:04.199> her<00:01:04.379> age

00:01:04.549 --> 00:01:04.559 
that it matches where she is in her age

that it matches where she is in her age
right<00:01:04.830> now<00:01:04.860> to<00:01:05.309> make<00:01:05.460> sure<00:01:05.729> this<00:01:05.909> looks<00:01:06.090> really

00:01:06.770 --> 00:01:06.780 
right now to make sure this looks really

00:01:06.780 --> 00:01:08.740 
right now to make sure this looks really
really<00:01:06.900> appropriate<00:01:07.260> for<00:01:07.439> both<00:01:07.740> her

let's<00:01:11.159> go<00:01:11.250> ahead<00:01:11.340> and<00:01:11.520> do<00:01:11.640> some<00:01:11.820> analysis<00:01:12.240> of

00:01:12.440 --> 00:01:12.450 
let's go ahead and do some analysis of

00:01:12.450 --> 00:01:15.499 
let's go ahead and do some analysis of
the<00:01:12.630> actual<00:01:12.780> sites<00:01:13.200> same<00:01:14.189> same<00:01:14.520> way<00:01:14.850> that

00:01:15.499 --> 00:01:15.509 
the actual sites same same way that

00:01:15.509 --> 00:01:17.030 
the actual sites same same way that
we've<00:01:15.689> we've<00:01:15.960> done<00:01:16.170> other<00:01:16.350> sites<00:01:16.710> in<00:01:16.950> the

00:01:17.030 --> 00:01:17.040 
we've we've done other sites in the

00:01:17.040 --> 00:01:19.700 
we've we've done other sites in the
sense<00:01:17.310> that<00:01:17.400> they're<00:01:17.640> very<00:01:18.710> interlocked

00:01:19.700 --> 00:01:19.710 
sense that they're very interlocked

00:01:19.710 --> 00:01:21.800 
sense that they're very interlocked
pattern<00:01:20.280> that<00:01:20.610> goes<00:01:20.790> forward<00:01:21.150> so<00:01:21.540> that<00:01:21.689> there

00:01:21.800 --> 00:01:21.810 
pattern that goes forward so that there

00:01:21.810 --> 00:01:23.749 
pattern that goes forward so that there
isn't<00:01:21.960> a<00:01:22.080> see-through<00:01:22.470> effect<00:01:22.799> but<00:01:23.430> part<00:01:23.610> of<00:01:23.640> a

00:01:23.749 --> 00:01:23.759 
isn't a see-through effect but part of a

00:01:23.759 --> 00:01:25.070 
isn't a see-through effect but part of a
couple<00:01:24.030> things<00:01:24.119> we<00:01:24.360> want<00:01:24.509> to<00:01:24.570> take<00:01:24.930> into

00:01:25.070 --> 00:01:25.080 
couple things we want to take into

00:01:25.080 --> 00:01:26.240 
couple things we want to take into
consideration<00:01:25.140> and<00:01:25.770> one<00:01:25.890> is<00:01:25.979> that<00:01:26.100> these

00:01:26.240 --> 00:01:26.250 
consideration and one is that these

00:01:26.250 --> 00:01:29.569 
consideration and one is that these
sites<00:01:26.790> are<00:01:27.030> slightly<00:01:27.450> larger<00:01:28.290> than<00:01:28.770> the

00:01:29.569 --> 00:01:29.579 
sites are slightly larger than the

00:01:29.579 --> 00:01:31.460 
sites are slightly larger than the
Caucasian<00:01:29.939> sites<00:01:30.420> to<00:01:30.630> accommodate<00:01:31.049> the<00:01:31.170> curl

00:01:31.460 --> 00:01:31.470 
Caucasian sites to accommodate the curl

Caucasian sites to accommodate the curl
the<00:01:31.710> natural<00:01:32.009> curl<00:01:32.220> of<00:01:32.340> the<00:01:32.460> hair<00:01:32.700> also<00:01:33.630> the

00:01:33.740 --> 00:01:33.750 
the natural curl of the hair also the

00:01:33.750 --> 00:01:35.120 
the natural curl of the hair also the
way<00:01:33.900> that<00:01:33.930> I<00:01:34.140> created<00:01:34.470> these<00:01:34.590> sites<00:01:34.860> are

00:01:35.120 --> 00:01:35.130 
way that I created these sites are

00:01:35.130 --> 00:01:36.920 
way that I created these sites are
vertically<00:01:35.909> positioned<00:01:36.090> which<00:01:36.509> is<00:01:36.630> actually

00:01:36.920 --> 00:01:36.930 
vertically positioned which is actually

00:01:36.930 --> 00:01:38.359 
vertically positioned which is actually
the<00:01:37.020> exact<00:01:37.320> opposite<00:01:37.770> what<00:01:37.860> I<00:01:37.920> do<00:01:38.009> for

00:01:38.359 --> 00:01:38.369 
the exact opposite what I do for

00:01:38.369 --> 00:01:40.880 
the exact opposite what I do for
Caucasians<00:01:38.880> when<00:01:39.509> I<00:01:39.540> do<00:01:39.659> with<00:01:39.990> more<00:01:40.500> Asians

00:01:40.880 --> 00:01:40.890 
Caucasians when I do with more Asians

00:01:40.890 --> 00:01:43.039 
Caucasians when I do with more Asians
Caucasians<00:01:41.490> and<00:01:41.579> Asians<00:01:41.939> and<00:01:42.210> other<00:01:42.630> ethnic

00:01:43.039 --> 00:01:43.049 
Caucasians and Asians and other ethnic

00:01:43.049 --> 00:01:44.899 
Caucasians and Asians and other ethnic
hairs<00:01:43.320> that<00:01:43.530> have<00:01:43.590> straighter<00:01:43.950> hairs<00:01:44.250> need<00:01:44.820> to

00:01:44.899 --> 00:01:44.909 
hairs that have straighter hairs need to

00:01:44.909 --> 00:01:46.399 
hairs that have straighter hairs need to
be<00:01:45.000> angled<00:01:45.299> forward<00:01:45.630> so<00:01:45.990> that<00:01:46.140> they<00:01:46.229> don't

00:01:46.399 --> 00:01:46.409 
be angled forward so that they don't

00:01:46.409 --> 00:01:47.780 
be angled forward so that they don't
look<00:01:46.619> like<00:01:46.680> they're<00:01:47.009> pluggy<00:01:47.310> or<00:01:47.520> sticking

00:01:47.780 --> 00:01:47.790 
look like they're pluggy or sticking

00:01:47.790 --> 00:01:49.520 
look like they're pluggy or sticking
upward<00:01:48.210> this<00:01:48.899> is<00:01:49.079> actually<00:01:49.350> quite<00:01:49.500> the

00:01:49.520 --> 00:01:49.530 
upward this is actually quite the

00:01:49.530 --> 00:01:51.469 
upward this is actually quite the
opposite<00:01:49.979> if<00:01:50.130> I<00:01:50.280> went<00:01:50.549> down<00:01:50.850> with<00:01:50.880> this<00:01:51.270> would

00:01:51.469 --> 00:01:51.479 
opposite if I went down with this would

00:01:51.479 --> 00:01:53.359 
opposite if I went down with this would
actually<00:01:51.780> hurt<00:01:52.200> all<00:01:52.439> our<00:01:52.560> existing<00:01:52.979> hairs<00:01:53.189> and

00:01:53.359 --> 00:01:53.369 
actually hurt all our existing hairs and

00:01:53.369 --> 00:01:55.270 
actually hurt all our existing hairs and
it<00:01:53.430> wouldn't<00:01:53.610> grow<00:01:53.729> naturally<00:01:53.990> with

00:01:55.270 --> 00:01:55.280 
it wouldn't grow naturally with

00:01:55.280 --> 00:01:56.929 
it wouldn't grow naturally with
african-american<00:01:56.280> hair<00:01:56.369> I'm<00:01:56.520> actually<00:01:56.700> going

00:01:56.929 --> 00:01:56.939 
african-american hair I'm actually going

00:01:56.939 --> 00:01:58.700 
african-american hair I'm actually going
perpendicular<00:01:57.840> and<00:01:58.049> the<00:01:58.170> reason<00:01:58.469> that's<00:01:58.560> so

00:01:58.700 --> 00:01:58.710 
perpendicular and the reason that's so

00:01:58.710 --> 00:02:00.590 
perpendicular and the reason that's so
important<00:01:59.189> is<00:01:59.219> the<00:01:59.399> hair<00:01:59.610> comes<00:01:59.850> out<00:01:59.969> of<00:02:00.119> curls

00:02:00.590 --> 00:02:00.600 
important is the hair comes out of curls

00:02:00.600 --> 00:02:02.630 
important is the hair comes out of curls
and<00:02:00.810> that<00:02:01.409> curling<00:02:01.950> pattern<00:02:02.340> needs<00:02:02.490> to<00:02:02.549> be

00:02:02.630 --> 00:02:02.640 
and that curling pattern needs to be

00:02:02.640 --> 00:02:04.399 
and that curling pattern needs to be
respected<00:02:03.180> as<00:02:03.299> well<00:02:03.540> as<00:02:03.750> the<00:02:03.899> way<00:02:04.020> that<00:02:04.259> the

00:02:04.399 --> 00:02:04.409 
respected as well as the way that the

00:02:04.409 --> 00:02:06.440 
respected as well as the way that the
other<00:02:04.649> surrounding<00:02:05.040> hairs<00:02:05.369> are<00:02:05.520> not<00:02:05.549> hurt<00:02:05.909> so

00:02:06.440 --> 00:02:06.450 
other surrounding hairs are not hurt so

00:02:06.450 --> 00:02:08.270 
other surrounding hairs are not hurt so
that's<00:02:06.600> very<00:02:06.719> very<00:02:06.840> important<00:02:07.320> as<00:02:07.409> well<00:02:07.619> the

00:02:08.270 --> 00:02:08.280 
that's very very important as well the

00:02:08.280 --> 00:02:09.740 
that's very very important as well the
final<00:02:08.580> thing<00:02:08.700> to<00:02:08.729> consider<00:02:08.940> is<00:02:09.270> all<00:02:09.390> we<00:02:09.509> always

00:02:09.740 --> 00:02:09.750 
final thing to consider is all we always

00:02:09.750 --> 00:02:11.990 
final thing to consider is all we always
want<00:02:09.929> to<00:02:09.959> look<00:02:10.170> at<00:02:10.319> natural<00:02:10.500> density<00:02:11.310> so<00:02:11.790> I<00:02:11.819> go

00:02:11.990 --> 00:02:12.000 
want to look at natural density so I go

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:12.890 
want to look at natural density so I go
back<00:02:12.150> and<00:02:12.360> I<00:02:12.390> look<00:02:12.420> at<00:02:12.720> the

00:02:12.890 --> 00:02:12.900 
back and I look at the

00:02:12.900 --> 00:02:14.990 
back and I look at the
actual<00:02:13.170> density<00:02:13.319> and<00:02:13.920> this<00:02:14.040> hair<00:02:14.400> over<00:02:14.430> here

00:02:14.990 --> 00:02:15.000 
actual density and this hair over here

00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:16.640 
actual density and this hair over here
and<00:02:15.480> find<00:02:15.689> out<00:02:15.780> how<00:02:15.959> much<00:02:16.079> density<00:02:16.319> do<00:02:16.590> I

00:02:16.640 --> 00:02:16.650 
and find out how much density do I

00:02:16.650 --> 00:02:18.500 
and find out how much density do I
really<00:02:16.920> need<00:02:17.040> to<00:02:17.159> achieve<00:02:17.250> in<00:02:17.760> terms<00:02:18.360> of

00:02:18.500 --> 00:02:18.510 
really need to achieve in terms of

00:02:18.510 --> 00:02:19.940 
really need to achieve in terms of
spacing<00:02:18.780> date<00:02:19.110> to<00:02:19.260> achieve<00:02:19.590> this<00:02:19.769> and

00:02:19.940 --> 00:02:19.950 
spacing date to achieve this and

00:02:19.950 --> 00:02:21.170 
spacing date to achieve this and
actually<00:02:20.069> what<00:02:20.310> I<00:02:20.340> did<00:02:20.430> was<00:02:20.730> I<00:02:20.760> went<00:02:21.000> one

00:02:21.170 --> 00:02:21.180 
actually what I did was I went one

00:02:21.180 --> 00:02:23.270 
actually what I did was I went one
better<00:02:21.209> so<00:02:22.019> the<00:02:22.140> density<00:02:22.290> you're<00:02:22.590> seeing<00:02:22.860> here

00:02:23.270 --> 00:02:23.280 
better so the density you're seeing here

00:02:23.280 --> 00:02:25.369 
better so the density you're seeing here
is<00:02:23.430> reflective<00:02:24.239> the<00:02:24.360> density<00:02:24.689> you<00:02:24.750> see<00:02:24.959> here

00:02:25.369 --> 00:02:25.379 
is reflective the density you see here

00:02:25.379 --> 00:02:27.080 
is reflective the density you see here
in<00:02:25.530> terms<00:02:25.709> of<00:02:25.890> the<00:02:25.950> sites<00:02:26.220> but<00:02:26.819> I<00:02:26.849> want<00:02:27.060> a

00:02:27.080 --> 00:02:27.090 
in terms of the sites but I want a

00:02:27.090 --> 00:02:28.819 
in terms of the sites but I want a
little<00:02:27.239> bit<00:02:27.420> more<00:02:27.480> densely<00:02:28.049> here<00:02:28.379> so<00:02:28.530> you<00:02:28.680> have

00:02:28.819 --> 00:02:28.829 
little bit more densely here so you have

00:02:28.829 --> 00:02:30.110 
little bit more densely here so you have
even<00:02:28.950> a<00:02:29.099> better<00:02:29.280> result<00:02:29.640> than<00:02:29.760> what<00:02:29.970> you're

00:02:30.110 --> 00:02:30.120 
even a better result than what you're

00:02:30.120 --> 00:02:31.970 
even a better result than what you're
seeing<00:02:30.150> right<00:02:30.420> here<00:02:30.569> and<00:02:30.930> that's<00:02:31.079> that<00:02:31.739> should

00:02:31.970 --> 00:02:31.980 
seeing right here and that's that should

00:02:31.980 --> 00:02:34.250 
seeing right here and that's that should
be<00:02:32.099> really<00:02:32.670> really<00:02:32.849> excellent<00:02:33.060> as<00:02:33.239> we<00:02:33.390> follow

00:02:34.250 --> 00:02:34.260 
be really really excellent as we follow

00:02:34.260 --> 00:02:36.619 
be really really excellent as we follow
this<00:02:34.470> in<00:02:34.620> the<00:02:34.680> future<00:02:35.010> the<00:02:35.879> other<00:02:36.030> final<00:02:36.450> thing

00:02:36.619 --> 00:02:36.629 
this in the future the other final thing

00:02:36.629 --> 00:02:38.360 
this in the future the other final thing
is<00:02:36.780> important<00:02:37.290> is<00:02:37.379> that<00:02:37.409> when<00:02:37.680> you<00:02:37.769> look<00:02:37.920> at<00:02:38.159> an

00:02:38.360 --> 00:02:38.370 
is important is that when you look at an

00:02:38.370 --> 00:02:40.520 
is important is that when you look at an
african-american<00:02:38.730> hairline<00:02:39.390> the<00:02:40.079> eddies

00:02:40.520 --> 00:02:40.530 
african-american hairline the eddies

00:02:40.530 --> 00:02:41.809 
african-american hairline the eddies
that<00:02:40.680> we<00:02:40.769> talked<00:02:41.010> about<00:02:41.040> in<00:02:41.370> the<00:02:41.430> video<00:02:41.549> on

00:02:41.809 --> 00:02:41.819 
that we talked about in the video on

00:02:41.819 --> 00:02:43.309 
that we talked about in the video on
coastline<00:02:42.329> design<00:02:42.689> are<00:02:42.930> really<00:02:43.140> quite

00:02:43.309 --> 00:02:43.319 
coastline design are really quite

00:02:43.319 --> 00:02:44.390 
coastline design are really quite
different<00:02:43.560> from<00:02:43.769> what<00:02:43.950> you're<00:02:44.069> seeing<00:02:44.310> here

00:02:44.390 --> 00:02:44.400 
different from what you're seeing here

00:02:44.400 --> 00:02:46.940 
different from what you're seeing here
they're<00:02:44.879> much<00:02:45.180> tighter<00:02:45.569> they<00:02:45.840> don't<00:02:46.019> have<00:02:46.349> the

00:02:46.940 --> 00:02:46.950 
they're much tighter they don't have the

00:02:46.950 --> 00:02:49.190 
they're much tighter they don't have the
large<00:02:47.400> craggy<00:02:47.879> out<00:02:48.209> jetting<00:02:48.629> Xand<00:02:48.870> jetties

00:02:49.190 --> 00:02:49.200 
large craggy out jetting Xand jetties

00:02:49.200 --> 00:02:52.399 
large craggy out jetting Xand jetties
that<00:02:49.379> you<00:02:49.500> see<00:02:49.889> in<00:02:50.040> the<00:02:50.480> white<00:02:51.480> or<00:02:51.750> Asian<00:02:52.079> or

00:02:52.399 --> 00:02:52.409 
that you see in the white or Asian or

00:02:52.409 --> 00:02:55.069 
that you see in the white or Asian or
other<00:02:52.560> actually<00:02:53.069> types<00:02:53.340> of<00:02:53.569> hair<00:02:54.569> lines<00:02:54.810> and

00:02:55.069 --> 00:02:55.079 
other actually types of hair lines and

00:02:55.079 --> 00:02:57.979 
other actually types of hair lines and
so<00:02:55.200> you<00:02:55.260> I<00:02:55.680> keep<00:02:56.010> a<00:02:56.129> much<00:02:56.400> tighter<00:02:56.909> pattern<00:02:57.689> us

00:02:57.979 --> 00:02:57.989 
so you I keep a much tighter pattern us

00:02:57.989 --> 00:02:59.479 
so you I keep a much tighter pattern us
all<00:02:58.200> these<00:02:58.319> little<00:02:58.560> subtleties<00:02:58.980> make<00:02:59.189> a<00:02:59.220> big
