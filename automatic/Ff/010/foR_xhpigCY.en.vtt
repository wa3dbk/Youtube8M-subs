00:00:12.780 --> 00:00:17.340
 more satisfying than our 3,500 

00:00:15.480 --> 00:00:19.880

00:00:25.500 --> 00:00:29.970

00:01:06.670 --> 00:01:14.280
 the transition from bridge to Florence for 

00:01:11.560 --> 00:01:18.729
 the third time from off this marathon 

00:01:14.280 --> 00:01:21.010
 which was born in the wake of the great 

00:01:18.729 --> 00:01:23.890
 success of the cycling and world championships 

00:01:21.010 --> 00:01:25.960
 this enthusiasm that infects everyone 

00:01:23.890 --> 00:01:28.360
 of the passion of two wheels 

00:01:25.960 --> 00:01:31.240
 we are not just talking about competitive spirit but also 

00:01:28.360 --> 00:01:34.000
 of philosophy of the bicycle that for the 

00:01:31.240 --> 00:01:35.740
 the city of art the future is a 

00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:39.040
 extraordinary opportunity against 

00:01:35.740 --> 00:01:44.890
 pollution for health and for cities 

00:01:39.040 --> 00:01:46.450
 brothers then we start to climb the 

00:01:44.890 --> 00:01:48.700
 street is the one for fiesole and is a 

00:01:46.450 --> 00:01:50.890
 piece of the world circuit but the 

00:01:48.700 --> 00:01:52.990

 who have opted for the long one 

00:02:01.850 --> 00:02:06.650

00:02:20.520 --> 00:02:25.050
 downhill towards the landscape 

00:02:22.770 --> 00:02:26.640
