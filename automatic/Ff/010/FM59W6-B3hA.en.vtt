00:00:02.240 --> 00:00:06.460
 with the edge resistance and just stop to the rhythm is a characteristic 

00:00:06.460 --> 00:00:11.280
 important for the production systems of this crop both for the 

00:00:11.280 --> 00:00:14.909
 agribusiness and family farming ' 

00:00:14.909 --> 00:00:20.039
 generally the ideos manifests itself at a time when the plant begins to form 

00:00:20.039 --> 00:00:20.999
 the fruits 

00:00:20.999 --> 00:00:23.609
 the symptoms appear on the leaves 

00:00:23.609 --> 00:00:29.590
 of small spots resembling the chalk powder they evolve fulfilling all 

00:00:29.589 --> 00:00:33.250
 surface of the leaves leaving the pies lying and dry 

00:00:34.880 --> 00:00:37.990
 disease affects the production and quality of 

00:00:37.989 --> 00:00:39.480
 the fruits of watermelon 

00:00:39.480 --> 00:00:43.220
 which are less tasty and with less commercial value 

00:00:44.620 --> 00:00:49.300
 control of the fungus that causes this disease is done with the use of 

00:00:49.300 --> 00:00:52.300
 more expensive agrochemicals 

00:00:52.850 --> 00:00:58.380
 even with agrochemicals in the last 10 days before harvesting they should 

00:00:58.380 --> 00:01:01.860
 suspended according to the shortage of the products 

00:01:02.570 --> 00:01:07.510
 and it is precisely in this period that the disease strikes more strongly 

00:01:08.950 --> 00:01:11.950
 the producer can only make one policy 

00:01:12.940 --> 00:01:18.620
 the plantations with variety or to the sea reduction of the quantity of agrochemicals 

00:01:18.620 --> 00:01:19.980
 in consequence 

00:01:19.980 --> 00:01:21.550
 we decreased 

00:01:21.550 --> 00:01:24.750
 production and the risks of environmental contamination 

00:01:27.230 --> 00:01:33.670
 under these conditions the fruits harvested have healthier aspects and the 

00:01:33.670 --> 00:01:37.320
 crops acquire more sustainable characteristics 

00:01:38.230 --> 00:01:43.050
 the objective of the researchers who developed the watermelon or for it 

00:01:43.050 --> 00:01:48.920
 to provide farmers with a 

00:01:48.920 --> 00:01:52.220
 productive quality fruits 

00:01:52.220 --> 00:01:54.049
 well accepted by the market 

00:01:54.049 --> 00:01:57.670
 the consumer and is environmentally desirable 

00:01:58.400 --> 00:02:03.140
 with the large amount of genetic material deposited in the active 

00:02:03.140 --> 00:02:04.289
 germplasm 

00:02:04.289 --> 00:02:06.050
 of semiarid embrapa 

00:02:06.050 --> 00:02:10.980
 research should move forward to identify new yen with 

00:02:10.979 --> 00:02:14.020
 resistance to other diseases that attack the culture
