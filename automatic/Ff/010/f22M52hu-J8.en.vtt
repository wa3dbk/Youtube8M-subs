okay<00:01:14.229> this<00:01:14.560> is<00:01:14.710> the<00:01:14.830> trave<00:01:15.070> first<00:01:15.490> ring

00:01:15.950 --> 00:01:15.960 
okay this is the trave first ring

00:01:15.960 --> 00:01:19.200 
okay this is the trave first ring
victory<00:01:16.960> this<00:01:17.409> is<00:01:17.470> the<00:01:17.710> second<00:01:18.070> one<00:01:18.220> and<00:01:18.970> there

victory this is the second one and there
is<00:01:19.240> a<00:01:19.420> third<00:01:19.720> tray<00:01:19.990> which<00:01:20.170> I<00:01:20.290> haven't<00:01:20.650> used<00:01:20.950> in

00:01:21.330 --> 00:01:21.340 
is a third tray which I haven't used in

00:01:21.340 --> 00:01:24.990 
is a third tray which I haven't used in
LA<00:01:21.490> and<00:01:22.180> this<00:01:22.630> is<00:01:22.780> the<00:01:22.930> portal<00:01:23.229> one<00:01:23.820> this<00:01:24.820> is

LA and this is the portal one this is

00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:27.330 
LA and this is the portal one this is
pretty<00:01:25.180> good<00:01:25.479> just<00:01:26.350> leaves<00:01:26.920> your<00:01:27.070> things

00:01:27.330 --> 00:01:27.340 
pretty good just leaves your things

intact they don't move left or right and
this<00:01:30.850> is<00:01:31.000> your<00:01:31.210> chilla<00:01:32.970> okay<00:01:35.100> then<00:01:36.100> this<00:01:36.610> is

00:01:36.749 --> 00:01:36.759 
this is your chilla okay then this is

00:01:36.759 --> 00:01:39.230 
this is your chilla okay then this is
your<00:01:36.909> toughened<00:01:37.299> glass<00:01:37.360> was<00:01:37.990> first<00:01:38.590> one

00:01:39.230 --> 00:01:39.240 
your toughened glass was first one

00:01:39.240 --> 00:01:44.609 
your toughened glass was first one
second<00:01:40.240> one<00:01:40.420> and<00:01:40.960> third<00:01:41.380> one<00:01:41.970> and<00:01:43.320> right<00:01:44.320> now

00:01:44.609 --> 00:01:44.619 
second one and third one and right now

00:01:44.619 --> 00:01:49.130 
second one and third one and right now
it<00:01:44.830> is<00:01:45.009> on<00:01:45.220> the<00:01:45.990> first<00:01:46.990> level<00:01:47.289> as<00:01:47.560> you<00:01:47.860> can<00:01:48.039> see

00:01:49.130 --> 00:01:49.140 
it is on the first level as you can see

00:01:49.140 --> 00:01:52.649 
it is on the first level as you can see
that<00:01:50.140> is<00:01:50.319> the<00:01:50.440> first<00:01:50.710> level<00:01:50.950> and<00:01:51.280> it<00:01:52.179> is<00:01:52.210> having

00:01:52.649 --> 00:01:52.659 
that is the first level and it is having

00:01:52.659 --> 00:01:56.669 
that is the first level and it is having
a<00:01:52.840> pretty<00:01:52.990> cooling<00:01:54.990> got<00:01:55.990> cooling<00:01:56.380> you<00:01:56.500> could

00:01:56.669 --> 00:01:56.679 
a pretty cooling got cooling you could

00:01:56.679 --> 00:02:00.779 
a pretty cooling got cooling you could
say<00:01:57.450> similarly<00:01:58.450> if<00:01:58.600> you<00:01:58.750> this<00:01:59.289> is<00:01:59.409> the<00:01:59.789> turbo

00:02:00.779 --> 00:02:00.789 
say similarly if you this is the turbo

00:02:00.789 --> 00:02:04.830 
say similarly if you this is the turbo
boost<00:02:00.970> the<00:02:01.979> fridge<00:02:02.979> has<00:02:03.580> the<00:02:03.880> cooling<00:02:04.210> over

00:02:04.830 --> 00:02:04.840 
boost the fridge has the cooling over

00:02:04.840 --> 00:02:07.559 
boost the fridge has the cooling over
here<00:02:05.080> here<00:02:05.440> and<00:02:06.069> these<00:02:06.880> are<00:02:06.940> the<00:02:07.119> cooling

00:02:07.559 --> 00:02:07.569 
here here and these are the cooling

00:02:07.569 --> 00:02:10.559 
here here and these are the cooling
sections<00:02:07.929> and<00:02:08.140> even<00:02:08.890> at<00:02:09.069> this<00:02:09.310> level<00:02:09.519> this<00:02:10.509> is

00:02:10.559 --> 00:02:10.569 
sections and even at this level this is
