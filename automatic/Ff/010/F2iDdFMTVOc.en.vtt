it should help you next the training you

ups<00:01:11.310> work<00:01:11.520> your<00:01:11.729> arms<00:01:11.760> and<00:01:12.270> your<00:01:12.420> back<00:01:12.540> at<00:01:12.659> the

00:01:12.740 --> 00:01:12.750 
ups work your arms and your back at the

00:01:12.750 --> 00:01:14.840 
ups work your arms and your back at the
same<00:01:12.869> time<00:01:13.049> it's<00:01:13.560> much<00:01:13.710> harder<00:01:13.979> technically

00:01:14.840 --> 00:01:14.850 
same time it's much harder technically

00:01:14.850 --> 00:01:17.420 
same time it's much harder technically
speaking<00:01:14.909> you<00:01:15.540> you<00:01:16.080> activate<00:01:16.710> more<00:01:16.950> muscle

00:01:17.420 --> 00:01:17.430 
speaking you you activate more muscle

00:01:17.430 --> 00:01:19.609 
speaking you you activate more muscle
fibers<00:01:17.820> so<00:01:18.330> they<00:01:18.509> break<00:01:18.750> down<00:01:18.780> and<00:01:19.290> they<00:01:19.380> build

00:01:19.609 --> 00:01:19.619 
fibers so they break down and they build

00:01:19.619 --> 00:01:23.270 
fibers so they break down and they build
up<00:01:19.740> stronger<00:01:20.280> and<00:01:20.610> harder<00:01:21.350> so<00:01:22.350> do<00:01:22.860> compound

00:01:23.270 --> 00:01:23.280 
up stronger and harder so do compound

00:01:23.280 --> 00:01:27.620 
up stronger and harder so do compound
lifting<00:01:23.640> also<00:01:24.479> look<00:01:25.439> at<00:01:25.560> your<00:01:25.740> rep<00:01:26.340> range<00:01:26.640> if

00:01:27.620 --> 00:01:27.630 
lifting also look at your rep range if

00:01:27.630 --> 00:01:29.690 
lifting also look at your rep range if
you're<00:01:27.869> doing<00:01:28.140> reps<00:01:28.409> I've<00:01:28.799> around<00:01:29.040> about<00:01:29.250> 20

00:01:29.690 --> 00:01:29.700 
you're doing reps I've around about 20

00:01:29.700 --> 00:01:31.429 
you're doing reps I've around about 20
or<00:01:29.790> 30<00:01:29.970> reps<00:01:30.180> it's<00:01:30.630> endurance<00:01:31.079> you're<00:01:31.290> not

00:01:31.429 --> 00:01:31.439 
or 30 reps it's endurance you're not

00:01:31.439 --> 00:01:32.480 
or 30 reps it's endurance you're not
actually<00:01:31.560> going<00:01:31.770> to<00:01:31.860> get<00:01:31.979> bigger<00:01:32.189> and

00:01:32.480 --> 00:01:32.490 
actually going to get bigger and

00:01:32.490 --> 00:01:34.580 
actually going to get bigger and
stronger<00:01:32.759> you<00:01:33.450> need<00:01:33.630> to<00:01:33.750> actually<00:01:33.900> have<00:01:34.200> less

00:01:34.580 --> 00:01:34.590 
stronger you need to actually have less

00:01:34.590 --> 00:01:36.440 
stronger you need to actually have less
reps<00:01:34.920> go<00:01:35.369> get<00:01:35.579> a<00:01:35.610> weight<00:01:35.909> which<00:01:36.090> is<00:01:36.119> heavy

00:01:36.440 --> 00:01:36.450 
reps go get a weight which is heavy

00:01:36.450 --> 00:01:37.999 
reps go get a weight which is heavy
enough<00:01:36.540> that<00:01:36.990> you<00:01:37.049> can<00:01:37.140> only<00:01:37.320> do<00:01:37.590> it<00:01:37.619> round

00:01:37.999 --> 00:01:38.009 
enough that you can only do it round

00:01:38.009 --> 00:01:40.580 
enough that you can only do it round
about<00:01:38.159> eight<00:01:38.759> nine<00:01:38.820> ten<00:01:39.600> times<00:01:39.869> maximum<00:01:40.320> and

00:01:40.580 --> 00:01:40.590 
about eight nine ten times maximum and

00:01:40.590 --> 00:01:43.550 
about eight nine ten times maximum and
finally<00:01:41.250> split<00:01:41.700> your<00:01:41.820> body<00:01:42.030> parts<00:01:42.360> are<00:01:42.509> so<00:01:43.049> one

00:01:43.550 --> 00:01:43.560 
finally split your body parts are so one

00:01:43.560 --> 00:01:45.440 
finally split your body parts are so one
day<00:01:43.710> to<00:01:43.770> upper<00:01:44.100> body<00:01:44.280> next<00:01:44.850> I<00:01:44.939> do<00:01:45.060> lower<00:01:45.210> body

00:01:45.440 --> 00:01:45.450 
day to upper body next I do lower body
