00:00:01.840 --> 00:00:06.970
 hello youtube people this is my first 

00:00:04.720 --> 00:00:09.070
 it's good to have two accounts 

00:00:06.970 --> 00:00:11.320
 they were open from the same pc 

00:00:09.070 --> 00:00:14.080
 first we go to our browser and 

00:00:11.320 --> 00:00:17.970
 go to the official website of the Santurce 

00:00:14.080 --> 00:00:17.970
 I'll leave in the description of the video 

00:00:34.480 --> 00:00:39.250
 and as you can see there are several versions and 

00:00:37.030 --> 00:00:42.120
 we will choose the trial version because 

00:00:39.250 --> 00:00:42.120
 It works very well 

00:00:45.290 --> 00:00:50.270
 and you can see an image of how it is 

00:00:47.870 --> 00:00:52.610
 the application interface we chose 

00:00:50.270 --> 00:00:55.000
 download from the site and start 

00:00:52.610 --> 00:00:55.000
 to download 

00:01:00.350 --> 00:01:05.150
 now we indicate the file where they have 

00:01:02.870 --> 00:01:07.490
 the downloads in my case I have it in the 

00:01:05.150 --> 00:01:09.619
 desktop we execute it choose the 

00:01:07.490 --> 00:01:11.810
 language of your preference in my case in 

00:01:09.619 --> 00:01:13.880
 Spanish have to choose the route where 

00:01:11.810 --> 00:01:16.310
 they want the file saved in my 

00:01:13.880 --> 00:01:18.920
 case on the local disk of give you start 

00:01:16.310 --> 00:01:21.820
 the following following 

00:01:18.920 --> 00:01:21.820
 following 

00:01:32.450 --> 00:01:37.310
 the application will start ignore 

00:01:35.299 --> 00:01:39.469
 of these I recommend that you believe in a 

00:01:37.310 --> 00:01:41.360
 santa foxistas 30 days since the 

00:01:39.469 --> 00:01:43.039
 application creates errors we create it 

00:01:41.360 --> 00:01:45.799
 we were editing box and when creating 

00:01:43.039 --> 00:01:50.380
 new unboxing we put a name 

00:01:45.799 --> 00:01:50.380
 I recommend numbers and default we accept 

00:01:57.060 --> 00:02:01.560
 and now we create we go again in 

00:01:59.460 --> 00:02:04.020
 holy boxer since we create execute 

00:02:01.560 --> 00:02:07.009
 isolated run windows explorer 

00:02:04.020 --> 00:02:07.009
 we accept 

00:02:16.770 --> 00:02:22.380
 we will be able to use the application 

00:02:19.290 --> 00:02:27.260
 We seek the executable local disk 

00:02:22.380 --> 00:02:27.260
 program files this extra point 

00:02:35.920 --> 00:02:41.819
 we started it and we achieved our second 

00:02:38.740 --> 00:02:41.819
 this year's account 

00:03:05.870 --> 00:03:10.610
 equal to already started our second 

00:03:09.230 --> 00:03:14.650
 this year's account 

00:03:10.610 --> 00:03:14.650
 we minimize or close the application 

00:03:23.440 --> 00:03:27.790
 and as you will see that if it works at 

00:03:25.810 --> 00:03:30.190
 left in the first account and its 

00:03:27.790 --> 00:03:32.860
 right the second account and so they can 

00:03:30.190 --> 00:03:35.260
 go to those items of dota 2 games 

00:03:32.860 --> 00:03:37.840
 among other things, good if it served them
