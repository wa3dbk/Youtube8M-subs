 here in the West the whole truth does not 

00:00:42.680 --> 00:00:46.760
 no sense because what we had was 

00:00:44.360 --> 00:00:48.440

 committed all the things that 

00:01:11.750 --> 00:01:14.890
 happened during the war 

00:01:15.890 --> 00:01:21.259
 so more powerful it detailed the people 

00:01:18.380 --> 00:01:25.910

00:01:21.259 --> 00:01:27.649

 had a deadly fighting technique that 

00:01:32.570 --> 00:01:36.950
 will eliminate almost all enemies and was 

00:01:34.940 --> 00:01:38.929
 a cornerstone for the 

00:01:36.950 --> 00:01:41.539
 monarchists win continues to eliminate 

00:01:38.929 --> 00:01:44.000
 people who were 

00:01:41.539 --> 00:01:45.590
 against the monarchists and against 

00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:47.209
 history are people you had 

00:01:45.590 --> 00:01:49.009
 based on a real samurai who lived 

00:01:47.209 --> 00:01:52.310
 in this war that went well in the bag cami 

00:01:49.009 --> 00:01:53.569
 that was the face dictatorship low appearance 

00:01:52.310 --> 00:01:55.369
 fragile it could be easily 

00:01:53.569 --> 00:01:56.869
 confused with a woman he was 

00:01:55.369 --> 00:01:58.700
 calm serene 

00:01:56.869 --> 00:02:01.580
 only that in fact he was one of the greatest 

00:01:58.700 --> 00:02:02.929
 directors of this war a cold and 

00:02:01.580 --> 00:02:06.920
 cruel to murder the enemies 

00:02:02.929 --> 00:02:08.630
 were not worth anything and so 

00:02:06.920 --> 00:02:10.369
 when he returns to Tokyo the way 

00:02:08.630 --> 00:02:12.560
 he crosses with gold dacal with my 

00:02:10.369 --> 00:02:14.150
 style master my box and 

00:02:12.560 --> 00:02:15.830
 ends up helping to unravel the case of a 

00:02:14.150 --> 00:02:17.660
 swordsman who claimed to be the actor leaves 

00:02:15.830 --> 00:02:19.790
 machine gun was demoralizing the 

00:02:17.660 --> 00:02:22.819
 her style and so begins the 

00:02:19.790 --> 00:02:24.190
 ruhr history nikki shindo that 

00:02:22.819 --> 00:02:26.660
 baffle co 

00:02:24.190 --> 00:02:29.060
 nobody had a cat in all those 

00:02:26.660 --> 00:02:31.250
 manga that I do not know that I 

00:02:29.060 --> 00:02:32.630
 I understand, I really understand who was a 

00:02:31.250 --> 00:02:35.239
 little to be a little afraid of 

00:02:32.630 --> 00:02:36.920
 veronica on chip that really he is a 

00:02:35.239 --> 00:02:39.380
 very traditional place and was published 

00:02:36.920 --> 00:02:41.450
 by China and India in 94 lasted five 

00:02:39.380 --> 00:02:42.450
 years and a half and had 28 issues 

00:02:41.450 --> 00:02:44.400
 bound 

00:02:42.450 --> 00:02:46.200
 only in fact despite it being for 

00:02:44.400 --> 00:02:48.720
 this more teen audience he has 

00:02:46.200 --> 00:02:50.099
 that manga peek them and is 

00:02:48.720 --> 00:02:53.250
 ends up messing up a little childish 

00:02:50.099 --> 00:02:55.470
 sometimes the story is the truth 

00:02:53.250 --> 00:02:56.670
 line to be based on actual fact but not 

00:02:55.470 --> 00:02:58.440
 historical fact 

00:02:56.670 --> 00:03:00.120
 she has many moments dealing with 

00:02:58.440 --> 00:03:03.630
 serious matters that had a full face 

00:03:00.120 --> 00:03:06.269
 of guilt a guy who tries to cleanse and 

00:03:03.630 --> 00:03:08.489
 clean his past tries to clean it up 

00:03:06.269 --> 00:03:10.110
 not to undo what happened but 

00:03:08.489 --> 00:03:12.180
 simply find a way from it 

00:03:10.110 --> 00:03:13.980
 and excuse the way he 

00:03:12.180 --> 00:03:15.989
 can make up for everything bad that 

00:03:13.980 --> 00:03:17.670
 ended up causing so many people to so many 

00:03:15.989 --> 00:03:19.049
 people who ended up killing in this war 

00:03:17.670 --> 00:03:21.840
 and there are a lot of people from the war period 

00:03:19.049 --> 00:03:23.970
 to appear in his life in the 

00:03:21.840 --> 00:03:26.130
 truth every series is punctuated by this 

00:03:23.970 --> 00:03:28.650
 old enemies or people who have ended up 

00:03:26.130 --> 00:03:31.319
 being harmed by kenshin or 

00:03:28.650 --> 00:03:32.940
 allies that today even the samurai who 

00:03:31.319 --> 00:03:34.170
 today they are by big government figures and 

00:03:32.940 --> 00:03:36.000
 want you to remember that the government also 

00:03:34.170 --> 00:03:38.190
 that he was a key player in this 

00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:39.930
 war then the series 

00:03:38.190 --> 00:03:41.880
 despite having sealed but only this 

00:03:39.930 --> 00:03:44.519
 Lighter side also has this side 

00:03:41.880 --> 00:03:46.290
 more serious where even speak inside 

00:03:44.519 --> 00:03:49.950
 character that talks about the issue of 

00:03:46.290 --> 00:03:51.690
 spirit of belief of all the ideals of 

00:03:49.950 --> 00:03:54.060
 life and all that all things that 

00:03:51.690 --> 00:03:55.859
 move you to move on 

00:03:54.060 --> 00:03:58.579
 so it ends up burning is very rich and 

00:03:55.859 --> 00:04:01.350
 There's also a fight for fuck and fights. 

00:03:58.579 --> 00:04:03.720
 sensational that part of you 

00:04:01.350 --> 00:04:06.569
 to be a focused teen manga 

00:04:03.720 --> 00:04:08.370
 It's very cool. They're not a new one. 

00:04:06.569 --> 00:04:10.170
 fight that samurai has real with you 

00:04:08.370 --> 00:04:13.470
 will see the vagabond monkey that is a 

00:04:10.170 --> 00:04:15.299
 thing a little more adult same but are 

00:04:13.470 --> 00:04:17.130
 fights for full of special effects and 

00:04:15.299 --> 00:04:19.079
 jumps one thing halfway the matrix 

00:04:17.130 --> 00:04:21.889
 Sometimes it's very cool. 

00:04:19.079 --> 00:04:21.889
 exciting 

00:04:22.909 --> 00:04:30.870
 that is the only one being made the 

00:04:26.699 --> 00:04:33.930
 that the iphan of the manga published in 94 in the 

00:04:30.870 --> 00:04:35.849
 up to 99 years lasted five and a half years. 

00:04:33.930 --> 00:04:37.560
 publication but here in Brazil it was 

00:04:35.849 --> 00:04:39.990
 published in the news medium changed good 

00:04:37.560 --> 00:04:41.849
 which consists of two sections half a 

00:04:39.990 --> 00:04:43.680
 Japanese edition that the Japanese usually 

00:04:41.849 --> 00:04:46.050
 two of the parenchyma around 200 

00:04:43.680 --> 00:04:47.430
 pages in ten chapters in the case and here 

00:04:46.050 --> 00:04:50.039
 Brazil has decided to publish in two 

00:04:47.430 --> 00:04:52.530
 smaller editions every fortnight each 

00:04:50.039 --> 00:04:54.990
 of 2 90 is long time who remember right 

00:04:52.530 --> 00:04:57.629

00:04:54.990 --> 00:04:59.940
 manga published by jvc relaunch 

00:04:57.629 --> 00:05:01.289
 that she just left and now they 

00:04:59.940 --> 00:05:03.509
 they are as I said by joining the 

00:05:01.289 --> 00:05:05.759
 200-page Japanese format 

00:05:03.509 --> 00:05:07.710
 is no longer the thin version and with a 

00:05:05.759 --> 00:05:10.229
 Also new cover are using title 

00:05:07.710 --> 00:05:14.550
 original that roni that at last not samurai 

00:05:10.229 --> 00:05:16.500
 x is serious and has a super role here 

00:05:14.550 --> 00:05:18.659
 Nice that in offset is not more that it has 

00:05:16.500 --> 00:05:20.789
 scrotum newsprint then you buy 

00:05:18.659 --> 00:05:25.340
 You have to save even if you 

00:05:20.789 --> 00:05:28.080
 retraction of terms of things is more 

00:05:25.340 --> 00:05:29.819
 that way in relation to Japan and not 

00:05:28.080 --> 00:05:32.099
 in relation to the anime tradition as 

00:05:29.819 --> 00:05:34.229
 followed the first the first manga and is 

00:05:32.099 --> 00:05:36.210
 Very cool, man. I recommend it. 

00:05:34.229 --> 00:05:38.550
 Tag Fight 

00:05:36.210 --> 00:05:40.650
 This is the time for you to find out where 

00:05:38.550 --> 00:05:42.990
 anyway a lot of people had an animated series 

00:05:40.650 --> 00:05:45.509
 of 94 episodes that was shown here in 

00:05:42.990 --> 00:05:48.090
 globe and 99 totally shredded 

00:05:45.509 --> 00:05:49.949
 totally edited a stupid thing of the 

00:05:48.090 --> 00:05:52.169
 Fucking balloon going through a series of fights 

00:05:49.949 --> 00:05:54.479
 who has sword has blood from morning to 

00:05:52.169 --> 00:05:57.199
 same intelligence of displaying simpsons of 

00:05:54.479 --> 00:05:57.199
 morning but with time 

00:06:00.610 --> 00:06:07.490

00:06:04.370 --> 00:06:09.080
 with actors and was very well received 

00:06:07.490 --> 00:06:11.420
 by critics had more than one million 

00:06:09.080 --> 00:06:13.700
 viewers in japan will give sequence 

00:06:11.420 --> 00:06:15.380
 and that it was all very nice for all three 

00:06:13.700 --> 00:06:17.420
 appeared very promising 

00:06:15.380 --> 00:06:19.790
 so it has a lot of content 

00:06:17.420 --> 00:06:22.520
 Whatever I hope you have if you 

00:06:19.790 --> 00:06:24.410

00:06:35.840 --> 00:06:42.170
