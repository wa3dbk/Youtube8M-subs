I'm going to give it a try and see how

00:03:34.590 --> 00:03:35.990 
I'm going to give it a try and see how
it<00:03:34.739> tastes<00:03:34.979> I've<00:03:35.220> added<00:03:35.370> a<00:03:35.609> little<00:03:35.790> bit<00:03:35.879> of

00:03:35.990 --> 00:03:36.000 
it tastes I've added a little bit of

00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:38.979 
it tastes I've added a little bit of
cool<00:03:36.299> whip<00:03:36.479> on<00:03:36.720> top<00:03:37.049> so<00:03:37.620> it's<00:03:37.829> not<00:03:37.979> exactly

00:03:38.979 --> 00:03:38.989 
cool whip on top so it's not exactly

00:03:38.989 --> 00:03:41.479 
cool whip on top so it's not exactly
lactose<00:03:39.989> free<00:03:40.019> but<00:03:40.650> I<00:03:40.829> wouldn't<00:03:41.159> serve<00:03:41.340> it

00:03:41.479 --> 00:03:41.489 
lactose free but I wouldn't serve it

00:03:41.489 --> 00:03:49.470 
lactose free but I wouldn't serve it
with<00:03:41.579> glue<00:03:41.849> it<00:03:42.000> for<00:03:42.269> my<00:03:42.419> son<00:03:42.720> so

00:03:49.470 --> 00:03:49.480 

00:03:49.480 --> 00:03:52.030 

in<00:03:50.480> my<00:03:50.689> opinion<00:03:50.959> it<00:03:51.290> tastes<00:03:51.530> just<00:03:51.650> like

00:03:52.030 --> 00:03:52.040 
in my opinion it tastes just like

00:03:52.040 --> 00:03:55.059 
in my opinion it tastes just like
regular<00:03:52.930> chocolate<00:03:53.930> pudding<00:03:54.349> maybe<00:03:54.769> a<00:03:54.890> little

00:03:55.059 --> 00:03:55.069 
regular chocolate pudding maybe a little

00:03:55.069 --> 00:03:57.850 
regular chocolate pudding maybe a little
bit<00:03:55.220> better<00:03:55.370> than<00:03:55.730> this<00:03:55.939> instant<00:03:56.540> stuff<00:03:56.860> but

00:03:57.850 --> 00:03:57.860 
bit better than this instant stuff but

00:03:57.860 --> 00:04:00.489 
bit better than this instant stuff but
it's<00:03:57.950> actually<00:03:58.069> quite<00:03:58.370> good
