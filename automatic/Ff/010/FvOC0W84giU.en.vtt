00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.670
 Hi everyone, this morning I am 

00:00:03.510 --> 00:00:08.580
 glad because a video finally comes around 

00:00:05.670 --> 00:00:11.250
 it's a lot for a ride though this morning 

00:00:08.580 --> 00:00:15.809
 he's a little better and so I've decided 

00:00:11.250 --> 00:00:17.940
 in short, to shoot and I wanted to do one 

00:00:15.809 --> 00:00:20.850
 small all about some things I have 

00:00:17.940 --> 00:00:23.609
 bought some time ago 

00:00:20.850 --> 00:00:26.189
 and since I had not had the opportunity to do 

00:00:23.609 --> 00:00:27.990
 veil to show you these things 

00:00:26.189 --> 00:00:32.219
 let's do most of it today 

00:00:27.990 --> 00:00:34.200
 they are things of essence and are not of the 

00:00:32.219 --> 00:00:36.059
 new collection because when there are 

00:00:34.200 --> 00:00:37.530
 unfortunately there was no cabbage 

00:00:36.059 --> 00:00:39.420
 still hadn't come out yet 

00:00:37.530 --> 00:00:41.640
 it had to be out but they didn't have it 

00:00:39.420 --> 00:00:42.899
 still the stands ready 

00:00:41.640 --> 00:00:44.579
 even if they had at the store 

00:00:42.899 --> 00:00:48.140
 sincerely that the new one should come out 

00:00:44.579 --> 00:00:50.340
 collection like but apart from that e 

00:00:48.140 --> 00:00:52.890
 so they are still products that 

00:00:50.340 --> 00:00:56.370
 still found then started immediately 

00:00:52.890 --> 00:00:58.350
 without getting lost in talk 

00:00:56.370 --> 00:01:00.390
 I took these three patrols that lasting 

00:00:58.350 --> 00:01:02.699
 they are of three colors according to me one more 

00:01:00.390 --> 00:01:05.430
 nice of another and I took this 

00:01:02.699 --> 00:01:10.290
 silver gray metallic 

00:01:05.430 --> 00:01:12.630
 this is 0 5 if i took this for you 

00:01:10.290 --> 00:01:16.460
 emerald green also this is beautiful 

00:01:12.630 --> 00:01:20.729
 this is the number 12 ae have a dream 

00:01:16.460 --> 00:01:23.820
 and then this gilded bronze which is the 

00:01:20.729 --> 00:01:25.920
 number 15 is called big thing is a 

00:01:23.820 --> 00:01:28.770
 I think all three are beautiful 

00:01:25.920 --> 00:01:30.170
 then I still didn't approve these 

00:01:28.770 --> 00:01:32.880
 products 

00:01:30.170 --> 00:01:34.979
 however the game is made also the outlets 

00:01:32.880 --> 00:01:36.360
 know the very I show I know 

00:01:34.979 --> 00:01:38.490
 prepared in the mirror to see if 

00:01:36.360 --> 00:01:40.020
 then focus on the one above 

00:01:38.490 --> 00:01:43.229
 metallic gray I'm sorry that I don't 

00:01:40.020 --> 00:01:47.009
 you can see very well the one below is the 

00:01:43.229 --> 00:01:51.119
 golden and this green to pass precisely 

00:01:47.009 --> 00:01:53.159
 green and I like all three 

00:01:51.119 --> 00:01:54.360
 tip I'll take this vertegaal little bit 

00:01:53.159 --> 00:01:56.880
 darker then 

00:01:54.360 --> 00:02:05.910
 it is a classic long lasting therefore of 

00:01:56.880 --> 00:02:08.640
 those that turn so, however, here it is a 

00:02:05.910 --> 00:02:12.300
 penknife so I don't know according to me if 

00:02:08.640 --> 00:02:15.480
 you have the automatic precision of kiko 

00:02:12.300 --> 00:02:17.970
 maybe you can temper it with that but 

00:02:15.480 --> 00:02:21.810
 I'm not sure 

00:02:17.970 --> 00:02:26.610
 then I took two correctors of these 

00:02:21.810 --> 00:02:31.190
 stick and I took two colors on 20 tales 

00:02:26.610 --> 00:02:34.860
 of death and the 10 that nature to beige 

00:02:31.190 --> 00:02:38.340
 I will succeed in any way 

00:02:34.860 --> 00:02:41.070
 this is the natural budget of the number 10 

00:02:38.340 --> 00:02:42.900
 and this software that the number 20 

00:02:41.070 --> 00:02:46.500
 in fact, if you see one more from the colors 

00:02:42.900 --> 00:02:48.270
 on the machine looks yellowish 

00:02:46.500 --> 00:02:51.090
 photographic a reality is not really 

00:02:48.270 --> 00:02:55.590
 garden this gives more on rose and the 

00:02:51.090 --> 00:02:57.120
 swatch are these this above is 10 

00:02:55.590 --> 00:03:02.400
 so what more on the cold 

00:02:57.120 --> 00:03:03.840
 let's say the holy see looks the same and 

00:03:02.400 --> 00:03:09.209
 that I know what a little bit 

00:03:03.840 --> 00:03:12.239
 more on rosÃ© and as a consistency not not 

00:03:09.209 --> 00:03:14.100
 I feel sorry for them nothing oh no 

00:03:12.239 --> 00:03:16.620
 they crush for nothing but then I don't know 

00:03:14.100 --> 00:03:20.390
 actually on the face if they go to 

00:03:16.620 --> 00:03:25.049
 cover up dark circles or duration anyway 

00:03:20.390 --> 00:03:27.390
 then two beautiful glosses because they are more 

00:03:25.049 --> 00:03:29.459
 or less like those of the kiko with the 

00:03:27.390 --> 00:03:36.420
 difference that cost instead of 8 euros 

00:03:29.459 --> 00:03:40.260
 by hotel room and I got the 0 8 glamor 

00:03:36.420 --> 00:03:43.380
 tube that is this without I show you 

00:03:40.260 --> 00:03:45.360
 with I show them the color they are 

00:03:43.380 --> 00:03:48.870
 these xxl shine 

00:03:45.360 --> 00:03:52.140
 and then I took this on simple pink 

00:03:48.870 --> 00:03:57.060
 always this rose I don't know why this 

00:03:52.140 --> 00:03:59.810
 is the 0 22 news kiss and also of this I have 

00:03:57.060 --> 00:03:59.810
 done already running out 

00:04:00.980 --> 00:04:12.450
 this is what they show then that 

00:04:05.280 --> 00:04:15.470
 below and above is this here on pink 

00:04:12.450 --> 00:04:21.120
 no excuse of this is the activity 

00:04:15.470 --> 00:04:25.349
 here it is that I will also do these to you 

00:04:21.120 --> 00:04:30.060
 then know the two eye shadows ni 

00:04:25.349 --> 00:04:35.190
 this is amazing this is a color here 

00:04:30.060 --> 00:04:37.680
 really nice and beautiful cappuccino 

00:04:35.190 --> 00:04:41.250
 58 and it's called cappuccino 

00:04:37.680 --> 00:04:45.810
 perfect country shimmer really 

00:04:41.250 --> 00:04:47.520
 amazing then this here that I took 

00:04:45.810 --> 00:04:49.710
 it is a long lasting eye shadow 

00:04:47.520 --> 00:04:52.979
 sorry I'm looking at the mirror because 

00:04:49.710 --> 00:04:57.000
 I couldn't see you were in the room and this 

00:04:52.979 --> 00:05:00.870
 it's called snatching up rhythms up 

00:04:57.000 --> 00:05:03.390
 sorry I took it as per 

00:05:00.870 --> 00:05:08.030
 use it as blush because on 

00:05:03.390 --> 00:05:10.050
 eyes frankly I do not sconfinfera the 

00:05:08.030 --> 00:05:12.000
 it is also this 

00:05:10.050 --> 00:05:19.800
 I must say that in short I like it 

00:05:12.000 --> 00:05:21.780
 I took a lot then the base collars 

00:05:19.800 --> 00:05:24.599
 lip base these for the pigments in 

00:05:21.780 --> 00:05:27.690
 however, I also use it as for 

00:05:24.599 --> 00:05:29.640
 fix the shade for lips or even 

00:05:27.690 --> 00:05:32.610
 before the lipstick to fix any 

00:05:29.640 --> 00:05:37.650
 in short, not too much lipstick smudges 

00:05:32.610 --> 00:05:39.510
 too much greek is dyed club and i have 

00:05:37.650 --> 00:05:40.979
 also took a gel for the lips 

00:05:39.510 --> 00:05:43.670
 this too is for those who see their lips 

00:05:40.979 --> 00:05:45.650
 sorry for the eyes 

00:05:43.670 --> 00:05:47.810
 also these for the pigments but I have it 

00:05:45.650 --> 00:05:50.180
 taken to try it under eye shadow 

00:05:47.810 --> 00:05:53.890
 just like first and though they are not if 

00:05:50.180 --> 00:05:57.560
 escapes because I haven't tried it yet e 

00:05:53.890 --> 00:06:00.320
 I took two lip colors for the mik 

00:05:57.560 --> 00:06:01.700
 the first I buy because I didn't have it 

00:06:00.320 --> 00:06:04.640
 a compact and if you see a little what not 

00:06:01.700 --> 00:06:08.930
 there roses on the bench all then taken i 

00:06:04.640 --> 00:06:13.040
 its colors or potatoes 390 something then 

00:06:08.930 --> 00:06:17.390
 this is 493 and is a champaign stain 

00:06:13.040 --> 00:06:19.880
 and the other is a 498 barry long time 

00:06:17.390 --> 00:06:23.110
 this is the good time I took it 

00:06:19.880 --> 00:06:26.300
 thinking that he gave on red instead 

00:06:23.110 --> 00:06:30.770
 you will see slightly from Puglia 

00:06:26.300 --> 00:06:32.360
 unfortunately because then they had no tester 

00:06:30.770 --> 00:06:33.320
 so he took it right to the box 

00:06:32.360 --> 00:06:35.060
 closed 

00:06:33.320 --> 00:06:38.120
 and this instead I thought he gave up 

00:06:35.060 --> 00:06:40.310
 flows instead has a strange color from 

00:06:38.120 --> 00:06:43.280
 suu kyi you want to show you then 

00:06:40.310 --> 00:06:44.900
 this above that you see that from 

00:06:43.280 --> 00:06:49.430
 machine actually looks pink but not 

00:06:44.900 --> 00:06:52.400
 it is rosy from more on a light brick it is 

00:06:49.430 --> 00:06:56.750
 this below is what I have 

00:06:52.400 --> 00:07:00.200
 on the lips and the duration I must say that 

00:06:56.750 --> 00:07:01.850
 in the bag it is good because I feel the le 

00:07:00.200 --> 00:07:05.420
 beautiful dry lips 

00:07:01.850 --> 00:07:09.860
 I'm afraid we're going to ruin here at 

00:07:05.420 --> 00:07:11.510
 hopefully not downtown and today I will bring it 

00:07:09.860 --> 00:07:13.520
 all day and let them know about 

00:07:11.510 --> 00:07:15.860
 hands don't rise to die even with 

00:07:13.520 --> 00:07:17.810
 water so let's see the result today 

00:07:15.860 --> 00:07:19.970
 of this color because I never had 

00:07:17.810 --> 00:07:21.530
 tried this feeling and the 

00:07:19.970 --> 00:07:24.050
 applications I went like a little 

00:07:21.530 --> 00:07:27.020
 even with the tip the year tip writes 

00:07:24.050 --> 00:07:30.890
 you have to go with the lower part 

00:07:27.020 --> 00:07:33.470
 of the felt pen we say why the year 

00:07:30.890 --> 00:07:35.750
 the tip defends itself a problem 

00:07:33.470 --> 00:07:39.890
 however in short for 3 euros and 90 we see a 

00:07:35.750 --> 00:07:41.480
 moment as the application in short no 

00:07:39.890 --> 00:07:43.640
 as the application as the duration more 

00:07:41.480 --> 00:07:45.590
 that the application and then no alessia 

00:07:43.640 --> 00:07:46.910
