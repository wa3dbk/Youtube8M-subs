00:04:21.050 --> 00:04:21.060 
kind of easier than that stroke because

00:04:21.060 --> 00:04:22.550 
kind of easier than that stroke because
you<00:04:21.330> haven't<00:04:21.600> watched<00:04:21.780> more<00:04:22.049> room<00:04:22.260> in<00:04:22.380> here

00:04:24.800 --> 00:04:24.810 
but I think the deal is this back piece

00:04:24.810 --> 00:04:27.280 
but I think the deal is this back piece
but<00:04:25.740> you<00:04:25.770> have<00:04:26.100> to<00:04:26.310> do<00:04:26.640> this<00:04:26.760> backwards

00:04:27.280 --> 00:04:27.290 
but you have to do this backwards

00:04:27.290 --> 00:04:29.820 
but you have to do this backwards
