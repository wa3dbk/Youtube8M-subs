for<00:00:15.870> the<00:00:15.980> live<00:00:16.980> chat<00:00:17.550> or<00:00:17.760> the<00:00:17.850> their<00:00:18.539> streaming

00:00:19.429 --> 00:00:19.439

I<00:00:19.770> think<00:00:20.369> it<00:00:20.460> has<00:00:20.609> to<00:00:20.760> do<00:00:20.880> with<00:00:20.910> the<00:00:21.920> debugging

00:00:22.910 --> 00:00:22.920 
I think it has to do with the debugging

00:00:22.920 --> 00:00:26.179 
I think it has to do with the debugging
of<00:00:23.430> the<00:00:24.240> chat<00:00:25.080> so<00:00:25.289> you<00:00:25.320> can't<00:00:25.619> watch<00:00:25.890> it<00:00:25.920> on

00:03:14.229 --> 00:03:14.239 
thin as the iPod Touch which is very

00:03:14.239 --> 00:03:16.629 
thin as the iPod Touch which is very
very<00:03:14.599> thin<00:03:14.900> as<00:03:15.109> I've<00:03:15.260> shown<00:03:15.560> you<00:03:15.590> here<00:03:15.889> so

00:03:16.629 --> 00:03:16.639 
very thin as I've shown you here so

00:03:16.639 --> 00:03:18.370 
very thin as I've shown you here so
let's<00:03:16.849> go<00:03:16.940> ahead<00:03:17.150> and<00:03:17.389> slide<00:03:17.930> it<00:03:18.109> into<00:03:18.260> the

00:03:18.370 --> 00:03:18.380 
let's go ahead and slide it into the

00:03:18.380 --> 00:03:20.830 
let's go ahead and slide it into the
case<00:03:18.680> right<00:03:18.980> now<00:03:19.130> obviously<00:03:19.400> it<00:03:20.150> doesn't<00:03:20.599> fill

00:03:20.830 --> 00:03:20.840 
case right now obviously it doesn't fill

00:03:20.840 --> 00:03:23.229 
case right now obviously it doesn't fill
out<00:03:21.049> the<00:03:21.230> case<00:03:21.440> because<00:03:22.250> it's<00:03:22.519> much<00:03:22.910> smaller

00:03:23.229 --> 00:03:23.239 
out the case because it's much smaller

00:03:23.239 --> 00:03:26.860 
out the case because it's much smaller
in<00:03:23.690> terms<00:03:23.750> of<00:03:24.049> screen<00:03:24.290> size<00:03:24.530> but<00:03:25.400> wait<00:03:25.819> one<00:03:26.209> so

00:03:26.860 --> 00:03:26.870 
in terms of screen size but wait one so

00:03:26.870 --> 00:03:28.479 
in terms of screen size but wait one so
I<00:03:26.930> went<00:03:27.139> out<00:03:27.260> to<00:03:27.379> the<00:03:27.410> store<00:03:27.739> and<00:03:28.010> bought<00:03:28.430> one

00:03:28.479 --> 00:03:28.489 
I went out to the store and bought one

00:03:28.489 --> 00:03:31.059 
I went out to the store and bought one
just<00:03:28.970> for<00:03:29.150> this<00:03:29.239> comparison<00:03:30.019> and<00:03:30.560> I<00:03:30.680> think<00:03:30.950> the

00:03:31.059 --> 00:03:31.069 
just for this comparison and I think the

00:03:31.069 --> 00:03:33.009 
just for this comparison and I think the
results<00:03:31.489> might<00:03:31.669> feel<00:03:31.910> surprising<00:03:32.599> so<00:03:32.810> let's

00:03:33.009 --> 00:03:33.019 
results might feel surprising so let's

00:03:33.019 --> 00:03:35.530 
results might feel surprising so let's
go<00:03:33.139> ahead<00:03:33.260> and<00:03:33.829> get<00:03:34.220> this<00:03:34.400> iPod<00:03:34.849> Touch<00:03:35.090> out<00:03:35.329> of

00:03:35.530 --> 00:03:35.540 
go ahead and get this iPod Touch out of

00:03:35.540 --> 00:03:37.809 
go ahead and get this iPod Touch out of
the<00:03:35.660> budget<00:03:35.840> does<00:03:36.290> have<00:03:36.470> a<00:03:36.500> ps2<00:03:36.950> notes<00:03:37.280> inside

00:03:37.809 --> 00:03:37.819 
the budget does have a ps2 notes inside

00:03:37.819 --> 00:03:40.360 
the budget does have a ps2 notes inside

is<00:04:01.340> I<00:04:01.730> understand<00:04:02.209> of<00:04:02.329> course<00:04:02.359> the<00:04:02.720> fact<00:04:03.199> is<00:04:03.349> it

00:04:03.490 --> 00:04:03.500 
is I understand of course the fact is it

00:04:03.500 --> 00:04:06.180 
is I understand of course the fact is it
is<00:04:03.650> larger<00:04:04.129> in<00:04:04.280> height<00:04:04.489> width<00:04:04.910> to<00:04:05.359> accommodate

00:04:06.180 --> 00:04:06.190 
is larger in height width to accommodate

00:04:06.190 --> 00:04:09.520 
is larger in height width to accommodate
the<00:04:07.190> larger<00:04:07.609> screen<00:04:07.970> in<00:04:08.209> the<00:04:08.299> iPhone<00:04:08.690> 6<00:04:08.989> but

the larger screen in the iPhone 6 but

00:04:09.530 --> 00:04:12.780 
the larger screen in the iPhone 6 but
the<00:04:09.829> thinness<00:04:10.129> of<00:04:10.310> this<00:04:10.760> case<00:04:11.090> as<00:04:11.389> well<00:04:11.840> as<00:04:12.109> the

00:04:12.780 --> 00:04:12.790 
the thinness of this case as well as the

00:04:12.790 --> 00:04:15.479 
the thinness of this case as well as the
curved<00:04:12.969> design<00:04:13.599> reminds<00:04:14.049> me<00:04:14.290> a<00:04:14.319> lot<00:04:14.620> of<00:04:14.860> the
