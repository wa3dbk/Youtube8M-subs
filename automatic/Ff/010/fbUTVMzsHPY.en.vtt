pass on this racetrack and I think
that's<00:01:11.540> why<00:01:11.690> you<00:01:11.750> see<00:01:12.020> these<00:01:12.140> restarts<00:01:12.530> get<00:01:12.740> so

00:01:12.910 --> 00:01:12.920 
that's why you see these restarts get so

00:01:12.920 --> 00:01:14.620 
that's why you see these restarts get so
crazy<00:01:13.220> is<00:01:13.580> because<00:01:13.760> everybody's<00:01:14.360> trying<00:01:14.510> to

00:01:14.620 --> 00:01:14.630

is you because of the gearing and the
