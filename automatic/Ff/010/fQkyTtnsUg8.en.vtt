00:01:43.850 --> 00:01:43.860 
quick comparison like this is him as a

00:01:43.860 --> 00:01:46.070 
quick comparison like this is him as a
shriveled-up<00:01:44.310> mummy<00:01:44.580> form<00:01:44.909> and<00:01:45.450> he<00:01:45.570> does<00:01:45.750> call

00:01:48.380 --> 00:01:48.390 
upon the evil spirits to turn into mum

00:01:48.390 --> 00:01:50.690 
upon the evil spirits to turn into mum
raw<00:01:48.600> the<00:01:48.659> everliving<00:01:49.200> and<00:01:50.130> there's<00:01:50.430> a<00:01:50.549> quick

00:01:50.690 --> 00:01:50.700 
raw the everliving and there's a quick

00:01:50.700 --> 00:01:52.130 
raw the everliving and there's a quick
comparison<00:01:50.880> between<00:01:51.360> the<00:01:51.540> two<00:01:51.750> of<00:01:51.780> them<00:01:51.900> I

00:01:52.130 --> 00:01:52.140 
comparison between the two of them I

00:01:52.140 --> 00:01:53.749 
comparison between the two of them I
think<00:01:52.890> he<00:01:52.979> gets<00:01:53.130> I<00:01:53.220> think<00:01:53.340> I<00:01:53.549> think

00:01:53.749 --> 00:01:53.759 
think he gets I think I think

00:01:53.759 --> 00:01:56.270 
think he gets I think I think
proportionally<00:01:54.710> he<00:01:55.710> should<00:01:55.920> be<00:01:56.040> a<00:01:56.070> little

00:01:56.270 --> 00:01:56.280 
proportionally he should be a little

00:01:56.280 --> 00:01:59.690 
proportionally he should be a little
bigger<00:01:56.520> as<00:01:56.790> mum<00:01:57.030> rally<00:01:57.240> ever<00:01:57.450> living<00:01:58.610> in<00:01:59.610> the

00:01:59.690 --> 00:01:59.700 
bigger as mum rally ever living in the

00:01:59.700 --> 00:02:02.149 
bigger as mum rally ever living in the
cartoon<00:02:00.060> I<00:02:00.180> think<00:02:00.330> he<00:02:00.390> gets<00:02:00.570> much<00:02:00.750> larger<00:02:01.159> but

00:02:02.149 --> 00:02:02.159 
cartoon I think he gets much larger but

00:02:02.159 --> 00:02:03.830 
cartoon I think he gets much larger but
