00:00:41.890 --> 00:00:41.900 
I would spend I give him quite a bit of

00:00:41.900 --> 00:00:43.300 
I would spend I give him quite a bit of
time<00:00:42.020> with<00:00:42.170> him<00:00:42.320> and<00:00:42.470> I<00:00:42.530> noticed<00:00:42.890> as<00:00:43.010> he<00:00:43.040> got

00:00:43.300 --> 00:00:43.310 
time with him and I noticed as he got

00:00:43.310 --> 00:00:46.450 
time with him and I noticed as he got
older<00:00:43.370> about<00:00:43.970> 60<00:00:44.510> or<00:00:44.540> so<00:00:44.750> his<00:00:45.410> his<00:00:45.680> hips<00:00:45.980> gave

00:00:46.450 --> 00:00:46.460 
older about 60 or so his his hips gave

00:00:46.460 --> 00:00:49.870 
older about 60 or so his his hips gave
out<00:00:46.640> and<00:00:47.680> it<00:00:48.680> was<00:00:48.770> obvious<00:00:49.160> to<00:00:49.340> me<00:00:49.460> even<00:00:49.790> at

00:00:49.870 --> 00:00:49.880 
out and it was obvious to me even at

00:00:49.880 --> 00:00:52.390 
out and it was obvious to me even at
that<00:00:49.970> time<00:00:50.210> that<00:00:50.600> neither<00:00:51.410> a<00:00:51.530> walker<00:00:51.890> or<00:00:52.220> a

00:00:52.390 --> 00:00:52.400 
that time that neither a walker or a

00:00:52.400 --> 00:00:55.140 
that time that neither a walker or a
wheelchair<00:00:52.490> would<00:00:53.090> solve<00:00:53.360> this<00:00:53.450> problem

00:00:55.140 --> 00:00:55.150 
wheelchair would solve this problem

00:00:55.150 --> 00:01:00.820 
wheelchair would solve this problem
we're<00:00:56.150> talking<00:00:56.300> a<00:00:57.400> farmyard<00:00:58.400> wheel<00:00:58.730> the<00:00:59.830> dirt

00:01:00.820 --> 00:01:00.830 
we're talking a farmyard wheel the dirt

00:01:00.830 --> 00:01:03.100 
we're talking a farmyard wheel the dirt
rocks<00:01:01.400> plowed<00:01:02.090> field<00:01:02.360> the<00:01:02.630> whole<00:01:02.750> routine

00:01:03.100 --> 00:01:03.110 
rocks plowed field the whole routine

00:01:03.110 --> 00:01:04.539 
rocks plowed field the whole routine
there's<00:01:03.470> no<00:01:03.590> way<00:01:03.740> either<00:01:04.189> one<00:01:04.369> of<00:01:04.430> those

00:01:04.539 --> 00:01:04.549 
there's no way either one of those

00:01:04.549 --> 00:01:06.360 
there's no way either one of those
devices<00:01:04.759> would<00:01:05.089> have<00:01:05.180> little<00:01:05.900> work<00:01:05.990> for<00:01:06.140> him

00:01:06.360 --> 00:01:06.370 
devices would have little work for him

00:01:06.370 --> 00:01:08.380 
devices would have little work for him
actually<00:01:07.370> the<00:01:07.580> way<00:01:07.640> he<00:01:07.790> got<00:01:07.910> around<00:01:08.120> it<00:01:08.240> he's

00:01:08.380 --> 00:01:08.390 
actually the way he got around it he's

00:01:08.390 --> 00:01:09.760 
actually the way he got around it he's
parked<00:01:08.840> a<00:01:08.900> little<00:01:08.930> Ford<00:01:09.230> tractor<00:01:09.470> in<00:01:09.650> his

00:01:09.760 --> 00:01:09.770 
parked a little Ford tractor in his

00:01:09.770 --> 00:01:11.980 
parked a little Ford tractor in his
backyard<00:01:09.980> his<00:01:10.640> back<00:01:10.790> door<00:01:11.060> and<00:01:11.300> he'd<00:01:11.480> take<00:01:11.870> the

00:01:11.980 --> 00:01:11.990 
backyard his back door and he'd take the

00:01:11.990 --> 00:01:13.330 
backyard his back door and he'd take the
Ford<00:01:12.170> tract<00:01:12.410> everywhere<00:01:12.800> down<00:01:12.980> to<00:01:13.160> fuse

horses everywhere collect his mail
everything<00:01:16.250> was<00:01:16.370> this<00:01:16.460> war<00:01:16.670> tractor<00:01:17.090> I<00:01:17.780> knew

00:01:18.490 --> 00:01:18.500 
everything was this war tractor I knew

00:01:18.500 --> 00:01:20.260 
everything was this war tractor I knew
again<00:01:19.100> at<00:01:19.430> that<00:01:19.640> age<00:01:19.820> there<00:01:20.060> had<00:01:20.180> to<00:01:20.210> be

00:01:20.260 --> 00:01:20.270 
again at that age there had to be

00:01:20.270 --> 00:01:21.610 
again at that age there had to be
something<00:01:20.510> better<00:01:20.659> I<00:01:20.810> didn't<00:01:21.170> had<00:01:21.260> no<00:01:21.350> idea

00:01:21.610 --> 00:01:21.620 
something better I didn't had no idea

something better I didn't had no idea
what<00:01:21.800> the<00:01:22.150> solution<00:01:23.150> was<00:01:23.300> but<00:01:23.659> I<00:01:23.870> knew<00:01:24.050> it

00:01:24.340 --> 00:01:24.350 
what the solution was but I knew it

00:01:24.350 --> 00:01:28.330 
what the solution was but I knew it
needed<00:01:24.740> a<00:01:24.980> solution<00:01:25.130> so<00:01:26.920> fast<00:01:27.920> forward<00:01:28.250> about

00:01:28.330 --> 00:01:28.340 
needed a solution so fast forward about

00:01:28.340 --> 00:01:33.370 
needed a solution so fast forward about
sixty<00:01:29.060> years<00:01:29.090> or<00:01:29.420> so<00:01:29.740> my<00:01:30.740> brother<00:01:32.380> same
