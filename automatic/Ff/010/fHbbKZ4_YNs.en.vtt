00:00:01.950 --> 00:00:06.660
 the little dance 

00:00:22.690 --> 00:00:28.040
 hello okay 

00:00:24.800 --> 00:00:30.200
 Hi! How are you? I'm fine, Pedro. 

00:00:28.040 --> 00:00:32.510
 cavalcanti teacher here from the school of 

00:00:30.200 --> 00:00:34.370
 jazz and blues guitar leon and today we 

00:00:32.510 --> 00:00:36.350
 Let's learn a little bit about what the 

00:00:34.370 --> 00:00:38.420
 on the drums more specifically a 

00:00:36.350 --> 00:00:56.269
 little of the swing musical rhythm 

00:00:38.420 --> 00:00:57.739
 bora there I said if that and swing 

00:00:56.269 --> 00:00:59.540
 is a musical style that had great 

00:00:57.739 --> 00:01:01.640
 popularity in the United States in 

00:00:59.540 --> 00:01:04.280
 decades of 30 and 40 

00:01:01.640 --> 00:01:07.130
 the famous with the bibles of musicians 

00:01:04.280 --> 00:01:08.780
 dancing fat tommy dorsey and what 

00:01:07.130 --> 00:01:10.430
 he has at the time when jazz to music 

00:01:08.780 --> 00:01:11.690
 made for dancing 

00:01:10.430 --> 00:01:13.159
 the public to delirium with 

00:01:11.690 --> 00:01:15.170
 different orchestrations and 

00:01:13.159 --> 00:01:17.350
 fantastic presentations debate if 

00:01:15.170 --> 00:01:23.110
 hide in clothes 

00:01:17.350 --> 00:01:23.110
 barigui time to 

00:01:28.370 --> 00:01:32.700
 but with the appearance of the second war 

00:01:30.930 --> 00:01:34.650
 problems such as inflation and 

00:01:32.700 --> 00:01:36.720
 military enlistment of several musicians 

00:01:34.650 --> 00:01:38.700
 a very large orchestra formation 

00:01:36.720 --> 00:01:40.350
 became unfeasible generating a new sun 

00:01:38.700 --> 00:01:43.290
 of the following decades, which is not 

00:01:40.350 --> 00:01:44.790
 our focus at that time and understood there 

00:01:43.290 --> 00:01:46.590
 let's start with some concepts 

00:01:44.790 --> 00:01:49.100
 for you to better understand the 

00:01:46.590 --> 00:01:51.930
 scoping exercise 

00:01:49.100 --> 00:01:54.300
 ok think a compass four by four 

00:01:51.930 --> 00:01:56.670
 This four-stroke 

00:01:54.300 --> 00:01:57.350
 at a speed of 120 beats per 

00:01:56.670 --> 00:02:00.360
 minute 

00:01:57.350 --> 00:02:02.550
 let's think now of the semi- nima the note 

00:02:00.360 --> 00:02:04.590
 that gives us quality of this measure and 

00:02:02.550 --> 00:02:06.390
 that we will use for this study 

00:02:04.590 --> 00:02:08.910
 well as a striking feature 

00:02:06.390 --> 00:02:13.370
 this rhythm to the constant drumming 

00:02:08.910 --> 00:02:13.370
 being executed four times as step 

00:02:15.920 --> 00:02:19.980
 heavy soccer with the foot also a 

00:02:18.150 --> 00:02:23.880
 important feature and will be 

00:02:19.980 --> 00:02:25.920
 executed in times 24 but did not follow 

00:02:23.880 --> 00:02:28.020
 the same pattern of feet being right 

00:02:25.920 --> 00:02:30.390
 executed four times in steps 

00:02:28.020 --> 00:02:32.880
 the fact of driving and the left as the 

00:02:30.390 --> 00:02:39.590
 crossed in the box twice in time 

00:02:32.880 --> 00:02:39.590
 24 is identifying pace 

00:02:41.460 --> 00:02:47.540
 try increasing the speed of 

00:02:43.260 --> 00:02:47.540
 execution for 230 beats by me 

00:02:56.200 --> 00:03:02.930
 easy nÃ© caught us not worried and 

00:03:00.290 --> 00:03:04.940
 Let's go step by step as well. 

00:03:02.930 --> 00:03:06.500
 subway or for even lower speed 

00:03:04.940 --> 00:03:08.690
 to be beaten per minute thinking 

00:03:06.500 --> 00:03:11.000
 as always at their minimum 

00:03:08.690 --> 00:03:13.250
 Now let's run our feet by putting a 

00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:17.299
 boom in times one and three and a football 

00:03:13.250 --> 00:03:19.700
 daring with one foot in the times of 24 

00:03:17.299 --> 00:03:21.379
 this initial movement of the feet as a base 

00:03:19.700 --> 00:03:23.569
 with both hands on the clear box 

00:03:21.379 --> 00:03:26.000
 we will perform an alternate low with 

00:03:23.569 --> 00:03:28.040
 each one about it is a bit confusing in the 

00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:29.269
 start but do not worry about training 

00:03:28.040 --> 00:03:31.610
 you get used to it 

00:03:29.269 --> 00:03:32.569
 now perform two beats are trained 

00:03:31.610 --> 00:03:35.359
 with each hand 

00:03:32.569 --> 00:03:36.799
 the known right with the panorama does not 

00:03:35.359 --> 00:03:40.040
 forget to keep your feet the same 

00:03:36.799 --> 00:03:42.260
 standard and legal 

00:03:40.040 --> 00:03:43.099
 Let's now attack with four beats in 

00:03:42.260 --> 00:03:44.959
 each hand 

00:03:43.099 --> 00:03:46.910
 repeat each exercise until you feel 

00:03:44.959 --> 00:03:49.120
 comfortable to perform various 

00:03:46.910 --> 00:03:49.120
 speeds 

00:03:49.420 --> 00:03:55.129
 Let's now to the fix near ours 

00:03:52.010 --> 00:03:57.049
 reminders table uniformity in the 

00:03:55.129 --> 00:03:59.269
 movement of hands and feet to have a sound 

00:03:57.049 --> 00:04:00.950
 of the same volume all the time 

00:03:59.269 --> 00:04:02.540
 make sure that no part of the 

00:04:00.950 --> 00:04:03.380
 instrument is ringing higher than 

00:04:02.540 --> 00:04:05.209
 that the other 

00:04:03.380 --> 00:04:07.069
 since we talk about the volume is very 

00:04:05.209 --> 00:04:09.169
 important that you practice exercises in 

00:04:07.069 --> 00:04:09.950
 various speeds and high volumes 

00:04:09.169 --> 00:04:12.139
 and low 

00:04:09.950 --> 00:04:14.510
 remember the main function of the battery 

00:04:12.139 --> 00:04:16.130
 a musical ensemble is to promote the rhythm and 

00:04:14.510 --> 00:04:17.060
 not be higher or lower than the 

00:04:16.130 --> 00:04:19.489
 rest of him 

00:04:17.060 --> 00:04:21.200
 always study with the metronome is easy 

00:04:19.489 --> 00:04:23.120
 meter one and in addition has several models 

00:04:21.200 --> 00:04:26.510
 free digital 

00:04:23.120 --> 00:04:27.950
 Let's now go to the final exercise now. 

00:04:26.510 --> 00:04:30.440
 that you have already learned the pattern is only 

00:04:27.950 --> 00:04:32.750
 send bullet tuning subway to 120 

00:04:30.440 --> 00:04:33.520
 beats per minute and run the world and 

00:04:32.750 --> 00:04:35.110
 right hand 

00:04:33.520 --> 00:04:37.539
 a four-stroke driving plate 

00:04:35.110 --> 00:04:39.879
 of guilt and music through the 

00:04:37.539 --> 00:04:40.660
 used pipe with the foot in times of the z 

00:04:39.879 --> 00:04:42.789
 4 

00:04:40.660 --> 00:04:44.729
 it only goes from electronic speed when 

00:04:42.789 --> 00:04:48.599
 Are you sure you are performing exercises? 

00:04:44.729 --> 00:04:48.599
 properly from the current speed 

00:05:12.370 --> 00:05:17.770
 and I like it, I hope so, I hope 

00:05:15.310 --> 00:05:20.020
 has understood the function of the battery 

00:05:17.770 --> 00:05:22.630
 in this wonderful musical style ring 

00:05:20.020 --> 00:05:25.030
 which is the swish and see only a few 

00:05:22.630 --> 00:05:26.800
 basic exercises and a little bit of 

00:05:25.030 --> 00:05:28.960
 dedication of its logical part we already 

00:05:26.800 --> 00:05:32.530
 we were able to draw the draft of this 

00:05:28.960 --> 00:05:34.330
 rhythm on the drums is well I hope 

00:05:32.530 --> 00:05:36.729
 have you liked pedro cavalcanti 

00:05:34.330 --> 00:05:39.729
 teacher who of jazz and blues school 

00:05:36.729 --> 00:05:41.290
 guitar leon and be sure to watch the 

00:05:39.729 --> 00:05:44.050
 other videos from this channel and remember 

00:05:41.290 --> 00:05:46.300
 without the music to decorate it the life does not 

00:05:44.050 --> 00:05:47.949
 would be nothing more than deadlines to meet 

00:05:46.300 --> 00:05:50.370
 and accounts payable 

00:05:47.949 --> 00:05:50.370
 thank you
