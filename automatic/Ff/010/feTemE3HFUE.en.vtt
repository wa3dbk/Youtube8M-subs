00:00:08.019 --> 00:00:13.750
 spiders are usually known 

00:00:11.110 --> 00:00:16.270
 as insect predators but a 

00:00:13.750 --> 00:00:18.730
 new study suggests that consumption of 

00:00:16.270 --> 00:00:22.680
 the fish is very extensive among 

00:00:18.730 --> 00:00:22.680
 Species that live near water 

00:00:23.680 --> 00:00:29.350
 Martin and feller from the University of 

00:00:26.380 --> 00:00:31.690
 basel in switzerland and bradley I put the 

00:00:29.350 --> 00:00:33.730
 university of western australia it 

00:00:31.690 --> 00:00:38.310
 they gathered documented numerous 

00:00:33.730 --> 00:00:38.310
 incidents of spiders that catch fish 

00:00:39.490 --> 00:00:44.470
 according to the study presented by 

00:00:41.800 --> 00:00:47.410
 these two scientists in some cases 

00:00:44.470 --> 00:00:49.930
 arachnids use powerful poisons 

00:00:47.410 --> 00:00:53.100
 to kill the fish that were a lot 

00:00:49.930 --> 00:00:53.100
 bigger than them 

00:00:53.500 --> 00:00:58.360
 the study also shows that they have 

00:00:55.720 --> 00:01:00.640
 observed in its habitat up to five 

00:00:58.360 --> 00:01:04.000
 Spider families eating fish 

00:01:00.640 --> 00:01:06.220
 small and three other families contain 

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:08.910
 species that fish in condition of 

00:01:06.220 --> 00:01:08.910
 laboratory 

00:01:09.170 --> 00:01:14.600
 these semi-aquatic spiders inhabit 

00:01:12.259 --> 00:01:18.370
 normally in the margins of small 

00:01:14.600 --> 00:01:21.280
 streams ponds or swamps 

00:01:18.370 --> 00:01:24.810
 some are able to swim and dive 

00:01:21.280 --> 00:01:27.750
 walk on the surface of the water 

00:01:24.810 --> 00:01:30.960
 but generally they have powerful 

00:01:27.750 --> 00:01:33.990
 neurotoxins and enzymes that allow them 

00:01:30.960 --> 00:01:37.009
 kill and digest bigger fish and 

00:01:33.990 --> 00:01:37.009
 heavy that they 

00:01:38.500 --> 00:01:44.470
 the fish caught by the spiders 

00:01:40.720 --> 00:01:48.230
 studied were on average around 

00:01:44.470 --> 00:01:50.720
 twice as long as their predators 

00:01:48.230 --> 00:01:53.780
 so next time your kids will 

00:01:50.720 --> 00:01:56.090
 ask what the spiders eat 

00:01:53.780 --> 00:01:58.570
 explain to them that there are spiders that eat 

00:01:56.090 --> 00:01:58.570
 fishes
