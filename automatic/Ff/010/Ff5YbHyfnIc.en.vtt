here<00:00:29.789> is<00:00:29.970> a<00:00:30.510> shutoff<00:00:31.470> valve<00:00:31.769> that<00:00:31.980> I<00:00:32.040> bought<00:00:32.279> at

00:00:32.450 --> 00:00:32.460 
here is a shutoff valve that I bought at

00:00:32.460 --> 00:00:35.780 
here is a shutoff valve that I bought at
my<00:00:32.489> home<00:00:32.880> improvement<00:00:33.420> center<00:00:33.690> this<00:00:34.559> is<00:00:34.829> a<00:00:35.130> 1/2

00:00:35.780 --> 00:00:35.790 
my home improvement center this is a 1/2

00:00:35.790 --> 00:00:40.430 
my home improvement center this is a 1/2
inch<00:00:36.090> connection<00:00:36.590> to<00:00:37.590> a<00:00:37.890> 3/8<00:00:38.460> out<00:00:38.760> and<00:00:39.379> this<00:00:40.379> is

00:00:40.430 --> 00:00:40.440 
inch connection to a 3/8 out and this is

00:00:40.440 --> 00:00:42.770 
inch connection to a 3/8 out and this is
a<00:00:40.680> quarter<00:00:41.040> turn<00:00:41.280> valve<00:00:41.610> which<00:00:42.239> I<00:00:42.390> think<00:00:42.629> is

00:00:42.770 --> 00:00:42.780 
a quarter turn valve which I think is

00:00:42.780 --> 00:00:45.740 
a quarter turn valve which I think is
far<00:00:43.020> superior<00:00:43.290> to<00:00:43.710> a<00:00:43.890> multi-term<00:00:44.690> there's<00:00:45.690> a

00:00:45.740 --> 00:00:45.750 
far superior to a multi-term there's a

00:00:45.750 --> 00:00:47.660 
far superior to a multi-term there's a
ball<00:00:45.960> valve<00:00:45.989> inside<00:00:46.620> here<00:00:47.010> instead<00:00:47.399> of<00:00:47.550> the

00:00:47.660 --> 00:00:47.670 
ball valve inside here instead of the

00:00:47.670 --> 00:00:49.850 
ball valve inside here instead of the
needle<00:00:47.969> valve<00:00:48.020> that's<00:00:49.020> typical<00:00:49.680> with<00:00:49.710> a

00:00:49.850 --> 00:00:49.860 
needle valve that's typical with a

00:00:49.860 --> 00:00:52.639 
needle valve that's typical with a
multi-term<00:00:50.370> valve<00:00:50.750> one<00:00:51.750> turn<00:00:52.020> and<00:00:52.260> that's<00:00:52.410> off

00:00:52.639 --> 00:00:52.649 
multi-term valve one turn and that's off

00:00:52.649 --> 00:00:55.220 
multi-term valve one turn and that's off
a<00:00:53.100> lot<00:00:53.370> more<00:00:53.399> reliable<00:00:53.940> a<00:00:54.270> lot<00:00:54.660> easier<00:00:55.050> to<00:00:55.199> use

00:00:55.220 --> 00:00:55.230 
a lot more reliable a lot easier to use

00:00:55.230 --> 00:00:57.490 
a lot more reliable a lot easier to use
I<00:00:55.680> recommend<00:00:56.190> it

00:00:57.490 --> 00:00:57.500 
I recommend it

00:00:57.500 --> 00:01:02.119 
I recommend it
so<00:00:58.500> once<00:00:58.710> your<00:00:58.859> water's<00:00:59.190> turned<00:00:59.399> off<00:01:01.129> you're

00:01:02.119 --> 00:01:02.129 
so once your water's turned off you're

00:01:02.129 --> 00:01:04.219 
so once your water's turned off you're
going<00:01:02.309> to<00:01:02.370> be<00:01:02.460> dealing<00:01:02.640> with<00:01:02.930> this<00:01:03.930> is<00:01:04.110> the

00:01:04.219 --> 00:01:04.229 
going to be dealing with this is the

00:01:04.229 --> 00:01:05.780 
going to be dealing with this is the
valve<00:01:04.409> that's<00:01:04.680> that<00:01:04.920> we're<00:01:05.070> replacing<00:01:05.309> and

00:01:05.780 --> 00:01:05.790 
valve that's that we're replacing and

00:01:05.790 --> 00:01:07.760 
valve that's that we're replacing and
this<00:01:06.299> is<00:01:06.420> the<00:01:06.510> hose<00:01:06.689> that<00:01:06.960> connects<00:01:07.320> the<00:01:07.560> valve

00:01:07.760 --> 00:01:07.770 
this is the hose that connects the valve

00:01:07.770 --> 00:01:10.969 
this is the hose that connects the valve
to<00:01:08.040> the<00:01:08.130> toilet<00:01:08.580> this<00:01:09.270> is<00:01:09.420> a<00:01:09.450> typical<00:01:09.979> toilet

00:01:10.969 --> 00:01:10.979 
to the toilet this is a typical toilet

00:01:10.979 --> 00:01:14.210 
to the toilet this is a typical toilet
connection<00:01:11.430> it's<00:01:11.580> a<00:01:11.640> 7/8<00:01:12.119> threaded<00:01:12.689> pipe<00:01:13.650> you

00:01:14.210 --> 00:01:14.220 
connection it's a 7/8 threaded pipe you

00:01:14.220 --> 00:01:16.700 
connection it's a 7/8 threaded pipe you
don't<00:01:14.400> need<00:01:14.549> any<00:01:14.760> pipe<00:01:15.330> thread<00:01:15.960> sealant<00:01:16.380> on<00:01:16.650> a

00:01:16.700 --> 00:01:16.710 
don't need any pipe thread sealant on a

00:01:16.710 --> 00:01:20.030 
don't need any pipe thread sealant on a
plastic<00:01:17.580> connection<00:01:18.180> and<00:01:18.810> you<00:01:19.710> don't<00:01:19.890> need

00:01:20.030 --> 00:01:20.040 
plastic connection and you don't need

00:01:20.040 --> 00:01:22.940 
plastic connection and you don't need
any<00:01:20.220> pipe<00:01:21.180> thread<00:01:21.540> sealant<00:01:21.900> on<00:01:22.259> this

00:01:22.940 --> 00:01:22.950 
any pipe thread sealant on this

00:01:22.950 --> 00:01:25.160 
any pipe thread sealant on this
connection<00:01:23.580> here<00:01:23.820> because<00:01:24.180> it's<00:01:24.990> a

00:01:25.160 --> 00:01:25.170 
connection here because it's a

00:01:25.170 --> 00:01:27.410 
connection here because it's a
compression<00:01:25.880> connection<00:01:26.880> and<00:01:27.030> there's<00:01:27.360> a

00:01:27.410 --> 00:01:27.420 
compression connection and there's a

00:01:27.420 --> 00:01:29.030 
compression connection and there's a
gasket<00:01:27.659> in<00:01:27.990> there<00:01:28.140> that<00:01:28.350> seals<00:01:28.619> the<00:01:28.710> threads

00:01:29.030 --> 00:01:29.040 
gasket in there that seals the threads

00:01:29.040 --> 00:01:31.249 
gasket in there that seals the threads
for<00:01:29.310> you<00:01:29.460> you<00:01:30.150> don't<00:01:30.299> need<00:01:30.450> this<00:01:30.540> on<00:01:30.780> there<00:01:30.990> for

00:01:31.249 --> 00:01:31.259 
for you you don't need this on there for

00:01:31.259 --> 00:01:33.080 
for you you don't need this on there for
this<00:01:31.350> situation<00:01:31.700> go<00:01:32.700> ahead<00:01:32.759> and<00:01:32.909> take<00:01:33.060> that

00:01:33.080 --> 00:01:33.090 
this situation go ahead and take that

00:01:33.090 --> 00:01:36.679 
this situation go ahead and take that
off<00:01:34.369> and<00:01:35.369> what<00:01:35.460> we're<00:01:35.579> going<00:01:35.670> to<00:01:35.759> do<00:01:35.880> is<00:01:36.150> thread
