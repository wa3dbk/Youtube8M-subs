let's get this Arsenal business out of

00:00:46.500 --> 00:00:47.779 
let's get this Arsenal business out of
the<00:00:46.680> way<00:00:46.710> because<00:00:47.070> it's<00:00:47.250> such<00:00:47.399> a<00:00:47.430> long<00:00:47.610> time

00:00:47.779 --> 00:00:47.789 
the way because it's such a long time

00:00:47.789 --> 00:00:49.850 
the way because it's such a long time
ago<00:00:47.850> and<00:00:48.210> yet<00:00:48.420> it<00:00:48.600> sort<00:00:48.960> of<00:00:49.020> hangs<00:00:49.289> over<00:00:49.710> you

00:00:49.850 --> 00:00:49.860 
ago and yet it sort of hangs over you

00:00:49.860 --> 00:00:53.450 
ago and yet it sort of hangs over you
doesn't<00:00:50.160> it<00:00:50.280> I<00:00:50.460> think<00:00:50.879> so<00:00:51.059> I<00:00:51.270> was<00:00:52.260> enjoying<00:00:53.070> my

00:00:53.450 --> 00:00:53.460 
doesn't it I think so I was enjoying my

00:00:53.460 --> 00:00:55.910 
doesn't it I think so I was enjoying my
myself<00:00:53.969> in<00:00:54.090> the<00:00:54.239> Arsenal<00:00:54.870> but<00:00:55.079> it's<00:00:55.649> difficult

00:00:55.910 --> 00:00:55.920 
myself in the Arsenal but it's difficult

00:00:55.920 --> 00:00:58.670 
myself in the Arsenal but it's difficult
to<00:00:56.160> said<00:00:56.370> no<00:00:56.550> to<00:00:57.270> Real<00:00:57.510> Madrid<00:00:57.840> and<00:00:58.050> that's

00:00:58.670 --> 00:00:58.680 
to said no to Real Madrid and that's

00:00:58.680 --> 00:01:01.670 
to said no to Real Madrid and that's
where<00:00:58.859> I<00:00:59.420> left<00:01:00.420> Arsenal<00:01:00.899> then<00:01:01.260> you<00:01:01.410> came<00:01:01.649> back

00:01:01.670 --> 00:01:01.680 
where I left Arsenal then you came back

00:01:01.680 --> 00:01:05.380 
where I left Arsenal then you came back
to<00:01:02.039> England<00:01:02.129> and<00:01:02.699> you<00:01:02.989> went<00:01:03.989> to<00:01:04.080> Liverpool<00:01:04.260> and

00:01:05.380 --> 00:01:05.390 
to England and you went to Liverpool and

00:01:05.390 --> 00:01:07.789 
to England and you went to Liverpool and
I'm<00:01:06.390> think<00:01:06.960> I'm<00:01:07.080> right<00:01:07.229> in<00:01:07.260> saying<00:01:07.320> that<00:01:07.650> in

00:01:07.789 --> 00:01:07.799 
I'm think I'm right in saying that in

00:01:07.799 --> 00:01:09.770 
I'm think I'm right in saying that in
your<00:01:07.830> mind<00:01:08.369> those<00:01:08.729> were<00:01:08.850> the<00:01:09.000> six<00:01:09.420> best

00:01:09.770 --> 00:01:09.780 
your mind those were the six best

00:01:09.780 --> 00:01:11.750 
your mind those were the six best
footballing<00:01:10.409> months<00:01:10.860> of<00:01:11.010> your<00:01:11.430> career

00:01:11.750 --> 00:01:11.760 
footballing months of your career

00:01:11.760 --> 00:01:15.140 
footballing months of your career
because<00:01:12.240> I<00:01:12.360> think<00:01:12.420> the<00:01:13.700> blade<00:01:14.700> me<00:01:14.909> in<00:01:14.970> my

00:01:15.140 --> 00:01:15.150 
because I think the blade me in my

00:01:15.150 --> 00:01:18.370 
because I think the blade me in my
position<00:01:15.600> I<00:01:15.750> was<00:01:16.170> like<00:01:16.409> a<00:01:16.880> beginner<00:01:17.880> striker

00:01:18.370 --> 00:01:18.380 
position I was like a beginner striker

00:01:18.380 --> 00:01:24.679 
position I was like a beginner striker
again<00:01:19.380> Michael<00:01:19.770> Owen<00:01:19.979> I<00:01:20.159> wanted<00:01:20.700> to<00:01:20.820> assign<00:01:23.689> to

00:01:24.679 --> 00:01:24.689 
again Michael Owen I wanted to assign to

00:01:24.689 --> 00:01:26.560 
again Michael Owen I wanted to assign to
stay<00:01:24.869> more<00:01:25.110> longer<00:01:25.380> in<00:01:25.500> a<00:01:25.619> neighborhood<00:01:26.250> but

00:01:26.560 --> 00:01:26.570 
stay more longer in a neighborhood but

00:01:26.570 --> 00:01:31.190 
stay more longer in a neighborhood but
in<00:01:27.570> the<00:01:27.900> end<00:01:28.020> the<00:01:28.500> manager<00:01:28.950> decided<00:01:30.200> another

00:01:31.190 --> 00:01:31.200 
in the end the manager decided another

00:01:31.200 --> 00:01:32.840 
in the end the manager decided another
way<00:01:31.350> to<00:01:31.409> think<00:01:31.890> that<00:01:32.009> if<00:01:32.159> you'd<00:01:32.310> signed<00:01:32.640> for

00:01:32.840 --> 00:01:32.850 
way to think that if you'd signed for

00:01:32.850 --> 00:01:35.690 
way to think that if you'd signed for
Liverpool<00:01:32.939> then<00:01:33.720> at<00:01:34.590> that<00:01:34.860> key<00:01:35.280> age<00:01:35.460> and

00:01:35.690 --> 00:01:35.700 
Liverpool then at that key age and

00:01:35.700 --> 00:01:37.190 
Liverpool then at that key age and
applies<00:01:36.000> career<00:01:36.360> you<00:01:36.479> might<00:01:36.630> still<00:01:36.900> be<00:01:37.049> there

00:01:37.190 --> 00:01:37.200 
applies career you might still be there

00:01:37.200 --> 00:01:39.950 
applies career you might still be there
today<00:01:37.380> yeah<00:01:37.799> think<00:01:38.369> so<00:01:38.430> because<00:01:39.090> like<00:01:39.750> I<00:01:39.900> said

00:02:36.870 --> 00:02:40.430 
were the one who took the final penalty
when<00:02:37.650> I<00:02:37.680> had<00:02:37.920> to<00:02:38.630> to<00:02:39.630> shoot<00:02:39.900> and<00:02:40.080> score<00:02:40.320> the

00:02:40.430 --> 00:02:40.440 
when I had to to shoot and score the

00:02:40.440 --> 00:02:44.210 
when I had to to shoot and score the
last<00:02:40.590> penalty<00:02:41.100> I<00:02:41.540> miss<00:02:42.540> so<00:02:43.500> it<00:02:43.620> was<00:02:43.830> it<00:02:44.190> was

00:02:44.210 --> 00:02:44.220 
last penalty I miss so it was it was

00:02:44.220 --> 00:02:46.370 
last penalty I miss so it was it was
hard<00:02:44.580> for<00:02:44.850> me<00:02:44.940> because<00:02:45.060> in<00:02:45.480> my<00:02:45.540> mind<00:02:45.810> it<00:02:46.170> was

00:02:46.370 --> 00:02:46.380 
hard for me because in my mind it was

00:02:46.380 --> 00:02:51.410 
hard for me because in my mind it was
like<00:02:46.440> I<00:02:47.510> you<00:02:48.510> say<00:02:48.720> I<00:02:49.250> mess<00:02:50.250> up<00:02:50.280> everything<00:02:51.120> they

00:02:51.410 --> 00:02:51.420 
like I you say I mess up everything they

00:02:51.420 --> 00:02:53.480 
like I you say I mess up everything they
did<00:02:51.480> before<00:02:51.930> in<00:02:52.440> my<00:02:52.650> mind<00:02:52.890> it<00:02:52.980> was<00:02:53.130> my<00:02:53.310> fault

00:02:53.480 --> 00:02:53.490 
did before in my mind it was my fault

00:02:53.490 --> 00:02:59.690 
did before in my mind it was my fault
how<00:02:54.180> did<00:02:54.450> you<00:02:54.540> beat<00:02:54.950> Barcelona<00:02:58.310> good<00:02:59.310> question

00:02:59.690 --> 00:02:59.700 
how did you beat Barcelona good question

00:02:59.700 --> 00:03:03.800 
how did you beat Barcelona good question
I<00:03:01.340> think<00:03:02.340> to<00:03:02.459> score<00:03:02.700> goals<00:03:02.730> you<00:03:03.390> have<00:03:03.510> to<00:03:03.630> score

00:03:03.800 --> 00:03:03.810 
I think to score goals you have to score

00:03:03.810 --> 00:03:06.440 
I think to score goals you have to score
goals<00:03:04.050> and<00:03:04.580> against<00:03:05.580> then<00:03:05.880> because<00:03:06.180> we<00:03:06.300> will

00:03:06.440 --> 00:03:06.450 
goals and against then because we will

00:03:06.450 --> 00:03:08.690 
goals and against then because we will
score<00:03:06.690> anywhere<00:03:07.200> I<00:03:07.260> think<00:03:07.500> and<00:03:07.769> Messi

00:03:08.690 --> 00:03:08.700 
score anywhere I think and Messi

00:03:08.700 --> 00:03:12.020 
score anywhere I think and Messi
how<00:03:09.180> good<00:03:09.390> is<00:03:09.510> he<00:03:09.810> I<00:03:09.840> was<00:03:10.410> very<00:03:10.530> good<00:03:10.769> I<00:03:11.030> think

00:03:12.020 --> 00:03:12.030 
how good is he I was very good I think

00:03:12.030 --> 00:03:13.490 
how good is he I was very good I think
you<00:03:12.120> can<00:03:12.269> do<00:03:12.390> everything<00:03:12.510> he<00:03:12.900> can<00:03:13.019> score<00:03:13.260> I<00:03:13.350> can

00:03:13.490 --> 00:03:13.500 
you can do everything he can score I can

00:03:13.500 --> 00:03:16.900 
you can do everything he can score I can
pass<00:03:13.739> you<00:03:13.769> can<00:03:13.980> able<00:03:14.910> where<00:03:15.150> ever<00:03:15.870> you<00:03:16.110> want

00:03:16.900 --> 00:03:16.910 
pass you can able where ever you want

00:03:16.910 --> 00:03:20.140 
pass you can able where ever you want
this<00:03:17.910> is<00:03:18.090> going<00:03:18.360> to<00:03:18.420> be<00:03:18.540> very<00:03:18.720> difficult<00:03:18.930> to

this is going to be very difficult to

00:03:20.150 --> 00:03:24.560 
this is going to be very difficult to
stop<00:03:21.150> him<00:03:21.330> in<00:03:21.510> and<00:03:22.019> a2<00:03:22.350> and<00:03:22.530> Chile<00:03:23.269> but<00:03:24.269> you

00:03:24.560 --> 00:03:24.570 
stop him in and a2 and Chile but you

00:03:24.570 --> 00:03:26.180
