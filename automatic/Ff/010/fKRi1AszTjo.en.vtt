00:00:52.430 --> 00:00:52.440 
rubbish midfield and defense and then

00:00:52.440 --> 00:00:54.470 
rubbish midfield and defense and then
he's<00:00:52.620> got<00:00:52.860> three<00:00:53.280> strikers<00:00:54.000> one<00:00:54.300> of<00:00:54.390> them

00:00:54.470 --> 00:00:54.480 
he's got three strikers one of them

00:00:54.480 --> 00:00:56.630 
he's got three strikers one of them
being<00:00:54.629> Daniel<00:00:55.020> Sturridge<00:00:55.440> as<00:00:55.620> well<00:00:55.800> as<00:00:55.949> toilet

00:00:56.630 --> 00:00:56.640 
being Daniel Sturridge as well as toilet

00:00:56.640 --> 00:00:58.400 
being Daniel Sturridge as well as toilet
too<00:00:56.820> i<00:00:56.850> think<00:00:56.969> normally<00:00:57.570> was<00:00:57.719> a<00:00:57.750> right<00:00:57.989> wing<00:00:58.260> of

00:00:58.400 --> 00:00:58.410 
too i think normally was a right wing of

00:00:58.410 --> 00:01:00.290 
too i think normally was a right wing of
east<00:00:58.649> concert<00:00:59.039> to<00:00:59.160> QPR<00:00:59.489> and<00:00:59.699> i<00:00:59.730> think<00:00:59.910> they<00:01:00.059> may

00:01:00.290 --> 00:01:00.300 
east concert to QPR and i think they may

00:01:00.300 --> 00:01:01.490 
east concert to QPR and i think they may
have<00:01:00.329> changed<00:01:00.600> him<00:01:00.780> to<00:01:00.870> a<00:01:00.930> centre-forward<00:01:01.170> i

00:01:01.490 --> 00:01:01.500 
have changed him to a centre-forward i

00:01:01.500 --> 00:01:02.959 
have changed him to a centre-forward i
might<00:01:01.890> be<00:01:01.980> completely<00:01:02.280> wrong<00:01:02.489> there<00:01:02.760> but<00:01:02.940> i

00:01:02.959 --> 00:01:02.969 
might be completely wrong there but i

00:01:02.969 --> 00:01:04.520 
might be completely wrong there but i
never<00:01:03.210> less<00:01:03.390> hoilett<00:01:03.719> plays<00:01:03.870> it<00:01:04.049> across<00:01:04.260> to

00:01:04.520 --> 00:01:04.530 
never less hoilett plays it across to

00:01:04.530 --> 00:01:06.710 
never less hoilett plays it across to
storage<00:01:04.890> who<00:01:05.309> does<00:01:05.610> smash<00:01:06.000> it<00:01:06.180> in<00:01:06.330> I<00:01:06.450> think<00:01:06.570> he

00:01:06.710 --> 00:01:06.720 
storage who does smash it in I think he

00:01:06.720 --> 00:01:08.179 
storage who does smash it in I think he
also<00:01:06.960> had<00:01:07.170> another<00:01:07.260> stroke<00:01:07.619> from<00:01:07.799> the<00:01:07.920> Premier

00:01:08.179 --> 00:01:08.189 
also had another stroke from the Premier

00:01:08.189 --> 00:01:11.240 
also had another stroke from the Premier
League<00:01:08.220> a<00:01:08.970> Fulham<00:01:09.810> strike<00:01:10.049> oh<00:01:10.200> I<00:01:10.229> think<00:01:10.680> might

00:01:11.240 --> 00:01:11.250 
League a Fulham strike oh I think might

00:01:11.250 --> 00:01:12.710 
League a Fulham strike oh I think might
be<00:01:11.400> transferred<00:01:11.880> I'm<00:01:12.060> probably<00:01:12.210> sounded<00:01:12.600> like

00:01:12.710 --> 00:01:12.720 
be transferred I'm probably sounded like

00:01:12.720 --> 00:01:14.060 
be transferred I'm probably sounded like
an<00:01:12.840> idiot<00:01:12.930> again<00:01:13.200> they're<00:01:13.530> saying<00:01:13.770> that<00:01:13.830> but

00:01:14.060 --> 00:01:14.070 
an idiot again they're saying that but

00:01:14.070 --> 00:01:16.310 
an idiot again they're saying that but
that's<00:01:14.790> what<00:01:14.880> I<00:01:15.000> think<00:01:15.479> but<00:01:15.720> nevertheless

00:01:16.310 --> 00:01:16.320 
that's what I think but nevertheless

00:01:16.320 --> 00:01:17.960 
that's what I think but nevertheless
this<00:01:16.560> guy<00:01:16.740> goes<00:01:16.950> for<00:01:17.130> again<00:01:17.460> with<00:01:17.670> Sturridge

00:01:17.960 --> 00:01:17.970 
this guy goes for again with Sturridge

00:01:17.970 --> 00:01:19.249 
this guy goes for again with Sturridge
and<00:01:18.150> absolutely<00:01:18.450> smash<00:01:18.780> it<00:01:18.930> then<00:01:19.020> I<00:01:19.110> was<00:01:19.200> like

00:01:28.160 --> 00:01:28.170

Kagawa and I thought his defender was
going<00:01:28.290> to<00:01:28.350> get<00:01:28.439> to<00:01:28.530> that<00:01:28.650> but<00:01:29.159> he<00:01:29.549> decided<00:01:29.880> to

00:01:29.990 --> 00:01:30.000 
going to get to that but he decided to

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:31.969 
going to get to that but he decided to

managed to get to that because my

00:02:05.040 --> 00:02:07.370 
managed to get to that because my
centre-back<00:02:05.490> was<00:02:05.700> easily<00:02:06.450> like<00:02:06.719> a<00:02:06.869> head

00:02:07.370 --> 00:02:07.380

he manages to get to the wall and does
score<00:02:11.489> there<00:02:11.700> but<00:02:11.849> we<00:02:11.940> play<00:02:12.120> the<00:02:12.300> ball<00:02:12.480> four

hard done by losing that had more shots
I'm<00:02:46.799> more<00:02:47.040> shots<00:02:47.250> on-target<00:02:47.430> he<00:02:47.939> did<00:02:48.120> have<00:02:48.209> a

00:02:48.259 --> 00:02:48.269 
I'm more shots on-target he did have a

00:02:48.269 --> 00:02:50.240 
I'm more shots on-target he did have a
little<00:02:48.389> bit<00:02:48.510> more<00:02:48.689> possession<00:02:49.169> but<00:02:49.319> that's

00:02:50.240 --> 00:02:50.250 
little bit more possession but that's

00:02:50.250 --> 00:02:51.619 
little bit more possession but that's
really<00:02:50.519> not<00:02:50.669> what<00:02:50.849> should<00:02:51.209> matter<00:02:51.359> i<00:02:51.569> guess

00:02:51.619 --> 00:02:51.629 
really not what should matter i guess

00:02:51.629 --> 00:02:53.270 
really not what should matter i guess
what<00:02:51.959> does<00:02:52.109> miras<00:02:52.409> how<00:02:52.530> many<00:02:52.680> chances<00:02:52.919> you

what does miras how many chances you

00:02:53.280 --> 00:02:55.220 
what does miras how many chances you
finish<00:02:53.730> and<00:02:53.939> we<00:02:54.000> do<00:02:54.209> Goffin<00:02:54.780> sons<00:02:55.019> of<00:02:55.139> all

more<00:02:57.269> chemistry<00:02:57.569> in<00:02:57.750> there<00:02:57.870> we<00:02:57.959> picked<00:02:58.139> up<00:02:58.230> a

00:02:58.339 --> 00:02:58.349 
more chemistry in there we picked up a

00:02:58.349 --> 00:03:01.220 
more chemistry in there we picked up a
borussia<00:02:58.889> dortmund<00:02:59.280> a<00:02:59.519> CDM<00:03:00.389> and<00:03:00.629> also<00:03:00.870> a<00:03:00.900> left

00:03:01.220 --> 00:03:01.230 
borussia dortmund a CDM and also a left

00:03:01.230 --> 00:03:02.839 
borussia dortmund a CDM and also a left
back<00:03:01.409> from<00:03:01.739> Germany<00:03:02.010> so<00:03:02.370> that'll<00:03:02.579> give<00:03:02.699> us<00:03:02.790> a

00:03:02.839 --> 00:03:02.849 
back from Germany so that'll give us a

00:03:02.849 --> 00:03:04.309 
back from Germany so that'll give us a
nice<00:03:03.030> little<00:03:03.239> German<00:03:03.689> link<00:03:03.870> there<00:03:03.989> you'll<00:03:04.139> see

00:03:04.309 --> 00:03:04.319 
nice little German link there you'll see

00:03:04.319 --> 00:03:06.740 
nice little German link there you'll see
the<00:03:04.469> kaga<00:03:05.340> will<00:03:05.549> be<00:03:05.639> up<00:03:05.730> to<00:03:05.849> 9<00:03:06.000> chemistry<00:03:06.540> now

00:03:06.740 --> 00:03:06.750 
the kaga will be up to 9 chemistry now

00:03:06.750 --> 00:03:08.420 
the kaga will be up to 9 chemistry now
and<00:03:07.109> I<00:03:07.290> think<00:03:07.500> this<00:03:07.590> Center<00:03:07.919> take<00:03:08.069> a<00:03:08.099> mid<00:03:08.280> will

00:03:08.420 --> 00:03:08.430 
and I think this Center take a mid will

00:03:08.430 --> 00:03:11.390 
and I think this Center take a mid will
and<00:03:08.699> the<00:03:08.909> left<00:03:09.599> back<00:03:09.780> and<00:03:09.959> the<00:03:10.139> CDM<00:03:10.530> should<00:03:11.189> all

00:03:11.390 --> 00:03:11.400 
and the left back and the CDM should all

00:03:11.400 --> 00:03:13.159 
and the left back and the CDM should all
be<00:03:11.549> up<00:03:11.639> to<00:03:11.760> 9<00:03:11.909> cam<00:03:12.150> now<00:03:12.329> so<00:03:12.569> that's<00:03:12.780> a<00:03:12.900> very<00:03:12.930> good

00:03:13.159 --> 00:03:13.169 
be up to 9 cam now so that's a very good

00:03:13.169 --> 00:03:14.330 
be up to 9 cam now so that's a very good
of<00:03:13.349> the<00:03:13.439> team<00:03:13.560> we've<00:03:13.709> also<00:03:13.829> kind<00:03:14.069> of<00:03:14.129> got<00:03:14.280> our

00:03:14.330 --> 00:03:14.340 
of the team we've also kind of got our

00:03:14.340 --> 00:03:16.250 
of the team we've also kind of got our
English<00:03:14.699> side<00:03:14.909> on<00:03:15.090> the<00:03:15.209> right<00:03:15.449> which<00:03:15.689> I<00:03:15.900> will

English side on the right which I will

00:03:16.260 --> 00:03:17.719 
English side on the right which I will
probably<00:03:16.530> be<00:03:16.590> adding<00:03:16.829> to<00:03:16.859> next<00:03:17.280> episode<00:03:17.579> I<00:03:17.609> do

probably be adding to next episode I do

00:03:17.729 --> 00:03:18.949 
probably be adding to next episode I do
have<00:03:17.849> a<00:03:17.939> player<00:03:18.120> I<00:03:18.209> want<00:03:18.449> to<00:03:18.540> pick<00:03:18.659> up<00:03:18.840> an

00:03:18.949 --> 00:03:18.959 
have a player I want to pick up an

00:03:18.959 --> 00:03:21.199 
have a player I want to pick up an
in-form<00:03:19.259> card<00:03:19.620> on<00:03:20.250> that<00:03:20.459> right<00:03:20.790> hand<00:03:20.909> side<00:03:21.120> of

00:03:21.199 --> 00:03:21.209 
in-form card on that right hand side of

00:03:21.209 --> 00:03:22.580 
in-form card on that right hand side of
the<00:03:21.269> pitch<00:03:21.449> but<00:03:21.750> we<00:03:22.049> go<00:03:22.169> to<00:03:22.229> the<00:03:22.349> next<00:03:22.439> thing

00:03:22.580 --> 00:03:22.590 
the pitch but we go to the next thing

00:03:22.590 --> 00:03:24.259 
the pitch but we go to the next thing
I'm<00:03:22.680> this<00:03:22.799> guy's<00:03:22.949> got<00:03:23.189> and<00:03:23.310> all<00:03:23.370> I<00:03:23.729> want<00:03:24.120> to<00:03:24.209> say

00:03:24.259 --> 00:03:24.269 
I'm this guy's got and all I want to say

00:03:24.269 --> 00:03:26.270 
I'm this guy's got and all I want to say
ligue<00:03:25.109> 1<00:03:25.139> team<00:03:25.379> but<00:03:25.799> I<00:03:25.829> think<00:03:26.040> some<00:03:26.159> of<00:03:26.189> the

00:03:26.270 --> 00:03:26.280 
ligue 1 team but I think some of the

00:03:26.280 --> 00:03:27.710 
ligue 1 team but I think some of the
players<00:03:26.430> might<00:03:26.729> be<00:03:26.849> league<00:03:27.060> two<00:03:27.299> players<00:03:27.540> as

00:03:27.710 --> 00:03:27.720 
players might be league two players as

00:03:27.720 --> 00:03:29.599 
players might be league two players as
well<00:03:27.750> because<00:03:28.049> that<00:03:28.199> weird<00:03:28.379> crush<00:03:29.220> the<00:03:29.459> top

00:03:29.599 --> 00:03:29.609 
well because that weird crush the top

00:03:29.609 --> 00:03:30.830 
well because that weird crush the top
looks<00:03:29.790> like<00:03:29.879> a<00:03:29.909> plus<00:03:30.239> sign<00:03:30.449> looks<00:03:30.659> kind<00:03:30.810> of

00:03:30.830 --> 00:03:30.840 
looks like a plus sign looks kind of

00:03:30.840 --> 00:03:32.240 
looks like a plus sign looks kind of
like<00:03:30.900> I've<00:03:31.259> never<00:03:31.409> seen<00:03:31.530> that<00:03:31.709> really<00:03:32.099> before

00:03:32.240 --> 00:03:32.250 
like I've never seen that really before

00:03:32.250 --> 00:03:34.069 
like I've never seen that really before
so<00:03:32.549> I'm<00:03:32.609> assuming<00:03:32.729> it's<00:03:33.090> leaked<00:03:33.269> too<00:03:33.449> but<00:03:33.989> he

00:03:34.069 --> 00:03:34.079 
so I'm assuming it's leaked too but he

00:03:34.079 --> 00:03:36.469 
so I'm assuming it's leaked too but he
was<00:03:34.489> quite<00:03:35.489> a<00:03:35.549> decent<00:03:35.729> player<00:03:36.060> at<00:03:36.239> least<00:03:36.389> he

00:03:36.469 --> 00:03:36.479 
was quite a decent player at least he

00:03:36.479 --> 00:03:37.789 
was quite a decent player at least he
played<00:03:36.689> decent<00:03:37.019> for<00:03:37.139> the<00:03:37.229> first<00:03:37.470> half<00:03:37.709> and

00:03:37.789 --> 00:03:37.799 
played decent for the first half and

00:03:37.799 --> 00:03:39.649 
played decent for the first half and
you'll<00:03:37.949> see<00:03:38.099> this<00:03:38.220> goal<00:03:38.459> here<00:03:38.729> was<00:03:38.879> really

00:03:39.649 --> 00:03:39.659 
you'll see this goal here was really

00:03:39.659 --> 00:03:40.999 
you'll see this goal here was really
frustrating<00:03:40.019> for<00:03:40.079> me<00:03:40.139> because<00:03:40.199> one<00:03:40.470> defender

00:03:40.999 --> 00:03:41.009 
frustrating for me because one defender

00:03:41.009 --> 00:03:43.670 
frustrating for me because one defender
was<00:03:41.129> pushing<00:03:41.519> him<00:03:41.669> and<00:03:41.970> his<00:03:42.569> striker<00:03:43.379> was<00:03:43.530> off

00:03:43.670 --> 00:03:43.680 
was pushing him and his striker was off

00:03:43.680 --> 00:03:45.229 
was pushing him and his striker was off
balance<00:03:43.889> but<00:03:44.129> he<00:03:44.220> somehow<00:03:44.370> smashes<00:03:44.939> it<00:03:45.030> across

00:03:45.229 --> 00:03:45.239 
balance but he somehow smashes it across

00:03:45.239 --> 00:03:46.580 
balance but he somehow smashes it across
the<00:03:45.299> keeper<00:03:45.659> right<00:03:45.689> in<00:03:45.989> the<00:03:46.079> bottom<00:03:46.290> corner<00:03:46.349> I

00:03:46.580 --> 00:03:46.590 
the keeper right in the bottom corner I

00:03:46.590 --> 00:03:47.629 
the keeper right in the bottom corner I
couldn't<00:03:46.829> believe<00:03:46.919> it<00:03:47.129> when<00:03:47.189> that<00:03:47.340> went<00:03:47.519> in

00:03:47.629 --> 00:03:47.639 
couldn't believe it when that went in

00:03:47.639 --> 00:03:49.339 
couldn't believe it when that went in
but<00:03:48.180> I'm<00:03:48.389> nevertheless<00:03:48.659> we<00:03:48.930> staged<00:03:49.139> during

00:03:49.339 --> 00:03:49.349 
but I'm nevertheless we staged during

00:03:49.349 --> 00:03:51.319 
but I'm nevertheless we staged during
the<00:03:49.560> game<00:03:49.739> in<00:03:49.889> the<00:03:49.979> second<00:03:50.310> half<00:03:50.430> we<00:03:50.609> came<00:03:51.120> out

00:03:51.319 --> 00:03:51.329 
the game in the second half we came out

00:03:51.329 --> 00:03:52.429 
the game in the second half we came out
you<00:03:51.449> know<00:03:51.569> a<00:03:51.599> little<00:03:51.780> bit<00:03:51.900> more<00:03:52.019> attacking<00:03:52.259> I

00:03:52.429 --> 00:03:52.439 
you know a little bit more attacking I

00:03:52.439 --> 00:03:54.229 
you know a little bit more attacking I
think<00:03:52.590> this<00:03:52.650> is<00:03:52.709> our<00:03:52.949> new<00:03:53.129> CD<00:03:53.819> hem<00:03:53.970> who<00:03:54.060> just

00:03:54.229 --> 00:03:54.239 
think this is our new CD hem who just

00:03:54.239 --> 00:03:55.460 
think this is our new CD hem who just
seemed<00:03:54.359> like<00:03:54.389> a<00:03:54.509> decent<00:03:54.870> bronze<00:03:55.259> player

00:03:55.460 --> 00:03:55.470 
seemed like a decent bronze player

00:03:55.470 --> 00:03:56.300 
seemed like a decent bronze player
obviously<00:03:55.650> he's<00:03:55.889> getting<00:03:56.099> the<00:03:56.159> nine

00:03:56.300 --> 00:03:56.310 
obviously he's getting the nine

00:03:56.310 --> 00:03:57.379 
obviously he's getting the nine
chemistry<00:03:56.759> so<00:03:56.819> he's<00:03:56.969> going<00:03:57.090> to<00:03:57.150> be<00:03:57.209> better

00:03:57.379 --> 00:03:57.389 
chemistry so he's going to be better

00:03:57.389 --> 00:03:58.969 
chemistry so he's going to be better
than<00:03:57.479> a<00:03:57.569> lot<00:03:57.689> of<00:03:57.750> the<00:03:57.840> other<00:03:58.019> players<00:03:58.199> in<00:03:58.469> the

00:03:58.969 --> 00:03:58.979 
than a lot of the other players in the

want<00:05:13.320> to<00:05:13.410> kind<00:05:13.530> of<00:05:13.590> build<00:05:13.740> at<00:05:13.890> the<00:05:13.919> chemistry

00:05:14.420 --> 00:05:14.430 
want to kind of build at the chemistry

00:05:14.430 --> 00:05:15.440 
want to kind of build at the chemistry
to<00:05:14.550> start<00:05:14.790> off<00:05:14.880> and<00:05:15.030> you<00:05:15.090> can<00:05:15.120> see<00:05:15.330> would

00:05:15.440 --> 00:05:15.450 
to start off and you can see would

00:05:15.450 --> 00:05:17.300 
to start off and you can see would
nearly<00:05:15.600> up<00:05:15.720> to<00:05:15.840> 90<00:05:16.110> chemistry<00:05:16.560> there<00:05:16.770> so<00:05:17.160> he's

00:05:17.300 --> 00:05:17.310 
nearly up to 90 chemistry there so he's

00:05:17.310 --> 00:05:19.220 
nearly up to 90 chemistry there so he's
going<00:05:17.430> to<00:05:17.490> replace<00:05:17.820> I<00:05:18.060> think<00:05:18.360> it's<00:05:18.510> Cameron

00:05:19.220 --> 00:05:19.230 
going to replace I think it's Cameron

00:05:19.230 --> 00:05:20.750 
going to replace I think it's Cameron
the<00:05:19.350> really<00:05:19.590> Pacey<00:05:19.830> center<00:05:20.250> back<00:05:20.370> bar<00:05:20.550> as<00:05:20.669> the

the really Pacey center back bar as the
centre-back<00:05:21.060> is<00:05:21.180> quite<00:05:21.600> Pacey<00:05:21.810> as<00:05:21.960> well<00:05:22.080> and

00:05:22.190 --> 00:05:22.200 
centre-back is quite Pacey as well and

00:05:22.200 --> 00:05:23.450 
centre-back is quite Pacey as well and
he's<00:05:22.290> obviously<00:05:22.500> again<00:05:22.740> a<00:05:22.770> strong<00:05:23.040> link<00:05:23.220> over

00:05:23.450 --> 00:05:23.460 
he's obviously again a strong link over

00:05:23.460 --> 00:05:24.950 
he's obviously again a strong link over
there<00:05:23.610> were<00:05:23.669> a<00:05:23.760> couple<00:05:23.790> of<00:05:24.060> other<00:05:24.210> players<00:05:24.360> but

national finger which that's about 100 k
but<00:05:43.200> the<00:05:43.260> stats<00:05:43.500> on<00:05:43.620> this<00:05:43.740> one<00:05:43.890> seemed<00:05:44.070> good

00:05:44.210 --> 00:05:44.220 
but the stats on this one seemed good

00:05:44.220 --> 00:05:46.870 
but the stats on this one seemed good
enough<00:05:44.280> he's<00:05:44.580> got<00:05:44.729> like<00:05:44.850> 85<00:05:45.360> shooting<00:05:45.960> 85<00:05:46.380> pace

00:05:46.870 --> 00:05:46.880 
enough he's got like 85 shooting 85 pace

enough he's got like 85 shooting 85 pace
four-star<00:05:47.880> skills<00:05:48.120> forced<00:05:48.419> our<00:05:48.510> week<00:05:48.720> for<00:05:48.930> i'm

00:05:49.040 --> 00:05:49.050 
four-star skills forced our week for i'm

00:05:49.050 --> 00:05:51.230 
four-star skills forced our week for i'm
pretty<00:05:49.410> sure<00:05:49.770> so<00:05:50.100> he<00:05:50.700> looks<00:05:50.850> like<00:05:50.970> a<00:05:51.000> very

00:05:51.230 --> 00:05:51.240 
pretty sure so he looks like a very

00:05:51.240 --> 00:05:52.460 
pretty sure so he looks like a very
solid<00:05:51.660> player<00:05:51.810> we've<00:05:51.990> got<00:05:52.140> him<00:05:52.229> in<00:05:52.350> there

00:05:52.460 --> 00:05:52.470 
solid player we've got him in there

00:05:52.470 --> 00:05:55.040 
solid player we've got him in there
you'll<00:05:52.620> see<00:05:52.830> any<00:05:53.040> stats<00:05:53.940> are<00:05:54.150> very<00:05:54.450> very<00:05:54.690> solid

00:05:55.040 --> 00:05:55.050 
you'll see any stats are very very solid

00:05:55.050 --> 00:05:56.840 
you'll see any stats are very very solid
i'm<00:05:55.169> hoping<00:05:55.440> to<00:05:55.470> you<00:05:56.280> know<00:05:56.310> have<00:05:56.490> some<00:05:56.669> fun

00:05:56.840 --> 00:05:56.850 
i'm hoping to you know have some fun

00:05:56.850 --> 00:05:58.040 
i'm hoping to you know have some fun
with<00:05:56.970> him<00:05:57.150> at<00:05:57.300> the<00:05:57.330> other<00:05:57.570> Center<00:05:57.840> attack

00:05:58.040 --> 00:05:58.050 
with him at the other Center attack

00:05:58.050 --> 00:05:59.390 
with him at the other Center attack
admitted<00:05:58.320> we<00:05:58.380> had<00:05:58.410> wasn't<00:05:58.830> really<00:05:59.100> getting<00:05:59.220> in

00:05:59.390 --> 00:05:59.400 
admitted we had wasn't really getting in

00:05:59.400 --> 00:06:01.070 
admitted we had wasn't really getting in
the<00:05:59.490> game<00:05:59.640> that<00:05:59.910> much<00:06:00.090> and<00:06:00.300> I<00:06:00.330> think<00:06:00.570> Roy<00:06:00.810> stirs

00:06:01.070 --> 00:06:01.080 
the game that much and I think Roy stirs

00:06:01.080 --> 00:06:03.440 
the game that much and I think Roy stirs
have<00:06:01.320> at<00:06:02.190> high<00:06:02.490> attack<00:06:02.729> and<00:06:02.910> work-rate<00:06:03.180> so<00:06:03.360> we

00:06:03.440 --> 00:06:03.450 
have at high attack and work-rate so we

00:06:03.450 --> 00:06:04.940 
have at high attack and work-rate so we
should<00:06:03.630> get<00:06:03.750> into<00:06:03.930> the<00:06:04.020> action<00:06:04.290> quite<00:06:04.530> a<00:06:04.560> lot

00:06:04.940 --> 00:06:04.950 
should get into the action quite a lot

00:06:04.950 --> 00:06:06.620 
should get into the action quite a lot
we'll<00:06:05.130> see<00:06:05.280> how<00:06:05.430> he<00:06:05.460> goes<00:06:05.580> in<00:06:06.030> the<00:06:06.390> coming

00:06:06.620 --> 00:06:06.630 
we'll see how he goes in the coming

00:06:06.630 --> 00:06:08.780 
we'll see how he goes in the coming
episodes<00:06:06.810> but<00:06:07.260> just<00:06:08.250> to<00:06:08.310> finish<00:06:08.400> off<00:06:08.610> we'll<00:06:08.760> go

00:06:08.780 --> 00:06:08.790 
episodes but just to finish off we'll go

00:06:08.790 --> 00:06:10.340 
episodes but just to finish off we'll go
to<00:06:08.910> the<00:06:08.970> trade<00:06:09.210> pile<00:06:09.419> the<00:06:09.870> only<00:06:10.050> player<00:06:10.229> that

of real importance we have left is
Vertonghen<00:06:12.419> but<00:06:12.570> he<00:06:12.690> should<00:06:12.900> hopefully<00:06:13.110> sell
