00:01:36.040 --> 00:01:36.050 
wrong one pretty much do the same thing

00:01:36.050 --> 00:01:38.500 
wrong one pretty much do the same thing
but<00:01:36.080> my<00:01:36.740> friend<00:01:37.040> hair<00:01:37.190> scrambler<00:01:37.670> 48<00:01:38.120> was<00:01:38.330> on

00:01:38.500 --> 00:01:38.510 
but my friend hair scrambler 48 was on

00:01:38.510 --> 00:01:41.830 
but my friend hair scrambler 48 was on
the<00:01:38.600> other<00:01:38.630> team<00:01:38.840> and<00:01:39.320> I<00:01:39.830> was<00:01:40.550> like<00:01:40.790> and<00:01:41.390> he

00:01:41.830 --> 00:01:41.840 
the other team and I was like and he

00:01:41.840 --> 00:01:45.490 
the other team and I was like and he
planted<00:01:42.110> the<00:01:42.170> bomb<00:01:42.380> it<00:01:42.560> be<00:01:42.820> so<00:01:43.820> I<00:01:44.330> figured<00:01:45.200> I'd

00:01:45.490 --> 00:01:45.500 
planted the bomb it be so I figured I'd

00:01:45.500 --> 00:01:47.380 
planted the bomb it be so I figured I'd
just<00:01:45.680> run<00:01:45.920> straight<00:01:46.220> to<00:01:46.430> be<00:01:46.640> and<00:01:46.880> I<00:01:47.000> saw<00:01:47.210> this

00:01:47.380 --> 00:01:47.390 
just run straight to be and I saw this

00:01:47.390 --> 00:01:50.170 
just run straight to be and I saw this
guy<00:01:47.600> so<00:01:47.960> I<00:01:47.990> chasing<00:01:48.980> my<00:01:49.040> teammate<00:01:49.460> so<00:01:49.790> I<00:01:49.820> shot

00:01:50.170 --> 00:01:50.180 
guy so I chasing my teammate so I shot

00:01:50.180 --> 00:01:52.810 
guy so I chasing my teammate so I shot
him<00:01:50.390> and<00:01:50.600> then<00:01:50.630> got<00:01:50.960> a<00:01:51.470> head<00:01:51.650> shot<00:01:51.920> so<00:01:52.310> I<00:01:52.340> run

00:01:52.810 --> 00:01:52.820 
him and then got a head shot so I run

00:01:52.820 --> 00:01:54.430 
him and then got a head shot so I run
straight<00:01:53.360> to<00:01:53.390> because<00:01:53.930> I<00:01:54.020> noticed<00:01:54.350> that

00:01:54.430 --> 00:01:54.440 
straight to because I noticed that

00:01:54.440 --> 00:01:56.530 
straight to because I noticed that
there's<00:01:55.100> two<00:01:55.340> left<00:01:55.550> and<00:01:55.850> my<00:01:55.970> teammates<00:01:56.300> are

00:02:19.520 --> 00:02:19.530 
are shooting like a celebration on call

00:02:19.530 --> 00:02:26.500 
are shooting like a celebration on call
of<00:02:19.560> duty<00:02:19.860> because<00:02:20.330> everyone<00:02:21.330> does<00:02:21.510> that<00:02:21.569> Oh

00:02:26.500 --> 00:02:26.510 

00:02:26.510 --> 00:02:28.850 

like<00:02:27.510> I<00:02:27.629> said<00:02:27.690> before<00:02:27.959> I<00:02:28.200> do<00:02:28.290> the<00:02:28.500> same<00:02:28.530> thing

00:02:28.850 --> 00:02:28.860 
like I said before I do the same thing

00:02:28.860 --> 00:02:31.490 
like I said before I do the same thing
every<00:02:29.580> round<00:02:29.760> practically<00:02:30.300> except<00:02:31.260> from<00:02:31.349> when

00:02:31.490 --> 00:02:31.500 
every round practically except from when

00:02:31.500 --> 00:02:33.410 
every round practically except from when
i<00:02:31.530> switch<00:02:31.830> sides<00:02:32.099> because<00:02:32.340> i<00:02:32.519> obviously<00:02:32.700> can't

00:02:33.410 --> 00:02:33.420 
i switch sides because i obviously can't

00:02:33.420 --> 00:02:35.780 
i switch sides because i obviously can't
do<00:02:33.870> the<00:02:34.019> same<00:02:34.230> thing<00:02:34.500> i'm<00:02:35.040> pretty<00:02:35.400> sure<00:02:35.580> if<00:02:35.700> I

00:02:35.780 --> 00:02:35.790 
do the same thing i'm pretty sure if I

00:02:35.790 --> 00:02:37.070 
do the same thing i'm pretty sure if I
would<00:02:35.849> have<00:02:36.000> shot<00:02:36.060> that<00:02:36.420> guy<00:02:36.569> that<00:02:36.750> ran<00:02:36.900> by

00:02:37.070 --> 00:02:37.080 
would have shot that guy that ran by

00:02:37.080 --> 00:02:39.710 
would have shot that guy that ran by
real<00:02:37.319> fast<00:02:37.349> that<00:02:37.950> I<00:02:38.130> most<00:02:38.519> likely<00:02:39.060> what<00:02:39.690> I

00:02:39.710 --> 00:02:39.720 
real fast that I most likely what I

00:02:39.720 --> 00:02:40.910 
real fast that I most likely what I
gotta<00:02:39.930> hit<00:02:40.110> marker<00:02:40.470> because<00:02:40.620> I<00:02:40.680> would<00:02:40.830> have

00:02:40.910 --> 00:02:40.920 
gotta hit marker because I would have

00:02:40.920 --> 00:02:42.229 
gotta hit marker because I would have
shot<00:02:40.950> him<00:02:41.190> in<00:02:41.250> the<00:02:41.280> stomach<00:02:41.340> like<00:02:41.819> I<00:02:41.940> just<00:02:42.120> got

00:02:42.229 --> 00:02:42.239 
shot him in the stomach like I just got

00:02:42.239 --> 00:02:44.750 
shot him in the stomach like I just got
a<00:02:42.269> hit<00:02:42.390> marker<00:02:42.690> there<00:02:42.870> and<00:02:43.410> I<00:02:44.220> think<00:02:44.459> I<00:02:44.580> get

00:02:44.750 --> 00:02:44.760 
a hit marker there and I think I get

00:02:44.760 --> 00:02:48.080 
a hit marker there and I think I get
another<00:02:45.030> hit<00:02:45.239> marker<00:02:45.569> now<00:02:46.200> I<00:02:46.230> got<00:02:46.590> him<00:02:46.769> and<00:02:47.090> I'm

00:02:48.080 --> 00:02:48.090 
another hit marker now I got him and I'm

00:02:48.090 --> 00:02:50.449 
another hit marker now I got him and I'm
surprised<00:02:48.720> on<00:02:48.959> this<00:02:49.170> game<00:02:49.410> I<00:02:49.620> shoot<00:02:50.099> a<00:02:50.190> lot<00:02:50.310> of

00:02:50.449 --> 00:02:50.459 
surprised on this game I shoot a lot of

00:02:50.459 --> 00:02:53.000 
surprised on this game I shoot a lot of
people<00:02:50.730> above<00:02:50.940> their<00:02:51.150> shoulders<00:02:51.599> and<00:02:52.010> it

00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:53.010 
people above their shoulders and it

00:02:53.010 --> 00:02:55.339 
people above their shoulders and it
doesn't<00:02:53.370> seem<00:02:53.700> like<00:02:53.730> a<00:02:54.420> headshot<00:02:55.049> when<00:02:55.319> I

00:02:55.339 --> 00:02:55.349 
doesn't seem like a headshot when I

00:02:55.349 --> 00:03:00.890 
doesn't seem like a headshot when I
really<00:02:55.739> think<00:02:55.950> it<00:02:56.130> should<00:02:56.430> be<00:02:56.900> and<00:02:59.540> this<00:03:00.540> game

00:03:00.890 --> 00:03:00.900 
really think it should be and this game

00:03:00.900 --> 00:03:03.890 
really think it should be and this game
I<00:03:01.290> guess<00:03:01.890> I<00:03:02.069> did<00:03:02.220> pretty<00:03:02.400> well<00:03:02.549> i<00:03:02.880> was<00:03:03.840> gonna

00:03:03.890 --> 00:03:03.900 
I guess I did pretty well i was gonna

00:03:03.900 --> 00:03:06.440 
I guess I did pretty well i was gonna
record<00:03:04.319> again<00:03:04.650> but<00:03:05.040> after<00:03:05.760> this<00:03:05.880> game<00:03:06.060> i<00:03:06.269> like

00:03:06.440 --> 00:03:06.450 
record again but after this game i like

00:03:06.450 --> 00:03:08.360

commentary so therefore I'm 7 and 0 on
the<00:03:23.069> third<00:03:23.400> round<00:03:23.639> and<00:03:24.950> then<00:03:25.950> I'm<00:03:26.190> going<00:03:26.280> to

00:03:26.360 --> 00:03:26.370 
the third round and then I'm going to

00:03:26.370 --> 00:03:27.830 
the third round and then I'm going to
switch<00:03:26.609> sides<00:03:26.850> and<00:03:27.090> I<00:03:27.180> can't<00:03:27.420> do<00:03:27.510> the<00:03:27.630> same

00:03:27.830 --> 00:03:27.840 
switch sides and I can't do the same

00:03:27.840 --> 00:03:30.140 
switch sides and I can't do the same
thing<00:03:28.170> again<00:03:28.440> because<00:03:28.920> I'm<00:03:29.609> on<00:03:29.760> a<00:03:29.790> different

00:03:30.140 --> 00:03:30.150 
thing again because I'm on a different

00:03:30.150 --> 00:03:33.680 
thing again because I'm on a different
sign<00:03:30.329> so<00:03:31.260> I<00:03:31.290> figure<00:03:31.709> what<00:03:32.609> I<00:03:32.639> do<00:03:32.790> and<00:03:33.359> what<00:03:33.510> they

00:03:33.680 --> 00:03:33.690 
sign so I figure what I do and what they

00:03:33.690 --> 00:03:36.620 
sign so I figure what I do and what they
do<00:03:33.750> is<00:03:33.930> probably<00:03:34.530> similar<00:03:35.010> so<00:03:35.400> I<00:03:35.430> run<00:03:35.730> to<00:03:36.030> as<00:03:36.269> if

00:03:36.620 --> 00:03:36.630 
do is probably similar so I run to as if

00:03:36.630 --> 00:03:38.629 
do is probably similar so I run to as if
I<00:03:36.750> was<00:03:36.900> gonna<00:03:37.049> be<00:03:37.470> like<00:03:37.500> them<00:03:37.950> and<00:03:38.160> I'm<00:03:38.519> gonna

00:03:38.629 --> 00:03:38.639 
I was gonna be like them and I'm gonna

00:03:38.639 --> 00:03:41.449 
I was gonna be like them and I'm gonna
shoot<00:03:38.910> the<00:03:39.060> kids<00:03:39.350> that<00:03:40.350> I<00:03:40.650> would<00:03:41.160> think<00:03:41.370> that

00:03:41.449 --> 00:03:41.459 
shoot the kids that I would think that

00:03:41.459 --> 00:03:43.640 
shoot the kids that I would think that
would<00:03:41.670> be<00:03:41.790> there<00:03:41.970> like<00:03:42.180> I<00:03:42.389> would<00:03:42.569> be<00:03:42.750> and<00:03:43.350> I

00:03:43.640 --> 00:03:43.650 
would be there like I would be and I

00:03:43.650 --> 00:03:45.979 
would be there like I would be and I
actually<00:03:43.829> see<00:03:44.250> a<00:03:44.280> gunshot<00:03:44.819> and<00:03:45.000> I<00:03:45.359> get<00:03:45.569> back<00:03:45.750> in
