00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.200
 new man o man the avenues of butter that 

00:00:03.030 --> 00:00:05.490
 has no intro who has made a 

00:00:04.200 --> 00:00:08.099
 with a drawing in all rotten 

00:00:05.490 --> 00:00:09.120
 singing anything talaat a trawl 

00:00:08.099 --> 00:00:10.769
 and luhmann bellouti names find themselves 

00:00:09.120 --> 00:00:11.639
 for a pretty fast video it's for 

00:00:10.769 --> 00:00:13.290
 that you will not have gameplay 

00:00:11.639 --> 00:00:14.370
 behind but just a still image we're going 

00:00:13.290 --> 00:00:15.990
 talk about two things because I'm going 

00:00:14.370 --> 00:00:18.119
 a lot of questions on it we're going 

00:00:15.990 --> 00:00:19.710
 talk about linking access and 

00:00:18.119 --> 00:00:20.220
 the southwell app then to go out 

00:00:19.710 --> 00:00:22.050
 very soon 

00:00:20.220 --> 00:00:22.980
 so for concerning related access then he 

00:00:22.050 --> 00:00:24.300
 be aware that it is an exclusive 

00:00:22.980 --> 00:00:25.859
 xbox one what exactly is it 

00:00:24.300 --> 00:00:28.199
 so this is an application that is 

00:00:25.859 --> 00:00:29.820
 pay that allows you to play 

00:00:28.199 --> 00:00:32.550
 a few days before the release 

00:00:29.820 --> 00:00:33.809
 official of the game at fifa 2015 for because 

00:00:32.550 --> 00:00:35.880
 that we are interested in it is fifa but 

00:00:33.809 --> 00:00:38.160
 also to other games in the in 

00:00:35.880 --> 00:00:39.000
 the catalog of the dollie xbox one then 

00:00:38.160 --> 00:00:41.280
 how does it go if you want 

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:41.940
 enjoy this and paying 1 but if 

00:00:41.280 --> 00:00:43.230
 you want to enjoy it 

00:00:41.940 --> 00:00:43.950
 you go into the unique menu of oneself 

00:00:43.230 --> 00:00:47.129
 that you go to the applications menu 

00:00:43.950 --> 00:00:48.329
 you type i and thus access to ce2 s 

00:00:47.129 --> 00:00:49.950
 you'll see it's a kind of 

00:00:48.329 --> 00:00:51.210
 small applications with a logo 

00:00:49.950 --> 00:00:53.370
 internet a blue background they think themselves that 

00:00:51.210 --> 00:00:54.510
 it's accessible no to you 

00:00:53.370 --> 00:00:55.920
 download it once you have it 

00:00:54.510 --> 00:00:57.809
 years and you will see that you have the 

00:00:55.920 --> 00:00:59.430
 possibility to pay 25 euros for 

00:00:57.809 --> 00:01:00.840
 one year is 4 euros for one month 

00:00:59.430 --> 00:01:04.049
 and so as I say that allows you to 

00:01:00.840 --> 00:01:05.880
 play fifa 2015 with five days 

00:01:04.049 --> 00:01:07.650
 advanced to know on Saturday bring to the 

00:01:05.880 --> 00:01:09.150
 within the eee 20 September for a 

00:01:07.650 --> 00:01:09.960
 duration of 6 hours at the front it should be noted 

00:01:09.150 --> 00:01:11.159
 that's still it's for a 

00:01:09.960 --> 00:01:12.900
 limited time 

00:01:11.159 --> 00:01:14.189
 I do not think either that once 

00:01:12.900 --> 00:01:15.420
 you launched it on the six hours to 

00:01:14.189 --> 00:01:16.740
 following I think if you cut the 

00:01:15.420 --> 00:01:17.790
 console counting end stops 

00:01:16.740 --> 00:01:17.970
 I hope in any case we cross the 

00:01:17.790 --> 00:01:20.130
 fingers 

00:01:17.970 --> 00:01:21.869
 so what could be interesting 

00:01:20.130 --> 00:01:23.700
 is that ben voila you if you are 

00:01:21.869 --> 00:01:25.110
 really wildlife in fifa 2015 

00:01:23.700 --> 00:01:25.740
 a lot of simpler and more fifa 

00:01:25.110 --> 00:01:27.450
 2014 

00:01:25.740 --> 00:01:30.150
 you can relax a bit with 

00:01:27.450 --> 00:01:32.090
 a version is the version here it is 

00:01:30.150 --> 00:01:33.840
 to say final version 

00:01:32.090 --> 00:01:34.409
 after what are we going to say I think 

00:01:33.840 --> 00:01:36.150
 even though there would be some 

00:01:34.409 --> 00:01:37.590
 small apps and a few small ones 

00:01:36.150 --> 00:01:38.759
 patch patches that will be put to the 

00:01:37.590 --> 00:01:41.520
 release of fifa 2015 

00:01:38.759 --> 00:01:43.380
 it also allows you to have 10 % 

00:01:41.520 --> 00:01:45.570
 especially the then once you 

00:01:43.380 --> 00:01:46.770
 bought this app you have 10% 

00:01:45.570 --> 00:01:48.060
 discount on all products from 

00:01:46.770 --> 00:01:50.189
 martyrs to the elysée so I think if 

00:01:48.060 --> 00:01:51.540
 you buy fifa 2015 you have 10 % and 

00:01:50.189 --> 00:01:53.729
 you are also in the 10% 

00:01:51.540 --> 00:01:54.990
 on the points that annoy why I 

00:01:53.729 --> 00:01:56.820
 talk about fifa times is there so we go 

00:01:54.990 --> 00:01:57.659
 switch to the second topic where I 

00:01:56.820 --> 00:02:00.149
 had a lot of questions to know 

00:01:57.659 --> 00:02:01.770
 the future web application that will be 

00:02:00.149 --> 00:02:03.259
 officials from tomorrow so the 

00:02:01.770 --> 00:02:05.130
 know September 17th 

00:02:03.259 --> 00:02:06.149
 how is it going to take advantage of 

00:02:05.130 --> 00:02:07.789
 this application must be well 

00:02:06.149 --> 00:02:09.470
 obviously have an account origin 

00:02:07.789 --> 00:02:10.490
 so then you happen 

00:02:09.470 --> 00:02:12.110
 if you do not know how it is 

00:02:10.490 --> 00:02:16.090
 walk to you go on original yr 

00:02:12.110 --> 00:02:17.990
 erected im points like origin.com 

00:02:16.090 --> 00:02:19.400
 you will create an account that you 

00:02:17.990 --> 00:02:20.200
 will allow access to this 

00:02:19.400 --> 00:02:21.920
 application 

00:02:20.200 --> 00:02:23.330
 why this application because 

00:02:21.920 --> 00:02:24.410
 those who do not begin will tell me it serves 

00:02:23.330 --> 00:02:25.610
 nothing to go on the application seen 

00:02:24.410 --> 00:02:27.530
 that initially we do not have the game is everything 

00:02:25.610 --> 00:02:29.120
 as nay as if you already want 

00:02:27.530 --> 00:02:30.230
 make the purchase resale and open 

00:02:29.120 --> 00:02:32.210
 pacs on this application it takes 

00:02:30.230 --> 00:02:33.200
 go how is it going so so yes 

00:02:32.210 --> 00:02:35.720
 little question also that I often get 

00:02:33.200 --> 00:02:37.460
 can ask fifa 14 credits do not 

00:02:35.720 --> 00:02:38.750
 are not automatically transferred to 

00:02:37.460 --> 00:02:40.130
 fifa 15 to you do not you that you 

00:02:38.750 --> 00:02:40.550
 lose them is you stay on fifa 

00:02:40.130 --> 00:02:41.390
 14 

00:02:40.550 --> 00:02:42.380
 luckily by the way because those 

00:02:41.390 --> 00:02:43.880
 who have 50 million credits 

00:02:42.380 --> 00:02:44.780
 found at multi- millionaire games 

00:02:43.880 --> 00:02:46.850
 in chat credit 15 

00:02:44.780 --> 00:02:48.590
 on the other hand if you have fifa points 

00:02:46.850 --> 00:02:50.840
 they will automatically switch from 

00:02:48.590 --> 00:02:52.160
 super 14 to 2 fifa 2015 

00:02:50.840 --> 00:02:53.330
 so I too have a little advice to 

00:02:52.160 --> 00:02:56.240
 give you if you absolutely want 

00:02:53.330 --> 00:02:57.860
 buy fifa points for the fart 

00:02:56.240 --> 00:03:00.200
 packs when you open the app 

00:02:57.860 --> 00:03:01.459
 it is to take the yé access and then 

00:03:00.200 --> 00:03:03.230
 as you will have 10 % it will allow you 

00:03:01.459 --> 00:03:05.120
 to buy more for less is 

00:03:03.230 --> 00:03:06.950
 what am I going to do I think of you 

00:03:05.120 --> 00:03:08.540
 yes because you can not 

00:03:06.950 --> 00:03:09.950
 not buy fist fifa via 

00:03:08.540 --> 00:03:11.420
 the web application you can just 

00:03:09.950 --> 00:03:12.830
 package directly on with profits 

00:03:11.420 --> 00:03:14.239
 loud either if you do a little buying 

00:03:12.830 --> 00:03:15.709
 resale with gousserey credits made 

00:03:14.239 --> 00:03:16.940
 so this will be the best way for 

00:03:15.709 --> 00:03:18.260
 try to catch big players 

00:03:16.940 --> 00:03:19.880
 some little tips anyway 

00:03:18.260 --> 00:03:20.989
 about this application so me this 

00:03:19.880 --> 00:03:22.610
 that I advise you is that then I 

00:03:20.989 --> 00:03:25.010
 do not know if they will do that I know that 

00:03:22.610 --> 00:03:27.080
 usually according to your seniority 

00:03:25.010 --> 00:03:29.420
 your fidelity to fifa in quotation marks 

00:03:27.080 --> 00:03:30.350
 the day you the application will be 

00:03:29.420 --> 00:03:32.360
 launched you will have more or less 

00:03:30.350 --> 00:03:33.560
 easter that will be offered to you so already 

00:03:32.360 --> 00:03:35.660
 first bass board and open this 

00:03:33.560 --> 00:03:36.590
 is not that the maximum of all 

00:03:35.660 --> 00:03:38.420
 open up not to leave them under the 

00:03:36.590 --> 00:03:39.739
 elbow it's true that initially it's not 

00:03:38.420 --> 00:03:40.790
 great thing is the same after you 

00:03:39.739 --> 00:03:42.380
 will have the daily packs in what is it 

00:03:40.790 --> 00:03:43.670
 that's the second little advice 

00:03:42.380 --> 00:03:44.660
 uncle will see all the same 

00:03:43.670 --> 00:03:46.900
 days a little if there is not a small pack 

00:03:44.660 --> 00:03:49.280
 who drags it can be a bronze pack 

00:03:46.900 --> 00:03:50.239
 it makes this the beginning a strong challenge 

00:03:49.280 --> 00:03:51.290
 there is everything you have to take everything 

00:03:50.239 --> 00:03:52.790
 start you take a jersey a 

00:03:51.290 --> 00:03:53.720
 balloon a pair of godasses you him 

00:03:52.790 --> 00:03:55.489
 recovers everything stocks 

00:03:53.720 --> 00:03:56.450
 and then even in the packs bron ce 

00:03:55.489 --> 00:03:57.470
 power of fucking players what 

00:03:56.450 --> 00:03:59.299
 you have good players sivola 

00:03:57.470 --> 00:04:00.560
 equivalent by in the skin the skin of 

00:03:59.299 --> 00:04:01.940
 Gnaoua you money packs 

00:04:00.560 --> 00:04:03.140
 you also have gold packs and there 

00:04:01.940 --> 00:04:04.580
 on top also you necessarily have a 

00:04:03.140 --> 00:04:06.709
 English who will certainly touched 

00:04:04.580 --> 00:04:07.670
 ibrahimovic ronaldo if it's a small 

00:04:06.709 --> 00:04:08.600
 frenchy all the better for him 

00:04:07.670 --> 00:04:09.830
 always is it that you can touch 

00:04:08.600 --> 00:04:10.790
 with big players with packs 

00:04:09.830 --> 00:04:12.230
 free so I advise you to go there 

00:04:10.790 --> 00:04:13.970
 every day you also have about 

00:04:12.230 --> 00:04:16.040
 these free pack in quotation marks in 

00:04:13.970 --> 00:04:17.209
 that sense these everyday gifts the 

00:04:16.040 --> 00:04:19.200
 ability to recover credits 

00:04:17.209 --> 00:04:20.640
 directly know 250 credit 

00:04:19.200 --> 00:04:22.320
 where it can go up to 5000 credit 

00:04:20.640 --> 00:04:23.070
 5000 credit from a fifo is 

00:04:22.320 --> 00:04:25.740
 always good to take 

00:04:23.070 --> 00:04:27.570
 whose advice of which we have all the 

00:04:25.740 --> 00:04:29.160
 working days the bins from the start and 

00:04:27.570 --> 00:04:31.380
 at the level of resale buying so I do not 

00:04:29.160 --> 00:04:32.490
 am not a specialist of those of this 

00:04:31.380 --> 00:04:33.870
 operating mode 

00:04:32.490 --> 00:04:35.070
 what I would advise you to do 

00:04:33.870 --> 00:04:36.420
 it's the same I take my example 

00:04:35.070 --> 00:04:37.530
 staff last year sees in the 

00:04:36.420 --> 00:04:39.270
 best player I've seen in 

00:04:37.530 --> 00:04:40.860
 free passes and william the player of 

00:04:39.270 --> 00:04:42.870
 chelsea the brazilian what I had done 

00:04:40.860 --> 00:04:45.000
 these games have sold it directly via 

00:04:42.870 --> 00:04:45.210
 the application drops before leaving the 

00:04:45.000 --> 00:04:47.610
 Thu 

00:04:45.210 --> 00:04:49.560
 big mistake if you have a player who 

00:04:47.610 --> 00:04:52.260
 start to be not bad we will say little 

00:04:49.560 --> 00:04:53.970
 near 83.84 General will ask them 

00:04:52.260 --> 00:04:55.590
 especially not before the game's release 

00:04:53.970 --> 00:04:56.640
 why because at the beginning the guys 

00:04:55.590 --> 00:04:57.750
 europe had a lot of credit so 

00:04:56.640 --> 00:04:59.460
 necessarily if you buy it is going to be 

00:04:57.750 --> 00:05:00.600
 for them it'll be for a sum not 

00:04:59.460 --> 00:05:02.190
 derisory but that will be much less 

00:05:00.600 --> 00:05:03.360
 important that at the exit of the game sees 

00:05:02.190 --> 00:05:04.470
 for example williams I had sold I 

00:05:03.360 --> 00:05:06.480
 think it was 12 or 13 miles 

00:05:04.470 --> 00:05:07.950
 during before the game comes out and at 

00:05:06.480 --> 00:05:08.850
 the release of fifa com there are all 

00:05:07.950 --> 00:05:09.420
 players must necessarily everyone 

00:05:08.850 --> 00:05:10.650
 must do it 

00:05:09.420 --> 00:05:11.790
 everyone will start making some 

00:05:10.650 --> 00:05:12.930
 offers necessarily it will fight for 

00:05:11.790 --> 00:05:14.850
 trying to catch the player is so the 

00:05:12.930 --> 00:05:16.110
 auctions will go up and the william I 

00:05:14.850 --> 00:05:17.280
 believe that all fears the year 

00:05:16.110 --> 00:05:18.540
 last this figure to 14 he carried to 

00:05:17.280 --> 00:05:21.420
 adventures of the 40000 so I had made myself 

00:05:18.540 --> 00:05:22.290
 a little bit of 30000 credit this 

00:05:21.420 --> 00:05:23.730
 that I advise you against it 

00:05:22.290 --> 00:05:25.380
 to make the resale purchase with the 

00:05:23.730 --> 00:05:26.760
 players not mean but with stats 

00:05:25.380 --> 00:05:28.830
 correct but not worth 

00:05:26.760 --> 00:05:31.950
 excessively expensive if you have any 

00:05:28.830 --> 00:05:33.690
 players who I think he will feel it 

00:05:31.950 --> 00:05:35.280
 even 2000 credit to you will see with 

00:05:33.690 --> 00:05:36.180
 complete stats you can succeed at 

00:05:35.280 --> 00:05:38.160
 make resale purchase 

00:05:36.180 --> 00:05:38.970
 and then make a small profit that 

00:05:38.160 --> 00:05:41.030
 could be nice if you 

00:05:38.970 --> 00:05:43.080
 will open either packs or 2 

00:05:41.030 --> 00:05:44.190
 to buy players if you want 

00:05:43.080 --> 00:05:46.290
 also make the purchase resale and 

00:05:44.190 --> 00:05:47.670
 to rely on players is like 

00:05:46.290 --> 00:05:49.230
 I say it's advice after I know 

00:05:47.670 --> 00:05:50.130
 not a specialist either but 

00:05:49.230 --> 00:05:53.070
 returning players 

00:05:50.130 --> 00:05:55.140
 characteristics a bit specific to 

00:05:53.070 --> 00:05:57.390
 to know hat is super super super 

00:05:55.140 --> 00:05:58.470
 beefy style is finally for you 

00:05:57.390 --> 00:05:59.670
 see the beefiest players you 

00:05:58.470 --> 00:06:01.080
 go on leak is to type you some 

00:05:59.670 --> 00:06:02.700
 characteristics that are in great demand 

00:06:01.080 --> 00:06:04.370
 I think this year the physical 

00:06:02.700 --> 00:06:05.720
 from what I was told from the 

00:06:04.370 --> 00:06:07.850
 youtube I have with whom I could 

00:06:05.720 --> 00:06:09.050
 discuss who tested fifa 2015 in 

00:06:07.850 --> 00:06:10.340
 advance the physical will be very important 

00:06:09.050 --> 00:06:11.900
 so it's beating big players 

00:06:10.340 --> 00:06:12.650
 try to play to buy players 

00:06:11.900 --> 00:06:13.729
 offensive 

00:06:12.650 --> 00:06:14.930
 it is true that the defensive players have 

00:06:13.729 --> 00:06:17.180
 tend to sell a little cheaper 

00:06:14.930 --> 00:06:18.590
 and so especially if you really have 

00:06:17.180 --> 00:06:20.330
 a lot of credit is to buy the 

00:06:18.590 --> 00:06:21.530
 maximum you store the manes 

00:06:20.330 --> 00:06:22.820
 maximum you buy a big fat 

00:06:21.530 --> 00:06:25.460
 players you will see that at the exit 

00:06:22.820 --> 00:06:27.050
 of the game this player will increase so 

00:06:25.460 --> 00:06:28.010
 exponential and you're going to be doing yourself 

00:06:27.050 --> 00:06:29.720
 a damn profit you're getting 

00:06:28.010 --> 00:06:32.360
 will then open a few 

00:06:29.720 --> 00:06:34.400
 packs was listening to me I think we all 

00:06:32.360 --> 00:06:36.020
 says if we can quickly recap 

00:06:34.400 --> 00:06:37.370
 in which is access you have the game 6 

00:06:36.020 --> 00:06:38.900
 hours for a duration of 6 hours but 

00:06:37.370 --> 00:06:40.460
 with five days advanced against 

00:06:38.900 --> 00:06:43.060
 it pays to 4 euros month or 25 euros 

00:06:40.460 --> 00:06:45.169
 year round if you want to buy 

00:06:43.060 --> 00:06:47.060
 points needed so the fifa points do not 

00:06:45.169 --> 00:06:48.560
 are automatic will automatically 

00:06:47.060 --> 00:06:50.150
 backed dufay 14h fifa 15 

00:06:48.560 --> 00:06:52.760
 however, credits will remain on 

00:06:50.150 --> 00:06:54.080
 the fifa 14 went to see the packs every 

00:06:52.760 --> 00:06:55.400
 days and if you make the purchase 

00:06:54.080 --> 00:06:56.780
 resale avoid reselling your fat 

00:06:55.400 --> 00:06:58.220
 players before the release of the game wait 

00:06:56.780 --> 00:06:59.300
 the exit of the game and the average players 

00:06:58.220 --> 00:07:00.229
 enjoy yourself to try 

00:06:59.300 --> 00:07:01.430
 to accumulate a maximum of benefits 

00:07:00.229 --> 00:07:02.780
 here I hope their time is 

00:07:01.430 --> 00:07:03.139
 produces a few calves all your 

00:07:02.780 --> 00:07:04.460
