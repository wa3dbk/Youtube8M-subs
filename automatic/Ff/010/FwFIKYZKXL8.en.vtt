 2000 and France since 1830 

00:00:03.529 --> 00:00:09.330
 alas this volume ould biye and last maul 

00:00:07.200 --> 00:00:11.730
 flexible banknotes are unique in the world 

00:00:09.330 --> 00:00:13.380
 their material was developed by the 

00:00:11.730 --> 00:00:15.330
 internal design office and the 

00:00:13.380 --> 00:00:17.670
 ticket laboratories 

00:00:15.330 --> 00:00:19.680
 the silicone foam alloy and 

00:00:17.670 --> 00:00:21.570
 guaranteed metal powder without peroxide 

00:00:19.680 --> 00:00:24.689
 and this by getting up gives these products 

00:00:21.570 --> 00:00:26.490
 high-end performance for a 

00:00:24.689 --> 00:00:29.640
 superior to other molds 

00:00:26.490 --> 00:00:31.500
 Flexible and rigid patented is manufactured 

00:00:29.640 --> 00:00:33.840
 in France they come from a 

00:00:31.500 --> 00:00:35.610
 advanced technology their materials 

00:00:33.840 --> 00:00:38.969
 perfectly transmits heat as 

00:00:35.610 --> 00:00:42.270
 cold from minus 70 degrees to +3,100 

00:00:38.969 --> 00:00:45.809
 degrees celsius or minus 90 degrees to 

00:00:42.270 --> 00:00:48.300
 plus 5 180 degrees fahrenheit the points 

00:00:45.809 --> 00:00:52.289
 strong of our elasto mussels are a 

00:00:48.300 --> 00:00:57.120
 homogeneous cooking of many forms 

00:00:52.289 --> 00:00:58.890
 sharp angles naturally anti 

00:00:57.120 --> 00:01:02.010
 adhesive for a mold release does it pass 

00:00:58.890 --> 00:01:04.260
 without breakage or products that attaches a 

00:01:02.010 --> 00:01:06.540
 easy maintenance and storage 

00:01:04.260 --> 00:01:08.970
 a caramelization perfectly 

00:01:06.540 --> 00:01:11.189
 identical above and below 

00:01:08.970 --> 00:01:14.750
 in comparison with a standard mold 

00:01:11.189 --> 00:01:14.750
 here is the difference 

00:01:15.890 --> 00:01:20.290
 a high-end product made in 

00:01:18.050 --> 00:01:22.400
 France is unique in the world 

00:01:20.290 --> 00:01:24.110
 accredited by the best workers of 

00:01:22.400 --> 00:01:26.690
 France and World Champion 

00:01:24.110 --> 00:01:29.090
 pastry recipe card is offered 

00:01:26.690 --> 00:01:32.090
 by mold here are some of these 

00:01:29.090 --> 00:01:34.190
 virtuosos of pastry use 

00:01:32.090 --> 00:01:34.700
 put the mold on a rack and not on 

00:01:34.190 --> 00:01:36.619
 a plate 

00:01:34.700 --> 00:01:38.060
 unless it is perforated for a 

00:01:36.619 --> 00:01:41.090
 better convection of heat 

00:01:38.060 --> 00:01:43.600
 grease only slightly before 

00:01:41.090 --> 00:01:43.600
 first use 

00:01:48.710 --> 00:01:52.020
 never put in the oven with 

00:01:51.180 --> 00:01:53.640
 empty spaces 

00:01:52.020 --> 00:01:56.070
 simply add a drop of oil 

00:01:53.640 --> 00:01:58.130
 in empty alveoli to feed the 

00:01:56.070 --> 00:02:00.630
 mold and prevent it from drying out 

00:01:58.130 --> 00:02:02.670
 be careful never use the 

00:02:00.630 --> 00:02:04.979
 krill resistance because infrared 

00:02:02.670 --> 00:02:08.750
 could damage the mold and for 

00:02:04.979 --> 00:02:08.750
 finish mussels and with ease 

00:02:12.490 --> 00:02:17.680
 some molds have the r system 

00:02:14.620 --> 00:02:19.000
 patented system of perforations are 

00:02:17.680 --> 00:02:20.590
 located between the different 

00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:22.120
 footprints of the plate for a 

00:02:20.590 --> 00:02:24.100
 better circulation of heat and 

00:02:22.120 --> 00:02:25.720
 cold for perfect cooking 

00:02:24.100 --> 00:02:28.420
 regular and homogeneous throughout the 

00:02:25.720 --> 00:02:30.220
 plate and a better course results from 

00:02:28.420 --> 00:02:32.620
 the regularity of cooking and the 

00:02:30.220 --> 00:02:35.740
 caramelization product presentation 

00:02:32.620 --> 00:02:38.280
 made with the and last maul endowed with the r 

00:02:35.740 --> 00:02:38.280
 systems 

00:02:45.290 --> 00:02:48.280
 Yes 

00:03:01.300 --> 00:03:04.900
 for a better result than with 

00:03:03.220 --> 00:03:07.180
 traditional flexible or rigid molds 

00:03:04.900 --> 00:03:09.540
