00:00:06.420 --> 00:00:06.430 
this is part three video series about

00:00:06.430 --> 00:00:08.940 
this is part three video series about
filters<00:00:07.270> and<00:00:07.569> today<00:00:08.170> we<00:00:08.410> will<00:00:08.530> be<00:00:08.710> talking

00:00:08.940 --> 00:00:08.950 
filters and today we will be talking

00:00:08.950 --> 00:00:13.140 
filters and today we will be talking
about<00:00:09.570> polarizers<00:00:10.570> or<00:00:11.469> polarizing<00:00:12.400> filters

00:00:13.140 --> 00:00:13.150 
about polarizers or polarizing filters

00:00:13.150 --> 00:00:16.529 
about polarizers or polarizing filters
what<00:00:13.750> they<00:00:13.959> are<00:00:14.230> how<00:00:14.889> to<00:00:14.949> use<00:00:15.520> them<00:00:15.760> in<00:00:15.910> wet<00:00:16.180> and

00:00:16.529 --> 00:00:16.539 
what they are how to use them in wet and

00:00:16.539 --> 00:00:18.990 
what they are how to use them in wet and
also<00:00:17.199> what<00:00:17.470> kind<00:00:17.890> of<00:00:18.010> challenges<00:00:18.609> you<00:00:18.790> might

00:00:18.990 --> 00:00:19.000 
also what kind of challenges you might

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:23.070 
also what kind of challenges you might
run<00:00:19.270> into<00:00:19.870> while<00:00:20.320> using<00:00:20.800> polarizers<00:00:21.810> first<00:00:22.810> of

00:00:23.070 --> 00:00:23.080 
run into while using polarizers first of

00:00:23.080 --> 00:00:25.860 
run into while using polarizers first of
all<00:00:23.260> polarizing<00:00:24.250> filters<00:00:24.820> consist<00:00:25.390> out<00:00:25.600> of

00:00:25.860 --> 00:00:25.870 
all polarizing filters consist out of

00:00:25.870 --> 00:00:28.320 
all polarizing filters consist out of
two<00:00:26.230> pieces<00:00:26.470> of<00:00:26.770> glass<00:00:27.070> which<00:00:27.730> you<00:00:27.760> rotate

00:00:28.320 --> 00:00:28.330 
two pieces of glass which you rotate

00:00:28.330 --> 00:00:31.490 
two pieces of glass which you rotate
against<00:00:29.050> each<00:00:29.200> other<00:00:29.500> to<00:00:30.160> get<00:00:30.369> different

00:00:31.490 --> 00:00:31.500 
against each other to get different

00:00:31.500 --> 00:00:37.410 
against each other to get different
polarization<00:00:32.500> effect<00:00:32.920> together<00:00:36.239> there<00:00:37.239> are

00:00:37.410 --> 00:00:37.420 
polarization effect together there are

00:00:37.420 --> 00:00:40.560 
polarization effect together there are
two<00:00:37.690> types<00:00:38.020> of<00:00:38.380> polarizers<00:00:39.040> and<00:00:39.700> those<00:00:40.239> are

00:00:40.560 --> 00:00:40.570 
two types of polarizers and those are

00:00:40.570 --> 00:00:45.000 
two types of polarizers and those are
linear<00:00:40.840> and<00:00:41.320> circular<00:00:42.070> polarizers<00:00:43.680> both<00:00:44.680> are

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:45.010 
linear and circular polarizers both are

00:00:45.010 --> 00:00:47.549 
linear and circular polarizers both are
very<00:00:45.190> similar<00:00:45.550> in<00:00:45.940> terms<00:00:46.000> of<00:00:46.540> the<00:00:46.690> effect<00:00:47.320> they

00:00:47.549 --> 00:00:47.559 
very similar in terms of the effect they

00:00:47.559 --> 00:00:50.940 
very similar in terms of the effect they
give<00:00:47.890> but<00:00:48.670> linear<00:00:49.210> polarizers<00:00:49.680> cannot<00:00:50.680> be

00:00:50.940 --> 00:00:50.950 
give but linear polarizers cannot be

00:00:50.950 --> 00:00:53.040 
give but linear polarizers cannot be
used<00:00:51.220> with<00:00:51.489> cameras<00:00:51.970> would<00:00:52.270> have<00:00:52.540> a<00:00:52.750> through

00:00:53.040 --> 00:00:53.050 
used with cameras would have a through

00:00:53.050 --> 00:00:56.040 
used with cameras would have a through
the<00:00:53.079> lens<00:00:53.440> metering<00:00:53.829> system<00:00:54.610> or<00:00:54.790> out<00:00:55.390> of<00:00:55.840> focus

00:00:56.040 --> 00:00:56.050 
the lens metering system or out of focus

00:00:56.050 --> 00:01:00.360 
the lens metering system or out of focus
so<00:00:56.860> most<00:00:57.399> of<00:00:57.670> modern<00:00:57.910> cameras<00:00:58.780> will<00:00:59.380> require<00:00:59.950> a

00:01:00.360 --> 00:01:00.370 
so most of modern cameras will require a

00:01:00.370 --> 00:01:03.000 
so most of modern cameras will require a
circular<00:01:00.969> polarizer<00:01:01.710> linear<00:01:02.710> polarizers

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:03.010 
circular polarizer linear polarizers

00:01:03.010 --> 00:01:06.060 
circular polarizer linear polarizers
were<00:01:03.730> more<00:01:04.030> used<00:01:04.329> back<00:01:04.989> in<00:01:05.019> the<00:01:05.229> days<00:01:05.500> when<00:01:05.920> we

00:01:06.060 --> 00:01:06.070 
were more used back in the days when we

00:01:06.070 --> 00:01:10.020 
were more used back in the days when we
had<00:01:06.250> a<00:01:06.280> film<00:01:06.700> cameras<00:01:08.310> polarizers<00:01:09.310> are<00:01:09.819> very

00:01:10.020 --> 00:01:10.030 
had a film cameras polarizers are very

00:01:10.030 --> 00:01:12.590 
had a film cameras polarizers are very
often<00:01:10.299> used<00:01:10.600> in<00:01:11.229> landscape<00:01:12.159> photography

00:01:12.590 --> 00:01:12.600 
often used in landscape photography

00:01:12.600 --> 00:01:16.139 
often used in landscape photography
because<00:01:13.600> they<00:01:13.929> have<00:01:14.200> an<00:01:14.380> ability<00:01:14.679> to<00:01:15.100> make<00:01:15.759> the

because they have an ability to make the

00:01:16.149 --> 00:01:20.669 
because they have an ability to make the
sky<00:01:16.649> darker<00:01:17.649> and<00:01:17.889> more<00:01:18.240> saturated<00:01:19.439> they<00:01:20.439> can

00:01:20.669 --> 00:01:20.679 
sky darker and more saturated they can

00:01:20.679 --> 00:01:22.830 
sky darker and more saturated they can
also<00:01:20.920> affect<00:01:21.520> other<00:01:21.789> colors<00:01:22.420> in<00:01:22.659> the<00:01:22.689> image

wasn't able to remove them completely I
guess<00:02:53.840> it<00:02:54.050> depends<00:02:54.470> on<00:02:54.739> how<00:02:55.010> strong<00:02:55.550> the

00:02:56.520 --> 00:02:56.530 
guess it depends on how strong the

guess it depends on how strong the
reflections<00:02:57.530> are<00:02:58.360> you<00:02:59.360> can<00:02:59.570> also<00:02:59.840> remove<00:03:00.170> some

00:03:00.550 --> 00:03:00.560 
reflections are you can also remove some

00:03:00.560 --> 00:03:04.449 
reflections are you can also remove some
reflections<00:03:01.220> from<00:03:01.520> the<00:03:01.670> glass<00:03:02.200> or<00:03:03.250> even<00:03:04.250> when

00:03:04.449 --> 00:03:04.459 
reflections from the glass or even when

00:03:04.459 --> 00:03:06.790 
reflections from the glass or even when
you<00:03:04.610> take<00:03:04.820> in<00:03:05.030> pictures<00:03:05.600> through<00:03:06.140> the<00:03:06.320> window

00:03:06.790 --> 00:03:06.800 
you take in pictures through the window

00:03:06.800 --> 00:03:08.260 
you take in pictures through the window
sometimes<00:03:07.130> when<00:03:07.459> you<00:03:07.550> take<00:03:07.760> a<00:03:07.790> picture

00:03:08.260 --> 00:03:08.270 
sometimes when you take a picture

00:03:08.270 --> 00:03:10.180 
sometimes when you take a picture
through<00:03:08.480> the<00:03:08.660> window<00:03:09.050> you<00:03:09.110> get<00:03:09.350> a<00:03:09.380> reflection

00:03:10.180 --> 00:03:10.190 
through the window you get a reflection

00:03:10.190 --> 00:03:12.970 
through the window you get a reflection
and<00:03:10.400> the<00:03:11.090> polarizer<00:03:11.600> can<00:03:12.020> help<00:03:12.320> to<00:03:12.709> remove

00:03:12.970 --> 00:03:12.980 
and the polarizer can help to remove

00:03:12.980 --> 00:03:16.470 
and the polarizer can help to remove

reflections<00:03:24.860> from<00:03:25.549> the<00:03:25.640> water<00:03:25.970> so<00:03:26.600> you<00:03:26.660> can

00:03:27.009 --> 00:03:27.019 
reflections from the water so you can

some sample pictures of the lake but

00:03:34.970 --> 00:03:37.570 
some sample pictures of the lake but

filter<00:03:37.730> will<00:03:38.450> help<00:03:38.720> it<00:03:38.959> so<00:03:39.500> I<00:03:39.799> just<00:03:40.190> had<00:03:40.370> to<00:03:40.549> get

00:03:40.690 --> 00:03:40.700 
filter will help it so I just had to get

creative in the bathtub this photo was

00:03:44.120 --> 00:03:46.660 
creative in the bathtub this photo was
created<00:03:44.660> without<00:03:44.810> polarizer<00:03:45.799> and<00:03:46.250> you<00:03:46.459> can

00:03:46.660 --> 00:03:46.670 
created without polarizer and you can

00:03:46.670 --> 00:03:49.360 
created without polarizer and you can
see<00:03:46.850> reflections<00:03:47.329> in<00:03:47.720> the<00:03:47.750> water<00:03:47.870> and<00:03:48.829> this

00:03:49.360 --> 00:03:49.370 
see reflections in the water and this

00:03:49.370 --> 00:03:52.630 
see reflections in the water and this
one<00:03:49.640> was<00:03:49.910> with<00:03:50.209> polarizer<00:03:50.989> and<00:03:51.620> you<00:03:52.190> can<00:03:52.400> see

00:03:52.630 --> 00:03:52.640 
one was with polarizer and you can see

00:03:52.640 --> 00:03:56.949 
one was with polarizer and you can see
clear<00:03:53.120> through<00:03:53.510> it<00:03:55.090> polarizers<00:03:56.090> are<00:03:56.630> also

00:03:56.949 --> 00:03:56.959 
clear through it polarizers are also

00:03:56.959 --> 00:04:00.520 
clear through it polarizers are also
called<00:03:57.590> Poorman<00:03:58.400> and<00:03:58.730> D<00:03:58.970> filters<00:03:59.540> because

00:04:00.520 --> 00:04:00.530 
called Poorman and D filters because

00:04:00.530 --> 00:04:04.000 
called Poorman and D filters because
they<00:04:01.250> are<00:04:01.459> able<00:04:01.670> to<00:04:01.910> act<00:04:02.299> as<00:04:02.660> ND<00:04:03.110> filter<00:04:03.709> and

00:04:04.000 --> 00:04:04.010 
they are able to act as ND filter and

my previous video you will know how nd
filters<00:04:14.360> are<00:04:14.660> used<00:04:16.510> so<00:04:17.510> you<00:04:17.570> will<00:04:17.959> have<00:04:18.200> to

00:04:18.460 --> 00:04:18.470 
filters are used so you will have to

00:04:18.470 --> 00:04:21.159 
filters are used so you will have to
keep<00:04:18.709> in<00:04:18.950> mind<00:04:18.979> that<00:04:19.880> you<00:04:20.150> will<00:04:20.419> lose<00:04:20.780> some

put<00:05:51.530> polarizer<00:05:52.430> on<00:05:59.740> you<00:06:00.740> could<00:06:01.040> try<00:06:01.430> also<00:06:01.910> to

00:06:02.230 --> 00:06:02.240 
put polarizer on you could try also to

00:06:02.240 --> 00:06:05.080 
put polarizer on you could try also to

the rainbow of course if you find one

the rainbow of course if you find one
the<00:06:08.330> reason<00:06:08.720> why<00:06:08.900> I<00:06:09.320> didn't<00:06:10.130> include<00:06:10.490> it<00:06:10.640> in<00:06:10.730> my

00:06:10.870 --> 00:06:10.880 
the reason why I didn't include it in my

00:06:10.880 --> 00:06:13.180 
the reason why I didn't include it in my
video<00:06:11.030> is<00:06:11.390> because<00:06:11.840> I<00:06:12.140> didn't<00:06:12.770> find<00:06:12.950> the

00:06:13.180 --> 00:06:13.190 
video is because I didn't find the

00:06:13.190 --> 00:06:14.920 
video is because I didn't find the
rainbow<00:06:13.580> to<00:06:13.640> shoot<00:06:14.030> because<00:06:14.390> it's<00:06:14.570> almost

00:06:14.920 --> 00:06:14.930 
rainbow to shoot because it's almost

00:06:14.930 --> 00:06:19.120 
rainbow to shoot because it's almost
never<00:06:15.350> ran<00:06:15.770> since<00:06:16.040> house<00:06:16.600> California<00:06:17.890> but<00:06:18.890> I

00:06:19.120 --> 00:06:19.130 
never ran since house California but I

00:06:19.130 --> 00:06:21.400 
never ran since house California but I
did<00:06:19.310> my<00:06:19.490> research<00:06:19.700> and<00:06:20.300> some<00:06:20.720> people<00:06:21.140> say<00:06:21.380> that

00:06:21.400 --> 00:06:21.410 
did my research and some people say that

00:06:21.410 --> 00:06:24.530 
did my research and some people say that
you<00:06:22.370> should<00:06:22.400> use<00:06:22.940> polarizer<00:06:23.690> was<00:06:24.050> arranged

00:06:24.530 --> 00:06:24.540 
you should use polarizer was arranged

00:06:24.540 --> 00:06:26.720 
you should use polarizer was arranged
because<00:06:24.870> it<00:06:25.020> can<00:06:25.260> enhance<00:06:25.740> it<00:06:26.010> and<00:06:26.160> other

00:06:26.720 --> 00:06:26.730 
because it can enhance it and other

00:06:26.730 --> 00:06:29.060 
because it can enhance it and other
people<00:06:26.910> say<00:06:27.600> no<00:06:27.960> you<00:06:28.020> should<00:06:28.530> never<00:06:28.830> use

00:06:29.060 --> 00:06:29.070 
people say no you should never use

00:06:29.070 --> 00:06:31.520 
people say no you should never use
polarizer<00:06:29.760> with<00:06:30.030> rainbow<00:06:30.510> because<00:06:30.960> it<00:06:31.260> can

00:06:31.520 --> 00:06:31.530 
polarizer with rainbow because it can

00:06:31.530 --> 00:06:34.700 
polarizer with rainbow because it can
make<00:06:31.800> it<00:06:32.040> disappear<00:06:32.480> so<00:06:33.480> what<00:06:33.780> is<00:06:33.930> truth<00:06:34.380> I

00:06:34.700 --> 00:06:34.710 
make it disappear so what is truth I

00:06:34.710 --> 00:06:37.000 
make it disappear so what is truth I
think<00:06:35.160> it<00:06:35.610> probably<00:06:35.880> can<00:06:36.300> go<00:06:36.450> both<00:06:36.810> ways

00:06:37.000 --> 00:06:37.010 
think it probably can go both ways

00:06:37.010 --> 00:06:40.010 
think it probably can go both ways
depending<00:06:38.010> how<00:06:38.160> you<00:06:38.190> rotate<00:06:38.790> polarizer<00:06:39.510> and

00:06:40.010 --> 00:06:40.020 
depending how you rotate polarizer and

00:06:40.020 --> 00:06:43.010 
depending how you rotate polarizer and
which<00:06:40.530> angle<00:06:41.460> you<00:06:41.610> add<00:06:41.910> but<00:06:42.270> I<00:06:42.300> wanted<00:06:42.750> to<00:06:42.870> ask

00:06:43.010 --> 00:06:43.020 
which angle you add but I wanted to ask

00:06:43.020 --> 00:06:46.910 
which angle you add but I wanted to ask
you<00:06:43.500> if<00:06:43.890> any<00:06:44.340> of<00:06:44.580> you<00:06:45.050> got<00:06:46.050> a<00:06:46.110> chance<00:06:46.440> to<00:06:46.650> take

you if any of you got a chance to take

00:06:46.920 --> 00:06:49.220 
you if any of you got a chance to take
