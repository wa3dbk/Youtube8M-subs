00:00:09.379 --> 00:00:14.160
 the staff if we were not here in the 

00:00:12.059 --> 00:00:16.289
 hypochondria novels studio people 

00:00:14.160 --> 00:00:17.940
 start now but infolab responds 

00:00:16.289 --> 00:00:20.369
 Let's talk a little bit since we 

00:00:17.940 --> 00:00:22.860
 told the screen of the lg g 4 then speak one 

00:00:20.369 --> 00:00:24.510
 camera or at the request of the 

00:00:22.860 --> 00:00:25.650
 helio filipe de oliveira who asked the 

00:00:24.510 --> 00:00:29.789
 our video on the plastic screen 

00:00:25.650 --> 00:00:31.170
 train boxing also looking to elect 4 

00:00:29.789 --> 00:00:33.660
 where else has it been that it is more powerful 

00:00:31.170 --> 00:00:35.760
 has different milk opening than 

00:00:33.660 --> 00:00:38.550
 Any one of them differential to another 

00:00:35.760 --> 00:00:41.100
 yesterday several things there with a 

00:00:38.550 --> 00:00:42.960
 marketing issue he ends up focusing on 

00:00:41.100 --> 00:00:45.839
 enough numbers however example 

00:00:42.960 --> 00:00:49.769
 informs that the lens aperture of the g 

00:00:45.839 --> 00:00:52.440
 4 which is of 18 is greater than f 1 9 

00:00:49.769 --> 00:00:55.559
 of the cats and six of us is the 

00:00:52.440 --> 00:00:57.479
 best mobile camera at the moment 

00:00:55.559 --> 00:00:58.739
 that's a worthwhile thing there 

00:00:57.479 --> 00:01:01.079
 demystify a little because it is the 

00:00:58.739 --> 00:01:04.229
 Next thread in lecce is one thing 

00:01:01.079 --> 00:01:06.780
 relative and is what is the ratio between the 

00:01:04.229 --> 00:01:09.540
 lens focal length and open the lens 

00:01:06.780 --> 00:01:11.549
 absolute diameter of the aperture or 

00:01:09.540 --> 00:01:14.460
 you are with a lens designed by a 

00:01:11.549 --> 00:01:16.560
 smaller sensor is going to look like 

00:01:14.460 --> 00:01:20.189
 it has a very large opening but 

00:01:16.560 --> 00:01:21.930
 sfs even f-18 of g 4 and a camera 35 

00:01:20.189 --> 00:01:23.340
 millimeters and so a hole in the 

00:01:21.930 --> 00:01:25.500
 customers is not from today 

00:01:23.340 --> 00:01:27.180
 the cold and famine also explained to me 

00:01:25.500 --> 00:01:29.250
 that the issue was not through the lens of 

00:01:27.180 --> 00:01:30.840
 professional camera of this size 

00:01:29.250 --> 00:01:32.100
 the milk bank can be great too 

00:01:30.840 --> 00:01:35.159
 but proportionately it will be very 

00:01:32.100 --> 00:01:38.009
 as well as other there will be 4 g 

00:01:35.159 --> 00:01:39.899
 bigger than she's not like that but she's good and 

00:01:38.009 --> 00:01:41.159
 it is also worth mentioning that 

00:01:39.899 --> 00:01:42.899
 a large aperture not necessarily 

00:01:41.159 --> 00:01:44.640
 translate into better quality of 

00:01:42.899 --> 00:01:46.619
 image you will be able to take more pictures 

00:01:44.640 --> 00:01:49.140
 light conditions in dark environments but 

00:01:46.619 --> 00:01:51.030
 also opens the biggest aberration 

00:01:49.140 --> 00:01:56.170
 chromatic this kind of thing 

00:01:51.030 --> 00:01:58.869
 also the difference between 0.1 

00:01:56.170 --> 00:02:01.509
 a faith came to less than half stock 

00:01:58.869 --> 00:02:04.240
 so it 's a little something that's worth it 

00:02:01.509 --> 00:02:05.799
 also coming back on this issue he people 

00:02:04.240 --> 00:02:08.709
 here is enough sensor size 

00:02:05.799 --> 00:02:13.350
 resolution of 16 megapixels exactly 

00:02:08.709 --> 00:02:17.980
 same size of samsung that is crime by 

00:02:13.350 --> 00:02:20.230
 2.2 train in by two is the almost one per 

00:02:17.980 --> 00:02:22.239
 10.3 a bit smaller than the cameras 

00:02:20.230 --> 00:02:24.970
 that there are several other 

00:02:22.239 --> 00:02:27.340
 that the largest census as 

00:02:24.970 --> 00:02:32.200
 those of sony the spiritists or the own 

00:02:27.340 --> 00:02:34.780
 profile of a microsoft bar and nokia 

00:02:32.200 --> 00:02:37.810
 also that issue is that the size of the 

00:02:34.780 --> 00:02:39.489
 sensor matters when your resolution is 

00:02:37.810 --> 00:02:40.900
 somewhat compatible with this size 

00:02:39.489 --> 00:02:42.940
 leaving the individual pixels 

00:02:40.900 --> 00:02:44.860
 get big 

00:02:42.940 --> 00:02:47.680
 in this case he has already tied with 

00:02:44.860 --> 00:02:49.269
 samsung competitions of 1.12 microns 

00:02:47.680 --> 00:02:51.130
 while the apple, for example, has a 

00:02:49.269 --> 00:02:55.030
 smaller sensor by using a resolution 

00:02:51.130 --> 00:02:56.080
 greater minor has people over 1.5 

00:02:55.030 --> 00:02:58.060
 thousand clinicians 

00:02:56.080 --> 00:03:00.910
 so you have to click the apple 

00:02:58.060 --> 00:03:03.220
 more dynamic range but the sensitivity 

00:03:00.910 --> 00:03:05.470
 students kind of things but samsung 

00:03:03.220 --> 00:03:08.019
 proved that you can make a sensor 

00:03:05.470 --> 00:03:10.299
 it will not be too so it's just a 

00:03:08.019 --> 00:03:12.670
 matter of taking this is not what goes 

00:03:10.299 --> 00:03:13.570
 to import more into the g 4 bed that will be 

00:03:12.670 --> 00:03:16.810
 cool 

00:03:13.570 --> 00:03:17.980
 in fact there are two 22 resources 

00:03:16.810 --> 00:03:21.459
 very good 

00:03:17.980 --> 00:03:23.859
 the first one of them is a chroma sensor 

00:03:21.459 --> 00:03:27.220
 which is a sensor that lived spectrum 

00:03:23.859 --> 00:03:28.989
 diplomat of the scene and compares with what 

00:03:27.220 --> 00:03:30.850
 campaign on the essential of the normal camera 

00:03:28.989 --> 00:03:32.410
 to have a better field swing you 

00:03:30.850 --> 00:03:35.739
 It will make a lot of difference, it's one thing. 

00:03:32.410 --> 00:03:37.510
 You have to ensure nowhere and 

00:03:35.739 --> 00:03:39.190
 also entered the stabilization 

00:03:37.510 --> 00:03:40.810
 image stabilization on three axes 

00:03:39.190 --> 00:03:43.780
 which is the first that appears in the 

00:03:40.810 --> 00:03:47.530
 smartphone cameras every 70 in five 

00:03:43.780 --> 00:03:49.390
 axes that the Olympus doing but that is the 

00:03:47.530 --> 00:03:50.950
 first of three smartphones are 

00:03:49.390 --> 00:03:52.959
 presence can imagine that it establishes the 

00:03:50.950 --> 00:03:54.970
 image with sensor going forever low 

00:03:52.959 --> 00:03:55.600
 for there both sides forward to 

00:03:54.970 --> 00:03:58.660
 back 

00:03:55.600 --> 00:04:01.000
 then what is it helps you can take 

00:03:58.660 --> 00:04:01.540
 photos with the longest exposure time without 

00:04:01.000 --> 00:04:03.680
 to erase 

00:04:01.540 --> 00:04:07.730
 so you get rid of it 

00:04:03.680 --> 00:04:09.469
 Worst of all things is to something more 

00:04:07.730 --> 00:04:13.069
 is called optical stabilization as it is 

00:04:09.469 --> 00:04:15.290
 that this compares with what you already have is 

00:04:13.069 --> 00:04:17.690
 a standard lies on two axes 

00:04:15.290 --> 00:04:19.910
 then the third party will be able to leave 

00:04:17.690 --> 00:04:21.769
 you expose the photo for longer 

00:04:19.910 --> 00:04:23.449
 so rubber so you will not have 

00:04:21.769 --> 00:04:24.880
 to use it to Tony when image and 

00:04:23.449 --> 00:04:28.789
 resemblance 

00:04:24.880 --> 00:04:32.389
 finally ueg 4 is also the first 

00:04:28.789 --> 00:04:34.460
 android is that offers photo hall 

00:04:32.389 --> 00:04:37.550
 this is something I had already had 

00:04:34.460 --> 00:04:39.050
 your android lollipop 15.10 that for now 

00:04:37.550 --> 00:04:41.199
 is in the system but this is the first 

00:04:39.050 --> 00:04:44.630
 more creative device and reliability 

00:04:41.199 --> 00:04:47.210
 what it changes you will have much more 

00:04:44.630 --> 00:04:49.310
 edit freedom later will have more 

00:04:47.210 --> 00:04:52.430
 attitude and willingness to change 

00:04:49.310 --> 00:04:55.099
 white balance is so good to 

00:04:52.430 --> 00:04:56.840
 who shoots professionally with 

00:04:55.099 --> 00:04:58.430
 what is a smart thing 

00:04:56.840 --> 00:05:00.740
 strange 

00:04:58.430 --> 00:05:03.020
 if you want then these but you will 

00:05:00.740 --> 00:05:05.150
 have more options then heard 

00:05:03.020 --> 00:05:07.099
 1020 has the environmental options have 

00:05:05.150 --> 00:05:09.979
 this option is either the windows phone 

00:05:07.099 --> 00:05:11.810
 already themes but android we can possible 

00:05:09.979 --> 00:05:14.360
 national geographic photographer and took out 

00:05:11.810 --> 00:05:16.789
 photo with friend cincinnati use 

00:05:14.360 --> 00:05:18.500
 language when exactly the camera is just 

00:05:16.789 --> 00:05:20.180
 copy can be a bored too. 

00:05:18.500 --> 00:05:22.669
 has chances are a borada and goiás and 

00:05:20.180 --> 00:05:24.229
 maybe a little less man happens 

00:05:22.669 --> 00:05:26.300
 maybe a little more of the x-bike than 

00:05:24.229 --> 00:05:28.820
 promised technology that has show of the looks 

00:05:26.300 --> 00:05:32.449
 I think not because in the htc issue 

00:05:28.820 --> 00:05:34.580
 one and dodô athletics that had the texas 

00:05:32.449 --> 00:05:36.500
 notting hill pixel not technologies 

00:05:34.580 --> 00:05:38.479
 new or later launched the pair 

00:05:36.500 --> 00:05:40.310
 with that thing they had not done 

00:05:38.479 --> 00:05:42.500
 by the manufacturers themselves, we did not 

00:05:40.310 --> 00:05:45.380
 the disease did not have a sensor 

00:05:42.500 --> 00:05:47.690
 different in the case of htc and a matrix of 

00:05:45.380 --> 00:05:49.310
 different bay in the case of motorola in 

00:05:47.690 --> 00:05:50.930
 case of LG 

00:05:49.310 --> 00:05:53.030
 he is building on what already 

00:05:50.930 --> 00:05:55.370
 I had 23 that generates a very good camera 

00:05:53.030 --> 00:05:58.770
 already had optical stabilization of the 

00:05:55.370 --> 00:06:00.569
 two rg3 axes also had a 

00:05:58.770 --> 00:06:02.250
 a profile was very good because 

00:06:00.569 --> 00:06:04.020
 We are not in Rio de Janeiro and now 

00:06:02.250 --> 00:06:07.650
 will further improve with the sensor 

00:06:04.020 --> 00:06:10.110
 diploma so it 's something they already 

00:06:07.650 --> 00:06:13.020
 know is only improved over a 

00:06:10.110 --> 00:06:15.270
 base that already exist and have also had the 

00:06:13.020 --> 00:06:18.240
 fortress that comes back but touches them laser 

00:06:15.270 --> 00:06:22.440
 everything else is an active focus that he commands 

00:06:18.240 --> 00:06:25.319
 a sign is a sign shown up to 

00:06:22.440 --> 00:06:28.440
 approximately two meters that can 

00:06:25.319 --> 00:06:30.690
 read and from this distance can almost 

00:06:28.440 --> 00:06:32.849
 that immediately instances than you 

00:06:30.690 --> 00:06:34.949
 want to focus well and hopefully 

00:06:32.849 --> 00:06:37.530
 answered your doubt is the new supposed 

00:06:34.949 --> 00:06:40.819
 piloting old in the sound production of the 

00:06:37.530 --> 00:06:40.819
 movie is more too
