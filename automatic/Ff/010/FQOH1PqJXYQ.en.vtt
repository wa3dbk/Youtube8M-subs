00:00:04.390 --> 00:00:07.390
 game just starts 

00:00:08.789 --> 00:00:11.099
 Other users 

00:00:11.099 --> 00:00:14.099
 the consumption 

00:00:15.619 --> 00:00:20.050
 so that is transcendent poor 

00:00:20.050 --> 00:00:23.670
 in these last days there has been talk of a game that has caused 

00:00:23.669 --> 00:00:28.650
 much controversy since not only is it violent but it translates that violence 

00:00:28.649 --> 00:00:32.160
 to a well-known scenario for Mexicans 

00:00:32.160 --> 00:00:36.880
 I am talking about the colophon to this office of the company ibiza 

00:00:36.880 --> 00:00:41.040
 Chechnya and with a classification for over 18 years 

00:00:41.040 --> 00:00:45.510
 it is a sequel to a video game saga of ciu 3 call to all 

00:00:45.510 --> 00:00:46.350
 Juarez 

00:00:46.350 --> 00:00:50.050
 just that unlike the previous installments where the story is 

00:00:50.050 --> 00:00:53.269
 located in the old west this time 

00:00:53.269 --> 00:00:56.289
 They decided to move her to the current Ciudad Juarez in Chihuahua 

00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:01.620
 the story takes the elements of several films from the west and itself 

00:01:01.620 --> 00:01:05.760
 deals with the lives of two fugitive brothers and faces violence 

00:01:05.760 --> 00:01:10.130
 produced by drug trafficking and engaged in street shootings to 

00:01:10.130 --> 00:01:11.350
 save the life 

00:01:11.350 --> 00:01:13.110
 this controversial video game 

00:01:13.110 --> 00:01:16.240
 carries with it the even more controversial slogan 

00:01:16.240 --> 00:01:21.140
 do justice to your own hands and experimental anarchy of the far west 

00:01:21.140 --> 00:01:22.350
 modern 

00:01:22.350 --> 00:01:27.710
 because it causes so much controversy frankly the answer seems obvious we can 

00:01:27.710 --> 00:01:31.480
 summarize it in the violence and the place that they decided to take as scenario of the 

00:01:31.479 --> 00:01:32.180
 history 

00:01:32.180 --> 00:01:36.860
 but what is said is what stands out the most, the position of the 

00:01:36.860 --> 00:01:39.830
 local legislators of the state of chihuahua 

00:01:39.830 --> 00:01:43.630
 they assure that this video game not only denigrates the image of the city 

00:01:43.630 --> 00:01:48.190
 China that is a lack of respect towards the people who live there without 

00:01:48.190 --> 00:01:52.570
 leave aside that this type of games that promotes the practice of antivalores 

00:01:52.570 --> 00:01:57.610
 in children who are often educated to protect themselves from possible shootings 

00:01:57.610 --> 00:02:00.760
 by projects in the area and also that they exalt the violence 

00:02:01.390 --> 00:02:06.570
 especially in teenagers who are tempted by the de facto crime of 

00:02:06.570 --> 00:02:10.530
 agreement with the audience barraza of the independent popular organization that 

00:02:10.530 --> 00:02:14.959
 he works in the slums of the city many children say I want to be 

00:02:14.959 --> 00:02:19.520
 hitman because they are the ones that go completely and that this video game as the 

00:02:19.520 --> 00:02:23.080
 narcocorridos portray cartel leaders as heroes 

00:02:23.080 --> 00:02:26.260
 distorting what they really are like 

00:02:26.260 --> 00:02:27.499
 criminals 

00:02:27.499 --> 00:02:31.939
 On the other side, both cubillas and some others assure that the objective 

00:02:31.939 --> 00:02:37.499
 of the game is pure entertainment and that the story is completely fictional 

00:02:37.499 --> 00:02:42.529
 on the cover of it makes reference to everything - to Ciudad Juarez and that in everything 

00:02:42.529 --> 00:02:46.389
 case the violence does not come from the video game nor this combat 

00:02:46.389 --> 00:02:48.580
 blocking them but rather rather 

00:02:48.580 --> 00:02:52.990
 priorities should be focused on improving education and programs 

00:02:52.990 --> 00:02:54.519
 social of said entity 

00:02:54.519 --> 00:03:00.120
 so in the end we could say that definitely the priority is not my 

00:03:00.120 --> 00:03:04.859
 It must be in blocking a video game, however, it should not be encouraged either. 

00:03:04.859 --> 00:03:09.459
 this kind of stories and even if they are fictional, they favor people 

00:03:09.459 --> 00:03:10.599
 wrong 

00:03:10.599 --> 00:03:15.669
 in the end this is the information and the opinion is pregnant what do you think 

00:03:16.739 --> 00:03:22.890
