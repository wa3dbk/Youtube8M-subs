more<00:01:45.479> unplayable<00:01:47.270> up<00:01:48.270> a<00:01:48.390> hell<00:01:48.630> of<00:01:48.659> a<00:01:48.840> lot

00:01:48.980 --> 00:01:48.990 
more unplayable up a hell of a lot

00:01:48.990 --> 00:01:51.710 
more unplayable up a hell of a lot
faster<00:01:49.310> now<00:01:50.310> the<00:01:50.370> XP<00:01:50.820> boosts<00:01:51.210> work<00:01:51.540> a

00:01:51.710 --> 00:01:51.720 
faster now the XP boosts work a

00:01:51.720 --> 00:01:53.510

basically<00:01:54.479> you<00:01:54.600> can<00:01:54.750> apply<00:01:55.050> a<00:01:55.080> boost<00:01:55.590> to<00:01:55.979> one

00:01:56.210 --> 00:01:56.220 
basically you can apply a boost to one

00:01:56.220 --> 00:01:58.670 
basically you can apply a boost to one
specific<00:01:56.729> class<00:01:56.880> operator<00:01:57.690> for<00:01:57.900> example<00:01:58.380> so

00:01:58.670 --> 00:01:58.680 
specific class operator for example so

00:01:58.680 --> 00:02:00.649 
specific class operator for example so
it<00:01:58.890> won't<00:01:59.040> be<00:01:59.159> just<00:01:59.340> a<00:01:59.460> general<00:01:59.760> XP<00:02:00.420> boost

00:02:00.649 --> 00:02:00.659 
it won't be just a general XP boost

00:02:00.659 --> 00:02:02.180 
it won't be just a general XP boost
being<00:02:00.990> applied<00:02:01.260> you<00:02:01.500> actually<00:02:01.799> have<00:02:01.890> to<00:02:02.010> play

00:02:02.180 --> 00:02:02.190 
being applied you actually have to play

00:02:02.190 --> 00:02:04.010 
being applied you actually have to play
on<00:02:02.490> the<00:02:02.610> specific<00:02:03.060> class<00:02:03.240> you<00:02:03.450> put<00:02:03.630> it<00:02:03.720> on<00:02:03.840> now

00:02:04.010 --> 00:02:04.020 
on the specific class you put it on now

00:02:04.020 --> 00:02:06.590 
on the specific class you put it on now
which<00:02:04.590> is<00:02:04.740> pretty<00:02:04.890> cool<00:02:05.130> now<00:02:06.030> pretty<00:02:06.210> much<00:02:06.299> the

which is pretty cool now pretty much the

fast is to play conquest on the block

00:02:47.190 --> 00:02:49.460 
fast is to play conquest on the block
now<00:02:47.549> there's<00:02:47.730> a<00:02:47.849> few<00:02:48.090> servers<00:02:48.480> that<00:02:48.599> are<00:02:48.660> on<00:02:48.900> PC

00:02:49.460 --> 00:02:49.470 
now there's a few servers that are on PC

00:02:49.470 --> 00:02:52.550 
now there's a few servers that are on PC
that<00:02:49.709> run<00:02:50.069> 24/7<00:02:50.760> so<00:02:51.510> this<00:02:51.660> map<00:02:51.840> is<00:02:52.019> definitely

00:02:52.550 --> 00:02:52.560 
that run 24/7 so this map is definitely

00:02:52.560 --> 00:02:54.860 
that run 24/7 so this map is definitely

the new Metro it's vertical with 64
players<00:02:55.170> it's<00:02:55.500> pretty<00:02:55.709> much<00:02:55.829> operation<00:02:56.519> Metro

00:02:56.839 --> 00:02:56.849

all<00:02:57.090> over<00:02:57.390> again<00:02:57.510> now<00:02:58.230> the<00:02:58.290> good<00:02:58.440> thing<00:02:58.590> about

00:02:58.610 --> 00:02:58.620 
all over again now the good thing about

00:02:58.620 --> 00:03:01.130 
all over again now the good thing about
this<00:02:58.950> is<00:02:59.250> that<00:02:59.519> you<00:02:59.640> can<00:02:59.819> apply<00:03:00.269> a<00:03:00.360> 200%

00:03:01.130 --> 00:03:01.140 
this is that you can apply a 200%

00:03:01.140 --> 00:03:03.140 
this is that you can apply a 200%
teamplay<00:03:01.920> boost<00:03:02.190> and<00:03:02.459> simply<00:03:02.730> throw<00:03:02.760> it<00:03:03.000> on

00:03:03.140 --> 00:03:03.150 
teamplay boost and simply throw it on

00:03:03.150 --> 00:03:05.000 
teamplay boost and simply throw it on
meds<00:03:03.480> and<00:03:03.810> revive<00:03:04.170> people<00:03:04.470> you're<00:03:04.739> going<00:03:04.950> to

the easiest methods you can do to level
up<00:03:18.510> very<00:03:18.750> quickly<00:03:19.049> one<00:03:19.859> team<00:03:20.099> is<00:03:20.310> usually

00:03:20.479 --> 00:03:20.489 
up very quickly one team is usually

00:03:20.489 --> 00:03:22.670 
up very quickly one team is usually
spawn<00:03:20.970> trapped<00:03:21.299> so<00:03:21.690> if<00:03:21.930> you<00:03:22.109> can<00:03:22.319> manage<00:03:22.500> to

00:03:22.670 --> 00:03:22.680 
spawn trapped so if you can manage to

00:03:22.680 --> 00:03:24.410 
spawn trapped so if you can manage to
get<00:03:22.950> on<00:03:23.040> the<00:03:23.160> team<00:03:23.400> that<00:03:23.430> is<00:03:23.640> spawn<00:03:24.120> trapping

00:03:24.410 --> 00:03:24.420 
get on the team that is spawn trapping

00:03:24.420 --> 00:03:25.819 
get on the team that is spawn trapping
you're<00:03:24.750> going<00:03:24.989> to<00:03:25.049> have<00:03:25.200> a<00:03:25.230> really<00:03:25.709> really

00:03:25.819 --> 00:03:25.829 
you're going to have a really really

00:03:25.829 --> 00:03:28.280 
you're going to have a really really
good<00:03:26.340> round<00:03:26.609> I<00:03:26.879> think<00:03:27.420> I<00:03:27.510> ended<00:03:27.870> up<00:03:28.049> with

00:03:28.280 --> 00:03:28.290 
good round I think I ended up with

00:03:28.290 --> 00:03:30.289 
good round I think I ended up with
almost<00:03:28.620> a<00:03:28.709> hundred<00:03:28.890> kills<00:03:29.340> a<00:03:29.519> few<00:03:29.760> times<00:03:30.030> now

00:03:30.289 --> 00:03:30.299 
almost a hundred kills a few times now

00:03:30.299 --> 00:03:32.030 
almost a hundred kills a few times now
and<00:03:30.329> the<00:03:30.660> matches<00:03:30.989> end<00:03:31.169> up<00:03:31.319> lasting<00:03:31.739> about<00:03:31.919> an

00:03:32.030 --> 00:03:32.040 
and the matches end up lasting about an

00:03:32.040 --> 00:03:34.940 
and the matches end up lasting about an
hour<00:03:32.190> so<00:03:32.639> -<00:03:32.700> so<00:03:33.269> that<00:03:33.810> is<00:03:33.959> plenty<00:03:34.500> of<00:03:34.560> time<00:03:34.620> to

00:03:34.940 --> 00:03:34.950 
hour so - so that is plenty of time to

00:03:34.950 --> 00:03:37.819 
hour so - so that is plenty of time to
grind<00:03:35.130> out<00:03:35.310> some<00:03:35.489> XP<00:03:35.880> and<00:03:36.120> kills<00:03:36.680> now<00:03:37.680> one

00:03:37.819 --> 00:03:37.829 
grind out some XP and kills now one

00:03:37.829 --> 00:03:39.500 
grind out some XP and kills now one
thing<00:03:38.010> to<00:03:38.069> remember<00:03:38.160> about<00:03:38.519> hard<00:03:39.060> line<00:03:39.269> is

00:03:39.500 --> 00:03:39.510 
thing to remember about hard line is

00:03:39.510 --> 00:03:41.720 
thing to remember about hard line is
that<00:03:39.660> XP<00:03:40.049> turns<00:03:40.319> into<00:03:40.530> endgame<00:03:41.010> cash<00:03:41.310> as<00:03:41.549> well

00:03:41.720 --> 00:03:41.730 
that XP turns into endgame cash as well

00:03:41.730 --> 00:03:43.699 
that XP turns into endgame cash as well
so<00:03:42.299> the<00:03:42.419> more<00:03:42.599> you<00:03:42.720> earn<00:03:42.870> the<00:03:43.169> faster<00:03:43.590> you

00:03:43.699 --> 00:03:43.709 
so the more you earn the faster you

00:03:43.709 --> 00:03:45.229 
so the more you earn the faster you
level<00:03:44.010> up<00:03:44.130> and<00:03:44.370> the<00:03:44.459> more<00:03:44.639> money<00:03:44.880> you<00:03:45.030> get<00:03:45.180> to

00:03:45.229 --> 00:03:45.239 
level up and the more money you get to

00:03:45.239 --> 00:03:47.390 
level up and the more money you get to
spend<00:03:45.599> playing<00:03:46.109> on<00:03:46.260> the<00:03:46.380> block<00:03:46.620> will<00:03:46.889> probably

00:03:47.390 --> 00:03:47.400 
spend playing on the block will probably

00:03:47.400 --> 00:03:49.339 
spend playing on the block will probably
get<00:03:47.549> you<00:03:47.609> about<00:03:47.910> thirty<00:03:48.299> to<00:03:48.510> forty<00:03:48.840> thousand

00:03:49.339 --> 00:03:49.349
