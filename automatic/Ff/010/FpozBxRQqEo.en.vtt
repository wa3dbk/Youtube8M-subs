00:00:50.299 --> 00:00:50.309 
the Blitz won't get in because Troy

00:00:50.309 --> 00:00:51.439

00:00:52.700 --> 00:00:52.710 
because he has to get out the huddle

00:00:52.710 --> 00:00:55.160 
because he has to get out the huddle
it's<00:00:53.219> a<00:00:53.339> go<00:00:53.519> up<00:00:53.729> top<00:00:53.969> to<00:00:54.269> his<00:00:54.510> spot<00:00:54.749> and<00:00:55.050> then
