 video tutorials and this time we go 

00:00:14.080 --> 00:00:17.770

 very compact cow that will allow us to 

00:00:17.770 --> 00:00:19.750
 breed cows but also 

00:00:19.240 --> 00:00:21.820
 to cook 

00:00:19.750 --> 00:00:23.890
 and all that in a very simple way 

00:00:21.820 --> 00:00:25.660
 to use it in a first 

00:00:23.890 --> 00:00:26.500
 time you have to take wheat for 

00:00:25.660 --> 00:00:28.600

 cows so that she jumps and feed 

00:00:33.580 --> 00:00:37.720
 once this comes down and and 

00:00:36.160 --> 00:00:40.750
 reminded again of the button 

00:00:37.720 --> 00:00:42.489
 stayed a few seconds in front of the 

00:00:40.750 --> 00:00:45.070
 machine with your wheat to attract the 

00:00:42.489 --> 00:00:46.360
 cows babies in the hole next 

00:00:45.070 --> 00:00:48.339

 hopper behind then placed a block 

00:01:01.479 --> 00:01:04.900
 behind the hopper to be able to place 

00:01:02.920 --> 00:01:06.909
