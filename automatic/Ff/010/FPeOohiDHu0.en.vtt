about<00:00:58.230> consoles<00:00:58.829> that<00:00:58.920> typically<00:00:59.340> retail<00:00:59.640> for

00:01:00.310 --> 00:01:00.320 
about consoles that typically retail for

00:01:00.320 --> 00:01:02.990 
about consoles that typically retail for
$400<00:01:01.320> a<00:01:01.350> piece<00:01:01.649> can<00:01:02.219> walmart<00:01:02.579> recoup<00:01:02.879> the

00:01:02.990 --> 00:01:03.000 
$400 a piece can walmart recoup the

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:05.450 
$400 a piece can walmart recoup the
losses<00:01:03.439> yeah<00:01:04.439> I<00:01:04.619> think<00:01:04.680> I<00:01:04.979> believe<00:01:05.129> it<00:01:05.339> was

00:01:05.450 --> 00:01:05.460 
losses yeah I think I believe it was

00:01:05.460 --> 00:01:07.550 
losses yeah I think I believe it was
actually<00:01:05.610> just<00:01:05.909> for<00:01:06.210> consoles<00:01:06.780> so<00:01:07.049> I<00:01:07.080> think<00:01:07.409> to

00:01:07.550 --> 00:01:07.560 
actually just for consoles so I think to

00:01:07.560 --> 00:01:10.039 
actually just for consoles so I think to
Walmart<00:01:08.040> the<00:01:08.220> giant<00:01:08.549> that<00:01:08.610> it<00:01:08.820> is<00:01:09.000> it<00:01:09.479> wasn't

00:01:10.039 --> 00:01:10.049 
Walmart the giant that it is it wasn't

00:01:10.049 --> 00:01:12.859 
Walmart the giant that it is it wasn't
that<00:01:10.200> big<00:01:10.470> of<00:01:10.500> a<00:01:10.680> loss<00:01:10.890> I<00:01:11.280> do<00:01:11.580> think<00:01:12.210> that<00:01:12.299> from

00:01:12.859 --> 00:01:12.869 
that big of a loss I do think that from

00:01:12.869 --> 00:01:14.719 
that big of a loss I do think that from
a<00:01:13.140> public<00:01:13.680> relations<00:01:13.710> perspective<00:01:14.280> for

00:01:14.719 --> 00:01:14.729 
a public relations perspective for

00:01:14.729 --> 00:01:16.820 
a public relations perspective for
Walmart<00:01:15.240> they<00:01:15.689> have<00:01:16.140> an<00:01:16.200> opportunity<00:01:16.710> to

00:01:16.820 --> 00:01:16.830 
Walmart they have an opportunity to

00:01:16.830 --> 00:01:19.249 
Walmart they have an opportunity to
actually<00:01:16.950> spin<00:01:17.460> this<00:01:17.670> into<00:01:17.939> a<00:01:18.509> really<00:01:19.110> good

00:01:19.249 --> 00:01:19.259 
actually spin this into a really good

00:01:19.259 --> 00:01:21.950 
actually spin this into a really good
opportunity<00:01:19.530> to<00:01:20.009> show<00:01:20.220> how<00:01:20.400> they<00:01:20.580> honor<00:01:20.960> their
