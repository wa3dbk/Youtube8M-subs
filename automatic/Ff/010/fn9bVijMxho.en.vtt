good day folks it's me again and welcome
to<00:00:05.549> another<00:00:06.319> expose<00:00:07.319> today<00:00:08.030> we're<00:00:09.030> gonna<00:00:09.120> look

00:00:09.410 --> 00:00:09.420 
to another expose today we're gonna look

00:00:09.420 --> 00:00:11.629 
to another expose today we're gonna look
at<00:00:09.570> the<00:00:09.660> Western<00:00:10.050> Digital<00:00:10.320> my<00:00:10.769> book<00:00:11.040> essential

00:00:11.629 --> 00:00:11.639 
at the Western Digital my book essential

00:00:11.639 --> 00:00:13.700 
at the Western Digital my book essential
this<00:00:12.210> is<00:00:12.360> essentially<00:00:12.960> a<00:00:12.990> piece<00:00:13.290> of<00:00:13.469> garbage

00:00:13.700 --> 00:00:13.710 
this is essentially a piece of garbage

00:00:13.710 --> 00:00:18.769 
this is essentially a piece of garbage
this<00:00:14.670> is<00:00:14.880> the<00:00:15.030> second<00:00:15.450> one<00:00:15.570> I've<00:00:15.719> had<00:00:17.779> yeah

00:00:18.769 --> 00:00:18.779 
this is the second one I've had yeah

00:00:18.779 --> 00:00:33.049 
this is the second one I've had yeah
it's<00:00:19.710> a<00:00:19.890> very<00:00:20.130> stupid<00:00:20.820> design<00:00:31.189> because<00:00:32.189> for

00:00:33.049 --> 00:00:33.059 
it's a very stupid design because for

00:00:33.059 --> 00:00:34.880 
it's a very stupid design because for
number<00:00:33.360> one<00:00:33.570> if<00:00:33.840> you're<00:00:34.350> sitting<00:00:34.559> it<00:00:34.739> on<00:00:34.860> a

00:00:34.880 --> 00:00:34.890 
number one if you're sitting it on a

00:00:34.890 --> 00:00:36.530 
number one if you're sitting it on a
desk<00:00:35.250> and<00:00:35.489> you<00:00:35.550> got<00:00:35.730> kids<00:00:36.030> around<00:00:36.300> or

00:00:36.530 --> 00:00:36.540 
desk and you got kids around or

00:00:36.540 --> 00:00:38.119 
desk and you got kids around or
something<00:00:36.840> it<00:00:36.930> could<00:00:36.960> easily<00:00:37.200> get<00:00:37.860> knocked

00:00:38.119 --> 00:00:38.129 
something it could easily get knocked

00:00:38.129 --> 00:00:43.459 
something it could easily get knocked
over<00:00:38.430> and<00:00:38.790> damaged<00:00:41.210> so<00:00:42.210> without<00:00:43.020> having<00:00:43.350> a

00:00:43.459 --> 00:00:43.469 
over and damaged so without having a

00:00:43.469 --> 00:00:46.190 
over and damaged so without having a
proper<00:00:44.250> base<00:00:44.520> on<00:00:44.850> it<00:00:45.059> or<00:00:45.360> even<00:00:45.809> a<00:00:45.899> base<00:00:46.170> that

00:00:46.190 --> 00:00:46.200 
proper base on it or even a base that

00:00:46.200 --> 00:00:48.410 
proper base on it or even a base that
might<00:00:46.739> try<00:00:47.070> to<00:00:47.129> absorb<00:00:47.610> some<00:00:47.969> of<00:00:48.000> the<00:00:48.210> noise

00:00:48.410 --> 00:00:48.420 
might try to absorb some of the noise

00:00:48.420 --> 00:00:51.350 
might try to absorb some of the noise
this<00:00:49.260> one<00:00:49.500> makes<00:00:49.739> a<00:00:49.890> lot<00:00:50.129> of<00:00:50.160> noise<00:00:50.329> the<00:00:51.329> first

00:00:51.350 --> 00:00:51.360 
this one makes a lot of noise the first

00:00:51.360 --> 00:00:53.930 
this one makes a lot of noise the first
one<00:00:51.840> I<00:00:51.870> had<00:00:52.140> was<00:00:52.350> nice<00:00:52.559> and<00:00:52.770> quiet<00:00:53.039> I<00:00:53.460> actually

00:00:53.930 --> 00:00:53.940 
one I had was nice and quiet I actually

00:00:53.940 --> 00:00:57.049 
one I had was nice and quiet I actually
had<00:00:54.270> to<00:00:54.390> put<00:00:54.420> my<00:00:54.780> ear<00:00:55.170> up<00:00:55.199> against<00:00:55.860> it<00:00:56.039> to<00:00:56.850> tell

00:00:57.049 --> 00:00:57.059 
had to put my ear up against it to tell

00:00:57.059 --> 00:00:59.689 
had to put my ear up against it to tell
if<00:00:57.270> it<00:00:57.420> was<00:00:57.449> spinning<00:00:58.050> or<00:00:58.170> not<00:00:58.230> this<00:00:59.100> one<00:00:59.370> here

00:00:59.689 --> 00:00:59.699 
if it was spinning or not this one here

00:00:59.699 --> 00:01:03.410 
if it was spinning or not this one here
when<00:01:00.329> I<00:01:00.359> put<00:01:00.600> it<00:01:00.719> on<00:01:00.809> a<00:01:00.840> desk<00:01:01.199> I<00:01:02.239> don't<00:01:03.239> know<00:01:03.300> if

00:01:03.410 --> 00:01:03.420 
when I put it on a desk I don't know if

00:01:03.420 --> 00:01:05.329 
when I put it on a desk I don't know if
you<00:01:03.539> can<00:01:03.690> hear<00:01:03.960> it<00:01:03.989> but<00:01:04.110> there's<00:01:04.470> a<00:01:04.530> low

00:01:05.329 --> 00:01:05.339 
you can hear it but there's a low

00:01:05.339 --> 00:01:14.620 
you can hear it but there's a low
frequency<00:01:05.610> draw<00:01:06.360> noise

00:01:14.620 --> 00:01:14.630 

00:01:14.630 --> 00:01:26.690 

and<00:01:14.720> I<00:01:15.350> can<00:01:15.560> feel<00:01:15.799> the<00:01:16.010> vibration

00:01:26.690 --> 00:01:26.700 

00:01:26.700 --> 00:01:29.430 

so<00:01:27.700> this<00:01:27.880> one<00:01:28.060> here<00:01:28.330> the<00:01:28.540> drive<00:01:28.840> is<00:01:29.020> either<00:01:29.170> off

00:01:29.430 --> 00:01:29.440 
so this one here the drive is either off

00:01:29.440 --> 00:01:32.550 
so this one here the drive is either off
balance<00:01:30.010> or<00:01:30.280> the<00:01:30.630> platters<00:01:31.630> may<00:01:31.840> be<00:01:31.900> warped<00:01:32.350> or

00:01:32.550 --> 00:01:32.560 
balance or the platters may be warped or

00:01:32.560 --> 00:01:35.760 
balance or the platters may be warped or
something<00:01:32.979> causing<00:01:33.430> a<00:01:33.520> vibration<00:01:34.590> so<00:01:35.590> what<00:01:35.740> I

00:01:35.760 --> 00:01:35.770 
something causing a vibration so what I

00:01:35.770 --> 00:01:38.820 
something causing a vibration so what I
did<00:01:35.890> is<00:01:36.220> I<00:01:36.460> put<00:01:36.490> it<00:01:36.820> on<00:01:36.940> two<00:01:37.150> pieces<00:01:37.600> of<00:01:37.900> old

00:01:38.820 --> 00:01:38.830 
did is I put it on two pieces of old

00:01:38.830 --> 00:01:44.670 
did is I put it on two pieces of old
mouse<00:01:39.220> pad<00:01:39.549> and<00:01:42.780> essentially<00:01:43.780> that<00:01:43.960> quiets<00:01:44.500> it

00:01:44.670 --> 00:01:44.680 
mouse pad and essentially that quiets it

00:01:44.680 --> 00:01:53.190 
mouse pad and essentially that quiets it
down<00:01:44.860> a<00:01:45.210> fair<00:01:46.210> bit<00:01:48.899> the<00:01:49.899> problem<00:01:50.290> is<00:01:51.990> once<00:01:52.990> it's

00:01:53.190 --> 00:01:53.200 
down a fair bit the problem is once it's

00:01:53.200 --> 00:01:55.230 
down a fair bit the problem is once it's
on<00:01:53.320> the<00:01:53.470> mousepad<00:01:53.649> like<00:01:54.220> that<00:01:54.430> and<00:01:54.640> you<00:01:55.000> think

00:01:55.230 --> 00:01:55.240 
on the mousepad like that and you think

00:01:55.240 --> 00:01:57.719 
on the mousepad like that and you think
it's<00:01:55.390> quiet<00:01:55.690> you<00:01:56.320> can<00:01:56.440> sit<00:01:56.680> a<00:01:56.710> coffee<00:01:57.009> cup<00:01:57.369> over

00:01:57.719 --> 00:01:57.729 
it's quiet you can sit a coffee cup over

00:01:57.729 --> 00:02:00.990 
it's quiet you can sit a coffee cup over
here<00:01:58.000> and<00:01:58.179> it<00:01:58.869> will<00:01:59.190> start<00:02:00.190> amplifying<00:02:00.820> the

00:02:00.990 --> 00:02:01.000 
here and it will start amplifying the

00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:04.710 
here and it will start amplifying the
noise<00:02:01.179> again<00:02:02.280> so<00:02:03.280> stay<00:02:04.090> away<00:02:04.210> from<00:02:04.360> these

00:02:04.710 --> 00:02:04.720 
noise again so stay away from these

00:02:04.720 --> 00:02:07.529 
noise again so stay away from these
they're<00:02:05.320> a<00:02:05.350> piece<00:02:05.679> of<00:02:05.860> crap<00:02:06.130> they're<00:02:06.820> the<00:02:07.030> two

00:02:07.529 --> 00:02:07.539 
they're a piece of crap they're the two

00:02:07.539 --> 00:02:11.520 
they're a piece of crap they're the two
terabyte<00:02:08.160> 3.0<00:02:09.160> and<00:02:10.110> one<00:02:11.110> of<00:02:11.230> the<00:02:11.290> problems

00:02:11.520 --> 00:02:11.530 
terabyte 3.0 and one of the problems

00:02:11.530 --> 00:02:13.620 
terabyte 3.0 and one of the problems
they<00:02:11.890> have<00:02:12.100> is<00:02:12.280> these<00:02:12.459> connectors<00:02:13.090> our

00:02:13.620 --> 00:02:13.630 
they have is these connectors our

00:02:13.630 --> 00:02:16.620 
they have is these connectors our
surface<00:02:14.230> mount<00:02:14.530> on<00:02:14.800> the<00:02:15.400> board<00:02:15.700> and<00:02:16.000> if<00:02:16.450> you

00:02:16.620 --> 00:02:16.630 
surface mount on the board and if you

00:02:16.630 --> 00:02:19.350 
surface mount on the board and if you
unplug<00:02:16.840> and<00:02:17.530> plug<00:02:17.560> it<00:02:18.010> in<00:02:18.190> several<00:02:18.640> times<00:02:19.060> to

00:02:19.350 --> 00:02:19.360 
unplug and plug it in several times to

00:02:19.360 --> 00:02:21.270 
unplug and plug it in several times to
use<00:02:19.540> it<00:02:19.690> as<00:02:19.840> a<00:02:19.870> portable<00:02:20.319> drive<00:02:20.620> like<00:02:21.100> it's

00:02:21.270 --> 00:02:21.280 
use it as a portable drive like it's

00:02:21.280 --> 00:02:24.900 
use it as a portable drive like it's
intended<00:02:23.069> you'll<00:02:24.069> end<00:02:24.250> up<00:02:24.340> breaking<00:02:24.670> the

00:02:24.900 --> 00:02:24.910 
intended you'll end up breaking the

00:02:24.910 --> 00:02:27.690 
intended you'll end up breaking the
connector<00:02:25.420> off<00:02:25.569> I<00:02:26.069> haven't<00:02:27.069> had<00:02:27.220> that<00:02:27.250> problem

00:02:27.690 --> 00:02:27.700 
connector off I haven't had that problem

00:02:27.700 --> 00:02:30.150 
connector off I haven't had that problem
because<00:02:28.239> I<00:02:28.510> just<00:02:29.080> plugged<00:02:29.380> it<00:02:29.530> in<00:02:29.680> from<00:02:29.950> new

00:02:30.150 --> 00:02:30.160 
because I just plugged it in from new

00:02:30.160 --> 00:02:32.960 
because I just plugged it in from new
and<00:02:30.400> left<00:02:30.579> it<00:02:30.760> on<00:02:30.820> the<00:02:30.880> desk<00:02:31.180> the<00:02:31.600> first<00:02:31.840> one

00:02:32.960 --> 00:02:32.970 
and left it on the desk the first one

00:02:32.970 --> 00:02:39.690 
and left it on the desk the first one
had<00:02:33.970> problems<00:02:34.480> with<00:02:34.660> data<00:02:34.840> errors<00:02:35.380> I<00:02:38.700> was

00:02:39.690 --> 00:02:39.700 
had problems with data errors I was

00:02:39.700 --> 00:02:41.789 
had problems with data errors I was
having<00:02:40.000> problems<00:02:40.150> I<00:02:40.630> ran<00:02:40.930> a<00:02:40.959> scan<00:02:41.290> on<00:02:41.350> it<00:02:41.650> and

00:02:41.789 --> 00:02:41.799 
having problems I ran a scan on it and

00:02:41.799 --> 00:02:46.979 
having problems I ran a scan on it and
there<00:02:41.980> was<00:02:42.660> bad<00:02:43.660> sectors<00:02:44.140> on<00:02:44.350> the<00:02:44.440> drive<00:02:45.989> so

00:02:46.979 --> 00:02:46.989 
there was bad sectors on the drive so

00:02:46.989 --> 00:02:48.840 
there was bad sectors on the drive so
after<00:02:47.350> scanning<00:02:47.799> it<00:02:48.010> for<00:02:48.370> bad<00:02:48.519> sectors

00:02:48.840 --> 00:02:48.850

starts<00:04:21.099> to<00:04:21.280> drive<00:04:21.549> spinning<00:04:21.789> and<00:04:22.270> then<00:04:22.360> goes

00:04:22.529 --> 00:04:22.539 
starts to drive spinning and then goes

00:04:22.539 --> 00:04:25.740 
starts to drive spinning and then goes
back<00:04:22.570> to<00:04:22.810> sleep<00:04:23.970> so<00:04:24.970> then<00:04:25.120> the<00:04:25.300> computer

00:04:25.740 --> 00:04:25.750 
back to sleep so then the computer

00:04:25.750 --> 00:04:28.680 
back to sleep so then the computer
continues<00:04:26.259> to<00:04:26.440> boot<00:04:26.940> and<00:04:27.940> it<00:04:28.210> doesn't<00:04:28.509> mount

00:04:28.680 --> 00:04:28.690 
continues to boot and it doesn't mount

00:04:28.690 --> 00:04:31.010 
continues to boot and it doesn't mount
the<00:04:28.870> drive<00:04:29.110> because<00:04:29.410> the<00:04:29.680> enclosure<00:04:30.039> sleeping

00:04:31.010 --> 00:04:31.020 
the drive because the enclosure sleeping

00:04:31.020 --> 00:04:33.210 
the drive because the enclosure sleeping
so<00:04:32.020> then<00:04:32.169> what<00:04:32.320> you<00:04:32.410> have<00:04:32.440> to<00:04:32.590> do<00:04:32.830> is<00:04:32.949> pull<00:04:33.190> the

00:04:33.210 --> 00:04:33.220 
so then what you have to do is pull the

00:04:33.220 --> 00:04:36.029 
so then what you have to do is pull the
power<00:04:33.490> plug<00:04:33.880> on<00:04:34.060> the<00:04:34.180> back<00:04:34.470> plug<00:04:35.470> it<00:04:35.590> back<00:04:35.620> in

00:04:36.029 --> 00:04:36.039 
power plug on the back plug it back in

00:04:36.039 --> 00:04:38.279 
power plug on the back plug it back in
then<00:04:36.970> it<00:04:37.090> comes<00:04:37.300> on<00:04:37.539> and<00:04:37.720> if<00:04:37.840> you<00:04:37.930> are<00:04:37.960> planning

00:04:38.279 --> 00:04:38.289 
then it comes on and if you are planning

00:04:38.289 --> 00:04:40.490 
then it comes on and if you are planning
on<00:04:38.500> using<00:04:38.530> it<00:04:38.919> as<00:04:39.039> a<00:04:39.070> network<00:04:39.340> shared<00:04:39.849> drive

00:04:40.490 --> 00:04:40.500 
on using it as a network shared drive

00:04:40.500 --> 00:04:43.290 
on using it as a network shared drive
it's<00:04:41.500> not<00:04:41.710> going<00:04:41.919> to<00:04:41.979> be<00:04:42.099> in<00:04:42.370> shared<00:04:42.820> mode<00:04:43.090> so

00:04:43.290 --> 00:04:43.300 
it's not going to be in shared mode so

00:04:43.300 --> 00:04:44.640 
it's not going to be in shared mode so
then<00:04:43.449> you've<00:04:43.570> got<00:04:43.690> to<00:04:43.810> reboot<00:04:44.169> your<00:04:44.320> entire

00:04:44.640 --> 00:04:44.650 
then you've got to reboot your entire

00:04:44.650 --> 00:04:47.040 
then you've got to reboot your entire
system<00:04:45.010> now<00:04:45.849> if<00:04:46.000> you<00:04:46.120> want<00:04:46.330> to<00:04:46.570> hook<00:04:46.780> this<00:04:46.990> up

00:04:47.040 --> 00:04:47.050 
system now if you want to hook this up

00:04:47.050 --> 00:04:49.379 
system now if you want to hook this up
to<00:04:47.409> say<00:04:47.590> a<00:04:47.620> media<00:04:48.010> center<00:04:48.400> like<00:04:48.610> I<00:04:48.760> planned<00:04:49.150> on
