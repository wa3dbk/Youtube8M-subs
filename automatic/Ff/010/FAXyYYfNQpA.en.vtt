00:00:00.760 --> 00:00:04.120
 re min 

00:00:16.410 --> 00:00:24.380
 It is Yukari Yukari that the body has returned to its original state 

00:00:20.520 --> 00:00:28.099
 It is a string-winding maki under makeup with the 2 and halo 2 system 

00:00:24.380 --> 00:00:30.180
 The clothes change with the atmosphere of nyanpasu and it is fresh 

00:00:28.099 --> 00:00:34.070
 It is Tohoku Zunko 

00:00:30.180 --> 00:00:38.840
 Hey Sunchikuwa confectionery of the house by her is cute do husband Dao 

00:00:34.070 --> 00:00:40.730
 Summary of the video Thank you for watching the video 

00:00:38.840 --> 00:00:43.579
 I do not do it 

00:00:40.730 --> 00:00:48.829
 I had returned Well Yukari-chan body 

00:00:43.579 --> 00:00:54.409
 Do not say that because I do, but what you came off also doing came gone back 

00:00:48.829 --> 00:00:56.590
 Of pedophile who thinks and what I took in it whether Ne Ja you doing to your deterioration is your okay 

00:00:54.409 --> 00:01:02.940
 Since the breasts is as it is 

00:00:56.590 --> 00:01:02.940
 Husband, please write a will and think of a will in the near future 

00:01:04.370 --> 00:01:13.730
 Let's start the continuation of church architecture 

00:01:08.120 --> 00:01:19.909
 To use this because Nether Quartz block the previous mercury lamp has provided us with have a large number of 

00:01:13.730 --> 00:01:25.390
 Let's get it and replace it with the remaining wool block. Will the number be enough? 

00:01:19.909 --> 00:01:29.190
 I do not know because I did not count it so far, but I think it is probably just enough 

00:01:25.390 --> 00:01:29.190
 It is not If you also Nether go missing 

00:01:31.530 --> 00:01:37.820
 If you do not have enough, you will be able to do something with Mr. Mogi's show, so it's all right 

00:01:37.950 --> 00:01:48.530
 Let's first replacement and the will of the wood to wait this chair 

00:01:42.200 --> 00:01:49.990
 OK EVERY-CHAN, I will be an air chair and use me as a chair 

00:01:48.530 --> 00:01:52.300
 Do you say 

00:01:49.990 --> 00:01:56.500
 Will you enter peniban 

00:01:52.300 --> 00:01:59.310
 It's a guy who says I'm absolutely in, I stopped the camera a little more 

00:01:56.500 --> 00:01:59.310
 It's time to preach 

00:02:02.270 --> 00:02:09.060
 I was at the end is replaced yes chair 

00:02:05.200 --> 00:02:14.400
 I think the distinction between the floor and the chair is now clear 

00:02:09.060 --> 00:02:20.310
 Next, let's raise the area of the altar part of the back to the top of the whole 

00:02:14.400 --> 00:02:21.350
 This is the extent to which the viewer's comments were adopted. 

00:02:20.310 --> 00:02:26.870
 Better was 

00:02:21.350 --> 00:02:29.510
 But pipe organ and such fine facilities are not likely to be able to put such items 

00:02:26.870 --> 00:02:33.900
 It would be useful if there was a mod 

00:02:29.510 --> 00:02:38.750
 O there is also good and try to design your own with little block 

00:02:33.900 --> 00:02:43.790
 Because it takes too much time , I think of botos pace 

00:02:38.750 --> 00:02:48.159
 Birth is Once in now afloat is good up the idea something is for the time being without any 

00:02:43.790 --> 00:02:48.159
 Then let's do it quickly 

00:02:48.290 --> 00:02:55.990
 What may be like this 

00:02:50.500 --> 00:02:59.050
 By putting out the difference depending on the place and the thing like this feeling comes out 

00:02:55.990 --> 00:03:04.500
 It next is finally replacement of the wall 

00:02:59.050 --> 00:03:04.500
 It is better if the number is enough or not 

00:03:04.870 --> 00:03:11.670
 Yes All changed to the Nether quartz block 

00:03:08.890 --> 00:03:14.710
 It is another work content all cut 

00:03:11.670 --> 00:03:18.280
 It was a plain operation that only had to be replaced 

00:03:14.710 --> 00:03:22.110
 The pants of Yuuka Minagawa alone are enough 

00:03:18.280 --> 00:03:22.110
 Let's see from the center of birth 

00:03:24.500 --> 00:03:32.310
 You can now see it in a sacred place with the effect of Coatsblock 

00:03:28.860 --> 00:03:36.450
 Well I think the atmosphere has come out so much 

00:03:32.310 --> 00:03:41.430
 Because everything is important to the atmosphere and the situation 

00:03:36.450 --> 00:03:43.960
 Oh yes I adjusted the glass behind the altar to be visible at 10 o'clock 

00:03:41.430 --> 00:03:50.770
 It is what also was in a comment 

00:03:43.960 --> 00:03:53.820
 I thought is trying to make even Toka podium of the choir did Mai Flip be made after all once outside in it 

00:03:50.770 --> 00:03:53.820
 Or Let Mitemi out to 

00:03:54.190 --> 00:04:03.050
 Speaking of which there was a comment that the roof should be on Lapis Lazuli block 

00:03:58.850 --> 00:04:06.960
 I think the number is not enough, so the idea is another opportunity 

00:04:03.050 --> 00:04:11.750
 What about schools the top of the roof would change in time should the torch 

00:04:06.960 --> 00:04:16.170
 I was thinking about it, but I got a little hesitant to use the bonfire 

00:04:11.750 --> 00:04:22.460
 There was a comment saying that I put the base of colored glass, but what should I do? 

00:04:16.170 --> 00:04:22.460
 Because it is that it may increase the version it is the your story is pending 

00:04:22.860 --> 00:04:30.370
 Seen from above, this time is early, but let's end it 

00:04:27.330 --> 00:04:33.910
 This length reminds me of my first days 

00:04:30.370 --> 00:04:39.480
 The work time itself takes quite a while 

00:04:33.910 --> 00:04:42.090
 Well, this time there is a place where children feel and the atmosphere changes and there is something that looks like that. 

00:04:39.480 --> 00:04:45.180
 It looks like my industrial par from the sea 

00:04:42.090 --> 00:04:50.790
 Church construction will be completed for a while now 

00:04:45.180 --> 00:04:52.990
 There c'mon also likely to be renovated next time is for the plan to become the side's industrial videos 

00:04:50.790 --> 00:04:54.660
 You wish Regards 

00:04:52.990 --> 00:04:57.470
 Nice to meet you 

00:04:54.660 --> 00:05:03.060
 So let's end this time 

00:04:57.470 --> 00:05:05.690
 I thank you also were also next video to your watch you tired of so far 

00:05:03.060 --> 00:05:05.690
 Great 

00:05:21.139 --> 00:05:28.969
 Unit 2 Urakage p robot to make a lot of Casshern Casshern videos 

00:05:25.939 --> 00:05:33.230
 It is a great guy to post a lot of videos 

00:05:28.969 --> 00:05:38.120
 I renewed with a new pilot, thank you 

00:05:33.230 --> 00:05:39.320
 By Well then went to see if good because the propagandist's introduction and comments pickup previous 

00:05:38.120 --> 00:05:42.410
 Ne 

00:05:39.320 --> 00:05:48.340
 Gashan Nga Shang Oh Hi 

00:05:42.410 --> 00:05:53.220
 I am Kaoru Mizuse as an assistant . Then , it is the introduction of the previous proponents 

00:05:48.340 --> 00:05:57.930
 The last of advertising in sleepy 22 people 3,000 points 

00:05:53.220 --> 00:06:00.150
 Thank you a lot of advertising was the door 

00:05:57.930 --> 00:06:05.100
 It's dad that did accustomed seen Mabaru 

00:06:00.150 --> 00:06:08.400
 Because there are people who advertise in this way, we also feel motivated 

00:06:05.100 --> 00:06:14.790
 If it's not a serious direction, there is nothing to say 

00:06:08.400 --> 00:06:17.110
 Oh comment pickup without you, but is a little anecdote recently moving time is short this time 

00:06:14.790 --> 00:06:23.320
 I think some people feel that 

00:06:17.110 --> 00:06:25.560
 Because the concentration is disturbed for more than 5 minutes on account of the person who is editing the video, the video of a long time is 

00:06:23.320 --> 00:06:31.020
 It seems difficult to make 

00:06:25.560 --> 00:06:34.590
 If it becomes a movie of 10 minutes or more, there is also a significant decline in the image quality 

00:06:31.020 --> 00:06:39.689
 Video time seems to be within 10 minutes 

00:06:34.590 --> 00:06:43.319
 Now that it has become a long story, I will end with this 

00:06:39.689 --> 00:06:45.589
 Well, thank you again for your next video 

00:06:43.319 --> 00:06:45.589
 I guess
