00:00:00.760 --> 00:00:06.849
 well this all these that mission believe 

00:00:02.830 --> 00:00:09.490
 and this is another news you are seeing 

00:00:06.849 --> 00:00:13.030
 by the way the artistic design of cassis 

00:00:09.490 --> 00:00:16.260
 wick that has already been put and it reminds me 

00:00:13.030 --> 00:00:21.460
 to the game are agents removing that 

00:00:16.260 --> 00:00:23.800
 you have here the ugly fix is ​​ugly in 

00:00:21.460 --> 00:00:26.550
 As for QA Rank 1, which has now 

00:00:23.800 --> 00:00:31.240
 8 seconds of cool down and before I had 6 

00:00:26.550 --> 00:00:35.260
 It's worth the everest of 5 and it's back 

00:00:31.240 --> 00:00:39.670
 the q with six seconds down times 

00:00:35.260 --> 00:00:43.649
 when they had pulled it low 

00:00:39.670 --> 00:00:46.809
 7 with 5 to 7 vale 

00:00:43.649 --> 00:00:49.390
 but I guess it's to adjust it a 

00:00:46.809 --> 00:00:51.730
 little with our friend almost that to me 

00:00:49.390 --> 00:00:54.300
 like more renga the one that almost inside the 

00:00:51.730 --> 00:00:54.300
 nova was na 

00:00:55.579 --> 00:01:03.079
 and also changing the w at the beginning 

00:00:59.269 --> 00:01:06.860
 completely since a month or so 

00:01:03.079 --> 00:01:11.030
 the w gave twice as much armor as 

00:01:06.860 --> 00:01:13.340
 give now let's say and then they cooled it to 

00:01:11.030 --> 00:01:16.790
 half or so was thirty or so 

00:01:13.340 --> 00:01:18.649
 of armor rank five and now they have 

00:01:16.790 --> 00:01:22.220
 improved a little bit so they are not 

00:01:18.649 --> 00:01:25.270
 so action and 44 I think you cut 

00:01:22.220 --> 00:01:25.270
 Arango 5 

00:01:25.820 --> 00:01:30.050
 the damage they have not returned they lowered it and 

00:01:28.550 --> 00:01:33.530
 there he stays 

00:01:30.050 --> 00:01:35.240
 in short I think there are more people 

00:01:33.530 --> 00:01:36.220
 blows that in the end that comes but 

00:01:35.240 --> 00:01:39.730
 good 

00:01:36.220 --> 00:01:42.520
 I've done it there, you have six crush and 

00:01:39.730 --> 00:01:44.890
 here you have the artistic design of 

00:01:42.520 --> 00:01:46.610
 penta kill waves that you did not either 

00:01:44.890 --> 00:01:49.160

00:01:49.160 --> 00:01:55.310

00:01:52.340 --> 00:01:57.740

00:01:55.310 --> 00:02:00.670
