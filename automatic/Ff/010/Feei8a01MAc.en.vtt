00:00:03.410 --> 00:00:13.083
 We explain flow after arriving at Aone campground 

00:00:13.299 --> 00:00:19.209
 There is a reception on the right side of 1-BOX ahead. 

00:00:19.559 --> 00:00:26.680
 The procedure of stopping the car before the reception will be a nuisance to others. Please park your car in the front right parking lot and proceed. 

00:00:28.019 --> 00:00:38.110
 From the left side, cross the river to the camp site &amp; bungalow You can also buy sake, plastic bottle drinks, cup ramen, etc at the reception desk 

00:00:41.472 --> 00:00:48.511
 We maintain with heavy equipment because there is no way every time there is a large amount of water 

00:00:56.124 --> 00:01:03.515
 The road ahead is thin Do not slip into the river unless you pay attention to the speed is dobon 

00:01:06.086 --> 00:01:12.490
 This tree part is washed away well 

00:01:14.647 --> 00:01:18.069
 This left and right inter-forest site is a place-fighting battlefield and we can only put one pair at a time 

00:01:18.069 --> 00:01:25.680
 This slope is slippery with pebbles Handle operation and adjustment of the accelerator carefully 

00:01:28.746 --> 00:01:33.064
 Climb here to the left to access the new auto site 

00:01:37.037 --> 00:01:45.660
 On the left side, bungalows line up and turn left just before the first and second bungalows are popular 

00:01:48.677 --> 00:01:52.070
 The front is a kitchen 

00:01:51.798 --> 00:01:56.310
 Garbage dump on the left side 

00:02:00.184 --> 00:02:04.790
 It becomes the past auto site where the point opened from here 

00:02:06.250 --> 00:02:12.470
 We fill in from riverside site on the right side sequentially 

00:02:15.175 --> 00:02:18.630
 There is a toilet on the left side 

00:02:19.620 --> 00:02:33.310
 The front of this screen is north The site on the left mountain side The site on the center of the grassland The site on the right is the riverside site 

00:02:36.811 --> 00:02:44.550
 In this way, because the car usually runs between the sites, the site is full of dust, and the watering wheel is dispatched occasionally 

00:02:46.554 --> 00:02:50.640
 There is a place opened a little more on the left mountain side here 

00:02:52.719 --> 00:02:56.630
 The front bamboo forest site also feels good 

00:02:54.283 --> 00:03:00.970
 Here is the deepest
