throughout the night like over the
course<00:02:04.460> of<00:02:04.759> the<00:02:05.689> years<00:02:05.990> that<00:02:06.079> I<00:02:06.289> look<00:02:06.499> like

run across the lobby of rally and he

00:03:39.030 --> 00:03:41.780 
run across the lobby of rally and he
couldn't<00:03:39.299> explain<00:03:39.720> what<00:03:40.440> was<00:03:40.590> going<00:03:40.889> on<00:03:41.040> and

when<00:03:41.970> he<00:03:42.120> walked<00:03:42.620> to<00:03:43.620> where<00:03:44.069> the<00:03:44.250> little<00:03:44.519> boy

00:03:44.629 --> 00:03:44.639 
when he walked to where the little boy

00:03:44.639 --> 00:03:47.210 
when he walked to where the little boy
was<00:03:44.849> running<00:03:45.120> he<00:03:45.989> looked<00:03:46.230> both<00:03:46.500> ways<00:03:46.560> and<00:03:47.130> they

00:03:47.210 --> 00:03:47.220 
was running he looked both ways and they

00:03:47.220 --> 00:03:49.789

00:03:49.789 --> 00:03:49.799 
were both made out of walls so what we

00:03:49.799 --> 00:03:51.710 
were both made out of walls so what we
think<00:03:50.069> happened<00:03:50.669> is<00:03:50.760> as<00:03:50.910> a<00:03:50.940> ghost<00:03:51.239> in<00:03:51.480> rally

00:03:51.710 --> 00:03:51.720 
think happened is as a ghost in rally

00:03:51.720 --> 00:03:53.780 
think happened is as a ghost in rally
and<00:03:51.989> this<00:03:52.109> could<00:03:52.290> explain<00:03:52.650> the<00:03:53.220> noises<00:03:53.669> that

00:03:53.780 --> 00:03:53.790 
and this could explain the noises that

00:03:53.790 --> 00:03:58.010 
and this could explain the noises that
are<00:03:53.880> going<00:03:54.060> up<00:03:54.599> to<00:03:54.959> his<00:03:55.079> Butler<00:03:55.410> Hall<00:03:55.590> as<00:03:55.799> well
