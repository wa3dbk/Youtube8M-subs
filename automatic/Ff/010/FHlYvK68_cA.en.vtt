00:00:31.590 --> 00:00:34.580 
place and then open the door handle like
this<00:00:31.800> okay<00:00:32.700> so<00:00:32.730> we<00:00:33.480> I<00:00:33.510> just<00:00:33.750> replace<00:00:34.230> this<00:00:34.410> with

00:00:34.580 --> 00:00:34.590 
this okay so we I just replace this with

00:00:34.590 --> 00:00:35.920 
this okay so we I just replace this with
a<00:00:34.620> brand<00:00:34.920> new<00:00:35.040> one<00:00:35.160> that<00:00:35.370> we<00:00:35.700> actually

00:00:35.920 --> 00:00:35.930 
a brand new one that we actually

00:00:35.930 --> 00:00:38.510 
a brand new one that we actually
reinforced<00:00:36.930> the<00:00:37.079> inside<00:00:37.500> with<00:00:37.770> a<00:00:37.800> bunch<00:00:38.040> of<00:00:38.129> jb

00:00:38.510 --> 00:00:38.520 
reinforced the inside with a bunch of jb

00:00:38.520 --> 00:00:40.850 
reinforced the inside with a bunch of jb
weld<00:00:38.760> so<00:00:39.360> it'll<00:00:39.570> be<00:00:39.660> stronger<00:00:40.050> than<00:00:40.710> the

00:00:40.850 --> 00:00:40.860 
weld so it'll be stronger than the

00:00:40.860 --> 00:00:43.250 
weld so it'll be stronger than the
original<00:00:40.890> one<00:00:41.520> that<00:00:41.670> actually<00:00:42.090> failed<00:00:42.450> in<00:00:43.110> a

00:00:43.250 --> 00:00:43.260

00:00:43.260 --> 00:00:45.560 
original one that actually failed in a
second<00:00:43.649> here<00:00:43.800> I'll<00:00:43.890> show<00:00:44.100> you<00:00:44.129> how<00:00:44.730> we<00:00:45.149> got<00:00:45.420> the

panel<00:01:36.630> up<00:01:37.049> and<00:01:37.229> pull<00:01:37.829> it<00:01:37.950> out<00:01:38.100> and<00:01:38.400> you'll<00:01:38.909> have

00:01:38.990 --> 00:01:39.000 
panel up and pull it out and you'll have

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:41.600 
panel up and pull it out and you'll have
to<00:01:39.180> undo<00:01:39.570> a<00:01:39.600> cable<00:01:40.140> that's<00:01:40.439> clipped<00:01:40.950> onto<00:01:41.189> here

00:01:41.600 --> 00:01:41.610 
to undo a cable that's clipped onto here

00:01:41.610 --> 00:01:43.460 
to undo a cable that's clipped onto here
and<00:01:41.820> then<00:01:42.000> there's<00:01:42.180> electrical<00:01:42.899> connector<00:01:43.350> up

00:01:43.460 --> 00:01:43.470 
and then there's electrical connector up

in<00:01:43.619> this<00:01:43.740> area<00:01:44.009> that<00:01:44.280> you<00:01:44.369> have<00:01:44.460> to<00:01:44.579> pull<00:01:44.790> apart

00:01:44.870 --> 00:01:44.880 
in this area that you have to pull apart

00:01:44.880 --> 00:01:47.240 
in this area that you have to pull apart
and<00:01:45.329> then<00:01:45.450> the<00:01:45.540> whole<00:01:45.689> door<00:01:45.930> comes<00:01:46.200> away<00:01:46.470> now

00:01:47.240 --> 00:01:47.250 
and then the whole door comes away now

00:01:47.250 --> 00:01:50.120 
and then the whole door comes away now

00:02:13.369 --> 00:02:13.379 
bolts in the back that are just between

00:02:13.379 --> 00:02:13.949 
bolts in the back that are just between
the

00:02:13.949 --> 00:02:13.959 
the

00:02:13.959 --> 00:02:15.929 
the
cylinder<00:02:14.500> in<00:02:14.590> the<00:02:14.680> handle<00:02:15.040> mechanism<00:02:15.700> and

00:02:15.929 --> 00:02:15.939 
cylinder in the handle mechanism and

00:02:15.939 --> 00:02:18.149 
cylinder in the handle mechanism and
when<00:02:16.719> that's<00:02:16.870> broken<00:02:17.260> it's<00:02:17.560> easy<00:02:17.739> because<00:02:17.980> you

00:02:18.149 --> 00:02:18.159 
when that's broken it's easy because you

00:02:18.159 --> 00:02:20.119 
when that's broken it's easy because you
can<00:02:18.340> just<00:02:18.489> unscrew<00:02:18.939> them<00:02:19.209> from<00:02:19.480> the<00:02:19.599> outside

00:02:20.119 --> 00:02:20.129 
can just unscrew them from the outside

00:02:20.129 --> 00:02:22.679 
can just unscrew them from the outside
then<00:02:21.129> there's<00:02:21.310> a<00:02:21.400> linkage<00:02:21.700> rod<00:02:22.000> that<00:02:22.269> comes<00:02:22.510> up

00:02:22.679 --> 00:02:22.689 
then there's a linkage rod that comes up

00:02:22.689 --> 00:02:24.240 
then there's a linkage rod that comes up
from<00:02:22.840> the<00:02:22.930> door<00:02:23.140> latch<00:02:23.439> that<00:02:24.010> you<00:02:24.099> can

00:02:24.240 --> 00:02:24.250 
from the door latch that you can

00:02:24.250 --> 00:02:25.979 
from the door latch that you can
actually<00:02:24.519> push<00:02:24.790> out<00:02:24.969> the<00:02:25.180> opening<00:02:25.780> and

00:02:25.979 --> 00:02:25.989 
actually push out the opening and

00:02:25.989 --> 00:02:28.250 
actually push out the opening and
disengage<00:02:26.709> you<00:02:26.890> can't<00:02:27.099> twist<00:02:27.430> and<00:02:27.670> disengage

00:02:28.250 --> 00:02:28.260 
disengage you can't twist and disengage

00:02:28.260 --> 00:02:30.899 
disengage you can't twist and disengage
the<00:02:29.260> handle<00:02:29.739> on<00:02:29.890> the<00:02:29.920> outside<00:02:30.430> from<00:02:30.730> the

00:02:30.899 --> 00:02:30.909 
the handle on the outside from the

00:02:30.909 --> 00:02:32.610 
the handle on the outside from the
linkage<00:02:31.239> rod<00:02:31.510> then<00:02:31.780> the<00:02:31.900> whole<00:02:32.079> thing<00:02:32.349> comes

00:02:32.610 --> 00:02:32.620 
linkage rod then the whole thing comes

00:02:32.620 --> 00:02:34.440 
linkage rod then the whole thing comes
off<00:02:32.769> the<00:02:33.010> car<00:02:33.219> so<00:02:33.760> it's<00:02:33.909> really<00:02:34.030> not<00:02:34.180> too<00:02:34.420> bad

00:02:34.440 --> 00:02:34.450 
off the car so it's really not too bad

00:02:34.450 --> 00:02:36.780 
off the car so it's really not too bad
when<00:02:35.230> you<00:02:35.349> go<00:02:35.469> to<00:02:35.530> put<00:02:35.799> this<00:02:35.980> and<00:02:36.250> I'll<00:02:36.579> talk

00:03:09.069 --> 00:03:10.679 
re-engage those guides and so that's how
we<00:03:09.099> clip<00:03:09.489> this<00:03:09.639> door<00:03:09.909> back<00:03:10.090> together<00:03:10.299> so<00:03:10.629> it

00:03:10.679 --> 00:03:10.689 
we clip this door back together so it

00:03:10.689 --> 00:03:13.289 
we clip this door back together so it
would<00:03:10.780> be<00:03:10.900> solid<00:03:11.169> not<00:03:11.650> moving<00:03:12.040> around<00:03:12.299> and

00:03:13.289 --> 00:03:13.299 
would be solid not moving around and

00:03:13.299 --> 00:03:14.610 
would be solid not moving around and
that<00:03:13.510> worked<00:03:13.689> out<00:03:13.840> really<00:03:14.019> well<00:03:14.139> but<00:03:14.409> it<00:03:14.500> was

00:03:14.610 --> 00:03:14.620 
that worked out really well but it was

00:03:14.620 --> 00:03:16.890 
that worked out really well but it was
very<00:03:14.889> confusing<00:03:15.129> because<00:03:15.730> I<00:03:16.180> couldn't<00:03:16.750> really

00:03:16.890 --> 00:03:16.900 
very confusing because I couldn't really

00:03:16.900 --> 00:03:19.500 
very confusing because I couldn't really
tell<00:03:17.200> how<00:03:17.590> to<00:03:17.650> get<00:03:17.919> this<00:03:18.069> door<00:03:18.340> panel<00:03:18.879> off<00:03:19.090> and

00:03:19.500 --> 00:03:19.510 
tell how to get this door panel off and

00:03:19.510 --> 00:03:21.089 
tell how to get this door panel off and
I<00:03:19.569> couldn't<00:03:19.840> find<00:03:20.019> any<00:03:20.229> good<00:03:20.440> instructions

00:03:21.089 --> 00:03:21.099 
I couldn't find any good instructions

00:03:21.099 --> 00:03:22.619 
I couldn't find any good instructions
online<00:03:21.280> so<00:03:21.760> that's<00:03:21.940> why<00:03:22.090> I<00:03:22.120> created<00:03:22.239> this

00:03:22.619 --> 00:03:22.629 
online so that's why I created this

00:03:22.629 --> 00:03:25.319 
online so that's why I created this
video<00:03:22.989> and<00:03:23.340> now<00:03:24.340> in<00:03:24.579> the<00:03:24.729> next<00:03:24.970> video<00:03:25.209> I'm

00:03:25.319 --> 00:03:25.329

00:04:00.599 --> 00:04:00.609 
on the right is broken completely

00:04:00.609 --> 00:04:02.640 
on the right is broken completely
through<00:04:00.970> and

00:04:02.640 --> 00:04:02.650 
through and

00:04:02.650 --> 00:04:04.170

here<00:04:02.950> the<00:04:03.069> one<00:04:03.250> on<00:04:03.370> the<00:04:03.489> left<00:04:03.730> it's<00:04:03.970> got<00:04:04.150> a

00:04:04.170 --> 00:04:04.180 
here the one on the left it's got a

00:04:04.180 --> 00:04:07.020 
here the one on the left it's got a
pretty<00:04:04.420> significant<00:04:05.079> crack<00:04:05.470> in<00:04:05.769> it<00:04:05.920> and<00:04:06.790> what

00:04:07.020 --> 00:04:07.030 
pretty significant crack in it and what

00:04:07.030 --> 00:04:09.569 
pretty significant crack in it and what
happens<00:04:07.480> there<00:04:07.780> with<00:04:07.930> those<00:04:08.110> pieces<00:04:08.739> is<00:04:08.950> that

00:04:09.569 --> 00:04:09.579 
happens there with those pieces is that

00:04:09.579 --> 00:04:13.199 
happens there with those pieces is that
they<00:04:10.180> have<00:04:10.390> these<00:04:10.860> knurled<00:04:11.860> inserts<00:04:12.579> that<00:04:12.790> go

00:04:13.199 --> 00:04:13.209 
they have these knurled inserts that go

00:04:13.209 --> 00:04:15.030 
they have these knurled inserts that go
into<00:04:13.450> them<00:04:13.780> that<00:04:14.019> were<00:04:14.140> molded<00:04:14.650> into<00:04:14.890> them

00:04:15.030 --> 00:04:15.040 
into them that were molded into them

00:04:15.040 --> 00:04:17.430 
into them that were molded into them
that<00:04:15.280> the<00:04:15.879> bolts<00:04:16.299> hold<00:04:16.539> the<00:04:16.780> holding<00:04:17.139> the<00:04:17.259> door

00:04:17.430 --> 00:04:17.440 
that the bolts hold the holding the door

00:04:17.440 --> 00:04:19.740 
that the bolts hold the holding the door
handle<00:04:17.829> onto<00:04:17.979> the<00:04:18.220> car<00:04:18.459> go<00:04:18.669> through<00:04:18.970> and<00:04:19.329> these

00:04:19.740 --> 00:04:19.750 
handle onto the car go through and these

00:04:19.750 --> 00:04:23.790 
handle onto the car go through and these
inserts<00:04:20.199> pulled<00:04:20.560> out<00:04:20.739> when<00:04:22.080> these<00:04:23.080> plastic

00:04:23.790 --> 00:04:23.800 
inserts pulled out when these plastic

00:04:23.800 --> 00:04:27.150 
inserts pulled out when these plastic
pieces<00:04:24.150> broke<00:04:25.150> and<00:04:25.560> so<00:04:26.560> what<00:04:26.740> we<00:04:26.860> ended<00:04:27.039> up

00:04:27.150 --> 00:04:27.160 
pieces broke and so what we ended up

00:04:27.160 --> 00:04:29.820 
pieces broke and so what we ended up
doing<00:04:27.539> with<00:04:28.539> the<00:04:28.660> new<00:04:28.840> one<00:04:29.050> before<00:04:29.440> we<00:04:29.500> put<00:04:29.710> it

00:04:29.820 --> 00:04:29.830 
doing with the new one before we put it

00:04:29.830 --> 00:04:33.240 
doing with the new one before we put it
in<00:04:30.039> is<00:04:30.280> we<00:04:30.910> put<00:04:31.180> jb<00:04:31.660> weld<00:04:31.900> all<00:04:32.590> around<00:04:33.070> this

00:04:33.240 --> 00:04:33.250 
in is we put jb weld all around this

00:04:33.250 --> 00:04:34.800 
in is we put jb weld all around this
cavity<00:04:33.729> all<00:04:33.910> the<00:04:34.030> way<00:04:34.120> up<00:04:34.210> to<00:04:34.389> where<00:04:34.509> the<00:04:34.660> lock

00:04:34.800 --> 00:04:34.810 
cavity all the way up to where the lock

00:04:34.810 --> 00:04:36.810 
cavity all the way up to where the lock
cylinder<00:04:35.139> goes<00:04:35.500> in<00:04:35.830> and<00:04:36.100> completely

00:04:36.810 --> 00:04:36.820 
cylinder goes in and completely

00:04:36.820 --> 00:04:39.870 
cylinder goes in and completely
surrounded<00:04:37.630> these<00:04:37.840> plastic<00:04:38.440> pieces<00:04:38.710> with<00:04:39.520> j-b

00:04:39.870 --> 00:04:39.880 
surrounded these plastic pieces with j-b

00:04:39.880 --> 00:04:42.689 
surrounded these plastic pieces with j-b
weld<00:04:40.060> to<00:04:40.570> really<00:04:40.870> cement<00:04:41.139> them<00:04:41.560> in<00:04:41.710> place<00:04:41.979> and

00:04:42.689 --> 00:04:42.699 
weld to really cement them in place and

00:04:42.699 --> 00:04:44.250 
weld to really cement them in place and
give<00:04:42.880> them<00:04:43.000> a<00:04:43.030> lot<00:04:43.240> more<00:04:43.270> strength<00:04:43.900> so

00:04:44.250 --> 00:04:44.260 
give them a lot more strength so

00:04:44.260 --> 00:04:46.560 
give them a lot more strength so
hopefully<00:04:44.680> the<00:04:44.830> new<00:04:45.010> one<00:04:45.250> won't<00:04:46.030> break<00:04:46.330> and

00:04:46.560 --> 00:04:46.570 
hopefully the new one won't break and

00:04:46.570 --> 00:04:53.970 
hopefully the new one won't break and
crack<00:04:46.870> like<00:04:47.169> the<00:04:47.410> old<00:04:47.560> one<00:04:47.860> did

00:04:53.970 --> 00:04:53.980 

00:04:53.980 --> 00:04:58.590 

and<00:04:54.460> I<00:04:54.970> believe<00:04:55.330> that<00:04:56.370> we<00:04:57.370> can<00:04:57.400> repair<00:04:58.240> it

00:04:58.590 --> 00:04:58.600 
and I believe that we can repair it

00:04:58.600 --> 00:05:00.630 
and I believe that we can repair it
would<00:04:58.810> be<00:04:58.930> possible<00:04:59.440> to<00:04:59.500> repair<00:05:00.040> one<00:05:00.310> of<00:05:00.460> these

00:05:00.630 --> 00:05:00.640 
would be possible to repair one of these

00:05:00.640 --> 00:05:03.060 
would be possible to repair one of these
doing<00:05:01.450> that<00:05:01.600> same<00:05:01.840> kind<00:05:02.170> of<00:05:02.230> a<00:05:02.320> process<00:05:02.590> with

00:05:03.060 --> 00:05:03.070 
doing that same kind of a process with

00:05:03.070 --> 00:05:05.790 
doing that same kind of a process with
j-b<00:05:03.370> weld<00:05:03.550> as<00:05:04.060> we<00:05:04.690> put<00:05:05.050> on<00:05:05.140> the<00:05:05.260> new<00:05:05.440> one<00:05:05.650> to

00:05:05.790 --> 00:05:05.800 
j-b weld as we put on the new one to

00:05:05.800 --> 00:05:08.730 
j-b weld as we put on the new one to
reinforce<00:05:06.400> it<00:05:06.700> you<00:05:07.240> could<00:05:07.450> actually<00:05:07.740> put

00:05:08.730 --> 00:05:08.740 
reinforce it you could actually put

00:05:08.740 --> 00:05:16.830 
reinforce it you could actually put
these<00:05:08.950> inserts<00:05:09.520> back<00:05:09.940> in<00:05:15.240> it's<00:05:16.240> kind<00:05:16.630> of<00:05:16.690> hard

00:05:16.830 --> 00:05:16.840 
these inserts back in it's kind of hard

00:05:16.840 --> 00:05:21.600

you<00:05:38.080> know<00:05:38.170> certainly<00:05:38.770> I'm<00:05:39.160> not<00:05:39.400> positive<00:05:39.580> if

00:05:39.990 --> 00:05:40.000 
you know certainly I'm not positive if

00:05:40.000 --> 00:05:41.460 
you know certainly I'm not positive if
that's<00:05:40.180> going<00:05:40.420> to<00:05:40.480> hold<00:05:40.660> or<00:05:40.900> not<00:05:41.050> but<00:05:41.260> would<00:05:41.350> be

00:05:41.460 --> 00:05:41.470 
that's going to hold or not but would be

00:05:41.470 --> 00:05:43.020 
that's going to hold or not but would be
worth<00:05:41.650> a<00:05:41.830> try<00:05:42.100> if<00:05:42.310> you're<00:05:42.460> trying<00:05:42.700> to<00:05:42.760> do<00:05:42.910> this

00:05:43.020 --> 00:05:43.030 
worth a try if you're trying to do this

00:05:43.030 --> 00:05:46.470 
worth a try if you're trying to do this
without<00:05:43.150> buying<00:05:43.540> parts<00:05:43.930> and<00:05:44.880> if<00:05:45.880> you<00:05:46.270> are

without buying parts and if you are
buying<00:05:46.750> a<00:05:46.870> new<00:05:46.900> part<00:05:47.230> it's<00:05:47.620> definitely<00:05:48.340> worth

00:05:48.510 --> 00:05:48.520 
buying a new part it's definitely worth

00:05:48.520 --> 00:05:51.390 
buying a new part it's definitely worth
doing<00:05:48.790> that<00:05:48.970> before<00:05:49.300> you<00:05:49.780> install<00:05:50.110> it<00:05:50.590> so<00:05:50.800> that

00:05:51.390 --> 00:05:51.400 
doing that before you install it so that

00:05:51.400 --> 00:05:53.160 
doing that before you install it so that
these<00:05:51.580> things<00:05:51.790> don't<00:05:52.030> crack<00:05:52.390> out<00:05:52.630> and<00:05:52.930> break

00:05:53.160 --> 00:05:53.170 
these things don't crack out and break

00:05:53.170 --> 00:05:54.810 
these things don't crack out and break
out<00:05:53.350> like<00:05:53.500> this<00:05:53.710> over<00:05:53.980> time<00:05:54.190> like<00:05:54.640> the

00:05:54.810 --> 00:05:54.820 
out like this over time like the

00:05:54.820 --> 00:05:59.429 
out like this over time like the
original<00:05:55.270> one<00:05:55.450> did

00:05:59.429 --> 00:05:59.439 

00:05:59.439 --> 00:06:01.949

00:06:01.949 --> 00:06:01.959 
okay so when mixed up with j-b weld I

00:06:01.959 --> 00:06:04.649 
okay so when mixed up with j-b weld I
used<00:06:02.349> something<00:06:02.559> like<00:06:02.709> this<00:06:03.129> decking<00:06:03.789> nail<00:06:04.089> or

is not completely filled with a solid
block<00:06:50.949> of<00:06:51.219> jb<00:06:51.699> weld<00:06:52.139> so<00:06:53.139> you<00:06:53.229> can<00:06:53.499> see<00:06:53.769> how<00:06:54.729> that

00:06:54.779 --> 00:06:54.789 
block of jb weld so you can see how that

00:06:54.789 --> 00:06:57.419 
block of jb weld so you can see how that
looks<00:06:54.999> and<00:06:55.539> that<00:06:56.079> certainly<00:06:56.559> we<00:06:56.949> did<00:06:57.099> this<00:06:57.219> one

00:06:57.419 --> 00:06:57.429 
looks and that certainly we did this one

00:06:57.429 --> 00:06:59.609 
looks and that certainly we did this one
on<00:06:57.550> the<00:06:57.669> brand<00:06:57.909> new<00:06:58.119> one<00:06:58.329> to<00:06:58.989> provide<00:06:59.349> some

00:06:59.609 --> 00:06:59.619 
on the brand new one to provide some

00:06:59.619 --> 00:07:02.669 
on the brand new one to provide some
structural<00:07:00.099> support<00:07:00.159> for<00:07:00.879> the<00:07:01.479> you<00:07:02.439> know<00:07:02.499> the

00:07:02.669 --> 00:07:02.679 
structural support for the you know the

00:07:02.679 --> 00:07:04.259 
structural support for the you know the
new<00:07:02.860> handle<00:07:03.279> so<00:07:03.429> it<00:07:03.490> won't<00:07:03.699> break<00:07:03.879> like<00:07:04.119> the

00:07:04.259 --> 00:07:04.269 
new handle so it won't break like the

00:07:04.269 --> 00:07:06.689 
new handle so it won't break like the
old<00:07:04.419> one<00:07:04.659> did<00:07:04.869> and<00:07:05.050> will<00:07:05.169> crack<00:07:05.469> and<00:07:05.709> still<00:07:06.519> yet

00:07:06.689 --> 00:07:06.699 
old one did and will crack and still yet
