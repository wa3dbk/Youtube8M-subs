00:01:27.620 --> 00:01:27.630

00:01:27.630 --> 00:01:30.380 
unlocked so far I like angel goat pretty
much<00:01:27.810> pretty<00:01:28.740> good<00:01:28.950> too<00:01:29.189> pretty<00:01:29.670> well<00:01:29.909> I<00:01:30.180> guess

00:01:30.380 --> 00:01:30.390

would<00:01:30.630> be<00:01:30.659> more<00:01:30.930> proper<00:01:31.320> because<00:01:32.329> the<00:01:33.329> angel

00:01:33.649 --> 00:01:33.659 
would be more proper because the angel

00:01:33.659 --> 00:01:34.999 
would be more proper because the angel
goat<00:01:33.810> allows<00:01:34.079> you<00:01:34.259> to<00:01:34.470> kind<00:01:34.650> of<00:01:34.770> float<00:01:34.979> around

00:01:37.160 --> 00:01:37.170 
when you jump but it's a little bit

00:01:37.170 --> 00:01:39.740 
when you jump but it's a little bit
easier<00:01:37.500> to<00:01:37.590> control<00:01:38.189> than<00:01:38.850> the<00:01:39.329> feathered

00:01:39.740 --> 00:01:39.750 
easier to control than the feathered

00:01:56.359 --> 00:01:56.369 
you'll fly a lot further in the air plus

00:01:56.369 --> 00:01:58.550 
you'll fly a lot further in the air plus
it's<00:01:56.610> just<00:01:56.700> a<00:01:56.880> lot<00:01:57.030> more<00:01:57.210> fun<00:01:57.450> to<00:01:57.479> headbutt<00:01:57.990> all
