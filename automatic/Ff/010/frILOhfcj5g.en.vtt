00:00:54.020 --> 00:00:54.030 
battery life was much shorter but the

00:00:54.030 --> 00:00:55.790 
battery life was much shorter but the
good<00:00:54.210> thing<00:00:54.239> is<00:00:54.420> the<00:00:54.660> batteries<00:00:55.050> light<00:00:55.289> so<00:00:55.559> it

little<00:01:46.950> bit<00:01:47.130> because<00:01:47.340> i<00:01:47.490> used<00:01:47.939> the<00:01:48.630> the<00:01:48.869> top

00:01:49.069 --> 00:01:49.079 
little bit because i used the the top

00:01:49.079 --> 00:01:52.249 
little bit because i used the the top
row<00:01:49.350> a<00:01:49.649> lot<00:01:50.220> and<00:01:50.750> it<00:01:51.750> bothered<00:01:52.079> me<00:01:52.170> a<00:01:52.200> little

00:01:52.249 --> 00:01:52.259 
row a lot and it bothered me a little

00:01:52.259 --> 00:01:54.109 
row a lot and it bothered me a little
bit<00:01:52.409> but<00:01:52.560> i<00:01:52.619> know<00:01:52.770> i<00:01:52.979> could<00:01:53.310> have<00:01:53.399> gotten<00:01:53.549> used

00:01:54.109 --> 00:01:54.119 
bit but i know i could have gotten used

00:01:54.119 --> 00:01:57.950 
bit but i know i could have gotten used
to<00:01:54.360> it<00:01:54.829> the<00:01:55.829> trackpad<00:01:56.340> trackpad<00:01:57.000> isn't<00:01:57.479> as<00:01:57.689> big

00:01:57.950 --> 00:01:57.960 
to it the trackpad trackpad isn't as big

00:01:57.960 --> 00:02:00.859 
to it the trackpad trackpad isn't as big
as<00:01:58.259> the<00:01:58.560> all<00:01:58.890> the<00:01:59.040> other<00:01:59.189> track<00:01:59.430> pads<00:01:59.700> in<00:01:59.969> the

as the all the other track pads in the
Apple<00:02:01.170> lineup<00:02:01.530> but<00:02:02.159> you<00:02:02.549> can<00:02:02.729> get<00:02:02.850> away<00:02:02.939> with

00:02:03.139 --> 00:02:03.149 
Apple lineup but you can get away with

00:02:03.149 --> 00:02:06.410 
Apple lineup but you can get away with
it<00:02:03.979> storage<00:02:04.979> this<00:02:05.340> was<00:02:05.700> my<00:02:05.820> biggest<00:02:06.030> problem

00:02:06.410 --> 00:02:06.420 
it storage this was my biggest problem

00:02:06.420 --> 00:02:08.990 
it storage this was my biggest problem
with<00:02:06.450> his<00:02:06.659> 11<00:02:06.960> air<00:02:07.079> was<00:02:07.619> storage<00:02:08.160> there<00:02:08.489> wasn't

00:02:08.990 --> 00:02:09.000 
with his 11 air was storage there wasn't

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:12.080 
with his 11 air was storage there wasn't
enough<00:02:09.539> storage<00:02:10.410> I<00:02:10.770> did<00:02:11.220> pick<00:02:11.430> the<00:02:11.489> bottom<00:02:11.940> an

00:02:12.080 --> 00:02:12.090 
enough storage I did pick the bottom an

00:02:12.090 --> 00:02:13.850 
enough storage I did pick the bottom an
64<00:02:12.720> gigabyte<00:02:13.140> now<00:02:13.349> I<00:02:13.379> think<00:02:13.680> I<00:02:13.709> would<00:02:13.800> have

00:02:13.850 --> 00:02:13.860 
64 gigabyte now I think I would have

00:02:13.860 --> 00:02:15.650 
64 gigabyte now I think I would have
gotten<00:02:14.040> away<00:02:14.129> with<00:02:14.400> it<00:02:14.430> if<00:02:14.610> I<00:02:14.760> if<00:02:15.000> I<00:02:15.180> pick<00:02:15.420> the

00:02:15.650 --> 00:02:15.660 
gotten away with it if I if I pick the

00:02:15.660 --> 00:02:19.910 
gotten away with it if I if I pick the
128<00:02:16.230> but<00:02:17.069> I<00:02:17.599> I<00:02:18.599> couldn't<00:02:19.140> keep<00:02:19.290> my<00:02:19.349> iPhoto

anyway<00:05:45.180> right<00:05:45.930> before<00:05:46.080> I<00:05:46.260> I<00:05:46.919> stuck<00:05:47.400> that<00:05:47.430> USB

00:05:47.839 --> 00:05:47.849 
anyway right before I I stuck that USB

00:05:47.849 --> 00:05:50.120 
anyway right before I I stuck that USB
right<00:05:48.570> in<00:05:48.720> the<00:05:48.810> macbook<00:05:48.990> air<00:05:49.320> I<00:05:49.500> looked<00:05:49.860> at<00:05:49.979> the

00:05:50.120 --> 00:05:50.130 
right in the macbook air I looked at the

00:05:50.130 --> 00:05:51.620 
right in the macbook air I looked at the
at<00:05:50.370> the<00:05:50.430> back<00:05:50.639> of<00:05:50.669> it<00:05:50.849> and<00:05:51.000> it<00:05:51.300> looks<00:05:51.570> like

00:05:51.620 --> 00:05:51.630 
at the back of it and it looks like

00:05:51.630 --> 00:05:53.960 
at the back of it and it looks like
somebody<00:05:52.080> already<00:05:52.139> used<00:05:52.800> this<00:05:53.039> USB<00:05:53.460> so<00:05:53.729> I<00:05:53.759> got

00:05:53.960 --> 00:05:53.970 
somebody already used this USB so I got

00:05:53.970 --> 00:05:56.990 
somebody already used this USB so I got
a<00:05:54.000> feeling<00:05:54.419> that<00:05:55.340> somebody<00:05:56.340> from<00:05:56.729> the

00:05:56.990 --> 00:05:57.000 
a feeling that somebody from the

00:05:57.000 --> 00:05:58.700 
a feeling that somebody from the
somebody<00:05:57.659> return<00:05:57.990> this<00:05:58.169> to<00:05:58.320> the<00:05:58.409> apple<00:05:58.680> store

00:05:58.700 --> 00:05:58.710 
somebody return this to the apple store

00:05:58.710 --> 00:06:00.019 
somebody return this to the apple store
told<00:05:59.010> him<00:05:59.159> it's<00:05:59.279> still<00:05:59.460> brand<00:05:59.610> new<00:05:59.760> never

00:06:00.019 --> 00:06:00.029 
told him it's still brand new never

00:06:00.029 --> 00:06:02.209 
told him it's still brand new never
booted<00:06:00.599> and<00:06:00.719> I<00:06:01.500> guess<00:06:01.650> they<00:06:01.770> believed<00:06:02.070> them

00:06:02.209 --> 00:06:02.219 
booted and I guess they believed them

00:06:02.219 --> 00:06:04.129 
booted and I guess they believed them
and

00:06:04.129 --> 00:06:04.139 
and

00:06:04.139 --> 00:06:06.260 
and
that's<00:06:04.259> for<00:06:04.499> the<00:06:04.560> final<00:06:04.860> word<00:06:05.039> I<00:06:05.370> suggest<00:06:06.090> that

00:06:06.260 --> 00:06:06.270 
that's for the final word I suggest that

00:06:06.270 --> 00:06:09.290 
that's for the final word I suggest that
if<00:06:06.629> you're<00:06:06.840> a<00:06:06.900> power<00:06:07.259> user<00:06:07.379> do<00:06:08.280> not<00:06:08.550> have<00:06:09.060> an

00:06:09.290 --> 00:06:09.300 
if you're a power user do not have an

00:06:09.300 --> 00:06:12.379 
if you're a power user do not have an
11-inch<00:06:09.870> macbook<00:06:10.229> air<00:06:10.409> as<00:06:10.560> your<00:06:10.919> only<00:06:11.389> machine

00:06:12.379 --> 00:06:12.389 
11-inch macbook air as your only machine

00:06:12.389 --> 00:06:13.879 
11-inch macbook air as your only machine
now<00:06:12.779> I<00:06:12.810> think<00:06:12.960> it's<00:06:13.139> fine<00:06:13.349> to<00:06:13.379> have<00:06:13.560> it<00:06:13.770> as<00:06:13.860> a

00:06:13.879 --> 00:06:13.889 
now I think it's fine to have it as a

00:06:13.889 --> 00:06:15.920 
now I think it's fine to have it as a
secondary<00:06:14.099> machine<00:06:14.729> but<00:06:15.449> you<00:06:15.749> should<00:06:15.779> have

00:06:15.920 --> 00:06:15.930 
secondary machine but you should have

00:06:15.930 --> 00:06:17.689 
secondary machine but you should have
you<00:06:16.499> know<00:06:16.529> a<00:06:16.620> more<00:06:16.830> powerful<00:06:17.009> machine<00:06:17.520> than

00:06:17.689 --> 00:06:17.699 
you know a more powerful machine than

00:06:17.699 --> 00:06:21.739 
you know a more powerful machine than
the<00:06:18.150> 11<00:06:18.419> air<00:06:18.599> and<00:06:19.610> the<00:06:20.610> portability<00:06:20.939> is<00:06:21.180> nice<00:06:21.479> I

00:06:21.739 --> 00:06:21.749 
the 11 air and the portability is nice I

00:06:21.749 --> 00:06:23.330 
the 11 air and the portability is nice I
brought<00:06:21.930> it<00:06:22.080> absolutely<00:06:22.529> everywhere<00:06:23.129> with<00:06:23.310> me

00:06:23.330 --> 00:06:23.340 
brought it absolutely everywhere with me

00:06:23.340 --> 00:06:27.769 
brought it absolutely everywhere with me
you<00:06:24.150> know<00:06:24.469> everywhere<00:06:25.469> I<00:06:26.539> don't<00:06:27.539> know<00:06:27.599> what

00:06:27.769 --> 00:06:27.779

00:06:29.390 --> 00:06:29.400 
how else I can explain everywhere but

00:06:29.400 --> 00:06:33.170 
how else I can explain everywhere but
everywhere<00:06:30.120> and<00:06:30.560> I<00:06:31.560> suggest<00:06:32.520> you<00:06:32.610> wait<00:06:32.849> for<00:06:33.150> a

just get a thunderbolt hard drive you
know<00:07:16.919> it<00:07:17.039> doesn't<00:07:17.159> it<00:07:17.490> doesn't<00:07:17.520> it<00:07:18.080> has<00:07:19.080> less

00:07:19.369 --> 00:07:19.379 
know it doesn't it doesn't it has less

00:07:19.379 --> 00:07:20.540 
know it doesn't it doesn't it has less
