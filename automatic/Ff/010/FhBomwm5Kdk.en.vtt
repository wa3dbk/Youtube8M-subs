3 infernos in the next video or some

00:00:38.850 --> 00:00:41.090 
3 infernos in the next video or some
upcoming<00:00:39.239> video<00:00:39.530> so<00:00:40.530> you<00:00:40.590> see<00:00:40.800> there's<00:00:40.980> no

00:00:42.680 --> 00:00:42.690 
change to that but you do see this new

00:00:42.690 --> 00:00:44.959 
change to that but you do see this new
button<00:00:42.719> says<00:00:43.260> single<00:00:43.649> single<00:00:44.489> and<00:00:44.670> multiple

00:00:44.959 --> 00:00:44.969 
button says single single and multiple

00:00:44.969 --> 00:00:47.000 
button says single single and multiple
yep<00:00:45.570> so<00:00:45.870> you<00:00:45.899> switch<00:00:46.140> modes<00:00:46.379> between<00:00:46.500> single

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:47.010 
yep so you switch modes between single

00:00:47.010 --> 00:00:48.590 
yep so you switch modes between single
multiple<00:00:47.399> and<00:00:47.610> changes<00:00:48.030> from<00:00:48.180> that<00:00:48.329> ball

00:00:48.590 --> 00:00:48.600 
multiple and changes from that ball

00:00:48.600 --> 00:00:50.810 
multiple and changes from that ball
right<00:00:48.809> there<00:00:48.840> that<00:00:49.260> shoots<00:00:49.440> up<00:00:49.559> to<00:00:49.620> five<00:00:50.039> beams

00:00:50.810 --> 00:00:50.820 
right there that shoots up to five beams

00:00:50.820 --> 00:00:53.750 
right there that shoots up to five beams
to<00:00:51.570> five<00:00:51.750> enemy<00:00:52.050> targets<00:00:52.410> to<00:00:53.219> this<00:00:53.370> one<00:00:53.610> which

00:00:53.750 --> 00:00:53.760 
to five enemy targets to this one which

00:00:53.760 --> 00:00:55.310 
to five enemy targets to this one which
is<00:00:53.879> just<00:00:54.120> a<00:00:54.239> regular<00:00:54.390> single<00:00:54.899> beam<00:00:55.079> now

00:00:55.310 --> 00:00:55.320 
is just a regular single beam now

00:00:55.320 --> 00:00:56.959 
is just a regular single beam now
there's<00:00:55.590> a<00:00:55.680> big<00:00:55.890> difference<00:00:56.309> the<00:00:56.520> single<00:00:56.820> beam

00:00:56.959 --> 00:00:56.969 
there's a big difference the single beam

00:00:56.969 --> 00:00:59.209 
there's a big difference the single beam
is<00:00:57.120> obviously<00:00:57.559> levels<00:00:58.559> up<00:00:58.710> as<00:00:58.890> the<00:00:59.010> time<00:00:59.190> moves

00:00:59.209 --> 00:00:59.219 
is obviously levels up as the time moves

00:00:59.219 --> 00:01:01.099 
is obviously levels up as the time moves
on<00:00:59.609> you<00:00:59.850> know<00:00:59.969> from<00:01:00.149> 50<00:01:00.420> points<00:01:00.809> all<00:01:00.989> the<00:01:01.079> way

00:01:01.099 --> 00:01:01.109 
on you know from 50 points all the way

00:01:01.109 --> 00:01:04.130 
on you know from 50 points all the way
to<00:01:01.640> 1400<00:01:02.640> on<00:01:02.760> the<00:01:02.969> new<00:01:03.120> low<00:01:03.270> 3<00:01:03.570> inferno

00:01:04.130 --> 00:01:04.140 
to 1400 on the new low 3 inferno

00:01:04.140 --> 00:01:06.830 
to 1400 on the new low 3 inferno
while<00:01:04.769> this<00:01:05.280> multiple<00:01:05.820> target<00:01:06.119> 1<00:01:06.299> is<00:01:06.510> very

00:01:06.830 --> 00:01:06.840 
while this multiple target 1 is very

00:01:06.840 --> 00:01:09.109 
while this multiple target 1 is very
very<00:01:07.200> effective<00:01:07.740> against<00:01:08.280> minions<00:01:08.850> and

00:01:09.109 --> 00:01:09.119 
very effective against minions and

00:01:09.119 --> 00:01:11.390 
very effective against minions and
balloons<00:01:09.750> because<00:01:10.320> believe<00:01:10.710> it<00:01:10.799> or<00:01:10.860> not<00:01:10.979> I<00:01:11.220> saw

00:01:11.390 --> 00:01:11.400 
balloons because believe it or not I saw

00:01:11.400 --> 00:01:13.280 
balloons because believe it or not I saw
some<00:01:11.610> replays<00:01:12.030> of<00:01:12.270> minions<00:01:12.689> attacking<00:01:13.170> other

00:01:13.280 --> 00:01:13.290 
some replays of minions attacking other

00:01:13.290 --> 00:01:16.190 
some replays of minions attacking other
people<00:01:13.380> and<00:01:13.860> this<00:01:14.729> set<00:01:15.479> up<00:01:15.630> of<00:01:15.810> multiple

00:01:16.190 --> 00:01:16.200 
people and this set up of multiple

00:01:16.200 --> 00:01:18.469 
people and this set up of multiple
targets<00:01:16.799> on<00:01:16.979> the<00:01:17.310> Inferno<00:01:17.580> tower<00:01:17.790> is<00:01:18.060> really

00:01:18.469 --> 00:01:18.479 
targets on the Inferno tower is really

00:01:18.479 --> 00:01:20.660 
targets on the Inferno tower is really
really<00:01:18.659> effective<00:01:19.170> so<00:01:19.710> pretty<00:01:19.920> much<00:01:20.070> this<00:01:20.460> is

00:01:20.660 --> 00:01:20.670 
really effective so pretty much this is

00:01:20.670 --> 00:01:22.399 
really effective so pretty much this is
the<00:01:20.700> setup<00:01:21.090> for<00:01:21.270> farming<00:01:21.689> or<00:01:21.840> like<00:01:22.020> maybe

00:01:22.399 --> 00:01:22.409 
the setup for farming or like maybe

00:01:22.409 --> 00:01:26.300 
the setup for farming or like maybe
master<00:01:22.920> 3<00:01:23.369> Grange<00:01:23.729> but<00:01:24.030> up<00:01:24.420> here<00:01:24.450> in<00:01:25.310> the

00:01:26.300 --> 00:01:26.310 
master 3 Grange but up here in the

00:01:26.310 --> 00:01:29.960 
master 3 Grange but up here in the
Champions<00:01:27.030> League<00:01:27.210> more<00:01:28.140> of<00:01:28.259> the<00:01:28.700> 3000<00:01:29.700> trophy

00:01:29.960 --> 00:01:29.970 
Champions League more of the 3000 trophy

00:01:29.970 --> 00:01:31.730 
Champions League more of the 3000 trophy
range<00:01:30.240> that's<00:01:30.600> really<00:01:31.079> where<00:01:31.229> people<00:01:31.650> are

00:01:31.730 --> 00:01:31.740 
range that's really where people are

00:01:31.740 --> 00:01:33.830 
range that's really where people are
only<00:01:31.950> setting<00:01:32.400> it<00:01:32.520> to<00:01:32.729> single<00:01:33.270> because<00:01:33.570> of<00:01:33.750> the

00:01:33.830 --> 00:01:33.840 
only setting it to single because of the

00:01:33.840 --> 00:01:36.830 
only setting it to single because of the
goals<00:01:34.079> of<00:01:34.439> the<00:01:34.619> pekka's<00:01:35.040> and<00:01:35.509> heroes<00:01:36.509> those

00:01:36.830 --> 00:01:36.840 
goals of the pekka's and heroes those

00:01:36.840 --> 00:01:38.990 
goals of the pekka's and heroes those
are<00:01:37.049> really<00:01:37.530> powerful<00:01:37.710> troops<00:01:38.189> and<00:01:38.430> the

00:01:38.990 --> 00:01:39.000 
are really powerful troops and the

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:40.580 
are really powerful troops and the
multiple<00:01:39.329> target<00:01:39.689> range<00:01:39.840> will<00:01:40.049> not<00:01:40.200> really<00:01:40.500> be

00:01:40.580 --> 00:01:40.590 
multiple target range will not really be

00:01:40.590 --> 00:01:43.249 
multiple target range will not really be
useful<00:01:41.280> against<00:01:41.579> it<00:01:41.700> so<00:01:42.299> sorry<00:01:42.600> go<00:01:42.780> ahead<00:01:42.810> and

00:01:43.249 --> 00:01:43.259 
useful against it so sorry go ahead and

00:01:43.259 --> 00:01:46.190 
useful against it so sorry go ahead and
look<00:01:43.530> at<00:01:43.680> the<00:01:44.399> low<00:01:45.240> 3<00:01:45.479> inferno<00:01:45.840> which<00:01:45.990> is<00:01:46.079> going

00:01:46.190 --> 00:01:46.200 
look at the low 3 inferno which is going

00:01:46.200 --> 00:01:48.050 
look at the low 3 inferno which is going
to<00:01:46.259> visit<00:01:46.350> a<00:01:46.560> top<00:01:46.799> player<00:01:47.040> here<00:01:47.340> in<00:01:47.430> a<00:01:47.520> second

00:01:48.050 --> 00:01:48.060 
to visit a top player here in a second

00:01:48.060 --> 00:01:50.030 
to visit a top player here in a second
so<00:01:48.659> there<00:01:48.840> are<00:01:48.930> little<00:01:49.110> threes<00:01:49.380> you<00:01:49.619> see<00:01:49.890> the

00:01:50.030 --> 00:01:50.040 
so there are little threes you see the

00:01:50.040 --> 00:01:52.010

00:03:43.460 --> 00:03:43.470 
fire or has to do with lava but didn't

00:03:43.470 --> 00:03:45.469 
fire or has to do with lava but didn't
really<00:03:43.560> get<00:03:44.190> snow<00:03:44.489> effect<00:03:44.819> on<00:03:44.970> it<00:03:45.120> other<00:03:45.299> than

00:03:45.469 --> 00:03:45.479 
really get snow effect on it other than

00:03:45.479 --> 00:03:47.210 
really get snow effect on it other than
the<00:03:45.599> Town<00:03:45.810> Hall<00:03:46.109> obviously<00:03:46.709> the<00:03:46.829> Town<00:03:47.010> Hall

00:03:47.210 --> 00:03:47.220

the Town Hall obviously the Town Hall
looks<00:03:47.609> beautiful<00:03:48.269> so<00:03:48.510> I<00:03:48.780> don't<00:03:49.199> see<00:03:49.379> the

00:03:49.879 --> 00:03:49.889 
looks beautiful so I don't see the

00:03:49.889 --> 00:03:51.589 
looks beautiful so I don't see the
reason<00:03:50.190> to<00:03:50.220> not<00:03:50.489> cover<00:03:50.760> it<00:03:50.940> in<00:03:51.090> snow

00:03:51.589 --> 00:03:51.599 
reason to not cover it in snow

00:03:51.599 --> 00:03:54.080 
reason to not cover it in snow
alright<00:03:52.530> so<00:03:52.859> apart<00:03:53.129> from<00:03:53.250> that<00:03:53.400> there<00:03:53.699> is<00:03:53.819> one

00:03:54.080 --> 00:03:54.090 
alright so apart from that there is one

00:03:54.090 --> 00:03:56.689 
alright so apart from that there is one
special<00:03:54.419> trap<00:03:55.229> I<00:03:55.379> guess<00:03:55.620> bomb<00:03:56.010> whatever<00:03:56.609> you

00:03:56.689 --> 00:03:56.699 
special trap I guess bomb whatever you

special trap I guess bomb whatever you
wanna<00:03:56.819> call<00:03:56.879> it<00:03:57.030> and<00:03:57.299> that<00:03:57.780> is<00:03:57.930> the<00:03:58.079> Santa's

00:04:00.170 --> 00:04:00.180 
present it is right there my base I'll

00:04:00.180 --> 00:04:01.670 
present it is right there my base I'll
explain<00:04:00.419> it<00:04:00.599> why<00:04:00.720> I<00:04:00.750> put<00:04:00.989> it<00:04:01.019> here<00:04:01.229> the<00:04:01.440> reason

00:04:01.670 --> 00:04:01.680 
explain it why I put it here the reason

00:04:01.680 --> 00:04:04.189 
explain it why I put it here the reason
is<00:04:01.829> is<00:04:02.040> actually<00:04:02.879> what<00:04:02.970> happens<00:04:03.329> is<00:04:03.479> a<00:04:03.540> Santa

is is actually what happens is a Santa
comes<00:04:04.500> across<00:04:04.680> your<00:04:04.889> village<00:04:05.250> once<00:04:05.519> an<00:04:06.329> enemy

00:04:06.469 --> 00:04:06.479 
comes across your village once an enemy

00:04:06.479 --> 00:04:09.140 
comes across your village once an enemy
steps<00:04:06.900> inside<00:04:07.260> that<00:04:07.530> circle<00:04:07.949> and<00:04:08.340> he<00:04:08.879> drops

00:04:09.140 --> 00:04:09.150 
steps inside that circle and he drops

00:04:09.150 --> 00:04:11.539 
steps inside that circle and he drops
presents<00:04:09.629> on<00:04:09.750> them<00:04:09.959> which<00:04:10.139> explode<00:04:10.590> but<00:04:11.190> they

00:04:11.539 --> 00:04:11.549 
presents on them which explode but they

00:04:11.549 --> 00:04:13.250 
presents on them which explode but they
also<00:04:11.699> are<00:04:11.909> left<00:04:12.150> behind<00:04:12.299> and<00:04:12.750> I<00:04:12.810> believe<00:04:13.109> they

00:04:13.250 --> 00:04:13.260 
also are left behind and I believe they

00:04:13.260 --> 00:04:16.520
