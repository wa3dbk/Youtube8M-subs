other<00:00:30.480> things<00:00:30.750> that<00:00:30.810> we<00:00:30.990> play<00:00:31.170> a<00:00:31.199> lot<00:00:31.439> when

00:00:31.609 --> 00:00:31.619 
other things that we play a lot when

00:00:31.619 --> 00:00:34.160 
other things that we play a lot when
we're<00:00:31.800> playing<00:00:31.980> country<00:00:32.399> guitar<00:00:32.850> a<00:00:33.170> double

00:00:34.160 --> 00:00:34.170 
we're playing country guitar a double

00:00:34.170 --> 00:00:35.840 
we're playing country guitar a double
stop<00:00:34.320> is<00:00:34.500> any<00:00:34.649> time<00:00:34.860> we<00:00:35.010> play<00:00:35.190> two<00:00:35.250> notes<00:00:35.430> at

00:00:35.840 --> 00:00:35.850 
stop is any time we play two notes at

00:00:35.850 --> 00:00:38.900 
stop is any time we play two notes at
the<00:00:35.910> same<00:00:36.000> time<00:00:36.829> from<00:00:37.829> different<00:00:38.010> strings<00:00:38.550> so

00:00:38.900 --> 00:00:38.910 
the same time from different strings so

00:00:38.910 --> 00:00:41.090 
the same time from different strings so
that's<00:00:39.450> a<00:00:39.570> double<00:00:39.809> stop<00:00:40.020> it's<00:00:40.620> a<00:00:40.739> double<00:00:40.980> so

00:00:41.090 --> 00:00:41.100 
that's a double stop it's a double so

00:00:41.100 --> 00:00:43.639 
that's a double stop it's a double so
that's<00:00:41.790> a<00:00:41.910> double<00:00:42.180> stop<00:00:42.390> that's<00:00:43.050> the<00:00:43.200> stuff

00:00:43.639 --> 00:00:43.649 
that's a double stop that's the stuff

00:00:43.649 --> 00:00:44.840 
that's a double stop that's the stuff
and<00:00:43.890> that's<00:00:44.010> the<00:00:44.100> double<00:00:44.309> stop<00:00:44.489> it<00:00:44.670> doesn't

00:00:44.840 --> 00:00:44.850 
and that's the double stop it doesn't

00:00:44.850 --> 00:00:46.100 
and that's the double stop it doesn't
matter<00:00:45.059> if<00:00:45.180> the<00:00:45.270> strings<00:00:45.510> are<00:00:45.570> right<00:00:45.750> next<00:00:46.020> to

00:00:46.100 --> 00:00:46.110 
matter if the strings are right next to

00:00:46.110 --> 00:00:48.350 
matter if the strings are right next to
each<00:00:46.200> other<00:00:46.350> or<00:00:46.860> if<00:00:47.489> they're<00:00:47.760> not<00:00:48.000> right<00:00:48.210> next

00:00:48.350 --> 00:00:48.360 
each other or if they're not right next

00:00:48.360 --> 00:00:49.700 
each other or if they're not right next
to<00:00:48.600> each<00:00:48.690> other<00:00:48.840> as<00:00:49.230> long<00:00:49.289> as<00:00:49.559> we're<00:00:49.680> playing

00:00:49.700 --> 00:00:49.710 
to each other as long as we're playing

00:00:49.710 --> 00:00:52.910 
to each other as long as we're playing
two<00:00:50.129> notes<00:00:50.160> from<00:00:50.969> two<00:00:51.149> different<00:00:51.510> strings<00:00:51.920> at

00:00:52.910 --> 00:00:52.920 
two notes from two different strings at

00:00:52.920 --> 00:00:55.130 
two notes from two different strings at
the<00:00:52.949> same<00:00:53.219> time<00:00:53.539> that's<00:00:54.539> called<00:00:54.750> the<00:00:54.870> double

00:00:55.130 --> 00:00:55.140 
the same time that's called the double

00:00:55.140 --> 00:00:57.680 
the same time that's called the double
stop<00:00:55.820> so<00:00:56.820> what<00:00:57.000> we're<00:00:57.149> gonna<00:00:57.270> do<00:00:57.480> is<00:00:57.600> we're

00:00:57.680 --> 00:00:57.690 
stop so what we're gonna do is we're

00:00:57.690 --> 00:01:00.080 
stop so what we're gonna do is we're
gonna<00:00:57.750> learn<00:00:58.020> one<00:00:58.440> double<00:00:58.829> stop<00:00:59.100> lick<00:00:59.579> that

00:01:00.080 --> 00:01:00.090 
gonna learn one double stop lick that

00:01:00.090 --> 00:01:01.790 
gonna learn one double stop lick that
can<00:01:00.239> be<00:01:00.329> played<00:01:00.539> over<00:01:00.840> an<00:01:00.960> a<00:01:01.109> chord<00:01:01.410> and<00:01:01.590> then

00:01:01.790 --> 00:01:01.800 
can be played over an a chord and then

00:01:01.800 --> 00:01:04.219 
can be played over an a chord and then
we're<00:01:01.949> also<00:01:02.100> going<00:01:02.309> to<00:01:02.370> apply<00:01:02.609> it<00:01:02.670> to<00:01:02.960> D<00:01:03.960> chord

00:01:04.219 --> 00:01:04.229 
we're also going to apply it to D chord

00:01:04.229 --> 00:01:05.899 
we're also going to apply it to D chord
and<00:01:04.439> an<00:01:04.589> E<00:01:04.710> chord<00:01:04.739> so<00:01:05.100> we<00:01:05.159> can<00:01:05.309> basically<00:01:05.519> use

00:01:05.899 --> 00:01:05.909 
and an E chord so we can basically use

00:01:05.909 --> 00:01:07.429 
and an E chord so we can basically use
this<00:01:06.150> lick<00:01:06.450> that<00:01:06.630> we<00:01:06.780> learned<00:01:06.990> to<00:01:07.140> get<00:01:07.229> through

00:01:07.429 --> 00:01:07.439 
this lick that we learned to get through

00:01:07.439 --> 00:01:09.649 
this lick that we learned to get through
a<00:01:07.500> one<00:01:07.740> four<00:01:08.010> five<00:01:08.250> blues<00:01:08.700> jam<00:01:09.000> which<00:01:09.479> we'll

00:01:09.649 --> 00:01:09.659 
a one four five blues jam which we'll

00:01:09.659 --> 00:01:11.390 
a one four five blues jam which we'll
play<00:01:09.840> along<00:01:10.080> with<00:01:10.229> the<00:01:10.350> backing<00:01:10.560> track<00:01:10.799> at<00:01:11.280> the

00:01:11.390 --> 00:01:11.400 
play along with the backing track at the

00:01:11.400 --> 00:01:13.280 
play along with the backing track at the
end<00:01:11.430> of<00:01:11.610> this<00:01:11.670> tutorial<00:01:11.930> so<00:01:12.930> here's<00:01:13.140> how<00:01:13.229> the

00:01:13.280 --> 00:01:13.290 
end of this tutorial so here's how the

00:01:13.290 --> 00:01:23.660 
end of this tutorial so here's how the
lick<00:01:13.560> sounds

00:01:23.660 --> 00:01:23.670 

00:01:23.670 --> 00:01:27.230 

so<00:01:24.560> we're<00:01:25.560> going<00:01:25.740> around<00:01:26.010> to<00:01:26.280> major<00:01:26.700> triads

00:01:27.230 --> 00:01:27.240 
so we're going around to major triads

00:01:27.240 --> 00:01:29.870 
so we're going around to major triads
that's<00:01:27.870> an<00:01:27.990> eight<00:01:28.140> riot<00:01:28.500> and<00:01:29.370> that's<00:01:29.580> an<00:01:29.729> eight

00:01:29.870 --> 00:01:29.880 
that's an eight riot and that's an eight

00:01:29.880 --> 00:01:31.700 
that's an eight riot and that's an eight
triad<00:01:30.360> they're<00:01:30.630> just<00:01:30.750> at<00:01:30.900> different<00:01:31.080> spots<00:01:31.470> in

00:01:31.700 --> 00:01:31.710 
triad they're just at different spots in

00:01:31.710 --> 00:01:32.899 
triad they're just at different spots in
the<00:01:31.770> neck

00:01:32.899 --> 00:01:32.909 
the neck

00:01:32.909 --> 00:01:35.420 
the neck
so<00:01:33.509> you<00:01:33.570> can<00:01:33.719> see<00:01:33.869> this<00:01:34.020> first<00:01:34.320> piece<00:01:35.159> of<00:01:35.310> this

00:01:35.420 --> 00:01:35.430 
so you can see this first piece of this

00:01:35.430 --> 00:01:39.319 
so you can see this first piece of this
lick<00:01:36.590> just<00:01:37.590> outlining<00:01:38.009> that<00:01:38.310> first<00:01:38.610> a<00:01:38.850> triad

00:01:39.319 --> 00:01:39.329 
lick just outlining that first a triad

00:01:39.329 --> 00:01:42.889 
lick just outlining that first a triad
and<00:01:39.570> then<00:01:40.560> we<00:01:40.890> move<00:01:41.100> up<00:01:41.539> and<00:01:42.539> now<00:01:42.720> we're

00:01:42.889 --> 00:01:42.899 
and then we move up and now we're

00:01:42.899 --> 00:01:45.319 
and then we move up and now we're
outlining<00:01:43.259> the<00:01:43.470> second<00:01:43.860> a<00:01:43.920> triad<00:01:44.210> but<00:01:45.210> they're

00:01:45.319 --> 00:01:45.329 
outlining the second a triad but they're

00:01:45.329 --> 00:01:47.660 
outlining the second a triad but they're
both<00:01:45.479> a<00:01:45.750> triads<00:01:46.229> that's<00:01:46.890> why<00:01:47.100> it<00:01:47.159> sounds<00:01:47.520> cool

00:01:47.660 --> 00:01:47.670 
both a triads that's why it sounds cool

00:01:47.670 --> 00:01:49.010 
both a triads that's why it sounds cool
and<00:01:47.820> that's<00:01:47.880> why<00:01:48.060> so<00:01:48.299> let's<00:01:48.450> count<00:01:48.659> that<00:01:48.840> out

00:01:49.010 --> 00:01:49.020 
and that's why so let's count that out

00:01:49.020 --> 00:01:51.319 
and that's why so let's count that out
nice<00:01:49.289> and<00:01:49.470> slowly<00:01:49.740> and<00:01:49.920> fluidly<00:01:50.640> here's<00:01:51.210> how

00:01:51.319 --> 00:01:51.329 
nice and slowly and fluidly here's how

00:01:51.329 --> 00:02:06.030 
nice and slowly and fluidly here's how
it<00:01:51.450> looks

00:02:06.030 --> 00:02:06.040 

00:02:06.040 --> 00:02:08.190 

so<00:02:06.700> if<00:02:06.760> we<00:02:06.880> got<00:02:07.120> a<00:02:07.150> beam<00:02:07.360> behind<00:02:07.570> us<00:02:07.870> look<00:02:07.990> back

00:02:08.190 --> 00:02:08.200 
so if we got a beam behind us look back

00:02:08.200 --> 00:02:10.500 
so if we got a beam behind us look back
to<00:02:08.350> try<00:02:08.590> a<00:02:08.619> bit<00:02:08.979> today<00:02:09.160> let's<00:02:09.850> try<00:02:10.150> it<00:02:10.210> that<00:02:10.300> to

00:02:10.500 --> 00:02:10.510 
to try a bit today let's try it that to

00:02:10.510 --> 00:02:14.190 
to try a bit today let's try it that to
me<00:02:10.690> if<00:02:10.900> we<00:02:11.020> move<00:02:11.170> each<00:02:11.470> of<00:02:11.650> those<00:02:11.740> up<00:02:13.200> instead

00:02:14.190 --> 00:02:14.200 
me if we move each of those up instead

00:02:14.200 --> 00:02:15.600 
me if we move each of those up instead
of<00:02:14.290> starting<00:02:14.470> on<00:02:14.650> fret<00:02:14.830> 5<00:02:14.860> we're<00:02:15.250> gonna<00:02:15.340> start

00:02:15.600 --> 00:02:15.610 
of starting on fret 5 we're gonna start

00:02:15.610 --> 00:02:17.670 
of starting on fret 5 we're gonna start
on<00:02:15.700> fret<00:02:15.940> 10<00:02:16.180> now<00:02:16.750> we're<00:02:16.900> gonna<00:02:16.990> be<00:02:17.140> playing<00:02:17.260> D

00:02:17.670 --> 00:02:17.680 
on fret 10 now we're gonna be playing D

00:02:17.680 --> 00:02:20.030 
on fret 10 now we're gonna be playing D
triads<00:02:18.280> so<00:02:18.520> that's<00:02:18.790> a<00:02:18.880> Detroiter

00:02:20.030 --> 00:02:20.040

00:02:20.040 --> 00:02:24.030 
triads so that's a Detroiter
and<00:02:21.040> that's<00:02:21.220> a<00:02:21.340> d<00:02:21.460> triad<00:02:22.650> so<00:02:23.650> now<00:02:23.770> we're<00:02:23.920> gonna

00:02:24.030 --> 00:02:24.040

00:02:24.040 --> 00:02:25.440 
and that's a d triad so now we're gonna
send<00:02:24.280> with<00:02:24.430> a<00:02:24.490> liquor<00:02:24.700> around<00:02:24.940> that<00:02:25.120> but<00:02:25.300> the

00:02:25.440 --> 00:02:25.450 
send with a liquor around that but the

00:02:25.450 --> 00:02:27.060 
send with a liquor around that but the
licks<00:02:25.660> exactly<00:02:26.350> the<00:02:26.470> same<00:02:26.710> so<00:02:26.890> we're<00:02:26.980> gonna

00:02:27.060 --> 00:02:27.070 
licks exactly the same so we're gonna

00:02:27.070 --> 00:02:37.720 
licks exactly the same so we're gonna
start<00:02:27.340> on<00:02:27.460> the<00:02:27.580> 10th<00:02:27.880> fret<00:02:28.120> of<00:02:28.300> the<00:02:28.330> g<00:02:28.540> string

00:02:37.720 --> 00:02:37.730 

00:02:37.730 --> 00:02:39.670 

then<00:02:38.450> we're<00:02:38.599> gonna<00:02:38.720> go<00:02:38.870> back<00:02:38.900> to<00:02:39.080> the<00:02:39.290> a<00:02:39.319> and

00:02:39.670 --> 00:02:39.680 
then we're gonna go back to the a and

00:02:39.680 --> 00:02:49.869 
then we're gonna go back to the a and
play<00:02:39.800> that<00:02:39.980> one<00:02:40.129> more<00:02:40.280> time<00:02:48.310> now<00:02:49.310> just<00:02:49.340> like<00:02:49.760> we

00:02:49.869 --> 00:02:49.879 
play that one more time now just like we

00:02:49.879 --> 00:02:51.729 
play that one more time now just like we
move<00:02:50.060> this<00:02:50.269> to<00:02:50.420> a<00:02:50.450> D<00:02:50.659> shape<00:02:50.930> we're<00:02:51.200> next<00:02:51.530> gonna

00:02:51.729 --> 00:02:51.739 
move this to a D shape we're next gonna

00:02:51.739 --> 00:02:53.500 
move this to a D shape we're next gonna
move<00:02:51.980> it<00:02:52.099> to<00:02:52.129> an<00:02:52.340> e<00:02:52.519> shape<00:02:52.760> because<00:02:53.030> an<00:02:53.150> E<00:02:53.330> is

00:02:53.500 --> 00:02:53.510 
move it to an e shape because an E is

00:02:53.510 --> 00:02:55.630 
move it to an e shape because an E is
the<00:02:53.810> five<00:02:54.019> chord<00:02:54.379> in<00:02:54.530> an<00:02:54.709> a<00:02:54.830> blues<00:02:55.099> progression

00:02:55.630 --> 00:02:55.640 
the five chord in an a blues progression

00:02:55.640 --> 00:02:59.770 
the five chord in an a blues progression
so<00:02:56.360> if<00:02:56.750> this<00:02:56.989> is<00:02:57.170> an<00:02:57.260> a<00:02:57.379> triad<00:02:58.239> this<00:02:59.239> is<00:02:59.450> an<00:02:59.569> e

00:02:59.770 --> 00:02:59.780 
so if this is an a triad this is an e

00:02:59.780 --> 00:03:01.570 
so if this is an a triad this is an e
triad<00:03:00.230> we're<00:03:00.739> gonna<00:03:00.830> start<00:03:01.129> on<00:03:01.220> the<00:03:01.310> twelfth

00:03:01.570 --> 00:03:01.580 
triad we're gonna start on the twelfth

00:03:01.580 --> 00:03:01.990 
triad we're gonna start on the twelfth
fret

00:03:01.990 --> 00:03:02.000 
fret

00:03:02.000 --> 00:04:13.120 
fret
start<00:03:02.750> with<00:03:02.870> the<00:03:02.959> a<00:03:03.730> one<00:03:04.730> two<00:03:05.120> three<00:03:05.629> go

00:04:13.120 --> 00:04:13.130 

00:04:13.130 --> 00:04:15.190
