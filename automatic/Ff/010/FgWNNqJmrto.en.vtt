I love 15 so it's always good to go into

00:00:38.940 --> 00:00:41.510 
I love 15 so it's always good to go into
your<00:00:39.059> options<00:00:39.300> and<00:00:40.050> setting<00:00:40.739> your<00:00:40.980> difficulty

00:00:41.510 --> 00:00:41.520 
your options and setting your difficulty

00:00:41.520 --> 00:00:44.540 
your options and setting your difficulty
your<00:00:41.879> battle<00:00:42.239> difficulty<00:00:42.629> too<00:00:43.250> easy

00:00:44.540 --> 00:00:44.550 
your battle difficulty too easy

00:00:44.550 --> 00:00:46.310 
your battle difficulty too easy
it's<00:00:45.360> the<00:00:45.420> best<00:00:45.570> thing<00:00:45.719> normals<00:00:46.110> gonna<00:00:46.260> be

00:00:46.310 --> 00:00:46.320 
it's the best thing normals gonna be

00:00:46.320 --> 00:00:49.700 
it's the best thing normals gonna be
quite<00:00:46.530> difficult<00:00:46.610> if<00:00:47.610> you're<00:00:47.969> under<00:00:48.420> level<00:00:48.870> 25

00:00:49.700 --> 00:00:49.710 
quite difficult if you're under level 25

00:00:49.710 --> 00:00:53.450 
quite difficult if you're under level 25
ish<00:00:51.379> so<00:00:52.379> this<00:00:52.649> is<00:00:52.739> we<00:00:52.829> just<00:00:52.860> have<00:00:53.070> a<00:00:53.160> little<00:00:53.370> bit

00:00:53.450 --> 00:00:53.460 
ish so this is we just have a little bit

00:00:53.460 --> 00:00:55.389 
ish so this is we just have a little bit
because<00:00:53.579> the<00:00:53.699> battles<00:00:53.969> can<00:00:54.149> get<00:00:54.329> a<00:00:54.539> bit<00:00:54.840> long

00:00:55.389 --> 00:00:55.399 
because the battles can get a bit long

00:00:55.399 --> 00:00:59.479 
because the battles can get a bit long
generally<00:00:56.399> around<00:00:57.050> 15<00:00:58.050> to<00:00:58.350> 25<00:00:58.890> you<00:00:59.160> want<00:00:59.340> to<00:00:59.430> be

00:00:59.479 --> 00:00:59.489 
generally around 15 to 25 you want to be

00:00:59.489 --> 00:01:01.849 
generally around 15 to 25 you want to be
sneaking<00:00:59.850> behind<00:01:00.120> these<00:01:00.539> monsters<00:01:01.020> and<00:01:01.289> many

00:01:01.849 --> 00:01:01.859 
sneaking behind these monsters and many

00:01:01.859 --> 00:01:03.920 
sneaking behind these monsters and many
because<00:01:02.190> it<00:01:02.460> does<00:01:02.640> the<00:01:02.850> initial<00:01:03.239> damage<00:01:03.390> and

00:01:03.920 --> 00:01:03.930 
because it does the initial damage and

00:01:03.930 --> 00:01:06.530 
because it does the initial damage and
it<00:01:04.379> saves<00:01:04.619> you<00:01:04.710> a<00:01:04.769> lot<00:01:04.890> of<00:01:04.949> time<00:01:05.309> overall<00:01:06.270> but

00:01:06.530 --> 00:01:06.540 
it saves you a lot of time overall but

00:01:06.540 --> 00:01:08.600 
it saves you a lot of time overall but
once<00:01:06.689> you<00:01:06.810> hit<00:01:06.960> level<00:01:07.020> 30s<00:01:07.950> you<00:01:08.100> can<00:01:08.280> just<00:01:08.460> run

00:01:08.600 --> 00:01:08.610 
once you hit level 30s you can just run

00:01:08.610 --> 00:01:11.870 
once you hit level 30s you can just run
straight<00:01:08.729> into<00:01:08.939> them<00:01:10.010> always<00:01:11.010> make<00:01:11.310> sure<00:01:11.340> you

00:01:11.870 --> 00:01:11.880 
straight into them always make sure you

00:01:11.880 --> 00:01:13.640 
straight into them always make sure you
are<00:01:11.909> eating<00:01:12.360> items<00:01:12.930> as<00:01:13.170> well<00:01:13.320> when<00:01:13.560> you're

00:01:13.640 --> 00:01:13.650

haven't got them you should look into

00:01:20.729 --> 00:01:23.179 
haven't got them you should look into
investing<00:01:21.659> some<00:01:21.810> money<00:01:22.049> into<00:01:22.259> that<00:01:22.470> store<00:01:22.890> a

00:01:23.179 --> 00:01:23.189 
investing some money into that store a

00:01:23.189 --> 00:01:24.740 
investing some money into that store a
lot<00:01:23.939> of<00:01:23.970> people<00:01:24.180> kind<00:01:24.330> of<00:01:24.390> waste<00:01:24.570> their<00:01:24.720> money

straight into weapon and armor stuff and

00:01:26.880 --> 00:01:28.819 
straight into weapon and armor stuff and
that<00:01:27.720> stuff<00:01:27.780> gets<00:01:28.080> really<00:01:28.229> expensive<00:01:28.530> very

that stuff gets really expensive very

00:01:28.829 --> 00:01:31.130 
that stuff gets really expensive very
quick<00:01:29.040> so<00:01:29.250> it's<00:01:29.400> always<00:01:29.520> worth<00:01:29.780> going<00:01:30.780> and
