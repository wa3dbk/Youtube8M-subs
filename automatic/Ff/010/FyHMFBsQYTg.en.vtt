00:00:22.880 --> 00:00:33.570
 while the oil is heated in the pan 

00:00:25.769 --> 00:00:35.059

00:00:42.030 --> 00:00:47.570
 possible or how you want to cut it 

00:01:03.030 --> 00:01:09.690

00:01:06.670 --> 00:01:09.690

00:01:25.960 --> 00:01:33.250
 while the meat is being seared 

00:01:29.049 --> 00:01:33.250
 the onions are diced 

00:01:51.050 --> 00:01:56.000
 if it is well fried, it will be us 

00:01:54.440 --> 00:02:05.780
 taken out of the pliers again 

00:01:56.000 --> 00:02:15.350

00:02:05.780 --> 00:02:18.430
 the diced belly bacon and the 

00:02:15.350 --> 00:02:18.430
 onion in the pan 

00:02:21.490 --> 00:02:26.190
 they are fried just as short 

00:02:32.640 --> 00:02:38.130
 then comes the same length if she is fine 

00:02:34.800 --> 00:02:41.310

00:02:38.130 --> 00:02:43.620

00:03:34.030 --> 00:03:38.620
