00:02:52.310 --> 00:02:52.320 
I have them it's it's it's cool but it's

00:02:52.320 --> 00:02:54.800 
I have them it's it's it's cool but it's
it's<00:02:52.650> one<00:02:52.950> of<00:02:53.010> those<00:02:53.070> all-in-one<00:02:53.670> pedals<00:02:54.090> for

00:02:54.800 --> 00:02:54.810
