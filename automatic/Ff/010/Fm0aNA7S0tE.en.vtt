sort of add some extra moisture and I

00:01:57.800 --> 00:01:57.810 
actually have oily skin so I tend to

00:01:57.810 --> 00:01:59.179 
actually have oily skin so I tend to
stay<00:01:58.020> away<00:01:58.049> from<00:01:58.290> products<00:01:58.799> that<00:01:58.860> actually

want to add extra moisture to your face

00:02:01.229 --> 00:02:03.289 
want to add extra moisture to your face

00:02:03.289 --> 00:02:03.299

for<00:03:26.490> you<00:03:26.670> on<00:03:26.880> top<00:03:27.120> of<00:03:27.180> the<00:03:27.450> liquid<00:03:27.810> foundation

00:04:00.509 --> 00:04:00.519 

00:04:00.519 --> 00:04:02.920 

replied<00:04:01.519> the<00:04:01.670> purpose<00:04:01.970> of<00:04:02.090> my<00:04:02.180> whole<00:04:02.390> face<00:04:02.629> and

00:04:02.920 --> 00:04:02.930 
replied the purpose of my whole face and

00:04:02.930 --> 00:04:04.420 
replied the purpose of my whole face and
you<00:04:02.989> can<00:04:03.170> see<00:04:03.379> there<00:04:03.590> hasn't<00:04:03.769> been<00:04:03.920> too<00:04:04.250> much

00:04:04.420 --> 00:04:04.430 
you can see there hasn't been too much

00:04:04.430 --> 00:04:07.300 
you can see there hasn't been too much
of<00:04:04.670> a<00:04:04.790> dramatic<00:04:05.360> difference<00:04:05.780> but<00:04:06.739> it<00:04:06.860> just<00:04:07.040> has

00:04:07.300 --> 00:04:07.310 
of a dramatic difference but it just has

00:04:07.310 --> 00:04:09.399 
of a dramatic difference but it just has
slightly<00:04:08.000> mattified<00:04:08.870> it<00:04:09.019> and<00:04:09.170> that's<00:04:09.290> because

00:04:09.399 --> 00:04:09.409 
slightly mattified it and that's because

00:04:09.409 --> 00:04:11.740 
slightly mattified it and that's because
I've<00:04:09.680> used<00:04:09.890> a<00:04:10.010> rather<00:04:10.220> loose<00:04:10.610> powder<00:04:11.060> brush<00:04:11.450> I

00:04:11.740 --> 00:04:11.750 
I've used a rather loose powder brush I

00:04:11.750 --> 00:04:13.660 
I've used a rather loose powder brush I
don't<00:04:12.079> really<00:04:12.260> like<00:04:12.530> to<00:04:12.769> apply<00:04:13.159> my<00:04:13.189> powder

00:04:13.660 --> 00:04:13.670 
don't really like to apply my powder

00:04:13.670 --> 00:04:15.999 
don't really like to apply my powder
density<00:04:14.450> because<00:04:14.720> I<00:04:14.840> find<00:04:15.170> it<00:04:15.379> just<00:04:15.560> looks<00:04:15.859> a

00:04:15.999 --> 00:04:16.009 
density because I find it just looks a

00:04:16.009 --> 00:04:18.249 
density because I find it just looks a
bit<00:04:16.039> too<00:04:16.400> cakey<00:04:16.669> as<00:04:17.030> I<00:04:17.150> said<00:04:17.359> before<00:04:17.509> so<00:04:18.049> back

00:04:18.249 --> 00:04:18.259 
bit too cakey as I said before so back

00:04:18.259 --> 00:04:20.800 
bit too cakey as I said before so back
to<00:04:18.289> the<00:04:18.500> liquid<00:04:18.859> foundation<00:04:19.669> I<00:04:20.000> have<00:04:20.299> found

00:04:20.800 --> 00:04:20.810 
to the liquid foundation I have found

00:04:20.810 --> 00:04:22.960 
to the liquid foundation I have found
this<00:04:20.930> rather<00:04:21.139> easy<00:04:21.560> to<00:04:21.859> work<00:04:22.039> with<00:04:22.100> I<00:04:22.610> think

00:04:22.960 --> 00:04:22.970 
this rather easy to work with I think

00:04:22.970 --> 00:04:24.790 
this rather easy to work with I think
four<00:04:23.360> six<00:04:23.600> pound<00:04:23.870> lighter<00:04:24.080> you're<00:04:24.410> getting<00:04:24.710> a

00:04:27.199 --> 00:04:29.650 
very good quality product I actually
haven't<00:04:27.710> had<00:04:28.070> any<00:04:28.340> problems<00:04:28.970> with<00:04:29.180> this<00:04:29.419> you

00:04:29.650 --> 00:04:29.660 
haven't had any problems with this you

00:04:32.080 --> 00:04:32.090 
know not lasting me all day I use it for

00:04:32.090 --> 00:04:34.750 
know not lasting me all day I use it for
very<00:04:32.330> bog-standard<00:04:32.650> going<00:04:33.650> to<00:04:33.860> work<00:04:34.190> everyday

00:04:34.750 --> 00:04:34.760 
very bog-standard going to work everyday

00:04:34.760 --> 00:04:37.029 
very bog-standard going to work everyday
use<00:04:35.270> and<00:04:35.690> I<00:04:35.840> find<00:04:36.139> that<00:04:36.260> it<00:04:36.380> lasts<00:04:36.620> me<00:04:36.830> all<00:04:36.889> day

00:04:37.029 --> 00:04:37.039 
use and I find that it lasts me all day

00:04:37.039 --> 00:04:39.010 
use and I find that it lasts me all day
I<00:04:37.070> haven't<00:04:37.430> had<00:04:37.669> to<00:04:37.850> touch<00:04:38.090> it<00:04:38.240> up<00:04:38.330> at<00:04:38.539> all<00:04:38.750> and

00:04:39.010 --> 00:04:39.020 
I haven't had to touch it up at all and

00:04:39.020 --> 00:04:41.110 
I haven't had to touch it up at all and
I<00:04:39.110> haven't<00:04:39.470> found<00:04:39.680> my<00:04:39.919> skin<00:04:40.190> looking<00:04:40.520> too<00:04:40.699> oily

00:04:41.110 --> 00:04:41.120 
I haven't found my skin looking too oily

00:04:41.120 --> 00:04:42.820 
I haven't found my skin looking too oily
and<00:04:41.210> that's<00:04:41.419> even<00:04:41.810> without<00:04:42.020> using<00:04:42.560> a<00:04:42.620> powder

00:04:42.820 --> 00:04:42.830 
and that's even without using a powder

00:04:42.830 --> 00:04:44.620 
and that's even without using a powder
I've<00:04:43.190> tried<00:04:43.550> it<00:04:43.699> with<00:04:43.970> and<00:04:44.210> without<00:04:44.300> the

00:04:44.620 --> 00:04:44.630 
I've tried it with and without the

00:04:44.630 --> 00:04:46.540 
I've tried it with and without the
powder<00:04:44.840> and<00:04:45.260> I<00:04:45.500> found<00:04:45.770> that<00:04:45.830> actually<00:04:46.160> can<00:04:46.370> get

00:04:46.540 --> 00:04:46.550 
powder and I found that actually can get

00:04:46.550 --> 00:04:48.040 
powder and I found that actually can get
away<00:04:46.760> with<00:04:46.940> not<00:04:47.090> wearing<00:04:47.240> a<00:04:47.449> powder<00:04:47.660> with<00:04:47.930> this

00:04:48.040 --> 00:04:48.050 
away with not wearing a powder with this

00:04:48.050 --> 00:04:49.719 
away with not wearing a powder with this
foundation<00:04:48.710> I<00:04:48.889> think<00:04:49.220> that's<00:04:49.370> because<00:04:49.550> I

00:04:49.719 --> 00:04:49.729 
foundation I think that's because I

00:04:49.729 --> 00:04:51.670 
foundation I think that's because I
haven't<00:04:50.389> been<00:04:50.570> wearing<00:04:50.990> it<00:04:51.169> too<00:04:51.349> you<00:04:51.500> know

00:04:51.670 --> 00:04:51.680 
haven't been wearing it too you know

00:04:51.680 --> 00:04:55.150 
haven't been wearing it too you know
really<00:04:52.669> sweaty<00:04:53.060> humid<00:04:53.599> places<00:04:54.110> and<00:04:54.470> also<00:04:55.039> it

00:04:55.150 --> 00:04:55.160 
really sweaty humid places and also it

00:04:55.160 --> 00:04:57.520 
really sweaty humid places and also it
is<00:04:55.190> winter<00:04:55.759> so<00:04:55.970> my<00:04:56.150> skin<00:04:56.570> obviously<00:04:56.930> isn't

00:04:57.520 --> 00:04:57.530 
is winter so my skin obviously isn't

00:04:57.530 --> 00:05:00.100 
is winter so my skin obviously isn't
producing<00:04:58.220> as<00:04:58.400> much<00:04:58.639> oil<00:04:58.970> it's<00:04:59.300> rather<00:04:59.539> dry<00:04:59.960> at

00:05:00.100 --> 00:05:00.110 
producing as much oil it's rather dry at

00:05:00.110 --> 00:05:02.110 
producing as much oil it's rather dry at
the<00:05:00.260> moment<00:05:00.680> I'm<00:05:00.889> finding<00:05:01.610> that<00:05:01.699> I<00:05:01.760> need<00:05:02.000> to

00:05:02.110 --> 00:05:02.120 
the moment I'm finding that I need to

00:05:02.120 --> 00:05:03.939 
the moment I'm finding that I need to
apply<00:05:02.240> more<00:05:02.419> coconut<00:05:03.050> oil<00:05:03.199> at<00:05:03.320> night<00:05:03.530> before<00:05:03.770> I

00:05:03.939 --> 00:05:03.949 
apply more coconut oil at night before I

00:05:03.949 --> 00:05:05.800 
apply more coconut oil at night before I
go<00:05:04.099> to<00:05:04.130> bed<00:05:04.460> so<00:05:04.669> I<00:05:04.940> think<00:05:05.210> that's<00:05:05.360> the<00:05:05.479> reason

00:05:05.800 --> 00:05:05.810 
go to bed so I think that's the reason

00:05:05.810 --> 00:05:07.659 
go to bed so I think that's the reason
why<00:05:05.930> I've<00:05:06.139> been<00:05:06.380> able<00:05:06.500> to<00:05:06.650> get<00:05:07.039> away<00:05:07.250> with

00:05:07.659 --> 00:05:07.669 
why I've been able to get away with

00:05:07.669 --> 00:05:09.070 
why I've been able to get away with
wearing<00:05:07.910> this<00:05:08.270> foundation

00:05:09.070 --> 00:05:09.080 
wearing this foundation

00:05:09.080 --> 00:05:11.050 
wearing this foundation
there's<00:05:09.410> a<00:05:09.500> lovely<00:05:09.740> youtuber<00:05:10.460> called<00:05:10.699> dark

00:05:11.050 --> 00:05:11.060 
there's a lovely youtuber called dark

00:05:11.060 --> 00:05:12.219 
there's a lovely youtuber called dark

00:05:12.219 --> 00:05:12.229 
chocolate creature

00:05:12.229 --> 00:05:13.510 
chocolate creature
I<00:05:12.380> think<00:05:12.590> her<00:05:12.680> channel<00:05:13.010> is<00:05:13.130> I'll<00:05:13.280> link<00:05:13.460> her

00:05:13.510 --> 00:05:13.520 
I think her channel is I'll link her

00:05:13.520 --> 00:05:15.370 
I think her channel is I'll link her
channel<00:05:13.610> down<00:05:13.940> below<00:05:14.060> and<00:05:14.419> I<00:05:14.510> know<00:05:14.570> she<00:05:14.750> uses

00:05:15.370 --> 00:05:15.380 
channel down below and I know she uses

00:05:15.380 --> 00:05:17.770 
channel down below and I know she uses
Kiko<00:05:15.770> cosmetics<00:05:15.979> too<00:05:16.729> and<00:05:17.150> I<00:05:17.210> think<00:05:17.270> that<00:05:17.599> she

00:05:17.770 --> 00:05:17.780 
Kiko cosmetics too and I think that she

00:05:17.780 --> 00:05:19.510 
Kiko cosmetics too and I think that she
recently<00:05:18.260> did<00:05:18.440> a<00:05:18.470> foundation<00:05:19.039> review<00:05:19.159> so<00:05:19.490> you

00:05:19.510 --> 00:05:19.520 
recently did a foundation review so you

00:05:19.520 --> 00:05:20.980 
recently did a foundation review so you
may<00:05:19.789> want<00:05:20.000> to<00:05:20.030> go<00:05:20.180> and<00:05:20.300> check<00:05:20.510> hers

00:05:20.980 --> 00:05:20.990 
may want to go and check hers

00:05:20.990 --> 00:05:22.300 
may want to go and check hers
just<00:05:21.199> so<00:05:21.289> you<00:05:21.380> have<00:05:21.530> an<00:05:21.650> alternative

00:05:22.300 --> 00:05:22.310 
just so you have an alternative

00:05:22.310 --> 00:05:24.279 
just so you have an alternative
viewpoint<00:05:22.610> I<00:05:23.150> think<00:05:23.419> that<00:05:23.539> this<00:05:23.659> foundation

00:05:24.279 --> 00:05:24.289 
viewpoint I think that this foundation

00:05:24.289 --> 00:05:26.350 
viewpoint I think that this foundation
blends<00:05:24.560> fairly<00:05:25.070> easily<00:05:25.340> I<00:05:25.669> don't<00:05:26.060> have<00:05:26.240> to

00:05:26.350 --> 00:05:26.360 
blends fairly easily I don't have to

00:05:26.360 --> 00:05:28.750 
blends fairly easily I don't have to
work<00:05:26.630> too<00:05:26.930> hard<00:05:26.960> to<00:05:27.409> get<00:05:27.620> it<00:05:27.710> onto<00:05:27.889> my<00:05:28.220> skin<00:05:28.550> it

00:05:28.750 --> 00:05:28.760 
work too hard to get it onto my skin it

00:05:28.760 --> 00:05:30.640 
work too hard to get it onto my skin it
doesn't<00:05:28.909> just<00:05:29.180> slip<00:05:29.630> on<00:05:29.870> this<00:05:30.020> naturally<00:05:30.560> as

00:05:30.640 --> 00:05:30.650 
doesn't just slip on this naturally as

00:05:30.650 --> 00:05:33.430 
doesn't just slip on this naturally as
my<00:05:30.860> Lancome<00:05:31.340> foundations<00:05:32.030> but<00:05:32.659> I<00:05:32.720> think<00:05:33.199> that

00:05:33.430 --> 00:05:33.440 
my Lancome foundations but I think that

00:05:33.440 --> 00:05:35.800 
my Lancome foundations but I think that
again<00:05:33.740> for<00:05:34.039> 6-pound<00:05:34.430> my<00:05:34.580> ticket<00:05:35.000> function<00:05:35.659> is

00:05:35.800 --> 00:05:35.810 
again for 6-pound my ticket function is

00:05:35.810 --> 00:05:37.719 
again for 6-pound my ticket function is
really<00:05:36.229> really<00:05:36.560> well<00:05:36.740> I<00:05:36.949> think<00:05:37.250> that<00:05:37.400> it<00:05:37.490> could

00:05:37.719 --> 00:05:37.729 
really really well I think that it could

00:05:37.729 --> 00:05:40.000 
really really well I think that it could
match<00:05:38.060> my<00:05:38.330> skin<00:05:38.630> tone<00:05:38.659> a<00:05:39.110> little<00:05:39.139> bit<00:05:39.620> better

00:05:40.000 --> 00:05:40.010 
match my skin tone a little bit better

00:05:40.010 --> 00:05:41.980 
match my skin tone a little bit better
by<00:05:40.669> thinking<00:05:41.000> that<00:05:41.120> because<00:05:41.240> it's<00:05:41.479> winter<00:05:41.750> and

00:05:41.980 --> 00:05:41.990 
by thinking that because it's winter and

00:05:41.990 --> 00:05:43.570 
by thinking that because it's winter and
again<00:05:42.320> I'm<00:05:42.409> not<00:05:42.560> as<00:05:42.650> dark<00:05:42.919> as<00:05:43.099> I<00:05:43.190> would<00:05:43.370> be<00:05:43.490> in

00:05:43.570 --> 00:05:43.580 
again I'm not as dark as I would be in

00:05:43.580 --> 00:05:45.640 
again I'm not as dark as I would be in
the<00:05:43.729> summer<00:05:44.030> I<00:05:44.330> managed<00:05:44.780> to<00:05:44.930> get<00:05:45.050> away<00:05:45.199> with<00:05:45.470> it

00:05:45.640 --> 00:05:45.650 
the summer I managed to get away with it

00:05:45.650 --> 00:05:47.439 
the summer I managed to get away with it
but<00:05:45.800> in<00:05:45.919> the<00:05:46.070> summer<00:05:46.310> as<00:05:46.550> my<00:05:46.729> skin<00:05:46.970> gets<00:05:47.150> darker

00:05:47.439 --> 00:05:47.449 
but in the summer as my skin gets darker

00:05:47.449 --> 00:05:49.420 
but in the summer as my skin gets darker
I<00:05:47.960> don't<00:05:48.470> think<00:05:48.650> I'll<00:05:48.770> be<00:05:48.800> able<00:05:48.919> to<00:05:49.070> wear<00:05:49.310> this

00:05:49.420 --> 00:05:49.430 
I don't think I'll be able to wear this

00:05:49.430 --> 00:05:51.339 
I don't think I'll be able to wear this
foundation<00:05:49.639> I<00:05:50.330> really<00:05:50.630> like<00:05:50.810> the<00:05:50.990> fact<00:05:51.199> that

00:05:51.339 --> 00:05:51.349 
foundation I really like the fact that

00:05:51.349 --> 00:05:52.960 
foundation I really like the fact that
it's<00:05:51.590> in<00:05:51.710> the<00:05:51.740> lightweight<00:05:51.949> packaging<00:05:52.789> I

00:05:52.960 --> 00:05:52.970 
it's in the lightweight packaging I

00:05:52.970 --> 00:05:54.820 
it's in the lightweight packaging I
don't<00:05:53.270> feel<00:05:53.510> like<00:05:53.690> it's<00:05:53.840> too<00:05:54.020> bulky<00:05:54.289> when<00:05:54.650> I'm

00:05:54.820 --> 00:05:54.830 
don't feel like it's too bulky when I'm

00:05:54.830 --> 00:05:57.250 
don't feel like it's too bulky when I'm
hanging<00:05:55.190> around<00:05:55.580> in<00:05:55.760> my<00:05:55.880> handbag<00:05:56.360> unlike<00:05:57.080> the

00:05:57.250 --> 00:05:57.260 
hanging around in my handbag unlike the

00:05:57.260 --> 00:05:59.409 
hanging around in my handbag unlike the
Lancome<00:05:57.650> foundation<00:05:58.220> which<00:05:58.400> is<00:05:58.580> very<00:05:59.030> bulky

00:05:59.409 --> 00:05:59.419 
Lancome foundation which is very bulky

00:05:59.419 --> 00:06:01.659 
Lancome foundation which is very bulky

00:06:01.659 --> 00:06:01.669 
it's on a glass bottle so this can be

00:06:01.669 --> 00:06:02.650 
it's on a glass bottle so this can be
quite<00:06:01.820> heavy<00:06:02.120> to<00:06:02.360> carry

00:06:02.650 --> 00:06:02.660 
quite heavy to carry

00:06:02.660 --> 00:06:05.140 
quite heavy to carry

00:06:14.140 --> 00:06:14.150 
not going to lose any product although

00:06:14.150 --> 00:06:15.790 
not going to lose any product although
it<00:06:14.630> won't<00:06:14.840> really<00:06:14.960> matter<00:06:15.080> in<00:06:15.380> it<00:06:15.530> because<00:06:15.680> it

00:06:15.790 --> 00:06:15.800 
it won't really matter in it because it

00:06:15.800 --> 00:06:18.460 
it won't really matter in it because it
was<00:06:15.890> only<00:06:16.010> seven<00:06:16.430> pounds<00:06:16.820> the<00:06:17.450> tube<00:06:17.750> opens<00:06:18.260> up

00:06:18.460 --> 00:06:18.470 
was only seven pounds the tube opens up

00:06:18.470 --> 00:06:20.860 
was only seven pounds the tube opens up
like<00:06:18.710> so<00:06:19.070> and<00:06:19.730> you<00:06:19.940> literally<00:06:20.180> just<00:06:20.330> squeeze

00:06:20.860 --> 00:06:20.870 
like so and you literally just squeeze

00:06:20.870 --> 00:06:23.830 
like so and you literally just squeeze
it<00:06:21.110> out<00:06:21.260> and<00:06:22.190> I<00:06:22.310> squeeze<00:06:22.640> the<00:06:23.090> foundation<00:06:23.630> onto

00:06:23.830 --> 00:06:23.840

00:06:23.840 --> 00:06:26.350 
it out and I squeeze the foundation onto
my<00:06:24.080> hand<00:06:24.320> before<00:06:24.530> I<00:06:24.770> apply<00:06:25.040> it<00:06:25.100> and<00:06:26.000> this<00:06:26.210> is

00:06:29.770 --> 00:06:29.780 
what it looks like and it is lighter

00:06:29.780 --> 00:06:33.580

other and actually what I'll usually do

00:06:43.040 --> 00:06:44.350 
other and actually what I'll usually do
is<00:06:43.160> just<00:06:43.340> take<00:06:43.550> some<00:06:43.730> of<00:06:43.820> the<00:06:43.940> Lancome

00:06:57.430 --> 00:06:57.440 
the actual true nature of the foundation

00:06:57.440 --> 00:06:59.170 
the actual true nature of the foundation
without<00:06:57.560> mixing<00:06:58.250> it<00:06:58.370> with<00:06:58.550> another<00:06:58.940> color

overall I would recommend that you guys
try<00:07:01.520> out<00:07:01.550> this<00:07:01.790> foundation<00:07:02.390> in<00:07:02.930> particular<00:07:03.260> if

00:07:03.520 --> 00:07:03.530 
try out this foundation in particular if

00:07:03.530 --> 00:07:05.500 
try out this foundation in particular if
you<00:07:03.620> have<00:07:03.650> dry<00:07:04.040> skin<00:07:04.460> because<00:07:04.670> as<00:07:05.030> I<00:07:05.150> said<00:07:05.210> this

00:07:05.500 --> 00:07:05.510 
you have dry skin because as I said this

00:07:05.510 --> 00:07:07.720 
you have dry skin because as I said this
is<00:07:05.690> a<00:07:05.720> moisturizing<00:07:06.500> foundation<00:07:07.100> so<00:07:07.610> it

00:07:07.720 --> 00:07:07.730 
is a moisturizing foundation so it

00:07:07.730 --> 00:07:10.000 
is a moisturizing foundation so it
should<00:07:07.970> work<00:07:08.240> for<00:07:08.570> you<00:07:08.630> it<00:07:09.290> hasn't<00:07:09.650> caused<00:07:09.830> me

00:07:10.000 --> 00:07:10.010 
should work for you it hasn't caused me
