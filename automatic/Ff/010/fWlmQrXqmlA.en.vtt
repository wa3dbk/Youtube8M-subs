00:00:08.040 --> 00:00:13.259
 it all seduced us very early 

00:00:10.330 --> 00:00:15.639
 am in the company of rs the people 

00:00:13.259 --> 00:00:18.010
 yeah so today we end up 

00:00:15.639 --> 00:00:19.570
 on bo two names on a gameplay but 

00:00:18.010 --> 00:00:22.240
 rather for a little trick 

00:00:19.570 --> 00:00:23.740
 I guess many more you 

00:00:22.240 --> 00:00:27.880
 a lot of people among them between 

00:00:23.740 --> 00:00:29.320
 of you sorry for it's that he 

00:00:27.880 --> 00:00:33.219
 should have pretty stylish emblems 

00:00:29.320 --> 00:00:35.320
 good but do not necessarily have the time to 

00:00:33.219 --> 00:00:38.199
 dedicate for the emblems I have the 

00:00:35.320 --> 00:00:40.870
 solution then it's a little glitch 

00:00:38.199 --> 00:00:44.800
 it's a kind of glitch but in the 

00:00:40.870 --> 00:00:46.719
 game of sending in the game we could say 

00:00:44.800 --> 00:00:48.520
 like that we play the styles you 

00:00:46.719 --> 00:00:49.960
 explain it then for now no I 

00:00:48.520 --> 00:00:53.230
 you showed more for you too 

00:00:49.960 --> 00:00:55.719
 show ok ben you have to put your 

00:00:53.230 --> 00:01:01.870
 flair his barracks do not click on it 

00:00:55.719 --> 00:01:03.969
 for which are still you do not have 

00:01:01.870 --> 00:01:06.430
 no it's going to put you friends and 

00:01:03.969 --> 00:01:08.380
 cf the keyboard you press f 

00:01:06.430 --> 00:01:09.340
 and as the detail remains I think that 

00:01:08.380 --> 00:01:12.460
 you did not stay too well 

00:01:09.340 --> 00:01:14.740
 you are looking for a little person to whom 

00:01:12.460 --> 00:01:17.920
 you want to take his emblem 

00:01:14.740 --> 00:01:19.570
 I take this gospel so that what 

00:01:17.920 --> 00:01:19.960
 you do it's you click on the 

00:01:19.570 --> 00:01:22.360
 nobody 

00:01:19.960 --> 00:01:23.799
 so I'm doing it successfully because 

00:01:22.360 --> 00:01:25.720
 would also make a youtube channel 

00:01:23.799 --> 00:01:27.220
 so I will put the link in the 

00:01:25.720 --> 00:01:27.820
 description of his chain is his 

00:01:27.220 --> 00:01:30.250
 first video 

00:01:27.820 --> 00:01:31.960
 so little closed parenthesis so there 

00:01:30.250 --> 00:01:33.369
 you go with your curriculum on string 

00:01:31.960 --> 00:01:36.490
 player 

00:01:33.369 --> 00:01:38.710
 and then you have to use a glitch so 

00:01:36.490 --> 00:01:42.420
 very simple slide you're going to have to 

00:01:38.710 --> 00:01:45.189
 do it very quickly without getting it wrong 

00:01:42.420 --> 00:01:46.840
 what am I going to tell you now so 

00:01:45.189 --> 00:01:48.130
 me I the notations and leaves I 

00:01:46.840 --> 00:01:51.050
 you can very well and we were a 

00:01:48.130 --> 00:01:53.570
 leaf so the 

00:01:51.050 --> 00:01:55.610
 the glitch and so you put on his 

00:01:53.570 --> 00:01:56.930
 laurels something that they need 

00:01:55.610 --> 00:01:58.310
 that he not let you assure 

00:01:56.930 --> 00:01:58.700
 player string to let the cursor 

00:01:58.310 --> 00:02:00.920
 above 

00:01:58.700 --> 00:02:03.170
 yes here I am here you are doing 

00:02:00.920 --> 00:02:06.350
 happy holidays I will not tell you where 

00:02:03.170 --> 00:02:08.990
 brings twice the arrow in the 

00:02:06.350 --> 00:02:10.210
 high 3 times fumble twice entered he 

00:02:08.990 --> 00:02:14.060
 must escape a foundry 

00:02:10.210 --> 00:02:16.070
 so I repeat once entered twice 

00:02:14.060 --> 00:02:17.270
 the arrow up so the arrow 

00:02:16.070 --> 00:02:19.880
 directional up 

00:02:17.270 --> 00:02:20.450
 three times escapes twice entered a 

00:02:19.880 --> 00:02:23.900
 times escapes 

00:02:20.450 --> 00:02:26.390
 Once in, we're right 

00:02:23.900 --> 00:02:29.000
 According to show you that is 

00:02:26.390 --> 00:02:31.480
 what will happen once this 

00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:34.880
 little glitch would have been realized so 

00:02:31.480 --> 00:02:36.860
 I think I'm making a small break 

00:02:34.880 --> 00:02:39.020
 it's very simple because it's not 

00:02:36.860 --> 00:02:40.160
 not walk all the time and suddenly 

00:02:39.020 --> 00:02:42.560
 it may take time and instead 

00:02:40.160 --> 00:02:44.450
 to invite you to win the video 

00:02:42.560 --> 00:02:46.820
 the failures I'm going to do I prefer 

00:02:44.450 --> 00:02:48.560
 that we arrive directly on the glitch 

00:02:46.820 --> 00:02:53.270
 so we end up right after 

00:02:48.560 --> 00:02:54.950
 re so then so here's one more time 

00:02:53.270 --> 00:02:56.959
 you will have succeeded the glitch so I will 

00:02:54.950 --> 00:02:59.090
 repeat again here the cleach 

00:02:56.959 --> 00:03:00.770
 not walk the first time it's because 

00:02:59.090 --> 00:03:02.030
 that you have hurt it maybe 

00:03:00.770 --> 00:03:03.890
 that you did well but not the good one 

00:03:02.030 --> 00:03:05.030
 timing or if you have the right timing and 

00:03:03.890 --> 00:03:09.500
 knows that sometimes the cause does not 

00:03:05.030 --> 00:03:12.690
 does not take into account so once 

00:03:09.500 --> 00:03:15.600
 you would have done that there you are going to have 

00:03:12.690 --> 00:03:17.520
 always their emblem when you go 

00:03:15.600 --> 00:03:19.590
 to do if you have already chosen 

00:03:17.520 --> 00:03:21.840
 the emblem that you like most so I 

00:03:19.590 --> 00:03:26.270
 the emblematic plains incessant this 

00:03:21.840 --> 00:03:29.090
 emblem there that I like so you have so 

00:03:26.270 --> 00:03:32.280
 you did it for your video or what 

00:03:29.090 --> 00:03:35.520
 no no i can offer dacquois so 

00:03:32.280 --> 00:03:41.090
 there you click on the emblem so the 

00:03:35.520 --> 00:03:44.940
 going to be in your name your going to say 

00:03:41.090 --> 00:03:47.880
 generator we will say about them during the 

00:03:44.940 --> 00:03:49.800
 even then there you escape 

00:03:47.880 --> 00:03:51.150
 and no you do not save 

00:03:49.800 --> 00:03:53.850
 applied to the agent card you make 

00:03:51.150 --> 00:03:56.310
 backup and there you saved 

00:03:53.850 --> 00:04:00.180
 the emblem so if you want to know 

00:03:56.310 --> 00:04:02.370
 for what reason save applied 

00:04:00.180 --> 00:04:05.070
 to the map a leg and just because 

00:04:02.370 --> 00:04:06.960
 I'm doing them just now 

00:04:05.070 --> 00:04:08.610
 did me it is that it replaced me my 

00:04:06.960 --> 00:04:12.150
 emblem by the one I wanted to take 

00:04:08.610 --> 00:04:14.160
 so here you lose a flying emblem 

00:04:12.150 --> 00:04:15.690
 there is less what happened is that 

00:04:14.160 --> 00:04:17.489
 I did not lose an emblem but by 

00:04:15.690 --> 00:04:19.200
 so that's the second thing 

00:04:17.489 --> 00:04:20.850
 that can happen you do not lose 

00:04:19.200 --> 00:04:25.200
 from the start m but against your emblem 

00:04:20.850 --> 00:04:28.160
 is not is actually the canvases and 

00:04:25.200 --> 00:04:30.150
 the camp it's called the corporal's eagle 

00:04:28.160 --> 00:04:32.520
 so in fact you have back up and 

00:04:30.150 --> 00:04:34.800
 then there you can choose this emblem 

00:04:32.520 --> 00:04:36.150
 which you do in time I do 

00:04:34.800 --> 00:04:38.700
 save so dude there I know what 

00:04:36.150 --> 00:04:45.230
 smile tickets to save 

00:04:38.700 --> 00:04:45.230
 courses here are the terms of jean 

00:04:48.720 --> 00:04:54.400
 so here is where you have yours 

00:04:52.210 --> 00:04:57.009
 English so here I hope we have you 

00:04:54.400 --> 00:04:58.509
 although we have helped you I hope that 

00:04:57.009 --> 00:04:59.830
