filter<00:01:03.059> so<00:01:03.179> you<00:01:03.239> can<00:01:03.359> get<00:01:03.480> a<00:01:03.510> better<00:01:03.750> look<00:01:03.870> at

00:01:04.189 --> 00:01:04.199 
filter so you can get a better look at

00:01:04.199 --> 00:01:08.390 
filter so you can get a better look at
where<00:01:04.620> the<00:01:04.769> sensor<00:01:05.190> is<00:01:05.370> located<00:01:07.400> alright

00:01:08.390 --> 00:01:08.400 
where the sensor is located alright

00:01:08.400 --> 00:01:25.070 
where the sensor is located alright
let's<00:01:08.550> take<00:01:08.670> a<00:01:08.730> look<00:01:08.970> at<00:01:09.060> that<00:01:09.180> since

00:01:25.070 --> 00:01:25.080 

00:01:25.080 --> 00:01:30.240 

there<00:01:26.080> it<00:01:26.230> is<00:01:26.700> now<00:01:27.700> it's<00:01:27.910> held<00:01:28.150> on<00:01:28.360> by<00:01:28.630> one<00:01:29.380> five

00:01:30.240 --> 00:01:30.250 
there it is now it's held on by one five

00:01:30.250 --> 00:01:33.630 
there it is now it's held on by one five
millimeter<00:01:30.820> headed<00:01:31.360> allen<00:01:31.960> bolt<00:01:32.490> so<00:01:33.490> we're

00:01:33.630 --> 00:01:33.640 
millimeter headed allen bolt so we're

00:01:33.640 --> 00:01:41.970 
millimeter headed allen bolt so we're
going<00:01:33.730> to<00:01:33.790> remove<00:01:34.090> that<00:01:34.330> now<00:01:40.590> all<00:01:41.590> right<00:01:41.710> both

00:01:41.970 --> 00:01:41.980

see<00:02:05.970> if<00:02:06.030> we<00:02:06.210> can<00:02:06.360> pop<00:02:06.810> that<00:02:07.110> sensor<00:02:07.829> out<00:02:08.039> of

00:02:08.180 --> 00:02:08.190 
see if we can pop that sensor out of

00:02:08.190 --> 00:02:45.190 
see if we can pop that sensor out of
there

00:02:45.190 --> 00:02:45.200

part of the connector that goes down to

00:03:08.340 --> 00:03:16.190 
part of the connector that goes down to
the<00:03:08.459> sensor<00:03:08.879> and<00:03:09.410> if<00:03:10.410> we<00:03:10.530> look<00:03:10.739> over<00:03:10.950> here<00:03:15.200> we

00:03:16.190 --> 00:03:16.200 
the sensor and if we look over here we

00:03:16.200 --> 00:03:19.910 
the sensor and if we look over here we
will<00:03:16.410> see<00:03:16.709> a<00:03:16.980> 10<00:03:17.519> millimeter<00:03:17.790> bolt<00:03:18.890> that<00:03:19.890> holds

00:03:19.910 --> 00:03:19.920 
will see a 10 millimeter bolt that holds

00:03:19.920 --> 00:03:24.259 
will see a 10 millimeter bolt that holds
