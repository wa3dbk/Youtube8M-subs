 ah 

00:00:08.360 --> 00:00:12.740
 Hello again life ticos and talks 

00:00:10.670 --> 00:00:15.110
 welcome to a new video to a new 

00:00:12.740 --> 00:00:17.210
 year and to a new season I hope that 

00:00:15.110 --> 00:00:19.340
 this new year is a year full of 

00:00:17.210 --> 00:00:21.710
 surprises and nice things for you 

00:00:19.340 --> 00:00:23.570
 today I bring you a very nice surprise 

00:00:21.710 --> 00:00:25.939
 we started the year with a craft 

00:00:23.570 --> 00:00:27.770
 quite demanding but at the same time 

00:00:25.939 --> 00:00:30.020
 with a very, very nice craft 

00:00:27.770 --> 00:00:32.450
 it is a notes that for this principle 

00:00:30.020 --> 00:00:34.070
 of the year comes very, very well 

00:00:32.450 --> 00:00:36.640
 that accompany in the following video for 

00:00:34.070 --> 00:00:36.640
 see how it is done 

00:00:41.950 --> 00:00:48.590
 for this craft we are going to need 

00:00:44.170 --> 00:00:50.480
 silicone scissors foami of various colors 

00:00:48.590 --> 00:00:53.120
 a mold of a llama that I'm going to 

00:00:50.480 --> 00:00:55.210
 leave on facebook and cardboard to start 

00:00:53.120 --> 00:00:57.710
 let's take the mold of our half 

00:00:55.210 --> 00:00:59.600
 and what we are going to do is put it in the 

00:00:57.710 --> 00:01:02.600
 cardboard and we are going to cut two pieces 

00:00:59.600 --> 00:01:06.470
 equal to this one of these we are going to cut 

00:01:02.600 --> 00:01:09.020
 two let's cut two this big mold 

00:01:06.470 --> 00:01:10.350
 and from this little one we are going to cut six 

00:01:09.020 --> 00:01:12.000
 pieces 

00:01:10.350 --> 00:01:13.380
 in this case the first thing we're going to 

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:16.650
 to do is let's take the silicon and 

00:01:13.380 --> 00:01:20.520
 let's join these two and with another piece 

00:01:16.650 --> 00:01:22.880
 let's join four of these and two of 

00:01:20.520 --> 00:01:22.880
 these 

00:01:31.260 --> 00:01:38.700
 once we have three pieces so one of 

00:01:34.470 --> 00:01:42.350
 four one two and another two we're going to 

00:01:38.700 --> 00:01:44.720
 take this two and we're going to paste 

00:01:42.350 --> 00:01:47.540
 with the other piece of two that 

00:01:44.720 --> 00:01:49.040
 We have it in such a way that we have something left 

00:01:47.540 --> 00:01:50.600
 A) Yes 

00:01:49.040 --> 00:01:52.760
 once we have our pieces 

00:01:50.600 --> 00:01:54.980
 counted what we are going to do is line 

00:01:52.760 --> 00:01:56.660
 those to form the I recommend you 

00:01:54.980 --> 00:01:58.910
 use a very thin paper for 

00:01:56.660 --> 00:02:01.040
 can form the cardboard well with the help of 

00:01:58.910 --> 00:02:03.110
 the tail but if you can not use foami 

00:02:01.040 --> 00:02:04.580
 decorative or you can use any other 

00:02:03.110 --> 00:02:06.410
 type of elements I'm going to close the 

00:02:04.580 --> 00:02:07.620
 back first and then face 

00:02:06.410 --> 00:02:09.990
 the front part 

00:02:07.620 --> 00:02:12.510
 once we have something like that we are going to take 

00:02:09.990 --> 00:02:16.410
 a bowl and a pencil and we're going to bore 

00:02:12.510 --> 00:02:18.420
 on both sides and on the other side of 

00:02:16.410 --> 00:02:21.780
 our layers are not going to form it up 

00:02:18.420 --> 00:02:24.030
 do not put the face and in this case I have 

00:02:21.780 --> 00:02:25.590
 a little face that I have done that is in 

00:02:24.030 --> 00:02:27.390
 the mold so in the mold I will leave you 

00:02:25.590 --> 00:02:28.770
 the face if you do not like this little face 

00:02:27.390 --> 00:02:31.920
 you can make the face that you 

00:02:28.770 --> 00:02:34.770
 want now what I'm going to do to 

00:02:31.920 --> 00:02:36.690
 decorating this part of here is filling it 

00:02:34.770 --> 00:02:38.670
 of colored pompoms you can 

00:02:36.690 --> 00:02:41.040
 use any other type of material 

00:02:38.670 --> 00:02:42.540
 you can line it directly or use a 

00:02:41.040 --> 00:02:44.010
 material that you like most in this 

00:02:42.540 --> 00:02:47.790
 case I 'm going to fill it out so you can propose 

00:02:44.010 --> 00:02:51.000
 see how it is finally with the help of 

00:02:47.790 --> 00:02:52.380
 some strips of the same color that we have 

00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:55.320
 used 

00:02:52.380 --> 00:02:58.760
 we are going to cover the gaps that you see 

00:02:55.320 --> 00:03:01.370
 the cardboard so there are no details 

00:02:58.760 --> 00:03:03.200
 once we have managed to plug 

00:03:01.370 --> 00:03:05.210
 all the holes of our cardboard for 

00:03:03.200 --> 00:03:08.210
 that does not look 

00:03:05.210 --> 00:03:12.880
 I'm going to take a rod and I'm going to 

00:03:08.210 --> 00:03:12.880
 embed with the help of silicone 

00:03:13.069 --> 00:03:16.090
 from this side 

00:03:16.450 --> 00:03:22.860
 I will try to put it to the strongest 

00:03:18.459 --> 00:03:22.860
 possible and I'll let you know that a little 

00:03:24.500 --> 00:03:30.220
 and once it's strong we're going to catch 

00:03:26.750 --> 00:03:30.220
 our roll of paper 

00:03:30.520 --> 00:03:36.630
 and we are going to take and we are going to put silicon 

00:03:33.100 --> 00:03:36.630
 on the same side I want 

00:03:38.900 --> 00:03:47.739
 and we're going to hit this side 

00:03:44.180 --> 00:03:47.739
 let's press hard 

00:03:48.860 --> 00:03:55.100
 on this side and let's dry a 

00:03:51.320 --> 00:03:57.200
 moment once we have something like that I'm going to 

00:03:55.100 --> 00:04:00.260
 take a piece of cardboard and I'll 

00:03:57.200 --> 00:04:04.510
 form the role of the bulk of something that 

00:04:00.260 --> 00:04:04.510
 I want and I'm going to join the legs 

00:04:04.890 --> 00:04:10.560
 a base and finally we would have 

00:04:08.540 --> 00:04:13.260
 our 

00:04:10.560 --> 00:04:15.239
 take notes or what we can put 

00:04:13.260 --> 00:04:17.400
 we can even put more things 

00:04:15.239 --> 00:04:19.889
 add a box so it's also 

00:04:17.400 --> 00:04:22.320
 a pencil holder whatever you want and in this 

00:04:19.889 --> 00:04:25.290
 case I added a small saw that 

00:04:22.320 --> 00:04:27.840
 I had and the truth is that I do not know 

00:04:25.290 --> 00:04:30.120
 what exactly is called but with this 

00:04:27.840 --> 00:04:31.620
 we would go out and count the paper 

00:04:30.120 --> 00:04:34.139
 necessary that we would need to 

00:04:31.620 --> 00:04:37.410
 our notes and that would be a detail 

00:04:34.139 --> 00:04:39.870
 very beautiful and I have here another that I did 

00:04:37.410 --> 00:04:42.210
 before you can previously do it as 

00:04:39.870 --> 00:04:43.830
 you see if you do not have pompoms you can 

00:04:42.210 --> 00:04:46.919
 do it also with a wallpaper like 

00:04:43.830 --> 00:04:49.830
 this one or with comics that will not be left 

00:04:46.919 --> 00:04:51.840
 not as nice nothing happens the 

00:04:49.830 --> 00:04:54.000
 details are very precious I hope that 

00:04:51.840 --> 00:04:55.710
 you liked it, this would be the 

00:04:54.000 --> 00:04:57.240
 final result of our craft I 

00:04:55.710 --> 00:04:59.220
 I hope you liked it you can 

00:04:57.240 --> 00:05:01.380
 give it to whoever you want is 

00:04:59.220 --> 00:05:03.240
 a very simple craft and at the same 

00:05:01.380 --> 00:05:04.500
 very nice time so do not be
