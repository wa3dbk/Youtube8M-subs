 comments would like this what 

00:05:12.169 --> 00:05:15.919
 do more often the subject this of 

00:05:14.030 --> 00:05:18.139
 notify before playing so that 

00:05:15.919 --> 00:05:19.910
 platanitos partition mole a lot 

00:05:18.139 --> 00:05:21.050
 ok or all of you are a dinosaur 

00:05:19.910 --> 00:05:22.430
 very sexy 

00:05:21.050 --> 00:05:24.889
 Look Look Look at how they move and how they look 

00:05:22.430 --> 00:05:26.330
 move the dinosaur for you remember 

00:05:24.889 --> 00:05:28.099
 that if you enter a pig which shot 

00:05:26.330 --> 00:05:29.150
 because in pigs they like a 

00:05:28.099 --> 00:05:30.650
 precipice is that 

00:05:29.150 --> 00:05:34.220
 Tina tells me please bye 

00:05:30.650 --> 00:05:35.570
 little pigs is perfect is xt is that is 

00:05:34.220 --> 00:05:37.220
 pork pork death 

00:05:35.570 --> 00:05:39.080
 pobrecito always ends up asking to 

00:05:37.220 --> 00:05:40.610
 perfect let's get here they are healthy 

00:05:39.080 --> 00:05:42.710
 We are going to try to reach 

00:05:40.610 --> 00:05:44.240
 the pole and what's cool when we play 

00:05:42.710 --> 00:05:45.770
 all together is that 

00:05:44.240 --> 00:05:47.870
 this collection explains a little to be 

00:05:45.770 --> 00:05:49.820
 a game a little individualistic is worth 

00:05:47.870 --> 00:05:51.950
 we are five colors but always usually 

00:05:49.820 --> 00:05:53.990
 be one who kills her because the first 

00:05:51.950 --> 00:05:55.490
 that you will reach a shrinkage is the one 

00:05:53.990 --> 00:05:57.260
 first he will kill the beast and almost 

00:05:55.490 --> 00:05:58.670
 always the one who kills her then when 

00:05:57.260 --> 00:06:00.800
 we all go together because it's cool because 

00:05:58.670 --> 00:06:02.840
 we are a group and now we make our 

00:06:00.800 --> 00:06:05.090
 look for the beast because we were going 2 against 

00:06:02.840 --> 00:06:07.310
 1 3 against 1 4 against some together and 

00:06:05.090 --> 00:06:10.040
 although he has the hook and we are 

00:06:07.310 --> 00:06:12.320
 blinded and even if we make any mess 

00:06:10.040 --> 00:06:14.930
 it is very likely that we win a game 

00:06:12.320 --> 00:06:16.580
 and that's what is cool and he got verbena 

00:06:14.930 --> 00:06:18.560
 this exact here that sometimes I fall 

00:06:16.580 --> 00:06:20.420
 that is, he makes this jump, and I do not get that 

00:06:18.560 --> 00:06:21.950
 true they were paid an uncle get paid 

00:06:20.420 --> 00:06:23.570
 it was removed from the original map and 

00:06:21.950 --> 00:06:25.130
 muscle and that's where a 

00:06:23.570 --> 00:06:26.990
 beast uncle cool a lot a greeting for 

00:06:25.130 --> 00:06:28.820
 Mr. Robert and for all generals 

00:06:26.990 --> 00:06:30.620
 the very thing is all when the 

00:06:28.820 --> 00:06:32.510
 beast and have a lot of desire to play 

00:06:30.620 --> 00:06:33.980
 to olimpo crush because there was more 

00:06:32.510 --> 00:06:35.540
 chances of playing platanitos 

00:06:33.980 --> 00:06:38.510
 with me to the game I hope 

00:06:35.540 --> 00:06:39.620
 that is, we are on the Neymar map and 

00:06:38.510 --> 00:06:41.210

00:06:39.620 --> 00:06:44.240
