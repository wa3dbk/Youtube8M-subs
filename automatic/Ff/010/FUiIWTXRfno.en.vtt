wing and for the tail we were using just

00:00:27.640 --> 00:00:31.200 
wing and for the tail we were using just
coke<00:00:27.910> de<00:00:28.449> Leon<00:00:29.220> you<00:00:30.220> could<00:00:30.369> use<00:00:30.520> any<00:00:30.670> fiber<00:00:30.970> if

00:00:31.200 --> 00:00:31.210 
coke de Leon you could use any fiber if

00:00:31.210 --> 00:00:33.660 
coke de Leon you could use any fiber if
you<00:00:31.330> want<00:00:31.510> I'll<00:00:31.840> even<00:00:31.900> microfiber<00:00:32.680> it's<00:00:32.800> got

off by a thread I'm going to add about a
fluorescence<00:00:40.000> to<00:00:40.150> the<00:00:40.269> fly<00:00:40.589> when<00:00:41.589> you<00:00:41.680> use<00:00:41.800> are

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:42.010 
fluorescence to the fly when you use are

00:00:42.010 --> 00:00:46.020 
fluorescence to the fly when you use are
a<00:00:42.159> uni<00:00:42.580> and<00:00:43.000> the<00:00:43.449> chartreuse<00:00:43.809> any<00:00:44.350> or<00:00:44.850> the<00:00:45.850> hook

00:00:46.020 --> 00:00:46.030 
a uni and the chartreuse any or the hook

00:00:46.030 --> 00:00:51.149 
a uni and the chartreuse any or the hook
is<00:00:46.210> of<00:00:46.390> V<00:00:46.629> 160<00:00:47.440> size<00:00:47.710> 14s<00:00:48.550> more<00:00:49.420> are<00:00:49.629> I<00:00:50.159> would

is of V 160 size 14s more are I would

00:00:51.159 --> 00:00:52.740 
is of V 160 size 14s more are I would
see<00:00:51.309> a<00:00:51.339> sixteen<00:00:51.879> and<00:00:52.000> anthem<00:00:52.330> because<00:00:52.570> of<00:00:52.690> the

00:00:52.740 --> 00:00:52.750 
see a sixteen and anthem because of the

00:00:52.750 --> 00:00:55.160 
see a sixteen and anthem because of the
shank<00:00:52.960> length<00:00:53.140> and<00:00:53.409> the<00:00:54.220> gaps<00:00:54.489> just<00:00:54.670> slightly

00:00:55.160 --> 00:00:55.170 
shank length and the gaps just slightly

00:00:55.170 --> 00:00:59.070 
shank length and the gaps just slightly
obviously<00:00:56.170> more<00:00:57.239> fourteen<00:00:58.239> of<00:00:58.750> they<00:00:58.960> would

00:00:59.070 --> 00:00:59.080 
obviously more fourteen of they would

00:00:59.080 --> 00:01:01.439 
obviously more fourteen of they would
say<00:00:59.260> person<00:01:00.070> HB<00:01:00.309> hook<00:01:00.489> you<00:01:00.879> could<00:01:01.030> use<00:01:01.180> a<00:01:01.210> be

00:01:01.439 --> 00:01:01.449 
say person HB hook you could use a be

00:01:01.449 --> 00:01:03.660 
say person HB hook you could use a be
170<00:01:02.170> something<00:01:02.860> like<00:01:03.010> our<00:01:03.159> if<00:01:03.309> you<00:01:03.370> don't<00:01:03.519> like

this<00:01:03.820> they<00:01:04.030> load<00:01:04.590> but<00:01:05.590> that's<00:01:05.740> so<00:01:06.250> simple<00:01:06.460> easy

00:01:06.810 --> 00:01:06.820 
this they load but that's so simple easy

00:01:06.820 --> 00:01:09.330 
this they load but that's so simple easy
to<00:01:06.940> die<00:01:07.240> and<00:01:07.570> be<00:01:07.600> very<00:01:07.930> effective<00:01:08.290> any<00:01:08.979> color

now<00:01:13.300> I've<00:01:13.780> been<00:01:13.900> doing<00:01:14.110> a<00:01:14.170> letter<00:01:14.320> thread

00:01:14.610 --> 00:01:14.620 
now I've been doing a letter thread

00:01:14.620 --> 00:01:18.350 
now I've been doing a letter thread
first<00:01:15.540> stinger<00:01:16.540> thread<00:01:16.750> down<00:01:17.010> until<00:01:18.010> all

00:01:18.350 --> 00:01:18.360 
first stinger thread down until all

00:01:18.360 --> 00:01:20.700 
first stinger thread down until all
aligned<00:01:19.360> with<00:01:19.390> the<00:01:19.780> bottom<00:01:19.900> of<00:01:20.110> the<00:01:20.170> hook<00:01:20.290> and

00:01:20.700 --> 00:01:20.710 
aligned with the bottom of the hook and

00:01:20.710 --> 00:01:24.120 
aligned with the bottom of the hook and
then<00:01:20.860> remove<00:01:21.220> the<00:01:21.760> waste<00:01:21.940> piece<00:01:22.240> I<00:01:22.890> get<00:01:23.890> caught

00:01:24.120 --> 00:01:24.130 
then remove the waste piece I get caught

00:01:24.130 --> 00:01:27.690 
then remove the waste piece I get caught

00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:33.140 
dozen or so length of the tail confusion
that<00:01:31.120> usually<00:01:31.780> bit<00:01:31.930> rate<00:01:32.110> over<00:01:32.560> the<00:01:32.650> bike

00:01:33.140 --> 00:01:33.150 
that usually bit rate over the bike

00:01:33.150 --> 00:01:35.610 
that usually bit rate over the bike
don't<00:01:34.150> give<00:01:34.660> you<00:01:34.810> a<00:01:34.870> bigger<00:01:35.080> if<00:01:35.200> you<00:01:35.290> wanna

00:01:35.610 --> 00:01:35.620 
don't give you a bigger if you wanna

00:01:35.620 --> 00:01:37.020 
don't give you a bigger if you wanna
stop<00:01:35.770> to<00:01:35.890> yourself<00:01:36.190> but<00:01:36.610> knowing<00:01:36.850> the<00:01:36.940> way

00:01:37.020 --> 00:01:37.030 
stop to yourself but knowing the way

00:01:37.030 --> 00:01:39.660 
stop to yourself but knowing the way
that<00:01:37.210> gives<00:01:37.450> you<00:01:37.570> a<00:01:37.890> because<00:01:38.890> it<00:01:39.100> helps<00:01:39.580> the

00:01:39.660 --> 00:01:39.670 
that gives you a because it helps the

00:01:39.670 --> 00:01:40.950 
that gives you a because it helps the
proportion<00:01:40.120> of<00:01:40.210> the<00:01:40.300> fly<00:01:40.480> if<00:01:40.600> you<00:01:40.690> want<00:01:40.840> with

00:01:40.950 --> 00:01:40.960 
proportion of the fly if you want with

00:01:40.960 --> 00:01:43.320 
proportion of the fly if you want with
something<00:01:41.290> so<00:01:41.620> I'm<00:01:41.830> working<00:01:42.040> with<00:01:42.190> the<00:01:42.490> fill

00:01:43.320 --> 00:01:43.330 
something so I'm working with the fill

00:01:43.330 --> 00:01:45.570 
something so I'm working with the fill

00:01:54.640 --> 00:01:57.149 
hold of the point to the court the Lian
I<00:01:54.850> bring<00:01:55.330> the<00:01:55.450> thread<00:01:55.659> underneath<00:01:55.960> these<00:01:56.290> let

00:01:57.149 --> 00:01:57.159 
I bring the thread underneath these let

00:01:57.159 --> 00:01:59.270 
I bring the thread underneath these let
them<00:01:57.280> go<00:01:57.430> and<00:01:57.700> then<00:01:57.909> bring<00:01:58.090> the<00:01:58.210> thread<00:01:58.390> up

00:01:59.270 --> 00:01:59.280 
them go and then bring the thread up

00:01:59.280 --> 00:02:01.290 
them go and then bring the thread up
basically<00:02:00.280> what<00:02:00.430> that<00:02:00.460> does<00:02:00.580> is<00:02:00.820> left<00:02:01.090> the

00:02:01.290 --> 00:02:01.300 
basically what that does is left the

00:02:01.300 --> 00:02:04.469 
basically what that does is left the
points<00:02:01.750> I<00:02:01.930> left<00:02:02.290> the<00:02:02.500> fiber<00:02:02.740> slightly<00:02:03.479> and

00:02:04.469 --> 00:02:04.479 
points I left the fiber slightly and

00:02:04.479 --> 00:02:09.119 
points I left the fiber slightly and
spreads<00:02:04.840> them<00:02:06.900> I'm<00:02:07.900> not<00:02:08.080> related<00:02:08.470> to<00:02:08.679> the<00:02:08.950> end
