00:01:25.610 --> 00:01:25.620 
with stats and eventually our top tier

00:01:28.250 --> 00:01:28.260 
those are going to be a lot of fun

00:01:28.260 --> 00:01:30.290 
those are going to be a lot of fun
because<00:01:28.710> they<00:01:28.950> stay<00:01:29.190> with<00:01:29.400> you<00:01:29.580> and<00:01:29.760> you're

00:01:31.850 --> 00:01:31.860 
actually able to take items that you

00:01:31.860 --> 00:01:33.410 
actually able to take items that you
found<00:01:32.100> that<00:01:32.190> you<00:01:32.340> can<00:01:32.460> feed<00:01:32.760> those<00:01:32.940> items<00:01:33.180> into

00:01:33.410 --> 00:01:33.420 
found that you can feed those items into

00:01:33.420 --> 00:01:34.730 
found that you can feed those items into
the<00:01:33.480> possessed<00:01:33.840> weapon<00:01:34.140> to<00:01:34.230> increase<00:01:34.590> their

00:01:34.730 --> 00:01:34.740 
the possessed weapon to increase their

00:01:34.740 --> 00:01:35.990 
the possessed weapon to increase their
power<00:01:34.890> essentially<00:01:35.340> the<00:01:35.520> possessed<00:01:35.820> weapons

00:01:35.990 --> 00:01:36.000 
power essentially the possessed weapons

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:38.090 
power essentially the possessed weapons
level<00:01:36.840> up<00:01:36.960> with<00:01:37.110> you<00:01:37.200> based<00:01:37.380> on<00:01:37.530> how<00:01:37.590> often<00:01:37.920> you

00:01:38.090 --> 00:01:38.100 
level up with you based on how often you

00:01:38.100 --> 00:01:39.800 
level up with you based on how often you
feed<00:01:38.460> them<00:01:38.640> with<00:01:39.150> the<00:01:39.300> loot<00:01:39.450> that<00:01:39.540> you<00:01:39.660> don't

00:01:39.800 --> 00:01:39.810 
feed them with the loot that you don't

00:01:39.810 --> 00:01:41.390 
feed them with the loot that you don't
want<00:01:39.990> anymore<00:01:40.170> and<00:01:40.470> I<00:01:40.710> think<00:01:40.920> it's<00:01:41.010> that<00:01:41.070> tier

00:01:41.390 --> 00:01:41.400 
want anymore and I think it's that tier

00:01:41.400 --> 00:01:42.680 
want anymore and I think it's that tier
of<00:01:41.520> loot<00:01:41.730> that<00:01:41.910> we're<00:01:42.060> introducing<00:01:42.510> that's

00:01:42.680 --> 00:01:42.690
