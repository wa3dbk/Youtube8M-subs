see they're different sized boxes so I'm

00:01:06.720 --> 00:01:09.200

00:04:20.340 --> 00:04:20.350 
spawn and neither is she but i think

00:04:20.350 --> 00:04:23.550 
spawn and neither is she but i think
this<00:04:20.440> thing<00:04:20.620> looks<00:04:20.799> really<00:04:21.070> really<00:04:21.430> cool<00:04:21.489> um<00:04:22.560> I

00:04:23.550 --> 00:04:23.560 
this thing looks really really cool um I

00:04:23.560 --> 00:04:25.970 
this thing looks really really cool um I
guess<00:04:24.250> I<00:04:24.340> that's<00:04:24.520> last<00:04:24.730> thing<00:04:24.880> in<00:04:25.030> her<00:04:25.210> box<00:04:25.419> and

00:04:25.970 --> 00:04:25.980 
guess I that's last thing in her box and

00:04:25.980 --> 00:04:28.200 
guess I that's last thing in her box and
she's<00:04:26.980> not<00:04:27.130> exactly<00:04:27.280> thrilled<00:04:27.820> with<00:04:28.090> the

00:04:28.200 --> 00:04:28.210 
she's not exactly thrilled with the

00:04:28.210 --> 00:04:30.120 
she's not exactly thrilled with the
things<00:04:28.390> that<00:04:28.540> she<00:04:28.630> received<00:04:28.960> I<00:04:29.590> think<00:04:29.980> she

00:04:30.120 --> 00:04:30.130 
things that she received I think she

00:04:30.130 --> 00:04:31.440

said<00:04:30.280> the<00:04:30.400> one<00:04:30.520> thing<00:04:30.550> she<00:04:30.730> wants<00:04:30.910> to<00:04:30.970> keep<00:04:31.150> is

00:04:31.440 --> 00:04:31.450 
said the one thing she wants to keep is

00:04:31.450 --> 00:04:33.000 
said the one thing she wants to keep is

little<00:05:51.850> walking<00:05:52.120> dead<00:05:52.240> puzzle<00:05:52.630> I<00:05:52.780> don't<00:05:53.560> know

00:05:53.880 --> 00:05:53.890 
little walking dead puzzle I don't know

00:05:53.890 --> 00:05:56.550 
little walking dead puzzle I don't know
is<00:05:54.310> it<00:05:54.580> the<00:05:54.669> same<00:05:54.850> looks<00:05:55.810> like<00:05:55.960> it's<00:05:56.200> the<00:05:56.350> same

00:05:56.550 --> 00:05:56.560 
is it the same looks like it's the same

00:05:56.560 --> 00:06:00.090 
is it the same looks like it's the same
actually<00:05:58.229> yeah<00:05:59.229> it<00:05:59.320> doesn't<00:05:59.500> make<00:05:59.710> the<00:05:59.860> same

00:06:00.090 --> 00:06:00.100 
actually yeah it doesn't make the same

00:06:00.100 --> 00:06:03.090 
actually yeah it doesn't make the same
so<00:06:00.729> I'm<00:06:01.150> assuming<00:06:01.900> one<00:06:02.680> of<00:06:02.770> these<00:06:02.890> will

00:06:03.090 --> 00:06:03.100 
so I'm assuming one of these will

00:06:03.100 --> 00:06:05.940 
so I'm assuming one of these will
probably<00:06:03.370> end<00:06:03.460> up<00:06:03.610> in<00:06:04.150> the<00:06:04.590> buy<00:06:05.590> sell<00:06:05.919> trade

00:06:05.940 --> 00:06:05.950 
probably end up in the buy sell trade

00:06:05.950 --> 00:06:08.820 
probably end up in the buy sell trade
group<00:06:06.400> that<00:06:06.700> we<00:06:06.820> run<00:06:07.180> so<00:06:07.510> keep<00:06:08.260> an<00:06:08.350> eye<00:06:08.440> out<00:06:08.470> for

00:06:08.820 --> 00:06:08.830 
group that we run so keep an eye out for

00:06:08.830 --> 00:06:10.230 
group that we run so keep an eye out for
it<00:06:08.860> because<00:06:09.160> there's<00:06:09.520> no<00:06:09.669> reason<00:06:09.940> for<00:06:10.090> same

00:06:10.230 --> 00:06:10.240 
it because there's no reason for same

00:06:10.240 --> 00:06:13.080 
it because there's no reason for same
two<00:06:10.390> of<00:06:10.510> them<00:06:10.890> next<00:06:11.890> up<00:06:12.010> we<00:06:12.160> have<00:06:12.190> a<00:06:12.490> brain-dead

00:06:13.080 --> 00:06:13.090 
two of them next up we have a brain-dead

00:06:13.090 --> 00:06:16.050 
two of them next up we have a brain-dead
zombies<00:06:13.660> grow<00:06:14.050> is<00:06:14.260> on<00:06:14.440> be<00:06:14.620> part<00:06:14.919> girls<00:06:15.880> up<00:06:16.030> to

00:06:16.050 --> 00:06:16.060 
zombies grow is on be part girls up to

00:06:16.060 --> 00:06:18.750 
zombies grow is on be part girls up to
600<00:06:16.660> to<00:06:16.960> glow<00:06:17.140> in<00:06:17.200> the<00:06:17.260> dark<00:06:17.500> just<00:06:18.490> add<00:06:18.729> water
