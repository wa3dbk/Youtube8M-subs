do<00:00:09.809> we<00:00:09.960> got<00:00:10.080> the<00:00:10.170> warthog<00:00:10.590> the<00:00:10.769> lower<00:00:10.980> star<00:00:11.340> and

00:00:11.660 --> 00:00:11.670 
do we got the warthog the lower star and

00:00:11.670 --> 00:00:14.629 
do we got the warthog the lower star and
the<00:00:12.360> VTOL<00:00:12.750> warship<00:00:13.139> loadstar<00:00:14.070> is<00:00:14.190> probably<00:00:14.490> my

00:00:14.629 --> 00:00:14.639 
the VTOL warship loadstar is probably my

00:00:14.639 --> 00:00:16.519 
the VTOL warship loadstar is probably my
personal<00:00:15.120> favorite<00:00:15.540> now<00:00:15.719> just<00:00:15.990> because<00:00:16.320> it's

00:00:16.519 --> 00:00:16.529 
personal favorite now just because it's

00:00:16.529 --> 00:00:22.130 
personal favorite now just because it's
a<00:00:16.619> reaper<00:00:16.980> but<00:00:18.590> 10<00:00:19.590> times<00:00:19.800> as<00:00:20.160> good<00:00:20.430> so<00:00:21.140> it's

00:00:22.130 --> 00:00:22.140 
a reaper but 10 times as good so it's

00:00:22.140 --> 00:00:24.620 
a reaper but 10 times as good so it's
very<00:00:22.320> impressive<00:00:22.560> it<00:00:22.859> kills<00:00:23.070> instantly<00:00:23.970> the

00:00:24.620 --> 00:00:24.630 
very impressive it kills instantly the

00:00:24.630 --> 00:00:27.589 
very impressive it kills instantly the
missiles<00:00:24.930> home<00:00:25.230> in<00:00:25.670> pretty<00:00:26.670> quick<00:00:26.910> that

00:00:27.589 --> 00:00:27.599 
missiles home in pretty quick that

00:00:27.599 --> 00:00:31.580 
missiles home in pretty quick that
doesn't<00:00:27.810> really<00:00:27.990> take<00:00:28.230> very<00:00:28.439> long<00:00:28.650> and<00:00:30.019> it's<00:00:31.019> I

00:00:31.580 --> 00:00:31.590 
doesn't really take very long and it's I

00:00:31.590 --> 00:00:35.180 
doesn't really take very long and it's I
don't<00:00:32.070> know<00:00:32.219> note<00:00:32.759> the<00:00:32.940> thing<00:00:33.149> so<00:00:33.980> this<00:00:34.980> is<00:00:35.100> the

00:00:35.180 --> 00:00:35.190 
don't know note the thing so this is the

00:00:35.190 --> 00:00:37.340 
don't know note the thing so this is the
g11<00:00:35.420> clone<00:00:36.420> that<00:00:36.570> I<00:00:36.630> was<00:00:36.750> talking<00:00:36.899> about<00:00:37.079> he's

00:00:37.340 --> 00:00:37.350 
g11 clone that I was talking about he's

00:00:37.350 --> 00:00:39.190 
g11 clone that I was talking about he's
gonna<00:00:37.469> silence<00:00:37.829> her<00:00:38.100> and<00:00:38.340> I've<00:00:38.430> got<00:00:38.610> I<00:00:38.879> believe

gonna silence her and I've got I believe

00:00:39.200 --> 00:00:42.470 
gonna silence her and I've got I believe
quick-draw<00:00:40.200> so<00:00:40.410> I<00:00:40.440> can<00:00:40.590> aim<00:00:40.710> faster<00:00:40.950> no<00:00:41.969> fast

00:00:42.470 --> 00:00:42.480 
quick-draw so I can aim faster no fast

00:00:42.480 --> 00:00:46.959 
quick-draw so I can aim faster no fast
mag<00:00:42.690> here<00:00:42.989> so<00:00:44.600> honestly<00:00:45.600> I<00:00:45.780> could<00:00:46.559> play

don't even know I want to say like 35
minutes<00:00:59.460> just<00:00:59.760> killing<00:01:00.120> BOTS<00:01:00.300> basically<00:01:00.809> just

00:01:01.010 --> 00:01:01.020 
minutes just killing BOTS basically just

00:01:01.020 --> 00:01:02.779 
minutes just killing BOTS basically just
learning<00:01:01.289> the<00:01:01.379> map<00:01:01.559> and<00:01:01.710> I<00:01:01.770> have<00:01:01.949> the<00:01:02.250> radar<00:01:02.460> on

00:01:02.779 --> 00:01:02.789 
learning the map and I have the radar on

00:01:02.789 --> 00:01:04.490 
learning the map and I have the radar on
so<00:01:03.510> that<00:01:03.660> you<00:01:03.780> can<00:01:03.899> always<00:01:04.170> know<00:01:04.320> where

00:01:04.490 --> 00:01:04.500 
so that you can always know where

00:01:04.500 --> 00:01:06.080 
so that you can always know where
everyone's<00:01:04.830> at<00:01:05.010> so<00:01:05.189> you<00:01:05.280> get<00:01:05.400> an<00:01:05.489> idea<00:01:05.790> of<00:01:05.850> the

00:01:06.080 --> 00:01:06.090 
everyone's at so you get an idea of the

00:01:06.090 --> 00:01:07.640 
everyone's at so you get an idea of the
way<00:01:06.210> spawns<00:01:06.570> are<00:01:06.780> flowing<00:01:07.200> and<00:01:07.290> stuff<00:01:07.500> like

00:01:07.640 --> 00:01:07.650 
way spawns are flowing and stuff like

00:01:07.650 --> 00:01:09.530 
way spawns are flowing and stuff like
that<00:01:07.860> so<00:01:07.890> that's<00:01:08.640> why<00:01:08.820> I<00:01:08.850> have<00:01:09.030> them<00:01:09.150> on<00:01:09.299> it's<00:01:09.510> a

00:01:09.530 --> 00:01:09.540 
that so that's why I have them on it's a

00:01:09.540 --> 00:01:10.969 
that so that's why I have them on it's a
good<00:01:09.689> way<00:01:09.810> to<00:01:09.840> learn<00:01:10.049> the<00:01:10.170> maps<00:01:10.409> whenever<00:01:10.860> you

00:01:10.969 --> 00:01:10.979 
good way to learn the maps whenever you

00:01:10.979 --> 00:01:13.520 
good way to learn the maps whenever you
get<00:01:11.130> the<00:01:11.220> game<00:01:11.630> and<00:01:12.630> I<00:01:12.689> did<00:01:12.869> that<00:01:12.990> for<00:01:13.140> black

00:01:13.520 --> 00:01:13.530 
get the game and I did that for black

00:01:13.530 --> 00:01:15.230 
get the game and I did that for black
ops<00:01:13.710> as<00:01:13.860> well<00:01:14.070> when<00:01:14.729> I<00:01:14.790> played<00:01:15.030> that<00:01:15.060> earlier

00:01:15.230 --> 00:01:15.240 
ops as well when I played that earlier

00:01:15.240 --> 00:01:18.980 
ops as well when I played that earlier
back<00:01:15.930> in<00:01:15.960> 2010<00:01:16.680> so<00:01:17.580> it's<00:01:18.570> always<00:01:18.720> something

00:01:18.980 --> 00:01:18.990 
back in 2010 so it's always something

00:01:18.990 --> 00:01:20.060 
back in 2010 so it's always something
that<00:01:19.080> helps<00:01:19.229> you<00:01:19.290> learn<00:01:19.409> the<00:01:19.560> maps<00:01:19.740> you<00:01:19.860> get<00:01:19.979> an

00:01:20.060 --> 00:01:20.070 
that helps you learn the maps you get an

00:01:20.070 --> 00:01:21.670 
that helps you learn the maps you get an
idea<00:01:20.310> of<00:01:20.340> where<00:01:20.580> everyone<00:01:20.820> is<00:01:21.000> that<00:01:21.119> and

00:01:21.670 --> 00:01:21.680 
idea of where everyone is that and

00:01:21.680 --> 00:01:23.960 
idea of where everyone is that and
although<00:01:22.680> when<00:01:22.890> I<00:01:22.950> did<00:01:23.100> on<00:01:23.250> black<00:01:23.460> ops<00:01:23.640> I<00:01:23.790> just

00:01:23.960 --> 00:01:23.970 
although when I did on black ops I just

00:01:23.970 --> 00:01:26.230 
although when I did on black ops I just
did<00:01:24.090> it<00:01:24.180> on<00:01:24.270> combat<00:01:24.720> training<00:01:24.990> and<00:01:25.140> it<00:01:25.320> was<00:01:25.500> on

00:01:26.230 --> 00:01:26.240 
did it on combat training and it was on

00:01:26.240 --> 00:01:27.440 
did it on combat training and it was on
Nuketown

00:01:27.440 --> 00:01:27.450 
Nuketown

00:01:27.450 --> 00:01:31.370

00:01:42.950 --> 00:01:42.960 
is the lodestar right here and honestly

00:01:42.960 --> 00:01:45.020 
is the lodestar right here and honestly
I<00:01:43.140> don't<00:01:43.950> know<00:01:44.159> I<00:01:44.189> mean<00:01:44.460> if<00:01:44.579> you<00:01:44.700> run<00:01:44.880> these

00:01:57.350 --> 00:01:57.360 
easy to pull this off I mean even these

00:01:57.360 --> 00:01:59.690 
easy to pull this off I mean even these
bots<00:01:57.750> if<00:01:58.049> I<00:01:58.170> play<00:01:58.439> the<00:01:58.619> bots<00:01:58.799> on<00:01:59.070> hardened<00:01:59.490> I

00:01:59.690 --> 00:01:59.700 
bots if I play the bots on hardened I

00:01:59.700 --> 00:02:01.609 
bots if I play the bots on hardened I
won't<00:02:00.509> be<00:02:00.659> able<00:02:00.780> to<00:02:00.869> get<00:02:00.990> these<00:02:01.140> streaks<00:02:01.409> like

00:02:01.609 --> 00:02:01.619 
won't be able to get these streaks like

00:02:01.619 --> 00:02:03.410 
won't be able to get these streaks like
that<00:02:01.799> because<00:02:02.219> they<00:02:02.399> I<00:02:02.640> mean<00:02:02.820> they're<00:02:03.090> unfair

00:02:03.410 --> 00:02:03.420 
that because they I mean they're unfair

00:02:03.420 --> 00:02:04.730 
that because they I mean they're unfair
because<00:02:03.750> they're<00:02:03.930> you<00:02:04.110> know<00:02:04.200> they<00:02:04.320> can<00:02:04.439> aimbot

00:02:04.730 --> 00:02:04.740 
because they're you know they can aimbot

00:02:04.740 --> 00:02:06.590 
because they're you know they can aimbot
you<00:02:04.860> but<00:02:05.009> still<00:02:05.189> I<00:02:05.430> mean<00:02:05.969> my<00:02:06.119> point<00:02:06.329> is<00:02:06.570> that

00:02:06.590 --> 00:02:06.600 
you but still I mean my point is that

00:02:06.600 --> 00:02:09.680 
you but still I mean my point is that
when<00:02:06.840> you<00:02:06.930> play<00:02:07.110> the<00:02:07.259> game<00:02:07.290> on<00:02:08.390> online<00:02:09.390> it's

00:02:09.680 --> 00:02:09.690 
when you play the game on online it's

00:02:09.690 --> 00:02:10.880 
when you play the game on online it's
not<00:02:09.810> gonna<00:02:09.959> be<00:02:10.140> like<00:02:10.259> this<00:02:10.440> at<00:02:10.530> all<00:02:10.619> and<00:02:10.800> I'm

00:02:10.880 --> 00:02:10.890 
not gonna be like this at all and I'm

00:02:10.890 --> 00:02:12.440 
not gonna be like this at all and I'm
definitely<00:02:11.069> gonna<00:02:11.340> get<00:02:11.580> these<00:02:11.790> streaks<00:02:12.120> for

00:02:12.440 --> 00:02:12.450 
definitely gonna get these streaks for

00:02:12.450 --> 00:02:13.340 
definitely gonna get these streaks for
sure<00:02:12.629> it's<00:02:12.870> just

00:02:13.340 --> 00:02:13.350 
sure it's just

00:02:13.350 --> 00:02:16.100 
sure it's just
I<00:02:13.440> feel<00:02:14.220> like<00:02:14.340> it's<00:02:14.460> gonna<00:02:14.550> be<00:02:14.700> a<00:02:14.730> lot<00:02:15.110> more

00:02:16.100 --> 00:02:16.110 
I feel like it's gonna be a lot more

00:02:16.110 --> 00:02:18.070 
I feel like it's gonna be a lot more
challenging<00:02:16.170> than<00:02:17.070> people<00:02:17.430> realize

00:02:18.070 --> 00:02:18.080 
challenging than people realize

00:02:18.080 --> 00:02:22.280 
challenging than people realize
because<00:02:19.080> 1,900<00:02:19.680> points<00:02:19.950> for<00:02:20.070> a<00:02:20.100> swarm<00:02:21.290> 1500

00:02:22.280 --> 00:02:22.290 
because 1,900 points for a swarm 1500

00:02:22.290 --> 00:02:24.350 
because 1,900 points for a swarm 1500
for<00:02:22.440> dogs<00:02:22.620> or<00:02:22.860> 1700<00:02:23.280> I<00:02:23.610> think<00:02:23.790> is<00:02:23.880> 17<00:02:24.180> under

00:02:24.350 --> 00:02:24.360 
for dogs or 1700 I think is 17 under

00:02:24.360 --> 00:02:27.110 
for dogs or 1700 I think is 17 under
whatever<00:02:24.630> it<00:02:24.780> is<00:02:24.900> it's<00:02:25.440> ridiculous<00:02:25.980> so<00:02:26.250> it's

00:02:27.110 --> 00:02:27.120 
whatever it is it's ridiculous so it's

00:02:27.120 --> 00:02:28.610 
whatever it is it's ridiculous so it's
gonna<00:02:27.270> take<00:02:27.450> a<00:02:27.540> lot<00:02:27.690> you<00:02:27.840> got<00:02:27.960> to<00:02:28.140> cap<00:02:28.290> flags

00:02:28.610 --> 00:02:28.620 
gonna take a lot you got to cap flags

00:02:28.620 --> 00:02:30.290 
gonna take a lot you got to cap flags
you<00:02:28.830> have<00:02:28.950> to<00:02:29.040> confirm<00:02:29.370> tags<00:02:29.700> all<00:02:30.000> that<00:02:30.150> good

00:02:30.290 --> 00:02:30.300 
you have to confirm tags all that good

00:02:30.300 --> 00:02:32.600 
you have to confirm tags all that good

00:02:38.280 --> 00:02:39.800 
like everyone's gonna have to shoot it

00:02:39.800 --> 00:02:39.810 
down because it's so strong

00:02:39.810 --> 00:02:41.330 
down because it's so strong

00:02:41.330 --> 00:02:41.340 
what's cool about is you can manually

00:02:41.340 --> 00:02:43.640 
what's cool about is you can manually
choose<00:02:41.790> to<00:02:42.210> move<00:02:42.600> to<00:02:42.780> a<00:02:42.810> new<00:02:42.960> location<00:02:43.110> so
