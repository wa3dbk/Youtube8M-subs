 I bring the video of favorite favorites 

00:00:05.680 --> 00:00:11.559
 of the moment because you already know that I do not 

00:00:08.559 --> 00:00:13.839
 I have favorite things often and for 

00:00:11.559 --> 00:00:15.999
 that I bring you in favorites 2 - of these 

00:00:13.839 --> 00:00:19.330
 things that we are using in this 

00:00:15.999 --> 00:00:21.130
 piece of summer that we have spent and already 

00:00:19.330 --> 00:00:22.630
 I hope you like it and we are going to 

00:00:21.130 --> 00:00:24.490
 start 

00:00:22.630 --> 00:00:27.279
 first of all let's start with 

00:00:24.490 --> 00:00:28.929
 the beauty part with them and what 

00:00:27.279 --> 00:00:31.660
 First of all I have this lipstick 

00:00:28.929 --> 00:00:34.269
 that is wet and white is the one that has 

00:00:31.660 --> 00:00:37.570
 youtube whole that is the cherry pam 

00:00:34.269 --> 00:00:40.690
 this is a super dark tone and really 

00:00:37.570 --> 00:00:42.879
 I am amazed and scared because 

00:00:40.690 --> 00:00:45.760
 there is a lot on the lip does not move 

00:00:42.879 --> 00:00:48.760
 nothing lasts very much and the best thing is that it is 

00:00:45.760 --> 00:00:50.769
 super cheap that cost 290 or something 

00:00:48.760 --> 00:00:53.450
 so I really recommended it 

00:00:50.769 --> 00:00:55.910
 heap and that that takes the lips 

00:00:53.450 --> 00:00:58.730
 and 100 recommended the following is a 

00:00:55.910 --> 00:01:01.520
 nail polish and it's basically because of the color 

00:00:58.730 --> 00:01:03.980
 because I had a little problem with 

00:01:01.520 --> 00:01:05.840
 this nail polish and is that I was in 

00:01:03.980 --> 00:01:08.060
 kiko and had to catch things fast 

00:01:05.840 --> 00:01:10.500
 and then nothing caught the first nail polish 

00:01:08.060 --> 00:01:14.070
 white that I saw and now 

00:01:10.500 --> 00:01:15.990
 in an enlargement that the brush is the 

00:01:14.070 --> 00:01:18.800
 brush to make the French manicure and 

00:01:15.990 --> 00:01:22.020
 if I painted my nails in texas congress 

00:01:18.800 --> 00:01:24.240
 I do not know how I did it ring but good 

00:01:22.020 --> 00:01:26.250
 with a lot of patience and I will finish 

00:01:24.240 --> 00:01:28.110
 buying the normal brush because with 

00:01:26.250 --> 00:01:29.550
 this me in new heap and mediation what 

00:01:28.110 --> 00:01:31.680
 next I want to show you is this 

00:01:29.550 --> 00:01:33.840
 palette good our palette of shadows 

00:01:31.680 --> 00:01:36.240
 that I bought it in the h &amp; m sales 

00:01:33.840 --> 00:01:39.090
 because it was all 50% and I think that I 

00:01:36.240 --> 00:01:42.060
 It cost two euros or something and I needed 

00:01:39.090 --> 00:01:44.580
 one of 'news and this one saves me because 

00:01:42.060 --> 00:01:46.740
 I also put a lot of shadow and nothing good 

00:01:44.580 --> 00:01:49.200
 in very neutral colors on all use 

00:01:46.740 --> 00:01:51.960
 the one in the middle that to unify the color 

00:01:49.200 --> 00:01:54.180
 of my eyelids is perfect and I 

00:01:51.960 --> 00:01:56.460
 I know it's super good it 's very cheap that 

00:01:54.180 --> 00:02:00.720
 you catch it but you made in your bag 

00:01:56.460 --> 00:02:03.460
 It fits and saves you from a hurry I know 

00:02:00.720 --> 00:02:06.460
 finally this has no beauty 

00:02:03.460 --> 00:02:10.149
 or anything I do not know what is this colony that is 

00:02:06.460 --> 00:02:11.920
 of zara is called love does not life and with 

00:02:10.149 --> 00:02:13.989
 this colony because I fell in love because 

00:02:11.920 --> 00:02:16.750
 it reminded me of the smell of hollister I 

00:02:13.989 --> 00:02:18.700
 I said to my mother and then she says good 

00:02:16.750 --> 00:02:22.810
 take the music and see that it will cost ten 

00:02:18.700 --> 00:02:24.130
 euros and then the box and they did not square and 

00:02:22.810 --> 00:02:26.310
 the sum of prices that the 

00:02:24.130 --> 00:02:26.310
 boy 

00:02:27.130 --> 00:02:34.620
 and we looked at the ticket and it cost 499 already 

00:02:30.820 --> 00:02:36.880
 I died of love smells very much like 

00:02:34.620 --> 00:02:39.160
 hollister or me reminds me of 

00:02:36.880 --> 00:02:41.110
 hollister atmosphere and really that the 

00:02:39.160 --> 00:02:43.450
 I recommend a lot and if you have time 

00:02:41.110 --> 00:02:45.670
 a zara nearby approach you to open line and 

00:02:43.450 --> 00:02:47.350
 It's worth it a lot to buy the 

00:02:45.670 --> 00:02:49.240
 because it costs nothing money over 

00:02:47.350 --> 00:02:52.870
 comes enough from ximena now we go to 

00:02:49.240 --> 00:02:55.510
 fashion or the fashionable east section and what 

00:02:52.870 --> 00:02:57.640
 first of all and it is something that you will be 

00:02:55.510 --> 00:03:00.790
 watching every day down the street to 

00:02:57.640 --> 00:03:03.220
 millions of people and it is the famous all 

00:03:00.790 --> 00:03:06.310
 of pull and bear that Spain has and 

00:03:03.220 --> 00:03:08.200
 is whole and more and then nothing is that of 

00:03:06.310 --> 00:03:10.990
 crochet is not the garnet I've already taught 

00:03:08.200 --> 00:03:13.000
 in a lot of videos and it's just that I'm 

00:03:10.990 --> 00:03:15.520
 in love I do not really take it off 

00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:17.410
 Even if it is crochet, it does not heat much 

00:03:15.520 --> 00:03:20.110
 girls you asked me for private 

00:03:17.410 --> 00:03:22.450
 for comments that how do I make it so that 

00:03:20.110 --> 00:03:24.670
 bra not see me but that is 

00:03:22.450 --> 00:03:25.900
 how to use it first obviously what 

00:03:24.670 --> 00:03:27.760
 what you have to do is use a 

00:03:25.900 --> 00:03:29.170
 bra that does not have braces and 

00:03:27.760 --> 00:03:31.000
 put on what 

00:03:29.170 --> 00:03:32.890
 below the usual that you put it 

00:03:31.000 --> 00:03:35.620
 in the back then just to cover 

00:03:32.890 --> 00:03:37.540
 the band and you're going to move twice to 

00:03:35.620 --> 00:03:40.690
 day that is not uncomfortable and what 

00:03:37.540 --> 00:03:43.030
 I am very much recommend season 

00:03:40.690 --> 00:03:44.709
 if I also had the following surely 

00:03:43.030 --> 00:03:47.680
 You have also seen it because I have 

00:03:44.709 --> 00:03:50.770
 photos in Instagram and these are beautiful 

00:03:47.680 --> 00:03:52.480
 basically these pants do to 

00:03:50.770 --> 00:03:54.700
 all types of pants that way 

00:03:52.480 --> 00:03:56.890
 like flo fish because this summer 

00:03:54.700 --> 00:03:58.750
 I take them off because I got used to 

00:03:56.890 --> 00:04:00.400
 carry this kind of thing and what of 

00:03:58.750 --> 00:04:02.470
 put me some trucks it seems a bit 

00:04:00.400 --> 00:04:04.690
 uncomfortable I keep doing it but it's that 

00:04:02.470 --> 00:04:07.120
 I live happier and more predictions 

00:04:04.690 --> 00:04:10.630
 these things and these in particular are from 

00:04:07.120 --> 00:04:12.970
 saná and I have more style and and because 

00:04:10.630 --> 00:04:14.440
 last fashionable and those things are about 

00:04:12.970 --> 00:04:19.230
 shoes like there is not a madwoman in 

00:04:14.440 --> 00:04:22.510
 shoes are these sandals that 

00:04:19.230 --> 00:04:24.430
 but only sandals 

00:04:22.510 --> 00:04:26.590
 this guy willy like the ones I teach you 

00:04:24.430 --> 00:04:29.230
 in the saná hall but these are from 

00:04:26.590 --> 00:04:31.450
 double law in one was also bought in 

00:04:29.230 --> 00:04:34.600
 rebates and are from the platforms to me 

00:04:31.450 --> 00:04:36.310
 I flip on the platforms and then I do not 

00:04:34.600 --> 00:04:38.170
 I remove this the same foot that I have 

00:04:36.310 --> 00:04:39.970
 him two weeks ago or so and there are 

00:04:38.170 --> 00:04:43.120
 I have done a bit of chafing 

00:04:39.970 --> 00:04:45.780
 but I really love them and they are 

00:04:43.120 --> 00:04:45.780
 good ones 

00:04:46.600 --> 00:04:55.690
 and lastly of objects that I 'm going to 

00:04:51.490 --> 00:04:58.030
 teach is these bracelets that go up 

00:04:55.690 --> 00:05:00.550
 instagram photos and I sent them the 

00:04:58.030 --> 00:05:03.820
 pixbox page that many thanks 

00:05:00.550 --> 00:05:07.060
 and it's these bracelets that one is like that 

00:05:03.820 --> 00:05:08.590
 as with little feet are the two silver and 

00:05:07.060 --> 00:05:10.000
 I really recommend a lot 

00:05:08.590 --> 00:05:12.190
 this shop especially to do 

00:05:10.000 --> 00:05:13.540
 gifts a little more special good if 

00:05:12.190 --> 00:05:16.300
 which is also for you too 

00:05:13.540 --> 00:05:18.160
 but as it is a little more high jewelry 

00:05:16.300 --> 00:05:20.950
 quality is not typical of a store 

00:05:18.160 --> 00:05:22.570
 Well, I recommend you invest more 

00:05:20.950 --> 00:05:25.330
 money if they are for special occasions 

00:05:22.570 --> 00:05:28.720
 or something because they are very good from very 

00:05:25.330 --> 00:05:32.950
 good quality and I really love them and 

00:05:28.720 --> 00:05:35.290
 They are very beautiful and I think they cost 34 

00:05:32.950 --> 00:05:38.409
 euros so if it's a bit expensive but what 

00:05:35.290 --> 00:05:40.959
 what do I say for a gift for your mother 

00:05:38.409 --> 00:05:44.349
 for anything of those super good 

00:05:40.959 --> 00:05:46.330
 gift and also things we are going to spend 

00:05:44.349 --> 00:05:49.330
 for the random things and those things that are 

00:05:46.330 --> 00:05:50.800
 they say at the end of the video and the first 

00:05:49.330 --> 00:05:54.779
 What I want to teach you is a song 

00:05:50.800 --> 00:05:54.779
 obviously the crazy music 

00:05:58.060 --> 00:06:03.340
 and the song for which I am 

00:06:00.790 --> 00:06:08.410
 sincerely super-love is that of 

00:06:03.340 --> 00:06:10.969
 writers lovers of look if such if it is a 

00:06:08.410 --> 00:06:13.399
 lovely song 

00:06:10.969 --> 00:06:15.819
 that you only have to listen to 

00:06:13.399 --> 00:06:15.819
 fall in love 

00:06:19.639 --> 00:06:25.720
 Thank you 

00:06:22.630 --> 00:06:28.240
 I want to teach you and it is an application 

00:06:25.720 --> 00:06:29.560
 a game in itself I never have few in 

00:06:28.240 --> 00:06:31.360
 either mobile or do not know why me 

00:06:29.560 --> 00:06:34.480
 download and why did I look for it 

00:06:31.360 --> 00:06:37.030
 I do not know what kind of divine inspiration I 

00:06:34.480 --> 00:06:41.020
 lit that night but in the boring 

00:06:37.030 --> 00:06:43.450
 too much and I downloaded a game that is 

00:06:41.020 --> 00:06:45.810
 wonderful is called frame 2 and it's a 

00:06:43.450 --> 00:06:47.620
 game that has me quite hooked and 

00:06:45.810 --> 00:06:50.140
 basically what you have to do is 

00:06:47.620 --> 00:06:52.150
 join two dots and you already have to 

00:06:50.140 --> 00:06:54.010
 draw because the drawings have 

00:06:52.150 --> 00:06:55.990
 gravity and get hooked on 

00:06:54.010 --> 00:06:58.090
 things that are out there not then the 

00:06:55.990 --> 00:07:00.910
 balls have to make the circuit that 

00:06:58.090 --> 00:07:02.500
 you do and finally you can count the 

00:07:00.910 --> 00:07:03.760
 moment of the month and one of the things that 

00:07:02.500 --> 00:07:06.250
 I liked this month 

00:07:03.760 --> 00:07:08.050
 has been the one that gives the aura yanes and we 

00:07:06.250 --> 00:07:09.970
 we put in contact with her so 

00:07:08.050 --> 00:07:12.130
 we could stay before it was 

00:07:09.970 --> 00:07:14.170
 Hangout we had a super good to me 

00:07:12.130 --> 00:07:16.060
 he was very excited to know them not 

00:07:14.170 --> 00:07:18.400
 he knew most of what was there 

00:07:16.060 --> 00:07:20.440
 and what is done is a link and that 

00:07:18.400 --> 00:07:22.790
 I send you a heavy 

00:07:20.440 --> 00:07:25.040
