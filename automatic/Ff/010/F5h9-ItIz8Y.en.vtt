00:00:00.840 --> 00:00:05.310

00:00:05.310 --> 00:00:07.840
Today as part of The Tesco Eat Happy Project

00:00:07.840 --> 00:00:10.980
We're going to make some delicious Enchiladas

00:00:10.980 --> 00:00:13.140
and I've got some helpers

00:00:13.140 --> 00:00:17.500
Hi I'm Rosie and I'm 6. Hi I'm Archie and I'm 8

00:00:17.500 --> 00:00:19.440
Hi I'm Evie and I'm 11

00:00:19.440 --> 00:00:21.180
and this is a great Mexican recipe

00:00:21.180 --> 00:00:23.400
to get the kids involved in cooking

00:00:23.400 --> 00:00:26.860
So our hands are washed, hair tied back. You ready guys?

00:00:26.860 --> 00:00:28.140
YEAH! [Shouts]

00:00:28.140 --> 00:00:29.440
Step One

00:00:29.900 --> 00:00:32.840
Use a tablespoon of oil (pop that in)

00:00:32.840 --> 00:00:33.780
(good boy)

00:00:33.780 --> 00:00:35.780
To grease a large frying pan

00:00:35.780 --> 00:00:38.240
(Make sure it's all covered all the way over)

00:00:38.720 --> 00:00:40.900
(Oh look at that, well done)

00:00:40.900 --> 00:00:42.260
Step Two

00:00:42.860 --> 00:00:45.040
Okay Evie's gonna help me with this bit

00:00:45.040 --> 00:00:47.400
We're gonna use a nice sturdy chopping board

00:00:47.410 --> 00:00:50.570
and we have to be careful because we're using a sharp knife to chop the onions

00:00:50.570 --> 00:00:52.530
Yep, that's exactly right

00:00:52.530 --> 00:00:55.170
The claw technique helps to keep fingers safe

00:00:55.170 --> 00:00:56.610
Make a claw with your hand

00:00:56.610 --> 00:00:59.330
as if you're digging your finger nails into the onion

00:00:59.330 --> 00:01:00.560
Using this as a guide

00:01:00.570 --> 00:01:04.610
slide the sharp side of the knife carefully through the onion

00:01:04.610 --> 00:01:06.910
Right now we're going to get them all in the pan

00:01:07.940 --> 00:01:12.200
(All done) and then we're going to add some garlic

00:01:12.200 --> 00:01:14.620
Fry the chopped onion and the chopped garlic

00:01:14.630 --> 00:01:16.850
over a medium heat for five minutes

00:01:16.850 --> 00:01:18.110
(Good girl)

00:01:19.280 --> 00:01:21.540
Step Three

00:01:21.840 --> 00:01:23.040
Rinse the beans

00:01:23.040 --> 00:01:25.840
Right Archie you're going to pop those in. Nice and slowly

00:01:25.840 --> 00:01:27.560
And then add them to the pan

00:01:27.570 --> 00:01:29.470
Pour tin tomatoes

00:01:29.470 --> 00:01:32.180
(Ahh Arch! Brilliant)

00:01:32.180 --> 00:01:36.100
Tomato puree and chilli powder

00:01:36.880 --> 00:01:39.400
Here we go, sprinkle that in

00:01:39.400 --> 00:01:41.920
Brilliant, give it a good old stir

00:01:41.920 --> 00:01:44.660
Bring to the boil and simmer for twenty minutes

00:01:45.340 --> 00:01:47.060
Step Four

00:01:47.260 --> 00:01:49.100
(You take a big spoon then)

00:01:49.100 --> 00:01:51.460
Divide the mixture between the tortillas

00:01:51.740 --> 00:01:53.980
squidge it in the middle

00:01:53.980 --> 00:01:54.840
Good work

00:01:54.840 --> 00:01:59.520
Roll them up and put them joined down into a grease ovenproof dish

00:01:59.840 --> 00:02:01.680
Well done you

00:02:01.680 --> 00:02:04.460
When you put them all in top with grated cheese

00:02:04.460 --> 00:02:07.460
(Give it a sprinkle on this side, lovely)

00:02:07.460 --> 00:02:10.989
Then pop them into a pre-heated oven at 200 degrees

00:02:10.989 --> 00:02:13.469
for fifteen minutes

00:02:13.469 --> 00:02:15.769
Here we are guys (Ooh Yum)

00:02:15.769 --> 00:02:17.840
Super easy Enchiladas

00:02:17.840 --> 00:02:20.950
Who wants some sour cream? (Me) (Me Please) Splodge

00:02:20.950 --> 00:02:24.710
(Can we dig in?) Yeah go on then dig in tell me what you think

00:02:24.780 --> 00:02:28.200
How is it? (Um yum) Good (Yummy)

00:02:28.200 --> 00:02:31.080
Yeah, its too nice (laughter)

00:02:42.360 --> 00:02:42.390
ok
