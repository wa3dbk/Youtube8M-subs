00:00:06.930 --> 00:00:12.860
 Say pyramid mountain is in the deep of the mountains 

00:00:13.990 --> 00:00:19.950
 But it is here I will be a dark color to kill look to see this 

00:00:18.550 --> 00:00:21.660
 Ah ah ah ah 

00:00:19.950 --> 00:00:26.970
 Unexpected It is beautiful 

00:00:21.660 --> 00:00:29.720
 Just in addition this is uh this is called Sasayama 

00:00:26.970 --> 00:00:34.170
 It is a pyramid of rival Japan 

00:00:29.720 --> 00:00:40.790
 Showa This mountain was discovered to be a pyramid 

00:00:34.170 --> 00:00:47.990
 The most powerful grounds are the large ones among these megalithic remains 

00:00:40.790 --> 00:00:50.110
 This transfer was built by ancient people as an observatory to know the movement of the sun 

00:00:47.990 --> 00:00:50.110
 It is 

00:00:51.800 --> 00:01:01.879
 High in just the lamp Asia person of stone and I diagonal is connecting the stone 

00:00:56.360 --> 00:01:03.329
 It agrees with the north-south line . Another one is that this break shows something 

00:01:01.879 --> 00:01:05.230
 I wonder 

00:01:03.329 --> 00:01:08.490
 In example it is the break 

00:01:05.230 --> 00:01:10.760
 There is a gap of about 30 degrees, is n't it? 

00:01:08.490 --> 00:01:15.350
 It is the magnetic field of the earth new 

00:01:10.760 --> 00:01:21.230
 With the idea that there is a difference in the locality of the drum and it reflects it 

00:01:15.350 --> 00:01:27.740
 From there at the time to Ma want to do not a Krieger of the cast line is the decisive battle gold went to are of par 

00:01:21.230 --> 00:01:30.780
 It is perfect for 35 people, from tomorrow astronomers from that time to represent it with its practice and Ise 

00:01:27.740 --> 00:01:34.330
 I did it now or now 

00:01:30.780 --> 00:01:41.150
 It is that so-called geomagnetism that you say 

00:01:34.330 --> 00:01:47.630
 Although it is shown, it is also an age of so-called correspondence faith at that time, so that winter solstice solstice 

00:01:41.150 --> 00:01:54.620
 If you indicate by the line of the line, it is just that 202 million years , so the location where it was before 

00:01:47.630 --> 00:01:58.820
 Tsutsu entered new Well this is also probably did become another giraffe fair Kanze But I'm hypothesis 

00:01:54.620 --> 00:02:01.140
 Well this is another sound Shio 

00:01:58.820 --> 00:02:06.150
 Is it cut like this or 

00:02:01.140 --> 00:02:08.220
 Well this four have Well one big stone such Fu beautiful it is of rather than came 

00:02:06.150 --> 00:02:13.240
 I think I've cut it 

00:02:08.220 --> 00:02:18.010
 This is a Well now of technology and it is a another very large scale 

00:02:13.240 --> 00:02:24.880
 I think it is extremely difficult, but just looking at this 

00:02:18.010 --> 00:02:25.960
 I think of is now very similar to the rock work that can always Well precise So you something-in car 

00:02:24.880 --> 00:02:30.550
 Huh 

00:02:25.960 --> 00:02:35.560
 Though it is very difficult with current technology though 

00:02:30.550 --> 00:02:38.790
 Somewhat lost technology Roast technology was once 

00:02:35.560 --> 00:02:40.030
 Well if there is to Thai 

00:02:38.790 --> 00:02:43.450
 Now 

00:02:40.030 --> 00:02:47.200
 It 's like a laser beam in science, so to speak 

00:02:43.450 --> 00:02:52.920
 I do not know if it was a closed configuration or it was a laser beam though 

00:02:47.200 --> 00:02:54.690
 Like a laser beam or whether not you cut it 

00:02:52.920 --> 00:03:03.480
 Sakai Masaru 

00:02:54.690 --> 00:03:08.970
 Excavated and surveyed with confidence that the rice pyramid has been present in Japan since ancient times 

00:03:03.480 --> 00:03:12.570
 In his taiko Japanese pyramid he says: 

00:03:08.970 --> 00:03:18.810
 The pyramid is limited to Egypt 

00:03:12.570 --> 00:03:23.070
 One of the things that has been misunderstood to date as being limited to what is in Giza is in part 

00:03:18.810 --> 00:03:27.120
 The store was due in the most touching easy place to Manako 

00:03:23.070 --> 00:03:28.960
 Because it is a temple that asks for the correspondence with the Orchids Pyramid 

00:03:27.120 --> 00:03:36.190
 Yo than ever before Japan 

00:03:28.960 --> 00:03:41.260
 Oite great pyramids in Japan even without any doubt and I think that should should have the real masters in the 

00:03:36.190 --> 00:03:49.830
 Loud the world's big discoveries that exist 

00:03:41.260 --> 00:03:49.830
 That the upcoming given the freedom that can Sicko readers together with kana thank line to God! 

00:03:50.440 --> 00:03:59.670
 Sakai Katsumi is a god of pyramids at the summit of Mt. 

00:03:56.200 --> 00:03:59.670
 I found a corresponding seat 

00:04:02.050 --> 00:04:14.590
 Of course there is also an opinion that denies the existence of Japan's pyramid theory 

00:04:07.660 --> 00:04:21.120
 But these megaliths are apparently being expelled as if they were artificially combined 

00:04:14.590 --> 00:04:21.120
 Is too shaped to be called just casual 

00:04:22.770 --> 00:04:30.770
 Here is Dieï½° to the public was in Well great high do you a place becomes the spinal column 

00:04:27.780 --> 00:04:31.780
 Give me some black 

00:04:30.770 --> 00:04:34.500
 Bateshon 

00:04:31.780 --> 00:04:38.580
 Something Oh hey eh 

00:04:34.500 --> 00:04:45.700
 If you can get here, don't you have a problem? 

00:04:38.580 --> 00:04:50.740
 Uu Ua Aa' just ah ah It's it do over the that round ball maze 

00:04:45.700 --> 00:04:57.910
 So the hole that the sleeping soul was buried at night 

00:04:50.740 --> 00:04:59.080
 This Well I this stone pillar that is this is or little is under about height 4m 5m 

00:04:57.910 --> 00:05:01.390
 Though 

00:04:59.080 --> 00:05:08.190
 Well this is back then 

00:05:01.390 --> 00:05:08.190
 In the old days, it was called that 3 bottles had 4 languages. 

00:05:08.289 --> 00:05:16.960
 Dolmen in the ruins as a further feature 

00:05:12.680 --> 00:05:22.900
 In other words, there is an offering table where I went to my wife and my child 

00:05:16.960 --> 00:05:27.150
 British Stonehenge in small scale but flat stone on two stones 

00:05:22.900 --> 00:05:34.100
 It has exactly the same shape as 

00:05:27.150 --> 00:05:34.100
 In the primordial age, Emeishan might not have been a pyramid again
