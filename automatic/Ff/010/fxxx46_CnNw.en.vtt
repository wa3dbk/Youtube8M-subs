00:00:01.530 --> 00:00:05.189
 hello how about dear friends 

00:00:03.600 --> 00:00:07.229
 lacerda cristian duque of the page is 

00:00:05.189 --> 00:00:09.269
 frank alex dotcom and today I want 

00:00:07.229 --> 00:00:10.769
 read a very interesting letter before 

00:00:09.269 --> 00:00:13.740
 nothing I want to take a picture because 

00:00:10.769 --> 00:00:16.070
 to promote the video and I'm going to put it 

00:00:13.740 --> 00:00:16.070
 here 

00:00:17.920 --> 00:00:22.990
 first of all the letter writes to 

00:00:21.040 --> 00:00:24.760
 our friend alexander valdez hello 

00:00:22.990 --> 00:00:27.700
 cristian my name is alexis soy de peru 

00:00:24.760 --> 00:00:30.250
 I live in Los Angeles some time ago 

00:00:27.700 --> 00:00:32.590
 I've been watching your videos and following the 

00:00:30.250 --> 00:00:35.140
 Tips are fantastic thanks to the ex 

00:00:32.590 --> 00:00:36.699
 He wanted me to please explain 

00:00:35.140 --> 00:00:39.250
 what is the difference between a vaudeville 

00:00:36.699 --> 00:00:41.290
 of ruth bodybuilder a fernet add a 

00:00:39.250 --> 00:00:45.670
 physical model of the routine of 

00:00:41.290 --> 00:00:49.660
 exercises requests of Maria and in that 

00:00:45.670 --> 00:00:51.850
 thank you very much thank you very much 

00:00:49.660 --> 00:00:55.900
 good central is a very good question 

00:00:51.850 --> 00:00:58.790
 the physical model I would say that it is not 

00:00:55.900 --> 00:01:01.670
 as streaky as the number one bodybuilder 

00:00:58.790 --> 00:01:03.710
 number 2 the two use drugs do not you 

00:01:01.670 --> 00:01:05.330
 I'm going to hide our that I'm going to try 

00:01:03.710 --> 00:01:07.670
 to disappoint 

00:01:05.330 --> 00:01:09.920
 but the bodybuilder uses a lot more than 

00:01:07.670 --> 00:01:11.810
 the model of physical number 3 the model 

00:01:09.920 --> 00:01:14.210
 of physicist usually does not train with 

00:01:11.810 --> 00:01:16.340
 weights very heavy because for him in the 

00:01:14.210 --> 00:01:17.930
 size of the muscle mass does not 

00:01:16.340 --> 00:01:20.450
 the size is really important 

00:01:17.930 --> 00:01:23.240
 of the muscle mass that can take away 

00:01:20.450 --> 00:01:27.020
 work if the number is too large 

00:01:23.240 --> 00:01:29.030
 4 the nutrition is almost the same this is going 

00:01:27.020 --> 00:01:31.130
 to realize that what they eat bodybuilder 

00:01:29.030 --> 00:01:33.380
 what as a physical model even 

00:01:31.130 --> 00:01:35.210
 what a bikini athlete eats is not 

00:01:33.380 --> 00:01:38.360
 a girl in a thong and hold is 

00:01:35.210 --> 00:01:40.479
 practically the same thing what they do 

00:01:38.360 --> 00:01:43.759
 the difference is not so much nutrition 

00:01:40.479 --> 00:01:46.400
 but the training or if the 

00:01:43.759 --> 00:01:47.990
 person trains with high weight if the 

00:01:46.400 --> 00:01:50.630
 person trains with a lot of time 

00:01:47.990 --> 00:01:53.300
 rest the drugs the drugs are very 

00:01:50.630 --> 00:01:55.580
 important in distinguishing an athlete 

00:01:53.300 --> 00:01:58.790
 that would be a physical model or a 

00:01:55.580 --> 00:02:00.320
 bodybuilder also the diuretics in the 

00:01:58.790 --> 00:02:02.630
 bodybuilder uses an abundance of 

00:02:00.320 --> 00:02:06.320
 injectable and oral diuretics 

00:02:02.630 --> 00:02:08.390
 the physical model too but how much and 

00:02:06.320 --> 00:02:11.600
 what frequency is a big difference 

00:02:08.390 --> 00:02:15.720
 between both 

00:02:11.600 --> 00:02:18.540
 and another important thing to note is 

00:02:15.720 --> 00:02:20.220
 I would say the cardiovascular model of 

00:02:18.540 --> 00:02:23.220
 physical based on the abundance of 

00:02:20.220 --> 00:02:25.800
 cardiovascular runs walks towards 

00:02:23.220 --> 00:02:28.110
 many machines the bodybuilder does 

00:02:25.800 --> 00:02:30.150
 only cardiovascular to prepare 

00:02:28.110 --> 00:02:32.670
 for the scenario an issue that what 

00:02:30.150 --> 00:02:34.200
 make through the year the model of 

00:02:32.670 --> 00:02:36.450
 exercises also I think it's more 

00:02:34.200 --> 00:02:39.300
 flexible I think it takes more time to 

00:02:36.450 --> 00:02:41.340
 narrowing I think he works more with the 

00:02:39.300 --> 00:02:45.780
 sit-ups or the non-physical world 

00:02:41.340 --> 00:02:48.510
 has a simpler body because to 

00:02:45.780 --> 00:02:51.360
 your work has to look more like 

00:02:48.510 --> 00:02:53.250
 the man or the woman in the street just 

00:02:51.360 --> 00:02:55.140
 the bodybuilder is more concerned with 

00:02:53.250 --> 00:02:56.459
 look like a beast and that's the 

00:02:55.140 --> 00:02:58.380
 difference so I hope I have you 

00:02:56.459 --> 00:02:59.640
 liked this video if you like it 

00:02:58.380 --> 00:03:01.709

00:02:59.640 --> 00:03:02.250
