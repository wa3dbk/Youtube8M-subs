00:00:09.060 --> 00:00:13.830
 hello very good I'm kimchi throne and 

00:00:11.550 --> 00:00:15.570
 We are in a new video tutorial today 

00:00:13.830 --> 00:00:17.670
 let's talk about resin the 

00:00:15.570 --> 00:00:20.130
 rubber trees from the beginning until 

00:00:17.670 --> 00:00:23.160
 the end everything you need to do 

00:00:20.130 --> 00:00:25.619
 rubber cables and all those things for 

00:00:23.160 --> 00:00:27.270
 extract the rubber and here we have the 

00:00:25.619 --> 00:00:30.650
 señorito alberola who is working 

00:00:27.270 --> 00:00:30.650
 looking there away 

00:00:31.880 --> 00:00:37.760
 and good and now we go there to 

00:00:35.120 --> 00:00:39.110
 find these trees to see for 

00:00:37.760 --> 00:00:41.920
 find these trees you have to go to 

00:00:39.110 --> 00:00:44.300
 a marsh biome is worth 

00:00:41.920 --> 00:00:45.949
 because they are hard to find they are 

00:00:44.300 --> 00:00:47.420
 to the fifth pussy and when you see a swamp 

00:00:45.949 --> 00:00:50.300
 you say look here there will have to be a 

00:00:47.420 --> 00:00:52.070
 plan to the best there is but there may be 

00:00:50.300 --> 00:00:53.570
 very few these are normal trees not 

00:00:52.070 --> 00:00:56.149
 you get confused you have to be these 

00:00:53.570 --> 00:00:57.440
 very very dark wood and to know that 

00:00:56.149 --> 00:01:01.070
 they really are rubber has to have 

00:00:57.440 --> 00:01:03.339
 these stuff here see this tree 

00:01:01.070 --> 00:01:07.340
 rubber 

00:01:03.339 --> 00:01:11.659
 well this is a rubber tree because the 

00:01:07.340 --> 00:01:13.189
 resin resin good here that was 

00:01:11.659 --> 00:01:16.330
 building is still preparing the 

00:01:13.189 --> 00:01:20.670
 tutorial el señorito alberola 

00:01:16.330 --> 00:01:23.409
 this is another type of rubber tree but 

00:01:20.670 --> 00:01:25.840
 is found if the jungle is found 

00:01:23.409 --> 00:01:28.329
 this tree was found but we did not 

00:01:25.840 --> 00:01:29.740
 is needed or is not is not useful for 

00:01:28.329 --> 00:01:31.960
 this thing good as it has been said that 

00:01:29.740 --> 00:01:34.090
 here this is my part hello I'm going to 

00:01:31.960 --> 00:01:35.649
 talk about how these trees are planted 

00:01:34.090 --> 00:01:36.580
 how far we planted them and how 

00:01:35.649 --> 00:01:40.049
 take advantage of them 

00:01:36.580 --> 00:01:40.049
 we stand a distance of 

00:01:42.299 --> 00:01:45.299
 334 

00:01:46.810 --> 00:01:52.409
 you need this you spit it the tree 

00:01:48.909 --> 00:01:52.409
 when you remove all the foliage 

00:01:53.280 --> 00:01:57.390
 the plant is to wipe out what I found 

00:01:55.890 --> 00:01:58.890
 is the swamp raze with all over 

00:01:57.390 --> 00:02:00.830
 everything is a multiplayer serve so what 

00:01:58.890 --> 00:02:04.770
 who is coming 

00:02:00.830 --> 00:02:07.110
 well then on the internet servers 

00:02:04.770 --> 00:02:09.450
 is very accurate rats as you will see and 

00:02:07.110 --> 00:02:12.420
 play with us then using with 

00:02:09.450 --> 00:02:14.489
 a thousand of trees grow surprise then 

00:02:12.420 --> 00:02:15.530
 here what you are going to do is explain everything 

00:02:14.489 --> 00:02:18.989
 the foliage 

00:02:15.530 --> 00:02:20.550
 in order to find this that are the 

00:02:18.989 --> 00:02:22.260
 points from which the resin is removed 

00:02:20.550 --> 00:02:24.300
 because there are some trees that 

00:02:22.260 --> 00:02:29.580
 some of those do not normally have 

00:02:24.300 --> 00:02:32.640
 they have two then while in the cellar of 

00:02:29.580 --> 00:02:34.890
 explain it these are four factors 

00:02:32.640 --> 00:02:37.950
 that I think we already explained the other 

00:02:34.890 --> 00:02:39.569
 positive time for 50 how are the 

00:02:37.950 --> 00:02:41.250
 resins you can cut the tree but 

00:02:39.569 --> 00:02:43.380
 as it is not practical since it costs a 

00:02:41.250 --> 00:02:46.170
 heap against the tree here in the 

00:02:43.380 --> 00:02:49.140
 kraft table eo if you do this way 

00:02:46.170 --> 00:02:52.860
 With wood , a titan is a son of 

00:02:49.140 --> 00:02:54.390
 trees this can be removed this serves 

00:02:52.860 --> 00:02:56.100
 to remove the resin two trees but 

00:02:54.390 --> 00:02:57.630
 it is used quite then it is a roll 

00:02:56.100 --> 00:02:58.890
 have to do several then why 

00:02:57.630 --> 00:03:00.630
 it's worth it 

00:02:58.890 --> 00:03:01.920
 electric three tap that is one of 

00:03:00.630 --> 00:03:03.840
 electric that can be recharged in 

00:03:01.920 --> 00:03:06.390
 any place very comfortable a crystal 

00:03:03.840 --> 00:03:08.280
 normal an electrical circuit and a 

00:03:06.390 --> 00:03:11.780
 battery that you already have to know 

00:03:08.280 --> 00:03:11.780
 do it well 

00:03:12.260 --> 00:03:18.290
 please so well with your 30 then 

00:03:16.069 --> 00:03:22.430
 come here to the point and right click 

00:03:18.290 --> 00:03:26.299
 and spit resin come spit resin 

00:03:22.430 --> 00:03:27.819
 Estevez spit one before two and almost 32 

00:03:26.299 --> 00:03:30.890
 good 

00:03:27.819 --> 00:03:34.920
 12 well you are 

00:03:30.890 --> 00:03:38.010
 then you can also cut the tree 

00:03:34.920 --> 00:03:41.310
 as well as creative good if 

00:03:38.010 --> 00:03:42.720
 you get spit on this this wood and 

00:03:41.310 --> 00:03:44.640
 the other tree that was planted here 

00:03:42.720 --> 00:03:47.489
 that we have already cut gives us this that 

00:03:44.640 --> 00:03:50.030
 it seems like a breast way 

00:03:47.489 --> 00:03:52.350
 brick or if you come to an extractor 

00:03:50.030 --> 00:03:54.660
 with the wood of the tree that gives you 

00:03:52.350 --> 00:03:56.910
 resins and you put it you see that you start 

00:03:54.660 --> 00:04:00.780
 to go up now we will see if you put the other 

00:03:56.910 --> 00:04:02.340
 you also need a tablet and for the 

00:04:00.780 --> 00:04:06.900
 cable, as we explained, rubber is needed 

00:04:02.340 --> 00:04:10.140
 the rubber has to pass the resin through 

00:04:06.900 --> 00:04:12.060
 an oven then when you find the 

00:04:10.140 --> 00:04:15.209
 trees in the swamp do not cut yourselves 

00:04:12.060 --> 00:04:17.729
 you all make an attempt to cut the 

00:04:15.209 --> 00:04:18.299
 foliage will come out buds you take the 

00:04:17.729 --> 00:04:19.739
 resin 

00:04:18.299 --> 00:04:22.889
 you can already make rubber and you count the 

00:04:19.739 --> 00:04:26.700
 trees to extract more gum then 

00:04:22.889 --> 00:04:29.400
 in an oven if you put the resin 

00:04:26.700 --> 00:04:32.640
 the resin will give you one rubber for each 

00:04:29.400 --> 00:04:35.790
 one of resin uses the just because because 

00:04:32.640 --> 00:04:38.670
 Once you can do the wiring and a 

00:04:35.790 --> 00:04:41.520
 extractor for each resin that 

00:04:38.670 --> 00:04:42.960
 do you spit on three rubber so 

00:04:41.520 --> 00:04:44.730
 which clear triples the production is 

00:04:42.960 --> 00:04:46.020
 one adda animal is as stocker is 

00:04:44.730 --> 00:04:48.590
 very important that you see and everyone else 

00:04:46.020 --> 00:04:51.330
 tutorials to present I do not take off 

00:04:48.590 --> 00:04:53.200
 to understand everything because if not 

00:04:51.330 --> 00:04:55.540
 we are explaining for nothing 

00:04:53.200 --> 00:04:57.550
 one of resin I call three rubber 

00:04:55.540 --> 00:05:00.160
 subscribe to my channel llosa liked 

00:04:57.550 --> 00:05:01.990
 I like it and I hope that I have 

00:05:00.160 --> 00:05:06.150
 liked and helped a little this video 

00:05:01.990 --> 00:05:06.150
 tutorial and greetings to everyone
