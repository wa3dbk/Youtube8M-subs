00:00:25.780 --> 00:00:25.790 
is trippy is it surprising that the

00:00:25.790 --> 00:00:28.179 
is trippy is it surprising that the
doctors<00:00:26.149> would<00:00:26.270> allow<00:00:26.570> him<00:00:27.349> to<00:00:27.380> film<00:00:27.739> it<00:00:27.860> no<00:00:28.160> I

think<00:00:28.489> it's<00:00:28.730> great<00:00:28.910> a<00:00:29.029> little<00:00:29.360> bit<00:00:29.540> but<00:00:29.869> again

00:00:30.369 --> 00:00:30.379 
think it's great a little bit but again

00:00:30.379 --> 00:00:33.400 
think it's great a little bit but again
it's<00:00:30.890> almost<00:00:31.550> 2014<00:00:32.509> and<00:00:32.719> everything's

00:00:33.400 --> 00:00:33.410 
it's almost 2014 and everything's

00:00:33.410 --> 00:00:35.950 
it's almost 2014 and everything's
internet<00:00:34.010> why<00:00:34.309> wouldn't<00:00:35.180> the<00:00:35.270> doctors<00:00:35.750> want

00:00:35.950 --> 00:00:35.960 
internet why wouldn't the doctors want

00:00:35.960 --> 00:00:38.470 
internet why wouldn't the doctors want
to<00:00:36.050> be<00:00:36.320> quiet<00:00:37.070> and<00:00:37.460> private<00:00:37.969> I'd<00:00:38.149> be<00:00:38.300> afraid

00:00:38.470 --> 00:00:38.480 
to be quiet and private I'd be afraid

00:00:38.480 --> 00:00:40.569 
to be quiet and private I'd be afraid
they'd<00:00:38.719> be<00:00:38.840> distracted<00:00:39.530> I<00:00:39.680> wanted<00:00:40.129> to<00:00:40.250> focus

00:00:40.569 --> 00:00:40.579 
they'd be distracted I wanted to focus

00:00:40.579 --> 00:00:42.639 
they'd be distracted I wanted to focus
on<00:00:40.879> my<00:00:40.940> brother<00:00:41.329> what<00:00:42.170> do<00:00:42.230> you<00:00:42.320> think<00:00:42.559> about

00:00:42.639 --> 00:00:42.649 
on my brother what do you think about

00:00:42.649 --> 00:00:44.380 
on my brother what do you think about
the<00:00:42.859> fact<00:00:43.070> that<00:00:43.249> they<00:00:43.519> have<00:00:43.699> been<00:00:43.879> documenting

00:00:44.380 --> 00:00:44.390 
the fact that they have been documenting

00:00:44.390 --> 00:00:46.299 
the fact that they have been documenting
their<00:00:44.690> life<00:00:44.870> every<00:00:45.320> single<00:00:45.499> day<00:00:45.800> for<00:00:45.859> so<00:00:46.190> many

00:00:46.299 --> 00:00:46.309 
their life every single day for so many

00:00:46.309 --> 00:00:49.569 
their life every single day for so many
years<00:00:46.699> I<00:00:46.940> don't<00:00:47.629> think<00:00:48.019> that's<00:00:48.350> necessary<00:00:49.249> I

00:00:49.569 --> 00:00:49.579 
years I don't think that's necessary I

00:00:49.579 --> 00:00:53.410 
years I don't think that's necessary I
think<00:00:49.909> it<00:00:49.999> would<00:00:50.179> be<00:00:50.390> very<00:00:51.170> troublesome<00:00:51.679> a<00:00:52.609> lot

00:00:53.410 --> 00:00:53.420 
think it would be very troublesome a lot

00:00:53.420 --> 00:00:55.299 
think it would be very troublesome a lot
of<00:00:53.539> other<00:00:53.629> things<00:00:53.989> to<00:00:54.199> do<00:00:54.350> it's<00:00:54.679> surprising

00:00:55.299 --> 00:00:55.309 
of other things to do it's surprising

00:00:55.309 --> 00:00:58.569 
of other things to do it's surprising
that<00:00:55.539> someone<00:00:56.539> would<00:00:56.899> like<00:00:57.800> Laura<00:00:58.129> that<00:00:58.370> veil

00:00:58.569 --> 00:00:58.579 
that someone would like Laura that veil

00:00:58.579 --> 00:01:00.879 
that someone would like Laura that veil
of<00:00:58.760> privacy<00:00:59.329> and<00:00:59.420> say<00:00:59.659> here's<00:00:59.960> my<00:01:00.019> life<00:01:00.379> you
