00:02:30.610 --> 00:02:30.620 
together and then on the odd chance I

00:02:30.620 --> 00:02:32.980 
together and then on the odd chance I
remember<00:02:30.890> I<00:02:30.950> left<00:02:31.190> it<00:02:31.400> on<00:02:31.490> overnight<00:02:31.940> I<00:02:32.270> take

00:02:40.730 --> 00:02:43.540 
deal because in theory I should be
taking<00:02:41.030> it<00:02:41.090> off<00:02:41.210> in<00:02:41.330> it<00:02:41.420> anyways<00:02:41.800> but<00:02:42.800> that<00:02:43.400> was

00:02:43.540 --> 00:02:43.550 
taking it off in it anyways but that was

00:02:43.550 --> 00:02:46.810 
taking it off in it anyways but that was
just<00:02:43.580> really<00:02:43.850> I<00:02:44.270> don't<00:02:45.230> know<00:02:45.400> so<00:02:46.400> I<00:02:46.430> am<00:02:46.670> going

00:02:46.810 --> 00:02:46.820 
just really I don't know so I am going

00:02:46.820 --> 00:02:49.320 
just really I don't know so I am going
to<00:02:46.910> keep<00:02:47.060> using<00:02:47.959> this<00:02:48.290> for<00:02:48.590> a<00:02:48.620> little<00:02:48.770> while

00:02:49.320 --> 00:02:49.330 
to keep using this for a little while

00:02:49.330 --> 00:02:51.699 
to keep using this for a little while
see<00:02:50.330> if<00:02:50.360> it<00:02:50.570> grows<00:02:50.690> on<00:02:50.870> me<00:02:51.110> see<00:02:51.380> if<00:02:51.440> I<00:02:51.500> get<00:02:51.560> used

00:02:51.699 --> 00:02:51.709 
see if it grows on me see if I get used

00:02:51.709 --> 00:02:53.380 
see if it grows on me see if I get used
to<00:02:51.860> it<00:02:51.980> but<00:02:52.250> I<00:02:52.430> have<00:02:52.610> a<00:02:52.640> feeling<00:02:52.820> that<00:02:53.060> I'm<00:02:53.240> just

00:02:53.380 --> 00:02:53.390 
to it but I have a feeling that I'm just

00:02:53.390 --> 00:02:55.600 
to it but I have a feeling that I'm just
gonna<00:02:53.480> get<00:02:53.690> sick<00:02:53.900> of<00:02:54.020> this<00:02:54.140> I<00:02:54.490> remember<00:02:55.490> it

00:02:55.600 --> 00:02:55.610 
gonna get sick of this I remember it

00:02:55.610 --> 00:03:02.250 
gonna get sick of this I remember it
smelling<00:02:55.730> butt<00:02:56.180> oh<00:02:56.980> yeah<00:02:57.980> there<00:02:59.950> it<00:03:00.950> stinks<00:03:01.400> in

00:03:02.250 --> 00:03:02.260 
smelling butt oh yeah there it stinks in

00:03:02.260 --> 00:03:04.660 
smelling butt oh yeah there it stinks in
my<00:03:03.260> opinion<00:03:03.500> that<00:03:03.650> smells<00:03:03.890> like<00:03:03.980> yeast<00:03:04.280> which

00:03:04.660 --> 00:03:04.670 
my opinion that smells like yeast which

00:03:04.670 --> 00:03:07.540 
my opinion that smells like yeast which
is<00:03:04.880> probably<00:03:05.239> really<00:03:06.140> really<00:03:06.530> bad<00:03:07.070> like<00:03:07.100> I

00:03:07.540 --> 00:03:07.550 
is probably really really bad like I

00:03:07.550 --> 00:03:08.650 
is probably really really bad like I
wouldn't<00:03:07.730> even<00:03:07.820> want<00:03:08.030> to<00:03:08.120> stick<00:03:08.270> this<00:03:08.390> near<00:03:08.570> my

00:03:11.770 --> 00:03:11.780 
eye now that i think about it because it

00:03:11.780 --> 00:03:14.770

flake<00:04:43.939> or<00:04:44.120> anything<00:04:44.479> and<00:04:44.719> it's<00:04:45.289> actually

00:04:45.399 --> 00:04:45.409 
flake or anything and it's actually

00:04:45.409 --> 00:04:47.050

really<00:04:45.740> easy<00:04:45.860> to<00:04:46.099> get<00:04:46.189> off<00:04:46.340> because<00:04:46.819> it<00:04:46.849> like

00:04:47.050 --> 00:04:47.060 
really easy to get off because it like

00:04:47.060 --> 00:04:48.969 
really easy to get off because it like
comes<00:04:47.330> off<00:04:47.479> and<00:04:47.629> like<00:04:47.780> little<00:04:47.990> wormy<00:04:48.409> black

00:04:48.969 --> 00:04:48.979

they<00:04:49.400> look<00:04:49.610> really<00:04:49.789> gross<00:04:49.969> we<00:04:50.150> take<00:04:50.360> it<00:04:50.449> off

00:04:50.559 --> 00:04:50.569 
they look really gross we take it off

00:04:50.569 --> 00:04:52.990 
they look really gross we take it off
but<00:04:50.750> it<00:04:50.810> comes<00:04:50.960> off<00:04:51.050> really<00:04:51.169> easily<00:04:51.610> so<00:04:52.610> I'm

00:04:52.990 --> 00:04:53.000 
but it comes off really easily so I'm

00:04:53.000 --> 00:04:54.459 
but it comes off really easily so I'm
sure<00:04:53.180> like<00:04:53.389> there's<00:04:53.810> some<00:04:53.990> people<00:04:54.139> that<00:04:54.289> might

00:04:54.459 --> 00:04:54.469 
sure like there's some people that might

00:04:54.469 --> 00:04:56.980 
sure like there's some people that might
like<00:04:54.770> it<00:04:55.180> personally<00:04:56.180> I<00:04:56.210> just<00:04:56.360> I<00:04:56.599> find<00:04:56.840> that

00:04:58.749 --> 00:04:58.759 
it's too much of a hassle to get on and

00:04:58.759 --> 00:05:00.879 
it's too much of a hassle to get on and
