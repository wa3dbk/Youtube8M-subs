stalkers so dark shines is getting think

00:00:49.260 --> 00:00:52.279 
stalkers so dark shines is getting think
better<00:00:49.530> and<00:00:49.829> move<00:00:50.489> back<00:00:50.730> here<00:00:51.000> so<00:00:51.239> these<00:00:52.020> point

00:00:52.279 --> 00:00:52.289 
better and move back here so these point

00:00:52.289 --> 00:00:53.720 
better and move back here so these point
defense<00:00:52.559> drones<00:00:52.829> from<00:00:52.949> the<00:00:53.100> Raven<00:00:53.340> really<00:00:53.550> did

00:00:53.720 --> 00:00:53.730 
defense drones from the Raven really did

00:00:53.730 --> 00:00:55.910 
defense drones from the Raven really did
shine<00:00:54.390> pretty<00:00:54.719> well<00:00:54.899> there<00:00:55.140> this<00:00:55.680> point

00:00:55.910 --> 00:00:55.920 
shine pretty well there this point

00:00:55.920 --> 00:00:57.380 
shine pretty well there this point
defense<00:00:56.160> drone<00:00:56.250> in<00:00:56.489> particular<00:00:56.969> was<00:00:57.090> down<00:00:57.270> to

00:00:57.380 --> 00:00:57.390 
defense drone in particular was down to

00:00:57.390 --> 00:00:59.389 
defense drone in particular was down to
zero<00:00:57.600> energy<00:00:57.840> so<00:00:58.199> it<00:00:58.230> did<00:00:58.410> soak<00:00:58.710> up<00:00:58.829> a<00:00:59.010> lot<00:00:59.039> of

00:00:59.389 --> 00:00:59.399 
zero energy so it did soak up a lot of

00:00:59.399 --> 00:01:01.459 
zero energy so it did soak up a lot of
shots<00:00:59.609> back<00:01:00.329> over<00:01:00.570> Huck<00:01:00.780> space<00:01:01.050> looks<00:01:01.350> like

00:01:01.459 --> 00:01:01.469 
shots back over Huck space looks like

00:01:01.469 --> 00:01:03.470 
shots back over Huck space looks like
he's<00:01:01.620> dropping<00:01:02.010> more<00:01:02.520> gateways<00:01:02.820> all<00:01:03.180> the<00:01:03.300> time

00:01:03.470 --> 00:01:03.480 
he's dropping more gateways all the time

00:01:03.480 --> 00:01:05.810 
he's dropping more gateways all the time
three<00:01:03.750> more<00:01:04.110> gateways<00:01:04.379> no<00:01:05.220> more<00:01:05.430> robotics

00:01:05.810 --> 00:01:05.820

00:01:24.869 --> 00:01:26.450 
see what he can do however he does think
the<00:01:24.930> better<00:01:25.080> of<00:01:25.259> it<00:01:25.350> as<00:01:25.500> well<00:01:25.740> and<00:01:25.950> heads<00:01:26.250> on

00:01:26.450 --> 00:01:26.460 
the better of it as well and heads on

00:01:26.460 --> 00:01:28.969 
the better of it as well and heads on
home<00:01:26.759> his<00:01:27.450> Huck<00:01:27.750> expanding<00:01:28.290> yes<00:01:28.439> he<00:01:28.560> is<00:01:28.710> over

00:01:28.969 --> 00:01:28.979 
home his Huck expanding yes he is over

00:01:28.979 --> 00:01:31.340 
home his Huck expanding yes he is over
at<00:01:29.100> his<00:01:29.280> natural<00:01:29.790> natural<00:01:30.000> so<00:01:30.540> his<00:01:30.750> taking<00:01:31.200> his

00:01:31.340 --> 00:01:31.350 
at his natural natural so his taking his

00:01:31.350 --> 00:01:33.770 
at his natural natural so his taking his

so<00:01:38.820> Huck<00:01:39.390> is<00:01:39.630> gonna<00:01:39.960> try<00:01:40.259> and<00:01:40.409> make<00:01:40.680> sure<00:01:40.829> that

00:01:40.969 --> 00:01:40.979 
so Huck is gonna try and make sure that

00:01:40.979 --> 00:01:44.030 
so Huck is gonna try and make sure that
no<00:01:41.430> cloaking<00:01:41.970> banshees<00:01:42.680> mess<00:01:43.680> with<00:01:43.890> his

it<00:01:52.049> now<00:01:52.490> so<00:01:53.490> Huck<00:01:53.880> pretty<00:01:54.299> much<00:01:54.420> just<00:01:54.630> taking

00:01:54.950 --> 00:01:54.960 
it now so Huck pretty much just taking

00:01:54.960 --> 00:01:56.840 
it now so Huck pretty much just taking
some<00:01:55.079> time<00:01:55.290> to<00:01:55.320> sit<00:01:55.560> back<00:01:55.590> in<00:01:55.860> macro<00:01:56.369> build<00:01:56.700> up

00:01:56.840 --> 00:01:56.850

00:02:01.100 --> 00:02:01.110 
switched him over to warp gates yet it's

00:02:01.110 --> 00:02:03.469 
switched him over to warp gates yet it's
kind<00:02:01.259> of<00:02:01.290> interesting<00:02:01.909> not<00:02:02.909> sure<00:02:03.060> what<00:02:03.299> he's

00:02:03.469 --> 00:02:03.479 
kind of interesting not sure what he's

the<00:02:21.580> bio-balls<00:02:22.170> can't<00:02:23.170> do<00:02:23.290> anything<00:02:23.530> about<00:02:23.740> it

00:02:23.880 --> 00:02:23.890 
the bio-balls can't do anything about it

00:02:23.890 --> 00:02:27.540 
the bio-balls can't do anything about it
and<00:02:25.290> did<00:02:26.290> a<00:02:26.320> point<00:02:26.650> defense<00:02:26.890> drone<00:02:26.980> go<00:02:27.250> down<00:02:27.520> I

00:02:27.540 --> 00:02:27.550 
and did a point defense drone go down I

00:02:27.550 --> 00:02:29.700 
and did a point defense drone go down I
didn't<00:02:28.030> see<00:02:28.240> it<00:02:28.270> but<00:02:28.510> it<00:02:28.660> looks<00:02:28.990> like<00:02:29.110> that<00:02:29.410> oh

00:02:29.700 --> 00:02:29.710 
didn't see it but it looks like that oh

00:02:29.710 --> 00:02:31.680 
didn't see it but it looks like that oh
there<00:02:30.160> it<00:02:30.250> is<00:02:30.370> there<00:02:30.550> it<00:02:30.580> is<00:02:30.730> and<00:02:30.880> it<00:02:31.330> did<00:02:31.480> soak

00:02:31.680 --> 00:02:31.690 
there it is there it is and it did soak

00:02:31.690 --> 00:02:33.060 
there it is there it is and it did soak
up<00:02:31.810> all<00:02:31.990> those<00:02:32.230> shots<00:02:32.470> from<00:02:32.620> the<00:02:32.680> stalkers

00:02:33.060 --> 00:02:33.070 
up all those shots from the stalkers

00:02:33.070 --> 00:02:34.410 
up all those shots from the stalkers
again<00:02:33.400> so<00:02:33.640> dark<00:02:33.880> shine<00:02:34.060> is<00:02:34.150> getting<00:02:34.330> the

again so dark shine is getting the

00:02:34.420 --> 00:02:36.810 
again so dark shine is getting the
benefit<00:02:34.870> huge<00:02:35.260> benefit<00:02:35.680> out<00:02:35.800> of<00:02:35.830> that<00:02:36.040> point

like<00:02:55.030> another<00:02:55.240> Colossus<00:02:55.690> is<00:02:55.810> up<00:02:56.020> he's<00:02:56.230> going

00:02:56.370 --> 00:02:56.380 
like another Colossus is up he's going

00:02:56.380 --> 00:02:57.660 
like another Colossus is up he's going
to<00:02:56.440> want<00:02:56.560> those<00:02:56.770> Vikings<00:02:57.160> over<00:02:57.370> there<00:02:57.490> however

00:02:57.660 --> 00:02:57.670 
to want those Vikings over there however

00:02:57.670 --> 00:02:59.550 
to want those Vikings over there however
he's<00:02:57.970> killing<00:02:58.300> off<00:02:58.390> drones<00:02:58.690> at<00:02:59.140> the<00:02:59.290> moment

00:02:59.550 --> 00:02:59.560 
he's killing off drones at the moment

00:02:59.560 --> 00:03:01.770 
he's killing off drones at the moment
these<00:02:59.620> banshees<00:03:00.070> probably<00:03:00.459> want<00:03:01.180> to<00:03:01.240> well

00:03:01.770 --> 00:03:01.780 
these banshees probably want to well

00:03:01.780 --> 00:03:02.790 
these banshees probably want to well
looks<00:03:01.959> like<00:03:02.020> they're<00:03:02.200> going<00:03:02.350> to<00:03:02.410> take<00:03:02.560> out<00:03:02.680> the

00:03:02.790 --> 00:03:02.800 
looks like they're going to take out the

00:03:02.800 --> 00:03:04.710 
looks like they're going to take out the
only<00:03:03.010> anti-air<00:03:03.370> that<00:03:03.610> hukka<00:03:03.790> has<00:03:04.030> in<00:03:04.300> position

00:03:04.710 --> 00:03:04.720 
only anti-air that hukka has in position

00:03:04.720 --> 00:03:05.730 
only anti-air that hukka has in position
and<00:03:04.900> then<00:03:05.020> they're<00:03:05.170> probably<00:03:05.200> going<00:03:05.500> to<00:03:05.590> start

00:03:05.730 --> 00:03:05.740 
and then they're probably going to start

00:03:05.740 --> 00:03:08.010 
and then they're probably going to start
working<00:03:05.830> on<00:03:06.130> the<00:03:06.760> Colossus<00:03:07.450> these<00:03:07.630> Vikings

00:03:08.010 --> 00:03:08.020 
working on the Colossus these Vikings

00:03:08.020 --> 00:03:09.240 
working on the Colossus these Vikings

00:03:14.709 --> 00:03:16.320 
medevacs backing off banshees did they
escape<00:03:15.070> where'd<00:03:15.400> they<00:03:15.459> go<00:03:15.580> now<00:03:15.880> they<00:03:16.030> flew<00:03:16.180> off

ok<00:03:18.430> and<00:03:18.670> the<00:03:18.790> Vikings<00:03:19.150> still<00:03:19.480> killing<00:03:20.070> probes

00:03:21.060 --> 00:03:21.070 
ok and the Vikings still killing probes

00:03:21.070 --> 00:03:23.009 
ok and the Vikings still killing probes
back<00:03:21.280> here<00:03:21.489> and<00:03:21.670> hug<00:03:22.209> finally<00:03:22.570> moving<00:03:22.810> in<00:03:22.900> with

00:03:23.009 --> 00:03:23.019 
back here and hug finally moving in with

00:03:23.019 --> 00:03:24.540 
back here and hug finally moving in with
his<00:03:23.110> Colossus<00:03:23.500> able<00:03:23.709> to<00:03:23.800> kill<00:03:23.920> one<00:03:24.130> Viking

his Colossus able to kill one Viking
looks<00:03:24.940> like<00:03:25.090> dark<00:03:25.300> shrines<00:03:25.510> is<00:03:25.690> just<00:03:25.959> going<00:03:26.080> to

00:03:26.130 --> 00:03:26.140 
looks like dark shrines is just going to

00:03:26.140 --> 00:03:28.170 
looks like dark shrines is just going to
leave<00:03:26.350> these<00:03:26.580> forgot<00:03:27.580> all<00:03:27.700> about<00:03:27.790> it<00:03:27.970> most

00:03:28.170 --> 00:03:28.180 
leave these forgot all about it most

00:03:28.180 --> 00:03:29.729 
leave these forgot all about it most
likely<00:03:28.300> but<00:03:28.660> they<00:03:28.810> did<00:03:29.050> their<00:03:29.290> work<00:03:29.320> they

00:03:29.729 --> 00:03:29.739

killed off all those workers here at hug

00:03:31.570 --> 00:03:33.990
