end of the day the way it came across

00:01:42.630 --> 00:01:45.319 
end of the day the way it came across
was<00:01:43.280> offending<00:01:44.280> to<00:01:44.399> a<00:01:44.460> lot<00:01:44.610> of<00:01:44.640> people<00:01:44.790> and<00:01:45.270> it

00:01:45.319 --> 00:01:45.329 
was offending to a lot of people and it

00:01:45.329 --> 00:01:47.090 
was offending to a lot of people and it
wasn't<00:01:45.600> appropriate<00:01:45.810> and<00:01:46.259> of<00:01:46.320> course<00:01:46.560> Tom

00:01:47.090 --> 00:01:47.100 
wasn't appropriate and of course Tom

00:01:47.100 --> 00:01:49.130 
wasn't appropriate and of course Tom
seems<00:01:47.399> to<00:01:47.549> agree<00:01:47.729> without<00:01:47.970> big<00:01:48.630> mindful<00:01:49.049> of

00:01:49.130 --> 00:01:49.140 
seems to agree without big mindful of

00:01:49.140 --> 00:01:52.069 
seems to agree without big mindful of
the<00:01:49.320> steps<00:01:49.920> that<00:01:50.009> they<00:01:50.250> took<00:01:50.460> but<00:01:51.119> I<00:01:51.149> think<00:01:51.540> the

00:01:52.069 --> 00:01:52.079 
the steps that they took but I think the

00:01:52.079 --> 00:01:54.109 
the steps that they took but I think the
issue<00:01:52.290> has<00:01:52.560> been<00:01:52.740> made<00:01:52.950> bigger<00:01:53.399> in<00:01:53.610> some<00:01:53.909> ways

00:01:54.109 --> 00:01:54.119 
issue has been made bigger in some ways

00:01:54.119 --> 00:01:56.270 
issue has been made bigger in some ways
by<00:01:54.479> them<00:01:54.840> not<00:01:55.110> doing<00:01:55.619> the<00:01:55.710> right<00:01:55.740> thing<00:01:56.159> in<00:01:56.250> the

00:01:56.270 --> 00:01:56.280 
by them not doing the right thing in the

00:01:56.280 --> 00:01:59.120 
by them not doing the right thing in the
right<00:01:56.369> order<00:01:56.729> if<00:01:57.299> there<00:01:57.570> was<00:01:57.689> an<00:01:57.810> apology<00:01:58.380> very

00:01:59.120 --> 00:01:59.130 
right order if there was an apology very

00:01:59.130 --> 00:02:01.069 
right order if there was an apology very
quickly<00:01:59.430> and<00:01:59.729> it<00:01:59.850> was<00:01:59.969> on<00:02:00.180> air<00:02:00.479> I<00:02:00.719> think<00:02:00.960> this

00:02:01.069 --> 00:02:01.079 
quickly and it was on air I think this

00:02:01.079 --> 00:02:02.389 
quickly and it was on air I think this
whole<00:02:01.200> thing<00:02:01.259> would<00:02:01.560> be<00:02:01.680> behind<00:02:01.950> us<00:02:02.040> by<00:02:02.219> now<00:02:02.340> i

00:02:02.389 --> 00:02:02.399 
whole thing would be behind us by now i

00:02:02.399 --> 00:02:04.039 
whole thing would be behind us by now i
agree<00:02:02.610> with<00:02:02.790> you<00:02:02.909> i<00:02:03.149> think<00:02:03.540> that<00:02:03.659> that's<00:02:03.780> the

00:02:04.039 --> 00:02:04.049 
agree with you i think that that's the

00:02:04.049 --> 00:02:05.179 
agree with you i think that that's the
way<00:02:04.140> it<00:02:04.259> should<00:02:04.290> have<00:02:04.500> gone<00:02:04.530> down<00:02:04.829> treated

00:02:05.179 --> 00:02:05.189 
way it should have gone down treated

00:02:05.189 --> 00:02:06.920 
way it should have gone down treated
it's<00:02:05.280> funny<00:02:05.490> you're<00:02:06.060> not<00:02:06.299> a<00:02:06.540> hundred<00:02:06.780> percent

00:02:06.920 --> 00:02:06.930 
it's funny you're not a hundred percent

00:02:06.930 --> 00:02:08.540 
it's funny you're not a hundred percent
happy<00:02:07.530> because<00:02:07.829> they<00:02:08.009> didn't<00:02:08.250> issue<00:02:08.310> the

00:02:08.540 --> 00:02:08.550 
happy because they didn't issue the

00:02:08.550 --> 00:02:10.580 
happy because they didn't issue the
apology<00:02:09.060> I'm<00:02:09.479> not<00:02:09.750> a<00:02:09.810> hundred<00:02:10.020> percent<00:02:10.140> happy

00:02:10.580 --> 00:02:10.590 
apology I'm not a hundred percent happy

00:02:10.590 --> 00:02:11.660 
apology I'm not a hundred percent happy
because<00:02:10.739> I<00:02:10.860> think<00:02:11.039> they<00:02:11.129> mistreated<00:02:11.580> the

00:02:11.660 --> 00:02:11.670 
because I think they mistreated the

00:02:11.670 --> 00:02:13.260 
because I think they mistreated the
announcers<00:02:12.090> and<00:02:12.120> like<00:02:12.450> you<00:02:12.599> say<00:02:12.780> until

00:02:13.260 --> 00:02:13.270 
announcers and like you say until

00:02:13.270 --> 00:02:14.850 
announcers and like you say until
they<00:02:13.360> issue<00:02:13.840> the<00:02:13.960> apology<00:02:14.410> the<00:02:14.530> thing<00:02:14.680> won't

00:02:14.850 --> 00:02:14.860 
they issue the apology the thing won't

00:02:14.860 --> 00:02:17.430 
they issue the apology the thing won't
go<00:02:15.010> away<00:02:15.130> so<00:02:16.060> I<00:02:16.090> mean<00:02:16.570> I'm<00:02:16.720> with<00:02:17.050> you<00:02:17.170> that<00:02:17.320> they

00:02:17.430 --> 00:02:17.440 
go away so I mean I'm with you that they

00:02:17.440 --> 00:02:18.990 
go away so I mean I'm with you that they
should<00:02:17.830> do<00:02:17.920> it<00:02:18.010> on<00:02:18.130> air<00:02:18.310> and<00:02:18.400> my<00:02:18.520> guess<00:02:18.730> is<00:02:18.880> they

00:02:18.990 --> 00:02:19.000 
should do it on air and my guess is they

00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:20.310 
should do it on air and my guess is they
will<00:02:19.090> do<00:02:19.210> it<00:02:19.330> tonight<00:02:19.450> Trita<00:02:19.870> I<00:02:19.930> know<00:02:20.050> you're

00:04:22.740 --> 00:04:22.750 
it's not just at a certain race they do

00:04:22.750 --> 00:04:24.140 
it's not just at a certain race they do
it<00:04:22.990> it's<00:04:23.140> sort<00:04:23.410> of<00:04:23.500> across<00:04:23.710> the

00:04:24.140 --> 00:04:24.150 
it it's sort of across the

00:04:24.150 --> 00:04:25.760 
it it's sort of across the
board<00:04:24.270> that<00:04:24.449> that<00:04:24.750> was<00:04:24.870> sort<00:04:25.110> of<00:04:25.169> my<00:04:25.229> my

00:04:25.760 --> 00:04:25.770 
board that that was sort of my my

00:04:25.770 --> 00:04:28.580 
board that that was sort of my my
question<00:04:26.580> to<00:04:26.820> agree<00:04:27.300> to<00:04:27.330> that<00:04:27.630> it's<00:04:28.199> sort<00:04:28.440> of

00:04:28.580 --> 00:04:28.590 
question to agree to that it's sort of

00:04:28.590 --> 00:04:31.580 
question to agree to that it's sort of
part<00:04:29.009> of<00:04:29.340> not<00:04:30.080> justifying<00:04:31.080> what<00:04:31.229> they<00:04:31.380> said

00:04:31.580 --> 00:04:31.590 
part of not justifying what they said

00:04:31.590 --> 00:04:33.920 
part of not justifying what they said
because<00:04:31.740> we<00:04:32.040> both<00:04:32.190> agree<00:04:32.550> it<00:04:32.820> went<00:04:33.539> too<00:04:33.690> far

00:04:33.920 --> 00:04:33.930 
because we both agree it went too far

00:04:33.930 --> 00:04:35.360 
because we both agree it went too far
and<00:04:33.990> I'm<00:04:34.199> sure<00:04:34.380> they<00:04:34.530> would<00:04:34.680> love<00:04:34.830> to<00:04:35.039> take<00:04:35.220> it

00:04:35.360 --> 00:04:35.370 
and I'm sure they would love to take it

00:04:35.370 --> 00:04:38.180 
and I'm sure they would love to take it
back<00:04:35.550> but<00:04:35.940> the<00:04:36.930> response<00:04:37.320> i<00:04:37.680> don't<00:04:37.830> think<00:04:38.009> by
