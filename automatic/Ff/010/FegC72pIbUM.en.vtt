have<00:00:26.699> a<00:00:26.760> look<00:00:27.029> at<00:00:27.150> the<00:00:27.240> floor<00:00:27.510> plan<00:00:27.539> which<00:00:27.990> we

00:00:28.160 --> 00:00:28.170 
have a look at the floor plan which we

00:00:28.170 --> 00:00:32.500 
have a look at the floor plan which we
draw<00:00:28.470> in<00:00:28.680> this<00:00:28.830> video<00:00:30.230> it's<00:00:31.230> not<00:00:31.500> a<00:00:31.710> very<00:00:32.070> easy

00:00:44.330 --> 00:00:44.340 
and different wall thicknesses but I'll

00:00:44.340 --> 00:00:47.150 
and different wall thicknesses but I'll
show<00:00:44.760> how<00:00:45.210> you<00:00:45.930> can<00:00:46.170> do<00:00:46.320> this<00:00:46.469> more<00:00:46.920> quickly

00:00:47.150 --> 00:00:47.160 
show how you can do this more quickly

show how you can do this more quickly
and<00:00:47.640> more<00:00:47.789> easily<00:00:47.850> using<00:00:48.660> a<00:00:48.780> background<00:00:49.020> image

00:00:49.430 --> 00:00:49.440 
and more easily using a background image

00:00:49.440 --> 00:00:52.549 
and more easily using a background image
we'll<00:00:50.340> do<00:00:50.489> it<00:00:50.610> step-by-step<00:00:50.879> let's<00:00:51.840> first<00:00:52.260> go

00:02:25.600 --> 00:02:27.560 
pop-up menu and press ok and then you
see<00:02:25.840> that<00:02:25.870> the<00:02:26.110> drawing<00:02:26.410> will<00:02:26.680> change<00:02:27.220> scale

00:02:27.560 --> 00:02:27.570 
see that the drawing will change scale

00:02:27.570 --> 00:02:29.790 
see that the drawing will change scale
now<00:02:28.570> it's<00:02:28.750> time<00:02:28.990> to<00:02:29.020> consider<00:02:29.560> the

00:02:29.790 --> 00:02:29.800 
now it's time to consider the

00:02:29.800 --> 00:02:32.190 
now it's time to consider the
orientation<00:02:30.610> of<00:02:30.700> our<00:02:30.910> floor<00:02:31.480> plan<00:02:31.720> you<00:02:32.050> must

00:02:32.190 --> 00:02:32.200 
orientation of our floor plan you must

00:02:32.200 --> 00:02:35.520 
orientation of our floor plan you must
look<00:02:32.410> a<00:02:32.530> bit<00:02:32.650> ahead<00:02:32.770> now<00:02:33.570> because<00:02:34.570> it's<00:02:34.990> easier

00:02:35.520 --> 00:02:35.530 
look a bit ahead now because it's easier

00:02:35.530 --> 00:02:37.590 
look a bit ahead now because it's easier
to<00:02:35.710> draw<00:02:35.980> rooms<00:02:36.340> with<00:02:36.610> horizontal<00:02:37.390> and

00:02:37.590 --> 00:02:37.600 
to draw rooms with horizontal and

00:02:37.600 --> 00:02:39.980 
to draw rooms with horizontal and
vertical<00:02:38.020> walls<00:02:38.260> you<00:02:38.830> should<00:02:39.010> take<00:02:39.250> a

00:02:39.980 --> 00:02:39.990 
vertical walls you should take a

00:02:39.990 --> 00:02:43.140 
vertical walls you should take a
rotation<00:02:40.990> where<00:02:41.230> your<00:02:41.650> amount<00:02:41.950> of<00:02:42.250> walls<00:02:42.610> in

00:02:43.140 --> 00:02:43.150 
rotation where your amount of walls in

00:02:43.150 --> 00:02:48.360 
rotation where your amount of walls in
an<00:02:43.510> angle<00:02:43.959> like<00:02:44.440> these<00:02:45.300> are<00:02:46.300> minimized<00:02:47.130> but<00:02:48.130> if

00:02:48.360 --> 00:02:48.370 
an angle like these are minimized but if

00:02:48.370 --> 00:02:51.000 
an angle like these are minimized but if
we<00:02:48.520> look<00:02:48.730> closely<00:02:49.090> to<00:02:49.570> this<00:02:49.900> plan<00:02:50.260> then<00:02:50.590> you

00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:51.010 
we look closely to this plan then you

00:02:51.010 --> 00:02:54.030 
we look closely to this plan then you
see<00:02:51.280> that<00:02:51.430> most<00:02:51.700> of<00:02:51.940> the<00:02:52.180> walls<00:02:53.110> are<00:02:53.440> are

00:02:54.030 --> 00:02:54.040 
see that most of the walls are are

00:02:54.040 --> 00:02:58.170 
see that most of the walls are are
actually<00:02:54.480> horizontal<00:02:55.480> and<00:02:56.550> vertical<00:02:57.550> so

00:02:58.170 --> 00:02:58.180 
actually horizontal and vertical so

00:02:58.180 --> 00:02:58.830 
actually horizontal and vertical so
that's<00:02:58.390> good

00:02:58.830 --> 00:02:58.840 
that's good

00:02:58.840 --> 00:03:01.320 
that's good
another<00:02:59.740> thing<00:03:00.040> to<00:03:00.190> consider<00:03:00.340> is<00:03:00.910> that<00:03:01.180> your

00:03:01.320 --> 00:03:01.330 
another thing to consider is that your

00:03:01.330 --> 00:03:03.540 
another thing to consider is that your
plan<00:03:01.540> usually<00:03:02.080> looks<00:03:02.290> bigger<00:03:02.620> and<00:03:02.770> better<00:03:03.190> on

00:03:03.540 --> 00:03:03.550 
plan usually looks bigger and better on

00:03:03.550 --> 00:03:07.220 
plan usually looks bigger and better on
a<00:03:03.580> screen<00:03:04.090> in<00:03:04.330> a<00:03:04.420> horizontal<00:03:05.110> orientation<00:03:05.730> so

00:03:07.220 --> 00:03:07.230 
a screen in a horizontal orientation so

00:03:07.230 --> 00:03:10.730 
a screen in a horizontal orientation so
let's<00:03:08.230> rotate<00:03:08.590> this<00:03:09.100> plan<00:03:09.540> 19<00:03:10.540> degrees

00:03:10.730 --> 00:03:10.740 
let's rotate this plan 19 degrees

00:03:10.740 --> 00:03:15.210 
let's rotate this plan 19 degrees
counterclockwise<00:03:11.880> so<00:03:12.880> I'm<00:03:13.209> typing<00:03:13.720> minus<00:03:14.709> 90

00:03:15.210 --> 00:03:15.220 
counterclockwise so I'm typing minus 90

00:03:15.220 --> 00:03:19.770 
counterclockwise so I'm typing minus 90
and<00:03:15.959> this<00:03:16.959> is<00:03:17.140> what<00:03:17.350> I<00:03:17.380> want<00:03:17.940> in<00:03:18.940> this<00:03:19.120> menu<00:03:19.420> you

00:03:19.770 --> 00:03:19.780 
and this is what I want in this menu you

00:03:19.780 --> 00:03:24.210 
and this is what I want in this menu you
can<00:03:20.080> also<00:03:20.200> change<00:03:20.680> the<00:03:20.860> transparency<00:03:23.160> but<00:03:24.160> I

00:03:24.210 --> 00:03:24.220 
can also change the transparency but I

00:03:24.220 --> 00:03:28.350 
can also change the transparency but I
like<00:03:24.519> it<00:03:24.700> on<00:03:24.790> 50<00:03:25.680> you<00:03:26.680> can<00:03:26.950> show<00:03:27.489> or<00:03:27.820> hide<00:03:27.850> the

00:03:28.350 --> 00:03:28.360 
like it on 50 you can show or hide the

00:03:28.360 --> 00:03:31.620 
like it on 50 you can show or hide the
drawing<00:03:29.250> position<00:03:30.250> it<00:03:30.370> at<00:03:30.580> the<00:03:30.940> bottom<00:03:31.120> or<00:03:31.480> on

00:03:31.620 --> 00:03:31.630 
drawing position it at the bottom or on

00:03:31.630 --> 00:03:34.650 
drawing position it at the bottom or on
top<00:03:31.900> of<00:03:31.959> your<00:03:32.590> drawing<00:03:32.950> and<00:03:33.250> if<00:03:33.940> you<00:03:34.450> want<00:03:34.600> to

00:03:34.650 --> 00:03:34.660 
top of your drawing and if you want to

00:03:34.660 --> 00:03:36.960 
top of your drawing and if you want to
get<00:03:34.810> rid<00:03:34.989> of<00:03:35.019> it<00:03:35.230> you<00:03:35.260> can<00:03:35.560> delete<00:03:35.830> it<00:03:35.860> here<00:03:36.220> but

00:03:36.960 --> 00:03:36.970 
get rid of it you can delete it here but

00:03:36.970 --> 00:03:40.460 
get rid of it you can delete it here but
we're<00:03:37.150> done<00:03:37.300> and<00:03:37.510> I'm<00:03:38.110> pressing<00:03:38.620> save<00:03:38.980> and

00:03:40.460 --> 00:03:40.470 
we're done and I'm pressing save and

00:03:40.470 --> 00:03:42.690 
we're done and I'm pressing save and

00:03:51.479 --> 00:03:51.489 
project for a floor plan uploaded a

00:03:51.489 --> 00:03:54.660 
project for a floor plan uploaded a
drawing<00:03:51.880> and<00:03:52.180> scale<00:03:53.140> and<00:03:53.350> rotated<00:03:53.980> it<00:03:54.190> and<00:03:54.459> now

00:03:54.660 --> 00:03:54.670 
drawing and scale and rotated it and now

00:03:54.670 --> 00:03:56.340 
drawing and scale and rotated it and now
we're<00:03:54.850> ready<00:03:55.060> to<00:03:55.330> start<00:03:55.570> tracing<00:03:55.870> the<00:03:56.170> walls

00:03:56.340 --> 00:03:56.350 
we're ready to start tracing the walls

00:03:56.350 --> 00:03:58.650 
we're ready to start tracing the walls
in<00:03:57.070> the<00:03:57.220> next<00:03:57.459> part<00:03:57.700> we'll<00:03:58.030> tackle<00:03:58.330> some

00:03:58.650 --> 00:03:58.660 
in the next part we'll tackle some

00:03:58.660 --> 00:04:01.080 
in the next part we'll tackle some
