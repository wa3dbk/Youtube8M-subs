00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.870
 and have you ever heard that the 

00:00:01.589 --> 00:00:06.060
 human insulin required by numerous 

00:00:03.870 --> 00:00:08.580
 people in the world can come from 

00:00:06.060 --> 00:00:11.250
 a good cow this is possible thanks to 

00:00:08.580 --> 00:00:13.410
 biotechnology in Argentina - sectors 

00:00:11.250 --> 00:00:15.179
 how agriculture and health look 

00:00:13.410 --> 00:00:18.090
 benefited by the development of this 

00:00:15.179 --> 00:00:19.800
 scientific branch let's see bio sidus is 

00:00:18.090 --> 00:00:21.180
 an Argentine biotechnology company 

00:00:19.800 --> 00:00:22.890
 that develops projects of 

00:00:21.180 --> 00:00:24.810
 research and production of animals 

00:00:22.890 --> 00:00:27.529
 transgenic to obtain proteins 

00:00:24.810 --> 00:00:30.390
 human recombinants for therapeutic use 

00:00:27.529 --> 00:00:34.020
 in recent years it is being noticed as 

00:00:30.390 --> 00:00:37.530
 that we already have the support of a context 

00:00:34.020 --> 00:00:40.530
 political in which biotechnology 

00:00:37.530 --> 00:00:41.940
 is detected as an aspect of 

00:00:40.530 --> 00:00:43.890
 development inside in a way 

00:00:41.940 --> 00:00:45.930
 important in the country 

00:00:43.890 --> 00:00:48.329
 in this way in ways and two we can 

00:00:45.930 --> 00:00:50.399
 develop platforms like that of 

00:00:48.329 --> 00:00:52.230
 transgenic animals one of the 

00:00:50.399 --> 00:00:53.699
 developed platforms is about 

00:00:52.230 --> 00:00:55.559
 a cow that has an insulin gene 

00:00:53.699 --> 00:00:57.960
 human , which allows us to produce 

00:00:55.559 --> 00:01:00.480
 protein for this necessary a process 

00:00:57.960 --> 00:01:02.460
 very specific and peculiar 

00:01:00.480 --> 00:01:04.229
 the human insulin project is 

00:01:02.460 --> 00:01:06.240
 also generate transgenic animals 

00:01:04.229 --> 00:01:10.800
 they produce insulin in their milk 

00:01:06.240 --> 00:01:12.869
 human and obtain large amounts of 

00:01:10.800 --> 00:01:15.300
 insulin from cow's milk 

00:01:12.869 --> 00:01:19.530
 to use as medication to omar 

00:01:15.300 --> 00:01:20.910
 to treat diabetes use is the use 

00:01:19.530 --> 00:01:23.250
 of the medication is the same as that given 

00:01:20.910 --> 00:01:27.060
 currently excluding 

00:01:23.250 --> 00:01:29.280
 the goal is to produce a form 

00:01:27.060 --> 00:01:30.930
 more economic the efforts are 

00:01:29.280 --> 00:01:32.910
 focused and perfect them in turn 

00:01:30.930 --> 00:01:34.650
 involved in both the renewal of 

00:01:32.910 --> 00:01:37.740
 animals how to achieve human insulin 

00:01:34.650 --> 00:01:40.979
 that is extracted from the milk of the cow to 

00:01:37.740 --> 00:01:43.100
 from which to extract the inheritance from 

00:01:40.979 --> 00:01:46.100
 animal there is a whole process of 

00:01:43.100 --> 00:01:46.100
 toning 

00:01:46.300 --> 00:01:51.880
 there is every other area of ​​the laboratory that 

00:01:48.760 --> 00:01:54.220
 is going to take care of extracting milk 

00:01:51.880 --> 00:01:57.550
 that protein and purify it by a series 

00:01:54.220 --> 00:02:00.100
 of steps to have the protein is pure 

00:01:57.550 --> 00:02:02.650
 and be able to generate from there a 

00:02:00.100 --> 00:02:04.600
 injectable drug industry 

00:02:02.650 --> 00:02:06.250
 pharmaceutical industry constitutes a field of 

00:02:04.600 --> 00:02:08.560
 very important biotechnology in 

00:02:06.250 --> 00:02:10.780
 Argentina in which a long 

00:02:08.560 --> 00:02:13.510
 tradition of biomedical research and 

00:02:10.780 --> 00:02:14.140
 an active national industry edgardo
