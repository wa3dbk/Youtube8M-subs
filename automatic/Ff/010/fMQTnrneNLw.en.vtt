00:00:49.250 --> 00:00:49.260 
really shows how easy a nuclear can be

you guys if you don't have scam John
Locke<00:00:52.920> and<00:00:53.100> you're<00:00:53.190> going<00:00:53.399> for<00:00:53.610> in<00:00:53.789> nuclear

00:00:54.139 --> 00:00:54.149 
Locke and you're going for in nuclear

00:00:54.149 --> 00:00:55.400 
Locke and you're going for in nuclear
maybe<00:00:54.329> if<00:00:54.449> you're<00:00:54.570> still<00:00:54.719> ranking<00:00:55.079> up<00:00:55.170> or<00:00:55.350> if

00:00:55.400 --> 00:00:55.410 
maybe if you're still ranking up or if

00:00:55.410 --> 00:00:56.750 
maybe if you're still ranking up or if
you<00:00:55.500> reset<00:00:55.800> your<00:00:55.860> stats<00:00:56.160> something<00:00:56.460> like<00:00:56.579> that

00:00:56.750 --> 00:00:56.760 
you reset your stats something like that

00:00:56.760 --> 00:00:58.790 
you reset your stats something like that
I<00:00:56.969> would<00:00:57.300> highly<00:00:57.600> suggest<00:00:57.660> throwing<00:00:58.350> on<00:00:58.559> fast

00:00:58.790 --> 00:00:58.800 
I would highly suggest throwing on fast

00:00:58.800 --> 00:01:01.099 
I would highly suggest throwing on fast
hands<00:00:59.039> obviously<00:00:59.910> you<00:01:00.030> can<00:01:00.329> get<00:01:00.660> in<00:01:00.780> nuclear

00:01:01.099 --> 00:01:01.109 
hands obviously you can get in nuclear

00:01:01.109 --> 00:01:02.840 
hands obviously you can get in nuclear
without<00:01:01.379> scavenger<00:01:01.949> or<00:01:01.980> fast<00:01:02.370> hands<00:01:02.579> but<00:01:02.789> I

00:01:02.840 --> 00:01:02.850 
without scavenger or fast hands but I

00:01:02.850 --> 00:01:04.130 
without scavenger or fast hands but I
usually<00:01:03.149> like<00:01:03.270> to<00:01:03.420> run<00:01:03.570> at<00:01:03.690> least<00:01:03.780> one<00:01:04.019> of

00:01:04.130 --> 00:01:04.140 
usually like to run at least one of

00:01:04.140 --> 00:01:05.539 
usually like to run at least one of
those<00:01:04.290> now<00:01:04.619> moving<00:01:04.830> on<00:01:05.040> what's<00:01:05.220> really<00:01:05.430> good

00:01:05.539 --> 00:01:05.549 
those now moving on what's really good

00:01:05.549 --> 00:01:06.800 
those now moving on what's really good
about<00:01:05.580> hard<00:01:05.939> point<00:01:06.150> is<00:01:06.270> that<00:01:06.390> you<00:01:06.479> can<00:01:06.630> build

00:01:06.800 --> 00:01:06.810 
about hard point is that you can build

00:01:06.810 --> 00:01:08.330 
about hard point is that you can build
up<00:01:06.900> scorestreaks<00:01:07.380> very<00:01:07.650> fast<00:01:07.950> probably

00:01:08.330 --> 00:01:08.340 
up scorestreaks very fast probably

00:01:08.340 --> 00:01:10.850 
up scorestreaks very fast probably
faster<00:01:08.790> than<00:01:08.970> any<00:01:09.270> other<00:01:09.540> game<00:01:09.840> type<00:01:10.080> and<00:01:10.290> much

00:01:10.850 --> 00:01:10.860 
faster than any other game type and much

00:01:10.860 --> 00:01:12.260 
faster than any other game type and much
like<00:01:11.040> Kill<00:01:11.220> Confirmed<00:01:11.250> you<00:01:11.729> can<00:01:11.850> actually<00:01:12.090> lay

00:01:12.260 --> 00:01:12.270 
like Kill Confirmed you can actually lay

00:01:12.270 --> 00:01:13.789 
like Kill Confirmed you can actually lay
off<00:01:12.479> the<00:01:12.689> hardpoint<00:01:13.110> as<00:01:13.350> you<00:01:13.470> would<00:01:13.619> quote

00:01:13.789 --> 00:01:13.799 
off the hardpoint as you would quote

00:01:13.799 --> 00:01:15.230 
off the hardpoint as you would quote
unquote<00:01:13.950> lay<00:01:14.310> off<00:01:14.460> the<00:01:14.610> tags<00:01:14.850> and<00:01:15.119> kill

unquote lay off the tags and kill

00:01:15.240 --> 00:01:16.820

like to seek out the enemies rather than

00:02:01.740 --> 00:02:03.200 
like to seek out the enemies rather than
sitting<00:02:02.009> in<00:02:02.159> the<00:02:02.250> hardpoint<00:02:02.610> you<00:02:02.790> waiting<00:02:03.060> for

00:02:03.200 --> 00:02:03.210 
sitting in the hardpoint you waiting for

sitting in the hardpoint you waiting for
them<00:02:03.329> to<00:02:03.360> come<00:02:03.600> to<00:02:03.750> me<00:02:03.899> especially<00:02:04.439> when<00:02:04.710> there

00:02:07.170 --> 00:02:08.630 
is av set up keeping that in mind I also
like<00:02:07.439> to<00:02:07.469> utilize<00:02:07.680> the<00:02:08.129> technique<00:02:08.489> of

00:02:08.630 --> 00:02:08.640 
like to utilize the technique of

00:02:08.640 --> 00:02:10.460 
like to utilize the technique of
juggling<00:02:09.149> the<00:02:09.300> hardpoint<00:02:09.750> if<00:02:09.989> you're<00:02:10.379> not

00:02:10.460 --> 00:02:10.470 
juggling the hardpoint if you're not

00:02:10.470 --> 00:02:11.690 
juggling the hardpoint if you're not
familiar<00:02:10.590> with<00:02:11.039> this<00:02:11.129> technique<00:02:11.489> it's

00:02:11.690 --> 00:02:11.700 
familiar with this technique it's

00:02:11.700 --> 00:02:12.900 
familiar with this technique it's
basically<00:02:12.090> capturing<00:02:12.599> the<00:02:12.660> heart

00:02:12.900 --> 00:02:12.910 
basically capturing the heart

00:02:12.910 --> 00:02:14.490 
basically capturing the heart
point<00:02:13.120> getting<00:02:13.270> that<00:02:13.450> 200<00:02:13.870> point<00:02:14.020> bonus<00:02:14.200> for

00:02:14.490 --> 00:02:14.500 
point getting that 200 point bonus for

00:02:14.500 --> 00:02:16.020 
point getting that 200 point bonus for
capturing<00:02:14.800> a<00:02:14.920> hard<00:02:15.070> point<00:02:15.220> then<00:02:15.730> you<00:02:15.850> get<00:02:16.000> off

00:02:16.020 --> 00:02:16.030 
capturing a hard point then you get off

00:02:16.030 --> 00:02:18.360 
capturing a hard point then you get off
the<00:02:16.240> hardpoint<00:02:16.570> wait<00:02:16.780> for<00:02:16.960> the<00:02:17.020> enemy<00:02:17.170> to<00:02:17.370> go

00:02:18.360 --> 00:02:18.370 
the hardpoint wait for the enemy to go

00:02:18.370 --> 00:02:19.860 
the hardpoint wait for the enemy to go
into<00:02:18.700> the<00:02:18.790> hardpoint<00:02:19.120> before<00:02:19.450> killing<00:02:19.660> him

00:02:19.860 --> 00:02:19.870 
into the hardpoint before killing him

00:02:19.870 --> 00:02:21.480 
into the hardpoint before killing him
and<00:02:20.020> recapturing<00:02:20.530> the<00:02:20.620> hard<00:02:20.800> points<00:02:21.100> this

00:02:21.480 --> 00:02:21.490 
and recapturing the hard points this

00:02:21.490 --> 00:02:23.460 
and recapturing the hard points this
will<00:02:21.640> give<00:02:21.760> you<00:02:21.910> 500<00:02:22.450> 25<00:02:22.690> points<00:02:23.110> for<00:02:23.140> just<00:02:23.380> the

game play now getting score streaks in a
hard<00:02:37.570> point<00:02:37.750> can<00:02:38.050> actually<00:02:38.410> win<00:02:38.590> you<00:02:38.710> the

hard point can actually win you the

match so even though you might lose a

match so even though you might lose a
few<00:02:40.510> seconds<00:02:40.930> by<00:02:41.020> utilizing<00:02:41.530> this<00:02:41.650> technique

00:02:42.090 --> 00:02:42.100 
few seconds by utilizing this technique

00:02:42.100 --> 00:02:43.710 
few seconds by utilizing this technique
of<00:02:42.250> juggling<00:02:42.610> the<00:02:42.760> hardpoint<00:02:43.090> you<00:02:43.600> will

00:02:43.710 --> 00:02:43.720 
of juggling the hardpoint you will

00:02:43.720 --> 00:02:45.300 
of juggling the hardpoint you will
easily<00:02:43.900> be<00:02:44.110> able<00:02:44.230> to<00:02:44.440> take<00:02:44.710> control<00:02:45.010> of<00:02:45.100> the

enough lead so you can focus on getting
kills<00:02:48.880> and<00:02:49.180> working<00:02:49.510> on<00:02:49.630> that<00:02:49.750> nuclear<00:02:50.170> streak

kills and working on that nuclear streak

00:02:50.530 --> 00:02:52.440 
kills and working on that nuclear streak
rather<00:02:50.830> than<00:02:51.010> worrying<00:02:51.310> about<00:02:51.550> rotating<00:02:52.120> and

00:02:52.440 --> 00:02:52.450 
rather than worrying about rotating and

00:02:52.450 --> 00:02:54.390 
rather than worrying about rotating and
defending<00:02:52.930> the<00:02:53.020> hardpoint<00:02:53.440> another<00:02:54.130> thing

defending the hardpoint another thing
that<00:02:54.550> I<00:02:54.580> like<00:02:54.850> about<00:02:54.880> hard<00:02:55.360> point<00:02:55.600> is<00:02:55.690> you

00:02:55.800 --> 00:02:55.810 
that I like about hard point is you

00:02:55.810 --> 00:02:57.300 
that I like about hard point is you

this game I was playing with just one

00:03:01.180 --> 00:03:02.670 
this game I was playing with just one
person<00:03:01.360> and<00:03:01.720> we<00:03:01.780> had<00:03:01.900> no<00:03:01.930> problem<00:03:02.380> getting<00:03:02.500> a
