00:03:27.780 --> 00:03:30.740 
the most defensive um approach to them
and<00:03:27.989> it<00:03:28.470> was<00:03:28.590> only<00:03:28.709> two<00:03:28.980> volts<00:03:29.310> panama<00:03:30.180> their

00:03:30.740 --> 00:03:30.750 
and it was only two volts panama their

00:03:30.750 --> 00:03:32.839 
and it was only two volts panama their
peoples<00:03:31.169> they<00:03:31.530> are<00:03:31.709> they're<00:03:32.040> gonna<00:03:32.220> go<00:03:32.459> hard

00:03:32.839 --> 00:03:32.849 
peoples they are they're gonna go hard

00:03:32.849 --> 00:03:35.750 
peoples they are they're gonna go hard
in<00:03:33.090> every<00:03:33.510> tackle<00:03:33.750> uh<00:03:34.019> I<00:03:34.829> think<00:03:34.919> treating<00:03:35.639> eyes

00:03:35.750 --> 00:03:35.760 
in every tackle uh I think treating eyes

00:03:35.760 --> 00:03:37.699 
in every tackle uh I think treating eyes
when<00:03:35.970> I<00:03:36.000> have<00:03:36.180> a<00:03:36.209> tough<00:03:36.510> time<00:03:36.540> because<00:03:36.900> their

00:03:37.699 --> 00:03:37.709 
when I have a tough time because their

00:03:37.709 --> 00:03:39.170 
when I have a tough time because their
game<00:03:37.919> is<00:03:38.069> not<00:03:38.160> just<00:03:38.549> it's<00:03:38.730> not<00:03:38.760> gonna<00:03:38.910> be<00:03:39.060> as

00:03:39.170 --> 00:03:39.180 
game is not just it's not gonna be as

00:03:39.180 --> 00:03:41.479 
game is not just it's not gonna be as
fluent<00:03:39.569> so<00:03:40.049> I<00:03:40.079> think<00:03:40.500> that's<00:03:40.769> recent<00:03:41.069> Panama

00:03:41.479 --> 00:03:41.489 
fluent so I think that's recent Panama

00:03:41.489 --> 00:03:43.670 
fluent so I think that's recent Panama
is<00:03:41.639> being<00:03:41.910> favored<00:03:42.269> here<00:03:42.660> and<00:03:42.810> at<00:03:43.109> the<00:03:43.440> end<00:03:43.590> of

00:03:43.670 --> 00:03:43.680 
is being favored here and at the end of

00:03:43.680 --> 00:03:45.110 
is being favored here and at the end of
the<00:03:43.739> 90<00:03:43.949> minutes<00:03:44.250> I'll<00:03:44.340> be<00:03:44.669> honest<00:03:44.879> with<00:03:44.940> you<00:03:45.090> I

00:03:45.110 --> 00:03:45.120 
the 90 minutes I'll be honest with you I

00:03:45.120 --> 00:03:46.309 
the 90 minutes I'll be honest with you I
don't<00:03:45.239> even<00:03:45.389> think<00:03:45.510> that<00:03:45.810> they're<00:03:45.959> gonna<00:03:46.079> be<00:03:46.290> a

00:03:46.309 --> 00:03:46.319 
don't even think that they're gonna be a

00:03:46.319 --> 00:03:47.809 
don't even think that they're gonna be a
winner<00:03:46.590> the<00:03:46.889> 19<00:03:47.129> minutes<00:03:47.280> I<00:03:47.430> think<00:03:47.639> this<00:03:47.699> is

00:03:47.809 --> 00:03:47.819 
winner the 19 minutes I think this is

00:03:47.819 --> 00:03:49.729 
winner the 19 minutes I think this is
gonna<00:03:47.910> be<00:03:48.060> a<00:03:48.090> draw<00:03:48.389> 90<00:03:48.750> minutes<00:03:49.019> and<00:03:49.410> then<00:03:49.590> this

00:03:49.729 --> 00:03:49.739 
gonna be a draw 90 minutes and then this

00:03:49.739 --> 00:03:51.530 
gonna be a draw 90 minutes and then this
is<00:03:49.859> gonna<00:03:49.980> go<00:03:50.160> to<00:03:50.220> extra<00:03:50.609> time<00:03:50.790> I<00:03:51.030> think<00:03:51.480> an

00:03:51.530 --> 00:03:51.540 
is gonna go to extra time I think an

00:03:51.540 --> 00:03:53.509 
is gonna go to extra time I think an
extra<00:03:51.780> time<00:03:51.989> or<00:03:52.199> in<00:03:52.410> penalties<00:03:52.859> I<00:03:53.099> think

00:03:53.509 --> 00:03:53.519 
extra time or in penalties I think

00:03:53.519 --> 00:03:55.339 
extra time or in penalties I think
panama<00:03:53.819> has<00:03:54.000> the<00:03:54.150> edge<00:03:54.269> and<00:03:54.480> I<00:03:54.780> think<00:03:55.019> Panama's

00:03:55.339 --> 00:03:55.349 
panama has the edge and I think Panama's

00:03:55.349 --> 00:03:56.780 
panama has the edge and I think Panama's
gonna<00:03:55.470> make<00:03:55.650> it<00:03:55.739> to<00:03:55.799> a<00:03:55.829> next<00:03:56.069> time<00:03:56.160> alright

00:03:56.780 --> 00:03:56.790 
gonna make it to a next time alright

00:03:56.790 --> 00:03:58.280 
gonna make it to a next time alright

conceded<00:04:04.139> five<00:04:04.560> so<00:04:05.310> do<00:04:05.459> you<00:04:05.519> expect<00:04:06.000> goals

00:04:06.229 --> 00:04:06.239 
conceded five so do you expect goals

00:04:06.239 --> 00:04:08.330 
conceded five so do you expect goals
from<00:04:06.480> both<00:04:06.780> sides<00:04:07.169> in<00:04:07.440> this<00:04:07.560> match<00:04:07.799> both<00:04:08.099> teams

00:04:08.330 --> 00:04:08.340 
from both sides in this match both teams

00:04:08.340 --> 00:04:11.390 
from both sides in this match both teams
two<00:04:08.489> scores<00:04:08.760> 2.3<00:04:09.480> I<00:04:09.720> do<00:04:10.169> i<00:04:10.530> do<00:04:10.859> expect<00:04:11.160> that

00:04:11.390 --> 00:04:11.400 
two scores 2.3 I do i do expect that

00:04:11.400 --> 00:04:13.580 
two scores 2.3 I do i do expect that
goes<00:04:11.849> from<00:04:12.060> from<00:04:12.480> both<00:04:12.660> and<00:04:12.930> the<00:04:13.169> reason<00:04:13.440> why

00:04:13.580 --> 00:04:13.590 
goes from from both and the reason why

00:04:13.590 --> 00:04:16.729 
goes from from both and the reason why
is<00:04:13.620> because<00:04:13.819> Drina<00:04:14.819> and<00:04:14.970> Tuvalu<00:04:15.199> big<00:04:16.199> play<00:04:16.470> in

00:04:16.729 --> 00:04:16.739 
is because Drina and Tuvalu big play in

00:04:16.739 --> 00:04:18.860 
is because Drina and Tuvalu big play in
open<00:04:17.400> football<00:04:17.760> so<00:04:18.209> when<00:04:18.359> you<00:04:18.419> play<00:04:18.599> open

00:04:18.860 --> 00:04:18.870 
open football so when you play open

00:04:18.870 --> 00:04:20.659 
open football so when you play open
football<00:04:19.199> you're<00:04:19.349> gonna<00:04:19.470> leave<00:04:19.650> spaces<00:04:19.949> so

00:04:20.659 --> 00:04:20.669 
football you're gonna leave spaces so

00:04:20.669 --> 00:04:22.670 
football you're gonna leave spaces so
spaces<00:04:21.239> if<00:04:21.419> if<00:04:21.690> the<00:04:21.750> forwards<00:04:22.440> in<00:04:22.590> the

00:04:22.670 --> 00:04:22.680 
spaces if if the forwards in the

00:04:22.680 --> 00:04:24.589 
spaces if if the forwards in the
midfield<00:04:22.890> from<00:04:23.400> Panama<00:04:23.849> are<00:04:24.030> able<00:04:24.479> to

00:04:24.589 --> 00:04:24.599 
midfield from Panama are able to

00:04:24.599 --> 00:04:26.540 
midfield from Panama are able to
capitalize<00:04:25.110> that<00:04:25.140> they're<00:04:25.830> gonna<00:04:25.950> transform

00:04:26.540 --> 00:04:26.550
