00:00:00.190 --> 00:00:03.740
bobby: Today is super exciting because we're
not only going to make a dish that is going

00:00:03.740 --> 00:00:08.599
to help us beat the summer heat, but I am
with my friend Erica of the blog Everything

00:00:08.599 --> 00:00:14.659
Erica to show us a great summertime recipe,
a zucchini noodle salad with tropical marinara

00:00:14.659 --> 00:00:15.659
sauce.

00:00:15.659 --> 00:00:19.180
erica: This recipe will keep you bikini ready
this summer, which is really really important.

00:00:19.180 --> 00:00:21.300
bobby: And speedo ready.

00:00:21.300 --> 00:00:25.730
erica: Very, it's easy and best of all it
doesn't require any actual cooking.

00:00:25.730 --> 00:00:28.820
bobby: This is raw, it's cool, it's crisp,
it's refreshing.

00:00:28.820 --> 00:00:32.829
Why don't you tell everyone about your blog
and all your Instagram foodie adventures.

00:00:32.829 --> 00:00:35.390
erica: Yeah, so my blog is Everything Erica.

00:00:35.390 --> 00:00:39.739
My philosophy is just a fun light-hearted
easy approach to cooking, so this recipe couldn't

00:00:39.739 --> 00:00:40.940
fit that mantra more.

00:00:40.940 --> 00:00:41.940
bobby: Let's get started.

00:00:41.940 --> 00:00:42.940
erica: Let's do it.

00:00:42.940 --> 00:00:43.940
bobby: What are we doing first?

00:00:43.940 --> 00:00:45.489
erica: First we are going to make the zucchini
noodles.

00:00:45.489 --> 00:00:49.749
This is so easy to do, and I have the, literally
this is easiest tool in the world.

00:00:49.749 --> 00:00:51.639
This is the Chelsea Dale peeler.

00:00:51.639 --> 00:00:56.820
Basically it has a peeler on one side and
a zucchini noodle magic maker on the other.

00:00:56.820 --> 00:01:00.739
You literally just peel the zucchini with
one side, and then you flip it over and on

00:01:00.739 --> 00:01:05.080
the other side it literally just makes the
zucchini noodles for you.

00:01:05.080 --> 00:01:07.950
bobby: Make sure at the end of this video

00:01:07.950 --> 00:01:10.040
That will take you to Erica's blog.

00:01:10.040 --> 00:01:12.740
Follow her on Instagram, she has a rocking
feed.

While you're at it why don't you click that
subscribe button below.

00:01:15.610 --> 00:01:19.830
I am rocking out summer recipes and delicious
recipes every week, and you know you want

00:01:19.830 --> 00:01:20.830
to be a part of them.

00:01:20.830 --> 00:01:22.240
erica: I want to be a part of them.

00:01:22.240 --> 00:01:24.050
bobby: One subscriber right there.

00:01:24.050 --> 00:01:29.180
Okay while you finish up the noodles I'm going
to move on to our raw tropical marinara sauce.

00:01:29.180 --> 00:01:30.640
It's so refreshing.

00:01:30.640 --> 00:01:35.540
It's just pretty much dumping a whole garden
into our blender, buzz it up, and it's so

00:01:35.540 --> 00:01:37.710
easy and so delicious.

00:01:37.710 --> 00:01:41.460
To the blender I'm adding three quarters of
a pound of fresh tomatoes.

00:01:41.460 --> 00:01:44.040
To that I'm going to add a half a cup of sun
dried tomatoes.

00:01:44.040 --> 00:01:46.550
I add a half a cup of diced up cantaloupe.

00:01:46.550 --> 00:01:50.200
The cantaloupe just adds a sweetness to it,
and it has a big water content.

00:01:50.200 --> 00:01:52.260
That's going to help thin out the sauce a
little bit.

00:01:52.260 --> 00:01:55.870
erica: It's perfect too, so a lot of times
people add sugar to marinara sauce to cut

00:01:55.870 --> 00:01:56.870
the acidity.

00:01:56.870 --> 00:01:59.510
In this case we're replacing that with fruit,
which is a much better sugar for you.

00:01:59.510 --> 00:02:02.440
bobby: Agreed, and if you don't have cantaloupe
you could totally use honey dew melon, all

00:02:02.440 --> 00:02:03.440
good.

00:02:03.440 --> 00:02:06.070
erica: What I'm going to now is I'm going
to take a little bit of sea salt, some coarse

00:02:06.070 --> 00:02:07.070
sea salt.

00:02:07.070 --> 00:02:08.380
I'm going to put it right over the zucchini.

00:02:08.380 --> 00:02:12.040
What this is going to do is it's going to
draw that liquid out, and also a little salt

00:02:12.040 --> 00:02:13.040
is good on everything.

00:02:13.040 --> 00:02:14.040
bobby: That's right.

00:02:14.040 --> 00:02:17.760
The funny thing is when I was developing this
recipe in the beginning I saw Erica post something

00:02:17.760 --> 00:02:21.140
on Instagram with the peeler and the zucchini
noodles.

00:02:21.140 --> 00:02:24.040
I called her up immediately and I said, "We
got to make this video."

00:02:24.040 --> 00:02:28.314
It was a match made in heaven, and I think
they're going to like the final result.

00:02:28.314 --> 00:02:29.480
erica: I know they're going to like the final
result.

00:02:29.480 --> 00:02:30.480
It's awesome guys.

00:02:30.480 --> 00:02:34.350
bobby: Next up let's chop some fresh herbage
and get it into the blender.

00:02:34.350 --> 00:02:38.950
Why don't you chop a quarter cup of fresh
basil, and I'm going to chop about a tablespoon

00:02:38.950 --> 00:02:40.840
of fresh thyme.

00:02:40.840 --> 00:02:44.390
Next up two tablespoons of extra virgin olive
oil, the good stuff.

00:02:44.390 --> 00:02:45.690
erica: Some roasted garlic.

00:02:45.690 --> 00:02:49.540
bobby: If you're going to use fresh garlic
I would just do one clove, but you're probably

00:02:49.540 --> 00:02:53.459
not going to kiss anyone the rest of the day,
so roasted sweet is the way to go.

00:02:53.459 --> 00:02:55.680
Next up I have one tablespoon of tomato paste.

00:02:55.680 --> 00:02:59.569
I don't know about you but I love the flavor
of tomato paste.

00:02:59.569 --> 00:03:02.790
Either I'm really weird or I'm onto the next
food trend.

00:03:02.790 --> 00:03:06.220
Next up I have a quarter cup of orange and
red peppers, just roughly chopped.

00:03:06.220 --> 00:03:07.620
The machine will do the work for us.

00:03:07.620 --> 00:03:08.630
erica: Love the colors in this.

00:03:08.630 --> 00:03:09.630
bobby: Yeah, right.

00:03:09.630 --> 00:03:10.630
erica: This is beautiful.

00:03:10.630 --> 00:03:11.630
bobby: It's just like a garden.

00:03:11.630 --> 00:03:13.180
erica: It's like a beautiful tropical garden.

00:03:13.180 --> 00:03:15.599
bobby: I'm going to take the zest off the
lemon.

00:03:15.599 --> 00:03:18.340
I use lemon zest all the time.

00:03:18.340 --> 00:03:19.340
erica: It's so good.

00:03:19.340 --> 00:03:21.940
Just make sure when you're zesting lemon you
don't hit the white part, because then it

00:03:21.940 --> 00:03:22.940
will be a little bit bitter.

00:03:22.940 --> 00:03:23.940
bobby: Right, exactly.

00:03:23.940 --> 00:03:26.920
erica: Then we're going to do the juice of
a half of an orange.

00:03:26.920 --> 00:03:28.300
I got the muscles that's why he did it.

00:03:28.300 --> 00:03:30.850
bobby: That's right today's my birthday.

00:03:30.850 --> 00:03:33.950
Go for the juice of a whole lemon.

00:03:33.950 --> 00:03:35.860
erica: Next we're going to add some soy sauce.

00:03:35.860 --> 00:03:39.600
This recipe actually could be gluten free
if you just wanted to substitute the soy for

00:03:39.600 --> 00:03:42.430
tamari, which is an aged soy sauce, no gluten
in that.

00:03:42.430 --> 00:03:45.150
bobby: Absolutely, next up two tablespoons
of green onions roughly chopped.

00:03:45.150 --> 00:03:47.781
erica: Then we're going to add about a tablespoon
of honey.

00:03:47.781 --> 00:03:48.781
bobby: Squeeze that honey bear head.

00:03:48.781 --> 00:03:52.599
erica: I always feel bad when it's coming
out the top of his head.

00:03:52.599 --> 00:03:55.080
bobby: I feel good for some reason.

00:03:55.080 --> 00:03:56.080
erica: But it tastes so good.

00:03:56.080 --> 00:04:01.460
bobby: A few cracks of pep.
erica: Then a little bit of red pepper flakes.

00:04:01.460 --> 00:04:03.739
bobby: Yes, got to make it a little spicy
in there.

00:04:03.739 --> 00:04:12.140
The hardest part of this now is going "Ah."

00:04:12.140 --> 00:04:14.130
There's a chance it might need more salt or
lemon.

00:04:14.130 --> 00:04:17.990
You could totally adjust it, but wow.
erica: You don't need anything else.

00:04:17.990 --> 00:04:20.049
It's perfect, so fresh.

00:04:20.049 --> 00:04:23.850
bobby: So fresh, and the flavor will develop
over time, so if you make this a little bit

00:04:23.850 --> 00:04:27.190
ahead of time or the day before just remember
the flavors are going to get more pronounced.

00:04:27.190 --> 00:04:28.500
erica: I want to go back in for more.

00:04:28.500 --> 00:04:29.500
It's so good.

00:04:29.500 --> 00:04:30.500
bobby: I know, right.

00:04:30.500 --> 00:04:31.660
erica: Well let's add it to our zucchini pasta
now.

00:04:31.660 --> 00:04:33.620
bobby: Yes, so why don't you toss it up with
that.

00:04:33.620 --> 00:04:36.610
erica: Gladly, God how beautiful is this.

00:04:36.610 --> 00:04:37.610
bobby: Beautiful.

00:04:37.610 --> 00:04:39.470
erica: God if you didn't know you would think
this was actually pasta.

00:04:39.470 --> 00:04:40.470
bobby: I agree.

00:04:40.470 --> 00:04:43.300
If you eat with your eyes first, you're like
this is pasta, it's going to taste more like

00:04:43.300 --> 00:04:44.300
pasta.

00:04:44.300 --> 00:04:45.300
erica: It's going to taste more like pasta.

00:04:45.300 --> 00:04:46.600
I don't know if I'm going to share.

00:04:46.600 --> 00:04:47.610
bobby: Sharing is caring.

00:04:47.610 --> 00:04:50.980
erica: To some people, not when it comes to
this.

00:04:50.980 --> 00:04:51.980
bobby: Oh my God, look at that.

00:04:51.980 --> 00:04:53.260
erica: Should we top it with a little fresh
basil?

00:04:53.260 --> 00:04:54.260
bobby: Yep, absolutely.

00:04:54.260 --> 00:04:57.950
erica: Oh my God, is it possible to fall in
love with a dish, because I may have just

00:04:57.950 --> 00:04:58.950
done that.

00:04:58.950 --> 00:04:59.960
bobby: This might actually take you over the
top though.

00:04:59.960 --> 00:05:02.431
A little bit of really good extra virgin olive
oil.

00:05:02.431 --> 00:05:03.910
Just like you would with a fresh pasta dish.

00:05:03.910 --> 00:05:04.940
erica: Kid knows the way to my heart.

00:05:04.940 --> 00:05:05.940
I mean I'm sold.

00:05:05.940 --> 00:05:07.120
Where's my fork, cheers.

00:05:07.120 --> 00:05:08.120
bobby: Cheers.

00:05:08.120 --> 00:05:09.120
erica: Oh my goodness.

00:05:09.120 --> 00:05:12.600
bobby: Wow.
erica: This looks so good, and it like rolls

00:05:12.600 --> 00:05:14.920
like around your fork just like pasta would.

00:05:14.920 --> 00:05:17.300
bobby: Totally, there's no difference.

00:05:17.300 --> 00:05:19.780
erica: You would never know that that's a
raw sauce.

00:05:19.780 --> 00:05:22.440
bobby: That would fool even the most legit
of Italians.

00:05:22.440 --> 00:05:27.590
erica: Unbelievable, what a way to enjoy the
food you love and still keep it healthy, still

00:05:27.590 --> 00:05:29.210
keep it light, and still keep it raw.

00:05:29.210 --> 00:05:30.830
bobby: I could not have said it any better
myself.

00:05:30.830 --> 00:05:31.830
erica: Thank you.

00:05:31.830 --> 00:05:34.020
