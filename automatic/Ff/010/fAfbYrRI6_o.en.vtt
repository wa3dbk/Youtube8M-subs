00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.290
 Hello dear friends 

00:00:01.770 --> 00:00:07.799
 In touch again Dmitri Shelomentsev 

00:00:04.290 --> 00:00:12.740
 and now I will tell you about how best 

00:00:07.799 --> 00:00:18.180
 just eat soup to lose weight 

00:00:12.740 --> 00:00:20.250
 what do you think is better to eat normal 

00:00:18.180 --> 00:00:22.369
 soup example we have the usual chicken soup 

00:00:20.250 --> 00:00:25.800
 chicken broth and swim in it 

00:00:22.369 --> 00:00:28.740
 potato and embroidery or something from us 

00:00:25.800 --> 00:00:33.090
 the usual ordinary soup is what will be better 

00:00:28.740 --> 00:00:35.969
 eat this soup or cream soup will give you 

00:00:33.090 --> 00:00:38.460
 three seconds to think really 

00:00:35.969 --> 00:00:41.010
 wins and very cool too twice 

00:00:38.460 --> 00:00:44.190
 structures in the hotel what happens when 

00:00:41.010 --> 00:00:46.500
 we go ordinary soup and puree soup with us 

00:00:44.190 --> 00:00:51.739
 stomach so we have the theme of the day 

00:00:46.500 --> 00:00:51.739
 soup of the day soup of the day 

00:00:54.560 --> 00:00:59.320
 and so figuratively portray in your stomach yes 

00:00:58.310 --> 00:01:03.230
 forgive me 

00:00:59.320 --> 00:01:05.900
 flow pathologist here's a picture 

00:01:03.230 --> 00:01:09.670
 figuratively as a tank that is, we will not 

00:01:05.900 --> 00:01:15.460
 draw all your internal organs 

00:01:09.670 --> 00:01:20.020
 let's picture it like this is an ordinary court just 

00:01:15.460 --> 00:01:20.020
 sub-sub a supreme and here is a puree soup 

00:01:23.200 --> 00:01:29.810
 here is super and what happens when we 

00:01:25.790 --> 00:01:32.030
 have eaten here the usual court here we believe 

00:01:29.810 --> 00:01:35.090
 that's filled the stomach that's how much he 

00:01:32.030 --> 00:01:37.850
 takes the usual soup solid particles 

00:01:35.090 --> 00:01:44.390
 let's say there potatoes Misha like all 

00:01:37.850 --> 00:01:47.660
 this is our strength and the strength not know Michelle 

00:01:44.390 --> 00:01:51.110
 michelle new misha liberton 

00:01:47.660 --> 00:01:54.830
 here it is power and all liquid all liquid 

00:01:51.110 --> 00:01:57.020
 quickly left the stomach and level 

00:01:54.830 --> 00:02:02.690
 stomach from the level of food in our stomach 

00:01:57.020 --> 00:02:05.690
 very quickly became small 

00:02:02.690 --> 00:02:07.729
 small what happens very quickly we 

00:02:05.690 --> 00:02:10.220
 a feeling of satiety passes very quickly 

00:02:07.729 --> 00:02:12.920
 pass two hours u if you ate on 

00:02:10.220 --> 00:02:16.150
 dinner soup already want to eat this 

00:02:12.920 --> 00:02:19.550
 case we have afternoon tea nonetheless 

00:02:16.150 --> 00:02:21.680
 if we fly let's say a normal trial 

00:02:19.550 --> 00:02:23.870
 lunch we want to eat that in two 

00:02:21.680 --> 00:02:26.030
 two hours later, you can already eat our 

00:02:23.870 --> 00:02:28.430
 full and what will happen if we sit 

00:02:26.030 --> 00:02:32.360
 structure from example we took exactly 

00:02:28.430 --> 00:02:33.650
 the same soup and just nobody shared it 

00:02:32.360 --> 00:02:36.290
 not shared but just here 

00:02:33.650 --> 00:02:39.140
 blender you brought and whipped I understand 

00:02:36.290 --> 00:02:41.420
 that maybe chicken soup in a blender 

00:02:39.140 --> 00:02:43.730
 would not be much for someone nonetheless 

00:02:41.420 --> 00:02:46.690
 here for the experiment beat the fill 

00:02:43.730 --> 00:02:49.910
 him in our stomach that is eat and 

00:02:46.690 --> 00:02:52.940
 see what happens he here with us 

00:02:49.910 --> 00:02:54.140
 this super it is homogeneous and all this 

00:02:52.940 --> 00:02:57.860
 here is a mass 

00:02:54.140 --> 00:02:58.250
 all of this class is homogeneous and 

00:02:57.860 --> 00:03:01.250
 and 

00:02:58.250 --> 00:03:04.460
 slowly leaves the stomach that is if 

00:03:01.250 --> 00:03:08.120
 the soup in two hours already wanted to eat 

00:03:04.460 --> 00:03:08.690
 the soup, that is, pulls well for two hours 

00:03:08.120 --> 00:03:11.480
 o'clock 

00:03:08.690 --> 00:03:12.110
 then the puree soup is exactly the same tank 

00:03:11.480 --> 00:03:16.820
 accident rate 

00:03:12.110 --> 00:03:20.450
 gives a feeling of fullness 4 hours 

00:03:16.820 --> 00:03:22.910
 this way the cream soup at times wins 

00:03:20.450 --> 00:03:25.880
 namely twice so my you 

00:03:22.910 --> 00:03:28.970
 advice if you suddenly love structures or 

00:03:25.880 --> 00:03:32.959
 don't like mashed soup at least sometimes 

00:03:28.970 --> 00:03:35.780
 start for lunch is super and who is not 

00:03:32.959 --> 00:03:38.120
 knows what a delicious soup can come up with 

00:03:35.780 --> 00:03:41.090
 here is your task for tomorrow is your task 

00:03:38.120 --> 00:03:43.430
 come up with any soup mash found in 

00:03:41.090 --> 00:03:47.540
 Internet if you do not know him 

00:03:43.430 --> 00:03:50.300
 cook and eat here tomorrow 

00:03:47.540 --> 00:03:53.090
 we had an interesting piece with you and she 

00:03:50.300 --> 00:03:55.370
 really working on the connection was killed 

00:03:53.090 --> 00:03:59.530
