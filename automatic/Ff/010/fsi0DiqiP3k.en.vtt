 now we are in the north 

00:00:01.920 --> 00:00:08.610
 wing of the mathematics institute and sit 

00:00:04.920 --> 00:00:13.380
 pure mathematics we are now on the first 

00:00:08.610 --> 00:00:16.730
 floor is a sulfur thing this is an elevator shaft 

00:00:13.380 --> 00:00:22.020
 still there is a kitchen and toilet 

00:00:16.730 --> 00:00:23.340
 that's how you are all wood mounting here 

00:00:22.020 --> 00:00:27.240

00:00:23.340 --> 00:00:32.960
 also with hot water with cold water 

00:00:27.240 --> 00:00:37.380
 to drink tea corner coffee maker 

00:00:32.960 --> 00:00:40.530
 a refrigerator is a powerful machine that 

00:00:37.380 --> 00:00:42.930
 trash bin is a plastic trash bin 

00:00:40.530 --> 00:00:43.469
 and here is this garbage in order to 

00:00:42.930 --> 00:00:45.960
 throw out 

00:00:43.469 --> 00:00:50.390
 Europe in general, all very turned on 

00:00:45.960 --> 00:00:50.390
 ecology try to sort the garbage 

00:00:52.420 --> 00:00:58.500
 all the kitchens here are on each floor I 

00:00:55.690 --> 00:01:02.649
 usually not even one so if you want 

00:00:58.500 --> 00:01:10.380
 drink tea or coffee go far not 

00:01:02.649 --> 00:01:10.380
 you need all these printers and scanners 

00:01:11.520 --> 00:01:17.140
 if someone just needs something of their own 

00:01:15.220 --> 00:01:19.720
 computer choose the number of the printer is not 

00:01:17.140 --> 00:01:24.810
 you print it later in the hallway 

00:01:19.720 --> 00:01:29.710
 you play all the rooms in the hallway 

00:01:24.810 --> 00:01:32.979
 scientists here in this room these three 

00:01:29.710 --> 00:01:36.789
 named topaz dota knows what of the works 

00:01:32.979 --> 00:01:40.990
 they are doctor written name doctor 

00:01:36.789 --> 00:01:47.670
 scientific Ph.D. three people 

00:01:40.990 --> 00:01:47.670
 in one room, unfortunately cramped 

00:01:50.490 --> 00:01:58.110
 here we are again the kitchenette 

00:01:53.689 --> 00:02:05.600
 wonderful tea coffee napkins all 

00:01:58.110 --> 00:02:10.050
 chores here and here we have a common room 

00:02:05.600 --> 00:02:16.160
 show it in detail such a roof then 

00:02:10.050 --> 00:02:16.160
 people sit doing something and vanechki 

00:02:24.130 --> 00:02:28.050
 come back such a glass plate 

00:02:28.110 --> 00:02:31.040
 that everything is visible 

00:02:31.420 --> 00:02:37.910
 here 

00:02:33.710 --> 00:02:43.790
 and another great thing I don't know 

00:02:37.910 --> 00:02:46.040
 it turns out there is no indicator here we can 

00:02:43.790 --> 00:02:47.050
 collage write with no marker but here 

00:02:46.040 --> 00:02:50.390
 someone wrote 

00:02:47.050 --> 00:02:53.750
 you can just take an erase you can drink 

00:02:50.390 --> 00:02:57.880
 calculations lead to argue about what to write 

00:02:53.750 --> 00:02:57.880
 right on the table the dream of any child 

00:03:09.520 --> 00:03:12.300
 ceiling 

00:03:29.420 --> 00:03:34.840
 also have a sock but you found a marker 

00:03:40.510 --> 00:03:43.950
 mail what to draw there 

00:03:49.520 --> 00:03:51.760
 So 

00:03:51.810 --> 00:03:56.750
 will erase the natural fingers 

00:03:54.270 --> 00:03:56.750
 pen 

00:03:57.200 --> 00:04:12.200
 there is an ordinary whiteboard marketing this 

00:04:03.120 --> 00:04:15.889
 anybody painted a plan 

00:04:12.200 --> 00:04:15.889
 apparently from a meeting 

00:04:18.650 --> 00:04:25.889
 that 2 kitchenette 

00:04:21.680 --> 00:04:31.020
 here, too, there is a board with a plan with different 

00:04:25.889 --> 00:04:35.520
 meetings here you see coffee n biscuit for 

00:04:31.020 --> 00:04:38.880
 some community some not on 

00:04:35.520 --> 00:04:41.340
 supposedly broke down if something like that 

00:04:38.880 --> 00:04:45.030
 what different science groups go for coffee 

00:04:41.340 --> 00:04:47.720
 gather and discuss and strategies 

00:04:45.030 --> 00:04:47.720
 scientific 

00:04:49.370 --> 00:04:53.330
