probably the most commonly asked
question<00:00:11.390> we<00:00:11.450> get<00:00:11.690> here<00:00:11.900> in<00:00:12.020> just

00:00:12.280 --> 00:00:12.290 
question we get here in just

00:00:12.290 --> 00:00:14.710 
question we get here in just
tattoo-removal<00:00:12.710> is<00:00:13.310> how<00:00:13.910> much<00:00:14.090> does<00:00:14.330> have<00:00:14.540> to

00:00:14.710 --> 00:00:14.720 
tattoo-removal is how much does have to

00:00:14.720 --> 00:00:17.080 
tattoo-removal is how much does have to
removal<00:00:15.110> cost<00:00:15.400> well<00:00:16.400> there's<00:00:16.640> two<00:00:16.850> main

00:00:17.080 --> 00:00:17.090 
removal cost well there's two main

00:00:17.090 --> 00:00:19.060 
removal cost well there's two main
factors<00:00:17.390> that<00:00:17.600> determine<00:00:18.109> that<00:00:18.230> number<00:00:18.859> one

00:00:19.060 --> 00:00:19.070 
factors that determine that number one

00:00:19.070 --> 00:00:21.189 
factors that determine that number one
is<00:00:19.550> how<00:00:19.820> many<00:00:19.999> visits<00:00:20.449> will<00:00:20.599> it<00:00:20.689> take<00:00:20.900> and

00:00:21.189 --> 00:00:21.199 
is how many visits will it take and

00:00:21.199 --> 00:00:23.980 
is how many visits will it take and
number<00:00:22.130> two<00:00:22.369> is<00:00:22.640> what<00:00:23.119> is<00:00:23.240> the<00:00:23.359> cost<00:00:23.660> of<00:00:23.839> each

00:00:23.980 --> 00:00:23.990 
number two is what is the cost of each

00:00:23.990 --> 00:00:26.560 
number two is what is the cost of each
visit<00:00:24.579> so<00:00:25.579> when<00:00:25.789> it<00:00:25.880> comes<00:00:26.150> to<00:00:26.329> how<00:00:26.509> many

00:00:26.560 --> 00:00:26.570 
visit so when it comes to how many

00:00:26.570 --> 00:00:28.359 
visit so when it comes to how many
visits<00:00:27.199> there's<00:00:27.409> several<00:00:27.650> variables

00:00:28.359 --> 00:00:28.369 
visits there's several variables

00:00:28.369 --> 00:00:30.399 
visits there's several variables
involved<00:00:28.730> the<00:00:29.390> main<00:00:29.630> one<00:00:29.839> is<00:00:29.869> probably<00:00:30.259> the

00:00:30.399 --> 00:00:30.409 
involved the main one is probably the

00:00:30.409 --> 00:00:33.280 
involved the main one is probably the
color<00:00:30.679> of<00:00:30.919> the<00:00:31.039> ink<00:00:31.189> certain<00:00:32.060> colors<00:00:32.509> tend<00:00:33.200> to

00:00:33.280 --> 00:00:33.290 
color of the ink certain colors tend to

00:00:33.290 --> 00:00:34.900 
color of the ink certain colors tend to
come<00:00:33.440> out<00:00:33.560> quicker<00:00:33.890> than<00:00:34.160> others<00:00:34.430> and<00:00:34.730> as<00:00:34.880> a

00:00:34.900 --> 00:00:34.910 
come out quicker than others and as a

00:00:34.910 --> 00:00:38.200 
come out quicker than others and as a
general<00:00:35.510> rule<00:00:35.539> the<00:00:36.500> darker<00:00:37.010> colors<00:00:37.489> tend<00:00:38.120> to

00:00:38.200 --> 00:00:38.210 
general rule the darker colors tend to

00:00:38.210 --> 00:00:39.580 
general rule the darker colors tend to
come<00:00:38.390> out<00:00:38.420> quicker<00:00:38.870> than<00:00:39.140> the<00:00:39.289> brighter

00:00:39.580 --> 00:00:39.590 
come out quicker than the brighter

00:00:39.590 --> 00:00:42.580 
come out quicker than the brighter
colors<00:00:40.100> so<00:00:40.850> your<00:00:41.059> blacks<00:00:41.480> your<00:00:41.780> dark<00:00:42.230> colors

00:00:42.580 --> 00:00:42.590 
colors so your blacks your dark colors

00:00:42.590 --> 00:00:44.080 
colors so your blacks your dark colors
your<00:00:42.800> dark<00:00:43.039> Reds<00:00:43.340> would<00:00:43.579> come<00:00:43.760> out<00:00:43.910> a<00:00:43.940> little

00:00:44.080 --> 00:00:44.090 
your dark Reds would come out a little

00:00:44.090 --> 00:00:46.150 
your dark Reds would come out a little
bit<00:00:44.210> quicker<00:00:44.570> than<00:00:44.899> the<00:00:45.350> bright<00:00:45.649> colors<00:00:46.039> like

00:00:46.150 --> 00:00:46.160 
bit quicker than the bright colors like

00:00:46.160 --> 00:00:47.919 
bit quicker than the bright colors like
the<00:00:46.430> turquoise<00:00:46.910> is<00:00:47.120> in<00:00:47.269> the<00:00:47.359> greens<00:00:47.629> and<00:00:47.870> the

00:00:47.919 --> 00:00:47.929 
the turquoise is in the greens and the

00:00:47.929 --> 00:00:50.470 
the turquoise is in the greens and the
Blues<00:00:48.170> would<00:00:48.410> we've<00:00:49.399> also<00:00:49.609> got<00:00:49.969> to<00:00:50.059> look<00:00:50.269> at

00:00:50.470 --> 00:00:50.480 
Blues would we've also got to look at

00:00:50.480 --> 00:00:53.049 
Blues would we've also got to look at
how<00:00:50.960> much<00:00:51.170> ink<00:00:51.440> is<00:00:51.559> in<00:00:51.679> the<00:00:51.800> tattoo<00:00:52.219> we<00:00:52.850> have<00:00:52.940> to

00:00:53.049 --> 00:00:53.059 
how much ink is in the tattoo we have to

00:00:53.059 --> 00:00:55.060 
how much ink is in the tattoo we have to
also<00:00:53.179> look<00:00:53.420> at<00:00:53.570> what<00:00:53.750> is<00:00:53.870> actually<00:00:54.140> in<00:00:54.559> the<00:00:54.890> ink

00:00:55.060 --> 00:00:55.070 
also look at what is actually in the ink

00:00:55.070 --> 00:00:57.040 
also look at what is actually in the ink
which<00:00:55.339> is<00:00:55.489> in<00:00:55.609> the<00:00:55.699> tattoo<00:00:56.089> so<00:00:56.719> there<00:00:56.960> are

00:00:57.040 --> 00:00:57.050 
which is in the tattoo so there are

00:00:57.050 --> 00:00:58.810 
which is in the tattoo so there are
several<00:00:57.289> variables<00:00:57.949> that<00:00:58.100> determine<00:00:58.250> how

00:00:58.810 --> 00:00:58.820 
several variables that determine how

00:00:58.820 --> 00:01:01.060 
several variables that determine how
many<00:00:59.059> visits<00:00:59.480> that<00:00:59.629> may<00:00:59.780> take<00:00:59.989> it<00:01:00.649> can<00:01:00.859> take

00:01:01.060 --> 00:01:01.070 
many visits that may take it can take

00:01:01.070 --> 00:01:03.639 
many visits that may take it can take
anywhere<00:01:01.519> from<00:01:01.579> two<00:01:02.059> visits<00:01:02.570> to<00:01:03.050> a<00:01:03.079> dozen<00:01:03.530> or

00:01:03.639 --> 00:01:03.649 
anywhere from two visits to a dozen or

00:01:03.649 --> 00:01:06.190 
anywhere from two visits to a dozen or
so<00:01:04.089> so<00:01:05.089> that's<00:01:05.210> one<00:01:05.480> of<00:01:05.540> the<00:01:05.600> big<00:01:05.720> variables

00:01:06.190 --> 00:01:06.200 
so so that's one of the big variables

00:01:06.200 --> 00:01:08.289 
so so that's one of the big variables
the<00:01:06.350> second<00:01:06.710> part<00:01:06.950> is<00:01:07.130> how<00:01:07.670> much<00:01:07.939> for<00:01:08.180> each

00:01:08.289 --> 00:01:08.299 
the second part is how much for each

00:01:08.299 --> 00:01:10.960 
the second part is how much for each
visit<00:01:08.600> well<00:01:09.500> this<00:01:09.680> also<00:01:09.890> depend<00:01:10.400> upon<00:01:10.670> several

00:01:10.960 --> 00:01:10.970 
visit well this also depend upon several

00:01:10.970 --> 00:01:13.240 
visit well this also depend upon several
things<00:01:11.329> number<00:01:11.900> one<00:01:12.200> is<00:01:12.320> probably<00:01:12.560> size<00:01:13.009> of

00:01:13.240 --> 00:01:13.250 
things number one is probably size of

00:01:13.250 --> 00:01:15.580 
things number one is probably size of
the<00:01:13.340> tattoo<00:01:13.549> as<00:01:14.390> you<00:01:14.570> can<00:01:14.689> imagine<00:01:14.780> it<00:01:15.350> takes

00:01:15.580 --> 00:01:15.590 
the tattoo as you can imagine it takes

00:01:15.590 --> 00:01:17.230 
the tattoo as you can imagine it takes
more<00:01:15.770> work<00:01:16.040> more<00:01:16.100> effort<00:01:16.729> to<00:01:16.880> go<00:01:17.030> over<00:01:17.210> a

00:01:17.230 --> 00:01:17.240 
more work more effort to go over a

00:01:17.240 --> 00:01:20.230 
more work more effort to go over a
larger<00:01:17.750> tattoo<00:01:18.200> than<00:01:18.829> the<00:01:18.920> smaller<00:01:19.250> we've

00:01:20.230 --> 00:01:20.240 
larger tattoo than the smaller we've

00:01:20.240 --> 00:01:22.359 
larger tattoo than the smaller we've
also<00:01:20.450> got<00:01:20.720> look<00:01:20.960> at<00:01:21.110> what<00:01:21.290> body<00:01:21.560> part<00:01:21.890> a<00:01:21.950> tattoo

00:01:22.359 --> 00:01:22.369 
also got look at what body part a tattoo

00:01:22.369 --> 00:01:25.060 
also got look at what body part a tattoo
is<00:01:22.490> on<00:01:22.640> certain<00:01:23.570> body<00:01:23.780> parts<00:01:24.229> are<00:01:24.439> harder<00:01:25.040> to

00:01:25.060 --> 00:01:25.070 
is on certain body parts are harder to

00:01:25.070 --> 00:01:27.249 
is on certain body parts are harder to
get<00:01:25.340> to<00:01:25.369> the<00:01:25.820> access<00:01:26.329> is<00:01:26.479> not<00:01:26.630> as<00:01:26.750> easy<00:01:26.990> as

00:01:27.249 --> 00:01:27.259 
get to the access is not as easy as

00:01:27.259 --> 00:01:30.359 
get to the access is not as easy as
other<00:01:27.829> body<00:01:28.130> parts<00:01:28.579> and<00:01:29.390> as<00:01:29.750> a<00:01:29.780> general<00:01:30.229> rule

00:01:30.359 --> 00:01:30.369 
other body parts and as a general rule

00:01:30.369 --> 00:01:33.550 
other body parts and as a general rule
arms<00:01:31.369> and<00:01:31.579> legs<00:01:31.820> are<00:01:32.060> fairly<00:01:32.390> easy<00:01:32.689> backs

00:01:33.550 --> 00:01:33.560 
arms and legs are fairly easy backs

00:01:33.560 --> 00:01:37.630 
arms and legs are fairly easy backs
necks<00:01:34.130> faces<00:01:34.820> a<00:01:34.969> little<00:01:35.479> more<00:01:35.689> difficult<00:01:36.640> so

00:01:37.630 --> 00:01:37.640 
necks faces a little more difficult so

00:01:37.640 --> 00:01:40.569 
necks faces a little more difficult so
we<00:01:37.820> take<00:01:38.060> the<00:01:38.210> number<00:01:38.420> of<00:01:38.630> visits<00:01:39.079> by<00:01:39.979> how<00:01:40.280> much

00:01:40.569 --> 00:01:40.579 
we take the number of visits by how much

00:01:40.579 --> 00:01:42.730 
we take the number of visits by how much
each<00:01:40.880> visit<00:01:41.329> will<00:01:41.479> be<00:01:41.509> and<00:01:42.020> that<00:01:42.619> will

00:01:42.730 --> 00:01:42.740 
each visit will be and that will

00:01:42.740 --> 00:01:45.370 
each visit will be and that will
determine<00:01:42.920> the<00:01:43.340> cost<00:01:43.579> of<00:01:43.729> the<00:01:43.850> tattoo<00:01:44.350> and<00:01:45.350> we

00:01:45.370 --> 00:01:45.380 
determine the cost of the tattoo and we

00:01:45.380 --> 00:01:47.109 
determine the cost of the tattoo and we
hope<00:01:45.649> this<00:01:45.799> information<00:01:46.009> is<00:01:46.579> helpful<00:01:46.640> to<00:01:47.000> you
