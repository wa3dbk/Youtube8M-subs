00:00:10.519 --> 00:00:16.949
 so it is now build from the whole 

00:00:14.219 --> 00:00:19.039
 The style is very similar to the reboot 

00:00:16.949 --> 00:00:21.840
 yes, the same developers are clear 

00:00:19.039 --> 00:00:23.369
 But looks much better so they 

00:00:21.840 --> 00:00:25.730
 have now as for the pc synonymous these 

00:00:23.369 --> 00:00:28.080
 Technique that the hair of teacher very much 

00:00:25.730 --> 00:00:29.970
 look realistic the strands fall 

00:00:28.080 --> 00:00:32.700
 just like a real human 

00:00:29.970 --> 00:00:34.440
 also and the name already tells 

00:00:32.700 --> 00:00:37.110
 so a bit of the tomb raider rise 

00:00:34.440 --> 00:00:39.300
 that now the tomb raider in teacher 

00:00:37.110 --> 00:00:41.309
 more comes out so there will be more teams 

00:00:39.300 --> 00:00:44.430
 give more leave too should 

00:00:41.309 --> 00:00:45.899
 be very tall and relatively complex 

00:00:44.430 --> 00:00:48.180
 unfortunately I did not want to say it yet 

00:00:45.899 --> 00:00:50.280
 whether the then in the main story before 

00:00:48.180 --> 00:00:53.190
 everything happens or whether it is more 

00:00:50.280 --> 00:00:54.809
 but by the way, I think so 

00:00:53.190 --> 00:00:57.059
 we will find out soon 

00:00:54.809 --> 00:01:00.870
 because it comes out already at the end 

00:00:57.059 --> 00:01:02.640
 this year and otherwise it is just 

00:01:00.870 --> 00:01:04.019
 again very tough wet stage staged 

00:01:02.640 --> 00:01:06.810
 So there are many cool ones 

00:01:04.019 --> 00:01:08.250
 camera rides the characters still see 

00:01:06.810 --> 00:01:10.200
 Much better by being too 

00:01:08.250 --> 00:01:12.240
 new animations have motion capturing 

00:01:10.200 --> 00:01:14.280
 and much more polygons so the 

00:01:12.240 --> 00:01:16.680
 faces are much finer it is 

00:01:14.280 --> 00:01:20.509
 just already again a sudden I would 

00:01:16.680 --> 00:01:20.509
 say in the direction of better graphics 

00:01:25.300 --> 00:01:30.440
 then it comes for ps4 and pc that would 

00:01:28.909 --> 00:01:34.820
 I also like to know that we have 

00:01:30.440 --> 00:01:36.350
 of course also asked but the say 

00:01:34.820 --> 00:01:36.979
 that does not just have it like this 

00:01:36.350 --> 00:01:39.320
 Besides 

00:01:36.979 --> 00:01:42.140
 the colleague of microsoft sets the yes 

00:01:39.320 --> 00:01:44.000
 were there too and they stopped 

00:01:42.140 --> 00:01:47.960
 this deal so i think so 

00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:51.259
 still likely for ps4 and pc 

00:01:47.960 --> 00:01:53.060
 then just 2016 when exactly is one 

00:01:51.259 --> 00:01:56.060
 good question I appreciate so three to 

00:01:53.060 --> 00:01:57.050
 six months after release for xbox 

00:01:56.060 --> 00:01:58.820
 if not even want one 

00:01:57.050 --> 00:02:00.259
 a little later so it would be me 

00:01:58.820 --> 00:02:02.300
 wonder if it could not do that 

00:02:00.259 --> 00:02:12.320
 I do not imagine but it was 

00:02:02.300 --> 00:02:14.870
 stop not getting out there so well 

00:02:12.320 --> 00:02:17.239
 What was very nice was as a teacher then 

00:02:14.870 --> 00:02:19.519
 it's in russia and there came 

00:02:17.239 --> 00:02:22.130
 teacher then down such a lead 

00:02:19.519 --> 00:02:24.560
 Amberg and she was right in the middle of it 

00:02:22.130 --> 00:02:27.079
 snow is blizzard and then 

00:02:24.560 --> 00:02:29.410
 extends before her such a 

00:02:27.079 --> 00:02:32.030
 disused city or sonja 

00:02:29.410 --> 00:02:34.459
 industrial area in zur ubs sr estate 

00:02:32.030 --> 00:02:36.440
 abandoned sun and there goes just the 

00:02:34.459 --> 00:02:38.810
 sun on so very nice and this 

00:02:36.440 --> 00:02:40.370
 Whole area serves as a hub as well 

00:02:38.810 --> 00:02:43.660
 with the predecessors since different 

00:02:40.370 --> 00:02:45.980
 places gives the halt as a basis then yes 

00:02:43.660 --> 00:02:49.340
 can be used to continue from there 

00:02:45.980 --> 00:02:51.500
 explore and this area became mine 

00:02:49.340 --> 00:02:54.739
 then also said is bigger than any 

00:02:51.500 --> 00:02:57.019
 have something in tomb raider from year 2013 

00:02:54.739 --> 00:02:58.730
 was in it and you have a lot 

00:02:57.019 --> 00:03:00.500
 many possibilities what now that 

00:02:58.730 --> 00:03:02.030
 fighting by opponents concerns that has 

00:03:00.500 --> 00:03:04.040
 I have seen it too 

00:03:02.030 --> 00:03:05.540
 unfortunately there is no screenshot 

00:03:04.040 --> 00:03:07.010
 which I think is a pity because it was 

00:03:05.540 --> 00:03:09.470
 pretty cool as flexible teacher 

00:03:07.010 --> 00:03:11.720
 So you could go there 

00:03:09.470 --> 00:03:13.670
 you can sneak around with those 

00:03:11.720 --> 00:03:15.739
 Turn off weapons that are so 

00:03:13.670 --> 00:03:17.810
 It was already very much ship 

00:03:15.739 --> 00:03:18.500
 multilayered what has gone by 

00:03:17.810 --> 00:03:20.540
 the action 

00:03:18.500 --> 00:03:22.820
 that was the fight with them now 

00:03:20.540 --> 00:03:24.620
 animals, for example, who does not like that 

00:03:22.820 --> 00:03:26.420
 the case was clear the bear is angry 

00:03:24.620 --> 00:03:27.920
 trend towards you and then tried 

00:03:26.420 --> 00:03:29.269
 shoot him down with people 

00:03:27.920 --> 00:03:31.660
 different because they are distracting too 

00:03:29.269 --> 00:03:33.370
 and because you can separate them 

00:03:31.660 --> 00:03:36.130
 in the group so I found it already 

00:03:33.370 --> 00:03:38.700
 very interesting how flexible you are there 

00:03:36.130 --> 00:03:38.700
 can proceed 

00:03:43.140 --> 00:03:48.280
 that is technically still in any case 

00:03:45.610 --> 00:03:51.010
 a bit better probably predecessor too 

00:03:48.280 --> 00:03:52.540
 already very very good teams looked more 

00:03:51.010 --> 00:03:54.340
 I think so well I mean it's lara 

00:03:52.540 --> 00:03:56.380
 croft which should have from time to time in 

00:03:54.340 --> 00:03:58.210
 Leave on the road where I still have one 

00:03:56.380 --> 00:03:59.890
 I'm a bit skeptical 

00:03:58.210 --> 00:04:01.660
 story but you can not do it that way yet 

00:03:59.890 --> 00:04:04.510
 say a lot about it is just like that again 

00:04:01.660 --> 00:04:07.540
 the typical adventure story of larry 

00:04:04.510 --> 00:04:09.190
 want to find a certain artifact then 

00:04:07.540 --> 00:04:11.080
 is there still this paramilitary 

00:04:09.190 --> 00:04:15.340
 organization that would like that too and 

00:04:11.080 --> 00:04:17.350
 then you argue about it and in 

00:04:15.340 --> 00:04:19.239
 staging is one meanwhile 

00:04:17.350 --> 00:04:21.190
 a little spoiled noticed that 

00:04:19.239 --> 00:04:22.960
 one also so a few years ago it would 

00:04:21.190 --> 00:04:24.790
 maybe a bit more effect 

00:04:22.960 --> 00:04:27.100
 been richer when teachers because so 

00:04:24.790 --> 00:04:28.420
 climbs and then avalanche then down 

00:04:27.100 --> 00:04:30.120
 but that does not mean that it is 

00:04:28.420 --> 00:04:32.800
 bad is so it is definitely 

00:04:30.120 --> 00:04:35.620
 top notch entertainment what I have so far 

00:04:32.800 --> 00:04:36.970
 have seen and love for 

00:04:35.620 --> 00:04:38.860
 detail star so if teacher 

00:04:36.970 --> 00:04:40.690
 has different items on your belt 

00:04:38.860 --> 00:04:42.550
 the dangle physically correct if 

00:04:40.690 --> 00:04:44.850
 she moves and that's one 

00:04:42.550 --> 00:04:44.850
 cool thing
