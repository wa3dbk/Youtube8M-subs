00:02:01.649 --> 00:02:03.679 
it may work in the short term but it's
not<00:02:01.829> going<00:02:02.039> to<00:02:02.130> work<00:02:02.249> in<00:02:02.399> the<00:02:02.489> long<00:02:02.700> term<00:02:03.029> and

00:02:03.679 --> 00:02:03.689 
not going to work in the long term and

00:02:03.689 --> 00:02:05.749 
not going to work in the long term and
so<00:02:04.139> this<00:02:04.349> is<00:02:04.529> what<00:02:04.709> you<00:02:04.859> can<00:02:05.130> see<00:02:05.429> in<00:02:05.669> the

00:02:05.749 --> 00:02:05.759 
so this is what you can see in the

00:02:05.759 --> 00:02:08.389 
so this is what you can see in the
letter<00:02:05.999> n<00:02:06.239> is<00:02:07.229> this<00:02:07.560> relationship<00:02:08.220> between

00:02:08.389 --> 00:02:08.399 
letter n is this relationship between

00:02:08.399 --> 00:02:09.529 
letter n is this relationship between
South<00:02:08.819> and<00:02:09.000> other<00:02:09.179> and
