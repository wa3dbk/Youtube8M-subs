00:00:07.610 --> 00:00:07.620 
know I've been getting really big into

00:00:07.620 --> 00:00:09.290 
know I've been getting really big into
drones<00:00:07.890> recently<00:00:08.069> I<00:00:08.519> just<00:00:08.610> bought<00:00:08.880> a<00:00:08.910> DJI

00:00:09.290 --> 00:00:09.300 
drones recently I just bought a DJI

00:00:09.300 --> 00:00:11.870 
drones recently I just bought a DJI
phantom<00:00:09.780> 2<00:00:09.860> so<00:00:10.860> since<00:00:11.099> the<00:00:11.219> drone<00:00:11.460> seen<00:00:11.670> here

00:00:11.870 --> 00:00:11.880 
phantom 2 so since the drone seen here

00:00:11.880 --> 00:00:13.370 
phantom 2 so since the drone seen here
is<00:00:12.030> definitely<00:00:12.509> popping<00:00:12.719> we're<00:00:13.080> gonna<00:00:13.170> go<00:00:13.259> and

00:00:13.370 --> 00:00:13.380 
is definitely popping we're gonna go and

00:00:13.380 --> 00:00:15.140 
is definitely popping we're gonna go and
check<00:00:13.500> out<00:00:13.650> all<00:00:13.950> or<00:00:14.460> at<00:00:14.580> least<00:00:14.639> the<00:00:14.910> cool

00:00:15.140 --> 00:00:15.150 
check out all or at least the cool

00:00:15.150 --> 00:00:17.029 
check out all or at least the cool
drones<00:00:15.480> here<00:00:15.780> and<00:00:15.929> just<00:00:16.350> kind<00:00:16.500> of<00:00:16.529> get<00:00:16.710> a<00:00:16.740> cool

00:00:17.029 --> 00:00:17.039 
drones here and just kind of get a cool

00:00:17.039 --> 00:00:28.720 
drones here and just kind of get a cool
conclusion<00:00:17.580> about<00:00:17.789> what<00:00:18.240> each<00:00:18.359> one<00:00:18.539> packs

00:00:28.720 --> 00:00:28.730 

00:00:28.730 --> 00:00:30.880 

this<00:00:29.270> is<00:00:29.420> the<00:00:29.510> e<00:00:29.540> can<00:00:29.840> fly<00:00:30.050> off<00:00:30.320> it<00:00:30.590> goes<00:00:30.710> for

00:00:30.880 --> 00:00:30.890 
this is the e can fly off it goes for

00:00:30.890 --> 00:00:33.340 
this is the e can fly off it goes for
$800<00:00:31.640> the<00:00:31.820> battery<00:00:32.060> life<00:00:32.270> on<00:00:32.360> it<00:00:32.510> is<00:00:32.630> 20<00:00:33.080> to<00:00:33.170> 30

00:00:33.340 --> 00:00:33.350 
$800 the battery life on it is 20 to 30

00:00:33.350 --> 00:00:35.290 
$800 the battery life on it is 20 to 30
minutes<00:00:33.710> and<00:00:33.830> it<00:00:33.980> records<00:00:34.280> in<00:00:34.610> 1080<00:00:35.030> and

00:00:35.290 --> 00:00:35.300 
minutes and it records in 1080 and

00:00:35.300 --> 00:00:37.750 
minutes and it records in 1080 and
there's<00:00:35.720> an<00:00:35.840> fpv<00:00:36.320> on<00:00:36.530> the<00:00:36.620> controller<00:00:36.980> and<00:00:37.460> it

00:00:37.750 --> 00:00:37.760 
there's an fpv on the controller and it

00:00:37.760 --> 00:00:45.319 
there's an fpv on the controller and it
looks<00:00:37.910> pretty<00:00:38.090> cool

00:00:45.319 --> 00:00:45.329 

00:00:45.329 --> 00:00:48.440 

so<00:00:45.840> this<00:00:45.960> is<00:00:46.079> the<00:00:46.170> RC<00:00:46.350> logger<00:00:46.800> Nova<00:00:47.309> X<00:00:47.489> 350<00:00:48.270> it

00:00:48.440 --> 00:00:48.450 
so this is the RC logger Nova X 350 it

00:00:48.450 --> 00:00:50.479 
so this is the RC logger Nova X 350 it
goes<00:00:48.570> through<00:00:48.750> 579<00:00:49.320> with<00:00:49.829> the<00:00:49.920> transmitter<00:00:50.370> of

00:00:50.479 --> 00:00:50.489 
goes through 579 with the transmitter of

00:00:50.489 --> 00:00:52.580 
goes through 579 with the transmitter of
the<00:00:50.610> remote<00:00:50.820> control<00:00:51.180> 22<00:00:51.899> minutes<00:00:52.140> light<00:00:52.320> I'm

00:00:52.580 --> 00:00:52.590 
the remote control 22 minutes light I'm

00:00:52.590 --> 00:00:56.240 
the remote control 22 minutes light I'm
there's<00:00:53.040> no<00:00:53.510> fpv<00:00:54.510> or<00:00:54.750> camera<00:00:55.140> on<00:00:55.230> there<00:00:55.470> but

00:00:56.240 --> 00:00:56.250 
there's no fpv or camera on there but

00:00:56.250 --> 00:00:57.590 
there's no fpv or camera on there but
it's<00:00:56.340> a<00:00:56.399> pretty<00:00:56.550> solid<00:00:56.730> drone<00:00:57.059> and<00:00:57.239> it<00:00:57.510> is

00:00:57.590 --> 00:00:57.600 
it's a pretty solid drone and it is

00:00:57.600 --> 00:01:00.110 
it's a pretty solid drone and it is
carbon<00:00:57.960> fiber<00:00:58.170> I<00:00:58.470> like<00:00:59.070> carbon<00:00:59.399> fiber<00:00:59.430> so<00:00:59.850> RC

00:01:00.110 --> 00:01:00.120 
carbon fiber I like carbon fiber so RC

00:01:00.120 --> 00:01:02.240 
carbon fiber I like carbon fiber so RC
logger<00:01:00.329> offers<00:01:00.750> a<00:01:00.780> bevy<00:01:01.230> of<00:01:01.379> options<00:01:01.920> you<00:01:02.040> have

00:01:02.240 --> 00:01:02.250 
logger offers a bevy of options you have

00:01:02.250 --> 00:01:04.219 
logger offers a bevy of options you have
a<00:01:02.460> gimbal<00:01:02.909> you<00:01:03.150> can<00:01:03.300> add<00:01:03.480> a<00:01:03.510> camera<00:01:04.050> mount

00:01:04.219 --> 00:01:04.229 
a gimbal you can add a camera mount

00:01:04.229 --> 00:01:05.930 
a gimbal you can add a camera mount
cameras<00:01:04.739> that<00:01:04.830> they<00:01:05.009> make<00:01:05.220> and<00:01:05.460> then<00:01:05.700> you<00:01:05.820> can

00:01:05.930 --> 00:01:05.940 
cameras that they make and then you can

00:01:05.940 --> 00:01:07.609 
cameras that they make and then you can
add<00:01:06.030> a<00:01:06.060> GoPro<00:01:06.479> they<00:01:07.020> got<00:01:07.170> tons<00:01:07.320> of<00:01:07.470> options

00:01:07.609 --> 00:01:07.619 
add a GoPro they got tons of options

00:01:07.619 --> 00:01:08.990 
add a GoPro they got tons of options
here<00:01:07.920> and<00:01:08.220> that's<00:01:08.369> really<00:01:08.490> awesome<00:01:08.820> if<00:01:08.909> you're

00:01:08.990 --> 00:01:09.000 
here and that's really awesome if you're

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:10.359 
here and that's really awesome if you're
looking<00:01:09.270> for<00:01:09.420> a<00:01:09.479> drone

00:01:10.359 --> 00:01:10.369 
looking for a drone

00:01:10.369 --> 00:01:13.460 
looking for a drone
where<00:01:11.369> are<00:01:11.670> all<00:01:12.030> of<00:01:12.060> these<00:01:12.390> drones<00:01:12.750> I<00:01:13.110> think

00:01:13.460 --> 00:01:13.470 
where are all of these drones I think

00:01:13.470 --> 00:01:15.050 
where are all of these drones I think
we're<00:01:13.619> getting<00:01:13.830> close<00:01:14.070> do<00:01:14.640> you<00:01:14.700> think<00:01:14.880> if<00:01:14.970> I

00:01:15.050 --> 00:01:15.060 
we're getting close do you think if I

00:01:15.060 --> 00:01:17.779 
we're getting close do you think if I
ask<00:01:15.300> other<00:01:15.840> drone<00:01:16.200> vendors<00:01:16.619> they<00:01:17.460> would<00:01:17.610> tell

00:01:17.779 --> 00:01:17.789 
ask other drone vendors they would tell

00:01:17.789 --> 00:01:19.580 
ask other drone vendors they would tell
me<00:01:17.820> we're<00:01:18.060> like<00:01:18.149> DJI<00:01:18.539> and<00:01:18.840> other<00:01:18.960> drone<00:01:19.229> people

00:01:19.580 --> 00:01:19.590 
me we're like DJI and other drone people

00:01:19.590 --> 00:01:24.109 
me we're like DJI and other drone people
harder<00:01:22.160> so<00:01:23.160> we<00:01:23.280> just<00:01:23.429> checked<00:01:23.640> out<00:01:23.759> the<00:01:23.880> trace

00:01:24.109 --> 00:01:24.119 
harder so we just checked out the trace

00:01:24.119 --> 00:01:25.910 
harder so we just checked out the trace
drone<00:01:24.420> it's<00:01:24.660> a<00:01:24.750> different<00:01:25.140> concept<00:01:25.380> than<00:01:25.800> what

00:01:25.910 --> 00:01:25.920 
drone it's a different concept than what

00:01:25.920 --> 00:01:28.040 
drone it's a different concept than what
I've<00:01:26.009> seen<00:01:26.280> before<00:01:26.429> as<00:01:26.910> it<00:01:27.420> locks<00:01:27.570> onto<00:01:27.840> an

00:01:28.040 --> 00:01:28.050 
I've seen before as it locks onto an

00:01:28.050 --> 00:01:29.570 
I've seen before as it locks onto an
image<00:01:28.320> and<00:01:28.530> then<00:01:28.619> we'll<00:01:28.800> start<00:01:28.979> recording<00:01:29.460> it

00:01:29.570 --> 00:01:29.580 
image and then we'll start recording it

00:01:29.580 --> 00:01:30.830 
image and then we'll start recording it
goes<00:01:29.700> for<00:01:29.880> five<00:01:30.060> hundred<00:01:30.119> dollars<00:01:30.600> with<00:01:30.810> a

00:01:30.830 --> 00:01:30.840 
goes for five hundred dollars with a

00:01:30.840 --> 00:01:33.499 
goes for five hundred dollars with a
1080p<00:01:31.320> camera<00:01:31.590> in<00:01:31.860> there<00:01:32.070> and<00:01:32.369> it<00:01:33.210> comes<00:01:33.420> with

00:01:33.499 --> 00:01:33.509 
1080p camera in there and it comes with

00:01:33.509 --> 00:01:35.810 
1080p camera in there and it comes with
a<00:01:33.630> controller<00:01:33.960> obviously<00:01:34.520> but<00:01:35.520> it<00:01:35.610> has<00:01:35.700> two

00:01:35.810 --> 00:01:35.820 
a controller obviously but it has two

00:01:35.820 --> 00:01:37.070 
a controller obviously but it has two
different<00:01:35.940> design<00:01:36.330> than<00:01:36.509> when<00:01:36.660> I<00:01:36.720> was<00:01:36.840> used<00:01:36.990> to

00:01:37.070 --> 00:01:37.080 
different design than when I was used to

00:01:37.080 --> 00:01:38.870 
different design than when I was used to
in<00:01:37.380> the<00:01:37.830> reason<00:01:38.039> why<00:01:38.130> we<00:01:38.220> didn't<00:01:38.399> get<00:01:38.460> to<00:01:38.580> go<00:01:38.610> in

00:01:38.870 --> 00:01:38.880 
in the reason why we didn't get to go in

00:01:38.880 --> 00:01:40.609 
in the reason why we didn't get to go in
there<00:01:39.090> and<00:01:39.330> like<00:01:39.509> check<00:01:39.869> it<00:01:39.929> out<00:01:40.170> get<00:01:40.410> better

00:01:40.609 --> 00:01:40.619 
there and like check it out get better

00:01:40.619 --> 00:01:42.350 
there and like check it out get better
angles<00:01:41.039> like<00:01:41.429> we<00:01:41.670> have<00:01:41.850> with<00:01:41.970> all<00:01:42.119> the<00:01:42.210> other

00:01:42.350 --> 00:01:42.360 
angles like we have with all the other

00:01:42.360 --> 00:01:44.300 
angles like we have with all the other
products<00:01:42.810> is<00:01:42.960> because<00:01:43.560> it<00:01:43.679> locks<00:01:43.830> onto<00:01:44.100> an

00:01:44.300 --> 00:01:44.310 
products is because it locks onto an

00:01:44.310 --> 00:01:46.790 
products is because it locks onto an
image<00:01:44.399> and<00:01:44.850> their<00:01:45.119> concern<00:01:45.450> was<00:01:45.780> it<00:01:46.229> might

00:01:46.790 --> 00:01:46.800 
image and their concern was it might

00:01:46.800 --> 00:01:48.290 
image and their concern was it might
lock<00:01:46.950> on<00:01:47.130> the<00:01:47.310> fill<00:01:47.460> while<00:01:47.640> he's<00:01:47.789> recording

00:01:48.290 --> 00:01:48.300 
lock on the fill while he's recording

00:01:48.300 --> 00:01:51.139 
lock on the fill while he's recording
just<00:01:49.020> like<00:01:49.229> not<00:01:49.440> it<00:01:49.920> will<00:01:50.130> not<00:01:50.340> stop<00:01:50.640> recording

00:01:51.139 --> 00:01:51.149 
just like not it will not stop recording

00:01:51.149 --> 00:01:54.229

00:02:16.870 --> 00:02:16.880 
what I've seen with a DJI that's kind of

00:02:16.880 --> 00:02:18.640 
what I've seen with a DJI that's kind of
always<00:02:17.060> gonna<00:02:17.240> be<00:02:17.390> my<00:02:17.510> comparison<00:02:17.900> but<00:02:18.470> I<00:02:18.530> had

00:02:18.640 --> 00:02:18.650 
always gonna be my comparison but I had

00:02:18.650 --> 00:02:20.140 
always gonna be my comparison but I had
a<00:02:18.680> lot<00:02:18.830> of<00:02:18.920> fun<00:02:19.070> flying<00:02:19.310> in<00:02:19.520> so<00:02:19.760> this<00:02:19.880> is<00:02:19.940> the

00:02:20.140 --> 00:02:20.150 
a lot of fun flying in so this is the

00:02:20.150 --> 00:02:21.430 
a lot of fun flying in so this is the
Zano<00:02:20.420> drone<00:02:20.750> it's<00:02:21.020> kind<00:02:21.230> of<00:02:21.260> different
