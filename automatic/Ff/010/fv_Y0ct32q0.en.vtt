00:00:03.120 --> 00:00:06.140 
this video is to show you a secret room
in<00:00:03.300> terminal<00:00:04.259> so<00:00:04.700> recommend<00:00:05.700> a<00:00:05.759> gun<00:00:05.970> where

00:00:06.140 --> 00:00:06.150 
in terminal so recommend a gun where

00:00:06.150 --> 00:00:07.579 
in terminal so recommend a gun where
you're<00:00:06.240> going<00:00:06.359> to<00:00:06.420> use<00:00:06.540> the<00:00:06.720> vector<00:00:07.049> and<00:00:07.319> we're

00:00:07.579 --> 00:00:07.589 
you're going to use the vector and we're

00:00:07.589 --> 00:00:09.680 
you're going to use the vector and we're
going<00:00:07.710> to<00:00:07.770> use<00:00:07.919> lightweight<00:00:08.660> scavenger<00:00:09.660> and

00:00:09.680 --> 00:00:09.690 
going to use lightweight scavenger and

00:00:09.690 --> 00:00:13.610 
going to use lightweight scavenger and
commando<00:00:11.389> so<00:00:12.389> the<00:00:13.019> first<00:00:13.230> thing<00:00:13.349> we're<00:00:13.530> going

00:00:17.180 --> 00:00:17.190 
to do let's get our vector we're going

00:00:17.190 --> 00:00:19.939 
to do let's get our vector we're going
to<00:00:17.250> use<00:00:17.340> spoken<00:00:17.760> aids<00:00:17.910> and<00:00:18.710> throw<00:00:19.710> a<00:00:19.740> knife

00:00:19.939 --> 00:00:19.949 
to use spoken aids and throw a knife

00:00:19.949 --> 00:00:26.120 
to use spoken aids and throw a knife
also<00:00:22.730> so<00:00:23.730> you<00:00:23.789> run<00:00:24.060> over<00:00:24.500> to<00:00:25.500> Burger<00:00:25.769> town<00:00:25.920> to

also so you run over to Burger town to

00:00:26.130 --> 00:00:31.040 
also so you run over to Burger town to
start<00:00:28.279> so<00:00:29.279> we're<00:00:29.369> going<00:00:29.490> to<00:00:29.580> sprint<00:00:29.849> look<00:00:30.810> left

sweet<00:00:45.050> glitch<00:00:46.050> at<00:00:46.320> Burger<00:00:47.010> town<00:00:47.160> and<00:00:47.460> terminal

00:00:47.779 --> 00:00:47.789 
sweet glitch at Burger town and terminal

00:00:47.789 --> 00:00:50.840 
sweet glitch at Burger town and terminal
and<00:00:48.050> I<00:00:49.050> start<00:00:49.469> off<00:00:49.530> with<00:00:49.710> a<00:00:49.860> vector<00:00:50.610> where<00:00:50.820> I

00:00:50.840 --> 00:00:50.850 
and I start off with a vector where I

00:00:50.850 --> 00:00:53.510 
and I start off with a vector where I
can<00:00:51.030> list<00:00:51.210> it<00:00:51.329> to<00:00:51.480> get<00:00:51.629> Durant<00:00:51.960> camo<00:00:52.399> all<00:00:53.399> right

00:00:53.510 --> 00:00:53.520 
can list it to get Durant camo all right

00:00:53.520 --> 00:00:55.010 
can list it to get Durant camo all right

00:01:55.190 --> 00:01:55.200 
sweet back at the beginning so that was

00:01:55.200 --> 00:01:57.650 
sweet back at the beginning so that was
a<00:01:55.280> pretty<00:01:56.280> awesome<00:01:56.490> glitch<00:01:56.910> that<00:01:57.210> we<00:01:57.300> found<00:01:57.479> it

00:01:57.650 --> 00:01:57.660 
a pretty awesome glitch that we found it

00:01:57.660 --> 00:01:59.960 
a pretty awesome glitch that we found it
terminal<00:01:58.050> and<00:01:58.830> we<00:01:59.100> thought<00:01:59.280> we'd<00:01:59.460> show<00:01:59.700> it<00:01:59.850> to

00:01:59.960 --> 00:01:59.970 
terminal and we thought we'd show it to

00:01:59.970 --> 00:02:03.350 
terminal and we thought we'd show it to
you<00:02:00.060> guys<00:02:00.320> good<00:02:01.320> luck
