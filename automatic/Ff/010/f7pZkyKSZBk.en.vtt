00:00:10.040 --> 00:00:14.250
 to solve the issue is that with the 

00:00:12.960 --> 00:00:16.800
 cooks who came to give testimony 

00:00:14.250 --> 00:00:18.810
 to give talks to swear then that the 

00:00:16.800 --> 00:00:19.920
 quality of them here than taking 

00:00:18.810 --> 00:00:21.480
 the papal thing to say that we have 

00:00:19.920 --> 00:00:24.949
 people's credibility of why 

00:00:21.480 --> 00:00:24.949

00:00:32.420 --> 00:00:36.080
 What I liked the most about what I've 

00:00:34.190 --> 00:00:37.720

00:00:42.890 --> 00:00:47.870
 they are making each one of them 1 

00:00:45.290 --> 00:00:50.500
 at 10 we put 20 the truth that is 

00:00:47.870 --> 00:00:50.500
 very rich 

00:00:51.300 --> 00:00:54.960
 I think it 's a great opportunity to 

00:00:52.860 --> 00:00:56.730
 live not for us from the side 

00:00:54.960 --> 00:00:58.410
 what matters most is a matter of 

00:00:56.730 --> 00:01:00.840
 relate to people who eat what 

00:00:58.410 --> 00:01:02.370
 what you cook and can give a little 

00:01:00.840 --> 00:01:04.830
 what we do if we are not to be 

00:01:02.370 --> 00:01:06.900
 participating today with people you admire 

00:01:04.830 --> 00:01:09.350
 with people you know with people with 

00:01:06.900 --> 00:01:12.659
 which coincides is very father to live 

00:01:09.350 --> 00:01:14.280
 them also with a lot of 

00:01:12.659 --> 00:01:16.979
 men and women who come from other 

00:01:14.280 --> 00:01:18.530
 latitudes of the country and the world to 

00:01:16.979 --> 00:01:21.830
 exchange gastronomic experiences 

00:01:18.530 --> 00:01:21.830
 it is fascinating 

00:01:25.420 --> 00:01:32.439
 shepherd with the finger I put on I put 

00:01:29.290 --> 00:01:34.020
 to help him marrugo with his legs 

00:01:32.439 --> 00:01:36.549
 pork that they know are delicious 

00:01:34.020 --> 00:01:39.850
 but I skated the oven door and 

00:01:36.549 --> 00:01:41.380
 hit me then then you can cut yourself 

00:01:39.850 --> 00:01:43.390
 you can burn we pass the things to you 

00:01:41.380 --> 00:01:45.610
 but well how did these people react 

00:01:43.390 --> 00:01:47.560
 of civil protection and he served us very 

00:01:45.610 --> 00:01:49.149
 well that's how you have to continue 

00:01:47.560 --> 00:01:51.399
 I did not really like it 

00:01:49.149 --> 00:01:52.810
 excellent than those that lend themselves to 

00:01:51.399 --> 00:01:55.330
 this because because we always see each other 

00:01:52.810 --> 00:01:56.830
 up on TV I think it's a 

00:01:55.330 --> 00:01:58.479
 good experience for both guys 

00:01:56.830 --> 00:02:00.819
 who participated as to the public in 

00:01:58.479 --> 00:02:02.050
 general and sometimes one says good 7 but 

00:02:00.819 --> 00:02:03.940
 I have not tried anything of them and then 

00:02:02.050 --> 00:02:04.960
 excellent that they give us to taste the 

00:02:03.940 --> 00:02:07.890
 things that they do and I thought 

00:02:04.960 --> 00:02:07.890
 delicious and 

00:02:12.500 --> 00:02:17.340
 but the best thing is that you come and what 

00:02:15.450 --> 00:02:19.290

00:02:17.340 --> 00:02:19.770

00:02:19.290 --> 00:02:21.360
