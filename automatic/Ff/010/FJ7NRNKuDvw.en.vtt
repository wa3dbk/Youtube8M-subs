knocking it's like I drew three cards
there<00:03:54.430> and<00:03:55.660> plus<00:03:56.660> I'm<00:03:56.950> within<00:03:57.950> range<00:03:58.130> of

00:03:58.300 --> 00:03:58.310 
there and plus I'm within range of

flashing<00:03:58.700> it<00:03:58.790> back<00:03:58.940> to<00:04:03.580> so<00:04:04.580> the<00:04:05.150> goal<00:04:05.360> here<00:04:05.390> is

00:04:05.680 --> 00:04:05.690 
flashing it back to so the goal here is

00:04:05.690 --> 00:04:13.730 
flashing it back to so the goal here is
to<00:04:05.720> not<00:04:05.990> timeout

00:04:13.740 --> 00:04:16.100 

now<00:04:14.490> if<00:04:14.580> you<00:04:14.670> tax<00:04:14.850> just<00:04:15.240> the<00:04:15.330> voice<00:04:15.450> voice<00:04:15.900> of

now if you tax just the voice voice of

00:04:16.110 --> 00:04:19.160 
now if you tax just the voice voice of
spirit<00:04:16.440> here<00:04:17.540> then<00:04:18.540> I<00:04:18.630> think<00:04:18.810> it<00:04:18.930> becomes

00:04:19.160 --> 00:04:19.170 
spirit here then I think it becomes

00:04:19.170 --> 00:04:21.229 
spirit here then I think it becomes
clear<00:04:19.500> that<00:04:19.620> he<00:04:19.860> he<00:04:20.370> has<00:04:20.520> prey<00:04:20.790> upon<00:04:21.030> and

00:04:21.229 --> 00:04:21.239 
clear that he he has prey upon and

00:04:21.239 --> 00:04:48.290 
clear that he he has prey upon and
trying<00:04:21.510> to<00:04:21.600> slip<00:04:21.810> over<00:04:22.050> the<00:04:22.350> driving<00:04:23.100> century

00:04:48.300 --> 00:04:51.950 

i<00:04:48.419> think<00:04:48.990> i<00:04:49.849> attack<00:04:50.849> with<00:04:50.879> this<00:04:51.150> dish<00:04:51.360> Drake

00:04:51.950 --> 00:04:51.960 
i think i attack with this dish Drake

00:04:51.960 --> 00:04:57.230 
i think i attack with this dish Drake
that's<00:04:52.199> it<00:04:53.120> if<00:04:54.120> you<00:04:54.270> if<00:04:54.659> he<00:04:54.810> jumps<00:04:55.729> my<00:04:56.729> just<00:04:56.940> w

00:04:57.230 --> 00:04:57.240 
that's it if you if he jumps my just w

00:04:57.240 --> 00:05:00.200 
that's it if you if he jumps my just w

00:05:05.409 --> 00:05:05.419 
if there's no block then I think I play

00:05:05.419 --> 00:05:12.170 
if there's no block then I think I play
murder<00:05:06.419> of<00:05:06.629> crows<00:05:07.970> and<00:05:08.970> typhoid<00:05:09.900> rats<00:05:11.150> and<00:05:12.150> I
