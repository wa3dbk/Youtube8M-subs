one<00:00:00.269> of<00:00:00.359> the<00:00:00.450> other<00:00:00.539> products<00:00:01.050> that<00:00:01.140> I<00:00:01.620> know

00:00:01.790 --> 00:00:01.800 
one of the other products that I know

00:00:01.800 --> 00:00:03.949 
one of the other products that I know
you<00:00:01.949> have<00:00:02.159> a<00:00:02.190> sample<00:00:02.520> of<00:00:02.730> here<00:00:03.060> that<00:00:03.659> was<00:00:03.810> the

00:00:03.949 --> 00:00:03.959 
you have a sample of here that was the

00:00:03.959 --> 00:00:06.410 
you have a sample of here that was the
next<00:00:04.440> Genesis<00:00:05.040> I<00:00:05.160> believe<00:00:05.520> of<00:00:05.790> the<00:00:05.970> original

00:00:06.410 --> 00:00:06.420 
next Genesis I believe of the original

00:00:06.420 --> 00:00:08.960 
next Genesis I believe of the original
sansamp<00:00:06.930> concept<00:00:07.470> was<00:00:07.620> the<00:00:08.010> PSA<00:00:08.460> one<00:00:08.730> yeah

00:00:08.960 --> 00:00:08.970 
sansamp concept was the PSA one yeah

00:00:08.970 --> 00:00:11.060 
sansamp concept was the PSA one yeah
this<00:00:09.179> is<00:00:09.360> a<00:00:09.540> prototype<00:00:10.050> you<00:00:10.410> can<00:00:10.590> see<00:00:10.800> it's<00:00:10.950> a

00:00:11.060 --> 00:00:11.070 
this is a prototype you can see it's a

00:00:11.070 --> 00:00:13.910 
this is a prototype you can see it's a
bunch<00:00:11.309> of<00:00:11.570> wiring<00:00:12.570> so<00:00:13.080> look<00:00:13.230> looks<00:00:13.500> like<00:00:13.740> one

00:00:13.910 --> 00:00:13.920 
bunch of wiring so look looks like one

00:00:13.920 --> 00:00:15.770 
bunch of wiring so look looks like one
of<00:00:13.950> those<00:00:14.190> original<00:00:14.880> computers<00:00:15.450> you<00:00:15.660> know<00:00:15.690> I

00:00:15.770 --> 00:00:15.780 
of those original computers you know I

00:00:15.780 --> 00:00:19.150 
of those original computers you know I
took<00:00:16.289> up<00:00:16.470> a<00:00:16.590> room<00:00:16.940> but<00:00:17.940> that<00:00:18.270> was<00:00:18.420> the<00:00:18.600> original

00:00:19.150 --> 00:00:19.160 
took up a room but that was the original

00:00:19.160 --> 00:00:22.279 
took up a room but that was the original
PSA<00:00:20.160> one<00:00:20.430> and<00:00:20.789> basically<00:00:21.660> it's<00:00:21.869> came<00:00:22.050> about

00:00:22.279 --> 00:00:22.289 
PSA one and basically it's came about

00:00:22.289 --> 00:00:24.890 
PSA one and basically it's came about
that<00:00:22.650> people<00:00:23.460> loved<00:00:23.789> it<00:00:23.970> the<00:00:24.210> same<00:00:24.570> time<00:00:24.750> they

00:00:24.890 --> 00:00:24.900 
that people loved it the same time they

00:00:24.900 --> 00:00:26.870 
that people loved it the same time they
said<00:00:25.080> i<00:00:25.199> love<00:00:25.500> this<00:00:25.650> thing<00:00:25.859> but<00:00:26.070> i<00:00:26.310> want<00:00:26.820> to

00:00:26.870 --> 00:00:26.880 
said i love this thing but i want to

00:00:26.880 --> 00:00:29.419 
said i love this thing but i want to
change<00:00:27.180> the<00:00:27.359> sign<00:00:27.599> on<00:00:27.840> uh<00:00:27.990> on<00:00:28.380> an<00:00:28.680> instant<00:00:29.160> you

00:00:29.419 --> 00:00:29.429 
change the sign on uh on an instant you

00:00:29.429 --> 00:00:31.880 
change the sign on uh on an instant you
know<00:00:29.580> is<00:00:30.420> there<00:00:30.660> a<00:00:30.689> way<00:00:30.810> to<00:00:30.840> do<00:00:31.170> it<00:00:31.320> so<00:00:31.560> we<00:00:31.679> came

00:00:31.880 --> 00:00:31.890 
know is there a way to do it so we came

00:00:31.890 --> 00:00:35.450 
know is there a way to do it so we came
up<00:00:31.920> with<00:00:32.189> this<00:00:32.279> concept<00:00:32.340> and<00:00:33.829> we<00:00:34.829> solved<00:00:35.130> a<00:00:35.250> lot

00:00:35.450 --> 00:00:35.460 
up with this concept and we solved a lot

00:00:35.460 --> 00:00:39.500 
up with this concept and we solved a lot
of<00:00:36.000> this<00:00:36.239> 22<00:00:37.200> top<00:00:37.710> touring<00:00:38.520> musicians<00:00:39.059> enough

00:00:39.500 --> 00:00:39.510 
of this 22 top touring musicians enough

00:00:39.510 --> 00:00:43.760 
of this 22 top touring musicians enough
like<00:00:39.870> i'll<00:00:41.629> try<00:00:42.629> to<00:00:42.690> think<00:00:42.930> of<00:00:43.110> name<00:00:43.260> in<00:00:43.649> a

00:00:43.760 --> 00:00:43.770 
like i'll try to think of name in a

00:00:43.770 --> 00:00:49.400 
like i'll try to think of name in a
second<00:00:44.129> ah<00:00:44.250> my<00:00:44.760> stevia<00:00:45.300> and<00:00:48.289> also<00:00:49.289> I<00:00:49.320> think

00:00:49.400 --> 00:00:49.410 
second ah my stevia and also I think

00:00:49.410 --> 00:00:52.069 
second ah my stevia and also I think
originally<00:00:49.829> Galilee<00:00:50.789> was<00:00:51.000> using<00:00:51.360> this<00:00:51.570> before

00:00:52.069 --> 00:00:52.079 
originally Galilee was using this before

00:00:52.079 --> 00:00:54.709 
originally Galilee was using this before
we<00:00:52.230> built<00:00:52.469> the<00:00:52.680> out<00:00:52.829> base<00:00:53.520> yes<00:00:53.969> version<00:00:54.480> really

00:00:54.709 --> 00:00:54.719 
we built the out base yes version really

00:00:54.719 --> 00:00:59.510 
we built the out base yes version really
version<00:00:55.350> on<00:00:55.469> it<00:00:55.649> and<00:00:56.210> a<00:00:57.500> lot<00:00:58.500> of<00:00:58.559> studios<00:00:59.010> have

00:00:59.510 --> 00:00:59.520 
version on it and a lot of studios have

00:00:59.520 --> 00:01:02.540 
version on it and a lot of studios have
it<00:00:59.699> in<00:01:00.180> the<00:01:00.359> rack<00:01:00.629> because<00:01:01.190> even<00:01:02.190> though<00:01:02.340> there

00:01:02.540 --> 00:01:02.550 
it in the rack because even though there

00:01:02.550 --> 00:01:04.130 
it in the rack because even though there
are<00:01:02.640> a<00:01:02.699> lot<00:01:02.850> of<00:01:02.879> digital<00:01:03.329> products<00:01:03.719> now<00:01:03.899> that

00:01:04.130 --> 00:01:04.140 
are a lot of digital products now that

00:01:04.140 --> 00:01:06.920 
are a lot of digital products now that
do<00:01:04.260> have<00:01:04.439> emulation<00:01:05.220> this<00:01:06.030> was<00:01:06.210> the<00:01:06.240> first<00:01:06.420> one

00:01:06.920 --> 00:01:06.930 
do have emulation this was the first one

00:01:06.930 --> 00:01:09.740 
do have emulation this was the first one
and<00:01:07.140> it<00:01:07.890> still<00:01:08.130> has<00:01:08.310> some<00:01:08.580> sounds<00:01:09.150> that<00:01:09.330> a

00:01:09.740 --> 00:01:09.750 
and it still has some sounds that a

00:01:09.750 --> 00:01:14.240 
and it still has some sounds that a
uniquely<00:01:10.909> analog<00:01:11.909> yes<00:01:12.299> all<00:01:12.830> for<00:01:13.830> example<00:01:14.159> if

00:01:14.240 --> 00:01:14.250 
uniquely analog yes all for example if

00:01:14.250 --> 00:01:19.749 
uniquely analog yes all for example if
you<00:01:14.340> want<00:01:14.520> to<00:01:14.610> have<00:01:14.760> a<00:01:14.790> really<00:01:15.210> bright<00:01:15.570> crispy

00:01:19.749 --> 00:01:19.759 

00:01:19.759 --> 00:01:23.480 

guitar<00:01:20.759> sound<00:01:21.090> like<00:01:21.330> its<00:01:21.509> rings<00:01:21.750> out<00:01:21.990> I<00:01:22.460> have<00:01:23.460> a

very<00:01:23.790> tough<00:01:24.090> time<00:01:24.299> to<00:01:24.479> get<00:01:24.630> that<00:01:24.780> out<00:01:24.930> of<00:01:24.960> a

00:01:25.100 --> 00:01:25.110 
very tough time to get that out of a

00:01:25.110 --> 00:01:26.899 
very tough time to get that out of a
digital<00:01:25.470> product<00:01:25.710> I<00:01:25.950> don't<00:01:26.159> know<00:01:26.220> why<00:01:26.400> but

00:01:26.899 --> 00:01:26.909 
digital product I don't know why but

00:01:26.909 --> 00:01:30.170 
digital product I don't know why but
somehow<00:01:27.540> they<00:01:28.530> just<00:01:28.829> not<00:01:29.369> done<00:01:29.610> for<00:01:29.790> that<00:01:29.970> they

00:01:30.170 --> 00:01:30.180 
somehow they just not done for that they

00:01:30.180 --> 00:01:31.910 
somehow they just not done for that they
can<00:01:30.360> do<00:01:30.509> a<00:01:30.540> really<00:01:30.780> good<00:01:30.930> distortion<00:01:31.740> and

00:01:31.910 --> 00:01:31.920

00:01:34.969 --> 00:01:34.979 
really you know fuzzy stuff and narrow

00:01:34.979 --> 00:01:38.450 
really you know fuzzy stuff and narrow
but<00:01:35.520> that<00:01:35.700> ringing<00:01:36.180> like<00:01:36.450> vox<00:01:37.079> like<00:01:37.500> sound<00:01:38.009> yes

00:01:38.450 --> 00:01:38.460

fender blondes so I even ants I don't

00:02:14.730 --> 00:02:16.100 
fender blondes so I even ants I don't
have<00:02:14.880> I<00:02:14.910> just<00:02:15.030> asked<00:02:15.390> them<00:02:15.510> to<00:02:15.660> bring<00:02:15.690> it<00:02:15.959> in

00:02:16.100 --> 00:02:16.110 
have I just asked them to bring it in

00:02:16.110 --> 00:02:17.750 
have I just asked them to bring it in
they're<00:02:16.739> basically<00:02:17.130> your<00:02:17.370> own<00:02:17.489> collection

00:02:17.750 --> 00:02:17.760 
they're basically your own collection

00:02:17.760 --> 00:02:19.040 
they're basically your own collection
it's<00:02:18.209> just<00:02:18.360> a<00:02:18.420> matter<00:02:18.569> when<00:02:18.780> you<00:02:18.870> need<00:02:18.959> to

00:02:19.040 --> 00:02:19.050 
it's just a matter when you need to

00:02:19.050 --> 00:02:20.750 
it's just a matter when you need to
borrow<00:02:19.290> something<00:02:19.590> exactly<00:02:20.069> and<00:02:20.459> then<00:02:20.640> they

00:02:20.750 --> 00:02:20.760 
borrow something exactly and then they

00:02:20.760 --> 00:02:23.390 
borrow something exactly and then they
have<00:02:20.880> all<00:02:21.060> the<00:02:21.209> out<00:02:21.360> the<00:02:21.810> wall<00:02:22.770> pedals<00:02:23.160> you

00:02:23.390 --> 00:02:23.400 
have all the out the wall pedals you

00:02:23.400 --> 00:02:25.550 
have all the out the wall pedals you
know<00:02:23.550> from<00:02:23.849> the<00:02:23.910> 60s<00:02:24.510> in<00:02:24.750> this<00:02:24.959> is<00:02:25.200> just<00:02:25.410> great

00:02:25.550 --> 00:02:25.560 
know from the 60s in this is just great

00:02:25.560 --> 00:02:27.229 
know from the 60s in this is just great
you<00:02:25.680> know<00:02:25.890> well<00:02:26.220> everything<00:02:26.610> and<00:02:26.760> I<00:02:26.790> thought

00:02:27.229 --> 00:02:27.239 
you know well everything and I thought

00:02:27.239 --> 00:02:28.460 
you know well everything and I thought
that<00:02:27.420> that<00:02:27.660> might<00:02:27.840> actually<00:02:28.050> be<00:02:28.290> a<00:02:28.319> good

00:02:28.460 --> 00:02:28.470 
that that might actually be a good

00:02:28.470 --> 00:02:30.110 
that that might actually be a good
opportunity<00:02:28.739> why<00:02:29.489> don't<00:02:29.640> you<00:02:29.730> tell<00:02:29.910> us<00:02:29.940> a

00:02:30.110 --> 00:02:30.120 
opportunity why don't you tell us a

00:02:30.120 --> 00:02:32.059 
opportunity why don't you tell us a
little<00:02:30.150> bit<00:02:30.360> about<00:02:30.569> the<00:02:30.690> trademark<00:02:30.959> 300<00:02:31.830> and

00:02:32.059 --> 00:02:32.069 
little bit about the trademark 300 and

00:02:32.069 --> 00:02:34.430 
little bit about the trademark 300 and
the<00:02:32.550> launch<00:02:32.849> of<00:02:33.060> tech<00:02:33.300> 21<00:02:33.750> in<00:02:33.930> terms<00:02:34.140> of<00:02:34.260> an

00:02:34.430 --> 00:02:34.440 
the launch of tech 21 in terms of an

00:02:34.440 --> 00:02:37.130 
the launch of tech 21 in terms of an
amplifier<00:02:35.180> manufacturer<00:02:36.180> right<00:02:36.660> well<00:02:37.019> the

00:02:37.130 --> 00:02:37.140 
amplifier manufacturer right well the

00:02:37.140 --> 00:02:39.890 
amplifier manufacturer right well the
next<00:02:37.380> logical<00:02:38.280> step<00:02:38.580> was<00:02:38.970> for<00:02:39.030> us<00:02:39.300> as<00:02:39.480> a<00:02:39.510> guitar

00:02:39.890 --> 00:02:39.900 
next logical step was for us as a guitar

00:02:39.900 --> 00:02:47.259 
next logical step was for us as a guitar
guitar<00:02:40.670> sound<00:02:43.580> manufacturer<00:02:44.580> it<00:02:45.480> was<00:02:45.720> the

00:02:47.259 --> 00:02:47.269 
guitar sound manufacturer it was the

00:02:47.269 --> 00:02:49.880 
guitar sound manufacturer it was the
creation<00:02:48.269> of<00:02:48.510> an<00:02:48.660> amplifier<00:02:48.810> even<00:02:49.440> though<00:02:49.590> the

00:02:49.880 --> 00:02:49.890 
creation of an amplifier even though the

00:02:49.890 --> 00:02:52.220 
creation of an amplifier even though the
same<00:02:50.100> zamp<00:02:50.400> means<00:02:50.670> without<00:02:50.910> them<00:02:51.360> but<00:02:52.080> there

00:02:52.220 --> 00:02:52.230 
same zamp means without them but there

00:02:52.230 --> 00:02:55.009 
same zamp means without them but there
was<00:02:52.260> a<00:02:52.560> technology<00:02:53.280> that<00:02:53.310> was<00:02:53.850> almost<00:02:54.600> begging

00:02:55.009 --> 00:02:55.019 
was a technology that was almost begging

00:02:55.019 --> 00:02:58.729 
was a technology that was almost begging
itself<00:02:55.620> to<00:02:56.370> be<00:02:56.580> put<00:02:56.819> into<00:02:57.000> an<00:02:57.330> amp<00:02:57.540> and<00:02:57.840> become

00:02:58.729 --> 00:02:58.739 
itself to be put into an amp and become

00:02:58.739 --> 00:03:03.530 
itself to be put into an amp and become
a<00:02:59.010> an<00:02:59.519> analog<00:03:00.330> to<00:03:01.110> them<00:03:01.290> emulator<00:03:02.060> so<00:03:03.060> we<00:03:03.330> came

00:03:03.530 --> 00:03:03.540 
a an analog to them emulator so we came

00:03:03.540 --> 00:03:05.630 
a an analog to them emulator so we came
out<00:03:03.690> with<00:03:03.870> the<00:03:04.049> original<00:03:04.200> to<00:03:04.739> trade<00:03:04.950> mark<00:03:05.160> 16

00:03:05.630 --> 00:03:05.640 
out with the original to trade mark 16

00:03:05.640 --> 00:03:08.539 
out with the original to trade mark 16
and<00:03:05.880> the<00:03:06.000> 10<00:03:06.209> then<00:03:06.750> the<00:03:06.870> 30<00:03:07.170> and<00:03:07.530> then<00:03:07.890> 300

00:03:08.539 --> 00:03:08.549 
and the 10 then the 30 and then 300

00:03:08.549 --> 00:03:11.210 
and the 10 then the 30 and then 300
which<00:03:08.730> is<00:03:08.910> right<00:03:09.090> next<00:03:09.239> to<00:03:09.420> me<00:03:10.069> that<00:03:11.069> we

00:03:11.210 --> 00:03:11.220 
which is right next to me that we

00:03:11.220 --> 00:03:12.740 
which is right next to me that we
created<00:03:11.519> for<00:03:11.790> the<00:03:11.880> professional<00:03:12.420> touring

00:03:12.740 --> 00:03:12.750 
created for the professional touring

00:03:12.750 --> 00:03:15.110 
created for the professional touring
musician<00:03:13.200> that<00:03:13.769> gives<00:03:14.040> you<00:03:14.160> a<00:03:14.190> tremendous

00:03:15.110 --> 00:03:15.120 
musician that gives you a tremendous

00:03:15.120 --> 00:03:16.940 
musician that gives you a tremendous
amount<00:03:15.390> of<00:03:15.540> headroom<00:03:15.930> because<00:03:16.560> that's<00:03:16.739> what<00:03:16.829> I

00:03:16.940 --> 00:03:16.950 
amount of headroom because that's what I

00:03:16.950 --> 00:03:18.560 
amount of headroom because that's what I
find<00:03:17.250> that<00:03:17.430> a<00:03:17.489> lot<00:03:17.670> of<00:03:17.820> these<00:03:17.940> two<00:03:18.180> pets<00:03:18.420> are

00:03:18.560 --> 00:03:18.570 
find that a lot of these two pets are

00:03:18.570 --> 00:03:20.750 
find that a lot of these two pets are
great<00:03:18.930> but<00:03:19.560> when<00:03:19.769> you<00:03:19.890> need<00:03:20.070> a<00:03:20.100> very<00:03:20.489> very

00:03:20.750 --> 00:03:20.760 
great but when you need a very very

00:03:20.760 --> 00:03:23.810 
great but when you need a very very
clean<00:03:21.090> senator<00:03:21.630> very<00:03:21.900> loud<00:03:22.170> volumes<00:03:22.799> then<00:03:23.640> you

00:03:23.810 --> 00:03:23.820 
clean senator very loud volumes then you

00:03:23.820 --> 00:03:25.940 
clean senator very loud volumes then you
have<00:03:23.940> a<00:03:23.970> tough<00:03:24.209> side<00:03:24.480> you<00:03:25.230> can<00:03:25.380> have<00:03:25.530> a<00:03:25.560> hundred

00:03:25.940 --> 00:03:25.950 
have a tough side you can have a hundred

00:03:25.950 --> 00:03:31.430 
have a tough side you can have a hundred
what<00:03:27.230> whatever<00:03:28.459> marshall<00:03:29.459> or<00:03:29.489> boogie<00:03:30.440> the

00:03:31.430 --> 00:03:31.440 
what whatever marshall or boogie the

00:03:31.440 --> 00:03:34.490 
what whatever marshall or boogie the
clean<00:03:31.680> sound<00:03:31.980> is<00:03:32.100> always<00:03:32.430> the<00:03:32.640> weak<00:03:33.510> areas<00:03:34.019> so

00:03:34.490 --> 00:03:34.500 
clean sound is always the weak areas so

00:03:34.500 --> 00:03:36.050 
clean sound is always the weak areas so
we<00:03:34.530> wanted<00:03:34.890> to<00:03:34.950> create<00:03:35.100> something<00:03:35.280> with<00:03:35.670> a<00:03:35.700> lot

00:03:36.050 --> 00:03:36.060 
we wanted to create something with a lot

00:03:36.060 --> 00:03:37.910 
we wanted to create something with a lot
of<00:03:36.120> headroom<00:03:36.359> this<00:03:36.660> one<00:03:36.810> has<00:03:36.930> 300<00:03:37.440> watt<00:03:37.620> head

00:03:37.910 --> 00:03:37.920 
of headroom this one has 300 watt head

00:03:37.920 --> 00:03:41.629 
of headroom this one has 300 watt head
room<00:03:38.160> so<00:03:38.670> you<00:03:38.730> can<00:03:38.850> have<00:03:39.090> 300<00:03:39.660> watts<00:03:39.930> clean<00:03:40.739> but

00:03:41.629 --> 00:03:41.639 
room so you can have 300 watts clean but

00:03:41.639 --> 00:03:43.900 
room so you can have 300 watts clean but
then<00:03:41.790> you<00:03:41.970> can<00:03:42.209> also<00:03:42.239> of<00:03:42.720> course<00:03:42.750> have<00:03:43.079> the

00:03:43.900 --> 00:03:43.910 
then you can also of course have the

00:03:43.910 --> 00:03:48.050 
then you can also of course have the
marshal<00:03:44.910> like<00:03:45.120> or<00:03:45.410> boogie<00:03:46.410> lactones<00:03:46.859> out<00:03:47.850> of

00:03:48.050 --> 00:03:48.060 
marshal like or boogie lactones out of

00:03:48.060 --> 00:03:49.550 
marshal like or boogie lactones out of
it<00:03:48.180> and<00:03:48.329> you<00:03:48.420> can<00:03:48.600> channel<00:03:49.019> switches<00:03:49.380> there's

00:03:49.550 --> 00:03:49.560 
it and you can channel switches there's

00:03:49.560 --> 00:03:52.610 
it and you can channel switches there's
three<00:03:49.829> channels<00:03:50.250> with<00:03:51.180> with<00:03:51.540> effect<00:03:52.319> loops

00:03:52.610 --> 00:03:52.620 
three channels with with effect loops

00:03:52.620 --> 00:03:55.879 
three channels with with effect loops
that<00:03:52.950> you<00:03:53.519> can<00:03:53.730> switch<00:03:54.090> a<00:03:54.359> boost<00:03:54.690> the<00:03:55.380> master

00:03:55.879 --> 00:03:55.889 
that you can switch a boost the master

00:03:55.889 --> 00:03:58.879 
that you can switch a boost the master
so<00:03:56.579> it's<00:03:56.880> a<00:03:57.000> very<00:03:57.030> versatile<00:03:57.959> head<00:03:58.200> when<00:03:58.769> was

00:03:58.879 --> 00:03:58.889 
so it's a very versatile head when was

00:03:58.889 --> 00:04:00.979 
so it's a very versatile head when was
this<00:03:58.980> product<00:03:59.400> released<00:03:59.760> it<00:04:00.239> was<00:04:00.269> I'm<00:04:00.750> not
