00:00:03.960 --> 00:00:08.259
 hey i 'm without t-mobile gigs and we 

00:00:06.460 --> 00:00:09.730
 are at blue.de finally came out of the 

00:00:08.259 --> 00:00:11.110
 audio direction and home entertainment 

00:00:09.730 --> 00:00:12.820
 and things do that 

00:00:11.110 --> 00:00:14.409
 usually, but probably 

00:00:12.820 --> 00:00:17.710
 also from this direction if you go 

00:00:14.409 --> 00:00:20.439
 the blaupunkt discovery 3 

00:00:17.710 --> 00:00:23.300
 tablet sees this is a tegra 3 chip 

00:00:20.439 --> 00:00:26.760
 with the head in there 4 to 3 display 

00:00:23.300 --> 00:00:28.170
 9.7 inch ipad format with 1024 x 768 

00:00:26.760 --> 00:00:30.150
 pixel 

00:00:28.170 --> 00:00:32.340
 the devices are unfortunately all fixed here 

00:00:30.150 --> 00:00:34.860
 made because the mobile so the 

00:00:32.340 --> 00:00:36.060
 portable free rum portable samples the 

00:00:34.860 --> 00:00:37.950
 have been stolen outside warehouse 

00:00:36.060 --> 00:00:41.010
 Block the men's product manager 

00:00:37.950 --> 00:00:42.300
 sit upstairs and have coffee 

00:00:41.010 --> 00:00:44.760
 several do not change that 

00:00:42.300 --> 00:00:48.600
 we have to take with us 

00:00:44.760 --> 00:00:49.289
 As I said tegra 3 offered much to 3.7 

00:00:48.600 --> 00:00:50.940
 inch display 

00:00:49.289 --> 00:00:52.469
 then android 4.0 ice cream is running 

00:00:50.940 --> 00:00:55.379
 sandwich the device has one 

00:00:52.469 --> 00:00:57.390
 gigabyte ram and 16 gb memory is n 

00:00:55.379 --> 00:00:59.280
 wlan on board and in this case there is 

00:00:57.390 --> 00:01:01.680
 the beet also a sim card slot 

00:00:59.280 --> 00:01:04.790
 the measuring device 

00:01:01.680 --> 00:01:06.350
 to surf the web 

00:01:04.790 --> 00:01:07.830
 up here, the little camera sits the 

00:01:06.350 --> 00:01:09.570
 Has 

00:01:07.830 --> 00:01:11.280
 Case 1 3 megapixels on the back 

00:01:09.570 --> 00:01:13.920
 still sits a 5 megapixel camera 

00:01:11.280 --> 00:01:15.570
 the battery has 7600 milliamp hours 

00:01:13.920 --> 00:01:16.640
 So probably the new hour says 

00:01:15.570 --> 00:01:17.600
 participate 

00:01:16.640 --> 00:01:20.150
 probably also a bit longer 

00:01:17.600 --> 00:01:21.409
 depending on how it is used either 

00:01:20.150 --> 00:01:23.900
 a book is in it 

00:01:21.409 --> 00:01:25.190
 I already mentioned her here 

00:01:23.900 --> 00:01:27.200
 at the bottom sits the docking connector and 

00:01:25.190 --> 00:01:28.400
 we're trying to be unobtrusive 

00:01:27.200 --> 00:01:29.600
 It could be a bit difficult 

00:01:28.400 --> 00:01:32.330
 as said the councils are solid 

00:01:29.600 --> 00:01:33.890
 hard-glued diana side you have 

00:01:32.330 --> 00:01:34.610
 the speakers each in chrome 

00:01:33.890 --> 00:01:36.650
 edged 

00:01:34.610 --> 00:01:37.940
 on the left side it goes on 

00:01:36.650 --> 00:01:39.320
 First of all, nothing else on the 

00:01:37.940 --> 00:01:41.060
 right side down here again 

00:01:39.320 --> 00:01:42.740
 other speakers then there is the 

00:01:41.060 --> 00:01:44.270
 headphone jack the sim card slot 

00:01:42.740 --> 00:01:47.380
 we have just shown you 

00:01:44.270 --> 00:01:49.210
 the on and off switch for the display 

00:01:47.380 --> 00:01:51.729
 on the upper edge it continues with a 

00:01:49.210 --> 00:01:53.380
 high rocker and that's it on the 

00:01:51.729 --> 00:01:54.880
 back there somewhere down there is then 

00:01:53.380 --> 00:01:57.220
 even the 5 megapixel camera 

00:01:54.880 --> 00:01:59.890
 The devices should be available relatively soon 

00:01:57.220 --> 00:02:02.320
 his 450 euro but what more then 

00:01:59.890 --> 00:02:03.610
 the upper edge should be times 

00:02:02.320 --> 00:02:04.600
 again typical german manufacturer of 

00:02:03.610 --> 00:02:05.920
 the opinion is he has something completely 

00:02:04.600 --> 00:02:07.240
 special at the start 

00:02:05.920 --> 00:02:09.069
 But last but not least is only 

00:02:07.240 --> 00:02:10.810
 mass-produced the housing works, however 

00:02:09.069 --> 00:02:12.730
 quite high quality I do not know if that 

00:02:10.810 --> 00:02:15.519
 Plastic is it feels that is such a thing 

00:02:12.730 --> 00:02:17.260
 bit gummed gray in the future completely 

00:02:15.519 --> 00:02:17.970
 high quality on should also be good 

00:02:17.260 --> 00:02:19.989
 his 

00:02:17.970 --> 00:02:21.700
 550 euros, however, the market is the 

00:02:19.989 --> 00:02:24.340
 already relatively tight this is the 

00:02:21.700 --> 00:02:27.720
 Blockpunkt discovery 3 at ifa 2012 

00:02:24.340 --> 00:02:27.720
 was not roland for mobile gysi
