people are like well I don't know what

00:00:54.649 --> 00:00:56.080

the<00:00:54.739> concept<00:00:55.070> of<00:00:55.129> a<00:00:55.250> co-op<00:00:55.489> game<00:00:55.670> is<00:00:55.789> and<00:00:55.969> I

00:00:56.080 --> 00:00:56.090 
the concept of a co-op game is and I

00:00:56.090 --> 00:00:58.029 
the concept of a co-op game is and I
think<00:00:56.120> that<00:00:56.449> once<00:00:56.929> people<00:00:57.140> play<00:00:57.469> co-op<00:00:57.769> and

00:00:58.029 --> 00:00:58.039 
think that once people play co-op and

00:00:58.039 --> 00:00:59.860 
think that once people play co-op and
really<00:00:58.460> understand<00:00:59.030> what<00:00:59.239> it's<00:00:59.390> like<00:00:59.449> to<00:00:59.719> play

00:00:59.860 --> 00:00:59.870 
really understand what it's like to play

00:00:59.870 --> 00:01:01.959 
really understand what it's like to play
with<00:01:00.440> a<00:01:00.500> person<00:01:00.949> in<00:01:01.070> every<00:01:01.280> move<00:01:01.609> you<00:01:01.760> make<00:01:01.940> is

00:01:01.959 --> 00:01:01.969 
with a person in every move you make is

00:01:01.969 --> 00:01:04.150 
with a person in every move you make is
tactical<00:01:02.629> with<00:01:02.839> that<00:01:03.019> other<00:01:03.170> person<00:01:03.649> then<00:01:04.040> it

00:01:04.150 --> 00:01:04.160 
tactical with that other person then it

00:01:04.160 --> 00:01:06.100 
tactical with that other person then it
becomes<00:01:04.400> kind<00:01:04.580> of<00:01:04.670> its<00:01:05.150> own<00:01:05.330> genre<00:01:05.360> on<00:01:05.810> itself

00:01:06.100 --> 00:01:06.110 
becomes kind of its own genre on itself

00:01:06.110 --> 00:01:09.130 
becomes kind of its own genre on itself
I<00:01:06.320> think<00:01:06.770> that<00:01:06.950> part<00:01:07.700> of<00:01:07.880> the<00:01:08.780> charm<00:01:08.990> of

00:01:09.130 --> 00:01:09.140 
I think that part of the charm of

00:01:09.140 --> 00:01:12.100 
I think that part of the charm of
working<00:01:09.470> on<00:01:09.560> a<00:01:09.710> 02<00:01:09.860> is<00:01:10.420> that<00:01:11.420> you<00:01:11.660> you<00:01:11.990> know

00:01:12.100 --> 00:01:12.110 
working on a 02 is that you you know

00:01:12.110 --> 00:01:14.200 
working on a 02 is that you you know
every<00:01:12.500> day<00:01:12.530> you<00:01:13.160> get<00:01:13.310> one<00:01:13.460> step<00:01:13.670> closer<00:01:13.880> to<00:01:14.150> the

00:01:14.200 --> 00:01:14.210 
every day you get one step closer to the

00:01:14.210 --> 00:01:15.460 
every day you get one step closer to the
end<00:01:14.450> and<00:01:14.630> it's<00:01:14.810> something<00:01:14.990> that<00:01:15.170> you've<00:01:15.439> never

00:01:15.460 --> 00:01:15.470 
end and it's something that you've never

00:01:15.470 --> 00:01:18.160 
end and it's something that you've never
seen<00:01:15.710> before<00:01:15.920> so<00:01:16.610> we<00:01:17.210> are<00:01:17.540> all<00:01:17.689> kind<00:01:17.900> of<00:01:17.960> going

00:01:18.160 --> 00:01:18.170 
seen before so we are all kind of going

00:01:18.170 --> 00:01:20.499 
seen before so we are all kind of going
through<00:01:18.320> this<00:01:18.439> together<00:01:18.619> so<00:01:19.070> it's<00:01:19.220> kind<00:01:19.400> of<00:01:19.509> we

00:01:20.499 --> 00:01:20.509 
through this together so it's kind of we

00:01:20.509 --> 00:01:22.030

I<00:01:37.060> will<00:01:38.060> lecture<00:01:38.210> on<00:01:38.360> my<00:01:38.420> Center<00:01:39.549> because<00:01:40.549> I

00:01:40.690 --> 00:01:40.700 
I will lecture on my Center because I

00:01:40.700 --> 00:01:42.160 
I will lecture on my Center because I
come<00:01:40.850> from<00:01:40.880> Colombia<00:01:41.479> and<00:01:41.540> I<00:01:41.659> seen<00:01:41.900> a<00:01:41.930> lot<00:01:42.140> of

00:01:42.160 --> 00:01:42.170 
come from Colombia and I seen a lot of

00:01:42.170 --> 00:01:44.950 
come from Colombia and I seen a lot of
violence<00:01:42.680> and<00:01:42.799> a<00:01:42.950> lot<00:01:43.369> of<00:01:43.400> violence<00:01:43.880> is<00:01:44.060> a<00:01:44.540> lot

00:01:44.950 --> 00:01:44.960 
violence and a lot of violence is a lot

00:01:44.960 --> 00:01:47.080 
violence and a lot of violence is a lot
of<00:01:45.049> blood<00:01:45.350> and<00:01:45.500> Julie<00:01:45.830> carnal<00:01:46.280> so<00:01:46.880> I<00:01:46.909> think

00:01:47.080 --> 00:01:47.090 
of blood and Julie carnal so I think

00:01:47.090 --> 00:01:48.999 
of blood and Julie carnal so I think
that<00:01:47.299> they<00:01:47.540> are<00:01:47.750> games<00:01:48.470> today<00:01:48.680> they<00:01:48.860> don't

00:01:48.999 --> 00:01:49.009 
that they are games today they don't

00:01:49.009 --> 00:01:51.820 
that they are games today they don't
show<00:01:49.189> that<00:01:49.840> aspect<00:01:50.840> of<00:01:50.960> it<00:01:51.080> you<00:01:51.259> go<00:01:51.380> there<00:01:51.619> you

show that aspect of it you go there you

00:01:51.830 --> 00:01:54.010 
show that aspect of it you go there you
shoot<00:01:52.009> someone<00:01:52.250> and<00:01:52.600> you<00:01:53.600> just<00:01:53.720> shoot<00:01:53.930> them

00:01:54.010 --> 00:01:54.020 
shoot someone and you just shoot them

00:01:54.020 --> 00:01:55.420 
shoot someone and you just shoot them
you<00:01:54.200> don't<00:01:54.289> see<00:01:54.470> nothing<00:01:54.860> that<00:01:55.039> it's<00:01:55.220> about
