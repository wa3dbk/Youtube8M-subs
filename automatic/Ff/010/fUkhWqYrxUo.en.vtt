00:00:45.319 --> 00:00:45.329 
it incorrectly now let's jump right into

00:00:45.329 --> 00:00:49.580 
it incorrectly now let's jump right into
the<00:00:45.510> gameplay<00:00:47.539> so<00:00:48.539> here's<00:00:48.750> our<00:00:48.870> menu<00:00:49.050> system

00:00:49.580 --> 00:00:49.590 
the gameplay so here's our menu system

00:00:49.590 --> 00:00:51.439 
the gameplay so here's our menu system
and<00:00:49.800> I<00:00:50.340> actually<00:00:50.610> really<00:00:50.910> like<00:00:51.059> our<00:00:51.210> menu

00:00:51.439 --> 00:00:51.449 
and I actually really like our menu

00:00:51.449 --> 00:00:55.760 
and I actually really like our menu
system<00:00:51.809> it's<00:00:52.590> based<00:00:52.890> on<00:00:53.100> our<00:00:53.969> whole<00:00:54.320> grid<00:00:55.320> but

00:00:55.760 --> 00:00:55.770 
system it's based on our whole grid but

00:00:55.770 --> 00:00:57.799 
system it's based on our whole grid but
basically<00:00:56.010> exploding<00:00:56.850> you<00:00:57.149> can<00:00:57.300> control<00:00:57.660> it

00:00:57.799 --> 00:00:57.809 
basically exploding you can control it

00:00:57.809 --> 00:01:00.020 
basically exploding you can control it
actually<00:00:58.079> with<00:00:58.199> the<00:00:58.379> Andy<00:00:59.160> keys<00:00:59.430> to<00:00:59.670> panic

00:01:00.020 --> 00:01:00.030 
actually with the Andy keys to panic

00:01:00.030 --> 00:01:02.000 
actually with the Andy keys to panic
left<00:01:00.210> and<00:01:00.420> right<00:01:00.600> you<00:01:01.350> can<00:01:01.500> type<00:01:01.649> in<00:01:01.770> a<00:01:01.829> pass

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:02.010 
left and right you can type in a pass

00:01:02.010 --> 00:01:03.590 
left and right you can type in a pass
code<00:01:02.219> which<00:01:02.370> will<00:01:02.430> change<00:01:02.699> how<00:01:02.820> the<00:01:02.879> level<00:01:03.239> is

00:01:03.590 --> 00:01:03.600 
code which will change how the level is

00:01:03.600 --> 00:01:05.210 
code which will change how the level is
laid<00:01:03.930> out<00:01:03.960> or<00:01:04.409> you<00:01:04.530> can<00:01:04.650> just<00:01:04.710> go<00:01:04.890> into<00:01:05.070> new

00:01:05.210 --> 00:01:05.220 
laid out or you can just go into new

00:01:05.220 --> 00:01:06.530 
laid out or you can just go into new
game<00:01:05.430> which<00:01:05.640> is<00:01:05.760> what<00:01:05.909> wanted<00:01:06.210> to<00:01:06.270> do<00:01:06.360> right

00:01:06.530 --> 00:01:06.540

00:01:10.039 --> 00:01:10.049 
here so mainly in the game see the cells

00:01:10.049 --> 00:01:12.170 
here so mainly in the game see the cells
are<00:01:10.260> blinking<00:01:10.560> on<00:01:10.799> and<00:01:10.860> off<00:01:11.040> and<00:01:11.939> if<00:01:12.060> you're

00:01:35.060 --> 00:01:35.070 
lot of pattern stuff so if I'd fall here

00:01:35.070 --> 00:01:37.160 
lot of pattern stuff so if I'd fall here
which<00:01:35.280> just<00:01:35.850> happened<00:01:36.240> you<00:01:36.420> die<00:01:36.869> when<00:01:37.049> you

talking<00:02:42.630> about<00:02:42.810> a<00:02:42.900> few<00:02:43.080> things<00:02:43.110> like<00:02:43.950> maybe

00:02:44.270 --> 00:02:44.280 
talking about a few things like maybe

00:02:44.280 --> 00:02:46.040 
talking about a few things like maybe
potentially<00:02:44.520> reporting<00:02:45.090> it<00:02:45.180> to<00:02:45.209> the<00:02:45.270> oya<00:02:45.480> just

00:02:46.050 --> 00:02:48.410 
potentially reporting it to the oya just
for<00:02:46.890> funsies<00:02:47.250> just<00:02:47.580> to<00:02:47.670> see<00:02:47.850> how<00:02:48.030> it<00:02:48.060> worked

00:02:48.410 --> 00:02:48.420 
for funsies just to see how it worked

00:02:48.420 --> 00:02:49.690 
for funsies just to see how it worked
for<00:02:48.480> the<00:02:48.630> controller<00:02:48.959> and<00:02:49.110> stuff<00:02:49.260> like<00:02:49.350> that

00:02:49.690 --> 00:02:49.700 
for the controller and stuff like that

00:02:49.700 --> 00:02:51.949 
for the controller and stuff like that
we<00:02:50.700> built<00:02:50.910> it<00:02:51.000> in<00:02:51.090> unity<00:02:51.360> so<00:02:51.510> obviously<00:02:51.810> it's

00:02:51.949 --> 00:02:51.959 
we built it in unity so obviously it's

00:02:51.959 --> 00:02:53.199 
we built it in unity so obviously it's
already<00:02:52.230> portable<00:02:52.620> to<00:02:52.739> quite<00:02:52.950> a<00:02:52.980> few

00:02:53.199 --> 00:02:53.209 
already portable to quite a few

00:02:53.209 --> 00:02:56.870 
already portable to quite a few
platforms<00:02:54.209> in<00:02:54.780> and<00:02:54.900> of<00:02:54.959> itself<00:02:55.080> so<00:02:55.670> this<00:02:56.670> is

00:02:56.870 --> 00:02:56.880 
platforms in and of itself so this is

00:02:56.880 --> 00:02:58.520 
platforms in and of itself so this is
the<00:02:57.000> the<00:02:57.270> game<00:02:57.420> jam<00:02:57.600> version<00:02:57.900> of<00:02:57.959> conway<00:02:58.350> and

00:02:58.520 --> 00:02:58.530 
the the game jam version of conway and

00:02:58.530 --> 00:03:00.050 
the the game jam version of conway and

00:03:00.050 --> 00:03:00.060 
hopefully in the future we make some

00:03:00.060 --> 00:03:02.120 
hopefully in the future we make some
improvements<00:03:00.570> maybe<00:03:00.810> we'll<00:03:00.989> see<00:03:01.200> a<00:03:01.410> more

00:03:02.120 --> 00:03:02.130 
improvements maybe we'll see a more

00:03:02.130 --> 00:03:04.820 
improvements maybe we'll see a more
polished<00:03:02.340> version<00:03:02.700> and<00:03:03.230> yeah<00:03:04.230> anyway<00:03:04.650> we'll

00:03:04.820 --> 00:03:04.830 
polished version and yeah anyway we'll

00:03:04.830 --> 00:03:08.030 
polished version and yeah anyway we'll
