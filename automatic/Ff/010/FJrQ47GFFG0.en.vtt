say<00:02:00.100> in<00:02:00.310> Latin<00:02:00.759> America<00:02:01.179> and<00:02:01.240> Juana<00:02:01.450> mala

00:02:01.740 --> 00:02:01.750 
say in Latin America and Juana mala

00:02:01.750 --> 00:02:03.779 
say in Latin America and Juana mala
again<00:02:02.530> looking<00:02:02.830> at<00:02:02.979> how<00:02:03.190> do<00:02:03.250> you<00:02:03.399> provide

00:02:03.779 --> 00:02:03.789 
again looking at how do you provide

00:02:03.789 --> 00:02:05.910 
again looking at how do you provide
energy<00:02:04.090> efficiency<00:02:04.899> for<00:02:05.020> this<00:02:05.380> particular

00:02:05.910 --> 00:02:05.920 
energy efficiency for this particular

00:02:05.920 --> 00:02:07.350 
energy efficiency for this particular
village<00:02:06.100> to<00:02:06.429> be<00:02:06.520> able<00:02:06.670> to<00:02:06.729> electricity<00:02:07.000> that

00:02:07.350 --> 00:02:07.360 
village to be able to electricity that

00:02:07.360 --> 00:02:10.850 
village to be able to electricity that
they<00:02:07.509> need

00:02:10.850 --> 00:02:10.860 

00:02:10.860 --> 00:02:14.370 

there's<00:02:11.860> science<00:02:12.370> involved<00:02:13.150> in<00:02:13.360> the<00:02:13.720> analysis

00:02:14.370 --> 00:02:14.380 
there's science involved in the analysis

00:02:14.380 --> 00:02:17.460 
there's science involved in the analysis
that<00:02:14.410> we<00:02:14.770> do<00:02:15.040> and<00:02:15.640> the<00:02:16.420> decisions<00:02:17.020> that<00:02:17.170> we

00:02:17.460 --> 00:02:17.470 
that we do and the decisions that we

00:02:17.470 --> 00:02:20.100 
that we do and the decisions that we
make<00:02:17.709> but<00:02:18.280> there's<00:02:19.120> a<00:02:19.180> lot<00:02:19.420> more<00:02:19.450> that's

00:02:20.100 --> 00:02:20.110 
make but there's a lot more that's

00:02:20.110 --> 00:02:22.940 
make but there's a lot more that's
involved<00:02:20.709> in<00:02:20.890> it<00:02:21.069> as<00:02:21.310> well<00:02:21.610> public<00:02:22.270> meetings

00:02:22.940 --> 00:02:22.950 
involved in it as well public meetings

00:02:22.950 --> 00:02:26.130 
involved in it as well public meetings
outreach<00:02:23.950> talking<00:02:24.790> to<00:02:24.880> politicians<00:02:25.390> so<00:02:25.990> that

00:02:26.130 --> 00:02:26.140 
outreach talking to politicians so that

00:02:26.140 --> 00:02:27.420 
outreach talking to politicians so that
they're<00:02:26.290> making<00:02:26.440> the<00:02:26.620> right<00:02:26.709> decisions

00:02:27.420 --> 00:02:27.430 
they're making the right decisions

00:02:27.430 --> 00:02:29.610 
they're making the right decisions
that's<00:02:28.180> one<00:02:28.360> of<00:02:28.450> the<00:02:28.510> best<00:02:28.660> parts<00:02:29.050> about<00:02:29.140> civil

00:02:29.610 --> 00:02:29.620 
that's one of the best parts about civil

00:02:29.620 --> 00:02:31.979 
that's one of the best parts about civil
engineering<00:02:30.040> is<00:02:30.370> that<00:02:30.670> we<00:02:31.180> work<00:02:31.420> with<00:02:31.750> all

00:02:31.979 --> 00:02:31.989 
engineering is that we work with all

00:02:31.989 --> 00:02:34.979 
engineering is that we work with all
kinds<00:02:32.500> of<00:02:32.830> people<00:02:33.450> and<00:02:34.450> if<00:02:34.630> you<00:02:34.870> are

better<00:02:45.040> waste<00:02:45.310> management<00:02:45.880> systems<00:02:46.300> building

00:02:46.770 --> 00:02:46.780 
better waste management systems building

00:02:46.780 --> 00:02:49.020 
better waste management systems building
more<00:02:47.440> energy-efficient<00:02:48.340> buildings<00:02:48.820> or

00:02:49.020 --> 00:02:49.030 
more energy-efficient buildings or

00:02:49.030 --> 00:02:50.640 
more energy-efficient buildings or
definitely<00:02:49.570> civil<00:02:49.870> engineering<00:02:50.200> where<00:02:50.530> you

00:02:50.640 --> 00:02:50.650 
definitely civil engineering where you

00:02:50.650 --> 00:02:53.040 
definitely civil engineering where you
want<00:02:50.860> to<00:02:50.920> go
