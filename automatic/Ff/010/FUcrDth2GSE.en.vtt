00:00:22.540 --> 00:00:28.840
 of 2015 so I'll leave the link 

00:00:26.440 --> 00:00:30.100
 of the direct in the description and what is 

00:00:28.840 --> 00:00:32.200
 what we are going to do then as 

00:00:30.100 --> 00:00:34.690
 I mentioned many times we're going to go to 

00:00:32.200 --> 00:00:37.449
 routes that I have available for 

00:00:34.690 --> 00:00:40.089
 capture a pokémon since I get everything 

00:00:37.449 --> 00:00:42.159
 enough and I want to thank little jets 

00:00:40.089 --> 00:00:45.640
 that is a subscriber that some already 

00:00:42.159 --> 00:00:48.339
 you know he gave me a list of routes that do not 

00:00:45.640 --> 00:00:50.949
 I went to capture pokemon so is the 

00:00:48.339 --> 00:00:53.319
 I'm going to show for that I put here the 

00:00:50.949 --> 00:00:56.229
 cartoon up that in the one of c's now 

00:00:53.319 --> 00:00:58.510
 Obviously, this is where the 

00:00:56.229 --> 00:01:01.329
 places the map is still missing 

00:00:58.510 --> 00:01:04.120
 go through all this that is transparent 

00:01:01.329 --> 00:01:05.530
 it is not so light blue in the sea ​​and 

00:01:04.120 --> 00:01:07.810
 these places until you get to the league 

00:01:05.530 --> 00:01:10.210
 pokemon but good 

00:01:07.810 --> 00:01:12.509
 of going to capture pokemon what are we going to 

00:01:10.210 --> 00:01:12.509
 do is 

00:01:12.530 --> 00:01:17.210
 let's train also if they have 

00:01:15.320 --> 00:01:19.970
 some idea of ​​how I can train the 

00:01:17.210 --> 00:01:22.610
 pokemon in this live, it's the 

00:01:19.970 --> 00:01:24.350
 I would really appreciate it because I do not know what 

00:01:22.610 --> 00:01:26.799
 do in fact only have battles 

00:01:24.350 --> 00:01:30.050
 It could be battles against 

00:01:26.799 --> 00:01:32.590
 coaches that if I remember correctly here 

00:01:30.050 --> 00:01:32.590
 they must be 

00:01:33.740 --> 00:01:38.030
 to see for example we 

00:01:35.240 --> 00:01:43.180
 we faced a girl who was by 

00:01:38.030 --> 00:01:47.689
 here route 114 was not on route 105 104 

00:01:43.180 --> 00:01:50.390
 104 yes I think we face it or 

00:01:47.689 --> 00:01:52.159
 we did not do it I'm not very sure but 

00:01:50.390 --> 00:01:53.330
 in one of the first chapters later 

00:01:52.159 --> 00:01:55.939
 to have the first medal 

00:01:53.330 --> 00:01:58.820
 I said if they wanted me to face me and 

00:01:55.939 --> 00:02:01.789
 look here this has a little more of 

00:01:58.820 --> 00:02:04.460
 heat let's continue to see this and the 

00:02:01.789 --> 00:02:07.520
 same route for example here there is only one 

00:02:04.460 --> 00:02:11.209
 and route 102 on route 103 are these 

00:02:07.520 --> 00:02:12.870
 two little girls because collector has and see 

00:02:11.209 --> 00:02:16.390
 such 

00:02:12.870 --> 00:02:18.340
 good freedom has the lady is 

00:02:16.390 --> 00:02:22.240
 here we can see all the pokémon that 

00:02:18.340 --> 00:02:25.150
 they appear to us virus has virus we are going to 

00:02:22.240 --> 00:02:28.870
 keep watching erico or I could 

00:02:25.150 --> 00:02:30.280
 face eric or what happened I'm not 

00:02:28.870 --> 00:02:32.830
 sure if I can face again 

00:02:30.280 --> 00:02:34.420
 to him because obviously I still do not have 

00:02:32.830 --> 00:02:37.330
 all the medals I announce all the 

00:02:34.420 --> 00:02:40.150
 clearly clear medals that I do have 

00:02:37.330 --> 00:02:43.060
 I just got all the medals and 

00:02:40.150 --> 00:02:45.070
 look, I remember these pokemon has been 

00:02:43.060 --> 00:02:46.550
 great all the blond pokemon adventure 

00:02:45.070 --> 00:02:49.220
 mega 

00:02:46.550 --> 00:02:51.500
 and in this place there is nobody or I think that 

00:02:49.220 --> 00:02:53.990
 from this place I said that I was going to 

00:02:51.500 --> 00:02:55.220
 make a ninja and that's why I do not face 

00:02:53.990 --> 00:02:57.320
 no one 

00:02:55.220 --> 00:02:59.120
 good good I want you to comment about 

00:02:57.320 --> 00:03:00.980
 of everything of everything in the all of everything of 

00:02:59.120 --> 00:03:03.620
 everything of everything 

00:03:00.980 --> 00:03:06.170
 what I just mentioned about the 

00:03:03.620 --> 00:03:09.530
 coaches training and that is 

00:03:06.170 --> 00:03:12.170
 he fought against them I go to the routes the 

00:03:09.530 --> 00:03:14.810
 routes that I listed ok would be 

00:03:12.170 --> 00:03:17.480
 the routes where are we going to go by 

00:03:14.810 --> 00:03:18.740
 here is the map is a bit slow better 

00:03:17.480 --> 00:03:21.320
 well faster 

00:03:18.740 --> 00:03:25.010
 here is the start at villa root this is 

00:03:21.320 --> 00:03:27.950
 route 101 103 ok and the first route 

00:03:25.010 --> 00:03:30.050
 it would be good the first place would be city 

00:03:27.950 --> 00:03:33.260
 petal because if you have noticed 

00:03:30.050 --> 00:03:36.500
 There are lakes, some small lakes and there 

00:03:33.260 --> 00:03:38.090
 we can fish surfing then I can 

00:03:36.500 --> 00:03:40.760
 capture some pokemon I do not know what because 

00:03:38.090 --> 00:03:41.960
 good they will appear there you can see it seems 

00:03:40.760 --> 00:03:43.760
 yes 

00:03:41.960 --> 00:03:46.730
 Let's see 

00:03:43.760 --> 00:03:50.120
 if 2p was saying or how cool is this 

00:03:46.730 --> 00:03:52.610
 the letter do not look they appear glam espion 

00:03:50.120 --> 00:03:55.730
 and hence this and I do not remember 

00:03:52.610 --> 00:03:58.459
 electros if electros because great and 

00:03:55.730 --> 00:04:01.220
 look at these pictures that are here are 

00:03:58.459 --> 00:04:03.200
 huge or they can also appear 

00:04:01.220 --> 00:04:05.420
 more pokemon apart from the ones that I just 

00:04:03.200 --> 00:04:08.030
 mention but I'm not sure why not 

00:04:05.420 --> 00:04:11.560
 I have all the pokédex then this town 

00:04:08.030 --> 00:04:13.870
 gold sea village place where is 

00:04:11.560 --> 00:04:15.930
 town by omar town I take again 

00:04:13.870 --> 00:04:18.060
 I think this is not 

00:04:15.930 --> 00:04:19.709
 clear and I can not see that pokemon 

00:04:18.060 --> 00:04:22.710
 they appear there because I have not visited that 

00:04:19.709 --> 00:04:25.770
 good place then there is the route number 

00:04:22.710 --> 00:04:28.530
 105 what would be this maritime route that 

00:04:25.770 --> 00:04:32.340
 you can see here the route number is long 

00:04:28.530 --> 00:04:33.870
 106 and no but on route number 106 there 

00:04:32.340 --> 00:04:35.689
 I got to capture some pokemon with the 

00:04:33.870 --> 00:04:38.989
 cane 

00:04:35.689 --> 00:04:40.639
 with what I think old I'm not sure 

00:04:38.989 --> 00:04:42.919
 so if you can watch the videos 

00:04:40.639 --> 00:04:45.349
 old ones and tell me why here I think that 

00:04:42.919 --> 00:04:48.709
 I got polygon I'm not sure in the 

00:04:45.349 --> 00:04:50.809
 route 107 or it was in town your list in a 

00:04:48.709 --> 00:04:54.079
 of these routes was but supposedly I 

00:04:50.809 --> 00:04:56.449
 missing capture pokemon here here in the 

00:04:54.079 --> 00:04:59.539
 route number 108 this so I did not go 

00:04:56.449 --> 00:05:01.909
 here also in mallow sea or this is a 

00:04:59.539 --> 00:05:03.799
 level completely good level I say a 

00:05:01.909 --> 00:05:06.889
 place where there are many trainers and 

00:05:03.799 --> 00:05:09.229
 many things I do not think they do much or 

00:05:06.889 --> 00:05:11.149
 be all this in the direct but 

00:05:09.229 --> 00:05:15.739
 I will try to do several things later 

00:05:11.149 --> 00:05:18.499
 are the routes number 109 115 that should 

00:05:15.739 --> 00:05:23.689
 be for the case I put 1 115 where 115 

00:05:18.499 --> 00:05:27.409
 here 118 117 ok 

00:05:23.689 --> 00:05:29.360
 I'm lost 116 to route 115 here 

00:05:27.409 --> 00:05:31.879
 there are also hidden coaches 

00:05:29.360 --> 00:05:33.369
 after the meteor cascade I remembered 

00:05:31.879 --> 00:05:37.339
 there are many places that I have skipped 

00:05:33.369 --> 00:05:40.369
 route 122 or maybe do several direct 

00:05:37.339 --> 00:05:44.479
 I 'm not sure the truth should be 

00:05:40.369 --> 00:05:48.139
 also videos does not rotate 122 route 123 that 

00:05:44.479 --> 00:05:52.999
 it's already good here is route 123 

00:05:48.139 --> 00:05:57.110
 where they are ok already and there I understood 125 128 

00:05:52.999 --> 00:05:59.360
 119 to 134 all those routes are missing 

00:05:57.110 --> 00:06:05.809
 capture pokemon here are the routes 

00:05:59.360 --> 00:06:07.459
 130 131 132 133 and the number 134 and then 

00:06:05.809 --> 00:06:10.579
 malva sea ​​as he also told me if I 

00:06:07.459 --> 00:06:12.709
 had said and well I also have the 

00:06:10.579 --> 00:06:14.149
 option to go capture legendary but 

00:06:12.709 --> 00:06:16.759
 I think that I'm going to leave it for the 

00:06:14.149 --> 00:06:17.689
 videos but for direct so I hope 

00:06:16.759 --> 00:06:19.819
 Do not miss it 

00:06:17.689 --> 00:06:22.519
 remember to be attentive to my twitter that 

00:06:19.819 --> 00:06:24.529
 there I always say if something happens because 

00:06:22.519 --> 00:06:26.809
 I had already mentioned that the live one was going to 

00:06:24.529 --> 00:06:29.209
 be today Tuesday but in the end as not 

00:06:26.809 --> 00:06:30.600
 warn in a video I said the best for the 

00:06:29.209 --> 00:06:34.470
 Friday 

00:06:30.600 --> 00:06:37.320
 the time will be between 4 and 5 o'clock 

00:06:34.470 --> 00:06:39.120
 the afternoon here now peru I'm going to 

00:06:37.320 --> 00:06:42.060
 leave the time in the description or such 

00:06:39.120 --> 00:06:44.280
 Once in the video I put it so I do not know 

00:06:42.060 --> 00:06:46.590
 Spain-Mexico in Mexico I think it's the 

00:06:44.280 --> 00:06:49.320
 same time as here in Peru than Chile 

00:06:46.590 --> 00:06:52.350
 which I think has two hours more than in 

00:06:49.320 --> 00:06:54.690
 Peru and other countries can be Argentine 

00:06:52.350 --> 00:06:57.960
 several there are several countries in other videos 

00:06:54.690 --> 00:07:00.420
 of warning and they told me to warn also 

00:06:57.960 --> 00:07:03.900
 but I recommend you look in a page 

00:07:00.420 --> 00:07:05.880
 so they are safe and know with 

00:07:03.900 --> 00:07:07.290
 respect to the time of good Peru this 

00:07:05.880 --> 00:07:09.810
 I would be everything I hope you liked it 

00:07:07.290 --> 00:07:11.670
 this little video although small 

00:07:09.810 --> 00:07:14.040
 It seems that it has not been much because they have 

00:07:11.670 --> 00:07:17.070
 spent like 8 minutes I think or something like that 

00:07:14.040 --> 00:07:19.170
 Well the point is that you do not miss it 

00:07:17.070 --> 00:07:21.030
 leave your likes share the video 

00:07:19.170 --> 00:07:23.010
 remember that you can follow me on twitter 

00:07:21.030 --> 00:07:25.380
 to be informed on facebook though 

00:07:23.010 --> 00:07:27.360
 lately on facebook they are not published 

00:07:25.380 --> 00:07:30.450
 the twitter messages I do not know why 

00:07:27.360 --> 00:07:31.860
 reason so pay more attention to twitter and 

00:07:30.450 --> 00:07:33.660
 just download the application that 

00:07:31.860 --> 00:07:35.560
 is in the description of the video and that 

00:07:33.660 --> 00:07:38.400
 it's all we see 

00:07:35.560 --> 00:07:38.400
 goes
