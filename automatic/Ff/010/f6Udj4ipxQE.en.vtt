00:00:33.390 --> 00:00:38.400
 they believed that it will replace mama hill 

00:00:36.449 --> 00:00:41.309
 botero and jairo alonso because mom had 

00:00:38.400 --> 00:00:43.019

 pibes 

00:00:57.829 --> 00:01:02.170
 the transmission followed 

00:01:00.250 --> 00:01:05.080
 it does not matter if the country is blank and 

00:01:02.170 --> 00:01:07.840
 black or in color if there is dictatorship in front 

00:01:05.080 --> 00:01:09.940
 national or democratic insecurity ni 

00:01:07.840 --> 00:01:12.670
 it does not even matter if bambuco was passed 

00:01:09.940 --> 00:01:18.120
 to reggaeton the queens are kept in 

00:01:12.670 --> 00:01:20.010
 his 90 60 90 smiling and virgins 

00:01:18.120 --> 00:01:24.840
 I wanted to go out to the street when the 

00:01:20.010 --> 00:01:29.190
 back colombia when the queen arrived 

00:01:24.840 --> 00:01:31.440
 to visit the site and sometimes when 

00:01:29.190 --> 00:01:33.570
 at that stage the queens had a 

00:01:31.440 --> 00:01:36.330
 category of public figures that the 

00:01:33.570 --> 00:01:38.820
 people wanted to go out and see and touch the 

00:01:36.330 --> 00:01:40.110
 people like the fishermen in shocked with 

00:01:38.820 --> 00:01:43.530
 the fishermen on the Atlantic coast 

00:01:40.110 --> 00:01:46.020
 joined the engines of cayucos for 

00:01:43.530 --> 00:01:48.270
 generate electricity to power the 

00:01:46.020 --> 00:01:50.940
 reigning keeping the world I also know 

00:01:48.270 --> 00:01:53.340
 that the mountain does not fire a shot of 

00:01:50.940 --> 00:01:55.920
 truth is peaceful the country goes because it was 

00:01:53.340 --> 00:01:58.440
 the culture of beauty was to see 

00:01:55.920 --> 00:02:00.450
 guainía against vaupés against the guajira 

00:01:58.440 --> 00:02:08.660
 against lying is against the 

00:02:00.450 --> 00:02:08.660
 rotating was a culture of the disa 

00:02:11.090 --> 00:02:18.930
 I remember a lot that it was always in May 

00:02:15.240 --> 00:02:21.900
 the miss universe and in November was miss 

00:02:18.930 --> 00:02:24.600
 Colombia and now we have at 19 

00:02:21.900 --> 00:02:26.820
 candidates together in front of you 

00:02:24.600 --> 00:02:29.310
 in the cameras absolutely everything in the 

00:02:26.820 --> 00:02:31.410
 I live everything was live there was no 

00:02:29.310 --> 00:02:34.620
 pre-recorded good that music will serve 

00:02:31.410 --> 00:02:38.220
 so that they begin to parade the 19 

00:02:34.620 --> 00:02:40.740
 girls starting with antioquia to not go 

00:02:38.220 --> 00:02:43.710
 to come out in disorder you have three 

00:02:40.740 --> 00:02:46.470
 I always looked rather lonely because 

00:02:43.710 --> 00:02:48.540
 my dad was not much to see reign me 

00:02:46.470 --> 00:02:50.940
 I was lazy about that pile of fruits in 

00:02:48.540 --> 00:02:54.660
 the head and all that thing but yes I 

00:02:50.940 --> 00:02:57.030
 liked to see the woman in dress year 

00:02:54.660 --> 00:02:58.590
 cool I saw it more for the 

00:02:57.030 --> 00:03:01.020
 custom that everyone saw it and 

00:02:58.590 --> 00:03:04.020
 besides, always afterwards the 

00:03:01.020 --> 00:03:05.580
 Another day you saw who won or saw good 

00:03:04.020 --> 00:03:07.260
 and it was great when they started 

00:03:05.580 --> 00:03:09.030
 put it of the scores of those of the 

00:03:07.260 --> 00:03:10.590
 scores and I can be funny because 

00:03:09.030 --> 00:03:12.180
 I always had the feeling that 

00:03:10.590 --> 00:03:13.830
 highest scores was never the one 

00:03:12.180 --> 00:03:15.480
 he won and that there was always a stick 

00:03:13.830 --> 00:03:17.220
 there was always a bold girl who was 

00:03:15.480 --> 00:03:20.220
 favorite part and won 1 

00:03:17.220 --> 00:03:22.380
 a caldense or one of the amazonía or not 

00:03:20.220 --> 00:03:23.880
 I know what but bold came to win in 

00:03:22.380 --> 00:03:26.430
 the last years but before there was no 

00:03:23.880 --> 00:03:27.690
 Bold winner is very racist this 

00:03:26.430 --> 00:03:30.770
 country 

00:03:27.690 --> 00:03:30.770
 tell the curtains 

00:03:32.270 --> 00:03:36.420
 of the multitudinous reception that 

00:03:35.070 --> 00:03:40.140
 caused the arrival as 'miss universe' 

00:03:36.420 --> 00:03:42.150
 of marine light zuluaga in 1958 to the 

00:03:40.140 --> 00:03:44.850
 emissions of the coronation evening of 

00:03:42.150 --> 00:03:46.830
 the 80s when hypnosis was such 

00:03:44.850 --> 00:03:48.900
 that produced in the country that this 

00:03:46.830 --> 00:03:52.050
 forgot in a week the tragedy of 

00:03:48.900 --> 00:03:54.330
 armorer or that of the courthouse is 

00:03:52.050 --> 00:03:57.000
 has gone to a quasi-indifference of the 

00:03:54.330 --> 00:03:59.490
 public where the most interesting thing is 

00:03:57.000 --> 00:04:03.370
 know what the worst response was 

00:03:59.490 --> 00:04:06.140
 candidates and to the past 

00:04:03.370 --> 00:04:10.220
 I do not remember who he said he was 

00:04:06.140 --> 00:04:12.349
 I would like to be born and die in Rome 

00:04:10.220 --> 00:04:15.080
 was where our birthplace was born and died 

00:04:12.349 --> 00:04:17.090
 Lord Jesus Christ, I would like to live that 

00:04:15.080 --> 00:04:19.910
 experience in my own flesh if I speak 

00:04:17.090 --> 00:04:22.790
 English a little bit and Cartagena 

00:04:19.910 --> 00:04:25.430
 hilton queen indeed we see that man 

00:04:22.790 --> 00:04:27.590
 with man of woman with woman and the same 

00:04:25.430 --> 00:04:29.960
 in the opposite direction is that in the type 

00:04:27.590 --> 00:04:32.810
 of peace in the general culture of 

00:04:29.960 --> 00:04:35.830
 rules that to me maybe that still I 

00:04:32.810 --> 00:04:40.160
 like to see it from atlantic and guajira 

00:04:35.830 --> 00:04:42.919
 I remember in the first 85 reign that I 

00:04:40.160 --> 00:04:48.280
 presented in life and there is a family 

00:04:42.919 --> 00:04:48.280
 that made me some faces and they told me 

00:04:48.630 --> 00:04:55.220
 It was the divinity of 

00:04:52.160 --> 00:04:56.780
 to have a role but the previous life 

00:04:55.220 --> 00:04:58.280
 dies the mónica area for mónica urbina 

00:04:56.780 --> 00:05:01.820
 María Mónica Urbina with these eyes 

00:04:58.280 --> 00:05:04.300
 yellow as like from divine panther the 

00:05:01.820 --> 00:05:04.300
 retinue 

00:05:04.760 --> 00:05:09.590
 Here, it is some wonder that 

00:05:07.220 --> 00:05:11.600
 truth is a raizal thing that's why it's the 

00:05:09.590 --> 00:05:14.510
 word because the national contest of 

00:05:11.600 --> 00:05:17.150
 beauty that touch the raizales fibers of 

00:05:14.510 --> 00:05:21.080
 you from your homeland where do you come from ? 

00:05:17.150 --> 00:05:23.150
 you understand your origins and that's why I 

00:05:21.080 --> 00:05:25.510
 I think it got where it came and will continue 

00:05:23.150 --> 00:05:25.510
 being 

00:05:28.030 --> 00:05:32.020
 see the reign of being a half morbid 

00:05:30.610 --> 00:05:35.950
 clear because you always want to see the 

00:05:32.020 --> 00:05:39.040
 pretty the ugliest the arranged one and the 

00:05:35.950 --> 00:05:40.540
 arrange it like that who makes a mistake 

00:05:39.040 --> 00:05:42.730
 That has some morbosidad the 

00:05:40.540 --> 00:05:48.630
 purple on the leg is it fell 

00:05:42.730 --> 00:05:53.140
 in the whaling boat whale 

00:05:48.630 --> 00:05:59.260

 public urbina the auditory resonates with 

00:06:03.730 --> 00:06:08.110
 the retinue the cries of the 

00:06:05.560 --> 00:06:10.240
 supporters of Miss Guajira that 

00:06:08.110 --> 00:06:11.680
