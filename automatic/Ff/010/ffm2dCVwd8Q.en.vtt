00:00:08.760 --> 00:00:13.990
 uk logistics in heart shape a video about 

00:00:11.680 --> 00:00:15.400
 call of the transporter again and again 

00:00:13.990 --> 00:00:18.310
 it's about all teams respectively 

00:00:15.400 --> 00:00:19.779
 weapons towers we have relatively many 

00:00:18.310 --> 00:00:21.009
 the inside because it is made of some things 

00:00:19.779 --> 00:00:22.810
 are the ones always as a point to 

00:00:21.009 --> 00:00:25.149
 example big to the operator of the park 

00:00:22.810 --> 00:00:27.999
 and now that they are towed as weapons 

00:00:25.149 --> 00:00:30.220
 So a lot of them first 

00:00:27.999 --> 00:00:32.170
 commission for the assault rifle da 

00:00:30.220 --> 00:00:33.640
 we have it serious acg scope than that 

00:00:32.170 --> 00:00:35.440
 very normal ag visor 

00:00:33.640 --> 00:00:37.210
 By the way, do not be surprised at the bottom left 

00:00:35.440 --> 00:00:39.310
 in the statistics you can almost see that 

00:00:37.210 --> 00:00:41.230
 the precision strong for the handling 

00:00:39.310 --> 00:00:42.820
 it will probably sink now 

00:00:41.230 --> 00:00:43.690
 do not say it will just look like this 

00:00:42.820 --> 00:00:45.460
 but I do not think that really 

00:00:43.690 --> 00:00:46.840
 So something about statistics is changing it 

00:00:45.460 --> 00:00:49.060
 It has never been so 

00:00:46.840 --> 00:00:50.830
 just how they are newer better 

00:00:49.060 --> 00:00:53.200
 thus has next now 

00:00:50.830 --> 00:00:54.579
 term of this is almost like his 

00:00:53.200 --> 00:00:56.920
 long run so that increases the 

00:00:54.579 --> 00:00:58.270
 reach the weapon now too 

00:00:56.920 --> 00:00:59.620
 I think the first time you buy this 

00:00:58.270 --> 00:01:01.960
 that you almost get your reach of 

00:00:59.620 --> 00:01:03.520
 I can still increase the size of a military rifle 

00:01:01.960 --> 00:01:04.869
 also curious how much that is useful and 

00:01:03.520 --> 00:01:05.829
 maybe that's definitely well 

00:01:04.869 --> 00:01:08.079
 a good statement 

00:01:05.829 --> 00:01:09.399
 after that, you were always seen so 

00:01:08.079 --> 00:01:10.090
 I had the last time with the perks me 

00:01:09.399 --> 00:01:12.130
 We wondered that we did not 

00:01:10.090 --> 00:01:13.240
 Finger skills we get then 

00:01:12.130 --> 00:01:15.520
 But I have the tennis- 

00:01:13.240 --> 00:01:17.200
 looked at and there is the double 

00:01:15.520 --> 00:01:19.479
 magazine quasi and with what the actors 

00:01:17.200 --> 00:01:20.619
 can load and the quasi the now 

00:01:19.479 --> 00:01:23.439
 Finger skill replacement 

00:01:20.619 --> 00:01:24.579
 then have the anticipation or handle it 

00:01:23.439 --> 00:01:25.539
 you just have a higher precision 

00:01:24.579 --> 00:01:27.609
 when shooting 

00:01:25.539 --> 00:01:29.889
 the laser time so you have one 

00:01:27.609 --> 00:01:30.909
 higher precision that already in black 

00:01:29.889 --> 00:01:33.399
 ops was like that 

00:01:30.909 --> 00:01:35.049
 then you have the lightweight grip that 

00:01:33.399 --> 00:01:37.060
 is very fast grip so handle it 

00:01:35.049 --> 00:01:38.889
 you can use it faster in the scope 

00:01:37.060 --> 00:01:41.829
 is now that will draw quickly 

00:01:38.889 --> 00:01:43.990
 and in the night race stock so the quasi 

00:01:41.829 --> 00:01:45.189
 somehow get it out of 24 with it 

00:01:43.990 --> 00:01:47.289
 can run faster in the visor 

00:01:45.189 --> 00:01:49.569
 afterwards a completely new attachment 

00:01:47.289 --> 00:01:50.770
 namely that perry bollig microphone and 

00:01:49.569 --> 00:01:52.810
 yes this is a touchpad that makes it possible 

00:01:50.770 --> 00:01:54.429
 make that you see opponents on the map 

00:01:52.810 --> 00:01:55.929
 So that you are almost at the top 

00:01:54.429 --> 00:01:57.429
 if those are silenced 

00:01:55.929 --> 00:01:58.599
 weapons will shoot so naturally 

00:01:57.429 --> 00:02:00.520
 otherwise not indicated but if you 

00:01:58.599 --> 00:02:02.979
 this parabolic microphone on yours 

00:02:00.520 --> 00:02:04.569
 weapon then it suddenly becomes 

00:02:02.979 --> 00:02:06.279
 strengthened under the cd then no more 

00:02:04.569 --> 00:02:07.569
 on the map it is definitely right 

00:02:06.279 --> 00:02:09.670
 interesting attachment so I am 

00:02:07.569 --> 00:02:11.080
 really curious if so 

00:02:09.670 --> 00:02:12.940
 whether that is often used, whether that's good 

00:02:11.080 --> 00:02:14.650
 is because I do not even know if that 

00:02:12.940 --> 00:02:16.150
 peel for facebook ever so often 

00:02:14.650 --> 00:02:18.190
 will be played because it is one 

00:02:16.150 --> 00:02:20.110
 relatively new gameplay and so on 

00:02:18.190 --> 00:02:21.790
 yes in any case, there is then 

00:02:20.110 --> 00:02:23.170
 this essay was a bit 

00:02:21.790 --> 00:02:24.550
 that it is an essay and that is not 

00:02:23.170 --> 00:02:26.830
 Mountain is because I actually think that 

00:02:24.550 --> 00:02:28.540
 he was such a castle thing but for everyone 

00:02:26.830 --> 00:02:30.100
 case that here and weapons tower like that 

00:02:28.540 --> 00:02:30.910
 that after that rapid fire this time too 

00:02:30.100 --> 00:02:32.500
 I believe for the first time 

00:02:30.910 --> 00:02:35.080
 storm rifles, so to speak, faster 

00:02:32.500 --> 00:02:36.250
 scores the weather time something like this one 

00:02:35.080 --> 00:02:37.720
 looks a little different is one 

00:02:36.250 --> 00:02:40.300
 little vertical is not so in 

00:02:37.720 --> 00:02:42.250
 the width is what but think synonymous 

00:02:40.300 --> 00:02:43.630
 I'm a very good visor then 

00:02:42.250 --> 00:02:44.920
 So you take the press so the muffler 

00:02:43.630 --> 00:02:47.080
 that they are quasi when you finally get up 

00:02:44.920 --> 00:02:49.060
 the map will be displayed as 

00:02:47.080 --> 00:02:50.350
 next the target a window and that 

00:02:49.060 --> 00:02:51.670
 is also a new one as it is 

00:02:50.350 --> 00:02:53.770
 relatively similar to the millimeter 

00:02:51.670 --> 00:02:56.170
 this millimeter likes to get away from 2 

00:02:53.770 --> 00:02:58.240
 So it marks quasi opponents at 

00:02:56.170 --> 00:02:59.530
 so you are in sight are so too 

00:02:58.240 --> 00:03:01.690
 run through the visor with you 

00:02:59.530 --> 00:03:05.020
 I mean that marchetti so red and so 

00:03:01.690 --> 00:03:07.270
 yes, I'm also curious if that one 

00:03:05.020 --> 00:03:09.550
 bit in the superstar goal or goes 

00:03:07.270 --> 00:03:10.840
 that says more like the millimeter is included 

00:03:09.550 --> 00:03:13.330
 The thing was definitely pretty 

00:03:10.840 --> 00:03:14.680
 overboard but this team appreciates itself 

00:03:13.330 --> 00:03:17.140
 so exuberant because it not as a 

00:03:14.680 --> 00:03:19.210
 extreme reach has still the one 

00:03:17.140 --> 00:03:20.380
 theme as she is that looks now 

00:03:19.210 --> 00:03:21.460
 also a little different from sitting 

00:03:20.380 --> 00:03:23.890
 yes, a bit because it is 

00:03:21.460 --> 00:03:25.840
 in the script so there is the opponent 

00:03:23.890 --> 00:03:27.010
 Although very red marked but it is 

00:03:25.840 --> 00:03:28.420
 Still not that good I would 

00:03:27.010 --> 00:03:30.490
 say because it is also relatively strong always 

00:03:28.420 --> 00:03:31.390
 purely for it's hard to overview 

00:03:30.490 --> 00:03:32.440
 to keep 

00:03:31.390 --> 00:03:34.270
 This process is not that extreme either 

00:03:32.440 --> 00:03:36.100
 be strong so then comes the next one 

00:03:34.270 --> 00:03:37.540
 Statement of the trekkers and that is here 

00:03:36.100 --> 00:03:39.160
 no visor but it is almost like a 

00:03:37.540 --> 00:03:40.570
 laser pointer that you turn down 

00:03:39.160 --> 00:03:42.610
 and that's sort of like 

00:03:40.570 --> 00:03:44.440
 on gamepro in mw3 so if your opponent 

00:03:42.610 --> 00:03:46.210
 So, if you're injured, shoot 

00:03:44.440 --> 00:03:47.680
 then those on your mini map 

00:03:46.210 --> 00:03:48.760
 so i do not know if for that 

00:03:47.680 --> 00:03:49.900
 probably not all the time though 

00:03:48.760 --> 00:03:52.450
 then they would definitely be a while 

00:03:49.900 --> 00:03:53.470
 on the minimap indicated that on each 

00:03:52.450 --> 00:03:55.300
 also quite useful if you are 

00:03:53.470 --> 00:03:56.560
 He stopped someone but then runs away 

00:03:55.300 --> 00:03:58.930
 but then you know exactly what it is 

00:03:56.560 --> 00:04:00.550
 So, yes, so it will certainly be 

00:03:58.930 --> 00:04:02.260
 relatively useful and then as 

00:04:00.550 --> 00:04:05.050
 the final test for the story drive is this 

00:04:02.260 --> 00:04:06.580
 variable rescuer time so that's one 

00:04:05.050 --> 00:04:08.319
 kind of hybrid visor somehow can then 

00:04:06.580 --> 00:04:10.720
 almost always the zoom levels change 

00:04:08.319 --> 00:04:12.760
 So he discussed in record time with him 

00:04:10.720 --> 00:04:14.500
 would also like to ran zoom what can yes 

00:04:12.760 --> 00:04:15.970
 also you could use it but i would 

00:04:14.500 --> 00:04:17.470
 it confuses you more if you always have that 

00:04:15.970 --> 00:04:18.639
 Therefore, it must recommend again 

00:04:17.470 --> 00:04:20.060
 I usually usually do 

00:04:18.639 --> 00:04:21.560
 the normal weather time 

00:04:20.060 --> 00:04:23.690
 then all the titles of 

00:04:21.560 --> 00:04:25.070
 the service through im sms is there 

00:04:23.690 --> 00:04:27.410
 now no new topics but also 

00:04:25.070 --> 00:04:28.490
 the but at a saw reunion are in 

00:04:27.410 --> 00:04:30.020
 my guns are still a few 

00:04:28.490 --> 00:04:31.669
 new things and indeed there are first 

00:04:30.020 --> 00:04:34.310
 kimbo so you can guns, so to speak 

00:04:31.669 --> 00:04:35.480
 take macro mode again yes that was there 

00:04:34.310 --> 00:04:36.980
 yes, always a headscarf so far 

00:04:35.480 --> 00:04:39.230
 then you got used to it already 

00:04:36.980 --> 00:04:41.900
 and then also the tactical knife 

00:04:39.230 --> 00:04:43.190
 which was already very common then 

00:04:41.900 --> 00:04:45.440
 Teams always had his knife with them 

00:04:43.190 --> 00:04:47.000
 but otherwise really new things are there 

00:04:45.440 --> 00:04:48.620
 but you can not really 

00:04:47.000 --> 00:04:50.000
 many like yours on your guns 

00:04:48.620 --> 00:04:51.410
 do it otherwise it was actually 

00:04:50.000 --> 00:04:52.970
 It is rare to see so many on it 

00:04:51.410 --> 00:04:54.290
 but you could do days here too 

00:04:52.970 --> 00:04:56.360
 the traders can do all the things 

00:04:54.290 --> 00:04:57.620
 So also in the value this time you will be synonymous 

00:04:56.360 --> 00:04:59.240
 stop more like yours on the pistol 

00:04:57.620 --> 00:05:00.950
 can do so then we come to the 

00:04:59.240 --> 00:05:02.540
 sniper as I have panels of the now 

00:05:00.950 --> 00:05:03.800
 Unfortunately, no picture to at least no 

00:05:02.540 --> 00:05:05.540
 sharp picture somehow I have only like that 

00:05:03.800 --> 00:05:06.260
 bad low resolution pictures 

00:05:05.540 --> 00:05:07.940
 found 

00:05:06.260 --> 00:05:09.979
 but he definitely precludes you 

00:05:07.940 --> 00:05:11.840
 what things in it are first 

00:05:09.979 --> 00:05:13.790
 have again the cheapest bio so im 

00:05:11.840 --> 00:05:15.889
 ballistic processor will also be back 

00:05:13.790 --> 00:05:17.389
 have the effect that here less around 

00:05:15.889 --> 00:05:19.700
 wiggles in the pub if you are in the 

00:05:17.389 --> 00:05:21.860
 script since and yes so like the song 

00:05:19.700 --> 00:05:23.600
 black ops walter as was also the 

00:05:21.860 --> 00:05:25.520
 ironside so that you the sniper with 

00:05:23.600 --> 00:05:27.050
 This could be my time 

00:05:25.520 --> 00:05:28.460
 you too know for all the snipers in 

00:05:27.050 --> 00:05:30.229
 black ops map was it only for the 

00:05:28.460 --> 00:05:32.180
 ball but are just here's the 

00:05:30.229 --> 00:05:33.320
 I think for all sniper then there is 

00:05:32.180 --> 00:05:34.460
 By the way, with the snipers as well 

00:05:33.320 --> 00:05:35.570
 I already mentioned that but it did 

00:05:34.460 --> 00:05:36.770
 you have to say it again that's it 

00:05:35.570 --> 00:05:38.090
 also really for this results the 

00:05:36.770 --> 00:05:39.620
 so fastest you can do it 

00:05:38.090 --> 00:05:41.240
 already half in the fast access 

00:05:39.620 --> 00:05:43.700
 because now many people are playing too 

00:05:41.240 --> 00:05:45.500
 asked if you are this if you want the 

00:05:43.700 --> 00:05:47.330
 rhine schopen but not accelerate 

00:05:45.500 --> 00:05:48.710
 can where there is no mountain for so 

00:05:47.330 --> 00:05:50.570
 there are extra again now a tower 

00:05:48.710 --> 00:05:51.800
 for the sniper with her quasi faster 

00:05:50.570 --> 00:05:53.720
 the scope will probably come then 

00:05:51.800 --> 00:05:55.160
 everyone will use yes then last 

00:05:53.720 --> 00:05:56.630
 there is still the variable with the sniper 

00:05:55.160 --> 00:05:58.220
 so that we almost between 

00:05:56.630 --> 00:05:59.300
 choose different zoom levels 

00:05:58.220 --> 00:06:01.340
 can always be like that 

00:05:59.300 --> 00:06:02.690
 already the call of duty sofa so that were 

00:06:01.340 --> 00:06:04.970
 now also all essays for all weapons 

00:06:02.690 --> 00:06:06.229
 groups that are relatively many essays 

00:06:04.970 --> 00:06:07.610
 and really essays are the 

00:06:06.229 --> 00:06:08.990
 most important and otherwise as a project 

00:06:07.610 --> 00:06:10.460
 I could imagine being used 

00:06:08.990 --> 00:06:11.930
 that it is really frequent in 

00:06:10.460 --> 00:06:13.550
 advanced server are used so that 

00:06:11.930 --> 00:06:14.780
 Also often three towers are used 

00:06:13.550 --> 00:06:16.520
 with the wildcard because there is yes 

00:06:14.780 --> 00:06:19.520
 really in pretty strong towers and 

00:06:16.520 --> 00:06:21.919
 something like the stock so to speak 

00:06:19.520 --> 00:06:23.240
 the lightweight stock needs such things 

00:06:21.919 --> 00:06:24.560
 You usually always 

00:06:23.240 --> 00:06:26.060
 used as that is always beautiful 

00:06:24.560 --> 00:06:27.900
 standard essays or two others 

00:06:26.060 --> 00:06:29.160
 You also usually need essays 

00:06:27.900 --> 00:06:30.750
 That's why we can really imagine 

00:06:29.160 --> 00:06:32.580
 that you often get the wildcard for the 

00:06:30.750 --> 00:06:34.139
 Towers will be used in any case 

00:06:32.580 --> 00:06:35.850
 interested in what essays you believe 

00:06:34.139 --> 00:06:36.630
 become the strongest or the most 

00:06:35.850 --> 00:06:38.100
 be used 

00:06:36.630 --> 00:06:40.289
 I'm really looking forward to the 

00:06:38.100 --> 00:06:41.490
 target a dealer so if yes me 

00:06:40.289 --> 00:06:42.720
 would always be a bit more critical 

00:06:41.490 --> 00:06:44.789
 to do such things purely but I hope 

00:06:42.720 --> 00:06:46.560
 that they just keep it balanced 

00:06:44.789 --> 00:06:48.150
 and with that, that's us too 

00:06:46.560 --> 00:06:49.889
 already over I hope that such 

00:06:48.150 --> 00:06:51.449
 I liked it again 

00:06:49.889 --> 00:06:54.020
 which myself after that for joy that 

00:06:51.449 --> 00:06:54.020
 it was for today
