00:00:02.230 --> 00:00:06.710
 when you get past the architecture TGS area you burn almost always 

00:00:06.710 --> 00:00:07.280
 light 

00:00:07.280 --> 00:00:09.099
 even if it is already late 

00:00:09.099 --> 00:00:12.129
 as I fully consciously eat 4 8 percent 

00:00:12.129 --> 00:00:14.729
 and that's my neighbor, too 

00:00:14.729 --> 00:00:17.729
 it's just as fast as I'm fit again it's pretty tough though 

00:00:18.529 --> 00:00:21.529
 but fun 

00:00:22.189 --> 00:00:23.769
 right in the first semester 

00:00:23.769 --> 00:00:27.529
 Bitkom RA corpse take-two students a crash with lamp and chair and 

00:00:27.529 --> 00:00:30.520
 After only a few weeks, the workplaces in the studio will be visible 

00:00:30.520 --> 00:00:32.510
 really looking for work 

00:00:32.510 --> 00:00:35.320
 then the workplace becomes living space and the species like that 

00:00:35.320 --> 00:00:38.800
 Community of students so extended families 

00:00:38.800 --> 00:00:42.470
 The most important work of architecture students is the design and 

00:00:42.470 --> 00:00:46.890
 Architectural designs cost a lot of time and nerves Steffi already has 

00:00:46.890 --> 00:00:51.490
 determined that is a team easier county Viersen Kleve goes a flag 

00:00:51.490 --> 00:00:54.490
 Staying rehearsal because it's easier when you put it all together 

00:00:56.060 --> 00:00:59.060
 a co-worker stay added 

00:00:59.950 --> 00:01:02.970
 The study of architecture requires a lot of commitment 

00:01:02.970 --> 00:01:06.760
 Above all, the work of designing for what the model making but also belongs 

00:01:06.760 --> 00:01:09.470
 original actions for the study program throughout the city 

00:01:09.470 --> 00:01:11.950
 notorious East 

00:01:11.950 --> 00:01:13.530
 Mayor Abba 

00:01:13.530 --> 00:01:14.610
 adventure 

00:01:14.610 --> 00:01:18.200
 that the government only ceased the Cottbus state theater 

00:01:18.200 --> 00:01:22.290
 Light installation by the students and ripped and realized 

00:01:27.190 --> 00:01:29.200
 the project therefore pirates 

00:01:29.200 --> 00:01:32.939
 the students modified a place in the middle of the city center for a tooth 

00:01:32.939 --> 00:01:35.939
 want with a few kilometers 

00:01:44.240 --> 00:01:46.049
 but the architecture students 

00:01:46.049 --> 00:01:48.270
 need to learn a lot of basics 

00:01:48.270 --> 00:01:51.480
 Theories and technique that will be conveyed in the lectures 

00:02:06.400 --> 00:02:08.969
 Nevertheless, Steffi manages to operate competitive sports 

00:02:08.969 --> 00:02:13.400
 At the bmx-rad she will be at the very top of the discipline in Germany 

00:02:13.399 --> 00:02:17.120
 recently she has won the German championship in 2008 and on the 

00:02:17.119 --> 00:02:19.459
 Way extra second place 

00:02:19.459 --> 00:02:23.200
 Unfortunately, the training plan sometimes has the many obligations of studying something 

00:02:23.200 --> 00:02:24.109
 after 

00:02:24.109 --> 00:02:26.219
 or the other way around 

00:02:26.219 --> 00:02:29.639
 In this very important to me Lhasa Spartak count the mini men 

00:02:29.639 --> 00:02:31.289
 friendly 

00:02:31.289 --> 00:02:34.999
 Of course, he studies or studies this study to be optimal for me and 

00:02:35.679 --> 00:02:39.949
 for the also super of 12 both Steffi not only at the Bike Expo and but 

00:02:39.949 --> 00:02:43.409
 always turn around for every few laps and get a goal
