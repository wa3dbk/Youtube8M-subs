they aren't going to give you one per
card<00:00:53.160> which<00:00:54.149> could<00:00:54.510> cause<00:00:54.870> a<00:00:54.899> little<00:00:55.170> issue

00:00:55.729 --> 00:00:55.739 
card which could cause a little issue

00:00:55.739 --> 00:00:58.580 
card which could cause a little issue
before<00:00:56.250> the<00:00:56.579> movie<00:00:56.969> so<00:00:57.719> that's<00:00:57.899> interesting

00:00:58.580 --> 00:00:58.590 
before the movie so that's interesting

00:00:58.590 --> 00:01:00.110 
before the movie so that's interesting
