hi this rich with workshop adhikam today
we're<00:00:10.920> going<00:00:11.040> to<00:00:11.100> take<00:00:11.250> a<00:00:11.280> look<00:00:11.490> at<00:00:11.610> the<00:00:11.700> miter

00:00:11.869 --> 00:00:11.879 
we're going to take a look at the miter

00:00:11.879 --> 00:00:14.240 
we're going to take a look at the miter
gauge<00:00:11.969> setup<00:00:12.570> in<00:00:12.719> my<00:00:12.750> table<00:00:13.049> saw<00:00:13.379> I<00:00:13.709> have<00:00:14.160> an

00:00:14.240 --> 00:00:14.250 
gauge setup in my table saw I have an

00:00:14.250 --> 00:00:17.390 
gauge setup in my table saw I have an
anchor<00:00:14.490> a<00:00:14.670> mitre<00:00:15.000> Express<00:00:15.570> sled<00:00:16.020> and<00:00:16.379> a<00:00:16.949> anchor

00:00:17.390 --> 00:00:17.400 
anchor a mitre Express sled and a anchor

anchor a mitre Express sled and a anchor
1000<00:00:18.270> HDD<00:00:18.810> miter<00:00:19.050> gauge<00:00:19.380> the<00:00:20.220> reason<00:00:20.550> I<00:00:20.670> chose

00:00:20.900 --> 00:00:20.910 
1000 HDD miter gauge the reason I chose

00:00:20.910 --> 00:00:24.230 
1000 HDD miter gauge the reason I chose
this<00:00:21.240> combo<00:00:21.750> over<00:00:22.170> the<00:00:22.260> 5000<00:00:23.130> plus<00:00:23.369> it's<00:00:23.970> got<00:00:24.210> a

00:00:24.230 --> 00:00:24.240 
this combo over the 5000 plus it's got a

00:00:24.240 --> 00:00:26.749 
this combo over the 5000 plus it's got a
slightly<00:00:24.689> smaller<00:00:25.169> sled<00:00:25.769> on<00:00:25.800> it<00:00:26.279> I<00:00:26.429> didn't

00:00:26.749 --> 00:00:26.759 
slightly smaller sled on it I didn't

00:00:26.759 --> 00:00:29.450 
slightly smaller sled on it I didn't
need<00:00:26.880> the<00:00:27.060> exercise<00:00:27.480> but<00:00:28.470> more<00:00:28.859> importantly<00:00:29.369> I

00:00:29.450 --> 00:00:29.460 
need the exercise but more importantly I

00:00:29.460 --> 00:00:32.960 
need the exercise but more importantly I
wanted<00:00:29.939> the<00:00:30.089> 1000<00:00:30.869> Hz<00:00:31.380> unit<00:00:31.890> which<00:00:32.430> is

00:00:32.960 --> 00:00:32.970 
wanted the 1000 Hz unit which is

00:00:32.970 --> 00:00:35.900 
wanted the 1000 Hz unit which is
high-definition<00:00:33.329> and<00:00:34.400> by<00:00:35.400> that<00:00:35.640> I<00:00:35.670> mean

00:00:35.900 --> 00:00:35.910 
high-definition and by that I mean

00:00:35.910 --> 00:00:39.650 
high-definition and by that I mean
there's<00:00:36.360> a<00:00:36.420> hundred<00:00:36.930> and<00:00:37.230> eighty<00:00:38.030> laser<00:00:39.030> cut

00:00:39.650 --> 00:00:39.660 
there's a hundred and eighty laser cut

00:00:39.660 --> 00:00:42.380 
there's a hundred and eighty laser cut
teeth<00:00:40.260> on<00:00:40.560> this<00:00:40.800> thing<00:00:41.010> compared<00:00:41.490> to<00:00:41.610> 41<00:00:42.180> on

00:00:42.380 --> 00:00:42.390 
teeth on this thing compared to 41 on

00:00:42.390 --> 00:00:44.060 
teeth on this thing compared to 41 on
the<00:00:42.540> other<00:00:42.660> models<00:00:43.140> so<00:00:43.260> I<00:00:43.320> can<00:00:43.560> lock<00:00:43.770> this

00:00:44.060 --> 00:00:44.070 
the other models so I can lock this

00:00:44.070 --> 00:00:46.820 
the other models so I can lock this
thing<00:00:44.130> down<00:00:44.400> every<00:00:45.180> degree<00:00:45.360> it<00:00:46.320> also<00:00:46.470> has<00:00:46.800> a

00:00:46.820 --> 00:00:46.830 
thing down every degree it also has a

00:00:46.830 --> 00:00:49.190 
thing down every degree it also has a
little<00:00:47.190> dial<00:00:47.430> here<00:00:47.580> on<00:00:47.910> the<00:00:48.090> back<00:00:48.270> that<00:00:49.050> will

00:00:49.190 --> 00:00:49.200 
little dial here on the back that will

00:00:49.200 --> 00:00:52.250 
little dial here on the back that will
allow<00:00:49.560> you<00:00:49.620> to<00:00:50.210> fine-tune<00:00:51.210> it<00:00:51.630> down<00:00:51.810> to<00:00:51.990> one

00:00:52.250 --> 00:00:52.260 
allow you to fine-tune it down to one

00:00:52.260 --> 00:00:54.680 
allow you to fine-tune it down to one
tenth<00:00:52.590> of<00:00:52.740> a<00:00:52.890> degree<00:00:53.040> but<00:00:53.910> to<00:00:54.060> be<00:00:54.150> honest<00:00:54.540> I

00:00:54.680 --> 00:00:54.690 
tenth of a degree but to be honest I

00:00:54.690 --> 00:00:57.110 
tenth of a degree but to be honest I
find<00:00:54.900> it<00:00:55.080> very<00:00:55.110> confusing<00:00:55.530> to<00:00:56.130> use<00:00:56.370> and<00:00:56.730> and<00:00:56.910> I

00:00:57.110 --> 00:00:57.120 
find it very confusing to use and and I

00:00:57.120 --> 00:00:59.570 
find it very confusing to use and and I
never<00:00:57.360> do<00:00:57.800> one<00:00:58.800> of<00:00:58.890> the<00:00:58.980> nice<00:00:59.160> things<00:00:59.430> about

00:00:59.570 --> 00:00:59.580 
never do one of the nice things about

00:00:59.580 --> 00:01:04.329 
never do one of the nice things about
Ankara<00:01:00.240> is<00:01:01.190> they<00:01:02.190> have<00:01:02.430> expanding<00:01:03.420> rings<00:01:03.840> in

00:01:04.329 --> 00:01:04.339 
Ankara is they have expanding rings in

00:01:04.339 --> 00:01:09.530 
Ankara is they have expanding rings in
there<00:01:05.689> for<00:01:06.689> your<00:01:06.810> slots<00:01:07.170> so<00:01:08.540> traditionally

00:01:09.530 --> 00:01:09.540 
there for your slots so traditionally

00:01:09.540 --> 00:01:12.020 
there for your slots so traditionally
the<00:01:09.780> old<00:01:09.960> craftsman's<00:01:10.740> were<00:01:10.950> extra<00:01:11.549> tightened

00:01:12.020 --> 00:01:12.030 
the old craftsman's were extra tightened

00:01:12.030 --> 00:01:14.599 
the old craftsman's were extra tightened
you<00:01:12.149> couldn't<00:01:12.479> get<00:01:12.659> a<00:01:12.740> lot<00:01:13.740> of<00:01:13.859> tools<00:01:14.130> in<00:01:14.549> that

00:01:14.599 --> 00:01:14.609 
you couldn't get a lot of tools in that

00:01:14.609 --> 00:01:17.569 
you couldn't get a lot of tools in that
slot<00:01:15.210> well<00:01:15.929> this<00:01:16.079> allows<00:01:16.259> you<00:01:16.679> to<00:01:16.710> do<00:01:16.979> that<00:01:17.219> and

00:01:17.569 --> 00:01:17.579 
slot well this allows you to do that and

00:01:17.579 --> 00:01:19.580 
slot well this allows you to do that and
then<00:01:18.149> you<00:01:18.299> just<00:01:18.359> put<00:01:18.719> an<00:01:18.810> allen<00:01:19.170> wrench<00:01:19.229> in

00:01:19.580 --> 00:01:19.590 
then you just put an allen wrench in

00:01:19.590 --> 00:01:22.370 
then you just put an allen wrench in
there<00:01:19.770> and<00:01:19.920> it<00:01:19.979> expands<00:01:20.609> that<00:01:20.939> ring<00:01:21.390> and<00:01:21.719> it

00:01:22.370 --> 00:01:22.380 
there and it expands that ring and it

00:01:22.380 --> 00:01:24.830 
there and it expands that ring and it
tailors<00:01:23.069> these<00:01:23.399> things<00:01:23.819> to<00:01:24.030> fit<00:01:24.270> perfectly

00:01:24.830 --> 00:01:24.840 
tailors these things to fit perfectly

00:01:24.840 --> 00:01:27.800 
tailors these things to fit perfectly
and<00:01:25.350> slide<00:01:25.799> perfectly<00:01:26.189> in<00:01:26.880> your<00:01:26.939> in<00:01:27.749> your

00:01:27.800 --> 00:01:27.810 
and slide perfectly in your in your

00:01:27.810 --> 00:01:30.709 
and slide perfectly in your in your
slots<00:01:28.439> you<00:01:29.369> got<00:01:29.549> a<00:01:29.579> table<00:01:29.819> saw<00:01:30.149> that's<00:01:30.420> got<00:01:30.630> an

00:01:30.709 --> 00:01:30.719 
slots you got a table saw that's got an

00:01:30.719 --> 00:01:33.230 
slots you got a table saw that's got an
old<00:01:30.899> worn<00:01:31.289> out<00:01:31.439> slot<00:01:31.890> in<00:01:32.130> it<00:01:32.249> and<00:01:32.490> no<00:01:33.090> matter

00:01:33.230 --> 00:01:33.240 
old worn out slot in it and no matter

00:01:33.240 --> 00:01:35.389 
old worn out slot in it and no matter
what<00:01:33.450> you<00:01:33.600> put<00:01:33.630> in<00:01:33.960> it<00:01:34.140> it's<00:01:34.380> sloppy<00:01:34.649> these

00:01:35.389 --> 00:01:35.399 
what you put in it it's sloppy these

00:01:35.399 --> 00:01:38.090 
what you put in it it's sloppy these
things<00:01:35.670> will<00:01:35.909> tighten<00:01:36.630> it<00:01:36.749> up<00:01:36.869> so<00:01:37.229> I<00:01:37.530> like<00:01:38.069> that

00:01:38.090 --> 00:01:38.100 
things will tighten it up so I like that

00:01:38.100 --> 00:01:43.700 
things will tighten it up so I like that
a<00:01:38.310> lot<00:01:38.579> the<00:01:40.249> increment<00:01:41.249> of<00:01:41.340> gauge<00:01:42.679> you<00:01:43.679> can

00:01:43.700 --> 00:01:43.710 
a lot the increment of gauge you can

00:01:43.710 --> 00:01:46.459 
a lot the increment of gauge you can
extend<00:01:44.460> this<00:01:44.670> out<00:01:44.880> to<00:01:45.240> 31<00:01:45.929> inches

00:01:46.459 --> 00:01:46.469 
extend this out to 31 inches

00:01:46.469 --> 00:01:50.059 
extend this out to 31 inches
you<00:01:46.770> got<00:01:46.950> a<00:01:46.979> flip<00:01:47.340> stop<00:01:47.700> which<00:01:48.569> I<00:01:48.990> have<00:01:49.439> a<00:01:49.469> solid

00:01:50.059 --> 00:01:50.069 
you got a flip stop which I have a solid

00:01:50.069 --> 00:01:52.789 
you got a flip stop which I have a solid
bar<00:01:50.280> in<00:01:50.520> now<00:01:50.819> but<00:01:51.630> you<00:01:51.719> can<00:01:51.899> take<00:01:52.109> that<00:01:52.139> out<00:01:52.530> it

00:01:52.789 --> 00:01:52.799 
bar in now but you can take that out it

00:01:52.799 --> 00:01:55.249 
bar in now but you can take that out it
comes<00:01:52.950> with<00:01:53.249> two<00:01:53.429> short<00:01:53.759> bars<00:01:54.060> and<00:01:54.450> end<00:01:55.049> up

00:01:55.249 --> 00:01:55.259 
comes with two short bars and end up

00:01:55.259 --> 00:01:57.739 
comes with two short bars and end up
with<00:01:55.850> adjust<00:01:56.850> these<00:01:57.030> things<00:01:57.299> so<00:01:57.479> you've<00:01:57.630> got

00:01:57.739 --> 00:01:57.749 
with adjust these things so you've got

00:01:57.749 --> 00:02:00.739 
with adjust these things so you've got
two<00:01:57.959> different<00:01:58.109> stops<00:01:58.590> of<00:01:58.950> want<00:01:59.249> to<00:01:59.569> move<00:02:00.569> your

00:02:00.739 --> 00:02:00.749 
two different stops of want to move your

00:02:00.749 --> 00:02:03.230 
two different stops of want to move your
board<00:02:00.990> across<00:02:01.259> and<00:02:01.740> make<00:02:02.280> a<00:02:02.310> cut<00:02:02.609> and<00:02:02.880> flip<00:02:03.209> it

00:02:03.230 --> 00:02:03.240 
board across and make a cut and flip it

00:02:03.240 --> 00:02:04.310 
board across and make a cut and flip it
up<00:02:03.509> and<00:02:03.779> then<00:02:03.899> hit

00:02:04.310 --> 00:02:04.320 
up and then hit

00:02:04.320 --> 00:02:06.770 
up and then hit
one<00:02:04.530> you<00:02:05.070> can<00:02:05.280> do<00:02:05.790> that<00:02:06.030> as<00:02:06.180> well<00:02:06.330> so<00:02:06.660> that's

00:02:06.770 --> 00:02:06.780 
one you can do that as well so that's

00:02:06.780 --> 00:02:08.090 
one you can do that as well so that's
that's<00:02:07.170> really<00:02:07.590> nice

00:02:08.090 --> 00:02:08.100 
that's really nice

00:02:08.100 --> 00:02:11.090 
that's really nice
the<00:02:08.640> there's<00:02:09.479> a<00:02:09.540> micro<00:02:09.960> just<00:02:10.290> on<00:02:10.590> the<00:02:10.950> end

00:02:11.090 --> 00:02:11.100 
the there's a micro just on the end

00:02:11.100 --> 00:02:13.210 
the there's a micro just on the end
there

00:02:13.210 --> 00:02:13.220 
there

00:02:13.220 --> 00:02:19.160 
there
they're<00:02:14.220> minor<00:02:15.120> gage<00:02:15.510> has<00:02:16.260> a<00:02:16.820> machined<00:02:18.170> tooth

00:02:19.160 --> 00:02:19.170 
they're minor gage has a machined tooth

00:02:19.170 --> 00:02:23.210 
they're minor gage has a machined tooth
system<00:02:19.800> here<00:02:20.100> and<00:02:20.790> here<00:02:21.210> that<00:02:21.570> allows<00:02:21.930> this<00:02:22.890> to

00:02:23.210 --> 00:02:23.220 
system here and here that allows this to

00:02:23.220 --> 00:02:26.300 
system here and here that allows this to
lock<00:02:23.760> down<00:02:24.230> let<00:02:25.230> me<00:02:25.320> slide<00:02:25.590> this<00:02:25.770> thing<00:02:26.010> back

00:02:26.300 --> 00:02:26.310 
lock down let me slide this thing back

00:02:26.310 --> 00:02:33.590 
lock down let me slide this thing back
and<00:02:29.360> allows<00:02:30.360> it<00:02:30.390> to<00:02:31.190> lock<00:02:32.190> down<00:02:32.580> so<00:02:33.270> if<00:02:33.330> we<00:02:33.420> want

00:02:33.590 --> 00:02:33.600 
and allows it to lock down so if we want

00:02:33.600 --> 00:02:38.180 
and allows it to lock down so if we want
to<00:02:33.660> slide<00:02:33.930> it<00:02:34.110> across<00:02:35.600> these<00:02:36.600> teeth<00:02:37.020> when<00:02:38.010> it

00:02:38.180 --> 00:02:38.190 
to slide it across these teeth when it

00:02:38.190 --> 00:02:40.910 
to slide it across these teeth when it
when<00:02:38.850> you<00:02:39.209> turn<00:02:39.930> these<00:02:40.080> thumb<00:02:40.380> wheels<00:02:40.650> in

00:02:40.910 --> 00:02:40.920 
when you turn these thumb wheels in

00:02:40.920 --> 00:02:43.220 
when you turn these thumb wheels in
there's<00:02:41.490> no<00:02:41.760> chance<00:02:42.120> of<00:02:42.330> this<00:02:42.510> thing<00:02:42.720> sliding

00:02:43.220 --> 00:02:43.230 
there's no chance of this thing sliding

00:02:43.230 --> 00:02:46.540 
there's no chance of this thing sliding
because<00:02:43.440> there's<00:02:43.709> teeth<00:02:44.640> on<00:02:44.970> the<00:02:45.570> flip<00:02:46.230> stop

00:02:46.540 --> 00:02:46.550 
because there's teeth on the flip stop

00:02:46.550 --> 00:02:50.150 
because there's teeth on the flip stop
messing<00:02:47.550> with<00:02:47.580> the<00:02:48.180> teeth<00:02:48.750> on<00:02:48.990> here<00:02:49.290> so<00:02:49.950> that

00:02:50.150 --> 00:02:50.160 
messing with the teeth on here so that

00:02:50.160 --> 00:02:53.120 
messing with the teeth on here so that
that<00:02:50.880> works<00:02:51.180> super<00:02:51.570> nice<00:02:51.780> this<00:02:52.620> thing<00:02:52.890> can<00:02:53.100> be

00:02:53.120 --> 00:02:53.130 
that works super nice this thing can be

00:02:53.130 --> 00:02:55.880 
that works super nice this thing can be
moved<00:02:53.610> forward<00:02:54.200> basically<00:02:55.200> three<00:02:55.500> quarters

00:02:55.880 --> 00:02:55.890 
moved forward basically three quarters

00:02:55.890 --> 00:02:58.760 
moved forward basically three quarters
of<00:02:56.040> an<00:02:56.160> inch<00:02:56.310> we<00:02:57.030> have<00:02:57.060> T<00:02:57.810> slots<00:02:58.140> on<00:02:58.410> the<00:02:58.530> front

00:02:58.760 --> 00:02:58.770 
of an inch we have T slots on the front

00:02:58.770 --> 00:03:00.320 
of an inch we have T slots on the front
of<00:02:58.860> this<00:02:59.010> thing<00:02:59.310> that<00:02:59.550> allows<00:02:59.610> you<00:03:00.030> to<00:03:00.090> put

00:03:00.320 --> 00:03:00.330

any custom fixture and this thing moves

00:03:09.300 --> 00:03:13.670 
any custom fixture and this thing moves
forward<00:03:09.959> to<00:03:11.000> accommodate<00:03:12.000> that<00:03:12.269> that<00:03:13.140> 3/4

forward to accommodate that that 3/4

00:03:13.680 --> 00:03:17.300 
forward to accommodate that that 3/4
inch<00:03:13.890> comes<00:03:14.580> with<00:03:14.850> a<00:03:15.060> nice<00:03:15.810> hold<00:03:16.140> down<00:03:16.380> the

00:03:17.300 --> 00:03:17.310 
inch comes with a nice hold down the

00:03:17.310 --> 00:03:21.800 
inch comes with a nice hold down the
sled<00:03:18.560> is<00:03:19.560> in<00:03:19.890> two<00:03:20.310> parts<00:03:20.760> and<00:03:20.970> this<00:03:21.180> is<00:03:21.360> cut<00:03:21.630> to

00:03:21.800 --> 00:03:21.810 
sled is in two parts and this is cut to

00:03:21.810 --> 00:03:25.370 
sled is in two parts and this is cut to
size<00:03:21.890> to<00:03:22.890> your<00:03:23.100> table<00:03:23.580> saw<00:03:23.760> when<00:03:24.660> not<00:03:24.959> when<00:03:25.260> you

00:03:25.370 --> 00:03:25.380 
size to your table saw when not when you

00:03:25.380 --> 00:03:27.080 
size to your table saw when not when you
get<00:03:25.560> it<00:03:25.709> you<00:03:25.830> assemble<00:03:26.250> the<00:03:26.459> thing<00:03:26.700> and<00:03:26.940> then

00:03:27.080 --> 00:03:27.090 
get it you assemble the thing and then

00:03:27.090 --> 00:03:31.880 
get it you assemble the thing and then
you<00:03:27.330> you<00:03:28.140> rip<00:03:28.350> it<00:03:28.500> down<00:03:29.540> but<00:03:30.560> you'll<00:03:31.560> notice

00:03:31.880 --> 00:03:31.890 
you you rip it down but you'll notice

00:03:31.890 --> 00:03:35.390 
you you rip it down but you'll notice
this<00:03:32.040> side<00:03:32.310> over<00:03:33.239> here<00:03:33.269> is<00:03:34.130> separate<00:03:35.130> so<00:03:35.160> if

00:03:35.390 --> 00:03:35.400 
this side over here is separate so if

00:03:35.400 --> 00:03:37.160 
this side over here is separate so if
you're<00:03:35.549> cutting<00:03:35.790> through<00:03:36.060> and<00:03:36.570> you've<00:03:37.019> got<00:03:37.140> a

00:03:37.160 --> 00:03:37.170 
you're cutting through and you've got a

00:03:37.170 --> 00:03:38.720 
you're cutting through and you've got a
board<00:03:37.440> hanging<00:03:37.799> out<00:03:37.920> here<00:03:38.130> instead<00:03:38.459> of<00:03:38.580> that

00:03:38.720 --> 00:03:38.730 
board hanging out here instead of that

00:03:38.730 --> 00:03:40.699 
board hanging out here instead of that
board<00:03:39.060> drop<00:03:39.570> it<00:03:39.780> down<00:03:39.930> and<00:03:40.200> catching<00:03:40.590> the

00:03:40.699 --> 00:03:40.709 
board drop it down and catching the

00:03:40.709 --> 00:03:44.770 
board drop it down and catching the
blade<00:03:41.480> it<00:03:42.480> keeps<00:03:42.750> it<00:03:42.989> cubes<00:03:43.650> of<00:03:43.799> level<00:03:44.160> so

00:03:44.770 --> 00:03:44.780 
blade it keeps it cubes of level so

00:03:44.780 --> 00:03:48.410 
blade it keeps it cubes of level so
that's<00:03:45.780> a<00:03:46.080> that's<00:03:46.470> a<00:03:46.739> pretty<00:03:47.400> nice<00:03:47.670> feature<00:03:48.000> on

00:03:48.410 --> 00:03:48.420 
that's a that's a pretty nice feature on

00:03:48.420 --> 00:03:52.150 
that's a that's a pretty nice feature on
that<00:03:49.170> thing<00:03:49.410> as<00:03:49.560> well<00:03:49.769> there's<00:03:50.549> a<00:03:50.820> little<00:03:51.510> else

00:03:52.150 --> 00:03:52.160 
that thing as well there's a little else

00:03:52.160 --> 00:03:56.590 
that thing as well there's a little else
crack<00:03:52.850> it<00:03:53.060> back<00:03:53.390> here<00:03:53.690> and<00:03:54.340> you<00:03:55.340> when<00:03:56.330> you<00:03:56.420> put

00:03:56.590 --> 00:03:56.600 
crack it back here and you when you put

00:03:56.600 --> 00:04:00.790 
crack it back here and you when you put
that<00:03:56.750> on<00:03:56.990> you<00:03:57.680> can<00:03:57.710> block<00:03:58.160> the<00:03:58.730> miter<00:03:59.420> gauge<00:03:59.800> to

00:04:00.790 --> 00:04:00.800 
that on you can block the miter gauge to

00:04:00.800 --> 00:04:04.320 
that on you can block the miter gauge to
your<00:04:01.100> sled<00:04:02.030> I've<00:04:02.990> had<00:04:03.230> this<00:04:03.440> for

00:04:04.320 --> 00:04:04.330 
your sled I've had this for

00:04:04.330 --> 00:04:06.640 
your sled I've had this for
approximately<00:04:05.330> a<00:04:05.630> year<00:04:05.990> and<00:04:06.140> a<00:04:06.200> half<00:04:06.350> now<00:04:06.380> and

00:04:06.640 --> 00:04:06.650 
approximately a year and a half now and

00:04:06.650 --> 00:04:08.890 
approximately a year and a half now and
I've<00:04:07.340> used<00:04:07.580> it<00:04:07.790> quite<00:04:07.910> a<00:04:08.030> bit<00:04:08.120> so<00:04:08.570> it's<00:04:08.720> not<00:04:08.840> a

00:04:08.890 --> 00:04:08.900 
I've used it quite a bit so it's not a

00:04:08.900 --> 00:04:11.290 
I've used it quite a bit so it's not a
tool<00:04:09.170> that<00:04:09.560> I<00:04:09.890> just<00:04:10.430> brought<00:04:10.730> into<00:04:11.000> the<00:04:11.090> shop

00:04:11.290 --> 00:04:11.300 
tool that I just brought into the shop

00:04:11.300 --> 00:04:13.690 
tool that I just brought into the shop
for<00:04:11.330> the<00:04:11.600> first<00:04:11.840> time<00:04:12.080> doing<00:04:13.010> a<00:04:13.100> review<00:04:13.430> on<00:04:13.670> it

00:04:13.690 --> 00:04:13.700 
for the first time doing a review on it

00:04:13.700 --> 00:04:16.680 
for the first time doing a review on it
I've<00:04:14.300> got<00:04:14.540> a<00:04:14.570> lot<00:04:14.630> of<00:04:14.780> use<00:04:15.020> out<00:04:15.200> of<00:04:15.260> it<00:04:15.590> and<00:04:15.830> I

00:04:16.680 --> 00:04:16.690 
I've got a lot of use out of it and I

00:04:16.690 --> 00:04:20.470 
I've got a lot of use out of it and I
could<00:04:17.690> not<00:04:17.810> be<00:04:18.110> happier<00:04:18.890> it's<00:04:19.160> been<00:04:19.450> been<00:04:20.450> a

00:04:20.470 --> 00:04:20.480 
could not be happier it's been been a

00:04:20.480 --> 00:04:22.930 
could not be happier it's been been a
great<00:04:20.780> miter<00:04:21.709> gauge<00:04:21.980> I<00:04:22.280> just<00:04:22.490> wasn't<00:04:22.730> sure

00:04:22.930 --> 00:04:22.940 
great miter gauge I just wasn't sure

00:04:22.940 --> 00:04:25.630 
great miter gauge I just wasn't sure
what<00:04:23.570> I<00:04:23.630> was<00:04:23.810> going<00:04:24.020> to<00:04:24.080> do<00:04:24.260> maite<00:04:25.010> gauge<00:04:25.280> that

what I was going to do maite gauge that
come<00:04:26.270> with<00:04:26.450> this<00:04:26.630> thing<00:04:26.900> was<00:04:27.200> just<00:04:27.410> awful<00:04:28.130> and

00:04:28.750 --> 00:04:28.760 
come with this thing was just awful and
