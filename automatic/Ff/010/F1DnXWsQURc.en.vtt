that's<00:00:57.570> absolutely<00:00:58.050> correct<00:00:58.260> -<00:00:58.650> and<00:00:58.920> the<00:00:59.040> HD

00:00:59.330 --> 00:00:59.340 
that's absolutely correct - and the HD

00:00:59.340 --> 00:01:01.220 
that's absolutely correct - and the HD
radio<00:00:59.580> network<00:01:00.060> the<00:01:00.330> pipeline<00:01:00.720> itself<00:01:00.990> is

00:01:01.220 --> 00:01:01.230 
radio network the pipeline itself is

00:01:01.230 --> 00:01:03.260 
radio network the pipeline itself is
very<00:01:01.680> very<00:01:01.980> vast<00:01:02.310> and<00:01:02.670> it<00:01:02.760> has<00:01:02.940> a<00:01:02.970> lot<00:01:03.240> of

00:01:03.260 --> 00:01:03.270 
very very vast and it has a lot of

00:01:03.270 --> 00:01:05.240 
very very vast and it has a lot of
bandwidth<00:01:03.750> so<00:01:04.080> that<00:01:04.439> information<00:01:04.589> not<00:01:05.189> only

00:01:05.240 --> 00:01:05.250 
bandwidth so that information not only

00:01:05.250 --> 00:01:07.580 
bandwidth so that information not only
you're<00:01:05.580> getting<00:01:05.670> similar<00:01:06.420> content<00:01:07.080> but<00:01:07.470> it's

00:01:07.580 --> 00:01:07.590 
you're getting similar content but it's

00:01:07.590 --> 00:01:09.080 
you're getting similar content but it's
coming<00:01:07.860> through<00:01:07.890> a<00:01:08.040> lot<00:01:08.220> faster<00:01:08.850> down<00:01:09.060> the

00:01:09.080 --> 00:01:09.090 
coming through a lot faster down the

00:01:09.090 --> 00:01:11.929 
coming through a lot faster down the
pipeline<00:01:09.390> -<00:01:09.899> because<00:01:10.289> the<00:01:10.409> HD<00:01:10.560> network<00:01:11.159> has<00:01:11.909> a

00:01:11.929 --> 00:01:11.939 
pipeline - because the HD network has a

00:01:11.939 --> 00:01:13.730 
pipeline - because the HD network has a
little<00:01:12.210> more<00:01:12.329> capability<00:01:13.020> for<00:01:13.200> these<00:01:13.350> type<00:01:13.590> of

00:01:13.730 --> 00:01:13.740 
little more capability for these type of

00:01:13.740 --> 00:01:15.800 
little more capability for these type of
data<00:01:13.920> services<00:01:14.549> that<00:01:15.179> we<00:01:15.270> just<00:01:15.450> talked<00:01:15.689> about

00:01:15.800 --> 00:01:15.810 
data services that we just talked about

00:01:15.810 --> 00:01:18.109 
data services that we just talked about
so<00:01:15.979> now<00:01:16.979> what<00:01:17.159> other<00:01:17.310> types<00:01:17.520> of<00:01:17.700> navigation

00:01:18.109 --> 00:01:18.119 
so now what other types of navigation

00:01:18.119 --> 00:01:20.660 
so now what other types of navigation
features<00:01:18.810> does<00:01:19.020> this<00:01:19.200> have<00:01:19.409> I<00:01:19.439> know<00:01:19.740> JVC<00:01:20.490> has

00:01:20.660 --> 00:01:20.670 
features does this have I know JVC has

00:01:20.670 --> 00:01:23.630 
features does this have I know JVC has
had<00:01:20.789> a<00:01:20.819> lot<00:01:21.829> about<00:01:22.829> their<00:01:23.009> navigation<00:01:23.429> to<00:01:23.490> pass

00:01:23.630 --> 00:01:23.640 
had a lot about their navigation to pass

00:01:23.640 --> 00:01:25.069 
had a lot about their navigation to pass
as<00:01:23.789> far<00:01:23.939> as<00:01:24.030> like<00:01:24.149> Lane<00:01:24.420> Guidance<00:01:24.630> and<00:01:24.990> other

00:01:25.069 --> 00:01:25.079 
as far as like Lane Guidance and other

00:01:25.079 --> 00:01:26.300 
as far as like Lane Guidance and other
things<00:01:25.289> like<00:01:25.380> that<00:01:25.439> right<00:01:25.920> what<00:01:26.100> does<00:01:26.219> this

00:01:26.300 --> 00:01:26.310 
things like that right what does this

00:01:26.310 --> 00:01:28.880 
things like that right what does this
have<00:01:26.520> this<00:01:27.390> does<00:01:27.569> have<00:01:27.689> a<00:01:27.749> leg<00:01:27.929> is<00:01:28.109> on<00:01:28.380> there<00:01:28.679> so

00:01:28.880 --> 00:01:28.890 
have this does have a leg is on there so

00:01:28.890 --> 00:01:29.959 
have this does have a leg is on there so
it<00:01:28.979> will<00:01:29.069> tell<00:01:29.249> you<00:01:29.340> which<00:01:29.460> lane<00:01:29.640> you<00:01:29.670> need<00:01:29.909> to

00:01:29.959 --> 00:01:29.969 
it will tell you which lane you need to

00:01:29.969 --> 00:01:31.459 
it will tell you which lane you need to
be<00:01:30.090> in<00:01:30.210> when<00:01:30.390> you're<00:01:30.479> exiting<00:01:30.749> or<00:01:31.079> entering<00:01:31.350> a

00:01:31.459 --> 00:01:31.469 
be in when you're exiting or entering a

00:01:31.469 --> 00:01:33.800 
be in when you're exiting or entering a
freeway<00:01:31.799> and<00:01:31.979> things<00:01:32.130> like<00:01:32.280> that<00:01:32.520> also<00:01:33.359> it<00:01:33.630> has

00:01:33.800 --> 00:01:33.810 
freeway and things like that also it has

00:01:33.810 --> 00:01:35.840 
freeway and things like that also it has
a<00:01:33.840> speed<00:01:34.289> limit<00:01:34.319> display<00:01:34.770> on<00:01:34.979> there<00:01:35.189> so<00:01:35.639> it

00:01:35.840 --> 00:01:35.850 
a speed limit display on there so it

00:01:35.850 --> 00:01:37.849 
a speed limit display on there so it
will<00:01:35.939> tell<00:01:36.119> you<00:01:36.299> on<00:01:36.539> most<00:01:36.869> major<00:01:36.990> freeways<00:01:37.530> and
