refined planks do not keep them in raw
material<00:01:05.820> form<00:01:06.090> because<00:01:06.270> that's<00:01:06.450> the<00:01:06.630> key<00:01:06.869> to

00:01:07.100 --> 00:01:07.110 
material form because that's the key to

00:01:07.110 --> 00:01:10.280 
material form because that's the key to
making<00:01:07.320> gold<00:01:07.710> with<00:01:08.130> your<00:01:08.340> professions<00:01:09.290> now

making gold with your professions now

00:01:10.290 --> 00:01:12.710 
making gold with your professions now
the<00:01:10.350> reason<00:01:10.770> why<00:01:11.070> we<00:01:11.280> keep<00:01:11.549> our<00:01:11.850> materials<00:01:12.510> in

00:01:12.710 --> 00:01:12.720 
the reason why we keep our materials in

00:01:12.720 --> 00:01:16.039 
the reason why we keep our materials in
raw<00:01:13.140> form<00:01:13.650> is<00:01:13.890> because<00:01:14.640> the<00:01:14.939> buyer<00:01:15.210> is<00:01:15.240> more

00:01:16.039 --> 00:01:16.049 
raw form is because the buyer is more

00:01:16.049 --> 00:01:19.010 
raw form is because the buyer is more
likely<00:01:16.409> to<00:01:16.979> take<00:01:17.189> raw<00:01:17.490> materials<00:01:18.180> because

00:01:19.010 --> 00:01:19.020 
likely to take raw materials because

00:01:19.020 --> 00:01:22.520 
likely to take raw materials because
when<00:01:19.290> they<00:01:19.500> craft<00:01:19.920> that<00:01:20.880> iron<00:01:21.299> ore<00:01:21.540> into<00:01:22.290> iron

00:01:22.520 --> 00:01:22.530 
when they craft that iron ore into iron

00:01:22.530 --> 00:01:25.310 
when they craft that iron ore into iron
ingots<00:01:23.009> and<00:01:23.220> so<00:01:23.610> on<00:01:23.820> it'll<00:01:24.780> actually<00:01:24.960> give

00:01:25.310 --> 00:01:25.320 
ingots and so on it'll actually give

00:01:25.320 --> 00:01:27.890 
ingots and so on it'll actually give
them<00:01:25.380> rare<00:01:25.770> items<00:01:26.189> like<00:01:26.369> honing<00:01:26.820> stones<00:01:27.150> that
