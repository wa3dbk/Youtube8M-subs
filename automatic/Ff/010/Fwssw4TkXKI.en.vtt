like that but just as a little tip now
after<00:01:57.960> I<00:01:58.020> have<00:01:58.200> the<00:01:58.409> one<00:01:58.590> bind<00:01:58.860> down<00:01:59.040> I've

00:01:59.209 --> 00:01:59.219 
after I have the one bind down I've

00:01:59.219 --> 00:02:00.590 
after I have the one bind down I've
already<00:01:59.460> started<00:01:59.790> here<00:01:59.969> but<00:02:00.090> I<00:02:00.149> always<00:02:00.390> come

00:02:00.590 --> 00:02:00.600 
already started here but I always come

00:02:00.600 --> 00:02:02.090 
already started here but I always come
through<00:02:00.630> and<00:02:00.930> I<00:02:00.990> make<00:02:01.140> a<00:02:01.170> like<00:02:01.350> a<00:02:01.380> second<00:02:01.860> vine

00:02:02.090 --> 00:02:02.100 
through and I make a like a second vine

00:02:02.100 --> 00:02:04.200 
through and I make a like a second vine
and<00:02:02.540> again<00:02:03.540> I'm<00:02:03.659> gonna<00:02:03.750> sit

00:02:04.200 --> 00:02:04.210 
and again I'm gonna sit

00:02:04.210 --> 00:02:08.370 
and again I'm gonna sit
down<00:02:04.390> lift<00:02:05.020> up<00:02:06.720> sit<00:02:07.720> down

00:02:08.370 --> 00:02:08.380 
down lift up sit down

00:02:08.380 --> 00:02:14.430 
down lift up sit down
lift<00:02:08.590> up<00:02:10.770> pressure<00:02:11.770> release<00:02:13.200> I'm<00:02:14.200> gonna

00:02:14.430 --> 00:02:14.440 
lift up pressure release I'm gonna

00:02:14.440 --> 00:02:15.900 
lift up pressure release I'm gonna
actually<00:02:14.650> pee<00:02:14.980> smell<00:02:15.250> because<00:02:15.459> it's<00:02:15.610> a<00:02:15.700> little

00:02:15.900 --> 00:02:15.910 
actually pee smell because it's a little

00:02:15.910 --> 00:02:17.400 
actually pee smell because it's a little
bit<00:02:16.060> easier<00:02:16.420> to<00:02:16.480> do<00:02:16.690> it<00:02:16.810> this<00:02:16.930> way<00:02:17.140> I'm<00:02:17.290> gonna

00:02:17.400 --> 00:02:17.410 
bit easier to do it this way I'm gonna

00:02:17.410 --> 00:02:20.309 
bit easier to do it this way I'm gonna
go<00:02:17.560> around<00:02:17.709> maybe<00:02:18.100> this<00:02:18.310> way<00:02:19.050> does<00:02:20.050> not<00:02:20.170> really

00:02:20.309 --> 00:02:20.319 
go around maybe this way does not really

00:02:20.319 --> 00:02:23.670 
go around maybe this way does not really
matter<00:02:20.530> which<00:02:20.770> way<00:02:20.950> you<00:02:21.010> pull<00:02:22.110> sit<00:02:23.110> down<00:02:23.350> look

00:02:23.670 --> 00:02:23.680 
matter which way you pull sit down look

00:02:23.680 --> 00:02:26.309 
matter which way you pull sit down look
up<00:02:23.980> if<00:02:24.700> it<00:02:24.880> makes<00:02:25.060> this<00:02:25.209> little<00:02:25.420> look<00:02:25.720> I<00:02:25.989> call<00:02:26.290> a

00:02:26.309 --> 00:02:26.319 
up if it makes this little look I call a

00:02:26.319 --> 00:02:28.110 
up if it makes this little look I call a
little<00:02:26.530> doohickey<00:02:27.010> there<00:02:27.220> that's<00:02:27.850> fine

00:02:28.110 --> 00:02:28.120 
little doohickey there that's fine

00:02:28.120 --> 00:02:30.770 
little doohickey there that's fine
that's<00:02:28.390> totally<00:02:28.810> fine<00:02:28.989> don't<00:02:29.290> worry<00:02:29.470> about<00:02:29.590> it

00:02:30.770 --> 00:02:30.780 
that's totally fine don't worry about it

00:02:30.780 --> 00:02:33.120 
that's totally fine don't worry about it

00:02:33.120 --> 00:02:33.130 
we'll come back in and play with that

00:02:33.130 --> 00:02:35.640 
we'll come back in and play with that
again<00:02:33.430> later<00:02:33.670> this<00:02:34.200> needs<00:02:35.200> to<00:02:35.260> be<00:02:35.350> just<00:02:35.560> a

00:02:35.640 --> 00:02:35.650
