00:01:46.770 --> 00:01:49.580 
the items are going down some are going
up<00:01:46.920> so<00:01:47.100> I<00:01:47.130> think<00:01:47.250> it's<00:01:47.549> about<00:01:47.670> 15<00:01:48.180> mil<00:01:48.420> I<00:01:48.630> don't

00:01:49.580 --> 00:01:49.590 
up so I think it's about 15 mil I don't

00:01:49.590 --> 00:01:51.440 
up so I think it's about 15 mil I don't
know<00:01:49.710> exactly<00:01:50.280> what<00:01:50.490> i<00:01:50.520> had<00:01:50.759> last<00:01:50.939> episode<00:01:51.420> i

00:01:51.440 --> 00:01:51.450 
know exactly what i had last episode i

00:01:51.450 --> 00:01:53.240 
know exactly what i had last episode i
think<00:01:51.570> it<00:01:51.780> was<00:01:51.840> like<00:01:51.990> 11<00:01:52.079> mil<00:01:52.530> so<00:01:52.979> i<00:01:53.009> did

00:01:53.240 --> 00:01:53.250 
think it was like 11 mil so i did

00:01:53.250 --> 00:01:55.069 
think it was like 11 mil so i did
increase<00:01:53.579> a<00:01:53.640> lot<00:01:53.939> in<00:01:54.119> just<00:01:54.450> rare<00:01:54.630> drop<00:01:54.869> so

00:01:55.069 --> 00:01:55.079 
increase a lot in just rare drop so

00:01:55.079 --> 00:01:57.139 
increase a lot in just rare drop so
that's<00:01:55.229> pretty<00:01:55.409> cool<00:01:55.590> so<00:01:56.520> now<00:01:56.640> let's<00:01:56.850> just<00:01:57.000> put

00:01:57.139 --> 00:01:57.149
