00:02:14.210 --> 00:02:14.220 
so I set this over to come to our box is

00:02:14.220 --> 00:02:27.890 
so I set this over to come to our box is
our<00:02:14.720> silicone<00:02:15.720> couplers<00:02:16.200> we<00:02:16.350> have<00:02:16.530> here<00:02:26.900> of

00:02:32.030 --> 00:02:32.040 
come to is our actual filter I want to

00:02:32.040 --> 00:02:34.550 
come to is our actual filter I want to
point<00:02:32.190> out<00:02:32.490> on<00:02:32.730> this<00:02:32.880> filter<00:02:33.240> box<00:02:33.510> the<00:02:34.110> actual

00:02:34.550 --> 00:02:34.560 
point out on this filter box the actual

00:02:34.560 --> 00:02:36.140 
point out on this filter box the actual

00:02:36.140 --> 00:02:36.150 
part number for the filter is going to

00:02:36.150 --> 00:02:39.170 
part number for the filter is going to
be<00:02:36.209> right<00:02:36.360> here<00:02:36.540> on<00:02:36.600> the<00:02:36.690> corner<00:02:37.970> so<00:02:38.970> you<00:02:39.030> can

00:02:39.170 --> 00:02:39.180 
be right here on the corner so you can

00:02:39.180 --> 00:02:41.870 
be right here on the corner so you can
see<00:02:39.510> it's<00:02:39.930> very<00:02:39.989> crucial<00:02:40.380> if<00:02:41.040> you<00:02:41.100> buy<00:02:41.400> a<00:02:41.459> cold

00:02:41.870 --> 00:02:41.880 
see it's very crucial if you buy a cold

00:02:41.880 --> 00:02:43.400 
see it's very crucial if you buy a cold
air<00:02:42.030> intake<00:02:42.510> to<00:02:42.690> make<00:02:42.840> sure<00:02:42.959> and<00:02:43.080> write<00:02:43.200> this

00:02:43.400 --> 00:02:43.410 
air intake to make sure and write this

00:02:43.410 --> 00:02:44.479 
air intake to make sure and write this
down

00:02:44.479 --> 00:02:44.489 
down

00:02:44.489 --> 00:02:46.460 
down
chances<00:02:45.120> are<00:02:45.239> you<00:02:45.450> you<00:02:45.750> won't<00:02:45.989> need<00:02:46.140> to<00:02:46.200> buy<00:02:46.440> a

00:02:46.460 --> 00:02:46.470 
chances are you you won't need to buy a

00:02:46.470 --> 00:02:47.990 
chances are you you won't need to buy a
replacement<00:02:46.709> filter<00:02:47.310> but<00:02:47.430> if<00:02:47.520> you<00:02:47.670> ever<00:02:47.760> do

00:02:47.990 --> 00:02:48.000 
replacement filter but if you ever do

00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:49.940 
replacement filter but if you ever do
this<00:02:48.030> will<00:02:48.450> make<00:02:48.600> it<00:02:48.780> so<00:02:48.810> much<00:02:49.200> easier<00:02:49.260> for<00:02:49.830> you

00:02:49.940 --> 00:02:49.950 
this will make it so much easier for you

00:05:30.949 --> 00:05:30.959 
easier to see what you're doing we

00:05:30.959 --> 00:05:32.449 
easier to see what you're doing we
thought<00:05:31.139> this<00:05:31.289> was<00:05:31.499> one<00:05:31.709> really<00:05:31.949> neat<00:05:32.189> thing

00:05:32.449 --> 00:05:32.459 
thought this was one really neat thing

00:05:32.459 --> 00:05:35.809 
thought this was one really neat thing
that<00:05:32.489> an<00:05:32.939> SMB<00:05:33.329> comes<00:05:33.749> with<00:05:34.019> is<00:05:34.709> not<00:05:35.459> only<00:05:35.669> did

00:05:35.809 --> 00:05:35.819 
that an SMB comes with is not only did

00:05:35.819 --> 00:05:38.089 
that an SMB comes with is not only did
they<00:05:35.939> send<00:05:36.179> you<00:05:36.209> an<00:05:36.359> SMB<00:05:36.719> decal<00:05:37.319> in<00:05:37.559> every<00:05:37.889> box

00:05:38.089 --> 00:05:38.099 
they send you an SMB decal in every box

00:05:38.099 --> 00:05:43.099 
they send you an SMB decal in every box
but<00:05:38.909> they<00:05:39.029> also<00:05:39.859> send<00:05:40.859> you<00:05:41.209> your<00:05:42.209> car<00:05:42.569> approved

stickers so those of you that are in car
areas<00:05:45.689> or<00:05:46.139> small<00:05:46.949> areas<00:05:47.249> where<00:05:47.609> they<00:05:47.699> make<00:05:47.819> you

00:05:47.899 --> 00:05:47.909 
areas or small areas where they make you

00:05:47.909 --> 00:05:49.489 
areas or small areas where they make you
do<00:05:47.969> the<00:05:48.059> testing<00:05:48.419> this<00:05:48.599> is<00:05:48.839> a<00:05:48.869> very<00:05:49.319> nice

00:05:49.489 --> 00:05:49.499 
do the testing this is a very nice

00:05:49.499 --> 00:05:52.009 
do the testing this is a very nice
feature<00:05:49.709> that<00:05:49.949> they<00:05:50.099> send<00:05:50.369> you<00:05:50.459> and<00:05:51.329> last<00:05:51.749> but

00:05:52.009 --> 00:05:52.019 
feature that they send you and last but

00:05:52.019 --> 00:05:53.239 
feature that they send you and last but
not<00:05:52.169> least<00:05:52.469> probably<00:05:52.889> one<00:05:52.979> of<00:05:53.009> the<00:05:53.099> most

00:05:53.239 --> 00:05:53.249 
not least probably one of the most

00:05:53.249 --> 00:05:55.009 
not least probably one of the most
important<00:05:53.729> things<00:05:53.909> that<00:05:54.149> they<00:05:54.419> send<00:05:54.659> with<00:05:54.839> it

important things that they send with it

00:05:55.019 --> 00:05:58.189 
important things that they send with it
this<00:05:55.860> is<00:05:56.309> the<00:05:56.699> clear<00:05:57.299> plexiglass<00:05:57.539> lid

00:05:58.189 --> 00:05:58.199 
this is the clear plexiglass lid

00:05:58.199 --> 00:05:59.959 
this is the clear plexiglass lid
obviously<00:05:58.769> the<00:05:58.889> cardboard<00:05:59.369> still<00:05:59.699> on<00:05:59.849> it

00:05:59.959 --> 00:05:59.969 
obviously the cardboard still on it

00:05:59.969 --> 00:06:01.100 
obviously the cardboard still on it
right<00:06:00.119> now<00:06:00.299> you<00:06:00.360> can<00:06:00.629> see<00:06:00.779> that<00:06:00.959> they've

00:06:01.100 --> 00:06:01.110 
right now you can see that they've

00:06:01.110 --> 00:06:04.189 
right now you can see that they've
already<00:06:01.289> cut<00:06:01.619> the<00:06:01.739> SMB<00:06:02.189> out<00:06:02.429> and<00:06:03.299> it<00:06:03.749> is<00:06:03.959> very

00:06:04.189 --> 00:06:04.199 
already cut the SMB out and it is very

00:06:04.199 --> 00:06:08.689 
already cut the SMB out and it is very
simply<00:06:04.559> fits<00:06:04.799> right<00:06:05.009> on<00:06:05.159> top<00:06:05.369> of<00:06:05.549> the<00:06:05.639> kit<00:06:07.699> just

00:06:08.689 --> 00:06:08.699 
simply fits right on top of the kit just

00:06:08.699 --> 00:06:11.509 
simply fits right on top of the kit just
like<00:06:08.909> that<00:06:09.119> right<00:06:09.329> there<00:06:09.709> so<00:06:10.709> this<00:06:11.039> has<00:06:11.309> been

00:06:11.509 --> 00:06:11.519 
like that right there so this has been

00:06:11.519 --> 00:06:17.389 
like that right there so this has been
an<00:06:11.669> unboxing<00:06:11.999> video<00:06:12.419> for<00:06:12.509> the<00:06:12.809> SMB<00:06:14.659> 7<00:06:15.659> 5<00:06:15.929> -<00:06:16.769> 5<00:06:17.369> 0

00:06:17.389 --> 00:06:17.399 
an unboxing video for the SMB 7 5 - 5 0

00:06:17.399 --> 00:06:20.209 
an unboxing video for the SMB 7 5 - 5 0
3<00:06:18.239> -<00:06:18.509> I'll<00:06:18.959> just<00:06:19.139> double<00:06:19.469> check<00:06:19.619> myself<00:06:19.829> on<00:06:20.129> the

00:06:20.209 --> 00:06:20.219 
3 - I'll just double check myself on the
