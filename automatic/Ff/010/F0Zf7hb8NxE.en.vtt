00:07:03.880 --> 00:07:03.890 
and that's the way you lose engines but

00:07:03.890 --> 00:07:05.980 
and that's the way you lose engines but
the<00:07:03.980> remedy<00:07:04.340> is<00:07:04.400> simple<00:07:04.730> you<00:07:05.570> order<00:07:05.900> the

the remedy is simple you order the

00:07:05.990 --> 00:07:07.750 
the remedy is simple you order the
regulator<00:07:06.410> to<00:07:06.590> open<00:07:06.860> the<00:07:06.950> wastegate<00:07:07.250> a<00:07:07.400> little
