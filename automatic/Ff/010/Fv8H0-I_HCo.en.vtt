the<00:00:59.930> bench<00:01:00.930> is<00:01:01.140> a<00:01:01.260> little<00:01:01.620> bit<00:01:01.739> flatter<00:01:02.039> than

00:01:02.299 --> 00:01:02.309 
the bench is a little bit flatter than

00:01:02.309 --> 00:01:04.490 
the bench is a little bit flatter than
it<00:01:02.460> used<00:01:02.640> to<00:01:02.760> be<00:01:02.960> there's<00:01:03.960> a<00:01:04.080> little<00:01:04.290> more

00:01:04.490 --> 00:01:04.500 
it used to be there's a little more

00:01:04.500 --> 00:01:07.340 
it used to be there's a little more
space<00:01:04.830> between<00:01:05.630> the<00:01:06.630> bench<00:01:06.810> and<00:01:07.049> the<00:01:07.140> front

00:01:07.340 --> 00:01:07.350 
space between the bench and the front

00:01:07.350 --> 00:01:08.750 
space between the bench and the front
seats<00:01:07.619> and<00:01:07.830> part<00:01:08.010> of<00:01:08.070> the<00:01:08.159> way<00:01:08.250> they<00:01:08.430> achieve

00:01:08.750 --> 00:01:08.760 
seats and part of the way they achieve

00:01:08.760 --> 00:01:11.330 
seats and part of the way they achieve
that<00:01:08.970> was<00:01:09.720> the<00:01:10.049> this<00:01:10.350> clever<00:01:10.650> styling<00:01:11.159> of<00:01:11.280> the

00:01:11.330 --> 00:01:11.340 
that was the this clever styling of the

00:01:11.340 --> 00:01:13.880 
that was the this clever styling of the
front<00:01:11.580> seat<00:01:11.820> so<00:01:12.060> you<00:01:12.090> still<00:01:12.420> get<00:01:12.570> the<00:01:12.890> driver

00:01:13.880 --> 00:01:13.890 
front seat so you still get the driver

00:01:13.890 --> 00:01:15.590 
front seat so you still get the driver
and<00:01:14.100> the<00:01:14.189> front<00:01:14.640> passenger<00:01:14.970> still<00:01:15.390> get<00:01:15.509> the

00:01:15.590 --> 00:01:15.600 
and the front passenger still get the

00:01:15.600 --> 00:01:17.780 
and the front passenger still get the
same<00:01:15.630> amount<00:01:15.810> of<00:01:16.049> comfort<00:01:16.229> while<00:01:17.100> the<00:01:17.490> rear

00:01:17.780 --> 00:01:17.790 
same amount of comfort while the rear

00:01:17.790 --> 00:01:19.580 
same amount of comfort while the rear
passengers<00:01:18.299> get<00:01:18.540> a<00:01:18.570> little<00:01:18.780> extra<00:01:19.049> legroom

00:01:19.580 --> 00:01:19.590 
passengers get a little extra legroom

00:01:19.590 --> 00:01:24.080 
passengers get a little extra legroom
and<00:01:20.150> they<00:01:21.150> still<00:01:21.540> let<00:01:21.780> the<00:01:21.990> doors<00:01:22.860> open<00:01:23.250> just

00:01:24.080 --> 00:01:24.090 
and they still let the doors open just

00:01:24.090 --> 00:01:26.090 
and they still let the doors open just
about<00:01:24.299> to<00:01:24.479> 90<00:01:24.780> degrees<00:01:24.869> which<00:01:25.740> is<00:01:25.890> something

00:01:26.090 --> 00:01:26.100 
about to 90 degrees which is something

00:01:26.100 --> 00:01:31.460 
about to 90 degrees which is something
I've<00:01:26.400> always<00:01:26.750> liked<00:01:27.750> and<00:01:28.610> one<00:01:29.610> very<00:01:30.299> cool<00:01:30.720> new

00:01:31.460 --> 00:01:31.470 
I've always liked and one very cool new

00:01:31.470 --> 00:01:34.490 
I've always liked and one very cool new
feature<00:01:31.799> that<00:01:32.159> they're<00:01:32.460> offering<00:01:32.820> that

00:01:34.490 --> 00:01:34.500 
feature that they're offering that

00:01:34.500 --> 00:01:38.750 
feature that they're offering that
is<00:01:34.590> an<00:01:35.490> auto-dimming<00:01:36.680> exterior<00:01:37.760> rearview

00:01:38.750 --> 00:01:38.760 
is an auto-dimming exterior rearview

00:01:38.760 --> 00:01:41.510 
is an auto-dimming exterior rearview
mirror<00:01:39.300> and<00:01:39.480> this<00:01:40.410> glowing<00:01:40.680> thing<00:01:41.040> here<00:01:41.370> is

00:01:41.510 --> 00:01:41.520 
mirror and this glowing thing here is

00:01:41.520 --> 00:01:43.280 
mirror and this glowing thing here is
referred<00:01:41.910> to<00:01:41.970> as<00:01:42.180> the<00:01:42.330> approach<00:01:42.750> light<00:01:43.050> that's

00:01:43.280 --> 00:01:43.290 
referred to as the approach light that's

00:01:43.290 --> 00:01:44.540 
referred to as the approach light that's
probably<00:01:43.530> tough<00:01:43.740> to<00:01:43.890> see<00:01:44.040> in<00:01:44.130> the<00:01:44.190> video<00:01:44.400> but

00:01:44.540 --> 00:01:44.550 
probably tough to see in the video but

00:01:44.550 --> 00:01:47.000 
probably tough to see in the video but
there's<00:01:44.729> actually<00:01:45.030> a<00:01:45.060> little<00:01:45.440> Subaru<00:01:46.440> logo<00:01:46.860> in

00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:47.010 
there's actually a little Subaru logo in

00:01:47.010 --> 00:01:49.550 
there's actually a little Subaru logo in
there<00:01:47.130> looks<00:01:47.610> very<00:01:48.150> cool<00:01:48.450> so<00:01:49.290> when<00:01:49.440> you're

00:01:49.550 --> 00:01:49.560 
there looks very cool so when you're

00:01:49.560 --> 00:01:51.109 
there looks very cool so when you're
driving<00:01:49.770> at<00:01:49.950> night<00:01:50.190> someone's<00:01:50.790> coming<00:01:50.910> up

00:01:51.109 --> 00:01:51.119 
driving at night someone's coming up

00:01:51.119 --> 00:01:53.630 
driving at night someone's coming up
behind<00:01:51.240> you<00:01:51.510> with<00:01:51.540> their<00:01:52.040> headlights<00:01:53.040> wearing

00:01:53.630 --> 00:01:53.640 
behind you with their headlights wearing

00:01:53.640 --> 00:01:55.670 
behind you with their headlights wearing
that<00:01:54.180> will<00:01:54.420> darken<00:01:54.690> just<00:01:55.020> like<00:01:55.170> the<00:01:55.380> auto

00:01:55.670 --> 00:01:55.680 
that will darken just like the auto

00:01:55.680 --> 00:02:01.130 
that will darken just like the auto
dimming<00:01:56.010> interior<00:01:56.610> mirrors<00:01:57.390> do<00:01:59.930> and<00:02:00.930> there's

00:02:01.130 --> 00:02:01.140 
dimming interior mirrors do and there's

00:02:01.140 --> 00:02:04.730 
dimming interior mirrors do and there's
the<00:02:01.380> interior<00:02:02.130> auto-dimming<00:02:02.640> mirror<00:02:03.740> so

00:02:04.730 --> 00:02:04.740 
the interior auto-dimming mirror so

00:02:04.740 --> 00:02:06.560 
the interior auto-dimming mirror so
overall<00:02:05.100> they've<00:02:05.369> kept<00:02:05.640> everything<00:02:06.119> that<00:02:06.479> was

00:02:06.560 --> 00:02:06.570 
overall they've kept everything that was

00:02:06.570 --> 00:02:09.770 
overall they've kept everything that was
really<00:02:06.869> great<00:02:07.190> about<00:02:08.190> the<00:02:09.179> previous
