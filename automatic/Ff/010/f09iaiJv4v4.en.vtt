00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.430
 hi all friends youtube here is micro 

00:00:02.370 --> 00:00:07.500
 91 the speaker today is the second video 

00:00:05.430 --> 00:00:10.139
 of day and today I bring you another 

00:00:07.500 --> 00:00:12.960
 deck profile yet another deck profile 

00:00:10.139 --> 00:00:14.700
 reading gk file let's start immediately that 

00:00:12.960 --> 00:00:18.720
 I have little battery in the car in the 

00:00:14.700 --> 00:00:22.980
 camera then and then of course 

00:00:18.720 --> 00:00:31.650
 let's start with our three spies three 

00:00:22.980 --> 00:00:35.300
 commanders 3 descendants 3 recruiters e 

00:00:31.650 --> 00:00:39.899
 an axis the ant these were moved then 

00:00:35.300 --> 00:00:47.120
 spurs obviously triple necro valle non 

00:00:39.899 --> 00:00:47.120
 may lack double tribute triple stele 

00:00:47.450 --> 00:00:55.370
 triple pod for fishing more and for 

00:00:50.399 --> 00:01:00.420
 having a little more against is from then on 

00:00:55.370 --> 00:01:06.299
 brigade traps of the solemn 2 warning 

00:01:00.420 --> 00:01:11.400
 in double doubles double omnes trial 

00:01:06.299 --> 00:01:16.920
 tower rather double double bride 

00:01:11.400 --> 00:01:21.450
 fernhill chain mirror double prison e 

00:01:16.920 --> 00:01:28.100
 starlight tech profile 8 fast because 

00:01:21.450 --> 00:01:34.740
 I do not want nor do it then extra 3 utopia 

00:01:28.100 --> 00:01:38.310
 Utopia ray brown teacher milan yes but 

00:01:34.740 --> 00:01:42.390
 what kind is very strong it does 3x3 cadastre 

00:01:38.310 --> 00:01:45.390
 attributes for in the game another though 

00:01:42.390 --> 00:01:49.380
 I didn't take it from a double friend of mine 

00:01:45.390 --> 00:01:51.210
 operational butterflies drunk 3 leviathan le 

00:01:49.380 --> 00:01:53.670
 of haier brilliant physics are made alone 

00:01:51.210 --> 00:01:57.750
 however with recruiters it is better to have them than 

00:01:53.670 --> 00:02:00.240
 no and nothing, this deck is all based 

00:01:57.750 --> 00:02:03.240
 on the micro valley as you know very well it is 

00:02:00.240 --> 00:02:06.080
 a deck in my opinion that gives enough 

00:02:03.240 --> 00:02:10.790
 boredom for example a caus dragon 

00:02:06.080 --> 00:02:13.940
 or to wind up and therefore it is a match 

00:02:10.790 --> 00:02:16.430
 a bunch could be very valid 

00:02:13.940 --> 00:02:18.950
 valid especially after the bennet state 

00:02:16.430 --> 00:02:21.110
 that I don't think they will put negro valley 

00:02:18.950 --> 00:02:23.750
 a stuff like that so it's a bunch 

00:02:21.110 --> 00:02:28.300
 very very strong because it denies al 

00:02:23.750 --> 00:02:30.710
 cemetery therefore very very strong and 

00:02:28.300 --> 00:02:32.780
 playing it is still an anti goal 

00:02:30.710 --> 00:02:34.970
 so it's fun for at least for me from 

00:02:32.780 --> 00:02:38.720
 play even if I have more fun with 

00:02:34.970 --> 00:02:41.750
 the cagata, however, nothing very much 

00:02:38.720 --> 00:02:45.280
 funny also made top 16 and 

00:02:41.750 --> 00:02:47.480
 so something national this year 

00:02:45.280 --> 00:02:50.660
 it means 

00:02:47.480 --> 00:02:53.060
 and this will be the last of the version 

00:02:50.660 --> 00:02:55.520
 my definitive because I have to give it away 

00:02:53.060 --> 00:02:57.950
 this tech I have to sell I have to 

00:02:55.520 --> 00:03:02.150
 give you hyatt to race about who has it to me 

00:02:57.950 --> 00:03:04.880
 asked and then I give it to him and nothing 

00:03:02.150 --> 00:03:07.070
 obviously I'm the base and nothing 

00:03:04.880 --> 00:03:08.959
 this around profile is rather fast 

00:03:07.070 --> 00:03:11.180
 I apologize for the hurry because ve 

00:03:08.959 --> 00:03:12.650
 I explained it either is low battery and then 

00:03:11.180 --> 00:03:14.870
 I also go quite in a hurry that 

00:03:12.650 --> 00:03:17.959
 will want to do enough things and then 

00:03:14.870 --> 00:03:21.790
 nothing for today is all I hope this 

00:03:17.959 --> 00:03:21.790
 I liked this profile 

00:03:21.970 --> 00:03:29.090
 then there is to say the usual things and me 

00:03:24.920 --> 00:03:31.220
 I recommend signing up in many places 

00:03:29.090 --> 00:03:33.350
 I like the video below you support mine 

00:03:31.220 --> 00:03:35.600
 channel finally I'm alone too 

00:03:33.350 --> 00:03:37.400
 reached or even exceeded 100 

00:03:35.600 --> 00:03:41.450
 subscribers therefore could not go 

00:03:37.400 --> 00:03:42.620
 better and nothing is one thing that does not 

00:03:41.450 --> 00:03:44.210
 has nothing to do with the idea but to file 

00:03:42.620 --> 00:03:47.030
 that I wanted to show you that I found 

00:03:44.210 --> 00:03:50.480
 that my teammate tasted 

00:03:47.030 --> 00:03:54.110
 this last dock 6 which is beautiful 

00:03:50.480 --> 00:03:56.450
 it's a taste of phoenix is ​​called in 

00:03:54.110 --> 00:03:59.690
 practice makes me like apple tree says attacked 

00:03:56.450 --> 00:04:03.920
 a monster 28 at times therefore powerful 

00:03:59.690 --> 00:04:05.750
 it is done with two levels 2 and nothing I wanted 

00:04:03.920 --> 00:04:09.140
 to show only that I also have this not 

00:04:05.750 --> 00:04:11.510
 he gives it obviously and therefore or how you have it 

00:04:09.140 --> 00:04:14.930
 seen all three cards that yes 

00:04:11.510 --> 00:04:18.080
 They are mostly all seek nor 

00:04:14.930 --> 00:04:21.230
 in the hidden national six I have them all 

00:04:18.080 --> 00:04:26.120
 therefore the val valinis is missing 

00:04:21.230 --> 00:04:28.130
 I should get there and nothing for 

00:04:26.120 --> 00:04:31.520
 today is everything we see each other 

00:04:28.130 --> 00:04:33.710
 videos that might be two years 

00:04:31.520 --> 00:04:35.510
 or I could after so long real 

00:04:33.710 --> 00:04:38.150
 days the trade I think will be the 

00:04:35.510 --> 00:04:42.260
 right choice and therefore nothing for 

00:04:38.150 --> 00:04:46.580
 today is everything and I remind you of my three 

00:04:42.260 --> 00:04:50.810
 friends with a taste for sigma for le 

00:04:46.580 --> 00:04:55.040
 secret of course of last race 6 

00:04:50.810 --> 00:04:56.630
 I don't know if you see ok you see it puts a 

00:04:55.040 --> 00:05:00.640
 fire focuses 

00:04:56.630 --> 00:05:05.260
