00:00:23.920 --> 00:00:23.930 
now to make year I put lines into this

00:00:23.930 --> 00:00:27.950 
now to make year I put lines into this
bead<00:00:24.930> next<00:00:25.560> to<00:00:25.740> the<00:00:26.039> the<00:00:26.430> eyes<00:00:26.609> so<00:00:27.330> this<00:00:27.630> will

and the easiest way is to just tie right

00:01:02.120 --> 00:01:14.160 
and the easiest way is to just tie right
away<00:01:05.530> so<00:01:06.530> I<00:01:06.590> tie<00:01:07.070> this<00:01:09.490> live<00:01:10.490> alright<00:01:11.350> and

00:01:14.160 --> 00:01:14.170 
away so I tie this live alright and

millimeter crystal beads
the<00:04:54.070> same<00:04:54.310> way<00:04:55.170> put<00:04:56.170> the<00:04:56.500> same<00:04:56.740> line<00:04:57.960> back<00:04:58.960> into

00:04:59.700 --> 00:04:59.710 
the same way put the same line back into

00:04:59.710 --> 00:05:06.370 
the same way put the same line back into
the<00:04:59.890> smoky<00:05:00.310> quartz<00:05:03.000> make<00:05:04.000> this

00:05:06.370 --> 00:05:06.380 

00:05:06.380 --> 00:05:16.100 

and<00:05:07.380> cool

00:05:16.100 --> 00:05:16.110 

00:05:16.110 --> 00:05:19.150 

to<00:05:16.680> make<00:05:16.860> it<00:05:16.980> tight<00:05:17.250> you<00:05:17.280> have<00:05:17.670> to<00:05:17.820> push<00:05:18.150> the

00:05:19.150 --> 00:05:19.160 
to make it tight you have to push the

00:05:19.160 --> 00:05:22.820 
to make it tight you have to push the
smoke<00:05:20.160> across<00:05:20.430> back<00:05:21.290> attached<00:05:22.290> to<00:05:22.560> the<00:05:22.710> other

00:05:22.820 --> 00:05:22.830 
smoke across back attached to the other

00:05:22.830 --> 00:05:30.290 
smoke across back attached to the other
side<00:05:23.190> and<00:05:24.080> pull<00:05:25.080> the<00:05:25.590> line<00:05:28.460> after<00:05:29.460> you<00:05:29.490> finish

00:05:30.290 --> 00:05:30.300 
side and pull the line after you finish

00:05:30.300 --> 00:05:33.160 
side and pull the line after you finish
putting<00:05:30.630> into<00:05:30.960> two<00:05:31.560> legs<00:05:31.830> back<00:05:32.130> here<00:05:32.550> I

00:05:33.160 --> 00:05:33.170 
putting into two legs back here I

00:05:33.170 --> 00:05:41.900 
putting into two legs back here I
suggest<00:05:34.170> to<00:05:34.440> put<00:05:34.680> this<00:05:34.950> line<00:05:35.310> back<00:05:36.270> up<00:05:36.510> top<00:05:40.910> to

00:05:41.900 --> 00:05:41.910 
suggest to put this line back up top to

00:05:41.910 --> 00:05:50.469 
suggest to put this line back up top to
the<00:05:41.940> top<00:05:42.270> like<00:05:42.570> this

00:05:50.469 --> 00:05:50.479 

00:05:50.479 --> 00:05:55.299 

so<00:05:51.110> the<00:05:51.379> legs<00:05:51.620> will<00:05:51.889> be<00:05:52.360> like<00:05:53.360> this<00:05:53.539> one<00:05:54.309> okay

00:05:55.299 --> 00:05:55.309 
so the legs will be like this one okay

00:05:55.309 --> 00:06:00.640 
so the legs will be like this one okay
and<00:05:56.090> the<00:05:56.330> other<00:05:56.449> side<00:05:56.779> the<00:05:57.050> same<00:05:57.229> way<00:05:59.379> put<00:06:00.379> back

00:06:00.640 --> 00:06:00.650 
and the other side the same way put back

00:06:00.650 --> 00:06:10.839 
and the other side the same way put back
up<00:06:00.860> top<00:06:01.069> to<00:06:01.749> the<00:06:02.749> top<00:06:03.729> beats<00:06:07.270> so<00:06:08.270> late<00:06:08.569> we'll<00:06:09.849> go

00:06:10.839 --> 00:06:10.849 
up top to the top beats so late we'll go

00:06:10.849 --> 00:06:13.620 
up top to the top beats so late we'll go
this<00:06:11.029> way

00:06:13.620 --> 00:06:13.630 

00:06:13.630 --> 00:06:19.680
