00:02:12.140 --> 00:02:12.150 
pressing the hands down is there you are

00:02:12.150 --> 00:02:49.040 
pressing the hands down is there you are
imagining<00:02:15.920> away<00:02:16.920> from<00:02:17.190> your<00:02:47.660> build<00:02:48.660> slowly

00:02:49.040 --> 00:02:49.050 
imagining away from your build slowly

00:02:49.050 --> 00:02:51.560 
imagining away from your build slowly
and<00:02:49.560> you're<00:02:49.860> gonna<00:02:50.519> get<00:02:50.700> stronger<00:02:51.090> over<00:02:51.540> time

00:02:51.560 --> 00:02:51.570 
and you're gonna get stronger over time

00:02:51.570 --> 00:02:53.870 
and you're gonna get stronger over time
your<00:02:52.380> muscles<00:02:52.860> are<00:02:53.040> stronger<00:02:53.400> than<00:02:53.670> your

00:02:53.870 --> 00:02:53.880 
your muscles are stronger than your

00:02:53.880 --> 00:02:56.270 
your muscles are stronger than your
wrists<00:02:54.120> right<00:02:54.840> now<00:02:55.050> because<00:02:55.350> muscles<00:02:55.769> take<00:02:56.010> a

00:02:56.270 --> 00:02:56.280 
wrists right now because muscles take a

00:02:56.280 --> 00:03:00.229 
wrists right now because muscles take a
lot<00:02:56.640> less<00:02:56.880> time<00:02:57.269> to<00:02:57.540> build<00:02:58.110> then<00:02:58.500> joints<00:02:59.400> do<00:02:59.700> so

00:03:00.229 --> 00:03:00.239 
lot less time to build then joints do so

00:03:00.239 --> 00:03:01.670 
lot less time to build then joints do so
you<00:03:00.299> want<00:03:00.660> to<00:03:00.750> take<00:03:00.870> your<00:03:01.049> time<00:03:01.320> with<00:03:01.530> your

00:03:01.670 --> 00:03:01.680 
you want to take your time with your

00:03:01.680 --> 00:03:04.220 
you want to take your time with your
joints<00:03:01.920> and<00:03:02.190> allow<00:03:02.489> your<00:03:02.670> joints<00:03:03.030> to<00:03:03.120> get<00:03:03.299> your

00:03:04.220 --> 00:03:04.230 
joints and allow your joints to get your

00:03:04.230 --> 00:03:06.020 
joints and allow your joints to get your
muscles<00:03:04.680> so<00:03:05.010> your<00:03:05.250> body<00:03:05.549> is<00:03:05.820> actually

00:03:06.020 --> 00:03:06.030 
muscles so your body is actually

00:03:06.030 --> 00:03:08.180 
muscles so your body is actually
stronger<00:03:06.690> joints<00:03:07.260> are<00:03:07.380> strengthening<00:03:07.980> and

00:03:08.180 --> 00:03:08.190 
stronger joints are strengthening and

00:03:08.190 --> 00:03:10.370 
stronger joints are strengthening and
you're<00:03:08.310> actually<00:03:08.760> becoming<00:03:08.910> stronger<00:03:09.630> as<00:03:10.049> you

00:03:10.370 --> 00:03:10.380 
you're actually becoming stronger as you

00:03:10.380 --> 00:03:12.680 
you're actually becoming stronger as you
progress<00:03:10.590> into<00:03:10.950> your<00:03:11.160> practice<00:03:11.340> of<00:03:12.329> course

00:03:12.680 --> 00:03:12.690 
progress into your practice of course

00:03:12.690 --> 00:03:16.190 
progress into your practice of course
when<00:03:13.019> you<00:03:13.170> are<00:03:13.200> aligning<00:03:14.810> your<00:03:15.810> race<00:03:16.049> you

00:03:16.190 --> 00:03:16.200 
when you are aligning your race you

00:03:16.200 --> 00:03:17.569 
when you are aligning your race you
wanna<00:03:16.350> pay<00:03:16.530> attention<00:03:16.890> to<00:03:17.010> your<00:03:17.130> shoulders

00:03:17.569 --> 00:03:17.579 
wanna pay attention to your shoulders

00:03:17.579 --> 00:03:19.819 
wanna pay attention to your shoulders
your<00:03:18.180> wrists<00:03:18.450> should<00:03:18.959> always<00:03:19.290> be<00:03:19.620> shoulder

00:03:19.819 --> 00:03:19.829 
your wrists should always be shoulder

00:03:19.829 --> 00:03:22.310 
your wrists should always be shoulder
width<00:03:20.130> apart<00:03:20.160> you<00:03:21.000> should<00:03:21.209> develop<00:03:21.690> the

00:03:22.310 --> 00:03:22.320 
width apart you should develop the

00:03:22.320 --> 00:03:25.250 
width apart you should develop the
connection<00:03:22.970> where<00:03:23.970> your<00:03:24.150> body<00:03:24.480> is<00:03:24.750> in<00:03:24.840> space

00:03:25.250 --> 00:03:25.260 
connection where your body is in space

00:03:25.260 --> 00:03:27.590 
connection where your body is in space
so<00:03:25.829> you<00:03:25.890> should<00:03:26.190> have<00:03:26.400> an<00:03:26.519> idea<00:03:26.910> of<00:03:27.000> how<00:03:27.360> wide

00:03:27.590 --> 00:03:27.600 
so you should have an idea of how wide

00:03:27.600 --> 00:03:29.300 
so you should have an idea of how wide
your<00:03:27.750> shoulders<00:03:28.230> are<00:03:28.470> so<00:03:28.680> that<00:03:28.860> your<00:03:29.040> wrists

00:03:29.300 --> 00:03:29.310 
your shoulders are so that your wrists

00:03:29.310 --> 00:03:31.009 
your shoulders are so that your wrists
are<00:03:29.430> underneath<00:03:29.790> your<00:03:30.090> shoulders<00:03:30.540> but<00:03:30.720> in<00:03:30.900> the

00:03:31.009 --> 00:03:31.019 
are underneath your shoulders but in the
