00:00:00.620 --> 00:00:08.710
 and so now I will show that where 

00:00:03.860 --> 00:00:12.469
 connect start with this one 

00:00:08.710 --> 00:00:20.240
 she put she put so here 

00:00:12.469 --> 00:00:20.930
 under the seat we have here here here here so 

00:00:20.240 --> 00:00:25.580
 with her 

00:00:20.930 --> 00:00:31.599
 confused two diodes will go down with it 

00:00:25.580 --> 00:00:37.780
 so dark here he comes here 

00:00:31.599 --> 00:00:43.749
 visible from him is a brush 

00:00:37.780 --> 00:00:43.749
 brush here we are now clearly this here 

00:00:44.109 --> 00:00:53.449
 the next one here it goes to mass 

00:00:49.149 --> 00:00:57.309
 motorcycle bottom 

00:00:53.449 --> 00:01:05.760
 more precisely the top will stand here this 

00:00:57.309 --> 00:01:13.730
 she goes now we find she goes to the panel 

00:01:05.760 --> 00:01:24.080
 Here in this as the most basic I think 

00:01:13.730 --> 00:01:24.080
 here it is with us x5 it goes now 

00:01:25.590 --> 00:01:36.180
 She goes to the last contact here on 

00:01:29.950 --> 00:01:42.360
 this one is the last one 

00:01:36.180 --> 00:01:42.360
 the following is here we go 

00:01:42.390 --> 00:01:54.360
 She goes when it is put him well 

00:01:48.000 --> 00:02:02.490
 The last sau began after the brush is put 

00:01:54.360 --> 00:02:09.179
 here here on youtube so on here 

00:02:02.490 --> 00:02:14.959
 these here are winding one we go with yet 

00:02:09.179 --> 00:02:21.170
 a brush with here that's going to have it 

00:02:14.959 --> 00:02:25.200
 I have this kind of 11t 

00:02:21.170 --> 00:02:31.350
 he goes here i am from here he goes here on 

00:02:25.200 --> 00:02:32.130
 the bolt on this bolt the two still have it 

00:02:31.350 --> 00:02:38.989
 go too 

00:02:32.130 --> 00:02:46.260
 in the panel that's all nothing complicated 

00:02:38.989 --> 00:02:49.440
 here's the last one 

00:02:46.260 --> 00:02:49.980
 if you have a planet it is empty if you have 

00:02:49.440 --> 00:02:53.190
 you pack 

00:02:49.980 --> 00:02:56.880
 that you have two contacts here will not go away 

00:02:53.190 --> 00:03:00.060
 condensate from it is still on contact 

00:02:56.880 --> 00:03:03.079
 one here on the planet is exactly the same 

00:03:00.060 --> 00:03:03.079
 Once all on one go
