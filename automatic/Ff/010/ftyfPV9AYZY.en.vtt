00:00:24.200 --> 00:00:24.210 
this picture I mean we like this type of

00:00:24.210 --> 00:00:26.929 
this picture I mean we like this type of
style<00:00:24.510> we<00:00:24.810> like<00:00:24.960> this<00:00:25.140> website<00:00:25.730> we<00:00:26.730> really

00:00:26.929 --> 00:00:26.939 
style we like this website we really

00:00:29.089 --> 00:00:29.099 
like this about this website so let's

00:00:29.099 --> 00:00:31.009 
like this about this website so let's
kind<00:00:29.250> of<00:00:29.369> put<00:00:29.580> all<00:00:29.820> this<00:00:29.970> together<00:00:30.150> so<00:00:30.810> in<00:00:30.900> that

00:00:31.009 --> 00:00:31.019 
kind of put all this together so in that

00:00:31.019 --> 00:00:33.139 
kind of put all this together so in that
scenario<00:00:31.230> that's<00:00:31.830> exactly<00:00:32.250> what<00:00:32.369> we<00:00:32.520> do<00:00:32.700> we

00:00:33.139 --> 00:00:33.149 
scenario that's exactly what we do we

00:00:33.149 --> 00:00:35.709 
scenario that's exactly what we do we
combine<00:00:33.600> the<00:00:33.870> elements<00:00:33.899> and<00:00:34.380> we<00:00:34.710> go<00:00:35.370> through

00:00:35.709 --> 00:00:35.719 
combine the elements and we go through

00:00:35.719 --> 00:00:38.209 
combine the elements and we go through
what<00:00:36.719> you<00:00:36.840> were<00:00:36.930> talking<00:00:37.290> about<00:00:37.350> in<00:00:37.710> creating

00:00:38.209 --> 00:00:38.219 
what you were talking about in creating

00:00:38.219 --> 00:00:40.700 
what you were talking about in creating
a<00:00:38.280> package<00:00:38.760> for<00:00:39.030> you<00:00:39.090> that<00:00:39.559> combines<00:00:40.559> all

00:00:40.700 --> 00:00:40.710 
a package for you that combines all

00:00:40.710 --> 00:00:43.040 
a package for you that combines all
those<00:00:40.920> elements<00:00:41.100> so<00:00:42.000> then<00:00:42.120> once<00:00:42.329> we're<00:00:42.540> from

00:00:43.040 --> 00:00:43.050 
those elements so then once we're from

00:00:43.050 --> 00:00:45.139 
those elements so then once we're from
there<00:00:43.290> then<00:00:43.950> that<00:00:44.160> you<00:00:44.250> can<00:00:44.399> actually<00:00:44.610> see<00:00:44.820> it

00:00:45.139 --> 00:00:45.149 
there then that you can actually see it

00:00:45.149 --> 00:00:47.060 
there then that you can actually see it
and<00:00:45.300> we're<00:00:45.420> moving<00:00:45.690> forward<00:00:45.870> visually<00:00:46.469> we

00:00:47.060 --> 00:00:47.070 
and we're moving forward visually we

00:00:47.070 --> 00:00:48.200 
and we're moving forward visually we
have<00:00:47.219> something<00:00:47.579> that's<00:00:47.700> a<00:00:47.789> little<00:00:47.879> bit<00:00:48.030> more

00:00:48.200 --> 00:00:48.210 
have something that's a little bit more

00:00:48.210 --> 00:00:51.920 
have something that's a little bit more
tangible<00:00:49.010> then<00:00:50.010> we<00:00:50.370> fine-tune<00:00:51.360> that<00:00:51.539> design

00:00:51.920 --> 00:00:51.930 
tangible then we fine-tune that design

00:00:51.930 --> 00:00:54.139 
tangible then we fine-tune that design
to<00:00:52.199> exactly<00:00:52.980> what<00:00:53.550> you<00:00:53.670> like<00:00:53.850> and<00:00:54.059> we

00:00:54.139 --> 00:00:54.149 
to exactly what you like and we

00:00:54.149 --> 00:00:55.970 
to exactly what you like and we
understand<00:00:54.570> that<00:00:54.780> a<00:00:55.020> lot<00:00:55.350> of<00:00:55.559> times<00:00:55.829> with

00:00:55.970 --> 00:00:55.980 
understand that a lot of times with

00:00:55.980 --> 00:00:59.540 
understand that a lot of times with
design<00:00:57.199> you<00:00:58.199> know<00:00:58.289> this<00:00:58.590> goes<00:00:58.770> for<00:00:58.920> myself<00:00:59.280> or

00:00:59.540 --> 00:00:59.550 
design you know this goes for myself or

00:00:59.550 --> 00:01:01.430 
design you know this goes for myself or
you<00:00:59.879> know<00:00:59.969> other<00:01:00.090> clients<00:01:00.480> as<00:01:00.570> well<00:01:00.600> sometimes

00:01:01.430 --> 00:01:01.440 
you know other clients as well sometimes

00:01:01.440 --> 00:01:03.319 
you know other clients as well sometimes
you<00:01:02.219> think<00:01:02.250> you're<00:01:02.579> going<00:01:02.699> to<00:01:02.730> like<00:01:02.910> something

00:01:03.319 --> 00:01:03.329 
you think you're going to like something

00:01:03.329 --> 00:01:05.240 
you think you're going to like something
but<00:01:03.480> then<00:01:03.570> when<00:01:03.660> it<00:01:03.750> comes<00:01:03.780> out<00:01:04.170> on<00:01:04.439> paper<00:01:04.890> or

00:01:05.240 --> 00:01:05.250 
but then when it comes out on paper or

00:01:05.250 --> 00:01:06.770 
but then when it comes out on paper or
on<00:01:05.280> the<00:01:05.700> screen<00:01:06.000> it<00:01:06.210> looks<00:01:06.240> a<00:01:06.450> little<00:01:06.570> bit

00:01:06.770 --> 00:01:06.780 
on the screen it looks a little bit

00:01:06.780 --> 00:01:08.270 
on the screen it looks a little bit
different<00:01:07.170> so<00:01:07.350> we<00:01:07.560> understand<00:01:07.950> that's<00:01:08.130> just

00:01:08.270 --> 00:01:08.280 
different so we understand that's just

00:01:08.280 --> 00:01:10.070 
different so we understand that's just
part<00:01:08.460> of<00:01:08.520> the<00:01:08.580> process<00:01:08.760> and<00:01:09.270> we're<00:01:09.869> very

00:01:10.070 --> 00:01:10.080 
part of the process and we're very

00:01:10.080 --> 00:01:13.250 
part of the process and we're very
flexible<00:01:10.260> with<00:01:11.689> fine-tuning<00:01:12.689> your<00:01:12.750> vision

00:01:58.640 --> 00:02:01.039 
touch some people don't which is fine
but<00:01:59.640> we<00:01:59.729> do<00:02:00.090> go<00:02:00.240> with<00:02:00.329> the<00:02:00.390> emails<00:02:00.659> but<00:02:00.780> we<00:02:00.930> do

00:02:01.039 --> 00:02:01.049 
but we do go with the emails but we do

00:02:01.049 --> 00:02:03.499 
but we do go with the emails but we do
prefer<00:02:01.380> to<00:02:01.469> have<00:02:01.619> that<00:02:01.799> personal<00:02:02.250> touch<00:02:02.509> so

00:02:03.499 --> 00:02:03.509 
prefer to have that personal touch so

00:02:03.509 --> 00:02:05.810 
prefer to have that personal touch so
then<00:02:04.110> what<00:02:04.320> we<00:02:04.439> do<00:02:04.619> is<00:02:04.649> we<00:02:05.130> really<00:02:05.369> talked<00:02:05.640> out

00:02:05.810 --> 00:02:05.820 
then what we do is we really talked out

00:02:05.820 --> 00:02:08.660 
then what we do is we really talked out
the<00:02:05.939> ideas<00:02:06.360> go<00:02:07.049> forward<00:02:07.500> create<00:02:07.860> actual<00:02:08.069> a

00:02:08.660 --> 00:02:08.670 
the ideas go forward create actual a

00:02:08.670 --> 00:02:11.990 
the ideas go forward create actual a
couple<00:02:09.179> of<00:02:09.239> concepts<00:02:09.840> so<00:02:10.679> our<00:02:11.220> client<00:02:11.610> can<00:02:11.760> see

00:02:11.990 --> 00:02:12.000 
couple of concepts so our client can see

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:13.520 
couple of concepts so our client can see
and<00:02:12.180> start<00:02:12.360> seeing<00:02:12.599> it<00:02:12.720> visually<00:02:13.080> we<00:02:13.200> believe

00:02:13.520 --> 00:02:13.530 
and start seeing it visually we believe

00:02:13.530 --> 00:02:15.050 
and start seeing it visually we believe
presenting<00:02:14.160> them<00:02:14.340> with<00:02:14.370> things<00:02:14.730> instead<00:02:15.000> of

00:02:15.050 --> 00:02:15.060 
presenting them with things instead of

00:02:15.060 --> 00:02:17.809 
presenting them with things instead of
just<00:02:15.150> talking<00:02:15.540> about<00:02:15.780> ideas<00:02:16.459> so<00:02:17.459> then<00:02:17.640> you

00:02:17.809 --> 00:02:17.819 
just talking about ideas so then you

00:02:17.819 --> 00:02:20.059 
just talking about ideas so then you
then<00:02:18.330> we're<00:02:18.600> at<00:02:18.959> the<00:02:19.230> scenario<00:02:19.590> where<00:02:19.800> you<00:02:19.920> can

00:02:20.059 --> 00:02:20.069 
then we're at the scenario where you can

00:02:20.069 --> 00:02:21.860 
then we're at the scenario where you can
see<00:02:20.310> what<00:02:20.520> you<00:02:20.580> like<00:02:20.819> I<00:02:21.090> like<00:02:21.330> this<00:02:21.540> like<00:02:21.840> that

00:02:21.860 --> 00:02:21.870 
see what you like I like this like that

00:02:21.870 --> 00:02:24.320 
see what you like I like this like that
let's<00:02:22.410> move<00:02:22.530> combine<00:02:22.890> these<00:02:23.190> and<00:02:23.550> then<00:02:23.970> we<00:02:24.150> go

00:02:24.320 --> 00:02:24.330 
let's move combine these and then we go

00:02:24.330 --> 00:02:26.510 
let's move combine these and then we go
forward<00:02:24.720> from<00:02:24.810> there<00:02:25.200> so<00:02:26.069> like<00:02:26.280> I<00:02:26.459> said

00:02:26.510 --> 00:02:26.520 
forward from there so like I said

00:02:26.520 --> 00:02:29.120 
forward from there so like I said
