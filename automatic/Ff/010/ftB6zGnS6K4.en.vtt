00:01:03.650 --> 00:01:03.660 
less around the whole park which i think

00:01:03.660 --> 00:01:06.350 
less around the whole park which i think
is<00:01:04.019> really<00:01:04.890> good<00:01:05.250> option<00:01:05.700> if<00:01:05.790> you<00:01:05.939> don't<00:01:06.119> have

a<00:01:10.140> good<00:01:10.619> thing<00:01:11.100> here<00:01:11.340> in<00:01:11.520> Busch<00:01:11.670> Gardens<00:01:11.700> I

00:01:12.350 --> 00:01:12.360 
a good thing here in Busch Gardens I

00:01:12.360 --> 00:01:14.870
