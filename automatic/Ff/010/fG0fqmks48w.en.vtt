 also doing some works in the state of baja california being

 and in the north of the country we are also working for example modernization 

00:02:13.659 --> 00:02:16.129

00:02:20.239 --> 00:02:23.519
 now for the part of the projects we are doing with private investment 

00:02:24.179 --> 00:02:26.450
 the most important ones maybe 

00:02:26.450 --> 00:02:29.779
 jean the northern highway of the city of mexico that is 

00:02:29.779 --> 00:02:32.779
 about to finish a very important first stage 

00:02:33.349 --> 00:02:35.519
 the Mexico-Tuxpan highway 

00:02:35.519 --> 00:02:39.430
 a road that we are building between green river san luis potosí and 

00:02:39.430 --> 00:02:42.669
 city ​​valleys san luis potosí which is also an axis of access to 

00:02:43.279 --> 00:02:45.819
 to the city of the port of tampico 

00:02:45.819 --> 00:02:48.819
 we are in a new letter between monterrey and saltillo 

00:02:49.409 --> 00:02:52.870
 we have an international bridge is also close to finish in the 

00:02:52.870 --> 00:02:54.329
 City of Reynosa 

00:02:54.329 --> 00:02:59.239
 percent we are moving forward as quickly the highway consumes 

00:02:59.239 --> 00:03:02.679
 arriaga aoc or its amount in the state of Chiapas 

00:03:02.679 --> 00:03:06.669
 percent and we have to the thread of this is a no 

00:03:06.669 --> 00:03:10.489
 package of 17 works of public-private partnership 

00:03:10.489 --> 00:03:14.719
 are currently underway very broad package so I was not practicing 

00:03:14.719 --> 00:03:18.779
 your undersecretaries and here it's worth asking yourself or what happens and man me 

00:03:18.779 --> 00:03:19.859
 it seems that it is vital 

00:03:19.859 --> 00:03:23.780
 the president just a few weeks ago announces the national agreement 

00:03:23.779 --> 00:03:27.979
 in favor of the economy with the family and employment and within them this support 

00:03:27.979 --> 00:03:32.150
 to temporary employment there is inscribed percent 

00:03:32.150 --> 00:03:36.769
 good all these works and the budget that we are exercising will undoubtedly be 

00:03:36.769 --> 00:03:40.189
 generating a very significant number of jobs 

00:03:40.189 --> 00:03:44.099
 a part a specific program that we have within 

00:03:44.099 --> 00:03:47.680
 he is what we have to do this year that called pet the program of 

00:03:47.680 --> 00:03:48.859
 temporary employment 

00:03:48.859 --> 00:03:53.439
 This is a program designed to generate employment especially in areas 

00:03:53.439 --> 00:03:54.409
 rural 

00:03:54.409 --> 00:03:58.989
 where in times when there is no harvest when there are no agricultural activities 

00:03:58.989 --> 00:04:02.129
 they reduce the opportunities to be employed 

00:04:02.129 --> 00:04:05.129
 the program is designed to generate work 

00:04:05.659 --> 00:04:08.920
 for rural communities in work related to 

00:04:09.519 --> 00:04:13.150
 the maintenance cleaning the conservation of rural roads and 

00:04:13.150 --> 00:04:14.409
 feeders that 

00:04:14.409 --> 00:04:15.779
 that exist out there 

00:04:15.779 --> 00:04:18.709
 percent the idea is that through this program 

00:04:18.709 --> 00:04:22.630
 a series of job opportunities are generated 

00:04:22.630 --> 00:04:24.879
 for people in rural areas 

00:04:24.879 --> 00:04:29.590
 normally in marginalized areas and that helps to balance the possible 

00:04:29.589 --> 00:04:30.480
 work 

00:04:30.480 --> 00:04:34.630
 in those places you have an estimate of how many jobs they could generate if 

00:04:34.630 --> 00:04:39.380
 we estimate percent in total in the road infrastructure program 

00:04:39.380 --> 00:04:42.050
 we are talking in the course of this year 

00:04:42.050 --> 00:04:45.400
 a figure of around 350 thousand jobs 

00:04:45.400 --> 00:04:50.610
 of which around 200 thousand 210 thousand would be temporary employment 

00:04:50.610 --> 00:04:53.470
 and the rest is linked to the works we do 

00:04:53.470 --> 00:04:56.389
 its all kinds in it in the road sector 

00:04:56.389 --> 00:04:59.409
 Oscar of good undersecretary of infrastructure highway of the sct 

00:04:59.409 --> 00:05:01.229
 many times for these crimes 

00:05:01.229 --> 00:05:03.460
 on the contrary thank you very much for your interest 

00:05:03.460 --> 00:05:04.870
 we continue in Mexico a day
