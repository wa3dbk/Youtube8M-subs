00:01:11.340 --> 00:01:12.859 
middle-of-the-road entry-level DSLR
camera<00:01:11.790> should<00:01:12.000> be<00:01:12.060> comparable<00:01:12.479> to<00:01:12.630> most

00:01:12.859 --> 00:01:12.869 
camera should be comparable to most

00:01:12.869 --> 00:01:16.039 
camera should be comparable to most
DSLRs<00:01:13.799> or<00:01:14.180> camcorders<00:01:15.180> out<00:01:15.360> there<00:01:15.600> that<00:01:15.840> have

00:01:16.039 --> 00:01:16.049 
DSLRs or camcorders out there that have

00:01:16.049 --> 00:01:18.890 
DSLRs or camcorders out there that have
an<00:01:16.320> audio<00:01:16.979> input<00:01:17.189> jack<00:01:17.580> so<00:01:17.970> before<00:01:18.360> we<00:01:18.479> do<00:01:18.659> that

00:01:18.890 --> 00:01:18.900 
an audio input jack so before we do that

00:01:18.900 --> 00:01:20.330 
an audio input jack so before we do that
before<00:01:19.200> we<00:01:19.439> test<00:01:19.650> it<00:01:19.830> we're<00:01:19.950> going<00:01:20.070> to<00:01:20.159> just

00:01:20.330 --> 00:01:20.340 
before we test it we're going to just

00:01:20.340 --> 00:01:26.780 
before we test it we're going to just
turn<00:01:20.520> them<00:01:20.670> both<00:01:20.820> on<00:01:21.060> here<00:01:22.520> and<00:01:25.130> now<00:01:26.130> the

00:01:26.780 --> 00:01:26.790 
turn them both on here and now the

00:01:26.790 --> 00:01:29.090 
turn them both on here and now the
moment<00:01:27.210> of<00:01:27.270> truth<00:01:27.330> the<00:01:28.110> mattress<00:01:28.710> should

00:01:29.090 --> 00:01:29.100 
moment of truth the mattress should

00:01:29.100 --> 00:01:31.670 
moment of truth the mattress should
hopefully<00:01:29.509> dampen<00:01:30.509> any<00:01:30.750> noise<00:01:31.140> and<00:01:31.500> prove

00:01:31.670 --> 00:01:31.680 
hopefully dampen any noise and prove

00:01:31.680 --> 00:01:33.770 
hopefully dampen any noise and prove
that<00:01:31.710> the<00:01:32.220> sound<00:01:32.430> from<00:01:32.610> one<00:01:32.820> is<00:01:33.030> not<00:01:33.509> just

00:01:33.770 --> 00:01:33.780 
that the sound from one is not just

00:01:33.780 --> 00:01:35.480 
that the sound from one is not just
bleed<00:01:34.020> through<00:01:34.259> from<00:01:34.470> the<00:01:34.590> other<00:01:34.619> so<00:01:35.130> anyways

00:01:35.480 --> 00:01:35.490 
bleed through from the other so anyways

00:01:35.490 --> 00:01:40.060 
bleed through from the other so anyways
let's<00:01:35.909> plug<00:01:36.509> it<00:01:36.630> in<00:01:36.720> and<00:01:36.869> see<00:01:36.960> how<00:01:37.049> it<00:01:37.110> works

00:01:40.060 --> 00:01:40.070 

00:01:40.070 --> 00:01:42.530 

alright<00:01:41.070> we<00:01:41.280> are<00:01:41.400> now<00:01:41.640> testing<00:01:42.030> our

00:01:42.530 --> 00:01:42.540 
alright we are now testing our

00:01:42.540 --> 00:01:46.910 
alright we are now testing our
microphone<00:01:43.439> on<00:01:43.860> the<00:01:44.579> right<00:01:44.790> side<00:01:45.920> testing

testing<00:01:47.220> testing<00:01:47.549> and<00:01:48.000> now<00:01:48.540> we're<00:01:48.810> going<00:01:48.899> to

00:01:48.950 --> 00:01:48.960 
testing testing and now we're going to

00:01:48.960 --> 00:01:52.819 
testing testing and now we're going to
run<00:01:49.079> over<00:01:49.229> here<00:01:49.439> and<00:01:50.689> test<00:01:51.689> our<00:01:51.899> microphone<00:01:52.409> on

00:01:52.819 --> 00:01:52.829 
run over here and test our microphone on

00:01:52.829 --> 00:01:56.270 
run over here and test our microphone on
the<00:01:52.860> left<00:01:53.700> side<00:01:54.470> testing<00:01:55.470> testing<00:01:55.920> testing

00:01:56.270 --> 00:01:56.280 
the left side testing testing testing

00:01:56.280 --> 00:01:56.899

alright<00:01:57.360> as<00:01:57.509> we<00:01:57.570> just<00:01:58.170> saw<00:01:58.500> the<00:01:58.920> two<00:01:59.579> ATR<00:02:00.270> 3350

00:02:01.160 --> 00:02:01.170 
alright as we just saw the two ATR 3350

00:02:01.170 --> 00:02:03.830 
alright as we just saw the two ATR 3350
s<00:02:01.469> run<00:02:01.860> through<00:02:02.430> the<00:02:02.909> Belkin<00:02:03.450> channel

00:02:03.830 --> 00:02:03.840

splitter<00:02:04.079> into<00:02:04.619> our<00:02:04.860> sony<00:02:05.070> alpha<00:02:05.310> 55<00:02:05.939> worked

00:02:06.770 --> 00:02:06.780 
splitter into our sony alpha 55 worked

00:02:06.780 --> 00:02:09.080 
splitter into our sony alpha 55 worked
and<00:02:07.110> it<00:02:07.439> worked<00:02:07.590> pretty<00:02:07.770> well<00:02:07.950> I<00:02:08.280> gotta<00:02:08.819> point

00:02:09.080 --> 00:02:09.090 
and it worked pretty well I gotta point

00:02:09.090 --> 00:02:11.479 
and it worked pretty well I gotta point
out<00:02:09.270> it's<00:02:09.420> not<00:02:09.479> an<00:02:09.869> ideal<00:02:10.500> solution<00:02:10.860> of

00:02:11.479 --> 00:02:11.489 
out it's not an ideal solution of

00:02:11.489 --> 00:02:13.460 
out it's not an ideal solution of
because<00:02:11.910> there<00:02:12.420> are<00:02:12.510> a<00:02:12.540> few<00:02:12.690> things<00:02:12.900> like<00:02:13.230> if

00:02:13.460 --> 00:02:13.470 
because there are a few things like if

00:02:13.470 --> 00:02:13.940 
because there are a few things like if
you<00:02:13.650> have

00:02:13.940 --> 00:02:13.950 
you have

00:02:13.950 --> 00:02:16.369 
you have
two<00:02:14.430> subjects<00:02:15.180> that<00:02:15.270> you<00:02:15.420> were<00:02:15.480> recording<00:02:15.780> who

00:02:16.369 --> 00:02:16.379 
two subjects that you were recording who

00:02:16.379 --> 00:02:18.470 
two subjects that you were recording who
were<00:02:16.590> speaking<00:02:16.860> at<00:02:17.190> much<00:02:17.400> different<00:02:18.000> levels

00:02:18.470 --> 00:02:18.480 
were speaking at much different levels

00:02:18.480 --> 00:02:22.070 
were speaking at much different levels
then<00:02:18.959> obviously<00:02:19.550> both<00:02:20.550> of<00:02:20.580> them<00:02:21.300> are<00:02:21.569> going<00:02:21.780> on

00:02:22.070 --> 00:02:22.080 
then obviously both of them are going on

00:02:22.080 --> 00:02:24.080 
then obviously both of them are going on
to<00:02:22.319> the<00:02:22.440> same<00:02:22.650> audio<00:02:23.069> channel<00:02:23.550> so<00:02:23.760> you<00:02:23.849> could

00:02:24.080 --> 00:02:24.090 
to the same audio channel so you could

00:02:24.090 --> 00:02:25.610 
to the same audio channel so you could
end<00:02:24.239> up<00:02:24.300> with<00:02:24.480> some<00:02:24.690> problems<00:02:25.110> there<00:02:25.319> if<00:02:25.470> one

00:02:25.610 --> 00:02:25.620 
end up with some problems there if one

00:02:25.620 --> 00:02:26.660 
end up with some problems there if one
was<00:02:25.739> a<00:02:25.769> lot<00:02:26.010> louder<00:02:26.160> than<00:02:26.430> the<00:02:26.519> other

00:02:26.660 --> 00:02:26.670 
was a lot louder than the other

00:02:26.670 --> 00:02:27.890 
was a lot louder than the other
basically<00:02:27.090> you<00:02:27.239> can't<00:02:27.450> control<00:02:27.750> them

00:02:27.890 --> 00:02:27.900 
basically you can't control them

00:02:27.900 --> 00:02:31.160 
basically you can't control them
independently<00:02:28.470> but<00:02:29.280> if<00:02:29.569> you're<00:02:30.569> crunched<00:02:30.989> for

00:02:31.160 --> 00:02:31.170 
independently but if you're crunched for

00:02:31.170 --> 00:02:34.430 
independently but if you're crunched for
cash<00:02:31.380> or<00:02:31.800> time<00:02:32.340> this<00:02:32.760> is<00:02:33.030> actually<00:02:33.599> a<00:02:34.019> very

00:02:34.430 --> 00:02:34.440 
cash or time this is actually a very

00:02:34.440 --> 00:02:37.550 
cash or time this is actually a very
workable<00:02:35.190> solution<00:02:36.000> for<00:02:36.269> recording<00:02:37.080> dialogue

00:02:37.550 --> 00:02:37.560 
workable solution for recording dialogue

00:02:37.560 --> 00:02:40.309 
workable solution for recording dialogue
