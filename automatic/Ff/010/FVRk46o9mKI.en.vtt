phone call and it changes it live so if

00:01:32.189 --> 00:01:33.350 
phone call and it changes it live so if
you<00:01:32.220> first<00:01:32.579> you<00:01:32.729> want<00:01:32.880> to<00:01:32.939> start<00:01:33.119> out<00:01:33.210> with

00:01:33.350 --> 00:01:33.360 
you first you want to start out with

00:01:35.300 --> 00:01:35.310 
Dark Lord and you start talking as Dark

00:01:35.310 --> 00:01:36.950 
Dark Lord and you start talking as Dark
Lord<00:01:35.610> you<00:01:35.790> can<00:01:35.909> change<00:01:36.180> it<00:01:36.299> to<00:01:36.329> Smurfs<00:01:36.720> and

00:01:36.950 --> 00:01:36.960 
Lord you can change it to Smurfs and

00:01:36.960 --> 00:01:38.539 
Lord you can change it to Smurfs and
then<00:01:37.049> if<00:01:37.140> they're<00:01:37.290> just<00:01:37.470> like<00:01:37.650> okay<00:01:37.920> dude<00:01:38.400> I

00:01:38.539 --> 00:01:38.549 
then if they're just like okay dude I

00:01:38.549 --> 00:01:40.370 
then if they're just like okay dude I
can't<00:01:38.850> understand<00:01:39.420> what<00:01:39.720> you're<00:01:39.900> saying<00:01:39.960> you

00:01:40.370 --> 00:01:40.380 
can't understand what you're saying you

00:01:40.380 --> 00:01:42.140 
can't understand what you're saying you
can<00:01:40.500> go<00:01:40.619> ahead<00:01:40.740> and<00:01:40.890> change<00:01:41.220> it<00:01:41.310> to<00:01:41.460> normal<00:01:41.880> or

00:01:42.140 --> 00:01:42.150 
can go ahead and change it to normal or

00:01:42.150 --> 00:01:44.560 
can go ahead and change it to normal or
you<00:01:42.450> can<00:01:42.570> go<00:01:42.720> back<00:01:42.899> out<00:01:43.079> here<00:01:43.350> and<00:01:43.560> disable<00:01:44.399> it

00:01:44.560 --> 00:01:44.570 
you can go back out here and disable it

00:01:44.570 --> 00:01:47.240 
you can go back out here and disable it
so<00:01:45.570> it's<00:01:45.720> kind<00:01:45.869> of<00:01:45.960> just<00:01:46.140> like<00:01:46.259> a<00:01:46.320> fun<00:01:46.770> tweak

00:01:47.240 --> 00:01:47.250 
so it's kind of just like a fun tweak

00:01:47.250 --> 00:01:48.530 
so it's kind of just like a fun tweak
it's<00:01:47.520> not<00:01:47.700> something<00:01:48.210> that<00:01:48.329> you<00:01:48.450> could

00:01:48.530 --> 00:01:48.540 
it's not something that you could

00:01:48.540 --> 00:01:50.780 
it's not something that you could
probably<00:01:48.750> use<00:01:49.110> on<00:01:49.140> a<00:01:49.320> daily<00:01:49.560> basis<00:01:50.189> but<00:01:50.670> it's

00:01:50.780 --> 00:01:50.790 
probably use on a daily basis but it's

00:01:50.790 --> 00:01:51.770 
probably use on a daily basis but it's
