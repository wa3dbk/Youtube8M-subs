00:00:47.710 --> 00:00:52.750
 for explanation at the brewing level 

00:00:51.010 --> 00:00:55.720
 of the artificial incubator and the 

00:00:52.750 --> 00:00:57.399
 brewing so here is so I'm 

00:00:55.720 --> 00:00:58.780
 sorry I show you the end yeah that's 

00:00:57.399 --> 00:00:59.110
 the end you see it's the end of the 

00:00:58.780 --> 00:01:01.210
 video 

00:00:59.110 --> 00:01:04.390
 in fact but hey you do not worry he 

00:01:01.210 --> 00:01:05.259
 will be up to sion in the three 

00:01:04.390 --> 00:01:08.020
 four minutes after 

00:01:05.259 --> 00:01:10.090
 so here's listen here you've seen the 

00:01:08.020 --> 00:01:11.080
 result in fact well ben did you see the 

00:01:10.090 --> 00:01:14.920
 result I do not have everything that has 

00:01:11.080 --> 00:01:15.520
 past but here's watching that it's 

00:01:14.920 --> 00:01:16.960
 really great 

00:01:15.520 --> 00:01:18.970
 it's really great great i'm 

00:01:16.960 --> 00:01:21.520
 very happy with the result so bah you 

00:01:18.970 --> 00:01:24.460
 can see one of suckers a 

00:01:21.520 --> 00:01:26.110
 bottle a rubber band a sticky two 

00:01:24.460 --> 00:01:27.789
 elastics speaking so much for me two 

00:01:26.110 --> 00:01:29.679
 elastics a pantyhose and the little 

00:01:27.789 --> 00:01:32.229
 green strainer in othe and the goal their 

00:01:29.679 --> 00:01:34.630
 pipes and then diffuser here are two 

00:01:32.229 --> 00:01:37.410
 cupping so you make toulon the 

00:01:34.630 --> 00:01:40.720
 bottle you put the suckers 1 and 

00:01:37.410 --> 00:01:41.950
 the sticky course in bar and 

00:01:40.720 --> 00:01:43.869
 the elastic around the pantyhose 

00:01:41.950 --> 00:01:44.679
 frankly it's great I'm good 

00:01:43.869 --> 00:01:46.530
 pleased with the result 

00:01:44.679 --> 00:01:49.300
 so I spit the female again 

00:01:46.530 --> 00:01:51.280
 to see it I spat the 

00:01:49.300 --> 00:01:53.409
 female there is 

00:01:51.280 --> 00:01:55.150
 it's been 15 days since having the fry 

00:01:53.409 --> 00:01:56.590
 in the mouth so here I did not want to 

00:01:55.150 --> 00:01:58.420
 albums really form and so I 

00:01:56.590 --> 00:02:02.830
 not waited for the 25 days the goal it was 

00:01:58.420 --> 00:02:03.960
 of course to have the female who 

00:02:02.830 --> 00:02:07.890
 I have you 

00:02:03.960 --> 00:02:09.030
 who gives you his little ones with the belly 

00:02:07.890 --> 00:02:12.000
 alger would have had eggs stop on 

00:02:09.030 --> 00:02:13.350
 bio a toy a really do it right from the 

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:13.590
 departure with the eyes but hey it's not 

00:02:13.350 --> 00:02:16.740
 serious 

00:02:13.590 --> 00:02:19.140
 already I found the small solution that 

00:02:16.740 --> 00:02:19.860
 I do not think we were more than one of 

00:02:19.140 --> 00:02:21.209
 you 

00:02:19.860 --> 00:02:23.069
 so it's not so aesthetic but 

00:02:21.209 --> 00:02:27.600
 good if it can help the evolution of 

00:02:23.069 --> 00:02:29.310
 some alvin and hatching eggs 

00:02:27.600 --> 00:02:30.270
 healthy because a 

00:02:29.310 --> 00:02:33.330
 we know that there are some who 

00:02:30.270 --> 00:02:35.910
 misery with the pediments that I do not know 

00:02:33.330 --> 00:02:37.170
 not an axis so here it is just like me 

00:02:35.910 --> 00:02:39.180
 of course I'm kidding 

00:02:37.170 --> 00:02:41.430
 so here's what as you can 

00:02:39.180 --> 00:02:43.280
 to see it is really great 

00:02:41.430 --> 00:02:46.920
 the little precise system we look at and 

00:02:43.280 --> 00:02:48.810
 see there and the goal was precisely 

00:02:46.920 --> 00:02:51.540
 to have these movements there and not the 

00:02:48.810 --> 00:02:54.330
 see when we go on some videos or 

00:02:51.540 --> 00:02:57.420
 artificial incubators people have 

00:02:54.330 --> 00:02:58.440
 intermittently rising water 

00:02:57.420 --> 00:03:00.390
 mounted raids raids 

00:02:58.440 --> 00:03:02.760
 watch this is really great 

00:03:00.390 --> 00:03:05.630
 so we had to the guest who set 

00:03:02.760 --> 00:03:08.760
 between us and then the video 

00:03:05.630 --> 00:03:11.100
 So here is the snail so it's 

00:03:08.760 --> 00:03:13.140
 the screens we will fix it and therefore 

00:03:11.100 --> 00:03:14.790
 here you see this little brewing that 

00:03:13.140 --> 00:03:16.500
 is really really slowly is 

00:03:14.790 --> 00:03:20.880
 really perfectly so I settled the 

00:03:16.500 --> 00:03:23.430
 brewing of course I put the brewing has 

00:03:20.880 --> 00:03:25.709
 really aubigny invisible mode 

00:03:23.430 --> 00:03:27.150
 this way of speaking minimum we 

00:03:25.709 --> 00:03:28.709
 would not move but here I am 

00:03:27.150 --> 00:03:31.260
 happy so you see that it brews 

00:03:28.709 --> 00:03:32.760
 alright so here we see we see 

00:03:31.260 --> 00:03:34.500
 also the pantyhose and where I am 

00:03:32.760 --> 00:03:37.650
 sorry this is my first rather live 

00:03:34.500 --> 00:03:39.510
 like that so I do not want too much if he 

00:03:37.650 --> 00:03:42.410
 there are some small problems at 

00:03:39.510 --> 00:03:45.480
 sound level and wau level 2 1 

00:03:42.410 --> 00:03:47.400
 I stay so that's good then you 

00:03:45.480 --> 00:03:49.680
 can see it my pipe has passed 

00:03:47.400 --> 00:03:51.269
 through the bottle with the diffuser 

00:03:49.680 --> 00:03:52.040
 good you put it where you want in 

00:03:51.269 --> 00:03:55.170
 top to bottom 

00:03:52.040 --> 00:03:56.700
 no matter one everything works well you 

00:03:55.170 --> 00:03:58.109
 see in water the small green colander 

00:03:56.700 --> 00:04:00.150
 you can find them by three or 

00:03:58.109 --> 00:04:01.920
 four in all shops 1 for 1 or 2 

00:04:00.150 --> 00:04:04.230
 euros 16 years ago by 3 normally 

00:04:01.920 --> 00:04:07.069
 for 2 euros I found that in a 

00:04:04.230 --> 00:04:10.219
 brick brac I did not do it can 

00:04:07.069 --> 00:04:13.129
 advertising I'm not tf1 or m6 so 

00:04:10.219 --> 00:04:15.530
 So here we go, look at this a little 

00:04:13.129 --> 00:04:16.759
 little is good it's really great 

00:04:15.530 --> 00:04:17.209
 Frankly I am very happy 

00:04:16.759 --> 00:04:20.209
 result 

00:04:17.209 --> 00:04:21.680
 so good the fry apparently according to 

00:04:20.209 --> 00:04:23.150
 what I saw my female it was 15 

00:04:21.680 --> 00:04:24.800
 calais days stood like I told you 

00:04:23.150 --> 00:04:27.800
 I would have had them I could have done 

00:04:24.800 --> 00:04:29.630
 have the e1 can really do it and 

00:04:27.800 --> 00:04:32.599
 look at the trick and ben that's all 

00:04:29.630 --> 00:04:33.889
 I just had big bubbles 

00:04:32.599 --> 00:04:35.539
 that came out of a sudden compared to the 

00:04:33.889 --> 00:04:36.889
 colander it came out at times that 

00:04:35.539 --> 00:04:38.180
 stopped the fry go up and 

00:04:36.889 --> 00:04:40.190
 come down climbs came down that 

00:04:38.180 --> 00:04:42.590
 did not interest me at all I wanted 

00:04:40.190 --> 00:04:42.770
 here you see I am having fun clogging the 

00:04:42.590 --> 00:04:45.139
 hole 

00:04:42.770 --> 00:04:48.229
 here I am blocking you there really is it 

00:04:45.139 --> 00:04:50.330
 I move him so much and look here 

00:04:48.229 --> 00:04:51.710
 and the trick if you look at the bulls gold 

00:04:50.330 --> 00:04:53.180
 still where it's big 

00:04:51.710 --> 00:04:55.340
 bubbles at once you see that makes 

00:04:53.180 --> 00:04:58.669
 so light that we do not even see 

00:04:55.340 --> 00:05:01.250
 waters move so that's so look at I 

00:04:58.669 --> 00:05:02.449
 release then camera bad please 

00:05:01.250 --> 00:05:04.009

00:05:09.889 --> 00:05:14.599
