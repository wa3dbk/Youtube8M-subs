 the game is shown here 

00:00:30.570 --> 00:00:36.210
 details a lot of details are very small 

00:00:34.100 --> 00:00:37.770
 a large number of them of course 

00:00:36.210 --> 00:00:40.440
 booklet attached 

00:00:37.770 --> 00:00:41.930
 son friend stands with collection instructions 

00:00:40.440 --> 00:00:45.449
 this common 

00:00:41.930 --> 00:00:47.910
 Here, for example, the first page of man 

00:00:45.449 --> 00:00:50.789
 can be collected from behind with him 

00:00:47.910 --> 00:00:51.179
 gas mask here you can try 

00:00:50.789 --> 00:00:54.570
 to collect 

00:00:51.179 --> 00:01:02.760
 Circuits here hand men dress 

00:00:54.570 --> 00:01:07.320
 we put a gas mask on the back too 

00:01:02.760 --> 00:01:10.799
 so further means we are looking for feet 

00:01:07.320 --> 00:01:16.280
 attach, we have a man here at 

00:01:10.799 --> 00:01:19.259
 his hands spin up and down 

00:01:16.280 --> 00:01:22.320
 rotates the brush but 360 degrees 

00:01:19.259 --> 00:01:24.540
 head naturally spinning and legs 

00:01:22.320 --> 00:01:30.659
 separate 1 and 2 white 

00:01:24.540 --> 00:01:34.049
 legs then vice versa here legs 1 2 move 

00:01:30.659 --> 00:01:36.840
 in different directions so it may even like 

00:01:34.049 --> 00:01:39.270
 would imitate running here 

00:01:36.840 --> 00:01:41.030
 such a little man can give him 

00:01:39.270 --> 00:01:46.259
 anything in hand 

00:01:41.030 --> 00:01:51.180
 example to collect a fire extinguisher here give

 man in such a complete set 

00:02:34.530 --> 00:02:41.700
 collected and a large number still 

00:02:37.380 --> 00:02:44.010
 rubber wheels are soft and malleable then 

00:02:41.700 --> 00:02:46.920
 there are very similar to the natural thing 

00:02:44.010 --> 00:02:53.300
 further example shows how to collect in 

00:02:46.920 --> 00:02:56.870
 San ATV full cycle cycle assembly 

00:02:53.300 --> 00:02:56.870
 step-by-step instruction 

00:03:01.750 --> 00:03:12.860
 There are a lot of steps, so something happens 

00:03:06.980 --> 00:03:15.890
 think finished design which 

00:03:12.860 --> 00:03:18.950
 get an example you can start the assembly 

00:03:15.890 --> 00:03:22.610
 Again, take 1 of 1 of the proposed 

00:03:18.950 --> 00:03:32.530
 elements and fasten to him such here 

00:03:22.610 --> 00:03:32.530
 cubic parts 1 and 2 

00:03:33.890 --> 00:03:37.909
 look further here we fix it 

00:03:36.690 --> 00:03:42.540
 now attached 

00:03:37.909 --> 00:03:49.319
 long detail in this way to her 

00:03:42.540 --> 00:03:51.599
 mounted 2 part rear acer wheel that's 

00:03:49.319 --> 00:03:56.540
