expanding<00:00:26.039> back<00:00:26.369> out<00:00:27.710> that<00:00:28.710> shock<00:00:28.980> absorber

00:00:29.419 --> 00:00:29.429 
expanding back out that shock absorber

00:00:29.429 --> 00:00:32.690 
expanding back out that shock absorber
is<00:00:29.519> bad<00:00:31.520> okay

00:00:32.690 --> 00:00:32.700

now<00:00:32.880> the<00:00:32.940> new<00:00:33.180> shock<00:00:33.420> absorber<00:00:33.840> sub<00:00:34.050> shock

00:00:34.310 --> 00:00:34.320 
now the new shock absorber sub shock

00:00:34.320 --> 00:00:38.680 
now the new shock absorber sub shock
observers<00:00:34.850> have<00:00:35.850> a<00:00:36.260> like<00:00:37.260> a<00:00:37.290> tie<00:00:37.559> wrap<00:00:37.860> going

00:00:38.680 --> 00:00:38.690 
observers have a like a tie wrap going

00:00:38.690 --> 00:00:41.180 
observers have a like a tie wrap going
from<00:00:39.690> end<00:00:39.930> to<00:00:39.989> end<00:00:40.170> here<00:00:40.559> that<00:00:40.800> keeps<00:00:41.040> it

00:00:41.180 --> 00:00:41.190 
from end to end here that keeps it

00:00:41.190 --> 00:00:43.400 
from end to end here that keeps it
collapsed<00:00:41.700> so<00:00:42.420> that<00:00:42.600> you<00:00:42.690> can<00:00:42.870> install<00:00:43.200> it

collapsed so that you can install it

00:00:43.410 --> 00:00:46.040 
collapsed so that you can install it
once<00:00:43.710> it's<00:00:43.950> installed<00:00:44.420> you<00:00:45.420> cut<00:00:45.660> that<00:00:45.809> die

00:00:46.040 --> 00:00:46.050 
once it's installed you cut that die

00:00:46.050 --> 00:00:48.940 
once it's installed you cut that die
wrap<00:00:46.260> off<00:00:46.500> of<00:00:46.680> there<00:00:46.860> and<00:00:47.190> it<00:00:47.460> expands<00:00:48.300> out

00:00:48.940 --> 00:00:48.950 
wrap off of there and it expands out

00:00:48.950 --> 00:00:51.350 
wrap off of there and it expands out

00:02:19.179 --> 00:02:19.189 
also you got a check two radius arm the

00:02:19.189 --> 00:02:21.869 
also you got a check two radius arm the
end<00:02:19.400> of<00:02:19.579> it<00:02:19.700> here<00:02:19.969> that<00:02:20.120> it's<00:02:20.870> not<00:02:21.049> all<00:02:21.230> damaged

if<00:02:22.879> it<00:02:23.090> is<00:02:23.209> you<00:02:23.359> have<00:02:23.510> to<00:02:23.629> replace<00:02:23.900> the<00:02:24.109> radius

00:02:24.429 --> 00:02:24.439 
if it is you have to replace the radius

00:02:24.439 --> 00:02:28.059 
if it is you have to replace the radius
arm<00:02:25.000> to<00:02:26.000> do<00:02:26.150> that<00:02:26.439> you<00:02:27.439> have<00:02:27.650> to<00:02:27.769> take<00:02:27.920> that

00:02:28.059 --> 00:02:28.069 
arm to do that you have to take that

00:02:28.069 --> 00:02:30.270 
arm to do that you have to take that
spring<00:02:28.489> out<00:02:28.670> and<00:02:28.939> take<00:02:29.180> the<00:02:29.329> spring<00:02:29.629> out<00:02:29.780> I

00:02:30.270 --> 00:02:30.280 
spring out and take the spring out I

00:02:30.280 --> 00:02:33.250 
spring out and take the spring out I
would<00:02:31.280> go<00:02:31.430> I<00:02:31.459> don't<00:02:31.790> have<00:02:31.970> a<00:02:32.260> spring
