is<00:04:26.220> our<00:04:26.430> big<00:04:26.700> issue<00:04:27.030> in<00:04:27.120> mObridge<00:04:27.419> little<00:04:28.410> a

00:04:28.460 --> 00:04:28.470 
is our big issue in mObridge little a

00:04:28.470 --> 00:04:32.240 
is our big issue in mObridge little a
little<00:04:28.710> off<00:04:28.800> yuck<00:04:29.870> the<00:04:30.870> club<00:04:31.080> is<00:04:31.110> simply<00:04:31.950> for

00:04:32.240 --> 00:04:32.250 
little off yuck the club is simply for

00:04:32.250 --> 00:04:34.040 
little off yuck the club is simply for
40<00:04:32.550> years<00:04:32.700> was<00:04:32.970> small<00:04:33.330> it's<00:04:33.570> not<00:04:33.750> non-existent

00:04:34.040 --> 00:04:34.050 
40 years was small it's not non-existent

00:04:34.050 --> 00:04:37.490 
40 years was small it's not non-existent
so<00:04:34.860> the<00:04:35.700> next<00:04:35.729> step<00:04:35.970> for<00:04:36.270> us<00:04:36.330> would<00:04:36.570> be<00:04:36.630> who<00:04:37.020> try

00:04:37.490 --> 00:04:37.500 
so the next step for us would be who try

00:04:37.500 --> 00:04:40.760 
so the next step for us would be who try
and<00:04:38.240> Bobby<00:04:39.240> for<00:04:39.570> before<00:04:40.050> for<00:04:40.260> the<00:04:40.350> building<00:04:40.680> of

00:04:40.760 --> 00:04:40.770 
and Bobby for before for the building of

00:04:40.770 --> 00:04:42.469 
and Bobby for before for the building of
an<00:04:40.919> hour<00:04:41.070> around<00:04:41.220> stadium<00:04:41.760> which<00:04:42.150> is<00:04:42.270> a<00:04:42.300> very

00:04:42.469 --> 00:04:42.479 
an hour around stadium which is a very

00:04:42.479 --> 00:04:44.510 
an hour around stadium which is a very
very<00:04:42.900> important<00:04:43.410> for<00:04:43.560> the<00:04:43.680> club's<00:04:43.919> image<00:04:44.250> and

00:04:44.510 --> 00:04:44.520 
very important for the club's image and

00:04:44.520 --> 00:04:47.230 
very important for the club's image and
we<00:04:44.820> think<00:04:45.000> that<00:04:45.120> the<00:04:45.570> building<00:04:45.810> of<00:04:45.960> a<00:04:46.020> smaller

00:04:47.230 --> 00:04:47.240 
we think that the building of a smaller

00:04:47.240 --> 00:04:50.629 
we think that the building of a smaller
top<00:04:48.240> standard<00:04:48.750> stadium<00:04:49.200> would<00:04:49.740> bring<00:04:50.250> in<00:04:50.430> and

00:04:50.629 --> 00:04:50.639 
top standard stadium would bring in and

00:04:50.639 --> 00:04:53.690 
top standard stadium would bring in and
we'll<00:04:51.240> be<00:04:51.419> able<00:04:51.570> to<00:04:51.720> return<00:04:52.340> fans<00:04:53.340> which

00:04:53.690 --> 00:04:53.700
