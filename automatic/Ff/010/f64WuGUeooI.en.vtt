00:00:23.630 --> 00:00:23.640 
charger I'll let it sit for an hour and

00:00:23.640 --> 00:00:25.330 
charger I'll let it sit for an hour and
then<00:00:23.730> get<00:00:23.910> it<00:00:24.000> started<00:00:24.359> it's<00:00:24.510> still<00:00:24.750> six<00:00:24.960> volt

00:00:25.330 --> 00:00:25.340 
then get it started it's still six volt

00:00:25.340 --> 00:00:28.640 
then get it started it's still six volt
but<00:00:26.340> you<00:00:27.090> can<00:00:27.359> jump<00:00:27.599> six<00:00:27.840> volt<00:00:28.080> with<00:00:28.199> 12<00:00:28.439> volt

00:00:28.640 --> 00:00:28.650 
but you can jump six volt with 12 volt

00:00:28.650 --> 00:00:30.669 
but you can jump six volt with 12 volt
but<00:00:28.890> it's<00:00:29.039> not<00:00:29.220> real<00:00:29.369> good<00:00:29.550> for<00:00:29.730> either<00:00:29.849> one<00:00:30.119> I

00:01:03.560 --> 00:01:03.570 

00:01:03.570 --> 00:01:09.300 

and<00:01:04.020> that

00:01:22.649 --> 00:01:22.659 
what that is and involves that and

00:01:22.659 --> 00:01:25.109 
what that is and involves that and
that's<00:01:23.259> how<00:01:23.380> you<00:01:23.470> order<00:01:23.560> go<00:01:23.710> carts<00:01:24.100> so<00:01:24.970> we'll

00:01:25.109 --> 00:01:25.119 
that's how you order go carts so we'll

00:01:25.119 --> 00:01:27.840 
that's how you order go carts so we'll
leave<00:01:25.210> that<00:01:25.360> at<00:01:25.509> that<00:01:25.720> if<00:01:26.679> I<00:01:26.830> get<00:01:27.039> the<00:01:27.220> tractor

00:01:30.660 --> 00:01:30.670 
repaired here today maybe tomorrow we'll

00:01:30.670 --> 00:01:31.800 
repaired here today maybe tomorrow we'll
start<00:01:30.759> working<00:01:31.119> on<00:01:31.240> that<00:01:31.270> if<00:01:31.539> it's<00:01:31.689> not

raining<00:01:33.780> now<00:01:34.780> the<00:01:35.470> charging<00:01:35.920> system

00:01:36.480 --> 00:01:36.490 
raining now the charging system

00:01:36.490 --> 00:01:38.700 
raining now the charging system
like<00:01:37.060> I<00:01:37.179> said<00:01:37.240> this<00:01:37.570> is<00:01:37.750> still<00:01:37.929> six<00:01:38.200> volt<00:01:38.439> it

00:01:38.700 --> 00:01:38.710 
like I said this is still six volt it

00:01:38.710 --> 00:01:41.550 
like I said this is still six volt it
has<00:01:38.920> a<00:01:39.090> other<00:01:40.090> batteries<00:01:40.450> the<00:01:41.229> battery<00:01:41.500> is

00:01:41.550 --> 00:01:41.560 
has a other batteries the battery is

00:01:41.560 --> 00:01:42.960 
has a other batteries the battery is
probably<00:01:41.799> getting<00:01:42.009> down<00:01:42.190> the<00:01:42.340> vault<00:01:42.520> its<00:01:42.729> last

00:01:42.960 --> 00:01:42.970 
probably getting down the vault its last

00:01:42.970 --> 00:01:46.350 
probably getting down the vault its last
legs<00:01:43.289> but<00:01:44.289> it<00:01:44.380> still<00:01:44.560> holds<00:01:44.799> a<00:01:44.860> charge<00:01:45.360> the

00:01:46.350 --> 00:01:46.360 
legs but it still holds a charge the

00:01:46.360 --> 00:01:50.190 
legs but it still holds a charge the
original<00:01:46.750> generator<00:01:47.200> on<00:01:47.380> these<00:01:47.590> things<00:01:47.890> is<00:01:49.200> an

00:01:50.190 --> 00:01:50.200 
original generator on these things is an

00:01:50.200 --> 00:01:56.070 
original generator on these things is an
11<00:01:50.770> amp<00:01:51.039> generator<00:01:52.229> now<00:01:53.640> 11<00:01:54.640> amps<00:01:54.849> is<00:01:55.390> about

00:01:56.070 --> 00:01:56.080 
11 amp generator now 11 amps is about

00:01:56.080 --> 00:01:57.749 
11 amp generator now 11 amps is about
just<00:01:56.319> enough<00:01:56.500> to<00:01:56.649> charge<00:01:56.860> a<00:01:56.950> battery<00:01:56.979> in<00:01:57.520> fact

00:01:57.749 --> 00:01:57.759 
just enough to charge a battery in fact

00:02:12.120 --> 00:02:12.130 
on it you turn on the original 6 volt

00:02:12.130 --> 00:02:14.099 
on it you turn on the original 6 volt
headlights<00:02:12.519> and<00:02:13.000> it<00:02:13.239> would<00:02:13.390> discharge<00:02:13.720> the

00:02:14.099 --> 00:02:14.109 
headlights and it would discharge the

00:02:14.109 --> 00:02:16.740 
headlights and it would discharge the
battery<00:02:14.140> even<00:02:14.859> a<00:02:15.070> wide-open<00:02:15.280> throttle<00:02:15.730> I<00:02:16.090> love

00:02:16.740 --> 00:02:16.750 
battery even a wide-open throttle I love

00:02:16.750 --> 00:02:22.319 
battery even a wide-open throttle I love
an<00:02:16.870> abscess<00:02:17.200> not<00:02:17.410> very<00:02:17.620> much<00:02:18.660> so<00:02:21.180> we've<00:02:22.180> all

00:02:22.319 --> 00:02:22.329 
an abscess not very much so we've all

00:02:22.329 --> 00:02:23.780 
an abscess not very much so we've all
seen<00:02:22.600> the<00:02:22.750> old<00:02:22.900> Ford

00:02:23.780 --> 00:02:23.790 
seen the old Ford

00:02:23.790 --> 00:02:27.780 
seen the old Ford
it's<00:02:24.790> a<00:02:24.880> 1954<00:02:25.890> mainline<00:02:26.890> which<00:02:27.609> was

00:02:27.780 --> 00:02:27.790 
it's a 1954 mainline which was

00:02:27.790 --> 00:02:28.890 
it's a 1954 mainline which was
originally<00:02:28.000> 6<00:02:28.510> volt

00:02:28.890 --> 00:02:28.900 
originally 6 volt

00:02:28.900 --> 00:02:30.930 
originally 6 volt
I<00:02:28.959> changed<00:02:29.350> the<00:02:29.440> engine<00:02:29.709> in<00:02:29.829> that<00:02:29.859> the<00:02:30.609> engine

00:02:30.930 --> 00:02:30.940 
I changed the engine in that the engine

00:02:30.940 --> 00:02:34.380 
I changed the engine in that the engine
was<00:02:31.090> a<00:02:31.299> few<00:02:31.660> years<00:02:31.900> newer<00:02:32.109> and<00:02:32.440> his<00:02:32.769> 12-volt<00:02:33.390> so

00:02:34.380 --> 00:02:34.390 
was a few years newer and his 12-volt so

00:02:34.390 --> 00:02:35.789 
was a few years newer and his 12-volt so
took<00:02:34.450> the<00:02:34.660> original<00:02:34.750> generator<00:02:35.410> from<00:02:35.590> that

00:02:35.789 --> 00:02:35.799 
took the original generator from that

00:02:35.799 --> 00:02:39.960 
took the original generator from that
Ford<00:02:36.150> which<00:02:37.150> is<00:02:37.299> a<00:02:37.329> 25<00:02:37.810> amp<00:02:38.019> generator<00:02:38.970> and

00:02:39.960 --> 00:02:39.970 
Ford which is a 25 amp generator and

00:02:39.970 --> 00:02:43.229 
Ford which is a 25 amp generator and
it's<00:02:40.180> now<00:02:40.359> mounted<00:02:40.840> right<00:02:41.590> there<00:02:42.060> it<00:02:43.060> has<00:02:43.209> a

00:02:43.229 --> 00:02:43.239 
it's now mounted right there it has a

00:02:43.239 --> 00:02:45.900 
it's now mounted right there it has a
new<00:02:43.480> voltage<00:02:43.750> regulator<00:02:44.380> which<00:02:45.370> I<00:02:45.609> don't<00:02:45.850> know

can see it it's up inside here that's a

00:02:51.430 --> 00:02:53.640 
can see it it's up inside here that's a
real<00:02:51.609> bear<00:02:51.819> to<00:02:51.940> get<00:02:52.060> to<00:02:52.239> oh<00:02:52.450> you<00:02:53.260> might<00:02:53.440> be<00:02:53.560> able

00:02:53.640 --> 00:02:53.650 
real bear to get to oh you might be able

that's<00:03:09.120> new<00:03:09.360> uh<00:03:10.250> when<00:03:11.250> I<00:03:11.280> did<00:03:11.550> the<00:03:11.640> conversion

00:03:12.160 --> 00:03:12.170 
that's new uh when I did the conversion

00:03:12.170 --> 00:03:15.050 
that's new uh when I did the conversion
sorry<00:03:13.170> about<00:03:13.350> that<00:03:13.380> I<00:03:13.560> lost<00:03:13.860> my<00:03:14.010> battery<00:03:14.310> well

screw on the back of the generator which

00:03:27.510 --> 00:03:28.790 
screw on the back of the generator which
you<00:03:27.600> adjusted<00:03:28.050> back<00:03:28.200> and<00:03:28.380> forth<00:03:28.560> and<00:03:28.680> there

00:03:28.790 --> 00:03:28.800 
you adjusted back and forth and there

00:03:28.800 --> 00:03:30.830 
you adjusted back and forth and there
was<00:03:28.890> a<00:03:28.920> third<00:03:29.190> brush<00:03:29.490> and<00:03:29.790> it<00:03:30.480> turned<00:03:30.720> that

was a third brush and it turned that

00:03:30.840 --> 00:03:33.530 
was a third brush and it turned that
third<00:03:31.170> brush<00:03:31.610> to<00:03:32.610> regulate<00:03:33.030> your<00:03:33.150> current

three<00:03:38.730> coil<00:03:38.970> voltage<00:03:39.300> regulator<00:03:39.690> you<00:03:39.810> got

00:03:39.980 --> 00:03:39.990 
three coil voltage regulator you got

00:03:39.990 --> 00:03:41.930 
three coil voltage regulator you got
your<00:03:40.200> armature<00:03:40.920> lead<00:03:41.160> your<00:03:41.370> field<00:03:41.580> lead<00:03:41.790> this

00:03:41.930 --> 00:03:41.940 
your armature lead your field lead this

00:03:41.940 --> 00:03:45.500 
your armature lead your field lead this
one<00:03:42.090> is<00:03:42.210> ground<00:03:42.480> I<00:03:43.520> think<00:03:44.520> what<00:03:44.940> happened<00:03:45.390> is

00:03:45.500 --> 00:03:45.510 
one is ground I think what happened is

00:03:45.510 --> 00:03:48.470 
one is ground I think what happened is
because<00:03:45.900> of<00:03:46.020> this<00:03:46.110> loader<00:03:46.410> on<00:03:46.650> here<00:03:47.420> this<00:03:48.420> is

00:03:48.470 --> 00:03:48.480 
because of this loader on here this is

00:03:48.480 --> 00:03:52.100 
because of this loader on here this is
the<00:03:48.720> hot<00:03:48.870> terminal<00:03:49.430> and<00:03:50.430> I<00:03:50.520> think<00:03:50.870> that<00:03:51.870> the

00:03:52.100 --> 00:03:52.110 
the hot terminal and I think that the

00:03:52.110 --> 00:03:54.050 
the hot terminal and I think that the
loader<00:03:52.290> bounces<00:03:52.740> around<00:03:52.860> and<00:03:53.250> hits<00:03:53.520> that<00:03:53.730> hot

00:03:54.050 --> 00:03:54.060 
loader bounces around and hits that hot

00:03:54.060 --> 00:03:55.340 
loader bounces around and hits that hot
terminal<00:03:54.480> because<00:03:54.600> I<00:03:54.870> know<00:03:54.930> I've<00:03:55.110> seen<00:03:55.260> the

00:03:55.340 --> 00:03:55.350 
terminal because I know I've seen the

00:03:55.350 --> 00:03:57.530 
terminal because I know I've seen the
sparks<00:03:55.530> come<00:03:55.800> out<00:03:55.920> of<00:03:56.010> there<00:03:56.150> so<00:03:57.150> I'm<00:03:57.270> hoping

00:03:57.530 --> 00:03:57.540 
sparks come out of there so I'm hoping

00:03:57.540 --> 00:04:01.730 
sparks come out of there so I'm hoping
that<00:03:57.600> I<00:03:57.750> didn't<00:03:57.990> kill<00:03:58.110> the<00:03:58.260> generator<00:03:58.940> but<00:04:00.740> we

00:04:01.730 --> 00:04:01.740 
that I didn't kill the generator but we

00:04:01.740 --> 00:04:05.900 
that I didn't kill the generator but we
will<00:04:02.540> get<00:04:03.540> things<00:04:03.780> around<00:04:04.380> here<00:04:04.740> and<00:04:04.980> probably

00:04:05.900 --> 00:04:05.910 
will get things around here and probably

00:04:05.910 --> 00:04:08.630 
will get things around here and probably
pull<00:04:06.210> the<00:04:06.300> regulator<00:04:06.720> out<00:04:06.900> of<00:04:07.140> there<00:04:07.440> so<00:04:08.400> I<00:04:08.460> can

00:04:08.630 --> 00:04:08.640 
pull the regulator out of there so I can

00:04:08.640 --> 00:04:10.720 
pull the regulator out of there so I can
see<00:04:08.790> what's<00:04:08.940> going<00:04:09.210> on<00:04:09.330> with<00:04:09.510> that<00:04:09.690> and

00:04:10.720 --> 00:04:10.730 
see what's going on with that and

00:04:10.730 --> 00:04:12.860 
see what's going on with that and
Tesla's<00:04:11.730> system<00:04:11.910> I'll<00:04:12.210> see<00:04:12.360> if<00:04:12.510> I<00:04:12.600> can<00:04:12.690> get<00:04:12.810> her

00:04:12.860 --> 00:04:12.870 
Tesla's system I'll see if I can get her

00:04:12.870 --> 00:04:22.970 
Tesla's system I'll see if I can get her
to<00:04:12.900> charge

00:04:22.970 --> 00:04:22.980 

00:04:22.980 --> 00:04:56.960 

I<00:04:24.770> misspoke<00:04:25.770> earlier<00:04:27.020> the<00:04:28.020> armature

00:04:56.960 --> 00:04:56.970 

00:04:56.970 --> 00:05:03.140 

wire<00:04:57.970> coming<00:04:58.330> from<00:04:58.450> the<00:04:58.630> regulator

00:05:03.140 --> 00:05:03.150 

00:05:03.150 --> 00:05:22.230 

so<00:05:03.630> it's<00:05:03.780> latched<00:05:04.020> itself

00:05:22.230 --> 00:05:22.240 

00:05:22.240 --> 00:05:25.590 

I<00:05:22.300> think<00:05:23.080> the<00:05:23.199> voltage

00:05:25.590 --> 00:05:25.600 
I think the voltage

00:05:25.600 --> 00:05:30.690 
I think the voltage
I<00:05:27.600> think<00:05:28.600> the<00:05:28.720> voltage<00:05:29.140> is<00:05:29.320> just<00:05:29.590> low<00:05:29.830> it's

00:05:30.690 --> 00:05:30.700 
I think the voltage is just low it's

00:05:30.700 --> 00:05:33.090 
I think the voltage is just low it's
only<00:05:30.730> putting<00:05:31.030> out<00:05:31.150> about<00:05:31.270> seven<00:05:31.780> volts<00:05:32.200> so

00:05:33.090 --> 00:05:33.100 
only putting out about seven volts so

00:05:33.100 --> 00:05:35.340 
only putting out about seven volts so
I'm<00:05:33.460> going<00:05:33.760> to<00:05:33.910> try<00:05:34.600> to<00:05:34.630> pull<00:05:34.870> the<00:05:34.990> regulator

00:05:35.340 --> 00:05:35.350 
I'm going to try to pull the regulator

00:05:35.350 --> 00:05:37.350 
I'm going to try to pull the regulator
out<00:05:35.560> of<00:05:35.680> there<00:05:35.830> and<00:05:36.220> adjust<00:05:36.790> that<00:05:36.940> up<00:05:37.000> a<00:05:37.240> little

00:05:37.350 --> 00:05:37.360 
out of there and adjust that up a little

00:05:37.360 --> 00:05:42.020 
out of there and adjust that up a little
bit<00:05:37.510> a<00:05:37.900> little<00:05:38.770> bit<00:05:38.890> more<00:05:38.980> voltage<00:05:39.310> out<00:05:39.670> of<00:05:39.790> it

00:05:42.020 --> 00:05:42.030 

00:05:42.030 --> 00:05:43.950 

because<00:05:43.030> the<00:05:43.150> generator<00:05:43.480> should<00:05:43.660> put<00:05:43.840> out

00:05:43.950 --> 00:05:43.960 
because the generator should put out

00:05:43.960 --> 00:05:49.980 
because the generator should put out
more<00:05:44.140> than<00:05:44.290> that<00:05:44.500> and<00:05:48.240> that<00:05:49.240> way<00:05:49.390> it'll<00:05:49.570> it'll

00:05:49.980 --> 00:05:49.990 
more than that and that way it'll it'll

00:05:49.990 --> 00:05:51.180 
more than that and that way it'll it'll
charge<00:05:50.230> the<00:05:50.470> battery<00:05:50.740> a<00:05:50.770> little<00:05:51.070> better

00:05:51.180 --> 00:05:51.190 
charge the battery a little better

00:05:51.190 --> 00:05:54.390 
charge the battery a little better
because<00:05:52.120> the<00:05:52.360> tractor<00:05:52.660> doesn't<00:05:52.890> the<00:05:53.890> idea<00:05:54.160> was

00:05:54.390 --> 00:05:54.400 
because the tractor doesn't the idea was

00:05:54.400 --> 00:05:56.430 
because the tractor doesn't the idea was
with<00:05:55.090> the<00:05:55.240> lower<00:05:55.420> current<00:05:55.840> is<00:05:55.960> because<00:05:56.260> it's

00:05:56.430 --> 00:05:56.440 
with the lower current is because it's

00:05:56.440 --> 00:05:57.810 
with the lower current is because it's
meant<00:05:56.620> to<00:05:56.710> be<00:05:56.830> in<00:05:56.950> a<00:05:57.010> field<00:05:57.250> all<00:05:57.460> day<00:05:57.490> long

00:05:57.810 --> 00:05:57.820 
meant to be in a field all day long

00:05:57.820 --> 00:06:00.360 
meant to be in a field all day long
around<00:05:58.180> eight<00:05:58.300> hours<00:05:58.570> a<00:05:58.600> day<00:05:58.920> and<00:05:59.920> you<00:06:00.040> you'd

00:06:00.360 --> 00:06:00.370 
around eight hours a day and you you'd

00:06:00.370 --> 00:06:01.950 
around eight hours a day and you you'd
boil<00:06:00.610> a<00:06:00.730> battery<00:06:01.060> back<00:06:01.240> in<00:06:01.270> the<00:06:01.450> old<00:06:01.600> days<00:06:01.780> if

00:06:01.950 --> 00:06:01.960 
boil a battery back in the old days if

00:06:01.960 --> 00:06:04.530 
boil a battery back in the old days if
you<00:06:02.050> were<00:06:02.110> putting<00:06:02.320> out<00:06:02.440> too<00:06:02.620> much<00:06:02.800> so<00:06:03.540> they

00:06:04.530 --> 00:06:04.540 
you were putting out too much so they

00:06:04.540 --> 00:06:05.850 
you were putting out too much so they
were<00:06:04.600> meant<00:06:04.840> to<00:06:04.900> not<00:06:05.140> put<00:06:05.440> out<00:06:05.560> a<00:06:05.590> lot<00:06:05.740> of

00:06:05.850 --> 00:06:05.860 
were meant to not put out a lot of

00:06:05.860 --> 00:06:07.410 
were meant to not put out a lot of
charging<00:06:06.220> current<00:06:06.550> but<00:06:06.670> this<00:06:06.820> thing<00:06:07.060> you<00:06:07.390> know

00:06:07.410 --> 00:06:07.420 
charging current but this thing you know

00:06:07.420 --> 00:06:09.180 
charging current but this thing you know
I<00:06:07.510> might<00:06:07.780> start<00:06:08.050> it<00:06:08.140> up<00:06:08.200> and<00:06:08.320> maybe<00:06:08.530> run<00:06:08.830> it<00:06:08.950> for

00:06:09.180 --> 00:06:09.190 
I might start it up and maybe run it for

00:06:09.190 --> 00:06:11.370 
I might start it up and maybe run it for
you<00:06:09.940> know<00:06:10.060> an<00:06:10.240> hour<00:06:10.420> and<00:06:10.690> plow<00:06:10.810> the<00:06:10.840> driveway

00:06:11.370 --> 00:06:11.380 
you know an hour and plow the driveway

00:06:11.380 --> 00:06:14.550 
you know an hour and plow the driveway
well<00:06:12.220> if<00:06:12.910> it's<00:06:13.120> only<00:06:13.300> putting<00:06:13.540> out<00:06:13.720> 1012<00:06:14.260> amps

00:06:14.550 --> 00:06:14.560 
well if it's only putting out 1012 amps

00:06:14.560 --> 00:06:15.720 
well if it's only putting out 1012 amps
it's<00:06:14.680> just<00:06:14.920> gonna<00:06:15.040> barely<00:06:15.310> charge<00:06:15.610> the

00:06:15.720 --> 00:06:15.730 
it's just gonna barely charge the

00:06:15.730 --> 00:06:17.730 
it's just gonna barely charge the
battery<00:06:16.000> in<00:06:16.090> an<00:06:16.150> hour<00:06:16.300> so<00:06:17.200> I'm<00:06:17.260> gonna<00:06:17.380> see<00:06:17.560> if<00:06:17.650> I

00:06:17.730 --> 00:06:17.740 
battery in an hour so I'm gonna see if I

00:06:17.740 --> 00:06:20.190 
battery in an hour so I'm gonna see if I
can<00:06:17.920> boost<00:06:18.100> that<00:06:18.310> voltage<00:06:18.550> up<00:06:18.850> just<00:06:19.840> a<00:06:19.930> little

00:06:20.190 --> 00:06:20.200 
can boost that voltage up just a little

00:06:20.200 --> 00:06:24.600 
can boost that voltage up just a little
bit<00:06:20.350> and<00:06:22.710> that<00:06:23.710> way<00:06:23.890> she'll<00:06:24.100> charge<00:06:24.340> a<00:06:24.520> little

00:06:24.600 --> 00:06:24.610 
bit and that way she'll charge a little

00:06:24.610 --> 00:06:26.370 
bit and that way she'll charge a little
better<00:06:24.880> so<00:06:25.390> apparently<00:06:25.750> it's<00:06:25.900> just<00:06:26.080> the<00:06:26.200> gauge

00:06:26.370 --> 00:06:26.380 
better so apparently it's just the gauge

00:06:26.380 --> 00:06:28.740 
better so apparently it's just the gauge
that's<00:06:26.620> not<00:06:26.770> working<00:06:27.190> which<00:06:28.150> is<00:06:28.300> a<00:06:28.330> good<00:06:28.540> thing

00:06:28.740 --> 00:06:28.750 
that's not working which is a good thing

00:06:28.750 --> 00:06:32.520 
that's not working which is a good thing
but<00:06:29.970> still<00:06:30.970> a<00:06:31.030> job<00:06:31.270> anyway<00:06:31.660> so<00:06:31.930> I'll<00:06:32.200> check

00:06:32.520 --> 00:06:32.530 
but still a job anyway so I'll check

00:06:32.530 --> 00:06:52.510 
but still a job anyway so I'll check
back<00:06:32.650> in<00:06:32.710> a<00:06:32.890> minute

00:06:52.510 --> 00:06:52.520 

00:06:52.520 --> 00:06:55.330 

now<00:06:53.060> if<00:06:53.180> I<00:06:53.330> take<00:06:53.569> in<00:06:53.930> short<00:06:54.289> the<00:06:54.470> field<00:06:54.770> to<00:06:55.310> the

00:06:55.330 --> 00:06:55.340 
now if I take in short the field to the

00:06:55.340 --> 00:06:56.730 
now if I take in short the field to the
armature

00:06:56.730 --> 00:06:56.740 
armature

00:06:56.740 --> 00:07:16.990 
armature
that'll<00:06:57.310> give<00:06:57.490> it<00:06:57.520> full<00:06:57.910> charge

00:07:16.990 --> 00:07:17.000 

00:07:17.000 --> 00:07:18.610 

that<00:07:17.330> went<00:07:17.510> right<00:07:17.660> up<00:07:17.840> to<00:07:17.870> like<00:07:18.140> eight<00:07:18.440> and<00:07:18.590> a

00:07:18.610 --> 00:07:18.620 
that went right up to like eight and a

00:07:18.620 --> 00:07:20.110 
that went right up to like eight and a
half<00:07:18.650> volts<00:07:19.010> and<00:07:19.250> you<00:07:19.310> heard<00:07:19.490> the<00:07:19.610> engine<00:07:19.940> look

00:07:20.110 --> 00:07:20.120 
half volts and you heard the engine look

00:07:20.120 --> 00:07:23.320 
half volts and you heard the engine look
down<00:07:20.330> a<00:07:20.360> little<00:07:20.510> bit<00:07:20.840> I<00:07:21.200> was<00:07:21.950> watching<00:07:22.430> the<00:07:22.550> amp

00:07:23.320 --> 00:07:23.330 
down a little bit I was watching the amp

00:07:23.330 --> 00:07:26.320 
down a little bit I was watching the amp
gauge<00:07:23.600> the<00:07:24.260> FH<00:07:24.590> goes<00:07:24.860> right<00:07:25.100> up<00:07:25.310> so<00:07:26.150> let's

00:07:26.320 --> 00:07:26.330 
gauge the FH goes right up so let's

00:07:26.330 --> 00:07:28.460 
gauge the FH goes right up so let's
charge

00:07:28.460 --> 00:07:28.470 
charge

00:07:28.470 --> 00:07:30.770 
charge
just<00:07:28.770> not<00:07:28.950> charging<00:07:29.370> enough

00:07:30.770 --> 00:07:30.780 
just not charging enough

00:07:30.780 --> 00:07:33.610 
just not charging enough
do<00:07:30.870> some<00:07:31.080> adjusting<00:07:31.530> on<00:07:31.680> the<00:07:31.710> regulator

00:07:33.610 --> 00:07:33.620 
do some adjusting on the regulator

00:07:33.620 --> 00:07:35.560 
do some adjusting on the regulator
we're<00:07:34.310> gonna<00:07:34.430> give<00:07:34.669> it<00:07:34.700> a<00:07:34.820> shot<00:07:35.060> and<00:07:35.090> see<00:07:35.540> how

00:07:35.560 --> 00:07:35.570 
we're gonna give it a shot and see how

00:07:35.570 --> 00:07:39.010 
we're gonna give it a shot and see how
it<00:07:36.160> how<00:07:37.160> it<00:07:37.190> works<00:07:37.520> this<00:07:37.730> winter

00:07:39.010 --> 00:07:39.020 
it how it works this winter

00:07:39.020 --> 00:07:40.600 
it how it works this winter
so<00:07:39.229> I'm<00:07:39.319> gonna<00:07:39.470> button<00:07:39.740> her<00:07:39.860> back<00:07:40.039> up<00:07:40.280> and<00:07:40.460> call

00:07:40.600 --> 00:07:40.610 
so I'm gonna button her back up and call

00:07:40.610 --> 00:07:43.930
