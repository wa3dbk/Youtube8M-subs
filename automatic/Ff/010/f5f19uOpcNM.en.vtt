00:01:40.420 --> 00:01:40.430 
city is just a 20 megahertz extra on the

00:01:40.430 --> 00:01:45.100 
city is just a 20 megahertz extra on the
GPU<00:01:41.430> and<00:01:41.850> on<00:01:42.630> the<00:01:42.720> memory<00:01:42.899> clock<00:01:43.229> an<00:01:43.829> extra<00:01:44.310> 25

00:01:45.100 --> 00:01:45.110 
GPU and on the memory clock an extra 25

00:01:45.110 --> 00:01:47.149 
GPU and on the memory clock an extra 25
yes<00:01:46.110> i'll<00:01:46.229> be<00:01:46.350> back<00:01:46.470> with<00:01:46.680> the<00:01:46.710> results<00:01:46.799> of<00:01:47.070> the

00:01:53.300 --> 00:01:53.310 
how do you get that many more pc marks

00:01:53.310 --> 00:01:56.630 
how do you get that many more pc marks
but<00:01:53.579> of<00:01:53.790> a<00:01:53.970> few<00:01:54.240> so<00:01:55.110> yeah<00:01:55.290> i'm<00:01:56.219> going<00:01:56.369> to<00:01:56.430> try<00:01:56.549> it

00:01:56.630 --> 00:01:56.640 
but of a few so yeah i'm going to try it

00:01:56.640 --> 00:01:59.300 
but of a few so yeah i'm going to try it
now<00:01:56.939> with<00:01:57.479> a<00:01:57.509> max<00:01:57.930> tell<00:01:58.200> overclock<00:01:58.770> and<00:01:59.100> see

00:01:59.300 --> 00:01:59.310 
now with a max tell overclock and see

00:01:59.310 --> 00:02:04.219 
now with a max tell overclock and see
what<00:01:59.399> happens<00:02:00.649> ok<00:02:01.649> so<00:02:02.240> before<00:02:03.240> she's<00:02:03.659> marking

00:02:04.219 --> 00:02:04.229 
what happens ok so before she's marking

00:02:04.229 --> 00:02:07.880 
what happens ok so before she's marking
if<00:02:04.619> we<00:02:04.770> go<00:02:04.950> down<00:02:04.979> to<00:02:05.600> afterburner<00:02:06.600> i<00:02:06.869> could<00:02:07.710> not

00:02:07.880 --> 00:02:07.890 
if we go down to afterburner i could not

00:02:07.890 --> 00:02:09.680 
if we go down to afterburner i could not
get<00:02:08.069> it<00:02:08.160> max<00:02:08.369> dale<00:02:08.610> because<00:02:08.879> it<00:02:08.970> kept<00:02:09.149> crashing

00:02:09.680 --> 00:02:09.690 
get it max dale because it kept crashing

00:02:09.690 --> 00:02:11.330 
get it max dale because it kept crashing
so<00:02:09.959> i<00:02:09.989> got<00:02:10.289> it<00:02:10.319> as<00:02:10.500> high<00:02:10.649> as<00:02:10.709> I<00:02:10.860> could<00:02:11.039> without<00:02:11.160> a

00:02:11.330 --> 00:02:11.340 
so i got it as high as I could without a

00:02:11.340 --> 00:02:12.660 
so i got it as high as I could without a
crash<00:02:11.670> in<00:02:11.879> cycle

00:02:12.660 --> 00:02:12.670 
crash in cycle

00:02:12.670 --> 00:02:18.449 
crash in cycle
35<00:02:13.000> and<00:02:13.140> 1425<00:02:14.700> make<00:02:15.700> notes<00:02:15.910> on<00:02:16.090> each<00:02:16.150> and<00:02:17.459> let

00:02:18.449 --> 00:02:18.459 
35 and 1425 make notes on each and let

00:02:18.459 --> 00:02:21.270 
35 and 1425 make notes on each and let
me<00:02:18.520> show<00:02:18.670> you<00:02:18.730> the<00:02:18.880> school<00:02:19.770> when<00:02:20.770> you<00:02:20.890> overcook
