00:00:37.220 --> 00:00:37.230 
offset which is your basic offset you

00:00:37.230 --> 00:00:39.170 
offset which is your basic offset you
can<00:00:37.440> set<00:00:38.070> the<00:00:38.190> calculator<00:00:38.730> to<00:00:38.790> work<00:00:38.820> with

00:00:39.170 --> 00:00:39.180 
can set the calculator to work with

00:00:39.180 --> 00:00:42.080 
can set the calculator to work with
45-degree<00:00:39.960> fittings<00:00:40.350> or<00:00:40.770> you<00:00:41.309> can<00:00:41.460> use<00:00:41.670> custom

00:00:42.080 --> 00:00:42.090 
45-degree fittings or you can use custom

00:00:42.090 --> 00:00:44.930 
45-degree fittings or you can use custom
fittings<00:00:42.420> if<00:00:42.540> you<00:00:42.660> need<00:00:42.809> to<00:00:43.520> the<00:00:44.520> one<00:00:44.670> on<00:00:44.700> the

00:00:44.930 --> 00:00:44.940 
fittings if you need to the one on the

00:00:44.940 --> 00:00:47.630 
fittings if you need to the one on the
right<00:00:45.120> is<00:00:45.930> a<00:00:46.079> rolling<00:00:46.410> offset<00:00:47.100> using

00:00:47.630 --> 00:00:47.640 
right is a rolling offset using

right is a rolling offset using
45-degree<00:00:48.539> fittings<00:00:49.850> we<00:00:50.850> scroll<00:00:51.120> down<00:00:51.360> on<00:00:52.260> the

00:00:53.240 --> 00:00:53.250 
45-degree fittings we scroll down on the

00:00:53.250 --> 00:00:54.830 
45-degree fittings we scroll down on the
next<00:00:53.430> row<00:00:53.670> on<00:00:53.850> the<00:00:53.969> left<00:00:54.000> you've<00:00:54.420> got<00:00:54.449> rolling

00:00:54.830 --> 00:00:54.840 
next row on the left you've got rolling

00:00:54.840 --> 00:00:58.130 
next row on the left you've got rolling
offset<00:00:55.440> odd<00:00:55.800> angle<00:00:56.449> that<00:00:57.449> essentially<00:00:57.930> will

00:00:58.130 --> 00:00:58.140 
offset odd angle that essentially will

00:00:58.140 --> 00:01:01.459 
offset odd angle that essentially will
allow<00:00:58.289> you<00:00:58.350> to<00:00:58.910> create<00:00:59.910> an<00:01:00.059> offset<00:01:00.480> in<00:01:00.719> a<00:01:01.079> given

00:01:01.459 --> 00:01:01.469 
allow you to create an offset in a given

00:01:01.469 --> 00:01:03.410 
allow you to create an offset in a given
dimension<00:01:01.920> where<00:01:02.160> the<00:01:02.190> 45-degree<00:01:03.090> fittings

00:01:03.410 --> 00:01:03.420 
dimension where the 45-degree fittings

00:01:03.420 --> 00:01:04.759 
dimension where the 45-degree fittings
may<00:01:03.570> not<00:01:03.750> work<00:01:03.960> and<00:01:04.229> you<00:01:04.350> need<00:01:04.500> to<00:01:04.589> use<00:01:04.739> a

00:01:04.759 --> 00:01:04.769 
may not work and you need to use a

00:01:04.769 --> 00:01:07.730 
may not work and you need to use a
custom<00:01:05.070> angle<00:01:06.020> and<00:01:07.020> the<00:01:07.200> middle<00:01:07.439> you've<00:01:07.619> got<00:01:07.710> a

00:01:07.730 --> 00:01:07.740 
custom angle and the middle you've got a

00:01:07.740 --> 00:01:09.920 
custom angle and the middle you've got a
rolling<00:01:07.979> offset<00:01:08.520> where<00:01:09.090> the<00:01:09.180> pipe<00:01:09.390> exits<00:01:09.810> to

00:01:09.920 --> 00:01:09.930 
rolling offset where the pipe exits to

00:01:09.930 --> 00:01:12.830 
rolling offset where the pipe exits to
the<00:01:10.049> left<00:01:10.549> it's<00:01:11.549> more<00:01:11.760> of<00:01:11.820> an<00:01:11.909> advanced<00:01:12.390> offset

00:01:12.830 --> 00:01:12.840 
the left it's more of an advanced offset

00:01:12.840 --> 00:01:16.100 
the left it's more of an advanced offset
in<00:01:13.560> the<00:01:13.710> calculator<00:01:14.220> you<00:01:14.280> actually<00:01:14.760> can<00:01:15.110> swap

00:01:16.100 --> 00:01:16.110 
in the calculator you actually can swap

00:01:16.110 --> 00:01:18.679 
in the calculator you actually can swap
it<00:01:16.140> to<00:01:16.380> exit<00:01:16.740> right<00:01:16.979> instead<00:01:17.939> of<00:01:18.000> the<00:01:18.119> left<00:01:18.180> so

00:01:18.679 --> 00:01:18.689 
it to exit right instead of the left so

00:01:18.689 --> 00:01:22.880 
it to exit right instead of the left so
it's<00:01:19.650> kind<00:01:19.890> of<00:01:19.950> a<00:01:20.040> universal<00:01:20.659> calculator<00:01:21.890> the

00:01:22.880 --> 00:01:22.890 
it's kind of a universal calculator the

00:01:22.890 --> 00:01:24.530 
it's kind of a universal calculator the
rolling<00:01:23.189> offset<00:01:23.549> vertical<00:01:24.000> where<00:01:24.240> the<00:01:24.330> pipe

00:01:24.530 --> 00:01:24.540 
rolling offset vertical where the pipe

00:01:24.540 --> 00:01:29.240 
rolling offset vertical where the pipe
exits<00:01:24.990> vertical<00:01:26.119> then<00:01:27.119> we<00:01:27.240> have<00:01:27.650> an<00:01:28.650> equal

00:01:29.240 --> 00:01:29.250 
exits vertical then we have an equal

00:01:29.250 --> 00:01:31.609 
exits vertical then we have an equal
spread<00:01:29.490> offset<00:01:29.939> it<00:01:30.689> does<00:01:30.900> up<00:01:31.020> to<00:01:31.140> four<00:01:31.350> lines

00:01:31.609 --> 00:01:31.619 
spread offset it does up to four lines

00:01:31.619 --> 00:01:33.710 
spread offset it does up to four lines
you<00:01:32.280> can<00:01:32.430> choose<00:01:32.670> any<00:01:32.880> size<00:01:33.119> pipe<00:01:33.390> for<00:01:33.659> each

00:01:33.710 --> 00:01:33.720 
you can choose any size pipe for each

00:01:33.720 --> 00:01:35.870 
you can choose any size pipe for each
line<00:01:33.990> you<00:01:34.290> can<00:01:34.979> set<00:01:35.189> the<00:01:35.310> distance<00:01:35.490> between

00:01:35.870 --> 00:01:35.880 
line you can set the distance between

00:01:35.880 --> 00:01:39.080 
line you can set the distance between
each<00:01:36.150> line<00:01:36.570> and<00:01:36.930> as<00:01:37.350> well<00:01:37.530> as<00:01:38.090> utilize

00:01:39.080 --> 00:01:39.090 
each line and as well as utilize

00:01:39.090 --> 00:01:42.380 
each line and as well as utilize
insulation<00:01:40.579> it'll<00:01:41.579> also<00:01:41.729> let<00:01:41.909> you<00:01:42.180> know<00:01:42.210> if

00:01:42.380 --> 00:01:42.390 
insulation it'll also let you know if

00:01:42.390 --> 00:01:44.539 
insulation it'll also let you know if
there's<00:01:42.570> any<00:01:42.720> engineering<00:01:43.200> conflicts<00:01:43.740> if<00:01:44.340> any

00:01:44.539 --> 00:01:44.549 
there's any engineering conflicts if any

00:01:44.549 --> 00:01:46.550 
there's any engineering conflicts if any
of<00:01:44.670> the<00:01:44.759> pipes<00:01:44.939> are<00:01:45.090> going<00:01:45.240> to<00:01:45.299> touch<00:01:45.479> based<00:01:46.380> on

00:01:46.550 --> 00:01:46.560 
of the pipes are going to touch based on

00:01:46.560 --> 00:01:49.580 
of the pipes are going to touch based on
the<00:01:46.649> dimensions<00:01:46.950> you<00:01:47.280> provide<00:01:48.439> then<00:01:49.439> you've

00:01:49.580 --> 00:01:49.590 
the dimensions you provide then you've

00:01:49.590 --> 00:01:52.310 
the dimensions you provide then you've
got<00:01:49.740> the<00:01:49.890> rolling<00:01:50.220> offset<00:01:50.729> using<00:01:51.689> a<00:01:51.750> 90<00:01:52.049> degree

00:01:52.310 --> 00:01:52.320 
got the rolling offset using a 90 degree

00:01:52.320 --> 00:01:55.100 
got the rolling offset using a 90 degree
fitting<00:01:52.610> you<00:01:53.610> also<00:01:53.790> can<00:01:54.060> use<00:01:54.210> a<00:01:54.240> 45<00:01:54.750> or<00:01:54.780> a

00:01:55.100 --> 00:01:55.110 
fitting you also can use a 45 or a

00:01:55.110 --> 00:01:56.749 
fitting you also can use a 45 or a
custom<00:01:55.530> degree<00:01:55.829> angle<00:01:56.189> depending<00:01:56.520> on<00:01:56.670> what

00:01:56.749 --> 00:01:56.759 
custom degree angle depending on what

00:01:56.759 --> 00:01:59.510 
custom degree angle depending on what
you<00:01:56.850> need<00:01:57.469> then<00:01:58.469> there's<00:01:58.710> the<00:01:58.860> easy<00:01:59.009> fit<00:01:59.369> up

00:01:59.510 --> 00:01:59.520 
you need then there's the easy fit up

00:01:59.520 --> 00:02:01.399 
you need then there's the easy fit up
verifier<00:02:00.090> which<00:02:00.390> gives<00:02:00.659> you<00:02:00.780> the<00:02:00.930> dimension

00:02:01.399 --> 00:02:01.409 
verifier which gives you the dimension
