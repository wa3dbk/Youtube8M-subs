first<00:00:04.830> welcome<00:00:05.279> to<00:00:05.399> prototype<00:00:05.819> of<00:00:06.029> the<00:00:06.210> One

00:00:06.620 --> 00:00:06.630 
first welcome to prototype of the One

00:00:06.630 --> 00:00:08.780 
first welcome to prototype of the One
Laptop<00:00:06.660> Per<00:00:07.020> child<00:00:07.410> budget<00:00:08.010> that<00:00:08.370> is<00:00:08.519> correct

00:00:08.780 --> 00:00:08.790 
Laptop Per child budget that is correct

00:00:08.790 --> 00:00:12.200 
Laptop Per child budget that is correct
and<00:00:09.120> what's<00:00:10.050> in<00:00:10.170> it<00:00:10.700> well<00:00:11.700> what<00:00:11.940> we<00:00:12.030> have<00:00:12.059> here

00:00:12.200 --> 00:00:12.210 
and what's in it well what we have here

00:00:12.210 --> 00:00:14.720 
and what's in it well what we have here
is<00:00:12.629> working<00:00:13.290> prototype<00:00:13.950> so<00:00:14.250> we've<00:00:14.490> got<00:00:14.700> a

00:00:14.720 --> 00:00:14.730 
is working prototype so we've got a

00:00:14.730 --> 00:00:16.760 
is working prototype so we've got a
working<00:00:15.269> display<00:00:15.660> this<00:00:15.780> as<00:00:15.870> a<00:00:15.929> model<00:00:16.170> display

00:00:16.760 --> 00:00:16.770 
working display this as a model display

00:00:16.770 --> 00:00:18.950 
working display this as a model display
until<00:00:16.950> we<00:00:17.160> finish<00:00:17.460> the<00:00:17.490> actual<00:00:17.970> display<00:00:18.240> in

00:00:18.950 --> 00:00:18.960 
until we finish the actual display in

00:00:18.960 --> 00:00:22.269 
until we finish the actual display in
behinds<00:00:19.590> way<00:00:19.800> you<00:00:19.859> can<00:00:20.160> actually<00:00:20.340> feel<00:00:21.330> the

00:00:22.269 --> 00:00:22.279 
behinds way you can actually feel the

00:00:22.279 --> 00:00:24.380 
behinds way you can actually feel the
mainboard<00:00:23.279> the<00:00:23.460> work<00:00:23.580> and<00:00:23.820> I<00:00:23.939> actually<00:00:24.090> use

00:00:24.380 --> 00:00:24.390 
mainboard the work and I actually use

00:00:24.390 --> 00:00:26.839 
mainboard the work and I actually use
and<00:00:24.599> this<00:00:24.660> is<00:00:24.840> a<00:00:24.869> one<00:00:25.710> of<00:00:25.800> the<00:00:25.859> test<00:00:26.070> boards<00:00:26.460> but

00:00:26.839 --> 00:00:26.849 
and this is a one of the test boards but

00:00:26.849 --> 00:00:28.490 
and this is a one of the test boards but
it<00:00:26.939> is<00:00:27.029> the<00:00:27.179> electronics<00:00:27.689> very<00:00:27.960> close<00:00:28.109> to<00:00:28.380> the

00:00:28.490 --> 00:00:28.500 
it is the electronics very close to the

00:00:28.500 --> 00:00:29.720 
it is the electronics very close to the
final<00:00:28.740> board<00:00:28.920> we're<00:00:29.070> going<00:00:29.189> to<00:00:29.250> use<00:00:29.400> so<00:00:29.519> it's<00:00:29.670> a

00:00:29.720 --> 00:00:29.730 
final board we're going to use so it's a

00:00:29.730 --> 00:00:32.630 
final board we're going to use so it's a
real<00:00:29.910> live<00:00:30.089> demo<00:00:31.070> we<00:00:32.070> do<00:00:32.220> have<00:00:32.369> a<00:00:32.430> working

00:00:32.630 --> 00:00:32.640 
real live demo we do have a working

00:00:32.640 --> 00:00:34.520 
real live demo we do have a working
display<00:00:33.000> that<00:00:33.210> goes<00:00:33.330> up<00:00:33.570> and<00:00:33.720> down<00:00:33.750> it

00:00:34.520 --> 00:00:34.530 
display that goes up and down it

00:00:34.530 --> 00:00:36.050 
display that goes up and down it
obviously<00:00:34.890> has<00:00:35.040> a<00:00:35.070> very<00:00:35.160> nice<00:00:35.430> handle<00:00:35.820> so<00:00:35.940> it's

00:00:36.050 --> 00:00:36.060 
obviously has a very nice handle so it's

00:00:36.060 --> 00:00:37.940 
obviously has a very nice handle so it's
very<00:00:36.180> easy<00:00:36.330> to<00:00:36.360> carry<00:00:36.660> back<00:00:37.620> and<00:00:37.770> forth

00:00:37.940 --> 00:00:37.950 
very easy to carry back and forth

00:00:37.950 --> 00:00:40.760 
very easy to carry back and forth
between<00:00:38.130> home<00:00:38.430> school<00:00:38.850> you<00:00:39.810> can<00:00:40.050> flip<00:00:40.590> this

00:00:40.760 --> 00:00:40.770 
between home school you can flip this

00:00:40.770 --> 00:00:42.530 
between home school you can flip this
around<00:00:40.830> and<00:00:41.160> fold<00:00:41.370> it<00:00:41.520> down<00:00:41.640> to<00:00:42.060> run<00:00:42.210> an<00:00:42.300> e-book

00:00:42.530 --> 00:00:42.540 
around and fold it down to run an e-book

00:00:42.540 --> 00:00:45.440 
around and fold it down to run an e-book
mode<00:00:42.860> there's<00:00:43.860> also<00:00:44.130> you<00:00:44.940> can<00:00:45.090> see<00:00:45.210> a<00:00:45.240> set<00:00:45.420> of

00:00:45.440 --> 00:00:45.450 
mode there's also you can see a set of

00:00:45.450 --> 00:00:47.270 
mode there's also you can see a set of
buttons<00:00:45.780> here<00:00:45.840> that<00:00:46.500> it<00:00:46.620> make<00:00:46.740> it<00:00:46.860> very<00:00:47.040> easy

00:00:47.270 --> 00:00:47.280 
buttons here that it make it very easy

00:00:47.280 --> 00:00:49.490 
buttons here that it make it very easy
to<00:00:47.400> use<00:00:47.700> when<00:00:48.510> it<00:00:48.630> is<00:00:48.750> in<00:00:48.930> that<00:00:49.050> mode<00:00:49.260> so<00:00:49.440> you

00:00:49.490 --> 00:00:49.500 
to use when it is in that mode so you

00:00:49.500 --> 00:00:51.830 
to use when it is in that mode so you
can<00:00:49.650> page<00:00:50.190> around<00:00:50.490> in<00:00:50.880> books<00:00:51.210> and<00:00:51.330> also<00:00:51.540> work

00:00:51.830 --> 00:00:51.840 
can page around in books and also work

00:00:51.840 --> 00:00:54.020 
can page around in books and also work
couraging<00:00:52.350> kids<00:00:52.560> to<00:00:52.710> use<00:00:52.830> games<00:00:53.100> as<00:00:53.280> well<00:00:53.460> so

00:00:54.020 --> 00:00:54.030 
couraging kids to use games as well so

00:00:54.030 --> 00:00:55.190 
couraging kids to use games as well so
they<00:00:54.120> will<00:00:54.270> be<00:00:54.390> able<00:00:54.510> to<00:00:54.630> use<00:00:54.720> it<00:00:54.840> for<00:00:54.990> playing

00:00:55.190 --> 00:00:55.200 
they will be able to use it for playing

00:00:55.200 --> 00:00:56.690 
they will be able to use it for playing
games<00:00:55.350> and<00:00:55.740> see<00:00:55.920> that<00:00:56.070> it<00:00:56.160> has<00:00:56.280> a<00:00:56.310> keyboard

00:00:56.690 --> 00:00:56.700 
games and see that it has a keyboard

00:00:56.700 --> 00:00:58.730 
games and see that it has a keyboard
that<00:00:57.270> is<00:00:57.360> pretty<00:00:57.600> well<00:00:57.810> sealed<00:00:58.200> I<00:00:58.350> mean<00:00:58.500> you

00:00:58.730 --> 00:00:58.740 
that is pretty well sealed I mean you

00:00:58.740 --> 00:01:00.170 
that is pretty well sealed I mean you
don't<00:00:58.800> want<00:00:58.980> to<00:00:59.040> get<00:00:59.190> in<00:00:59.280> water<00:00:59.640> but<00:00:59.940> it<00:01:00.030> should

00:01:00.170 --> 00:01:00.180 
don't want to get in water but it should

00:01:00.180 --> 00:01:01.940 
don't want to get in water but it should
keep<00:01:00.330> most<00:01:00.600> spills<00:01:00.810> and<00:01:01.170> dust<00:01:01.410> and<00:01:01.590> dirt<00:01:01.740> out

00:01:01.940 --> 00:01:01.950 
keep most spills and dust and dirt out

00:01:01.950 --> 00:01:03.920 
keep most spills and dust and dirt out
the<00:01:02.670> other<00:01:02.970> external<00:01:03.330> feature<00:01:03.600> that<00:01:03.780> we<00:01:03.900> have

00:01:03.920 --> 00:01:03.930 
the other external feature that we have

00:01:03.930 --> 00:01:06.050 
the other external feature that we have
are<00:01:04.350> basically<00:01:04.650> they<00:01:05.100> call<00:01:05.250> the<00:01:05.610> rabbit<00:01:05.880> ears

00:01:06.050 --> 00:01:06.060 
are basically they call the rabbit ears

00:01:06.060 --> 00:01:08.959 
are basically they call the rabbit ears
but<00:01:07.049> it<00:01:07.200> will<00:01:07.320> double<00:01:07.950> wireless<00:01:08.310> coverage<00:01:08.640> and

00:01:08.959 --> 00:01:08.969 
but it will double wireless coverage and

00:01:08.969 --> 00:01:10.520 
but it will double wireless coverage and
allow<00:01:09.119> the<00:01:09.420> mesh<00:01:09.600> network<00:01:09.899> to<00:01:10.049> work<00:01:10.170> much

00:01:10.520 --> 00:01:10.530 
allow the mesh network to work much

00:01:10.530 --> 00:01:12.740 
allow the mesh network to work much
better<00:01:10.799> we<00:01:11.490> can<00:01:11.579> help<00:01:11.820> Celeste<00:01:12.179> and<00:01:12.420> as<00:01:12.600> you

see can remove the bag to have it
replaced<00:01:34.950> it's<00:01:35.670> one<00:01:35.819> of<00:01:35.880> the<00:01:35.939> few<00:01:36.060> things<00:01:36.299> that

00:01:36.440 --> 00:01:36.450 
replaced it's one of the few things that

00:01:36.450 --> 00:01:38.419 
replaced it's one of the few things that
we<00:01:36.539> have<00:01:36.689> that's<00:01:36.990> easier<00:01:37.380> it's<00:01:37.950> gonna<00:01:38.219> be<00:01:38.399> a

00:01:38.429 --> 00:01:40.340 
we have that's easier it's gonna be a
standard<00:01:38.759> laptop<00:01:38.909> battery<00:01:39.329> or<00:01:39.689> it<00:01:39.929> is<00:01:40.140> known

00:01:40.340 --> 00:01:40.350 
standard laptop battery or it is known

00:01:40.350 --> 00:01:41.719 
standard laptop battery or it is known
as<00:01:40.469> the<00:01:40.499> laptop<00:01:40.859> battery<00:01:41.280> it's<00:01:41.429> actually<00:01:41.670> a

00:01:41.719 --> 00:01:41.729 
as the laptop battery it's actually a

00:01:41.729 --> 00:01:42.950 
as the laptop battery it's actually a
special<00:01:42.060> battery<00:01:42.210> that<00:01:42.390> we're<00:01:42.630> gonna<00:01:42.749> build

00:01:42.950 --> 00:01:42.960 
special battery that we're gonna build

00:01:42.960 --> 00:01:44.809 
special battery that we're gonna build
it's<00:01:43.200> pretty<00:01:43.499> standard<00:01:43.679> battery<00:01:44.310> but<00:01:44.520> it's<00:01:44.670> be

00:01:44.809 --> 00:01:44.819 
it's pretty standard battery but it's be

00:01:44.819 --> 00:01:46.819 
it's pretty standard battery but it's be
long<00:01:44.999> lifetime<00:01:45.479> you<00:01:46.020> provided<00:01:46.439> with<00:01:46.530> any<00:01:46.619> kind

00:01:46.819 --> 00:01:46.829 
long lifetime you provided with any kind

00:01:46.829 --> 00:01:49.819 
long lifetime you provided with any kind
of<00:01:46.889> power<00:01:47.219> in<00:01:47.549> it<00:01:48.289> so<00:01:49.289> it's<00:01:49.409> implementable

00:01:49.819 --> 00:01:49.829 
of power in it so it's implementable

00:01:49.829 --> 00:01:53.809 
of power in it so it's implementable
right<00:01:50.189> now<00:01:50.399> if<00:01:50.639> I<00:01:50.759> mentally<00:01:51.060> friendly<00:01:52.819> okay

00:01:53.809 --> 00:01:53.819 
right now if I mentally friendly okay

00:01:53.819 --> 00:01:56.470 
right now if I mentally friendly okay
let's

00:01:56.470 --> 00:01:56.480 

00:01:56.480 --> 00:01:59.180 

so<00:01:57.480> the<00:01:57.660> thing<00:01:57.810> about<00:01:57.960> the<00:01:58.080> monitor<00:01:58.440> is<00:01:58.710> that

00:01:59.180 --> 00:01:59.190 
so the thing about the monitor is that

00:01:59.190 --> 00:02:02.450 
so the thing about the monitor is that
the<00:01:59.490> flat<00:02:00.150> panel<00:02:00.420> has<00:02:00.690> two<00:02:00.930> modes<00:02:01.200> it<00:02:02.160> actually

00:02:02.450 --> 00:02:02.460 
the flat panel has two modes it actually

00:02:02.460 --> 00:02:07.960 
the flat panel has two modes it actually
runs<00:02:02.550> into<00:02:02.850> roughly<00:02:03.420> 640<00:02:04.110> by<00:02:04.200> 480<00:02:05.270> violence<00:02:06.270> oh

00:02:07.960 --> 00:02:07.970 
runs into roughly 640 by 480 violence oh

00:02:07.970 --> 00:02:10.279 
runs into roughly 640 by 480 violence oh
is<00:02:08.970> it<00:02:09.030> gonna<00:02:09.240> come<00:02:09.450> up<00:02:09.600> with<00:02:09.630> the<00:02:09.780> door<00:02:09.990> like

00:02:10.279 --> 00:02:10.289 
is it gonna come up with the door like

00:02:10.289 --> 00:02:12.680 
is it gonna come up with the door like
that<00:02:10.820> we<00:02:11.820> don't<00:02:12.000> know<00:02:12.060> we<00:02:12.270> don't<00:02:12.300> know<00:02:12.510> what

00:02:12.680 --> 00:02:12.690 
that we don't know we don't know what

00:02:12.690 --> 00:02:14.060 
that we don't know we don't know what
the<00:02:12.780> first<00:02:12.900> experience<00:02:13.410> is<00:02:13.500> gonna<00:02:13.620> be<00:02:13.709> but

00:02:14.060 --> 00:02:14.070 
the first experience is gonna be but

00:02:14.070 --> 00:02:15.830 
the first experience is gonna be but
this<00:02:14.190> is<00:02:14.250> you<00:02:14.790> know<00:02:14.910> this<00:02:15.060> is<00:02:15.120> just<00:02:15.480> how<00:02:15.720> do<00:02:15.780> we

00:02:15.830 --> 00:02:15.840 
this is you know this is just how do we

00:02:15.840 --> 00:02:17.480 
this is you know this is just how do we
get<00:02:16.020> Linux<00:02:16.320> running<00:02:16.560> on<00:02:16.709> it<00:02:16.890> we've<00:02:17.310> actually

00:02:17.480 --> 00:02:17.490 
get Linux running on it we've actually

00:02:17.490 --> 00:02:19.280 
get Linux running on it we've actually
got<00:02:17.760> a<00:02:17.820> miniature<00:02:18.420> distribution<00:02:18.959> which<00:02:19.110> this

00:02:19.280 --> 00:02:19.290 
got a miniature distribution which this

00:02:19.290 --> 00:02:23.330 
got a miniature distribution which this
is<00:02:19.470> not<00:02:19.680> which<00:02:20.400> will<00:02:20.640> allow<00:02:20.910> people<00:02:21.330> to<00:02:22.310> have<00:02:23.310> a

00:02:23.330 --> 00:02:23.340 
is not which will allow people to have a

00:02:23.340 --> 00:02:24.530 
is not which will allow people to have a
very<00:02:23.580> different<00:02:23.760> experience<00:02:23.970> what<00:02:24.420> we<00:02:24.510> have

00:02:24.530 --> 00:02:24.540 
very different experience what we have

00:02:24.540 --> 00:02:26.300 
very different experience what we have
in<00:02:24.750> the<00:02:24.810> car<00:02:24.990> desktop<00:02:25.380> but<00:02:26.040> it<00:02:26.100> is<00:02:26.190> running

00:02:26.300 --> 00:02:26.310 
in the car desktop but it is running

00:02:26.310 --> 00:02:28.070 
in the car desktop but it is running
Linux<00:02:26.760> that<00:02:27.120> is<00:02:27.300> the<00:02:27.390> main<00:02:27.570> board<00:02:27.810> that's

00:02:28.070 --> 00:02:28.080 
Linux that is the main board that's

00:02:28.080 --> 00:02:30.710 
Linux that is the main board that's
inside<00:02:28.350> of<00:02:28.380> it<00:02:28.970> doesn't<00:02:29.970> work<00:02:30.270> reasonably

00:02:30.710 --> 00:02:30.720 
inside of it doesn't work reasonably

00:02:30.720 --> 00:02:32.630 
inside of it doesn't work reasonably
well<00:02:30.930> and<00:02:31.260> this<00:02:31.650> is<00:02:31.709> a<00:02:31.830> pretty<00:02:31.980> standard<00:02:32.220> who<00:02:32.489> I

00:02:32.630 --> 00:02:32.640 
well and this is a pretty standard who I

00:02:32.640 --> 00:02:36.350 
well and this is a pretty standard who I
think<00:02:32.850> are<00:02:32.940> much<00:02:33.660> cleaner<00:02:33.900> than<00:02:34.170> us<00:02:35.180> can<00:02:36.180> hide

00:02:36.350 --> 00:02:36.360 
think are much cleaner than us can hide

00:02:36.360 --> 00:02:38.540 
think are much cleaner than us can hide
this<00:02:36.570> too<00:02:36.810> right<00:02:37.140> yeah<00:02:37.739> and<00:02:38.130> this<00:02:38.280> is<00:02:38.430> all

00:02:38.540 --> 00:02:38.550 
this too right yeah and this is all

00:02:38.550 --> 00:02:40.310 
this too right yeah and this is all
running<00:02:38.820> off<00:02:38.880> flash<00:02:39.330> memory<00:02:39.690> this<00:02:39.959> is<00:02:40.080> running

00:02:40.310 --> 00:02:40.320 
running off flash memory this is running

00:02:40.320 --> 00:02:42.199 
running off flash memory this is running
off<00:02:40.410> an<00:02:40.650> internal<00:02:40.950> flash<00:02:41.220> it's<00:02:41.940> somewhat

00:02:42.199 --> 00:02:42.209 
off an internal flash it's somewhat

00:02:42.209 --> 00:02:43.340 
off an internal flash it's somewhat
different<00:02:42.390> than<00:02:42.570> the<00:02:42.660> flash<00:02:42.870> that<00:02:43.050> will<00:02:43.140> be<00:02:43.260> in

00:02:43.340 --> 00:02:43.350 
different than the flash that will be in

00:02:43.350 --> 00:02:44.660 
different than the flash that will be in
the<00:02:43.410> final<00:02:43.680> board<00:02:43.890> what<00:02:44.070> they<00:02:44.190> did<00:02:44.340> was<00:02:44.520> they

00:02:44.660 --> 00:02:44.670 
the final board what they did was they

00:02:44.670 --> 00:02:48.350 
the final board what they did was they
put<00:02:45.030> a<00:02:45.510> 1<00:02:46.020> gigabyte<00:02:46.380> flash<00:02:46.860> ide<00:02:47.550> drive<00:02:48.090> on<00:02:48.270> the

00:02:48.350 --> 00:02:48.360 
put a 1 gigabyte flash ide drive on the

00:02:48.360 --> 00:02:50.420 
put a 1 gigabyte flash ide drive on the
inside<00:02:48.690> that<00:02:48.900> they<00:02:48.989> can<00:02:49.140> they<00:02:49.800> lift<00:02:49.950> pads<00:02:50.190> on

00:02:50.420 --> 00:02:50.430 
inside that they can they lift pads on

00:02:50.430 --> 00:02:52.810 
inside that they can they lift pads on
the<00:02:50.640> board<00:02:51.150> to<00:02:51.480> be<00:02:51.510> able<00:02:51.630> you<00:02:51.780> that<00:02:51.930> testing

00:02:52.810 --> 00:02:52.820 
the board to be able you that testing

00:02:52.820 --> 00:02:55.370 
the board to be able you that testing
that's<00:02:53.820> what<00:02:53.940> they<00:02:54.030> did<00:02:54.180> when<00:02:54.330> it<00:02:54.360> left

00:02:55.370 --> 00:02:55.380 
that's what they did when it left

00:02:55.380 --> 00:02:58.130 
that's what they did when it left
and<00:02:56.380> a<00:02:56.440> part<00:02:56.680> of<00:02:56.710> total<00:02:57.310> time<00:02:57.610> is<00:02:57.820> gonna<00:02:57.970> be

00:02:58.130 --> 00:02:58.140 
and a part of total time is gonna be

00:02:58.140 --> 00:03:01.140 
and a part of total time is gonna be
much<00:02:59.140> lower<00:02:59.320> than<00:02:59.440> this<00:02:59.680> okay

00:03:01.140 --> 00:03:01.150 
much lower than this okay

00:03:01.150 --> 00:03:03.210 
much lower than this okay
we're<00:03:01.540> hoping<00:03:01.810> we<00:03:01.990> can<00:03:02.050> do<00:03:02.230> it<00:03:02.350> in<00:03:02.470> a<00:03:02.860> matter<00:03:03.100> of

00:03:03.210 --> 00:03:03.220 
we're hoping we can do it in a matter of

00:03:03.220 --> 00:03:04.890 
we're hoping we can do it in a matter of
seconds<00:03:03.610> this<00:03:03.940> is<00:03:04.090> much<00:03:04.300> too<00:03:04.330> long<00:03:04.630> what's

00:03:04.890 --> 00:03:04.900 
seconds this is much too long what's

00:03:04.900 --> 00:03:06.390 
seconds this is much too long what's
going<00:03:05.170> to<00:03:05.260> the<00:03:05.380> standard<00:03:05.860> fedora<00:03:06.250> boot

00:03:06.390 --> 00:03:06.400 
going to the standard fedora boot

00:03:06.400 --> 00:03:12.720 
going to the standard fedora boot
process<00:03:06.610> for<00:03:07.600> sure<00:03:10.890> so<00:03:11.890> that's<00:03:12.070> all<00:03:12.700> done

00:03:12.720 --> 00:03:12.730 
process for sure so that's all done

00:03:12.730 --> 00:03:16.530 
process for sure so that's all done
right<00:03:13.060> yep<00:03:13.570> okay<00:03:14.790> so<00:03:15.790> what<00:03:16.240> do<00:03:16.300> you<00:03:16.360> have<00:03:16.420> on

00:03:16.530 --> 00:03:16.540 
right yep okay so what do you have on

there we don't actually have any

00:03:18.040 --> 00:03:22.770 
there we don't actually have any
programs<00:03:19.770> it<00:03:20.770> was<00:03:20.920> an<00:03:21.100> image<00:03:21.270> yeah<00:03:22.270> you<00:03:22.330> can<00:03:22.660> I

00:04:15.960 --> 00:04:15.970 
periphery device you can end on as the

00:04:15.970 --> 00:04:18.870 
periphery device you can end on as the
USB<00:04:16.680> software<00:04:17.680> updater<00:04:17.980> that's<00:04:18.220> awesome<00:04:18.609> file

there<00:04:22.390> so<00:04:22.660> as<00:04:23.020> scheduled<00:04:24.180> places<00:04:25.180> this<00:04:25.510> is<00:04:25.720> so

00:04:26.040 --> 00:04:26.050 
there so as scheduled places this is so

00:04:26.050 --> 00:04:28.950 
there so as scheduled places this is so
home<00:04:26.650> school<00:04:27.270> they<00:04:28.270> central<00:04:28.600> but<00:04:28.720> also<00:04:28.840> much

00:04:28.950 --> 00:04:28.960 
home school they central but also much

00:04:28.960 --> 00:04:30.540 
home school they central but also much
of<00:04:28.990> things<00:04:29.260> in<00:04:29.350> there<00:04:29.500> although<00:04:30.010> I<00:04:30.130> think<00:04:30.280> if

00:04:30.540 --> 00:04:30.550 
of things in there although I think if

00:04:30.550 --> 00:04:32.460 
of things in there although I think if
you<00:04:30.670> just<00:04:30.700> I<00:04:31.150> don't<00:04:31.200> set<00:04:32.200> expectations

00:04:32.460 --> 00:04:32.470 
you just I don't set expectations

00:04:32.470 --> 00:04:34.290 
you just I don't set expectations
properly<00:04:32.950> I<00:04:33.190> think<00:04:33.280> the<00:04:33.520> final<00:04:33.790> interface<00:04:34.150> is

00:04:34.290 --> 00:04:34.300 
properly I think the final interface is

00:04:34.300 --> 00:04:35.280 
properly I think the final interface is
gonna<00:04:34.450> look<00:04:34.510> very<00:04:34.780> different<00:04:35.050> than<00:04:35.170> this

00:04:35.280 --> 00:04:35.290 
gonna look very different than this

00:04:35.290 --> 00:04:38.070 
gonna look very different than this
hurts<00:04:35.920> okay<00:04:36.250> the<00:04:36.460> API<00:04:36.700> toolkit<00:04:37.210> yes<00:04:37.630> you<00:04:37.780> know

00:04:38.070 --> 00:04:38.080 
hurts okay the API toolkit yes you know

00:04:38.080 --> 00:04:39.780 
hurts okay the API toolkit yes you know
we'll<00:04:38.200> have<00:04:38.290> that<00:04:38.530> still<00:04:39.010> have<00:04:39.130> an<00:04:39.220> SDK<00:04:39.490> with

00:04:39.780 --> 00:04:39.790 
we'll have that still have an SDK with

00:04:39.790 --> 00:04:41.010 
we'll have that still have an SDK with
it<00:04:39.910> for<00:04:40.060> school<00:04:40.210> you<00:04:40.390> know<00:04:40.450> that<00:04:40.600> will<00:04:40.870> get

00:04:41.010 --> 00:04:41.020 
it for school you know that will get

00:04:41.020 --> 00:04:43.080 
it for school you know that will get
free<00:04:41.140> shipping<00:04:41.170> and<00:04:41.940> actually<00:04:42.940> think<00:04:43.060> about

00:04:43.080 --> 00:04:43.090 
free shipping and actually think about

00:04:43.090 --> 00:04:44.580 
free shipping and actually think about
change<00:04:43.419> they<00:04:43.570> have<00:04:43.660> application<00:04:44.200> model<00:04:44.470> to

00:04:44.580 --> 00:04:44.590 
change they have application model to

00:04:44.590 --> 00:04:46.350 
change they have application model to
quite<00:04:44.860> a<00:04:44.890> bit<00:04:45.100> so<00:04:45.340> it's<00:04:45.490> really<00:04:45.760> easy<00:04:46.030> to<00:04:46.180> build

00:04:46.350 --> 00:04:46.360 
quite a bit so it's really easy to build

00:04:46.360 --> 00:04:55.839 
quite a bit so it's really easy to build
an<00:04:46.510> application<00:04:46.630> in<00:04:47.200> deployment

00:04:55.839 --> 00:04:55.849 

00:04:55.849 --> 00:04:57.909 

you
