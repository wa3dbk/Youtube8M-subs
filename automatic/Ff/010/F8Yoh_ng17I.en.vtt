that's something I'm hoping we see at
some<00:02:36.350> point<00:02:36.560> I'm<00:02:36.740> not<00:02:36.950> sure<00:02:37.160> if<00:02:37.250> we<00:02:37.370> will<00:02:37.520> but

00:02:38.110 --> 00:02:38.120 
some point I'm not sure if we will but

00:02:38.120 --> 00:02:40.630 
some point I'm not sure if we will but
you<00:02:38.510> know<00:02:38.630> having<00:02:39.170> a<00:02:39.380> cod<00:02:39.680> champs<00:02:40.130> dedicated

direction<00:02:42.830> so<00:02:43.370> hopefully<00:02:43.700> at<00:02:43.760> some<00:02:43.820> point<00:02:43.970> we

00:02:44.199 --> 00:02:44.209 
direction so hopefully at some point we

00:02:44.209 --> 00:02:45.310 
direction so hopefully at some point we
can<00:02:44.240> see<00:02:44.450> something<00:02:44.660> like<00:02:44.750> that<00:02:44.900> but<00:02:45.080> some
