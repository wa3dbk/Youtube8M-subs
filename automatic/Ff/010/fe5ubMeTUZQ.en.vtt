I<00:01:06.330> can't<00:01:06.900> really<00:01:07.200> hear<00:01:07.440> I<00:01:07.680> can't<00:01:08.130> hear<00:01:08.369> it<00:01:08.400> but

00:01:08.690 --> 00:01:08.700 
I can't really hear I can't hear it but

00:01:08.700 --> 00:01:09.830 
I can't really hear I can't hear it but
I<00:01:08.729> don't<00:01:08.820> know<00:01:09.030> if<00:01:09.090> you're<00:01:09.299> the<00:01:09.330> elder<00:01:09.630> here

00:01:09.830 --> 00:01:09.840 
I don't know if you're the elder here

00:01:09.840 --> 00:01:12.950 
I don't know if you're the elder here
because<00:01:10.290> I<00:01:10.530> think<00:01:11.220> most<00:01:12.090> of<00:01:12.270> that<00:01:12.450> was<00:01:12.659> smooth

00:01:12.950 --> 00:01:12.960 
because I think most of that was smooth

00:01:12.960 --> 00:01:14.300 
because I think most of that was smooth
the<00:01:13.350> keyboard

00:01:14.300 --> 00:01:14.310 
the keyboard

00:01:14.310 --> 00:01:17.890 
the keyboard
they<00:01:14.460> had<00:01:14.580> my<00:01:14.700> desk<00:01:15.060> I<00:01:15.860> pushed<00:01:16.860> down<00:01:17.010> too<00:01:17.430> much

00:01:17.890 --> 00:01:17.900 
they had my desk I pushed down too much

00:01:17.900 --> 00:01:21.499 
they had my desk I pushed down too much
and<00:01:18.900> it<00:01:19.440> sort<00:01:19.710> of<00:01:19.770> bashed<00:01:20.159> into<00:01:20.550> the<00:01:20.759> metal<00:01:21.210> the

00:01:21.499 --> 00:01:21.509 
and it sort of bashed into the metal the

00:01:21.509 --> 00:01:24.350 
and it sort of bashed into the metal the
old<00:01:22.049> fashioned<00:01:22.590> to<00:01:22.710> the<00:01:22.800> metal<00:01:23.130> so<00:01:23.369> that's

00:01:24.350 --> 00:01:24.360 
old fashioned to the metal so that's

00:01:24.360 --> 00:01:26.899 
old fashioned to the metal so that's
going<00:01:25.200> to<00:01:25.290> be<00:01:25.380> partly<00:01:25.890> what<00:01:26.009> that<00:01:26.159> was<00:01:26.369> and<00:01:26.700> the

00:01:26.899 --> 00:01:26.909 
going to be partly what that was and the

00:01:26.909 --> 00:01:30.170 
going to be partly what that was and the
metal<00:01:27.240> hitting<00:01:27.420> limit<00:01:27.780> and<00:01:28.490> as<00:01:29.490> I<00:01:29.550> hit<00:01:29.850> it<00:01:29.880> down

00:01:30.170 --> 00:01:30.180 
metal hitting limit and as I hit it down

00:01:30.180 --> 00:01:31.550 
metal hitting limit and as I hit it down
quite<00:01:30.509> odd

00:01:31.550 --> 00:01:31.560 
quite odd

00:01:31.560 --> 00:01:34.250 
quite odd
and

00:01:34.250 --> 00:01:34.260
