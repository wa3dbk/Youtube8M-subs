can help them and so that's why I'm

00:02:28.660 --> 00:02:32.100 
can help them and so that's why I'm
doing<00:02:28.810> this<00:02:29.160> surgery<00:02:30.160> is<00:02:30.490> is<00:02:31.110> controlled

00:02:32.100 --> 00:02:32.110 
doing this surgery is is controlled

00:02:32.110 --> 00:02:35.660 
doing this surgery is is controlled

trauma it's traumatic to get to the body
it's<00:02:36.670> controlled<00:02:37.120> but<00:02:37.270> still<00:02:37.540> traumatic<00:02:38.110> and

00:02:38.250 --> 00:02:38.260 
it's controlled but still traumatic and

00:02:38.260 --> 00:02:40.350 
it's controlled but still traumatic and

00:02:40.350 --> 00:02:40.360 
the amount of trauma kabaddi depends

00:02:40.360 --> 00:02:43.590 
the amount of trauma kabaddi depends
upon<00:02:40.510> what<00:02:41.500> type<00:02:41.560> of<00:02:41.880> what<00:02:42.880> type<00:02:43.060> of<00:02:43.090> disease

00:02:43.590 --> 00:02:43.600 
upon what type of what type of disease

00:02:43.600 --> 00:02:45.210 
upon what type of what type of disease
they<00:02:43.780> have<00:02:43.930> but<00:02:44.080> it<00:02:44.200> also<00:02:44.320> depends<00:02:44.770> on<00:02:44.920> how<00:02:45.160> the

00:02:45.210 --> 00:02:45.220 
they have but it also depends on how the

00:02:45.220 --> 00:02:47.910 
they have but it also depends on how the
surgery<00:02:45.640> is<00:02:45.910> done<00:02:46.290> so<00:02:47.290> there's<00:02:47.500> a<00:02:47.590> huge

00:02:47.910 --> 00:02:47.920 
surgery is done so there's a huge

00:02:47.920 --> 00:02:49.199 
surgery is done so there's a huge
difference<00:02:48.130> in<00:02:48.489> terms<00:02:48.730> of<00:02:48.850> the<00:02:48.940> amount<00:02:49.000> of
