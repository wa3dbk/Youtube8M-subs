netting I've got a support line here and
then<00:00:32.910> I<00:00:33.270> create<00:00:33.809> my<00:00:33.930> meshes<00:00:34.320> along<00:00:34.649> to<00:00:34.950> support

00:00:35.060 --> 00:00:35.070 
then I create my meshes along to support

00:00:35.070 --> 00:00:40.280 
then I create my meshes along to support
line<00:00:35.780> I've<00:00:36.780> got<00:00:37.079> some<00:00:38.030> natural<00:00:39.030> example<00:00:39.840> here

00:00:46.190 --> 00:00:46.200 
kind of real quick on creating this net

00:00:46.200 --> 00:00:48.650 
kind of real quick on creating this net
to<00:00:47.100> get<00:00:47.219> to<00:00:47.579> get<00:00:47.700> practice<00:00:48.120> I<00:00:48.210> creating<00:00:48.570> the

00:00:48.650 --> 00:00:48.660 
to get to get practice I creating the

00:00:48.660 --> 00:00:52.189 
to get to get practice I creating the
knots<00:00:48.870> and<00:00:49.140> I<00:00:49.770> was<00:00:49.890> using<00:00:50.070> this<00:00:50.340> gauge<00:00:51.020> to<00:00:52.020> do

00:00:52.189 --> 00:00:52.199 
knots and I was using this gauge to do

00:00:52.199 --> 00:00:54.650 
knots and I was using this gauge to do
so<00:00:52.469> not<00:00:52.860> very<00:00:52.920> big<00:00:53.309> but<00:00:53.550> just<00:00:53.579> something<00:00:54.000> to<00:00:54.149> to

00:00:54.650 --> 00:00:54.660 
so not very big but just something to to

00:00:54.660 --> 00:01:01.520 
so not very big but just something to to
practice<00:00:55.110> with<00:00:55.320> um<00:00:58.070> here's<00:00:59.070> a<00:00:59.309> net<00:01:00.300> that<00:01:01.050> I

00:01:01.520 --> 00:01:01.530 
practice with um here's a net that I

00:01:01.530 --> 00:01:03.380 
practice with um here's a net that I
made<00:01:01.980> with<00:01:02.280> some<00:01:02.430> quarters<00:01:02.820> I<00:01:02.969> had<00:01:03.180> to

00:01:03.380 --> 00:01:03.390 
made with some quarters I had to

00:01:03.390 --> 00:01:06.140 
made with some quarters I had to
surround<00:01:03.809> the<00:01:03.930> house<00:01:04.140> here<00:01:04.559> and<00:01:04.939> this<00:01:05.939> is<00:01:06.119> a

00:01:06.140 --> 00:01:06.150 
surround the house here and this is a

00:01:06.150 --> 00:01:10.010 
surround the house here and this is a
fairly<00:01:06.450> big<00:01:06.780> one<00:01:08.210> and<00:01:09.210> it's<00:01:09.390> just<00:01:09.450> kind<00:01:09.689> of<00:01:09.750> fun

00:01:10.010 --> 00:01:10.020 
fairly big one and it's just kind of fun

00:01:10.020 --> 00:01:13.910 
fairly big one and it's just kind of fun
to<00:01:11.030> practice<00:01:12.030> trying<00:01:13.020> to<00:01:13.110> get<00:01:13.290> consistence

able<00:02:27.590> to<00:02:27.769> make<00:02:27.890> a<00:02:27.920> triangular<00:02:28.720> net<00:02:32.260> before<00:02:33.260> we

00:02:33.369 --> 00:02:33.379 
able to make a triangular net before we

00:02:33.379 --> 00:02:36.309 
able to make a triangular net before we
begin<00:02:33.709> I'm<00:02:34.280> going<00:02:34.340> to<00:02:34.909> set<00:02:35.569> up<00:02:35.689> the<00:02:35.810> demo<00:02:36.019> and

00:02:36.309 --> 00:02:36.319 
begin I'm going to set up the demo and

00:02:36.319 --> 00:02:38.679 
begin I'm going to set up the demo and
explain<00:02:36.769> a<00:02:36.799> couple<00:02:37.069> of<00:02:37.310> things<00:02:37.489> a<00:02:37.939> lot<00:02:38.659> of

00:02:38.679 --> 00:02:38.689 
explain a couple of things a lot of

00:02:38.689 --> 00:02:42.610 
explain a couple of things a lot of
larger<00:02:39.079> detail<00:02:40.569> I'm<00:02:41.569> kind<00:02:41.959> of<00:02:42.019> behind<00:02:42.469> the

00:02:42.610 --> 00:02:42.620 
larger detail I'm kind of behind the

00:02:42.620 --> 00:02:44.199 
larger detail I'm kind of behind the
camera<00:02:43.129> and<00:02:43.189> I<00:02:43.250> hope<00:02:43.400> I<00:02:43.489> don't<00:02:43.549> bump<00:02:43.849> it<00:02:44.030> too

00:02:44.199 --> 00:02:44.209 
camera and I hope I don't bump it too

00:02:44.209 --> 00:02:46.449 
camera and I hope I don't bump it too
much<00:02:44.420> there's<00:02:45.139> a<00:02:45.200> lot<00:02:45.349> of<00:02:45.530> hand<00:02:45.889> work<00:02:46.099> that<00:02:46.340> is

00:02:46.449 --> 00:02:46.459 
much there's a lot of hand work that is

00:02:46.459 --> 00:02:48.729 
much there's a lot of hand work that is
involved<00:02:46.819> so<00:02:47.209> I'll<00:02:47.540> do<00:02:47.720> my<00:02:47.750> best<00:02:48.049> to<00:02:48.409> and<00:02:48.650> not

00:02:48.729 --> 00:02:48.739 
involved so I'll do my best to and not

00:02:48.739 --> 00:02:52.000 
involved so I'll do my best to and not
be<00:02:48.950> too<00:02:49.129> shaky<00:02:49.430> with<00:02:49.639> the<00:02:49.730> camera<00:02:50.090> um<00:02:51.010> right

00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:52.010 
be too shaky with the camera um right

00:02:52.010 --> 00:02:54.309 
be too shaky with the camera um right
now<00:02:52.040> I've<00:02:52.400> just<00:02:52.459> taken<00:02:52.970> this<00:02:53.329> I've<00:02:53.870> taken<00:02:54.079> a

00:02:54.309 --> 00:02:54.319 
now I've just taken this I've taken a

00:02:54.319 --> 00:02:59.679 
now I've just taken this I've taken a
couple<00:02:54.620> of<00:02:56.169> wire<00:02:57.169> hanger<00:02:57.680> hooks<00:02:58.450> clip<00:02:59.450> them

00:02:59.679 --> 00:02:59.689 
couple of wire hanger hooks clip them

00:02:59.689 --> 00:03:02.500 
couple of wire hanger hooks clip them
and<00:02:59.919> then<00:03:00.919> bent<00:03:01.220> them<00:03:01.430> over<00:03:01.760> and<00:03:01.970> made<00:03:02.329> the

00:03:02.500 --> 00:03:02.510 
and then bent them over and made the

00:03:02.510 --> 00:03:06.970 
and then bent them over and made the
loop<00:03:02.689> perpendicular<00:03:03.590> to<00:03:04.720> the<00:03:05.720> hook<00:03:05.980> that's

00:03:06.970 --> 00:03:06.980 
loop perpendicular to the hook that's

00:03:06.980 --> 00:03:08.289 
loop perpendicular to the hook that's
just<00:03:07.159> because<00:03:07.280> the<00:03:07.549> cutting<00:03:07.819> board<00:03:08.030> that<00:03:08.090> I'm

00:03:08.289 --> 00:03:08.299 
just because the cutting board that I'm

00:03:08.299 --> 00:03:11.409 
just because the cutting board that I'm
on<00:03:08.480> I<00:03:08.510> can<00:03:08.810> hook<00:03:09.019> on<00:03:09.200> to<00:03:09.379> the<00:03:09.409> edges<00:03:10.419> normally

00:03:11.409 --> 00:03:11.419 
on I can hook on to the edges normally

00:03:11.419 --> 00:03:14.409 
on I can hook on to the edges normally
you<00:03:11.599> know<00:03:11.689> if<00:03:11.840> you're<00:03:12.139> out<00:03:12.650> and<00:03:13.010> about<00:03:13.419> outside

00:03:14.409 --> 00:03:14.419 
you know if you're out and about outside

00:03:14.419 --> 00:03:17.080 
you know if you're out and about outside
you<00:03:14.750> probably<00:03:14.959> you<00:03:15.500> know<00:03:15.650> hook<00:03:16.489> this<00:03:16.669> around<00:03:16.970> a

00:03:17.080 --> 00:03:17.090 
you probably you know hook this around a

00:03:17.090 --> 00:03:19.960 
you probably you know hook this around a
tree<00:03:17.389> with<00:03:18.109> some<00:03:18.260> cordage<00:03:18.680> or<00:03:19.069> create<00:03:19.940> a

00:03:19.960 --> 00:03:19.970 
tree with some cordage or create a

00:03:19.970 --> 00:03:22.750 
tree with some cordage or create a
support<00:03:20.780> line<00:03:20.989> with<00:03:21.919> your<00:03:22.099> with<00:03:22.549> you<00:03:22.669> know

support line with your with you know
with<00:03:22.940> the<00:03:22.970> cordage<00:03:23.449> from<00:03:24.229> one<00:03:24.379> post<00:03:24.650> or<00:03:24.949> one

00:03:25.059 --> 00:03:25.069 
with the cordage from one post or one

00:03:25.069 --> 00:03:27.670 
with the cordage from one post or one
tree<00:03:25.250> to<00:03:25.400> another<00:03:25.459> but<00:03:26.090> not<00:03:26.870> outside<00:03:27.260> because

00:03:27.670 --> 00:03:27.680 
tree to another but not outside because

00:03:27.680 --> 00:03:30.069 
tree to another but not outside because
it's<00:03:27.859> a<00:03:28.129> few<00:03:28.970> degrees<00:03:29.090> below<00:03:29.389> zero<00:03:29.900> outside

00:03:30.069 --> 00:03:30.079 
it's a few degrees below zero outside

00:03:30.079 --> 00:03:33.069 
it's a few degrees below zero outside
today<00:03:30.500> so<00:03:30.769> I<00:03:31.489> wanted<00:03:32.329> for<00:03:32.540> this<00:03:32.629> demo<00:03:32.870> I<00:03:33.019> just

00:03:33.069 --> 00:03:33.079 
today so I wanted for this demo I just

00:03:33.079 --> 00:03:35.409 
today so I wanted for this demo I just
went<00:03:33.440> ahead<00:03:33.530> and<00:03:33.949> put<00:03:34.549> together<00:03:34.669> these<00:03:35.359> a

00:03:35.409 --> 00:03:35.419 
went ahead and put together these a

00:03:35.419 --> 00:03:36.369 
went ahead and put together these a
couple<00:03:35.780> of<00:03:36.019> hooks

00:03:36.369 --> 00:03:36.379 
couple of hooks

00:03:36.379 --> 00:03:40.599 
couple of hooks
so<00:03:36.909> to<00:03:37.909> begin<00:03:38.090> uh<00:03:39.010> what<00:03:40.010> I'm<00:03:40.099> going<00:03:40.250> to<00:03:40.280> do<00:03:40.459> is

I'm going to take a little piece of

00:03:42.409 --> 00:03:44.319 
I'm going to take a little piece of
cordage<00:03:42.680> here<00:03:42.979> and<00:03:43.400> I'm<00:03:43.549> going<00:03:43.729> to<00:03:43.790> start<00:03:44.209> a

00:03:44.319 --> 00:03:44.329 
cordage here and I'm going to start a

00:03:44.329 --> 00:03:48.189 
cordage here and I'm going to start a
leader<00:03:44.629> arm<00:03:45.639> leader<00:03:46.639> loop<00:03:46.940> here<00:03:47.720> with<00:03:48.049> my

00:03:48.189 --> 00:03:48.199 
leader arm leader loop here with my

00:03:48.199 --> 00:03:50.649 
leader arm leader loop here with my
cordage<00:03:48.620> make<00:03:49.340> sure<00:03:49.489> the<00:03:49.609> ends<00:03:49.940> are<00:03:50.000> even<00:03:50.209> and

00:03:50.649 --> 00:03:50.659 
cordage make sure the ends are even and

00:03:50.659 --> 00:03:52.149 
cordage make sure the ends are even and
then<00:03:51.139> I'm<00:03:51.260> just<00:03:51.349> going<00:03:51.530> to<00:03:51.620> do<00:03:51.769> a<00:03:51.799> simple

00:03:58.479 --> 00:03:58.489 
standing ends here or running ends I

00:03:58.489 --> 00:04:00.490 
standing ends here or running ends I
should<00:03:58.669> say<00:03:58.849> and<00:03:59.689> I<00:04:00.019> was<00:04:00.139> going<00:04:00.260> to<00:04:00.349> come

about<00:04:01.519> a<00:04:01.549> little<00:04:01.790> bit<00:04:02.090> of<00:04:02.180> Matt<00:04:02.389> terminology

00:04:03.099 --> 00:04:03.109 
about a little bit of Matt terminology

00:04:03.109 --> 00:04:07.300 
about a little bit of Matt terminology
there<00:04:03.939> running<00:04:04.939> in<00:04:05.120> and<00:04:05.530> loops<00:04:06.530> and<00:04:06.829> bites<00:04:07.040> and

00:04:07.300 --> 00:04:07.310 
there running in and loops and bites and

00:04:07.310 --> 00:04:10.420 
there running in and loops and bites and
whatnot<00:04:07.609> um<00:04:08.439> and<00:04:09.439> that<00:04:09.620> computer<00:04:09.919> bites<00:04:10.250> oh

00:04:10.420 --> 00:04:10.430 
whatnot um and that computer bites oh

00:04:10.430 --> 00:04:13.059 
whatnot um and that computer bites oh
yeah<00:04:10.669> actually<00:04:10.930> alright<00:04:11.930> so<00:04:12.229> basically<00:04:12.769> I

yeah actually alright so basically I
want<00:04:13.250> to<00:04:13.310> create<00:04:13.519> a<00:04:13.609> configuration<00:04:14.269> like<00:04:14.479> this

00:04:14.649 --> 00:04:14.659 
want to create a configuration like this

00:04:14.659 --> 00:04:16.539 
want to create a configuration like this
okay<00:04:15.379> so<00:04:15.439> I'm<00:04:15.680> gonna<00:04:15.829> hook<00:04:15.919> this<00:04:16.070> to<00:04:16.250> the<00:04:16.340> top

00:04:16.539 --> 00:04:16.549 
okay so I'm gonna hook this to the top

00:04:16.549 --> 00:04:19.870 
okay so I'm gonna hook this to the top
of<00:04:16.729> my<00:04:16.849> cutting<00:04:17.269> board<00:04:17.650> and<00:04:18.699> that's<00:04:19.699> going<00:04:19.820> to

00:04:19.870 --> 00:04:19.880 
of my cutting board and that's going to

00:04:19.880 --> 00:04:22.480 
of my cutting board and that's going to
be<00:04:20.000> my<00:04:20.150> leader<00:04:20.389> line<00:04:20.690> right<00:04:21.169> there

00:04:22.480 --> 00:04:22.490 
be my leader line right there

00:04:22.490 --> 00:04:25.460 
be my leader line right there
net<00:04:23.490> the<00:04:23.880> net<00:04:23.910> netting<00:04:24.510> seems<00:04:24.930> to<00:04:25.050> be<00:04:25.170> just<00:04:25.290> a

net the net netting seems to be just a

00:04:25.470 --> 00:04:28.580 
net the net netting seems to be just a
series<00:04:25.830> of<00:04:25.920> knots<00:04:26.370> and<00:04:26.820> it's<00:04:27.270> a<00:04:27.450> special<00:04:28.290> knot

00:04:28.580 --> 00:04:28.590 
series of knots and it's a special knot

00:04:28.590 --> 00:04:30.890

it's<00:04:29.010> a<00:04:29.070> particular<00:04:29.550> knot<00:04:29.730> called<00:04:30.060> a<00:04:30.270> sheet

00:04:30.890 --> 00:04:30.900 
it's a particular knot called a sheet

00:04:30.900 --> 00:04:34.010 
it's a particular knot called a sheet
Bend<00:04:31.140> and<00:04:31.650> I<00:04:32.640> forgot<00:04:33.060> some<00:04:33.270> smaller<00:04:33.570> quarters

00:04:34.010 --> 00:04:34.020 
Bend and I forgot some smaller quarters

00:04:34.020 --> 00:04:35.600 
Bend and I forgot some smaller quarters
so<00:04:34.140> I<00:04:34.200> could<00:04:34.380> fit<00:04:34.560> it<00:04:34.680> on<00:04:34.800> fitted<00:04:35.490> on<00:04:35.580> the

00:04:35.600 --> 00:04:35.610 
so I could fit it on fitted on the

00:04:35.610 --> 00:04:38.210 
so I could fit it on fitted on the
shuttle<00:04:36.200> but<00:04:37.200> I<00:04:37.230> have<00:04:37.410> some<00:04:37.620> larger<00:04:37.950> larger

00:04:38.210 --> 00:04:38.220 
shuttle but I have some larger larger

00:04:38.220 --> 00:04:42.200 
shuttle but I have some larger larger
cordage<00:04:38.760> here<00:04:38.790> I<00:04:39.000> want<00:04:39.390> to<00:04:39.630> explain<00:04:40.760> in<00:04:41.760> larger

00:04:42.200 --> 00:04:42.210 
cordage here I want to explain in larger

00:04:42.210 --> 00:04:44.690 
cordage here I want to explain in larger
detail<00:04:42.690> so<00:04:43.500> that<00:04:43.680> you<00:04:43.920> know<00:04:44.010> I<00:04:44.040> don't<00:04:44.130> have<00:04:44.670> a

00:04:44.690 --> 00:04:44.700 
detail so that you know I don't have a

00:04:44.700 --> 00:04:46.790 
detail so that you know I don't have a
lot<00:04:44.940> of<00:04:44.970> a<00:04:45.390> lot<00:04:45.750> of<00:04:45.840> control<00:04:46.170> over<00:04:46.320> the<00:04:46.410> camera

00:04:46.790 --> 00:04:46.800 
lot of a lot of control over the camera

00:04:46.800 --> 00:04:49.040 
lot of a lot of control over the camera
zoom<00:04:47.010> and<00:04:47.220> whatnot<00:04:47.520> so<00:04:48.180> I've<00:04:48.480> decided<00:04:48.720> to

00:04:49.040 --> 00:04:49.050 
zoom and whatnot so I've decided to

00:04:49.050 --> 00:04:51.170 
zoom and whatnot so I've decided to
break<00:04:49.230> this<00:04:49.410> up<00:04:49.620> so<00:04:49.830> that<00:04:49.980> I<00:04:50.160> can<00:04:50.580> explain<00:04:50.940> this

00:04:51.170 --> 00:04:51.180 
break this up so that I can explain this

00:04:51.180 --> 00:04:53.150 
break this up so that I can explain this
in<00:04:51.420> larger<00:04:52.080> detail<00:04:52.440> and<00:04:52.620> I'll<00:04:52.710> go<00:04:52.830> over<00:04:52.950> it

00:04:53.150 --> 00:04:53.160 
in larger detail and I'll go over it

00:04:53.160 --> 00:04:57.050 
in larger detail and I'll go over it
again<00:04:53.220> I<00:04:53.840> want<00:04:54.840> to<00:04:54.930> create<00:04:55.110> a<00:04:55.200> bite<00:04:55.880> I'm<00:04:56.880> going

00:04:57.050 --> 00:04:57.060 
again I want to create a bite I'm going

00:04:57.060 --> 00:04:59.810 
again I want to create a bite I'm going
to<00:04:57.120> kind<00:04:57.270> of<00:04:57.300> hold<00:04:57.660> the<00:04:57.960> bite<00:04:58.140> here<00:04:58.530> and<00:04:59.340> I<00:04:59.640> want

00:04:59.810 --> 00:04:59.820 
to kind of hold the bite here and I want

00:04:59.820 --> 00:05:02.420 
to kind of hold the bite here and I want
to<00:04:59.880> take<00:05:00.090> my<00:05:00.300> running<00:05:00.870> end<00:05:01.110> and<00:05:01.350> run<00:05:02.310> it

00:05:02.420 --> 00:05:02.430 
to take my running end and run it

00:05:02.430 --> 00:05:07.220 
to take my running end and run it
through<00:05:03.890> this<00:05:04.890> initial<00:05:05.430> Bend<00:05:05.670> or<00:05:05.940> a<00:05:05.970> bite<00:05:06.360> bend

00:05:07.220 --> 00:05:07.230 
through this initial Bend or a bite bend

00:05:07.230 --> 00:05:09.500 
through this initial Bend or a bite bend
in<00:05:07.350> the<00:05:07.440> cordage<00:05:07.800> and<00:05:08.090> then<00:05:09.090> I'm<00:05:09.270> going<00:05:09.420> to

00:05:09.500 --> 00:05:09.510 
in the cordage and then I'm going to

00:05:09.510 --> 00:05:13.150 
in the cordage and then I'm going to
hold<00:05:10.340> where<00:05:11.340> they<00:05:11.460> intersect<00:05:11.790> together<00:05:12.390> I

00:05:13.150 --> 00:05:13.160 
hold where they intersect together I

00:05:13.160 --> 00:05:17.060 
hold where they intersect together I
want<00:05:14.160> to<00:05:14.250> take<00:05:14.490> my<00:05:15.060> running<00:05:15.510> end<00:05:15.690> and<00:05:15.950> run<00:05:16.950> it

00:05:17.060 --> 00:05:17.070 
want to take my running end and run it

00:05:17.070 --> 00:05:21.410 
want to take my running end and run it
around<00:05:17.400> my<00:05:17.640> hand<00:05:17.880> or<00:05:18.180> my<00:05:18.990> thumb<00:05:19.260> I<00:05:20.240> want<00:05:21.240> it<00:05:21.330> to

00:05:21.410 --> 00:05:21.420 
around my hand or my thumb I want it to

00:05:21.420 --> 00:05:26.200 
around my hand or my thumb I want it to
go<00:05:21.540> through<00:05:21.750> this<00:05:22.290> loop<00:05:24.110> behind<00:05:25.110> everything

00:05:26.200 --> 00:05:26.210 
go through this loop behind everything

00:05:26.210 --> 00:05:29.300 
go through this loop behind everything
like<00:05:27.210> so<00:05:27.510> and<00:05:27.810> then<00:05:28.410> I<00:05:28.440> want<00:05:28.620> to<00:05:28.680> pull<00:05:29.010> this

00:05:29.300 --> 00:05:29.310 
like so and then I want to pull this

00:05:29.310 --> 00:05:32.570 
like so and then I want to pull this
through<00:05:29.910> my<00:05:30.840> the<00:05:31.650> loop<00:05:31.830> that<00:05:32.010> went<00:05:32.190> around<00:05:32.370> my

00:05:32.570 --> 00:05:32.580 
through my the loop that went around my

00:05:32.580 --> 00:05:35.450 
through my the loop that went around my
thumb<00:05:32.930> and<00:05:33.930> cinch<00:05:34.650> this<00:05:34.800> together

00:05:35.450 --> 00:05:35.460 
thumb and cinch this together

00:05:35.460 --> 00:05:38.840 
thumb and cinch this together
it<00:05:36.060> is<00:05:36.210> initially<00:05:36.930> as<00:05:37.020> a<00:05:37.080> half<00:05:37.290> hitch<00:05:37.590> and<00:05:37.860> then

00:05:38.840 --> 00:05:38.850 
it is initially as a half hitch and then

00:05:38.850 --> 00:05:41.980 
it is initially as a half hitch and then
as<00:05:39.480> long<00:05:39.540> as<00:05:39.900> I<00:05:39.990> keep<00:05:40.170> the<00:05:40.230> ends<00:05:41.010> together<00:05:41.190> and

00:05:41.980 --> 00:05:41.990 
as long as I keep the ends together and

00:05:41.990 --> 00:05:45.640 
as long as I keep the ends together and
the<00:05:42.990> initial<00:05:43.380> loop<00:05:43.590> around<00:05:44.090> the<00:05:45.090> half<00:05:45.300> hitch

00:05:45.640 --> 00:05:45.650 
the initial loop around the half hitch

00:05:45.650 --> 00:05:52.520 
the initial loop around the half hitch
then<00:05:46.650> it<00:05:46.980> holds<00:05:49.220> so<00:05:50.220> like<00:05:50.400> so<00:05:50.670> okay<00:05:51.360> so<00:05:51.630> that's

00:05:52.520 --> 00:05:52.530 
then it holds so like so okay so that's

00:05:52.530 --> 00:05:54.890 
then it holds so like so okay so that's
this<00:05:52.980> is<00:05:53.040> the<00:05:53.190> main<00:05:53.700> not<00:05:53.940> that<00:05:54.150> we'll<00:05:54.300> be<00:05:54.420> using

this is the main not that we'll be using
