B as opposed to c and b because that a

00:00:42.210 --> 00:00:44.030 
B as opposed to c and b because that a
building<00:00:42.660> is<00:00:42.750> just<00:00:42.960> so<00:00:43.170> dominant<00:00:43.739> the<00:00:43.890> one

00:00:44.030 --> 00:00:44.040

00:00:49.430 --> 00:00:49.440 
lines on a B flag that it's so much more

00:00:49.440 --> 00:00:51.260

00:03:30.409 --> 00:03:30.419 
then there's another corner camper or

00:03:30.419 --> 00:03:31.909 
then there's another corner camper or
and<00:03:30.629> he<00:03:30.690> gets<00:03:30.840> rewarded<00:03:31.019> because<00:03:31.470> he<00:03:31.620> gets<00:03:31.799> a

00:03:35.069 --> 00:03:36.530 
triple spray but if you guys had noticed
when<00:03:35.190> i<00:03:35.220> got<00:03:35.430> my<00:03:35.459> first<00:03:35.760> chopper<00:03:36.239> gunner<00:03:36.419> I

00:03:36.530 --> 00:03:36.540 
when i got my first chopper gunner I

00:03:36.540 --> 00:03:38.780 
when i got my first chopper gunner I
didn't<00:03:36.870> call<00:03:37.019> my<00:03:37.169> Blackbird<00:03:37.680> in<00:03:37.829> and<00:03:38.069> I<00:03:38.459> waited

00:03:38.780 --> 00:03:38.790 
didn't call my Blackbird in and I waited

00:03:38.790 --> 00:03:40.819 
didn't call my Blackbird in and I waited
until<00:03:39.120> I<00:03:39.359> got<00:03:39.480> on<00:03:39.810> a<00:03:39.840> nice<00:03:40.109> little<00:03:40.319> streak<00:03:40.680> i

00:03:40.819 --> 00:03:40.829 
until I got on a nice little streak i

00:03:40.829 --> 00:03:43.550 
until I got on a nice little streak i
think<00:03:41.040> i<00:03:41.129> had<00:03:41.489> five<00:03:41.790> kills<00:03:42.120> in<00:03:42.359> a<00:03:42.449> row<00:03:42.480> and<00:03:42.989> then

00:03:43.550 --> 00:03:43.560 
think i had five kills in a row and then

00:03:43.560 --> 00:03:45.729 
think i had five kills in a row and then
i<00:03:43.709> called<00:03:43.949> it<00:03:44.160> in<00:03:44.280> so<00:03:44.489> that's<00:03:44.669> another<00:03:44.940> room

00:03:45.729 --> 00:03:45.739 
i called it in so that's another room

00:03:45.739 --> 00:03:48.409 
i called it in so that's another room

good idea for people out there that are

00:03:48.419 --> 00:03:50.479 
good idea for people out there that are
looking<00:03:49.199> to<00:03:49.319> try<00:03:49.500> to<00:03:49.530> get<00:03:49.769> better<00:03:49.919> and<00:03:50.250> hitting

00:03:52.909 --> 00:03:52.919 
their killstreaks if you take a chance

00:03:52.919 --> 00:03:55.250 
their killstreaks if you take a chance
it's<00:03:53.190> risky<00:03:53.639> I<00:03:53.819> mean<00:03:54.329> normally<00:03:54.480> when<00:03:54.930> i<00:03:54.959> get<00:03:55.230> my

00:04:00.120 --> 00:04:03.080 
but from time to time if I feel like I'm
in<00:04:00.629> a<00:04:00.750> good<00:04:00.900> position<00:04:01.079> or<00:04:01.859> I'm<00:04:02.280> not<00:04:02.459> surrounded

after i get my dogs in my chopper then
i'll<00:04:07.799> have<00:04:07.919> the<00:04:08.099> Blackbird<00:04:08.549> kind<00:04:08.790> of<00:04:08.910> waiting

i'll have the Blackbird kind of waiting

00:04:09.299 --> 00:04:12.830 
i'll have the Blackbird kind of waiting
and<00:04:09.980> sometimes<00:04:10.980> you<00:04:11.220> know<00:04:11.340> i'm<00:04:12.000> just<00:04:12.299> guilty

00:04:12.830 --> 00:04:12.840 
and sometimes you know i'm just guilty

00:04:12.840 --> 00:04:14.569 
and sometimes you know i'm just guilty
of<00:04:12.959> just<00:04:13.169> calling<00:04:13.650> it<00:04:13.889> in<00:04:14.040> right<00:04:14.280> away<00:04:14.430> but

00:04:14.569 --> 00:04:14.579 
of just calling it in right away but

00:04:14.579 --> 00:04:16.400 
of just calling it in right away but
that's<00:04:14.879> not<00:04:15.030> smart<00:04:15.449> i<00:04:15.660> think<00:04:15.840> it's<00:04:15.989> better<00:04:16.169> to

00:04:16.400 --> 00:04:16.410 
that's not smart i think it's better to

00:04:16.410 --> 00:04:18.439 
that's not smart i think it's better to
just<00:04:16.590> kind<00:04:16.889> of<00:04:16.979> hold<00:04:17.459> onto<00:04:17.699> it<00:04:18.030> for<00:04:18.209> a<00:04:18.239> minute

00:04:18.439 --> 00:04:18.449 
just kind of hold onto it for a minute

00:04:18.449 --> 00:04:20.930 
just kind of hold onto it for a minute
and<00:04:18.690> get<00:04:19.470> into<00:04:19.650> a<00:04:19.739> nice<00:04:19.979> area<00:04:20.370> or<00:04:20.609> nice

00:04:20.930 --> 00:04:20.940 
and get into a nice area or nice

00:04:20.940 --> 00:04:23.149 
and get into a nice area or nice
position<00:04:21.269> get<00:04:22.140> a<00:04:22.169> nice<00:04:22.380> little<00:04:22.560> streak<00:04:22.950> going

00:04:23.149 --> 00:04:23.159 
position get a nice little streak going

00:04:23.159 --> 00:04:25.120 
position get a nice little streak going
and<00:04:23.460> then<00:04:23.640> called<00:04:23.940> in<00:04:24.150> because

00:04:25.120 --> 00:04:25.130 
and then called in because

00:04:25.130 --> 00:04:26.809 
and then called in because
then<00:04:26.130> you're<00:04:26.280> going<00:04:26.370> to<00:04:26.430> know<00:04:26.610> where

00:04:26.809 --> 00:04:26.819 
then you're going to know where

00:04:26.819 --> 00:04:28.100 
then you're going to know where
everybody<00:04:27.090> is<00:04:27.330> and<00:04:27.720> it's<00:04:27.840> a<00:04:27.900> lot<00:04:28.080> easier

00:04:28.100 --> 00:04:28.110 
everybody is and it's a lot easier

00:04:28.110 --> 00:04:30.980 
everybody is and it's a lot easier
easier<00:04:28.710> to<00:04:29.130> consistently<00:04:29.699> chain<00:04:30.330> killstreaks

00:04:30.980 --> 00:04:30.990 
easier to consistently chain killstreaks

00:04:30.990 --> 00:04:33.980 
easier to consistently chain killstreaks
together<00:04:31.349> that<00:04:31.650> way<00:04:32.180> so<00:04:33.180> I<00:04:33.210> was<00:04:33.449> talking<00:04:33.780> about
