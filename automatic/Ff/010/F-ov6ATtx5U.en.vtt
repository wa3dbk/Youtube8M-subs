00:00:39.540 --> 00:00:41.920 
you're starting to see that I can bend
all<00:00:39.750> car<00:00:40.079> parts<00:00:40.620> of<00:00:40.770> the<00:00:40.860> articulated<00:00:41.430> body

00:00:41.920 --> 00:00:41.930 
all car parts of the articulated body

00:00:41.930 --> 00:00:46.520 
all car parts of the articulated body
using<00:00:42.930> these<00:00:43.020> faders<00:00:43.320> and<00:00:43.710> set<00:00:44.250> up<00:00:44.370> pose<00:00:45.530> now

00:00:46.520 --> 00:00:46.530 
using these faders and set up pose now

00:00:46.530 --> 00:00:48.740 
using these faders and set up pose now
in<00:00:46.829> one<00:00:47.070> sense<00:00:47.309> this<00:00:47.489> is<00:00:47.550> just<00:00:47.850> the<00:00:47.969> same<00:00:48.180> as<00:00:48.420> as

00:00:48.740 --> 00:00:48.750 
in one sense this is just the same as as

00:00:48.750 --> 00:00:51.080 
in one sense this is just the same as as
a<00:00:49.110> slider<00:00:49.829> box<00:00:50.129> or<00:00:50.340> the<00:00:50.370> thumb<00:00:50.610> meals<00:00:50.850> that<00:00:50.969> you

00:00:51.080 --> 00:00:51.090 
a slider box or the thumb meals that you

00:00:51.090 --> 00:00:53.389 
a slider box or the thumb meals that you
find<00:00:51.329> on<00:00:51.449> many<00:00:51.690> graphics<00:00:52.469> workstations<00:00:53.070> the

00:00:53.389 --> 00:00:53.399 
find on many graphics workstations the

00:00:53.399 --> 00:00:55.549 
find on many graphics workstations the
point<00:00:53.850> we<00:00:54.120> made<00:00:54.360> here<00:00:54.629> is<00:00:54.840> that<00:00:54.899> meeting<00:00:55.320> as

00:00:55.549 --> 00:00:55.559 
point we made here is that meeting as

00:00:55.559 --> 00:00:57.080 
point we made here is that meeting as
MIDI<00:00:55.800> as<00:00:55.949> MIDI<00:00:56.219> and<00:00:56.430> it<00:00:56.579> doesn't<00:00:56.910> matter

00:00:57.080 --> 00:00:57.090 
MIDI as MIDI and it doesn't matter

00:00:57.090 --> 00:00:59.840 
MIDI as MIDI and it doesn't matter
whether<00:00:57.329> this<00:00:57.539> is<00:00:57.600> a<00:00:57.719> drum<00:00:58.199> a<00:00:58.500> saxophone<00:00:59.370> or<00:00:59.640> a

00:00:59.840 --> 00:00:59.850 
whether this is a drum a saxophone or a

00:00:59.850 --> 00:01:02.330 
whether this is a drum a saxophone or a
keyboard<00:01:00.840> or<00:01:00.989> any<00:01:01.260> MIDI<00:01:01.649> device<00:01:02.010> you<00:01:02.219> can

00:01:02.330 --> 00:01:02.340 
keyboard or any MIDI device you can

00:01:02.340 --> 00:01:04.399 
keyboard or any MIDI device you can
imagine<00:01:02.640> you<00:01:03.239> can<00:01:03.420> use<00:01:03.660> it<00:01:03.690> to<00:01:03.930> control<00:01:04.080> your

00:01:04.399 --> 00:01:04.409 
imagine you can use it to control your

00:01:04.409 --> 00:01:06.080 
imagine you can use it to control your
figure<00:01:04.799> they're<00:01:05.129> cheap<00:01:05.460> they're<00:01:05.670> available

00:01:06.080 --> 00:01:06.090 
figure they're cheap they're available

00:01:06.090 --> 00:01:08.240 
figure they're cheap they're available
everywhere<00:01:06.510> and<00:01:06.869> you<00:01:07.560> can<00:01:07.710> tailor<00:01:08.100> the

00:01:08.240 --> 00:01:08.250 
everywhere and you can tailor the

00:01:08.250 --> 00:01:10.010 
everywhere and you can tailor the
controls<00:01:08.850> to<00:01:09.030> match<00:01:09.360> whatever<00:01:09.720> you're

00:01:10.010 --> 00:01:10.020 
controls to match whatever you're

00:01:10.020 --> 00:01:12.920 
controls to match whatever you're
animating<00:01:10.290> so<00:01:11.280> we've<00:01:11.729> got<00:01:11.970> this<00:01:12.210> great<00:01:12.600> pose

00:01:12.920 --> 00:01:12.930 
animating so we've got this great pose

00:01:12.930 --> 00:01:14.690 
animating so we've got this great pose
right<00:01:13.260> now<00:01:13.470> so<00:01:13.740> what<00:01:13.920> I'm<00:01:14.010> going<00:01:14.250> to<00:01:14.310> do<00:01:14.490> is

00:01:14.690 --> 00:01:14.700 
right now so what I'm going to do is

00:01:14.700 --> 00:01:16.550 
right now so what I'm going to do is
simply<00:01:15.090> hit<00:01:15.479> the<00:01:15.509> red<00:01:15.810> button<00:01:16.020> here<00:01:16.470> and

00:01:16.550 --> 00:01:16.560 
simply hit the red button here and

00:01:16.560 --> 00:01:18.410 
simply hit the red button here and
that's<00:01:16.920> to<00:01:17.310> record<00:01:17.700> it<00:01:17.820> and<00:01:17.970> that's<00:01:18.180> all<00:01:18.390> I

00:01:18.410 --> 00:01:18.420 
that's to record it and that's all I

00:01:18.420 --> 00:01:20.870 
that's to record it and that's all I
need<00:01:18.600> to<00:01:18.630> do<00:01:18.869> and<00:01:19.110> scrub<00:01:19.799> along<00:01:20.100> in<00:01:20.280> time<00:01:20.310> and

00:01:20.870 --> 00:01:20.880 
need to do and scrub along in time and

00:01:20.880 --> 00:01:22.999 
need to do and scrub along in time and
so<00:01:21.119> up<00:01:21.299> on<00:01:21.450> the<00:01:21.509> top<00:01:21.689> of<00:01:21.840> the<00:01:21.930> screen<00:01:22.170> if<00:01:22.920> you

00:01:22.999 --> 00:01:23.009 
so up on the top of the screen if you

00:01:23.009 --> 00:01:24.950 
so up on the top of the screen if you
look<00:01:23.159> up<00:01:23.310> here<00:01:23.369> you<00:01:23.549> can<00:01:23.670> see<00:01:24.030> the<00:01:24.270> time<00:01:24.659> slider

00:01:24.950 --> 00:01:24.960 
look up here you can see the time slider

00:01:24.960 --> 00:01:27.080 
look up here you can see the time slider
is<00:01:25.170> now<00:01:25.350> moved<00:01:25.560> up<00:01:25.740> to<00:01:26.250> let's<00:01:26.580> make<00:01:26.880> it<00:01:27.000> to

00:01:27.080 --> 00:01:27.090 
is now moved up to let's make it to

00:01:27.090 --> 00:01:29.780 
is now moved up to let's make it to
frame<00:01:27.720> 20<00:01:28.140> now<00:01:28.829> at<00:01:28.920> that<00:01:28.979> point<00:01:29.100> I'm<00:01:29.579> going<00:01:29.700> to

00:01:29.780 --> 00:01:29.790 
frame 20 now at that point I'm going to

00:01:29.790 --> 00:01:33.020 
frame 20 now at that point I'm going to
change<00:01:30.119> the<00:01:30.329> pose<00:01:30.799> then<00:01:31.799> back<00:01:32.130> and<00:01:32.400> record<00:01:32.909> it

00:01:33.020 --> 00:01:33.030 
change the pose then back and record it

00:01:33.030 --> 00:01:35.300 
change the pose then back and record it
now<00:01:33.450> already<00:01:33.900> if<00:01:34.079> I<00:01:34.170> scrub<00:01:34.470> backwards<00:01:34.979> you<00:01:35.130> can

00:01:35.300 --> 00:01:35.310 
now already if I scrub backwards you can

00:01:35.310 --> 00:01:37.640 
now already if I scrub backwards you can
see<00:01:35.579> that<00:01:35.820> it's<00:01:36.329> automatically<00:01:37.049> interpolated

00:01:37.640 --> 00:01:37.650 
see that it's automatically interpolated

00:01:37.650 --> 00:01:39.980 
see that it's automatically interpolated
in<00:01:37.860> between<00:01:38.220> those<00:01:38.400> two<00:01:38.670> keyframes<00:01:39.240> all<00:01:39.930> I

00:01:39.980 --> 00:01:39.990 
in between those two keyframes all I

00:01:39.990 --> 00:01:42.170 
in between those two keyframes all I
needed<00:01:40.409> to<00:01:40.530> do<00:01:40.740> to<00:01:40.860> set<00:01:41.040> a<00:01:41.070> keyframe<00:01:41.310> just<00:01:42.000> hit

00:01:42.170 --> 00:01:42.180 
needed to do to set a keyframe just hit

00:01:42.180 --> 00:01:44.510 
needed to do to set a keyframe just hit
the<00:01:42.270> red<00:01:42.450> button<00:01:42.630> free<00:01:42.960> court<00:01:43.229> now<00:01:43.979> again<00:01:44.310> I'll

00:01:44.510 --> 00:01:44.520 
the red button free court now again I'll

00:01:44.520 --> 00:01:49.370 
the red button free court now again I'll
change<00:01:45.000> the<00:01:45.210> pose<00:01:45.450> and<00:01:47.119> down<00:01:48.119> record<00:01:48.720> and<00:01:48.990> move

00:01:49.370 --> 00:01:49.380 
change the pose and down record and move

00:01:49.380 --> 00:01:52.069 
change the pose and down record and move

that is the basis of all of our work to

00:02:46.140 --> 00:02:48.500 
that is the basis of all of our work to
