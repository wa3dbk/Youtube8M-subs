00:00:07.280 --> 00:00:12.540
 Welcome to the press conference 

00:00:09.570 --> 00:00:13.889
 after the party first fc kaiserslautern 

00:00:12.540 --> 00:00:15.120
 against the fc energy cottbus yourself 

00:00:13.889 --> 00:00:16.350
 of course welcome the opponent 

00:00:15.120 --> 00:00:18.900
 coach Rudolf Bommer and our 

00:00:16.350 --> 00:00:22.289
 Chef Oliver Schaefer wants to change 

00:00:18.900 --> 00:00:24.600
 I want his commentary on the game 

00:00:22.289 --> 00:00:26.099
 I found it for Monday play 

00:00:24.600 --> 00:00:28.260
 really really cool game I have to 

00:00:26.099 --> 00:00:30.869
 quite honestly, say it right with a tempo 

00:00:28.260 --> 00:00:33.899
 Everything in it was emotional opportunities 

00:00:30.869 --> 00:00:37.219
 spielwitz and therefore I have to first 

00:00:33.899 --> 00:00:37.219
 to compliment both teams 

00:00:37.579 --> 00:00:43.680
 But I think that if we do it twice 

00:00:40.940 --> 00:00:45.239
 Out of town that you just then too 

00:00:43.680 --> 00:00:46.530
 that must hold on there I am easy 

00:00:45.239 --> 00:00:50.010
 not so happy I am completely honest 

00:00:46.530 --> 00:00:51.360
 and we have some things there too 

00:00:50.010 --> 00:00:53.969
 correct that you are just too open 

00:00:51.360 --> 00:00:56.489
 from our way of playing but me 

00:00:53.969 --> 00:00:58.320
 Think of both sides and I like it 

00:00:56.489 --> 00:00:59.789
 just a bit shorter because I want 

00:00:58.320 --> 00:01:03.000
 also home because I am tomorrow morning 

00:00:59.789 --> 00:01:05.970
 from the 7 8 clock I think of the 

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:07.380
 chances to draw that 

00:01:05.970 --> 00:01:07.970
 then ultimately meet 

00:01:07.380 --> 00:01:10.290
 Thank you very much 

00:01:07.970 --> 00:01:13.290
 thank you rudi bommer because the shepherds 

00:01:10.290 --> 00:01:15.030
 in a comment please well the 

00:01:13.290 --> 00:01:16.520
 played ball namely like to be short 

00:01:15.030 --> 00:01:18.630
 on 

00:01:16.520 --> 00:01:20.700
 I can only stress that it is 

00:01:18.630 --> 00:01:21.619
 really the game was what we were 

00:01:20.700 --> 00:01:25.259
 have made 

00:01:21.619 --> 00:01:27.990
 Pure passion that the bude 

00:01:25.259 --> 00:01:29.430
 here really burns and as I said 

00:01:27.990 --> 00:01:31.619
 when you go home, of course, twice 

00:01:29.430 --> 00:01:32.909
 lie back and still come back 

00:01:31.619 --> 00:01:35.369
 even though he is still ten years old 

00:01:32.909 --> 00:01:36.930
 I have to stand in the square 

00:01:35.369 --> 00:01:39.689
 whole troop and a big praise 

00:01:36.930 --> 00:01:42.540
 Yes, that's what they often say today 

00:01:39.689 --> 00:01:45.240
 was outstanding in the 

00:01:42.540 --> 00:01:47.220
 In the end, you are always happy when you are 

00:01:45.240 --> 00:01:49.520
 if there is a curve like that, there are three points 

00:01:47.220 --> 00:01:51.600
 unfortunately we only have one 

00:01:49.520 --> 00:01:53.399
 anyway, I think this feels 

00:01:51.600 --> 00:01:56.159
 point today as a victory for us 

00:01:53.399 --> 00:01:57.780
 above all things because we also have one 

00:01:56.159 --> 00:02:00.299
 have been criticized a bit what the 

00:01:57.780 --> 00:02:01.560
 attitude I believe today 

00:02:00.299 --> 00:02:04.320
 we showed that we are different too 

00:02:01.560 --> 00:02:06.509
 can and i enjoyed the game 

00:02:04.320 --> 00:02:09.140
 and I'm finally with the point more 

00:02:06.509 --> 00:02:09.140
 as satisfied
