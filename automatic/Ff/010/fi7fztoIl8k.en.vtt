00:01:18.620 --> 00:01:18.630 
layer and this is a soak off gel think

00:01:18.630 --> 00:01:21.499 
layer and this is a soak off gel think
of<00:01:18.750> clear<00:01:19.049> gel<00:01:19.080> as<00:01:19.470> base<00:01:19.830> gel<00:01:20.100> base<00:01:20.939> gel<00:01:21.240> and

I'm not actually pressing down on the

00:01:31.470 --> 00:01:33.530 
I'm not actually pressing down on the
bristles<00:01:31.950> what<00:01:32.340> I'm<00:01:32.430> doing<00:01:32.759> is<00:01:32.909> I'm<00:01:33.060> floating

00:01:33.530 --> 00:01:33.540 
bristles what I'm doing is I'm floating

00:01:33.540 --> 00:01:35.330 
bristles what I'm doing is I'm floating
over<00:01:33.840> the<00:01:33.869> nail<00:01:34.140> because<00:01:34.680> I<00:01:34.770> want<00:01:34.950> to<00:01:35.009> create

00:01:35.330 --> 00:01:35.340 
over the nail because I want to create

00:01:35.340 --> 00:01:37.640 
over the nail because I want to create
some<00:01:35.759> thickness<00:01:36.000> if<00:01:36.540> you<00:01:36.810> press<00:01:37.020> down<00:01:37.290> you're

00:01:37.640 --> 00:01:37.650 
some thickness if you press down you're

00:01:37.650 --> 00:01:39.620 
some thickness if you press down you're
going<00:01:37.740> to<00:01:37.829> thin<00:01:38.040> it<00:01:38.070> out<00:01:38.310> so<00:01:38.670> instead<00:01:39.060> hover

00:01:39.620 --> 00:01:39.630 
going to thin it out so instead hover

00:01:39.630 --> 00:01:41.929 
going to thin it out so instead hover
over<00:01:40.140> top<00:01:40.380> and<00:01:40.650> the<00:01:40.799> gel<00:01:41.040> will<00:01:41.250> fall<00:01:41.430> then

00:01:41.929 --> 00:01:41.939 
over top and the gel will fall then

00:01:41.939 --> 00:01:43.580 
over top and the gel will fall then
without<00:01:42.270> curing<00:01:42.810> I'm<00:01:43.020> going<00:01:43.229> to<00:01:43.290> apply<00:01:43.470> the

00:01:43.580 --> 00:01:43.590

silk to the wet gel you want the gel to

00:01:45.960 --> 00:01:48.020 
silk to the wet gel you want the gel to
saturate<00:01:46.530> the<00:01:46.560> entire<00:01:46.680> silk<00:01:47.399> wrap<00:01:47.579> so<00:01:47.909> I'm

cut<00:01:51.360> on<00:01:51.450> the<00:01:51.570> bias<00:01:51.720> it's<00:01:52.259> going<00:01:52.500> to<00:01:52.560> form<00:01:52.799> to

00:01:52.969 --> 00:01:52.979 
cut on the bias it's going to form to

00:01:52.979 --> 00:01:54.250

if you're familiar with fabric and

00:01:55.760 --> 00:01:57.070 
if you're familiar with fabric and
leaving<00:01:56.119> then<00:01:56.330> you<00:01:56.450> know<00:01:56.540> what<00:01:56.659> I'm<00:01:56.750> talking

00:01:57.070 --> 00:01:57.080

leaving then you know what I'm talking
about<00:01:57.170> but<00:01:57.500> if<00:01:57.590> not<00:01:57.740> don't<00:01:58.070> worry<00:01:58.190> about<00:01:58.490> it

00:01:58.630 --> 00:01:58.640 
about but if not don't worry about it

00:01:58.640 --> 00:02:00.160 
about but if not don't worry about it
it's<00:01:58.850> not<00:01:58.970> really<00:01:59.030> that<00:01:59.390> important<00:01:59.810> then

00:02:00.160 --> 00:02:00.170 
it's not really that important then

00:02:00.170 --> 00:02:01.780 
it's not really that important then
after<00:02:00.560> you<00:02:00.680> cure<00:02:00.950> you<00:02:01.250> can<00:02:01.400> trim<00:02:01.580> away<00:02:01.670> the

00:02:01.780 --> 00:02:01.790 
after you cure you can trim away the

00:02:01.790 --> 00:02:03.640 
after you cure you can trim away the
excess<00:02:01.940> and<00:02:02.420> it<00:02:02.720> doesn't<00:02:02.930> have<00:02:03.020> to<00:02:03.140> be<00:02:03.229> perfect

00:02:03.640 --> 00:02:03.650 
excess and it doesn't have to be perfect

00:02:03.650 --> 00:02:05.710 
excess and it doesn't have to be perfect
because<00:02:03.799> you<00:02:04.070> will<00:02:04.250> chew<00:02:04.430> it<00:02:04.580> up<00:02:04.640> later<00:02:04.850> so<00:02:05.630> now

00:02:14.680 --> 00:02:14.690 
using that floating technique I'm just

00:02:14.690 --> 00:02:16.270 
using that floating technique I'm just
hovering<00:02:15.230> and<00:02:15.530> letting<00:02:15.739> the<00:02:15.860> gel<00:02:16.100> make

contact with the veil then pulling down
very<00:02:18.319> gently<00:02:18.680> just<00:02:18.770> smooth<00:02:19.400> and<00:02:19.610> get<00:02:19.850> rid<00:02:19.970> of

00:02:19.990 --> 00:02:20.000 
very gently just smooth and get rid of

00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:22.390 
very gently just smooth and get rid of
any<00:02:20.180> brushstrokes<00:02:20.739> notice<00:02:21.739> how<00:02:21.860> my<00:02:22.010> bristles

any brushstrokes notice how my bristles
barely<00:02:22.970> move<00:02:23.150> so<00:02:23.930> after<00:02:24.170> I<00:02:24.230> cure<00:02:24.410> that<00:02:24.560> layer

00:02:24.729 --> 00:02:24.739 
barely move so after I cure that layer

00:02:24.739 --> 00:02:26.740

that's the only place that I'm pressing

00:02:33.709 --> 00:02:35.770 
that's the only place that I'm pressing
really<00:02:34.130> hard<00:02:34.250> because<00:02:34.850> I<00:02:35.000> want<00:02:35.239> to<00:02:35.269> thin<00:02:35.660> the

00:02:52.900 --> 00:02:52.910 
remember there's an inhibition layer

00:02:52.910 --> 00:02:55.000 
remember there's an inhibition layer
that's<00:02:53.209> left<00:02:53.510> after<00:02:53.900> you<00:02:53.930> cure<00:02:54.290> your<00:02:54.440> gel<00:02:54.709> so

00:02:55.000 --> 00:02:55.010 
that's left after you cure your gel so

00:02:55.010 --> 00:02:56.320 
that's left after you cure your gel so

00:03:00.130 --> 00:03:00.140 
I begin by going gently around the

00:03:00.140 --> 00:03:01.990 
I begin by going gently around the
cuticle<00:03:00.560> remember<00:03:01.160> you<00:03:01.310> don't<00:03:01.549> have<00:03:01.670> to<00:03:01.820> file

00:03:01.990 --> 00:03:02.000 
cuticle remember you don't have to file

00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:03.490 
cuticle remember you don't have to file
very<00:03:02.269> much<00:03:02.450> in<00:03:02.600> this<00:03:02.660> area<00:03:02.720> because<00:03:03.410> you

00:03:03.490 --> 00:03:03.500 
very much in this area because you

00:03:03.500 --> 00:03:04.840 
very much in this area because you
didn't<00:03:03.739> put<00:03:03.890> very<00:03:04.130> much<00:03:04.190> product<00:03:04.640> there<00:03:04.730> to

00:03:04.840 --> 00:03:04.850 
didn't put very much product there to

00:03:04.850 --> 00:03:06.670 
didn't put very much product there to
begin<00:03:04.970> with<00:03:05.090> because<00:03:05.720> the<00:03:06.019> grit<00:03:06.230> is<00:03:06.350> quite

00:03:06.670 --> 00:03:06.680 
begin with because the grit is quite

00:03:06.680 --> 00:03:09.039 
begin with because the grit is quite
high<00:03:06.890> you<00:03:07.250> only<00:03:07.430> need<00:03:07.700> a<00:03:07.910> few<00:03:07.940> strokes<00:03:08.360> once

00:03:09.039 --> 00:03:09.049 
high you only need a few strokes once

00:03:09.049 --> 00:03:10.720 
high you only need a few strokes once
I'm<00:03:09.200> done<00:03:09.380> I<00:03:09.620> followed<00:03:09.980> that<00:03:10.130> curve<00:03:10.400> up<00:03:10.610> the

00:03:10.720 --> 00:03:10.730 
I'm done I followed that curve up the

00:03:10.730 --> 00:03:12.819 
I'm done I followed that curve up the
sides<00:03:10.970> of<00:03:11.180> the<00:03:11.269> nail<00:03:11.420> then<00:03:11.690> I<00:03:12.019> move<00:03:12.290> to<00:03:12.440> the<00:03:12.590> tip

00:03:12.819 --> 00:03:12.829 
sides of the nail then I move to the tip

00:03:12.829 --> 00:03:15.009 
sides of the nail then I move to the tip
you<00:03:13.070> guys<00:03:13.250> can<00:03:13.459> see<00:03:13.640> that<00:03:13.880> I'm<00:03:14.030> doing<00:03:14.060> strokes

00:03:15.019 --> 00:03:16.930 
you guys can see that I'm doing strokes
going<00:03:15.350> down<00:03:15.739> towards<00:03:16.190> the<00:03:16.280> tip<00:03:16.459> because<00:03:16.760> I'm

00:03:16.930 --> 00:03:16.940 
going down towards the tip because I'm

00:03:16.940 --> 00:03:18.910 
going down towards the tip because I'm
thinning<00:03:17.269> it<00:03:17.390> out<00:03:17.480> remember<00:03:18.470> that<00:03:18.650> you<00:03:18.769> need

00:03:18.910 --> 00:03:18.920 
thinning it out remember that you need

00:03:18.920 --> 00:03:20.500 
thinning it out remember that you need
the<00:03:19.070> least<00:03:19.340> amount<00:03:19.579> of<00:03:19.730> product<00:03:20.090> around<00:03:20.420> the

00:03:20.500 --> 00:03:20.510 
the least amount of product around the

00:03:20.510 --> 00:03:22.090 
the least amount of product around the
cuticle<00:03:20.959> and<00:03:21.079> the<00:03:21.350> tip<00:03:21.560> for<00:03:21.829> it<00:03:21.920> to<00:03:21.980> look

00:03:22.090 --> 00:03:22.100 
cuticle and the tip for it to look

00:03:22.100 --> 00:03:23.920 
cuticle and the tip for it to look
natural<00:03:22.250> and<00:03:22.670> then<00:03:23.090> I<00:03:23.150> just<00:03:23.329> blend<00:03:23.480> the<00:03:23.690> middle

00:03:23.920 --> 00:03:23.930 
natural and then I just blend the middle

00:03:23.930 --> 00:03:25.000 
natural and then I just blend the middle
portion<00:03:24.109> that's<00:03:24.470> the<00:03:24.560> left<00:03:24.739> which<00:03:24.859> is<00:03:24.980> the

00:03:25.000 --> 00:03:25.010 
portion that's the left which is the

00:03:25.010 --> 00:03:27.949 
portion that's the left which is the
apex<00:03:25.519> and<00:03:25.730> the<00:03:26.060> highest<00:03:26.480> point<00:03:26.720> of<00:03:26.870> the<00:03:26.959> new

00:03:27.949 --> 00:03:27.959
