00:00:15.750 --> 00:00:18.590 
have been having some mic issues and
that's<00:00:16.529> mainly<00:00:16.859> because<00:00:17.010> i<00:00:17.340> had<00:00:17.609> my<00:00:18.029> headset

00:00:18.590 --> 00:00:18.600 
that's mainly because i had my headset

00:00:18.600 --> 00:00:21.560 
that's mainly because i had my headset
on<00:00:18.779> a<00:00:18.810> little<00:00:19.320> bit<00:00:19.439> too<00:00:19.710> loose<00:00:20.119> so<00:00:21.119> basically

00:00:21.560 --> 00:00:21.570 
on a little bit too loose so basically

00:00:21.570 --> 00:00:24.519 
on a little bit too loose so basically
what<00:00:21.900> happens<00:00:22.320> whenever<00:00:22.529> my<00:00:22.890> mic<00:00:23.519> makes<00:00:23.910> um

00:00:24.519 --> 00:00:24.529 
what happens whenever my mic makes um

00:00:24.529 --> 00:00:28.220 
what happens whenever my mic makes um
crackling<00:00:25.529> noises<00:00:25.740> it's<00:00:26.670> mainly<00:00:27.000> due<00:00:27.390> to<00:00:27.420> uh

00:00:28.220 --> 00:00:28.230 
crackling noises it's mainly due to uh

00:00:28.230 --> 00:00:30.890 
crackling noises it's mainly due to uh
my<00:00:28.890> mic<00:00:29.160> moving<00:00:29.640> around<00:00:29.880> as<00:00:30.179> i<00:00:30.300> talk<00:00:30.539> which

00:00:30.890 --> 00:00:30.900 
my mic moving around as i talk which

00:00:30.900 --> 00:00:33.709 
my mic moving around as i talk which
makes<00:00:31.199> those<00:00:31.470> noises<00:00:31.920> so<00:00:32.669> basically<00:00:33.510> what<00:00:33.690> I

00:00:33.709 --> 00:00:33.719 
makes those noises so basically what I

00:00:33.719 --> 00:00:35.600 
makes those noises so basically what I
did<00:00:33.809> was<00:00:34.050> adjust<00:00:34.410> my<00:00:34.530> headset<00:00:35.040> a<00:00:35.250> little

00:00:35.600 --> 00:00:35.610 
did was adjust my headset a little

00:00:35.610 --> 00:00:38.270 
did was adjust my headset a little
tighter<00:00:35.850> and<00:00:36.210> I<00:00:36.750> think<00:00:36.989> this<00:00:37.079> will<00:00:37.260> work<00:00:37.620> a<00:00:38.129> bit

00:00:38.270 --> 00:00:38.280 
tighter and I think this will work a bit

00:00:38.280 --> 00:00:42.830 
tighter and I think this will work a bit
better<00:00:39.140> now<00:00:40.140> that<00:00:40.590> um<00:00:41.040> i<00:00:41.820> discovered<00:00:42.719> the

00:00:42.830 --> 00:00:42.840 
better now that um i discovered the

00:00:42.840 --> 00:00:45.229 
better now that um i discovered the
method<00:00:43.489> you<00:00:44.489> know<00:00:44.550> it's<00:00:44.730> just<00:00:44.789> the<00:00:44.969> way<00:00:45.180> you
