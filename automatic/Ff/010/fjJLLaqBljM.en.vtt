put two joints together to form a lap
joint<00:01:17.180> which<00:01:18.180> goes<00:01:18.450> together<00:01:18.720> like<00:01:19.280> then<00:01:20.280> that

00:01:21.700 --> 00:01:21.710 
joint which goes together like then that

00:01:21.710 --> 00:01:26.570 
joint which goes together like then that
is<00:01:22.710> a<00:01:22.890> successful<00:01:23.790> that<00:01:24.119> joint<00:01:24.420> so<00:01:24.900> I<00:01:25.250> have<00:01:26.250> all

00:01:26.570 --> 00:01:26.580 
is a successful that joint so I have all

00:01:26.580 --> 00:01:28.789 
is a successful that joint so I have all
of<00:01:26.700> these<00:01:26.790> put<00:01:27.180> together<00:01:27.330> in<00:01:28.080> this<00:01:28.350> way<00:01:28.560> it's

part that I want to put on the bar just
to<00:02:43.560> kind<00:02:43.799> of<00:02:43.860> so<00:02:44.730> you<00:02:44.790> can<00:02:45.030> kind<00:02:45.239> of<00:02:45.299> see<00:02:45.739> how

00:02:47.199 --> 00:02:47.209 
to kind of so you can kind of see how

00:02:47.209 --> 00:02:49.940 
to kind of so you can kind of see how
wide<00:02:48.209> the<00:02:48.540> bar<00:02:48.780> will<00:02:48.959> be<00:02:49.110> in<00:02:49.260> comparison<00:02:49.920> to

00:02:49.940 --> 00:02:49.950 
wide the bar will be in comparison to

00:02:49.950 --> 00:02:52.190 
wide the bar will be in comparison to
the<00:02:50.310> frame<00:02:50.610> it's<00:02:51.150> not<00:02:51.299> really<00:02:51.630> much<00:02:51.780> it's<00:02:52.140> not

00:02:52.190 --> 00:02:52.200 
the frame it's not really much it's not

00:02:52.200 --> 00:02:55.970 
the frame it's not really much it's not
really<00:02:52.470> that<00:02:52.709> much<00:02:52.950> wider<00:02:53.750> once<00:02:54.750> I<00:02:54.840> put<00:02:55.080> this

00:02:55.970 --> 00:02:55.980 
really that much wider once I put this

00:02:55.980 --> 00:02:58.970 
really that much wider once I put this
on<00:02:56.549> to<00:02:57.209> the<00:02:57.390> base<00:02:57.630> which<00:02:58.200> is<00:02:58.319> gonna<00:02:58.470> be<00:02:58.560> made<00:02:58.830> of

00:02:58.970 --> 00:02:58.980 
on to the base which is gonna be made of

00:02:58.980 --> 00:03:04.000 
on to the base which is gonna be made of
plywood<00:02:59.660> I'll<00:03:00.950> be<00:03:01.950> able<00:03:02.040> to<00:03:02.220> do<00:03:02.459> that<00:03:02.730> I<00:03:02.970> found

somebody didn't want and I'm building
this<00:03:19.980> just<00:03:20.190> for<00:03:20.549> pretty<00:03:20.790> much<00:03:20.940> free<00:03:21.739> okay<00:03:22.739> this

one<00:03:23.250> here<00:03:23.549> and<00:03:23.970> I<00:03:24.239> got<00:03:24.390> one<00:03:24.799> up<00:03:25.799> there<00:03:26.220> on<00:03:26.640> the

00:03:26.809 --> 00:03:26.819 
one here and I got one up there on the

00:03:26.819 --> 00:03:30.289 
one here and I got one up there on the
workbench<00:03:27.709> yeah<00:03:28.709> I'm<00:03:29.069> not<00:03:29.310> sure<00:03:29.340> exactly<00:03:29.940> what

00:03:30.289 --> 00:03:30.299 
workbench yeah I'm not sure exactly what

00:03:30.299 --> 00:03:32.449 
workbench yeah I'm not sure exactly what
I'm<00:03:30.420> gonna<00:03:30.540> do<00:03:30.810> with<00:03:31.019> ya<00:03:31.290> but<00:03:31.560> I<00:03:31.980> was<00:03:32.160> kind<00:03:32.400> of

00:03:32.449 --> 00:03:32.459 
I'm gonna do with ya but I was kind of

00:03:32.459 --> 00:03:37.099 
I'm gonna do with ya but I was kind of
thinking<00:03:32.609> about<00:03:33.000> using<00:03:33.299> it<00:03:33.569> as<00:03:33.799> like<00:03:34.799> a<00:03:36.109> foot

00:03:37.099 --> 00:03:37.109 
thinking about using it as like a foot

00:03:37.109 --> 00:03:39.490 
thinking about using it as like a foot
rest<00:03:37.950> so<00:03:38.310> when<00:03:38.519> you're<00:03:38.700> sitting<00:03:39.000> at<00:03:39.150> the<00:03:39.269> bar

00:03:39.490 --> 00:03:39.500 
rest so when you're sitting at the bar

00:03:39.500 --> 00:03:42.949 
rest so when you're sitting at the bar
you'll<00:03:40.500> put<00:03:40.650> your<00:03:40.769> feet<00:03:40.980> on<00:03:41.010> there<00:03:41.340> and<00:03:41.959> for

00:03:42.949 --> 00:03:42.959 
you'll put your feet on there and for

00:03:42.959 --> 00:03:45.910 
you'll put your feet on there and for
the<00:03:43.019> most<00:03:43.200> part<00:03:43.530> I<00:03:43.920> think<00:03:44.519> it<00:03:44.639> would<00:03:44.730> be<00:03:44.850> pretty

00:03:45.910 --> 00:03:45.920 
the most part I think it would be pretty

00:03:45.920 --> 00:03:51.379 
the most part I think it would be pretty
long<00:03:48.590> enough<00:03:49.590> to<00:03:50.280> go<00:03:50.459> right<00:03:50.670> along<00:03:50.819> the<00:03:51.180> edge

00:03:51.379 --> 00:03:51.389 
long enough to go right along the edge

00:03:51.389 --> 00:03:53.720 
long enough to go right along the edge
of<00:03:51.780> this<00:03:52.319> especially<00:03:52.889> if<00:03:52.950> I<00:03:53.040> do<00:03:53.100> it<00:03:53.340> like<00:03:53.489> that

00:03:53.720 --> 00:03:53.730 
of this especially if I do it like that

00:03:53.730 --> 00:03:54.550 
of this especially if I do it like that
so<00:03:54.000> you

00:03:54.550 --> 00:03:54.560 
so you

00:03:54.560 --> 00:03:57.850 
so you
goes<00:03:54.709> over<00:03:54.980> that<00:03:55.010> edge<00:03:55.400> and<00:03:55.970> if<00:03:56.480> you<00:03:56.770> get<00:03:57.770> all

00:03:57.850 --> 00:03:57.860 
goes over that edge and if you get all

00:03:57.860 --> 00:03:59.949 
goes over that edge and if you get all
the<00:03:57.950> way<00:03:58.040> out<00:03:58.120> I'll<00:03:59.120> put<00:03:59.239> two<00:03:59.450> of<00:03:59.630> them<00:03:59.720> there

00:03:59.949 --> 00:03:59.959 
the way out I'll put two of them there

00:03:59.959 --> 00:04:03.430 
the way out I'll put two of them there
it'll<00:04:00.739> end<00:04:01.130> up<00:04:01.489> being<00:04:01.790> perfect<00:04:02.110> then<00:04:03.110> put<00:04:03.290> some

00:04:03.430 --> 00:04:03.440 
it'll end up being perfect then put some

00:04:03.440 --> 00:04:04.660 
it'll end up being perfect then put some
little<00:04:03.530> designs<00:04:03.920> or<00:04:04.130> whatever<00:04:04.340> I<00:04:04.459> want
