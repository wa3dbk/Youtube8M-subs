00:00:46.410 --> 00:00:48.619 
forced to like he told me that I might
be<00:00:46.559> getting<00:00:46.710> a<00:00:47.399> ticket<00:00:47.879> in<00:00:48.090> the<00:00:48.120> mail<00:00:48.210> from<00:00:48.570> the

00:00:48.619 --> 00:00:48.629 
be getting a ticket in the mail from the

00:00:48.629 --> 00:00:50.750 
be getting a ticket in the mail from the
light<00:00:48.899> so<00:00:49.350> I<00:00:49.379> read<00:00:49.710> the<00:00:49.860> ticket<00:00:50.039> and<00:00:50.430> it<00:00:50.550> said

00:00:50.750 --> 00:00:50.760 
light so I read the ticket and it said

00:00:50.760 --> 00:00:53.209 
light so I read the ticket and it said
that<00:00:50.789> if<00:00:51.059> I<00:00:51.239> wait<00:00:51.539> 15<00:00:51.960> days<00:00:51.989> and<00:00:52.530> don't<00:00:52.949> pay<00:00:53.100> the

00:00:53.209 --> 00:00:53.219 
that if I wait 15 days and don't pay the

00:00:53.219 --> 00:00:54.799 
that if I wait 15 days and don't pay the
fee<00:00:53.399> then<00:00:53.579> they'll<00:00:53.730> give<00:00:53.879> me<00:00:53.910> a<00:00:54.000> court<00:00:54.270> date<00:00:54.449> so

00:00:54.799 --> 00:00:54.809 
fee then they'll give me a court date so

00:00:54.809 --> 00:00:56.600 
fee then they'll give me a court date so
I<00:00:54.840> figured<00:00:55.199> I<00:00:55.289> had<00:00:55.440> a<00:00:55.469> pretty<00:00:56.070> strong<00:00:56.340> case

00:00:56.600 --> 00:00:56.610 
I figured I had a pretty strong case

00:00:56.610 --> 00:00:58.069 
I figured I had a pretty strong case
because<00:00:56.969> I<00:00:57.180> mean<00:00:57.329> the<00:00:57.480> light<00:00:57.660> was<00:00:57.870> photo

00:00:58.069 --> 00:00:58.079 
because I mean the light was photo

00:00:58.079 --> 00:01:00.529 
because I mean the light was photo
enforced<00:00:58.620> so<00:00:58.949> if<00:00:59.280> I<00:00:59.550> did<00:00:59.850> run<00:01:00.059> the<00:01:00.090> red<00:01:00.329> light

00:01:00.529 --> 00:01:00.539 
enforced so if I did run the red light

00:01:00.539 --> 00:01:03.080 
enforced so if I did run the red light
then<00:01:01.250> there<00:01:02.250> should<00:01:02.399> be<00:01:02.489> photographic

00:01:03.080 --> 00:01:03.090 
then there should be photographic

00:01:03.090 --> 00:01:04.460 
then there should be photographic
evidence<00:01:03.210> of<00:01:03.600> it<00:01:03.780> and<00:01:03.960> if<00:01:04.110> there's<00:01:04.290> no

00:01:04.460 --> 00:01:04.470 
evidence of it and if there's no

00:01:04.470 --> 00:01:06.200 
evidence of it and if there's no
evidence<00:01:04.860> of<00:01:05.010> it<00:01:05.129> I<00:01:05.280> mean<00:01:05.400> it's<00:01:05.549> a<00:01:05.610> machine<00:01:05.729> so

00:01:06.200 --> 00:01:06.210 
evidence of it I mean it's a machine so

00:01:06.210 --> 00:01:07.730 
evidence of it I mean it's a machine so
that<00:01:06.390> literally<00:01:06.810> means<00:01:06.930> that<00:01:07.080> I<00:01:07.200> didn't<00:01:07.590> run

00:01:07.730 --> 00:01:07.740 
that literally means that I didn't run

00:01:07.740 --> 00:01:10.219 
that literally means that I didn't run
the<00:01:07.770> red<00:01:08.010> light<00:01:08.220> that<00:01:08.490> was<00:01:08.640> my<00:01:08.790> plan<00:01:09.030> but<00:01:09.630> the

00:01:10.229 --> 00:01:12.380 
the red light that was my plan but the
people<00:01:10.590> that<00:01:10.860> received<00:01:11.250> my<00:01:11.520> mail<00:01:11.760> that<00:01:12.150> then
