00:00:28.009 --> 00:00:28.019 

00:00:28.019 --> 00:00:30.509 

I'm<00:00:29.019> not<00:00:29.140> sure<00:00:29.380> I<00:00:29.410> like<00:00:29.500> the<00:00:29.830> way<00:00:29.980> that<00:00:30.160> the

00:00:30.509 --> 00:00:30.519 
I'm not sure I like the way that the

00:00:30.519 --> 00:00:33.750 
I'm not sure I like the way that the
center<00:00:30.910> foot<00:00:31.179> is<00:00:31.359> well<00:00:32.020> you<00:00:32.410> just<00:00:32.590> have<00:00:32.760> the

00:00:33.750 --> 00:00:33.760 
center foot is well you just have the

00:00:33.760 --> 00:00:36.090 
center foot is well you just have the
thing<00:00:34.390> you<00:00:34.480> could<00:00:34.660> call<00:00:35.320> that<00:00:35.350> ankle<00:00:35.890> lock

00:00:36.090 --> 00:00:36.100 
thing you could call that ankle lock

00:00:36.100 --> 00:00:38.369 
thing you could call that ankle lock
that<00:00:36.460> prevents<00:00:37.149> it<00:00:37.360> from<00:00:37.510> move<00:00:37.809> around<00:00:38.079> so

00:00:38.369 --> 00:00:38.379 
that prevents it from move around so

00:00:38.379 --> 00:00:42.900 
that prevents it from move around so
Anya<00:00:40.559> okay<00:00:41.559> oh<00:00:41.769> so<00:00:42.129> you<00:00:42.190> have<00:00:42.430> an<00:00:42.550> ink<00:00:42.699> lock

yeah I actually really I mean it's

00:01:04.110 --> 00:01:13.610 
yeah I actually really I mean it's
really<00:01:04.550> controllable<00:01:11.660> it<00:01:12.660> moves<00:01:13.200> quite

00:01:13.610 --> 00:01:13.620 
really controllable it moves quite

00:01:13.620 --> 00:01:15.740 
really controllable it moves quite
nicely<00:01:13.860> that<00:01:14.340> the<00:01:14.790> minimum<00:01:15.030> speed<00:01:15.390> is<00:01:15.570> like

00:01:15.740 --> 00:01:15.750 
nicely that the minimum speed is like

00:01:15.750 --> 00:01:18.620 
nicely that the minimum speed is like
about<00:01:16.080> that<00:01:16.320> that's<00:01:16.860> minimum<00:01:17.220> speed<00:01:17.630> Tommy

00:01:18.620 --> 00:01:18.630 
about that that's minimum speed Tommy

00:01:18.630 --> 00:01:26.150 
about that that's minimum speed Tommy
don't<00:01:18.840> get<00:01:18.990> too<00:01:19.140> close<00:01:20.030> and<00:01:21.110> top<00:01:22.110> speed<00:01:22.440> is<00:01:25.160> I'm

00:01:26.150 --> 00:01:26.160 
don't get too close and top speed is I'm

00:01:26.160 --> 00:01:37.840 
don't get too close and top speed is I'm
here

00:01:37.840 --> 00:01:37.850

00:02:05.630 --> 00:02:05.640 
it yeah that's because of the speed

00:02:05.640 --> 00:02:07.419 
it yeah that's because of the speed
controllers<00:02:06.149> i<00:02:06.270> use<00:02:06.479> they<00:02:06.780> have<00:02:06.930> this
