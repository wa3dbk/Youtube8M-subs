see what we have in these other boxes
first<00:01:47.440> so<00:01:48.190> this<00:01:48.970> is<00:01:49.270> a<00:01:50.820> keyboard<00:01:53.160> as<00:01:54.160> I<00:01:54.370> already

00:01:54.600 --> 00:01:54.610 
first so this is a keyboard as I already

00:01:54.610 --> 00:01:57.870 
first so this is a keyboard as I already
know<00:01:54.820> from<00:01:54.970> the<00:01:55.120> German<00:01:55.450> video<00:01:56.490> the<00:01:57.490> keyboard

00:01:57.870 --> 00:01:57.880 
know from the German video the keyboard

00:01:57.880 --> 00:01:59.670 
know from the German video the keyboard
isn't<00:01:58.090> that<00:01:58.390> bad<00:01:58.660> because<00:01:58.870> it<00:01:59.170> has<00:01:59.380> a<00:01:59.410> nice

00:01:59.670 --> 00:01:59.680 
isn't that bad because it has a nice

00:01:59.680 --> 00:02:02.190 
isn't that bad because it has a nice
allium<00:02:00.160> online<00:02:00.550> so<00:02:01.240> you<00:02:01.330> can<00:02:01.450> see<00:02:01.780> here<00:02:02.080> we

00:02:02.190 --> 00:02:02.200 
allium online so you can see here we

00:02:02.200 --> 00:02:05.610 
allium online so you can see here we
have<00:02:02.230> a<00:02:02.350> long<00:02:02.650> USB<00:02:02.950> cable<00:02:03.520> so<00:02:04.180> you<00:02:04.320> have<00:02:05.320> a<00:02:05.350> long

00:02:05.610 --> 00:02:05.620 
have a long USB cable so you have a long

00:02:05.620 --> 00:02:07.980 
have a long USB cable so you have a long
reach<00:02:05.890> its<00:02:06.220> not<00:02:06.370> Wi-Fi<00:02:06.880> so<00:02:07.210> it's<00:02:07.420> fast<00:02:07.690> enough

00:02:07.980 --> 00:02:07.990 
reach its not Wi-Fi so it's fast enough

00:02:07.990 --> 00:02:10.710 
reach its not Wi-Fi so it's fast enough
for<00:02:08.200> really<00:02:08.530> hardcore<00:02:09.399> gaming<00:02:09.850> it's<00:02:10.270> not<00:02:10.450> too

00:02:10.710 --> 00:02:10.720 
for really hardcore gaming it's not too

00:02:10.720 --> 00:02:13.170 
for really hardcore gaming it's not too
loud<00:02:10.960> this<00:02:11.800> space<00:02:12.100> and<00:02:12.430> to<00:02:12.550> enter<00:02:12.700> buttons<00:02:13.090> a

00:02:13.170 --> 00:02:13.180 
loud this space and to enter buttons a

00:02:13.180 --> 00:02:14.490 
loud this space and to enter buttons a
little<00:02:13.210> bit<00:02:13.540> louder<00:02:13.750> than<00:02:14.020> the<00:02:14.050> other<00:02:14.260> ones

00:02:14.490 --> 00:02:14.500 
little bit louder than the other ones

00:02:14.500 --> 00:02:16.860 
little bit louder than the other ones
but<00:02:14.740> it<00:02:15.280> actually<00:02:15.490> feels<00:02:15.850> quite<00:02:16.150> nice<00:02:16.450> you<00:02:16.690> can

you can install all the special software
that<00:03:12.550> we<00:03:12.670> need<00:03:12.790> for<00:03:13.330> this<00:03:13.510> LEM<00:03:13.959> there<00:03:14.140> and<00:03:14.459> you

00:03:15.449 --> 00:03:15.459 
that we need for this LEM there and you

00:03:15.459 --> 00:03:17.550 
that we need for this LEM there and you
really<00:03:15.850> need<00:03:16.000> it<00:03:16.150> because<00:03:16.300> we<00:03:16.660> have<00:03:16.840> some<00:03:17.110> LED

00:03:17.550 --> 00:03:17.560 
really need it because we have some LED

00:03:17.560 --> 00:03:19.290 
really need it because we have some LED
lights<00:03:17.590> in<00:03:17.950> here<00:03:18.160> that<00:03:18.640> are<00:03:18.670> really<00:03:19.090> special

lights in here that are really special

00:03:19.300 --> 00:03:22.080 
lights in here that are really special
so<00:03:19.630> you<00:03:19.690> can<00:03:19.959> for<00:03:20.260> example<00:03:20.610> use<00:03:21.610> this<00:03:21.850> device

00:03:22.080 --> 00:03:22.090 
so you can for example use this device

00:03:22.090 --> 00:03:26.250 
so you can for example use this device
with<00:03:22.600> and<00:03:24.300> different<00:03:25.300> games<00:03:25.570> and<00:03:25.870> different

00:03:26.250 --> 00:03:26.260 
with and different games and different

00:03:26.260 --> 00:03:28.770 
with and different games and different
them<00:03:26.519> LED<00:03:27.519> settings<00:03:27.970> so<00:03:28.239> if<00:03:28.450> you<00:03:28.570> kill

00:03:28.770 --> 00:03:28.780 
them LED settings so if you kill

00:03:28.780 --> 00:03:30.780 
them LED settings so if you kill
somebody<00:03:29.019> it<00:03:29.320> goes<00:03:29.530> red<00:03:29.860> and<00:03:30.100> something<00:03:30.760> like

00:03:30.780 --> 00:03:30.790 
somebody it goes red and something like

00:03:30.790 --> 00:03:32.820 
somebody it goes red and something like
that<00:03:31.060> you<00:03:31.180> can<00:03:31.390> do<00:03:31.570> all<00:03:31.600> that<00:03:32.019> with<00:03:32.260> this<00:03:32.410> le<00:03:32.680> in

00:03:32.820 --> 00:03:32.830 
that you can do all that with this le in

00:03:32.830 --> 00:03:34.830 
that you can do all that with this le in

have<00:04:25.380> their<00:04:25.650> razor<00:04:26.220> or<00:04:26.640> other<00:04:27.210> mouse<00:04:27.930> that<00:04:28.200> do

00:04:28.370 --> 00:04:28.380 
have their razor or other mouse that do

00:04:28.380 --> 00:04:31.490 
have their razor or other mouse that do
it<00:04:28.530> that<00:04:28.830> they<00:04:29.400> will<00:04:29.610> use<00:04:29.880> then<00:04:30.810> we<00:04:31.020> have<00:04:31.230> of

00:04:31.490 --> 00:04:31.500 
it that they will use then we have of

00:04:31.500 --> 00:04:35.480 
it that they will use then we have of
course<00:04:31.530> a<00:04:32.720> long<00:04:33.720> power<00:04:34.020> cable<00:04:34.500> and<00:04:34.680> a<00:04:35.070> really

00:04:35.480 --> 00:04:35.490 
course a long power cable and a really

00:04:35.490 --> 00:04:39.470 
course a long power cable and a really
big<00:04:35.730> and<00:04:35.940> heavy<00:04:36.740> well<00:04:37.740> yes<00:04:38.130> this<00:04:38.820> isn't<00:04:39.240> and

00:04:39.470 --> 00:04:39.480 
big and heavy well yes this isn't and

00:04:39.480 --> 00:04:42.320 
big and heavy well yes this isn't and
then<00:04:40.470> go<00:04:40.710> into<00:04:40.950> the<00:04:41.130> PvP<00:04:41.580> see<00:04:41.820> that's<00:04:42.090> why<00:04:42.300> it's

00:04:42.320 --> 00:04:42.330 
then go into the PvP see that's why it's

00:04:42.330 --> 00:04:44.450 
then go into the PvP see that's why it's
actually<00:04:42.660> so<00:04:42.840> small<00:04:43.110> I<00:04:43.140> would<00:04:43.440> say<00:04:43.650> this<00:04:44.160> is

00:04:44.450 --> 00:04:44.460 
actually so small I would say this is

00:04:44.460 --> 00:04:46.310 
actually so small I would say this is
the<00:04:44.490> psu<00:04:45.180> and<00:04:45.419> it's<00:04:45.540> as<00:04:45.750> heavy<00:04:45.990> as<00:04:46.169> an

00:04:46.310 --> 00:04:46.320 
the psu and it's as heavy as an

00:04:46.320 --> 00:04:48.920 
the psu and it's as heavy as an
ultrabook<00:04:46.650> but<00:04:46.979> well<00:04:47.550> and<00:04:47.850> that's<00:04:48.540> the<00:04:48.690> price

00:04:48.920 --> 00:04:48.930 
ultrabook but well and that's the price

00:04:48.930 --> 00:04:51.020 
ultrabook but well and that's the price
have<00:04:49.110> to<00:04:49.229> pay<00:04:49.410> for<00:04:49.470> a<00:04:49.680> small<00:04:50.010> computer<00:04:50.430> we<00:04:50.850> have

00:04:51.020 --> 00:04:51.030 
have to pay for a small computer we have

00:04:51.030 --> 00:04:52.880 
have to pay for a small computer we have
an<00:04:51.150> LED<00:04:51.510> right<00:04:51.780> here<00:04:52.050> and<00:04:52.200> that's<00:04:52.710> actually

00:04:52.880 --> 00:04:52.890 
an LED right here and that's actually

00:04:52.890 --> 00:04:57.770 
an LED right here and that's actually
pit<00:04:53.310> from<00:04:53.910> this<00:04:54.300> tiny<00:04:55.880> box<00:04:56.880> everything<00:04:57.390> else

element pc which you see right here we

00:05:04.890 --> 00:05:07.550 
element pc which you see right here we
have<00:05:05.130> two<00:05:05.729> USB<00:05:05.880> ports<00:05:06.150> actually<00:05:06.780> headphone

00:05:07.550 --> 00:05:07.560 
have two USB ports actually headphone

00:05:07.560 --> 00:05:09.650 
have two USB ports actually headphone
microphone<00:05:07.830> this<00:05:08.640> is<00:05:08.790> all<00:05:09.000> I<00:05:09.030> glossy<00:05:09.450> on<00:05:09.570> the

microphone this is all I glossy on the

00:05:09.660 --> 00:05:11.719 
microphone this is all I glossy on the
front<00:05:09.900> we<00:05:10.350> can<00:05:10.380> take<00:05:10.770> off<00:05:10.950> the<00:05:11.100> foil<00:05:11.340> actually

00:05:11.729 --> 00:05:14.719 
front we can take off the foil actually
so<00:05:11.910> you<00:05:12.000> can<00:05:12.180> see<00:05:12.780> more<00:05:13.050> of<00:05:13.110> that<00:05:13.550> not<00:05:14.550> so<00:05:14.700> easy

00:05:14.719 --> 00:05:14.729 
so you can see more of that not so easy

00:05:14.729 --> 00:05:16.630 
so you can see more of that not so easy
to<00:05:15.000> take<00:05:15.270> all<00:05:15.510> of<00:05:15.540> the<00:05:15.720> foil<00:05:15.960> off<00:05:16.050> because<00:05:16.380> it's

everywhere but we will try so we have

00:05:22.830 --> 00:05:25.219 
everywhere but we will try so we have
two<00:05:23.010> USB<00:05:23.220> ports<00:05:23.430> and<00:05:24.419> headphone<00:05:24.990> port

this<00:06:01.440> kind<00:06:01.740> of<00:06:01.800> language<00:06:01.920> then<00:06:02.760> we<00:06:02.940> have<00:06:03.120> on

00:06:03.230 --> 00:06:03.240 
this kind of language then we have on

00:06:03.240 --> 00:06:06.970 
this kind of language then we have on
the<00:06:03.300> other<00:06:03.390> side<00:06:03.690> again<00:06:04.140> an<00:06:04.800> Eliam<00:06:05.250> they<00:06:05.400> are

but<00:06:28.200> before<00:06:28.530> we<00:06:28.620> do<00:06:28.740> that<00:06:28.770> let's<00:06:29.400> check<00:06:29.550> out

00:06:29.840 --> 00:06:29.850 
but before we do that let's check out

00:06:29.850 --> 00:06:31.550 
but before we do that let's check out
the<00:06:29.880> back<00:06:30.150> because<00:06:30.330> we<00:06:30.630> have<00:06:30.780> of<00:06:30.870> course<00:06:31.050> a<00:06:31.290> lot

00:06:31.550 --> 00:06:31.560 
the back because we have of course a lot

00:06:31.560 --> 00:06:35.150 
the back because we have of course a lot
of<00:06:32.010> plugs<00:06:32.820> in<00:06:33.300> here<00:06:33.660> we<00:06:33.870> have<00:06:34.050> an<00:06:34.380> digital

00:06:35.150 --> 00:06:35.160 
of plugs in here we have an digital

00:06:35.160 --> 00:06:39.050 
of plugs in here we have an digital
audio<00:06:35.430> out<00:06:35.490> and<00:06:36.210> optical<00:06:37.170> audio<00:06:37.260> out<00:06:37.650> hdmi<00:06:38.190> for

00:06:39.050 --> 00:06:39.060 
audio out and optical audio out hdmi for

00:06:39.060 --> 00:06:41.330 
audio out and optical audio out hdmi for
USB<00:06:39.480> 2.0<00:06:39.660> is<00:06:40.140> that<00:06:40.350> give<00:06:40.620> out<00:06:40.770> extra<00:06:41.130> power

00:06:41.330 --> 00:06:41.340 
USB 2.0 is that give out extra power

00:06:41.340 --> 00:06:44.360 
USB 2.0 is that give out extra power
because<00:06:42.030> they<00:06:42.180> have<00:06:42.330> a<00:06:42.360> plus<00:06:42.980> gigabit<00:06:43.980> lan<00:06:44.190> of

00:06:44.360 --> 00:06:44.370 
because they have a plus gigabit lan of

00:06:44.370 --> 00:06:50.020 
because they have a plus gigabit lan of
course<00:06:44.640> USB<00:06:44.970> 3.0<00:06:45.480> then<00:06:46.350> m<00:06:46.740> 5.1<00:06:47.550> audio<00:06:48.090> and

00:06:50.020 --> 00:06:50.030 
course USB 3.0 then m 5.1 audio and

00:06:50.030 --> 00:06:52.640 
course USB 3.0 then m 5.1 audio and
power<00:06:51.030> on<00:06:51.270> the<00:06:51.360> bottom<00:06:51.720> mackenzie<00:06:52.230> lock<00:06:52.500> is

00:06:52.640 --> 00:06:52.650 
power on the bottom mackenzie lock is

00:06:52.650 --> 00:06:54.110 
power on the bottom mackenzie lock is
right<00:06:52.890> here<00:06:53.130> but<00:06:53.310> i<00:06:53.340> don't<00:06:53.640> think<00:06:53.730> that<00:06:53.970> you

00:06:54.110 --> 00:06:54.120 
right here but i don't think that you

00:06:54.120 --> 00:06:56.570 
right here but i don't think that you
will<00:06:54.630> use<00:06:54.840> that<00:06:55.110> a<00:06:55.170> lot<00:06:55.290> to<00:06:55.770> DV<00:06:56.070> is<00:06:56.100> and<00:06:56.490> I<00:06:56.550> think

00:06:56.570 --> 00:06:56.580 
will use that a lot to DV is and I think

00:06:56.580 --> 00:06:59.210 
will use that a lot to DV is and I think
this<00:06:56.910> is<00:06:56.970> an<00:06:57.150> HDMI<00:06:58.140> but<00:06:58.470> actually<00:06:58.950> I<00:06:58.980> would

00:06:59.210 --> 00:06:59.220 
this is an HDMI but actually I would

00:06:59.220 --> 00:07:00.980 
this is an HDMI but actually I would
rather<00:06:59.400> say<00:06:59.760> this<00:06:59.970> is<00:07:00.090> a<00:07:00.120> display<00:07:00.510> port<00:07:00.810> and

00:07:00.980 --> 00:07:00.990 
rather say this is a display port and

00:07:00.990 --> 00:07:04.190 
rather say this is a display port and
then<00:07:01.710> of<00:07:01.830> course<00:07:02.100> we<00:07:02.640> have<00:07:02.790> the<00:07:02.820> i7<00:07:03.450> here<00:07:03.690> let's

00:07:04.190 --> 00:07:04.200 
then of course we have the i7 here let's

00:07:04.200 --> 00:07:07.310 
then of course we have the i7 here let's
take<00:07:04.800> this<00:07:05.130> top<00:07:05.820> off<00:07:06.120> and<00:07:06.360> see<00:07:06.600> how<00:07:07.050> it<00:07:07.110> looks

00:07:07.310 --> 00:07:07.320 
take this top off and see how it looks

00:07:07.320 --> 00:07:10.520 
take this top off and see how it looks
from<00:07:07.560> the<00:07:07.700> inside<00:07:08.960> because<00:07:09.960> I<00:07:10.080> guess<00:07:10.230> you<00:07:10.380> want

00:07:10.520 --> 00:07:10.530 
from the inside because I guess you want

00:07:10.530 --> 00:07:13.130 
from the inside because I guess you want
to<00:07:10.590> see<00:07:10.740> that<00:07:10.950> and<00:07:11.790> there<00:07:12.240> is<00:07:12.390> of<00:07:12.570> course<00:07:12.600> one

00:07:13.130 --> 00:07:13.140 
to see that and there is of course one

00:07:13.140 --> 00:07:15.620 
to see that and there is of course one
kill<00:07:13.620> that<00:07:13.830> you<00:07:14.010> have<00:07:14.190> to<00:07:14.310> unhook<00:07:14.490> first<00:07:14.940> for

00:07:15.620 --> 00:07:15.630 
kill that you have to unhook first for

00:07:15.630 --> 00:07:18.380 
kill that you have to unhook first for
the<00:07:15.780> LEDs<00:07:16.140> there<00:07:17.010> we<00:07:17.100> go<00:07:17.250> and<00:07:17.520> then<00:07:18.120> you<00:07:18.240> can

00:07:18.380 --> 00:07:18.390 
the LEDs there we go and then you can

00:07:18.390 --> 00:07:21.740 
the LEDs there we go and then you can
see<00:07:18.600> this<00:07:18.900> is<00:07:19.050> metal<00:07:19.380> independent<00:07:20.600> inside<00:07:21.600> of

00:07:21.740 --> 00:07:21.750 
see this is metal independent inside of

00:07:21.750 --> 00:07:24.650 
see this is metal independent inside of
course<00:07:22.020> and<00:07:22.290> here<00:07:22.800> we<00:07:23.190> have<00:07:23.390> graphics<00:07:24.390> card

00:07:24.650 --> 00:07:24.660 
course and here we have graphics card

00:07:24.660 --> 00:07:27.590 
course and here we have graphics card
DVD<00:07:25.500> drive<00:07:25.800> under<00:07:26.190> the<00:07:26.340> DVD<00:07:26.790> Drive<00:07:27.000> I<00:07:27.150> guess<00:07:27.360> is

00:07:27.590 --> 00:07:27.600 
DVD drive under the DVD Drive I guess is

00:07:27.600 --> 00:07:29.630 
DVD drive under the DVD Drive I guess is
the<00:07:27.630> hand<00:07:27.990> right<00:07:28.230> but<00:07:28.410> I'm<00:07:28.530> not<00:07:28.680> sure<00:07:28.710> now<00:07:29.580> the

00:07:29.630 --> 00:07:29.640 
the hand right but I'm not sure now the

00:07:29.640 --> 00:07:32.360 
the hand right but I'm not sure now the
hardware<00:07:30.060> is<00:07:30.180> under<00:07:30.540> the<00:07:31.160> graphics<00:07:32.160> card

00:07:32.360 --> 00:07:32.370 
hardware is under the graphics card

00:07:32.370 --> 00:07:34.370 
hardware is under the graphics card
actually<00:07:32.550> and<00:07:32.940> then<00:07:33.240> we<00:07:33.360> have<00:07:33.510> the<00:07:33.660> CPU<00:07:34.080> here

00:07:34.370 --> 00:07:34.380 
actually and then we have the CPU here

00:07:34.380 --> 00:07:38.120 
actually and then we have the CPU here
and<00:07:34.590> RAM<00:07:35.250> right<00:07:35.550> there<00:07:35.850> but<00:07:36.450> i<00:07:36.630> will<00:07:37.070> show<00:07:38.070> you

00:07:38.120 --> 00:07:38.130 
and RAM right there but i will show you

00:07:38.130 --> 00:07:40.940 
and RAM right there but i will show you
right<00:07:38.460> here<00:07:38.520> actually<00:07:38.970> so<00:07:39.480> there<00:07:40.320> is<00:07:40.560> the<00:07:40.740> ram

00:07:40.940 --> 00:07:40.950 
right here actually so there is the ram

00:07:40.950 --> 00:07:43.610 
right here actually so there is the ram
right<00:07:41.250> next<00:07:41.520> to<00:07:41.580> the<00:07:41.700> cpu<00:07:42.270> and<00:07:42.510> then<00:07:43.200> we<00:07:43.350> have

00:07:43.610 --> 00:07:43.620 
right next to the cpu and then we have

00:07:43.620 --> 00:07:46.850 
right next to the cpu and then we have
DVD<00:07:44.460> I'm<00:07:45.090> graphics<00:07:45.870> card<00:07:46.110> and<00:07:46.380> a<00:07:46.440> graphics

00:07:46.850 --> 00:07:46.860 
DVD I'm graphics card and a graphics

00:07:46.860 --> 00:07:49.130 
DVD I'm graphics card and a graphics
card<00:07:46.920> is<00:07:47.220> the<00:07:47.400> hard<00:07:47.940> drive<00:07:48.120> which<00:07:48.570> you<00:07:48.720> can<00:07:48.900> see

00:07:49.130 --> 00:07:49.140 
card is the hard drive which you can see

00:07:49.140 --> 00:07:51.110 
card is the hard drive which you can see
down<00:07:49.740> there<00:07:50.130> thank<00:07:50.520> you<00:07:50.580> much<00:07:50.700> for<00:07:50.820> watching<00:07:50.880> a
