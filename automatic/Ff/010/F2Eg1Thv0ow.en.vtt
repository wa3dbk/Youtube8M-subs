in<00:00:00.060> the<00:00:00.599> first<00:00:00.810> two<00:00:00.989> parts<00:00:01.170> of<00:00:01.350> this<00:00:01.469> series<00:00:01.530> we

00:00:02.090 --> 00:00:02.100 
in the first two parts of this series we

00:00:02.100 --> 00:00:03.800 
in the first two parts of this series we
discussed<00:00:02.220> different<00:00:02.669> categories<00:00:03.330> of<00:00:03.449> law<00:00:03.480> in

00:00:03.800 --> 00:00:03.810 
discussed different categories of law in

00:00:03.810 --> 00:00:06.079 
discussed different categories of law in
the<00:00:03.929> Old<00:00:04.049> Testament<00:00:04.170> and<00:00:04.680> why<00:00:05.490> this<00:00:05.549> means<00:00:05.850> to

00:00:06.079 --> 00:00:06.089 
the Old Testament and why this means to

00:00:06.089 --> 00:00:07.760 
the Old Testament and why this means to
be<00:00:06.180> perfectly<00:00:06.600> legitimate<00:00:07.080> to<00:00:07.319> continue

00:00:07.760 --> 00:00:07.770 
be perfectly legitimate to continue

00:00:07.770 --> 00:00:12.499 
be perfectly legitimate to continue
observe<00:00:08.160> some<00:00:08.519> while<00:00:08.790> ignoring<00:00:09.240> others<00:00:11.509> you

again I finish this series long that oh
yeah<00:00:15.900> well<00:00:16.139> I<00:00:16.170> got<00:00:16.470> a<00:00:16.500> problem<00:00:16.830> with<00:00:17.160> all<00:00:17.310> of

00:00:17.450 --> 00:00:17.460 
yeah well I got a problem with all of

00:00:17.460 --> 00:00:19.640 
yeah well I got a problem with all of
this<00:00:17.580> let's<00:00:18.449> say<00:00:18.630> your<00:00:18.810> interpretation<00:00:19.560> is

00:00:19.640 --> 00:00:19.650 
this let's say your interpretation is

00:00:19.650 --> 00:00:21.859 
this let's say your interpretation is
accurate<00:00:20.130> without<00:00:20.970> demonstrates<00:00:21.720> the

00:00:21.859 --> 00:00:21.869 
accurate without demonstrates the

00:00:21.869 --> 00:00:23.630 
accurate without demonstrates the
complete<00:00:22.199> lack<00:00:22.439> of<00:00:22.619> moral<00:00:22.980> relevance<00:00:23.430> to<00:00:23.519> the

00:00:23.630 --> 00:00:23.640 
complete lack of moral relevance to the

00:00:23.640 --> 00:00:26.269 
complete lack of moral relevance to the
Bible<00:00:24.000> to<00:00:24.119> our<00:00:24.269> time<00:00:24.539> and<00:00:24.750> culture<00:00:24.980> it<00:00:25.980> also

00:00:26.269 --> 00:00:26.279 
Bible to our time and culture it also

00:00:26.279 --> 00:00:28.070 
Bible to our time and culture it also
virtually<00:00:26.699> destroys<00:00:27.119> any<00:00:27.449> claims<00:00:27.779> to<00:00:27.900> the

00:00:28.070 --> 00:00:28.080 
virtually destroys any claims to the

00:00:28.080 --> 00:00:30.410 
virtually destroys any claims to the
Bible's<00:00:28.439> divine<00:00:28.710> inspiration<00:00:29.460> because<00:00:30.090> it

00:00:30.410 --> 00:00:30.420 
Bible's divine inspiration because it

00:00:30.420 --> 00:00:32.359 
Bible's divine inspiration because it
clearly<00:00:30.720> has<00:00:31.019> no<00:00:31.230> moral<00:00:31.560> insights<00:00:32.009> beyond

00:00:32.359 --> 00:00:32.369 
clearly has no moral insights beyond

00:00:32.369 --> 00:00:33.950 
clearly has no moral insights beyond
that<00:00:32.579> of<00:00:32.669> a<00:00:32.730> first<00:00:33.000> century<00:00:33.180> middle-eastern

00:00:33.950 --> 00:00:33.960 
that of a first century middle-eastern

00:00:33.960 --> 00:00:36.330 
that of a first century middle-eastern
tribal<00:00:34.380> culture

00:00:36.330 --> 00:00:36.340 
tribal culture

00:00:36.340 --> 00:00:38.670 
tribal culture
yeah<00:00:37.300> that's<00:00:37.540> an<00:00:37.690> unreasonable<00:00:38.110> demand

00:00:38.670 --> 00:00:38.680 
yeah that's an unreasonable demand

00:00:38.680 --> 00:00:40.950 
yeah that's an unreasonable demand
invented<00:00:39.340> in<00:00:39.460> modern<00:00:39.820> times<00:00:40.120> by<00:00:40.420> members<00:00:40.780> of<00:00:40.810> a

00:00:40.950 --> 00:00:40.960 
invented in modern times by members of a

00:00:40.960 --> 00:00:42.960 
invented in modern times by members of a
culture<00:00:41.200> that<00:00:41.500> thinks<00:00:41.740> too<00:00:41.860> highly<00:00:41.890> of<00:00:42.340> itself

00:00:42.960 --> 00:00:42.970 
culture that thinks too highly of itself

00:00:42.970 --> 00:00:50.670 
culture that thinks too highly of itself
sit<00:00:43.510> down<00:00:48.360> okay<00:00:49.360> although<00:00:49.780> this<00:00:50.080> objection<00:00:50.470> is

00:00:50.670 --> 00:00:50.680 
sit down okay although this objection is

00:00:50.680 --> 00:00:52.320 
sit down okay although this objection is
pretty<00:00:50.920> darn<00:00:51.190> bigoted<00:00:51.640> let's<00:00:52.000> take<00:00:52.180> it

00:00:52.320 --> 00:00:52.330 
pretty darn bigoted let's take it

00:00:52.330 --> 00:00:53.580 
pretty darn bigoted let's take it
seriously<00:00:52.750> for<00:00:53.050> a<00:00:53.080> moment

00:00:53.580 --> 00:00:53.590 
seriously for a moment

00:00:53.590 --> 00:00:55.770 
seriously for a moment
the<00:00:54.310> real<00:00:54.460> question<00:00:54.850> is<00:00:55.000> does<00:00:55.630> the

00:00:55.770 --> 00:00:55.780 
the real question is does the

00:00:55.780 --> 00:00:57.750 
the real question is does the
contextualize<00:00:56.200> relevance<00:00:57.040> of<00:00:57.160> the<00:00:57.280> law<00:00:57.460> and

00:00:57.750 --> 00:00:57.760 
contextualize relevance of the law and

00:00:57.760 --> 00:00:59.660 
contextualize relevance of the law and
other<00:00:58.300> parts<00:00:58.630> of<00:00:58.690> the<00:00:58.810> Bible<00:00:59.110> as<00:00:59.260> well

00:00:59.660 --> 00:00:59.670 
other parts of the Bible as well

00:00:59.670 --> 00:01:01.770 
other parts of the Bible as well
demonstrate<00:01:00.670> both<00:01:00.820> a<00:01:00.970> lack<00:01:01.150> of<00:01:01.180> relevance<00:01:01.720> to

00:01:01.770 --> 00:01:01.780 
demonstrate both a lack of relevance to

00:01:01.780 --> 00:01:03.810 
demonstrate both a lack of relevance to
our<00:01:02.020> culture<00:01:02.530> and<00:01:02.620> indicate<00:01:03.520> a<00:01:03.550> lack<00:01:03.760> of

00:01:03.810 --> 00:01:03.820 
our culture and indicate a lack of

00:01:03.820 --> 00:01:07.470 
our culture and indicate a lack of
inspiration<00:01:06.180> generally<00:01:07.180> there<00:01:07.360> are<00:01:07.390> three

00:01:07.470 --> 00:01:07.480 
inspiration generally there are three

00:01:07.480 --> 00:01:08.969 
inspiration generally there are three
arguments<00:01:08.080> that<00:01:08.200> can<00:01:08.320> be<00:01:08.410> pushed<00:01:08.590> back<00:01:08.800> at

00:01:08.969 --> 00:01:08.979 
arguments that can be pushed back at

00:01:08.979 --> 00:01:11.580 
arguments that can be pushed back at
this<00:01:09.100> sort<00:01:09.340> of<00:01:09.400> objection<00:01:10.110> one<00:01:11.110> is<00:01:11.260> that<00:01:11.440> any

00:01:11.580 --> 00:01:11.590 
this sort of objection one is that any

00:01:11.590 --> 00:01:13.109 
this sort of objection one is that any
set<00:01:11.860> of<00:01:11.979> moral<00:01:12.250> instructions<00:01:12.790> that<00:01:12.910> would<00:01:13.000> be

00:01:13.109 --> 00:01:13.119 
set of moral instructions that would be

00:01:13.119 --> 00:01:14.550 
set of moral instructions that would be
able<00:01:13.300> to<00:01:13.360> cover<00:01:13.570> every<00:01:13.990> time<00:01:14.200> and<00:01:14.410> culture

00:01:14.550 --> 00:01:14.560 
able to cover every time and culture

00:01:14.560 --> 00:01:16.380 
able to cover every time and culture
would<00:01:14.920> be<00:01:14.950> either<00:01:15.220> too<00:01:15.490> vague<00:01:15.790> to<00:01:15.820> be<00:01:16.119> of<00:01:16.240> much

00:01:16.380 --> 00:01:16.390 
would be either too vague to be of much

00:01:16.390 --> 00:01:18.630 
would be either too vague to be of much
use<00:01:16.450> to<00:01:16.720> anyone<00:01:17.080> or<00:01:17.920> else<00:01:18.010> so<00:01:18.220> comprehensive

00:01:18.630 --> 00:01:18.640 
use to anyone or else so comprehensive

00:01:18.640 --> 00:01:20.900 
use to anyone or else so comprehensive
as<00:01:19.090> to<00:01:19.210> be<00:01:19.300> logistically<00:01:19.660> impossible

00:01:20.900 --> 00:01:20.910 
as to be logistically impossible

00:01:20.910 --> 00:01:23.820 
as to be logistically impossible
think<00:01:21.910> about<00:01:22.119> this<00:01:22.330> a<00:01:22.600> Bible<00:01:23.290> that<00:01:23.470> covered

00:01:23.820 --> 00:01:23.830 
think about this a Bible that covered

00:01:23.830 --> 00:01:25.200 
think about this a Bible that covered
every<00:01:23.979> chronological<00:01:24.729> and<00:01:24.790> cultural

00:01:25.200 --> 00:01:25.210 
every chronological and cultural

00:01:25.210 --> 00:01:26.670 
every chronological and cultural
situation<00:01:25.780> isn't<00:01:25.930> something<00:01:26.380> you'd<00:01:26.500> be<00:01:26.590> able

00:01:26.670 --> 00:01:26.680 
situation isn't something you'd be able

00:01:26.680 --> 00:01:28.980 
situation isn't something you'd be able
to<00:01:26.800> talk<00:01:27.040> to<00:01:27.160> church<00:01:27.400> with<00:01:27.580> you<00:01:27.640> on<00:01:27.790> Sunday<00:01:28.060> not

00:01:28.980 --> 00:01:28.990 
to talk to church with you on Sunday not

00:01:28.990 --> 00:01:30.060 
to talk to church with you on Sunday not
unless<00:01:29.170> you<00:01:29.320> wanted<00:01:29.530> to<00:01:29.619> bring<00:01:29.800> it<00:01:29.920> in<00:01:30.009> a

00:01:30.060 --> 00:01:30.070 
unless you wanted to bring it in a

00:01:30.070 --> 00:01:36.150 
unless you wanted to bring it in a
moving<00:01:30.369> van<00:01:34.259> the<00:01:35.259> second<00:01:35.619> point<00:01:35.710> is<00:01:35.860> that<00:01:36.009> God

00:01:36.150 --> 00:01:36.160 
moving van the second point is that God

00:01:36.160 --> 00:01:38.219 
moving van the second point is that God
seeks<00:01:36.460> disciples<00:01:37.060> not<00:01:37.630> people<00:01:37.960> who<00:01:38.050> want

00:01:38.219 --> 00:01:38.229 
seeks disciples not people who want

00:01:38.229 --> 00:01:39.749 
seeks disciples not people who want
things<00:01:38.440> handed<00:01:38.830> to<00:01:38.920> them<00:01:39.009> on<00:01:39.100> a<00:01:39.160> platter

00:01:39.749 --> 00:01:39.759 
things handed to them on a platter

00:01:39.759 --> 00:01:41.490 
things handed to them on a platter
so<00:01:40.479> there's<00:01:40.660> no<00:01:40.780> reason<00:01:40.960> why<00:01:41.140> readers

00:01:41.490 --> 00:01:41.500 
so there's no reason why readers

00:01:41.500 --> 00:01:42.810 
so there's no reason why readers
shouldn't<00:01:41.770> be<00:01:41.860> expected<00:01:42.310> to<00:01:42.369> do<00:01:42.550> a<00:01:42.580> little

00:01:42.810 --> 00:01:42.820 
shouldn't be expected to do a little

00:01:42.820 --> 00:01:45.419 
shouldn't be expected to do a little
serious<00:01:43.300> study<00:01:43.600> I<00:01:43.840> cover<00:01:44.830> this<00:01:44.979> sort<00:01:45.220> of<00:01:45.250> thing

00:01:45.419 --> 00:01:45.429 
serious study I cover this sort of thing

00:01:45.429 --> 00:01:46.950 
serious study I cover this sort of thing
and<00:01:45.580> two<00:01:45.640> prior<00:01:45.970> vids<00:01:46.270> so<00:01:46.450> I'll<00:01:46.570> leave<00:01:46.720> it<00:01:46.780> at

00:01:46.950 --> 00:01:46.960 
and two prior vids so I'll leave it at

00:01:46.960 --> 00:01:50.279 
and two prior vids so I'll leave it at
that<00:01:48.119> the<00:01:49.119> third<00:01:49.300> reason<00:01:49.539> is<00:01:49.720> probably<00:01:49.929> the

00:01:50.279 --> 00:01:50.289 
that the third reason is probably the

00:01:50.289 --> 00:01:52.590 
that the third reason is probably the
most<00:01:50.410> important<00:01:50.950> one<00:01:50.979> the<00:01:51.940> biggest<00:01:52.270> problem

00:01:52.590 --> 00:01:52.600 
most important one the biggest problem

00:01:52.600 --> 00:01:53.820 
most important one the biggest problem
here<00:01:52.750> is<00:01:52.810> that<00:01:52.840> the<00:01:53.050> modern<00:01:53.380> reader<00:01:53.560> is

00:01:53.820 --> 00:01:53.830 
here is that the modern reader is

00:01:53.830 --> 00:01:56.400 
here is that the modern reader is
obsessed<00:01:54.280> with<00:01:54.369> relevance<00:01:54.910> that<00:01:55.899> economy

00:01:56.410 --> 00:01:58.380 
obsessed with relevance that economy
here<00:01:56.590> is<00:01:56.679> pretty<00:01:56.830> stark<00:01:57.340> it<00:01:57.850> must<00:01:58.090> be<00:01:58.210> relevant

00:01:58.380 --> 00:01:58.390 
here is pretty stark it must be relevant

00:01:58.390 --> 00:02:00.540 
here is pretty stark it must be relevant
to<00:01:58.690> us<00:01:58.810> now<00:01:59.050> or<00:01:59.560> else<00:01:59.679> it's<00:01:59.890> just<00:01:59.979> cluttering

00:02:00.540 --> 00:02:00.550 
to us now or else it's just cluttering

00:02:00.550 --> 00:02:02.760 
to us now or else it's just cluttering
up<00:02:00.700> the<00:02:00.880> Bible<00:02:01.319> well<00:02:02.319> that's<00:02:02.500> more<00:02:02.710> a

00:02:02.760 --> 00:02:02.770 
up the Bible well that's more a

00:02:02.770 --> 00:02:04.469 
up the Bible well that's more a
perception<00:02:03.250> of<00:02:03.340> our<00:02:03.490> own<00:02:03.640> self-importance
