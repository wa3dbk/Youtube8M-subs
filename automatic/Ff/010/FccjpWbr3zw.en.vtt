00:00:00.709 --> 00:00:04.159
 No more 

00:01:24.890 --> 00:01:27.670
 the nation 

00:01:33.510 --> 00:01:39.250
 well it's everyone knows raiden 

00:01:36.400 --> 00:01:41.410
 I hope you'll listen to me 

00:01:39.250 --> 00:01:43.330
 it's great despite the fact that I'm 

00:01:41.410 --> 00:01:45.070
 sick and that I comment this video and 

00:01:43.330 --> 00:01:47.470
 that I 'm going to have a little trouble I think 

00:01:45.070 --> 00:01:49.270
 in any case I hope it's going well 

00:01:47.470 --> 00:01:52.479
 pass because well I do not know if that 

00:01:49.270 --> 00:01:53.979
 get along really well but now I'm 

00:01:52.479 --> 00:01:55.840
 sick I'm going to have trouble talking 

00:01:53.979 --> 00:01:57.430
 so do not blame if I bug a 

00:01:55.840 --> 00:01:58.930
 from time to time I made sure 

00:01:57.430 --> 00:02:00.460
 in addition that the video is not very 

00:01:58.930 --> 00:02:02.170
 very long to avoid getting drunk 

00:02:00.460 --> 00:02:04.000
 so it's just a new 

00:02:02.170 --> 00:02:05.320
 video on at 37 or even allegiance 

00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:08.500
 this is my first d anna that I 

00:02:05.320 --> 00:02:10.959
 directed on atttieratoires for xbox one 

00:02:08.500 --> 00:02:12.640
 I showed you my second dna on my 

00:02:10.959 --> 00:02:13.780
 chain but it was the first one that I 

00:02:12.640 --> 00:02:15.430
 posted on my youtube channel 

00:02:13.780 --> 00:02:17.650
 this is the first one I made and 

00:02:15.430 --> 00:02:19.840
 it's a gameplay very very very very 

00:02:17.650 --> 00:02:21.310
 special there I think that on the one hand you 

00:02:19.840 --> 00:02:23.140
 are you going to type a beard from another 

00:02:21.310 --> 00:02:24.220
 it's going to be less fun, it's going to be a 

00:02:23.140 --> 00:02:26.110
 stuff you're not used to 

00:02:24.220 --> 00:02:27.820
 see necessarily on my channel I think a 

00:02:26.110 --> 00:02:30.459
 summit has no pretense that's all 

00:02:27.820 --> 00:02:31.989
 just a pretty soft gameplay me 

00:02:30.459 --> 00:02:34.209
 also I can call it like that a 

00:02:31.989 --> 00:02:36.610
 really soft gameplay from me and I 

00:02:34.209 --> 00:02:38.170
 I'm really not sure at all I come 

00:02:36.610 --> 00:02:39.760
 same as it is for me it's page and 

00:02:38.170 --> 00:02:41.890
 apam attributed the merit of having made a 

00:02:39.760 --> 00:02:44.410
 dna because frankly in the way 

00:02:41.890 --> 00:02:46.600
 which I'm doing it did not look like me 

00:02:44.410 --> 00:02:49.180
 let's say I wanted to go for a walk 

00:02:46.600 --> 00:02:50.440
 and anna I wanted to test a little how 

00:02:49.180 --> 00:02:52.209
 it was going to be like playing like that 

00:02:50.440 --> 00:02:53.470
 and I did not expect to do it at all 

00:02:52.209 --> 00:02:55.180
 so I realized 

00:02:53.470 --> 00:02:56.410
 playing if I played often like that 

00:02:55.180 --> 00:02:58.660
 I could have done a lot of dena 

00:02:56.410 --> 00:03:00.730
 rest assured it is really day 

00:02:58.660 --> 00:03:02.380
 limit the only time I played as 

00:03:00.730 --> 00:03:03.580
 that is to say already I reassure you 

00:03:02.380 --> 00:03:04.930
 it's the first time 

00:03:03.580 --> 00:03:06.820
 it's the first game to be told 

00:03:04.930 --> 00:03:09.010
 this warfare where I played silent 

00:03:06.820 --> 00:03:11.380
 as if by chance on a dn1 that I can 

00:03:09.010 --> 00:03:12.640
 you swear on the head of the camps I 

00:03:11.380 --> 00:03:14.320
 would also like to received and that's all have 

00:03:12.640 --> 00:03:16.510
 weapons that I pick up know a 

00:03:14.320 --> 00:03:17.410
 thing that does not play be billiards and there I 

00:03:16.510 --> 00:03:18.340
 you admit it was the first game 

00:03:17.410 --> 00:03:20.760
 I like this gentleman had nothing 

00:03:18.340 --> 00:03:23.590
 else to actually put it simply 

00:03:20.760 --> 00:03:25.269
 age berre sas is a sality line 

00:03:23.590 --> 00:03:27.010
 so on nintendo what you know 

00:03:25.269 --> 00:03:28.780
 maybe not necessarily we're going 

00:03:27.010 --> 00:03:29.890
 not put a viewfinder if the viewfinder points 

00:03:28.780 --> 00:03:31.690
 red accepted suddenly I do not have too much 

00:03:29.890 --> 00:03:33.519
 still well silent here 

00:03:31.690 --> 00:03:34.959
 anyway i did not do madonna 

00:03:33.519 --> 00:03:37.000
 than with that because after eating 

00:03:34.959 --> 00:03:40.540
 more I had more germa balls his 

00:03:37.000 --> 00:03:42.210
 dna notes and suddenly I took a cellar 

00:03:40.540 --> 00:03:43.380
 5 etc 

00:03:42.210 --> 00:03:44.760
 what is this 

00:03:43.380 --> 00:03:46.290
 approach think that already you've seen a 

00:03:44.760 --> 00:03:47.970
 little to the introduction that I blocked a 

00:03:46.290 --> 00:03:50.070
 dude because they break my balls 

00:03:47.970 --> 00:03:51.720
 actually the guy I think he was doing 

00:03:50.070 --> 00:03:54.000
 lisbon broc's express I think even 

00:03:51.720 --> 00:03:56.790
 Moreover, it was a Frenchman 

00:03:54.000 --> 00:03:59.820
 that's it I wanted to piss him off I 

00:03:56.790 --> 00:04:00.780
 just block them now 

00:03:59.820 --> 00:04:02.310
 than what you will see if you have 

00:04:00.780 --> 00:04:05.010
 just see you a gameplay at the cpm 

00:04:02.310 --> 00:04:06.180
 drinking bullshit a 

00:04:05.010 --> 00:04:08.100
 Africa and worldwide gameplay 

00:04:06.180 --> 00:04:09.720
 sequence simply because I have 

00:04:08.100 --> 00:04:10.970
 really not jumped at showing you 

00:04:09.720 --> 00:04:13.110
 uninteresting parts 

00:04:10.970 --> 00:04:14.430
 I do not know if I'm doing good of you 

00:04:13.110 --> 00:04:16.080
 do it like that anyway I hope 

00:04:14.430 --> 00:04:18.000
 that it will not bother you on the contrary 

00:04:16.080 --> 00:04:19.080
 it will perhaps please you but what 

00:04:18.000 --> 00:04:21.570
 I have a lot of things 

00:04:19.080 --> 00:04:23.190
 and can see in any case that in my d 

00:04:21.570 --> 00:04:25.280
 annaba i played a lot spawns 

00:04:23.190 --> 00:04:28.050
 even if I understand nothing it was 

00:04:25.280 --> 00:04:29.220
 already in advantage on the d3 for those who 

00:04:28.050 --> 00:04:30.660
 do not know and I 'm not enormously 

00:04:29.220 --> 00:04:33.420
 more so I did not understand them 

00:04:30.660 --> 00:04:34.650
 spawn and I do not hide that as soon as 

00:04:33.420 --> 00:04:36.480
 I did this step right after on 

00:04:34.650 --> 00:04:37.830
 skype gecol attic i said is banished 

00:04:36.480 --> 00:04:39.390
 What I did a brand name 

00:04:37.830 --> 00:04:40.890
 I blocked a guy so I do not know if 

00:04:39.390 --> 00:04:42.570
 I am going to propose on my channel us 

00:04:40.890 --> 00:04:44.850
 blow there I propose it to you because I 

00:04:42.570 --> 00:04:46.250
 you had asked if you want it if 

00:04:44.850 --> 00:04:48.720
 you want it I do not know how to make it brief 

00:04:46.250 --> 00:04:49.710
 and most of you said yes so 

00:04:48.720 --> 00:04:51.120
 here I propose it to you 

00:04:49.710 --> 00:04:53.340
 but against you the sequences and 

00:04:51.120 --> 00:04:55.650
 story all men - hognon and that's it 

00:04:53.340 --> 00:04:58.350
 it was my first last on xbox one 

00:04:55.650 --> 00:05:01.620
 at here I come to 3 and halak was 5 years old 

00:04:58.350 --> 00:05:03.390
 silent and especially to people my life 

00:05:01.620 --> 00:05:03.780
 like a big pig and I managed to get myself 

00:05:03.390 --> 00:05:06.570
 calm 

00:05:03.780 --> 00:05:07.770
 so yes I made blocking lures 

00:05:06.570 --> 00:05:09.600
 with and by the way I think I'm going 

00:05:07.770 --> 00:05:10.620
 put that as a title and frankly I 

00:05:09.600 --> 00:05:11.470
 you admit that I typed a 

00:05:10.620 --> 00:05:12.780
 small boat 

00:05:11.470 --> 00:05:15.460
 my regarding their reverse ghosting 

00:05:12.780 --> 00:05:17.110
 because I think I've already seen 

00:05:15.460 --> 00:05:20.080
 people who asked me if I did 

00:05:17.110 --> 00:05:21.760
 etc which I could make a video 

00:05:20.080 --> 00:05:23.590
 to show my stats so for 

00:05:21.760 --> 00:05:25.330
 the moment I have a single account 1 on the 

00:05:23.590 --> 00:05:27.190
 xbox one it's this contract gives exhort 

00:05:25.330 --> 00:05:29.520
 I created another account to try 

00:05:27.190 --> 00:05:32.040
 to use only in league 

00:05:29.520 --> 00:05:33.790
 I would say besides not good blaze 

00:05:32.040 --> 00:05:35.460
 by the way I did no gameplay 

00:05:33.790 --> 00:05:37.960
 still on my youtube channel 

00:05:35.460 --> 00:05:40.240
 maybe I 'll show it I 'll do 

00:05:37.960 --> 00:05:41.740
 maybe even why not a gameplay 

00:05:40.240 --> 00:05:42.670
 in league with this tale is for 

00:05:41.740 --> 00:05:44.290
 the moment it's a sneaky thing I 

00:05:42.670 --> 00:05:44.530
 prefer that it stays liquid but otherwise 

00:05:44.290 --> 00:05:46.630
 no 

00:05:44.530 --> 00:05:48.400
 here are no various pools for my 

00:05:46.630 --> 00:05:51.400
 my stats are more than the gites 

00:05:48.400 --> 00:05:53.490
 I think I have a 80.2 of horatio a 

00:05:51.400 --> 00:05:56.770
 stuff like that I have thirty thousand 

00:05:53.490 --> 00:05:59.020
 I must have 350 spm 

00:05:56.770 --> 00:06:01.090
 it seems to me thanks to the victories 

00:05:59.020 --> 00:06:03.610
 defeats of the sea by cons finally brief 

00:06:01.090 --> 00:06:05.980
 so that's an option that I have three or 

00:06:03.610 --> 00:06:06.640
 four vicious medals so I say 

00:06:05.980 --> 00:06:08.050
 no nonsense 

00:06:06.640 --> 00:06:09.100
 finally short here I was doing a little 

00:06:08.050 --> 00:06:10.830
 told but know why not in 

00:06:09.100 --> 00:06:13.030
 make a video 

00:06:10.830 --> 00:06:15.790
 next time we will see see listen 

00:06:13.030 --> 00:06:17.260
 a dish so I'm doing this really in 

00:06:15.790 --> 00:06:18.340
 solo mode besides I confess that 

00:06:17.260 --> 00:06:19.990
 sometimes it's a little broken balls of 

00:06:18.340 --> 00:06:22.060
 game with its stages because inevitably 

00:06:19.990 --> 00:06:23.560
 if really kind the matchmaking and based 

00:06:22.060 --> 00:06:24.790
 like that I really fall on 

00:06:23.560 --> 00:06:26.080
 guys who play a lot of their stats 

00:06:24.790 --> 00:06:28.120
 and it's not easy at all kind of 

00:06:26.080 --> 00:06:30.460
 guys who are ready for anything to surf 

00:06:28.120 --> 00:06:32.350
 nguema 2/3 of ratio 1 the corner are 

00:06:30.460 --> 00:06:33.850
 allowed its limits all summer 

00:06:32.350 --> 00:06:35.979
 brought back into the war so here we go 

00:06:33.850 --> 00:06:37.320
 in approach to the fonda video listen to me 

00:06:35.979 --> 00:06:39.220
 I really hope you enjoyed it 

00:06:37.320 --> 00:06:42.370
 I really hope I did not do 

00:06:39.220 --> 00:06:43.870
 nonsense we are doing these camps in 

00:06:42.370 --> 00:06:46.000
 selecting end by doing a 

00:06:43.870 --> 00:06:48.640
 selection all ashore sequences and 

00:06:46.000 --> 00:06:49.840
 Anyway, that's all for me 

00:06:48.640 --> 00:06:51.010
 wish you an excellent 

00:06:49.840 --> 00:06:52.870
 day an excellent evening 

00:06:51.010 --> 00:06:54.250
 a pallec worker that will make me super 

00:06:52.870 --> 00:06:55.570
 pleasure the real one maybe trying 

00:06:54.250 --> 00:06:56.680
 both ways for once that's true 

00:06:55.570 --> 00:06:59.350
 that right now on my channel it's not 

00:06:56.680 --> 00:07:01.210
 the top tip in terms of the likes of that 

00:06:59.350 --> 00:07:02.560
 do not bother there is an activity that's 

00:07:01.210 --> 00:07:04.000
 no matter you had something else to do 

00:07:02.560 --> 00:07:05.110
 watch videos I'd like 

00:07:04.000 --> 00:07:06.700
 try it so that's all for me 

00:07:05.110 --> 00:07:09.570
 I tell you draws people to the 

00:07:06.700 --> 00:07:09.570
 next for a video
