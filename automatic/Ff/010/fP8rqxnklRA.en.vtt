response<00:02:34.560> to<00:02:35.560> an<00:02:35.920> insane<00:02:36.400> world<00:02:36.670> or<00:02:37.630> what's

00:02:37.890 --> 00:02:37.900 
response to an insane world or what's

00:02:37.900 --> 00:02:40.319 
response to an insane world or what's
that<00:02:37.989> effect<00:02:38.470> yeah<00:02:39.040> I<00:02:39.070> wondered<00:02:39.670> if<00:02:39.760> a<00:02:39.880> that's

00:02:40.319 --> 00:02:40.329 
that effect yeah I wondered if a that's

00:02:40.329 --> 00:02:43.949 
that effect yeah I wondered if a that's
your<00:02:40.570> view<00:02:40.900> and<00:02:41.079> be<00:02:41.609> what<00:02:42.609> the<00:02:42.820> message<00:02:43.299> of<00:02:43.450> the

00:02:43.949 --> 00:02:43.959 
your view and be what the message of the

00:02:43.959 --> 00:02:46.289 
your view and be what the message of the
film<00:02:44.170> is<00:02:44.410> when<00:02:44.859> it<00:02:44.980> comes<00:02:45.280> to<00:02:45.609> the<00:02:45.730> prohibition

00:02:46.289 --> 00:02:46.299 
film is when it comes to the prohibition

00:02:46.299 --> 00:02:49.920 
film is when it comes to the prohibition
of<00:02:46.359> drugs<00:02:47.070> very<00:02:48.070> effective<00:02:48.609> that<00:02:48.760> well<00:02:49.239> the

00:02:49.920 --> 00:02:49.930 
of drugs very effective that well the

00:02:49.930 --> 00:02:51.509 
of drugs very effective that well the
the<00:02:49.959> you<00:02:50.500> know<00:02:50.620> I<00:02:50.650> speak<00:02:51.040> inside<00:02:51.370> the

00:02:51.509 --> 00:02:51.519 
the you know I speak inside the

00:02:51.519 --> 00:02:54.449 
the you know I speak inside the
character<00:02:51.940> she<00:02:52.180> says<00:02:52.420> and<00:02:52.959> sort<00:02:53.709> of<00:02:53.799> Bashan

00:02:54.449 --> 00:02:54.459 
character she says and sort of Bashan

00:02:54.459 --> 00:02:57.539 
character she says and sort of Bashan
and<00:02:54.930> drugs<00:02:55.930> to<00:02:56.440> them<00:02:56.620> the<00:02:56.829> marijuana

00:02:57.539 --> 00:02:57.549 
and drugs to them the marijuana

00:02:57.549 --> 00:02:59.580 
and drugs to them the marijuana
certainly<00:02:58.000> is<00:02:58.150> a<00:02:58.180> rational<00:02:58.780> response<00:02:59.200> to

00:02:59.580 --> 00:02:59.590 
certainly is a rational response to

00:02:59.590 --> 00:03:01.860 
certainly is a rational response to
insanity<00:02:59.890> because<00:03:00.370> he's<00:03:00.790> seen<00:03:01.060> the<00:03:01.209> iraq<00:03:01.569> wars
