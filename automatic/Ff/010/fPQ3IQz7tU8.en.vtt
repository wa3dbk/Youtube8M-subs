needless<00:00:26.099> to<00:00:26.130> say<00:00:26.220> I<00:00:26.400> was<00:00:26.580> pretty<00:00:26.760> thrilled

00:00:27.140 --> 00:00:27.150 
needless to say I was pretty thrilled

00:00:27.150 --> 00:00:28.400 
needless to say I was pretty thrilled
about<00:00:27.359> getting<00:00:27.570> the<00:00:27.630> opportunity<00:00:28.140> to<00:00:28.170> face

00:00:28.400 --> 00:00:28.410 
about getting the opportunity to face

00:00:28.410 --> 00:00:29.779

him again and try and get some revenge

00:00:29.789 --> 00:00:31.550 
him again and try and get some revenge
the<00:00:30.630> army<00:00:30.900> he<00:00:30.990> brings<00:00:31.260> though<00:00:31.439> is

00:00:31.550 --> 00:00:31.560 
the army he brings though is

00:00:31.560 --> 00:00:33.709 
the army he brings though is
extraordinarily<00:00:31.980> strange<00:00:32.850> you<00:00:33.300> can<00:00:33.420> see<00:00:33.570> that

00:00:33.709 --> 00:00:33.719 
extraordinarily strange you can see that

00:00:33.719 --> 00:00:35.720 
extraordinarily strange you can see that
he's<00:00:33.809> got<00:00:33.930> five<00:00:33.989> history--and<00:00:34.890> three<00:00:35.250> sake<00:00:35.579> I

00:00:35.720 --> 00:00:35.730 
he's got five history--and three sake I

00:00:35.730 --> 00:00:38.959 
he's got five history--and three sake I
missed<00:00:36.660> Adi<00:00:36.870> or<00:00:37.620> whatever<00:00:37.860> they<00:00:37.980> are<00:00:38.010> and<00:00:38.489> a

00:00:38.959 --> 00:00:38.969 
missed Adi or whatever they are and a

00:00:38.969 --> 00:00:40.549 
missed Adi or whatever they are and a
couple<00:00:39.210> of<00:00:39.329> Romans<00:00:39.600> scorpions<00:00:40.079> which<00:00:40.290> though

00:00:40.549 --> 00:00:40.559 
couple of Romans scorpions which though

00:00:40.559 --> 00:00:42.080 
couple of Romans scorpions which though
is<00:00:40.680> actually<00:00:40.980> kind<00:00:41.160> of<00:00:41.219> halfway<00:00:41.399> makes<00:00:41.790> sense

00:00:42.080 --> 00:00:42.090 
is actually kind of halfway makes sense

00:00:42.090 --> 00:00:45.260 
is actually kind of halfway makes sense
but<00:00:42.809> all<00:00:43.590> the<00:00:43.739> history--<00:00:44.129> no<00:00:44.460> idea<00:00:44.789> what's<00:00:45.030> up

00:00:45.260 --> 00:00:45.270 
but all the history-- no idea what's up

00:00:45.270 --> 00:00:47.450 
but all the history-- no idea what's up
with<00:00:45.420> that<00:00:45.450> I<00:00:45.870> mean<00:00:46.379> it<00:00:46.620> is<00:00:46.739> cheap<00:00:46.950> infantry

00:00:47.450 --> 00:00:47.460 
with that I mean it is cheap infantry

00:00:47.460 --> 00:00:48.500 
with that I mean it is cheap infantry
and<00:00:47.579> the<00:00:47.640> Sun<00:00:47.910> II<00:00:47.940> wouldn't<00:00:48.149> have<00:00:48.210> any<00:00:48.390> trouble

00:00:48.500 --> 00:00:48.510 
and the Sun II wouldn't have any trouble

00:00:48.510 --> 00:00:50.930 
and the Sun II wouldn't have any trouble
cutting<00:00:48.870> down<00:00:49.079> my<00:00:49.289> late<00:00:49.469> Libyan<00:00:49.800> hoplites<00:00:50.219> but

00:00:50.930 --> 00:00:50.940 
cutting down my late Libyan hoplites but

00:00:50.940 --> 00:00:52.279 
cutting down my late Libyan hoplites but
his<00:00:51.360> thought<00:00:51.719> you're<00:00:51.899> gonna<00:00:51.989> have<00:00:52.230> an

00:00:52.279 --> 00:00:52.289 
his thought you're gonna have an

00:00:52.289 --> 00:00:54.110 
his thought you're gonna have an
extraordinarily<00:00:52.649> difficult<00:00:53.219> time<00:00:53.760> dealing

00:00:54.110 --> 00:00:54.120 
extraordinarily difficult time dealing

00:00:54.120 --> 00:00:56.360 
extraordinarily difficult time dealing
with<00:00:54.239> my<00:00:54.449> African<00:00:54.570> war<00:00:55.020> elephants<00:00:55.440> and<00:00:56.100> I've

00:00:56.360 --> 00:00:56.370 
with my African war elephants and I've

00:00:56.370 --> 00:00:58.400 
with my African war elephants and I've
also<00:00:56.579> brought<00:00:56.879> more<00:00:57.600> noble<00:00:57.930> calves<00:00:58.109> this<00:00:58.260> time

00:00:58.400 --> 00:00:58.410 
also brought more noble calves this time

00:00:58.410 --> 00:01:00.830 
also brought more noble calves this time
so<00:00:58.530> I<00:00:58.559> have<00:00:58.649> two<00:00:58.829> noble<00:00:59.160> keV<00:00:59.340> two<00:01:00.149> Carthaginian

00:01:00.830 --> 00:01:00.840 
so I have two noble keV two Carthaginian

00:01:00.840 --> 00:01:03.290 
so I have two noble keV two Carthaginian
there<00:01:01.079> are<00:01:01.170> three<00:01:01.469> Carthaginian<00:01:02.129> or<00:01:02.520> no<00:01:02.940> two

00:01:03.290 --> 00:01:03.300 
there are three Carthaginian or no two

00:01:03.300 --> 00:01:05.899 
there are three Carthaginian or no two
Carthaginian<00:01:03.840> Cavan<00:01:04.320> two<00:01:04.589> mercenary<00:01:05.339> Iberian

00:01:05.899 --> 00:01:05.909 
Carthaginian Cavan two mercenary Iberian

00:01:05.909 --> 00:01:07.429 
Carthaginian Cavan two mercenary Iberian
calves<00:01:06.119> so<00:01:06.150> I've<00:01:06.420> come<00:01:06.570> much<00:01:06.780> more<00:01:06.810> cab<00:01:07.200> heavy

00:01:07.429 --> 00:01:07.439 
calves so I've come much more cab heavy

00:01:07.439 --> 00:01:09.649 
calves so I've come much more cab heavy
and<00:01:07.950> basically<00:01:08.790> my<00:01:08.909> idea<00:01:08.939> was<00:01:09.299> I<00:01:09.360> didn't<00:01:09.540> bring

00:01:09.649 --> 00:01:09.659 
and basically my idea was I didn't bring

00:01:09.659 --> 00:01:11.000 
and basically my idea was I didn't bring
any<00:01:09.840> Libyan<00:01:10.140> infantry<00:01:10.500> thinking<00:01:10.830> that<00:01:10.920> my

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:11.010 
any Libyan infantry thinking that my

00:01:11.010 --> 00:01:13.010 
any Libyan infantry thinking that my
calves<00:01:11.250> could<00:01:11.580> do<00:01:11.700> the<00:01:11.820> killing<00:01:12.180> and<00:01:12.360> my

00:01:13.010 --> 00:01:13.020 
calves could do the killing and my

00:01:13.020 --> 00:01:14.840 
calves could do the killing and my
Libyan<00:01:13.229> infantry<00:01:13.710> can<00:01:13.920> do<00:01:14.040> or<00:01:14.310> my<00:01:14.520> Libyan

00:01:14.840 --> 00:01:14.850 
Libyan infantry can do or my Libyan

00:01:14.850 --> 00:01:16.340 
Libyan infantry can do or my Libyan
hoplites<00:01:15.450> can<00:01:15.630> do<00:01:15.689> the<00:01:15.810> whole<00:01:15.960> thing<00:01:16.110> I<00:01:16.200> didn't

00:01:16.340 --> 00:01:16.350 
hoplites can do the whole thing I didn't

00:01:16.350 --> 00:01:19.520 
hoplites can do the whole thing I didn't
bring<00:01:16.380> any<00:01:16.619> Libyan<00:01:16.920> sword<00:01:17.340> in<00:01:17.610> an<00:01:17.729> injury<00:01:18.530> so

00:01:19.520 --> 00:01:19.530 
bring any Libyan sword in an injury so

00:01:19.530 --> 00:01:20.960 
bring any Libyan sword in an injury so
my<00:01:19.799> idea<00:01:20.009> was<00:01:20.130> I<00:01:20.189> was<00:01:20.280> gonna<00:01:20.340> do<00:01:20.520> the<00:01:20.610> killing

00:01:20.960 --> 00:01:20.970 
my idea was I was gonna do the killing

00:01:20.970 --> 00:01:24.200 
my idea was I was gonna do the killing
with<00:01:21.330> my<00:01:21.600> cavalry<00:01:22.290> and<00:01:22.680> I<00:01:23.250> have<00:01:23.460> javelins<00:01:24.030> to

00:01:24.200 --> 00:01:24.210 
with my cavalry and I have javelins to

00:01:24.210 --> 00:01:25.670 
with my cavalry and I have javelins to
stop<00:01:24.420> elephants<00:01:24.900> in<00:01:24.990> case<00:01:25.170> he<00:01:25.290> brought<00:01:25.500> them

00:01:25.670 --> 00:01:25.680 
stop elephants in case he brought them

00:01:25.680 --> 00:01:27.350 
stop elephants in case he brought them

so I decided that maybe I should come
pay<00:04:49.039> him<00:04:49.130> a<00:04:49.190> visit<00:04:49.699> unfortunately<00:04:50.479> for<00:04:50.570> them

00:04:50.710 --> 00:04:50.720 
pay him a visit unfortunately for them

00:04:50.720 --> 00:04:52.150 
pay him a visit unfortunately for them
though<00:04:50.840> my<00:04:50.960> guys<00:04:51.110> are<00:04:51.259> exhausted<00:04:51.500> so<00:04:51.949> it'll<00:04:52.100> be

00:04:52.150 --> 00:04:52.160 
though my guys are exhausted so it'll be

00:04:52.160 --> 00:04:55.210 
though my guys are exhausted so it'll be
a<00:04:52.190> slightly<00:04:52.460> less<00:04:52.699> painful<00:04:52.880> charge<00:04:53.330> and<00:04:54.220> so

00:04:55.210 --> 00:04:55.220 
a slightly less painful charge and so

00:04:55.220 --> 00:04:56.860 
a slightly less painful charge and so
