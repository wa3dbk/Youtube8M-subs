00:00:00.130 --> 00:00:06.130
 good again I bring you this time a 

00:00:02.770 --> 00:00:07.790
 video of my th lv8 the buy last name 

00:00:06.130 --> 00:00:10.070
 three months 

00:00:07.790 --> 00:00:12.469
 this video is mainly so that 

00:00:10.070 --> 00:00:13.879
 let's see how the mobile phone has aged and 

00:00:12.469 --> 00:00:15.680
 to see the qualities you could not put 

00:00:13.879 --> 00:00:18.480
 3 months all the mobile phones presented 

00:00:15.680 --> 00:00:22.560
 they begin to present 

00:00:18.480 --> 00:00:24.420
 wear well then in this case I'm 

00:00:22.560 --> 00:00:26.460
 happy because as you can see the 

00:00:24.420 --> 00:00:28.880
 housing is not marked or anything about 

00:00:26.460 --> 00:00:28.880
 how often 

00:00:29.560 --> 00:00:35.390
 and normal every day 

00:00:32.450 --> 00:00:37.520
 I use it to record scenes on a bike 

00:00:35.390 --> 00:00:39.560
 mountain bike 

00:00:37.520 --> 00:00:41.510
 to run so that the kilometers and 

00:00:39.560 --> 00:00:43.370
 that and the only thing that is good has been 

00:00:41.510 --> 00:00:45.410
 deteriorated in the housing the cover of 

00:00:43.370 --> 00:00:48.079
 state 

00:00:45.410 --> 00:00:50.720
 drinking cap is dirty and leather 

00:00:48.079 --> 00:00:53.180
 in the tissue is wrong and that's why 

00:00:50.720 --> 00:00:55.340
 working but well this is worth three 

00:00:53.180 --> 00:00:56.680
 dollars do not worry me and it's normal 

00:00:55.340 --> 00:00:58.570
 of use 

00:00:56.680 --> 00:01:01.510
 I have not brought it with another sleeve only 

00:00:58.570 --> 00:01:04.150
 It seems to me more than enough and 

00:01:01.510 --> 00:01:06.970
 Well, you can only see some scratches on 

00:01:04.150 --> 00:01:11.250
 the screen but protest the screen 

00:01:06.970 --> 00:01:11.250
 I do not care and good 

00:01:14.140 --> 00:01:21.040
 I keep using the go the one that is very 

00:01:17.210 --> 00:01:21.040
 well the graphic environment is very nice 

00:01:23.190 --> 00:01:27.650
 I have passed 

00:01:28.240 --> 00:01:30.900
 it should be 

00:01:32.909 --> 00:01:37.230
 the screen looks very good I do not have 

00:01:35.179 --> 00:01:39.470
 problems 

00:01:37.230 --> 00:01:42.070
 in any kind 

00:01:39.470 --> 00:01:42.070
 by the mobile 

00:01:42.760 --> 00:01:47.190
 coverage very well also means 

00:01:45.700 --> 00:01:50.210
 I live 

00:01:47.190 --> 00:01:53.390
 a town and I do not have any 

00:01:50.210 --> 00:01:55.820
 and now we see two 32 gb cards 

00:01:53.390 --> 00:01:58.060
 but it 's class 6 because it's the one that had 

00:01:55.820 --> 00:02:00.560
 at home and I do not have any problems 

00:01:58.060 --> 00:02:04.670
 it works perfectly does not slow me down 

00:02:00.560 --> 00:02:07.560
 nothing so that's how it's going to stay 

00:02:04.670 --> 00:02:09.750
 the photos you already know is fine 

00:02:07.560 --> 00:02:11.910
 we are sounding good even though 

00:02:09.750 --> 00:02:13.650
 I always have a volume before my head 

00:02:11.910 --> 00:02:17.120
 of the handset has not developed any 

00:02:13.650 --> 00:02:19.580
 type of game or anything so it's fine 

00:02:17.120 --> 00:02:21.440
 and nothing was simply because for 

00:02:19.580 --> 00:02:23.870
 tell you that I am very happy with the 

00:02:21.440 --> 00:02:26.209
 mobile I recommend buying the truth 

00:02:23.870 --> 00:02:27.769
 now it can be found for 140 euros 

00:02:26.209 --> 00:02:29.980
 the battery keeps giving me the days 

00:02:27.769 --> 00:02:34.170
 after three months 

00:02:29.980 --> 00:02:34.170
 and I think it's mobile 

00:02:34.569 --> 00:02:39.990
 there are four cheaper colors but 

00:02:38.499 --> 00:02:41.760
 one 

00:02:39.990 --> 00:02:43.620
 At least this one we know works 

00:02:41.760 --> 00:02:47.069
 well it has a pretty good this in 

00:02:43.620 --> 00:02:49.409
 this case has the gravity moto2 

00:02:47.069 --> 00:02:52.380
 what is the rom that has developed 

00:02:49.409 --> 00:02:55.610
 the companions and it goes really well 

00:02:52.380 --> 00:02:55.610
 and I hope you like it 

00:02:56.750 --> 00:03:00.140
 come a greeting
