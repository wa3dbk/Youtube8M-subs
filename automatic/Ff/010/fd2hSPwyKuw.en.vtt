cheap plastic and scratches easily takes

00:01:29.220 --> 00:01:32.210 
cheap plastic and scratches easily takes
fingerprint<00:01:29.820> seriously<00:01:30.240> so<00:01:31.020> it's<00:01:31.170> not<00:01:31.409> not<00:01:32.070> so

00:01:32.210 --> 00:01:32.220 
fingerprint seriously so it's not not so

00:01:32.220 --> 00:01:35.060 
fingerprint seriously so it's not not so
good<00:01:32.540> goes<00:01:33.540> for<00:01:33.780> the<00:01:33.869> arc<00:01:34.020> tool<00:01:34.290> by<00:01:34.860> the<00:01:34.920> way

00:01:35.060 --> 00:01:35.070 
good goes for the arc tool by the way

00:01:35.070 --> 00:01:43.070 
good goes for the arc tool by the way
but<00:01:38.420> the<00:01:39.420> arc<00:01:39.630> looks<00:01:39.930> nicer

00:01:43.070 --> 00:01:43.080 

00:01:43.080 --> 00:01:45.840

00:01:45.840 --> 00:01:45.850 
nexus s doesn't both phones are made of

00:01:45.850 --> 00:01:49.940 
nexus s doesn't both phones are made of
plastic<00:01:46.240> soda<00:01:46.450> build<00:01:46.690> qualities<00:01:47.909> well

00:01:49.940 --> 00:01:49.950 
plastic soda build qualities well

00:01:49.950 --> 00:01:54.990 
plastic soda build qualities well
doesn't<00:01:50.950> mean<00:01:51.250> a<00:01:51.280> bad<00:01:51.520> build<00:01:51.729> quality<00:01:54.000> of

00:01:54.990 --> 00:01:55.000 
doesn't mean a bad build quality of

00:01:55.000 --> 00:01:57.920 
doesn't mean a bad build quality of
course<00:01:55.360> but<00:01:55.600> in<00:01:56.080> this<00:01:56.200> case<00:01:56.410> it<00:01:56.680> does<00:01:56.890> and

00:01:57.920 --> 00:01:57.930 
course but in this case it does and

00:01:57.930 --> 00:02:01.980 
course but in this case it does and
Nexus<00:01:58.930> S<00:01:59.640> feels<00:02:00.640> a<00:02:00.910> bit<00:02:01.150> more<00:02:01.330> solid<00:02:01.750> maybe

00:02:01.980 --> 00:02:01.990 
Nexus S feels a bit more solid maybe

00:02:01.990 --> 00:02:07.469 
Nexus S feels a bit more solid maybe
laughter<00:02:03.570> they're<00:02:04.570> both<00:02:05.729> bit<00:02:06.729> flimsy<00:02:07.240> and

00:02:07.469 --> 00:02:07.479 
laughter they're both bit flimsy and

00:02:07.479 --> 00:02:13.949 
laughter they're both bit flimsy and
freaky<00:02:09.869> so<00:02:12.150> difference<00:02:13.150> is<00:02:13.270> not<00:02:13.420> that<00:02:13.570> baking

00:02:13.949 --> 00:02:13.959 
freaky so difference is not that baking

00:02:13.959 --> 00:02:18.740 
freaky so difference is not that baking
build<00:02:14.140> quality<00:02:14.290> but<00:02:14.920> let's<00:02:15.610> design<00:02:16.060> arc<00:02:16.870> wins

00:02:38.990 --> 00:02:39.000 

00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:57.950 

the<00:02:40.000> arc<00:02:40.209> is<00:02:40.390> probably<00:02:42.660> the<00:02:43.660> better<00:02:43.840> one

00:02:57.950 --> 00:02:57.960 

00:02:57.960 --> 00:03:00.570 

as<00:02:58.960> you<00:02:59.080> can<00:02:59.230> see<00:02:59.410> from<00:02:59.590> this<00:02:59.770> compression<00:03:00.220> the

00:03:00.570 --> 00:03:00.580 
as you can see from this compression the

00:03:00.580 --> 00:03:05.370 
as you can see from this compression the
arcus<00:03:01.980> better<00:03:02.980> colors<00:03:03.430> I'm<00:03:04.060> realistic<00:03:04.540> a<00:03:04.960> bit

00:03:05.370 --> 00:03:05.380 
arcus better colors I'm realistic a bit

00:03:05.380 --> 00:03:10.020 
arcus better colors I'm realistic a bit
warmer<00:03:07.410> so<00:03:08.410> that<00:03:08.590> makes<00:03:08.770> the<00:03:08.950> arc<00:03:09.220> look<00:03:09.790> nicer

00:03:10.020 --> 00:03:10.030 
warmer so that makes the arc look nicer

00:03:10.030 --> 00:03:20.340 
warmer so that makes the arc look nicer
the<00:03:10.990> next<00:03:11.230> is<00:03:11.710> a<00:03:11.760> bit<00:03:12.760> cold<00:03:13.150> and<00:03:14.190> also<00:03:19.230> looks<00:03:20.230> to

00:03:20.340 --> 00:03:20.350 
the next is a bit cold and also looks to

00:03:20.350 --> 00:03:26.610 
the next is a bit cold and also looks to
be<00:03:20.470> a<00:03:20.760> little<00:03:21.810> less<00:03:22.810> sharp<00:03:25.230> next<00:03:26.230> this<00:03:26.440> is<00:03:26.590> a

00:03:26.610 --> 00:03:26.620 
be a little less sharp next this is a

00:03:26.620 --> 00:03:30.180 
be a little less sharp next this is a
bit<00:03:26.800> brighter<00:03:27.100> though<00:03:27.370> as<00:03:27.610> you<00:03:27.760> can<00:03:27.940> see<00:03:29.190> but

00:03:30.180 --> 00:03:30.190 
bit brighter though as you can see but

00:03:30.190 --> 00:03:34.250 
bit brighter though as you can see but
they<00:03:30.610> are<00:03:30.670> both<00:03:30.820> very<00:03:31.030> good<00:03:31.270> screens<00:03:32.160> you<00:03:33.160> know

00:03:34.250 --> 00:03:34.260 
they are both very good screens you know

00:03:34.260 --> 00:03:40.950 
they are both very good screens you know
it's<00:03:35.260> not<00:03:35.410> a<00:03:35.470> deal<00:03:35.650> breaker<00:03:36.660> anyway<00:03:39.960> both

00:03:40.950 --> 00:03:40.960 
it's not a deal breaker anyway both
