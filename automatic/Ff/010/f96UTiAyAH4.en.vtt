00:00:02.750 --> 00:00:02.760 
hi this is Yolanda Vanveen and in this

00:00:02.760 --> 00:00:04.670 
hi this is Yolanda Vanveen and in this
segment<00:00:03.090> we're<00:00:03.389> going<00:00:03.419> to<00:00:03.540> talk<00:00:03.629> about<00:00:03.929> how<00:00:04.620> to

00:00:04.670 --> 00:00:04.680 
segment we're going to talk about how to

00:00:04.680 --> 00:00:09.020 
segment we're going to talk about how to
winterize<00:00:05.279> your<00:00:05.790> garden<00:00:06.950> so<00:00:07.950> it's<00:00:08.220> December

00:00:09.020 --> 00:00:09.030 
winterize your garden so it's December

00:00:09.030 --> 00:00:11.810 
winterize your garden so it's December
and<00:00:09.300> my<00:00:09.750> dollies<00:00:10.320> have<00:00:10.590> finally<00:00:11.280> died<00:00:11.550> back

00:00:11.810 --> 00:00:11.820 
and my dollies have finally died back

00:00:11.820 --> 00:00:14.600 
and my dollies have finally died back
we've<00:00:12.090> had<00:00:12.300> a<00:00:12.330> few<00:00:12.599> freezing<00:00:13.200> nights<00:00:13.469> and<00:00:13.889> I've

00:00:14.600 --> 00:00:14.610 
we've had a few freezing nights and I've

00:00:14.610 --> 00:00:17.000 
we've had a few freezing nights and I've
had<00:00:14.820> blooms<00:00:15.089> up<00:00:15.360> until<00:00:15.990> last<00:00:16.230> week<00:00:16.590> on<00:00:16.800> them

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:17.010 
had blooms up until last week on them

00:00:17.010 --> 00:00:19.429 
had blooms up until last week on them
here<00:00:17.279> in<00:00:17.340> the<00:00:17.430> northwest<00:00:17.910> and<00:00:18.300> so<00:00:19.020> it's<00:00:19.199> time

00:00:19.429 --> 00:00:19.439 
here in the northwest and so it's time

00:00:19.439 --> 00:00:22.220 
here in the northwest and so it's time
to<00:00:19.470> rent<00:00:19.800> arise<00:00:20.039> my<00:00:20.340> garden<00:00:20.789> so<00:00:21.539> basically<00:00:22.199> my

00:00:22.220 --> 00:00:22.230 
to rent arise my garden so basically my

00:00:22.230 --> 00:00:24.259 
to rent arise my garden so basically my
theory<00:00:22.920> is<00:00:22.949> as<00:00:23.250> long<00:00:23.430> as<00:00:23.580> something's<00:00:23.939> green

00:00:24.259 --> 00:00:24.269 
theory is as long as something's green

00:00:24.269 --> 00:00:25.849 
theory is as long as something's green
you<00:00:24.510> leave<00:00:24.689> it<00:00:24.869> be<00:00:25.050> as<00:00:25.230> soon<00:00:25.410> as<00:00:25.560> it<00:00:25.680> turns

00:00:25.849 --> 00:00:25.859 
you leave it be as soon as it turns

00:00:25.859 --> 00:00:28.640 
you leave it be as soon as it turns
brown<00:00:26.369> you<00:00:26.820> cut<00:00:27.000> it<00:00:27.119> out<00:00:27.210> or<00:00:27.449> let<00:00:28.050> it<00:00:28.080> die<00:00:28.349> back

00:00:28.640 --> 00:00:28.650 
brown you cut it out or let it die back

00:00:28.650 --> 00:00:31.460 
brown you cut it out or let it die back
and<00:00:29.070> use<00:00:29.580> it<00:00:29.730> for<00:00:29.910> mulch<00:00:30.119> so<00:00:30.929> right<00:00:31.109> here<00:00:31.140> on

00:00:31.460 --> 00:00:31.470 
and use it for mulch so right here on

00:00:31.470 --> 00:00:33.400 
and use it for mulch so right here on
these<00:00:31.619> dahlias<00:00:32.189> i'm<00:00:32.460> just<00:00:32.790> going<00:00:33.090> to<00:00:33.180> either

00:00:33.400 --> 00:00:33.410 
these dahlias i'm just going to either

00:00:33.410 --> 00:00:35.750 
these dahlias i'm just going to either
stomp<00:00:34.410> them<00:00:34.649> down<00:00:34.860> that's<00:00:35.190> the<00:00:35.280> easy<00:00:35.460> way<00:00:35.700> to

00:00:35.750 --> 00:00:35.760 
stomp them down that's the easy way to

00:00:35.760 --> 00:00:37.610 
stomp them down that's the easy way to
do<00:00:36.059> it<00:00:36.239> or<00:00:36.510> you<00:00:36.660> can<00:00:36.809> cut<00:00:37.050> them<00:00:37.140> down<00:00:37.200> one<00:00:37.590> by

00:00:37.610 --> 00:00:37.620 
do it or you can cut them down one by

00:00:37.620 --> 00:00:39.920 
do it or you can cut them down one by
one<00:00:38.010> but<00:00:38.850> i<00:00:38.879> found<00:00:39.180> this<00:00:39.329> works<00:00:39.570> really<00:00:39.780> well

00:00:39.920 --> 00:00:39.930 
one but i found this works really well

00:00:39.930 --> 00:00:42.560 
one but i found this works really well
and<00:00:40.410> i'll<00:00:40.860> just<00:00:41.100> bring<00:00:41.370> them<00:00:41.550> all<00:00:41.820> down<00:00:41.850> and

00:00:42.560 --> 00:00:42.570 
and i'll just bring them all down and

00:00:42.570 --> 00:00:45.380 
and i'll just bring them all down and
they're<00:00:42.780> going<00:00:43.020> to<00:00:43.140> mulch<00:00:43.649> themselves<00:00:44.610> so<00:00:45.210> my

00:00:45.380 --> 00:00:45.390 
they're going to mulch themselves so my

00:00:45.390 --> 00:00:47.720 
they're going to mulch themselves so my
theory<00:00:45.719> and<00:00:45.930> my<00:00:46.020> big<00:00:46.260> flower<00:00:46.500> beds<00:00:46.890> is<00:00:47.190> i<00:00:47.489> like

00:00:47.720 --> 00:00:47.730 
theory and my big flower beds is i like

00:00:47.730 --> 00:00:49.850 
theory and my big flower beds is i like
to<00:00:47.910> use<00:00:47.940> the<00:00:48.270> greenery<00:00:48.660> on<00:00:48.690> the<00:00:49.110> same<00:00:49.559> plans

00:00:49.850 --> 00:00:49.860 
to use the greenery on the same plans

00:00:49.860 --> 00:00:52.100 
to use the greenery on the same plans
and<00:00:50.280> a<00:00:50.309> lot<00:00:50.969> of<00:00:51.090> times<00:00:51.239> just<00:00:51.329> putting<00:00:51.719> a<00:00:51.840> layer

00:00:52.100 --> 00:00:52.110 
and a lot of times just putting a layer

00:00:52.110 --> 00:00:55.279 
and a lot of times just putting a layer
of<00:00:52.410> leaves<00:00:53.250> over<00:00:53.820> everything<00:00:54.329> to<00:00:54.629> mulch<00:00:55.020> um

00:00:55.279 --> 00:00:55.289 
of leaves over everything to mulch um

00:00:55.289 --> 00:00:57.770 
of leaves over everything to mulch um
protects<00:00:55.710> them<00:00:55.949> as<00:00:56.100> well<00:00:56.340> and<00:00:56.699> the<00:00:57.480> winner<00:00:57.660> is

00:00:57.770 --> 00:00:57.780 
protects them as well and the winner is

00:00:57.780 --> 00:00:59.990 
protects them as well and the winner is
a<00:00:57.989> great<00:00:58.289> time<00:00:58.500> to<00:00:58.559> move<00:00:58.920> things<00:00:59.190> around<00:00:59.430> too

00:00:59.990 --> 00:01:00.000 
a great time to move things around too

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:02.479 
a great time to move things around too
so<00:01:00.600> I'm<00:01:00.660> always<00:01:00.840> trimming<00:01:01.440> plants<00:01:01.680> and<00:01:02.219> moving

00:01:02.479 --> 00:01:02.489 
so I'm always trimming plants and moving

00:01:02.489 --> 00:01:04.429 
so I'm always trimming plants and moving
them<00:01:02.609> to<00:01:02.670> different<00:01:03.030> areas<00:01:03.329> and<00:01:03.899> if<00:01:04.290> you've

00:01:04.429 --> 00:01:04.439 
them to different areas and if you've

00:01:04.439 --> 00:01:06.800 
them to different areas and if you've
got<00:01:04.650> plants<00:01:05.100> that<00:01:05.339> are<00:01:05.519> too<00:01:06.150> big<00:01:06.180> for<00:01:06.689> that

00:01:06.800 --> 00:01:06.810 
got plants that are too big for that

00:01:06.810 --> 00:01:08.960 
got plants that are too big for that
flower<00:01:07.080> bed<00:01:07.409> the<00:01:07.770> wintertime<00:01:08.520> is<00:01:08.640> a<00:01:08.700> great

00:01:08.960 --> 00:01:08.970 
flower bed the wintertime is a great

00:01:08.970 --> 00:01:11.810 
flower bed the wintertime is a great
time<00:01:09.270> to<00:01:09.510> move<00:01:09.720> them<00:01:10.080> and<00:01:10.350> any<00:01:11.130> plants<00:01:11.640> that

00:01:11.810 --> 00:01:11.820 
time to move them and any plants that

00:01:11.820 --> 00:01:14.560 
time to move them and any plants that
aren't<00:01:12.119> quite<00:01:12.330> winter<00:01:12.720> hardy<00:01:13.170> like<00:01:13.890> my

00:01:14.560 --> 00:01:14.570 
aren't quite winter hardy like my

00:01:14.570 --> 00:01:19.490 
aren't quite winter hardy like my
fuchsia<00:01:15.570> or<00:01:16.110> my<00:01:16.320> geraniums<00:01:16.640> or<00:01:17.640> I've<00:01:18.000> got<00:01:18.500> some

00:01:19.490 --> 00:01:19.500 
fuchsia or my geraniums or I've got some

00:01:19.500 --> 00:01:21.499 
fuchsia or my geraniums or I've got some
different<00:01:20.189> plants<00:01:20.610> that<00:01:20.820> might<00:01:21.030> not<00:01:21.210> make<00:01:21.450> it

00:01:21.499 --> 00:01:21.509 
different plants that might not make it

00:01:21.509 --> 00:01:23.390 
different plants that might not make it
outside<00:01:22.200> I'll<00:01:22.680> throw<00:01:23.100> them<00:01:23.250> in<00:01:23.310> the

00:01:23.390 --> 00:01:23.400 
outside I'll throw them in the

00:01:23.400 --> 00:01:27.020 
outside I'll throw them in the
greenhouse<00:01:23.909> or<00:01:24.299> my<00:01:24.869> mandevilla<00:01:25.500> that<00:01:26.189> will

00:01:27.020 --> 00:01:27.030 
greenhouse or my mandevilla that will

00:01:27.030 --> 00:01:28.760 
greenhouse or my mandevilla that will
not<00:01:27.210> make<00:01:27.450> it<00:01:27.600> outside<00:01:27.930> or<00:01:27.990> probably<00:01:28.350> even<00:01:28.500> in

00:01:28.760 --> 00:01:28.770 
not make it outside or probably even in

00:01:28.770 --> 00:01:31.010 
not make it outside or probably even in
the<00:01:28.829> greenhouse<00:01:29.310> it's<00:01:29.970> in<00:01:30.210> my<00:01:30.240> laundry<00:01:30.570> room

00:01:31.010 --> 00:01:31.020

00:01:32.780 --> 00:01:32.790 
so I bring all the plants that are

00:01:32.790 --> 00:01:35.600 
so I bring all the plants that are
tender<00:01:33.360> into<00:01:34.079> the<00:01:34.229> house<00:01:34.409> and<00:01:34.740> any<00:01:34.979> bulbs<00:01:35.340> that

00:01:40.460 --> 00:01:40.470 
store them in crates or in paper boxes

00:01:40.470 --> 00:01:42.920 
store them in crates or in paper boxes
or<00:01:40.740> right<00:01:40.979> into<00:01:41.310> newspapers<00:01:42.000> and<00:01:42.270> turn<00:01:42.810> around

00:01:42.920 --> 00:01:42.930 
or right into newspapers and turn around

00:01:42.930 --> 00:01:45.530 
or right into newspapers and turn around
and<00:01:43.259> plant<00:01:43.470> them<00:01:43.560> in<00:01:43.680> the<00:01:43.829> spring<00:01:44.220> so<00:01:45.180> the

00:01:45.530 --> 00:01:45.540 
and plant them in the spring so the

00:01:45.540 --> 00:01:48.050 
and plant them in the spring so the
wintertime<00:01:45.720> is<00:01:46.439> an<00:01:46.619> easy<00:01:46.920> time<00:01:47.250> to<00:01:47.729> winterize

00:01:48.050 --> 00:01:48.060 
wintertime is an easy time to winterize
