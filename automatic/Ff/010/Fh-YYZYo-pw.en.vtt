00:00:05.460 --> 00:00:09.309
 Hi, how are you talking to them? 

00:00:07.450 --> 00:00:12.309
 Carlos, let's continue with this course 

00:00:09.309 --> 00:00:14.709
 of cinema 4d in its version r 15 

00:00:12.309 --> 00:00:16.420
 in this chapter we are going to see we are going to 

00:00:14.709 --> 00:00:18.280
 continue to see the esplais on the 

00:00:16.420 --> 00:00:21.189
 primitive Spanish in this case we are going to 

00:00:18.280 --> 00:00:23.320
 see the star the star as we see 

00:00:21.189 --> 00:00:26.230
 we change the frontal mode but we have 

00:00:23.320 --> 00:00:27.279
 a series of points or peaks that we 

00:00:26.230 --> 00:00:29.470
 we will be able to configure here by 

00:00:27.279 --> 00:00:31.380
 example we have the internal radio so 

00:00:29.470 --> 00:00:35.110
 basically it has to do with this part 

00:00:31.380 --> 00:00:37.960
 we can increase it decrease the radius 

00:00:35.110 --> 00:00:39.580
 externally obviously screw that what 

00:00:37.960 --> 00:00:42.790
 what it does is move what is the origin not 

00:00:39.580 --> 00:00:45.400
 that there is an Oscar and the tips are 

00:00:42.790 --> 00:00:46.930
 as united we must have the world. 

00:00:45.400 --> 00:00:48.700
 it's something important because it generates 8 

00:00:46.930 --> 00:00:51.400
 can you increase it describe the three 

00:00:48.700 --> 00:00:52.900
 points that is the minimum we have the plane 

00:00:51.400 --> 00:00:55.170
 It is obviously the plane on which 

00:00:52.900 --> 00:00:58.510
 is going to run remember we have here 

00:00:55.170 --> 00:01:00.430
 invest that here again you do not notice 

00:00:58.510 --> 00:01:03.580
 when seconds we activate it or not because 

00:01:00.430 --> 00:01:05.560
 have to see that you are not going to see is 

00:01:03.580 --> 00:01:07.390
 utility when we for example 

00:01:05.560 --> 00:01:09.730
 we use this figure or this spline 

00:01:07.390 --> 00:01:11.350
 to make a trajectory of movement 

00:01:09.730 --> 00:01:13.150
 if we use for example 

00:01:11.350 --> 00:01:14.619
 its origin will be to be in that position 

00:01:13.150 --> 00:01:17.560
 and we invest what you do that is going to be 

00:01:14.619 --> 00:01:18.880
 upside down then it's not good this is going to 

00:01:17.560 --> 00:01:21.369
 make sense when we do the 

00:01:18.880 --> 00:01:24.190
 Intermediate points animation by 

00:01:21.369 --> 00:01:26.590
 remember that is how they are going to 

00:01:24.190 --> 00:01:30.640
 adapt those points in straight lines 

00:01:26.590 --> 00:01:32.409
 let's say oval with a curve here like 

00:01:30.640 --> 00:01:33.880
 they are straight line they reach us not to know 

00:01:32.409 --> 00:01:36.909
 no difference between one of them 

00:01:33.880 --> 00:01:39.369
 but good is how we are going to 

00:01:36.909 --> 00:01:42.310
 be able to adapt that let's see the 

00:01:39.369 --> 00:01:44.070
 next let's eliminate this let's 

00:01:42.310 --> 00:01:46.950
 see the text 

00:01:44.070 --> 00:01:49.590
 as we see here in the text because I get 

00:01:46.950 --> 00:01:51.120
 in the center we get the word text and 

00:01:49.590 --> 00:01:53.010
 we appear does not appear 

00:01:51.120 --> 00:01:54.420
 here in the properties panel that 

00:01:53.010 --> 00:01:56.160
 well we have this field where we go 

00:01:54.420 --> 00:02:00.020
 to be able to write the text we want 

00:01:56.160 --> 00:02:00.020
 for example let's put it here cool 

00:02:00.479 --> 00:02:04.290
 this well then is going to replicate to know 

00:02:02.280 --> 00:02:06.210
 it's tabulator to accept it from this 

00:02:04.290 --> 00:02:08.250
 side let's see what the point of origin 

00:02:06.210 --> 00:02:10.500
 from normand to the right this we are going to 

00:02:08.250 --> 00:02:11.459
 can modify or adjust it first 

00:02:10.500 --> 00:02:13.740
 let's see the type of source 

00:02:11.459 --> 00:02:16.110
 obviously, we have several types 

00:02:13.740 --> 00:02:18.060
 from sources we will be able to choose 

00:02:16.110 --> 00:02:20.100
 example we have a pretty amount 

00:02:18.060 --> 00:02:22.530
 wide us to us we can 

00:02:20.100 --> 00:02:24.390
 confirm them for music word here that 

00:02:22.530 --> 00:02:25.830
 is the important thing is to go further back thing 

00:02:24.390 --> 00:02:27.150
 important if we want for example your 

00:02:25.830 --> 00:02:30.540
 I have the left alignment 

00:02:27.150 --> 00:02:32.280
 command the center the height obviously 

00:02:30.540 --> 00:02:35.790
 the width that what it does is that I 

00:02:32.280 --> 00:02:39.550
 scale the horizontal space that is to say me 

00:02:35.790 --> 00:02:42.760
 do you create me spaces between the letters 

00:02:39.550 --> 00:02:43.990
 modify it by space space 

00:02:42.760 --> 00:02:46.480
 vertical this is when for example 

00:02:43.990 --> 00:02:47.980
 we have two lines or more then here 

00:02:46.480 --> 00:02:49.990
 I would have sense at the moment I do not have more 

00:02:47.980 --> 00:02:52.030
 that a girl then does not make sense and 

00:02:49.990 --> 00:02:54.430
 then this is about separating letters that 

00:02:52.030 --> 00:02:57.340
 is what this does basically is that 

00:02:54.430 --> 00:03:00.310
 when we create or do this 

00:02:57.340 --> 00:03:02.680
 text to avoidable and we create a spline 

00:03:00.310 --> 00:03:04.330
 if we leave it deactivated if I activate it 

00:03:02.680 --> 00:03:04.750
 what he is going to do is that each of 

00:03:04.330 --> 00:03:07.540
 they 

00:03:04.750 --> 00:03:09.460
 every letter will do it when he does 

00:03:07.540 --> 00:03:12.190
 as an editable object as an object and 

00:03:09.460 --> 00:03:15.490
 indifferent wait for this independent 

00:03:12.190 --> 00:03:18.610
 let's do it let's make it editable 

00:03:15.490 --> 00:03:21.820
 as we see here we have all this that is 

00:03:18.610 --> 00:03:26.050
 an object explained if we go to the 

00:03:21.820 --> 00:03:29.110
 vertices we will make of 

00:03:26.050 --> 00:03:30.880
 control z look like this and now we're going to 

00:03:29.110 --> 00:03:33.250
 do it separate the extraction on the 

00:03:30.880 --> 00:03:36.520
 difference really let's do it 

00:03:33.250 --> 00:03:38.830
 editable 100 points and as we see here 

00:03:36.520 --> 00:03:40.690
 each of them is different you can not see 

00:03:38.830 --> 00:03:42.490
 you do not notice because it's good ok what 

00:03:40.690 --> 00:03:43.870
 happens is that I create a null object from 

00:03:42.490 --> 00:03:45.850
 living up here when I 

00:03:43.870 --> 00:03:48.160
 I display I see that each letter has 

00:03:45.850 --> 00:03:50.320
 own explained then very good this 

00:03:48.160 --> 00:03:52.810
 It can be more useful when we want 

00:03:50.320 --> 00:03:54.140
 edit the letters modify it assume it 

00:03:52.810 --> 00:03:55.819
 I do not know 

00:03:54.140 --> 00:03:59.390
 but you have to see our tool that 

00:03:55.819 --> 00:04:02.060
 is new in cinema 4d in terms of text 

00:03:59.390 --> 00:04:05.540
 which is basically show this hewitt 

00:04:02.060 --> 00:04:08.300
 train 3 of forgiveness this what this 

00:04:05.540 --> 00:04:09.709
 is a 3d that will allow us as 

00:04:08.300 --> 00:04:13.550
 we see with unfold here in this 

00:04:09.709 --> 00:04:15.620
 little button this this little triangle 

00:04:13.550 --> 00:04:17.480
 learning to emit move a letter 

00:04:15.620 --> 00:04:20.780
 with respect to another up and towards 

00:04:17.480 --> 00:04:22.250
 down distances all this is going to 

00:04:20.780 --> 00:04:24.470
 activate as soon as we have the node 

00:04:22.250 --> 00:04:26.210
 3 at the moment we do not have it so we're going to 

00:04:24.470 --> 00:04:29.030
 see us limit not just the mode 

00:04:26.210 --> 00:04:31.100
 spline but here we have a court of 

00:04:29.030 --> 00:04:33.110
 pretty important options let's say in 

00:04:31.100 --> 00:04:35.600
 as far as editing nothing but this is the 

00:04:33.110 --> 00:04:37.490
 3d mode in terms of other options we're going 

00:04:35.600 --> 00:04:39.290
 to use the rest as it puts we have the 

00:04:37.490 --> 00:04:41.960
 typical not the plane where you are going to 

00:04:39.290 --> 00:04:44.120
 apply return 

00:04:41.960 --> 00:04:46.160
 as for the address remember 

00:04:44.120 --> 00:04:48.139
 invest that give the address how you 

00:04:46.160 --> 00:04:51.820
 is creating this the intermediate points 

00:04:48.139 --> 00:04:56.050
 if we want it natural adaptive 

00:04:51.820 --> 00:04:58.990
 seen the same amount of points we go 

00:04:56.050 --> 00:05:00.820
 to eliminate it then good would be 

00:04:58.990 --> 00:05:04.890
 I invite you all to continue seeing this 

00:05:00.820 --> 00:05:04.890
 course and then until the next
