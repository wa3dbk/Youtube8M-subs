00:00:17.850 --> 00:00:22.890
 knit sliding loop 

00:00:32.810 --> 00:00:49.810
 and then inside the sliding loop 

00:00:35.860 --> 00:00:49.810
 knit 9 crochet 1 1 2 

00:01:01.800 --> 00:01:04.800

00:01:16.110 --> 00:01:22.290
 8 and 9 

00:01:22.410 --> 00:01:29.490
 then we slide a sliding loop and 

00:01:29.520 --> 00:01:40.650
 we connect the first and last loops 

00:01:33.730 --> 00:01:40.650
 close by connecting loop 

00:01:43.110 --> 00:02:01.170
 now knit 6 air loops 1 2 3 4 

00:01:57.450 --> 00:02:06.119
 5 and 6 

00:02:01.170 --> 00:02:11.650
 we crouch on a hook and skipping 3 

00:02:06.119 --> 00:02:14.640
 tabs on the fourth loop vdevaem 

00:02:11.650 --> 00:02:14.640
 hook and knit 

00:02:15.880 --> 00:02:24.040
 double crochet and knit in 

00:02:22.810 --> 00:02:35.190
 this loop 

00:02:24.040 --> 00:02:35.190
 5 more posts with one double bow 2 

00:02:40.730 --> 00:02:43.569
 3 

00:02:48.180 --> 00:02:57.540
 4 and at the same point knit 5 

00:02:52.689 --> 00:02:57.540
 single crochets now 

00:03:01.890 --> 00:03:14.769
 knit the next loop 

00:03:05.879 --> 00:03:20.319
 connecting loop and here we have the first 

00:03:14.769 --> 00:03:23.680
 the leaf is ready then a little bit 

00:03:20.319 --> 00:03:25.470
 take out the loop out of it 

00:03:23.680 --> 00:03:31.090
 hook 

00:03:25.470 --> 00:03:35.159
 move the leaf away and draw the hook into 

00:03:31.090 --> 00:03:35.159
 previous base loop 

00:03:35.549 --> 00:03:42.629
 grab our discarded loop and 

00:03:40.889 --> 00:03:50.280
 we drag 

00:03:42.629 --> 00:03:50.280
 loop through the bases 

00:03:51.090 --> 00:04:05.910
 further knit mystic in the same way 

00:03:54.040 --> 00:04:07.840
 we knit 6 air loops 1 2 3 4 5 

00:04:05.910 --> 00:04:12.599
 6 

00:04:07.840 --> 00:04:17.709
 we do nakid on a hook we pass three 

00:04:12.599 --> 00:04:18.930
 loop in the fourth loop will be 

00:04:17.709 --> 00:04:24.870
 knit 

00:04:18.930 --> 00:04:24.870
 6 single crochet posts 1 

00:04:30.060 --> 00:04:32.540

00:04:53.700 --> 00:04:56.450
 five 

00:05:00.700 --> 00:05:03.720
 and 6 

00:05:03.980 --> 00:05:18.670
 and then the next loop of the base here's 

00:05:10.520 --> 00:05:24.920
 here we knit a connecting loop and 

00:05:18.670 --> 00:05:27.850
 Here we have 2 leaves ready next 

00:05:24.920 --> 00:05:32.830
 knitting repeat exactly the same 

00:05:27.850 --> 00:05:37.250
 take out a little loop then 

00:05:32.830 --> 00:05:44.420
 bend the leaf and in the previous loop 

00:05:37.250 --> 00:05:50.110
 the bases we take a hook we seize 

00:05:44.420 --> 00:05:50.110
 our loop that we left and 

00:05:52.480 --> 00:06:00.100
 drag it through the loop of the base and 

00:06:02.800 --> 00:06:10.580
 continue to knit the next sheet 

00:06:06.290 --> 00:06:13.550
 in the same way, I tied all those 

00:06:10.580 --> 00:06:18.580
 crosses and this is my flower 

00:06:13.550 --> 00:06:23.050
 It turned out and here are a few more flowers 

00:06:18.580 --> 00:06:23.050
 made in this way
