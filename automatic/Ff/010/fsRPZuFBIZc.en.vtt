before practicing any other free

00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:25.270 
before practicing any other free
subjects<00:01:23.509> I<00:01:23.690> recommend<00:01:24.200> doing<00:01:24.350> that<00:01:24.470> because

00:01:25.270 --> 00:01:25.280

when you have learned this with your
both<00:01:27.020> feet<00:01:27.289> it's<00:01:27.590> easier<00:01:28.039> to<00:01:28.280> do<00:01:28.970> some<00:01:29.240> combos

00:01:29.830 --> 00:01:29.840 
both feet it's easier to do some combos

00:01:29.840 --> 00:01:31.750 
both feet it's easier to do some combos
and<00:01:30.170> like<00:01:30.860> that<00:01:31.039> you<00:01:31.159> know

00:01:31.750 --> 00:01:31.760 
and like that you know

00:01:31.760 --> 00:01:35.140 
and like that you know
and<00:01:32.680> now<00:01:33.680> we're<00:01:33.830> going<00:01:33.920> to<00:01:33.980> tell<00:01:34.160> you<00:01:34.340> a<00:01:34.670> few

00:01:35.140 --> 00:01:35.150 
and now we're going to tell you a few

00:01:35.150 --> 00:01:36.940 
and now we're going to tell you a few
things<00:01:35.390> that<00:01:35.840> you<00:01:35.930> should<00:01:35.960> concentrate<00:01:36.500> on

00:01:36.940 --> 00:01:36.950 
things that you should concentrate on

00:01:36.950 --> 00:01:39.010 
things that you should concentrate on
when<00:01:37.220> you're<00:01:37.340> practicing<00:01:37.520> this<00:01:38.000> really<00:01:38.330> so

00:01:39.010 --> 00:01:39.020 
when you're practicing this really so

00:01:39.020 --> 00:01:41.770 
when you're practicing this really so
first<00:01:39.320> thing<00:01:39.530> is<00:01:39.740> you<00:01:40.250> should<00:01:40.430> try<00:01:40.640> to<00:01:40.700> get<00:01:41.630> the

00:01:41.770 --> 00:01:41.780 
first thing is you should try to get the

00:01:41.780 --> 00:01:43.900 
first thing is you should try to get the
ball<00:01:41.930> with<00:01:42.320> this<00:01:42.470> part<00:01:42.530> of<00:01:42.950> your<00:01:43.010> foot<00:01:43.460> this

00:01:43.900 --> 00:01:43.910 
ball with this part of your foot this

00:01:43.910 --> 00:01:45.970 
ball with this part of your foot this
outside<00:01:44.420> part<00:01:44.660> because<00:01:45.410> going<00:01:45.620> to<00:01:45.680> do<00:01:45.740> that

00:01:45.970 --> 00:01:45.980 
outside part because going to do that

00:01:45.980 --> 00:01:48.460 
outside part because going to do that
the<00:01:46.250> ball<00:01:46.460> doesn't<00:01:46.850> go<00:01:47.150> too<00:01:47.210> high<00:01:47.690> and<00:01:48.020> if<00:01:48.320> it

00:01:48.460 --> 00:01:48.470 
the ball doesn't go too high and if it

00:01:48.470 --> 00:01:51.130 
the ball doesn't go too high and if it
goes<00:01:48.650> too<00:01:48.920> high<00:01:49.130> it's<00:01:49.790> really<00:01:50.060> hard<00:01:50.300> to<00:01:50.600> move

00:01:51.130 --> 00:01:51.140 
goes too high it's really hard to move

00:01:51.140 --> 00:01:54.790 
goes too high it's really hard to move
your<00:01:51.200> leg<00:01:51.590> around<00:01:51.950> the<00:01:52.280> ball<00:01:52.370> but<00:01:53.530> if<00:01:54.530> you<00:01:54.650> keep

00:01:54.790 --> 00:01:54.800 
your leg around the ball but if you keep

00:01:54.800 --> 00:01:57.850 
your leg around the ball but if you keep
it<00:01:54.920> low<00:01:55.100> you<00:01:55.790> can<00:01:55.970> easily<00:01:56.240> bring<00:01:56.810> it<00:01:56.960> over<00:01:57.740> it

00:01:57.850 --> 00:01:57.860 
it low you can easily bring it over it

00:01:57.860 --> 00:02:02.050 
it low you can easily bring it over it
and<00:01:59.350> another<00:02:00.350> thing<00:02:00.620> why<00:02:00.890> it's<00:02:01.070> good<00:02:01.760> to<00:02:01.880> hit

00:02:02.050 --> 00:02:02.060 
and another thing why it's good to hit

00:02:02.060 --> 00:02:04.420 
and another thing why it's good to hit
with<00:02:02.330> this<00:02:02.510> part<00:02:02.810> of<00:02:02.930> the<00:02:03.050> truth<00:02:03.260> is<00:02:03.470> that<00:02:03.500> we

00:02:04.420 --> 00:02:04.430 
with this part of the truth is that we

00:02:04.430 --> 00:02:07.450 
with this part of the truth is that we
do<00:02:04.640> that<00:02:04.880> ball<00:02:05.330> starts<00:02:05.780> spin<00:02:06.140> a<00:02:06.320> little<00:02:06.530> bit<00:02:06.830> so

00:02:07.450 --> 00:02:07.460 
do that ball starts spin a little bit so

00:02:07.460 --> 00:02:10.180 
do that ball starts spin a little bit so
you<00:02:07.880> can<00:02:07.910> with<00:02:08.180> the<00:02:08.300> same<00:02:08.510> movement<00:02:09.290> you<00:02:10.040> hit

00:02:10.180 --> 00:02:10.190 
you can with the same movement you hit

00:02:10.190 --> 00:02:12.070 
you can with the same movement you hit
the<00:02:10.340> ball<00:02:10.490> and<00:02:10.790> you<00:02:10.940> can<00:02:11.090> straightaway<00:02:11.480> start

00:02:12.070 --> 00:02:12.080 
the ball and you can straightaway start

00:02:12.080 --> 00:02:14.530 
the ball and you can straightaway start
moving<00:02:12.620> your<00:02:12.740> leg<00:02:12.980> around<00:02:13.490> the<00:02:13.610> ball<00:02:13.670> so

00:02:14.530 --> 00:02:14.540 
moving your leg around the ball so

00:02:14.540 --> 00:02:16.960 
moving your leg around the ball so
that's<00:02:14.840> one<00:02:14.990> of<00:02:15.080> things<00:02:15.380> I<00:02:15.590> find<00:02:16.220> helpful<00:02:16.640> when

00:02:16.960 --> 00:02:16.970 
that's one of things I find helpful when

00:02:16.970 --> 00:02:18.340 
that's one of things I find helpful when
you're<00:02:17.060> practicing<00:02:17.270> is<00:02:17.660> when<00:02:18.260> you're

00:02:18.340 --> 00:02:18.350 
you're practicing is when you're

00:02:18.350 --> 00:02:20.080 
you're practicing is when you're
practicing<00:02:18.590> this<00:02:19.070> trick<00:02:19.220> don't<00:02:19.580> think<00:02:19.880> that

00:02:20.080 --> 00:02:20.090 
practicing this trick don't think that

00:02:20.090 --> 00:02:21.910 
practicing this trick don't think that
the<00:02:20.240> most<00:02:20.420> important<00:02:21.050> thing<00:02:21.290> is<00:02:21.500> to<00:02:21.710> move<00:02:21.860> your

00:02:21.910 --> 00:02:21.920 
the most important thing is to move your

00:02:21.920 --> 00:02:23.710 
the most important thing is to move your
leg<00:02:22.250> around<00:02:22.460> the<00:02:22.700> ball<00:02:22.790> as<00:02:23.150> quickly<00:02:23.480> as

00:02:23.710 --> 00:02:23.720 
leg around the ball as quickly as

00:02:23.720 --> 00:02:25.840 
leg around the ball as quickly as
possible<00:02:23.830> if<00:02:24.830> you<00:02:24.950> do<00:02:25.040> that<00:02:25.250> you<00:02:25.550> will<00:02:25.700> just

00:02:25.840 --> 00:02:25.850 
possible if you do that you will just

00:02:25.850 --> 00:02:28.330 
possible if you do that you will just
make<00:02:26.570> it<00:02:26.600> look<00:02:26.810> stupid<00:02:27.320> and<00:02:27.620> you<00:02:27.890> make<00:02:28.100> it<00:02:28.220> a

00:02:28.330 --> 00:02:28.340 
make it look stupid and you make it a

00:02:28.340 --> 00:02:31.690 
make it look stupid and you make it a
lot<00:02:28.520> harder<00:02:28.760> to<00:02:29.060> learn<00:02:29.210> so<00:02:30.080> I<00:02:30.410> would<00:02:31.400> say<00:02:31.550> the

00:02:31.690 --> 00:02:31.700 
lot harder to learn so I would say the

00:02:31.700 --> 00:02:35.200 
lot harder to learn so I would say the
most<00:02:31.880> important<00:02:32.510> thing<00:02:32.540> is<00:02:33.170> to<00:02:33.790> do<00:02:34.790> the<00:02:34.970> trick

00:02:35.200 --> 00:02:35.210 
most important thing is to do the trick

00:02:35.210 --> 00:02:37.690 
most important thing is to do the trick
with<00:02:35.420> not<00:02:35.780> one<00:02:36.110> movement<00:02:36.590> and<00:02:37.160> I<00:02:37.280> mean<00:02:37.490> that

00:02:37.690 --> 00:02:37.700 
with not one movement and I mean that

00:02:37.700 --> 00:02:40.090 
with not one movement and I mean that
you<00:02:38.480> don't<00:02:38.720> first<00:02:39.020> hit<00:02:39.350> the<00:02:39.380> ball<00:02:39.650> and<00:02:39.890> then

00:02:40.090 --> 00:02:40.100 
you don't first hit the ball and then

00:02:40.100 --> 00:02:42.730 
you don't first hit the ball and then
start<00:02:40.580> moving<00:02:40.970> the<00:02:41.060> leg<00:02:41.240> around<00:02:41.600> it<00:02:41.780> you<00:02:42.500> just

00:02:42.730 --> 00:02:42.740 
start moving the leg around it you just

00:02:42.740 --> 00:02:44.290 
start moving the leg around it you just
do<00:02:42.920> it<00:02:43.040> with<00:02:43.130> the<00:02:43.190> same<00:02:43.400> motion<00:02:43.700> hit<00:02:44.030> the<00:02:44.150> ball

00:02:44.290 --> 00:02:44.300 
do it with the same motion hit the ball

00:02:44.300 --> 00:02:46.449 
do it with the same motion hit the ball
and<00:02:44.480> right<00:02:44.690> right<00:02:45.170> after<00:02:45.530> it<00:02:45.650> start<00:02:46.040> moving

00:02:46.449 --> 00:02:46.459 
and right right after it start moving

00:02:46.459 --> 00:02:50.380 
and right right after it start moving
the<00:02:46.520> leg<00:02:46.730> around<00:02:46.940> it<00:02:47.270> so<00:02:48.170> I<00:02:48.970> don't<00:02:49.970> know<00:02:50.150> what

00:02:50.380 --> 00:02:50.390 
the leg around it so I don't know what

00:02:50.390 --> 00:02:52.000 
the leg around it so I don't know what
else<00:02:50.570> to<00:02:50.630> say<00:02:50.810> about<00:02:50.930> this<00:02:51.200> trick<00:02:51.470> it's<00:02:51.680> really

00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:52.010 
else to say about this trick it's really

00:02:52.010 --> 00:02:54.820
