00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.470
 hi everyone this is jordan on 

00:00:02.520 --> 00:00:06.540
 tutoring so welcome for a small 

00:00:04.470 --> 00:00:08.610
 fishy video since I'm going 

00:00:06.540 --> 00:00:13.500
 to draw a little fish rather do 

00:00:08.610 --> 00:00:16.320
 a sketch out of a fish going in 

00:00:13.500 --> 00:00:17.910
 observing that it is not very complicated 

00:00:16.320 --> 00:00:19.320
 to do by passing on it is going to be 

00:00:17.910 --> 00:00:21.240
 quite complex at the level of the swimmers 

00:00:19.320 --> 00:00:23.760
 as we might think sometimes 

00:00:21.240 --> 00:00:25.890
 there are then upper dorsal columns the 

00:00:23.760 --> 00:00:28.019
 tail and on the side only two 

00:00:25.890 --> 00:00:30.480
 fins one to the left and the right 

00:00:28.019 --> 00:00:32.850
 good there I know profile we will see 

00:00:30.480 --> 00:00:35.670
 that one but there is not only that there 

00:00:32.850 --> 00:00:41.010
 has one under the belly of the rpt of 

00:00:35.670 --> 00:00:42.960
 fish that has that is big enough and 

00:00:41.010 --> 00:00:45.180
 another towards the reception which is at 

00:00:42.960 --> 00:00:47.550
 the back which is a little smaller 

00:00:45.180 --> 00:00:49.230
 she is 

00:00:47.550 --> 00:00:53.610
 in general it is also of two 

00:00:49.230 --> 00:00:55.140
 sides a bit like the fin before these 

00:00:53.610 --> 00:01:00.059
 two there is found gerald of both 

00:00:55.140 --> 00:01:03.600
 sides and I wanted to tell you 

00:01:00.059 --> 00:01:05.040
 all thanks a lot because we're in 

00:01:03.600 --> 00:01:06.990
 course on a digit so we make 10 

00:01:05.040 --> 00:01:09.900
 but the subscriber for for the string what 

00:01:06.990 --> 00:01:11.520
 is a bit of an event anyway 

00:01:09.900 --> 00:01:14.940
 I have not finished special what I did 

00:01:11.520 --> 00:01:16.909
 fine last week on my channel 

00:01:14.940 --> 00:01:19.860
 that they come from 

00:01:16.909 --> 00:01:23.340
 to make a hundred thousand people who me 

00:01:19.860 --> 00:01:25.080
 follow what is very very big and 

00:01:23.340 --> 00:01:26.399
 for that I made a little video where 

00:01:25.080 --> 00:01:31.470
 I gathered about a hundred 

00:01:26.399 --> 00:01:34.350
 of drawings since 2009 we wanted the 

00:01:31.470 --> 00:01:40.080
 see if you have not seen it anyway 

00:01:34.350 --> 00:01:42.000
 thank you so much thanks a thousand times and I 

00:01:40.080 --> 00:01:44.820
 think that in about two weeks or so 

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:45.840
 I will do a little contest to the little 

00:01:44.820 --> 00:01:48.420
 contest it's been a while since I 

00:01:45.840 --> 00:01:49.080
 speak and this time it's the good one 

00:01:48.420 --> 00:01:52.920
 time to do it 

00:01:49.080 --> 00:01:56.670
 so within two to three weeks the month 

00:01:52.920 --> 00:01:58.140
 next there will be so announce it with 

00:01:56.670 --> 00:02:01.800
 the rules I will put rules everywhere 

00:01:58.140 --> 00:02:02.960
 on the site on social networks not 

00:02:01.800 --> 00:02:04.970
 on my channel 

00:02:02.960 --> 00:02:07.940
 tuto drao since a lot 

00:02:04.970 --> 00:02:09.979
 English speakers and not to participate 

00:02:07.940 --> 00:02:11.510
 unfortunately so it will only be 

00:02:09.979 --> 00:02:13.700
 on the tutorial channel so no 

00:02:11.510 --> 00:02:15.530
 of worry will be a video ad I 

00:02:13.700 --> 00:02:17.510
 will announce it in the big title contest of 

00:02:15.530 --> 00:02:20.510
 drawing number one 

00:02:17.510 --> 00:02:23.630
 something like that and I will announce 

00:02:20.510 --> 00:02:24.760
 also the rules and what has to key 

00:02:23.630 --> 00:02:27.590
 the hdi 

00:02:24.760 --> 00:02:30.230
 so to go back to drawing so our 

00:02:27.590 --> 00:02:34.330
 drink read I did not say but he is 

00:02:30.230 --> 00:02:38.000
 done with the b2b pen 

00:02:34.330 --> 00:02:41.510
 why because a little leaning on it 

00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:43.250
 without damaging the paper and that we 

00:02:41.510 --> 00:02:45.410
 still gives little hue to these 

00:02:43.250 --> 00:02:47.420
 wrong is who can agree 

00:02:45.410 --> 00:02:51.500
 especially for the video to come out 

00:02:47.420 --> 00:02:56.209
 better but otherwise I think it's 

00:02:51.500 --> 00:03:00.130
 better to use a rather h2h pencil at 

00:02:56.209 --> 00:03:02.360
 pencil hb have not too much damage the sheet 

00:03:00.130 --> 00:03:04.880
 because it's still a sketch so a 

00:03:02.360 --> 00:03:06.319
 sketch finally it's not the purpose 

00:03:04.880 --> 00:03:07.820
 spat, so we'll go back over 

00:03:06.319 --> 00:03:12.260
 so the best thing is to do with a 

00:03:07.820 --> 00:03:13.880
 pencil not very powerful here otherwise we 

00:03:12.260 --> 00:03:15.200
 gets to the end of the video so that's 

00:03:13.880 --> 00:03:18.860
 all I want to talk about I'm going 

00:03:15.200 --> 00:03:21.680
 send more videos as you go 

00:03:18.860 --> 00:03:23.750
 measure so do not hesitate to give your 

00:03:21.680 --> 00:03:24.890
 notice I read your comments even though 

00:03:23.750 --> 00:03:26.660
 but I can not unfortunately 

00:03:24.890 --> 00:03:28.140
 to answer everyone that would take me 

00:03:26.660 --> 00:03:30.960
 the weather 

00:03:28.140 --> 00:03:32.220
 that I need for to draw in 

00:03:30.960 --> 00:03:34.380
 Anyway I hope this little drawing 

00:03:32.220 --> 00:03:35.910
 you will have enjoyed do not forget to put a 

00:03:34.380 --> 00:03:38.420
 I like it if you liked the video 

00:03:35.910 --> 00:03:41.459
 or I do not like it if you did not like it 

00:03:38.420 --> 00:03:43.350
 I do not know if you know but I 

00:03:41.459 --> 00:03:44.640
 games there are a lot of time but in 

00:03:43.350 --> 00:03:46.800
 a time I remember it I have the site 

00:03:44.640 --> 00:03:48.209
 internet for those who are looking for 

00:03:46.800 --> 00:03:51.450
 only the tutorials so that's 

00:03:48.209 --> 00:03:53.190
 tutoring points as in the category 

00:03:51.450 --> 00:03:57.840
 you should have all the tutorials 

00:03:53.190 --> 00:03:59.310
 that I realized in one will say 95% of 

00:03:57.840 --> 00:04:01.620
 tutorials for some I have not 

00:03:59.310 --> 00:04:03.660
 apart from lack of quality I found 

00:04:01.620 --> 00:04:05.040
 I answer a small question that 

00:04:03.660 --> 00:04:06.810
 I often ask myself so this is the 

00:04:05.040 --> 00:04:09.630
 beginners material often you me 

00:04:06.810 --> 00:04:11.910
 ask which material to choose for 

00:04:09.630 --> 00:04:15.140
 start and I answer you general 

00:04:11.910 --> 00:04:19.430
 it takes too much pencil so at hb 

00:04:15.140 --> 00:04:22.039
 1-1 stretch and a hard so hear c 

00:04:19.430 --> 00:04:27.289
 the funds is good French so 

00:04:22.039 --> 00:04:34.100
 b by that I advise 4 b2b and a 

00:04:27.289 --> 00:04:36.919
 hard pencil so 2h speaks at 4am and a 

00:04:34.100 --> 00:04:40.250
 pencil hb with no name can do all 

00:04:36.919 --> 00:04:42.500
 our sketches an eraser of course a 

00:04:40.250 --> 00:04:45.320
 blurs a stump hours yes a paper 

00:04:42.500 --> 00:04:46.910
 a smallness falls a paper that one 

00:04:45.320 --> 00:04:49.340
 can use our finger if you do not 

00:04:46.910 --> 00:04:50.660
 not but befitting these little rolls of 

00:04:49.340 --> 00:04:53.720
 compressed paper that you find in 

00:04:50.660 --> 00:04:55.280
 the cultural plans so I quote my 

00:04:53.720 --> 00:04:58.550
 store that I use me I said you 

00:04:55.280 --> 00:04:59.690
 know I bought my mattel at cultura I 

00:04:58.550 --> 00:05:00.949
 do not know if you have a near home 

00:04:59.690 --> 00:05:02.150
 you but that's the bar so I'm going 

00:05:00.949 --> 00:05:04.280
 you can also provide on 

00:05:02.150 --> 00:05:05.960
 internet and for the past to him since 

00:05:04.280 --> 00:05:07.820
 I use a black material that is 

00:05:05.960 --> 00:05:11.539
 granular little like the cricket but 

00:05:07.820 --> 00:05:13.970
 much more granular is the pastel 

00:05:11.539 --> 00:05:16.070
 black it looks very close to the 

00:05:13.970 --> 00:05:18.229
 coal is after all for the 

00:05:16.070 --> 00:05:18.830
 mark visit story in paris this is the 

00:05:18.229 --> 00:05:21.620
 brand name 

00:05:18.830 --> 00:05:24.199
 here I talked about stamping a pen 

00:05:21.620 --> 00:05:26.180
 black must take if the black peak is 

00:05:24.199 --> 00:05:29.750
 perfect for outlines to anchor 

00:05:26.180 --> 00:05:30.830
 your manga characters or whatever 

00:05:29.750 --> 00:05:33.680
 it can be pretty bad 

00:05:30.830 --> 00:05:35.210
 and here are the sheets a3 for big 

00:05:33.680 --> 00:05:37.039
 designs the A4 leaves for the little ones 

00:05:35.210 --> 00:05:38.389
 desserts I think to start it's 

00:05:37.039 --> 00:05:39.409
 really the top 

00:05:38.389 --> 00:05:42.139
 afterwards if we want to do drawing in 

00:05:39.409 --> 00:05:45.770
 colors for me the best is the 

00:05:42.139 --> 00:05:46.840
 pastel the cool pastel so we come to 

00:05:45.770 --> 00:05:48.740
 the end of the video 

00:05:46.840 --> 00:05:50.950
 the background image for those who are there 

00:05:48.740 --> 00:05:52.870
 pile digital paint c 

00:05:50.950 --> 00:05:56.550
 on tablet so I'm done 

00:05:52.870 --> 00:05:58.900
 it's about two years ago and that's it 

00:05:56.550 --> 00:06:00.460
 do not hesitate to watch the video 

00:05:58.900 --> 00:06:02.680
 Special 5000 subscribers chain 

00:06:00.460 --> 00:06:08.010
 main it will summarize to you what 

00:06:02.680 --> 00:06:11.140
