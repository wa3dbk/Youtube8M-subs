00:01:36.900 --> 00:01:38.899 
year and then I'll come back down and
then<00:01:37.049> recover<00:01:37.530> everything<00:01:38.040> over<00:01:38.400> you<00:01:38.579> can<00:01:38.729> see

00:01:38.899 --> 00:01:38.909 
then recover everything over you can see

00:01:38.909 --> 00:01:41.480 
then recover everything over you can see
where<00:01:39.150> everything's<00:01:39.479> died<00:01:39.720> off<00:01:40.490> that's

00:01:41.480 --> 00:01:41.490 
where everything's died off that's

00:01:41.490 --> 00:01:45.820 
where everything's died off that's
frozen<00:01:41.850> solid<00:01:42.270> that<00:01:42.540> ground

00:01:45.820 --> 00:01:45.830 

00:01:45.830 --> 00:01:48.910 

yep<00:01:46.700> that's<00:01:46.910> exactly<00:01:47.120> as<00:01:47.810> I<00:01:47.870> left<00:01:48.110> it<00:01:48.530> before

00:01:48.910 --> 00:01:48.920 
yep that's exactly as I left it before

00:01:48.920 --> 00:01:52.300 
yep that's exactly as I left it before
all<00:01:49.220> the<00:01:49.400> leaves<00:01:49.610> have<00:01:49.940> come<00:01:50.120> off<00:01:50.270> the<00:01:50.920> vines<00:01:51.920> I

00:01:52.300 --> 00:01:52.310 
all the leaves have come off the vines I

00:01:52.310 --> 00:01:55.150 
all the leaves have come off the vines I
will<00:01:52.910> probably<00:01:53.180> end<00:01:53.570> up<00:01:53.840> just<00:01:54.530> maybe<00:01:54.710> trimming

00:01:55.150 --> 00:01:55.160 
will probably end up just maybe trimming

00:01:55.160 --> 00:02:00.250 
will probably end up just maybe trimming
these<00:01:55.250> off<00:01:55.460> I<00:01:56.530> don't<00:01:57.530> know<00:01:57.710> I<00:01:58.040> think<00:01:58.790> I<00:01:59.330> got<00:01:59.870> I

00:02:00.250 --> 00:02:00.260 
these off I don't know I think I got I

00:02:00.260 --> 00:02:01.960 
these off I don't know I think I got I
don't<00:02:00.410> do<00:02:00.680> some<00:02:00.860> research<00:02:01.250> on<00:02:01.490> the<00:02:01.580> trimming

00:02:01.960 --> 00:02:01.970 
don't do some research on the trimming

00:02:01.970 --> 00:02:04.420 
don't do some research on the trimming
vines<00:02:02.270> because<00:02:03.260> I'm<00:02:03.380> hoping<00:02:03.770> I<00:02:03.920> actually<00:02:04.070> get

00:02:04.420 --> 00:02:04.430 
vines because I'm hoping I actually get

00:02:04.430 --> 00:02:07.420 
vines because I'm hoping I actually get
some<00:02:04.610> grapes<00:02:04.850> this<00:02:05.210> year<00:02:05.450> I<00:02:06.160> just<00:02:07.160> have<00:02:07.310> to

00:02:07.420 --> 00:02:07.430 
some grapes this year I just have to

00:02:07.430 --> 00:02:10.870 
some grapes this year I just have to
wait<00:02:07.640> for<00:02:07.910> more<00:02:08.060> wood<00:02:08.780> growth<00:02:09.369> all<00:02:10.369> of<00:02:10.550> this<00:02:10.670> is

00:02:10.870 --> 00:02:10.880 
wait for more wood growth all of this is

00:02:17.890 --> 00:02:17.900 
these weeds in the corner that they

00:02:17.900 --> 00:02:20.320 
these weeds in the corner that they

00:02:24.160 --> 00:02:24.170 
those I will be getting some more wood

00:02:24.170 --> 00:02:27.970 
those I will be getting some more wood
and<00:02:24.470> building<00:02:25.300> raised<00:02:26.300> beds<00:02:26.620> early<00:02:27.620> in<00:02:27.830> the

00:02:27.970 --> 00:02:27.980 
and building raised beds early in the

00:02:27.980 --> 00:02:30.820 
and building raised beds early in the
spring<00:02:28.810> unless<00:02:29.810> we<00:02:29.990> get<00:02:30.080> some<00:02:30.140> exceptionally

00:02:30.820 --> 00:02:30.830 
spring unless we get some exceptionally

00:02:30.830 --> 00:02:34.660 
spring unless we get some exceptionally
good<00:02:30.980> weather<00:02:31.190> before<00:02:32.150> that<00:02:33.250> but<00:02:34.250> yeah<00:02:34.400> raised

00:02:34.660 --> 00:02:34.670 
good weather before that but yeah raised

00:02:34.670 --> 00:02:36.340 
good weather before that but yeah raised
beds<00:02:34.910> will<00:02:35.450> be<00:02:35.600> the<00:02:35.690> order<00:02:35.810> of<00:02:35.930> the<00:02:36.020> day<00:02:36.170> in

00:02:36.340 --> 00:02:36.350 
beds will be the order of the day in

00:02:36.350 --> 00:02:37.870 
beds will be the order of the day in
here<00:02:36.710> now<00:02:36.950> I'm<00:02:37.100> thinking<00:02:37.430> the<00:02:37.460> best<00:02:37.700> thing<00:02:37.850> to

00:02:37.870 --> 00:02:37.880 
here now I'm thinking the best thing to

00:02:37.880 --> 00:02:39.820 
here now I'm thinking the best thing to
do<00:02:38.060> is<00:02:38.270> just<00:02:38.510> do<00:02:38.660> a<00:02:38.690> few<00:02:39.020> raised<00:02:39.290> beds<00:02:39.590> each

00:02:39.820 --> 00:02:39.830 
do is just do a few raised beds each

00:02:39.830 --> 00:02:41.880 
do is just do a few raised beds each
year<00:02:40.160> that<00:02:40.340> way<00:02:40.670> it<00:02:40.790> won't<00:02:40.910> be<00:02:41.030> too<00:02:41.270> expensive

00:02:41.880 --> 00:02:41.890 
year that way it won't be too expensive

00:02:41.890 --> 00:02:44.710 
year that way it won't be too expensive
and<00:02:42.890> I<00:02:42.980> just<00:02:43.190> kind<00:02:43.370> of<00:02:43.400> build<00:02:43.640> up<00:02:43.850> and<00:02:44.450> the<00:02:44.510> same

00:02:44.710 --> 00:02:44.720 
and I just kind of build up and the same

00:02:44.720 --> 00:02:46.330 
and I just kind of build up and the same
out<00:02:44.900> here<00:02:44.930> I'll<00:02:45.320> just<00:02:45.350> kind<00:02:45.680> of<00:02:45.740> build<00:02:45.980> up<00:02:46.100> a

00:02:46.330 --> 00:02:46.340 
out here I'll just kind of build up a

00:02:46.340 --> 00:02:49.390 
out here I'll just kind of build up a
number<00:02:46.760> of<00:02:46.850> raised<00:02:47.060> beds<00:02:47.330> slowly<00:02:48.260> over<00:02:48.770> over

00:02:49.390 --> 00:02:49.400 
number of raised beds slowly over over

00:02:49.400 --> 00:02:51.070 
number of raised beds slowly over over
the<00:02:49.490> years<00:02:49.520> and<00:02:50.000> that<00:02:50.390> will<00:02:50.480> keep<00:02:50.630> the<00:02:50.750> costs

00:02:51.070 --> 00:02:51.080 
the years and that will keep the costs

00:02:51.080 --> 00:02:54.010 
the years and that will keep the costs
down<00:02:51.610> but<00:02:52.610> any<00:02:52.760> where<00:02:52.970> there<00:02:53.209> are<00:02:53.450> not<00:02:53.780> raised

00:02:54.010 --> 00:02:54.020 
down but any where there are not raised

00:02:54.020 --> 00:02:56.140 
down but any where there are not raised
beds<00:02:54.320> then<00:02:54.620> I'll<00:02:54.770> be<00:02:55.070> using<00:02:55.459> just<00:02:55.880> kind<00:02:56.120> of

00:02:56.140 --> 00:02:56.150 
beds then I'll be using just kind of

00:02:56.150 --> 00:02:58.960 
beds then I'll be using just kind of
grow<00:02:56.390> bags<00:02:56.690> and<00:02:57.110> things<00:02:57.350> like<00:02:57.500> that<00:02:57.560> so<00:02:58.070> and

containers and stuff whatever I can find

00:03:00.800 --> 00:03:05.979 
containers and stuff whatever I can find
