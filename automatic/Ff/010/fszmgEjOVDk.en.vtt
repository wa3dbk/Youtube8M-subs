sinners<00:00:19.350> Williams<00:00:19.830> I<00:00:19.949> get<00:00:20.100> a<00:00:20.130> pretty<00:00:20.369> decent

00:00:20.480 --> 00:00:20.490 
sinners Williams I get a pretty decent

00:00:20.490 --> 00:00:22.970 
sinners Williams I get a pretty decent
start<00:00:21.060> and<00:00:21.300> this<00:00:22.080> is<00:00:22.199> probably<00:00:22.410> why<00:00:22.560> I<00:00:22.590> think

00:00:22.970 --> 00:00:22.980 
start and this is probably why I think

00:00:22.980 --> 00:00:24.740 
start and this is probably why I think

with<00:00:28.680> me<00:00:28.890> whilst<00:00:29.519> I<00:00:29.670> learned<00:00:29.880> this<00:00:30.029> game<00:00:30.269> a

00:00:30.290 --> 00:00:30.300 
with me whilst I learned this game a

00:00:30.300 --> 00:00:31.429 
with me whilst I learned this game a
little<00:00:30.510> bit<00:00:30.660> because<00:00:30.869> it's<00:00:31.109> still<00:00:31.260> a<00:00:31.289> little

00:00:31.429 --> 00:00:31.439 
little bit because it's still a little

00:00:31.439 --> 00:00:33.380 
little bit because it's still a little
bit<00:00:31.619> new<00:00:31.769> to<00:00:31.800> me<00:00:32.040> and<00:00:32.189> a<00:00:32.219> bit<00:00:32.369> confusing<00:00:32.820> about

00:00:33.380 --> 00:00:33.390 
bit new to me and a bit confusing about

00:00:33.390 --> 00:00:35.420 
bit new to me and a bit confusing about
what<00:00:33.750> certain<00:00:34.110> stuff<00:00:34.350> it<00:00:34.590> does<00:00:34.829> but<00:00:35.250> I'm

00:00:35.420 --> 00:00:35.430 
what certain stuff it does but I'm

00:00:35.430 --> 00:00:37.850 
what certain stuff it does but I'm
enjoying<00:00:35.640> the<00:00:35.910> game<00:00:36.059> it's<00:00:36.630> very<00:00:36.809> decent<00:00:37.530> demo

00:00:37.850 --> 00:00:37.860 
enjoying the game it's very decent demo

00:00:37.860 --> 00:00:39.889 
enjoying the game it's very decent demo
it's<00:00:38.100> a<00:00:38.160> bit<00:00:38.370> short<00:00:38.640> of<00:00:38.790> my<00:00:39.030> liking<00:00:39.450> but<00:00:39.480> you

00:00:39.889 --> 00:00:39.899 
it's a bit short of my liking but you

00:00:39.899 --> 00:00:41.389 
it's a bit short of my liking but you
know<00:00:39.989> it's<00:00:40.200> only<00:00:40.290> a<00:00:40.410> demo<00:00:40.590> obviously<00:00:41.040> so<00:00:41.250> we

00:00:41.389 --> 00:00:41.399 
know it's only a demo obviously so we

00:00:41.399 --> 00:00:44.270 
know it's only a demo obviously so we
won't<00:00:41.579> expect<00:00:41.910> too<00:00:42.300> much<00:00:42.450> and<00:00:43.100> first<00:00:44.100> thing<00:00:44.250> I

00:00:44.270 --> 00:00:44.280 
won't expect too much and first thing I

00:00:44.280 --> 00:00:45.799 
won't expect too much and first thing I
want<00:00:44.340> to<00:00:44.430> talk<00:00:44.610> about<00:00:44.670> in<00:00:45.030> this<00:00:45.210> review<00:00:45.450> or

00:00:45.799 --> 00:00:45.809 
want to talk about in this review or

00:00:45.809 --> 00:00:48.170 
want to talk about in this review or
first<00:00:46.050> impressions<00:00:46.410> is<00:00:46.860> that<00:00:47.430> the<00:00:47.610> sort<00:00:48.090> of

00:00:48.170 --> 00:00:48.180 
first impressions is that the sort of

00:00:48.180 --> 00:00:49.819 
first impressions is that the sort of
handling<00:00:48.690> for<00:00:48.930> the<00:00:48.989> game<00:00:49.170> because<00:00:49.500> we'll<00:00:49.680> see

00:00:49.819 --> 00:00:49.829 
handling for the game because we'll see

00:00:49.829 --> 00:00:51.740 
handling for the game because we'll see
example<00:00:50.370> right<00:00:50.550> here<00:00:50.579> when<00:00:51.300> I<00:00:51.329> try<00:00:51.539> and<00:00:51.600> get

00:00:51.740 --> 00:00:51.750 
example right here when I try and get

00:00:51.750 --> 00:00:53.990 
example right here when I try and get
ramped<00:00:51.899> Perez<00:00:52.199> I<00:00:52.640> meant<00:00:53.640> to<00:00:53.730> steer<00:00:53.910> a<00:00:53.940> little

00:00:53.990 --> 00:00:54.000 
ramped Perez I meant to steer a little

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:55.939 
ramped Perez I meant to steer a little
bit<00:00:54.390> so<00:00:54.870> I<00:00:54.899> didn't<00:00:55.170> go<00:00:55.289> into<00:00:55.590> the<00:00:55.770> graph

00:00:55.939 --> 00:00:55.949 
bit so I didn't go into the graph

00:00:55.949 --> 00:00:57.799 
bit so I didn't go into the graph
obviously<00:00:56.489> but<00:00:56.969> I<00:00:57.030> wanted<00:00:57.239> to<00:00:57.360> steer<00:00:57.570> enough

00:00:57.799 --> 00:00:57.809 
obviously but I wanted to steer enough

00:00:57.809 --> 00:00:59.720 
obviously but I wanted to steer enough
that<00:00:58.020> I<00:00:58.079> was<00:00:58.230> like<00:00:58.410> still<00:00:58.739> on<00:00:58.859> the<00:00:59.039> pavement

00:00:59.720 --> 00:00:59.730 
that I was like still on the pavement

00:00:59.730 --> 00:01:03.709 
that I was like still on the pavement
and<00:00:59.850> didn't<00:01:00.120> hit<00:01:00.270> Perez<00:01:00.600> and<00:01:02.030> so<00:01:03.030> I<00:01:03.180> still<00:01:03.359> feel

00:01:03.709 --> 00:01:03.719 
and didn't hit Perez and so I still feel

00:01:03.719 --> 00:01:05.539 
and didn't hit Perez and so I still feel
it<00:01:03.899> sort<00:01:04.110> of<00:01:04.140> a<00:01:04.320> bit<00:01:04.559> too<00:01:04.769> sensitive<00:01:05.250> and<00:01:05.489> it

00:01:05.539 --> 00:01:05.549 
it sort of a bit too sensitive and it

00:01:05.549 --> 00:01:06.770 
it sort of a bit too sensitive and it
means<00:01:05.700> that<00:01:05.909> I<00:01:05.939> can't<00:01:06.330> really<00:01:06.510> do<00:01:06.630> the

00:01:06.770 --> 00:01:06.780 
means that I can't really do the

00:01:06.780 --> 00:01:08.359 
means that I can't really do the
overtakes<00:01:07.140> I<00:01:07.260> want<00:01:07.470> to<00:01:07.619> and<00:01:07.830> it<00:01:07.920> also<00:01:08.040> means

00:01:08.359 --> 00:01:08.369 
overtakes I want to and it also means

00:01:08.369 --> 00:01:09.620 
overtakes I want to and it also means
I'm<00:01:08.490> sort<00:01:08.729> of<00:01:08.760> missing<00:01:08.820> the<00:01:09.060> apex<00:01:09.420> with<00:01:09.540> the

00:01:09.620 --> 00:01:09.630 
I'm sort of missing the apex with the

00:01:09.630 --> 00:01:11.330 
I'm sort of missing the apex with the
corners<00:01:09.930> and<00:01:10.080> cutting<00:01:10.590> corners<00:01:10.799> which

00:01:11.330 --> 00:01:11.340 
corners and cutting corners which

00:01:11.340 --> 00:01:13.340 
corners and cutting corners which
obviously<00:01:11.610> is<00:01:11.909> a<00:01:11.939> bad<00:01:12.210> thing<00:01:12.240> I<00:01:12.720> don't<00:01:12.990> want<00:01:13.229> to

00:01:13.340 --> 00:01:13.350 
obviously is a bad thing I don't want to

00:01:13.350 --> 00:01:15.679 
obviously is a bad thing I don't want to
do<00:01:13.500> that<00:01:13.530> and<00:01:14.100> you<00:01:14.189> can<00:01:14.340> see<00:01:14.490> here<00:01:14.700> steer<00:01:15.509> too

00:01:15.679 --> 00:01:15.689 
do that and you can see here steer too

00:01:15.689 --> 00:01:17.240 
do that and you can see here steer too
much<00:01:15.840> again<00:01:16.080> and<00:01:16.290> nearly<00:01:16.590> hit<00:01:16.740> the<00:01:17.040> barrier

00:01:17.240 --> 00:01:17.250 
much again and nearly hit the barrier

00:01:17.250 --> 00:01:19.130 
much again and nearly hit the barrier
very<00:01:17.939> nearly<00:01:18.210> hit<00:01:18.420> the<00:01:18.450> barrier<00:01:18.720> was<00:01:18.930> trying

00:01:19.130 --> 00:01:19.140 
very nearly hit the barrier was trying

00:01:19.140 --> 00:01:21.200 
very nearly hit the barrier was trying
to<00:01:19.200> overtake<00:01:19.530> Paris<00:01:20.159> and<00:01:20.400> my<00:01:20.880> teammate

00:01:21.200 --> 00:01:21.210 
to overtake Paris and my teammate

00:01:21.210 --> 00:01:25.609 
to overtake Paris and my teammate
Maldonado<00:01:21.689> and<00:01:22.490> I<00:01:23.869> still<00:01:24.869> think<00:01:25.110> that<00:01:25.170> if<00:01:25.560> we

00:01:25.609 --> 00:01:25.619 
Maldonado and I still think that if we

00:01:25.619 --> 00:01:27.410 
Maldonado and I still think that if we
can<00:01:25.979> change<00:01:26.159> that<00:01:26.460> that'd<00:01:26.640> be<00:01:26.790> cool<00:01:26.970> I<00:01:27.270> don't

00:01:27.410 --> 00:01:27.420 
can change that that'd be cool I don't

00:01:27.420 --> 00:01:28.789 
can change that that'd be cool I don't
know<00:01:27.509> whether<00:01:27.600> you<00:01:27.750> can<00:01:27.780> either<00:01:28.320> look<00:01:28.619> too

00:01:28.789 --> 00:01:28.799 
know whether you can either look too

00:01:28.799 --> 00:01:30.950 
know whether you can either look too
much<00:01:28.920> into<00:01:28.979> it<00:01:29.759> I<00:01:30.060> didn't<00:01:30.540> think<00:01:30.630> you<00:01:30.810> could

00:01:30.950 --> 00:01:30.960 
much into it I didn't think you could

00:01:30.960 --> 00:01:32.480 
much into it I didn't think you could
only<00:01:31.259> thought<00:01:31.500> I<00:01:31.590> was<00:01:31.710> in<00:01:31.770> steering<00:01:32.159> wars<00:01:32.340> we

00:01:32.480 --> 00:01:32.490 
only thought I was in steering wars we

00:01:32.490 --> 00:01:34.550 
only thought I was in steering wars we
could<00:01:32.700> actually<00:01:32.820> change<00:01:33.119> the<00:01:33.240> saturation<00:01:33.840> of

00:01:34.550 --> 00:01:34.560 
could actually change the saturation of

00:01:34.560 --> 00:01:37.100 
could actually change the saturation of
the<00:01:34.619> steering<00:01:35.070> but<00:01:35.790> if<00:01:35.970> you<00:01:36.180> do<00:01:36.509> know<00:01:36.659> how<00:01:36.840> to

00:01:37.100 --> 00:01:37.110 
the steering but if you do know how to

00:01:37.110 --> 00:01:38.300 
the steering but if you do know how to
sort<00:01:37.409> of<00:01:37.470> customized<00:01:37.829> up<00:01:37.950> the<00:01:38.070> controller

00:01:38.300 --> 00:01:38.310 
sort of customized up the controller

00:01:38.310 --> 00:01:40.310 
sort of customized up the controller
that'd<00:01:39.090> be<00:01:39.119> nice<00:01:39.390> to<00:01:39.570> leave<00:01:39.659> down<00:01:39.869> the<00:01:40.020> comment

00:01:40.310 --> 00:01:40.320 
that'd be nice to leave down the comment

00:01:40.320 --> 00:01:43.190 
that'd be nice to leave down the comment
section<00:01:40.680> below<00:01:41.340> and<00:01:41.850> that's<00:01:42.540> one<00:01:42.720> thing<00:01:42.869> as

00:01:43.190 --> 00:01:43.200 
section below and that's one thing as

00:01:43.200 --> 00:01:45.260 
section below and that's one thing as
well<00:01:43.770> as<00:01:44.009> the<00:01:44.280> pad<00:01:44.520> they<00:01:44.790> said<00:01:45.000> they<00:01:45.210> were

00:01:45.260 --> 00:01:45.270 
well as the pad they said they were

00:01:45.270 --> 00:01:47.749 
well as the pad they said they were
going<00:01:45.360> to<00:01:45.420> improve<00:01:45.689> the<00:01:45.869> pad<00:01:46.259> vastly<00:01:46.979> and<00:01:47.189> for

00:01:47.749 --> 00:01:47.759 
going to improve the pad vastly and for

00:01:47.759 --> 00:01:49.460 
going to improve the pad vastly and for
me<00:01:47.880> I<00:01:47.909> still<00:01:48.299> think<00:01:48.509> the<00:01:48.600> pads<00:01:48.840> probably<00:01:49.200> worse

00:01:49.460 --> 00:01:49.470 
me I still think the pads probably worse

00:01:49.470 --> 00:01:51.859 
me I still think the pads probably worse
in<00:01:49.860> this<00:01:50.040> game<00:01:50.250> there<00:01:50.460> was<00:01:50.670> in<00:01:50.939> previous<00:01:51.659> games

00:01:51.859 --> 00:01:51.869 
in this game there was in previous games

00:01:51.869 --> 00:01:53.719 
in this game there was in previous games
and<00:01:52.200> that's<00:01:52.890> Sonny<00:01:53.100> for<00:01:53.310> me<00:01:53.430> because

00:01:53.719 --> 00:01:53.729 
and that's Sonny for me because

00:01:53.729 --> 00:01:54.830 
and that's Sonny for me because
obviously<00:01:53.909> the<00:01:54.210> steering<00:01:54.540> is<00:01:54.570> super

00:01:54.830 --> 00:01:54.840 
obviously the steering is super

00:01:54.840 --> 00:01:57.080 
obviously the steering is super
sensitive<00:01:55.200> and<00:01:55.530> it<00:01:56.100> just<00:01:56.250> just<00:01:56.610> doesn't<00:01:56.969> feel

00:01:57.080 --> 00:01:57.090 
sensitive and it just just doesn't feel

00:01:57.090 --> 00:01:59.330 
sensitive and it just just doesn't feel
as<00:01:57.360> so<00:01:57.719> real<00:01:58.110> it<00:01:58.320> not<00:01:58.500> it<00:01:58.680> obviously<00:01:58.950> feels

00:01:59.330 --> 00:01:59.340 
as so real it not it obviously feels

00:01:59.340 --> 00:02:01.310 
as so real it not it obviously feels
more<00:01:59.490> realistic<00:02:00.000> as<00:02:00.090> a<00:02:00.119> game<00:02:00.360> and<00:02:00.600> racing<00:02:01.259> a

00:02:01.310 --> 00:02:01.320 
more realistic as a game and racing a

00:02:01.320 --> 00:02:03.440 
more realistic as a game and racing a
Formula<00:02:01.649> One<00:02:01.680> car<00:02:01.829> but<00:02:02.280> it<00:02:02.670> just<00:02:02.820> doesn't<00:02:02.969> feel

00:02:03.440 --> 00:02:03.450 
Formula One car but it just doesn't feel

00:02:03.450 --> 00:02:05.330 
Formula One car but it just doesn't feel
right<00:02:03.509> when<00:02:04.320> you're<00:02:04.469> holding<00:02:04.770> it<00:02:04.890> in<00:02:04.950> the<00:02:05.100> pad

00:02:05.330 --> 00:02:05.340 
right when you're holding it in the pad

00:02:05.340 --> 00:02:07.459 
right when you're holding it in the pad
and<00:02:05.640> it's<00:02:06.240> still<00:02:06.450> like<00:02:06.630> the<00:02:06.780> controls<00:02:07.200> feel<00:02:07.409> a

00:02:07.459 --> 00:02:07.469 
and it's still like the controls feel a

00:02:07.469 --> 00:02:09.619 
and it's still like the controls feel a
little<00:02:07.649> bit<00:02:07.829> weird<00:02:08.099> and<00:02:08.340> I'm<00:02:08.970> not<00:02:09.149> too<00:02:09.450> sure

00:02:09.619 --> 00:02:09.629 
little bit weird and I'm not too sure

00:02:09.629 --> 00:02:10.999 
little bit weird and I'm not too sure
what<00:02:09.750> I<00:02:09.840> want<00:02:10.050> to<00:02:10.110> accomplish<00:02:10.170> you're<00:02:10.920> not

00:02:10.999 --> 00:02:11.009 
what I want to accomplish you're not

00:02:11.009 --> 00:02:13.340 
what I want to accomplish you're not
trying<00:02:11.220> to<00:02:11.340> improve<00:02:11.640> the<00:02:11.790> pad<00:02:11.970> vastly<00:02:12.540> I

00:02:13.340 --> 00:02:13.350 
trying to improve the pad vastly I

00:02:13.350 --> 00:02:15.050 
trying to improve the pad vastly I
I'd<00:02:13.410> person<00:02:13.770> who<00:02:13.860> would<00:02:14.160> go<00:02:14.400> towards<00:02:14.730> to<00:02:14.880> put

00:02:15.050 --> 00:02:15.060 
I'd person who would go towards to put

00:02:15.060 --> 00:02:16.970 
I'd person who would go towards to put
the<00:02:15.150> steering<00:02:15.360> wheels<00:02:15.630> and<00:02:15.930> more<00:02:16.110> hardcore

00:02:16.970 --> 00:02:16.980 
the steering wheels and more hardcore

00:02:16.980 --> 00:02:19.460 
the steering wheels and more hardcore
into<00:02:17.190> the<00:02:17.280> game<00:02:17.570> and<00:02:18.570> you<00:02:19.050> can<00:02:19.140> see<00:02:19.290> they're

00:02:19.460 --> 00:02:19.470 
into the game and you can see they're

00:02:19.470 --> 00:02:22.220 
into the game and you can see they're
super<00:02:19.860> late<00:02:20.010> move<00:02:20.220> into<00:02:20.970> that<00:02:21.090> corner<00:02:21.450> nearly

00:02:22.220 --> 00:02:22.230 
super late move into that corner nearly

00:02:22.230 --> 00:02:23.860 
super late move into that corner nearly
overtaken<00:02:22.800> matter<00:02:22.950> but<00:02:23.220> getting<00:02:23.430> it<00:02:23.520> wrong

00:02:23.860 --> 00:02:23.870 
overtaken matter but getting it wrong

00:02:23.870 --> 00:02:26.660 
overtaken matter but getting it wrong
totally<00:02:24.870> so<00:02:25.740> that's<00:02:25.890> the<00:02:25.980> steering<00:02:26.340> out<00:02:26.490> of

00:02:26.660 --> 00:02:26.670 
totally so that's the steering out of

00:02:26.670 --> 00:02:28.340 
totally so that's the steering out of
the<00:02:26.760> way<00:02:26.940> let's<00:02:26.970> talk<00:02:27.540> about<00:02:27.660> the<00:02:27.900> graphics

00:02:28.340 --> 00:02:28.350 
the way let's talk about the graphics

00:02:28.350 --> 00:02:29.930 
the way let's talk about the graphics
and<00:02:28.530> the<00:02:28.620> colors<00:02:29.400> and<00:02:29.520> all<00:02:29.580> that<00:02:29.730> good<00:02:29.880> stuff

00:02:29.930 --> 00:02:29.940 
and the colors and all that good stuff

00:02:29.940 --> 00:02:32.360 
and the colors and all that good stuff
now<00:02:30.900> I<00:02:30.930> have<00:02:31.110> edited<00:02:31.560> this<00:02:31.680> a<00:02:31.740> little<00:02:31.950> bit<00:02:32.190> in

00:02:32.360 --> 00:02:32.370 
now I have edited this a little bit in

00:02:32.370 --> 00:02:33.650 
now I have edited this a little bit in
Sony<00:02:32.610> Vegas<00:02:32.730> so<00:02:33.090> it<00:02:33.180> doesn't<00:02:33.420> look<00:02:33.510> exactly

00:02:33.650 --> 00:02:33.660 
Sony Vegas so it doesn't look exactly

00:02:33.660 --> 00:02:36.800 
Sony Vegas so it doesn't look exactly
like<00:02:34.020> this<00:02:34.290> in<00:02:34.530> the<00:02:34.770> game<00:02:34.980> by<00:02:35.610> can<00:02:35.910> and<00:02:36.210> I'm

00:02:36.800 --> 00:02:36.810 
like this in the game by can and I'm

00:02:36.810 --> 00:02:38.660 
like this in the game by can and I'm
pleased<00:02:37.260> to<00:02:37.320> report<00:02:37.410> that<00:02:37.860> the<00:02:38.130> colors<00:02:38.490> and

00:02:38.660 --> 00:02:38.670 
pleased to report that the colors and

00:02:38.670 --> 00:02:40.490 
pleased to report that the colors and
the<00:02:38.730> lighting<00:02:39.360> looks<00:02:39.690> a<00:02:39.840> lot<00:02:39.960> better<00:02:40.140> in<00:02:40.380> this

00:02:40.490 --> 00:02:40.500 
the lighting looks a lot better in this

00:02:40.500 --> 00:02:44.660 
the lighting looks a lot better in this
game<00:02:40.770> then<00:02:41.220> in<00:02:41.520> at<00:02:41.700> 2011<00:02:42.390> and<00:02:42.960> 2010<00:02:43.650> 2010<00:02:44.490> was

00:02:44.660 --> 00:02:44.670 
game then in at 2011 and 2010 2010 was

00:02:44.670 --> 00:02:46.550 
game then in at 2011 and 2010 2010 was
really<00:02:44.970> really<00:02:45.180> sort<00:02:45.480> riri<00:02:45.870> and<00:02:46.080> boring<00:02:46.410> to

00:02:46.550 --> 00:02:46.560 
really really sort riri and boring to

00:02:46.560 --> 00:02:48.830 
really really sort riri and boring to
watch<00:02:46.590> 2011<00:02:47.550> was<00:02:47.910> pretty<00:02:48.090> good<00:02:48.270> as<00:02:48.390> really

00:02:48.830 --> 00:02:48.840 
watch 2011 was pretty good as really

00:02:48.840 --> 00:02:50.240 
watch 2011 was pretty good as really
really<00:02:49.050> vibrant<00:02:49.290> colors<00:02:49.770> but<00:02:49.950> it's<00:02:50.100> really

00:02:50.240 --> 00:02:50.250 
really vibrant colors but it's really

00:02:50.250 --> 00:02:52.100 
really vibrant colors but it's really
the<00:02:50.340> lighting<00:02:50.850> and<00:02:50.940> stuff<00:02:51.060> wasn't<00:02:51.300> great<00:02:51.600> but

00:02:52.100 --> 00:02:52.110 
the lighting and stuff wasn't great but

00:02:52.110 --> 00:02:53.300 
the lighting and stuff wasn't great but
in<00:02:52.200> this<00:02:52.290> game<00:02:52.350> they<00:02:52.680> sort<00:02:52.860> of<00:02:52.920> pulled<00:02:53.100> it<00:02:53.190> all

00:02:53.300 --> 00:02:53.310 
in this game they sort of pulled it all

00:02:53.310 --> 00:02:54.770 
in this game they sort of pulled it all
together<00:02:53.490> they<00:02:53.760> took<00:02:53.970> the<00:02:54.120> good<00:02:54.390> stuff<00:02:54.630> over

00:02:54.770 --> 00:02:54.780 
together they took the good stuff over

00:02:54.780 --> 00:02:57.260 
together they took the good stuff over
everything<00:02:55.410> and<00:02:55.560> it<00:02:56.250> looks<00:02:56.580> pretty<00:02:56.940> good<00:02:57.240> i

00:02:57.260 --> 00:02:57.270 
everything and it looks pretty good i

00:02:57.270 --> 00:02:58.550 
everything and it looks pretty good i
mean<00:02:57.510> obviously<00:02:57.870> the<00:02:58.020> graphics<00:02:58.380> aren't

00:02:58.550 --> 00:02:58.560 
mean obviously the graphics aren't

00:02:58.560 --> 00:03:00.590 
mean obviously the graphics aren't
improving<00:02:58.950> that<00:02:59.790> much<00:03:00.060> from<00:03:00.270> year<00:03:00.420> to<00:03:00.450> year

00:03:00.590 --> 00:03:00.600 
improving that much from year to year

00:03:00.600 --> 00:03:03.860 
improving that much from year to year
because<00:03:00.810> of<00:03:00.990> the<00:03:01.170> xbox<00:03:01.500> and<00:03:01.920> ps3<00:03:02.300> but<00:03:03.300> for<00:03:03.540> pc

00:03:03.860 --> 00:03:03.870 
because of the xbox and ps3 but for pc

00:03:03.870 --> 00:03:05.240 
because of the xbox and ps3 but for pc
hopefully<00:03:04.530> you<00:03:04.590> can<00:03:04.650> go<00:03:04.800> and<00:03:04.890> check<00:03:05.040> out<00:03:05.220> some

00:03:05.240 --> 00:03:05.250 
hopefully you can go and check out some

00:03:05.250 --> 00:03:06.890 
hopefully you can go and check out some
gameplay<00:03:05.820> somewhere<00:03:06.180> on<00:03:06.270> youtube<00:03:06.660> and<00:03:06.870> you

00:03:06.890 --> 00:03:06.900 
gameplay somewhere on youtube and you

00:03:06.900 --> 00:03:09.350 
gameplay somewhere on youtube and you
can<00:03:07.380> see<00:03:07.530> the<00:03:07.560> gameplay<00:03:08.160> on<00:03:08.280> pcs<00:03:08.670> make<00:03:08.970> must<00:03:09.270> be

00:03:09.350 --> 00:03:09.360 
can see the gameplay on pcs make must be

00:03:09.360 --> 00:03:10.550 
can see the gameplay on pcs make must be
a<00:03:09.390> lot<00:03:09.660> better<00:03:09.840> because<00:03:10.110> they've<00:03:10.290> improved

00:03:10.550 --> 00:03:10.560 
a lot better because they've improved

00:03:10.560 --> 00:03:13.460 
a lot better because they've improved
the<00:03:10.770> graphics<00:03:11.330> immensely<00:03:12.330> and<00:03:12.510> the<00:03:12.960> lighting

00:03:13.460 --> 00:03:13.470 
the graphics immensely and the lighting

00:03:13.470 --> 00:03:15.980 
the graphics immensely and the lighting
and<00:03:13.620> the<00:03:13.680> colors<00:03:14.370> for<00:03:15.150> pc<00:03:15.480> it<00:03:15.720> will<00:03:15.810> just<00:03:15.930> be

00:03:15.980 --> 00:03:15.990 
and the colors for pc it will just be

00:03:15.990 --> 00:03:18.200 
and the colors for pc it will just be
amazing<00:03:16.920> and<00:03:17.010> hopefully<00:03:17.280> it's<00:03:17.370> better<00:03:17.550> or<00:03:17.940> as

00:03:18.200 --> 00:03:18.210 
amazing and hopefully it's better or as

00:03:18.210 --> 00:03:20.150 
amazing and hopefully it's better or as
good<00:03:18.540> as<00:03:18.750> all<00:03:18.930> factor<00:03:19.410> and<00:03:19.590> some<00:03:19.980> of<00:03:20.070> these

good as all factor and some of these

00:03:20.160 --> 00:03:22.820

trying<00:03:23.040> to<00:03:23.100> aim<00:03:23.250> to<00:03:23.460> be<00:03:23.640> but<00:03:24.240> you<00:03:24.750> can't<00:03:24.990> really

00:03:25.070 --> 00:03:25.080 
trying to aim to be but you can't really

00:03:25.080 --> 00:03:26.330 
trying to aim to be but you can't really
do<00:03:25.260> that<00:03:25.290> when<00:03:25.680> you're<00:03:25.770> not<00:03:25.860> really<00:03:26.070> aiming

00:03:26.330 --> 00:03:26.340 
do that when you're not really aiming

00:03:26.340 --> 00:03:28.550 
do that when you're not really aiming
for<00:03:26.760> the<00:03:26.790> realism<00:03:27.180> i<00:03:27.480> think<00:03:28.230> now<00:03:28.320> we<00:03:28.380> should

00:03:28.550 --> 00:03:28.560 
for the realism i think now we should

00:03:28.560 --> 00:03:29.990 
for the realism i think now we should
talk<00:03:28.740> about<00:03:28.800> realism<00:03:29.310> now<00:03:29.520> i<00:03:29.550> just<00:03:29.580> mentioned

00:03:29.990 --> 00:03:30.000 
talk about realism now i just mentioned

00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:31.670 
talk about realism now i just mentioned
it<00:03:30.090> at<00:03:30.210> the<00:03:30.360> end<00:03:30.450> of<00:03:30.630> that<00:03:30.810> I<00:03:31.080> think<00:03:31.590> the

00:03:31.670 --> 00:03:31.680 
it at the end of that I think the

00:03:31.680 --> 00:03:33.440 
it at the end of that I think the
realism<00:03:31.980> the<00:03:32.190> cars<00:03:32.460> really<00:03:32.790> is<00:03:32.940> a<00:03:33.000> bit<00:03:33.210> more

00:03:33.440 --> 00:03:33.450 
realism the cars really is a bit more

00:03:33.450 --> 00:03:35.600 
realism the cars really is a bit more
like<00:03:34.290> it<00:03:34.470> would<00:03:34.590> be<00:03:34.620> in<00:03:34.800> real<00:03:34.980> life<00:03:35.190> the<00:03:35.370> cars

00:03:35.600 --> 00:03:35.610 
like it would be in real life the cars

00:03:35.610 --> 00:03:37.580 
like it would be in real life the cars
really<00:03:35.940> really<00:03:36.330> sensitive<00:03:36.720> I<00:03:36.990> think<00:03:37.350> that's

00:03:37.580 --> 00:03:37.590 
really really sensitive I think that's

00:03:37.590 --> 00:03:39.590 
really really sensitive I think that's
just<00:03:37.650> a<00:03:37.920> pad<00:03:38.160> obviously<00:03:38.610> but<00:03:39.150> when<00:03:39.270> you<00:03:39.360> open

00:03:39.590 --> 00:03:39.600 
just a pad obviously but when you open

00:03:39.600 --> 00:03:41.330 
just a pad obviously but when you open
the<00:03:39.660> dr<00:03:39.810> estic<00:03:40.230> it's<00:03:40.410> like<00:03:40.560> shaking<00:03:40.980> about<00:03:41.190> and

00:03:41.330 --> 00:03:41.340 
the dr estic it's like shaking about and

00:03:41.340 --> 00:03:44.480 
the dr estic it's like shaking about and
you're<00:03:41.430> like<00:03:41.580> whoa<00:03:42.920> obviously<00:03:43.920> may<00:03:44.070> not<00:03:44.310> like

00:03:44.480 --> 00:03:44.490 
you're like whoa obviously may not like

00:03:44.490 --> 00:03:46.490 
you're like whoa obviously may not like
whoa<00:03:44.760> when<00:03:45.420> you're<00:03:45.540> holding<00:03:45.840> it<00:03:45.960> but<00:03:46.170> you<00:03:46.320> can

00:03:46.490 --> 00:03:46.500 
whoa when you're holding it but you can

00:03:46.500 --> 00:03:48.020 
whoa when you're holding it but you can
feel<00:03:46.530> it<00:03:46.920> you<00:03:47.040> that<00:03:47.160> you<00:03:47.280> don't<00:03:47.550> want<00:03:47.700> to<00:03:47.790> turn

00:03:48.020 --> 00:03:48.030 
feel it you that you don't want to turn

00:03:48.030 --> 00:03:50.420 
feel it you that you don't want to turn
in<00:03:48.270> really<00:03:48.690> with<00:03:49.050> vibrant<00:03:49.560> movements<00:03:50.070> you

00:03:50.420 --> 00:03:50.430 
in really with vibrant movements you

00:03:50.430 --> 00:03:53.420 
in really with vibrant movements you
want<00:03:50.640> to<00:03:50.760> sort<00:03:51.150> of<00:03:51.440> be<00:03:52.440> very<00:03:52.650> calm<00:03:53.010> with<00:03:53.340> the

want to sort of be very calm with the

00:03:53.430 --> 00:03:55.430 
want to sort of be very calm with the
steering<00:03:53.700> wheel<00:03:54.000> when<00:03:54.660> you're<00:03:54.870> got<00:03:55.260> Ben

00:03:55.430 --> 00:03:55.440 
steering wheel when you're got Ben

00:03:55.440 --> 00:03:56.750 
steering wheel when you're got Ben
you've<00:03:55.560> got<00:03:55.590> the<00:03:55.740> DRS<00:03:56.130> open<00:03:56.460> because<00:03:56.580> there

00:03:56.750 --> 00:03:56.760 
you've got the DRS open because there

00:03:56.760 --> 00:03:58.370 
you've got the DRS open because there
are<00:03:56.820> certain<00:03:57.090> tracks<00:03:57.360> and<00:03:57.600> certain<00:03:58.110> parts<00:03:58.320> of

00:03:58.370 --> 00:03:58.380 
are certain tracks and certain parts of

00:03:58.380 --> 00:04:00.380 
are certain tracks and certain parts of
this<00:03:58.500> track<00:03:58.770> where<00:03:59.340> you've<00:03:59.460> got<00:03:59.580> the<00:03:59.670> DRS<00:04:00.000> open

00:04:00.380 --> 00:04:00.390 
this track where you've got the DRS open

00:04:00.390 --> 00:04:01.970 
this track where you've got the DRS open
and<00:04:00.570> there's<00:04:00.720> a<00:04:00.780> corner<00:04:01.200> I<00:04:01.440> don't<00:04:01.710> really<00:04:01.860> know

00:04:01.970 --> 00:04:01.980 
and there's a corner I don't really know

00:04:01.980 --> 00:04:03.410 
and there's a corner I don't really know
what<00:04:02.100> your<00:04:02.190> call<00:04:02.340> this<00:04:02.460> corner<00:04:02.820> but<00:04:03.180> you<00:04:03.270> get

00:04:03.410 --> 00:04:03.420 
what your call this corner but you get

00:04:03.420 --> 00:04:05.150 
what your call this corner but you get
the<00:04:03.480> DRS<00:04:03.930> through<00:04:04.110> this<00:04:04.260> corner<00:04:04.680> and<00:04:04.980> you

00:04:05.150 --> 00:04:05.160 
the DRS through this corner and you

00:04:05.160 --> 00:04:06.590 
the DRS through this corner and you
don't<00:04:05.280> want<00:04:05.400> to<00:04:05.430> be<00:04:05.520> steering<00:04:05.820> too<00:04:06.000> much<00:04:06.240> into

00:04:06.590 --> 00:04:06.600 
don't want to be steering too much into

00:04:06.600 --> 00:04:08.480 
don't want to be steering too much into
the<00:04:06.690> corner<00:04:06.990> with<00:04:07.350> the<00:04:07.470> DRS<00:04:07.800> open<00:04:08.130> because<00:04:08.310> you

00:04:08.480 --> 00:04:08.490 
the corner with the DRS open because you

00:04:08.490 --> 00:04:11.180 
the corner with the DRS open because you
could<00:04:08.610> spin<00:04:08.880> the<00:04:09.030> car<00:04:09.270> and<00:04:10.010> overall<00:04:11.010> I<00:04:11.040> think

00:04:11.180 --> 00:04:11.190 
could spin the car and overall I think

00:04:11.190 --> 00:04:12.620 
could spin the car and overall I think
the<00:04:11.280> car<00:04:11.520> really<00:04:11.880> feels<00:04:12.120> a<00:04:12.210> little<00:04:12.330> bit<00:04:12.480> more

00:04:12.620 --> 00:04:12.630 
the car really feels a little bit more

00:04:12.630 --> 00:04:14.030 
the car really feels a little bit more
realistic<00:04:12.870> obviously<00:04:13.410> I<00:04:13.440> haven't<00:04:13.590> driven<00:04:13.800> an

00:04:14.030 --> 00:04:14.040 
realistic obviously I haven't driven an

00:04:14.040 --> 00:04:16.880 
realistic obviously I haven't driven an
f1<00:04:14.370> car<00:04:14.400> but<00:04:15.000> I've<00:04:15.060> driven<00:04:15.270> go<00:04:15.540> cards<00:04:15.990> and<00:04:16.200> it's

00:04:16.880 --> 00:04:16.890 
f1 car but I've driven go cards and it's

00:04:16.890 --> 00:04:20.420 
f1 car but I've driven go cards and it's
a<00:04:17.010> little<00:04:17.130> bit<00:04:17.310> like<00:04:17.670> it<00:04:17.820> i<00:04:17.910> suppose<00:04:17.970> and<00:04:19.430> dead

00:04:20.420 --> 00:04:20.430 
a little bit like it i suppose and dead

00:04:20.430 --> 00:04:22.580 
a little bit like it i suppose and dead
you<00:04:20.700> sure<00:04:20.850> that<00:04:21.060> hamilton<00:04:21.720> retired<00:04:22.229> from<00:04:22.500> the

00:04:22.580 --> 00:04:22.590 
you sure that hamilton retired from the

00:04:22.590 --> 00:04:24.770 
you sure that hamilton retired from the
race<00:04:22.860> and<00:04:23.190> obviously<00:04:24.180> there<00:04:24.360> isn't<00:04:24.450> safety

00:04:24.770 --> 00:04:24.780 
race and obviously there isn't safety

00:04:24.780 --> 00:04:26.780 
race and obviously there isn't safety
cars<00:04:24.960> and<00:04:25.200> damaging<00:04:25.650> the<00:04:25.740> demo<00:04:26.040> but<00:04:26.250> Hamilton

00:04:26.780 --> 00:04:26.790 
cars and damaging the demo but Hamilton

00:04:26.790 --> 00:04:29.000 
cars and damaging the demo but Hamilton
tired<00:04:27.090> from<00:04:27.210> the<00:04:27.450> race<00:04:27.660> I<00:04:27.900> think<00:04:28.140> there<00:04:28.650> we<00:04:28.800> had

00:04:29.000 --> 00:04:29.010 
tired from the race I think there we had

00:04:29.010 --> 00:04:30.800 
tired from the race I think there we had
something<00:04:29.250> wrong<00:04:29.490> with<00:04:29.610> this<00:04:29.730> car<00:04:29.940> and<00:04:30.240> it

00:04:30.800 --> 00:04:30.810 
something wrong with this car and it

00:04:30.810 --> 00:04:32.240 
something wrong with this car and it
worked<00:04:31.020> out<00:04:31.170> the<00:04:31.260> yellow<00:04:31.410> flags<00:04:31.740> and<00:04:32.040> all<00:04:32.130> the

00:04:32.240 --> 00:04:32.250 
worked out the yellow flags and all the

00:04:32.250 --> 00:04:34.100 
worked out the yellow flags and all the
cars<00:04:32.490> went<00:04:32.730> into<00:04:33.060> formation<00:04:33.390> nobody<00:04:33.930> ever

00:04:34.100 --> 00:04:34.110 
cars went into formation nobody ever

00:04:34.110 --> 00:04:36.140 
cars went into formation nobody ever
took<00:04:34.350> and<00:04:34.620> i<00:04:35.220> remember<00:04:35.280> in<00:04:35.580> previous<00:04:35.970> games

00:04:36.140 --> 00:04:36.150 
took and i remember in previous games

00:04:36.150 --> 00:04:37.850 
took and i remember in previous games
with<00:04:36.390> a<00:04:36.420> yellow<00:04:36.600> flag<00:04:36.870> without<00:04:37.020> a<00:04:37.320> i<00:04:37.380> still

00:04:37.850 --> 00:04:37.860 
with a yellow flag without a i still

00:04:37.860 --> 00:04:40.460 
with a yellow flag without a i still
overtook<00:04:38.340> and<00:04:38.580> all<00:04:38.640> that<00:04:38.790> stuff<00:04:38.940> so<00:04:39.170> it's<00:04:40.170> good

00:04:40.460 --> 00:04:40.470 
overtook and all that stuff so it's good

00:04:40.470 --> 00:04:41.990 
overtook and all that stuff so it's good
that<00:04:40.620> they've<00:04:40.740> actually<00:04:40.890> finally<00:04:41.460> made<00:04:41.610> it<00:04:41.790> so

00:04:41.990 --> 00:04:42.000 
that they've actually finally made it so

00:04:42.000 --> 00:04:43.880 
that they've actually finally made it so
the<00:04:42.630> AI<00:04:42.720> actually<00:04:43.050> respond<00:04:43.590> to<00:04:43.680> the<00:04:43.770> yellow

00:04:43.880 --> 00:04:43.890 
the AI actually respond to the yellow

00:04:43.890 --> 00:04:46.160 
the AI actually respond to the yellow
flags<00:04:44.190> and<00:04:44.460> I<00:04:44.850> think<00:04:45.060> if<00:04:45.180> I<00:04:45.330> overtook<00:04:45.720> somebody

00:04:46.160 --> 00:04:46.170 
flags and I think if I overtook somebody

00:04:46.170 --> 00:04:47.360 
flags and I think if I overtook somebody
in<00:04:46.230> the<00:04:46.290> yellow<00:04:46.470> flags<00:04:46.740> now<00:04:46.950> I'd<00:04:47.130> get<00:04:47.340> a

00:04:47.360 --> 00:04:47.370 
in the yellow flags now I'd get a

00:04:47.370 --> 00:04:49.310 
in the yellow flags now I'd get a
penalty<00:04:47.640> which<00:04:48.390> is<00:04:48.540> a<00:04:48.570> good<00:04:48.750> thing<00:04:48.810> to<00:04:49.020> add<00:04:49.290> to

00:04:49.310 --> 00:04:49.320 
penalty which is a good thing to add to

00:04:49.320 --> 00:04:52.310 
penalty which is a good thing to add to
the<00:04:49.530> realism<00:04:49.680> and<00:04:50.190> so<00:04:51.090> real<00:04:51.360> that's<00:04:51.930> why<00:04:52.050> wont

00:04:52.310 --> 00:04:52.320 
the realism and so real that's why wont

00:04:52.320 --> 00:04:53.810 
the realism and so real that's why wont
in<00:04:52.470> the<00:04:52.560> game<00:04:52.740> is<00:04:52.860> it<00:04:53.010> to<00:04:53.130> be<00:04:53.220> a<00:04:53.250> bit<00:04:53.490> like<00:04:53.670> the

00:04:53.810 --> 00:04:53.820 
in the game is it to be a bit like the

00:04:53.820 --> 00:04:55.310 
in the game is it to be a bit like the
actual<00:04:54.090> f1<00:04:54.450> I<00:04:54.480> mean<00:04:54.690> I<00:04:54.720> realize<00:04:55.050> it's<00:04:55.200> not

00:04:55.310 --> 00:04:55.320 
actual f1 I mean I realize it's not

00:04:55.320 --> 00:04:57.530 
actual f1 I mean I realize it's not
going<00:04:55.410> to<00:04:55.500> be<00:04:55.560> a<00:04:55.590> super<00:04:55.950> sim<00:04:56.160> on<00:04:56.400> xbox<00:04:56.910> but<00:04:57.300> i

00:04:57.530 --> 00:04:57.540 
going to be a super sim on xbox but i

00:04:57.540 --> 00:05:00.110 
going to be a super sim on xbox but i
just<00:04:58.440> want<00:04:58.590> those<00:04:58.770> little<00:04:59.070> things<00:04:59.100> and<00:04:59.550> it<00:04:59.940> is

00:05:00.110 --> 00:05:00.120 
just want those little things and it is

00:05:00.120 --> 00:05:02.390 
just want those little things and it is
those<00:05:00.270> little<00:05:00.630> things<00:05:00.660> of<00:05:01.020> May<00:05:01.170> 2012<00:05:01.680> a<00:05:02.070> vast

00:05:02.390 --> 00:05:02.400 
those little things of May 2012 a vast

00:05:02.400 --> 00:05:04.460 
those little things of May 2012 a vast
improvement<00:05:02.640> on<00:05:03.000> 2011<00:05:03.600> because<00:05:04.200> when<00:05:04.380> you

00:05:04.460 --> 00:05:04.470 
improvement on 2011 because when you

00:05:04.470 --> 00:05:06.530 
improvement on 2011 because when you
really<00:05:04.770> think<00:05:04.800> about<00:05:05.070> it<00:05:05.250> 2012<00:05:06.030> isn't<00:05:06.240> really

00:05:06.530 --> 00:05:06.540 
really think about it 2012 isn't really

00:05:06.540 --> 00:05:09.110 
really think about it 2012 isn't really
a<00:05:06.570> huge<00:05:06.840> improvement<00:05:07.470> on<00:05:07.560> 2011<00:05:08.550> but<00:05:08.670> the<00:05:08.820> small

00:05:09.110 --> 00:05:09.120 
a huge improvement on 2011 but the small

00:05:09.120 --> 00:05:10.400 
a huge improvement on 2011 but the small
things<00:05:09.150> that<00:05:09.450> they<00:05:09.600> have<00:05:09.690> done<00:05:09.720> to<00:05:09.960> the<00:05:10.200> game

00:05:10.400 --> 00:05:10.410 
things that they have done to the game

00:05:10.410 --> 00:05:13.430 
things that they have done to the game
the<00:05:10.830> lighting<00:05:11.340> the<00:05:11.820> colors<00:05:12.330> that<00:05:12.840> make<00:05:13.020> it<00:05:13.290> so

00:05:13.430 --> 00:05:13.440 
the lighting the colors that make it so

00:05:13.440 --> 00:05:15.290 
the lighting the colors that make it so
the<00:05:13.590> DRS<00:05:13.920> is<00:05:14.070> more<00:05:14.220> realistic<00:05:14.580> at<00:05:14.970> the<00:05:15.060> core

00:05:15.290 --> 00:05:15.300 
the DRS is more realistic at the core

00:05:15.300 --> 00:05:17.210 
the DRS is more realistic at the core
turns<00:05:15.900> in<00:05:16.020> a<00:05:16.050> bit<00:05:16.230> more<00:05:16.380> realistic<00:05:16.560> the

00:05:17.210 --> 00:05:17.220 
turns in a bit more realistic the

00:05:17.220 --> 00:05:20.060 
turns in a bit more realistic the
steering<00:05:17.640> wheel<00:05:17.880> not<00:05:18.240> turning<00:05:18.660> as<00:05:18.750> much<00:05:19.070> they

00:05:20.060 --> 00:05:20.070 
steering wheel not turning as much they

00:05:20.070 --> 00:05:22.310 
steering wheel not turning as much they
add<00:05:20.310> to<00:05:20.460> the<00:05:20.550> game<00:05:20.760> immensely<00:05:21.210> without<00:05:22.080> really

00:05:22.310 --> 00:05:22.320 
add to the game immensely without really

00:05:22.320 --> 00:05:24.110 
add to the game immensely without really
having<00:05:22.740> to<00:05:22.950> put<00:05:23.100> a<00:05:23.130> huge<00:05:23.370> amount<00:05:23.430> of<00:05:23.700> effort<00:05:23.850> in

00:05:24.110 --> 00:05:24.120 
having to put a huge amount of effort in

00:05:24.120 --> 00:05:26.750 
having to put a huge amount of effort in
and<00:05:24.470> it<00:05:25.470> could<00:05:25.680> have<00:05:25.770> been<00:05:25.890> 2011<00:05:26.550> that<00:05:26.670> was

00:05:26.750 --> 00:05:26.760 
and it could have been 2011 that was

00:05:26.760 --> 00:05:28.430 
and it could have been 2011 that was
this<00:05:26.940> amazing<00:05:27.150> game<00:05:27.480> but<00:05:27.630> I<00:05:27.660> think<00:05:27.900> 2012<00:05:28.380> is

00:05:28.430 --> 00:05:28.440 
this amazing game but I think 2012 is

00:05:28.440 --> 00:05:30.710 
this amazing game but I think 2012 is
going<00:05:28.590> to<00:05:28.650> be<00:05:28.740> an<00:05:28.800> amazing<00:05:29.130> game<00:05:29.310> and<00:05:29.490> I<00:05:30.390> wanna

00:05:30.710 --> 00:05:30.720 
going to be an amazing game and I wanna

00:05:30.720 --> 00:05:32.360 
going to be an amazing game and I wanna
take<00:05:30.930> a<00:05:30.960> guess<00:05:31.050> and<00:05:31.380> say<00:05:31.470> the<00:05:31.740> online<00:05:32.130> is<00:05:32.340> going

00:05:32.360 --> 00:05:32.370 
take a guess and say the online is going

00:05:32.370 --> 00:05:33.740 
take a guess and say the online is going
to<00:05:32.550> be<00:05:32.640> a<00:05:32.670> lot<00:05:32.880> better<00:05:33.030> this<00:05:33.240> year<00:05:33.300> because

00:05:33.740 --> 00:05:33.750 
to be a lot better this year because

00:05:33.750 --> 00:05:36.110 
to be a lot better this year because
when<00:05:34.260> you<00:05:34.350> go<00:05:34.650> on<00:05:34.710> the<00:05:34.860> grass<00:05:35.130> in<00:05:35.430> this<00:05:35.550> demo<00:05:35.910> or

00:05:36.110 --> 00:05:36.120 
when you go on the grass in this demo or

00:05:36.120 --> 00:05:37.700 
when you go on the grass in this demo or
when<00:05:36.240> you<00:05:36.330> go<00:05:36.570> off<00:05:36.660> the<00:05:36.810> track<00:05:36.840> in<00:05:37.320> this<00:05:37.500> demo

00:05:37.700 --> 00:05:37.710 
when you go off the track in this demo

00:05:37.710 --> 00:05:40.250 
when you go off the track in this demo
you<00:05:38.220> actually<00:05:38.520> get<00:05:38.700> sore<00:05:39.030> slow<00:05:39.540> down<00:05:39.810> by<00:05:40.200> the

00:05:40.250 --> 00:05:40.260 
you actually get sore slow down by the

00:05:40.260 --> 00:05:42.680 
you actually get sore slow down by the
computer<00:05:40.920> system<00:05:41.310> this<00:05:41.820> makes<00:05:42.060> me<00:05:42.240> think<00:05:42.570> that

00:05:42.680 --> 00:05:42.690 
computer system this makes me think that

00:05:42.690 --> 00:05:44.450 
computer system this makes me think that
in<00:05:43.020> online<00:05:43.200> it<00:05:43.650> will<00:05:43.680> do<00:05:43.920> this<00:05:44.130> when<00:05:44.340> you

00:05:44.450 --> 00:05:44.460 
in online it will do this when you

00:05:44.460 --> 00:05:45.920 
in online it will do this when you
automatically<00:05:45.060> try<00:05:45.240> and<00:05:45.360> cut<00:05:45.510> a<00:05:45.540> corner<00:05:45.780> to

00:05:45.920 --> 00:05:45.930 
automatically try and cut a corner to

00:05:45.930 --> 00:05:47.690 
automatically try and cut a corner to
get<00:05:46.050> ahead<00:05:46.230> of<00:05:46.290> people<00:05:46.650> this<00:05:47.280> will<00:05:47.460> be<00:05:47.550> good

00:05:47.690 --> 00:05:47.700 
get ahead of people this will be good

00:05:47.700 --> 00:05:49.400 
get ahead of people this will be good
because<00:05:48.210> it<00:05:48.390> means<00:05:48.450> it<00:05:48.780> will<00:05:48.870> stop<00:05:49.110> people

00:05:49.400 --> 00:05:49.410 
because it means it will stop people

00:05:49.410 --> 00:05:51.500 
because it means it will stop people
ramming<00:05:49.770> into<00:05:49.890> each<00:05:50.070> other<00:05:50.310> and<00:05:50.580> I've<00:05:51.360> always

00:05:51.500 --> 00:05:51.510 
ramming into each other and I've always

00:05:51.510 --> 00:05:53.330 
ramming into each other and I've always
liked<00:05:51.840> this<00:05:51.930> idea<00:05:52.110> of<00:05:52.350> having<00:05:52.470> a<00:05:52.650> realistic

00:05:53.330 --> 00:05:53.340 
liked this idea of having a realistic

00:05:53.340 --> 00:05:54.920 
liked this idea of having a realistic
damage<00:05:53.700> model<00:05:54.030> online<00:05:54.180> to<00:05:54.600> stop<00:05:54.810> people

00:05:54.920 --> 00:05:54.930 
damage model online to stop people

00:05:54.930 --> 00:05:57.320 
damage model online to stop people
crashing<00:05:55.530> but<00:05:56.040> then<00:05:56.160> that<00:05:56.190> is<00:05:56.430> unfair<00:05:56.850> on<00:05:57.150> the

00:05:57.320 --> 00:05:57.330 
crashing but then that is unfair on the

00:05:57.330 --> 00:06:00.350 
crashing but then that is unfair on the
people<00:05:57.660> that<00:05:58.200> really<00:05:58.920> had<00:05:59.520> no<00:05:59.700> fool<00:06:00.000> their<00:06:00.180> own

00:06:00.350 --> 00:06:00.360 
people that really had no fool their own

00:06:00.360 --> 00:06:02.510 
people that really had no fool their own
but<00:06:00.570> they<00:06:00.600> still<00:06:00.810> got<00:06:00.960> crashed<00:06:01.200> into<00:06:01.490> so<00:06:02.490> I

00:06:02.510 --> 00:06:02.520 
but they still got crashed into so I

00:06:02.520 --> 00:06:04.190 
but they still got crashed into so I
think<00:06:02.640> we've<00:06:02.820> talked<00:06:03.030> about<00:06:03.150> most<00:06:03.540> things<00:06:03.690> in

00:06:04.190 --> 00:06:04.200 
think we've talked about most things in

00:06:04.200 --> 00:06:06.710 
think we've talked about most things in
this<00:06:04.710> video<00:06:05.100> and<00:06:05.460> obviously<00:06:06.180> the<00:06:06.360> replay

00:06:06.710 --> 00:06:06.720 
this video and obviously the replay

00:06:06.720 --> 00:06:08.240 
this video and obviously the replay
cameras<00:06:07.080> is<00:06:07.230> something<00:06:07.500> I've<00:06:07.620> liked<00:06:07.920> as<00:06:08.040> well

00:06:08.240 --> 00:06:08.250 
cameras is something I've liked as well

00:06:08.250 --> 00:06:10.220 
cameras is something I've liked as well
it's<00:06:08.730> a<00:06:08.820> bit<00:06:09.000> of<00:06:09.060> an<00:06:09.120> improvement<00:06:09.270> on<00:06:09.600> 2011

00:06:10.220 --> 00:06:10.230 
it's a bit of an improvement on 2011

00:06:10.230 --> 00:06:11.660 
it's a bit of an improvement on 2011
it's<00:06:10.410> a<00:06:10.500> shame<00:06:10.710> that<00:06:10.740> you<00:06:10.920> can't<00:06:11.100> go<00:06:11.280> from<00:06:11.400> car

00:06:11.660 --> 00:06:11.670 
it's a shame that you can't go from car

00:06:11.670 --> 00:06:13.220 
it's a shame that you can't go from car
to<00:06:11.700> car<00:06:11.850> I<00:06:12.300> don't<00:06:12.750> know<00:06:12.810> whether<00:06:12.900> that's<00:06:12.990> just

00:06:13.220 --> 00:06:13.230 
to car I don't know whether that's just

00:06:13.230 --> 00:06:14.540 
to car I don't know whether that's just
a<00:06:13.290> demo<00:06:13.560> but<00:06:13.770> I<00:06:13.800> assume<00:06:14.100> it<00:06:14.190> will<00:06:14.250> be<00:06:14.400> in<00:06:14.490> the

00:06:14.540 --> 00:06:14.550 
a demo but I assume it will be in the

00:06:14.550 --> 00:06:15.740 
a demo but I assume it will be in the
full<00:06:14.730> game<00:06:14.880> as<00:06:15.030> well<00:06:15.180> where<00:06:15.360> you<00:06:15.450> can't

00:06:15.740 --> 00:06:15.750 
full game as well where you can't

00:06:15.750 --> 00:06:17.870 
full game as well where you can't
actually<00:06:15.960> go<00:06:16.170> from<00:06:16.350> car<00:06:16.560> to<00:06:16.590> car<00:06:16.880> but

00:06:17.870 --> 00:06:17.880 
actually go from car to car but

00:06:17.880 --> 00:06:19.340 
actually go from car to car but
obviously<00:06:18.420> the<00:06:18.570> replay<00:06:18.840> camera<00:06:19.110> is<00:06:19.170> a<00:06:19.230> lot

00:06:19.340 --> 00:06:19.350 
obviously the replay camera is a lot

00:06:19.350 --> 00:06:21.350 
obviously the replay camera is a lot
nicer<00:06:19.380> the<00:06:19.800> tcam<00:06:20.220> is<00:06:20.490> a<00:06:20.550> nice<00:06:20.790> feature<00:06:21.060> to

00:06:21.350 --> 00:06:21.360 
nicer the tcam is a nice feature to

00:06:21.360 --> 00:06:22.880 
nicer the tcam is a nice feature to
watch<00:06:21.660> back<00:06:21.990> but<00:06:22.230> i<00:06:22.260> certainly<00:06:22.470> don't<00:06:22.710> like

00:06:22.880 --> 00:06:22.890 
watch back but i certainly don't like

00:06:22.890 --> 00:06:24.920 
watch back but i certainly don't like
racing<00:06:23.340> on<00:06:23.580> it<00:06:23.790> the<00:06:23.970> offset<00:06:24.270> t<00:06:24.390> can<00:06:24.630> that<00:06:24.780> is

00:06:24.920 --> 00:06:24.930 
racing on it the offset t can that is

00:06:24.930 --> 00:06:27.560 
racing on it the offset t can that is
and<00:06:25.760> what<00:06:26.760> i<00:06:26.790> want<00:06:26.850> to<00:06:26.970> do<00:06:27.030> is<00:06:27.060> just<00:06:27.150> sort<00:06:27.450> give

00:06:27.560 --> 00:06:27.570 
and what i want to do is just sort give

00:06:27.570 --> 00:06:30.500 
and what i want to do is just sort give
my<00:06:27.720> overall<00:06:28.170> view<00:06:28.590> on<00:06:28.830> the<00:06:28.980> game<00:06:29.330> so<00:06:30.330> we've<00:06:30.480> had

00:06:30.500 --> 00:06:30.510 
my overall view on the game so we've had

00:06:30.510 --> 00:06:33.560 
my overall view on the game so we've had
it<00:06:30.780> about<00:06:31.050> 24<00:06:31.920> hours<00:06:32.190> now<00:06:32.370> just<00:06:32.940> over<00:06:33.150> 24<00:06:33.540> hours

00:06:33.560 --> 00:06:33.570 
it about 24 hours now just over 24 hours

00:06:33.570 --> 00:06:36.800 
it about 24 hours now just over 24 hours
really<00:06:33.930> and<00:06:34.580> I<00:06:35.580> want<00:06:36.240> to<00:06:36.270> give<00:06:36.419> my<00:06:36.510> honest

00:06:36.800 --> 00:06:36.810 
really and I want to give my honest

00:06:36.810 --> 00:06:39.200 
really and I want to give my honest
opinion<00:06:37.230> on<00:06:37.380> it<00:06:37.500> and<00:06:37.650> to<00:06:38.220> give<00:06:38.430> it<00:06:38.550> a<00:06:38.669> fair

00:06:39.200 --> 00:06:39.210 
opinion on it and to give it a fair

00:06:39.210 --> 00:06:42.140 
opinion on it and to give it a fair
marking<00:06:39.660> out<00:06:39.840> of<00:06:40.229> 10<00:06:40.470> so<00:06:41.370> overall<00:06:41.639> if<00:06:41.880> we<00:06:42.030> look

00:06:42.140 --> 00:06:42.150 
marking out of 10 so overall if we look

00:06:42.150 --> 00:06:43.820 
marking out of 10 so overall if we look
at<00:06:42.210> this<00:06:42.360> demo<00:06:42.630> and<00:06:43.020> I<00:06:43.080> assume<00:06:43.380> the<00:06:43.530> game<00:06:43.680> is

00:06:43.820 --> 00:06:43.830 
at this demo and I assume the game is

00:06:43.830 --> 00:06:45.260 
at this demo and I assume the game is
going<00:06:43.919> to<00:06:43.979> be<00:06:44.069> pretty<00:06:44.370> similar<00:06:44.669> to<00:06:44.940> this<00:06:45.060> in

00:06:45.260 --> 00:06:45.270 
going to be pretty similar to this in

00:06:45.270 --> 00:06:47.749 
going to be pretty similar to this in
most<00:06:45.479> areas<00:06:45.690> we<00:06:46.259> look<00:06:46.410> at<00:06:46.500> that<00:06:46.650> AI<00:06:46.830> the<00:06:47.069> colors

00:06:47.749 --> 00:06:47.759 
most areas we look at that AI the colors

00:06:47.759 --> 00:06:51.080 
most areas we look at that AI the colors
of<00:06:47.789> game<00:06:48.150> the<00:06:48.360> lighting<00:06:48.780> of<00:06:48.900> the<00:06:48.930> game<00:06:49.680> and<00:06:50.090> the

00:06:51.080 --> 00:06:51.090 
of game the lighting of the game and the

00:06:51.090 --> 00:06:52.820 
of game the lighting of the game and the
responsive<00:06:51.810> of<00:06:51.930> the<00:06:52.050> steering<00:06:52.349> wheel<00:06:52.530> and<00:06:52.710> all

00:06:52.820 --> 00:06:52.830 
responsive of the steering wheel and all

00:06:52.830 --> 00:06:54.589 
responsive of the steering wheel and all
that<00:06:52.979> stuff<00:06:53.069> let's<00:06:53.490> put<00:06:53.699> it<00:06:53.789> all<00:06:53.880> into<00:06:54.060> one<00:06:54.180> and

00:06:54.589 --> 00:06:54.599 
that stuff let's put it all into one and

00:06:54.599 --> 00:06:58.100 
that stuff let's put it all into one and
give<00:06:55.169> it<00:06:55.199> a<00:06:55.410> fair<00:06:55.710> rating<00:06:56.610> out<00:06:56.849> of<00:06:56.880> 10<00:06:57.060> I<00:06:57.569> think

00:06:58.100 --> 00:06:58.110 
give it a fair rating out of 10 I think

00:06:58.110 --> 00:06:59.600 
give it a fair rating out of 10 I think
it<00:06:58.199> is<00:06:58.229> pretty<00:06:58.500> obvious<00:06:58.620> to<00:06:59.160> say<00:06:59.310> that<00:06:59.490> this

00:06:59.600 --> 00:06:59.610 
it is pretty obvious to say that this

00:06:59.610 --> 00:07:02.270 
it is pretty obvious to say that this
game<00:06:59.849> isn't<00:07:00.090> a<00:07:00.330> nine<00:07:00.569> or<00:07:00.599> eight<00:07:01.080> or<00:07:01.530> a<00:07:01.560> ten<00:07:01.740> out

00:07:02.270 --> 00:07:02.280 
game isn't a nine or eight or a ten out

00:07:02.280 --> 00:07:04.640 
game isn't a nine or eight or a ten out
tender<00:07:02.669> that<00:07:02.819> made<00:07:02.970> any<00:07:03.090> sense<00:07:03.210> I<00:07:03.660> went<00:07:04.199> to<00:07:04.319> a<00:07:04.349> 9

00:07:04.640 --> 00:07:04.650 
tender that made any sense I went to a 9

00:07:04.650 --> 00:07:06.710 
tender that made any sense I went to a 9
or<00:07:04.680> 10<00:07:04.979> out<00:07:05.160> of<00:07:05.190> 10<00:07:05.400> because<00:07:05.970> it<00:07:06.330> really<00:07:06.479> has

00:07:06.710 --> 00:07:06.720 
or 10 out of 10 because it really has

00:07:06.720 --> 00:07:08.659 
or 10 out of 10 because it really has
some<00:07:06.960> flaws<00:07:07.319> which<00:07:07.680> a<00:07:07.800> little<00:07:07.949> bit<00:07:08.220> annoying

00:07:08.659 --> 00:07:08.669 
some flaws which a little bit annoying

00:07:08.669 --> 00:07:11.960 
some flaws which a little bit annoying
where<00:07:09.539> the<00:07:09.569> AI<00:07:10.289> is<00:07:10.620> just<00:07:10.830> kind<00:07:11.370> of<00:07:11.460> easy<00:07:11.639> on<00:07:11.849> the

00:07:11.960 --> 00:07:11.970 
where the AI is just kind of easy on the

00:07:11.970 --> 00:07:14.659 
where the AI is just kind of easy on the
hard<00:07:12.180> mode<00:07:12.449> and<00:07:12.720> if<00:07:13.530> it's<00:07:13.740> really<00:07:14.220> really<00:07:14.520> like

00:07:14.659 --> 00:07:14.669 
hard mode and if it's really really like

00:07:14.669 --> 00:07:16.610 
hard mode and if it's really really like
this<00:07:14.849> for<00:07:15.000> all<00:07:15.060> of<00:07:15.180> the<00:07:15.389> season<00:07:16.139> challenging

00:07:16.610 --> 00:07:16.620 
this for all of the season challenging

00:07:16.620 --> 00:07:18.140 
this for all of the season challenging
it's<00:07:16.770> gonna<00:07:16.889> be<00:07:17.009> a<00:07:17.070> bit<00:07:17.220> disappointing<00:07:17.880> but

00:07:18.140 --> 00:07:18.150 
it's gonna be a bit disappointing but

00:07:18.150 --> 00:07:20.360 
it's gonna be a bit disappointing but
you<00:07:18.960> know<00:07:19.080> it's<00:07:19.440> their<00:07:19.620> game<00:07:19.650> obviously<00:07:20.160> they

00:07:20.360 --> 00:07:20.370 
you know it's their game obviously they

00:07:20.370 --> 00:07:21.589 
you know it's their game obviously they
realized<00:07:20.669> that<00:07:20.729> a<00:07:20.820> lot<00:07:21.000> of<00:07:21.030> people<00:07:21.180> who<00:07:21.389> can<00:07:21.509> be

00:07:21.589 --> 00:07:21.599 
realized that a lot of people who can be

00:07:21.599 --> 00:07:22.999 
realized that a lot of people who can be
coming<00:07:21.870> into<00:07:22.110> this<00:07:22.199> game<00:07:22.380> and<00:07:22.590> maybe<00:07:22.680> not

00:07:22.999 --> 00:07:23.009 
coming into this game and maybe not

00:07:23.009 --> 00:07:26.570 
coming into this game and maybe not
going<00:07:23.130> to<00:07:23.190> be<00:07:23.250> great<00:07:23.490> at<00:07:23.669> the<00:07:23.759> game<00:07:24.470> but<00:07:25.550> yeah<00:07:26.550> I

00:07:26.570 --> 00:07:26.580 
going to be great at the game but yeah I

00:07:26.580 --> 00:07:28.129 
going to be great at the game but yeah I
think<00:07:26.669> overall<00:07:27.449> i'm<00:07:27.570> gonna<00:07:27.720> have<00:07:27.840> to<00:07:27.870> give<00:07:28.050> it

00:07:28.129 --> 00:07:28.139 
think overall i'm gonna have to give it

00:07:28.139 --> 00:07:30.710 
think overall i'm gonna have to give it
a<00:07:28.229> seven<00:07:28.620> out<00:07:28.889> of<00:07:28.919> 10<00:07:29.280> for<00:07:29.580> the<00:07:30.060> fact<00:07:30.330> that<00:07:30.449> the

00:07:30.710 --> 00:07:30.720 
a seven out of 10 for the fact that the

00:07:30.720 --> 00:07:32.270 
a seven out of 10 for the fact that the
AI<00:07:30.870> really<00:07:31.440> wasn't<00:07:31.710> great<00:07:31.889> in<00:07:32.009> the<00:07:32.099> young

00:07:32.270 --> 00:07:32.280 
AI really wasn't great in the young

00:07:32.280 --> 00:07:34.999 
AI really wasn't great in the young
drivers<00:07:32.669> test<00:07:32.909> all<00:07:33.570> this<00:07:33.900> monza<00:07:34.349> race<00:07:34.560> either

00:07:34.999 --> 00:07:35.009 
drivers test all this monza race either

00:07:35.009 --> 00:07:38.300 
drivers test all this monza race either
and<00:07:36.139> the<00:07:37.139> other<00:07:37.289> little<00:07:37.620> things<00:07:37.830> where<00:07:38.069> you

00:07:38.300 --> 00:07:38.310 
and the other little things where you

00:07:38.310 --> 00:07:39.710 
and the other little things where you
can't<00:07:38.580> change<00:07:38.789> from<00:07:39.060> car<00:07:39.270> to<00:07:39.300> car<00:07:39.449> and<00:07:39.659> the

00:07:39.710 --> 00:07:39.720 
can't change from car to car and the

00:07:39.720 --> 00:07:41.870 
can't change from car to car and the
replay<00:07:40.050> there's<00:07:40.680> like<00:07:40.889> an<00:07:41.009> upload<00:07:41.310> to<00:07:41.460> YouTube

00:07:41.870 --> 00:07:41.880 
replay there's like an upload to YouTube

00:07:41.880 --> 00:07:44.180 
replay there's like an upload to YouTube
button<00:07:42.120> in<00:07:42.419> the<00:07:42.509> replay<00:07:42.780> section<00:07:43.289> that<00:07:43.949> sort

button in the replay section that sort

00:07:44.190 --> 00:07:46.219 
button in the replay section that sort
of<00:07:44.220> stuff<00:07:44.460> makes<00:07:44.789> me<00:07:44.970> think<00:07:45.270> that<00:07:45.419> it<00:07:45.900> isn't

00:07:46.219 --> 00:07:46.229 
of stuff makes me think that it isn't

00:07:46.229 --> 00:07:48.140 
of stuff makes me think that it isn't
really<00:07:46.440> a<00:07:46.470> polished<00:07:46.889> game<00:07:47.159> but<00:07:47.880> this<00:07:47.970> is<00:07:48.120> just

00:07:48.140 --> 00:07:48.150 
really a polished game but this is just

00:07:48.150 --> 00:07:49.999 
really a polished game but this is just
the<00:07:48.419> first<00:07:48.599> impressions<00:07:49.139> obviously<00:07:49.530> guys<00:07:49.710> and

00:07:49.999 --> 00:07:50.009 
the first impressions obviously guys and

00:07:50.009 --> 00:07:51.950 
the first impressions obviously guys and
it's<00:07:50.610> obviously<00:07:50.909> only<00:07:51.210> the<00:07:51.330> demo<00:07:51.630> so<00:07:51.810> we're

00:07:51.950 --> 00:07:51.960 
it's obviously only the demo so we're

00:07:51.960 --> 00:07:53.390 
it's obviously only the demo so we're
not<00:07:52.080> sure<00:07:52.289> what's<00:07:52.680> gonna<00:07:52.800> actually<00:07:52.979> be<00:07:53.159> in<00:07:53.310> the

00:07:53.390 --> 00:07:53.400 
not sure what's gonna actually be in the

00:07:53.400 --> 00:07:56.180 
not sure what's gonna actually be in the
full<00:07:53.580> game<00:07:53.789> but<00:07:54.659> guys<00:07:55.440> that<00:07:55.469> is<00:07:55.860> pretty<00:07:56.039> much

00:07:56.180 --> 00:07:56.190 
full game but guys that is pretty much
