00:04:32.060 --> 00:04:32.070 
which is what happened but I'm probably

00:04:48.040 --> 00:04:48.050 

00:04:48.050 --> 00:04:50.900 

but<00:04:49.050> the<00:04:49.380> route<00:04:49.680> but<00:04:50.100> how<00:04:50.250> the<00:04:50.310> missus<00:04:50.730> act

00:04:50.900 --> 00:04:50.910

00:05:01.269 --> 00:05:01.279 
you really stick to the targets which

00:05:01.279 --> 00:05:03.309 
you really stick to the targets which
are<00:05:01.399> on<00:05:01.669> hand<00:05:01.879> makes<00:05:02.269> it<00:05:02.419> easy<00:05:02.569> to<00:05:02.689> move<00:05:03.049> down

00:05:03.309 --> 00:05:03.319
