here<00:01:19.560> it<00:01:20.069> would<00:01:20.189> be<00:01:20.310> a<00:01:20.340> middle<00:01:20.759> finger

00:01:20.830 --> 00:01:20.840 
here it would be a middle finger

00:01:20.840 --> 00:01:23.809 
here it would be a middle finger
activation<00:01:21.840> okay<00:01:22.560> you'll<00:01:23.100> notice<00:01:23.340> also<00:01:23.639> that

00:01:23.809 --> 00:01:23.819 
activation okay you'll notice also that

00:01:23.819 --> 00:01:25.910 
activation okay you'll notice also that
the<00:01:24.090> slide<00:01:24.359> will<00:01:24.569> still<00:01:24.810> go<00:01:25.380> back<00:01:25.560> and<00:01:25.770> forth

00:01:25.910 --> 00:01:25.920 
the slide will still go back and forth

00:01:25.920 --> 00:01:28.730 
the slide will still go back and forth
operate<00:01:26.369> independently<00:01:27.029> of<00:01:27.329> that<00:01:27.600> slide<00:01:28.049> or

00:01:28.730 --> 00:01:28.740 
operate independently of that slide or

00:01:28.740 --> 00:01:32.899 
operate independently of that slide or
off<00:01:29.369> of<00:01:29.579> that<00:01:29.869> that<00:01:30.869> grip<00:01:31.200> okay<00:01:32.069> so<00:01:32.549> if<00:01:32.639> I<00:01:32.729> need

00:01:35.149 --> 00:01:35.159 
to aim anything what I'm what I can do

00:01:35.159 --> 00:01:37.699 
to aim anything what I'm what I can do
here<00:01:35.490> is<00:01:35.579> I<00:01:35.700> can<00:01:35.849> just<00:01:35.999> push<00:01:36.359> push<00:01:37.200> my<00:01:37.380> little

00:01:37.699 --> 00:01:37.709 
here is I can just push push my little

00:01:37.709 --> 00:01:39.859 
here is I can just push push my little
button<00:01:38.039> here<00:01:38.069> and<00:01:38.369> I'm<00:01:38.729> aiming<00:01:39.179> straight<00:01:39.329> in

00:01:39.859 --> 00:01:39.869 
button here and I'm aiming straight in

00:01:39.869 --> 00:01:41.839 
button here and I'm aiming straight in
now<00:01:40.469> you'll<00:01:40.679> notice<00:01:40.889> that<00:01:41.099> there's<00:01:41.520> maybe

00:01:41.839 --> 00:01:41.849 
now you'll notice that there's maybe

00:01:41.849 --> 00:01:45.319 
now you'll notice that there's maybe
just<00:01:42.679> slight<00:01:43.679> difference<00:01:44.399> here<00:01:44.700> and<00:01:44.880> that's

00:01:45.319 --> 00:01:45.329 
just slight difference here and that's

00:01:45.329 --> 00:01:47.719 
just slight difference here and that's
because<00:01:45.689> we're<00:01:45.899> less<00:01:46.709> than<00:01:46.740> a<00:01:46.979> foot<00:01:47.490> from<00:01:47.520> the

00:01:47.719 --> 00:01:47.729 
because we're less than a foot from the

00:01:47.729 --> 00:01:50.449 
because we're less than a foot from the
target<00:01:48.240> but<00:01:48.990> not<00:01:49.049> and<00:01:49.499> it's<00:01:49.679> in<00:01:49.859> it's<00:01:50.009> again

00:01:50.449 --> 00:01:50.459 
target but not and it's in it's again

00:01:50.459 --> 00:01:53.059 
target but not and it's in it's again
it's<00:01:50.490> off<00:01:50.969> just<00:01:51.479> slightly<00:01:51.929> but<00:01:52.649> it's<00:01:52.889> not

00:01:53.059 --> 00:01:53.069 
it's off just slightly but it's not

00:01:53.069 --> 00:01:54.279 
it's off just slightly but it's not
going<00:01:53.249> to<00:01:53.340> make<00:01:53.429> that<00:01:53.490> big<00:01:53.880> of<00:01:53.909> a<00:01:54.090> difference

00:01:54.279 --> 00:01:54.289 
going to make that big of a difference

00:01:54.289 --> 00:01:57.019 
going to make that big of a difference
one<00:01:55.289> of<00:01:55.409> the<00:01:55.469> nice<00:01:55.740> one<00:01:56.219> of<00:01:56.310> the<00:01:56.399> advantages<00:01:56.729> of

00:01:57.019 --> 00:01:57.029 
one of the nice one of the advantages of

00:01:57.029 --> 00:02:00.139 
one of the nice one of the advantages of
having<00:01:57.479> a<00:01:58.020> laser<00:01:58.259> is<00:01:58.590> well<00:01:59.520> it<00:01:59.759> adds<00:01:59.999> an

00:02:00.139 --> 00:02:00.149 
having a laser is well it adds an

00:02:00.149 --> 00:02:01.969 
having a laser is well it adds an
intimidation<00:02:00.689> factor<00:02:00.719> if<00:02:01.349> somebody<00:02:01.739> sees

00:02:01.969 --> 00:02:01.979 
intimidation factor if somebody sees

00:02:01.979 --> 00:02:05.169 
intimidation factor if somebody sees
that<00:02:02.189> light<00:02:02.520> up<00:02:02.669> on<00:02:02.819> their<00:02:02.999> chest<00:02:03.299> okay<00:02:04.289> but

00:02:05.169 --> 00:02:05.179 
that light up on their chest okay but

00:02:05.179 --> 00:02:07.630 
that light up on their chest okay but
unfortunately<00:02:06.179> a<00:02:06.209> laser<00:02:06.599> can<00:02:06.869> give<00:02:07.109> you<00:02:07.229> away

00:02:07.630 --> 00:02:07.640 
unfortunately a laser can give you away

it's<00:03:15.390> vitally<00:03:16.050> important<00:03:16.500> that<00:03:16.590> you<00:03:17.250> learn

00:03:19.640 --> 00:03:19.650 
how to shoot off the site's first if you

00:03:19.650 --> 00:03:22.280 
how to shoot off the site's first if you
learn<00:03:20.070> off<00:03:20.250> how<00:03:20.580> to<00:03:20.610> shoot<00:03:20.940> off<00:03:21.090> a<00:03:21.120> laser<00:03:21.780> then

00:03:22.280 --> 00:03:22.290 
learn off how to shoot off a laser then

00:03:22.290 --> 00:03:24.020 
learn off how to shoot off a laser then
you're<00:03:22.470> always<00:03:22.800> going<00:03:23.190> to<00:03:23.250> be<00:03:23.370> looking<00:03:23.820> for

you're always going to be looking for

you're always going to be looking for
that<00:03:24.060> laser<00:03:24.450> and<00:03:24.750> then<00:03:24.780> trying<00:03:25.080> to<00:03:25.200> shoot<00:03:25.470> and

00:03:25.730 --> 00:03:25.740 
that laser and then trying to shoot and

00:03:25.740 --> 00:03:27.530 
that laser and then trying to shoot and
sometimes<00:03:26.400> it<00:03:26.550> might<00:03:26.640> be<00:03:26.790> difficult<00:03:27.000> to<00:03:27.360> pick

00:03:27.530 --> 00:03:27.540
