I'm<00:01:45.210> going<00:01:45.720> to<00:01:45.840> cut<00:01:46.079> further<00:01:47.630> down<00:01:49.070> how<00:01:50.070> about

00:01:50.569 --> 00:01:50.579 
I'm going to cut further down how about

00:01:50.579 --> 00:01:56.420 
I'm going to cut further down how about
right<00:01:51.210> here<00:01:51.979> so<00:01:54.710> I'm<00:01:55.710> just<00:01:55.979> going<00:01:56.159> to<00:01:56.219> start

00:01:56.420 --> 00:01:56.430 
right here so I'm just going to start

00:01:56.430 --> 00:01:58.760 
right here so I'm just going to start
from<00:01:56.640> that<00:01:56.700> top<00:01:57.420> height<00:01:57.780> we<00:01:58.140> get<00:01:58.320> out<00:01:58.469> first

00:01:58.760 --> 00:01:58.770 
from that top height we get out first

00:01:58.770 --> 00:02:01.459 
from that top height we get out first
and<00:01:59.430> I'm<00:01:59.729> going<00:01:59.939> to<00:02:00.030> follow<00:02:00.270> that<00:02:00.780> I'm<00:02:01.229> going

00:02:01.459 --> 00:02:01.469 
and I'm going to follow that I'm going

00:02:01.469 --> 00:02:13.740 
and I'm going to follow that I'm going
to<00:02:01.500> start<00:02:01.740> bringing<00:02:02.189> it<00:02:02.310> more<00:02:03.290> down<00:02:04.850> into<00:02:05.850> it

00:02:13.740 --> 00:02:13.750 

00:02:13.750 --> 00:02:22.540 

so<00:02:14.750> it<00:02:14.930> looks<00:02:15.170> more<00:02:18.250> long<00:02:19.250> yes<00:02:20.860> and<00:02:21.860> since

00:02:22.540 --> 00:02:22.550 
so it looks more long yes and since

00:02:22.550 --> 00:02:24.790 
so it looks more long yes and since
we've<00:02:22.790> a<00:02:22.940> lot<00:02:23.090> we<00:02:23.780> do<00:02:24.020> want<00:02:24.230> to<00:02:24.320> nice<00:02:24.590> the

00:02:24.790 --> 00:02:24.800 
we've a lot we do want to nice the

00:02:24.800 --> 00:02:30.660 
we've a lot we do want to nice the
sleeves<00:02:25.160> a<00:02:25.610> little<00:02:25.640> smaller<00:02:26.240> so<00:02:28.150> myself

00:02:30.660 --> 00:02:30.670 
sleeves a little smaller so myself

00:02:30.670 --> 00:02:50.850 
sleeves a little smaller so myself
same<00:02:31.670> with<00:02:31.880> this<00:02:32.060> side<00:02:32.120> repeat<00:02:33.110> that<00:02:33.290> process

00:02:50.850 --> 00:02:50.860 

00:02:50.860 --> 00:02:54.600 

so<00:02:51.860> it<00:02:52.130> does<00:02:52.400> still<00:02:52.910> look<00:02:52.940> a<00:02:53.209> little<00:02:53.600> weird

00:02:54.600 --> 00:02:54.610 
so it does still look a little weird

00:02:54.610 --> 00:02:59.830 
so it does still look a little weird
