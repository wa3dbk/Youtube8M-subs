you stopped maintaining them so tight if
they're<00:02:23.450> really<00:02:23.629> short<00:02:23.989> and<00:02:24.260> standing<00:02:24.650> up

they're really short and standing up

00:02:24.769 --> 00:02:27.699 
they're really short and standing up
then<00:02:25.099> they'll<00:02:25.459> lay<00:02:25.909> down<00:02:26.239> once<00:02:26.810> some<00:02:27.230> the<00:02:27.500> root

00:02:27.699 --> 00:02:27.709 
then they'll lay down once some the root

00:02:27.709 --> 00:02:29.979 
then they'll lay down once some the root
grows<00:02:28.010> out<00:02:28.220> a<00:02:28.250> bit<00:02:28.519> soft<00:02:29.000> and<00:02:29.360> they<00:02:29.540> gain<00:02:29.750> a<00:02:29.780> bit

00:02:29.979 --> 00:02:29.989 
grows out a bit soft and they gain a bit

00:02:29.989 --> 00:02:32.020 
grows out a bit soft and they gain a bit
of<00:02:30.049> length<00:02:30.410> if<00:02:30.739> they're<00:02:30.920> really<00:02:31.160> sure<00:02:31.549> then

00:02:32.020 --> 00:02:32.030 
of length if they're really sure then

00:02:32.030 --> 00:02:34.300 
of length if they're really sure then
you<00:02:32.180> can<00:02:32.360> find<00:02:32.599> that<00:02:32.870> the<00:02:33.200> structure<00:02:34.190> of<00:02:34.220> the

00:02:34.300 --> 00:02:34.310 
you can find that the structure of the

00:02:34.310 --> 00:02:36.250 
you can find that the structure of the
dreadlock<00:02:34.790> is<00:02:35.060> enough<00:02:35.390> to<00:02:35.660> hold<00:02:35.930> them<00:02:36.140> up

00:02:36.250 --> 00:02:36.260 
dreadlock is enough to hold them up

00:02:36.260 --> 00:02:37.780 
dreadlock is enough to hold them up
because<00:02:36.379> the<00:02:36.650> weight<00:02:36.799> of<00:02:36.980> them<00:02:37.310> isn't<00:02:37.489> enough

00:02:37.780 --> 00:02:37.790 
because the weight of them isn't enough

00:02:37.790 --> 00:02:41.100 
because the weight of them isn't enough
to<00:02:37.910> pull<00:02:38.060> them<00:02:38.209> down<00:02:38.239> advice<00:02:39.049> wear<00:02:39.950> a<00:02:39.980> hat

00:03:16.059 --> 00:03:16.069 
dreadlocks that are causing the dandruff

00:03:17.710 --> 00:03:17.720 
the people that have dandruff with

00:03:17.720 --> 00:03:19.300 
the people that have dandruff with
dreadlocks<00:03:17.959> would<00:03:18.349> have<00:03:18.560> dandruff<00:03:19.099> where

00:03:19.300 --> 00:03:19.310 
dreadlocks would have dandruff where

00:03:19.310 --> 00:03:21.099 
dreadlocks would have dandruff where
they<00:03:19.459> had<00:03:19.669> dreadlocks<00:03:19.940> or<00:03:20.329> not<00:03:20.690> it's<00:03:20.959> just

00:03:21.099 --> 00:03:21.109 
they had dreadlocks or not it's just

00:03:21.109 --> 00:03:22.900 
they had dreadlocks or not it's just
that<00:03:21.380> when<00:03:21.530> you<00:03:21.680> have<00:03:21.919> dreadlocks<00:03:22.310> you<00:03:22.669> can't

00:03:22.900 --> 00:03:22.910 
that when you have dreadlocks you can't

00:03:22.910 --> 00:03:25.150 
that when you have dreadlocks you can't
really<00:03:23.120> use<00:03:23.480> the<00:03:23.810> shampoos<00:03:24.590> that<00:03:24.620> are

00:03:25.150 --> 00:03:25.160 
really use the shampoos that are

00:03:25.160 --> 00:03:27.069 
really use the shampoos that are
designed<00:03:25.400> for<00:03:25.730> reducing<00:03:26.540> the<00:03:26.630> symptoms<00:03:26.750> of

00:03:27.069 --> 00:03:27.079 
designed for reducing the symptoms of

00:03:27.079 --> 00:03:29.110 
designed for reducing the symptoms of
dandruff<00:03:27.410> so<00:03:27.680> it<00:03:27.950> becomes<00:03:28.310> more<00:03:28.549> apparent<00:03:28.669> I

00:03:29.110 --> 00:03:29.120 
dandruff so it becomes more apparent I

00:03:29.120 --> 00:03:31.120 
dandruff so it becomes more apparent I
would<00:03:29.599> not<00:03:29.780> think<00:03:30.139> that<00:03:30.230> the<00:03:30.410> dandruff<00:03:30.799> itself

00:03:31.120 --> 00:03:31.130 
would not think that the dandruff itself

00:03:31.130 --> 00:03:32.440 
would not think that the dandruff itself
is<00:03:31.280> going<00:03:31.430> to<00:03:31.489> really<00:03:31.700> make<00:03:31.880> a<00:03:31.910> whole<00:03:32.209> big

00:03:32.440 --> 00:03:32.450 
is going to really make a whole big

00:03:32.450 --> 00:03:34.690 
is going to really make a whole big
difference<00:03:32.870> towards<00:03:33.349> the<00:03:33.950> locking<00:03:34.280> process

00:03:34.690 --> 00:03:34.700 
difference towards the locking process

00:03:34.700 --> 00:03:37.030 
difference towards the locking process
because<00:03:35.030> it's<00:03:35.209> just<00:03:35.450> you<00:03:35.660> know<00:03:35.750> it's<00:03:36.290> a<00:03:36.470> scalp

00:03:37.030 --> 00:03:37.040 
because it's just you know it's a scalp

00:03:37.040 --> 00:03:39.099 
because it's just you know it's a scalp
skin<00:03:37.489> that's<00:03:37.790> flaked<00:03:38.269> off<00:03:38.480> I<00:03:38.660> mean<00:03:38.810> everyone

has<00:03:39.260> it<00:03:39.410> to<00:03:39.500> some<00:03:39.650> degree<00:03:39.799> there<00:03:40.310> are<00:03:40.459> things

00:03:40.750 --> 00:03:40.760 
has it to some degree there are things
