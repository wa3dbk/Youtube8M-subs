00:00:24.259 --> 00:00:24.269 
post-process volume now we're going to

00:00:24.269 --> 00:00:25.880 
post-process volume now we're going to
go<00:00:24.359> inside<00:00:24.600> this<00:00:24.779> post-process<00:00:25.529> volume

00:00:25.880 --> 00:00:25.890 
go inside this post-process volume

00:00:25.890 --> 00:00:29.720

00:00:35.930 --> 00:00:45.910 
going to do is we're going to add a
fringe<00:00:36.930> intensity

00:00:45.910 --> 00:00:45.920 

00:00:45.920 --> 00:00:55.340 

we're<00:00:46.489> going<00:00:46.640> to<00:00:46.730> add<00:00:46.850> a<00:00:46.880> color<00:00:48.760> like<00:00:49.760> this

00:00:59.550 --> 00:01:03.470 
look like this now we're going to turn
that<00:00:59.730> fringe<00:01:00.000> intensity<00:01:00.600> down<00:01:00.780> just<00:01:02.270> right<00:01:03.270> to

00:01:03.470 --> 00:01:03.480 
that fringe intensity down just right to

00:01:03.480 --> 00:01:12.859 
that fringe intensity down just right to
there<00:01:06.680> and<00:01:09.979> go<00:01:10.979> back<00:01:11.220> and<00:01:11.460> deck<00:01:11.850> in<00:01:12.540> a<00:01:12.660> great

00:04:03.370 --> 00:04:03.380 
post-process volume ah - you're

00:04:03.380 --> 00:04:05.979 
post-process volume ah - you're
underwater<00:04:03.830> and<00:04:04.269> don't<00:04:05.269> forget<00:04:05.599> to<00:04:05.810> stretch
