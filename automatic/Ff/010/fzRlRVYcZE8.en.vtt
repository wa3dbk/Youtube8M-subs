00:01:02.009 --> 00:01:02.019 
in this particular one it's got quite

00:01:02.019 --> 00:01:04.350 
in this particular one it's got quite
tricky<00:01:02.350> box<00:01:02.769> as<00:01:02.920> well<00:01:03.100> with<00:01:03.309> the<00:01:03.460> with<00:01:04.239> the

paddle<00:01:04.659> shifts<00:01:05.080> but<00:01:05.890> that<00:01:06.009> adds<00:01:06.190> another

00:01:06.300 --> 00:01:06.310 
paddle shifts but that adds another

00:01:06.310 --> 00:01:08.820 
paddle shifts but that adds another
thousand<00:01:06.940> pounds<00:01:07.149> to<00:01:07.180> the<00:01:07.299> price<00:01:07.539> to<00:01:08.500> a<00:01:08.530> price

00:01:08.820 --> 00:01:08.830 
thousand pounds to the price to a price

00:01:08.830 --> 00:01:10.710 
thousand pounds to the price to a price
that's<00:01:09.009> already<00:01:09.430> three<00:01:10.000> thousand<00:01:10.390> more<00:01:10.539> than

00:01:10.710 --> 00:01:10.720 
that's already three thousand more than

00:01:10.720 --> 00:01:14.100 
that's already three thousand more than
the<00:01:10.840> Impreza<00:01:12.179> so<00:01:13.179> this<00:01:13.690> thing's<00:01:13.899> going<00:01:14.020> to

00:01:14.100 --> 00:01:14.110 
the Impreza so this thing's going to

00:01:14.110 --> 00:01:15.480 
the Impreza so this thing's going to
have<00:01:14.200> to<00:01:14.259> do<00:01:14.380> some<00:01:14.590> work<00:01:14.770> to<00:01:14.920> hold<00:01:15.039> off<00:01:15.220> the<00:01:15.250> new

00:01:15.490 --> 00:01:20.190 
have to do some work to hold off the new
STI<00:01:17.100> very<00:01:18.100> simple<00:01:18.700> matter<00:01:19.060> of<00:01:19.420> going<00:01:19.690> from<00:01:19.869> not

00:01:20.190 --> 00:01:20.200 
STI very simple matter of going from not

00:01:20.200 --> 00:01:22.020 
STI very simple matter of going from not
200<00:01:20.649> miles<00:01:20.770> an<00:01:20.890> hour<00:01:20.950> as<00:01:21.190> fast<00:01:21.550> as<00:01:21.700> possible

00:01:22.020 --> 00:01:22.030 
200 miles an hour as fast as possible

however<00:01:22.869> in<00:01:23.170> this<00:01:23.289> car<00:01:23.530> it's<00:01:23.740> not<00:01:23.950> that<00:01:24.130> simple

00:01:24.389 --> 00:01:24.399 
however in this car it's not that simple

00:01:24.399 --> 00:01:25.800 
however in this car it's not that simple
because<00:01:24.610> they're<00:01:24.789> about<00:01:24.970> a<00:01:25.000> million<00:01:25.360> governs

00:02:29.370 --> 00:02:33.320 

I<00:02:29.690> think<00:02:30.690> this<00:02:30.840> is<00:02:31.580> one<00:02:32.580> and<00:02:32.730> a<00:02:32.760> half<00:02:32.790> two

00:02:33.320 --> 00:02:33.330 
I think this is one and a half two

00:02:33.330 --> 00:02:35.119 
I think this is one and a half two
seconds<00:02:33.780> maybe<00:02:33.959> three<00:02:34.379> seconds<00:02:34.739> quicker<00:02:34.950> than

00:02:35.119 --> 00:02:35.129 
seconds maybe three seconds quicker than

00:02:35.129 --> 00:02:36.710 
seconds maybe three seconds quicker than
Evo<00:02:35.459> that's<00:02:35.670> a<00:02:35.760> huge<00:02:36.030> difference

00:02:36.710 --> 00:02:36.720 
Evo that's a huge difference

00:02:36.720 --> 00:02:38.330 
Evo that's a huge difference
okay<00:02:37.200> now<00:02:37.319> that<00:02:37.379> I've<00:02:37.530> done<00:02:37.650> my<00:02:37.709> best<00:02:37.980> to<00:02:38.099> break

00:02:38.330 --> 00:02:38.340 
okay now that I've done my best to break

okay now that I've done my best to break
both<00:02:38.580> cars<00:02:38.879> let's<00:02:39.180> see<00:02:39.300> how<00:02:39.360> fast<00:02:39.540> they

00:02:39.710 --> 00:02:39.720 
both cars let's see how fast they

00:02:39.720 --> 00:02:43.580 
both cars let's see how fast they

00:02:43.590 --> 00:02:45.949 
actually went Matt looking at the data
here<00:02:43.980> it<00:02:44.910> looks<00:02:45.060> as<00:02:45.180> if<00:02:45.300> they're<00:02:45.510> Subarus

00:02:45.949 --> 00:02:45.959 
here it looks as if they're Subarus

00:02:45.959 --> 00:02:49.339 
here it looks as if they're Subarus
considerably<00:02:46.890> faster<00:02:47.129> is<00:02:47.459> it<00:02:47.610> five<00:02:48.349> seconds

00:02:49.339 --> 00:02:49.349 
considerably faster is it five seconds

00:02:49.349 --> 00:02:55.059 
considerably faster is it five seconds
to<00:02:51.290> twelve<00:02:52.290> point<00:02:52.530> five<00:02:52.799> seconds<00:02:53.280> for<00:02:53.459> 200
