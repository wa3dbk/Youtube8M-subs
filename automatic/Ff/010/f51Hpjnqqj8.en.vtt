00:00:29.019 --> 00:00:29.029 
is what struck masters did it one time

00:00:29.029 --> 00:00:31.390 
is what struck masters did it one time
they<00:00:29.210> used<00:00:29.390> to<00:00:29.510> sell<00:00:29.720> a<00:00:29.750> coilover<00:00:30.349> setup<00:00:30.860> but

00:00:31.390 --> 00:00:31.400 
they used to sell a coilover setup but

00:00:31.400 --> 00:00:32.860 
they used to sell a coilover setup but
they<00:00:31.520> couldn't<00:00:31.850> get<00:00:31.970> the<00:00:32.090> spring<00:00:32.390> ratios

00:00:32.860 --> 00:00:32.870 
they couldn't get the spring ratios

00:00:32.870 --> 00:00:34.630 
they couldn't get the spring ratios
right<00:00:33.170> it<00:00:33.290> was<00:00:33.410> just<00:00:33.500> a<00:00:33.650> real<00:00:33.920> pain<00:00:34.250> to<00:00:34.460> deal

00:00:34.630 --> 00:00:34.640 
right it was just a real pain to deal

00:00:34.640 --> 00:00:36.549 
right it was just a real pain to deal
with<00:00:34.670> because<00:00:34.940> of<00:00:35.090> the<00:00:35.239> weight<00:00:35.449> of<00:00:35.480> the<00:00:35.660> car<00:00:35.930> so

00:00:36.549 --> 00:00:36.559 
with because of the weight of the car so

00:00:36.559 --> 00:00:38.200 
with because of the weight of the car so
they've<00:00:36.710> since<00:00:37.010> figured<00:00:37.430> out<00:00:37.550> what<00:00:37.820> Springs

00:00:38.200 --> 00:00:38.210 
they've since figured out what Springs

00:00:38.210 --> 00:00:39.520 
they've since figured out what Springs
they<00:00:38.330> need<00:00:38.540> to<00:00:38.660> do<00:00:38.780> the<00:00:38.900> back<00:00:39.140> because<00:00:39.379> this

00:00:39.520 --> 00:00:39.530 
they need to do the back because this

00:00:39.530 --> 00:00:41.439 
they need to do the back because this
car<00:00:39.739> is<00:00:39.949> independent<00:00:40.550> rear<00:00:40.670> suspension<00:00:40.699> and

00:00:41.439 --> 00:00:41.449 
car is independent rear suspension and

00:00:41.449 --> 00:00:43.689 
car is independent rear suspension and
it's<00:00:41.989> real<00:00:42.379> simple<00:00:42.860> it's<00:00:42.949> a<00:00:43.100> matter<00:00:43.309> of<00:00:43.400> taking

00:00:43.689 --> 00:00:43.699 
it's real simple it's a matter of taking

00:00:43.699 --> 00:00:46.180 
it's real simple it's a matter of taking
out<00:00:43.970> that<00:00:44.180> that<00:00:44.690> air<00:00:44.870> shock<00:00:45.170> putting<00:00:46.010> in<00:00:46.100> the

00:00:46.180 --> 00:00:46.190 
out that that air shock putting in the

00:00:46.190 --> 00:00:49.899 
out that that air shock putting in the
spring<00:00:46.580> and<00:00:47.050> replacing<00:00:48.050> the<00:00:48.140> shock<00:00:48.460> so<00:00:49.460> we're

00:00:49.899 --> 00:00:49.909 
spring and replacing the shock so we're

00:00:49.909 --> 00:00:54.520 
spring and replacing the shock so we're
getting<00:00:50.059> to<00:00:50.239> it<00:00:52.839> already<00:00:53.839> loosened<00:00:54.229> up<00:00:54.350> my

00:00:54.520 --> 00:00:54.530 
getting to it already loosened up my

00:00:54.530 --> 00:00:56.740 
getting to it already loosened up my
lugs<00:00:54.799> so<00:00:55.159> I'm<00:00:55.879> gonna<00:00:55.970> just<00:00:56.120> pop<00:00:56.330> these<00:00:56.540> babies

00:00:56.740 --> 00:00:56.750 
lugs so I'm gonna just pop these babies

00:00:56.750 --> 00:01:07.990 
lugs so I'm gonna just pop these babies
off<00:01:05.140> we're<00:01:06.140> gonna<00:01:06.229> do<00:01:06.520> now<00:01:07.520> this<00:01:07.640> one's<00:01:07.909> a

00:01:09.229 --> 00:01:11.320 
little bit different we're gonna take
the<00:01:09.320> shock<00:01:09.619> absorber<00:01:10.100> out<00:01:10.250> first<00:01:10.670> disconnect

00:01:11.320 --> 00:01:11.330 
the shock absorber out first disconnect

00:01:11.330 --> 00:01:13.180 
the shock absorber out first disconnect
everything<00:01:11.720> for<00:01:11.900> that<00:01:11.930> that'll<00:01:12.650> allow<00:01:13.130> the

00:01:13.180 --> 00:01:13.190 
everything for that that'll allow the

00:01:13.190 --> 00:01:14.770 
everything for that that'll allow the
rear<00:01:13.700> suspension<00:01:13.850> had<00:01:14.330> dropped<00:01:14.540> down<00:01:14.720> a

00:01:14.770 --> 00:01:14.780 
rear suspension had dropped down a

00:01:14.780 --> 00:01:19.630 
rear suspension had dropped down a
little<00:01:15.049> bit<00:01:15.229> more<00:01:15.500> I<00:01:16.630> don't<00:01:17.630> see<00:01:18.320> oh<00:01:18.830> there<00:01:19.549> it

00:02:19.630 --> 00:02:22.840 

now<00:02:20.630> just<00:02:21.319> tension<00:02:21.740> on<00:02:21.860> this<00:02:22.010> nut<00:02:22.310> it's

00:02:22.840 --> 00:02:22.850 
now just tension on this nut it's

00:02:22.850 --> 00:02:24.820 
now just tension on this nut it's
getting<00:02:23.150> close<00:02:23.390> to<00:02:23.599> the<00:02:23.690> end<00:02:23.870> and<00:02:24.319> the<00:02:24.500> reason

00:02:24.820 --> 00:02:24.830 
getting close to the end and the reason

00:02:24.830 --> 00:02:26.470 
getting close to the end and the reason
why<00:02:24.950> it<00:02:25.010> is<00:02:25.099> tension<00:02:25.519> on<00:02:25.640> it<00:02:25.790> is<00:02:26.180> because<00:02:26.390> I

00:02:26.470 --> 00:02:26.480 
why it is tension on it is because I

00:02:26.480 --> 00:02:29.059 
why it is tension on it is because I
don't<00:02:26.750> have<00:02:26.930> the<00:02:27.080> jack<00:02:27.409> underneath<00:02:28.190> the<00:02:28.430> lower

00:02:29.059 --> 00:02:29.069 
don't have the jack underneath the lower

00:02:29.069 --> 00:02:31.039 
don't have the jack underneath the lower
the<00:02:29.640> independent<00:02:30.150> rear<00:02:30.269> suspension<00:02:30.299> so<00:02:31.019> you

00:02:31.039 --> 00:02:31.049 
the independent rear suspension so you

00:02:31.049 --> 00:02:32.899 
the independent rear suspension so you
guys<00:02:31.379> stay<00:02:31.620> there<00:02:31.950> I'm<00:02:32.250> gonna<00:02:32.430> put<00:02:32.519> the<00:02:32.700> jack

00:02:32.899 --> 00:02:32.909 
guys stay there I'm gonna put the jack

00:02:32.909 --> 00:02:43.520 
guys stay there I'm gonna put the jack
under<00:02:32.939> it<00:02:40.010> down<00:02:41.689> it<00:02:42.689> already<00:02:42.900> starts<00:02:43.260> to<00:02:43.349> come

00:02:43.520 --> 00:02:43.530 
under it down it already starts to come

00:02:43.530 --> 00:03:06.229 
under it down it already starts to come
out<00:03:02.810> this<00:03:03.810> is<00:03:03.959> the<00:03:04.049> air<00:03:04.230> line<00:03:04.849> this<00:03:05.849> is<00:03:06.030> the<00:03:06.090> air

00:03:06.229 --> 00:03:06.239 
out this is the air line this is the air

00:03:06.239 --> 00:03:08.149 
out this is the air line this is the air
line<00:03:06.480> of<00:03:06.629> put<00:03:06.780> air<00:03:07.019> in<00:03:07.139> that<00:03:07.260> shot<00:03:07.590> as<00:03:07.829> an<00:03:07.980> air

00:03:08.149 --> 00:03:08.159 
line of put air in that shot as an air

00:03:08.159 --> 00:03:09.800 
line of put air in that shot as an air
assistance<00:03:08.700> shock<00:03:08.970> that's<00:03:09.239> how<00:03:09.419> they<00:03:09.629> make

00:03:09.800 --> 00:03:09.810 
assistance shock that's how they make

00:03:09.810 --> 00:03:11.449 
assistance shock that's how they make
that's<00:03:10.079> how<00:03:10.200> they<00:03:10.349> manage<00:03:10.680> to<00:03:10.709> maintain<00:03:11.250> their

00:03:11.449 --> 00:03:11.459 
that's how they manage to maintain their

00:03:11.459 --> 00:03:14.479 
that's how they manage to maintain their
ride<00:03:11.669> quality<00:03:12.239> on<00:03:12.389> these<00:03:13.139> cars<00:03:13.470> that's<00:03:14.220> why

00:03:14.479 --> 00:03:14.489 
ride quality on these cars that's why

00:03:14.489 --> 00:03:18.170 
ride quality on these cars that's why
they<00:03:14.609> use<00:03:14.730> a<00:03:14.760> regular<00:03:15.030> spring<00:03:17.120> there's<00:03:18.120> a

00:03:18.170 --> 00:03:18.180 
they use a regular spring there's a

00:03:18.180 --> 00:03:28.640 
they use a regular spring there's a
sensor<00:03:18.659> here<00:03:19.970> your<00:03:20.970> switch<00:03:23.840> oh<00:03:27.590> there's<00:03:28.590> a

00:03:28.640 --> 00:03:28.650 
sensor here your switch oh there's a

00:03:28.650 --> 00:03:31.729 
sensor here your switch oh there's a
plug<00:03:28.919> back<00:03:29.159> there<00:03:30.079> now<00:03:31.079> back<00:03:31.319> there<00:03:31.560> by<00:03:31.680> it

00:03:31.729 --> 00:03:31.739 
plug back there now back there by it

00:03:31.739 --> 00:03:34.490 
plug back there now back there by it
with<00:03:32.069> a<00:03:32.099> control<00:03:32.579> arm<00:03:32.760> mounts<00:03:33.239> there's<00:03:34.049> a<00:03:34.139> plug

00:03:34.490 --> 00:03:34.500 
with a control arm mounts there's a plug

00:03:34.500 --> 00:03:36.319 
with a control arm mounts there's a plug
all<00:03:35.159> we're<00:03:35.430> gonna<00:03:35.519> do<00:03:35.760> is<00:03:35.879> we're<00:03:35.970> gonna<00:03:36.060> reach

00:03:36.319 --> 00:03:36.329 
all we're gonna do is we're gonna reach

00:03:36.329 --> 00:03:38.330 
all we're gonna do is we're gonna reach
up<00:03:36.510> in<00:03:36.659> there<00:03:36.840> disconnect<00:03:37.560> that<00:03:37.620> plug<00:03:38.040> and

00:03:38.330 --> 00:03:38.340 
up in there disconnect that plug and

00:03:38.340 --> 00:03:40.520 
up in there disconnect that plug and
then<00:03:38.699> we're<00:03:38.790> gonna<00:03:38.909> leave<00:03:39.120> it<00:03:39.269> alone<00:03:39.479> and<00:03:39.810> it's

00:03:40.520 --> 00:03:40.530 
then we're gonna leave it alone and it's

00:03:40.530 --> 00:03:42.559 
then we're gonna leave it alone and it's
this<00:03:41.190> is<00:03:41.250> done<00:03:41.639> I<00:03:41.819> mean<00:03:42.030> it's<00:03:42.150> essentially

00:03:42.559 --> 00:03:42.569 
this is done I mean it's essentially

00:03:42.569 --> 00:03:48.530 
this is done I mean it's essentially
comes<00:03:42.930> out<00:03:45.260> all<00:03:46.260> right<00:03:46.409> now<00:03:47.180> that<00:03:48.180> came<00:03:48.359> out

00:03:48.530 --> 00:03:48.540 
comes out all right now that came out

00:03:48.540 --> 00:03:56.569 
comes out all right now that came out
real<00:03:48.900> easy<00:03:55.010> here's<00:03:56.010> what<00:03:56.129> I<00:03:56.159> was<00:03:56.280> talking

00:03:56.569 --> 00:03:56.579 
real easy here's what I was talking

00:03:56.579 --> 00:03:58.729 
real easy here's what I was talking
about<00:03:56.639> before<00:03:56.849> with<00:03:57.239> the<00:03:57.329> caps<00:03:57.569> or<00:03:57.780> not<00:03:57.930> see

00:03:58.729 --> 00:03:58.739 
about before with the caps or not see

00:03:58.739 --> 00:04:00.589 
about before with the caps or not see
how<00:03:58.859> it<00:03:59.010> wraps<00:03:59.220> around<00:03:59.519> and<00:03:59.970> goes<00:04:00.120> under<00:04:00.389> it

00:04:00.589 --> 00:04:00.599 
how it wraps around and goes under it

00:04:00.599 --> 00:04:02.569 
how it wraps around and goes under it
goes<00:04:00.930> all<00:04:01.139> the<00:04:01.169> way<00:04:01.260> around<00:04:01.470> that<00:04:02.190> way<00:04:02.370> when

00:04:02.569 --> 00:04:02.579 
goes all the way around that way when

00:04:02.579 --> 00:04:04.039 
goes all the way around that way when
you<00:04:02.669> take<00:04:02.879> it<00:04:03.060> off<00:04:03.120> and<00:04:03.239> put<00:04:03.569> it<00:04:03.599> on<00:04:03.750> it

00:04:04.039 --> 00:04:04.049 
you take it off and put it on it

00:04:04.049 --> 00:04:06.020 
you take it off and put it on it
actually<00:04:04.470> locks<00:04:04.680> against<00:04:05.190> itself<00:04:05.519> and<00:04:05.699> holds

00:04:06.020 --> 00:04:06.030 
actually locks against itself and holds

00:04:06.030 --> 00:04:15.409 
actually locks against itself and holds
it<00:04:06.150> but<00:04:06.569> we<00:04:06.690> won't<00:04:06.840> be<00:04:06.930> using<00:04:06.989> that<00:04:07.379> again<00:04:14.419> we

00:04:15.409 --> 00:04:15.419 
it but we won't be using that again we

00:04:15.419 --> 00:04:44.070 
it but we won't be using that again we
need

00:04:44.070 --> 00:04:44.080 

00:04:44.080 --> 00:04:51.610 

because<00:04:45.080> our<00:04:45.230> spring<00:04:50.139> now<00:04:51.139> these<00:04:51.320> rubber

00:04:51.610 --> 00:04:51.620 
because our spring now these rubber

00:04:51.620 --> 00:04:54.880 
because our spring now these rubber
isolators<00:04:52.460> is<00:04:52.669> what<00:04:53.480> they<00:04:53.660> do<00:04:53.720> is<00:04:54.169> they<00:04:54.560> keep

00:04:54.880 --> 00:04:54.890 
isolators is what they do is they keep

00:04:54.890 --> 00:04:57.250 
isolators is what they do is they keep
this<00:04:55.430> they<00:04:55.760> keep<00:04:55.970> the<00:04:56.150> spring<00:04:56.480> from<00:04:56.630> squeaking

00:04:57.250 --> 00:04:57.260 
this they keep the spring from squeaking

00:04:57.260 --> 00:04:59.110 
this they keep the spring from squeaking
if<00:04:57.410> you<00:04:57.860> have<00:04:58.010> bare<00:04:58.310> metal<00:04:58.550> on<00:04:58.820> bare<00:04:59.090> metal

00:04:59.110 --> 00:04:59.120 
if you have bare metal on bare metal

00:04:59.120 --> 00:05:01.810 
if you have bare metal on bare metal
you're<00:04:59.450> gonna<00:04:59.570> get<00:04:59.750> two<00:05:00.370> and<00:05:01.370> you<00:05:01.460> don't<00:05:01.640> want

00:05:01.810 --> 00:05:01.820 
you're gonna get two and you don't want

00:05:01.820 --> 00:05:03.820 
you're gonna get two and you don't want
that<00:05:02.030> so<00:05:02.630> what<00:05:02.780> they<00:05:02.930> do<00:05:02.990> is<00:05:03.290> they<00:05:03.470> put<00:05:03.710> these

00:05:03.820 --> 00:05:03.830 
that so what they do is they put these

00:05:03.830 --> 00:05:05.710 
that so what they do is they put these
rubber<00:05:04.070> Isolators<00:05:04.790> in<00:05:04.940> one<00:05:05.120> on<00:05:05.270> the<00:05:05.360> top<00:05:05.570> of

00:05:05.710 --> 00:05:05.720 
rubber Isolators in one on the top of

00:05:05.720 --> 00:05:07.000 
rubber Isolators in one on the top of
the<00:05:05.780> spring<00:05:05.990> and<00:05:06.200> one<00:05:06.290> on<00:05:06.410> the<00:05:06.500> bottom<00:05:06.710> of<00:05:06.950> the

00:05:07.000 --> 00:05:07.010 
the spring and one on the bottom of the

00:05:07.010 --> 00:05:09.370 
the spring and one on the bottom of the
spring<00:05:07.220> and<00:05:07.520> that<00:05:07.580> keeps<00:05:08.480> the<00:05:08.690> squeaking<00:05:09.050> down

00:05:09.370 --> 00:05:09.380 
spring and that keeps the squeaking down

00:05:09.380 --> 00:05:12.190 
spring and that keeps the squeaking down
not<00:05:10.040> only<00:05:10.280> that<00:05:10.490> on<00:05:10.760> this<00:05:11.030> car<00:05:11.390> because<00:05:11.990> it's

00:05:12.190 --> 00:05:12.200 
not only that on this car because it's

00:05:12.200 --> 00:05:14.350 
not only that on this car because it's
got<00:05:12.320> aluminum<00:05:12.560> lower<00:05:12.950> control<00:05:13.340> arms<00:05:13.729> if<00:05:13.880> you

00:05:14.350 --> 00:05:14.360 
got aluminum lower control arms if you

00:05:14.360 --> 00:05:16.690 
got aluminum lower control arms if you
had<00:05:14.570> the<00:05:14.750> steel<00:05:15.260> just<00:05:16.070> rubbing<00:05:16.550> on<00:05:16.669> that

00:05:16.690 --> 00:05:16.700 
had the steel just rubbing on that

00:05:16.700 --> 00:05:18.340 
had the steel just rubbing on that
control<00:05:17.300> arm<00:05:17.510> it's<00:05:17.690> gonna<00:05:17.780> wear<00:05:18.110> it<00:05:18.229> out

00:05:18.340 --> 00:05:18.350 
control arm it's gonna wear it out

00:05:18.350 --> 00:05:20.920 
control arm it's gonna wear it out
really<00:05:18.710> fast<00:05:19.070> but<00:05:20.000> we're<00:05:20.389> gonna<00:05:20.479> do<00:05:20.630> something

00:05:20.920 --> 00:05:20.930 
really fast but we're gonna do something

00:05:20.930 --> 00:05:31.170 
really fast but we're gonna do something
else<00:05:21.080> so<00:05:21.400> we<00:05:22.400> won't<00:05:22.580> need<00:05:22.729> those<00:05:22.940> Isolators

00:05:31.170 --> 00:05:31.180 

00:05:31.180 --> 00:05:36.040 

now<00:05:32.290> we<00:05:33.290> take<00:05:33.440> this<00:05:33.590> hockey<00:05:33.860> puck<00:05:34.750> so<00:05:35.750> it<00:05:35.900> looks

00:05:36.040 --> 00:05:36.050 
now we take this hockey puck so it looks

00:05:36.050 --> 00:05:39.310 
now we take this hockey puck so it looks
like<00:05:36.229> it's<00:05:37.100> not<00:05:37.220> really<00:05:37.990> take<00:05:38.990> our<00:05:39.110> hockey

00:05:39.310 --> 00:05:39.320 
like it's not really take our hockey

00:05:39.320 --> 00:05:42.909 
like it's not really take our hockey
puck<00:05:39.650> we<00:05:40.610> put<00:05:40.820> it<00:05:40.910> through<00:05:40.940> the<00:05:41.450> hole<00:05:41.770> do<00:05:42.770> the

00:05:42.909 --> 00:05:42.919 
puck we put it through the hole do the

00:05:42.919 --> 00:05:45.219 
puck we put it through the hole do the
hole<00:05:43.070> in<00:05:43.220> the<00:05:43.310> lower<00:05:43.460> control<00:05:43.880> arm<00:05:44.210> drop<00:05:45.020> our

00:05:45.219 --> 00:05:45.229 
hole in the lower control arm drop our

00:05:45.229 --> 00:05:47.670 
hole in the lower control arm drop our
hockey<00:05:45.410> puck<00:05:45.770> on<00:05:45.890> top

00:05:47.670 --> 00:05:47.680 
hockey puck on top

00:05:47.680 --> 00:05:55.320 
hockey puck on top
we<00:05:48.680> take<00:05:48.860> our<00:05:49.010> washers<00:05:53.080> flat<00:05:54.080> washer<00:05:54.620> lock

00:05:55.320 --> 00:05:55.330 
we take our washers flat washer lock

00:05:55.330 --> 00:06:03.179 
we take our washers flat washer lock
washer

00:06:03.179 --> 00:06:03.189 

00:06:03.189 --> 00:06:06.719 

now<00:06:03.759> we<00:06:03.819> tighten<00:06:04.270> it<00:06:04.330> all<00:06:04.449> up<00:06:05.309> the<00:06:06.309> reason<00:06:06.610> why

00:06:06.719 --> 00:06:06.729 
now we tighten it all up the reason why

00:06:06.729 --> 00:06:08.070 
now we tighten it all up the reason why
we<00:06:06.909> tighten<00:06:07.209> it<00:06:07.239> up<00:06:07.360> because<00:06:07.539> we<00:06:07.779> don't<00:06:07.929> want

00:06:08.070 --> 00:06:08.080 
we tighten it up because we don't want

00:06:08.080 --> 00:06:10.529 
we tighten it up because we don't want
it<00:06:08.169> to<00:06:08.259> move<00:06:08.439> because<00:06:09.249> this<00:06:09.489> piece<00:06:09.789> locates

00:06:10.529 --> 00:06:10.539 
it to move because this piece locates

00:06:10.539 --> 00:06:12.929 
it to move because this piece locates
the<00:06:10.869> bottom<00:06:11.199> of<00:06:11.319> the<00:06:11.379> spring<00:06:11.739> that's<00:06:12.729> what

00:06:12.929 --> 00:06:12.939 
the bottom of the spring that's what

00:06:12.939 --> 00:06:14.429 
the bottom of the spring that's what
keeps<00:06:13.119> the<00:06:13.300> spring<00:06:13.689> from<00:06:13.869> wallowing<00:06:14.229> around

00:06:14.429 --> 00:06:14.439 
keeps the spring from wallowing around

00:06:14.439 --> 00:06:17.189 
keeps the spring from wallowing around
and<00:06:14.949> flying<00:06:15.879> out<00:06:16.119> like<00:06:16.300> it's<00:06:16.449> not<00:06:16.599> supposed<00:06:17.050> to

00:06:17.189 --> 00:06:17.199 
and flying out like it's not supposed to

00:06:17.199 --> 00:06:18.509 
and flying out like it's not supposed to
and<00:06:17.439> doing<00:06:17.559> all<00:06:17.800> kinds<00:06:18.069> of<00:06:18.129> things<00:06:18.309> that<00:06:18.459> you

00:06:18.509 --> 00:06:18.519 
and doing all kinds of things that you

00:06:18.519 --> 00:06:29.070 
and doing all kinds of things that you
don't<00:06:18.699> want<00:06:18.879> it<00:06:18.969> to<00:06:19.059> do<00:06:19.589> then<00:06:23.099> what<00:06:24.099> we<00:06:24.189> do<00:06:28.080> now

00:06:29.070 --> 00:06:29.080 
don't want it to do then what we do now

00:06:29.080 --> 00:06:34.320 
don't want it to do then what we do now
we're<00:06:29.800> gonna<00:06:29.889> take<00:06:30.069> the<00:06:30.189> spring<00:06:31.649> as<00:06:32.649> always<00:06:33.429> on

00:06:34.320 --> 00:06:34.330 
we're gonna take the spring as always on

00:06:34.330 --> 00:06:36.779 
we're gonna take the spring as always on
this<00:06:34.659> on<00:06:34.899> this<00:06:35.110> particular<00:06:35.679> setup<00:06:35.949> the<00:06:36.459> spring

00:06:36.779 --> 00:06:36.789 
this on this particular setup the spring

00:06:36.789 --> 00:06:38.459 
this on this particular setup the spring
still<00:06:37.240> go<00:06:37.419> back<00:06:37.659> but<00:06:38.080> this<00:06:38.199> time<00:06:38.349> they're

00:06:38.459 --> 00:06:38.469 
still go back but this time they're

00:06:38.469 --> 00:06:40.619 
still go back but this time they're
gonna<00:06:38.559> be<00:06:38.649> upside<00:06:39.069> down<00:06:39.099> cuz<00:06:39.939> it<00:06:40.089> because<00:06:40.419> this

00:06:40.619 --> 00:06:40.629 
gonna be upside down cuz it because this

00:06:40.629 --> 00:06:43.679 
gonna be upside down cuz it because this
piece<00:06:40.899> this<00:06:41.409> opening<00:06:41.949> is<00:06:42.550> smaller<00:06:42.909> than<00:06:43.539> this

00:06:43.679 --> 00:06:43.689 
piece this opening is smaller than this

00:06:43.689 --> 00:06:46.139 
piece this opening is smaller than this
opening<00:06:44.169> and<00:06:44.559> this<00:06:44.740> end<00:06:45.009> just<00:06:45.249> won't<00:06:45.819> fit<00:06:45.939> over

00:06:46.139 --> 00:06:46.149 
opening and this end just won't fit over

00:06:46.149 --> 00:06:47.730 
opening and this end just won't fit over
the<00:06:46.240> hockey<00:06:46.419> puck<00:06:46.689> so<00:06:47.259> we're<00:06:47.349> gonna<00:06:47.439> put<00:06:47.589> this

00:06:47.730 --> 00:06:47.740 
the hockey puck so we're gonna put this

00:06:47.740 --> 00:06:50.399 
the hockey puck so we're gonna put this
on<00:06:47.919> top<00:06:47.979> our<00:06:48.459> rubber<00:06:48.669> isolator<00:06:49.229> had<00:06:50.229> to<00:06:50.319> go

00:06:50.399 --> 00:06:50.409 
on top our rubber isolator had to go

00:06:50.409 --> 00:06:52.499 
on top our rubber isolator had to go
back<00:06:50.559> and<00:06:50.769> look<00:06:50.830> at<00:06:50.979> the<00:06:51.039> instructions<00:06:51.669> I<00:06:51.849> said

00:06:52.499 --> 00:06:52.509 
back and look at the instructions I said

00:06:52.509 --> 00:06:54.359 
back and look at the instructions I said
the<00:06:52.629> wrong<00:06:52.779> thing<00:06:53.080> we<00:06:53.349> are<00:06:53.559> gonna<00:06:53.889> use<00:06:53.979> it<00:06:54.129> over

00:06:54.359 --> 00:06:54.369 
the wrong thing we are gonna use it over

00:06:54.369 --> 00:07:24.700 
the wrong thing we are gonna use it over
all<00:06:56.129> rubber<00:06:57.129> isolator<00:06:57.610> goes<00:06:57.849> in<00:06:59.159> position

00:07:24.700 --> 00:07:24.710 

00:07:24.710 --> 00:07:31.719
