00:00:04.210 --> 00:00:09.559
 after the 5 now receives the 3 series 

00:00:07.100 --> 00:00:12.139
 bmw series with a gran turismo 

00:00:09.559 --> 00:00:14.269
 a new family member of the 3er gt 

00:00:12.139 --> 00:00:16.309
 combines the sporty dynamic genes 

00:00:14.269 --> 00:00:18.260
 the sedan with the versatility of 

00:00:16.309 --> 00:00:20.750
 touring main difference 

00:00:18.260 --> 00:00:23.030
 However, the rear here is the gt 

00:00:20.750 --> 00:00:24.560
 with an extendable spoiler on in 

00:00:23.030 --> 00:00:25.100
 all dimensions is the car 

00:00:24.560 --> 00:00:27.560
 grown 

00:00:25.100 --> 00:00:32.550
 the eight centimeters more height let the 

00:00:27.560 --> 00:00:34.840
 driver and sit 6 cm higher 

00:00:32.550 --> 00:00:37.390
 Of course we have ours 

00:00:34.840 --> 00:00:39.100
 engineers very intense about the 

00:00:37.390 --> 00:00:41.260
 proportion spoken 

00:00:39.100 --> 00:00:42.760
 I think you can see this work, too 

00:00:41.260 --> 00:00:46.420
 about the proportion one sees this 

00:00:42.760 --> 00:00:48.940
 coupe-like silhouette and natural 

00:00:46.420 --> 00:00:52.300
 also over the width the height 

00:00:48.940 --> 00:00:54.629
 the length of 20 centimeters is the gt 

00:00:52.300 --> 00:00:58.769
 longer than the tour in the front row 

00:00:54.629 --> 00:00:58.769
 Touch the direction of the new direction 

00:00:59.760 --> 00:01:06.920
 in the side view shows the new 

00:01:01.679 --> 00:01:06.920
 sweeping the roof line as well as in mc 

00:01:08.040 --> 00:01:13.020
 We have two innovations here 

00:01:09.900 --> 00:01:15.510
 an elevated front and behind that 

00:01:13.020 --> 00:01:18.330
 front wheel an ergo theirs the two 

00:01:15.510 --> 00:01:23.010
 improve the aerodynamics by the 

00:01:18.330 --> 00:01:25.590
 turbulence in the wheel arch minimizes this 

00:01:23.010 --> 00:01:28.170
 works so that the pressure in the 

00:01:25.590 --> 00:01:30.540
 Radl on through this vent through 

00:01:28.170 --> 00:01:32.700
 reduced the ereader and thus one has 

00:01:30.540 --> 00:01:35.640
 a better aerodynamics and of course 

00:01:32.700 --> 00:01:38.820
 then less emissions and less 

00:01:35.640 --> 00:01:41.550
 use three petrol and two 

00:01:38.820 --> 00:01:44.300
 frugal diesel stand for the 3 gt 

00:01:41.550 --> 00:01:44.300
 for optional 

00:01:51.250 --> 00:01:56.770
 All engines are with the latest power 

00:01:53.800 --> 00:02:00.010
 turbo technology that is equipped 

00:01:56.770 --> 00:02:03.180
 the motors serve both the theme 

00:02:00.010 --> 00:02:06.370
 fun with fun as well as fun 

00:02:03.180 --> 00:02:07.810
 the theme consumption and the latest 

00:02:06.370 --> 00:02:10.539
 emission requirements we have here 

00:02:07.810 --> 00:02:13.240
 many technologies on board the 

00:02:10.539 --> 00:02:17.800
 Customers a very fuel-efficient front 

00:02:13.240 --> 00:02:20.290
 let's test the 3's as 320 d 

00:02:17.800 --> 00:02:24.480
 with 135 kw power and a maximum 

00:02:20.290 --> 00:02:26.980
 torque of 380 newton meters 

00:02:24.480 --> 00:02:29.140
 for the sprint from zero to 100 km h 

00:02:26.980 --> 00:02:31.870
 the cart needs 79 seconds 

00:02:29.140 --> 00:02:33.580
 it is only 0.2 seconds slower 

00:02:31.870 --> 00:02:36.610
 as the comparable combination and that 

00:02:33.580 --> 00:02:40.290
 despite 65 kilograms more weight and the 

00:02:36.610 --> 00:02:40.290
 slightly worse drag 

00:02:44.700 --> 00:02:48.310
 for the european market 

00:02:46.810 --> 00:02:51.519
 of course the diesel engines extremely 

00:02:48.310 --> 00:02:53.680
 important is a great deal of driving pleasure 

00:02:51.519 --> 00:02:55.989
 High torque offer high agility 

00:02:53.680 --> 00:02:58.930
 with very low consumption they take 

00:02:55.989 --> 00:03:00.819
 the model of the 320 d is sure that 

00:02:58.930 --> 00:03:03.190
 be what we sell the most 

00:03:00.819 --> 00:03:06.250
 There we have top speed 

00:03:03.190 --> 00:03:08.230
 230 km h very good performance at 

00:03:06.250 --> 00:03:11.890
 consumption of 4.9 liters per 100 

00:03:08.230 --> 00:03:15.099
 miles how come the design of the 

00:03:11.890 --> 00:03:17.109
 new gt we ask advise kay automobile 

00:03:15.099 --> 00:03:19.500
 Journalist from Australia after his 

00:03:17.109 --> 00:03:19.500
 first press 

00:03:23.880 --> 00:03:27.700
 we have here the third variant of the 

00:03:26.470 --> 00:03:30.460
 new 3 Series 

00:03:27.700 --> 00:03:33.580
 The car is sporty and at the same time 

00:03:30.460 --> 00:03:35.820
 practically a lot of space a sporty 

00:03:33.580 --> 00:03:35.820
 driving emotion 

00:03:37.050 --> 00:03:43.200
 our test model will be switched over 

00:03:39.610 --> 00:03:43.200
 an eight-speed automatic transmission 

00:03:45.720 --> 00:03:49.900
 bmw has a very spacious car 

00:03:48.070 --> 00:03:52.060
 managed three seats and the 

00:03:49.900 --> 00:03:54.250
 Sitting position are a bit higher than 

00:03:52.060 --> 00:03:58.170
 in the 3er sedan and turin and 

00:03:54.250 --> 00:03:58.170
 in the back you have a lot more 

00:04:00.930 --> 00:04:05.500
 seven centimeters to be exact that 

00:04:03.640 --> 00:04:07.990
 draws a gran turismo like the 3 Series 

00:04:05.500 --> 00:04:12.520
 gt also put on long distances 

00:04:07.990 --> 00:04:14.560
 that all passengers comfortably the 3er 

00:04:12.520 --> 00:04:16.810
 Kombi is traditionally very eager in 

00:04:14.560 --> 00:04:18.940
 europe but in other countries like 

00:04:16.810 --> 00:04:22.060
 This is not the case in America or China 

00:04:18.940 --> 00:04:24.010
 better by bmw the three a new tail 

00:04:22.060 --> 00:04:27.870
 given styling and on with it customers in 

00:04:24.010 --> 00:04:27.870
 the usa and to address here 

00:04:30.150 --> 00:04:35.050
 not only the design is changing it 

00:04:32.950 --> 00:04:36.550
 There are also new functions visible 

00:04:35.050 --> 00:04:38.380
 the luggage compartment in front of the curious 

00:04:36.550 --> 00:04:40.510
 Protecting oneself can be protected with few 

00:04:38.380 --> 00:04:43.540
 Handles stowed in the trunk floor 

00:04:40.510 --> 00:04:45.850
 that exceeds the normal configuration 

00:04:43.540 --> 00:04:48.220
 the gt the combo load volume by 40 

00:04:45.850 --> 00:04:50.320
 liter from the tail can be the 

00:04:48.220 --> 00:04:51.940
 conveniently unlock the rear seat 

00:04:50.320 --> 00:04:54.520
 increase cargo space accordingly 

00:04:51.940 --> 00:04:58.080
 Practical arguments certainly in 

00:04:54.520 --> 00:04:58.080
 convince overseas
