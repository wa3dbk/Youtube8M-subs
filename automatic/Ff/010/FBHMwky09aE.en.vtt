critter here is doing his video debut
and<00:00:08.000> I'm<00:00:09.000> just<00:00:09.330> basically<00:00:09.780> luring<00:00:10.530> him<00:00:10.769> to

00:00:10.820 --> 00:00:10.830 
and I'm just basically luring him to

00:00:10.830 --> 00:00:13.700 
and I'm just basically luring him to
spend<00:00:11.730> the<00:00:11.969> left<00:00:12.210> spin<00:00:12.630> to<00:00:12.780> the<00:00:12.870> right<00:00:12.900> trying

00:00:13.700 --> 00:00:13.710 
spend the left spin to the right trying

00:00:13.710 --> 00:00:16.099 
spend the left spin to the right trying
to<00:00:13.769> figure<00:00:14.040> out<00:00:14.280> which<00:00:14.759> direction<00:00:15.269> he<00:00:15.870> goes

00:00:16.099 --> 00:00:16.109 
to figure out which direction he goes

00:00:16.109 --> 00:00:19.490 
to figure out which direction he goes
better<00:00:16.680> in<00:00:17.010> or<00:00:17.400> worse<00:00:17.640> in<00:00:18.000> and<00:00:18.410> when<00:00:19.410> I'm

00:00:19.490 --> 00:00:19.500 
better in or worse in and when I'm

00:00:19.500 --> 00:00:21.890 
better in or worse in and when I'm
spinning<00:00:19.740> him<00:00:20.100> to<00:00:20.279> his<00:00:20.580> right<00:00:20.910> I'm<00:00:21.180> using<00:00:21.510> my

00:00:21.890 --> 00:00:21.900 
spinning him to his right I'm using my

00:00:21.900 --> 00:00:24.290 
spinning him to his right I'm using my
right<00:00:22.199> hand<00:00:22.529> I'm<00:00:22.830> going<00:00:23.039> to<00:00:23.100> spinning<00:00:23.490> hit<00:00:23.699> to

00:00:24.290 --> 00:00:24.300 
right hand I'm going to spinning hit to

00:00:24.300 --> 00:00:28.160 
right hand I'm going to spinning hit to
his<00:00:24.570> left<00:00:24.930> I<00:00:25.199> use<00:00:25.439> my<00:00:25.680> left<00:00:26.039> hand<00:00:26.990> looks<00:00:27.990> like

00:00:28.160 --> 00:00:28.170 
his left I use my left hand looks like

00:00:28.170 --> 00:00:29.419 
his left I use my left hand looks like
he's<00:00:28.320> doing<00:00:28.470> pretty<00:00:28.859> good<00:00:29.099> in<00:00:29.310> both

00:00:29.419 --> 00:00:29.429 
he's doing pretty good in both

00:00:29.429 --> 00:00:31.009 
he's doing pretty good in both
directions<00:00:29.880> and<00:00:30.390> now<00:00:30.480> I'm<00:00:30.599> just<00:00:30.810> going<00:00:30.990> to

00:00:31.009 --> 00:00:31.019 
directions and now I'm just going to

00:00:31.019 --> 00:00:33.860 
directions and now I'm just going to
choose<00:00:31.320> one<00:00:31.740> direction<00:00:32.489> to<00:00:32.610> teach<00:00:32.880> I<00:00:33.210> always

00:00:33.860 --> 00:00:33.870 
choose one direction to teach I always

00:00:33.870 --> 00:00:37.670 
choose one direction to teach I always
start<00:00:34.469> with<00:00:34.559> the<00:00:35.270> direction<00:00:36.270> in<00:00:36.690> which<00:00:36.719> they

00:00:37.670 --> 00:00:37.680 
start with the direction in which they

00:00:37.680 --> 00:00:41.540 
start with the direction in which they
do<00:00:37.739> not<00:00:38.070> turn<00:00:38.579> as<00:00:38.969> well<00:00:39.300> in<00:00:40.160> all<00:00:41.160> right<00:00:41.250> so

00:00:41.540 --> 00:00:41.550 
do not turn as well in all right so

00:00:41.550 --> 00:00:44.569 
do not turn as well in all right so
episode<00:00:42.210> didn't<00:00:42.840> go<00:00:43.020> to<00:00:43.079> her<00:00:43.710> left<00:00:43.950> as<00:00:44.219> well<00:00:44.430> as

00:00:44.569 --> 00:00:44.579 
episode didn't go to her left as well as

00:00:44.579 --> 00:00:46.580 
episode didn't go to her left as well as
her<00:00:44.789> right<00:00:45.000> so<00:00:45.329> I<00:00:45.360> chose<00:00:45.780> to<00:00:46.079> start<00:00:46.289> with<00:00:46.469> the

00:00:46.580 --> 00:00:46.590 
her right so I chose to start with the

00:00:46.590 --> 00:00:49.430 
her right so I chose to start with the
weaker<00:00:46.860> side<00:00:47.039> first<00:00:47.430> and<00:00:47.840> you<00:00:48.840> see<00:00:48.870> I<00:00:49.050> have<00:00:49.140> the

00:00:49.430 --> 00:00:49.440 
weaker side first and you see I have the

00:00:49.440 --> 00:00:51.170 
weaker side first and you see I have the
treats<00:00:49.710> in<00:00:49.860> the<00:00:50.010> left<00:00:50.280> hand<00:00:50.550> and<00:00:50.789> pretty<00:00:51.059> much

00:00:51.170 --> 00:00:51.180 
treats in the left hand and pretty much

00:00:51.180 --> 00:00:53.750 
treats in the left hand and pretty much
luring<00:00:51.539> her<00:00:51.780> around<00:00:52.110> and<00:00:52.500> then<00:00:52.649> when<00:00:52.770> she<00:00:52.949> gets

00:00:53.750 --> 00:00:53.760 
luring her around and then when she gets

00:00:53.760 --> 00:00:56.540 
luring her around and then when she gets
that<00:00:53.879> idea<00:00:54.570> of<00:00:54.690> that<00:00:54.930> I<00:00:55.230> move<00:00:55.590> my<00:00:55.739> treats<00:00:56.070> to<00:00:56.340> my

00:00:56.540 --> 00:00:56.550 
that idea of that I move my treats to my

00:00:56.550 --> 00:00:59.720 
that idea of that I move my treats to my
right<00:00:56.969> hand<00:00:57.210> and<00:00:57.570> so<00:00:58.410> signaling<00:00:58.980> with<00:00:59.160> my<00:00:59.399> left

00:00:59.720 --> 00:00:59.730 
right hand and so signaling with my left

00:00:59.730 --> 00:01:01.189 
right hand and so signaling with my left
hand<00:01:00.059> so<00:01:00.390> it's<00:01:00.510> the<00:01:00.660> hand<00:01:00.899> that's<00:01:01.079> always

00:01:01.189 --> 00:01:01.199 
hand so it's the hand that's always

00:01:01.199 --> 00:01:04.039 
hand so it's the hand that's always
going<00:01:01.500> to<00:01:01.649> cross<00:01:02.280> over<00:01:02.820> in<00:01:03.120> front<00:01:03.449> of<00:01:03.660> you<00:01:03.840> is

00:01:04.039 --> 00:01:04.049 
going to cross over in front of you is

00:01:04.049 --> 00:01:05.630 
going to cross over in front of you is
the<00:01:04.170> hand<00:01:04.409> that<00:01:04.500> you<00:01:04.710> will<00:01:04.890> use<00:01:05.100> so<00:01:05.369> going<00:01:05.549> to

00:01:05.630 --> 00:01:05.640 
the hand that you will use so going to

00:01:05.640 --> 00:01:08.750 
the hand that you will use so going to
her<00:01:05.939> left<00:01:06.210> I<00:01:06.479> use<00:01:06.750> my<00:01:07.290> left<00:01:07.619> hand<00:01:08.010> that's

00:01:08.750 --> 00:01:08.760 
her left I use my left hand that's

00:01:08.760 --> 00:01:10.880 
her left I use my left hand that's
eventually<00:01:09.060> going<00:01:09.330> to<00:01:09.479> be<00:01:09.930> the<00:01:09.960> start<00:01:10.409> of<00:01:10.619> the

00:01:10.880 --> 00:01:10.890 
eventually going to be the start of the

00:01:10.890 --> 00:01:13.310 
eventually going to be the start of the
cross<00:01:11.280> behind<00:01:11.549> signal<00:01:12.210> as<00:01:12.390> the<00:01:12.570> hand<00:01:12.780> closest

00:01:13.310 --> 00:01:13.320 
cross behind signal as the hand closest

00:01:13.320 --> 00:01:19.429 
cross behind signal as the hand closest
to<00:01:13.350> the<00:01:13.680> dog<00:01:17.840> all<00:01:18.840> right<00:01:19.020> would<00:01:19.140> have<00:01:19.170> done

00:01:19.429 --> 00:01:19.439 
to the dog all right would have done

00:01:19.439 --> 00:01:22.429 
to the dog all right would have done
that<00:01:19.560> lots<00:01:19.890> and<00:01:20.159> lots<00:01:20.310> of<00:01:20.490> times<00:01:20.790> I<00:01:21.090> start<00:01:21.689> with

00:01:22.429 --> 00:01:22.439 
that lots and lots of times I start with

00:01:22.439 --> 00:01:25.940 
that lots and lots of times I start with
my<00:01:22.740> verbal<00:01:23.100> first<00:01:23.670> so<00:01:24.210> I'll<00:01:24.330> say<00:01:24.570> left<00:01:24.930> give<00:01:25.770> my

00:01:25.940 --> 00:01:25.950 
my verbal first so I'll say left give my

00:01:25.950 --> 00:01:28.969 
my verbal first so I'll say left give my
dog<00:01:26.159> a<00:01:26.189> half<00:01:26.580> a<00:01:26.729> second<00:01:27.210> and<00:01:27.360> I'll<00:01:27.600> either<00:01:27.979> help

00:01:28.969 --> 00:01:28.979 
dog a half a second and I'll either help

00:01:28.979 --> 00:01:32.810 
dog a half a second and I'll either help
them<00:01:29.070> with<00:01:29.640> their<00:01:30.439> hand<00:01:31.439> signal<00:01:31.890> or<00:01:32.100> if<00:01:32.640> they

00:01:32.810 --> 00:01:32.820 
them with their hand signal or if they

00:01:32.820 --> 00:01:38.390 
them with their hand signal or if they
do<00:01:32.880> it<00:01:33.060> on<00:01:33.180> their<00:01:33.299> own<00:01:33.360> praise<00:01:34.200> big-time

00:01:38.390 --> 00:01:38.400 

00:01:38.400 --> 00:01:42.020 

and<00:01:39.330> then<00:01:39.960> once<00:01:40.260> your<00:01:40.470> dog<00:01:40.650> gets<00:01:41.010> it<00:01:41.220> on<00:01:41.400> verbal

00:01:42.020 --> 00:01:42.030 
and then once your dog gets it on verbal

00:01:42.030 --> 00:01:44.270 
and then once your dog gets it on verbal
only<00:01:42.420> one<00:01:42.690> direction<00:01:42.870> you<00:01:43.560> start<00:01:43.890> all<00:01:44.100> the<00:01:44.250> way

00:01:44.270 --> 00:01:44.280 
only one direction you start all the way

00:01:44.280 --> 00:01:46.010 
only one direction you start all the way
from<00:01:44.730> the<00:01:44.820> beginning<00:01:44.910> again<00:01:45.330> and<00:01:45.600> do<00:01:45.780> the

00:01:46.010 --> 00:01:46.020 
from the beginning again and do the

00:01:46.020 --> 00:01:52.250 
from the beginning again and do the
other<00:01:46.440> direction<00:01:49.790> and<00:01:50.790> you<00:01:51.020> could<00:01:52.020> start

00:01:52.250 --> 00:01:52.260 
other direction and you could start

00:01:52.260 --> 00:01:55.670 
other direction and you could start
doing<00:01:52.500> fun<00:01:53.040> things<00:01:53.340> with<00:01:53.760> 360<00:01:54.720> degrees<00:01:55.080> turns

00:01:55.670 --> 00:01:55.680 
doing fun things with 360 degrees turns

00:01:55.680 --> 00:02:32.360 
doing fun things with 360 degrees turns
around<00:01:56.040> a<00:01:56.430> cone<00:02:30.170> once<00:02:31.170> you've<00:02:31.410> taught<00:02:31.710> both

00:02:32.360 --> 00:02:32.370 
around a cone once you've taught both

00:02:32.370 --> 00:02:34.790 
around a cone once you've taught both
directions<00:02:32.970> then<00:02:33.720> you<00:02:34.080> start<00:02:34.350> putting<00:02:34.560> other

00:02:34.790 --> 00:02:34.800 
directions then you start putting other

00:02:34.800 --> 00:02:36.980 
directions then you start putting other
commands<00:02:35.340> into<00:02:35.640> it<00:02:35.790> so<00:02:36.030> the<00:02:36.150> rate<00:02:36.360> really

00:02:36.980 --> 00:02:36.990 
commands into it so the rate really

00:02:36.990 --> 00:02:40.190 
commands into it so the rate really
reacting<00:02:37.560> to<00:02:37.770> your<00:02:37.950> verbals<00:02:38.460> and<00:02:38.760> not<00:02:39.570> a<00:02:39.900> body

00:02:40.190 --> 00:02:40.200 
reacting to your verbals and not a body

00:02:40.200 --> 00:02:58.170 
reacting to your verbals and not a body
language<00:02:40.650> at<00:02:40.830> all

00:02:58.170 --> 00:02:58.180 

00:02:58.180 --> 00:03:02.380 

right

00:03:02.380 --> 00:03:02.390 

00:03:02.390 --> 00:03:06.540 

now
