anyway<00:00:28.740> I<00:00:29.010> don't<00:00:29.369> know<00:00:29.699> you'd<00:00:29.880> find<00:00:30.150> these<00:00:30.300> in

00:00:30.439 --> 00:00:30.449 
anyway I don't know you'd find these in

00:00:30.449 --> 00:00:32.420 
anyway I don't know you'd find these in
the<00:00:30.539> rare<00:00:30.720> occasion<00:00:31.199> around<00:00:31.470> Australia<00:00:32.040> in

00:00:32.420 --> 00:00:32.430 
the rare occasion around Australia in

00:00:32.430 --> 00:00:35.120 
the rare occasion around Australia in
some<00:00:33.210> of<00:00:33.300> the<00:00:33.420> arcade<00:00:33.899> parlors<00:00:34.410> more<00:00:34.620> later<00:00:34.860> on

00:00:35.120 --> 00:00:35.130 
some of the arcade parlors more later on

00:00:35.130 --> 00:00:36.500 
some of the arcade parlors more later on
but<00:00:35.370> usually<00:00:35.579> we<00:00:35.880> used<00:00:36.030> to<00:00:36.090> get<00:00:36.210> the<00:00:36.329> wood

00:00:36.500 --> 00:00:36.510 
but usually we used to get the wood

00:00:36.510 --> 00:00:39.080 
but usually we used to get the wood
cabinet<00:00:36.960> once<00:00:37.140> around<00:00:37.410> here<00:00:37.770> I<00:00:38.070> thought<00:00:38.910> the

00:00:39.080 --> 00:00:39.090 
cabinet once around here I thought the

00:00:39.090 --> 00:00:42.619 
cabinet once around here I thought the
white<00:00:39.300> looked<00:00:39.600> hot<00:00:39.840> a<00:00:39.870> snazzy<00:00:41.120> so<00:00:42.120> I<00:00:42.149> decided

00:00:42.619 --> 00:00:42.629 
white looked hot a snazzy so I decided

00:00:42.629 --> 00:00:43.610 
white looked hot a snazzy so I decided
to<00:00:42.719> go<00:00:42.899> with<00:00:42.930> this<00:00:43.140> one

00:00:43.610 --> 00:00:43.620 
to go with this one

00:00:43.620 --> 00:00:47.720 
to go with this one
instyler<00:00:44.460> than<00:00:44.670> a<00:00:44.760> wood<00:00:44.910> one<00:00:46.340> you<00:00:47.340> can<00:00:47.520> see

00:00:47.720 --> 00:00:47.730 
instyler than a wood one you can see

00:00:47.730 --> 00:00:51.380 
instyler than a wood one you can see
it's<00:00:47.850> gone<00:00:48.030> by<00:00:48.239> yen<00:00:48.829> that's<00:00:49.829> a<00:00:50.280> hundred<00:00:51.000> yen

00:00:51.380 --> 00:00:51.390 
it's gone by yen that's a hundred yen

00:00:51.390 --> 00:00:53.240 
it's gone by yen that's a hundred yen
all<00:00:51.809> the<00:00:51.989> tokens<00:00:52.469> whatever<00:00:52.770> they<00:00:52.890> use<00:00:53.070> over

00:00:53.240 --> 00:00:53.250 
all the tokens whatever they use over

00:00:53.250 --> 00:00:53.830 
all the tokens whatever they use over
there

00:00:53.830 --> 00:00:53.840 
there

00:00:53.840 --> 00:00:57.380 
there
she's<00:00:54.840> pretty<00:00:55.079> cool<00:00:55.530> now<00:00:55.800> this<00:00:55.949> one<00:00:56.190> is<00:00:57.120> right

00:00:57.380 --> 00:00:57.390 
she's pretty cool now this one is right

00:00:57.390 --> 00:00:58.880 
she's pretty cool now this one is right
enough<00:00:57.629> I<00:00:57.780> think<00:00:57.840> I<00:00:58.140> believe<00:00:58.289> it's<00:00:58.590> a<00:00:58.649> main

00:00:58.880 --> 00:00:58.890 
enough I think I believe it's a main

00:00:58.890 --> 00:01:03.740 
enough I think I believe it's a main
system<00:00:59.750> ma<00:01:01.670> ma<00:01:02.670> ma

00:01:03.740 --> 00:01:03.750 
system ma ma ma

00:01:03.750 --> 00:01:07.609 
system ma ma ma
brain<00:01:04.110> freeze<00:01:04.530> sorry<00:01:04.909> um<00:01:06.200> yeah<00:01:07.200> it<00:01:07.290> runs<00:01:07.409> off<00:01:07.560> a

00:01:07.609 --> 00:01:07.619 
brain freeze sorry um yeah it runs off a

00:01:07.619 --> 00:01:09.289 
brain freeze sorry um yeah it runs off a
main<00:01:07.799> system<00:01:07.979> main<00:01:08.430> system<00:01:08.850> so<00:01:08.939> that's<00:01:09.090> like<00:01:09.240> a

00:01:09.289 --> 00:01:09.299 
main system main system so that's like a

00:01:09.299 --> 00:01:12.590 
main system main system so that's like a
similar<00:01:09.990> like<00:01:10.260> a<00:01:10.290> ROM<00:01:10.650> in<00:01:11.070> like<00:01:11.430> an<00:01:12.000> emulator<00:01:12.420> I

00:01:12.590 --> 00:01:12.600 
similar like a ROM in like an emulator I

00:01:12.600 --> 00:01:14.660 
similar like a ROM in like an emulator I
guess<00:01:12.900> like<00:01:13.770> you<00:01:13.799> would<00:01:14.100> have<00:01:14.220> got<00:01:14.369> back<00:01:14.549> in

00:01:14.660 --> 00:01:14.670 
guess like you would have got back in

00:01:14.670 --> 00:01:15.730 
guess like you would have got back in
the<00:01:14.760> day<00:01:14.909> when<00:01:15.119> you<00:01:15.210> were<00:01:15.299> a<00:01:15.330> youngster

00:01:15.730 --> 00:01:15.740 
the day when you were a youngster

00:01:15.740 --> 00:01:19.310 
the day when you were a youngster
downloading<00:01:16.740> um<00:01:17.240> like<00:01:18.240> super<00:01:18.689> nintendo<00:01:18.840> game

00:01:19.310 --> 00:01:19.320 
downloading um like super nintendo game

00:01:19.320 --> 00:01:21.020 
downloading um like super nintendo game
roms<00:01:19.650> and<00:01:19.890> everything<00:01:20.189> so<00:01:20.340> i<00:01:20.369> guess<00:01:20.790> it<00:01:20.909> runs

00:01:21.020 --> 00:01:21.030 
roms and everything so i guess it runs

00:01:21.030 --> 00:01:23.600 
roms and everything so i guess it runs
super<00:01:21.210> similar<00:01:22.009> it<00:01:23.009> doesn't<00:01:23.310> look<00:01:23.400> like<00:01:23.520> a

00:01:23.600 --> 00:01:23.610 
super similar it doesn't look like a

00:01:23.610 --> 00:01:25.580 
super similar it doesn't look like a
computer<00:01:24.000> unit<00:01:24.150> I<00:01:24.330> believe<00:01:24.570> because<00:01:24.869> down

00:01:25.580 --> 00:01:25.590 
computer unit I believe because down

00:01:25.590 --> 00:01:27.590 
computer unit I believe because down
there<00:01:25.890> I<00:01:26.250> don't<00:01:26.700> know<00:01:26.790> if<00:01:26.909> you<00:01:27.000> guys<00:01:27.119> can<00:01:27.360> see

00:01:27.590 --> 00:01:27.600 
there I don't know if you guys can see

00:01:27.600 --> 00:01:29.510 
there I don't know if you guys can see
that<00:01:27.840> but<00:01:28.020> it's<00:01:28.170> like<00:01:28.229> computer<00:01:28.979> hard<00:01:29.220> drive

00:01:29.510 --> 00:01:29.520 
that but it's like computer hard drive

00:01:29.520 --> 00:01:33.050 
that but it's like computer hard drive
or<00:01:29.759> something<00:01:30.210> they're<00:01:31.200> like<00:01:31.470> a<00:01:31.619> full<00:01:32.060> unit

00:01:33.050 --> 00:01:33.060 
or something they're like a full unit

00:01:33.060 --> 00:01:35.630 
or something they're like a full unit
there<00:01:33.409> so<00:01:34.409> it's<00:01:34.530> not<00:01:34.619> bringing<00:01:34.979> up<00:01:35.040> cartridges

00:01:35.630 --> 00:01:35.640 
there so it's not bringing up cartridges

00:01:35.640 --> 00:01:38.179 
there so it's not bringing up cartridges
like<00:01:35.850> I've<00:01:36.030> seen<00:01:36.240> on<00:01:36.360> other<00:01:36.509> videos<00:01:36.990> but<00:01:37.890> I

00:01:38.179 --> 00:01:38.189 
like I've seen on other videos but I

00:01:38.189 --> 00:01:39.800 
like I've seen on other videos but I
reckon<00:01:38.880> that's<00:01:39.060> pretty<00:01:39.299> cool<00:01:39.540> feature

00:01:39.800 --> 00:01:39.810 
reckon that's pretty cool feature

00:01:39.810 --> 00:01:42.830 
reckon that's pretty cool feature
because<00:01:40.229> you<00:01:41.390> know<00:01:42.390> you've<00:01:42.570> got<00:01:42.689> like<00:01:42.780> a

00:01:42.830 --> 00:01:42.840 
because you know you've got like a

00:01:42.840 --> 00:01:44.870 
because you know you've got like a
thousand<00:01:43.259> like<00:01:43.530> this<00:01:44.340> one's<00:01:44.549> got<00:01:44.700> I<00:01:44.729> believe

00:01:44.870 --> 00:01:44.880 
thousand like this one's got I believe

00:01:44.880 --> 00:01:48.440 
thousand like this one's got I believe
this<00:01:45.149> one's<00:01:45.360> got<00:01:45.479> like<00:01:45.509> 1500<00:01:46.350> games<00:01:46.590> and<00:01:47.450> like

00:01:48.440 --> 00:01:48.450 
this one's got like 1500 games and like

00:01:48.450 --> 00:01:50.060 
this one's got like 1500 games and like
you'll<00:01:49.140> find<00:01:49.409> every<00:01:49.649> game<00:01:49.829> that<00:01:49.860> you've

00:01:50.060 --> 00:01:50.070 
you'll find every game that you've

00:01:50.070 --> 00:01:51.530 
you'll find every game that you've
played<00:01:50.100> anywhere<00:01:50.490> from<00:01:50.820> like<00:01:51.000> the<00:01:51.210> early<00:01:51.329> 80s

00:01:51.530 --> 00:01:51.540 
played anywhere from like the early 80s

00:01:51.540 --> 00:01:57.289 
played anywhere from like the early 80s
to<00:01:52.159> the<00:01:53.570> tool<00:01:54.570> like<00:01:54.869> the<00:01:55.560> late<00:01:55.979> 90s<00:01:56.460> to<00:01:56.670> 2000
