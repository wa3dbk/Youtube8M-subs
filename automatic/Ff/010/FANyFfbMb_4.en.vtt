00:00:01.120 --> 00:00:07.939
 there is a painter monkey called pockets 

00:00:04.640 --> 00:00:11.419
 warhol a painter monkey that every time 

00:00:07.939 --> 00:00:13.940
 they give him a paint pot he creates a work 

00:00:11.419 --> 00:00:17.510
 of art that is automatically sold to 

00:00:13.940 --> 00:00:20.240
 400 dollars already has a large number of 

00:00:17.510 --> 00:00:22.940
 works of art created and their kind of 

00:00:20.240 --> 00:00:25.940
 paintings looks a lot like the kind of 

00:00:22.940 --> 00:00:29.150
 modern painting not to those paintings 

00:00:25.940 --> 00:00:31.010
 abstract that actually, you have to 

00:00:29.150 --> 00:00:34.970
 search a lot to find the 

00:00:31.010 --> 00:00:37.670
 meaning of them not the most curious 

00:00:34.970 --> 00:00:40.010
 of this is that if a monkey is capable of 

00:00:37.670 --> 00:00:43.220
 do these paintings there will not be that 

00:00:40.010 --> 00:00:46.489
 value them so much I am against 

00:00:43.220 --> 00:00:49.250
 of this kind of art of art 

00:00:46.489 --> 00:00:52.040
 abstract because I consider much more 

00:00:49.250 --> 00:00:54.800
 pretty the art that is based on the forms 

00:00:52.040 --> 00:00:57.410
 not the art of antiquity that art in 

00:00:54.800 --> 00:00:59.809
 which they were very careful of 

00:00:57.410 --> 00:01:03.050
 paint all the shadows details 

00:00:59.809 --> 00:01:05.689
 perspectives the proportions I am 

00:01:03.050 --> 00:01:07.300
 supporter of that kind of art and I'm not 

00:01:05.689 --> 00:01:09.610
 supporter for nothing 

00:01:07.300 --> 00:01:12.490
 of modern art that is beginning to 

00:01:09.610 --> 00:01:14.770
 create today and for that I put 

00:01:12.490 --> 00:01:17.770
 example in this video a monkey that is 

00:01:14.770 --> 00:01:20.590
 able to make the same paintings of 

00:01:17.770 --> 00:01:22.660
 abstract art that all these painters 

00:01:20.590 --> 00:01:27.790
 are beginning to spread as if 

00:01:22.660 --> 00:01:29.950
 they were works of art a monkey is worth you can 

00:01:27.790 --> 00:01:32.610
 see in the next photo the monkey 

00:01:29.950 --> 00:01:35.070
 painting 

00:01:32.610 --> 00:01:39.150
 the caregiver gives her a few pots of 

00:01:35.070 --> 00:01:41.610
 painting and creates an abstract work lives 

00:01:39.150 --> 00:01:45.000
 in the storybook farm a sanctuary 

00:01:41.610 --> 00:01:48.510
 of primates in Canada where more arrived or 

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:50.280
 less in 2009 the buyers that 

00:01:48.510 --> 00:01:53.130
 they come from as far away as 

00:01:50.280 --> 00:01:56.850
 Europe and Israel have bought their 

00:01:53.130 --> 00:01:59.490
 abstract colored paintings pockets 

00:01:56.850 --> 00:02:02.550
 is named pop artist Andy 

00:01:59.490 --> 00:02:04.520
 warhol for his wild white hair but 

00:02:02.550 --> 00:02:09.310
 his paintings are said to be similar 

00:02:04.520 --> 00:02:12.400
 to the artist jackson pollock 

00:02:09.310 --> 00:02:16.030
 It first debuted as a painter in the 

00:02:12.400 --> 00:02:18.400
 year 2010 when the volunteer carmen 

00:02:16.030 --> 00:02:22.000
 team gave him some children's paint 

00:02:18.400 --> 00:02:23.770
 nontoxic to keep her busy 

00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:26.110
 relates that the monkey has a touch 

00:02:23.770 --> 00:02:30.060
 artistic but sometimes it deconcentrates 

00:02:26.110 --> 00:02:32.670
 to the degree of eating the paint 

00:02:30.060 --> 00:02:36.060
 his paintings will be exhibited in toronto 

00:02:32.670 --> 00:02:38.580
 canada and other places in the next 

00:02:36.060 --> 00:02:41.340
 months that is to say his paintings are already 

00:02:38.580 --> 00:02:44.099
 beginning to spread all over the world and 

00:02:41.340 --> 00:02:47.069
 the question is whether a monkey is capable of 

00:02:44.099 --> 00:02:49.980
 make abstract paintings just like 

00:02:47.069 --> 00:02:52.440
 a human being we should not try 

00:02:49.980 --> 00:02:55.110
 make paintings with a little more 

00:02:52.440 --> 00:02:56.860
 dedication paintings with more and more 

00:02:55.110 --> 00:02:58.960
 meanings 

00:02:56.860 --> 00:03:01.360
 if a monkey is able to do it it does not have 

00:02:58.960 --> 00:03:04.300
 no merit that a human being puts on 

00:03:01.360 --> 00:03:06.630
 to sell those same paintings at a price 

00:03:04.300 --> 00:03:06.630
 of euro
