 recipe from the quack list of my mom 

00:00:40.500 --> 00:00:45.570

00:00:43.289 --> 00:00:49.230

00:01:11.100 --> 00:01:18.270
 from core housing down against the sugar 

00:01:16.230 --> 00:01:20.130
 and the room knead the whole thing 

00:01:18.270 --> 00:01:21.690
 vigorously and let the grate 

00:01:20.130 --> 00:01:23.820

 if you still consider it can be the glory 

00:01:26.820 --> 00:01:30.120
 omit or soft to 

00:01:29.130 --> 00:01:32.160

00:01:30.120 --> 00:01:34.440
 Meanwhile we give the rest 

00:01:32.160 --> 00:01:35.910

00:01:34.440 --> 00:01:39.120

00:01:35.910 --> 00:01:41.190
 the cloves cinnamon the baking powder and to 

00:01:39.120 --> 00:01:44.490
 the hazelnuts and the almonds are still missing 

00:01:41.190 --> 00:01:48.300

00:01:44.490 --> 00:01:54.210

00:01:48.300 --> 00:01:55.590
 Knead the dough vigorously through it 

00:01:54.210 --> 00:01:56.430
