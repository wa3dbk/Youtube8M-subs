00:00:07.010 --> 00:00:11.219
 Hello you, I greet you all 

00:00:09.330 --> 00:00:13.740
 cordially to julius blog messetag 

00:00:11.219 --> 00:00:15.660
 number six on time for nikolaeus 

00:00:13.740 --> 00:00:16.920
 I thought I prepare for you 

00:00:15.660 --> 00:00:19.050
 times cookies 

00:00:16.920 --> 00:00:21.270
 but not any but that's it 

00:00:19.050 --> 00:00:23.910
 very classic typical gingerbread 

00:00:21.270 --> 00:00:25.590
 cookies and maybe that's not it 

00:00:23.910 --> 00:00:27.990
 everybody's thing but me for example 

00:00:25.590 --> 00:00:30.029
 I love to load cake at Christmas time 

00:00:27.990 --> 00:00:32.189
 Here is the complete recipe 

00:00:30.029 --> 00:00:33.719
 every case in the infobox and otherwise 

00:00:32.189 --> 00:00:35.399
 I would say we and I start 

00:00:33.719 --> 00:00:38.399
 I wish you a lot of fun 

00:00:35.399 --> 00:00:42.059
 what do we need big question 

00:00:38.399 --> 00:00:44.460
 need more 2050 quite important brown 

00:00:42.059 --> 00:00:47.960
 sugar we need powdered sugar one 

00:00:44.460 --> 00:00:53.940
 pinch salt of liquid honey 

00:00:47.960 --> 00:00:58.230
 gingerbread spice baking powder and nut 

00:00:53.940 --> 00:01:02.910
 an egg otherwise a bowl one 

00:00:58.230 --> 00:01:05.640
 pot a hand mixer and possibly 

00:01:02.910 --> 00:01:07.799
 a balance so that all we first 

00:01:05.640 --> 00:01:14.869
 we add 100 grams of brown 

00:01:07.799 --> 00:01:14.869
 Add sugar to the pot then add 100 grams of butter 

00:01:17.960 --> 00:01:23.009
 and last but not least 150 grams 

00:01:21.150 --> 00:01:24.600
 liquid honey pure I 'm here 

00:01:23.009 --> 00:01:25.650
 For the wild good honey decided that 

00:01:24.600 --> 00:01:27.810
 I like the most 

00:01:25.650 --> 00:01:29.820
 and there we have to heat up the whole thing 

00:01:27.810 --> 00:01:32.159
 the sugar dissolved properly 

00:01:29.820 --> 00:01:34.560
 In the meantime, we take care of ourselves 

00:01:32.159 --> 00:01:37.070
 the bowl and pack there 300 grams 

00:01:34.560 --> 00:01:37.070
 more a 

00:01:38.030 --> 00:01:43.070
 then two teaspoons of baking powder 

00:01:54.740 --> 00:01:59.060
 then it comes to that gingerbread spice me 

00:01:57.320 --> 00:02:00.890
 I had only peppercakes at home 

00:01:59.060 --> 00:02:03.259
 spiced but it really is 

00:02:00.890 --> 00:02:05.509
 real gingerbread a real one 

00:02:03.259 --> 00:02:06.950
 gingerbread spice and then we add 

00:02:05.509 --> 00:02:08.599
 even with pure and then that will 

00:02:06.950 --> 00:02:10.670
 whole once completely together 

00:02:08.599 --> 00:02:12.230
 mixed but before that comes one more 

00:02:10.670 --> 00:02:13.510
 salt and I would have that free now 

00:02:12.230 --> 00:02:15.590
 already works forget 

00:02:13.510 --> 00:02:17.780
 that's my water again 

00:02:15.590 --> 00:02:23.060
 running in the mouth so lead now 

00:02:17.780 --> 00:02:25.550
 we are all about that in the meantime 

00:02:23.060 --> 00:02:29.019
 because the sugar is well dissolved and 

00:02:25.550 --> 00:02:29.019
 that means we can start 

00:02:29.950 --> 00:02:35.660
 to our mixture comes now also 

00:02:33.049 --> 00:02:39.519
 a pure and then of course the 

00:02:35.660 --> 00:02:47.090
 Complete liquid sugar with the honey 

00:02:39.519 --> 00:02:49.850
 nice sweet the whole is then with a 

00:02:47.090 --> 00:02:51.950
 hand mixer better would be even 

00:02:49.850 --> 00:02:53.120
 but they had that crooked now 

00:02:51.950 --> 00:02:54.260
 not found I do not know where the 

00:02:53.120 --> 00:02:55.819
 fly around again 

00:02:54.260 --> 00:02:57.380
 That's why I did it with them 

00:02:55.819 --> 00:02:59.180
 but with kneading I still believe it 

00:02:57.380 --> 00:03:01.579
 easier and then we stir it that way 

00:02:59.180 --> 00:03:03.590
 long until a smooth mass arises and 

00:03:01.579 --> 00:03:06.500
 now the hook comes in the matter of 

00:03:03.590 --> 00:03:09.560
 Whole day must be in the for twelve hours 

00:03:06.500 --> 00:03:11.359
 fridge and that means we have to 

00:03:09.560 --> 00:03:13.480
 wait and wait but what are they 

00:03:11.359 --> 00:03:16.730
 twelve hours 

00:03:13.480 --> 00:03:18.079
 next day new luck was the dough 

00:03:16.730 --> 00:03:20.390
 now twelve hours or I believe in 

00:03:18.079 --> 00:03:22.489
 me even 14 hours in the fridge 

00:03:20.390 --> 00:03:25.190
 that means now we only need 

00:03:22.489 --> 00:03:27.079
 our role, of course, is ours 

00:03:25.190 --> 00:03:27.709
 get out of shape and then it can too 

00:03:27.079 --> 00:03:29.390
 start 

00:03:27.709 --> 00:03:32.569
 I have on my work surface now 

00:03:29.390 --> 00:03:33.950
 put up a little bit this film 

00:03:32.569 --> 00:03:36.290
 I can not get her name 

00:03:33.950 --> 00:03:37.609
 then it's easier for me if 

00:03:36.290 --> 00:03:39.829
 the gingerbread does not dissolve because there 

00:03:37.609 --> 00:03:41.329
 it is very shaky you can now too 

00:03:39.829 --> 00:03:43.639
 I think I recognize it very well now 

00:03:41.329 --> 00:03:44.840
 a very sticky affair 

00:03:43.639 --> 00:03:47.600
 Of course, that's why I'm a bit too 

00:03:44.840 --> 00:03:50.510
 Flour on strewn on strewn like yourself 

00:03:47.600 --> 00:03:52.190
 that sounds like salt strews like that and then 

00:03:50.510 --> 00:03:55.790
 of course, so I can get that out too 

00:03:52.190 --> 00:03:58.100
 I choose this whole sticky mass 

00:03:55.790 --> 00:04:01.900
 my hands and probably the whole 

00:03:58.100 --> 00:04:01.900
 dough lumps from it 

00:04:05.120 --> 00:04:11.510
 so how now the best now it runs 

00:04:10.099 --> 00:04:13.519
 again the water in the mouth together the 

00:04:11.510 --> 00:04:15.860
 smelled so delicious when I got that 

00:04:13.519 --> 00:04:18.590
 I did it when I finally got it 

00:04:15.860 --> 00:04:21.109
 will have made the dough, of course, 

00:04:18.590 --> 00:04:22.280
 cleared up before your role with 

00:04:21.109 --> 00:04:24.530
 flour a 

00:04:22.280 --> 00:04:26.419
 Rowing then easier and then 

00:04:24.530 --> 00:04:29.020
 is the most beautiful part namely the 

00:04:26.419 --> 00:04:29.020
 outdo 

00:04:42.250 --> 00:04:49.069
 So overall I have around and at 70 

00:04:45.770 --> 00:04:50.930
 until 80 suddenly got cookies out 

00:04:49.069 --> 00:04:53.240
 and if you've got everything out 

00:04:50.930 --> 00:04:55.729
 then on a baking sheet with baking paper 

00:04:53.240 --> 00:04:59.080
 and then off in the oven that has namely 

00:04:55.729 --> 00:05:02.240
 previously preheated to 180 degrees 

00:04:59.080 --> 00:05:04.900
 and yes they need to and around ten 

00:05:02.240 --> 00:05:07.310
 They can not be 15 minutes longer 

00:05:04.900 --> 00:05:08.690
 and then very important if you then 

00:05:07.310 --> 00:05:12.909
 are done they must also such a 

00:05:08.690 --> 00:05:12.909
 grid to cool and cool 

00:05:16.300 --> 00:05:22.280
 while the first sheet is cooling down 

00:05:20.389 --> 00:05:25.250
 of course the whole rest of the dough 

00:05:22.280 --> 00:05:28.000
 rolled out and gouged out with it 

00:05:25.250 --> 00:05:31.569
 of course for family friends and co 

00:05:28.000 --> 00:05:35.500
 has beautiful gingerbread cookies 

00:05:31.569 --> 00:05:35.500
 I love that at Christmas time 

00:05:47.380 --> 00:05:50.800
 Of course you can be here too 

00:05:49.270 --> 00:05:53.320
 now with me, for example, so should 

00:05:50.800 --> 00:05:54.610
 bells are with every gingerbread 

00:05:53.320 --> 00:05:56.080
 of course you can cook too 

00:05:54.610 --> 00:05:57.550
 make holes clean then they could not 

00:05:56.080 --> 00:05:59.380
 Hanging on the Christmas tree or hanging 

00:05:57.550 --> 00:06:01.000
 make a present or something 

00:05:59.380 --> 00:06:11.020
 easy to decorate with the ribbon 

00:06:01.000 --> 00:06:14.050
 that is not a problem so for 

00:06:11.020 --> 00:06:16.540
 I take a protein for our frosting 

00:06:14.050 --> 00:06:23.620
 very important juggles that nicely 

00:06:16.540 --> 00:06:27.630
 that you only have protein and the whole 

00:06:23.620 --> 00:06:27.630
 is then stirred until creamy and creamy 

00:06:34.320 --> 00:06:40.960
 really full pulley 

00:06:36.450 --> 00:06:45.000
 if that happens you pack with 215 

00:06:40.960 --> 00:06:47.470
 up to 250 grams of powdered sugar with pure 

00:06:45.000 --> 00:06:49.210
 But I do not have it all 

00:06:47.470 --> 00:06:51.190
 I have to say clean because I am 

00:06:49.210 --> 00:06:52.690
 not on all biscuits so much 

00:06:51.190 --> 00:06:55.120
 I would like to have some, too 

00:06:52.690 --> 00:06:57.700
 just like having gingerbread cookies 

00:06:55.120 --> 00:07:00.640
 and if that is creamy then 

00:06:57.700 --> 00:07:02.050
 it already in euro yes I do not know 

00:07:00.640 --> 00:07:03.850
 if you just do it with your hand or 

00:07:02.050 --> 00:07:06.100
 make a brush I have here now 

00:07:03.850 --> 00:07:08.530
 such a hat for what had 

00:07:06.100 --> 00:07:09.850
 expired is my apartment wanted 

00:07:08.530 --> 00:07:12.700
 already say my kitchen looked like one 

00:07:09.850 --> 00:07:14.620
 Saustall everywhere says glued but well 

00:07:12.700 --> 00:07:16.990
 and then you can cook your cookies 

00:07:14.620 --> 00:07:18.640
 Decorate like her since I am funny 

00:07:16.990 --> 00:07:20.950
 I had to hurry because I was 

00:07:18.640 --> 00:07:22.600
 alone and I have in time too 

00:07:20.950 --> 00:07:24.550
 always the cookies back in the oven 

00:07:22.600 --> 00:07:27.280
 that's why I was not like that now 

00:07:24.550 --> 00:07:28.900
 creative main thing everywhere on it and 

00:07:27.280 --> 00:07:31.060
 then you can of course with it 

00:07:28.900 --> 00:07:34.650
 chocolate flakes or chocolate sprinkles 

00:07:31.060 --> 00:07:37.030
 or smarties or the vulture still knows 

00:07:34.650 --> 00:07:39.070
 let your imagination run free and 

00:07:37.030 --> 00:07:41.200
 that sticking and digging everything with it 

00:07:39.070 --> 00:07:44.200
 and then you did it then 

00:07:41.200 --> 00:07:46.420
 gingerbread cookies have sprung up and 

00:07:44.200 --> 00:07:47.290
 I have to say I think it's super awesome 

00:07:46.420 --> 00:07:49.330
 delicious 

00:07:47.290 --> 00:07:51.340
 Of course I really hope that 

00:07:49.330 --> 00:07:53.830
 you liked the video too though 

00:07:51.340 --> 00:07:55.120
 maybe one two three four five six 

00:07:53.830 --> 00:07:56.380
 there are seven eight with it 

00:07:55.120 --> 00:07:57.689
 Maybe you do not like them 

00:07:56.380 --> 00:07:59.219
 no gingerbread at all 

00:07:57.689 --> 00:08:00.899
 For me, it's time to go Christmas 

00:07:59.219 --> 00:08:03.959
 but it will be even now 

00:08:00.899 --> 00:08:06.059
 further the three stories 

00:08:03.959 --> 00:08:08.719
 happen in this sense until tomorrow 

00:08:06.059 --> 00:08:08.719
 gysi
