00:01:59.619 --> 00:02:01.230 
and my skin smelled amazing and it
didn't<00:01:59.799> get<00:01:59.890> irritated<00:02:00.459> so<00:02:00.640> I<00:02:00.670> would<00:02:00.970> go<00:02:01.119> with

00:02:01.230 --> 00:02:01.240 
didn't get irritated so I would go with

00:02:01.240 --> 00:02:03.600 
didn't get irritated so I would go with
10<00:02:01.479> drops<00:02:01.750> or<00:02:01.929> less<00:02:02.229> if<00:02:02.530> you<00:02:03.069> decide<00:02:03.369> to<00:02:03.520> use

00:02:03.600 --> 00:02:03.610 
10 drops or less if you decide to use

00:02:03.610 --> 00:02:05.969 
10 drops or less if you decide to use
the<00:02:03.759> oil<00:02:03.939> and<00:02:04.240> I<00:02:05.020> just<00:02:05.049> mixed<00:02:05.619> it<00:02:05.709> up<00:02:05.770> right

00:02:05.969 --> 00:02:05.979 
the oil and I just mixed it up right

00:02:05.979 --> 00:02:07.710 
the oil and I just mixed it up right
here<00:02:06.250> and<00:02:06.429> the<00:02:06.549> best<00:02:06.729> way<00:02:06.880> for<00:02:07.090> me<00:02:07.239> to<00:02:07.270> mix<00:02:07.569> it

00:02:07.710 --> 00:02:07.720 
here and the best way for me to mix it

00:02:07.720 --> 00:02:10.289 
here and the best way for me to mix it
up<00:02:07.810> was<00:02:08.049> kind<00:02:08.649> of<00:02:08.739> smashing<00:02:09.280> the<00:02:09.489> oil<00:02:09.729> clumps

00:02:10.289 --> 00:02:10.299 
up was kind of smashing the oil clumps

00:02:10.299 --> 00:02:12.900 
up was kind of smashing the oil clumps
against<00:02:10.630> the<00:02:10.720> wall<00:02:10.989> of<00:02:11.019> the<00:02:11.709> mixing<00:02:12.610> bowl<00:02:12.760> and

00:02:12.900 --> 00:02:12.910 
against the wall of the mixing bowl and

00:02:12.910 --> 00:02:14.699 
against the wall of the mixing bowl and
it<00:02:13.030> ended<00:02:13.239> up<00:02:13.360> blending<00:02:13.810> it<00:02:13.989> pretty<00:02:14.230> well<00:02:14.410> if

00:02:14.699 --> 00:02:14.709 
it ended up blending it pretty well if

00:02:14.709 --> 00:02:16.229 
it ended up blending it pretty well if
that<00:02:15.190> doesn't<00:02:15.549> work<00:02:15.610> you<00:02:15.790> can<00:02:15.910> always<00:02:15.940> use<00:02:16.209> a

00:02:16.229 --> 00:02:16.239 
that doesn't work you can always use a

00:02:16.239 --> 00:02:19.860 
that doesn't work you can always use a
fork<00:02:16.569> and<00:02:17.200> now<00:02:17.380> I'm<00:02:17.650> putting<00:02:17.920> in<00:02:18.280> around<00:02:18.910> three

00:02:19.860 --> 00:02:19.870 
fork and now I'm putting in around three

00:02:19.870 --> 00:02:21.930 
fork and now I'm putting in around three
tablespoons<00:02:20.709> which<00:02:21.069> is<00:02:21.220> just<00:02:21.459> three<00:02:21.790> big

00:02:21.930 --> 00:02:21.940 
tablespoons which is just three big

00:02:21.940 --> 00:02:23.850 
tablespoons which is just three big
spoonfuls<00:02:22.569> because<00:02:22.930> my<00:02:23.079> tablespoon<00:02:23.560> wouldn't

00:02:23.850 --> 00:02:23.860 
spoonfuls because my tablespoon wouldn't

00:02:23.860 --> 00:02:26.940 
spoonfuls because my tablespoon wouldn't
fit<00:02:24.040> in<00:02:24.130> the<00:02:24.190> bottom<00:02:24.370> of<00:02:25.200> coconut<00:02:26.200> oil<00:02:26.410> there

00:02:26.940 --> 00:02:26.950 
fit in the bottom of coconut oil there

00:02:26.950 --> 00:02:30.420 
fit in the bottom of coconut oil there
and<00:02:27.540> as<00:02:28.540> you<00:02:28.930> mix<00:02:29.170> it<00:02:29.380> it<00:02:29.560> becomes<00:02:29.920> more<00:02:30.220> of<00:02:30.310> a

00:02:30.420 --> 00:02:30.430 
and as you mix it it becomes more of a

00:02:30.430 --> 00:02:32.099 
and as you mix it it becomes more of a
solid<00:02:30.819> I<00:02:30.970> mean<00:02:31.239> of<00:02:31.420> I'm<00:02:31.690> going<00:02:31.810> to<00:02:31.870> make<00:02:31.959> sure

00:02:32.099 --> 00:02:32.109 
solid I mean of I'm going to make sure

00:02:32.109 --> 00:02:34.740 
solid I mean of I'm going to make sure
it's<00:02:32.230> liquid<00:02:32.560> form<00:02:32.889> and<00:02:33.359> you<00:02:34.359> just<00:02:34.510> wanna<00:02:34.660> make

00:02:34.740 --> 00:02:34.750 
it's liquid form and you just wanna make

00:02:34.750 --> 00:02:36.059 
it's liquid form and you just wanna make
sure<00:02:34.810> all<00:02:35.079> your<00:02:35.230> ingredients<00:02:35.799> are<00:02:35.920> blended

00:02:36.059 --> 00:02:36.069 
sure all your ingredients are blended

00:02:36.069 --> 00:02:38.309 
sure all your ingredients are blended
because<00:02:36.819> you're<00:02:37.000> making<00:02:37.120> a<00:02:37.450> blended<00:02:37.989> mixture

00:02:38.309 --> 00:02:38.319 
because you're making a blended mixture

00:02:38.319 --> 00:02:42.410 
because you're making a blended mixture
so<00:02:38.680> why<00:02:38.859> would<00:02:39.010> you<00:02:39.100> not<00:02:39.250> want<00:02:39.459> it<00:02:39.579> blended

00:02:42.410 --> 00:02:42.420 

00:02:42.420 --> 00:02:44.250 

well<00:02:43.420> you<00:02:43.540> want<00:02:43.690> to<00:02:43.750> make<00:02:43.840> sure<00:02:43.959> it's<00:02:44.109> going<00:02:44.200> to

00:02:44.250 --> 00:02:44.260 
well you want to make sure it's going to

00:02:44.260 --> 00:02:45.690 
well you want to make sure it's going to
be<00:02:44.319> a<00:02:44.410> darker<00:02:44.709> color<00:02:44.950> because<00:02:45.310> it<00:02:45.430> has<00:02:45.519> the<00:02:45.670> oil

00:02:45.690 --> 00:02:45.700 
be a darker color because it has the oil

00:02:45.700 --> 00:02:47.520 
be a darker color because it has the oil
mixed<00:02:46.209> in<00:02:46.299> once<00:02:46.480> it's<00:02:46.690> done<00:02:46.900> but<00:02:47.200> once<00:02:47.380> it

00:02:47.520 --> 00:02:47.530 
mixed in once it's done but once it

00:02:47.530 --> 00:02:49.770 
mixed in once it's done but once it
reaches<00:02:47.950> a<00:02:48.100> smooth<00:02:48.730> consistency<00:02:49.329> you're<00:02:49.569> just

course materials in the scrub help scrub

00:03:01.930 --> 00:03:03.870 
course materials in the scrub help scrub
away<00:03:02.049> your<00:03:02.440> extra<00:03:02.799> dead<00:03:03.010> skin<00:03:03.370> cells<00:03:03.639> on<00:03:03.850> top

00:03:03.880 --> 00:03:06.449 
away your extra dead skin cells on top
and<00:03:04.389> it<00:03:05.139> also<00:03:05.319> helps<00:03:05.680> with<00:03:05.769> cellulite<00:03:06.280> because

00:03:06.449 --> 00:03:06.459 
and it also helps with cellulite because

00:03:06.459 --> 00:03:08.009 
and it also helps with cellulite because
it<00:03:06.700> helps<00:03:06.910> open<00:03:07.030> those<00:03:07.299> pores<00:03:07.569> up<00:03:07.750> and<00:03:07.930> then

00:03:08.009 --> 00:03:08.019 
it helps open those pores up and then

00:03:08.019 --> 00:03:10.410 
it helps open those pores up and then
water<00:03:08.200> can<00:03:08.470> be<00:03:08.590> absorbed<00:03:09.010> into<00:03:09.160> the<00:03:09.420> sections

00:03:10.410 --> 00:03:10.420 
water can be absorbed into the sections

00:03:10.420 --> 00:03:13.140 
water can be absorbed into the sections
