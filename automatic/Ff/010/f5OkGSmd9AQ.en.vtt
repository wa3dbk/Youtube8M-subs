need to make the knob bigger that's why

00:00:35.640 --> 00:00:37.459 
need to make the knob bigger that's why
I'm<00:00:35.700> we're<00:00:35.910> taping<00:00:36.090> this<00:00:36.270> and<00:00:36.840> I<00:00:36.930> just<00:00:37.140> decided

00:00:37.459 --> 00:00:37.469 
I'm we're taping this and I just decided

00:00:37.469 --> 00:00:39.260 
I'm we're taping this and I just decided
to<00:00:37.590> make<00:00:37.680> a<00:00:37.770> video<00:00:37.950> and<00:00:38.280> there's<00:00:38.850> tape<00:00:39.090> over

00:00:39.260 --> 00:00:39.270 
to make a video and there's tape over

00:00:39.270 --> 00:00:41.510 
to make a video and there's tape over
this<00:00:39.510> because<00:00:39.960> there<00:00:40.350> is<00:00:40.469> an<00:00:40.620> end<00:00:40.829> plug<00:00:41.100> in<00:00:41.370> it

00:00:41.510 --> 00:00:41.520 
this because there is an end plug in it

00:00:41.520 --> 00:00:49.369 
this because there is an end plug in it
and<00:00:43.309> the<00:00:44.309> tape<00:00:44.550> just<00:00:44.940> kind<00:00:45.210> of<00:00:48.230> covers<00:00:49.230> up<00:00:49.350> the

00:00:49.369 --> 00:00:49.379 
and the tape just kind of covers up the

00:00:49.379 --> 00:00:51.860 
and the tape just kind of covers up the
top<00:00:49.739> part<00:00:49.770> there<00:00:50.370> where<00:00:51.090> you<00:00:51.239> can't<00:00:51.480> put<00:00:51.690> up

00:00:51.860 --> 00:00:51.870 
top part there where you can't put up

00:00:51.870 --> 00:00:56.479 
top part there where you can't put up
and<00:00:52.199> plug<00:00:52.710> in<00:00:52.920> or<00:00:54.829> plug<00:00:55.829> hanging<00:00:56.160> on<00:00:56.250> I<00:00:56.280> mean

00:00:56.479 --> 00:00:56.489 
and plug in or plug hanging on I mean

00:00:56.489 --> 00:01:01.520 
and plug in or plug hanging on I mean
and<00:00:59.270> it<00:01:00.270> just<00:01:00.510> covers<00:01:00.660> up<00:01:00.870> the<00:01:00.930> little<00:01:01.260> scene

00:01:01.520 --> 00:01:01.530 
and it just covers up the little scene

00:01:01.530 --> 00:01:06.109 
and it just covers up the little scene
can't<00:01:02.160> even<00:01:02.430> see<00:01:02.910> the<00:01:03.059> scene<00:01:03.300> there<00:01:03.570> at<00:01:03.660> all<00:01:05.119> so

00:01:06.109 --> 00:01:06.119 
can't even see the scene there at all so

00:01:06.119 --> 00:01:07.850 
can't even see the scene there at all so
instead<00:01:06.510> of<00:01:06.570> going<00:01:07.080> through<00:01:07.260> all<00:01:07.470> this<00:01:07.680> like

00:01:07.850 --> 00:01:07.860 
instead of going through all this like

00:01:07.860 --> 00:01:11.179 
instead of going through all this like
hot<00:01:08.100> glue<00:01:08.369> and<00:01:08.700> sanding<00:01:09.330> and<00:01:09.570> putty<00:01:09.979> stuff<00:01:10.979> I

00:01:11.179 --> 00:01:11.189 
hot glue and sanding and putty stuff I

00:01:11.189 --> 00:01:13.490 
hot glue and sanding and putty stuff I
just<00:01:11.220> decided<00:01:11.700> not<00:01:11.850> to<00:01:11.970> do<00:01:12.150> that<00:01:12.330> and<00:01:13.260> just

00:01:13.490 --> 00:01:13.500 
just decided not to do that and just

00:01:13.500 --> 00:01:16.280 
just decided not to do that and just
cover<00:01:13.680> it<00:01:13.740> with<00:01:13.890> tape<00:01:14.070> and<00:01:14.400> that's<00:01:14.640> why<00:01:15.570> I<00:01:15.600> put

00:01:16.280 --> 00:01:16.290 
cover it with tape and that's why I put

00:01:16.290 --> 00:01:20.480 
cover it with tape and that's why I put
tape<00:01:16.680> over<00:01:17.040> this<00:01:17.369> little<00:01:17.640> part<00:01:17.880> here<00:01:17.939> -<00:01:19.490> just

00:02:53.059 --> 00:02:53.069 

00:02:53.069 --> 00:02:55.800

00:02:58.559 --> 00:02:58.569 
didn't get the same feel in the same

00:02:58.569 --> 00:03:02.780 
didn't get the same feel in the same
control<00:02:59.700> so<00:03:00.700> this<00:03:01.000> is<00:03:01.150> just<00:03:01.329> gonna<00:03:01.540> hopefully

00:03:02.780 --> 00:03:02.790 
control so this is just gonna hopefully

00:03:02.790 --> 00:03:09.180 
control so this is just gonna hopefully
help<00:03:05.220> so<00:03:06.220> yeah<00:03:06.600> still<00:03:07.600> not<00:03:07.810> too<00:03:08.049> too<00:03:08.230> big<00:03:08.410> but<00:03:08.859> a

00:03:09.180 --> 00:03:09.190 
help so yeah still not too too big but a

00:03:09.190 --> 00:03:11.039 
help so yeah still not too too big but a
lot<00:03:09.609> bigger<00:03:09.880> than<00:03:09.910> what<00:03:10.180> I'm<00:03:10.299> used<00:03:10.450> to<00:03:10.569> and

00:03:11.039 --> 00:03:11.049 
lot bigger than what I'm used to and

00:03:11.049 --> 00:03:14.000 
lot bigger than what I'm used to and
then<00:03:11.500> I<00:03:11.620> just<00:03:11.829> taped<00:03:12.220> down<00:03:12.880> around<00:03:13.239> it

00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:14.010 
then I just taped down around it

00:03:14.010 --> 00:03:29.600 
then I just taped down around it
normally<00:03:16.380> just<00:03:17.380> pull<00:03:17.709> it<00:03:17.769> really<00:03:17.920> tight<00:03:18.010> there

00:03:29.600 --> 00:03:29.610 

00:03:29.610 --> 00:03:36.800 

and<00:03:30.590> try<00:03:31.590> to<00:03:32.540> not<00:03:33.540> have<00:03:33.570> any<00:03:34.560> wrinkles<00:03:35.250> in<00:03:35.880> the

00:03:36.800 --> 00:03:36.810 
and try to not have any wrinkles in the

00:03:36.810 --> 00:03:41.360 
and try to not have any wrinkles in the
tape<00:03:37.080> just<00:03:37.440> makes<00:03:38.100> it<00:03:38.310> feel<00:03:39.300> better<00:03:40.370> and

00:03:41.360 --> 00:03:41.370 
tape just makes it feel better and

00:03:41.370 --> 00:03:43.490 
tape just makes it feel better and
smoother<00:03:42.090> should<00:03:42.750> get<00:03:42.870> a<00:03:42.900> better<00:03:43.080> feel<00:03:43.470> for

00:03:43.490 --> 00:03:43.500 
smoother should get a better feel for

00:03:43.500 --> 00:03:48.200 
smoother should get a better feel for
the<00:03:44.630> stick<00:03:46.460> and<00:03:47.460> then<00:03:47.610> when<00:03:47.730> I<00:03:47.760> get<00:03:47.910> to<00:03:47.970> her
