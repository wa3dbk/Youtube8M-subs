00:01:19.490 --> 00:01:21.670 

the<00:01:20.030> first<00:01:20.270> step<00:01:20.540> in<00:01:20.690> getting<00:01:20.720> your<00:01:20.990> aerial<00:01:21.500> is

00:01:21.670 --> 00:01:21.680 
the first step in getting your aerial is

00:01:21.680 --> 00:01:25.810 
the first step in getting your aerial is
having<00:01:22.070> a<00:01:22.220> good<00:01:22.430> hurdle<00:01:24.159> after<00:01:25.159> you<00:01:25.549> get<00:01:25.729> your

00:01:27.550 --> 00:01:27.560 
hurdle down you can practice hurdling

00:01:27.560 --> 00:01:31.420 
hurdle down you can practice hurdling
into<00:01:27.680> a<00:01:27.830> cartwheel<00:01:30.190> next<00:01:31.190> you<00:01:31.400> should

00:01:31.420 --> 00:01:31.430 
into a cartwheel next you should

00:01:31.430 --> 00:01:33.520 
into a cartwheel next you should
practice<00:01:32.000> dive<00:01:32.270> and<00:01:32.540> pop<00:01:32.750> cartwheels<00:01:33.229> to<00:01:33.409> get

00:01:33.520 --> 00:01:33.530 
practice dive and pop cartwheels to get
