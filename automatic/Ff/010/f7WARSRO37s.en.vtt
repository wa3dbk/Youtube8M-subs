 That this will become another 

00:02:05.530 --> 00:02:12.890
 I think you were making a pretty high declaration 

00:02:09.860 --> 00:02:14.410
 Great for Mac users of 

00:02:12.890 --> 00:02:17.280
 Breakthrough 

00:02:14.410 --> 00:02:21.400
 It did not seem to be 

00:02:17.280 --> 00:02:25.950
 Who uses Macs from 

00:02:21.400 --> 00:02:27.390

00:02:36.970 --> 00:02:41.680
 my partner ios and mac os seam approaching another more and more 

00:02:40.990 --> 00:02:43.910

00:02:41.680 --> 00:02:45.710
 Like throwing in a row 

00:02:43.910 --> 00:02:48.750
 of time 

00:02:45.710 --> 00:02:51.320
 I am strengthening this 

00:02:48.750 --> 00:02:51.320
 What is 

00:02:51.350 --> 00:02:56.090
 Someone who uses iphone 

00:02:54.960 --> 00:02:58.710
 But 

00:02:56.090 --> 00:03:03.810
 pc is windows -1 

00:02:58.710 --> 00:03:07.850
 That the tremendous appeal effect on the 

00:03:03.810 --> 00:03:09.280
 For those who use iphone 

00:03:07.850 --> 00:03:10.560
 Crap 

00:03:09.280 --> 00:03:12.690
 The 

00:03:10.560 --> 00:03:17.370
 Make me think 

00:03:12.690 --> 00:03:21.150
 It's supposed to be something that will become useful later on 

00:03:17.370 --> 00:03:22.330
 Well if you only use iphone, it is better to have a pc 

00:03:21.150 --> 00:03:25.290

 If there is a second Mac 

00:03:40.590 --> 00:03:48.569
 If it is imac from the continuation from the middle 

00:03:45.690 --> 00:03:54.209
 Seems to be able to do the best 

00:03:48.569 --> 00:03:59.490
 The thing is that Mc color points can not be added 

00:03:54.209 --> 00:04:05.280
 Once integrated why is it this device is the 

00:03:59.490 --> 00:04:06.720

00:04:20.959 --> 00:04:27.410
