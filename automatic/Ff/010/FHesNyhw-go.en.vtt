and<00:00:17.770> you're<00:00:18.520> going<00:00:18.610> to<00:00:18.670> scale<00:00:19.090> up<00:00:19.390> the<00:00:20.010> pole

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:21.010 
and you're going to scale up the pole

and you're going to scale up the pole
here<00:00:21.340> that's<00:00:21.520> sort<00:00:21.699> of<00:00:21.730> fallen<00:00:22.150> make<00:00:22.510> sure

00:00:22.529 --> 00:00:22.539

across here it's not like the other ones
where<00:00:26.500> you<00:00:26.619> can<00:00:26.740> just<00:00:26.769> sort<00:00:27.250> of<00:00:27.340> sprint<00:00:27.670> across

00:00:27.900 --> 00:00:27.910

00:00:30.960 --> 00:00:30.970 
going to be a little bit accurate when

them<00:00:59.979> off<00:01:00.190> at<00:01:00.610> this<00:01:00.909> point<00:01:01.119> here<00:01:01.360> it<00:01:01.420> doesn't

00:01:01.560 --> 00:01:01.570

00:01:01.570 --> 00:01:02.850 
them off at this point here it doesn't
really<00:01:01.750> matter<00:01:01.930> if<00:01:02.170> you<00:01:02.290> want<00:01:02.379> to<00:01:02.500> go<00:01:02.559> for<00:01:02.739> more

there<00:01:06.310> you<00:01:07.000> can<00:01:07.180> jump<00:01:07.420> just<00:01:07.720> like<00:01:07.869> I<00:01:08.020> did<00:01:08.080> and

00:01:08.400 --> 00:01:08.410 
there you can jump just like I did and

get a stealth kill there but sooner or

00:01:10.030 --> 00:01:11.640

mean<00:01:12.130> I<00:01:12.220> got<00:01:12.370> a<00:01:12.400> little<00:01:12.550> sloppy<00:01:12.880> here<00:01:13.210> and<00:01:13.300> that

00:01:13.380 --> 00:01:13.390 
mean I got a little sloppy here and that

00:01:13.390 --> 00:01:15.990 
mean I got a little sloppy here and that
guy<00:01:13.570> notice<00:01:13.930> me<00:01:14.140> but<00:01:14.380> I<00:01:14.620> mean<00:01:15.520> you<00:01:15.640> can<00:01:15.820> get<00:01:15.970> a

00:01:15.990 --> 00:01:16.000 
guy notice me but I mean you can get a

00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:19.500 
guy notice me but I mean you can get a
lot<00:01:16.360> of<00:01:16.830> probably<00:01:17.830> about<00:01:18.130> another<00:01:18.400> 23<00:01:19.180> scalp

00:01:19.500 --> 00:01:19.510 
lot of probably about another 23 scalp

00:01:19.510 --> 00:01:21.390 
lot of probably about another 23 scalp
kills<00:01:19.750> easy<00:01:20.020> well<00:01:20.710> if<00:01:20.860> you're<00:01:20.980> really<00:01:21.250> good

00:01:21.390 --> 00:01:21.400 
kills easy well if you're really good

00:01:21.400 --> 00:01:22.560 
kills easy well if you're really good
you<00:01:21.430> can<00:01:21.610> probably<00:01:21.760> stealth<00:01:22.090> kill<00:01:22.300> all<00:01:22.450> the

00:01:22.560 --> 00:01:22.570 
you can probably stealth kill all the

00:01:22.570 --> 00:01:25.530 
you can probably stealth kill all the
way<00:01:22.660> down<00:01:22.840> to<00:01:22.870> the<00:01:23.080> bottom<00:01:23.260> but<00:01:23.890> eventually<00:01:24.540> it

00:01:25.530 --> 00:01:25.540 
way down to the bottom but eventually it

00:01:25.540 --> 00:01:27.300 
way down to the bottom but eventually it
doesn't<00:01:25.870> really<00:01:25.990> matter<00:01:26.230> you<00:01:26.950> know<00:01:27.130> they're

00:01:27.300 --> 00:01:27.310 
doesn't really matter you know they're

00:01:27.310 --> 00:01:29.010 
doesn't really matter you know they're
not<00:01:27.460> exactly<00:01:27.700> the<00:01:28.180> hardest<00:01:28.540> to<00:01:28.630> take<00:01:28.780> out

00:01:29.010 --> 00:01:29.020 
not exactly the hardest to take out

00:01:29.020 --> 00:01:31.560 
not exactly the hardest to take out
you're<00:01:29.320> in<00:01:29.410> an<00:01:29.560> elevated<00:01:29.980> position<00:01:30.570> usually

00:01:31.560 --> 00:01:31.570 
you're in an elevated position usually

00:01:31.570 --> 00:01:34.020 
you're in an elevated position usually
it's<00:01:31.780> more<00:01:32.590> advantageous<00:01:32.710> for<00:01:33.550> you<00:01:33.700> to<00:01:33.790> stay

00:01:34.020 --> 00:01:34.030 
it's more advantageous for you to stay

00:01:34.030 --> 00:01:35.520 
it's more advantageous for you to stay
up<00:01:34.150> there<00:01:34.300> wait<00:01:34.540> till<00:01:34.720> it's<00:01:34.870> all<00:01:35.020> clear<00:01:35.350> and

00:01:35.520 --> 00:01:35.530 
up there wait till it's all clear and

00:01:35.530 --> 00:01:37.560 
up there wait till it's all clear and
then<00:01:35.950> start<00:01:36.370> advancing<00:01:36.850> down<00:01:37.060> it's<00:01:37.300> actually

00:01:37.560 --> 00:01:37.570 
then start advancing down it's actually

00:01:37.570 --> 00:01:39.350 
then start advancing down it's actually
a<00:01:37.600> guy<00:01:37.780> behind<00:01:37.990> me<00:01:38.380> which<00:01:38.530> I<00:01:38.680> have<00:01:38.800> to<00:01:38.920> kill

00:01:39.350 --> 00:01:39.360 
a guy behind me which I have to kill

00:02:53.710 --> 00:02:53.720

you want to head shots and this kind of
forces<00:02:56.360> you<00:02:56.480> because<00:02:56.870> if<00:02:57.080> you<00:02:57.200> do<00:02:57.440> not<00:02:57.620> use

forces you because if you do not use

00:02:58.010 --> 00:03:00.010 
forces you because if you do not use
head<00:02:58.250> shots<00:02:58.550> you're<00:02:59.090> likely<00:02:59.300> not<00:02:59.480> taking<00:02:59.960> them

00:03:00.010 --> 00:03:00.020 
head shots you're likely not taking them

00:03:00.020 --> 00:03:01.449 
head shots you're likely not taking them
down<00:03:00.230> then<00:03:00.560> he's<00:03:00.680> going<00:03:00.830> to<00:03:00.890> take<00:03:01.100> a<00:03:01.130> shotgun

00:03:01.449 --> 00:03:01.459 
down then he's going to take a shotgun

00:03:01.459 --> 00:03:04.210 
down then he's going to take a shotgun
and<00:03:01.760> split<00:03:02.240> in<00:03:02.450> half<00:03:02.780> so<00:03:03.709> make<00:03:03.890> sure<00:03:03.920> you

00:03:04.210 --> 00:03:04.220 
and split in half so make sure you

00:03:04.220 --> 00:03:06.430 
and split in half so make sure you
always<00:03:04.400> aim<00:03:04.670> for<00:03:04.700> the<00:03:04.970> head<00:03:05.090> it's<00:03:05.330> just<00:03:05.570> easier

00:03:06.430 --> 00:03:06.440 
always aim for the head it's just easier

00:03:06.440 --> 00:03:08.820 
always aim for the head it's just easier
to<00:03:06.560> do<00:03:06.709> that<00:03:06.920> every<00:03:07.250> single<00:03:07.430> step<00:03:07.730> the<00:03:08.000> way

00:03:08.820 --> 00:03:08.830 
to do that every single step the way

00:03:08.830 --> 00:03:10.420 
to do that every single step the way
then<00:03:09.830> you're<00:03:09.950> going<00:03:10.070> to<00:03:10.130> make<00:03:10.220> your<00:03:10.370> way

don't<00:05:18.940> want<00:05:19.150> that<00:05:19.240> there<00:05:19.690> you<00:05:19.780> go<00:05:19.900> so<00:05:20.080> I<00:05:20.110> think

00:05:20.189 --> 00:05:20.199 
don't want that there you go so I think

00:05:20.199 --> 00:05:21.510 
don't want that there you go so I think
that's<00:05:20.440> a<00:05:20.560> lost<00:05:20.740> guy<00:05:20.919> there<00:05:21.099> and<00:05:21.130> then<00:05:21.310> you<00:05:21.400> can

00:05:21.510 --> 00:05:21.520 
that's a lost guy there and then you can

00:05:21.520 --> 00:05:23.010 
that's a lost guy there and then you can
just<00:05:21.669> concentrate<00:05:22.060> on<00:05:22.330> getting<00:05:22.449> these<00:05:22.780> guys

00:05:23.010 --> 00:05:23.020 
just concentrate on getting these guys

00:05:23.020 --> 00:05:24.360 
just concentrate on getting these guys
close<00:05:23.289> up<00:05:23.470> if<00:05:23.650> you<00:05:23.740> have<00:05:23.860> an<00:05:24.010> assault<00:05:24.310> rifle

00:05:24.360 --> 00:05:24.370 
close up if you have an assault rifle

00:05:24.370 --> 00:05:27.000 
close up if you have an assault rifle
who<00:05:24.729> cares<00:05:25.030> I<00:05:25.510> mean<00:05:26.080> the<00:05:26.169> handgun<00:05:26.620> will<00:05:26.770> do<00:05:26.889> the

00:05:27.000 --> 00:05:27.010 
who cares I mean the handgun will do the

00:05:27.010 --> 00:05:29.159 
who cares I mean the handgun will do the
trick<00:05:27.130> as<00:05:27.310> well<00:05:27.490> I<00:05:27.729> just<00:05:28.000> like<00:05:28.360> it's<00:05:28.570> more<00:05:28.900> fun

00:05:29.159 --> 00:05:29.169 
trick as well I just like it's more fun

00:05:29.169 --> 00:05:31.409 
trick as well I just like it's more fun
when<00:05:29.199> you're<00:05:29.500> using<00:05:29.680> the<00:05:29.940> sniper<00:05:30.940> rifle

00:05:31.409 --> 00:05:31.419 
when you're using the sniper rifle

00:05:31.419 --> 00:05:33.450 
when you're using the sniper rifle
personally<00:05:31.930> I<00:05:32.199> think<00:05:32.680> that's<00:05:32.949> kind<00:05:33.159> of<00:05:33.190> fun

00:05:33.450 --> 00:05:33.460 
personally I think that's kind of fun

00:05:33.460 --> 00:05:36.510 
personally I think that's kind of fun
it's<00:05:34.449> one<00:05:34.690> hit<00:05:34.990> and<00:05:35.260> just<00:05:35.500> the<00:05:35.680> lamb<00:05:35.860> they're

00:05:36.510 --> 00:05:36.520 
it's one hit and just the lamb they're

00:05:36.520 --> 00:05:39.060 
it's one hit and just the lamb they're
down<00:05:36.870> so<00:05:37.870> once<00:05:38.050> you<00:05:38.169> have<00:05:38.199> them<00:05:38.470> all<00:05:38.650> cleared

00:05:39.060 --> 00:05:39.070 
down so once you have them all cleared

00:05:39.070 --> 00:05:41.279 
down so once you have them all cleared
then<00:05:39.580> you're<00:05:39.729> going<00:05:39.820> to<00:05:39.909> drop<00:05:40.120> down<00:05:40.389> and<00:05:40.930> these

00:05:41.279 --> 00:05:41.289 
then you're going to drop down and these

00:05:41.289 --> 00:05:43.200 
then you're going to drop down and these
I<00:05:41.349> don't<00:05:42.099> understand<00:05:42.520> I<00:05:42.610> mean<00:05:42.759> if<00:05:42.880> it's<00:05:43.000> really

00:05:43.200 --> 00:05:43.210 
I don't understand I mean if it's really

00:05:43.210 --> 00:05:45.060 
I don't understand I mean if it's really
wide<00:05:43.419> you<00:05:43.780> could<00:05:43.930> fall<00:05:44.110> off<00:05:44.289> these<00:05:44.650> thin<00:05:44.860> ones

00:05:45.060 --> 00:05:45.070 
wide you could fall off these thin ones

00:05:45.070 --> 00:05:47.010 
wide you could fall off these thin ones
you<00:05:45.220> can<00:05:45.340> sprint<00:05:45.759> across<00:05:46.030> like<00:05:46.389> there's<00:05:46.630> no

00:05:47.010 --> 00:05:47.020 
you can sprint across like there's no

00:05:47.020 --> 00:05:49.140 
you can sprint across like there's no
tomorrow<00:05:47.409> doesn't<00:05:48.310> really<00:05:48.400> make<00:05:48.610> sense<00:05:48.669> too

00:05:49.140 --> 00:05:49.150 
tomorrow doesn't really make sense too

00:05:49.150 --> 00:05:50.129 
tomorrow doesn't really make sense too
much<00:05:49.300> now<00:05:49.570> you're<00:05:49.720> going<00:05:49.840> to<00:05:49.900> be<00:05:49.990> making

00:05:50.129 --> 00:05:50.139 
much now you're going to be making

00:05:50.139 --> 00:05:51.420 
much now you're going to be making
across<00:05:50.530> the<00:05:50.650> bridge<00:05:50.830> here<00:05:51.070> it's<00:05:51.190> going<00:05:51.340> to

00:05:51.420 --> 00:05:51.430 
across the bridge here it's going to

00:05:51.430 --> 00:05:54.480 
across the bridge here it's going to
collapse<00:05:51.610> just<00:05:52.450> keep<00:05:52.690> jumping<00:05:53.260> climb<00:05:54.099> up<00:05:54.310> you

00:05:54.480 --> 00:05:54.490 
collapse just keep jumping climb up you

00:05:56.919 --> 00:05:56.929 
fall down jump John

00:05:56.929 --> 00:06:00.829 
fall down jump John
jump<00:05:57.929> and<00:05:58.259> then<00:05:58.529> it<00:05:58.709> collapses<00:05:59.429> so<00:06:00.300> just<00:06:00.599> make

00:06:00.829 --> 00:06:00.839 
jump and then it collapses so just make

00:06:00.839 --> 00:06:02.839 
jump and then it collapses so just make
your<00:06:01.020> way<00:06:01.199> up<00:06:01.379> here<00:06:01.679> obviously<00:06:02.279> you're<00:06:02.580> going

00:06:02.839 --> 00:06:02.849

00:06:04.159 --> 00:06:04.169 
to have to go to the sides just like

00:06:04.169 --> 00:06:05.749 
to have to go to the sides just like
anything<00:06:04.499> else<00:06:04.709> but<00:06:05.339> you<00:06:05.459> want<00:06:05.639> to<00:06:05.699> keep

00:06:07.850 --> 00:06:07.860 
moving because it is timed and it will

00:06:07.860 --> 00:06:09.709
