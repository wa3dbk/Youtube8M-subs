 hello everyone I hope you are very well 

00:00:03.120 --> 00:00:08.580
 let's start with a new video that 

00:00:05.709 --> 00:00:08.580
 it's about south 

00:00:11.460 --> 00:00:15.420
 and well let's start opening 

00:00:13.410 --> 00:00:17.760
 our photoshop we are going to come here 

00:00:15.420 --> 00:00:19.710
 open file we open the image that 

00:00:17.760 --> 00:00:21.960
 we wish and good friends we are already 

00:00:19.710 --> 00:00:24.450
 back for this effect we should 

00:00:21.960 --> 00:00:27.390
 need an image that is blank 

00:00:24.450 --> 00:00:30.810
 and black you can apply the effect 

00:00:27.390 --> 00:00:32.369
 that you want the kind of white and 

00:00:30.810 --> 00:00:34.230
 black that you use to 

00:00:32.369 --> 00:00:37.920
 any occasion 

00:00:34.230 --> 00:00:41.850
 it's to your taste in case you do not have any 

00:00:37.920 --> 00:00:44.640
 black and white effect then go to my 

00:00:41.850 --> 00:00:46.620
 channel I have one and I will also leave you 

00:00:44.640 --> 00:00:49.530
 the link here below in the description 

00:00:46.620 --> 00:00:52.559
 in case someone wants to use it good 

00:00:49.530 --> 00:00:55.920
 friends what we are going to do is duplicate 

00:00:52.559 --> 00:00:58.769
 the background layer with control j 

00:00:55.920 --> 00:01:01.129
 since we have duplicated the layer 

00:00:58.769 --> 00:01:05.600
 to click and we will come here image 

00:01:01.129 --> 00:01:09.290
 adjustments and color balance 

00:01:05.600 --> 00:01:13.420
 what we are going to do here is that 

00:01:09.290 --> 00:01:16.710
 yellow we're going to put it in less 

00:01:13.420 --> 00:01:16.710
 at least 50 

00:01:17.520 --> 00:01:24.960
 in the sea in the magenta we are going to put 

00:01:21.060 --> 00:01:27.900
 to a -25 

00:01:24.960 --> 00:01:31.229
 and at 100 we will put it in a number 

00:01:27.900 --> 00:01:33.560
 10 good friends this without halftones 

00:01:31.229 --> 00:01:36.170
 let's give ok 

00:01:33.560 --> 00:01:38.000
 and good as we have this what 

00:01:36.170 --> 00:01:40.100
 let's do is click on layer 1 

00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:44.030
 click to the background layer with control 

00:01:40.100 --> 00:01:48.020
 sustained and we are going to join it pressing 

00:01:44.030 --> 00:01:50.409
 control now we're going to duplicate another 

00:01:48.020 --> 00:01:54.569
 time with control j 

00:01:50.409 --> 00:01:57.170
 and we are going to come the picture adjustments and 

00:01:54.569 --> 00:02:00.380
 photography filters 

00:01:57.170 --> 00:02:02.689
 this photography filter we are going to ask 

00:02:00.380 --> 00:02:05.509
 here to filter in case they have the color 

00:02:02.689 --> 00:02:08.090
 let's write filter and we give a 

00:02:05.509 --> 00:02:11.150
 hot filter 85 I think this is 

00:02:08.090 --> 00:02:13.160
 the default that is good the 

00:02:11.150 --> 00:02:16.370
 density we're going to leave it at 25 

00:02:13.160 --> 00:02:18.950
 percent and we're going to give what the 

00:02:16.370 --> 00:02:22.380
 we must do now is change the mode 

00:02:18.950 --> 00:02:24.540
 depending on this layer to soft light 

00:02:22.380 --> 00:02:27.600
 As you can see, they have already changed 

00:02:24.540 --> 00:02:28.770
 different tones now we are going to lower it 

00:02:27.600 --> 00:02:31.650
 the opacity 

00:02:28.770 --> 00:02:33.420
 at 75% 

00:02:31.650 --> 00:02:35.760
 the adherents 

00:02:33.420 --> 00:02:38.069
 and let's click on the eye to see 

00:02:35.760 --> 00:02:40.200
 the before and the after 

00:02:38.069 --> 00:02:42.959
 now what we should make friends is what 

00:02:40.200 --> 00:02:45.150
 same is again select this layer 

00:02:42.959 --> 00:02:47.670
 and with sustained control of the other 

00:02:45.150 --> 00:02:50.609
 by clicking on it and we are going to press control 

00:02:47.670 --> 00:02:54.019
 and now what we must do to 

00:02:50.609 --> 00:02:58.020
 finalize this tutorial is with the magnifying glass 

00:02:54.019 --> 00:03:00.840
 come a little closer to the eyes 

00:02:58.020 --> 00:03:03.610
 as you know we are going to choose the tool 

00:03:00.840 --> 00:03:08.220
 it's about exposing 

00:03:03.610 --> 00:03:10.800
 and let's click on the eye 

00:03:08.220 --> 00:03:15.090
 or in the eyes depends on your image 

00:03:10.800 --> 00:03:18.480
 well this is to add another color 

00:03:15.090 --> 00:03:20.900
 to our eye not to add another color but 

00:03:18.480 --> 00:03:23.310
 that change the color to a little lighter 

00:03:20.900 --> 00:03:26.640
 this what it does is that about exposes 

00:03:23.310 --> 00:03:28.490
 color and how can you see that way 

00:03:26.640 --> 00:03:31.250
 The effect 

00:03:28.490 --> 00:03:33.740
