with<00:00:12.360> wiring<00:00:14.089> wall<00:00:15.089> pots<00:00:15.420> have<00:00:16.340> three<00:00:17.340> lugs

00:00:17.630 --> 00:00:17.640 
with wiring wall pots have three lugs

00:00:17.640 --> 00:00:21.650 
with wiring wall pots have three lugs
that<00:00:17.940> you<00:00:18.390> wire<00:00:19.080> to<00:00:19.550> now<00:00:20.550> something<00:00:21.539> that

00:00:21.650 --> 00:00:21.660 
that you wire to now something that

00:00:21.660 --> 00:00:25.519 
that you wire to now something that
often<00:00:21.810> happens<00:00:21.990> when<00:00:22.710> you<00:00:22.949> install<00:00:23.430> it<00:00:23.640> and<00:00:24.529> if

00:00:25.519 --> 00:00:25.529 
often happens when you install it and if

00:00:25.529 --> 00:00:27.439 
often happens when you install it and if
you<00:00:25.710> have<00:00:26.279> a<00:00:26.310> class<00:00:26.580> guitar<00:00:26.970> or<00:00:27.150> something

00:00:27.439 --> 00:00:27.449 
you have a class guitar or something

00:00:27.449 --> 00:00:31.640 
you have a class guitar or something
without<00:00:27.570> a<00:00:27.720> thin<00:00:27.990> top<00:00:29.539> it<00:00:30.539> is<00:00:30.689> very<00:00:30.929> likely<00:00:31.230> or

00:00:31.640 --> 00:00:31.650 
without a thin top it is very likely or

00:00:31.650 --> 00:00:34.660 
without a thin top it is very likely or
possible<00:00:32.250> to<00:00:33.000> short<00:00:33.780> these<00:00:34.079> three<00:00:34.469> off

00:00:34.660 --> 00:00:34.670 
possible to short these three off

00:00:34.670 --> 00:00:38.090 
possible to short these three off
against<00:00:35.670> the<00:00:35.790> shielding<00:00:36.180> and<00:00:37.140> that<00:00:37.380> is<00:00:37.770> a<00:00:37.829> bad

00:00:38.090 --> 00:00:38.100 
against the shielding and that is a bad

00:00:38.100 --> 00:00:40.100 
against the shielding and that is a bad
thing<00:00:38.309> because<00:00:38.489> it<00:00:38.670> yeah<00:00:39.329> stops<00:00:39.660> your<00:00:39.809> guitar

00:00:40.100 --> 00:00:40.110 
thing because it yeah stops your guitar

00:00:40.110 --> 00:00:43.459 
thing because it yeah stops your guitar
working<00:00:40.489> now<00:00:41.489> most<00:00:42.239> pots<00:00:42.600> most<00:00:42.989> times<00:00:43.290> you

00:00:43.459 --> 00:00:43.469 
working now most pots most times you

00:00:43.469 --> 00:00:45.650 
working now most pots most times you
will<00:00:43.680> if<00:00:44.010> you've<00:00:44.219> got<00:00:44.399> the<00:00:44.520> room<00:00:44.730> put<00:00:45.270> a<00:00:45.300> nut

00:00:45.650 --> 00:00:45.660 
will if you've got the room put a nut

00:00:45.660 --> 00:00:50.150 
will if you've got the room put a nut
there<00:00:46.200> which<00:00:47.070> will<00:00:47.430> keep<00:00:48.030> that<00:00:48.210> away<00:00:48.620> but<00:00:49.620> what

00:00:50.150 --> 00:00:50.160 
there which will keep that away but what

00:00:50.160 --> 00:00:52.610 
there which will keep that away but what
we<00:00:50.340> have<00:00:50.520> to<00:00:50.550> do<00:00:50.850> on<00:00:51.270> a<00:00:51.329> carved<00:00:51.809> guitar<00:00:52.199> that

00:00:52.610 --> 00:00:52.620 
we have to do on a carved guitar that

00:00:52.620 --> 00:00:55.060 
we have to do on a carved guitar that
still<00:00:52.890> has<00:00:53.070> a<00:00:53.100> relatively<00:00:53.520> thick<00:00:53.789> top<00:00:54.120> is

00:00:55.060 --> 00:00:55.070 
still has a relatively thick top is

00:00:55.070 --> 00:00:57.200 
still has a relatively thick top is
shielded<00:00:56.070> off<00:00:56.160> with<00:00:56.430> a<00:00:56.460> bit<00:00:56.640> of<00:00:56.699> plastic<00:00:57.000> you

00:00:57.200 --> 00:00:57.210 
shielded off with a bit of plastic you

00:00:57.210 --> 00:00:59.540 
shielded off with a bit of plastic you
can<00:00:57.690> use<00:00:58.109> electricians<00:00:58.980> tape<00:00:59.129> or<00:00:59.309> something

00:00:59.540 --> 00:00:59.550 
can use electricians tape or something

00:00:59.550 --> 00:01:03.740 
can use electricians tape or something
like<00:00:59.640> that<00:00:59.699> that<00:01:00.300> over<00:01:01.140> time<00:01:01.640> the<00:01:02.640> bits<00:01:03.629> of

00:01:03.740 --> 00:01:03.750 
like that that over time the bits of

00:01:03.750 --> 00:01:05.840 
like that that over time the bits of
metal<00:01:03.870> can<00:01:04.229> push<00:01:04.500> through<00:01:04.769> and<00:01:05.159> then<00:01:05.549> shorter

00:01:05.840 --> 00:01:05.850 
metal can push through and then shorter

00:01:05.850 --> 00:01:09.560 
metal can push through and then shorter

00:01:57.399 --> 00:01:57.409 
this and you wire up something like one

00:01:57.409 --> 00:01:58.690 
this and you wire up something like one
of<00:01:57.500> our<00:01:57.590> rubber<00:01:57.770> foot<00:01:57.950> guitars<00:01:58.310> with<00:01:58.460> all<00:01:58.580> the

MIDI and Fernandez sustainer and stuff

00:02:01.130 --> 00:02:02.710 
MIDI and Fernandez sustainer and stuff
and<00:02:01.430> then<00:02:01.729> have<00:02:01.939> to<00:02:02.060> take<00:02:02.210> everything<00:02:02.539> out

00:02:02.710 --> 00:02:02.720 
and then have to take everything out

00:02:02.720 --> 00:02:05.740 
and then have to take everything out
again<00:02:02.930> faults<00:02:03.860> find<00:02:04.189> and<00:02:04.570> it's<00:02:05.570> something

00:02:05.740 --> 00:02:05.750 
again faults find and it's something

00:02:05.750 --> 00:02:09.009 
again faults find and it's something
that's<00:02:05.960> simple<00:02:06.409> you<00:02:06.560> will<00:02:06.800> kick<00:02:06.979> yourself
