00:03:26.080 --> 00:03:26.090 
still have quite a bit of production

00:03:26.090 --> 00:03:29.410 
still have quite a bit of production
left<00:03:26.299> so<00:03:27.139> we<00:03:27.349> will<00:03:27.530> start<00:03:27.950> some<00:03:28.430> transport

00:03:29.410 --> 00:03:29.420 
left so we will start some transport

00:03:37.229 --> 00:03:37.239 
expensive now remember them being we're

00:03:37.239 --> 00:03:40.020 
expensive now remember them being we're
going<00:03:37.360> to<00:03:37.450> hold<00:03:37.629> off<00:03:37.750> on<00:03:37.810> those<00:03:38.730> for<00:03:39.730> the<00:03:39.790> Navy

initial carrier I don't plan on building

00:04:11.250 --> 00:04:16.050 
initial carrier I don't plan on building
many<00:04:12.250> carriers<00:04:12.790> but<00:04:13.860> shall<00:04:14.860> do<00:04:15.099> two<00:04:15.549> carriers

00:04:16.050 --> 00:04:16.060 
many carriers but shall do two carriers

00:04:16.060 --> 00:04:19.080 
many carriers but shall do two carriers
here<00:04:16.680> it's<00:04:17.680> important<00:04:18.280> to<00:04:18.519> start<00:04:18.700> the<00:04:18.880> Navy

00:04:19.080 --> 00:04:19.090 
here it's important to start the Navy

00:04:19.090 --> 00:04:21.900 
here it's important to start the Navy
early<00:04:19.510> because<00:04:19.870> you<00:04:20.859> need<00:04:21.040> to<00:04:21.190> warm<00:04:21.609> up<00:04:21.760> your

00:04:21.900 --> 00:04:21.910 
early because you need to warm up your

00:04:21.910 --> 00:04:23.640 
early because you need to warm up your
practicals<00:04:22.539> otherwise<00:04:22.960> it<00:04:23.200> will<00:04:23.260> take<00:04:23.470> too

00:04:23.640 --> 00:04:23.650 
practicals otherwise it will take too

00:04:23.650 --> 00:04:25.230 
practicals otherwise it will take too
long<00:04:23.830> to<00:04:23.889> build<00:04:24.190> the<00:04:24.370> more<00:04:24.550> advanced<00:04:24.789> models

00:04:25.230 --> 00:04:25.240 
long to build the more advanced models

00:04:25.240 --> 00:04:29.219 
long to build the more advanced models
anyways<00:04:26.010> okay<00:04:27.010> with<00:04:27.340> that<00:04:27.520> said<00:04:28.110> looks<00:04:29.110> like

00:04:29.219 --> 00:04:29.229 
anyways okay with that said looks like

00:04:29.229 --> 00:04:30.750 
anyways okay with that said looks like
we'll<00:04:29.380> have<00:04:29.410> it<00:04:29.710> one<00:04:29.889> pocket<00:04:30.310> battleship

00:04:30.750 --> 00:04:30.760 
we'll have it one pocket battleship

00:04:30.760 --> 00:04:34.290 
we'll have it one pocket battleship

to set it at 1.5 the bulk of my officers
will<00:05:12.639> be<00:05:12.669> deployed<00:05:13.510> later<00:05:15.270> not<00:05:16.270> now<00:05:16.300> and

00:05:17.210 --> 00:05:17.220 
will be deployed later not now and

00:05:17.220 --> 00:05:19.230
