straight<00:02:26.000> and<00:02:26.209> curled<00:02:26.870> and<00:02:27.140> it<00:02:27.890> didn't<00:02:28.160> hold

00:02:28.270 --> 00:02:28.280 
straight and curled and it didn't hold

00:02:28.280 --> 00:02:29.740 
straight and curled and it didn't hold
the<00:02:28.430> curl<00:02:28.700> for<00:02:28.910> a<00:02:28.970> long<00:02:29.150> time

00:02:29.740 --> 00:02:29.750 
the curl for a long time

00:02:29.750 --> 00:02:31.630 
the curl for a long time
basically<00:02:30.380> it<00:02:30.740> held<00:02:31.040> the<00:02:31.160> curl<00:02:31.370> under

00:02:31.630 --> 00:02:31.640 
basically it held the curl under

00:02:31.640 --> 00:02:33.640 
basically it held the curl under
straighten<00:02:31.880> until<00:02:32.360> I<00:02:32.390> watched<00:02:32.810> it<00:02:33.020> which<00:02:33.500> was

00:02:33.640 --> 00:02:33.650 
straighten until I watched it which was

00:02:33.650 --> 00:02:36.310 
straighten until I watched it which was
this<00:02:33.890> morning<00:02:34.370> and<00:02:34.580> that<00:02:35.540> was<00:02:35.660> a<00:02:35.690> long<00:02:35.990> period

00:02:36.310 --> 00:02:36.320 
this morning and that was a long period

00:02:36.320 --> 00:02:38.410 
this morning and that was a long period
of<00:02:36.350> time<00:02:36.530> so<00:02:37.010> it<00:02:37.370> does<00:02:37.550> straighten<00:02:37.970> well<00:02:38.120> but

00:02:38.410 --> 00:02:38.420 
of time so it does straighten well but

00:02:38.420 --> 00:02:40.750 
of time so it does straighten well but
if<00:02:39.320> you<00:02:39.470> have<00:02:39.620> four<00:02:39.860> bundles<00:02:40.100> I<00:02:40.400> would<00:02:40.610> say

if you have four bundles I would say

00:02:40.760 --> 00:02:41.920

when you straighten it it's gonna be
really<00:02:42.230> thick<00:02:42.590> because<00:02:42.830> this<00:02:43.100> is<00:02:43.250> not<00:02:43.520> thin

00:02:43.810 --> 00:02:43.820
