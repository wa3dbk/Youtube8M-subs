controller<00:00:35.130> as<00:00:36.000> you<00:00:36.090> can<00:00:36.149> see<00:00:36.300> it's<00:00:36.390> got<00:00:36.480> some

00:00:36.620 --> 00:00:36.630 
controller as you can see it's got some

00:00:36.630 --> 00:00:37.910 
controller as you can see it's got some
pretty<00:00:36.750> nice<00:00:36.899> grip<00:00:37.200> on<00:00:37.320> the<00:00:37.410> sign<00:00:37.620> that's<00:00:37.770> one

00:00:37.910 --> 00:00:37.920 
pretty nice grip on the sign that's one

00:00:37.920 --> 00:00:39.319 
pretty nice grip on the sign that's one
thing<00:00:38.129> that<00:00:38.190> we<00:00:38.460> kind<00:00:38.730> of<00:00:38.820> really<00:00:39.030> like<00:00:39.120> what

00:00:39.319 --> 00:00:39.329 
thing that we kind of really like what

00:00:39.329 --> 00:00:40.729 
thing that we kind of really like what
this<00:00:39.420> controller<00:00:39.809> actually<00:00:40.020> it's<00:00:40.379> actually

00:00:40.729 --> 00:00:40.739 
this controller actually it's actually

00:00:40.739 --> 00:00:43.400 
this controller actually it's actually
really<00:00:40.890> soft<00:00:41.219> feeling<00:00:41.760> as<00:00:41.879> well<00:00:42.110> you<00:00:43.110> can<00:00:43.260> see

00:00:43.400 --> 00:00:43.410 
really soft feeling as well you can see

00:00:43.410 --> 00:00:45.950 
really soft feeling as well you can see
from<00:00:43.530> the<00:00:43.680> side<00:00:43.860> there<00:00:44.280> just<00:00:45.210> it's<00:00:45.450> got<00:00:45.600> lights

00:00:45.950 --> 00:00:45.960 
from the side there just it's got lights

00:00:45.960 --> 00:00:48.500 
from the side there just it's got lights
it's<00:00:46.920> got<00:00:47.039> a<00:00:47.070> really<00:00:47.309> nice<00:00:47.700> long<00:00:48.030> cord<00:00:48.390> that

you<00:00:48.570> can<00:00:48.690> plug<00:00:48.870> in<00:00:49.050> so<00:00:49.170> you<00:00:49.260> don't<00:00:49.379> have<00:00:49.440> to<00:00:49.559> use

00:00:49.639 --> 00:00:49.649 
you can plug in so you don't have to use

00:00:49.649 --> 00:00:51.470 
you can plug in so you don't have to use
batteries<00:00:50.129> now<00:00:50.700> we're<00:00:50.910> coming<00:00:51.030> up<00:00:51.300> on<00:00:51.420> the

00:00:51.470 --> 00:00:51.480 
batteries now we're coming up on the

00:00:51.480 --> 00:00:52.819 
batteries now we're coming up on the
back<00:00:51.690> of<00:00:51.719> the<00:00:51.930> controller<00:00:52.289> now<00:00:52.440> this<00:00:52.590> is<00:00:52.710> the

00:00:52.819 --> 00:00:52.829 
back of the controller now this is the

00:00:52.829 --> 00:00:54.500 
back of the controller now this is the
interesting<00:00:53.010> part<00:00:53.190> where<00:00:53.460> you<00:00:53.550> can<00:00:53.699> map<00:00:53.910> the

00:00:54.500 --> 00:00:54.510 
interesting part where you can map the

00:00:54.510 --> 00:00:56.029 
interesting part where you can map the
actual<00:00:54.809> buttons<00:00:55.140> so<00:00:55.379> if<00:00:55.440> you<00:00:55.559> want<00:00:55.739> to<00:00:55.829> jump

00:00:58.069 --> 00:00:58.079 
with your back button you just map it to

00:00:58.079 --> 00:01:01.250 
with your back button you just map it to
a<00:00:58.199> on<00:00:58.770> the<00:00:59.399> right<00:00:59.850> side<00:01:00.090> there<00:01:00.329> and<00:01:00.600> next<00:01:00.960> is

00:01:01.250 --> 00:01:01.260 
a on the right side there and next is

00:01:13.219 --> 00:01:13.229 
a shot of the triggers and the triggers

00:01:13.229 --> 00:01:14.750 
a shot of the triggers and the triggers
are<00:01:13.320> pretty<00:01:13.500> nice<00:01:13.619> feeling<00:01:14.070> I<00:01:14.220> still<00:01:14.549> would

00:01:14.750 --> 00:01:14.760 
are pretty nice feeling I still would

00:01:14.760 --> 00:01:16.730 
are pretty nice feeling I still would
prefer<00:01:15.060> the<00:01:15.240> original<00:01:15.720> Xbox<00:01:16.470> wired

00:01:16.730 --> 00:01:16.740 
prefer the original Xbox wired

00:01:16.740 --> 00:01:19.010 
prefer the original Xbox wired
controller<00:01:17.220> but<00:01:17.850> the<00:01:18.240> triggers<00:01:18.570> do<00:01:18.750> you<00:01:18.810> still

00:01:19.010 --> 00:01:19.020 
controller but the triggers do you still

00:01:19.020 --> 00:01:21.620 
controller but the triggers do you still
work<00:01:19.170> pretty<00:01:19.409> nicely<00:01:19.650> and<00:01:20.100> the<00:01:20.850> next<00:01:21.030> off<00:01:21.299> I'm

00:01:21.620 --> 00:01:21.630 
work pretty nicely and the next off I'm

00:01:21.630 --> 00:01:23.899 
work pretty nicely and the next off I'm
just<00:01:21.869> showcasing<00:01:22.409> the<00:01:22.890> LED<00:01:23.220> lights<00:01:23.460> was<00:01:23.700> kind

00:01:23.899 --> 00:01:23.909 
just showcasing the LED lights was kind

00:01:23.909 --> 00:01:26.539 
just showcasing the LED lights was kind
of<00:01:23.939> like<00:01:24.030> the<00:01:24.180> design<00:01:24.900> of<00:01:25.350> the<00:01:26.040> controller<00:01:26.430> I

00:01:26.539 --> 00:01:26.549 
of like the design of the controller I

00:01:26.549 --> 00:01:28.580 
of like the design of the controller I
guess<00:01:26.820> you<00:01:27.000> could<00:01:27.150> say<00:01:27.360> it's<00:01:27.390> got<00:01:27.840> it's<00:01:28.439> got<00:01:28.560> a

00:01:28.580 --> 00:01:28.590 
guess you could say it's got it's got a

00:01:28.590 --> 00:01:30.080 
guess you could say it's got it's got a
cool<00:01:28.770> design<00:01:28.890> like<00:01:29.250> it<00:01:29.369> looks<00:01:29.520> a<00:01:29.610> tiny<00:01:29.790> sooner

00:01:30.080 --> 00:01:30.090 
cool design like it looks a tiny sooner

00:01:30.090 --> 00:01:32.690 
cool design like it looks a tiny sooner
than<00:01:30.210> me<00:01:30.360> except<00:01:31.229> for<00:01:31.259> the<00:01:31.380> middle<00:01:31.650> button<00:01:31.829> and

00:01:32.690 --> 00:01:32.700 
than me except for the middle button and

00:01:32.700 --> 00:01:34.700 
than me except for the middle button and
uh<00:01:32.850> there's<00:01:33.570> one<00:01:33.750> more<00:01:33.869> shot<00:01:34.140> you<00:01:34.439> can<00:01:34.590> only

00:01:34.700 --> 00:01:34.710 
uh there's one more shot you can only

00:01:34.710 --> 00:01:36.200 
uh there's one more shot you can only
see<00:01:34.979> a<00:01:35.009> glowing<00:01:35.310> just<00:01:35.579> because<00:01:35.790> this<00:01:35.909> isn't

00:01:36.200 --> 00:01:36.210 
see a glowing just because this isn't

see a glowing just because this isn't
the<00:01:36.270> light<00:01:36.450> but<00:01:36.780> at<00:01:37.049> nighttime<00:01:37.560> it<00:01:38.009> does<00:01:38.220> the

00:01:38.630 --> 00:01:38.640 
the light but at nighttime it does the

the light but at nighttime it does the
60<00:01:39.060> globe<00:01:39.390> very<00:01:39.659> very<00:01:39.960> nicely<00:01:40.229> and<00:01:40.880> I<00:01:41.880> don't

00:01:42.560 --> 00:01:42.570

60 globe very very nicely and I don't
know<00:01:42.659> I<00:01:42.689> like<00:01:43.290> this<00:01:43.409> controller<00:01:43.829> it'd<00:01:44.130> be<00:01:44.310> good

00:01:44.480 --> 00:01:44.490 
know I like this controller it'd be good

00:01:44.490 --> 00:01:46.490 
know I like this controller it'd be good
if<00:01:44.549> I<00:01:44.850> wasn't<00:01:44.880> mean<00:01:45.420> to<00:01:45.450> competitive<00:01:46.140> too<00:01:46.290> much

00:01:46.490 --> 00:01:46.500 
if I wasn't mean to competitive too much

00:01:46.500 --> 00:01:49.130 
if I wasn't mean to competitive too much
but<00:01:46.799> for<00:01:47.430> a<00:01:47.460> pub<00:01:47.790> controller<00:01:48.240> he<00:01:48.600> does<00:01:48.720> not<00:01:48.930> go

00:01:49.130 --> 00:01:49.140 
but for a pub controller he does not go

00:01:49.140 --> 00:01:51.080 
but for a pub controller he does not go
around<00:01:49.290> corners<00:01:49.770> and<00:01:50.220> doing<00:01:50.430> stuff<00:01:50.610> for<00:01:50.670> GB

00:01:51.080 --> 00:01:51.090 
around corners and doing stuff for GB

00:01:51.090 --> 00:01:53.270 
around corners and doing stuff for GB
maybe<00:01:51.360> on<00:01:51.540> the<00:01:51.659> Xbox<00:01:52.140> it's<00:01:52.320> pretty<00:01:52.530> good<00:01:52.710> and

00:01:53.270 --> 00:01:53.280 
maybe on the Xbox it's pretty good and

00:01:53.280 --> 00:01:55.880 
maybe on the Xbox it's pretty good and
as<00:01:53.610> you<00:01:53.729> can<00:01:53.850> see<00:01:53.880> right<00:01:54.030> here<00:01:54.500> it's<00:01:55.500> just<00:01:55.740> like

00:01:55.880 --> 00:01:55.890 
as you can see right here it's just like

00:01:55.890 --> 00:01:57.380 
as you can see right here it's just like
a<00:01:55.920> normal<00:01:56.100> xbox<00:01:56.460> controller<00:01:56.909> it's<00:01:57.119> not<00:01:57.240> like<00:01:57.360> a

00:01:57.380 --> 00:01:57.390 
a normal xbox controller it's not like a

00:01:57.390 --> 00:01:59.510 
a normal xbox controller it's not like a
different<00:01:57.810> size<00:01:57.990> it's<00:01:58.500> pretty<00:01:59.009> much<00:01:59.100> the<00:01:59.159> same

00:01:59.510 --> 00:01:59.520 
different size it's pretty much the same

00:01:59.520 --> 00:02:01.609 
different size it's pretty much the same
everything<00:02:00.450> works<00:02:00.659> pretty<00:02:00.869> good<00:02:00.990> there's<00:02:01.409> the

00:02:01.609 --> 00:02:01.619 
everything works pretty good there's the

00:02:01.619 --> 00:02:03.709 
everything works pretty good there's the
two<00:02:02.280> back<00:02:02.490> things<00:02:02.790> where<00:02:02.969> you<00:02:03.090> can<00:02:03.240> map<00:02:03.509> out

00:02:03.709 --> 00:02:03.719 
two back things where you can map out

00:02:03.719 --> 00:02:06.350 
two back things where you can map out
your<00:02:03.780> buttons<00:02:04.530> and<00:02:04.740> whatnot<00:02:05.070> and<00:02:05.369> that<00:02:06.119> really

00:02:06.350 --> 00:02:06.360 
your buttons and whatnot and that really

00:02:06.360 --> 00:02:08.389 
your buttons and whatnot and that really
works<00:02:06.630> so<00:02:06.960> alright<00:02:07.619> so<00:02:07.829> from

00:02:08.389 --> 00:02:08.399 
works so alright so from

00:02:08.399 --> 00:02:10.279 
works so alright so from
spective<00:02:08.729> is<00:02:08.819> a<00:02:08.849> casual<00:02:09.360> gamer<00:02:09.599> i<00:02:09.720> think<00:02:10.170> this

00:02:10.279 --> 00:02:10.289 
spective is a casual gamer i think this

00:02:10.289 --> 00:02:12.830 
spective is a casual gamer i think this
controller<00:02:10.739> pretty<00:02:11.250> cool<00:02:11.519> it's<00:02:11.939> like<00:02:12.510> i<00:02:12.540> said

00:02:12.830 --> 00:02:12.840 
controller pretty cool it's like i said

00:02:12.840 --> 00:02:14.780 
controller pretty cool it's like i said
very<00:02:13.049> similar<00:02:13.439> to<00:02:13.470> the<00:02:13.620> xbox<00:02:14.099> 360<00:02:14.760> controller

00:02:14.780 --> 00:02:14.790 
very similar to the xbox 360 controller

00:02:14.790 --> 00:02:18.399 
very similar to the xbox 360 controller
so<00:02:15.480> it's<00:02:15.629> easy<00:02:15.870> adjustment<00:02:16.470> offer<00:02:17.250> some<00:02:17.730> cool

00:02:18.399 --> 00:02:18.409 
so it's easy adjustment offer some cool

00:02:18.409 --> 00:02:20.509 
so it's easy adjustment offer some cool
buttons<00:02:19.409> and<00:02:19.739> stuff<00:02:19.890> on<00:02:20.040> the<00:02:20.129> back<00:02:20.280> where<00:02:20.459> you

00:02:20.509 --> 00:02:20.519 
buttons and stuff on the back where you

00:02:20.519 --> 00:02:23.030 
buttons and stuff on the back where you
can<00:02:20.610> mix<00:02:20.790> up<00:02:21.030> your<00:02:21.060> leo<00:02:21.510> and<00:02:21.989> just<00:02:22.590> see<00:02:23.010> how

00:02:23.030 --> 00:02:23.040 
can mix up your leo and just see how

00:02:23.040 --> 00:02:25.160 
can mix up your leo and just see how
that<00:02:23.310> works<00:02:23.430> out<00:02:23.640> for<00:02:23.819> you<00:02:23.970> for<00:02:24.599> only<00:02:24.659> thirty

00:02:25.160 --> 00:02:25.170 
that works out for you for only thirty

00:02:25.170 --> 00:02:26.660 
that works out for you for only thirty
five<00:02:25.379> dollars<00:02:25.709> I<00:02:25.829> think<00:02:26.010> it's<00:02:26.099> a<00:02:26.220> pretty<00:02:26.430> good

00:02:26.660 --> 00:02:26.670 
five dollars I think it's a pretty good

00:02:26.670 --> 00:02:28.880 
five dollars I think it's a pretty good
buy<00:02:26.849> for<00:02:26.879> a<00:02:27.239> while<00:02:27.390> wired<00:02:28.079> controller<00:02:28.650> it's

pretty durable and yeah I recommend
picking<00:02:33.060> one<00:02:33.329> up<00:02:33.480> but<00:02:33.930> other<00:02:34.260> than<00:02:34.470> that<00:02:34.530> I

now<00:02:42.510> four<00:02:42.900> competitors<00:02:43.049> plenty<00:02:43.980> MLG<00:02:44.430> and

00:02:44.539 --> 00:02:44.549

now four competitors plenty MLG and
stuff<00:02:44.790> I<00:02:45.030> would<00:02:45.389> not<00:02:45.569> really<00:02:45.900> recommend<00:02:46.319> this

00:02:46.369 --> 00:02:46.379 
stuff I would not really recommend this

00:02:46.379 --> 00:02:49.129 
stuff I would not really recommend this
controller<00:02:46.739> because<00:02:47.040> at<00:02:47.549> MLG<00:02:47.849> events<00:02:48.359> or<00:02:48.540> most

00:02:49.129 --> 00:02:49.139 
controller because at MLG events or most

00:02:49.139 --> 00:02:50.780 
controller because at MLG events or most
lads<00:02:49.500> you<00:02:49.980> cannot<00:02:50.190> use<00:02:50.400> something<00:02:50.639> with

00:02:50.780 --> 00:02:50.790 
lads you cannot use something with

00:02:50.790 --> 00:02:53.569 
lads you cannot use something with
controller<00:02:51.209> mapping<00:02:51.629> on<00:02:51.720> the<00:02:51.840> back<00:02:51.989> now<00:02:52.739> this

00:02:53.569 --> 00:02:53.579 
controller mapping on the back now this

00:02:53.579 --> 00:02:54.949 
controller mapping on the back now this
kind<00:02:53.819> of<00:02:53.879> makes<00:02:53.970> it<00:02:54.090> difficult<00:02:54.299> for<00:02:54.689> people<00:02:54.930> to

00:02:54.949 --> 00:02:54.959 
kind of makes it difficult for people to

00:02:54.959 --> 00:02:56.119 
kind of makes it difficult for people to
like<00:02:55.109> get<00:02:55.290> used<00:02:55.470> to<00:02:55.560> the<00:02:55.620> controller<00:02:55.950> like

00:02:56.119 --> 00:02:56.129 
like get used to the controller like

00:02:56.129 --> 00:02:58.129 
like get used to the controller like
this<00:02:56.340> when<00:02:57.060> you<00:02:57.209> can't<00:02:57.450> really<00:02:57.569> use<00:02:57.840> if<00:02:58.019> you

00:02:58.129 --> 00:02:58.139 
this when you can't really use if you

00:02:58.139 --> 00:02:59.990 
this when you can't really use if you
can<00:02:58.290> compete<00:02:58.620> so<00:02:58.859> personally<00:02:59.430> I<00:02:59.489> would<00:02:59.819> be

00:02:59.990 --> 00:03:00.000 
can compete so personally I would be

00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:03.020 
can compete so personally I would be
using<00:03:00.120> this<00:03:00.329> but<00:03:01.019> um<00:03:01.370> yeah<00:03:02.370> other<00:03:02.519> than<00:03:02.609> that<00:03:02.730> I

00:03:03.020 --> 00:03:03.030 
using this but um yeah other than that I

00:03:03.030 --> 00:03:04.640 
using this but um yeah other than that I
select<00:03:03.420> the<00:03:03.510> way<00:03:03.629> to<00:03:03.689> controller<00:03:04.049> feels<00:03:04.379> I

00:03:04.640 --> 00:03:04.650 
select the way to controller feels I

00:03:04.650 --> 00:03:06.199 
select the way to controller feels I
think<00:03:04.709> it's<00:03:04.980> pretty<00:03:05.099> great<00:03:05.370> and<00:03:05.639> I<00:03:06.180> really

like<00:03:06.599> the<00:03:06.780> building<00:03:07.769> of<00:03:07.889> it<00:03:08.069> better<00:03:08.459> than<00:03:08.639> any

00:03:08.720 --> 00:03:08.730 
like the building of it better than any

00:03:08.730 --> 00:03:10.460 
like the building of it better than any
mad<00:03:08.939> catz<00:03:09.239> control<00:03:09.540> I've<00:03:09.659> ever<00:03:09.810> seen<00:03:10.049> so
