many<00:03:19.220> people<00:03:19.670> just<00:03:20.290> so<00:03:21.290> they<00:03:21.320> didn't<00:03:21.590> have

00:03:21.670 --> 00:03:21.680

00:04:59.210 --> 00:04:59.220 
want to you know how did I really want

00:04:59.220 --> 00:05:01.340 
want to you know how did I really want
to<00:04:59.280> kind<00:04:59.340> of<00:04:59.460> do<00:04:59.640> it<00:04:59.760> he's<00:04:59.970> a<00:05:00.000> modern<00:05:00.930> warfare<00:05:01.080> 2

00:05:01.340 --> 00:05:01.350 
to kind of do it he's a modern warfare 2

00:05:01.350 --> 00:05:02.780 
to kind of do it he's a modern warfare 2
it's<00:05:01.500> worth<00:05:01.650> and<00:05:01.830> caught<00:05:01.919> for<00:05:02.100> tat<00:05:02.370> be<00:05:02.550> alone

00:05:02.780 --> 00:05:02.790 
it's worth and caught for tat be alone

00:05:02.790 --> 00:05:07.490 
it's worth and caught for tat be alone
but<00:05:03.630> I<00:05:03.660> personally<00:05:05.720> well<00:05:06.720> I<00:05:06.750> mean<00:05:07.260> I

00:05:07.490 --> 00:05:07.500 
but I personally well I mean I

00:05:07.500 --> 00:05:09.350 
but I personally well I mean I
personally<00:05:07.680> think<00:05:08.400> that<00:05:08.550> caught<00:05:08.820> for<00:05:09.120> is<00:05:09.240> the

00:05:09.350 --> 00:05:09.360 
personally think that caught for is the

00:05:09.360 --> 00:05:11.870 
personally think that caught for is the
more<00:05:09.540> balanced<00:05:09.960> game<00:05:10.200> and<00:05:10.470> so<00:05:10.650> I<00:05:11.040> come<00:05:11.460> back<00:05:11.669> to

00:05:11.870 --> 00:05:11.880 
more balanced game and so I come back to

00:05:11.880 --> 00:05:13.520 
more balanced game and so I come back to
it<00:05:11.970> more<00:05:12.180> often<00:05:12.360> than<00:05:12.630> not<00:05:12.690> but<00:05:13.020> I<00:05:13.080> still<00:05:13.320> like

00:05:13.520 --> 00:05:13.530 
it more often than not but I still like

00:05:13.530 --> 00:05:15.050 
it more often than not but I still like
to<00:05:13.710> play<00:05:13.830> modern<00:05:14.070> warfare<00:05:14.100> 2<00:05:14.430> because<00:05:14.790> it<00:05:14.940> is

00:05:15.050 --> 00:05:15.060 
to play modern warfare 2 because it is

00:05:15.060 --> 00:05:18.110 
to play modern warfare 2 because it is
new<00:05:15.390> and<00:05:15.690> it<00:05:16.050> is<00:05:16.169> what<00:05:16.320> people<00:05:16.590> like<00:05:16.740> to<00:05:16.890> see<00:05:17.120> so
