00:03:14.350 --> 00:03:14.360 
go over the start line challenge

00:03:14.360 --> 00:03:16.699 
go over the start line challenge
now<00:03:15.360> they're<00:03:15.510> saying<00:03:15.720> everyone<00:03:16.140> off<00:03:16.260> in<00:03:16.440> waves

00:03:16.699 --> 00:03:16.709 
now they're saying everyone off in waves

now they're saying everyone off in waves
of<00:03:17.040> about<00:03:17.569> 500<00:03:18.569> attack<00:03:18.750> I'm<00:03:20.180> just<00:03:21.180> a<00:03:21.270> string

00:03:21.530 --> 00:03:21.540 
of about 500 attack I'm just a string

00:03:21.540 --> 00:03:23.110 
of about 500 attack I'm just a string
people<00:03:21.840> out<00:03:21.989> on<00:03:22.020> the<00:03:22.200> road<00:03:22.410> otherwise

people out on the road otherwise

00:03:23.120 --> 00:03:25.430 
people out on the road otherwise
everyone<00:03:24.120> would<00:03:24.270> hit<00:03:24.420> that<00:03:24.450> first<00:03:24.840> section<00:03:25.319> of

00:03:25.430 --> 00:03:25.440 
everyone would hit that first section of

00:03:25.440 --> 00:03:26.900 
everyone would hit that first section of
cobblestones<00:03:26.220> and<00:03:26.400> it<00:03:26.550> would<00:03:26.640> be<00:03:26.700> a<00:03:26.730> big

00:03:26.900 --> 00:03:26.910 
cobblestones and it would be a big

00:03:26.910 --> 00:03:28.030 
cobblestones and it would be a big
logjam

00:03:28.030 --> 00:03:28.040 
logjam

00:03:28.040 --> 00:03:30.199 
logjam
there<00:03:29.040> was<00:03:29.130> a<00:03:29.160> slight<00:03:29.430> headwind<00:03:29.970> for<00:03:30.150> the

00:03:30.199 --> 00:03:30.209 
there was a slight headwind for the

00:03:30.209 --> 00:03:32.270 
there was a slight headwind for the
first<00:03:30.450> road<00:03:30.780> section<00:03:31.290> of<00:03:31.380> the<00:03:31.470> ride<00:03:31.650> which

first road section of the ride which

00:03:32.280 --> 00:03:34.070 
first road section of the ride which
made<00:03:32.489> things<00:03:32.730> easy<00:03:33.000> if<00:03:33.360> you<00:03:33.630> could<00:03:33.750> stay<00:03:33.989> in

00:03:34.070 --> 00:03:34.080 
made things easy if you could stay in

00:03:34.080 --> 00:03:37.190 
made things easy if you could stay in
the<00:03:34.200> slipstream<00:03:34.560> of<00:03:34.860> the<00:03:34.950> group<00:03:35.930> once<00:03:36.930> we<00:03:37.080> hit

00:03:37.190 --> 00:03:37.200 
the slipstream of the group once we hit

00:03:37.200 --> 00:03:39.229 
the slipstream of the group once we hit
the<00:03:37.350> pave<00:03:37.769> though<00:03:38.010> it<00:03:38.310> was<00:03:38.489> every<00:03:38.880> man<00:03:38.910> for

the pave though it was every man for

00:03:39.239 --> 00:03:41.420 
the pave though it was every man for
himself<00:03:39.300> but<00:03:40.290> power<00:03:40.530> that<00:03:40.800> you<00:03:40.890> need<00:03:40.920> to<00:03:41.220> put

00:03:41.420 --> 00:03:41.430 
himself but power that you need to put

00:03:41.430 --> 00:03:44.559 
himself but power that you need to put
in<00:03:41.610> is<00:03:41.730> about<00:03:41.970> double<00:03:42.450> back<00:03:42.660> to<00:03:42.840> the<00:03:42.930> tarmac

00:03:44.559 --> 00:03:44.569 
in is about double back to the tarmac

00:03:44.569 --> 00:03:46.820 
in is about double back to the tarmac
you<00:03:45.569> need<00:03:45.690> to<00:03:45.780> keep<00:03:45.930> your<00:03:46.080> hands<00:03:46.380> loose<00:03:46.650> as

00:03:46.820 --> 00:03:46.830 
you need to keep your hands loose as

00:03:46.830 --> 00:03:48.890 
you need to keep your hands loose as
possible<00:03:46.860> on<00:03:47.370> the<00:03:47.430> handlebars<00:03:47.970> it's<00:03:48.480> too<00:03:48.720> much

00:03:48.890 --> 00:03:48.900 
possible on the handlebars it's too much

00:03:48.900 --> 00:03:50.780 
possible on the handlebars it's too much
to<00:03:49.080> ride<00:03:49.260> on<00:03:49.410> the<00:03:49.500> drops<00:03:49.769> and<00:03:49.980> resting<00:03:50.610> on<00:03:50.700> the

00:03:50.780 --> 00:03:50.790 
to ride on the drops and resting on the

to ride on the drops and resting on the
brake<00:03:51.030> levers<00:03:51.450> is<00:03:51.840> definitely<00:03:52.290> not<00:03:52.380> a<00:03:52.440> good

00:03:52.670 --> 00:03:52.680 
brake levers is definitely not a good

00:03:52.680 --> 00:03:53.410 
brake levers is definitely not a good
idea

00:03:53.410 --> 00:03:53.420 
idea

00:03:53.420 --> 00:03:55.670 
idea
most<00:03:54.420> people<00:03:54.690> ride<00:03:54.870> on<00:03:55.050> the<00:03:55.110> crown<00:03:55.440> of<00:03:55.470> the
