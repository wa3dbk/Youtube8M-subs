you will be able to control the mirrors

00:02:17.720 --> 00:02:20.800 
you will be able to control the mirrors
and<00:02:18.410> use<00:02:18.650> them<00:02:18.980> as<00:02:19.280> a<00:02:19.310> gateway<00:02:19.700> to<00:02:19.940> return<00:02:20.540> to

00:02:31.870 --> 00:02:31.880 
then you get this little cutscene where

00:02:31.880 --> 00:02:33.670 
then you get this little cutscene where
it's<00:02:32.030> going<00:02:32.270> to<00:02:32.300> be<00:02:32.420> having<00:02:32.840> these<00:02:32.989> spindles

00:03:01.840 --> 00:03:01.850 
this one this is the wrong one and it

00:03:01.850 --> 00:03:04.120 
this one this is the wrong one and it
does<00:03:02.000> that<00:03:02.239> Glock<00:03:02.660> glass-breaking<00:03:03.440> animation

00:03:04.120 --> 00:03:04.130 
does that Glock glass-breaking animation

00:03:04.130 --> 00:03:06.460 
does that Glock glass-breaking animation
it<00:03:04.340> does<00:03:04.760> that<00:03:04.940> for<00:03:04.970> every<00:03:05.420> single<00:03:05.690> one<00:03:05.900> except

00:03:08.120 --> 00:03:09.850 
the correct one so I was just showing
you<00:03:08.239> what<00:03:08.420> the<00:03:08.630> the<00:03:08.930> incorrect<00:03:09.350> one<00:03:09.620> looks

00:03:09.850 --> 00:03:09.860 
you what the the incorrect one looks

00:03:09.860 --> 00:03:12.880 
you what the the incorrect one looks
like<00:03:10.269> this<00:03:11.269> is<00:03:11.420> the<00:03:11.450> actual<00:03:11.900> one<00:03:12.110> that<00:03:12.140> it's

00:03:12.880 --> 00:03:12.890 
like this is the actual one that it's

00:03:12.890 --> 00:03:15.460 
like this is the actual one that it's
the<00:03:13.070> only<00:03:13.370> one<00:03:13.519> that<00:03:13.730> works<00:03:13.880> so<00:03:14.299> you<00:03:14.390> just<00:03:14.540> keep

00:03:15.460 --> 00:03:15.470 
the only one that works so you just keep

00:03:15.470 --> 00:03:16.990 
the only one that works so you just keep
tapping<00:03:15.650> on<00:03:15.920> the<00:03:16.010> circle<00:03:16.340> button<00:03:16.489> it's<00:03:16.820> going

00:03:16.990 --> 00:03:17.000 
tapping on the circle button it's going

00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:21.699 
tapping on the circle button it's going
to<00:03:17.140> rewind<00:03:18.140> time<00:03:18.290> so<00:03:18.739> to<00:03:18.799> speak<00:03:20.290> it<00:03:21.290> starts<00:03:21.620> out

00:03:21.699 --> 00:03:21.709 
to rewind time so to speak it starts out

00:03:21.709 --> 00:03:23.080 
to rewind time so to speak it starts out
with<00:03:21.769> a<00:03:21.920> crack<00:03:22.160> in<00:03:22.370> and<00:03:22.549> then<00:03:22.640> it<00:03:22.730> gets<00:03:22.820> to<00:03:22.940> the

00:03:23.080 --> 00:03:23.090 
with a crack in and then it gets to the

00:03:23.090 --> 00:03:25.990 
with a crack in and then it gets to the
Barbarian<00:03:23.660> right<00:03:24.290> there<00:03:24.530> and<00:03:24.769> that<00:03:25.000> it

00:03:25.990 --> 00:03:26.000 
Barbarian right there and that it

00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:28.840 
Barbarian right there and that it
ultimately<00:03:26.209> gets<00:03:26.750> to<00:03:26.959> where<00:03:27.140> Zeus<00:03:27.500> of<00:03:27.850> Slade

00:03:28.840 --> 00:03:28.850 
ultimately gets to where Zeus of Slade

00:03:28.850 --> 00:03:32.020 
ultimately gets to where Zeus of Slade
Kratos<00:03:29.450> and<00:03:29.720> then<00:03:30.500> once<00:03:30.890> you<00:03:31.130> see<00:03:31.370> that<00:03:31.400> just

00:03:32.020 --> 00:03:32.030 
Kratos and then once you see that just

00:03:32.030 --> 00:03:36.280 
Kratos and then once you see that just
let<00:03:32.239> go<00:03:32.450> and<00:03:32.630> then<00:03:33.730> jump<00:03:34.730> because<00:03:35.570> from<00:03:36.079> where

00:03:36.280 --> 00:03:36.290 
let go and then jump because from where

00:03:36.290 --> 00:03:37.720 
let go and then jump because from where
you<00:03:36.410> stand<00:03:36.709> right<00:03:36.950> there<00:03:36.980> you<00:03:37.280> can't<00:03:37.489> stop

00:03:37.720 --> 00:03:37.730 
you stand right there you can't stop

00:03:37.730 --> 00:03:39.610 
you stand right there you can't stop
time<00:03:37.910> just<00:03:38.510> get<00:03:38.690> over<00:03:38.870> to<00:03:38.989> about<00:03:39.200> where<00:03:39.320> I<00:03:39.380> am

00:03:39.610 --> 00:03:39.620 
time just get over to about where I am

00:03:39.620 --> 00:03:42.039 
time just get over to about where I am
stop<00:03:39.950> time<00:03:40.220> and<00:03:40.519> then<00:03:41.000> you<00:03:41.630> can<00:03:41.780> slow<00:03:42.019> down

00:03:42.039 --> 00:03:42.049 
stop time and then you can slow down

00:03:42.049 --> 00:03:43.840 
stop time and then you can slow down
time<00:03:42.470> up<00:03:42.769> until<00:03:42.920> the<00:03:43.130> point<00:03:43.310> where<00:03:43.519> you<00:03:43.609> first

00:03:43.840 --> 00:03:43.850 
time up until the point where you first

00:03:43.850 --> 00:03:46.360 
time up until the point where you first
interact<00:03:44.420> with<00:03:44.570> this<00:03:44.720> crank<00:03:45.049> and<00:03:45.260> I<00:03:46.010> also<00:03:46.160> want

00:03:46.360 --> 00:03:46.370 
interact with this crank and I also want

00:03:46.370 --> 00:03:50.259 
interact with this crank and I also want
to<00:03:46.430> mention<00:03:46.549> that<00:03:47.500> you<00:03:48.500> can<00:03:48.859> save<00:03:49.640> it<00:03:49.850> too

00:03:50.259 --> 00:03:50.269 
to mention that you can save it too

00:03:50.269 --> 00:03:52.960 
to mention that you can save it too
before<00:03:50.630> you<00:03:50.750> jump<00:03:50.989> into<00:03:51.170> the<00:03:51.350> mirror<00:03:51.650> I<00:03:51.970> would

00:03:52.960 --> 00:03:52.970 
before you jump into the mirror I would

00:03:52.970 --> 00:03:54.580 
before you jump into the mirror I would
recommend<00:03:53.359> doing<00:03:53.450> that<00:03:53.720> I<00:03:53.750> don't<00:03:54.019> do<00:03:54.200> that<00:03:54.380> in

00:03:54.580 --> 00:03:54.590 
recommend doing that I don't do that in

00:03:54.590 --> 00:03:57.069 
recommend doing that I don't do that in
this<00:03:55.090> in<00:03:56.090> this<00:03:56.299> run<00:03:56.510> because<00:03:56.810> I've<00:03:56.930> already

00:03:57.069 --> 00:03:57.079
