00:00:03.010 --> 00:00:07.569
 hi my name is sonia i like a 

00:00:05.319 --> 00:00:10.240
 heap learn how to make ribbon ties 

00:00:07.569 --> 00:00:15.180
 perfect cloths whether they are single doubles 

00:00:10.240 --> 00:00:15.180
 or triples with a super easy technique 

00:00:18.780 --> 00:00:23.450
 The materials that we need are very 

00:00:21.090 --> 00:00:26.940
 simple we need fabric tape 

00:00:23.450 --> 00:00:29.940
 wide and one that is thinner cardboard 

00:00:26.940 --> 00:00:31.410
 of thick box 4 sticks of these 

00:00:29.940 --> 00:00:35.570
 make skewers that are available in the 

00:00:31.410 --> 00:00:38.700
 supermarket scissors two clamps rule 

00:00:35.570 --> 00:00:41.690
 ballpoint pen or pencil and a lighter for 

00:00:38.700 --> 00:00:41.690
 burn the tips 

00:00:45.370 --> 00:00:49.180
 this technique to make ties is going to 

00:00:47.500 --> 00:00:51.520
 love because in addition to that we can 

00:00:49.180 --> 00:00:53.079
 we can make perfect bonds 

00:00:51.520 --> 00:00:55.719
 in a few minutes so for the 

00:00:53.079 --> 00:00:58.180
 people who sell ties is ideal this 

00:00:55.719 --> 00:01:00.129
 technique for it as you can see here 

00:00:58.180 --> 00:01:02.470
 We are going to need a thick cardboard 

00:01:00.129 --> 00:01:04.239
 box as I have here I have cut out a 

00:01:02.470 --> 00:01:06.759
 small piece because the ties that I'm going to 

00:01:04.239 --> 00:01:08.350
 do for the tutorial they are small but 

00:01:06.759 --> 00:01:10.930
 if they are going to make big ties and they are going to 

00:01:08.350 --> 00:01:14.110
 use a wider tape we are going to 

00:01:10.930 --> 00:01:16.990
 cut for example a piece of cardboard 

00:01:14.110 --> 00:01:19.060
 so we're going to need 4 sticks 

00:01:16.990 --> 00:01:21.369
 of these to make wooden skewers 

00:01:19.060 --> 00:01:23.500
 thin that is the most practical thing I've 

00:01:21.369 --> 00:01:26.009
 found to do it and it's very 

00:01:23.500 --> 00:01:28.780
 simple let's start with the rule 

00:01:26.009 --> 00:01:31.539
 putting it like that and let's see what size 

00:01:28.780 --> 00:01:33.399
 we want to make for the tie myself by 

00:01:31.539 --> 00:01:35.140
 example I want to make them six 

00:01:33.399 --> 00:01:37.890
 centimeters then I'm going to mark 

00:01:35.140 --> 00:01:41.500
 here six centimeters and I'm going to mark 

00:01:37.890 --> 00:01:44.350
 here two centimeters four centimeters 

00:01:41.500 --> 00:01:46.509
 and so I have the same separation in all 

00:01:44.350 --> 00:01:48.850
 the measurements when we look for the cardboard 

00:01:46.509 --> 00:01:51.220
 box, ideally it is a cardboard that 

00:01:48.850 --> 00:01:51.909
 the holes are a bit small for 

00:01:51.220 --> 00:01:55.530
 that when I 

00:01:51.909 --> 00:01:58.090
 well the skewers of skewers / 

00:01:55.530 --> 00:02:00.250
 pressed there are cartons that we put the 

00:01:58.090 --> 00:02:02.590
 sticks and they are more loose but if 

00:02:00.250 --> 00:02:05.319
 they stay that way is ideal because we 

00:02:02.590 --> 00:02:07.299
 we can move these sticks to 

00:02:05.319 --> 00:02:09.340
 our arrangement so that if 

00:02:07.299 --> 00:02:11.980
 we want to make the biggest ties 

00:02:09.340 --> 00:02:14.560
 we simply move the sticks and 

00:02:11.980 --> 00:02:16.870
 is and you see what I have done is 

00:02:14.560 --> 00:02:18.549
 to cross the sticks for the marks that 

00:02:16.870 --> 00:02:20.440
 I've done here I have the tape that I'm going to 

00:02:18.549 --> 00:02:22.930
 use is a centimeter tape in 

00:02:20.440 --> 00:02:25.569
 medium can also be 2 centimeters 

00:02:22.930 --> 00:02:29.410
 let's start by putting the tape in like this and 

00:02:25.569 --> 00:02:32.160
 we are going to pass the one in this way 

00:02:29.410 --> 00:02:35.550
 if one does not now what we are going to do is 

00:02:32.160 --> 00:02:37.460
 pass it one if one does not 

00:02:35.550 --> 00:02:41.950
 back 

00:02:37.460 --> 00:02:44.460
 we repeat again we pass 

00:02:41.950 --> 00:02:47.280
 and we repeat again 

00:02:44.460 --> 00:02:49.320
 and now we repeat again if I 

00:02:47.280 --> 00:02:51.810
 I want the tie to be double already 

00:02:49.320 --> 00:02:53.880
 I have the rounds given here I have two 

00:02:51.810 --> 00:02:55.920
 sides of the loop and here I have two sides 

00:02:53.880 --> 00:02:59.460
 but I'm going to triple it so what 

00:02:55.920 --> 00:03:01.890
 I will pass once again and again now 

00:02:59.460 --> 00:03:03.990
 you can see that here I have three sides and 

00:03:01.890 --> 00:03:05.760
 here I have three sides we are going to look 

00:03:03.990 --> 00:03:08.100
 some tweezers and we're going to hold the 

00:03:05.760 --> 00:03:10.080
 ends of the tape before fastening 

00:03:08.100 --> 00:03:12.660
 this end what we are going to do is 

00:03:10.080 --> 00:03:15.720
 lower this and hold with the clamp 

00:03:12.660 --> 00:03:17.850
 we cut the excess and now we need 

00:03:15.720 --> 00:03:20.910
 a thinner tape for the center 

00:03:17.850 --> 00:03:23.700
 this tape we are going to put it like this and the 

00:03:20.910 --> 00:03:25.680
 we're going to be behind this would be the 

00:03:23.700 --> 00:03:27.490
 back of the tie so let's go to 

00:03:25.680 --> 00:03:30.190
 make a knot 

00:03:27.490 --> 00:03:32.110
 we remove the tweezers and we can remove 

00:03:30.190 --> 00:03:34.180
 the loop and you can see that it has 

00:03:32.110 --> 00:03:35.920
 come out the triple tie now what 

00:03:34.180 --> 00:03:38.500
 we have is to cut the tapes of 

00:03:35.920 --> 00:03:40.740
 back and those ahead with the 

00:03:38.500 --> 00:03:43.230
 lighter we are going to burn 

00:03:40.740 --> 00:03:45.630
 and to put a hook on the back is 

00:03:43.230 --> 00:03:48.840
 very simple we put a little silicone 

00:03:45.630 --> 00:03:51.470
 hot liquid or silicone and we stick it 

00:03:48.840 --> 00:03:51.470
 the hook 

00:03:56.470 --> 00:04:00.610
 if we are going to use stamped tape as 

00:03:58.660 --> 00:04:02.950
 in this case it has a stamp by 

00:04:00.610 --> 00:04:05.470
 one side and it is not stamped by the other 

00:04:02.950 --> 00:04:08.380
 it does not help us to make the tie 

00:04:05.470 --> 00:04:10.300
 interlaced between the sticks only 

00:04:08.380 --> 00:04:12.130
 it helps us to make simple ties 

00:04:10.300 --> 00:04:14.680
 like the one I'm going to show you now is 

00:04:12.130 --> 00:04:16.209
 tape that I have here measures 2.5 

00:04:14.680 --> 00:04:19.180
 centimeters so I've had to 

00:04:16.209 --> 00:04:21.670
 separate more the sticks and has looked for a 

00:04:19.180 --> 00:04:24.010
 Largest piece of cardboard to make 

00:04:21.670 --> 00:04:26.170
 we can do this simple bond 

00:04:24.010 --> 00:04:29.290
 two laps or three laps we're going to 

00:04:26.170 --> 00:04:31.840
 start here holding the end and 

00:04:29.290 --> 00:04:34.900
 let's start spinning in this way 

00:04:31.840 --> 00:04:37.060
 in this case I'm just going to do it in two 

00:04:34.900 --> 00:04:38.950
 round here I have two laps of a 

00:04:37.060 --> 00:04:41.220
 side and here I have two rounds of the other 

00:04:38.950 --> 00:04:43.530
 we cut the excess 

00:04:41.220 --> 00:04:46.080
 and here I have my thin ribbon to put 

00:04:43.530 --> 00:04:48.030
 in the center so I'm going to repeat as 

00:04:46.080 --> 00:04:50.130
 before I'm going to turn it around in this 

00:04:48.030 --> 00:04:51.810
 case they have seen that it is not a been 

00:04:50.130 --> 00:04:55.290
 this because there is no need 

00:04:51.810 --> 00:04:57.139
 so we help hard we cut the 

00:04:55.290 --> 00:04:59.770
 extremes 

00:04:57.139 --> 00:04:59.770
 we burn 

00:05:00.370 --> 00:05:06.419
 and open it so easy we have 

00:05:03.400 --> 00:05:06.419
 made a double loop 

00:05:11.030 --> 00:05:16.420
 and of course doing the two simple ones is 

00:05:13.640 --> 00:05:16.420
 very easy 

00:05:18.310 --> 00:05:24.420
 we give this form and we repeat with the 

00:05:20.800 --> 00:05:24.420
 tape let's tie from behind 

00:05:27.230 --> 00:05:33.129
 and there is another perfect link 

00:05:30.580 --> 00:05:35.740
 and have already seen how with such a technique 

00:05:33.129 --> 00:05:37.900
 simple that we can all do not 

00:05:35.740 --> 00:05:40.840
 ties leave the measures we want 

00:05:37.900 --> 00:05:43.530
 and always perfect whether they are simple 

00:05:40.840 --> 00:05:45.939
 double or triple so it only remains 

00:05:43.530 --> 00:05:48.400
 experiment with the thicknesses of 

00:05:45.939 --> 00:05:51.550
 tapes and the distances that we put 

00:05:48.400 --> 00:05:53.080
 between the sticks you already know that as 

00:05:51.550 --> 00:05:54.849
 I always hope you enjoyed the 

00:05:53.080 --> 00:05:57.129
