with the armor on

00:01:27.330 --> 00:01:29.780 
with the armor on
one<00:01:27.960> good<00:01:28.110> thing<00:01:28.170> about<00:01:28.320> the<00:01:28.530> mg36<00:01:29.190> probably

00:01:29.780 --> 00:01:29.790 
one good thing about the mg36 probably

00:01:29.790 --> 00:01:32.510 
one good thing about the mg36 probably
the<00:01:29.850> only<00:01:29.970> good<00:01:30.180> thing<00:01:30.210> with<00:01:30.480> the<00:01:30.630> mg36<00:01:31.350> is<00:01:31.770> the

00:01:32.510 --> 00:01:32.520 
the only good thing with the mg36 is the

00:01:32.520 --> 00:01:35.420 
the only good thing with the mg36 is the
reload<00:01:32.880> time<00:01:32.910> is<00:01:33.360> 3.8<00:01:34.110> which<00:01:34.740> is<00:01:34.950> pretty<00:01:35.100> fast

00:01:35.420 --> 00:01:35.430 
reload time is 3.8 which is pretty fast

00:01:35.430 --> 00:01:37.880 
reload time is 3.8 which is pretty fast
for<00:01:35.640> a<00:01:35.850> light<00:01:36.060> machine<00:01:36.390> gun<00:01:36.630> that's<00:01:37.560> almost

00:01:37.880 --> 00:01:37.890 
for a light machine gun that's almost

00:01:37.890 --> 00:01:41.690 
for a light machine gun that's almost
down<00:01:38.220> to<00:01:38.520> an<00:01:39.030> assault<00:01:39.360> gun<00:01:39.720> reload<00:01:40.260> time<00:01:40.700> so

00:01:41.690 --> 00:01:41.700 
down to an assault gun reload time so

00:01:41.700 --> 00:01:43.340 
down to an assault gun reload time so
that's<00:01:41.850> pretty<00:01:42.060> good<00:01:42.240> for<00:01:42.300> a<00:01:42.570> light<00:01:43.050> machine

00:01:43.340 --> 00:01:43.350 
that's pretty good for a light machine

00:01:43.350 --> 00:01:46.610 
that's pretty good for a light machine
gun<00:01:43.560> either<00:01:44.280> and<00:01:44.610> that<00:01:44.640> I<00:01:45.060> absolutely<00:01:46.050> hate

00:01:46.610 --> 00:01:46.620 
gun either and that I absolutely hate

00:01:46.620 --> 00:01:49.220 
gun either and that I absolutely hate
this<00:01:46.770> gun<00:01:47.010> and<00:01:47.690> you're<00:01:48.690> probably<00:01:48.870> wondering

00:01:49.220 --> 00:01:49.230 
this gun and you're probably wondering

00:01:49.230 --> 00:01:50.750 
this gun and you're probably wondering
why<00:01:49.320> there's<00:01:49.470> no<00:01:49.620> down<00:01:49.830> the<00:01:50.010> middle<00:01:50.160> because

00:01:50.750 --> 00:01:50.760 
why there's no down the middle because

00:01:50.760 --> 00:01:53.060 
why there's no down the middle because
hardcore<00:01:51.570> when<00:01:52.140> you<00:01:52.230> use<00:01:52.410> this<00:01:52.560> gun<00:01:52.770> there<00:01:53.010> is

00:01:53.060 --> 00:01:53.070 
hardcore when you use this gun there is

00:01:53.070 --> 00:01:54.620 
hardcore when you use this gun there is
no<00:01:53.250> dot<00:01:53.520> no<00:01:53.790> matter<00:01:54.030> if<00:01:54.210> you<00:01:54.330> put<00:01:54.510> the

00:01:54.620 --> 00:01:54.630 
no dot no matter if you put the

00:01:54.630 --> 00:01:56.450 
no dot no matter if you put the
four-time<00:01:55.050> scope<00:01:55.380> attachment<00:01:55.890> on<00:01:55.950> it<00:01:56.070> or<00:01:56.190> not

00:01:56.450 --> 00:01:56.460 
four-time scope attachment on it or not

00:01:56.460 --> 00:01:59.330 
four-time scope attachment on it or not
because<00:01:56.700> this<00:01:57.660> is<00:01:58.080> the<00:01:58.230> same<00:01:58.440> scope<00:01:58.800> that<00:01:59.010> has

00:01:59.330 --> 00:01:59.340 
because this is the same scope that has

00:01:59.340 --> 00:02:00.980 
because this is the same scope that has
even<00:01:59.760> if<00:01:59.820> you<00:01:59.910> put<00:02:00.030> the<00:02:00.150> four-time<00:02:00.510> scope<00:02:00.840> on

00:02:00.980 --> 00:02:00.990 
even if you put the four-time scope on

00:02:00.990 --> 00:02:02.960 
even if you put the four-time scope on
it<00:02:01.020> so<00:02:01.229> the<00:02:01.350> doc<00:02:01.530> the<00:02:01.890> red<00:02:02.070> dots<00:02:02.340> will<00:02:02.610> be<00:02:02.790> there

00:02:02.960 --> 00:02:02.970 
it so the doc the red dots will be there

00:02:02.970 --> 00:02:05.030 
it so the doc the red dots will be there
what<00:02:03.150> doesn't<00:02:03.390> come<00:02:03.510> up<00:02:03.690> I<00:02:03.900> do<00:02:04.560> not<00:02:04.830> know<00:02:04.920> why

00:02:05.030 --> 00:02:05.040 
what doesn't come up I do not know why

00:02:05.040 --> 00:02:10.060 
what doesn't come up I do not know why
it<00:02:05.220> does<00:02:05.520> that<00:02:06.050> but<00:02:07.050> that's<00:02:07.260> it<00:02:07.470> for<00:02:07.650> the<00:02:08.240> mg36

00:02:10.060 --> 00:02:10.070 
it does that but that's it for the mg36

00:02:10.070 --> 00:02:12.350 
it does that but that's it for the mg36
