00:00:07.140 --> 00:00:16.589
 Hello. Have you had a good New Year? Today, I made Sully makeup. 

00:00:12.210 --> 00:00:20.429
 I changed it a little so I can always do it. 

00:00:16.589 --> 00:00:24.989
 First, I 'm gonna put on a pink tone bass with a pearl on your face. 

00:00:20.429 --> 00:00:28.259
 If you put it in a place where you want to look more like a headstock, 

00:00:24.989 --> 00:00:31.050
 You can give your face a sense of volume. 

00:00:28.259 --> 00:00:35.370
 I 'm going to have a foundation for a long time today. 

00:00:31.050 --> 00:00:37.199
 I do not feel a little bit bright, but sunny skin is so bright, part bright 

00:00:35.370 --> 00:00:41.550
 I did not know fade. 

00:00:37.199 --> 00:00:48.510
 Take a pink lip brush and apply it all over the face 

00:00:41.550 --> 00:00:52.829
 It's my turn to put on my favorite concealer. 

00:00:48.510 --> 00:00:53.969
 While also highlighting the labels have a gay Silla tries when you go to spots 

00:00:52.829 --> 00:00:58.710
 I'll give you. 

00:00:53.969 --> 00:01:01.519
 The highlight is the tip of the eyeballs and the jaws where you need volume 

00:00:58.710 --> 00:01:01.519
 I 'll paint it. 

00:01:01.590 --> 00:01:03.620
 U 

00:01:06.490 --> 00:01:08.520
 U 

00:01:08.530 --> 00:01:16.479
 If you have done your makeup, this is the time to set it up . 

00:01:12.159 --> 00:01:21.460
 I 'm gonna set the face with the cash cow 3 pro powder. 

00:01:16.479 --> 00:01:24.270
 The particles are very rough and give a little smoother feeling . 

00:01:21.460 --> 00:01:24.270
 It's a bull 

00:01:24.430 --> 00:01:34.799
 I'm drawing the line now the most important is not too thick eyebrows, eyebrows to date 

00:01:29.170 --> 00:01:34.799
 And I'll draw it so that it's not too long to fit your eye size. 

00:01:37.890 --> 00:01:44.240
 I 'll give you a hint of eyebrows to brighten your eyebrow color. 

00:01:50.460 --> 00:01:57.270
 I'm going to make up with Mac Shadow today. 

00:01:53.820 --> 00:02:02.190
 First, you'll have a contour with the soba color. 

00:01:57.270 --> 00:02:09.170
 I'll give a slight shade to the top of the hoop to make my nose a little thinner. 

00:02:02.190 --> 00:02:09.170
 And I'll try to express a little more nose by shading the pole . 

00:02:09.750 --> 00:02:14.989
 Apply and be a little more overhead than lifting crease lines 

00:02:16.840 --> 00:02:24.390
 Now amass arms using eyeshadow gold of Gold Mind side 

00:02:20.680 --> 00:02:24.390
 Want to rub'm Overall 

00:02:27.790 --> 00:02:33.680
 U 

00:02:29.450 --> 00:02:38.050
 Using a beautiful coral beach eye shadow called Hara Disco, 

00:02:33.680 --> 00:02:38.050
 And I'll give you a little business card on the back. 

00:02:39.370 --> 00:02:46.890
 The eye has a larger DEMI first type liner to give a visible effect 

00:02:43.510 --> 00:02:46.890
 I'll fill the mucosa. 

00:02:48.700 --> 00:02:57.629
 And crash cache. He'll give you a glance with your misfortune. 

00:02:52.810 --> 00:02:57.629
 I'll light the back light with the brightest color 

00:03:00.460 --> 00:03:05.860
 Brown now has a shadow of a code that will have a helper tha Contouring 

00:03:04.630 --> 00:03:09.760
 It is. 

00:03:05.860 --> 00:03:16.920
 If you have done this eye shadow, it will be your liner. 

00:03:09.760 --> 00:03:16.920
 I'll put the liner on the bottom, and then I 'll raise the end slightly. 

00:03:21.570 --> 00:03:30.750
 I'm gonna take a little eyelash with the viewer before I get stuck. 

00:03:26.310 --> 00:03:35.790
 And with the long lashes that go toward the back end rather than in the eyes 

00:03:30.750 --> 00:03:38.940
 I 'll stick it to the eyeliner I've drawn before. 

00:03:35.790 --> 00:03:42.660
 I can solve it . 

00:03:38.940 --> 00:03:47.490
 If you put these false eyelashes on, 

00:03:42.660 --> 00:03:54.830
 I'll put you on the mascara with real eyelashes. 

00:03:47.490 --> 00:03:54.830
 Now it's time to do the shading. I'll shade the jaw and forehead. 

00:03:58.230 --> 00:04:02.730
 5 

00:04:00.090 --> 00:04:08.240
 I 'll use pink tones. 

00:04:02.730 --> 00:04:08.240
 I 'll give it a little broader in the diagonal direction from the clown. 

00:04:15.240 --> 00:04:19.890
 My favorite bob will be highlighted with anxious shimmer brad 

00:04:19.020 --> 00:04:24.780
 I'm calling. 

00:04:19.890 --> 00:04:29.870
 I 'll give you a highland on top of the cocktab and below. 

00:04:24.780 --> 00:04:29.870
 Instead, the contouring nose will not be highlighted. 

00:04:38.280 --> 00:04:45.420
 Finally, you're gonna put lipstick on. 

00:04:40.860 --> 00:04:48.810
 I 'm going to mix two lipsticks from cache cache today to express my lips. 

00:04:45.420 --> 00:04:53.520
 I 'm going to use Scucky Red and Morning Rose . 

00:04:48.810 --> 00:04:57.900
 I'll mix red and dark pink to make a little more red. 

00:04:53.520 --> 00:05:03.710
 Yeah, the part you put out is a little over your lip line, 

00:04:57.900 --> 00:05:03.710
 If you do this, you'll be able to produce a little bit more lips 

00:05:08.210 --> 00:05:18.320
 Today, this way, the make-up is completed. 

00:05:13.400 --> 00:05:23.120
 It's perfect. It's not exactly the same, but I tried to make it look similar. 

00:05:18.320 --> 00:05:26.680
 Thanks for the video zest until now I'll see you next time to find a more fruitful metaphor 

00:05:23.120 --> 00:05:26.680
