00:00:05.490 --> 00:00:08.849
 for everyone today we are the new video of 

00:00:07.740 --> 00:00:11.400
 today 

00:00:08.849 --> 00:00:13.589
 we will explain how it is exchanged 

00:00:11.400 --> 00:00:18.150
 broadcast this video have me 

00:00:13.589 --> 00:00:20.090
 asked in many we say and we will see how 

00:00:18.150 --> 00:00:23.640
 you change the whole transmission or 

00:00:20.090 --> 00:00:28.429
 chain and pinion crown and therefore also 

00:00:23.640 --> 00:00:31.529
 how to remove the rear wheel 

00:00:28.429 --> 00:00:33.960
 let's go to see the proceedings 

00:00:31.529 --> 00:00:35.070
 now we will allow the chain to 

00:00:33.960 --> 00:00:37.080
 disassemble in chain 

00:00:35.070 --> 00:00:40.500
 most chains have one 

00:00:37.080 --> 00:00:42.420
 false mesh or a connected mesh 

00:00:40.500 --> 00:00:45.150
 from a clip 

00:00:42.420 --> 00:00:48.030
 simply remove the clip e 

00:00:45.150 --> 00:00:54.930
 then remove the shirt that you want to remove 

00:00:48.030 --> 00:00:59.180
 all you have to do is press with the con 

00:00:54.930 --> 00:00:59.180
 clip and release the clip 

00:01:01.309 --> 00:01:11.700
 in another photo there is the clip 

00:01:04.710 --> 00:01:16.560
 we dismantle the plate and teramo via la 

00:01:11.700 --> 00:01:18.719
 false shirt so we have the chain 

00:01:16.560 --> 00:01:22.320
 free and we can take it apart once 

00:01:18.719 --> 00:01:25.020
 disassembled the chain then we can pass 

00:01:22.320 --> 00:01:27.539
 freely disassemble the wheel in this 

00:01:25.020 --> 00:01:31.409
 We need a 27-promoter key 

00:01:27.539 --> 00:01:33.390
 it was said in the external note ha 

00:01:31.409 --> 00:01:37.009
 disassembled the nut by challenging the pin 

00:01:33.390 --> 00:01:37.009
 we extract the wheel 

00:01:58.090 --> 00:02:02.700
 hopefully it doesn't stay a little hard you can 

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:18.489
 bring it a little bit and hopefully the wheel 

00:02:14.620 --> 00:02:21.970
 we are simply going to dismantle 

00:02:18.489 --> 00:02:27.760
 the crown with the key of 13 sent to 

00:02:21.970 --> 00:02:43.810
 say to the dice and with a torx we go to 

00:02:27.760 --> 00:02:49.709
 unscrew to replace opinion 

00:02:43.810 --> 00:02:55.480
 just take this away 

00:02:49.709 --> 00:02:59.079
 ledger with a caliper the slips outcomes 

00:02:55.480 --> 00:03:03.010
 radio to the pinion for mounting 

00:02:59.079 --> 00:03:06.100
 the reverse procedure now in the 

00:03:03.010 --> 00:03:09.430
 assembly of the crown screws one 

00:03:06.100 --> 00:03:13.299
 time is established with the new horns 

00:03:09.430 --> 00:03:15.250
 screws will be sprinkled the fillet with a 

00:03:13.299 --> 00:03:17.049
 bit of fillets in order to hold firm 

00:03:15.250 --> 00:03:23.220
 prevent these screws from being lost 

00:03:17.049 --> 00:03:25.480
 easily now in the reassembly of the 

00:03:23.220 --> 00:03:29.380
 of the wheel 

00:03:25.480 --> 00:03:33.030
 we are going to space the tablets in 

00:03:29.380 --> 00:03:36.549
 so as to facilitate assembly 

00:03:33.030 --> 00:03:40.840
 inserting to the disc once done 

00:03:36.549 --> 00:03:48.190
 this we aim the wheel with the crown 

00:03:40.840 --> 00:03:50.440
 new and we are going to put the chain with 

00:03:48.190 --> 00:03:52.829
 the false jersey as we did first 

00:03:50.440 --> 00:03:52.829
 and disassembly 

00:03:54.419 --> 00:04:00.489
 once the ruotolo prize is entered 

00:03:57.280 --> 00:04:01.950
 criticized when the grease grafted the 

00:04:00.489 --> 00:04:05.160
 chain 

00:04:01.950 --> 00:04:09.110
 I recommend putting the chain with the 

00:04:05.160 --> 00:04:09.110
 clip several times in this sense 

00:04:10.220 --> 00:04:19.010
 and not in the other because it could 

00:04:12.860 --> 00:04:21.070
 take off we put what we have been doing e 

00:04:19.010 --> 00:04:25.880
 adjust the correct chain tension 

00:04:21.070 --> 00:04:32.600
 simply using the chain tensioner 

00:04:25.880 --> 00:04:36.310
 must drop the counter nut once 

00:04:32.600 --> 00:04:36.310
 loosened and against degree 

00:04:38.150 --> 00:04:42.310
 let's turn the screw 

00:04:42.840 --> 00:04:50.820
 so that you have the attention 

00:04:44.550 --> 00:04:53.280
 right on the chain to have control 

00:04:50.820 --> 00:04:55.940
 how they think they have the chain 

00:04:53.280 --> 00:04:57.870
 check the manual I can manual 

00:04:55.940 --> 00:05:02.940
 generally me in this position 

00:04:57.870 --> 00:05:07.139
 I dye four fingers about to see if 

00:05:02.940 --> 00:05:11.220
 a right tension and then we noticed 

00:05:07.139 --> 00:05:13.699
 the new transmission thanks to all for 

00:05:11.220 --> 00:05:13.699
 the vision
