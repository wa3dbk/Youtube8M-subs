00:00:16.360 --> 00:00:21.790
 I do not decide before I start the video and 

00:00:19.900 --> 00:00:26.500
 I would like to send you a very 

00:00:21.790 --> 00:00:29.369

 a carl amos 

00:00:32.020 --> 00:00:38.320
 mispronounce think forgiveness because 

00:00:35.070 --> 00:00:40.720
 it was his birthday in april 

00:00:38.320 --> 00:00:44.500
 them two and they asked me for a greeting because 

00:00:40.720 --> 00:00:46.900
 it's your birthday days and happy birthday 

00:00:44.500 --> 00:00:51.420
 a little late but happy 

00:00:46.900 --> 00:00:51.420
 birthday the theme of this video 

00:00:51.610 --> 00:00:56.800
 my tattoo have been leaving me many 

00:00:54.190 --> 00:00:58.750
 questions everywhere and what better 

00:00:56.800 --> 00:01:01.390
 way of answering that with a wine 

00:00:58.750 --> 00:01:03.579
 sorry the delay is the third time 

00:01:01.390 --> 00:01:06.189
 I record in this video why 

00:01:03.579 --> 00:01:09.460
 and I did not get the ideas and everything and not 

00:01:06.189 --> 00:01:11.200
 I knew how to explain it, besides not 

00:01:09.460 --> 00:01:14.409
 I know I did not like the others I recorded 

00:01:11.200 --> 00:01:16.330
 then I'm sorry but here we go the 

00:01:14.409 --> 00:01:20.340
 question number one was where I did it 

00:01:16.330 --> 00:01:24.000
 and how much it cost me I did it 

00:01:20.340 --> 00:01:26.070
 in front of the satellite world good 

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:28.979
 I think that passing satellite 

00:01:26.070 --> 00:01:33.210
 here in mexico if in a small place that 

00:01:28.979 --> 00:01:36.750
 called rock shop and it cost me 400 pesos 

00:01:33.210 --> 00:01:39.959
 how long it took was pretty fast 

00:01:36.750 --> 00:01:42.990
 I thought that it was going to last a lot and that 

00:01:39.959 --> 00:01:46.429
 to suffer a lot but they were not more than 

00:01:42.990 --> 00:01:49.709
 15 minutes is dedicated to someone to me 

00:01:46.429 --> 00:01:52.590
 more than anyone 2 that's why it's like 

00:01:49.709 --> 00:01:54.200
 so that I read it is a phrase that 

00:01:52.590 --> 00:01:55.990
 love there 

00:01:54.200 --> 00:02:00.390
 what 

00:01:55.990 --> 00:02:00.390
 Well, if it 's for me then 

00:02:01.759 --> 00:02:10.370
 he did not dedicate himself to anyone he would not prefer to be 

00:02:05.490 --> 00:02:13.530
 after tokyo hotel is not not the 

00:02:10.370 --> 00:02:15.569
 ask this question have they left me 

00:02:13.530 --> 00:02:17.730
 a good many times and I do not understand why 

00:02:15.569 --> 00:02:19.769
 they ask me that if I had wanted 

00:02:17.730 --> 00:02:22.250
 completely after this that I have 

00:02:19.769 --> 00:02:25.760
 libera is everything but not 

00:02:22.250 --> 00:02:28.370
 and honestly I 'm not 200 at 

00:02:25.760 --> 00:02:29.830
 same save that question you plan to do 

00:02:28.370 --> 00:02:33.490
 themes 

00:02:29.830 --> 00:02:35.680
 there are still many that hurt so much 

00:02:33.490 --> 00:02:38.400
 I would say that 

00:02:35.680 --> 00:02:40.890
 from 1 to 10 

00:02:38.400 --> 00:02:43.380
 I will go with 4 

00:02:40.890 --> 00:02:45.920
 that is 

00:02:43.380 --> 00:02:48.670
 the only part that really hurt 

00:02:45.920 --> 00:02:52.270
 It was 

00:02:48.670 --> 00:02:57.590
 without new my hand I do not know is that I do not know 

00:02:52.270 --> 00:03:01.849
 good note here is a little bone 

00:02:57.590 --> 00:03:05.599
 as here is happening and it is marked a lot 

00:03:01.849 --> 00:03:10.340
 concert here is well this one visited here 

00:03:05.599 --> 00:03:11.610
 it hurt so horrible I felt as if I 

00:03:10.340 --> 00:03:15.400
 drill 

00:03:11.610 --> 00:03:18.489
 from here to here 

00:03:15.400 --> 00:03:22.799
 and that's the only thing that suffers the rest or 

00:03:18.489 --> 00:03:28.250
 everything else did not hurt anything good 

00:03:22.799 --> 00:03:32.690
 if it hurts but is tolerable 

00:03:28.250 --> 00:03:35.810
 do not cry thankfully do not cry you feel 

00:03:32.690 --> 00:03:37.670
 as if they were burning you 

00:03:35.810 --> 00:03:39.700
 you exist during when with something very 

00:03:37.670 --> 00:03:42.239
 hot 

00:03:39.700 --> 00:03:42.239
 but 

00:03:43.310 --> 00:03:51.430
 almost does not hurt and the last question is 

00:03:47.910 --> 00:03:55.959
 what my parents told me 

00:03:51.430 --> 00:03:59.560
 I only taught it to members 

00:03:55.959 --> 00:04:02.829
 from my family to my mom and my aunt and 

00:03:59.560 --> 00:04:05.420
 both of them was like hey look at my mom so 

00:04:02.829 --> 00:04:09.700
 He puts face 

00:04:05.420 --> 00:04:09.700
 I was scared I thought I was going to scream 

00:04:09.790 --> 00:04:16.690
 because we were at a family reunion 

00:04:14.470 --> 00:04:20.560
 pretty smart from me 

00:04:16.690 --> 00:04:22.960
 show it to the middle of the round but 

00:04:20.560 --> 00:04:25.770
 nobody saw us so I got problem 

00:04:22.960 --> 00:04:25.770
 he told me 

00:04:25.830 --> 00:04:33.210
 what's wrong with you when you did it? 

00:04:29.280 --> 00:04:34.889
 I said no, I did it, so I went with 

00:04:33.210 --> 00:04:37.700
 klaus 

00:04:34.889 --> 00:04:40.940
 and so on and that's it 

00:04:37.700 --> 00:04:43.490
 books nothing else moved his head and told me 

00:04:40.940 --> 00:04:48.980
 well at least the place was clean 

00:04:43.490 --> 00:04:54.130
 I said yes was in a clean place 

00:04:48.980 --> 00:04:58.620
 everything was fine and then after that 

00:04:54.130 --> 00:05:02.370
 digested the idea I said good 

00:04:58.620 --> 00:05:05.510
 what do you think and she just flips me to 

00:05:02.370 --> 00:05:05.510
 see very serious and told me 

00:05:05.560 --> 00:05:13.889
 Well, it's nice, you already did it 

00:05:08.830 --> 00:05:13.889
 nice and I like the phrase is original 

00:05:14.860 --> 00:05:21.759
 and that's what my mom told my aunt for another 

00:05:18.580 --> 00:05:24.659
 side told me wow dt louis joke that 

00:05:21.759 --> 00:05:24.659
 father 

00:05:24.689 --> 00:05:29.969
 and as nothing else I saw her a little while 

00:05:28.709 --> 00:05:33.360
 tiny 

00:05:29.969 --> 00:05:34.889
 we could not talk any longer but if 

00:05:33.360 --> 00:05:36.599
 He told me that he was very father and that if 

00:05:34.889 --> 00:05:38.939
 sent a picture of him because he liked it 

00:05:36.599 --> 00:05:40.070
 much more than them no one else has 

00:05:38.939 --> 00:05:43.490
 viewed 

00:05:40.070 --> 00:05:47.150
 and that in my house I do not have it very 

00:05:43.490 --> 00:05:51.350
 hidden using it I bring it like that and I speak 

00:05:47.150 --> 00:05:55.100
 A lot of times I wear my bracelets like that 

00:05:51.350 --> 00:05:59.420
 wear a bracelet and as it is very 

00:05:55.100 --> 00:06:01.160
 little one almost does not notice then not 

00:05:59.420 --> 00:06:03.350
 I have no problem or until now not 

00:06:01.160 --> 00:06:07.060
 I had no problem , I'll tell you 

00:06:03.350 --> 00:06:07.060
 later when I understand 

00:06:07.120 --> 00:06:11.440
 no problem well those have been 

00:06:09.400 --> 00:06:14.729
 all the frequent questions that I 

00:06:11.440 --> 00:06:17.939
 have left on my tattoo 

00:06:14.729 --> 00:06:22.400
 is the phrase receptive and you see your mind 

00:06:17.939 --> 00:06:25.100
 of outside bernal of this that other 

00:06:22.400 --> 00:06:28.090
 in Spanish it means 

00:06:25.100 --> 00:06:31.370
 to restart your eyes or reset your eyes 

00:06:28.090 --> 00:06:35.510
 and erase your mind already in another video 

00:06:31.370 --> 00:06:38.380
 I will talk about the meaning because that would be 

00:06:35.510 --> 00:06:40.020
 this would be a very long video 

00:06:38.380 --> 00:06:43.210
 if I told you all the meaning 

00:06:40.020 --> 00:06:46.450
 then it will be for another video tell me what 

00:06:43.210 --> 00:06:48.630
 name they like more little ponies or 

00:06:46.450 --> 00:06:53.130
 you killers 

00:06:48.630 --> 00:06:56.889
 tell them on facebook this we did 

00:06:53.130 --> 00:06:58.449
 a vote and not 

00:06:56.889 --> 00:07:00.879
 not in fact these three remained 

00:06:58.449 --> 00:07:03.580
 tied everyone had a lot of votes 

00:07:00.879 --> 00:07:05.830
 for those three they were tied and 

00:07:03.580 --> 00:07:08.560
 I also love them then 

00:07:05.830 --> 00:07:11.500
