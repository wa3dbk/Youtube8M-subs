back again how it was over here in the

00:00:52.230 --> 00:00:54.410 
back again how it was over here in the
states<00:00:52.500> and<00:00:53.039> this<00:00:54.000> is<00:00:54.090> just<00:00:54.180> the<00:00:54.329> beginning

00:00:54.420 --> 00:00:57.680 
states and this is just the beginning
for<00:00:54.690> it<00:00:54.930> like<00:00:55.579> this<00:00:56.579> was<00:00:56.879> totally<00:00:57.090> unexpected

00:00:57.680 --> 00:00:57.690 
for it like this was totally unexpected

00:00:57.690 --> 00:01:00.080 
for it like this was totally unexpected
from<00:00:58.260> my<00:00:58.440> part<00:00:58.710> like<00:00:58.949> I<00:00:59.190> didn't<00:00:59.640> expect<00:00:59.850> for

00:01:00.080 --> 00:01:00.090 
from my part like I didn't expect for

00:01:00.090 --> 00:01:02.779 
from my part like I didn't expect for
them<00:01:00.449> to<00:01:00.539> pick<00:01:00.719> up<00:01:00.870> Naruto<00:01:01.109> so<00:01:01.469> fast<00:01:01.739> I<00:01:02.039> thought

00:01:02.779 --> 00:01:02.789 
them to pick up Naruto so fast I thought

00:01:02.789 --> 00:01:04.549

it<00:01:02.910> would<00:01:03.000> take<00:01:03.149> them<00:01:03.329> a<00:01:03.420> while<00:01:03.449> to<00:01:03.629> be<00:01:04.140> able<00:01:04.260> to

00:01:04.549 --> 00:01:04.559 
it would take them a while to be able to

00:01:04.559 --> 00:01:07.520 
it would take them a while to be able to
pick<00:01:04.739> a<00:01:04.799> big<00:01:05.159> show<00:01:05.309> like<00:01:05.339> this<00:01:05.640> oh<00:01:06.110> but<00:01:07.110> let<00:01:07.500> me
