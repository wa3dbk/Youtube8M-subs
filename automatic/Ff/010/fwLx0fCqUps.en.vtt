00:00:15.929 --> 00:00:21.630

00:00:18.390 --> 00:00:24.090

00:00:21.630 --> 00:00:26.039
 here today how to make a bonfire for 

00:00:24.090 --> 00:00:27.570
 some there may be easy already I have 

00:00:26.039 --> 00:00:29.970
 learned but there are a lot of people that I 

00:00:27.570 --> 00:00:32.070
 I've been browsing the net and have not yet 

00:00:29.970 --> 00:00:34.170
 I knew I could not do 

00:00:32.070 --> 00:00:36.149
 Let's go there first of all, you? 

00:00:34.170 --> 00:00:38.700
 need an ax and which one I'm in 

00:00:36.149 --> 00:00:40.920
 hand to be able to knock down a tree already 

00:00:38.700 --> 00:00:42.390
 So you have a little key there? 

00:00:40.920 --> 00:00:49.260
 will arrive at the tree will stay here 

00:00:42.390 --> 00:00:52.890
 knocking on her, let's go, right tree 

00:00:49.260 --> 00:00:54.239
 falling will ever come to the wood to 

00:00:52.890 --> 00:00:58.050
 to reinvent in which the young woman is a 

00:00:54.239 --> 00:01:00.449
 generally a wood is not a wood already 

00:00:58.050 --> 00:01:03.000
 came a wood and that for your 

00:01:00.449 --> 00:01:04.320
 inventory there you make you go and get it 

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:06.180
 including a front line that I 

00:01:04.320 --> 00:01:08.549
 I tested you, right? 

00:01:06.180 --> 00:01:11.580
 so you do the following you go 

00:01:08.549 --> 00:01:14.460
 Click if you need gasoline too. 

00:01:11.580 --> 00:01:16.470
 and hello and it has to be left then 

00:01:14.460 --> 00:01:19.229
 you will double click on gasoline 

00:01:16.470 --> 00:01:21.119
 first is asking is the mode of 

00:01:19.229 --> 00:01:24.979
 select combo item goes 

00:01:21.119 --> 00:01:27.479
 select wood beauty already then 

00:01:24.979 --> 00:01:30.420
 say you've thrown gasoline on the 

00:01:27.479 --> 00:01:34.820
 wood you will now select two 

00:01:30.420 --> 00:01:38.250
 times lighter timber and then 

00:01:34.820 --> 00:01:40.890
 This campfire is ready that more 

00:01:38.250 --> 00:01:43.640
 for when you have the 

00:01:40.890 --> 00:01:46.770
 very low body temperature is that 

00:01:43.640 --> 00:01:49.799
 below 25 degrees and a half you get to 

00:01:46.770 --> 00:01:53.520
 feel some years, right? 

00:01:49.799 --> 00:01:56.850
 from there and made a vital game then you have to 

00:01:53.520 --> 00:01:58.710
 always look for gasoline lighter and 

00:01:56.850 --> 00:02:00.600
 With that, you will 

00:01:58.710 --> 00:02:02.189
 can survive a little more 

00:02:00.600 --> 00:02:04.320
 Of course if you do not find any players 

00:02:02.189 --> 00:02:07.350

00:02:04.320 --> 00:02:09.209

00:02:07.350 --> 00:02:11.350
