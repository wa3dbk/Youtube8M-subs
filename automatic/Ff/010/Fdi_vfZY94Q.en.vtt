the rest of his team east which is in
Doubront<00:02:55.420> ought<00:02:55.690> to<00:02:55.959> take<00:02:56.109> a<00:02:56.170> plus<00:02:56.470> to<00:02:56.739> serve

00:02:57.229 --> 00:02:57.239 
Doubront ought to take a plus to serve

00:02:57.239 --> 00:02:59.970

which<00:02:58.239> takes<00:02:58.599> out<00:02:58.840> a<00:02:58.870> bit<00:02:59.230> less<00:02:59.560> than<00:02:59.739> half<00:02:59.950> of

00:02:59.970 --> 00:02:59.980 
which takes out a bit less than half of

which takes out a bit less than half of
his<00:03:00.280> health<00:03:00.569> now<00:03:01.569> we<00:03:02.109> have<00:03:02.440> no<00:03:02.680> leftover

00:03:03.180 --> 00:03:03.190 
his health now we have no leftover

00:03:03.190 --> 00:03:05.039 
his health now we have no leftover
through<00:03:03.340> covery<00:03:03.700> so<00:03:03.940> I'm<00:03:04.209> guessing<00:03:04.629> he's<00:03:05.019> a

00:03:05.039 --> 00:03:05.049 
through covery so I'm guessing he's a

00:03:05.049 --> 00:03:09.300 
through covery so I'm guessing he's a
dual<00:03:05.379> screener<00:03:05.819> be<00:03:06.819> quiz<00:03:07.389> I<00:03:07.629> clay<00:03:08.079> so<00:03:08.980> I've

00:03:09.300 --> 00:03:09.310 
dual screener be quiz I clay so I've

00:03:09.310 --> 00:03:11.580 
dual screener be quiz I clay so I've
tried<00:03:09.879> taking<00:03:10.599> him<00:03:10.720> up<00:03:10.780> with<00:03:11.019> another<00:03:11.290> serve

00:03:11.580 --> 00:03:11.590 
tried taking him up with another serve

00:03:11.590 --> 00:03:15.149 
tried taking him up with another serve
but<00:03:11.889> he<00:03:12.250> lives<00:03:12.849> barely<00:03:13.450> was<00:03:13.750> both<00:03:14.200> minimums<00:03:14.680> so

00:03:15.149 --> 00:03:15.159 
but he lives barely was both minimums so

00:03:15.159 --> 00:03:16.830 
but he lives barely was both minimums so
he<00:03:15.370> can<00:03:15.519> set<00:03:15.670> up<00:03:15.760> a<00:03:15.819> light<00:03:15.940> screen<00:03:16.209> however<00:03:16.599> I

just in case and this turns out to be

00:06:12.950 --> 00:06:14.320 
just in case and this turns out to be
really<00:06:13.190> good<00:06:13.430> because<00:06:13.460> he<00:06:13.880> goes<00:06:14.060> through<00:06:14.270> the

00:06:14.320 --> 00:06:14.330 
really good because he goes through the

00:06:14.330 --> 00:06:17.170
