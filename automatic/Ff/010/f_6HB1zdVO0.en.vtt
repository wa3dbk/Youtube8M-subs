00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:09.800
 but your day is not today went for a parcel 

00:00:03.360 --> 00:00:14.299
 yourself this is such balls ultrafire 

00:00:09.800 --> 00:00:22.850
 if interested they go zoom and 

00:00:14.299 --> 00:00:28.460
 because of the button from the phosphor in general he 

00:00:22.850 --> 00:00:33.210
 will devote a flashlight with it and will 

00:00:28.460 --> 00:00:34.820
 Adapters one for the battery here 

00:00:33.210 --> 00:00:40.890
 this type 

00:00:34.820 --> 00:00:43.260
 1850 is normal here and if without 

00:00:40.890 --> 00:00:48.539
 This adapter will be deflocked 

00:00:43.260 --> 00:00:51.989
 And also goes adapter on three batteries 

00:00:48.539 --> 00:00:55.829
 ordinary but getting so normal in 

00:00:51.989 --> 00:01:01.530
 principle let's put the batteries 

00:00:55.829 --> 00:01:05.960
 let's see if we close 

00:01:01.530 --> 00:01:05.960
 let's see already included and 

00:01:10.660 --> 00:01:20.240
 so here is the maximum solution that is she 

00:01:15.010 --> 00:01:22.790
 measured we also have a square or 

00:01:20.240 --> 00:01:25.700
 magnified it turns out a huge spot then 

00:01:22.790 --> 00:01:28.610
 If there's to take what extent that 

00:01:25.700 --> 00:01:33.020
 it is very focused on the point 

00:01:28.610 --> 00:01:36.670
 apparently stood at this flashlight number 

00:01:33.020 --> 00:01:41.600
 do a little less eat such mode from 

00:01:36.670 --> 00:01:45.740
 average minimum strobe sos well 

00:01:41.600 --> 00:01:47.060
 maximum he pulls out 

00:01:45.740 --> 00:01:50.119
 just pulled well and not 

00:01:47.060 --> 00:01:55.520
 no water scale gets out 

00:01:50.119 --> 00:02:00.670
 some shows such as ratio or 

00:01:55.520 --> 00:02:03.740
 I do not know well, even a flashlight itself 

00:02:00.670 --> 00:02:07.100
 on an amateur as they say that is for 

00:02:03.740 --> 00:02:09.550
 fishing maybe it is suitable but for 

00:02:07.100 --> 00:02:12.020
 great especially and not ride with him 

00:02:09.550 --> 00:02:15.650
 because it will or be seen very far 

00:02:12.020 --> 00:02:19.430
 but around will not be visible on or 

00:02:15.650 --> 00:02:22.459
 everything will be seen around but far well this 

00:02:19.430 --> 00:02:25.340
 doesn't see anything at all , that's why 

00:02:22.459 --> 00:02:29.500
 such a flashlight he learns for housekeeping 

00:02:25.340 --> 00:02:33.019
 probably fit these flashlights me 2 

00:02:29.500 --> 00:02:37.640
 on the second it is meaningless to tell 

00:02:33.019 --> 00:02:42.130
 because they are identical batteries with 

00:02:37.640 --> 00:02:46.790
 they went to 3 amps firm ultrafire 

00:02:42.130 --> 00:02:50.000
 Well, in principle, this capacity is less than they 

00:02:46.790 --> 00:02:52.489
 indicate well an hour to visit in 

00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:54.910
 maximum mode should thanks for 

00:02:52.489 --> 00:02:54.910
 Attention
