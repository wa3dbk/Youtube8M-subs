00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.540
 Hello everyone! Last week it was my birthday 

00:00:03.540 --> 00:00:06.900
 and I decided to buy myself a birthday present. 

00:00:06.900 --> 00:00:09.080
 I bought myself a new jacket. 

00:00:09.080 --> 00:00:12.260
 And this one arrived today. [laughing] 

00:00:12.260 --> 00:00:14.500
 As you can see, I haven't opened the package yet. 

00:00:14.562 --> 00:00:16.562
 I'm going to open it for the camera. 

00:00:16.562 --> 00:00:20.042
 So you will see my first reaction. 

00:00:21.209 --> 00:00:23.509
 I will show you how the jacket looked on the website. 

00:00:25.009 --> 00:00:28.189
 Speech bubble: This is what the jacket looked like on the website. They had these in black, purple and red diamonds. 

00:00:28.189 --> 00:00:31.249
 I hope he looks like this in real life. 

00:00:31.249 --> 00:00:34.709
 I'm going to open the package. Ready? 

00:00:34.709 --> 00:00:36.709
 Mumbling: 'oh, hopefully he is beautiful' 

00:00:40.220 --> 00:00:42.220
 I chose the purple one. 

00:00:42.220 --> 00:00:45.780
 I could choose between black, purple and red diamonds. 

00:00:45.780 --> 00:00:47.780
 Purple seemed the best. 

00:00:47.780 --> 00:00:50.920
 Sorry, wrong side! :) 

00:00:50.920 --> 00:00:55.660
 Ooh! It is a bit darker than I expected. 

00:00:55.660 --> 00:00:57.660
 I'm going to unpack it. 

00:01:00.642 --> 00:01:05.202
 Okay, it's the right size, I can already see that. 

00:01:08.100 --> 00:01:09.300
 Oh, wow! 

00:01:09.300 --> 00:01:11.760
 He's SOFT! 

00:01:11.760 --> 00:01:15.560
 Take a look now! 

00:01:19.040 --> 00:01:21.900
 See the back! That's so cool. 

00:01:21.900 --> 00:01:25.820
 It's a corset. Oh, wow! 

00:01:25.820 --> 00:01:28.340
 He is so handsome! 

00:01:28.340 --> 00:01:34.200
 See the hearts and details. 

00:01:34.200 --> 00:01:37.560
 I think it's great! 

00:01:37.560 --> 00:01:40.360
 I'm going to fit him! 

00:01:40.360 --> 00:01:43.700
 I'm so happy :) 

00:01:43.700 --> 00:01:50.240
 I thought he might look less beautiful in real life than in the photo. 

00:01:50.420 --> 00:01:56.220
 [laughs] OK, I'm going to fit him, let's see how he looks at me. 

00:01:58.340 --> 00:02:01.260
 Oh, buttons AND a zipper. 

00:02:01.260 --> 00:02:05.000
 The buttons are difficult to open. 

00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:07.000
 Sorry for my shiny face. 

00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:11.140
 There is a big spot on me, 

00:02:11.140 --> 00:02:14.640
 because it is dark outside and I wanted to make this video. 

00:02:14.640 --> 00:02:17.480
 That is warm. 

00:02:20.040 --> 00:02:23.020
 OK, so buttons and a zipper. 

00:02:23.020 --> 00:02:28.120
 Oh, he's cool inside too. 

00:02:28.120 --> 00:02:33.500
 It is from Poizen Industries (brand), purchased from Large Popmerchandising. 

00:02:33.600 --> 00:02:35.600
 I'll put it on now. 

00:02:49.620 --> 00:02:51.620
 He's a little ... 

00:02:51.620 --> 00:02:54.340
 oh no, it's not too small. 

00:02:54.340 --> 00:02:57.220
 He is short here in front. 

00:02:57.220 --> 00:03:00.720
 Wow, he is very warm, this jacket! 

00:03:00.720 --> 00:03:05.400
 Oh, they are REAL bags, take a look! 

00:03:09.240 --> 00:03:11.680
 What does he look like at the back? 

00:03:11.680 --> 00:03:14.620
 I probably have to tighten the corset ribbon. 

00:03:14.620 --> 00:03:17.300
 I'll try the hood. 

00:03:19.780 --> 00:03:21.780
 I do not see anything! :) 

00:03:24.040 --> 00:03:26.040
 [laughing] 

00:03:28.980 --> 00:03:31.660
 Sorry, I was just looking in the mirror. 

00:03:31.660 --> 00:03:34.200
 I love it! 

00:03:34.200 --> 00:03:36.200
 He is so handsome. 

00:03:42.180 --> 00:03:47.400
 A big compliment for this beautiful Alice jacket from Poizen Industries. 

00:03:47.560 --> 00:03:49.560
 I think it's beautiful! 

00:03:49.680 --> 00:03:51.240
 Thank you for looking. 

00:03:51.240 --> 00:03:53.240
 See you soon in the following video. 

00:03:53.240 --> 00:03:58.260
 I do not yet know what he is going to do but he will be great.
