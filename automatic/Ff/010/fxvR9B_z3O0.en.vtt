00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.870
 before the video start very important 

00:00:01.949 --> 00:00:05.870
 that if these talents are also on this 

00:00:03.870 --> 00:00:08.490
 you want to have the same standard 

00:00:05.870 --> 00:00:10.639
 set down that you use now 

00:00:08.490 --> 00:00:14.309
 teams download the latest ones 

00:00:10.639 --> 00:00:16.980
 now in the talents pure if you like that 

00:00:14.309 --> 00:00:18.750
 Do you want to join the video today? 

00:00:16.980 --> 00:00:20.939
 a different video today 

00:00:18.750 --> 00:00:22.800
 I for you the talents on 10 

00:00:20.939 --> 00:00:24.960
 Today, these are the ones that take over most of us 

00:00:22.800 --> 00:00:26.490
 cheaper talents before with my talent 

00:00:24.960 --> 00:00:28.050
 but I really here are the 

00:00:26.490 --> 00:00:32.369
 best what you for the least money 

00:00:28.050 --> 00:00:34.140
 that means potential over 86 

00:00:32.369 --> 00:00:36.480
 have over 87 players through all these 

00:00:34.140 --> 00:00:38.309
 potential over 87 and are not now 

00:00:36.480 --> 00:00:40.440
 as if you were worth 30 million 

00:00:38.309 --> 00:00:42.750
 I do not have to say much 

00:00:40.440 --> 00:00:43.379
 and catch up with our first 

00:00:42.750 --> 00:00:44.910
 on 

00:00:43.379 --> 00:00:46.710
 that is this mohammed sala 

00:00:44.910 --> 00:00:49.289
 if you said like me at the beginning 

00:00:46.710 --> 00:00:52.110
 then updated the transport 

00:00:49.289 --> 00:00:53.820
 is he now at chelsea and yes is 

00:00:52.110 --> 00:00:55.410
 not to have but his huge talent 

00:00:53.820 --> 00:00:57.059
 and also a very big fan of him 

00:00:55.410 --> 00:00:59.129
 before these chelsea do not switch like that 

00:00:57.059 --> 00:01:03.390
 it is known that stop 21 has a potential 

00:00:59.129 --> 00:01:06.540
 of 87 or at first strength of 77 

00:01:03.390 --> 00:01:08.909
 a very fast 92 ps so go 

00:01:06.540 --> 00:01:12.119
 and 94 ground speed also for 

00:01:08.909 --> 00:01:13.320
 that is a very interesting man 

00:01:12.119 --> 00:01:14.220
 but as you said you can first 

00:01:13.320 --> 00:01:16.170
 not wherever the chelsea is 

00:01:14.220 --> 00:01:17.600
 but then changed the other 

00:01:16.170 --> 00:01:19.890
 probably one of the best known 

00:01:17.600 --> 00:01:21.330
 after being so heavily played a new one 

00:01:19.890 --> 00:01:22.710
 school-type similar I believe two or 

00:01:21.330 --> 00:01:24.990
 scored a goal I was never again 

00:01:22.710 --> 00:01:27.150
 quite the belgian left middle field 18 

00:01:24.990 --> 00:01:29.640
 years old potential of 89 and initially 

00:01:27.150 --> 00:01:30.990
 Strength of 73 this man really hurry 

00:01:29.640 --> 00:01:32.579
 should look at if you in a 

00:01:30.990 --> 00:01:33.960
 slightly weaker team plays there can 

00:01:32.579 --> 00:01:36.299
 you might offer a player 

00:01:33.960 --> 00:01:38.159
 to exchange because the man calling for 

00:01:36.299 --> 00:01:40.049
 you're already 65 for him you can 

00:01:38.159 --> 00:01:41.280
 probably about the 45 and get 

00:01:40.049 --> 00:01:43.229
 if he still has a player on it 

00:01:41.280 --> 00:01:44.850
 knocked 30's and maybe in two 

00:01:43.229 --> 00:01:47.880
 million marks and has been good too 

00:01:44.850 --> 00:01:48.930
 and as I said with 73 has is yes 

00:01:47.880 --> 00:01:50.189
 ever really good at four places 

00:01:48.930 --> 00:01:53.189
 weak fusion as I said 

00:01:50.189 --> 00:01:55.079
 potential of 89 is absolutely not 

00:01:53.189 --> 00:01:57.030
 wrong next probably 

00:01:55.079 --> 00:01:59.600
 also an extremely well known one of the very often 

00:01:57.030 --> 00:02:02.640
 his rounds are saxerriet bakali 

00:01:59.600 --> 00:02:04.530
 at first strong of 72 is so in these 

00:02:02.640 --> 00:02:07.259
 are weaker than yes only has to be too 

00:02:04.530 --> 00:02:09.539
 only a potential of 88 4 star 

00:02:07.259 --> 00:02:11.430
 weak foot failed start field sales 

00:02:09.539 --> 00:02:12.819
 effects is also very fast 

00:02:11.430 --> 00:02:14.319
 man and generally too 

00:02:12.819 --> 00:02:15.700
 popular with youtube so as a 

00:02:14.319 --> 00:02:17.620
 bit the mainstream type everyone 

00:02:15.700 --> 00:02:19.150
 knows naturally well and develops 

00:02:17.620 --> 00:02:20.650
 It is also very good for FIFA because he 

00:02:19.150 --> 00:02:21.280
 very fast is moving and so on 

00:02:20.650 --> 00:02:24.280
 and so on 

00:02:21.280 --> 00:02:26.019
 Definitely a player you look at 

00:02:24.280 --> 00:02:27.730
 then consider a giant talent 

00:02:26.019 --> 00:02:29.200
 last year's actual is 

00:02:27.730 --> 00:02:31.180
 Almost for a long-standing strength 

00:02:29.200 --> 00:02:32.579
 Luke's person is still the key 

00:02:31.180 --> 00:02:37.900
 but has already given a strength of 

00:02:32.579 --> 00:02:40.329
 77 a potential of 88 and yes how 

00:02:37.900 --> 00:02:42.040
 also said a whole not so often 

00:02:40.329 --> 00:02:43.329
 used as but last year 

00:02:42.040 --> 00:02:45.700
 he was barely even with chelsea 

00:02:43.329 --> 00:02:48.040
 has played relatively popular 

00:02:45.700 --> 00:02:49.780
 somehow to get the yes because he was 

00:02:48.040 --> 00:02:50.829
 still very cheap now would have 

00:02:49.780 --> 00:02:53.319
 and its award to 

00:02:50.829 --> 00:02:56.139
 then we have the good brother too 

00:02:53.319 --> 00:02:57.430
 very interesting man I if you 

00:02:56.139 --> 00:02:58.689
 Of course you are not in it 

00:02:57.430 --> 00:03:00.310
 I had my fifa 12 times 

00:02:58.689 --> 00:03:03.129
 career mode or fifa circle calw 

00:03:00.310 --> 00:03:04.449
 lithuania brought huge talent is 

00:03:03.129 --> 00:03:05.909
 but unfortunately also to galatasaray 

00:03:04.449 --> 00:03:09.760
 changed 

00:03:05.909 --> 00:03:13.810
 and yes 477 arrives too on 10 88's 

00:03:09.760 --> 00:03:18.459
 very very very similar to says 

00:03:13.810 --> 00:03:20.049
 But tully bakali is a bit 

00:03:18.459 --> 00:03:21.699
 unknown also has four stars weak 

00:03:20.049 --> 00:03:23.709
 special four stars move up 

00:03:21.699 --> 00:03:25.199
 So the right way to work 

00:03:23.709 --> 00:03:27.250
 i also like to celebrate a lot 

00:03:25.199 --> 00:03:30.430
 and because he is not such a bakali 

00:03:27.250 --> 00:03:31.750
 mainstream guy is next hannah 

00:03:30.430 --> 00:03:32.739
 in the middle right middle so 

00:03:31.750 --> 00:03:35.079
 probably one of the 

00:03:32.739 --> 00:03:37.090
 Unknown and I recommend you 

00:03:35.079 --> 00:03:39.400
 very much because it probably too 

00:03:37.090 --> 00:03:42.819
 the cheapest is 19 years old 

00:03:39.400 --> 00:03:46.629
 plays for ud almeira in the spanish 

00:03:42.819 --> 00:03:49.479
 league and 74 initially strengthen 89 potential 

00:03:46.629 --> 00:03:50.709
 it is definitely strong and for that 

00:03:49.479 --> 00:03:52.120
 that he is really unknown and me 

00:03:50.709 --> 00:03:54.699
 do not know exactly how much you have him 

00:03:52.120 --> 00:03:59.049
 he can be lent 

00:03:54.699 --> 00:04:00.489
 of liverpool of course and i can 

00:03:59.049 --> 00:04:02.409
 Highly recommend is a very strong one 

00:04:00.489 --> 00:04:04.810
 but you have to play fast 

00:04:02.409 --> 00:04:06.280
 try it because otherwise it will be very 

00:04:04.810 --> 00:04:08.349
 very expensive develops very fast 

00:04:06.280 --> 00:04:10.569
 then the last one very well known 

00:04:08.349 --> 00:04:12.609
 marquinhos the defenders 19 years 

00:04:10.569 --> 00:04:15.430
 young medium middle working rates had 

00:04:12.609 --> 00:04:18.039
 initially stood at 78 and potential of 

00:04:15.430 --> 00:04:19.389
 89 all these potentials usually fall 

00:04:18.039 --> 00:04:21.400
 much higher if you then 

00:04:19.389 --> 00:04:23.650
 Every game I like to play 

00:04:21.400 --> 00:04:25.550
 mostly 34 points above the potential 

00:04:23.650 --> 00:04:27.319
 So be the most relaxed here 

00:04:25.550 --> 00:04:28.699
 90s range all the talents you 

00:04:27.319 --> 00:04:31.099
 You are very likely to see them 

00:04:28.699 --> 00:04:33.650
 90s area land if you longer with 

00:04:31.099 --> 00:04:35.360
 As I said, we play that now 

00:04:33.650 --> 00:04:36.830
 first some cheaper talents 

00:04:35.360 --> 00:04:39.409
 Of course the costs are still very high 

00:04:36.830 --> 00:04:41.330
 but on the other hand they are too 

00:04:39.409 --> 00:04:43.039
 now not so great winker to then has 

00:04:41.330 --> 00:04:43.729
 or this quite in talente the already so 

00:04:43.039 --> 00:04:45.849
 are strong 

00:04:43.729 --> 00:04:48.110
 There you are one step below 

00:04:45.849 --> 00:04:49.280
 that was already from the video 

00:04:48.110 --> 00:04:51.169
 I hope I have it now very nice 

00:04:49.280 --> 00:04:53.960
 fast and complains klapp klapp made 

00:04:51.169 --> 00:04:55.419
 because yes that always stresses me with 

00:04:53.960 --> 00:04:57.590
 talents so much rum la 

00:04:55.419 --> 00:04:58.759
 if you please ladder and 

00:04:57.590 --> 00:04:59.270
 maybe an abo would be great too 

00:04:58.759 --> 00:05:01.159
 looking forward 

00:04:59.270 --> 00:05:02.419
 because many people are watching this 

00:05:01.159 --> 00:05:03.949
 probably not on my channel 

00:05:02.419 --> 00:05:05.870
 Subscribe or know my channel even 

00:05:03.949 --> 00:05:07.400
 not so as i said i hope that 

00:05:05.870 --> 00:05:08.389
 Please stay tuned for a while 

00:05:07.400 --> 00:05:09.949
 the next time will come 

00:05:08.389 --> 00:05:11.449
 the fastest talents there 

00:05:09.949 --> 00:05:13.039
 out there and then somehow 

00:05:11.449 --> 00:05:14.930
 talents the less than five million 

00:05:13.039 --> 00:05:16.580
 In any case, it can be very 

00:05:14.930 --> 00:05:17.900
 Much for you when you play career 

00:05:16.580 --> 00:05:21.219
 what I am from us at first 

00:05:17.900 --> 00:05:21.219
