00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.710
 for this design I will start with this 

00:00:02.490 --> 00:00:08.930
 enamel 

00:00:04.710 --> 00:00:08.930
 it's a maybelline blue 

00:00:11.460 --> 00:00:15.020
 it's called pjanic blue 

00:00:15.670 --> 00:00:20.230
 but I want it more intense then 

00:00:18.460 --> 00:00:24.910
 I'll put 

00:00:20.230 --> 00:00:28.630
 this other blue of this brand 

00:00:24.910 --> 00:00:30.460
 it's the color russia in blue 

00:00:28.630 --> 00:00:36.809
 I shut up and the video was broken 

00:00:30.460 --> 00:00:36.809
 it is a very beautiful marine blue very intense 

00:00:37.079 --> 00:00:42.130
 this that I'll put up here 

00:00:40.160 --> 00:00:45.300
 so that it is 

00:00:42.130 --> 00:00:45.300
 and very intense 

00:00:46.570 --> 00:00:50.700
 we will wait for it to dry out a 

00:00:48.250 --> 00:00:50.700
 moment 

00:00:50.770 --> 00:00:55.250
 to do the design 

00:00:53.810 --> 00:00:59.500
 as the holidays are approaching 

00:00:55.250 --> 00:01:03.200
 decembrinas I decided to use this type of 

00:00:59.500 --> 00:01:06.550
 enamel to make the design is the brand 

00:01:03.200 --> 00:01:06.550
 nana coconut 

00:01:09.630 --> 00:01:15.329
 and this type of frost stands out very 

00:01:12.630 --> 00:01:18.180
 nice in dark enamels the idea of 

00:01:15.329 --> 00:01:20.870
 this design is that it looks like 

00:01:18.180 --> 00:01:24.700
 it was snowed 

00:01:20.870 --> 00:01:24.700
 and we're going to give him two passes 

00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:28.740
 to highlight the frost 

00:01:33.400 --> 00:01:37.810
 and that's how simple this design is going to be 

00:01:35.920 --> 00:01:40.840
 Now I'm going to show you how they are 

00:01:37.810 --> 00:01:43.770
 the complete nails and you can also 

00:01:40.840 --> 00:01:43.770
 leave photography
