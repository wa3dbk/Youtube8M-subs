was<00:00:10.530> and<00:00:10.920> if<00:00:11.309> I<00:00:11.460> had<00:00:11.610> to<00:00:11.730> sum<00:00:12.000> it<00:00:12.030> up<00:00:12.269> to<00:00:12.540> a

00:00:12.560 --> 00:00:12.570 
was and if I had to sum it up to a

00:00:12.570 --> 00:00:15.140 
was and if I had to sum it up to a
student<00:00:13.080> I<00:00:13.139> say<00:00:13.440> that<00:00:14.280> the<00:00:14.490> modern<00:00:14.880> stuff

00:00:15.140 --> 00:00:15.150

student I say that the modern stuff
there's<00:00:15.420> not<00:00:15.630> a<00:00:15.660> whole<00:00:15.990> lot<00:00:16.230> of<00:00:16.260> them

00:00:16.900 --> 00:00:16.910 
there's not a whole lot of them

00:00:16.910 --> 00:00:19.310

00:00:31.640 --> 00:00:31.650 
know what it's like I mean if everything

00:00:31.650 --> 00:00:33.889 
know what it's like I mean if everything
is<00:00:32.009> pushed<00:00:32.369> and<00:00:32.610> pulled<00:00:32.880> and<00:00:33.210> squeezed<00:00:33.540> and

00:00:36.020 --> 00:00:36.030 
finesse and everything and it's a huge

00:00:36.030 --> 00:00:38.360 
finesse and everything and it's a huge
workout<00:00:36.540> compared<00:00:37.410> to<00:00:37.559> a<00:00:37.590> more<00:00:37.860> modern<00:00:38.190> piece

00:00:38.360 --> 00:00:38.370 
workout compared to a more modern piece

workout compared to a more modern piece
of<00:00:38.520> music<00:00:38.820> where<00:00:38.940> you<00:00:38.969> play<00:00:39.180> the<00:00:39.239> low<00:00:39.450> legato

00:00:42.020 --> 00:00:42.030 
where it's a lot of fast picking and and

00:00:42.030 --> 00:00:44.869 
where it's a lot of fast picking and and
I<00:00:42.329> kind<00:00:42.780> of<00:00:42.840> miss<00:00:43.050> it<00:00:43.079> because<00:00:43.649> sometimes<00:00:44.190> you

00:00:44.869 --> 00:00:44.879 
I kind of miss it because sometimes you

00:00:44.879 --> 00:00:47.510
