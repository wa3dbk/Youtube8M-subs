00:05:57.689 --> 00:05:57.699 
same using the phone we tested graphics

00:05:57.699 --> 00:05:59.820

out<00:06:00.129> the<00:06:00.190> ACC<00:06:00.819> 1<00:06:01.060> but<00:06:01.569> the<00:06:01.659> results<00:06:02.020> were<00:06:02.139> so

00:06:02.430 --> 00:06:02.440 
out the ACC 1 but the results were so

out the ACC 1 but the results were so
close<00:06:02.770> it<00:06:03.190> was<00:06:03.310> pretty<00:06:03.550> much<00:06:03.729> negligible<00:06:04.150> now

00:06:04.980 --> 00:06:04.990
