00:00:04.640 --> 00:00:08.599
 hello to all and welcome 

00:00:06.750 --> 00:00:10.440
 on indymac for a new preview 

00:00:08.599 --> 00:00:13.139
 today I'm going to talk to you about 

00:00:10.440 --> 00:00:15.389
 franken john a game still in 

00:00:13.139 --> 00:00:16.650
 kickstarter so he's in full 

00:00:15.389 --> 00:00:18.090
 crowdfunding they ask 

00:00:16.650 --> 00:00:19.770
 currently thirty thousand pounds of what 

00:00:18.090 --> 00:00:22.050
 to make a huge library 

00:00:19.770 --> 00:00:22.949
 yes a joke a timeless joke I 

00:00:22.050 --> 00:00:24.449
 know the shabby 

00:00:22.949 --> 00:00:26.400
 we did it every time but we are 

00:00:24.449 --> 00:00:29.189
 we're assuming and so currently 

00:00:26.400 --> 00:00:32.009
 games have harvested almost a third on 

00:00:29.189 --> 00:00:33.540
 will say the desired amount in there that in 

00:00:32.009 --> 00:00:35.640
 do what we are going to do well is that 

00:00:33.540 --> 00:00:36.510
 I will introduce you this little game so 

00:00:35.640 --> 00:00:39.660
 frank and john 

00:00:36.510 --> 00:00:42.540
 a rogue like with some little ones 

00:00:39.660 --> 00:00:44.520
 action aspects you'll see a little 

00:00:42.540 --> 00:00:46.379
 side manigod fault zac but without tears 

00:00:44.520 --> 00:00:48.450
 in fact we're going to run like this are his 

00:00:46.379 --> 00:00:50.010
 skull that corresponds to everything 

00:00:48.450 --> 00:00:52.079
 finally makes a skull match 

00:00:50.010 --> 00:00:53.039
 quite in the background of the game I 

00:00:52.079 --> 00:00:54.149
 will explain to you but before that I 

00:00:53.039 --> 00:00:56.760
 explains a little bit about how it works 

00:00:54.149 --> 00:00:58.440
 then play a stick to move a 

00:00:56.760 --> 00:01:00.960
 other stick to send like that his 

00:00:58.440 --> 00:01:03.539
 head that is held by huge chain bet 

00:01:00.960 --> 00:01:05.129
 I can also jump if I want 

00:01:03.539 --> 00:01:06.810
 so that can help to make 

00:01:05.129 --> 00:01:08.490
 some phases of small platform 

00:01:06.810 --> 00:01:10.229
 for example there yes I'm in a big 

00:01:08.490 --> 00:01:11.670
 level and actually in the video of 

00:01:10.229 --> 00:01:13.979
 presentation of crowdfunding 

00:01:11.670 --> 00:01:15.180
 we see a moment at the level where we are going 

00:01:13.979 --> 00:01:16.290
 from platform to platform by jumping 

00:01:15.180 --> 00:01:16.650
 so I guess we'll have to do 

00:01:16.290 --> 00:01:19.020
 gaffe 

00:01:16.650 --> 00:01:20.880
 except that their attention all dead is 

00:01:19.020 --> 00:01:23.310
 permanent so a regret case this is 

00:01:20.880 --> 00:01:24.630
 pretty violent and sim and the cost of this 

00:01:23.310 --> 00:01:26.070
 point of view there if you die you 

00:01:24.630 --> 00:01:27.900
 started from the beginning so he's going 

00:01:26.070 --> 00:01:29.189
 have to pay attention at the top of 

00:01:27.900 --> 00:01:31.020
 the screen see the life that is indicated 

00:01:29.189 --> 00:01:32.520
 I also have a number of pieces of 

00:01:31.020 --> 00:01:33.780
 resource points I'm going 

00:01:32.520 --> 00:01:34.799
 recovering would actually be there I 

00:01:33.780 --> 00:01:37.259
 of luck I can even maybe 

00:01:34.799 --> 00:01:39.030
 recover from health and therefore the goal 

00:01:37.259 --> 00:01:41.159
 will kill 

00:01:39.030 --> 00:01:42.659
 all the enemies that there are in 

00:01:41.159 --> 00:01:44.250
 this map so that's what you 

00:01:42.659 --> 00:01:47.100
 see wrote on the bottom right of the screen 

00:01:44.250 --> 00:01:49.110
 currently it remains 53 the level that 

00:01:47.100 --> 00:01:51.270
 I show you it's the one from where there 

00:01:49.110 --> 00:01:53.159
 I would have sacred blow there level 

00:01:51.270 --> 00:01:55.680
 that I'm showing you this is the one who is 

00:01:53.159 --> 00:01:57.180
 so in the demo of the game that is 

00:01:55.680 --> 00:01:59.549
 moreover available on the page which 

00:01:57.180 --> 00:02:01.170
 kickstarter installs sorry but also 

00:01:59.549 --> 00:02:03.060
 on the site if you want to play you 

00:02:01.170 --> 00:02:05.520
 can yes yes for once this is 

00:02:03.060 --> 00:02:07.950
 possible without paying or nothing at all 

00:02:05.520 --> 00:02:09.060
 to connect access no stuff and 

00:02:07.950 --> 00:02:10.319
 so well you'll see that it's 

00:02:09.060 --> 00:02:11.280
 a demo that's pretty short but who 

00:02:10.319 --> 00:02:13.110
 lets get a little account 

00:02:11.280 --> 00:02:14.970
 what will the game look like then 

00:02:13.110 --> 00:02:17.720
 attention attention big tweezers 

00:02:14.970 --> 00:02:19.760
 still it's as always 

00:02:17.720 --> 00:02:22.430
 in the context of participatory projects 

00:02:19.760 --> 00:02:23.870
 of the prototype and therefore of the bah nothing 

00:02:22.430 --> 00:02:25.730
 is not done what is to say that there you 

00:02:23.870 --> 00:02:27.470
 have the game just raw as it was 

00:02:25.730 --> 00:02:29.300
 imagined by the creator 

00:02:27.470 --> 00:02:30.680
 that is to say a game in which we 

00:02:29.300 --> 00:02:32.140
 balance his head but after all that 

00:02:30.680 --> 00:02:34.580
 is technical graph 

00:02:32.140 --> 00:02:37.550
 even from a content level point of view 

00:02:34.580 --> 00:02:39.560
 design and or nothing nothing has been going 

00:02:37.550 --> 00:02:41.890
 say engraved in the rock 

00:02:39.560 --> 00:02:45.710
 oh my god this horrible song but 

00:02:41.890 --> 00:02:47.150
 nothing is like nothing is fixed and 

00:02:45.710 --> 00:02:48.950
 so there will still be probably 

00:02:47.150 --> 00:02:51.170
 big changes or so here I took 

00:02:48.950 --> 00:02:52.910
 I really took very very expensive then 

00:02:51.170 --> 00:02:55.880
 I hope I will work and masisi to 

00:02:52.910 --> 00:02:56.900
 hula or it stinks that stinks death does not 

00:02:55.880 --> 00:02:57.950
 listened to it's okay I'll try 

00:02:56.900 --> 00:03:00.170
 to iron from above then the 

00:02:57.950 --> 00:03:01.160
 problem is that wait i'm going 

00:03:00.170 --> 00:03:01.850
 try to go to the boss at least 

00:03:01.160 --> 00:03:05.660
 story to show it to you 

00:03:01.850 --> 00:03:07.340
 go hop go hop go hop here's where 

00:03:05.660 --> 00:03:08.540
 was waiting for her because he wants some 

00:03:07.340 --> 00:03:09.980
 wrong and go in your foot my there there 

00:03:08.540 --> 00:03:11.900
 had the bosc was up then the 

00:03:09.980 --> 00:03:13.400
 problem is that in my computer is 

00:03:11.900 --> 00:03:14.959
 pretty capricious so if I do yes I 

00:03:13.400 --> 00:03:16.940
 believe that aaa if it's good it works 

00:03:14.959 --> 00:03:19.340
 than on another version that I have the 

00:03:16.940 --> 00:03:21.350
 restart does not work 36 15 

00:03:19.340 --> 00:03:23.239
 my life and so here is a proto 

00:03:21.350 --> 00:03:24.980
 so it's true we still have nothing 

00:03:23.239 --> 00:03:26.060
 final game so be still 

00:03:24.980 --> 00:03:27.230
 indulgent but it's true that two vases 

00:03:26.060 --> 00:03:28.489
 it may please all people 

00:03:27.230 --> 00:03:30.890
 who are fans of rob blake and who 

00:03:28.489 --> 00:03:33.230
 want something maybe a little more in 

00:03:30.890 --> 00:03:34.489
 3d and after we remain to see what will be 

00:03:33.230 --> 00:03:35.570
 made in terms of improvements 

00:03:34.489 --> 00:03:38.060
 particular graphics from a point of view 

00:03:35.570 --> 00:03:39.320
 visual effects with I love you to games 

00:03:38.060 --> 00:03:40.910
 of colors of the light play of this 

00:03:39.320 --> 00:03:42.650
 kind of things there but we feel when 

00:03:40.910 --> 00:03:43.640
 even a little cartoon side and besides 

00:03:42.650 --> 00:03:46.040
 when I see this game I tell myself that in 

00:03:43.640 --> 00:03:47.739
 cell shading and will make it even better but 

00:03:46.040 --> 00:03:48.950
 that's just an appreciation 

00:03:47.739 --> 00:03:51.530
 personal 

00:03:48.950 --> 00:03:53.710
 short if not so from a point of view of 

00:03:51.530 --> 00:03:56.500
 scenario then you have to know that 

00:03:53.710 --> 00:03:58.750
 we embody franck a junkie and the 

00:03:56.500 --> 00:04:00.760
 creature of a dark scientists whose 

00:03:58.750 --> 00:04:03.100
 I lost the name because I just 

00:04:00.760 --> 00:04:03.880
 remind me even cengic too nothing wait 

00:04:03.100 --> 00:04:05.080
 just my anti dry 

00:04:03.880 --> 00:04:07.600
 Here you hop there not have me miss 

00:04:05.080 --> 00:04:10.510
 aulas wait and I do anything 

00:04:07.600 --> 00:04:11.980
 I do absolutely anything 

00:04:10.510 --> 00:04:13.150
 will still die in atrocious 

00:04:11.980 --> 00:04:17.470
 suffering but it does not matter 

00:04:13.150 --> 00:04:18.880
 and so here are the creatures of the doctor I 

00:04:17.470 --> 00:04:19.870
 will get there doctor armin that's it 

00:04:18.880 --> 00:04:22.360
 the more I knew there was something 

00:04:19.870 --> 00:04:23.980
 with 2 how the attacked titans and 

00:04:22.360 --> 00:04:25.450
 so doctor amine who is crazy 

00:04:23.980 --> 00:04:27.700
 furious who basically would take 

00:04:25.450 --> 00:04:28.900
 parts of animals damaged and then the 

00:04:27.700 --> 00:04:29.920
 combined and then there actually we are in 

00:04:28.900 --> 00:04:32.170
 the cemetery of all his creations 

00:04:29.920 --> 00:04:34.750
 more or less missed I have the impression is 

00:04:32.170 --> 00:04:39.640
 so what will basically justify a little 

00:04:34.750 --> 00:04:41.470
 the dirlo the weird touch that can 

00:04:39.640 --> 00:04:43.810
 have the different monsters you 

00:04:41.470 --> 00:04:44.950
 go cross in this game then there is 

00:04:43.810 --> 00:04:47.110
 has several types sent the body to 

00:04:44.950 --> 00:04:48.270
 remote body and all that there of this 

00:04:47.110 --> 00:04:49.820
 point of view there one 

00:04:48.270 --> 00:04:52.380
 we have here three big types of enemies 

00:04:49.820 --> 00:04:53.580
 that we see and otherwise I would like 

00:04:52.380 --> 00:04:54.510
 that you show the boss a good time 

00:04:53.580 --> 00:04:56.430
 for all but I will not go there 

00:04:54.510 --> 00:04:57.990
 to arrive I will not get there actually 

00:04:56.430 --> 00:04:59.790
 I think the game does not want that 

00:04:57.990 --> 00:05:01.200
 must be that too the other little detail 

00:04:59.790 --> 00:05:02.220
 which is important is that on the ground 

00:05:01.200 --> 00:05:04.080
 at the evenings that there are traps 

00:05:02.220 --> 00:05:05.520
 you have to be careful and the other 

00:05:04.080 --> 00:05:07.080
 even more important is that 

00:05:05.520 --> 00:05:08.310
 Bin according to that can be 

00:05:07.080 --> 00:05:08.730
 appreciate for example in a manning at 

00:05:08.310 --> 00:05:10.639
 Fisac 

00:05:08.730 --> 00:05:13.129
 in this game we 

00:05:10.639 --> 00:05:14.659
 we will have improvements for our 

00:05:13.129 --> 00:05:16.999
 character that we will be able to recover 

00:05:14.659 --> 00:05:19.009
 who will be in the form of new heads 

00:05:16.999 --> 00:05:20.150
 in fact both new helmets by 

00:05:19.009 --> 00:05:21.919
 example a helmet shaped turtle 

00:05:20.150 --> 00:05:23.689
 to be able to protect from under when 

00:05:21.919 --> 00:05:25.340
 we are under the fire of enemies or 

00:05:23.689 --> 00:05:26.659
 a helmet throws flames for example 

00:05:25.340 --> 00:05:29.150
 here to improve your attacks 

00:05:26.659 --> 00:05:31.699
 in short, there are a lot of things planned 

00:05:29.150 --> 00:05:32.719
 this side and it can be pretty good 

00:05:31.699 --> 00:05:34.009
 can be really not bad after good 

00:05:32.719 --> 00:05:35.659
 for sure I will not either 

00:05:34.009 --> 00:05:36.949
 soft lying for me as she has it 

00:05:35.659 --> 00:05:38.719
 game that it's not good enough 

00:05:36.949 --> 00:05:41.689
 obviously it's missing a lot of things 

00:05:38.719 --> 00:05:43.340
 would ld web content 

00:05:41.689 --> 00:05:46.219
 level design is a little bit and 

00:05:43.340 --> 00:05:47.539
 then maybe a little less of actually 

00:05:46.219 --> 00:05:48.620
 remove that impression from arriving in 

00:05:47.539 --> 00:05:50.060
 an area where there are plenty of enemies but 

00:05:48.620 --> 00:05:52.009
 which are not necessarily put away 

00:05:50.060 --> 00:05:53.960
 see there we have more the impression to have 

00:05:52.009 --> 00:05:56.060
 a level done on a little editor 

00:05:53.960 --> 00:05:57.379
 quickly and so I hope that from this 

00:05:56.060 --> 00:05:58.310
 point of view there it will be much better 

00:05:57.379 --> 00:06:00.590
 in the final version but in any case 

00:05:58.310 --> 00:06:01.699
 basic there is a little potential that 

00:06:00.590 --> 00:06:03.050
 can be nice we are left to see what 

00:06:01.699 --> 00:06:05.509
 that it can give is anyway it 

00:06:03.050 --> 00:06:07.460
 will have to be funded in 

00:06:05.509 --> 00:06:08.900
 his kickstarter campaign and so that comes 

00:06:07.460 --> 00:06:10.639
 it depends on you among others but 

00:06:08.900 --> 00:06:12.949
 also other people and so that I you 

00:06:10.639 --> 00:06:14.120
 lets you make your decision even 

00:06:12.949 --> 00:06:16.279
 one in any case now what is sure 

00:06:14.120 --> 00:06:17.719
 is that frankenstein and well you 

00:06:16.279 --> 00:06:19.699
 know him and so on this and well 

00:06:17.719 --> 00:06:21.889
 listen I'll I'll leave you and 

00:06:19.699 --> 00:06:23.599
 I hope this little video of 

00:06:21.889 --> 00:06:24.919
 presentation will have pleased you are told
