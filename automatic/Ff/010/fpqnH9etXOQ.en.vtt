00:01:24.230 --> 00:01:24.240 
I think this costume took it took a

00:01:24.240 --> 00:01:26.390 
I think this costume took it took a
little<00:01:24.450> over<00:01:24.750> three<00:01:24.990> months<00:01:25.140> it<00:01:26.009> was<00:01:26.130> a<00:01:26.159> lot<00:01:26.369> of

00:01:26.390 --> 00:01:26.400 
little over three months it was a lot of

00:01:26.400 --> 00:01:28.850

00:01:46.639 --> 00:01:46.649 
that's round that means there's a

00:01:46.649 --> 00:01:48.319 
that's round that means there's a
rectangle<00:01:47.250> inside<00:01:47.579> so<00:01:47.909> you<00:01:47.970> make<00:01:48.210> the

00:01:48.319 --> 00:01:48.329 
rectangle inside so you make the

00:01:48.329 --> 00:01:51.620 
rectangle inside so you make the
rectangle<00:01:48.649> and<00:01:49.649> then<00:01:49.770> add<00:01:49.829> on<00:01:50.340> to<00:01:50.549> it<00:01:50.579> think<00:01:51.540> of

00:01:51.620 --> 00:01:51.630 
rectangle and then add on to it think of

00:01:51.630 --> 00:01:54.490 
rectangle and then add on to it think of
it<00:01:51.810> as<00:01:51.960> a<00:01:52.229> simple<00:01:52.770> form<00:01:53.040> and<00:01:53.430> not<00:01:53.700> the<00:01:53.759> complete

00:01:54.490 --> 00:01:54.500 
it as a simple form and not the complete

00:01:54.500 --> 00:01:57.649 
it as a simple form and not the complete
piece<00:01:55.500> or<00:01:55.860> you<00:01:55.920> it<00:01:56.640> can<00:01:56.820> be<00:01:56.969> intimidating<00:01:57.149> I

00:01:57.649 --> 00:01:57.659 
piece or you it can be intimidating I

00:01:57.659 --> 00:01:59.990 
piece or you it can be intimidating I
think<00:01:58.229> it's<00:01:58.380> a<00:01:58.439> bit<00:01:58.560> of<00:01:58.649> an<00:01:58.740> art<00:01:58.920> form<00:01:58.979> to<00:01:59.340> do<00:01:59.880> it

00:01:59.990 --> 00:02:00.000 
think it's a bit of an art form to do it

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:02.359 
think it's a bit of an art form to do it
right<00:02:00.180> I<00:02:00.930> think<00:02:01.290> it<00:02:01.560> can<00:02:01.680> be<00:02:01.710> done<00:02:01.829> very

00:02:02.359 --> 00:02:02.369 
right I think it can be done very

00:02:02.369 --> 00:02:05.240 
right I think it can be done very
sloppily<00:02:02.850> if<00:02:03.710> somebody<00:02:04.710> doesn't<00:02:04.860> take<00:02:05.100> their

00:02:05.240 --> 00:02:05.250 
sloppily if somebody doesn't take their

00:02:05.250 --> 00:02:07.249 
sloppily if somebody doesn't take their
time<00:02:05.490> but<00:02:05.850> just<00:02:06.000> do<00:02:06.210> it<00:02:06.240> out<00:02:06.600> of<00:02:06.689> the<00:02:06.780> material

00:02:07.249 --> 00:02:07.259 
time but just do it out of the material

00:02:07.259 --> 00:02:10.080 
time but just do it out of the material
and<00:02:07.860> you're<00:02:08.039> sitting<00:02:08.310> down<00:02:08.340> and<00:02:08.520> doing

00:02:10.080 --> 00:02:10.090 
and you're sitting down and doing

00:02:10.090 --> 00:02:11.640 
and you're sitting down and doing
I<00:02:10.119> think<00:02:10.599> you<00:02:10.689> should<00:02:10.840> take<00:02:10.989> the<00:02:11.140> time<00:02:11.349> and

00:02:11.640 --> 00:02:11.650 
I think you should take the time and

00:02:11.650 --> 00:02:15.060 
I think you should take the time and
make<00:02:11.920> it<00:02:12.310> as<00:02:12.519> good<00:02:12.670> as<00:02:12.790> you<00:02:12.909> can
