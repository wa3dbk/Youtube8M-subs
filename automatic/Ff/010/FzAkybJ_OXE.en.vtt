00:01:31.760 --> 00:01:31.770 
where you can download this for 64-bit

00:01:31.770 --> 00:01:37.280 
where you can download this for 64-bit
or<00:01:31.890> 32-bit<00:01:34.310> windows<00:01:35.310> can<00:01:36.150> be<00:01:36.180> XP<00:01:36.659> vista<00:01:37.110> or

00:01:37.280 --> 00:01:37.290 
or 32-bit windows can be XP vista or

00:01:37.290 --> 00:01:40.490 
or 32-bit windows can be XP vista or
seven<00:01:38.220> so<00:01:39.030> you<00:01:39.210> just<00:01:39.360> have<00:01:39.540> to<00:01:39.630> get<00:01:39.750> 32-bit<00:01:40.470> or

00:01:40.490 --> 00:01:40.500 
seven so you just have to get 32-bit or

00:01:40.500 --> 00:01:42.679 
seven so you just have to get 32-bit or
64-bit<00:01:40.799> right<00:01:41.670> so<00:01:42.060> it<00:01:42.180> says<00:01:42.210> it's<00:01:42.540> been

00:01:42.679 --> 00:01:42.689 
64-bit right so it says it's been

00:01:42.689 --> 00:01:44.620 
64-bit right so it says it's been
