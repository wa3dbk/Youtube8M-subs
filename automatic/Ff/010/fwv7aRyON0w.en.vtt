for instance let's you said n-bit as an
example<00:02:51.950> I<00:02:52.310> really<00:02:52.910> could<00:02:53.120> admire<00:02:53.450> the<00:02:53.720> jokes

00:02:54.009 --> 00:02:54.019 
example I really could admire the jokes

00:02:54.019 --> 00:02:55.810 
example I really could admire the jokes
structure<00:02:54.620> and<00:02:54.769> how<00:02:54.860> they<00:02:55.010> build<00:02:55.250> it<00:02:55.489> and<00:02:55.730> then

00:02:55.810 --> 00:02:55.820 
structure and how they build it and then

00:02:55.820 --> 00:02:57.970 
structure and how they build it and then
they<00:02:56.030> go<00:02:56.299> there<00:02:56.630> but<00:02:57.200> they<00:02:57.320> land<00:02:57.590> the<00:02:57.769> joke

00:02:57.970 --> 00:02:57.980 
they go there but they land the joke

00:02:57.980 --> 00:03:00.160 
they go there but they land the joke
because<00:02:58.190> it's<00:02:58.489> clever<00:02:58.730> it's<00:02:59.030> new<00:02:59.209> it's<00:02:59.510> a<00:02:59.600> joke

00:03:00.160 --> 00:03:00.170 
because it's clever it's new it's a joke

00:03:00.170 --> 00:03:02.470 
because it's clever it's new it's a joke
we<00:03:00.320> haven't<00:03:00.590> seen<00:03:00.769> before<00:03:00.980> and<00:03:01.459> I<00:03:02.120> think<00:03:02.209> it's

00:03:02.470 --> 00:03:02.480 
we haven't seen before and I think it's

00:03:02.480 --> 00:03:04.569 
we haven't seen before and I think it's
very<00:03:02.600> appropriate<00:03:03.170> to<00:03:03.470> the<00:03:04.070> times<00:03:04.310> that<00:03:04.489> we're

00:03:04.569 --> 00:03:04.579 
very appropriate to the times that we're

00:03:04.579 --> 00:03:05.740 
very appropriate to the times that we're
living<00:03:04.730> in<00:03:04.910> you<00:03:05.030> know<00:03:05.120> you<00:03:05.180> just<00:03:05.390> recently

living in you know you just recently
heard<00:03:05.870> that<00:03:05.989> story<00:03:06.200> about<00:03:06.410> Amy<00:03:06.650> Adams

00:03:07.090 --> 00:03:07.100 
heard that story about Amy Adams

00:03:07.100 --> 00:03:09.190 
heard that story about Amy Adams
famously<00:03:07.670> giving<00:03:08.239> up<00:03:08.329> her<00:03:08.510> first-class<00:03:08.930> seat

00:03:09.190 --> 00:03:09.200 
famously giving up her first-class seat

00:03:09.200 --> 00:03:11.710 
famously giving up her first-class seat
to<00:03:09.350> a<00:03:09.380> soldier<00:03:09.709> made<00:03:10.579> a<00:03:10.610> lot<00:03:10.820> of<00:03:10.850> news<00:03:11.480> online

00:03:11.710 --> 00:03:11.720 
to a soldier made a lot of news online

00:03:11.720 --> 00:03:14.140 
to a soldier made a lot of news online
trending<00:03:12.530> on<00:03:12.620> Twitter<00:03:12.890> etc<00:03:13.070> and<00:03:13.700> so<00:03:14.000> it's

00:03:14.140 --> 00:03:14.150 
trending on Twitter etc and so it's

00:03:14.150 --> 00:03:16.569 
trending on Twitter etc and so it's
funny<00:03:14.360> to<00:03:14.510> see<00:03:14.690> Vince<00:03:14.870> Vaughn<00:03:15.140> have<00:03:15.590> a<00:03:15.620> really

00:03:16.569 --> 00:03:16.579 
funny to see Vince Vaughn have a really

00:03:16.579 --> 00:03:18.880 
funny to see Vince Vaughn have a really
bad<00:03:16.790> scenario<00:03:17.510> there<00:03:17.840> and<00:03:18.079> as<00:03:18.410> I<00:03:18.560> said<00:03:18.620> the

00:03:18.880 --> 00:03:18.890 
bad scenario there and as I said the

00:03:18.890 --> 00:03:20.590 
bad scenario there and as I said the
joke<00:03:19.070> was<00:03:19.190> escalated<00:03:19.790> really<00:03:20.060> well<00:03:20.239> and<00:03:20.450> they

00:03:20.590 --> 00:03:20.600 
joke was escalated really well and they

00:03:20.600 --> 00:03:22.690 
joke was escalated really well and they
took<00:03:21.290> it<00:03:21.440> someplace<00:03:21.620> that<00:03:21.980> wasn't<00:03:22.489> expected

00:03:22.690 --> 00:03:22.700 
took it someplace that wasn't expected

00:03:22.700 --> 00:03:24.940 
took it someplace that wasn't expected
that<00:03:23.150> was<00:03:23.239> just<00:03:23.480> edgy<00:03:23.870> enough<00:03:23.959> to<00:03:24.620> make<00:03:24.799> it

00:03:24.940 --> 00:03:24.950 
that was just edgy enough to make it

00:03:24.950 --> 00:03:27.100 
that was just edgy enough to make it
really<00:03:25.519> funny<00:03:25.760> and<00:03:25.910> unique<00:03:26.239> and<00:03:26.480> I<00:03:26.840> think<00:03:26.870> the

00:03:27.100 --> 00:03:27.110 
really funny and unique and I think the

00:03:27.110 --> 00:03:28.750 
really funny and unique and I think the
whole<00:03:27.230> movie<00:03:27.620> is<00:03:27.680> kind<00:03:28.280> of<00:03:28.370> heading<00:03:28.640> in<00:03:28.730> that

00:03:28.750 --> 00:03:28.760 
whole movie is kind of heading in that

00:03:28.760 --> 00:03:30.490 
whole movie is kind of heading in that
direction<00:03:28.880> but<00:03:29.390> again<00:03:29.630> the<00:03:30.079> only<00:03:30.110> thing<00:03:30.320> that

00:03:30.490 --> 00:03:30.500 
direction but again the only thing that

00:03:30.500 --> 00:03:32.680 
direction but again the only thing that
seems<00:03:30.680> to<00:03:30.739> be<00:03:30.860> missing<00:03:31.220> is<00:03:31.400> humor<00:03:32.090> I<00:03:32.269> mean<00:03:32.600> I

00:03:32.680 --> 00:03:32.690 
seems to be missing is humor I mean I

00:03:32.690 --> 00:03:34.390 
seems to be missing is humor I mean I
really<00:03:33.049> like<00:03:33.260> so<00:03:33.500> many<00:03:33.590> of<00:03:33.769> the<00:03:33.829> ingredients

00:03:34.390 --> 00:03:34.400 
really like so many of the ingredients

00:03:34.400 --> 00:03:35.949 
really like so many of the ingredients
here<00:03:34.549> I'm<00:03:35.030> just<00:03:35.299> worried<00:03:35.570> about<00:03:35.600> how<00:03:35.810> they're

00:03:35.949 --> 00:03:35.959 
here I'm just worried about how they're

00:03:35.959 --> 00:03:37.720 
here I'm just worried about how they're
going<00:03:36.110> to<00:03:36.260> come<00:03:36.440> together<00:03:36.620> they<00:03:37.280> shouldn't<00:03:37.640> be

00:03:37.720 --> 00:03:37.730 
going to come together they shouldn't be

00:03:37.730 --> 00:03:39.610 
going to come together they shouldn't be
tasteless<00:03:38.150> because<00:03:38.600> again<00:03:38.870> it's<00:03:39.200> a<00:03:39.410> great

00:03:39.610 --> 00:03:39.620 
tasteless because again it's a great

00:03:39.620 --> 00:03:41.500 
tasteless because again it's a great
list<00:03:39.829> of<00:03:39.920> ingredients<00:03:40.100> the<00:03:40.850> premise<00:03:41.299> is

00:03:41.500 --> 00:03:41.510 
list of ingredients the premise is

00:03:41.510 --> 00:03:44.620 
list of ingredients the premise is
really<00:03:41.989> funny<00:03:42.230> I<00:03:42.470> love<00:03:42.980> the<00:03:43.130> idea<00:03:43.430> of<00:03:43.489> a<00:03:43.880> movie

00:03:44.620 --> 00:03:44.630 
really funny I love the idea of a movie

00:03:44.630 --> 00:03:46.000 
really funny I love the idea of a movie
about<00:03:44.720> a<00:03:44.840> business<00:03:45.260> trip<00:03:45.440> we<00:03:45.620> haven't<00:03:45.829> really

00:04:18.400 --> 00:04:18.410 
weird space to be in so I think I can

00:04:18.410 --> 00:04:19.930 
weird space to be in so I think I can
relate<00:04:18.500> to<00:04:18.709> that<00:04:18.739> aspect<00:04:19.250> of<00:04:19.400> this<00:04:19.519> movie<00:04:19.579> and

relate to that aspect of this movie and

00:04:19.940 --> 00:04:21.310 
relate to that aspect of this movie and
I<00:04:19.970> think<00:04:20.030> it's<00:04:20.299> a<00:04:20.359> lot<00:04:20.479> of<00:04:20.570> great<00:04:20.750> comedy<00:04:21.079> play

00:04:21.310 --> 00:04:21.320 
I think it's a lot of great comedy play

I think it's a lot of great comedy play
off<00:04:21.470> and<00:04:21.799> I<00:04:21.829> like<00:04:22.040> the<00:04:22.190> idea<00:04:22.220> there<00:04:22.940> meaning<00:04:23.210> up

00:04:23.530 --> 00:04:23.540 
off and I like the idea there meaning up

00:04:23.540 --> 00:04:26.230

can do it but one of the problems I had

00:05:25.460 --> 00:05:26.830 
can do it but one of the problems I had
with<00:05:25.520> her<00:05:25.639> character<00:05:25.880> though<00:05:26.270> is<00:05:26.450> that<00:05:26.479> I

00:05:26.830 --> 00:05:26.840 
with her character though is that I

00:05:26.840 --> 00:05:28.990 
with her character though is that I
didn't<00:05:27.800> think<00:05:27.949> it<00:05:28.010> was<00:05:28.099> funny<00:05:28.370> and<00:05:28.639> I<00:05:28.789> didn't

didn't think it was funny and I didn't

do during a business trip it's just too

00:05:37.970 --> 00:05:40.060 
do during a business trip it's just too
unprofessional<00:05:38.810> and<00:05:38.990> I<00:05:39.500> mean<00:05:39.680> I<00:05:39.830> don't<00:05:39.889> think

00:05:40.060 --> 00:05:40.070 
unprofessional and I mean I don't think

00:05:40.070 --> 00:05:41.439 
unprofessional and I mean I don't think
at<00:05:40.400> that<00:05:40.580> point<00:05:40.820> in<00:05:40.910> movie<00:05:41.120> she's<00:05:41.300> had<00:05:41.419> a

00:05:41.439 --> 00:05:41.449 
at that point in movie she's had a

00:05:41.449 --> 00:05:42.850 
at that point in movie she's had a
desperate<00:05:41.870> enough<00:05:42.020> point<00:05:42.320> to<00:05:42.440> stoop<00:05:42.680> to<00:05:42.830> that

00:05:42.850 --> 00:05:42.860 
desperate enough point to stoop to that

00:05:42.860 --> 00:05:45.070 
desperate enough point to stoop to that
level<00:05:43.010> and<00:05:43.490> I<00:05:43.910> think<00:05:44.150> it<00:05:44.240> just<00:05:44.270> it<00:05:44.630> makes<00:05:44.900> the

00:05:45.070 --> 00:05:45.080 
level and I think it just it makes the

00:05:45.080 --> 00:05:46.570 
level and I think it just it makes the
whole<00:05:45.229> thing<00:05:45.440> seem<00:05:45.650> unprofessional<00:05:45.919> and<00:05:46.490> I

00:05:46.570 --> 00:05:46.580 
whole thing seem unprofessional and I

00:05:46.580 --> 00:05:48.159 
whole thing seem unprofessional and I
think<00:05:46.760> that<00:05:46.880> might<00:05:47.060> be<00:05:47.210> my<00:05:47.360> biggest<00:05:47.570> complaint

00:05:48.159 --> 00:05:48.169 
think that might be my biggest complaint

00:05:48.169 --> 00:05:49.990 
think that might be my biggest complaint
so<00:05:48.349> far<00:05:48.530> about<00:05:48.740> this<00:05:48.919> and<00:05:49.340> it's<00:05:49.490> similar<00:05:49.699> to<00:05:49.970> a

00:05:49.990 --> 00:05:50.000 
so far about this and it's similar to a

00:05:50.000 --> 00:05:52.150 
so far about this and it's similar to a
problem<00:05:50.330> I<00:05:50.389> had<00:05:50.510> with<00:05:50.570> Horrible<00:05:50.960> Bosses<00:05:51.080> 2<00:05:51.349> and

00:05:52.150 --> 00:05:52.160 
problem I had with Horrible Bosses 2 and

00:05:52.160 --> 00:05:53.740 
problem I had with Horrible Bosses 2 and
that's<00:05:52.340> it<00:05:52.580> for<00:05:52.789> a<00:05:52.880> movie<00:05:53.000> about<00:05:53.210> business

00:05:53.740 --> 00:05:53.750 
that's it for a movie about business

00:05:53.750 --> 00:05:55.629 
that's it for a movie about business
there<00:05:54.139> isn't<00:05:54.500> actually<00:05:54.680> a<00:05:54.919> lot<00:05:55.070> of<00:05:55.160> discussion

00:05:55.629 --> 00:05:55.639 
there isn't actually a lot of discussion

00:05:55.639 --> 00:05:57.850 
there isn't actually a lot of discussion
about<00:05:55.729> business<00:05:56.330> and<00:05:57.020> I<00:05:57.110> can<00:05:57.410> understand

00:05:57.850 --> 00:05:57.860 
about business and I can understand

00:05:57.860 --> 00:06:00.129 
about business and I can understand
that's<00:05:58.130> hard<00:05:58.340> to<00:05:58.490> do<00:05:58.639> a<00:05:58.880> lot<00:05:59.479> of<00:05:59.510> times<00:05:59.750> people

00:06:00.129 --> 00:06:00.139 
that's hard to do a lot of times people

00:06:00.139 --> 00:06:02.620 
that's hard to do a lot of times people
who<00:06:00.229> go<00:06:00.380> into<00:06:00.680> the<00:06:01.430> arts<00:06:01.729> don't<00:06:02.210> have<00:06:02.330> a<00:06:02.360> strong

00:06:02.620 --> 00:06:02.630 
who go into the arts don't have a strong

00:06:02.630 --> 00:06:04.409 
who go into the arts don't have a strong
you<00:06:03.020> know<00:06:03.139> understanding<00:06:03.830> of<00:06:03.949> business

particularly<00:06:05.419> on<00:06:05.630> the<00:06:05.720> creative<00:06:06.169> side<00:06:06.349> I<00:06:06.680> mean

00:06:07.209 --> 00:06:07.219 
particularly on the creative side I mean

00:06:07.219 --> 00:06:09.040 
particularly on the creative side I mean
you're<00:06:07.400> it's<00:06:07.820> ideal<00:06:08.300> for<00:06:08.599> you<00:06:08.659> to<00:06:08.750> have<00:06:08.870> both

you're it's ideal for you to have both

00:06:09.050 --> 00:06:10.390 
you're it's ideal for you to have both
because<00:06:09.349> that<00:06:09.469> you<00:06:09.560> can<00:06:09.710> handle<00:06:10.219> your<00:06:10.310> own

00:06:10.930 --> 00:06:10.940 
career

00:06:10.940 --> 00:06:12.880 
career
best<00:06:11.120> but<00:06:11.750> I<00:06:11.780> think<00:06:11.870> its<00:06:12.140> course<00:06:12.410> easier<00:06:12.740> to

00:06:12.880 --> 00:06:12.890 
best but I think its course easier to

00:06:12.890 --> 00:06:14.350 
best but I think its course easier to
write<00:06:13.040> a<00:06:13.220> movie<00:06:13.490> that<00:06:13.700> focuses<00:06:14.150> on<00:06:14.240> the

point in the movie was Kevin Spacey's

00:06:23.840 --> 00:06:25.780 
point in the movie was Kevin Spacey's
cameo<00:06:24.290> because<00:06:24.680> he<00:06:24.980> addressed<00:06:25.340> actual

that's what made it funny and so I think
that<00:06:33.080> I<00:06:33.110> wish<00:06:33.290> the<00:06:33.410> movie<00:06:33.500> had<00:06:33.740> more<00:06:33.920> business
