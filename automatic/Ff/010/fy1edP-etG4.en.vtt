00:00:08.139 --> 00:00:15.320
 900 is a bike with a very aesthetic 

00:00:11.780 --> 00:00:18.260
 special since it combines aesthetics 

00:00:15.320 --> 00:00:21.580
 froude of a save with technology 

00:00:18.260 --> 00:00:25.610
 from bmw the title chassis to 'the truth' 

00:00:21.580 --> 00:00:28.250
 the 900 motor that basically is the 

00:00:25.610 --> 00:00:33.640
 bmw engine enhancement in fact 

00:00:28.250 --> 00:00:33.640
 800 here we see others 

00:00:34.630 --> 00:00:39.520
 what does this monoshock have one thing 

00:00:37.990 --> 00:00:42.550
 very particular is that on this side 

00:00:39.520 --> 00:00:44.560
 right of the bike is the chain by 

00:00:42.550 --> 00:00:46.140
 here behind the motorbike is very very very 

00:00:44.560 --> 00:00:49.350
 narrow 

00:00:46.140 --> 00:00:52.800
 it becomes somewhat uncomfortable for the passenger and 

00:00:49.350 --> 00:00:57.030
 the exhaust comes from the left side 

00:00:52.800 --> 00:00:59.920
 here we have the deposit that comes 

00:00:57.030 --> 00:01:04.120
 practically at the height of 

00:00:59.920 --> 00:01:06.160
 conventional but good this what 

00:01:04.120 --> 00:01:07.330
 is that it houses the deposit that is 

00:01:06.160 --> 00:01:10.800
 find under the seat for 

00:01:07.330 --> 00:01:10.800
 center center 

00:01:11.950 --> 00:01:17.399
 with the three crimes that go by the 

00:01:15.070 --> 00:01:17.399
 front of 

00:01:19.210 --> 00:01:26.590
 we have a very peculiar mask that 

00:01:24.340 --> 00:01:28.150
 It looks a lot like the off-road bikes of the 

00:01:26.590 --> 00:01:30.550
 brand 

00:01:28.150 --> 00:01:33.960
 and the aerodynamic protection that we 

00:01:30.550 --> 00:01:38.490
 offers is practically nil doing it 

00:01:33.960 --> 00:01:38.490
 quite uncomfortable at high speeds 

00:01:38.630 --> 00:01:46.450
 the forks are signed by sachs 

00:01:41.950 --> 00:01:50.149
 for equipment the brembo brakes with 

00:01:46.450 --> 00:01:52.460
 radial anchor and same as the clamp and 

00:01:50.149 --> 00:01:57.079
 Then, well, these fins that are 

00:01:52.460 --> 00:01:59.799
 mini picudas highlighting that aesthetic a 

00:01:57.079 --> 00:01:59.799
 so special 

00:01:59.830 --> 00:02:06.280
 good a little more 

00:02:03.020 --> 00:02:06.280
 let's move on to try it 

00:02:13.349 --> 00:02:16.890
 the prayer 

00:02:51.790 --> 00:02:54.689
 at all times 

00:03:10.500 --> 00:03:13.500
 do not 

00:03:23.310 --> 00:03:26.780
 I hope you liked it until the 

00:03:24.630 --> 00:03:26.780
 following
