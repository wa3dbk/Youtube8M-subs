00:01:44.420 --> 00:01:44.430 
this thing is really small we're going

00:01:44.430 --> 00:01:45.649 
this thing is really small we're going
to<00:01:44.520> compare<00:01:44.640> it<00:01:44.850> to<00:01:44.939> a<00:01:45.000> couple<00:01:45.210> of<00:01:45.240> objects

00:01:45.649 --> 00:01:45.659 
to compare it to a couple of objects

00:01:45.659 --> 00:01:49.340 
to compare it to a couple of objects
here<00:01:46.500> is<00:01:46.619> a<00:01:46.649> standard<00:01:47.159> double<00:01:47.399> a<00:01:47.490> battery<00:01:48.350> as

00:01:49.340 --> 00:01:49.350 
here is a standard double a battery as

00:01:49.350 --> 00:01:52.730 
here is a standard double a battery as
you<00:01:49.500> can<00:01:49.560> tell<00:01:50.840> pretty<00:01:51.840> small<00:01:52.200> compared<00:01:52.500> to<00:01:52.530> it

00:01:52.730 --> 00:01:52.740 
you can tell pretty small compared to it

00:01:52.740 --> 00:01:58.190 
you can tell pretty small compared to it
here's<00:01:53.460> a<00:01:53.520> triple<00:01:54.180> a<00:01:54.299> battery<00:01:55.430> so<00:01:57.079> just<00:01:58.079> get

00:01:58.190 --> 00:01:58.200 
here's a triple a battery so just get

00:01:58.200 --> 00:02:01.249 
here's a triple a battery so just get
you<00:01:58.409> comparison<00:01:58.950> here<00:01:59.250> is<00:01:59.460> a<00:01:59.790> coke<00:02:00.659> bottle<00:02:00.960> cap

00:02:01.249 --> 00:02:01.259 
you comparison here is a coke bottle cap

00:02:01.259 --> 00:02:02.630 
you comparison here is a coke bottle cap
so<00:02:01.380> it's<00:02:01.469> about<00:02:01.619> the<00:02:01.740> same<00:02:01.860> size<00:02:01.920> as<00:02:02.369> a<00:02:02.399> coke

00:02:02.630 --> 00:02:02.640 
so it's about the same size as a coke

00:02:02.640 --> 00:02:04.450 
so it's about the same size as a coke
bottle<00:02:03.180> cap<00:02:03.509> if<00:02:03.689> you<00:02:03.810> were<00:02:03.899> to<00:02:04.020> compare

00:02:04.450 --> 00:02:04.460 
bottle cap if you were to compare

00:02:04.460 --> 00:02:06.679 
bottle cap if you were to compare
instructions<00:02:05.460> say<00:02:05.640> to<00:02:05.670> charge<00:02:06.119> the<00:02:06.360> speaker

00:02:06.679 --> 00:02:06.689 
instructions say to charge the speaker

00:02:06.689 --> 00:02:07.999 
instructions say to charge the speaker
for<00:02:06.960> about<00:02:07.229> an<00:02:07.350> hour<00:02:07.439> so<00:02:07.680> I'm<00:02:07.740> just<00:02:07.829> going<00:02:07.950> to
