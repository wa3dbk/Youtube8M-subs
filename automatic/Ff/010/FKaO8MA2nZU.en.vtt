00:01:38.780 --> 00:01:38.790 
your 15 minute limit don't do that make

00:01:38.790 --> 00:01:42.679 
your 15 minute limit don't do that make
yourself<00:01:39.270> stop<00:01:39.600> use<00:01:40.850> practice<00:01:41.850> pad<00:01:42.150> patterns

00:01:42.679 --> 00:01:42.689 
yourself stop use practice pad patterns

00:01:42.689 --> 00:01:47.179 
yourself stop use practice pad patterns
like<00:01:43.079> this<00:01:43.350> one<00:01:43.590> down<00:01:44.369> and<00:01:44.790> down<00:01:45.329> down<00:01:46.259> down

00:01:47.179 --> 00:01:47.189 
like this one down and down down down

00:01:47.189 --> 00:01:52.460 
like this one down and down down down
and<00:01:48.049> down<00:01:49.049> and<00:01:49.110> down<00:01:49.619> and<00:01:49.950> down<00:01:50.430> and<00:01:51.180> down<00:01:51.470> then

00:01:52.460 --> 00:01:52.470 
and down and down and down and down then

00:01:52.470 --> 00:02:06.690 
and down and down and down and down then
write<00:01:52.799> a<00:01:52.829> couple<00:01:53.430> of<00:01:54.770> words<00:01:55.770> like<00:01:56.630> up<00:01:59.810> my<00:02:03.049> you

00:02:06.690 --> 00:02:06.700 

00:02:06.700 --> 00:02:10.420 

then<00:02:07.700> write<00:02:08.259> some<00:02:09.259> more<00:02:09.500> little<00:02:10.009> patterns

00:02:10.420 --> 00:02:10.430 
then write some more little patterns

00:02:10.430 --> 00:02:15.150 
then write some more little patterns
like<00:02:10.729> that<00:02:12.220> now<00:02:13.220> I<00:02:13.250> wonder<00:02:13.760> if<00:02:13.940> you<00:02:14.090> can<00:02:14.240> see

00:02:15.150 --> 00:02:15.160 
like that now I wonder if you can see

00:02:15.160 --> 00:02:19.840 
like that now I wonder if you can see
that<00:02:16.480> these<00:02:17.480> patterns<00:02:17.990> have<00:02:18.320> controlled<00:02:18.950> the

00:02:19.840 --> 00:02:19.850 
that these patterns have controlled the

00:02:19.850 --> 00:02:22.180 
that these patterns have controlled the
spacing<00:02:20.480> between<00:02:20.690> the<00:02:20.990> letter<00:02:21.380> between<00:02:21.860> the

spacing between the letter between the

00:02:22.190 --> 00:02:28.050 
spacing between the letter between the

00:02:28.050 --> 00:02:28.060 
words the spacing that is between each

00:02:28.060 --> 00:02:33.460 
words the spacing that is between each
downstroke<00:02:29.350> here<00:02:30.350> and<00:02:31.150> it<00:02:32.150> has<00:02:32.600> controlled

00:02:33.460 --> 00:02:33.470 
downstroke here and it has controlled

00:02:33.470 --> 00:02:38.610 
downstroke here and it has controlled
the<00:02:34.070> slant<00:02:34.550> if<00:02:34.910> I<00:02:35.750> wrote<00:02:36.020> a<00:02:36.790> bunch<00:02:37.790> of<00:02:37.970> elves

00:02:38.610 --> 00:02:38.620 
the slant if I wrote a bunch of elves

00:02:38.620 --> 00:02:41.410 
the slant if I wrote a bunch of elves
the<00:02:39.620> elves<00:02:39.680> would<00:02:40.100> all<00:02:40.280> be<00:02:40.550> a<00:02:40.850> consistent

00:02:41.410 --> 00:02:41.420 
the elves would all be a consistent

00:02:41.420 --> 00:02:46.180 
the elves would all be a consistent
slant<00:02:41.990> because<00:02:42.950> I<00:02:43.550> am<00:02:43.880> pulling<00:02:44.450> those<00:02:45.190> down

00:02:46.180 --> 00:02:46.190 
slant because I am pulling those down

slant because I am pulling those down
strokes<00:02:46.670> toward<00:02:47.180> my<00:02:47.390> midline<00:02:47.810> so<00:02:48.590> this<00:02:49.100> will

00:02:49.300 --> 00:02:49.310 
strokes toward my midline so this will

00:02:49.310 --> 00:02:51.490 
strokes toward my midline so this will
this<00:02:49.730> little<00:02:50.090> simple<00:02:50.450> pattern<00:02:50.959> which<00:02:51.200> you<00:02:51.350> can

00:02:51.490 --> 00:02:51.500 
this little simple pattern which you can

00:02:51.500 --> 00:02:53.350 
this little simple pattern which you can
do<00:02:51.680> with<00:02:51.709> your<00:02:51.980> eyes<00:02:52.010> closed<00:02:52.520> and<00:02:52.730> I<00:02:52.850> suggest

00:02:53.350 --> 00:02:53.360 
do with your eyes closed and I suggest

00:02:53.360 --> 00:02:56.050 
do with your eyes closed and I suggest
you<00:02:53.480> do<00:02:53.630> it<00:02:53.720> with<00:02:53.840> your<00:02:53.990> eyes<00:02:54.110> closed<00:02:55.060> will

00:02:56.050 --> 00:02:56.060 
you do it with your eyes closed will

00:02:56.060 --> 00:02:58.620 
you do it with your eyes closed will
control<00:02:56.540> your<00:02:57.260> the<00:02:57.650> size<00:02:57.920> of<00:02:58.100> your<00:02:58.220> letters

00:02:58.620 --> 00:02:58.630 
control your the size of your letters

00:02:58.630 --> 00:03:03.190 
control your the size of your letters
the<00:02:59.630> spacing<00:03:00.200> the<00:03:00.440> slant<00:03:01.400> and<00:03:01.870> it<00:03:02.870> will<00:03:02.989> keep

00:03:03.190 --> 00:03:03.200 
the spacing the slant and it will keep

00:03:03.200 --> 00:03:05.320 
the spacing the slant and it will keep
all<00:03:03.440> of<00:03:03.530> your<00:03:03.980> writing<00:03:04.220> consistent<00:03:05.090> and

00:03:05.320 --> 00:03:05.330 
all of your writing consistent and

00:03:05.330 --> 00:03:08.530 
all of your writing consistent and
consistency<00:03:06.260> is<00:03:06.680> key<00:03:06.950> to<00:03:07.130> legibility<00:03:07.760> this

00:03:08.530 --> 00:03:08.540 
consistency is key to legibility this

00:03:08.540 --> 00:03:11.650 
consistency is key to legibility this
pattern<00:03:08.959> is<00:03:09.170> a<00:03:09.820> counter<00:03:10.820> clockwise<00:03:11.090> pattern

00:03:11.650 --> 00:03:11.660 
pattern is a counter clockwise pattern

00:03:11.660 --> 00:03:18.670 
pattern is a counter clockwise pattern
you<00:03:12.500> see<00:03:12.739> it<00:03:12.860> moves<00:03:13.160> around<00:03:17.019> opposite<00:03:18.019> to<00:03:18.350> a

00:03:18.670 --> 00:03:18.680 
you see it moves around opposite to a

00:03:18.680 --> 00:03:22.750 
you see it moves around opposite to a
clockwise<00:03:19.519> direction<00:03:19.580> so<00:03:20.680> does<00:03:21.680> this<00:03:21.950> this

00:03:22.750 --> 00:03:22.760 
clockwise direction so does this this

00:03:22.760 --> 00:03:27.699 
clockwise direction so does this this
you<00:03:23.090> goes<00:03:23.920> opposite<00:03:24.920> to<00:03:25.549> clockwise<00:03:26.350> so<00:03:27.350> to<00:03:27.410> all

00:03:27.699 --> 00:03:27.709 
you goes opposite to clockwise so to all

00:03:27.709 --> 00:03:30.039 
you goes opposite to clockwise so to all

of these letters they move around like

00:03:30.049 --> 00:03:34.060 
of these letters they move around like
that<00:03:30.260> they<00:03:30.530> move<00:03:30.709> around<00:03:30.860> like<00:03:31.340> that<00:03:33.070> practice

00:03:34.060 --> 00:03:34.070 
that they move around like that practice

00:03:34.070 --> 00:03:37.090 
that they move around like that practice
these<00:03:34.330> few<00:03:35.330> of<00:03:35.450> these<00:03:35.540> patterns<00:03:35.950> practice<00:03:36.950> a

these few of these patterns practice a

00:03:40.780 --> 00:03:40.790 
few letters practice a few words then

00:03:40.790 --> 00:03:43.570 
few letters practice a few words then
try<00:03:41.209> the<00:03:41.269> clockwise<00:03:41.930> pattern<00:03:42.320> which<00:03:43.040> is<00:03:43.250> down
