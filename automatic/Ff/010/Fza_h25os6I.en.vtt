00:01:34.370 --> 00:01:34.380 
really good idea but then it was kind of

00:01:34.380 --> 00:01:36.380 
really good idea but then it was kind of
messy<00:01:34.710> because<00:01:34.979> I<00:01:35.009> did<00:01:35.280> try<00:01:35.460> it<00:01:35.490> out<00:01:35.640> myself<00:01:35.850> I

00:01:36.380 --> 00:01:36.390 
messy because I did try it out myself I

00:01:36.390 --> 00:01:38.600 
messy because I did try it out myself I
don't<00:01:36.540> remember<00:01:36.750> why<00:01:37.080> but<00:01:37.500> I<00:01:37.770> tried<00:01:38.340> it<00:01:38.369> out

your hands are touching the chalk and it

00:02:04.530 --> 00:02:06.350 
your hands are touching the chalk and it
just<00:02:04.799> gets<00:02:05.310> rid<00:02:05.460> of<00:02:05.520> a<00:02:05.610> lot<00:02:05.640> of<00:02:05.759> the<00:02:05.880> mess<00:02:06.030> so

00:02:06.350 --> 00:02:06.360 
just gets rid of a lot of the mess so

00:02:06.360 --> 00:02:08.090 
just gets rid of a lot of the mess so

00:03:20.440 --> 00:03:20.450 
rugs out of the bathroom so I thought

00:03:20.450 --> 00:03:21.760 
rugs out of the bathroom so I thought
this<00:03:20.600> would<00:03:20.750> be<00:03:20.900> a<00:03:20.930> good<00:03:21.140> time<00:03:21.290> to<00:03:21.410> try<00:03:21.530> them

00:03:21.760 --> 00:03:21.770

ahead<00:03:36.560> and<00:03:36.890> show<00:03:37.190> you<00:03:37.420> how<00:03:38.420> it<00:03:38.660> works<00:03:38.870> it's

00:03:39.160 --> 00:03:39.170 
ahead and show you how it works it's

00:03:39.170 --> 00:03:41.980 
ahead and show you how it works it's
actually<00:03:39.380> pretty<00:03:39.890> simple<00:03:40.550> you<00:03:41.180> just<00:03:41.210> open<00:03:41.900> it

00:03:41.980 --> 00:03:41.990 
actually pretty simple you just open it

00:03:41.990 --> 00:03:44.530 
actually pretty simple you just open it
up<00:03:42.290> and<00:03:42.560> in<00:03:43.220> some<00:03:43.250> cases<00:03:43.730> it's<00:03:44.000> already<00:03:44.240> open

00:03:44.530 --> 00:03:44.540 
up and in some cases it's already open

00:03:44.540 --> 00:03:46.810 
up and in some cases it's already open
like<00:03:44.720> my<00:03:44.900> pink<00:03:45.200> one<00:03:45.440> so<00:03:45.650> I'm<00:03:46.160> pretty<00:03:46.430> sure<00:03:46.580> this

00:03:46.810 --> 00:03:46.820 
like my pink one so I'm pretty sure this

00:03:46.820 --> 00:03:48.760 
like my pink one so I'm pretty sure this
sponge<00:03:47.180> is<00:03:47.420> the<00:03:47.630> one<00:03:47.810> that's<00:03:48.080> on<00:03:48.410> the<00:03:48.530> bottom

00:03:48.760 --> 00:03:48.770 
sponge is the one that's on the bottom

00:03:48.770 --> 00:03:50.650 
sponge is the one that's on the bottom
because<00:03:49.280> in<00:03:49.430> the<00:03:49.520> picture<00:03:49.880> it's<00:03:50.060> that<00:03:50.270> way<00:03:50.420> and

00:03:50.650 --> 00:03:50.660 
because in the picture it's that way and

00:03:50.660 --> 00:03:53.320 
because in the picture it's that way and
then<00:03:51.170> you<00:03:51.260> just<00:03:51.470> take<00:03:51.650> your<00:03:51.710> hair<00:03:52.160> so<00:03:53.060> just

00:03:53.320 --> 00:03:53.330 
then you just take your hair so just

00:03:53.330 --> 00:03:58.960 
then you just take your hair so just
like<00:03:53.480> a<00:03:53.510> strand<00:03:53.960> of<00:03:54.260> it<00:03:55.030> and<00:03:56.800> kind<00:03:57.800> of<00:03:57.920> just<00:03:58.850> put

00:03:58.960 --> 00:03:58.970 
like a strand of it and kind of just put

00:03:58.970 --> 00:04:02.230 
like a strand of it and kind of just put
it<00:03:59.210> right<00:03:59.330> in<00:03:59.540> there<00:03:59.750> and<00:04:00.610> then<00:04:01.610> I<00:04:01.760> guess<00:04:01.970> you

00:04:02.230 --> 00:04:02.240 
it right in there and then I guess you

00:04:02.240 --> 00:04:10.210 
it right in there and then I guess you
just<00:04:02.270> slide<00:04:02.780> it<00:04:02.990> right<00:04:03.020> down

00:04:10.210 --> 00:04:10.220

I did where I combined a couple um and I
don't<00:06:49.320> know<00:06:49.380> about<00:06:49.470> you<00:06:49.620> guys<00:06:49.770> but<00:06:50.070> I<00:06:50.130> think

this<00:06:50.700> looks<00:06:51.030> good<00:06:51.300> on<00:06:51.360> me<00:06:51.660> oh<00:06:52.640> this<00:06:53.640> might<00:06:53.970> be<00:06:54.120> a

00:06:54.140 --> 00:06:54.150 
this looks good on me oh this might be a

00:06:54.150 --> 00:06:55.010 
this looks good on me oh this might be a
problem

00:06:55.010 --> 00:06:55.020

00:06:55.020 --> 00:06:56.630 
problem
I<00:06:55.050> really<00:06:55.830> think<00:06:56.010> studying<00:06:56.460> it<00:06:56.550> with

00:06:56.630 --> 00:06:56.640 
I really think studying it with

00:06:56.640 --> 00:06:58.760 
I really think studying it with
hairspray<00:06:56.970> would<00:06:57.240> work<00:06:57.450> let<00:06:57.930> me<00:06:57.960> go<00:06:58.140> try<00:06:58.200> it<00:06:58.470> on

00:06:58.760 --> 00:06:58.770 
hairspray would work let me go try it on

00:06:58.770 --> 00:07:02.180 
hairspray would work let me go try it on
a<00:06:58.800> couple<00:06:59.190> of<00:06:59.280> them<00:07:00.620> seems<00:07:01.620> like<00:07:01.800> it<00:07:02.010> is

00:07:02.180 --> 00:07:02.190 
a couple of them seems like it is

00:07:02.190 --> 00:07:04.010 
a couple of them seems like it is
working<00:07:02.700> I'm<00:07:02.880> going<00:07:03.030> to<00:07:03.120> do<00:07:03.270> more<00:07:03.540> so<00:07:03.750> I<00:07:03.840> can

00:07:21.920 --> 00:07:21.930 
whoopsie but it did seem to help maybe

00:07:21.930 --> 00:07:24.890 
whoopsie but it did seem to help maybe
because<00:07:22.320> a<00:07:22.350> lot<00:07:22.560> of<00:07:22.590> it<00:07:22.800> went<00:07:22.950> away<00:07:23.040> but<00:07:23.550> um<00:07:24.030> I

00:07:24.890 --> 00:07:24.900 
because a lot of it went away but um I

00:07:24.900 --> 00:07:26.450 
because a lot of it went away but um I
think<00:07:25.200> I<00:07:25.410> should<00:07:25.590> have<00:07:25.710> sprayed<00:07:26.040> it<00:07:26.160> farther

00:07:26.450 --> 00:07:26.460 
think I should have sprayed it farther

00:07:26.460 --> 00:07:29.480 
think I should have sprayed it farther
and<00:07:26.880> not<00:07:27.030> as<00:07:27.210> much<00:07:27.480> but<00:07:28.260> I<00:07:28.620> really<00:07:29.130> do<00:07:29.280> think

00:07:29.480 --> 00:07:29.490 
and not as much but I really do think

00:07:29.490 --> 00:07:31.610 
and not as much but I really do think
that<00:07:29.550> helps<00:07:29.970> it<00:07:30.150> stay<00:07:30.480> oops

00:07:31.610 --> 00:07:31.620 
that helps it stay oops

00:07:31.620 --> 00:07:34.190 
that helps it stay oops
so<00:07:31.980> that's<00:07:32.400> it<00:07:32.610> for<00:07:32.880> my<00:07:33.030> review<00:07:33.060> on<00:07:33.510> hot<00:07:33.750> hues

00:07:34.190 --> 00:07:34.200
