00:00:05.250 --> 00:00:08.960
 so here we have a steamer 

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:16.550
 here I would have the cake I have a 

00:00:14.990 --> 00:00:19.760
 round mold almost all my ills are 

00:00:16.550 --> 00:00:22.189
 square and it would have to be one that 

00:00:19.760 --> 00:00:23.960
 between here more or less like that to put it 

00:00:22.189 --> 00:00:25.350
 cover it with an aluminum and put in the 

00:00:23.960 --> 00:00:27.970
 steamer 

00:00:25.350 --> 00:00:30.289
 but I found this 

00:00:27.970 --> 00:00:34.329
 golden 

00:00:30.289 --> 00:00:34.329
 and it fits perfectly there 

00:00:34.860 --> 00:00:42.710
 so just like we're going to put it 

00:00:38.460 --> 00:00:45.290
 and the lid fits perfectly there 

00:00:42.710 --> 00:00:47.629
 so he's going to cover it very well because 

00:00:45.290 --> 00:00:51.550
 if you realize the joke that you have to 

00:00:47.629 --> 00:00:51.550
 get away absolutely nothing 

00:00:51.800 --> 00:00:55.460
 well then let's start doing 

00:00:54.079 --> 00:00:58.070
 the steamed cake 

00:00:55.460 --> 00:01:02.030
 here is a pot with hot water that 

00:00:58.070 --> 00:01:04.519
 is about to boil yet 

00:01:02.030 --> 00:01:09.370
 the steamer base would honestly have 

00:01:04.519 --> 00:01:12.270
 to go in here inside the cake and the lid 

00:01:09.370 --> 00:01:13.950
 It will give you plenty of space 

00:01:12.270 --> 00:01:16.350
 so that the cakes inside 

00:01:13.950 --> 00:01:20.340
 they can even be another floor in the other 

00:01:16.350 --> 00:01:23.729
 floor another cake if you want and cover it and 

00:01:20.340 --> 00:01:25.640
 then join them and make a cake 

00:01:23.729 --> 00:01:32.030
 two customers 

00:01:25.640 --> 00:01:36.500
 good pieces but in my case 

00:01:32.030 --> 00:01:40.110
 I do not have more than this but I realized 

00:01:36.500 --> 00:01:43.050
 that this one here 

00:01:40.110 --> 00:01:45.060
 it covers perfectly you get here because 

00:01:43.050 --> 00:01:47.430
 the joke is that here it does not come out the 

00:01:45.060 --> 00:01:50.940
 steam we have to make it fit 

00:01:47.430 --> 00:01:53.550
 perfect and obviously that steam that 

00:01:50.940 --> 00:01:55.890
 stuck then we're going 

00:01:53.550 --> 00:01:58.470
 to ride all this on our life 

00:01:55.890 --> 00:02:02.160
 with hot water when already at a time 

00:01:58.470 --> 00:02:07.370
 to pour the cake mix now 

00:02:02.160 --> 00:02:07.370
 the cake mix that is this 

00:02:08.170 --> 00:02:14.860
 everyone knows or any cake 

00:02:12.130 --> 00:02:16.180
 of box if you want to make brownie something 

00:02:14.860 --> 00:02:18.459
 obviously you have to have a mold 

00:02:16.180 --> 00:02:20.380
 square but now it's here we're going to 

00:02:18.459 --> 00:02:22.569
 see how it will be and I'll teach you 

00:02:20.380 --> 00:02:25.480
 the result without him good there is the 

00:02:22.569 --> 00:02:27.100
 experiment and well let's tell him the 

00:02:25.480 --> 00:02:30.160
 now I'm going to put you here 

00:02:27.100 --> 00:02:33.700
 how much time is there in how much time 

00:02:30.160 --> 00:02:35.470
 has been cooked there is another way to 

00:02:33.700 --> 00:02:38.920
 to do it that my friend did it was 

00:02:35.470 --> 00:02:41.410
 that put a comal or a can or something 

00:02:38.920 --> 00:02:43.900
 under as thick as possible and 

00:02:41.410 --> 00:02:46.390
 on top I put the mold to the fire more more 

00:02:43.900 --> 00:02:48.190
 shorter than there was and covered it with 

00:02:46.390 --> 00:02:51.850
 eliminated and put a weight on it so that 

00:02:48.190 --> 00:02:53.799
 it will heat up and the cake was like 45 

00:02:51.850 --> 00:02:55.780
 minutes and they came out some very very 

00:02:53.799 --> 00:02:58.390
 the rich sponge cake biscuits 

00:02:55.780 --> 00:03:01.120
 oratories would be very rich to them 

00:02:58.390 --> 00:03:02.980
 and orange cake but good we're going to 

00:03:01.120 --> 00:03:05.020
 talk to put this steamer the 

00:03:02.980 --> 00:03:06.550
 we buy and we will buy the Chinese and 

00:03:05.020 --> 00:03:08.850
 he gave it to me to experience is the 

00:03:06.550 --> 00:03:12.210
 first time that the experimental 

00:03:08.850 --> 00:03:14.220
 and here I was valued the oven and but 

00:03:12.210 --> 00:03:16.050
 you can use the normal metal steamer 

00:03:14.220 --> 00:03:19.260
 there is a steamer that also adapts 

00:03:16.050 --> 00:03:21.510
 here and always almost come as a gift 

00:03:19.260 --> 00:03:23.760
 with the action is under pressure and they are 

00:03:21.510 --> 00:03:25.560
 extensions and there you can enter so that 

00:03:23.760 --> 00:03:27.180
 very good the cake and only the tapas 

00:03:25.560 --> 00:03:30.060
 by aluminum 

00:03:27.180 --> 00:03:33.680
 are one and three so let's see in 

00:03:30.060 --> 00:03:33.680
 how much time is ready 

00:03:33.710 --> 00:03:40.630
 1 and 55 we are going to turn off the steamer and 

00:03:37.280 --> 00:03:40.630
 see how the cake is 

00:03:41.030 --> 00:03:46.660
 well just stop this steamer and it's 

00:03:43.280 --> 00:03:46.660
 just like the cake 

00:03:46.990 --> 00:03:54.550
 it comes off very fast from the sides 

00:03:49.970 --> 00:03:58.290
 and if you put the knife to see 

00:03:54.550 --> 00:04:01.439
 and good comes out clean 

00:03:58.290 --> 00:04:02.879
 then I'll wait for it to cool yes 

00:04:01.439 --> 00:04:04.170
 when molds mold or with 

00:04:02.879 --> 00:04:07.620
 careful because I just hit a 

00:04:04.170 --> 00:04:09.359
 cream that almost called 911 then 

00:04:07.620 --> 00:04:12.580
 let's let it cool later what 

00:04:09.359 --> 00:04:15.330
 we unmold and see how it looks 

00:04:12.580 --> 00:04:18.519
 well then what happened here is that 

00:04:15.330 --> 00:04:21.519
 I'm going to show you what the 

00:04:18.519 --> 00:04:23.230
 edge today grasp with the little finger you see 

00:04:21.519 --> 00:04:24.820
 how a little but it's like I had 

00:04:23.230 --> 00:04:26.830
 the water and like the water has not stopped 

00:04:24.820 --> 00:04:27.970
 that sticks to the edges that's good 

00:04:26.830 --> 00:04:32.830
 I think 

00:04:27.970 --> 00:04:35.230
 and well what the slab that we have done 

00:04:32.830 --> 00:04:38.530
 turn off and after 20 minutes just take it out 

00:04:35.230 --> 00:04:41.010
 and waiting 20 minutes was much more 

00:04:38.530 --> 00:04:43.660
 sign then my advice is that what 

00:04:41.010 --> 00:04:45.610
 turn off and leave it capped for 20 minutes and 

00:04:43.660 --> 00:04:47.050
 school uncover so that the 

00:04:45.610 --> 00:04:49.700
 steam a little do not make the hand 

00:04:47.050 --> 00:04:52.400
 because as I say they are going to burn 

00:04:49.700 --> 00:04:54.370
 and now it's going to cool a little bit for 

00:04:52.400 --> 00:04:57.780
 dismantle it 

00:04:54.370 --> 00:04:57.780
 let's see from here 

00:04:57.840 --> 00:05:05.120
 and it took off very well 

00:05:00.870 --> 00:05:05.120
 and so it was 

00:05:05.920 --> 00:05:10.050
 good and here is the final result 

00:05:07.900 --> 00:05:13.240
 here as you will see there is a small hole 

00:05:10.050 --> 00:05:16.390
 no it was not the baking's fault it was my 

00:05:13.240 --> 00:05:19.660
 blame and look at the truth that is good 

00:05:16.390 --> 00:05:22.690
 texture to the edge that was like aguadito 

00:05:19.660 --> 00:05:24.370
 Look, it looked good, it 's ready as if 

00:05:22.690 --> 00:05:26.800
 they want to frustrate you, you want to throw 

00:05:24.370 --> 00:05:29.520
 something over you can put 

00:05:26.800 --> 00:05:35.440
 but where is basically very good 

00:05:29.520 --> 00:05:37.270
 I like to put it like that, I did it because 

00:05:35.440 --> 00:05:39.819
 it reminds me that Koreans is a lot 

00:05:37.270 --> 00:05:43.990
 as well as steam things and good is it 

00:05:39.819 --> 00:05:46.720
 it happened and it went well now benefits 

00:05:43.990 --> 00:05:49.319
 well the demold dow was super fast 

00:05:46.720 --> 00:05:54.460
 that's right after I took it out and put it here 

00:05:49.319 --> 00:05:56.379
 with the mold and everything I put in the fridge 

00:05:54.460 --> 00:05:58.509
 like for 20 minutes to unmold 

00:05:56.379 --> 00:06:00.879
 easier and it grabbed a lot of texture and it 

00:05:58.509 --> 00:06:03.669
 it got a lot tougher but it's still 

00:06:00.879 --> 00:06:05.770
 soft and the good thing was that the mold was 

00:06:03.669 --> 00:06:10.289
 washed super super fast with a little 

00:06:05.770 --> 00:06:12.639
 of water are usually good I am 

00:06:10.289 --> 00:06:14.289
 pyromaniac says my mom because I burned 

00:06:12.639 --> 00:06:16.240
 all the molds burned all today 

00:06:14.289 --> 00:06:18.430
 is in a facility to burn things 

00:06:16.240 --> 00:06:20.590
 there's even one thing that they sell that says 

00:06:18.430 --> 00:06:22.659
 which is a pan that is impossible to 

00:06:20.590 --> 00:06:24.819
 I burned my mom says she's going to 

00:06:22.659 --> 00:06:26.319
 buy and I was going to test if it's true if 

00:06:24.819 --> 00:06:28.520
 I do not want it a week then 

00:06:26.319 --> 00:06:31.039
 it really works very well 

00:06:28.520 --> 00:06:33.410
 like everything but in this case like no 

00:06:31.039 --> 00:06:36.620
 there is a good chance that it will burn and 

00:06:33.410 --> 00:06:39.199
 it really was 145 minutes I think and 

00:06:36.620 --> 00:06:41.210
 after 45, I left it covered 

00:06:39.199 --> 00:06:43.520
 so that they are in the steam then 

00:06:41.210 --> 00:06:45.379
 I uncovered it then put it in the fridge 

00:06:43.520 --> 00:06:46.729
 20 more minutes so it's cold like that 

00:06:45.379 --> 00:06:48.979
 I hope you liked this 

00:06:46.729 --> 00:06:53.169
 option was very good and enjoy the 

00:06:48.979 --> 00:06:53.169
 landmark conlusión for its three months
