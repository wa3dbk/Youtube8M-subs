big<00:00:26.519> problem<00:00:26.789> and<00:00:27.150> we're<00:00:27.240> talking<00:00:27.570> about

00:00:27.620 --> 00:00:27.630 
big problem and we're talking about

00:00:27.630 --> 00:00:29.450 
big problem and we're talking about
pasture<00:00:28.170> when<00:00:28.320> we<00:00:28.439> are<00:00:28.560> not<00:00:28.830> doing<00:00:29.070> tillage

00:00:29.450 --> 00:00:29.460 
pasture when we are not doing tillage

00:00:29.460 --> 00:00:31.460 
pasture when we are not doing tillage
when<00:00:29.820> we're<00:00:30.000> not<00:00:30.119> having<00:00:30.570> a<00:00:30.750> lot<00:00:30.840> of<00:00:30.900> annual

00:00:31.460 --> 00:00:31.470 
when we're not having a lot of annual

00:00:31.470 --> 00:00:33.230 
when we're not having a lot of annual
crops<00:00:31.769> out<00:00:31.980> there<00:00:32.130> we<00:00:32.250> don't<00:00:32.430> have<00:00:32.670> as<00:00:32.910> much

00:00:33.230 --> 00:00:33.240 
crops out there we don't have as much

00:00:33.240 --> 00:00:35.210 
crops out there we don't have as much
trouble<00:00:33.540> with<00:00:33.870> annual<00:00:34.380> weeds<00:00:34.590> so<00:00:34.950> the<00:00:35.040> ones

00:00:35.210 --> 00:00:35.220 
trouble with annual weeds so the ones

00:00:35.220 --> 00:00:37.370 
trouble with annual weeds so the ones
that<00:00:35.280> we<00:00:35.430> do<00:00:35.670> have<00:00:35.700> get<00:00:36.300> a<00:00:36.330> great<00:00:36.720> start<00:00:37.020> in<00:00:37.260> the

00:00:37.370 --> 00:00:37.380 
that we do have get a great start in the

00:00:37.380 --> 00:00:39.470 
that we do have get a great start in the
fall<00:00:37.680> they<00:00:38.190> build<00:00:38.490> up<00:00:38.670> a<00:00:38.760> lot<00:00:38.940> of<00:00:38.970> energy<00:00:39.180> in

00:00:39.470 --> 00:00:39.480 
fall they build up a lot of energy in

00:00:39.480 --> 00:00:41.450 
fall they build up a lot of energy in
that<00:00:39.510> big<00:00:40.020> root<00:00:40.320> system<00:00:40.740> and<00:00:40.920> in<00:00:41.040> the<00:00:41.130> spring

00:00:41.450 --> 00:00:41.460 
that big root system and in the spring

00:00:41.460 --> 00:00:43.430 
that big root system and in the spring
they're<00:00:41.790> way<00:00:42.000> ahead<00:00:42.120> of<00:00:42.300> everything<00:00:42.600> else<00:00:42.930> so

00:00:43.430 --> 00:00:43.440 
they're way ahead of everything else so

00:00:43.440 --> 00:00:45.560 
they're way ahead of everything else so
pastures<00:00:43.950> must<00:00:44.310> be<00:00:44.490> dealt<00:00:44.760> with<00:00:44.850> early<00:00:45.360> and

00:00:45.560 --> 00:00:45.570 
pastures must be dealt with early and

00:00:45.570 --> 00:00:47.360 
pastures must be dealt with early and
they<00:00:45.960> also<00:00:46.110> must<00:00:46.410> be<00:00:46.590> dealt<00:00:46.800> with<00:00:46.920> in<00:00:47.070> the<00:00:47.160> fall

00:00:47.360 --> 00:00:47.370 
they also must be dealt with in the fall

00:00:47.370 --> 00:00:49.100 
they also must be dealt with in the fall
and<00:00:47.580> in<00:00:47.790> those<00:00:47.940> two<00:00:48.150> situations<00:00:48.390> we<00:00:48.900> can<00:00:49.020> do<00:00:49.080> a

00:00:49.100 --> 00:00:49.110 
and in those two situations we can do a

00:00:49.110 --> 00:00:51.050 
and in those two situations we can do a
great<00:00:49.530> job<00:00:49.800> with<00:00:50.010> weed<00:00:50.190> control<00:00:50.340> we've<00:00:50.880> never

00:00:51.050 --> 00:00:51.060 
great job with weed control we've never

00:00:51.060 --> 00:00:52.520 
great job with weed control we've never
had<00:00:51.270> more<00:00:51.450> products<00:00:51.900> to<00:00:51.930> choose<00:00:52.200> from<00:00:52.410> than

00:00:52.520 --> 00:00:52.530 
had more products to choose from than

00:00:52.530 --> 00:00:54.710 
had more products to choose from than

do you think the best thing we should do

00:01:00.720 --> 00:01:02.510 
do you think the best thing we should do
in<00:01:01.110> the<00:01:01.290> pasture<00:01:01.710> would<00:01:01.860> be<00:01:01.950> to<00:01:02.070> control<00:01:02.340> that

00:01:02.510 --> 00:01:02.520 
in the pasture would be to control that

00:01:02.520 --> 00:01:04.490 
in the pasture would be to control that

there are few counties in the United

00:04:00.900 --> 00:04:03.560 
there are few counties in the United

00:04:03.560 --> 00:04:03.570 
States where 240 would be restricted so

00:04:03.570 --> 00:04:05.120 
States where 240 would be restricted so
make<00:04:03.720> sure<00:04:03.750> you<00:04:04.019> check<00:04:04.230> what<00:04:04.440> the<00:04:04.560> rules<00:04:04.860> are

00:04:05.120 --> 00:04:05.130

in your county and in your state okay
finally<00:04:08.130> I<00:04:08.160> guess<00:04:08.459> Darren<00:04:08.970> mentioned<00:04:09.120> this

00:04:09.380 --> 00:04:09.390 
finally I guess Darren mentioned this

00:04:09.390 --> 00:04:10.910 
finally I guess Darren mentioned this
already<00:04:09.630> with<00:04:09.900> tort<00:04:10.170> on<00:04:10.290> but<00:04:10.530> I<00:04:10.560> think<00:04:10.769> it's

00:04:10.910 --> 00:04:10.920 
already with tort on but I think it's

00:04:10.920 --> 00:04:13.069 
already with tort on but I think it's
very<00:04:11.370> important<00:04:11.820> to<00:04:11.850> note<00:04:12.060> Orton<00:04:12.510> has<00:04:12.780> come

00:04:13.069 --> 00:04:13.079 
very important to note Orton has come

00:04:13.079 --> 00:04:14.569 
very important to note Orton has come
way<00:04:13.260> down<00:04:13.290> in<00:04:13.650> price<00:04:13.890> so<00:04:14.190> if<00:04:14.310> you<00:04:14.400> thought

00:04:14.569 --> 00:04:14.579 
way down in price so if you thought
