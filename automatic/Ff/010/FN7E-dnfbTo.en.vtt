00:00:18.539 --> 00:00:22.619
 agnostic agent universe or this 

00:00:20.730 --> 00:00:24.560
 question of human existence is how it 

00:00:22.619 --> 00:00:26.670
 that the human being has been positioned and

 these paths are not these diverse 

00:00:30.660 --> 00:00:35.100
 universes that inhabit us in our 

00:00:33.090 --> 00:00:37.380

 relationship with people time relationship 

00:00:42.329 --> 00:00:47.640
 space and the universe people talk about 

00:00:45.239 --> 00:00:50.070
 universe of each universe

 are more fluid parts without parts with more 

00:00:50.070 --> 00:00:55.199
 then it's for really 

00:00:52.559 --> 00:00:56.850
 explore the sensuality in these pieces that 

00:00:55.199 --> 00:00:58.829
 then in our second direction we 

00:00:56.850 --> 00:01:01.379
 we have the universe are the most 

00:00:58.829 --> 00:01:03.930
 more colorful hybrids that bring 

00:01:01.379 --> 00:01:05.519
 volume that bring vibrancy and 

00:01:03.930 --> 00:01:08.369
 universe we do one more thing 

00:01:05.519 --> 00:01:09.240
 clean a more minimalist aesthetics 

00:01:08.369 --> 00:01:12.000
 linear 

00:01:09.240 --> 00:01:14.640
 so we can explore tunics pieces 

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:16.530
 even aiming for comfort as a universe he 

00:01:14.640 --> 00:01:20.009

 colors that apparently you do not 

00:01:21.659 --> 00:01:26.159
 would combine and that we are proposing 

00:01:23.340 --> 00:01:28.200
 these are very irreverent things and
