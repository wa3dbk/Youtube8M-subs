ideally pretty heavy weight maybe like

00:00:39.420 --> 00:00:44.150 
ideally pretty heavy weight maybe like
you're<00:00:39.540> 12<00:00:39.750> rep<00:00:39.960> max<00:00:41.390> signing<00:00:42.390> up<00:00:43.160> sitting

you're 12 rep max signing up sitting

00:00:44.160 --> 00:00:50.660 
you're 12 rep max signing up sitting
down<00:00:44.360> and<00:00:45.360> move<00:00:45.600> again<00:00:49.219> speed<00:00:50.219> isn't<00:00:50.460> that

00:00:50.660 --> 00:00:50.670 
down and move again speed isn't that

00:00:50.670 --> 00:00:51.920 
down and move again speed isn't that
important<00:00:51.180> because<00:00:51.360> you're<00:00:51.660> going<00:00:51.780> to<00:00:51.840> be

developing power you could do them
really<00:00:53.760> quickly<00:00:54.110> however<00:00:55.129> it's<00:00:56.129> not<00:00:56.340> that

00:00:56.479 --> 00:00:56.489 
really quickly however it's not that

00:00:56.489 --> 00:00:57.740

some<00:01:12.060> more<00:01:12.210> power<00:01:13.140> exercises<00:01:13.650> these<00:01:14.130> are

00:01:14.270 --> 00:01:14.280 
some more power exercises these are

00:01:14.280 --> 00:01:16.039 
some more power exercises these are
called<00:01:14.430> plyometrics<00:01:15.210> it's<00:01:15.750> a<00:01:15.810> really

00:01:16.039 --> 00:01:16.049 
called plyometrics it's a really

00:01:16.049 --> 00:01:17.920 
called plyometrics it's a really
standard<00:01:16.470> amongst<00:01:16.920> basketball<00:01:17.310> players

00:01:17.920 --> 00:01:17.930

to<00:01:21.960> quick<00:01:22.409> explosive<00:01:22.890> speed<00:01:23.250> I'm<00:01:23.939> going<00:01:24.090> to

00:01:24.140 --> 00:01:24.150 
to quick explosive speed I'm going to

00:01:24.150 --> 00:01:26.210 
to quick explosive speed I'm going to
show<00:01:24.330> you<00:01:24.390> a<00:01:24.630> very<00:01:24.900> typical<00:01:25.080> plyometric<00:01:25.979> jump

00:01:26.210 --> 00:01:26.220 
show you a very typical plyometric jump

00:01:26.220 --> 00:01:30.870 
show you a very typical plyometric jump
for<00:01:26.490> basketball<00:01:26.759> now

00:01:30.870 --> 00:01:30.880

00:01:33.270 --> 00:01:33.280 
so what you can see where my two-legged

00:01:33.280 --> 00:01:34.740 
so what you can see where my two-legged
front<00:01:33.549> jump<00:01:33.789> I<00:01:33.909> was<00:01:34.000> going<00:01:34.149> as<00:01:34.210> far<00:01:34.420> as<00:01:34.600> I<00:01:34.689> could

00:01:34.740 --> 00:01:34.750 
front jump I was going as far as I could

00:01:34.750 --> 00:01:37.730 
front jump I was going as far as I could
I<00:01:35.079> lose<00:01:35.500> my<00:01:35.680> arms<00:01:36.070> propel<00:01:36.460> myself<00:01:36.640> forward

00:01:37.730 --> 00:01:37.740 
I lose my arms propel myself forward

00:01:37.740 --> 00:01:40.830 
I lose my arms propel myself forward
regenerate<00:01:38.740> as<00:01:38.829> much<00:01:39.130> power<00:01:39.369> as<00:01:39.430> I<00:01:39.610> can<00:01:39.840> okay

00:01:40.830 --> 00:01:40.840 
regenerate as much power as I can okay

00:01:40.840 --> 00:01:42.630 
regenerate as much power as I can okay
now<00:01:41.079> once<00:01:41.259> you've<00:01:41.470> done<00:01:41.710> maybe<00:01:42.220> that<00:01:42.399> for<00:01:42.610> a

00:01:42.630 --> 00:01:42.640 
now once you've done maybe that for a

00:01:42.640 --> 00:01:43.950 
now once you've done maybe that for a
couple<00:01:43.000> of<00:01:43.060> weeks<00:01:43.119> or<00:01:43.390> so<00:01:43.570> and<00:01:43.810> you're

00:01:43.950 --> 00:01:43.960 
couple of weeks or so and you're

00:01:43.960 --> 00:01:45.899 
couple of weeks or so and you're
comfortable<00:01:44.380> with<00:01:44.439> it<00:01:44.619> then<00:01:45.250> you<00:01:45.460> move<00:01:45.610> on<00:01:45.700> to

00:01:45.899 --> 00:01:45.909 
comfortable with it then you move on to

00:01:45.909 --> 00:01:48.300 
comfortable with it then you move on to
a<00:01:45.939> more<00:01:46.000> sports<00:01:46.899> specific<00:01:47.170> type<00:01:47.770> of<00:01:47.799> drill<00:01:48.100> now

00:01:48.300 --> 00:01:48.310 
a more sports specific type of drill now

00:01:48.310 --> 00:01:50.190 
a more sports specific type of drill now
when<00:01:48.429> you<00:01:48.460> dunk<00:01:48.759> you<00:01:49.000> tend<00:01:49.390> to<00:01:49.509> leave<00:01:49.750> lead

00:01:50.190 --> 00:01:50.200 
when you dunk you tend to leave lead

00:01:50.200 --> 00:01:51.809 
when you dunk you tend to leave lead
with<00:01:50.380> one<00:01:50.530> foot<00:01:50.770> so<00:01:51.460> you<00:01:51.520> need<00:01:51.670> to<00:01:51.729> do

00:01:51.809 --> 00:01:51.819 
with one foot so you need to do

00:01:51.819 --> 00:01:53.669 
with one foot so you need to do
exercises<00:01:52.270> where<00:01:52.539> you<00:01:52.630> jump<00:01:52.869> using<00:01:53.140> just<00:01:53.470> one

00:01:53.669 --> 00:01:53.679 
exercises where you jump using just one

00:01:53.679 --> 00:01:55.770 
exercises where you jump using just one
leg<00:01:53.920> so<00:01:54.700> you<00:01:54.759> go<00:01:54.939> into<00:01:55.149> a<00:01:55.179> one-legged

00:01:55.770 --> 00:01:55.780 
leg so you go into a one-legged

00:01:55.780 --> 00:02:00.779 
leg so you go into a one-legged
plyometric<00:01:56.439> jump<00:01:56.679> asking<00:01:57.399> you<00:01:57.490> seen<00:01:57.700> here<00:01:59.789> I'm

plyometric jump asking you seen here I'm

00:02:00.789 --> 00:02:02.130 
plyometric jump asking you seen here I'm
jumping<00:02:01.149> on<00:02:01.240> one<00:02:01.329> leg<00:02:01.509> and<00:02:01.630> I'm<00:02:01.720> landing<00:02:02.049> on

00:02:02.130 --> 00:02:02.140 
jumping on one leg and I'm landing on

00:02:02.140 --> 00:02:04.080 
jumping on one leg and I'm landing on
one<00:02:02.259> leg<00:02:02.439> I<00:02:02.679> want<00:02:03.250> to<00:02:03.280> do<00:02:03.369> it<00:02:03.459> on<00:02:03.549> both<00:02:03.729> sides

00:02:04.080 --> 00:02:04.090 
one leg I want to do it on both sides

00:02:04.090 --> 00:02:06.029 
one leg I want to do it on both sides
otherwise<00:02:04.659> you'll<00:02:04.929> be<00:02:04.959> too<00:02:05.500> dominant<00:02:05.950> on<00:02:06.009> the

00:02:06.029 --> 00:02:06.039 
otherwise you'll be too dominant on the

00:02:06.039 --> 00:02:08.910 
otherwise you'll be too dominant on the
right<00:02:06.250> on<00:02:06.399> that<00:02:06.520> side<00:02:07.049> so<00:02:08.049> to<00:02:08.080> recap<00:02:08.289> if<00:02:08.830> you

00:02:08.910 --> 00:02:08.920 
right on that side so to recap if you

00:02:08.920 --> 00:02:10.979 
right on that side so to recap if you
want<00:02:09.069> to<00:02:09.130> dunk<00:02:09.280> better<00:02:09.700> for<00:02:10.000> basketball<00:02:10.299> you

00:02:10.979 --> 00:02:10.989 
want to dunk better for basketball you

00:02:10.989 --> 00:02:13.530 
want to dunk better for basketball you
get<00:02:11.200> stronger<00:02:11.500> then<00:02:12.370> you<00:02:12.459> get<00:02:12.549> more<00:02:12.670> power<00:02:12.910> and

00:02:13.530 --> 00:02:13.540 
get stronger then you get more power and

00:02:13.540 --> 00:02:15.270 
get stronger then you get more power and
finally<00:02:14.110> you<00:02:14.140> get<00:02:14.319> more<00:02:14.470> specific<00:02:14.709> power

00:02:15.270 --> 00:02:15.280 
finally you get more specific power

00:02:15.280 --> 00:02:19.319 
finally you get more specific power
which<00:02:15.610> is<00:02:15.760> a<00:02:15.790> one-legged<00:02:16.299> plyometric<00:02:17.080> jump
