00:01:20.809 --> 00:01:20.819 
same with PCI Express you just need only

00:01:20.819 --> 00:01:23.779

it's<00:01:24.109> 5770<00:01:25.109> radeon<00:01:25.759> so<00:01:26.840> and<00:01:27.840> the<00:01:28.499> same<00:01:28.679> story

00:01:28.969 --> 00:01:28.979 
it's 5770 radeon so and the same story

00:01:28.979 --> 00:01:33.230 
it's 5770 radeon so and the same story
with<00:01:29.189> the<00:01:29.539> HP<00:01:30.539> in<00:01:30.869> cable<00:01:31.319> this<00:01:32.279> power<00:01:32.819> supply

00:01:33.230 --> 00:01:33.240 
with the HP in cable this power supply

00:01:33.240 --> 00:01:37.249 
with the HP in cable this power supply
it's<00:01:33.419> actually<00:01:33.859> not<00:01:34.909> 100%<00:01:35.909> modular<00:01:36.389> like<00:01:36.869> most

00:01:37.249 --> 00:01:37.259 
it's actually not 100% modular like most

00:01:37.259 --> 00:01:41.029 
it's actually not 100% modular like most
of<00:01:37.469> them<00:01:38.240> those<00:01:39.240> cables<00:01:39.749> here<00:01:40.079> are<00:01:40.319> modular

00:01:41.029 --> 00:01:41.039 
of them those cables here are modular

00:01:41.039 --> 00:01:43.720 
of them those cables here are modular
but<00:01:41.490> they<00:01:42.029> not<00:01:42.209> here<00:01:42.569> so

00:01:43.720 --> 00:01:43.730 
but they not here so

00:01:43.730 --> 00:01:46.900 
but they not here so
you<00:01:44.300> have<00:01:44.510> your<00:01:44.780> 8-pin<00:01:45.620> goink<00:01:46.010> right<00:01:46.250> here<00:01:46.640> and

00:01:46.900 --> 00:01:46.910 
you have your 8-pin goink right here and

00:01:46.910 --> 00:01:48.910 
you have your 8-pin goink right here and
you<00:01:47.150> don't<00:01:47.330> have<00:01:47.540> really<00:01:47.720> you<00:01:48.050> don't<00:01:48.770> have<00:01:48.800> a

00:01:48.910 --> 00:01:48.920 
you don't have really you don't have a

you don't have really you don't have a
space<00:01:49.190> to<00:01:49.460> hide<00:01:49.700> this<00:01:49.910> table<00:01:50.360> so<00:01:50.510> you<00:01:50.540> have

00:01:50.800 --> 00:01:50.810 
space to hide this table so you have

00:01:50.810 --> 00:01:54.250 
space to hide this table so you have
just<00:01:51.730> you<00:01:52.730> know<00:01:52.790> I<00:01:52.880> type<00:01:53.300> this<00:01:53.570> cable<00:01:54.080> right

00:01:54.250 --> 00:01:54.260 
just you know I type this cable right

00:01:54.260 --> 00:01:56.290 
just you know I type this cable right
here<00:01:54.290> to<00:01:54.680> the<00:01:54.770> expansion<00:01:55.070> slots<00:01:55.640> which<00:01:55.880> is<00:01:56.030> you

00:01:56.290 --> 00:01:56.300 
here to the expansion slots which is you

00:01:56.300 --> 00:01:59.860 
here to the expansion slots which is you
know<00:01:56.330> not<00:01:56.450> professional<00:01:57.350> but<00:01:57.530> it's<00:01:58.840> doing<00:01:59.840> the

00:01:59.860 --> 00:01:59.870 
know not professional but it's doing the

00:01:59.870 --> 00:02:03.760 
know not professional but it's doing the
job<00:02:00.050> okay<00:02:01.840> s.o<00:02:02.840> their<00:02:03.050> flow<00:02:03.290> should<00:02:03.470> be<00:02:03.590> pretty

00:02:03.760 --> 00:02:03.770 
job okay s.o their flow should be pretty

00:02:03.770 --> 00:02:07.660 
job okay s.o their flow should be pretty
good<00:02:03.890> the<00:02:04.850> same<00:02:05.030> story<00:02:05.360> with<00:02:05.600> the<00:02:06.280> career<00:02:07.280> fan

00:02:07.660 --> 00:02:07.670 
good the same story with the career fan

00:02:07.670 --> 00:02:12.610 
good the same story with the career fan
and<00:02:08.030> the<00:02:08.270> top<00:02:08.630> fan<00:02:08.990> 40<00:02:09.950> millimeter<00:02:11.620> the

00:02:12.610 --> 00:02:12.620 
and the top fan 40 millimeter the

00:02:12.620 --> 00:02:15.220 
and the top fan 40 millimeter the
connectors<00:02:13.130> are<00:02:13.340> molex<00:02:13.820> not<00:02:14.450> three<00:02:14.780> pins<00:02:15.050> so

00:02:15.220 --> 00:02:15.230 
connectors are molex not three pins so

00:02:15.230 --> 00:02:16.570 
connectors are molex not three pins so
you<00:02:15.350> can't<00:02:15.560> connect<00:02:15.890> them<00:02:16.040> straight<00:02:16.340> to<00:02:16.370> the

00:02:16.570 --> 00:02:16.580 
you can't connect them straight to the

00:02:16.580 --> 00:02:18.520 
you can't connect them straight to the
motherboard<00:02:16.820> you<00:02:17.660> need<00:02:17.810> to<00:02:17.990> connect<00:02:18.290> them<00:02:18.410> to

00:02:18.520 --> 00:02:18.530 
motherboard you need to connect them to

00:02:18.530 --> 00:02:20.770 
motherboard you need to connect them to
Molech<00:02:18.740> so<00:02:19.190> I<00:02:19.220> hide<00:02:19.670> them<00:02:20.030> behind<00:02:20.060> the

00:02:20.770 --> 00:02:20.780 
Molech so I hide them behind the

00:02:20.780 --> 00:02:22.990 
Molech so I hide them behind the
motherboard<00:02:21.260> right<00:02:21.500> here<00:02:21.890> and<00:02:22.100> they<00:02:22.970> are

00:02:22.990 --> 00:02:23.000 
motherboard right here and they are

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:28.030 
motherboard right here and they are
connecting<00:02:23.750> and<00:02:23.990> this<00:02:24.260> hole<00:02:24.530> right<00:02:24.770> there<00:02:27.040> so

00:02:28.030 --> 00:02:28.040 
connecting and this hole right there so

00:02:28.040 --> 00:02:29.320 
connecting and this hole right there so
yeah<00:02:28.190> the<00:02:28.310> Air<00:02:28.430> Force<00:02:28.670> should<00:02:28.790> be<00:02:28.910> pretty<00:02:29.030> good

00:02:29.320 --> 00:02:29.330 
yeah the Air Force should be pretty good

00:02:29.330 --> 00:02:33.940 
yeah the Air Force should be pretty good
we<00:02:30.140> do<00:02:30.320> use<00:02:30.530> the<00:02:30.830> standard<00:02:31.160> viewer<00:02:32.000> for<00:02:32.270> now<00:02:32.950> we

00:02:33.940 --> 00:02:33.950 
we do use the standard viewer for now we

00:02:33.950 --> 00:02:36.490 
we do use the standard viewer for now we
just<00:02:33.980> wait<00:02:34.310> for<00:02:34.370> the<00:02:34.730> new<00:02:34.850> ones<00:02:35.090> so<00:02:35.390> i<00:02:35.660> will

00:02:36.490 --> 00:02:36.500 
just wait for the new ones so i will

00:02:36.500 --> 00:02:40.360 
just wait for the new ones so i will
probably<00:02:36.740> make<00:02:37.100> a<00:02:37.160> video<00:02:37.430> about<00:02:37.760> it<00:02:38.180> but<00:02:39.370> that

00:02:40.360 --> 00:02:40.370 
probably make a video about it but that

00:02:40.370 --> 00:02:43.660 
probably make a video about it but that
how<00:02:40.640> it<00:02:40.790> looks<00:02:41.060> after<00:02:41.650> you<00:02:42.650> know<00:02:42.770> less<00:02:43.640> than

00:02:43.660 --> 00:02:43.670 
how it looks after you know less than

00:02:43.670 --> 00:02:48.940 
how it looks after you know less than
two<00:02:44.030> hours<00:02:44.180> of<00:02:44.360> work<00:02:46.060> have<00:02:47.060> your<00:02:47.470> fan<00:02:48.470> speeds

00:02:48.940 --> 00:02:48.950 
two hours of work have your fan speeds
