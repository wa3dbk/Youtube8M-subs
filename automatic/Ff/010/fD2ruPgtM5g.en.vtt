week against Everton they went too bad

00:00:41.730 --> 00:00:43.460

no<00:00:41.910> they<00:00:42.150> were<00:00:42.270> fine<00:00:42.480> I<00:00:42.720> mean<00:00:42.900> Everton<00:00:43.260> weren't

00:00:43.460 --> 00:00:43.470 
no they were fine I mean Everton weren't

00:00:43.470 --> 00:00:46.510 
no they were fine I mean Everton weren't
any<00:00:43.590> great<00:00:43.860> shakes<00:00:43.890> but<00:00:44.490> ports<00:00:45.180> were<00:00:45.300> clearly

00:00:46.510 --> 00:00:46.520 
any great shakes but ports were clearly

00:00:46.520 --> 00:00:48.290 
any great shakes but ports were clearly
definitely<00:00:47.520> deserve<00:00:47.790> to<00:00:47.910> draw<00:00:48.060> out<00:00:48.090> of

00:00:48.290 --> 00:00:48.300 
definitely deserve to draw out of

00:00:48.300 --> 00:00:49.670 
definitely deserve to draw out of
probably<00:00:48.660> in<00:00:48.750> the<00:00:48.810> right<00:00:48.990> result<00:00:49.350> and<00:00:49.530> if<00:00:49.590> you

00:00:49.670 --> 00:00:49.680 
probably in the right result and if you

00:00:49.680 --> 00:00:51.140 
probably in the right result and if you
just<00:00:49.800> said<00:00:49.980> anyone<00:00:50.310> should<00:00:50.550> make<00:00:50.760> it<00:00:50.880> then<00:00:51.030> it

00:00:51.140 --> 00:00:51.150 
just said anyone should make it then it

00:00:51.150 --> 00:00:52.810 
just said anyone should make it then it
would<00:00:51.450> probably<00:00:51.660> be<00:00:51.810> important<00:00:52.320> there<00:00:52.440> three

00:00:52.810 --> 00:00:52.820 
would probably be important there three

00:00:52.820 --> 00:00:55.250 
would probably be important there three
absolute<00:00:53.820> gilt-edged<00:00:54.240> chances<00:00:54.750> didn't<00:00:55.080> take

00:00:55.250 --> 00:00:55.260 
absolute gilt-edged chances didn't take

00:00:55.260 --> 00:00:58.420 
absolute gilt-edged chances didn't take
any<00:00:55.470> of<00:00:55.590> them<00:00:55.770> and<00:00:56.280> found<00:00:56.580> themselves<00:00:56.790> um

00:00:58.420 --> 00:00:58.430 
any of them and found themselves um

00:00:58.430 --> 00:01:00.470 
any of them and found themselves um
losing<00:00:59.430> again<00:00:59.610> before<00:00:59.730> we<00:00:59.910> should<00:01:00.150> never<00:01:00.270> have

00:01:00.470 --> 00:01:00.480 
losing again before we should never have

00:01:00.480 --> 00:01:02.330 
losing again before we should never have
lost<00:01:00.660> and<00:01:01.080> they<00:01:01.320> did<00:01:01.680> all<00:01:01.800> right<00:01:01.830> for<00:01:01.950> me<00:01:02.130> not

00:01:02.330 --> 00:01:02.340 
lost and they did all right for me not

00:01:02.340 --> 00:01:04.039 
lost and they did all right for me not
so<00:01:02.550> there<00:01:02.880> was<00:01:02.970> nothing<00:01:03.120> that<00:01:03.330> game<00:01:03.630> going

00:01:04.039 --> 00:01:04.049

wolves<00:02:00.329> at<00:02:00.450> home<00:02:00.659> I<00:02:00.929> think<00:02:01.709> we'll<00:02:02.100> always<00:02:02.299> will

00:02:03.289 --> 00:02:03.299 
wolves at home I think we'll always will

00:02:03.299 --> 00:02:04.940 
wolves at home I think we'll always will
always<00:02:03.450> be<00:02:03.600> a<00:02:03.630> threat<00:02:03.659> going<00:02:04.409> forward<00:02:04.679> you

00:02:04.940 --> 00:02:04.950 
always be a threat going forward you

00:02:04.950 --> 00:02:07.459 
always be a threat going forward you
know<00:02:05.310> that<00:02:05.520> there<00:02:05.700> is<00:02:06.329> largely<00:02:06.810> based<00:02:06.959> upon

00:02:07.459 --> 00:02:07.469 
know that there is largely based upon

00:02:07.469 --> 00:02:08.930 
know that there is largely based upon
attacking<00:02:07.950> now<00:02:08.369> they're<00:02:08.520> not<00:02:08.670> they're<00:02:08.910> not

00:02:08.930 --> 00:02:08.940 
attacking now they're not they're not

00:02:08.940 --> 00:02:11.900 
attacking now they're not they're not
particular<00:02:09.479> on<00:02:09.690> the<00:02:09.810> back<00:02:10.310> so<00:02:11.310> this<00:02:11.520> this<00:02:11.760> will

00:02:11.900 --> 00:02:11.910 
particular on the back so this this will

00:02:11.910 --> 00:02:13.190 
particular on the back so this this will
be<00:02:12.060> it<00:02:12.150> I<00:02:12.330> think<00:02:12.689> this<00:02:12.780> would<00:02:12.930> be<00:02:12.959> a<00:02:13.049> very

00:02:13.190 --> 00:02:13.200 
be it I think this would be a very

00:02:13.200 --> 00:02:14.690 
be it I think this would be a very
decent<00:02:13.439> game<00:02:13.769> I've<00:02:13.920> got<00:02:14.069> a<00:02:14.099> site<00:02:14.310> it<00:02:14.519> should<00:02:14.670> be

00:02:14.690 --> 00:02:14.700 
decent game I've got a site it should be

00:02:14.700 --> 00:02:16.039 
decent game I've got a site it should be
an<00:02:14.939> interesting<00:02:15.239> game<00:02:15.510> while<00:02:15.750> we<00:02:15.840> think

00:02:16.039 --> 00:02:16.049 
an interesting game while we think

00:02:16.049 --> 00:02:17.600 
an interesting game while we think
there's<00:02:16.170> a<00:02:16.230> case<00:02:16.409> of<00:02:16.620> Portsmouth<00:02:17.010> here<00:02:17.189> too

Sunderland yeah and this is also going

00:02:46.260 --> 00:02:47.900 
Sunderland yeah and this is also going
that<00:02:46.590> Portsmouth<00:02:47.040> have<00:02:47.160> got<00:02:47.340> to<00:02:47.520> go<00:02:47.670> and<00:02:47.820> get

00:02:47.900 --> 00:02:47.910 
that Portsmouth have got to go and get

that Portsmouth have got to go and get
something<00:02:48.150> from<00:02:48.510> I<00:02:48.780> think<00:02:49.170> i<00:02:49.530> need<00:02:49.740> to<00:02:49.770> score

00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:50.010 
something from I think i need to score

00:02:50.010 --> 00:02:53.210 
something from I think i need to score
to<00:02:50.250> get<00:02:50.370> a<00:02:50.400> draw<00:02:50.610> out<00:02:50.790> of<00:02:50.880> this<00:02:50.970> game<00:02:51.209> I<00:02:52.080> I<00:02:52.709> just

00:02:53.210 --> 00:02:53.220 
to get a draw out of this game I I just

00:02:53.220 --> 00:02:55.760 
to get a draw out of this game I I just
think<00:02:53.430> I<00:02:53.580> don't<00:02:53.820> see<00:02:54.060> where<00:02:54.709> it's<00:02:55.709> very

00:02:55.760 --> 00:02:55.770 
think I don't see where it's very

00:02:55.770 --> 00:02:56.960 
think I don't see where it's very
difficult<00:02:56.040> to<00:02:56.190> see<00:02:56.340> what<00:02:56.520> either<00:02:56.640> of<00:02:56.850> these

00:02:56.960 --> 00:02:56.970 
difficult to see what either of these

00:02:56.970 --> 00:02:59.510 
difficult to see what either of these
teams<00:02:57.239> go<00:02:57.570> if<00:02:58.260> I<00:02:58.530> them<00:02:58.770> lose<00:02:58.980> this<00:02:59.130> game<00:02:59.340> of

00:02:59.510 --> 00:02:59.520 
teams go if I them lose this game of

00:02:59.520 --> 00:03:01.580 
teams go if I them lose this game of
football<00:02:59.700> and<00:03:00.060> I<00:03:00.510> just<00:03:00.930> think<00:03:01.080> if<00:03:01.170> one's<00:03:01.380> get

00:03:01.580 --> 00:03:01.590 
football and I just think if one's get

00:03:01.590 --> 00:03:03.110 
football and I just think if one's get
it<00:03:01.709> possible<00:03:02.190> to<00:03:02.250> get<00:03:02.340> beaten<00:03:02.580> on<00:03:02.730> this<00:03:02.880> one's

00:03:03.110 --> 00:03:03.120 
it possible to get beaten on this one's

00:03:03.120 --> 00:03:05.199 
it possible to get beaten on this one's
people<00:03:03.420> will<00:03:03.750> start<00:03:04.020> to<00:03:04.080> give<00:03:04.350> up<00:03:04.470> yeah

00:03:05.199 --> 00:03:05.209 
people will start to give up yeah

00:03:05.209 --> 00:03:07.190 
people will start to give up yeah
whereas<00:03:06.209> the<00:03:06.300> forms<00:03:06.570> get<00:03:06.720> bate<00:03:06.900> I<00:03:06.989> think

00:03:07.190 --> 00:03:07.200 
whereas the forms get bate I think

00:03:07.200 --> 00:03:08.540 
whereas the forms get bate I think
people<00:03:07.500> will<00:03:07.620> then<00:03:07.860> start<00:03:07.980> to<00:03:08.280> ask<00:03:08.400> questions

00:03:08.540 --> 00:03:08.550 
people will then start to ask questions

00:03:08.550 --> 00:03:10.910 
people will then start to ask questions
so<00:03:09.030> this<00:03:09.209> is<00:03:09.360> a<00:03:09.390> massive<00:03:10.050> massive<00:03:10.080> going<00:03:10.739> for

00:03:10.910 --> 00:03:10.920 
so this is a massive massive going for

00:03:10.920 --> 00:03:13.880 
so this is a massive massive going for
both<00:03:11.070> these<00:03:11.220> so<00:03:11.370> I<00:03:11.430> particular<00:03:12.270> that<00:03:12.709> would<00:03:13.709> we

00:03:13.880 --> 00:03:13.890 
both these so I particular that would we

00:03:13.890 --> 00:03:15.800 
both these so I particular that would we
