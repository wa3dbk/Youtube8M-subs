00:00:01.860 --> 00:00:06.309
 found with a new video 

00:00:03.290 --> 00:00:06.309
 [Music] 

00:00:09.299 --> 00:00:13.330
 it's been a long time since I've put my 

00:00:11.920 --> 00:00:16.260
 camera like that and that I did a 

00:00:13.330 --> 00:00:18.310
 video in quotes with the ar h20 genre 

00:00:16.260 --> 00:00:22.300
 that I had not really planned to do 

00:00:18.310 --> 00:00:23.800
 in my planning here excuse me there me 

00:00:22.300 --> 00:00:25.210
 have to organize never actually I was 

00:00:23.800 --> 00:00:26.610
 on my phone I was looking for 

00:00:25.210 --> 00:00:28.840
 video ideas 

00:00:26.610 --> 00:00:31.990
 I was on my notes and I had seen a 

00:00:28.840 --> 00:00:34.180
 list of shoes that I will buy 

00:00:31.990 --> 00:00:35.710
 genre that I absolutely had 

00:00:34.180 --> 00:00:37.809
 machete and I thought why not 

00:00:35.710 --> 00:00:41.289
 you make a video wishlist shoes 

00:00:37.809 --> 00:00:42.819

 youtube I've never even seen that on you 

00:00:42.819 --> 00:00:47.649
 tube and I think that may interest 

00:00:46.059 --> 00:00:49.960
 more than one because I think I do not 

00:00:47.649 --> 00:00:51.489

00:00:49.960 --> 00:00:53.469

 I engraved hesitated between pumas suede 

00:02:36.340 --> 00:02:38.890
 turquoise 

00:02:37.750 --> 00:02:40.239
 Finally, I would put you way of 

00:02:38.890 --> 00:02:41.800

00:02:40.239 --> 00:02:43.630

 somewhere on the info bar screen 

00:02:48.310 --> 00:02:53.950
 it is however in fact all ages 

00:02:49.780 --> 00:02:56.260
 gold the white swan it is black to them all 

00:02:53.950 --> 00:02:58.180
 the world has them and I do not want it 

00:02:56.260 --> 00:03:00.910
 I think in pale pink or something like 

00:02:58.180 --> 00:03:02.739
 that it could do either they are 

00:03:00.910 --> 00:03:05.830

 but hey it is the yellow door 

00:03:35.920 --> 00:03:40.360
 nothing at all and I think yellow 

00:03:38.530 --> 00:03:41.650

00:03:40.360 --> 00:03:43.959

00:03:49.450 --> 00:03:51.940
 I lost them I do not know where I 

00:03:51.370 --> 00:03:55.129
 excluded 

00:03:51.940 --> 00:04:00.659
