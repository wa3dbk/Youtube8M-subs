this<00:06:27.259> for<00:06:27.409> comparison<00:06:27.500> I<00:06:27.889> bring<00:06:28.130> in<00:06:28.250> this<00:06:28.460> is

00:06:28.629 --> 00:06:28.639 
this for comparison I bring in this is

00:06:28.639 --> 00:06:37.959 
this for comparison I bring in this is
the<00:06:29.680> Mattel<00:06:33.969> DC<00:06:34.969> Universe<00:06:36.789> Batman<00:06:37.789> from

00:06:37.959 --> 00:06:37.969 
the Mattel DC Universe Batman from

00:06:37.969 --> 00:06:39.519 
the Mattel DC Universe Batman from
Arkham<00:06:38.389> City<00:06:38.630> this<00:06:38.719> one<00:06:38.930> that<00:06:39.050> came<00:06:39.199> in<00:06:39.229> the

00:06:39.519 --> 00:06:39.529 
Arkham City this one that came in the

00:06:39.529 --> 00:06:41.140 
Arkham City this one that came in the
two-face<00:06:39.979> to<00:06:40.190> pack

00:06:41.140 --> 00:06:41.150 
two-face to pack

00:06:41.150 --> 00:06:43.780 
two-face to pack
but<00:06:41.330> can<00:06:41.480> be<00:06:41.600> a<00:06:41.630> good<00:06:41.780> comparison<00:06:42.080> I<00:06:42.790> think

00:06:43.780 --> 00:06:43.790 
but can be a good comparison I think

00:06:43.790 --> 00:06:45.700 
but can be a good comparison I think
this<00:06:44.090> the<00:06:44.570> the<00:06:44.780> obviously<00:06:45.080> I<00:06:45.170> think<00:06:45.350> this<00:06:45.560> is<00:06:45.680> a

00:06:45.700 --> 00:06:45.710 
this the the obviously I think this is a

00:06:45.710 --> 00:06:47.110 
this the the obviously I think this is a
superior<00:06:46.130> looking<00:06:46.550> Batman

00:06:47.110 --> 00:06:47.120 
superior looking Batman

00:06:47.120 --> 00:06:49.960 
superior looking Batman
the<00:06:47.420> colors<00:06:47.780> are<00:06:47.930> better<00:06:48.190> this<00:06:49.190> one<00:06:49.400> it's<00:06:49.640> kind

00:06:49.960 --> 00:06:49.970 
the colors are better this one it's kind

00:06:49.970 --> 00:06:52.390 
the colors are better this one it's kind
of<00:06:50.030> cool<00:06:50.180> you<00:06:50.270> can<00:06:50.360> see<00:06:50.510> the<00:06:50.630> texture<00:06:51.020> of<00:06:51.400> his

00:06:52.390 --> 00:06:52.400 
of cool you can see the texture of his

00:06:52.400 --> 00:06:54.370 
of cool you can see the texture of his
suit<00:06:52.640> in<00:06:52.760> here<00:06:53.000> but<00:06:53.960> I<00:06:53.990> think<00:06:54.170> it<00:06:54.230> kind<00:06:54.350> of

00:06:54.370 --> 00:06:54.380 
suit in here but I think it kind of

00:06:54.380 --> 00:06:55.870 
suit in here but I think it kind of
throws<00:06:54.620> off<00:06:54.860> I<00:06:55.040> think<00:06:55.130> I<00:06:55.250> look<00:06:55.610> better<00:06:55.700> when

00:06:55.870 --> 00:06:55.880 
throws off I think I look better when

00:06:55.880 --> 00:06:57.130 
throws off I think I look better when
she's<00:06:56.000> a<00:06:56.060> little<00:06:56.090> more<00:06:56.330> muted<00:06:56.690> this<00:06:56.780> is<00:06:56.930> of<00:06:57.050> how

00:06:57.130 --> 00:06:57.140 
she's a little more muted this is of how

00:06:57.140 --> 00:07:03.370 
she's a little more muted this is of how
well<00:06:57.350> shiny<00:06:58.690> so<00:07:01.360> then<00:07:02.360> of<00:07:02.450> course<00:07:02.630> the<00:07:03.170> face

00:07:03.370 --> 00:07:03.380 
well shiny so then of course the face

00:07:03.380 --> 00:07:05.590 
well shiny so then of course the face
was<00:07:03.590> good<00:07:03.800> in<00:07:03.920> this<00:07:04.070> one<00:07:04.280> it's<00:07:05.060> a<00:07:05.150> lot<00:07:05.330> better
