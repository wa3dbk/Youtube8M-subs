00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.959
 hello to youtube efe mc and today I come 

00:00:02.310 --> 00:00:07.799
 teach them how to install gravity with 

00:00:03.959 --> 00:00:09.990
 to mark 1 point 6.2 we go to the 

00:00:07.799 --> 00:00:15.200
 description of the video and we will have this 

00:00:09.990 --> 00:00:15.200
 page we are going to that the download part 

00:00:15.250 --> 00:00:22.869
 and here we are going to download the mod the serious 

00:00:19.600 --> 00:00:27.369
 cornada in this case version 2.0 

00:00:22.869 --> 00:00:29.470
 point 0 and you need the itunes has made a 

00:00:27.369 --> 00:00:31.119
 Useful 

00:00:29.470 --> 00:00:32.739
 for the same version they have to 

00:00:31.119 --> 00:00:35.860
 download it then in this case it would be 

00:00:32.739 --> 00:00:38.980
 I already downloaded them that are these 

00:00:35.860 --> 00:00:43.300
 two then we're going to app percentage 

00:00:38.980 --> 00:00:47.739
 data percentage to roaming place kia 

00:00:43.300 --> 00:00:50.470
 point minecraft and here as in the east 

00:00:47.739 --> 00:00:54.040
 mod need force then in this 

00:00:50.470 --> 00:00:56.230
 side and track to the corner will appear 

00:00:54.040 --> 00:00:58.269
 link where they can go see the 

00:00:56.230 --> 00:01:02.040
 installation of the force for microphone 

00:00:58.269 --> 00:01:03.970
 point 6.2 for any the launcher 

00:01:02.040 --> 00:01:06.250
 it will also be in the description of 

00:01:03.970 --> 00:01:08.950
 video then what we do is 

00:01:06.250 --> 00:01:13.090
 drag these two here folder 

00:01:08.950 --> 00:01:17.340
 mods we close and go to our launcher 

00:01:13.090 --> 00:01:17.340
 in this case I will use the main softec 

00:01:18.700 --> 00:01:23.710
 but total works with any launcher 

00:01:20.710 --> 00:01:28.740
 it's the same then here we select 

00:01:23.710 --> 00:01:31.979
 the one that loads first 

00:01:28.740 --> 00:01:34.740
 and here we select the force option 

00:01:31.979 --> 00:01:37.250
 we give here and hope to play 

00:01:34.740 --> 00:01:39.430
 load the game 

00:01:37.250 --> 00:01:43.960
 so here we go to a player 

00:01:39.430 --> 00:01:43.960
 here to this world that I already had prepared 

00:01:47.710 --> 00:01:53.590
 then as you see here is the gravity 

00:01:50.799 --> 00:01:55.540
 with these two are the ones that deliver us 

00:01:53.590 --> 00:01:58.990
 a the super charger and the salt the normal 

00:01:55.540 --> 00:02:00.790
 which is the easiest to do then it 

00:01:58.990 --> 00:02:03.850
 does with two iron ingots in the 

00:02:00.790 --> 00:02:07.690
 four pearls corners to sell one 

00:02:03.850 --> 00:02:09.520
 close with a stone of klaus and knox and 

00:02:07.690 --> 00:02:15.190
 diana and a diamond or is it really is 

00:02:09.520 --> 00:02:17.410
 very cheap and very useful here we can catch 

00:02:15.190 --> 00:02:19.840
 let's say we are here then we can 

00:02:17.410 --> 00:02:26.440
 catch four blocks or five one two 

00:02:19.840 --> 00:02:30.970
 three four and five there as they see with 

00:02:26.440 --> 00:02:33.520
 right click you run the blocks and 

00:02:30.970 --> 00:02:36.770
 with that same they are released but they are going to 

00:02:33.520 --> 00:02:39.980
 drop in this way and fall 

00:02:36.770 --> 00:02:43.660
 to launch them anyway we have to 

00:02:39.980 --> 00:02:47.730
 it's just select with the right click 

00:02:43.660 --> 00:02:51.360
 and we release them with the left click 

00:02:47.730 --> 00:02:54.390
 and it goes flying away far away here the 

00:02:51.360 --> 00:02:57.370
 the supercharger is much more that is 

00:02:54.390 --> 00:03:00.010
 more ability to launch 

00:02:57.370 --> 00:03:05.379
 and to pick up I think only one block 

00:03:00.010 --> 00:03:08.220
 more or less here is created with the same 

00:03:05.379 --> 00:03:10.819
 except for the star of 

00:03:08.220 --> 00:03:12.709
 bounce widder 

00:03:10.819 --> 00:03:15.530
 and well you're made a little more expensive 

00:03:12.709 --> 00:03:17.389
 but also a way to load the one 

00:03:15.530 --> 00:03:21.139
 if lightning strikes 

00:03:17.389 --> 00:03:24.129
 so we are struck by lightning having the 

00:03:21.139 --> 00:03:26.659
 gravity with which is very very 

00:03:24.129 --> 00:03:29.200
 complicated that we are struck by lightning 

00:03:26.659 --> 00:03:29.200
 Minecraft 

00:03:29.670 --> 00:03:33.110
 but also 

00:03:33.250 --> 00:03:38.230
 it is the same you are selected with tyc 

00:03:35.140 --> 00:03:39.860
 right and we vote with the click 

00:03:38.230 --> 00:03:41.570
 left 

00:03:39.860 --> 00:03:43.270
 as good now I show you how 

00:03:41.570 --> 00:03:48.130
 I arrive 

00:03:43.270 --> 00:03:50.050
 1 2 3 4 5 6 as you see I got that jump 

00:03:48.130 --> 00:03:52.360
 but I grabbed it then it has a 

00:03:50.050 --> 00:03:55.140
 capacity of a block more let's see 

00:03:52.360 --> 00:03:55.140
 how far to get 

00:04:04.100 --> 00:04:17.260
 they got quite far 123456789 many 

00:04:14.420 --> 00:04:17.260
 how can you see 

00:04:18.019 --> 00:04:21.370
 It's super big 

00:04:24.600 --> 00:04:29.820
 and well here let's say the utility more than 

00:04:28.230 --> 00:04:32.190
 everything for that good although it has 

00:04:29.820 --> 00:04:34.460
 lots of utilities if one goes by the 

00:04:32.190 --> 00:04:37.910
 widder 

00:04:34.460 --> 00:04:42.789
 it serves too much in this case we're going to 

00:04:37.910 --> 00:04:42.789
 catch a skeleton spoiler 

00:04:55.870 --> 00:04:59.100
 telethon 

00:05:00.190 --> 00:05:06.729
 do not put here on easy difficulty thing 

00:05:04.450 --> 00:05:10.419
 that is destroyed 

00:05:06.729 --> 00:05:13.089
 many many then here what 

00:05:10.419 --> 00:05:15.129
 we can do is select the and try 

00:05:13.089 --> 00:05:18.719
 to enter the net 

00:05:15.129 --> 00:05:18.719
 with exhibiting 

00:05:26.350 --> 00:05:32.350
 well here I entered then here the 

00:05:28.750 --> 00:05:34.450
 idea is to place it in a safe place 

00:05:32.350 --> 00:05:38.720
 good if you want you can place it here 

00:05:34.450 --> 00:05:41.270
 build after a fortress d 

00:05:38.720 --> 00:05:43.360
 a fort with any material that 

00:05:41.270 --> 00:05:47.140
 so that gas does not destroy them 

00:05:43.360 --> 00:05:47.140
 then here let's say 

00:05:47.420 --> 00:05:52.569
 good to place anywhere it does not matter 

00:05:51.129 --> 00:05:55.080
 here 

00:05:52.569 --> 00:05:57.129
 then as wildlife versions the 

00:05:55.080 --> 00:05:59.169
 skeletons these from hell the 

00:05:57.129 --> 00:06:01.960
 skeletons 

00:05:59.169 --> 00:06:03.520
 and well the idea is this they are going to 

00:06:01.960 --> 00:06:06.110
 Spanish sometimes will expose 

00:06:03.520 --> 00:06:07.590
 white skeletons 

00:06:06.110 --> 00:06:10.660
 Y 

00:06:07.590 --> 00:06:13.450
 well the idea here would be like 

00:06:10.660 --> 00:06:16.990
 build an experience farm 

00:06:13.450 --> 00:06:19.450
 with this to be able to achieve the 

00:06:16.990 --> 00:06:22.420
 widget more easily in the heads 

00:06:19.450 --> 00:06:25.280
 because it is very very difficult as you see here 

00:06:22.420 --> 00:06:30.160
 exposes a white 

00:06:25.280 --> 00:06:30.160
 so good that 's all for today 

00:06:30.270 --> 00:06:37.150
 efe the river is super strong so no 

00:06:34.980 --> 00:06:41.360
 I like the sea more 

00:06:37.150 --> 00:06:43.810
 that's all for today chau chau chau chau 

00:06:41.360 --> 00:06:43.810
 bye
