 competing at the time like that 

00:00:12.780 --> 00:00:20.160
 first French fish ramps

 say ext poems since they have a 

00:00:20.160 --> 00:00:25.560
 little review their judgment here or there already 

00:00:23.430 --> 00:00:27.630

00:00:25.560 --> 00:00:29.189

 think beasts mode of preparation 

00:00:30.869 --> 00:00:35.540
 with regional variations 

00:00:32.610 --> 00:00:39.680
 we have two books in yvorne white bus 

00:00:35.540 --> 00:00:39.680

 is important more serious the leaders 

00:00:53.640 --> 00:00:57.239
 from each team those who will lead the 

00:00:55.469 --> 00:01:00.000
 trap for the marathon recognizes this the 

00:00:57.239 --> 00:01:04.559
 course a single number 4 g first 

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:06.450
 league at war you feel the principle 

00:01:04.559 --> 00:01:08.369
 letters attached to poles he 

00:01:06.450 --> 00:01:09.060
 must follow in an imperative order 

00:01:08.369 --> 00:01:11.880
 alphabetical 

00:01:09.060 --> 00:01:13.350
 he's looking for physical memory when 

00:01:11.880 --> 00:01:15.780
 we'll be with horses 

00:01:13.350 --> 00:01:17.970
 well it must be really a 

00:01:15.780 --> 00:01:20.790
 automatism wants to know when I'm coming out of 

00:01:17.970 --> 00:01:24.119
 the bay I absolutely do not have to make you 

00:01:20.790 --> 00:01:25.710
 a left flip and avoid like the 

00:01:24.119 --> 00:01:27.689
 little parterre or such pole with a 

00:01:25.710 --> 00:01:29.369
 flag there I will not have time anymore 

00:01:27.689 --> 00:01:32.400
 to really look after anyone 

00:01:29.369 --> 00:01:34.259
 what first team expected at the start 

00:01:32.400 --> 00:01:36.210
 of the marathon the Belgians of the trait of the 

00:01:34.259 --> 00:01:37.829
 famine with Swiss horses 

00:01:36.210 --> 00:01:39.360
 small free mountains the real 

00:01:37.829 --> 00:01:41.070
 pressure there is for dominique the 

00:01:39.360 --> 00:01:44.369
 leader it's coming 

00:01:41.070 --> 00:01:46.799
 nicely but I like the pressure I 

00:01:44.369 --> 00:01:48.720
 came to win and for my team 

00:01:46.799 --> 00:01:49.520
 I want to win so there precise where I have to 

00:01:48.720 --> 00:01:53.210
 give me back 

00:01:49.520 --> 00:01:53.210
 it's good it's my pleasure 

00:01:55.600 --> 00:01:59.259
 before you start, you have to heat the 

00:01:57.580 --> 00:02:00.850
 hair you my bosses check 

00:01:59.259 --> 00:02:01.930
 the mood of one or the other and 

00:02:00.850 --> 00:02:04.360
 possibly operated a few 

00:02:01.930 --> 00:02:06.820
 corrections reproach of Tuesday did 

00:02:04.360 --> 00:02:09.429
 released two married were dirty hands 

00:02:06.820 --> 00:02:11.470
 who will take the carriage a single 

00:02:09.429 --> 00:02:13.660
 coupling with two horses ears on 

00:02:11.470 --> 00:02:15.430
 leader is behind the group on 

00:02:13.660 --> 00:02:16.720
 also called the element monkey 

00:02:15.430 --> 00:02:18.220
 essential it is he who will help 

00:02:16.720 --> 00:02:21.580
 the hitch turned into gear and 

00:02:18.220 --> 00:02:24.819
 the urgency together they then revise the 

00:02:21.580 --> 00:02:28.989
 second we go back to the right we turn 

00:02:24.819 --> 00:02:31.400
 on the left, we enter the left trap and 

00:02:28.989 --> 00:02:35.299
 this time it's gone 

00:02:31.400 --> 00:02:37.780
 and did not have them at a big josiane 

00:02:35.299 --> 00:02:43.900
 beaud the butter is not normal without 

00:02:37.780 --> 00:02:46.909
 doubt I knew the baule is down merten 

00:02:43.900 --> 00:02:48.739
 a ball is a penalty deposited on 

00:02:46.909 --> 00:02:50.720
 a cone in the turns she falls 

00:02:48.739 --> 00:02:52.640
 when he is caught too tight comes 

00:02:50.720 --> 00:02:54.079

00:02:52.640 --> 00:02:56.150
 second place is for the Picard team 

00:02:54.079 --> 00:02:57.019

00:02:56.150 --> 00:02:58.370
 frank mountains 

00:02:57.019 --> 00:03:02.560

00:02:58.370 --> 00:03:02.560
