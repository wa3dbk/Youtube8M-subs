 it's all the same good old diesel 

00:01:23.649 --> 00:01:28.600

00:01:25.290 --> 00:01:31.360
 as you see the new rims they 

00:01:28.600 --> 00:01:33.850

00:01:31.360 --> 00:01:37.479
 reinforced construction behind us 

00:01:33.850 --> 00:01:40.660

00:01:37.479 --> 00:01:43.130
 turn signals form remained the same but 

00:01:40.660 --> 00:01:46.100
 looks completely different 

00:01:43.130 --> 00:01:49.620
 of course a lot of chromium was added 

00:01:46.100 --> 00:01:52.290
 rum everywhere just all these black 

00:01:49.620 --> 00:01:52.860
 Chrome steel inserts look

 hands and keyless entry 

00:02:02.840 --> 00:02:09.300
 for example, we can open this door 

00:02:05.280 --> 00:02:14.400
 keychain something to throw in a quick 

00:02:09.300 --> 00:02:16.680
 times still without a keychain we can 

00:02:14.400 --> 00:02:17.700
 just go open the back door 

00:02:16.680 --> 00:02:29.489
 pressing the button 

00:02:17.700 --> 00:02:30.420

00:02:30.420 --> 00:02:36.110
 opens manually or mechanically 

00:02:33.030 --> 00:02:40.280
 the electric drive here just can't handle it 

00:02:36.110 --> 00:02:42.810
 huge luggage compartment with a mass 

00:02:40.280 --> 00:02:45.020

 Here these inserts under the tree resemble 

00:04:59.080 --> 00:05:02.980
 natural wood or even I got confused 

00:05:01.420 --> 00:05:06.970

00:05:02.980 --> 00:05:11.470
