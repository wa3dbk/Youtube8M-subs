pan done right away you kind of want to

00:02:46.870 --> 00:02:48.990 
pan done right away you kind of want to
rotate<00:02:47.019> it<00:02:47.319> around<00:02:47.410> so<00:02:47.829> it<00:02:47.950> covers<00:02:48.160> all<00:02:48.519> edges

00:02:48.990 --> 00:02:49.000 
rotate it around so it covers all edges

00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:52.319 
rotate it around so it covers all edges
sure<00:02:49.269> so<00:02:49.569> crepes<00:02:50.019> are<00:02:50.140> very<00:02:50.440> thin<00:02:50.739> yes<00:02:51.160> so<00:02:52.150> like
