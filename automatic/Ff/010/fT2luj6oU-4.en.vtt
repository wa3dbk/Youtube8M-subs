because<00:01:16.979> i<00:01:17.040> feel<00:01:17.220> like<00:01:17.250> it<00:01:17.490> is<00:01:17.670> so<00:01:17.970> classic<00:01:18.299> but

00:01:18.679 --> 00:01:18.689 
because i feel like it is so classic but

00:01:18.689 --> 00:01:20.149 
because i feel like it is so classic but
what<00:01:18.840> makes<00:01:19.020> sense<00:01:19.290> for<00:01:19.409> apple<00:01:19.650> have<00:01:19.830> only<00:01:20.009> an

00:01:20.149 --> 00:01:20.159 
what makes sense for apple have only an

00:01:20.159 --> 00:01:21.560 
what makes sense for apple have only an
ipod<00:01:20.430> touch<00:01:20.580> in<00:01:20.700> the<00:01:20.790> ipod<00:01:21.060> nano<00:01:21.270> because

00:01:21.560 --> 00:01:21.570 
ipod touch in the ipod nano because

00:01:21.570 --> 00:01:22.850 
ipod touch in the ipod nano because
they're<00:01:21.720> both<00:01:21.869> the<00:01:21.960> touch<00:01:22.110> base<00:01:22.380> i<00:01:22.650> think

00:01:22.850 --> 00:01:22.860 
they're both the touch base i think

00:01:22.860 --> 00:01:24.170 
they're both the touch base i think
would<00:01:23.040> also<00:01:23.189> kind<00:01:23.430> of<00:01:23.490> simplify<00:01:23.880> things<00:01:23.939> a

00:01:24.170 --> 00:01:24.180 
would also kind of simplify things a

00:01:24.180 --> 00:01:26.090 
would also kind of simplify things a
little<00:01:24.330> bit<00:01:24.479> so<00:01:24.810> i'd<00:01:25.140> be<00:01:25.290> sad<00:01:25.500> to<00:01:25.710> see<00:01:25.830> the<00:01:25.950> to

00:01:26.090 --> 00:01:26.100 
little bit so i'd be sad to see the to

00:01:26.100 --> 00:01:27.620 
little bit so i'd be sad to see the to
go<00:01:26.310> but<00:01:26.580> if<00:01:26.670> it<00:01:26.759> happens<00:01:26.850> I<00:01:27.210> won't<00:01:27.330> be<00:01:27.509> upset

00:01:27.620 --> 00:01:27.630 
go but if it happens I won't be upset

00:01:27.630 --> 00:01:29.270 
go but if it happens I won't be upset

years that I think Apple might finally
