this and coolants quick disconnects on
the<00:02:15.150> side<00:02:15.390> here<00:02:15.750> so<00:02:16.709> that<00:02:16.890> you<00:02:17.040> can<00:02:17.810> disconnect

00:02:18.800 --> 00:02:18.810

the<00:02:19.110> waterboxx<00:02:19.680> easily<00:02:20.220> just<00:02:21.209> some<00:02:21.390> 90

00:02:21.710 --> 00:02:21.720 
the waterboxx easily just some 90

00:02:21.720 --> 00:02:24.380 
the waterboxx easily just some 90
degrees<00:02:22.049> there<00:02:22.549> so<00:02:23.549> that<00:02:23.579> I<00:02:23.790> could<00:02:23.850> push<00:02:24.150> it<00:02:24.180> up

00:02:24.380 --> 00:02:24.390 
degrees there so that I could push it up

00:02:24.390 --> 00:02:26.870 
degrees there so that I could push it up
against<00:02:24.630> the<00:02:24.810> wall<00:02:25.220> yeah<00:02:26.220> there's<00:02:26.430> one<00:02:26.459> fan

00:02:26.870 --> 00:02:26.880 
against the wall yeah there's one fan

00:02:26.880 --> 00:02:30.199 
against the wall yeah there's one fan
that's<00:02:27.030> not<00:02:27.239> working<00:02:27.480> I<00:02:27.840> think<00:02:28.790> it<00:02:29.790> must<00:02:30.000> have

00:02:30.199 --> 00:02:30.209 
that's not working I think it must have

00:02:30.209 --> 00:02:31.400 
that's not working I think it must have
come<00:02:30.360> unplugged<00:02:30.660> when<00:02:30.959> I<00:02:31.019> was<00:02:31.140> doing<00:02:31.260> the

00:02:31.400 --> 00:02:31.410 
come unplugged when I was doing the

00:02:31.410 --> 00:02:35.330 
come unplugged when I was doing the
cable<00:02:31.829> management<00:02:33.500> all<00:02:34.500> the<00:02:34.709> other<00:02:34.860> fans<00:02:35.130> are

00:02:35.330 --> 00:02:35.340 
cable management all the other fans are

00:02:35.340 --> 00:02:37.310 
cable management all the other fans are
going<00:02:35.459> at<00:02:35.640> full<00:02:35.850> RPM<00:02:36.360> so<00:02:36.690> I<00:02:36.780> doubt<00:02:36.989> it's<00:02:37.200> a

00:02:37.310 --> 00:02:37.320 
going at full RPM so I doubt it's a

00:02:37.320 --> 00:02:39.620 
going at full RPM so I doubt it's a
power<00:02:37.560> problem<00:02:38.030> i'll<00:02:39.030> just<00:02:39.209> give<00:02:39.450> you<00:02:39.480> a

00:02:39.620 --> 00:02:39.630 
power problem i'll just give you a

00:02:39.630 --> 00:02:44.610 
power problem i'll just give you a
better<00:02:39.810> look<00:02:40.079> at<00:02:40.230> the<00:02:40.850> tubing<00:02:41.850> design

00:02:44.610 --> 00:02:44.620 

00:02:44.620 --> 00:02:48.180 

so<00:02:45.069> you<00:02:45.970> can<00:02:46.180> see<00:02:46.450> that<00:02:46.690> she<00:02:47.409> goes<00:02:47.799> into<00:02:48.069> that

00:02:48.180 --> 00:02:48.190 
so you can see that she goes into that

00:02:48.190 --> 00:02:53.580 
so you can see that she goes into that
radiator<00:02:51.420> so<00:02:52.420> it<00:02:52.540> starts<00:02:52.750> the<00:02:53.080> reservoir

00:02:53.580 --> 00:02:53.590 
radiator so it starts the reservoir

00:02:53.590 --> 00:02:56.399 
radiator so it starts the reservoir
anyway<00:02:54.040> goes<00:02:54.370> through<00:02:54.640> the<00:02:54.700> pumps<00:02:55.180> both<00:02:56.110> pumps

00:02:56.399 --> 00:02:56.409 
anyway goes through the pumps both pumps

00:02:56.409 --> 00:03:01.020 
anyway goes through the pumps both pumps
and<00:02:57.090> then<00:02:58.090> up<00:02:58.629> to<00:02:58.900> the<00:02:58.930> seat<00:02:59.230> to<00:02:59.980> the<00:03:00.129> weather

00:03:01.020 --> 00:03:01.030 
and then up to the seat to the weather

00:03:01.030 --> 00:03:03.199 
and then up to the seat to the weather
it's<00:03:01.209> crawling<00:03:01.510> and<00:03:01.840> then<00:03:01.959> it<00:03:02.049> comes<00:03:02.200> back<00:03:02.349> in

00:03:03.199 --> 00:03:03.209 
it's crawling and then it comes back in

00:03:03.209 --> 00:03:07.619 
it's crawling and then it comes back in
to<00:03:04.209> the<00:03:04.239> radiator<00:03:04.690> out<00:03:05.760> there<00:03:06.760> into<00:03:07.269> the<00:03:07.360> next

00:03:07.619 --> 00:03:07.629 
to the radiator out there into the next

00:03:07.629 --> 00:03:10.589 
to the radiator out there into the next
one<00:03:08.069> out<00:03:09.069> of<00:03:09.250> that<00:03:09.370> one<00:03:09.549> into<00:03:09.940> the<00:03:10.120> next<00:03:10.420> one

00:03:10.589 --> 00:03:10.599 
one out of that one into the next one

00:03:10.599 --> 00:03:15.270 
one out of that one into the next one
and<00:03:10.980> then<00:03:11.980> up<00:03:12.250> into<00:03:12.489> the<00:03:12.670> reservoir<00:03:14.010> so<00:03:15.010> there

00:03:15.270 --> 00:03:15.280 
and then up into the reservoir so there

00:03:15.280 --> 00:03:20.130 
and then up into the reservoir so there
she<00:03:15.489> is<00:03:15.780> you're<00:03:16.780> beautiful<00:03:18.780> I'm<00:03:19.780> just<00:03:19.930> running

down seriously I'm kind of running for

00:03:27.459 --> 00:03:30.270 
down seriously I'm kind of running for
three<00:03:27.700> minutes<00:03:27.910> and<00:03:28.859> see<00:03:29.859> if<00:03:29.980> it's<00:03:30.129> been

00:03:30.270 --> 00:03:30.280 
three minutes and see if it's been

00:03:30.280 --> 00:03:32.130 
three minutes and see if it's been
filling<00:03:30.549> it<00:03:30.700> up<00:03:30.790> I've<00:03:31.329> got<00:03:31.540> filters<00:03:31.930> on<00:03:32.049> the

00:03:32.130 --> 00:03:32.140 
filling it up I've got filters on the

00:03:32.140 --> 00:03:36.839 
filling it up I've got filters on the
front<00:03:32.379> there<00:03:34.799> yeah<00:03:35.799> that's<00:03:36.040> a<00:03:36.159> swiftech

00:03:36.839 --> 00:03:36.849

will<00:03:42.129> be<00:03:42.250> cool<00:03:42.459> more<00:03:42.760> components<00:03:43.359> with<00:03:43.510> this

00:03:43.649 --> 00:03:43.659 
will be cool more components with this

00:03:43.659 --> 00:03:46.710 
will be cool more components with this
water<00:03:43.870> cooling<00:03:44.200> system<00:03:44.590> eventually<00:03:45.540> but<00:03:46.540> this

00:03:46.710 --> 00:03:46.720 
water cooling system eventually but this

00:03:46.720 --> 00:03:49.080 
water cooling system eventually but this
is<00:03:46.900> a<00:03:46.930> review<00:03:47.200> test<00:03:47.590> bed<00:03:47.799> so<00:03:48.159> I'm<00:03:48.400> swapping<00:03:48.790> and

00:03:49.080 --> 00:03:49.090 
is a review test bed so I'm swapping and

00:03:49.090 --> 00:03:53.479 
is a review test bed so I'm swapping and
changing<00:03:49.480> all<00:03:49.690> the<00:03:49.720> time<00:03:51.540> so<00:03:52.540> speed<00:03:53.079> for

00:03:53.479 --> 00:03:53.489 
changing all the time so speed for

00:03:53.489 --> 00:03:56.970 
changing all the time so speed for
testing<00:03:54.489> only<00:03:55.440> so<00:03:56.440> I'll<00:03:56.560> just<00:03:56.590> give<00:03:56.829> you<00:03:56.859> a

00:03:56.970 --> 00:03:56.980 
testing only so I'll just give you a

00:03:56.980 --> 00:03:59.580 
testing only so I'll just give you a
look<00:03:57.130> at<00:03:57.280> links<00:03:57.639> and<00:03:57.790> the<00:03:58.200> temperatures<00:03:59.200> that

00:03:59.580 --> 00:03:59.590 
look at links and the temperatures that

00:03:59.590 --> 00:04:04.949 
look at links and the temperatures that
I'm<00:03:59.709> getting<00:04:02.910> so<00:04:03.910> this<00:04:04.209> is<00:04:04.329> being<00:04:04.569> running

00:04:04.949 --> 00:04:04.959 
I'm getting so this is being running

00:04:04.959 --> 00:04:09.750 
I'm getting so this is being running
about<00:04:05.470> five<00:04:05.769> minutes<00:04:05.980> or<00:04:06.220> something<00:04:08.700> now<00:04:09.700> the

00:04:09.750 --> 00:04:09.760 
about five minutes or something now the

00:04:09.760 --> 00:04:13.050 
about five minutes or something now the
CPU<00:04:10.629> is<00:04:10.930> at<00:04:11.109> 4.6<00:04:11.799> gigahertz<00:04:12.220> I'll<00:04:12.669> just<00:04:12.790> show

00:04:13.050 --> 00:04:13.060 
CPU is at 4.6 gigahertz I'll just show

00:04:13.060 --> 00:04:20.759 
CPU is at 4.6 gigahertz I'll just show
you<00:04:13.090> that<00:04:15.329> 4.6<00:04:16.329> gigahertz

00:04:20.759 --> 00:04:20.769 

00:04:20.769 --> 00:04:26.550 

v<00:04:21.769> corps<00:04:22.099> is<00:04:22.430> at<00:04:22.669> one<00:04:22.879> point<00:04:23.090> three<00:04:23.949> bolts<00:04:25.000> and

00:04:26.550 --> 00:04:26.560 
v corps is at one point three bolts and

00:04:26.560 --> 00:04:34.749 
v corps is at one point three bolts and
the<00:04:27.560> CPU<00:04:28.780> is<00:04:30.729> not<00:04:31.729> passing<00:04:32.240> 70<00:04:33.159> it's<00:04:34.159> getting

00:04:34.749 --> 00:04:34.759 
the CPU is not passing 70 it's getting

00:04:34.759 --> 00:04:40.240 
the CPU is not passing 70 it's getting
up<00:04:34.879> to<00:04:35.030> about<00:04:36.039> 68<00:04:37.039> to<00:04:37.340> maximum<00:04:38.440> so<00:04:39.440> that's

00:04:40.240 --> 00:04:40.250 
up to about 68 to maximum so that's

00:04:40.250 --> 00:04:42.339 
up to about 68 to maximum so that's

pretty awesome with my hair color it was

00:04:42.349 --> 00:04:45.249 
pretty awesome with my hair color it was
getting<00:04:42.590> up<00:04:42.740> to<00:04:42.919> 85<00:04:43.610> degrees<00:04:43.639> at<00:04:44.629> 4.6
