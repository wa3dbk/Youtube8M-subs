00:00:18.460 --> 00:00:23.600
 when a man and a woman parents one day 

00:00:21.140 --> 00:00:25.640
 then you will not only need them in 

00:00:23.600 --> 00:00:27.760
 usually a larger apartment but 

00:00:25.640 --> 00:00:30.860
 usually a bigger car too 

00:00:27.760 --> 00:00:33.199
 this raises the question then buy 

00:00:30.860 --> 00:00:35.809
 Let's get a combo or buy ourselves 

00:00:33.199 --> 00:00:37.879
 a mini off-road vehicle, for example 

00:00:35.809 --> 00:00:41.239
 the car that stands behind me that is 

00:00:37.879 --> 00:00:53.000
 the new toyota rav4 which it now off 

00:00:41.239 --> 00:00:55.579
 april in the fourth generation gives it 

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:57.739
 car drives fine you are sitting very well 

00:00:55.579 --> 00:00:59.440
 the seats are well contoured one 

00:00:57.739 --> 00:01:02.090
 do not just slip around 

00:00:59.440 --> 00:01:03.320
 haphazard and aimless but they offer 

00:01:02.090 --> 00:01:06.140
 very good page stop 

00:01:03.320 --> 00:01:08.990
 the overview is to the right and left 

00:01:06.140 --> 00:01:12.799
 not even good at the back 

00:01:08.990 --> 00:01:15.140
 always so with these cars and the 

00:01:12.799 --> 00:01:17.960
 Operation is also very clear 

00:01:15.140 --> 00:01:19.880
 The dashboard is very fast 

00:01:17.960 --> 00:01:22.820
 understand there is even at all 

00:01:19.880 --> 00:01:25.430
 No mistake when talking about 

00:01:22.820 --> 00:01:25.820
 press a button for the navigation 

00:01:25.430 --> 00:01:28.240
 want 

00:01:25.820 --> 00:01:31.220
 everything works well with a small one 

00:01:28.240 --> 00:01:34.040
 exception below the dashboard 

00:01:31.220 --> 00:01:36.830
 are again five buttons the relative 

00:01:34.040 --> 00:01:38.540
 hard to see but one understands 

00:01:36.830 --> 00:01:42.430
 it probably relatively fast 

00:01:38.540 --> 00:01:42.430
 if you bought the car 

00:01:46.939 --> 00:01:53.640
 also the steering and the steering wheel are 

00:01:50.939 --> 00:01:56.009
 easy to handle the steering is direct so 

00:01:53.640 --> 00:01:56.909
 so that one feels the contact to the street 

00:01:56.009 --> 00:02:00.659
 very pleasant 

00:01:56.909 --> 00:02:03.569
 the standard six-speed transmission leaves 

00:02:00.659 --> 00:02:07.679
 are great in the top 

00:02:03.569 --> 00:02:11.420
 execution so with the 2.2 liter diesel 

00:02:07.679 --> 00:02:13.590
 with 150 ps and other knickknacks 

00:02:11.420 --> 00:02:15.989
 Leather seats and so on are also available 

00:02:13.590 --> 00:02:18.930
 a sports key that is quite interesting 

00:02:15.989 --> 00:02:21.780
 if you press that down here then 

00:02:18.930 --> 00:02:23.730
 the response of the 

00:02:21.780 --> 00:02:26.640
 motors is so then a piece 

00:02:23.730 --> 00:02:29.299
 more toxic and also the landing gear shifts 

00:02:26.640 --> 00:02:32.069
 quasi of comfort tougher 

00:02:29.299 --> 00:02:35.160
 and who is it a little faster and faster 

00:02:32.069 --> 00:02:38.450
 something sportier loves for that comes so 

00:02:35.160 --> 00:02:38.450
 which is certainly in question 

00:02:43.150 --> 00:02:48.319
 the design of the car became basic 

00:02:45.709 --> 00:02:50.300
 but revised in nuances so that it 

00:02:48.319 --> 00:02:51.590
 not overly strong it became noticeable 

00:02:50.300 --> 00:02:54.560
 sharpened at one or the other 

00:02:51.590 --> 00:02:56.900
 front and especially at the back 

00:02:54.560 --> 00:02:59.480
 you can see that on this very unload 

00:02:56.900 --> 00:03:03.220
 the rear lights already something tray 

00:02:59.480 --> 00:03:03.220
 come along 

00:03:08.440 --> 00:03:14.090
 interesting is a very essential 

00:03:10.940 --> 00:03:18.970
 the innovation of this car is that 

00:03:14.090 --> 00:03:22.190
 the tailgate I open it now 

00:03:18.970 --> 00:03:26.750
 the previous models all had one 

00:03:22.190 --> 00:03:28.459
 big hatchback that opened wide 

00:03:26.750 --> 00:03:30.379
 could then give problems with the 

00:03:28.459 --> 00:03:32.180
 Hintermann while long ago grab the door 

00:03:30.379 --> 00:03:34.010
 Did not go far enough you could 

00:03:32.180 --> 00:03:36.440
 Do not properly load or unload the car 

00:03:34.010 --> 00:03:38.629
 that it is different now and better with 

00:03:36.440 --> 00:03:41.480
 this new tailgate the up 

00:03:38.629 --> 00:03:42.860
 wide opens and so has toyota so 

00:03:41.480 --> 00:03:45.200
 also to the conditions of the market 

00:03:42.860 --> 00:03:47.930
 adapted to all competitors 

00:03:45.200 --> 00:03:51.650
 such a large tailgate also good 

00:03:47.930 --> 00:03:53.959
 it is also that this car one 

00:03:51.650 --> 00:03:56.690
 Hidden trunk has one here 

00:03:53.959 --> 00:03:58.430
 they do not accommodate things 

00:03:56.690 --> 00:04:02.200
 car then are visible and maybe 

00:03:58.430 --> 00:04:02.200
 I am also overly docking 

00:04:07.239 --> 00:04:10.160
 cheap kids are toyotas for a long time 

00:04:09.410 --> 00:04:13.130
 no more 

00:04:10.160 --> 00:04:18.049
 This car starts in the price list 

00:04:13.130 --> 00:04:21.910
 with 26,000 650 euro as entry-level version 

00:04:18.049 --> 00:04:26.060
 and the price list ends at least 

00:04:21.910 --> 00:04:28.330
 37,500 50 euro that is not enough 

00:04:26.060 --> 00:04:28.330
 you say 

00:04:34.470 --> 00:04:40.419
 as with humans, that's just the way it is 

00:04:37.120 --> 00:04:42.790
 in the cars either one likes the 

00:04:40.419 --> 00:04:45.250
 figure or you do not like one 

00:04:42.790 --> 00:04:48.160
 here it is interesting that toyota 

00:04:45.250 --> 00:04:50.320
 trying a piece of dynamics with these 

00:04:48.160 --> 00:04:50.950
 two little lines here in the car 

00:04:50.320 --> 00:04:54.010
 bring to 

00:04:50.950 --> 00:04:56.470
 I think that the car was successful 

00:04:54.010 --> 00:04:58.150
 It also gives you a tension 

00:04:56.470 --> 00:05:00.520
 that's what the designer is 

00:04:58.150 --> 00:05:03.010
 also want to reach 

00:05:00.520 --> 00:05:05.440
 that's a very comfortable car it 

00:05:03.010 --> 00:05:08.410
 drives very pleasant you are sitting very well 

00:05:05.440 --> 00:05:10.930
 and it is also very family friendly 

00:05:08.410 --> 00:05:13.240
 the main points for that are 

00:05:10.930 --> 00:05:15.940
 for example, one at the back 

00:05:13.240 --> 00:05:19.030
 Ordinary footwell has that one 

00:05:15.940 --> 00:05:22.300
 the big trunk has even gone through 

00:05:19.030 --> 00:05:23.650
 fold back the back also still 

00:05:22.300 --> 00:05:25.690
 can be increased 

00:05:23.650 --> 00:05:27.900
 Overall, the car is a coherent 

00:05:25.690 --> 00:05:27.900
 package
