00:00:05.620 --> 00:00:12.170
 in a poor neighborhood of a distant city 

00:00:08.269 --> 00:00:15.200
 lived a very pretty little girl she 

00:00:12.170 --> 00:00:16.820
 I went to the local school 

00:00:15.200 --> 00:00:19.060
 his mother was not very careful and 

00:00:16.820 --> 00:00:21.470
 child was almost always dirty 

00:00:19.060 --> 00:00:23.149
 his clothes were very old and 

00:00:21.470 --> 00:00:25.309
 battered 

00:00:23.149 --> 00:00:28.309
 the teacher was penalized with the 

00:00:25.309 --> 00:00:31.189
 the situation of the girl and thought how 

00:00:28.309 --> 00:00:33.550
 Such a beautiful girl can come to the 

00:00:31.189 --> 00:00:35.840
 school so poorly arranged 

00:00:33.550 --> 00:00:38.210
 so he separated a money from his 

00:00:35.840 --> 00:00:41.600
 salary although with difficulty 

00:00:38.210 --> 00:00:45.020
 She decided to buy him a new dress. 

00:00:41.600 --> 00:00:46.900
 You look beautiful in the blue dress when Mom 

00:00:45.020 --> 00:00:49.250
 saw the daughter in that beautiful blue dress 

00:00:46.900 --> 00:00:51.890
 felt that it was unfortunate that his 

00:00:49.250 --> 00:00:55.040
 daughter asking for that new costume was 

00:00:51.890 --> 00:00:57.140
 so dirty for school and so it passed 

00:00:55.040 --> 00:00:59.920
 to give him a bath every day combing 

00:00:57.140 --> 00:01:02.390
 hair cut your nails anyway 

00:00:59.920 --> 00:01:05.360
 When the week ended, the father spoke. 

00:01:02.390 --> 00:01:06.740
 woman, if I do not think it's a shame 

00:01:05.360 --> 00:01:10.009
 Our daughter being so beautiful and good. 

00:01:06.740 --> 00:01:11.990
 Tidy dwells in a place like this place. 

00:01:10.009 --> 00:01:14.780
 Falling apart 

00:01:11.990 --> 00:01:15.649
 How about you arrange the house in the hours 

00:01:14.780 --> 00:01:16.490
 vacancies 

00:01:15.649 --> 00:01:19.149
 I'm going to paint the walls. 

00:01:16.490 --> 00:01:22.340
 to fix the dry plant a garden 

00:01:19.149 --> 00:01:24.170
 soon the house stood out in the small 

00:01:22.340 --> 00:01:28.179
 the beauty of the flowers that filled the 

00:01:24.170 --> 00:01:30.109
 the garden care in every detail 

00:01:28.179 --> 00:01:32.209
 then the neighbors were ashamed 

00:01:30.109 --> 00:01:34.609
 for living in shacks made and 

00:01:32.209 --> 00:01:37.459
 they also decided to clean their houses 

00:01:34.609 --> 00:01:38.770
 plant the flowers an the painting an end in 

00:01:37.459 --> 00:01:41.799
 creativity 

00:01:38.770 --> 00:01:44.929
 in a short time the whole neighborhood was 

00:01:41.799 --> 00:01:47.029
 transformed into a man who accompanied 

00:01:44.929 --> 00:01:49.729
 the struggles and struggles of those people 

00:01:47.029 --> 00:01:50.829
 thought they deserved help 

00:01:49.729 --> 00:01:53.329
 of the authorities 

00:01:50.829 --> 00:01:54.799
 then the mayor explained his ideas and 

00:01:53.329 --> 00:01:56.060
 left with permission to train 

00:01:54.799 --> 00:01:57.770
 a committee to study the 

00:01:56.060 --> 00:02:01.219
 improvements that would be required 

00:01:57.770 --> 00:02:03.609
 neighborhood to mud and mud street was 

00:02:01.219 --> 00:02:05.749
 replaced by stone sidewalk 

00:02:03.609 --> 00:02:08.690
 the open sewers were 

00:02:05.749 --> 00:02:11.360
 channeled the neighborhood gained a 

00:02:08.690 --> 00:02:14.660
 citizenship and then 

00:02:11.360 --> 00:02:16.760
 time after seeing that neighborhood so 

00:02:14.660 --> 00:02:19.730
 beautiful so well taken care of 

00:02:16.760 --> 00:02:24.590
 who could have imagined that it all began 

00:02:19.730 --> 00:02:29.060
 with only one blue dress ecclesiastes 

00:02:24.590 --> 00:02:32.450
 chapter 11 verse first launches the 

00:02:29.060 --> 00:02:37.570
 your bread over the waters because after 

00:02:32.450 --> 00:02:37.570
 many days you'll find it
