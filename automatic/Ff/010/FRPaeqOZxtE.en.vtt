what's<00:02:42.630> clear<00:02:43.050> not<00:02:43.709> a<00:02:43.739> lot<00:02:43.980> of<00:02:44.130> room<00:02:44.310> for

00:02:44.330 --> 00:02:44.340 
what's clear not a lot of room for

00:02:44.340 --> 00:02:46.460 
what's clear not a lot of room for
intonation<00:02:44.940> but<00:02:45.269> I<00:02:45.360> noticed<00:02:46.050> there's<00:02:46.200> kind<00:02:46.410> of

00:02:46.460 --> 00:02:46.470 
intonation but I noticed there's kind of

00:02:46.470 --> 00:02:48.350 
intonation but I noticed there's kind of
an<00:02:46.590> arch<00:02:46.769> to<00:02:47.010> it<00:02:47.040> to<00:02:47.340> that<00:02:47.610> you<00:02:47.790> know<00:02:47.910> adjust<00:02:47.940> it

00:02:48.350 --> 00:02:48.360 
an arch to it to that you know adjust it

00:02:48.360 --> 00:02:51.080 
an arch to it to that you know adjust it
that<00:02:48.390> way<00:02:48.690> it's<00:02:49.080> what<00:02:49.230> I<00:02:49.590> found<00:02:50.250> like<00:02:50.550> closer

00:02:51.080 --> 00:02:51.090 
that way it's what I found like closer

00:02:51.090 --> 00:02:55.790
