00:01:17.440 --> 00:01:17.450 
lines and quite often you know the cash

00:01:17.450 --> 00:01:19.149 
lines and quite often you know the cash
to<00:01:17.720> do<00:01:17.840> it<00:01:17.960> because<00:01:18.229> the<00:01:18.350> bone<00:01:18.500> learn<00:01:18.770> it<00:01:19.009> as

00:01:19.149 --> 00:01:19.159 
to do it because the bone learn it as

00:01:19.159 --> 00:01:21.760

being<00:01:19.640> this<00:01:19.850> one<00:01:20.090> thing<00:01:20.509> this<00:01:20.960> grip<00:01:21.319> and<00:01:21.590> you

00:01:21.760 --> 00:01:21.770 
being this one thing this grip and you

00:01:21.770 --> 00:01:23.499 
being this one thing this grip and you
haven't<00:01:21.979> really<00:01:22.190> internalize<00:01:22.520> the<00:01:23.000> piece<00:01:23.210> all

00:01:23.499 --> 00:01:23.509 
haven't really internalize the piece all

00:01:23.509 --> 00:01:25.690 
haven't really internalize the piece all
of<00:01:23.659> the<00:01:23.750> fretboard<00:01:24.009> it's<00:01:25.009> really<00:01:25.310> important

00:01:25.690 --> 00:01:25.700 
of the fretboard it's really important

00:01:25.700 --> 00:01:27.130 
of the fretboard it's really important
to<00:01:25.729> do<00:01:25.970> that<00:01:26.119> because<00:01:26.270> if<00:01:26.869> you<00:01:26.960> learn<00:01:27.110> the

00:01:27.130 --> 00:01:27.140

00:01:27.140 --> 00:01:29.290 
to do that because if you learn the
murder<00:01:27.409> to<00:01:27.649> a<00:01:27.679> standard<00:01:28.190> it's<00:01:28.940> good<00:01:29.090> to<00:01:29.119> learn

00:01:37.690 --> 00:01:37.700 
know it's nice to do that because we can

00:01:37.700 --> 00:01:43.260 
know it's nice to do that because we can
do<00:01:38.630> things<00:01:38.869> like<00:01:38.959> add<00:01:39.289> six<00:01:39.649> and<00:01:40.399> then<00:01:40.700> add<00:01:40.940> cars

00:01:45.520 --> 00:01:45.530 
and then we can do the same thing here

00:01:45.530 --> 00:01:55.839 
and then we can do the same thing here
so<00:01:53.739> on<00:01:54.739> and<00:01:54.890> so<00:01:54.920> forth<00:01:55.069> it's<00:01:55.429> a<00:01:55.489> really<00:01:55.670> nice

00:01:55.839 --> 00:01:55.849
