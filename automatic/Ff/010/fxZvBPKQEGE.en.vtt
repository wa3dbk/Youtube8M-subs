00:01:43.380 --> 00:01:43.390 
think plus the second level of it that

00:01:43.390 --> 00:01:45.390 
think plus the second level of it that
was<00:01:43.540> probably<00:01:43.750> the<00:01:43.930> most<00:01:44.110> nonlinear<00:01:44.830> level<00:01:45.250> in

00:01:45.390 --> 00:01:45.400 
was probably the most nonlinear level in

00:01:45.400 --> 00:01:48.780 
was probably the most nonlinear level in
the<00:01:45.430> entire<00:01:45.850> game<00:01:46.350> ha<00:01:47.350> bleep<00:01:47.620> the<00:01:48.370> music<00:01:48.730> is

00:01:48.780 --> 00:01:48.790 
the entire game ha bleep the music is

00:01:48.790 --> 00:01:52.200 
the entire game ha bleep the music is
nostalgic<00:01:49.570> and<00:01:49.720> it's<00:01:50.620> just<00:01:50.890> awesome<00:01:51.640> making

00:01:52.200 --> 00:01:52.210 
nostalgic and it's just awesome making

00:01:52.210 --> 00:01:57.860 
nostalgic and it's just awesome making
it<00:01:52.330> number<00:01:52.780> seven

00:01:57.860 --> 00:01:57.870 

00:01:57.870 --> 00:02:00.990
