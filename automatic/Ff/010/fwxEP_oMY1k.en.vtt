00:00:02.100 --> 00:00:05.360
 the description of the video 

00:00:08.860 --> 00:00:13.170
 now we wait 5 seconds 

00:00:19.140 --> 00:00:23.840
 now we click where it says script 

00:00:21.449 --> 00:00:23.840

00:01:02.120 --> 00:01:07.570
 we give in download I'm going to cancel it 

00:01:04.309 --> 00:01:07.570
 because I already have it 

00:01:20.710 --> 00:01:24.700
 good after downloading them 

00:01:22.810 --> 00:01:28.350
 leave an excel file or open and 

00:01:24.700 --> 00:01:28.350
 we extract the files that carry 

00:01:33.230 --> 00:01:37.670
 let them a notebook with 

00:01:35.240 --> 00:01:39.320
 instructions and the other are the archives 

00:01:37.670 --> 00:01:41.770
 that we have to add out to san 

00:01:39.320 --> 00:01:41.770
 andreas 

00:01:47.659 --> 00:01:52.909
 the installation is very easy only 

00:01:49.939 --> 00:01:57.159
 copies the models tours folders that I read 

00:01:52.909 --> 00:01:57.159
 and paste it in the gta root folder 

00:01:58.170 --> 00:02:02.630
 it comes out to replace me because I already 

00:02:00.330 --> 00:02:02.630
 I have 

00:02:05.020 --> 00:02:09.420
 we open the fishing editor 15 

00:02:10.500 --> 00:02:15.930
 we are in the blue folder and we choose 

00:02:12.870 --> 00:02:18.180
 the file gta 3 img we give in the arrow 

00:02:15.930 --> 00:02:20.490
 that points down and we choose the 

00:02:18.180 --> 00:02:23.190
 folder that we extract and now the folder 

00:02:20.490 --> 00:02:25.650
 gta 3 img and we chose the file and what 

00:02:23.190 --> 00:02:28.070
 we keep that is all then the 

00:02:25.650 --> 00:02:28.070
 gameplay 

00:02:30.640 --> 00:02:35.260
 to change weapons just press the 

00:02:33.040 --> 00:02:37.350
 tad key plus the number 1 of the part of 

00:02:35.260 --> 00:02:37.350
 above 

00:02:38.590 --> 00:02:42.670
 Well I think also changes 

00:02:40.660 --> 00:02:44.240
 color but I think that that is a criterion 

00:02:42.670 --> 00:02:48.140
 what creates 

00:02:44.240 --> 00:02:50.420

00:02:48.140 --> 00:02:53.500

00:02:50.420 --> 00:02:53.500
