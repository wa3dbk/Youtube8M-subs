00:00:12.630 --> 00:00:18.040
 starts with these seven locomotives 

00:00:15.820 --> 00:00:21.609
 in a new dimension 

00:00:18.040 --> 00:00:24.550
 playing mfx plus is the magic word 

00:00:21.609 --> 00:00:25.210
 and it provides even more role model in the 

00:00:24.550 --> 00:00:27.730
 model 

00:00:25.210 --> 00:00:29.289
 the locs simulate their fuel 

00:00:27.730 --> 00:00:31.990
 stock and settle on the 

00:00:29.289 --> 00:00:32.619
 Central Station almost like real machines 

00:00:31.990 --> 00:00:35.590
 drive 

00:00:32.619 --> 00:00:37.839
 This is especially appealing for steam locomotives 

00:00:35.590 --> 00:00:39.129
 all models with the fx funny or 

00:00:37.839 --> 00:00:41.320
 Of course, also in the 

00:00:39.129 --> 00:00:42.610
 conventional mfx operation on the 

00:00:41.320 --> 00:00:44.920
 be used 

00:00:42.610 --> 00:00:47.019
 there they do not notice a difference at the 

00:00:44.920 --> 00:00:49.150
 cs 2 is there then the possibility in the 

00:00:47.019 --> 00:00:51.820
 to make different modes semi-professional 

00:00:49.150 --> 00:00:54.070
 professional and specialist from half professional 

00:00:51.820 --> 00:00:55.659
 then you drive with setting 

00:00:54.070 --> 00:00:57.790
 utility consumption that is there 

00:00:55.659 --> 00:00:59.680
 you have to look at it then already 

00:00:57.790 --> 00:01:01.960
 you drive how much coal in the tender like 

00:00:59.680 --> 00:01:03.220
 I still have a lot of diesel in the tank and then 

00:01:01.960 --> 00:01:05.120
 you have to watch that one there 

00:01:03.220 --> 00:01:07.790
 copes 

00:01:05.120 --> 00:01:09.470
 So who drives sporty or heavy 

00:01:07.790 --> 00:01:12.410
 moves moves more often the 

00:01:09.470 --> 00:01:14.150
 resources must complement each other in profi 

00:01:12.410 --> 00:01:16.070
 Mode is the replica of the 

00:01:14.150 --> 00:01:19.180
 driver's license such as an e-lok 

00:01:16.070 --> 00:01:22.940
 of course, especially interesting 

00:01:19.180 --> 00:01:24.110
 Main switch on a hill high otherwise 

00:01:22.940 --> 00:01:26.660
 nothing is valid 

00:01:24.110 --> 00:01:28.640
 then it can start the lay 

00:01:26.660 --> 00:01:31.300
 accelerates to the preselected 

00:01:28.640 --> 00:01:31.300
 speed 

00:01:35.880 --> 00:01:39.119
 that fits into the extra 

00:01:37.469 --> 00:01:40.229
 Information on the way or 

00:01:39.119 --> 00:01:41.729
 are stored 

00:01:40.229 --> 00:01:44.399
 the supplies are in the 

00:01:41.729 --> 00:01:45.829
 is in the foreground electromotive 

00:01:44.399 --> 00:01:47.520
 that the brake sand at the 

00:01:45.829 --> 00:01:49.740
 diesel locomotive additionally the 

00:01:47.520 --> 00:01:52.289
 fuel and the steam locomotives 

00:01:49.740 --> 00:01:54.149
 is the land water and coal in the 

00:01:52.289 --> 00:01:56.700
 Driving take the supplies 

00:01:54.149 --> 00:01:59.220
 continuously more or less ever 

00:01:56.700 --> 00:02:01.740
 after loading the locomotive that is 

00:01:59.220 --> 00:02:03.329
 The decoder also notes whether 

00:02:01.740 --> 00:02:05.579
 more or less cars are attached 

00:02:03.329 --> 00:02:07.979
 or whether the locomotive is uphill or uphill 

00:02:05.579 --> 00:02:09.569
 downhill drives when in line profile 

00:02:07.979 --> 00:02:11.190
 have in plant profile with many 

00:02:09.569 --> 00:02:12.780
 slopes and a lot of slopes if you 

00:02:11.190 --> 00:02:14.310
 then have more wagons behind it 

00:02:12.780 --> 00:02:15.810
 go the supplies then goes 

00:02:14.310 --> 00:02:17.370
 the steam locomotive for example the 

00:02:15.810 --> 00:02:18.480
 Water consumption is then much higher 

00:02:17.370 --> 00:02:20.880
 coal consumption is much higher 

00:02:18.480 --> 00:02:22.920
 and you have to get back to her faster 

00:02:20.880 --> 00:02:23.370
 railway depot to allocate resources 

00:02:22.920 --> 00:02:26.400
 stash 

00:02:23.370 --> 00:02:29.010
 that also affects our diesel loco 

00:02:26.400 --> 00:02:31.049
 new fuel supplies also needed 

00:02:29.010 --> 00:02:33.420
 when they are exhausted they stay 

00:02:31.049 --> 00:02:36.360
 lok not suddenly but stand 

00:02:33.420 --> 00:02:38.190
 sneaks in an emergency program then a 

00:02:36.360 --> 00:02:39.260
 accelerate is not anymore 

00:02:38.190 --> 00:02:42.630
 possible 

00:02:39.260 --> 00:02:44.430
 around the extra mfx plus features 

00:02:42.630 --> 00:02:45.959
 to be able to use this on the system 

00:02:44.430 --> 00:02:50.190
 you need to be able to use them 

00:02:45.959 --> 00:02:52.680
 the cs2 central station 2 and important 

00:02:50.190 --> 00:02:56.160
 it is that you have the new update on it 

00:02:52.680 --> 00:02:57.810
 play from 3.0.1 and you will find that 

00:02:56.160 --> 00:02:58.650
 us on the homepage for free 

00:02:57.810 --> 00:03:02.340
 download 

00:02:58.650 --> 00:03:04.680
 in the download area 1 ried contact the 

00:03:02.340 --> 00:03:07.889
 we need to interact with it 

00:03:04.680 --> 00:03:10.859
 88 feedback module when it comes to it 

00:03:07.889 --> 00:03:12.150
 the maximum playing fun in the specialist 

00:03:10.859 --> 00:03:14.730
 to live out the mode 

00:03:12.150 --> 00:03:17.100
 these are at the central station the 

00:03:14.730 --> 00:03:19.590
 contacts and use processes to create 

00:03:17.100 --> 00:03:21.440
 First, the function with coal 

00:03:19.590 --> 00:03:24.510
 called 

00:03:21.440 --> 00:03:27.090
 a second contact makes sure 

00:03:24.510 --> 00:03:29.970
 that the lok just below the beko lungs 

00:03:27.090 --> 00:03:34.220
 plant comes to a standstill is the 

00:03:29.970 --> 00:03:34.220
 drain coal is programmed 

00:03:41.819 --> 00:03:48.329
 now the 23 rolls in the game as one 

00:03:45.989 --> 00:03:51.719
 small magnet under the lok switches 

00:03:48.329 --> 00:03:55.519
 the red contact a pictogram shows us 

00:03:51.719 --> 00:03:55.519
 that we take up stocks 

00:03:58.939 --> 00:04:04.379
 the lok keeps according to wishes and we 

00:04:01.980 --> 00:04:13.319
 follow the recording of the display 

00:04:04.379 --> 00:04:14.519
 coal but a steam loco also needs 

00:04:13.319 --> 00:04:17.970
 still sand and water 

00:04:14.519 --> 00:04:20.940
 Consequently, the 23 is on the way 

00:04:17.970 --> 00:04:22.680
 to the facilities concerned magnet 

00:04:20.940 --> 00:04:24.360
 Articles are practical with 

00:04:22.680 --> 00:04:27.389
 an additional mobile station 

00:04:24.360 --> 00:04:30.830
 switched so becomes the functional process 

00:04:27.389 --> 00:04:30.830
 not interrupted at the lok 

00:04:36.020 --> 00:04:41.490
 almost like a real steam engine 

00:04:39.030 --> 00:04:43.349
 the control works forwards or backwards 

00:04:41.490 --> 00:04:45.360
 reverse drive and set 

00:04:43.349 --> 00:04:47.669
 it goes to the water 

00:04:45.360 --> 00:04:49.650
 here too a touch of the 

00:04:47.669 --> 00:04:51.150
 pictogram to the corresponding 

00:04:49.650 --> 00:04:54.720
 triggering process 

00:04:51.150 --> 00:04:57.210
 mÃ¤rklin opens with the fx plus world 

00:04:54.720 --> 00:05:00.810
 a completely new game dimension 

00:04:57.210 --> 00:05:02.789
 while the mode profi learns quickly 

00:05:00.810 --> 00:05:05.580
 it is necessary in the operating form 

00:05:02.789 --> 00:05:08.099
 especially some exercise specialist 

00:05:05.580 --> 00:05:11.669
 It's about controlling a steam locomotive 

00:05:08.099 --> 00:05:13.650
 but it's fun at huge 

00:05:11.669 --> 00:05:15.479
 Selected specialist dealers can 

00:05:13.650 --> 00:05:18.180
 interesting the fascinating 

00:05:15.479 --> 00:05:20.909
 show functions in peace 

00:05:18.180 --> 00:05:22.830
 and another good news in the 

00:05:20.909 --> 00:05:28.820
 The next years will be fascinating 

00:05:22.830 --> 00:05:28.820
 systematically expanded by mfx plus
