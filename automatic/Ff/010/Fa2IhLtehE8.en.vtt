00:03:47.069 --> 00:03:47.079 
Toyota 4runner well you pretty much just

00:03:47.079 --> 00:03:49.409 
Toyota 4runner well you pretty much just
trying<00:03:47.500> to<00:03:47.620> hang<00:03:47.799> on<00:03:48.010> you<00:03:48.819> don't<00:03:48.969> really<00:03:49.150> want

00:03:49.409 --> 00:03:49.419 
trying to hang on you don't really want

00:03:49.419 --> 00:03:52.110 
trying to hang on you don't really want
to<00:03:49.480> push<00:03:49.689> the<00:03:49.810> limits<00:03:50.109> too<00:03:50.319> much<00:03:51.120> handles

00:03:52.110 --> 00:03:52.120 
to push the limits too much handles

00:03:52.120 --> 00:03:53.809 
to push the limits too much handles
pretty<00:03:52.359> well<00:03:52.540> for<00:03:52.750> a<00:03:52.840> vehicle<00:03:52.989> of<00:03:53.290> its<00:03:53.439> size

00:03:53.809 --> 00:03:53.819 
pretty well for a vehicle of its size

00:03:53.819 --> 00:03:59.089 
pretty well for a vehicle of its size
but<00:03:55.019> it's<00:03:56.019> certainly<00:03:56.439> no<00:03:56.849> track<00:03:57.849> star<00:03:58.209> and

00:03:59.089 --> 00:03:59.099 
but it's certainly no track star and

00:03:59.099 --> 00:04:04.409 
but it's certainly no track star and
it's<00:04:00.099> certainly<00:04:00.489> no<00:04:00.699> sports<00:04:01.060> car<00:04:01.560> so<00:04:03.269> the<00:04:04.269> most

00:04:04.409 --> 00:04:04.419 
it's certainly no sports car so the most

00:04:04.419 --> 00:04:06.119 
it's certainly no sports car so the most
fun<00:04:04.659> you<00:04:04.780> can<00:04:04.900> have<00:04:04.930> with<00:04:05.230> this<00:04:05.439> is<00:04:05.769> probably

00:04:06.119 --> 00:04:06.129 
fun you can have with this is probably

00:04:06.129 --> 00:04:11.440 
fun you can have with this is probably
off-road

00:04:11.440 --> 00:04:11.450 

00:04:11.450 --> 00:04:13.960 

so<00:04:12.110> to<00:04:12.170> sum<00:04:12.410> up<00:04:12.440> the<00:04:12.620> forerunner<00:04:13.069> basically

00:04:13.960 --> 00:04:13.970 
so to sum up the forerunner basically

00:04:13.970 --> 00:04:15.970 
so to sum up the forerunner basically
you're<00:04:14.390> getting<00:04:14.480> a<00:04:14.690> very<00:04:14.959> competent<00:04:15.349> grocery
