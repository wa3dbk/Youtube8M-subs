get Birds Dale's from the hatchery and

00:00:28.050 --> 00:00:29.689 
get Birds Dale's from the hatchery and
when<00:00:28.529> they're<00:00:28.680> in<00:00:28.770> the<00:00:28.860> brooder<00:00:29.070> barns<00:00:29.490> when

when they're in the brooder barns when
they're<00:00:29.820> babies<00:00:30.000> it's<00:00:30.510> important<00:00:31.050> to<00:00:31.140> get

they're babies it's important to get

00:00:31.260 --> 00:00:32.990 
they're babies it's important to get
those<00:00:31.440> birds<00:00:31.619> off<00:00:31.859> to<00:00:32.009> a<00:00:32.039> good<00:00:32.220> start<00:00:32.279> the

those birds off to a good start the
first<00:00:33.239> seven<00:00:33.600> days<00:00:33.630> is<00:00:33.989> very<00:00:34.170> critical<00:00:34.470> on<00:00:34.920> how

00:00:35.810 --> 00:00:35.820 
first seven days is very critical on how

00:00:35.820 --> 00:00:38.600 
first seven days is very critical on how
your<00:00:36.120> flock<00:00:36.570> is<00:00:36.780> going<00:00:36.930> to<00:00:36.989> perform<00:00:37.610> the

things that we concentrate on where
we're<00:00:40.050> raising<00:00:40.200> a<00:00:40.440> turkey<00:00:40.829> is<00:00:41.120> minimizing<00:00:42.120> the

00:00:42.350 --> 00:00:42.360 
we're raising a turkey is minimizing the

00:00:42.360 --> 00:00:44.990 
we're raising a turkey is minimizing the

00:00:57.020 --> 00:00:57.030 
grow our birds are down fresh litter

00:00:57.030 --> 00:00:59.299 
grow our birds are down fresh litter
they<00:00:57.690> roam<00:00:58.170> around<00:00:58.379> just<00:00:58.800> like<00:00:58.950> they<00:00:59.100> would<00:00:59.280> on

00:00:59.299 --> 00:00:59.309 
they roam around just like they would on

00:00:59.309 --> 00:01:01.340 
they roam around just like they would on
the<00:00:59.520> range<00:00:59.760> but<00:01:00.210> they're<00:01:00.390> inside<00:01:00.960> of<00:01:01.079> a<00:01:01.170> house

00:01:01.340 --> 00:01:01.350 
the range but they're inside of a house

00:01:01.350 --> 00:01:03.250 
the range but they're inside of a house
and<00:01:02.010> when<00:01:02.129> they're<00:01:02.250> exposed<00:01:02.640> to<00:01:02.820> the<00:01:02.879> elements

00:01:03.250 --> 00:01:03.260 
and when they're exposed to the elements

00:01:03.260 --> 00:01:06.950 
and when they're exposed to the elements
they<00:01:04.260> they<00:01:04.799> can<00:01:05.010> get<00:01:05.460> a<00:01:05.489> disease<00:01:05.880> and<00:01:06.240> if

00:01:06.950 --> 00:01:06.960 
they they can get a disease and if

00:01:06.960 --> 00:01:08.359 
they they can get a disease and if
they're<00:01:07.140> out<00:01:07.260> in<00:01:07.350> the<00:01:07.440> rain<00:01:07.619> the<00:01:07.890> bad<00:01:08.070> weather

00:01:08.359 --> 00:01:08.369 
they're out in the rain the bad weather

00:01:08.369 --> 00:01:10.430 
they're out in the rain the bad weather
so<00:01:08.940> on<00:01:09.060> and<00:01:09.150> so<00:01:09.240> forth<00:01:09.510> it's<00:01:09.720> it's<00:01:09.990> not<00:01:10.229> as

00:01:10.430 --> 00:01:10.440 
so on and so forth it's it's not as

00:01:10.440 --> 00:01:12.380 
so on and so forth it's it's not as
healthy<00:01:10.799> as<00:01:11.040> an<00:01:11.220> environment<00:01:11.670> as<00:01:11.909> our<00:01:12.090> birds

00:01:12.380 --> 00:01:12.390 
healthy as an environment as our birds

00:01:12.390 --> 00:01:26.990 
healthy as an environment as our birds
that<00:01:12.570> are<00:01:12.630> totally<00:01:13.080> closed

00:01:26.990 --> 00:01:27.000 

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:28.730 

with<00:01:27.540> the<00:01:27.660> way<00:01:27.750> the<00:01:27.900> economy<00:01:28.320> is<00:01:28.350> we're<00:01:28.560> always

00:01:28.730 --> 00:01:28.740 
with the way the economy is we're always

00:01:28.740 --> 00:01:30.920 
with the way the economy is we're always
looking<00:01:29.040> at<00:01:29.430> ways<00:01:29.670> to<00:01:29.700> improve<00:01:30.030> on<00:01:30.660> our

00:01:30.920 --> 00:01:30.930 
looking at ways to improve on our

00:01:30.930 --> 00:01:34.700 
looking at ways to improve on our
efficiency<00:01:32.150> so<00:01:33.150> this<00:01:33.330> year<00:01:33.630> is<00:01:33.780> our<00:01:33.960> is<00:01:34.230> our

00:01:34.700 --> 00:01:34.710 
efficiency so this year is our is our

00:01:34.710 --> 00:01:36.560 
efficiency so this year is our is our
array<00:01:35.160> of<00:01:35.280> solar<00:01:35.490> panels<00:01:35.880> which<00:01:36.120> we<00:01:36.300> leased

00:01:36.560 --> 00:01:36.570 
array of solar panels which we leased

00:01:36.570 --> 00:01:39.020 
array of solar panels which we leased
out<00:01:36.810> to<00:01:36.860> a<00:01:37.860> company<00:01:38.250> that<00:01:38.280> produces<00:01:38.580> about<00:01:38.970> one

00:01:39.020 --> 00:01:39.030 
out to a company that produces about one

00:01:39.030 --> 00:01:43.220 
out to a company that produces about one
megawatt<00:01:39.660> of<00:01:39.690> power<00:01:39.840> and<00:01:41.600> this<00:01:42.600> is<00:01:42.780> our<00:01:42.900> buffer

00:01:43.220 --> 00:01:43.230 
megawatt of power and this is our buffer

00:01:43.230 --> 00:01:45.770 
megawatt of power and this is our buffer
between<00:01:43.560> our<00:01:44.190> poultry<00:01:44.700> operation<00:01:45.270> and<00:01:45.510> the

00:01:45.770 --> 00:01:45.780 
between our poultry operation and the

00:01:45.780 --> 00:01:47.990 
between our poultry operation and the
surrounding<00:01:46.140> community<00:01:46.590> so<00:01:47.430> it's<00:01:47.580> a<00:01:47.640> perfect

00:01:47.990 --> 00:01:48.000 
surrounding community so it's a perfect

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:51.500 
surrounding community so it's a perfect
utilization<00:01:48.630> of<00:01:49.040> what<00:01:50.040> was<00:01:50.280> just<00:01:50.640> a<00:01:50.850> wasted

00:01:51.500 --> 00:01:51.510 
utilization of what was just a wasted

00:01:51.510 --> 00:01:52.790 
utilization of what was just a wasted
piece<00:01:51.660> of<00:01:51.810> property<00:01:52.080> before<00:01:52.320> that<00:01:52.620> we<00:01:52.680> could

00:01:52.790 --> 00:01:52.800 
piece of property before that we could

00:01:52.800 --> 00:02:01.670 
piece of property before that we could
do<00:01:52.920> nothing<00:01:53.070> with<00:01:53.280> a<00:01:59.869> dry<00:02:00.869> heat<00:02:01.140> out<00:02:01.410> here<00:02:01.619> in

00:02:01.670 --> 00:02:01.680 
do nothing with a dry heat out here in

00:02:01.680 --> 00:02:03.500 
do nothing with a dry heat out here in
the<00:02:01.770> summertime<00:02:02.070> we<00:02:02.729> get<00:02:02.850> up<00:02:03.000> in<00:02:03.119> the<00:02:03.210> triple

00:02:03.500 --> 00:02:03.510 
the summertime we get up in the triple

00:02:03.510 --> 00:02:05.840 
the summertime we get up in the triple
digits<00:02:03.869> so<00:02:04.800> this<00:02:04.979> is<00:02:05.130> a<00:02:05.160> tunnel<00:02:05.520> ventilation

00:02:05.840 --> 00:02:05.850 
digits so this is a tunnel ventilation

00:02:05.850 --> 00:02:07.670 
digits so this is a tunnel ventilation
type<00:02:06.150> of<00:02:06.300> system<00:02:06.660> we're<00:02:06.900> fully<00:02:07.170> enclosed

00:02:07.670 --> 00:02:07.680 
type of system we're fully enclosed

00:02:07.680 --> 00:02:11.090 
type of system we're fully enclosed
meaning<00:02:08.369> our<00:02:08.580> sidewalls<00:02:09.270> are<00:02:09.690> 100%<00:02:10.260> insulated

00:02:11.090 --> 00:02:11.100 
meaning our sidewalls are 100% insulated

00:02:11.100 --> 00:02:14.120 
meaning our sidewalls are 100% insulated
and<00:02:11.310> we're<00:02:11.520> able<00:02:11.670> to<00:02:12.200> were<00:02:13.200> able<00:02:13.410> to<00:02:13.560> monitor

00:02:14.120 --> 00:02:14.130 
and we're able to were able to monitor

00:02:14.130 --> 00:02:15.740 
and we're able to were able to monitor
our<00:02:14.400> temperature<00:02:14.970> and<00:02:15.120> humidity<00:02:15.540> conditions

00:02:15.740 --> 00:02:15.750 
our temperature and humidity conditions

00:02:15.750 --> 00:02:17.510 
our temperature and humidity conditions
a<00:02:16.080> lot<00:02:16.410> easier<00:02:16.890> this<00:02:17.100> way

00:02:17.510 --> 00:02:17.520 
a lot easier this way

00:02:17.520 --> 00:02:20.600 
a lot easier this way
so<00:02:17.910> as<00:02:18.060> you<00:02:18.180> can<00:02:18.300> see<00:02:18.360> we<00:02:18.840> have<00:02:19.080> fans<00:02:19.860> exhaust

00:02:20.600 --> 00:02:20.610 
so as you can see we have fans exhaust
