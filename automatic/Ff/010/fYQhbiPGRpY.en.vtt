US<00:05:22.640> history<00:05:23.150> which<00:05:23.450> I<00:05:23.600> heard<00:05:23.840> is<00:05:24.020> the<00:05:24.169> hardest

00:05:24.610 --> 00:05:24.620 
US history which I heard is the hardest

00:05:24.620 --> 00:05:26.770 
US history which I heard is the hardest
class<00:05:24.860> of<00:05:25.070> your<00:05:25.250> entire<00:05:25.550> life<00:05:26.030> and<00:05:26.330> I'm

00:05:26.770 --> 00:05:26.780 
class of your entire life and I'm

00:05:26.780 --> 00:05:29.050 
class of your entire life and I'm
worried<00:05:27.320> that<00:05:27.650> it's<00:05:27.800> going<00:05:27.980> to<00:05:28.130> put<00:05:28.340> my<00:05:28.460> 4.0

00:05:29.050 --> 00:05:29.060 
worried that it's going to put my 4.0

00:05:29.060 --> 00:05:32.140 
worried that it's going to put my 4.0
grade<00:05:29.510> point<00:05:29.540> average<00:05:30.080> in<00:05:30.320> jeopardy<00:05:30.740> um<00:05:31.150> so

00:05:32.140 --> 00:05:32.150 
grade point average in jeopardy um so

00:05:32.150 --> 00:05:34.570 
grade point average in jeopardy um so
yeah<00:05:32.360> that<00:05:32.630> alone<00:05:32.960> is<00:05:33.020> enough<00:05:33.260> to<00:05:33.530> like<00:05:34.310> make

00:05:34.570 --> 00:05:34.580 
yeah that alone is enough to like make

00:05:34.580 --> 00:05:35.910 
yeah that alone is enough to like make
me<00:05:34.730> want<00:05:34.880> to<00:05:34.970> run<00:05:35.060> away<00:05:35.120> from<00:05:35.300> junior

00:05:35.910 --> 00:05:35.920 
me want to run away from junior

00:05:35.920 --> 00:05:39.120 
me want to run away from junior
honor<00:05:36.130> she<00:05:36.370> was<00:05:36.490> history<00:05:37.290> and<00:05:38.290> then<00:05:38.800> spanish

00:05:39.120 --> 00:05:39.130 
honor she was history and then spanish

00:05:39.130 --> 00:05:40.410 
honor she was history and then spanish
three<00:05:39.490> which<00:05:39.670> we're<00:05:39.820> not<00:05:39.850> that<00:05:40.120> worried<00:05:40.360> about

00:05:40.410 --> 00:05:40.420 
three which we're not that worried about

00:05:40.420 --> 00:05:42.420 
three which we're not that worried about
cuz<00:05:40.660> i<00:05:40.720> like<00:05:40.840> spanish<00:05:41.230> and<00:05:41.590> then<00:05:42.040> honors

cuz i like spanish and then honors

00:05:42.430 --> 00:05:46.230 
cuz i like spanish and then honors
english<00:05:42.610> 11<00:05:43.240> um<00:05:43.950> just<00:05:44.950> english<00:05:45.550> and<00:05:45.880> then

00:05:46.230 --> 00:05:46.240 
english 11 um just english and then

00:05:46.240 --> 00:05:48.600 
english 11 um just english and then
chemistry<00:05:47.110> which<00:05:47.770> i've<00:05:48.040> heard<00:05:48.190> is<00:05:48.340> really

00:05:48.600 --> 00:05:48.610 
chemistry which i've heard is really

00:05:48.610 --> 00:05:51.690 
chemistry which i've heard is really
really<00:05:48.760> hard<00:05:49.180> and<00:05:49.990> I'm<00:05:50.200> definitely<00:05:50.680> not<00:05:51.400> good

00:05:51.690 --> 00:05:51.700 
really hard and I'm definitely not good

00:05:51.700 --> 00:05:53.460 
really hard and I'm definitely not good
at<00:05:51.820> science<00:05:52.150> but<00:05:52.660> I've<00:05:52.780> heard<00:05:52.930> it's<00:05:53.050> fun<00:05:53.260> with

00:05:53.460 --> 00:05:53.470 
at science but I've heard it's fun with

00:05:53.470 --> 00:05:55.230 
at science but I've heard it's fun with
the<00:05:53.650> teacher<00:05:53.890> too<00:05:54.250> so<00:05:54.520> I<00:05:54.550> mean<00:05:54.790> that<00:05:55.000> could<00:05:55.120> go

00:05:55.230 --> 00:05:55.240 
the teacher too so I mean that could go

00:05:55.240 --> 00:06:00.630 
the teacher too so I mean that could go
either<00:05:55.270> way<00:05:55.480> to<00:05:57.060> trigonometry<00:05:59.640> chemistry

00:06:00.630 --> 00:06:00.640 
either way to trigonometry chemistry

00:06:00.640 --> 00:06:01.890 
either way to trigonometry chemistry
again<00:06:00.970> because<00:06:01.240> they<00:06:01.360> messed<00:06:01.510> up<00:06:01.690> on<00:06:01.810> the

00:06:01.890 --> 00:06:01.900 
again because they messed up on the

00:06:01.900 --> 00:06:04.800 
again because they messed up on the
schedule<00:06:02.140> and<00:06:02.700> precalculus<00:06:03.700> which<00:06:04.510> i'm

00:06:04.800 --> 00:06:04.810 
schedule and precalculus which i'm

00:06:04.810 --> 00:06:06.480 
schedule and precalculus which i'm
pretty<00:06:04.870> sure<00:06:05.530> pre<00:06:05.800> calculus<00:06:06.130> and

00:06:06.480 --> 00:06:06.490 
pretty sure pre calculus and

00:06:06.490 --> 00:06:07.890 
pretty sure pre calculus and
trigonometry<00:06:06.520> or<00:06:07.060> like<00:06:07.270> combined<00:06:07.630> into<00:06:07.870> one

00:06:07.890 --> 00:06:07.900 
trigonometry or like combined into one

00:06:07.900 --> 00:06:10.620 
trigonometry or like combined into one
class<00:06:08.350> this<00:06:08.830> year<00:06:09.190> so<00:06:09.910> i<00:06:09.940> don't<00:06:10.210> know<00:06:10.300> why<00:06:10.480> it's

00:06:10.620 --> 00:06:10.630 
class this year so i don't know why it's

00:06:10.630 --> 00:06:14.250 
class this year so i don't know why it's
listed<00:06:10.990> twice<00:06:11.140> um<00:06:11.940> but<00:06:12.940> if<00:06:13.420> there<00:06:14.110> are<00:06:14.170> two

00:06:14.250 --> 00:06:14.260 
listed twice um but if there are two

00:06:14.260 --> 00:06:15.510 
listed twice um but if there are two
different<00:06:14.530> classes<00:06:14.650> I'd<00:06:15.070> rather<00:06:15.280> take

00:06:15.510 --> 00:06:15.520 
different classes I'd rather take

00:06:15.520 --> 00:06:17.730 
different classes I'd rather take
precalc<00:06:16.030> /<00:06:16.450> trig<00:06:16.750> because<00:06:17.170> I'm<00:06:17.350> pretty<00:06:17.500> sure

00:06:17.730 --> 00:06:17.740 
precalc / trig because I'm pretty sure

00:06:17.740 --> 00:06:21.630 
precalc / trig because I'm pretty sure
it's<00:06:17.890> not<00:06:17.980> required<00:06:18.640> anyway<00:06:19.150> twig<00:06:19.510> so<00:06:20.640> cuz

00:06:21.630 --> 00:06:21.640 
it's not required anyway twig so cuz
