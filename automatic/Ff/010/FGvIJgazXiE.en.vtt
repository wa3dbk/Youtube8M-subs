00:01:41.320 --> 00:01:41.330 
next thing I can get an acidic slime

00:01:41.330 --> 00:01:43.250 
next thing I can get an acidic slime
this<00:01:42.330> is<00:01:42.420> why<00:01:42.510> I<00:01:42.540> originally<00:01:42.660> had<00:01:42.870> brutalizer

00:01:43.250 --> 00:01:43.260 
this is why I originally had brutalizer

00:01:43.260 --> 00:01:44.540 
this is why I originally had brutalizer
X<00:01:43.470> arc<00:01:43.650> in<00:01:43.740> the<00:01:43.830> deck<00:01:43.980> and<00:01:44.100> I<00:01:44.160> might<00:01:44.280> just<00:01:44.430> put

00:01:44.540 --> 00:01:44.550 
X arc in the deck and I might just put

00:01:44.550 --> 00:01:46.250 
X arc in the deck and I might just put
it<00:01:44.640> back<00:01:44.760> in<00:01:44.940> because<00:01:45.660> it's<00:01:45.810> a<00:01:45.870> pretty<00:01:46.020> brutal

00:01:46.250 --> 00:01:46.260 
it back in because it's a pretty brutal

00:01:46.260 --> 00:01:53.810 
it back in because it's a pretty brutal
chain<00:01:51.050> he's<00:01:52.050> going<00:01:52.170> to<00:01:52.260> copy<00:01:53.010> my<00:01:53.250> birthing<00:01:53.460> pod

00:01:53.810 --> 00:01:53.820 
chain he's going to copy my birthing pod

00:01:53.820 --> 00:01:59.810 
chain he's going to copy my birthing pod
oh<00:01:55.460> that's<00:01:56.540> pretty<00:01:57.540> ridiculous<00:01:58.370> so<00:01:59.370> that<00:01:59.490> that

00:01:59.810 --> 00:01:59.820 
oh that's pretty ridiculous so that that

00:01:59.820 --> 00:02:03.830 
oh that's pretty ridiculous so that that
seems<00:02:00.030> really<00:02:00.240> unconventional<00:02:02.750> assume<00:02:03.750> he

00:02:03.830 --> 00:02:03.840 
seems really unconventional assume he

00:02:03.840 --> 00:02:06.050 
seems really unconventional assume he
gets<00:02:03.990> an<00:02:04.080> acidic<00:02:04.380> slime<00:02:04.610> kills<00:02:05.610> my<00:02:05.790> birthing

00:02:06.050 --> 00:02:06.060 
gets an acidic slime kills my birthing

00:02:06.060 --> 00:02:07.820 
gets an acidic slime kills my birthing
pod<00:02:06.300> but<00:02:06.479> that's<00:02:06.690> actually<00:02:06.900> fine<00:02:07.410> because<00:02:07.710> I

00:02:07.820 --> 00:02:07.830 
pod but that's actually fine because I

00:02:07.830 --> 00:02:16.770 
pod but that's actually fine because I
have<00:02:08.070> another<00:02:08.310> one

00:02:16.770 --> 00:02:16.780 

00:02:16.780 --> 00:02:24.280 

so<00:02:17.470> yeah<00:02:18.220> not<00:02:18.850> a<00:02:18.880> big<00:02:19.060> deal

00:02:24.280 --> 00:02:24.290 

00:02:24.290 --> 00:02:26.780 

so<00:02:25.290> I<00:02:25.319> can<00:02:25.470> actually<00:02:25.769> go<00:02:25.860> Glissa<00:02:26.190> here<00:02:26.459> and<00:02:26.610> try

00:02:26.780 --> 00:02:26.790 
so I can actually go Glissa here and try

00:02:26.790 --> 00:02:28.820 
so I can actually go Glissa here and try
to<00:02:26.849> get<00:02:27.030> this<00:02:27.180> one<00:02:27.330> back<00:02:27.360> or<00:02:28.200> I<00:02:28.260> can<00:02:28.530> just<00:02:28.560> go<00:02:28.799> I

00:02:28.820 --> 00:02:28.830 
to get this one back or I can just go I

00:02:28.830 --> 00:02:30.259 
to get this one back or I can just go I
think<00:02:29.010> I<00:02:29.129> just<00:02:29.159> go<00:02:29.400> ascetic<00:02:29.700> slime<00:02:29.879> kill<00:02:30.120> his

00:02:30.259 --> 00:02:30.269 
think I just go ascetic slime kill his

00:02:30.269 --> 00:02:33.199 
think I just go ascetic slime kill his
burling<00:02:30.629> pod<00:02:30.810> because<00:02:31.670> really<00:02:32.670> that's<00:02:32.879> what's

00:02:33.199 --> 00:02:33.209

pod

00:02:56.160 --> 00:02:56.170 

00:02:56.170 --> 00:02:58.440 

and<00:02:56.950> next<00:02:57.430> time<00:02:57.490> I<00:02:57.610> can<00:02:57.730> just<00:02:57.880> play<00:02:58.000> warm<00:02:58.209> oil

eventually i assume he's going to have
some<00:03:03.640> kind<00:03:03.760> of<00:03:03.880> degenerate<00:03:04.270> titan<00:03:04.780> here<00:03:04.930> then

00:03:10.660 --> 00:03:10.670 

00:03:10.670 --> 00:03:14.650 

probably<00:03:11.420> of<00:03:11.540> the<00:03:11.630> primeval<00:03:12.020> variety<00:03:13.660> nope

00:03:14.650 --> 00:03:14.660 
probably of the primeval variety nope

00:03:14.660 --> 00:03:19.300 
probably of the primeval variety nope
readying<00:03:15.080> Corrupter<00:03:15.470> sounds<00:03:16.069> good<00:03:18.310> alright

00:03:19.300 --> 00:03:19.310

00:03:23.729 --> 00:03:23.739 
so there's one card in hand not too bad

00:03:23.739 --> 00:03:28.900 
so there's one card in hand not too bad
I'll<00:03:24.739> definitely<00:03:24.860> take<00:03:25.160> to<00:03:25.370> hear<00:03:27.790> pretty<00:03:28.790> sure

00:03:28.900 --> 00:03:28.910

I<00:03:28.940> just<00:03:29.000> do<00:03:29.300> this<00:03:31.330> Glissa

00:03:34.540 --> 00:03:34.550 

00:03:34.550 --> 00:03:37.390

00:03:37.390 --> 00:03:37.400 
and we're going to attack but only

00:03:37.400 --> 00:03:44.280 
and we're going to attack but only
because<00:03:37.490> I<00:03:37.700> know<00:03:37.760> he's<00:03:38.450> not<00:03:38.630> going<00:03:38.750> to<00:03:38.780> block

00:03:44.280 --> 00:03:44.290 

00:03:44.290 --> 00:03:48.559

00:03:48.559 --> 00:03:48.569 

00:03:48.569 --> 00:03:50.390 

and<00:03:48.840> closed<00:03:49.439> eyes<00:03:49.620> first<00:03:49.829> strike<00:03:50.069> so<00:03:50.219> I'm<00:03:50.310> not

00:03:50.390 --> 00:03:50.400 
and closed eyes first strike so I'm not

00:03:50.400 --> 00:03:52.250 
and closed eyes first strike so I'm not
even<00:03:50.459> worried<00:03:50.760> about<00:03:50.790> killing<00:03:51.120> those<00:03:51.209> guys<00:03:51.390> if

00:03:52.250 --> 00:03:52.260 
even worried about killing those guys if

00:03:52.260 --> 00:03:54.410 
even worried about killing those guys if
he<00:03:52.319> does<00:03:52.530> slag<00:03:52.769> storm<00:03:53.040> or<00:03:53.129> something<00:03:53.420> I'll

00:03:54.410 --> 00:03:54.420 
he does slag storm or something I'll

00:03:54.420 --> 00:03:57.020 
he does slag storm or something I'll
just<00:03:54.689> get<00:03:54.810> both<00:03:55.019> of<00:03:55.170> them<00:03:55.260> back<00:03:55.469> and<00:03:56.249> if<00:03:56.909> he

tries<00:03:57.209> to<00:03:57.239> Kahlua<00:03:57.629> cell<00:03:57.810> just<00:03:57.989> kill<00:03:58.170> something

00:03:58.489 --> 00:03:58.499 
tries to Kahlua cell just kill something

00:03:58.499 --> 00:04:05.600 
tries to Kahlua cell just kill something
in<00:03:58.590> response

00:04:05.600 --> 00:04:05.610 

00:04:05.610 --> 00:04:07.130 

I<00:04:05.670> think<00:04:06.240> this<00:04:06.390> is<00:04:06.450> pretty<00:04:06.720> sick<00:04:06.990> with

00:04:07.130 --> 00:04:07.140 
I think this is pretty sick with

00:04:07.140 --> 00:04:10.610 
I think this is pretty sick with
birthing<00:04:07.410> pods<00:04:08.090> also<00:04:09.090> a<00:04:09.120> warm<00:04:10.050> oil<00:04:10.290> engine

00:04:10.610 --> 00:04:10.620 
birthing pods also a warm oil engine

00:04:10.620 --> 00:04:13.610 
birthing pods also a warm oil engine
that<00:04:11.580> also<00:04:11.880> counts<00:04:12.090> as<00:04:12.330> a<00:04:12.360> pretty<00:04:13.230> saucy

00:04:13.610 --> 00:04:13.620 
that also counts as a pretty saucy

00:04:13.620 --> 00:04:30.830 
that also counts as a pretty saucy
little<00:04:13.710> interaction

00:04:30.830 --> 00:04:30.840 

00:04:30.840 --> 00:04:33.990 

put<00:04:31.840> these<00:04:32.020> slimes<00:04:32.290> together

00:04:33.990 --> 00:04:34.000 
put these slimes together

00:04:34.000 --> 00:04:39.290
