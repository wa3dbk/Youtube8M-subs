00:04:58.630 --> 00:04:58.640 
you're also going to be cutting a notch

00:04:58.640 --> 00:05:00.220 
you're also going to be cutting a notch
on<00:04:58.880> the<00:04:58.970> other<00:04:59.090> side<00:04:59.390> and<00:04:59.720> you<00:04:59.810> need<00:04:59.960> them<00:05:00.110> to

00:05:00.220 --> 00:05:00.230

stay<00:05:00.500> attached<00:05:00.860> to<00:05:00.890> each<00:05:01.310> other<00:05:01.990> so<00:05:02.990> again<00:05:03.410> cut

00:05:03.940 --> 00:05:03.950 
stay attached to each other so again cut

00:05:03.950 --> 00:05:07.060 
stay attached to each other so again cut
in<00:05:04.130> and<00:05:05.000> you<00:05:05.960> won't<00:05:06.169> have<00:05:06.350> that<00:05:06.410> split<00:05:06.770> because

00:05:26.980 --> 00:05:26.990 
fold lines and I'm going to cut in in

00:05:26.990 --> 00:05:29.770 
fold lines and I'm going to cut in in
the<00:05:27.410> exact<00:05:27.860> same<00:05:28.130> manner<00:05:28.430> I<00:05:28.550> just<00:05:28.910> did<00:05:29.150> but
