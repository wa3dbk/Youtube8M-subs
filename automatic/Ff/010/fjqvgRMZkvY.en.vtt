just take that I'm just going to focus
down<00:00:05.730> this<00:00:05.970> hatchery<00:00:06.210> you<00:00:06.690> have<00:00:06.930> to<00:00:07.140> rid<00:00:07.319> of

00:00:07.460 --> 00:00:07.470 
down this hatchery you have to rid of

00:00:07.470 --> 00:00:10.250 
down this hatchery you have to rid of
the<00:00:07.620> spine<00:00:07.859> shoulders<00:00:08.160> but<00:00:09.260> you'll

00:00:10.250 --> 00:00:10.260 
the spine shoulders but you'll

00:00:10.260 --> 00:00:11.690 
the spine shoulders but you'll
definitely<00:00:10.410> be<00:00:10.679> losing<00:00:11.070> out<00:00:11.130> if<00:00:11.250> I<00:00:11.340> take<00:00:11.519> out

00:00:11.690 --> 00:00:11.700 
definitely be losing out if I take out

00:00:11.700 --> 00:00:13.730 
definitely be losing out if I take out
that<00:00:11.849> hatchery<00:00:12.360> and<00:00:12.570> I'm<00:00:13.349> going<00:00:13.500> to<00:00:13.559> throw

00:00:13.730 --> 00:00:13.740 
that hatchery and I'm going to throw

00:00:13.740 --> 00:00:15.350 
that hatchery and I'm going to throw
down<00:00:13.889> a<00:00:13.920> factor<00:00:14.309> as<00:00:14.460> well<00:00:14.490> because<00:00:15.089> I'm

00:00:15.350 --> 00:00:15.360 
down a factor as well because I'm

00:00:15.360 --> 00:00:18.470 
down a factor as well because I'm
playing<00:00:15.570> against<00:00:16.230> each<00:00:16.289> tanks<00:00:16.800> because<00:00:17.670> I<00:00:18.180> was

00:00:18.470 --> 00:00:18.480 
playing against each tanks because I was

00:00:18.480 --> 00:00:20.390 
playing against each tanks because I was
feeling<00:00:18.840> a<00:00:19.020> lot<00:00:19.140> of<00:00:19.199> static<00:00:19.560> defenses<00:00:20.250> they're

00:00:20.390 --> 00:00:20.400 
feeling a lot of static defenses they're

00:00:20.400 --> 00:00:22.849 
feeling a lot of static defenses they're
going<00:00:20.550> to<00:00:20.609> be<00:00:20.730> up<00:00:21.090> top<00:00:21.449> and<00:00:21.750> yeah<00:00:22.650> I'm<00:00:22.740> just

00:00:22.849 --> 00:00:22.859 
going to be up top and yeah I'm just

00:00:22.859 --> 00:00:24.200 
going to be up top and yeah I'm just
kind<00:00:23.070> of<00:00:23.100> running<00:00:23.340> away<00:00:23.519> from<00:00:23.670> the<00:00:23.970> brood

00:00:24.200 --> 00:00:24.210 
kind of running away from the brood

00:00:24.210 --> 00:00:29.620 
kind of running away from the brood
wings<00:00:24.480> cause<00:00:24.810> really<00:00:25.140> no<00:00:25.410> point<00:00:25.680> in<00:00:25.830> attacking

00:00:29.620 --> 00:00:29.630 

00:00:29.630 --> 00:00:32.209 

and<00:00:30.630> yeah<00:00:30.779> does<00:00:30.990> have<00:00:31.170> a<00:00:31.199> few<00:00:31.500> zerglings<00:00:32.009> out

00:00:32.209 --> 00:00:32.219 
and yeah does have a few zerglings out

00:00:32.219 --> 00:00:35.360 
and yeah does have a few zerglings out
now<00:00:32.430> but<00:00:32.759> I<00:00:33.000> think<00:00:33.090> I'm<00:00:33.630> probably<00:00:34.130> ahead<00:00:35.130> of

00:00:35.360 --> 00:00:35.370 
now but I think I'm probably ahead of

00:00:35.370 --> 00:00:38.360 
now but I think I'm probably ahead of
him<00:00:35.640> d<00:00:36.270> show<00:00:36.420> so<00:00:36.719> I<00:00:36.750> marriott<00:00:37.530> supply<00:00:38.070> block

00:00:38.360 --> 00:00:38.370 
him d show so I marriott supply block

00:00:38.370 --> 00:00:43.700 
him d show so I marriott supply block
myself<00:00:38.879> to<00:00:41.390> pay<00:00:42.390> attention<00:00:42.540> to<00:00:42.899> the<00:00:42.989> house

00:00:43.700 --> 00:00:43.710 
myself to pay attention to the house

00:00:43.710 --> 00:00:51.139 
myself to pay attention to the house
one<00:00:43.920> Marauder<00:00:44.309> oh<00:00:48.800> yeah<00:00:49.800> so<00:00:50.160> he's<00:00:50.430> turtling<00:00:50.940> up

00:00:51.139 --> 00:00:51.149 
one Marauder oh yeah so he's turtling up

00:00:51.149 --> 00:00:54.110 
one Marauder oh yeah so he's turtling up
with<00:00:51.300> those<00:00:51.420> spine<00:00:51.780> crawlers<00:00:52.290> know<00:00:53.120> but

00:00:54.110 --> 00:00:54.120 
with those spine crawlers know but

00:00:54.120 --> 00:00:56.330 
with those spine crawlers know but
that's<00:00:54.449> why<00:00:54.660> I'm<00:00:54.690> getting<00:00:55.019> the<00:00:55.110> tanks<00:00:55.469> so<00:00:55.739> kind

00:00:56.330 --> 00:00:56.340 
that's why I'm getting the tanks so kind

00:00:56.340 --> 00:00:59.420 
that's why I'm getting the tanks so kind
of<00:00:56.399> thinking<00:00:56.699> ahead<00:00:56.850> there<00:00:57.210> just<00:00:58.190> assume<00:00:59.190> that

00:00:59.420 --> 00:00:59.430 
of thinking ahead there just assume that

00:00:59.430 --> 00:01:02.360 
of thinking ahead there just assume that
that<00:00:59.579> would<00:00:59.760> be<00:00:59.790> coming<00:01:00.350> yeah<00:01:01.350> and<00:01:01.650> I<00:01:01.829> will<00:01:02.280> be

00:01:02.360 --> 00:01:02.370 
that would be coming yeah and I will be

00:01:02.370 --> 00:01:11.090 
that would be coming yeah and I will be
able<00:01:02.430> to<00:01:02.519> take<00:01:02.699> up<00:01:02.850> that<00:01:02.879> one<00:01:09.710> all<00:01:10.710> right<00:01:10.770> and

00:01:11.090 --> 00:01:11.100 
able to take up that one all right and

00:01:11.100 --> 00:01:13.280 
able to take up that one all right and
so<00:01:11.790> my<00:01:11.970> commencement<00:01:12.300> is<00:01:12.659> done<00:01:12.869> getting<00:01:13.200> the

00:01:13.280 --> 00:01:13.290 
so my commencement is done getting the

00:01:13.290 --> 00:01:15.649 
so my commencement is done getting the
tech<00:01:13.500> lab<00:01:13.740> and

00:01:15.649 --> 00:01:15.659 
tech lab and

00:01:15.659 --> 00:01:17.910 
tech lab and
and<00:01:16.659> all<00:01:16.810> the<00:01:16.960> while<00:01:17.080> he's<00:01:17.710> building

00:01:17.910 --> 00:01:17.920 
and all the while he's building

00:01:17.920 --> 00:01:20.520 
and all the while he's building
Marauders<00:01:18.580> and<00:01:19.270> I<00:01:19.330> got<00:01:19.479> skin<00:01:19.840> packs<00:01:20.140> on<00:01:20.500> the

00:01:20.520 --> 00:01:20.530 
Marauders and I got skin packs on the

00:01:20.530 --> 00:01:22.980 
Marauders and I got skin packs on the
way<00:01:20.770> as<00:01:20.830> well<00:01:21.130> and<00:01:21.970> I'm<00:01:22.330> throwing<00:01:22.690> in<00:01:22.869> that

00:01:22.980 --> 00:01:22.990 
way as well and I'm throwing in that

00:01:22.990 --> 00:01:24.899 
way as well and I'm throwing in that
engineering<00:01:23.470> beige<00:01:23.740> so<00:01:24.130> i<00:01:24.159> can<00:01:24.369> get<00:01:24.460> upgrades

00:01:24.899 --> 00:01:24.909 
engineering beige so i can get upgrades

00:01:24.909 --> 00:01:28.530 
engineering beige so i can get upgrades
so<00:01:25.659> my<00:01:26.290> back<00:01:26.500> at<00:01:26.710> base<00:01:26.890> macro<00:01:27.850> is<00:01:27.909> going<00:01:28.299> to<00:01:28.450> be

00:01:28.530 --> 00:01:28.540 
so my back at base macro is going to be

00:01:28.540 --> 00:01:30.390 
so my back at base macro is going to be
well<00:01:28.750> and<00:01:28.960> keeping<00:01:29.440> on<00:01:29.590> top<00:01:29.799> of<00:01:30.040> those<00:01:30.159> things

00:01:30.390 --> 00:01:30.400 
well and keeping on top of those things

00:01:30.400 --> 00:01:32.969 
well and keeping on top of those things
i<00:01:30.700> just<00:01:31.119> threw<00:01:31.300> that<00:01:31.360> one<00:01:31.690> murata<00:01:32.110> megan<00:01:32.590> is<00:01:32.710> so

00:01:32.969 --> 00:01:32.979 
i just threw that one murata megan is so

00:01:32.979 --> 00:01:36.180 
i just threw that one murata megan is so
weak<00:01:33.250> that<00:01:33.869> I<00:01:34.869> just<00:01:35.229> don't<00:01:35.500> want<00:01:35.680> to<00:01:35.830> get<00:01:35.979> one

00:01:36.180 --> 00:01:36.190 
weak that I just don't want to get one

00:01:36.190 --> 00:01:39.530 
weak that I just don't want to get one
shot<00:01:36.430> do<00:01:37.360> is<00:01:37.570> to<00:01:37.780> know<00:01:37.960> about

00:01:39.530 --> 00:01:39.540 
shot do is to know about

00:01:39.540 --> 00:01:42.030 
shot do is to know about
all<00:01:40.540> those<00:01:40.690> bottoms<00:01:41.140> fighting<00:01:41.500> fires<00:01:41.740> are

00:01:42.030 --> 00:01:42.040 
all those bottoms fighting fires are

00:01:42.040 --> 00:01:45.210 
all those bottoms fighting fires are
done<00:01:42.220> here<00:01:43.500> but<00:01:44.500> I'm<00:01:44.650> just<00:01:44.740> kind<00:01:44.980> of<00:01:45.010> waiting

00:01:45.210 --> 00:01:45.220 
done here but I'm just kind of waiting

00:01:45.220 --> 00:01:47.520 
done here but I'm just kind of waiting
because<00:01:45.460> I<00:01:45.760> really<00:01:46.180> want<00:01:46.360> my<00:01:46.630> tanks<00:01:47.200> to<00:01:47.350> come

00:01:47.520 --> 00:01:47.530 
because I really want my tanks to come

00:01:47.530 --> 00:01:51.930 
because I really want my tanks to come
in<00:01:47.680> because<00:01:49.440> the<00:01:50.440> odds<00:01:50.680> are<00:01:51.070> good<00:01:51.220> that<00:01:51.280> he's

00:01:51.930 --> 00:01:51.940 
in because the odds are good that he's

00:01:51.940 --> 00:01:57.510 
in because the odds are good that he's
built<00:01:52.270> spine<00:01:52.630> crawlers<00:01:53.050> up<00:01:53.200> top<00:01:56.130> just<00:01:57.130> kind<00:01:57.460> of

00:01:57.510 --> 00:01:57.520 
built spine crawlers up top just kind of

00:01:57.520 --> 00:01:59.100 
built spine crawlers up top just kind of
filling<00:01:57.760> up<00:01:57.970> this<00:01:58.119> expansion<00:01:58.510> any<00:01:58.990> other

00:01:59.100 --> 00:01:59.110 
filling up this expansion any other

00:01:59.110 --> 00:02:02.580 
filling up this expansion any other
orbital<00:01:59.590> command<00:01:59.890> actually<00:02:01.110> and<00:02:02.110> I<00:02:02.320> didn't

00:02:02.580 --> 00:02:02.590 
orbital command actually and I didn't

00:02:02.590 --> 00:02:04.830 
orbital command actually and I didn't
build<00:02:02.860> enough<00:02:02.950> SCV's<00:02:03.760> actually<00:02:04.420> which<00:02:04.660> it

00:02:04.830 --> 00:02:04.840 
build enough SCV's actually which it

00:02:04.840 --> 00:02:06.450 
build enough SCV's actually which it
wasn't<00:02:05.020> very<00:02:05.290> good<00:02:05.410> at<00:02:05.619> me<00:02:05.710> yeah<00:02:05.979> so<00:02:06.250> there's

00:02:06.450 --> 00:02:06.460 
wasn't very good at me yeah so there's

00:02:06.460 --> 00:02:08.340 
wasn't very good at me yeah so there's
all<00:02:06.670> the<00:02:06.820> spine<00:02:07.119> crawlers<00:02:07.660> coming<00:02:07.990> up<00:02:08.140> in<00:02:08.320> a

00:02:08.340 --> 00:02:08.350 
all the spine crawlers coming up in a

00:02:08.350 --> 00:02:12.870 
all the spine crawlers coming up in a
second<00:02:08.860> hatchery<00:02:09.369> I<00:02:11.040> don't<00:02:12.040> see<00:02:12.370> too<00:02:12.580> much<00:02:12.700> in

00:02:12.870 --> 00:02:12.880 
second hatchery I don't see too much in

00:02:12.880 --> 00:02:14.670 
second hatchery I don't see too much in
the<00:02:12.940> way<00:02:12.970> of<00:02:13.090> the<00:02:13.209> units<00:02:13.600> so<00:02:14.380> I'm<00:02:14.470> just<00:02:14.560> gonna

00:02:14.670 --> 00:02:14.680 
the way of the units so I'm just gonna

00:02:14.680 --> 00:02:17.670 
the way of the units so I'm just gonna
keep<00:02:14.920> pumping<00:02:15.370> out<00:02:15.720> right<00:02:16.720> what<00:02:16.930> I<00:02:17.020> got<00:02:17.230> here

just<00:02:17.890> more<00:02:18.220> Marauders<00:02:18.730> because<00:02:19.480> they<00:02:19.630> can

00:02:19.770 --> 00:02:19.780

focus<00:02:19.959> down<00:02:20.320> those<00:02:20.560> spine<00:02:20.890> crawlers<00:02:21.430> without

00:02:22.260 --> 00:02:22.270 
focus down those spine crawlers without

00:02:22.270 --> 00:02:24.360 
focus down those spine crawlers without
too<00:02:22.540> much<00:02:22.690> problem<00:02:22.959> in<00:02:23.290> there<00:02:23.470> obviously
