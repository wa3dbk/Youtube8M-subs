00:00:06.410 --> 00:00:11.610
 good afternoon my favorite viewers today 

00:00:08.849 --> 00:00:15.210
 Let us creativity will do 

00:00:11.610 --> 00:00:18.390
 orchids so for this we need 

00:00:15.210 --> 00:00:19.320
 here is such a paper background all she 

00:00:18.390 --> 00:00:21.960
 famous 

00:00:19.320 --> 00:00:23.970
 if you have questions I will not do 

00:00:21.960 --> 00:00:26.730
 separate video because such here 

00:00:23.970 --> 00:00:27.949
 Corrugated paper is also sold in 

00:00:26.730 --> 00:00:33.870
 all stores 

00:00:27.949 --> 00:00:39.410
 then wire glue gun a little 

00:00:33.870 --> 00:00:48.739
 Foil scissors and iron I have prepared 

00:00:39.410 --> 00:00:48.739
 I will show the petals in advance as x 

00:00:57.490 --> 00:01:03.770
 go we need windings like this 

00:01:01.060 --> 00:01:06.440
 don't even know what's called for sale in 

00:01:03.770 --> 00:01:08.890
 flower shops or can say 

00:01:06.440 --> 00:01:11.830
 on the site if you do not have it now 

00:01:08.890 --> 00:01:15.880
 we put our forms with 

00:01:11.830 --> 00:01:15.880
 toothpicks are circling 

00:01:20.090 --> 00:01:23.090
 cut out 

00:01:25.950 --> 00:01:34.810
 Now cut out of corrugated paper 

00:01:29.350 --> 00:01:37.360
 here is such a triangle we do it 

00:01:34.810 --> 00:01:42.630
 in order to be on a piece of paper 

00:01:37.360 --> 00:01:42.630
 folds apply hot iron 

00:01:44.220 --> 00:01:48.899
 the path must not be very hot 

00:01:58.860 --> 00:02:02.759
 quickly fold 

00:02:11.810 --> 00:02:25.640
 and our petals appear such 

00:02:16.130 --> 00:02:31.940
 Here we straighten a little 

00:02:25.640 --> 00:02:36.709
 petal so heat wrap 

00:02:31.940 --> 00:02:55.910
 there is to unwind the main thing that were 

00:02:36.709 --> 00:02:58.970
 firmware and slightly straightening our 

00:02:55.910 --> 00:03:03.819
 we also need to heat the middle 

00:02:58.970 --> 00:03:03.819
 be a little bent 

00:03:05.030 --> 00:03:07.990
 give the background 

00:03:14.940 --> 00:03:18.630
 Well, now the fun will be 

00:03:17.310 --> 00:03:22.410
 collect our 

00:03:18.630 --> 00:03:24.260
 our flower is whole dyne and cut off 

00:03:22.410 --> 00:03:28.730
 piece of wire 

00:03:24.260 --> 00:03:32.520
 we will need a small piece of foil 

00:03:28.730 --> 00:03:34.940
 or whatever we need to do 

00:03:32.520 --> 00:03:37.140
 such a basis for this we 

00:03:34.940 --> 00:03:47.130
 wrap the foil 

00:03:37.140 --> 00:03:50.430
 that is, the wire and at its base as 

00:03:47.130 --> 00:03:53.090
 would make such a thickening for this 

00:03:50.430 --> 00:03:56.450
 the sides of the same color are cut out 

00:03:53.090 --> 00:03:56.450
 small circle 

00:04:01.370 --> 00:04:10.520
 so that there is no such big 

00:04:04.460 --> 00:04:10.520
 wrinkles and other small cuts 

00:04:30.270 --> 00:04:36.840
 we start the build process first we 

00:04:34.250 --> 00:04:39.320
 pierce 

00:04:36.840 --> 00:04:39.320
 earring 

00:04:41.889 --> 00:04:54.749
 using a glue gun letters 

00:04:45.729 --> 00:04:54.749
 here the advice is tight and the next is 

00:05:19.930 --> 00:05:23.410
 like a doll
