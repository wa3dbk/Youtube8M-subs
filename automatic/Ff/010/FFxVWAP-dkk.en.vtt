00:01:53.420 --> 00:01:53.430 
tend to decrease the volts so it will be

00:01:53.430 --> 00:01:57.139 
tend to decrease the volts so it will be
approximately<00:01:54.829> twelve<00:01:55.829> point<00:01:56.460> five<00:01:57.090> or

something like that what I have in mind

00:02:00.899 --> 00:02:04.639 
something like that what I have in mind
is<00:02:01.439> that<00:02:02.219> other<00:02:02.460> be<00:02:02.729> using<00:02:03.149> these<00:02:03.960> many<00:02:04.259> coils

00:02:04.639 --> 00:02:04.649

is<00:02:25.700> another<00:02:25.910> configuration<00:02:26.360> I<00:02:26.840> was<00:02:27.020> thinking

00:02:27.370 --> 00:02:27.380 
is another configuration I was thinking

00:02:27.380 --> 00:02:30.430 
is another configuration I was thinking
about<00:02:27.470> what<00:02:28.459> I've<00:02:28.580> done<00:02:28.700> is<00:02:28.880> this<00:02:29.180> so<00:02:29.900> one<00:02:30.170> a

00:02:30.430 --> 00:02:30.440 
about what I've done is this so one a

00:02:30.440 --> 00:02:34.830 
about what I've done is this so one a
this<00:02:31.070> is<00:02:31.160> going<00:02:31.310> to<00:02:31.459> be<00:02:31.610> here<00:02:32.320> one<00:02:33.320> be<00:02:33.560> here<00:02:34.010> and

00:02:34.830 --> 00:02:34.840 
this is going to be here one be here and

00:02:34.840 --> 00:02:40.630 
this is going to be here one be here and
to<00:02:35.840> be<00:02:35.920> to<00:02:36.920> run<00:02:37.850> she's<00:02:38.360> somewhere<00:02:39.250> here<00:02:40.280> once

00:02:40.630 --> 00:02:40.640 
to be to run she's somewhere here once

00:02:40.640 --> 00:02:43.000 
to be to run she's somewhere here once
he<00:02:40.820> here<00:02:41.120> so<00:02:41.570> I<00:02:41.900> was<00:02:42.110> intending<00:02:42.500> to<00:02:42.620> make<00:02:42.830> it

00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:43.010 
he here so I was intending to make it

00:02:43.010 --> 00:02:45.400 
he here so I was intending to make it
that<00:02:43.190> way<00:02:43.400> but<00:02:43.610> then<00:02:43.880> I<00:02:44.030> changed<00:02:44.540> the<00:02:44.750> plan<00:02:45.020> and

00:02:45.400 --> 00:02:45.410 
that way but then I changed the plan and

00:02:45.410 --> 00:02:48.100 
that way but then I changed the plan and
I<00:02:45.590> decided<00:02:46.340> to<00:02:46.550> have<00:02:46.670> four<00:02:46.880> coils<00:02:47.090> so<00:02:47.360> so

00:02:48.100 --> 00:02:48.110 
I decided to have four coils so so

00:02:48.110 --> 00:02:54.479 
I decided to have four coils so so
that's<00:02:48.320> why<00:02:48.560> I<00:02:48.590> I<00:02:49.010> did<00:02:49.310> this<00:02:49.430> one<00:02:49.670> a<00:02:50.140> then<00:02:52.870> 1a<00:02:53.870> 1b

00:02:54.479 --> 00:02:54.489 
that's why I I did this one a then 1a 1b

00:02:54.489 --> 00:03:00.190 
that's why I I did this one a then 1a 1b
then<00:02:55.489> this<00:02:55.880> is<00:02:56.090> a<00:02:56.920> 1<00:02:57.920> C<00:02:58.220> and<00:02:58.489> this<00:02:59.480> is<00:02:59.540> one<00:02:59.930> D

00:03:00.190 --> 00:03:00.200 
then this is a 1 C and this is one D

00:03:00.200 --> 00:03:03.790 
then this is a 1 C and this is one D
right<00:03:00.890> so<00:03:01.670> 1<00:03:01.970> 2<00:03:02.510> 3<00:03:02.590> 4

00:03:03.790 --> 00:03:03.800 
right so 1 2 3 4

00:03:03.800 --> 00:03:12.009 
right so 1 2 3 4
the<00:03:03.890> same<00:03:04.130> goes<00:03:04.340> for<00:03:05.140> 2a<00:03:06.640> 2b<00:03:08.620> 2c<00:03:09.620> and<00:03:10.100> 2d<00:03:10.480> I<00:03:11.480> hope

00:03:12.009 --> 00:03:12.019 
the same goes for 2a 2b 2c and 2d I hope

00:03:12.019 --> 00:03:15.210 
the same goes for 2a 2b 2c and 2d I hope
you're<00:03:12.230> saying<00:03:12.500> this<00:03:12.650> 2d<00:03:13.400> then<00:03:14.150> this<00:03:14.360> is<00:03:14.510> 3a

00:03:15.210 --> 00:03:15.220 
you're saying this 2d then this is 3a

00:03:15.220 --> 00:03:23.030 
you're saying this 2d then this is 3a
this<00:03:16.220> is<00:03:16.459> 3b<00:03:17.980> this<00:03:18.980> is<00:03:20.650> 3

00:03:23.030 --> 00:03:23.040 
this is 3b this is 3

00:03:23.040 --> 00:03:29.720 
this is 3b this is 3
3b3<00:03:23.760> Tracy<00:03:24.799> right<00:03:25.799> and<00:03:26.750> straight<00:03:27.750> nut<00:03:28.310> this<00:03:29.310> is

00:03:29.720 --> 00:03:29.730 
3b3 Tracy right and straight nut this is

00:03:29.730 --> 00:03:36.530 
3b3 Tracy right and straight nut this is
where<00:03:30.360> that<00:03:30.659> CD<00:03:31.310> sorry<00:03:32.400> 3a<00:03:33.349> this<00:03:34.349> is<00:03:34.500> 3b<00:03:35.540> this

00:03:36.530 --> 00:03:36.540 
where that CD sorry 3a this is 3b this

00:03:36.540 --> 00:03:41.270 
where that CD sorry 3a this is 3b this
will<00:03:36.750> be<00:03:36.900> three<00:03:37.379> C<00:03:37.590> and<00:03:37.980> this<00:03:38.970> is<00:03:39.030> 3<00:03:39.390> D<00:03:39.450> right<00:03:40.409> so

00:03:41.270 --> 00:03:41.280 
will be three C and this is 3 D right so

00:03:41.280 --> 00:03:46.009 
will be three C and this is 3 D right so
it<00:03:41.610> is<00:03:41.670> this<00:03:41.909> way<00:03:42.209> these<00:03:42.930> are<00:03:43.140> about<00:03:45.019> twelve

00:03:46.009 --> 00:03:46.019 
it is this way these are about twelve

00:03:46.019 --> 00:03:50.059 
it is this way these are about twelve
twelve<00:03:46.950> coils<00:03:47.400> and<00:03:47.690> four<00:03:48.690> coil<00:03:49.290> parfaits

00:03:50.059 --> 00:03:50.069 
twelve coils and four coil parfaits

00:03:50.069 --> 00:03:53.390 
twelve coils and four coil parfaits
right<00:03:50.730> now<00:03:51.480> let<00:03:52.470> me<00:03:52.500> show<00:03:52.739> you<00:03:53.010> there<00:03:53.370> are

00:03:53.390 --> 00:03:53.400 
right now let me show you there are

00:03:53.400 --> 00:03:56.360 
right now let me show you there are
people<00:03:53.819> who<00:03:54.000> are<00:03:54.359> not<00:03:54.629> able<00:03:54.900> to<00:03:55.019> configure<00:03:55.890> and

00:03:56.360 --> 00:03:56.370 
people who are not able to configure and

00:03:56.370 --> 00:03:59.630 
people who are not able to configure and
see<00:03:56.909> and<00:03:57.150> divide<00:03:57.810> the<00:03:58.530> equal<00:03:59.010> distribution<00:03:59.129> of

00:03:59.630 --> 00:03:59.640 
see and divide the equal distribution of

00:03:59.640 --> 00:04:02.180 
see and divide the equal distribution of
the<00:03:59.730> coil<00:03:59.940> in<00:04:00.180> a<00:04:00.480> in<00:04:00.750> a<00:04:00.840> circular<00:04:01.079> path<00:04:01.560> so<00:04:01.950> I

00:04:02.180 --> 00:04:02.190 
the coil in a in a circular path so I

00:04:02.190 --> 00:04:04.640 
the coil in a in a circular path so I
will<00:04:02.459> tell<00:04:02.760> you<00:04:02.849> a<00:04:02.879> very<00:04:03.209> easy<00:04:03.299> formula<00:04:03.930> read

00:04:04.640 --> 00:04:04.650 
will tell you a very easy formula read

00:04:04.650 --> 00:04:09.710 
will tell you a very easy formula read
my<00:04:04.829> words<00:04:05.040> okay<00:04:05.220> very<00:04:05.849> easy<00:04:07.190> when<00:04:08.190> we<00:04:08.340> have<00:04:08.720> an

00:04:09.710 --> 00:04:09.720 
my words okay very easy when we have an

00:04:09.720 --> 00:04:12.289 
my words okay very easy when we have an
angle<00:04:10.170> this<00:04:10.470> is<00:04:10.620> suppose<00:04:10.920> this<00:04:11.069> is<00:04:11.250> a<00:04:11.299> 40

00:04:12.289 --> 00:04:12.299 
angle this is suppose this is a 40

00:04:12.299 --> 00:04:14.839 
angle this is suppose this is a 40
degrees<00:04:12.599> angle<00:04:12.989> this<00:04:13.620> straight<00:04:14.280> from<00:04:14.670> this

00:04:14.839 --> 00:04:14.849 
degrees angle this straight from this

00:04:14.849 --> 00:04:16.729 
degrees angle this straight from this
point<00:04:15.060> to<00:04:15.599> this<00:04:15.720> point<00:04:15.780> and<00:04:16.169> this<00:04:16.350> point<00:04:16.440> to

00:04:16.729 --> 00:04:16.739 
point to this point and this point to

00:04:16.739 --> 00:04:18.650 
point to this point and this point to
this<00:04:16.859> point<00:04:16.919> these<00:04:17.400> two<00:04:17.609> arms<00:04:17.970> we<00:04:18.239> are<00:04:18.419> having

00:04:18.650 --> 00:04:18.660 
this point these two arms we are having

00:04:18.660 --> 00:04:22.400 
this point these two arms we are having
180<00:04:19.289> degrees<00:04:20.280> at<00:04:20.940> both<00:04:21.630> sides<00:04:21.900> if<00:04:22.109> we<00:04:22.229> count

00:04:22.400 --> 00:04:22.410 
180 degrees at both sides if we count

00:04:22.410 --> 00:04:25.790 
180 degrees at both sides if we count
180<00:04:22.949> V<00:04:23.430> plus<00:04:23.760> 180<00:04:24.330> over<00:04:24.750> here<00:04:24.960> and<00:04:25.139> 180<00:04:25.530> over

00:04:25.790 --> 00:04:25.800 
180 V plus 180 over here and 180 over

00:04:25.800 --> 00:04:28.250 
180 V plus 180 over here and 180 over
here<00:04:26.010> we<00:04:26.490> have<00:04:26.610> an<00:04:26.729> angle<00:04:26.850> of<00:04:27.150> 180<00:04:27.479> over<00:04:27.870> here

00:04:28.250 --> 00:04:28.260 
here we have an angle of 180 over here

00:04:28.260 --> 00:04:31.040 
here we have an angle of 180 over here
180<00:04:29.160> angle<00:04:29.550> we<00:04:29.699> have<00:04:29.910> it<00:04:30.030> here<00:04:30.240> right

00:04:31.040 --> 00:04:31.050 
180 angle we have it here right

00:04:31.050 --> 00:04:34.339 
180 angle we have it here right
so<00:04:31.530> we<00:04:31.650> plus<00:04:31.889> this<00:04:32.039> 360<00:04:32.490> what<00:04:33.360> we<00:04:33.539> do<00:04:33.690> to<00:04:34.139> obtain

00:04:34.339 --> 00:04:34.349 
so we plus this 360 what we do to obtain

00:04:34.349 --> 00:04:41.029 
so we plus this 360 what we do to obtain
equal<00:04:35.660> division<00:04:36.660> of<00:04:36.870> a<00:04:37.470> circular<00:04:38.510> as<00:04:39.510> fear<00:04:40.139> we

00:04:41.029 --> 00:04:41.039 
equal division of a circular as fear we

00:04:41.039 --> 00:04:44.770 
equal division of a circular as fear we
divided<00:04:41.520> 360<00:04:42.300> we<00:04:42.449> divide<00:04:42.690> 360<00:04:43.229> by<00:04:43.349> 12<00:04:43.620> so<00:04:44.099> each

00:04:44.770 --> 00:04:44.780 
divided 360 we divide 360 by 12 so each

00:04:44.780 --> 00:04:47.659 
divided 360 we divide 360 by 12 so each
angle<00:04:45.780> is<00:04:46.020> going<00:04:46.380> to<00:04:46.470> be<00:04:46.560> 30<00:04:46.889> degrees<00:04:47.010> what<00:04:47.639> I

00:04:47.659 --> 00:04:47.669 
angle is going to be 30 degrees what I

00:04:47.669 --> 00:04:50.120 
angle is going to be 30 degrees what I
did<00:04:47.910> was<00:04:48.120> I<00:04:48.389> made<00:04:48.660> one<00:04:49.470> straight<00:04:49.860> line

00:04:50.120 --> 00:04:50.130 
did was I made one straight line

00:04:50.130 --> 00:04:55.219 
did was I made one straight line
put<00:04:50.729> a<00:04:50.910> dot<00:04:51.060> in<00:04:51.210> the<00:04:51.300> mirror<00:04:51.479> and<00:04:51.840> then<00:04:52.349> I<00:04:54.229> using

00:04:55.219 --> 00:04:55.229 
put a dot in the mirror and then I using

00:04:55.229 --> 00:04:58.790 
put a dot in the mirror and then I using
the<00:04:56.270> tool<00:04:57.270> which<00:04:57.840> is<00:04:57.960> in<00:04:58.080> the<00:04:58.169> form<00:04:58.349> of<00:04:58.440> a<00:04:58.560> D

00:04:58.790 --> 00:04:58.800 
the tool which is in the form of a D

00:04:58.800 --> 00:05:01.700 
the tool which is in the form of a D
which<00:04:59.699> can<00:04:59.940> tell<00:05:00.330> you<00:05:00.479> the<00:05:00.630> angle<00:05:00.960> so<00:05:01.410> this<00:05:01.590> is

00:05:01.700 --> 00:05:01.710 
which can tell you the angle so this is

00:05:01.710 --> 00:05:03.710 
which can tell you the angle so this is
30<00:05:01.889> degrees<00:05:02.130> this<00:05:02.490> is<00:05:02.639> 30<00:05:02.820> degrees<00:05:03.210> each<00:05:03.449> and

00:05:03.710 --> 00:05:03.720 
30 degrees this is 30 degrees each and

00:05:03.720 --> 00:05:05.270 
30 degrees this is 30 degrees each and
every<00:05:03.960> angle<00:05:04.289> is<00:05:04.500> up<00:05:04.620> 30<00:05:04.919> degrees

00:05:05.270 --> 00:05:05.280 
every angle is up 30 degrees

00:05:05.280 --> 00:05:07.370 
every angle is up 30 degrees
this<00:05:05.789> is<00:05:05.940> the<00:05:06.060> way<00:05:06.210> I<00:05:06.240> have<00:05:06.449> divided<00:05:06.960> it<00:05:07.199> into

00:05:07.370 --> 00:05:07.380 
this is the way I have divided it into

00:05:07.380 --> 00:05:12.260 
this is the way I have divided it into
people<00:05:08.070> 12<00:05:09.770> divisions<00:05:10.770> I<00:05:11.190> have<00:05:11.729> divided<00:05:12.030> this

00:05:12.260 --> 00:05:12.270 
people 12 divisions I have divided this

00:05:12.270 --> 00:05:16.040 
people 12 divisions I have divided this
circle<00:05:12.630> into<00:05:12.810> 12<00:05:13.710> equal<00:05:13.919> divisions<00:05:14.630> this<00:05:15.630> is<00:05:15.840> a

00:05:16.040 --> 00:05:16.050 
circle into 12 equal divisions this is a

00:05:16.050 --> 00:05:20.210 
circle into 12 equal divisions this is a
very<00:05:16.440> much<00:05:17.250> homemade<00:05:18.199> coil<00:05:19.199> winder<00:05:19.740> I<00:05:19.800> did<00:05:20.070> in

00:05:20.210 --> 00:05:20.220 
very much homemade coil winder I did in

00:05:20.220 --> 00:05:22.370 
very much homemade coil winder I did in
myself<00:05:20.430> I<00:05:20.849> had<00:05:21.060> some<00:05:21.300> piece<00:05:21.570> of<00:05:21.720> wood<00:05:21.990> laying

00:05:22.370 --> 00:05:22.380 
myself I had some piece of wood laying

00:05:22.380 --> 00:05:24.529 
myself I had some piece of wood laying
there<00:05:22.680> and<00:05:22.830> some<00:05:23.070> you<00:05:23.699> know<00:05:23.820> some<00:05:24.090> metal<00:05:24.419> and

00:05:24.529 --> 00:05:24.539 
there and some you know some metal and

00:05:24.539 --> 00:05:26.950 
there and some you know some metal and
some<00:05:24.810> screws<00:05:25.139> and<00:05:25.380> things<00:05:25.680> and<00:05:25.919> there<00:05:26.580> is<00:05:26.669> a

00:05:26.950 --> 00:05:26.960 
some screws and things and there is a

00:05:26.960 --> 00:05:30.950 
some screws and things and there is a
internal<00:05:27.960> cost<00:05:28.530> so<00:05:29.070> what<00:05:29.580> I<00:05:29.610> do<00:05:29.760> is<00:05:30.060> I<00:05:30.360> wind<00:05:30.840> a

00:05:30.950 --> 00:05:30.960 
internal cost so what I do is I wind a

00:05:30.960 --> 00:05:33.839 
internal cost so what I do is I wind a
coil<00:05:31.229> I<00:05:31.440> put<00:05:31.800> it<00:05:31.950> into<00:05:32.159> our<00:05:32.310> drill<00:05:32.849> but

00:05:33.839 --> 00:05:33.849 
coil I put it into our drill but

00:05:33.849 --> 00:05:35.999 
coil I put it into our drill but
as<00:05:33.879> I<00:05:34.059> want<00:05:34.330> the<00:05:34.569> drill<00:05:34.779> is<00:05:34.929> a<00:05:34.959> very<00:05:35.259> high<00:05:35.529> rpm

00:05:35.999 --> 00:05:36.009 
as I want the drill is a very high rpm

00:05:36.009 --> 00:05:38.669 
as I want the drill is a very high rpm
machine<00:05:36.699> so<00:05:37.300> what<00:05:37.479> I<00:05:37.509> do<00:05:37.659> is<00:05:37.959> I<00:05:38.110> do<00:05:38.169> not<00:05:38.439> fetch

00:05:38.669 --> 00:05:38.679 
machine so what I do is I do not fetch

00:05:38.679 --> 00:05:41.179 
machine so what I do is I do not fetch
the<00:05:38.860> drill<00:05:39.069> on<00:05:39.309> but<00:05:39.639> instead<00:05:40.059> I<00:05:40.330> put<00:05:40.659> this

00:05:41.179 --> 00:05:41.189 
the drill on but instead I put this

00:05:41.189 --> 00:05:44.159 
the drill on but instead I put this
piece<00:05:42.189> of<00:05:42.339> screw<00:05:42.610> into<00:05:42.939> the<00:05:43.059> drill<00:05:43.240> and<00:05:43.749> fix<00:05:44.020> it

00:05:44.159 --> 00:05:44.169 
piece of screw into the drill and fix it

00:05:44.169 --> 00:05:46.409 
piece of screw into the drill and fix it
and<00:05:44.649> then<00:05:44.709> I<00:05:44.919> rotate<00:05:45.429> it<00:05:45.580> by<00:05:45.759> the<00:05:45.819> hands<00:05:46.240> like

00:05:46.409 --> 00:05:46.419 
and then I rotate it by the hands like

00:05:46.419 --> 00:05:50.279 
and then I rotate it by the hands like
this<00:05:46.659> and<00:05:46.929> I<00:05:47.709> count<00:05:48.009> the<00:05:48.159> number<00:05:48.429> of<00:05:48.459> turns<00:05:49.289> in

00:05:50.279 --> 00:05:50.289 
this and I count the number of turns in

00:05:50.289 --> 00:05:52.199 
this and I count the number of turns in
a<00:05:50.409> coil<00:05:50.649> this<00:05:50.770> is<00:05:50.830> way<00:05:51.099> this<00:05:51.520> is<00:05:51.580> the<00:05:51.759> way<00:05:51.879> I<00:05:51.909> can

00:05:52.199 --> 00:05:52.209 
a coil this is way this is the way I can

00:05:52.209 --> 00:05:54.899 
a coil this is way this is the way I can
turn<00:05:52.449> on<00:05:52.569> the<00:05:52.629> quad<00:05:52.839> ok<00:05:53.770> let's<00:05:54.369> get<00:05:54.520> back<00:05:54.580> to<00:05:54.819> my

00:05:54.899 --> 00:05:54.909 
turn on the quad ok let's get back to my

00:05:54.909 --> 00:05:57.209 
turn on the quad ok let's get back to my
business<00:05:55.089> what<00:05:55.809> I<00:05:55.839> want<00:05:56.169> and<00:05:56.409> what<00:05:56.559> I<00:05:56.619> intend

business what I want and what I intend
to<00:05:57.309> make<00:05:57.550> is<00:05:57.849> an<00:05:58.059> alternator<00:05:58.659> which<00:05:59.409> could

00:05:59.669 --> 00:05:59.679 
to make is an alternator which could

00:05:59.679 --> 00:06:03.389 
to make is an alternator which could
give<00:06:00.069> me<00:06:00.249> a<00:06:00.459> voltage<00:06:00.909> of<00:06:01.089> 24<00:06:01.659> volt<00:06:02.050> since<00:06:02.860> in

00:06:03.389 --> 00:06:03.399 
give me a voltage of 24 volt since in

00:06:03.399 --> 00:06:06.509 
give me a voltage of 24 volt since in
order<00:06:03.699> to<00:06:03.849> have<00:06:04.029> a<00:06:04.059> 24<00:06:04.599> volt<00:06:04.629> I<00:06:05.020> must<00:06:05.619> have<00:06:05.889> a

00:06:06.509 --> 00:06:06.519 
order to have a 24 volt I must have a

00:06:06.519 --> 00:06:09.179 
order to have a 24 volt I must have a
pair<00:06:06.939> of<00:06:06.969> face<00:06:07.179> I<00:06:07.360> must<00:06:07.689> have<00:06:07.929> about<00:06:08.169> 16<00:06:08.889> volts

00:06:09.179 --> 00:06:09.189 
pair of face I must have about 16 volts

00:06:09.189 --> 00:06:11.429 
pair of face I must have about 16 volts
instead<00:06:09.369> of<00:06:09.759> 8<00:06:09.969> I<00:06:10.269> have<00:06:10.689> to<00:06:10.809> double<00:06:10.990> this<00:06:11.199> thing

00:06:11.429 --> 00:06:11.439 
instead of 8 I have to double this thing

00:06:11.439 --> 00:06:16.969 
instead of 8 I have to double this thing
so<00:06:12.009> either<00:06:12.249> it<00:06:12.550> is<00:06:12.580> going<00:06:12.909> to<00:06:13.059> be<00:06:13.979> 5<00:06:14.979> coils<00:06:15.550> and

00:06:16.969 --> 00:06:16.979 
so either it is going to be 5 coils and

00:06:16.979 --> 00:06:20.579 
so either it is going to be 5 coils and
3<00:06:17.979> volts<00:06:18.369> or<00:06:18.550> something<00:06:19.149> like<00:06:19.269> that<00:06:19.330> I<00:06:19.899> have<00:06:20.319> to

00:06:20.579 --> 00:06:20.589 
3 volts or something like that I have to

00:06:20.589 --> 00:06:22.499 
3 volts or something like that I have to
increase<00:06:20.889> the<00:06:21.039> number<00:06:21.219> there<00:06:21.429> so<00:06:21.459> I<00:06:21.879> want<00:06:22.449> to

00:06:22.499 --> 00:06:22.509 
increase the number there so I want to

00:06:22.509 --> 00:06:24.629 
increase the number there so I want to
make<00:06:22.689> it<00:06:22.899> a<00:06:22.929> start<00:06:23.469> configuration<00:06:24.189> to

00:06:24.629 --> 00:06:24.639 
make it a start configuration to

00:06:24.639 --> 00:06:28.019 
make it a start configuration to
multiply<00:06:25.089> it<00:06:25.149> 1.73<00:06:25.959> -<00:06:26.319> I<00:06:26.559> must<00:06:27.129> have<00:06:27.490> to<00:06:27.639> have<00:06:27.669> a

00:06:28.019 --> 00:06:28.029 
multiply it 1.73 - I must have to have a

00:06:28.029 --> 00:06:32.639 
multiply it 1.73 - I must have to have a
at<00:06:28.899> least<00:06:29.199> one<00:06:29.409> 4<00:06:29.619> volts<00:06:29.919> 24<00:06:30.759> hour<00:06:31.029> 25<00:06:31.419> or<00:06:31.599> 26<00:06:31.959> 27

00:06:32.649 --> 00:06:35.699 
at least one 4 volts 24 hour 25 or 26 27
will<00:06:32.889> be<00:06:33.039> a<00:06:33.069> lot<00:06:33.279> better<00:06:33.959> right<00:06:34.959> because<00:06:35.319> after

00:06:35.699 --> 00:06:35.709 
will be a lot better right because after

00:06:35.709 --> 00:06:37.499 
will be a lot better right because after

it a lot efficient to keep it within the

00:07:05.199 --> 00:07:08.699 
it a lot efficient to keep it within the
range<00:07:05.619> of<00:07:05.829> magnetic<00:07:06.429> flux<00:07:06.879> be<00:07:07.779> better<00:07:07.959> most<00:07:08.559> of

00:07:08.699 --> 00:07:08.709 
range of magnetic flux be better most of

00:07:08.709 --> 00:07:10.879 
range of magnetic flux be better most of
the<00:07:08.769> people<00:07:08.919> they<00:07:09.249> don't<00:07:09.369> know<00:07:09.579> about<00:07:09.669> it<00:07:09.939> and

00:07:10.879 --> 00:07:10.889 
the people they don't know about it and

00:07:10.889 --> 00:07:13.439 
the people they don't know about it and
especially<00:07:11.889> the<00:07:12.249> beginners<00:07:12.610> so<00:07:13.029> it's<00:07:13.179> for<00:07:13.360> the

00:07:13.439 --> 00:07:13.449 
especially the beginners so it's for the

00:07:13.449 --> 00:07:15.600 
especially the beginners so it's for the
beginners<00:07:13.809> that<00:07:14.649> whenever<00:07:14.829> you<00:07:15.099> make<00:07:15.249> a<00:07:15.309> coil

00:07:15.600 --> 00:07:15.610 
beginners that whenever you make a coil

00:07:15.610 --> 00:07:18.809 
beginners that whenever you make a coil
try<00:07:16.329> to<00:07:16.389> make<00:07:16.689> it<00:07:16.839> as<00:07:17.050> smaller<00:07:18.009> as<00:07:18.309> possible

00:07:18.809 --> 00:07:18.819 
try to make it as smaller as possible

00:07:18.819 --> 00:07:20.579 
try to make it as smaller as possible
because<00:07:18.969> not<00:07:19.779> I'm<00:07:19.929> not<00:07:20.110> talking<00:07:20.319> about<00:07:20.379> the

00:07:20.579 --> 00:07:20.589 
because not I'm not talking about the

00:07:20.589 --> 00:07:22.679 
because not I'm not talking about the
internal<00:07:21.039> damage<00:07:21.249> I'm<00:07:22.089> talking<00:07:22.389> about<00:07:22.449> the

00:07:22.679 --> 00:07:22.689 
internal damage I'm talking about the

00:07:22.689 --> 00:07:24.989 
internal damage I'm talking about the
overall<00:07:22.959> size<00:07:23.679> of<00:07:23.800> the<00:07:23.860> coil<00:07:24.159> it<00:07:24.550> must<00:07:24.849> not

00:07:24.989 --> 00:07:24.999 
overall size of the coil it must not

00:07:24.999 --> 00:07:28.319 
overall size of the coil it must not
exceed<00:07:25.479> the<00:07:26.379> limit<00:07:26.740> of<00:07:26.829> magnetic<00:07:27.309> flux<00:07:27.669> how

00:07:28.319 --> 00:07:28.329 
exceed the limit of magnetic flux how

00:07:28.329 --> 00:07:31.109 
exceed the limit of magnetic flux how
much<00:07:28.659> it<00:07:28.959> goes<00:07:29.469> out<00:07:29.769> of<00:07:30.129> the<00:07:30.429> magnetic<00:07:30.939> flux

00:07:31.109 --> 00:07:31.119 
much it goes out of the magnetic flux

00:07:31.119 --> 00:07:34.249 
much it goes out of the magnetic flux
that<00:07:31.990> much<00:07:32.379> it<00:07:32.740> is<00:07:33.009> going<00:07:33.369> to<00:07:33.550> be<00:07:33.669> inefficient

00:07:34.249 --> 00:07:34.259 
that much it is going to be inefficient

00:07:34.259 --> 00:07:38.459 
that much it is going to be inefficient
right<00:07:35.259> so<00:07:36.159> what<00:07:36.429> I<00:07:36.459> did<00:07:36.759> was<00:07:36.969> I<00:07:37.149> got<00:07:37.179> a<00:07:37.959> thinner

00:07:38.459 --> 00:07:38.469 
right so what I did was I got a thinner

00:07:38.469 --> 00:07:41.850 
right so what I did was I got a thinner
wire<00:07:38.769> this<00:07:39.249> is<00:07:39.429> 24<00:07:39.819> now<00:07:40.689> sorry<00:07:41.019> this<00:07:41.289> is<00:07:41.439> 22

00:07:41.850 --> 00:07:41.860 
wire this is 24 now sorry this is 22

00:07:41.860 --> 00:07:43.650 
wire this is 24 now sorry this is 22
number<00:07:42.399> swg

I<00:07:43.690> I<00:07:44.050> just<00:07:44.440> went<00:07:44.950> to<00:07:45.010> the<00:07:45.100> market<00:07:45.430> and<00:07:45.550> I<00:07:45.640> bought

00:07:45.870 --> 00:07:45.880 
I I just went to the market and I bought

00:07:45.880 --> 00:07:50.370 
I I just went to the market and I bought
22<00:07:46.600> number<00:07:46.780> the<00:07:47.770> smaller<00:07:48.010> that<00:07:48.340> the<00:07:48.970> the<00:07:49.480> the

00:07:50.370 --> 00:07:50.380 
22 number the smaller that the the the

00:07:50.380 --> 00:07:52.740 
22 number the smaller that the the the
greater<00:07:50.680> the<00:07:50.980> number<00:07:51.100> the<00:07:52.060> smaller<00:07:52.330> the<00:07:52.720> size

00:07:52.740 --> 00:07:52.750 
greater the number the smaller the size

00:07:52.750 --> 00:07:56.430 
greater the number the smaller the size
I<00:07:53.230> bought<00:07:53.620> 24<00:07:54.100> sorry<00:07:54.700> a<00:07:55.260> mistake

00:07:56.430 --> 00:07:56.440 
I bought 24 sorry a mistake

00:07:56.440 --> 00:08:00.060 
I bought 24 sorry a mistake
I<00:07:56.470> bought<00:07:56.950> a<00:07:56.980> 24<00:07:57.490> s<00:07:57.640> WGY<00:07:58.120> this<00:07:58.450> is<00:07:58.570> 22<00:07:58.960> so<00:07:59.800> I'm

00:08:00.060 --> 00:08:00.070 
I bought a 24 s WGY this is 22 so I'm

00:08:00.070 --> 00:08:03.750 
I bought a 24 s WGY this is 22 so I'm
hoping<00:08:00.430> to<00:08:00.640> get<00:08:00.880> about<00:08:01.800> 300<00:08:02.800> approximately

00:08:03.750 --> 00:08:03.760 
hoping to get about 300 approximately

00:08:03.760 --> 00:08:05.930 
hoping to get about 300 approximately
300<00:08:04.240> turns<00:08:04.450> and<00:08:04.750> I'm<00:08:04.870> sure<00:08:05.140> that<00:08:05.440> I'll<00:08:05.680> be

00:08:05.930 --> 00:08:05.940 
300 turns and I'm sure that I'll be

00:08:05.940 --> 00:08:09.770 
300 turns and I'm sure that I'll be
raised<00:08:06.940> from<00:08:07.390> to<00:08:07.690> go<00:08:07.930> to<00:08:08.320> three<00:08:08.710> volts<00:08:09.040> please

00:08:09.770 --> 00:08:09.780 
raised from to go to three volts please

00:08:09.780 --> 00:08:13.410
