00:00:09.500 --> 00:00:14.809
 band I will not talk in this block of 

00:00:12.200 --> 00:00:17.360
 gamers tv and I'll let you give it to him 

00:00:14.809 --> 00:00:21.380
 the word to claudio and quirÃ³s that 

00:00:17.360 --> 00:00:21.830
 urgently talk about call of duty coast if it is 

00:00:21.380 --> 00:00:24.830
 friends 

00:00:21.830 --> 00:00:27.289
 next comes the review of the 

00:00:24.830 --> 00:00:29.960
 new delivery of call of duty cause so 

00:00:27.289 --> 00:00:31.400
 so much hate that it goes about this and I 

00:00:29.960 --> 00:00:33.739
 I understand why that hatred towards this 

00:00:31.400 --> 00:00:36.080
 Planet franchise is whatever it is each 

00:00:33.739 --> 00:00:38.900
 who is that activision friend have I made 

00:00:36.080 --> 00:00:40.670
 things well planets are breaking 

00:00:38.900 --> 00:00:42.350
 arrangements with each delivery sells a 

00:00:40.670 --> 00:00:44.930
 infamous amount of millions of 

00:00:42.350 --> 00:00:46.880
 units I think are experiences 

00:00:44.930 --> 00:00:48.290
 quite good and with goltz does not stay 

00:00:46.880 --> 00:00:49.730
 back and I feel that some training that 

00:00:48.290 --> 00:00:51.440
 is looking to evolve and offer 

00:00:49.730 --> 00:00:52.820
 new gaming experiences especially 

00:00:51.440 --> 00:00:55.280
 the multiplayer that is the component 

00:00:52.820 --> 00:00:57.289
 perhaps more important this game though 

00:00:55.280 --> 00:00:58.879
 not personal I consider the campaign to be 

00:00:57.289 --> 00:01:00.530
 pretty good I liked it a lot 

00:00:58.879 --> 00:01:03.350
 white number campaign for example in 

00:01:00.530 --> 00:01:04.850
 white fantastic couples 2 I think that 

00:01:03.350 --> 00:01:08.080
 It was also very good modern warfare 

00:01:04.850 --> 00:01:08.080
 3 my tickets 

00:01:09.950 --> 00:01:16.009
 activision in deserves a prize for 

00:01:12.289 --> 00:01:19.219
 sell us plastics for three years and 

00:01:16.009 --> 00:01:20.539
 that is still one at 29 years old 

00:01:19.219 --> 00:01:23.060
 still the stone 

00:01:20.539 --> 00:01:26.420
 then that you have to applaud him 

00:01:23.060 --> 00:01:28.310
 activision but your fire is the sale of 

00:01:26.420 --> 00:01:28.850
 pistols but a lot played by millions 

00:01:28.310 --> 00:01:30.890
 of people 

00:01:28.850 --> 00:01:33.469
 let's see if in this year he manages to beat 

00:01:30.890 --> 00:01:36.049
 because now what record as 

00:01:33.469 --> 00:01:38.750
 put with the thing with hit fight the cannon 

00:01:36.049 --> 00:01:40.460
 you have to see but I think ticket 

00:01:38.750 --> 00:01:42.979
 I think the multiplayer with the 

00:01:40.460 --> 00:01:44.420
 useful more remain as the kingdom 

00:01:42.979 --> 00:01:46.280
 I do not wait for me anymore, but to know 

00:01:44.420 --> 00:01:48.590
 a little more about what's new in 

00:01:46.280 --> 00:01:50.509
 this theoretical code delivery we're going 

00:01:48.590 --> 00:01:53.030
 with the square review for girl and 

00:01:50.509 --> 00:01:54.380
 remember that there are several editions of 

00:01:53.030 --> 00:01:56.239
 this game in which we are going to 

00:01:54.380 --> 00:02:02.329
 explain a little more and show each one 

00:01:56.239 --> 00:02:03.590
 in a seasons let's go with the resin 

00:02:02.329 --> 00:02:06.640
 of house culture 

00:02:03.590 --> 00:02:06.640
 here in band gamers 

00:02:07.550 --> 00:02:16.760
 games review of guys like every year the 

00:02:14.210 --> 00:02:19.040
 revision of a new title of wikileaks 

00:02:16.760 --> 00:02:21.290
 is full of controversy because of the 

00:02:19.040 --> 00:02:23.600
 popularity that the franchise has and 

00:02:21.290 --> 00:02:25.760
 which is constantly criticized under the 

00:02:23.600 --> 00:02:28.130
 argument of lack of new ideas for 

00:02:25.760 --> 00:02:30.320
 the game system however 

00:02:28.130 --> 00:02:32.510
 activision and the studies in charge of 

00:02:30.320 --> 00:02:35.120
 every franchise therefore of modern 

00:02:32.510 --> 00:02:37.280
 warfare as black ops have achieved 

00:02:35.120 --> 00:02:40.340
 maintain the level of quality and standard 

00:02:37.280 --> 00:02:41.330
 very high you will have gotten it call of 

00:02:40.340 --> 00:02:44.060
 duty cost 

00:02:41.330 --> 00:02:46.610
 maybe yes but the last word the 

00:02:44.060 --> 00:02:48.560
 has the player however here in 

00:02:46.610 --> 00:02:50.930
 gamers we consider it a very good 

00:02:48.560 --> 00:02:52.970
 delivery although it is not up to 

00:02:50.930 --> 00:02:55.940
 previous, especially as regards 

00:02:52.970 --> 00:02:57.560
 history is referred to in ghosts the 

00:02:55.940 --> 00:02:59.480
 context of the game tells us the 

00:02:57.560 --> 00:03:01.970
 history of a special squadron of 

00:02:59.480 --> 00:03:03.770
 same name that is made up of the 

00:03:01.970 --> 00:03:05.510
 best soldiers who have fought 

00:03:03.770 --> 00:03:08.500
 battles in the most adverse situations 

00:03:05.510 --> 00:03:11.240
 and that have become a legend 

00:03:08.500 --> 00:03:13.459
 before thinking about taking the role of one 

00:03:11.240 --> 00:03:13.940
 of the posts the story takes us to a 

00:03:13.459 --> 00:03:16.400
 nucleus 

00:03:13.940 --> 00:03:19.400
 composed of soldiers from which 

00:03:16.400 --> 00:03:21.640
 logan protagonist of the game and 

00:03:19.400 --> 00:03:24.380
 who will control almost all the time 

00:03:21.640 --> 00:03:26.300
 once again your mission will be to save the 

00:03:24.380 --> 00:03:29.000
 world of chaos and the known threat 

00:03:26.300 --> 00:03:30.920
 as the federation that is a 

00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:33.260
 organization composed of countries of 

00:03:30.920 --> 00:03:35.330
 South America and those in control 

00:03:33.260 --> 00:03:37.400
 of energy resources throughout the 

00:03:35.330 --> 00:03:40.940
 world with the intention of making a 

00:03:37.400 --> 00:03:42.980
 terrorist attack on the us so you 

00:03:40.940 --> 00:03:46.280
 role will be that of the hero that ends with 

00:03:42.980 --> 00:03:48.290
 these terrorists as usual the 

00:03:46.280 --> 00:03:50.390
 nature of the game will take you all 

00:03:48.290 --> 00:03:53.270
 parts of the world to fulfill missions of 

00:03:50.390 --> 00:03:54.920
 recognition without filtering and some 

00:03:53.270 --> 00:03:58.100
 full of action with the option of 

00:03:54.920 --> 00:04:00.170
 control helicopters and even tanks and 

00:03:58.100 --> 00:04:02.480
 let's not forget the dog called rail and 

00:04:00.170 --> 00:04:04.550
 who will be a fundamental character in 

00:04:02.480 --> 00:04:07.340
 the whole game with the possibility of 

00:04:04.550 --> 00:04:09.530
 control it in several missions at the most 

00:04:07.340 --> 00:04:11.570
 highlighted that we will see is the variety of 

00:04:09.530 --> 00:04:14.150
 missions that involves being in all kinds 

00:04:11.570 --> 00:04:16.609
 of land cities below the sea and 

00:04:14.150 --> 00:04:19.310
 even in space there is for all 

00:04:16.609 --> 00:04:20.480
 tastes however it is a pity that the 

00:04:19.310 --> 00:04:23.270
 script and arguments 

00:04:20.480 --> 00:04:26.360
 so simple and predictable being away from 

00:04:23.270 --> 00:04:29.030
 other deliveries another negative point is the 

00:04:26.360 --> 00:04:31.220
 theme of dubbing in Latin Spanish 

00:04:29.030 --> 00:04:33.410
 which is really bad 

00:04:31.220 --> 00:04:35.780
 the campaign is attractive but not so 

00:04:33.410 --> 00:04:38.720
 solid like others and of a duration of 

00:04:35.780 --> 00:04:41.270
 just 5 or 6 hours approximately with 

00:04:38.720 --> 00:04:43.460
 graphics nothing extraordinary but with 

00:04:41.270 --> 00:04:46.040
 some new movements that do more 

00:04:43.460 --> 00:04:49.610
 agile to the character especially one 

00:04:46.040 --> 00:04:51.680
 swept style now let's not forget that 

00:04:49.610 --> 00:04:54.050
 Each call of duty implies several 

00:04:51.680 --> 00:04:55.940
 different game modalities being 

00:04:54.050 --> 00:04:59.240
 the online multiplayer the most 

00:04:55.940 --> 00:05:01.190
 attractive but before talking about that is 

00:04:59.240 --> 00:05:03.290
 important to highlight the options of 

00:05:01.190 --> 00:05:05.720
 game like platoon round 

00:05:03.290 --> 00:05:07.820
 you will have to face the computer 

00:05:05.720 --> 00:05:10.400
 or to people connected online that 

00:05:07.820 --> 00:05:12.920
 will take the place of enemy soldiers or 

00:05:10.400 --> 00:05:15.500
 infected and hold the most 

00:05:12.920 --> 00:05:18.260
 of possible waves while longer 

00:05:15.500 --> 00:05:21.260
 resist with life you will be rewarded with 

00:05:18.260 --> 00:05:23.690
 armament and skills if the tactical does not 

00:05:21.260 --> 00:05:26.870
 is your thing maybe you want to face 

00:05:23.690 --> 00:05:29.060
 the aliens in extinction mode 

00:05:26.870 --> 00:05:31.190
 a new modality that implies enduring 

00:05:29.060 --> 00:05:33.260
 attacks of aliens while you try 

00:05:31.190 --> 00:05:35.990
 destroy any remaining of your presence 

00:05:33.260 --> 00:05:37.760
 in various parts of the map you will have to 

00:05:35.990 --> 00:05:40.010
 be very clever if you want to live by 

00:05:37.760 --> 00:05:43.400
 many minutes since these beings are 

00:05:40.010 --> 00:05:45.080
 fast and very annoying if this is not 

00:05:43.400 --> 00:05:48.290
 enough is always the mode 

00:05:45.080 --> 00:05:49.940
 multiplayer this year gose offers 

00:05:48.290 --> 00:05:52.910
 several new modalities that are 

00:05:49.940 --> 00:05:55.850
 quite attractive and among them are 

00:05:52.910 --> 00:05:58.060
 the goal is to maintain a streak of 

00:05:55.850 --> 00:05:59.560
 deaths in your favor or otherwise 

00:05:58.060 --> 00:06:02.480
 will explode 

00:05:59.560 --> 00:06:05.210
 we also have tweets that involves playing 

00:06:02.480 --> 00:06:07.340
 thinking tactically and strategically for 

00:06:05.210 --> 00:06:09.050
 leave with the victory but also 

00:06:07.340 --> 00:06:11.450
 you will find the modalities 

00:06:09.050 --> 00:06:14.690
 traditional as battle in teams 

00:06:11.450 --> 00:06:17.690
 individual control of collection points 

00:06:14.690 --> 00:06:19.760
 of badges all this 

00:06:17.690 --> 00:06:22.400
 next to the skill system or perks 

00:06:19.760 --> 00:06:24.920
 already traditional and the different kinds of 

00:06:22.400 --> 00:06:26.990
 soldier and the economy system you 

00:06:24.920 --> 00:06:29.420
 will reward with the game with points 

00:06:26.990 --> 00:06:31.540
 platoon with which you can buy 

00:06:29.420 --> 00:06:34.570
 new equipment skill 

00:06:31.540 --> 00:06:37.120
 weapons and options to modify your 

00:06:34.570 --> 00:06:39.640
 characters but the most important thing is 

00:06:37.120 --> 00:06:42.310
 recognize and memorize you more than 10 

00:06:39.640 --> 00:06:44.440
 maps available so be prepared to 

00:06:42.310 --> 00:06:47.830
 play thousands of hours online to be 

00:06:44.440 --> 00:06:50.140
 very competitive in general call of duty 

00:06:47.830 --> 00:06:52.390
 coast is a good addition for the 

00:06:50.140 --> 00:06:55.150
 franchise that starts a new story 

00:06:52.390 --> 00:06:56.950
 with new characters , however, 

00:06:55.150 --> 00:06:58.780
 is at the height of other games of the 

00:06:56.950 --> 00:07:01.570
 series that have been considered 

00:06:58.780 --> 00:07:03.940
 emblematic hopefully the expected and 

00:07:01.570 --> 00:07:06.400
 logic second part of goes that we see 

00:07:03.940 --> 00:07:08.760
 in the future it can surpass its first 

00:07:06.400 --> 00:07:08.760
 delivery 

00:07:09.630 --> 00:07:13.340
