 water and power if the detergent is not 

00:01:26.790 --> 00:01:31.400

00:01:31.400 --> 00:01:37.590

00:01:34.259 --> 00:01:41.520
 most of the moisture and washing in the morning 

00:01:37.590 --> 00:01:42.829
 just water is enough then 37 

00:01:41.520 --> 00:01:45.930
 years model 

00:01:42.829 --> 00:01:49.740

00:01:45.930 --> 00:01:54.240
 that well-made foam is very good 

00:01:49.740 --> 00:01:57.420
 cleansing for the skin of the face and pretty 

00:01:54.240 --> 00:01:59.810
 delicate well holy foam inflicts on 

00:01:57.420 --> 00:02:03.149
 skin lyceum leaves so for one minute 

00:01:59.810 --> 00:02:05.790
 then without rubbing just washes away 

00:02:03.149 --> 00:02:07.320
 warm water and finally rinse 

00:02:05.790 --> 00:02:11.820
 cold skin 

00:02:07.320 --> 00:02:12.660
 role to narrow the pores of the model 39 years old she 

00:02:11.820 --> 00:02:15.690
 recommends 

00:02:12.660 --> 00:02:19.290
 take care not only of the face but also of sachet and 

00:02:15.690 --> 00:02:23.340
 and clean the skin flesh to 

00:02:19.290 --> 00:02:25.590
 decollete area as a foundation 

00:02:23.340 --> 00:02:28.500
 applied not only to the person but it is our 

00:02:25.590 --> 00:02:32.670
 same therefore believes it is important to clean the skin 

00:02:28.500 --> 00:02:34.709
 not only faces but necks too 

00:02:32.670 --> 00:02:37.250
 makeup remover 

00:02:34.709 --> 00:02:39.870
 after complete cleansing 

00:02:37.250 --> 00:02:43.380
 face rinse about a hundred times 

00:02:39.870 --> 00:02:47.370
 cold water and this thing is small 

00:02:43.380 --> 00:02:48.870
 hike patting that very well 

00:02:47.370 --> 00:02:51.530
 to narrow pores 

00:02:48.870 --> 00:02:54.450
 and clean puffiness care in winter 

00:02:51.530 --> 00:02:57.570
 winter care is different from 

00:02:54.450 --> 00:03:01.010
 another season naturally and I promise 

00:02:57.570 --> 00:03:03.780
 face uses steamed towel 

00:03:01.010 --> 00:03:06.450
 puts on face and then after some 

00:03:03.780 --> 00:03:09.720
 time cools the skin with cold water and 

00:03:06.450 --> 00:03:12.959
 so does several times it improves 

00:03:09.720 --> 00:03:16.590
 blood circulation and the face acquires more 

00:03:12.959 --> 00:03:20.459
 the fresh look of the pair shrink and become 

00:03:16.590 --> 00:03:23.870
 less noticeable also come out of the bathroom to 

00:03:20.459 --> 00:03:28.700
 to the steamed face the prelate puts 

00:03:23.870 --> 00:03:31.829
 ice cubes wrapped in gauze and makes 

00:03:28.700 --> 00:03:35.579
 massage movements for good cleansing 

00:03:31.829 --> 00:03:40.230
 pores from dirt uses a brush but 

00:03:35.579 --> 00:03:40.970
 like a brush as for before were for 

00:03:40.230 --> 00:03:45.030

00:03:40.970 --> 00:03:46.560
 to make foam brush out of the box 

00:03:45.030 --> 00:03:49.500
 goat pile 

00:03:46.560 --> 00:03:51.620
 very well suited exactly such a brush 

00:03:49.500 --> 00:03:53.910
 facial cleansing 

00:03:51.620 --> 00:03:56.340
 just a little money is enough 

00:03:53.910 --> 00:03:59.519
 to make it very good 

00:03:56.340 --> 00:04:02.040
 foam that cares very gently and 

00:03:59.519 --> 00:04:03.060
 delicately and well cleanses the skin from

 cosmetic morning skin cleansing 

00:04:06.000 --> 00:04:12.510
 milk and then wipes steamed 

00:04:09.510 --> 00:04:14.250
 With a towel, thinks like that in the evening 

00:04:12.510 --> 00:04:16.889

00:04:14.250 --> 00:04:17.820

00:04:17.820 --> 00:04:22.200
 using only cosmetic milk 

00:04:20.070 --> 00:04:23.850
 after such a departure all day is not

00:04:26.570 --> 00:04:33.350
 cosmetic milk applied to the palm 

00:04:29.780 --> 00:04:36.450

00:04:33.350 --> 00:04:38.580
 massage movements all over the face 

00:04:36.450 --> 00:04:40.950
 rubbing then washes away 

00:04:38.580 --> 00:04:43.020

 for washing which is very refreshing skin 

00:04:54.830 --> 00:05:00.270
