railroad he sold candy and newspapers

00:04:26.780 --> 00:04:30.070 
railroad he sold candy and newspapers
and<00:04:27.080> he<00:04:27.950> would<00:04:28.100> have<00:04:28.190> stored<00:04:28.550> his<00:04:28.850> supply<00:04:29.420> in<00:04:29.840> a

and he would have stored his supply in a
combination<00:04:30.710> car<00:04:30.950> like<00:04:31.190> this<00:04:31.400> as<00:04:31.610> cars<00:04:31.850> half

00:04:32.080 --> 00:04:32.090 
combination car like this as cars half

00:04:32.090 --> 00:04:34.570 
combination car like this as cars half
passenger<00:04:32.690> half<00:04:32.900> baggage<00:04:33.320> and<00:04:33.500> so<00:04:34.250> this<00:04:34.430> would

00:04:34.570 --> 00:04:34.580 
passenger half baggage and so this would

00:04:34.580 --> 00:04:35.980 
passenger half baggage and so this would
have<00:04:34.670> been<00:04:34.730> the<00:04:34.850> car<00:04:35.030> he<00:04:35.210> would<00:04:35.330> have<00:04:35.450> rode<00:04:35.840> in

00:04:35.980 --> 00:04:35.990 
have been the car he would have rode in

00:04:35.990 --> 00:04:38.140 
have been the car he would have rode in
with<00:04:36.170> the<00:04:36.230> crew<00:04:36.650> talked<00:04:37.010> to<00:04:37.190> the<00:04:37.310> crew<00:04:37.580> I've

00:04:38.140 --> 00:04:38.150 
with the crew talked to the crew I've

00:04:38.150 --> 00:04:39.580 
with the crew talked to the crew I've
heard<00:04:38.390> stories<00:04:38.660> that<00:04:38.960> he<00:04:39.080> was<00:04:39.200> even<00:04:39.290> allowed

00:04:39.580 --> 00:04:39.590 
heard stories that he was even allowed

00:04:39.590 --> 00:04:41.140 
heard stories that he was even allowed
to<00:04:39.620> go<00:04:39.860> up<00:04:39.950> into<00:04:40.100> the<00:04:40.250> engine<00:04:40.610> with<00:04:41.060> the

00:04:41.140 --> 00:04:41.150 
to go up into the engine with the

00:04:41.150 --> 00:04:43.030 
to go up into the engine with the
engineers<00:04:41.600> and<00:04:41.750> operate<00:04:42.050> the<00:04:42.170> equipment<00:04:42.350> and

00:04:43.030 --> 00:04:43.040 
engineers and operate the equipment and

00:04:43.040 --> 00:04:45.670 
engineers and operate the equipment and
so<00:04:43.250> this<00:04:43.400> was<00:04:43.520> Walt's<00:04:43.790> favorite<00:04:44.090> car<00:04:44.300> it's<00:04:45.050> one

00:04:45.670 --> 00:04:45.680 
so this was Walt's favorite car it's one

00:04:45.680 --> 00:04:47.350 
so this was Walt's favorite car it's one
of<00:04:45.800> those<00:04:45.920> unique<00:04:46.280> artifacts<00:04:46.790> that<00:04:47.090> Walt

00:04:47.350 --> 00:04:47.360 
of those unique artifacts that Walt

00:04:47.360 --> 00:04:49.270 
of those unique artifacts that Walt
actually<00:04:47.960> touched<00:04:48.260> he<00:04:48.650> would<00:04:48.860> have<00:04:48.980> walked

00:04:49.270 --> 00:04:49.280 
actually touched he would have walked

00:04:49.280 --> 00:04:51.190 
actually touched he would have walked
through<00:04:49.550> here<00:04:49.850> he<00:04:50.000> approved<00:04:50.420> the<00:04:50.600> design<00:04:50.810> of

00:04:51.190 --> 00:04:51.200 
through here he approved the design of

00:04:51.200 --> 00:04:52.900 
through here he approved the design of
the<00:04:51.290> stencils

00:04:52.900 --> 00:04:52.910 
the stencils

00:04:52.910 --> 00:04:54.910 
the stencils
I'm<00:04:53.150> sure<00:04:53.540> the<00:04:53.750> paint<00:04:53.990> scheme<00:04:54.170> everything<00:04:54.770> was

00:04:54.910 --> 00:04:54.920 
I'm sure the paint scheme everything was

00:04:54.920 --> 00:04:56.710 
I'm sure the paint scheme everything was
in<00:04:55.190> those<00:04:55.340> days<00:04:55.580> was<00:04:55.790> approved<00:04:56.120> by<00:04:56.300> Walt<00:04:56.540> and

00:04:56.710 --> 00:04:56.720 
in those days was approved by Walt and

00:04:56.720 --> 00:05:22.070 
in those days was approved by Walt and
so<00:04:56.900> this<00:04:57.110> car<00:04:57.380> is<00:04:57.410> what<00:04:58.220> Walt<00:04:58.520> wanted

00:05:22.070 --> 00:05:22.080 

00:05:22.080 --> 00:05:25.619 

that<00:05:23.080> for<00:05:23.259> me<00:05:23.379> this<00:05:23.560> was<00:05:24.330> closing<00:05:25.330> the<00:05:25.419> loop

00:05:25.619 --> 00:05:25.629 
that for me this was closing the loop

00:05:25.629 --> 00:05:29.070 
that for me this was closing the loop
because<00:05:25.900> when<00:05:26.379> I<00:05:26.409> was<00:05:26.740> a<00:05:26.770> 12<00:05:27.189> year<00:05:27.430> old<00:05:28.080> at
