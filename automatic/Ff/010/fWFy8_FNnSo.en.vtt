00:00:41.900 --> 00:00:41.910 
make sure that when you're using this

00:00:41.910 --> 00:00:44.959 
make sure that when you're using this
method<00:00:42.390> make<00:00:43.350> sure<00:00:43.559> you<00:00:43.890> check<00:00:44.700> all<00:00:44.940> the

00:00:44.959 --> 00:00:44.969 
method make sure you check all the

00:00:47.869 --> 00:00:47.879 
underside of the leaves and then use a

00:00:47.879 --> 00:00:51.380 
underside of the leaves and then use a
hose<00:00:48.629> and<00:00:49.079> water<00:00:49.469> to<00:00:49.920> just<00:00:50.129> spray<00:00:50.399> down<00:00:50.640> and

00:00:55.310 --> 00:00:55.320 
remove all the white fly larvae eggs as

00:00:55.320 --> 00:00:58.639 
remove all the white fly larvae eggs as
well<00:00:55.829> as<00:00:56.129> the<00:00:56.280> white<00:00:56.430> flies<00:00:56.730> themselves<00:00:57.649> this

00:00:58.639 --> 00:00:58.649 
well as the white flies themselves this

00:00:58.649 --> 00:01:00.680 
well as the white flies themselves this
method<00:00:59.010> works<00:00:59.280> great<00:00:59.609> when<00:00:59.910> you<00:01:00.149> have<00:01:00.300> a<00:01:00.329> large

00:01:00.680 --> 00:01:00.690 
method works great when you have a large

00:01:00.690 --> 00:01:03.349 
method works great when you have a large
area<00:01:00.989> that's<00:01:01.500> infected<00:01:02.039> for<00:01:02.670> example<00:01:03.149> this

00:01:03.349 --> 00:01:03.359 
area that's infected for example this

00:01:03.359 --> 00:01:06.039 
area that's infected for example this
hibiscus<00:01:04.049> plant<00:01:04.409> was<00:01:04.710> pretty<00:01:05.129> much<00:01:05.369> all

00:01:06.039 --> 00:01:06.049 
hibiscus plant was pretty much all

00:01:06.049 --> 00:01:09.980 
hibiscus plant was pretty much all
infested<00:01:07.049> with<00:01:07.290> white<00:01:07.530> flies<00:01:08.540> now<00:01:09.540> sometimes

00:01:09.980 --> 00:01:09.990 
infested with white flies now sometimes

00:01:09.990 --> 00:01:11.480 
infested with white flies now sometimes
you<00:01:10.140> might<00:01:10.290> have<00:01:10.560> leaves<00:01:10.830> that<00:01:10.950> are<00:01:11.189> very

00:01:11.480 --> 00:01:11.490 
you might have leaves that are very

00:01:11.490 --> 00:01:14.480 
you might have leaves that are very
infested<00:01:12.030> with<00:01:12.540> white<00:01:12.780> flies<00:01:13.080> eggs<00:01:14.070> as<00:01:14.460> well

00:01:14.480 --> 00:01:14.490 
infested with white flies eggs as well

00:01:14.490 --> 00:01:16.760 
infested with white flies eggs as well
as<00:01:14.760> larvae<00:01:15.240> as<00:01:16.020> well<00:01:16.200> as<00:01:16.320> the<00:01:16.409> white<00:01:16.560> flies

00:01:16.760 --> 00:01:16.770 
as larvae as well as the white flies

00:01:16.770 --> 00:01:19.190 
as larvae as well as the white flies
themselves<00:01:17.340> so<00:01:17.939> it's<00:01:18.060> easiest<00:01:18.600> to<00:01:18.720> just<00:01:18.750> toss

00:01:19.190 --> 00:01:19.200 
themselves so it's easiest to just toss

00:01:19.200 --> 00:01:22.359 
themselves so it's easiest to just toss
them<00:01:19.409> out<00:01:19.650> and<00:01:19.890> throw<00:01:20.130> them

00:01:22.359 --> 00:01:22.369 

00:01:22.369 --> 00:01:24.550 

the<00:01:23.119> second<00:01:23.510> method<00:01:23.630> that<00:01:23.810> we<00:01:24.049> will<00:01:24.140> see<00:01:24.380> today

00:01:24.550 --> 00:01:24.560 
the second method that we will see today

00:01:24.560 --> 00:01:27.580 
the second method that we will see today
to<00:01:25.040> control<00:01:25.430> white<00:01:25.700> flies<00:01:26.000> is<00:01:26.659> to<00:01:27.049> use<00:01:27.229> a

00:01:27.580 --> 00:01:27.590 
to control white flies is to use a

00:01:27.590 --> 00:01:30.760 
to control white flies is to use a
yellow<00:01:28.159> sticky<00:01:28.580> trap<00:01:28.909> now<00:01:29.840> this<00:01:30.170> method<00:01:30.500> works

00:01:30.760 --> 00:01:30.770 
yellow sticky trap now this method works

00:01:30.770 --> 00:01:33.100 
yellow sticky trap now this method works
really<00:01:31.070> well<00:01:31.460> because<00:01:32.000> white<00:01:32.479> flies<00:01:32.810> get

00:01:33.100 --> 00:01:33.110 
really well because white flies get

00:01:33.110 --> 00:01:36.070 
really well because white flies get
attracted<00:01:33.770> to<00:01:33.950> the<00:01:34.100> yellow<00:01:34.460> color<00:01:34.729> and<00:01:35.090> they

00:01:36.070 --> 00:01:36.080 
attracted to the yellow color and they

00:01:36.080 --> 00:01:40.149 
attracted to the yellow color and they
go<00:01:36.680> towards<00:01:37.070> it<00:01:37.280> and<00:01:37.549> get<00:01:37.880> stuck<00:01:38.649> and<00:01:39.649> it<00:01:39.890> works

00:01:40.149 --> 00:01:40.159 
go towards it and get stuck and it works

00:01:40.159 --> 00:01:43.530 
go towards it and get stuck and it works
great<00:01:40.520> for<00:01:41.110> all<00:01:42.110> your<00:01:42.320> vegetable<00:01:42.740> crops<00:01:43.070> and

00:01:43.530 --> 00:01:43.540 
great for all your vegetable crops and

00:01:43.540 --> 00:01:47.050 
great for all your vegetable crops and
it<00:01:44.540> does<00:01:44.840> really<00:01:45.020> a<00:01:45.200> good<00:01:45.500> job<00:01:45.860> because<00:01:46.190> it<00:01:46.880> not

00:01:47.050 --> 00:01:47.060 
it does really a good job because it not

00:01:47.060 --> 00:01:49.060 
it does really a good job because it not
only<00:01:47.090> captures<00:01:47.630> white<00:01:47.840> flies<00:01:48.229> but<00:01:48.770> can<00:01:48.950> also

00:01:49.060 --> 00:01:49.070 
only captures white flies but can also

00:01:49.070 --> 00:01:52.030 
only captures white flies but can also
capture<00:01:49.399> offense<00:01:50.200> so<00:01:51.200> as<00:01:51.290> you<00:01:51.380> can<00:01:51.500> see<00:01:51.710> here

00:01:52.030 --> 00:01:52.040 
capture offense so as you can see here

00:01:52.040 --> 00:01:55.779 
capture offense so as you can see here
I've<00:01:52.250> tied<00:01:52.549> this<00:01:53.470> yellow<00:01:54.470> sticky<00:01:54.979> trap<00:01:55.280> next

00:01:55.779 --> 00:01:55.789 
I've tied this yellow sticky trap next

00:01:55.789 --> 00:01:58.330 
I've tied this yellow sticky trap next
to<00:01:55.880> my<00:01:56.000> tomato<00:01:56.300> plants<00:01:56.810> and<00:01:56.990> by<00:01:57.920> making<00:01:58.190> sure

00:01:58.330 --> 00:01:58.340 
to my tomato plants and by making sure

00:01:58.340 --> 00:02:01.380 
to my tomato plants and by making sure
that<00:01:58.759> white<00:01:59.060> flies<00:01:59.360> are<00:01:59.570> not<00:01:59.720> around<00:02:00.020> you<00:02:00.770> can

00:02:01.380 --> 00:02:01.390 
that white flies are not around you can

00:02:01.390 --> 00:02:03.850 
that white flies are not around you can
ensure<00:02:02.390> healthy<00:02:02.810> vegetables<00:02:03.409> that<00:02:03.679> are

00:02:03.850 --> 00:02:03.860 
ensure healthy vegetables that are

00:02:10.600 --> 00:02:10.610 
flies is that they carry diseases from

00:02:10.610 --> 00:02:13.300 
flies is that they carry diseases from
one<00:02:10.850> plant<00:02:11.180> to<00:02:11.269> the<00:02:11.390> other<00:02:11.630> and<00:02:12.019> really<00:02:12.890> infest
