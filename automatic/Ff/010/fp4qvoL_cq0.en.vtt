ones<00:03:44.799> coming<00:03:45.220> over<00:03:45.489> and<00:03:45.699> hoping<00:03:46.120> that<00:03:46.299> he<00:03:46.449> will

00:03:46.530 --> 00:03:46.540 
ones coming over and hoping that he will

00:03:46.540 --> 00:03:49.170 
ones coming over and hoping that he will
instantly<00:03:47.189> give<00:03:48.189> them<00:03:48.370> to<00:03:48.549> level<00:03:48.819> 70

instantly give them to level 70
overnight<00:03:49.659> so<00:03:50.349> i<00:03:50.650> wouldn't<00:03:51.489> be<00:03:51.549> surprised<00:03:51.909> if

00:03:51.929 --> 00:03:51.939 
overnight so i wouldn't be surprised if

00:03:51.939 --> 00:03:53.939 
overnight so i wouldn't be surprised if
he<00:03:52.239> does<00:03:52.479> when<00:03:52.959> he<00:03:53.049> does<00:03:53.199> really<00:03:53.409> stupid<00:03:53.799> and

00:03:53.939 --> 00:03:53.949 
he does when he does really stupid and

00:03:53.949 --> 00:03:56.909 
he does when he does really stupid and
he<00:03:54.009> does<00:03:54.189> talk<00:03:54.430> about<00:03:54.819> it<00:03:54.970> that<00:03:55.720> he<00:03:56.379> does<00:03:56.620> put<00:03:56.889> a

00:03:56.909 --> 00:03:56.919 
he does talk about it that he does put a

00:03:56.919 --> 00:03:58.649 
he does talk about it that he does put a
level<00:03:57.220> restriction<00:03:57.669> on<00:03:57.729> so<00:03:57.970> i<00:03:58.000> figured<00:03:58.419> that

00:03:58.649 --> 00:03:58.659 
level restriction on so i figured that

00:03:58.659 --> 00:04:01.979 
level restriction on so i figured that
i'm<00:03:59.590> at<00:03:59.709> the<00:03:59.829> point<00:03:59.859> that<00:04:00.370> i'm<00:04:01.120> not<00:04:01.180> bored<00:04:01.780> with

00:04:01.979 --> 00:04:01.989 
i'm at the point that i'm not bored with

00:04:01.989 --> 00:04:03.929 
i'm at the point that i'm not bored with
my<00:04:02.109> guilt<00:04:02.379> i'm<00:04:02.620> just<00:04:02.769> annoyed<00:04:03.280> with<00:04:03.579> the<00:04:03.699> fact

00:04:03.929 --> 00:04:03.939 
my guilt i'm just annoyed with the fact

00:04:03.939 --> 00:04:05.550 
my guilt i'm just annoyed with the fact
that<00:04:04.030> they<00:04:04.150> don't<00:04:04.329> do<00:04:04.509> nothing<00:04:04.959> and<00:04:05.470> it

00:04:05.550 --> 00:04:05.560 
that they don't do nothing and it

00:04:05.560 --> 00:04:10.379 
that they don't do nothing and it
doesn't<00:04:05.769> help<00:04:06.069> that<00:04:08.459> my<00:04:09.459> guild<00:04:09.759> was<00:04:09.970> another

00:04:10.379 --> 00:04:10.389 
doesn't help that my guild was another

00:04:10.389 --> 00:04:13.110 
doesn't help that my guild was another
guilt<00:04:10.689> that<00:04:10.870> we<00:04:11.220> merged<00:04:12.220> with<00:04:12.459> another<00:04:12.519> guild

00:04:13.110 --> 00:04:13.120
