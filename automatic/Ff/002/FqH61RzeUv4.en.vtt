00:00:13.270 --> 00:00:13.280 
planted aquarium normally they're a

00:00:13.280 --> 00:00:14.920 
planted aquarium normally they're a
pretty<00:00:13.519> good<00:00:13.760> thing<00:00:13.969> to<00:00:14.030> have<00:00:14.299> around<00:00:14.660> they

pretty good thing to have around they
eat<00:00:15.640> leftover<00:00:16.640> food<00:00:16.970> the<00:00:17.600> dead<00:00:17.960> leaves<00:00:18.260> and

00:00:18.580 --> 00:00:18.590 
eat leftover food the dead leaves and

00:00:18.590 --> 00:00:21.310 
eat leftover food the dead leaves and
other<00:00:18.770> things<00:00:19.180> but<00:00:20.180> many<00:00:20.539> people<00:00:20.810> want<00:00:21.109> to<00:00:21.199> get

00:00:21.310 --> 00:00:21.320 
other things but many people want to get

00:00:21.320 --> 00:00:23.620 
other things but many people want to get
rid<00:00:21.590> of<00:00:21.619> them<00:00:21.920> and<00:00:22.189> they<00:00:22.789> asked<00:00:23.119> me<00:00:23.180> how<00:00:23.420> I<00:00:23.449> do

00:00:23.620 --> 00:00:23.630 
rid of them and they asked me how I do

00:00:23.630 --> 00:00:27.339 
rid of them and they asked me how I do
it<00:00:23.990> so<00:00:24.289> here's<00:00:24.800> a<00:00:25.039> rather<00:00:25.910> unusual<00:00:26.349> solution

00:00:27.339 --> 00:00:27.349 
it so here's a rather unusual solution

00:00:27.349 --> 00:00:30.909 
it so here's a rather unusual solution
it's<00:00:28.009> a<00:00:28.189> snail<00:00:28.579> that<00:00:28.939> eats<00:00:29.449> other<00:00:29.810> snails<00:00:30.259> and

00:00:30.909 --> 00:00:30.919 
it's a snail that eats other snails and

00:00:30.919 --> 00:00:33.490 
it's a snail that eats other snails and
here<00:00:31.640> he<00:00:31.730> is

00:00:33.490 --> 00:00:33.500 
here he is

00:00:33.500 --> 00:00:35.470 
here he is
they're<00:00:33.890> called<00:00:34.100> assassin<00:00:34.460> snails<00:00:35.090> or<00:00:35.390> at

00:00:35.470 --> 00:00:35.480 
they're called assassin snails or at

00:00:35.480 --> 00:00:38.290 
they're called assassin snails or at
least<00:00:35.630> that's<00:00:35.840> the<00:00:36.140> common<00:00:36.530> name<00:00:36.850> and<00:00:37.850> I

00:00:38.290 --> 00:00:38.300 
least that's the common name and I

00:00:38.300 --> 00:00:39.970 
least that's the common name and I
thought<00:00:38.510> it'd<00:00:38.660> be<00:00:38.810> really<00:00:39.050> great<00:00:39.380> to<00:00:39.710> show<00:00:39.920> you

00:00:39.970 --> 00:00:39.980 
thought it'd be really great to show you

00:00:39.980 --> 00:00:42.790 
thought it'd be really great to show you
some<00:00:40.310> video<00:00:40.580> of<00:00:40.940> them<00:00:41.690> eating<00:00:41.960> another<00:00:42.350> snail

00:00:42.790 --> 00:00:42.800 
some video of them eating another snail

00:00:42.800 --> 00:00:46.450 
some video of them eating another snail
so<00:00:43.280> I<00:00:44.350> hung<00:00:45.350> around<00:00:45.380> for<00:00:45.920> a<00:00:45.950> couple<00:00:46.130> of<00:00:46.310> hours

00:00:46.450 --> 00:00:46.460 
so I hung around for a couple of hours

00:00:46.460 --> 00:00:50.080 
so I hung around for a couple of hours
trying<00:00:47.060> to<00:00:47.180> find<00:00:48.250> it's<00:00:49.250> trying<00:00:49.490> to<00:00:49.610> wait<00:00:49.910> and

00:00:50.080 --> 00:00:50.090 
trying to find it's trying to wait and

00:00:50.090 --> 00:00:51.670 
trying to find it's trying to wait and
see<00:00:50.300> if<00:00:50.420> they<00:00:50.600> would<00:00:50.780> actually<00:00:50.840> eat<00:00:51.380> another

00:00:51.670 --> 00:00:51.680 
see if they would actually eat another

00:00:51.680 --> 00:00:55.030 
see if they would actually eat another
snail<00:00:52.100> but<00:00:53.090> I<00:00:53.120> guess<00:00:53.990> mine<00:00:54.320> weren't<00:00:54.560> hungry

00:00:55.030 --> 00:00:55.040 
snail but I guess mine weren't hungry

00:00:55.040 --> 00:00:57.130 
snail but I guess mine weren't hungry
there<00:00:56.030> were<00:00:56.150> several<00:00:56.390> moments<00:00:56.750> where<00:00:57.110> I

00:00:57.130 --> 00:00:57.140 
there were several moments where I

00:00:57.140 --> 00:00:58.780 
there were several moments where I
thought<00:00:57.380> it<00:00:57.440> was<00:00:57.650> going<00:00:57.890> to<00:00:58.070> happen<00:00:58.280> but<00:00:58.610> it

00:00:58.780 --> 00:00:58.790 
thought it was going to happen but it

00:00:58.790 --> 00:01:01.600 
thought it was going to happen but it
just<00:00:59.030> didn't<00:00:59.420> if<00:00:59.960> you<00:01:00.170> want<00:01:00.350> to<00:01:00.470> see<00:01:00.710> one<00:01:01.490> of

00:01:01.600 --> 00:01:01.610 
just didn't if you want to see one of

00:01:01.610 --> 00:01:03.700 
just didn't if you want to see one of
these<00:01:01.700> guys<00:01:01.760> eating<00:01:02.600> another<00:01:02.870> snail<00:01:03.290> you<00:01:03.320> can

00:01:08.800 --> 00:01:08.810 
got a really great time lapse video of

00:01:08.810 --> 00:01:11.800 
got a really great time lapse video of
one<00:01:09.490> taking<00:01:10.490> out<00:01:10.640> another<00:01:10.939> snail<00:01:11.299> it's<00:01:11.600> not

one taking out another snail it's not
actually<00:01:12.320> very<00:01:12.350> exciting<00:01:13.070> but<00:01:13.310> it<00:01:13.430> is<00:01:13.670> sort<00:01:14.060> of

00:01:14.140 --> 00:01:14.150 
actually very exciting but it is sort of

00:01:14.150 --> 00:01:16.630 
actually very exciting but it is sort of

00:01:19.300 --> 00:01:19.310 
this must happen at night I've had these

00:01:19.310 --> 00:01:21.880 
this must happen at night I've had these
guys<00:01:19.580> and<00:01:19.970> several<00:01:20.300> other<00:01:20.480> aquariums<00:01:21.170> and<00:01:21.500> it

guys and several other aquariums and it
seems<00:01:22.159> like<00:01:22.479> I<00:01:23.890> never<00:01:24.890> really<00:01:25.220> see<00:01:25.490> the<00:01:25.850> snail

00:01:26.170 --> 00:01:26.180 
seems like I never really see the snail

00:01:26.180 --> 00:01:28.210 
seems like I never really see the snail
eating<00:01:26.570> another<00:01:26.870> snail<00:01:27.290> but<00:01:27.530> what<00:01:27.680> I<00:01:27.710> do<00:01:27.830> see

00:01:28.210 --> 00:01:28.220 
eating another snail but what I do see

00:01:28.220 --> 00:01:32.050 
eating another snail but what I do see
is<00:01:28.340> a<00:01:28.370> lot<00:01:28.760> of<00:01:28.909> empty<00:01:29.240> shells<00:01:29.570> and<00:01:30.520> the<00:01:31.520> results

00:01:32.050 --> 00:01:32.060 
is a lot of empty shells and the results

00:01:32.060 --> 00:01:34.500 
is a lot of empty shells and the results
of<00:01:32.150> these<00:01:32.300> guys<00:01:32.570> efforts<00:01:33.050> is<00:01:33.260> pretty<00:01:33.830> obvious

00:01:34.500 --> 00:01:34.510 
of these guys efforts is pretty obvious

00:01:34.510 --> 00:01:37.240 
of these guys efforts is pretty obvious
you<00:01:35.510> can<00:01:35.810> take<00:01:36.170> them<00:01:36.440> and<00:01:36.620> Transplant<00:01:37.190> them

00:01:37.240 --> 00:01:37.250 
you can take them and Transplant them

00:01:37.250 --> 00:01:39.399 
you can take them and Transplant them
from<00:01:37.610> one<00:01:37.790> aquarium<00:01:38.420> to<00:01:38.600> another<00:01:38.900> fairly

00:01:39.399 --> 00:01:39.409 
from one aquarium to another fairly

00:01:39.409 --> 00:01:42.910 
from one aquarium to another fairly
easily<00:01:39.560> just<00:01:40.100> like<00:01:40.250> regular<00:01:40.460> snails<00:01:41.000> and<00:01:41.920> so

00:01:42.910 --> 00:01:42.920 
easily just like regular snails and so

00:01:42.920 --> 00:01:44.950 
easily just like regular snails and so
these<00:01:43.250> guys<00:01:43.310> are<00:01:43.760> kind<00:01:44.090> of<00:01:44.150> on<00:01:44.299> a<00:01:44.330> rotating

00:01:44.950 --> 00:01:44.960 
these guys are kind of on a rotating

00:01:44.960 --> 00:01:48.570 
these guys are kind of on a rotating
tour<00:01:45.729> that<00:01:46.729> they<00:01:46.940> also<00:01:47.180> eat<00:01:47.570> regular<00:01:48.049> food

00:01:48.570 --> 00:01:48.580 
tour that they also eat regular food

00:01:51.160 --> 00:01:51.170 
they do occasionally give piggyback

00:01:51.170 --> 00:01:53.140 
they do occasionally give piggyback
rides<00:01:51.500> to<00:01:51.860> the<00:01:51.979> other<00:01:52.100> snails<00:01:52.460> I<00:01:52.850> don't<00:01:53.030> know
