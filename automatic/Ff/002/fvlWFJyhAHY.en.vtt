00:00:02.250 --> 00:00:07.990
 Hi guys, this video, I want to leave. 

00:00:05.830 --> 00:00:09.940
 my condolences to family members and 

00:00:07.990 --> 00:00:13.180
 friends of the victims 

00:00:09.940 --> 00:00:15.369
 this accident in santa maria because I 

00:00:13.180 --> 00:00:17.980
 I am aware that it was not just meat 

00:00:15.369 --> 00:00:22.150
 bones that died that day and were 

00:00:17.980 --> 00:00:23.679
 dreams were desires were future and 

00:00:22.150 --> 00:00:26.470
 I also know that there is nothing that nobody 

00:00:23.679 --> 00:00:28.929
 can say that in time it will 

00:00:26.470 --> 00:00:32.220
 to ease the pain have been so far 

00:00:28.929 --> 00:00:35.710
 confirmed 201 31 deaths in this accident 

00:00:32.220 --> 00:00:37.930
 and that this number of people who 

00:00:35.710 --> 00:00:40.600
 died the same day cause a shock 

00:00:37.930 --> 00:00:42.760
 around the world worldwide 

00:00:40.600 --> 00:00:45.460
 Only in those hours we have to 

00:00:42.760 --> 00:00:47.680
 remember that we have to value the 

00:00:45.460 --> 00:00:49.840
 people while they are alive too. 

00:00:47.680 --> 00:00:53.260
 not only when they lecture 

00:00:49.840 --> 00:00:56.290
 we have to value people and use the 

00:00:53.260 --> 00:00:58.840
 our education and strive to 

00:00:56.290 --> 00:01:01.630
 to be better every day 

00:00:58.840 --> 00:01:04.030
 as a human being, not only the physical 

00:01:01.630 --> 00:01:05.799
 because while we are alive nobody 

00:01:04.030 --> 00:01:08.170
 it measures lack of education 

00:01:05.799 --> 00:01:10.539
 no one measures futile words nobody 

00:01:08.170 --> 00:01:13.299
 doctor grew up, no one wants to know 

00:01:10.539 --> 00:01:16.299
 dreams the future of the neighbor or anything 

00:01:13.299 --> 00:01:18.009
 There is only one tragedy of this kind. 

00:01:16.299 --> 00:01:20.380
 everybody goes into shock 

00:01:18.009 --> 00:01:21.039
 the same people many people who 

00:01:20.380 --> 00:01:24.719
 write 

00:01:21.039 --> 00:01:27.310
 my fears are the same as while 

00:01:24.719 --> 00:01:29.770
 they could be alive did not make 

00:01:27.310 --> 00:01:31.420
 It's less a matter of reaching out 

00:01:29.770 --> 00:01:34.149
 help that person 

00:01:31.420 --> 00:01:36.340
 remember that people die every day and 

00:01:34.149 --> 00:01:38.530
 Today may be your day to leave this 

00:01:36.340 --> 00:01:40.479
 world then when you go to the 

00:01:38.530 --> 00:01:42.639
 other side and close the door 

00:01:40.479 --> 00:01:45.429
 I wanted to leave good behind. 

00:01:42.639 --> 00:01:47.799
 examples and good memories of a person 

00:01:45.429 --> 00:01:51.039
 that linked to the next 

00:01:47.799 --> 00:01:52.569
 when he was alive he not only regretted 

00:01:51.039 --> 00:01:55.600
 after he died 

00:01:52.569 --> 00:01:57.969
 My blog my videos are aimed at 

00:01:55.600 --> 00:01:59.560
 practitioners of physical activity and 

00:01:57.969 --> 00:02:02.889
 especially those who practice 

00:01:59.560 --> 00:02:06.399
 weight that matter escapes consumption 

00:02:02.889 --> 00:02:09.100
 of the physical context but who 

00:02:06.399 --> 00:02:11.769
 what to see that what is most important to 

00:02:09.100 --> 00:02:13.010
 context the soul the same will power 

00:02:11.769 --> 00:02:16.459
 that you have to 

00:02:13.010 --> 00:02:19.189
 to raise 11 changes must be 

00:02:16.459 --> 00:02:21.590
 relevant to your will power that 

00:02:19.189 --> 00:02:23.900
 You have to be a better human being and 

00:02:21.590 --> 00:02:26.150
 Growing up is stronger here. 

00:02:23.900 --> 00:02:28.189
 Today I was thinking of people who 

00:02:26.150 --> 00:02:30.680
 I see in the comments that I read the 

00:02:28.189 --> 00:02:32.329
 things I listen to the things I 

00:02:30.680 --> 00:02:34.760
 law written here 

00:02:32.329 --> 00:02:37.400
 description of my videos and more 

00:02:34.760 --> 00:02:40.280
 strong that we are there are things 

00:02:37.400 --> 00:02:42.530
 that we read that makes us better 

00:02:40.280 --> 00:02:43.790
 there is something we read that leaves the 

00:02:42.530 --> 00:02:46.670
 people down 

00:02:43.790 --> 00:02:47.720
 we always hear say no good without looking 

00:02:46.670 --> 00:02:50.180
 to whom 

00:02:47.720 --> 00:02:51.889
 but when we think about this step well 

00:02:50.180 --> 00:02:54.440
 we think of giving money to those who do not 

00:02:51.889 --> 00:02:56.359
 There is something to eat, we think of giving shelter. 

00:02:54.440 --> 00:02:58.370
 For who has nowhere to live 

00:02:56.359 --> 00:03:03.549
 but if you are not able to make a 

00:02:58.370 --> 00:03:06.560
 person smiles for free is not with actions 

00:03:03.549 --> 00:03:08.379
 falsely to the tourists you go 

00:03:06.560 --> 00:03:11.569
 get your place in the sky 

00:03:08.379 --> 00:03:15.379
 keep the destructive criticism you 

00:03:11.569 --> 00:03:17.299
 It's for you, and work has to work. 

00:03:15.379 --> 00:03:20.540
 your psychological so that you do not 

00:03:17.299 --> 00:03:24.260
 have more because use of these 

00:03:20.540 --> 00:03:25.819
 criticisms to humiliate criticize 

00:03:24.260 --> 00:03:28.489
 someone who simply does not have the same 

00:03:25.819 --> 00:03:31.099
 opinion that its accompanying me 

00:03:28.489 --> 00:03:32.030
 my videos are in the habit of 

00:03:31.099 --> 00:03:34.040
 comment 

00:03:32.030 --> 00:03:36.139
 The cool thing about danilo is that he does not need 

00:03:34.040 --> 00:03:39.169
 cursing relegation 

00:03:36.139 --> 00:03:42.169
 no one to have to feel superior 

00:03:39.169 --> 00:03:43.579
 the deal is the same in the same way 

00:03:42.169 --> 00:03:45.949
 that subliminal 

00:03:43.579 --> 00:03:48.980
 I hope everyone who accompanies me 

00:03:45.949 --> 00:03:52.220
 get good examples that I can 

00:03:48.980 --> 00:03:53.989
 being and applying to oneself 

00:03:52.220 --> 00:03:56.000
 because I think anyone who 

00:03:53.989 --> 00:03:57.799
 in the media if each person who 

00:03:56.000 --> 00:03:59.510
 in the media was able to pass a 

00:03:57.799 --> 00:04:02.060
 bit of a good example 

00:03:59.510 --> 00:04:03.919
 not only my audience but also the 

00:04:02.060 --> 00:04:06.470
 bodybuilders and activities 

00:04:03.919 --> 00:04:08.239
 be better people. 

00:04:06.470 --> 00:04:10.940
 taking this good example that each one 

00:04:08.239 --> 00:04:13.519
 is in the media may be passing you 

00:04:10.940 --> 00:04:16.579
 will start to give an example and not 

00:04:13.519 --> 00:04:19.880
 We'll be better marombeiros. 

00:04:16.579 --> 00:04:23.510
 We will build better people. 

00:04:19.880 --> 00:04:24.750
 we will be examples and the more good 

00:04:23.510 --> 00:04:28.810
 examples 

00:04:24.750 --> 00:04:33.910
 more good people bump into us 

00:04:28.810 --> 00:04:37.030
 street and they smiled at us and did not speak 

00:04:33.910 --> 00:04:40.569
 They did not arrive and they spoke here if they accuse 

00:04:37.030 --> 00:04:43.569
 your space or why, but about will to 

00:04:40.569 --> 00:04:46.590
 you and talk like this imagine 

00:04:43.569 --> 00:04:52.000
 there are many people who think that the so-called 

00:04:46.590 --> 00:04:54.370
 maromas train to feel superior 

00:04:52.000 --> 00:04:57.580
 to others and is not 

00:04:54.370 --> 00:05:00.340
 the few who actually do this are 

00:04:57.580 --> 00:05:02.500
 a bad example that contaminate 

00:05:00.340 --> 00:05:05.320
 bodybuilders who really 

00:05:02.500 --> 00:05:08.169
 use the head and are completely 

00:05:05.320 --> 00:05:10.090
 able to be a good example of being 

00:05:08.169 --> 00:05:13.949
 human good example at work for 

00:05:10.090 --> 00:05:16.360
 example at the academy or wherever 

00:05:13.949 --> 00:05:18.039
 enjoy your youth to be a 

00:05:16.360 --> 00:05:20.680
 good example of an adult 

00:05:18.039 --> 00:05:23.500
 enjoy your adult life to be a 

00:05:20.680 --> 00:05:26.530
 good example of flying and enjoy your 

00:05:23.500 --> 00:05:30.130
 old age for when you die 

00:05:26.530 --> 00:05:33.580
 you have become a good symbol or 

00:05:30.130 --> 00:05:36.880
 that is for a single person because the 

00:05:33.580 --> 00:05:39.880
 anybody's muscular body will not 

00:05:36.880 --> 00:05:42.150
 though what we do in life and 

00:05:39.880 --> 00:05:45.310
 Cooper Eternity Can Change the World 

00:05:42.150 --> 00:05:47.919
 everybody has problems everyone has 

00:05:45.310 --> 00:05:50.259
 you do not find that your 

00:05:47.919 --> 00:05:52.810
 are greater than those of others. 

00:05:50.259 --> 00:05:55.780
 they are different and do not use this 

00:05:52.810 --> 00:05:57.610
 as an excuse to treat someone badly and 

00:05:55.780 --> 00:06:00.940
 do not use from the distance that the internet 

00:05:57.610 --> 00:06:03.190
 It gives you how to make comments that 

00:06:00.940 --> 00:06:07.270
 You would not dare talk in the face. 

00:06:03.190 --> 00:06:10.300
 or in public grow here child here and 

00:06:07.270 --> 00:06:12.340
 You guys from Maromba use the same 

00:06:10.300 --> 00:06:14.919
 willpower you have for 

00:06:12.340 --> 00:06:18.070
 to lift the weight to do good is mine. 

00:06:14.919 --> 00:06:19.870
 close like the epr time does not 

00:06:18.070 --> 00:06:24.539
 hide behind the computer to 

00:06:19.870 --> 00:06:26.530
 expose your bad manners have the decency 

00:06:24.539 --> 00:06:29.349
 Disliked by 

00:06:26.530 --> 00:06:33.520
 ignore remember yes because when you 

00:06:29.349 --> 00:06:37.040
 to point out the defect of someone else has 3 

00:06:33.520 --> 00:06:40.130
 fingers pointing out their faults 

00:06:37.040 --> 00:06:43.280
 I do not know if any known 

00:06:40.130 --> 00:06:46.910

00:06:57.020 --> 00:06:59.870

00:07:10.250 --> 00:07:15.920
