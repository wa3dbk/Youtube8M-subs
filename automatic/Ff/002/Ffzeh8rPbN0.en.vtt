I'll<00:00:13.590> be<00:00:14.549> reusing<00:00:15.150> the<00:00:15.240> line<00:00:15.389> that<00:00:15.660> runs<00:00:15.839> from

00:00:16.010 --> 00:00:16.020 
I'll be reusing the line that runs from

00:00:16.020 --> 00:00:17.830 
I'll be reusing the line that runs from
the<00:00:16.199> intake<00:00:16.500> manifold<00:00:16.980> to<00:00:17.130> the<00:00:17.220> lower<00:00:17.400> hose

00:00:17.830 --> 00:00:17.840 
the intake manifold to the lower hose

00:00:17.840 --> 00:00:20.060 
the intake manifold to the lower hose
first<00:00:18.840> the<00:00:19.230> upper<00:00:19.500> hose<00:00:19.650> needs<00:00:19.830> to<00:00:19.949> be

00:00:20.060 --> 00:00:20.070 
first the upper hose needs to be

00:00:20.070 --> 00:00:23.150 
first the upper hose needs to be
disconnected<00:00:20.279> from<00:00:20.670> the<00:00:20.939> valve<00:00:21.150> cover<00:00:22.160> you'll

00:00:23.150 --> 00:00:23.160 
disconnected from the valve cover you'll

00:00:23.160 --> 00:00:24.650 
disconnected from the valve cover you'll
then<00:00:23.340> want<00:00:23.490> to<00:00:23.580> move<00:00:23.760> to<00:00:23.910> the<00:00:24.000> turbo<00:00:24.330> inlet

00:00:24.650 --> 00:00:24.660 
then want to move to the turbo inlet

00:00:24.660 --> 00:00:26.540 
then want to move to the turbo inlet
pipe<00:00:24.900> and<00:00:25.140> find<00:00:25.410> the<00:00:25.529> PCV<00:00:25.920> valve<00:00:26.310> or

00:00:26.550 --> 00:00:29.390 
pipe and find the PCV valve or
hockey-puck<00:00:27.560> it's<00:00:28.560> a<00:00:28.590> good<00:00:28.769> idea<00:00:28.859> to<00:00:29.160> take<00:00:29.310> the

00:00:29.390 --> 00:00:29.400 
hockey-puck it's a good idea to take the

00:00:29.400 --> 00:00:31.040 
hockey-puck it's a good idea to take the
whole<00:00:29.580> valve<00:00:29.849> off<00:00:30.090> to<00:00:30.449> make<00:00:30.599> sure<00:00:30.720> that<00:00:30.900> it's

00:00:31.040 --> 00:00:31.050 
whole valve off to make sure that it's

00:00:31.050 --> 00:00:39.290 
whole valve off to make sure that it's
clean<00:00:36.230> to<00:00:37.230> get<00:00:37.350> to<00:00:37.530> the<00:00:37.620> lower<00:00:37.829> hose<00:00:38.300> remove

00:00:39.290 --> 00:00:39.300 
clean to get to the lower hose remove

00:00:39.300 --> 00:00:41.420 
clean to get to the lower hose remove
these<00:00:39.510> two<00:00:39.780> bolts<00:00:40.200> and<00:00:40.320> disconnect<00:00:40.430> the

00:00:41.420 --> 00:00:41.430 
these two bolts and disconnect the

00:00:41.430 --> 00:00:43.490 
these two bolts and disconnect the
secondary<00:00:41.879> air<00:00:42.120> injection<00:00:42.149> line<00:00:42.870> to<00:00:43.230> get<00:00:43.350> it

00:00:43.490 --> 00:00:43.500 
secondary air injection line to get it

00:00:43.500 --> 00:00:48.110 
secondary air injection line to get it
out<00:00:43.620> of<00:00:43.770> your<00:00:43.890> way<00:00:46.550> you'll<00:00:47.550> then<00:00:47.760> be<00:00:47.789> able<00:00:48.000> to

00:00:48.110 --> 00:00:48.120 
out of your way you'll then be able to

00:00:48.120 --> 00:00:50.540 
out of your way you'll then be able to
see<00:00:48.390> the<00:00:48.510> lower<00:00:48.750> elbow<00:00:49.350> and<00:00:49.590> line<00:00:50.129> from<00:00:50.430> the

00:00:50.540 --> 00:00:50.550 
see the lower elbow and line from the

00:00:50.550 --> 00:00:53.750 
see the lower elbow and line from the
intake<00:00:50.910> manifold<00:00:52.160> it's<00:00:53.160> a<00:00:53.280> good<00:00:53.460> idea<00:00:53.550> to

00:00:53.750 --> 00:00:53.760 
intake manifold it's a good idea to

00:00:53.760 --> 00:00:55.430 
intake manifold it's a good idea to
disconnect<00:00:54.329> the<00:00:54.480> upper<00:00:54.510> dipstick<00:00:55.170> tube

00:00:55.430 --> 00:00:55.440 
disconnect the upper dipstick tube

00:00:55.440 --> 00:00:57.139 
disconnect the upper dipstick tube
because<00:00:55.860> it<00:00:55.980> can<00:00:56.129> break<00:00:56.370> when<00:00:56.640> trying<00:00:56.850> to<00:00:56.879> fit

00:00:57.139 --> 00:00:57.149 
because it can break when trying to fit
