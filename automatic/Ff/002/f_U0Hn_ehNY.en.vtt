again<00:01:34.850> with<00:01:35.600> the<00:01:35.720> lithium<00:01:36.049> ion<00:01:36.229> battery<00:01:36.650> the

00:01:36.789 --> 00:01:36.799 
again with the lithium ion battery the

00:01:36.799 --> 00:01:38.800 
again with the lithium ion battery the
good<00:01:37.010> thing<00:01:37.250> is<00:01:37.460> that<00:01:37.670> it<00:01:37.760> doesn't<00:01:38.090> lose<00:01:38.360> as

00:01:38.800 --> 00:01:38.810 
good thing is that it doesn't lose as

00:01:38.810 --> 00:01:40.870 
good thing is that it doesn't lose as
much<00:01:39.110> power<00:01:39.470> as<00:01:39.560> what<00:01:39.710> the<00:01:39.799> old<00:01:39.950> NiCad<00:01:40.490> type<00:01:40.700> of

00:01:40.870 --> 00:01:40.880 
much power as what the old NiCad type of

00:01:40.880 --> 00:01:43.330 
much power as what the old NiCad type of
system<00:01:41.240> loses<00:01:41.600> that<00:01:42.020> typically<00:01:42.439> uses<00:01:42.860> about<00:01:43.130> 1

00:01:43.330 --> 00:01:43.340 
system loses that typically uses about 1

00:01:43.340 --> 00:01:46.060 
system loses that typically uses about 1
to<00:01:43.490> 3%<00:01:43.780> naturally<00:01:44.780> per<00:01:44.930> day<00:01:45.110> with<00:01:45.770> the<00:01:45.890> lithium

00:01:46.060 --> 00:01:46.070 
to 3% naturally per day with the lithium

00:01:46.070 --> 00:01:48.429 
to 3% naturally per day with the lithium
it<00:01:46.310> line<00:01:46.460> lose<00:01:46.759> about<00:01:47.030> 1%<00:01:47.509> of<00:01:47.810> its<00:01:47.960> charge<00:01:48.229> per

00:01:48.429 --> 00:01:48.439 
it line lose about 1% of its charge per

00:01:48.439 --> 00:01:50.469 
it line lose about 1% of its charge per
month<00:01:48.680> so<00:01:49.400> really<00:01:49.759> you<00:01:49.850> can<00:01:49.970> charge<00:01:50.270> it<00:01:50.420> up

00:01:50.469 --> 00:01:50.479 
month so really you can charge it up

00:01:50.479 --> 00:01:52.300 
month so really you can charge it up
under<00:01:50.810> percent<00:01:51.140> stick<00:01:51.799> it<00:01:51.920> in<00:01:51.979> the<00:01:52.070> drawer

00:01:52.300 --> 00:01:52.310 
under percent stick it in the drawer

00:01:52.310 --> 00:01:54.039 
under percent stick it in the drawer
leave<00:01:52.820> it<00:01:52.939> in<00:01:53.030> there<00:01:53.180> for<00:01:53.210> about<00:01:53.360> a<00:01:53.540> year<00:01:53.780> come

00:01:54.039 --> 00:01:54.049 
leave it in there for about a year come

00:01:54.049 --> 00:01:56.319 
leave it in there for about a year come
back<00:01:54.259> to<00:01:54.439> it<00:01:54.560> and<00:01:54.710> still<00:01:54.860> have<00:01:55.040> about<00:01:55.159> 85<00:01:55.670> 88

00:01:56.319 --> 00:01:56.329 
back to it and still have about 85 88

00:01:56.329 --> 00:01:57.640 
back to it and still have about 85 88
percent<00:01:56.810> of<00:01:56.869> the<00:01:56.960> charge<00:01:57.200> left<00:01:57.380> in<00:01:57.530> the

percent of the charge left in the

00:01:57.650 --> 00:01:59.469 
percent of the charge left in the
battery<00:01:58.009> this<00:01:58.159> is<00:01:58.220> a<00:01:58.430> obviously<00:01:59.030> part<00:01:59.329> of<00:01:59.360> a

00:01:59.469 --> 00:01:59.479 
battery this is a obviously part of a

kitchen cabinet here we have this the

00:02:02.509 --> 00:02:03.789 
kitchen cabinet here we have this the
screws<00:02:02.810> actually<00:02:03.229> go<00:02:03.350> into<00:02:03.470> the<00:02:03.650> kitchen

00:02:03.789 --> 00:02:03.799 
screws actually go into the kitchen

00:02:03.799 --> 00:02:05.980 
screws actually go into the kitchen
cabinet<00:02:04.310> so<00:02:04.430> I<00:02:04.460> can<00:02:04.670> put<00:02:04.850> a<00:02:04.880> further<00:02:05.450> up<00:02:05.750> right

00:02:05.980 --> 00:02:05.990 
cabinet so I can put a further up right

00:02:05.990 --> 00:02:08.229 
cabinet so I can put a further up right
on<00:02:06.170> so<00:02:06.680> typically<00:02:07.130> this<00:02:07.400> look<00:02:07.670> this<00:02:07.880> sort<00:02:08.179> of

00:02:08.229 --> 00:02:08.239 
on so typically this look this sort of

00:02:08.239 --> 00:02:10.630 
on so typically this look this sort of
thing<00:02:08.479> you<00:02:09.019> can<00:02:09.229> see<00:02:09.440> there<00:02:09.709> if<00:02:09.920> I<00:02:10.100> just<00:02:10.369> strain

00:02:10.630 --> 00:02:10.640 
thing you can see there if I just strain

00:02:10.640 --> 00:02:14.650 
thing you can see there if I just strain
it<00:02:10.820> up<00:02:11.170> and<00:02:12.850> you<00:02:13.850> can<00:02:14.000> just<00:02:14.030> squeeze<00:02:14.360> the

00:02:14.650 --> 00:02:14.660 
it up and you can just squeeze the

00:02:14.660 --> 00:02:16.120 
it up and you can just squeeze the
trigger<00:02:14.690> with<00:02:15.140> something<00:02:15.440> like<00:02:15.560> this<00:02:15.739> because

00:02:16.120 --> 00:02:16.130 
trigger with something like this because

00:02:16.130 --> 00:02:18.130 
trigger with something like this because
it<00:02:16.250> is<00:02:16.370> cut<00:02:16.670> quite<00:02:17.060> feathered<00:02:17.510> on<00:02:17.660> the<00:02:17.780> trigger

00:02:18.130 --> 00:02:18.140 
it is cut quite feathered on the trigger

00:02:18.140 --> 00:02:20.350 
it is cut quite feathered on the trigger
you<00:02:18.560> just<00:02:18.590> squeeze<00:02:18.890> it<00:02:19.400> and<00:02:19.519> squeeze<00:02:19.790> it<00:02:19.850> until

00:02:20.350 --> 00:02:20.360 
you just squeeze it and squeeze it until

00:02:20.360 --> 00:02:21.759 
you just squeeze it and squeeze it until
you<00:02:20.420> actually<00:02:20.570> get<00:02:20.810> it<00:02:20.930> down<00:02:21.140> there<00:02:21.709> and

00:02:21.759 --> 00:02:21.769 
you actually get it down there and

00:02:21.769 --> 00:02:24.220 
you actually get it down there and
you're<00:02:22.190> not<00:02:22.430> going<00:02:22.700> to<00:02:22.790> overrun<00:02:23.630> the<00:02:23.840> actual

00:02:24.220 --> 00:02:24.230 
you're not going to overrun the actual

00:02:24.230 --> 00:02:26.680 
you're not going to overrun the actual
screw<00:02:24.560> it<00:02:25.400> finishes<00:02:26.060> where<00:02:26.299> it<00:02:26.420> wants<00:02:26.660> to

00:02:26.680 --> 00:02:26.690 
screw it finishes where it wants to

00:02:26.690 --> 00:02:28.600 
screw it finishes where it wants to
finish<00:02:26.930> an<00:02:27.200> se<00:02:27.500> I'll<00:02:27.590> do<00:02:27.769> about<00:02:28.010> it<00:02:28.190> the<00:02:28.400> right

00:02:28.600 --> 00:02:28.610 
finish an se I'll do about it the right

00:02:28.610 --> 00:02:30.550 
finish an se I'll do about it the right
angle<00:02:28.730> adapter<00:02:29.329> perfect<00:02:30.110> for<00:02:30.230> getting<00:02:30.440> into

00:02:30.550 --> 00:02:30.560 
angle adapter perfect for getting into

00:02:30.560 --> 00:02:32.319 
angle adapter perfect for getting into
the<00:02:30.799> small<00:02:31.070> the<00:02:31.250> nooks<00:02:31.459> and<00:02:31.610> crannies<00:02:32.090> and

00:02:32.319 --> 00:02:32.329 
the small the nooks and crannies and

00:02:32.329 --> 00:02:34.330 
the small the nooks and crannies and
actually<00:02:32.660> getting<00:02:32.930> down<00:02:33.140> with<00:02:33.739> your<00:02:33.950> work<00:02:34.129> and

00:02:34.330 --> 00:02:34.340 
actually getting down with your work and

00:02:34.340 --> 00:02:36.100 
actually getting down with your work and
I'll<00:02:34.520> show<00:02:34.760> you<00:02:34.819> the<00:02:35.030> type<00:02:35.239> of<00:02:35.420> application

00:02:36.100 --> 00:02:36.110 
I'll show you the type of application

00:02:36.110 --> 00:02:37.750 
I'll show you the type of application
that<00:02:36.140> you<00:02:36.349> may<00:02:36.530> possibly<00:02:36.800> actually<00:02:37.250> use<00:02:37.610> it

00:02:37.750 --> 00:02:37.760 
that you may possibly actually use it

00:02:37.760 --> 00:02:39.510 
that you may possibly actually use it
for<00:02:37.790> there's<00:02:38.180> thousands<00:02:38.959> of<00:02:39.020> Advocaat

00:02:39.510 --> 00:02:39.520 
for there's thousands of Advocaat

00:02:39.520 --> 00:02:41.430 
for there's thousands of Advocaat
but<00:02:39.910> this<00:02:40.330> could<00:02:40.540> just<00:02:40.660> be<00:02:40.780> one<00:02:41.050> of<00:02:41.080> them<00:02:41.230> there

00:02:41.430 --> 00:02:41.440 
but this could just be one of them there

00:02:41.440 --> 00:02:43.470 
but this could just be one of them there
you<00:02:41.560> can<00:02:41.740> see<00:02:42.010> that<00:02:42.460> I<00:02:42.640> want<00:02:42.910> to<00:02:43.000> put<00:02:43.150> part<00:02:43.390> of

00:02:43.470 --> 00:02:43.480 
you can see that I want to put part of

00:02:43.480 --> 00:02:46.470 
you can see that I want to put part of
the<00:02:43.540> actual<00:02:43.750> hinge<00:02:44.140> on<00:02:44.410> so<00:02:45.250> here<00:02:45.580> yes<00:02:45.940> I<00:02:46.150> could

00:02:46.470 --> 00:02:46.480 
the actual hinge on so here yes I could

00:02:46.480 --> 00:02:47.670 
the actual hinge on so here yes I could
get<00:02:46.660> in<00:02:46.750> there<00:02:46.960> but<00:02:47.140> it<00:02:47.230> would<00:02:47.320> leave<00:02:47.470> it

00:02:47.670 --> 00:02:47.680 
get in there but it would leave it

00:02:47.680 --> 00:02:49.230 
get in there but it would leave it
really<00:02:48.010> really<00:02:48.190> awkward<00:02:48.340> for<00:02:48.790> me<00:02:48.820> I'll

00:02:49.230 --> 00:02:49.240 
really really awkward for me I'll

00:02:49.240 --> 00:02:51.210 
really really awkward for me I'll
actually<00:02:49.450> put<00:02:49.840> the<00:02:49.990> right<00:02:50.500> angle<00:02:50.800> adaptor

00:02:51.210 --> 00:02:51.220 
actually put the right angle adaptor

00:02:51.220 --> 00:02:52.830 
actually put the right angle adaptor
actually<00:02:51.670> on<00:02:51.790> there<00:02:52.030> bit<00:02:52.270> of<00:02:52.360> damp<00:02:52.570> pressure

00:02:52.830 --> 00:02:52.840 
actually on there bit of damp pressure

00:02:52.840 --> 00:02:57.150 
actually on there bit of damp pressure
actually<00:02:53.230> on<00:02:53.620> the<00:02:53.740> unit<00:02:54.040> itself<00:02:54.430> as<00:02:55.980> you<00:02:56.980> can

00:02:57.150 --> 00:02:57.160 
actually on the unit itself as you can

00:02:57.160 --> 00:02:58.530 
actually on the unit itself as you can
see<00:02:57.370> it's<00:02:57.610> actually<00:02:57.910> then<00:02:58.060> tightened<00:02:58.480> down

00:02:58.530 --> 00:02:58.540 
see it's actually then tightened down

00:02:58.540 --> 00:03:01.230 
see it's actually then tightened down
onto<00:02:58.990> the<00:02:59.110> surface<00:02:59.290> now<00:02:59.890> the<00:02:59.950> easy<00:03:00.400> reaches<00:03:01.000> to

00:03:01.230 --> 00:03:01.240 
onto the surface now the easy reaches to

00:03:01.240 --> 00:03:04.350 
onto the surface now the easy reaches to
to<00:03:01.690> get<00:03:02.050> into<00:03:02.250> awkward<00:03:03.250> areas<00:03:03.430> maybe<00:03:04.000> a<00:03:04.120> bit<00:03:04.270> of

00:03:04.350 --> 00:03:04.360 
to get into awkward areas maybe a bit of

00:03:04.360 --> 00:03:06.450 
to get into awkward areas maybe a bit of
wood<00:03:04.570> going<00:03:04.810> one<00:03:05.050> way<00:03:05.080> a<00:03:05.470> bit<00:03:06.010> going<00:03:06.190> another

00:03:06.450 --> 00:03:06.460 
wood going one way a bit going another

00:03:06.460 --> 00:03:09.180 
wood going one way a bit going another
and<00:03:06.790> you<00:03:07.120> need<00:03:07.300> to<00:03:07.420> get<00:03:07.600> into<00:03:07.780> the<00:03:08.530> corner<00:03:09.010> or

00:03:09.180 --> 00:03:09.190 
and you need to get into the corner or

00:03:09.190 --> 00:03:11.160 
and you need to get into the corner or
right<00:03:09.520> into<00:03:09.670> the<00:03:09.910> edge<00:03:10.150> of<00:03:10.420> the<00:03:10.570> actual<00:03:10.930> wood

00:03:11.160 --> 00:03:11.170 
right into the edge of the actual wood

00:03:11.170 --> 00:03:12.930 
right into the edge of the actual wood
that's<00:03:11.830> normally<00:03:12.160> quite<00:03:12.370> difficult<00:03:12.580> because

00:03:12.930 --> 00:03:12.940 
that's normally quite difficult because

00:03:12.940 --> 00:03:14.670 
that's normally quite difficult because
normally<00:03:13.300> the<00:03:13.480> body<00:03:13.750> of<00:03:13.960> the<00:03:14.080> unit<00:03:14.500> actually

00:03:14.670 --> 00:03:14.680 
normally the body of the unit actually

00:03:14.680 --> 00:03:16.350 
normally the body of the unit actually
gets<00:03:15.070> in<00:03:15.250> the<00:03:15.340> way<00:03:15.490> so<00:03:15.850> you<00:03:15.940> can't<00:03:16.210> actually

00:03:16.350 --> 00:03:16.360 
gets in the way so you can't actually

00:03:16.360 --> 00:03:18.090 
gets in the way so you can't actually
get<00:03:16.570> the<00:03:16.690> screw<00:03:16.930> in<00:03:17.050> or<00:03:17.200> you<00:03:17.590> have<00:03:17.680> to<00:03:17.800> come<00:03:17.980> in

00:03:18.090 --> 00:03:18.100 
get the screw in or you have to come in

00:03:18.100 --> 00:03:19.770 
get the screw in or you have to come in
at<00:03:18.220> some<00:03:18.400> awkward<00:03:18.760> angle<00:03:19.120> which<00:03:19.360> is<00:03:19.540> really

00:03:19.770 --> 00:03:19.780 
at some awkward angle which is really

00:03:19.780 --> 00:03:21.270 
at some awkward angle which is really
really<00:03:19.900> difficult<00:03:20.410> so<00:03:20.740> we<00:03:20.830> don't<00:03:20.980> want<00:03:21.130> that

00:03:21.270 --> 00:03:21.280 
really difficult so we don't want that

00:03:21.280 --> 00:03:23.070 
really difficult so we don't want that
so<00:03:21.550> what<00:03:21.700> we<00:03:21.790> do<00:03:21.970> nice<00:03:22.360> little<00:03:22.570> right<00:03:22.810> angle

00:03:23.070 --> 00:03:23.080 
so what we do nice little right angle

00:03:23.080 --> 00:03:24.870 
so what we do nice little right angle
bracket<00:03:23.200> and<00:03:23.620> you<00:03:24.070> can<00:03:24.220> see<00:03:24.430> straight<00:03:24.670> away

00:03:24.870 --> 00:03:24.880 
bracket and you can see straight away

00:03:24.880 --> 00:03:27.360 
bracket and you can see straight away
that<00:03:25.060> I<00:03:25.750> can<00:03:26.050> then<00:03:26.170> point<00:03:26.410> the<00:03:26.590> screw<00:03:26.830> in<00:03:27.010> and<00:03:27.250> I

00:03:27.360 --> 00:03:27.370 
that I can then point the screw in and I

00:03:27.370 --> 00:03:30.420 
that I can then point the screw in and I
get<00:03:27.640> an<00:03:27.730> easy<00:03:28.360> easy<00:03:28.570> reach<00:03:29.410> actually<00:03:30.160> into<00:03:30.400> the

00:03:30.420 --> 00:03:30.430 
get an easy easy reach actually into the

00:03:30.430 --> 00:03:33.210 
get an easy easy reach actually into the
unit<00:03:30.820> itself<00:03:31.440> anything<00:03:32.440> too<00:03:32.650> heavy<00:03:32.920> if<00:03:33.100> you're

00:03:33.210 --> 00:03:33.220 
unit itself anything too heavy if you're

00:03:33.220 --> 00:03:35.130 
unit itself anything too heavy if you're
doing<00:03:33.400> long<00:03:33.580> periods<00:03:33.940> of<00:03:34.000> word<00:03:34.210> is<00:03:34.570> just<00:03:35.050> going

00:03:35.130 --> 00:03:35.140 
doing long periods of word is just going
