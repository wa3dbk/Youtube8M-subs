there such a demand on the black market
for<00:03:28.390> human<00:03:29.390> hair<00:03:29.780> extensions<00:03:30.280> yes<00:03:31.310> about

00:03:32.259 --> 00:03:32.269 
for human hair extensions yes about

00:03:32.269 --> 00:03:36.009 
for human hair extensions yes about
several<00:03:32.690> situations<00:03:33.200> locally<00:03:34.070> where<00:03:35.019> hair

00:03:36.009 --> 00:03:36.019 
several situations locally where hair

00:03:36.019 --> 00:03:38.110 
several situations locally where hair
sellers<00:03:36.500> have<00:03:36.799> had<00:03:36.950> their<00:03:37.160> products<00:03:37.670> stolen

sellers have had their products stolen

00:03:38.120 --> 00:03:39.699 
sellers have had their products stolen
and<00:03:38.269> I<00:03:38.360> think<00:03:38.690> one<00:03:38.959> of<00:03:38.989> the<00:03:39.200> reasons<00:03:39.620> is

00:03:39.699 --> 00:03:39.709 
and I think one of the reasons is

00:03:39.709 --> 00:03:42.550 
and I think one of the reasons is
probably<00:03:40.190> because<00:03:40.579> this<00:03:41.390> hair<00:03:41.660> is<00:03:41.780> imported

00:03:42.550 --> 00:03:42.560 
probably because this hair is imported

00:03:42.560 --> 00:03:46.120 
probably because this hair is imported
from<00:03:42.590> India<00:03:43.250> and<00:03:43.760> it<00:03:44.030> takes<00:03:44.299> a<00:03:44.680> long<00:03:45.680> time<00:03:45.739> to

00:03:46.120 --> 00:03:46.130 
from India and it takes a long time to

00:03:46.130 --> 00:03:48.069 
from India and it takes a long time to
get<00:03:46.489> a<00:03:46.519> shipment<00:03:47.060> in<00:03:47.150> so<00:03:47.750> when<00:03:47.959> you're

00:03:48.069 --> 00:03:48.079 
get a shipment in so when you're

00:03:48.079 --> 00:03:49.830 
get a shipment in so when you're
servicing<00:03:48.470> so<00:03:48.890> many<00:03:49.340> people<00:03:49.670> in
