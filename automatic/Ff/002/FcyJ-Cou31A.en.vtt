00:00:11.920 --> 00:00:16.400
 knows her if someone at home 

00:00:14.600 --> 00:00:18.290
 somehow there is always a lie 

00:00:16.400 --> 00:00:20.330
 one left over gets a front point 

00:00:18.290 --> 00:00:24.050
 or pressure points luckner until she then 

00:00:20.330 --> 00:00:25.820
 It looks like that and you see it 

00:00:24.050 --> 00:00:26.990
 Actually, it's really common , too 

00:00:25.820 --> 00:00:28.369
 it's too bad for her 

00:00:26.990 --> 00:00:29.930
 to throw away is suddenly always 

00:00:28.369 --> 00:00:30.619
 they are longer then know 

00:00:29.930 --> 00:00:32.750
 World Champion 

00:00:30.619 --> 00:00:34.579
 but that is the end of the day for us 

00:00:32.750 --> 00:00:37.550
 turn this little one down 

00:00:34.579 --> 00:00:39.649
 but today a small cake and that 

00:00:37.550 --> 00:00:42.110
 be back within five minutes 

00:00:39.649 --> 00:00:45.940
 I even less in the microwave and 

00:00:42.110 --> 00:00:48.260
 yes I do not want to go on without fun 

00:00:45.940 --> 00:00:50.330
 Of course we need one first 

00:00:48.260 --> 00:00:53.780
 Banana and the skulls I now easy 

00:00:50.330 --> 00:00:56.180
 and then I take a third 

00:00:53.780 --> 00:00:58.220
 quarter about so has a little 

00:00:56.180 --> 00:01:00.200
 you see more and more and more away 

00:00:58.220 --> 00:01:02.180
 I just do that because I do that 

00:01:00.200 --> 00:01:03.440
 later still as decoration on the 

00:01:02.180 --> 00:01:04.939
 If we can not give you cake 

00:01:03.440 --> 00:01:07.549
 that, of course, also in the cake 

00:01:04.939 --> 00:01:10.130
 make and then I take the banana 

00:01:07.549 --> 00:01:12.200
 breaks into a bowl so stop 

00:01:10.130 --> 00:01:13.579
 somehow a microwave tight tube 

00:01:12.200 --> 00:01:15.159
 you need for it you can have a cup 

00:01:13.579 --> 00:01:17.179
 take or what he wanted there 

00:01:15.159 --> 00:01:18.740
 company a fork at hand and 

00:01:17.179 --> 00:01:22.689
 start crushing now 

00:01:18.740 --> 00:01:22.689
 until such a porridge arises 

00:01:31.930 --> 00:01:39.640
 next, I'll give you three tablespoons 

00:01:34.580 --> 00:01:39.640
 flour also bananas mush and the under 

00:01:49.509 --> 00:01:53.450
 Now I give two teaspoons of sugar 

00:01:51.710 --> 00:01:55.070
 of course you can also honey 

00:01:53.450 --> 00:01:56.060
 use if I prefer that then 

00:01:55.070 --> 00:01:57.590
 but maybe you should do it a bit 

00:01:56.060 --> 00:02:03.530
 Add flour because it is not so 

00:01:57.590 --> 00:02:05.179
 becomes liquid and now one 

00:02:03.530 --> 00:02:07.310
 other vessel because I'm something 

00:02:05.179 --> 00:02:09.380
 too small so used 

00:02:07.310 --> 00:02:11.030
 rather something bigger and you have then 

00:02:09.380 --> 00:02:13.370
 just a mess bring the stir 

00:02:11.030 --> 00:02:14.870
 and next is a bit more 

00:02:13.370 --> 00:02:15.799
 Baking soda that about a quarter 

00:02:14.870 --> 00:02:18.739
 teaspoon 

00:02:15.799 --> 00:02:20.420
 and some vanilla and there I have 

00:02:18.739 --> 00:02:22.780
 about a half to one 

00:02:20.420 --> 00:02:24.950
 teaspoon taken 

00:02:22.780 --> 00:02:27.140
 Now comes a little oil 

00:02:24.950 --> 00:02:28.880
 I have but just take something 

00:02:27.140 --> 00:02:31.069
 which is tasteless and one more 

00:02:28.880 --> 00:02:32.599
 tablespoon of milk and then reveals that 

00:02:31.069 --> 00:02:35.750
 whole easy and it comes in the 

00:02:32.599 --> 00:02:38.120
 microwave for two and a half minutes 

00:02:35.750 --> 00:02:41.269
 depending on how your microwave which 

00:02:38.120 --> 00:02:42.709
 power it has held and the consistency 

00:02:41.269 --> 00:02:44.900
 should be like me 

00:02:42.709 --> 00:02:47.150
 look and see us again soon 

00:02:44.900 --> 00:02:50.060
 and there is the delicious cake already 

00:02:47.150 --> 00:02:51.980
 took me two minutes 

00:02:50.060 --> 00:02:53.359
 about and you see when he's done 

00:02:51.980 --> 00:02:55.459
 So either could fork 

00:02:53.359 --> 00:02:57.609
 pierce or if it is so from the edge 

00:02:55.459 --> 00:03:00.109
 solve like that saw with me and 

00:02:57.609 --> 00:03:02.750
 I'm just cutting the banana 

00:03:00.109 --> 00:03:04.760
 which I had left on it 

00:03:02.750 --> 00:03:06.079
 and spread those there and then give 

00:03:04.760 --> 00:03:07.549
 a little honey about it I think so 

00:03:06.079 --> 00:03:09.079
 It tastes great, but you can 

00:03:07.549 --> 00:03:10.940
 Of course, such as nuts with, of course 

00:03:09.079 --> 00:03:12.709
 make it clean or so in the dough so 

00:03:10.940 --> 00:03:16.810
 walnuts or something is also delicious 

00:03:12.709 --> 00:03:16.810
 and yes then
