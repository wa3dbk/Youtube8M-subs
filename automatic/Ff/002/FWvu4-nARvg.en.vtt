easy<00:00:36.899> whether<00:00:37.469> using<00:00:37.680> on<00:00:37.860> the<00:00:37.950> bottom<00:00:38.219> lashes

00:00:38.360 --> 00:00:38.370

00:00:40.079 --> 00:00:42.139 
or the top lashes goes all the way
around<00:00:40.200> and<00:00:40.649> it's<00:00:41.129> almost<00:00:41.309> like<00:00:41.489> a<00:00:41.520> horizontal

00:00:42.139 --> 00:00:42.149
