consistent tonight and I really liked

00:03:16.780 --> 00:03:20.040 
consistent tonight and I really liked
that<00:03:16.900> line<00:03:17.170> when<00:03:17.800> you<00:03:17.950> have<00:03:18.100> a<00:03:18.810> past<00:03:19.810> couple

00:03:20.040 --> 00:03:20.050 
that line when you have a past couple

00:03:20.050 --> 00:03:22.710 
that line when you have a past couple
nights<00:03:20.200> we've<00:03:20.560> had<00:03:20.709> a<00:03:20.740> lead<00:03:21.300> they<00:03:22.300> just<00:03:22.480> grind

00:03:22.710 --> 00:03:22.720 
nights we've had a lead they just grind

00:03:22.720 --> 00:03:24.690 
nights we've had a lead they just grind
away<00:03:22.900> they<00:03:23.320> plan<00:03:23.590> to<00:03:23.709> eat<00:03:23.830> the<00:03:23.950> hash<00:03:24.130> marks<00:03:24.160> and

00:03:24.690 --> 00:03:24.700 
away they plan to eat the hash marks and

00:03:24.700 --> 00:03:26.460 
away they plan to eat the hash marks and
they<00:03:24.790> really<00:03:25.240> do<00:03:25.360> a<00:03:25.390> good<00:03:25.900> job<00:03:25.959> in<00:03:26.320> protecting

00:03:26.460 --> 00:03:26.470

they really do a good job in protecting
the<00:03:26.830> lead<00:03:27.480> so<00:03:28.480> that<00:03:28.810> I<00:03:28.840> thought<00:03:29.140> this<00:03:29.410> was

00:03:29.610 --> 00:03:29.620 
the lead so that I thought this was

00:03:29.620 --> 00:03:33.060 
the lead so that I thought this was

00:03:46.830 --> 00:03:46.840 
but he has been he's played at a

00:03:46.840 --> 00:03:48.360 
but he has been he's played at a
different<00:03:47.200> level<00:03:47.350> I<00:03:47.650> think<00:03:47.860> as<00:03:47.950> the<00:03:48.070> minutes

00:03:48.360 --> 00:03:48.370 
different level I think as the minutes

00:03:48.370 --> 00:03:51.240 
different level I think as the minutes
has<00:03:48.489> gone<00:03:48.519> his<00:03:48.940> way<00:03:49.150> and<00:03:49.450> he's<00:03:50.440> understood<00:03:51.040> how

00:03:51.240 --> 00:03:51.250 
has gone his way and he's understood how

00:03:51.250 --> 00:03:53.910 
has gone his way and he's understood how
hard<00:03:51.670> we<00:03:51.910> want<00:03:52.180> him<00:03:52.269> to<00:03:52.390> play<00:03:52.600> as<00:03:53.590> far<00:03:53.830> as

00:03:53.910 --> 00:03:53.920 
hard we want him to play as far as

00:03:53.920 --> 00:03:55.650 
hard we want him to play as far as
defending<00:03:54.400> because<00:03:54.760> he<00:03:54.880> does<00:03:55.030> have<00:03:55.060> offense

00:03:55.650 --> 00:03:55.660 
defending because he does have offense

00:03:55.660 --> 00:03:57.900 
defending because he does have offense
he<00:03:55.810> can<00:03:55.959> make<00:03:56.110> a<00:03:56.140> play<00:03:56.470> but<00:03:57.280> we<00:03:57.370> wanted<00:03:57.730> him<00:03:57.880> a

00:03:57.900 --> 00:03:57.910 
he can make a play but we wanted him a

00:03:57.910 --> 00:03:59.490 
he can make a play but we wanted him a
little<00:03:57.940> bit<00:03:58.180> stiffer<00:03:58.510> defensively<00:03:59.110> and<00:03:59.350> he's

00:03:59.490 --> 00:03:59.500 
little bit stiffer defensively and he's

00:03:59.500 --> 00:04:02.699 
little bit stiffer defensively and he's
certainly<00:03:59.920> done<00:04:00.130> that<00:04:00.190> for<00:04:00.640> us<00:04:00.760> and<00:04:01.709> protects

00:04:02.699 --> 00:04:02.709 
certainly done that for us and protects

00:04:02.709 --> 00:04:06.270 
certainly done that for us and protects
bucks<00:04:03.010> and<00:04:03.489> so<00:04:04.299> it's<00:04:04.750> been<00:04:04.959> a<00:04:05.070> because<00:04:06.070> I<00:04:06.160> don't

00:04:06.270 --> 00:04:06.280 
bucks and so it's been a because I don't

00:04:06.280 --> 00:04:07.289 
bucks and so it's been a because I don't
know<00:04:06.340> what<00:04:06.489> the<00:04:06.549> hell<00:04:06.640> it<00:04:06.670> was<00:04:06.790> what<00:04:07.060> we<00:04:07.120> got

00:04:07.289 --> 00:04:07.299 
know what the hell it was what we got

00:04:07.299 --> 00:04:09.900 
know what the hell it was what we got
and<00:04:08.010> when<00:04:09.010> I<00:04:09.040> first<00:04:09.220> saw<00:04:09.459> him<00:04:09.519> I<00:04:09.610> didn't<00:04:09.790> like

00:04:09.900 --> 00:04:09.910 
and when I first saw him I didn't like

00:04:09.910 --> 00:04:12.539 
and when I first saw him I didn't like
him<00:04:10.079> but<00:04:11.079> he<00:04:11.200> certainly<00:04:11.530> has<00:04:11.860> the<00:04:11.890> minutes<00:04:12.340> got

00:04:12.539 --> 00:04:12.549 
him but he certainly has the minutes got

00:04:12.549 --> 00:04:15.539 
him but he certainly has the minutes got
on<00:04:12.870> he<00:04:13.870> is<00:04:13.989> certainly<00:04:14.410> answered<00:04:14.890> and<00:04:15.310> raised

00:04:15.539 --> 00:04:15.549 
on he is certainly answered and raised

00:04:15.549 --> 00:04:17.729 
on he is certainly answered and raised
his<00:04:15.760> level<00:04:16.060> John<00:04:16.870> I<00:04:17.200> know<00:04:17.290> what<00:04:17.500> you<00:04:17.620> said

00:04:19.640 --> 00:04:19.650 
about december twenty third as far as

00:04:19.650 --> 00:04:21.900 
about december twenty third as far as
does<00:04:20.650> it<00:04:20.829> mean<00:04:21.040> anything

00:04:21.900 --> 00:04:21.910 
does it mean anything

00:04:21.910 --> 00:04:24.570 
does it mean anything
in<00:04:22.420> terms<00:04:22.630> of<00:04:22.810> Gabby<00:04:23.050> you<00:04:23.560> talk<00:04:23.950> you<00:04:24.400> have<00:04:24.550> a

00:04:24.570 --> 00:04:24.580 
in terms of Gabby you talk you have a

00:04:24.580 --> 00:04:26.820 
in terms of Gabby you talk you have a
goal<00:04:24.820> scoring<00:04:25.180> list<00:04:25.390> at<00:04:25.600> this<00:04:25.750> point<00:04:26.080> just<00:04:26.350> for

00:04:26.820 --> 00:04:26.830 
goal scoring list at this point just for

00:04:26.830 --> 00:04:29.970 
goal scoring list at this point just for
him<00:04:27.210> yeah<00:04:28.210> i<00:04:28.240> think<00:04:28.780> all<00:04:29.020> players<00:04:29.350> they<00:04:29.800> like

00:04:29.970 --> 00:04:29.980 
him yeah i think all players they like

00:04:29.980 --> 00:04:33.450 
him yeah i think all players they like
their<00:04:30.160> stats<00:04:30.780> Gabby's<00:04:31.780> had<00:04:31.990> a<00:04:32.020> good<00:04:33.010> third<00:04:33.340> of

00:04:33.450 --> 00:04:33.460 
their stats Gabby's had a good third of

00:04:33.460 --> 00:04:39.000 
their stats Gabby's had a good third of
the<00:04:33.610> season<00:04:34.020> but<00:04:35.020> again<00:04:37.410> there's<00:04:38.410> so<00:04:38.620> much<00:04:38.770> hot

00:04:39.000 --> 00:04:39.010 
the season but again there's so much hot

00:04:39.010 --> 00:04:43.740 
the season but again there's so much hot
can<00:04:39.160> be<00:04:39.340> played<00:04:39.580> and<00:04:40.500> I<00:04:41.500> think<00:04:42.370> he<00:04:42.550> is<00:04:42.750> he's

00:04:43.740 --> 00:04:43.750 
can be played and I think he is he's

00:04:43.750 --> 00:04:45.390 
can be played and I think he is he's
been<00:04:43.900> really<00:04:44.140> consistent<00:04:44.650> not<00:04:44.950> just<00:04:45.190> score

00:04:45.390 --> 00:04:45.400 
been really consistent not just score

00:04:45.400 --> 00:04:47.790 
been really consistent not just score
goals<00:04:45.640> but<00:04:45.820> other<00:04:45.940> parts<00:04:46.150> of<00:04:46.360> the<00:04:46.420> game<00:04:46.650> but<00:04:47.650> he

00:04:47.790 --> 00:04:47.800 
goals but other parts of the game but he

00:04:47.800 --> 00:04:51.000 
goals but other parts of the game but he
also<00:04:47.980> knows<00:04:48.400> that<00:04:49.380> it<00:04:50.380> doesn't<00:04:50.740> mean<00:04:50.830> a<00:04:50.860> whole

00:04:51.000 --> 00:04:51.010 
also knows that it doesn't mean a whole

00:04:51.010 --> 00:04:52.740 
also knows that it doesn't mean a whole
hell<00:04:51.190> of<00:04:51.220> a<00:04:51.340> lot<00:04:51.370> until<00:04:51.970> you<00:04:52.090> continue<00:04:52.570> doing

00:04:52.740 --> 00:04:52.750 
hell of a lot until you continue doing

00:04:52.750 --> 00:04:56.910 
hell of a lot until you continue doing
it<00:04:52.990> and<00:04:53.290> get<00:04:54.040> where<00:04:54.160> you<00:04:54.220> want<00:04:54.400> to<00:04:54.430> be<00:04:55.920> okay
