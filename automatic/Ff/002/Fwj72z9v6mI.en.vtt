00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.020
 hello sail friends games in this 

00:00:01.770 --> 00:00:07.440
 video I share two applications very 

00:00:04.020 --> 00:00:09.990
 useful for mobile android one 

00:00:07.440 --> 00:00:12.120
 time to have floating bubbles type 

00:00:09.990 --> 00:00:14.490
 facebook messenger but for our 

00:00:12.120 --> 00:00:17.850
 already well-known application of messages 

00:00:14.490 --> 00:00:19.980
 whatsapp application and the other is the 

00:00:17.850 --> 00:00:23.279
 best application for alarms 

00:00:19.980 --> 00:00:25.949
 stopwatch timer and things from what 

00:00:23.279 --> 00:00:29.699
 that with respect to time well the 

00:00:25.949 --> 00:00:32.040
 first it's called das town whatsapp and 

00:00:29.699 --> 00:00:35.550
 as I was telling you, it allows us to have 

00:00:32.040 --> 00:00:38.550
 floating bubbles when they reach us 

00:00:35.550 --> 00:00:41.010
 our whatsapp messages like the 

00:00:38.550 --> 00:00:43.500
 facebook messenger bubbles is very 

00:00:41.010 --> 00:00:46.350
 Easy to set up and activate only 

00:00:43.500 --> 00:00:48.420
 we have to in the application give 

00:00:46.350 --> 00:00:49.950
 select dan show whatsapp 

00:00:48.420 --> 00:00:51.719
 apply the application sent us 

00:00:49.950 --> 00:00:55.320
 directly for example here it seems to me 

00:00:51.719 --> 00:00:58.629
 which is deactivated I give in 

00:00:55.320 --> 00:00:59.829
 we activate giving this whatsapp and we are going to 

00:00:58.629 --> 00:01:01.840
 accept and ready 

00:00:59.829 --> 00:01:03.699
 we have activated what is the 

00:01:01.840 --> 00:01:06.100
 floating bubbles on our cell phone 

00:01:03.699 --> 00:01:08.770
 for example to the last of the application 

00:01:06.100 --> 00:01:11.290
 until down tells us try is to try and 

00:01:08.770 --> 00:01:13.570
 show to show what is how it 

00:01:11.290 --> 00:01:15.640
 They would see our messages and how they see here 

00:01:13.570 --> 00:01:18.220
 shows us and we can drag it and 

00:01:15.640 --> 00:01:20.080
 delete the message we can go back to 

00:01:18.220 --> 00:01:21.820
 put for example and we can drag it 

00:01:20.080 --> 00:01:23.619
 as I said as facebook type 

00:01:21.820 --> 00:01:26.500
 messenger but with messages from 

00:01:23.619 --> 00:01:28.390
 whatsapp is a very good application that 

00:01:26.500 --> 00:01:30.130
 it serves us well and so many who 

00:01:28.390 --> 00:01:32.710
 we are struck by the truth 

00:01:30.130 --> 00:01:36.950
 I liked it very well 

00:01:32.710 --> 00:01:40.850
 the second application is called handling 

00:01:36.950 --> 00:01:42.630
 and it is the best alarm application of the 

00:01:40.850 --> 00:01:44.990
 moment 

00:01:42.630 --> 00:01:48.210
 this also has a timer 

00:01:44.990 --> 00:01:50.100
 stopwatch and some other things here 

00:01:48.210 --> 00:01:52.280
 It shows us what time and 

00:01:50.100 --> 00:01:54.140
 time and date 

00:01:52.280 --> 00:01:57.740
 on the right hand it shows what it is 

00:01:54.140 --> 00:02:00.530
 the timer we can put 43 

00:01:57.740 --> 00:02:04.130
 minutes and the truth that it has an aspect 

00:02:00.530 --> 00:02:07.610
 very eye-catching and intuitive visual that 

00:02:04.130 --> 00:02:09.649
 allows you to configure what it is then 

00:02:07.610 --> 00:02:12.800
 yes what comes in the application more very 

00:02:09.649 --> 00:02:15.770
 easily and very fast here we can 

00:02:12.800 --> 00:02:17.330
 configure what are different 

00:02:15.770 --> 00:02:19.310
 alarms we select this we can 

00:02:17.330 --> 00:02:22.250
 delete and we can select to 

00:02:19.310 --> 00:02:24.130
 put another one over here if we remove one the 

00:02:22.250 --> 00:02:26.390
 we can undo then here 

00:02:24.130 --> 00:02:28.209
 we select what other alarms are 

00:02:26.390 --> 00:02:30.709
 here we can eliminate them quickly 

00:02:28.209 --> 00:02:33.709
 sending them to the right and then here 

00:02:30.709 --> 00:02:35.630
 we can look for some other 

00:02:33.709 --> 00:02:38.750
 alarm for example here we drag 

00:02:35.630 --> 00:02:41.810
 I want an alarm at nine because there are 9 

00:02:38.750 --> 00:02:43.670
 9 10 then here with this then we 

00:02:41.810 --> 00:02:46.489
 It makes it very easy to set an alarm 

00:02:43.670 --> 00:02:48.050
 we select and ready you keep it ready 

00:02:46.489 --> 00:02:49.670
 at the top and the alarm is 

00:02:48.050 --> 00:02:52.190
 put the we can configure and get 

00:02:49.670 --> 00:02:54.590
 put we can put different sounds 

00:02:52.190 --> 00:02:57.440
 for what is the alarm and the stopwatch 

00:02:54.590 --> 00:02:59.280
 timer serves us pretty enough 

00:02:57.440 --> 00:03:01.410
 good as well 

00:02:59.280 --> 00:03:04.260
 and then the truth is that it is a very good 

00:03:01.410 --> 00:03:07.500
 very good application the best application 

00:03:04.260 --> 00:03:10.290
 of alarms and time well then I hope 

00:03:07.500 --> 00:03:11.760
 that you like the two applications if 

00:03:10.290 --> 00:03:13.890
