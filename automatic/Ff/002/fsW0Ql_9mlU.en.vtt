00:00:03.040 --> 00:00:06.040
 Y 

00:00:09.150 --> 00:00:13.530
 both band has already released enkartur na 

00:00:11.730 --> 00:00:15.360
 me in the first card game free to 

00:00:13.530 --> 00:00:17.250
 play of the universe taken to 

00:00:15.360 --> 00:00:20.419
 web browsers devices 

00:00:17.250 --> 00:00:20.419
 smartphone and tablets 

00:00:20.870 --> 00:00:25.100
 the first time we play the first thing 

00:00:23.120 --> 00:00:26.780
 What we will be asked is that we choose one 

00:00:25.100 --> 00:00:28.730
 of the eight wrestlers in the 

00:00:26.780 --> 00:00:31.430
 available moment when dealing more 

00:00:28.730 --> 00:00:34.670
 exactly from load bowl yakuza and li 

00:00:31.430 --> 00:00:36.910
 ning and suckling pig and band having each 

00:00:34.670 --> 00:00:39.140
 one its own initial attributes 

00:00:36.910 --> 00:00:41.030
 In addition, it will also be delivered to us 

00:00:39.140 --> 00:00:42.830
 our first deck of cards which 

00:00:41.030 --> 00:00:44.780
 we can configure before each 

00:00:42.830 --> 00:00:46.760
 combat and always taking into account that 

00:00:44.780 --> 00:00:48.710
 although the game has more than 300 

00:00:46.760 --> 00:00:50.450
 letters that we can go collecting a 

00:00:48.710 --> 00:00:52.400
 It is only possible to jump into the ring with a 

00:00:50.450 --> 00:00:55.989
 maximum of 15 of them so 

00:00:52.400 --> 00:00:55.989
 we must choose wisely 

00:01:01.400 --> 00:01:05.120
 On the other hand, regarding the modalities 

00:01:03.260 --> 00:01:07.010
 of available games we will have two 

00:01:05.120 --> 00:01:08.990
 main options play in mode 

00:01:07.010 --> 00:01:11.180
 arcade where we will face rivals 

00:01:08.990 --> 00:01:12.770
 controlled by the cpu leter me a 

00:01:11.180 --> 00:01:14.600
 online combat to any other player 

00:01:12.770 --> 00:01:16.400
 of the world having also the 

00:01:14.600 --> 00:01:18.110
 possibility of being part of a 

00:01:16.400 --> 00:01:19.720
 online world championship in which 

00:01:18.110 --> 00:01:23.650
 we will compete in qualifying tournaments 

00:01:19.720 --> 00:01:23.650
 together with the rest of users 

00:01:32.360 --> 00:01:36.230
 as for the mechanics of the game a 

00:01:34.520 --> 00:01:37.940
 once the fight starts only 

00:01:36.230 --> 00:01:39.980
 We will have three actions to perform 

00:01:37.940 --> 00:01:41.720
 called focus strike and block 

00:01:39.980 --> 00:01:44.660
 fulfilling each of the following 

00:01:41.720 --> 00:01:46.610
 function if we press our spotlights 

00:01:44.660 --> 00:01:48.560
 character will concentrate and you can take out 

00:01:46.610 --> 00:01:50.270
 a new card from his deck being able 

00:01:48.560 --> 00:01:52.160
 get to accumulate up to five in total 

00:01:50.270 --> 00:01:53.960
 while doing focus will leave us 

00:01:52.160 --> 00:01:56.000
 completely unprotected if the 

00:01:53.960 --> 00:01:58.850
 adversary is about to attack us in that 

00:01:56.000 --> 00:02:00.710
 same turn on your part if we press the 

00:01:58.850 --> 00:02:02.420
 strike button will attack our rival 

00:02:00.710 --> 00:02:04.550
 with all the letters we have 

00:02:02.420 --> 00:02:06.140
 active having each letter a number 

00:02:04.550 --> 00:02:07.640
 which will indicate the amount of damage that 

00:02:06.140 --> 00:02:09.470
 provoke we will do although there is also 

00:02:07.640 --> 00:02:11.660
 some cards with features 

00:02:09.470 --> 00:02:15.400
 specials like making us recover and 

00:02:11.660 --> 00:02:15.400
 increase our defense and so on 

00:02:21.750 --> 00:02:25.800
 finally if we click on blog we can 

00:02:23.880 --> 00:02:27.720
 defend ourselves and thus block the attack of 

00:02:25.800 --> 00:02:29.790
 the proponents although you can only 

00:02:27.720 --> 00:02:31.860
 block a maximum of two of those letters 

00:02:29.790 --> 00:02:33.360
 so if it attacks us with three 

00:02:31.860 --> 00:02:35.400
 or more we will receive the damage 

00:02:33.360 --> 00:02:37.080
 corresponding to them what it does 

00:02:35.400 --> 00:02:38.760
 Whether it is a skill that although 

00:02:37.080 --> 00:02:41.250
 can save us on more than one occasion 

00:02:38.760 --> 00:02:43.520
 It's a bit risky to abuse 

00:02:41.250 --> 00:02:43.520
 she 

00:02:43.970 --> 00:02:48.290
 otherwise we tell you that as usual 

00:02:46.310 --> 00:02:50.060
 be habitual in this type of free games 

00:02:48.290 --> 00:02:52.430
 to play if we want to get more 

00:02:50.060 --> 00:02:54.590
 letters we should go buying the either 

00:02:52.430 --> 00:02:56.390
 with real money or with the credits that 

00:02:54.590 --> 00:02:59.570
 the game itself will give us a way of 

00:02:56.390 --> 00:03:01.250
 reward after each fight plus a 

00:02:59.570 --> 00:03:02.960
 curiosity is that when buying 

00:03:01.250 --> 00:03:05.570
 the letters we will have two possibilities 

00:03:02.960 --> 00:03:07.580
 go to a market of cards used in the 

00:03:05.570 --> 00:03:09.350
 that we can sell the letters that no longer 

00:03:07.580 --> 00:03:11.210
 we want at the same time we buy other 

00:03:09.350 --> 00:03:13.010
 new or go to a store where you 

00:03:11.210 --> 00:03:14.960
 acquire envelopes as if how to 

00:03:13.010 --> 00:03:17.060
 treat so we will never know what 

00:03:14.960 --> 00:03:19.190
 exact letters we will receive up 

00:03:17.060 --> 00:03:20.870
 we capture the top, always opening the 

00:03:19.190 --> 00:03:22.700
 possibility of obtaining in them if 

00:03:20.870 --> 00:03:25.430
 we are lucky some rare card and 

00:03:22.700 --> 00:03:27.350
 difficult to achieve in the same way is 

00:03:25.430 --> 00:03:29.540
 important to mention that if we have three 

00:03:27.350 --> 00:03:31.190
 repeated letters repeated we could opt 

00:03:29.540 --> 00:03:33.410
 by merging the and in this way 

00:03:31.190 --> 00:03:35.690
 we will have in exchange a new letter from a 

00:03:33.410 --> 00:03:37.760
 higher level also being provided that 

00:03:35.690 --> 00:03:39.470
 for this summer new envelopes are launched 

00:03:37.760 --> 00:03:42.140
 of letters that we can acquire in 

00:03:39.470 --> 00:03:44.030
 stores and scan using codes qr e 

00:03:42.140 --> 00:03:45.560
 even use in them the reality 

00:03:44.030 --> 00:03:50.080
 increased to make the characters 

00:03:45.560 --> 00:03:50.080
 of the game come alive in the real world 

00:03:54.580 --> 00:03:58.990
 In short, you enkartur namÃ©n is a 

00:03:57.130 --> 00:04:00.820
 game that can be especially 

00:03:58.990 --> 00:04:02.890
 funny to play it on our 

00:04:00.820 --> 00:04:04.840
 smartphone or tablet being available 

00:04:02.890 --> 00:04:07.000
 both for apple devices and 

00:04:04.840 --> 00:04:08.620
 android though we do not think against 

00:04:07.000 --> 00:04:10.660
 as interesting as game for 

00:04:08.620 --> 00:04:13.750
 web browser where the competition of 

00:04:10.660 --> 00:04:15.790
 this type of titles is greater in addition or 

00:04:13.750 --> 00:04:17.590
 mechanics we thought maybe too much 

00:04:15.790 --> 00:04:19.720
 simple compared to other games 

00:04:17.590 --> 00:04:21.340
 of more complex letters and what does 

00:04:19.720 --> 00:04:23.170
 indicated for those who come by 

00:04:21.340 --> 00:04:25.330
 first time to this genre but at the same 

00:04:23.170 --> 00:04:27.190
 time can disappoint users 

00:04:25.330 --> 00:04:30.000
 with more experience looking for a 

00:04:27.190 --> 00:04:30.000
 greater depth
