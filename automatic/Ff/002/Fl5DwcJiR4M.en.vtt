00:00:06.500 --> 00:00:11.099
 Tell us guys, we're here with one more. 

00:00:09.059 --> 00:00:13.980
 partner and in this video we will 

00:00:11.099 --> 00:00:16.650
 talk about the carlos guide pc is the 

00:00:13.980 --> 00:00:18.690
 number 142 we go to the pictures 

00:00:16.650 --> 00:00:20.580
 This is the first image we show 

00:00:18.690 --> 00:00:23.070
 all the cable forming that also 

00:00:20.580 --> 00:00:24.689
 all internal or face components 

00:00:23.070 --> 00:00:26.699
 already you can see that it does not 

00:00:24.689 --> 00:00:29.010
 Worried and straightening your hair, huh? 

00:00:26.699 --> 00:00:30.720
 indeed, the case does not provide the 

00:00:29.010 --> 00:00:33.329
 cable forming ideal 

00:00:30.720 --> 00:00:36.329
 the processor he is using is ff 

00:00:33.329 --> 00:00:38.879
 6 300 chilled with the peculiar of the color 

00:00:36.329 --> 00:00:40.980
 cearÃ¡ h-60 and a tip I give for 

00:00:38.879 --> 00:00:43.320
 it is put in the radiator of the ter 

00:00:40.980 --> 00:00:45.840
 in the place of this franc read and 

00:00:43.320 --> 00:00:47.969
 that is on the back of the 

00:00:45.840 --> 00:00:50.460
 cabinet and not the top part 

00:00:47.969 --> 00:00:53.370
 the board but the configuration is an asus n 

00:00:50.460 --> 00:00:55.500
 5 to 7 8 llx br 

00:00:53.370 --> 00:00:58.379
 the same one I'm using here from memory 

00:00:55.500 --> 00:01:02.420
 It has two dakson ddr3 fish each 

00:00:58.379 --> 00:01:05.309
 with 4 gb and clocked at 1333mhz 

00:01:02.420 --> 00:01:07.080
 on the part of the aggressors and their cabinet 

00:01:05.309 --> 00:01:09.570
 it does not provide the link format 

00:01:07.080 --> 00:01:12.540
 of drawer and in case it has 2gb hide 

00:01:09.570 --> 00:01:14.670
 500gb and another of 160 that probably 

00:01:12.540 --> 00:01:18.150
 must be from some of the old 

00:01:14.670 --> 00:01:20.340
 video card is a r 9,270 x of this 

00:01:18.150 --> 00:01:22.860
 track tech model steam x which is a 

00:01:20.340 --> 00:01:24.750
 classic situation of this crop itec 

00:01:22.860 --> 00:01:26.490
 video card is very good can not 

00:01:24.750 --> 00:01:28.890
 run all the team games boys 

00:01:26.490 --> 00:01:30.420
 grateful and with good fred rates 

00:01:28.890 --> 00:01:33.020
 so he has no problems with 

00:01:30.420 --> 00:01:36.150
 video card the source is a certain color 

00:01:33.020 --> 00:01:38.009
 600 watts very good source and is always 

00:01:36.150 --> 00:01:39.900
 appearing there on the channel you want to 

00:01:38.009 --> 00:01:42.299
 that it has good quality due to 

00:01:39.900 --> 00:01:45.030
 large number of people using this 

00:01:42.299 --> 00:01:47.280
 source for the cabinet that for me is the part 

00:01:45.030 --> 00:01:48.659
 that he should change the theme okay to see 

00:01:47.280 --> 00:01:50.700
 three black edition 

00:01:48.659 --> 00:01:52.829
 this cabinet is very old indeed already 

00:01:50.700 --> 00:01:53.490
 I had one and I traded it for Congress. 

00:01:52.829 --> 00:01:54.930
 xoom 

00:01:53.490 --> 00:01:57.180
 You will not be able to make a 

00:01:54.930 --> 00:01:58.950
 clean storage in this case because 

00:01:57.180 --> 00:02:00.750
 He does not have a ticket for us to pass the 

00:01:58.950 --> 00:02:02.250
 wires in the back 

00:02:00.750 --> 00:02:04.710
 You can even try with some 

00:02:02.250 --> 00:02:06.509
 cleats make a cleaner frame 

00:02:04.710 --> 00:02:09.000
 but still the cables will stay 

00:02:06.509 --> 00:02:11.330
 apparently this will not be the ideal so 

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:13.340
 who cares who they handle 

00:02:11.330 --> 00:02:15.050
 I do not recommend scribe though he 

00:02:13.340 --> 00:02:17.360
 have a good airflow 

00:02:15.050 --> 00:02:19.160
 This is another video here this week. 

00:02:17.360 --> 00:02:21.020
 You have registered and have hope 

00:02:19.160 --> 00:02:22.940
 I like it if you like, do not forget 

00:02:21.020 --> 00:02:25.780
 evaluate the video a hug to all 

00:02:22.940 --> 00:02:25.780
 titles went
