eighties or nineties whenever but it's
old<00:00:38.760> instead<00:00:39.690> of<00:00:39.809> the<00:00:39.870> new<00:00:40.020> one<00:00:40.050> made<00:00:40.440> by<00:00:40.649> the

00:00:40.700 --> 00:00:40.710 
old instead of the new one made by the

00:00:40.710 --> 00:00:43.670 
old instead of the new one made by the
junk<00:00:41.460> dealers<00:00:41.850> just<00:00:42.120> got<00:00:42.329> it<00:00:42.450> I'm<00:00:43.170> making<00:00:43.410> them

00:00:43.670 --> 00:00:43.680 
junk dealers just got it I'm making them

00:00:43.680 --> 00:00:45.619 
junk dealers just got it I'm making them
today<00:00:43.950> we<00:00:44.190> don't<00:00:44.370> give<00:00:44.579> a<00:00:44.610> hoot<00:00:44.820> about<00:00:44.969> how

00:00:45.619 --> 00:00:45.629 
today we don't give a hoot about how

00:00:45.629 --> 00:00:47.619 
today we don't give a hoot about how
good<00:00:45.899> it<00:00:46.050> works<00:00:46.200> and<00:00:46.469> how<00:00:46.500> long<00:00:46.800> it<00:00:46.950> lasts

00:00:47.619 --> 00:00:47.629 
good it works and how long it lasts

00:00:47.629 --> 00:00:50.720 
good it works and how long it lasts
that's<00:00:48.629> that's<00:00:49.079> probably<00:00:49.350> pretty<00:00:49.710> evident<00:00:50.039> so

00:00:50.720 --> 00:00:50.730 
that's that's probably pretty evident so

00:00:50.730 --> 00:00:52.750 
that's that's probably pretty evident so
I<00:00:50.760> would<00:00:51.510> go<00:00:51.660> with<00:00:51.780> booty<00:00:52.050> monsters

00:00:52.750 --> 00:00:52.760 
I would go with booty monsters

00:00:52.760 --> 00:00:54.650 
I would go with booty monsters
recommendation<00:00:53.760> that<00:00:53.879> you<00:00:53.940> probably

00:00:54.650 --> 00:00:54.660 
recommendation that you probably

00:00:54.660 --> 00:00:59.510 
recommendation that you probably
considered<00:00:55.350> the<00:00:55.469> serial<00:00:56.059> probably<00:00:57.059> a<00:00:58.520> much

00:00:59.510 --> 00:00:59.520 
considered the serial probably a much

00:00:59.520 --> 00:01:01.040 
considered the serial probably a much
better<00:00:59.870> durable

00:01:01.040 --> 00:01:01.050 
better durable

00:01:01.050 --> 00:01:04.490 
better durable
antenna<00:01:01.940> but<00:01:02.940> it's<00:01:03.120> a<00:01:03.359> probably<00:01:04.260> going<00:01:04.439> to

00:01:04.490 --> 00:01:04.500 
antenna but it's a probably going to

00:01:04.500 --> 00:01:06.230 
antenna but it's a probably going to
probably<00:01:05.250> going<00:01:05.400> to<00:01:05.460> work<00:01:05.580> just<00:01:05.790> about<00:01:05.909> as

00:01:06.230 --> 00:01:06.240 
probably going to work just about as

00:01:06.240 --> 00:01:08.690 
probably going to work just about as
good<00:01:06.270> I<00:01:06.720> mean<00:01:07.350> what<00:01:08.010> can<00:01:08.159> you<00:01:08.220> do<00:01:08.490> with<00:01:08.670> a

00:01:08.690 --> 00:01:08.700 
good I mean what can you do with a

00:01:08.700 --> 00:01:11.120 
good I mean what can you do with a
little<00:01:09.060> stainer<00:01:09.330> out<00:01:09.540> there<00:01:09.780> that's<00:01:10.130> 16

00:01:11.120 --> 00:01:11.130 
little stainer out there that's 16

00:01:11.130 --> 00:01:13.700 
little stainer out there that's 16
inches<00:01:11.400> long<00:01:11.670> and<00:01:12.000> a<00:01:12.360> cold<00:01:12.630> top<00:01:12.930> antenna<00:01:13.470> I

00:01:13.700 --> 00:01:13.710 
inches long and a cold top antenna I

00:01:13.710 --> 00:01:15.469 
inches long and a cold top antenna I
mean<00:01:14.189> how<00:01:14.549> much<00:01:14.700> difference<00:01:15.150> can<00:01:15.330> it<00:01:15.360> make

00:01:15.469 --> 00:01:15.479 
mean how much difference can it make

00:01:15.479 --> 00:01:17.660 
mean how much difference can it make
well<00:01:16.140> what<00:01:16.590> could<00:01:16.740> you<00:01:16.920> do<00:01:17.070> to<00:01:17.280> it<00:01:17.369> to<00:01:17.490> make<00:01:17.520> a

00:01:17.660 --> 00:01:17.670 
well what could you do to it to make a

00:01:17.670 --> 00:01:21.020 
well what could you do to it to make a
bigger<00:01:17.939> difference<00:01:18.409> so<00:01:19.409> I<00:01:19.439> went<00:01:20.159> oh<00:01:20.430> and<00:01:20.909> go

00:01:21.020 --> 00:01:21.030 
bigger difference so I went oh and go

00:01:21.030 --> 00:01:23.539 
bigger difference so I went oh and go
and<00:01:21.540> get<00:01:21.659> off<00:01:21.810> ended<00:01:22.200> all<00:01:22.350> that<00:01:22.680> it's<00:01:23.280> very

00:01:23.539 --> 00:01:23.549 
and get off ended all that it's very

00:01:23.549 --> 00:01:25.429 
and get off ended all that it's very
little<00:01:23.850> difference<00:01:24.210> in<00:01:24.360> the<00:01:24.420> two<00:01:25.020> of<00:01:25.229> them<00:01:25.380> if

00:01:25.429 --> 00:01:25.439 
little difference in the two of them if

00:01:25.439 --> 00:01:27.800 
little difference in the two of them if
if<00:01:25.860> this<00:01:26.100> one<00:01:26.280> was<00:01:26.430> perfect<00:01:26.850> and<00:01:26.970> the<00:01:27.390> cereal

00:01:27.800 --> 00:01:27.810 
if this one was perfect and the cereal

00:01:27.810 --> 00:01:29.300 
if this one was perfect and the cereal
was<00:01:27.900> perfect<00:01:28.350> would<00:01:28.740> be<00:01:28.770> very<00:01:29.130> little

00:01:29.300 --> 00:01:29.310 
was perfect would be very little

00:01:29.310 --> 00:01:31.460 
was perfect would be very little
different<00:01:29.840> okay<00:01:30.840> I'm<00:01:30.930> going<00:01:31.049> to<00:01:31.110> get<00:01:31.259> right<00:01:31.409> to

00:01:31.460 --> 00:01:31.470 
different okay I'm going to get right to

00:01:31.470 --> 00:01:32.120 
different okay I'm going to get right to
the<00:01:31.650> point

00:01:32.120 --> 00:01:32.130 
the point

00:01:32.130 --> 00:01:33.679 
the point
y'all<00:01:32.280> talked<00:01:32.549> about<00:01:32.820> water<00:01:33.119> getting<00:01:33.270> in

00:01:33.679 --> 00:01:33.689 
y'all talked about water getting in

00:01:33.689 --> 00:01:36.170 
y'all talked about water getting in
through<00:01:34.409> this<00:01:34.560> part<00:01:34.920> of<00:01:34.979> the<00:01:35.100> antenna<00:01:36.000> in

00:01:36.170 --> 00:01:36.180 
through this part of the antenna in

00:01:36.180 --> 00:01:39.050 
through this part of the antenna in
through<00:01:36.390> the<00:01:36.509> top<00:01:36.920> that's<00:01:37.920> possible<00:01:38.490> because

00:01:39.050 --> 00:01:39.060 
through the top that's possible because

00:01:39.060 --> 00:01:42.319 
through the top that's possible because
as<00:01:39.840> you<00:01:40.110> can<00:01:40.290> see<00:01:40.500> right<00:01:40.680> here<00:01:41.070> this<00:01:41.939> little

00:01:42.319 --> 00:01:42.329 
as you can see right here this little

00:01:42.329 --> 00:01:44.870 
as you can see right here this little
hole<00:01:42.479> is<00:01:42.689> where<00:01:42.869> the<00:01:42.990> Stinger<00:01:43.320> goes<00:01:43.590> in<00:01:43.880> up

00:01:44.870 --> 00:01:44.880 
hole is where the Stinger goes in up

00:01:44.880 --> 00:01:47.600 
hole is where the Stinger goes in up
there<00:01:45.149> and<00:01:45.420> this<00:01:46.170> got<00:01:46.470> two<00:01:46.740> little<00:01:46.950> set<00:01:47.220> screws

00:01:47.600 --> 00:01:47.610 
there and this got two little set screws

00:01:47.610 --> 00:01:51.260 
there and this got two little set screws
till<00:01:48.000> the<00:01:48.149> worm<00:01:48.590> screws<00:01:49.590> over<00:01:50.100> here<00:01:50.340> that

00:01:51.260 --> 00:01:51.270 
till the worm screws over here that

00:01:51.270 --> 00:01:53.440 
till the worm screws over here that
tighten<00:01:51.689> it<00:01:51.780> down<00:01:51.810> and<00:01:52.320> it<00:01:52.409> pushes<00:01:52.649> it<00:01:52.979> to<00:01:53.159> this

00:01:53.440 --> 00:01:53.450 
tighten it down and it pushes it to this

00:01:53.450 --> 00:01:56.300 
tighten it down and it pushes it to this
opposite<00:01:54.450> side<00:01:54.689> of<00:01:54.720> this<00:01:55.020> hole<00:01:55.259> and<00:01:56.040> you<00:01:56.189> knows

00:01:56.300 --> 00:01:56.310 
opposite side of this hole and you knows

00:01:56.310 --> 00:01:59.179 
opposite side of this hole and you knows
a<00:01:56.460> little<00:01:56.729> space<00:01:57.149> in<00:01:57.180> there<00:01:57.659> very<00:01:58.350> small<00:01:58.860> but

00:01:59.179 --> 00:01:59.189 
a little space in there very small but

00:01:59.189 --> 00:02:01.130 
a little space in there very small but
it's<00:01:59.340> a<00:01:59.399> little<00:01:59.610> space<00:01:59.880> and<00:02:00.450> water<00:02:00.719> could<00:02:00.899> sure

00:02:01.130 --> 00:02:01.140 
it's a little space and water could sure

00:02:01.140 --> 00:02:03.080 
it's a little space and water could sure
get<00:02:01.350> in<00:02:01.560> there<00:02:01.740> and<00:02:01.950> since<00:02:02.490> it's<00:02:02.729> pushed<00:02:02.969> to

00:02:03.080 --> 00:02:03.090 
get in there and since it's pushed to

00:02:03.090 --> 00:02:05.300 
get in there and since it's pushed to
one<00:02:03.119> side<00:02:03.299> it's<00:02:03.840> going<00:02:04.439> to<00:02:04.500> open<00:02:04.619> up<00:02:04.920> that<00:02:04.950> hole

00:02:05.300 --> 00:02:05.310 
one side it's going to open up that hole

00:02:05.310 --> 00:02:07.370 
one side it's going to open up that hole
even<00:02:05.549> more<00:02:05.909> than<00:02:06.390> what<00:02:06.630> if<00:02:06.750> it's<00:02:06.899> it<00:02:07.140> right

00:02:07.370 --> 00:02:07.380 
even more than what if it's it right

00:02:07.380 --> 00:02:10.580 
even more than what if it's it right
square<00:02:07.649> in<00:02:07.710> the<00:02:07.860> middle<00:02:08.569> okay<00:02:09.569> so<00:02:10.140> if<00:02:10.319> water

00:02:10.580 --> 00:02:10.590 
square in the middle okay so if water

00:02:10.590 --> 00:02:13.460 
square in the middle okay so if water
could<00:02:10.920> go<00:02:11.099> down<00:02:11.310> in<00:02:11.550> there<00:02:11.930> rain<00:02:12.930> comes<00:02:13.230> right

00:02:13.460 --> 00:02:13.470 
could go down in there rain comes right

00:02:13.470 --> 00:02:13.790 
could go down in there rain comes right
down

00:02:13.790 --> 00:02:13.800 
down

00:02:13.800 --> 00:02:15.950 
down
gets<00:02:14.010> on<00:02:14.190> on<00:02:14.730> the<00:02:14.940> stand<00:02:15.210> goes<00:02:15.540> right<00:02:15.780> now

00:02:15.950 --> 00:02:15.960 
gets on on the stand goes right now

00:02:15.960 --> 00:02:18.560 
gets on on the stand goes right now
through<00:02:16.590> that<00:02:16.650> hole<00:02:17.010> okay<00:02:18.000> let's<00:02:18.180> see<00:02:18.330> where's

00:02:18.560 --> 00:02:18.570 
through that hole okay let's see where's

00:02:18.570 --> 00:02:21.680 
through that hole okay let's see where's
gonna<00:02:18.840> go<00:02:19.580> it's<00:02:20.580> obvious<00:02:21.240> where<00:02:21.450> it's<00:02:21.570> gonna

00:02:21.680 --> 00:02:21.690 
gonna go it's obvious where it's gonna

00:02:21.690 --> 00:02:24.230 
gonna go it's obvious where it's gonna
go<00:02:21.990> I've<00:02:22.200> got<00:02:22.410> taken<00:02:23.130> apart<00:02:23.400> here<00:02:23.670> but<00:02:23.880> give<00:02:24.150> me

00:02:24.230 --> 00:02:24.240 
go I've got taken apart here but give me

00:02:24.240 --> 00:02:26.210 
go I've got taken apart here but give me
a<00:02:24.330> minute<00:02:24.510> it's<00:02:25.290> just<00:02:25.500> gonna<00:02:25.650> go<00:02:25.860> right<00:02:26.040> down

00:02:26.210 --> 00:02:26.220 
a minute it's just gonna go right down

00:02:26.220 --> 00:02:29.870 
a minute it's just gonna go right down
and<00:02:26.430> set<00:02:26.670> set<00:02:27.270> on<00:02:27.360> top<00:02:27.540> of<00:02:27.600> that<00:02:27.840> stud<00:02:28.880> right

00:02:29.870 --> 00:02:29.880 
and set set on top of that stud right

00:02:29.880 --> 00:02:31.520 
and set set on top of that stud right
there<00:02:29.940> that<00:02:30.510> little<00:02:30.690> stud<00:02:31.020> that's<00:02:31.350> the

00:02:31.520 --> 00:02:31.530 
there that little stud that's the

00:02:31.530 --> 00:02:34.310 
there that little stud that's the
threaded<00:02:31.980> stud<00:02:32.250> brings<00:02:33.210> the<00:02:33.360> curve<00:02:33.600> up<00:02:33.930> into

00:02:34.310 --> 00:02:34.320 
threaded stud brings the curve up into

00:02:34.320 --> 00:02:34.820 
threaded stud brings the curve up into
the<00:02:34.410> stinger

00:02:34.820 --> 00:02:34.830 
the stinger

00:02:34.830 --> 00:02:38.630 
the stinger
okay<00:02:35.730> now<00:02:36.690> the<00:02:36.780> only<00:02:36.900> problem<00:02:37.500> is<00:02:37.680> is<00:02:38.280> if<00:02:38.340> you

00:02:38.630 --> 00:02:38.640 
okay now the only problem is is if you

00:02:38.640 --> 00:02:41.150 
okay now the only problem is is if you
look<00:02:38.790> real<00:02:39.030> close<00:02:39.330> at<00:02:40.290> this<00:02:40.530> one<00:02:40.740> right<00:02:40.890> here<00:02:41.130> I

00:02:41.150 --> 00:02:41.160 
look real close at this one right here I

00:02:41.160 --> 00:02:43.910 
look real close at this one right here I
see<00:02:41.520> some<00:02:41.820> little<00:02:41.970> glue<00:02:42.590> remnants<00:02:43.590> of<00:02:43.680> glue

00:02:43.910 --> 00:02:43.920 
see some little glue remnants of glue

00:02:43.920 --> 00:02:47.090 
see some little glue remnants of glue
around<00:02:44.160> this<00:02:44.610> spot<00:02:45.600> here<00:02:46.020> around<00:02:46.470> the<00:02:46.650> threads

around this spot here around the threads
ma'am<00:02:47.670> that<00:02:48.000> may<00:02:48.150> have<00:02:48.270> been<00:02:48.390> their<00:02:48.570> effort<00:02:48.990> to

00:02:49.010 --> 00:02:49.020 
ma'am that may have been their effort to

00:02:49.020 --> 00:02:51.710 
ma'am that may have been their effort to
seal<00:02:49.410> this<00:02:49.980> area<00:02:50.400> off<00:02:50.580> and<00:02:50.880> keep<00:02:51.390> the<00:02:51.540> water

00:02:51.710 --> 00:02:51.720 
seal this area off and keep the water

00:02:51.720 --> 00:02:53.780 
seal this area off and keep the water
from<00:02:51.930> just<00:02:52.230> spiraling<00:02:53.010> around<00:02:53.190> the<00:02:53.520> grooves

00:02:53.780 --> 00:02:53.790 
from just spiraling around the grooves

00:02:53.790 --> 00:02:56.180 
from just spiraling around the grooves
in<00:02:53.970> the<00:02:54.150> threads<00:02:54.870> and<00:02:55.080> going<00:02:55.620> right<00:02:55.770> on<00:02:55.980> down

00:02:56.180 --> 00:02:56.190 
in the threads and going right on down

00:02:56.190 --> 00:02:59.330 
in the threads and going right on down
past<00:02:56.610> this<00:02:57.210> mounting<00:02:57.690> bracket<00:02:57.720> I<00:02:58.290> think<00:02:59.220> they

00:02:59.330 --> 00:02:59.340 
past this mounting bracket I think they

00:02:59.340 --> 00:03:00.260 
past this mounting bracket I think they
did<00:02:59.520> make<00:02:59.730> an<00:02:59.880> effort

00:03:00.260 --> 00:03:00.270 
did make an effort

00:03:00.270 --> 00:03:03.260 
did make an effort
the<00:03:00.720> glue<00:03:00.960> is<00:03:01.110> also<00:03:01.560> on<00:03:01.740> the<00:03:01.830> bottom<00:03:02.190> you<00:03:03.090> can

00:03:03.260 --> 00:03:03.270 
the glue is also on the bottom you can

00:03:03.270 --> 00:03:05.830 
the glue is also on the bottom you can
see<00:03:03.480> it<00:03:03.570> right<00:03:03.750> here<00:03:04.250> see<00:03:05.250> it<00:03:05.340> right<00:03:05.490> there

00:03:05.830 --> 00:03:05.840 
see it right here see it right there

00:03:05.840 --> 00:03:08.300 
see it right here see it right there
that's<00:03:06.840> what<00:03:07.170> they<00:03:07.320> seal<00:03:07.590> it<00:03:07.740> up<00:03:07.860> with<00:03:08.100> that's

00:03:08.300 --> 00:03:08.310 
that's what they seal it up with that's

00:03:08.310 --> 00:03:11.320 
that's what they seal it up with that's
the<00:03:08.460> glue<00:03:08.670> you<00:03:09.330> see<00:03:09.540> this<00:03:09.720> stuff<00:03:09.960> right<00:03:10.170> here

00:03:11.320 --> 00:03:11.330 
the glue you see this stuff right here

00:03:11.330 --> 00:03:14.420 
the glue you see this stuff right here
this<00:03:12.330> stuff<00:03:12.990> right<00:03:13.200> there<00:03:13.410> that's<00:03:13.980> probably

00:03:14.420 --> 00:03:14.430 
this stuff right there that's probably

00:03:14.430 --> 00:03:16.370 
this stuff right there that's probably
the<00:03:14.580> remnant<00:03:15.000> of<00:03:15.030> the<00:03:15.150> glue<00:03:15.390> on<00:03:15.630> this<00:03:16.080> side<00:03:16.350> of

00:03:16.370 --> 00:03:16.380 
the remnant of the glue on this side of

00:03:16.380 --> 00:03:18.920 
the remnant of the glue on this side of
the<00:03:16.620> cut<00:03:17.340> to<00:03:17.790> pieces<00:03:18.000> that<00:03:18.239> they<00:03:18.540> put<00:03:18.780> together

00:03:18.920 --> 00:03:18.930 
the cut to pieces that they put together

00:03:18.930 --> 00:03:21.140 
the cut to pieces that they put together
that<00:03:19.590> they<00:03:19.830> glue<00:03:20.100> they<00:03:20.280> glued<00:03:20.520> it<00:03:20.700> here<00:03:21.000> and

00:03:21.140 --> 00:03:21.150 
that they glue they glued it here and

00:03:21.150 --> 00:03:24.640 
that they glue they glued it here and
they<00:03:21.690> probably<00:03:22.020> and<00:03:22.290> they<00:03:22.620> glued<00:03:22.860> down<00:03:23.070> here

00:03:24.640 --> 00:03:24.650 
they probably and they glued down here

00:03:24.650 --> 00:03:27.949 
they probably and they glued down here
so<00:03:25.650> that's<00:03:25.920> probably<00:03:26.190> the<00:03:26.370> remnant<00:03:27.300> of<00:03:27.360> it<00:03:27.510> you

00:03:27.949 --> 00:03:27.959 
so that's probably the remnant of it you

00:03:27.959 --> 00:03:30.320 
so that's probably the remnant of it you
can<00:03:28.080> see<00:03:28.260> that<00:03:28.440> somebody<00:03:28.680> peel<00:03:29.459> this<00:03:29.670> back<00:03:30.000> off

00:03:30.320 --> 00:03:30.330 
can see that somebody peel this back off

00:03:30.330 --> 00:03:33.410 
can see that somebody peel this back off
of<00:03:30.900> this<00:03:31.050> hole<00:03:31.290> right<00:03:31.650> here<00:03:31.880> and<00:03:32.880> that<00:03:33.270> was

00:03:33.410 --> 00:03:33.420 
of this hole right here and that was

00:03:33.420 --> 00:03:35.690 
of this hole right here and that was
intended<00:03:33.959> to<00:03:33.989> drain<00:03:34.350> any<00:03:34.650> water<00:03:34.739> it<00:03:35.459> got

00:03:35.690 --> 00:03:35.700 
intended to drain any water it got

00:03:35.700 --> 00:03:38.750 
intended to drain any water it got
through<00:03:35.940> the<00:03:36.120> system<00:03:37.010> but<00:03:38.010> the<00:03:38.160> problem<00:03:38.580> with

00:03:38.750 --> 00:03:38.760 
through the system but the problem with

00:03:38.760 --> 00:03:40.370 
through the system but the problem with
this<00:03:38.880> whole<00:03:38.940> thing<00:03:39.360> is<00:03:39.510> if<00:03:39.690> you<00:03:39.810> got<00:03:39.959> water<00:03:40.260> in

00:03:40.370 --> 00:03:40.380 
this whole thing is if you got water in

00:03:40.380 --> 00:03:42.860 
this whole thing is if you got water in
here<00:03:40.830> it's<00:03:41.790> sitting<00:03:42.120> right<00:03:42.150> up<00:03:42.360> above<00:03:42.510> this

the<00:03:53.310> mouth<00:03:53.489> where<00:03:54.060> this<00:03:54.180> pin<00:03:54.420> goes<00:03:54.720> in<00:03:54.989> water

00:03:55.490 --> 00:03:55.500 
the mouth where this pin goes in water

00:03:55.500 --> 00:03:57.680 
the mouth where this pin goes in water
can<00:03:55.800> come<00:03:55.980> down<00:03:56.220> through<00:03:56.430> this<00:03:56.610> pin<00:03:56.970> around

00:03:57.680 --> 00:03:57.690 
can come down through this pin around

00:03:57.690 --> 00:03:59.870 
can come down through this pin around
this<00:03:57.930> pin<00:03:58.200> it'll<00:03:58.890> go<00:03:59.010> right<00:03:59.220> down<00:03:59.370> into<00:03:59.610> your

00:03:59.870 --> 00:03:59.880 
this pin it'll go right down into your

00:03:59.880 --> 00:04:03.100 
this pin it'll go right down into your
coax<00:04:00.300> that's<00:04:00.900> the<00:04:01.200> worst<00:04:01.380> case<00:04:01.680> scenario<00:04:02.220> oh

00:04:03.100 --> 00:04:03.110 
coax that's the worst case scenario oh

00:04:03.110 --> 00:04:05.930 
coax that's the worst case scenario oh
really<00:04:04.110> the<00:04:04.350> bad<00:04:04.560> part<00:04:04.890> is<00:04:05.010> if<00:04:05.489> this<00:04:05.700> thing

00:04:05.930 --> 00:04:05.940 
really the bad part is if this thing

00:04:05.940 --> 00:04:07.850 
really the bad part is if this thing
fills<00:04:06.180> up<00:04:06.390> with<00:04:06.420> water<00:04:06.570> gets<00:04:07.140> enough<00:04:07.410> water<00:04:07.680> in

00:04:07.850 --> 00:04:07.860 
fills up with water gets enough water in

fills up with water gets enough water in
there<00:04:08.040> too<00:04:08.520> short<00:04:08.850> then<00:04:09.360> you're<00:04:09.540> going<00:04:09.690> to<00:04:09.750> see

00:04:09.920 --> 00:04:09.930 
there too short then you're going to see

there too short then you're going to see
it<00:04:10.050> on<00:04:10.140> your<00:04:10.290> operation<00:04:10.950> of<00:04:11.550> your<00:04:11.790> radio<00:04:12.350> and

maybe 60 inches maybe four or five feet
five<00:05:57.060> feet<00:05:57.089> maybe<00:05:58.610> yeah<00:05:59.610> hi<00:06:00.389> I<00:06:00.990> just<00:06:01.649> couldn't

00:06:01.939 --> 00:06:01.949 
five feet maybe yeah hi I just couldn't

00:06:01.949 --> 00:06:05.629 
five feet maybe yeah hi I just couldn't
tell<00:06:02.069> any<00:06:02.310> difference<00:06:04.310> maybe<00:06:05.310> they<00:06:05.460> could

00:06:05.629 --> 00:06:05.639 
tell any difference maybe they could

00:06:05.639 --> 00:06:07.100 
tell any difference maybe they could
tell<00:06:05.819> some<00:06:06.029> difference<00:06:06.389> on<00:06:06.569> the<00:06:06.689> other<00:06:06.839> end

00:06:07.100 --> 00:06:07.110 
tell some difference on the other end

00:06:07.110 --> 00:06:11.059 
tell some difference on the other end
I'm<00:06:07.349> never<00:06:07.949> asking<00:06:08.189> buddy<00:06:09.710> but<00:06:10.710> I<00:06:10.740> couldn't

00:06:11.059 --> 00:06:11.069 
I'm never asking buddy but I couldn't

00:06:11.069 --> 00:06:13.219 
I'm never asking buddy but I couldn't
tell<00:06:11.159> any<00:06:11.399> difference<00:06:11.430> owner<00:06:11.939> on<00:06:12.449> receiving

00:06:13.219 --> 00:06:13.229 
tell any difference owner on receiving

00:06:13.229 --> 00:06:15.529 
tell any difference owner on receiving
so<00:06:13.830> I<00:06:13.860> understand<00:06:14.370> the<00:06:14.729> antenna<00:06:15.120> is<00:06:15.300> supposed

00:06:15.529 --> 00:06:15.539 
so I understand the antenna is supposed

00:06:15.539 --> 00:06:17.929 
so I understand the antenna is supposed
to<00:06:15.629> be<00:06:15.810> reciprocal<00:06:16.469> for<00:06:17.069> transmission<00:06:17.729> and

00:06:17.929 --> 00:06:17.939 
to be reciprocal for transmission and

00:06:17.939 --> 00:06:22.040 
to be reciprocal for transmission and
receive<00:06:18.270> so<00:06:18.629> if<00:06:19.289> I<00:06:19.439> saw<00:06:19.680> X<00:06:20.430> on<00:06:20.729> this<00:06:21.050> proceed

00:06:22.040 --> 00:06:22.050 
receive so if I saw X on this proceed

00:06:22.050 --> 00:06:24.529 
receive so if I saw X on this proceed
into<00:06:22.409> this<00:06:22.560> antenna<00:06:23.009> they<00:06:24.000> should<00:06:24.240> have<00:06:24.389> been

00:06:24.529 --> 00:06:24.539 
into this antenna they should have been

00:06:24.539 --> 00:06:27.170 
into this antenna they should have been
seeing<00:06:24.870> X<00:06:25.169> the<00:06:25.469> same<00:06:25.740> X<00:06:26.009> on<00:06:26.279> their<00:06:26.699> end<00:06:26.939> of<00:06:27.060> the

00:06:27.170 --> 00:06:27.180 
seeing X the same X on their end of the

00:06:27.180 --> 00:06:29.889 
seeing X the same X on their end of the
anti<00:06:27.569> or<00:06:28.020> else<00:06:28.199> that<00:06:28.379> is<00:06:29.129> theory

00:06:29.889 --> 00:06:29.899 
anti or else that is theory

00:06:29.899 --> 00:06:34.429 
anti or else that is theory
okay<00:06:31.669> that's<00:06:32.669> all<00:06:32.849> I<00:06:32.969> got<00:06:33.149> to<00:06:33.300> say<00:06:33.330> except<00:06:34.199> uh

00:06:34.429 --> 00:06:34.439 
okay that's all I got to say except uh

00:06:34.439 --> 00:06:37.459 
okay that's all I got to say except uh
good<00:06:35.430> luck<00:06:35.639> with<00:06:35.879> your<00:06:36.120> Wilson<00:06:36.569> if<00:06:37.139> you<00:06:37.259> got<00:06:37.440> a

00:06:37.459 --> 00:06:37.469 
good luck with your Wilson if you got a

00:06:37.469 --> 00:06:39.829 
good luck with your Wilson if you got a
notion<00:06:37.740> to<00:06:37.949> you<00:06:38.219> might<00:06:38.399> even<00:06:38.550> try<00:06:38.879> to<00:06:39.509> drill<00:06:39.810> a

00:06:39.829 --> 00:06:39.839 
notion to you might even try to drill a

00:06:39.839 --> 00:06:41.360 
notion to you might even try to drill a
little<00:06:40.110> hole<00:06:40.319> in<00:06:40.529> there<00:06:41.009> if<00:06:41.099> you

00:06:41.360 --> 00:06:41.370 
little hole in there if you

00:06:41.370 --> 00:06:43.850 
little hole in there if you
got<00:06:41.550> a<00:06:41.580> hole<00:06:41.820> in<00:06:42.060> there<00:06:42.240> at<00:06:43.020> that<00:06:43.260> spot<00:06:43.650> of

00:06:43.850 --> 00:06:43.860 
got a hole in there at that spot of

00:06:43.860 --> 00:06:45.110 
got a hole in there at that spot of
course<00:06:44.070> you<00:06:44.220> don't<00:06:44.400> want<00:06:44.460> to<00:06:44.639> drill<00:06:44.850> too<00:06:45.090> deep

00:06:45.110 --> 00:06:45.120 
course you don't want to drill too deep

00:06:45.120 --> 00:06:47.960 
course you don't want to drill too deep
in<00:06:45.960> there<00:06:46.139> and<00:06:46.290> go<00:06:46.410> up<00:06:46.620> into<00:06:46.860> something<00:06:47.820> that

00:06:47.960 --> 00:06:47.970 
in there and go up into something that

00:06:47.970 --> 00:06:50.240 
in there and go up into something that
matters<00:06:48.389> but<00:06:49.320> frankly<00:06:49.949> I<00:06:49.979> don't<00:06:50.130> think

00:06:50.240 --> 00:06:50.250 
matters but frankly I don't think

00:06:50.250 --> 00:06:54.560 
matters but frankly I don't think
there's<00:06:50.610> anything<00:06:50.910> down<00:06:51.690> that<00:06:51.750> low<00:06:53.300> down<00:06:54.300> that

00:06:54.560 --> 00:06:54.570 
there's anything down that low down that

00:06:54.570 --> 00:06:56.000 
there's anything down that low down that
low<00:06:54.780> I<00:06:54.960> don't<00:06:55.169> know<00:06:55.260> how<00:06:55.320> thick<00:06:55.590> that<00:06:55.770> it<00:06:55.919> is

00:06:56.000 --> 00:06:56.010 
low I don't know how thick that it is

00:06:56.010 --> 00:06:57.530 
low I don't know how thick that it is
but<00:06:56.280> I<00:06:56.340> don't<00:06:56.850> think<00:06:57.120> there's<00:06:57.300> anything

00:06:57.530 --> 00:06:57.540 
but I don't think there's anything

00:06:57.540 --> 00:06:59.600 
but I don't think there's anything
around<00:06:57.930> I<00:06:58.020> think<00:06:58.260> most<00:06:58.470> of<00:06:58.620> the<00:06:58.740> stuff<00:06:59.430> is

00:06:59.600 --> 00:06:59.610 
around I think most of the stuff is

00:06:59.610 --> 00:07:02.780 
around I think most of the stuff is
probably<00:07:00.000> up<00:07:00.180> around<00:07:00.479> this<00:07:01.290> area<00:07:01.770> up<00:07:01.979> in<00:07:02.460> here

00:07:02.780 --> 00:07:02.790 
probably up around this area up in here

00:07:02.790 --> 00:07:05.060 
probably up around this area up in here
because<00:07:03.780> the<00:07:04.050> coal<00:07:04.290> and<00:07:04.410> all<00:07:04.620> that<00:07:04.800> stuff

00:07:05.060 --> 00:07:05.070 
because the coal and all that stuff

00:07:05.070 --> 00:07:07.760 
because the coal and all that stuff
can't<00:07:05.310> go<00:07:05.430> down<00:07:05.610> too<00:07:05.850> far<00:07:06.110> here<00:07:07.110> so<00:07:07.500> y'all

00:07:07.760 --> 00:07:07.770 
can't go down too far here so y'all

00:07:07.770 --> 00:07:10.310 
can't go down too far here so y'all
might<00:07:07.949> be<00:07:08.100> alright<00:07:08.460> if<00:07:09.060> you<00:07:09.180> just<00:07:09.389> drill<00:07:10.139> your

00:07:10.310 --> 00:07:10.320 
might be alright if you just drill your

00:07:10.320 --> 00:07:13.280 
might be alright if you just drill your
little<00:07:10.560> hole<00:07:10.710> in<00:07:10.949> there<00:07:11.120> you<00:07:12.120> may<00:07:12.270> find<00:07:12.570> it<00:07:12.780> was

00:07:13.280 --> 00:07:13.290 
little hole in there you may find it was

00:07:13.290 --> 00:07:16.010 
little hole in there you may find it was
covered<00:07:13.650> up<00:07:13.889> by<00:07:14.070> this<00:07:14.130> thing<00:07:14.789> you<00:07:15.600> didn't<00:07:15.900> see

00:07:16.010 --> 00:07:16.020 
covered up by this thing you didn't see

00:07:16.020 --> 00:07:19.100 
covered up by this thing you didn't see
it<00:07:16.139> because<00:07:16.260> it's<00:07:16.620> covered<00:07:16.830> up<00:07:17.130> so<00:07:18.120> if<00:07:18.780> you<00:07:18.930> got

00:07:19.100 --> 00:07:19.110 
it because it's covered up so if you got

00:07:19.110 --> 00:07:21.140 
it because it's covered up so if you got
to<00:07:19.260> think<00:07:19.410> about<00:07:19.620> something<00:07:20.039> think<00:07:20.910> about

00:07:21.140 --> 00:07:21.150 
to think about something think about

00:07:21.150 --> 00:07:23.360 
to think about something think about
that<00:07:21.419> common<00:07:22.199> sense<00:07:22.410> goes<00:07:22.620> a<00:07:22.680> long<00:07:22.919> way<00:07:23.190> in

00:07:23.360 --> 00:07:23.370 
that common sense goes a long way in

00:07:23.370 --> 00:07:28.279 
that common sense goes a long way in
understanding<00:07:23.820> radio<00:07:24.860> common<00:07:25.860> sense<00:07:27.289> it's

00:07:28.279 --> 00:07:28.289 
understanding radio common sense it's

00:07:28.289 --> 00:07:31.300 
understanding radio common sense it's
really<00:07:28.590> good<00:07:28.770> for<00:07:29.039> you<00:07:29.389> consider<00:07:30.389> it<00:07:30.630> okay

00:07:31.300 --> 00:07:31.310 
really good for you consider it okay

00:07:31.310 --> 00:07:34.700 
really good for you consider it okay
I'll<00:07:32.310> take<00:07:32.520> care<00:07:32.760> of<00:07:32.820> this<00:07:32.970> so<00:07:33.210> grandpa<00:07:33.710> Corpus
