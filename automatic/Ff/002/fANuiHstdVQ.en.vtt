my<00:02:25.900> the<00:02:26.349> way<00:02:26.590> I<00:02:26.620> live<00:02:27.099> like<00:02:27.370> I<00:02:27.700> feel<00:02:28.510> at<00:02:28.900> least

00:02:29.069 --> 00:02:29.079 
my the way I live like I feel at least

00:02:29.079 --> 00:02:32.580 
my the way I live like I feel at least
and<00:02:30.090> I<00:02:31.090> I<00:02:31.150> don't<00:02:31.480> know<00:02:31.659> maybe<00:02:32.049> some<00:02:32.349> of<00:02:32.470> you

00:02:32.580 --> 00:02:32.590 
and I I don't know maybe some of you

00:02:32.590 --> 00:02:35.330 
and I I don't know maybe some of you
guys<00:02:32.799> can<00:02:33.069> feel<00:02:33.190> that<00:02:33.400> as<00:02:33.549> well<00:02:33.700> like<00:02:34.329> yeah

00:02:35.330 --> 00:02:35.340 
guys can feel that as well like yeah

00:02:35.340 --> 00:02:39.960 
guys can feel that as well like yeah
yeah<00:02:36.340> you<00:02:37.120> might<00:02:37.840> be<00:02:37.989> less<00:02:38.200> likely<00:02:38.640> you<00:02:39.640> you've

00:02:39.960 --> 00:02:39.970 
yeah you might be less likely you you've

00:02:39.970 --> 00:02:42.390 
yeah you might be less likely you you've
probably<00:02:40.480> refreshed<00:02:41.200> in<00:02:41.470> your<00:02:41.680> Facebook<00:02:42.220> page

00:02:42.390 --> 00:02:42.400 
probably refreshed in your Facebook page

00:02:42.400 --> 00:02:46.160 
probably refreshed in your Facebook page
a<00:02:42.700> couple<00:02:43.390> couple<00:02:43.750> -<00:02:44.079> too<00:02:44.439> many<00:02:44.709> times<00:02:45.099> and<00:02:45.400> III

00:02:46.160 --> 00:02:46.170 
a couple couple - too many times and III

00:02:46.170 --> 00:02:50.759 
a couple couple - too many times and III
I<00:02:47.170> gotta<00:02:47.620> admit<00:02:47.739> I<00:02:48.450> I<00:02:49.450> do<00:02:49.659> feel<00:02:49.989> that<00:02:50.019> that<00:02:50.560> way

00:02:50.759 --> 00:02:50.769 
I gotta admit I I do feel that that way

00:02:50.769 --> 00:02:54.839 
I gotta admit I I do feel that that way
so<00:02:50.829> I<00:02:51.430> I<00:02:52.209> should<00:02:52.569> probably<00:02:52.780> never<00:02:53.849> have

00:02:54.839 --> 00:02:54.849 
so I I should probably never have

00:02:54.849 --> 00:02:56.789 
so I I should probably never have
another<00:02:55.090> have<00:02:55.480> a<00:02:55.510> tab<00:02:55.840> with<00:02:56.079> Facebook<00:02:56.500> ever

00:02:56.789 --> 00:02:56.799 
another have a tab with Facebook ever

00:02:56.799 --> 00:02:59.460 
another have a tab with Facebook ever
again<00:02:57.159> after<00:02:57.430> this<00:02:57.930> that<00:02:58.930> could<00:02:59.049> be<00:02:59.139> my<00:02:59.290> goal

00:02:59.460 --> 00:02:59.470
