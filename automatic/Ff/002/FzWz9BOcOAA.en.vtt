00:00:04.820 --> 00:00:09.860
 We have five exercises to train 

00:00:07.910 --> 00:00:11.150
 We are the whole body mainly 

00:00:09.860 --> 00:00:12.680
 we train the legs and the 

00:00:11.150 --> 00:00:15.170
 but we also have body muscles 

00:00:12.680 --> 00:00:17.300
 many small muscles in the exercises 

00:00:15.170 --> 00:00:18.560
 inside it is not worth it separately 

00:00:17.300 --> 00:00:20.929
 to train but we pack 

00:00:18.560 --> 00:00:23.779
 honest complex movements or 

00:00:20.929 --> 00:00:25.279
 Let's start with a default step 

00:00:23.779 --> 00:00:27.500
 the weight will be in the front 

00:00:25.279 --> 00:00:30.080
 right hand it goes after the left leg 

00:00:27.500 --> 00:00:31.429
 front make default step while yes 

00:00:30.080 --> 00:00:33.680
 she never pushes her down 

00:00:31.429 --> 00:00:37.399
 the trade up is with tennis lee 

00:00:33.680 --> 00:00:38.989
 down and the weight should be exactly over 

00:00:37.399 --> 00:00:44.480
 the shoulder be rider brothers or 

00:00:38.989 --> 00:00:45.320
 straight up ten repetitions correctly 

00:00:44.480 --> 00:00:49.010
 from that 

00:00:45.320 --> 00:00:50.750
 these are 58 on the upwardly away from 

00:00:49.010 --> 00:00:54.109
 so if the body and addi hellwig 

00:00:50.750 --> 00:00:56.149
 have back from one will be opposite 

00:00:54.109 --> 00:00:58.750
 is used to breathing is okay too 

00:00:56.149 --> 00:00:58.750
 you continue 

00:00:59.019 --> 00:01:05.030
 okay we have the mat here now only 

00:01:03.050 --> 00:01:06.680
 a bit as easy help 

00:01:05.030 --> 00:01:08.780
 because we use the eh for the same 

00:01:06.680 --> 00:01:10.490
 Next exercise, therefore, we rise above it 

00:01:08.780 --> 00:01:15.560
 so that the distance really always 

00:01:10.490 --> 00:01:19.119
 this 90 degrees is in the case of the 

00:01:15.560 --> 00:01:21.860
 legs it is important jackson hole caves 

00:01:19.119 --> 00:01:26.000
 that the knee at the heel is okay the 

00:01:21.860 --> 00:01:33.200
 upper body on pretty well in the car in 

00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:35.720
 heppens okay, then great next 

00:01:33.200 --> 00:01:38.110
 never supported we do a bit 

00:01:35.720 --> 00:01:40.369
 easier on the knees 

00:01:38.110 --> 00:01:42.079
 we want that shoulders 

00:01:40.369 --> 00:01:43.729
 the picnic never a straight line 

00:01:42.079 --> 00:01:44.619
 So do not give in to the face 

00:01:43.729 --> 00:01:47.270
 push back 

00:01:44.619 --> 00:01:48.380
 yes the legs are the poor are more than 

00:01:47.270 --> 00:01:49.960
 shoulder strap apart 

00:01:48.380 --> 00:01:53.210
 The legs can stay together 

00:01:49.960 --> 00:02:01.509
 inhale down high with exactly 

00:01:53.210 --> 00:02:01.509
 100 body beautiful just great 

00:02:04.210 --> 00:02:08.569
 we will do four more pieces here too 

00:02:06.259 --> 00:02:10.520
 Ten repetitions of the head is one 

00:02:08.569 --> 00:02:12.050
 extension of the spine on breast 

00:02:10.520 --> 00:02:21.769
 If you pushed forward, let it go 

00:02:12.050 --> 00:02:23.690
 nice back sat from mexico okay now 

00:02:21.769 --> 00:02:26.420
 we had the oppressing chain after 

00:02:23.690 --> 00:02:29.620
 We have trained our legs now 

00:02:26.420 --> 00:02:29.620
 switch back to the legs 

00:02:30.880 --> 00:02:35.680
 the mat on the couch the back leg 

00:02:38.110 --> 00:02:43.430
 is now raised on the on the 

00:02:41.209 --> 00:02:45.230
 Matt on it the other foot jumps to 

00:02:43.430 --> 00:02:46.819
 a little further the eu promotes jumping 

00:02:45.230 --> 00:02:48.860
 so a bit forward and stays 

00:02:46.819 --> 00:02:50.930
 helps when apart upper body 

00:02:48.860 --> 00:02:52.580
 upright focuses on 

00:02:50.930 --> 00:02:54.140
 Balance it hard to keep up 

00:02:52.580 --> 00:02:56.989
 of balance and drive down 

00:02:54.140 --> 00:02:58.730
 with the hip and back up exactly that 

00:02:56.989 --> 00:03:01.069
 basin should want straight down 

00:02:58.730 --> 00:03:04.880
 lift not go forward but 

00:03:01.069 --> 00:03:07.940
 straight down and the weight distribution 

00:03:04.880 --> 00:03:09.530
 is 50 50 of those almost 50 when 

00:03:07.940 --> 00:03:14.209
 percent of weight when I'm in front 

00:03:09.530 --> 00:03:18.799
 and 50 back in this version nice 

00:03:14.209 --> 00:03:21.500
 form yes tries the upper body 

00:03:18.799 --> 00:03:23.299
 to keep upright if the 

00:03:21.500 --> 00:03:24.650
 upper body automatically tilts forward 

00:03:23.299 --> 00:03:26.660
 that means the hip flexor 

00:03:24.650 --> 00:03:29.019
 is shortened then you have the foot 

00:03:26.660 --> 00:03:34.400
 either a bit further down 

00:03:29.019 --> 00:03:36.350
 Place switch or he must 

00:03:34.400 --> 00:03:39.069
 could help citizens media over 

00:03:36.350 --> 00:03:42.069
 maybe not right yet 

00:03:39.069 --> 00:03:42.069
 Yes 

00:03:43.150 --> 00:03:47.200
 how can I intensify the exercise now 

00:03:44.890 --> 00:03:49.950
 you could do heavy weights 

00:03:47.200 --> 00:03:52.540
 take that would be a possibility 

00:03:49.950 --> 00:03:54.250
 you could put the foot in front one more 

00:03:52.540 --> 00:03:55.510
 make it unstable but that is 

00:03:54.250 --> 00:03:57.280
 not so useful because that 

00:03:55.510 --> 00:03:58.750
 probably not many people 

00:03:57.280 --> 00:04:00.489
 can be stabilized 

00:03:58.750 --> 00:04:15.900
 how can I make it easier for the 

00:04:00.489 --> 00:04:15.900
 Dumbbells put away tumor on the floor 

00:04:16.109 --> 00:04:22.000
 tells her man that her age including hull 

00:04:18.900 --> 00:04:24.280
 and that is now for the 

00:04:22.000 --> 00:04:25.590
 lateral abdominal muscles once on 

00:04:24.280 --> 00:04:27.910
 the page 

00:04:25.590 --> 00:04:29.289
 the legs are outstretched the 

00:04:27.910 --> 00:04:31.000
 shoulders looked up from here 

00:04:29.289 --> 00:04:33.340
 Shoulder basin for a straight line 

00:04:31.000 --> 00:04:36.190
 The arm below is 30 degrees from the upper body 

00:04:33.340 --> 00:04:38.530
 away then the upper arm goes 

00:04:36.190 --> 00:04:41.919
 stretched out and we push ourselves up 

00:04:38.530 --> 00:04:45.509
 her and the elbow goes to both 

00:04:41.919 --> 00:04:50.979
 So kneel both knees lift off the ground 

00:04:45.509 --> 00:04:52.210
 yes you have a bit too 

00:04:50.979 --> 00:04:54.220
 to know the balance because you are on 

00:04:52.210 --> 00:04:57.190
 namely only on the hip bone and 

00:04:54.220 --> 00:04:59.260
 try now the navel so 

00:04:57.190 --> 00:05:01.570
 far ahead time is turning you 

00:04:59.260 --> 00:05:03.419
 Please do not back that week 

00:05:01.570 --> 00:05:06.930
 but high pressure but as far as possible 

00:05:03.419 --> 00:05:06.930
 stay ahead 

00:05:15.630 --> 00:05:26.919
 good then the page changes immediately 

00:05:19.599 --> 00:05:30.300
 managed 18 times on both 

00:05:26.919 --> 00:05:30.300
 evenly trained sides yes 

00:05:30.620 --> 00:05:35.280
 one can also say to the legs 

00:05:32.760 --> 00:05:36.450
 try the knee because the legs 

00:05:35.280 --> 00:05:38.730
 that's great when you see her 

00:05:36.450 --> 00:05:40.490
 extends far away from the beautiful 

00:05:38.730 --> 00:05:44.310
 Bread beetle came 

00:05:40.490 --> 00:05:46.680
 because often done because it tries mold 

00:05:44.310 --> 00:05:48.300
 the legs or laziness if you 

00:05:46.680 --> 00:05:50.100
 that are just over 

00:05:48.300 --> 00:05:52.830
 the ground or even the ground 

00:05:50.100 --> 00:05:54.870
 touch your upper body when you drop 

00:05:52.830 --> 00:05:56.010
 the legs and in the air then here is 

00:05:54.870 --> 00:05:59.210
 the whole time the side 

00:05:56.010 --> 00:06:04.950
 abdominal muscles under tension 

00:05:59.210 --> 00:06:06.420
 okay okay then we stand up to that 

00:06:04.950 --> 00:06:06.870
 pulse up a bit more 

00:06:06.420 --> 00:06:09.900
 bring 

00:06:06.870 --> 00:06:12.600
 As a last exercise we do one now 

00:06:09.900 --> 00:06:14.550
 Squat cellphone is running nicely 

00:06:12.600 --> 00:06:17.300
 Dynamic for you, meaning more shoulder 

00:06:14.550 --> 00:06:21.390
 far apart scott down camels from 

00:06:17.300 --> 00:06:24.240
 lecker.de was very nice and the whole 

00:06:21.390 --> 00:06:26.400
 really fast makes your pace 

00:06:24.240 --> 00:06:28.710
 if he says that's enough for me the other day 

00:06:26.400 --> 00:06:30.900
 intensity then he does it right 

00:06:28.710 --> 00:06:32.790
 nice long draws in this last exercise 

00:06:30.900 --> 00:06:33.830
 The length until he said I'm real 

00:06:32.790 --> 00:06:36.480
 breathless 

00:06:33.830 --> 00:06:38.550
 he says human that is really a cellar 

00:06:36.480 --> 00:06:40.170
 makes that a bit slower 

00:06:38.550 --> 00:06:42.420
 but that knee lift at the end 

00:06:40.170 --> 00:06:44.360
 leave out and only the squat 

00:06:42.420 --> 00:06:47.940
 perform without lifting the knee 

00:06:44.360 --> 00:06:49.740
 this is the circle of five exercises you can do 

00:06:47.940 --> 00:06:52.110
 be quiet if you need between them 

00:06:49.740 --> 00:06:53.970
 Exercise break if the whole thing too 

00:06:52.110 --> 00:06:56.250
 is easy then he makes directly or 

00:06:53.970 --> 00:06:58.910
 circle behind without a break in between 

00:06:56.250 --> 00:06:58.910
 close
