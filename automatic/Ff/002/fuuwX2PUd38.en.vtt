00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.430
 so hello to all subscribers and guests 

00:00:02.639 --> 00:00:07.470
 channel today I want to show you the work 

00:00:05.430 --> 00:00:10.050
 small programs that can 

00:00:07.470 --> 00:00:13.259
 test hard drives for bad 

00:00:10.050 --> 00:00:17.100
 blocks and fix them to do repairs 

00:00:13.259 --> 00:00:19.770
 if these blocks can be overwritten by force 

00:00:17.100 --> 00:00:25.100
 replace from hard hard area 

00:00:19.770 --> 00:00:25.100
 drive here we run from the tower 

00:00:27.080 --> 00:00:34.050
 we choose Victoria 

00:00:29.539 --> 00:00:35.630
 The program of the Russian programmer is very 

00:00:34.050 --> 00:00:39.870
 successful 

00:00:35.630 --> 00:00:42.390
 thank him so much we choose 

00:00:39.870 --> 00:00:45.539
 program for laptops is an option for 

00:00:42.390 --> 00:00:48.989
 desktop laptop has built 

00:00:45.539 --> 00:00:51.780
 giving up to 100 mander all sorts and so in this 

00:00:48.989 --> 00:00:54.020
 programs need to read help or just 

00:00:51.780 --> 00:00:56.430
 memorize first is selected 

00:00:54.020 --> 00:00:59.760
 controller on which hard drive it 

00:00:56.430 --> 00:01:01.800
 you just need to find on some 

00:00:59.760 --> 00:01:05.339
 computers this is supposedly extra 

00:01:01.800 --> 00:01:07.250
 external controller but usually on 

00:01:05.339 --> 00:01:11.270
 primary master notebooks 

00:01:07.250 --> 00:01:14.159
 select it and f2 

00:01:11.270 --> 00:01:18.619
 We look that on this channel it is tough 

00:01:14.159 --> 00:01:21.330
 drive again button n is a choice 

00:01:18.619 --> 00:01:24.119
 the device on which is primary 

00:01:21.330 --> 00:01:25.950
 master and others on the left and so on channels 

00:01:24.119 --> 00:01:29.460
 on which the device can hang 

00:01:25.950 --> 00:01:32.720
 hard drives and after that in 2 button 

00:01:29.460 --> 00:01:32.720
 the description shows us 

00:01:33.810 --> 00:01:40.000
 characteristics even firmware and other 

00:01:37.390 --> 00:01:44.350
 the parameters of this device can also be 

00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:46.090
 learn smart button at 9 that's specifically in 

00:01:44.350 --> 00:01:48.250
 In this case, we see that with smart 

00:01:46.090 --> 00:01:51.369
 something is not okay unknown attribute 

00:01:48.250 --> 00:01:54.930
 unknown to try but shows very 

00:01:51.369 --> 00:01:59.200
 low parameters are much lower than normal 

00:01:54.930 --> 00:02:02.710
 further we can still begin 

00:01:59.200 --> 00:02:05.319
 scan push f 4 button here 

00:02:02.710 --> 00:02:08.289
 the final sector is starting 

00:02:05.319 --> 00:02:11.080
 initial sector I suggest you 

00:02:08.289 --> 00:02:16.450
 choose options here randomly and 

00:02:11.080 --> 00:02:19.120
 read butterfly read pi pi reading 

00:02:16.450 --> 00:02:21.850
 file check interface write tyrant 

00:02:19.120 --> 00:02:22.269
 from file linear reading is the easiest 

00:02:21.850 --> 00:02:24.700
 option 

00:02:22.269 --> 00:02:28.209
 stupid linear reading across the cluster on and 

00:02:24.700 --> 00:02:30.780
 fast enough but a defect in such 

00:02:28.209 --> 00:02:36.870
 mode detects not very reliably 

00:02:30.780 --> 00:02:36.870
 slips randomly and reading this 

00:02:37.079 --> 00:02:43.049
 heads 60 along the entire discs selectively 

00:02:40.360 --> 00:02:46.090
 read the cluster across the disk while 

00:02:43.049 --> 00:02:49.030
 very bmg strain mechanism 

00:02:46.090 --> 00:02:50.920
 drive and so on hard drive 

00:02:49.030 --> 00:02:52.420
 heats it up extreme in my 

00:02:50.920 --> 00:02:55.870
 for him mode of operation 

00:02:52.420 --> 00:02:58.030
 motor fla and here's the mode I donâ€™t know how he 

00:02:55.870 --> 00:03:00.790
 carried out but he is the most reliable 

00:02:58.030 --> 00:03:03.820
 way detective hard drives in a sense 

00:03:00.790 --> 00:03:04.269
 bad blocks with lush cluster on hard 

00:03:03.820 --> 00:03:07.750
 drive 

00:03:04.269 --> 00:03:10.000
 select it here and fix it 

00:03:07.750 --> 00:03:12.340
 you can ignore you just get 

00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:16.859
 information on slow read block 

00:03:12.340 --> 00:03:19.959
 or by bad block which availability 

00:03:16.859 --> 00:03:22.620
 flaw detector it can save 

00:03:19.959 --> 00:03:25.959
 vlogi cluster and names which 

00:03:22.620 --> 00:03:29.440
 damaged and here's the classic remap 

00:03:25.959 --> 00:03:31.540
 this mode in which the cluster is overwritten 

00:03:29.440 --> 00:03:34.480
 erased is something rewritten with 

00:03:31.540 --> 00:03:35.530
 it happens new happens remap then 

00:03:34.480 --> 00:03:38.790
 there is a fix 

00:03:35.530 --> 00:03:42.070
 sector advanced remap 

00:03:38.790 --> 00:03:43.569
 advise when the creator of the program and I tell you 

00:03:42.070 --> 00:03:46.749
 I advise in this mode 

00:03:43.569 --> 00:03:48.790
 much safer removed without the blocks well, 

00:03:46.749 --> 00:03:52.680
 and then you can press enter and run 

00:03:48.790 --> 00:03:55.799
 reading here's what happens when you run 

00:03:52.680 --> 00:03:59.950
 our hard drive is damaged 

00:03:55.799 --> 00:04:04.420
 went reading remap files failed not 

00:03:59.950 --> 00:04:06.730
 cluster files read went off 

00:04:04.420 --> 00:04:16.720
 went right here the cluster is displayed and 

00:04:06.730 --> 00:04:19.449
 which he corrects what's funny if 

00:04:16.720 --> 00:04:20.910
 bng block of magnetic heads damaged 

00:04:19.449 --> 00:04:26.520
 some kind of mechanic 

00:04:20.910 --> 00:04:30.520
 well, or let's say the chips are damaged 

00:04:26.520 --> 00:04:33.699
 firmware is something in electronics then we 

00:04:30.520 --> 00:04:37.210
 see the following picture press escape 

00:04:33.699 --> 00:04:41.490
 check stops press f4 

00:04:37.210 --> 00:04:45.310
 restart and run the check again 

00:04:41.490 --> 00:04:48.090
 We see a picture that is not very much 

00:04:45.310 --> 00:04:48.090
 has changed 

00:04:50.790 --> 00:04:57.810
 Well, it went much faster a little bit 

00:04:53.340 --> 00:04:59.550
 corrected supposedly but trust me if 

00:04:57.810 --> 00:05:00.210
 run the program restart 

00:04:59.550 --> 00:05:02.730
 computer 

00:05:00.210 --> 00:05:09.300
 would blocks at the same place in the same 

00:05:02.730 --> 00:05:10.380
 the amount of the third time run as 

00:05:09.300 --> 00:05:17.880
 you would see blocks 

00:05:10.380 --> 00:05:20.580
 even less here? indicates not faulty 

00:05:17.880 --> 00:05:22.440
 sector but suspicious which 

00:05:20.580 --> 00:05:24.680
 causes questions can not read it 

00:05:22.440 --> 00:05:26.070
 can't even determine his speed 

00:05:24.680 --> 00:05:28.070
 readings 

00:05:26.070 --> 00:05:30.990
 with skin access to this cluster 

00:05:28.070 --> 00:05:32.300
 perhaps it displays bad blocks already 

00:05:30.990 --> 00:05:39.050
 replaced 

00:05:32.300 --> 00:05:42.830
 from the backup area the entire hard disk 

00:05:39.050 --> 00:05:42.830
 freaked out by such 

00:05:45.350 --> 00:05:53.810
 try so wrong there and usually read 

00:05:54.680 --> 00:06:00.919
 linear 

00:05:56.930 --> 00:06:03.449
 Classic remap can be advanced 

00:06:00.919 --> 00:06:06.780
 as you can see the read speed in this mode 

00:06:03.449 --> 00:06:14.099
 much much higher but go blocks he 

00:06:06.780 --> 00:06:15.470
 no longer sees many went supposedly good 

00:06:14.099 --> 00:06:19.680
 zone 

00:06:15.470 --> 00:06:28.820
 trouble free butterfly mode here 

00:06:19.680 --> 00:06:31.650
 the blocks will be so f4 

00:06:28.820 --> 00:06:36.380
 There are more options if you have a hard drive 

00:06:31.650 --> 00:06:40.349
 there is no important information on it and there are chances 

00:06:36.380 --> 00:06:44.810
 restore it let's say write erase 

00:06:40.349 --> 00:06:44.810
 here these clusters rewrite 

00:06:50.200 --> 00:06:57.850
 interface check is very interesting what 

00:06:53.410 --> 00:07:00.940
 interface will happen okay that is 

00:06:57.850 --> 00:07:03.340
 here sata which is connected now 

00:07:00.940 --> 00:07:06.790
 hard drive now reads cache i'm so 

00:07:03.340 --> 00:07:10.320
 I understand the speed in this mode is high and 

00:07:06.790 --> 00:07:13.030
 no problems arise absolutely 

00:07:10.320 --> 00:07:16.030
 greens skip this quite everything in 

00:07:13.030 --> 00:07:18.490
 ok thanks for watching 

00:07:16.030 --> 00:07:21.210
 reviews subscribe to the betta channel 

00:07:18.490 --> 00:07:21.210
