00:00:01.960 --> 00:00:07.440
 good this video is to teach how 

00:00:04.630 --> 00:00:11.490
 change 

00:00:07.440 --> 00:00:15.010
 the joint for the driver the reason for the 

00:00:11.490 --> 00:00:19.480
 that we are changing this part 

00:00:15.010 --> 00:00:22.630
 because the old yoyo as you can see the 

00:00:19.480 --> 00:00:26.350
 Law ring 10 is totally out of 

00:00:22.630 --> 00:00:31.180
 your place now in this type of model 

00:00:26.350 --> 00:00:34.750
 which is a jaguar 2002 jaguar s-type with 

00:00:31.180 --> 00:00:37.930
 the 2.5 engine the reason for changing this 

00:00:34.750 --> 00:00:41.980
 piece is because 

00:00:37.930 --> 00:00:47.290
 the driver's side of the rear side is 

00:00:41.980 --> 00:00:51.060
 piece of here this to be contact with 

00:00:47.290 --> 00:00:53.860
 the law sensor 10 at the same time and 

00:00:51.060 --> 00:00:57.250
 works for the speedometer in this 

00:00:53.860 --> 00:01:00.010
 case the customer the speedometer stopped and 

00:00:57.250 --> 00:01:02.140
 That's where we started to review the 

00:01:00.010 --> 00:01:04.720
 car and we arrived at determination that 

00:01:02.140 --> 00:01:06.700
 these are the doors so bad the way 

00:01:04.720 --> 00:01:12.350
 to change it good as you can 

00:01:06.700 --> 00:01:14.420
 see forgiveness a little bit of not much light 

00:01:12.350 --> 00:01:17.200
 Well, we are saving a bit of 

00:01:14.420 --> 00:01:20.500
 work and this one kind of doing it a 

00:01:17.200 --> 00:01:22.780
 a short cut just taking away the 

00:01:20.500 --> 00:01:26.390
 east arm up here the only 

00:01:22.780 --> 00:01:29.659
 strict term here the caliper 

00:01:26.390 --> 00:01:31.980
 and the center nut so soon 

00:01:29.659 --> 00:01:36.240
 we remove all that 

00:01:31.980 --> 00:01:39.230
 we voted the boot the boot in this case 

00:01:36.240 --> 00:01:42.320
 this is the new boot 

00:01:39.230 --> 00:01:44.409
 but all we do is we throw the 

00:01:42.320 --> 00:01:48.789
 old boot 

00:01:44.409 --> 00:01:51.880
 back from the same year and what 

00:01:48.789 --> 00:01:54.850
 we can do is remove it backwards 

00:01:51.880 --> 00:01:57.250
 in this position that way we leave 

00:01:54.850 --> 00:02:00.579
 exposed here and what we do is 

00:01:57.250 --> 00:02:03.670
 We hold with a few vice or colds 

00:02:00.579 --> 00:02:07.060
 of pressure we hit back it bounces 

00:02:03.670 --> 00:02:12.030
 and that already gives us space to take out the 

00:02:07.060 --> 00:02:14.370
 jogging from here in this position 

00:02:12.030 --> 00:02:17.549
 it does not go wrong 

00:02:14.370 --> 00:02:20.280
 I hope this video is useful 

00:02:17.549 --> 00:02:23.700
 for other people usually all 

00:02:20.280 --> 00:02:26.670
 these cars the jaguars state of 2002 

00:02:23.700 --> 00:02:29.720
 to 2007 they had this problem and this is 

00:02:26.670 --> 00:02:29.720
 the problem with ours 

00:02:30.160 --> 00:02:36.420
 let's now put everything in reverse and 

00:02:33.010 --> 00:02:36.420
 we'll see how they work
