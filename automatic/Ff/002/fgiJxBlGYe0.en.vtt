the<00:00:30.269> Irwin<00:00:30.630> adjustable<00:00:31.289> again<00:00:32.219> I've<00:00:32.369> never

00:00:32.389 --> 00:00:32.399 
the Irwin adjustable again I've never

00:00:32.399 --> 00:00:34.209 
the Irwin adjustable again I've never
used<00:00:32.790> this<00:00:32.969> one<00:00:33.180> before<00:00:33.329> but<00:00:33.660> it<00:00:33.750> looks<00:00:33.960> like

00:00:34.209 --> 00:00:34.219 
used this one before but it looks like

00:00:34.219 --> 00:00:37.670 
used this one before but it looks like
you<00:00:35.219> can<00:00:35.370> go<00:00:35.520> from<00:00:35.899> 3/4<00:00:36.899> of<00:00:36.930> an<00:00:37.140> inch

00:00:37.670 --> 00:00:37.680 
you can go from 3/4 of an inch

00:00:37.680 --> 00:00:40.970 
you can go from 3/4 of an inch
clear<00:00:38.670> up<00:00:38.879> looks<00:00:39.840> like<00:00:39.960> maybe<00:00:40.170> even<00:00:40.290> up<00:00:40.620> to<00:00:40.739> two

00:00:40.970 --> 00:00:40.980 
clear up looks like maybe even up to two

00:00:40.980 --> 00:00:43.130 
clear up looks like maybe even up to two
inch<00:00:41.219> let's<00:00:41.910> just<00:00:42.090> start<00:00:42.270> with<00:00:42.450> the<00:00:42.540> basic<00:00:42.960> bit

00:00:43.130 --> 00:00:43.140 
inch let's just start with the basic bit

00:00:43.140 --> 00:00:46.220 
inch let's just start with the basic bit
here<00:00:43.379> so<00:00:44.160> we'll<00:00:44.910> chuck<00:00:45.210> this<00:00:45.390> up<00:00:45.570> I'll<00:00:45.719> use<00:00:45.960> the

00:00:46.220 --> 00:00:46.230 
here so we'll chuck this up I'll use the

00:00:46.230 --> 00:00:54.709 
here so we'll chuck this up I'll use the
ratcheting<00:00:47.930> brace<00:00:52.820> these<00:00:53.820> braces<00:00:54.329> you<00:00:54.449> change

00:00:54.709 --> 00:00:54.719 
ratcheting brace these braces you change

00:00:54.719 --> 00:00:56.330 
ratcheting brace these braces you change
the<00:00:54.930> section<00:00:55.170> or<00:00:55.469> change<00:00:55.770> the<00:00:55.920> way<00:00:56.070> that<00:00:56.280> it

00:00:56.330 --> 00:00:56.340 
the section or change the way that it

00:00:56.340 --> 00:00:59.500 
the section or change the way that it
ratchets<00:00:56.489> right<00:00:56.940> here<00:00:57.120> on<00:00:57.210> this<00:00:57.300> dial<00:00:57.800> so<00:00:58.800> in

00:00:59.500 --> 00:00:59.510 
ratchets right here on this dial so in

00:00:59.510 --> 00:01:02.930 
ratchets right here on this dial so in
and<00:01:00.510> out<00:01:00.780> just<00:01:01.320> like<00:01:01.469> that<00:01:01.710> we'll<00:01:02.520> start<00:01:02.789> with

00:01:02.930 --> 00:01:02.940 
and out just like that we'll start with

00:01:02.940 --> 00:01:07.910 
and out just like that we'll start with
a<00:01:02.969> one-inch<00:01:03.390> standard<00:01:03.870> bit<00:01:05.090> on<00:01:06.090> your<00:01:06.299> mark<00:01:06.920> get

00:01:07.910 --> 00:01:07.920 
a one-inch standard bit on your mark get

00:01:07.920 --> 00:01:36.620 
a one-inch standard bit on your mark get
set<00:01:07.979> go

00:01:36.620 --> 00:01:36.630 

00:01:36.630 --> 00:01:41.220 

there<00:01:37.630> you<00:01:37.870> can<00:01:37.990> fill<00:01:38.170> it<00:01:38.290> through<00:01:40.020> so<00:01:41.020> if<00:01:41.110> we

00:01:41.220 --> 00:01:41.230 
there you can fill it through so if we

00:01:41.230 --> 00:01:48.500 
there you can fill it through so if we
flip<00:01:41.470> it<00:01:41.500> over<00:01:41.680> here<00:01:45.450> we'll<00:01:46.450> see<00:01:46.780> that<00:01:46.960> we<00:01:47.170> are

00:01:48.500 --> 00:01:48.510 
flip it over here we'll see that we are

00:01:48.510 --> 00:01:51.030 
flip it over here we'll see that we are
indeed<00:01:49.510> through<00:01:49.990> we'll<00:01:50.470> just<00:01:50.680> stop<00:01:50.860> them

00:01:51.030 --> 00:01:51.040 
indeed through we'll just stop them

00:01:51.040 --> 00:01:53.160 
indeed through we'll just stop them
right<00:01:51.220> there<00:01:51.460> so<00:01:52.210> we<00:01:52.300> can<00:01:52.479> see<00:01:52.660> that<00:01:52.840> the<00:01:52.960> hole

00:01:53.160 --> 00:01:53.170 
right there so we can see that the hole

00:01:53.170 --> 00:01:55.910 
right there so we can see that the hole
is<00:01:53.760> very<00:01:54.760> clean

00:01:55.910 --> 00:01:55.920 
is very clean

00:01:55.920 --> 00:02:01.040 
is very clean
super<00:01:56.920> precise<00:01:57.690> no<00:01:58.690> tear<00:01:58.990> out<00:01:59.200> there<00:01:59.470> at<00:01:59.590> all<00:01:59.740> a

00:02:01.040 --> 00:02:01.050 
super precise no tear out there at all a

00:02:01.050 --> 00:02:05.749 
super precise no tear out there at all a
really<00:02:02.050> nice<00:02:02.290> clean<00:02:03.960> one-inch<00:02:04.960> hole

00:02:05.749 --> 00:02:05.759 
really nice clean one-inch hole

00:02:05.759 --> 00:02:09.630 
really nice clean one-inch hole
so<00:02:06.759> now<00:02:06.970> we'll<00:02:07.180> check<00:02:07.450> up<00:02:07.660> the<00:02:07.930> the<00:02:08.679> Irwin<00:02:09.100> 21

00:02:09.630 --> 00:02:09.640 
so now we'll check up the the Irwin 21

00:02:09.640 --> 00:02:14.640 
so now we'll check up the the Irwin 21
the<00:02:09.759> adjustable<00:02:10.330> on<00:02:10.650> the<00:02:11.650> same<00:02:11.860> brace<00:02:13.650> so

00:02:14.640 --> 00:02:14.650 
the adjustable on the same brace so

00:02:14.650 --> 00:02:17.190 
the adjustable on the same brace so
having<00:02:14.890> never<00:02:15.100> used<00:02:15.400> one<00:02:15.550> of<00:02:15.670> these<00:02:15.790> I<00:02:16.240> don't

00:02:17.190 --> 00:02:17.200 
having never used one of these I don't

00:02:17.200 --> 00:02:18.840 
having never used one of these I don't
know<00:02:17.560> exactly<00:02:17.680> what<00:02:18.100> to<00:02:18.130> expect<00:02:18.580> but<00:02:18.670> I<00:02:18.730> do

00:02:21.090 --> 00:02:21.100 
kind of expect it to not work as well

00:02:21.100 --> 00:02:22.020 
kind of expect it to not work as well
you<00:02:21.310> know<00:02:21.400> whatever<00:02:21.610> you<00:02:21.700> get<00:02:21.820> these

00:03:21.260 --> 00:03:23.170 
effort not a great deal but not quite as
smooth<00:03:21.560> but<00:03:22.010> I<00:03:22.250> wouldn't<00:03:22.490> say<00:03:22.670> it<00:03:22.790> was<00:03:22.940> I

00:03:23.170 --> 00:03:23.180 
smooth but I wouldn't say it was I

00:03:23.180 --> 00:03:25.600 
smooth but I wouldn't say it was I
wouldn't<00:03:23.959> say<00:03:24.050> it<00:03:24.110> was<00:03:24.140> bad<00:03:24.470> at<00:03:24.800> all<00:03:24.920> actually

00:03:25.600 --> 00:03:25.610 
wouldn't say it was bad at all actually

00:03:25.610 --> 00:03:29.890 
wouldn't say it was bad at all actually
it<00:03:25.910> was<00:03:26.590> it<00:03:27.590> was<00:03:27.740> quite<00:03:28.040> good<00:03:28.070> there<00:03:28.670> so<00:03:29.420> we

00:03:29.890 --> 00:03:29.900 
it was it was quite good there so we

00:03:29.900 --> 00:03:33.190 
it was it was quite good there so we
flipped<00:03:30.140> it<00:03:30.200> over<00:03:30.350> here<00:03:30.709> you<00:03:31.060> can<00:03:32.060> see<00:03:32.300> that<00:03:32.540> we

00:03:33.190 --> 00:03:33.200 
flipped it over here you can see that we

00:03:33.200 --> 00:03:35.470 
flipped it over here you can see that we
did<00:03:33.640> indeed<00:03:34.640> come<00:03:34.910> through<00:03:35.150> there's<00:03:35.360> our

00:03:35.470 --> 00:03:35.480 
did indeed come through there's our

00:03:35.480 --> 00:03:42.910 
did indeed come through there's our
first<00:03:35.750> hole<00:03:40.750> it's<00:03:41.750> pretty<00:03:41.990> clean<00:03:42.290> I<00:03:42.590> was

00:03:42.910 --> 00:03:42.920 
first hole it's pretty clean I was

00:03:42.920 --> 00:03:44.500 
first hole it's pretty clean I was
expecting<00:03:43.430> to<00:03:43.490> have<00:03:43.700> a<00:03:43.730> little<00:03:44.030> bit<00:03:44.150> of<00:03:44.180> tear

00:03:44.500 --> 00:03:44.510 
expecting to have a little bit of tear

00:03:44.510 --> 00:03:48.550 
expecting to have a little bit of tear
out<00:03:44.690> there<00:03:45.310> kind<00:03:46.310> of<00:03:46.430> a<00:03:46.519> ragged<00:03:46.880> edge<00:03:47.470> but<00:03:48.470> I

00:03:48.550 --> 00:03:48.560 
out there kind of a ragged edge but I

00:03:48.560 --> 00:03:51.460 
out there kind of a ragged edge but I
really<00:03:48.890> can't<00:03:49.070> see<00:03:49.370> much<00:03:49.580> difference<00:03:50.150> is<00:03:50.470> what

00:03:51.460 --> 00:03:51.470 
really can't see much difference is what

00:03:51.470 --> 00:03:53.470 
really can't see much difference is what
it<00:03:51.590> is<00:03:51.739> there<00:03:52.100> you're<00:03:52.670> looking<00:03:52.940> at<00:03:53.030> it<00:03:53.150> just<00:03:53.330> as

00:03:53.470 --> 00:03:53.480 
it is there you're looking at it just as

00:03:53.480 --> 00:03:56.080 
it is there you're looking at it just as
I<00:03:53.630> am<00:03:53.810> I<00:03:54.080> can't<00:03:54.290> see<00:03:54.709> any<00:03:54.830> difference<00:03:55.090> apart

00:03:56.080 --> 00:03:56.090 
I am I can't see any difference apart

00:03:56.090 --> 00:03:58.900 
I am I can't see any difference apart
from<00:03:56.239> just<00:03:56.420> being<00:03:56.660> a<00:03:56.870> little<00:03:57.200> bit<00:03:57.760> and<00:03:58.760> it's

00:03:58.900 --> 00:03:58.910 
from just being a little bit and it's

00:03:58.910 --> 00:04:01.840 
from just being a little bit and it's
not<00:03:58.940> quite<00:03:59.269> as<00:03:59.420> smooth<00:03:59.810> I<00:04:00.519> can't<00:04:01.519> see<00:04:01.700> any

00:04:01.840 --> 00:04:01.850 
not quite as smooth I can't see any

00:04:01.850 --> 00:04:05.560 
not quite as smooth I can't see any
difference<00:04:02.150> in<00:04:02.300> the<00:04:02.390> hole<00:04:04.360> it's<00:04:05.360> good<00:04:05.540> good

00:04:05.560 --> 00:04:05.570 
difference in the hole it's good good

00:04:05.570 --> 00:04:07.120 
difference in the hole it's good good
alternative<00:04:06.260> I<00:04:06.290> mean<00:04:06.440> kind<00:04:06.620> of<00:04:06.680> nice<00:04:06.830> if<00:04:07.040> you

00:04:07.120 --> 00:04:07.130 
alternative I mean kind of nice if you

00:04:07.130 --> 00:04:08.560 
alternative I mean kind of nice if you
have<00:04:07.220> to<00:04:07.310> go<00:04:07.430> out<00:04:07.580> and<00:04:07.610> drill<00:04:07.970> multiple<00:04:08.390> holes

00:04:08.560 --> 00:04:08.570 
have to go out and drill multiple holes

00:04:08.570 --> 00:04:11.530 
have to go out and drill multiple holes
to<00:04:08.840> have<00:04:08.989> one<00:04:09.230> tool<00:04:09.470> in<00:04:10.400> your<00:04:10.640> box<00:04:11.030> versus

00:04:11.530 --> 00:04:11.540 
to have one tool in your box versus

00:04:11.540 --> 00:04:14.259 
to have one tool in your box versus
several<00:04:12.200> but<00:04:12.440> I'm<00:04:12.920> surprised<00:04:13.670> I<00:04:13.910> did<00:04:14.120> not

00:04:14.259 --> 00:04:14.269 
several but I'm surprised I did not

00:04:14.269 --> 00:04:17.680 
several but I'm surprised I did not
expect<00:04:14.690> it<00:04:14.870> to<00:04:15.769> work<00:04:15.799> that<00:04:16.160> well<00:04:16.370> let's<00:04:17.269> test

00:04:17.680 --> 00:04:17.690 
expect it to work that well let's test

00:04:17.690 --> 00:04:21.039 
expect it to work that well let's test
the<00:04:17.959> belly<00:04:18.919> drill<00:04:19.330> or<00:04:20.330> the<00:04:20.479> shoulder<00:04:20.810> drill

00:04:21.039 --> 00:04:21.049 
the belly drill or the shoulder drill

00:04:21.049 --> 00:04:23.530 
the belly drill or the shoulder drill
here<00:04:21.290> put<00:04:21.950> it<00:04:22.010> on<00:04:22.040> my<00:04:22.160> shoulder<00:04:22.540> actually

00:04:23.530 --> 00:04:23.540 
here put it on my shoulder actually

00:04:23.540 --> 00:04:26.050 
here put it on my shoulder actually
feels<00:04:24.169> too<00:04:24.440> short<00:04:24.740> for<00:04:24.919> my<00:04:25.010> shoulder<00:04:25.400> I'm

00:04:26.050 --> 00:04:26.060 
feels too short for my shoulder I'm

00:04:26.060 --> 00:04:27.960 
feels too short for my shoulder I'm

speeds<00:04:45.730> too<00:04:45.910> high<00:04:46.470> now<00:04:47.470> again<00:04:47.740> I'm<00:04:47.980> I'm

00:04:48.180 --> 00:04:48.190 
speeds too high now again I'm I'm

00:04:48.190 --> 00:04:49.950 
speeds too high now again I'm I'm
learning<00:04:48.640> with<00:04:48.730> you<00:04:48.850> guys<00:04:49.060> sir<00:04:49.270> I<00:04:49.300> have<00:04:49.780> not

00:04:49.950 --> 00:04:49.960 
learning with you guys sir I have not

00:04:49.960 --> 00:04:52.320 
learning with you guys sir I have not
used<00:04:50.170> this<00:04:50.380> before<00:04:50.800> so<00:04:51.220> obviously<00:04:51.490> the<00:04:52.030> speed

00:04:52.320 --> 00:04:52.330 
used this before so obviously the speed

00:04:52.330 --> 00:04:53.730 
used this before so obviously the speed
was<00:04:52.570> too<00:04:52.600> high<00:04:52.870> I<00:04:53.050> couldn't<00:04:53.350> get<00:04:53.440> the<00:04:53.530> torque

00:04:53.730 --> 00:04:53.740 
was too high I couldn't get the torque

00:04:53.740 --> 00:04:56.730 
was too high I couldn't get the torque
on<00:04:53.920> it<00:04:53.950> so<00:04:54.790> we'll<00:04:55.000> go<00:04:55.540> to<00:04:55.600> the<00:04:55.810> lower<00:04:56.020> gear<00:04:56.320> here

00:04:56.730 --> 00:04:56.740 
on it so we'll go to the lower gear here

00:04:56.740 --> 00:04:59.250 
on it so we'll go to the lower gear here
that's<00:04:56.920> a<00:04:57.010> pretty<00:04:57.160> good<00:04:57.370> sized<00:04:57.580> hole<00:04:58.230> for<00:04:59.230> a

00:04:59.250 --> 00:04:59.260 
that's a pretty good sized hole for a

00:04:59.260 --> 00:05:01.800 
that's a pretty good sized hole for a
hand<00:04:59.500> drill<00:04:59.650> a<00:04:59.770> one-inch<00:05:00.130> like<00:05:00.340> that<00:05:00.520> so<00:05:00.810> let's

00:05:01.800 --> 00:05:01.810 
hand drill a one-inch like that so let's

00:05:01.810 --> 00:05:05.090 
hand drill a one-inch like that so let's
see<00:05:01.870> if<00:05:01.990> that<00:05:02.050> doesn't<00:05:02.350> work<00:05:02.410> a<00:05:02.530> little<00:05:02.620> better

00:05:05.090 --> 00:05:05.100 

00:05:05.100 --> 00:05:07.350 

now<00:05:06.100> we<00:05:06.160> didn't<00:05:06.490> really<00:05:06.700> drill<00:05:06.940> much<00:05:07.150> of<00:05:07.270> a

00:05:07.350 --> 00:05:07.360 
now we didn't really drill much of a

00:05:07.360 --> 00:05:10.590 
now we didn't really drill much of a
hole<00:05:07.540> there<00:05:07.750> so<00:05:07.930> we'll<00:05:08.020> back<00:05:08.200> it<00:05:08.260> out<00:05:09.600> all

00:05:10.590 --> 00:05:10.600 
hole there so we'll back it out all

00:05:10.600 --> 00:05:22.080 
hole there so we'll back it out all

but I do have an eight and a half so

00:06:51.879 --> 00:06:55.529 
but I do have an eight and a half so
it's<00:06:52.000> even<00:06:52.270> a<00:06:52.449> bigger<00:06:52.930> bit<00:06:54.029> but<00:06:55.029> let's<00:06:55.210> try<00:06:55.479> it

00:06:55.529 --> 00:06:55.539 
it's even a bigger bit but let's try it

00:06:55.539 --> 00:06:57.529 
it's even a bigger bit but let's try it
let's<00:06:56.050> see<00:06:56.259> how<00:06:56.469> the<00:06:56.529> beam<00:06:56.800> drill<00:06:57.099> does

00:06:57.529 --> 00:06:57.539 
let's see how the beam drill does

00:06:57.539 --> 00:06:59.869 
let's see how the beam drill does
compared<00:06:58.539> to<00:06:58.719> the<00:06:58.839> other<00:06:58.990> ones

00:06:59.869 --> 00:06:59.879 
compared to the other ones

00:06:59.879 --> 00:07:01.890 
compared to the other ones
all<00:07:00.879> right<00:07:01.029> we're<00:07:01.210> going<00:07:01.389> to<00:07:01.419> inch<00:07:01.539> and<00:07:01.599> a<00:07:01.690> half

00:07:01.890 --> 00:07:01.900 
all right we're going to inch and a half

00:07:01.900 --> 00:07:05.339 
all right we're going to inch and a half
instead<00:07:02.080> of<00:07:02.289> one<00:07:02.440> inch<00:07:02.620> on<00:07:03.430> your<00:07:03.610> mark<00:07:04.050> get<00:07:05.050> set

00:07:05.339 --> 00:07:05.349 
instead of one inch on your mark get set

00:07:05.349 --> 00:07:08.060 
instead of one inch on your mark get set
go

00:07:08.060 --> 00:07:08.070 

00:07:08.070 --> 00:07:31.450 

I<00:07:23.060> don't<00:07:24.060> know<00:07:24.150> if<00:07:24.210> I'm<00:07:24.330> through<00:07:24.540> or<00:07:24.690> not<00:07:26.240> nope

00:07:31.450 --> 00:07:31.460 

00:07:31.460 --> 00:07:33.580 

there<00:07:32.460> we<00:07:32.550> go

00:07:33.580 --> 00:07:33.590 
there we go

00:07:33.590 --> 00:07:37.960 
there we go
that<00:07:34.590> was<00:07:34.770> much<00:07:35.040> better<00:07:35.750> that<00:07:36.750> was<00:07:36.930> actually<00:07:37.350> I

00:07:37.960 --> 00:07:37.970 
that was much better that was actually I

00:07:37.970 --> 00:07:42.140 
that was much better that was actually I
was<00:07:38.970> actually<00:07:39.150> quite<00:07:39.570> enjoyable<00:07:40.730> and<00:07:41.730> a<00:07:41.910> whole

was actually quite enjoyable and a whole

00:07:42.150 --> 00:07:45.050 
was actually quite enjoyable and a whole
lot<00:07:42.360> less<00:07:42.570> effort<00:07:43.580> let's<00:07:44.580> take<00:07:44.700> a<00:07:44.760> look<00:07:44.910> at<00:07:44.970> the

00:07:45.050 --> 00:07:45.060 
lot less effort let's take a look at the
