why<00:03:17.390> because<00:03:18.350> and<00:03:18.940> the<00:03:19.940> texture<00:03:20.480> is<00:03:20.890> kind<00:03:21.890> of

00:03:22.120 --> 00:03:22.130 
why because and the texture is kind of

00:03:22.130 --> 00:03:26.860 
why because and the texture is kind of
the<00:03:22.400> loose<00:03:22.880> and<00:03:23.330> the<00:03:23.510> puffy<00:03:23.960> it<00:03:24.950> will<00:03:25.340> take<00:03:25.870> the

00:03:26.860 --> 00:03:26.870 
the loose and the puffy it will take the

00:03:26.870 --> 00:03:30.370 
the loose and the puffy it will take the
salt<00:03:27.140> before<00:03:27.800> the<00:03:28.040> tomato<00:03:28.640> taking<00:03:29.240> it<00:03:29.450> I<00:03:29.780> don't

00:03:30.370 --> 00:03:30.380 
salt before the tomato taking it I don't

00:03:30.380 --> 00:03:32.890 
salt before the tomato taking it I don't
want<00:03:30.560> the<00:03:30.770> egg<00:03:30.920> eventually<00:03:31.760> become<00:03:32.090> too<00:03:32.360> salty

00:03:32.890 --> 00:03:32.900 
want the egg eventually become too salty

00:03:32.900 --> 00:03:35.650 
want the egg eventually become too salty
so<00:03:33.410> I<00:03:33.650> put<00:03:33.980> the<00:03:34.100> salt<00:03:34.370> directly<00:03:35.030> to<00:03:35.180> the<00:03:35.270> tomato

00:03:35.650 --> 00:03:35.660
