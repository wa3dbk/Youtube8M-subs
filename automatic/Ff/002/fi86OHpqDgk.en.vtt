were<00:01:53.700> pretty<00:01:53.759> solid<00:01:54.299> for<00:01:55.200> a<00:01:55.229> I<00:01:55.680> think<00:01:56.430> he's<00:01:56.520> a

00:01:56.539 --> 00:01:56.549 
were pretty solid for a I think he's a

00:01:56.549 --> 00:02:00.350 
were pretty solid for a I think he's a
92<00:01:57.180> I<00:01:57.210> didn't<00:01:57.600> look<00:01:58.280> but<00:01:59.280> for<00:01:59.520> a<00:01:59.549> final<00:01:59.790> edition

00:02:00.350 --> 00:02:00.360 
92 I didn't look but for a final edition

00:02:00.360 --> 00:02:03.950 
92 I didn't look but for a final edition
linebacker<00:02:01.170> that's<00:02:01.500> pretty<00:02:01.710> good<00:02:01.979> and<00:02:02.700> a<00:02:03.420> 91

00:02:03.950 --> 00:02:03.960 
linebacker that's pretty good and a 91

00:02:03.960 --> 00:02:06.139 
linebacker that's pretty good and a 91
so<00:02:04.259> let's<00:02:05.070> move<00:02:05.189> on<00:02:05.369> to<00:02:05.399> a<00:02:05.549> fourth<00:02:05.790> pack<00:02:05.939> and<00:02:06.119> I

00:02:06.139 --> 00:02:06.149 
so let's move on to a fourth pack and I

00:02:06.149 --> 00:02:07.700 
so let's move on to a fourth pack and I
think<00:02:06.329> this<00:02:06.420> is<00:02:06.479> pretty<00:02:06.689> cool<00:02:06.810> though<00:02:07.170> all<00:02:07.380> 10

00:02:07.700 --> 00:02:07.710 
think this is pretty cool though all 10
