00:00:00.529 --> 00:00:02.460
 two thousand years ago 

00:00:02.460 --> 00:00:05.460
 god the creator 

00:00:06.470 --> 00:00:09.470
 and our land with the name of Jesus 

00:00:11.999 --> 00:00:14.999
 already established the new plan 

00:00:15.739 --> 00:00:17.720
 through the new covenant 

00:00:17.720 --> 00:00:19.109
 the children of God 

00:00:19.109 --> 00:00:22.259
 who are suffering for the sins of death 

00:00:22.259 --> 00:00:25.489
 two 

00:00:25.489 --> 00:00:27.569
 they can say 

00:00:27.569 --> 00:00:30.569
 and the decision 

00:00:31.109 --> 00:00:33.260
 for three years 

00:00:33.260 --> 00:00:35.710
 jesus gave the example 

00:00:35.710 --> 00:00:38.710
 to keep the new covenant to his physical 

00:00:41.280 --> 00:00:44.740
 because temples city 

00:00:44.740 --> 00:00:47.020
 so that as I have done to you 

00:00:47.020 --> 00:00:50.100
 you also to them 

00:00:50.100 --> 00:00:52.910
 after the resurrection 

00:00:52.910 --> 00:00:56.860
 Jesus told his disciples that preaching encourages all nations 

00:00:58.470 --> 00:01:01.470
 a new covenant that would not be salvation 

00:01:07.510 --> 00:01:10.510
 2 icaro moyano 

00:01:13.660 --> 00:01:16.660
 go back to the old ways 

00:01:18.540 --> 00:01:21.320
 was which we can receive the per 

00:01:21.320 --> 00:01:23.190
 and return to the kingdom of heaven 

00:01:23.190 --> 00:01:26.190
 there is a rule 

00:01:27.350 --> 00:01:30.350
 all male bull with justice with his head covered 

00:01:38.570 --> 00:01:41.570
 delve into the head of series 

00:01:47.600 --> 00:01:49.500
 English is to say 

00:01:49.500 --> 00:01:51.520
 established this 

00:01:51.520 --> 00:01:54.550
 the woman worships with her head covered by a veil 

00:01:55.480 --> 00:01:56.299
 the man 

00:01:56.299 --> 00:01:59.299
 bareheaded 

00:02:01.590 --> 00:02:03.210
 but nevertheless 

00:02:03.210 --> 00:02:06.250
 after the ascension of Jesus 

00:02:06.250 --> 00:02:09.830
 some women insisted on not wearing the veil in the cult 

00:02:11.579 --> 00:02:13.169
 About this 

00:02:13.169 --> 00:02:16.609
 the apostle Paul Letelier sergeant 

00:02:16.609 --> 00:02:19.609
 explaining through the network 

00:02:22.459 --> 00:02:25.459
 wear long hair 

00:02:27.069 --> 00:02:30.499
 we will look for others 

00:02:30.499 --> 00:02:31.979
 ruined that the woman 

00:02:31.979 --> 00:02:34.979
 god god without covering his head 

00:02:37.829 --> 00:02:40.829
 nature itself 

00:02:41.969 --> 00:02:45.349
 teaches us that the male and this one only grows their hair 

00:02:46.919 --> 00:02:48.139
 Conversely 

00:02:48.139 --> 00:02:51.139
 to the woman to let her hair grow 

00:02:51.919 --> 00:02:55.349
 because she has been given long hair to cover her head 

00:02:57.119 --> 00:02:58.399
 for all this 

00:02:58.399 --> 00:03:01.259
 If anyone wants to be contentious 

00:03:01.259 --> 00:03:04.259
 we do not have such custom 

00:03:04.259 --> 00:03:07.259
 churches etc 

00:03:07.889 --> 00:03:10.889
 the bible says clearly 

00:03:16.109 --> 00:03:19.109
 perhaps 

00:03:21.549 --> 00:03:25.529
 it is the will of God and the rule of the point of the new covenant 

00:03:25.529 --> 00:03:28.329
 that Jesus taught and the apostle Pablo Perez
