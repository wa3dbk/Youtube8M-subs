00:00:14.730 --> 00:00:17.299
 two 

00:00:17.860 --> 00:00:23.500
 the victims are confused they do not feel 

00:00:21.050 --> 00:00:23.500
 the next 

00:00:24.140 --> 00:00:26.710
 Bis 

00:00:28.870 --> 00:00:34.930
 I wanted to see what you would do 

00:00:31.360 --> 00:00:37.590
 and it was not an exception, you let die 

00:00:34.930 --> 00:00:41.700
 five people 

00:00:37.590 --> 00:00:44.580
 and then you agreed to take your place and 

00:00:41.700 --> 00:00:46.650
 this for me is to write these mobsters 

00:00:44.580 --> 00:00:48.910
 they want you dead so everything goes back to 

00:00:46.650 --> 00:00:51.460
 be as before 

00:00:48.910 --> 00:00:54.400
 but I know the truth will not be like 

00:00:51.460 --> 00:00:56.730
 before you changed things for 

00:00:54.400 --> 00:00:56.730
 forever 

00:00:58.469 --> 00:01:03.850
 I do not want to kill you wanted to stay 

00:01:01.660 --> 00:01:09.100
 without you to steal from the gangsters again 

00:01:03.850 --> 00:01:11.670
 no no no no all you are the other part 

00:01:09.100 --> 00:01:13.909
 from my 

00:01:11.670 --> 00:01:17.810
 do not talk like one of them you're not like that 

00:01:13.909 --> 00:01:17.810
 although I would like to be true 

00:01:18.520 --> 00:01:25.030
 for that he is just a monster 

00:01:20.540 --> 00:01:27.420
 How do I need the time 

00:01:25.030 --> 00:01:31.110

00:01:27.420 --> 00:01:34.820
 of dawn operated as leper his 

00:01:31.110 --> 00:01:34.820
 mural of his 

00:01:36.870 --> 00:01:40.440
 they will forget you at the first sign of 

00:01:38.580 --> 00:01:42.570
 problems 

00:01:40.440 --> 00:01:45.030
 they are only as good as the world is 

00:01:42.570 --> 00:01:48.420
 allows but safe when there 

00:01:45.030 --> 00:01:52.720
 difficulties all these people 

00:01:48.420 --> 00:01:55.950

00:01:52.720 --> 00:01:55.950
 I am not me much 

00:01:56.100 --> 00:01:59.450

00:02:00.470 --> 00:02:05.080

00:02:02.690 --> 00:02:05.080

00:02:09.060 --> 00:02:13.040
 you have to break that rule to know 

00:02:11.590 --> 00:02:15.319
 the truth 

00:02:13.040 --> 00:02:17.750
 the only way to live in the world is 

00:02:15.319 --> 00:02:19.870
 without rules and that night everything will break its 

00:02:17.750 --> 00:02:21.640
