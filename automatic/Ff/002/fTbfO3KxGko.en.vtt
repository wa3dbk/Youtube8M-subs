you're probably starting here so let's
look<00:00:55.040> at<00:00:55.190> these<00:00:55.310> settings<00:00:55.700> one<00:00:55.850> by<00:00:56.000> one<00:00:56.180> to<00:00:56.270> see

00:00:56.320 --> 00:00:56.330 
look at these settings one by one to see

00:00:56.330 --> 00:00:57.460 
look at these settings one by one to see
what<00:00:56.510> they<00:00:56.690> do<00:00:56.750> you<00:00:57.020> see<00:00:57.170> where<00:00:57.290> it<00:00:57.350> says

00:00:57.460 --> 00:00:57.470 
what they do you see where it says

00:00:57.470 --> 00:00:59.980 
what they do you see where it says
pickup<00:00:57.800> type<00:00:58.090> I've<00:00:59.090> already<00:00:59.450> set<00:00:59.690> it<00:00:59.720> for<00:00:59.960> the

00:00:59.980 --> 00:00:59.990 
pickup type I've already set it for the

00:00:59.990 --> 00:01:01.930 
pickup type I've already set it for the
proper<00:01:00.380> setting<00:01:00.710> which<00:01:00.830> is<00:01:00.860> piezo<00:01:01.400> R<00:01:01.640> which

00:01:01.930 --> 00:01:01.940 
proper setting which is piezo R which

00:01:01.940 --> 00:01:04.570 
proper setting which is piezo R which
stands<00:01:02.180> for<00:01:02.390> our<00:01:02.570> MC<00:01:03.130> perhaps<00:01:04.130> when<00:01:04.280> you<00:01:04.370> first

00:01:04.570 --> 00:01:04.580 
stands for our MC perhaps when you first

00:01:04.580 --> 00:01:08.430 
stands for our MC perhaps when you first
start<00:01:04.850> it<00:01:04.910> out<00:01:05.059> gr<00:01:05.900> 55<00:01:06.410> was<00:01:06.620> set<00:01:06.830> for<00:01:07.100> gk3

00:01:08.430 --> 00:01:08.440 
start it out gr 55 was set for gk3

00:01:08.440 --> 00:01:11.080 
start it out gr 55 was set for gk3
scroll<00:01:09.440> through<00:01:09.650> here<00:01:09.920> you<00:01:10.190> can<00:01:10.250> go<00:01:10.460> past<00:01:10.670> PI

00:01:11.080 --> 00:01:11.090 
scroll through here you can go past PI

00:01:11.090 --> 00:01:13.090 
scroll through here you can go past PI
so<00:01:11.150> this<00:01:11.510> is<00:01:11.690> generic<00:01:12.110> or<00:01:12.260> piezo<00:01:12.680> depending

00:01:13.090 --> 00:01:13.100 
so this is generic or piezo depending

00:01:13.100 --> 00:01:14.740 
so this is generic or piezo depending

I'm using my fingers not a pic so these

00:02:09.460 --> 00:02:09.470 
settings are going to be maybe different

00:02:09.470 --> 00:02:11.710

from<00:02:09.530> what<00:02:09.770> the<00:02:09.890> factory<00:02:10.250> preset<00:02:10.700> is<00:02:10.850> so<00:02:11.660> I'm

00:02:11.710 --> 00:02:11.720 
from what the factory preset is so I'm

00:02:11.720 --> 00:02:12.970 
from what the factory preset is so I'm
going<00:02:11.870> to<00:02:11.930> show<00:02:12.080> it<00:02:12.170> each<00:02:12.380> string<00:02:12.710> I'm<00:02:12.860> going

00:02:12.970 --> 00:02:12.980 
going to show it each string I'm going

to play each string open one string at a
time<00:02:15.440> to<00:02:15.830> get<00:02:16.010> my<00:02:16.160> level

00:02:19.710 --> 00:02:19.720 

00:02:19.720 --> 00:02:23.230 

notice<00:02:20.720> that<00:02:20.840> I'm<00:02:20.960> pinging<00:02:21.590> the<00:02:21.830> needle<00:02:22.240> so

00:02:23.230 --> 00:02:23.240 
notice that I'm pinging the needle so

00:02:23.240 --> 00:02:24.520 
notice that I'm pinging the needle so
it's<00:02:23.360> probably<00:02:23.690> a<00:02:23.750> little<00:02:23.930> too<00:02:24.020> high<00:02:24.230> so<00:02:24.440> I'm

00:02:24.520 --> 00:02:24.530 
it's probably a little too high so I'm

00:02:24.530 --> 00:02:25.870 
it's probably a little too high so I'm
going<00:02:24.650> to<00:02:24.710> turn<00:02:24.830> it<00:02:24.950> down<00:02:25.069> a<00:02:25.130> little<00:02:25.310> bit<00:02:25.550> till

00:02:25.870 --> 00:02:25.880 
going to turn it down a little bit till

00:02:25.880 --> 00:02:28.490 
going to turn it down a little bit till
I<00:02:25.940> get<00:02:26.000> it<00:02:26.240> to<00:02:26.390> just<00:02:26.960> before<00:02:27.470> that

00:02:28.490 --> 00:02:28.500 
I get it to just before that

00:02:28.500 --> 00:02:31.040 
I get it to just before that
that<00:02:29.100> looks<00:02:29.310> pretty<00:02:29.460> good<00:02:29.610> let's<00:02:30.600> go<00:02:30.780> to<00:02:30.840> the

00:02:31.040 --> 00:02:31.050 
that looks pretty good let's go to the

00:02:31.050 --> 00:02:34.390 
that looks pretty good let's go to the
next<00:02:31.230> one

00:02:34.390 --> 00:02:34.400 

00:02:34.400 --> 00:02:36.430 

it's<00:02:35.090> too<00:02:35.299> hot<00:02:35.510> let's<00:02:35.810> take<00:02:35.989> it<00:02:36.110> down<00:02:36.140> a<00:02:36.290> little

00:02:36.430 --> 00:02:36.440 
it's too hot let's take it down a little

00:02:36.440 --> 00:02:42.759 
it's too hot let's take it down a little
bit<00:02:39.250> to<00:02:40.250> about<00:02:40.459> hearing<00:02:41.019> there's<00:02:42.019> no<00:02:42.200> perfect

00:02:42.759 --> 00:02:42.769 
bit to about hearing there's no perfect

00:02:42.769 --> 00:02:44.440 
bit to about hearing there's no perfect
setting<00:02:43.280> for<00:02:43.310> this<00:02:43.519> this<00:02:43.730> depends<00:02:44.180> on<00:02:44.239> how<00:02:44.390> you

00:02:44.440 --> 00:02:44.450 
setting for this this depends on how you

00:02:44.450 --> 00:02:46.149 
setting for this this depends on how you
play<00:02:44.659> everybody's<00:02:45.470> going<00:02:45.620> to<00:02:45.680> be<00:02:45.799> different

00:02:46.149 --> 00:02:46.159 
play everybody's going to be different

00:02:46.159 --> 00:02:48.220 
play everybody's going to be different
so<00:02:46.310> just<00:02:46.670> experiment<00:02:47.360> with<00:02:47.450> it<00:02:47.569> to<00:02:47.750> get<00:02:47.959> it<00:02:48.110> in

00:02:48.220 --> 00:02:48.230 
so just experiment with it to get it in

00:02:48.230 --> 00:02:59.229 
so just experiment with it to get it in
the<00:02:48.319> right<00:02:48.500> place<00:02:50.230> it's<00:02:51.230> probably<00:02:57.940> any<00:02:58.940> good

00:02:59.229 --> 00:02:59.239 
the right place it's probably any good

00:02:59.239 --> 00:03:01.449 
the right place it's probably any good
so<00:02:59.930> okay<00:03:00.200> if<00:03:00.319> you<00:03:00.409> hit<00:03:00.560> it<00:03:00.680> maybe<00:03:00.860> once<00:03:01.220> in<00:03:01.400> a

00:03:01.449 --> 00:03:01.459 
so okay if you hit it maybe once in a

00:03:01.459 --> 00:03:02.680 
so okay if you hit it maybe once in a
great<00:03:01.489> while<00:03:01.670> but<00:03:02.090> if<00:03:02.180> it's<00:03:02.299> going<00:03:02.450> there<00:03:02.659> a

00:03:02.680 --> 00:03:02.690 
great while but if it's going there a

00:03:02.690 --> 00:03:05.800 
great while but if it's going there a
lot<00:03:02.930> it's<00:03:03.230> too<00:03:03.500> high<00:03:03.970> let's<00:03:04.970> try<00:03:05.269> the<00:03:05.329> D<00:03:05.569> string

00:03:05.800 --> 00:03:05.810 
lot it's too high let's try the D string

many times when you're playing guitar
maybe<00:05:19.500> you<00:05:19.740> miss<00:05:19.980> a<00:05:20.010> string<00:05:20.460> or<00:05:20.670> you<00:05:20.760> touch<00:05:21.000> a

00:05:24.290 --> 00:05:24.300 
guitar a note comes out just like you

00:05:24.300 --> 00:05:28.160 
guitar a note comes out just like you
heard<00:05:24.420> it<00:05:24.600> do<00:05:25.460> low<00:05:26.460> velocity<00:05:26.970> cut<00:05:27.510> can<00:05:27.810> clip

00:05:28.160 --> 00:05:28.170 
heard it do low velocity cut can clip

00:05:28.170 --> 00:05:30.110 
heard it do low velocity cut can clip
off<00:05:28.350> extraneous<00:05:29.130> notes<00:05:29.370> that<00:05:29.580> are<00:05:29.670> underneath

off extraneous notes that are underneath

00:05:30.120 --> 00:05:32.240 
off extraneous notes that are underneath
a<00:05:30.300> certain<00:05:30.600> threshold<00:05:30.750> of<00:05:31.080> volume<00:05:31.440> so<00:05:32.220> you

00:05:32.240 --> 00:05:32.250 
a certain threshold of volume so you

00:05:32.250 --> 00:05:33.890 
a certain threshold of volume so you
don't<00:05:32.460> have<00:05:32.670> too<00:05:32.910> many<00:05:33.000> extraneous<00:05:33.540> notes<00:05:33.750> you

00:05:33.890 --> 00:05:33.900 
don't have too many extraneous notes you

00:05:33.900 --> 00:05:35.390 
don't have too many extraneous notes you
can<00:05:33.990> cut<00:05:34.200> them<00:05:34.350> off<00:05:34.470> all<00:05:34.650> together<00:05:34.830> and<00:05:35.220> keep

00:05:35.390 --> 00:05:35.400 
can cut them off all together and keep

00:05:35.400 --> 00:05:37.970 
can cut them off all together and keep
just<00:05:36.000> the<00:05:36.120> ones<00:05:36.270> you<00:05:36.390> meant<00:05:36.690> to<00:05:37.080> play<00:05:37.260> the

00:05:37.970 --> 00:05:37.980

00:05:41.600 --> 00:05:41.610 
only knows what it heard you do so if

00:05:41.610 --> 00:05:43.010 
only knows what it heard you do so if
you<00:05:41.670> can<00:05:41.820> clip<00:05:41.970> off<00:05:42.120> the<00:05:42.150> ones<00:05:42.450> you<00:05:42.570> don't<00:05:42.780> want

00:05:43.010 --> 00:05:43.020 
you can clip off the ones you don't want

00:05:43.020 --> 00:05:45.800 
you can clip off the ones you don't want
it<00:05:43.320> helps<00:05:43.590> a<00:05:43.650> lot<00:05:43.830> I<00:05:44.160> found<00:05:45.030> that<00:05:45.150> with<00:05:45.270> RMC

00:05:45.800 --> 00:05:45.810 
it helps a lot I found that with RMC

00:05:45.810 --> 00:05:47.180 
it helps a lot I found that with RMC
pickups<00:05:46.170> it's<00:05:46.350> good<00:05:46.470> to<00:05:46.590> take<00:05:46.740> this<00:05:46.890> up<00:05:47.070> to

00:05:47.180 --> 00:05:47.190 
pickups it's good to take this up to

00:05:47.190 --> 00:05:49.130 
pickups it's good to take this up to
maybe<00:05:47.370> 7<00:05:47.820> or<00:05:47.880> 8<00:05:48.060> or<00:05:48.210> maybe<00:05:48.360> even<00:05:48.450> 9<00:05:48.780> I'm<00:05:48.990> going

00:05:49.130 --> 00:05:49.140 
maybe 7 or 8 or maybe even 9 I'm going

00:05:49.140 --> 00:05:51.410 
maybe 7 or 8 or maybe even 9 I'm going
to<00:05:49.200> set<00:05:49.380> it<00:05:49.470> for<00:05:49.500> 8<00:05:49.710> for<00:05:49.980> now<00:05:50.130> and<00:05:50.490> see<00:05:51.090> how<00:05:51.240> it

00:05:51.410 --> 00:05:51.420 
to set it for 8 for now and see how it

00:05:51.420 --> 00:05:53.930 
to set it for 8 for now and see how it
is<00:05:51.710> so<00:05:52.710> those<00:05:52.890> are<00:05:53.070> the<00:05:53.190> relevant<00:05:53.610> settings

00:05:53.930 --> 00:05:53.940 
is so those are the relevant settings

let's go back to the sound and see how

00:05:55.470 --> 00:06:03.640 
let's go back to the sound and see how
it<00:05:55.560> works<00:05:55.740> now

00:06:03.640 --> 00:06:03.650
