same way that you would want to turn the

00:01:51.210 --> 00:01:55.160 
same way that you would want to turn the
wire<00:01:52.820> now<00:01:53.820> I<00:01:53.850> have<00:01:54.119> to<00:01:54.270> get<00:01:54.509> turned<00:01:54.840> a<00:01:55.020> little

00:02:56.400 --> 00:03:03.380 
and then peel the tape off and then just
keep<00:02:56.610> turning<00:02:56.880> it<00:02:57.240> and<00:03:00.890> after<00:03:01.890> a<00:03:01.920> while<00:03:02.390> see

00:03:03.380 --> 00:03:03.390 
keep turning it and after a while see

00:03:03.390 --> 00:03:14.009 
keep turning it and after a while see
how<00:03:03.420> it<00:03:03.660> is<00:03:03.780> going<00:03:04.050> in<00:03:04.320> there

00:03:14.009 --> 00:03:14.019 

00:03:14.019 --> 00:03:16.150 

after<00:03:15.019> a<00:03:15.050> while<00:03:15.230> you'll<00:03:15.470> come<00:03:15.680> out<00:03:15.709> with<00:03:15.860> an

00:03:16.150 --> 00:03:16.160 
after a while you'll come out with an

00:03:16.160 --> 00:03:18.640 
after a while you'll come out with an
like<00:03:16.459> that<00:03:16.730> and<00:03:17.629> most<00:03:17.930> of<00:03:18.110> the<00:03:18.230> time<00:03:18.440> the

00:03:18.640 --> 00:03:18.650 
like that and most of the time the

00:03:18.650 --> 00:03:22.240 
like that and most of the time the
electrical<00:03:19.190> tape<00:03:19.370> will<00:03:19.640> actually<00:03:20.030> help<00:03:21.250> hold

00:03:22.240 --> 00:03:22.250 
electrical tape will actually help hold

00:03:22.250 --> 00:03:25.540 
electrical tape will actually help hold
the<00:03:22.580> wires<00:03:23.090> together<00:03:23.860> now<00:03:24.860> whenever<00:03:25.160> you<00:03:25.340> take

00:03:25.540 --> 00:03:25.550 
the wires together now whenever you take

00:03:25.550 --> 00:03:27.430 
the wires together now whenever you take
it<00:03:25.700> off<00:03:25.849> most<00:03:26.209> of<00:03:26.390> the<00:03:26.450> time<00:03:26.690> your<00:03:26.900> wires<00:03:27.110> will

00:03:27.430 --> 00:03:27.440 
it off most of the time your wires will

00:03:27.440 --> 00:03:29.170 
it off most of the time your wires will
be<00:03:27.590> all<00:03:27.739> nice<00:03:27.980> and<00:03:28.250> pushed<00:03:28.549> together<00:03:28.730> and

00:03:29.170 --> 00:03:29.180 
be all nice and pushed together and

00:03:29.180 --> 00:03:33.910 
be all nice and pushed together and
you'll<00:03:29.690> be<00:03:29.810> able<00:03:29.959> to<00:03:30.170> put<00:03:30.349> it<00:03:30.470> through<00:03:32.920> the

00:03:33.910 --> 00:03:33.920 
you'll be able to put it through the

00:03:33.920 --> 00:03:39.550 
you'll be able to put it through the
other<00:03:33.950> end<00:03:34.370> really<00:03:34.610> easy<00:03:38.140> you'll<00:03:39.140> just<00:03:39.379> be

00:03:39.550 --> 00:03:39.560 
other end really easy you'll just be

00:03:39.560 --> 00:03:41.800 
other end really easy you'll just be
able<00:03:39.680> to<00:03:39.799> throw<00:03:40.040> oh<00:03:40.280> you<00:03:41.090> want<00:03:41.299> to<00:03:41.390> put<00:03:41.569> it<00:03:41.660> down

00:03:41.800 --> 00:03:41.810 
able to throw oh you want to put it down

00:03:41.810 --> 00:03:43.930 
able to throw oh you want to put it down
through<00:03:42.590> the<00:03:42.709> threading<00:03:43.069> part<00:03:43.340> first<00:03:43.640> and

00:03:43.930 --> 00:03:43.940 
through the threading part first and

00:03:43.940 --> 00:03:46.150 
through the threading part first and
threaded<00:03:44.239> it<00:03:44.420> and<00:03:44.630> then<00:03:45.470> you'll<00:03:45.739> be<00:03:45.890> able<00:03:46.010> to

00:03:46.150 --> 00:03:46.160 
threaded it and then you'll be able to

00:03:46.160 --> 00:03:53.380 
threaded it and then you'll be able to
put<00:03:46.340> that<00:03:46.519> right<00:03:46.730> on<00:03:46.940> there<00:03:47.120> really<00:03:47.390> easy<00:03:52.390> like

00:03:53.380 --> 00:03:53.390 
put that right on there really easy like

00:03:53.390 --> 00:03:57.390 
put that right on there really easy like
so<00:03:54.370> all<00:03:55.370> right<00:03:55.579> that's<00:03:55.819> my<00:03:55.970> video<00:03:56.150> on<00:03:56.480> how<00:03:56.660> to

00:03:57.390 --> 00:03:57.400 
so all right that's my video on how to

00:03:57.400 --> 00:04:03.280 
so all right that's my video on how to
fix<00:03:58.400> afraid<00:03:58.790> or<00:03:59.390> sorry<00:04:00.260> about<00:04:00.500> that<00:04:01.989> that's<00:04:02.989> my

00:04:03.280 --> 00:04:03.290 
fix afraid or sorry about that that's my

00:04:03.290 --> 00:04:07.720 
fix afraid or sorry about that that's my
video<00:04:03.470> on<00:04:03.769> how<00:04:03.799> to<00:04:03.920> fix<00:04:04.370> afraid<00:04:04.819> bicycle<00:04:05.510> wind
