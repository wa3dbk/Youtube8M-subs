00:00:00.380 --> 00:00:08.610
 A necessary element of defense is loose ball 

00:00:04.290 --> 00:00:12.959
 After all we can not win that we can not take loose ball 

00:00:08.610 --> 00:00:14.910
 Well loose ball in order to also become a champion but is to be referred to as the important 

00:00:12.959 --> 00:00:20.099
 Just a loose ball 

00:00:14.910 --> 00:00:24.270
 The leader did a loose ball against the child because there was something wrong with the penalty 

00:00:20.099 --> 00:00:27.930
 In order to have a sense that it is important to do loose ball instead of doing 

00:00:24.270 --> 00:00:28.600
 Incorporate the loose ball drill into your regular practice 

00:00:27.930 --> 00:00:30.490
 Yes Cho little 

00:00:28.600 --> 00:00:35.710
 The 

00:00:30.490 --> 00:00:39.460
 At first there is mechanical right and left, so I do my best with slide step 

00:00:35.710 --> 00:00:40.670
 I also do to increase the handling power with the hand 

00:00:39.460 --> 00:00:45.710
 It'll do in such a way that 

00:00:40.670 --> 00:00:47.480
 Yes stop it Next of course I thought that loose ball was my own 

00:00:45.710 --> 00:00:48.860
 Than often when you do not come to the street 

00:00:47.480 --> 00:00:50.840
 Yes this time 

00:00:48.860 --> 00:00:55.550
 People who are 

00:00:50.840 --> 00:01:00.170
 The are four only where not keep up when you do not catch up to be reaction against Zong order fear 

00:00:55.550 --> 00:01:04.910
 Black step can be used this time, but when it catches it 

00:01:00.170 --> 00:01:08.000
 I'm not going to travel, I'm getting more and more clean, so let's go together 

00:01:04.910 --> 00:01:09.840
 I'm not feeling that I'm using a cross tape 

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:15.690
 Return immediately 

00:01:09.840 --> 00:01:19.830
 Do as the second carried out in such a way that yes okay 

00:01:15.690 --> 00:01:23.850
 When I get used to short loose I will try long loose next 

00:01:19.830 --> 00:01:27.510
 In a set of three, 1 roll the ball 

00:01:23.850 --> 00:01:29.540
 The ball that has fallen to the floor always dives and gets out 

00:01:27.510 --> 00:01:33.850
 And 

00:01:29.540 --> 00:01:39.580
 Yes and that receiver is important because that receiver 

00:01:33.850 --> 00:01:42.580
 If you move to a location that is easy for the person who dives , you will roll over at the top for the actual match. 

00:01:39.580 --> 00:01:45.960
 There are cases where people are being killed despite being there 

00:01:42.580 --> 00:01:50.700
 As always know what their own where you are aloud 

00:01:45.960 --> 00:01:58.520
 And those who put out the high-pass is high in Mukaida Sutotsu 

00:01:50.700 --> 00:02:02.600
 Since the normal path normally normally is passed very weak during the Pooh put out the path in this state 

00:01:58.520 --> 00:02:08.239
 Noticeable the ball much trouble it is very, which would also be cut or taken to dive 

00:02:02.600 --> 00:02:10.119
 I try to be able to give a quick pass in a form that will hit the floor from this condition. 

00:02:08.239 --> 00:02:15.660
 I will 

00:02:10.119 --> 00:02:18.400
 If in anyway receiver does not go to a place that looks and does not go as far as looks 

00:02:15.660 --> 00:02:24.040
 Add Yes and it's very good here Yuya 

00:02:18.400 --> 00:02:31.750
 And it ended up facing on, depending on the situation does not put out after all ball and say to this kind of state 

00:02:24.040 --> 00:02:32.349
 Also this state has become the axis foot facing and to Serve overturned overturned 

00:02:31.750 --> 00:02:36.220
 From 

00:02:32.349 --> 00:02:38.390
 When it is turned over and traveling is taken, a great loose ball is 

00:02:36.220 --> 00:02:46.380
 Do n't you mess up? 

00:02:38.390 --> 00:02:51.040
 Be sure to move to a place where it is easy for the other party to move and enter a few lines Yes three people Ona 

00:02:46.380 --> 00:02:52.440
 Roll 1 Dive Receiver Yes 

00:02:51.040 --> 00:02:59.100
 Somewhat 

00:02:52.440 --> 00:03:00.630
 All the way to people rolling Yes and in such a way that the person rolling i on behalf of the next receiver 

00:02:59.100 --> 00:03:06.900
 Because you can practice 

00:03:00.630 --> 00:03:09.210
 Such practice now a-building camera flying and doing in a narrow range conveniently but actually 

00:03:06.900 --> 00:03:09.930
 Is large on all courts 

00:03:09.210 --> 00:03:15.799
 so 

00:03:09.930 --> 00:03:15.799
 I'm doing my best to keep in mind things like not to go out of the coat
