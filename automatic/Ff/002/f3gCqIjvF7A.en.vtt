 dollar 

00:00:10.479 --> 00:00:13.349
 one 

00:00:13.349 --> 00:00:14.499
 that is coming 

00:00:14.499 --> 00:00:15.959
 in the spotlight 

00:00:15.959 --> 00:00:18.959
 and pulling in the garden was set at that time 

00:00:20.239 --> 00:00:23.469
 continue the clients 4 with the left 

00:00:31.189 --> 00:00:37.410
 the garden was a commissioned work in the program of Mate worthwhile in advance 

00:00:38.240 --> 00:00:40.560
 at times one of the biggest 

00:00:40.560 --> 00:00:42.290
 Percent project 

00:00:42.290 --> 00:00:46.630
 Percent to developments of a virtual television world arose 

00:00:47.520 --> 00:00:49.870
 I thought so what was 

00:00:49.870 --> 00:00:55.739
 a virtual world interactive for virtual world entirely without computer 

00:00:56.650 --> 00:00:59.580
 with material the project is 

00:00:59.580 --> 00:01:02.340
 and that, in spite of it, like today 

00:01:02.340 --> 00:01:07.320
 Percent in the media world in the media age is desired 

00:01:07.320 --> 00:01:08.440
 all scenes 

00:01:08.440 --> 00:01:11.050
 addresses simultaneously 

00:01:11.050 --> 00:01:16.990
 Ing TOS is interactive it flows in the Massif, every word is still one 

00:01:16.990 --> 00:01:20.640
 thinks best with a Sony or directly into the stomach 

00:01:21.170 --> 00:01:22.620
 and so I thought 

00:01:22.620 --> 00:01:25.900
 I take the weather the nature the birds 

00:01:26.480 --> 00:01:31.660
 the rains v the Steeb she the door in the summer altars something for us 

00:01:31.660 --> 00:01:33.140
 perfect and go 

00:01:33.140 --> 00:01:38.150
 and we close the eyes Emnid the proportions of these impressions 

00:01:38.150 --> 00:01:39.620
 similar size 

00:01:39.620 --> 00:01:40.960
 spellbound 

00:01:40.960 --> 00:01:42.180
 and of course 

00:01:42.180 --> 00:01:45.180
 intensive 

00:01:45.690 --> 00:01:48.690
 Yes 

00:01:49.380 --> 00:01:52.999
 on the way of the development of this invisible garden 

00:01:52.999 --> 00:01:54.590
 I had to 

00:01:54.590 --> 00:02:00.390
 Intensively by train take us world from the blind man deal 

00:02:00.390 --> 00:02:02.030
 I am very tedious 

00:02:02.030 --> 00:02:07.180
 On the way to brought drawings gave many talks with the 

00:02:07.180 --> 00:02:12.290
 future blind guides and the selection of saplings 

00:02:12.290 --> 00:02:15.449
 which trees came 

00:02:15.449 --> 00:02:19.819
 what tactics the surface to the sample Skeledzic Detlef Parr death 

00:02:19.819 --> 00:02:23.979
 raked deck worked out, Adobes tops remained main or if it was rather which 

00:02:23.979 --> 00:02:25.039
 is 

00:02:25.039 --> 00:02:29.609
 I do not really have that as well as those men media artistic 

00:02:29.609 --> 00:02:34.479
 Work sands the orchestrion of music putting up on violins and cellos 

00:02:34.479 --> 00:02:40.449
 Blazer that's more of an instrumental race Kulczak animals 

00:02:49.479 --> 00:02:54.459
 the sound has often been asked why as a media artist I have been around 25 years now 

00:02:54.459 --> 00:02:59.170
 Years of computer art makes me familiar with plants 

00:02:59.170 --> 00:03:00.849
 employee 

00:03:00.849 --> 00:03:05.390
 a virtual world on TV is a Visible Valdez is a nice one to me 

00:03:05.389 --> 00:03:07.010
 Kind of scenery 

00:03:07.010 --> 00:03:09.929
 but who needs to be done 

00:03:09.929 --> 00:03:12.929
 then they actually only live in the parameters 

00:03:13.639 --> 00:03:15.729
 that they have to worry about 

00:03:15.729 --> 00:03:17.390
 can be transformed 

00:03:17.390 --> 00:03:23.579
 that can be interactively changed as the navigation should be 

00:03:23.579 --> 00:03:26.969
 for the audience for the performers 

00:03:26.969 --> 00:03:31.790
 I wanted to solve that interaction and that's what I wanted 

00:03:32.399 --> 00:03:34.119
 in the picture 

00:03:34.119 --> 00:03:36.300
 build everyone know 

00:03:36.300 --> 00:03:39.680
 but in the moment where his eyes are blindfolded he felt 

00:03:40.209 --> 00:03:43.749
 that one navigates he senses that when a branch 

00:03:44.459 --> 00:03:46.879
 from a LB him in the face 

00:03:46.879 --> 00:03:48.719
 sweeps 

00:03:48.719 --> 00:03:52.589
 that he is then really passive there is something happening and when he is with his 

00:03:52.589 --> 00:03:53.629
 hand 

00:03:53.629 --> 00:03:56.719
 after a 2 kreft 

00:03:56.719 --> 00:04:00.969
 Blatter and the Porr in the arrest pushes to get ahead then it is 

00:04:00.969 --> 00:04:04.779
 that like a data Chung then feels that oh that was Maas 

00:04:05.429 --> 00:04:10.019
 Citi Field's skin stung in the right hand but I have a huge one 

00:04:10.019 --> 00:04:14.409
 believed it was a scar on the spot it could be something else 

00:04:14.409 --> 00:04:14.709
 says 

00:04:14.709 --> 00:04:18.009
 he senses that it is an action 

00:04:18.009 --> 00:04:21.189
 he has to think of course I have to go to the left or to the right 

00:04:22.210 --> 00:04:26.670
 Pushing aside the memory of the animals is lethal, this space arises 

00:04:26.670 --> 00:04:28.430
 like in a virtual 

00:04:28.430 --> 00:04:29.300
 we have 

00:04:29.300 --> 00:04:31.370
 the dream but he is him 

00:04:31.370 --> 00:04:33.259
 inside us 

00:04:33.259 --> 00:04:36.259
 all 

00:04:38.909 --> 00:04:42.249
 because many of the artists creates 

00:04:42.249 --> 00:04:46.580
 for sighted people and so the invisible garden is not a garden 

00:04:46.579 --> 00:04:52.650
 for blind people but blind people show their expertise here 

00:04:52.650 --> 00:04:54.270
 their competence 

00:04:54.270 --> 00:04:56.610
 for this merger 

00:04:56.610 --> 00:04:58.879
 the different scene 

00:04:58.879 --> 00:05:00.849
 a visual artist 

00:05:00.849 --> 00:05:02.620
 makes visual art 

00:05:02.620 --> 00:05:03.839
 also win 

00:05:03.839 --> 00:05:07.840
 the goal just once sender is that does not mean that it is not 

00:05:07.840 --> 00:05:10.930
 always if stronger then 

00:05:10.930 --> 00:05:14.349
 race 

00:05:14.349 --> 00:05:18.180
 Euro si 

00:05:18.180 --> 00:05:22.120
 they believe that in principle 

00:05:22.819 --> 00:05:24.330
 in fine art 

00:05:24.330 --> 00:05:25.559
 even if they 

00:05:25.559 --> 00:05:28.120
 almost exclusively a visual world 

00:05:28.120 --> 00:05:29.469
 offers 

00:05:29.469 --> 00:05:32.129
 is her book 

00:05:32.129 --> 00:05:34.839
 around inner worlds knows and with me 

00:05:34.839 --> 00:05:39.109
 I would almost say I almost came from Surrealism too 

00:05:39.109 --> 00:05:42.839
 because of my history I was very long the custodian of Sigmund Freud 

00:05:42.839 --> 00:05:44.419
 he needs us 

00:05:44.419 --> 00:05:46.080
 not definitely 

00:05:46.080 --> 00:05:47.139
 Alarm always 

00:05:47.139 --> 00:05:51.400
 and now in my painting bar or in my computer art or India 

00:05:51.400 --> 00:05:54.400
 interactive and virtual worlds Udo i 

00:05:55.119 --> 00:05:59.649
 in a real perceptual installation the invisible garden 

00:05:59.649 --> 00:06:02.009
 Is it really in words? 

00:06:02.009 --> 00:06:04.499
 turn mental 

00:06:04.499 --> 00:06:07.379
 the difference 

00:06:07.379 --> 00:06:12.489
 about the transformation of the world as it may and b it flows now 

00:06:12.489 --> 00:06:15.760
 very difficult to say because each shirt describes a bit different 

00:06:15.760 --> 00:06:19.900
 and the way we humans are FÃ¼rth us 

00:06:19.900 --> 00:06:24.469
 looks right this is this mental translation force 

00:06:24.469 --> 00:06:26.380
 Percent that we like the world like that 

00:06:26.380 --> 00:06:31.400
 Reconstruct Baron Construct as we wish they are these inner ones 

00:06:31.400 --> 00:06:34.080
 Worlds more 

00:06:34.080 --> 00:06:36.439
 more
