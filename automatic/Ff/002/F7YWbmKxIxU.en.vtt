table that moves from little lip on the
front<00:00:55.960> that<00:00:56.230> moves<00:00:56.530> I<00:00:57.449> know<00:00:58.449> it's<00:00:58.600> how<00:00:58.659> you<00:00:58.720> get

00:00:58.920 --> 00:00:58.930 
front that moves I know it's how you get

00:00:58.930 --> 00:01:02.399 
front that moves I know it's how you get
you<00:00:59.050> man<00:01:00.000> so<00:01:01.000> what's<00:01:01.269> the<00:01:01.360> value<00:01:01.540> of<00:01:01.900> them<00:01:02.019> why

00:01:02.399 --> 00:01:02.409 
you man so what's the value of them why

00:01:02.409 --> 00:01:04.139 
you man so what's the value of them why
do<00:01:02.470> you<00:01:02.620> use<00:01:02.739> that<00:01:02.920> instead<00:01:03.250> of<00:01:03.309> just<00:01:03.430> doing<00:01:04.030> it

00:01:04.139 --> 00:01:04.149 
do you use that instead of just doing it

00:01:04.149 --> 00:01:07.770 
do you use that instead of just doing it
by<00:01:04.239> hand<00:01:05.610> well<00:01:06.610> I<00:01:06.640> don't<00:01:07.000> know<00:01:07.090> about<00:01:07.210> you<00:01:07.539> but

00:01:10.320 --> 00:01:10.330 
my grip is not quite that strong and to

00:01:10.330 --> 00:01:15.180 
my grip is not quite that strong and to
try<00:01:10.509> and<00:01:10.690> just<00:01:10.840> bend<00:01:11.050> this<00:01:11.229> by<00:01:11.470> hand<00:01:14.130> so<00:01:15.130> you

00:01:15.180 --> 00:01:15.190 
try and just bend this by hand so you

00:01:15.190 --> 00:01:19.380 
try and just bend this by hand so you
got<00:01:15.399> a<00:01:15.429> pretty<00:01:16.060> nice<00:01:17.100> 90<00:01:18.100> degree<00:01:18.130> Bend<00:01:19.060> right

00:01:19.380 --> 00:01:19.390 
got a pretty nice 90 degree Bend right

00:01:19.390 --> 00:01:21.870 
got a pretty nice 90 degree Bend right
there<00:01:19.690> real<00:01:20.170> smooth<00:01:20.649> and<00:01:20.979> real<00:01:21.190> tiny<00:01:21.490> little

00:01:21.870 --> 00:01:21.880 
there real smooth and real tiny little

00:01:21.880 --> 00:01:26.609 
there real smooth and real tiny little
radius<00:01:22.390> on<00:01:22.890> if<00:01:23.890> I<00:01:24.039> try<00:01:24.280> to<00:01:24.340> do<00:01:24.580> that<00:01:24.789> by<00:01:24.970> hand<00:01:25.619> it

00:01:26.609 --> 00:01:26.619 
radius on if I try to do that by hand it

00:01:26.619 --> 00:01:28.800 
radius on if I try to do that by hand it
wind<00:01:27.009> up<00:01:27.220> kind<00:01:27.670> of<00:01:27.759> lumpy<00:01:28.149> and<00:01:28.330> lined<00:01:28.570> up

00:01:28.800 --> 00:01:28.810 
wind up kind of lumpy and lined up

00:01:28.810 --> 00:01:31.830 
wind up kind of lumpy and lined up
crooked<00:01:29.020> it<00:01:29.740> wind<00:01:30.160> up<00:01:30.429> very<00:01:31.210> uneven<00:01:31.720> it

00:01:31.830 --> 00:01:31.840 
crooked it wind up very uneven it

00:01:31.840 --> 00:01:33.029 
crooked it wind up very uneven it
wouldn't<00:01:32.050> be<00:01:32.140> a<00:01:32.170> blip<00:01:32.380> like<00:01:32.560> you<00:01:32.679> did<00:01:32.830> it<00:01:32.920> by

00:01:33.029 --> 00:01:33.039 
wouldn't be a blip like you did it by

00:01:33.039 --> 00:01:35.819 
wouldn't be a blip like you did it by
hand<00:01:33.220> rather<00:01:33.580> than<00:01:33.940> in<00:01:34.179> a<00:01:34.210> machine<00:01:34.710> you<00:01:35.710> could

00:01:35.819 --> 00:01:35.829 
hand rather than in a machine you could

00:01:35.829 --> 00:01:38.039 
hand rather than in a machine you could
clamp<00:01:36.100> it<00:01:36.310> in<00:01:36.400> the<00:01:36.430> vise<00:01:36.540> bend<00:01:37.540> it<00:01:37.689> over<00:01:37.750> that

00:01:38.039 --> 00:01:38.049 
clamp it in the vise bend it over that

00:01:38.049 --> 00:01:40.530 
clamp it in the vise bend it over that
way<00:01:38.290> if<00:01:38.470> your<00:01:38.650> metal<00:01:38.890> spin<00:01:39.130> enough<00:01:39.460> you<00:01:40.270> could

00:01:40.530 --> 00:01:40.540 
way if your metal spin enough you could

00:01:40.540 --> 00:01:43.260 
way if your metal spin enough you could
clamp<00:01:41.290> it<00:01:41.470> to<00:01:41.590> your<00:01:41.740> workbench<00:01:42.159> take<00:01:42.970> a<00:01:43.000> hammer

00:01:43.260 --> 00:01:43.270 
clamp it to your workbench take a hammer

00:01:43.270 --> 00:01:45.870 
clamp it to your workbench take a hammer
pound<00:01:43.990> it<00:01:44.140> down<00:01:44.170> if<00:01:45.009> you<00:01:45.159> had<00:01:45.310> a<00:01:45.340> nice<00:01:45.579> sharp

00:01:45.870 --> 00:01:45.880 
pound it down if you had a nice sharp

00:01:45.880 --> 00:01:48.510 
pound it down if you had a nice sharp
edge<00:01:46.119> on<00:01:46.420> the<00:01:46.540> edge<00:01:46.570> of<00:01:46.810> your<00:01:46.869> workbench<00:01:47.520> or

00:01:48.510 --> 00:01:48.520 
edge on the edge of your workbench or

00:01:48.520 --> 00:01:52.340 
edge on the edge of your workbench or
you<00:01:48.610> get<00:01:48.759> a<00:01:48.790> break<00:01:49.560> so<00:01:50.560> I<00:01:50.649> could<00:01:51.130> do<00:01:51.250> this<00:01:51.399> edge

00:01:52.340 --> 00:01:52.350 
you get a break so I could do this edge

00:01:52.350 --> 00:02:00.499 
you get a break so I could do this edge
and<00:01:53.350> then<00:01:53.530> I<00:01:53.649> can<00:01:53.860> come<00:01:54.070> back<00:01:54.220> and<00:01:54.579> do<00:01:57.149> that<00:01:58.149> is

00:02:00.499 --> 00:02:00.509 
and then I can come back and do that is

00:02:00.509 --> 00:02:03.539 
and then I can come back and do that is
but<00:02:01.509> then<00:02:01.659> you<00:02:01.780> think<00:02:01.930> now<00:02:02.140> wait<00:02:03.040> a<00:02:03.100> minute<00:02:03.310> I

00:02:03.539 --> 00:02:03.549 
but then you think now wait a minute I

00:02:03.549 --> 00:02:07.620 
but then you think now wait a minute I
put<00:02:04.420> this<00:02:04.540> in<00:02:04.750> here<00:02:05.079> these<00:02:05.880> two<00:02:06.880> pens<00:02:07.180> that<00:02:07.420> I

00:02:07.620 --> 00:02:07.630 
put this in here these two pens that I

00:02:07.630 --> 00:02:09.810 
put this in here these two pens that I
drew<00:02:07.840> the<00:02:07.960> size<00:02:08.200> that<00:02:08.470> I<00:02:08.560> just<00:02:08.709> bent<00:02:08.950> up<00:02:09.130> will

00:02:09.810 --> 00:02:09.820 
drew the size that I just bent up will

00:02:09.820 --> 00:02:13.069 
drew the size that I just bent up will
get<00:02:09.970> here<00:02:10.650> you<00:02:11.650> pick<00:02:11.799> out<00:02:11.980> one<00:02:12.160> of<00:02:12.190> the<00:02:12.310> fingers

00:02:13.069 --> 00:02:13.079 
get here you pick out one of the fingers

00:02:13.079 --> 00:02:15.690 
get here you pick out one of the fingers
you<00:02:14.079> can<00:02:14.260> kind<00:02:14.440> of<00:02:14.500> match<00:02:14.680> it<00:02:14.709> up<00:02:15.010> to<00:02:15.070> well<00:02:15.519> this

00:02:15.690 --> 00:02:15.700 
you can kind of match it up to well this

00:02:15.700 --> 00:02:17.340 
you can kind of match it up to well this
fingers<00:02:16.120> about<00:02:16.329> the<00:02:16.510> right<00:02:16.660> size<00:02:16.930> it<00:02:17.290> will

00:02:17.340 --> 00:02:17.350 
fingers about the right size it will

00:02:17.350 --> 00:02:22.770 
fingers about the right size it will
work<00:02:17.560> on<00:02:17.739> this<00:02:17.920> width<00:02:20.820> like<00:02:21.820> I<00:02:22.000> mean<00:02:22.239> here<00:02:22.450> it

00:02:22.770 --> 00:02:22.780 
work on this width like I mean here it

00:02:22.780 --> 00:02:29.180 
work on this width like I mean here it
just

00:02:29.180 --> 00:02:29.190 

00:02:29.190 --> 00:02:43.260 

like<00:02:30.190> Aniston<00:02:30.730> pull<00:02:30.880> a<00:02:30.910> couple<00:02:31.060> deep<00:02:42.030> and<00:02:43.030> then

00:02:43.260 --> 00:02:43.270 
like Aniston pull a couple deep and then

00:02:43.270 --> 00:02:53.340 
like Aniston pull a couple deep and then
just<00:02:43.420> go<00:02:43.510> back<00:02:43.690> in<00:02:43.870> and<00:02:44.020> line<00:02:44.200> it<00:02:44.230> up<00:02:44.470> again<00:02:52.350> and

00:02:53.340 --> 00:02:53.350 
just go back in and line it up again and

00:02:53.350 --> 00:02:55.830 
just go back in and line it up again and
then<00:02:53.470> I<00:02:53.530> got<00:02:53.740> a<00:02:53.770> nice<00:02:54.150> even<00:02:55.150> band

00:02:55.830 --> 00:02:55.840 
then I got a nice even band

00:02:55.840 --> 00:02:58.530 
then I got a nice even band
nice<00:02:56.140> straight<00:02:56.440> corner<00:02:57.100> yep<00:02:57.970> if<00:02:58.090> I<00:02:58.180> lined<00:02:58.390> it

00:02:58.530 --> 00:02:58.540 
nice straight corner yep if I lined it
