get us past that but that point you
would<00:03:58.569> have<00:03:58.720> signed<00:03:58.900> in<00:03:59.170> with<00:03:59.350> your<00:04:00.100> bits<00:04:00.250> and

00:04:00.449 --> 00:04:00.459 
would have signed in with your bits and

00:04:00.459 --> 00:04:02.819 
would have signed in with your bits and

00:04:41.159 --> 00:04:41.169 
find Dropbox really useful and so I've

00:04:41.169 --> 00:04:43.740 
find Dropbox really useful and so I've
got<00:04:41.650> a<00:04:41.680> whole<00:04:41.889> video<00:04:42.160> on<00:04:42.340> how<00:04:43.030> to<00:04:43.060> use<00:04:43.210> Dropbox

00:04:43.740 --> 00:04:43.750

00:04:43.750 --> 00:04:45.960 
got a whole video on how to use Dropbox
but<00:04:44.290> essentially<00:04:44.950> it's<00:04:45.310> a<00:04:45.430> cloud<00:04:45.639> storage

00:04:45.960 --> 00:04:45.970 
but essentially it's a cloud storage

00:04:45.970 --> 00:04:48.480 
but essentially it's a cloud storage
system<00:04:46.419> that<00:04:46.990> is<00:04:47.080> completely<00:04:47.770> free<00:04:48.160> of<00:04:48.220> charge

00:04:48.480 --> 00:04:48.490 
system that is completely free of charge

00:04:48.490 --> 00:04:52.170 
system that is completely free of charge
and<00:04:48.940> it's<00:04:49.900> well<00:04:50.200> worth<00:04:50.440> doing<00:04:50.470> it's<00:04:51.280> will

00:04:52.170 --> 00:04:52.180 
and it's well worth doing it's will

00:04:52.180 --> 00:04:54.180 
and it's well worth doing it's will

automatically upload your pictures so

00:04:54.190 --> 00:04:56.310 
automatically upload your pictures so
we're<00:04:54.970> Apple<00:04:55.240> offer<00:04:55.389> their<00:04:55.630> iCloud<00:04:55.840> service

00:04:59.460 --> 00:04:59.470 
obviously with that you need another

00:04:59.470 --> 00:05:00.840 
obviously with that you need another
Apple<00:04:59.740> device<00:04:59.950> to<00:05:00.160> be<00:05:00.190> able<00:05:00.280> to<00:05:00.490> get<00:05:00.580> on<00:05:00.700> it

00:05:00.840 --> 00:05:00.850 
Apple device to be able to get on it

Apple device to be able to get on it
this<00:05:01.389> one<00:05:01.600> works<00:05:01.840> brilliantly<00:05:02.110> from<00:05:02.620> for

00:05:03.120 --> 00:05:03.130 
this one works brilliantly from for

00:05:03.130 --> 00:05:05.070 
this one works brilliantly from for
samsung<00:05:03.520> and<00:05:04.090> obviously<00:05:04.389> samsung<00:05:04.870> and

00:05:05.070 --> 00:05:05.080 
samsung and obviously samsung and

00:05:05.080 --> 00:05:06.780 
samsung and obviously samsung and
Dropbox<00:05:05.410> to<00:05:05.560> getting<00:05:05.770> together<00:05:05.919> 12<00:05:06.280> you<00:05:06.430> 50

00:05:06.780 --> 00:05:06.790 
Dropbox to getting together 12 you 50

00:05:06.790 --> 00:05:09.270 
Dropbox to getting together 12 you 50
gigabytes<00:05:07.000> for<00:05:07.270> free<00:05:07.600> for<00:05:08.139> two<00:05:08.290> years<00:05:08.590> that's

00:05:09.270 --> 00:05:09.280 
gigabytes for free for two years that's

00:05:09.280 --> 00:05:10.860 
gigabytes for free for two years that's
probably<00:05:09.460> worth<00:05:09.700> doing<00:05:09.940> so<00:05:10.660> I'm<00:05:10.720> going<00:05:10.750> to

00:05:10.860 --> 00:05:10.870 
probably worth doing so I'm going to

00:05:10.870 --> 00:05:12.719 
probably worth doing so I'm going to
click<00:05:10.960> skip<00:05:11.290> on<00:05:11.470> that<00:05:11.620> one<00:05:11.740> but<00:05:12.460> if<00:05:12.550> you<00:05:12.639> have

00:05:12.719 --> 00:05:12.729 
click skip on that one but if you have

00:05:12.729 --> 00:05:14.610 
click skip on that one but if you have
got<00:05:12.910> one<00:05:13.060> you<00:05:13.330> can<00:05:13.450> obviously<00:05:13.510> just<00:05:13.870> sign<00:05:14.440> in

00:05:14.610 --> 00:05:14.620 
got one you can obviously just sign in

00:05:14.620 --> 00:05:18.480 
got one you can obviously just sign in
so<00:05:14.740> it<00:05:15.520> now<00:05:15.760> runs<00:05:16.000> you<00:05:16.180> through<00:05:16.210> and<00:05:17.310> the<00:05:18.310> key

00:05:18.480 --> 00:05:18.490 
so it now runs you through and the key

00:05:18.490 --> 00:05:20.760 
so it now runs you through and the key
features<00:05:18.940> on<00:05:19.210> this<00:05:19.330> one<00:05:19.539> and<00:05:20.229> what<00:05:20.470> you<00:05:20.560> want
