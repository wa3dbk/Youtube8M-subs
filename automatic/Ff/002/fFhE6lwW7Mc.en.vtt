any of the slag experiment my notes
because<00:02:22.840> I<00:02:22.900> think<00:02:23.410> when<00:02:23.770> you<00:02:23.890> don't<00:02:24.130> collect

00:02:24.420 --> 00:02:24.430 
because I think when you don't collect

00:02:24.430 --> 00:02:27.750 
because I think when you don't collect
any<00:02:24.780> more<00:02:25.780> legendary<00:02:26.530> loot<00:02:26.830> midgets<00:02:27.040> actually

spawn so yeah I would advise not

00:02:30.490 --> 00:02:34.470 
spawn so yeah I would advise not
collecting<00:02:31.330> any<00:02:31.450> but<00:02:31.810> if<00:02:32.050> you<00:02:32.170> do<00:02:32.350> wherever<00:02:33.480> so

00:02:34.470 --> 00:02:34.480
