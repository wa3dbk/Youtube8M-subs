where his hand speed isn't much of a

00:05:38.720 --> 00:05:40.960

every time he gets close he has to go to
the<00:05:56.570> body<00:05:56.870> um<00:05:57.790> he<00:05:58.790> doesn't<00:05:59.120> want<00:05:59.270> to<00:05:59.300> be<00:05:59.450> much

00:05:59.650 --> 00:05:59.660

00:06:04.380 --> 00:06:04.390 
to make moreno continuously move and

00:06:04.390 --> 00:06:07.030 
to make moreno continuously move and
just<00:06:05.390> go<00:06:05.540> for<00:06:05.720> the<00:06:05.810> knockout<00:06:05.979> lading<00:06:06.979> the

00:06:07.030 --> 00:06:07.040 
just go for the knockout lading the

00:06:07.040 --> 00:06:08.890 
just go for the knockout lading the
fight<00:06:07.280> scopes<00:06:07.850> of<00:06:07.970> the<00:06:08.060> body<00:06:08.240> every<00:06:08.570> chance<00:06:08.810> he

00:06:08.890 --> 00:06:08.900 
fight scopes of the body every chance he

00:06:08.900 --> 00:06:12.610 
fight scopes of the body every chance he
gets<00:06:09.140> um<00:06:09.860> and<00:06:10.310> I<00:06:10.430> think<00:06:10.700> that<00:06:10.940> and<00:06:11.560> pretty<00:06:12.560> much

00:06:12.610 --> 00:06:12.620 
gets um and I think that and pretty much

00:06:12.620 --> 00:06:14.680 
gets um and I think that and pretty much
just<00:06:12.890> throws<00:06:13.310> with<00:06:13.610> hearts<00:06:14.030> with<00:06:14.240> shots<00:06:14.510> to

00:06:14.680 --> 00:06:14.690 
just throws with hearts with shots to

00:06:14.690 --> 00:06:16.960 
just throws with hearts with shots to
the<00:06:14.720> body<00:06:14.960> and<00:06:15.470> I<00:06:16.070> think<00:06:16.310> he<00:06:16.430> can<00:06:16.580> very<00:06:16.910> well

00:06:16.960 --> 00:06:16.970 
the body and I think he can very well

00:06:16.970 --> 00:06:19.480 
the body and I think he can very well
win<00:06:17.330> if<00:06:17.570> he<00:06:17.720> can<00:06:17.930> get<00:06:18.440> close<00:06:18.740> to<00:06:18.950> him<00:06:19.040> if<00:06:19.130> he<00:06:19.310> can

00:06:19.480 --> 00:06:19.490 
win if he can get close to him if he can

00:06:19.490 --> 00:06:22.120 
win if he can get close to him if he can
touch<00:06:19.910> Moreno<00:06:20.410> you<00:06:21.410> know<00:06:21.500> if<00:06:21.590> he<00:06:21.740> can<00:06:21.890> touch

shots he's gonna have to make Moreno

00:06:28.729 --> 00:06:30.880 
shots he's gonna have to make Moreno
miss<00:06:29.090> so<00:06:29.390> that<00:06:29.570> he<00:06:29.870> gets<00:06:30.020> tired<00:06:30.350> late<00:06:30.710> in<00:06:30.830> the

00:06:30.880 --> 00:06:30.890 
miss so that he gets tired late in the

00:06:30.890 --> 00:06:31.360 
miss so that he gets tired late in the
fight

00:06:31.360 --> 00:06:31.370 
fight

00:06:31.370 --> 00:06:33.219 
fight
which<00:06:31.699> will<00:06:32.000> make<00:06:32.030> him<00:06:32.270> vulnerable<00:06:32.600> to<00:06:33.110> the

00:06:33.219 --> 00:06:33.229 
which will make him vulnerable to the

00:06:33.229 --> 00:06:35.260 
which will make him vulnerable to the
knockout<00:06:33.650> and<00:06:33.919> that's<00:06:34.669> pretty<00:06:34.850> much<00:06:34.970> what

00:06:35.260 --> 00:06:35.270 
knockout and that's pretty much what

00:06:35.270 --> 00:06:37.000 
knockout and that's pretty much what
that<00:06:35.419> style<00:06:35.750> does<00:06:36.050> you<00:06:36.410> you<00:06:36.680> know<00:06:36.770> it<00:06:36.860> makes

00:06:37.000 --> 00:06:37.010 
that style does you you know it makes

00:06:37.010 --> 00:06:39.420 
that style does you you know it makes
opponent<00:06:37.669> very<00:06:38.120> vulnerable<00:06:38.449> to<00:06:38.930> the<00:06:39.020> knockout

00:06:39.420 --> 00:06:39.430 
opponent very vulnerable to the knockout

00:06:39.430 --> 00:06:42.939 
opponent very vulnerable to the knockout
so<00:06:40.449> pretty<00:06:41.449> much<00:06:41.540> I<00:06:41.870> think<00:06:41.900> that<00:06:42.290> darchinyan

00:06:42.939 --> 00:06:42.949 
so pretty much I think that darchinyan

00:06:42.949 --> 00:06:45.400 
so pretty much I think that darchinyan
is<00:06:43.070> going<00:06:43.220> to<00:06:43.280> have<00:06:43.400> to<00:06:43.520> make<00:06:44.410> marengo

00:06:45.400 --> 00:06:45.410 
is going to have to make marengo

00:06:45.410 --> 00:06:48.250 
is going to have to make marengo
vulnerable<00:06:46.130> to<00:06:46.310> the<00:06:46.430> knockout<00:06:46.850> and<00:06:47.150> the<00:06:48.080> way

00:06:48.250 --> 00:06:48.260 
vulnerable to the knockout and the way

00:06:48.260 --> 00:06:49.420 
vulnerable to the knockout and the way
they<00:06:48.410> make<00:06:48.590> and<00:06:48.770> vulnerable<00:06:49.160> to<00:06:49.340> the

00:06:49.420 --> 00:06:49.430 
they make and vulnerable to the

00:06:49.430 --> 00:06:51.010 
they make and vulnerable to the
Knockouts<00:06:49.820> continuously<00:06:50.360> make<00:06:50.630> them<00:06:50.810> work

00:06:51.010 --> 00:06:51.020 
Knockouts continuously make them work

00:06:51.020 --> 00:06:53.770 
Knockouts continuously make them work
make<00:06:51.860> them<00:06:52.010> work<00:06:52.190> make<00:06:52.460> a<00:06:52.490> Miss<00:06:52.850> go<00:06:53.510> to<00:06:53.570> the

00:06:53.770 --> 00:06:53.780 
make them work make a Miss go to the

00:06:53.780 --> 00:06:56.530 
make them work make a Miss go to the
body<00:06:53.990> every<00:06:54.410> chance<00:06:54.710> that<00:06:54.800> you<00:06:55.040> get<00:06:55.540> take

00:06:56.530 --> 00:06:56.540

00:06:58.930 --> 00:06:58.940 
those legs away take the legs away take

00:06:58.940 --> 00:07:01.750 
those legs away take the legs away take
his<00:06:59.090> energy<00:06:59.479> away<00:06:59.720> and<00:07:00.710> on<00:07:00.949> calories<00:07:01.610> from

time to time make him respect his power
and<00:07:04.280> I<00:07:05.270> think<00:07:05.479> very<00:07:05.750> well<00:07:06.050> very<00:07:06.500> much<00:07:06.740> he<00:07:06.919> can

00:07:07.060 --> 00:07:07.070 
and I think very well very much he can

00:07:07.070 --> 00:07:09.850 
and I think very well very much he can
win<00:07:07.220> this<00:07:07.340> fight<00:07:07.550> just<00:07:07.760> based<00:07:08.030> on<00:07:08.210> that<00:07:08.680> so<00:07:09.680> who

00:07:09.850 --> 00:07:09.860 
win this fight just based on that so who

00:07:09.860 --> 00:07:11.740 
win this fight just based on that so who
I<00:07:09.919> think<00:07:10.039> is<00:07:10.310> going<00:07:10.340> to<00:07:10.520> win<00:07:10.550> this<00:07:10.820> way<00:07:11.030> even

00:07:11.740 --> 00:07:11.750 
I think is going to win this way even

00:07:11.750 --> 00:07:13.390 
I think is going to win this way even
though<00:07:12.020> I<00:07:12.050> think<00:07:12.440> that<00:07:12.590> this<00:07:12.919> could<00:07:12.979> be<00:07:13.370> a

00:07:13.390 --> 00:07:13.400 
though I think that this could be a

00:07:13.400 --> 00:07:15.010 
though I think that this could be a
fight<00:07:13.699> from<00:07:13.880> vic<00:07:14.090> darchinyan<00:07:14.240> I<00:07:14.720> think<00:07:14.930> he

00:07:15.010 --> 00:07:15.020 
fight from vic darchinyan I think he

00:07:15.020 --> 00:07:16.360 
fight from vic darchinyan I think he
could<00:07:15.139> very<00:07:15.320> well<00:07:15.410> win<00:07:15.650> this<00:07:15.710> fight<00:07:16.039> I<00:07:16.070> think

00:07:16.360 --> 00:07:16.370 
could very well win this fight I think

00:07:16.370 --> 00:07:18.040 
could very well win this fight I think
I'm<00:07:16.520> gonna<00:07:16.639> go<00:07:16.729> in<00:07:17.000> Selma<00:07:17.419> rebel<00:07:17.780> because<00:07:17.840> he

00:07:18.040 --> 00:07:18.050 
I'm gonna go in Selma rebel because he

00:07:18.050 --> 00:07:20.560 
I'm gonna go in Selma rebel because he
has<00:07:18.169> a<00:07:18.199> lot<00:07:18.380> more<00:07:18.440> skill<00:07:18.919> and<00:07:19.669> I<00:07:19.729> think<00:07:20.000> that<00:07:20.240> I

00:07:20.560 --> 00:07:20.570 
has a lot more skill and I think that I

00:07:20.570 --> 00:07:22.810 
has a lot more skill and I think that I
think<00:07:21.560> that<00:07:21.710> when<00:07:21.889> he<00:07:21.949> finds<00:07:22.340> he's<00:07:22.580> going<00:07:22.729> to

00:07:22.810 --> 00:07:22.820 
think that when he finds he's going to

00:07:22.820 --> 00:07:24.279 
think that when he finds he's going to
be<00:07:22.880> able<00:07:23.030> to<00:07:23.120> find<00:07:23.300> his<00:07:23.510> rhythm<00:07:23.660> and<00:07:23.990> win<00:07:24.139> this

00:07:24.279 --> 00:07:24.289 
be able to find his rhythm and win this

00:07:24.289 --> 00:07:27.100 
be able to find his rhythm and win this
fight<00:07:24.560> on<00:07:25.400> a<00:07:25.460> decision<00:07:25.850> on<00:07:26.180> the<00:07:26.300> scorecards<00:07:26.960> I

00:07:27.100 --> 00:07:27.110 
fight on a decision on the scorecards I

00:07:27.110 --> 00:07:30.189 
fight on a decision on the scorecards I
think<00:07:27.860> that<00:07:28.010> was<00:07:28.160> quick<00:07:28.460> hand<00:07:28.729> speed<00:07:29.110> just<00:07:30.110> the

00:07:30.189 --> 00:07:30.199 
think that was quick hand speed just the

00:07:30.199 --> 00:07:33.580 
think that was quick hand speed just the
way<00:07:30.520> either<00:07:31.520> way<00:07:31.760> he<00:07:32.030> utilizes<00:07:32.570> his<00:07:32.810> tools<00:07:33.380> in

00:07:33.580 --> 00:07:33.590 
way either way he utilizes his tools in

00:07:33.590 --> 00:07:35.379 
way either way he utilizes his tools in
the<00:07:33.680> ring<00:07:33.889> I<00:07:34.160> think<00:07:34.820> will<00:07:34.940> be<00:07:35.060> too<00:07:35.210> much<00:07:35.330> for

00:07:35.379 --> 00:07:35.389 
the ring I think will be too much for

00:07:35.389 --> 00:07:38.560 
the ring I think will be too much for
Darchinyan<00:07:36.110> so<00:07:36.800> I<00:07:36.830> think<00:07:36.950> that<00:07:37.340> if<00:07:38.180> he<00:07:38.360> can

00:07:38.560 --> 00:07:38.570 
Darchinyan so I think that if he can

00:07:38.570 --> 00:07:40.570 
Darchinyan so I think that if he can
find<00:07:38.990> a<00:07:39.139> way<00:07:39.169> that<00:07:39.530> pretty<00:07:39.740> much<00:07:39.860> pretty<00:07:40.460> much

00:07:40.570 --> 00:07:40.580 
find a way that pretty much pretty much

00:07:40.580 --> 00:07:42.520 
find a way that pretty much pretty much
neutralized<00:07:41.270> the<00:07:41.539> arch<00:07:41.810> enemy<00:07:42.080> attack<00:07:42.349> by

00:07:42.520 --> 00:07:42.530

00:07:42.530 --> 00:07:44.650

using his hand speed angles and very up
his<00:07:44.810> punches<00:07:45.289> I<00:07:45.440> think<00:07:46.220> he<00:07:46.340> could<00:07:46.460> very<00:07:46.639> well

00:07:46.750 --> 00:07:46.760
