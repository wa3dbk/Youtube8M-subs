alloy tripod I actually have my t2i

00:00:41.010 --> 00:00:43.790 
alloy tripod I actually have my t2i
attached<00:00:41.550> to<00:00:41.789> it<00:00:41.910> already<00:00:42.140> to<00:00:43.140> the<00:00:43.440> head<00:00:43.680> of

00:00:43.790 --> 00:00:43.800 
attached to it already to the head of

00:00:43.800 --> 00:00:46.459 
attached to it already to the head of
the<00:00:43.890> tripod<00:00:44.280> it<00:00:44.699> is<00:00:45.270> not<00:00:45.449> a<00:00:45.480> detachable<00:00:45.960> head

00:00:48.529 --> 00:00:48.539 
which is a little bit of a downside but

00:00:48.539 --> 00:00:50.750 
which is a little bit of a downside but
again<00:00:48.840> because<00:00:49.289> this<00:00:49.559> tripod<00:00:50.010> is<00:00:50.250> so<00:00:50.489> light

00:01:40.070 --> 00:01:40.080 
of movement this is more of a stationary

normally have locks on them that

00:01:47.070 --> 00:01:49.610 
normally have locks on them that
basically<00:01:47.610> flip<00:01:48.030> you<00:01:48.870> pull<00:01:49.290> them<00:01:49.470> out<00:01:49.560> and

00:01:49.610 --> 00:01:49.620 
basically flip you pull them out and

00:01:49.620 --> 00:01:51.040

00:01:51.040 --> 00:01:51.050 
then you lock them back in place

00:01:51.050 --> 00:01:53.090 
then you lock them back in place
depending<00:01:52.050> on<00:01:52.140> how<00:01:52.260> many<00:01:52.320> segments<00:01:52.860> they<00:01:52.950> have

00:01:53.090 --> 00:01:53.100 
depending on how many segments they have

00:01:53.100 --> 00:01:54.800 
depending on how many segments they have
this<00:01:53.310> particular<00:01:53.790> one<00:01:53.940> has<00:01:54.120> three<00:01:54.390> segments

00:01:54.800 --> 00:01:54.810 
this particular one has three segments

00:01:54.810 --> 00:01:56.990 
this particular one has three segments
but<00:01:55.380> the<00:01:55.920> cool<00:01:56.130> part<00:01:56.310> is<00:01:56.370> these<00:01:56.670> are<00:01:56.880> just

00:01:56.990 --> 00:01:57.000 
but the cool part is these are just

00:01:57.000 --> 00:02:00.500 
but the cool part is these are just
twist<00:01:57.420> and<00:01:58.010> then<00:01:59.010> extend<00:01:59.550> right<00:02:00.060> you<00:02:00.330> just

00:02:00.500 --> 00:02:00.510 
twist and then extend right you just

some still photography and to test out

00:02:14.370 --> 00:02:16.880 
some still photography and to test out
the<00:02:14.489> stability<00:02:15.030> this<00:02:15.750> works<00:02:16.049> out<00:02:16.290> well<00:02:16.560> as

00:02:16.880 --> 00:02:16.890 
the stability this works out well as

00:02:16.890 --> 00:02:17.420 
the stability this works out well as
long<00:02:17.099> as

00:02:17.420 --> 00:02:17.430 
long as

00:02:17.430 --> 00:02:20.479

my<00:02:17.609> t2i<00:02:17.969> was<00:02:18.329> pretty<00:02:18.569> much<00:02:18.750> at<00:02:19.409> the<00:02:20.069> center<00:02:20.099> of

00:02:20.479 --> 00:02:20.489 
my t2i was pretty much at the center of

00:02:20.489 --> 00:02:23.599 
my t2i was pretty much at the center of
the<00:02:20.760> tripod<00:02:21.180> or<00:02:21.739> the<00:02:22.739> cold<00:02:22.980> part<00:02:23.129> another<00:02:23.280> cool

the tripod or the cold part another cool
part<00:02:23.819> about<00:02:23.879> this<00:02:24.150> is<00:02:24.209> once<00:02:24.599> these<00:02:24.810> legs<00:02:25.079> are

00:02:25.250 --> 00:02:25.260 
part about this is once these legs are

00:02:25.260 --> 00:02:29.059 
part about this is once these legs are
extended<00:02:25.500> I<00:02:27.319> can't<00:02:28.319> really<00:02:28.439> extend<00:02:28.859> it<00:02:28.950> all

00:02:29.059 --> 00:02:29.069

00:02:33.740 --> 00:02:33.750 
extended you can tilt with this center

00:02:33.750 --> 00:02:39.429 
extended you can tilt with this center
column<00:02:34.230> so<00:02:35.069> that<00:02:37.069> you<00:02:38.069> can<00:02:38.250> adjust<00:02:38.400> and<00:02:38.939> take

shots<00:03:21.870> if<00:03:22.019> I'm<00:03:22.139> doing<00:03:22.349> an<00:03:22.440> interview<00:03:22.829> or

00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:23.010 
shots if I'm doing an interview or

00:03:23.010 --> 00:03:26.089 
shots if I'm doing an interview or
anything<00:03:23.790> like<00:03:23.819> that<00:03:24.440> overall<00:03:25.440> quality<00:03:25.769> was

00:03:26.089 --> 00:03:26.099 
anything like that overall quality was

00:03:26.099 --> 00:03:27.710 
anything like that overall quality was
great<00:03:26.370> didn't<00:03:26.819> find<00:03:26.970> any<00:03:27.180> issues<00:03:27.599> whatsoever

00:03:27.710 --> 00:03:27.720 
great didn't find any issues whatsoever

00:03:27.720 --> 00:03:29.689 
great didn't find any issues whatsoever
the<00:03:28.530> only<00:03:28.829> thing<00:03:29.010> is<00:03:29.129> with<00:03:29.310> the<00:03:29.430> maximum

00:03:29.689 --> 00:03:29.699 
the only thing is with the maximum

00:03:29.699 --> 00:03:31.580 
the only thing is with the maximum
weight<00:03:29.970> capacity<00:03:30.000> being<00:03:30.659> four<00:03:30.930> pounds<00:03:31.379> it

00:03:31.580 --> 00:03:31.590 
weight capacity being four pounds it

00:03:31.590 --> 00:03:34.219 
weight capacity being four pounds it
really<00:03:31.829> is<00:03:31.979> four<00:03:32.280> pounds<00:03:32.729> at<00:03:32.879> certain<00:03:33.780> angles

00:03:34.219 --> 00:03:34.229 
really is four pounds at certain angles

00:03:34.229 --> 00:03:38.599 
really is four pounds at certain angles
so<00:03:34.739> again<00:03:35.370> if<00:03:35.790> this<00:03:36.569> is<00:03:37.069> completely<00:03:38.069> locked<00:03:38.400> in

00:03:38.599 --> 00:03:38.609 
so again if this is completely locked in

00:03:38.609 --> 00:03:42.500 
so again if this is completely locked in
place<00:03:38.790> in<00:03:40.579> where<00:03:41.579> the<00:03:41.669> camera<00:03:41.939> is<00:03:42.000> directly

00:03:42.500 --> 00:03:42.510 
place in where the camera is directly

00:03:42.510 --> 00:03:44.179 
place in where the camera is directly
putting<00:03:42.810> weight<00:03:43.049> in<00:03:43.199> the<00:03:43.319> center<00:03:43.620> column<00:03:43.799> or

00:03:44.179 --> 00:03:44.189 
putting weight in the center column or

00:03:44.189 --> 00:03:46.909 
putting weight in the center column or
when<00:03:44.970> it's<00:03:45.120> completely<00:03:45.689> the<00:03:46.349> opposite

00:03:46.909 --> 00:03:46.919 
when it's completely the opposite

00:03:46.919 --> 00:03:48.140 
when it's completely the opposite
direction<00:03:47.040> when<00:03:47.400> you<00:03:47.489> fold<00:03:47.669> it<00:03:47.790> all<00:03:47.909> the<00:03:48.060> way

00:03:48.140 --> 00:03:48.150 
direction when you fold it all the way

00:03:48.150 --> 00:03:50.300 
direction when you fold it all the way
down<00:03:48.359> those<00:03:48.959> are<00:03:49.139> good<00:03:49.349> but<00:03:49.620> if<00:03:49.739> you<00:03:49.859> try<00:03:50.040> to<00:03:50.129> do

00:03:50.300 --> 00:03:50.310 
down those are good but if you try to do

00:03:50.310 --> 00:03:52.420 
down those are good but if you try to do
an<00:03:50.430> angle<00:03:50.879> shot<00:03:51.120> if<00:03:51.269> you<00:03:51.389> try<00:03:51.599> to<00:03:51.629> do<00:03:51.900> something

00:03:52.420 --> 00:03:52.430 
an angle shot if you try to do something

00:03:52.430 --> 00:03:56.210 
an angle shot if you try to do something
with<00:03:53.430> a<00:03:53.489> heavier<00:03:54.060> camera<00:03:54.780> at<00:03:55.019> an<00:03:55.650> angle<00:03:56.040> let's

00:03:56.210 --> 00:03:56.220 
with a heavier camera at an angle let's

00:03:56.220 --> 00:03:58.909 
with a heavier camera at an angle let's

review<00:04:30.210> piece<00:04:31.200> the<00:04:32.130> bumper<00:04:32.969> portion<00:04:33.570> onto<00:04:34.050> the

00:04:34.129 --> 00:04:34.139 
review piece the bumper portion onto the

00:04:34.139 --> 00:04:36.050 
review piece the bumper portion onto the
case<00:04:34.349> so<00:04:34.950> it<00:04:34.979> does<00:04:35.250> make<00:04:35.279> it<00:04:35.610> a<00:04:35.700> little<00:04:35.729> bit

00:04:36.050 --> 00:04:36.060 
case so it does make it a little bit

00:04:36.060 --> 00:04:38.330 
case so it does make it a little bit
thicker<00:04:36.659> with<00:04:36.990> regards<00:04:37.409> to<00:04:37.500> this<00:04:37.919> direction

00:04:38.330 --> 00:04:38.340 
thicker with regards to this direction

00:04:38.340 --> 00:04:43.729 
thicker with regards to this direction
but<00:04:39.800> not<00:04:40.800> that<00:04:40.979> much<00:04:41.159> that<00:04:41.340> you<00:04:41.430> would<00:04:41.520> notice
