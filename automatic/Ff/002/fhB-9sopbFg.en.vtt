criticism<00:05:11.400> with<00:05:11.790> the<00:05:11.880> game<00:05:12.060> is<00:05:12.210> that<00:05:12.240> I<00:05:12.390> don't

00:05:12.560 --> 00:05:12.570 
criticism with the game is that I don't

00:05:12.570 --> 00:05:13.760 
criticism with the game is that I don't
think<00:05:12.720> it<00:05:12.840> does<00:05:12.960> enough<00:05:13.260> with<00:05:13.380> the<00:05:13.470> Rolling

00:05:13.760 --> 00:05:13.770 
think it does enough with the Rolling

00:05:13.770 --> 00:05:15.200 
think it does enough with the Rolling
Thunder<00:05:13.800> formula<00:05:14.520> to<00:05:14.640> distinguish<00:05:15.090> it<00:05:15.180> from

00:05:15.200 --> 00:05:15.210 
Thunder formula to distinguish it from

00:05:15.210 --> 00:05:16.700 
Thunder formula to distinguish it from
that<00:05:15.510> game<00:05:15.750> or<00:05:15.930> codename<00:05:16.290> Viper

00:05:16.700 --> 00:05:16.710 
that game or codename Viper

00:05:16.710 --> 00:05:18.590 
that game or codename Viper
now<00:05:17.220> if<00:05:17.310> they<00:05:17.400> had<00:05:17.520> added<00:05:17.820> a<00:05:17.910> few<00:05:18.090> more<00:05:18.300> tasks

00:05:18.590 --> 00:05:18.600 
now if they had added a few more tasks

00:05:18.600 --> 00:05:20.990 
now if they had added a few more tasks
in<00:05:18.870> the<00:05:18.960> game<00:05:19.200> or<00:05:19.800> game<00:05:20.010> use<00:05:20.220> items<00:05:20.550> to<00:05:20.669> collect

00:05:20.990 --> 00:05:21.000 
in the game or game use items to collect

00:05:21.000 --> 00:05:23.330 
in the game or game use items to collect
or<00:05:21.270> things<00:05:21.510> to<00:05:21.600> do<00:05:21.900> then<00:05:22.410> maybe<00:05:22.740> it<00:05:23.070> would<00:05:23.250> have

00:05:23.330 --> 00:05:23.340 
or things to do then maybe it would have

00:05:23.340 --> 00:05:24.860 
or things to do then maybe it would have
been<00:05:23.400> a<00:05:23.550> better<00:05:23.790> game<00:05:24.120> because<00:05:24.510> at<00:05:24.630> least<00:05:24.720> you
