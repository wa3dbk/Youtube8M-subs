 a little more awake around the tired eyes 

00:01:37.840 --> 00:01:41.680
 I use the p2 

00:01:39.670 --> 00:01:43.660
 if in empire as a pencil just in the 

00:01:41.680 --> 00:01:45.640
 Augenwinkel and also under the 

00:01:43.660 --> 00:01:48.480
 eyebrow so that your whole eye is easy 

00:01:45.640 --> 00:01:48.480
 have opened a lot 

00:01:57.899 --> 00:02:02.289
 then I use of rossmann 

00:02:00.039 --> 00:02:04.749
 the eyelash curler and afterwards of professionals 

00:02:02.289 --> 00:02:06.399
 the giant mascara, too 

00:02:04.749 --> 00:02:08.500
 waterproof and really holds one 

00:02:06.399 --> 00:02:10.090
 warm day out even if your a bit fritz 

00:02:08.500 --> 00:02:12.750
 the mascara really stays where it is 

00:02:10.090 --> 00:02:12.750
 should be 

00:02:23.930 --> 00:02:29.450
 I use it to warm up the face 

00:02:26.510 --> 00:02:31.250
 from alterra the 02 sanchez browser and 

00:02:29.450 --> 00:02:33.489
 the brush from the current selection of 

00:02:31.250 --> 00:02:33.489
 Luegallee 

00:02:37.860 --> 00:02:42.730
 and use the eyes a bit too stressed 

00:02:40.780 --> 00:02:45.870
 I 'll deal in that as eyebrows 

00:02:42.730 --> 00:02:45.870
 the color 0 2 brown 

00:02:48.379 --> 00:02:51.810
 it continues with the hair and that 

00:02:50.640 --> 00:02:53.550
 I really do a very simple 

00:02:51.810 --> 00:02:55.680
 Look and you take it easy 

00:02:53.550 --> 00:02:57.830
 have a strand of opening and 

00:02:55.680 --> 00:02:57.830
 perhaps 

00:03:02.360 --> 00:03:07.020
 First we attach the surface with 

00:03:04.800 --> 00:03:08.730
 a hair tie but that's not 

00:03:07.020 --> 00:03:10.650
 so important what final rubber main thing 

00:03:08.730 --> 00:03:12.660
 The lichen stays that way first and 

00:03:10.650 --> 00:03:14.370
 then the at our ponies and 

00:03:12.660 --> 00:03:15.960
 Just do it with the surface one way 

00:03:14.370 --> 00:03:18.000
 we just have the ponies of ours 

00:03:15.960 --> 00:03:21.740
 face but still that's easy 

00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:21.740
 not so boring crank back 

00:03:26.120 --> 00:03:28.330
 the 

00:03:32.160 --> 00:03:35.980
 It continues with the outfit and indeed 

00:03:34.360 --> 00:03:38.890
 we will not be in this outfit for sure 

00:03:35.980 --> 00:03:40.120
 Going to school and that if we in 

00:03:38.890 --> 00:03:42.070
 this car to school 

00:03:40.120 --> 00:03:43.690
 I really ask a very simple one 

00:03:42.070 --> 00:03:44.890
 Outfit that's really funny 

00:03:43.690 --> 00:03:47.130
 Share but I find them together 

00:03:44.890 --> 00:03:49.870
 really beautifull 

00:03:47.130 --> 00:03:52.360
 In spite of the question, Zara is the one 

00:03:49.870 --> 00:03:53.770

00:04:05.590 --> 00:04:11.970
