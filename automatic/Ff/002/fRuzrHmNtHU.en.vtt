00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.840
 yes hello and welcome tsum 

00:00:02.250 --> 00:00:11.370
 a tutorial where I show you now 

00:00:03.840 --> 00:00:13.710
 how to bring for minecraft 1.4.2011 

00:00:11.370 --> 00:00:15.809
 4.3 or 1.5 that works too 

00:00:13.710 --> 00:00:18.480
 just like you have a server for it 

00:00:15.809 --> 00:00:24.740
 created and yes there is now easy 

00:00:18.480 --> 00:00:29.279
 first on www.mainpost.de 

00:00:24.740 --> 00:00:30.900
 and yes then go here on download 

00:00:29.279 --> 00:00:31.850
 play minecraft is downloadable here 

00:00:30.900 --> 00:00:34.860
 you click 

00:00:31.850 --> 00:00:40.620
 then you click on team server 

00:00:34.860 --> 00:00:43.260
 then save complex to file and 

00:00:40.620 --> 00:00:47.129
 then you create a new one 

00:00:43.260 --> 00:00:49.710
 Folder you then eg server calls that 

00:00:47.129 --> 00:00:51.420
 calls whole piano and there you pull 

00:00:49.710 --> 00:00:53.969
 then this team server point excel 

00:00:51.420 --> 00:00:58.670
 in and then started the team 

00:00:53.969 --> 00:01:00.899
 to choose buzeks simply lead out here 

00:00:58.670 --> 00:01:02.699
 and now there is little moment 

00:01:00.899 --> 00:01:04.260
 now the server starts it had to first 

00:01:02.699 --> 00:01:08.640
 wait times of the generated the world 

00:01:04.260 --> 00:01:09.840
 now takes a little moment and 

00:01:08.640 --> 00:01:11.850
 where you can actually now 

00:01:09.840 --> 00:01:16.050
 First, just stop here on the ixs 

00:01:11.850 --> 00:01:18.600
 first click and wait 

00:01:16.050 --> 00:01:20.940
 it takes until he closes and then 

00:01:18.600 --> 00:01:22.410
 you go here on server properties and 

00:01:20.940 --> 00:01:24.480
 Now you make a right click and 

00:01:22.410 --> 00:01:25.760
 click on edit this should be included 

00:01:24.480 --> 00:01:29.130
 do not stand you 

00:01:25.760 --> 00:01:30.630
 you go with open 

00:01:29.130 --> 00:01:32.460
 then you will be able to get the editor out of it 

00:01:30.630 --> 00:01:33.869
 it also quite simply among other things 

00:01:32.460 --> 00:01:35.399
 programs, the editor should get up 

00:01:33.869 --> 00:01:36.270
 or you can also wordpad you can 

00:01:35.399 --> 00:01:38.390
 also easy to take 

00:01:36.270 --> 00:01:41.700
 now I do not care about this 

00:01:38.390 --> 00:01:43.979
 Japan still experiences the command 

00:01:41.700 --> 00:01:46.740
 wordpad open the will is indeed on any 

00:01:43.979 --> 00:01:49.789
 windows pc on it but i would currently 

00:01:46.740 --> 00:01:56.850
 open with the normal editor 

00:01:49.789 --> 00:01:58.110
 and yes, now you give it here where 

00:01:56.850 --> 00:02:00.659
 we need that too right now 

00:01:58.110 --> 00:02:01.920
 hamashima so for the ip now 

00:02:00.659 --> 00:02:03.030
 are you going to put me in the way? 

00:02:01.920 --> 00:02:05.880
 will put description 

00:02:03.030 --> 00:02:10.039
 this is the link to karachi to that 

00:02:05.880 --> 00:02:12.239
 program and that you download yourself 

00:02:10.039 --> 00:02:14.340
 go to the link and click on to 

00:02:12.239 --> 00:02:18.420
 download installs this easy and 

00:02:14.340 --> 00:02:20.660
 then you have to soup in anarchy and 

00:02:18.420 --> 00:02:20.660
 then 

00:02:20.840 --> 00:02:25.730
 then their following think the thereon 

00:02:22.610 --> 00:02:27.910
 network you had it on and goes on 

00:02:25.730 --> 00:02:30.319
 Create a new network network 

00:02:27.910 --> 00:02:35.319
 Now you have some idea 

00:02:30.319 --> 00:02:37.730
 for example, server 14 2 test wore so 

00:02:35.319 --> 00:02:40.430
 for example and then any password 

00:02:37.730 --> 00:02:42.349
 I would take 135 and then rather 

00:02:40.430 --> 00:02:43.970
 put this and your friends on the now 

00:02:42.349 --> 00:02:46.099
 your server forward to it also need 

00:02:43.970 --> 00:02:47.959
 ramachi and then have to network 

00:02:46.099 --> 00:02:50.180
 Click to join an existing network 

00:02:47.959 --> 00:02:52.430
 then these networks also go the 

00:02:50.180 --> 00:02:53.510
 one of you and also the password and 

00:02:52.430 --> 00:02:56.480
 click on join 

00:02:53.510 --> 00:03:00.680
 then you come on the server where he is 

00:02:56.480 --> 00:03:02.660
 the ip 5.1 81 oh gosh is already 

00:03:00.680 --> 00:03:04.940
 my before by the ip the here 

00:03:02.660 --> 00:03:08.299
 there is an existent with me that is now 

00:03:04.940 --> 00:03:10.670
 here 5.11 pressure and 4.44 o'clock stands one 

00:03:08.299 --> 00:03:12.379
 other ip but that would have to be in now 

00:03:10.670 --> 00:03:14.160
 enter the server properties at 

00:03:12.379 --> 00:03:17.150
 server ip 

00:03:14.160 --> 00:03:19.770
 Do you still know the app of 

00:03:17.150 --> 00:03:23.010
 Matthias me it 45 the previous year and 

00:03:19.770 --> 00:03:26.580
 18 14 points 

00:03:23.010 --> 00:03:28.470
 and then I could so with mode so ftd 

00:03:26.580 --> 00:03:31.670
 stands community server you can in 

00:03:28.470 --> 00:03:36.720
 choose any for the server eg 

00:03:31.670 --> 00:03:38.610
 server then the 1 the difficulty level 

00:03:36.720 --> 00:03:42.390
 simply two is normal 

00:03:38.610 --> 00:03:43.860
 3sat and 0 is peaceful and then you have to 

00:03:42.390 --> 00:03:45.990
 you also if you have this before 

00:03:43.860 --> 00:03:47.840
 you wanted monsters then you have to 

00:03:45.990 --> 00:03:54.600
 also continue 

00:03:47.840 --> 00:03:56.670
 so now where was this still the online mode 

00:03:54.600 --> 00:03:58.800
 you have to leave if you have one 

00:03:56.670 --> 00:04:01.230
 original minecraft version 8 if you 

00:03:58.800 --> 00:04:02.820
 top a cracked a sheep and know 

00:04:01.230 --> 00:04:05.160
 or your friends have some powers 

00:04:02.820 --> 00:04:10.080
 then you have to leave this trio 

00:04:05.160 --> 00:04:12.570
 and if you write down and yes that 

00:04:10.080 --> 00:04:14.340
 which actually already here 

00:04:12.570 --> 00:04:15.660
 still with maximum players you still have to 

00:04:14.340 --> 00:04:18.000
 any numbers like many players 

00:04:15.660 --> 00:04:21.359
 maximum on the server is allowed to 

00:04:18.000 --> 00:04:24.030
 Example 05 case my job is not like that 

00:04:21.359 --> 00:04:25.470
 good enough for the server but you can 

00:04:24.030 --> 00:04:27.300
 you decide then stores 

00:04:25.470 --> 00:04:29.760
 you can do it all off we can too 

00:04:27.300 --> 00:04:33.060
 control and use it to save 

00:04:29.760 --> 00:04:35.790
 then he pushed it all over at op sdxc 

00:04:33.060 --> 00:04:37.650
 you either open here with the 

00:04:35.790 --> 00:04:39.900
 editor or with wordpad or stop with 

00:04:37.650 --> 00:04:40.860
 notepad + + the program I will too 

00:04:39.900 --> 00:04:42.810
 again at the video description 

00:04:40.860 --> 00:04:47.250
 link and then you contribute 

00:04:42.810 --> 00:04:47.550
 the op s point text file of course 

00:04:47.250 --> 00:04:50.040
 do 

00:04:47.550 --> 00:04:52.350
 simply join her your name into 

00:04:50.040 --> 00:04:53.820
 game took their full rights 

00:04:52.350 --> 00:04:55.590
 The server but have strange people 

00:04:53.820 --> 00:04:57.120
 that should not just happen because 

00:04:55.590 --> 00:04:58.530
 otherwise to the full right over the server 

00:04:57.120 --> 00:05:00.330
 and, for example, you can reopen the open 

00:04:58.530 --> 00:05:01.919
 that we have no rights anymore and 

00:05:00.330 --> 00:05:06.210
 can stop changing the weather and 

00:05:01.919 --> 00:05:07.950
 time of day and everything was possible and 

00:05:06.210 --> 00:05:11.920
 then you just go to the minecraft 

00:05:07.950 --> 00:05:14.290
 server points again then up instead 

00:05:11.920 --> 00:05:16.210

00:05:17.770 --> 00:05:23.680
 clear the server 

00:05:19.020 --> 00:05:26.470

00:05:23.680 --> 00:05:28.510

00:05:28.510 --> 00:05:32.440
 to do 

00:05:29.550 --> 00:05:33.520
 and yes, that actually already with 

00:05:32.440 --> 00:05:39.040

00:05:39.040 --> 00:05:42.010
 server if he stops because far again 

00:05:40.840 --> 00:05:44.110
