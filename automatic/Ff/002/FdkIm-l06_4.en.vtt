00:01:44.350 --> 00:01:44.360 

00:01:44.360 --> 00:01:52.400 

take<00:01:45.360> these<00:01:45.540> along<00:01:49.490> anyway<00:01:50.750> I'll<00:01:51.750> give<00:01:52.380> a

00:01:52.400 --> 00:01:52.410 
take these along anyway I'll give a

00:01:52.410 --> 00:01:58.400 
take these along anyway I'll give a
little<00:01:52.740> demonstration<00:01:52.980> here<00:01:56.990> here's<00:01:57.990> the<00:01:58.170> car

00:01:58.400 --> 00:01:58.410 
little demonstration here here's the car

00:01:58.410 --> 00:02:03.620 
little demonstration here here's the car
I<00:01:59.990> think<00:02:00.990> it's<00:02:01.200> I<00:02:01.410> think<00:02:01.440> it's<00:02:01.740> unlocked<00:02:02.630> but

00:02:03.620 --> 00:02:03.630 
I think it's I think it's unlocked but

00:02:03.630 --> 00:02:07.100 
I think it's I think it's unlocked but
anyway<00:02:04.760> that's<00:02:05.760> locked<00:02:06.150> so<00:02:06.480> anyway<00:02:06.870> that

00:02:07.100 --> 00:02:07.110 
anyway that's locked so anyway that

00:02:07.110 --> 00:02:16.960 
anyway that's locked so anyway that
works<00:02:14.690> works<00:02:15.690> just<00:02:15.900> like<00:02:15.930> the<00:02:16.050> normal<00:02:16.320> remote

00:02:16.960 --> 00:02:16.970 
works works just like the normal remote

00:02:16.970 --> 00:02:20.300 
works works just like the normal remote
and<00:02:18.650> obviously<00:02:19.650> it's<00:02:19.800> open

00:02:20.300 --> 00:02:20.310 
and obviously it's open

00:02:20.310 --> 00:02:24.760 
and obviously it's open
and<00:02:20.490> of<00:02:20.580> course<00:02:20.820> you<00:02:20.940> can<00:02:21.120> also<00:02:21.990> use<00:02:22.290> this<00:02:22.560> to

00:02:24.760 --> 00:02:24.770 
and of course you can also use this to

00:02:24.770 --> 00:02:40.420 
and of course you can also use this to
lock<00:02:25.770> and<00:02:26.010> unlock<00:02:32.600> inside<00:02:33.600> now<00:02:37.100> and<00:02:38.100> obviously

00:02:40.420 --> 00:02:40.430 
lock and unlock inside now and obviously

00:02:40.430 --> 00:02:58.780 
lock and unlock inside now and obviously
show<00:02:41.430> that<00:02:41.640> it<00:02:41.730> works<00:02:46.730> cars<00:02:47.730> running

00:02:58.780 --> 00:02:58.790 

00:02:58.790 --> 00:03:02.450 

so<00:02:59.790> that<00:02:59.940> works<00:03:00.180> and<00:03:00.840> obviously<00:03:01.280> this<00:03:02.280> will

00:03:02.450 --> 00:03:02.460 
so that works and obviously this will

00:03:02.460 --> 00:03:09.710 
so that works and obviously this will
also<00:03:02.670> lock<00:03:03.300> the<00:03:03.330> glovebox<00:03:03.720> and<00:03:07.610> it<00:03:08.610> will<00:03:08.790> lock

00:03:09.710 --> 00:03:09.720 
also lock the glovebox and it will lock

00:03:09.720 --> 00:03:18.770 
also lock the glovebox and it will lock
the<00:03:09.960> trunk<00:03:16.190> okay<00:03:17.270> and<00:03:18.270> in<00:03:18.480> case<00:03:18.630> you're

00:03:18.770 --> 00:03:18.780
