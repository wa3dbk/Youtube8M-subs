00:00:40.250 --> 00:00:40.260 
first thing we're going to do is use the

00:00:40.260 --> 00:00:42.770 
first thing we're going to do is use the
stampers<00:00:40.890> big<00:00:41.130> brush<00:00:41.399> pen<00:00:41.640> number<00:00:41.940> 184<00:00:42.540> and

totally<00:00:43.560> cover<00:00:43.890> all<00:00:44.220> the<00:00:44.760> lines<00:00:44.970> on<00:00:45.210> this

00:00:45.320 --> 00:00:45.330 
totally cover all the lines on this

00:00:45.330 --> 00:00:47.360 
totally cover all the lines on this
acrylic<00:00:45.600> stamp<00:00:46.020> and<00:00:46.320> it's<00:00:46.560> pretty<00:00:46.860> clear<00:00:47.340> to

00:00:47.360 --> 00:00:47.370 
acrylic stamp and it's pretty clear to

00:00:47.370 --> 00:00:49.430 
acrylic stamp and it's pretty clear to
see<00:00:47.790> it<00:00:47.940> since<00:00:48.300> the<00:00:48.480> stamp<00:00:48.720> is<00:00:48.870> clear<00:00:49.170> and<00:00:49.290> the

00:00:49.430 --> 00:00:49.440 
see it since the stamp is clear and the

00:00:49.440 --> 00:00:51.410 
see it since the stamp is clear and the
color<00:00:49.650> is<00:00:49.830> showing<00:00:50.160> up<00:00:50.310> gives<00:00:51.030> us<00:00:51.180> a<00:00:51.270> good

00:00:51.410 --> 00:00:51.420 
color is showing up gives us a good

00:00:51.420 --> 00:00:53.870 
color is showing up gives us a good
gauge<00:00:51.660> of<00:00:51.840> how<00:00:51.900> much<00:00:52.230> ink<00:00:53.010> we<00:00:53.310> still<00:00:53.580> need<00:00:53.730> to

00:00:53.870 --> 00:00:53.880 
gauge of how much ink we still need to

00:00:53.880 --> 00:00:56.260 
gauge of how much ink we still need to
apply<00:00:54.210> or<00:00:54.480> whether<00:00:54.810> we've<00:00:55.020> covered<00:00:55.290> the<00:00:55.560> image

00:00:56.260 --> 00:00:56.270 
apply or whether we've covered the image

00:00:56.270 --> 00:00:59.030 
apply or whether we've covered the image
so<00:00:57.270> this<00:00:57.420> is<00:00:57.540> India<00:00:57.870> ink<00:00:58.079> and<00:00:58.320> it<00:00:58.440> can<00:00:58.770> stamp

00:00:59.030 --> 00:00:59.040 
so this is India ink and it can stamp

00:00:59.040 --> 00:01:02.000 
so this is India ink and it can stamp
and<00:00:59.280> once<00:00:59.400> it<00:00:59.550> dries<00:00:59.820> it's<00:01:00.120> permanent<00:01:00.630> and<00:01:01.260> you

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:02.010 
and once it dries it's permanent and you

00:01:02.010 --> 00:01:04.460 
and once it dries it's permanent and you
can<00:01:02.130> use<00:01:02.250> water<00:01:02.520> over<00:01:02.880> top<00:01:03.320> here<00:01:04.320> i'm<00:01:04.439> just

00:01:23.690 --> 00:01:23.700 
rich line just around the image and then

00:01:23.700 --> 00:01:26.960 
rich line just around the image and then
i'll<00:01:24.000> use<00:01:24.030> that<00:01:24.659> color<00:01:25.200> there<00:01:25.560> to<00:01:25.970> saturate

00:01:26.960 --> 00:01:26.970 
i'll use that color there to saturate

00:01:26.970 --> 00:01:28.550 
i'll use that color there to saturate
with<00:01:27.000> water<00:01:27.299> and<00:01:27.540> then<00:01:27.659> pull<00:01:28.080> that<00:01:28.320> colour

00:01:28.550 --> 00:01:28.560

with water and then pull that colour
into<00:01:28.950> the<00:01:28.979> image<00:01:29.070> and<00:01:29.549> this<00:01:30.330> also<00:01:30.510> allows<00:01:31.460> the

00:01:32.450 --> 00:01:32.460 
into the image and this also allows the

00:01:32.460 --> 00:01:34.399 
into the image and this also allows the
image<00:01:32.729> not<00:01:32.940> to<00:01:33.060> be<00:01:33.150> saturated<00:01:33.810> with<00:01:33.900> color<00:01:33.960> so

00:01:34.399 --> 00:01:34.409 
image not to be saturated with color so

00:01:34.409 --> 00:01:36.620 
image not to be saturated with color so

grid lines and those details will stay

00:02:15.239 --> 00:02:17.000 
grid lines and those details will stay
and<00:02:15.510> this<00:02:16.049> will<00:02:16.230> just<00:02:16.439> give<00:02:16.590> me<00:02:16.709> a<00:02:16.739> nice

00:03:05.380 --> 00:03:05.390 
then I'm going to go around the edges of

00:03:05.390 --> 00:03:08.170 
then I'm going to go around the edges of
the<00:03:05.480> Acorn<00:03:06.140> and<00:03:06.380> this<00:03:06.980> will<00:03:07.250> just<00:03:07.760> create<00:03:08.030> a

00:03:08.170 --> 00:03:08.180 
the Acorn and this will just create a

00:03:08.180 --> 00:03:11.590 
the Acorn and this will just create a
really<00:03:08.720> soft<00:03:09.140> and<00:03:10.120> backdrop<00:03:11.120> or<00:03:11.360> like<00:03:11.570> a

00:03:11.590 --> 00:03:11.600 
really soft and backdrop or like a

00:03:11.600 --> 00:03:15.490 
really soft and backdrop or like a
shadow<00:03:12.110> or<00:03:12.700> frame<00:03:13.700> if<00:03:13.940> you<00:03:14.090> will<00:03:14.270> just<00:03:15.020> really

00:03:15.490 --> 00:03:15.500 
shadow or frame if you will just really

00:03:15.500 --> 00:03:17.740 
shadow or frame if you will just really
making<00:03:15.830> the<00:03:15.950> image<00:03:16.280> pop<00:03:16.580> a<00:03:16.610> little<00:03:16.850> more<00:03:17.150> with

00:03:17.740 --> 00:03:17.750 
making the image pop a little more with

00:03:17.750 --> 00:03:21.520 
making the image pop a little more with
it<00:03:17.780> with<00:03:18.200> a<00:03:18.230> coordinating<00:03:18.860> color<00:03:20.470> okay<00:03:21.470> so

00:03:21.520 --> 00:03:21.530 
it with a coordinating color okay so

00:03:21.530 --> 00:03:23.440 
it with a coordinating color okay so
you'll<00:03:21.710> need<00:03:21.860> your<00:03:22.010> paintbrush<00:03:22.940> again<00:03:23.240> for

00:03:23.440 --> 00:03:23.450 
you'll need your paintbrush again for

00:03:23.450 --> 00:03:26.350 
you'll need your paintbrush again for
this<00:03:23.600> and<00:03:23.980> just<00:03:24.980> lightly<00:03:25.280> go<00:03:25.580> over<00:03:25.610> and<00:03:26.150> you'll

00:03:26.350 --> 00:03:26.360 
this and just lightly go over and you'll

00:03:26.360 --> 00:03:28.660 
this and just lightly go over and you'll
see<00:03:26.570> it<00:03:26.690> to<00:03:26.870> that<00:03:27.050> you<00:03:27.110> can<00:03:27.260> still<00:03:27.470> see<00:03:27.680> the<00:03:27.710> the

00:03:28.660 --> 00:03:28.670 
see it to that you can still see the the

00:03:28.670 --> 00:03:30.580 
see it to that you can still see the the
lines<00:03:28.910> underneath<00:03:29.300> so<00:03:29.630> the<00:03:29.660> gelato<00:03:30.050> is<00:03:30.230> is<00:03:30.410> not

00:03:30.580 --> 00:03:30.590 
lines underneath so the gelato is is not

00:03:30.590 --> 00:03:33.790 
lines underneath so the gelato is is not
quite<00:03:30.920> opaque<00:03:31.370> and<00:03:32.230> once<00:03:33.230> you<00:03:33.350> add<00:03:33.470> the<00:03:33.650> water

00:03:33.790 --> 00:03:33.800 
quite opaque and once you add the water

00:03:33.800 --> 00:03:36.450 
quite opaque and once you add the water
you<00:03:34.100> can<00:03:34.250> really<00:03:34.490> still<00:03:34.820> see<00:03:35.060> through<00:03:35.420> and

00:03:36.450 --> 00:03:36.460 
you can really still see through and

doing here I'm just dabbing it just to
get<00:04:04.520> kind<00:04:05.240> of<00:04:05.270> like<00:04:05.390> a<00:04:05.420> a<00:04:05.750> neat<00:04:06.670> spongy<00:04:07.670> effect
