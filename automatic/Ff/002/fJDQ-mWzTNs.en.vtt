these<00:03:43.790> bumpers<00:03:44.360> and<00:03:44.600> install<00:03:45.110> the<00:03:45.260> bars<00:03:45.500> and

00:03:45.789 --> 00:03:45.799 
these bumpers and install the bars and

00:03:45.799 --> 00:03:48.280 
these bumpers and install the bars and
tighten<00:03:46.070> them<00:03:46.160> down<00:03:46.400> to<00:03:47.299> cut<00:03:47.480> a<00:03:47.510> dual<00:03:47.810> mortise

00:03:48.280 --> 00:03:48.290 
tighten them down to cut a dual mortise

00:03:48.290 --> 00:03:50.199 
tighten them down to cut a dual mortise
and<00:03:48.440> tenon<00:03:48.890> all<00:03:49.310> we<00:03:49.519> do<00:03:49.670> is<00:03:49.790> mark<00:03:50.060> the

00:03:50.199 --> 00:03:50.209 
and tenon all we do is mark the

00:03:50.209 --> 00:03:53.320 
and tenon all we do is mark the
positions<00:03:50.720> at<00:03:50.900> a<00:03:50.959> Tenon's<00:03:51.380> on<00:03:51.590> the<00:03:51.920> stock<00:03:52.330> then

00:03:53.320 --> 00:03:53.330 
positions at a Tenon's on the stock then

00:03:53.330 --> 00:03:58.780 
positions at a Tenon's on the stock then
we<00:03:53.480> snap<00:03:53.720> the<00:03:53.959> siding<00:03:54.410> reticule<00:03:54.830> into<00:03:55.280> place

00:03:58.780 --> 00:03:58.790 

00:03:58.790 --> 00:04:01.479 

then<00:03:59.689> I<00:03:59.840> position<00:04:00.319> the<00:04:00.409> table<00:04:00.799> so<00:04:01.010> to<00:04:01.040> citing

00:04:01.479 --> 00:04:01.489 
then I position the table so to citing

00:04:01.489 --> 00:04:03.610 
then I position the table so to citing
ridicule<00:04:01.909> is<00:04:02.209> over<00:04:02.510> the<00:04:02.629> left-side<00:04:03.140> tenon

00:04:03.610 --> 00:04:03.620

a reticule over each of the Tenon's then

00:04:23.750 --> 00:04:25.779 
a reticule over each of the Tenon's then
we<00:04:23.960> just<00:04:24.169> position<00:04:24.650> a<00:04:24.740> cursor<00:04:25.220> over<00:04:25.340> the<00:04:25.580> 10

00:04:25.779 --> 00:04:25.789 
we just position a cursor over the 10

00:04:25.789 --> 00:04:27.850 
we just position a cursor over the 10

material that's left in between them now

00:05:02.060 --> 00:05:03.939 
material that's left in between them now
I<00:05:02.090> can<00:05:02.389> move<00:05:02.509> the<00:05:02.720> table<00:05:03.110> to<00:05:03.289> the<00:05:03.409> other<00:05:03.440> stop

00:05:03.939 --> 00:05:03.949 
I can move the table to the other stop

00:05:03.949 --> 00:05:06.189 
I can move the table to the other stop
to<00:05:04.370> cut<00:05:04.550> the<00:05:04.669> other<00:05:04.699> tenant<00:05:05.270> lock<00:05:05.630> it<00:05:05.840> in<00:05:05.960> place

00:05:06.189 --> 00:05:06.199 
to cut the other tenant lock it in place

00:05:06.199 --> 00:05:08.649 
to cut the other tenant lock it in place
now<00:05:06.500> we<00:05:07.159> can<00:05:07.280> make<00:05:07.550> the<00:05:07.669> climb<00:05:07.940> cut<00:05:08.240> around<00:05:08.360> the

00:05:08.649 --> 00:05:08.659 
now we can make the climb cut around the

00:05:08.659 --> 00:05:10.689 
now we can make the climb cut around the
rest<00:05:08.870> of<00:05:09.020> the<00:05:09.080> joint<00:05:09.380> and<00:05:10.099> then<00:05:10.280> we<00:05:10.430> can<00:05:10.580> go

00:05:10.689 --> 00:05:10.699 
rest of the joint and then we can go

00:05:10.699 --> 00:05:12.129 
rest of the joint and then we can go
ahead<00:05:10.820> and<00:05:11.030> route<00:05:11.240> away<00:05:11.389> the<00:05:11.690> rest<00:05:11.930> of<00:05:12.080> the

00:05:12.139 --> 00:05:14.260 
ahead and route away the rest of the
material<00:05:12.650> until<00:05:12.889> we<00:05:13.010> get<00:05:13.159> down<00:05:13.220> to<00:05:13.669> follow<00:05:13.970> the

material until we get down to follow the
template<00:05:14.690> and<00:05:15.500> now<00:05:15.680> we<00:05:15.740> have<00:05:16.070> two<00:05:16.310> perfectly

00:05:16.750 --> 00:05:16.760

formed Tenon's and we're ready to cut

00:05:18.470 --> 00:05:21.430 
formed Tenon's and we're ready to cut

00:05:21.440 --> 00:05:23.469 
the mortises the first step when cutting
mortises<00:05:22.070> is<00:05:22.340> to<00:05:22.430> make<00:05:22.580> a<00:05:22.610> series<00:05:23.030> of<00:05:23.060> plunge

00:05:23.469 --> 00:05:23.479 
mortises is to make a series of plunge

00:05:23.479 --> 00:05:26.020 
mortises is to make a series of plunge
cuts<00:05:23.840> to<00:05:24.080> remove<00:05:24.409> loss<00:05:24.650> in<00:05:24.860> the<00:05:24.919> material<00:05:25.400> then

00:05:26.020 --> 00:05:26.030 
cuts to remove loss in the material then

00:05:26.030 --> 00:05:27.640 
cuts to remove loss in the material then
we'll<00:05:26.150> go<00:05:26.270> back<00:05:26.300> and<00:05:26.539> run<00:05:26.900> the<00:05:27.020> router<00:05:27.229> through

00:05:27.640 --> 00:05:27.650 
we'll go back and run the router through

00:05:27.650 --> 00:05:29.350 
we'll go back and run the router through
the<00:05:27.830> mortise<00:05:28.220> to<00:05:28.400> make<00:05:28.550> sure<00:05:28.729> two<00:05:28.880> sides<00:05:29.150> are

00:05:29.350 --> 00:05:29.360 
the mortise to make sure two sides are

00:05:29.360 --> 00:05:32.320 
the mortise to make sure two sides are
absolutely<00:05:29.870> clean<00:05:30.520> once<00:05:31.520> again<00:05:31.760> we<00:05:31.940> move<00:05:32.150> the

00:05:32.320 --> 00:05:32.330 
absolutely clean once again we move the

00:05:32.330 --> 00:05:34.420 
absolutely clean once again we move the
table<00:05:32.720> to<00:05:32.930> cut<00:05:33.139> the<00:05:33.260> other<00:05:33.289> mortise<00:05:33.949> and<00:05:34.159> then

00:05:34.420 --> 00:05:34.430 
table to cut the other mortise and then

00:05:34.430 --> 00:05:37.270 
table to cut the other mortise and then
lock<00:05:34.639> it<00:05:34.849> in<00:05:34.940> place<00:05:35.409> and<00:05:36.409> then<00:05:36.590> we<00:05:36.740> repeat<00:05:37.159> the

00:05:37.270 --> 00:05:37.280 
lock it in place and then we repeat the

00:05:37.280 --> 00:05:39.279 
lock it in place and then we repeat the
procedure<00:05:37.430> of<00:05:38.060> making<00:05:38.270> a<00:05:38.539> series<00:05:38.900> of<00:05:38.930> plunge

00:05:39.279 --> 00:05:39.289 
procedure of making a series of plunge

00:05:39.289 --> 00:05:40.899 
procedure of making a series of plunge
cuts<00:05:39.560> and<00:05:39.830> then<00:05:39.979> going<00:05:40.220> back<00:05:40.280> and<00:05:40.699> cleaning

00:05:40.899 --> 00:05:40.909 
cuts and then going back and cleaning

00:05:40.909 --> 00:05:43.270 
cuts and then going back and cleaning
out<00:05:41.150> the<00:05:41.330> mortgage<00:05:41.659> this<00:05:42.530> is<00:05:42.770> actually<00:05:43.130> the

00:05:43.270 --> 00:05:43.280 
out the mortgage this is actually the

00:05:43.280 --> 00:05:45.189 
out the mortgage this is actually the
second<00:05:43.729> joint<00:05:43.970> I<00:05:44.120> made<00:05:44.330> the<00:05:44.630> first<00:05:44.870> one<00:05:45.050> was

00:05:45.189 --> 00:05:45.199 
second joint I made the first one was

00:05:45.199 --> 00:05:47.230 
second joint I made the first one was
too<00:05:45.409> tight<00:05:45.740> after<00:05:46.310> a<00:05:46.370> little<00:05:46.490> adjustment<00:05:47.030> with

00:05:47.230 --> 00:05:47.240 
too tight after a little adjustment with

00:05:47.240 --> 00:05:49.870 
too tight after a little adjustment with
the<00:05:47.270> pins<00:05:47.630> get<00:05:48.199> a<00:05:48.229> snap<00:05:48.620> together<00:05:48.919> fit<00:05:49.310> flush

00:05:49.870 --> 00:05:49.880 
the pins get a snap together fit flush

00:05:49.880 --> 00:05:53.770 
the pins get a snap together fit flush
faces<00:05:50.479> and<00:05:50.690> a<00:05:51.050> perfect<00:05:51.500> joint
