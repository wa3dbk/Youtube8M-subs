00:01:35.539 --> 00:01:37.660 
actually reducing my frame rate why it's
cutting<00:01:36.050> it<00:01:36.170> in<00:01:36.289> half<00:01:36.320> I<00:01:36.830> was<00:01:37.070> lucky<00:01:37.340> to<00:01:37.490> be

00:01:37.660 --> 00:01:37.670 
cutting it in half I was lucky to be

00:01:37.670 --> 00:01:47.140 
cutting it in half I was lucky to be
getting<00:01:37.880> more<00:01:38.240> than<00:01:38.330> 13<00:01:38.840> frames<00:01:39.170> a<00:01:39.380> second

00:01:47.140 --> 00:01:47.150 

00:01:47.150 --> 00:01:49.990 

no<00:01:47.720> matter<00:01:47.930> how<00:01:48.290> fast<00:01:48.680> I<00:01:48.980> boost<00:01:49.370> they<00:01:49.700> just

00:01:49.990 --> 00:01:50.000 
no matter how fast I boost they just

00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:51.880 
no matter how fast I boost they just
work<00:01:50.330> oh<00:01:50.630> hey

00:01:51.880 --> 00:01:51.890 
work oh hey

00:01:51.890 --> 00:01:54.550 
work oh hey
I<00:01:51.920> believe<00:01:52.670> it's<00:01:52.850> only<00:01:53.000> green<00:01:53.480> hill<00:01:53.810> zone<00:01:53.840> act

00:01:54.550 --> 00:01:54.560 
I believe it's only green hill zone act

00:01:54.560 --> 00:01:57.640 
I believe it's only green hill zone act
2<00:01:54.950> which<00:01:55.400> is<00:01:55.580> actually<00:01:56.060> changed<00:01:56.720> because<00:01:57.500> I

00:01:57.640 --> 00:01:57.650 
2 which is actually changed because I

00:01:57.650 --> 00:01:59.620 
2 which is actually changed because I
can't<00:01:58.160> see<00:01:58.520> the<00:01:58.670> guy<00:01:58.820> wanting<00:01:59.210> to<00:01:59.330> do<00:01:59.480> the

00:01:59.620 --> 00:01:59.630 
can't see the guy wanting to do the

00:01:59.630 --> 00:02:01.930 
can't see the guy wanting to do the
other<00:01:59.780> stages<00:02:00.170> and<00:02:00.500> wonder<00:02:00.680> why<00:02:00.860> so<00:02:01.520> I<00:02:01.550> suppose

00:02:01.930 --> 00:02:01.940 
other stages and wonder why so I suppose

00:02:01.940 --> 00:02:05.130 
other stages and wonder why so I suppose
the<00:02:02.150> title<00:02:02.480> might<00:02:02.660> be<00:02:02.810> a<00:02:02.840> bit<00:02:03.140> misleading

00:02:05.130 --> 00:02:05.140 
the title might be a bit misleading

00:02:05.140 --> 00:02:07.780 
the title might be a bit misleading
considering<00:02:06.140> it<00:02:06.230> is<00:02:06.350> only<00:02:06.530> the<00:02:06.740> one<00:02:06.890> stage<00:02:07.250> but

00:02:07.780 --> 00:02:07.790 
considering it is only the one stage but

00:02:07.790 --> 00:02:15.210 
considering it is only the one stage but
yeah<00:02:08.210> I<00:02:08.240> think<00:02:08.420> it's<00:02:08.810> appropriate

00:02:15.210 --> 00:02:15.220 

00:02:15.220 --> 00:02:20.470 

I<00:02:18.040> have<00:02:19.040> actually<00:02:19.220> checked<00:02:19.790> as<00:02:19.970> well<00:02:20.180> to<00:02:20.330> make

00:02:20.470 --> 00:02:20.480 
I have actually checked as well to make

00:02:20.480 --> 00:02:22.330 
I have actually checked as well to make
sure<00:02:20.750> that<00:02:20.930> it's<00:02:21.080> not<00:02:21.290> just<00:02:21.319> my<00:02:21.830> PC<00:02:22.280> in

00:02:22.330 --> 00:02:22.340 
sure that it's not just my PC in

00:02:22.340 --> 00:02:23.890 
sure that it's not just my PC in
recording<00:02:22.880> software<00:02:23.270> disagreeing<00:02:23.840> with

00:02:23.890 --> 00:02:23.900
