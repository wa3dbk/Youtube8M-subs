character<00:03:34.459> to<00:03:34.640> me<00:03:34.790> we<00:03:35.390> met<00:03:35.630> her<00:03:35.989> in<00:03:36.319> Disney's

00:03:36.850 --> 00:03:36.860 
character to me we met her in Disney's

00:03:36.860 --> 00:03:39.130 
character to me we met her in Disney's
Animal<00:03:37.250> Kingdom<00:03:37.310> near<00:03:37.970> that<00:03:38.390> it's<00:03:38.630> a<00:03:38.720> bug<00:03:38.900> life

Animal Kingdom near that it's a bug life
entrance<00:03:39.709> I<00:03:39.980> think<00:03:40.520> she<00:03:40.670> changes<00:03:40.810> locations

00:03:41.800 --> 00:03:41.810 
entrance I think she changes locations

00:03:41.810 --> 00:03:44.770 
entrance I think she changes locations
so<00:03:42.670> you'll<00:03:43.670> probably<00:03:43.910> have<00:03:44.150> to<00:03:44.270> ask<00:03:44.420> where

00:03:44.770 --> 00:03:44.780 
so you'll probably have to ask where

00:03:44.780 --> 00:03:46.600 
so you'll probably have to ask where
she's<00:03:45.050> at<00:03:45.230> if<00:03:45.500> that<00:03:45.709> place<00:03:46.010> where<00:03:46.280> I<00:03:46.310> met<00:03:46.520> her

she's at if that place where I met her

00:03:46.610 --> 00:03:48.759 
she's at if that place where I met her
is<00:03:46.819> permanent<00:03:47.360> or<00:03:47.480> not<00:03:47.660> I<00:03:47.930> think<00:03:48.200> this<00:03:48.560> meeting

00:03:48.759 --> 00:03:48.769 
is permanent or not I think this meeting

00:03:48.769 --> 00:04:04.410 
is permanent or not I think this meeting
