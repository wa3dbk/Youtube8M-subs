I do not know how to defeat the game
without<00:01:15.469> arrows<00:01:15.860> but<00:01:16.640> perhaps<00:01:16.880> there<00:01:17.119> is

00:01:17.260 --> 00:01:17.270 
without arrows but perhaps there is

00:01:17.270 --> 00:01:18.639 
without arrows but perhaps there is
using<00:01:17.570> the<00:01:17.630> infinite<00:01:17.899> sword<00:01:18.259> glitch<00:01:18.530> or

00:01:18.639 --> 00:01:18.649 
using the infinite sword glitch or

00:01:18.649 --> 00:01:20.529 
using the infinite sword glitch or
something<00:01:18.710> like<00:01:19.070> so<00:01:19.909> as<00:01:20.210> you<00:01:20.299> can<00:01:20.390> see<00:01:20.450> I

I haven't defeated all the pose yet

00:01:26.869 --> 00:01:28.029 
I haven't defeated all the pose yet
