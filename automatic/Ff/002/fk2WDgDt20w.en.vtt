00:01:10.330 --> 00:01:12.970 

now<00:01:11.330> here's<00:01:11.540> a<00:01:11.600> good<00:01:11.690> example<00:01:11.780> of<00:01:12.320> the

00:01:12.970 --> 00:01:12.980 
now here's a good example of the

00:01:12.980 --> 00:01:15.040 
now here's a good example of the
repetitiveness<00:01:13.550> I<00:01:13.910> had<00:01:14.150> to<00:01:14.270> fight<00:01:14.420> for<00:01:14.780> waves

00:01:15.040 --> 00:01:15.050 
repetitiveness I had to fight for waves

00:01:15.050 --> 00:01:16.690 
repetitiveness I had to fight for waves
of<00:01:15.470> Doom's<00:01:15.650> minions<00:01:16.070> before<00:01:16.220> I<00:01:16.460> could

00:01:16.690 --> 00:01:16.700 
of Doom's minions before I could

00:01:16.700 --> 00:01:18.550 
of Doom's minions before I could
actually<00:01:16.820> take<00:01:17.150> him<00:01:17.330> out<00:01:17.420> for<00:01:17.600> good<00:01:17.780> and<00:01:18.050> that

00:01:18.550 --> 00:01:18.560 
actually take him out for good and that

00:01:18.560 --> 00:01:21.610 
actually take him out for good and that
was<00:01:18.770> very<00:01:18.800> annoying<00:01:19.900> here<00:01:20.900> we<00:01:20.990> have<00:01:21.140> one<00:01:21.530> of

00:01:21.610 --> 00:01:21.620 
was very annoying here we have one of

00:01:21.620 --> 00:01:22.900 
was very annoying here we have one of
the<00:01:21.740> more<00:01:22.100> interesting<00:01:22.280> levels<00:01:22.700> in<00:01:22.820> my

00:01:22.900 --> 00:01:22.910 
the more interesting levels in my

00:01:22.910 --> 00:01:25.540 
the more interesting levels in my
opinion<00:01:23.330> where<00:01:23.780> you<00:01:23.870> play<00:01:24.080> as<00:01:24.320> Hawkeye<00:01:25.160> Black

00:01:25.540 --> 00:01:25.550 
opinion where you play as Hawkeye Black

00:01:25.550 --> 00:01:27.340 
opinion where you play as Hawkeye Black
Widow<00:01:25.820> and<00:01:26.120> spider-man<00:01:26.600> the<00:01:26.720> Black<00:01:26.900> Widow<00:01:27.080> is

00:01:27.340 --> 00:01:27.350 
Widow and spider-man the Black Widow is

00:01:27.350 --> 00:01:30.250 
Widow and spider-man the Black Widow is
a<00:01:27.770> very<00:01:28.310> cool<00:01:28.520> character<00:01:28.760> to<00:01:28.910> play<00:01:29.030> as<00:01:29.140> she<00:01:30.140> can

00:01:30.250 --> 00:01:30.260 
a very cool character to play as she can

00:01:30.260 --> 00:01:31.900 
a very cool character to play as she can
pretty<00:01:30.440> much<00:01:30.500> turn<00:01:30.830> invisible<00:01:31.220> and<00:01:31.550> get<00:01:31.700> past

00:01:31.900 --> 00:01:31.910 
pretty much turn invisible and get past

00:01:31.910 --> 00:01:34.420 
pretty much turn invisible and get past
any<00:01:32.270> sensors<00:01:32.840> that<00:01:33.020> are<00:01:33.080> around<00:01:33.350> her<00:01:33.680> and<00:01:33.920> that

00:01:34.420 --> 00:01:34.430 
any sensors that are around her and that

00:01:34.430 --> 00:01:37.990 
any sensors that are around her and that
becomes<00:01:35.210> very<00:01:35.930> useful<00:01:36.740> in<00:01:37.370> the<00:01:37.550> open<00:01:37.820> world

00:01:37.990 --> 00:01:38.000 
becomes very useful in the open world

00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:39.400 
becomes very useful in the open world
where<00:01:38.330> you<00:01:38.420> have<00:01:38.570> able<00:01:38.750> to<00:01:38.870> unlock<00:01:39.110> many

00:01:39.400 --> 00:01:39.410

00:01:39.410 --> 00:01:49.330 
where you have able to unlock many
things<00:01:39.710> by<00:01:40.070> using<00:01:40.220> that<00:01:40.460> ability<00:01:48.100> and<00:01:49.100> then<00:01:49.250> we

00:01:49.330 --> 00:01:49.340 
things by using that ability and then we

00:01:49.340 --> 00:01:53.290 
things by using that ability and then we
have<00:01:49.490> a<00:01:49.520> big<00:01:49.850> fig<00:01:51.550> thing<00:01:52.550> that<00:01:52.700> you<00:01:52.759> can<00:01:52.910> do<00:01:53.030> you
