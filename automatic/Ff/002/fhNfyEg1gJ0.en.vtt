you
first<00:00:14.350> I<00:00:14.590> start<00:00:14.920> making<00:00:15.100> the<00:00:15.610> mood<00:00:15.880> board<00:00:16.210> so

00:00:17.100 --> 00:00:17.110 
first I start making the mood board so

00:00:17.110 --> 00:00:18.840 
first I start making the mood board so
I'll<00:00:17.200> take<00:00:17.470> that<00:00:17.530> lots<00:00:17.950> of<00:00:18.040> pictures<00:00:18.280> the<00:00:18.610> kind

00:00:18.840 --> 00:00:18.850 
I'll take that lots of pictures the kind

00:00:18.850 --> 00:00:20.100 
I'll take that lots of pictures the kind
of<00:00:18.910> things<00:00:19.150> that<00:00:19.300> I'm<00:00:19.420> interested<00:00:19.570> in<00:00:20.020> is

00:00:20.100 --> 00:00:20.110 
of things that I'm interested in is

00:00:20.110 --> 00:00:21.540 
of things that I'm interested in is
print<00:00:20.380> them<00:00:20.530> all<00:00:20.650> out<00:00:20.830> and<00:00:20.980> then<00:00:21.070> get<00:00:21.280> them<00:00:21.430> up

00:00:21.540 --> 00:00:21.550 
print them all out and then get them up

00:00:21.550 --> 00:00:23.550 
print them all out and then get them up
here<00:00:21.580> then<00:00:22.390> the<00:00:22.510> project<00:00:22.900> kind<00:00:23.050> of<00:00:23.170> slowly

00:00:23.550 --> 00:00:23.560 
here then the project kind of slowly

00:00:23.560 --> 00:00:26.519 
here then the project kind of slowly
starts<00:00:24.070> taking<00:00:24.520> some<00:00:24.790> kind<00:00:25.060> of<00:00:25.180> form<00:00:25.540> and<00:00:26.260> then

00:00:26.519 --> 00:00:26.529 
starts taking some kind of form and then

00:00:26.529 --> 00:00:28.890 
starts taking some kind of form and then
I'll<00:00:26.650> start<00:00:26.920> making<00:00:27.100> something<00:00:27.580> and<00:00:27.900> printing

00:00:28.890 --> 00:00:28.900 
I'll start making something and printing

00:00:28.900 --> 00:00:30.390 
I'll start making something and printing
the<00:00:28.960> pictures<00:00:29.290> out<00:00:29.410> I'm<00:00:29.560> putting<00:00:29.830> up<00:00:29.950> here<00:00:30.220> so

00:00:30.390 --> 00:00:30.400 
the pictures out I'm putting up here so

00:00:30.400 --> 00:00:33.240 
the pictures out I'm putting up here so
I<00:00:30.460> can<00:00:30.490> reflect<00:00:31.030> on<00:00:31.210> them<00:00:31.360> this<00:00:32.320> one<00:00:32.620> is<00:00:32.800> at<00:00:33.190> the

00:00:33.240 --> 00:00:33.250 
I can reflect on them this one is at the

00:00:33.250 --> 00:00:35.640 
I can reflect on them this one is at the
stage<00:00:33.670> where<00:00:34.030> the<00:00:34.540> actual<00:00:34.809> project<00:00:35.290> which<00:00:35.470> was

00:00:35.640 --> 00:00:35.650 
stage where the actual project which was

00:00:35.650 --> 00:00:37.740 
stage where the actual project which was
the<00:00:35.800> film<00:00:36.129> has<00:00:36.550> been<00:00:36.790> done<00:00:37.090> but<00:00:37.390> I've<00:00:37.510> started

00:00:37.740 --> 00:00:37.750 
the film has been done but I've started

00:00:37.750 --> 00:00:40.770 
the film has been done but I've started
to<00:00:38.020> make<00:00:38.170> these<00:00:38.379> 3d<00:00:38.920> lenticular<00:00:39.160> images<00:00:40.000> so

00:00:40.770 --> 00:00:40.780 
to make these 3d lenticular images so

00:00:40.780 --> 00:00:42.900 
to make these 3d lenticular images so
it's<00:00:40.930> trying<00:00:41.110> to<00:00:41.199> tease<00:00:41.680> out<00:00:41.980> some<00:00:42.010> other<00:00:42.610> kind

00:00:42.900 --> 00:00:42.910 
it's trying to tease out some other kind

00:00:42.910 --> 00:00:46.079 
it's trying to tease out some other kind
of<00:00:43.090> form<00:00:43.449> that<00:00:44.320> these<00:00:44.580> flowers<00:00:45.580> could<00:00:45.790> take

00:00:46.079 --> 00:00:46.089 
of form that these flowers could take

00:00:46.089 --> 00:00:50.009 
of form that these flowers could take
and<00:00:46.720> I'm<00:00:46.989> also<00:00:47.140> making<00:00:47.290> some<00:00:48.239> wax<00:00:49.239> version<00:00:49.870> of

00:00:50.009 --> 00:00:50.019 
and I'm also making some wax version of

00:00:50.019 --> 00:00:53.930 
and I'm also making some wax version of
the<00:00:50.110> same<00:00:50.400> flowers<00:00:51.870> so<00:00:52.870> first<00:00:53.080> I<00:00:53.260> get<00:00:53.500> some

00:00:53.930 --> 00:00:53.940 
the same flowers so first I get some

00:00:53.940 --> 00:00:56.520 
the same flowers so first I get some
modeling<00:00:54.940> mesh<00:00:55.120> like<00:00:55.360> this<00:00:55.540> and<00:00:55.780> make<00:00:56.170> it<00:00:56.290> into

00:00:56.520 --> 00:00:56.530 
modeling mesh like this and make it into

00:00:56.530 --> 00:00:58.590 
modeling mesh like this and make it into
a<00:00:56.559> shape<00:00:57.010> and<00:00:57.309> then<00:00:57.460> we<00:00:57.580> drip<00:00:57.909> and<00:00:58.089> pour<00:00:58.390> wax

00:00:58.590 --> 00:00:58.600 
a shape and then we drip and pour wax

00:00:58.600 --> 00:01:00.570 
a shape and then we drip and pour wax
onto<00:00:58.960> it<00:00:59.199> to<00:00:59.350> give<00:00:59.530> it<00:00:59.680> more<00:01:00.010> of<00:01:00.070> a<00:01:00.220> rigidity

00:01:00.570 --> 00:01:00.580 
onto it to give it more of a rigidity

00:01:00.580 --> 00:01:03.299 
onto it to give it more of a rigidity
and<00:01:01.120> then<00:01:01.540> start<00:01:01.839> adding<00:01:02.019> bits<00:01:02.379> of<00:01:02.559> color<00:01:02.830> so

00:01:03.299 --> 00:01:03.309 
and then start adding bits of color so

00:01:03.309 --> 00:01:04.950 
and then start adding bits of color so
that<00:01:03.339> the<00:01:03.729> flower<00:01:04.150> looks<00:01:04.390> like<00:01:04.629> it's<00:01:04.809> actually

00:01:04.950 --> 00:01:04.960 
that the flower looks like it's actually

00:01:04.960 --> 00:01:07.310 
that the flower looks like it's actually
contracted<00:01:05.830> a<00:01:05.860> disease<00:01:06.280> of<00:01:06.760> some<00:01:07.000> kind

00:01:07.310 --> 00:01:07.320 
contracted a disease of some kind

00:01:07.320 --> 00:01:09.600 
contracted a disease of some kind
preferably<00:01:08.320> a<00:01:08.350> sexual<00:01:08.890> disease<00:01:09.070> such<00:01:09.460> as

00:01:09.600 --> 00:01:09.610 
preferably a sexual disease such as

00:01:09.610 --> 00:01:11.300 
preferably a sexual disease such as
syphilis<00:01:09.850> which<00:01:10.330> gives<00:01:10.630> her<00:01:10.780> a<00:01:10.810> kind<00:01:11.140> of

00:01:11.300 --> 00:01:11.310 
syphilis which gives her a kind of

00:01:11.310 --> 00:01:15.620 
syphilis which gives her a kind of
repulsion<00:01:12.750> to<00:01:13.750> contrast<00:01:14.229> with<00:01:14.470> sexual<00:01:15.040> allure

00:01:15.620 --> 00:01:15.630 
repulsion to contrast with sexual allure

00:01:15.630 --> 00:01:19.469 
repulsion to contrast with sexual allure
we've<00:01:16.630> got<00:01:17.380> little<00:01:17.530> wires<00:01:17.890> inside<00:01:18.430> here<00:01:18.969> which

00:01:19.469 --> 00:01:19.479 
we've got little wires inside here which

00:01:19.479 --> 00:01:22.020 
we've got little wires inside here which
simulate<00:01:20.350> certain<00:01:20.860> veins<00:01:21.369> when<00:01:21.850> there's

00:01:22.020 --> 00:01:22.030 
simulate certain veins when there's

00:01:22.030 --> 00:01:23.219 
simulate certain veins when there's
light<00:01:22.240> behind<00:01:22.600> it<00:01:22.719> the<00:01:22.780> flower<00:01:22.990> becomes

00:01:23.219 --> 00:01:23.229 
light behind it the flower becomes

00:01:23.229 --> 00:01:25.920 
light behind it the flower becomes
translucent<00:01:23.789> then<00:01:24.789> these<00:01:25.060> flowers<00:01:25.420> will<00:01:25.750> go

00:01:25.920 --> 00:01:25.930 
translucent then these flowers will go

00:01:25.930 --> 00:01:28.980 
translucent then these flowers will go
on<00:01:26.110> to<00:01:26.560> these<00:01:26.740> metal<00:01:27.219> armatures<00:01:27.820> here<00:01:28.180> and<00:01:28.509> as

00:01:28.980 --> 00:01:28.990 
on to these metal armatures here and as

00:01:28.990 --> 00:01:32.069 
on to these metal armatures here and as
certain<00:01:29.460> objects<00:01:30.460> of<00:01:30.670> post-industrial<00:01:31.329> decay

00:01:32.069 --> 00:01:32.079 
certain objects of post-industrial decay

00:01:32.079 --> 00:01:33.749 
certain objects of post-industrial decay
is<00:01:32.140> going<00:01:32.439> to<00:01:32.500> be<00:01:32.590> added<00:01:32.890> at<00:01:33.009> the<00:01:33.070> bottom<00:01:33.189> which

00:01:33.749 --> 00:01:33.759 
is going to be added at the bottom which

00:01:33.759 --> 00:01:36.810 
is going to be added at the bottom which
indicate<00:01:34.299> that<00:01:34.689> these<00:01:34.960> things<00:01:35.380> could<00:01:36.369> have

00:01:36.810 --> 00:01:36.820 
indicate that these things could have

00:01:36.820 --> 00:01:40.260 
indicate that these things could have
become<00:01:37.680> certain<00:01:38.680> mutant<00:01:39.219> species<00:01:39.609> that<00:01:40.090> have

00:01:40.260 --> 00:01:40.270 
become certain mutant species that have

00:01:40.270 --> 00:01:44.910 
become certain mutant species that have
grown<00:01:40.509> out<00:01:40.869> of<00:01:40.899> this<00:01:41.320> toxic<00:01:42.100> wasteland

00:01:44.910 --> 00:01:44.920 

00:01:44.920 --> 00:01:46.920 

a<00:01:44.979> lot<00:01:45.280> of<00:01:45.430> work<00:01:45.549> I'm<00:01:45.790> taking<00:01:45.970> is<00:01:46.450> from<00:01:46.659> nature

00:01:46.920 --> 00:01:46.930 
a lot of work I'm taking is from nature

00:01:46.930 --> 00:01:48.929 
a lot of work I'm taking is from nature
even<00:01:47.680> if<00:01:47.830> I'm<00:01:47.920> working<00:01:48.250> on<00:01:48.340> things<00:01:48.670> on

00:01:48.929 --> 00:01:48.939 
even if I'm working on things on

00:01:48.939 --> 00:01:50.880 
even if I'm working on things on
computer<00:01:49.659> programs<00:01:50.140> which<00:01:50.380> is<00:01:50.500> a<00:01:50.530> lot

00:01:50.880 --> 00:01:50.890 
computer programs which is a lot

00:01:50.890 --> 00:01:53.249 
computer programs which is a lot
generally<00:01:51.759> it<00:01:52.030> all<00:01:52.180> comes<00:01:52.450> back<00:01:52.600> to<00:01:52.780> actually

00:01:53.249 --> 00:01:53.259 
generally it all comes back to actually

00:01:53.259 --> 00:01:55.620 
generally it all comes back to actually
studying<00:01:53.680> nature<00:01:53.950> so<00:01:54.880> I'll<00:01:55.000> have<00:01:55.180> things<00:01:55.450> like

00:01:55.620 --> 00:01:55.630 
studying nature so I'll have things like

00:01:55.630 --> 00:01:57.300 
studying nature so I'll have things like
this<00:01:55.780> little<00:01:55.990> bat<00:01:56.290> here<00:01:56.649> which<00:01:56.799> are<00:01:57.009> quite<00:01:57.250> a

00:01:57.300 --> 00:01:57.310 
this little bat here which are quite a

00:01:57.310 --> 00:01:59.130 
this little bat here which are quite a
freakish<00:01:58.000> look<00:01:58.240> to<00:01:58.390> it<00:01:58.509> because<00:01:58.780> I<00:01:58.810> might<00:01:59.110> be

00:01:59.130 --> 00:01:59.140 
freakish look to it because I might be

00:01:59.140 --> 00:02:01.230 
freakish look to it because I might be
taking<00:01:59.770> something<00:02:00.009> like<00:02:00.280> the<00:02:00.399> translucency

00:02:01.230 --> 00:02:01.240 
taking something like the translucency

00:02:01.240 --> 00:02:02.910 
taking something like the translucency
of<00:02:01.330> the<00:02:01.420> wing<00:02:01.630> or<00:02:01.810> the<00:02:01.960> way<00:02:02.049> that<00:02:02.229> the<00:02:02.470> feathers

00:02:02.910 --> 00:02:02.920 
of the wing or the way that the feathers

00:02:02.920 --> 00:02:06.499 
of the wing or the way that the feathers
actually<00:02:03.460> meet<00:02:03.700> the<00:02:03.909> wing<00:02:04.090> there

00:02:06.499 --> 00:02:06.509 

00:02:06.509 --> 00:02:08.449 

there's<00:02:07.170> a<00:02:07.259> project<00:02:07.680> that<00:02:07.740> I'm<00:02:07.890> developing
