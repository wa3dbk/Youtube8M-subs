of build a wood pyramid with solid
layers<00:00:26.279> of<00:00:26.580> wood<00:00:26.789> each<00:00:27.750> layer<00:00:28.050> a<00:00:28.080> little<00:00:28.560> bit

00:00:28.700 --> 00:00:28.710 
layers of wood each layer a little bit

00:00:28.710 --> 00:00:30.589 
layers of wood each layer a little bit
shorter<00:00:29.010> than<00:00:29.220> with<00:00:29.519> smaller<00:00:29.849> pieces<00:00:30.179> of<00:00:30.420> wood

00:00:30.589 --> 00:00:30.599 
shorter than with smaller pieces of wood

00:00:30.599 --> 00:00:34.040 
shorter than with smaller pieces of wood
and<00:00:30.869> the<00:00:30.960> first<00:00:31.500> layer<00:00:31.769> and<00:00:32.120> you<00:00:33.120> go<00:00:33.809> up<00:00:33.899> a

00:00:34.040 --> 00:00:34.050 
and the first layer and you go up a

00:00:34.050 --> 00:00:35.660 
and the first layer and you go up a
smaller<00:00:34.320> and<00:00:34.559> smaller<00:00:34.770> pieces<00:00:35.130> of<00:00:35.309> wood<00:00:35.460> each

smaller and smaller pieces of wood each

00:00:35.670 --> 00:00:38.720 
smaller and smaller pieces of wood each
one<00:00:36.079> late<00:00:37.079> at<00:00:37.230> 90<00:00:37.530> degrees<00:00:37.559> the<00:00:38.190> one<00:00:38.340> before<00:00:38.489> it

00:00:38.720 --> 00:00:38.730 
one late at 90 degrees the one before it

00:00:38.730 --> 00:00:41.420 
one late at 90 degrees the one before it
and<00:00:38.969> to<00:00:39.090> make<00:00:39.450> a<00:00:39.480> wood<00:00:40.020> pyramid<00:00:40.500> up<00:00:40.649> end<00:00:41.309> up

00:00:41.420 --> 00:00:41.430 
and to make a wood pyramid up end up

00:00:41.430 --> 00:00:43.549 
and to make a wood pyramid up end up
with<00:00:41.610> 46<00:00:42.180> layers<00:00:42.570> of<00:00:42.870> pencil<00:00:43.230> science

00:00:43.549 --> 00:00:43.559 
with 46 layers of pencil science

00:00:43.559 --> 00:00:45.590 
with 46 layers of pencil science
kindling<00:00:44.010> up<00:00:44.160> here<00:00:44.340> at<00:00:44.399> the<00:00:44.460> top<00:00:44.550> going<00:00:45.539> to

00:00:45.590 --> 00:00:45.600 
kindling up here at the top going to

00:00:45.600 --> 00:00:47.360 
kindling up here at the top going to
light<00:00:45.750> the<00:00:45.960> fire<00:00:46.170> at<00:00:46.350> the<00:00:46.410> top<00:00:46.710> so<00:00:47.010> you<00:00:47.070> use<00:00:47.340> a

light the fire at the top so you use a
little<00:00:48.120> bit<00:00:48.300> of<00:00:48.360> a<00:00:48.750> handful<00:00:49.410> of<00:00:49.500> cedar

00:00:49.700 --> 00:00:49.710 
little bit of a handful of cedar

00:00:49.710 --> 00:00:51.260 
little bit of a handful of cedar
shavings<00:00:50.039> or<00:00:50.430> something<00:00:50.760> something<00:00:50.940> that's<00:00:51.210> a

that going you like the fire at the top
here<00:00:59.190> now<00:00:59.910> the<00:00:59.969> benefits<00:01:00.600> to<00:01:00.840> this<00:01:00.989> firelight

00:01:01.610 --> 00:01:01.620 
here now the benefits to this firelight

00:01:01.620 --> 00:01:03.709 
here now the benefits to this firelight
it's<00:01:01.920> this<00:01:02.520> way<00:01:02.670> of<00:01:02.789> building<00:01:03.059> a<00:01:03.239> fire<00:01:03.449> is<00:01:03.570> it

00:01:03.709 --> 00:01:03.719 
it's this way of building a fire is it

00:01:03.719 --> 00:01:06.140 
it's this way of building a fire is it
you<00:01:04.140> light<00:01:04.320> the<00:01:04.470> fire<00:01:04.680> at<00:01:04.860> the<00:01:04.920> top<00:01:05.220> you<00:01:05.939> get<00:01:06.119> a

00:01:06.140 --> 00:01:06.150 
you light the fire at the top you get a

00:01:06.150 --> 00:01:07.820 
you light the fire at the top you get a
good<00:01:06.360> draft<00:01:06.659> established<00:01:07.350> and<00:01:07.530> you<00:01:07.590> through

00:01:07.820 --> 00:01:07.830 
good draft established and you through

00:01:07.830 --> 00:01:09.260 
good draft established and you through

adhere your fires at the top all those

00:01:57.750 --> 00:01:59.899 
adhere your fires at the top all those
gases<00:01:58.320> have<00:01:58.799> to<00:01:58.950> pass<00:01:59.219> through<00:01:59.490> the<00:01:59.640> flames

you're<00:02:00.149> going<00:02:00.270> to<00:02:00.329> burn<00:02:00.479> almost<00:02:00.960> all<00:02:01.259> of<00:02:01.409> those

you're going to burn almost all of those
flammable<00:02:02.579> gases<00:02:03.060> so<00:02:03.719> you<00:02:03.780> get<00:02:04.020> a<00:02:04.049> fire<00:02:04.560> that

00:02:04.600 --> 00:02:04.610 
flammable gases so you get a fire that

00:02:04.610 --> 00:02:07.910 
flammable gases so you get a fire that
burns<00:02:05.610> forty<00:02:06.390> to<00:02:06.509> sixty<00:02:06.689> percent<00:02:07.049> more<00:02:07.530> fuel

00:02:07.910 --> 00:02:07.920 
burns forty to sixty percent more fuel

00:02:07.920 --> 00:02:10.100 
burns forty to sixty percent more fuel
than<00:02:08.220> you<00:02:08.399> would<00:02:08.610> and<00:02:08.879> you<00:02:08.910> typically<00:02:09.360> do<00:02:09.539> and

how<00:03:03.670> you<00:03:03.730> built<00:03:04.060> the<00:03:04.209> fire<00:03:04.360> how<00:03:04.599> big<00:03:04.840> would<00:03:05.079> you

00:03:05.130 --> 00:03:05.140 
how you built the fire how big would you

00:03:05.140 --> 00:03:07.259 
how you built the fire how big would you
put<00:03:05.440> in<00:03:05.530> starting<00:03:05.920> out<00:03:06.069> with<00:03:06.250> that<00:03:06.910> will<00:03:07.090> burn

00:03:07.259 --> 00:03:07.269 
put in starting out with that will burn

00:03:07.269 --> 00:03:09.930 
put in starting out with that will burn
a<00:03:07.599> lot<00:03:08.200> of<00:03:08.260> wood<00:03:08.590> and<00:03:09.130> it<00:03:09.280> will<00:03:09.370> burn<00:03:09.519> all<00:03:09.700> of<00:03:09.730> it

00:03:09.930 --> 00:03:09.940 
a lot of wood and it will burn all of it

00:03:09.940 --> 00:03:12.870 
a lot of wood and it will burn all of it
all<00:03:10.060> the<00:03:10.150> way<00:03:10.239> down<00:03:10.450> to<00:03:10.480> the<00:03:10.599> bottom<00:03:11.730> it<00:03:12.730> makes

00:03:12.870 --> 00:03:12.880 
all the way down to the bottom it makes

00:03:12.880 --> 00:03:14.819 
all the way down to the bottom it makes
it<00:03:13.030> pretty<00:03:13.180> fire<00:03:13.510> you<00:03:13.750> seen<00:03:14.049> burning<00:03:14.530> all<00:03:14.709> the

00:03:14.819 --> 00:03:14.829 
it pretty fire you seen burning all the

00:03:14.829 --> 00:03:16.979 
it pretty fire you seen burning all the
smoke<00:03:15.099> up<00:03:15.310> here<00:03:15.610> so<00:03:15.819> it's<00:03:16.360> also<00:03:16.540> nearly

00:03:16.979 --> 00:03:16.989 
smoke up here so it's also nearly
