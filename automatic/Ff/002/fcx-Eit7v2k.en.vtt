00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.690
 The most fashionable diet is now Moscow and 

00:00:03.270 --> 00:00:08.330
 in general in Russia is possible and in the west it 

00:00:06.690 --> 00:00:17.910
 Ducan's diet 

00:00:08.330 --> 00:00:22.140
 Now I will not tell as all 

00:00:17.910 --> 00:00:24.560
 there are so many diets that is 

00:00:22.140 --> 00:00:28.500
 everyone comes up with their diet and 

00:00:24.560 --> 00:00:29.789
 actually the dean what did he take 

00:00:28.500 --> 00:00:33.120
 several diets 

00:00:29.789 --> 00:00:36.120
 all this is somehow synthesized under his 

00:00:33.120 --> 00:00:40.170
 vision and propiaril 

00:00:36.120 --> 00:00:43.070
 everyone watching the diet class started it 

00:00:40.170 --> 00:00:44.250
 apply he earns a ton of money a 

00:00:43.070 --> 00:00:47.539
 actually 

00:00:44.250 --> 00:00:50.250
 To understand what the system of Dukan 

00:00:47.539 --> 00:00:55.590
 I'll tell you what it is 

00:00:50.250 --> 00:00:57.600
 it turns out that of the variety get 

00:00:55.590 --> 00:00:59.730
 there are only two kinds as i have 

00:00:57.600 --> 00:01:02.820
 said this classic and 

00:00:59.730 --> 00:01:05.970
 non - classical outside classical diets 

00:01:02.820 --> 00:01:08.729
 this is a low carb titanium 

00:01:05.970 --> 00:01:11.630
 and the Kremlin so here he took a diet 

00:01:08.729 --> 00:01:15.450
 atkins that is it is the Kremlin diet 

00:01:11.630 --> 00:01:19.500
 mixed it there with a low carb diet 

00:01:15.450 --> 00:01:22.740
 there still added a theory for chemical 

00:01:19.500 --> 00:01:26.400
 product indexes and learn from here 

00:01:22.740 --> 00:01:30.060
 a kind of synthesis that is nothing he does not 

00:01:26.400 --> 00:01:34.340
 came up he just took a lot of heap 

00:01:30.060 --> 00:01:35.460
 information all connected it well 

00:01:34.340 --> 00:01:39.259
 propiaril 

00:01:35.460 --> 00:01:40.799
 and sold to you that is why now 

00:01:39.259 --> 00:01:42.780
 this diet 

00:01:40.799 --> 00:01:46.560
 she is very popular because 

00:01:42.780 --> 00:01:49.049
 valid in 1 in the first week when 

00:01:46.560 --> 00:01:51.640
 you in the first stage you can lose up 

00:01:49.049 --> 00:01:55.240
 seven pounds kind of like fat 

00:01:51.640 --> 00:01:56.850
 but don't forget that basically 

00:01:55.240 --> 00:01:59.170
 water that is 

00:01:56.850 --> 00:02:04.300
 dehydration as you do not 

00:01:59.170 --> 00:02:05.380
 do not consume carbohydrates here 

00:02:04.300 --> 00:02:07.570
 same happen 

00:02:05.380 --> 00:02:09.550
 Ketone processes, that is 

00:02:07.570 --> 00:02:12.520
 the formation of ketone bodies which 

00:02:09.550 --> 00:02:14.950
 poison your body because first 

00:02:12.520 --> 00:02:16.440
 stage is as I said Kremlin 

00:02:14.950 --> 00:02:20.489
 diet 

00:02:16.440 --> 00:02:22.989
 that's all then you go on 

00:02:20.489 --> 00:02:27.060
 low carb and so go step by step 

00:02:22.989 --> 00:02:30.870
 next and this is a ducana 

00:02:27.060 --> 00:02:33.580
 it's actually cool it's cool but 

00:02:30.870 --> 00:02:36.750
 it works if you use it correctly 

00:02:33.580 --> 00:02:39.600
 but to sort out this variety 

00:02:36.750 --> 00:02:44.380
 need to know about every diet all 

00:02:39.600 --> 00:02:48.959
 thoroughly need to know about the Kremlin 

00:02:44.380 --> 00:02:52.570
 us diets and such a factor as 

00:02:48.959 --> 00:02:54.760
 gluconeogenesis this is such a new one 

00:02:52.570 --> 00:02:57.900
 concept may be a little about him for a long time 

00:02:54.760 --> 00:03:01.690
 few people know i say very often this 

00:02:57.900 --> 00:03:03.430
 telling secrets in my video course 

00:03:01.690 --> 00:03:07.390
 sports diet 

00:03:03.430 --> 00:03:10.630
 but with all these positive 

00:03:07.390 --> 00:03:12.989
 unfortunately there are many qualities 

00:03:10.630 --> 00:03:15.989
 negative qualities and since i don't 

00:03:12.989 --> 00:03:19.540
 I advise beginners to resort to 

00:03:15.989 --> 00:03:22.120
 low-carb and Kremlin diets without 

00:03:19.540 --> 00:03:25.150
 control your coach there either a 

00:03:22.120 --> 00:03:27.430
 some kind of dietary consultant 

00:03:25.150 --> 00:03:31.540
 competent to the same consultant 

00:03:27.430 --> 00:03:35.560
 never touch these diets because 

00:03:31.540 --> 00:03:38.650
 they have many advantages, but if you donâ€™t 

00:03:35.560 --> 00:03:41.590

00:03:38.650 --> 00:03:44.799
