00:00:05.899 --> 00:00:10.980
 I hope I am fine as far as I am concerned 

00:00:08.880 --> 00:00:13.830
 I want you to do it before you start 

00:00:10.980 --> 00:00:15.750
 personally wish the fund year and 

00:00:13.830 --> 00:00:19.830
 that we have our good intentions until the 

00:00:15.750 --> 00:00:21.890
 Pull through until the end of the year 

00:00:19.830 --> 00:00:24.869
 again after a month 

00:00:21.890 --> 00:00:27.119
 Let's forget about everyone 

00:00:24.869 --> 00:00:29.640
 case I was after my video what 

00:00:27.119 --> 00:00:33.450
 have uploaded where I five you 

00:00:29.640 --> 00:00:35.670
 shown to six six have I with 

00:00:33.450 --> 00:00:38.309
 waits I'm quite often asked where I 

00:00:35.670 --> 00:00:40.379
 these days what I have used and 

00:00:38.309 --> 00:00:42.989
 that i have the bought we keep 

00:00:40.379 --> 00:00:45.149
 I did it myself because I did not have it before 

00:00:42.989 --> 00:00:50.520
 I always normal to sports fans 

00:00:45.149 --> 00:00:52.590
 continuing or torn undergo 

00:00:50.520 --> 00:00:55.680
 has the workers' chamber want with my 

00:00:52.590 --> 00:00:58.469
 Do it well and think so 

00:00:55.680 --> 00:01:00.379
 just a very short is a very stable 

00:00:58.469 --> 00:01:04.609
 and not rice and what I then stop 

00:01:00.379 --> 00:01:04.609
 still handy because of it really stuck 

00:01:05.060 --> 00:01:09.630
 are super as I wanted to completely 

00:01:07.229 --> 00:01:12.360
 I have done that and it is 

00:01:09.630 --> 00:01:14.570
 super easy the totally fast though 

00:01:12.360 --> 00:01:15.920
 just because I was so often asked 

00:01:14.570 --> 00:01:20.930
 I thought I told you this is coming 

00:01:15.920 --> 00:01:23.930
 so if you want to know her, you want to know her 

00:01:20.930 --> 00:01:34.850
 cabaret or hdmi get for brands 

00:01:23.930 --> 00:01:37.550
 then just tune it all for her 

00:01:34.850 --> 00:01:40.340
 your hair band or port is needed 

00:01:37.550 --> 00:01:43.670
 still does not need the scissors and 

00:01:40.340 --> 00:01:45.140
 any white pen I 'm out of 

00:01:43.670 --> 00:01:48.200
 which in some already own 

00:01:45.140 --> 00:01:51.080
 cut and yes I have the last one 

00:01:48.200 --> 00:01:52.460
 because I'm the step well 

00:01:51.080 --> 00:01:53.380
 because I have to bacon him 

00:01:52.460 --> 00:01:55.640
 ham 

00:01:53.380 --> 00:01:58.820
 now she can not carry any more thought 

00:01:55.640 --> 00:02:01.940
 I use something to you so what 

00:01:58.820 --> 00:02:05.509
 you need for yours is one 

00:02:01.940 --> 00:02:06.920
 rectangular shape of elegance and her 

00:02:05.509 --> 00:02:10.519
 can you her but can also free 

00:02:06.920 --> 00:02:12.830
 I just like to cut it by hand 

00:02:10.519 --> 00:02:16.370
 unfair to her what it should look like 

00:02:12.830 --> 00:02:19.100
 because I like you and the rectangle 

00:02:16.370 --> 00:02:21.350
 that is important that it is long enough 

00:02:19.100 --> 00:02:23.420
 otherwise we would not be tied with the band 

00:02:21.350 --> 00:02:26.360
 your brakes are coming and you want about 

00:02:23.420 --> 00:02:27.830
 one and a half times make your hand left 

00:02:26.360 --> 00:02:30.950
 i have pretty big hands of youth 

00:02:27.830 --> 00:02:34.459
 for me relatively long but longer than at 

00:02:30.950 --> 00:02:37.430
 salt shorter and what I do it myself 

00:02:34.459 --> 00:02:40.489
 Just put my hand up here 

00:02:37.430 --> 00:02:43.510
 mark where my hand starts when you 

00:02:40.489 --> 00:02:43.510
 pen would write 

00:02:44.769 --> 00:02:51.640
 Here's my hand on it and then take it 

00:02:48.980 --> 00:02:55.400
 I half again 

00:02:51.640 --> 00:02:58.280
 that's the length of 

00:02:55.400 --> 00:03:11.060
 our band and you want your band 

00:02:58.280 --> 00:03:13.310
 make about three fingers wide if 

00:03:11.060 --> 00:03:15.700
 have their markings cuts her 

00:03:13.310 --> 00:03:15.700
 out 

00:03:24.500 --> 00:03:31.470
 when you're done you have then 

00:03:26.819 --> 00:03:32.189
 really not at all 

00:03:31.470 --> 00:03:34.650
 to be perfect 

00:03:32.189 --> 00:03:40.170
 because if you do you use as a belt 

00:03:34.650 --> 00:03:42.200
 it stretches anyway and the edges 

00:03:40.170 --> 00:03:45.260
 then roll one pulls 

00:03:42.200 --> 00:03:48.329
 neat as it is now with the 

00:03:45.260 --> 00:03:52.950
 fight even though that's why 

00:03:48.329 --> 00:03:54.720
 It's important that you do not make it too thin 

00:03:52.950 --> 00:03:56.489
 So it should be a good one 

00:03:54.720 --> 00:03:58.920
 width also have a good countries with 

00:03:56.489 --> 00:04:02.310
 you get around the world and good ones 

00:03:58.920 --> 00:04:05.190
 Spread it so if you use it like that 

00:04:02.310 --> 00:04:07.530
 is on land it can not tear 

00:04:05.190 --> 00:04:10.290
 In any case, I find that more practical 

00:04:07.530 --> 00:04:11.310
 as normal hair ties and so can 

00:04:10.290 --> 00:04:14.299
 you then decide how 

00:04:11.310 --> 00:04:14.299
 you decided to drive it 

00:04:31.540 --> 00:04:33.660
 the
