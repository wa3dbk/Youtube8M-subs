00:00:03.100 --> 00:00:09.079
 who has never played a bonus phase or a 

00:00:06.980 --> 00:00:11.240
 same special stage 

00:00:09.079 --> 00:00:14.809
 generally are phases that give you more 

00:00:11.240 --> 00:00:17.390
 currency points life or whatever 

00:00:14.809 --> 00:00:20.630
 the important thing is that these phases 

00:00:17.390 --> 00:00:21.650
 have played an essential role in games 

00:00:20.630 --> 00:00:24.529
 ancient 

00:00:21.650 --> 00:00:28.279
 Do you remember that bonus phase of sonic? 

00:00:24.529 --> 00:00:30.919
 is the one that gave even a headache that 

00:00:28.279 --> 00:00:34.039
 everything would turn and you needed 

00:00:30.919 --> 00:00:37.129
 to hit in certain places to generate 

00:00:34.039 --> 00:00:40.780
 one side or the other, it is admitted that 

00:00:37.129 --> 00:00:40.780
 Traumatic means this bonus 

00:00:43.980 --> 00:00:48.500
 the law 

00:00:49.880 --> 00:00:57.150
 and later on sonic 2 came one of the 

00:00:54.120 --> 00:01:00.120
 most nostalgic bonus stages at least 

00:00:57.150 --> 00:01:02.850
 For me you remember one in which sonic 

00:01:00.120 --> 00:01:05.850
 I was running and you've been since 

00:01:02.850 --> 00:01:08.630
 several bombs at the end could 

00:01:05.850 --> 00:01:08.630
 Diamond 

00:01:22.700 --> 00:01:29.400
 because it is nostalgia even and the classic 

00:01:26.700 --> 00:01:30.600
 bonus of the street fighter and if everyone 

00:01:29.400 --> 00:01:33.409
 knows 

00:01:30.600 --> 00:01:37.140
 You had to destroy barrels cars. 

00:01:33.409 --> 00:01:41.780
 Bricks would come out kicking all one of the most 

00:01:37.140 --> 00:01:41.780
 Famous of the very crazy story 

00:01:45.600 --> 00:01:48.080
 O 

00:01:48.320 --> 00:01:53.979
 and since we are talking about games of 

00:01:51.140 --> 00:01:57.110
 fight has also the bonus of the deadly kombat 

00:01:53.979 --> 00:02:00.110
 Could you tell me you're mad? 

00:01:57.110 --> 00:02:01.700
 several things you literally tested 

00:02:00.110 --> 00:02:13.700
 your power 

00:02:01.700 --> 00:02:17.120
 everything boy donkey kong country is also a 

00:02:13.700 --> 00:02:19.700
 game full of bonus stages and the legal is 

00:02:17.120 --> 00:02:23.840
 that in these phases you played with several 

00:02:19.700 --> 00:02:27.080
 animals like frogs in the seront fish and even 

00:02:23.840 --> 00:02:30.110
 even with an ostrich and a better yet 

00:02:27.080 --> 00:02:33.260
 is that these phases were epic 

00:02:30.110 --> 00:02:36.280
 their soundtrack was very striking 

00:02:33.260 --> 00:02:36.280
 and still there 

00:02:48.580 --> 00:02:54.890
 the lion king or rather the king 

00:02:52.400 --> 00:02:57.950
 lion also had a bonus stage 

00:02:54.890 --> 00:03:00.890
 Interesting, but difficult. I'm talking. 

00:02:57.950 --> 00:03:04.340
 of the mega-drive game that became famous 

00:03:00.890 --> 00:03:07.220
 for being very good but for being difficult 

00:03:04.340 --> 00:03:09.880
 The game was impossible. 

00:03:07.220 --> 00:03:13.490
 the bonus worked like that 

00:03:09.880 --> 00:03:16.250
 the rudder was playing some insects 

00:03:13.490 --> 00:03:19.250
 down and you playing with the dove 

00:03:16.250 --> 00:03:22.010
 should catch these insects only that it was 

00:03:19.250 --> 00:03:25.040
 very fast and if an insect 

00:03:22.010 --> 00:03:27.500
 on the ground you lost and this is a 

00:03:25.040 --> 00:03:28.760
 of those bonuses that you only discover 

00:03:27.500 --> 00:03:31.660
 what do you have to do? 

00:03:28.760 --> 00:03:31.660
 after hours 

00:03:34.870 --> 00:03:42.069
 the elegant king in bandicoot crash as well 

00:03:39.489 --> 00:03:45.040
 there are bonus stages are small 

00:03:42.069 --> 00:03:47.769
 platforms that if you climb on them will 

00:03:45.040 --> 00:04:02.620
 straight to the stage you get many 

00:03:47.769 --> 00:04:05.500
 apples short life you remember it is 

00:04:02.620 --> 00:04:08.739
 seeing from this side the bonus stages were 

00:04:05.500 --> 00:04:11.500
 very epic were very striking and 

00:04:08.739 --> 00:04:13.750

00:04:11.500 --> 00:04:15.190
