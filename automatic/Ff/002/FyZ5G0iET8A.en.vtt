00:04:16.310 --> 00:04:16.320 
really weird that

00:04:16.320 --> 00:04:18.380 
really weird that
you<00:04:16.410> would<00:04:16.590> play<00:04:17.370> both<00:04:17.610> of<00:04:17.640> these<00:04:17.880> guys<00:04:18.120> out

00:04:18.380 --> 00:04:18.390 
you would play both of these guys out

00:04:18.390 --> 00:04:22.610 
you would play both of these guys out
and<00:04:18.710> then<00:04:19.710> double<00:04:20.400> block<00:04:20.610> and<00:04:20.850> then<00:04:21.620> recover

00:04:22.610 --> 00:04:22.620 
and then double block and then recover

00:04:22.620 --> 00:04:27.410 
and then double block and then recover
with<00:04:22.890> only<00:04:23.100> this<00:04:25.520> I'm<00:04:26.520> just<00:04:26.790> going<00:04:26.940> to<00:04:27.000> go<00:04:27.090> for

00:04:27.410 --> 00:04:27.420 
with only this I'm just going to go for

00:04:27.420 --> 00:04:29.870 
with only this I'm just going to go for
it<00:04:27.510> if<00:04:27.660> he<00:04:27.750> doesn't<00:04:28.110> have<00:04:28.230> it<00:04:28.610> it's<00:04:29.610> just

00:04:29.870 --> 00:04:29.880 
it if he doesn't have it it's just

00:04:29.880 --> 00:04:32.390 
it if he doesn't have it it's just
really<00:04:30.030> high<00:04:30.210> upside<00:04:30.540> for<00:04:30.750> us<00:04:31.040> it<00:04:32.040> doesn't

00:04:32.390 --> 00:04:32.400 
really high upside for us it doesn't

00:04:32.400 --> 00:04:34.040 
really high upside for us it doesn't
feel<00:04:32.520> like<00:04:32.700> he<00:04:32.850> necessarily<00:04:33.240> has<00:04:33.570> to<00:04:33.600> have<00:04:33.870> it

00:04:34.040 --> 00:04:34.050 
feel like he necessarily has to have it

00:04:34.050 --> 00:04:35.480 
feel like he necessarily has to have it
although<00:04:34.470> it<00:04:34.590> does<00:04:34.740> feel<00:04:34.920> like<00:04:35.040> he<00:04:35.160> does<00:04:35.310> have

00:04:35.480 --> 00:04:35.490 
although it does feel like he does have

00:04:35.490 --> 00:04:45.170 
although it does feel like he does have
it<00:04:35.610> sometimes<00:04:40.430> it<00:04:41.430> was<00:04:41.520> all<00:04:41.730> that's<00:04:42.480> good<00:04:44.180> get

00:04:51.130 --> 00:04:51.140 

00:04:51.140 --> 00:04:53.540
