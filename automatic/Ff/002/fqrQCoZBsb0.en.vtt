it'll be completely optional a lot of it

it'll be completely optional a lot of it
will<00:01:48.119> be<00:01:48.149> optional<00:01:48.780> there<00:01:48.990> might<00:01:49.140> be<00:01:49.170> parts

00:01:49.550 --> 00:01:49.560 
will be optional there might be parts

00:01:49.560 --> 00:01:50.719 
will be optional there might be parts
that<00:01:49.710> are<00:01:49.799> actually<00:01:49.920> introduced<00:01:50.430> through<00:01:50.640> the

00:01:50.719 --> 00:01:50.729 
that are actually introduced through the

00:01:50.729 --> 00:01:53.060 
that are actually introduced through the
story<00:01:50.970> we<00:01:51.180> like<00:01:51.329> to<00:01:51.479> leave<00:01:51.630> it<00:01:51.659> together<00:01:52.070> the

00:01:53.060 --> 00:01:53.070 
story we like to leave it together the

00:01:53.070 --> 00:01:54.530 
story we like to leave it together the
big<00:01:53.220> thing<00:01:53.250> obviously<00:01:53.610> to<00:01:53.939> make<00:01:54.090> sure<00:01:54.240> is<00:01:54.390> that

00:01:54.530 --> 00:01:54.540 
big thing obviously to make sure is that

00:01:54.540 --> 00:01:58.100 
big thing obviously to make sure is that
those<00:01:54.689> parts<00:01:55.049> are<00:01:55.430> not<00:01:56.430> so<00:01:56.880> challenging<00:01:57.869> that

00:01:58.100 --> 00:01:58.110 
those parts are not so challenging that

00:01:58.110 --> 00:02:00.020 
those parts are not so challenging that
somebody<00:01:58.860> who's<00:01:59.070> more<00:01:59.310> of<00:01:59.399> the<00:01:59.520> ground<00:01:59.759> gamer

somebody who's more of the ground gamer

you're going to be doing any of that

00:02:10.410 --> 00:02:12.110 
you're going to be doing any of that
stuff<00:02:10.649> and<00:02:10.950> you're<00:02:11.340> really<00:02:11.520> into<00:02:11.879> space

00:02:12.110 --> 00:02:12.120 
stuff and you're really into space

stuff and you're really into space
combat<00:02:12.360> that's<00:02:12.720> going<00:02:12.870> to<00:02:12.930> be<00:02:12.989> something

00:02:13.160 --> 00:02:13.170 
combat that's going to be something

00:02:15.320 --> 00:02:15.330 
you're deciding to go do and what's

00:02:15.330 --> 00:02:17.030 
you're deciding to go do and what's
what's<00:02:15.599> the<00:02:15.750> ultimate<00:02:15.870> payoff<00:02:16.319> for<00:02:16.709> kind<00:02:16.920> of

00:02:17.030 --> 00:02:17.040 
what's the ultimate payoff for kind of

00:02:17.040 --> 00:02:18.740 
what's the ultimate payoff for kind of
participating<00:02:17.670> in<00:02:17.879> the<00:02:17.970> space<00:02:18.180> combat<00:02:18.420> well

00:02:18.740 --> 00:02:18.750 
participating in the space combat well

00:02:18.750 --> 00:02:20.720 
participating in the space combat well
you<00:02:18.870> have<00:02:19.050> access<00:02:19.500> to<00:02:19.530> things<00:02:19.920> that<00:02:20.099> you<00:02:20.640> know

00:02:20.720 --> 00:02:20.730 
you have access to things that you know

00:02:20.730 --> 00:02:22.130 
you have access to things that you know
nobody<00:02:21.090> else<00:02:21.239> is<00:02:21.360> going<00:02:21.450> to<00:02:21.510> have<00:02:21.660> access<00:02:22.020> to

00:02:22.130 --> 00:02:22.140 
nobody else is going to have access to

00:02:22.140 --> 00:02:23.930 
nobody else is going to have access to
if<00:02:22.230> they<00:02:22.349> don't<00:02:22.560> really<00:02:22.739> take<00:02:23.459> advantage<00:02:23.610> of

00:02:23.930 --> 00:02:23.940 
if they don't really take advantage of

00:02:23.940 --> 00:02:26.059 
if they don't really take advantage of
that<00:02:24.000> feature<00:02:24.620> absolutely<00:02:25.620> we're<00:02:25.770> trying<00:02:26.010> to

00:02:26.059 --> 00:02:26.069 
that feature absolutely we're trying to

00:02:26.069 --> 00:02:28.190 
that feature absolutely we're trying to
also<00:02:26.220> make<00:02:26.550> their<00:02:26.910> be<00:02:27.150> several<00:02:27.720> paths<00:02:27.959> to

00:02:28.190 --> 00:02:28.200 
also make their be several paths to

00:02:28.200 --> 00:02:31.640 
also make their be several paths to
reward<00:02:28.530> so<00:02:28.980> if<00:02:29.640> let's<00:02:30.269> say<00:02:30.390> you<00:02:31.140> really<00:02:31.170> want

00:02:31.640 --> 00:02:31.650 
reward so if let's say you really want

00:02:31.650 --> 00:02:32.839 
reward so if let's say you really want
to<00:02:31.739> get<00:02:31.860> that<00:02:32.069> last<00:02:32.310> little<00:02:32.519> bit<00:02:32.819> of

00:02:32.839 --> 00:02:32.849 
to get that last little bit of

00:02:32.849 --> 00:02:34.550 
to get that last little bit of
experience<00:02:33.269> points<00:02:33.599> before<00:02:33.930> you<00:02:34.200> go<00:02:34.319> to<00:02:34.379> your

00:02:34.550 --> 00:02:34.560 
experience points before you go to your

00:02:34.560 --> 00:02:35.940 
experience points before you go to your
next<00:02:34.680> flashpoint

00:02:35.940 --> 00:02:35.950 
next flashpoint

00:02:35.950 --> 00:02:37.380 
next flashpoint
we<00:02:36.250> want<00:02:36.430> to<00:02:36.520> make<00:02:36.610> sure<00:02:36.640> that<00:02:37.000> there<00:02:37.120> are<00:02:37.209> lots

00:02:37.380 --> 00:02:37.390 
we want to make sure that there are lots

00:02:37.390 --> 00:02:39.030 
we want to make sure that there are lots
of<00:02:37.480> different<00:02:37.780> ways<00:02:37.810> to<00:02:38.080> do<00:02:38.200> that<00:02:38.379> so<00:02:38.860> we're

00:02:39.030 --> 00:02:39.040 
of different ways to do that so we're

00:02:39.040 --> 00:02:41.009 
of different ways to do that so we're
exploring<00:02:39.459> things<00:02:39.730> like<00:02:40.060> giving<00:02:40.420> XP<00:02:40.720> for

00:02:41.009 --> 00:02:41.019 
exploring things like giving XP for

00:02:41.019 --> 00:02:43.830 
exploring things like giving XP for
space<00:02:41.290> combat<00:02:41.560> giving<00:02:41.980> XV<00:02:42.340> for<00:02:42.840> battlegrounds

00:02:43.830 --> 00:02:43.840 
space combat giving XV for battlegrounds

00:02:43.840 --> 00:02:46.380 
space combat giving XV for battlegrounds
doing<00:02:44.110> that<00:02:44.260> sort<00:02:44.470> of<00:02:44.590> thing<00:02:44.650> so<00:02:45.239> one<00:02:46.239> of<00:02:46.269> the

00:02:46.380 --> 00:02:46.390 
doing that sort of thing so one of the

00:02:46.390 --> 00:02:48.509 
doing that sort of thing so one of the
philosophies<00:02:46.900> we've<00:02:47.110> always<00:02:47.260> had<00:02:47.590> is<00:02:48.099> let<00:02:48.400> the

00:02:48.509 --> 00:02:48.519 
philosophies we've always had is let the

00:02:48.519 --> 00:02:51.119 
philosophies we've always had is let the
players<00:02:48.760> play<00:02:49.150> how<00:02:49.360> they<00:02:49.480> want<00:02:49.660> to<00:02:49.810> play<00:02:50.129> and

00:02:51.119 --> 00:02:51.129 
players play how they want to play and

00:02:51.129 --> 00:02:54.120 
players play how they want to play and
in<00:02:51.580> the<00:02:51.640> play<00:02:52.269> patterns<00:02:52.870> that<00:02:53.560> feel<00:02:53.860> the<00:02:53.980> best

00:02:54.120 --> 00:02:54.130 
in the play patterns that feel the best

00:02:54.130 --> 00:02:56.729 
in the play patterns that feel the best
for<00:02:54.400> them<00:02:54.580> and<00:02:55.050> as<00:02:56.050> far<00:02:56.230> as<00:02:56.349> the<00:02:56.410> rest<00:02:56.590> of<00:02:56.680> the

00:02:56.729 --> 00:02:56.739 
for them and as far as the rest of the

00:02:56.739 --> 00:02:58.259 
for them and as far as the rest of the
game<00:02:56.890> goes<00:02:57.099> so<00:02:57.250> there's<00:02:57.430> eight<00:02:57.580> classes<00:02:58.060> that

00:02:58.259 --> 00:02:58.269 
game goes so there's eight classes that

00:02:58.269 --> 00:02:59.490 
game goes so there's eight classes that
people<00:02:58.540> can<00:02:58.750> choose<00:02:58.900> from<00:02:59.080> as<00:02:59.290> well<00:02:59.319> as

00:02:59.490 --> 00:02:59.500 
people can choose from as well as

00:02:59.500 --> 00:03:01.740 
people can choose from as well as
specializations<00:03:00.250> within<00:03:00.550> those<00:03:00.670> classes<00:03:01.180> how

00:03:01.740 --> 00:03:01.750 
specializations within those classes how

00:03:01.750 --> 00:03:03.150 
specializations within those classes how
are<00:03:01.870> things<00:03:02.049> coming<00:03:02.230> along<00:03:02.470> in<00:03:02.830> terms<00:03:03.040> of

00:03:03.150 --> 00:03:03.160 
are things coming along in terms of

00:03:03.160 --> 00:03:04.589 
are things coming along in terms of
finding<00:03:03.400> the<00:03:03.610> balance<00:03:03.760> between<00:03:04.060> those

00:03:04.589 --> 00:03:04.599 
finding the balance between those

00:03:04.599 --> 00:03:06.539 
finding the balance between those
classes<00:03:05.110> it<00:03:05.290> has<00:03:05.470> have<00:03:06.010> you<00:03:06.099> guys<00:03:06.220> pretty<00:03:06.459> much

00:03:06.539 --> 00:03:06.549 
classes it has have you guys pretty much

00:03:06.549 --> 00:03:08.759 
classes it has have you guys pretty much
settled<00:03:07.060> on<00:03:07.180> a<00:03:07.209> final<00:03:07.299> final<00:03:08.170> point<00:03:08.410> or<00:03:08.560> is<00:03:08.650> it

00:03:08.759 --> 00:03:08.769 
settled on a final final point or is it

00:03:08.769 --> 00:03:11.190 
settled on a final final point or is it
sort<00:03:08.950> of<00:03:08.980> constant<00:03:09.519> constant<00:03:09.970> tweaking<00:03:10.480> we

00:03:11.190 --> 00:03:11.200 
sort of constant constant tweaking we

00:03:11.200 --> 00:03:13.289 
sort of constant constant tweaking we
are<00:03:11.380> nowhere<00:03:11.799> near<00:03:12.040> a<00:03:12.250> final<00:03:12.310> point<00:03:12.790> so<00:03:13.150> what<00:03:13.239> I

00:03:13.289 --> 00:03:13.299 
are nowhere near a final point so what I
