00:00:27.529 --> 00:00:27.539 
to go to surgery and you can see there

00:00:27.539 --> 00:00:29.550 
to go to surgery and you can see there
Jack's<00:00:28.539> right<00:00:28.779> how<00:00:28.960> it<00:00:29.109> doesn't<00:00:29.380> look<00:00:29.500> I

00:00:29.550 --> 00:00:29.560 
Jack's right how it doesn't look I

00:00:29.560 --> 00:00:31.259 
Jack's right how it doesn't look I
understand<00:00:30.010> normal<00:00:30.279> there's<00:00:30.429> some<00:00:30.580> white<00:00:30.820> sky

00:00:31.259 --> 00:00:31.269 
understand normal there's some white sky

00:00:31.269 --> 00:00:34.410 
understand normal there's some white sky
around<00:00:31.449> the<00:00:31.599> tissue<00:00:31.810> going<00:00:32.230> on<00:00:33.030> and<00:00:34.030> the<00:00:34.269> whole

00:00:34.410 --> 00:00:34.420 
around the tissue going on and the whole

00:00:34.420 --> 00:00:35.790 
around the tissue going on and the whole
height<00:00:34.600> self<00:00:34.989> doesn't<00:00:35.170> actually<00:00:35.350> look<00:00:35.620> too

00:00:35.790 --> 00:00:35.800 
height self doesn't actually look too

00:00:35.800 --> 00:00:37.829 
height self doesn't actually look too
healthy<00:00:36.040> but<00:00:36.430> that's<00:00:37.120> actually<00:00:37.330> not<00:00:37.510> Jack's

00:00:37.829 --> 00:00:37.839 
healthy but that's actually not Jack's

00:00:37.839 --> 00:00:41.939 
healthy but that's actually not Jack's
problem<00:00:38.470> we<00:00:39.160> turn<00:00:39.370> Jack<00:00:39.610> around<00:00:40.589> and<00:00:41.589> see<00:00:41.830> the

00:00:41.939 --> 00:00:41.949 
problem we turn Jack around and see the

00:00:41.949 --> 00:00:45.360 
problem we turn Jack around and see the
other<00:00:42.070> idea<00:00:43.320> has<00:00:44.320> got<00:00:44.530> this<00:00:44.650> pink<00:00:44.950> fleshy

00:00:45.360 --> 00:00:45.370 
other idea has got this pink fleshy

00:00:45.370 --> 00:00:48.000 
other idea has got this pink fleshy
growth<00:00:45.670> in<00:00:46.239> it<00:00:46.450> and<00:00:47.170> I<00:00:47.320> actually<00:00:47.469> think<00:00:47.770> what's

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:48.010 
growth in it and I actually think what's

00:00:48.010 --> 00:00:49.920 
growth in it and I actually think what's
happened<00:00:48.340> is<00:00:48.460> that<00:00:48.489> Jack's<00:00:49.090> alive<00:00:49.329> wall<00:00:49.690> has

00:00:49.920 --> 00:00:49.930 
happened is that Jack's alive wall has

00:00:49.930 --> 00:00:52.740 
happened is that Jack's alive wall has
ruptured<00:00:50.170> and<00:00:50.559> that<00:00:51.460> is<00:00:51.610> just<00:00:51.879> what<00:00:52.480> we<00:00:52.510> called

00:00:52.740 --> 00:00:52.750 
ruptured and that is just what we called

00:00:52.750 --> 00:00:55.110 
ruptured and that is just what we called
granulation<00:00:53.289> tissue<00:00:53.320> and<00:00:53.980> so<00:00:54.670> Jack's<00:00:55.000> a

00:00:55.110 --> 00:00:55.120 
granulation tissue and so Jack's a

00:00:55.120 --> 00:00:57.180 
granulation tissue and so Jack's a
chronic<00:00:55.660> problem<00:00:55.809> she's<00:00:56.170> she<00:00:56.739> was<00:00:56.860> born<00:00:57.070> with

00:00:57.180 --> 00:00:57.190 
chronic problem she's she was born with

00:00:57.190 --> 00:00:59.520 
chronic problem she's she was born with
bad<00:00:57.370> eyes<00:00:57.579> and<00:00:57.760> in<00:00:57.850> fact<00:00:58.000> a<00:00:58.149> clutch<00:00:58.390> mate<00:00:58.660> also

00:00:59.520 --> 00:00:59.530 
bad eyes and in fact a clutch mate also

00:00:59.530 --> 00:01:01.290 
bad eyes and in fact a clutch mate also
has<00:00:59.859> bad<00:01:00.129> eyes<00:01:00.340> I<00:01:00.370> suspect<00:01:00.910> there's<00:01:01.059> probably

00:01:01.290 --> 00:01:01.300 
has bad eyes I suspect there's probably

00:01:01.300 --> 00:01:02.549 
has bad eyes I suspect there's probably
been<00:01:01.449> a<00:01:01.480> problem<00:01:01.750> during<00:01:02.289> the<00:01:02.469> incubation

00:01:02.549 --> 00:01:02.559 
been a problem during the incubation

00:01:02.559 --> 00:01:05.490 
been a problem during the incubation
process<00:01:03.190> and<00:01:04.030> it's<00:01:04.479> resulted<00:01:04.989> in<00:01:05.080> an<00:01:05.199> abnormal

00:01:05.490 --> 00:01:05.500 
process and it's resulted in an abnormal

00:01:05.500 --> 00:01:07.170 
process and it's resulted in an abnormal
eye<00:01:05.950> for<00:01:06.220> most<00:01:06.399> and<00:01:06.610> actually<00:01:06.880> say<00:01:07.030> that

00:01:07.170 --> 00:01:07.180 
eye for most and actually say that

00:01:07.180 --> 00:01:09.840 
eye for most and actually say that
relatively<00:01:07.630> commonly<00:01:08.080> and<00:01:08.350> in<00:01:08.860> young<00:01:09.610> a<00:01:09.670> bit

00:01:09.840 --> 00:01:09.850 
relatively commonly and in young a bit

00:01:09.850 --> 00:01:12.300 
relatively commonly and in young a bit
of<00:01:09.970> drag<00:01:10.180> and<00:01:10.390> so<00:01:10.630> so<00:01:11.410> my<00:01:11.560> advice<00:01:11.830> for<00:01:12.100> Jack

00:01:12.300 --> 00:01:12.310 
of drag and so so my advice for Jack

00:01:12.310 --> 00:01:13.590 
of drag and so so my advice for Jack
Steiner<00:01:12.550> was<00:01:12.789> that<00:01:12.940> we<00:01:13.000> actually<00:01:13.119> removed

00:01:13.590 --> 00:01:13.600 
Steiner was that we actually removed

00:01:13.600 --> 00:01:15.779 
Steiner was that we actually removed
this<00:01:13.780> eye<00:01:13.960> because<00:01:14.350> it's<00:01:14.560> going<00:01:14.830> to<00:01:15.100> end<00:01:15.640> up

00:01:15.779 --> 00:01:15.789 
this eye because it's going to end up

00:01:15.789 --> 00:01:18.179 
this eye because it's going to end up
just<00:01:15.820> chronically<00:01:16.450> infected<00:01:16.750> it's<00:01:17.710> fairly

00:01:18.179 --> 00:01:18.189 
just chronically infected it's fairly

00:01:18.189 --> 00:01:20.190 
just chronically infected it's fairly
Sawyer<00:01:18.549> touch<00:01:18.909> touch<00:01:19.450> around<00:01:19.659> the<00:01:19.900> eye<00:01:19.930> and

00:01:20.190 --> 00:01:20.200 
Sawyer touch touch around the eye and

00:01:20.200 --> 00:01:22.230 
Sawyer touch touch around the eye and
she<00:01:20.350> doesn't<00:01:20.560> like<00:01:20.860> it<00:01:21.009> too<00:01:21.159> much<00:01:21.310> so<00:01:21.369> we're

00:01:22.230 --> 00:01:22.240 
she doesn't like it too much so we're

00:01:22.240 --> 00:01:24.719 
she doesn't like it too much so we're
gonna<00:01:22.330> take<00:01:22.509> that<00:01:22.570> eye<00:01:22.750> out<00:01:23.080> today<00:01:23.380> and<00:01:23.729> that

00:01:24.719 --> 00:01:24.729 
gonna take that eye out today and that

00:01:24.729 --> 00:01:26.340 
gonna take that eye out today and that
should<00:01:24.909> make<00:01:25.060> a<00:01:25.090> lot<00:01:25.270> more<00:01:25.390> comfortable<00:01:25.810> so

00:01:26.340 --> 00:01:26.350 
should make a lot more comfortable so

00:01:26.350 --> 00:01:27.990 
should make a lot more comfortable so
we've<00:01:26.530> got<00:01:26.680> Jack<00:01:26.860> I<00:01:26.920> need<00:01:27.130> to<00:01:27.250> tie<00:01:27.430> it<00:01:27.490> now<00:01:27.759> and

00:01:27.990 --> 00:01:28.000 
we've got Jack I need to tie it now and

00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:30.899 
we've got Jack I need to tie it now and
hooked<00:01:28.270> up<00:01:28.420> to<00:01:28.689> a<00:01:28.930> ventilator<00:01:28.960> so<00:01:29.799> you'll<00:01:30.790> hear

00:01:30.899 --> 00:01:30.909 
hooked up to a ventilator so you'll hear

00:01:30.909 --> 00:01:32.700 
hooked up to a ventilator so you'll hear
that<00:01:31.090> soft<00:01:31.360> sort<00:01:31.600> of<00:01:31.689> clicking<00:01:32.020> noise<00:01:32.229> that

00:01:32.700 --> 00:01:32.710 
that soft sort of clicking noise that

00:01:32.710 --> 00:01:35.039 
that soft sort of clicking noise that
one<00:01:32.860> in<00:01:33.189> the<00:01:33.400> background<00:01:33.790> that's<00:01:34.000> been<00:01:34.869> a<00:01:34.900> lot

00:01:35.039 --> 00:01:35.049 
one in the background that's been a lot

00:01:35.049 --> 00:01:37.499 
one in the background that's been a lot
of<00:01:35.079> breathing<00:01:35.439> for<00:01:35.680> and<00:01:36.670> we've<00:01:36.880> also<00:01:37.030> a<00:01:37.240> god

00:01:37.499 --> 00:01:37.509 
of breathing for and we've also a god

00:01:37.509 --> 00:01:40.080 
of breathing for and we've also a god
thing<00:01:37.750> what's<00:01:38.170> called<00:01:38.350> a<00:01:38.380> pulse<00:01:38.619> doppler<00:01:39.090> on

00:01:40.080 --> 00:01:40.090 
thing what's called a pulse doppler on

00:01:40.090 --> 00:01:43.139 
thing what's called a pulse doppler on
her<00:01:40.360> heart<00:01:41.369> and<00:01:42.369> in<00:01:42.520> the<00:01:42.579> background<00:01:42.790> you<00:01:43.030> know

00:01:43.139 --> 00:01:43.149 
her heart and in the background you know

00:01:43.149 --> 00:01:44.520 
her heart and in the background you know
that<00:01:43.299> sort<00:01:43.450> of<00:01:43.509> pushing<00:01:44.079> noise<00:01:44.259> that's

00:01:44.520 --> 00:01:44.530 
that sort of pushing noise that's

00:01:44.530 --> 00:01:47.039 
that sort of pushing noise that's
actually<00:01:44.950> her<00:01:45.189> heartbeat<00:01:45.700> so<00:01:46.000> so<00:01:46.750> we<00:01:46.899> have<00:01:47.020> a

00:01:47.039 --> 00:01:47.049 
actually her heartbeat so so we have a

00:01:47.049 --> 00:01:48.569 
actually her heartbeat so so we have a
look<00:01:47.170> at<00:01:47.229> her<00:01:47.290> eye<00:01:47.320> pretty<00:01:48.040> much<00:01:48.189> it's<00:01:48.369> a<00:01:48.430> bit

00:01:48.569 --> 00:01:48.579 
look at her eye pretty much it's a bit

00:01:48.579 --> 00:01:49.710 
look at her eye pretty much it's a bit
of<00:01:48.640> a<00:01:48.670> mess<00:01:48.850> so<00:01:49.060> there's<00:01:49.240> all<00:01:49.360> this<00:01:49.450> sort<00:01:49.689> of

00:01:49.710 --> 00:01:49.720 
of a mess so there's all this sort of

00:01:49.720 --> 00:01:52.499 
of a mess so there's all this sort of
pink<00:01:49.930> tissue<00:01:50.110> here<00:01:50.610> and<00:01:51.610> that's<00:01:52.299> the

00:01:52.499 --> 00:01:52.509 
pink tissue here and that's the

00:01:52.509 --> 00:01:54.539 
pink tissue here and that's the
granulation<00:01:53.079> tissue<00:01:53.110> so<00:01:53.710> her<00:01:53.890> eyeball<00:01:54.340> has

00:01:54.539 --> 00:01:54.549 
granulation tissue so her eyeball has

00:01:54.549 --> 00:01:56.789 
granulation tissue so her eyeball has
actually<00:01:55.000> ruptured<00:01:55.390> and<00:01:55.600> started<00:01:56.409> to<00:01:56.530> heal

00:01:56.789 --> 00:01:56.799 
actually ruptured and started to heal

00:01:56.799 --> 00:01:58.950 
actually ruptured and started to heal
and<00:01:57.210> it's<00:01:58.210> healing<00:01:58.570> with<00:01:58.659> this<00:01:58.750> sort<00:01:58.930> of

00:01:58.950 --> 00:01:58.960 
and it's healing with this sort of

00:01:58.960 --> 00:02:01.830 
and it's healing with this sort of
granulation<00:01:59.560> tissue<00:02:00.240> and<00:02:01.240> it's<00:02:01.450> been<00:02:01.600> a<00:02:01.630> mess

00:02:01.830 --> 00:02:01.840 
granulation tissue and it's been a mess

00:02:01.840 --> 00:02:04.770 
granulation tissue and it's been a mess
really<00:02:02.200> so<00:02:02.579> so<00:02:03.579> the<00:02:03.880> first<00:02:03.909> stage<00:02:04.299> of<00:02:04.509> the<00:02:04.750> I

00:02:04.770 --> 00:02:04.780 
really so so the first stage of the I

00:02:04.780 --> 00:02:05.910 
really so so the first stage of the I
remember<00:02:05.259> there's<00:02:05.409> a<00:02:05.439> couple<00:02:05.590> different

00:02:05.910 --> 00:02:05.920 
remember there's a couple different

00:02:05.920 --> 00:02:07.980 
remember there's a couple different
techniques<00:02:06.100> for<00:02:06.490> taking<00:02:06.790> you<00:02:06.880> and<00:02:06.969> I<00:02:07.149> well

00:02:07.980 --> 00:02:07.990 
techniques for taking you and I well

00:02:07.990 --> 00:02:09.760 
techniques for taking you and I well
technique<00:02:08.619> I<00:02:08.739> use<00:02:09.009> is<00:02:09.220> I'm<00:02:09.310> actually

00:02:09.760 --> 00:02:09.770 
technique I use is I'm actually

00:02:09.770 --> 00:02:12.070 
technique I use is I'm actually
stitch<00:02:09.950> those<00:02:10.130> eyes<00:02:10.400> shut<00:02:10.880> first<00:02:11.210> then<00:02:11.960> we'll

00:02:12.070 --> 00:02:12.080 
stitch those eyes shut first then we'll

00:02:12.080 --> 00:02:14.410 
stitch those eyes shut first then we'll
make<00:02:12.200> an<00:02:12.320> incision<00:02:12.590> around<00:02:12.800> the<00:02:13.160> outside<00:02:13.670> go

00:02:14.410 --> 00:02:14.420 
make an incision around the outside go

00:02:14.420 --> 00:02:16.480 
make an incision around the outside go
down<00:02:14.630> behind<00:02:14.780> the<00:02:15.080> eye<00:02:15.110> take<00:02:15.500> the<00:02:15.650> eye<00:02:15.680> out<00:02:15.800> and

00:02:16.480 --> 00:02:16.490 
down behind the eye take the eye out and

00:02:16.490 --> 00:02:18.460 
down behind the eye take the eye out and
I'm<00:02:17.150> hoping<00:02:17.330> that<00:02:17.600> we<00:02:17.810> will<00:02:18.110> be<00:02:18.200> able<00:02:18.320> to

00:02:18.460 --> 00:02:18.470 
I'm hoping that we will be able to

00:02:18.470 --> 00:02:21.070 
I'm hoping that we will be able to
preserve<00:02:18.650> the<00:02:19.160> third<00:02:19.610> eyelid<00:02:20.150> we<00:02:20.840> might<00:02:20.990> be

00:02:21.070 --> 00:02:21.080 
preserve the third eyelid we might be

00:02:21.080 --> 00:02:22.270 
preserve the third eyelid we might be
able<00:02:21.200> to<00:02:21.260> make<00:02:21.350> a<00:02:21.380> bit<00:02:21.560> of<00:02:21.650> a<00:02:21.680> flap<00:02:21.950> to<00:02:22.250> cover

00:02:22.270 --> 00:02:22.280 
able to make a bit of a flap to cover

00:02:22.280 --> 00:02:24.550 
able to make a bit of a flap to cover
the<00:02:22.760> hole<00:02:22.940> and<00:02:23.660> make<00:02:23.840> it<00:02:23.990> look<00:02:24.110> a<00:02:24.290> bit<00:02:24.440> more

00:02:24.550 --> 00:02:24.560 
the hole and make it look a bit more

00:02:24.560 --> 00:02:27.970 
the hole and make it look a bit more
cosmetically<00:02:25.660> nicer<00:02:26.660> so<00:02:27.440> we<00:02:27.530> go<00:02:27.650> ahead<00:02:27.740> and

00:02:27.970 --> 00:02:27.980 
cosmetically nicer so we go ahead and

00:02:27.980 --> 00:02:30.370 
cosmetically nicer so we go ahead and
stitch<00:02:28.280> these<00:02:28.490> eyelid<00:02:28.850> shut<00:02:29.060> and<00:02:29.930> then<00:02:30.230> we'll

00:02:30.370 --> 00:02:30.380 
stitch these eyelid shut and then we'll

00:02:30.380 --> 00:02:32.560 
stitch these eyelid shut and then we'll
come<00:02:30.590> back<00:02:30.620> and<00:02:31.100> start<00:02:31.430> the<00:02:31.550> incision<00:02:31.880> all

00:02:32.560 --> 00:02:32.570 
come back and start the incision all

00:02:32.570 --> 00:02:36.610 
come back and start the incision all
right<00:02:32.720> stitch<00:02:33.170> ladies<00:02:33.500> eyelid<00:02:33.920> shut<00:02:34.160> now<00:02:35.620> but

00:02:36.610 --> 00:02:36.620 
right stitch ladies eyelid shut now but

00:02:36.620 --> 00:02:38.470 
right stitch ladies eyelid shut now but
obviously<00:02:37.070> that<00:02:37.700> decides<00:02:38.060> the<00:02:38.210> problem

00:02:38.470 --> 00:02:38.480 
obviously that decides the problem

00:02:38.480 --> 00:02:40.270 
obviously that decides the problem
underneath<00:02:38.660> so<00:02:38.960> again<00:02:39.200> any<00:02:39.410> time<00:02:39.440> sire<00:02:39.890> so

00:02:40.270 --> 00:02:40.280 
underneath so again any time sire so

00:02:40.280 --> 00:02:42.100 
underneath so again any time sire so
what<00:02:41.030> my<00:02:41.120> plan<00:02:41.330> is<00:02:41.360> is<00:02:41.540> to<00:02:41.690> make<00:02:41.810> an<00:02:42.080> incision

00:02:42.100 --> 00:02:42.110 
what my plan is is to make an incision

00:02:42.110 --> 00:02:47.430 
what my plan is is to make an incision
around<00:02:43.510> where<00:02:44.510> I've<00:02:44.630> stitched<00:02:44.870> it

00:02:47.430 --> 00:02:47.440 

00:02:47.440 --> 00:02:52.250 

and<00:02:49.680> work<00:02:50.680> our<00:02:50.890> way<00:02:51.040> around<00:02:51.160> behind<00:02:51.610> the<00:02:51.820> eye

00:02:52.250 --> 00:02:52.260 
and work our way around behind the eye

00:02:52.260 --> 00:02:54.810 
and work our way around behind the eye
and<00:02:53.260> remember<00:02:53.320> that<00:02:53.890> way<00:02:54.040> so<00:02:54.340> started<00:02:54.670> make

00:02:54.810 --> 00:02:54.820 
and remember that way so started make

00:02:54.820 --> 00:02:56.220 
and remember that way so started make
our<00:02:55.000> incision<00:02:55.240> around<00:02:55.450> the<00:02:55.720> eye

00:02:56.220 --> 00:02:56.230 
our incision around the eye

00:02:56.230 --> 00:02:58.380 
our incision around the eye
they<00:02:57.160> were<00:02:57.220> pretty<00:02:57.430> good<00:02:57.550> blood<00:02:57.700> supply<00:02:57.880> so

00:02:58.380 --> 00:02:58.390 
they were pretty good blood supply so

00:02:58.390 --> 00:03:01.440 
they were pretty good blood supply so
they<00:02:58.570> tend<00:02:59.110> to<00:02:59.170> bleed<00:02:59.410> a<00:02:59.440> little<00:02:59.620> bit<00:03:00.180> but<00:03:01.180> you

00:03:01.440 --> 00:03:01.450 
they tend to bleed a little bit but you

00:03:01.450 --> 00:03:02.910 
they tend to bleed a little bit but you
can<00:03:01.570> see<00:03:01.720> that's<00:03:02.050> the<00:03:02.260> skin<00:03:02.530> and<00:03:02.680> then<00:03:02.770> this

00:03:02.910 --> 00:03:02.920 
can see that's the skin and then this

00:03:02.920 --> 00:03:04.590 
can see that's the skin and then this
pile<00:03:03.190> of<00:03:03.220> white<00:03:03.550> tissue<00:03:03.790> here's<00:03:04.150> what's

00:03:04.590 --> 00:03:04.600 
pile of white tissue here's what's

00:03:04.600 --> 00:03:06.600 
pile of white tissue here's what's
called<00:03:04.810> the<00:03:04.870> conjunct<00:03:05.290> timer<00:03:05.500> and<00:03:06.310> that's

00:03:06.600 --> 00:03:06.610 
called the conjunct timer and that's

00:03:06.610 --> 00:03:08.820 
called the conjunct timer and that's
where<00:03:06.820> we're<00:03:07.000> going<00:03:07.150> to<00:03:07.390> go<00:03:07.660> down<00:03:07.930> the<00:03:08.590> slide

00:03:08.820 --> 00:03:08.830 
where we're going to go down the slide

00:03:08.830 --> 00:03:10.340 
where we're going to go down the slide
that<00:03:08.890> and<00:03:09.340> try<00:03:09.490> and<00:03:09.520> remove<00:03:09.820> the<00:03:10.060> eye

00:03:10.340 --> 00:03:10.350 
that and try and remove the eye

00:03:10.350 --> 00:03:13.010 
that and try and remove the eye
completely<00:03:11.350> surrounded<00:03:12.040> by<00:03:12.160> that<00:03:12.370> tissue

00:03:13.010 --> 00:03:13.020 
completely surrounded by that tissue

00:03:13.020 --> 00:03:14.790 
completely surrounded by that tissue
sometimes<00:03:14.020> it<00:03:14.140> works<00:03:14.290> sometimes<00:03:14.410> it<00:03:14.740> doesn't

00:03:14.790 --> 00:03:14.800 
sometimes it works sometimes it doesn't

00:03:14.800 --> 00:03:19.830 
sometimes it works sometimes it doesn't
so<00:03:16.110> through<00:03:17.110> here<00:03:17.380> and<00:03:18.510> this<00:03:19.510> is<00:03:19.690> the<00:03:19.750> original

00:03:19.830 --> 00:03:19.840 
so through here and this is the original

00:03:19.840 --> 00:03:22.170 
so through here and this is the original
eyelids<00:03:20.410> I<00:03:20.530> stitched<00:03:20.830> shut<00:03:21.070> the<00:03:21.880> eyeball

00:03:22.170 --> 00:03:22.180 
eyelids I stitched shut the eyeball

00:03:22.180 --> 00:03:24.510 
eyelids I stitched shut the eyeball
itself<00:03:22.270> is<00:03:22.600> actually<00:03:22.750> quite<00:03:22.960> friable<00:03:23.770> just

00:03:24.510 --> 00:03:24.520 
itself is actually quite friable just

00:03:24.520 --> 00:03:25.950 
itself is actually quite friable just
fell<00:03:24.700> apart<00:03:24.820> of<00:03:25.180> the<00:03:25.270> touch<00:03:25.480> that<00:03:25.690> so<00:03:25.870> the

00:03:25.950 --> 00:03:25.960 
fell apart of the touch that so the

00:03:25.960 --> 00:03:27.600 
fell apart of the touch that so the
actual<00:03:26.230> eyeball<00:03:26.530> has<00:03:26.710> full<00:03:26.920> eruption<00:03:27.340> to<00:03:27.460> that

00:03:27.600 --> 00:03:27.610 
actual eyeball has full eruption to that

00:03:27.610 --> 00:03:30.090 
actual eyeball has full eruption to that
that's<00:03:28.000> part<00:03:28.360> of<00:03:28.450> the<00:03:28.510> eyeball<00:03:28.810> there<00:03:29.100> and

00:03:30.090 --> 00:03:30.100 
that's part of the eyeball there and

00:03:30.100 --> 00:03:31.320 
that's part of the eyeball there and
what<00:03:30.310> we're<00:03:30.430> doing<00:03:30.460> the<00:03:30.700> moment<00:03:31.000> you're<00:03:31.300> just

00:03:31.320 --> 00:03:31.330 
what we're doing the moment you're just

00:03:31.330 --> 00:03:33.660 
what we're doing the moment you're just
working<00:03:31.660> our<00:03:31.930> way<00:03:31.960> down<00:03:32.110> behind<00:03:32.470> that<00:03:32.770> you<00:03:33.580> can

00:03:33.660 --> 00:03:33.670 
working our way down behind that you can

00:03:33.670 --> 00:03:35.070 
working our way down behind that you can
see<00:03:33.820> the<00:03:33.940> bit<00:03:34.060> of<00:03:34.120> what<00:03:34.270> how<00:03:34.540> these<00:03:34.810> guys<00:03:35.020> can

00:03:35.070 --> 00:03:35.080 
see the bit of what how these guys can

00:03:35.080 --> 00:03:36.690 
see the bit of what how these guys can
to<00:03:35.470> bleed<00:03:35.680> it's<00:03:35.860> got<00:03:36.070> quoting<00:03:36.430> the<00:03:36.520> blood

00:03:36.690 --> 00:03:36.700 
to bleed it's got quoting the blood

00:03:36.700 --> 00:03:38.250 
to bleed it's got quoting the blood
supply<00:03:37.060> around<00:03:37.210> these<00:03:37.540> so<00:03:37.750> we<00:03:37.840> have<00:03:37.960> to<00:03:38.050> try

00:03:38.250 --> 00:03:38.260 
supply around these so we have to try

00:03:38.260 --> 00:03:41.850 
supply around these so we have to try
and<00:03:38.440> minimize<00:03:38.680> that<00:03:39.750> smoke<00:03:40.750> it<00:03:40.870> up<00:03:40.990> and<00:03:41.200> the

00:03:41.850 --> 00:03:41.860 
and minimize that smoke it up and the

00:03:41.860 --> 00:03:44.310 
and minimize that smoke it up and the
clamp<00:03:42.130> here<00:03:42.340> is<00:03:42.490> clamped<00:03:42.850> onto<00:03:43.030> a<00:03:43.570> blood

00:03:44.310 --> 00:03:44.320 
clamp here is clamped onto a blood

00:03:44.320 --> 00:03:46.620 
clamp here is clamped onto a blood
vessel<00:03:44.470> the<00:03:44.710> back<00:03:44.890> of<00:03:45.010> the<00:03:45.070> eye<00:03:45.480> try<00:03:46.480> and

00:03:46.620 --> 00:03:46.630

00:03:46.630 --> 00:03:49.050 
vessel the back of the eye try and
prevent<00:03:46.930> and<00:03:47.380> minimize<00:03:48.040> that<00:03:48.070> bleeding<00:03:48.820> so

00:03:49.050 --> 00:03:49.060 
prevent and minimize that bleeding so

00:03:49.060 --> 00:03:50.520 
prevent and minimize that bleeding so
we'll<00:03:49.240> continue<00:03:49.390> on<00:03:49.720> and<00:03:49.870> get<00:03:49.990> this<00:03:50.080> eyeball

00:03:50.520 --> 00:03:50.530 
we'll continue on and get this eyeball

00:03:50.530 --> 00:03:53.760 
we'll continue on and get this eyeball
out<00:03:51.150> and<00:03:52.150> try<00:03:52.510> and<00:03:52.540> get<00:03:53.200> some<00:03:53.410> degree<00:03:53.709> of

00:03:53.760 --> 00:03:53.770 
out and try and get some degree of

00:03:53.770 --> 00:03:55.470 
out and try and get some degree of
closure<00:03:54.040> over<00:03:54.400> all<00:03:54.700> right<00:03:54.760> so<00:03:54.820> you've<00:03:55.150> got<00:03:55.180> the

00:03:55.470 --> 00:03:55.480 
closure over all right so you've got the

00:03:55.480 --> 00:03:57.170 
closure over all right so you've got the
eye<00:03:55.510> out<00:03:55.810> and<00:03:56.350> you<00:03:56.470> can<00:03:56.590> see<00:03:56.770> it's<00:03:56.890> a<00:03:56.920> pretty

00:03:57.170 --> 00:03:57.180 
eye out and you can see it's a pretty

00:03:57.180 --> 00:04:00.180 
eye out and you can see it's a pretty
gruesome<00:03:58.180> sort<00:03:58.480> of<00:03:58.540> looking<00:03:58.690> hole<00:03:59.160> the<00:04:00.160> eye

00:04:00.180 --> 00:04:00.190 
gruesome sort of looking hole the eye

00:04:00.190 --> 00:04:02.130 
gruesome sort of looking hole the eye
itself<00:04:00.580> came<00:04:00.910> out<00:04:01.120> sort<00:04:01.420> of<00:04:01.450> relatively<00:04:02.020> in

actually keep what's called the third
eyelid<00:04:26.710> intact<00:04:27.710> and<00:04:28.450> that's<00:04:29.450> this<00:04:29.750> little

00:04:29.920 --> 00:04:29.930 
eyelid intact and that's this little

piece of pink tissue just here so what

00:04:32.419 --> 00:04:33.970 
piece of pink tissue just here so what
we're<00:04:32.570> going<00:04:32.690> to<00:04:32.810> do<00:04:33.020> is<00:04:33.139> stitch<00:04:33.380> this<00:04:33.590> across

00:04:33.970 --> 00:04:33.980 
we're going to do is stitch this across

00:04:33.980 --> 00:04:39.340 
we're going to do is stitch this across
that<00:04:34.340> I<00:04:34.580> there<00:04:35.060> to<00:04:35.840> create<00:04:37.330> a<00:04:38.330> sort<00:04:39.050> of<00:04:39.080> I<00:04:39.320> guess

00:04:39.340 --> 00:04:39.350 
that I there to create a sort of I guess

00:04:39.350 --> 00:04:42.040 
that I there to create a sort of I guess
a<00:04:39.530> framework<00:04:40.430> that<00:04:40.850> some<00:04:41.090> scarring<00:04:41.540> can<00:04:41.570> occur

00:04:42.040 --> 00:04:42.050 
a framework that some scarring can occur

00:04:42.050 --> 00:04:45.250 
a framework that some scarring can occur
on<00:04:42.110> and<00:04:42.410> adjust<00:04:42.680> to<00:04:42.830> that<00:04:44.260> minimizes

00:04:45.250 --> 00:04:45.260 
on and adjust to that minimizes

00:04:45.260 --> 00:04:47.290 
on and adjust to that minimizes
post-operative<00:04:46.040> bleeding<00:04:46.180> chances<00:04:47.180> of

00:04:47.290 --> 00:04:47.300 
post-operative bleeding chances of

00:04:47.300 --> 00:04:51.280 
post-operative bleeding chances of
post-op<00:04:47.720> infection<00:04:48.350> and<00:04:49.750> this<00:04:50.750> looks<00:04:51.020> a<00:04:51.169> lot

00:04:51.280 --> 00:04:51.290 
post-op infection and this looks a lot

00:04:51.290 --> 00:04:54.550 
post-op infection and this looks a lot
better<00:04:51.470> than<00:04:51.650> having<00:04:51.950> a<00:04:52.160> big<00:04:52.430> hole<00:04:53.410> in<00:04:54.410> the

00:04:54.550 --> 00:04:54.560 
better than having a big hole in the

00:04:54.560 --> 00:04:56.860 
better than having a big hole in the
surface<00:04:54.740> of<00:04:55.100> the<00:04:55.220> eye<00:04:55.250> across<00:04:56.180> the<00:04:56.479> head<00:04:56.660> there

00:04:56.860 --> 00:04:56.870 
surface of the eye across the head there

00:04:56.870 --> 00:05:02.790 
surface of the eye across the head there
so<00:04:58.240> so<00:04:59.240> we're<00:04:59.360> going<00:04:59.510> to<00:04:59.600> stitch<00:04:59.930> that<00:05:00.169> up

00:05:02.790 --> 00:05:02.800 

00:05:02.800 --> 00:05:05.950 

halfway<00:05:03.800> through<00:05:04.510> putting<00:05:05.510> this<00:05:05.690> third

00:05:05.950 --> 00:05:05.960 
halfway through putting this third

00:05:05.960 --> 00:05:10.300 
halfway through putting this third
eyelid<00:05:06.410> in<00:05:06.979> place<00:05:08.050> and<00:05:09.050> you<00:05:09.290> can<00:05:09.410> see<00:05:09.620> we've

00:05:10.300 --> 00:05:10.310 
eyelid in place and you can see we've

00:05:10.310 --> 00:05:12.610 
eyelid in place and you can see we've
now<00:05:10.340> got<00:05:10.700> that<00:05:10.880> tissue<00:05:11.150> across<00:05:11.600> the<00:05:11.870> hole

00:05:12.610 --> 00:05:12.620 
now got that tissue across the hole

00:05:12.620 --> 00:05:14.469 
now got that tissue across the hole
I've<00:05:13.130> got<00:05:13.370> three<00:05:13.639> stitches<00:05:13.880> in<00:05:14.090> there<00:05:14.330> at<00:05:14.419> the

00:05:14.469 --> 00:05:14.479 
I've got three stitches in there at the

00:05:14.479 --> 00:05:16.540 
I've got three stitches in there at the
moment<00:05:14.510> holding<00:05:15.050> and<00:05:15.169> all<00:05:15.260> in<00:05:15.380> place<00:05:15.590> we're

00:05:16.540 --> 00:05:16.550 
moment holding and all in place we're

00:05:16.550 --> 00:05:18.700 
moment holding and all in place we're
using<00:05:16.700> a<00:05:16.910> suture<00:05:17.180> material<00:05:17.750> called<00:05:17.930> PDS<00:05:18.410> and

00:05:18.700 --> 00:05:18.710 
using a suture material called PDS and

00:05:18.710 --> 00:05:20.380 
using a suture material called PDS and
I'm<00:05:19.310> not<00:05:19.430> sure<00:05:19.580> how<00:05:19.729> well<00:05:19.910> it'll<00:05:20.060> show<00:05:20.240> up<00:05:20.300> the

00:05:20.380 --> 00:05:20.390 
I'm not sure how well it'll show up the

00:05:20.390 --> 00:05:21.940 
I'm not sure how well it'll show up the
video<00:05:20.630> but<00:05:20.840> you<00:05:20.960> can<00:05:20.990> see<00:05:21.200> very<00:05:21.229> very<00:05:21.710> fine

00:05:21.940 --> 00:05:21.950 
video but you can see very very fine

00:05:21.950 --> 00:05:24.130 
video but you can see very very fine
it's<00:05:22.160> about<00:05:22.280> as<00:05:22.580> fine<00:05:22.760> as<00:05:22.970> human<00:05:23.240> hair<00:05:23.419> it's

00:05:24.130 --> 00:05:24.140 
it's about as fine as human hair it's

00:05:24.140 --> 00:05:25.510 
it's about as fine as human hair it's
also<00:05:24.260> very<00:05:24.440> expensive<00:05:24.770> so<00:05:25.130> none<00:05:25.280> tend<00:05:25.460> to

00:05:25.510 --> 00:05:25.520 
also very expensive so none tend to

00:05:25.520 --> 00:05:27.969 
also very expensive so none tend to
waste<00:05:25.700> it<00:05:25.880> but<00:05:26.600> it's<00:05:26.930> dissolvable<00:05:27.440> we<00:05:27.830> don't

00:05:27.969 --> 00:05:27.979 
waste it but it's dissolvable we don't

00:05:27.979 --> 00:05:29.320 
waste it but it's dissolvable we don't
want<00:05:28.100> to<00:05:28.160> take<00:05:28.250> these<00:05:28.370> stitches<00:05:28.669> out<00:05:28.940> it'll

00:05:29.320 --> 00:05:29.330 
want to take these stitches out it'll

00:05:29.330 --> 00:05:31.420 
want to take these stitches out it'll
dissolve<00:05:29.570> at<00:05:29.840> over<00:05:30.050> time<00:05:30.289> and<00:05:31.070> so<00:05:31.220> we're<00:05:31.310> gonna

00:05:31.420 --> 00:05:31.430 
dissolve at over time and so we're gonna

00:05:31.430 --> 00:05:33.880 
dissolve at over time and so we're gonna
work<00:05:31.640> our<00:05:31.850> way<00:05:32.030> around<00:05:32.300> the<00:05:32.720> idea<00:05:33.229> and<00:05:33.470> stitch

00:05:33.880 --> 00:05:33.890 
work our way around the idea and stitch

00:05:33.890 --> 00:05:36.520 
work our way around the idea and stitch
that<00:05:34.130> third<00:05:34.370> eyelid<00:05:34.700> all<00:05:34.789> the<00:05:34.940> way<00:05:35.060> around<00:05:35.530> and

00:05:36.520 --> 00:05:36.530 
that third eyelid all the way around and

00:05:36.530 --> 00:05:38.560 
that third eyelid all the way around and
then<00:05:36.770> as<00:05:37.070> I<00:05:37.190> said<00:05:37.250> before<00:05:37.669> will<00:05:37.880> form<00:05:38.479> a

00:05:38.560 --> 00:05:38.570 
then as I said before will form a

00:05:38.570 --> 00:05:41.680 
then as I said before will form a
framework<00:05:38.870> for<00:05:39.080> scarring<00:05:39.919> to<00:05:40.100> occur<00:05:40.690> and

00:05:41.680 --> 00:05:41.690 
framework for scarring to occur and

00:05:41.690 --> 00:05:43.570 
framework for scarring to occur and
ultimately<00:05:42.350> these<00:05:42.530> cosmetically<00:05:43.310> he'll<00:05:43.460> like

00:05:43.570 --> 00:05:43.580 
ultimately these cosmetically he'll like

00:05:43.580 --> 00:05:46.840 
ultimately these cosmetically he'll like
really<00:05:43.820> well<00:05:43.970> and<00:05:44.470> the<00:05:45.470> lizards<00:05:45.830> that<00:05:45.890> have

00:05:46.840 --> 00:05:46.850 
really well and the lizards that have

00:05:46.850 --> 00:05:48.940 
really well and the lizards that have
had<00:05:47.000> this<00:05:47.120> surgery<00:05:47.390> go<00:05:48.080> on<00:05:48.229> and<00:05:48.380> live<00:05:48.500> a<00:05:48.590> normal

00:05:48.940 --> 00:05:48.950 
had this surgery go on and live a normal

00:05:48.950 --> 00:05:52.180 
had this surgery go on and live a normal
healthy<00:05:49.400> off<00:05:50.500> so<00:05:51.500> we're<00:05:51.620> finished<00:05:51.919> stitching

00:05:52.180 --> 00:05:52.190 
healthy off so we're finished stitching

00:05:52.190 --> 00:05:56.710 
healthy off so we're finished stitching
that<00:05:52.520> around<00:05:53.080> the<00:05:54.080> eye<00:05:54.789> so<00:05:55.789> this<00:05:55.940> third<00:05:56.270> eyelid

00:05:56.710 --> 00:05:56.720 
that around the eye so this third eyelid

00:05:56.720 --> 00:05:57.399 
that around the eye so this third eyelid
is

00:05:57.399 --> 00:05:57.409 
is

00:05:57.409 --> 00:05:59.169 
is
positioned<00:05:57.949> all<00:05:58.369> the<00:05:58.459> way<00:05:58.550> around<00:05:58.819> as<00:05:59.089> you<00:05:59.149> can

00:05:59.169 --> 00:05:59.179 
positioned all the way around as you can

00:05:59.179 --> 00:06:01.419 
positioned all the way around as you can
see<00:05:59.479> it<00:05:59.569> forms<00:05:59.929> a<00:06:00.080> nice<00:06:00.229> hover<00:06:00.830> over<00:06:01.099> that<00:06:01.249> hole

00:06:01.419 --> 00:06:01.429 
see it forms a nice hover over that hole

00:06:01.429 --> 00:06:03.279 
see it forms a nice hover over that hole
it<00:06:02.239> looks<00:06:02.269> a<00:06:02.449> lot<00:06:02.569> better<00:06:02.629> than<00:06:02.869> just<00:06:03.139> leaving

00:06:03.279 --> 00:06:03.289 
it looks a lot better than just leaving

00:06:03.289 --> 00:06:06.909 
it looks a lot better than just leaving
it<00:06:03.499> as<00:06:03.589> a<00:06:03.619> big<00:06:03.800> open<00:06:04.179> open<00:06:05.179> gaping<00:06:05.569> hole<00:06:05.749> and<00:06:06.739> so

00:06:06.909 --> 00:06:06.919 
it as a big open open gaping hole and so

00:06:06.919 --> 00:06:08.439 
it as a big open open gaping hole and so
what<00:06:07.069> will<00:06:07.249> happen<00:06:07.669> is<00:06:07.789> this<00:06:07.909> will<00:06:07.969> sort<00:06:08.419> of

00:06:08.439 --> 00:06:08.449 
what will happen is this will sort of

00:06:08.449 --> 00:06:10.359 
what will happen is this will sort of
scar<00:06:08.749> over<00:06:09.050> and<00:06:09.349> scar<00:06:09.709> up<00:06:09.860> we'll<00:06:10.069> get<00:06:10.159> some

00:06:10.359 --> 00:06:10.369 
scar over and scar up we'll get some

00:06:10.369 --> 00:06:12.579 
scar over and scar up we'll get some
skin<00:06:10.639> dry<00:06:10.849> over<00:06:11.089> that<00:06:11.239> and<00:06:11.509> in<00:06:12.349> the<00:06:12.439> next

00:06:12.579 --> 00:06:12.589 
skin dry over that and in the next

00:06:12.589 --> 00:06:14.320 
skin dry over that and in the next
couple<00:06:12.919> of<00:06:12.949> months<00:06:13.099> that<00:06:13.369> will<00:06:13.519> be<00:06:13.669> completely

00:06:14.320 --> 00:06:14.330 
couple of months that will be completely

00:06:14.330 --> 00:06:17.469 
couple of months that will be completely
fully<00:06:14.659> healed<00:06:14.959> so<00:06:16.149> well<00:06:17.149> and<00:06:17.269> all<00:06:17.330> that

00:06:17.469 --> 00:06:17.479 
fully healed so well and all that

00:06:17.479 --> 00:06:19.239 
fully healed so well and all that
surgeries<00:06:17.869> gone<00:06:18.080> well<00:06:18.289> we've<00:06:18.499> taken<00:06:18.739> out<00:06:19.069> that

00:06:19.239 --> 00:06:19.249 
surgeries gone well we've taken out that

00:06:19.249 --> 00:06:22.119 
surgeries gone well we've taken out that
disease<00:06:19.610> die<00:06:19.989> and<00:06:20.989> she<00:06:21.589> should<00:06:21.800> make<00:06:21.949> a<00:06:22.009> full

00:06:22.119 --> 00:06:22.129 
disease die and she should make a full

00:06:22.129 --> 00:06:22.719 
disease die and she should make a full
recovery

00:06:22.719 --> 00:06:22.729 
recovery

00:06:22.729 --> 00:06:24.609 
recovery
so<00:06:23.029> we'll<00:06:23.179> wake<00:06:23.300> up<00:06:23.330> now<00:06:23.689> with<00:06:24.110> some<00:06:24.259> fluids

00:06:24.609 --> 00:06:24.619 
so we'll wake up now with some fluids

00:06:24.619 --> 00:06:26.320 
so we'll wake up now with some fluids
under<00:06:24.800> the<00:06:24.889> skin<00:06:25.099> and<00:06:25.399> probably<00:06:26.059> see<00:06:26.149> some

00:06:26.320 --> 00:06:26.330 
under the skin and probably see some

00:06:26.330 --> 00:06:28.259 
under the skin and probably see some
pain<00:06:26.539> relief<00:06:26.749> and<00:06:26.899> she'll<00:06:27.080> go<00:06:27.169> hamiltonfamily

00:06:28.259 --> 00:06:28.269 
pain relief and she'll go hamiltonfamily

00:06:28.269 --> 00:06:30.339 
pain relief and she'll go hamiltonfamily
and<00:06:29.269> we'll<00:06:29.389> check<00:06:29.569> her<00:06:29.689> again<00:06:29.749> probably<00:06:30.169> about

00:06:30.339 --> 00:06:30.349 
and we'll check her again probably about

00:06:30.349 --> 00:06:32.259 
and we'll check her again probably about
two<00:06:30.589> weeks<00:06:30.800> and<00:06:30.949> I<00:06:31.039> feel<00:06:31.279> she's<00:06:31.459> going<00:06:31.699> ok<00:06:32.059> but

00:06:32.259 --> 00:06:32.269 
two weeks and I feel she's going ok but

00:06:32.269 --> 00:06:34.149 
two weeks and I feel she's going ok but
I<00:06:32.479> wouldn't<00:06:33.349> expect<00:06:33.499> any<00:06:33.829> major

00:06:34.149 --> 00:06:34.159 
I wouldn't expect any major

00:06:34.159 --> 00:06:37.569 
I wouldn't expect any major
complications<00:06:35.059> from<00:06:35.149> that<00:06:35.360> surgery
