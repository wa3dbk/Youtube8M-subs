locations around the world but the two

00:00:19.890 --> 00:00:21.859 
locations around the world but the two
best<00:00:20.130> that<00:00:20.250> I'd<00:00:20.369> say<00:00:20.640> is<00:00:20.670> the<00:00:21.330> one<00:00:21.600> you<00:00:21.689> got<00:00:21.840> in

00:00:21.859 --> 00:00:21.869 
best that I'd say is the one you got in

00:00:21.869 --> 00:00:23.420 
best that I'd say is the one you got in
Draenor<00:00:22.140> village<00:00:22.439> just<00:00:22.590> west<00:00:22.800> of<00:00:22.920> the<00:00:23.010> bankers

00:00:23.420 --> 00:00:23.430 
Draenor village just west of the bankers

00:00:23.430 --> 00:00:24.859 
Draenor village just west of the bankers
it's<00:00:23.760> really<00:00:24.000> easy<00:00:24.119> to<00:00:24.210> bank<00:00:24.449> with<00:00:24.600> that<00:00:24.720> one

00:00:24.859 --> 00:00:24.869 
it's really easy to bank with that one

00:00:24.869 --> 00:00:26.779 
it's really easy to bank with that one
and<00:00:25.019> there's<00:00:25.289> one<00:00:25.320> north<00:00:25.650> of<00:00:25.710> Rd<00:00:26.039> and<00:00:26.250> he<00:00:26.670> does

00:00:26.779 --> 00:00:26.789 
and there's one north of Rd and he does

00:00:26.789 --> 00:00:28.339 
and there's one north of Rd and he does
actually<00:00:26.910> still<00:00:27.180> come<00:00:27.330> as<00:00:27.449> being<00:00:27.660> within<00:00:27.900> our

00:00:28.339 --> 00:00:28.349 
actually still come as being within our

00:00:28.349 --> 00:00:30.470 
actually still come as being within our
dawn<00:00:28.590> area<00:00:28.980> so<00:00:29.189> if<00:00:29.340> you<00:00:29.429> do<00:00:29.519> have<00:00:29.670> the<00:00:29.820> Rd<00:00:30.330> keep

00:00:30.470 --> 00:00:30.480 
dawn area so if you do have the Rd keep

00:00:30.480 --> 00:00:32.150 
dawn area so if you do have the Rd keep
two<00:00:30.750> then<00:00:31.260> that<00:00:31.410> counts<00:00:31.590> so<00:00:31.830> you<00:00:31.920> don't<00:00:32.040> eat<00:00:32.099> to

00:00:32.150 --> 00:00:32.160 
two then that counts so you don't eat to

00:00:32.160 --> 00:00:33.049 
two then that counts so you don't eat to
get<00:00:32.219> the<00:00:32.309> I<00:00:32.340> to<00:00:32.430> keep<00:00:32.579> three<00:00:32.790> for<00:00:32.969> him

00:00:33.049 --> 00:00:33.059 
get the I to keep three for him

00:00:33.059 --> 00:00:34.790 
get the I to keep three for him
providing<00:00:33.899> that<00:00:34.110> you'll<00:00:34.230> be<00:00:34.290> wearing<00:00:34.559> an<00:00:34.680> ID

00:00:34.790 --> 00:00:34.800 
providing that you'll be wearing an ID

00:00:34.800 --> 00:00:36.740 
providing that you'll be wearing an ID
cloak<00:00:35.070> now<00:00:36.030> what's<00:00:36.180> really<00:00:36.329> good<00:00:36.600> about

00:00:36.740 --> 00:00:36.750 
cloak now what's really good about

00:00:36.750 --> 00:00:37.910 
cloak now what's really good about
master<00:00:37.020> farmers<00:00:37.410> is<00:00:37.530> that<00:00:37.620> they<00:00:37.710> can't

00:00:37.910 --> 00:00:37.920 
master farmers is that they can't

00:00:37.920 --> 00:00:39.530 
master farmers is that they can't
actually<00:00:38.070> be<00:00:38.340> spoken<00:00:38.579> to<00:00:38.730> and<00:00:39.090> that<00:00:39.360> their

00:00:39.530 --> 00:00:39.540 
actually be spoken to and that their

00:00:39.540 --> 00:00:40.940 
actually be spoken to and that their
default<00:00:39.840> left<00:00:40.020> lock<00:00:40.200> option<00:00:40.469> will<00:00:40.590> always<00:00:40.860> be

00:00:40.940 --> 00:00:40.950 
default left lock option will always be

00:00:40.950 --> 00:00:42.350 
default left lock option will always be
pickpocket<00:00:41.460> regardless<00:00:41.879> what<00:00:42.000> level<00:00:42.239> you<00:00:42.329> are

00:00:42.350 --> 00:00:42.360 
pickpocket regardless what level you are

00:00:42.360 --> 00:00:44.180 
pickpocket regardless what level you are
so<00:00:42.930> this<00:00:43.110> really<00:00:43.500> does<00:00:43.649> make<00:00:43.770> it<00:00:43.890> easy<00:00:44.040> to

00:00:44.180 --> 00:00:44.190 
so this really does make it easy to

00:00:44.190 --> 00:00:45.950 
so this really does make it easy to
steal<00:00:44.340> from<00:00:44.520> them<00:00:44.700> and<00:00:45.450> instead<00:00:45.750> of<00:00:45.840> your

00:00:45.950 --> 00:00:45.960 
steal from them and instead of your

00:00:45.960 --> 00:00:46.940 
steal from them and instead of your
usual<00:00:45.989> coins<00:00:46.500> you'll<00:00:46.680> get<00:00:46.829> from

00:00:46.940 --> 00:00:46.950 
usual coins you'll get from

00:00:46.950 --> 00:00:48.290 
usual coins you'll get from
pickpocketing<00:00:47.460> you<00:00:47.579> actually<00:00:47.850> get<00:00:48.000> seeds

00:00:48.290 --> 00:00:48.300 
pickpocketing you actually get seeds

00:00:48.300 --> 00:00:49.760 
pickpocketing you actually get seeds
from<00:00:48.510> these<00:00:48.660> guys<00:00:48.870> which<00:00:49.260> is<00:00:49.350> why<00:00:49.469> that's<00:00:49.620> such

00:00:49.760 --> 00:00:49.770 
from these guys which is why that's such

00:00:49.770 --> 00:00:52.160 
from these guys which is why that's such
good<00:00:49.920> money<00:00:50.100> or<00:00:50.340> potential<00:00:50.879> anyway<00:00:51.180> this<00:00:52.050> is

00:00:52.160 --> 00:00:52.170 
good money or potential anyway this is

00:00:52.170 --> 00:00:53.930 
good money or potential anyway this is
because<00:00:52.440> each<00:00:52.680> seed<00:00:52.890> has<00:00:53.010> its<00:00:53.129> own<00:00:53.219> rarity<00:00:53.699> so

00:00:53.930 --> 00:00:53.940 
because each seed has its own rarity so

00:00:53.940 --> 00:00:55.250 
because each seed has its own rarity so
there<00:00:54.180> is<00:00:54.270> a<00:00:54.300> chance<00:00:54.539> that<00:00:54.750> you<00:00:54.809> could<00:00:54.899> get<00:00:55.110> two

00:00:55.250 --> 00:00:55.260 
there is a chance that you could get two

00:00:55.260 --> 00:00:57.410 
there is a chance that you could get two
total<00:00:55.590> seeds<00:00:55.800> into<00:00:56.640> pickpockets<00:00:57.210> which<00:00:57.300> is

00:00:57.410 --> 00:00:57.420 
total seeds into pickpockets which is

00:00:57.420 --> 00:00:59.720 
total seeds into pickpockets which is
always<00:00:57.570> nice<00:00:58.039> there<00:00:59.039> are<00:00:59.160> two<00:00:59.309> thieving

00:00:59.720 --> 00:00:59.730 
always nice there are two thieving

00:00:59.730 --> 00:01:00.950 
always nice there are two thieving
boosting<00:01:00.000> pieces<00:01:00.270> of<00:01:00.390> equipment<00:01:00.539> in<00:01:00.809> this

00:01:00.950 --> 00:01:00.960 
boosting pieces of equipment in this

00:01:00.960 --> 00:01:02.360 
boosting pieces of equipment in this
game<00:01:01.170> I'll<00:01:01.379> be<00:01:01.440> covering<00:01:01.680> both<00:01:01.829> in<00:01:02.010> this<00:01:02.129> video

00:01:02.360 --> 00:01:02.370 
game I'll be covering both in this video

00:01:02.370 --> 00:01:04.250 
game I'll be covering both in this video
but<00:01:02.609> if<00:01:02.969> you<00:01:03.300> have<00:01:03.420> them<00:01:03.600> both<00:01:03.719> then<00:01:04.080> they<00:01:04.199> do

00:01:04.250 --> 00:01:04.260 
but if you have them both then they do

00:01:04.260 --> 00:01:06.560 
but if you have them both then they do
stack<00:01:04.680> so<00:01:05.189> your<00:01:05.729> chances<00:01:05.939> of<00:01:06.150> pickpocketing

00:01:06.560 --> 00:01:06.570 
stack so your chances of pickpocketing

00:01:06.570 --> 00:01:07.910 
stack so your chances of pickpocketing
for<00:01:06.720> a<00:01:06.780> master<00:01:06.990> farmer<00:01:07.229> will<00:01:07.380> be<00:01:07.470> greatly

00:01:07.910 --> 00:01:07.920 
for a master farmer will be greatly

00:01:07.920 --> 00:01:10.219 
for a master farmer will be greatly
increased<00:01:08.240> these<00:01:09.240> are<00:01:09.450> the<00:01:09.570> close<00:01:09.720> of<00:01:09.869> silence

00:01:10.219 --> 00:01:10.229 
increased these are the close of silence

00:01:10.229 --> 00:01:11.750 
increased these are the close of silence

get from the tasks you'll need the two

need<00:02:40.170> almost<00:02:40.349> half<00:02:40.709> your<00:02:40.739> inventory<00:02:41.220> filled

00:02:41.390 --> 00:02:41.400 
need almost half your inventory filled

00:02:41.400 --> 00:02:42.589 
need almost half your inventory filled
with<00:02:41.519> the<00:02:41.579> gloves<00:02:41.760> of<00:02:41.849> silence<00:02:42.180> to<00:02:42.299> be<00:02:42.390> able<00:02:42.510> to

00:02:42.589 --> 00:02:42.599 
with the gloves of silence to be able to

00:02:42.599 --> 00:02:44.600 
with the gloves of silence to be able to
benefit<00:02:42.900> from<00:02:43.049> their<00:02:43.230> boost<00:02:43.409> so<00:02:44.190> because<00:02:44.430> this

00:02:44.600 --> 00:02:44.610 
benefit from their boost so because this

00:02:44.610 --> 00:02:46.220 
benefit from their boost so because this
I<00:02:44.700> just<00:02:44.849> wouldn't<00:02:45.390> really<00:02:45.510> bother<00:02:45.690> trying<00:02:46.079> to

00:02:46.220 --> 00:02:46.230 
I just wouldn't really bother trying to

00:02:46.230 --> 00:02:47.660 
I just wouldn't really bother trying to
pickpocket<00:02:46.379> muster<00:02:46.769> farmers<00:02:47.040> with<00:02:47.160> 30<00:02:47.340> acres

00:02:47.660 --> 00:02:47.670 
pickpocket muster farmers with 30 acres

00:02:47.670 --> 00:02:49.819 
pickpocket muster farmers with 30 acres
it's<00:02:47.790> just<00:02:47.910> too<00:02:48.090> inefficient<00:02:48.569> right<00:02:48.829> so

00:02:49.819 --> 00:02:49.829 
it's just too inefficient right so

00:02:49.829 --> 00:02:51.710 
it's just too inefficient right so
moving<00:02:50.099> on<00:02:50.190> to<00:02:50.280> level<00:02:50.400> 75<00:02:50.790> you<00:02:51.209> can<00:02:51.359> see<00:02:51.540> here

00:02:51.710 --> 00:02:51.720 
moving on to level 75 you can see here

00:02:51.720 --> 00:02:52.789 
moving on to level 75 you can see here
that<00:02:51.810> the<00:02:51.930> rates<00:02:52.079> are<00:02:52.230> much<00:02:52.319> more<00:02:52.560> appealing

00:02:52.789 --> 00:02:52.799 
that the rates are much more appealing

00:02:52.799 --> 00:02:54.860 
that the rates are much more appealing
an<00:02:53.129> average<00:02:53.760> of<00:02:53.879> just<00:02:54.000> one<00:02:54.239> fail<00:02:54.480> per<00:02:54.660> minute

00:02:54.860 --> 00:02:54.870 
an average of just one fail per minute

00:02:54.870 --> 00:02:56.420 
an average of just one fail per minute
means<00:02:55.049> that<00:02:55.260> potentially<00:02:55.799> you'll<00:02:55.950> need<00:02:56.220> one

00:02:56.420 --> 00:02:56.430 
means that potentially you'll need one

00:02:56.430 --> 00:02:57.920 
means that potentially you'll need one
pair<00:02:56.670> of<00:02:56.730> gloves<00:02:57.030> to<00:02:57.180> last<00:02:57.329> you<00:02:57.420> an<00:02:57.510> hour<00:02:57.629> and

00:02:57.920 --> 00:02:57.930 
pair of gloves to last you an hour and

00:02:57.930 --> 00:02:58.940 
pair of gloves to last you an hour and
they<00:02:58.230> could<00:02:58.349> be<00:02:58.440> the<00:02:58.530> ones<00:02:58.560> that<00:02:58.829> you're

00:02:58.940 --> 00:02:58.950 
they could be the ones that you're

00:02:58.950 --> 00:03:01.009 
they could be the ones that you're
wearing<00:02:59.129> this<00:03:00.120> means<00:03:00.359> that<00:03:00.510> you<00:03:00.599> can<00:03:00.750> steal<00:03:00.989> a

00:03:01.009 --> 00:03:01.019 
wearing this means that you can steal a

00:03:01.019 --> 00:03:02.360 
wearing this means that you can steal a
full<00:03:01.230> inventory<00:03:01.409> worth<00:03:01.680> of<00:03:01.829> seeds<00:03:02.010> before<00:03:02.280> you

00:03:02.360 --> 00:03:02.370 
full inventory worth of seeds before you

00:03:02.370 --> 00:03:03.710 
full inventory worth of seeds before you
need<00:03:02.430> to<00:03:02.489> bank<00:03:02.760> now<00:03:03.030> this<00:03:03.390> means<00:03:03.599> it's<00:03:03.690> just

00:03:03.710 --> 00:03:03.720 
need to bank now this means it's just

00:03:03.720 --> 00:03:05.930 
need to bank now this means it's just
much<00:03:03.959> better<00:03:04.109> GP<00:03:04.440> for<00:03:04.620> hours<00:03:04.769> so<00:03:05.040> at<00:03:05.430> level<00:03:05.670> 75

00:03:05.930 --> 00:03:05.940 
much better GP for hours so at level 75

00:03:05.940 --> 00:03:07.130 
much better GP for hours so at level 75
stealing<00:03:06.299> this<00:03:06.420> method<00:03:06.720> is<00:03:06.810> really<00:03:06.930> worth

00:03:07.130 --> 00:03:07.140 
stealing this method is really worth

00:03:07.140 --> 00:03:09.740 
stealing this method is really worth
doing<00:03:07.530> and<00:03:07.739> finally<00:03:08.579> at<00:03:08.700> 99<00:03:09.090> thieving<00:03:09.510> with

00:03:09.740 --> 00:03:09.750 
doing and finally at 99 thieving with

00:03:09.750 --> 00:03:10.880 
doing and finally at 99 thieving with
the<00:03:09.840> two<00:03:09.989> boosts<00:03:10.290> from<00:03:10.440> the<00:03:10.530> cape<00:03:10.680> and<00:03:10.829> the

00:03:10.880 --> 00:03:10.890 
the two boosts from the cape and the

00:03:10.890 --> 00:03:12.259 
the two boosts from the cape and the
gloves<00:03:11.129> you<00:03:11.220> won't<00:03:11.430> actually<00:03:11.819> fail<00:03:12.060> on<00:03:12.209> a

00:03:12.259 --> 00:03:12.269 
gloves you won't actually fail on a

00:03:12.269 --> 00:03:13.670 
gloves you won't actually fail on a
master<00:03:12.540> farmer<00:03:12.900> now<00:03:13.109> this<00:03:13.260> means<00:03:13.409> that<00:03:13.500> you'll

00:03:13.670 --> 00:03:13.680 
master farmer now this means that you'll

00:03:13.680 --> 00:03:14.869 
master farmer now this means that you'll
only<00:03:13.859> ever<00:03:14.010> need<00:03:14.190> the<00:03:14.280> one<00:03:14.400> pair<00:03:14.609> of<00:03:14.640> gloves

00:03:14.869 --> 00:03:14.879 
only ever need the one pair of gloves

00:03:14.879 --> 00:03:15.800 
only ever need the one pair of gloves
they're<00:03:15.150> the<00:03:15.239> ones<00:03:15.390> that<00:03:15.540> you're<00:03:15.629> wielding

00:03:15.800 --> 00:03:15.810 
they're the ones that you're wielding

00:03:15.810 --> 00:03:17.569 
they're the ones that you're wielding
and<00:03:16.200> it<00:03:16.560> means<00:03:16.650> you'll<00:03:16.859> never<00:03:17.010> ever<00:03:17.190> get<00:03:17.400> four

00:03:17.569 --> 00:03:17.579 
and it means you'll never ever get four

00:03:17.579 --> 00:03:18.979 
and it means you'll never ever get four
stunned<00:03:17.790> either<00:03:18.000> so<00:03:18.450> you'll<00:03:18.690> always<00:03:18.870> be

00:03:18.979 --> 00:03:18.989 
stunned either so you'll always be

00:03:18.989 --> 00:03:21.440 
stunned either so you'll always be
making<00:03:19.260> the<00:03:19.349> most<00:03:19.500> people<00:03:19.919> possible<00:03:20.579> so<00:03:21.329> no

00:03:21.440 --> 00:03:21.450 
making the most people possible so no

00:03:21.450 --> 00:03:23.180 
making the most people possible so no
doubt<00:03:21.599> about<00:03:21.720> this<00:03:21.959> but<00:03:22.169> at<00:03:22.290> level<00:03:22.500> 99<00:03:22.709> I<00:03:23.040> would

00:03:23.180 --> 00:03:23.190 
doubt about this but at level 99 I would

00:03:23.190 --> 00:03:24.349 
doubt about this but at level 99 I would
say<00:03:23.280> that<00:03:23.430> this<00:03:23.489> is<00:03:23.639> a<00:03:23.669> viable<00:03:23.880> method<00:03:24.090> of

00:03:24.349 --> 00:03:24.359 
say that this is a viable method of

00:03:24.359 --> 00:03:26.990 
say that this is a viable method of
making<00:03:24.510> money<00:03:25.099> okay<00:03:26.099> so<00:03:26.340> now<00:03:26.489> I'm<00:03:26.609> we<00:03:26.700> want<00:03:26.880> the

00:03:26.990 --> 00:03:27.000 
making money okay so now I'm we want the

00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:29.360 
making money okay so now I'm we want the
actual<00:03:27.150> GP<00:03:27.540> per<00:03:27.660> hour<00:03:27.810> rate<00:03:28.109> this<00:03:28.829> first<00:03:29.099> table

00:03:29.360 --> 00:03:29.370 
actual GP per hour rate this first table

00:03:29.370 --> 00:03:30.650 
actual GP per hour rate this first table
does<00:03:29.459> not<00:03:29.489> account<00:03:29.790> for<00:03:30.000> multiple<00:03:30.120> loot<00:03:30.480> so

00:03:30.650 --> 00:03:30.660 
does not account for multiple loot so

00:03:30.660 --> 00:03:31.759 
does not account for multiple loot so
just<00:03:30.810> assume<00:03:31.019> that<00:03:31.139> these<00:03:31.290> rates<00:03:31.560> are

00:03:31.759 --> 00:03:31.769 
just assume that these rates are

00:03:31.769 --> 00:03:33.500 
just assume that these rates are
accurate<00:03:32.250> for<00:03:32.519> someone<00:03:32.730> with<00:03:32.849> one<00:03:33.120> agility

00:03:33.500 --> 00:03:33.510

00:03:43.129 --> 00:03:43.139 
previous video you can see how someone

you'll<00:03:55.049> be<00:03:55.139> earning<00:03:55.260> over<00:03:55.530> 300<00:03:55.859> K<00:03:56.010> every<00:03:56.190> hour

00:03:56.330 --> 00:03:56.340 
you'll be earning over 300 K every hour

00:03:56.340 --> 00:03:57.830 
you'll be earning over 300 K every hour
with<00:03:56.549> potential<00:03:57.030> for<00:03:57.150> more<00:03:57.299> of<00:03:57.540> course

00:03:57.830 --> 00:03:57.840 
with potential for more of course

00:03:57.840 --> 00:03:59.000 
with potential for more of course
depending<00:03:58.109> on<00:03:58.230> how<00:03:58.290> lucky<00:03:58.410> you<00:03:58.650> get<00:03:58.769> with<00:03:58.889> your

seed drops so as long as you wear the

00:04:01.230 --> 00:04:02.479 
seed drops so as long as you wear the
best<00:04:01.379> gear<00:04:01.560> you<00:04:01.919> should<00:04:01.949> have<00:04:02.099> no<00:04:02.220> problem

00:04:02.479 --> 00:04:02.489 
best gear you should have no problem

finally<00:04:05.879> we<00:04:06.000> move<00:04:06.150> on<00:04:06.239> to<00:04:06.299> the<00:04:06.389> level<00:04:06.540> 99

00:04:06.770 --> 00:04:06.780 
finally we move on to the level 99

00:04:06.780 --> 00:04:08.449 
finally we move on to the level 99
thieving<00:04:07.230> rates<00:04:07.410> now<00:04:07.859> they're<00:04:08.129> not<00:04:08.250> that<00:04:08.400> much

00:04:08.449 --> 00:04:08.459 
thieving rates now they're not that much

00:04:08.459 --> 00:04:10.640 
thieving rates now they're not that much
better<00:04:08.790> than<00:04:08.940> the<00:04:09.000> level<00:04:09.180> 75<00:04:09.449> rates<00:04:09.870> but<00:04:10.169> there

00:04:10.640 --> 00:04:10.650 
better than the level 75 rates but there

00:04:10.650 --> 00:04:12.830 
better than the level 75 rates but there
is<00:04:10.739> a<00:04:10.769> definite<00:04:11.099> increase<00:04:11.220> and<00:04:11.669> it<00:04:12.599> might<00:04:12.810> not

00:04:12.830 --> 00:04:12.840 
is a definite increase and it might not

00:04:12.840 --> 00:04:14.449 
is a definite increase and it might not
seem<00:04:13.079> like<00:04:13.169> much<00:04:13.410> but<00:04:13.470> wait<00:04:13.980> till<00:04:14.129> I<00:04:14.190> apply<00:04:14.400> the

00:04:14.449 --> 00:04:14.459 
seem like much but wait till I apply the

00:04:14.459 --> 00:04:15.949 
seem like much but wait till I apply the
multiple<00:04:14.819> loop<00:04:14.940> values<00:04:15.389> onto<00:04:15.540> these<00:04:15.720> and

00:04:15.949 --> 00:04:15.959 
multiple loop values onto these and

00:04:15.959 --> 00:04:18.039 
multiple loop values onto these and
you'll<00:04:16.590> see<00:04:16.769> how<00:04:16.859> 99<00:04:17.220> really<00:04:17.489> is<00:04:17.579> much<00:04:17.760> better

00:04:18.039 --> 00:04:18.049 
you'll see how 99 really is much better

00:04:18.049 --> 00:04:19.969 
you'll see how 99 really is much better
okay<00:04:19.049> so<00:04:19.079> without<00:04:19.260> any<00:04:19.470> further<00:04:19.680> ado<00:04:19.949> let's

00:04:19.969 --> 00:04:19.979 
okay so without any further ado let's

00:04:19.979 --> 00:04:21.589 
okay so without any further ado let's
move<00:04:20.310> on<00:04:20.400> to<00:04:20.430> the<00:04:20.579> multiple<00:04:20.849> loop<00:04:21.000> rates<00:04:21.209> now

00:04:21.589 --> 00:04:21.599 
move on to the multiple loop rates now

00:04:21.599 --> 00:04:23.959 
move on to the multiple loop rates now
level<00:04:22.229> 38<00:04:22.560> thieving<00:04:23.070> is<00:04:23.219> actually<00:04:23.520> too<00:04:23.669> low<00:04:23.820> to

00:04:23.959 --> 00:04:23.969 
level 38 thieving is actually too low to

00:04:23.969 --> 00:04:25.909 
level 38 thieving is actually too low to
get<00:04:24.090> any<00:04:24.240> multiple<00:04:24.599> loops<00:04:24.750> so<00:04:25.050> I<00:04:25.260> moved<00:04:25.830> around

00:04:25.909 --> 00:04:25.919 
get any multiple loops so I moved around

00:04:25.919 --> 00:04:27.350 
get any multiple loops so I moved around
a<00:04:26.099> lot<00:04:26.190> 75<00:04:26.610> there's<00:04:26.789> no<00:04:26.880> point<00:04:27.090> talking

00:04:27.350 --> 00:04:27.360 
a lot 75 there's no point talking

00:04:27.360 --> 00:04:29.659 
a lot 75 there's no point talking
about<00:04:27.569> it<00:04:27.719> so<00:04:28.710> these<00:04:28.830> are<00:04:29.009> all<00:04:29.099> increases<00:04:29.550> on

00:04:29.659 --> 00:04:29.669 
about it so these are all increases on

00:04:29.669 --> 00:04:31.640 
about it so these are all increases on
the<00:04:29.699> base<00:04:29.879> values<00:04:30.270> from<00:04:30.389> the<00:04:30.509> last<00:04:30.689> table<00:04:30.840> with

00:04:34.459 --> 00:04:34.469 
brackets and as you can see with the

00:04:34.469 --> 00:04:35.839 
brackets and as you can see with the
quad<00:04:34.620> loop<00:04:34.770> potential<00:04:35.159> with<00:04:35.580> the<00:04:35.639> gloves

pick<00:04:37.979> potting<00:04:38.189> Master<00:04:38.400> farmers<00:04:38.759> now<00:04:38.969> this<00:04:39.120> is

00:04:39.200 --> 00:04:39.210 
pick potting Master farmers now this is

00:04:39.210 --> 00:04:40.189 
pick potting Master farmers now this is
considerably<00:04:39.689> better<00:04:39.750> than<00:04:39.960> what<00:04:40.139> you

00:04:40.189 --> 00:04:40.199 
considerably better than what you

00:04:40.199 --> 00:04:41.379 
considerably better than what you
could've<00:04:40.379> been<00:04:40.439> getting<00:04:40.530> with<00:04:40.710> one<00:04:40.770> ideality

00:04:41.379 --> 00:04:41.389 
could've been getting with one ideality

00:04:41.389 --> 00:04:43.999 
could've been getting with one ideality
and<00:04:42.389> so<00:04:43.229> the<00:04:43.319> very<00:04:43.469> last<00:04:43.500> figures<00:04:43.860> of<00:04:43.949> this

00:04:43.999 --> 00:04:44.009 
and so the very last figures of this

00:04:44.009 --> 00:04:46.249 
and so the very last figures of this
video<00:04:44.280> are<00:04:44.580> 99<00:04:45.030> agility<00:04:45.419> with<00:04:45.539> 99<00:04:45.900> thieving

00:04:46.249 --> 00:04:46.259 
video are 99 agility with 99 thieving

00:04:46.259 --> 00:04:47.839 
video are 99 agility with 99 thieving
again<00:04:47.069> you<00:04:47.219> can<00:04:47.310> see<00:04:47.430> for<00:04:47.550> yourself<00:04:47.789> the

00:04:47.839 --> 00:04:47.849 
again you can see for yourself the

00:04:47.849 --> 00:04:49.429 
again you can see for yourself the
massive<00:04:48.210> potential<00:04:48.780> that<00:04:49.050> there<00:04:49.169> is<00:04:49.289> here

00:04:49.429 --> 00:04:49.439 
massive potential that there is here

00:04:49.439 --> 00:04:51.110 
massive potential that there is here
making<00:04:49.740> money<00:04:49.919> I<00:04:50.129> mean<00:04:50.520> people<00:04:50.789> have<00:04:50.879> claimed

00:04:51.110 --> 00:04:51.120 
making money I mean people have claimed

00:04:51.120 --> 00:04:52.550 
making money I mean people have claimed
to<00:04:51.210> made<00:04:51.360> over<00:04:51.539> 1mill<00:04:51.840> an<00:04:51.960> hour<00:04:52.080> when<00:04:52.259> they<00:04:52.379> get

00:04:52.550 --> 00:04:52.560 
to made over 1mill an hour when they get

00:04:52.560 --> 00:04:54.770 
to made over 1mill an hour when they get
multiple<00:04:53.129> loot<00:04:53.250> of<00:04:53.460> total<00:04:53.969> seeds<00:04:54.150> for<00:04:54.360> example

00:04:54.770 --> 00:04:54.780 
multiple loot of total seeds for example

00:04:54.780 --> 00:04:56.270 
multiple loot of total seeds for example
now<00:04:55.050> it's<00:04:55.199> very<00:04:55.379> rare<00:04:55.590> but<00:04:55.770> it<00:04:55.860> is<00:04:55.979> entirely

00:04:56.270 --> 00:04:56.280 
now it's very rare but it is entirely

00:04:56.280 --> 00:04:58.939 
now it's very rare but it is entirely
possible<00:04:56.370> and<00:04:56.939> as<00:04:57.840> of<00:04:58.020> the<00:04:58.110> last<00:04:58.229> video<00:04:58.500> all<00:04:58.800> of

00:04:58.939 --> 00:04:58.949 
possible and as of the last video all of

00:04:58.949 --> 00:05:00.409 
possible and as of the last video all of
these<00:04:59.039> values<00:04:59.400> I've<00:04:59.610> stated<00:04:59.819> are<00:05:00.120> actually

00:05:00.409 --> 00:05:00.419 
these values I've stated are actually

00:05:00.419 --> 00:05:02.240 
these values I've stated are actually
averages<00:05:00.810> based<00:05:01.379> on<00:05:01.529> data<00:05:01.710> collected<00:05:01.949> by<00:05:02.129> me

00:05:02.240 --> 00:05:02.250 
averages based on data collected by me

00:05:02.250 --> 00:05:03.950 
averages based on data collected by me
and<00:05:02.340> my<00:05:02.460> friends<00:05:02.849> so<00:05:03.000> they<00:05:03.419> are<00:05:03.569> all<00:05:03.719> accurate

00:05:03.950 --> 00:05:03.960 
and my friends so they are all accurate

00:05:03.960 --> 00:05:05.300 
and my friends so they are all accurate
values<00:05:04.319> to<00:05:04.439> others<00:05:04.710> but<00:05:04.860> there<00:05:04.979> are<00:05:05.039> no<00:05:05.159> means

00:05:05.300 --> 00:05:05.310 
values to others but there are no means

00:05:05.310 --> 00:05:07.339 
values to others but there are no means
maximum<00:05:05.639> or<00:05:05.909> minimum<00:05:05.939> so<00:05:06.509> expect<00:05:07.169> to<00:05:07.259> get

00:05:07.339 --> 00:05:07.349 
maximum or minimum so expect to get

00:05:07.349 --> 00:05:08.600 
maximum or minimum so expect to get
above<00:05:07.560> and<00:05:07.710> below<00:05:07.889> these<00:05:08.039> values<00:05:08.310> if<00:05:08.430> you<00:05:08.460> do

00:05:08.600 --> 00:05:08.610 
above and below these values if you do

00:05:08.610 --> 00:05:10.429 
above and below these values if you do
it<00:05:08.669> yourself<00:05:08.900> all<00:05:09.900> right<00:05:10.139> then

00:05:10.429 --> 00:05:10.439 
it yourself all right then

00:05:10.439 --> 00:05:11.360 
it yourself all right then
I<00:05:10.469> hope<00:05:10.770> you've<00:05:10.919> learnt<00:05:11.129> another

00:05:11.360 --> 00:05:11.370 
I hope you've learnt another

00:05:11.370 --> 00:05:12.830 
I hope you've learnt another
money-making<00:05:11.639> method<00:05:12.090> today<00:05:12.300> and<00:05:12.509> that<00:05:12.810> you

00:05:12.830 --> 00:05:12.840
