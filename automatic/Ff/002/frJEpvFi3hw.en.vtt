00:03:02.849 --> 00:03:09.350 
in her case she was severely sound
supposed<00:03:03.849> to<00:03:03.940> make<00:03:04.060> the<00:03:04.150> wrong<00:03:04.269> choice<00:03:04.709> SDF

00:03:09.350 --> 00:03:09.360 

00:03:09.360 --> 00:03:11.940 

this<00:03:10.360> combined<00:03:10.959> with<00:03:11.049> the<00:03:11.200> fact<00:03:11.230> that<00:03:11.530> it<00:03:11.799> was

00:03:11.940 --> 00:03:11.950 
this combined with the fact that it was

00:03:11.950 --> 00:03:13.850 
this combined with the fact that it was
obvious<00:03:12.610> that<00:03:12.640> she<00:03:12.819> was<00:03:13.120> drinking<00:03:13.330> heavily

00:03:13.850 --> 00:03:13.860 
obvious that she was drinking heavily

00:03:13.860 --> 00:03:17.130 
obvious that she was drinking heavily
she<00:03:14.860> potentially<00:03:15.159> I<00:03:15.400> eat<00:03:15.640> stroke<00:03:15.940> and<00:03:16.510> she<00:03:17.049> was

00:03:17.130 --> 00:03:17.140 
she potentially I eat stroke and she was

00:03:17.140 --> 00:03:22.380 
she potentially I eat stroke and she was
drinking<00:03:17.349> and<00:03:18.159> so<00:03:18.370> she<00:03:18.430> lost<00:03:18.670> her<00:03:18.849> mind<00:03:18.970> yes

00:03:22.380 --> 00:03:22.390 

00:03:22.390 --> 00:03:38.670 

I<00:03:28.740> think<00:03:29.740> that<00:03:34.950> actually<00:03:36.480> an<00:03:37.480> energy<00:03:38.050> level<00:03:38.080> if

00:03:38.670 --> 00:03:38.680 
I think that actually an energy level if

00:03:38.680 --> 00:03:40.680 
I think that actually an energy level if
we<00:03:38.890> all<00:03:39.010> provide<00:03:39.370> our<00:03:39.610> voices<00:03:39.820> together<00:03:40.120> she

00:03:40.680 --> 00:03:40.690 
we all provide our voices together she

00:03:40.690 --> 00:03:48.270 
we all provide our voices together she
might<00:03:40.870> hear<00:03:46.770> next<00:03:47.770> time<00:03:47.890> she<00:03:48.010> goes<00:03:48.040> to<00:03:48.160> the

00:03:48.270 --> 00:03:48.280 
might hear next time she goes to the

00:03:48.280 --> 00:03:50.880 
might hear next time she goes to the
concert<00:03:48.700> and<00:03:49.300> she<00:03:49.480> does<00:03:49.630> a<00:03:49.660> lot<00:03:50.020> of<00:03:50.140> and<00:03:50.350> she

00:03:52.440 --> 00:03:52.450 
can maybe not sing along and given you

00:03:52.450 --> 00:03:53.670 
can maybe not sing along and given you
