the<00:01:10.420> professional<00:01:11.229> scene<00:01:11.440> like<00:01:11.619> LCS<00:01:12.100> as<00:01:12.400> his

00:01:12.840 --> 00:01:12.850 
the professional scene like LCS as his

00:01:12.850 --> 00:01:15.480 
the professional scene like LCS as his
kit<00:01:13.149> is<00:01:13.360> really<00:01:13.750> awesome<00:01:14.530> to<00:01:14.979> play<00:01:15.100> and<00:01:15.399> it's

00:01:15.480 --> 00:01:15.490 
kit is really awesome to play and it's

00:01:15.490 --> 00:01:17.490 
kit is really awesome to play and it's
really<00:01:15.729> nice<00:01:15.910> to<00:01:15.940> look<00:01:16.180> at<00:01:16.360> his<00:01:17.290> kill

00:01:17.490 --> 00:01:17.500 
really nice to look at his kill

00:01:17.500 --> 00:01:19.080 
really nice to look at his kill
potential<00:01:17.979> in<00:01:18.070> the<00:01:18.130> lanes<00:01:18.369> really<00:01:18.670> high<00:01:18.820> he

00:01:19.080 --> 00:01:19.090 
potential in the lanes really high he

00:01:19.090 --> 00:01:21.660 
potential in the lanes really high he
can<00:01:19.240> deny<00:01:19.420> in<00:01:19.780> all<00:01:19.899> this<00:01:20.220> but<00:01:21.220> the<00:01:21.310> reason<00:01:21.640> he

00:01:21.660 --> 00:01:21.670 
can deny in all this but the reason he

00:01:21.670 --> 00:01:23.969 
can deny in all this but the reason he
hasn't<00:01:21.850> played<00:01:22.060> in<00:01:22.750> that<00:01:23.080> type<00:01:23.320> of<00:01:23.350> level<00:01:23.649> is

00:01:23.969 --> 00:01:23.979 
hasn't played in that type of level is

00:01:23.979 --> 00:01:25.920 
hasn't played in that type of level is
because<00:01:24.399> every<00:01:24.850> single<00:01:25.270> one<00:01:25.360> of<00:01:25.509> his<00:01:25.630> spells

00:01:25.920 --> 00:01:25.930 
because every single one of his spells

00:01:25.930 --> 00:01:29.040 
because every single one of his spells
is<00:01:26.110> a<00:01:26.140> skill<00:01:26.470> shot<00:01:26.740> of<00:01:27.580> a<00:01:27.880> high<00:01:28.090> accuracy<00:01:28.660> you

00:01:29.040 --> 00:01:29.050 
is a skill shot of a high accuracy you

00:01:29.050 --> 00:01:30.600 
is a skill shot of a high accuracy you
need<00:01:29.290> to<00:01:29.470> hit<00:01:29.649> every<00:01:29.979> single<00:01:30.009> one<00:01:30.340> of<00:01:30.399> them<00:01:30.580> for

00:01:30.600 --> 00:01:30.610 
need to hit every single one of them for

00:01:30.610 --> 00:01:32.940 
need to hit every single one of them for
him<00:01:30.820> to<00:01:30.940> be<00:01:31.030> effective<00:01:31.479> especially<00:01:31.780> as<00:01:32.530> alt<00:01:32.740> in

him to be effective especially as alt in

00:01:32.950 --> 00:01:35.310 
him to be effective especially as alt in
the<00:01:33.340> teamfight<00:01:33.580> if<00:01:33.910> you<00:01:34.030> misses<00:01:34.330> alt<00:01:34.600> which

00:01:35.310 --> 00:01:35.320 
the teamfight if you misses alt which

the teamfight if you misses alt which

00:01:37.050 --> 00:01:37.060 
takes a while to actually hit then

00:01:37.060 --> 00:01:39.210 
takes a while to actually hit then
you're<00:01:37.810> missing<00:01:38.110> a<00:01:38.200> huge<00:01:38.649> chunk<00:01:38.920> of<00:01:39.069> your

00:01:39.210 --> 00:01:39.220 
you're missing a huge chunk of your

00:01:39.220 --> 00:01:42.870 
you're missing a huge chunk of your
damage<00:01:39.580> and<00:01:39.759> it's<00:01:40.600> too<00:01:40.869> unreliable<00:01:41.880> for

00:01:42.870 --> 00:01:42.880 
damage and it's too unreliable for

00:01:42.880 --> 00:01:45.210 
damage and it's too unreliable for
professionals<00:01:43.450> like<00:01:43.810> teams<00:01:44.319> like<00:01:44.530> EG<00:01:45.009> or

00:01:45.210 --> 00:01:45.220 
professionals like teams like EG or

00:01:45.220 --> 00:01:46.650 
professionals like teams like EG or
gambit<00:01:45.729> that<00:01:45.850> sort<00:01:46.030> of<00:01:46.060> thing<00:01:46.270> that's<00:01:46.420> why<00:01:46.600> you

00:01:46.650 --> 00:01:46.660 
gambit that sort of thing that's why you

00:01:46.660 --> 00:01:49.320 
gambit that sort of thing that's why you
see<00:01:46.959> Lux<00:01:47.350> more<00:01:47.950> so<00:01:48.340> the<00:01:48.490> zigs<00:01:48.729> because<00:01:49.119> Lux

00:01:49.320 --> 00:01:49.330 
see Lux more so the zigs because Lux

00:01:49.330 --> 00:01:50.969 
see Lux more so the zigs because Lux
pretty<00:01:49.600> much<00:01:49.750> offers<00:01:49.959> the<00:01:50.319> exact<00:01:50.590> same<00:01:50.800> as

00:01:50.969 --> 00:01:50.979 
pretty much offers the exact same as

00:01:50.979 --> 00:01:53.910 
pretty much offers the exact same as
zigs<00:01:51.280> but<00:01:52.149> in<00:01:52.780> a<00:01:52.899> normal<00:01:53.200> game<00:01:53.229> I<00:01:53.410> just<00:01:53.770> love

00:01:53.910 --> 00:01:53.920 
zigs but in a normal game I just love

00:01:53.920 --> 00:01:55.350 
zigs but in a normal game I just love
playing<00:01:54.069> the<00:01:54.369> little<00:01:54.459> wrap<00:01:54.789> that<00:01:55.000> can<00:01:55.119> just

00:01:55.350 --> 00:01:55.360 
playing the little wrap that can just

00:01:55.360 --> 00:02:03.110 
playing the little wrap that can just
jump<00:01:55.569> around

00:02:03.110 --> 00:02:03.120 

00:02:03.120 --> 00:02:05.550
