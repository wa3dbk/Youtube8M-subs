00:00:06.170 --> 00:00:06.180 
part of emergency preparation that's why

00:00:06.180 --> 00:00:07.519 
part of emergency preparation that's why
you<00:00:06.240> go<00:00:06.359> through<00:00:06.569> a<00:00:06.629> safety<00:00:06.899> briefing<00:00:07.170> every

00:00:11.660 --> 00:00:11.670 
time you fly more realistic the training

00:00:11.670 --> 00:00:13.190 
time you fly more realistic the training
can<00:00:11.820> be<00:00:12.030> the<00:00:12.480> better<00:00:12.630> the<00:00:12.840> level<00:00:13.110> of

conduct realistic training for SFO the

00:00:30.869 --> 00:00:32.600 
conduct realistic training for SFO the
solution<00:00:31.349> was<00:00:31.500> to<00:00:31.529> buy<00:00:31.859> their<00:00:32.130> very<00:00:32.460> own

00:00:32.600 --> 00:00:32.610

00:01:06.820 --> 00:01:08.940 
for four years I was involved in the
process<00:01:07.240> but<00:01:07.420> it<00:01:07.540> was<00:01:07.660> really<00:01:07.930> a<00:01:07.960> team<00:01:08.440> effort

00:01:08.940 --> 00:01:08.950

00:01:13.170 --> 00:01:13.180 
up old for us and we made some

00:01:13.180 --> 00:01:15.810 
up old for us and we made some
assessments<00:01:13.810> and<00:01:13.990> ultimately<00:01:14.920> decided<00:01:15.550> to<00:01:15.670> go

00:01:15.810 --> 00:01:15.820 
assessments and ultimately decided to go

00:01:15.820 --> 00:01:19.920 
assessments and ultimately decided to go
with<00:01:16.030> the<00:01:16.240> aircraft<00:01:16.960> that<00:01:17.170> we<00:01:17.320> have<00:01:18.930> after

chief Dale Karns to find out more about
how<00:01:43.930> the<00:01:43.990> aircraft<00:01:44.229> can<00:01:44.680> benefit<00:01:45.009> his<00:01:45.220> group

00:01:45.859 --> 00:01:45.869 
how the aircraft can benefit his group

00:01:45.869 --> 00:01:49.050 
how the aircraft can benefit his group
so<00:01:46.869> having<00:01:47.080> this<00:01:47.259> aircraft<00:01:47.680> is<00:01:47.800> a<00:01:47.890> huge<00:01:48.280> huge

00:01:49.050 --> 00:01:49.060 
so having this aircraft is a huge huge

00:01:49.060 --> 00:01:51.590 
so having this aircraft is a huge huge
advantage<00:01:49.210> for<00:01:49.570> us<00:01:49.780> because<00:01:50.130> whether<00:01:51.130> it's

00:01:51.590 --> 00:01:51.600 
advantage for us because whether it's

00:01:51.600 --> 00:01:54.270 
advantage for us because whether it's
the<00:01:52.600> staging<00:01:53.050> of<00:01:53.170> our<00:01:53.290> equipment<00:01:53.560> and

ability<00:02:10.090> develop<00:02:10.810> scenarios<00:02:11.170> for<00:02:11.680> our

00:02:11.790 --> 00:02:11.800 
ability develop scenarios for our

00:02:11.800 --> 00:02:13.710 
ability develop scenarios for our
training<00:02:12.250> and<00:02:12.370> our<00:02:12.490> and<00:02:12.760> our<00:02:12.850> drills<00:02:13.090> adding

00:02:13.710 --> 00:02:13.720 
training and our and our drills adding

00:02:13.720 --> 00:02:15.570 
training and our and our drills adding
to<00:02:13.900> the<00:02:14.020> realism<00:02:14.380> increasing<00:02:15.010> that<00:02:15.160> quality

00:02:15.570 --> 00:02:15.580 
to the realism increasing that quality

00:02:15.580 --> 00:02:18.720 
to the realism increasing that quality
of<00:02:15.610> training<00:02:15.970> for<00:02:16.090> us<00:02:16.120> exponentially<00:02:17.610> so<00:02:18.610> when

00:02:18.720 --> 00:02:18.730 
of training for us exponentially so when

00:02:18.730 --> 00:02:19.650 
of training for us exponentially so when
it<00:02:18.819> comes<00:02:19.030> to<00:02:19.180> training

00:02:19.650 --> 00:02:19.660 
it comes to training

00:02:19.660 --> 00:02:22.110 
it comes to training
this<00:02:19.959> aircraft<00:02:20.200> gives<00:02:20.620> SFO<00:02:21.160> a<00:02:21.190> realistic<00:02:21.970> way

00:02:22.110 --> 00:02:22.120 
this aircraft gives SFO a realistic way

00:02:22.120 --> 00:02:23.090 
this aircraft gives SFO a realistic way
to<00:02:22.180> stay<00:02:22.510> prepared

00:02:23.090 --> 00:02:23.100 
to stay prepared

00:02:23.100 --> 00:02:25.230 
to stay prepared
it's<00:02:24.100> a<00:02:24.250> purchase<00:02:24.640> that<00:02:24.760> we're<00:02:24.910> very<00:02:24.940> very

proud<00:02:25.480> of<00:02:25.600> and<00:02:26.050> that<00:02:26.260> aircraft<00:02:26.410> will<00:02:26.770> probably

00:02:27.059 --> 00:02:27.069 
proud of and that aircraft will probably

00:02:27.069 --> 00:02:30.410 
proud of and that aircraft will probably
be<00:02:27.190> here<00:02:27.400> for<00:02:27.640> many<00:02:27.910> many<00:02:28.180> years<00:02:28.270> to<00:02:28.569> come

00:02:30.410 --> 00:02:30.420 
be here for many many years to come

00:02:30.420 --> 00:02:32.670 
be here for many many years to come
