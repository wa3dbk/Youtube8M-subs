00:00:48.790 --> 00:00:52.080
 we can also Kurt Beck SPD - two completely free 

00:00:53.390 --> 00:00:55.100
 to timely when needed 

00:00:55.100 --> 00:00:58.460
 in a simplified form of 30 

00:00:58.460 --> 00:01:00.260
 so ran it again 

00:01:00.260 --> 00:01:03.350
 so I give you completely normal 

00:01:03.350 --> 00:01:05.680
 can display on the pages 

00:01:05.680 --> 00:01:08.680
 So danger 

00:01:10.080 --> 00:01:11.860
 CANopen 

00:01:11.860 --> 00:01:14.860
 and now 

00:01:18.590 --> 00:01:22.050
 as a passenger he follows on Ross Brawn 

00:01:22.050 --> 00:01:24.170
 Klotz sometimes 

00:01:24.170 --> 00:01:25.670
 Bender 

00:01:25.670 --> 00:01:28.670
 come now 

00:01:31.260 --> 00:01:36.250
 one was in 

00:01:38.790 --> 00:01:42.010
 suddenly handle 

00:01:42.010 --> 00:01:46.620
 two fingers what was her index finger and Anja w Gettelfinger 

00:01:46.620 --> 00:01:49.230
 that means to play the ride with the middle finger 

00:01:49.230 --> 00:01:53.160
 on the top side the the ca RWE should be in the third and 

00:01:54.540 --> 00:01:57.350
 No, you beat 

00:01:57.350 --> 00:02:00.350
 The second side has two advantages it should 

00:02:05.530 --> 00:02:06.550
 then percent 

00:02:06.550 --> 00:02:07.390
 the no 

00:02:07.390 --> 00:02:10.390
 two fingers shown on the second page 

00:02:12.759 --> 00:02:15.759
 again on the opposite side at the top 

00:02:16.759 --> 00:02:18.279
 with a star de 

00:02:18.279 --> 00:02:21.279
 Vettel drives down one side 

00:02:21.959 --> 00:02:23.839
 Juliane Zeilinger 

00:02:23.839 --> 00:02:26.220
 seen on the third page EUR 

00:02:26.220 --> 00:02:28.609
 became second 

00:02:28.609 --> 00:02:31.609
 he was empty, he says 

00:02:39.819 --> 00:02:42.819
 unable to continue 

00:02:44.939 --> 00:02:47.529
 to breathe 

00:02:47.529 --> 00:02:50.469
 the lecturers Newell 

00:02:50.469 --> 00:02:53.929
 now it is important so far it is easy 

00:02:53.929 --> 00:02:58.319
 So sorry, sorry, I'll tell you all now 

00:02:58.319 --> 00:03:01.839
 slow as this one must play so excited he says already broken 

00:03:01.839 --> 00:03:03.059
 the index finger 

00:03:03.059 --> 00:03:06.059
 and the middle finger all the other fingers basically disappear 

00:03:07.079 --> 00:03:09.389
 like playing only in two cases 

00:03:09.389 --> 00:03:12.389
 we play in the second fret and like spiders in the third word 

00:03:13.269 --> 00:03:16.689
 we start with the middle finger on the top ticking it said 

00:03:17.539 --> 00:03:20.539
 hit once 

00:03:27.099 --> 00:03:28.659
 very simple 

00:03:28.659 --> 00:03:32.920
 hit once then hit the flip side once on the second 

00:03:32.919 --> 00:03:35.419
 page 

00:03:35.419 --> 00:03:38.419
 Dornheim Mainseite just grab more stuff 

00:03:43.489 --> 00:03:46.489
 normal for us 

00:03:48.249 --> 00:03:51.499
 Dante's index finger in the second fret on the second page 

00:03:54.009 --> 00:03:57.009
 from the beginning again 

00:03:57.739 --> 00:04:01.049
 Bohemian 

00:04:01.049 --> 00:04:04.459
 then again he had to meet because of this 

00:04:04.459 --> 00:04:07.219
 in the third fret 

00:04:07.219 --> 00:04:09.649
 I already hear a finger on the 

00:04:09.649 --> 00:04:12.649
 further below, Andreas Brohme 

00:04:13.279 --> 00:04:15.499
 Norman Hunter 

00:04:15.499 --> 00:04:18.529
 then again the index fingers second fret 

00:04:18.529 --> 00:04:21.529
 he hopes authorities page m 

00:04:22.279 --> 00:04:25.279
 So let yourself be so can the dogs so Schlatt on the edge 

00:04:25.860 --> 00:04:28.960
 then empty no 

00:04:28.960 --> 00:04:32.120
 da Rocha back up one page 

00:04:32.120 --> 00:04:35.120
 and then comes the midfielder 

00:04:35.949 --> 00:04:37.150
 the controller 

00:04:37.150 --> 00:04:38.360
 clarify 

00:04:38.360 --> 00:04:41.759
 two left side third is supposed to be single 

00:04:41.759 --> 00:04:44.749
 thanks second reason second page 

00:04:44.749 --> 00:04:47.749
 a third party third should talk to the second page 

00:04:48.400 --> 00:04:51.400
 Nia second fret side seen from above 

00:04:52.289 --> 00:04:54.469
 Dr newspaper 

00:04:54.469 --> 00:04:57.799
 and finally who the Rose de Zeiter was in the third 

00:05:00.199 --> 00:05:04.710
 the hits so only once each page on each page he does not need 

00:05:04.710 --> 00:05:08.620
 great home taste there is no big park chan the n 

00:05:08.620 --> 00:05:10.819
 rather it has to be easy 

00:05:10.819 --> 00:05:12.710
 so normal for us 

00:05:12.710 --> 00:05:15.710
 with a so-called 

00:05:31.009 --> 00:05:35.620
 Just play it for Sam's at the beginning of May to play the camp afterwards 

00:05:35.620 --> 00:05:38.379
 you notice the order here much better 

00:05:38.379 --> 00:05:41.379
 maybe it can also lubricate 

00:05:48.729 --> 00:05:51.729
 the collective order 

00:06:03.099 --> 00:06:06.569
 so in this crisis, the CIO is next for the refrain with whole milk 

00:06:06.569 --> 00:06:06.870
 Summer is running
