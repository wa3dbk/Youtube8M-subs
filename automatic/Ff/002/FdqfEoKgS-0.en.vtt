jazz<00:03:03.180> when<00:03:03.389> I<00:03:03.420> was<00:03:03.600> younger<00:03:03.930> and<00:03:04.019> in<00:03:04.139> high

00:03:04.309 --> 00:03:04.319 
jazz when I was younger and in high

00:03:04.319 --> 00:03:05.840 
jazz when I was younger and in high
school<00:03:04.620> in<00:03:04.769> middle<00:03:05.010> school<00:03:05.220> so<00:03:05.250> I<00:03:05.430> use<00:03:05.639> this<00:03:05.790> to

00:03:05.840 --> 00:03:05.850 
school in middle school so I use this to

00:03:05.850 --> 00:03:08.059 
school in middle school so I use this to
help<00:03:06.150> lighten<00:03:06.420> that<00:03:06.660> up<00:03:06.720> and<00:03:07.109> it<00:03:07.920> also

00:03:08.059 --> 00:03:08.069 
help lighten that up and it also

00:03:08.069 --> 00:03:10.069 
help lighten that up and it also
moisturizes<00:03:08.340> as<00:03:08.970> well<00:03:09.180> so<00:03:09.389> I<00:03:09.450> really<00:03:09.750> like<00:03:09.930> how

00:03:10.069 --> 00:03:10.079 
moisturizes as well so I really like how

00:03:10.079 --> 00:03:12.110 
moisturizes as well so I really like how
those<00:03:10.260> two<00:03:10.560> are<00:03:11.519> kind<00:03:11.790> of<00:03:11.819> like<00:03:11.970> combining

00:03:12.110 --> 00:03:12.120 
those two are kind of like combining

00:03:12.120 --> 00:03:14.780 
those two are kind of like combining
factors<00:03:12.840> so<00:03:13.349> it<00:03:13.620> does<00:03:13.799> actually<00:03:14.310> really<00:03:14.579> work

00:03:14.780 --> 00:03:14.790 
factors so it does actually really work

00:03:14.790 --> 00:03:16.129 
factors so it does actually really work
you<00:03:14.940> just<00:03:14.970> have<00:03:15.269> to<00:03:15.389> wait<00:03:15.569> awhile<00:03:15.690> to<00:03:15.959> see

00:03:16.129 --> 00:03:16.139 
you just have to wait awhile to see

00:03:16.139 --> 00:03:18.379
