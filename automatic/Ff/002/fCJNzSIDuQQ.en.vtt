so<00:04:07.940> using<00:04:08.270> a<00:04:08.360> scary<00:04:08.690> isn't<00:04:08.960> going<00:04:09.170> to<00:04:09.230> make

00:04:09.370 --> 00:04:09.380 
so using a scary isn't going to make

00:04:09.380 --> 00:04:11.980 
so using a scary isn't going to make
them<00:04:09.560> any<00:04:09.800> worse<00:04:10.100> now<00:04:10.910> the<00:04:10.970> bike<00:04:11.240> is<00:04:11.510> covered
