00:02:12.050 --> 00:02:12.060 
risk today to be fast but I was also at

00:02:12.060 --> 00:02:14.840 
risk today to be fast but I was also at
a<00:02:12.090> lot<00:02:12.510> of<00:02:12.660> luck<00:02:12.840> today<00:02:12.990> a<00:02:13.860> few<00:02:14.459> riders<00:02:14.640> were

00:02:14.840 --> 00:02:14.850

a lot of luck today a few riders were
faster<00:02:15.270> and<00:02:15.360> at<00:02:15.450> one<00:02:15.630> down<00:02:15.840> and<00:02:16.260> like<00:02:17.040> Scott

00:02:17.390 --> 00:02:17.400 
faster and at one down and like Scott

00:02:17.400 --> 00:02:21.020

years<00:02:17.730> was<00:02:18.450> really<00:02:18.990> almost<00:02:19.380> nothing<00:02:20.030> slower

00:02:21.020 --> 00:02:21.030 
years was really almost nothing slower

00:02:21.030 --> 00:02:23.480 
years was really almost nothing slower
so<00:02:21.420> I<00:02:22.080> think<00:02:22.380> that<00:02:22.709> was<00:02:22.860> the<00:02:22.890> point<00:02:23.160> today<00:02:23.340> and

00:02:23.480 --> 00:02:23.490 
so I think that was the point today and

00:02:23.490 --> 00:02:25.910 
so I think that was the point today and
I'm<00:02:23.970> the<00:02:24.090> lucky<00:02:24.330> one<00:02:24.360> today<00:02:24.570> Scott<00:02:25.380> brash<00:02:25.680> for
