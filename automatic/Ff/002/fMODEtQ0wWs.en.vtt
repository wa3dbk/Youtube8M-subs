00:00:28.880 --> 00:00:28.890 
works so it's a multiplayer tactical

00:00:28.890 --> 00:00:31.910 
works so it's a multiplayer tactical
game<00:00:29.070> basically<00:00:29.519> and<00:00:30.410> instead<00:00:31.410> of<00:00:31.529> taking

00:00:31.910 --> 00:00:31.920 
game basically and instead of taking

00:00:31.920 --> 00:00:34.819 
game basically and instead of taking
turns<00:00:32.279> one<00:00:32.640> off<00:00:32.820> the<00:00:33.059> other<00:00:33.380> which<00:00:34.380> you<00:00:34.530> see<00:00:34.739> in

00:00:34.819 --> 00:00:34.829 
turns one off the other which you see in

00:00:34.829 --> 00:00:37.370 
turns one off the other which you see in
normal<00:00:35.130> things<00:00:35.370> like<00:00:35.489> XCOM<00:00:36.090> to<00:00:36.719> both<00:00:37.020> players

00:00:37.370 --> 00:00:37.380 
normal things like XCOM to both players

00:00:37.380 --> 00:00:39.979 
normal things like XCOM to both players
take<00:00:37.770> the<00:00:37.829> turns<00:00:38.190> at<00:00:38.340> the<00:00:38.399> same<00:00:38.579> time<00:00:38.879> and<00:00:39.180> then

00:00:39.979 --> 00:00:39.989 
take the turns at the same time and then

00:00:39.989 --> 00:00:42.889 
take the turns at the same time and then
the<00:00:40.440> results<00:00:41.129> are<00:00:41.219> played<00:00:41.430> out<00:00:41.460> together<00:00:41.899> so

00:00:42.889 --> 00:00:42.899 
the results are played out together so

00:00:42.899 --> 00:00:45.770 
the results are played out together so
in<00:00:43.710> sort<00:00:44.489> of<00:00:44.550> normal<00:00:44.879> term<00:00:45.030> based<00:00:45.210> games<00:00:45.480> I

00:00:45.770 --> 00:00:45.780 
in sort of normal term based games I

00:00:45.780 --> 00:00:50.330 
in sort of normal term based games I
might<00:00:46.200> move<00:00:46.410> my<00:00:46.710> guy<00:00:46.950> here<00:00:47.940> and<00:00:49.010> then<00:00:50.010> my

00:00:50.330 --> 00:00:50.340 
might move my guy here and then my

00:00:50.340 --> 00:00:54.439 
might move my guy here and then my
opponent<00:00:50.820> might<00:00:51.710> move<00:00:52.710> himself<00:00:53.120> here<00:00:54.120> and

00:00:54.439 --> 00:00:54.449 
opponent might move himself here and

00:00:54.449 --> 00:00:56.800 
opponent might move himself here and
then

00:00:56.800 --> 00:00:56.810 
then

00:00:56.810 --> 00:00:59.200 
then
I<00:00:56.870> like<00:00:57.650> move<00:00:57.800> myself<00:00:57.950> over<00:00:58.580> here<00:00:58.610> so<00:00:58.970> that's<00:00:59.120> a

00:00:59.200 --> 00:00:59.210 
I like move myself over here so that's a

00:00:59.210 --> 00:01:01.900 
I like move myself over here so that's a
normal<00:00:59.300> turn-based<00:00:59.690> game<00:00:59.900> but<00:01:00.500> in<00:01:00.740> a<00:01:00.980> cylinder

00:01:01.900 --> 00:01:01.910 
normal turn-based game but in a cylinder

00:01:01.910 --> 00:01:03.850 
normal turn-based game but in a cylinder
turn-based<00:01:02.210> game<00:01:02.450> like<00:01:02.810> this<00:01:02.990> most<00:01:03.710> people

00:01:03.850 --> 00:01:03.860 
turn-based game like this most people

00:01:03.860 --> 00:01:07.180 
turn-based game like this most people
make<00:01:04.220> their<00:01:04.370> plans<00:01:04.489> at<00:01:04.790> the<00:01:04.880> same<00:01:05.030> time<00:01:06.190> not

00:01:07.180 --> 00:01:07.190 
make their plans at the same time not

00:01:07.190 --> 00:01:08.350 
make their plans at the same time not
having<00:01:07.250> the<00:01:07.550> sois<00:01:07.730> idea<00:01:08.060> what<00:01:08.180> the<00:01:08.270> other

00:01:08.350 --> 00:01:08.360 
having the sois idea what the other

00:01:08.360 --> 00:01:10.750 
having the sois idea what the other
person<00:01:08.600> is<00:01:08.660> doing<00:01:08.780> and<00:01:09.170> then<00:01:09.590> he<00:01:10.040> was<00:01:10.220> ups<00:01:10.580> or

00:01:10.750 --> 00:01:10.760 
person is doing and then he was ups or

00:01:10.760 --> 00:01:14.050 
person is doing and then he was ups or
executed<00:01:11.330> together<00:01:12.430> and<00:01:13.430> then<00:01:13.640> it<00:01:13.790> goes<00:01:13.910> on

00:01:14.050 --> 00:01:14.060 
executed together and then it goes on

00:01:14.060 --> 00:01:14.950 
executed together and then it goes on
and<00:01:14.180> on<00:01:14.270> and<00:01:14.390> on<00:01:14.480> so<00:01:14.690> that's<00:01:14.750> what<00:01:14.930> a

00:01:14.950 --> 00:01:14.960 
and on and on so that's what a

00:01:14.960 --> 00:01:17.920 
and on and on so that's what a
simultaneous<00:01:15.260> turn-based<00:01:15.830> game<00:01:16.070> is<00:01:16.930> frozen

00:01:17.920 --> 00:01:17.930 
simultaneous turn-based game is frozen

00:01:17.930 --> 00:01:20.590 
simultaneous turn-based game is frozen
synapse<00:01:18.230> is<00:01:19.010> meant<00:01:19.460> to<00:01:19.670> be<00:01:19.700> a<00:01:19.820> game<00:01:20.150> where

00:01:20.590 --> 00:01:20.600 
synapse is meant to be a game where

00:01:20.600 --> 00:01:22.630 
synapse is meant to be a game where
almost<00:01:21.080> every<00:01:21.650> turn<00:01:21.860> is<00:01:22.010> meaningful<00:01:22.520> it

00:01:22.630 --> 00:01:22.640 
almost every turn is meaningful it

00:01:22.640 --> 00:01:24.730 
almost every turn is meaningful it
really<00:01:22.880> frustrates<00:01:23.030> me<00:01:23.600> in<00:01:23.690> games<00:01:23.960> where<00:01:24.230> most

00:01:24.730 --> 00:01:24.740 
really frustrates me in games where most

00:01:24.740 --> 00:01:27.040 
really frustrates me in games where most
of<00:01:24.860> the<00:01:24.920> time<00:01:25.280> you're<00:01:25.640> just<00:01:25.670> sort<00:01:26.090> of<00:01:26.120> doing

00:01:27.040 --> 00:01:27.050 
of the time you're just sort of doing

00:01:27.050 --> 00:01:29.680 
of the time you're just sort of doing
the<00:01:27.260> rope<00:01:27.470> things<00:01:27.830> and<00:01:28.190> the<00:01:28.940> person<00:01:29.300> who<00:01:29.330> wins

00:01:29.680 --> 00:01:29.690 
the rope things and the person who wins

00:01:29.690 --> 00:01:31.510 
the rope things and the person who wins
is<00:01:30.020> often<00:01:30.320> won<00:01:30.500> the<00:01:30.650> first<00:01:30.860> couple<00:01:31.070> of<00:01:31.250> turns

00:01:31.510 --> 00:01:31.520 
is often won the first couple of turns

00:01:31.520 --> 00:01:34.210 
is often won the first couple of turns
or<00:01:31.940> one<00:01:32.150> wins<00:01:32.420> in<00:01:32.600> the<00:01:32.660> last<00:01:32.690> turn<00:01:33.200> and<00:01:33.380> what<00:01:34.190> I

00:01:34.210 --> 00:01:34.220 
or one wins in the last turn and what I

00:01:34.220 --> 00:01:35.830 
or one wins in the last turn and what I
really<00:01:34.520> wanted<00:01:34.760> is<00:01:34.910> for<00:01:35.060> every<00:01:35.360> single<00:01:35.600> turn

00:01:35.830 --> 00:01:35.840 
really wanted is for every single turn

00:01:35.840 --> 00:01:37.690 
really wanted is for every single turn
to<00:01:36.020> be<00:01:36.140> fun<00:01:36.440> and<00:01:36.680> for<00:01:36.979> the<00:01:37.040> person<00:01:37.369> who's<00:01:37.520> the

00:01:37.690 --> 00:01:37.700 
to be fun and for the person who's the

00:01:37.700 --> 00:01:39.670 
to be fun and for the person who's the
best<00:01:37.910> tactics<00:01:38.330> in<00:01:38.450> any<00:01:38.570> turn<00:01:38.810> even<00:01:39.410> if<00:01:39.500> they've

00:01:39.670 --> 00:01:39.680 
best tactics in any turn even if they've

00:01:39.680 --> 00:01:41.740 
best tactics in any turn even if they've
got<00:01:39.890> like<00:01:40.070> a<00:01:40.100> numerical<00:01:40.700> disadvantage<00:01:40.970> can

00:01:41.740 --> 00:01:41.750 
got like a numerical disadvantage can

00:01:41.750 --> 00:01:44.050 
got like a numerical disadvantage can
win<00:01:42.070> so<00:01:43.070> I'm<00:01:43.130> going<00:01:43.280> to<00:01:43.460> talk<00:01:43.760> to<00:01:43.820> you<00:01:43.970> about

00:01:46.510 --> 00:01:46.520 
the rules now that clear that was very

close combat in ruined cities with
machine<00:02:13.940> guns<00:02:14.120> basically<00:02:14.600> so<00:02:15.430> we<00:02:16.430> don't<00:02:16.670> have

00:02:16.809 --> 00:02:16.819 
machine guns basically so we don't have

00:02:16.819 --> 00:02:18.280 
machine guns basically so we don't have
health<00:02:17.060> bar<00:02:17.330> is<00:02:17.480> the<00:02:17.510> first<00:02:17.780> deployed<00:02:18.050> a<00:02:18.080> thing

00:02:18.280 --> 00:02:18.290 
health bar is the first deployed a thing

about<00:02:18.410> frozen<00:02:18.830> design<00:02:19.100> apps<00:02:19.280> because<00:02:19.550> I<00:02:20.770> find

00:02:21.760 --> 00:02:21.770 
about frozen design apps because I find

00:02:21.770 --> 00:02:25.360 
about frozen design apps because I find
help<00:02:21.980> ask<00:02:22.160> my<00:02:22.370> point<00:02:22.610> then<00:02:23.000> so<00:02:23.770> in<00:02:24.770> this<00:02:25.069> game

00:02:25.360 --> 00:02:25.370 
help ask my point then so in this game

00:02:25.370 --> 00:02:28.780 
help ask my point then so in this game
one<00:02:25.880> shot<00:02:26.300> kills<00:02:27.290> one<00:02:27.710> accurate<00:02:28.100> shot<00:02:28.310> kill<00:02:28.520> so

00:02:28.780 --> 00:02:28.790 
one shot kills one accurate shot kill so

00:02:28.790 --> 00:02:30.850 
one shot kills one accurate shot kill so
I'm<00:02:28.910> figuring<00:02:29.120> I'd<00:02:29.450> ever<00:02:29.720> kill<00:02:29.960> if<00:02:30.530> we<00:02:30.680> get

00:02:30.850 --> 00:02:30.860 
I'm figuring I'd ever kill if we get

00:02:30.860 --> 00:02:33.190 
I'm figuring I'd ever kill if we get
some<00:02:31.220> the<00:02:32.180> bad<00:02:32.360> guy<00:02:32.540> to<00:02:32.600> look<00:02:32.870> in<00:02:33.020> the<00:02:33.080> wrong

00:02:33.190 --> 00:02:33.200 
some the bad guy to look in the wrong

00:02:33.200 --> 00:02:34.510 
some the bad guy to look in the wrong
direction<00:02:33.319> over<00:02:33.650> here<00:02:33.860> and<00:02:34.040> we're<00:02:34.310> going<00:02:34.460> to

00:02:34.510 --> 00:02:34.520 
direction over here and we're going to

00:02:34.520 --> 00:02:35.559 
direction over here and we're going to
come<00:02:34.700> out<00:02:34.730> through<00:02:35.060> and<00:02:35.180> we're<00:02:35.270> going<00:02:35.390> to<00:02:35.420> look

00:02:35.559 --> 00:02:35.569 
come out through and we're going to look

00:02:35.569 --> 00:02:39.910 
come out through and we're going to look
this<00:02:35.750> window<00:02:36.050> we're<00:02:36.200> gonna<00:02:36.319> shoot

00:02:39.910 --> 00:02:39.920 

00:02:39.920 --> 00:02:45.940 

I<00:02:39.980> need<00:02:40.790> that<00:02:41.290> so<00:02:43.540> the<00:02:44.540> rules<00:02:44.930> are<00:02:45.230> basically

00:02:45.940 --> 00:02:45.950 
I need that so the rules are basically

00:02:45.950 --> 00:02:48.160 
I need that so the rules are basically
trying<00:02:46.459> to<00:02:46.580> be<00:02:46.670> a<00:02:46.700> similar<00:02:47.180> to<00:02:47.330> real<00:02:47.630> life<00:02:47.720> form

00:02:48.160 --> 00:02:48.170 
trying to be a similar to real life form

00:02:48.170 --> 00:02:50.320 
trying to be a similar to real life form
as<00:02:48.349> possible<00:02:48.800> so<00:02:49.040> in<00:02:49.160> fact<00:02:49.310> if<00:02:49.430> we<00:02:49.459> allow<00:02:50.270> the

00:02:50.320 --> 00:02:50.330 
as possible so in fact if we allow the

00:02:50.330 --> 00:02:51.910 
as possible so in fact if we allow the
enemy<00:02:50.510> to<00:02:50.630> look<00:02:50.870> in<00:02:50.989> the<00:02:51.080> right<00:02:51.170> direction<00:02:51.349> as

00:02:51.910 --> 00:02:51.920 
enemy to look in the right direction as

00:02:51.920 --> 00:02:54.100 
enemy to look in the right direction as
well<00:02:52.510> we're<00:02:53.510> still<00:02:53.750> going<00:02:53.870> to<00:02:53.959> win<00:02:54.080> because

00:02:54.100 --> 00:02:54.110 
well we're still going to win because

00:02:54.110 --> 00:02:55.809 
well we're still going to win because
we're<00:02:54.500> popping<00:02:54.860> up<00:02:54.980> behind<00:02:55.190> a<00:02:55.310> window<00:02:55.459> we're

00:02:55.809 --> 00:02:55.819 
we're popping up behind a window we're

00:02:55.819 --> 00:02:58.000 
we're popping up behind a window we're
behind<00:02:56.090> cover<00:02:56.480> and<00:02:56.870> he's<00:02:57.380> standing<00:02:57.650> out<00:02:57.920> in

00:02:58.000 --> 00:02:58.010 
behind cover and he's standing out in

00:02:58.010 --> 00:03:01.030 
behind cover and he's standing out in
the<00:02:58.040> open<00:02:58.190> now<00:02:58.430> if<00:02:58.670> he<00:02:59.319> runs<00:03:00.319> behind<00:03:00.680> this<00:03:00.739> box

00:03:01.030 --> 00:03:01.040 
the open now if he runs behind this box

00:03:01.040 --> 00:03:04.210 
the open now if he runs behind this box
and<00:03:01.340> looks<00:03:01.700> at<00:03:01.819> us<00:03:02.440> he's<00:03:03.440> behind<00:03:03.709> cover<00:03:03.950> two

00:03:04.210 --> 00:03:04.220 
and looks at us he's behind cover two

00:03:04.220 --> 00:03:07.449 
and looks at us he's behind cover two
now<00:03:04.459> he's<00:03:04.640> gonna<00:03:04.819> win<00:03:05.060> this<00:03:05.270> and<00:03:06.190> the<00:03:07.190> reason

00:03:07.449 --> 00:03:07.459 
now he's gonna win this and the reason

00:03:07.459 --> 00:03:09.339 
now he's gonna win this and the reason
for<00:03:07.489> that<00:03:07.580> is<00:03:07.670> that<00:03:08.060> he<00:03:08.390> gets<00:03:08.420> time<00:03:08.870> to<00:03:08.989> prepare

00:03:09.339 --> 00:03:09.349 
for that is that he gets time to prepare

00:03:09.349 --> 00:03:13.690 
for that is that he gets time to prepare
I'm<00:03:10.190> moving<00:03:11.030> into<00:03:11.950> seeing<00:03:12.950> him<00:03:13.220> but<00:03:13.489> he's

I'm moving into seeing him but he's
standing<00:03:14.150> still<00:03:14.510> so<00:03:14.870> he<00:03:15.380> wins<00:03:15.590> this<00:03:15.769> and<00:03:16.040> phone

00:03:16.479 --> 00:03:16.489 
standing still so he wins this and phone

like<00:03:34.100> this<00:03:34.310> right<00:03:35.209> yes<00:03:36.700> so<00:03:37.700> if<00:03:38.390> we<00:03:38.810> do

00:03:38.920 --> 00:03:38.930 
like this right yes so if we do

00:03:38.930 --> 00:03:40.720 
like this right yes so if we do
something<00:03:39.110> slightly<00:03:39.290> differently<00:03:39.769> and<00:03:40.069> we<00:03:40.519> go

00:03:40.720 --> 00:03:40.730 
something slightly differently and we go

00:03:40.730 --> 00:03:43.809 
something slightly differently and we go
and<00:03:40.850> we<00:03:40.910> look<00:03:41.030> to<00:03:41.150> this<00:03:41.269> window<00:03:42.519> we<00:03:43.519> get<00:03:43.640> a<00:03:43.670> bead

00:03:43.809 --> 00:03:43.819 
and we look to this window we get a bead

00:03:43.819 --> 00:03:45.310 
and we look to this window we get a bead
on<00:03:43.880> him<00:03:44.060> because<00:03:44.209> he's<00:03:44.390> not<00:03:44.510> looking<00:03:44.780> at<00:03:44.870> us<00:03:45.019> so

00:03:45.310 --> 00:03:45.320 
on him because he's not looking at us so

00:03:45.320 --> 00:03:46.810 
on him because he's not looking at us so
a<00:03:45.590> slightly<00:03:46.190> different<00:03:46.370> plan<00:03:46.609> and<00:03:46.760> everything

00:03:46.810 --> 00:03:46.820 
a slightly different plan and everything

00:03:46.820 --> 00:03:48.460 
a slightly different plan and everything
has<00:03:47.150> changed<00:03:47.540> and<00:03:47.600> that's<00:03:47.780> really<00:03:47.989> the<00:03:48.200> core

00:03:48.460 --> 00:03:48.470 
has changed and that's really the core

00:03:48.470 --> 00:03:50.830 
has changed and that's really the core
of<00:03:48.500> frozen<00:03:48.950> Silas<00:03:49.370> we<00:03:49.489> want<00:03:49.670> it<00:03:50.450> to<00:03:50.600> be<00:03:50.720> the

00:03:50.830 --> 00:03:50.840 
of frozen Silas we want it to be the

00:03:50.840 --> 00:03:52.390 
of frozen Silas we want it to be the
best<00:03:50.989> tactics<00:03:51.560> and<00:03:51.709> for<00:03:51.829> tactics<00:03:52.160> field<00:03:52.310> to

00:03:52.390 --> 00:03:52.400 
best tactics and for tactics field to

00:03:52.400 --> 00:03:53.500 
best tactics and for tactics field to
the<00:03:52.430> other<00:03:52.519> tactics<00:03:53.090> that<00:03:53.120> we<00:03:53.239> have<00:03:53.390> to<00:03:53.450> be

00:03:53.500 --> 00:03:53.510 
the other tactics that we have to be

00:03:53.510 --> 00:03:54.580 
the other tactics that we have to be
predicting<00:03:53.930> what<00:03:54.019> your<00:03:54.140> phone<00:03:54.260> is<00:03:54.380> going<00:03:54.530> to

00:03:54.580 --> 00:03:54.590 
predicting what your phone is going to

00:03:54.590 --> 00:03:58.270 
predicting what your phone is going to
do<00:03:54.680> the<00:03:54.799> entire<00:03:55.100> time<00:03:55.400> so<00:03:56.769> this<00:03:57.769> can<00:03:57.980> really<00:03:58.100> go

00:03:58.270 --> 00:03:58.280 
do the entire time so this can really go

00:03:58.280 --> 00:04:00.250 
do the entire time so this can really go
on<00:03:58.400> to<00:03:58.489> the<00:03:58.609> nth<00:03:58.700> degree<00:03:58.930> how<00:03:59.930> many<00:04:00.140> different

00:04:00.250 --> 00:04:00.260 
on to the nth degree how many different

00:04:00.260 --> 00:04:03.520 
on to the nth degree how many different
ways<00:04:00.440> can<00:04:00.769> play<00:04:01.070> along<00:04:02.109> it's<00:04:03.109> an<00:04:03.170> expecting

00:04:03.520 --> 00:04:03.530 
ways can play along it's an expecting

00:04:03.530 --> 00:04:06.099 
ways can play along it's an expecting
that<00:04:03.970> exactly<00:04:04.970> I<00:04:05.120> remember<00:04:05.570> the<00:04:05.600> whole<00:04:05.840> core

00:04:06.099 --> 00:04:06.109 
that exactly I remember the whole core

00:04:06.109 --> 00:04:07.270 
that exactly I remember the whole core
of<00:04:06.230> simultaneous<00:04:06.650> come<00:04:06.829> basis<00:04:07.070> that<00:04:07.190> you

00:04:07.270 --> 00:04:07.280 
of simultaneous come basis that you

00:04:07.280 --> 00:04:08.349 
of simultaneous come basis that you
don't<00:04:07.519> know<00:04:07.579> what<00:04:07.700> your<00:04:07.820> opponent<00:04:07.970> is<00:04:08.150> doing

00:04:08.349 --> 00:04:08.359 
don't know what your opponent is doing

00:04:08.359 --> 00:04:10.120 
don't know what your opponent is doing
and<00:04:08.450> you<00:04:08.510> have<00:04:08.690> to<00:04:08.840> guess<00:04:08.870> if<00:04:09.650> this<00:04:09.920> guy's<00:04:10.100> a

00:04:10.120 --> 00:04:10.130 
and you have to guess if this guy's a

00:04:10.130 --> 00:04:12.280 
and you have to guess if this guy's a
chicken<00:04:10.549> he<00:04:10.670> can<00:04:10.880> go<00:04:11.540> behind<00:04:11.780> us<00:04:11.840> box<00:04:12.049> and<00:04:12.230> you

00:04:12.280 --> 00:04:12.290 
chicken he can go behind us box and you

00:04:12.290 --> 00:04:17.629 
chicken he can go behind us box and you
can<00:04:12.320> dock<00:04:12.910> to<00:04:14.140> to<00:04:15.140> survive<00:04:15.260> another<00:04:15.650> day

00:04:17.629 --> 00:04:17.639 
can dock to to survive another day

00:04:17.639 --> 00:04:20.929 
can dock to to survive another day
where<00:04:18.569> is<00:04:18.659> he<00:04:18.859> he's<00:04:19.859> behind<00:04:20.069> the<00:04:20.219> box<00:04:20.430> but<00:04:20.759> he

00:04:20.929 --> 00:04:20.939 
where is he he's behind the box but he

00:04:20.939 --> 00:04:24.589 
where is he he's behind the box but he
can't<00:04:21.180> see<00:04:21.389> him<00:04:22.009> so<00:04:23.009> this<00:04:23.939> is<00:04:23.969> really<00:04:24.210> want<00:04:24.389> to
