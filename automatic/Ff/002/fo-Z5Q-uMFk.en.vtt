00:00:05.670 --> 00:00:08.910
 is going really well we end up for the 

00:00:07.890 --> 00:00:09.960
 all but the episode of the nuggets 

00:00:08.910 --> 00:00:11.969
 thibaudiÃ¨re at home even crease 

00:00:09.960 --> 00:00:13.679
 episode 8 so today for the 

00:00:11.969 --> 00:00:14.670
 right positive episode environments at 

00:00:13.679 --> 00:00:16.080
 program so I just want to 

00:00:14.670 --> 00:00:17.940
 specify that the players you are going 

00:00:16.080 --> 00:00:19.710
 see in this episode are backgrounds 

00:00:17.940 --> 00:00:21.750
 right and not strikers right 

00:00:19.710 --> 00:00:23.970
 imagine for example favorite authors 

00:00:21.750 --> 00:00:26.099
 you always that motivated our nugget to 

00:00:23.970 --> 00:00:27.869
 tam places you play 

00:00:26.099 --> 00:00:29.760
 right middle is not in this 

00:00:27.869 --> 00:00:31.230
 ranking maybe it's because winger and 

00:00:29.760 --> 00:00:32.820
 lee is entitled in fact me I am based on 

00:00:31.230 --> 00:00:34.320
 sites like sophie end and ultra 

00:00:32.820 --> 00:00:35.790
 violent it needed potentials and so 

00:00:34.320 --> 00:00:37.800
 but so many baby doll road is 

00:00:35.790 --> 00:00:40.260
 right on the left side I decided to 

00:00:37.800 --> 00:00:41.489
 divide in half the right backgrounds and the 

00:00:40.260 --> 00:00:42.420
 right forwards who maybe you want 

00:00:41.489 --> 00:00:44.100
 you nuggets that makes you play right 

00:00:42.420 --> 00:00:46.260
 is in college right striker on this site 

00:00:44.100 --> 00:00:48.270
 so wait and wait for the pilots 

00:00:46.260 --> 00:00:49.440
 on raise them so I'm going 

00:00:48.270 --> 00:00:50.910
 directly the florentin ben ali this port 

00:00:49.440 --> 00:00:53.010
 iter is the biggest potential choice 

00:00:50.910 --> 00:00:54.750
 like law it's gareth bale 

00:00:53.010 --> 00:00:56.219
 here is the present more gareth bale I 

00:00:54.750 --> 00:00:57.690
 what's the use of it and you 

00:00:56.219 --> 00:00:58.829
 know very well who is incredible 

00:00:57.690 --> 00:01:01.020
 do not hesitate to buy it I let go 

00:00:58.829 --> 00:01:02.879
 rock with dortmund it's a pure kiffe 

00:01:01.020 --> 00:01:05.010
 guys it's amazing it's 

00:01:02.879 --> 00:01:06.960
 really great player really fast and 

00:01:05.010 --> 00:01:08.580
 heroes look at everything this player is right 

00:01:06.960 --> 00:01:11.250
 the best middle right of the game I 

00:01:08.580 --> 00:01:13.590
 thought 91 of potential for the gareth 

00:01:11.250 --> 00:01:15.900
 bale the 87 2 general guys you 

00:01:13.590 --> 00:01:19.590
 see that the screen the best potential to 

00:01:15.900 --> 00:01:21.930
 91,92 potential olga then sofiane 

00:01:19.590 --> 00:01:24.299
 feghouli 88.2 potential the little sofiane 

00:01:21.930 --> 00:01:27.240
 feghouli that wells and statures side he 

00:01:24.299 --> 00:01:28.320
 would vote dog at the 50 million level on 

00:01:27.240 --> 00:01:28.590
 the card is worth more than gareth 

00:01:28.320 --> 00:01:29.960
 bale 

00:01:28.590 --> 00:01:33.030
 after I think if you do 

00:01:29.960 --> 00:01:34.079
 of options for the next purchase I 

00:01:33.030 --> 00:01:35.520
 think you can have for me 

00:01:34.079 --> 00:01:37.950
 but that you're bad as very 

00:01:35.520 --> 00:01:39.689
 very expensive the 88th potential is not bad 

00:01:37.950 --> 00:01:40.860
 but it's true that the days that god 

00:01:39.689 --> 00:01:43.500
 takes a loan are a little more 

00:01:40.860 --> 00:01:45.930
 interesting is that three fingers 

00:01:43.500 --> 00:01:47.580
 I was quickly back foot I have a lot 

00:01:45.930 --> 00:01:48.930
 de d'alger are calling for videos 

00:01:47.580 --> 00:01:50.880
 it's not for you to upset the scales and 

00:01:48.930 --> 00:01:51.990
 this with the bowling m it's not really 

00:01:50.880 --> 00:01:53.490
 amazing he has a very very big 

00:01:51.990 --> 00:01:55.920
 potential but it's true that when we 

00:01:53.490 --> 00:01:58.830
 compare will back you want anyway 4 

00:01:55.920 --> 00:02:00.240
 millions of me the greenhouse 26 years like 

00:01:58.830 --> 00:02:01.590
 much more interesting stadiums 

00:02:00.240 --> 00:02:04.620
 that a big five-star ethical gesture 

00:02:01.590 --> 00:02:05.850
 because potential of 80 yields a single point 

00:02:04.620 --> 00:02:07.290
 in any less compared to this fact 

00:02:05.850 --> 00:02:07.890
 nurtured these doubts much more 

00:02:07.290 --> 00:02:10.080
 interesting 

00:02:07.890 --> 00:02:11.910
 the little roadster love since the 83 

00:02:10.080 --> 00:02:13.380
 from the beginning really got very very good 

00:02:11.910 --> 00:02:15.210
 corrado you invite him was the refuge 

00:02:13.380 --> 00:02:16.260
 allowing the chips on him two days 

00:02:15.210 --> 00:02:17.220
 that she is already trying I prefer you 

00:02:16.260 --> 00:02:19.110
 to dwell on the nuggets 

00:02:17.220 --> 00:02:20.520
 here are three of the voide raddo that's 

00:02:19.110 --> 00:02:22.080
 so delayed but it's only a 

00:02:20.520 --> 00:02:23.130
 electric will be full and the fast 

00:02:22.080 --> 00:02:24.480
 acrobatic screen 

00:02:23.130 --> 00:02:27.060
 he's a really great player but 

00:02:24.480 --> 00:02:28.590
 after that is that feghouli and corrado I 

00:02:27.060 --> 00:02:30.480
 do not advise them too much it's true 

00:02:28.590 --> 00:02:32.430
 because is Belgian of advice it is the 

00:02:30.480 --> 00:02:34.020
 better but I wanted to believe 2-2 

00:02:32.430 --> 00:02:35.780
 we do not know too much I advise you to 

00:02:34.020 --> 00:02:38.640
 see patrice nice oxlade chamberlain 

00:02:35.780 --> 00:02:41.580
 later potential of 86 I believe 

00:02:38.640 --> 00:02:43.350
 about october but at age 20 it's 

00:02:41.580 --> 00:02:45.390
 fast it was left that these four 

00:02:43.350 --> 00:02:47.459
 stars he has everything he has the speed and of 

00:02:45.390 --> 00:02:48.600
 acceleration agility is small it is 

00:02:47.459 --> 00:02:49.140
 a small nugget alone side of the 

00:02:48.600 --> 00:02:50.760
 explosives 

00:02:49.140 --> 00:02:52.830
 he's only 20 years old and I thought 

00:02:50.760 --> 00:02:55.200
 you should be honest he sincerely 

00:02:52.830 --> 00:02:56.430
 do not hesitate to jump on him because 

00:02:55.200 --> 00:02:58.260
 that really wanted it's a big 

00:02:56.430 --> 00:03:00.000
 big nugget you do the work 

00:02:58.260 --> 00:03:02.250
 really he said very nice stats the 

00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:03.540
 four- year-old jean paul 85 in dribbling at his 

00:03:02.250 --> 00:03:04.739
 age it's really amazing it's 

00:03:03.540 --> 00:03:07.739
 really a player who can come 

00:03:04.739 --> 00:03:09.420
 unbelievable it was chained key gorodka 

00:03:07.739 --> 00:03:10.830
 this is him I have a lot of beautiful say 

00:03:09.420 --> 00:03:12.510
 but know that it's a player really 

00:03:10.830 --> 00:03:14.050
 very interesting schalke players 

00:03:12.510 --> 00:03:17.680
 this is a little bit 

00:03:14.050 --> 00:03:20.200
 I dredge stern last year red sky 

00:03:17.680 --> 00:03:21.640
 he's middle right l113 of general you 

00:03:20.200 --> 00:03:23.620
 I have technical October 3 and foot 

00:03:21.640 --> 00:03:25.420
 it's not a day that's in game is 

00:03:23.620 --> 00:03:27.490
 extremely interesting I do not you the 

00:03:25.420 --> 00:03:30.250
 hide it's a player who really 

00:03:27.490 --> 00:03:33.700
 a big potential at a potential of 80 3 

00:03:30.250 --> 00:03:34.720
 if he does not cheat he takes it to +10 he has to 

00:03:33.700 --> 00:03:35.830
 every time I introduce you to little ones 

00:03:34.720 --> 00:03:38.080
 players whose class who introduced themselves 

00:03:35.830 --> 00:03:39.520
 the Uighurs is only to you players 

00:03:38.080 --> 00:03:40.900
 intermediates we will say true that a 

00:03:39.520 --> 00:03:43.210
 big big potential do not hesitate to 

00:03:40.900 --> 00:03:44.980
 test his rating to the little technique their 

00:03:43.210 --> 00:03:46.270
 cost his tracks by trimming bad he 

00:03:44.980 --> 00:03:47.440
 do not need a lot of giroux and I got 

00:03:46.270 --> 00:03:49.390
 locked up an error threecities of 8 

00:03:47.440 --> 00:03:51.190
 it's really nothing for a player who 

00:03:49.390 --> 00:03:51.790
 is fast and which frame by correcting 

00:03:51.190 --> 00:03:53.470
 a small club 

00:03:51.790 --> 00:03:55.210
 do not hesitate to take it by 

00:03:53.470 --> 00:03:56.710
 sincerely it's a very good one and we 

00:03:55.210 --> 00:03:57.040
 ends with maxime lopez two players from 

00:03:56.710 --> 00:03:59.170
 om 

00:03:57.040 --> 00:04:00.610
 he likes to say who's the guignol images 

00:03:59.170 --> 00:04:02.740
 and you answer already it's for a 

00:04:00.610 --> 00:04:04.960
 guignol and that two there are still 80 

00:04:02.740 --> 00:04:07.360
 a potential with that with this leap 52 

00:04:04.960 --> 00:04:08.620
 general it comes first a new 

00:04:07.360 --> 00:04:10.120
 update our small and cowardly 

00:04:08.620 --> 00:04:11.800
 authoritarian stove could not 

00:04:10.120 --> 00:04:13.690
 have a lopez maxim and a 

00:04:11.800 --> 00:04:16.810
 tell tale's potential to let go of that 

00:04:13.690 --> 00:04:19.720
 maxime lopez to 59.2 general jose fifa and 

00:04:16.810 --> 00:04:21.100
 a potential of 80 which makes him a 

00:04:19.720 --> 00:04:23.560
 player with one of the biggest potential 

00:04:21.100 --> 00:04:26.890
 of the game it makes him a + 22 November 6 in 

00:04:23.560 --> 00:04:28.510
 6 calculates a potential of 22 slope 

00:04:26.890 --> 00:04:30.760
 general who will take it all along 

00:04:28.510 --> 00:04:32.260
 his career and see happen at 1.80 that's 

00:04:30.760 --> 00:04:33.910
 an acquired right of our bases that debits 

00:04:32.260 --> 00:04:35.830
 Olympic Games to people who follow their 

00:04:33.910 --> 00:04:37.510
 balls that and inevitably he has a very 

00:04:35.830 --> 00:04:39.400
 nice step in touch that assigns son 

00:04:37.510 --> 00:04:41.290
 in his agility speed accelerations 

00:04:39.400 --> 00:04:41.710
 and ex they really have beautiful 

00:04:41.290 --> 00:04:44.140

 that there is for me because I have 

00:04:46.750 --> 00:04:51.169
 videos 

00:04:47.960 --> 00:04:53.300
