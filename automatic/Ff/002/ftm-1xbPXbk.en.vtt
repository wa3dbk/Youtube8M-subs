good things about legumes is their

00:01:08.700 --> 00:01:12.050 
good things about legumes is their
protein<00:01:09.210> value<00:01:09.860> mostly<00:01:10.860> vegetarians<00:01:11.790> are

using<00:01:12.540> legumes<00:01:12.990> for<00:01:13.560> the<00:01:13.680> purpose<00:01:14.159> of<00:01:14.430> gaining

00:01:14.660 --> 00:01:14.670 
using legumes for the purpose of gaining

00:01:14.670 --> 00:01:18.470 
using legumes for the purpose of gaining
good<00:01:15.090> protein<00:01:15.630> and<00:01:16.250> the<00:01:17.250> protein<00:01:17.280> value<00:01:18.180> of

00:01:18.470 --> 00:01:18.480 
good protein and the protein value of

00:01:18.480 --> 00:01:21.530 
good protein and the protein value of
legumes<00:01:19.290> is<00:01:19.650> it's<00:01:20.430> more<00:01:20.729> than<00:01:20.880> twice<00:01:21.180> the

00:01:21.530 --> 00:01:21.540 
legumes is it's more than twice the

00:01:21.540 --> 00:01:23.660 
legumes is it's more than twice the
protein<00:01:21.810> value<00:01:22.440> of<00:01:22.590> grains<00:01:22.950> whole<00:01:23.640> grains

protein value of grains whole grains

00:01:23.670 --> 00:01:26.600 
protein value of grains whole grains
though<00:01:24.270> do<00:01:24.540> have<00:01:24.810> good<00:01:25.170> protein<00:01:25.740> and<00:01:26.040> the

00:01:26.600 --> 00:01:26.610 
though do have good protein and the

00:01:26.610 --> 00:01:29.300 
though do have good protein and the
combination<00:01:27.390> of<00:01:27.570> the<00:01:28.170> protein<00:01:28.650> in<00:01:28.830> legumes

00:01:29.300 --> 00:01:29.310 
combination of the protein in legumes

00:01:29.310 --> 00:01:32.740 
combination of the protein in legumes
and<00:01:29.580> grains<00:01:29.640> gives<00:01:30.570> you<00:01:30.780> really<00:01:31.080> good<00:01:31.650> protein

00:01:32.740 --> 00:01:32.750 
and grains gives you really good protein

00:01:32.750 --> 00:01:35.600 
and grains gives you really good protein
they're<00:01:33.750> also<00:01:33.960> a<00:01:34.200> good<00:01:34.469> source<00:01:34.860> of<00:01:34.950> many

00:01:35.600 --> 00:01:35.610 
they're also a good source of many

00:01:35.610 --> 00:01:38.359 
they're also a good source of many
