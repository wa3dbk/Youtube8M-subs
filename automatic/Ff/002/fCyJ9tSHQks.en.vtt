00:01:30.160 --> 00:01:30.170 
tree I'll show you on the map exactly

00:01:30.170 --> 00:01:33.100 
tree I'll show you on the map exactly
where<00:01:30.500> it<00:01:30.590> is<00:01:31.630> there's<00:01:32.630> three<00:01:32.960> different

00:01:33.100 --> 00:01:33.110 
where it is there's three different

00:01:33.110 --> 00:01:36.940 
where it is there's three different
trees<00:01:33.560> that<00:01:33.770> he<00:01:33.830> can<00:01:33.980> spawn<00:01:34.280> it<00:01:35.650> there<00:01:36.650> that

00:01:36.940 --> 00:01:36.950 
trees that he can spawn it there that

00:01:36.950 --> 00:01:39.460 
trees that he can spawn it there that
one<00:01:37.100> back<00:01:37.340> there<00:01:37.520> that<00:01:37.640> we<00:01:37.760> were<00:01:37.850> first<00:01:38.030> ad<00:01:38.470> and

00:01:39.460 --> 00:01:39.470 
one back there that we were first ad and

00:01:39.470 --> 00:01:45.320 
one back there that we were first ad and
now<00:01:39.650> there's<00:01:39.920> this<00:01:40.520> one

00:01:45.320 --> 00:01:45.330 

00:01:45.330 --> 00:01:47.810 

and<00:01:45.870> finally<00:01:46.620> there's<00:01:46.830> one<00:01:47.010> over<00:01:47.130> here<00:01:47.280> I'm

00:01:47.810 --> 00:01:47.820 
and finally there's one over here I'm

00:01:47.820 --> 00:01:49.040 
and finally there's one over here I'm
not<00:01:47.970> sure<00:01:48.150> if<00:01:48.240> it's<00:01:48.270> ponts<00:01:48.630> right<00:01:48.750> there<00:01:48.960> at

00:01:49.040 --> 00:01:49.050 
not sure if it's ponts right there at

00:01:49.050 --> 00:01:54.430 
not sure if it's ponts right there at
that<00:01:49.080> one<00:01:50.750> but<00:01:51.750> I<00:01:51.780> farm<00:01:52.170> these<00:01:52.670> every

00:01:54.430 --> 00:01:54.440 
that one but I farm these every

00:01:54.440 --> 00:01:59.150 
that one but I farm these every
basically<00:01:55.440> every<00:01:55.650> time<00:01:55.800> i'm<00:01:55.950> online<00:01:56.840> and<00:01:58.160> they

00:01:59.150 --> 00:01:59.160 
basically every time i'm online and they

00:01:59.160 --> 00:02:00.740 
basically every time i'm online and they
you<00:01:59.610> know<00:01:59.670> i<00:01:59.760> tend<00:02:00.060> to<00:02:00.150> find<00:02:00.330> them<00:02:00.570> all

00:02:00.740 --> 00:02:00.750 
you know i tend to find them all

00:02:00.750 --> 00:02:02.330 
you know i tend to find them all
actually<00:02:01.440> there's<00:02:01.590> one<00:02:01.650> there's<00:02:02.100> a<00:02:02.160> couple

00:02:02.330 --> 00:02:02.340 
actually there's one there's a couple

00:02:02.340 --> 00:02:05.330 
actually there's one there's a couple
more<00:02:02.550> trees<00:02:02.850> here<00:02:03.840> it<00:02:03.990> is<00:02:04.080> see<00:02:04.320> so<00:02:05.130> you<00:02:05.220> got

00:02:05.330 --> 00:02:05.340 
more trees here it is see so you got

00:02:05.340 --> 00:02:08.030 
more trees here it is see so you got
this<00:02:05.490> one<00:02:05.670> its<00:02:05.850> tax<00:02:06.120> nest<00:02:06.450> so<00:02:07.410> basically<00:02:07.920> you

00:02:08.030 --> 00:02:08.040 
this one its tax nest so basically you

00:02:08.040 --> 00:02:10.460 
this one its tax nest so basically you
get<00:02:08.220> it<00:02:08.369> and<00:02:09.240> it<00:02:09.600> gives<00:02:09.780> you<00:02:09.899> the<00:02:10.020> ped<00:02:10.229> which

00:02:10.460 --> 00:02:10.470 
get it and it gives you the ped which

00:02:10.470 --> 00:02:12.080 
get it and it gives you the ped which
this<00:02:10.619> once<00:02:10.860> is<00:02:11.160> one<00:02:11.340> of<00:02:11.430> the<00:02:11.520> lower<00:02:11.700> ones<00:02:11.910> so

00:02:12.080 --> 00:02:12.090 
this once is one of the lower ones so

00:02:12.090 --> 00:02:16.340 
this once is one of the lower ones so
you<00:02:12.180> get<00:02:12.300> about<00:02:12.450> 50<00:02:12.780> gold<00:02:13.400> from<00:02:14.400> it<00:02:15.200> but<00:02:16.200> the

00:02:16.340 --> 00:02:16.350 
you get about 50 gold from it but the

00:02:16.350 --> 00:02:21.350 
you get about 50 gold from it but the
others<00:02:16.650> tend<00:02:17.130> to<00:02:17.250> sell<00:02:17.460> for<00:02:17.610> way<00:02:17.820> more<00:02:20.360> now

00:02:21.350 --> 00:02:21.360 
others tend to sell for way more now

00:02:21.360 --> 00:02:22.730 
others tend to sell for way more now
that<00:02:21.390> we've<00:02:21.630> done<00:02:21.810> that<00:02:21.990> let's<00:02:22.350> take<00:02:22.470> you<00:02:22.620> to

00:02:22.730 --> 00:02:22.740 
that we've done that let's take you to

00:02:22.740 --> 00:02:26.540 
that we've done that let's take you to
the<00:02:22.860> other<00:02:22.980> one<00:02:24.860> all<00:02:25.860> right<00:02:26.190> we're<00:02:26.340> here<00:02:26.490> at

00:02:26.540 --> 00:02:26.550 
the other one all right we're here at

00:02:26.550 --> 00:02:29.030 
the other one all right we're here at
the<00:02:26.610> second<00:02:27.030> one<00:02:27.560> basically<00:02:28.560> it<00:02:28.770> spawns

00:02:29.030 --> 00:02:29.040 
the second one basically it spawns

00:02:29.040 --> 00:02:34.310 
the second one basically it spawns
anywhere<00:02:29.490> within<00:02:30.180> this<00:02:30.750> you<00:02:31.650> shape<00:02:31.980> up<00:02:32.190> at<00:02:33.320> the

00:02:34.310 --> 00:02:34.320 
anywhere within this you shape up at the

00:02:34.320 --> 00:02:36.620 
anywhere within this you shape up at the
swallow<00:02:34.560> marsh<00:02:34.910> it's<00:02:35.910> ponce<00:02:36.150> at<00:02:36.330> the<00:02:36.420> base<00:02:36.600> of

00:02:36.620 --> 00:02:36.630
