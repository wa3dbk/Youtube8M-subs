00:00:04.230 --> 00:00:09.690
 I was not expecting them 

00:00:07.700 --> 00:00:12.210
 and now 

00:00:09.690 --> 00:00:13.680
 what I do 

00:00:12.210 --> 00:00:15.780
 the increase that I had to see 

00:00:13.680 --> 00:00:17.820
 in that position is that I did not remember 

00:00:15.780 --> 00:00:19.590
 that in those holidays is 2 for 1 in my 

00:00:17.820 --> 00:00:21.540
 channel I did not remember so I'm sorry 

00:00:19.590 --> 00:00:23.070
 forget what I was doing is before 

00:00:21.540 --> 00:00:25.170
 let's start well with the video let me 

00:00:23.070 --> 00:00:27.450
 tell them at the end I got something with 

00:00:25.170 --> 00:00:30.360
 what had years pending to finish 

00:00:27.450 --> 00:00:33.870
 see the beautiful 'doctor house' series this 

00:00:30.360 --> 00:00:35.460
 beautiful wow wow wow what spectacular 

00:00:33.870 --> 00:00:37.290
 for a month I had the fear of 

00:00:35.460 --> 00:00:39.210
 finish seeing her because after 

00:00:37.290 --> 00:00:40.800
 so many years since I met her in 

00:00:39.210 --> 00:00:42.390
 television about 10 years ago I wanted 

00:00:40.800 --> 00:00:43.860
 I know ending did not end as 

00:00:42.390 --> 00:00:46.170
 I expected the same as all the series 

00:00:43.860 --> 00:00:47.910
 that does not spoil the end because 

00:00:46.170 --> 00:00:49.649
 you will have to see it on your own 

00:00:47.910 --> 00:00:51.539
 they will have to win the 8 seasons 

00:00:49.649 --> 00:00:53.100
 to know the end and believe me it is not going to 

00:00:51.539 --> 00:00:55.700
 be pretty if you like the humor of 

00:00:53.100 --> 00:00:58.580
 doctor house will not be enough 

00:00:55.700 --> 00:01:00.320
 we will miss you treehouse that sad that 

00:00:58.580 --> 00:01:01.910
 is alcohol two years ago 

00:01:00.320 --> 00:01:03.470
 ok let's start with what comes this video 

00:01:01.910 --> 00:01:04.670
 like an image on facebook at 

00:01:03.470 --> 00:01:05.930
 just like a month for you to 

00:01:04.670 --> 00:01:08.030
 they would have me talk in my video 

00:01:05.930 --> 00:01:10.970
 because I fell behind and I could not write 

00:01:08.030 --> 00:01:12.710
 a fucking subject for this video so 

00:01:10.970 --> 00:01:14.660
 well I will grab two comments of the 40 

00:01:12.710 --> 00:01:16.610
 execution that photo and the first subject is 

00:01:14.660 --> 00:01:18.440
 provided for now and piÃ±ero days 

00:01:16.610 --> 00:01:19.490
 the things a girl should do to 

00:01:18.440 --> 00:01:22.340
 that atracts you 

00:01:19.490 --> 00:01:25.040
 damn greedy element but I just 

00:01:22.340 --> 00:01:27.530
 I have eyes for a person wins 

00:01:25.040 --> 00:01:29.270
 so I put it to you be victory justice and 

00:01:27.530 --> 00:01:30.500
 you're going to get a lot of attention right now 

00:01:29.270 --> 00:01:32.630
 to get serious because I want your 

00:01:30.500 --> 00:01:34.460
 question was seriously not quite 

00:01:32.630 --> 00:01:36.380
 bastard say I want you could bring me 

00:01:34.460 --> 00:01:38.000
 a good girl first of all equal 

00:01:36.380 --> 00:01:39.800
 than with any other man that is 

00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:42.320
 pretty a minimum that is pretty to my 

00:01:39.800 --> 00:01:44.210
 tastes and what tastes specifically not 

00:01:42.320 --> 00:01:46.220
 I know I like many types of women 

00:01:44.210 --> 00:01:48.020
 you would like brunette with white 

00:01:46.220 --> 00:01:49.220
 dark hair with light hair that 

00:01:48.020 --> 00:01:51.020
 flame are those of my height or more 

00:01:49.220 --> 00:01:53.600
 shorties with colored eyes 

00:01:51.020 --> 00:01:55.550
 or are black I say are many things but 

00:01:53.600 --> 00:01:57.020
 speaking in attitude of the girl yes that 

00:01:55.550 --> 00:01:59.360
 I could tell you a few things like 

00:01:57.020 --> 00:02:00.530
 for example that is not shy that 

00:01:59.360 --> 00:02:02.210
 involves all aspects 

00:02:00.530 --> 00:02:03.680
 not only for what you think I want 

00:02:02.210 --> 00:02:05.659
 I was afraid to talk about some topic 

00:02:03.680 --> 00:02:07.100
 that seems silly or strange and that 

00:02:05.659 --> 00:02:08.479
 Do not be scared if I give you any subject 

00:02:07.100 --> 00:02:10.340
 just as they like the 

00:02:08.479 --> 00:02:12.080
 video games and we can play together or that 

00:02:10.340 --> 00:02:14.480
 we can talk about them something that yes 

00:02:12.080 --> 00:02:15.950
 I detest a woman is that strawberry is not 

00:02:14.480 --> 00:02:17.569
 I know if everything is like that using that term 

00:02:15.950 --> 00:02:19.819
 but what I mean is that it's very 

00:02:17.569 --> 00:02:21.980
 presumed that he has a lot of money or that 

00:02:19.819 --> 00:02:23.600
 feel that you have a lot of money that 

00:02:21.980 --> 00:02:25.040
 kind of presumption that these women 

00:02:23.600 --> 00:02:27.080
 feel more than other people nothing more 

00:02:25.040 --> 00:02:28.280
 because their parents have money, that is, 

00:02:27.080 --> 00:02:31.370
 even to her from her job 

00:02:28.280 --> 00:02:33.050
 effort their dads do not know how I 

00:02:31.370 --> 00:02:34.910
 I shit something else that could make a 

00:02:33.050 --> 00:02:37.070
 girl to take my attention is not to use 

00:02:34.910 --> 00:02:38.570
 a lot of makeup because I always had 

00:02:37.070 --> 00:02:40.580
 a mentality that a woman has 

00:02:38.570 --> 00:02:42.530
 that being beautiful by nature does not have 

00:02:40.580 --> 00:02:43.760
 to use things to make fair beauty 

00:02:42.530 --> 00:02:45.530
 that's why I prefer women who do not 

00:02:43.760 --> 00:02:47.480
 they use so much makeup I like them 

00:02:45.530 --> 00:02:49.819
 women who tend to wear tennis I do not know 

00:02:47.480 --> 00:02:51.650
 It's a taste that may be weird but it's 

00:02:49.819 --> 00:02:53.150
 what I like to me they enjoy it 

00:02:51.650 --> 00:02:56.420
 go to the movies that they do not like to take 

00:02:53.150 --> 00:02:58.400
 alcohol that you do not like too much or almost 

00:02:56.420 --> 00:03:01.010
 nothing to go to the clubs and talking as in 

00:02:58.400 --> 00:03:03.769
 a relationship that is not very mellow very 

00:03:01.010 --> 00:03:05.390
 sweet very there my love I love you 

00:03:03.769 --> 00:03:07.700
 I bear kiss 

00:03:05.390 --> 00:03:09.110
 that's not the most important thing 

00:03:07.700 --> 00:03:11.090
 I said I can talk with her about 

00:03:09.110 --> 00:03:12.650
 who wants those are the basic things 

00:03:11.090 --> 00:03:13.940
 that a woman could be to call my 

00:03:12.650 --> 00:03:15.709
 attention I think they are not so 

00:03:13.940 --> 00:03:18.050
 complicated or if I forget to me 

00:03:15.709 --> 00:03:20.420
 tell them that you like to take care of yourself in what 

00:03:18.050 --> 00:03:22.790
 is the exercise or eating what 

00:03:20.420 --> 00:03:25.070
 it's practically saying that she is not fat 

00:03:22.790 --> 00:03:27.230
 sorry do not nurse forgiveness there are men who 

00:03:25.070 --> 00:03:28.940
 they like those that are fat to me not me 

00:03:27.230 --> 00:03:30.709
 I am against obesity and fair 

00:03:28.940 --> 00:03:33.739
 that's why we like women who are 

00:03:30.709 --> 00:03:35.060
 filled up by saying a soft way and 

00:03:33.739 --> 00:03:37.340
 now the second theme for this videos 

00:03:35.060 --> 00:03:39.920
 provided by luis daniel mendoza 

00:03:37.340 --> 00:03:41.570
 that says it sounds silly but very serious that 

00:03:39.920 --> 00:03:42.980
 you will talk about batman there is much to say 

00:03:41.570 --> 00:03:45.080
 of this character and thanks for taking me 

00:03:42.980 --> 00:03:46.730
 in account not the net is that I 'm not going to 

00:03:45.080 --> 00:03:48.680
 take into account but how were you 

00:03:46.730 --> 00:03:50.870
 had more likes there in the publication 

00:03:48.680 --> 00:03:55.400
 I had to grab you if they send 

00:03:50.870 --> 00:03:57.019
 donald a weapon that I think of the hot or of 

00:03:55.400 --> 00:03:59.630
 batman because if they are that is hot or not 

00:03:57.019 --> 00:04:02.269
 because with robyn on his two oxen with 

00:03:59.630 --> 00:04:03.709
 they tell me I do not know if it's true or not 

00:04:02.269 --> 00:04:05.180
 there in the league of justice has 

00:04:03.709 --> 00:04:06.950
 many rumors that you do not know 

00:04:05.180 --> 00:04:08.690
 what is true that they do not batman versus 

00:04:06.950 --> 00:04:09.799
 superman the future movie that is going to 

00:04:08.690 --> 00:04:11.300
 follow the next year 

00:04:09.799 --> 00:04:13.790
 it seems very 

00:04:11.300 --> 00:04:15.410
 very bad condition has been seen when 

00:04:13.790 --> 00:04:16.880
 ends a trilogy that has had two 

00:04:15.410 --> 00:04:18.620
 of the best movies of all the 

00:04:16.880 --> 00:04:20.269
 Not only do I say it, I say it 

00:04:18.620 --> 00:04:21.739
 many other people and pages in 

00:04:20.269 --> 00:04:24.110
 internet here ends with that trilogy 

00:04:21.739 --> 00:04:25.970
 and two years later they are going to take out another 

00:04:24.110 --> 00:04:27.980
 it's batman they 're going to change the story and 

00:04:25.970 --> 00:04:29.810
 renewing characters does not seem like a 

00:04:27.980 --> 00:04:31.850
 good option for you yes I feel you navas 

00:04:29.810 --> 00:04:33.500
 it's a desperate way to compete 

00:04:31.850 --> 00:04:34.970
 with marvel batman versus super great 

00:04:33.500 --> 00:04:36.830
 power is a better movie if they take 

00:04:34.970 --> 00:04:38.450
 more in taking it out because I feel that still 

00:04:36.830 --> 00:04:40.130
 it is still talking about batman 

00:04:38.450 --> 00:04:41.570
 christopher nolan just like justice 

00:04:40.130 --> 00:04:44.120
 with spider-man the spider-man movie 

00:04:41.570 --> 00:04:46.070
 3 was taken out in 2007 and five years 

00:04:44.120 --> 00:04:47.450
 then came the one of the surprising 

00:04:46.070 --> 00:04:48.740
 spiderman and nobody remembered very 

00:04:47.450 --> 00:04:51.020
 well of spider-man was already happening 

00:04:48.740 --> 00:04:53.360
 all that impact he had and with batman 

00:04:51.020 --> 00:04:55.400
 it's not super-sounding 'batman today 

00:04:53.360 --> 00:04:57.980
 in day and the following year it will be the same 

00:04:55.400 --> 00:05:00.740
 of sounding and now changing to something else 

00:04:57.980 --> 00:05:02.060
 batman looks like someone chilo because 

00:05:00.740 --> 00:05:04.190
 although you get into that discussion that 

00:05:02.060 --> 00:05:05.630
 if he is a superhero or that he is not just a 

00:05:04.190 --> 00:05:07.220
 rich guy who said ah because I'm not 

00:05:05.630 --> 00:05:09.320
 doing nothing I put on a suit and 

00:05:07.220 --> 00:05:11.270
 kicked with the bad guys but who does not 

00:05:09.320 --> 00:05:13.640
 like that here would not like to be 

00:05:11.270 --> 00:05:16.370
 batman batman me what I'm remembering 

00:05:13.640 --> 00:05:16.849
 the league justice the animated series the 

00:05:16.370 --> 00:05:19.069
 half 

00:05:16.849 --> 00:05:20.839
 what I remember is that Bruce Wayne 

00:05:19.069 --> 00:05:21.439
 had done the league season of the 

00:05:20.839 --> 00:05:23.869
 Justice 

00:05:21.439 --> 00:05:26.119
 bruce wayne is a millionaire has a lot 

00:05:23.869 --> 00:05:28.550
 money but little had enough to 

00:05:26.119 --> 00:05:31.669
 do something like this you see that no mames is 

00:05:28.550 --> 00:05:33.229
 a fucking building in space it shows 

00:05:31.669 --> 00:05:34.759
 that he had money left over and so much 

00:05:33.229 --> 00:05:37.009
 start the company accountants 

00:05:34.759 --> 00:05:39.529
 wayne knowing that thousands are coming out 

00:05:37.009 --> 00:05:40.849
 of millions of dollars from your company and 

00:05:39.529 --> 00:05:42.709
 that they did not know where they were going 

00:05:40.849 --> 00:05:44.179
 they asked for a few days and said no 

00:05:42.709 --> 00:05:45.649
 worry we have many more trillions 

00:05:44.179 --> 00:05:47.149
 do not worry about those hundred thousand 

00:05:45.649 --> 00:05:48.770
 I say that if I have money to 

00:05:47.149 --> 00:05:50.839
 give it away like that and I feel like I'm 

00:05:48.770 --> 00:05:53.269
 rambling about forgiveness is that I can not do 

00:05:50.839 --> 00:05:54.979
 a debate on this great character 

00:05:53.269 --> 00:05:56.629
 I can not I do not like it that much 

00:05:54.979 --> 00:05:58.399
 character to get me so much into his 

00:05:56.629 --> 00:06:00.259
 history to know him personally as 

00:05:58.399 --> 00:06:02.119
 emerged as I changed the movies 

00:06:00.259 --> 00:06:03.469
 that brought out the animated series if I 

00:06:02.119 --> 00:06:05.539
 they like and everything could see their movies 

00:06:03.469 --> 00:06:07.249
 of times when I saw his animated series 

00:06:05.539 --> 00:06:08.719
 when I was a child unfortunately no 

00:06:07.249 --> 00:06:10.580
 Mark me other things mark me 

00:06:08.719 --> 00:06:12.589
 cartoons but that I'll talk in another 

00:06:10.580 --> 00:06:14.659
 video slut mother no manches I'm sorry 

00:06:12.589 --> 00:06:15.889
 Sorry can not bring is a video with a 

00:06:14.659 --> 00:06:18.740
 theme for this 

00:06:15.889 --> 00:06:21.289
 video that can not bring you a topic to 

00:06:18.740 --> 00:06:23.719
 this video sorry it's hard to do two 

00:06:21.289 --> 00:06:25.759
 videos a week but still fulfilling 

00:06:23.719 --> 00:06:27.439
 Even if I die if I die, you know 

00:06:25.759 --> 00:06:29.599
 who was the fault of you here 

00:06:27.439 --> 00:06:31.939
 present exploiting I do not care 

00:06:29.599 --> 00:06:33.259
 it does not matter if you like and you liked this video if 

00:06:31.939 --> 00:06:35.300
 is that it is a girl you already know how 

00:06:33.259 --> 00:06:37.219
 you can attract not being strawberry not being 

00:06:35.300 --> 00:06:39.229
 presumed not pulling you of things not
