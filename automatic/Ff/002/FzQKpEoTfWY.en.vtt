00:06:30.060 --> 00:06:30.070 
negative whatever but I'm a profit I

00:06:30.070 --> 00:06:32.129 
negative whatever but I'm a profit I
just<00:06:30.820> did<00:06:30.970> that<00:06:31.000> because<00:06:31.450> it<00:06:31.599> was<00:06:31.750> easier

00:06:32.129 --> 00:06:32.139 
just did that because it was easier

00:06:32.139 --> 00:06:33.750 
just did that because it was easier
because<00:06:32.620> I<00:06:32.740> didn't<00:06:33.010> want<00:06:33.070> to<00:06:33.190> retype<00:06:33.729> the

00:06:33.750 --> 00:06:33.760 
because I didn't want to retype the

00:06:33.760 --> 00:06:38.640 
because I didn't want to retype the
numbers<00:06:34.210> so<00:06:35.050> i<00:06:35.080> made<00:06:35.349> a<00:06:35.910> 300k<00:06:36.910> profit<00:06:37.650> it

00:06:38.640 --> 00:06:38.650 
numbers so i made a 300k profit it

00:06:38.650 --> 00:06:40.589 
numbers so i made a 300k profit it
wasn't<00:06:39.039> that<00:06:39.250> long<00:06:39.310> guy<00:06:39.760> honestly<00:06:40.300> it<00:06:40.450> wasn't

00:06:40.589 --> 00:06:40.599 
wasn't that long guy honestly it wasn't

00:06:40.599 --> 00:06:42.900 
wasn't that long guy honestly it wasn't
long<00:06:40.810> at<00:06:40.990> all<00:06:41.110> so<00:06:41.889> you<00:06:41.950> can<00:06:42.160> easily<00:06:42.370> do<00:06:42.880> this

00:06:42.900 --> 00:06:42.910 
long at all so you can easily do this

00:06:42.910 --> 00:06:45.740 
long at all so you can easily do this
with<00:06:43.360> beard<00:06:43.990> shields<00:06:44.320> to<00:06:44.410> stuff<00:06:44.590> like<00:06:44.620> that

00:06:45.740 --> 00:06:45.750 
with beard shields to stuff like that

00:06:45.750 --> 00:06:48.089 
with beard shields to stuff like that
downside<00:06:46.750> about<00:06:46.780> is<00:06:47.229> that<00:06:47.530> you<00:06:47.710> only<00:06:47.800> could<00:06:48.010> do

00:06:48.089 --> 00:06:48.099 
downside about is that you only could do

00:06:48.099 --> 00:06:50.730 
downside about is that you only could do
like<00:06:48.220> 24<00:06:48.789> hours<00:06:49.180> so<00:06:49.450> I<00:06:49.630> mean<00:06:49.840> /<00:06:50.020> 4<00:06:50.229> hours<00:06:50.560> so

00:06:50.730 --> 00:06:50.740 
like 24 hours so I mean / 4 hours so

00:06:50.740 --> 00:06:55.050 
like 24 hours so I mean / 4 hours so
that<00:06:50.770> really<00:06:51.160> sucks<00:06:53.190> but<00:06:54.190> you<00:06:54.310> can<00:06:54.430> hold<00:06:54.789> on<00:06:54.940> to

00:06:55.050 --> 00:06:55.060 
that really sucks but you can hold on to

00:06:55.060 --> 00:06:57.210 
that really sucks but you can hold on to
the<00:06:55.150> prices<00:06:55.360> in<00:06:55.720> like<00:06:55.900> your<00:06:56.050> notes<00:06:56.320> you<00:06:57.099> only

00:06:57.210 --> 00:06:57.220 
the prices in like your notes you only

00:06:57.220 --> 00:07:01.200 
the prices in like your notes you only
put<00:06:57.490> in<00:06:57.610> your<00:06:57.789> notes<00:06:58.030> and<00:06:58.560> you<00:06:59.560> just<00:07:00.099> can<00:07:00.940> keep

00:07:01.200 --> 00:07:01.210 
put in your notes and you just can keep

00:07:01.210 --> 00:07:03.270 
put in your notes and you just can keep
it<00:07:01.389> in<00:07:01.479> mind<00:07:01.720> like<00:07:02.380> in<00:07:02.650> the<00:07:02.860> next<00:07:02.979> four<00:07:03.250> hours

00:07:03.270 --> 00:07:03.280 
it in mind like in the next four hours

00:07:03.280 --> 00:07:05.760 
it in mind like in the next four hours
you<00:07:03.639> can<00:07:03.789> try<00:07:04.000> it<00:07:04.060> again<00:07:04.240> at<00:07:04.930> the<00:07:05.080> same<00:07:05.289> prices

00:07:05.760 --> 00:07:05.770 
you can try it again at the same prices

00:07:05.770 --> 00:07:07.529 
you can try it again at the same prices
or<00:07:05.919> like<00:07:06.190> if<00:07:06.639> you<00:07:06.789> think<00:07:07.000> it<00:07:07.090> went<00:07:07.270> up<00:07:07.419> a<00:07:07.510> little

00:07:07.529 --> 00:07:07.539 
or like if you think it went up a little

00:07:07.539 --> 00:07:09.510 
or like if you think it went up a little
then<00:07:07.960> you<00:07:08.080> could<00:07:08.229> put<00:07:08.500> up<00:07:08.620> bill<00:07:09.010> bit<00:07:09.310> higher

00:07:09.510 --> 00:07:09.520 
then you could put up bill bit higher

00:07:09.520 --> 00:07:12.839 
then you could put up bill bit higher
price<00:07:09.880> to<00:07:10.150> buy<00:07:10.270> it<00:07:10.330> off<00:07:10.810> like<00:07:11.020> that<00:07:11.700> so<00:07:12.700> yeah
