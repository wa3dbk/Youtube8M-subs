00:00:52.250 --> 00:00:52.260 
what this does is the mining laser

00:00:52.260 --> 00:00:54.650 
what this does is the mining laser
you'll<00:00:52.649> see<00:00:52.829> the<00:00:52.949> damage<00:00:53.280> it<00:00:53.340> has<00:00:53.489> times<00:00:54.000> three

00:00:54.650 --> 00:00:54.660 
you'll see the damage it has times three

00:00:54.660 --> 00:00:57.470 
you'll see the damage it has times three
now<00:00:54.840> you<00:00:54.899> can<00:00:55.289> find<00:00:55.710> lasers<00:00:56.190> called<00:00:56.820> splitters

00:00:57.470 --> 00:00:57.480 
now you can find lasers called splitters

00:00:57.480 --> 00:00:59.660 
now you can find lasers called splitters
with<00:00:57.899> x<00:00:58.320> three<00:00:58.649> in<00:00:58.770> the<00:00:58.890> damage<00:00:59.190> this<00:00:59.399> is<00:00:59.460> not

you you know hand in this quest and
you're<00:01:27.180> getting<00:01:27.420> in<00:01:27.540> cinder<00:01:27.990> a<00:01:28.020> mining<00:01:28.470> laser

00:01:28.550 --> 00:01:28.560 
you're getting in cinder a mining laser

00:01:28.560 --> 00:01:30.319 
you're getting in cinder a mining laser
let's<00:01:28.920> say<00:01:29.100> and<00:01:29.310> you<00:01:29.400> just<00:01:29.700> don't<00:01:30.000> want<00:01:30.240> it

00:01:30.319 --> 00:01:30.329 
let's say and you just don't want it

00:01:30.329 --> 00:01:32.630 
let's say and you just don't want it
let's<00:01:30.630> see<00:01:30.780> you<00:01:30.900> wanted<00:01:31.259> a<00:01:31.350> shock<00:01:31.710> one<00:01:31.979> all<00:01:32.250> you

00:01:32.630 --> 00:01:32.640 
let's see you wanted a shock one all you

00:01:32.640 --> 00:01:34.609 
let's see you wanted a shock one all you
have<00:01:32.759> to<00:01:32.880> do<00:01:33.060> is<00:01:33.270> leave<00:01:33.900> the<00:01:33.930> game<00:01:34.380> without

00:01:34.609 --> 00:01:34.619 
have to do is leave the game without

00:01:34.619 --> 00:01:36.859 
have to do is leave the game without
quitting<00:01:35.340> just<00:01:35.430> exit<00:01:35.880> the<00:01:35.970> application<00:01:36.750> and

00:01:36.859 --> 00:01:36.869 
quitting just exit the application and

00:01:36.869 --> 00:01:39.469 
quitting just exit the application and
then<00:01:37.320> go<00:01:37.590> back<00:01:37.829> and<00:01:37.880> accept<00:01:38.880> the<00:01:38.970> quest<00:01:39.090> reward

00:01:39.469 --> 00:01:39.479 
then go back and accept the quest reward

00:01:39.479 --> 00:01:41.780 
then go back and accept the quest reward
again<00:01:39.840> and<00:01:40.140> it'll<00:01:40.409> be<00:01:40.500> a<00:01:40.530> different<00:01:40.790> randomly

00:01:41.780 --> 00:01:41.790 
again and it'll be a different randomly

00:01:41.790 --> 00:01:43.819 
again and it'll be a different randomly
generated<00:01:42.329> mining<00:01:42.689> laser<00:01:42.869> do<00:01:43.320> this<00:01:43.470> until<00:01:43.770> you

00:01:43.819 --> 00:01:43.829 
generated mining laser do this until you

00:01:43.829 --> 00:01:46.490 
generated mining laser do this until you
get<00:01:44.070> the<00:01:44.220> version<00:01:44.490> you<00:01:44.820> want<00:01:45.090> so<00:01:45.899> again<00:01:46.229> what

00:01:46.490 --> 00:01:46.500 
get the version you want so again what

00:01:46.500 --> 00:01:48.170 
get the version you want so again what
makes<00:01:46.740> this<00:01:47.070> gun<00:01:47.310> unique<00:01:47.670> is<00:01:47.909> that<00:01:47.939> it

00:01:48.170 --> 00:01:48.180 
makes this gun unique is that it

00:01:48.180 --> 00:01:51.380 
makes this gun unique is that it
basically<00:01:48.360> is<00:01:48.930> that<00:01:48.960> a<00:01:49.380> splitter<00:01:49.950> laser<00:01:50.430> and<00:01:50.850> a

00:01:51.380 --> 00:01:51.390 
basically is that a splitter laser and a

00:01:51.390 --> 00:01:54.770 
basically is that a splitter laser and a
railgun<00:01:51.869> laser<00:01:52.470> had<00:01:53.100> a<00:01:53.130> baby<00:01:53.549> and<00:01:54.119> the<00:01:54.329> result

00:01:54.770 --> 00:01:54.780 
railgun laser had a baby and the result

00:01:54.780 --> 00:01:57.109 
railgun laser had a baby and the result
is<00:01:54.930> the<00:01:55.259> mining<00:01:55.740> laser<00:01:55.890> again<00:01:56.640> much<00:01:56.909> more

00:01:57.109 --> 00:01:57.119 
is the mining laser again much more

00:01:57.119 --> 00:01:59.450 
is the mining laser again much more
damaging<00:01:57.570> your<00:01:57.719> average<00:01:58.140> splitter<00:01:58.590> and<00:01:58.829> much

00:01:59.450 --> 00:01:59.460 
damaging your average splitter and much

00:01:59.460 --> 00:02:02.719 
damaging your average splitter and much

00:02:02.729 --> 00:02:05.539 
more accuracy but still has that x 3 in
the<00:02:03.240> damage<00:02:03.750> it<00:02:04.439> also<00:02:04.590> has<00:02:04.860> the<00:02:04.950> added<00:02:04.979> benefit

00:02:05.539 --> 00:02:05.549 
the damage it also has the added benefit

00:02:05.549 --> 00:02:07.730 
the damage it also has the added benefit
that<00:02:05.579> its<00:02:05.909> beams<00:02:06.270> penetrate<00:02:07.079> targets<00:02:07.560> but

00:02:07.730 --> 00:02:07.740 
that its beams penetrate targets but

00:02:07.740 --> 00:02:10.729 
that its beams penetrate targets but
this<00:02:07.950> rarely<00:02:08.280> comes<00:02:08.759> up<00:02:09.030> now<00:02:09.629> is<00:02:09.899> this<00:02:10.170> gun<00:02:10.470> any

00:02:10.729 --> 00:02:10.739 
this rarely comes up now is this gun any

00:02:10.739 --> 00:02:13.550 
this rarely comes up now is this gun any
good<00:02:11.250> and<00:02:11.550> is<00:02:11.849> it<00:02:12.030> good<00:02:12.270> at<00:02:12.450> the<00:02:12.569> absolute<00:02:12.989> end

00:02:13.550 --> 00:02:13.560 
good and is it good at the absolute end

00:02:13.560 --> 00:02:16.910 
good and is it good at the absolute end
content<00:02:14.250> at<00:02:14.430> level<00:02:14.940> 70<00:02:15.540> well<00:02:15.780> I'm<00:02:16.170> rocking<00:02:16.770> the

00:02:16.910 --> 00:02:16.920 
content at level 70 well I'm rocking the

00:02:16.920 --> 00:02:19.250 
content at level 70 well I'm rocking the
laser<00:02:17.220> Wilhelm<00:02:17.970> build<00:02:18.239> so<00:02:18.390> I've<00:02:18.510> got<00:02:18.720> a<00:02:18.750> lot<00:02:19.080> of

00:02:19.250 --> 00:02:19.260 
laser Wilhelm build so I've got a lot of

00:02:19.260 --> 00:02:22.070 
laser Wilhelm build so I've got a lot of
stuff<00:02:19.500> that<00:02:19.680> increases<00:02:20.670> laser<00:02:21.000> damage<00:02:21.660> so<00:02:22.020> you

00:02:22.070 --> 00:02:22.080 
stuff that increases laser damage so you

00:02:22.080 --> 00:02:23.510 
stuff that increases laser damage so you
may<00:02:22.319> have<00:02:22.500> a<00:02:22.709> little<00:02:23.040> bit<00:02:23.160> of<00:02:23.220> a<00:02:23.280> hard<00:02:23.459> time

00:02:23.510 --> 00:02:23.520 
may have a little bit of a hard time

00:02:23.520 --> 00:02:26.720 
may have a little bit of a hard time
matching<00:02:24.390> my<00:02:24.810> damage<00:02:25.319> output<00:02:25.530> but<00:02:26.370> every

00:02:26.720 --> 00:02:26.730 
matching my damage output but every

00:02:26.730 --> 00:02:28.880 
matching my damage output but every
class<00:02:26.970> has<00:02:27.000> its<00:02:27.239> own<00:02:27.420> awesome<00:02:28.020> attributes<00:02:28.470> so

00:02:28.880 --> 00:02:28.890 
class has its own awesome attributes so

00:02:28.890 --> 00:02:30.680 
class has its own awesome attributes so
you're<00:02:29.099> probably<00:02:29.340> going<00:02:29.730> to<00:02:29.819> come<00:02:30.150> close<00:02:30.450> if

00:02:30.680 --> 00:02:30.690 
you're probably going to come close if

00:02:30.690 --> 00:02:33.650 
you're probably going to come close if
not<00:02:30.870> exceed<00:02:31.650> this<00:02:31.890> damage<00:02:32.310> output<00:02:32.489> now<00:02:33.420> I<00:02:33.450> have

00:02:33.650 --> 00:02:33.660 
not exceed this damage output now I have

00:02:33.660 --> 00:02:35.600 
not exceed this damage output now I have
a<00:02:33.690> corrosive<00:02:34.140> mining<00:02:34.709> laser<00:02:34.890> so<00:02:35.130> you'll<00:02:35.310> see

00:02:35.600 --> 00:02:35.610 
a corrosive mining laser so you'll see

00:02:35.610 --> 00:02:38.839 
a corrosive mining laser so you'll see
me<00:02:35.849> using<00:02:36.330> it<00:02:36.660> on<00:02:36.950> enemies<00:02:37.950> in<00:02:38.190> the<00:02:38.519> Clapp

00:02:38.839 --> 00:02:38.849 
me using it on enemies in the Clapp

00:02:38.849 --> 00:02:41.509 
me using it on enemies in the Clapp
tastic<00:02:39.390> voyage<00:02:39.810> DLC<00:02:40.530> a<00:02:40.560> lot<00:02:40.980> of<00:02:41.130> enemies<00:02:41.370> in

00:02:41.509 --> 00:02:41.519 
tastic voyage DLC a lot of enemies in

00:02:41.519 --> 00:02:44.390 
tastic voyage DLC a lot of enemies in
this<00:02:41.640> DLC<00:02:41.819> have<00:02:42.630> the<00:02:43.140> armor<00:02:43.650> health<00:02:43.920> because

00:02:44.390 --> 00:02:44.400 
this DLC have the armor health because

00:02:44.400 --> 00:02:45.259 
this DLC have the armor health because
you<00:02:44.550> know<00:02:44.670> there<00:02:44.849> are<00:02:44.910> a<00:02:44.940> lot<00:02:44.970> of<00:02:45.060> them<00:02:45.209> are

00:02:45.259 --> 00:02:45.269 
you know there are a lot of them are

00:02:45.269 --> 00:02:47.780 
you know there are a lot of them are
robots<00:02:45.720> and<00:02:45.959> so<00:02:46.530> corrosive<00:02:47.130> is<00:02:47.430> actually

00:02:47.780 --> 00:02:47.790 
robots and so corrosive is actually

00:02:47.790 --> 00:02:48.620 
robots and so corrosive is actually
pretty<00:02:48.120> good

00:02:48.620 --> 00:02:48.630 
pretty good

00:02:48.630 --> 00:02:51.559 
pretty good
in<00:02:48.780> this<00:02:49.350> DLC<00:02:49.620> campaign<00:02:50.489> hence<00:02:51.030> why<00:02:51.239> I'm<00:02:51.299> using

00:02:51.559 --> 00:02:51.569 
in this DLC campaign hence why I'm using

00:02:51.569 --> 00:02:53.809 
in this DLC campaign hence why I'm using
the<00:02:51.810> mining<00:02:52.170> laser<00:02:52.350> corrosive<00:02:53.130> and<00:02:53.340> you'll

00:02:53.809 --> 00:02:53.819 
the mining laser corrosive and you'll

00:02:53.819 --> 00:02:55.850 
the mining laser corrosive and you'll
see<00:02:54.060> that<00:02:54.209> it's<00:02:54.420> very<00:02:54.510> good<00:02:55.110> at<00:02:55.290> melting

00:02:55.850 --> 00:02:55.860 
see that it's very good at melting

00:02:55.860 --> 00:02:58.490 
see that it's very good at melting
enemies<00:02:56.430> especially<00:02:57.019> when<00:02:58.019> you<00:02:58.230> get

00:02:58.490 --> 00:02:58.500 
enemies especially when you get

00:02:58.500 --> 00:02:59.300 
enemies especially when you get
headshots

00:02:59.300 --> 00:02:59.310 
headshots

00:02:59.310 --> 00:03:02.030 
headshots
it<00:02:59.400> is<00:02:59.790> not<00:03:00.090> implausible<00:03:00.660> that<00:03:01.110> all<00:03:01.319> three

00:03:02.030 --> 00:03:02.040 
it is not implausible that all three

00:03:02.040 --> 00:03:04.820 
it is not implausible that all three
shots<00:03:02.340> connect<00:03:03.299> at<00:03:03.540> the<00:03:04.110> enemies<00:03:04.470> head<00:03:04.680> now

00:03:04.820 --> 00:03:04.830 
shots connect at the enemies head now

00:03:04.830 --> 00:03:07.610 
shots connect at the enemies head now
this<00:03:05.010> because<00:03:05.489> the<00:03:06.120> triangular<00:03:06.870> pattern<00:03:07.440> of

00:03:07.610 --> 00:03:07.620 
this because the triangular pattern of

00:03:07.620 --> 00:03:10.220 
this because the triangular pattern of
the<00:03:08.040> distribution<00:03:08.610> when<00:03:08.730> you<00:03:08.819> shoot<00:03:09.060> is<00:03:09.269> fixed

00:03:10.220 --> 00:03:10.230 
the distribution when you shoot is fixed

00:03:10.230 --> 00:03:12.350 
the distribution when you shoot is fixed
so<00:03:10.410> you<00:03:10.440> can<00:03:10.830> get<00:03:11.069> used<00:03:11.280> to<00:03:11.519> where<00:03:11.790> the<00:03:12.000> bullets

00:03:12.350 --> 00:03:12.360 
so you can get used to where the bullets

00:03:12.360 --> 00:03:15.020 
so you can get used to where the bullets
go<00:03:12.720> now<00:03:13.380> this<00:03:13.860> is<00:03:14.010> a<00:03:14.040> blessing<00:03:14.580> and<00:03:14.700> a<00:03:15.000> curse

00:03:15.020 --> 00:03:15.030 
go now this is a blessing and a curse

00:03:15.030 --> 00:03:17.449 
go now this is a blessing and a curse
because<00:03:15.540> at<00:03:15.690> long<00:03:15.989> distances<00:03:16.680> it's<00:03:16.890> pretty

00:03:17.449 --> 00:03:17.459 
because at long distances it's pretty

00:03:17.459 --> 00:03:20.750 
because at long distances it's pretty
much<00:03:17.609> impossible<00:03:17.820> to<00:03:18.570> get<00:03:19.019> all<00:03:19.260> three<00:03:20.100> shots

00:03:20.750 --> 00:03:20.760 
much impossible to get all three shots

00:03:20.760 --> 00:03:22.640 
much impossible to get all three shots
onto<00:03:21.420> a<00:03:21.450> head<00:03:21.720> of<00:03:21.810> the<00:03:21.900> enemy<00:03:22.170> because<00:03:22.290> again

00:03:22.640 --> 00:03:22.650 
onto a head of the enemy because again

00:03:22.650 --> 00:03:24.979 
onto a head of the enemy because again
it's<00:03:22.799> fixed<00:03:23.220> so<00:03:23.400> one<00:03:24.000> will<00:03:24.150> hit<00:03:24.269> and<00:03:24.450> two<00:03:24.780> will

00:03:24.979 --> 00:03:24.989 
it's fixed so one will hit and two will

00:03:24.989 --> 00:03:27.470 
it's fixed so one will hit and two will
miss<00:03:25.230> pretty<00:03:25.530> much<00:03:25.739> every<00:03:26.160> time<00:03:26.489> but<00:03:27.000> even<00:03:27.390> if

00:03:27.470 --> 00:03:27.480 
miss pretty much every time but even if

00:03:27.480 --> 00:03:29.180 
miss pretty much every time but even if
you<00:03:27.600> are<00:03:27.810> hitting<00:03:28.290> all<00:03:28.440> three<00:03:28.500> shots<00:03:28.920> to<00:03:29.160> the

00:03:29.180 --> 00:03:29.190 
you are hitting all three shots to the

00:03:29.190 --> 00:03:31.910 
you are hitting all three shots to the
body<00:03:29.549> and<00:03:29.880> not<00:03:30.090> the<00:03:30.329> head<00:03:30.540> the<00:03:30.959> massive<00:03:31.709> damage

00:03:31.910 --> 00:03:31.920 
body and not the head the massive damage

00:03:31.920 --> 00:03:34.400 
body and not the head the massive damage
from<00:03:32.519> this<00:03:32.700> gun<00:03:32.970> will<00:03:33.390> quickly<00:03:33.780> dispatch

00:03:34.400 --> 00:03:34.410 
from this gun will quickly dispatch

00:03:34.410 --> 00:03:36.740 
from this gun will quickly dispatch
enemies<00:03:34.920> now<00:03:35.790> an<00:03:35.940> important<00:03:36.450> thing<00:03:36.510> to

00:03:36.740 --> 00:03:36.750 
enemies now an important thing to

00:03:36.750 --> 00:03:38.900 
enemies now an important thing to
mention<00:03:36.989> and<00:03:37.319> probably<00:03:37.769> why<00:03:37.950> I<00:03:37.980> thought<00:03:38.700> the

00:03:38.900 --> 00:03:38.910 
mention and probably why I thought the

00:03:38.910 --> 00:03:41.360 
mention and probably why I thought the
modern<00:03:39.180> laser<00:03:39.299> was<00:03:39.600> pretty<00:03:39.989> good<00:03:40.350> is<00:03:40.620> that<00:03:41.190> I

00:03:41.360 --> 00:03:41.370 
modern laser was pretty good is that I

00:03:41.370 --> 00:03:43.490 
modern laser was pretty good is that I
have<00:03:41.549> several<00:03:41.940> things<00:03:42.299> that<00:03:42.510> increase<00:03:42.989> fire

00:03:43.490 --> 00:03:43.500 
have several things that increase fire

00:03:43.500 --> 00:03:45.830 
have several things that increase fire
rate<00:03:43.859> the<00:03:44.069> fire<00:03:44.400> rate<00:03:44.670> of<00:03:44.790> the<00:03:44.910> normal<00:03:45.450> mining

00:03:45.830 --> 00:03:45.840 
rate the fire rate of the normal mining

00:03:45.840 --> 00:03:48.800 
rate the fire rate of the normal mining
laser<00:03:46.019> is<00:03:46.290> like<00:03:46.500> one<00:03:47.069> and<00:03:47.370> so<00:03:47.609> yes<00:03:48.389> it<00:03:48.630> does<00:03:48.780> a

00:03:48.800 --> 00:03:48.810 
laser is like one and so yes it does a

00:03:48.810 --> 00:03:51.500 
laser is like one and so yes it does a
lot<00:03:49.200> of<00:03:49.470> damage<00:03:49.709> and<00:03:50.069> like<00:03:50.250> a<00:03:50.400> lot<00:03:50.790> of<00:03:51.000> damage

00:03:51.500 --> 00:03:51.510 
lot of damage and like a lot of damage

00:03:51.510 --> 00:03:53.300 
lot of damage and like a lot of damage
you'll<00:03:51.630> see<00:03:51.780> again<00:03:52.139> getting<00:03:52.650> those<00:03:52.829> criticals

00:03:53.300 --> 00:03:53.310 
you'll see again getting those criticals

00:03:53.310 --> 00:03:56.210 
you'll see again getting those criticals
is<00:03:53.430> devastating<00:03:54.269> but<00:03:54.690> it<00:03:55.170> is<00:03:55.500> shooting<00:03:55.769> at<00:03:56.040> a

00:03:56.210 --> 00:03:56.220 
is devastating but it is shooting at a

00:03:56.220 --> 00:03:58.940 
is devastating but it is shooting at a
fire<00:03:56.459> rate<00:03:56.609> of<00:03:56.760> again<00:03:57.150> one<00:03:57.540> is<00:03:58.049> pretty<00:03:58.650> darn

00:03:58.940 --> 00:03:58.950 
fire rate of again one is pretty darn

00:03:58.950 --> 00:04:01.940 
fire rate of again one is pretty darn
slow<00:03:59.430> and<00:03:59.940> in<00:04:00.510> addition<00:04:00.840> it<00:04:00.959> takes<00:04:01.139> up<00:04:01.290> seven

00:04:01.940 --> 00:04:01.950 
slow and in addition it takes up seven

00:04:01.950 --> 00:04:04.190 
slow and in addition it takes up seven
ammunition<00:04:02.579> per<00:04:02.760> shot<00:04:03.060> so<00:04:03.329> unless<00:04:03.959> you<00:04:04.170> have

00:04:04.190 --> 00:04:04.200 
ammunition per shot so unless you have

00:04:04.200 --> 00:04:06.860 
ammunition per shot so unless you have
something<00:04:04.829> to<00:04:04.980> regenerate<00:04:05.850> ammo<00:04:06.060> also<00:04:06.690> or

00:04:06.860 --> 00:04:06.870 
something to regenerate ammo also or

00:04:06.870 --> 00:04:08.629 
something to regenerate ammo also or
you're<00:04:07.049> just<00:04:07.079> really<00:04:07.530> on<00:04:07.709> top<00:04:07.950> of<00:04:07.980> collecting

00:04:08.629 --> 00:04:08.639 
you're just really on top of collecting

00:04:08.639 --> 00:04:11.420 
you're just really on top of collecting
ammo<00:04:08.910> from<00:04:09.090> boxes<00:04:09.780> this<00:04:10.290> can<00:04:10.680> really<00:04:11.220> hurt

00:04:11.420 --> 00:04:11.430 
ammo from boxes this can really hurt

00:04:11.430 --> 00:04:14.059 
ammo from boxes this can really hurt
your<00:04:12.120> reserve<00:04:13.079> ammunition<00:04:13.650> because<00:04:13.799> again

00:04:14.059 --> 00:04:14.069 
your reserve ammunition because again

00:04:14.069 --> 00:04:15.979 
your reserve ammunition because again
seven<00:04:14.489> per<00:04:14.639> shot<00:04:14.850> that's<00:04:15.389> a<00:04:15.540> lot

00:04:15.979 --> 00:04:15.989 
seven per shot that's a lot

00:04:15.989 --> 00:04:18.770 
seven per shot that's a lot
so<00:04:16.709> is<00:04:16.950> this<00:04:17.190> gun<00:04:17.459> good<00:04:17.789> in<00:04:17.970> the<00:04:18.060> absolute

00:04:18.770 --> 00:04:18.780 
so is this gun good in the absolute

00:04:18.780 --> 00:04:21.110 
so is this gun good in the absolute
endgame<00:04:19.320> content<00:04:19.650> will<00:04:20.070> I<00:04:20.100> have<00:04:20.370> to<00:04:20.549> say<00:04:20.760> yes

00:04:21.110 --> 00:04:21.120 
endgame content will I have to say yes

00:04:21.120 --> 00:04:23.779 
endgame content will I have to say yes
again<00:04:21.750> you'll<00:04:21.900> see<00:04:22.289> me<00:04:22.500> using<00:04:22.740> it<00:04:23.010> to<00:04:23.370> great

00:04:23.779 --> 00:04:23.789 
again you'll see me using it to great

00:04:23.789 --> 00:04:25.610 
again you'll see me using it to great
effect<00:04:23.849> and<00:04:24.330> I<00:04:24.390> really<00:04:24.690> don't<00:04:24.990> have<00:04:25.050> a<00:04:25.200> need<00:04:25.289> to

00:04:25.610 --> 00:04:25.620 
effect and I really don't have a need to

00:04:25.620 --> 00:04:27.080 
effect and I really don't have a need to
switch<00:04:26.130> weapons

00:04:27.080 --> 00:04:27.090 
switch weapons

00:04:27.090 --> 00:04:29.270 
switch weapons
even<00:04:27.630> when<00:04:27.870> enemies<00:04:28.260> have<00:04:28.560> shields<00:04:29.160> this

00:04:29.270 --> 00:04:29.280 
even when enemies have shields this

00:04:29.280 --> 00:04:31.760 
even when enemies have shields this
weapon<00:04:29.580> is<00:04:29.700> powerful<00:04:30.450> enough<00:04:30.750> that<00:04:30.990> it<00:04:31.530> will

00:04:31.760 --> 00:04:31.770 
weapon is powerful enough that it will

00:04:31.770 --> 00:04:34.760 
weapon is powerful enough that it will
go<00:04:32.280> through<00:04:32.580> those<00:04:32.850> shields<00:04:33.150> and<00:04:33.480> Sten<00:04:34.230> damage

00:04:34.760 --> 00:04:34.770 
go through those shields and Sten damage

00:04:34.770 --> 00:04:37.280 
go through those shields and Sten damage
the<00:04:34.950> armor<00:04:35.340> behind<00:04:35.610> them<00:04:36.090> that<00:04:36.330> being<00:04:36.960> said

00:04:37.280 --> 00:04:37.290 
the armor behind them that being said

00:04:37.290 --> 00:04:39.140 
the armor behind them that being said
one<00:04:37.590> of<00:04:37.620> the<00:04:37.770> main<00:04:37.950> reasons<00:04:38.400> again<00:04:38.760> is<00:04:38.970> because

00:04:39.140 --> 00:04:39.150 
one of the main reasons again is because

00:04:39.150 --> 00:04:41.360 
one of the main reasons again is because
I<00:04:39.419> have<00:04:39.660> an<00:04:39.780> increase<00:04:40.320> to<00:04:40.560> fire<00:04:40.919> rate<00:04:41.190> that

00:04:41.360 --> 00:04:41.370 
I have an increase to fire rate that

00:04:41.370 --> 00:04:43.400 
I have an increase to fire rate that
this<00:04:41.490> gun<00:04:41.730> is<00:04:41.880> more<00:04:42.090> effective<00:04:42.630> so<00:04:42.810> I<00:04:42.990> would

00:04:43.400 --> 00:04:43.410 
this gun is more effective so I would

00:04:43.410 --> 00:04:45.409 
this gun is more effective so I would
describe<00:04:43.770> this<00:04:44.100> gun<00:04:44.400> I<00:04:44.639> canna<00:04:44.940> have<00:04:45.150> to<00:04:45.270> say

00:04:45.409 --> 00:04:45.419 
describe this gun I canna have to say

00:04:45.419 --> 00:04:47.150 
describe this gun I canna have to say
it's<00:04:45.570> good<00:04:45.900> because<00:04:46.139> it's<00:04:46.500> still<00:04:46.740> killing

00:04:47.150 --> 00:04:47.160 
it's good because it's still killing

00:04:47.160 --> 00:04:48.890 
it's good because it's still killing
enemies<00:04:47.460> with<00:04:47.850> great<00:04:48.120> effect<00:04:48.450> but<00:04:48.660> I<00:04:48.690> would

00:04:48.890 --> 00:04:48.900 
enemies with great effect but I would

00:04:48.900 --> 00:04:52.159 
enemies with great effect but I would
describe<00:04:49.410> this<00:04:49.650> gun<00:04:49.889> as<00:04:50.070> a<00:04:50.270> specialty<00:04:51.270> gun<00:04:51.660> if

00:04:52.159 --> 00:04:52.169 
describe this gun as a specialty gun if

00:04:52.169 --> 00:04:54.260 
describe this gun as a specialty gun if
you<00:04:52.230> have<00:04:52.590> a<00:04:52.620> class<00:04:53.040> that<00:04:53.340> really<00:04:53.730> does<00:04:53.970> a<00:04:54.150> lot

00:04:54.260 --> 00:04:54.270 
you have a class that really does a lot

00:04:54.270 --> 00:04:56.390 
you have a class that really does a lot
of<00:04:54.540> damage<00:04:54.870> with<00:04:54.900> criticals<00:04:55.770> per<00:04:56.040> se<00:04:56.250> because

00:04:56.390 --> 00:04:56.400 
of damage with criticals per se because

00:04:56.400 --> 00:04:58.520 
of damage with criticals per se because
this<00:04:56.639> is<00:04:56.700> a<00:04:56.760> pretty<00:04:57.000> accurate<00:04:57.240> weapon<00:04:58.020> and<00:04:58.169> the

00:04:58.520 --> 00:04:58.530 
this is a pretty accurate weapon and the

00:04:58.530 --> 00:04:59.990 
this is a pretty accurate weapon and the
three<00:04:58.770> projectiles<00:04:59.280> make<00:04:59.520> it<00:04:59.639> likely<00:04:59.850> that

00:04:59.990 --> 00:05:00.000 
three projectiles make it likely that

00:05:00.000 --> 00:05:01.820 
three projectiles make it likely that
you<00:05:00.270> know<00:05:00.389> if<00:05:00.479> you<00:05:00.540> aim<00:05:00.720> around<00:05:01.410> the<00:05:01.620> head

00:05:01.820 --> 00:05:01.830 
you know if you aim around the head

00:05:01.830 --> 00:05:03.680 
you know if you aim around the head
you're<00:05:02.220> gonna<00:05:02.490> hit<00:05:02.700> someone<00:05:03.090> in<00:05:03.210> the<00:05:03.270> head<00:05:03.419> so

00:05:03.680 --> 00:05:03.690 
you're gonna hit someone in the head so

00:05:03.690 --> 00:05:04.940 
you're gonna hit someone in the head so
again<00:05:04.200> if<00:05:04.290> you<00:05:04.350> have<00:05:04.440> a<00:05:04.470> class<00:05:04.710> that<00:05:04.889> has

00:05:04.940 --> 00:05:04.950 
again if you have a class that has

00:05:04.950 --> 00:05:07.219 
again if you have a class that has
really<00:05:05.940> really<00:05:06.180> good<00:05:06.330> critical<00:05:06.780> damage<00:05:06.960> and

00:05:07.219 --> 00:05:07.229 
really really good critical damage and

00:05:07.229 --> 00:05:09.650 
really really good critical damage and
requires<00:05:07.800> an<00:05:08.070> accurate<00:05:08.430> weapon<00:05:09.060> or<00:05:09.270> a<00:05:09.300> class

00:05:09.650 --> 00:05:09.660 
requires an accurate weapon or a class

00:05:09.660 --> 00:05:11.750 
requires an accurate weapon or a class
that<00:05:09.960> can<00:05:10.139> massively<00:05:10.530> increase<00:05:11.220> the<00:05:11.400> fire

00:05:11.750 --> 00:05:11.760 
that can massively increase the fire

00:05:11.760 --> 00:05:14.330 
that can massively increase the fire
rate<00:05:12.000> of<00:05:12.180> the<00:05:12.330> weapon<00:05:12.690> to<00:05:13.139> kind<00:05:13.770> of<00:05:13.830> exploit

00:05:14.330 --> 00:05:14.340 
rate of the weapon to kind of exploit

00:05:14.340 --> 00:05:17.090 
rate of the weapon to kind of exploit
the<00:05:14.490> fact<00:05:14.669> that<00:05:14.850> it<00:05:15.690> nerves<00:05:16.050> itself<00:05:16.590> in<00:05:16.740> a<00:05:16.830> slow

00:05:17.090 --> 00:05:17.100 
the fact that it nerves itself in a slow

00:05:17.100 --> 00:05:19.340 
the fact that it nerves itself in a slow
fire<00:05:17.370> rate<00:05:17.400> you<00:05:17.970> are<00:05:18.090> going<00:05:18.360> to<00:05:18.479> want<00:05:18.750> this<00:05:19.020> gun

00:05:19.340 --> 00:05:19.350 
fire rate you are going to want this gun

00:05:19.350 --> 00:05:21.500 
fire rate you are going to want this gun
but<00:05:19.830> if<00:05:19.950> you<00:05:20.070> really<00:05:20.280> don't<00:05:20.639> have<00:05:20.880> too<00:05:21.300> much

00:05:21.500 --> 00:05:21.510 
but if you really don't have too much

00:05:21.510 --> 00:05:24.350 
but if you really don't have too much
stuff<00:05:21.900> that<00:05:22.320> affect<00:05:22.770> the<00:05:23.160> attributes<00:05:23.880> of<00:05:24.060> your

00:05:24.350 --> 00:05:24.360 
stuff that affect the attributes of your

00:05:24.360 --> 00:05:26.270 
stuff that affect the attributes of your
guns<00:05:24.660> you<00:05:25.110> may<00:05:25.350> want<00:05:25.590> to<00:05:25.650> leave<00:05:25.860> this<00:05:26.070> alone

00:05:26.270 --> 00:05:26.280 
guns you may want to leave this alone

00:05:26.280 --> 00:05:28.940 
guns you may want to leave this alone
because<00:05:26.610> by<00:05:27.090> itself<00:05:27.570> completely<00:05:28.050> bland<00:05:28.740> I

00:05:28.940 --> 00:05:28.950 
because by itself completely bland I

00:05:28.950 --> 00:05:30.610 
because by itself completely bland I
don't<00:05:29.130> believe<00:05:29.400> that<00:05:29.430> this<00:05:29.639> is<00:05:29.700> going<00:05:29.940> to<00:05:30.030> be<00:05:30.150> a

00:05:30.610 --> 00:05:30.620 
don't believe that this is going to be a

00:05:30.620 --> 00:05:33.560 
don't believe that this is going to be a
monumentally<00:05:31.620> good<00:05:31.919> gun<00:05:32.280> I<00:05:32.580> hope<00:05:33.240> you<00:05:33.390> guys

00:05:33.560 --> 00:05:33.570 
monumentally good gun I hope you guys
