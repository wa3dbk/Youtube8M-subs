when<00:00:43.710> you<00:00:44.040> give<00:00:45.000> the<00:00:45.120> break<00:00:49.640> didn't<00:00:50.640> do<00:00:50.969> much

00:00:51.790 --> 00:00:51.800 
when you give the break didn't do much

00:00:51.800 --> 00:00:57.920 
when you give the break didn't do much
and<00:00:55.879> carburetors<00:00:56.879> I<00:00:57.120> don't<00:00:57.629> know<00:00:57.750> if<00:00:57.809> it's

00:00:57.920 --> 00:00:57.930 
and carburetors I don't know if it's

00:00:57.930 --> 00:01:01.189 
and carburetors I don't know if it's
something<00:00:58.050> with<00:00:58.320> that<00:00:58.350> but<00:00:58.949> I<00:00:59.570> cleaned<00:01:00.570> it<00:01:00.809> a

00:01:01.189 --> 00:01:01.199 
something with that but I cleaned it a

00:01:01.199 --> 00:01:04.780 
something with that but I cleaned it a
couple<00:01:01.410> days<00:01:01.530> ago<00:01:03.049> looked<00:01:04.049> like<00:01:04.199> everything

00:01:04.780 --> 00:01:04.790 
couple days ago looked like everything

00:01:04.790 --> 00:01:08.420 
couple days ago looked like everything
what<00:01:05.790> went<00:01:05.970> through<00:01:06.030> it<00:01:06.299> good<00:01:06.510> and<00:01:06.750> I<00:01:06.810> think<00:01:07.430> we

00:01:08.420 --> 00:01:08.430 
what went through it good and I think we

00:01:08.430 --> 00:01:15.560 
what went through it good and I think we
fit<00:01:08.820> the<00:01:08.970> tuning<00:01:09.689> issue<00:01:11.810> and<00:01:12.810> you<00:01:14.540> bought<00:01:15.540> a

00:01:15.560 --> 00:01:15.570 
fit the tuning issue and you bought a

00:01:15.570 --> 00:01:23.600 
fit the tuning issue and you bought a
new<00:01:15.810> spark<00:01:16.290> plug<00:01:16.590> for<00:01:16.920> it<00:01:17.070> to<00:01:19.310> hold<00:01:20.330> on<00:01:22.610> over

00:01:23.600 --> 00:01:23.610 
new spark plug for it to hold on over

00:01:23.610 --> 00:01:38.480 
new spark plug for it to hold on over
here

00:01:38.480 --> 00:01:38.490 

00:01:38.490 --> 00:01:50.460

photo<00:01:51.039> I<00:01:52.140> tried<00:01:53.140> stuffing<00:01:53.530> it<00:01:54.009> without<00:01:54.789> the

00:01:54.990 --> 00:01:55.000 
photo I tried stuffing it without the

00:02:00.419 --> 00:02:00.429 
post art I mean without the spark plug

00:02:00.429 --> 00:02:03.480 
post art I mean without the spark plug
it<00:02:01.149> like<00:02:01.960> does<00:02:02.470> this<00:02:02.619> sound<00:02:02.890> that<00:02:03.130> I<00:02:03.159> will<00:02:03.310> turn

00:02:03.480 --> 00:02:03.490 
it like does this sound that I will turn

00:02:03.490 --> 00:02:18.270 
it like does this sound that I will turn
on<00:02:03.850> so<00:02:11.730> right<00:02:13.470> it<00:02:14.470> looks<00:02:14.680> moist<00:02:15.160> than<00:02:15.459> man<00:02:17.280> like

00:02:18.270 --> 00:02:18.280 
on so right it looks moist than man like

00:02:18.280 --> 00:02:25.080 
on so right it looks moist than man like
i<00:02:18.430> try<00:02:18.640> to<00:02:19.260> push<00:02:20.260> that<00:02:20.470> it<00:02:20.709> goes<00:02:20.980> like<00:02:23.940> if<00:02:24.940> i

00:02:25.080 --> 00:02:25.090 
i try to push that it goes like if i

00:02:25.090 --> 00:02:28.229 
i try to push that it goes like if i
keep<00:02:25.269> the<00:02:25.330> old<00:02:25.870> it'll<00:02:26.290> do<00:02:26.470> that<00:02:26.650> it<00:02:27.489> feels<00:02:28.060> like

00:02:28.229 --> 00:02:28.239 
keep the old it'll do that it feels like

00:02:28.239 --> 00:02:31.080 
keep the old it'll do that it feels like
it<00:02:28.420> has<00:02:28.569> good<00:02:28.780> compression<00:02:29.730> because<00:02:30.730> when<00:02:31.060> I

00:02:31.080 --> 00:02:31.090 
it has good compression because when I

00:02:31.090 --> 00:02:33.120 
it has good compression because when I
hold<00:02:31.390> it<00:02:31.569> actually<00:02:32.079> wants<00:02:32.410> to<00:02:32.440> push<00:02:32.709> my<00:02:32.920> hand

00:02:33.120 --> 00:02:33.130 
hold it actually wants to push my hand

00:02:33.130 --> 00:02:42.370 
hold it actually wants to push my hand
away<00:02:33.340> I<00:02:39.540> don't<00:02:40.540> know<00:02:40.630> if<00:02:40.750> it's

00:02:49.150 --> 00:02:49.160 
if it's good compression or not yeah if

00:02:49.160 --> 00:02:50.380
