00:00:37.610 --> 00:00:37.620 
and then just cut a heart shape out of

00:00:37.620 --> 00:00:48.680 
and then just cut a heart shape out of
the<00:00:37.800> entire<00:00:38.070> pile<00:00:46.969> divide<00:00:47.969> your<00:00:48.180> hearts<00:00:48.510> into

00:02:09.810 --> 00:02:11.780 
over and then once you have both piles
finished<00:02:10.349> you'll<00:02:10.800> glue<00:02:11.099> them<00:02:11.250> both<00:02:11.459> together

00:02:11.780 --> 00:02:11.790 
finished you'll glue them both together

00:02:11.790 --> 00:02:12.580 
finished you'll glue them both together
just

00:02:12.580 --> 00:02:12.590 
just

dry<00:02:21.760> so<00:02:22.760> once<00:02:23.000> your<00:02:23.150> tissue<00:02:23.330> paper<00:02:23.450> hearts<00:02:24.019> are

00:02:24.190 --> 00:02:24.200 
dry so once your tissue paper hearts are

00:02:24.200 --> 00:02:26.589 
dry so once your tissue paper hearts are
dry<00:02:24.470> just<00:02:25.069> take<00:02:25.250> a<00:02:25.280> glue<00:02:25.610> stick<00:02:25.940> and<00:02:26.120> smear<00:02:26.569> a

00:02:26.589 --> 00:02:26.599 
dry just take a glue stick and smear a

00:02:26.599 --> 00:02:29.680 
dry just take a glue stick and smear a
little<00:02:26.989> bit<00:02:27.110> of<00:02:27.200> glue<00:02:27.530> on<00:02:27.860> both<00:02:28.670> sides<00:02:29.060> of<00:02:29.450> the

little bit of glue on both sides of the

00:02:29.690 --> 00:02:35.860 
little bit of glue on both sides of the
pile<00:02:29.959> and<00:02:33.910> then<00:02:34.910> you're<00:02:35.090> just<00:02:35.180> going<00:02:35.390> to<00:02:35.510> slide

00:02:35.860 --> 00:02:35.870 
pile and then you're just going to slide

00:02:35.870 --> 00:02:37.930 
pile and then you're just going to slide
the<00:02:36.110> folded<00:02:36.470> heart<00:02:36.709> right<00:02:37.280> into<00:02:37.489> the<00:02:37.580> fold<00:02:37.819> of
