in Maya and you're going to be doing a

00:00:10.019 --> 00:00:12.169 
in Maya and you're going to be doing a
lot<00:00:10.200> of<00:00:10.469> it<00:00:10.620> if<00:00:11.219> you<00:00:11.340> do<00:00:11.460> a<00:00:11.490> lot<00:00:11.700> of<00:00:11.730> graphics

work with titling and whatnot and so

00:00:14.549 --> 00:00:17.269 
work with titling and whatnot and so
let's<00:00:15.150> just<00:00:15.480> take<00:00:15.809> a<00:00:15.839> look<00:00:16.139> at<00:00:16.350> the<00:00:16.500> basics<00:00:17.039> of

00:01:11.120 --> 00:01:11.130 
to be my like font I remember some fonts

00:01:11.130 --> 00:01:13.250 
to be my like font I remember some fonts
are<00:01:11.250> not<00:01:11.880> going<00:01:12.210> to<00:01:12.360> work<00:01:12.540> I<00:01:12.750> have<00:01:12.900> a<00:01:12.930> bunch<00:01:13.140> of

00:01:13.250 --> 00:01:13.260 
are not going to work I have a bunch of

00:01:13.260 --> 00:01:14.929 
are not going to work I have a bunch of
custom<00:01:13.680> fonts<00:01:14.010> in<00:01:14.130> here<00:01:14.310> that<00:01:14.460> were<00:01:14.580> produced

00:01:14.929 --> 00:01:14.939 
custom fonts in here that were produced

00:01:14.939 --> 00:01:16.580 
custom fonts in here that were produced
in<00:01:15.090> Illustrator<00:01:15.689> and<00:01:15.720> some<00:01:15.960> other<00:01:16.110> programs

00:01:16.580 --> 00:01:16.590 
in Illustrator and some other programs

00:01:16.590 --> 00:01:19.609 
in Illustrator and some other programs
and<00:01:16.890> and<00:01:17.159> fonts<00:01:17.970> really<00:01:18.270> are<00:01:18.659> based<00:01:18.930> on<00:01:19.170> curves

00:01:19.609 --> 00:01:19.619 
and and fonts really are based on curves

00:01:19.619 --> 00:01:23.539 
and and fonts really are based on curves
or<00:01:20.009> the<00:01:20.520> text<00:01:20.939> version<00:01:21.840> in<00:01:22.530> Maya<00:01:22.830> is<00:01:23.040> based<00:01:23.369> on

00:01:23.539 --> 00:01:23.549 
or the text version in Maya is based on

00:01:23.549 --> 00:01:26.840 
or the text version in Maya is based on
a<00:01:23.580> curve<00:01:23.850> so<00:01:24.659> let's<00:01:25.560> just<00:01:25.890> sort<00:01:26.549> of<00:01:26.610> stick<00:01:26.790> with

00:01:26.840 --> 00:01:26.850 
a curve so let's just sort of stick with

00:01:26.850 --> 00:01:29.990 
a curve so let's just sort of stick with
a<00:01:27.000> basic<00:01:27.540> font<00:01:28.380> for<00:01:28.650> the<00:01:28.710> moment<00:01:29.070> and<00:01:29.159> under

00:01:29.990 --> 00:01:30.000 
a basic font for the moment and under

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:32.330 
a basic font for the moment and under
here<00:01:30.329> you<00:01:30.479> can<00:01:30.630> see<00:01:30.840> where<00:01:30.990> it<00:01:31.140> says<00:01:31.170> the<00:01:32.070> type

00:01:32.330 --> 00:01:32.340 
here you can see where it says the type

00:01:32.340 --> 00:01:34.310 
here you can see where it says the type
what<00:01:32.700> type<00:01:32.939> do<00:01:33.119> we<00:01:33.240> want<00:01:33.450> do<00:01:33.630> we<00:01:33.659> want<00:01:33.930> this<00:01:34.110> to

00:01:34.310 --> 00:01:34.320 
what type do we want do we want this to

00:01:34.320 --> 00:01:37.130 
what type do we want do we want this to
be<00:01:34.439> a<00:01:34.470> curves<00:01:35.250> set<00:01:35.880> that<00:01:36.240> spells<00:01:36.540> out<00:01:36.750> this

00:01:37.130 --> 00:01:37.140 
be a curves set that spells out this

00:01:37.140 --> 00:01:41.030 
be a curves set that spells out this
this<00:01:37.470> text<00:01:37.979> or<00:01:38.189> a<00:01:38.460> trim<00:01:39.150> a<00:01:39.420> poly<00:01:39.810> or<00:01:40.110> a<00:01:40.530> bevel

00:01:41.030 --> 00:01:41.040 
this text or a trim a poly or a bevel

00:01:41.040 --> 00:01:43.700 
this text or a trim a poly or a bevel
and<00:01:41.250> in<00:01:42.030> this<00:01:42.150> case<00:01:42.390> let's<00:01:42.930> just<00:01:43.170> choose<00:01:43.409> bevel

00:01:43.700 --> 00:01:43.710 
and in this case let's just choose bevel

00:01:43.710 --> 00:01:46.130 
and in this case let's just choose bevel
so<00:01:44.189> go<00:01:44.399> ahead<00:01:44.549> and<00:01:44.700> click<00:01:45.090> on<00:01:45.270> bevel<00:01:45.570> there<00:01:45.899> for

00:01:46.130 --> 00:01:46.140 
so go ahead and click on bevel there for

00:01:46.140 --> 00:01:47.660 
so go ahead and click on bevel there for
the<00:01:46.229> moment<00:01:46.590> and<00:01:46.710> we'll<00:01:47.070> go<00:01:47.310> over<00:01:47.399> these<00:01:47.640> other

00:01:47.660 --> 00:01:47.670 
the moment and we'll go over these other

00:01:47.670 --> 00:01:49.700 
the moment and we'll go over these other
ones<00:01:48.090> in<00:01:48.270> different<00:01:48.450> tutorials<00:01:49.229> but<00:01:49.409> for<00:01:49.649> the

00:01:49.700 --> 00:01:49.710 
ones in different tutorials but for the

00:01:49.710 --> 00:01:51.770 
ones in different tutorials but for the
moment<00:01:49.890> let's<00:01:50.610> just<00:01:50.700> choose<00:01:51.090> bevel<00:01:51.570> and

00:01:51.770 --> 00:01:51.780 
moment let's just choose bevel and

00:01:51.780 --> 00:01:54.499 
moment let's just choose bevel and
you'll<00:01:52.350> notice<00:01:52.649> that<00:01:52.860> by<00:01:53.520> default<00:01:53.729> usually

00:01:54.499 --> 00:01:54.509 
you'll notice that by default usually

00:01:54.509 --> 00:01:56.450 
you'll notice that by default usually
it's<00:01:54.630> going<00:01:54.899> to<00:01:55.049> create<00:01:55.590> the<00:01:55.829> bevel<00:01:56.159> at<00:01:56.310> the

00:01:56.450 --> 00:01:56.460 
it's going to create the bevel at the

00:01:56.460 --> 00:01:59.480 
it's going to create the bevel at the
start<00:01:56.759> and<00:01:57.119> at<00:01:57.270> the<00:01:57.450> end<00:01:57.659> and<00:01:58.189> it's<00:01:59.189> going<00:01:59.369> to

00:01:59.480 --> 00:01:59.490 
start and at the end and it's going to

00:01:59.490 --> 00:02:03.260 
start and at the end and it's going to
have<00:01:59.579> a<00:01:59.610> bevel<00:01:59.909> width<00:02:00.270> of<00:02:01.340> 10.1<00:02:02.340> at<00:02:02.670> depth<00:02:03.090> of

00:02:03.260 --> 00:02:03.270 
have a bevel width of 10.1 at depth of

00:02:03.270 --> 00:02:06.850 
have a bevel width of 10.1 at depth of
0.1<00:02:03.719> exclude<00:02:04.439> distance<00:02:04.920> of<00:02:05.130> 0.25<00:02:05.880> oh<00:02:06.180> and

00:02:06.850 --> 00:02:06.860 
0.1 exclude distance of 0.25 oh and

00:02:06.860 --> 00:02:09.790 
0.1 exclude distance of 0.25 oh and
those<00:02:07.860> are<00:02:08.069> sort<00:02:08.340> of<00:02:08.399> the<00:02:08.550> starting<00:02:09.090> default

00:02:09.790 --> 00:02:09.800 
those are sort of the starting default

00:02:09.800 --> 00:02:12.470 
those are sort of the starting default
choices<00:02:10.800> that<00:02:11.220> Maya<00:02:11.580> would<00:02:11.790> make<00:02:12.030> for

00:02:12.470 --> 00:02:12.480 
choices that Maya would make for

00:02:12.480 --> 00:02:14.089 
choices that Maya would make for
creating<00:02:13.410> this<00:02:13.560> tack

00:02:14.089 --> 00:02:14.099 
creating this tack

00:02:14.099 --> 00:02:17.030 
creating this tack
and<00:02:14.189> the<00:02:14.969> bevel<00:02:15.299> style<00:02:15.659> is<00:02:16.019> going<00:02:16.290> to<00:02:16.409> be<00:02:16.530> going

00:02:17.030 --> 00:02:17.040 
and the bevel style is going to be going

00:02:17.040 --> 00:02:19.459 
and the bevel style is going to be going
basically<00:02:17.489> straight<00:02:18.030> out<00:02:18.239> and<00:02:18.510> then<00:02:19.230> down

00:02:19.459 --> 00:02:19.469 
basically straight out and then down

00:02:19.469 --> 00:02:21.589 
basically straight out and then down
here<00:02:19.500> the<00:02:19.980> inner<00:02:20.099> bevel<00:02:20.370> style<00:02:20.790> you<00:02:21.180> can<00:02:21.359> see

00:02:21.589 --> 00:02:21.599 
here the inner bevel style you can see

00:02:21.599 --> 00:02:23.660 
here the inner bevel style you can see
it's<00:02:22.170> checked<00:02:22.560> off<00:02:22.769> as<00:02:23.010> being<00:02:23.250> the<00:02:23.370> same<00:02:23.609> as

00:02:23.660 --> 00:02:23.670 
it's checked off as being the same as

00:02:23.670 --> 00:02:25.699 
it's checked off as being the same as
the<00:02:23.849> outer<00:02:24.120> style<00:02:24.599> which<00:02:24.989> is<00:02:25.170> this<00:02:25.349> straight

00:02:25.699 --> 00:02:25.709 
the outer style which is this straight

00:02:25.709 --> 00:02:28.160 
the outer style which is this straight
out<00:02:25.920> so<00:02:26.700> that's<00:02:27.299> about<00:02:27.540> it

00:02:28.160 --> 00:02:28.170 
out so that's about it

00:02:28.170 --> 00:02:30.080 
out so that's about it
all<00:02:28.230> I<00:02:28.290> have<00:02:28.650> to<00:02:28.799> do<00:02:28.950> now<00:02:29.159> is<00:02:29.189> just<00:02:29.459> click<00:02:29.969> the

00:02:30.080 --> 00:02:30.090 
all I have to do now is just click the

00:02:30.090 --> 00:02:32.539 
all I have to do now is just click the
Create<00:02:30.420> button<00:02:30.689> and<00:02:31.079> there<00:02:31.980> it<00:02:32.010> is

00:02:32.539 --> 00:02:32.549 
Create button and there it is

00:02:32.549 --> 00:02:37.819 
Create button and there it is
so<00:02:33.180> it<00:02:33.720> shows<00:02:34.109> up<00:02:34.409> and<00:02:34.650> it<00:02:35.430> is<00:02:36.200> right<00:02:37.200> like<00:02:37.379> that

00:02:37.819 --> 00:02:37.829 
so it shows up and it is right like that

00:02:37.829 --> 00:02:39.710 
so it shows up and it is right like that
now<00:02:38.129> if<00:02:38.280> yours<00:02:38.489> doesn't<00:02:38.849> look<00:02:39.060> like<00:02:39.269> this<00:02:39.510> to

00:02:39.710 --> 00:02:39.720 
now if yours doesn't look like this to

00:02:39.720 --> 00:02:42.369 
now if yours doesn't look like this to
start<00:02:40.049> with<00:02:40.139> you<00:02:40.470> may<00:02:40.650> have<00:02:40.889> to<00:02:41.040> turn<00:02:41.250> on<00:02:41.489> your

00:02:42.369 --> 00:02:42.379 
start with you may have to turn on your

00:02:42.379 --> 00:02:46.399 
start with you may have to turn on your
the<00:02:43.379> solid<00:02:44.099> smooth<00:02:44.579> shading<00:02:45.150> and<00:02:45.359> then<00:02:46.139> I

00:02:46.399 --> 00:02:46.409 
the solid smooth shading and then I

00:02:46.409 --> 00:02:51.949 
the solid smooth shading and then I
usually<00:02:46.829> turn<00:02:47.159> my<00:02:47.519> my<00:02:49.250> wireframe<00:02:50.250> on<00:02:50.400> so<00:02:50.959> there

00:02:51.949 --> 00:02:51.959 
usually turn my my wireframe on so there

00:02:51.959 --> 00:02:55.940 
usually turn my my wireframe on so there
you<00:02:52.079> go<00:02:52.819> pretty<00:02:53.819> basic<00:02:54.109> you<00:02:55.109> can<00:02:55.260> control<00:02:55.709> this

00:02:55.940 --> 00:02:55.950 
you go pretty basic you can control this

00:02:55.950 --> 00:02:58.940 
you go pretty basic you can control this
text<00:02:56.430> and<00:02:56.609> the<00:02:56.909> bevel<00:02:57.299> now<00:02:57.480> with<00:02:58.349> some<00:02:58.560> various

00:02:58.940 --> 00:02:58.950 
text and the bevel now with some various

00:02:58.950 --> 00:03:02.240 
text and the bevel now with some various
controls<00:02:59.549> so<00:03:00.120> if<00:03:00.480> I<00:03:00.689> choose<00:03:00.959> my<00:03:01.019> chooser<00:03:01.530> over

00:03:02.240 --> 00:03:02.250 
controls so if I choose my chooser over

00:03:02.250 --> 00:03:04.879 
controls so if I choose my chooser over
here<00:03:02.549> go<00:03:02.939> to<00:03:03.000> the<00:03:03.180> chooser<00:03:03.450> and<00:03:03.750> let's<00:03:04.620> grab

00:03:04.879 --> 00:03:04.889 
here go to the chooser and let's grab

00:03:04.889 --> 00:03:08.149 
here go to the chooser and let's grab
that<00:03:04.919> a<00:03:05.159> whole<00:03:05.549> lot<00:03:06.450> and<00:03:06.840> if<00:03:07.709> we<00:03:07.859> come<00:03:08.040> up<00:03:08.129> here

00:03:08.149 --> 00:03:08.159 
that a whole lot and if we come up here

00:03:08.159 --> 00:03:10.729 
that a whole lot and if we come up here
we<00:03:08.370> will<00:03:08.669> notice<00:03:09.000> where<00:03:09.359> it's<00:03:09.599> sitting<00:03:09.959> in<00:03:10.139> XY

00:03:10.729 --> 00:03:10.739 
we will notice where it's sitting in XY

00:03:10.739 --> 00:03:13.970 
we will notice where it's sitting in XY
and<00:03:10.919> z<00:03:11.129> space<00:03:11.310> and<00:03:11.849> if<00:03:12.299> I<00:03:12.419> click<00:03:12.689> on<00:03:12.900> a<00:03:13.230> move

00:03:13.970 --> 00:03:13.980 
and z space and if I click on a move

00:03:13.980 --> 00:03:15.800 
and z space and if I click on a move
tool<00:03:14.310> or<00:03:14.549> something<00:03:14.790> like<00:03:15.060> that<00:03:15.120> over<00:03:15.569> here

00:03:15.800 --> 00:03:15.810 
tool or something like that over here

00:03:15.810 --> 00:03:18.229 
tool or something like that over here
and<00:03:16.109> then<00:03:16.260> my<00:03:16.530> camera<00:03:17.069> will<00:03:17.370> move<00:03:17.549> over<00:03:17.879> here<00:03:18.180> a

00:03:18.229 --> 00:03:18.239 
and then my camera will move over here a

00:03:18.239 --> 00:03:18.920 
and then my camera will move over here a
little<00:03:18.419> bit

00:03:18.920 --> 00:03:18.930 
little bit

00:03:18.930 --> 00:03:22.879 
little bit
and<00:03:19.159> you<00:03:20.159> can<00:03:20.340> see<00:03:20.609> where<00:03:21.019> that's<00:03:22.019> the<00:03:22.440> center

00:03:22.879 --> 00:03:22.889 
and you can see where that's the center

00:03:22.889 --> 00:03:25.789 
and you can see where that's the center
point<00:03:23.159> the<00:03:23.519> origin<00:03:24.109> basically<00:03:25.109> starting<00:03:25.650> in

00:03:25.789 --> 00:03:25.799 
point the origin basically starting in

00:03:25.799 --> 00:03:28.430 
point the origin basically starting in
here<00:03:26.400> is<00:03:26.579> right<00:03:27.150> there<00:03:27.329> you<00:03:27.780> can<00:03:27.930> adjust<00:03:28.260> this

00:03:28.430 --> 00:03:28.440 
here is right there you can adjust this

00:03:28.440 --> 00:03:30.860 
here is right there you can adjust this
however<00:03:28.620> you<00:03:28.979> see<00:03:29.190> fit<00:03:29.389> for<00:03:30.389> the<00:03:30.449> moment<00:03:30.750> we'll

00:03:30.860 --> 00:03:30.870 
however you see fit for the moment we'll

00:03:30.870 --> 00:03:33.860 
however you see fit for the moment we'll
just<00:03:31.049> leave<00:03:31.409> it<00:03:31.530> there<00:03:31.709> so<00:03:32.549> that's<00:03:33.120> our<00:03:33.329> text

00:03:33.860 --> 00:03:33.870 
just leave it there so that's our text

00:03:33.870 --> 00:03:36.409 
just leave it there so that's our text
and<00:03:34.310> let's<00:03:35.310> take<00:03:35.579> a<00:03:35.639> look<00:03:35.879> at<00:03:36.060> some<00:03:36.269> other

00:03:36.409 --> 00:03:36.419 
and let's take a look at some other

00:03:36.419 --> 00:03:38.539 
and let's take a look at some other
options<00:03:36.510> if<00:03:37.319> you<00:03:37.620> come<00:03:37.769> up<00:03:37.799> in<00:03:38.069> here<00:03:38.220> into<00:03:38.400> the

tab window we're going to be able to see

00:03:41.190 --> 00:03:44.119 
tab window we're going to be able to see
that<00:03:41.849> this<00:03:42.060> this<00:03:42.479> text<00:03:42.959> object<00:03:43.379> is<00:03:43.530> a<00:03:43.560> surface

00:03:44.119 --> 00:03:44.129 
that this this text object is a surface

00:03:44.129 --> 00:03:48.280 
that this this text object is a surface
and<00:03:44.370> it's<00:03:45.030> a<00:03:45.239> poly<00:03:45.750> planar<00:03:46.260> projection<00:03:46.739> and

00:03:48.280 --> 00:03:48.290 
and it's a poly planar projection and

00:03:48.290 --> 00:03:51.979 
and it's a poly planar projection and
here's<00:03:49.290> the<00:03:49.470> surface<00:03:49.859> shape<00:03:50.159> so<00:03:50.970> this<00:03:51.720> gives

00:03:51.979 --> 00:03:51.989 
here's the surface shape so this gives

00:03:51.989 --> 00:03:55.280 
here's the surface shape so this gives
us<00:03:52.169> the<00:03:52.560> the<00:03:52.799> various<00:03:53.220> attributes<00:03:53.549> of<00:03:54.419> of<00:03:54.720> this

on the bevel + or you're going to notice
is<00:04:23.010> you<00:04:23.400> can<00:04:23.610> now<00:04:24.090> start<00:04:24.479> to<00:04:24.719> change

00:04:25.730 --> 00:04:25.740 
is you can now start to change

is you can now start to change
changed<00:04:26.009> various<00:04:26.550> attributes<00:04:26.789> about<00:04:27.449> the

00:04:27.620 --> 00:04:27.630 
changed various attributes about the

00:04:27.630 --> 00:04:29.450 
changed various attributes about the
bevel<00:04:27.990> with<00:04:28.199> the<00:04:28.289> width<00:04:28.530> and<00:04:28.889> the<00:04:28.949> depth<00:04:29.220> and

the extrusion and different things like
that<00:04:32.250> so<00:04:32.780> let<00:04:33.780> us<00:04:33.960> click<00:04:34.680> on<00:04:34.740> our<00:04:35.310> tracking

00:04:36.290 --> 00:04:36.300 
that so let us click on our tracking

00:04:36.300 --> 00:04:38.629 
that so let us click on our tracking
tool<00:04:36.660> let's<00:04:37.229> rotate<00:04:37.590> it<00:04:37.830> around<00:04:38.069> a<00:04:38.370> little<00:04:38.490> bit

00:04:38.629 --> 00:04:38.639 
tool let's rotate it around a little bit

00:04:38.639 --> 00:04:41.089 
tool let's rotate it around a little bit
I'm<00:04:39.630> going<00:04:39.780> to<00:04:39.840> zoom<00:04:40.229> in<00:04:40.410> a<00:04:40.470> little<00:04:40.680> bit<00:04:40.919> by

00:04:41.089 --> 00:04:41.099 
I'm going to zoom in a little bit by

00:04:41.099 --> 00:04:43.999 
I'm going to zoom in a little bit by
scrolling<00:04:41.699> and<00:04:42.020> get<00:04:43.020> kind<00:04:43.319> of<00:04:43.440> in<00:04:43.590> there<00:04:43.800> and

00:04:43.999 --> 00:04:44.009 
scrolling and get kind of in there and

00:04:44.009 --> 00:04:46.999 
scrolling and get kind of in there and
take<00:04:44.190> a<00:04:44.220> look<00:04:44.340> at<00:04:44.669> what<00:04:45.240> it<00:04:45.360> looks<00:04:45.389> like<00:04:45.810> so<00:04:46.590> in

00:04:46.999 --> 00:04:47.009 
take a look at what it looks like so in

00:04:47.009 --> 00:04:48.950 
take a look at what it looks like so in
this<00:04:47.520> case<00:04:47.819> if<00:04:48.000> we<00:04:48.120> want<00:04:48.330> to<00:04:48.389> just<00:04:48.599> play<00:04:48.750> around

00:04:48.950 --> 00:04:48.960 
this case if we want to just play around

00:04:48.960 --> 00:04:51.499 
this case if we want to just play around
with<00:04:49.169> the<00:04:49.259> bevel<00:04:49.560> width<00:04:49.889> go<00:04:50.849> ahead<00:04:51.150> and<00:04:51.330> just

00:04:51.499 --> 00:04:51.509 
with the bevel width go ahead and just

00:04:51.509 --> 00:04:54.200 
with the bevel width go ahead and just
sort<00:04:51.720> of<00:04:51.810> stretch<00:04:52.110> that<00:04:52.380> out<00:04:52.440> or<00:04:53.039> stretch<00:04:53.940> that

00:04:54.200 --> 00:04:54.210 
sort of stretch that out or stretch that

00:04:54.210 --> 00:04:56.570 
sort of stretch that out or stretch that
down<00:04:54.539> and<00:04:54.990> you<00:04:55.530> can<00:04:55.680> see<00:04:55.860> where<00:04:56.039> it<00:04:56.130> starts<00:04:56.490> to

00:04:56.570 --> 00:04:56.580 
down and you can see where it starts to

00:04:56.580 --> 00:04:59.300 
down and you can see where it starts to
move<00:04:56.940> in<00:04:57.180> on<00:04:57.330> itself<00:04:57.750> or<00:04:58.080> move<00:04:58.289> out<00:04:58.530> on<00:04:58.919> itself

00:04:59.300 --> 00:04:59.310 
move in on itself or move out on itself

00:04:59.310 --> 00:05:02.089 
move in on itself or move out on itself
and<00:04:59.610> that<00:05:00.360> sort<00:05:00.870> of<00:05:00.960> gives<00:05:01.199> us<00:05:01.440> some<00:05:01.650> control

00:05:02.089 --> 00:05:02.099 
and that sort of gives us some control

00:05:02.099 --> 00:05:04.370 
and that sort of gives us some control
over<00:05:02.130> that<00:05:02.699> portion<00:05:03.270> of<00:05:03.539> the<00:05:03.659> bevel<00:05:03.870> right<00:05:04.020> now

00:05:04.370 --> 00:05:04.380 
over that portion of the bevel right now

00:05:04.380 --> 00:05:06.770 
over that portion of the bevel right now
it's<00:05:04.590> in<00:05:04.740> the<00:05:04.830> negative<00:05:05.419> so<00:05:06.419> you'll<00:05:06.569> notice

00:05:06.770 --> 00:05:06.780 
it's in the negative so you'll notice

00:05:06.780 --> 00:05:09.080 
it's in the negative so you'll notice
that<00:05:06.900> it's<00:05:07.139> moving<00:05:07.470> to<00:05:07.590> the<00:05:07.680> inside<00:05:07.979> of<00:05:08.639> that

00:05:09.080 --> 00:05:09.090 
that it's moving to the inside of that

00:05:09.090 --> 00:05:11.899 
that it's moving to the inside of that
text<00:05:09.780> and<00:05:09.930> as<00:05:10.080> I<00:05:10.199> bring<00:05:10.259> it<00:05:10.590> out<00:05:10.770> now<00:05:11.699> it's

00:05:11.899 --> 00:05:11.909 
text and as I bring it out now it's

00:05:11.909 --> 00:05:14.210 
text and as I bring it out now it's
moving<00:05:12.180> a<00:05:12.330> little<00:05:12.419> bit<00:05:12.569> to<00:05:12.780> the<00:05:12.900> outside<00:05:13.380> so

00:05:14.210 --> 00:05:14.220 
moving a little bit to the outside so

00:05:14.220 --> 00:05:17.629 
moving a little bit to the outside so
that's<00:05:14.849> our<00:05:15.030> our<00:05:15.270> bevel<00:05:15.659> width<00:05:16.050> now<00:05:16.949> if<00:05:17.520> you

00:05:17.629 --> 00:05:17.639 
that's our our bevel width now if you

00:05:17.639 --> 00:05:19.040 
that's our our bevel width now if you
want<00:05:17.789> to<00:05:17.849> play<00:05:17.970> and<00:05:18.449> play<00:05:18.539> around<00:05:18.720> with<00:05:18.930> the

00:05:19.040 --> 00:05:19.050 
want to play and play around with the

00:05:19.050 --> 00:05:21.409 
want to play and play around with the
bevel<00:05:19.259> depth<00:05:19.759> let's<00:05:20.759> just<00:05:21.000> go<00:05:21.180> ahead<00:05:21.300> and

00:05:21.409 --> 00:05:21.419 
bevel depth let's just go ahead and

00:05:21.419 --> 00:05:23.719 
bevel depth let's just go ahead and
click<00:05:21.690> that<00:05:21.960> and<00:05:22.229> I'll<00:05:22.949> bring<00:05:23.220> that<00:05:23.430> all<00:05:23.699> the

00:05:23.719 --> 00:05:23.729 
click that and I'll bring that all the

00:05:23.729 --> 00:05:26.120 
click that and I'll bring that all the
way<00:05:23.849> out<00:05:23.940> and<00:05:24.360> you<00:05:24.449> can<00:05:24.690> see<00:05:24.960> where<00:05:25.169> it<00:05:25.740> sort<00:05:26.069> of

00:05:26.120 --> 00:05:26.130 
way out and you can see where it sort of

00:05:26.130 --> 00:05:29.930 
way out and you can see where it sort of
gives<00:05:26.340> it<00:05:26.639> a<00:05:26.819> lot<00:05:27.240> more<00:05:27.449> depth<00:05:27.889> so<00:05:28.889> that<00:05:29.550> kind

00:05:29.930 --> 00:05:29.940 
gives it a lot more depth so that kind

00:05:29.940 --> 00:05:32.659 
gives it a lot more depth so that kind
of<00:05:30.030> is<00:05:30.180> how<00:05:30.360> that<00:05:30.419> works<00:05:31.130> so<00:05:32.130> you<00:05:32.219> can<00:05:32.430> play

00:05:32.659 --> 00:05:32.669 
of is how that works so you can play

00:05:32.669 --> 00:05:34.510 
of is how that works so you can play
around<00:05:32.820> with<00:05:33.150> various<00:05:33.449> different<00:05:33.900> options

00:05:34.510 --> 00:05:34.520 
around with various different options

00:05:34.520 --> 00:05:37.129 
around with various different options
there's<00:05:35.520> all<00:05:35.909> sorts<00:05:36.389> of<00:05:36.449> different<00:05:36.509> styles

00:05:37.129 --> 00:05:37.139

there's all sorts of different styles
and<00:05:37.620> curves<00:05:38.550> that<00:05:38.789> you<00:05:38.849> can<00:05:39.150> you<00:05:39.570> can<00:05:40.610> assign

00:05:41.600 --> 00:05:41.610 
and curves that you can you can assign

00:05:41.610 --> 00:05:44.240 
and curves that you can you can assign
to<00:05:41.849> the<00:05:42.060> text<00:05:42.780> and<00:05:42.990> you<00:05:43.530> can<00:05:43.680> work<00:05:43.830> with<00:05:43.860> it<00:05:44.159> in

00:05:44.240 --> 00:05:44.250 
to the text and you can work with it in

00:05:44.250 --> 00:05:45.200 
to the text and you can work with it in
various<00:05:44.610> different<00:05:44.820> ways

00:05:57.920 --> 00:05:57.930 
us that it's going straight out if we

00:05:57.930 --> 00:05:59.420 
us that it's going straight out if we
want<00:05:58.110> to<00:05:58.169> look<00:05:58.349> at<00:05:58.530> what<00:05:58.680> it<00:05:58.800> looks<00:05:58.830> like<00:05:59.190> going

want to look at what it looks like going
straight<00:05:59.880> in<00:06:00.120> we<00:06:00.900> can<00:06:01.050> see<00:06:01.469> that's<00:06:01.770> what<00:06:02.009> they

00:06:02.149 --> 00:06:02.159 
straight in we can see that's what they

00:06:02.159 --> 00:06:02.990 
straight in we can see that's what they
look<00:06:02.400> like

00:06:02.990 --> 00:06:03.000 
look like

00:06:03.000 --> 00:06:06.219 
look like
convex<00:06:03.659> out<00:06:03.960> that<00:06:04.440> gives<00:06:05.159> us<00:06:05.310> another<00:06:05.550> option

00:06:06.219 --> 00:06:06.229 
convex out that gives us another option

00:06:06.229 --> 00:06:10.040 
convex out that gives us another option
convex<00:06:07.229> in<00:06:07.500> that's<00:06:07.889> another<00:06:08.190> option<00:06:09.050> concave

00:06:10.040 --> 00:06:10.050 
convex in that's another option concave

00:06:10.050 --> 00:06:13.219 
convex in that's another option concave
out<00:06:10.440> and<00:06:10.979> that<00:06:11.940> you<00:06:12.270> can<00:06:12.449> see<00:06:12.659> where<00:06:12.840> it<00:06:12.960> has<00:06:13.199> a

00:06:13.219 --> 00:06:13.229 
out and that you can see where it has a

00:06:13.229 --> 00:06:15.589 
out and that you can see where it has a
little<00:06:13.440> bit<00:06:13.650> of<00:06:13.770> a<00:06:13.830> concavity<00:06:14.370> from<00:06:15.030> the<00:06:15.240> face
