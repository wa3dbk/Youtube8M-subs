7<00:01:31.860> watts<00:01:31.979> of<00:01:32.220> power<00:01:32.479> so<00:01:33.479> they<00:01:33.840> really<00:01:34.560> got<00:01:34.770> it<00:01:34.950> i

00:01:35.060 --> 00:01:35.070 
7 watts of power so they really got it i

00:01:35.070 --> 00:01:36.950 
7 watts of power so they really got it i
would<00:01:35.400> say<00:01:35.490> that<00:01:35.520> 10<00:01:35.880> is<00:01:36.030> probably<00:01:36.329> a<00:01:36.420> maximum

00:01:36.950 --> 00:01:36.960 
would say that 10 is probably a maximum

00:01:36.960 --> 00:01:38.420 
would say that 10 is probably a maximum
just<00:01:37.170> to<00:01:37.259> account<00:01:37.500> for<00:01:37.530> variability<00:01:38.040> in<00:01:38.340> each

00:01:38.420 --> 00:01:38.430
