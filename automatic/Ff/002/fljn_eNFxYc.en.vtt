00:00:09.879 --> 00:00:16.070
 how about friends of youtube and 

00:00:12.770 --> 00:00:18.289
 vettel companions on this occasion 

00:00:16.070 --> 00:00:22.039
 let's record a game let's make a 

00:00:18.289 --> 00:00:25.480
 tutorial that asked us to eduardo a 

00:00:22.039 --> 00:00:25.480
 very simple tutorial that 

00:00:25.800 --> 00:00:33.690
 Well, I did not think it was necessary, but good 

00:00:30.539 --> 00:00:37.100
 it was a request from this page is 

00:00:33.690 --> 00:00:40.820
 this to register 

00:00:37.100 --> 00:00:43.800
 our our burdens our trips 

00:00:40.820 --> 00:00:48.390
 of the virtual company 

00:00:43.800 --> 00:00:51.020
 because this to enter this page 

00:00:48.390 --> 00:00:53.790
 he has to register us eduardo 

00:00:51.020 --> 00:00:58.079
 we need a number asking for a number 

00:00:53.790 --> 00:00:59.760
 account and a password then this 

00:00:58.079 --> 00:01:01.800
 I already have my new account in 

00:00:59.760 --> 00:01:03.640
 password if you do not have it you have to 

00:01:01.800 --> 00:01:06.640
 ask for it eduardo 

00:01:03.640 --> 00:01:08.350
 this as you see here we are already 4 

00:01:06.640 --> 00:01:12.880
 Registered 

00:01:08.350 --> 00:01:16.509
 andrÃ©s bonilla eduardo and me then 

00:01:12.880 --> 00:01:18.580
 this is the general interface of the 

00:01:16.509 --> 00:01:22.420
 page 

00:01:18.580 --> 00:01:25.900
 and here is the name of the company 

00:01:22.420 --> 00:01:28.750
 then roughly to require of 

00:01:25.900 --> 00:01:34.920
 features what I understood 

00:01:28.750 --> 00:01:34.920
 is that we are going to record our trips 

00:01:35.030 --> 00:01:42.560
 in this place that forms forms or good 

00:01:40.810 --> 00:01:45.770
 formats 

00:01:42.560 --> 00:01:48.340
 there are two formats that is the blog and a 

00:01:45.770 --> 00:01:48.340
 report 

00:01:48.530 --> 00:01:55.070
 so let's go here to blog and 

00:01:51.530 --> 00:01:57.430
 as he asks us in this case in this case I 

00:01:55.070 --> 00:01:57.430
 I have 

00:01:57.520 --> 00:02:04.840
 translated then this here tells us 

00:02:02.079 --> 00:02:07.750
 binnacle logbook asks us a date 

00:02:04.840 --> 00:02:12.340
 and an exit time in this I'm not 

00:02:07.750 --> 00:02:16.599
 very sure of what the date is 

00:02:12.340 --> 00:02:18.830
 then this this sign I do not know well that 

00:02:16.599 --> 00:02:23.690
 tell the date of him 

00:02:18.830 --> 00:02:26.360
 of the game or the actual date 

00:02:23.690 --> 00:02:29.930
 that the game date but I do not know well 

00:02:26.360 --> 00:02:33.100
 this yes I do not know then the now yes yes it is 

00:02:29.930 --> 00:02:35.590
 possible in the game tells us the time 

00:02:33.100 --> 00:02:38.260
 here he also asks us for the destiny that is 

00:02:35.590 --> 00:02:40.480
 basically the same thing but at the time of 

00:02:38.260 --> 00:02:41.720
 the time of arrival date at 

00:02:40.480 --> 00:02:45.230
 destination 

00:02:41.720 --> 00:02:48.200
 here gives us the possible options of the 

00:02:45.230 --> 00:02:52.480
 places from where we left are all 

00:02:48.200 --> 00:02:55.420
 the 50s also for the expansion 

00:02:52.480 --> 00:02:57.819
 and I think yes yes yes yes yes it has the 

00:02:55.420 --> 00:03:02.260
 fraction then be here we choose the 

00:02:57.819 --> 00:03:05.140
 place of departure and here the destination is 

00:03:02.260 --> 00:03:08.080
 crisis in kilometers this are the 

00:03:05.140 --> 00:03:10.379
 kilometers traveled at the end of 

00:03:08.080 --> 00:03:10.379
 work 

00:03:11.130 --> 00:03:18.610
 these are the tonnage that we got 

00:03:15.390 --> 00:03:23.950
 carry what we chose 

00:03:18.610 --> 00:03:28.740
 this is the fuel that was used in 

00:03:23.950 --> 00:03:32.660
 liters the page does not put us in liters 

00:03:28.740 --> 00:03:36.880
 and to keep all this is necessary 

00:03:32.660 --> 00:03:41.350
 choose an image upload an image 

00:03:36.880 --> 00:03:43.480
 then this is most advisable as 

00:03:41.350 --> 00:03:45.220
 says here that it's a test image of 

00:03:43.480 --> 00:03:47.800
 proof of the work that is done 

00:03:45.220 --> 00:03:52.080
 work then the most advisable thing would be 

00:03:47.800 --> 00:03:56.710
 upload an image of at the end of the 

00:03:52.080 --> 00:03:59.800
 work and you have to check this everything 

00:03:56.710 --> 00:04:02.200
 that what he tells us not in all 

00:03:59.800 --> 00:04:04.629
 two general data 

00:04:02.200 --> 00:04:07.360
 and the note if you want to add a note 

00:04:04.629 --> 00:04:11.560
 but it is not necessary 

00:04:07.360 --> 00:04:14.550
 and we will put it in, yes, I hope that 

00:04:11.560 --> 00:04:17.530
 understand this they need a file 

00:04:14.550 --> 00:04:19.900
 it is very necessary to be able to keep them 

00:04:17.530 --> 00:04:22.750
 If you are not going to leave us to keep good 

00:04:19.900 --> 00:04:24.760
 We are going to the other format, which is the 

00:04:22.750 --> 00:04:27.400
 report this report serves us 

00:04:24.760 --> 00:04:31.700
 basically for as its name says 

00:04:27.400 --> 00:04:33.380
 report or report something 

00:04:31.700 --> 00:04:36.870
 this 

00:04:33.380 --> 00:04:40.530
 and composed in an accident 

00:04:36.870 --> 00:04:43.860
 then he asks us for the same data 

00:04:40.530 --> 00:04:47.950
 date and time and a location where 

00:04:43.860 --> 00:04:51.510
 the mishap occurred or 

00:04:47.950 --> 00:04:54.010
 or X thing thing then here it is necessary 

00:04:51.510 --> 00:04:57.160
 all the data here we are going to add a 

00:04:54.010 --> 00:04:59.670
 note to be able to save in this case I 

00:04:57.160 --> 00:05:03.550
 I put some false data for 

00:04:59.670 --> 00:05:08.480
 check it then already having already well 

00:05:03.550 --> 00:05:12.090
 already the guardian can have this 

00:05:08.480 --> 00:05:14.760
 let's see what was effectively saved 

00:05:12.090 --> 00:05:16.740
 like his profile directly where 

00:05:14.760 --> 00:05:20.610
 is your nick in this case we are 

00:05:16.740 --> 00:05:23.400
 using the destination knicks because 

00:05:20.610 --> 00:05:25.190
 we are registered like this and we are going to go to 

00:05:23.400 --> 00:05:29.440
 our profile 

00:05:25.190 --> 00:05:29.440
 or is it the same as here 

00:05:29.889 --> 00:05:34.020
 and here is already saved the one that I made 

00:05:32.080 --> 00:05:36.720
 test 

00:05:34.020 --> 00:05:38.860
 If it is a test, it is not real, then 

00:05:36.720 --> 00:05:42.250
 here is already 

00:05:38.860 --> 00:05:44.469
 I put some data to prove what 

00:05:42.250 --> 00:05:48.719
 it was about and an image obviously the 

00:05:44.469 --> 00:05:51.330
 image is the same as the one I had first 

00:05:48.719 --> 00:05:54.090
 then this one 

00:05:51.330 --> 00:05:56.970
 and it 's basically for this it serves us 

00:05:54.090 --> 00:05:59.860
 the page to register our 

00:05:56.970 --> 00:06:04.539
 trips to the company 

00:05:59.860 --> 00:06:06.669
 and good as I told you this sign 

00:06:04.539 --> 00:06:08.229
 They have your number and your password, there are 

00:06:06.669 --> 00:06:10.449
 that ask for it eduardo de verde is going to 

00:06:08.229 --> 00:06:13.500
 be working on this because he 

00:06:10.449 --> 00:06:15.840
 you have to register with the company 

00:06:13.500 --> 00:06:20.540
 I hope you have understood and any 

00:06:15.840 --> 00:06:20.540
 clarification directly with the bard
