00:00:11.299 --> 00:00:11.309 
takes a while to start up if it even

00:00:11.309 --> 00:00:13.730 
takes a while to start up if it even
yeah<00:00:11.849> the<00:00:12.540> first<00:00:12.750> time<00:00:12.870> it<00:00:13.019> always<00:00:13.139> starts<00:00:13.590> up

00:00:13.730 --> 00:00:13.740

I'm<00:00:48.300> not<00:00:48.510> sure<00:00:48.750> like<00:00:49.020> I<00:00:49.170> said<00:00:49.440> but<00:00:49.710> when<00:00:50.070> I<00:00:50.100> got

00:00:50.270 --> 00:00:50.280 
I'm not sure like I said but when I got

00:00:50.280 --> 00:00:52.970 
I'm not sure like I said but when I got
on<00:00:50.430> the<00:00:50.520> gas<00:00:50.670> a<00:00:50.730> little<00:00:50.969> bit<00:00:51.649> that's<00:00:52.649> not<00:00:52.860> very

00:00:52.970 --> 00:00:52.980 
on the gas a little bit that's not very

00:00:52.980 --> 00:00:54.830 
on the gas a little bit that's not very
much<00:00:53.160> gas<00:00:53.489> but<00:00:53.789> it's<00:00:53.940> still<00:00:54.120> sluggish<00:00:54.570> I<00:00:54.719> can

00:00:54.830 --> 00:00:54.840 
much gas but it's still sluggish I can

00:00:54.840 --> 00:01:16.580 
much gas but it's still sluggish I can
definitely<00:00:54.989> feel<00:00:55.230> it<00:01:06.619> if<00:01:07.619> I<00:01:07.770> do<00:01:07.830> a<00:01:07.950> slower

00:01:16.580 --> 00:01:16.590 

00:01:16.590 --> 00:01:18.810

00:01:20.900 --> 00:01:20.910 
issue I don't know what that could be

00:01:20.910 --> 00:01:23.130 
issue I don't know what that could be
I'm<00:01:21.910> gonna<00:01:22.090> turn<00:01:22.270> it<00:01:22.420> off<00:01:22.510> in<00:01:22.660> a<00:01:22.720> second<00:01:23.080> and

00:01:23.130 --> 00:01:23.140 
I'm gonna turn it off in a second and

00:01:23.140 --> 00:01:25.500 
I'm gonna turn it off in a second and
try<00:01:23.410> and<00:01:23.590> start<00:01:23.860> it<00:01:24.010> back<00:01:24.160> up<00:01:24.220> yo<00:01:24.850> we'll<00:01:25.360> see

00:01:25.500 --> 00:01:25.510 
try and start it back up yo we'll see

00:01:25.510 --> 00:01:27.570 
try and start it back up yo we'll see
how<00:01:25.630> that<00:01:25.810> goes<00:01:26.020> but<00:01:26.080> just<00:01:26.650> to<00:01:26.710> show<00:01:26.890> you<00:01:26.920> that

00:01:27.570 --> 00:01:27.580 
how that goes but just to show you that

00:01:27.580 --> 00:01:29.430 
how that goes but just to show you that
was<00:01:27.700> very<00:01:28.030> slowly<00:01:28.510> and<00:01:28.720> it<00:01:28.810> still<00:01:29.080> limits

00:01:29.430 --> 00:01:29.440 
was very slowly and it still limits

00:01:29.440 --> 00:01:32.010 
was very slowly and it still limits
itself<00:01:29.710> right<00:01:29.920> at<00:01:30.070> about<00:01:30.370> in<00:01:30.880> after<00:01:31.390> 3,000

00:01:32.010 --> 00:01:32.020 
itself right at about in after 3,000

00:01:32.020 --> 00:01:34.890 
itself right at about in after 3,000
just<00:01:32.200> a<00:01:32.260> little<00:01:32.470> bit<00:01:32.590> over<00:01:32.680> on<00:01:32.890> 3,000<00:01:33.610> if<00:01:34.570> I<00:01:34.780> go

00:01:34.890 --> 00:01:34.900 
just a little bit over on 3,000 if I go

00:01:34.900 --> 00:01:36.510 
just a little bit over on 3,000 if I go
quickly<00:01:35.230> though<00:01:35.470> basically<00:01:35.740> just<00:01:36.190> give<00:01:36.370> it<00:01:36.460> a

00:01:36.510 --> 00:01:36.520 
quickly though basically just give it a

00:01:36.520 --> 00:01:40.500 
quickly though basically just give it a
quick<00:01:36.730> punch<00:01:38.520> not<00:01:39.520> only<00:01:39.760> is<00:01:39.850> it<00:01:39.910> extremely

00:01:40.500 --> 00:01:40.510 
quick punch not only is it extremely

00:01:40.510 --> 00:01:50.190 
quick punch not only is it extremely
sluggish<00:01:48.330> engine<00:01:49.330> sound<00:01:49.570> like<00:01:49.780> it<00:01:49.930> was<00:01:50.020> gonna

00:01:50.190 --> 00:01:50.200 
sluggish engine sound like it was gonna

00:01:50.200 --> 00:01:52.080 
sluggish engine sound like it was gonna
die<00:01:50.500> I<00:01:50.830> don't<00:01:51.010> know<00:01:51.100> what<00:01:51.280> it<00:01:51.369> is<00:01:51.520> as<00:01:51.850> a<00:01:51.880> new

feel filter new battery it has new oil I

00:01:56.229 --> 00:02:00.150 
feel filter new battery it has new oil I
don't<00:01:57.220> know<00:01:57.280> I've<00:01:58.229> tried<00:01:59.229> a<00:01:59.290> lot<00:01:59.530> of<00:01:59.650> stuff<00:01:59.920> I

don't know I've tried a lot of stuff I

00:02:00.160 --> 00:02:05.120 
don't know I've tried a lot of stuff I
clean<00:02:00.520> the<00:02:00.670> throttle<00:02:01.060> body<00:02:01.150> out<00:02:01.390> very<00:02:01.750> well<00:02:01.869> I

00:02:05.120 --> 00:02:05.130 

00:02:05.130 --> 00:02:07.380
