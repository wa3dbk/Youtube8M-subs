00:01:01.320 --> 00:01:01.330 

00:01:01.330 --> 00:01:03.270 

the<00:01:01.780> actual<00:01:02.170> instrument<00:01:02.440> stuff<00:01:02.860> I<00:01:03.040> thought

00:01:03.270 --> 00:01:03.280 
the actual instrument stuff I thought

00:01:03.280 --> 00:01:04.830 
the actual instrument stuff I thought
I'd<00:01:03.370> demonstrate<00:01:03.550> it<00:01:04.059> so<00:01:04.239> you<00:01:04.330> can<00:01:04.510> hear<00:01:04.809> it

00:01:04.830 --> 00:01:04.840 
I'd demonstrate it so you can hear it

00:01:04.840 --> 00:01:07.650 
I'd demonstrate it so you can hear it
within<00:01:05.470> with<00:01:06.010> that<00:01:06.160> upgraded<00:01:06.790> strings<00:01:07.120> which

00:01:07.650 --> 00:01:07.660 
within with that upgraded strings which

00:01:07.660 --> 00:01:44.780 
within with that upgraded strings which
is<00:01:07.840> a<00:01:07.870> possible<00:01:08.320> upgrade<00:01:08.830> when<00:01:09.430> you're

00:01:44.780 --> 00:01:44.790 

00:01:44.790 --> 00:01:48.300 

and<00:01:45.790> that's<00:01:46.030> the<00:01:46.180> RSA<00:01:46.690> with<00:01:46.930> our<00:01:47.650> normal<00:01:48.100> steel

00:01:48.300 --> 00:01:48.310 
and that's the RSA with our normal steel

00:01:48.310 --> 00:01:52.140 
and that's the RSA with our normal steel
strings<00:01:49.979> so<00:01:50.979> we<00:01:51.100> have<00:01:51.220> the<00:01:51.310> same<00:01:51.490> area<00:01:51.880> same

00:01:52.140 --> 00:01:52.150 
strings so we have the same area same

00:01:52.150 --> 00:01:54.359 
strings so we have the same area same
instrument<00:01:52.869> here<00:01:53.050> but<00:01:53.440> now<00:01:53.680> huh<00:01:53.979> credit<00:01:54.280> the

00:01:54.359 --> 00:01:54.369 
instrument here but now huh credit the

00:01:54.369 --> 00:01:56.430 
instrument here but now huh credit the
strings<00:01:54.670> in<00:01:55.000> this<00:01:55.390> instance<00:01:55.869> we've<00:01:56.050> used<00:01:56.229> for

00:01:56.430 --> 00:01:56.440 
strings in this instance we've used for

00:01:56.440 --> 00:01:58.469 
strings in this instance we've used for

00:01:58.469 --> 00:01:58.479 
a stroke tonic arbiters synthetic or

00:01:58.479 --> 00:02:01.380 
a stroke tonic arbiters synthetic or
string<00:01:58.930> which<00:01:59.530> should<00:01:59.830> feel<00:02:00.280> soft<00:02:01.030> under<00:02:01.270> the
