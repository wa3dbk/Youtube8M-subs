00:00:00.340 --> 00:00:03.759 

so<00:00:01.340> how<00:00:01.520> do<00:00:01.580> slot<00:00:02.149> machines<00:00:02.570> work<00:00:02.989> here<00:00:03.649> we've

00:00:03.759 --> 00:00:03.769 
so how do slot machines work here we've

00:00:03.769 --> 00:00:07.780 
so how do slot machines work here we've
got<00:00:03.889> the<00:00:04.540> workings<00:00:05.540> now<00:00:06.259> stripped<00:00:06.709> out<00:00:06.950> of<00:00:07.189> the

00:00:07.780 --> 00:00:07.790 
got the workings now stripped out of the

00:00:07.790 --> 00:00:10.419 
got the workings now stripped out of the
casing<00:00:08.269> of<00:00:08.420> a<00:00:09.019> common<00:00:09.410> slot<00:00:09.830> machine<00:00:10.190> there

00:00:10.419 --> 00:00:10.429 
casing of a common slot machine there

00:00:10.429 --> 00:00:12.640 
casing of a common slot machine there
most<00:00:10.639> slot<00:00:10.849> machines<00:00:11.179> work<00:00:11.450> the<00:00:11.660> same<00:00:11.929> doesn't

00:00:12.640 --> 00:00:12.650 
most slot machines work the same doesn't

00:00:12.650 --> 00:00:14.740 
most slot machines work the same doesn't
matter<00:00:12.769> whether<00:00:12.950> it's<00:00:13.160> a<00:00:13.280> Mills<00:00:13.549> and<00:00:14.000> Sega<00:00:14.540> a

00:00:14.740 --> 00:00:14.750 
matter whether it's a Mills and Sega a

00:00:14.750 --> 00:00:18.210 
matter whether it's a Mills and Sega a
Jennings<00:00:16.029> they<00:00:17.029> all<00:00:17.270> have<00:00:17.689> the<00:00:17.900> same

00:00:18.210 --> 00:00:18.220 
Jennings they all have the same

00:00:18.220 --> 00:00:20.740 
Jennings they all have the same
functionality<00:00:19.220> and<00:00:19.760> that<00:00:19.939> is<00:00:20.090> to<00:00:20.240> accept<00:00:20.630> a

00:00:20.740 --> 00:00:20.750 
functionality and that is to accept a

00:00:20.750 --> 00:00:24.250 
functionality and that is to accept a
coin<00:00:20.960> spin<00:00:21.500> some<00:00:21.740> rules<00:00:21.980> and<00:00:22.279> payout<00:00:23.140> so<00:00:24.140> we're

00:00:24.250 --> 00:00:24.260 
coin spin some rules and payout so we're

00:00:24.260 --> 00:00:27.040 
coin spin some rules and payout so we're
going<00:00:24.380> to<00:00:24.470> take<00:00:24.619> a<00:00:24.650> look<00:00:24.949> at<00:00:25.160> the<00:00:25.869> operation<00:00:26.869> of

00:00:27.040 --> 00:00:27.050 
going to take a look at the operation of

00:00:27.050 --> 00:00:29.499 
going to take a look at the operation of
this<00:00:27.560> mechanical<00:00:27.949> marvel<00:00:28.670> and<00:00:28.880> how<00:00:29.359> it

00:00:29.499 --> 00:00:29.509 
this mechanical marvel and how it

00:00:29.509 --> 00:00:31.330 
this mechanical marvel and how it
actually<00:00:29.630> works<00:00:30.199> from<00:00:30.619> the<00:00:30.740> moment<00:00:31.099> you<00:00:31.160> put<00:00:31.279> a

00:00:31.330 --> 00:00:31.340 
actually works from the moment you put a

00:00:31.340 --> 00:00:35.620 
actually works from the moment you put a
coin<00:00:31.640> in<00:00:31.670> to<00:00:32.450> the<00:00:32.570> moment<00:00:32.900> it<00:00:33.020> pays<00:00:33.260> out<00:00:34.630> the

00:00:35.620 --> 00:00:35.630 
coin in to the moment it pays out the

00:00:35.630 --> 00:00:39.630 
coin in to the moment it pays out the
main<00:00:35.810> connecting<00:00:36.320> arm<00:00:36.530> along<00:00:37.190> the<00:00:37.340> back<00:00:37.550> here

00:00:39.630 --> 00:00:39.640 

00:00:39.640 --> 00:00:43.240 

pushes<00:00:40.640> the<00:00:41.090> clock<00:00:41.420> forward<00:00:42.110> so<00:00:42.950> when<00:00:43.130> you

00:00:43.240 --> 00:00:43.250 
pushes the clock forward so when you

00:00:43.250 --> 00:00:46.150 
pushes the clock forward so when you
pull<00:00:43.490> the<00:00:43.670> arm<00:00:43.820> this<00:00:44.390> twists<00:00:44.810> and<00:00:45.140> pushes<00:00:45.980> the

00:00:46.150 --> 00:00:46.160 
pull the arm this twists and pushes the

00:00:46.160 --> 00:00:50.410 
pull the arm this twists and pushes the
clock<00:00:46.430> forward<00:00:46.910> using<00:00:47.150> this<00:00:47.630> arm<00:00:47.930> here<00:00:49.420> which

00:00:50.410 --> 00:00:50.420 
clock forward using this arm here which

00:00:50.420 --> 00:01:05.920 
clock forward using this arm here which
in<00:00:50.600> turn<00:00:50.870> pushes<00:00:51.380> this<00:00:52.390> clock<00:01:04.780> may<00:01:05.780> have

00:01:05.920 --> 00:01:05.930 
in turn pushes this clock may have

00:01:05.930 --> 00:01:08.560 
in turn pushes this clock may have
notice<00:01:06.350> up<00:01:06.590> when<00:01:07.370> this<00:01:07.550> pushed<00:01:07.910> the<00:01:08.180> clock

00:01:08.560 --> 00:01:08.570 
notice up when this pushed the clock

00:01:08.570 --> 00:01:10.870 
notice up when this pushed the clock
forward<00:01:09.440> to<00:01:09.770> wind<00:01:10.040> it<00:01:10.250> out<00:01:10.370> that<00:01:10.580> massive

00:01:10.870 --> 00:01:10.880 
forward to wind it out that massive

00:01:10.880 --> 00:01:14.230 
forward to wind it out that massive
wind-up<00:01:11.450> session<00:01:12.110> now<00:01:12.980> we<00:01:13.040> can<00:01:13.400> look<00:01:13.970> at<00:01:14.120> what

00:01:14.230 --> 00:01:14.240 
wind-up session now we can look at what

00:01:14.240 --> 00:01:16.450 
wind-up session now we can look at what
else<00:01:14.360> happens<00:01:14.990> at<00:01:15.260> the<00:01:15.410> same<00:01:15.710> time<00:01:16.130> that<00:01:16.430> that

00:01:16.450 --> 00:01:16.460 
else happens at the same time that that

00:01:16.460 --> 00:01:19.030 
else happens at the same time that that
gets<00:01:16.850> pushed<00:01:17.120> forward<00:01:17.720> several<00:01:18.530> other<00:01:18.770> things

00:01:19.030 --> 00:01:19.040 
gets pushed forward several other things

00:01:19.040 --> 00:01:22.750 
gets pushed forward several other things
happen<00:01:19.520> the<00:01:20.120> vertical<00:01:20.900> payout<00:01:21.530> fingers<00:01:22.130> at

00:01:22.750 --> 00:01:22.760 
happen the vertical payout fingers at

00:01:22.760 --> 00:01:24.910 
happen the vertical payout fingers at
the<00:01:22.970> top<00:01:23.270> here<00:01:23.660> these<00:01:24.200> are<00:01:24.440> the<00:01:24.500> ones<00:01:24.710> are

00:01:24.910 --> 00:01:24.920 
the top here these are the ones are

00:01:24.920 --> 00:01:26.920 
the top here these are the ones are
going<00:01:25.100> to<00:01:25.280> the<00:01:25.400> sides<00:01:25.730> of<00:01:25.910> the<00:01:26.060> reels<00:01:26.360> which

00:01:26.920 --> 00:01:26.930 
going to the sides of the reels which

00:01:26.930 --> 00:01:30.340 
going to the sides of the reels which
have<00:01:27.080> been<00:01:27.230> removed<00:01:28.060> are<00:01:29.060> pulled<00:01:29.450> backwards

00:01:30.340 --> 00:01:30.350 
have been removed are pulled backwards

00:01:30.350 --> 00:01:33.160 
have been removed are pulled backwards
out<00:01:31.250> of<00:01:31.580> the<00:01:31.670> way<00:01:31.850> and<00:01:32.090> make<00:01:32.210> it<00:01:32.360> locked<00:01:32.720> in<00:01:33.020> the

00:01:33.160 --> 00:01:33.170 
out of the way and make it locked in the

00:01:33.170 --> 00:01:45.930 
out of the way and make it locked in the
backward<00:01:33.650> position

00:01:45.930 --> 00:01:45.940 

00:01:45.940 --> 00:01:48.910 

the<00:01:46.940> other<00:01:47.060> thing<00:01:47.270> that<00:01:47.300> happens<00:01:47.870> are<00:01:48.170> these

00:01:48.910 --> 00:01:48.920 
the other thing that happens are these

00:01:48.920 --> 00:01:53.800 
the other thing that happens are these
three<00:01:49.340> breaks<00:01:49.760> as<00:01:50.980> a<00:01:51.980> can<00:01:52.430> move<00:01:52.700> forward

00:01:53.800 --> 00:01:53.810 
three breaks as a can move forward

00:01:53.810 --> 00:01:57.280 
three breaks as a can move forward
it<00:01:54.290> moves<00:01:54.710> these<00:01:55.280> breaks<00:01:55.970> out<00:01:56.390> of<00:01:56.720> the<00:01:56.810> way<00:01:56.960> now

00:01:57.280 --> 00:01:57.290 
it moves these breaks out of the way now

00:01:57.290 --> 00:01:59.320 
it moves these breaks out of the way now
just<00:01:57.560> for<00:01:57.740> clarity<00:01:58.190> we've<00:01:58.460> moved<00:01:58.790> them<00:01:59.000> out<00:01:59.120> of

00:01:59.320 --> 00:01:59.330 
just for clarity we've moved them out of

00:01:59.330 --> 00:02:01.840 
just for clarity we've moved them out of
the<00:01:59.390> way<00:01:59.510> already<00:01:59.870> but<00:02:00.590> remember<00:02:01.070> these<00:02:01.310> three

00:02:01.840 --> 00:02:01.850 
the way already but remember these three

00:02:01.850 --> 00:02:04.469 
the way already but remember these three
breaks<00:02:02.300> are<00:02:02.660> the<00:02:02.780> ones<00:02:03.020> that<00:02:03.290> hold<00:02:03.500> the<00:02:03.800> reels

00:02:04.469 --> 00:02:04.479 
breaks are the ones that hold the reels

00:02:04.479 --> 00:02:09.340 
breaks are the ones that hold the reels
static<00:02:05.740> so<00:02:06.740> as<00:02:07.070> the<00:02:07.340> clock<00:02:07.670> winds<00:02:08.179> up<00:02:08.540> it

00:02:09.340 --> 00:02:09.350 
static so as the clock winds up it

00:02:09.350 --> 00:02:14.290 
static so as the clock winds up it
pushes<00:02:09.920> at<00:02:10.040> time<00:02:10.429> a<00:02:10.460> bar<00:02:11.200> just<00:02:12.200> here<00:02:12.880> and<00:02:13.880> this

00:02:14.290 --> 00:02:14.300 
pushes at time a bar just here and this

00:02:14.300 --> 00:02:41.280 
pushes at time a bar just here and this
pushes<00:02:14.900> the<00:02:15.080> breaks<00:02:15.410> away<00:02:15.860> from<00:02:16.760> the<00:02:17.090> reels

00:02:41.280 --> 00:02:41.290 

00:02:41.290 --> 00:02:44.229 

once<00:02:42.290> the<00:02:42.500> breaks<00:02:42.739> have<00:02:42.980> been<00:02:43.160> moved<00:02:43.430> forward

00:02:44.229 --> 00:02:44.239 
once the breaks have been moved forward

00:02:44.239 --> 00:02:46.630 
once the breaks have been moved forward
off<00:02:44.630> of<00:02:45.080> the<00:02:45.140> rules<00:02:45.380> and<00:02:45.950> they're<00:02:46.220> free<00:02:46.430> to

00:02:46.630 --> 00:02:46.640 
off of the rules and they're free to

00:02:46.640 --> 00:02:49.270 
off of the rules and they're free to
spin<00:02:46.910> actually<00:02:47.390> pull<00:02:47.630> the<00:02:47.780> handle<00:02:48.200> down<00:02:48.470> this

00:02:49.270 --> 00:02:49.280 
spin actually pull the handle down this

00:02:49.280 --> 00:02:52.540 
spin actually pull the handle down this
mechanism<00:02:49.910> here<00:02:50.709> which<00:02:51.709> is<00:02:51.920> termed<00:02:52.220> as<00:02:52.430> the

00:02:52.540 --> 00:02:52.550 
mechanism here which is termed as the

00:02:52.550 --> 00:02:58.840 
mechanism here which is termed as the
kicker<00:02:55.090> spins<00:02:56.090> the<00:02:56.300> reels<00:02:57.340> it<00:02:58.340> basically

00:02:58.840 --> 00:02:58.850 
kicker spins the reels it basically

00:02:58.850 --> 00:03:02.650 
kicker spins the reels it basically
moves<00:02:59.299> and<00:02:59.799> flicks<00:03:00.799> the<00:03:01.070> wheels<00:03:01.280> to<00:03:02.209> spin<00:03:02.360> them

00:03:02.650 --> 00:03:02.660 
moves and flicks the wheels to spin them

00:03:02.660 --> 00:03:18.699 
moves and flicks the wheels to spin them
around<00:03:13.959> as<00:03:15.160> the<00:03:16.239> kicker<00:03:17.239> kicks<00:03:18.200> the<00:03:18.470> rails

00:03:18.699 --> 00:03:18.709 
around as the kicker kicks the rails

00:03:18.709 --> 00:03:23.470 
around as the kicker kicks the rails
around<00:03:20.530> this<00:03:21.530> little<00:03:21.950> bar<00:03:22.280> here<00:03:22.310> your<00:03:22.880> si<00:03:23.239> will

00:03:23.470 --> 00:03:23.480 
around this little bar here your si will

00:03:23.480 --> 00:03:27.039 
around this little bar here your si will
move<00:03:23.780> forward<00:03:24.470> at<00:03:24.830> the<00:03:25.310> same<00:03:25.580> time<00:03:26.049> we're

00:03:27.039 --> 00:03:27.049 
move forward at the same time we're
