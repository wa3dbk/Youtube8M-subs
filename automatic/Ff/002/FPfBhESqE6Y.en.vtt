00:00:06.440 --> 00:00:11.940
 one of the surprise titles at e3 

00:00:09.240 --> 00:00:13.920
 was tom clancy's Ghost recon plans 

00:00:11.940 --> 00:00:16.410
 this is a 

00:00:13.920 --> 00:00:18.960
 Military shooter an enormously big open 

00:00:16.410 --> 00:00:21.689
 world scenario playing in bolivia 

00:00:18.960 --> 00:00:24.119
 here player controlled either in single 

00:00:21.689 --> 00:00:26.640
 player or in the 4 player co-op mode 

00:00:24.119 --> 00:00:28.800
 a special unit that santa 

00:00:26.640 --> 00:00:30.240
 naked drug cartel and the groups 

00:00:28.800 --> 00:00:32.430
 to take up government 

00:00:30.240 --> 00:00:34.440
 to make the game experience as real as possible 

00:00:32.430 --> 00:00:36.300
 the developers have to do this 

00:00:34.440 --> 00:00:37.980
 a huge and above all one 

00:00:36.300 --> 00:00:40.980
 to create an independent world 

00:00:37.980 --> 00:00:42.899
 but what exactly does that point mean 

00:00:40.980 --> 00:00:45.360
 is that we have created a world 

00:00:42.899 --> 00:00:47.879
 which is really huge but it is not 

00:00:45.360 --> 00:00:48.360
 just big and visually very rich 

00:00:47.879 --> 00:00:50.789
 in 

00:00:48.360 --> 00:00:52.590
 It is also full of autonomous systems 

00:00:50.789 --> 00:00:55.020
 which all happen automatically 

00:00:52.590 --> 00:00:57.420
 And that happens without the player 

00:00:55.020 --> 00:00:59.609
 All these things happen in real time 

00:00:57.420 --> 00:01:01.620
 For example, people go to the market 

00:00:59.609 --> 00:01:03.180
 or go to concerts or even on 

00:01:01.620 --> 00:01:05.460
 sunday line the church 

00:01:03.180 --> 00:01:07.530
 In return , then there is also 

00:01:05.460 --> 00:01:09.900
 the opponent faction makes a 

00:01:07.530 --> 00:01:11.850
 complete drug war in the game and 

00:01:09.900 --> 00:01:14.040
 it all happened independently on 

00:01:11.850 --> 00:01:16.049
 this game world regardless of the player 

00:01:14.040 --> 00:01:18.000
 the player can experience it all but 

00:01:16.049 --> 00:01:22.290
 it does not just happen because he's there 

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:24.659
 is around in this huge world 

00:01:22.290 --> 00:01:27.090
 from a to b needs to be able to move 

00:01:24.659 --> 00:01:28.049
 it either a lot of time or one 

00:01:27.090 --> 00:01:29.820
 quantity of vehicles 

00:01:28.049 --> 00:01:31.200
 and of course the developers have 

00:01:29.820 --> 00:01:33.479
 decided for the latter 

00:01:31.200 --> 00:01:36.270
 But which vehicles are there exactly 

00:01:33.479 --> 00:01:37.890
 played and that important that all 

00:01:36.270 --> 00:01:39.060
 means of transport which one sees also 

00:01:37.890 --> 00:01:41.340
 can be driven 

00:01:39.060 --> 00:01:43.560
 so everything is available accordingly 

00:01:41.340 --> 00:01:45.450
 it is a living world and some 

00:01:43.560 --> 00:01:47.939
 Vehicles are then a little more common 

00:01:45.450 --> 00:01:49.829
 as others for example is one 

00:01:47.939 --> 00:01:51.659
 Of course helicopters are a bit rarer than 

00:01:49.829 --> 00:01:53.610
 a normal car of civilians 

00:01:51.659 --> 00:01:55.140
 So we really offer it completely 

00:01:53.610 --> 00:01:56.909
 different ways and 

00:01:55.140 --> 00:01:58.920
 sometimes you just have to be a battered one 

00:01:56.909 --> 00:01:59.670
 Vehicle take around just fast 

00:01:58.920 --> 00:02:01.860
 get away 

00:01:59.670 --> 00:02:03.329
 but as soon as you leave the path 

00:02:01.860 --> 00:02:04.979
 you can feel the difference quickly 

00:02:03.329 --> 00:02:05.600
 other vehicles to a jeep 

00:02:04.979 --> 00:02:07.740
 example 

00:02:05.600 --> 00:02:09.899
 Of course, there are completely free 

00:02:07.740 --> 00:02:11.520
 shapable game also almost infinite 

00:02:09.899 --> 00:02:12.630
 many missions the player 

00:02:11.520 --> 00:02:15.240
 can graduate 

00:02:12.630 --> 00:02:17.840
 but the linear ones can be used in such a mission 

00:02:15.240 --> 00:02:19.860
 run a completely free world 

00:02:17.840 --> 00:02:21.240
 that is very important to us because we are 

00:02:19.860 --> 00:02:23.370
 have a non-linear history 

00:02:21.240 --> 00:02:24.300
 developed the player is so completely 

00:02:23.370 --> 00:02:26.670
 free and can be over different 

00:02:24.300 --> 00:02:27.900
 possibilities to the goal come everything 

00:02:26.670 --> 00:02:29.520
 you do but somehow then 

00:02:27.900 --> 00:02:31.140
 but to the story about it but when and 

00:02:29.520 --> 00:02:32.750
 how the player gets to the goal 

00:02:31.140 --> 00:02:35.670
 completely left to him 

00:02:32.750 --> 00:02:37.830
 Tom Clancy's Ghost Recon Online Sales 

00:02:35.670 --> 00:02:39.990
 the xbox appears for the playstation 4 

00:02:37.830 --> 00:02:41.880
 from and for the pc the releasedatum 

00:02:39.990 --> 00:02:43.530
 but we are not sure yet 

00:02:41.880 --> 00:02:45.150
 but stay here on our channel 

00:02:43.530 --> 00:02:47.390
 of course, continue on the 

00:02:45.150 --> 00:02:47.390
 current
