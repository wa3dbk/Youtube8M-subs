00:00:39.350 --> 00:00:39.360 
going to go down the paint for the most

00:00:39.360 --> 00:00:41.810 
going to go down the paint for the most
part<00:00:39.540> is<00:00:39.719> really<00:00:40.020> really<00:00:40.200> nice<00:00:40.700> except<00:00:41.700> for

00:00:41.810 --> 00:00:41.820 
part is really really nice except for

00:00:41.820 --> 00:00:43.299 
part is really really nice except for
the<00:00:41.879> visor<00:00:42.090> there<00:00:42.390> is<00:00:42.540> a<00:00:42.570> little<00:00:42.750> bit<00:00:42.930> missing

00:00:43.299 --> 00:00:43.309 
the visor there is a little bit missing

00:00:43.309 --> 00:00:48.229 
the visor there is a little bit missing
but<00:00:44.309> that's<00:00:44.520> just<00:00:44.760> normal<00:00:45.090> I<00:00:46.100> suppose<00:00:47.120> B<00:00:48.120> you

00:00:48.229 --> 00:00:48.239 
but that's just normal I suppose B you

00:00:48.239 --> 00:00:49.490 
but that's just normal I suppose B you
can<00:00:48.360> see<00:00:48.539> all<00:00:48.629> these<00:00:48.719> different<00:00:48.899> markings<00:00:49.289> and

00:00:49.490 --> 00:00:49.500 
can see all these different markings and

00:00:49.500 --> 00:00:52.160 
can see all these different markings and
stuff<00:00:49.680> are<00:00:49.829> really<00:00:50.100> well<00:00:50.219> done<00:00:51.170> tiniest

00:00:52.160 --> 00:00:52.170 
stuff are really well done tiniest

00:00:52.170 --> 00:00:53.600 
stuff are really well done tiniest
little<00:00:52.500> bit<00:00:52.710> of<00:00:52.800> mistake<00:00:53.160> might<00:00:53.370> be<00:00:53.489> on<00:00:53.579> the

00:00:53.600 --> 00:00:53.610 
little bit of mistake might be on the

00:00:53.610 --> 00:00:55.970 
little bit of mistake might be on the
comlink<00:00:53.910> there<00:00:54.410> but<00:00:55.410> that's<00:00:55.500> barely<00:00:55.770> even

00:00:55.970 --> 00:00:55.980 
comlink there but that's barely even

00:00:55.980 --> 00:00:59.479 
comlink there but that's barely even
noticeable<00:00:57.440> it<00:00:58.440> goes<00:00:58.649> around<00:00:58.770> you<00:00:59.129> go<00:00:59.309> on<00:00:59.399> the

00:00:59.479 --> 00:00:59.489 
noticeable it goes around you go on the

00:00:59.489 --> 00:01:02.420 
noticeable it goes around you go on the
chest<00:00:59.730> plate<00:01:00.379> let's<00:01:01.379> sculpt<00:01:01.800> it<00:01:01.890> in<00:01:02.010> and<00:01:02.190> stuff

00:01:02.420 --> 00:01:02.430 
chest plate let's sculpt it in and stuff

00:01:02.430 --> 00:01:05.030 
chest plate let's sculpt it in and stuff
and<00:01:02.730> painted<00:01:03.149> rubel<00:01:03.600> the<00:01:04.470> lines<00:01:04.710> are<00:01:04.979> all

and painted rubel the lines are all

00:01:05.040 --> 00:01:09.320 
and painted rubel the lines are all
really<00:01:05.250> well<00:01:05.519> done<00:01:05.760> glands<00:01:06.750> in<00:01:06.900> the<00:01:07.020> face<00:01:08.330> are

00:01:09.320 --> 00:01:09.330 
really well done glands in the face are

00:01:09.330 --> 00:01:12.679 
really well done glands in the face are
pretty<00:01:09.570> immaculate<00:01:10.170> yeah<00:01:11.100> he's<00:01:11.310> like<00:01:11.689> because

00:01:12.679 --> 00:01:12.689 
pretty immaculate yeah he's like because

00:01:12.689 --> 00:01:14.300 
pretty immaculate yeah he's like because
he's<00:01:12.840> based<00:01:13.320> off<00:01:13.439> a<00:01:13.470> doctor<00:01:13.860> doom<00:01:14.040> from<00:01:14.220> the

00:01:14.300 --> 00:01:14.310 
he's based off a doctor doom from the

00:01:14.310 --> 00:01:18.740 
he's based off a doctor doom from the
Marvel<00:01:14.640> world<00:01:15.860> you<00:01:16.860> go<00:01:16.979> around<00:01:17.420> so<00:01:18.420> his<00:01:18.540> paint

00:01:18.740 --> 00:01:18.750 
Marvel world you go around so his paint

00:01:18.750 --> 00:01:20.780 
Marvel world you go around so his paint
is<00:01:18.869> all<00:01:18.990> similar<00:01:19.320> to<00:01:19.439> that<00:01:19.590> so<00:01:20.340> this<00:01:20.520> shoulder

00:01:20.780 --> 00:01:20.790 
is all similar to that so this shoulder

00:01:20.790 --> 00:01:23.450 
is all similar to that so this shoulder
pads<00:01:21.150> different<00:01:21.659> than<00:01:21.750> this<00:01:21.930> one<00:01:22.310> gets<00:01:23.310> nice

00:01:23.450 --> 00:01:23.460 
pads different than this one gets nice

00:01:23.460 --> 00:01:25.690 
pads different than this one gets nice
variation<00:01:23.790> the<00:01:24.119> back<00:01:24.330> is<00:01:24.540> all<00:01:24.689> done<00:01:24.900> in<00:01:25.080> the

00:01:55.490 --> 00:01:55.500 
really really well done so let's take a

00:01:55.500 --> 00:01:58.370 
really really well done so let's take a
little<00:01:55.950> bit<00:01:56.130> more<00:01:56.340> look<00:01:56.670> at<00:01:57.110> some<00:01:58.110> of<00:01:58.140> the

00:01:58.370 --> 00:01:58.380 
little bit more look at some of the

00:01:58.380 --> 00:02:05.120 
little bit more look at some of the
detailing<00:01:59.310> in<00:01:59.549> here<00:01:59.790> I'm<00:02:00.060> going<00:02:00.210> to<00:02:00.270> go<00:02:04.130> the

00:02:05.120 --> 00:02:05.130 
detailing in here I'm going to go the

00:02:05.130 --> 00:02:07.910 
detailing in here I'm going to go the
plastic<00:02:05.549> amo<00:02:05.759> is<00:02:05.969> really<00:02:06.180> well<00:02:06.509> done<00:02:06.920> it's

00:02:07.910 --> 00:02:07.920 
plastic amo is really well done it's

00:02:07.920 --> 00:02:09.320 
plastic amo is really well done it's
kind<00:02:08.039> of<00:02:08.129> a<00:02:08.220> rubbery<00:02:08.550> plastic<00:02:08.700> and<00:02:09.119> not<00:02:09.209> the

00:02:09.320 --> 00:02:09.330 
kind of a rubbery plastic and not the

00:02:09.330 --> 00:02:10.540 
kind of a rubbery plastic and not the
fabric<00:02:09.690> that<00:02:09.810> kind<00:02:09.989> of<00:02:10.080> doesn't<00:02:10.259> look

00:02:10.540 --> 00:02:10.550 
fabric that kind of doesn't look

00:02:10.550 --> 00:02:12.680 
fabric that kind of doesn't look
realistic<00:02:11.550> on<00:02:11.670> the<00:02:11.760> figures

00:02:12.680 --> 00:02:12.690 
realistic on the figures

00:02:12.690 --> 00:02:15.680 
realistic on the figures
certainly<00:02:12.960> the<00:02:13.080> plastic<00:02:13.470> themselves<00:02:14.540> so<00:02:15.540> this

00:02:15.680 --> 00:02:15.690 
certainly the plastic themselves so this

00:02:15.690 --> 00:02:17.840 
certainly the plastic themselves so this
