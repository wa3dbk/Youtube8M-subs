you out first thing you want to do is

00:05:03.290 --> 00:05:04.240 
you out first thing you want to do is
when<00:05:03.440> you're<00:05:03.560> sitting<00:05:03.770> on<00:05:03.950> the<00:05:04.070> hill<00:05:04.220> like

00:05:04.240 --> 00:05:04.250 
when you're sitting on the hill like

00:05:04.250 --> 00:05:06.120 
when you're sitting on the hill like
this<00:05:04.430> make<00:05:04.970> sure<00:05:05.000> you<00:05:05.330> have<00:05:05.540> your<00:05:05.570> board

00:05:08.950 --> 00:05:08.960 
completely across the fall line which is

00:05:08.960 --> 00:05:12.100 
completely across the fall line which is
the<00:05:09.410> direct<00:05:09.800> path<00:05:10.100> down<00:05:10.430> the<00:05:10.640> hill<00:05:10.850> the<00:05:11.750> reason

00:05:12.100 --> 00:05:12.110 
the direct path down the hill the reason

00:05:12.110 --> 00:05:13.360 
the direct path down the hill the reason
for<00:05:12.140> that<00:05:12.290> is<00:05:12.530> when<00:05:12.680> you<00:05:12.770> get<00:05:12.920> up<00:05:13.100> you<00:05:13.130> don't

00:05:57.070 --> 00:05:57.080 
flat out it's going to start into a side

flat out it's going to start into a side
slip<00:05:57.410> down<00:05:57.620> the<00:05:57.800> hill<00:05:57.980> which<00:05:58.190> is<00:05:58.340> going<00:05:58.520> to<00:05:58.580> be

00:05:58.660 --> 00:05:58.670 
slip down the hill which is going to be

00:05:58.670 --> 00:06:00.540 
slip down the hill which is going to be
the<00:05:58.820> next<00:05:58.970> thing<00:05:59.300> we<00:05:59.450> do

00:06:00.540 --> 00:06:00.550 
the next thing we do

00:06:00.550 --> 00:06:03.990 
the next thing we do
if<00:06:01.170> you<00:06:02.170> have<00:06:02.380> trouble<00:06:02.770> getting<00:06:03.160> up<00:06:03.460> this<00:06:03.730> way

00:06:03.990 --> 00:06:04.000 
if you have trouble getting up this way

00:06:04.000 --> 00:06:06.450 
if you have trouble getting up this way
and<00:06:04.030> a<00:06:04.240> lot<00:06:04.450> of<00:06:04.480> people<00:06:04.840> do<00:06:05.050> and<00:06:05.320> once<00:06:06.070> you<00:06:06.250> get

00:06:06.450 --> 00:06:06.460 
and a lot of people do and once you get

00:06:06.460 --> 00:06:09.180 
and a lot of people do and once you get
to<00:06:06.490> where<00:06:06.790> you<00:06:07.000> can<00:06:07.210> make<00:06:07.390> turns<00:06:07.810> the<00:06:08.650> easiest

00:06:09.180 --> 00:06:09.190 
to where you can make turns the easiest

00:06:09.190 --> 00:06:12.630 
to where you can make turns the easiest
way<00:06:09.370> to<00:06:09.430> get<00:06:09.670> up<00:06:09.880> is<00:06:10.480> facing<00:06:11.080> uphill<00:06:11.430> so<00:06:12.430> let's

00:06:12.630 --> 00:06:12.640 
way to get up is facing uphill so let's

00:06:12.640 --> 00:06:15.330 
way to get up is facing uphill so let's
go<00:06:12.790> over<00:06:13.120> that<00:06:13.300> they'll<00:06:14.140> sit<00:06:14.410> back<00:06:14.590> down<00:06:14.830> so

00:06:15.330 --> 00:06:15.340 
go over that they'll sit back down so

00:06:15.340 --> 00:06:17.700 
go over that they'll sit back down so
