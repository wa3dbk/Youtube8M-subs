started<00:00:04.440> taking<00:00:04.830> the<00:00:04.950> transmission<00:00:05.850> out<00:00:06.000> and

00:00:06.889 --> 00:00:06.899 
started taking the transmission out and

00:00:06.899 --> 00:00:08.600 
started taking the transmission out and
I'll<00:00:06.990> show<00:00:07.170> you<00:00:07.230> where<00:00:07.379> I'm<00:00:07.500> at<00:00:07.620> so<00:00:07.799> far<00:00:08.069> first

00:00:08.600 --> 00:00:08.610 
I'll show you where I'm at so far first

00:00:08.610 --> 00:00:11.629 
I'll show you where I'm at so far first
I've<00:00:08.880> got<00:00:09.030> the<00:00:09.500> the<00:00:10.500> engine<00:00:10.800> chained<00:00:11.070> up<00:00:11.309> there

00:00:11.629 --> 00:00:11.639 
I've got the the engine chained up there

00:00:11.639 --> 00:00:13.400 
I've got the the engine chained up there
wasn't<00:00:11.940> really<00:00:12.000> good<00:00:12.269> place<00:00:12.509> to<00:00:12.750> hook<00:00:13.230> the

00:00:13.400 --> 00:00:13.410 
wasn't really good place to hook the

00:00:13.410 --> 00:00:14.629 
wasn't really good place to hook the
chain<00:00:13.679> so<00:00:13.950> I<00:00:14.009> just<00:00:14.190> wrapped<00:00:14.460> it<00:00:14.580> around

00:00:14.629 --> 00:00:14.639 
chain so I just wrapped it around

00:00:14.639 --> 00:00:17.450 
chain so I just wrapped it around
underneath<00:00:15.630> and<00:00:16.020> put<00:00:16.710> a<00:00:16.740> little<00:00:16.770> towel<00:00:17.100> under

00:00:17.450 --> 00:00:17.460 
underneath and put a little towel under

00:00:17.460 --> 00:00:20.870 
underneath and put a little towel under
the<00:00:17.550> oil<00:00:17.699> pan<00:00:18.140> hopefully<00:00:19.140> I'll<00:00:19.230> hold<00:00:19.850> well<00:00:20.850> I

00:00:20.870 --> 00:00:20.880 
the oil pan hopefully I'll hold well I

00:00:20.880 --> 00:00:22.609 
the oil pan hopefully I'll hold well I
mean<00:00:21.029> I<00:00:21.090> know<00:00:21.150> it'll<00:00:21.420> hold<00:00:21.600> up<00:00:21.810> but<00:00:22.050> I<00:00:22.260> don't

00:00:22.609 --> 00:00:22.619 
mean I know it'll hold up but I don't

00:00:22.619 --> 00:00:26.300 
mean I know it'll hold up but I don't
want<00:00:22.740> to<00:00:22.800> mess<00:00:23.550> up<00:00:23.760> the<00:00:23.880> oil<00:00:24.029> pan<00:00:24.390> and<00:00:24.630> I'm<00:00:25.410> gone

00:00:26.300 --> 00:00:26.310 
want to mess up the oil pan and I'm gone

00:00:26.310 --> 00:00:28.580 
want to mess up the oil pan and I'm gone
ahead<00:00:26.460> and<00:00:26.580> I've<00:00:26.760> got<00:00:26.939> the<00:00:27.050> drive<00:00:28.050> shaft<00:00:28.380> out

00:00:28.580 --> 00:00:28.590 
ahead and I've got the drive shaft out

00:00:28.590 --> 00:00:30.769 
ahead and I've got the drive shaft out
over<00:00:29.160> there<00:00:29.340> in<00:00:29.609> the<00:00:29.849> parking<00:00:30.029> brake<00:00:30.330> assembly

00:00:30.769 --> 00:00:30.779 
over there in the parking brake assembly

00:00:30.779 --> 00:00:33.440 
over there in the parking brake assembly
and<00:00:31.619> I<00:00:32.160> basically<00:00:32.430> got<00:00:32.790> the<00:00:32.850> transmission

00:00:33.440 --> 00:00:33.450 
and I basically got the transmission

00:00:33.450 --> 00:00:36.440 
and I basically got the transmission
itself<00:00:33.719> unbolted<00:00:34.969> excited<00:00:35.969> to<00:00:36.030> go<00:00:36.149> ahead<00:00:36.329> and

00:00:36.440 --> 00:00:36.450 
itself unbolted excited to go ahead and

00:00:36.450 --> 00:00:38.060 
itself unbolted excited to go ahead and
take<00:00:36.600> the<00:00:36.750> transmission<00:00:37.260> bell<00:00:37.500> housing<00:00:37.530> part

00:00:38.060 --> 00:00:38.070 
take the transmission bell housing part

00:00:38.070 --> 00:00:40.910 
take the transmission bell housing part
separate<00:00:38.460> I<00:00:39.110> can't<00:00:40.110> see<00:00:40.290> for<00:00:40.440> sure<00:00:40.590> if<00:00:40.739> that's

00:00:40.910 --> 00:00:40.920 
separate I can't see for sure if that's

00:00:40.920 --> 00:00:43.270 
separate I can't see for sure if that's
the<00:00:41.010> way<00:00:41.160> you're<00:00:41.640> supposed<00:00:41.700> to<00:00:41.969> do<00:00:42.090> it<00:00:42.120> but<00:00:42.360> Ted

00:00:43.270 --> 00:00:43.280 
the way you're supposed to do it but Ted

00:00:43.280 --> 00:00:45.229 
the way you're supposed to do it but Ted
that's<00:00:44.280> the<00:00:44.370> way<00:00:44.489> I<00:00:44.520> went<00:00:44.760> ahead<00:00:44.820> and<00:00:44.969> did<00:00:45.180> it

00:00:45.229 --> 00:00:45.239 
that's the way I went ahead and did it

00:00:45.239 --> 00:00:47.090 
that's the way I went ahead and did it
it<00:00:45.870> lights<00:00:46.140> awfully<00:00:46.559> bright<00:00:46.739> so<00:00:46.920> I'm<00:00:47.010> gonna

00:00:47.090 --> 00:00:47.100 
it lights awfully bright so I'm gonna

00:00:47.100 --> 00:00:50.000 
it lights awfully bright so I'm gonna
come<00:00:47.280> around<00:00:47.430> this<00:00:47.640> side<00:00:48.710> see<00:00:49.710> if<00:00:49.770> I<00:00:49.829> get

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:50.010 
come around this side see if I get

00:00:50.010 --> 00:00:57.470 
come around this side see if I get
better<00:00:50.129> look<00:00:50.510> mm-hmm<00:00:51.510> ah<00:00:52.250> much<00:00:53.250> better<00:00:53.280> I<00:00:56.480> took

00:00:57.470 --> 00:00:57.480 
better look mm-hmm ah much better I took

00:00:57.480 --> 00:01:00.529 
better look mm-hmm ah much better I took
the<00:00:57.719> inspection<00:00:58.260> plate<00:00:58.469> off<00:00:58.649> but<00:00:59.539> you

00:01:00.529 --> 00:01:00.539 
the inspection plate off but you

00:01:00.539 --> 00:01:03.139 
the inspection plate off but you
couldn't<00:01:00.780> really<00:01:00.930> see<00:01:01.260> much<00:01:01.440> in<00:01:01.500> there<00:01:02.149> so

00:01:03.139 --> 00:01:03.149 
couldn't really see much in there so

00:01:03.149 --> 00:01:04.880 
couldn't really see much in there so
I've<00:01:03.270> begun<00:01:03.420> to<00:01:03.570> take<00:01:03.899> the<00:01:04.110> transmission

00:01:04.880 --> 00:01:04.890 
I've begun to take the transmission

00:01:04.890 --> 00:01:07.750 
I've begun to take the transmission
apart<00:01:05.189> as<00:01:05.970> you<00:01:06.180> can<00:01:06.270> see<00:01:06.450> I've<00:01:06.540> got<00:01:06.570> separated

00:01:07.750 --> 00:01:07.760 
apart as you can see I've got separated

00:01:07.760 --> 00:01:12.920 
apart as you can see I've got separated
the<00:01:08.760> one<00:01:08.880> thing<00:01:09.090> holding<00:01:09.360> me<00:01:09.420> up<00:01:09.890> is<00:01:11.659> the<00:01:12.659> drum

00:01:12.920 --> 00:01:12.930 
the one thing holding me up is the drum

00:01:12.930 --> 00:01:14.960 
the one thing holding me up is the drum
right<00:01:13.799> there<00:01:14.010> where<00:01:14.400> the<00:01:14.490> parking<00:01:14.760> brake

00:01:14.960 --> 00:01:14.970 
right there where the parking brake

00:01:14.970 --> 00:01:17.630 
right there where the parking brake
rides<00:01:15.210> on<00:01:15.450> I<00:01:15.720> have<00:01:16.500> to<00:01:16.650> take<00:01:16.830> that<00:01:17.070> off<00:01:17.280> and

00:01:17.630 --> 00:01:17.640 
rides on I have to take that off and

00:01:17.640 --> 00:01:19.960 
rides on I have to take that off and
then<00:01:18.299> I<00:01:18.390> should<00:01:18.600> be<00:01:18.630> able<00:01:18.720> to<00:01:18.930> slide<00:01:19.080> this

00:01:19.960 --> 00:01:19.970 
then I should be able to slide this

00:01:19.970 --> 00:01:22.520 
then I should be able to slide this
transmission<00:01:20.970> back<00:01:21.119> far<00:01:21.420> enough<00:01:21.450> to<00:01:22.350> get<00:01:22.470> it

00:01:22.520 --> 00:01:22.530 
transmission back far enough to get it

00:01:22.530 --> 00:01:26.420 
transmission back far enough to get it
to<00:01:22.619> drop<00:01:22.830> down<00:01:24.110> and<00:01:25.110> come<00:01:25.830> out<00:01:25.979> of<00:01:26.100> there<00:01:26.250> I

00:01:26.420 --> 00:01:26.430 
to drop down and come out of there I

00:01:26.430 --> 00:01:30.170 
to drop down and come out of there I
think<00:01:26.939> not<00:01:27.619> sure<00:01:28.619> how<00:01:28.979> it<00:01:29.159> would<00:01:29.310> go<00:01:29.759> about

00:01:30.170 --> 00:01:30.180 
think not sure how it would go about

00:01:30.180 --> 00:01:32.179 
think not sure how it would go about
getting<00:01:30.570> that<00:01:30.659> mount<00:01:30.930> off<00:01:31.200> that<00:01:31.979> would<00:01:32.070> make

00:01:32.179 --> 00:01:32.189 
getting that mount off that would make

00:01:32.189 --> 00:01:34.160 
getting that mount off that would make
it<00:01:32.220> a<00:01:32.340> little<00:01:32.460> more<00:01:32.579> room<00:01:32.850> but<00:01:33.119> we'll<00:01:33.960> see<00:01:34.140> i

00:01:34.160 --> 00:01:34.170 
it a little more room but we'll see i

00:01:34.170 --> 00:01:36.230 
it a little more room but we'll see i
think<00:01:34.409> if<00:01:34.530> i<00:01:34.619> get<00:01:34.770> that<00:01:34.920> drum<00:01:35.280> off<00:01:35.490> in<00:01:35.790> the<00:01:36.060> back

00:01:36.230 --> 00:01:36.240 
think if i get that drum off in the back

00:01:36.240 --> 00:01:38.630 
think if i get that drum off in the back
i<00:01:36.450> should<00:01:36.630> be<00:01:36.720> alright<00:01:36.990> so<00:01:37.320> i'm<00:01:38.280> just<00:01:38.369> going<00:01:38.579> to

00:01:38.630 --> 00:01:38.640 
i should be alright so i'm just going to

00:01:38.640 --> 00:01:40.609 
i should be alright so i'm just going to
go<00:01:38.729> ahead<00:01:38.820> and<00:01:38.939> take<00:01:39.090> that<00:01:39.150> off<00:01:39.450> and<00:01:39.479> then<00:01:39.960> drop

00:01:40.609 --> 00:01:40.619 
go ahead and take that off and then drop

00:01:40.619 --> 00:01:43.010 
go ahead and take that off and then drop
the<00:01:40.770> transmission<00:01:41.280> out<00:01:41.369> of<00:01:41.490> here<00:01:41.780> and<00:01:42.780> it'll

00:01:43.010 --> 00:01:43.020 
the transmission out of here and it'll

00:01:43.020 --> 00:01:44.630

parts it turns out that you can get the

00:03:04.550 --> 00:03:06.460 
parts it turns out that you can get the
whole<00:03:04.670> pressure<00:03:05.060> plate<00:03:05.390> you<00:03:05.959> know<00:03:06.079> I<00:03:06.110> was

00:03:06.460 --> 00:03:06.470 
whole pressure plate you know I was

00:03:06.470 --> 00:03:08.380 
whole pressure plate you know I was
looking<00:03:06.680> in<00:03:06.769> the<00:03:06.860> book<00:03:07.070> it<00:03:07.310> showed<00:03:08.209> how<00:03:08.239> to

00:03:08.380 --> 00:03:08.390 
looking in the book it showed how to

00:03:08.390 --> 00:03:09.880 
looking in the book it showed how to
take<00:03:08.630> all<00:03:08.810> apart<00:03:09.110> and<00:03:09.170> everything<00:03:09.500> so<00:03:09.680> I<00:03:09.709> was

00:03:09.880 --> 00:03:09.890 
take all apart and everything so I was

00:03:09.890 --> 00:03:11.860 
take all apart and everything so I was
worried<00:03:10.190> that<00:03:10.340> we<00:03:10.430> might<00:03:10.610> have<00:03:10.670> to<00:03:10.940> just<00:03:11.630> buy

00:03:11.860 --> 00:03:11.870 
worried that we might have to just buy

00:03:11.870 --> 00:03:15.520 
worried that we might have to just buy
this<00:03:11.930> little<00:03:12.320> plate<00:03:12.560> and<00:03:13.130> then<00:03:14.110> have<00:03:15.110> to<00:03:15.260> reuse

00:03:15.520 --> 00:03:15.530 
this little plate and then have to reuse

00:03:15.530 --> 00:03:18.100 
this little plate and then have to reuse
everything<00:03:15.709> else<00:03:16.100> but<00:03:16.630> looked<00:03:17.630> at<00:03:17.780> the<00:03:17.870> part

00:03:18.100 --> 00:03:18.110 
everything else but looked at the part

00:03:18.110 --> 00:03:20.770 
everything else but looked at the part
it<00:03:18.410> gets<00:03:18.470> the<00:03:18.739> whole<00:03:18.860> thing<00:03:19.100> so<00:03:19.630> we're<00:03:20.630> good

00:03:20.770 --> 00:03:20.780 
it gets the whole thing so we're good

00:03:20.780 --> 00:03:22.690 
it gets the whole thing so we're good

00:03:22.690 --> 00:03:22.700 
there can you get that and then it's a

00:03:22.700 --> 00:03:24.370

00:03:24.370 --> 00:03:24.380
