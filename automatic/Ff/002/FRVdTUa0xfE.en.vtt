00:00:02.100 --> 00:00:08.219
 the summer in the city to sell not 

00:00:05.220 --> 00:00:10.490
 it could be sunnier but it 's about 

00:00:08.219 --> 00:00:10.490
 to change 

00:00:10.870 --> 00:00:15.430
 this totally freezes and we are with 

00:00:13.360 --> 00:00:17.590
 valentine lover who is animator of 

00:00:15.430 --> 00:00:20.680
 production then first tell us what 

00:00:17.590 --> 00:00:23.529
 it was the hardest thing for you to encourage the 

00:00:20.680 --> 00:00:24.880
 Animal frozen people perhaps because 

00:00:23.529 --> 00:00:26.919
 harder for me to work in the 

00:00:24.880 --> 00:00:29.980
 Elsa character because he is a character 

00:00:26.919 --> 00:00:33.640
 with enough nuances is not white or 

00:00:29.980 --> 00:00:36.220
 black is a character that throughout 

00:00:33.640 --> 00:00:37.660
 the movie has actions that could 

00:00:36.220 --> 00:00:40.770
 be even considered as a 

00:00:37.660 --> 00:00:43.500
 villain of his typical princess disney 

00:00:40.770 --> 00:00:45.330
 and get the audience to understand 

00:00:43.500 --> 00:00:47.280
 why he was doing it because she 

00:00:45.330 --> 00:00:50.699
 it's not bad but what 

00:00:47.280 --> 00:00:52.710
 is scared or misunderstood was a 

00:00:50.699 --> 00:00:55.450
 pretty delicate balance that was that 

00:00:52.710 --> 00:00:58.870
 It was a very interesting challenge 

00:00:55.450 --> 00:01:01.900
 as it is a typical day there is no type 

00:00:58.870 --> 00:01:04.000
 of work that does not exist so I think 

00:01:01.900 --> 00:01:05.440
 that we devote ourselves to that every day you can 

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:07.240
 get there and you have better days where you 

00:01:05.440 --> 00:01:09.460
 you get better you have worse days but 

00:01:07.240 --> 00:01:11.500
 every day is one is a different thing 

00:01:09.460 --> 00:01:12.430
 because you face one to one scene 

00:01:11.500 --> 00:01:15.370
 different 

00:01:12.430 --> 00:01:22.090
 the only routine and typical is that I put 

00:01:15.370 --> 00:01:23.560
 a coffee a raised and July in this case 

00:01:22.090 --> 00:01:25.840
 what we decided was to have a 

00:01:23.560 --> 00:01:28.000
 approach as more instead of instead 

00:01:25.840 --> 00:01:30.009
 to catch some actors from outside but 

00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:32.350
 educate us in animators like 

00:01:30.009 --> 00:01:34.119
 if we were the ones who had to be 

00:01:32.350 --> 00:01:35.830
 in front of the cameras 

00:01:34.119 --> 00:01:37.810
 we wanted to get closer to the animation of 

00:01:35.830 --> 00:01:41.830
 the movie in a very honest way does not 

00:01:37.810 --> 00:01:43.810
 we wanted to start using the 324 trick of 

00:01:41.830 --> 00:01:45.520
 the princess when she sings is we look at the 

00:01:43.810 --> 00:01:48.040
 bookstore and we take that out and put it there 

00:01:45.520 --> 00:01:50.140
 we did not want to say how it is how 

00:01:48.040 --> 00:01:52.000
 feel someone singing how it feels 

00:01:50.140 --> 00:01:54.580
 when singing up a mountain when going down 

00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:56.350
 a staircase and we asked the 

00:01:54.580 --> 00:01:57.520
 actors for example so much that they do not 

00:01:56.350 --> 00:01:59.619
 color like idina menzel have 

00:01:57.520 --> 00:02:01.300
 Broadway experience where you are 

00:01:59.619 --> 00:02:02.050
 working live with your voice in a 

00:02:01.300 --> 00:02:04.270
 scene 

00:02:02.050 --> 00:02:06.460
 and we asked them then what 

00:02:04.270 --> 00:02:09.400
 muscles of your body how is your posture 

00:02:06.460 --> 00:02:10.780
 maybe to get a note and all that 

00:02:09.400 --> 00:02:13.900
 john lasseter was a person I do not know 

00:02:10.780 --> 00:02:15.370
 that encouraged us to use 

00:02:13.900 --> 00:02:17.590
 the breathing of the characters as 

00:02:15.370 --> 00:02:23.350
 character's performance element 

00:02:17.590 --> 00:02:25.210
 how to end the winter feet 

00:02:23.350 --> 00:02:27.400
 down is fresh varnish that you have 

00:02:25.210 --> 00:02:30.040
 you grew up in a stable 

00:02:27.400 --> 00:02:32.650
 what was the most fun they recorded 

00:02:30.040 --> 00:02:36.760
 doing you to see how they moved 

00:02:32.650 --> 00:02:39.189
 You can wear a skirt and walk around 

00:02:36.760 --> 00:02:41.590
 the snow was pretty fun but if 

00:02:39.189 --> 00:02:43.329
 there are the animators are used to 

00:02:41.590 --> 00:02:46.090
 Sometimes we use them as 

00:02:43.329 --> 00:02:47.920
 references to see how as maybe in 

00:02:46.090 --> 00:02:48.579
 the body reacts certain laws 

00:02:47.920 --> 00:02:50.109
 physical 

00:02:48.579 --> 00:02:51.489
 I had some scenes where I had 

00:02:50.109 --> 00:02:53.349
 to be the character singing going up 

00:02:51.489 --> 00:02:55.870
 a staircase and I have some videos out there 

00:02:53.349 --> 00:02:58.239
 in which you see me through the faces of 

00:02:55.870 --> 00:03:01.030
 study doing like this and you see someone from 

00:02:58.239 --> 00:03:02.680
 background that starts but that's something that 

00:03:01.030 --> 00:03:04.060
 it's not for anyone to see it sometimes yes 

00:03:02.680 --> 00:03:05.530
 that we make jokes and suddenly someone 

00:03:04.060 --> 00:03:07.060
 which you do not want to see as a 

00:03:05.530 --> 00:03:09.370
 animator 

00:03:07.060 --> 00:03:10.780
 kiss with another someone puts it and of 

00:03:09.370 --> 00:03:12.909
 port teaches it so that others do not 

00:03:10.780 --> 00:03:16.209
 see that and will ask who that 

00:03:12.909 --> 00:03:17.590
 prevents it from being put, nobody prevents it 

00:03:16.209 --> 00:03:21.359
 that we ourselves do not want to be 

00:03:17.590 --> 00:03:21.359
 laugh prevents it 

00:03:22.920 --> 00:03:25.670
 you give me fear 

00:03:30.989 --> 00:03:34.260
 Disney 

00:03:36.040 --> 00:03:40.980
 Ariel is maybe redhead like me 

00:03:47.620 --> 00:03:50.159
 so boy
