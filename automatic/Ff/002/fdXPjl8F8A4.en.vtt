together I look I look the sky up that
was<00:00:17.850> I<00:00:18.090> thought<00:00:18.300> was<00:00:18.480> Auto<00:00:18.690> clicking<00:00:19.140> and<00:00:19.320> this

00:00:19.439 --> 00:00:21.109 
was I thought was Auto clicking and this
was<00:00:19.590> the<00:00:19.710> stats<00:00:19.980> right<00:00:20.189> so<00:00:20.340> I<00:00:20.369> looked<00:00:20.609> it<00:00:20.789> up<00:00:20.850> I

00:00:21.109 --> 00:00:21.119 
was the stats right so I looked it up I

00:00:21.119 --> 00:00:24.980 
was the stats right so I looked it up I
saw<00:00:21.689> he<00:00:21.930> had<00:00:21.990> 96<00:00:22.650> million<00:00:23.300> 96.7<00:00:24.300> million<00:00:24.630> TV

00:00:24.980 --> 00:00:24.990 
saw he had 96 million 96.7 million TV

00:00:24.990 --> 00:00:26.900 
saw he had 96 million 96.7 million TV
experience<00:00:25.439> right<00:00:25.619> so<00:00:26.160> I<00:00:26.189> was<00:00:26.340> like<00:00:26.430> wow<00:00:26.609> I

00:00:26.900 --> 00:00:26.910 
experience right so I was like wow I

00:00:26.910 --> 00:00:28.580 
experience right so I was like wow I
wanted<00:00:27.420> to<00:00:27.510> track<00:00:27.750> how<00:00:27.930> much<00:00:28.080> experience<00:00:28.380> he

00:00:28.580 --> 00:00:28.590 
wanted to track how much experience he

00:00:28.590 --> 00:00:30.200 
wanted to track how much experience he
gains<00:00:28.800> every<00:00:29.099> day<00:00:29.279> to<00:00:29.340> see<00:00:29.640> like<00:00:29.820> you<00:00:29.970> know<00:00:30.060> how

00:00:30.200 --> 00:00:30.210 
gains every day to see like you know how

00:00:30.210 --> 00:00:32.530 
gains every day to see like you know how
I<00:00:30.810> guess<00:00:31.199> efficient<00:00:31.710> maybe<00:00:31.830> the<00:00:31.980> bot<00:00:32.160> was

00:00:32.530 --> 00:00:32.540 
I guess efficient maybe the bot was

00:00:32.540 --> 00:00:34.610 
I guess efficient maybe the bot was
obviously<00:00:33.540> doesn't<00:00:33.989> look<00:00:34.079> too<00:00:34.200> efficient

00:00:34.610 --> 00:00:34.620 
obviously doesn't look too efficient

00:00:34.620 --> 00:00:36.080 
obviously doesn't look too efficient
because<00:00:34.860> he<00:00:35.070> was<00:00:35.190> stuck<00:00:35.399> at<00:00:35.520> the<00:00:35.640> wall<00:00:35.850> for<00:00:36.030> a

00:00:36.080 --> 00:00:36.090 
because he was stuck at the wall for a

00:00:36.090 --> 00:00:38.209 
because he was stuck at the wall for a
long<00:00:36.149> time<00:00:36.540> so<00:00:37.140> I<00:00:37.200> looked<00:00:37.440> it<00:00:37.530> up<00:00:37.620> today<00:00:37.860> right

00:00:38.209 --> 00:00:38.219 
long time so I looked it up today right

00:00:38.219 --> 00:00:40.040 
long time so I looked it up today right
just<00:00:38.460> ready<00:00:38.670> to<00:00:38.879> upload<00:00:39.480> the<00:00:39.629> other<00:00:39.690> video<00:00:39.960> I

00:00:43.850 --> 00:00:43.860 
looked it up today and his Stevens

00:00:43.860 --> 00:00:46.459 
looked it up today and his Stevens
unranked<00:00:44.219> he<00:00:44.820> got<00:00:45.000> reset<00:00:45.390> his<00:00:45.899> stealing<00:00:46.200> is

00:00:46.459 --> 00:00:46.469 
unranked he got reset his stealing is

00:00:46.469 --> 00:00:48.770 
unranked he got reset his stealing is
level<00:00:46.770> 1<00:00:46.950> now<00:00:47.190> guys<00:00:47.460> he<00:00:47.730> literally<00:00:48.000> got<00:00:48.149> reset

00:00:48.770 --> 00:00:48.780 
level 1 now guys he literally got reset

00:00:48.780 --> 00:00:50.900 
level 1 now guys he literally got reset
you<00:00:49.200> can<00:00:49.350> see<00:00:49.559> 99<00:00:49.890> total<00:00:50.309> levels<00:00:50.550> I<00:00:50.610> would<00:00:50.640> take

00:00:50.900 --> 00:00:50.910 
you can see 99 total levels I would take

00:00:50.910 --> 00:00:52.970 
you can see 99 total levels I would take
it<00:00:51.030> off<00:00:51.120> his<00:00:51.300> total<00:00:51.629> level<00:00:51.870> right<00:00:52.020> there<00:00:52.050> to<00:00:52.739> 0

00:00:52.970 --> 00:00:52.980 
it off his total level right there to 0

00:00:52.980 --> 00:00:55.850 
it off his total level right there to 0
65<00:00:53.399> and<00:00:53.789> that<00:00:54.420> so<00:00:55.320> I<00:00:55.379> guess<00:00:55.530> maybe<00:00:55.649> he<00:00:55.770> lost

00:00:55.850 --> 00:00:55.860 
65 and that so I guess maybe he lost

00:00:55.860 --> 00:00:57.650 
65 and that so I guess maybe he lost
something<00:00:56.129> else<00:00:56.370> not<00:00:56.520> too<00:00:56.640> sure<00:00:56.850> I<00:00:57.059> just<00:00:57.570> know

00:00:57.650 --> 00:00:57.660 
something else not too sure I just know

00:00:57.660 --> 00:00:59.959 
something else not too sure I just know
he's<00:00:57.750> level<00:00:57.960> 1<00:00:58.109> so<00:00:58.320> 98<00:00:58.739> got<00:00:58.949> taken<00:00:59.280> off<00:00:59.399> so<00:00:59.940> that

00:00:59.959 --> 00:00:59.969 
he's level 1 so 98 got taken off so that

00:00:59.969 --> 00:01:02.180 
he's level 1 so 98 got taken off so that
would<00:01:00.329> put<00:01:00.480> it<00:01:00.570> exactly<00:01:00.719> there<00:01:01.289> so<00:01:01.800> as<00:01:02.070> you

00:01:02.180 --> 00:01:02.190

00:02:53.910 --> 00:02:55.640 
bank that reset I feed to get ban on all
these<00:02:54.060> GP<00:02:54.420> as<00:02:54.510> well<00:02:54.690> but<00:02:54.990> I'm<00:02:55.170> not<00:02:55.230> too<00:02:55.470> sure

00:02:55.640 --> 00:02:55.650 
these GP as well but I'm not too sure

00:02:55.650 --> 00:02:56.000 
these GP as well but I'm not too sure
about<00:02:55.680> that

00:02:56.000 --> 00:02:56.010 
about that

00:02:56.010 --> 00:02:58.040 
about that
unless<00:02:57.000> a<00:02:57.150> it's<00:02:57.300> meant<00:02:57.450> to<00:02:57.480> be<00:02:57.570> very<00:02:57.630> curious

00:02:58.040 --> 00:02:58.050 
unless a it's meant to be very curious

00:02:58.050 --> 00:02:59.330 
unless a it's meant to be very curious
to<00:02:58.230> see<00:02:58.260> what<00:02:58.560> other<00:02:58.710> accounts<00:02:59.190> have<00:02:59.310> been

00:02:59.330 --> 00:02:59.340 
to see what other accounts have been

00:02:59.340 --> 00:03:01.100 
to see what other accounts have been
banned<00:02:59.700> recently<00:03:00.210> or<00:03:00.300> reset<00:03:00.750> I<00:03:00.780> guess<00:03:00.960> they're

00:03:01.100 --> 00:03:01.110 
banned recently or reset I guess they're

00:03:01.110 --> 00:03:02.360 
banned recently or reset I guess they're
just<00:03:01.140> resetting<00:03:01.680> this<00:03:01.770> evening<00:03:02.070> well<00:03:02.190> no

00:03:02.360 --> 00:03:02.370 
just resetting this evening well no

00:03:02.370 --> 00:03:03.350 
just resetting this evening well no
which<00:03:02.550> makes<00:03:02.760> sense<00:03:02.970> because<00:03:03.120> you<00:03:03.330> know

00:03:03.350 --> 00:03:03.360 
which makes sense because you know

00:03:03.360 --> 00:03:06.470 
which makes sense because you know
that's<00:03:03.510> what<00:03:03.720> they<00:03:03.810> bonded<00:03:04.230> I<00:03:04.670> mean<00:03:05.670> I<00:03:05.700> would

00:03:06.470 --> 00:03:06.480 
that's what they bonded I mean I would

00:03:06.480 --> 00:03:08.660 
that's what they bonded I mean I would
does<00:03:06.810> it<00:03:07.020> make<00:03:07.260> sense<00:03:07.440> as<00:03:07.650> well<00:03:07.890> -<00:03:08.100> I<00:03:08.370> guess

00:03:08.660 --> 00:03:08.670 
does it make sense as well - I guess

00:03:08.670 --> 00:03:10.730 
does it make sense as well - I guess
banned<00:03:09.120> the<00:03:09.240> whole<00:03:09.390> account<00:03:09.690> but<00:03:09.990> technically

00:03:10.730 --> 00:03:10.740 
banned the whole account but technically

00:03:10.740 --> 00:03:13.130 
banned the whole account but technically
didn't<00:03:11.100> ban<00:03:11.310> all<00:03:11.580> the<00:03:11.760> stats<00:03:12.060> hopefully<00:03:12.630> maybe

00:03:13.130 --> 00:03:13.140 
didn't ban all the stats hopefully maybe

00:03:13.140 --> 00:03:14.780 
didn't ban all the stats hopefully maybe
they<00:03:13.230> just<00:03:13.350> banned<00:03:13.620> the<00:03:13.740> one<00:03:13.920> stat<00:03:14.250> and<00:03:14.490> maybe

00:03:14.780 --> 00:03:14.790 
they just banned the one stat and maybe

00:03:14.790 --> 00:03:16.010 
they just banned the one stat and maybe
that<00:03:14.910> will<00:03:15.030> teach<00:03:15.300> them<00:03:15.480> a<00:03:15.510> lesson<00:03:15.660> if<00:03:15.900> it

00:03:16.010 --> 00:03:16.020 
that will teach them a lesson if it

00:03:16.020 --> 00:03:17.180 
that will teach them a lesson if it
doesn't<00:03:16.350> I'm<00:03:16.470> sure<00:03:16.650> they'll<00:03:16.800> probably<00:03:17.010> get

00:03:17.180 --> 00:03:17.190 
doesn't I'm sure they'll probably get

00:03:17.190 --> 00:03:19.670 
doesn't I'm sure they'll probably get
banned<00:03:17.490> permex<00:03:18.060> time<00:03:18.330> anyways<00:03:19.050> good<00:03:19.320> job<00:03:19.530> on
