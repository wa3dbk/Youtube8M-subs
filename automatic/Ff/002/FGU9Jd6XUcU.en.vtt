00:00:44.930 --> 00:00:44.940 
from the other guys as far as I was

concerned throws ball better you know I
mean<00:00:47.579> I<00:00:47.700> think<00:00:47.910> I<00:00:48.480> if<00:00:49.020> you<00:00:49.079> don't<00:00:49.379> even<00:00:49.590> talk

00:00:49.729 --> 00:00:49.739 
mean I think I if you don't even talk

00:00:49.739 --> 00:00:52.069 
mean I think I if you don't even talk
about<00:00:49.800> ability<00:00:50.550> to<00:00:50.730> escape<00:00:51.149> and<00:00:51.660> Billy<00:00:51.840> to<00:00:52.050> a

00:00:52.069 --> 00:00:52.079 
about ability to escape and Billy to a

00:00:52.079 --> 00:00:53.689 
about ability to escape and Billy to a
run<00:00:52.289> if<00:00:52.469> you<00:00:52.590> just<00:00:52.860> were<00:00:53.039> going<00:00:53.280> to<00:00:53.340> look<00:00:53.489> at

00:00:53.689 --> 00:00:53.699 
run if you just were going to look at

00:00:53.699 --> 00:00:56.389 
run if you just were going to look at
him<00:00:53.850> who<00:00:54.660> throws<00:00:55.140> the<00:00:55.199> ball<00:00:55.530> is<00:00:55.770> the<00:00:55.890> best<00:00:56.129> pure

00:00:56.389 --> 00:00:56.399 
him who throws the ball is the best pure

00:00:56.399 --> 00:00:58.310 
him who throws the ball is the best pure
passer<00:00:56.730> I<00:00:57.000> think<00:00:57.210> that's<00:00:57.750> the<00:00:57.809> defense<00:00:58.170> they

00:00:58.310 --> 00:00:58.320 
passer I think that's the defense they

00:00:58.320 --> 00:01:00.049 
passer I think that's the defense they
lost<00:00:58.500> so<00:00:58.680> many<00:00:58.770> big<00:00:59.039> names<00:00:59.070> what<00:00:59.760> do<00:00:59.820> you<00:00:59.850> think

00:01:00.049 --> 00:01:00.059 
lost so many big names what do you think

00:01:00.059 --> 00:01:02.330 
lost so many big names what do you think
of<00:01:00.239> them<00:01:00.390> I<00:01:00.629> think<00:01:01.109> they<00:01:01.199> would<00:01:01.739> be<00:01:01.770> fired<00:01:02.160> up

00:01:02.330 --> 00:01:02.340 
of them I think they would be fired up

00:01:02.340 --> 00:01:04.100 
of them I think they would be fired up
front<00:01:02.730> and<00:01:02.940> I<00:01:03.090> think<00:01:03.300> the<00:01:03.390> front<00:01:03.660> seven<00:01:04.019> a

00:01:04.100 --> 00:01:04.110 
front and I think the front seven a

00:01:04.110 --> 00:01:06.850 
front and I think the front seven a
defensive<00:01:04.619> line<00:01:04.830> and<00:01:05.159> the<00:01:05.250> secondary<00:01:05.700> be<00:01:05.970> fine

00:01:06.850 --> 00:01:06.860 
defensive line and the secondary be fine

00:01:06.860 --> 00:01:08.870 
defensive line and the secondary be fine
the<00:01:07.860> secondaries<00:01:08.340> got<00:01:08.490> a<00:01:08.520> lot<00:01:08.610> of<00:01:08.640> players

00:01:08.870 --> 00:01:08.880 
the secondaries got a lot of players

00:01:08.880 --> 00:01:10.010 
the secondaries got a lot of players
back<00:01:09.119> but<00:01:09.270> I<00:01:09.299> don't<00:01:09.420> think<00:01:09.510> they<00:01:09.630> were<00:01:09.810> real

00:01:10.010 --> 00:01:10.020 
back but I don't think they were real

00:01:10.020 --> 00:01:13.640 
back but I don't think they were real
strong<00:01:10.530> secondary<00:01:11.220> a<00:01:11.340> year<00:01:11.640> ago<00:01:12.080> so<00:01:13.080> I<00:01:13.110> think

00:01:13.640 --> 00:01:13.650 
strong secondary a year ago so I think

00:01:13.650 --> 00:01:15.859 
strong secondary a year ago so I think
their<00:01:13.950> front<00:01:14.220> seven<00:01:14.520> will<00:01:14.760> be<00:01:14.970> as<00:01:15.600> good<00:01:15.810> as

00:01:15.859 --> 00:01:15.869 
their front seven will be as good as

00:01:15.869 --> 00:01:17.539 
their front seven will be as good as
most<00:01:16.200> in<00:01:16.380> the<00:01:16.439> conference<00:01:16.830> corso<00:01:17.130> house<00:01:17.310> has

00:01:17.539 --> 00:01:17.549 
most in the conference corso house has

00:01:17.549 --> 00:01:20.480 
most in the conference corso house has
or<00:01:17.880> your<00:01:18.119> front<00:01:18.360> seven<00:01:18.720> so<00:01:19.020> does<00:01:19.259> Iowa<00:01:19.680> and<00:01:20.400> I

00:01:20.480 --> 00:01:20.490 
or your front seven so does Iowa and I

00:01:20.490 --> 00:01:22.130 
or your front seven so does Iowa and I
put<00:01:21.060> Penn<00:01:21.210> State<00:01:21.479> probably<00:01:21.840> right<00:01:21.990> behind

00:01:22.130 --> 00:01:22.140 
put Penn State probably right behind

00:01:22.140 --> 00:01:24.020 
put Penn State probably right behind

running<00:01:35.790> back<00:01:36.060> or<00:01:36.090> that<00:01:36.299> was<00:01:36.540> probably<00:01:36.750> the

00:01:36.890 --> 00:01:36.900 
running back or that was probably the

00:01:36.900 --> 00:01:38.569 
running back or that was probably the
biggest<00:01:37.170> issue<00:01:37.530> on<00:01:37.829> offense<00:01:38.220> but<00:01:38.400> I'm<00:01:38.490> a

00:01:38.569 --> 00:01:38.579 
biggest issue on offense but I'm a

00:01:38.579 --> 00:01:42.020 
biggest issue on offense but I'm a
defense<00:01:39.060> I'm<00:01:39.329> concerned<00:01:39.930> that<00:01:40.200> if<00:01:41.100> they<00:01:41.700> if

00:01:42.020 --> 00:01:42.030 
defense I'm concerned that if they if

00:01:42.030 --> 00:01:43.880 
defense I'm concerned that if they if
they<00:01:42.210> don't<00:01:42.420> become<00:01:42.720> more<00:01:43.020> physical<00:01:43.560> I<00:01:43.680> think

00:01:43.880 --> 00:01:43.890 
they don't become more physical I think

00:01:43.890 --> 00:01:45.710 
they don't become more physical I think
becoming<00:01:44.189> physical<00:01:44.880> at<00:01:45.000> Michigan<00:01:45.509> now

00:01:45.710 --> 00:01:45.720 
becoming physical at Michigan now

00:01:45.720 --> 00:01:47.569 
becoming physical at Michigan now

against<00:01:47.880> the<00:01:48.000> spread<00:01:48.299> most<00:01:48.479> of<00:01:48.689> the<00:01:48.780> time<00:01:48.990> of

the spring of the fall but I'm going to

00:01:51.360 --> 00:01:52.850 
the spring of the fall but I'm going to
be<00:01:51.450> anxious<00:01:51.600> to<00:01:51.780> watch<00:01:52.049> their<00:01:52.290> defense<00:01:52.710> if

00:01:52.850 --> 00:01:52.860 
be anxious to watch their defense if

00:01:52.860 --> 00:01:55.670 
be anxious to watch their defense if
their<00:01:53.040> defense<00:01:53.640> isn't<00:01:53.880> physical<00:01:54.509> and<00:01:54.720> doesn't

00:01:55.670 --> 00:01:55.680 
their defense isn't physical and doesn't

00:01:55.680 --> 00:01:57.200 
their defense isn't physical and doesn't
look<00:01:55.799> like<00:01:55.979> if<00:01:56.219> it'll<00:01:56.460> be<00:01:56.549> able<00:01:56.759> to<00:01:56.820> stop<00:01:57.030> the

00:01:57.200 --> 00:01:57.210 
look like if it'll be able to stop the

00:01:57.210 --> 00:01:57.840 
look like if it'll be able to stop the
run

00:01:57.840 --> 00:01:57.850 
run

00:01:57.850 --> 00:01:59.940 
run
it<00:01:57.939> could<00:01:58.270> be<00:01:58.450> a<00:01:58.479> long<00:01:59.110> year<00:01:59.170> for<00:01:59.409> the<00:01:59.619> Michigan

00:01:59.940 --> 00:01:59.950 
it could be a long year for the Michigan

00:01:59.950 --> 00:02:01.440 
it could be a long year for the Michigan
defense<00:02:00.310> anything's<00:02:00.820> can<00:02:00.970> ultimately<00:02:01.060> be

00:02:01.440 --> 00:02:01.450 
defense anything's can ultimately be

00:02:01.450 --> 00:02:03.600 
defense anything's can ultimately be
taking<00:02:02.020> the<00:02:02.080> snaps<00:02:02.350> I've<00:02:02.890> always<00:02:03.159> felt<00:02:03.400> who

00:02:03.600 --> 00:02:03.610 
taking the snaps I've always felt who

00:02:03.610 --> 00:02:05.700 
taking the snaps I've always felt who
was<00:02:03.759> Robinson<00:02:04.330> I<00:02:04.540> really<00:02:05.110> haven't<00:02:05.290> been<00:02:05.409> right

00:02:05.700 --> 00:02:05.710 
was Robinson I really haven't been right

00:02:05.710 --> 00:02:07.109 
was Robinson I really haven't been right
yet<00:02:05.740> and<00:02:06.220> the<00:02:06.280> reason<00:02:06.610> I<00:02:06.670> feel<00:02:06.820> like<00:02:06.940> it's

00:02:07.109 --> 00:02:07.119 
yet and the reason I feel like it's

00:02:07.119 --> 00:02:09.449 
yet and the reason I feel like it's
Robinson<00:02:07.630> is<00:02:07.780> I<00:02:08.229> think<00:02:08.649> the<00:02:08.890> quality<00:02:09.160> that

00:02:09.449 --> 00:02:09.459 
Robinson is I think the quality that

00:02:09.459 --> 00:02:12.510 
Robinson is I think the quality that
rich<00:02:10.300> rodriguez<00:02:10.929> wants<00:02:11.380> I<00:02:11.650> the<00:02:11.860> quarterback

00:02:12.510 --> 00:02:12.520 
rich rodriguez wants I the quarterback

00:02:12.520 --> 00:02:14.970 
rich rodriguez wants I the quarterback
is<00:02:12.550> run<00:02:13.060> first<00:02:13.450> past<00:02:13.870> second<00:02:14.410> when<00:02:14.560> I<00:02:14.680> think

00:02:14.970 --> 00:02:14.980 
is run first past second when I think

00:02:14.980 --> 00:02:18.900 
is run first past second when I think
Roberts<00:02:15.970> in<00:02:16.150> and<00:02:16.420> give<00:02:16.750> him<00:02:17.140> a<00:02:17.709> better<00:02:18.580> run

00:02:18.900 --> 00:02:18.910 
Roberts in and give him a better run

00:02:18.910 --> 00:02:20.699 
Roberts in and give him a better run
game<00:02:19.120> especially<00:02:19.480> with<00:02:19.930> the<00:02:20.050> question<00:02:20.410> marks

00:02:20.699 --> 00:02:20.709 
game especially with the question marks
