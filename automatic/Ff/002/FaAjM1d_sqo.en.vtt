gave them something valuable and they

00:03:25.580 --> 00:03:27.970 
gave them something valuable and they
want<00:03:25.790> to<00:03:25.850> take<00:03:26.180> more<00:03:26.930> it<00:03:27.290> doesn't<00:03:27.709> work<00:03:27.740> this

00:03:27.970 --> 00:03:27.980 
want to take more it doesn't work this

00:03:27.980 --> 00:03:30.250 
want to take more it doesn't work this
way<00:03:28.040> this<00:03:28.370> is<00:03:28.550> working<00:03:28.790> against<00:03:29.600> the<00:03:29.959> rule<00:03:30.230> of

00:03:30.250 --> 00:03:30.260 
way this is working against the rule of

00:03:30.260 --> 00:03:32.050 
way this is working against the rule of
reciprocity<00:03:30.530> i<00:03:31.220> just<00:03:31.490> gave<00:03:31.610> them<00:03:31.790> something

00:03:32.050 --> 00:03:32.060 
reciprocity i just gave them something

00:03:32.060 --> 00:03:34.330 
reciprocity i just gave them something
of<00:03:32.300> value<00:03:32.420> therefore<00:03:33.290> the<00:03:33.380> burden<00:03:33.709> is<00:03:33.830> on<00:03:33.950> them

00:03:34.330 --> 00:03:34.340 
of value therefore the burden is on them

00:03:34.340 --> 00:03:37.510 
of value therefore the burden is on them
to<00:03:34.970> give<00:03:35.180> back<00:03:35.480> to<00:03:35.680> reciprocate<00:03:36.680> that<00:03:37.100> favor

00:03:37.510 --> 00:03:37.520 
to give back to reciprocate that favor

00:03:37.520 --> 00:03:40.180 
to give back to reciprocate that favor
not<00:03:37.820> to<00:03:37.850> take<00:03:38.300> not<00:03:38.660> to<00:03:38.810> ask<00:03:38.959> for<00:03:39.440> more<00:03:39.680> so<00:03:40.160> i
