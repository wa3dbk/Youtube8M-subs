00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.179
 plus 

00:00:25.520 --> 00:00:31.640
 how about friends welcome again to 

00:00:28.970 --> 00:00:36.020
 your channel leandro tech this occasion les 

00:00:31.640 --> 00:00:39.050
 I bring a fun and addictive game that 

00:00:36.020 --> 00:00:42.620
 it's big, and san andrÃ© ok 

00:00:39.050 --> 00:00:43.790
 well I'm going to leave you three links of 

00:00:42.620 --> 00:00:48.620
 download files those that are going to 

00:00:43.790 --> 00:00:52.010
 download that would be the 9 the patch of 

00:00:48.620 --> 00:00:54.080
 I play the file to here ok what 

00:00:52.010 --> 00:00:56.690
 they will do is download the truth 

00:00:54.080 --> 00:01:00.500
 if the downloads are a little heavy 

00:00:56.690 --> 00:01:02.329
 per mega are only three links ok 

00:01:00.500 --> 00:01:04.140
 the file is starting full 

00:01:02.329 --> 00:01:07.260
 between 

00:01:04.140 --> 00:01:10.190
 decompressed weighs 

00:01:07.260 --> 00:01:13.360
 as 2 gigas 

00:01:10.190 --> 00:01:16.940
 two arrivals with 37 370 means off and 

00:01:13.360 --> 00:01:19.640
 good so then I tell them of a 

00:01:16.940 --> 00:01:22.010
 time for that then 

00:01:19.640 --> 00:01:24.320
 the problem that does not discharge them or that 

00:01:22.010 --> 00:01:26.240
 They have very little memory that ok good 

00:01:24.320 --> 00:01:28.360
 they will do is download them once they 

00:01:26.240 --> 00:01:30.940
 have downloaded it 

00:01:28.360 --> 00:01:34.120
 the three files those that come in rar 

00:01:30.940 --> 00:01:38.790
 obviously we are going to decompress them 

00:01:34.120 --> 00:01:38.790
 what would it be that says mind point 2 

00:01:40.310 --> 00:01:45.080
 although once this is done we are going to 

00:01:42.530 --> 00:01:50.130
 grab these two files 

00:01:45.080 --> 00:01:53.039
 we are going to move to the android folder 

00:01:50.130 --> 00:01:54.930
 we go to the folder or baby if not 

00:01:53.039 --> 00:01:56.909
 they have a folder or berber because the 

00:01:54.930 --> 00:01:59.759
 they have to create ok once they have 

00:01:56.909 --> 00:02:01.350
 created now let's open and we're going to 

00:01:59.759 --> 00:02:05.909
 create another folder that is going to be called 

00:02:01.350 --> 00:02:09.390
 as well as point rockstargames point gta s 

00:02:05.909 --> 00:02:12.090
 ok and that's where we're going to place the 

00:02:09.390 --> 00:02:16.170
 decompressed files that would be in 

00:02:12.090 --> 00:02:19.910
 an extension or bb once this is done 

00:02:16.170 --> 00:02:19.910
 we go back to our downloads 

00:02:20.960 --> 00:02:27.040
 and we install the no 

00:02:24.940 --> 00:02:30.220
 I already have it because I do not update it 

00:02:27.040 --> 00:02:33.140
 install it breaks and then once done 

00:02:30.220 --> 00:02:36.190
 this one we open 

00:02:33.140 --> 00:02:38.170
 and that would be all 

00:02:36.190 --> 00:02:40.890
 let's try the game a little bit to 

00:02:38.170 --> 00:02:40.890
 who can see it 

00:02:46.510 --> 00:02:54.610
 maybe it looks a bit slow but 

00:02:50.770 --> 00:02:56.650
 well here this is optional not if 

00:02:54.610 --> 00:02:58.510
 you want to register or if not in 

00:02:56.650 --> 00:03:00.940
 register in case they do not want to because there is no 

00:02:58.510 --> 00:03:02.770
 no problem ok me then I'm not 

00:03:00.940 --> 00:03:05.090
 registered and we will only give you 

00:03:02.770 --> 00:03:08.470
 disconnected 

00:03:05.090 --> 00:03:08.470
 let's wait a little 

00:03:11.560 --> 00:03:16.590
 and he knew right away what you start 

00:03:14.170 --> 00:03:16.590
 departure 

00:03:30.440 --> 00:03:35.000
 the requirements that I recommend 

00:03:32.690 --> 00:03:36.960
 so they can run and in this game 

00:03:35.000 --> 00:03:40.640
 it can be already 

00:03:36.960 --> 00:03:43.950
 a quad or two cores 

00:03:40.640 --> 00:03:47.840
 four-core preference one gig in 

00:03:43.950 --> 00:03:50.920
 ram and you can a video card 

00:03:47.840 --> 00:03:50.920
 we have less 

00:03:51.140 --> 00:03:55.850
 because the next thing to run in a game 

00:03:53.420 --> 00:03:58.220
 of on a media device arrive 

00:03:55.850 --> 00:04:00.950
 round of two nuclei and the truth is 

00:03:58.220 --> 00:04:03.860
 It's hard but my phone is now 

00:04:00.950 --> 00:04:05.510
 this one that I have is this four-core 

00:04:03.860 --> 00:04:09.099
 well 

00:04:05.510 --> 00:04:09.099
 It works very well for me 

00:04:09.810 --> 00:04:16.500
 very adapted in their 

00:04:12.650 --> 00:04:19.850
 It is a very entertaining game 

00:04:16.500 --> 00:04:19.850
 ok let's try 

00:04:20.780 --> 00:04:24.560
 how am I recording that looks a little 

00:04:22.520 --> 00:04:26.830
 slow but really the game runs very 

00:04:24.560 --> 00:04:26.830
 very 

00:04:29.390 --> 00:04:33.730
 As you can see the buttons are very 

00:04:30.920 --> 00:04:33.730
 well adapted 

00:04:36.070 --> 00:04:43.940
 in some 

00:04:38.390 --> 00:04:47.180
 some doubt is only then I 

00:04:43.940 --> 00:04:48.889
 recover your doubts if you want someone else 

00:04:47.180 --> 00:04:51.620
 game 

00:04:48.889 --> 00:04:54.889
 so you can not download it x reasons 

00:04:51.620 --> 00:04:57.349
 just do let's see and then I'll 

00:04:54.889 --> 00:05:00.650
 I 'll get it without uploading a video 

00:04:57.349 --> 00:05:03.110
 so that they can enjoy the ok 

00:05:00.650 --> 00:05:05.419
