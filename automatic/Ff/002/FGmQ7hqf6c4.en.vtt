00:00:07.180 --> 00:00:11.389
 I'm probably one of mobile de we 

00:00:09.620 --> 00:00:12.559
 Here are the typo keyboard you 

00:00:11.389 --> 00:00:14.570
 are interesting in that respect 

00:00:12.559 --> 00:00:15.920
 maybe it has heard of it and in the process 

00:00:14.570 --> 00:00:17.330
 We also read, I do not know if we are 

00:00:15.920 --> 00:00:18.620
 have written about it 

00:00:17.330 --> 00:00:21.350
 In any case, supported by Ryan Seacrest 

00:00:18.620 --> 00:00:23.960
 the militant one or the other 

00:00:21.350 --> 00:00:25.310
 is a case for the iphone 5 and iphone 

00:00:23.960 --> 00:00:27.530
 5 it in the case 

00:00:25.310 --> 00:00:29.690
 what you can already see here 

00:00:27.530 --> 00:00:31.850
 is simply pushed it and then 

00:00:29.690 --> 00:00:33.620
 a complete finished keyboard 

00:00:31.850 --> 00:00:34.970
 or short keyboard if then 

00:00:33.620 --> 00:00:37.970
 someday the international version 

00:00:34.970 --> 00:00:40.580
 offers offers and thus the tap on 

00:00:37.970 --> 00:00:42.800
 lighten the iphone 5 or iphone 4s 

00:00:40.580 --> 00:00:45.020
 should also give you the complete 

00:00:42.800 --> 00:00:46.610
 can use a screen is a pretty 

00:00:45.020 --> 00:00:48.020
 interesting thing because it does that 

00:00:46.610 --> 00:00:49.730
 Although it gets a whole corner 

00:00:48.020 --> 00:00:51.620
 longer than at the end you have here 

00:00:49.730 --> 00:00:53.030
 then gets what but there is 

00:00:51.620 --> 00:00:54.890
 maybe eventually the iphone will 

00:00:53.030 --> 00:00:56.690
 I would be about an inch longer 

00:00:54.890 --> 00:00:59.510
 say now necessarily makes 

00:00:56.690 --> 00:01:01.820
 much thicker but should as I said 

00:00:59.510 --> 00:01:03.550
 I can help very much if I can 

00:01:01.820 --> 00:01:06.909
 So here's our beautiful one 

00:01:03.550 --> 00:01:06.909
 enter name 

00:01:07.200 --> 00:01:12.500
 mobotix I know now, of course, to 

00:01:09.659 --> 00:01:12.500
 but practice for it 

00:01:19.230 --> 00:01:22.990
 No 

00:01:20.590 --> 00:01:24.250
 seems to work pretty well 

00:01:22.990 --> 00:01:25.509
 I do not know Germany now 

00:01:24.250 --> 00:01:27.759
 to be able to type faster than on 

00:01:25.509 --> 00:01:28.840
 a mainboard but probably 

00:01:27.759 --> 00:01:30.609
 should speed up a bit 

00:01:28.840 --> 00:01:32.439
 be brighter reminds you of the form 

00:01:30.609 --> 00:01:33.969
 here when only the buttons here looks like 

00:01:32.439 --> 00:01:35.890
 through this advertising and so on 

00:01:33.969 --> 00:01:38.709
 are relatively strong on for example 

00:01:35.890 --> 00:01:40.060
 blackberry or something like that should be 99 

00:01:38.709 --> 00:01:42.700
 dollar costs in the us 

00:01:40.060 --> 00:01:45.729
 reason should be available soon 

00:01:42.700 --> 00:01:47.649
 what they do here is insofar as it is 

00:01:45.729 --> 00:01:48.700
 not just a pure case but you 

00:01:47.649 --> 00:01:50.649
 have just a little more 

00:01:48.700 --> 00:01:51.850
 technology in there, among other things 

00:01:50.649 --> 00:01:54.009
 the device connects itself per 

00:01:51.850 --> 00:01:55.329
 bluetooth and there is a small one here 

00:01:54.009 --> 00:01:57.340
 Backlight if I am now 

00:01:55.329 --> 00:01:59.349
 So my hand over today is very much that 

00:01:57.340 --> 00:02:00.189
 if you typed in the keyboard as well 

00:01:59.349 --> 00:02:02.049
 is illuminated 

00:02:00.189 --> 00:02:03.759
 And here is the replacement for the outside 

00:02:02.049 --> 00:02:05.289
 home button at the moment because 

00:02:03.759 --> 00:02:07.329
 I cover the covers of course 

00:02:05.289 --> 00:02:10.090
 I am so lost here so easy 

00:02:07.329 --> 00:02:11.950
 use the homebutton and thus the 

00:02:10.090 --> 00:02:13.120
 actual home button of the iphone 5 s 

00:02:11.950 --> 00:02:14.709
 replace what a bit 

00:02:13.120 --> 00:02:17.170
 pity is because of course, the 

00:02:14.709 --> 00:02:19.959
 lost support for tacchelli 

00:02:17.170 --> 00:02:22.299
 the company has solved the whole thing that way 

00:02:19.959 --> 00:02:24.160
 that if I could pull this off 

00:02:22.299 --> 00:02:25.930
 see here is still in there 

00:02:24.160 --> 00:02:27.400
 a very very thin let's say how 

00:02:25.930 --> 00:02:29.709
 we already have them in another video of 

00:02:27.400 --> 00:02:31.480
 have shown us such a location very much 

00:02:29.709 --> 00:02:34.660
 thin layer of a battery inside of the intended 

00:02:31.480 --> 00:02:36.370
 resignation lasted about 14 days 

00:02:34.660 --> 00:02:39.310
 connected as I said and easy 

00:02:36.370 --> 00:02:40.720
 postponed engaged quite simply a 

00:02:39.310 --> 00:02:43.080
 and on the left side we have the 

00:02:40.720 --> 00:02:45.000
 micro usb port to load 

00:02:43.080 --> 00:02:47.130
 he keeps me necessary on his iphone 

00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:49.050
 5 to be able to type faster must 

00:02:47.130 --> 00:02:49.590
 unfortunately, relatively low in the cash 

00:02:49.050 --> 00:02:52.820
 to grab 

00:02:49.590 --> 00:02:56.070
 but you get a pretty good one 

00:02:52.820 --> 00:02:57.990
 hardware keyboard so to speak for iphone 5 

00:02:56.070 --> 00:02:59.970
 s and so much longer is the phone 

00:02:57.990 --> 00:03:01.380
 not to mention anything 

00:02:59.970 --> 00:03:03.630
 that in any case they are here 

00:03:01.380 --> 00:03:05.010
 below ensure that all ports 

00:03:03.630 --> 00:03:06.510
 stay accessible you have so here 

00:03:05.010 --> 00:03:09.960
 your headphone jack is on the 

00:03:06.510 --> 00:03:12.300
 left side and with the people of 

00:03:09.960 --> 00:03:14.970
 apple of course also preserved 

00:03:12.300 --> 00:03:16.710
 Now the question would be if she is with 

00:03:14.970 --> 00:03:18.800
 lightning load no here is so 

00:03:16.710 --> 00:03:21.360
 national micro-usb turn 

00:03:18.800 --> 00:03:23.880
 it was actually this is the 

00:03:21.360 --> 00:03:25.170
 keyword what the next one would be is 

00:03:23.880 --> 00:03:28.190
 expected and not even a mobile 

00:03:25.170 --> 00:03:28.190
 Giggs also look again
