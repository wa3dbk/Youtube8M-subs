00:02:36.360 --> 00:02:36.370 
just as a simple fact that it will be a

00:02:36.370 --> 00:02:38.009 
just as a simple fact that it will be a
good<00:02:36.580> selling<00:02:36.970> point<00:02:37.000> and<00:02:37.420> to<00:02:37.600> be<00:02:37.690> honest<00:02:37.930> a

00:02:38.009 --> 00:02:38.019 
good selling point and to be honest a

00:02:38.019 --> 00:02:40.920 
good selling point and to be honest a
could<00:02:38.230> actually<00:02:38.470> be<00:02:38.890> pretty<00:02:39.160> fun<00:02:39.400> to<00:02:39.519> use<00:02:39.730> a<00:02:39.940> pc

00:02:40.920 --> 00:02:40.930 
could actually be pretty fun to use a pc

00:02:40.930 --> 00:02:42.180 
could actually be pretty fun to use a pc
if<00:02:41.110> you<00:02:41.230> didn't<00:02:41.470> know<00:02:41.560> stands<00:02:41.860> for<00:02:42.010> armored

warfare<00:02:44.440> pretty<00:02:45.160> much<00:02:45.310> the<00:02:45.400> transport<00:02:45.910> troops

00:02:46.170 --> 00:02:46.180 
warfare pretty much the transport troops

00:02:46.180 --> 00:02:47.759 
warfare pretty much the transport troops
you<00:02:46.390> don't<00:02:46.540> really<00:02:46.720> use<00:02:46.900> it<00:02:46.930> as<00:02:47.140> like<00:02:47.319> a<00:02:47.350> backup

00:02:47.759 --> 00:02:47.769 
you don't really use it as like a backup

00:02:47.769 --> 00:02:50.190 
you don't really use it as like a backup
to<00:02:47.890> like<00:02:48.130> so<00:02:48.310> you<00:02:48.400> what<00:02:48.549> a<00:02:48.580> tank<00:02:48.880> so<00:02:49.690> I'm<00:02:49.840> hoping

00:02:50.190 --> 00:02:50.200 
to like so you what a tank so I'm hoping

00:02:50.200 --> 00:02:52.470 
to like so you what a tank so I'm hoping
that<00:02:50.260> they<00:02:50.650> put<00:02:50.890> it<00:02:50.980> into<00:02:51.160> the<00:02:51.190> game<00:02:51.430> and<00:02:51.610> by

00:02:52.470 --> 00:02:52.480 
that they put it into the game and by

00:02:52.480 --> 00:02:55.740 
that they put it into the game and by
the<00:02:52.540> way<00:02:53.700> by<00:02:54.700> armored<00:02:55.239> it<00:02:55.359> doesn't<00:02:55.630> really

00:02:55.740 --> 00:02:55.750 
the way by armored it doesn't really

00:02:55.750 --> 00:02:57.599 
the way by armored it doesn't really
mean<00:02:55.930> you<00:02:56.049> know<00:02:56.170> it<00:02:56.260> can<00:02:56.350> absorb<00:02:56.609> grenade

00:02:57.599 --> 00:02:57.609 
mean you know it can absorb grenade

00:02:57.609 --> 00:03:00.140 
mean you know it can absorb grenade
launchers<00:02:58.120> or<00:02:58.329> rockets<00:02:59.320> or<00:02:59.590> stuff<00:02:59.829> like<00:02:59.950> that

00:03:00.140 --> 00:03:00.150 
launchers or rockets or stuff like that

00:03:00.150 --> 00:03:02.069 
launchers or rockets or stuff like that
basically<00:03:01.150> just<00:03:01.299> means<00:03:01.450> that<00:03:01.660> you<00:03:01.840> know<00:03:01.870> it

00:03:02.069 --> 00:03:02.079 
basically just means that you know it

00:03:02.079 --> 00:03:03.990 
basically just means that you know it
can<00:03:02.230> take<00:03:02.620> some<00:03:02.799> more<00:03:02.890> alarms<00:03:03.190> fire<00:03:03.430> but<00:03:03.760> not

00:03:03.990 --> 00:03:04.000 
can take some more alarms fire but not

00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:06.360 
can take some more alarms fire but not
totally<00:03:04.810> obviously<00:03:05.500> to<00:03:05.680> a<00:03:05.709> certain<00:03:06.070> extent

00:03:06.360 --> 00:03:06.370 
totally obviously to a certain extent

00:03:06.370 --> 00:03:08.220 
totally obviously to a certain extent
and<00:03:06.579> so<00:03:07.060> I'm<00:03:07.120> hoping<00:03:07.420> that<00:03:07.480> if<00:03:07.720> they<00:03:07.870> do<00:03:08.049> put

00:03:08.220 --> 00:03:08.230 
and so I'm hoping that if they do put

00:03:08.230 --> 00:03:09.300 
and so I'm hoping that if they do put
them<00:03:08.350> in<00:03:08.440> there<00:03:08.590> they're<00:03:08.769> not<00:03:08.890> going<00:03:08.980> to<00:03:09.040> be

00:03:09.300 --> 00:03:09.310 
them in there they're not going to be

00:03:09.310 --> 00:03:11.520 
them in there they're not going to be
like<00:03:09.459> you<00:03:09.519> know<00:03:09.750> they<00:03:10.750> just<00:03:10.870> drive<00:03:11.079> around<00:03:11.260> the

00:03:11.520 --> 00:03:11.530 
like you know they just drive around the

00:03:11.530 --> 00:03:13.710 
like you know they just drive around the
map<00:03:11.739> and<00:03:12.040> gunning<00:03:12.400> baby<00:03:12.640> getting<00:03:13.239> people<00:03:13.540> down

00:03:13.710 --> 00:03:13.720 
map and gunning baby getting people down

00:03:13.720 --> 00:03:15.449 
map and gunning baby getting people down
in<00:03:13.930> the<00:03:14.380> tower<00:03:14.650> if<00:03:14.890> there's<00:03:15.100> going<00:03:15.280> to<00:03:15.340> be<00:03:15.400> a

00:03:15.449 --> 00:03:15.459 
in the tower if there's going to be a

00:03:15.459 --> 00:03:16.740 
in the tower if there's going to be a
terror<00:03:15.700> on<00:03:15.820> oh<00:03:15.850> maybe<00:03:16.120> it's<00:03:16.480> just<00:03:16.570> a

00:03:16.740 --> 00:03:16.750 
terror on oh maybe it's just a

00:03:16.750 --> 00:03:17.880 
terror on oh maybe it's just a
killstreak<00:03:17.079> you<00:03:17.350> notice<00:03:17.560> but<00:03:17.620> I'm<00:03:17.709> not<00:03:17.799> really

killstreak you notice but I'm not really

00:03:17.890 --> 00:03:19.050 
killstreak you notice but I'm not really
sure<00:03:18.010> how<00:03:18.250> it<00:03:18.280> could<00:03:18.549> be<00:03:18.579> used<00:03:18.700> as<00:03:19.000> a

00:03:19.050 --> 00:03:19.060 
sure how it could be used as a

00:03:19.060 --> 00:03:21.720 
sure how it could be used as a
killstreak<00:03:19.859> to<00:03:20.859> be<00:03:20.980> quite<00:03:21.190> honest<00:03:21.459> maybe<00:03:21.609> I

00:03:21.720 --> 00:03:21.730 
killstreak to be quite honest maybe I

00:03:21.730 --> 00:03:23.430 
killstreak to be quite honest maybe I
gets<00:03:21.880> dropped<00:03:22.090> in<00:03:22.329> who<00:03:22.870> knows<00:03:23.079> I'm<00:03:23.319> to
