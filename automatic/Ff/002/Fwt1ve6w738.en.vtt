00:00:11.250 --> 00:00:11.260 
oh come on genetic calm and in this

00:00:11.260 --> 00:00:12.480 
oh come on genetic calm and in this
video<00:00:11.440> we're<00:00:11.680> going<00:00:11.770> to<00:00:11.830> be<00:00:11.920> taking<00:00:12.040> a<00:00:12.250> look<00:00:12.340> at

00:00:12.480 --> 00:00:12.490 
video we're going to be taking a look at

00:00:12.490 --> 00:00:14.070 
video we're going to be taking a look at
some<00:00:12.640> benchmarks<00:00:13.270> applications<00:00:13.810> and<00:00:14.020> you

00:00:14.070 --> 00:00:14.080 
some benchmarks applications and you

00:00:14.080 --> 00:00:15.960 
some benchmarks applications and you
know<00:00:14.200> I<00:00:14.230> see<00:00:14.500> how<00:00:14.620> old<00:00:14.860> is<00:00:14.950> performs<00:00:15.400> because

00:00:15.960 --> 00:00:15.970 
know I see how old is performs because

00:00:15.970 --> 00:00:17.580 
know I see how old is performs because

processor clocked at 1.5 gigahertz so

00:00:20.410 --> 00:00:21.810 
processor clocked at 1.5 gigahertz so
we're<00:00:21.039> going<00:00:21.160> to<00:00:21.250> see<00:00:21.340> what<00:00:21.460> kind<00:00:21.610> of<00:00:21.670> results

00:00:21.810 --> 00:00:21.820 
we're going to see what kind of results

00:00:21.820 --> 00:00:23.910 
we're going to see what kind of results
we<00:00:22.180> get<00:00:22.420> first<00:00:23.200> of<00:00:23.380> all<00:00:23.440> we're<00:00:23.590> going<00:00:23.619> to<00:00:23.800> load

00:00:23.910 --> 00:00:23.920 
we get first of all we're going to load

00:00:27.420 --> 00:00:27.430 
run the single Fred cruelly quick run a

00:00:27.430 --> 00:00:29.150 
run the single Fred cruelly quick run a
couple<00:00:27.730> of<00:00:27.880> times<00:00:28.060> then<00:00:28.240> we<00:00:28.360> do<00:00:28.480> more<00:00:28.660> effort

00:00:29.150 --> 00:00:29.160 
couple of times then we do more effort

00:00:29.160 --> 00:00:36.270 
couple of times then we do more effort
get<00:00:30.160> 51<00:00:31.859> 51<00:00:33.329> about<00:00:34.329> three<00:00:34.600> times<00:00:34.839> 51<00:00:35.620> so<00:00:35.890> we<00:00:36.129> got

00:00:36.270 --> 00:00:36.280 
get 51 51 about three times 51 so we got

00:00:36.280 --> 00:00:39.719 
get 51 51 about three times 51 so we got
back<00:00:36.460> on<00:00:36.699> average<00:00:37.120> about<00:00:37.239> 51<00:00:38.399> miss<00:00:39.399> world<00:00:39.579> my

thread<00:00:40.120> movie<00:00:40.539> thread<00:00:40.809> we<00:00:40.929> get<00:00:41.109> 119<00:00:44.129> 111<00:00:45.129> the

00:00:45.270 --> 00:00:45.280 
thread movie thread we get 119 111 the

00:00:45.280 --> 00:00:48.660 
thread movie thread we get 119 111 the
maximum<00:00:45.699> about<00:00:46.139> 151<00:00:47.249> around<00:00:48.249> that<00:00:48.429> it's<00:00:48.579> gone

00:00:48.660 --> 00:00:48.670 
maximum about 151 around that it's gone

00:00:48.670 --> 00:00:52.379 
maximum about 151 around that it's gone
out<00:00:48.789> to<00:00:48.909> 137<00:00:50.579> so<00:00:51.579> you<00:00:51.639> could<00:00:51.760> get<00:00:51.909> a<00:00:51.969> little<00:00:52.299> bit

00:00:52.379 --> 00:00:52.389 
out to 137 so you could get a little bit

00:00:52.389 --> 00:00:54.719 
out to 137 so you could get a little bit
higher<00:00:52.539> than<00:00:52.569> that<00:00:52.899> and<00:00:53.440> before<00:00:54.010> I<00:00:54.219> did<00:00:54.579> these

00:00:54.719 --> 00:00:54.729 
higher than that and before I did these

00:00:54.729 --> 00:00:57.619 
higher than that and before I did these
tests<00:00:54.999> I<00:00:55.149> did<00:00:55.329> restart<00:00:55.809> the<00:00:55.960> phone<00:00:56.139> so<00:00:57.100> no

00:00:57.619 --> 00:00:57.629 
tests I did restart the phone so no

00:00:57.629 --> 00:00:59.910 
tests I did restart the phone so no
other<00:00:58.629> application<00:00:59.229> should<00:00:59.379> be<00:00:59.530> running<00:00:59.709> in

00:00:59.910 --> 00:00:59.920 
other application should be running in

00:00:59.920 --> 00:01:03.270 
other application should be running in
the<00:01:00.039> background<00:01:01.049> I'll<00:01:02.049> go<00:01:02.199> about<00:01:02.319> 137<00:01:02.920> I<00:01:03.100> think

00:01:03.270 --> 00:01:03.280 
the background I'll go about 137 I think

00:01:03.280 --> 00:01:07.200 
the background I'll go about 137 I think
was<00:01:03.399> the<00:01:03.429> highest<00:01:03.879> 1<00:01:04.089> 105<00:01:04.899> c<00:01:05.729> the<00:01:06.729> word<00:01:06.939> the

00:01:07.200 --> 00:01:07.210 
was the highest 1 105 c the word the

00:01:07.210 --> 00:01:14.569 
was the highest 1 105 c the word the
results<00:01:07.630> kind<00:01:07.810> of<00:01:07.930> vary<00:01:08.200> from<00:01:08.530> each<00:01:09.159> chest<00:01:12.930> 117

00:01:14.569 --> 00:01:14.579 
results kind of vary from each chest 117

00:01:14.579 --> 00:01:17.730 
results kind of vary from each chest 117
but<00:01:15.579> previously<00:01:16.390> when<00:01:16.570> I've<00:01:16.689> done<00:01:16.810> it<00:01:16.990> the

00:01:17.730 --> 00:01:17.740 
but previously when I've done it the

00:01:17.740 --> 00:01:20.249 
but previously when I've done it the
results<00:01:18.100> I<00:01:18.159> got<00:01:18.310> the<00:01:18.520> highest<00:01:18.670> 1i<00:01:18.939> got<00:01:19.149> was<00:01:19.259> 151

00:01:20.249 --> 00:01:20.259 
results I got the highest 1i got was 151

00:01:20.259 --> 00:01:22.170 
results I got the highest 1i got was 151
those<00:01:21.039> without<00:01:21.250> that<00:01:21.609> was<00:01:21.729> the<00:01:21.820> highest<00:01:22.060> one

00:01:22.170 --> 00:01:22.180 
those without that was the highest one

00:01:22.180 --> 00:01:25.649 
those without that was the highest one
of<00:01:22.299> God<00:01:22.479> so<00:01:23.219> just<00:01:24.219> give<00:01:24.490> an<00:01:24.640> idea<00:01:24.729> of<00:01:25.000> what<00:01:25.329> it's

00:01:25.649 --> 00:01:25.659 
of God so just give an idea of what it's

00:01:25.659 --> 00:01:27.690 
of God so just give an idea of what it's
like<00:01:25.869> go<00:01:26.289> 135<00:01:26.829> day<00:01:27.009> I'm<00:01:27.070> gonna<00:01:27.219> take<00:01:27.399> a<00:01:27.460> look<00:01:27.609> at

00:01:27.690 --> 00:01:27.700 
like go 135 day I'm gonna take a look at

00:01:27.700 --> 00:01:29.340 
like go 135 day I'm gonna take a look at
another<00:01:27.820> one<00:01:27.969> really<00:01:28.240> quick<00:01:28.420> we're<00:01:29.170> going<00:01:29.259> to

00:01:29.340 --> 00:01:29.350 
another one really quick we're going to

00:01:29.350 --> 00:01:31.050 
another one really quick we're going to
open<00:01:29.530> up<00:01:29.619> smart<00:01:30.039> bench<00:01:30.250> we're<00:01:30.490> gonna<00:01:30.670> see<00:01:30.880> how

00:01:31.050 --> 00:01:31.060 
open up smart bench we're gonna see how

00:01:31.060 --> 00:01:34.740 
open up smart bench we're gonna see how
that<00:01:31.390> performs<00:01:31.869> as<00:01:32.020> well<00:01:32.939> small<00:01:33.939> bench<00:01:34.179> 2012

00:01:34.740 --> 00:01:34.750 
that performs as well small bench 2012

00:01:34.750 --> 00:01:38.310 
that performs as well small bench 2012
when<00:01:34.990> I<00:01:35.020> run<00:01:35.200> it<00:01:36.630> just<00:01:37.630> going<00:01:37.750> to<00:01:37.810> see<00:01:37.990> you<00:01:38.200> know

00:01:38.310 --> 00:01:38.320 
when I run it just going to see you know

00:01:38.320 --> 00:01:43.649 
when I run it just going to see you know
kind<00:01:39.100> of<00:01:39.130> results<00:01:39.460> we<00:01:39.490> gotta<00:01:39.759> end<00:01:42.659> hopefully

00:01:43.649 --> 00:01:43.659 
kind of results we gotta end hopefully

00:01:43.659 --> 00:01:46.469 
kind of results we gotta end hopefully
this<00:01:44.049> should<00:01:44.079> be<00:01:44.320> a<00:01:44.350> producer<00:01:44.710> necros<00:01:45.280> oh<00:01:45.479> and

00:01:46.469 --> 00:01:46.479 
this should be a producer necros oh and

00:01:46.479 --> 00:01:48.330 
this should be a producer necros oh and
it<00:01:46.749> does<00:01:46.899> have<00:01:46.929> a<00:01:47.109> quad-core<00:01:47.439> processor<00:01:48.009> so<00:01:48.249> it

00:01:48.330 --> 00:01:48.340 
it does have a quad-core processor so it

00:01:48.340 --> 00:01:50.730 
it does have a quad-core processor so it
should<00:01:48.520> be<00:01:48.549> good<00:01:48.670> by<00:01:49.030> para<00:01:49.780> nikka<00:01:50.140> get<00:01:50.380> better

00:01:50.730 --> 00:01:50.740 
should be good by para nikka get better

00:01:50.740 --> 00:01:52.340 
should be good by para nikka get better

00:02:10.889 --> 00:02:10.899 
display index scores similar but maybe

00:02:10.899 --> 00:02:21.199 
display index scores similar but maybe
you<00:02:10.989> can<00:02:11.110> see<00:02:11.349> it<00:02:16.140> device<00:02:17.140> you<00:02:17.860> got<00:02:19.500> 4913

00:02:21.199 --> 00:02:21.209 
you can see it device you got 4913

00:02:21.209 --> 00:02:24.390 
you can see it device you got 4913
that's<00:02:22.209> for<00:02:22.420> productivity<00:02:23.230> index<00:02:23.650> the<00:02:24.069> gaming

that's for productivity index the gaming

00:02:24.400 --> 00:02:29.610 
that's for productivity index the gaming
index<00:02:24.760> is<00:02:25.950> 2706<00:02:26.950> so<00:02:27.940> you<00:02:28.930> can<00:02:29.080> see<00:02:29.230> it's<00:02:29.440> like<00:02:29.590> a

00:02:29.610 --> 00:02:29.620 
index is 2706 so you can see it's like a

00:02:29.620 --> 00:02:34.110 
index is 2706 so you can see it's like a
lot<00:02:29.860> faster<00:02:30.040> than<00:02:30.340> the<00:02:30.459> Prime<00:02:32.340> galaxy<00:02:33.340> s2<00:02:33.459> and

lot faster than the Prime galaxy s2 and

00:02:34.120 --> 00:02:36.140 
lot faster than the Prime galaxy s2 and
only<00:02:34.420> these<00:02:34.540> other<00:02:34.720> devices<00:02:35.080> down<00:02:35.470> here

00:02:36.140 --> 00:02:36.150 
only these other devices down here

00:02:36.150 --> 00:02:38.280 
only these other devices down here
hopefully<00:02:37.150> you<00:02:37.450> could<00:02:37.569> see<00:02:37.810> that<00:02:37.930> on<00:02:38.049> camera

00:02:38.280 --> 00:02:38.290 
hopefully you could see that on camera

00:02:38.290 --> 00:02:43.979 
hopefully you could see that on camera
clearly<00:02:41.099> hopefully<00:02:42.099> will<00:02:42.310> auto<00:02:43.239> focus<00:02:43.780> and

00:02:43.979 --> 00:02:43.989 
clearly hopefully will auto focus and

00:02:43.989 --> 00:02:45.360 
clearly hopefully will auto focus and
you<00:02:44.079> could<00:02:44.230> see<00:02:44.410> it<00:02:44.500> but<00:02:45.010> those<00:02:45.190> are<00:02:45.340> the

00:02:45.360 --> 00:02:45.370 
you could see it but those are the

00:02:45.370 --> 00:02:48.300 
you could see it but those are the
results<00:02:45.790> you<00:02:45.880> get<00:02:46.060> um<00:02:46.870> yeah<00:02:47.829> these<00:02:48.040> are<00:02:48.099> very

00:02:48.300 --> 00:02:48.310 
results you get um yeah these are very

00:02:48.310 --> 00:02:51.380 
results you get um yeah these are very
good<00:02:48.489> results<00:02:49.030> top<00:02:49.750> my<00:02:50.380> mouth<00:02:50.560> show<00:02:50.739> how<00:02:50.860> the

00:02:51.380 --> 00:02:51.390 
good results top my mouth show how the

00:02:51.390 --> 00:02:53.819 
good results top my mouth show how the
Snapdragon<00:02:52.390> one<00:02:52.480> will<00:02:52.660> perform<00:02:53.019> but<00:02:53.200> hope<00:02:53.680> you

00:02:53.819 --> 00:02:53.829 
Snapdragon one will perform but hope you

00:02:53.829 --> 00:02:55.710 
Snapdragon one will perform but hope you
could<00:02:54.010> see<00:02:54.160> that<00:02:54.280> some<00:02:54.489> of<00:02:54.610> an<00:02:54.700> interneuron<00:02:55.060> or

00:02:55.710 --> 00:02:55.720 
could see that some of an interneuron or

00:02:55.720 --> 00:02:57.990 
could see that some of an interneuron or
another<00:02:56.049> video<00:02:56.349> I<00:02:56.560> want<00:02:57.519> to<00:02:57.579> take<00:02:57.730> a<00:02:57.760> look<00:02:57.849> at

00:02:57.990 --> 00:02:58.000 
another video I want to take a look at

00:02:58.000 --> 00:03:00.569 
another video I want to take a look at
another<00:02:58.209> benchmark<00:02:58.900> application<00:02:59.620> and<00:03:00.370> take<00:03:00.549> a

00:03:00.569 --> 00:03:00.579 
another benchmark application and take a

00:03:00.579 --> 00:03:04.050 
another benchmark application and take a
look<00:03:00.760> at<00:03:00.940> nana<00:03:01.420> mark<00:03:01.690> 2<00:03:02.400> gonna<00:03:03.400> see<00:03:03.610> how<00:03:03.760> what

00:03:04.050 --> 00:03:04.060 
look at nana mark 2 gonna see how what

00:03:04.060 --> 00:03:07.559 
look at nana mark 2 gonna see how what
kind<00:03:04.269> of<00:03:04.329> frame<00:03:04.629> rate<00:03:04.810> we<00:03:04.930> get<00:03:05.079> with<00:03:05.230> that<00:03:06.569> as

00:03:07.559 --> 00:03:07.569 
kind of frame rate we get with that as

00:03:07.569 --> 00:03:08.970 
kind of frame rate we get with that as
you<00:03:07.810> haven't<00:03:08.049> tested<00:03:08.200> it<00:03:08.470> before<00:03:08.590> so<00:03:08.889> I<00:03:08.920> don't

00:03:08.970 --> 00:03:08.980 
you haven't tested it before so I don't

00:03:08.980 --> 00:03:13.140 
you haven't tested it before so I don't
actually<00:03:09.340> know<00:03:09.609> what<00:03:09.760> kind<00:03:09.910> of<00:03:09.970> results<00:03:12.150> see

00:03:13.140 --> 00:03:13.150 
actually know what kind of results see

00:03:13.150 --> 00:03:25.910 
actually know what kind of results see
down<00:03:13.329> there<00:03:13.480> again<00:03:13.750> about<00:03:13.959> 49<00:03:14.560> 50<00:03:15.069> 51

00:03:29.660 --> 00:03:29.670 
I'm gonna do nun a Mach 1 as well see

00:03:29.670 --> 00:03:39.270 
I'm gonna do nun a Mach 1 as well see
what<00:03:29.819> kind<00:03:30.030> of<00:03:30.090> results<00:03:30.209> we<00:03:30.420> got<00:03:30.569> on<00:03:30.690> that

00:03:39.270 --> 00:03:39.280 

00:03:39.280 --> 00:03:43.240 

okay<00:03:40.280> we<00:03:40.400> got<00:03:40.659> 47.4<00:03:41.659> FPS<00:03:42.439> anyway<00:03:42.859> we<00:03:43.010> get<00:03:43.189> an

00:03:43.240 --> 00:03:43.250 
okay we got 47.4 FPS anyway we get an

00:03:43.250 --> 00:03:45.179 
okay we got 47.4 FPS anyway we get an
idea<00:03:43.489> of<00:03:43.519> what<00:03:43.700> kind<00:03:43.909> of<00:03:43.969> results<00:03:44.120> you<00:03:44.450> get

idea of what kind of results you get

00:03:45.189 --> 00:03:49.000 
idea of what kind of results you get
47.4<00:03:46.510> brings<00:03:47.510> per<00:03:47.629> second<00:03:47.989> when<00:03:48.590> we<00:03:48.799> went<00:03:48.980> to

00:03:49.000 --> 00:03:49.010 
47.4 brings per second when we went to

00:03:49.010 --> 00:03:50.830 
47.4 brings per second when we went to
the<00:03:49.129> next<00:03:49.430> page<00:03:49.640> mark<00:03:49.939> application<00:03:50.510> which<00:03:50.810> is

00:03:50.830 --> 00:03:50.840 
the next page mark application which is

00:03:50.840 --> 00:03:53.979 
the next page mark application which is
quadrant<00:03:51.620> standard<00:03:52.329> we're<00:03:53.329> going<00:03:53.510> to<00:03:53.569> shoot

00:03:53.979 --> 00:03:53.989 
quadrant standard we're going to shoot

00:03:53.989 --> 00:03:55.089 
quadrant standard we're going to shoot
this<00:03:54.079> tough<00:03:54.319> stuff<00:03:54.500> and<00:03:54.650> see<00:03:54.739> what<00:03:54.859> kind<00:03:54.980> of

00:03:55.089 --> 00:03:55.099 
this tough stuff and see what kind of

00:03:55.099 --> 00:03:59.679 
this tough stuff and see what kind of
results<00:03:55.250> we<00:03:55.609> go<00:03:58.150> okay<00:03:59.150> you're<00:03:59.329> going<00:03:59.480> to<00:03:59.569> run

00:03:59.679 --> 00:03:59.689 
results we go okay you're going to run

00:03:59.689 --> 00:04:03.490 
results we go okay you're going to run
the<00:03:59.870> full<00:04:00.079> benchmark<00:04:00.650> I<00:04:02.079> believe<00:04:03.079> an<00:04:03.200> engadget

00:04:03.490 --> 00:04:03.500 
the full benchmark I believe an engadget

00:04:03.500 --> 00:04:06.429 
the full benchmark I believe an engadget
they'll<00:04:03.799> go<00:04:03.920> around<00:04:04.040> just<00:04:05.030> over<00:04:05.290> 4,000<00:04:06.290> I

00:04:06.429 --> 00:04:06.439 
they'll go around just over 4,000 I

00:04:06.439 --> 00:04:08.649 
they'll go around just over 4,000 I
think<00:04:07.129> but<00:04:08.090> we're<00:04:08.180> going<00:04:08.299> to<00:04:08.359> see<00:04:08.450> what<00:04:08.569> kind

00:04:08.649 --> 00:04:08.659 
think but we're going to see what kind

00:04:08.659 --> 00:04:11.259 
think but we're going to see what kind
of<00:04:08.750> results<00:04:08.870> we<00:04:09.139> get<00:04:09.379> with<00:04:09.530> this<00:04:10.269> hopefully

00:04:11.259 --> 00:04:11.269 
of results we get with this hopefully

00:04:11.269 --> 00:04:12.729 
of results we get with this hopefully
it'll<00:04:11.389> be<00:04:11.540> good<00:04:11.689> should<00:04:12.349> be<00:04:12.470> good<00:04:12.590> because

00:04:12.729 --> 00:04:12.739 
it'll be good should be good because

00:04:12.739 --> 00:04:14.979 
it'll be good should be good because
it's<00:04:12.950> gone<00:04:13.099> quad-core<00:04:13.689> processor<00:04:14.689> clocked<00:04:14.840> at

00:04:14.979 --> 00:04:14.989 
it's gone quad-core processor clocked at

00:04:14.989 --> 00:04:17.490 
it's gone quad-core processor clocked at
1.5<00:04:15.530> gigahertz<00:04:15.709> plus<00:04:16.370> an<00:04:16.549> extra<00:04:16.609> course<00:04:17.030> or

00:04:17.490 --> 00:04:17.500 
1.5 gigahertz plus an extra course or

00:04:17.500 --> 00:04:23.560 
1.5 gigahertz plus an extra course or
should<00:04:18.500> be<00:04:18.620> good<00:04:20.799> again<00:04:21.799> about<00:04:22.160> 59<00:04:22.849> 60<00:04:23.360> frames

00:04:23.560 --> 00:04:23.570 
should be good again about 59 60 frames

00:04:23.570 --> 00:04:26.230 
should be good again about 59 60 frames
per<00:04:23.630> second<00:04:24.050> with<00:04:24.139> that<00:04:24.169> image<00:04:24.880> here<00:04:25.880> again

00:04:26.230 --> 00:04:26.240 
per second with that image here again

00:04:26.240 --> 00:04:32.499 
per second with that image here again
about<00:04:26.539> 59<00:04:29.050> 60<00:04:30.580> hovering<00:04:31.580> around<00:04:31.729> that<00:04:32.000> mark<00:04:32.240> so

00:04:32.499 --> 00:04:32.509 
about 59 60 hovering around that mark so

00:04:32.509 --> 00:04:41.350 
about 59 60 hovering around that mark so
looking<00:04:33.440> good<00:04:33.560> so<00:04:33.620> far

00:04:41.350 --> 00:04:41.360 

00:04:41.360 --> 00:04:51.159 

yes<00:04:42.039> 159<00:04:43.090> frames<00:04:44.090> per<00:04:44.270> second<00:04:49.840> 59<00:04:50.840> frames<00:04:51.050> per

00:04:51.159 --> 00:04:51.169 
yes 159 frames per second 59 frames per

00:04:51.169 --> 00:04:52.869 
yes 159 frames per second 59 frames per
second<00:04:51.500> I<00:04:51.560> think<00:04:51.620> this<00:04:51.830> one's<00:04:52.039> been<00:04:52.400> updated

00:04:52.869 --> 00:04:52.879 
second I think this one's been updated

00:04:52.879 --> 00:04:55.240 
second I think this one's been updated
for<00:04:52.909> more<00:04:53.210> echoes<00:04:53.539> as<00:04:53.750> well<00:04:53.930> so<00:04:54.250> should

00:04:55.240 --> 00:04:55.250 
for more echoes as well so should

00:04:55.250 --> 00:04:58.059 
for more echoes as well so should
produce<00:04:55.460> a<00:04:55.819> good<00:04:56.120> result<00:04:56.419> at<00:04:56.539> the<00:04:56.569> end<00:04:57.069> and

00:04:58.059 --> 00:04:58.069 
produce a good result at the end and

00:04:58.069 --> 00:05:02.320 
produce a good result at the end and
that's<00:04:58.849> it<00:05:00.430> see<00:05:01.430> what<00:05:01.550> kind<00:05:01.729> of<00:05:01.759> result<00:05:02.060> we<00:05:02.180> get

00:05:02.320 --> 00:05:02.330 
that's it see what kind of result we get

00:05:02.330 --> 00:05:06.730 
that's it see what kind of result we get
we've<00:05:02.569> got<00:05:04.210> 4359<00:05:05.210> so<00:05:05.629> the<00:05:05.870> results<00:05:06.289> are<00:05:06.379> pretty

00:05:06.730 --> 00:05:06.740 
we've got 4359 so the results are pretty

00:05:06.740 --> 00:05:08.950 
we've got 4359 so the results are pretty
good<00:05:07.009> as<00:05:07.729> you<00:05:07.909> can<00:05:08.060> see<00:05:08.180> compared<00:05:08.569> to<00:05:08.689> that<00:05:08.810> the

00:05:08.950 --> 00:05:08.960 
good as you can see compared to that the

00:05:08.960 --> 00:05:11.350 
good as you can see compared to that the
guys<00:05:09.110> eat<00:05:09.319> a<00:05:09.469> banana<00:05:09.650> kiss<00:05:10.159> as<00:05:10.729> she<00:05:10.789> blows<00:05:11.180> out

00:05:11.350 --> 00:05:11.360 
guys eat a banana kiss as she blows out

guys eat a banana kiss as she blows out
a<00:05:11.389> war<00:05:11.599> very<00:05:11.960> good<00:05:12.169> results<00:05:13.449> so<00:05:14.449> you<00:05:14.509> could<00:05:14.659> get

00:05:15.040 --> 00:05:15.050 
a war very good results so you could get

00:05:15.050 --> 00:05:17.439 
a war very good results so you could get
to<00:05:15.199> see<00:05:15.349> that<00:05:15.529> good<00:05:15.830> results<00:05:16.330> going<00:05:17.330> to

00:05:17.439 --> 00:05:17.449 
to see that good results going to

00:05:17.449 --> 00:05:19.719 
to see that good results going to
another<00:05:17.719> benchmark<00:05:18.650> application<00:05:19.340> and<00:05:19.520> see

00:05:19.719 --> 00:05:19.729 
another benchmark application and see

00:05:19.729 --> 00:05:23.409 
another benchmark application and see
let's<00:05:20.599> go<00:05:20.779> into<00:05:21.139> this<00:05:21.560> one<00:05:22.000> I'm<00:05:23.000> gonna<00:05:23.120> start

00:05:23.409 --> 00:05:23.419 
let's go into this one I'm gonna start

00:05:23.419 --> 00:05:24.610 
let's go into this one I'm gonna start
this<00:05:23.539> up<00:05:23.659> and<00:05:23.779> see<00:05:23.870> what<00:05:23.990> kind<00:05:24.169> of<00:05:24.199> results<00:05:24.379> we

00:05:24.610 --> 00:05:24.620 
this up and see what kind of results we

00:05:24.620 --> 00:05:29.790 
this up and see what kind of results we
go<00:05:24.800> and<00:05:24.949> this<00:05:25.009> as<00:05:25.189> well<00:05:25.539> um<00:05:27.250> just<00:05:28.250> go<00:05:28.490> to<00:05:28.550> test

00:05:29.790 --> 00:05:29.800 
go and this as well um just go to test

00:05:29.800 --> 00:05:37.029 
go and this as well um just go to test
and<00:05:31.539> start<00:05:32.539> the<00:05:32.659> test<00:05:35.379> okay<00:05:36.379> so<00:05:36.439> the<00:05:36.680> test<00:05:36.860> is

00:05:37.029 --> 00:05:37.039 
and start the test okay so the test is

00:05:37.039 --> 00:05:38.589 
and start the test okay so the test is
finished<00:05:37.189> and<00:05:37.520> these<00:05:37.669> are<00:05:37.819> the<00:05:38.000> results<00:05:38.479> are

00:05:38.589 --> 00:05:38.599 
finished and these are the results are

00:05:38.599 --> 00:05:43.089 
finished and these are the results are
got<00:05:39.129> up<00:05:40.129> there's<00:05:40.400> 10,000<00:05:41.289> 120<00:05:42.289> those<00:05:42.949> are<00:05:43.069> the

00:05:43.089 --> 00:05:43.099 
got up there's 10,000 120 those are the

00:05:43.099 --> 00:05:45.029 
got up there's 10,000 120 those are the
results<00:05:43.520> you<00:05:43.610> see<00:05:44.000> the<00:05:44.090> results<00:05:44.419> for<00:05:44.449> the<00:05:44.629> ram

00:05:45.029 --> 00:05:45.039
