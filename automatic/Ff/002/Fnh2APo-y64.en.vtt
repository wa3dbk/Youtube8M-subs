ready<00:01:34.079> to<00:01:34.200> go<00:01:34.290> still<00:01:35.040> kissing<00:01:35.250> some<00:01:35.490> water

00:01:35.660 --> 00:01:35.670 
ready to go still kissing some water

00:01:35.670 --> 00:01:38.330 
ready to go still kissing some water
10-15<00:01:36.570> minutes<00:01:36.869> or<00:01:36.930> so<00:01:37.079> just<00:01:37.380> let<00:01:38.009> it<00:01:38.130> get<00:01:38.220> all

00:01:38.330 --> 00:01:38.340 
10-15 minutes or so just let it get all

00:01:38.340 --> 00:01:39.109 
10-15 minutes or so just let it get all
incorporated

00:01:39.109 --> 00:01:39.119 
incorporated

00:01:39.119 --> 00:01:41.060 
incorporated
let<00:01:39.420> it<00:01:39.509> get<00:01:39.600> soaked<00:01:39.900> nice<00:01:40.200> get<00:01:40.590> all<00:01:40.680> the<00:01:40.829> extra

00:01:41.060 --> 00:01:41.070 
let it get soaked nice get all the extra

00:01:41.070 --> 00:01:42.440 
let it get soaked nice get all the extra
air<00:01:41.220> bubbles<00:01:41.610> anything<00:01:41.880> else<00:01:42.000> that<00:01:42.150> may<00:01:42.240> be<00:01:42.299> in

00:01:42.440 --> 00:01:42.450 
air bubbles anything else that may be in

00:01:42.450 --> 00:01:44.090 
air bubbles anything else that may be in
here<00:01:42.570> out<00:01:42.810> it<00:01:43.409> just<00:01:43.590> speeds<00:01:43.770> up<00:01:43.920> the<00:01:44.070> process

00:01:44.090 --> 00:01:44.100 
here out it just speeds up the process

00:01:44.100 --> 00:01:46.670 
here out it just speeds up the process
of<00:01:44.790> getting<00:01:45.299> to<00:01:45.450> use<00:01:45.689> the<00:01:45.810> filter<00:01:46.110> and<00:01:46.409> it

00:01:46.670 --> 00:01:46.680 
of getting to use the filter and it

00:01:46.680 --> 00:01:48.590 
of getting to use the filter and it
takes<00:01:46.829> the<00:01:46.920> less<00:01:47.100> time<00:01:47.369> so<00:01:47.549> if<00:01:47.610> you<00:01:47.640> flushing

00:01:48.590 --> 00:01:48.600 
takes the less time so if you flushing

00:01:48.600 --> 00:01:50.480 
takes the less time so if you flushing
the<00:01:48.720> water<00:01:48.750> through<00:01:49.200> the<00:01:49.290> filter<00:01:49.439> before<00:01:50.399> it's

00:01:50.480 --> 00:01:50.490 
the water through the filter before it's

00:01:50.490 --> 00:01:52.069 
the water through the filter before it's
ready<00:01:50.579> to<00:01:50.700> drink<00:01:50.790> okay<00:01:51.360> so<00:01:51.659> still<00:01:51.810> get<00:01:51.990> really

00:01:52.069 --> 00:01:52.079 
ready to drink okay so still get really

00:01:52.079 --> 00:01:55.399 
ready to drink okay so still get really
well<00:01:52.970> once<00:01:53.970> that<00:01:54.119> is<00:01:54.210> good<00:01:54.360> pump<00:01:55.170> it<00:01:55.259> out<00:01:55.320> of

00:01:55.399 --> 00:01:55.409 
well once that is good pump it out of

00:01:55.409 --> 00:01:57.350 
well once that is good pump it out of
the<00:01:55.470> water<00:01:55.770> push<00:01:56.250> that<00:01:56.430> gasket<00:01:56.670> all<00:01:57.000> over<00:01:57.180> on

down a little tiger okay once you got
that<00:02:28.280> good<00:02:28.490> to<00:02:28.580> go<00:02:29.860> reservoir<00:02:30.860> back<00:02:31.040> in<00:02:31.280> and

00:02:31.840 --> 00:02:31.850 
that good to go reservoir back in and

00:02:31.850 --> 00:02:33.640 
that good to go reservoir back in and
then<00:02:31.970> it's<00:02:32.120> just<00:02:32.240> simply<00:02:32.510> a<00:02:32.540> matter<00:02:32.600> of<00:02:32.870> fill

00:02:53.080 --> 00:02:53.090 
could even not load it in the picture

00:02:53.090 --> 00:02:55.390 
could even not load it in the picture
itself<00:02:53.420> if<00:02:53.750> you<00:02:54.020> don't<00:02:54.200> want<00:02:54.410> you<00:02:55.160> can<00:02:55.280> just

to<00:04:24.120> be<00:04:24.180> changed<00:04:24.420> so<00:04:24.750> I<00:04:25.440> think<00:04:25.620> that's<00:04:25.860> it<00:04:26.010> we

00:04:26.810 --> 00:04:26.820 
to be changed so I think that's it we

00:04:26.820 --> 00:04:28.010 
to be changed so I think that's it we
can<00:04:26.940> do<00:04:27.000> another<00:04:27.150> video<00:04:27.300> shortly<00:04:27.690> with

00:04:28.010 --> 00:04:28.020 
can do another video shortly with

00:04:28.020 --> 00:04:29.540 
can do another video shortly with
showing<00:04:28.530> you<00:04:28.680> the<00:04:28.770> performance<00:04:29.250> so<00:04:29.370> check

00:04:29.540 --> 00:04:29.550 
showing you the performance so check

00:04:29.550 --> 00:04:31.670 
showing you the performance so check
that<00:04:29.700> out<00:04:29.850> as<00:04:29.970> well<00:04:30.000> get<00:04:30.720> an<00:04:30.840> educated<00:04:31.230> idea<00:04:31.620> of

00:04:31.670 --> 00:04:31.680 
that out as well get an educated idea of

00:04:31.680 --> 00:04:33.470 
that out as well get an educated idea of
how<00:04:31.800> the<00:04:31.860> water<00:04:32.130> runs<00:04:32.340> through<00:04:32.430> when<00:04:33.240> we<00:04:33.330> look

00:04:33.470 --> 00:04:33.480 
how the water runs through when we look

00:04:33.480 --> 00:04:34.670 
how the water runs through when we look
at<00:04:33.540> on<00:04:33.660> the<00:04:33.720> front<00:04:33.930> side<00:04:34.110> of<00:04:34.140> the<00:04:34.260> backside

00:04:34.670 --> 00:04:34.680 
at on the front side of the backside

00:04:34.680 --> 00:04:36.800 
at on the front side of the backside
performance<00:04:35.250> standpoint<00:04:35.430> and<00:04:36.240> we'll<00:04:36.630> go<00:04:36.720> from

00:04:36.800 --> 00:04:36.810 
performance standpoint and we'll go from

00:04:36.810 --> 00:04:38.900 
performance standpoint and we'll go from
there<00:04:36.900> let's<00:04:37.590> go<00:04:37.650> give<00:04:37.770> any<00:04:37.890> questions<00:04:38.250> thanks

00:04:38.900 --> 00:04:38.910 
there let's go give any questions thanks

00:04:38.910 --> 00:04:41.090 
there let's go give any questions thanks
