bounce to have the sweaty team at the

00:04:19.680 --> 00:04:21.830 
bounce to have the sweaty team at the
back<00:04:19.890> it<00:04:20.489> would<00:04:20.640> push<00:04:20.910> off<00:04:21.090> expensive<00:04:21.660> teams

00:04:21.830 --> 00:04:21.840

00:04:29.260 --> 00:04:29.270 
kind of destroy it at times but this was

00:04:29.270 --> 00:04:30.730 
kind of destroy it at times but this was
a<00:04:29.300> right<00:04:29.630> way<00:04:29.780> to<00:04:29.810> go<00:04:29.960> because<00:04:30.170> he<00:04:30.410> can<00:04:30.560> push

00:04:30.730 --> 00:04:30.740 
a right way to go because he can push

00:04:30.740 --> 00:04:32.170 
a right way to go because he can push
off<00:04:30.890> expensive<00:04:31.400> teams<00:04:31.580> and<00:04:31.760> battle<00:04:32.060> it<00:04:32.120> out
