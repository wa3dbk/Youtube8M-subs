done<00:00:33.960> in<00:00:34.110> this<00:00:34.290> game<00:00:34.500> so<00:00:34.860> that's<00:00:35.280> the<00:00:35.640> kind<00:00:35.940> of

00:00:35.959 --> 00:00:35.969 
done in this game so that's the kind of

00:00:35.969 --> 00:00:37.940 
done in this game so that's the kind of
idea<00:00:36.329> that<00:00:36.360> I<00:00:36.540> came<00:00:36.600> up<00:00:36.809> with<00:00:37.110> because<00:00:37.290> if

00:00:37.940 --> 00:00:37.950 
idea that I came up with because if

00:00:37.950 --> 00:00:40.100 
idea that I came up with because if
they're<00:00:38.190> trying<00:00:38.430> to<00:00:38.520> go<00:00:38.640> for<00:00:38.850> that<00:00:39.110> they

00:00:40.100 --> 00:00:40.110 
they're trying to go for that they

00:00:40.110 --> 00:00:42.610 
they're trying to go for that they
should<00:00:40.320> also<00:00:40.559> add<00:00:40.890> in<00:00:41.100> chakra<00:00:42.000> nature

00:00:42.610 --> 00:00:42.620 
should also add in chakra nature

00:00:42.620 --> 00:00:45.500 
should also add in chakra nature
superiority<00:00:43.620> when<00:00:44.340> it<00:00:44.460> comes<00:00:44.700> to<00:00:44.879> clashing<00:00:45.329> to

cancels out and nothing happens but what

00:00:58.289 --> 00:01:00.290 
cancels out and nothing happens but what
if<00:00:58.410> we<00:00:58.530> actually<00:00:58.649> got<00:00:58.949> advantage<00:00:59.670> for<00:01:00.059> the

00:01:00.290 --> 00:01:00.300 
if we actually got advantage for the

00:01:00.300 --> 00:01:02.479 
if we actually got advantage for the
water<00:01:00.570> style<00:01:00.870> since<00:01:01.320> it's<00:01:01.829> actually

00:01:02.479 --> 00:01:02.489 
water style since it's actually

00:01:02.489 --> 00:01:04.850 
water style since it's actually
overpowers<00:01:03.480> the<00:01:03.629> fire<00:01:03.840> style<00:01:04.170> I<00:01:04.350> know<00:01:04.379> there's

00:01:04.850 --> 00:01:04.860 
overpowers the fire style I know there's

00:01:04.860 --> 00:01:06.770 
overpowers the fire style I know there's
some<00:01:05.040> discrepancies<00:01:05.790> in<00:01:05.820> that<00:01:06.150> as<00:01:06.330> in<00:01:06.600> like

00:01:06.770 --> 00:01:06.780 
some discrepancies in that as in like

00:01:06.780 --> 00:01:09.410 
some discrepancies in that as in like
kekkei<00:01:07.530> genkai<00:01:07.560> stuff<00:01:08.430> like<00:01:08.760> wood<00:01:09.150> style

00:01:09.410 --> 00:01:09.420 
kekkei genkai stuff like wood style

00:01:09.420 --> 00:01:12.140 
kekkei genkai stuff like wood style
storm<00:01:10.170> style<00:01:10.500> lava<00:01:10.799> style<00:01:11.100> but<00:01:11.400> pretty<00:01:11.970> sure

00:01:12.140 --> 00:01:12.150 
storm style lava style but pretty sure

00:01:12.150 --> 00:01:13.850 
storm style lava style but pretty sure
they<00:01:12.330> could<00:01:12.510> kind<00:01:12.869> of<00:01:13.020> figure<00:01:13.200> something<00:01:13.740> out

00:01:13.850 --> 00:01:13.860 
they could kind of figure something out

00:01:13.860 --> 00:01:16.730 
they could kind of figure something out
in<00:01:14.040> terms<00:01:14.250> of<00:01:14.490> reviewing<00:01:15.479> how<00:01:15.900> much<00:01:16.170> elements

00:01:16.730 --> 00:01:16.740 
in terms of reviewing how much elements

00:01:16.740 --> 00:01:19.100 
in terms of reviewing how much elements
of<00:01:16.860> wood<00:01:17.100> and<00:01:17.369> how<00:01:17.820> powerful<00:01:18.420> it<00:01:18.689> would<00:01:18.780> be<00:01:18.900> but

00:01:19.100 --> 00:01:19.110 
of wood and how powerful it would be but

00:01:19.110 --> 00:01:21.170 
of wood and how powerful it would be but
other<00:01:19.350> than<00:01:19.590> that<00:01:19.680> it<00:01:20.070> seems<00:01:20.369> like<00:01:20.430> a<00:01:20.520> solid

00:01:21.170 --> 00:01:21.180 
other than that it seems like a solid

00:01:21.180 --> 00:01:23.030 
other than that it seems like a solid
idea<00:01:21.659> that<00:01:21.840> they<00:01:21.930> could<00:01:21.990> just<00:01:22.380> throw<00:01:22.619> in<00:01:22.799> there

00:01:23.030 --> 00:01:23.040 
idea that they could just throw in there

00:01:23.040 --> 00:01:24.859 
idea that they could just throw in there
to<00:01:23.430> make<00:01:23.610> the<00:01:23.729> game<00:01:23.909> more<00:01:23.939> competitive<00:01:24.689> but

00:01:24.859 --> 00:01:24.869 
to make the game more competitive but

00:01:24.869 --> 00:01:27.080 
to make the game more competitive but
they're<00:01:25.200> kind<00:01:25.470> of<00:01:25.530> would<00:01:25.740> be<00:01:25.860> some<00:01:26.090> o-p-s

00:01:27.080 --> 00:01:27.090 
they're kind of would be some o-p-s

00:01:27.090 --> 00:01:29.270 
they're kind of would be some o-p-s
users<00:01:27.990> because<00:01:28.380> some<00:01:28.560> people<00:01:28.799> have<00:01:28.920> really

00:01:29.270 --> 00:01:29.280 
users because some people have really

00:01:29.280 --> 00:01:31.999 
users because some people have really
ope<00:01:29.700> elements<00:01:30.390> but<00:01:30.659> I'm<00:01:31.470> sure<00:01:31.680> they<00:01:31.860> could

00:01:31.999 --> 00:01:32.009 
ope elements but I'm sure they could

00:01:32.009 --> 00:01:34.310 
ope elements but I'm sure they could
probably<00:01:32.189> figure<00:01:32.490> out<00:01:32.579> a<00:01:32.640> way<00:01:32.880> to<00:01:33.329> get<00:01:33.990> over

00:01:34.310 --> 00:01:34.320 
probably figure out a way to get over

00:01:34.320 --> 00:01:37.280 
probably figure out a way to get over
that<00:01:34.500> and<00:01:34.820> with<00:01:35.820> that<00:01:36.119> I<00:01:36.360> just<00:01:36.659> wanted<00:01:36.960> to<00:01:37.110> say

00:01:37.280 --> 00:01:37.290 
that and with that I just wanted to say

00:01:37.290 --> 00:01:38.810 
that and with that I just wanted to say
that<00:01:37.530> for<00:01:37.860> those<00:01:38.009> of<00:01:38.070> you<00:01:38.340> who<00:01:38.490> are<00:01:38.610> new<00:01:38.790> to

00:01:38.810 --> 00:01:38.820 
that for those of you who are new to

00:01:38.820 --> 00:01:40.370 
that for those of you who are new to
classes<00:01:39.299> I<00:01:39.420> also<00:01:39.570> came<00:01:39.810> up<00:01:39.930> with<00:01:39.990> a<00:01:40.079> new<00:01:40.229> idea

00:01:40.370 --> 00:01:40.380 
classes I also came up with a new idea

00:01:40.380 --> 00:01:43.280
