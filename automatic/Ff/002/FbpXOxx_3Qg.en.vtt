 they are more popular at all the Grands Prix Red UL 

00:00:58.830 --> 00:01:00.060
 It's a shame 

00:01:00.060 --> 00:01:02.680
 Stadler into the game export engine 

00:01:02.680 --> 00:01:04.980
 as with other balance never done 

00:01:04.980 --> 00:01:07.980
 everything is okay is comprehensive 

00:01:10.810 --> 00:01:13.810
 the idea is coming 

00:01:26.520 --> 00:01:29.520
 May 

00:01:56.120 --> 00:02:00.510
 why it is on the market Mark van Bommel good evening at a spontaneously one to one

 as well as 

00:02:07.840 --> 00:02:10.049
 unfortunately you have to say 

00:02:10.049 --> 00:02:13.369
 expect 

00:02:13.369 --> 00:02:16.129
 Mortara 

00:02:16.129 --> 00:02:19.419

 there are four walls 

00:02:39.219 --> 00:02:41.369
 and only on 

00:02:41.369 --> 00:02:42.450
 and not it 

00:02:42.450 --> 00:02:44.239
 in retrospect 

00:02:44.239 --> 00:02:45.379
 given to it 

00:02:45.379 --> 00:02:46.590

00:02:57.489 --> 00:03:00.489
 want here 

00:03:01.199 --> 00:03:03.719
 I 

00:03:03.719 --> 00:03:08.119
 my knees go I am Dr 

00:03:09.039 --> 00:03:13.809
 Bremen dapd-nrd IbbenbÃ¼ren says her natural drive 

00:03:13.809 --> 00:03:16.809
 and of course find 

00:03:17.829 --> 00:03:19.050
 the businessman 

00:03:19.050 --> 00:03:21.800
 What they say is apparently prevails over wires are the mega-trend 

00:03:21.800 --> 00:03:24.219
 health 

00:03:24.219 --> 00:03:27.879
 buy loyal natural products today though the boom of organic products 

00:03:27.879 --> 00:03:29.579
 always strong last years 

00:03:29.579 --> 00:03:31.279
 and all the action 

00:03:31.279 --> 00:03:33.159
 and I said last year 

00:03:33.159 --> 00:03:37.169
 Of course I can say a mineral water of course 

00:03:37.169 --> 00:03:40.529
 where the minorities are bubbling naturally solved in the water 

00:03:40.529 --> 00:03:43.799
 as with the 2 2-draw since there is actually prohibited 

00:03:43.799 --> 00:03:47.169
 that fits in well with this trend health naturalness 

00:03:47.169 --> 00:03:50.219
 so Beller Fontanes comes from a source it is not up to now 

00:03:50.219 --> 00:03:53.639
 added to the calcium and that it is natural source what is that special 

00:03:54.609 --> 00:03:57.139
 yes, especially in this day and age 

00:03:57.139 --> 00:03:58.700
 in sports as well as in the market 

00:03:58.700 --> 00:04:01.869
 only one thing will support top performance 

00:04:01.869 --> 00:04:04.409
 and he learns to specify the single measure 

00:04:04.409 --> 00:04:06.969
 with and unpleasant as banal calcium 

00:04:06.969 --> 00:04:09.879
 in Bellach peak in Germany with six necessarily from 

00:04:09.879 --> 00:04:10.769
 provider 

00:04:10.769 --> 00:04:13.079
 and also with this Spitzner 

00:04:13.079 --> 00:04:16.359
 beautified and brands because women want to bring more 

00:04:16.919 --> 00:04:20.409
 does one need so much calcium at all? 

00:04:20.409 --> 00:04:24.799
 at blauworld lightest Ralf most available is Calcio with 1 2 was 

00:04:25.330 --> 00:04:26.669
 two kilograms 

00:04:26.669 --> 00:04:29.159
 we have to be a game 

00:04:29.159 --> 00:04:31.539
 around 1000 were milligrams 

00:04:31.539 --> 00:04:33.120
 to Fulda with 

00:04:33.120 --> 00:04:35.599
 who keeps the bone mass 

00:04:35.599 --> 00:04:39.449
 and percent in dispute need and Hahn is not two songs and Horkheimer is not 

00:04:39.449 --> 00:04:41.930
 she had chatted on too 

00:04:41.930 --> 00:04:44.999
 what the Erfurtians at Wheeler Fontanes 

00:04:44.999 --> 00:04:48.309
 the report was awesome the only thing are the portals to mineral water 

00:04:48.309 --> 00:04:50.279
 and ice cream in the mineral water area 

00:04:50.279 --> 00:04:52.909
 therefore no ethanol calories are implied 

00:04:52.909 --> 00:04:55.529
 the new industrial area sadder is important 

00:04:55.529 --> 00:04:59.580
 and if we talk about our ability will continue to do local alongside 

00:04:59.580 --> 00:05:02.909
 if then already if he tracks much stronger before that now 

00:05:02.909 --> 00:05:04.349
 also unde 

00:05:04.349 --> 00:05:08.330
 Keilson pure water is also that the bioavailability is much better 

00:05:08.330 --> 00:05:10.370
 means the choir starts it easier 

00:05:10.370 --> 00:05:13.639
 The share we rated belongs to me, I was just too 

00:05:13.639 --> 00:05:17.040
 but the usability narrowed down by NATO's absentee voting can do it 

00:05:17.039 --> 00:05:18.069
 addressed 

00:05:18.069 --> 00:05:21.520
 Nevertheless, it is also healthy to bring but cold water brings water 

00:05:21.520 --> 00:05:25.889
 Dike more cold previously in the body than than with each other products 

00:05:25.889 --> 00:05:28.389
 what else you read recently a study but to me too 

00:05:28.389 --> 00:05:29.439
 interesting was 

00:05:29.439 --> 00:05:32.669
 same subject always still mineral water or 

00:05:32.669 --> 00:05:35.919
 because ahlhaus' with carbonic acid which is better so yes 

00:05:35.919 --> 00:05:38.020
 decided right here by the water 

00:05:38.020 --> 00:05:41.070
 with a little carbonic something to enforce in which the Chris 

00:05:41.069 --> 00:05:45.210
 Option part of the carbonic acid coupes offers OCZ and calcium though 

00:05:45.210 --> 00:05:46.150
 gate 

00:05:46.150 --> 00:05:49.250
 and that's why we decided to go out and get a little better 

00:05:49.250 --> 00:05:53.190
 mineral water type diversity to the estate of Fortis beats as 

00:05:53.190 --> 00:05:54.809
 silent Waters 

00:05:54.809 --> 00:05:57.739
 Femininity domingues little carbonation game between fresher he 

00:05:57.739 --> 00:06:00.809
 has now been in the lead of secondary injury or century

 Ettinger Panamera Zermatt sat 

00:06:03.599 --> 00:06:05.589
 too much 

00:06:05.589 --> 00:06:07.849
 win for many customers 

00:06:07.849 --> 00:06:10.870
 minor accidents at s04 more is still there 

00:06:11.629 --> 00:06:17.180
 No, actually some say that some websites have been stolen 

00:06:17.180 --> 00:06:20.219
 in other respects 

00:06:20.219 --> 00:06:23.710
 in his this class I think it already has something 

00:06:23.710 --> 00:06:25.969
 the curves of a woman 

00:06:25.969 --> 00:06:27.409

00:06:36.909 --> 00:06:39.020
 APA 

00:06:39.020 --> 00:06:40.360
 what do you have to say about that 

00:06:40.360 --> 00:06:42.240
 only to initiate 

00:06:42.240 --> 00:06:46.159
 Contador he covers all relatively no longer grant

00:06:53.990 --> 00:06:57.780
 what would you want to stop over and over again except that it was despite 

00:06:57.780 --> 00:07:00.189
 Dallas and Arnesen are partners 

00:07:00.189 --> 00:07:03.189

 IVG win the actual message no
