your bike my guys and back just from

00:04:53.800 --> 00:04:55.529 
your bike my guys and back just from
washing<00:04:54.160> it<00:04:54.280> when<00:04:54.580> I<00:04:54.610> was<00:04:54.789> testing<00:04:55.270> it<00:04:55.389> I've

00:04:55.529 --> 00:04:55.539 
washing it when I was testing it I've

00:04:55.539 --> 00:04:58.560 
washing it when I was testing it I've
used<00:04:56.169> it<00:04:56.560> for<00:04:56.680> about<00:04:56.710> a<00:04:57.130> week<00:04:57.490> two<00:04:58.210> weeks<00:04:58.240> now

00:04:58.560 --> 00:04:58.570 
used it for about a week two weeks now

00:04:58.570 --> 00:05:01.379 
used it for about a week two weeks now
I've<00:04:58.780> noticed<00:04:59.650> that<00:05:00.160> when<00:05:00.310> you<00:05:00.520> drinking<00:05:01.270> it

00:05:01.379 --> 00:05:01.389 
I've noticed that when you drinking it

00:05:01.389 --> 00:05:03.090 
I've noticed that when you drinking it
you<00:05:01.419> can't<00:05:01.840> drink<00:05:02.139> like<00:05:02.350> a<00:05:02.500> normal<00:05:02.830> drink

00:05:03.090 --> 00:05:03.100 
you can't drink like a normal drink

00:05:03.100 --> 00:05:05.159 
you can't drink like a normal drink
because<00:05:03.370> when<00:05:03.550> you<00:05:03.669> put<00:05:03.910> your<00:05:03.940> lips<00:05:04.270> over

00:05:05.159 --> 00:05:05.169 
because when you put your lips over

00:05:05.169 --> 00:05:07.950 
because when you put your lips over
there<00:05:05.350> a<00:05:05.620> hole<00:05:06.039> your<00:05:06.370> lips<00:05:06.639> block<00:05:07.240> the<00:05:07.810> water

00:05:07.950 --> 00:05:07.960 
there a hole your lips block the water

00:05:07.960 --> 00:05:10.230 
there a hole your lips block the water
passing<00:05:08.950> through<00:05:08.979> we<00:05:09.460> have<00:05:09.580> to<00:05:09.700> look<00:05:10.030> after

00:05:10.230 --> 00:05:10.240 
passing through we have to look after

00:05:10.240 --> 00:05:12.690 
passing through we have to look after
open<00:05:10.720> your<00:05:10.810> mouth<00:05:10.840> near<00:05:11.530> enough<00:05:11.740> pour<00:05:12.010> in<00:05:12.310> so<00:05:12.669> I

open your mouth near enough pour in so I

00:05:12.700 --> 00:05:13.890 
open your mouth near enough pour in so I
think<00:05:12.789> you<00:05:13.030> could<00:05:13.270> probably<00:05:13.330> have<00:05:13.630> a<00:05:13.690> bigger

00:05:13.890 --> 00:05:13.900 
think you could probably have a bigger

00:05:13.900 --> 00:05:15.750 
think you could probably have a bigger
hole<00:05:14.200> to<00:05:14.590> make<00:05:14.680> it<00:05:14.830> easiest<00:05:15.100> to<00:05:15.220> drink<00:05:15.520> I'll

00:05:15.750 --> 00:05:15.760
