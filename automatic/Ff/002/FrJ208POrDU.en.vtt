particular tune you're just getting
ready<00:01:40.210> for<00:01:40.480> altitudes<00:01:41.230> a<00:01:41.470> lot<00:01:42.040> of<00:01:42.220> twists<00:01:42.490> of

00:01:42.660 --> 00:01:42.670 
ready for altitudes a lot of twists of

00:01:42.670 --> 00:01:46.500 
ready for altitudes a lot of twists of
that<00:01:42.850> nature<00:01:43.260> ha<00:01:44.260> then<00:01:44.950> you<00:01:45.070> do<00:01:45.220> it<00:01:45.250> on<00:01:45.520> another

00:01:46.500 --> 00:01:46.510 
that nature ha then you do it on another

00:01:46.510 --> 00:01:51.260 
that nature ha then you do it on another
pair<00:01:46.840> of<00:01:46.990> nodes<00:01:47.200> first<00:01:47.560> and<00:01:47.830> third<00:01:48.040> strings

00:02:18.339 --> 00:02:18.349 
isolating the role to get it going

00:02:18.349 --> 00:02:20.530 
isolating the role to get it going
faster<00:02:18.950> get<00:02:19.129> a<00:02:19.159> conviction<00:02:19.640> and<00:02:20.000> please<00:02:20.299> you

thing I could coax a song out of that
exercise<00:02:41.330> oh<00:02:42.610> and<00:02:43.610> so<00:02:44.480> that's<00:02:44.720> you<00:02:45.590> know

00:02:45.640 --> 00:02:45.650 
exercise oh and so that's you know

00:02:49.180 --> 00:02:49.190 
choose another liquid do the same thing

00:02:49.190 --> 00:02:51.940 
choose another liquid do the same thing
is<00:02:49.900> they<00:02:50.900> all<00:02:51.080> have<00:02:51.260> to<00:02:51.410> be<00:02:51.440> on<00:02:51.680> automatic

00:02:51.940 --> 00:02:51.950 
is they all have to be on automatic

00:02:54.130 --> 00:02:54.140 
pilot you can't be thinking about these

00:02:54.140 --> 00:02:56.500 
pilot you can't be thinking about these
initial<00:02:54.620> fingers<00:02:54.980> and<00:02:55.550> to<00:02:55.730> call<00:02:55.940> it<00:02:56.120> up<00:02:56.240> like<00:02:56.480> a

00:02:56.500 --> 00:02:56.510 
initial fingers and to call it up like a

00:02:56.510 --> 00:03:07.080 
initial fingers and to call it up like a
subroutine<00:02:57.020> it<00:02:57.860> executes

there's a hard part take a pattern and
fan<00:03:14.920> it<00:03:14.950> out<00:03:15.250> into<00:03:15.519> a<00:03:15.700> series<00:03:16.209> of<00:03:16.239> problems<00:03:16.870> one

00:03:17.720 --> 00:03:17.730 
fan it out into a series of problems one

00:03:17.730 --> 00:03:22.700 
fan it out into a series of problems one
place<00:03:18.730> onto

00:03:22.700 --> 00:03:22.710 

00:03:22.710 --> 00:03:27.030
