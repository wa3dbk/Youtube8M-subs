00:00:10.080 --> 00:00:15.690
 office and guests came running to us 

00:00:13.410 --> 00:00:18.330
 alfia started asking a question about 

00:00:15.690 --> 00:00:21.150
 blush so we decided to write a small 

00:00:18.330 --> 00:00:23.039
 video form less master classes 

00:00:21.150 --> 00:00:25.310
 why use blush like blush 

00:00:23.039 --> 00:00:28.800
 choose how to apply 

00:00:25.310 --> 00:00:31.170
 this is your cafe bars buy everything 

00:00:28.800 --> 00:00:33.180
 hi I was very interested in the question 

00:00:31.170 --> 00:00:35.850
 about how to make blush and in general 

00:00:33.180 --> 00:00:38.700
 why do they need just my experience 

00:00:35.850 --> 00:00:41.750
 not always better than good joyful then 

00:00:38.700 --> 00:00:44.610
 there is marfusha and fairy tales 

00:00:41.750 --> 00:00:47.100
 their cabin knew how even fun 

00:00:44.610 --> 00:00:48.870
 things should not really want here 

00:00:47.100 --> 00:00:51.989
 I hope that the light does not tell and 

00:00:48.870 --> 00:00:52.710
 will show well now tell and 

00:00:51.989 --> 00:00:57.360
 show 

00:00:52.710 --> 00:00:58.500
 and so okay Armenians are used to 

00:00:57.360 --> 00:01:01.590
 to model 

00:00:58.500 --> 00:01:03.390
 oval face and blush very well 

00:01:01.590 --> 00:01:05.909
 lighted up to the face and generally 

00:01:03.390 --> 00:01:08.520
 when u strive to make natural 

00:01:05.909 --> 00:01:10.750
 makeup for example you do not want can not 

00:01:08.520 --> 00:01:12.760
 use mascara lose 

00:01:10.750 --> 00:01:16.920
 bomann and so on the corners are still 

00:01:12.760 --> 00:01:16.920
 apply a fresher healthy complexion 

00:01:17.700 --> 00:01:23.280
 what kind of mating do we have here 

00:01:21.130 --> 00:01:27.490
 Sofia is tanned after Issyk-Kul 

00:01:23.280 --> 00:01:29.950
 her face is so warm 

00:01:27.490 --> 00:01:32.640
 we select blush more with a warm shade 

00:01:29.950 --> 00:01:36.100
 for example it is warm beige 

00:01:32.640 --> 00:01:38.200
 light beige there salmon and you and then 

00:01:36.100 --> 00:01:41.260
 no yes if we assume you would have 

00:01:38.200 --> 00:01:44.080
 cold skin tone for example scientific 

00:01:41.260 --> 00:01:46.690
 pink or blend so bluish 

00:01:44.080 --> 00:01:50.710
 subtone then there is truth you beat 

00:01:46.690 --> 00:01:52.860
 shades cool for example it's pink 

00:01:50.710 --> 00:01:56.070
 light pink 

00:01:52.860 --> 00:02:00.650
 that there are such cool shades and 

00:01:56.070 --> 00:02:00.650
 so thats so comfortable 

00:02:00.810 --> 00:02:06.780
 thing three shades of blush for any occasion 

00:02:04.500 --> 00:02:08.369
 life and now we are interested in exactly 

00:02:06.780 --> 00:02:12.300
 warm shade of blush 

00:02:08.369 --> 00:02:15.959
 warm beige and so take capturing 

00:02:12.300 --> 00:02:17.819
 shake lightly with a brush now 

00:02:15.959 --> 00:02:20.519
 another question where to put 

00:02:17.819 --> 00:02:25.950
 the fact is that we have on face 

00:02:20.519 --> 00:02:33.239
 blade of the map so so a little bit freed 

00:02:25.950 --> 00:02:35.610
 need hair we stand buying here 

00:02:33.239 --> 00:02:37.650
 if boredom appears on the face , then blush 

00:02:35.610 --> 00:02:39.980
 we put it on the protruding part 

00:02:37.650 --> 00:02:42.930
 faces to level off 

00:02:39.980 --> 00:02:46.739
 if we have a school on the face at all like 

00:02:42.930 --> 00:02:48.260
 there is no such thing then we put under on the go 

00:02:46.739 --> 00:02:51.030
 zygomatic hollow 

00:02:48.260 --> 00:02:52.290
 so and imagine if we are to you now 

00:02:51.030 --> 00:02:54.920
 court will apply to 

00:02:52.290 --> 00:02:58.019
 visually learn from you even more 

00:02:54.920 --> 00:03:00.299
 that's why our tasks here are with a friend 

00:02:58.019 --> 00:03:03.599
 alleviate the day here we put 

00:03:00.299 --> 00:03:05.940
 dented and very well shaded 

00:03:03.599 --> 00:03:07.620
 Our main task is what to blush 

00:03:05.940 --> 00:03:10.370
 have you seen marfush 

00:03:07.620 --> 00:03:13.739
 and to look absolutely natural 

00:03:10.370 --> 00:03:16.550
 here it is light so ruddy should 

00:03:13.739 --> 00:03:19.670
 get and also you one tricky 

00:03:16.550 --> 00:03:24.260
 tell makeup artists there is such a rule 2 

00:03:19.670 --> 00:03:26.780
 + 2 what is it like Putin is closer to the nose 

00:03:24.260 --> 00:03:30.200
 we should not wear closer than two 

00:03:26.780 --> 00:03:35.200
 finger laws are sweet here is your division 

00:03:30.200 --> 00:03:39.050
 Blush should end and not see 

00:03:35.200 --> 00:03:43.130
 two fingers from the upper lip here do 

00:03:39.050 --> 00:03:45.350
 same if you cross this line at you 

00:03:43.130 --> 00:03:48.490
 turn out to be closed in face a little bit 

00:03:45.350 --> 00:03:50.900
 therefore put it and worth doing 

00:03:48.490 --> 00:03:52.090
 We follow this rule and we will look 

00:03:50.900 --> 00:03:58.670
 yourself naturally 

00:03:52.090 --> 00:04:02.120
 agreed of course so well as the second 

00:03:58.670 --> 00:04:05.290
 Try it yourself now ! 

00:04:02.120 --> 00:04:05.290
 rules and on 

00:04:07.120 --> 00:04:10.120
 leveled 

00:04:13.300 --> 00:04:21.400
 I also had this show people 

00:04:17.260 --> 00:04:22.620
 closer your face here is the moment all the same 

00:04:21.400 --> 00:04:25.780
 refresh and 

00:04:22.620 --> 00:04:28.660
 considered as well emphasizes the fact your 

00:04:25.780 --> 00:04:31.570
 postponed until the name of years is not such a problem 

00:04:28.660 --> 00:04:34.110
 speaks for himself need to put gur 

00:04:31.570 --> 00:04:37.390
 cosmetics it just had a mask 

00:04:34.110 --> 00:04:40.000
 here everything is absolutely natural 

00:04:37.390 --> 00:04:42.610
 one function is ready to perform 

00:04:40.000 --> 00:04:45.310
 blush with blush makeup artists 

00:04:42.610 --> 00:04:49.270
 models the shape of the face in general everything 

00:04:45.310 --> 00:04:50.920
 makeup artists strive for the perfect shaft 

00:04:49.270 --> 00:04:53.200
 the streets in nature are tonus and you are not 

00:04:50.920 --> 00:04:55.980
 there is a round face of 

00:04:53.200 --> 00:05:00.190
 triangular face try to define myself 

00:04:55.980 --> 00:05:02.830
 clicking me oval face yes but here 

00:05:00.190 --> 00:05:05.350
 drew all the same some which parts of the face 

00:05:02.830 --> 00:05:06.460
 comes this with the help of blush we can 

00:05:05.350 --> 00:05:09.610
 it is leveled 

00:05:06.460 --> 00:05:12.580
 either we can level that powder 

00:05:09.610 --> 00:05:15.280
 bran umbrellas com darker shade and 

00:05:12.580 --> 00:05:17.540
 it is leveled with tonal 

00:05:15.280 --> 00:05:21.470
 darker cream which 

00:05:17.540 --> 00:05:23.720
 we use to apply the face here 

00:05:21.470 --> 00:05:26.960
 recently try this where Brother 

00:05:23.720 --> 00:05:29.660
 She without sparkles precisely such a powder and 

00:05:26.960 --> 00:05:32.770
 need to use to draw the oval 

00:05:29.660 --> 00:05:35.660
 faces and so again grab the brush 

00:05:32.770 --> 00:05:39.710
 lightly shake here 

00:05:35.660 --> 00:05:43.520
 see also dormans stand brackets yes 

00:05:39.710 --> 00:05:47.260
 and so we added a mode too 

00:05:43.520 --> 00:05:47.260
 good to carefully shade everything 

00:05:51.580 --> 00:06:02.610
 like this and visually later 

00:05:54.939 --> 00:06:02.610
 get try here 

00:06:20.060 --> 00:06:28.010
 I'll try to shake it off just to 

00:06:23.300 --> 00:06:28.010
 smooth line was soft and smooth and 

00:06:32.110 --> 00:06:37.350
 in this way it levels by 

00:06:34.990 --> 00:06:40.960
 Rouge that is, you still have such a function 

00:06:37.350 --> 00:06:43.810
 Well, this is a must mafia 

00:06:40.960 --> 00:06:47.290
 then transitions to level with 

00:06:43.810 --> 00:06:49.300
 powder powder should be smooth 

00:06:47.290 --> 00:06:51.460
 in any case, these crap 

00:06:49.300 --> 00:06:52.420
 which blizzard was removed and skolki we 

00:06:51.460 --> 00:06:55.090
 must be people 

00:06:52.420 --> 00:06:57.400
 though my advice was helpful and 

00:06:55.090 --> 00:06:59.200
 after a huge you I think it is not 

00:06:57.400 --> 00:07:02.410
 will be useful to us now all his life 

00:06:59.200 --> 00:07:06.960
 Well great benefit of the people apply 

00:07:02.410 --> 00:07:09.700
 always be happy fun and 

00:07:06.960 --> 00:07:11.910
 the natural most important thing 

00:07:09.700 --> 00:07:11.910
 kind
