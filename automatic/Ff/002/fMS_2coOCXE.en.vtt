00:00:31.120 --> 00:00:34.580
 I'm not alone 

00:00:34.580 --> 00:00:38.040
 I ran away at night and told 

00:00:38.040 --> 00:00:41.520
 After all it is my loneliness 

00:00:41.520 --> 00:00:48.080
 I just made it clear on the day 

00:00:52.160 --> 00:00:55.660
 The way back from the noise 

00:00:55.660 --> 00:00:59.340
 There is nothing different from usual 

00:00:59.340 --> 00:01:02.820
 If you think repeatedly 

00:01:02.820 --> 00:01:06.560
 Suddenly tears came up 

00:01:06.560 --> 00:01:10.040
 I can not rely on you 

00:01:10.040 --> 00:01:13.580
 Anxiety and sadness 

00:01:13.580 --> 00:01:21.740
 I wanted warmth with voice that did not become voice 

00:01:22.500 --> 00:01:25.960
 Hey you are certainly 

00:01:25.960 --> 00:01:29.596
 Suddenly appear 

00:01:29.600 --> 00:01:36.500
 The light was shining in my darkness 

00:01:36.500 --> 00:01:40.060
 And laugh a little 

00:01:40.060 --> 00:01:43.680
 I'm fine but I asked 

00:01:43.680 --> 00:01:50.400
 I took my hand and started walking 

00:01:50.400 --> 00:01:56.960
 I saw an angel wing on your back
