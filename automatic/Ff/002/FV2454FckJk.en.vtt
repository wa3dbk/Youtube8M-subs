00:00:18.940 --> 00:00:22.990
 so two novelties at trion this 

00:00:21.520 --> 00:00:25.720
 year first the thunder board 

00:00:22.990 --> 00:00:27.490
 as enders that will fit in the 

00:00:25.720 --> 00:00:29.350
 segment of the so-called fat 

00:00:27.490 --> 00:00:31.869
 custom ie a very bike 

00:00:29.350 --> 00:00:34.210
 massive very low a wide fork 

00:00:31.869 --> 00:00:36.010
 dress the aesthetic signature of the 

00:00:34.210 --> 00:00:38.200
 double that we launched there are 

00:00:36.010 --> 00:00:41.620
 many years already a brand new 

00:00:38.200 --> 00:00:44.470
 chassis that was worked out so 

00:00:41.620 --> 00:00:47.110
 allow a very driving position 

00:00:44.470 --> 00:00:49.540
 relax a very low bike a wide bike 

00:00:47.110 --> 00:00:51.730
 a bike that inspires a little bit the 

00:00:49.540 --> 00:00:53.980
 feeling to a heavy bomber a 

00:00:51.730 --> 00:00:54.430
 little bit that will roll more than he goes 

00:00:53.980 --> 00:00:57.879
 lean 

00:00:54.430 --> 00:01:00.190
 we take the 1700 thunder range 

00:00:57.879 --> 00:01:02.650
 board we already know of the storm that 

00:01:00.190 --> 00:01:06.130
 is the largest parallel twin of the 

00:01:02.650 --> 00:01:08.590
 market that makes 94 horses so 

00:01:06.130 --> 00:01:09.970
 can be flange to bhl for them 

00:01:08.590 --> 00:01:12.190
 allowed new licenses 

00:01:09.970 --> 00:01:14.470
 it's an engine that shines through 

00:01:12.190 --> 00:01:16.930
 couple his power and his lack of 

00:01:14.470 --> 00:01:19.690
 vibrations which is noticeable in this 

00:01:16.930 --> 00:01:23.260
 segment so a pleasure motorbike a beautiful 

00:01:19.690 --> 00:01:26.710

00:01:28.990 --> 00:01:33.760
 novelty still triumphs in the 

00:01:31.060 --> 00:01:35.230
 custom segment the thunder bird lt 

00:01:33.760 --> 00:01:37.510

00:01:55.690 --> 00:02:00.250
 talk we always have a big job that 

00:01:58.630 --> 00:02:04.630
 was done on ergonomics and on the 

00:02:00.250 --> 00:02:07.420

 and then little extra detail to 

00:02:11.360 --> 00:02:14.690
 to respect the codes of the segment we have 

00:02:13.250 --> 00:02:17.660
