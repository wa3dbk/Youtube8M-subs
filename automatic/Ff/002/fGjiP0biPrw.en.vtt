actually about the same I could have

00:03:07.970 --> 00:03:10.030 
actually about the same I could have
used<00:03:08.090> another<00:03:08.269> pot<00:03:08.750> so<00:03:09.170> you<00:03:09.320> know<00:03:09.410> I<00:03:09.590> suppose

00:03:10.030 --> 00:03:10.040 
used another pot so you know I suppose

00:03:10.040 --> 00:03:11.350 
used another pot so you know I suppose
most<00:03:10.370> of<00:03:10.459> the<00:03:10.549> other<00:03:10.670> ones<00:03:10.820> I<00:03:10.910> noticed<00:03:11.269> we're

00:03:11.350 --> 00:03:11.360 
most of the other ones I noticed we're

00:03:11.360 --> 00:03:12.759 
most of the other ones I noticed we're
finishing<00:03:11.630> it<00:03:11.750> about<00:03:11.900> two<00:03:12.049> pots<00:03:12.320> but<00:03:12.500> I<00:03:12.590> could

00:03:12.759 --> 00:03:12.769 
finishing it about two pots but I could

00:03:12.769 --> 00:03:13.990 
finishing it about two pots but I could
just<00:03:12.890> be<00:03:13.010> the<00:03:13.070> difference<00:03:13.370> if<00:03:13.489> I<00:03:13.579> felt<00:03:13.850> like

00:03:13.990 --> 00:03:14.000 
just be the difference if I felt like

00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:15.400 
just be the difference if I felt like
using<00:03:14.209> a<00:03:14.420> pot<00:03:14.660> because<00:03:14.959> you<00:03:15.110> know<00:03:15.200> did

00:03:15.400 --> 00:03:15.410 
using a pot because you know did

00:03:15.410 --> 00:03:16.810 
using a pot because you know did
basically<00:03:15.709> doesn't<00:03:15.980> matter<00:03:16.250> cuz<00:03:16.519> there's<00:03:16.700> no

00:03:16.810 --> 00:03:16.820 
basically doesn't matter cuz there's no

00:03:16.820 --> 00:03:20.560 
basically doesn't matter cuz there's no
counter<00:03:17.480> ganking<00:03:17.810> or<00:03:17.870> anything<00:03:19.209> yeah<00:03:20.209> so<00:03:20.390> zach

00:03:20.560 --> 00:03:20.570 
counter ganking or anything yeah so zach

00:03:20.570 --> 00:03:22.090 
counter ganking or anything yeah so zach
is<00:03:20.750> just<00:03:20.959> gonna<00:03:21.079> be<00:03:21.170> the<00:03:21.350> same<00:03:21.530> he's<00:03:21.799> going<00:03:22.040> to

00:03:22.090 --> 00:03:22.100 
is just gonna be the same he's going to

00:03:22.100 --> 00:03:25.780 
is just gonna be the same he's going to
ramp<00:03:22.910> up<00:03:23.060> at<00:03:23.209> a<00:03:23.269> faster<00:03:23.630> faster<00:03:24.610> double<00:03:25.610> clear

00:03:25.780 --> 00:03:25.790 
ramp up at a faster faster double clear

00:03:25.790 --> 00:03:28.720 
ramp up at a faster faster double clear
speed<00:03:26.180> well<00:03:27.019> you<00:03:27.650> know<00:03:27.739> remaining<00:03:28.190> relatively

00:03:28.720 --> 00:03:28.730 
speed well you know remaining relatively

00:03:28.730 --> 00:03:31.820 
speed well you know remaining relatively
healthy

00:03:31.820 --> 00:03:31.830 

00:03:31.830 --> 00:03:35.210 

in<00:03:32.790> it<00:03:33.030> I<00:03:33.390> think<00:03:33.870> he<00:03:33.960> was<00:03:34.080> really<00:03:34.800> good<00:03:34.980> at<00:03:35.010> this

00:03:35.210 --> 00:03:35.220 
in it I think he was really good at this

00:03:35.220 --> 00:03:38.180 
in it I think he was really good at this
role<00:03:35.520> and<00:03:35.550> in<00:03:35.910> sort<00:03:36.120> of<00:03:36.150> a<00:03:36.270> very<00:03:36.480> very<00:03:37.440> indirect

00:03:38.180 --> 00:03:38.190 
role and in sort of a very very indirect

00:03:38.190 --> 00:03:39.980 
role and in sort of a very very indirect
sense<00:03:38.460> since<00:03:38.730> there's<00:03:38.970> a<00:03:39.030> lot<00:03:39.240> probably<00:03:39.750> a<00:03:39.900> lot

00:03:39.980 --> 00:03:39.990 
sense since there's a lot probably a lot

00:03:39.990 --> 00:03:41.630 
sense since there's a lot probably a lot
more<00:03:40.020> viable<00:03:40.440> you<00:03:40.860> know<00:03:40.980> ap<00:03:41.220> jungles

00:03:41.630 --> 00:03:41.640 
more viable you know ap jungles

00:03:41.640 --> 00:03:44.140 
more viable you know ap jungles
especially<00:03:42.210> from<00:03:42.720> what<00:03:42.870> I've<00:03:42.960> been<00:03:43.110> noticing

00:03:44.140 --> 00:03:44.150
