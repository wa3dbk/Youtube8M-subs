00:00:13.139 --> 00:00:16.170
 simple and it's very useful and I will 

00:00:14.580 --> 00:00:17.970
 advise me to do it at least once 

00:00:16.170 --> 00:00:19.650
 per month 

00:00:17.970 --> 00:00:22.740

00:00:29.790 --> 00:00:36.089

00:01:00.989 --> 00:01:04.320
 higher than usual but here it is 

00:01:02.309 --> 00:01:05.850
