00:00:31.009 --> 00:00:31.019 
did put in the thermal paste on so we

00:00:31.019 --> 00:00:33.799 
did put in the thermal paste on so we
are<00:00:31.050> clear<00:00:31.529> to<00:00:32.219> go<00:00:32.850> on<00:00:33.030> I'm<00:00:33.360> gonna<00:00:33.540> be<00:00:33.630> using

00:00:42.950 --> 00:00:42.960 
to talked about how everybody has a

00:00:42.960 --> 00:00:48.410 
to talked about how everybody has a
different<00:00:43.920> way<00:00:44.129> of<00:00:44.250> doing<00:00:44.520> this<00:00:44.820> I<00:00:47.420> haven't

00:00:48.410 --> 00:00:48.420 
different way of doing this I haven't

00:00:48.420 --> 00:00:50.510 
different way of doing this I haven't
tried<00:00:48.629> this<00:00:48.870> way<00:00:49.110> yet<00:00:49.379> so<00:00:49.710> I<00:00:49.739> wanted<00:00:50.039> to<00:00:50.280> give

00:00:50.510 --> 00:00:50.520 
tried this way yet so I wanted to give

00:00:50.520 --> 00:00:54.889 
tried this way yet so I wanted to give
it<00:00:50.550> a<00:00:50.700> try<00:00:51.000> I<00:00:51.890> figured<00:00:52.890> why<00:00:53.280> not<00:00:53.340> do<00:00:53.640> it<00:00:53.670> on<00:00:53.940> the

00:00:54.889 --> 00:00:54.899 
it a try I figured why not do it on the

00:00:54.899 --> 00:00:58.250 
it a try I figured why not do it on the
most<00:00:55.110> expensive<00:00:55.680> component<00:00:55.860> I<00:00:56.340> have<00:00:57.140> as<00:00:58.140> good

00:00:58.250 --> 00:00:58.260 
most expensive component I have as good

00:00:58.260 --> 00:01:05.210 
most expensive component I have as good
a<00:00:58.320> time<00:00:58.500> as<00:00:58.559> any<00:00:58.800> right<00:01:03.530> this<00:01:04.530> stuff<00:01:04.799> has<00:01:05.010> the

00:01:05.210 --> 00:01:05.220 
a time as any right this stuff has the

00:01:05.220 --> 00:01:14.210 
a time as any right this stuff has the
weirdest<00:01:06.170> consistency<00:01:07.700> its<00:01:08.700> I<00:01:13.010> couldn't<00:01:14.010> tell

00:01:14.210 --> 00:01:14.220 
weirdest consistency its I couldn't tell

00:01:14.220 --> 00:01:20.499 
weirdest consistency its I couldn't tell
you<00:01:14.369> of<00:01:14.520> what<00:01:14.729> it<00:01:14.760> feels<00:01:15.060> like<00:01:15.150> to<00:01:15.479> be<00:01:15.600> honest

00:01:20.499 --> 00:01:20.509 

00:01:20.509 --> 00:01:24.649 

but<00:01:21.509> yeah<00:01:21.780> see<00:01:22.110> that<00:01:22.850> that<00:01:23.850> little<00:01:24.119> bit<00:01:24.299> even

00:01:24.649 --> 00:01:24.659 
but yeah see that that little bit even

00:01:24.659 --> 00:01:31.330 
but yeah see that that little bit even
that<00:01:24.869> was<00:01:25.049> probably<00:01:25.380> a<00:01:26.299> lot<00:01:27.299> but<00:01:27.600> it<00:01:28.909> it<00:01:29.909> dot<00:01:30.150> it

00:01:31.330 --> 00:01:31.340 
that was probably a lot but it it dot it

00:01:31.340 --> 00:01:36.890 
that was probably a lot but it it dot it
and<00:01:32.340> this<00:01:32.549> stuff<00:01:32.759> doesn't<00:01:32.970> really<00:01:33.329> dry<00:01:35.659> like<00:01:36.659> I

00:01:36.890 --> 00:01:36.900 
and this stuff doesn't really dry like I

00:01:36.900 --> 00:01:41.630 
and this stuff doesn't really dry like I
thought<00:01:37.680> it<00:01:37.860> did<00:01:38.070> when<00:01:38.490> I<00:01:38.729> first<00:01:40.579> went<00:01:41.579> to

00:01:41.630 --> 00:01:41.640 
thought it did when I first went to

00:01:41.640 --> 00:01:46.340 
thought it did when I first went to
apply<00:01:42.030> it<00:01:42.090> but<00:01:43.939> you<00:01:44.939> can<00:01:45.119> see<00:01:45.329> and<00:01:45.840> I<00:01:45.990> didn't<00:01:46.259> do

00:01:46.340 --> 00:01:46.350 
apply it but you can see and I didn't do

00:01:46.350 --> 00:01:51.410 
apply it but you can see and I didn't do
a<00:01:46.380> very<00:01:46.590> good<00:01:46.710> job<00:01:46.890> but<00:01:48.079> it's<00:01:49.079> just<00:01:49.470> a<00:01:50.420> thin

00:01:51.410 --> 00:01:51.420 
a very good job but it's just a thin

00:01:51.420 --> 00:02:03.510 
a very good job but it's just a thin
layer<00:01:52.850> right<00:01:53.850> there

00:02:03.510 --> 00:02:03.520 

00:02:03.520 --> 00:02:14.800 

yep<00:02:12.550> I'm<00:02:13.550> gonna<00:02:13.670> take<00:02:13.940> some<00:02:14.150> stills<00:02:14.420> I'll<00:02:14.690> be

00:02:14.800 --> 00:02:14.810 
yep I'm gonna take some stills I'll be
