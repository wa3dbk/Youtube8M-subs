00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.770
 Oxygen supply to the blood by eating nitrate-rich vegetables 

00:00:07.770 --> 00:00:11.690
 Eating some beets can improve your athletic performance, which is of course very good. 

00:00:11.690 --> 00:00:14.590
 But even if you can run 5% faster, what about? 

00:00:14.590 --> 00:00:16.720
 This may be a fun experiment: eat a can of beet, 

00:00:16.720 --> 00:00:19.580
 Then maybe shorten your minute from your five-kilometer run. 

00:00:19.580 --> 00:00:22.440
 However, by using oxygen more efficiently, you can really benefit from it, 

00:00:22.440 --> 00:00:26.160
 Those who have emphysema. 

00:00:26.160 --> 00:00:30.010
 Nice, healthy young people by eating some vegetables and beets 

00:00:30.010 --> 00:00:32.590
 You can swim faster and farther, run faster and farther, and ride faster and farther 

00:00:32.590 --> 00:00:36.420
 But what about those who pant when they climb a few stairs? 

00:00:36.420 --> 00:00:39.760
 Can those vegetables rich in nitrates play their due role? 

00:00:39.760 --> 00:00:41.650
 can! After drinking two beets of juice, 

00:00:41.650 --> 00:00:44.910
 Staying on the treadmill for a long time! 

00:00:44.910 --> 00:00:47.280
 Beets can lower the blood pressure of healthy young people 

00:00:47.280 --> 00:00:48.910
 This is of course a good thing, 

00:00:48.910 --> 00:00:53.670
 But what about those who are old and too fat and really need them? 

00:00:53.670 --> 00:00:57.149
 Contrast with plum juice and drink a glass of beet juice every day. 

00:00:57.149 --> 00:00:59.960
 Blood pressure drops dramatically after a few weeks 

00:00:59.960 --> 00:01:02.710
 But after drinking three weeks of beet juice 

00:01:02.710 --> 00:01:05.239
 Just stop for a few days 

00:01:05.239 --> 00:01:07.380
 The blood pressure immediately rose back. 

00:01:07.380 --> 00:01:13.270
 Therefore, we must eat vegetables and continue to eat vegetables. 

00:01:13.270 --> 00:01:16.520
 Why has it been dragged until 2015? 

00:01:16.520 --> 00:01:19.450
 Only published a report on reducing blood pressure in patients with hypertension? 

00:01:19.450 --> 00:01:22.679
 You probably thought this was the first group that wanted to do this research. 

00:01:22.679 --> 00:01:25.889
 The question is, who is going to sponsor such a research - a big company that sells beets? 

00:01:25.889 --> 00:01:29.909
 The blood pressure lowering drug has a revenue of more than 10 billion a year. 

00:01:29.909 --> 00:01:33.619
 Selling sugar beets is less than tens of billions. 

00:01:33.619 --> 00:01:37.229
 But that's why there is something like the British Heart Foundation. 

00:01:37.229 --> 00:01:39.979
 Such a charity to fund this research 

00:01:39.979 --> 00:01:42.670
 For four weeks, give each of the hypertensive patients a glass of beet juice per person per day. 

00:01:42.670 --> 00:01:45.579
 After all, high blood pressure may be the world 

00:01:45.579 --> 00:01:47.969
 The number one risk factor for premature death 

00:01:47.969 --> 00:01:52.779
 Within a decade it will affect nearly a third of adults on the planet. 

00:01:52.779 --> 00:01:55.369
 Let those hypertensive patients drink beet juice, blood pressure will drop 

00:01:55.369 --> 00:01:59.200
 Blood pressure continued to drop until it was stopped one month later. 

00:01:59.200 --> 00:02:02.090
 Despite receiving treatment, there are still so many people with high blood pressure 

00:02:02.090 --> 00:02:05.689
 Thus from a public health perspective, 

00:02:05.689 --> 00:02:07.249
 Take further countermeasures and eat more vegetables rich in nitrates. 

00:02:07.249 --> 00:02:12.510
 To deal with high blood pressure, maybe economically viable 

00:02:12.510 --> 00:02:16.220
 What about the situation for those with peripheral arterial disease? 

00:02:16.220 --> 00:02:20.780
 Millions of people lead to poor blood flow to the legs due to atherosclerosis 

00:02:20.780 --> 00:02:24.190
 Caused a pain in the calf, which is called a lame 

00:02:24.190 --> 00:02:26.660
 This is due to impeded arteries and poor blood flow. 

00:02:26.660 --> 00:02:30.630
 Seriously limits the ability of people to walk, even if they just walk around 

00:02:30.630 --> 00:02:36.310
 But as long as you drink some beet juice, you can go 18% more. 

00:02:36.310 --> 00:02:39.560
 Let's take a look at the real dry goods, I have never seen anything like this before. 

00:02:39.560 --> 00:02:44.610
 They measured the actual oxygen content of the blood in the leg muscles. 

00:02:44.610 --> 00:02:48.630
 The control group was white and the beet group was black, indicating that they were 

00:02:48.630 --> 00:02:54.050
 How to maintain more oxygen in the muscles only by eating vegetables 

00:02:54.050 --> 00:02:57.730
 Nitric oxide from vegetable nitrates not only increases oxygen efficiency 

00:02:57.730 --> 00:03:01.120
 And by increasing the oxygen supply by relaxing the blood vessels, 

00:03:01.120 --> 00:03:04.030
 At the same time, the artery is also opened, which promotes blood flow. 

00:03:04.030 --> 00:03:05.400
 I am surprised that those beet juice companies 

00:03:05.400 --> 00:03:08.320
 Still not trying to establish their status as a plant Viagra 

00:03:08.320 --> 00:03:11.860
 This can of course be used to explain why those who eat more vegetables 

00:03:11.860 --> 00:03:14.940
 Will have stronger sexual function 

00:03:14.940 --> 00:03:17.210
 Although this is an isolated study in time 

00:03:17.210 --> 00:03:20.290
 Therefore, we can't determine which is the cause and which is the fruit, but the low amount of fruits and vegetables are edible. 

00:03:20.290 --> 00:03:24.710
 Leading to erectile dysfunction seems to be a more reasonable explanation, 

00:03:24.710 --> 00:03:28.130
 Not the other way around. 

00:03:28.130 --> 00:03:33.260
 As the most important organ-brain, what is the situation? 

00:03:33.260 --> 00:03:37.150
 Decreased cognitive ability and Alzheimer's disease, 

00:03:37.150 --> 00:03:39.600
 Related to insufficient blood oxygen supply in the brain 

00:03:39.600 --> 00:03:41.840
 And they show the nitrate in the vegetables 

00:03:41.840 --> 00:03:45.030
 May be helpful in treating cognitive decline associated with old age 

00:03:45.030 --> 00:03:47.960
 They showed dietary nitrates in the frontal lobe 

00:03:47.960 --> 00:03:50.870
 The blood flow of the brain plays a direct role. 

00:03:50.870 --> 00:03:54.990
 The frontal lobe is particularly prone to deterioration due to old age. 

00:03:54.990 --> 00:03:58.490
 It is the key area in the brain that controls the so-called executive function. 

00:03:58.490 --> 00:04:02.569
 Responsible for major work and problem solving, is important for the daily function of the brain. 

00:04:02.569 --> 00:04:04.959
 The study showed nitrites from nitrates 

00:04:04.959 --> 00:04:08.569
 Not only increase blood flow to certain parts of the body 

00:04:08.569 --> 00:04:12.230
 And it tends to be so under low oxygen conditions. 

00:04:12.230 --> 00:04:13.410
 This makes it possible in the body 

00:04:13.410 --> 00:04:16.400
 The most needed place to increase blood flow. 

00:04:16.400 --> 00:04:18.509
 This is what they found in the brain: 

00:04:18.509 --> 00:04:22.880
 Increase blood flow to areas of risk in the aging brain. 

00:04:22.880 --> 00:04:26.710
 The only side effect of eating beets to benefit the brain? 

00:04:26.710 --> 00:04:29.990
 Add a little extra color to your life.
