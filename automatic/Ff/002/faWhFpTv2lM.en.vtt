00:00:02.150 --> 00:00:08.809
 in this opportunity we are going to review what 

00:00:05.180 --> 00:00:11.469
 is and its characteristics of the link 

00:00:08.809 --> 00:00:11.469
 metal 

00:00:13.320 --> 00:00:18.630
 here we can observe the periodic table 

00:00:16.379 --> 00:00:21.990
 of the chemical elements 

00:00:18.630 --> 00:00:26.340
 in color calipso which is the majority of the 

00:00:21.990 --> 00:00:28.590
 table we see the metallic elements 

00:00:26.340 --> 00:00:31.320
 the metallic elements differ 

00:00:28.590 --> 00:00:33.750
 with the rest of the elements of the 

00:00:31.320 --> 00:00:36.500
 metalloids non-metals and gases 

00:00:33.750 --> 00:00:39.750
 noblemen by a series of characteristics 

00:00:36.500 --> 00:00:43.420
 that make them behave in a way 

00:00:39.750 --> 00:00:47.980
 determined by forming a link 

00:00:43.420 --> 00:00:52.000
 so the metal bond is presented 

00:00:47.980 --> 00:00:56.650
 only between metals either the same 

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:59.320
 metal or two or more different metals 

00:00:56.650 --> 00:01:03.160
 metals tend to give up electrons 

00:00:59.320 --> 00:01:07.090
 to become cations a cation 

00:01:03.160 --> 00:01:11.189
 it's a million that has a positive charge 

00:01:07.090 --> 00:01:11.189
 that is to say that it has lost electrons 

00:01:11.280 --> 00:01:17.720
 but they do not do it randomly is 

00:01:13.950 --> 00:01:21.750
 say they do not lose electrons so 

00:01:17.720 --> 00:01:23.790
 random but they lose exactly 

00:01:21.750 --> 00:01:26.400
 the amount of electrons that are left over 

00:01:23.790 --> 00:01:28.810
 to make the nearest noble gas 

00:01:26.400 --> 00:01:32.200
 previous 

00:01:28.810 --> 00:01:34.780
 for example here we see the equation of 

00:01:32.200 --> 00:01:38.110
 oxidation of sodium in state 

00:01:34.780 --> 00:01:41.920
 fundamental that becomes cations 

00:01:38.110 --> 00:01:44.280
 sodium or sodium plus one losing a 

00:01:41.920 --> 00:01:44.280
 electron 

00:01:44.620 --> 00:01:49.030
 if we observe the configuration 

00:01:47.020 --> 00:01:51.510
 Sodium electronics in state 

00:01:49.030 --> 00:01:57.670
 elementary 

00:01:51.510 --> 00:02:00.549
 1 s 2 2 s 2 263 s 1 

00:01:57.670 --> 00:02:03.520
 we see that the valence electron is 

00:02:00.549 --> 00:02:06.650
 This corresponds to the one at the level 

00:02:03.520 --> 00:02:09.890
 highest level 3 

00:02:06.650 --> 00:02:13.130
 and it is not paired ie it is a 

00:02:09.890 --> 00:02:16.580
 helpless electron 

00:02:13.130 --> 00:02:19.130
 the noble gas above if we see the table 

00:02:16.580 --> 00:02:21.680
 periodic is the lion that has the 

00:02:19.130 --> 00:02:26.580
 next electronic configuration 

00:02:21.680 --> 00:02:28.300
 12 12 22 p 6 

00:02:26.580 --> 00:02:31.570
 that is to say 

00:02:28.300 --> 00:02:32.310
 sodium has all the electrons in the 

00:02:31.570 --> 00:02:36.200
 Lion 

00:02:32.310 --> 00:02:41.170
 adding his valence electron 

00:02:36.200 --> 00:02:41.170
 and therefore if it loses it's electron 

00:02:42.790 --> 00:02:49.520
 is going to turn 

00:02:45.770 --> 00:02:51.650
 in the search in sodium with the same 

00:02:49.520 --> 00:02:54.530
 electronic configuration than a gas 

00:02:51.650 --> 00:02:59.680
 noble which suits you a lot since 

00:02:54.530 --> 00:02:59.680
 your electronic cloud stabilizes 

00:03:00.590 --> 00:03:06.920
 the atoms of a metal in state 

00:03:03.140 --> 00:03:10.280
 elementary are not stable by the same 

00:03:06.920 --> 00:03:14.930
 reason that I already mentioned the electron of 

00:03:10.280 --> 00:03:18.080
 valencia does not stabilize when being so 

00:03:14.930 --> 00:03:21.290
 close the possibility of being a gas 

00:03:18.080 --> 00:03:23.870
 noble and therefore metals have 

00:03:21.290 --> 00:03:25.850
 a special behavior when they are 

00:03:23.870 --> 00:03:28.670
 in the mental stable 

00:03:25.850 --> 00:03:30.890
 for example the aluminum foil we see that 

00:03:28.670 --> 00:03:32.970
 shines this is because all the cores 

00:03:30.890 --> 00:03:35.910
 of aluminum 

00:03:32.970 --> 00:03:39.450
 they give up their valence electrons that 

00:03:35.910 --> 00:03:42.540
 would be three and these remain in the 

00:03:39.450 --> 00:03:44.300
 surface of aluminum what gives it 

00:03:42.540 --> 00:03:48.970
 the bright 

00:03:44.300 --> 00:03:48.970
 both this one and any metal 

00:03:51.340 --> 00:03:57.090
 let's review a question to see if 

00:03:53.830 --> 00:03:57.090
 we understood these concepts 

00:03:57.360 --> 00:04:04.540
 it is understood as a metallic element 

00:04:00.490 --> 00:04:06.740
 those who earn electrons are 

00:04:04.540 --> 00:04:08.540
 lose electrons 

00:04:06.740 --> 00:04:11.780
 to achieve the configuration 

00:04:08.540 --> 00:04:15.080
 electronics of a noble gas share 

00:04:11.780 --> 00:04:17.030
 its valence electrons and d for 

00:04:15.080 --> 00:04:18.920
 achieve the electronic configuration of 

00:04:17.030 --> 00:04:21.400
 noble waves yield their electrons from 

00:04:18.920 --> 00:04:21.400
 Valencia 

00:04:23.660 --> 00:04:28.180
 I underline the keywords of each 

00:04:25.970 --> 00:04:28.180
 alternative 

00:04:30.900 --> 00:04:35.160
 the alternative to is incorrect since 

00:04:33.630 --> 00:04:38.130
 the metals 

00:04:35.160 --> 00:04:40.200
 they never earn electrons but tend 

00:04:38.130 --> 00:04:44.360
 rather to the contrary 

00:04:40.200 --> 00:04:46.939
 the baby alternative is correct 

00:04:44.360 --> 00:04:50.419
 the alternative is not correct since 

00:04:46.939 --> 00:04:52.370
 the electrons of a metal do not 

00:04:50.419 --> 00:04:55.909
 share the link 

00:04:52.370 --> 00:04:58.639
 only the chemical lace in the 

00:04:55.909 --> 00:05:01.819
 which the electrons of each atom are 

00:04:58.639 --> 00:05:04.729
 share is the covalent and occurs between 

00:05:01.819 --> 00:05:06.900
 two non-metals is therefore discarded 

00:05:04.729 --> 00:05:10.400
 the alternative c 

00:05:06.900 --> 00:05:14.009
 and the d is correct since effectively 

00:05:10.400 --> 00:05:15.479
 a metal yields its valence electrons 

00:05:14.009 --> 00:05:18.370
 to achieve the configuration 

00:05:15.479 --> 00:05:21.040
 electronic of a noble gas 

00:05:18.370 --> 00:05:24.100
 therefore the correct alternative is 

00:05:21.040 --> 00:05:27.160
 the one since it also contains the 

00:05:24.100 --> 00:05:30.240
 alternative sees when you say that you give up your 

00:05:27.160 --> 00:05:30.240
 valence electrons
