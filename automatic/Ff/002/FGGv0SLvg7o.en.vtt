that<00:04:19.500> will<00:04:19.650> tell<00:04:19.799> me<00:04:19.950> that<00:04:20.070> both<00:04:20.280> walls<00:04:20.609> are<00:04:21.060> a

00:04:21.110 --> 00:04:21.120 
that will tell me that both walls are a

00:04:21.120 --> 00:04:22.880 
that will tell me that both walls are a
90<00:04:21.540> degrees<00:04:21.810> angle<00:04:21.989> so<00:04:22.530> we're<00:04:22.650> going<00:04:22.740> to<00:04:22.800> be

00:04:22.880 --> 00:04:22.890 
90 degrees angle so we're going to be

00:04:22.890 --> 00:04:23.840 
90 degrees angle so we're going to be
using<00:04:23.070> the<00:04:23.160> same<00:04:23.310> technique<00:04:23.640> we've<00:04:23.760> been
