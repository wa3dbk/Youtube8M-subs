I'm in the open field I've got one

00:01:51.930 --> 00:01:54.440 
I'm in the open field I've got one
player<00:01:52.200> to<00:01:52.229> beat<00:01:52.530> the<00:01:52.710> safety<00:01:53.130> I<00:01:53.310> decide<00:01:54.119> to

00:01:54.440 --> 00:01:54.450 
player to beat the safety I decide to

00:01:54.450 --> 00:01:57.950 
player to beat the safety I decide to
run<00:01:54.869> forward<00:01:55.350> and<00:01:55.470> execute<00:01:55.920> a<00:01:56.009> spin<00:01:56.310> move<00:01:56.960> the

00:01:57.950 --> 00:01:57.960 
run forward and execute a spin move the

00:01:57.960 --> 00:02:01.340 
run forward and execute a spin move the
defender<00:01:58.670> never<00:01:59.670> changes<00:02:00.570> his<00:02:00.600> path<00:02:01.140> of

00:02:01.340 --> 00:02:01.350 
defender never changes his path of

00:02:01.350 --> 00:02:04.160 
defender never changes his path of
direction<00:02:01.829> and<00:02:01.950> pursuing<00:02:02.399> me<00:02:02.630> my<00:02:03.630> spin<00:02:03.990> move

direction and pursuing me my spin move

00:02:04.170 --> 00:02:06.020 
direction and pursuing me my spin move
ultimately<00:02:04.680> just<00:02:04.920> means<00:02:05.100> I<00:02:05.280> get<00:02:05.340> hit<00:02:05.670> lower

00:02:06.020 --> 00:02:06.030 
ultimately just means I get hit lower

00:02:06.030 --> 00:02:10.130 
ultimately just means I get hit lower
harder<00:02:07.700> to<00:02:08.700> me<00:02:08.879> the<00:02:09.179> issue<00:02:09.330> with<00:02:09.599> locomotion

in Madden the defender has always moved

00:02:15.830 --> 00:02:18.380 
in Madden the defender has always moved
just<00:02:16.830> as<00:02:16.980> much<00:02:17.220> as<00:02:17.490> the<00:02:17.640> offensive<00:02:18.060> player

00:02:18.380 --> 00:02:18.390 
just as much as the offensive player

00:02:18.390 --> 00:02:21.860 
just as much as the offensive player

which is never the way it should be so
here<00:02:22.050> you<00:02:22.200> see<00:02:22.230> whether<00:02:23.100> you<00:02:23.250> want<00:02:23.400> to<00:02:23.460> say

here you see whether you want to say

00:02:23.580 --> 00:02:25.250 
here you see whether you want to say
well<00:02:23.790> he<00:02:23.880> didn't<00:02:24.120> just<00:02:24.240> fall<00:02:24.540> for<00:02:24.960> it<00:02:25.080> or

00:02:25.250 --> 00:02:25.260 
well he didn't just fall for it or

well he didn't just fall for it or
whatever<00:02:25.560> the<00:02:25.710> case<00:02:25.980> the<00:02:26.450> defender<00:02:27.450> doesn't

00:02:28.300 --> 00:02:28.310 
whatever the case the defender doesn't

00:02:28.310 --> 00:02:31.430 
whatever the case the defender doesn't
awkwardly<00:02:29.310> change<00:02:30.210> his<00:02:30.450> direction<00:02:30.840> based<00:02:31.170> on

awkwardly change his direction based on
the<00:02:31.560> spin<00:02:31.860> he<00:02:32.070> keeps<00:02:32.460> his<00:02:32.700> eyes<00:02:33.000> he<00:02:33.720> keeps<00:02:34.050> his

00:02:34.220 --> 00:02:34.230 
the spin he keeps his eyes he keeps his

00:02:34.230 --> 00:02:38.150 
the spin he keeps his eyes he keeps his
focus<00:02:34.470> he<00:02:34.830> keeps<00:02:35.070> his<00:02:35.250> pursuit<00:02:35.730> lane<00:02:37.160> constant

00:02:38.160 --> 00:02:39.920 
focus he keeps his pursuit lane constant
to<00:02:38.250> the<00:02:38.280> player<00:02:38.610> he's<00:02:38.880> attempting<00:02:39.360> to<00:02:39.450> tackle

to the player he's attempting to tackle

to the player he's attempting to tackle
and<00:02:40.080> you<00:02:40.560> can<00:02:40.710> see<00:02:40.890> the<00:02:41.100> only<00:02:41.340> thing<00:02:41.550> that<00:02:41.670> gets

00:02:41.750 --> 00:02:41.760 
and you can see the only thing that gets

00:02:41.760 --> 00:02:44.840 
and you can see the only thing that gets
altered<00:02:42.060> is<00:02:42.770> where<00:02:43.770> the<00:02:43.950> tackle<00:02:44.310> takes<00:02:44.460> place

00:02:44.840 --> 00:02:44.850 
altered is where the tackle takes place

00:02:44.850 --> 00:02:47.090 
altered is where the tackle takes place
and<00:02:45.120> how<00:02:45.210> the<00:02:45.270> tackle<00:02:45.720> takes<00:02:45.840> place<00:02:46.200> obviously

00:02:47.090 --> 00:02:47.100 
and how the tackle takes place obviously

00:02:47.100 --> 00:02:49.430 
and how the tackle takes place obviously
before<00:02:47.790> the<00:02:47.940> spin<00:02:48.270> they<00:02:48.780> were<00:02:48.840> lined<00:02:49.140> up<00:02:49.290> to

before the spin they were lined up to

00:02:49.440 --> 00:02:51.740 
before the spin they were lined up to
hit<00:02:49.560> chest<00:02:49.830> to<00:02:49.980> chest<00:02:50.270> after<00:02:51.270> the<00:02:51.420> spin

00:02:51.740 --> 00:02:51.750 
hit chest to chest after the spin

00:02:51.750 --> 00:02:54.380 
hit chest to chest after the spin
they're<00:02:52.620> lined<00:02:52.920> up<00:02:53.130> so<00:02:53.580> that<00:02:53.730> the<00:02:53.850> safety<00:02:54.240> can

00:02:54.380 --> 00:02:54.390 
they're lined up so that the safety can

00:02:54.390 --> 00:02:57.040 
they're lined up so that the safety can
tackle<00:02:54.630> him<00:02:54.930> with<00:02:55.080> an<00:02:55.170> arm<00:02:55.350> tackle<00:02:55.830> down<00:02:56.010> low

00:02:57.040 --> 00:02:57.050 
tackle him with an arm tackle down low

now<00:02:58.050> we're<00:02:58.200> going<00:02:58.320> to<00:02:58.380> go<00:02:58.500> and<00:02:58.650> see<00:02:58.770> how<00:02:58.890> this

00:02:59.120 --> 00:02:59.130 
now we're going to go and see how this

00:02:59.130 --> 00:03:00.680 
now we're going to go and see how this

reacts and Madden before we do that I

00:03:00.690 --> 00:03:02.330 
reacts and Madden before we do that I
just<00:03:00.960> want<00:03:01.020> to<00:03:01.230> play<00:03:01.380> this<00:03:01.530> at<00:03:01.680> one<00:03:01.860> time<00:03:02.040> at

00:03:02.330 --> 00:03:02.340 
just want to play this at one time at

00:03:02.340 --> 00:03:16.280 
just want to play this at one time at

00:03:16.280 --> 00:03:16.290 

00:03:16.290 --> 00:03:19.080 

I'd<00:03:17.290> man<00:03:17.560> ten<00:03:17.830> play<00:03:18.069> this<00:03:18.250> from<00:03:18.640> a<00:03:18.670> Peyton

00:03:19.080 --> 00:03:19.090

I'd man ten play this from a Peyton
Manning's<00:03:19.360> perspective<00:03:19.930> very<00:03:20.080> similar<00:03:20.440> play

Manning's perspective very similar play

00:03:20.769 --> 00:03:23.190 
Manning's perspective very similar play
in<00:03:21.250> terms<00:03:21.730> of<00:03:21.970> where<00:03:22.540> the<00:03:22.659> ball<00:03:22.840> was<00:03:22.959> being

more<00:03:42.430> animations<00:03:43.269> you're<00:03:43.480> giving<00:03:43.810> the

00:03:44.089 --> 00:03:44.099 
more animations you're giving the

00:03:44.099 --> 00:03:46.500 
more animations you're giving the
offense<00:03:45.099> more<00:03:45.400> control<00:03:45.819> when<00:03:45.940> the<00:03:46.000> defense

00:03:46.500 --> 00:03:46.510 
offense more control when the defense

00:03:46.510 --> 00:03:48.509 
offense more control when the defense
already<00:03:46.810> has<00:03:46.959> a<00:03:46.989> very<00:03:47.410> hard<00:03:47.680> time<00:03:47.860> reacting<00:03:48.400> to

00:03:48.509 --> 00:03:48.519 
already has a very hard time reacting to

00:03:48.519 --> 00:03:50.220 
already has a very hard time reacting to
the<00:03:48.610> game<00:03:48.790> as<00:03:48.970> it<00:03:49.090> is<00:03:49.209> so<00:03:49.420> first<00:03:49.930> thing<00:03:50.110> we'll

00:03:50.220 --> 00:03:50.230 
the game as it is so first thing we'll

00:03:50.230 --> 00:03:52.319 
the game as it is so first thing we'll
start<00:03:50.500> off<00:03:50.620> with<00:03:50.860> is<00:03:51.010> austin<00:03:51.370> collie<00:03:51.610> he<00:03:52.090> makes

00:03:52.319 --> 00:03:52.329 
start off with is austin collie he makes

00:03:52.329 --> 00:03:55.020 
start off with is austin collie he makes
us<00:03:52.540> cut<00:03:52.780> the<00:03:53.260> defender<00:03:53.709> reacts<00:03:54.069> afterwards<00:03:54.849> I

00:03:55.020 --> 00:03:55.030 
us cut the defender reacts afterwards I

00:03:55.030 --> 00:03:56.819 
us cut the defender reacts afterwards I
definitely<00:03:55.390> like<00:03:55.690> that<00:03:55.930> that's<00:03:56.200> exactly<00:03:56.650> the

00:03:56.819 --> 00:03:56.829 
definitely like that that's exactly the

00:03:56.829 --> 00:03:58.830 
definitely like that that's exactly the
way<00:03:56.950> it<00:03:57.069> should<00:03:57.099> be<00:03:57.310> now<00:03:57.970> the<00:03:58.030> problem<00:03:58.359> comes

00:03:58.830 --> 00:03:58.840 
way it should be now the problem comes

00:03:58.840 --> 00:04:00.990 
way it should be now the problem comes
in<00:03:59.079> once<00:03:59.680> the<00:03:59.890> ball<00:04:00.069> is<00:04:00.129> thrown<00:04:00.700> on<00:04:00.910> the

00:04:00.990 --> 00:04:01.000 
in once the ball is thrown on the

00:04:01.000 --> 00:04:02.520 
in once the ball is thrown on the
rollout<00:04:01.450> you<00:04:01.660> see<00:04:01.810> there's<00:04:01.989> Manning<00:04:02.379> in<00:04:02.470> the

00:04:02.520 --> 00:04:02.530 
rollout you see there's Manning in the

00:04:02.530 --> 00:04:05.819 
rollout you see there's Manning in the
back<00:04:02.739> and<00:04:03.010> for<00:04:03.549> some<00:04:03.790> reason<00:04:04.319> when<00:04:05.319> he<00:04:05.500> throws

00:04:05.819 --> 00:04:05.829 
back and for some reason when he throws

00:04:05.829 --> 00:04:09.240 
back and for some reason when he throws
the<00:04:06.069> ball<00:04:06.250> both<00:04:07.120> pursuing<00:04:08.049> linebacker<00:04:08.890> and

00:04:09.240 --> 00:04:09.250 
the ball both pursuing linebacker and

00:04:09.250 --> 00:04:12.000 
the ball both pursuing linebacker and
cornerback<00:04:09.730> over<00:04:10.090> here<00:04:10.299> decide<00:04:11.019> to<00:04:11.319> stop<00:04:11.620> they

00:04:12.000 --> 00:04:12.010 
cornerback over here decide to stop they

00:04:12.010 --> 00:04:14.009 
cornerback over here decide to stop they
just<00:04:12.250> stopped<00:04:12.579> dead<00:04:13.030> in<00:04:13.060> their<00:04:13.209> tracks<00:04:13.329> and

00:04:14.009 --> 00:04:14.019 
just stopped dead in their tracks and

00:04:14.019 --> 00:04:18.779 
just stopped dead in their tracks and
move<00:04:14.950> backwards<00:04:15.579> and<00:04:15.930> then<00:04:16.930> reaper<00:04:17.680> sue<00:04:17.919> so

00:04:18.779 --> 00:04:18.789 
move backwards and then reaper sue so

00:04:18.789 --> 00:04:20.190 
move backwards and then reaper sue so
again<00:04:19.000> if<00:04:19.120> we're<00:04:19.269> going<00:04:19.389> to<00:04:19.479> implement<00:04:19.720> more

00:04:20.190 --> 00:04:20.200 
again if we're going to implement more

00:04:20.200 --> 00:04:22.140 
again if we're going to implement more
animations<00:04:20.829> and<00:04:21.070> more<00:04:21.220> user<00:04:21.519> control<00:04:21.639> of<00:04:22.060> the

00:04:22.140 --> 00:04:22.150 
animations and more user control of the

00:04:22.150 --> 00:04:24.300 
animations and more user control of the
offense<00:04:22.630> the<00:04:23.080> defense<00:04:23.110> really<00:04:23.740> needs<00:04:24.039> to<00:04:24.190> be

00:04:24.300 --> 00:04:24.310 
offense the defense really needs to be

00:04:24.310 --> 00:04:26.370 
offense the defense really needs to be
up<00:04:24.400> to<00:04:24.760> par<00:04:24.789> because<00:04:25.330> now<00:04:25.599> this<00:04:26.110> has<00:04:26.349> changed

00:04:26.370 --> 00:04:26.380 
up to par because now this has changed

00:04:26.380 --> 00:04:28.200 
up to par because now this has changed
the<00:04:26.950> pursuit<00:04:27.280> angles<00:04:27.639> of<00:04:27.760> both<00:04:27.910> of<00:04:27.940> these

00:04:28.200 --> 00:04:28.210 
the pursuit angles of both of these

00:04:28.210 --> 00:04:30.570 
the pursuit angles of both of these
players<00:04:28.539> who<00:04:29.110> at<00:04:29.260> this<00:04:29.440> point<00:04:29.560> were<00:04:30.370> the

00:04:30.570 --> 00:04:30.580 
players who at this point were the

00:04:30.580 --> 00:04:32.850 
players who at this point were the
closest<00:04:31.240> to<00:04:31.389> making<00:04:31.720> a<00:04:31.810> play<00:04:32.020> on<00:04:32.200> the<00:04:32.229> ball<00:04:32.380> or

00:04:32.850 --> 00:04:32.860 
closest to making a play on the ball or

00:04:32.860 --> 00:04:35.159 
closest to making a play on the ball or
college<00:04:33.610> that<00:04:33.789> he<00:04:33.880> would<00:04:34.060> catch<00:04:34.270> it<00:04:34.479> so<00:04:35.050> now

00:04:35.159 --> 00:04:35.169 
college that he would catch it so now

00:04:35.169 --> 00:04:37.500 
college that he would catch it so now
after<00:04:35.380> he's<00:04:35.710> made<00:04:35.889> the<00:04:36.070> catch<00:04:36.310> gonna<00:04:37.120> see<00:04:37.360> how

00:04:37.500 --> 00:04:37.510 
after he's made the catch gonna see how

00:04:37.510 --> 00:04:39.420 
after he's made the catch gonna see how
he<00:04:37.570> reacts<00:04:38.110> first<00:04:38.470> of<00:04:38.620> all<00:04:38.740> up<00:04:38.889> here<00:04:39.070> you<00:04:39.250> see

00:04:39.420 --> 00:04:39.430 
he reacts first of all up here you see

00:04:39.430 --> 00:04:43.140 
he reacts first of all up here you see
this<00:04:39.639> pirouette<00:04:40.630> by<00:04:40.960> this<00:04:41.139> defender<00:04:41.910> to<00:04:42.910> come

00:04:43.140 --> 00:04:43.150 
this pirouette by this defender to come

00:04:43.150 --> 00:04:44.580 
this pirouette by this defender to come
down<00:04:43.330> and<00:04:43.510> try<00:04:43.599> to<00:04:43.690> make<00:04:43.870> the<00:04:44.050> tackle<00:04:44.289> again

00:04:44.580 --> 00:04:44.590 
down and try to make the tackle again

00:04:44.590 --> 00:04:46.980 
down and try to make the tackle again
he's<00:04:44.770> not<00:04:44.950> looking<00:04:45.490> at<00:04:45.669> the<00:04:45.700> bulk<00:04:46.090> carrier<00:04:46.539> for

00:04:46.980 --> 00:04:46.990 
he's not looking at the bulk carrier for

00:04:46.990 --> 00:04:48.960 
he's not looking at the bulk carrier for
a<00:04:47.020> majority<00:04:47.169> of<00:04:47.620> this<00:04:47.800> in<00:04:48.039> terms<00:04:48.760> of

00:04:48.960 --> 00:04:48.970 
a majority of this in terms of

00:04:48.970 --> 00:04:52.140 
a majority of this in terms of
procedural<00:04:49.479> awareness<00:04:50.010> the<00:04:51.010> path<00:04:51.610> he<00:04:51.639> takes

00:04:52.140 --> 00:04:52.150 
procedural awareness the path he takes

00:04:52.150 --> 00:04:55.379 
procedural awareness the path he takes
is<00:04:52.389> not<00:04:52.720> one<00:04:53.169> continuous<00:04:53.919> solid<00:04:54.550> path<00:04:54.789> and

00:04:55.379 --> 00:04:55.389 
is not one continuous solid path and

00:04:55.389 --> 00:04:58.710 
is not one continuous solid path and
what<00:04:55.539> happens<00:04:55.930> is<00:04:56.139> as<00:04:56.700> Gonzalez<00:04:57.700> goes<00:04:58.000> to

00:04:58.710 --> 00:04:58.720 
what happens is as Gonzalez goes to

00:04:58.720 --> 00:05:00.930 
what happens is as Gonzalez goes to
execute<00:04:59.169> a<00:04:59.260> spin<00:04:59.560> move<00:04:59.800> you<00:05:00.340> can<00:05:00.490> see<00:05:00.700> it

00:05:00.930 --> 00:05:00.940 
execute a spin move you can see it

00:05:00.940 --> 00:05:02.820 
execute a spin move you can see it
affects<00:05:01.330> the<00:05:01.539> defensive<00:05:02.080> back<00:05:02.229> long<00:05:02.590> before

00:05:02.820 --> 00:05:02.830 
affects the defensive back long before

00:05:02.830 --> 00:05:06.029 
affects the defensive back long before
it<00:05:03.610> affects<00:05:03.970> Kali<00:05:04.389> and<00:05:05.139> see<00:05:05.289> there's<00:05:05.530> the<00:05:05.740> spin

00:05:06.029 --> 00:05:06.039 
it affects Kali and see there's the spin

00:05:06.039 --> 00:05:08.190 
it affects Kali and see there's the spin
move<00:05:06.250> okay<00:05:07.030> and<00:05:07.270> now<00:05:07.389> the<00:05:07.450> defensive<00:05:08.050> back

00:05:08.190 --> 00:05:08.200 
move okay and now the defensive back

00:05:08.200 --> 00:05:11.370 
move okay and now the defensive back
really<00:05:08.950> doesn't<00:05:09.160> know<00:05:09.400> what<00:05:09.580> to<00:05:09.729> do<00:05:10.110> the<00:05:11.110> game

00:05:11.370 --> 00:05:11.380 
really doesn't know what to do the game

00:05:11.380 --> 00:05:13.920 
really doesn't know what to do the game
can<00:05:11.710> handle<00:05:12.400> Austin<00:05:13.000> Collie<00:05:13.210> putting<00:05:13.599> a<00:05:13.660> spin

00:05:13.920 --> 00:05:13.930 
can handle Austin Collie putting a spin

00:05:13.930 --> 00:05:16.379 
can handle Austin Collie putting a spin
move<00:05:13.990> on<00:05:14.320> on<00:05:14.530> the<00:05:15.130> safety<00:05:15.580> at<00:05:15.880> this<00:05:16.060> point<00:05:16.300> in

00:05:16.379 --> 00:05:16.389 
move on on the safety at this point in

00:05:16.389 --> 00:05:19.050 
move on on the safety at this point in
the<00:05:16.479> game<00:05:16.510> so<00:05:17.410> what<00:05:17.560> happens<00:05:17.949> is<00:05:18.220> they<00:05:18.669> kind<00:05:18.940> of

00:05:19.050 --> 00:05:19.060 
the game so what happens is they kind of

00:05:19.060 --> 00:05:21.570 
the game so what happens is they kind of
motion<00:05:19.449> shift<00:05:19.690> through<00:05:19.960> each<00:05:20.110> other<00:05:20.380> and<00:05:20.650> then

00:05:21.570 --> 00:05:21.580 
motion shift through each other and then

00:05:21.580 --> 00:05:23.850 
motion shift through each other and then
an<00:05:21.820> exaggerated<00:05:22.810> miss<00:05:23.169> tackle<00:05:23.650> on<00:05:23.770> the

00:05:23.850 --> 00:05:23.860 
an exaggerated miss tackle on the

00:05:23.860 --> 00:05:25.529 
an exaggerated miss tackle on the
opposite<00:05:24.400> side<00:05:24.669> that<00:05:25.090> he<00:05:25.210> should<00:05:25.390> have<00:05:25.479> been

00:05:25.529 --> 00:05:25.539 
opposite side that he should have been

00:05:25.539 --> 00:05:27.220 
opposite side that he should have been
grabbing<00:05:25.870> to<00:05:26.140> begin<00:05:26.409> with

00:05:27.220 --> 00:05:27.230 
grabbing to begin with

00:05:27.230 --> 00:05:28.960 
grabbing to begin with
and<00:05:27.350> then<00:05:27.590> he<00:05:27.680> tries<00:05:28.070> to<00:05:28.280> gain<00:05:28.430> his<00:05:28.610> balance

00:05:28.960 --> 00:05:28.970 
and then he tries to gain his balance

00:05:28.970 --> 00:05:31.600 
and then he tries to gain his balance
and<00:05:29.090> run<00:05:29.330> back<00:05:29.590> so<00:05:30.590> to<00:05:30.650> me<00:05:31.070> if<00:05:31.220> I'm<00:05:31.370> going<00:05:31.550> to

00:05:31.600 --> 00:05:31.610 
and run back so to me if I'm going to

00:05:31.610 --> 00:05:33.400 
and run back so to me if I'm going to
have<00:05:31.730> more<00:05:32.000> control<00:05:32.210> this<00:05:32.570> is<00:05:32.630> just<00:05:32.960> a<00:05:33.050> simple

00:05:33.400 --> 00:05:33.410 
have more control this is just a simple

00:05:33.410 --> 00:05:36.370 
have more control this is just a simple
one-button<00:05:33.920> spin<00:05:34.790> and<00:05:35.060> this<00:05:35.720> is<00:05:35.870> what<00:05:36.050> it<00:05:36.140> does

00:05:36.370 --> 00:05:36.380 
one-button spin and this is what it does

00:05:36.380 --> 00:05:39.220 
one-button spin and this is what it does
to<00:05:36.680> the<00:05:37.130> secondary<00:05:37.610> now<00:05:37.910> maybe<00:05:38.720> it's<00:05:38.930> a<00:05:39.080> moot

00:05:39.220 --> 00:05:39.230 
to the secondary now maybe it's a moot

00:05:39.230 --> 00:05:41.470 
to the secondary now maybe it's a moot
point<00:05:39.260> because<00:05:39.650> 21<00:05:40.460> and<00:05:40.580> 25<00:05:41.000> we're<00:05:41.270> here<00:05:41.390> to

00:05:41.470 --> 00:05:41.480 
point because 21 and 25 we're here to

00:05:41.480 --> 00:05:45.580 
point because 21 and 25 we're here to
clean<00:05:41.540> up<00:05:42.490> the<00:05:43.490> play<00:05:43.760> but<00:05:44.570> the<00:05:44.780> issue<00:05:44.900> is<00:05:45.140> these

00:05:45.580 --> 00:05:45.590 
clean up the play but the issue is these

00:05:45.590 --> 00:05:47.230 
clean up the play but the issue is these
two<00:05:45.830> would<00:05:45.950> have<00:05:46.040> been<00:05:46.160> a<00:05:46.190> lot<00:05:46.430> closer<00:05:46.820> had

00:05:47.230 --> 00:05:47.240 
two would have been a lot closer had

00:05:47.240 --> 00:05:51.970 
two would have been a lot closer had
they<00:05:47.390> not<00:05:47.540> had<00:05:47.600> to<00:05:48.020> do<00:05:48.200> this<00:05:48.380> stuff<00:05:49.930> in<00:05:50.980> order

00:05:51.970 --> 00:05:51.980 
they not had to do this stuff in order

00:05:51.980 --> 00:05:53.590 
they not had to do this stuff in order
to<00:05:52.190> react<00:05:52.490> to<00:05:52.670> the<00:05:52.760> place<00:05:52.940> so<00:05:53.090> this<00:05:53.300> is<00:05:53.450> the

00:05:53.590 --> 00:05:53.600 
to react to the place so this is the

00:05:53.600 --> 00:05:56.200 
to react to the place so this is the
stuff<00:05:53.870> that<00:05:54.110> makes<00:05:54.560> me<00:05:54.800> wonder<00:05:55.040> you<00:05:55.340> know<00:05:55.790> what

00:05:56.200 --> 00:05:56.210 
stuff that makes me wonder you know what

00:05:56.210 --> 00:05:58.750 
stuff that makes me wonder you know what
adding<00:05:56.780> all<00:05:56.960> kinds<00:05:57.290> of<00:05:57.350> offensive<00:05:58.040> control<00:05:58.520> is

00:05:58.750 --> 00:05:58.760 
adding all kinds of offensive control is

00:05:58.760 --> 00:06:01.090 
adding all kinds of offensive control is
going<00:05:58.940> to<00:05:59.000> bring<00:05:59.270> when<00:05:59.840> the<00:05:59.930> defense<00:06:00.380> really

00:06:01.090 --> 00:06:01.100 
going to bring when the defense really

00:06:01.100 --> 00:06:03.250 
going to bring when the defense really
as<00:06:01.400> a<00:06:01.430> whole<00:06:01.760> can't<00:06:02.180> seem<00:06:02.390> to<00:06:02.540> handle<00:06:02.780> the<00:06:03.050> game

00:06:03.250 --> 00:06:03.260 
as a whole can't seem to handle the game

00:06:03.260 --> 00:06:05.530 
as a whole can't seem to handle the game
right<00:06:03.530> now<00:06:03.560> with<00:06:04.310> its<00:06:04.490> very<00:06:04.700> elementary

00:06:05.530 --> 00:06:05.540 
right now with its very elementary

00:06:05.540 --> 00:06:07.990 
right now with its very elementary
animations<00:06:06.340> so<00:06:07.340> I'm<00:06:07.400> going<00:06:07.430> to<00:06:07.550> play<00:06:07.730> this<00:06:07.760> at

00:06:07.990 --> 00:06:08.000 
animations so I'm going to play this at

00:06:08.000 --> 00:06:09.880 
animations so I'm going to play this at
one<00:06:08.150> time<00:06:08.360> its<00:06:08.600> speed<00:06:08.810> from<00:06:09.050> kali<00:06:09.320> and<00:06:09.680> just

00:06:09.880 --> 00:06:09.890 
one time its speed from kali and just

00:06:09.890 --> 00:06:12.450 
one time its speed from kali and just
you<00:06:10.280> know<00:06:10.310> compare<00:06:10.790> how<00:06:10.970> smooth<00:06:11.450> this<00:06:11.810> game<00:06:12.080> is

00:06:12.450 --> 00:06:12.460 
you know compare how smooth this game is

00:06:12.460 --> 00:06:14.830 
you know compare how smooth this game is
with<00:06:13.460> all<00:06:13.610> pro<00:06:13.820> football<00:06:14.210> I<00:06:14.240> mean<00:06:14.450> this<00:06:14.570> game

00:06:14.830 --> 00:06:14.840 
with all pro football I mean this game

00:06:14.840 --> 00:06:17.560 
with all pro football I mean this game
is<00:06:15.080> very<00:06:15.380> clunky<00:06:15.860> it's<00:06:16.670> almost<00:06:16.940> as<00:06:17.270> if<00:06:17.300> these

00:06:17.560 --> 00:06:17.570 
is very clunky it's almost as if these

00:06:17.570 --> 00:06:20.440 
is very clunky it's almost as if these
players<00:06:17.900> have<00:06:18.200> a<00:06:18.260> grid<00:06:18.770> to<00:06:19.490> run<00:06:19.730> on<00:06:19.910> and<00:06:20.120> they

00:06:20.440 --> 00:06:20.450 
players have a grid to run on and they

00:06:20.450 --> 00:06:22.330 
players have a grid to run on and they
have<00:06:20.630> to<00:06:20.780> run<00:06:20.930> these<00:06:21.140> awkward<00:06:21.440> 90-degree

00:06:22.330 --> 00:06:22.340 
have to run these awkward 90-degree

00:06:22.340 --> 00:06:25.060 
have to run these awkward 90-degree
grids<00:06:22.640> at<00:06:22.790> all<00:06:22.880> times<00:06:23.180> so<00:06:23.510> to<00:06:23.990> me<00:06:24.110> a<00:06:24.320> very<00:06:24.650> good

00:06:25.060 --> 00:06:25.070 
grids at all times so to me a very good

00:06:25.070 --> 00:06:26.980 
grids at all times so to me a very good
example<00:06:25.190> of<00:06:25.820> how<00:06:26.180> all<00:06:26.390> pro<00:06:26.570> football

00:06:26.980 --> 00:06:26.990 
example of how all pro football

00:06:26.990 --> 00:06:28.810 
example of how all pro football
replicates<00:06:27.650> Madden<00:06:28.070> better<00:06:28.250> this<00:06:28.520> isn't

00:06:28.810 --> 00:06:28.820 
replicates Madden better this isn't

00:06:28.820 --> 00:06:30.190 
replicates Madden better this isn't
meant<00:06:28.910> to<00:06:28.970> bash<00:06:29.210> matter<00:06:29.570> this<00:06:29.750> is<00:06:29.930> just<00:06:30.080> to

00:06:30.190 --> 00:06:30.200 
meant to bash matter this is just to

00:06:30.200 --> 00:06:32.860 
meant to bash matter this is just to
show<00:06:30.260> you<00:06:30.500> there's<00:06:31.490> no<00:06:31.820> excuse<00:06:32.330> for<00:06:32.360> this<00:06:32.540> game

00:06:32.860 --> 00:06:32.870 
show you there's no excuse for this game

00:06:32.870 --> 00:06:36.190 
show you there's no excuse for this game
to<00:06:33.260> be<00:06:33.560> acting<00:06:34.100> this<00:06:34.130> way<00:06:34.280> when<00:06:35.210> a<00:06:35.450> game<00:06:35.750> for

to be acting this way when a game for

00:06:36.200 --> 00:06:38.130 
to be acting this way when a game for
years<00:06:36.440> and<00:06:36.770> six<00:06:37.100> years<00:06:37.370> older<00:06:37.760> than<00:06:37.880> it
