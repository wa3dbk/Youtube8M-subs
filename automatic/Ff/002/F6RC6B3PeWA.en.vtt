00:03:12.900 --> 00:03:12.910 
gave it a really big view review and

00:03:12.910 --> 00:03:14.130 
gave it a really big view review and
once<00:03:13.060> i<00:03:13.180> start<00:03:13.360> thinking<00:03:13.540> about<00:03:13.599> it<00:03:13.780> more<00:03:13.930> that

00:03:14.130 --> 00:03:14.140 
once i start thinking about it more that

00:03:14.140 --> 00:03:15.750 
once i start thinking about it more that
it<00:03:14.410> kind<00:03:14.769> of<00:03:14.860> lost<00:03:15.099> a<00:03:15.220> little<00:03:15.310> bit<00:03:15.430> in<00:03:15.549> tone

00:03:15.750 --> 00:03:15.760 
it kind of lost a little bit in tone

00:03:15.760 --> 00:03:17.910 
it kind of lost a little bit in tone
this<00:03:16.360> to<00:03:16.660> me<00:03:16.810> got<00:03:17.110> back<00:03:17.349> to<00:03:17.500> what<00:03:17.620> I<00:03:17.650> love<00:03:17.889> so

00:03:17.910 --> 00:03:17.920 
this to me got back to what I love so

00:03:17.920 --> 00:03:19.620 
this to me got back to what I love so
much<00:03:18.190> about<00:03:18.400> the<00:03:18.790> Winter<00:03:19.030> Soldier<00:03:19.269> more<00:03:19.600> I

00:03:19.620 --> 00:03:19.630 
much about the Winter Soldier more I

00:03:19.630 --> 00:03:21.210 
much about the Winter Soldier more I
thought<00:03:19.930> the<00:03:20.049> franchise<00:03:20.440> was<00:03:20.620> going<00:03:20.980> and<00:03:21.100> it

00:03:21.210 --> 00:03:21.220 
thought the franchise was going and it

00:03:21.220 --> 00:03:22.620 
thought the franchise was going and it
seems<00:03:21.549> like<00:03:21.790> the<00:03:21.940> Russo<00:03:22.209> brothers<00:03:22.239> have<00:03:22.600> a

00:03:22.620 --> 00:03:22.630 
seems like the Russo brothers have a

00:03:22.630 --> 00:03:24.090 
seems like the Russo brothers have a
good<00:03:22.900> hold<00:03:23.109> on<00:03:23.230> this<00:03:23.380> thing<00:03:23.530> because<00:03:23.739> it<00:03:23.829> felt

00:03:24.090 --> 00:03:24.100 
good hold on this thing because it felt

00:03:24.100 --> 00:03:26.160 
good hold on this thing because it felt
like<00:03:24.250> that<00:03:24.370> spy<00:03:24.670> thriller<00:03:25.000> again<00:03:25.269> mixed<00:03:25.959> with

00:03:26.160 --> 00:03:26.170 
like that spy thriller again mixed with

00:03:26.170 --> 00:03:27.960 
like that spy thriller again mixed with
the<00:03:26.680> Avengers<00:03:26.980> right<00:03:27.459> the<00:03:27.609> tone<00:03:27.790> of<00:03:27.819> the

00:03:27.960 --> 00:03:27.970
