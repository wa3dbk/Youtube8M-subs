this<00:00:33.600> would<00:00:33.690> be<00:00:33.750> the<00:00:33.899> best<00:00:34.020> way<00:00:34.110> to<00:00:34.230> try<00:00:34.410> and

00:00:34.430 --> 00:00:34.440 
this would be the best way to try and

00:00:34.440 --> 00:00:36.920 
this would be the best way to try and
shoot<00:00:34.710> it<00:00:34.800> up<00:00:34.920> play<00:00:35.910> it<00:00:35.969> on<00:00:36.120> YouTube<00:00:36.540> and<00:00:36.780> see

00:00:36.920 --> 00:00:36.930 
shoot it up play it on YouTube and see

00:00:36.930 --> 00:00:39.260 
shoot it up play it on YouTube and see

00:00:52.400 --> 00:00:52.410 
channel side by side and then I process

00:00:52.410 --> 00:00:55.580

00:04:38.390 --> 00:04:38.400 
unit direct in and now it's kind of hard

00:04:38.400 --> 00:04:39.649 
unit direct in and now it's kind of hard
to<00:04:38.430> hear<00:04:38.490> with<00:04:38.729> the<00:04:38.819> track<00:04:39.030> that<00:04:39.060> the<00:04:39.300> whole

00:04:41.119 --> 00:04:41.129 
thing is it's in the emphasis on how

00:04:41.129 --> 00:04:42.649 
thing is it's in the emphasis on how
much<00:04:41.250> it<00:04:41.400> really<00:04:41.490> can<00:04:41.759> blend<00:04:42.060> in<00:04:42.210> with<00:04:42.419> it<00:04:42.629> and

00:04:42.649 --> 00:04:42.659 
much it really can blend in with it and

00:04:42.659 --> 00:04:44.240 
much it really can blend in with it and
it's<00:04:43.169> not<00:04:43.319> overpowering<00:04:43.560> I<00:04:43.979> mean<00:04:44.099> they're

00:04:44.240 --> 00:04:44.250

00:04:44.250 --> 00:04:47.450 
it's not overpowering I mean they're
equal<00:04:44.550> doubt<00:04:44.699> on<00:04:44.879> decibel<00:04:45.270> levels<00:04:46.400> like<00:04:47.400> I

00:04:47.450 --> 00:04:47.460 
equal doubt on decibel levels like I

00:04:47.460 --> 00:04:48.619 
equal doubt on decibel levels like I
said<00:04:47.520> I'm<00:04:47.699> even<00:04:47.969> if<00:04:48.060> you<00:04:48.150> want<00:04:48.330> to<00:04:48.389> listen<00:04:48.509> to

you<00:05:00.180> can<00:05:00.330> use<00:05:00.360> some<00:05:00.479> of<00:05:00.689> these<00:05:00.750> high<00:05:00.960> gain<00:05:01.259> sort

00:05:01.580 --> 00:05:01.590 
you can use some of these high gain sort

00:05:01.590 --> 00:05:04.790 
you can use some of these high gain sort
of<00:05:01.680> effects<00:05:02.039> and<00:05:02.539> amps<00:05:03.539> and<00:05:03.780> it<00:05:04.530> really

00:05:04.790 --> 00:05:04.800 
of effects and amps and it really

00:05:04.800 --> 00:05:06.320 
of effects and amps and it really
doesn't<00:05:05.009> clutter<00:05:05.219> up<00:05:05.400> or<00:05:05.490> get<00:05:05.610> too<00:05:05.789> muddy<00:05:06.060> as

00:05:06.320 --> 00:05:06.330 
doesn't clutter up or get too muddy as

00:05:06.330 --> 00:05:08.779 
doesn't clutter up or get too muddy as
long<00:05:07.050> as<00:05:07.169> you<00:05:07.259> doubt<00:05:07.409> it<00:05:07.440> incorrectly<00:05:08.039> so<00:05:08.490> even

00:05:08.779 --> 00:05:08.789 
long as you doubt it incorrectly so even

00:05:08.789 --> 00:05:10.309 
long as you doubt it incorrectly so even
for<00:05:09.030> some<00:05:09.180> of<00:05:09.270> those<00:05:09.330> parts<00:05:09.719> i<00:05:09.810> can<00:05:09.930> get<00:05:10.080> kind

00:05:10.309 --> 00:05:10.319 
for some of those parts i can get kind

00:05:10.319 --> 00:05:12.950 
for some of those parts i can get kind
of<00:05:10.440> I<00:05:10.740> guess<00:05:11.190> somewhat<00:05:11.819> technical<00:05:11.940> it's<00:05:12.780> more

00:05:12.950 --> 00:05:12.960 
of I guess somewhat technical it's more

00:05:12.960 --> 00:05:14.839 
of I guess somewhat technical it's more
so<00:05:13.139> cluttered<00:05:13.500> is<00:05:13.800> what<00:05:14.039> it<00:05:14.129> really<00:05:14.280> is<00:05:14.400> as

00:05:14.839 --> 00:05:14.849 
so cluttered is what it really is as

00:05:14.849 --> 00:05:17.180 
so cluttered is what it really is as
long<00:05:15.569> as<00:05:15.629> you<00:05:15.810> have<00:05:15.990> it<00:05:16.110> set<00:05:16.139> up<00:05:16.319> correctly<00:05:16.560> and
