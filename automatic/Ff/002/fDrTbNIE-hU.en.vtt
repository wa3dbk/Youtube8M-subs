two liquids together to create my white

00:02:13.880 --> 00:02:16.390

I've<00:02:21.050> got<00:02:21.290> the<00:02:21.410> white<00:02:21.560> wine<00:02:21.890> reduction<00:02:22.100> here

00:02:24.810 --> 00:02:24.820 
I've got the white wine reduction here

00:02:24.820 --> 00:02:26.860 
I've got the white wine reduction here
and<00:02:25.820> what<00:02:25.940> I'm<00:02:26.060> going<00:02:26.150> to<00:02:26.209> do<00:02:26.360> is<00:02:26.480> just<00:02:26.660> blend

00:02:26.860 --> 00:02:26.870 
and what I'm going to do is just blend

00:02:26.870 --> 00:02:29.860 
and what I'm going to do is just blend
the<00:02:27.080> two<00:02:27.260> together<00:02:27.470> until<00:02:28.330> I<00:02:29.330> get<00:02:29.540> a<00:02:29.570> flavor

00:02:29.860 --> 00:02:29.870 
the two together until I get a flavor

00:02:29.870 --> 00:02:34.960 
the two together until I get a flavor
that<00:02:30.380> I'm<00:02:30.860> happy<00:02:31.280> with<00:02:31.310> now<00:02:32.030> although<00:02:32.350> the<00:02:33.970> the

00:02:34.960 --> 00:02:34.970 
that I'm happy with now although the the

00:02:34.970 --> 00:02:36.610 
that I'm happy with now although the the
stock<00:02:35.270> will<00:02:35.540> be<00:02:35.570> a<00:02:35.690> lot<00:02:35.870> thicker<00:02:36.140> when<00:02:36.470> it's

00:02:36.610 --> 00:02:36.620 
stock will be a lot thicker when it's

00:02:36.620 --> 00:02:38.710 
stock will be a lot thicker when it's
reduced<00:02:37.040> down<00:02:37.310> the<00:02:37.970> white<00:02:38.180> wine<00:02:38.390> won't

00:02:38.710 --> 00:02:38.720 
reduced down the white wine won't

00:02:38.720 --> 00:02:42.850 
reduced down the white wine won't
because<00:02:39.709> there's<00:02:39.890> no<00:02:40.010> gelatine<00:02:40.520> in<00:02:40.790> it<00:02:41.860> right

00:02:42.850 --> 00:02:42.860 
because there's no gelatine in it right

00:02:42.860 --> 00:02:44.520 
because there's no gelatine in it right
so<00:02:43.010> I'm<00:02:43.100> just<00:02:43.160> going<00:02:43.340> to<00:02:43.400> add<00:02:43.550> a<00:02:43.580> tiny<00:02:43.880> bit<00:02:44.060> more

00:02:44.520 --> 00:02:44.530 
so I'm just going to add a tiny bit more

00:02:44.530 --> 00:02:52.260 
so I'm just going to add a tiny bit more
of<00:02:45.530> the<00:02:45.920> white<00:02:46.520> wine<00:02:47.770> reduction<00:02:49.060> and<00:02:50.680> then

00:02:52.260 --> 00:02:52.270 
of the white wine reduction and then

00:02:52.270 --> 00:02:56.350 
of the white wine reduction and then
just<00:02:53.270> for<00:02:53.420> effect<00:02:53.830> that<00:02:54.830> goes<00:02:55.160> on<00:02:55.850> top<00:02:56.120> of<00:02:56.300> the

00:02:56.350 --> 00:02:56.360 
just for effect that goes on top of the

00:02:56.360 --> 00:02:58.090 
just for effect that goes on top of the
chicken<00:02:56.600> and<00:02:57.020> that's<00:02:57.410> how<00:02:57.560> you<00:02:57.620> make<00:02:57.860> chicken

00:02:58.090 --> 00:02:58.100 
chicken and that's how you make chicken

00:02:58.100 --> 00:03:01.209 
chicken and that's how you make chicken
with<00:02:58.459> white<00:02:58.640> wine<00:02:58.880> sauce
