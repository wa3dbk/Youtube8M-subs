00:01:09.160 --> 00:01:12.840 
let's try it with the dog right left
turn<00:01:10.080> you<00:01:11.080> can<00:01:11.230> see<00:01:11.380> it<00:01:11.680> becomes<00:01:12.160> an<00:01:12.400> extra

00:01:12.840 --> 00:01:12.850 
turn you can see it becomes an extra

00:01:12.850 --> 00:01:15.840 
turn you can see it becomes an extra
cute<00:01:13.150> and<00:01:13.380> obedience<00:01:14.380> you<00:01:14.710> can't<00:01:15.070> talk<00:01:15.640> to

00:01:15.840 --> 00:01:15.850

00:01:19.920 --> 00:01:19.930 
so this body language is very important

00:01:19.930 --> 00:01:25.350 
so this body language is very important
a<00:01:20.170> right<00:01:20.860> turn<00:01:22.290> it<00:01:23.290> a<00:01:23.710> lot<00:01:24.640> of<00:01:24.790> people<00:01:25.060> will<00:01:25.210> do

00:01:36.480 --> 00:01:36.490 
such a lagger but now I found that I'm

00:01:36.490 --> 00:01:38.999 
such a lagger but now I found that I'm
much<00:01:36.700> more<00:01:36.940> comfortable<00:01:37.530> just<00:01:38.530> doing<00:01:38.890> a

00:01:38.999 --> 00:01:39.009 
much more comfortable just doing a

00:01:39.009 --> 00:01:42.270 
much more comfortable just doing a
diagonal<00:01:39.520> plant<00:01:40.210> step<00:01:40.630> coming<00:01:41.590> around<00:01:41.979> and

00:01:42.270 --> 00:01:42.280 
diagonal plant step coming around and

diagonal plant step coming around and
taking<00:01:43.060> a<00:01:43.149> small<00:01:43.450> step<00:01:43.630> as<00:01:43.930> I<00:01:44.050> come<00:01:44.259> out<00:01:44.380> with

00:01:44.430 --> 00:01:44.440 
taking a small step as I come out with

00:01:44.440 --> 00:01:49.340 
taking a small step as I come out with
commas<00:01:45.600> here<00:01:46.600> we<00:01:46.690> go<00:01:46.840> right<00:01:47.470> turn<00:01:47.979> plant<00:01:48.670> step

00:01:49.340 --> 00:01:49.350 
commas here we go right turn plant step

00:01:49.350 --> 00:01:52.500 
commas here we go right turn plant step
forward

00:01:52.500 --> 00:01:52.510 

00:01:52.510 --> 00:01:57.870 

begin<00:01:53.260> it<00:01:53.670> it's<00:01:54.670> not<00:01:54.970> judged<00:01:56.520> unless<00:01:57.520> the<00:01:57.700> dog

wagging or they're foraging or they're
bumping<00:02:01.330> into<00:02:01.540> you<00:02:01.720> that<00:02:02.320> will<00:02:02.650> be<00:02:02.770> much<00:02:03.070> on

00:02:03.740 --> 00:02:03.750 
bumping into you that will be much on

00:02:03.750 --> 00:02:08.340 
bumping into you that will be much on
about<00:02:04.750> turns<00:02:05.230> I<00:02:05.800> can<00:02:06.670> to<00:02:06.820> do<00:02:07.000> a<00:02:07.330> kind<00:02:08.140> of<00:02:08.200> a

00:02:08.340 --> 00:02:08.350 
about turns I can to do a kind of a

00:02:08.350 --> 00:02:14.970 
about turns I can to do a kind of a
double<00:02:09.119> right<00:02:10.119> turn<00:02:11.370> plant<00:02:12.480> plant<00:02:13.980> and

00:02:14.970 --> 00:02:14.980 
double right turn plant plant and

00:02:14.980 --> 00:02:19.230 
double right turn plant plant and
forward<00:02:15.490> plant<00:02:15.930> plant<00:02:16.930> and<00:02:17.460> forward<00:02:18.460> it<00:02:18.880> gives

00:02:19.230 --> 00:02:19.240 
forward plant plant and forward it gives

00:02:19.240 --> 00:02:21.570 
forward plant plant and forward it gives
the<00:02:19.420> dog<00:02:19.750> time<00:02:20.140> to<00:02:20.500> get<00:02:20.740> around<00:02:21.040> me<00:02:21.250> on<00:02:21.400> the

00:02:21.570 --> 00:02:21.580 
the dog time to get around me on the

00:02:21.580 --> 00:02:24.930 
the dog time to get around me on the
right<00:02:21.820> the<00:02:22.420> dog<00:02:22.660> has<00:02:23.020> to<00:02:23.050> go<00:02:23.440> further<00:02:24.190> around

00:02:24.930 --> 00:02:24.940 
right the dog has to go further around

00:02:24.940 --> 00:02:29.300 
right the dog has to go further around
so<00:02:25.510> they've<00:02:25.720> got<00:02:25.990> to<00:02:26.170> speed<00:02:26.470> up<00:02:26.500> on<00:02:26.860> the<00:02:27.370> left

00:02:29.300 --> 00:02:29.310 
so they've got to speed up on the left

00:02:29.310 --> 00:02:34.260

on this you exercise description does

00:06:00.030 --> 00:06:02.180 
on this you exercise description does
not<00:06:00.270> say<00:06:00.600> you<00:06:00.660> have<00:06:01.050> to<00:06:01.230> take<00:06:01.440> that<00:06:01.620> step<00:06:01.920> with

your<00:06:02.340> right<00:06:02.400> foot<00:06:02.610> sit<00:06:03.120> so<00:06:04.050> some<00:06:04.320> people

00:06:06.590 --> 00:06:06.600 
your right foot sit so some people

00:06:06.600 --> 00:06:11.050 
your right foot sit so some people
take<00:06:07.170> the<00:06:07.320> step<00:06:07.590> with<00:06:07.800> the<00:06:07.830> left<00:06:08.100> foot<00:06:08.340> you

00:06:11.050 --> 00:06:11.060 

00:06:11.060 --> 00:06:14.770 

get<00:06:11.690> and<00:06:12.139> that's<00:06:12.800> fine<00:06:13.330> so<00:06:14.330> I<00:06:14.360> said<00:06:14.630> there<00:06:14.750> are

00:06:14.770 --> 00:06:14.780 
get and that's fine so I said there are

00:06:14.780 --> 00:06:17.050 
get and that's fine so I said there are
times<00:06:15.260> when<00:06:15.620> your<00:06:15.770> footwork<00:06:16.190> will<00:06:16.550> be<00:06:16.760> judged

00:06:17.050 --> 00:06:17.060 
times when your footwork will be judged

00:06:17.060 --> 00:06:19.180 
times when your footwork will be judged
and<00:06:17.360> there<00:06:17.960> are<00:06:18.020> other<00:06:18.169> times<00:06:18.470> when<00:06:18.740> it's<00:06:18.889> not

00:06:19.180 --> 00:06:19.190 
and there are other times when it's not

00:06:19.190 --> 00:06:28.480 
and there are other times when it's not
judged<00:06:19.610> but<00:06:20.030> it's<00:06:20.180> equally<00:06:20.660> important

00:06:28.480 --> 00:06:28.490 

00:06:28.490 --> 00:06:31.250 

this<00:06:29.490> is<00:06:29.730> probably<00:06:30.060> the<00:06:30.270> most<00:06:30.540> important

00:06:31.250 --> 00:06:31.260 
this is probably the most important

00:06:31.260 --> 00:06:34.280 
this is probably the most important
footwork<00:06:31.710> of<00:06:31.950> all<00:06:32.160> and<00:06:32.490> this<00:06:33.420> is<00:06:33.630> what<00:06:33.810> I<00:06:33.840> see

00:06:34.280 --> 00:06:34.290

footwork of all and this is what I see
and<00:06:34.590> this<00:06:34.770> is<00:06:34.830> what<00:06:34.980> I<00:06:35.370> do<00:06:35.430> I<00:06:36.030> know<00:06:37.250> he'll<00:06:39.230> what

00:06:40.220 --> 00:06:40.230 
and this is what I do I know he'll what

00:06:40.230 --> 00:06:42.320
