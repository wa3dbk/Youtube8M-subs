00:01:06.440 --> 00:01:06.450 
range than his crouch medium punch so it

00:01:06.450 --> 00:01:08.270 
range than his crouch medium punch so it
ranges<00:01:06.659> where<00:01:07.049> his<00:01:07.380> his<00:01:07.799> stand<00:01:08.010> we<00:01:08.130> don't

punch<00:01:08.490> might<00:01:08.880> not<00:01:09.090> hit<00:01:09.270> right<00:01:10.020> here<00:01:11.540> probably

00:01:12.530 --> 00:01:12.540 
punch might not hit right here probably

00:01:12.540 --> 00:01:14.750 
punch might not hit right here probably
right<00:01:12.900> here<00:01:12.930> his<00:01:13.770> Crouch<00:01:14.010> medium<00:01:14.369> punch<00:01:14.520> will

00:01:14.750 --> 00:01:14.760 
right here his Crouch medium punch will

00:01:14.760 --> 00:01:16.280 
right here his Crouch medium punch will
hit<00:01:14.970> so<00:01:15.299> has<00:01:15.450> a<00:01:15.479> little<00:01:15.689> bit<00:01:15.780> more<00:01:15.900> range<00:01:16.140> as

00:01:16.280 --> 00:01:16.290 
hit so has a little bit more range as

00:01:16.290 --> 00:01:18.260 
hit so has a little bit more range as
you<00:01:16.380> saw<00:01:16.560> there<00:01:16.770> and<00:01:16.920> his<00:01:17.729> crotch<00:01:17.970> a<00:01:18.030> medium

00:01:18.270 --> 00:01:19.940 
you saw there and his crotch a medium

00:01:19.950 --> 00:01:21.740 
punch I think is the best normal to
puffer<00:01:20.310> things<00:01:20.520> in<00:01:20.700> -<00:01:20.850> it's<00:01:21.330> really<00:01:21.509> good

a<00:01:25.320> little<00:01:25.500> bit<00:01:25.619> slower<00:01:25.890> and<00:01:26.130> his<00:01:26.640> Crouch<00:01:26.970> heavy

00:01:27.230 --> 00:01:27.240

but yeah his kick normals don't seem to
be<00:01:58.920> that<00:01:59.070> great<00:01:59.310> they're<00:01:59.880> not<00:02:00.030> chainable<00:02:00.420> like

00:02:00.709 --> 00:02:00.719 
be that great they're not chainable like

his<00:02:00.960> light<00:02:01.560> punch<00:02:01.860> or<00:02:02.159> light<00:02:02.700> kick<00:02:02.969> his<00:02:03.479> his

00:02:04.010 --> 00:02:04.020 
his light punch or light kick his his

00:02:04.020 --> 00:02:06.260 
his light punch or light kick his his
light<00:02:04.229> normals<00:02:04.590> are<00:02:04.710> but<00:02:05.280> they<00:02:05.850> don't<00:02:06.000> seem<00:02:06.149> to

00:02:06.260 --> 00:02:06.270 
light normals are but they don't seem to

00:02:06.270 --> 00:02:07.429 
light normals are but they don't seem to
be<00:02:06.360> that<00:02:06.509> great<00:02:06.719> they<00:02:06.869> don't<00:02:07.020> cover<00:02:07.170> that<00:02:07.259> much

00:02:07.429 --> 00:02:07.439 
be that great they don't cover that much

00:02:07.439 --> 00:02:08.749 
be that great they don't cover that much
distance<00:02:07.710> they're<00:02:08.160> just<00:02:08.340> interesting

00:02:08.749 --> 00:02:08.759 
distance they're just interesting

00:02:08.759 --> 00:02:11.029 
distance they're just interesting
looking<00:02:09.090> I<00:02:09.209> think<00:02:09.750> his<00:02:09.959> his<00:02:10.379> plunge<00:02:10.649> normals

00:02:11.029 --> 00:02:11.039 
looking I think his his plunge normals

00:02:11.039 --> 00:02:13.000 
looking I think his his plunge normals
seem<00:02:11.160> to<00:02:11.280> be<00:02:11.370> a<00:02:11.400> lot<00:02:11.550> better

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:13.010 
seem to be a lot better

00:02:13.010 --> 00:02:14.860 
seem to be a lot better
oh<00:02:13.069> yeah<00:02:13.700> his<00:02:13.879> jump<00:02:14.120> normal<00:02:14.450> is<00:02:14.540> his<00:02:14.659> jump

00:02:14.860 --> 00:02:14.870 
oh yeah his jump normal is his jump

00:02:14.870 --> 00:02:16.539 
oh yeah his jump normal is his jump
light<00:02:15.080> kick<00:02:15.319> has<00:02:15.799> this<00:02:15.920> little<00:02:16.189> range<00:02:16.370> right

00:02:16.539 --> 00:02:16.549 
light kick has this little range right

00:02:16.549 --> 00:02:19.750 
light kick has this little range right
here<00:02:16.900> his<00:02:17.900> jump<00:02:18.170> medium<00:02:18.500> kick<00:02:18.769> his

00:02:19.750 --> 00:02:19.760 
here his jump medium kick his

00:02:19.760 --> 00:02:21.699 
here his jump medium kick his
jump.heavy-kick<00:02:20.510> which<00:02:21.110> i<00:02:21.260> think<00:02:21.319> is<00:02:21.560> one<00:02:21.680> of

00:02:21.699 --> 00:02:21.709 
jump.heavy-kick which i think is one of

00:02:21.709 --> 00:02:23.440 
jump.heavy-kick which i think is one of
his<00:02:21.860> better<00:02:22.040> jump<00:02:22.370> ins<00:02:22.549> just<00:02:23.120> takes<00:02:23.269> some<00:02:23.420> time

00:02:23.440 --> 00:02:23.450 
his better jump ins just takes some time

00:02:23.450 --> 00:02:26.559 
his better jump ins just takes some time
to<00:02:23.689> come<00:02:23.840> out<00:02:23.989> his<00:02:24.769> jump<00:02:25.069> light<00:02:25.250> punch<00:02:25.569> jump

00:02:26.559 --> 00:02:26.569 
to come out his jump light punch jump

00:02:26.569 --> 00:02:28.750 
to come out his jump light punch jump
light<00:02:26.930> our<00:02:27.260> jump<00:02:27.590> medium<00:02:27.860> punch<00:02:28.040> and<00:02:28.310> jump

00:02:28.750 --> 00:02:28.760 
light our jump medium punch and jump

00:02:28.760 --> 00:02:30.789 
light our jump medium punch and jump
heavy<00:02:29.030> punch<00:02:29.299> which<00:02:29.959> is<00:02:30.110> really<00:02:30.440> like<00:02:30.680> his

00:02:30.789 --> 00:02:30.799 
heavy punch which is really like his

00:02:30.799 --> 00:02:32.170 
heavy punch which is really like his
jump<00:02:31.069> heavy<00:02:31.220> punches<00:02:31.640> it<00:02:31.700> seems<00:02:31.909> to<00:02:32.030> be<00:02:32.150> uh

00:02:32.170 --> 00:02:32.180 
jump heavy punches it seems to be uh

00:02:32.180 --> 00:02:34.149 
jump heavy punches it seems to be uh
really<00:02:33.019> good<00:02:33.230> for<00:02:33.409> maybe<00:02:33.560> for<00:02:33.769> air<00:02:33.890> there's

00:02:34.149 --> 00:02:34.159 
really good for maybe for air there's

00:02:34.159 --> 00:02:36.220 
really good for maybe for air there's
his<00:02:34.280> jump<00:02:34.489> medium<00:02:34.730> punch<00:02:34.940> as<00:02:35.239> has<00:02:35.810> like<00:02:35.989> no

00:02:36.220 --> 00:02:36.230 
his jump medium punch as has like no

00:02:36.230 --> 00:02:38.199 
his jump medium punch as has like no
hitbox<00:02:36.650> so<00:02:36.860> I<00:02:36.890> think<00:02:37.250> his<00:02:37.400> main<00:02:37.549> jumped<00:02:37.909> normal

00:02:38.199 --> 00:02:38.209 
hitbox so I think his main jumped normal

00:02:38.209 --> 00:02:40.300 
hitbox so I think his main jumped normal
is<00:02:38.299> probably<00:02:38.540> as<00:02:38.659> heavy<00:02:38.810> kick<00:02:39.099> but<00:02:40.099> I'm<00:02:40.190> not

00:02:40.300 --> 00:02:40.310 
is probably as heavy kick but I'm not

00:02:40.310 --> 00:02:41.740 
is probably as heavy kick but I'm not
entirely<00:02:40.549> sure<00:02:40.879> yet<00:02:41.030> that<00:02:41.239> could<00:02:41.329> be<00:02:41.480> false

00:02:41.740 --> 00:02:41.750 
entirely sure yet that could be false

00:02:41.750 --> 00:02:43.569 
entirely sure yet that could be false
but<00:02:42.079> that<00:02:42.409> seems<00:02:42.620> what<00:02:42.799> it<00:02:42.890> is<00:02:43.010> and<00:02:43.250> the<00:02:43.400> last

00:02:43.569 --> 00:02:43.579 
but that seems what it is and the last

00:02:43.579 --> 00:02:45.759 
but that seems what it is and the last
normal<00:02:43.790> I<00:02:43.939> want<00:02:44.120> to<00:02:44.180> talk<00:02:44.329> about<00:02:44.450> is<00:02:44.750> his<00:02:45.440> back

00:02:45.759 --> 00:02:45.769 
normal I want to talk about is his back

00:02:45.769 --> 00:02:47.619 
normal I want to talk about is his back
and<00:02:46.040> heavy<00:02:46.459> punch<00:02:46.730> this<00:02:46.879> is<00:02:47.000> command<00:02:47.329> normal

00:02:47.619 --> 00:02:47.629 
and heavy punch this is command normal

00:02:47.629 --> 00:02:49.030 
and heavy punch this is command normal
it<00:02:47.959> goes<00:02:48.140> like<00:02:48.349> this<00:02:48.470> it<00:02:48.680> moves<00:02:48.859> them<00:02:49.010> forward

00:02:49.030 --> 00:02:49.040 
it goes like this it moves them forward

00:02:49.040 --> 00:02:51.129 
it goes like this it moves them forward
a<00:02:49.310> lot<00:02:49.430> and<00:02:49.670> it's<00:02:50.120> really<00:02:50.480> good<00:02:50.810> as<00:02:50.959> you<00:02:51.049> can

00:02:51.129 --> 00:02:51.139 
a lot and it's really good as you can

00:02:51.139 --> 00:02:52.449 
a lot and it's really good as you can
see<00:02:51.319> they're<00:02:51.500> at<00:02:51.590> the<00:02:51.680> advantage<00:02:52.129> right<00:02:52.310> there

00:02:52.449 --> 00:02:52.459 
see they're at the advantage right there

00:02:52.459 --> 00:02:55.569 
see they're at the advantage right there
on<00:02:52.639> on<00:02:53.209> block<00:02:53.629> or<00:02:53.870> hit<00:02:54.139> it's<00:02:54.530> Super<00:02:54.950> Plus<00:02:55.099> right

00:02:55.569 --> 00:02:55.579 
on on block or hit it's Super Plus right

00:02:55.579 --> 00:02:57.460 
on on block or hit it's Super Plus right
so<00:02:56.450> it's<00:02:56.720> really<00:02:56.870> good<00:02:57.049> and<00:02:57.139> you<00:02:57.230> can<00:02:57.349> also

00:02:57.460 --> 00:02:57.470 
so it's really good and you can also

00:02:57.470 --> 00:02:58.809 
so it's really good and you can also
charge<00:02:57.799> it<00:02:57.980> up<00:02:58.099> all<00:02:58.340> the<00:02:58.459> way<00:02:58.579> and<00:02:58.730> it's

00:02:58.809 --> 00:02:58.819 
charge it up all the way and it's

00:02:58.819 --> 00:03:00.970 
charge it up all the way and it's
unblockable<00:02:59.269> like<00:02:59.510> that<00:02:59.690> as<00:02:59.840> you<00:02:59.959> can<00:03:00.049> see<00:03:00.109> but

00:03:00.970 --> 00:03:00.980 
unblockable like that as you can see but

00:03:00.980 --> 00:03:02.559 
unblockable like that as you can see but
the<00:03:01.069> nice<00:03:01.220> part<00:03:01.459> about<00:03:01.519> back<00:03:01.819> heavy<00:03:02.150> punch<00:03:02.359> is

00:03:02.559 --> 00:03:02.569 
the nice part about back heavy punch is

00:03:02.569 --> 00:03:05.110 
the nice part about back heavy punch is
that<00:03:02.780> you<00:03:02.930> can<00:03:03.109> hit<00:03:03.319> confirm<00:03:03.680> it<00:03:04.040> or<00:03:04.430> see<00:03:05.000> if

00:03:05.110 --> 00:03:05.120 
that you can hit confirm it or see if

00:03:05.120 --> 00:03:07.509 
that you can hit confirm it or see if
it's<00:03:05.209> gonna<00:03:05.329> block<00:03:05.659> and<00:03:06.010> do<00:03:07.010> whatever<00:03:07.250> special

00:03:07.509 --> 00:03:07.519 
it's gonna block and do whatever special

00:03:07.519 --> 00:03:09.309 
it's gonna block and do whatever special
move<00:03:07.760> you<00:03:07.849> want<00:03:08.030> right<00:03:08.239> so<00:03:08.420> like<00:03:08.870> watch<00:03:09.049> this

00:03:09.309 --> 00:03:09.319 
move you want right so like watch this

00:03:09.319 --> 00:03:10.809 
move you want right so like watch this
will<00:03:09.470> hit<00:03:09.680> and<00:03:09.829> see<00:03:10.010> how<00:03:10.190> much<00:03:10.310> time<00:03:10.370> I<00:03:10.549> have<00:03:10.790> to

00:03:10.809 --> 00:03:10.819 
will hit and see how much time I have to

00:03:10.819 --> 00:03:14.830 
will hit and see how much time I have to
do<00:03:11.090> rabid<00:03:11.900> edge<00:03:12.019> and<00:03:13.000> it's<00:03:14.000> still<00:03:14.239> combos<00:03:14.659> so

00:03:14.830 --> 00:03:14.840 
do rabid edge and it's still combos so

00:03:14.840 --> 00:03:16.690 
do rabid edge and it's still combos so
you<00:03:14.959> have<00:03:15.170> that<00:03:15.440> whole<00:03:15.650> time<00:03:15.920> to<00:03:16.159> like<00:03:16.340> you

00:03:16.690 --> 00:03:16.700 
you have that whole time to like you

00:03:16.700 --> 00:03:18.490 
you have that whole time to like you
know<00:03:16.819> pick<00:03:17.060> what<00:03:17.180> you're<00:03:17.299> gonna<00:03:17.389> do<00:03:17.599> after<00:03:17.780> so

00:03:18.490 --> 00:03:18.500 
know pick what you're gonna do after so

00:03:18.500 --> 00:03:19.839 
know pick what you're gonna do after so
it's<00:03:18.680> really<00:03:18.859> really<00:03:19.069> good

00:03:19.839 --> 00:03:19.849 
it's really really good

00:03:19.849 --> 00:03:21.220 
it's really really good
and<00:03:20.209> that<00:03:20.329> will<00:03:20.419> make<00:03:20.480> more<00:03:20.660> sense<00:03:20.720> once<00:03:21.169> I

00:03:21.220 --> 00:03:21.230 
and that will make more sense once I

00:03:21.230 --> 00:03:22.420 
and that will make more sense once I
started<00:03:21.440> talking<00:03:21.530> about<00:03:21.739> his<00:03:21.949> special<00:03:22.129> moves

00:03:22.420 --> 00:03:22.430 
started talking about his special moves

00:03:22.430 --> 00:03:24.189 
started talking about his special moves
right<00:03:22.609> so<00:03:22.910> his<00:03:23.150> special<00:03:23.480> moves<00:03:23.629> he<00:03:23.780> has<00:03:23.959> his

00:03:24.189 --> 00:03:24.199 
right so his special moves he has his

00:03:24.199 --> 00:03:25.960 
right so his special moves he has his
rabid<00:03:24.560> edge<00:03:24.680> which<00:03:24.859> is<00:03:24.889> this<00:03:25.099> little<00:03:25.340> slash

00:03:25.960 --> 00:03:25.970 
rabid edge which is this little slash

00:03:25.970 --> 00:03:28.839 
rabid edge which is this little slash
move<00:03:26.209> and<00:03:26.480> it<00:03:26.900> goes<00:03:27.019> more<00:03:27.290> more<00:03:27.849> farther

00:03:28.839 --> 00:03:28.849 
move and it goes more more farther

00:03:28.849 --> 00:03:30.819 
move and it goes more more farther
horizontally<00:03:29.690> depending<00:03:30.319> on<00:03:30.410> which<00:03:30.590> version

00:03:30.819 --> 00:03:30.829 
horizontally depending on which version

00:03:30.829 --> 00:03:32.530 
horizontally depending on which version
you<00:03:31.099> do<00:03:31.220> right<00:03:31.430> so<00:03:31.459> the<00:03:31.790> light<00:03:31.940> punch<00:03:32.150> version

00:03:32.530 --> 00:03:32.540 
you do right so the light punch version

00:03:32.540 --> 00:03:34.420 
you do right so the light punch version
travels<00:03:32.989> a<00:03:33.019> little<00:03:33.290> bit<00:03:33.410> medium<00:03:34.250> punch

00:03:34.420 --> 00:03:34.430 
travels a little bit medium punch

00:03:34.430 --> 00:03:36.129 
travels a little bit medium punch
version<00:03:34.879> travels<00:03:35.359> a<00:03:35.419> little<00:03:35.540> bit<00:03:35.750> more<00:03:35.930> and

00:03:36.129 --> 00:03:36.139 
version travels a little bit more and

00:03:36.139 --> 00:03:37.720 
version travels a little bit more and
the<00:03:36.319> heavy<00:03:36.500> punch<00:03:36.769> version<00:03:37.280> travels<00:03:37.609> really

00:03:37.720 --> 00:03:37.730 
the heavy punch version travels really

00:03:37.730 --> 00:03:41.110 
the heavy punch version travels really
far<00:03:38.120> the<00:03:39.019> the<00:03:40.010> harder<00:03:40.340> versions<00:03:40.669> of<00:03:40.819> the<00:03:40.940> move

00:03:41.110 --> 00:03:41.120 
far the the harder versions of the move

00:03:41.120 --> 00:03:43.240 
far the the harder versions of the move
are<00:03:41.389> less<00:03:41.810> safe<00:03:42.109> the<00:03:42.349> light<00:03:42.500> punch<00:03:42.709> versions<00:03:43.069> -

00:03:43.240 --> 00:03:43.250 
are less safe the light punch versions -

00:03:43.250 --> 00:03:44.979 
are less safe the light punch versions -
one<00:03:43.579> and<00:03:43.819> each<00:03:44.030> version<00:03:44.329> gets<00:03:44.599> progressively

00:03:44.979 --> 00:03:44.989 
one and each version gets progressively

00:03:44.989 --> 00:03:47.409 
one and each version gets progressively
more<00:03:45.530> unsafe<00:03:45.919> where<00:03:46.879> depending<00:03:47.180> on<00:03:47.359> the

00:03:47.409 --> 00:03:47.419 
more unsafe where depending on the

00:03:47.419 --> 00:03:50.920 
more unsafe where depending on the
strength<00:03:47.750> to<00:03:47.840> do<00:03:47.959> you<00:03:48.079> do<00:03:48.230> his<00:03:49.480> his<00:03:50.480> run<00:03:50.720> move

00:03:50.920 --> 00:03:50.930 
strength to do you do his his run move

00:03:50.930 --> 00:03:53.259 
strength to do you do his his run move
is<00:03:51.169> back<00:03:51.739> forward<00:03:52.250> oh<00:03:52.519> the<00:03:52.879> main<00:03:53.030> point<00:03:53.239> for

00:03:53.259 --> 00:03:53.269 
is back forward oh the main point for

00:03:53.269 --> 00:03:55.509 
is back forward oh the main point for
his<00:03:53.510> slash<00:03:53.780> is<00:03:53.959> back<00:03:54.169> forward<00:03:54.530> and<00:03:54.739> punches<00:03:55.340> by

00:03:55.509 --> 00:03:55.519 
his slash is back forward and punches by

00:03:55.519 --> 00:03:56.830 
his slash is back forward and punches by
the<00:03:55.579> way<00:03:55.730> if<00:03:55.849> you<00:03:55.909> guys<00:03:56.000> are<00:03:56.180> wondering<00:03:56.419> the

00:03:56.830 --> 00:03:56.840 
the way if you guys are wondering the

00:03:56.840 --> 00:03:58.899 
the way if you guys are wondering the
input<00:03:57.109> for<00:03:57.290> his<00:03:57.470> run<00:03:57.680> move<00:03:57.919> is<00:03:58.159> back<00:03:58.459> forward

00:04:08.770 --> 00:04:08.780 
opponent just like that the medium punch

00:04:08.780 --> 00:04:11.409 
opponent just like that the medium punch
variations<00:04:09.409> of<00:04:09.680> his<00:04:09.889> run<00:04:10.099> move<00:04:10.310> medium<00:04:11.269> punch

variations of his run move medium punch
or<00:04:11.569> medium<00:04:11.870> kick<00:04:12.019> will<00:04:12.169> do<00:04:12.260> this<00:04:12.349> overhead

00:04:12.670 --> 00:04:12.680 
or medium kick will do this overhead

00:04:12.680 --> 00:04:13.689 
or medium kick will do this overhead
woops

00:04:13.689 --> 00:04:13.699 
woops

00:04:13.699 --> 00:04:15.280 
woops
I<00:04:13.819> was<00:04:14.030> wrong<00:04:14.150> one<00:04:14.329> will<00:04:14.780> do<00:04:14.870> that<00:04:14.989> overhead

00:04:15.280 --> 00:04:15.290 
I was wrong one will do that overhead

00:04:15.290 --> 00:04:17.560 
I was wrong one will do that overhead
you<00:04:15.409> saw<00:04:15.590> there<00:04:15.799> so<00:04:16.519> that's<00:04:16.789> the<00:04:16.880> overhead<00:04:17.329> and

00:04:17.560 --> 00:04:17.570 
you saw there so that's the overhead and

00:04:17.570 --> 00:04:19.750 
you saw there so that's the overhead and
his<00:04:17.870> heavy<00:04:18.169> punch<00:04:18.470> or<00:04:18.829> heavy<00:04:19.220> kick<00:04:19.459> will<00:04:19.639> do

00:04:19.750 --> 00:04:19.760 
his heavy punch or heavy kick will do

00:04:19.760 --> 00:04:22.149 
his heavy punch or heavy kick will do
this<00:04:19.849> little<00:04:20.090> swipe<00:04:20.329> that<00:04:21.200> is<00:04:21.440> the<00:04:21.709> only<00:04:21.859> safe

00:04:22.149 --> 00:04:22.159 
this little swipe that is the only safe

00:04:22.159 --> 00:04:23.649 
this little swipe that is the only safe
one<00:04:22.340> on<00:04:22.490> block<00:04:22.700> because<00:04:23.000> the<00:04:23.150> heavy<00:04:23.419> the

00:04:23.649 --> 00:04:23.659 
one on block because the heavy the

00:04:23.659 --> 00:04:24.850 
one on block because the heavy the
overhead<00:04:24.050> and<00:04:24.200> the<00:04:24.260> low<00:04:24.380> versions<00:04:24.770> are

00:04:24.850 --> 00:04:24.860 
overhead and the low versions are

00:04:24.860 --> 00:04:26.740 
overhead and the low versions are
actually<00:04:25.159> super<00:04:25.340> unsafe<00:04:25.789> so<00:04:26.060> you<00:04:26.120> can<00:04:26.300> get<00:04:26.419> on

00:04:26.740 --> 00:04:26.750 
actually super unsafe so you can get on

00:04:26.750 --> 00:04:28.840 
actually super unsafe so you can get on
for<00:04:26.960> them<00:04:27.080> but<00:04:27.380> if<00:04:27.830> they<00:04:27.950> hit<00:04:28.130> you<00:04:28.190> get<00:04:28.430> a<00:04:28.460> combo

00:04:28.840 --> 00:04:28.850 
for them but if they hit you get a combo

00:04:28.850 --> 00:04:30.670 
for them but if they hit you get a combo
so<00:04:29.420> that's<00:04:29.630> like<00:04:29.810> kind<00:04:30.110> of<00:04:30.170> the<00:04:30.260> trade-off

00:04:30.670 --> 00:04:30.680 
so that's like kind of the trade-off

00:04:30.680 --> 00:04:32.950 
so that's like kind of the trade-off
that<00:04:30.710> you<00:04:31.070> go<00:04:31.250> for<00:04:31.520> so<00:04:32.240> you<00:04:32.300> got<00:04:32.480> a<00:04:32.510> combo<00:04:32.810> on

00:04:32.950 --> 00:04:32.960 
that you go for so you got a combo on

00:04:32.960 --> 00:04:34.540 
that you go for so you got a combo on
hit<00:04:33.170> and<00:04:33.410> on<00:04:33.650> block<00:04:33.920> you'll<00:04:34.190> probably<00:04:34.340> get

00:04:34.540 --> 00:04:34.550 
hit and on block you'll probably get

00:04:34.550 --> 00:04:37.630 
hit and on block you'll probably get
punished<00:04:34.910> for<00:04:35.210> it<00:04:36.250> but<00:04:37.250> that's<00:04:37.340> just<00:04:37.430> one<00:04:37.610> of

00:04:37.630 --> 00:04:37.640 
punished for it but that's just one of

00:04:37.640 --> 00:04:40.000 
punished for it but that's just one of
the<00:04:37.730> risks<00:04:37.970> you<00:04:38.030> take<00:04:38.440> trying<00:04:39.440> to<00:04:39.500> open<00:04:39.710> people

00:04:40.000 --> 00:04:40.010 
the risks you take trying to open people

00:04:40.010 --> 00:04:41.440 
the risks you take trying to open people
up<00:04:40.100> right<00:04:40.280> so<00:04:40.430> that<00:04:40.580> is<00:04:40.730> his<00:04:40.940> Run<00:04:41.120> move<00:04:41.270> his

00:04:41.440 --> 00:04:41.450 
up right so that is his Run move his

00:04:41.450 --> 00:04:44.260 
up right so that is his Run move his
other<00:04:41.600> move<00:04:41.810> is<00:04:41.990> his<00:04:42.170> Eclipse<00:04:43.030> whoops<00:04:44.030> I<00:04:44.120> did

00:04:44.260 --> 00:04:44.270 
other move is his Eclipse whoops I did

00:04:44.270 --> 00:04:46.300 
other move is his Eclipse whoops I did
the<00:04:44.330> shadow<00:04:44.540> Eclipse<00:04:44.780> now<00:04:45.020> it's<00:04:45.350> down<00:04:45.710> up<00:04:46.070> and

00:04:46.300 --> 00:04:46.310 
the shadow Eclipse now it's down up and

00:04:46.310 --> 00:04:50.200 
the shadow Eclipse now it's down up and
punch<00:04:46.970> and<00:04:47.530> it's<00:04:48.530> this<00:04:48.800> anti-air<00:04:49.760> move<00:04:49.970> it

00:04:50.200 --> 00:04:50.210 
punch and it's this anti-air move it

00:04:50.210 --> 00:04:51.730 
punch and it's this anti-air move it
seems<00:04:50.480> to<00:04:50.570> be<00:04:50.660> a<00:04:50.720> really<00:04:50.960> good<00:04:51.080> anti-air<00:04:51.590> I've

00:04:51.730 --> 00:04:51.740 
seems to be a really good anti-air I've

00:04:51.740 --> 00:04:54.220 
seems to be a really good anti-air I've
seen<00:04:51.920> an<00:04:52.010> anti-air<00:04:52.400> almost<00:04:52.700> every<00:04:53.000> jump<00:04:53.300> in<00:04:53.450> so

00:04:54.220 --> 00:04:54.230 
seen an anti-air almost every jump in so

00:04:54.230 --> 00:04:56.110 
seen an anti-air almost every jump in so
it<00:04:54.530> seems<00:04:54.860> to<00:04:54.980> be<00:04:55.040> really<00:04:55.280> good<00:04:55.640> that's<00:04:55.940> all<00:04:56.060> I

00:04:56.110 --> 00:04:56.120 
it seems to be really good that's all I

00:04:56.120 --> 00:04:57.790 
it seems to be really good that's all I
can<00:04:56.180> say<00:04:56.300> about<00:04:56.510> it<00:04:56.750> so<00:04:56.870> far<00:04:57.080> he<00:04:57.320> also<00:04:57.440> has<00:04:57.680> the

00:04:57.790 --> 00:04:57.800 
can say about it so far he also has the

00:04:57.800 --> 00:04:59.380 
can say about it so far he also has the
super<00:04:58.070> out<00:04:58.190> of<00:04:58.280> it<00:04:58.370> his<00:04:58.550> shadow<00:04:58.820> Eclipse<00:04:59.000> like

00:04:59.380 --> 00:04:59.390 
super out of it his shadow Eclipse like

00:04:59.390 --> 00:05:01.480 
super out of it his shadow Eclipse like
that<00:04:59.600> it's<00:05:00.290> also<00:05:00.410> one<00:05:00.620> of<00:05:00.650> his<00:05:00.770> Enders<00:05:01.130> his

00:05:01.480 --> 00:05:01.490 
that it's also one of his Enders his

00:05:01.490 --> 00:05:04.510 
that it's also one of his Enders his
eclipses<00:05:02.240> so<00:05:02.570> really<00:05:03.290> really<00:05:03.410> good<00:05:03.620> move<00:05:03.800> so

00:05:04.510 --> 00:05:04.520 
eclipses so really really good move so

00:05:04.520 --> 00:05:05.980 
eclipses so really really good move so
yeah<00:05:04.669> that's<00:05:04.880> the<00:05:04.970> thing<00:05:05.000> about<00:05:05.150> saberwolf<00:05:05.660> is

00:05:05.980 --> 00:05:05.990 
yeah that's the thing about saberwolf is

00:05:05.990 --> 00:05:08.560 
yeah that's the thing about saberwolf is
that<00:05:06.290> he's<00:05:06.830> really<00:05:07.370> good<00:05:07.730> on<00:05:07.760> mix<00:05:08.300> ups<00:05:08.510> because

00:05:08.560 --> 00:05:08.570 
that he's really good on mix ups because

00:05:08.570 --> 00:05:10.300 
that he's really good on mix ups because
you<00:05:08.780> saw<00:05:09.169> that<00:05:09.380> you<00:05:09.590> know<00:05:09.620> he<00:05:09.800> has<00:05:09.890> that<00:05:09.919> dash

00:05:10.300 --> 00:05:10.310 
you saw that you know he has that dash

00:05:10.310 --> 00:05:12.430 
you saw that you know he has that dash
through<00:05:10.610> as<00:05:10.820> well<00:05:11.360> as<00:05:11.450> that<00:05:11.600> run<00:05:11.840> move<00:05:12.050> so<00:05:12.320> he

00:05:12.430 --> 00:05:12.440 
through as well as that run move so he

00:05:12.440 --> 00:05:14.050 
through as well as that run move so he
has<00:05:12.530> a<00:05:12.590> really<00:05:12.830> easy<00:05:13.010> way<00:05:13.370> to<00:05:13.430> mix<00:05:13.760> up<00:05:13.880> your

00:05:14.050 --> 00:05:14.060 
has a really easy way to mix up your

00:05:14.060 --> 00:05:16.510 
has a really easy way to mix up your
opponent<00:05:14.510> he<00:05:15.290> also<00:05:15.470> has<00:05:15.830> you<00:05:16.160> know<00:05:16.250> he<00:05:16.400> can

00:05:16.510 --> 00:05:16.520 
opponent he also has you know he can

00:05:16.520 --> 00:05:17.710 
opponent he also has you know he can
also<00:05:16.640> just<00:05:16.880> throw<00:05:17.060> or<00:05:17.210> something<00:05:17.419> like<00:05:17.540> that

00:05:17.710 --> 00:05:17.720 
also just throw or something like that

00:05:17.720 --> 00:05:20.170 
also just throw or something like that
and<00:05:17.960> then<00:05:18.110> like<00:05:18.950> you<00:05:19.370> know<00:05:19.400> dash<00:05:19.820> through<00:05:20.060> and

00:05:20.170 --> 00:05:20.180 
and then like you know dash through and

00:05:20.180 --> 00:05:22.480 
and then like you know dash through and
do<00:05:20.270> that<00:05:20.300> his<00:05:21.020> back<00:05:21.290> heavy<00:05:21.560> punch<00:05:21.860> also<00:05:22.100> sets

00:05:22.480 --> 00:05:22.490 
do that his back heavy punch also sets

00:05:22.490 --> 00:05:24.310 
do that his back heavy punch also sets
up<00:05:22.669> all<00:05:22.850> kinds<00:05:23.150> of<00:05:23.210> stuff<00:05:23.450> since<00:05:23.750> I<00:05:23.930> mentioned

00:05:24.310 --> 00:05:24.320 
up all kinds of stuff since I mentioned

00:05:24.320 --> 00:05:25.630 
up all kinds of stuff since I mentioned
that<00:05:24.380> you<00:05:24.440> can<00:05:24.650> hit<00:05:24.800> confirm<00:05:25.100> super<00:05:25.490> late

00:05:25.630 --> 00:05:25.640 
that you can hit confirm super late

00:05:25.640 --> 00:05:27.880 
that you can hit confirm super late
right<00:05:25.970> so<00:05:26.480> if<00:05:26.630> you<00:05:26.720> see<00:05:26.930> that<00:05:27.080> it<00:05:27.169> hits<00:05:27.350> you<00:05:27.710> can

00:05:27.880 --> 00:05:27.890 
right so if you see that it hits you can

00:05:27.890 --> 00:05:31.060 
right so if you see that it hits you can
do<00:05:28.040> your<00:05:28.520> you<00:05:29.290> know<00:05:30.290> rapid<00:05:30.650> edge<00:05:30.740> and<00:05:30.890> go<00:05:30.950> into

00:05:31.060 --> 00:05:31.070 
do your you know rapid edge and go into

00:05:31.070 --> 00:05:33.310 
do your you know rapid edge and go into
a<00:05:31.130> full<00:05:31.340> combo<00:05:31.610> however<00:05:32.419> if<00:05:32.690> you<00:05:32.870> see<00:05:33.050> that<00:05:33.200> I'm

00:05:33.310 --> 00:05:33.320 
a full combo however if you see that I'm

00:05:33.320 --> 00:05:37.960 
a full combo however if you see that I'm
it's<00:05:33.650> on<00:05:33.950> block<00:05:34.330> you<00:05:35.330> can<00:05:36.490> you<00:05:37.490> can<00:05:37.640> go<00:05:37.760> for

00:05:37.960 --> 00:05:37.970 
it's on block you can you can go for

00:05:37.970 --> 00:05:40.030 
it's on block you can you can go for
like<00:05:38.180> yellow<00:05:38.600> or<00:05:38.930> your<00:05:39.200> overhead<00:05:39.530> right<00:05:39.710> so

00:05:40.030 --> 00:05:40.040 
like yellow or your overhead right so

00:05:40.040 --> 00:05:41.710 
like yellow or your overhead right so
you<00:05:40.130> can<00:05:40.430> just<00:05:40.580> you<00:05:40.820> can<00:05:40.970> do<00:05:41.060> back<00:05:41.300> forward

00:05:41.710 --> 00:05:41.720 
you can just you can do back forward

00:05:41.720 --> 00:05:44.080 
you can just you can do back forward
after<00:05:42.260> you<00:05:42.380> do<00:05:42.500> this<00:05:42.620> move<00:05:42.860> and<00:05:43.280> if<00:05:43.820> it's<00:05:43.940> on<00:05:44.030> a

00:05:44.080 --> 00:05:44.090 
after you do this move and if it's on a

00:05:44.090 --> 00:05:46.120 
after you do this move and if it's on a
hit<00:05:44.270> you<00:05:44.450> can<00:05:44.570> hit<00:05:44.630> punch<00:05:45.050> and<00:05:45.380> if<00:05:45.800> it's<00:05:45.979> on

00:05:46.120 --> 00:05:46.130 
hit you can hit punch and if it's on

00:05:46.130 --> 00:05:48.280 
hit you can hit punch and if it's on
block<00:05:46.580> you<00:05:46.760> can<00:05:46.910> do<00:05:47.000> kick<00:05:47.240> so<00:05:47.810> you<00:05:47.870> can<00:05:48.050> choose

00:05:48.280 --> 00:05:48.290 
block you can do kick so you can choose

00:05:48.290 --> 00:05:49.780 
block you can do kick so you can choose
which<00:05:48.560> one<00:05:48.740> you<00:05:48.860> want<00:05:49.010> to<00:05:49.100> do<00:05:49.220> and<00:05:49.460> go<00:05:49.580> for<00:05:49.729> the

00:05:49.780 --> 00:05:49.790 
which one you want to do and go for the

00:05:49.790 --> 00:05:51.520 
which one you want to do and go for the
mix-up<00:05:50.060> off<00:05:50.240> of<00:05:50.390> it<00:05:50.510> so<00:05:50.690> it's<00:05:51.169> a<00:05:51.229> really<00:05:51.410> really

00:05:51.520 --> 00:05:51.530 
mix-up off of it so it's a really really

00:05:51.530 --> 00:05:53.500 
mix-up off of it so it's a really really
cool<00:05:51.650> situation<00:05:51.979> for<00:05:52.520> him<00:05:52.640> and<00:05:52.850> that's<00:05:53.390> why

00:05:53.500 --> 00:05:53.510 
cool situation for him and that's why

00:05:53.510 --> 00:05:55.120 
cool situation for him and that's why
back<00:05:53.780> heavy<00:05:54.020> is<00:05:54.169> one<00:05:54.320> of<00:05:54.380> his<00:05:54.530> best<00:05:54.710> normals

00:05:55.120 --> 00:05:55.130 
back heavy is one of his best normals

00:05:55.130 --> 00:05:57.310 
back heavy is one of his best normals
and<00:05:56.030> moves<00:05:56.240> them<00:05:56.360> forward<00:05:56.419> all<00:05:56.720> that<00:05:56.900> much<00:05:57.050> and

00:05:57.310 --> 00:05:57.320 
and moves them forward all that much and

00:05:57.320 --> 00:05:58.600 
and moves them forward all that much and
it<00:05:57.410> lets<00:05:57.590> you<00:05:57.680> hit<00:05:57.860> confirm<00:05:58.100> also<00:05:58.430> into

00:05:58.600 --> 00:05:58.610 
it lets you hit confirm also into

00:05:58.610 --> 00:06:00.280 
it lets you hit confirm also into
whatever<00:05:58.760> you<00:05:58.940> want<00:05:59.090> to<00:05:59.150> do<00:05:59.300> okay<00:05:59.870> so<00:06:00.020> let's

00:06:00.280 --> 00:06:00.290 
whatever you want to do okay so let's

00:06:00.290 --> 00:06:02.440 
whatever you want to do okay so let's
talk<00:06:00.410> about<00:06:00.650> his<00:06:00.800> shadows<00:06:01.610> or<00:06:01.880> his<00:06:02.030> supers<00:06:02.360> or

00:06:02.440 --> 00:06:02.450 
talk about his shadows or his supers or

00:06:02.450 --> 00:06:04.360 
talk about his shadows or his supers or
whatever<00:06:02.660> you<00:06:02.750> want<00:06:02.870> to<00:06:02.930> call<00:06:03.080> them<00:06:03.310> let<00:06:04.310> me

00:06:04.360 --> 00:06:04.370 
whatever you want to call them let me

00:06:04.370 --> 00:06:05.740 
whatever you want to call them let me
just<00:06:04.550> look<00:06:04.669> it<00:06:04.820> let<00:06:04.940> me<00:06:05.030> make<00:06:05.210> sure<00:06:05.240> I<00:06:05.360> know<00:06:05.479> all

00:06:05.740 --> 00:06:05.750 
just look it let me make sure I know all

00:06:05.750 --> 00:06:09.210 
just look it let me make sure I know all
of<00:06:05.780> them<00:06:05.930> I'm<00:06:06.320> pretty<00:06:06.590> sure<00:06:06.740> I<00:06:06.770> do

00:06:09.210 --> 00:06:09.220 

00:06:09.220 --> 00:06:14.740 

shadow<00:06:10.220> okay<00:06:10.550> yeah<00:06:12.040> cool<00:06:13.040> okay<00:06:13.310> so<00:06:13.910> his<00:06:14.479> kick

00:06:14.740 --> 00:06:14.750 
shadow okay yeah cool okay so his kick

00:06:14.750 --> 00:06:17.170 
shadow okay yeah cool okay so his kick
one<00:06:14.930> this<00:06:15.140> one<00:06:15.350> is<00:06:15.500> actually<00:06:16.190> projectile<00:06:16.940> and

00:06:17.170 --> 00:06:17.180 
one this one is actually projectile and

00:06:17.180 --> 00:06:18.700 
one this one is actually projectile and
vulnerable<00:06:17.600> and<00:06:17.810> I'm<00:06:17.930> pretty<00:06:18.169> sure<00:06:18.440> it's<00:06:18.590> an

00:06:18.700 --> 00:06:18.710 
vulnerable and I'm pretty sure it's an

00:06:18.710 --> 00:06:21.400 
vulnerable and I'm pretty sure it's an
overhead<00:06:19.010> as<00:06:19.130> well<00:06:19.419> so<00:06:20.419> yeah<00:06:20.630> this<00:06:20.900> this<00:06:21.169> move

00:06:21.400 --> 00:06:21.410 
overhead as well so yeah this this move

00:06:21.410 --> 00:06:25.480 
overhead as well so yeah this this move
is<00:06:21.680> a<00:06:23.620> projectile<00:06:24.620> and<00:06:24.800> vulnerable<00:06:25.070> thing<00:06:25.310> so

00:06:25.480 --> 00:06:25.490 
is a projectile and vulnerable thing so

00:06:25.490 --> 00:06:26.800 
is a projectile and vulnerable thing so
if<00:06:25.700> you<00:06:26.060> know<00:06:26.150> you're<00:06:26.300> getting<00:06:26.479> zoned<00:06:26.690> out

00:06:26.800 --> 00:06:26.810 
if you know you're getting zoned out

00:06:26.810 --> 00:06:28.180 
if you know you're getting zoned out
then<00:06:27.290> you<00:06:27.470> can<00:06:27.590> use<00:06:27.770> it<00:06:27.800> to<00:06:27.979> go<00:06:28.070> through

00:06:28.180 --> 00:06:28.190 
then you can use it to go through

00:06:28.190 --> 00:06:32.440 
then you can use it to go through
projectiles<00:06:28.729> and<00:06:28.960> it<00:06:29.960> seems<00:06:30.140> pretty<00:06:30.229> good<00:06:31.450> it

00:06:32.440 --> 00:06:32.450 
projectiles and it seems pretty good it

00:06:32.450 --> 00:06:35.350 
projectiles and it seems pretty good it
seems<00:06:32.690> like<00:06:32.990> a<00:06:33.020> pretty<00:06:33.169> good<00:06:33.290> move<00:06:33.590> his<00:06:34.490> combo

00:06:35.350 --> 00:06:35.360 
seems like a pretty good move his combo

00:06:35.360 --> 00:06:38.610 
seems like a pretty good move his combo
one<00:06:35.630> is<00:06:36.320> his<00:06:36.770> pretty<00:06:37.039> much<00:06:37.190> his<00:06:37.340> rabid<00:06:37.700> edge

00:06:38.610 --> 00:06:38.620 
one is his pretty much his rabid edge

00:06:38.620 --> 00:06:41.070 
one is his pretty much his rabid edge
the<00:06:38.890> his<00:06:39.010> shadow<00:06:39.250> Revit<00:06:39.670> edge<00:06:39.820> and<00:06:40.090> his<00:06:40.510> ender

00:06:41.070 --> 00:06:41.080 
the his shadow Revit edge and his ender

00:06:41.080 --> 00:06:44.010 
the his shadow Revit edge and his ender
or<00:06:41.440> you<00:06:41.950> know<00:06:42.070> just<00:06:42.100> anti<00:06:42.520> r1<00:06:42.820> is<00:06:43.060> he<00:06:43.570> has<00:06:43.690> the

00:06:44.010 --> 00:06:44.020 
or you know just anti r1 is he has the

00:06:44.020 --> 00:06:46.140 
or you know just anti r1 is he has the
Eclipse<00:06:44.740> move<00:06:44.950> right<00:06:45.160> so<00:06:45.670> as<00:06:45.790> you<00:06:45.880> see<00:06:46.030> there

00:06:46.140 --> 00:06:46.150 
Eclipse move right so as you see there

00:06:46.150 --> 00:06:47.490 
Eclipse move right so as you see there
the<00:06:46.330> attack<00:06:46.570> property<00:06:46.990> it<00:06:47.170> says<00:06:47.350> it's

00:06:47.490 --> 00:06:47.500 
the attack property it says it's

00:06:47.500 --> 00:06:50.640 
the attack property it says it's
invincible<00:06:47.830> and<00:06:48.780> yeah<00:06:49.780> you<00:06:49.840> can't<00:06:50.170> jump<00:06:50.380> in<00:06:50.530> on

00:06:50.640 --> 00:06:50.650 
invincible and yeah you can't jump in on

00:06:50.650 --> 00:06:54.240 
invincible and yeah you can't jump in on
that<00:06:50.680> you<00:06:51.310> lose<00:06:51.520> every<00:06:51.940> time<00:06:52.860> it's<00:06:53.860> also<00:06:54.040> the

00:06:54.240 --> 00:06:54.250 
that you lose every time it's also the

00:06:54.250 --> 00:06:55.830 
that you lose every time it's also the
move<00:06:54.400> at<00:06:54.550> the<00:06:54.640> end<00:06:54.790> of<00:06:54.880> his<00:06:55.030> ultra<00:06:55.540> that<00:06:55.750> he

00:06:55.830 --> 00:06:55.840 
move at the end of his ultra that he

00:06:55.840 --> 00:06:59.700 
move at the end of his ultra that he
uses<00:06:56.050> so<00:06:56.500> there's<00:06:56.920> that<00:06:57.130> as<00:06:57.280> well<00:06:57.810> but<00:06:58.810> yeah<00:06:58.960> so

00:06:59.700 --> 00:06:59.710 
uses so there's that as well but yeah so

00:06:59.710 --> 00:07:01.170 
uses so there's that as well but yeah so
those<00:06:59.890> are<00:07:00.010> all<00:07:00.130> of<00:07:00.250> his<00:07:00.370> shadow<00:07:00.610> moves<00:07:00.940> as

00:07:01.170 --> 00:07:01.180 
those are all of his shadow moves as

00:07:01.180 --> 00:07:03.870 
those are all of his shadow moves as
well<00:07:01.240> and<00:07:02.020> the<00:07:02.710> last<00:07:02.920> thing<00:07:03.100> about<00:07:03.130> him<00:07:03.490> is<00:07:03.520> his

00:07:03.870 --> 00:07:03.880 
well and the last thing about him is his

00:07:03.880 --> 00:07:05.850 
well and the last thing about him is his
instinct<00:07:04.510> right<00:07:04.660> so<00:07:04.840> instinct<00:07:05.380> is<00:07:05.500> any

00:07:05.850 --> 00:07:05.860 
instinct right so instinct is any

00:07:05.860 --> 00:07:07.200 
instinct right so instinct is any
character<00:07:06.250> has<00:07:06.430> every<00:07:06.730> character<00:07:06.970> has<00:07:07.090> an

00:07:07.200 --> 00:07:07.210 
character has every character has an

00:07:07.210 --> 00:07:08.490 
character has every character has an
instinct<00:07:07.600> it's<00:07:07.750> when<00:07:07.870> you<00:07:07.960> hit<00:07:08.140> heavy<00:07:08.320> phone

00:07:08.490 --> 00:07:08.500 
instinct it's when you hit heavy phone

00:07:08.500 --> 00:07:10.290 
instinct it's when you hit heavy phone
Chevy<00:07:08.710> kick<00:07:08.950> they<00:07:09.100> glow<00:07:09.250> blue<00:07:09.490> or<00:07:10.090> whatever

00:07:10.290 --> 00:07:10.300 
Chevy kick they glow blue or whatever

00:07:10.300 --> 00:07:12.630 
Chevy kick they glow blue or whatever
that<00:07:10.450> color<00:07:10.660> is<00:07:10.860> I'm<00:07:11.860> pretty<00:07:12.160> sure<00:07:12.340> the<00:07:12.490> only

00:07:12.630 --> 00:07:12.640 
that color is I'm pretty sure the only

00:07:12.640 --> 00:07:14.010 
that color is I'm pretty sure the only
thing<00:07:12.790> Sabre<00:07:13.030> wolves<00:07:13.330> does<00:07:13.510> is<00:07:13.690> give<00:07:13.870> him

00:07:14.010 --> 00:07:14.020 
thing Sabre wolves does is give him

00:07:14.020 --> 00:07:15.450 
thing Sabre wolves does is give him
extra<00:07:14.140> damage<00:07:14.620> a<00:07:14.710> might<00:07:14.860> do<00:07:14.980> an<00:07:15.070> additional

00:07:15.450 --> 00:07:15.460 
extra damage a might do an additional

00:07:15.460 --> 00:07:18.390 
extra damage a might do an additional
property<00:07:15.730> but<00:07:16.630> I'm<00:07:17.200> not<00:07:17.500> entirely<00:07:17.800> sure<00:07:17.980> so

00:07:18.390 --> 00:07:18.400 
property but I'm not entirely sure so

00:07:18.400 --> 00:07:20.159 
property but I'm not entirely sure so
let's<00:07:18.520> see<00:07:18.760> I'll<00:07:19.240> just<00:07:19.419> do<00:07:19.540> this<00:07:19.720> without

00:07:20.159 --> 00:07:20.169 
let's see I'll just do this without

00:07:20.169 --> 00:07:22.320 
let's see I'll just do this without
instinct<00:07:21.010> so<00:07:21.160> that's<00:07:21.310> like<00:07:21.520> what<00:07:21.730> that's<00:07:22.090> 8

00:07:22.320 --> 00:07:22.330 
instinct so that's like what that's 8

00:07:22.330 --> 00:07:23.970 
instinct so that's like what that's 8
percent<00:07:22.690> and<00:07:22.900> I'll<00:07:23.110> turn<00:07:23.290> on<00:07:23.410> instinct<00:07:23.800> and<00:07:23.860> do

00:07:23.970 --> 00:07:23.980 
percent and I'll turn on instinct and do

00:07:23.980 --> 00:07:27.600 
percent and I'll turn on instinct and do
the<00:07:24.070> same<00:07:24.250> thing<00:07:25.140> 9<00:07:26.140> percent<00:07:26.560> so<00:07:26.710> his<00:07:27.160> combos

00:07:27.600 --> 00:07:27.610 
the same thing 9 percent so his combos

00:07:27.610 --> 00:07:29.670 
the same thing 9 percent so his combos
will<00:07:27.850> hit<00:07:28.000> significantly<00:07:28.840> harder<00:07:29.169> when<00:07:29.440> he's

00:07:29.670 --> 00:07:29.680 
will hit significantly harder when he's

00:07:29.680 --> 00:07:32.820 
will hit significantly harder when he's
in<00:07:30.480> instinct<00:07:31.480> mode<00:07:31.660> compared<00:07:32.320> to<00:07:32.470> when<00:07:32.650> he's

00:07:32.820 --> 00:07:32.830 
in instinct mode compared to when he's

00:07:32.830 --> 00:07:38.070 
in instinct mode compared to when he's
not<00:07:33.040> so<00:07:33.850> yeah<00:07:36.330> so<00:07:37.330> that's<00:07:37.450> like<00:07:37.630> an<00:07:37.750> instinct

00:07:38.070 --> 00:07:38.080 
not so yeah so that's like an instinct

00:07:38.080 --> 00:07:39.870 
not so yeah so that's like an instinct
combo<00:07:38.410> that's<00:07:38.560> 70%<00:07:39.010> of<00:07:39.370> something<00:07:39.700> if<00:07:39.790> I

00:07:39.870 --> 00:07:39.880 
combo that's 70% of something if I

00:07:39.880 --> 00:07:41.159 
combo that's 70% of something if I
wasn't<00:07:40.060> an<00:07:40.240> instinct<00:07:40.660> you<00:07:40.690> probably<00:07:40.960> wouldn't

00:07:41.159 --> 00:07:41.169 
wasn't an instinct you probably wouldn't

00:07:41.169 --> 00:07:43.409 
wasn't an instinct you probably wouldn't
have<00:07:41.200> done<00:07:41.290> that<00:07:41.650> much<00:07:41.860> damage<00:07:42.180> yeah<00:07:43.180> that<00:07:43.330> was

00:07:43.409 --> 00:07:43.419 
have done that much damage yeah that was

00:07:43.419 --> 00:07:45.240 
have done that much damage yeah that was
a<00:07:43.450> super<00:07:43.810> easy<00:07:43.990> calm<00:07:44.290> with<00:07:44.410> a<00:07:44.440> break<00:07:44.680> also<00:07:44.919> but

00:07:45.240 --> 00:07:45.250 
a super easy calm with a break also but

00:07:45.250 --> 00:07:46.200 
a super easy calm with a break also but
I<00:07:45.280> just<00:07:45.430> wanted<00:07:45.610> to<00:07:45.700> show<00:07:45.790> you<00:07:45.880> guys<00:07:45.940> how<00:07:46.150> much

00:07:46.200 --> 00:07:46.210 
I just wanted to show you guys how much
