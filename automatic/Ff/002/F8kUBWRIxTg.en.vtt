00:03:21.300 --> 00:03:21.310 
pockets so around back you actually have

00:03:21.310 --> 00:03:24.479 
pockets so around back you actually have
another<00:03:21.669> tablet<00:03:22.120> pocket<00:03:22.829> this<00:03:23.829> pocket<00:03:24.130> hero

00:03:24.479 --> 00:03:24.489 
another tablet pocket this pocket hero

00:03:24.489 --> 00:03:26.400 
another tablet pocket this pocket hero
zips<00:03:24.790> down<00:03:25.030> and<00:03:25.329> you<00:03:25.660> have<00:03:25.750> orange<00:03:26.109> lining

00:03:26.400 --> 00:03:26.410 
zips down and you have orange lining

00:03:26.410 --> 00:03:28.440 
zips down and you have orange lining
which<00:03:26.919> I<00:03:27.069> really<00:03:27.400> like<00:03:27.609> because<00:03:27.910> it<00:03:28.209> makes<00:03:28.359> it

00:03:28.440 --> 00:03:28.450 
which I really like because it makes it

00:03:28.450 --> 00:03:30.240 
which I really like because it makes it
easier<00:03:28.930> to<00:03:29.019> see<00:03:29.230> things<00:03:29.470> in<00:03:29.709> the<00:03:29.739> dark<00:03:30.069> if

00:03:30.240 --> 00:03:30.250 
easier to see things in the dark if

00:03:30.250 --> 00:03:32.099 
easier to see things in the dark if
you've<00:03:30.400> got<00:03:30.609> smaller<00:03:31.000> items<00:03:31.419> in<00:03:31.569> the<00:03:31.660> backpack

00:03:32.099 --> 00:03:32.109 
you've got smaller items in the backpack

00:03:32.109 --> 00:03:34.440 
you've got smaller items in the backpack
so<00:03:32.590> this<00:03:32.919> actually<00:03:33.430> even<00:03:33.639> opens<00:03:34.000> up<00:03:34.150> from<00:03:34.329> both

00:03:34.440 --> 00:03:34.450 
so this actually even opens up from both

00:03:34.450 --> 00:03:34.920 
so this actually even opens up from both
sides

00:03:34.920 --> 00:03:34.930 
sides

00:03:34.930 --> 00:03:36.780 
sides
unlike<00:03:35.500> the<00:03:35.650> front<00:03:35.919> this<00:03:36.040> is<00:03:36.250> a<00:03:36.340> kangaroo

00:03:36.780 --> 00:03:36.790 
unlike the front this is a kangaroo

00:03:36.790 --> 00:03:38.640 
unlike the front this is a kangaroo
pocket<00:03:37.209> so<00:03:37.389> this<00:03:37.540> is<00:03:37.690> not<00:03:37.900> overlapping<00:03:38.379> you

00:03:38.640 --> 00:03:38.650 
pocket so this is not overlapping you

00:03:38.650 --> 00:03:41.640 
pocket so this is not overlapping you
can<00:03:38.829> actually<00:03:39.190> reach<00:03:40.000> through<00:03:40.359> both<00:03:41.049> sides<00:03:41.319> of

00:03:41.640 --> 00:03:41.650 
can actually reach through both sides of

00:03:41.650 --> 00:03:44.339 
can actually reach through both sides of
that<00:03:41.680> pocket<00:03:42.599> but<00:03:43.599> it's<00:03:43.750> great<00:03:43.989> because<00:03:44.019> it

00:03:44.339 --> 00:03:44.349 
that pocket but it's great because it

00:03:44.349 --> 00:03:47.250 
that pocket but it's great because it
gives<00:03:44.379> you<00:03:44.650> access<00:03:45.359> ambidextrous<00:03:46.359> access<00:03:46.810> to

00:03:47.250 --> 00:03:47.260 
gives you access ambidextrous access to

00:03:47.260 --> 00:03:49.289 
gives you access ambidextrous access to
