00:01:19.039 --> 00:01:19.049 
like to go to the side and here's the

00:01:19.049 --> 00:01:20.950 
like to go to the side and here's the
key<00:01:19.229> for<00:01:19.470> getting<00:01:19.710> a<00:01:19.799> natural-looking<00:01:20.220> curl

00:01:20.950 --> 00:01:20.960 
key for getting a natural-looking curl

00:01:20.960 --> 00:01:25.330 
key for getting a natural-looking curl
you<00:01:21.960> want<00:01:22.200> to<00:01:22.409> twist<00:01:22.740> it<00:01:23.070> a<00:01:23.280> few<00:01:23.729> times<00:01:23.790> and

00:01:25.330 --> 00:01:25.340 
you want to twist it a few times and

00:01:25.340 --> 00:01:29.090 
you want to twist it a few times and
then<00:01:26.340> I<00:01:26.880> can<00:01:27.479> duck<00:01:27.630> down<00:01:27.659> here<00:01:28.259> I<00:01:28.439> take<00:01:29.070> a

00:01:29.090 --> 00:01:29.100 
then I can duck down here I take a

00:01:29.100 --> 00:01:31.100 
then I can duck down here I take a
couple<00:01:29.400> my<00:01:29.640> fingers<00:01:30.060> and<00:01:30.240> I<00:01:30.479> wrap<00:01:30.720> my<00:01:30.869> hair

00:01:31.100 --> 00:01:31.110 
couple my fingers and I wrap my hair

00:01:31.110 --> 00:01:34.280 
couple my fingers and I wrap my hair
around<00:01:31.380> and<00:01:32.090> then<00:01:33.090> just<00:01:33.360> keep<00:01:33.540> we<00:01:33.810> wrapping<00:01:34.170> it

00:01:34.280 --> 00:01:34.290 
around and then just keep we wrapping it

00:01:34.290 --> 00:01:36.289 
around and then just keep we wrapping it
down<00:01:34.470> I<00:01:34.740> don't<00:01:35.369> like<00:01:35.520> the<00:01:35.700> ends<00:01:35.880> to<00:01:36.210> be

00:01:36.289 --> 00:01:36.299 
down I don't like the ends to be

00:01:36.299 --> 00:01:38.719 
down I don't like the ends to be
completely<00:01:36.750> tufted<00:01:37.290> I<00:01:37.500> think<00:01:38.130> that<00:01:38.189> gives<00:01:38.490> it

00:01:38.719 --> 00:01:38.729 
completely tufted I think that gives it

00:01:38.729 --> 00:01:41.620 
completely tufted I think that gives it
a<00:01:38.790> little<00:01:38.909> more<00:01:39.150> of<00:01:39.270> a<00:01:39.329> natural<00:01:39.479> curl<00:01:39.979> so<00:01:40.979> then

00:01:41.620 --> 00:01:41.630 
a little more of a natural curl so then

00:01:41.630 --> 00:01:44.510 
a little more of a natural curl so then
once<00:01:42.630> you<00:01:42.810> get<00:01:42.960> it<00:01:43.079> down<00:01:43.110> you<00:01:43.320> like<00:01:44.100> to<00:01:44.220> hold<00:01:44.369> it

00:01:44.510 --> 00:01:44.520 
once you get it down you like to hold it

00:01:44.520 --> 00:01:49.550 
once you get it down you like to hold it
down<00:01:44.640> with<00:01:44.820> one<00:01:44.970> finger<00:01:45.649> grab<00:01:46.649> your<00:01:46.890> pin<00:01:48.560> slide
