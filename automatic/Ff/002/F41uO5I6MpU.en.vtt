00:01:19.760 --> 00:01:19.770 
dollars I don't understand why they

00:01:19.770 --> 00:01:21.680

I<00:03:18.239> mean<00:03:18.480> it's<00:03:18.840> a<00:03:18.989> tiny<00:03:19.350> you<00:03:20.100> don't<00:03:20.250> really<00:03:20.430> see

00:03:20.629 --> 00:03:20.639 
I mean it's a tiny you don't really see

00:03:20.639 --> 00:03:22.550 
I mean it's a tiny you don't really see
much<00:03:20.819> of<00:03:20.880> it<00:03:21.180> there's<00:03:21.420> more<00:03:21.660> under<00:03:22.019> on<00:03:22.440> the

00:03:22.550 --> 00:03:22.560 
much of it there's more under on the

00:03:22.560 --> 00:03:25.400 
much of it there's more under on the
underside<00:03:23.040> but<00:03:23.489> a<00:03:23.639> routine<00:03:24.420> you<00:03:24.989> need<00:03:25.139> to<00:03:25.290> do

00:03:25.400 --> 00:03:25.410 
underside but a routine you need to do

00:03:25.410 --> 00:03:27.559 
underside but a routine you need to do
this<00:03:25.590> to<00:03:26.069> swap<00:03:26.549> out<00:03:26.760> it's<00:03:27.030> a<00:03:27.150> very<00:03:27.359> simple

00:03:27.559 --> 00:03:27.569 
this to swap out it's a very simple

00:03:27.569 --> 00:03:29.120 
this to swap out it's a very simple
micro<00:03:28.049> SD<00:03:28.290> card<00:03:28.500> you<00:03:28.590> could<00:03:28.680> have<00:03:28.799> a<00:03:28.829> dad<00:03:28.950> or

00:03:29.120 --> 00:03:29.130 
micro SD card you could have a dad or

00:03:29.130 --> 00:03:30.740 
micro SD card you could have a dad or
for<00:03:29.310> that<00:03:29.519> sure<00:03:29.910> and<00:03:30.180> you're<00:03:30.450> going<00:03:30.599> to<00:03:30.630> have

00:03:30.740 --> 00:03:30.750 
for that sure and you're going to have

00:03:30.750 --> 00:03:33.379 
for that sure and you're going to have
to<00:03:30.870> unscrew<00:03:31.290> this<00:03:31.470> screw<00:03:31.739> it<00:03:32.609> back<00:03:32.760> on<00:03:32.819> and

00:03:33.379 --> 00:03:33.389 
to unscrew this screw it back on and

00:03:33.389 --> 00:03:34.640 
to unscrew this screw it back on and
then<00:03:33.780> you're<00:03:33.900> not<00:03:33.959> even<00:03:34.019> getting<00:03:34.260> to<00:03:34.560> the

00:03:34.640 --> 00:03:34.650 
then you're not even getting to the

00:03:34.650 --> 00:03:38.150 
then you're not even getting to the
transfer<00:03:35.099> process<00:03:35.870> which<00:03:36.870> is<00:03:37.079> not<00:03:37.680> as<00:03:37.859> easy<00:03:37.980> to

00:03:38.150 --> 00:03:38.160 
transfer process which is not as easy to

00:03:38.160 --> 00:03:40.550 
transfer process which is not as easy to
say<00:03:38.340> like<00:03:38.459> you<00:03:38.549> know<00:03:38.579> like<00:03:38.910> the<00:03:39.030> PS<00:03:39.569> Vita<00:03:39.840> even

00:03:40.550 --> 00:03:40.560 
say like you know like the PS Vita even

00:03:40.560 --> 00:03:43.309 
say like you know like the PS Vita even
allows<00:03:40.910> multiple<00:03:41.910> systems<00:03:42.389> a<00:03:42.540> few<00:03:42.720> systems<00:03:42.930> to

00:03:43.309 --> 00:03:43.319 
allows multiple systems a few systems to

00:03:43.319 --> 00:03:45.710 
allows multiple systems a few systems to
use<00:03:43.530> that<00:03:44.190> ID<00:03:44.400> this<00:03:45.030> you<00:03:45.150> have<00:03:45.239> to<00:03:45.299> transfer

00:03:45.710 --> 00:03:45.720 
use that ID this you have to transfer

00:03:45.720 --> 00:03:47.809 
use that ID this you have to transfer
everything<00:03:45.870> over<00:03:46.290> right<00:03:46.919> to<00:03:47.370> the<00:03:47.489> new<00:03:47.609> system

00:03:47.809 --> 00:03:47.819 
everything over right to the new system

00:03:47.819 --> 00:03:49.879 
everything over right to the new system
so<00:03:48.150> there<00:03:48.269> is<00:03:48.419> a<00:03:48.450> trick<00:03:48.959> and<00:03:49.200> I'll<00:03:49.560> try<00:03:49.769> and

00:03:49.879 --> 00:03:49.889 
so there is a trick and I'll try and

00:03:49.889 --> 00:03:51.740 
so there is a trick and I'll try and
explain<00:03:49.919> this<00:03:50.160> really<00:03:50.639> quick<00:03:50.940> so<00:03:51.209> what<00:03:51.599> we're

00:03:51.740 --> 00:03:51.750 
explain this really quick so what we're

00:03:51.750 --> 00:03:53.539 
explain this really quick so what we're
complaining<00:03:52.109> about<00:03:52.380> is<00:03:52.590> the<00:03:52.709> fact<00:03:53.040> that<00:03:53.160> the

00:03:53.539 --> 00:03:53.549 
complaining about is the fact that the

00:03:53.549 --> 00:03:56.509 
complaining about is the fact that the
old<00:03:53.760> format<00:03:54.690> was<00:03:55.019> an<00:03:55.200> SD<00:03:55.560> card<00:03:55.590> the<00:03:55.980> new<00:03:56.130> format

00:03:56.509 --> 00:03:56.519 
old format was an SD card the new format

00:03:56.519 --> 00:03:58.699 
old format was an SD card the new format
is<00:03:56.639> a<00:03:56.669> micro<00:03:57.120> SD<00:03:57.480> card<00:03:57.750> to<00:03:57.900> get<00:03:58.109> all<00:03:58.410> of<00:03:58.590> your

00:03:58.699 --> 00:03:58.709 
is a micro SD card to get all of your

00:03:58.709 --> 00:04:01.039 
is a micro SD card to get all of your
transferred<00:03:59.400> stuff<00:03:59.790> from<00:04:00.329> one<00:04:00.660> to<00:04:00.900> the<00:04:01.019> other

00:04:01.039 --> 00:04:01.049 
transferred stuff from one to the other

00:04:01.049 --> 00:04:03.349 
transferred stuff from one to the other
if<00:04:01.709> this<00:04:01.950> is<00:04:02.130> something<00:04:02.340> you<00:04:02.609> want<00:04:02.819> to<00:04:02.970> do

00:04:03.349 --> 00:04:03.359 
if this is something you want to do

if this is something you want to do
there's<00:04:04.169> a<00:04:04.290> way<00:04:04.500> to<00:04:04.560> transfer<00:04:05.370> all<00:04:05.609> of<00:04:05.669> your

00:04:05.979 --> 00:04:05.989 
there's a way to transfer all of your

00:04:05.989 --> 00:04:08.930 
there's a way to transfer all of your
regular<00:04:06.989> sized<00:04:07.260> SD<00:04:07.889> card<00:04:08.220> stuff<00:04:08.489> to<00:04:08.760> your

computer

00:04:09.959 --> 00:04:13.309 
computer
from<00:04:10.620> your<00:04:10.829> computer<00:04:11.510> install<00:04:12.510> that<00:04:12.810> onto<00:04:13.290> a

00:04:13.309 --> 00:04:13.319 
from your computer install that onto a

00:04:13.319 --> 00:04:17.930 
from your computer install that onto a
micro<00:04:13.799> SD<00:04:14.310> card<00:04:14.639> then<00:04:15.599> you<00:04:16.440> take<00:04:16.799> the<00:04:17.070> micro<00:04:17.519> SD

00:04:17.930 --> 00:04:17.940 
micro SD card then you take the micro SD

00:04:17.940 --> 00:04:20.680 
micro SD card then you take the micro SD
card<00:04:18.269> put<00:04:18.660> it<00:04:18.810> in<00:04:18.989> a<00:04:19.139> regular<00:04:19.440> SD<00:04:19.919> card<00:04:20.400> adapter

card put it in a regular SD card adapter

00:04:20.690 --> 00:04:24.770 
card put it in a regular SD card adapter
hop<00:04:21.690> it<00:04:21.900> into<00:04:22.380> the<00:04:22.560> old<00:04:22.860> 3ds<00:04:23.550> and<00:04:23.969> then

00:04:24.770 --> 00:04:24.780 
hop it into the old 3ds and then

00:04:24.780 --> 00:04:27.170 
hop it into the old 3ds and then
initiate<00:04:25.230> the<00:04:25.500> transfer<00:04:25.889> process<00:04:26.190> to<00:04:27.030> your

00:04:27.170 --> 00:04:27.180 
initiate the transfer process to your

00:04:27.180 --> 00:04:30.770 
initiate the transfer process to your
new<00:04:27.480> 3d<00:04:27.990> XXL<00:04:28.730> everyone<00:04:29.730> got<00:04:29.970> that<00:04:30.000> and<00:04:30.480> then<00:04:30.510> it

00:04:30.770 --> 00:04:30.780 
new 3d XXL everyone got that and then it

00:04:30.780 --> 00:04:32.420 
new 3d XXL everyone got that and then it
will<00:04:30.900> ask<00:04:31.020> you<00:04:31.139> to<00:04:31.170> swap<00:04:31.500> them<00:04:31.740> towards<00:04:32.340> the

00:04:32.420 --> 00:04:32.430 
will ask you to swap them towards the

00:04:32.430 --> 00:04:35.030 
will ask you to swap them towards the
end<00:04:32.550> of<00:04:32.580> the<00:04:32.700> process<00:04:32.880> it's<00:04:33.570> so<00:04:34.230> bad<00:04:34.530> process

00:04:35.030 --> 00:04:35.040 
end of the process it's so bad process

00:04:35.040 --> 00:04:36.920 
end of the process it's so bad process
feels<00:04:35.220> like<00:04:35.340> minor<00:04:35.639> brain<00:04:35.970> surgery<00:04:36.450> is<00:04:36.600> to

00:04:36.920 --> 00:04:36.930 
feels like minor brain surgery is to

00:04:36.930 --> 00:04:38.960 
feels like minor brain surgery is to
pull<00:04:37.110> that<00:04:37.230> off<00:04:37.410> it's<00:04:37.680> kind<00:04:37.980> of<00:04:38.070> a<00:04:38.190> hot<00:04:38.370> mess<00:04:38.400> in

00:04:38.960 --> 00:04:38.970 
pull that off it's kind of a hot mess in

00:04:38.970 --> 00:04:40.490 
pull that off it's kind of a hot mess in
that<00:04:39.180> regard<00:04:39.540> it's<00:04:39.780> nice<00:04:39.990> that<00:04:40.020> it<00:04:40.230> doesn't

00:04:40.490 --> 00:04:40.500 
that regard it's nice that it doesn't

00:04:40.500 --> 00:04:42.800 
that regard it's nice that it doesn't
use<00:04:40.590> expensive<00:04:40.950> cards<00:04:41.820> like<00:04:41.940> the<00:04:42.030> Vita<00:04:42.210> but

00:04:42.800 --> 00:04:42.810 
use expensive cards like the Vita but

00:04:42.810 --> 00:04:45.470 
use expensive cards like the Vita but
you<00:04:43.320> know<00:04:43.440> microSD<00:04:44.430> are<00:04:44.520> more<00:04:44.760> expensive<00:04:45.090> than

00:04:45.470 --> 00:04:45.480 
you know microSD are more expensive than

00:04:45.480 --> 00:04:46.909 
you know microSD are more expensive than
SD<00:04:45.840> you're<00:04:46.110> right<00:04:46.230> if<00:04:46.320> you<00:04:46.470> get<00:04:46.590> a<00:04:46.620> lot<00:04:46.800> of

00:04:46.909 --> 00:04:46.919 
SD you're right if you get a lot of

00:04:46.919 --> 00:04:47.510 
SD you're right if you get a lot of
storage

00:04:47.510 --> 00:04:47.520 
storage

00:04:47.520 --> 00:04:50.300 
storage
super<00:04:48.210> easy<00:04:48.240> to<00:04:48.510> swap<00:04:48.750> so<00:04:49.380> that's<00:04:49.830> basically

00:04:50.300 --> 00:04:50.310 
super easy to swap so that's basically

00:04:50.310 --> 00:04:52.310 
super easy to swap so that's basically
and<00:04:50.639> finally<00:04:51.210> there's<00:04:51.600> one<00:04:51.660> thing<00:04:52.080> that<00:04:52.200> we

00:04:52.310 --> 00:04:52.320 
and finally there's one thing that we

00:04:52.320 --> 00:04:54.830 
and finally there's one thing that we
were<00:04:52.440> just<00:04:52.620> talking<00:04:52.950> about<00:04:53.270> in<00:04:54.270> terms<00:04:54.540> of<00:04:54.720> like

00:04:54.830 --> 00:04:54.840 
were just talking about in terms of like

00:04:54.840 --> 00:04:57.350 
were just talking about in terms of like
how<00:04:55.020> this<00:04:55.260> is<00:04:55.410> just<00:04:55.620> like<00:04:55.800> a<00:04:55.950> step<00:04:56.400> a<00:04:56.610> half<00:04:56.970> step

00:04:57.350 --> 00:04:57.360 
how this is just like a step a half step

00:04:57.360 --> 00:04:59.840 
how this is just like a step a half step
up<00:04:57.540> upgrade<00:04:58.410> right<00:04:58.590> what<00:04:59.370> were<00:04:59.460> you<00:04:59.550> saying

00:04:59.840 --> 00:04:59.850 
up upgrade right what were you saying

00:04:59.850 --> 00:05:01.640 
up upgrade right what were you saying
yeah<00:05:00.030> well<00:05:00.270> it's<00:05:00.540> like<00:05:00.660> what<00:05:00.900> is<00:05:01.080> this<00:05:01.290> really

00:05:01.640 --> 00:05:01.650 
yeah well it's like what is this really

00:05:01.650 --> 00:05:03.380 
yeah well it's like what is this really
