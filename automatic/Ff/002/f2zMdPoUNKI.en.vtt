00:00:10.160 --> 00:00:10.170 
been released like I think an hour ago

00:00:10.170 --> 00:00:14.780 
been released like I think an hour ago
or<00:00:10.440> so<00:00:11.070> maybe<00:00:11.429> even<00:00:11.580> 30<00:00:11.910> minutes<00:00:13.610> what<00:00:14.610> I<00:00:14.639> have

00:00:14.780 --> 00:00:14.790 
or so maybe even 30 minutes what I have

00:00:14.790 --> 00:00:17.029 
or so maybe even 30 minutes what I have
to<00:00:14.940> say<00:00:15.089> about<00:00:15.269> the<00:00:15.480> Dragon<00:00:15.870> is<00:00:16.020> that<00:00:16.260> it's<00:00:16.859> a

00:00:17.029 --> 00:00:17.039 
to say about the Dragon is that it's a

00:00:17.039 --> 00:00:19.220 
to say about the Dragon is that it's a
bit<00:00:17.220> difficult<00:00:17.550> to<00:00:18.000> breathe<00:00:18.270> because<00:00:18.510> you'll

00:00:19.220 --> 00:00:19.230 
bit difficult to breathe because you'll

00:00:19.230 --> 00:00:22.880 
bit difficult to breathe because you'll
have<00:00:19.980> a<00:00:20.070> chance<00:00:20.369> between<00:00:20.910> this<00:00:21.180> dragon<00:00:21.720> or<00:00:21.990> the

00:00:22.880 --> 00:00:22.890 
have a chance between this dragon or the

00:00:22.890 --> 00:00:25.189 
have a chance between this dragon or the
glacier<00:00:23.400> dragon<00:00:23.970> which<00:00:24.119> has<00:00:24.750> the<00:00:24.990> same

00:00:25.189 --> 00:00:25.199 
glacier dragon which has the same

00:00:25.199 --> 00:00:28.400 
glacier dragon which has the same
breathing<00:00:25.410> time<00:00:25.830> ten<00:00:26.250> hours<00:00:27.140> some<00:00:28.140> players

00:00:28.400 --> 00:00:28.410 
breathing time ten hours some players

00:00:28.410 --> 00:00:31.849 
breathing time ten hours some players
may<00:00:28.710> find<00:00:29.039> that<00:00:29.570> it<00:00:30.570> seems<00:00:30.960> impossible<00:00:31.289> to<00:00:31.590> get

00:00:31.849 --> 00:00:31.859 
may find that it seems impossible to get

00:00:31.859 --> 00:00:33.650 
may find that it seems impossible to get
this<00:00:32.040> dragon<00:00:32.460> until<00:00:32.700> you<00:00:33.030> actually<00:00:33.180> see<00:00:33.510> the

00:00:33.650 --> 00:00:33.660 
this dragon until you actually see the

00:00:33.660 --> 00:00:35.870 
this dragon until you actually see the
egg<00:00:33.930> because<00:00:34.800> when<00:00:34.950> you're<00:00:35.100> breathing<00:00:35.309> for<00:00:35.730> it

00:00:35.870 --> 00:00:35.880 
egg because when you're breathing for it

00:00:35.880 --> 00:00:39.229 
egg because when you're breathing for it
it<00:00:36.059> might<00:00:36.390> be<00:00:36.450> a<00:00:36.660> glacier<00:00:37.200> dragon<00:00:37.710> and<00:00:38.239> it

00:00:39.229 --> 00:00:39.239 
it might be a glacier dragon and it

00:00:39.239 --> 00:00:40.010 
it might be a glacier dragon and it
might<00:00:39.420> not<00:00:39.450> be

00:00:40.010 --> 00:00:40.020 
might not be

00:00:40.020 --> 00:00:43.670 
might not be
I<00:00:40.610> tried<00:00:41.610> this<00:00:41.879> multiple<00:00:42.300> times<00:00:42.360> and<00:00:43.110> I've

00:00:43.670 --> 00:00:43.680 
I tried this multiple times and I've

00:00:43.680 --> 00:00:45.790 
I tried this multiple times and I've
been<00:00:44.129> successful<00:00:44.879> with<00:00:45.059> this<00:00:45.270> combination

00:00:45.790 --> 00:00:45.800 
been successful with this combination

00:00:45.800 --> 00:00:48.770 
been successful with this combination
has<00:00:46.800> been<00:00:47.100> tested<00:00:47.550> and<00:00:47.760> has<00:00:48.030> been<00:00:48.239> confirmed

00:00:48.770 --> 00:00:48.780 
has been tested and has been confirmed

00:00:48.780 --> 00:00:52.700 
has been tested and has been confirmed
so<00:00:49.170> let's<00:00:49.410> start<00:00:49.739> breeding<00:00:50.010> uh<00:00:51.260> to<00:00:52.260> breed<00:00:52.500> this

00:00:52.700 --> 00:00:52.710 
so let's start breeding uh to breed this

00:00:52.710 --> 00:00:55.340 
so let's start breeding uh to breed this
dragon<00:00:53.219> the<00:00:53.430> century<00:00:53.789> dragon<00:00:54.270> I<00:00:54.420> I'm<00:00:54.960> not<00:00:55.140> sure

00:00:55.340 --> 00:00:55.350 
dragon the century dragon I I'm not sure

00:00:55.350 --> 00:00:56.990 
dragon the century dragon I I'm not sure
if<00:00:55.469> it's<00:00:55.590> limited<00:00:55.770> or<00:00:56.129> not<00:00:56.280> that<00:00:56.489> it's<00:00:56.670> a<00:00:56.760> three

00:00:56.990 --> 00:00:57.000 
if it's limited or not that it's a three

00:00:57.000 --> 00:00:58.549 
if it's limited or not that it's a three
element<00:00:57.149> dragon<00:00:57.719> basically<00:00:58.199> has<00:00:58.410> the

00:00:58.549 --> 00:00:58.559 
element dragon basically has the

00:00:58.559 --> 00:01:02.420 
element dragon basically has the
elements<00:00:59.039> of<00:00:59.219> our<00:00:59.460> earth<00:00:59.840> water<00:01:00.840> and<00:01:01.430> lastly

00:01:02.420 --> 00:01:02.430 
elements of our earth water and lastly

00:01:02.430 --> 00:01:09.170 
elements of our earth water and lastly
cold<00:01:05.900> I'm<00:01:06.900> assuming<00:01:07.830> that<00:01:08.040> you<00:01:08.400> can<00:01:08.610> use<00:01:08.850> any

00:01:09.170 --> 00:01:09.180 
cold I'm assuming that you can use any

00:01:09.180 --> 00:01:13.130 
cold I'm assuming that you can use any
combination<00:01:10.610> that<00:01:11.610> adds<00:01:11.670> up<00:01:12.150> to<00:01:12.210> these<00:01:12.900> at

00:01:13.130 --> 00:01:13.140 
combination that adds up to these at

00:01:13.140 --> 00:01:15.200 
combination that adds up to these at
least<00:01:13.409> these<00:01:13.590> three<00:01:13.670> elements<00:01:14.670> to<00:01:14.820> get<00:01:15.000> this

00:01:15.200 --> 00:01:15.210 
least these three elements to get this

00:01:15.210 --> 00:01:18.050 
least these three elements to get this
dragon<00:01:15.689> but<00:01:15.900> I've<00:01:16.110> been<00:01:16.350> successful<00:01:17.070> with<00:01:17.310> the

00:01:18.050 --> 00:01:18.060 
dragon but I've been successful with the

00:01:18.060 --> 00:01:21.980 
dragon but I've been successful with the
earth<00:01:18.270> dragon<00:01:18.900> and<00:01:19.049> the<00:01:19.140> ice<00:01:19.320> dragon<00:01:20.659> so<00:01:21.659> I<00:01:21.689> got

00:01:21.980 --> 00:01:21.990 
earth dragon and the ice dragon so I got

00:01:21.990 --> 00:01:24.260 
earth dragon and the ice dragon so I got
the<00:01:22.080> breeding<00:01:22.380> time<00:01:22.530> ten<00:01:22.860> hours<00:01:23.220> it<00:01:23.430> was<00:01:23.580> it

00:01:24.260 --> 00:01:24.270 
the breeding time ten hours it was it

00:01:24.270 --> 00:01:26.149 
the breeding time ten hours it was it
was<00:01:24.450> all<00:01:24.630> purely<00:01:25.020> by<00:01:25.229> accident<00:01:25.259> actually<00:01:26.130> I

00:01:26.149 --> 00:01:26.159 
was all purely by accident actually I

00:01:26.159 --> 00:01:27.200 
was all purely by accident actually I
thought<00:01:26.369> it<00:01:26.430> was<00:01:26.610> going<00:01:26.759> to<00:01:26.850> be<00:01:26.970> another

00:01:27.200 --> 00:01:27.210 
thought it was going to be another

00:01:27.210 --> 00:01:28.999

00:01:34.460 --> 00:01:34.470 
has been confirmed and has been tested

00:01:34.470 --> 00:01:35.300 
has been confirmed and has been tested
it<00:01:34.920> works

00:01:35.300 --> 00:01:35.310 
it works

00:01:35.310 --> 00:01:37.760

00:01:39.620 --> 00:01:39.630 
get the glacier dragon multiple times

00:01:39.630 --> 00:01:42.100 
get the glacier dragon multiple times
before<00:01:39.930> you<00:01:40.409> actually<00:01:40.560> get<00:01:40.890> this<00:01:41.040> dragon<00:01:41.430> so
