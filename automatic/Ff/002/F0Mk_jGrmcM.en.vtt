about or have been affected by suicide

00:02:35.240 --> 00:02:38.960 
about or have been affected by suicide
in<00:02:36.240> my<00:02:36.300> opinion<00:02:37.110> this<00:02:37.650> is<00:02:37.790> partially<00:02:38.790> the

00:02:38.960 --> 00:02:38.970 
in my opinion this is partially the

00:02:38.970 --> 00:02:41.630 
in my opinion this is partially the
fault<00:02:39.270> of<00:02:39.390> the<00:02:39.570> media<00:02:39.930> I<00:02:40.140> think<00:02:41.100> that<00:02:41.490> the

00:02:41.630 --> 00:02:41.640 
fault of the media I think that the

00:02:41.640 --> 00:02:43.880 
fault of the media I think that the
media<00:02:42.000> tends<00:02:42.300> to<00:02:42.510> focus<00:02:42.960> on<00:02:43.140> the<00:02:43.410> act<00:02:43.590> of

00:02:43.880 --> 00:02:43.890 
media tends to focus on the act of

00:02:43.890 --> 00:02:46.040 
media tends to focus on the act of
suicide<00:02:44.100> itself<00:02:44.700> and<00:02:45.030> its<00:02:45.510> effects<00:02:45.960> on

00:02:46.040 --> 00:02:46.050 
suicide itself and its effects on

presented to the public helped improve

00:04:48.300 --> 00:04:51.800

the<00:04:48.480> situation<00:04:48.690> in<00:04:49.200> Austria<00:04:49.860> I<00:04:50.300> think<00:04:51.300> that

00:04:51.800 --> 00:04:51.810 
the situation in Austria I think that

00:04:51.810 --> 00:04:53.870 
the situation in Austria I think that
Japan's<00:04:52.230> media<00:04:52.650> can<00:04:53.040> make<00:04:53.220> that<00:04:53.520> time<00:04:53.760> to

00:04:53.870 --> 00:04:53.880 
Japan's media can make that time to

00:04:53.880 --> 00:04:57.680 
Japan's media can make that time to
change<00:04:54.150> here<00:04:54.770> however<00:04:55.910> such<00:04:56.910> improvements

00:04:57.680 --> 00:04:57.690 
change here however such improvements

00:04:57.690 --> 00:04:59.630 
change here however such improvements
will<00:04:57.960> not<00:04:58.320> occur<00:04:58.860> overnight

00:04:59.630 --> 00:04:59.640 
will not occur overnight

00:04:59.640 --> 00:05:02.270 
will not occur overnight
so<00:05:00.210> it<00:05:00.450> is<00:05:00.600> important<00:05:01.260> that<00:05:01.590> the<00:05:01.770> Japanese

00:05:02.270 --> 00:05:02.280 
so it is important that the Japanese

00:05:02.280 --> 00:05:05.410 
so it is important that the Japanese
media<00:05:02.550> gets<00:05:03.030> started<00:05:03.420> as<00:05:03.780> soon<00:05:04.170> as<00:05:04.410> possible

00:05:05.410 --> 00:05:05.420 
media gets started as soon as possible

00:05:05.420 --> 00:05:08.690 
media gets started as soon as possible
the<00:05:06.420> popularity<00:05:06.990> of<00:05:07.290> suicide<00:05:08.010> as<00:05:08.220> a<00:05:08.250> solution

00:05:08.690 --> 00:05:08.700 
the popularity of suicide as a solution

the popularity of suicide as a solution
to<00:05:09.000> life's<00:05:09.360> problems<00:05:09.570> is<00:05:10.140> a<00:05:10.470> dangerous<00:05:11.370> trend

00:05:11.660 --> 00:05:11.670
