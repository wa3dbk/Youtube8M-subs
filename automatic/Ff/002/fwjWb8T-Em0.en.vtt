going to want to try to attack their
shield<00:00:21.410> side<00:00:22.000> just<00:00:23.000> as<00:00:23.119> you<00:00:23.210> would<00:00:23.360> against<00:00:24.170> a

00:00:24.280 --> 00:00:24.290 
shield side just as you would against a

00:00:24.290 --> 00:00:26.260 
shield side just as you would against a
same<00:00:24.890> headed<00:00:25.189> fighter<00:00:25.369> attacking<00:00:25.880> the<00:00:26.029> shield

same headed fighter attacking the shield
side<00:00:26.689> is

side is

00:00:28.580 --> 00:00:32.019 
side is
perfectly<00:00:29.330> valid<00:00:29.539> option<00:00:30.080> now<00:00:30.890> you<00:00:31.880> might

00:00:32.019 --> 00:00:32.029 
perfectly valid option now you might

00:00:32.029 --> 00:00:34.270 
perfectly valid option now you might
think<00:00:32.060> though<00:00:32.560> isn't<00:00:33.560> it<00:00:33.770> going<00:00:33.860> to<00:00:33.950> be<00:00:34.010> a<00:00:34.040> lot

00:00:34.270 --> 00:00:34.280 
think though isn't it going to be a lot

00:00:34.280 --> 00:00:38.470 
think though isn't it going to be a lot
harder<00:00:34.550> to<00:00:34.730> hit<00:00:34.880> a<00:00:35.000> shield<00:00:35.270> side<00:00:37.450> because<00:00:38.450> of

00:00:38.470 --> 00:00:38.480 
harder to hit a shield side because of

00:00:38.480 --> 00:00:40.750 
harder to hit a shield side because of
course<00:00:38.780> it's<00:00:39.050> the<00:00:39.230> opposite<00:00:39.770> from<00:00:40.370> your<00:00:40.489> sword

00:00:40.750 --> 00:00:40.760 
course it's the opposite from your sword

00:00:40.760 --> 00:00:42.250 
course it's the opposite from your sword
side<00:00:41.000> unlike<00:00:41.390> against<00:00:41.750> the<00:00:41.840> same<00:00:41.989> handed

00:00:42.250 --> 00:00:42.260 
side unlike against the same handed

00:00:42.260 --> 00:00:44.530 
side unlike against the same handed
fighter<00:00:42.440> it's<00:00:42.680> the<00:00:42.770> same<00:00:42.950> side<00:00:43.190> so<00:00:44.180> you

00:00:44.530 --> 00:00:44.540 
fighter it's the same side so you

00:00:44.540 --> 00:00:45.939 
fighter it's the same side so you
wouldn't<00:00:44.780> need<00:00:44.930> to<00:00:44.989> employ<00:00:45.290> a<00:00:45.379> little<00:00:45.739> bit<00:00:45.860> of

00:00:45.939 --> 00:00:45.949 
wouldn't need to employ a little bit of

00:00:45.949 --> 00:00:48.160 
wouldn't need to employ a little bit of
filler<00:00:46.370> kit<00:00:46.550> and<00:00:46.970> footwork<00:00:47.780> is<00:00:47.870> much<00:00:48.019> more

00:00:48.160 --> 00:00:48.170 
filler kit and footwork is much more

00:00:48.170 --> 00:00:49.600 
filler kit and footwork is much more
important<00:00:48.650> when<00:00:49.070> you're<00:00:49.220> fighting<00:00:49.400> an

opposite hand in fight although really

00:00:51.140 --> 00:00:52.450 
opposite hand in fight although really
you<00:00:51.379> should<00:00:51.590> figure<00:00:51.769> out<00:00:51.920> how<00:00:52.040> to<00:00:52.100> use<00:00:52.250> it<00:00:52.370> in

00:00:52.450 --> 00:00:52.460 
you should figure out how to use it in

00:00:52.460 --> 00:00:55.479 
you should figure out how to use it in
any<00:00:52.640> kind<00:00:52.940> of<00:00:53.000> fight<00:00:53.210> is<00:00:53.930> here<00:00:54.320> rather<00:00:55.309> than

any kind of fight is here rather than

00:00:55.489 --> 00:00:59.500 
any kind of fight is here rather than
just<00:00:55.610> trying<00:00:56.210> to<00:00:56.390> do<00:00:56.480> a<00:00:56.510> straight<00:00:56.840> wrap<00:00:58.510> which

00:00:59.500 --> 00:00:59.510 
just trying to do a straight wrap which

00:00:59.510 --> 00:01:04.450 
just trying to do a straight wrap which
may<00:01:00.050> work<00:01:00.290> but<00:01:00.680> it<00:01:00.860> also<00:01:00.979> exposes<00:01:01.489> me<00:01:03.129> to<00:01:04.129> any

00:01:04.450 --> 00:01:04.460 
may work but it also exposes me to any

00:01:04.460 --> 00:01:06.120 
may work but it also exposes me to any
one<00:01:04.790> of<00:01:04.820> a<00:01:04.909> number<00:01:04.940> of<00:01:05.150> counter<00:01:05.449> attacks

00:01:06.120 --> 00:01:06.130 
one of a number of counter attacks

00:01:06.130 --> 00:01:10.440 
one of a number of counter attacks
you're<00:01:07.130> going<00:01:07.310> to<00:01:07.430> want<00:01:07.610> to<00:01:07.700> step<00:01:08.150> to<00:01:08.530> the<00:01:09.530> side

00:01:10.440 --> 00:01:10.450 
you're going to want to step to the side

00:01:10.450 --> 00:01:13.090 
you're going to want to step to the side
keep<00:01:11.450> your<00:01:11.600> shield<00:01:11.780> between<00:01:12.320> you<00:01:12.770> and<00:01:13.010> your

00:01:13.090 --> 00:01:13.100 
keep your shield between you and your

00:01:13.100 --> 00:01:15.010 
keep your shield between you and your
opponent's<00:01:13.490> weapon<00:01:13.640> and<00:01:14.240> then<00:01:14.570> do<00:01:14.720> the<00:01:14.840> same

00:01:15.010 --> 00:01:15.020 
opponent's weapon and then do the same

00:01:15.020 --> 00:01:19.060 
opponent's weapon and then do the same
wrap<00:01:15.290> that<00:01:15.560> we<00:01:15.799> saw<00:01:15.950> earlier<00:01:17.350> and<00:01:18.350> you'll

00:01:19.060 --> 00:01:19.070 
wrap that we saw earlier and you'll

00:01:19.070 --> 00:01:21.870 
wrap that we saw earlier and you'll
notice<00:01:19.250> how<00:01:20.090> I<00:01:20.119> have<00:01:20.330> my<00:01:20.930> shield

00:01:21.870 --> 00:01:21.880 
notice how I have my shield

00:01:21.880 --> 00:01:26.710 
notice how I have my shield
so<00:01:23.200> my<00:01:24.200> shield<00:01:24.740> is<00:01:24.860> protecting<00:01:25.460> my<00:01:25.909> arm<00:01:26.150> at

00:01:26.710 --> 00:01:26.720 
so my shield is protecting my arm at

00:01:26.720 --> 00:01:29.429 
so my shield is protecting my arm at
least<00:01:26.960> I<00:01:27.260> hope<00:01:27.470> it<00:01:27.619> is<00:01:27.740> maybe<00:01:27.950> I<00:01:28.070> mess<00:01:28.520> up<00:01:28.700> in<00:01:28.909> it

00:01:29.429 --> 00:01:29.439 
least I hope it is maybe I mess up in it

00:01:29.439 --> 00:01:32.170 
least I hope it is maybe I mess up in it
get<00:01:30.439> hit<00:01:30.560> there<00:01:30.770> but<00:01:31.280> in<00:01:31.400> any<00:01:31.490> case<00:01:31.549> protecting

00:01:32.170 --> 00:01:32.180 
get hit there but in any case protecting

00:01:32.180 --> 00:01:35.440 
get hit there but in any case protecting
my<00:01:32.270> body<00:01:32.479> so<00:01:33.230> I<00:01:33.260> may<00:01:33.650> kill<00:01:33.890> him<00:01:34.130> and<00:01:34.370> only<00:01:35.060> and

00:01:35.440 --> 00:01:35.450 
my body so I may kill him and only and

00:01:35.450 --> 00:01:38.440 
my body so I may kill him and only and
only<00:01:36.320> lose<00:01:36.620> my<00:01:36.830> arm<00:01:37.010> which<00:01:37.730> is<00:01:37.760> an<00:01:38.120> acceptable

00:01:38.440 --> 00:01:38.450 
only lose my arm which is an acceptable

00:01:38.450 --> 00:01:43.190 
only lose my arm which is an acceptable
trade-off<00:01:38.870> in<00:01:39.110> many<00:01:39.320> situations

00:01:43.190 --> 00:01:43.200 

00:01:43.200 --> 00:01:48.270 

let's<00:01:43.710> just<00:01:43.799> try<00:01:44.009> that<00:01:44.159> again<00:01:44.549> a<00:01:44.580> few<00:01:44.790> times

00:01:48.270 --> 00:01:48.280 

00:01:48.280 --> 00:01:53.240 

again<00:01:48.940> I<00:01:49.090> lost<00:01:49.270> my<00:01:49.390> arm<00:01:49.510> but<00:01:49.720> I<00:01:49.780> hit

00:01:53.240 --> 00:01:53.250 

00:01:53.250 --> 00:01:57.560 

there<00:01:54.250> I<00:01:54.280> was<00:01:54.729> able<00:01:54.850> to<00:01:54.970> protect<00:01:55.149> myself<00:01:56.310> now

00:01:57.560 --> 00:01:57.570 
there I was able to protect myself now

00:01:57.570 --> 00:01:59.969 
there I was able to protect myself now
when<00:01:58.570> we<00:01:58.990> were<00:01:59.079> fighting<00:01:59.290> a<00:01:59.500> same<00:01:59.710> handed

00:01:59.969 --> 00:01:59.979 
when we were fighting a same handed

00:01:59.979 --> 00:02:02.609 
when we were fighting a same handed
fighter<00:02:00.189> I<00:02:00.460> said<00:02:01.149> that<00:02:01.360> attacking<00:02:02.049> low<00:02:02.380> line

00:02:02.609 --> 00:02:02.619 
fighter I said that attacking low line

00:02:02.619 --> 00:02:04.830 
fighter I said that attacking low line
on<00:02:02.890> the<00:02:02.979> opposite<00:02:03.369> side<00:02:03.640> is<00:02:04.240> not<00:02:04.479> really<00:02:04.720> going

00:02:04.830 --> 00:02:04.840 
on the opposite side is not really going

00:02:04.840 --> 00:02:07.139 
on the opposite side is not really going
to<00:02:04.930> work<00:02:05.140> but<00:02:05.649> now<00:02:05.860> we<00:02:05.920> will<00:02:06.369> because<00:02:06.789> that<00:02:06.820> is

00:02:07.139 --> 00:02:07.149 
to work but now we will because that is

00:02:07.149 --> 00:02:11.850 
to work but now we will because that is
now<00:02:07.500> the<00:02:08.500> front<00:02:08.830> foot<00:02:09.130> his<00:02:09.580> shield<00:02:10.179> leg<00:02:10.739> so<00:02:11.739> in

00:02:11.850 --> 00:02:11.860 
now the front foot his shield leg so in

00:02:11.860 --> 00:02:14.790 
now the front foot his shield leg so in
this<00:02:11.950> case<00:02:12.220> you<00:02:13.060> have<00:02:13.269> I<00:02:13.660> would<00:02:14.349> say<00:02:14.560> one

00:02:14.790 --> 00:02:14.800 
this case you have I would say one

00:02:14.800 --> 00:02:17.550 
this case you have I would say one
reliable<00:02:15.489> option<00:02:15.940> which<00:02:16.360> is<00:02:16.390> similar<00:02:16.900> to<00:02:16.930> the

00:02:17.550 --> 00:02:17.560 
reliable option which is similar to the

00:02:17.560 --> 00:02:21.990 
reliable option which is similar to the
straight<00:02:18.459> leg<00:02:19.000> attack<00:02:19.360> you<00:02:19.569> saw<00:02:19.750> earlier<00:02:21.000> just

00:02:21.990 --> 00:02:22.000 
straight leg attack you saw earlier just

00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:25.740 
straight leg attack you saw earlier just
go<00:02:22.150> right<00:02:22.360> for<00:02:22.480> the<00:02:22.569> leg<00:02:23.730> but<00:02:24.730> don't<00:02:25.600> forget

00:02:25.740 --> 00:02:25.750 
go right for the leg but don't forget

00:02:25.750 --> 00:02:27.840 
go right for the leg but don't forget
his<00:02:26.350> sword<00:02:26.620> side<00:02:26.890> is<00:02:27.040> on<00:02:27.100> the<00:02:27.130> same<00:02:27.400> side<00:02:27.430> as

00:02:27.840 --> 00:02:27.850 
his sword side is on the same side as

00:02:27.850 --> 00:02:30.710 
his sword side is on the same side as
your<00:02:27.970> suicide<00:02:28.510> so<00:02:29.019> if<00:02:29.170> I<00:02:29.290> attack<00:02:29.560> like<00:02:29.739> that

00:02:30.710 --> 00:02:30.720 
your suicide so if I attack like that

00:02:30.720 --> 00:02:33.059 
your suicide so if I attack like that
maybe<00:02:31.720> I<00:02:31.810> take<00:02:32.019> his<00:02:32.170> leg<00:02:32.380> but<00:02:32.590> he<00:02:32.680> kills<00:02:32.890> me

00:02:33.059 --> 00:02:33.069 
maybe I take his leg but he kills me

00:02:33.069 --> 00:02:34.440 
maybe I take his leg but he kills me
where<00:02:33.250> he<00:02:33.310> takes<00:02:33.430> my<00:02:33.640> arm<00:02:33.670> which<00:02:34.060> is<00:02:34.090> probably

00:02:34.440 --> 00:02:34.450 
where he takes my arm which is probably

00:02:34.450 --> 00:02:36.780 
where he takes my arm which is probably
worse<00:02:34.690> then<00:02:35.319> just<00:02:35.799> having<00:02:35.980> nothing<00:02:36.160> happens

00:02:36.780 --> 00:02:36.790 
worse then just having nothing happens

00:02:36.790 --> 00:02:39.059 
worse then just having nothing happens
let<00:02:36.940> go<00:02:37.349> so<00:02:38.349> what<00:02:38.440> you're<00:02:38.530> gonna<00:02:38.620> need<00:02:38.799> to<00:02:38.860> do

00:02:39.059 --> 00:02:39.069 
let go so what you're gonna need to do

00:02:39.069 --> 00:02:42.030 
let go so what you're gonna need to do
is<00:02:39.310> use<00:02:39.910> a<00:02:39.940> shield<00:02:40.360> to<00:02:40.690> protect<00:02:40.840> you<00:02:41.200> it's<00:02:41.950> a

00:02:42.030 --> 00:02:42.040 
is use a shield to protect you it's a

00:02:42.040 --> 00:02:43.890 
is use a shield to protect you it's a
similar<00:02:42.400> principle<00:02:42.580> as<00:02:43.120> the<00:02:43.180> highlight

00:02:43.890 --> 00:02:43.900 
similar principle as the highlight

00:02:43.900 --> 00:02:49.270 
similar principle as the highlight
attack<00:02:45.269> step<00:02:46.269> in<00:02:46.420> with<00:02:46.690> a<00:02:46.780> shield<00:02:47.049> like<00:02:47.319> this

00:02:49.270 --> 00:02:49.280 
attack step in with a shield like this

00:02:49.280 --> 00:02:51.430 
attack step in with a shield like this
and<00:02:49.370> in<00:02:49.940> this<00:02:50.030> case<00:02:50.240> it's<00:02:50.840> actually<00:02:51.230> a<00:02:51.290> much

00:02:51.430 --> 00:02:51.440 
and in this case it's actually a much

00:02:51.440 --> 00:02:53.350 
and in this case it's actually a much
stronger<00:02:51.830> position<00:02:52.220> defensively<00:02:52.640> because

00:02:53.350 --> 00:02:53.360 
stronger position defensively because

00:02:53.360 --> 00:02:55.300 
stronger position defensively because
your<00:02:53.690> whole<00:02:53.840> arm<00:02:54.080> is<00:02:54.260> basically<00:02:54.620> behind<00:02:54.950> your

00:02:55.300 --> 00:02:55.310 
your whole arm is basically behind your

00:02:55.310 --> 00:02:57.670 
your whole arm is basically behind your
shield<00:02:55.700> that<00:02:56.300> is<00:02:56.450> your<00:02:57.200> shield<00:02:57.410> can<00:02:57.650> protect

00:02:57.670 --> 00:02:57.680 
shield that is your shield can protect

00:02:57.680 --> 00:02:59.800 
shield that is your shield can protect
pretty<00:02:58.520> much<00:02:58.670> your<00:02:58.850> whole<00:02:59.000> arm<00:02:59.209> and<00:02:59.450> your<00:02:59.630> body

00:02:59.800 --> 00:02:59.810 
pretty much your whole arm and your body

00:02:59.810 --> 00:03:01.650 
pretty much your whole arm and your body
now<00:02:59.990> of<00:03:00.110> course<00:03:00.260> he<00:03:00.440> may<00:03:00.560> wrap<00:03:00.770> over<00:03:00.950> the<00:03:01.069> top

00:03:01.650 --> 00:03:01.660 
now of course he may wrap over the top

00:03:01.660 --> 00:03:03.790 
now of course he may wrap over the top
but<00:03:02.660> that's<00:03:02.870> just<00:03:03.080> a<00:03:03.170> risk<00:03:03.290> you're<00:03:03.560> going<00:03:03.740> to

00:03:03.790 --> 00:03:03.800 
but that's just a risk you're going to

00:03:03.800 --> 00:03:05.590 
but that's just a risk you're going to
have<00:03:03.890> to<00:03:04.040> take<00:03:04.250> you<00:03:04.850> can<00:03:05.000> probably<00:03:05.180> defend

00:03:05.590 --> 00:03:05.600 
have to take you can probably defend

00:03:05.600 --> 00:03:09.070 
have to take you can probably defend
against<00:03:05.900> it<00:03:07.030> if<00:03:08.030> you<00:03:08.209> can<00:03:08.360> figure<00:03:08.510> out<00:03:08.630> a<00:03:08.900> good

00:03:09.070 --> 00:03:09.080 
against it if you can figure out a good

00:03:09.080 --> 00:03:10.870 
against it if you can figure out a good
position<00:03:09.319> for<00:03:09.500> your<00:03:09.770> shield<00:03:10.040> it's<00:03:10.550> different

00:03:10.870 --> 00:03:10.880 
position for your shield it's different

00:03:10.880 --> 00:03:15.010 
position for your shield it's different
for<00:03:11.060> everyone<00:03:11.950> you<00:03:12.950> can<00:03:13.100> also<00:03:13.310> do<00:03:14.239> that<00:03:14.450> same

00:03:15.010 --> 00:03:15.020 
for everyone you can also do that same

00:03:15.020 --> 00:03:17.170 
for everyone you can also do that same
crossover<00:03:15.770> attack<00:03:16.069> I<00:03:16.100> showed<00:03:16.489> you<00:03:16.700> for

00:03:17.170 --> 00:03:17.180 
crossover attack I showed you for

00:03:17.180 --> 00:03:19.390 
crossover attack I showed you for
attacking<00:03:17.720> a<00:03:17.780> same<00:03:18.050> handed<00:03:18.440> fighters<00:03:18.770> sword

00:03:19.390 --> 00:03:19.400 
attacking a same handed fighters sword

00:03:19.400 --> 00:03:25.630 
attacking a same handed fighters sword
saw<00:03:19.730> like<00:03:20.690> this<00:03:22.630> and<00:03:23.709> you<00:03:24.709> can<00:03:24.860> see<00:03:25.070> you<00:03:25.489> have

00:03:25.630 --> 00:03:25.640 
saw like this and you can see you have

00:03:25.640 --> 00:03:28.410 
saw like this and you can see you have
the<00:03:25.730> same<00:03:25.940> protection<00:03:26.480> that<00:03:27.110> you<00:03:27.140> do<00:03:27.530> with<00:03:27.800> the

00:03:28.410 --> 00:03:28.420 
the same protection that you do with the

00:03:28.420 --> 00:03:31.360 
the same protection that you do with the
straight<00:03:29.420> attack<00:03:29.690> it's<00:03:30.620> just<00:03:30.739> a<00:03:30.830> little<00:03:31.160> a

00:03:31.360 --> 00:03:31.370 
straight attack it's just a little a

00:03:31.370 --> 00:03:36.040 
straight attack it's just a little a
little<00:03:31.880> bit<00:03:32.150> trickier<00:03:32.570> because<00:03:34.840> there's<00:03:35.840> the

00:03:36.040 --> 00:03:36.050 
little bit trickier because there's the

00:03:36.050 --> 00:03:37.270 
little bit trickier because there's the
possibility<00:03:36.350> that<00:03:36.620> he<00:03:36.830> will<00:03:36.950> do<00:03:37.040> a<00:03:37.069> crossover

00:03:37.270 --> 00:03:37.280 
possibility that he will do a crossover

00:03:37.280 --> 00:03:40.360 
possibility that he will do a crossover
attack<00:03:37.730> as<00:03:37.910> well<00:03:38.090> so<00:03:39.019> this<00:03:39.260> is<00:03:39.440> a<00:03:39.470> slightly

00:03:40.360 --> 00:03:40.370 
attack as well so this is a slightly

00:03:40.370 --> 00:03:41.680 
attack as well so this is a slightly
more<00:03:40.610> advanced<00:03:41.030> technique<00:03:41.390> but<00:03:41.569> it's

00:03:41.680 --> 00:03:41.690 
more advanced technique but it's

00:03:41.690 --> 00:03:43.509 
more advanced technique but it's
something<00:03:41.840> that<00:03:41.959> you<00:03:42.080> can<00:03:42.230> still<00:03:42.470> even<00:03:43.430> if

00:03:43.509 --> 00:03:43.519 
something that you can still even if

00:03:43.519 --> 00:03:46.150 
something that you can still even if
you're<00:03:43.640> a<00:03:43.670> beginning<00:03:43.970> fighter<00:03:44.920> so<00:03:45.920> it<00:03:46.069> is

00:03:46.150 --> 00:03:46.160 
you're a beginning fighter so it is

00:03:46.160 --> 00:03:47.680 
you're a beginning fighter so it is
covered<00:03:46.430> by<00:03:46.519> attention<00:03:47.000> there<00:03:47.390> are<00:03:47.510> a<00:03:47.540> few

00:03:47.680 --> 00:03:47.690 
covered by attention there are a few

00:03:47.690 --> 00:03:50.680 
covered by attention there are a few
other<00:03:47.870> things<00:03:47.989> to<00:03:48.950> pay<00:03:49.100> attention<00:03:49.130> to<00:03:49.670> if<00:03:50.239> you

00:03:50.680 --> 00:03:50.690 
other things to pay attention to if you

00:03:50.690 --> 00:03:52.449 
other things to pay attention to if you
were<00:03:50.780> going<00:03:51.019> to<00:03:51.170> attack<00:03:51.620> and<00:03:51.890> opposite<00:03:52.190> handed

00:03:52.449 --> 00:03:52.459 
were going to attack and opposite handed

00:03:52.459 --> 00:03:55.900 
were going to attack and opposite handed
fighters<00:03:52.819> shield<00:03:53.450> play<00:03:53.860> so<00:03:54.860> one<00:03:55.340> of<00:03:55.370> them<00:03:55.640> is

00:03:55.900 --> 00:03:55.910 
fighters shield play so one of them is

00:03:55.910 --> 00:03:59.470 
fighters shield play so one of them is
that<00:03:56.780> he's<00:03:57.500> especially<00:03:57.920> do<00:03:58.430> a<00:03:58.459> crossover<00:03:58.700> he

00:03:59.470 --> 00:03:59.480 
that he's especially do a crossover he

00:03:59.480 --> 00:04:03.070 
that he's especially do a crossover he
can<00:03:59.630> attack<00:03:59.870> your<00:04:00.019> leg<00:04:00.260> like<00:04:00.650> so

00:04:03.070 --> 00:04:03.080 

00:04:03.080 --> 00:04:05.020 

so<00:04:03.920> that's<00:04:04.100> something<00:04:04.280> you<00:04:04.490> have<00:04:04.520> to<00:04:04.730> be<00:04:04.820> wary

00:04:05.020 --> 00:04:05.030 
so that's something you have to be wary

00:04:05.030 --> 00:04:09.160 
so that's something you have to be wary
about<00:04:05.180> if<00:04:05.660> you<00:04:05.840> step<00:04:06.080> out<00:04:06.230> far<00:04:06.500> enough<00:04:07.990> you<00:04:08.990> may

00:04:09.160 --> 00:04:09.170 
about if you step out far enough you may

00:04:09.170 --> 00:04:10.840 
about if you step out far enough you may
warn<00:04:09.590> it<00:04:09.710> off<00:04:09.830> or<00:04:10.190> at<00:04:10.280> least<00:04:10.430> make<00:04:10.610> it<00:04:10.640> a<00:04:10.760> lot

00:04:10.840 --> 00:04:10.850 
warn it off or at least make it a lot

00:04:10.850 --> 00:04:13.720 
warn it off or at least make it a lot
harder<00:04:10.880> for<00:04:11.120> him<00:04:12.280> another<00:04:13.280> thing<00:04:13.490> to<00:04:13.640> consider

00:04:13.720 --> 00:04:13.730 
harder for him another thing to consider

00:04:13.730 --> 00:04:16.150 
harder for him another thing to consider
is<00:04:14.210> of<00:04:14.330> course<00:04:14.540> that<00:04:14.780> as<00:04:14.960> we<00:04:15.590> were<00:04:15.740> showing

00:04:16.150 --> 00:04:16.160 
is of course that as we were showing

00:04:16.160 --> 00:04:18.310 
is of course that as we were showing
earlier<00:04:16.340> if<00:04:16.910> he's<00:04:17.450> balanced<00:04:17.900> well<00:04:18.049> on<00:04:18.200> his

00:04:18.310 --> 00:04:18.320 
earlier if he's balanced well on his

00:04:18.320 --> 00:04:21.430 
earlier if he's balanced well on his
back<00:04:18.560> leg<00:04:18.890> his<00:04:19.220> back<00:04:19.459> foot<00:04:19.790> it's<00:04:20.630> as<00:04:20.930> easy<00:04:21.200> as

00:04:21.430 --> 00:04:21.440 
back leg his back foot it's as easy as

00:04:21.440 --> 00:04:23.830 
back leg his back foot it's as easy as
pie<00:04:21.650> for<00:04:21.980> him<00:04:22.100> to<00:04:22.130> just<00:04:22.970> move<00:04:23.210> his<00:04:23.360> leg<00:04:23.570> out<00:04:23.720> of

00:04:23.830 --> 00:04:23.840 
pie for him to just move his leg out of

00:04:23.840 --> 00:04:25.180 
pie for him to just move his leg out of
the<00:04:23.900> way<00:04:23.990> for<00:04:24.050> him<00:04:24.350> to<00:04:24.380> slip<00:04:24.620> it<00:04:24.770> away<00:04:24.950> from<00:04:25.070> my

00:04:25.180 --> 00:04:25.190 
the way for him to slip it away from my

00:04:25.190 --> 00:04:28.330 
the way for him to slip it away from my
attack<00:04:25.460> and<00:04:26.140> even<00:04:27.140> if<00:04:27.350> I'm<00:04:27.470> not<00:04:27.500> exposed<00:04:27.950> to<00:04:28.100> to

00:04:28.330 --> 00:04:28.340 
attack and even if I'm not exposed to to

00:04:28.340 --> 00:04:29.890 
attack and even if I'm not exposed to to
a<00:04:28.370> counter<00:04:28.700> attack<00:04:28.790> I<00:04:29.180> have<00:04:29.540> not<00:04:29.780> really

00:04:29.890 --> 00:04:29.900 
a counter attack I have not really

00:04:29.900 --> 00:04:33.400 
a counter attack I have not really
accomplished<00:04:30.410> much<00:04:31.660> you<00:04:32.660> know<00:04:32.720> and<00:04:32.900> I<00:04:33.140> do<00:04:33.320> this

00:04:33.400 --> 00:04:33.410 
accomplished much you know and I do this

00:04:33.410 --> 00:04:37.390 
accomplished much you know and I do this
all<00:04:33.560> day<00:04:33.620> and<00:04:35.140> he<00:04:36.140> still<00:04:36.380> has<00:04:36.560> the<00:04:36.710> upper<00:04:36.920> hand

00:04:37.390 --> 00:04:37.400 
all day and he still has the upper hand

00:04:37.400 --> 00:04:39.760 
all day and he still has the upper hand
similarly<00:04:38.120> if<00:04:38.660> I<00:04:38.750> do<00:04:38.810> a<00:04:38.930> crossover<00:04:39.410> and<00:04:39.590> he

00:04:39.760 --> 00:04:39.770 
similarly if I do a crossover and he

00:04:39.770 --> 00:04:42.910 
similarly if I do a crossover and he
slips<00:04:40.010> his<00:04:40.040> leg<00:04:41.170> then<00:04:42.170> I'm<00:04:42.440> gonna<00:04:42.560> have<00:04:42.680> to<00:04:42.770> get

00:04:42.910 --> 00:04:42.920 
slips his leg then I'm gonna have to get

00:04:42.920 --> 00:04:44.800 
slips his leg then I'm gonna have to get
get<00:04:43.190> out<00:04:43.280> of<00:04:43.370> there<00:04:43.460> before<00:04:43.580> he<00:04:43.910> attacks<00:04:44.630> my

00:04:44.800 --> 00:04:44.810 
get out of there before he attacks my

00:04:44.810 --> 00:04:47.920 
get out of there before he attacks my
leg<00:04:45.760> so<00:04:46.760> this<00:04:47.060> is<00:04:47.150> what<00:04:47.300> you<00:04:47.390> have<00:04:47.540> to<00:04:47.630> be<00:04:47.750> aware

00:04:47.920 --> 00:04:47.930 
leg so this is what you have to be aware

00:04:47.930 --> 00:04:50.620 
leg so this is what you have to be aware
of<00:04:47.990> when<00:04:48.710> you're<00:04:48.800> doing<00:04:49.070> an<00:04:49.580> attack<00:04:49.940> on<00:04:50.210> lobs

00:04:50.620 --> 00:04:50.630 
of when you're doing an attack on lobs

00:04:50.630 --> 00:04:54.840 
of when you're doing an attack on lobs
with<00:04:50.780> had<00:04:50.930> fighters<00:04:51.320> shield

00:04:54.840 --> 00:04:54.850 

00:04:54.850 --> 00:04:57.170 

you<00:04:55.850> boy

00:04:57.170 --> 00:04:57.180 
you boy

00:04:57.180 --> 00:05:01.470 
you boy
to<00:04:58.180> the<00:04:58.270> side<00:04:59.190> keep<00:05:00.190> your<00:05:00.340> shield<00:05:00.520> between<00:05:01.030> you

00:05:01.470 --> 00:05:01.480 
to the side keep your shield between you

00:05:01.480 --> 00:05:03.450 
to the side keep your shield between you
and<00:05:01.720> your<00:05:01.870> opponent's<00:05:02.230> weapon<00:05:02.350> and<00:05:03.040> then<00:05:03.280> do

00:05:03.450 --> 00:05:03.460 
and your opponent's weapon and then do

00:05:03.460 --> 00:05:07.970 
and your opponent's weapon and then do
the<00:05:03.550> same<00:05:03.760> wrap<00:05:04.000> that<00:05:04.300> we<00:05:04.540> saw<00:05:04.660> earlier

00:05:07.970 --> 00:05:07.980 

00:05:07.980 --> 00:05:11.600 

stepped<00:05:08.980> in<00:05:09.190> with<00:05:09.340> a<00:05:09.430> shield<00:05:09.730> like<00:05:09.880> this<00:05:10.270> and

00:05:11.600 --> 00:05:11.610 
stepped in with a shield like this and

00:05:11.610 --> 00:05:14.070 
stepped in with a shield like this and
in<00:05:12.610> this<00:05:12.700> case<00:05:12.970> it's<00:05:13.510> actually<00:05:13.720> a<00:05:13.960> much

00:05:14.070 --> 00:05:14.080 
in this case it's actually a much

00:05:14.080 --> 00:05:16.200 
in this case it's actually a much
stronger<00:05:14.530> position<00:05:14.890> defensively<00:05:15.310> because

00:05:16.200 --> 00:05:16.210 
stronger position defensively because

00:05:16.210 --> 00:05:18.060 
stronger position defensively because
your<00:05:16.360> whole<00:05:16.510> arms<00:05:16.900> basically<00:05:17.290> behind<00:05:17.650> his

00:05:18.060 --> 00:05:18.070 
your whole arms basically behind his

00:05:18.070 --> 00:05:20.040 
your whole arms basically behind his
shield<00:05:18.370> he's<00:05:18.940> balanced<00:05:19.390> well<00:05:19.540> on<00:05:19.690> his<00:05:19.780> back

00:05:20.040 --> 00:05:20.050 
shield he's balanced well on his back

00:05:20.050 --> 00:05:23.130 
shield he's balanced well on his back
leg<00:05:20.380> his<00:05:20.740> back<00:05:20.950> foot<00:05:21.250> it's<00:05:22.120> as<00:05:22.450> easy<00:05:22.690> as<00:05:22.930> pie

00:05:23.130 --> 00:05:23.140 
leg his back foot it's as easy as pie

00:05:23.140 --> 00:05:25.380 
leg his back foot it's as easy as pie
for<00:05:23.470> him<00:05:23.620> to<00:05:23.890> just<00:05:24.490> move<00:05:24.700> his<00:05:24.850> leg<00:05:25.060> out<00:05:25.240> of<00:05:25.330> the

00:05:25.380 --> 00:05:25.390 
for him to just move his leg out of the

00:05:25.390 --> 00:05:26.700 
for him to just move his leg out of the
way<00:05:25.480> for<00:05:25.540> him<00:05:25.870> to<00:05:25.900> slip<00:05:26.140> it<00:05:26.260> away<00:05:26.470> from<00:05:26.620> my

00:05:26.700 --> 00:05:26.710 
way for him to slip it away from my

00:05:26.710 --> 00:05:29.850 
way for him to slip it away from my
attack<00:05:26.980> and<00:05:27.630> even<00:05:28.630> if<00:05:28.840> I'm<00:05:28.960> not<00:05:28.990> exposed<00:05:29.440> to<00:05:29.650> to

00:05:29.850 --> 00:05:29.860 
attack and even if I'm not exposed to to

00:05:29.860 --> 00:05:31.380 
attack and even if I'm not exposed to to
a<00:05:29.890> counter-attack<00:05:30.280> I<00:05:30.640> have<00:05:31.030> not<00:05:31.270> really

00:05:31.380 --> 00:05:31.390 
a counter-attack I have not really

00:05:31.390 --> 00:05:35.940 
a counter-attack I have not really
accomplished<00:05:31.900> much<00:05:33.450> you<00:05:34.450> can<00:05:34.600> also<00:05:34.810> do<00:05:35.740> that

00:05:35.940 --> 00:05:35.950 
accomplished much you can also do that

00:05:35.950 --> 00:05:38.190 
accomplished much you can also do that
same<00:05:36.520> crossover<00:05:37.270> attack<00:05:37.570> I<00:05:37.600> showed<00:05:37.990> you

00:05:38.190 --> 00:05:38.200 
same crossover attack I showed you

00:05:38.200 --> 00:05:40.260 
same crossover attack I showed you
before<00:05:38.590> attacking<00:05:39.040> a<00:05:39.280> same<00:05:39.550> handed<00:05:39.940> fighters

00:05:40.260 --> 00:05:40.270 
before attacking a same handed fighters

00:05:40.270 --> 00:05:44.830 
before attacking a same handed fighters
sword<00:05:40.900> saw<00:05:41.230> like<00:05:42.220> this

00:05:44.830 --> 00:05:44.840 

00:05:44.840 --> 00:05:47.170 

especially<00:05:45.740> if<00:05:45.800> you<00:05:45.860> do<00:05:45.950> a<00:05:45.980> crossover<00:05:46.400> he<00:05:47.030> can

00:05:47.170 --> 00:05:47.180 
especially if you do a crossover he can

00:05:47.180 --> 00:05:52.060 
especially if you do a crossover he can
attack<00:05:47.389> your<00:05:47.570> leg<00:05:47.810> like<00:05:48.169> so<00:05:50.530> if<00:05:51.530> you<00:05:51.650> step<00:05:51.919> out

00:05:52.060 --> 00:05:52.070 
attack your leg like so if you step out

00:05:52.070 --> 00:05:56.110 
attack your leg like so if you step out
far<00:05:52.340> enough<00:05:53.830> you<00:05:54.830> may<00:05:55.010> burn<00:05:55.370> it<00:05:55.550> off<00:05:55.669> or<00:05:56.030> at

00:05:56.110 --> 00:05:56.120 
far enough you may burn it off or at

00:05:56.120 --> 00:06:06.310 
far enough you may burn it off or at
least<00:05:56.270> make<00:05:56.450> it<00:05:56.480> a<00:05:56.600> lot<00:05:56.690> harder<00:05:56.840> for<00:05:56.960> him

00:06:06.310 --> 00:06:06.320 

00:06:06.320 --> 00:06:08.380
