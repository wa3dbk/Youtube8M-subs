00:02:25.830 --> 00:02:25.840 
invisible part closure you'll start

00:02:25.840 --> 00:02:27.750 
invisible part closure you'll start
laying<00:02:26.080> in<00:02:26.290> that<00:02:26.320> same<00:02:26.770> like<00:02:27.250> using<00:02:27.490> that<00:02:27.580> same

00:02:49.950 --> 00:02:49.960 
that point you stop at that point you do

00:02:49.960 --> 00:02:51.480 
that point you stop at that point you do
the<00:02:50.080> other<00:02:50.200> side<00:02:50.320> seems<00:02:50.590> like<00:02:50.710> wait<00:02:50.890> go<00:02:51.250> all

00:02:51.480 --> 00:02:51.490 
the other side seems like wait go all

00:02:51.490 --> 00:02:53.940 
the other side seems like wait go all
the<00:02:51.850> way<00:02:51.880> all<00:02:52.180> the<00:02:52.240> way<00:02:52.480> all<00:02:52.570> the<00:02:52.780> way<00:02:52.840> stop<00:02:53.590> so

00:02:53.940 --> 00:02:53.950 
the way all the way all the way stop so

00:02:53.950 --> 00:02:55.470 
the way all the way all the way stop so
you<00:02:54.040> at<00:02:54.130> that<00:02:54.220> point<00:02:54.460> that<00:02:54.880> way<00:02:55.060> this<00:02:55.240> part

00:02:55.470 --> 00:02:55.480 
you at that point that way this part

00:02:55.480 --> 00:02:57.630 
you at that point that way this part
remains<00:02:55.780> flat<00:02:56.110> and<00:02:56.530> then<00:02:57.100> that<00:02:57.310> way<00:02:57.460> your

00:02:57.630 --> 00:02:57.640 
remains flat and then that way your

00:02:57.640 --> 00:02:59.880 
remains flat and then that way your
closure<00:02:57.910> like<00:02:58.510> the<00:02:58.690> visual<00:02:58.990> part<00:02:59.170> section<00:02:59.800> is

00:02:59.880 --> 00:02:59.890 
closure like the visual part section is

00:02:59.890 --> 00:03:03.530 
closure like the visual part section is
just<00:03:00.070> very<00:03:00.280> very<00:03:00.370> neat<00:03:00.700> what<00:03:01.390> turn<00:03:01.540> us<00:03:01.660> around

00:03:03.530 --> 00:03:03.540 
just very very neat what turn us around

00:03:03.540 --> 00:03:09.210

00:03:13.050 --> 00:03:13.060 
lay this way at that point and only at

00:03:13.060 --> 00:03:15.900 
lay this way at that point and only at
that<00:03:13.210> point<00:03:13.510> will<00:03:13.840> you<00:03:13.990> cut<00:03:14.820> so<00:03:15.820> I'm

once you fold the tracks under you will
be<00:04:47.180> getting<00:04:47.360> the<00:04:47.660> straight<00:04:48.110> edges<00:04:48.320> I<00:04:48.530> was

00:04:48.670 --> 00:04:48.680 
be getting the straight edges I was

00:04:48.680 --> 00:04:52.240 
be getting the straight edges I was
talking<00:04:48.950> about<00:04:48.980> at<00:04:49.160> first<00:04:49.190> and<00:04:50.710> you<00:04:51.710> will<00:04:51.860> I

talking about at first and you will I
actually<00:04:52.760> attach<00:04:53.120> the<00:04:53.330> combs<00:04:53.540> right<00:04:53.900> here

00:04:54.040 --> 00:04:54.050 
actually attach the combs right here

00:04:54.050 --> 00:04:56.020 
actually attach the combs right here
already<00:04:54.290> but<00:04:55.070> I'll<00:04:55.280> show<00:04:55.490> a<00:04:55.520> picture<00:04:55.790> of<00:04:55.940> what

00:05:40.990 --> 00:05:41.000 
closely this is exactly high so the so

00:05:41.000 --> 00:05:42.630 
closely this is exactly high so the so
the<00:05:41.030> wefts<00:05:41.360> going<00:05:41.720> straight<00:05:41.930> up<00:05:41.960> and<00:05:42.200> down

00:05:42.630 --> 00:05:42.640 
the wefts going straight up and down

00:05:42.640 --> 00:05:45.130 
the wefts going straight up and down
when<00:05:43.640> others<00:05:43.820> were<00:05:43.850> part<00:05:44.120> method<00:05:44.480> and<00:05:44.660> I

00:05:45.130 --> 00:05:45.140 
when others were part method and I

00:05:45.140 --> 00:05:46.630 
when others were part method and I
thought<00:05:45.350> so<00:05:45.410> after<00:05:45.920> I<00:05:46.130> saw<00:05:46.310> them<00:05:46.430> straight<00:05:46.580> up

00:05:46.630 --> 00:05:46.640 
thought so after I saw them straight up

00:05:46.640 --> 00:05:47.920 
thought so after I saw them straight up
and<00:05:46.760> down<00:05:46.790> like<00:05:47.150> I<00:05:47.270> said<00:05:47.330> I<00:05:47.450> folded<00:05:47.810> it

00:05:47.920 --> 00:05:47.930 
and down like I said I folded it

00:05:47.930 --> 00:05:51.280 
and down like I said I folded it
directly<00:05:48.260> underneath<00:05:49.630> the<00:05:50.630> visible<00:05:50.900> part<00:05:51.050> to

00:05:51.280 --> 00:05:51.290 
directly underneath the visible part to

00:05:51.290 --> 00:05:52.570

00:05:52.570 --> 00:05:52.580 
make sure i have that straight edge and

00:05:52.580 --> 00:05:55.720
