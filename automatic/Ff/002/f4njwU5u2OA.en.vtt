the<00:00:00.329> idea<00:00:00.719> of<00:00:00.810> directional<00:00:01.589> intent<00:00:02.010> goes<00:00:02.639> as

00:00:02.810 --> 00:00:02.820 
the idea of directional intent goes as

00:00:02.820 --> 00:00:05.539 
the idea of directional intent goes as
follows<00:00:03.230> if<00:00:04.230> we<00:00:04.470> are<00:00:04.589> to<00:00:04.770> understand<00:00:05.250> the

00:00:05.539 --> 00:00:05.549 
follows if we are to understand the

00:00:05.549 --> 00:00:08.930 
follows if we are to understand the
strings<00:00:05.940> as<00:00:06.299> a<00:00:06.359> horizontal<00:00:07.170> plane<00:00:07.610> then<00:00:08.610> the

00:00:08.930 --> 00:00:08.940 
strings as a horizontal plane then the

00:00:08.940 --> 00:00:11.240 
strings as a horizontal plane then the

means<00:00:12.509> that<00:00:12.990> the<00:00:13.170> plane<00:00:13.440> finger<00:00:13.980> will<00:00:14.700> reach

00:00:15.049 --> 00:00:15.059 
means that the plane finger will reach

00:00:15.059 --> 00:00:19.160 
means that the plane finger will reach
the<00:00:15.839> bad<00:00:16.289> part<00:00:16.740> of<00:00:16.980> its<00:00:17.310> trajectory<00:00:18.109> at<00:00:19.109> a

00:00:19.160 --> 00:00:19.170 
the bad part of its trajectory at a

to the horizontal plane I will say that

00:00:26.789 --> 00:00:28.810 
to the horizontal plane I will say that
again<00:00:27.090> and<00:00:27.330> I<00:00:27.570> will<00:00:27.720> play<00:00:27.960> it<00:00:27.990> to<00:00:28.230> demonstrate

00:00:34.970 --> 00:00:34.980 
free stroke means that the plane finger

00:00:34.980 --> 00:00:37.760 
free stroke means that the plane finger

00:01:26.400 --> 00:01:26.410 

00:01:26.410 --> 00:01:34.420 

higher<00:01:27.430> then<00:01:30.010> we<00:01:31.010> could<00:01:31.250> have<00:01:31.660> lower<00:01:32.980> or<00:01:33.980> not

00:01:34.420 --> 00:01:34.430 
higher then we could have lower or not

00:01:34.430 --> 00:01:38.320 
higher then we could have lower or not
as<00:01:34.640> low<00:01:35.350> however<00:01:36.350> every<00:01:36.980> time<00:01:37.010> the<00:01:37.730> finger<00:01:38.090> is

00:01:38.320 --> 00:01:38.330 
as low however every time the finger is

00:01:38.330 --> 00:01:47.500 
as low however every time the finger is
lower<00:01:44.590> this<00:01:45.590> now<00:01:45.770> leads<00:01:46.070> us<00:01:46.280> to<00:01:47.030> the

00:01:47.500 --> 00:01:47.510 
lower this now leads us to the

00:01:47.510 --> 00:01:49.450 
lower this now leads us to the
collapsible<00:01:47.990> joint<00:01:48.290> rest<00:01:48.530> rope<00:01:48.740> which<00:01:49.130> I<00:01:49.280> will

00:01:49.450 --> 00:01:49.460 
collapsible joint rest rope which I will

00:01:49.460 --> 00:01:50.830 
collapsible joint rest rope which I will
demonstrate<00:01:49.970> as<00:01:50.270> follows

00:01:50.830 --> 00:01:50.840 
demonstrate as follows

00:01:50.840 --> 00:01:52.900 
demonstrate as follows
now<00:01:51.140> the<00:01:51.500> idea<00:01:51.800> behind<00:01:52.040> the<00:01:52.400> collapse<00:01:52.700> will

00:01:52.900 --> 00:01:52.910 
now the idea behind the collapse will

00:01:52.910 --> 00:01:56.469 
now the idea behind the collapse will
join<00:01:53.120> dressed<00:01:53.450> rope<00:01:53.690> goes<00:01:54.080> as<00:01:54.260> follows<00:01:55.479> by

00:01:56.469 --> 00:01:56.479 
join dressed rope goes as follows by

00:01:56.479 --> 00:01:58.810 
join dressed rope goes as follows by
setting<00:01:57.080> the<00:01:57.200> finger<00:01:57.560> in<00:01:57.830> a<00:01:57.979> slightly<00:01:58.310> bent

00:01:58.810 --> 00:01:58.820 
setting the finger in a slightly bent

00:01:58.820 --> 00:02:03.420 
setting the finger in a slightly bent
forward<00:01:59.660> position<00:02:00.410> so<00:02:01.130> the<00:02:01.280> nail<00:02:01.490> is<00:02:01.930> facing

00:02:03.420 --> 00:02:03.430 
forward position so the nail is facing

00:02:03.430 --> 00:02:09.280 
forward position so the nail is facing
downward<00:02:04.570> facing<00:02:05.710> the<00:02:06.710> Sam<00:02:06.950> board<00:02:07.990> we<00:02:08.990> apply

00:02:09.280 --> 00:02:09.290 
downward facing the Sam board we apply

00:02:09.290 --> 00:02:11.920 
downward facing the Sam board we apply
that<00:02:09.320> downward<00:02:10.040> directionally<00:02:10.820> intend<00:02:11.209> that

00:02:11.920 --> 00:02:11.930 
that downward directionally intend that

00:02:11.930 --> 00:02:15.100 
that downward directionally intend that
a<00:02:12.200> restaurant<00:02:12.830> ought<00:02:13.220> to<00:02:13.520> have<00:02:13.700> and<00:02:13.970> what<00:02:14.959> will

00:02:15.100 --> 00:02:15.110 
a restaurant ought to have and what will

00:02:15.110 --> 00:02:17.170 
a restaurant ought to have and what will
happen<00:02:15.470> is<00:02:15.709> that<00:02:15.740> because<00:02:16.580> of<00:02:16.760> something

00:02:17.170 --> 00:02:17.180 
happen is that because of something

00:02:17.180 --> 00:02:19.870 
happen is that because of something
called<00:02:17.300> string<00:02:17.750> resistance<00:02:18.260> we<00:02:19.040> gather

00:02:19.870 --> 00:02:19.880 
called string resistance we gather

00:02:19.880 --> 00:02:22.960 
called string resistance we gather
friction<00:02:20.540> force<00:02:21.040> that<00:02:22.040> this<00:02:22.430> allows<00:02:22.760> the

00:02:22.960 --> 00:02:22.970 
friction force that this allows the

00:02:22.970 --> 00:02:27.000 
friction force that this allows the
finger<00:02:23.150> from<00:02:23.450> moving<00:02:24.340> now<00:02:25.340> if<00:02:25.730> the<00:02:26.300> finger<00:02:26.660> is

00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:27.010 
finger from moving now if the finger is

00:02:27.010 --> 00:02:31.690 
finger from moving now if the finger is
relaxed<00:02:28.010> enough<00:02:28.220> at<00:02:29.200> this<00:02:30.200> joint<00:02:30.550> what<00:02:31.550> will

00:02:31.690 --> 00:02:31.700 
relaxed enough at this joint what will

00:02:31.700 --> 00:02:33.880 
relaxed enough at this joint what will
happen<00:02:32.060> is<00:02:32.269> that<00:02:32.570> by<00:02:32.750> necessity<00:02:32.810> this<00:02:33.560> joint

00:02:33.880 --> 00:02:33.890 
happen is that by necessity this joint

00:02:33.890 --> 00:02:36.720 
happen is that by necessity this joint
will<00:02:34.100> collapse<00:02:34.459> and<00:02:35.500> when<00:02:36.500> it<00:02:36.620> collapses

00:02:36.720 --> 00:02:36.730 
will collapse and when it collapses

00:02:36.730 --> 00:02:41.440 
will collapse and when it collapses
suddenly<00:02:37.730> the<00:02:37.850> nail<00:02:38.290> is<00:02:39.290> facing<00:02:39.860> upward<00:02:40.760> in

00:02:41.440 --> 00:02:41.450 
suddenly the nail is facing upward in

00:02:41.450 --> 00:02:44.250 
suddenly the nail is facing upward in
relation<00:02:41.959> to<00:02:41.989> the<00:02:42.200> horizontal<00:02:42.650> plane<00:02:42.739> and

00:02:44.250 --> 00:02:44.260 
relation to the horizontal plane and

00:02:44.260 --> 00:02:48.009 
relation to the horizontal plane and
this<00:02:45.260> reduces<00:02:46.250> the<00:02:47.030> friction<00:02:47.390> caused<00:02:47.810> by

00:02:48.009 --> 00:02:48.019 
this reduces the friction caused by

00:02:48.019 --> 00:02:50.920 
this reduces the friction caused by
strong<00:02:48.230> resistance<00:02:48.850> thus<00:02:49.850> allowing<00:02:50.600> the

00:02:50.920 --> 00:02:50.930 
strong resistance thus allowing the

00:02:50.930 --> 00:02:55.270 
strong resistance thus allowing the
finger<00:02:51.320> to<00:02:51.860> travel<00:02:52.570> downward<00:02:54.040> across<00:02:55.040> the

00:02:55.270 --> 00:02:55.280 
finger to travel downward across the

00:02:55.280 --> 00:02:57.699 
finger to travel downward across the
string

00:02:57.699 --> 00:02:57.709 

00:02:57.709 --> 00:03:02.050 

landing<00:02:58.340> on<00:02:58.659> the<00:02:59.659> following<00:02:59.989> string<00:03:00.379> in<00:03:01.060> this
