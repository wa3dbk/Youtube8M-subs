00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.859
 hello children good here I bring you this 

00:00:02.820 --> 00:00:06.569
 new video which I wanted to make 

00:00:04.859 --> 00:00:09.929
 time but that certain circumstances 

00:00:06.569 --> 00:00:12.179
 they did not let me good this video is not a 

00:00:09.929 --> 00:00:14.880
 criticism as such to this anime just 

00:00:12.179 --> 00:00:17.550
 I will give 5 reasons not to see black rock 

00:00:14.880 --> 00:00:19.350
 shopper for those who do not know here I 

00:00:17.550 --> 00:00:21.600
 I'm focusing on your animated version 

00:00:19.350 --> 00:00:24.180
 for television I'm not focusing 

00:00:21.600 --> 00:00:26.699
 in the work I'm not focusing on the 

00:00:24.180 --> 00:00:29.279
 manga and I'm not focusing on the 

00:00:26.699 --> 00:00:31.170
 videogame although these last two are 

00:00:29.279 --> 00:00:33.210
 better than their shitty versions 

00:00:31.170 --> 00:00:37.829
 animated already with nothing more to add 

00:00:33.210 --> 00:00:40.170
 let's start with this thing the open good 

00:00:37.829 --> 00:00:42.090
 maybe this is the stupidest and 

00:00:40.170 --> 00:00:44.399
 relevant reason why I want 

00:00:42.090 --> 00:00:46.980
 discredit this series but I have 

00:00:44.399 --> 00:00:49.020
 my reasons do not misunderstand me 

00:00:46.980 --> 00:00:51.030
 opening is a good piece and one that 

00:00:49.020 --> 00:00:53.460
 I like it a lot but this one is pretty 

00:00:51.030 --> 00:00:55.079
 deceitful only show us only the 

00:00:53.460 --> 00:00:57.149
 scenes where they appear and blackrock 

00:00:55.079 --> 00:00:59.280
 souter and the other personalities 

00:00:57.149 --> 00:01:01.410
 instead of showing us the series as 

00:00:59.280 --> 00:01:03.570
 is it really paints us that it will be a 

00:01:01.410 --> 00:01:05.189
 series full of action but sometimes what 

00:01:03.570 --> 00:01:06.900
 that goes the series can fuck you the 

00:01:05.189 --> 00:01:09.210
 expectations that you had of the 

00:01:06.900 --> 00:01:11.340
 and right after finishing and although the 

00:01:09.210 --> 00:01:15.870
 lyrics and the melody are relatively 

00:01:11.340 --> 00:01:17.910
 okay your lesbian solutions albeit 

00:01:15.870 --> 00:01:20.010
 this is something of the most notorious and annoying 

00:01:17.910 --> 00:01:21.960
 of what we will see in this anime this more 

00:01:20.010 --> 00:01:24.150
 that nothing we will see on the part of mathó and 

00:01:21.960 --> 00:01:26.070
 I know that according to what you want to be friends with 

00:01:24.150 --> 00:01:27.750
 johnny for being a colorful girl with 

00:01:26.070 --> 00:01:30.120
 a lesbian relationship more than obvious 

00:01:27.750 --> 00:01:33.150
 although they only need to make scissors to 

00:01:30.120 --> 00:01:35.760
 confirm it lol and these allusions are 

00:01:33.150 --> 00:01:36.900
 so the highlight is the cast number 

00:01:35.760 --> 00:01:39.420
 3 

00:01:36.900 --> 00:01:41.369
 Suspend the dialogues that have already 

00:01:39.420 --> 00:01:43.860
 seen the series will know what I'm talking about 

00:01:41.369 --> 00:01:46.110
 these dialogues mostly come to 

00:01:43.860 --> 00:01:48.300
 become somewhat incoherent and stupid 

00:01:46.110 --> 00:01:50.340
 not to say it is the main 

00:01:48.300 --> 00:01:52.710
 reasons why this series is 

00:01:50.340 --> 00:01:54.780
 full of lesbian allusions reaching 

00:01:52.710 --> 00:01:57.119
 To become quite corny and pointless 

00:01:54.780 --> 00:01:59.160
 one that we could confuse with a 

00:01:57.119 --> 00:02:01.410
 television novel some come to 

00:01:59.160 --> 00:02:03.450
 become somewhat pretentious that 

00:02:01.410 --> 00:02:05.610
 even when you see the series you say what 

00:02:03.450 --> 00:02:07.800
 rays was thought the director of this 

00:02:05.610 --> 00:02:10.080
 good thing was to be expected from the same 

00:02:07.800 --> 00:02:11.910
 asshole that brought us this shit in addition 

00:02:10.080 --> 00:02:13.069
 of being quite uncomfortable and little 

00:02:11.910 --> 00:02:14.629
 credible 

00:02:13.069 --> 00:02:16.849
 they want to put the flat 

00:02:14.629 --> 00:02:19.040
 personalities of the protagonists not 

00:02:16.849 --> 00:02:20.900
 you will spend a chapter without anyone 

00:02:19.040 --> 00:02:22.819
 leave with those shits of the power of 

00:02:20.900 --> 00:02:27.049
 love besides the pseudo relationship 

00:02:22.819 --> 00:02:29.420
 lesbian between me I kill your characters 

00:02:27.049 --> 00:02:31.939
 it's good that at first everything 

00:02:29.420 --> 00:02:33.680
 endure your bullshit being pretty 

00:02:31.939 --> 00:02:35.870
 Flat and tasteless for the public 

00:02:33.680 --> 00:02:38.209
 becoming upset to some extent 

00:02:35.870 --> 00:02:40.700
 of the series where you even get to have 

00:02:38.209 --> 00:02:43.099
 desire for one to suffer a collapse or be 

00:02:40.700 --> 00:02:45.200
 thrown by an annoying bus 

00:02:43.099 --> 00:02:47.510
 that they become more than anything a 

00:02:45.200 --> 00:02:49.669
 cast plagued by women at least 

00:02:47.510 --> 00:02:51.469
 thanks you for not being a fucking cast 

00:02:49.669 --> 00:02:53.900
 of characters that you do not finish 

00:02:51.469 --> 00:02:56.209
 learn their fucking names but god that 

00:02:53.900 --> 00:02:57.980
 all be a group of pseudo lesbians 

00:02:56.209 --> 00:02:59.989
 fed up to a certain point that you want 

00:02:57.980 --> 00:03:02.510
 leave the series right to the first half 

00:02:59.989 --> 00:03:04.579
 of it but fuck they are so flat and 

00:03:02.510 --> 00:03:06.530
 nor developed mothers being 

00:03:04.579 --> 00:03:08.569
 francs, there's nothing that makes you 

00:03:06.530 --> 00:03:10.819
 identify yourself with the characters or 

00:03:08.569 --> 00:03:12.620
 minimally sympathize with them is 

00:03:10.819 --> 00:03:14.900
 barking you in the brain your whores 

00:03:12.620 --> 00:03:16.760
 more personalities not being able to reach 

00:03:14.900 --> 00:03:18.470
 certain point that you want the whore 

00:03:16.760 --> 00:03:19.460
 series ends in the next chapter 

00:03:18.470 --> 00:03:21.410
 even 

00:03:19.460 --> 00:03:23.630
 you wonder how much self-love you have 

00:03:21.410 --> 00:03:26.120
 as to finish it even though they are 

00:03:23.630 --> 00:03:27.710
 only 8 chapters during the series were 

00:03:26.120 --> 00:03:29.870
 they end up returning characters 

00:03:27.710 --> 00:03:31.850
 detestable even in the end their 

00:03:29.870 --> 00:03:34.070
 pendejas personalities prevail at 

00:03:31.850 --> 00:03:36.140
 final in addition to the background that 

00:03:34.070 --> 00:03:38.480
 he tried to for me in the end everything goes 

00:03:36.140 --> 00:03:40.790
 to hell in less than two chapters the 

00:03:38.480 --> 00:03:44.110
 characters in themselves do not arouse sympathy 

00:03:40.790 --> 00:03:47.420
 that make you want to take them out of their misery 

00:03:44.110 --> 00:03:49.910
 the plot well as everyone should know 

00:03:47.420 --> 00:03:51.950
 this anime was based on his own work 

00:03:49.910 --> 00:03:54.650
 but it's more than anything like a king where 

00:03:51.950 --> 00:03:56.600
 the facts of this blackrock sotet has 

00:03:54.650 --> 00:03:58.220
 enough elements in your plot like 

00:03:56.600 --> 00:04:00.530
 to attract a typical audience 

00:03:58.220 --> 00:04:02.210
 conformist and stupid as well as for the 

00:04:00.530 --> 00:04:04.340
 public that enjoys pury so much 

00:04:02.210 --> 00:04:06.440
 direct as indirectly plagued by 

00:04:04.340 --> 00:04:08.690
 stereotypes and clichés and different types 

00:04:06.440 --> 00:04:10.550
 of fun services to attract everything 

00:04:08.690 --> 00:04:12.860
 type of audience which has a 

00:04:10.550 --> 00:04:15.050
 story without feet or head as well as 

00:04:12.860 --> 00:04:16.730
 pretty poor at least aside 

00:04:15.050 --> 00:04:18.710
 I recognize that despite having 

00:04:16.730 --> 00:04:20.810
 several of the errors that account 

00:04:18.710 --> 00:04:23.120
 the anime tells us everything goes so 

00:04:20.810 --> 00:04:25.250
 nice although they minimized a little 

00:04:23.120 --> 00:04:26.000
 lesbian insinuations when putting a 

00:04:25.250 --> 00:04:28.370
 cast more 

00:04:26.000 --> 00:04:31.070
 big as well as everyone acted like a 

00:04:28.370 --> 00:04:33.560
 pinches locas black rock show terenci es 

00:04:31.070 --> 00:04:35.270
 a rather pretentious work the series 

00:04:33.560 --> 00:04:37.460
 in that it's pretty boring with 

00:04:35.270 --> 00:04:39.620
 chapters only focused on this pair of 

00:04:37.460 --> 00:04:41.750
 lesbians when for the only thing that is not 

00:04:39.620 --> 00:04:44.030
 send the shit the series were themselves 

00:04:41.750 --> 00:04:46.070
 more superficial aspects as they were 

00:04:44.030 --> 00:04:48.350
 the design of the other personalities and 

00:04:46.070 --> 00:04:50.630
 from the other world with somewhat loose fights 

00:04:48.350 --> 00:04:52.700
 but entertaining that was the only thing that 

00:04:50.630 --> 00:04:54.560
 it was worth seeing in this shabby series 

00:04:52.700 --> 00:04:56.270
 but at least I recognize the 

00:04:54.560 --> 00:04:58.250
 series that wanted to put something new to the 

00:04:56.270 --> 00:05:00.980
 gender but you know that originality 

00:04:58.250 --> 00:05:02.930
 is not always good the end is what 

00:05:00.980 --> 00:05:04.850
 ends by burying this series in the 

00:05:02.930 --> 00:05:07.040
 deeper things of hell 

00:05:04.850 --> 00:05:09.110
 trying to detect a greater background 

00:05:07.040 --> 00:05:11.390
 to the characters but everything here pushing 

00:05:09.110 --> 00:05:13.250
 so disgustingly quickly and if 

00:05:11.390 --> 00:05:15.290
 well neither the characters were 

00:05:13.250 --> 00:05:17.240
 developed leaving them flatter than 

00:05:15.290 --> 00:05:19.220
 a runway but at the time 

00:05:17.240 --> 00:05:21.290
 of wanting to give the background does it 

00:05:19.220 --> 00:05:23.240
 hurried way that already for this point 

00:05:21.290 --> 00:05:25.040
 Nobody cares what happens to 

00:05:23.240 --> 00:05:27.169
 the characters just wanting to see one 

00:05:25.040 --> 00:05:29.270
 decent final battle trying to 

00:05:27.169 --> 00:05:31.250
 get us pseudo psychological problems 

00:05:29.270 --> 00:05:32.260
 of the characters and ones that although 

00:05:31.250 --> 00:05:34.660
 they had potential 

00:05:32.260 --> 00:05:36.820
 to be fairly interesting they throw 

00:05:34.660 --> 00:05:39.010
 all in the trash just to focus on 

00:05:36.820 --> 00:05:41.290
 characters that nobody cares about but 

00:05:39.010 --> 00:05:43.020
 just after all consistency that 

00:05:41.290 --> 00:05:45.460
 I had was quite poor and mediocre 

00:05:43.020 --> 00:05:47.470
 well after the first two 

00:05:45.460 --> 00:05:49.840
 episodes everything starts to fall in what 

00:05:47.470 --> 00:05:52.570
 repetitive first an idiot has a 

00:05:49.840 --> 00:05:54.640
 problem 2 appears blackrock souter 3 le 

00:05:52.570 --> 00:05:56.650
 kick the ass to that other personality and 

00:05:54.640 --> 00:05:58.630
 all that is repeated during the 

00:05:56.650 --> 00:06:00.430
 rest of the series but the ending is what 

00:05:58.630 --> 00:06:02.710
 who finished burying this thing 

00:06:00.430 --> 00:06:04.660
 leaving it as one of the worst animes 

00:06:02.710 --> 00:06:06.760
 I've seen this year first we have 

00:06:04.660 --> 00:06:08.950
 that joey the psychologist has the power to 

00:06:06.760 --> 00:06:11.260
 see towards the other world we see a couple of 

00:06:08.950 --> 00:06:13.150
 boring flashback and that's when 

00:06:11.260 --> 00:06:15.250
 in case you lose all interest in the 

00:06:13.150 --> 00:06:17.260
 characters arrived at this point and 

00:06:15.250 --> 00:06:19.630
 you just want to finish the whore 

00:06:17.260 --> 00:06:21.820
 series at the end mallet meeting with 

00:06:19.630 --> 00:06:23.680
 blackrock souter just to serve 

00:06:21.820 --> 00:06:25.630
 mop but itself after a 

00:06:23.680 --> 00:06:27.700
 fight killed in the end gathers forces 

00:06:25.630 --> 00:06:29.620
 thanks to the power of love having one 

00:06:27.700 --> 00:06:32.140
 of the most blatant deus ex machchina and 

00:06:29.620 --> 00:06:34.450
 insulting is almost as insulting as 

00:06:32.140 --> 00:06:35.910
 natsu defeating sham crowe if so 

00:06:34.450 --> 00:06:37.980
 insulting is 

00:06:35.910 --> 00:06:40.320
 already to finish the only thing I have left 

00:06:37.980 --> 00:06:42.540
 to say is that the design of characters and 

00:06:40.320 --> 00:06:44.490
 of stage is pretty good more than 

00:06:42.540 --> 00:06:46.650
 nothing in the other world but that's not 

00:06:44.490 --> 00:06:48.570
 make up for the detestable characters 

00:06:46.650 --> 00:06:50.610
 and the plot so insubstantial and wrong 

00:06:48.570 --> 00:06:52.500
 written ending as a work 

00:06:50.610 --> 00:06:54.900
 pretty mediocre that will stay in the 

00:06:52.500 --> 00:06:59.060
 forgotten after its completion good 

00:06:54.900 --> 00:06:59.060
 already with nothing more to add I dismiss
