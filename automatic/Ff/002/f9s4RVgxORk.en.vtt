00:00:08.030 --> 00:00:13.290
 good afternoon friends today we will tell 

00:00:11.610 --> 00:00:14.490
 how to change a light bulb 

00:00:13.290 --> 00:00:18.800
 switch panel lights 

00:00:14.490 --> 00:00:21.689
 Renault Minibus Heater 

00:00:18.800 --> 00:00:26.609
 for this you need to remove the shogi 

00:00:21.689 --> 00:00:28.789
 radio from the lower panel is inserted 

00:00:26.609 --> 00:00:33.199
 the former owner without a metal frame 

00:00:28.789 --> 00:00:33.199
 so it can be removed very easily 

00:00:34.309 --> 00:00:37.730
 practically effortless 

00:00:53.560 --> 00:00:58.590
 disconnect the antenna plug and connector 

00:00:56.530 --> 00:00:58.590
 power supply 

00:01:10.520 --> 00:01:18.579
 and gently hide the wires in the inside 

00:01:14.170 --> 00:01:18.579
 so as not to interfere with the subsequent work 

00:01:23.750 --> 00:01:30.860
 through the niche of the radio network available terminal 

00:01:25.820 --> 00:01:34.540
 glove compartment snaps neatly thin 

00:01:30.860 --> 00:01:37.160
 screwdriver push it in 

00:01:34.540 --> 00:01:41.690
 pushing the glove box out and taking out 

00:01:37.160 --> 00:01:44.270
 it has four latches on it 

00:01:41.690 --> 00:01:48.430
 but since we freed up niche sit radio 

00:01:44.270 --> 00:01:48.430
 they used only one latch 

00:01:52.240 --> 00:01:57.410
 Looking ahead I will say that the light bulb 

00:01:54.470 --> 00:01:58.930
 Highlights here is one since I saw this 

00:01:57.410 --> 00:02:01.790
 disassembly panel 

00:01:58.930 --> 00:02:10.459
 it is between the left and the center 

00:02:01.790 --> 00:02:12.080
 a regulator of a heater both regulators 

00:02:10.459 --> 00:02:14.440
 need to put in the extreme right 

00:02:12.080 --> 00:02:14.440
 position 

00:02:19.940 --> 00:02:25.360
 you need a mirror to find a light bulb 

00:02:22.070 --> 00:02:25.360
 and flashlight 

00:02:37.100 --> 00:02:42.470
 as we see the light bulb together with the patron 

00:02:39.200 --> 00:02:45.100
 rectangular profile she is in 

00:02:42.470 --> 00:02:45.100
 burial 

00:02:48.620 --> 00:02:53.580
 to turn it fit 

00:02:51.960 --> 00:02:56.480
 ordinary building plastic 

00:02:53.580 --> 00:02:56.480
 dowel a dozen 

00:03:02.090 --> 00:03:06.500
 the main thing to pick up the profile and length 

00:03:18.190 --> 00:03:24.180
 as the place inside the niche is a little uber 

00:03:21.430 --> 00:03:24.180
 take a shorter 

00:03:36.600 --> 00:03:41.580
 groping cartridge chuck out against 

00:03:38.640 --> 00:03:43.940
 clockwise and take out the burned out 

00:03:41.580 --> 00:03:43.940
 light bulb 

00:03:50.480 --> 00:03:55.599
 light bulb with a chuck well kept in 

00:03:53.000 --> 00:03:55.599
 our dowel 

00:04:01.560 --> 00:04:05.989
 There are different variants of ammo 

00:04:03.630 --> 00:04:08.310
 light bulbs 

00:04:05.989 --> 00:04:15.569
 we select the necessary diameter and 

00:04:08.310 --> 00:04:19.940
 pin location on our light bulb 

00:04:15.569 --> 00:04:25.590
 new chuck profile already hex 

00:04:19.940 --> 00:04:28.260
 6 millimeters wide and so for his 

00:04:25.590 --> 00:04:31.610
 a small head will fit 

00:04:28.260 --> 00:04:31.610
 with short extension 

00:04:47.370 --> 00:04:53.570
 to chuck bail and sit tight 

00:04:49.370 --> 00:04:53.570
 we put a piece of thin paper 

00:05:07.320 --> 00:05:13.210
 put the cartridge socket wrap it 

00:05:10.210 --> 00:05:17.110
 If you look from the inside then clockwise 

00:05:13.210 --> 00:05:20.100
 Arrow glove box and insert it insert 

00:05:17.110 --> 00:05:20.100
 in place in reverse order 

00:05:23.320 --> 00:05:30.090
