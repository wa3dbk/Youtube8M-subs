I say "This is gentle taste??" maybe you guys react "What??"

00:01:48.542 --> 00:01:58.020
I've read Tanita recipe book before and There's question.
If I cook just like book there's no salt taste and Umami 

00:01:58.018 --> 00:02:07.690
I worried taste but no problem. Reduce no need seasonings
and Philosophicate ingredients quality makes taste gentle!!

make dishes from "Tanita recipe book" or come here!!
