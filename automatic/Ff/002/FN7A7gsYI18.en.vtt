bismillah<00:00:02.610> question<00:00:03.419> number<00:00:03.629> five<00:00:03.840> the

00:00:04.460 --> 00:00:04.470 
bismillah question number five the

00:00:04.470 --> 00:00:07.010 
bismillah question number five the
diagram<00:00:04.950> shows<00:00:05.160> the<00:00:05.190> curve<00:00:05.490> is<00:00:05.670> equation<00:00:06.270> X

00:00:07.010 --> 00:00:07.020 
diagram shows the curve is equation X

00:00:07.020 --> 00:00:09.530 
diagram shows the curve is equation X
square<00:00:07.200> plus<00:00:07.470> XY<00:00:08.069> squared<00:00:08.189> is<00:00:08.790> a<00:00:09.000> y<00:00:09.150> square

00:00:09.530 --> 00:00:09.540 
square plus XY squared is a y square

00:00:09.540 --> 00:00:12.110 
square plus XY squared is a y square
minus<00:00:09.599> four<00:00:10.050> X<00:00:10.380> squares<00:00:10.830> four<00:00:11.070> to<00:00:11.160> zero<00:00:11.190> where

00:00:12.110 --> 00:00:12.120 
minus four X squares four to zero where

00:00:12.120 --> 00:00:14.390 
minus four X squares four to zero where
is<00:00:12.150> a<00:00:12.269> positive<00:00:12.719> constant<00:00:12.960> and<00:00:13.410> instantly<00:00:14.309> we

00:00:14.390 --> 00:00:14.400 
is a positive constant and instantly we

00:00:14.400 --> 00:00:16.460 
is a positive constant and instantly we
see<00:00:14.580> that<00:00:14.730> this<00:00:14.880> is<00:00:14.940> implicit<00:00:15.540> isn't<00:00:16.139> it

00:00:16.460 --> 00:00:16.470 
see that this is implicit isn't it

00:00:16.470 --> 00:00:18.920 
see that this is implicit isn't it
the<00:00:17.160> maximum<00:00:17.580> point<00:00:17.789> on<00:00:17.880> the<00:00:17.970> curve<00:00:18.150> is<00:00:18.330> M<00:00:18.480> man

00:00:18.920 --> 00:00:18.930 
the maximum point on the curve is M man

00:00:18.930 --> 00:00:21.019 
the maximum point on the curve is M man
find<00:00:19.410> the<00:00:19.560> coordinate<00:00:19.980> of<00:00:20.010> M<00:00:20.279> in<00:00:20.550> terms<00:00:20.789> of<00:00:20.910> a

00:00:21.019 --> 00:00:21.029 
find the coordinate of M in terms of a

00:00:21.029 --> 00:00:24.859 
find the coordinate of M in terms of a
so<00:00:21.990> if<00:00:22.439> M<00:00:22.830> is<00:00:22.859> the<00:00:23.070> maximum<00:00:23.480> so<00:00:24.480> we<00:00:24.510> will<00:00:24.720> have

00:00:24.859 --> 00:00:24.869 
so if M is the maximum so we will have

00:00:24.869 --> 00:00:26.929 
so if M is the maximum so we will have
to<00:00:25.019> find<00:00:25.590> the<00:00:25.710> coordinate<00:00:26.220> at<00:00:26.400> stationary

00:00:26.929 --> 00:00:26.939 
to find the coordinate at stationary

00:00:26.939 --> 00:00:29.480 
to find the coordinate at stationary
point<00:00:27.269> that<00:00:27.539> is<00:00:27.689> divided<00:00:28.050> by<00:00:28.170> DX<00:00:28.380> so<00:00:29.189> we<00:00:29.340> will

00:00:29.480 --> 00:00:29.490 
point that is divided by DX so we will

00:00:29.490 --> 00:00:31.970 
point that is divided by DX so we will
have<00:00:29.640> to<00:00:29.880> differentiate<00:00:30.660> both<00:00:31.619> sides<00:00:31.679> with

00:00:31.970 --> 00:00:31.980 
have to differentiate both sides with

00:00:31.980 --> 00:00:36.830 
have to differentiate both sides with
respect<00:00:32.099> to<00:00:32.520> X<00:00:33.649> differentiate<00:00:35.390> each<00:00:36.390> and

00:00:36.830 --> 00:00:36.840 
respect to X differentiate each and

00:00:36.840 --> 00:00:41.389 
respect to X differentiate each and
every<00:00:37.200> term<00:00:37.440> by<00:00:38.420> with<00:00:39.420> respect<00:00:39.450> X<00:00:39.960> okay<00:00:40.770> so

00:00:41.389 --> 00:00:41.399 
every term by with respect X okay so

00:00:41.399 --> 00:00:43.160 
every term by with respect X okay so
when<00:00:41.730> differentiate<00:00:42.270> X<00:00:42.540> chip<00:00:42.809> we<00:00:42.930> are<00:00:42.989> going

00:00:43.160 --> 00:00:43.170 
when differentiate X chip we are going

00:00:43.170 --> 00:00:46.130 
when differentiate X chip we are going
to<00:00:43.260> get<00:00:43.379> 3x<00:00:43.829> square<00:00:44.340> here<00:00:45.210> the<00:00:45.629> case<00:00:45.870> is

00:00:46.130 --> 00:00:46.140 
to get 3x square here the case is

00:00:46.140 --> 00:00:47.180 
to get 3x square here the case is
different

00:00:47.180 --> 00:00:47.190 
different

00:00:47.190 --> 00:00:49.400 
different
why<00:00:47.520> because<00:00:48.390> here<00:00:48.570> we<00:00:48.719> should<00:00:48.780> be<00:00:48.989> applying

00:00:49.400 --> 00:00:49.410 
why because here we should be applying

00:00:49.410 --> 00:00:51.619 
why because here we should be applying
for<00:00:49.829> the<00:00:49.920> cruel<00:00:50.160> okay<00:00:51.000> I'm<00:00:51.180> going<00:00:51.360> to<00:00:51.449> date

for the cruel okay I'm going to date

00:00:51.629 --> 00:00:56.720 
for the cruel okay I'm going to date
here<00:00:52.430> you<00:00:53.430> would<00:00:53.850> be<00:00:54.030> x<00:00:54.570> and<00:00:55.289> if<00:00:55.770> it<00:00:55.920> would<00:00:56.070> be<00:00:56.219> Y

00:00:56.720 --> 00:00:56.730 
here you would be x and if it would be Y

it would have been what do it having 2
XY<00:01:15.479> dy<00:01:16.320> by<00:01:16.500> DX<00:01:16.710> plus<00:01:17.600> y<00:01:18.600> square<00:01:19.049> okay<00:01:19.710> so<00:01:20.490> like

00:01:21.260 --> 00:01:21.270 
XY dy by DX plus y square okay so like

00:01:21.270 --> 00:01:27.020 
XY dy by DX plus y square okay so like
yeah<00:01:21.540> Plus<00:01:22.259> what<00:01:22.530> 2<00:01:23.369> XY<00:01:23.720> dy<00:01:24.720> by<00:01:24.900> DX<00:01:25.080> plus<00:01:26.030> y

00:01:27.020 --> 00:01:27.030 
yeah Plus what 2 XY dy by DX plus y

00:01:27.030 --> 00:01:31.429 
yeah Plus what 2 XY dy by DX plus y
square<00:01:27.360> plus<00:01:28.189> we<00:01:29.189> differentiate<00:01:29.520> this<00:01:29.900> to<00:01:30.900> a<00:01:31.200> Y

00:01:31.429 --> 00:01:31.439 
square plus we differentiate this to a Y

00:01:31.439 --> 00:01:34.130 
square plus we differentiate this to a Y
dy<00:01:32.310> by<00:01:32.640> DX<00:01:32.850> okay<00:01:33.780> because<00:01:33.900> we're

00:01:34.130 --> 00:01:34.140 
dy by DX okay because we're

00:01:34.140 --> 00:01:35.870 
dy by DX okay because we're
differentiating<00:01:34.380> well<00:01:34.829> and<00:01:35.400> here<00:01:35.700> it's<00:01:35.820> going

00:01:35.870 --> 00:01:35.880 
differentiating well and here it's going

00:01:35.880 --> 00:01:39.010 
differentiating well and here it's going
to<00:01:36.119> be<00:01:36.210> minus<00:01:36.630> 6x<00:01:37.229> which<00:01:38.040> is<00:01:38.189> good<00:01:38.400> to

00:01:39.010 --> 00:01:39.020 
to be minus 6x which is good to

00:01:39.020 --> 00:01:41.569 
to be minus 6x which is good to
differentiate<00:01:40.020> zero<00:01:40.290> gets<00:01:40.530> zero<00:01:40.740> so<00:01:41.369> what<00:01:41.460> we

00:01:41.569 --> 00:01:41.579 
differentiate zero gets zero so what we

00:01:41.579 --> 00:01:43.310 
differentiate zero gets zero so what we
are<00:01:41.670> going<00:01:41.820> to<00:01:41.909> do<00:01:42.030> is<00:01:42.329> we<00:01:42.540> keep<00:01:42.689> all<00:01:42.930> the<00:01:42.960> terms

00:01:43.310 --> 00:01:43.320 
are going to do is we keep all the terms

00:01:43.320 --> 00:01:45.050 
are going to do is we keep all the terms
are<00:01:43.560> divided<00:01:43.799> by<00:01:43.920> DX<00:01:44.100> on<00:01:44.430> the<00:01:44.460> left<00:01:44.700> hand<00:01:44.880> side

00:01:45.050 --> 00:01:45.060 
are divided by DX on the left hand side

00:01:45.060 --> 00:01:46.850 
are divided by DX on the left hand side
and<00:01:45.299> the<00:01:46.110> other<00:01:46.320> terms

00:01:46.850 --> 00:01:46.860 
and the other terms

00:01:46.860 --> 00:01:49.990 
and the other terms
no<00:01:47.220> concern<00:01:47.670> them<00:01:47.909> on<00:01:48.240> the<00:01:48.600> other<00:01:48.810> side<00:01:48.930> okay

00:01:49.990 --> 00:01:50.000 
no concern them on the other side okay

00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:52.910 
no concern them on the other side okay
this<00:01:51.000> is<00:01:51.090> going<00:01:51.299> to<00:01:51.450> be<00:01:51.619> 6x

00:01:52.910 --> 00:01:52.920 
this is going to be 6x

00:01:52.920 --> 00:01:57.109 
this is going to be 6x
mm<00:01:54.110> minus<00:01:55.110> three<00:01:55.350> X<00:01:55.470> square<00:01:55.619> minus<00:01:56.310> y<00:01:56.579> square

00:01:57.109 --> 00:01:57.119 
mm minus three X square minus y square

00:01:57.119 --> 00:02:01.459 
mm minus three X square minus y square
okay<00:01:58.490> so<00:01:59.490> here<00:01:59.700> it<00:01:59.820> is<00:02:00.000> a<00:02:00.030> dy<00:02:00.360> by<00:02:00.509> DX<00:02:00.689> common

00:02:01.459 --> 00:02:01.469 
okay so here it is a dy by DX common

00:02:01.469 --> 00:02:07.940 
okay so here it is a dy by DX common
dy<00:02:02.460> by<00:02:02.640> DX<00:02:02.850> is<00:02:03.060> common<00:02:04.460> so<00:02:05.630> it's<00:02:06.630> 2x<00:02:06.840> y<00:02:07.200> plus<00:02:07.530> 2a

00:02:07.940 --> 00:02:07.950 
dy by DX is common so it's 2x y plus 2a

00:02:07.950 --> 00:02:11.990 
dy by DX is common so it's 2x y plus 2a
Y<00:02:08.629> it<00:02:09.629> should<00:02:09.899> be<00:02:10.310> 6a

00:02:11.990 --> 00:02:12.000 
Y it should be 6a

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:17.520 
Y it should be 6a
ok<00:02:13.800> -<00:02:14.800> 4<00:02:15.160> X<00:02:15.250> square<00:02:15.610> minus<00:02:16.600> y<00:02:16.840> square

00:02:17.520 --> 00:02:17.530 
ok - 4 X square minus y square

00:02:17.530 --> 00:02:21.420 
ok - 4 X square minus y square
so<00:02:18.370> dy<00:02:18.610> by<00:02:18.880> DX<00:02:19.090> is<00:02:19.750> going<00:02:19.960> to<00:02:20.200> be<00:02:20.290> what<00:02:20.560> it's

00:02:21.420 --> 00:02:21.430 
so dy by DX is going to be what it's

00:02:21.430 --> 00:02:25.410 
so dy by DX is going to be what it's
going<00:02:21.700> to<00:02:21.850> be<00:02:21.970> 6<00:02:22.900> X<00:02:23.110> minus<00:02:23.740> 3<00:02:23.980> X<00:02:24.010> square<00:02:24.340> minus<00:02:25.150> y

00:02:25.410 --> 00:02:25.420 
going to be 6 X minus 3 X square minus y

00:02:25.420 --> 00:02:27.750 
going to be 6 X minus 3 X square minus y
square<00:02:25.990> which<00:02:26.290> has<00:02:26.440> been<00:02:26.590> divided<00:02:26.920> by<00:02:27.160> 2x<00:02:27.520> y

00:02:27.750 --> 00:02:27.760 
square which has been divided by 2x y

00:02:27.760 --> 00:02:34.920

plus<00:02:28.600> 2<00:02:28.990> ay<00:02:29.260> Y<00:02:30.150> ok<00:02:31.150> good<00:02:31.780> so<00:02:33.180> now<00:02:34.180> what<00:02:34.690> do<00:02:34.810> we

00:02:34.920 --> 00:02:34.930 
plus 2 ay Y ok good so now what do we

00:02:34.930 --> 00:02:38.240 
plus 2 ay Y ok good so now what do we
know<00:02:35.110> we<00:02:35.920> know<00:02:36.040> that<00:02:36.250> at<00:02:36.430> stationary<00:02:37.180> point<00:02:37.450> at

00:02:38.240 --> 00:02:38.250 
know we know that at stationary point at

00:02:38.250 --> 00:02:44.340 
know we know that at stationary point at
stationary<00:02:39.810> point<00:02:40.980> what<00:02:41.980> happened<00:02:42.930> dy<00:02:43.930> by<00:02:44.110> DX

00:02:44.340 --> 00:02:44.350 
stationary point what happened dy by DX

00:02:44.350 --> 00:02:50.280 
stationary point what happened dy by DX
should<00:02:45.280> be<00:02:45.430> 0<00:02:46.740> ok<00:02:47.790> so<00:02:48.790> what<00:02:49.540> would<00:02:49.720> happen<00:02:50.110> is

00:02:50.280 --> 00:02:50.290 
should be 0 ok so what would happen is

00:02:50.290 --> 00:02:54.720 
should be 0 ok so what would happen is
that<00:02:50.910> 6x<00:02:51.960> -<00:02:52.960> 3<00:02:52.990> X<00:02:53.350> square<00:02:53.530> minus<00:02:53.950> y<00:02:54.190> square

00:02:54.720 --> 00:02:54.730 
that 6x - 3 X square minus y square
