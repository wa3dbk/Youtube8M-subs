00:00:04.819 --> 00:00:09.990
 hello welfare friends added net 

00:00:07.740 --> 00:00:13.290
 today I will prepare one of the legendary ones 

00:00:09.990 --> 00:00:14.549
 favorite the ricotta crumbled e 

00:00:13.290 --> 00:00:16.800
 chocolate 

00:00:14.549 --> 00:00:18.990
 I already have some drops of 

00:00:16.800 --> 00:00:21.500
 dark chocolate but if you don't 

00:00:18.990 --> 00:00:24.930
 you have you can put in the mug 

00:00:21.500 --> 00:00:27.810
 dry the pieces of dark chocolate 

00:00:24.930 --> 00:00:31.199
 and chop it gradually bringing it to 

00:00:27.810 --> 00:00:34.230
 speed 8 and then of course put it 

00:00:31.199 --> 00:00:37.170
 the partner iacone buccal the flour and the 

00:00:34.230 --> 00:00:41.160
 butter in pieces and leave to give for 10 

00:00:37.170 --> 00:00:44.700
 seconds at speed 5 the dough should 

00:00:41.160 --> 00:00:48.570
 to be sandy we add the place 

00:00:44.700 --> 00:00:51.360
 sugar and yeast and its send 

00:00:48.570 --> 00:00:54.420
 for 15 seconds speed 6 

00:00:51.360 --> 00:00:56.579
 here is the dough of the sbriciolona it 

00:00:54.420 --> 00:01:00.210
 we put in the fridge in the meantime that 

00:00:56.579 --> 00:01:03.090
 we prepare the ingredients for the 

00:01:00.210 --> 00:01:06.000
 filling now we put in the mug also 

00:01:03.090 --> 00:01:09.420
 without washing the ricotta and the sugar e 

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:11.450
 vanillin and if you want you can 

00:01:09.420 --> 00:01:13.460
 add between tablespoons of milk 

00:01:11.450 --> 00:01:17.000
 personally 

00:01:13.460 --> 00:01:20.060
 I gave milk because I like one 

00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:23.030
 denser consistency and I go to the 

00:01:20.060 --> 00:01:26.390
 all for 10 seconds speed three o 

00:01:23.030 --> 00:01:29.540
 four warm the oven to 180 fat 

00:01:26.390 --> 00:01:33.110
 stitch the bottom with the paper from 

00:01:29.540 --> 00:01:37.720
 Ghribi baked a pan of 24 cm 

00:01:33.110 --> 00:01:43.250
 half the diameter of the crumble 

00:01:37.720 --> 00:01:51.610
 behaving with the hands doing 

00:01:43.250 --> 00:01:51.610
 be careful to eliminate any 

00:01:52.040 --> 00:01:56.630
 try to level without holes 

00:01:54.560 --> 00:01:59.830
 involve a little start off creating a 

00:01:56.630 --> 00:02:04.430
 2 cm high border add the ricotta 

00:01:59.830 --> 00:02:09.110
 and free ourselves by paying attention to 

00:02:04.430 --> 00:02:11.930
 remain one cm from the outer edge 

00:02:09.110 --> 00:02:16.030
 in this way it is time to 

00:02:11.930 --> 00:02:21.860
 add the chocolate drops only to 

00:02:16.030 --> 00:02:25.490
 look at it which is the will to cover the 

00:02:21.860 --> 00:02:29.420
 crumbled with the remaining dough mi 

00:02:25.490 --> 00:02:33.490
 I recommend without compacting it by doing yes 

00:02:29.420 --> 00:02:33.490
 that there are no holes 

00:02:35.490 --> 00:02:43.720
 previous this way 

00:02:39.269 --> 00:02:46.930
 unfortunately with one hand I resume and with 

00:02:43.720 --> 00:02:50.170
 the other tries to show you how 

00:02:46.930 --> 00:02:51.720
 proceed certain point need 

00:02:50.170 --> 00:02:56.170
 both hands 

00:02:51.720 --> 00:02:59.890
 so I leave you there for a moment 

00:02:56.170 --> 00:03:02.080
 we fight lightly with our hands not 

00:02:59.890 --> 00:03:04.079
 doing absolutely pressure 

00:03:02.080 --> 00:03:08.590
 otherwise we would no longer have the effect 

00:03:04.079 --> 00:03:14.590
 crumble on the way we put it in the oven 

00:03:08.590 --> 00:03:19.450
 preheated to 180 degrees 

00:03:14.590 --> 00:03:21.840
 let it cook for 40 minutes and 

00:03:19.450 --> 00:03:27.310
 here is this very special one 

00:03:21.840 --> 00:03:31.390
 crumbled ready to be served 

00:03:27.310 --> 00:03:36.610
 I recommend cutting it only when it is 

00:03:31.390 --> 00:03:40.150
 cold and send it with the fork from 

00:03:36.610 --> 00:03:45.780
 wellness to all net I greet you and to the 

00:03:40.150 --> 00:03:45.780
 next robbery recipe
