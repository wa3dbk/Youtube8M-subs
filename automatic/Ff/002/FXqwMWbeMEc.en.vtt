00:00:11.770 --> 00:00:15.440
 so today we will talk about my 

00:00:13.790 --> 00:00:18.260
 first order on the site névés 

00:00:15.440 --> 00:00:19.820
 cosmetics it's been a long time since I 

00:00:18.260 --> 00:00:20.900
 spoke especially by a robin nor 

00:00:19.820 --> 00:00:23.119
 will crack who had placed an order 

00:00:20.900 --> 00:00:25.100
 at home but hey I ordered the most 

00:00:23.119 --> 00:00:27.560
 important is there and I cracked for a 

00:00:25.100 --> 00:00:29.180
 lipstick and there are two bastions 

00:00:27.560 --> 00:00:31.400
 for the lips past hello for the eyes 

00:00:29.180 --> 00:00:33.170
 I had ordered something else too with 

00:00:31.400 --> 00:00:34.550
 but it's a surprise for someone 

00:00:33.170 --> 00:00:36.470
 so suddenly, well, I can not tell you 

00:00:34.550 --> 00:00:38.449
 will not show I received my package very 

00:00:36.470 --> 00:00:40.820
 quickly finally relatively quickly 

00:00:38.449 --> 00:00:42.500
 for a relay package shipment 

00:00:40.820 --> 00:00:43.370
 if you are adept at this kind of me 

00:00:42.500 --> 00:00:45.020
 you know it's still a small 

00:00:43.370 --> 00:00:46.730
 little longer than the post office when the 

00:00:45.020 --> 00:00:47.030
 post and is determined to send you 

00:00:46.730 --> 00:00:48.230
 parcel 

00:00:47.030 --> 00:00:49.700
 because from what I understood 

00:00:48.230 --> 00:00:51.320
 some girlfriends sent me 

00:00:49.700 --> 00:00:54.710
 parcels and I still do not have that while 

00:00:51.320 --> 00:00:56.480

00:00:56.480 --> 00:00:59.420
 parcels where he had written roughly a sword 

00:00:58.070 --> 00:01:01.910
 cosmetics on it and it's something that 

00:00:59.420 --> 00:01:03.620
 I do not like it at all because the guy has 

00:01:01.910 --> 00:01:04.759
 decided to stitch you in parcel and ben he 

00:01:03.620 --> 00:01:05.899
 can easily because he knows he 

00:01:04.759 --> 00:01:08.270
 are cosmetics in it I find that 

00:01:05.899 --> 00:01:09.979
 con the companies that put the name 

00:01:08.270 --> 00:01:14.479

00:02:33.670 --> 00:02:38.500
 of use of the armed cup line that I 

00:02:35.620 --> 00:02:39.790

00:02:38.500 --> 00:02:41.200
 explain for example the application of the 

00:02:39.790 --> 00:02:42.879

 the application of the mineral corrector and 

00:02:47.620 --> 00:02:52.930
 the application stems from the colors 

00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:53.290
 multifunctional is nice but good 

00:02:52.930 --> 00:02:54.790
