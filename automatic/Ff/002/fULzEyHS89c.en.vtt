00:00:02.810 --> 00:00:07.710
 the tv news presented at cs de las 

00:00:05.549 --> 00:00:09.660
 vegas for this 2015 edition are doing their 

00:00:07.710 --> 00:00:11.400
 show and above all we took it full 

00:00:09.660 --> 00:00:14.990
 the ultra high definition jérôme eyes 

00:00:11.400 --> 00:00:17.670
 4k oled super ultra high definition 

00:00:14.990 --> 00:00:19.800
 but like all the dots do not throw more 

00:00:17.670 --> 00:00:20.939
 how to choose from all these products 

00:00:19.800 --> 00:00:21.480
 high-end that will arrive 

00:00:20.939 --> 00:00:22.890
 shortly 

00:00:21.480 --> 00:00:25.080
 well we see that right away with 

00:00:22.890 --> 00:00:27.830
 our tv specialist or labs 01net 

00:00:25.080 --> 00:00:27.830
 bruno cormier 

00:00:30.260 --> 00:00:35.840
 we are all in ultra hd lolette was 

00:00:32.850 --> 00:00:38.579
 badly lg some manufacturers 

00:00:35.840 --> 00:00:41.329
 present a tele oled under their 

00:00:38.579 --> 00:00:44.040
 brand but in fact it's a slab lg 

00:00:41.329 --> 00:00:45.329
 but lg puts the package on the led 

00:00:44.040 --> 00:00:48.600
 why because it's totally 

00:00:45.329 --> 00:00:50.879
 magic as technology and yes a 

00:00:48.600 --> 00:00:53.039
 contract I need colors 

00:00:50.879 --> 00:00:55.469
 really he's going there they want to enjoy to 

00:00:53.039 --> 00:00:57.090
 dead of their advance especially on 

00:00:55.469 --> 00:00:59.910
 samsung since samsung tried the summer 

00:00:57.090 --> 00:01:01.440
 the oled and finally he continues on 

00:00:59.910 --> 00:01:03.930
 she already knows it's a little amazing 

00:01:01.440 --> 00:01:05.939
 lg samsung do not do the same thing 

00:01:03.930 --> 00:01:07.530
 for once yes fred exact choose 

00:01:05.939 --> 00:01:12.120
 two completely different directions 

00:01:07.530 --> 00:01:15.780
 is then stopped samsung practice the oled 

00:01:12.120 --> 00:01:17.490
 in his smartphones but they do not have 

00:01:15.780 --> 00:01:19.140
 had small size of apparently they 

00:01:17.490 --> 00:01:22.320
 have not decided to do help for 

00:01:19.140 --> 00:01:23.790
 TVs especially because their 

00:01:22.320 --> 00:01:25.380
 oled technology that is good 

00:01:23.790 --> 00:01:27.360
 particular different from that of lg 

00:01:25.380 --> 00:01:28.560
 may be a little less easy to 

00:01:27.360 --> 00:01:30.080
 implement at the level of the very 

00:01:28.560 --> 00:01:32.490
 large screens 

00:01:30.080 --> 00:01:34.020
 it's more expensive and why it's more 

00:01:32.490 --> 00:01:35.850
 expensive since there is very little sinn which 

00:01:34.020 --> 00:01:37.610
 so necessarily produce less there is 

00:01:35.850 --> 00:01:40.080
 Production volumes of the more expensive 

00:01:37.610 --> 00:01:41.310
 at lg it's different we're a 

00:01:40.080 --> 00:01:43.800
 oled technology which is still 

00:01:41.310 --> 00:01:46.520
 today is enough that 

00:01:43.800 --> 00:01:48.780
 white organic deadline letters 

00:01:46.520 --> 00:01:51.240
 so it's easier with so 

00:01:48.780 --> 00:01:52.500
 prisms of colors in front so that's 

00:01:51.240 --> 00:01:54.660
 easier for them to produce 

00:01:52.500 --> 00:01:55.380
 oled TV is a rather good choice 

00:01:54.660 --> 00:01:57.060
 technological 

00:01:55.380 --> 00:01:58.800
 now they are getting really good 

00:01:57.060 --> 00:02:00.690
 do things an area that we have 

00:01:58.800 --> 00:02:04.370
 explained recently that he was coming 

00:02:00.690 --> 00:02:06.120
 really to make TVs the oled 

00:02:04.370 --> 00:02:07.710
 relatively easily you have a 

00:02:06.120 --> 00:02:08.280
 new process to deposit LEDs 

00:02:07.710 --> 00:02:10.340
 organic 

00:02:08.280 --> 00:02:12.800
 that's without too much waste in the halls 

00:02:10.340 --> 00:02:14.880
 with a good performance that's exactly 

00:02:12.800 --> 00:02:18.209
 who was even able to recover 

00:02:14.880 --> 00:02:21.200
 slabs half failed so it was 

00:02:18.209 --> 00:02:23.520
 rather business it will not be my tv 

00:02:21.200 --> 00:02:25.050
 samsung here is not left out they have 

00:02:23.520 --> 00:02:29.790
 developed also something then in 

00:02:25.050 --> 00:02:31.830
 face we have the s usd then the shd we get 

00:02:29.790 --> 00:02:35.880
 understand well this is an appellation 

00:02:31.830 --> 00:02:37.560
 samsung marketing to designate the 

00:02:35.880 --> 00:02:38.880
 Meeting both technologies in 

00:02:37.560 --> 00:02:41.340
 teeth the lcd tvs 

00:02:38.880 --> 00:02:42.600
 so there is technology corner all me 

00:02:41.340 --> 00:02:44.250
 give what's called the quantum dots 

00:02:42.600 --> 00:02:46.410
 so it's quantum filters it's 

00:02:44.250 --> 00:02:47.750
 extremely complicated to explain because 

00:02:46.410 --> 00:02:49.860
 that it would be so at the level of the atoms 

00:02:47.750 --> 00:02:51.450
 but which actually allow to display 

00:02:49.860 --> 00:02:54.600
 much wider colors so 

00:02:51.450 --> 00:02:57.150
 especially reds and greens very 

00:02:54.600 --> 00:02:59.100
 saturated extremely red especially towards 

00:02:57.150 --> 00:03:00.150
 illustrations sees the lacetti clown 

00:02:59.100 --> 00:03:01.950
 that's fine for the program of 

00:03:00.150 --> 00:03:03.900
 frogs that's exactly it is that 

00:03:01.950 --> 00:03:05.970
 it was you jérôme bellay pardon them 

00:03:03.900 --> 00:03:08.489
 two red eyes like that it's typical 

00:03:05.970 --> 00:03:12.900
 of the use of the quantum of hague and 

00:03:08.489 --> 00:03:14.380
 even for the red this technology 

00:03:12.900 --> 00:03:16.570
 reds 

00:03:14.380 --> 00:03:17.680
 still goes further in the reds than 

00:03:16.570 --> 00:03:21.790
 oled ah yes 

00:03:17.680 --> 00:03:23.290
 so that's a benefit the quantum dots 

00:03:21.790 --> 00:03:26.170
 currently on the lcd can display 

00:03:23.290 --> 00:03:28.020
 more colors than the good led it will be 

00:03:26.170 --> 00:03:29.590
 that lol led lg 

00:03:28.020 --> 00:03:31.900
 so that means because today 

00:03:29.590 --> 00:03:33.280
 we will finally find ourselves for this 

00:03:31.900 --> 00:03:35.800
 2015 year with two technologies 

00:03:33.280 --> 00:03:40.090
 then on one side the oled 4k glazed d 

00:03:35.800 --> 00:03:42.190
 epuis this superb snatch choose 

00:03:40.090 --> 00:03:44.470
 that's so great the ultra hd actually 

00:03:42.190 --> 00:03:46.540
 so it's this ability to display 

00:03:44.470 --> 00:03:47.800
 a lot of colors the very far 

00:03:46.540 --> 00:03:51.010
 in the reds and greens and this 

00:03:47.800 --> 00:03:51.700
 ability to be able to view from a 

00:03:51.010 --> 00:03:53.440
 brightness 

00:03:51.700 --> 00:03:55.540
 good otherwise it's not three times 

00:03:53.440 --> 00:03:58.210
 superior so to actually have some 

00:03:55.540 --> 00:03:59.740
 pretty dazzling images with blacks 

00:03:58.210 --> 00:04:03.640
 very deep so with very big 

00:03:59.740 --> 00:04:04.450
 good contrast ratio while this 

00:04:03.640 --> 00:04:07.030
 need 

00:04:04.450 --> 00:04:08.890
 that's it requires it's her and 

00:04:07.030 --> 00:04:11.050
 require very bright backlighting 

00:04:08.890 --> 00:04:15.130
 perfected which is very expensive so 

00:04:11.050 --> 00:04:18.340
 in fact between the 2015 oled and the suv 

00:04:15.130 --> 00:04:19.960
 hd 2015 very high end lcd 

00:04:18.340 --> 00:04:21.430
 prices are going to be pretty much similar 

00:04:19.960 --> 00:04:23.110
 ah good because samsung did not tell us 

00:04:21.430 --> 00:04:25.120
 that yes but it was going to cost less 

00:04:23.110 --> 00:04:26.890
 that that oled I think the very high 

00:04:25.120 --> 00:04:30.550
 range is able to add once more 

00:04:26.890 --> 00:04:31.870
 so he's doing a lot of stuff I think 

00:04:30.550 --> 00:04:34.720
 I think the very high end and 

00:04:31.870 --> 00:04:36.460
 follows hd will not necessarily be cheaper 

00:04:34.720 --> 00:04:38.820
 to equal sizes however they will be 

00:04:36.460 --> 00:04:41.620
 able to mount ensures retail 

00:04:38.820 --> 00:04:43.810
 superior ie 80 85 inches if 

00:04:41.620 --> 00:04:47.590
 need but will be very expensive too 

00:04:43.810 --> 00:04:50.560
 so good short we'll see the prices but 

00:04:47.590 --> 00:04:52.030
 however, we can choose the 

00:04:50.560 --> 00:04:54.340
 technologies are roughly equivalent 

00:04:52.030 --> 00:04:55.810
 except that the oled at the rates of 

00:04:54.340 --> 00:04:59.080
 contrast and black is largely 

00:04:55.810 --> 00:05:00.610
 higher still so the oled of course 

00:04:59.080 --> 00:05:03.490
 that chooses the LED since the fission 

00:05:00.610 --> 00:05:05.290
 helmand visualizing addicted beyond the 

00:05:03.490 --> 00:05:07.030
 technology beyond technology and 

00:05:05.290 --> 00:05:10.540
 numbers for the led it's just 

00:05:07.030 --> 00:05:12.070
 magical that's it changes the perception of 

00:05:10.540 --> 00:05:14.110
 the image perception of colors is 

00:05:12.070 --> 00:05:16.330
 just grandiose even the summer the oled 

00:05:14.110 --> 00:05:18.249
 today are far superior 

00:05:16.330 --> 00:05:20.169
 and even lcd 

00:05:18.249 --> 00:05:21.339
 the oled in full hd sometimes are more 

00:05:20.169 --> 00:05:22.569
 impressive that some yielded in 

00:05:21.339 --> 00:05:25.389
 four quarters that's what is 

00:05:22.569 --> 00:05:26.739
 exactly good bruno perfect thanks but 

00:05:25.389 --> 00:05:28.809
 we are going to buy two, so maybe 

00:05:26.739 --> 00:05:30.009
 we will have a price no I had all 

00:05:28.809 --> 00:05:31.269
 wait for it to drop especially yes 

00:05:30.009 --> 00:05:34.239
 because it's going to be very expensive 

00:05:31.269 --> 00:05:36.219
 remember that the price of the tdlg 4 call 

00:05:34.239 --> 00:05:37.509
 oled it's ten thousand euros 

00:05:36.219 --> 00:05:39.039
 that's ten thousand euros for the big 

00:05:37.509 --> 00:05:41.379
 and the winds of 60 and big size so 

00:05:39.039 --> 00:05:44.609
 it will have to start anyway 

00:05:41.379 --> 00:05:44.609
 save now
