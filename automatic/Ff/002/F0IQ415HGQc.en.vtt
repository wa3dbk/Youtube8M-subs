now just compare this to the size of a

00:00:35.670 --> 00:00:37.430 
now just compare this to the size of a
regular<00:00:35.820> minifigure<00:00:36.450> right<00:00:37.050> here<00:00:37.230> I<00:00:37.260> got

00:00:37.430 --> 00:00:37.440 
regular minifigure right here I got

right there which uses those modified

00:01:10.229 --> 00:01:11.990 
right there which uses those modified
circular<00:01:10.710> tile<00:01:10.950> pieces<00:01:11.220> with<00:01:11.460> a<00:01:11.490> little<00:01:11.790> hole

00:01:13.730 --> 00:01:13.740 
in the middle so that comes out very

00:01:13.740 --> 00:01:15.440 
in the middle so that comes out very
well<00:01:13.860> you<00:01:14.130> could<00:01:14.250> even<00:01:14.369> take<00:01:14.610> off<00:01:14.820> the<00:01:15.270> face

00:01:15.440 --> 00:01:15.450 
well you could even take off the face

00:01:15.450 --> 00:01:17.210 
well you could even take off the face
quite<00:01:15.780> easily<00:01:15.990> but<00:01:16.320> I'm<00:01:16.470> not<00:01:16.650> sure<00:01:16.920> why<00:01:17.070> you'd

00:01:17.210 --> 00:01:17.220 
quite easily but I'm not sure why you'd

00:01:17.220 --> 00:01:19.039 
quite easily but I'm not sure why you'd
like<00:01:17.400> to<00:01:17.549> do<00:01:17.640> that<00:01:17.670> and<00:01:18.450> you<00:01:18.570> can<00:01:18.689> just<00:01:18.840> kind<00:01:18.990> of

00:01:19.039 --> 00:01:19.049 
like to do that and you can just kind of

00:01:19.049 --> 00:01:22.280 
like to do that and you can just kind of
easily<00:01:19.439> reattach<00:01:20.130> it<00:01:20.280> like<00:01:20.880> that<00:01:21.090> and<00:01:21.450> his

00:01:22.280 --> 00:01:22.290 
easily reattach it like that and his

00:01:22.290 --> 00:01:25.010 
easily reattach it like that and his
ears<00:01:22.710> right<00:01:23.340> here<00:01:23.729> actually<00:01:24.240> are<00:01:24.450> on<00:01:24.810> these

00:01:25.010 --> 00:01:25.020 
ears right here actually are on these

00:01:25.020 --> 00:01:26.450 
ears right here actually are on these
many<00:01:25.259> ball<00:01:25.470> joints<00:01:25.770> so<00:01:25.890> you<00:01:25.920> could<00:01:26.189> put<00:01:26.340> them

00:01:26.450 --> 00:01:26.460 
many ball joints so you could put them

00:01:26.460 --> 00:01:28.249 
many ball joints so you could put them
in<00:01:26.610> different<00:01:26.729> directions<00:01:26.909> if<00:01:27.509> you'd<00:01:27.720> like<00:01:27.930> so

00:01:28.249 --> 00:01:28.259 
in different directions if you'd like so

00:01:28.259 --> 00:01:29.749 
in different directions if you'd like so
that's<00:01:28.710> really<00:01:28.920> fun<00:01:29.009> to<00:01:29.189> play<00:01:29.369> with<00:01:29.490> the<00:01:29.579> face

00:01:29.749 --> 00:01:29.759 
that's really fun to play with the face

00:01:29.759 --> 00:01:31.910 
that's really fun to play with the face
now<00:01:30.360> like<00:01:30.540> I<00:01:30.630> said<00:01:30.840> there's<00:01:30.990> a<00:01:31.079> great<00:01:31.470> kind<00:01:31.860> of

00:01:31.910 --> 00:01:31.920 
now like I said there's a great kind of

00:01:31.920 --> 00:01:33.830 
now like I said there's a great kind of
design<00:01:32.189> with<00:01:32.640> this<00:01:32.850> whole<00:01:33.030> thing<00:01:33.270> all<00:01:33.509> around

00:01:33.830 --> 00:01:33.840 
design with this whole thing all around

00:01:33.840 --> 00:01:35.270 
design with this whole thing all around
because<00:01:34.020> they<00:01:34.590> use<00:01:34.770> a<00:01:34.799> lot<00:01:35.100> of<00:01:35.130> different

00:01:35.270 --> 00:01:35.280 
because they use a lot of different

00:01:35.280 --> 00:01:37.819 
because they use a lot of different
layers<00:01:35.670> of<00:01:35.790> these<00:01:36.150> big<00:01:36.450> solid<00:01:36.900> bricks<00:01:37.229> to<00:01:37.650> give

00:01:37.819 --> 00:01:37.829 
layers of these big solid bricks to give

00:01:37.829 --> 00:01:40.399 
layers of these big solid bricks to give
it<00:01:37.950> that<00:01:38.220> nice<00:01:38.520> kind<00:01:39.000> of<00:01:39.090> rounded<00:01:39.750> look<00:01:39.930> to<00:01:40.229> it

00:01:40.399 --> 00:01:40.409 
it that nice kind of rounded look to it

00:01:40.409 --> 00:01:43.310 
it that nice kind of rounded look to it
now<00:01:41.220> the<00:01:41.549> main<00:01:41.729> function<00:01:42.329> of<00:01:42.450> the<00:01:42.869> piggy<00:01:43.079> coin

00:01:43.310 --> 00:01:43.320 
now the main function of the piggy coin

00:01:43.320 --> 00:01:46.490 
now the main function of the piggy coin
Bank<00:01:43.649> works<00:01:44.520> quite<00:01:45.060> well<00:01:45.090> it's<00:01:45.750> not<00:01:45.899> perfect

00:01:46.490 --> 00:01:46.500 
Bank works quite well it's not perfect

00:01:46.500 --> 00:01:48.859 
Bank works quite well it's not perfect
but<00:01:46.770> I<00:01:47.070> just<00:01:47.610> have<00:01:47.729> this<00:01:47.880> regular<00:01:48.329> American

00:01:48.859 --> 00:01:48.869 
but I just have this regular American

00:01:48.869 --> 00:01:51.080 
but I just have this regular American
Quarter<00:01:49.200> right<00:01:49.320> here<00:01:49.619> any<00:01:50.369> teachers<00:01:50.850> put<00:01:50.970> it

00:01:51.080 --> 00:01:51.090 
Quarter right here any teachers put it

00:01:51.090 --> 00:01:52.550 
Quarter right here any teachers put it
in<00:01:51.149> there<00:01:51.299> and<00:01:51.509> bam<00:01:51.720> I<00:01:51.960> mean<00:01:52.140> it<00:01:52.229> could<00:01:52.320> fit<00:01:52.530> for

00:01:52.550 --> 00:01:52.560 
in there and bam I mean it could fit for

00:01:52.560 --> 00:01:54.560 
in there and bam I mean it could fit for
American<00:01:53.430> coins<00:01:53.700> I'm<00:01:53.880> pretty<00:01:54.240> sure<00:01:54.390> I<00:01:54.420> could

00:01:54.560 --> 00:01:54.570 
American coins I'm pretty sure I could

00:01:54.570 --> 00:01:56.300 
American coins I'm pretty sure I could
fit<00:01:54.750> just<00:01:55.200> about<00:01:55.290> every<00:01:55.649> coin<00:01:55.799> out<00:01:56.040> there

00:01:56.300 --> 00:01:56.310 
fit just about every coin out there

00:01:56.310 --> 00:01:58.429 
fit just about every coin out there
because<00:01:56.430> um<00:01:56.759> I<00:01:57.030> know<00:01:57.299> it<00:01:57.420> could<00:01:57.540> fit<00:01:57.689> half<00:01:57.990> $1

00:01:58.429 --> 00:01:58.439 
because um I know it could fit half $1

00:01:58.439 --> 00:02:00.859 
because um I know it could fit half $1
so<00:01:58.799> that's<00:01:59.009> really<00:01:59.159> cool<00:01:59.430> but<00:02:00.090> you<00:02:00.479> got<00:02:00.630> a<00:02:00.659> lot

00:02:00.859 --> 00:02:00.869 
so that's really cool but you got a lot

00:02:00.869 --> 00:02:02.270 
so that's really cool but you got a lot
of<00:02:00.899> room<00:02:01.200> inside<00:02:01.350> there<00:02:01.740> but<00:02:01.920> my<00:02:02.040> main

00:02:02.270 --> 00:02:02.280 
of room inside there but my main

00:02:02.280 --> 00:02:04.340 
of room inside there but my main
complaint<00:02:02.759> was<00:02:02.909> this<00:02:03.090> is<00:02:03.420> it's<00:02:03.869> kind<00:02:04.079> of<00:02:04.140> hard

00:02:04.340 --> 00:02:04.350 
complaint was this is it's kind of hard

00:02:04.350 --> 00:02:05.810 
complaint was this is it's kind of hard
to<00:02:04.409> open<00:02:04.799> this<00:02:04.920> there's<00:02:05.159> no<00:02:05.310> easy<00:02:05.579> way<00:02:05.790> to

00:02:05.810 --> 00:02:05.820 
to open this there's no easy way to

00:02:05.820 --> 00:02:08.150 
to open this there's no easy way to
remove<00:02:06.180> the<00:02:06.299> top<00:02:06.509> now<00:02:07.170> you<00:02:07.229> may<00:02:07.439> think<00:02:07.469> this<00:02:07.920> is

00:02:08.150 --> 00:02:08.160 
remove the top now you may think this is

00:02:08.160 --> 00:02:10.550 
remove the top now you may think this is
more<00:02:09.090> of<00:02:09.149> the<00:02:09.239> traditional<00:02:09.390> piggy<00:02:10.050> coin<00:02:10.289> Bank

00:02:10.550 --> 00:02:10.560 
more of the traditional piggy coin Bank

00:02:10.560 --> 00:02:12.080 
more of the traditional piggy coin Bank
style<00:02:10.920> because<00:02:11.220> back

00:02:12.080 --> 00:02:12.090 
style because back

00:02:12.090 --> 00:02:14.120 
style because back
the<00:02:12.270> older<00:02:12.750> ones<00:02:12.959> not<00:02:13.200> really<00:02:13.560> from<00:02:13.709> Lego<00:02:13.890> but

00:02:14.120 --> 00:02:14.130 
the older ones not really from Lego but

00:02:14.130 --> 00:02:16.130 
the older ones not really from Lego but
just<00:02:14.430> in<00:02:14.580> general<00:02:14.610> piggy<00:02:15.300> coin<00:02:15.510> banks<00:02:15.810> you

00:02:16.130 --> 00:02:16.140 
just in general piggy coin banks you

00:02:16.140 --> 00:02:17.630 
just in general piggy coin banks you
would<00:02:16.230> have<00:02:16.380> to<00:02:16.470> open<00:02:16.620> them<00:02:16.890> by<00:02:17.010> smashing<00:02:17.520> them

00:02:17.630 --> 00:02:17.640 
would have to open them by smashing them

00:02:17.640 --> 00:02:19.880 
would have to open them by smashing them
on<00:02:17.760> the<00:02:17.849> floor<00:02:18.060> so<00:02:18.360> it's<00:02:19.110> not<00:02:19.260> that<00:02:19.319> hard<00:02:19.590> to

00:02:19.880 --> 00:02:19.890 
on the floor so it's not that hard to

00:02:19.890 --> 00:02:21.589 
on the floor so it's not that hard to
open<00:02:20.250> it<00:02:20.340> because<00:02:20.610> um<00:02:20.940> you<00:02:21.270> know<00:02:21.360> you<00:02:21.420> just

00:02:21.589 --> 00:02:21.599 
open it because um you know you just

00:02:21.599 --> 00:02:22.790 
open it because um you know you just
have<00:02:21.750> to<00:02:21.810> remove<00:02:21.989> these<00:02:22.140> little<00:02:22.410> layers<00:02:22.620> of

00:02:22.790 --> 00:02:22.800 
have to remove these little layers of

00:02:22.800 --> 00:02:24.320 
have to remove these little layers of
bricks<00:02:23.040> I<00:02:23.310> wish<00:02:23.700> it<00:02:23.819> would<00:02:23.910> have<00:02:24.000> been<00:02:24.090> maybe<00:02:24.209> a

00:02:24.320 --> 00:02:24.330 
bricks I wish it would have been maybe a

00:02:24.330 --> 00:02:26.360 
bricks I wish it would have been maybe a
plate<00:02:24.599> that<00:02:24.630> easily<00:02:25.170> lifts<00:02:25.500> off<00:02:25.709> but<00:02:26.310> you

00:02:26.360 --> 00:02:26.370 
plate that easily lifts off but you

00:02:26.370 --> 00:02:27.830 
plate that easily lifts off but you
could<00:02:26.489> see<00:02:26.610> you<00:02:26.700> could<00:02:26.790> fit<00:02:27.030> quite<00:02:27.300> a<00:02:27.390> lot<00:02:27.720> of

00:02:27.830 --> 00:02:27.840 
could see you could fit quite a lot of

00:02:27.840 --> 00:02:29.660 
could see you could fit quite a lot of
coins<00:02:28.110> in<00:02:28.349> there<00:02:28.680> so<00:02:28.890> that<00:02:29.310> works<00:02:29.489> out<00:02:29.640> very

00:02:29.660 --> 00:02:29.670 
coins in there so that works out very

00:02:29.670 --> 00:02:32.360 
coins in there so that works out very
very<00:02:30.030> well<00:02:30.380> there's<00:02:31.380> not<00:02:31.470> much<00:02:31.530> else<00:02:31.920> inside

00:02:32.360 --> 00:02:32.370 
very well there's not much else inside

00:02:32.370 --> 00:02:33.830 
very well there's not much else inside
there<00:02:32.610> though<00:02:32.790> but<00:02:33.060> of<00:02:33.300> course<00:02:33.569> there's

00:02:33.830 --> 00:02:33.840 
there though but of course there's

00:02:33.840 --> 00:02:36.650 
there though but of course there's
necessary<00:02:34.739> room<00:02:34.950> for<00:02:35.280> more<00:02:35.819> coins<00:02:36.150> than<00:02:36.330> just

00:02:36.650 --> 00:02:36.660 
necessary room for more coins than just

00:02:36.660 --> 00:02:40.070 
necessary room for more coins than just
this<00:02:36.810> one<00:02:37.019> that<00:02:37.170> I<00:02:37.230> put<00:02:37.440> in<00:02:37.530> there<00:02:37.680> now<00:02:39.080> looking

00:02:40.070 --> 00:02:40.080 
this one that I put in there now looking

00:02:40.080 --> 00:02:41.900 
this one that I put in there now looking
at<00:02:40.170> the<00:02:40.319> back<00:02:40.530> or<00:02:40.950> we<00:02:41.250> can<00:02:41.400> just<00:02:41.550> easily

00:02:41.900 --> 00:02:41.910 
at the back or we can just easily

00:02:41.910 --> 00:02:43.339 
at the back or we can just easily
reapply<00:02:42.269> like<00:02:42.450> that<00:02:42.630> but<00:02:42.930> looking<00:02:43.170> at<00:02:43.260> the

00:02:43.339 --> 00:02:43.349 
reapply like that but looking at the

00:02:43.349 --> 00:02:45.530 
reapply like that but looking at the
back<00:02:43.530> they<00:02:44.100> have<00:02:44.250> this<00:02:44.400> nice<00:02:44.640> corkscrew<00:02:45.269> tail

00:02:45.530 --> 00:02:45.540 
back they have this nice corkscrew tail

00:02:45.540 --> 00:02:47.960 
back they have this nice corkscrew tail
which<00:02:45.870> they<00:02:46.049> used<00:02:46.290> some<00:02:46.890> Technic<00:02:47.310> pieces<00:02:47.549> for

00:02:47.960 --> 00:02:47.970 
which they used some Technic pieces for

00:02:47.970 --> 00:02:49.940 
which they used some Technic pieces for
and<00:02:48.239> I<00:02:48.510> think<00:02:48.870> that<00:02:48.989> works<00:02:49.140> pretty<00:02:49.260> well<00:02:49.380> it's

00:02:49.940 --> 00:02:49.950 
and I think that works pretty well it's

00:02:49.950 --> 00:02:51.620 
and I think that works pretty well it's
all<00:02:50.130> swiveling<00:02:50.549> just<00:02:50.790> on<00:02:50.910> this<00:02:51.000> one<00:02:51.060> Technic

00:02:51.620 --> 00:02:51.630 
all swiveling just on this one Technic

00:02:51.630 --> 00:02:53.600 
all swiveling just on this one Technic
pin<00:02:51.810> or<00:02:52.319> the<00:02:52.470> modified<00:02:53.069> brick<00:02:53.340> with<00:02:53.519> the

00:02:53.600 --> 00:02:53.610 
pin or the modified brick with the

00:02:53.610 --> 00:02:55.850 
pin or the modified brick with the
Technic<00:02:53.940> pins<00:02:54.120> sticking<00:02:54.420> out<00:02:54.569> but<00:02:55.230> it<00:02:55.650> gives

00:02:55.850 --> 00:02:55.860 
Technic pins sticking out but it gives

00:02:55.860 --> 00:02:58.130 
Technic pins sticking out but it gives
it<00:02:55.950> a<00:02:56.069> nice<00:02:56.250> authentic<00:02:56.910> look<00:02:57.209> and<00:02:57.450> it's<00:02:57.900> a<00:02:57.959> very

00:02:58.130 --> 00:02:58.140 
it a nice authentic look and it's a very

00:02:58.140 --> 00:03:00.080 
it a nice authentic look and it's a very
simple<00:02:58.410> look<00:02:58.739> so<00:02:58.950> I<00:02:59.190> like<00:02:59.549> how<00:02:59.670> that<00:02:59.730> came<00:02:59.940> out

00:03:00.080 --> 00:03:00.090 
simple look so I like how that came out

00:03:00.090 --> 00:03:02.539 
simple look so I like how that came out
very<00:03:00.120> creative<00:03:00.810> and<00:03:01.170> on<00:03:01.440> the<00:03:01.530> bottom<00:03:01.890> you<00:03:02.250> even

00:03:02.539 --> 00:03:02.549 
very creative and on the bottom you even

00:03:02.549 --> 00:03:04.789 
very creative and on the bottom you even
got<00:03:02.700> these<00:03:02.849> little<00:03:03.030> circular<00:03:03.750> bricks<00:03:04.650> right

00:03:04.789 --> 00:03:04.799 
got these little circular bricks right

00:03:04.799 --> 00:03:07.550 
got these little circular bricks right
here<00:03:05.099> which<00:03:05.910> are<00:03:06.209> actually<00:03:06.360> used<00:03:06.810> for<00:03:07.380> his

00:03:07.550 --> 00:03:07.560 
here which are actually used for his

00:03:07.560 --> 00:03:09.140 
here which are actually used for his
little<00:03:07.890> legs<00:03:08.130> and<00:03:08.459> I<00:03:08.519> think<00:03:08.700> that<00:03:08.819> worked<00:03:09.030> out

00:03:09.140 --> 00:03:09.150 
little legs and I think that worked out

00:03:09.150 --> 00:03:11.870 
little legs and I think that worked out
very<00:03:09.180> very<00:03:09.660> well<00:03:09.959> very<00:03:10.410> clever<00:03:10.769> very<00:03:11.069> stable

00:03:11.870 --> 00:03:11.880 
very very well very clever very stable

00:03:11.880 --> 00:03:15.740 
very very well very clever very stable
and<00:03:12.690> it<00:03:12.989> just<00:03:13.470> stands<00:03:13.739> up<00:03:13.890> very<00:03:14.489> very<00:03:14.970> cool<00:03:15.209> so

00:03:15.740 --> 00:03:15.750 
and it just stands up very very cool so

00:03:15.750 --> 00:03:17.360 
and it just stands up very very cool so
that's<00:03:16.109> really<00:03:16.290> it<00:03:16.560> I<00:03:16.799> would<00:03:17.010> have<00:03:17.100> prefered

00:03:17.360 --> 00:03:17.370 
that's really it I would have prefered

00:03:17.370 --> 00:03:18.680 
that's really it I would have prefered
maybe<00:03:17.579> if<00:03:17.760> they<00:03:17.880> had<00:03:17.910> an<00:03:18.150> opening<00:03:18.510> on<00:03:18.630> the

00:03:18.680 --> 00:03:18.690 
maybe if they had an opening on the

00:03:18.690 --> 00:03:19.940 
maybe if they had an opening on the
bottom<00:03:18.989> or<00:03:19.109> something<00:03:19.350> like<00:03:19.440> that<00:03:19.560> to<00:03:19.680> easily

00:03:19.940 --> 00:03:19.950 
bottom or something like that to easily

00:03:19.950 --> 00:03:22.550 
bottom or something like that to easily
remove<00:03:20.160> coins<00:03:20.430> but<00:03:21.000> for<00:03:21.390> the<00:03:21.510> good<00:03:21.870> price<00:03:22.290> it

00:03:22.550 --> 00:03:22.560 
remove coins but for the good price it

00:03:22.560 --> 00:03:24.830

has<00:03:22.680> a<00:03:22.739> $15.00<00:03:23.310> price<00:03:23.579> point<00:03:23.880> you<00:03:24.720> know<00:03:24.810> I

00:03:26.720 --> 00:03:26.730 
really think they executed this very

00:03:26.730 --> 00:03:28.309 
really think they executed this very
well<00:03:26.940> so<00:03:27.180> we'll<00:03:27.390> take<00:03:27.510> a<00:03:27.569> look<00:03:27.720> at<00:03:27.810> box<00:03:28.049> and

having that a traditional pink color but
I<00:04:00.989> think<00:04:01.260> the<00:04:01.319> red<00:04:01.470> looks<00:04:01.680> fine<00:04:01.889> and<00:04:02.190> it<00:04:02.670> also

00:04:02.809 --> 00:04:02.819 
I think the red looks fine and it also

I think the red looks fine and it also
has<00:04:03.000> a<00:04:03.030> great<00:04:03.269> function<00:04:03.690> of<00:04:03.780> storing<00:04:04.079> coins<00:04:04.350> my

has a great function of storing coins my
only<00:04:05.069> complaint<00:04:05.310> says<00:04:05.549> it's<00:04:05.700> a<00:04:05.760> little<00:04:05.970> bit

00:04:06.050 --> 00:04:06.060 
only complaint says it's a little bit

00:04:06.060 --> 00:04:08.629 
only complaint says it's a little bit
hard<00:04:06.269> to<00:04:06.329> remove<00:04:06.630> the<00:04:06.780> coins<00:04:07.049> and<00:04:07.410> also<00:04:08.340> the

00:04:08.629 --> 00:04:08.639 
hard to remove the coins and also the

00:04:08.639 --> 00:04:10.250 
hard to remove the coins and also the
building<00:04:09.209> for<00:04:09.450> it<00:04:09.569> was<00:04:09.750> a<00:04:09.780> little<00:04:10.079> bit

00:04:10.250 --> 00:04:10.260 
building for it was a little bit

00:04:10.260 --> 00:04:11.720 
building for it was a little bit
confusing<00:04:10.680> because<00:04:10.829> of<00:04:11.069> all<00:04:11.160> the<00:04:11.250> red<00:04:11.400> colors

00:04:11.720 --> 00:04:11.730 
confusing because of all the red colors

00:04:11.730 --> 00:04:13.430 
confusing because of all the red colors
but<00:04:12.209> I<00:04:12.239> like<00:04:12.510> that<00:04:12.660> they<00:04:12.780> include<00:04:13.079> a<00:04:13.170> lot<00:04:13.200> of

00:04:13.430 --> 00:04:13.440 
but I like that they include a lot of

00:04:13.440 --> 00:04:15.440 
but I like that they include a lot of
red<00:04:13.680> bricks<00:04:14.069> in<00:04:14.280> there<00:04:14.549> for<00:04:14.730> the<00:04:14.819> $50<00:04:15.239> price

00:04:15.440 --> 00:04:15.450 
red bricks in there for the $50 price

00:04:15.450 --> 00:04:17.330 
red bricks in there for the $50 price
point<00:04:15.720> and<00:04:15.900> I<00:04:16.289> will<00:04:16.500> give<00:04:16.680> this<00:04:16.799> set<00:04:17.010> an<00:04:17.160> a

00:04:17.330 --> 00:04:17.340 
point and I will give this set an a

00:04:17.340 --> 00:04:18.560 
point and I will give this set an a
because<00:04:17.669> it's<00:04:17.789> just<00:04:17.910> really<00:04:18.209> fun<00:04:18.389> to<00:04:18.419> play
