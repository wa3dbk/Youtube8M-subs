00:00:25.359 --> 00:00:28.050 

I<00:00:25.890> started<00:00:26.890> playing<00:00:27.220> Rickford<00:00:27.730> sticks

00:00:28.050 --> 00:00:28.060 
I started playing Rickford sticks

00:00:28.060 --> 00:00:31.349 
I started playing Rickford sticks
probably<00:00:28.539> about<00:00:29.050> 15<00:00:29.619> years<00:00:29.650> ago<00:00:30.009> I<00:00:30.490> didn't

00:00:31.349 --> 00:00:31.359 
probably about 15 years ago I didn't

00:00:31.359 --> 00:00:33.689 
probably about 15 years ago I didn't
really<00:00:31.630> think<00:00:31.779> much<00:00:32.050> about<00:00:32.199> sticks<00:00:33.100> at<00:00:33.430> that

00:00:33.689 --> 00:00:33.699 
really think much about sticks at that

00:00:33.699 --> 00:00:35.549 
really think much about sticks at that
point<00:00:34.030> I<00:00:34.120> just<00:00:34.360> like<00:00:34.570> how<00:00:34.809> these<00:00:35.019> feel<00:00:35.290> good<00:00:35.440> I

00:00:35.549 --> 00:00:35.559 
point I just like how these feel good I

00:00:35.559 --> 00:00:37.259 
point I just like how these feel good I
guess<00:00:35.800> you<00:00:35.980> know<00:00:36.100> and<00:00:36.430> whatever<00:00:36.670> would<00:00:37.000> last

00:00:37.259 --> 00:00:37.269 
guess you know and whatever would last

00:00:37.269 --> 00:00:39.689 
guess you know and whatever would last
me<00:00:37.540> the<00:00:37.570> longest<00:00:38.019> was<00:00:38.470> like<00:00:38.890> my<00:00:39.040> only<00:00:39.340> concern

00:00:39.689 --> 00:00:39.699 
me the longest was like my only concern

00:00:39.699 --> 00:00:51.020 
me the longest was like my only concern
back<00:00:39.970> then<00:00:40.210> pretty<00:00:40.570> much

00:00:51.020 --> 00:00:51.030 

00:00:51.030 --> 00:00:54.150 

I<00:00:52.030> probably<00:00:52.989> do<00:00:53.170> a<00:00:53.199> big<00:00:53.410> fried<00:00:53.620> making<00:00:53.949> this

00:00:54.150 --> 00:00:54.160 
I probably do a big fried making this

00:00:54.160 --> 00:00:54.750 
I probably do a big fried making this
stick

00:00:54.750 --> 00:00:54.760 
stick

00:00:54.760 --> 00:00:57.479 
stick
I<00:00:54.789> would<00:00:55.210> I<00:00:55.719> would<00:00:56.050> play<00:00:56.379> the<00:00:56.559> two<00:00:56.739> bees<00:00:56.949> they

00:00:57.479 --> 00:00:57.489 
I would I would play the two bees they

00:00:57.489 --> 00:01:00.209 
I would I would play the two bees they
were<00:00:57.820> like<00:00:58.000> my<00:00:58.149> sticker<00:00:58.420> choice<00:00:58.750> but<00:00:59.109> I<00:00:59.350> they

00:01:00.209 --> 00:01:00.219 
were like my sticker choice but I they

00:01:00.219 --> 00:01:03.149 
were like my sticker choice but I they
felt<00:01:00.489> a<00:01:00.640> little<00:01:00.820> just<00:01:01.420> a<00:01:01.539> tiny<00:01:01.839> bit<00:01:02.079> to<00:01:02.469> shorten

00:01:03.149 --> 00:01:03.159 
felt a little just a tiny bit to shorten

00:01:03.159 --> 00:01:06.240 
felt a little just a tiny bit to shorten
a<00:01:03.219> tiny<00:01:03.460> bit<00:01:03.670> to<00:01:03.909> too<00:01:04.570> thin<00:01:04.869> for<00:01:05.199> me<00:01:05.560> and<00:01:05.799> the

00:01:06.240 --> 00:01:06.250 
a tiny bit to too thin for me and the

00:01:06.250 --> 00:01:08.730 
a tiny bit to too thin for me and the
rock<00:01:06.430> stick<00:01:06.700> was<00:01:06.880> kind<00:01:07.090> of<00:01:07.180> a<00:01:07.509> bit<00:01:08.350> too<00:01:08.530> much

00:01:08.730 --> 00:01:08.740 
rock stick was kind of a bit too much

00:01:08.740 --> 00:01:10.410 
rock stick was kind of a bit too much
and<00:01:09.070> a<00:01:09.100> bit<00:01:09.280> too<00:01:09.460> long<00:01:09.640> and<00:01:09.880> a<00:01:09.909> bit<00:01:10.060> too<00:01:10.240> heavy

00:01:10.410 --> 00:01:10.420 
and a bit too long and a bit too heavy

00:01:10.420 --> 00:01:12.539 
and a bit too long and a bit too heavy
at<00:01:10.810> the<00:01:11.080> time<00:01:11.289> there<00:01:11.560> wasn't<00:01:11.770> like<00:01:12.039> really

00:01:12.539 --> 00:01:12.549 
at the time there wasn't like really

00:01:12.549 --> 00:01:13.980 
at the time there wasn't like really
something<00:01:13.030> that<00:01:13.149> was<00:01:13.270> right<00:01:13.690> in<00:01:13.840> between

00:01:13.980 --> 00:01:13.990 
something that was right in between

00:01:13.990 --> 00:01:16.980 
something that was right in between
those<00:01:14.350> two<00:01:14.590> sticks<00:01:14.920> and<00:01:15.220> and<00:01:15.630> when<00:01:16.630> I<00:01:16.659> had<00:01:16.840> the

00:01:16.980 --> 00:01:16.990 
those two sticks and and when I had the

00:01:16.990 --> 00:01:20.730 
those two sticks and and when I had the
opportunity<00:01:17.259> to<00:01:18.659> make<00:01:19.659> a<00:01:19.690> signature<00:01:20.140> stick<00:01:20.530> of

00:01:20.730 --> 00:01:20.740 
opportunity to make a signature stick of

00:01:20.740 --> 00:01:22.020 
opportunity to make a signature stick of
course<00:01:21.100> they<00:01:21.280> jumped<00:01:21.520> on<00:01:21.640> that<00:01:21.670> chance

00:01:22.020 --> 00:01:22.030 
course they jumped on that chance

00:01:22.030 --> 00:01:23.309 
course they jumped on that chance
because<00:01:22.149> I<00:01:22.330> was<00:01:22.539> really<00:01:22.840> looking<00:01:23.110> for

00:01:23.309 --> 00:01:23.319 
because I was really looking for

00:01:23.319 --> 00:01:27.930 
because I was really looking for
something<00:01:23.350> that<00:01:23.619> was<00:01:23.830> in-between<00:01:24.009> those<00:01:26.940> once

00:01:27.930 --> 00:01:27.940 
something that was in-between those once

00:01:27.940 --> 00:01:32.279 
something that was in-between those once
vic<00:01:28.210> firth<00:01:29.159> decided<00:01:30.159> to<00:01:30.720> do<00:01:31.720> this<00:01:31.929> signature

00:01:32.279 --> 00:01:32.289 
vic firth decided to do this signature

00:01:32.289 --> 00:01:35.160 
vic firth decided to do this signature
stick<00:01:32.649> for<00:01:32.920> me<00:01:33.069> they<00:01:34.060> were<00:01:34.119> even<00:01:34.539> more<00:01:34.690> adamant

00:01:35.160 --> 00:01:35.170 
stick for me they were even more adamant

00:01:35.170 --> 00:01:38.010 
stick for me they were even more adamant
than<00:01:35.350> than<00:01:35.619> me<00:01:35.860> that<00:01:36.130> that<00:01:36.429> he<00:01:36.549> had<00:01:36.759> to<00:01:36.940> be<00:01:37.090> the

00:01:38.010 --> 00:01:38.020 
than than me that that he had to be the

00:01:38.020 --> 00:01:40.109 
than than me that that he had to be the
perfect<00:01:38.470> stick<00:01:38.710> for<00:01:38.920> me<00:01:39.039> you<00:01:39.250> know<00:01:39.369> some<00:01:40.030> of

00:01:40.109 --> 00:01:40.119 
perfect stick for me you know some of

00:01:40.119 --> 00:01:41.999 
perfect stick for me you know some of
the<00:01:40.179> sticks<00:01:40.450> that<00:01:40.569> I've<00:01:40.690> played<00:01:40.960> earlier<00:01:41.350> that

00:01:41.999 --> 00:01:42.009 
the sticks that I've played earlier that

00:01:42.009 --> 00:01:44.010 
the sticks that I've played earlier that
were<00:01:42.130> heavy<00:01:42.369> sticks<00:01:42.789> that<00:01:43.000> had<00:01:43.450> like<00:01:43.780> more

00:01:44.010 --> 00:01:44.020 
were heavy sticks that had like more

00:01:44.020 --> 00:01:46.230 
were heavy sticks that had like more
about<00:01:44.170> like<00:01:44.979> a<00:01:45.009> barrel<00:01:45.459> shaped<00:01:45.729> either<00:01:45.970> that

00:01:46.230 --> 00:01:46.240 
about like a barrel shaped either that

00:01:46.240 --> 00:01:48.330 
about like a barrel shaped either that
or<00:01:46.270> more<00:01:46.630> of<00:01:46.750> a<00:01:46.840> round<00:01:47.080> tip<00:01:47.380> was<00:01:48.009> really

00:01:48.330 --> 00:01:48.340 
or more of a round tip was really

00:01:48.340 --> 00:01:50.190 
or more of a round tip was really
punishing<00:01:48.759> the<00:01:49.060> heads<00:01:49.270> and<00:01:49.509> I<00:01:49.539> played<00:01:49.990> pretty

00:01:50.190 --> 00:01:50.200 
punishing the heads and I played pretty

00:01:50.200 --> 00:01:52.350 
punishing the heads and I played pretty
hard<00:01:50.590> so<00:01:50.950> I<00:01:51.220> wanted<00:01:51.819> something<00:01:52.000> that<00:01:52.119> was<00:01:52.299> a

00:01:52.350 --> 00:01:52.360 
hard so I wanted something that was a

00:01:52.360 --> 00:01:54.749 
hard so I wanted something that was a
bit<00:01:52.600> milder<00:01:52.990> on<00:01:53.350> the<00:01:53.470> heads<00:01:53.679> -<00:01:53.979> so<00:01:54.250> and<00:01:54.580> that's

00:01:54.749 --> 00:01:54.759 
bit milder on the heads - so and that's

00:01:54.759 --> 00:01:56.729 
bit milder on the heads - so and that's
a<00:01:54.850> very<00:01:55.030> important<00:01:55.509> aspect<00:01:55.959> of<00:01:56.200> the<00:01:56.289> stick<00:01:56.530> for

00:01:56.729 --> 00:01:56.739 
a very important aspect of the stick for

00:01:56.739 --> 00:02:00.270 
a very important aspect of the stick for
me<00:01:56.860> my<00:01:57.429> stakes<00:01:57.670> would<00:01:57.910> always<00:01:58.030> break<00:01:59.099> from<00:02:00.099> up

00:02:00.270 --> 00:02:00.280 
me my stakes would always break from up

00:02:00.280 --> 00:02:01.830 
me my stakes would always break from up
here<00:02:00.459> you<00:02:00.640> know<00:02:00.789> and<00:02:00.940> and<00:02:01.119> then<00:02:01.300> then<00:02:01.509> go<00:02:01.660> down

00:02:01.830 --> 00:02:01.840 
here you know and and then then go down

00:02:01.840 --> 00:02:04.260 
here you know and and then then go down
so<00:02:02.229> I<00:02:02.470> wanted<00:02:03.009> that<00:02:03.190> I<00:02:03.369> wanted<00:02:03.700> that<00:02:03.819> very<00:02:03.970> neck

00:02:04.260 --> 00:02:04.270 
so I wanted that I wanted that very neck

00:02:04.270 --> 00:02:08.070 
so I wanted that I wanted that very neck
to<00:02:04.450> be<00:02:04.479> a<00:02:04.599> little<00:02:04.869> bit<00:02:05.140> beefier<00:02:06.750> so<00:02:07.750> that<00:02:07.899> was

00:02:08.070 --> 00:02:08.080 
to be a little bit beefier so that was

00:02:08.080 --> 00:02:09.869 
to be a little bit beefier so that was
like<00:02:08.289> the<00:02:08.349> second<00:02:08.890> aspect<00:02:09.190> of<00:02:09.459> it<00:02:09.610> of<00:02:09.700> course

00:02:09.869 --> 00:02:09.879 
like the second aspect of it of course

00:02:09.879 --> 00:02:11.490 
like the second aspect of it of course
and<00:02:10.060> then<00:02:10.269> you<00:02:10.330> have<00:02:10.479> the<00:02:10.629> total<00:02:11.200> length<00:02:11.349> of

00:02:11.490 --> 00:02:11.500 
and then you have the total length of

00:02:11.500 --> 00:02:13.710 
and then you have the total length of
the<00:02:11.620> stick<00:02:11.860> and<00:02:12.010> of<00:02:12.099> course<00:02:12.129> what<00:02:12.629> affects<00:02:13.629> the

00:02:13.710 --> 00:02:13.720 
the stick and of course what affects the

00:02:13.720 --> 00:02:15.720 
the stick and of course what affects the
balance<00:02:13.989> of<00:02:14.349> most<00:02:14.560> to<00:02:15.010> take<00:02:15.220> the<00:02:15.370> length<00:02:15.550> of

00:02:15.720 --> 00:02:15.730 
balance of most to take the length of

00:02:15.730 --> 00:02:17.910 
balance of most to take the length of
the<00:02:15.819> taper<00:02:16.060> but<00:02:16.900> it<00:02:16.989> was<00:02:17.110> really<00:02:17.379> fascinating

00:02:17.910 --> 00:02:17.920 
the taper but it was really fascinating

00:02:17.920 --> 00:02:19.589 
the taper but it was really fascinating
how<00:02:18.040> much<00:02:18.250> of<00:02:18.400> a<00:02:18.459> difference<00:02:18.879> it<00:02:19.030> made<00:02:19.209> going

00:02:19.589 --> 00:02:19.599 
how much of a difference it made going

00:02:19.599 --> 00:02:21.809 
how much of a difference it made going
