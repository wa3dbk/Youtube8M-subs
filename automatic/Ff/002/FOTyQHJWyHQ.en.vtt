00:00:49.960 --> 00:00:49.970 
or not see them from far away but I just

00:00:49.970 --> 00:00:51.790 
or not see them from far away but I just
feel<00:00:50.180> when<00:00:50.570> I<00:00:50.600> put<00:00:50.930> mascara<00:00:51.380> on<00:00:51.500> my<00:00:51.530> lower

00:00:51.790 --> 00:00:51.800 
feel when I put mascara on my lower

00:00:51.800 --> 00:00:53.770 
feel when I put mascara on my lower
lashes<00:00:52.100> and<00:00:52.460> especially<00:00:52.850> this<00:00:53.180> one<00:00:53.390> it<00:00:53.570> just

00:00:53.770 --> 00:00:53.780 
lashes and especially this one it just

00:00:53.780 --> 00:00:55.810 
lashes and especially this one it just
really<00:00:54.050> adds<00:00:54.470> to<00:00:54.920> the<00:00:55.130> eye<00:00:55.160> look<00:00:55.550> and<00:00:55.760> just

00:00:55.810 --> 00:00:55.820 
really adds to the eye look and just

00:00:55.820 --> 00:00:57.460 
really adds to the eye look and just
kind<00:00:56.090> of<00:00:56.150> balances<00:00:56.630> it<00:00:56.780> out<00:00:56.900> and<00:00:57.170> everything

00:00:57.460 --> 00:00:57.470 
kind of balances it out and everything

00:00:57.470 --> 00:00:59.560 
kind of balances it out and everything
so<00:00:58.220> of<00:00:58.340> course<00:00:58.580> it<00:00:58.700> depends<00:00:58.970> you<00:00:59.180> know<00:00:59.210> on<00:00:59.420> your
