about<00:00:48.750> that<00:00:48.899> big<00:00:48.960> know<00:00:49.320> what<00:00:49.440> you<00:00:49.530> didn't<00:00:49.710> have

00:00:49.819 --> 00:00:49.829 
about that big know what you didn't have

00:00:49.829 --> 00:00:52.310 
about that big know what you didn't have
to<00:00:49.950> do<00:00:50.039> is<00:00:50.360> you<00:00:51.360> get<00:00:51.510> just<00:00:51.660> a<00:00:51.809> little<00:00:51.840> small

to do is you get just a little small

00:00:52.320 --> 00:00:54.560 
to do is you get just a little small
earth<00:00:52.969> and<00:00:53.969> you're<00:00:54.090> going<00:00:54.210> to<00:00:54.329> put<00:00:54.480> a<00:00:54.510> little

00:00:54.560 --> 00:00:54.570 
earth and you're going to put a little

00:00:54.570 --> 00:00:59.370 
earth and you're going to put a little
cut<00:00:55.199> alone<00:00:55.680> right<00:00:55.890> here

00:00:59.370 --> 00:00:59.380 

00:00:59.380 --> 00:01:05.710 

once<00:01:00.380> you<00:01:00.470> have<00:01:00.560> the<00:01:00.680> two<00:01:00.830> cuts<00:01:04.510> you're<00:01:05.510> going

00:01:05.710 --> 00:01:05.720 
once you have the two cuts you're going

00:01:05.720 --> 00:01:11.550 
once you have the two cuts you're going
to<00:01:05.780> have<00:01:05.930> to<00:01:06.140> cut<00:01:07.130> this<00:01:07.400> little<00:01:07.640> section<00:01:07.940> out

00:01:11.550 --> 00:01:11.560 

00:01:11.560 --> 00:01:16.450 

and<00:01:12.560> make<00:01:12.830> it<00:01:13.010> a<00:01:13.190> pointed<00:01:13.970> tip<00:01:15.070> the<00:01:16.070> reason<00:01:16.340> why

00:01:16.450 --> 00:01:16.460 
and make it a pointed tip the reason why

00:01:16.460 --> 00:01:17.890 
and make it a pointed tip the reason why
you<00:01:16.490> do<00:01:16.730> this<00:01:16.820> is<00:01:17.030> that<00:01:17.150> it<00:01:17.300> touches<00:01:17.750> the

00:01:17.890 --> 00:01:17.900 
you do this is that it touches the

00:01:17.900 --> 00:01:19.390 
you do this is that it touches the
little<00:01:18.110> locking<00:01:18.530> mechanism<00:01:19.010> so<00:01:19.130> you're<00:01:19.280> able

00:01:19.390 --> 00:01:19.400 
little locking mechanism so you're able

00:01:19.400 --> 00:01:21.520 
little locking mechanism so you're able
to<00:01:19.640> open<00:01:19.880> the<00:01:19.940> lock<00:01:20.120> now<00:01:21.110> here's<00:01:21.290> what<00:01:21.440> it

00:01:21.520 --> 00:01:21.530 
to open the lock now here's what it

00:01:21.530 --> 00:01:24.880 
to open the lock now here's what it
should<00:01:21.650> look<00:01:21.680> like<00:01:21.770> once<00:01:22.040> you<00:01:22.130> cut<00:01:22.310> it<00:01:23.890> all

00:01:24.880 --> 00:01:24.890 
should look like once you cut it all

00:01:24.890 --> 00:01:26.080 
should look like once you cut it all
right<00:01:25.040> now<00:01:25.190> what<00:01:25.370> you're<00:01:25.610> going<00:01:25.790> to<00:01:25.880> have<00:01:25.970> to

00:01:26.080 --> 00:01:26.090 
right now what you're going to have to

00:01:26.090 --> 00:01:30.100 
right now what you're going to have to
do<00:01:26.240> is<00:01:27.340> take<00:01:28.340> this<00:01:28.580> and<00:01:28.880> fold<00:01:29.420> these<00:01:29.690> parts

00:01:30.100 --> 00:01:30.110 
do is take this and fold these parts

00:01:30.110 --> 00:01:35.640 
do is take this and fold these parts
back

00:01:35.640 --> 00:01:35.650 

00:01:35.650 --> 00:01:37.440 

and<00:01:35.770> if<00:01:36.340> you<00:01:36.460> want<00:01:36.640> to<00:01:36.730> be<00:01:36.820> more<00:01:36.970> sturdy<00:01:37.300> you

00:01:37.440 --> 00:01:37.450 
and if you want to be more sturdy you

00:01:37.450 --> 00:01:50.300 
and if you want to be more sturdy you
fold<00:01:37.750> the<00:01:37.810> top<00:01:38.050> down<00:01:38.320> like<00:01:38.800> so

00:01:50.300 --> 00:01:50.310 

00:01:50.310 --> 00:01:56.469 

here's<00:01:51.030> your<00:01:51.060> low<00:01:51.240> locked<00:01:51.509> mechanism<00:01:55.159> okay

00:01:56.469 --> 00:01:56.479 
here's your low locked mechanism okay

00:01:56.479 --> 00:01:59.990 
here's your low locked mechanism okay
let's<00:01:57.479> try<00:01:57.689> it<00:01:57.810> on<00:01:57.930> the<00:01:58.079> lock<00:01:58.310> okay<00:01:59.310> what<00:01:59.880> you

00:01:59.990 --> 00:02:00.000 
let's try it on the lock okay what you

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:04.520 
let's try it on the lock okay what you
do<00:02:00.149> is<00:02:00.210> you<00:02:00.299> put<00:02:00.509> it<00:02:00.570> on<00:02:00.720> the<00:02:00.840> hinge<00:02:01.460> and<00:02:03.530> you

00:02:04.520 --> 00:02:04.530 
do is you put it on the hinge and you

00:02:04.530 --> 00:02:10.759 
do is you put it on the hinge and you
push<00:02:04.920> down<00:02:07.369> into<00:02:08.369> the<00:02:08.459> lock<00:02:08.700> and<00:02:09.560> you<00:02:10.560> try

00:02:10.759 --> 00:02:10.769 
push down into the lock and you try

00:02:10.769 --> 00:02:12.650 
push down into the lock and you try
opening<00:02:11.009> it<00:02:11.310> don't<00:02:11.790> want<00:02:11.940> you<00:02:12.060> what<00:02:12.330> it<00:02:12.450> should

00:02:12.650 --> 00:02:12.660 
opening it don't want you what it should

00:02:12.660 --> 00:02:16.910 
opening it don't want you what it should
do<00:02:12.810> it<00:02:12.930> should<00:02:13.140> go<00:02:13.380> down<00:02:13.410> into<00:02:14.390> the<00:02:15.390> lock<00:02:15.920> touch

00:02:16.910 --> 00:02:16.920 
do it should go down into the lock touch

00:02:16.920 --> 00:02:18.680 
do it should go down into the lock touch
the<00:02:17.099> locking<00:02:17.430> mechanism<00:02:17.459> and<00:02:18.150> it<00:02:18.269> should<00:02:18.480> open

00:02:18.680 --> 00:02:18.690 
the locking mechanism and it should open

00:02:18.690 --> 00:02:21.320 
the locking mechanism and it should open
up<00:02:19.459> remember<00:02:20.459> it<00:02:20.519> has<00:02:20.640> to<00:02:20.790> go<00:02:20.940> on<00:02:20.970> the<00:02:21.120> left

00:02:21.320 --> 00:02:21.330 
up remember it has to go on the left

00:02:21.330 --> 00:02:31.700 
up remember it has to go on the left
side<00:02:21.540> like<00:02:21.780> this

00:02:31.700 --> 00:02:31.710 

00:02:31.710 --> 00:02:36.490 

okay<00:02:32.750> let's<00:02:33.750> try<00:02:34.050> it<00:02:34.170> out<00:02:34.320> a<00:02:34.350> little<00:02:34.560> bit<00:02:34.650> more

00:02:36.490 --> 00:02:36.500 
okay let's try it out a little bit more

00:02:36.500 --> 00:02:40.900 
okay let's try it out a little bit more
okay<00:02:37.500> let's<00:02:37.710> see<00:02:38.510> there<00:02:39.510> you<00:02:39.570> go<00:02:39.630> it<00:02:39.960> opened<00:02:40.260> up

00:02:40.900 --> 00:02:40.910 
okay let's see there you go it opened up

00:02:40.910 --> 00:02:43.130 
okay let's see there you go it opened up
that's<00:02:41.910> how<00:02:42.030> I<00:02:42.060> locking<00:02:42.390> mechanism<00:02:42.810> works<00:02:43.020> i

00:02:43.130 --> 00:02:43.140 
that's how I locking mechanism works i

00:02:43.140 --> 00:02:44.330 
that's how I locking mechanism works i
just<00:02:43.320> showed<00:02:43.470> you<00:02:43.590> how<00:02:43.680> to<00:02:43.710> hack<00:02:43.890> open<00:02:44.100> a

00:02:44.330 --> 00:02:44.340 
just showed you how to hack open a

00:02:44.340 --> 00:02:50.420 
just showed you how to hack open a
combination<00:02:44.850> lock<00:02:47.660> there<00:02:48.660> you<00:02:48.750> go<00:02:49.310> spook<00:02:50.310> of

00:02:50.420 --> 00:02:50.430 
combination lock there you go spook of

00:02:50.430 --> 00:02:53.540 
combination lock there you go spook of
the<00:02:50.490> c9<00:02:50.880> same<00:02:51.120> to<00:02:51.420> you
