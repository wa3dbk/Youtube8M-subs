00:00:15.950 --> 00:00:15.960 

00:00:15.960 --> 00:00:18.330 

the<00:00:16.960> first<00:00:17.200> thing<00:00:17.380> that<00:00:17.410> I<00:00:17.590> looked<00:00:17.830> for<00:00:18.130> when<00:00:18.310> I

00:00:18.330 --> 00:00:18.340 
the first thing that I looked for when I

00:00:18.340 --> 00:00:20.519 
the first thing that I looked for when I
was<00:00:18.490> shopping<00:00:18.850> around<00:00:19.180> for<00:00:19.330> a<00:00:19.450> camera<00:00:19.810> was<00:00:20.170> the

00:00:20.519 --> 00:00:20.529 
was shopping around for a camera was the

00:00:20.529 --> 00:00:23.100 
was shopping around for a camera was the
price<00:00:20.740> point<00:00:21.070> this<00:00:21.610> thing<00:00:21.670> came<00:00:22.150> in<00:00:22.330> just<00:00:22.930> at

00:00:23.100 --> 00:00:23.110 
price point this thing came in just at

00:00:23.110 --> 00:00:25.710 
price point this thing came in just at
$200<00:00:23.920> so<00:00:24.279> it<00:00:24.430> fit<00:00:24.670> within<00:00:24.910> kind<00:00:25.330> of<00:00:25.390> a<00:00:25.509> hard

00:00:25.710 --> 00:00:25.720 
$200 so it fit within kind of a hard

00:00:25.720 --> 00:00:29.640 
$200 so it fit within kind of a hard
budget<00:00:26.140> I<00:00:26.259> had<00:00:26.700> and<00:00:27.700> for<00:00:28.360> the<00:00:28.540> $200<00:00:29.200> you<00:00:29.320> get<00:00:29.619> a

00:00:45.990 --> 00:00:46.000 
zoom that also goes up to 2,000 times so

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:48.420 
zoom that also goes up to 2,000 times so
that's<00:00:46.480> a<00:00:46.780> lot<00:00:47.110> of<00:00:47.140> zoom<00:00:47.440> in<00:00:47.469> a<00:00:47.830> really
