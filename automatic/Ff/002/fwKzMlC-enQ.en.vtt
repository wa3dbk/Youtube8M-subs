00:00:54.059 --> 00:00:58.010 
settings and device profile should be
ICS<00:00:54.629> jbw<00:00:55.469> LAN<00:00:55.860> zero<00:00:56.390> okay<00:00:57.390> we'll<00:00:57.570> scroll<00:00:57.840> down

00:00:58.010 --> 00:00:58.020 
ICS jbw LAN zero okay we'll scroll down

00:00:58.020 --> 00:01:01.819 
ICS jbw LAN zero okay we'll scroll down
to<00:00:58.230> the<00:00:58.379> Wi-Fi<00:00:59.809> driver<00:01:00.809> reload<00:01:01.379> make<00:01:01.680> sure

to the Wi-Fi driver reload make sure

00:01:01.829 --> 00:01:04.070 
to the Wi-Fi driver reload make sure
that<00:01:01.949> that<00:01:02.129> is<00:01:02.280> checked<00:01:02.609> and<00:01:03.270> they<00:01:03.750> keep<00:01:03.930> a

00:01:04.070 --> 00:01:04.080 
that that is checked and they keep a

00:01:04.080 --> 00:01:05.479 
that that is checked and they keep a
live<00:01:04.229> connection<00:01:04.589> we'll<00:01:04.979> go<00:01:05.040> ahead<00:01:05.100> and<00:01:05.309> check

00:01:05.479 --> 00:01:05.489 
live connection we'll go ahead and check

00:01:05.489 --> 00:01:07.030 
live connection we'll go ahead and check
that

00:01:07.030 --> 00:01:07.040 
that

00:01:07.040 --> 00:01:09.050 
that
so<00:01:08.040> that<00:01:08.189> should<00:01:08.490> do<00:01:08.729> it

00:01:09.050 --> 00:01:09.060 
so that should do it

00:01:09.060 --> 00:01:12.230 
so that should do it
it<00:01:09.420> should<00:01:09.689> actually<00:01:09.869> work<00:01:10.170> now<00:01:11.030> so<00:01:12.030> go<00:01:12.150> ahead

00:01:12.230 --> 00:01:12.240 
it should actually work now so go ahead

00:01:12.240 --> 00:01:17.359 
it should actually work now so go ahead
and<00:01:12.330> test<00:01:12.600> it<00:01:12.750> out<00:01:15.890> it's<00:01:16.890> going<00:01:17.009> to<00:01:17.070> ask<00:01:17.250> for

00:01:17.359 --> 00:01:17.369 
and test it out it's going to ask for

00:01:17.369 --> 00:01:19.310 
and test it out it's going to ask for
root<00:01:17.720> permissions<00:01:18.720> we'll<00:01:18.960> go<00:01:19.049> ahead<00:01:19.170> and

00:01:19.310 --> 00:01:19.320 
root permissions we'll go ahead and

00:01:19.320 --> 00:01:24.230 
root permissions we'll go ahead and
grant<00:01:19.500> that<00:01:21.799> okay<00:01:22.799> so<00:01:22.860> now<00:01:23.130> we<00:01:23.189> are<00:01:23.430> tethering

00:01:24.230 --> 00:01:24.240

00:02:17.490 --> 00:02:19.160 
I'm kind of in an area that's on the
fringe<00:02:17.730> that<00:02:17.940> shouldn't<00:02:18.330> be<00:02:18.420> too<00:02:18.660> blazing

00:02:19.160 --> 00:02:19.170 
fringe that shouldn't be too blazing

00:02:19.170 --> 00:02:23.990 
fringe that shouldn't be too blazing
fast<00:02:22.010> I'm<00:02:23.010> guessing<00:02:23.370> we'll<00:02:23.520> be<00:02:23.640> at<00:02:23.820> about

00:02:23.990 --> 00:02:24.000 
fast I'm guessing we'll be at about

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:28.370 
fast I'm guessing we'll be at about
maybe<00:02:24.570> 10<00:02:25.170> Meg<00:02:25.470> down<00:02:26.250> if<00:02:26.550> I'm<00:02:26.730> lucky<00:02:27.200> one<00:02:28.200> and<00:02:28.350> a

00:02:28.370 --> 00:02:28.380 
maybe 10 Meg down if I'm lucky one and a

00:02:28.380 --> 00:02:40.559 
maybe 10 Meg down if I'm lucky one and a
half<00:02:28.560> up<00:02:28.740> probably

00:02:40.559 --> 00:02:40.569 

00:02:40.569 --> 00:02:42.089 

so<00:02:41.140> we're<00:02:41.290> getting<00:02:41.409> a<00:02:41.530> little<00:02:41.620> better<00:02:41.829> than

00:02:42.089 --> 00:02:42.099 
so we're getting a little better than

00:02:42.099 --> 00:02:44.940 
so we're getting a little better than
what<00:02:42.310> I<00:02:42.370> was<00:02:42.640> thinking<00:02:43.620> definitely<00:02:44.620> better

00:02:44.940 --> 00:02:44.950 
what I was thinking definitely better

00:02:44.950 --> 00:02:47.399 
what I was thinking definitely better
