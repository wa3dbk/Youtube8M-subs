00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:23.010 
activate but sometimes you can just

00:00:23.010 --> 00:00:24.560 
activate but sometimes you can just
subscribe<00:00:23.250> it<00:00:23.550> and<00:00:23.640> right<00:00:23.850> here<00:00:24.119> there<00:00:24.359> are

00:00:24.560 --> 00:00:24.570

00:00:26.540 --> 00:00:26.550 
three of them and the first one I got

00:00:26.550 --> 00:00:31.700 
three of them and the first one I got
was<00:00:27.170> by<00:00:28.170> pulling<00:00:28.710> down<00:00:28.949> on<00:00:28.980> a<00:00:29.130> rope<00:00:29.340> and<00:00:30.619> one<00:00:31.619> of

00:00:31.700 --> 00:00:31.710 
was by pulling down on a rope and one of

00:00:31.710 --> 00:00:33.830 
was by pulling down on a rope and one of
the<00:00:31.800> shorter<00:00:32.219> videos<00:00:32.520> of<00:00:32.669> course<00:00:32.910> the<00:00:33.239> all<00:00:33.780> of

00:00:33.830 --> 00:00:33.840 
the shorter videos of course the all of

00:00:33.840 --> 00:00:35.240 
the shorter videos of course the all of
them<00:00:34.079> the<00:00:34.200> blue<00:00:34.410> bricks<00:00:34.649> seem<00:00:34.829> to<00:00:34.950> take<00:00:35.130> the

00:00:35.240 --> 00:00:35.250 
them the blue bricks seem to take the

00:00:35.250 --> 00:00:39.290 
them the blue bricks seem to take the
longest<00:00:35.719> except<00:00:36.719> for<00:00:36.899> the<00:00:37.640> massacre<00:00:38.640> say<00:00:39.030> the

00:00:39.290 --> 00:00:39.300 
longest except for the massacre say the

00:00:39.300 --> 00:00:42.459 
longest except for the massacre say the
red<00:00:39.450> breaks<00:00:39.719> take<00:00:39.960> the<00:00:40.110> longest<00:00:40.500> for<00:00:40.620> that<00:00:40.770> one

00:00:42.459 --> 00:00:42.469 
red breaks take the longest for that one

00:00:42.469 --> 00:00:48.350 
red breaks take the longest for that one
anyway<00:00:43.469> uh<00:00:46.340> just<00:00:47.340> go<00:00:47.670> around<00:00:48.000> getting<00:00:48.180> them

00:00:48.350 --> 00:00:48.360 
anyway uh just go around getting them

00:00:48.360 --> 00:00:49.369 
anyway uh just go around getting them
all<00:00:48.510> day<00:00:48.719> huh

00:00:49.369 --> 00:00:49.379 
all day huh

00:00:49.379 --> 00:00:51.350 
all day huh
these<00:00:49.800> red<00:00:50.010> bricks<00:00:50.219> give<00:00:50.489> you<00:00:50.670> another<00:00:51.000> stuff

00:00:51.350 --> 00:00:51.360 
these red bricks give you another stuff

00:00:51.360 --> 00:00:54.680 
these red bricks give you another stuff
multiplier<00:00:51.870> which<00:00:52.460> obviously<00:00:53.460> stack<00:00:54.059> on<00:00:54.390> the

00:00:54.680 --> 00:00:54.690 
multiplier which obviously stack on the

00:00:54.690 --> 00:00:58.310 
multiplier which obviously stack on the
other<00:00:55.620> multipliers<00:00:56.219> so<00:00:56.820> it<00:00:57.030> gives<00:00:57.329> you<00:00:57.539> tons

00:00:58.310 --> 00:00:58.320 
other multipliers so it gives you tons

00:00:58.320 --> 00:01:00.770 
other multipliers so it gives you tons
of<00:00:58.530> tons<00:00:58.680> of<00:00:58.859> stud<00:00:59.190> starts<00:01:00.000> especially<00:01:00.600> many

00:01:00.770 --> 00:01:00.780 
of tons of stud starts especially many

00:01:00.780 --> 00:01:02.270 
of tons of stud starts especially many
of<00:01:00.930> all<00:01:01.079> of<00:01:01.230> them<00:01:01.350> where<00:01:01.500> you<00:01:01.559> can<00:01:01.710> get<00:01:01.770> billion

00:01:02.270 --> 00:01:02.280 
of all of them where you can get billion

00:01:02.280 --> 00:01:05.240 
of all of them where you can get billion
for<00:01:02.460> studs<00:01:02.760> like<00:01:03.110> instantly<00:01:04.110> and<00:01:04.650> strangely

00:01:05.240 --> 00:01:05.250 
for studs like instantly and strangely

00:01:05.250 --> 00:01:07.070 
for studs like instantly and strangely
this<00:01:05.489> Cape<00:01:05.700> 4<00:01:05.939> billion<00:01:06.299> isn't<00:01:06.570> the<00:01:06.630> max<00:01:06.840> amount

00:01:07.070 --> 00:01:07.080 
this Cape 4 billion isn't the max amount

00:01:07.080 --> 00:01:09.200 
this Cape 4 billion isn't the max amount
of<00:01:07.229> studs<00:01:07.530> all<00:01:08.010> these<00:01:08.250> on<00:01:08.430> that<00:01:08.580> PC<00:01:08.939> I<00:01:08.970> don't

00:01:09.200 --> 00:01:09.210 
of studs all these on that PC I don't

00:01:09.210 --> 00:01:10.130 
of studs all these on that PC I don't
know<00:01:09.270> if<00:01:09.330> it's<00:01:09.450> any<00:01:09.570> different<00:01:09.689> for<00:01:10.020> the

00:01:10.130 --> 00:01:10.140 
know if it's any different for the

00:01:10.140 --> 00:01:12.109 
know if it's any different for the
consoles<00:01:10.530> but<00:01:10.740> I<00:01:10.979> don't<00:01:11.700> know<00:01:11.760> what<00:01:11.850> the<00:01:11.939> max

00:01:12.109 --> 00:01:12.119 
consoles but I don't know what the max

00:01:12.119 --> 00:01:15.320 
consoles but I don't know what the max
amount<00:01:12.270> of<00:01:12.390> studs<00:01:12.630> it<00:01:12.810> actually<00:01:13.200> is<00:01:13.350> I<00:01:14.330> don't

00:01:15.320 --> 00:01:15.330 
amount of studs it actually is I don't

00:01:15.330 --> 00:01:19.100 
amount of studs it actually is I don't
know<00:01:16.400> but<00:01:17.400> yeah<00:01:17.670> that's<00:01:17.850> pretty<00:01:18.750> much<00:01:18.869> it

00:01:19.100 --> 00:01:19.110 
know but yeah that's pretty much it

00:01:19.110 --> 00:01:20.929 
know but yeah that's pretty much it
there's<00:01:19.320> a<00:01:19.380> really<00:01:19.710> much<00:01:19.860> else<00:01:19.920> to<00:01:20.189> say<00:01:20.430> so<00:01:20.460> I

00:01:20.929 --> 00:01:20.939 
there's a really much else to say so I

00:01:20.939 --> 00:01:22.789 
there's a really much else to say so I
get<00:01:21.570> all<00:01:21.689> the<00:01:21.750> red<00:01:21.900> bricks<00:01:22.140> by<00:01:22.470> the<00:01:22.530> power

00:01:22.789 --> 00:01:22.799 
get all the red bricks by the power

00:01:22.799 --> 00:01:24.740 
get all the red bricks by the power
brick<00:01:23.070> as<00:01:23.729> soon<00:01:23.880> as<00:01:23.939> you<00:01:24.030> can<00:01:24.180> because<00:01:24.240> that's

00:01:24.740 --> 00:01:24.750 
brick as soon as you can because that's

00:01:24.750 --> 00:01:27.020 
brick as soon as you can because that's
argue<00:01:25.470> well<00:01:25.830> to<00:01:26.100> me<00:01:26.250> it's<00:01:26.460> the<00:01:26.640> most<00:01:26.670> useful

00:01:27.020 --> 00:01:27.030 
argue well to me it's the most useful

00:01:27.030 --> 00:01:30.979 
argue well to me it's the most useful
and<00:01:27.979> yeah
