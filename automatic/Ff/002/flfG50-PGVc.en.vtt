00:00:03.830 --> 00:00:03.840 
hey YouTube I just figured I just got

00:00:03.840 --> 00:00:05.570 
hey YouTube I just figured I just got
done<00:00:04.020> vacuuming<00:00:04.230> out<00:00:04.650> the<00:00:04.830> interior<00:00:05.310> and<00:00:05.430> was

00:00:05.570 --> 00:00:05.580 
done vacuuming out the interior and was

00:00:05.580 --> 00:00:07.309 
done vacuuming out the interior and was
getting<00:00:05.759> ready<00:00:05.879> to<00:00:06.120> do<00:00:06.660> some<00:00:06.870> of<00:00:06.990> the<00:00:07.049> swap

00:00:07.309 --> 00:00:07.319 
getting ready to do some of the swap

00:00:07.319 --> 00:00:08.950 
getting ready to do some of the swap
that<00:00:07.529> I<00:00:07.620> talked<00:00:07.830> about<00:00:07.980> in<00:00:08.309> the<00:00:08.400> other<00:00:08.429> video

00:00:08.950 --> 00:00:08.960 
that I talked about in the other video

00:00:08.960 --> 00:00:11.150 
that I talked about in the other video
but<00:00:09.960> I<00:00:10.019> wanted<00:00:10.290> to<00:00:10.440> show<00:00:10.590> you<00:00:10.620> guys<00:00:10.740> because<00:00:11.070> I

00:00:11.150 --> 00:00:11.160 
but I wanted to show you guys because I

00:00:11.160 --> 00:00:13.339 
but I wanted to show you guys because I
told<00:00:11.370> you<00:00:11.580> that<00:00:12.269> the<00:00:12.389> stock<00:00:12.630> suspension<00:00:12.840> will

00:00:13.339 --> 00:00:13.349 
told you that the stock suspension will

00:00:13.349 --> 00:00:15.620 
told you that the stock suspension will
flex<00:00:13.710> and<00:00:14.160> the<00:00:14.280> rear<00:00:14.460> of<00:00:14.580> these<00:00:14.700> substantially

00:00:15.620 --> 00:00:15.630 
flex and the rear of these substantially

00:00:15.630 --> 00:00:20.540 
flex and the rear of these substantially
so<00:00:16.470> I<00:00:16.500> figured<00:00:16.800> I'd<00:00:16.920> show<00:00:17.160> you<00:00:19.160> this<00:00:20.160> is<00:00:20.340> pretty

00:00:20.540 --> 00:00:20.550 
so I figured I'd show you this is pretty

00:00:20.550 --> 00:00:23.720 
so I figured I'd show you this is pretty
much<00:00:20.760> at<00:00:20.970> full<00:00:21.210> full<00:00:21.810> flex<00:00:22.170> it<00:00:23.039> is<00:00:23.400> at<00:00:23.580> full

00:00:23.720 --> 00:00:23.730 
much at full full flex it is at full

00:00:23.730 --> 00:00:26.260 
much at full full flex it is at full
clubs<00:00:24.090> you<00:00:24.269> can<00:00:24.420> tell

00:00:26.260 --> 00:00:26.270 
clubs you can tell

00:00:26.270 --> 00:00:28.690 
clubs you can tell
see<00:00:27.140> brake<00:00:27.350> line<00:00:27.560> is<00:00:27.770> stressed<00:00:28.130> pretty<00:00:28.490> much

00:00:28.690 --> 00:00:28.700 
see brake line is stressed pretty much

00:00:28.700 --> 00:00:31.210 
see brake line is stressed pretty much
all<00:00:28.910> the<00:00:29.029> way<00:00:29.090> tight<00:00:29.650> I'm<00:00:30.650> pretty<00:00:30.860> sure<00:00:31.039> that

00:00:31.210 --> 00:00:31.220 
all the way tight I'm pretty sure that

00:00:31.220 --> 00:00:35.580 
all the way tight I'm pretty sure that
shock<00:00:31.490> is<00:00:31.730> completely<00:00:33.190> stretched<00:00:34.190> out

00:00:35.580 --> 00:00:35.590 
shock is completely stretched out

00:00:35.590 --> 00:00:39.270 
shock is completely stretched out
spring<00:00:36.430> still<00:00:36.730> stay<00:00:37.000> seated<00:00:37.980> barely<00:00:38.980> but<00:00:39.160> it

00:00:39.270 --> 00:00:39.280 
spring still stay seated barely but it

00:00:39.280 --> 00:00:41.430 
spring still stay seated barely but it
is

00:00:41.430 --> 00:00:41.440 
is

00:00:41.440 --> 00:00:43.259 
is
you<00:00:41.859> see<00:00:42.010> the<00:00:42.160> front<00:00:42.399> suspension<00:00:42.550> doesn't

00:00:43.259 --> 00:00:43.269 
you see the front suspension doesn't

00:00:43.269 --> 00:00:49.120 
you see the front suspension doesn't
really<00:00:43.420> move<00:00:43.899> a<00:00:44.019> whole<00:00:44.170> hell<00:00:44.410> of<00:00:44.440> a<00:00:44.590> lot

00:00:49.120 --> 00:00:49.130 

00:00:49.130 --> 00:00:53.110 

there

00:00:53.110 --> 00:00:53.120 

00:00:53.120 --> 00:00:57.070 

-<00:00:53.270> there<00:00:55.060> keep<00:00:56.060> in<00:00:56.180> mind<00:00:56.360> my<00:00:56.510> fenders<00:00:56.930> are

00:00:57.070 --> 00:00:57.080 
- there keep in mind my fenders are

00:00:57.080 --> 00:01:00.100 
- there keep in mind my fenders are
trims<00:00:58.060> same<00:00:59.060> with<00:00:59.180> the<00:00:59.270> back<00:00:59.420> fenders<00:00:59.960> are

00:01:00.100 --> 00:01:00.110 
trims same with the back fenders are

00:01:00.110 --> 00:01:02.120 
trims same with the back fenders are
trimmed

00:01:02.120 --> 00:01:02.130 
trimmed

00:01:02.130 --> 00:01:05.189 
trimmed
the<00:01:02.460> tops<00:01:02.730> exercise<00:01:03.480> just<00:01:03.810> rolled

00:01:05.189 --> 00:01:05.199 
the tops exercise just rolled

00:01:05.199 --> 00:01:06.929 
the tops exercise just rolled
that<00:01:05.560> tire<00:01:05.770> is<00:01:05.950> not<00:01:06.100> rubbing<00:01:06.520> in<00:01:06.640> the<00:01:06.729> fender

00:01:06.929 --> 00:01:06.939 
that tire is not rubbing in the fender

00:01:06.939 --> 00:01:11.990 
that tire is not rubbing in the fender
well<00:01:07.210> yet<00:01:07.539> but<00:01:07.869> it<00:01:08.560> will

00:01:11.990 --> 00:01:12.000 

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:14.180 

so<00:01:12.570> that<00:01:12.810> site<00:01:13.020> will<00:01:13.170> compress<00:01:13.560> actually<00:01:14.160> a

00:01:14.180 --> 00:01:14.190 
so that site will compress actually a

00:01:14.190 --> 00:01:18.740 
so that site will compress actually a
little<00:01:14.520> bit<00:01:14.820> more<00:01:16.910> we're<00:01:17.910> out<00:01:18.090> wheeling<00:01:18.600> it

00:01:18.740 --> 00:01:18.750 
little bit more we're out wheeling it

00:01:18.750 --> 00:01:22.400 
little bit more we're out wheeling it
definitely<00:01:19.530> would<00:01:20.450> saw<00:01:21.450> my<00:01:21.600> truck<00:01:21.870> sounds<00:01:22.320> of

00:01:22.400 --> 00:01:22.410 
definitely would saw my truck sounds of

00:01:22.410 --> 00:01:29.260 
definitely would saw my truck sounds of
idle<00:01:25.970> so<00:01:26.970> I<00:01:27.330> actually<00:01:28.260> did<00:01:28.800> this

00:01:29.260 --> 00:01:29.270 
idle so I actually did this

00:01:29.270 --> 00:01:31.970 
idle so I actually did this
realistically<00:01:30.270> because<00:01:30.710> something's<00:01:31.710> loose

00:01:31.970 --> 00:01:31.980 
realistically because something's loose

00:01:31.980 --> 00:01:35.270 
realistically because something's loose
in<00:01:32.280> the<00:01:32.370> rear<00:01:32.550> end<00:01:32.790> I<00:01:33.150> can<00:01:33.960> feel<00:01:34.170> it<00:01:34.350> I'm<00:01:35.070> not

00:01:35.270 --> 00:01:35.280 
in the rear end I can feel it I'm not

00:01:35.280 --> 00:01:38.600 
in the rear end I can feel it I'm not
sure<00:01:35.340> if<00:01:35.700> it's<00:01:35.940> my<00:01:36.150> driveline<00:01:37.310> you<00:01:38.310> know<00:01:38.370> maybe

00:01:38.600 --> 00:01:38.610 
sure if it's my driveline you know maybe

00:01:38.610 --> 00:01:41.780 
sure if it's my driveline you know maybe
the<00:01:38.790> carrier<00:01:39.180> bearing<00:01:39.660> where<00:01:40.170> the<00:01:40.790> opinion

00:01:41.780 --> 00:01:41.790 
the carrier bearing where the opinion

00:01:41.790 --> 00:01:45.290 
the carrier bearing where the opinion
goes<00:01:42.000> into<00:01:42.360> the<00:01:42.950> carrier<00:01:43.950> I'm<00:01:44.910> not<00:01:45.090> sure

00:01:45.290 --> 00:01:45.300 
goes into the carrier I'm not sure

00:01:45.300 --> 00:01:46.940 
goes into the carrier I'm not sure
something's<00:01:45.810> loose<00:01:46.020> back<00:01:46.290> here<00:01:46.500> I<00:01:46.530> can<00:01:46.710> feel

00:01:46.940 --> 00:01:46.950 
something's loose back here I can feel

00:01:46.950 --> 00:01:49.730 
something's loose back here I can feel
it<00:01:47.160> I<00:01:47.790> don't<00:01:48.420> see<00:01:48.660> it<00:01:48.810> in<00:01:48.930> the<00:01:49.020> bushings<00:01:49.470> but
