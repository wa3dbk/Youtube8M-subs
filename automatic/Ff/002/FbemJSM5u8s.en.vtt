00:02:01.600 --> 00:02:01.610 
and I used to be so afraid of digital

00:02:01.610 --> 00:02:03.100 
and I used to be so afraid of digital
things<00:02:01.820> I<00:02:02.090> think<00:02:02.360> they<00:02:02.510> scared<00:02:02.840> the<00:02:02.900> crap

00:02:03.100 --> 00:02:03.110

00:02:12.580 --> 00:02:12.590 
and it's a good riding tool to march

00:02:12.590 --> 00:02:14.080 
and it's a good riding tool to march
around<00:02:12.740> something<00:02:13.130> like<00:02:13.370> he<00:02:13.700> just<00:02:13.880> rolled

00:02:14.080 --> 00:02:14.090 
around something like he just rolled

00:02:14.090 --> 00:02:18.310 
around something like he just rolled
through<00:02:14.390> the<00:02:14.450> presets<00:02:14.959> and<00:02:15.459> inspire<00:02:16.459> right<00:02:17.320> so

people<00:02:30.260> on<00:02:30.320> a<00:02:30.350> tool<00:02:30.590> belt<00:02:30.740> we<00:02:30.950> have

00:02:31.060 --> 00:02:31.070 
people on a tool belt we have

00:02:31.070 --> 00:02:33.070 
people on a tool belt we have
instruments<00:02:31.400> any<00:02:32.030> instrument<00:02:32.630> to<00:02:32.720> write<00:02:32.900> with

instruments any instrument to write with

00:02:33.080 --> 00:02:34.810 
instruments any instrument to write with
and<00:02:33.230> that's<00:02:33.350> how<00:02:33.470> we<00:02:33.530> kill<00:02:34.070> you<00:02:34.250> and<00:02:34.370> I<00:02:34.430> create

00:02:34.810 --> 00:02:34.820

00:02:36.790 --> 00:02:36.800 
and I think that for me that was just

00:02:36.800 --> 00:02:38.260 
and I think that for me that was just
another<00:02:37.130> tool<00:02:37.430> for<00:02:37.459> me<00:02:37.760> that<00:02:37.940> I<00:02:37.970> could<00:02:38.180> just

00:02:38.260 --> 00:02:38.270 
another tool for me that I could just

00:02:38.270 --> 00:02:39.830 
another tool for me that I could just
kind<00:02:38.480> of<00:02:38.570> roll

00:02:39.830 --> 00:02:39.840 
kind of roll

00:02:39.840 --> 00:02:42.240 
kind of roll
180<00:02:40.840> effects<00:02:41.230> pedals<00:02:41.590> right<00:02:41.650> in<00:02:41.830> front<00:02:42.040> of<00:02:42.100> me

00:02:42.240 --> 00:02:42.250 
180 effects pedals right in front of me

00:02:42.250 --> 00:02:44.220 
180 effects pedals right in front of me
that<00:02:42.700> I<00:02:42.730> had<00:02:42.910> to<00:02:43.030> tweak<00:02:43.330> this<00:02:43.750> thing<00:02:43.930> makes<00:02:44.110> a

00:02:44.220 --> 00:02:44.230 
that I had to tweak this thing makes a

00:02:44.230 --> 00:02:46.050 
that I had to tweak this thing makes a
lot<00:02:44.440> easier<00:02:44.890> sounds<00:02:45.580> like<00:02:45.670> an<00:02:45.790> advertisement

00:02:46.050 --> 00:02:46.060 
lot easier sounds like an advertisement
