pack<00:01:52.509> that<00:01:53.509> would<00:01:53.749> connect<00:01:54.079> to<00:01:54.169> this<00:01:54.709> table<00:01:54.950> so

00:01:55.269 --> 00:01:55.279 
pack that would connect to this table so

00:01:55.279 --> 00:01:58.149 
pack that would connect to this table so
these<00:01:55.399> two<00:01:55.609> cables<00:01:55.819> connect<00:01:56.329> to<00:01:57.020> help<00:01:57.770> charge

00:01:58.149 --> 00:01:58.159 
these two cables connect to help charge

00:01:58.159 --> 00:02:01.659 
these two cables connect to help charge

00:05:26.480 --> 00:05:26.490 
it will make it a little bit lighter

00:05:26.490 --> 00:05:29.210 
it will make it a little bit lighter
though<00:05:26.820> having<00:05:27.270> no<00:05:28.260> other<00:05:28.289> extra<00:05:28.800> piece<00:05:29.010> to

00:05:30.570 --> 00:05:32.630 
cover it up so that's just kind of
something<00:05:31.020> a<00:05:31.200> personal<00:05:31.770> preference<00:05:31.979> again

00:05:32.630 --> 00:05:32.640
