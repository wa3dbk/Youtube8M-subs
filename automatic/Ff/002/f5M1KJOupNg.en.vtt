00:00:17.090 --> 00:00:24.240
 hello to all today we will take care 

00:00:19.440 --> 00:00:26.040
 cooler master haf stickers 935 is a 

00:00:24.240 --> 00:00:30.329
 simply huge case 

00:00:26.040 --> 00:00:33.000
 modular 935 is composed of two 

00:00:30.329 --> 00:00:35.850
 parts the main part is the 

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:38.600
 little part the 915 tunes you see 

00:00:35.850 --> 00:00:40.950
 there is a mini-itx chassis 

00:00:38.600 --> 00:00:44.010
 the main part the chassis 

00:00:40.950 --> 00:00:46.920
 main so this is the range afgoye ya 

00:00:44.010 --> 00:00:48.449
 a lot of maske's use and 

00:00:46.920 --> 00:00:50.280
 he has the top of the case that is 

00:00:48.449 --> 00:00:53.760
 completely open to communicate 

00:00:50.280 --> 00:00:54.780
 with the 915 m so basically you go 

00:00:53.760 --> 00:00:58.890
 see a little bit later in the 

00:00:54.780 --> 00:01:00.660
 video the case is made up of both 

00:00:58.890 --> 00:01:02.749
 modules that come piling up one in 

00:01:00.660 --> 00:01:05.850
 the other 

00:01:02.749 --> 00:01:07.590
 so like the whole haf range it has 

00:01:05.850 --> 00:01:11.400
 of a lot of air intakes a lot of 

00:01:07.590 --> 00:01:12.750
 opening winds you saw what 

00:01:11.400 --> 00:01:14.159
 allows to pass 

00:01:12.750 --> 00:01:15.710
 liquid cooling the piping 

00:01:14.159 --> 00:01:19.400
 liquid cooling 

00:01:15.710 --> 00:01:22.320
 the manufacturing quality is very good 

00:01:19.400 --> 00:01:24.930
 the cooler master range anyway 

00:01:22.320 --> 00:01:28.260
 rarely suffer from defect at this level 

00:01:24.930 --> 00:01:29.430
 there then inside obviously the 

00:01:28.260 --> 00:01:31.800
 first thing is the ability 

00:01:29.430 --> 00:01:36.660
 home the number of hard drives so 

00:01:31.800 --> 00:01:38.070
 Here we have an overview of 2.2 

00:01:36.660 --> 00:01:43.200
 capabilities scalability 

00:01:38.070 --> 00:01:44.850
 so everything is safe shot so is there 

00:01:43.200 --> 00:01:47.490
 immediately you see yourself there is 

00:01:44.850 --> 00:01:50.400
 what store placing new hard drives 

00:01:47.490 --> 00:01:52.760
 3 and a half inches on it's sure it's 

00:01:50.400 --> 00:01:52.760
 bella 

00:01:55.189 --> 00:02:04.470
 easy editing obviously there are three 

00:02:00.240 --> 00:02:05.670
 5 1/4 bays good all the connectivity 

00:02:04.470 --> 00:02:07.799
 sailboats has a lot of passages from 

00:02:05.670 --> 00:02:11.039
 cables you see them also down there 

00:02:07.799 --> 00:02:12.510
 will speak just now and there is one 

00:02:11.039 --> 00:02:14.790
 kind of double wall counterpoison 

00:02:12.510 --> 00:02:16.080
 which allows you to store 

00:02:14.790 --> 00:02:18.450
 cables what is it that is very good 

00:02:16.080 --> 00:02:20.580
 on cases go we will say normal 

00:02:18.450 --> 00:02:23.489
 on high-end housing and this 

00:02:20.580 --> 00:02:25.349
 part there too open down you 

00:02:23.489 --> 00:02:27.239
 see it later it can serve a 

00:02:25.349 --> 00:02:29.160
 still given the scalability to the case 

00:02:27.239 --> 00:02:30.540
 so behind the part behind this is 

00:02:29.160 --> 00:02:32.790
 this part that makes it possible to do all 

00:02:30.540 --> 00:02:35.670
 its cable braids there is space 

00:02:32.790 --> 00:02:37.620
 quite nice enough you see that 

00:02:35.670 --> 00:02:42.180
 front side there we will try to 

00:02:37.620 --> 00:02:43.910
 get a little closer to the space for 

00:02:42.180 --> 00:02:47.310
 pass the cables even when widely 

00:02:43.910 --> 00:02:50.130
 what you need to see that in front 

00:02:47.310 --> 00:02:51.690
 before difficult enough to see well I 

00:02:50.130 --> 00:02:54.030
 am not very good at light level but 

00:02:51.690 --> 00:02:57.299
 there is no fan on the front 

00:02:54.030 --> 00:03:00.030
 but there is room in m for everything 

00:02:57.299 --> 00:03:02.670
 simply ventilate the keys the cages 

00:03:00.030 --> 00:03:05.040
 of records and then hey we have all 

00:03:02.670 --> 00:03:08.640
 openings for cable management card 

00:03:05.040 --> 00:03:11.190
 mother is obviously all the cable 

00:03:08.640 --> 00:03:12.810
 satin the front face so it goes disassemble 

00:03:11.190 --> 00:03:16.200
 quite easily there are a few 

00:03:12.810 --> 00:03:17.700
 clips what you see an entire mesh 

00:03:16.200 --> 00:03:20.459
 and there is the possibility of putting two 

00:03:17.700 --> 00:03:23.519
 12- year-old fans when we take the 

00:03:20.459 --> 00:03:25.920
 915 m see to a system of a system 

00:03:23.519 --> 00:03:28.500
 of slides it is sweat but 

00:03:25.920 --> 00:03:30.569
 on the slides and bringing it back 

00:03:28.500 --> 00:03:32.250
 forward it locks together 

00:03:30.569 --> 00:03:33.840
 so it's a patented cooler system 

00:03:32.250 --> 00:03:36.109
 master it's beefy 

00:03:33.840 --> 00:03:36.109
 no problem 

00:03:37.400 --> 00:03:41.310
 it does not really worry, but for 

00:03:39.750 --> 00:03:42.870
 those who are still worried there are 

00:03:41.310 --> 00:03:46.379
 enough to put lives that we see the 

00:03:42.870 --> 00:03:49.349
 locations davis there anyway if 

00:03:46.379 --> 00:03:50.819
 we come to install finally available 

00:03:49.349 --> 00:03:52.799
 liquid especially in the upper part 

00:03:50.819 --> 00:03:58.650
 I do not see the point of being able to 

00:03:52.799 --> 00:04:00.120
 move after so the screws are his game 

00:03:58.650 --> 00:04:05.909
 not to say necessary but hey that's 

00:04:00.120 --> 00:04:06.930
 wise it will not bother anyone so the 915 air 

00:04:05.909 --> 00:04:10.980
 which is the element water 

00:04:06.930 --> 00:04:14.280
 on paper it's a chassis me and 

00:04:10.980 --> 00:04:17.039
 normal mini-itx I say of course about the 

00:04:14.280 --> 00:04:19.109
 paper because in reality when we 

00:04:17.039 --> 00:04:21.000
 so there are three extra b's for 

00:04:19.109 --> 00:04:23.729
 discuss three halves and a 5 1 because 

00:04:21.000 --> 00:04:25.620
 when when we add food 

00:04:23.729 --> 00:04:26.460
 so look for laughter ie lime 

00:04:25.620 --> 00:04:29.840
 goes to the back 

00:04:26.460 --> 00:04:33.300
 here when we add the food the 

00:04:29.840 --> 00:04:35.580
 possibilities of 2.2 of the miniter that are 

00:04:33.300 --> 00:04:37.260
 extremely reduced so you see the 

00:04:35.580 --> 00:04:38.970
 communication with the bottom frame 

00:04:37.260 --> 00:04:41.849
 but good when we add this 

00:04:38.970 --> 00:04:43.860
 power there obviously is 

00:04:41.849 --> 00:04:44.880
 found with a fan we can not 

00:04:43.860 --> 00:04:46.979
 put what you want in terms of 

00:04:44.880 --> 00:04:51.780
 fan so that's one of the points 

00:04:46.979 --> 00:04:53.400
 weak dudu of the chassis then point 

00:04:51.780 --> 00:04:57.840
 weak I express myself perhaps a little badly 

00:04:53.400 --> 00:05:00.539
 that is, the only argument 

00:04:57.840 --> 00:05:02.460
 commercial is poorly done actually he 

00:05:00.539 --> 00:05:04.800
 can accommodate mini-itx but in 

00:05:02.460 --> 00:05:06.720
 reality is not really done for that 

00:05:04.800 --> 00:05:08.760
 the entire upper part especially with 

00:05:06.720 --> 00:05:10.229
 all the glue to the communication between 

00:05:08.760 --> 00:05:13.770
 the bottom frame and the top frame 

00:05:10.229 --> 00:05:15.900
 to you see here to my senses takes everything 

00:05:13.770 --> 00:05:17.580
 its interest if one comes to live there 

00:05:15.900 --> 00:05:19.470
 disk is a big system of 

00:05:17.580 --> 00:05:22.590
 liquid cooling on mini-itx 

00:05:19.470 --> 00:05:24.720
 we will be limited we will have a system with 

00:05:22.590 --> 00:05:26.039
 a small fan very little of 

00:05:24.720 --> 00:05:28.919
 cable clearance 

00:05:26.039 --> 00:05:31.020
 so I and then in addition to that all the 

00:05:28.919 --> 00:05:33.360
 bottom system heat that will go up 

00:05:31.020 --> 00:05:35.520
 up so it does not really have any 

00:05:33.360 --> 00:05:37.699
 meaning it's technically possible but 

00:05:35.520 --> 00:05:40.650
 it does not really make sense though 

00:05:37.699 --> 00:05:43.979
 side bays allow 

00:05:40.650 --> 00:05:45.470
 to accommodate big radiators 

00:05:43.979 --> 00:05:47.990
 capacity 

00:05:45.470 --> 00:05:50.840
 big big size 3 x 

00:05:47.990 --> 00:05:53.960
 120 without any problem and it is in this 

00:05:50.840 --> 00:05:56.930
 meaning there you have to see the 935 haf so 

00:05:53.960 --> 00:06:01.160
 the fan when using the 915 

00:05:56.930 --> 00:06:04.220
 why leleu radiator 

00:06:01.160 --> 00:06:07.700
 watercooling gets on on one of 

00:06:04.220 --> 00:06:10.310
 sides and not on the top for the 

00:06:07.700 --> 00:06:13.100
 ventilation of the small bay of three 

00:06:10.310 --> 00:06:15.290
 records there is also a small 

00:06:13.100 --> 00:06:17.060
 fan so it's 92 standard 

00:06:15.290 --> 00:06:19.160
 have that it's a little bit the points 

00:06:17.060 --> 00:06:21.640
 weak of the whole you see in 

00:06:19.160 --> 00:06:24.350
 underneath so there I am under the chassis 

00:06:21.640 --> 00:06:26.810
 main and so we can see that we can 

00:06:24.350 --> 00:06:28.700
 to still house something so the 

00:06:26.810 --> 00:06:30.080
 foot slide system that comes 

00:06:28.700 --> 00:06:33.380
 who is on the slides can 

00:06:30.080 --> 00:06:36.110
 to remove and there we can put 1,915 f 

00:06:33.380 --> 00:06:39.620
 so f for fronte you'll see all this 

00:06:36.110 --> 00:06:41.840
 in the in the web test and there by 

00:06:39.620 --> 00:06:43.640
 against with this chassis there which is a 

00:06:41.840 --> 00:06:45.770
 option that we buy in addition we can 

00:06:43.640 --> 00:06:47.750
 really put a real mini-itx system 

00:06:45.770 --> 00:06:49.700
 with a real graphics card with a 

00:06:47.750 --> 00:06:51.620
 true disciple wrongly since lime and 

00:06:49.700 --> 00:06:54.470
 in front and east where the release to 

00:06:51.620 --> 00:06:56.180
 the back so we end up with a 

00:06:54.470 --> 00:06:58.280
 pretty huge system 

00:06:56.180 --> 00:07:00.110
 so here I put you two videos on 

00:06:58.280 --> 00:07:04.250
 see precisely the possibility 

00:07:00.110 --> 00:07:05.690
 to stack another system in addition so 

00:07:04.250 --> 00:07:08.560
 there it's stacked on top in my opinion 

00:07:05.690 --> 00:07:09.910
 and not really logical 

00:07:08.560 --> 00:07:13.720
 I would put the cooling 

00:07:09.910 --> 00:07:14.980
 liquid in water and the rest down the 

00:07:13.720 --> 00:07:16.600
 mini-itx simply ships for 

00:07:14.980 --> 00:07:18.820
 the circulation of heat so for 

00:07:16.600 --> 00:07:20.350
 conclude very interesting system 

00:07:18.820 --> 00:07:23.410
 I invite you to see the test on 

00:07:20.350 --> 00:07:24.430
 internet is innovative it's not for 

00:07:23.410 --> 00:07:27.100
 everyone because it's still 

00:07:24.430 --> 00:07:27.490
 a little extreme but there are good 

00:07:27.100 --> 00:07:29.320
 ideas 

00:07:27.490 --> 00:07:31.120
 I like it is obviously 

00:07:29.320 --> 00:07:33.550
 modular since this is the whole principle 

00:07:31.120 --> 00:07:34.330
 of the case with a lot of accessories 

00:07:33.550 --> 00:07:36.430
 who will arrive 

00:07:34.330 --> 00:07:37.630
 I put quality of workmanship because 

00:07:36.430 --> 00:07:39.460
 that actually on a case of this 

00:07:37.630 --> 00:07:40.979
 price there is important and we have when 

00:07:39.460 --> 00:07:43.690
 even a good quality of manufacture 

00:07:40.979 --> 00:07:45.729
 in the negative points gmi explained 

00:07:43.690 --> 00:07:48.760
 explanation functions why 

00:07:45.729 --> 00:07:49.870
 basically because of the 915 air that 

00:07:48.760 --> 00:07:52.240
 can be considered a housing 

00:07:49.870 --> 00:07:54.370
 full mini-itx it's not 

00:07:52.240 --> 00:07:57.340
 really the case despite everything for me j'y 

00:07:54.370 --> 00:07:58.600
 put in a bronze medal because 

00:07:57.340 --> 00:07:59.800
 it's still a very good case 

00:07:58.600 --> 00:08:02.290
 exclusive 

00:07:59.800 --> 00:08:04.930
 obviously that I say them look on the 

00:08:02.290 --> 00:08:06.370
 internet test you will understand but 

00:08:04.930 --> 00:08:06.970
 it's a case that counts 

00:08:06.370 --> 00:08:09.660
 original 

00:08:06.970 --> 00:08:09.660
 good here
