dense but it's not I think it don't be
really<00:02:28.910> good<00:02:29.030> collie<00:02:29.240> and<00:02:29.450> even<00:02:29.930> the<00:02:30.020> brushes

00:02:32.220 --> 00:02:32.230 
like are the handle is really nice

00:02:32.230 --> 00:02:36.060 
like are the handle is really nice
quality<00:02:33.230> and<00:02:33.470> it<00:02:33.680> had<00:02:34.010> its<00:02:34.790> the<00:02:34.850> star<00:02:35.150> looks

00:02:36.060 --> 00:02:36.070

quality and it had its the star looks
right<00:02:37.070> there<00:02:37.220> so<00:02:37.400> that's<00:02:37.490> pretty<00:02:37.730> good

00:02:38.490 --> 00:02:38.500

00:03:57.969 --> 00:04:00.569 
this is what this is the most Awkward
farm<00:03:58.569> swatch<00:03:58.930> staying<00:03:59.260> here<00:03:59.620> this<00:04:00.310> is<00:04:00.489> what

00:04:00.569 --> 00:04:00.579 
farm swatch staying here this is what

00:04:00.579 --> 00:04:01.920 
farm swatch staying here this is what
all<00:04:00.760> the<00:04:00.909> colors<00:04:01.150> look<00:04:01.209> like<00:04:01.450> so<00:04:01.659> you<00:04:01.719> can

00:04:01.920 --> 00:04:01.930 
all the colors look like so you can

00:04:01.930 --> 00:04:03.929 
all the colors look like so you can
barely<00:04:02.109> see<00:04:02.349> the<00:04:02.469> gold<00:04:02.709> but<00:04:03.069> I<00:04:03.129> think<00:04:03.400> it<00:04:03.519> but

00:04:03.929 --> 00:04:03.939 
barely see the gold but I think it but

00:04:03.939 --> 00:04:05.809 
barely see the gold but I think it but
you<00:04:04.030> kind<00:04:04.209> of<00:04:04.239> can<00:04:04.420> i<00:04:04.629> have<00:04:04.840> really<00:04:05.079> veiny<00:04:05.379> arms

you kind of can i have really veiny arms

00:04:05.819 --> 00:04:08.339 
you kind of can i have really veiny arms
so<00:04:06.819> that<00:04:06.849> probably<00:04:07.209> doesn't<00:04:07.389> help<00:04:07.569> and<00:04:07.870> then

00:04:08.339 --> 00:04:08.349 
so that probably doesn't help and then

00:04:08.349 --> 00:04:10.530 
so that probably doesn't help and then
the<00:04:08.439> Reds<00:04:08.650> pretty<00:04:09.250> pigmented<00:04:09.519> the<00:04:10.120> blue<00:04:10.329> is

00:05:12.159 --> 00:05:14.520 
July later I guess we'll find it okay so
that's<00:05:12.400> what<00:05:12.550> it<00:05:12.580> looks<00:05:12.789> like<00:05:12.970> I<00:05:13.470> don't<00:05:14.470> know

00:05:14.520 --> 00:05:14.530 
that's what it looks like I don't know

00:05:14.530 --> 00:05:19.140 
that's what it looks like I don't know
my<00:05:14.650> hand<00:05:15.479> yeah<00:05:16.590> that's<00:05:17.590> really<00:05:17.770> pretty<00:05:18.150> never

00:05:19.140 --> 00:05:19.150 
my hand yeah that's really pretty never

00:05:19.150 --> 00:05:21.510 
my hand yeah that's really pretty never
I<00:05:19.240> didn't<00:05:19.479> think<00:05:19.599> of<00:05:19.720> like<00:05:20.190> bluish<00:05:21.190> colors

00:05:21.510 --> 00:05:21.520 
I didn't think of like bluish colors

00:05:21.520 --> 00:05:23.100 
I didn't think of like bluish colors
always<00:05:21.669> think<00:05:21.909> of<00:05:22.000> the<00:05:22.030> summer<00:05:22.330> but<00:05:22.659> I<00:05:22.870> think

00:05:23.100 --> 00:05:23.110 
always think of the summer but I think

00:05:23.110 --> 00:05:25.290 
always think of the summer but I think
you<00:05:23.440> could<00:05:23.560> do<00:05:23.710> season<00:05:24.070> the<00:05:24.669> winter<00:05:24.940> too<00:05:25.090> I

00:05:25.290 --> 00:05:25.300 
you could do season the winter too I

00:05:25.300 --> 00:05:26.640 
you could do season the winter too I
don't<00:05:25.690> know<00:05:25.750> I<00:05:25.780> think<00:05:25.960> this<00:05:26.289> is<00:05:26.440> a<00:05:26.470> really

00:05:26.640 --> 00:05:26.650 
don't know I think this is a really

00:05:26.650 --> 00:05:28.409 
don't know I think this is a really
pretty<00:05:27.190> gel<00:05:27.460> eyeliner<00:05:27.820> and<00:05:28.000> I'm<00:05:28.090> not<00:05:28.210> really

00:05:28.409 --> 00:05:28.419 
pretty gel eyeliner and I'm not really

00:05:28.419 --> 00:05:30.990 
pretty gel eyeliner and I'm not really
big<00:05:28.720> into<00:05:29.500> gel<00:05:29.830> eyeliners<00:05:30.340> but<00:05:30.520> I<00:05:30.550> think<00:05:30.789> it'll

00:05:30.990 --> 00:05:31.000 
big into gel eyeliners but I think it'll

00:05:31.000 --> 00:05:33.420 
big into gel eyeliners but I think it'll
be<00:05:31.030> a<00:05:31.389> good<00:05:31.919> thing<00:05:32.919> to<00:05:32.979> add<00:05:33.190> to<00:05:33.219> my<00:05:33.310> collection

00:05:33.420 --> 00:05:33.430 
be a good thing to add to my collection

00:05:33.430 --> 00:05:35.640 
be a good thing to add to my collection
and<00:05:34.120> that's<00:05:34.690> the<00:05:34.810> name<00:05:34.960> of<00:05:34.990> it<00:05:35.169> there<00:05:35.349> I'm<00:05:35.530> not

00:05:35.640 --> 00:05:35.650 
and that's the name of it there I'm not

00:05:35.650 --> 00:05:36.719 
and that's the name of it there I'm not
going<00:05:35.800> to<00:05:35.860> try<00:05:36.009> and<00:05:36.070> pronounce<00:05:36.250> that<00:05:36.550> though

00:05:36.719 --> 00:05:36.729 
going to try and pronounce that though

00:05:36.729 --> 00:05:38.700 
going to try and pronounce that though
so<00:05:37.630> those<00:05:37.780> are<00:05:37.960> the<00:05:38.020> four<00:05:38.080> products<00:05:38.560> that<00:05:38.650> i
