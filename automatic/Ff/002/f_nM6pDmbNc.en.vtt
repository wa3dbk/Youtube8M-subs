00:00:07.940 --> 00:00:13.440
 those are fans of the two wheels of 

00:00:10.589 --> 00:00:15.389
 the adrenaline and because they are not the 

00:00:13.440 --> 00:00:17.369
 next to become more than happy 

00:00:15.389 --> 00:00:19.560
 because they are going to inaugurate a track 

00:00:17.369 --> 00:00:21.000
 bikers special in jump I 'm going to 

00:00:19.560 --> 00:00:22.500
 present a group of guys who are 

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:24.630
 making history in our province 

00:00:22.500 --> 00:00:27.470
 because they are the pioneers in bringing this 

00:00:24.630 --> 00:00:27.470
 forward sport 

00:00:43.449 --> 00:00:49.670
 very good my name is frank 

00:00:47.270 --> 00:00:52.520
 I am one of the babies and ryder from here 

00:00:49.670 --> 00:00:55.520
 jumps we form more or less the part of 

00:00:52.520 --> 00:00:58.490
 the bmx organization 

00:00:55.520 --> 00:01:02.410
 what it really is is an extreme sport 

00:00:58.490 --> 00:01:05.840
 that a bicycle is used 20 

00:01:02.410 --> 00:01:08.520
 as many will see it are visible from 

00:01:05.840 --> 00:01:10.920
 little ones would say some but 

00:01:08.520 --> 00:01:13.380
 us our point of view in a 

00:01:10.920 --> 00:01:16.229
 rolled 20 for us is something like 

00:01:13.380 --> 00:01:17.939
 saying with this is clear that bike is 

00:01:16.229 --> 00:01:21.869
 you can fly with that service you can 

00:01:17.939 --> 00:01:25.979
 do pirouettes twists and combinations of 

00:01:21.869 --> 00:01:29.039
 tricks you can run the adrenaline 

00:01:25.979 --> 00:01:32.240
 in the body and generate a lot of joy in 

00:01:29.039 --> 00:01:32.240
 every trick that one does 

00:01:45.420 --> 00:01:51.759
 and the jumping move 

00:01:48.490 --> 00:01:53.679
 year after year it is growing very much already 

00:01:51.759 --> 00:01:55.869
 We are becoming more than 200 boys 

00:01:53.679 --> 00:01:58.569
 who are cycling, that's why 

00:01:55.869 --> 00:02:00.670
 we have fought for this army that 

00:01:58.569 --> 00:02:03.819
 it's pretty cool 

00:02:00.670 --> 00:02:06.850
 this sport something is something is something 

00:02:03.819 --> 00:02:09.819
 complicated is a new sport that in the 

00:02:06.850 --> 00:02:12.190
 society is just starting to 

00:02:09.819 --> 00:02:15.810
 take is approximately 50 years old 

00:02:12.190 --> 00:02:19.050
 then it is not something is not something simple 

00:02:15.810 --> 00:02:21.360
 the sport is not only 

00:02:19.050 --> 00:02:23.790
 It's not just when you get on the bike and 

00:02:21.360 --> 00:02:26.070
 do the tests when I started to walk 

00:02:23.790 --> 00:02:27.990
 on a bike, I started to go out a lot 

00:02:26.070 --> 00:02:30.960
 street began to know a lot of 

00:02:27.990 --> 00:02:33.630
 people began to travel began to see 

00:02:30.960 --> 00:02:35.900
 that things are different before 

00:02:33.630 --> 00:02:38.640
 have lots of friends who share 

00:02:35.900 --> 00:02:41.430
 they share the same as you, the truth that 

00:02:38.640 --> 00:02:43.680
 it's a sport that implies that explains 

00:02:41.430 --> 00:02:45.450
 a lot of love is not something that I can 

00:02:43.680 --> 00:02:48.210
 Do only weekends 

00:02:45.450 --> 00:02:50.730
 it takes a long time to practice and 

00:02:48.210 --> 00:02:53.550
 have to put a lot of effort the subject of 

00:02:50.730 --> 00:02:56.990
 have to collect the coins to pay 

00:02:53.550 --> 00:03:01.430
 the bike is quite complicated but it is 

00:02:56.990 --> 00:03:01.430
 it's something that does not change for nothing 

00:03:18.770 --> 00:03:25.510
 in particular for me 

00:03:21.880 --> 00:03:29.550
 the anecdote and the best that could have 

00:03:25.510 --> 00:03:29.550
 spent in this sport 

00:03:29.980 --> 00:03:34.810
 in general when you download a new test 

00:03:32.230 --> 00:03:37.690
 and that impulse that your friends give you for 

00:03:34.810 --> 00:03:40.450
 get something new out of a new test that 

00:03:37.690 --> 00:03:42.849
 is the best and the same in a championship 

00:03:40.450 --> 00:03:45.000
 when you dare to do and take out a 

00:03:42.849 --> 00:03:48.000
 egg during a championship 

00:03:45.000 --> 00:03:49.260
 it is inexplicable deformity of the 

00:03:48.000 --> 00:03:51.000
 sensations in reality this 

00:03:49.260 --> 00:03:53.700
 It is generally a sport for men 

00:03:51.000 --> 00:03:55.530
 but good is like saying I'm here 

00:03:53.700 --> 00:03:57.100
 how to say the girls can also 

00:03:55.530 --> 00:03:59.680
 understand 

00:03:57.100 --> 00:04:02.290
 and the feminine touch and it 's depends that 

00:03:59.680 --> 00:04:05.560
 each one has his way of walking in my 

00:04:02.290 --> 00:04:08.800
 case I am how can I be engaged in walking 

00:04:05.560 --> 00:04:11.890
 I take care of everything to be women as well as 

00:04:08.800 --> 00:04:16.989
 also for later breaking on the track 

00:04:11.890 --> 00:04:18.850
 I put all the gross to all and all 

00:04:16.989 --> 00:04:21.190
 the girls say that they see him jumping 

00:04:18.850 --> 00:04:24.250
 the guys who do trick one thing do not 

00:04:21.190 --> 00:04:25.810
 There is complicated I do it in Jal - deal 

00:04:24.250 --> 00:04:29.340
 this 

00:04:25.810 --> 00:04:33.250
 You can really fall to hurt 

00:04:29.340 --> 00:04:36.180
 but with adequate protection there is no 

00:04:33.250 --> 00:04:36.180
 water problem 

00:04:48.720 --> 00:04:55.040
 for all the people not only male in 

00:04:52.300 --> 00:04:56.870
 males also girls 

00:04:55.040 --> 00:05:00.770
 those who call your attention in this 

00:04:56.870 --> 00:05:03.170
 sport and want to get closer are more 

00:05:00.770 --> 00:05:07.160
 that you are going to be very welcome 

00:05:03.170 --> 00:05:09.800
 because one even though he feels or 

00:05:07.160 --> 00:05:12.950
 think about the refusal to say this is not 

00:05:09.800 --> 00:05:15.260
 I can not do this sport is 

00:05:12.950 --> 00:05:18.020
 wrong because we were not born knowing 

00:05:15.260 --> 00:05:19.760
 this sport we come each 

00:05:18.020 --> 00:05:22.330
 with your bike 

00:05:19.760 --> 00:05:24.950
 and it was that friend who came and told you 

00:05:22.330 --> 00:05:28.250
 started to try this started to prove that 

00:05:24.950 --> 00:05:31.760
 they start to cheer you start 

00:05:28.250 --> 00:05:35.000
 reveal and you realize that you love the 

00:05:31.760 --> 00:05:39.500
 sport and the channel every day makes you want 

00:05:35.000 --> 00:05:41.420
 to walk much better to professionalize yourself 

00:05:39.500 --> 00:05:43.880
 if possible 

00:05:41.420 --> 00:05:47.600
 and not to mention travel the trip of 

00:05:43.880 --> 00:05:50.210
 friends with the bicycle in the bag are 

00:05:47.600 --> 00:05:53.570
 the best and they receive you from the best 

00:05:50.210 --> 00:05:57.470
 way so that they hold you in their 

00:05:53.570 --> 00:06:00.260
 houses and they receive as if it were a 

00:05:57.470 --> 00:06:03.530
 idol for them and the truth that the 

00:06:00.260 --> 00:06:05.710
 friendship that is in the baby that is what 

00:06:03.530 --> 00:06:05.710
 best 

00:06:13.320 --> 00:06:16.320
 you
