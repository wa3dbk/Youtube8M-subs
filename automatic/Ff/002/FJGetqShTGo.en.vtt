 blessing for the people with whom

00:01:10.929 --> 00:01:16.820
 will recognize the blessing that comes to me 

00:01:13.780 --> 00:01:19.760
 encounter in each person

00:01:25.130 --> 00:01:32.650
 father son and holy spirit 

00:01:29.900 --> 00:01:32.650
 Amen 

00:01:32.750 --> 00:01:40.470
 four milks of God's blessing 

00:01:36.330 --> 00:01:44.340
 I will bless you and in you the 

00:01:40.470 --> 00:01:47.310
 families of the earth genesis chapter 

00:01:44.340 --> 00:01:50.610
 12 verse 2 

00:01:47.310 --> 00:01:53.670
 when God now threw down the path in 

00:01:50.610 --> 00:01:55.740
 the one who would fulfill his destiny sends it 

00:01:53.670 --> 00:01:58.700
 from his parents' house 

00:01:55.740 --> 00:02:02.240
 to an unknown territory 

00:01:58.700 --> 00:02:05.360
 no doubt his excitement about the future 

00:02:02.240 --> 00:02:09.000
 it was mixed with a considerable 

00:02:05.360 --> 00:02:11.910
 restlessness about what was ahead 

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:16.320
 the same concern that we feel the 

00:02:11.910 --> 00:02:20.580
 most of us about how it will be 

00:02:16.320 --> 00:02:23.840
 our future in the call that God 

00:02:20.580 --> 00:02:26.840
 is making us 

00:02:23.840 --> 00:02:31.040
 God makes a promise to brand him and 

00:02:26.840 --> 00:02:34.340
 says that he would receive his blessing and 

00:02:31.040 --> 00:02:36.790
 would be converted into blessing is for 

00:02:34.340 --> 00:02:40.430
 this that throughout our life 

00:02:36.790 --> 00:02:43.750
 we must keep in mind the four laws 

00:02:40.430 --> 00:02:43.750
 of the blessing 

00:02:44.630 --> 00:02:52.580
 first in him 

00:02:47.069 --> 00:02:55.430
 our blessings must flow to others 

00:02:52.580 --> 00:02:58.250
 the bible teaches us that when we are 

00:02:55.430 --> 00:03:01.580
 blessed is not only for us 

00:02:58.250 --> 00:03:05.060
 we feel very happy and comfortable 

00:03:01.580 --> 00:03:09.230
 but for us to bless others when 

00:03:05.060 --> 00:03:10.310
 god blessed brand in genesis 2 and it 

00:03:09.230 --> 00:03:13.790
 He said 

00:03:10.310 --> 00:03:15.569
 I will bless you and you will serve as a blessing 

00:03:13.790 --> 00:03:19.019
 to others 

00:03:15.569 --> 00:03:22.890
 this is the first law of blessing and 

00:03:19.019 --> 00:03:26.610
 is that the blessing must flow 

00:03:22.890 --> 00:03:30.690
 second law when we bless 

00:03:26.610 --> 00:03:32.900
 other gods will take care of our 

00:03:30.690 --> 00:03:32.900
 needs 

00:03:32.930 --> 00:03:39.469
 that promises him god he will take care of 

00:03:36.349 --> 00:03:43.990
 our needs there is nothing 

00:03:39.469 --> 00:03:46.320
 God will not do for others 

00:03:43.990 --> 00:03:50.650
 in fact god guarantees this blessing 

00:03:46.320 --> 00:03:53.890
 in the gospel of Luke 18 says them 

00:03:50.650 --> 00:03:55.590
 I guarantee this who gives something to 

00:03:53.890 --> 00:03:58.840
 God's kingdom 

00:03:55.590 --> 00:03:59.960
 you will certainly receive many times more in 

00:03:58.840 --> 00:04:03.770
 this life 

00:03:59.960 --> 00:04:05.780
 and eternal life in the whole world 

00:04:03.770 --> 00:04:07.220
 when we care for 

00:04:05.780 --> 00:04:08.960
 help others 

00:04:07.220 --> 00:04:11.570
 God takes responsibility for 

00:04:08.960 --> 00:04:13.330
 our problems and that's a 

00:04:11.570 --> 00:04:15.430
 royal blessing 

00:04:13.330 --> 00:04:18.250
 because he knows how to handle our 

00:04:15.430 --> 00:04:20.700
 difficulties more than we 

00:04:18.250 --> 00:04:23.870
 we can 

00:04:20.700 --> 00:04:27.660
 third law our blessings 

00:04:23.870 --> 00:04:29.500
 shared with others return to 

00:04:27.660 --> 00:04:32.560
 we 

00:04:29.500 --> 00:04:36.490
 the more you bless others while 

00:04:32.560 --> 00:04:39.670
 more helps others more blessings of 

00:04:36.490 --> 00:04:41.980
 god come on you 

00:04:39.670 --> 00:04:46.900
 in the gospel of Lucas 

00:04:41.980 --> 00:04:48.150
 chapter 6 verse 38 says that and it 

00:04:46.900 --> 00:04:50.840
 will give you 

00:04:48.150 --> 00:04:53.030
 good measure 

00:04:50.840 --> 00:04:56.389
 here tells us not just us 

00:04:53.030 --> 00:04:58.240
 true the return but with bonus extra and 

00:04:56.389 --> 00:05:00.569
 Blessings 

00:04:58.240 --> 00:05:03.430
 we can not beat God 

00:05:00.569 --> 00:05:06.550
 the more we try to bless 

00:05:03.430 --> 00:05:08.249
 others around our god then 

00:05:06.550 --> 00:05:12.550
 they will say 

00:05:08.249 --> 00:05:15.400
 I will pour more blessings on you 

00:05:12.550 --> 00:05:19.690
 let's play a little game 

00:05:15.400 --> 00:05:23.020
 let's see who gives more while 

00:05:19.690 --> 00:05:27.160
 you bless others I will take care of 

00:05:23.020 --> 00:05:30.610
 return on you the blessing 

00:05:27.160 --> 00:05:33.970
 fourth law when God returns the 

00:05:30.610 --> 00:05:37.680
 blessing god expects that from it 

00:05:33.970 --> 00:05:41.190
 way you bless others again 

00:05:37.680 --> 00:05:44.850
 jesus said in the gospel of lucas 

00:05:41.190 --> 00:05:48.910
 chapter 12 that to whom much is given 

00:05:44.850 --> 00:05:52.409
 much is required when receiving from God 

00:05:48.910 --> 00:05:55.199
 our responsibility is bigger 

00:05:52.409 --> 00:05:56.910
 based on the blessings that you have already 

00:05:55.199 --> 00:05:59.880
 received until today 

00:05:56.910 --> 00:06:01.580
 what do you think god is expected 

00:05:59.880 --> 00:06:05.000
 of you 

00:06:01.580 --> 00:06:07.270
 what do you think the god expects 

00:06:05.000 --> 00:06:07.270
 of us 

00:06:08.750 --> 00:06:15.500
 live a life in service attitude 

00:06:12.730 --> 00:06:20.290
 blessing our neighbor we 

00:06:15.500 --> 00:06:20.290
 we bless ourselves 

00:06:20.569 --> 00:06:26.610
 glory to father glory child and glory to 

00:06:24.830 --> 00:06:29.870
