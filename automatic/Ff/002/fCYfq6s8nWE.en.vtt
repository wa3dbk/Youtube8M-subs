with<00:00:36.210> you<00:00:36.329> but<00:00:36.480> the<00:00:36.630> few<00:00:36.840> of<00:00:36.870> us<00:00:37.079> that<00:00:37.140> are<00:00:38.040> I

00:00:38.950 --> 00:00:38.960 
with you but the few of us that are I

with you but the few of us that are I
don't<00:00:39.960> know<00:00:40.430> linux<00:00:41.430> people<00:00:41.850> is<00:00:42.750> not<00:00:42.960> really<00:00:43.230> a

00:00:43.250 --> 00:00:43.260 
don't know linux people is not really a

00:00:43.260 --> 00:00:47.000 
don't know linux people is not really a
name<00:00:43.530> but<00:00:44.160> linux<00:00:44.610> people<00:00:45.590> like<00:00:46.590> to<00:00:46.739> play<00:00:46.890> the

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:47.010 
name but linux people like to play the

00:00:47.010 --> 00:00:48.500 
name but linux people like to play the
game<00:00:47.129> as<00:00:47.280> well<00:00:47.399> and<00:00:47.760> because<00:00:48.030> it's<00:00:48.180> a<00:00:48.270> java

00:00:48.500 --> 00:00:48.510 
game as well and because it's a java

00:00:48.510 --> 00:00:50.959 
game as well and because it's a java
game<00:00:48.780> its<00:00:49.110> operating<00:00:49.920> system<00:00:50.219> agnostic<00:00:50.789> which

00:00:50.959 --> 00:00:50.969 
game its operating system agnostic which

00:00:50.969 --> 00:00:53.959 
game its operating system agnostic which
is<00:00:51.149> perfect<00:00:51.949> so<00:00:52.949> we<00:00:53.250> don't<00:00:53.460> really<00:00:53.640> have<00:00:53.879> to

00:00:53.959 --> 00:00:53.969 
is perfect so we don't really have to

00:00:53.969 --> 00:00:56.119 
is perfect so we don't really have to
worry<00:00:54.000> about<00:00:54.239> that<00:00:54.539> but<00:00:54.829> apparently<00:00:55.829> we<00:00:55.980> do

00:00:56.119 --> 00:00:56.129 
worry about that but apparently we do

00:00:56.129 --> 00:00:58.369 
worry about that but apparently we do
because<00:00:56.579> minecraft<00:00:57.120> itself<00:00:57.539> to<00:00:57.750> will<00:00:57.960> not<00:00:58.170> run

00:00:58.369 --> 00:00:58.379 
because minecraft itself to will not run

00:00:58.379 --> 00:01:02.360 
because minecraft itself to will not run

believe now this is applied to the
Oracles<00:01:06.540> java<00:01:07.140> I'm<00:01:07.560> not<00:01:08.130> so<00:01:08.340> sure<00:01:08.369> about<00:01:08.729> the

00:01:09.410 --> 00:01:09.420 
Oracles java I'm not so sure about the

00:01:09.420 --> 00:01:15.910 
Oracles java I'm not so sure about the
OpenJDK<00:01:10.350> but<00:01:10.680> I<00:01:11.090> think<00:01:12.090> I<00:01:12.270> saw<00:01:13.100> different

00:01:15.910 --> 00:01:15.920 
OpenJDK but I think I saw different

00:01:15.920 --> 00:01:19.999 
OpenJDK but I think I saw different
error<00:01:16.920> reports<00:01:17.790> about<00:01:18.780> OpenJDK<00:01:19.590> having<00:01:19.890> the

00:01:19.999 --> 00:01:20.009 
error reports about OpenJDK having the

00:01:20.009 --> 00:01:22.730 
error reports about OpenJDK having the
same<00:01:20.159> problem<00:01:20.390> so<00:01:21.390> it's<00:01:21.659> more<00:01:21.840> of<00:01:22.020> minecraft

00:01:22.730 --> 00:01:22.740 
same problem so it's more of minecraft

00:01:22.740 --> 00:01:26.719 
same problem so it's more of minecraft
problem<00:01:23.189> than<00:01:23.400> it<00:01:23.520> is<00:01:23.640> javis<00:01:24.030> problem<00:01:25.009> so<00:01:26.009> the

00:01:26.719 --> 00:01:26.729 
problem than it is javis problem so the

00:01:26.729 --> 00:01:28.310 
problem than it is javis problem so the
main<00:01:26.880> problem<00:01:27.240> that<00:01:27.390> people<00:01:27.509> are<00:01:27.720> having<00:01:27.869> and

00:01:28.310 --> 00:01:28.320 
main problem that people are having and

00:01:28.320 --> 00:01:29.810 
main problem that people are having and
I'll<00:01:28.590> try<00:01:28.740> to<00:01:28.770> demonstrate<00:01:28.979> it<00:01:29.460> here<00:01:29.640> if<00:01:29.729> it

00:01:29.810 --> 00:01:29.820 
I'll try to demonstrate it here if it

00:01:29.820 --> 00:01:32.950 
I'll try to demonstrate it here if it
works<00:01:30.030> so<00:01:30.329> I'm<00:01:30.600> going<00:01:30.720> to<00:01:30.780> change<00:01:31.520> directories

00:01:32.950 --> 00:01:32.960 
works so I'm going to change directories

00:01:32.960 --> 00:01:37.490 
works so I'm going to change directories
directories<00:01:33.960> and<00:01:35.689> so<00:01:36.689> this<00:01:36.930> is<00:01:37.079> how<00:01:37.200> you<00:01:37.229> would

00:01:37.490 --> 00:01:37.500 
directories and so this is how you would

00:01:37.500 --> 00:01:39.440 
directories and so this is how you would
launch<00:01:37.890> the<00:01:38.040> game<00:01:38.189> itself<00:01:38.579> so<00:01:38.700> Java<00:01:39.060> attacked

00:01:39.440 --> 00:01:39.450 
launch the game itself so Java attacked

00:01:39.450 --> 00:01:42.980 
launch the game itself so Java attacked

00:06:23.400 --> 00:06:25.590 
little wonky dependent even in windows
like<00:06:24.000> a<00:06:24.030> stable<00:06:24.510> environment

00:06:25.590 --> 00:06:25.600

I<00:06:26.820> don't<00:06:27.820> know<00:06:27.910> I<00:06:28.180> think<00:06:28.990> it's<00:06:29.110> mainly<00:06:29.320> the

00:06:29.490 --> 00:06:29.500 
I don't know I think it's mainly the

00:06:29.500 --> 00:06:33.210 
I don't know I think it's mainly the
language<00:06:29.980> that<00:06:30.160> it's<00:06:30.370> used<00:06:31.320> so<00:06:32.320> the<00:06:32.710> downside

00:06:33.210 --> 00:06:33.220 
language that it's used so the downside

00:06:33.220 --> 00:06:35.520 
language that it's used so the downside
to<00:06:33.370> doing<00:06:33.400> this<00:06:33.820> is<00:06:34.180> that<00:06:34.780> you<00:06:34.990> have<00:06:35.230> to<00:06:35.410> do

00:06:35.520 --> 00:06:35.530 
to doing this is that you have to do

00:06:35.530 --> 00:06:38.430 
to doing this is that you have to do
this<00:06:35.560> every<00:06:35.890> single<00:06:36.600> update<00:06:37.600> so<00:06:37.990> right<00:06:38.410> now

00:06:38.430 --> 00:06:38.440 
this every single update so right now

00:06:38.440 --> 00:06:42.120 
this every single update so right now
it's<00:06:38.800> minecraft<00:06:39.250> 1.4<00:06:40.180> point<00:06:40.570> seven<00:06:41.020> when<00:06:41.920> that

00:06:42.120 --> 00:06:42.130 
it's minecraft 1.4 point seven when that

00:06:42.130 --> 00:06:44.280 
it's minecraft 1.4 point seven when that
becomes<00:06:42.520> 1.5<00:06:43.360> or<00:06:43.570> one<00:06:43.720> point<00:06:44.020> four<00:06:44.260> point

00:06:44.280 --> 00:06:44.290 
becomes 1.5 or one point four point

00:06:44.290 --> 00:06:46.710
