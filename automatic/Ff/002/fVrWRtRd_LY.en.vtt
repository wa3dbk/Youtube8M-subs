00:00:13.969 --> 00:00:26.680
 He offered a wind farm with 48 wendy 

00:00:22.470 --> 00:00:29.840
 Winters is like helping you struck 

00:00:26.680 --> 00:00:35.809
 you need something very special to build 

00:00:29.840 --> 00:00:38.809
 and many people klinikum we look 

00:00:35.809 --> 00:00:41.270
 to them as they wind up the wind wheels 

00:00:38.809 --> 00:00:49.300
 skiing or with the pool 

00:00:41.270 --> 00:00:49.300
 find helicopters and what they work for 

00:01:04.010 --> 00:01:08.460
 my name is jörg müller i am 

00:01:06.150 --> 00:01:11.190
 responsible for the installation of the 

00:01:08.460 --> 00:01:13.080
 entire wind farms at the moment we are in 

00:01:11.190 --> 00:01:14.760
 the first phase of the installation we 

00:01:13.080 --> 00:01:17.400
 install foundations for the 

00:01:14.760 --> 00:01:20.040
 foundations weigh over 500 tons and 

00:01:17.400 --> 00:01:20.880
 each with four nails in the ground 

00:01:20.040 --> 00:01:22.380
 arrested 

00:01:20.880 --> 00:01:24.540
 you have to imagine the nail 

00:01:22.380 --> 00:01:26.340
 alone is not already over 100 tons 

00:01:24.540 --> 00:01:28.610
 50 meters long just under three meters 

00:01:26.340 --> 00:01:28.610
 diameter 

00:01:43.760 --> 00:01:49.800
 müller i am used as site supervisor 

00:01:46.350 --> 00:01:52.890
 in the project of a notary in the army 

00:01:49.800 --> 00:01:55.440
 I'm almost there for two years and there 

00:01:52.890 --> 00:01:57.480
 many office workers are ready to go 

00:01:55.440 --> 00:02:00.600
 but sit down quickly yes it is good 

00:01:57.480 --> 00:02:02.640
 that now comes in the way to 

00:02:00.600 --> 00:02:04.980
 core business again because it's what's going 

00:02:02.640 --> 00:02:09.020
 and i'm still afraid of paper and that 

00:02:04.980 --> 00:02:09.020
 that we actually feel here 

00:02:27.130 --> 00:02:31.550
 my name is forster i am motto 

00:02:30.020 --> 00:02:34.820
 construction manager so I am 

00:02:31.550 --> 00:02:38.990
 Construction supervisor for the installation, so to speak 

00:02:34.820 --> 00:02:41.150
 the wind turbines are there in 

00:02:38.990 --> 00:02:43.790
 three out there also more that eventually 

00:02:41.150 --> 00:02:46.700
 the forces of nature quite different wave 

00:02:43.790 --> 00:02:48.820
 wind and current all that 

00:02:46.700 --> 00:02:51.080
 Installation definitely influences 

00:02:48.820 --> 00:02:54.110
 These twelve- hour shifts request 

00:02:51.080 --> 00:02:57.940
 then you realize after 14 days that 

00:02:54.110 --> 00:02:57.940
 the battery is so slowly empty 

00:03:06.260 --> 00:03:13.020
 my name is sabine fox me for one 

00:03:09.330 --> 00:03:15.660
 Head of marine coordination only in 

00:03:13.020 --> 00:03:19.080
 a suitable weather window 

00:03:15.660 --> 00:03:19.860
 So we do all these things 

00:03:19.080 --> 00:03:21.930
 change of course 

00:03:19.860 --> 00:03:24.960
 the install and also in the harbor 

00:03:21.930 --> 00:03:26.640
 work also limits the when we 

00:03:24.960 --> 00:03:29.660
 strong winds then we can not 

00:03:26.640 --> 00:03:29.660
 load jackets 

00:03:34.130 --> 00:03:38.540
 my name is markus decker I am 

00:03:36.590 --> 00:03:40.340
 her bremerhaven as the deepest 

00:03:38.540 --> 00:03:42.650
 used and then take care of me here 

00:03:40.340 --> 00:03:44.960
 the logistics we started here 

00:03:42.650 --> 00:03:47.180
 with a sheer clear area and 

00:03:44.960 --> 00:03:49.400
 had to work everything out for us that is 

00:03:47.180 --> 00:03:52.570
 on the one hand, stressful 

00:03:49.400 --> 00:03:52.570
 one side of course makes it fun 

00:03:58.130 --> 00:04:02.750
 I have the feeling that we are 

00:04:00.680 --> 00:04:05.150
 do the right thing and do gas for the environment 

00:04:02.750 --> 00:04:06.620
 makes me too proud so I think 

00:04:05.150 --> 00:04:08.840
 It's great if I can tell you 

00:04:06.620 --> 00:04:11.710
 need wind turbines more on that 

00:04:08.840 --> 00:04:11.710
 is already a good feeling 

00:04:19.800 --> 00:04:25.750
 see the next movie like life 

00:04:23.200 --> 00:04:29.520
 on the ships and how the whole though 

00:04:25.750 --> 00:04:29.520
 as the ships of korea
