00:00:00.640 --> 00:00:09.079
 Hi, I'm here to show you a 

00:00:05.180 --> 00:00:14.629
 little of the launch of a sony 

00:00:09.079 --> 00:00:17.269
 magnetic launch that sheik 99 

00:00:14.629 --> 00:00:22.009
 is a relatively relative sound 

00:00:17.269 --> 00:00:26.560
 expensive but omnipotent technology 

00:00:22.009 --> 00:00:30.140
 sony decided to finally release a sound that 

00:00:26.560 --> 00:00:32.060
 meets some people who like to have 

00:00:30.140 --> 00:00:35.899
 power 

00:00:32.060 --> 00:00:39.350
 how I had a dream on the side but how 

00:00:35.899 --> 00:00:43.449
 I live in an apartment in the matter of 

00:00:39.350 --> 00:00:47.750
 space is paramount when it comes to 

00:00:43.449 --> 00:00:51.260
 buy this sound because it unites several 

00:00:47.750 --> 00:00:52.760
 technologies and the sound is very good 

00:00:51.260 --> 00:00:55.629
 good 

00:00:52.760 --> 00:00:55.629
 I have nothing to complain about. 

00:00:55.850 --> 00:01:03.140
 sony claims to have four thousand watts of 

00:00:58.820 --> 00:01:08.540
 power may be a little close to that. 

00:01:03.140 --> 00:01:13.310
 but I do not believe it has 14,000 

00:01:08.540 --> 00:01:16.160
 fact but I guarantee the sound is very 

00:01:13.310 --> 00:01:19.880
 very important at the moment 

00:01:16.160 --> 00:01:22.670
 connected to the 2-hour 

00:01:19.880 --> 00:01:25.909

 girls apps that most match 

00:02:27.980 --> 00:02:33.640
 that sounds are the applications that 

00:02:30.620 --> 00:02:40.370
