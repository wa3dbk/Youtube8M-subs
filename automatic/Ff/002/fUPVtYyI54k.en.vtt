really bad like little sticker things
which<00:02:01.960> I'm<00:02:02.110> assuming<00:02:02.229> is<00:02:02.680> the<00:02:02.830> case<00:02:03.040> to<00:02:03.549> be

00:02:03.660 --> 00:02:03.670 
which I'm assuming is the case to be

00:02:03.670 --> 00:02:06.719 
which I'm assuming is the case to be
honest<00:02:03.850> with<00:02:04.000> this<00:02:04.380> but<00:02:05.380> yeah<00:02:05.530> as<00:02:05.799> I<00:02:06.009> say<00:02:06.250> they

00:02:06.719 --> 00:02:06.729 
honest with this but yeah as I say they

00:02:06.729 --> 00:02:10.650 
honest with this but yeah as I say they
move<00:02:07.000> around<00:02:07.470> and<00:02:08.520> I<00:02:09.520> just<00:02:10.149> can't<00:02:10.390> see<00:02:10.630> it

00:02:10.650 --> 00:02:10.660 
move around and I just can't see it

00:02:10.660 --> 00:02:13.350 
move around and I just can't see it
lasting<00:02:11.140> very<00:02:11.319> long<00:02:11.470> at<00:02:11.860> all<00:02:12.130> I<00:02:12.459> mean<00:02:13.120> I've<00:02:13.239> had

00:02:13.350 --> 00:02:13.360 
lasting very long at all I mean I've had

00:02:13.360 --> 00:02:15.059 
lasting very long at all I mean I've had
it<00:02:13.510> in<00:02:13.600> my<00:02:13.720> hand<00:02:13.930> for<00:02:14.110> like<00:02:14.200> five<00:02:14.500> minutes<00:02:14.800> and

00:02:15.059 --> 00:02:15.069 
it in my hand for like five minutes and

00:02:15.069 --> 00:02:17.570 
it in my hand for like five minutes and
already<00:02:15.400> like<00:02:15.910> the<00:02:16.300> gems<00:02:16.569> are<00:02:16.780> falling<00:02:17.110> off

00:02:17.570 --> 00:02:17.580 
already like the gems are falling off

00:02:17.580 --> 00:02:22.199 
already like the gems are falling off
I'm<00:02:18.580> not<00:02:18.880> very<00:02:19.030> pleased<00:02:20.430> it<00:02:21.430> looks<00:02:21.940> really
