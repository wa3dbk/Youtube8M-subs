what I like to do I like to streak even
though<00:00:16.619> this<00:00:16.770> is<00:00:16.920> a<00:00:16.949> little<00:00:17.160> bit<00:00:17.279> more<00:00:17.400> rush

00:00:17.689 --> 00:00:17.699 
though this is a little bit more rush

00:00:17.699 --> 00:00:19.400 
though this is a little bit more rush
looking<00:00:18.240> gameplay<00:00:18.660> this<00:00:18.869> is<00:00:18.990> basically<00:00:19.289> the

00:00:19.400 --> 00:00:19.410 
looking gameplay this is basically the

00:00:19.410 --> 00:00:25.099 
looking gameplay this is basically the
same<00:00:20.330> kind<00:00:21.330> of<00:00:23.150> thing<00:00:24.150> i<00:00:24.300> did<00:00:24.480> on<00:00:24.600> the<00:00:24.689> 19<00:00:25.080> I

00:00:25.099 --> 00:00:25.109 
same kind of thing i did on the 19 I

00:00:25.109 --> 00:00:28.070 
same kind of thing i did on the 19 I
know<00:00:25.400> but<00:00:26.400> I<00:00:26.789> just<00:00:27.180> do<00:00:27.330> it<00:00:27.359> in<00:00:27.599> a<00:00:27.779> more

00:00:28.070 --> 00:00:28.080 
know but I just do it in a more

00:00:28.080 --> 00:00:30.320 
know but I just do it in a more
roundabout<00:00:28.500> way<00:00:28.859> since<00:00:29.640> I<00:00:29.789> know<00:00:29.849> where<00:00:30.240> the

00:00:30.320 --> 00:00:30.330 
roundabout way since I know where the

00:00:30.330 --> 00:00:31.970 
roundabout way since I know where the
spawns<00:00:30.630> are<00:00:30.869> and<00:00:31.019> I<00:00:31.080> know<00:00:31.109> the<00:00:31.560> spawns<00:00:31.830> are

00:00:31.970 --> 00:00:31.980 
spawns are and I know the spawns are

00:00:31.980 --> 00:00:33.830 
spawns are and I know the spawns are
centralized<00:00:32.399> around<00:00:32.730> the<00:00:32.820> trains<00:00:33.090> but<00:00:33.750> I'm

00:00:33.830 --> 00:00:33.840 
centralized around the trains but I'm

00:00:33.840 --> 00:00:35.389 
centralized around the trains but I'm
basically<00:00:34.110> doing<00:00:34.350> is<00:00:34.530> hopping<00:00:34.890> in<00:00:35.010> and<00:00:35.130> out<00:00:35.250> of

00:00:35.389 --> 00:00:35.399 
basically doing is hopping in and out of

00:00:35.399 --> 00:00:37.790 
basically doing is hopping in and out of
the<00:00:35.520> trains<00:00:35.820> looking<00:00:36.809> for<00:00:36.989> somebody<00:00:37.170> to<00:00:37.440> kill

00:00:37.790 --> 00:00:37.800 
the trains looking for somebody to kill

00:00:37.800 --> 00:00:40.250 
the trains looking for somebody to kill
and<00:00:38.070> I<00:00:38.879> constantly<00:00:39.390> just<00:00:39.570> run<00:00:39.750> into<00:00:40.020> him<00:00:40.110> the

00:00:40.250 --> 00:00:40.260 
and I constantly just run into him the

00:00:40.260 --> 00:00:42.260 
and I constantly just run into him the

i'm<00:02:02.250> using<00:02:02.579> the<00:02:02.670> trains<00:02:02.969> and<00:02:03.500> i'm<00:02:04.500> venturing

00:02:04.760 --> 00:02:04.770 
i'm using the trains and i'm venturing

00:02:04.770 --> 00:02:06.200 
i'm using the trains and i'm venturing
out<00:02:05.070> a<00:02:05.100> little<00:02:05.369> bit<00:02:05.549> more<00:02:05.729> and<00:02:05.790> more<00:02:06.030> and<00:02:06.180> more

00:02:06.200 --> 00:02:06.210

and more but the fact is everything is
centralizing<00:02:08.940> around<00:02:09.149> the<00:02:09.270> train<00:02:09.479> this<00:02:09.660> is

00:02:09.800 --> 00:02:09.810 
centralizing around the train this is

00:02:09.810 --> 00:02:12.080 
centralizing around the train this is
how<00:02:09.899> you<00:02:09.959> can<00:02:10.170> use<00:02:10.890> what<00:02:11.129> i<00:02:11.160> teach<00:02:11.459> you<00:02:11.640> in<00:02:11.879> a

00:02:12.080 --> 00:02:12.090 
how you can use what i teach you in a
