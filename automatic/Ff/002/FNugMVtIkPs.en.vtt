00:02:41.640 --> 00:02:41.650 
fan attendance that we've been

00:02:41.650 --> 00:02:44.280 
fan attendance that we've been
experiencing<00:02:42.190> all<00:02:42.310> season<00:02:42.640> long<00:02:42.760> two<00:02:43.330> is<00:02:43.600> the

00:02:44.280 --> 00:02:44.290 
experiencing all season long two is the

00:02:44.290 --> 00:02:45.570 
experiencing all season long two is the
freshening<00:02:44.769> up<00:02:44.950> of<00:02:45.160> the<00:02:45.340> course

00:02:45.570 --> 00:02:45.580 
freshening up of the course

00:02:45.580 --> 00:02:47.580 
freshening up of the course
configuration<00:02:46.269> we've<00:02:46.780> ran<00:02:47.019> this<00:02:47.200> course<00:02:47.470> for

00:02:47.580 --> 00:02:47.590 
configuration we've ran this course for

00:02:47.590 --> 00:02:50.190 
configuration we've ran this course for
the<00:02:47.709> last<00:02:47.860> eight<00:02:48.040> years<00:02:48.280> and<00:02:48.600> I<00:02:49.600> think<00:02:49.870> it's

00:02:50.190 --> 00:02:50.200 
the last eight years and I think it's

00:02:50.200 --> 00:02:51.809 
the last eight years and I think it's
time<00:02:50.410> that<00:02:50.440> you<00:02:50.799> know<00:02:51.100> we<00:02:51.250> need<00:02:51.430> to<00:02:51.489> consider

00:02:51.809 --> 00:02:51.819 
time that you know we need to consider

00:02:51.819 --> 00:02:54.000 
time that you know we need to consider
maybe<00:02:52.060> a<00:02:52.180> freshening<00:02:52.540> up<00:02:52.690> of<00:02:53.440> the<00:02:53.650> course<00:02:53.860> to

00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:54.010 
maybe a freshening up of the course to

00:02:54.010 --> 00:02:55.620 
maybe a freshening up of the course to
make<00:02:54.130> it<00:02:54.280> longer<00:02:54.430> more<00:02:54.819> dynamic<00:02:55.269> with<00:02:55.420> more

00:02:55.620 --> 00:02:55.630 
make it longer more dynamic with more

00:02:55.630 --> 00:02:59.789 
make it longer more dynamic with more
turns<00:02:55.870> as<00:02:56.670> you<00:02:57.670> see<00:02:57.849> this<00:02:58.000> is<00:02:58.060> the<00:02:58.440> 2010<00:02:59.440> course
