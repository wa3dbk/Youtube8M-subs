00:00:03.640 --> 00:00:06.540
 and 

00:00:07.460 --> 00:00:11.580
 this is the hispalis de joma is a 

00:00:10.170 --> 00:00:13.740
 training shoe is 

00:00:11.580 --> 00:00:15.869
 Sneaker is designed for runners 

00:00:13.740 --> 00:00:18.869
 who seek to enjoy their training 

00:00:15.869 --> 00:00:22.380
 daily are about 305 grams 

00:00:18.869 --> 00:00:23.610
 approximately for a size 42 and that 

00:00:22.380 --> 00:00:25.740
 it's a pretty good weight for a 

00:00:23.610 --> 00:00:27.510
 training shoe let's see 

00:00:25.740 --> 00:00:29.490
 how is the most part designed 

00:00:27.510 --> 00:00:32.309
 important of a running shoe 

00:00:29.490 --> 00:00:34.260
 is the sole in the hispalis the only one is 

00:00:32.309 --> 00:00:37.620
 composed of two bases of file on the 

00:00:34.260 --> 00:00:40.260
 first is less dense softer and what 

00:00:37.620 --> 00:00:42.090
 what it does is cushion the second one is more 

00:00:40.260 --> 00:00:44.250
 hard and what it does is to give stability to 

00:00:42.090 --> 00:00:45.810
 the shoe 

00:00:44.250 --> 00:00:47.220
 in the part of the sole that is in 

00:00:45.810 --> 00:00:48.960
 contact with the floor the first thing that 

00:00:47.220 --> 00:00:50.940
 we have done is to do these 

00:00:48.960 --> 00:00:52.680
 slits that would be bending lines 

00:00:50.940 --> 00:00:54.570
 that go from the back to the 

00:00:52.680 --> 00:00:58.080
 part ahead and this translates into what 

00:00:54.570 --> 00:00:59.790
 next on the heel we get that at 

00:00:58.080 --> 00:01:01.379
 landing the shoe is misshapen 

00:00:59.790 --> 00:01:04.170
 exactly where we have programmed 

00:01:01.379 --> 00:01:05.730
 so that the cut would not look 

00:01:04.170 --> 00:01:08.980
 deformed 

00:01:05.730 --> 00:01:11.920
 in the front part the lines make 

00:01:08.980 --> 00:01:14.080
 that at the takeoff the shoe goes 

00:01:11.920 --> 00:01:16.720
 progressively flex from the side 

00:01:14.080 --> 00:01:18.580
 central to the toe 

00:01:16.720 --> 00:01:21.310
 other elements that we find in the 

00:01:18.580 --> 00:01:24.010
 heel are the piece of gel this piece is 

00:01:21.310 --> 00:01:26.500
 very important to keep in mind that 

00:01:24.010 --> 00:01:28.480
 a runner supports on his heel in each 

00:01:26.500 --> 00:01:31.330
 stride up to three times its weight and with 

00:01:28.480 --> 00:01:33.580
 the gel track we get comfort and 

00:01:31.330 --> 00:01:35.220
 we manage to avoid injury is a piece 

00:01:33.580 --> 00:01:38.770
 non-deformable in the front 

00:01:35.220 --> 00:01:40.210
 we found the typical tacos of all 

00:01:38.770 --> 00:01:42.700
 running shoes that is the part 

00:01:40.210 --> 00:01:45.220
 that gives us adherence in hama 

00:01:42.700 --> 00:01:47.680
 we have designed these one size studs 

00:01:45.220 --> 00:01:49.240
 much smaller than usual because in 

00:01:47.680 --> 00:01:50.979
 first place because having more points 

00:01:49.240 --> 00:01:52.570
 of support we get more grip and 

00:01:50.979 --> 00:01:54.550
 this is important because normally 

00:01:52.570 --> 00:01:56.320
 we run through different fields the 

00:01:54.550 --> 00:01:58.750
 second advantage is that being so 

00:01:56.320 --> 00:02:00.520
 small bend more easily and 

00:01:58.750 --> 00:02:02.050
 this contributes to a cushioning in 

00:02:00.520 --> 00:02:04.390
 the front part where we do not have that 

00:02:02.050 --> 00:02:06.460
 piece of gel last on the sole 

00:02:04.390 --> 00:02:09.220
 we found that this piece already 

00:02:06.460 --> 00:02:12.640
 characteristic of joma es bis is a 

00:02:09.220 --> 00:02:15.100
 piece designed in pvc prevents the 

00:02:12.640 --> 00:02:16.470
 torsion shoe 

00:02:15.100 --> 00:02:18.960
 or flex 

00:02:16.470 --> 00:02:20.760
 in angles or axes where the foot 

00:02:18.960 --> 00:02:22.260
 I would never do it this way 

00:02:20.760 --> 00:02:24.990
 we got as we said stability 

00:02:22.260 --> 00:02:27.210
 and we also managed to avoid injuries in 

00:02:24.990 --> 00:02:28.770
 how much the cut is designed from a 

00:02:27.210 --> 00:02:30.570
 very simple way but we have 

00:02:28.770 --> 00:02:32.040
 set to give different characteristics 

00:02:30.570 --> 00:02:35.100
 to each of the parts of the shoe 

00:02:32.040 --> 00:02:37.170
 the back part the central part and 

00:02:35.100 --> 00:02:39.150
 front as to the part 

00:02:37.170 --> 00:02:41.760
 front we have achieved that the fingers 

00:02:39.150 --> 00:02:43.350
 have a lot of mobility and at the same time never 

00:02:41.760 --> 00:02:44.640
 come to play with the principle of 

00:02:43.350 --> 00:02:46.770
 sneaker so we avoid 

00:02:44.640 --> 00:02:47.980
 chafing or small lesions in the 

00:02:46.770 --> 00:02:50.050
 career 

00:02:47.980 --> 00:02:52.690
 in the central part we have made the 

00:02:50.050 --> 00:02:55.900
 Cordonera is aligned with a series of 

00:02:52.690 --> 00:02:58.180
 lines also designed so that 

00:02:55.900 --> 00:03:00.159
 It gives very good support and comfort to the 

00:02:58.180 --> 00:03:03.670
 time in the back what we have 

00:03:00.159 --> 00:03:05.470
 fact has been to reinforce everything inside 

00:03:03.670 --> 00:03:07.870
 the heel so we've tried 

00:03:05.470 --> 00:03:09.549
 achieve the maximum possible rigidity and 

00:03:07.870 --> 00:03:12.129
 thus avoid strange movements by 

00:03:09.549 --> 00:03:14.709
 both injuries and good are you the hispalis 

00:03:12.129 --> 00:03:16.360
 rubber shoe for runners 

00:03:14.709 --> 00:03:18.430
 popular but looking to enjoy 

00:03:16.360 --> 00:03:21.720
 his daily training and especially that 

00:03:18.430 --> 00:03:21.720
 They are very demanding
