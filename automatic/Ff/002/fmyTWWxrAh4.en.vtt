drag it over

00:01:57.090 --> 00:01:58.849 
drag it over
it's<00:01:57.270> just<00:01:57.450> copying<00:01:57.810> it<00:01:58.020> perfectly<00:01:58.560> so<00:01:58.829> you

00:01:58.849 --> 00:01:58.859 
it's just copying it perfectly so you

00:01:58.859 --> 00:02:00.349 
it's just copying it perfectly so you
wouldn't<00:01:59.189> even<00:01:59.280> be<00:01:59.490> able<00:01:59.579> to<00:01:59.729> tell<00:01:59.909> once<00:02:00.149> I<00:02:00.299> do

00:02:00.349 --> 00:02:00.359 
wouldn't even be able to tell once I do

00:02:00.359 --> 00:02:02.719 
wouldn't even be able to tell once I do
that<00:02:00.509> I<00:02:00.810> take<00:02:00.840> my<00:02:01.170> cross<00:02:01.409> fader<00:02:01.679> and<00:02:01.920> I<00:02:02.399> move<00:02:02.579> it

00:02:02.719 --> 00:02:02.729 
that I take my cross fader and I move it

00:02:02.729 --> 00:02:04.730 
that I take my cross fader and I move it
over<00:02:02.819> to<00:02:03.240> the<00:02:03.329> right<00:02:03.479> side<00:02:03.780> when<00:02:04.349> I<00:02:04.380> do<00:02:04.500> that

00:02:04.730 --> 00:02:04.740 
over to the right side when I do that

00:02:04.740 --> 00:02:06.349 
over to the right side when I do that
you<00:02:04.920> can't<00:02:05.159> even<00:02:05.250> tell<00:02:05.609> that<00:02:05.640> I<00:02:05.849> switched<00:02:06.179> over

00:02:06.349 --> 00:02:06.359 
you can't even tell that I switched over

00:02:06.359 --> 00:02:10.009 
you can't even tell that I switched over
so<00:02:07.020> now<00:02:07.200> I'm<00:02:07.530> ready<00:02:08.060> to<00:02:09.060> go<00:02:09.269> to<00:02:09.539> the<00:02:09.629> left<00:02:09.810> side

00:02:10.009 --> 00:02:10.019 
so now I'm ready to go to the left side

00:02:10.019 --> 00:02:22.400 
so now I'm ready to go to the left side
again<00:02:20.239> so<00:02:21.239> that's<00:02:21.360> basically<00:02:21.780> what<00:02:22.019> this<00:02:22.200> is

00:02:22.400 --> 00:02:22.410 
again so that's basically what this is

00:02:22.410 --> 00:02:26.119 
again so that's basically what this is
double<00:02:22.739> just<00:02:23.129> allowing<00:02:23.730> me<00:02:23.940> to<00:02:24.739> go<00:02:25.739> from<00:02:25.950> one

00:02:26.119 --> 00:02:26.129 
double just allowing me to go from one

00:02:26.129 --> 00:02:28.430 
double just allowing me to go from one
song<00:02:26.370> to<00:02:26.400> the<00:02:26.700> other<00:02:26.910> while<00:02:27.780> using<00:02:28.110> the<00:02:28.200> same

00:02:28.430 --> 00:02:28.440 
song to the other while using the same

00:02:28.440 --> 00:02:30.770 
song to the other while using the same
side<00:02:28.680> over<00:02:29.069> and<00:02:29.220> over<00:02:29.400> and<00:02:29.549> over<00:02:29.849> it's<00:02:30.450> kind<00:02:30.690> of

00:02:30.770 --> 00:02:30.780 
side over and over and over it's kind of

00:02:30.780 --> 00:02:32.479 
side over and over and over it's kind of
awkward<00:02:30.989> in<00:02:31.260> the<00:02:31.319> beginning<00:02:31.500> because<00:02:32.190> you<00:02:32.340> got

00:02:32.479 --> 00:02:32.489 
awkward in the beginning because you got

00:02:32.489 --> 00:02:34.190 
awkward in the beginning because you got
to<00:02:32.609> do<00:02:32.730> like<00:02:32.940> all<00:02:33.150> these<00:02:33.299> little<00:02:33.480> extra<00:02:33.959> steps

00:02:34.190 --> 00:02:34.200 
to do like all these little extra steps

00:02:35.990 --> 00:02:36.000 
but like after like the fourth or fifth

00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:37.369 
but like after like the fourth or fifth
time<00:02:36.390> you<00:02:36.510> should<00:02:36.690> be<00:02:36.780> comfortable<00:02:37.170> with<00:02:37.349> it
