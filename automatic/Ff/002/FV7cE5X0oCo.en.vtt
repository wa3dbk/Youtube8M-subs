00:01:23.020 --> 00:01:30.070
 Situation of entering training camp 

00:01:25.210 --> 00:01:35.480
 Test instructors are people who can and who can swim one of the trainees 

00:01:30.070 --> 00:01:40.490
 By sharing your ratings to classify him from first class 4 

00:01:35.480 --> 00:01:44.510
 The grade is judged by how to swim 25m . 

00:01:40.490 --> 00:01:47.990
 If the ability to be enough to go around 25m from freshwater to saltwater 

00:01:44.510 --> 00:01:51.880
 So we recommend buoyancy so 2 full

 Grading is now classified as Grading now Grade 1 to 4 

00:02:02.900 --> 00:02:10.310

 First class is now limited to 25m now 

00:02:10.310 --> 00:02:19.040
 In to accommodate the 25m exactly homework magnetic strokes 

00:02:15.620 --> 00:02:22.220
 That's exactly what I'm describing. 

00:02:19.040 --> 00:02:25.850
 Those who do that are the ones who give the first grade 

00:02:22.220 --> 00:02:29.300
 Over 15 meters of 

00:02:25.850 --> 00:02:33.770
 In using the acceptance method, 

00:02:29.300 --> 00:02:37.640
 There are a few shortcomings or a breathing motion. 

00:02:33.770 --> 00:02:43.700
 Answer If there is something that is lacking about the peacock , 

00:02:37.640 --> 00:02:45.740
 Another 25m will be dedicated there only somehow 

00:02:43.700 --> 00:02:49.430
 like this 

00:02:45.740 --> 00:02:53.870
 If the dome comes to give the reward, regardless of the stroke 

00:02:49.430 --> 00:02:56.030
 To seek barely too old homologous to their ability and another 25m 

00:02:53.870 --> 00:03:02.060

00:03:33.650 --> 00:03:39.110
 I am disgusted. Even though I have a fear of water 

00:03:38.120 --> 00:03:43.670
 There is 

00:03:39.110 --> 00:03:51.380
 Overcoming this is another challenge for combat swimming training . 

00:03:43.670 --> 00:03:54.290
 If water phobia as there are usually about five people in the society of the plate rider training 

00:03:51.380 --> 00:03:59.090
 On average. 

00:03:54.290 --> 00:04:01.940
 Especially what I remember when I was a child , 

00:03:59.090 --> 00:04:07.730
 I'm afraid to get into your water 

00:04:01.940 --> 00:04:10.280
 There are many crew members in the center. 

00:04:07.730 --> 00:04:15.590
 Because there are so many swimmers 

00:04:10.280 --> 00:04:18.239
 I started with one-on-one with my head in the water 

00:04:15.590 --> 00:04:23.789
 One step at a time 

00:04:18.239 --> 00:04:28.770
 I am going to the 25 metal which is the master of education now. 

00:04:23.789 --> 00:04:30.509
 Classified as they stimulate trainees to swim with the help of motivated rated as Class 1 

00:04:28.770 --> 00:04:35.419
 I will learn 

00:04:30.509 --> 00:04:35.419
 It has the advantage of being able to learn more easily than instructors 

00:04:35.460 --> 00:04:42.180
 Final trainee caught in camera 

00:04:38.490 --> 00:04:46.470
 It is in the middle of acceptance practice after receiving stimulus judgment 

00:04:42.180 --> 00:04:47.880
 I try to learn swim with the help of motivators, but it's hard to even float in the water yet. 

00:04:46.470 --> 00:04:50.400
 I see 

00:04:47.880 --> 00:04:54.900
 What was the problem? 

00:04:50.400 --> 00:04:59.610
 I've never done this, so this time I learned the navy base so I first at school . 

00:04:54.900 --> 00:05:03.900
 We did not have any phobias, but there was some pressure. 

00:04:59.610 --> 00:05:07.409
 Come to film there and at first difficult for me to read to learn what motivated me to 

00:05:03.900 --> 00:05:12.120
 I do not have the slightest burden of doing so and I learned so much fun. 

00:05:07.409 --> 00:05:16.979
 Recruit finally received the final acceptance tertiary trap 

00:05:12.120 --> 00:05:20.930

 You can request an upgrade 

00:05:24.419 --> 00:05:33.330
 Every training has nothing to do with what you want to do. 

00:05:29.880 --> 00:05:38.280
 Obviously, the ability to improve 

00:05:33.330 --> 00:05:41.639
 Confidence in the ability and willingness to have all passed the examination crowned 

00:05:38.280 --> 00:05:47.870
