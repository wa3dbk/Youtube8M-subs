00:00:34.309 --> 00:00:39.920
 it's time to build a trap 

00:00:44.490 --> 00:00:49.290
 Hello everyone guys and welcome to 

00:00:46.920 --> 00:00:50.940
 this new video as you see from this one 

00:00:49.290 --> 00:00:53.310
 trap and small presentation 

00:00:50.940 --> 00:00:55.140
 that I showed you even though it's not a 

00:00:53.310 --> 00:00:57.270
 trap and let's say a defense system 

00:00:55.140 --> 00:00:59.880
 which can become a trap 

00:00:57.270 --> 00:01:02.310
 of course if adequately modified 

00:00:59.880 --> 00:01:07.200
 simply by using the lava 

00:01:02.310 --> 00:01:08.670
 or in short changes decided by you I in 

00:01:07.200 --> 00:01:12.060
 this case I think of lava but 

00:01:08.670 --> 00:01:14.070
 could damn music could 

00:01:12.060 --> 00:01:16.530
 also other things to be added now 

00:01:14.070 --> 00:01:19.200
 I thought right now he has 

00:01:16.530 --> 00:01:21.360
 an automatic activator of ideas tnt 

00:01:19.200 --> 00:01:23.430
 there are many and many easy ones too from 

00:01:21.360 --> 00:01:25.350
 realize to you the choice we go to 

00:01:23.430 --> 00:01:27.119
 see how it works below 

00:01:25.350 --> 00:01:29.340
 here we are, we have arrived in the part 

00:01:27.119 --> 00:01:32.970
 lower and we go immediately to pierce 

00:01:29.340 --> 00:01:35.250
 this sort we say of floor in 

00:01:32.970 --> 00:01:37.890
 glass that had simple function of 

00:01:35.250 --> 00:01:39.510
 show a little the inside as you see there 

00:01:37.890 --> 00:01:41.490
 are some bats that fit me 

00:01:39.510 --> 00:01:43.440
 annoying and here we see ours 

00:01:41.490 --> 00:01:45.150
 first mechanism here is the door that 

00:01:43.440 --> 00:01:47.220
 through two investors will have the function 

00:01:45.150 --> 00:01:50.240
 to close when the water is opened 

00:01:47.220 --> 00:01:52.830
 and open when the water is closed 

00:01:50.240 --> 00:01:55.860
 here is a series of repeaters there 

00:01:52.830 --> 00:01:57.929
 It leads up to the outside the entire property 

00:01:55.860 --> 00:02:00.929
 there is a tower that is one of the functions 

00:01:57.929 --> 00:02:02.490
 of the days as they are called of the 

00:02:00.929 --> 00:02:04.950
 directions torch inverters 

00:02:02.490 --> 00:02:09.149
 so you can watch the video 

00:02:04.950 --> 00:02:10.770
 and from here just come wings now vi 

00:02:09.149 --> 00:02:12.870
 I show an almost activated 

00:02:10.770 --> 00:02:14.640
 very basic mechanism but not wanted 

00:02:12.870 --> 00:02:16.080
 to explain why he has it 

00:02:14.640 --> 00:02:17.490
 explained 

00:02:16.080 --> 00:02:20.160
 and we come directly to these 

00:02:17.490 --> 00:02:22.020
 pistons oh my God these pistons have the 

00:02:20.160 --> 00:02:24.180
 function to be activated when the 

00:02:22.020 --> 00:02:26.280
 lever is deactivated precisely because there 

00:02:24.180 --> 00:02:27.120
 as you can see we have an inverter e 

00:02:26.280 --> 00:02:28.890
 the other way around 

00:02:27.120 --> 00:02:31.650
 so in times of need maybe 

00:02:28.890 --> 00:02:33.569
 when we see a cannon near the 

00:02:31.650 --> 00:02:36.270
 our base we will care about 

00:02:33.569 --> 00:02:38.360
 we will immediately activate the lever in 

00:02:36.270 --> 00:02:42.569
 to be protected automatically 

00:02:38.360 --> 00:02:46.920
 this we say security system no 

00:02:42.569 --> 00:02:49.290
 a the cons even if only the gods 

00:02:46.920 --> 00:02:51.900
 against them, but only one 

00:02:49.290 --> 00:02:54.330
 against which I can attribute them and the expense 

00:02:51.900 --> 00:02:57.210
 of material because there are no others 

00:02:54.330 --> 00:02:58.710
 very simple this trap is como 

00:02:57.210 --> 00:03:01.650
 based on how you want to choose you 

00:02:58.710 --> 00:03:04.590
 in short, its function or protection is 

00:03:01.650 --> 00:03:07.110
 indestructible very simple because the 

00:03:04.590 --> 00:03:09.180
 because it is that even if an enemy will try 

00:03:07.110 --> 00:03:12.600
 for example building with canon is by 

00:03:09.180 --> 00:03:14.880
 tearing down this structure will not be possible 

00:03:12.600 --> 00:03:17.340
 to do because even if he could 

00:03:14.880 --> 00:03:18.900
 hit it will your game that is 

00:03:17.340 --> 00:03:21.090
 it will damage the structure 

00:03:18.900 --> 00:03:23.340
 will automatically spit water from all 

00:03:21.090 --> 00:03:26.070
 sides then creating a real one 

00:03:23.340 --> 00:03:28.080
 situation in which there is no escape 

00:03:26.070 --> 00:03:30.450
 the only disadvantage of this one of this 

00:03:28.080 --> 00:03:33.060
 protection that there must be someone who 

00:03:30.450 --> 00:03:36.680
 physically the active disadvantage he can 

00:03:33.060 --> 00:03:39.330
 be easily let's say it turned 

00:03:36.680 --> 00:03:42.630
 simply by placing the 

00:03:39.330 --> 00:03:46.350
 I don't know if you have twines 

00:03:42.630 --> 00:03:49.290
 new objects of repsol the string 

00:03:46.350 --> 00:03:51.380
 here it is, positioning them I don't know why 

00:03:49.290 --> 00:03:54.420
 just put string as you see 

00:03:51.380 --> 00:03:57.900
 on the stone it is practically invisible 

00:03:54.420 --> 00:03:59.760
 however then I never see a bug but 

00:03:57.900 --> 00:04:04.080
 very little by placing strings 

00:03:59.760 --> 00:04:06.140
 all around we could what anyway 

00:04:04.080 --> 00:04:08.760
 we can create a system a 

00:04:06.140 --> 00:04:11.010
 recognition is that if an enemy does 

00:04:08.760 --> 00:04:13.110
 approaching an automatic monster also 

00:04:11.010 --> 00:04:15.060
 part system we say he has an idea 

00:04:13.110 --> 00:04:17.280
 very simple to implement so no 

00:04:15.060 --> 00:04:19.440
 I did it also because I repeat it is me 

00:04:17.280 --> 00:04:21.450
 come to mind now and I left you 

00:04:19.440 --> 00:04:23.430
 precisely for you you will find the download 

00:04:21.450 --> 00:04:27.110
 of the map in description and for this 

00:04:23.430 --> 00:04:27.110
 video was all hi everyone
