 increases armor and magic resistance 

00:01:30.920 --> 00:01:36.710
 annie and inflicts damage to enemies that 

00:01:33.439 --> 00:01:41.240

 units within the area in which 

00:01:45.140 --> 00:01:50.450
 appears this this little teddy bear from which 

00:01:48.350 --> 00:01:53.149

00:01:53.149 --> 00:01:57.380
 attack and burn the enemies that 

00:01:55.100 --> 00:01:59.299
 surround you can also control it with the 

00:01:57.380 --> 00:02:02.850

00:02:05.880 --> 00:02:10.530
 we will go up in the following way 

00:02:08.310 --> 00:02:13.050
 we will start raising the cross but only 

00:02:10.530 --> 00:02:15.270
 to ensure the last blow to the 

00:02:13.050 --> 00:02:17.340
 minions without spending mana since the 

00:02:15.270 --> 00:02:19.010
 ability returns the cost if 

00:02:17.340 --> 00:02:21.239
 you eliminate the target with stability 

00:02:19.010 --> 00:02:24.300
 maximize we have the double uve followed by 

00:02:21.239 --> 00:02:27.930

 image of runes we will put marks of 

00:02:36.180 --> 00:02:40.680
 penetration of armor power lands 

00:02:38.220 --> 00:02:43.019
 weakness and regeneration of mana glyphs 

00:02:40.680 --> 00:02:45.750
 of magic resistance and quintessence of 

00:02:43.019 --> 00:02:48.840
 more skill power with spells of 

00:02:45.750 --> 00:02:50.730
 flash invoker ignite at the beginning of 

00:02:48.840 --> 00:02:52.860
 the game will start with boots and 

00:02:50.730 --> 00:02:54.870
 potions to make sure we have a 

00:02:52.860 --> 00:02:57.630
 good endurance on the line and take the 

00:02:54.870 --> 00:02:59.069
 greatest possible experience apart from 

00:02:57.630 --> 00:03:01.410
 permeate as much as we can 

00:02:59.069 --> 00:03:04.470
 then we will get two doran rings 

00:03:01.410 --> 00:03:06.540
 for manna regeneration extra life and 

00:03:04.470 --> 00:03:09.530
 ability power that grants and 

00:03:06.540 --> 00:03:11.780
 we will finish the sorcerer's boots 

00:03:09.530 --> 00:03:13.610
 then we will get tear from the 

00:03:11.780 --> 00:03:16.459
 goddess and an explosive wand for 

00:03:13.610 --> 00:03:18.319
 turn them into a gel-scope 

00:03:16.459 --> 00:03:20.720
 which generates mana with each skill that 

00:03:18.319 --> 00:03:23.330
 uses and becomes the embrace of being to 

00:03:20.720 --> 00:03:25.480
 Finally, remember that this item can be activated 

00:03:23.330 --> 00:03:28.069
 and it gives you a little extra temporary life 

00:03:25.480 --> 00:03:30.530
 followed by this we will get a rod 

00:03:28.069 --> 00:03:32.959
 unnecessarily great I know they say 

00:03:30.530 --> 00:03:34.280
 that our name is but well that 's it 

00:03:32.959 --> 00:03:36.860
 are the names of the items and good 

00:03:34.280 --> 00:03:38.630
 then to follow him with the guide after 

00:03:36.860 --> 00:03:40.459
 will wash unnecessarily large too 

00:03:38.630 --> 00:03:42.560
 we will get a guard arm of the 

00:03:40.459 --> 00:03:44.959
 seeker and we'll turn it into a watch 

00:03:42.560 --> 00:03:47.390
 of sand this item is also activatable 

00:03:44.959 --> 00:03:49.430
 and it makes you immune to everything during almost 

00:03:47.390 --> 00:03:51.410
 three seconds but it will not let you 

00:03:49.430 --> 00:03:53.360
 move or you can use some kind of 

00:03:51.410 --> 00:03:56.090
 ability until the effect of 

00:03:53.360 --> 00:03:58.340
 this item we will get another rod 

00:03:56.090 --> 00:04:00.890
 unnecessarily large and a wand 

00:03:58.340 --> 00:04:03.470
 explosive and we will complete a hat 

00:04:00.890 --> 00:04:04.910
 deadly or death eaters is deadly is 

00:04:03.470 --> 00:04:07.430
 deadly I have it here I'm reading it 

00:04:04.910 --> 00:04:09.380
 I fell for mothers that is deadly ok the 

00:04:07.430 --> 00:04:11.660
 which increases all your ability power 

00:04:09.380 --> 00:04:13.010
 at 30 percent again 

00:04:11.660 --> 00:04:15.049
 we will get another wand 

00:04:13.010 --> 00:04:16.070
 unnecessarily large and a codex 

00:04:15.049 --> 00:04:18.410
 diabolical 

00:04:16.070 --> 00:04:20.120
 to end the grip of death this 

00:04:18.410 --> 00:04:22.580
 item basically gives you another 

00:04:20.120 --> 00:04:25.340
 Rank ability apart from hurting 

00:04:22.580 --> 00:04:27.320
 magical slows down your goal and already for 

00:04:25.340 --> 00:04:29.480
 to finish we will get a book 

00:04:27.320 --> 00:04:32.960
 amplifier and another explosive wand 

00:04:29.480 --> 00:04:35.800
 to turn them into the staff of emptiness 

00:04:32.960 --> 00:04:38.450
 and have more armor penetration 

00:04:35.800 --> 00:04:40.790
 summarizing you will complete would be boots 

00:04:38.450 --> 00:04:42.860
 of the sorcerer with distortion hug the 

00:04:40.790 --> 00:04:45.740
 seraphim hourglass hat 

00:04:42.860 --> 00:04:48.290
 deadly death claw and staff 

00:04:45.740 --> 00:04:50.330
 of the vacuum love the boots when 

00:04:48.290 --> 00:04:52.860
 can or have time since it is not 

00:04:50.330 --> 00:04:54.810
 both a priority 

00:04:52.860 --> 00:04:57.810
 also for those who ask what kind 

00:04:54.810 --> 00:04:59.490
 of champions counter see and I found 

00:04:57.810 --> 00:05:01.830
 sells doing something that battles 

00:04:59.490 --> 00:05:04.979
 by nature of skills in what 

00:05:01.830 --> 00:05:07.110
 to champions refer good in 

00:05:04.979 --> 00:05:10.250
 first place we have a brand for its high 

00:05:07.110 --> 00:05:10.250
 scope in terms of skills 

00:05:10.370 --> 00:05:14.150
 apart from your passive that you go 

00:05:11.990 --> 00:05:16.100
 spending with each skill after 

00:05:14.150 --> 00:05:18.080
 we have oriana with her you will have the 

00:05:16.100 --> 00:05:21.680
 same problem apart from the shield that 

00:05:18.080 --> 00:05:24.380
 it has to cancel you some kind 

00:05:21.680 --> 00:05:27.199
 of another combo could reduce the damage that 

00:05:24.380 --> 00:05:29.000
 give him or forgive him in third 

00:05:27.199 --> 00:05:32.570
 place we have morgana that also with 

00:05:29.000 --> 00:05:35.090
 his shield canceled had stun or stunned 

00:05:32.570 --> 00:05:37.820
 cancel the condition do not tell us how to 

00:05:35.090 --> 00:05:40.010
 Say and well apart from your passive 

00:05:37.820 --> 00:05:41.900
 that regenerates your life making it more 

00:05:40.010 --> 00:05:43.820
 durable on the line and last but 

00:05:41.900 --> 00:05:46.220
 no less annoying with the fourth place 

00:05:43.820 --> 00:05:48.530
 we have fish which can evade 

00:05:46.220 --> 00:05:50.840
 enemy skills thanks to his jump 

00:05:48.530 --> 00:05:52.520
 breaking the annie combo to what I 

00:05:50.840 --> 00:05:54.710
 I mean with the combo of an and good any 

00:05:52.520 --> 00:05:56.810
 He is a champion who despite doing a lot 

00:05:54.710 --> 00:05:58.699
 damage when sheds her skills 

00:05:56.810 --> 00:06:01.370
 totally exposed to skills 

00:05:58.699 --> 00:06:04.280
 enemies since the cni has very little 

00:06:01.370 --> 00:06:05.510
 life when you stay with all your 

00:06:04.280 --> 00:06:07.610
 cooling skills you 

00:06:05.510 --> 00:06:09.740
 I recommend that you step back until 

00:06:07.610 --> 00:06:11.300
 you go back to acts good until you finish 

00:06:09.740 --> 00:06:13.160
 to cool down and you can go back to 

00:06:11.300 --> 00:06:16.190
 use them since they have and is not a 

00:06:13.160 --> 00:06:18.560
 champion that endures a lot 

00:06:16.190 --> 00:06:20.090
 some advice some advice play 

00:06:18.560 --> 00:06:22.640
 defensive until they see you do it 

00:06:20.090 --> 00:06:26.600
 a good amount of life to annie or 

00:06:22.640 --> 00:06:29.630
 can wait and not upload it on the shield 

00:06:26.600 --> 00:06:33.200
 depending if the enemy champion is very 

00:06:29.630 --> 00:06:35.450
 aggressive or is it or is it not so aggressive to 

00:06:33.200 --> 00:06:38.060
 have the most amount of damage in the cv 

00:06:35.450 --> 00:06:41.450
 and in the w what would be the little ball of 

00:06:38.060 --> 00:06:43.220
 fire or flare ok good guys 

00:06:41.450 --> 00:06:45.170
