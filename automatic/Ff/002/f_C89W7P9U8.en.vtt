00:00:03.710 --> 00:00:07.759
 hello that such welcome to a new 

00:00:05.990 --> 00:00:10.370
 video I'll show you a few 

00:00:07.759 --> 00:00:12.110
 enough little things of the brand tips 

00:00:10.370 --> 00:00:13.670
 Cosmetics that I do not know if you know her is 

00:00:12.110 --> 00:00:15.260
 an American brand that has started to 

00:00:13.670 --> 00:00:18.529
 commercialize recently in Spain 

00:00:15.260 --> 00:00:21.079
 through online links of sellers of 

00:00:18.529 --> 00:00:22.460
 online distributors and I will let you go 

00:00:21.079 --> 00:00:23.899
 the links of all the products in the 

00:00:22.460 --> 00:00:25.849
 information box if you want 

00:00:23.899 --> 00:00:27.950
 buy them and well we will teach you 

00:00:25.849 --> 00:00:30.230
 the things that I have in the first place 

00:00:27.950 --> 00:00:32.840
 I'm going to show you this mini paintbrush blanket 

00:00:30.230 --> 00:00:35.630
 which is super funny and for travel 

00:00:32.840 --> 00:00:37.070
 because it's super super super finite and 

00:00:35.630 --> 00:00:38.600
 Well I have a dirty brush because 

00:00:37.070 --> 00:00:40.190
 just now that he came from the beach 

00:00:38.600 --> 00:00:42.340
 is the one that I've taken and well 

00:00:40.190 --> 00:00:46.750
 it happens to teach 

00:00:42.340 --> 00:00:48.640
 They are brushes like that, short and the hair has 

00:00:46.750 --> 00:00:51.280
 this is hair 

00:00:48.640 --> 00:00:53.470
 - these two others are synthetic hair 

00:00:51.280 --> 00:00:55.840
 but it 's a pretty synthetic hair 

00:00:53.470 --> 00:00:57.640
 Pretty soft and good hair 

00:00:55.840 --> 00:01:00.010
 natural are a soft pass that are 

00:00:57.640 --> 00:01:02.350
 also and well well they come to you this is 

00:01:00.010 --> 00:01:04.960
 one of powders is that we can use to 

00:01:02.350 --> 00:01:07.990
 corrector or for shadows these 

00:01:04.960 --> 00:01:12.430
 Shadows eyeliner lips and eyebrows and 

00:01:07.990 --> 00:01:14.740
 eyelashes and now I'm teaching the first of 

00:01:12.430 --> 00:01:17.140
 face that has this what I most 

00:01:14.740 --> 00:01:18.700
 like the brand are the containers me 

00:01:17.140 --> 00:01:20.020
 I am very know if the mask 

00:01:18.700 --> 00:01:22.090
 love packaging because this one 

00:01:20.020 --> 00:01:24.520
 they also do not look like packaging 

00:01:22.090 --> 00:01:27.280
 I like them very much, they seem very 

00:01:24.520 --> 00:01:30.250
 Sober and perfect and good comes like this 

00:01:27.280 --> 00:01:32.619
 like in this little tube and well it's a 

00:01:30.250 --> 00:01:34.509
 First you can apply it if you 

00:01:32.619 --> 00:01:35.830
 minimizes a little bit the pore makes you 

00:01:34.509 --> 00:01:37.149
 the makeup lasts longer I'm going to 

00:01:35.830 --> 00:01:40.630
 teach the texture that is thus a 

00:01:37.149 --> 00:01:42.160
 texture as quite liquid and there very 

00:01:40.630 --> 00:01:44.300
 uncomfortable to apply and then it 

00:01:42.160 --> 00:01:46.580
 absorb 

00:01:44.300 --> 00:01:49.400
 following with faces the Lord a 

00:01:46.580 --> 00:01:51.830
 blusher is the tone waves the blushes 

00:01:49.400 --> 00:01:53.300
 they have this format and I like that 

00:01:51.830 --> 00:01:54.920
 behind you can put something to 

00:01:53.300 --> 00:01:56.450
 remove them and put them in palette that is 

00:01:54.920 --> 00:01:58.910
 probably what I ended up doing 

00:01:56.450 --> 00:02:01.340
 because the boxes do not finish me 

00:01:58.910 --> 00:02:04.220
 to convince is this tone so coral with 

00:02:01.340 --> 00:02:08.660
 very cool flashes going on with eyes os 

00:02:04.220 --> 00:02:10.430
 I teach the pre base or the base of eyes that 

00:02:08.660 --> 00:02:13.130
 It is one of the most famous products of 

00:02:10.430 --> 00:02:14.510
 the brand because it pepper a lot and it gives 

00:02:13.130 --> 00:02:16.310
 pretty color then makes the 

00:02:14.510 --> 00:02:18.770
 shadow that you put on you 

00:02:16.310 --> 00:02:21.470
 really see the color that is and not 

00:02:18.770 --> 00:02:24.190
 change the tonality and then appreciate the 

00:02:21.470 --> 00:02:24.190
 flashes and more 

00:02:32.340 --> 00:02:36.840
 I also took the headliner but 

00:02:34.319 --> 00:02:38.670
 moment I did not open it so because 

00:02:36.840 --> 00:02:40.860
 I'm waiting to finish another so that 

00:02:38.670 --> 00:02:42.959
 It does not dry out and I'm not going to 

00:02:40.860 --> 00:02:43.769
 teach today but good I'll show you 

00:02:42.959 --> 00:02:45.269
 soon 

00:02:43.769 --> 00:02:46.980
 now I show you three of the umbrellas 

00:02:45.269 --> 00:02:48.840
 that come in a similar packaging 

00:02:46.980 --> 00:02:50.819
 we are the same as blusher but more 

00:02:48.840 --> 00:02:52.470
 small and have the size of the 

00:02:50.819 --> 00:02:54.510
 shadows of max if I'm not wrong 

00:02:52.470 --> 00:02:57.150
 so then also those of petare and 

00:02:54.510 --> 00:02:59.870
 I'll put them in palettes the first time 

00:02:57.150 --> 00:02:59.870
 queen fresh 

00:03:01.240 --> 00:03:05.050
 it's a white tone like that a little bit 

00:03:03.520 --> 00:03:07.570
 satin 

00:03:05.050 --> 00:03:09.400
 It paints enough to be a shadow 

00:03:07.570 --> 00:03:11.500
 clear as you see has a few flashes 

00:03:09.400 --> 00:03:13.300
 I shine very beautiful the second one is 

00:03:11.500 --> 00:03:16.420
 perfect for typical shade of 

00:03:13.300 --> 00:03:19.650
 transition is the cappuccino tone and look 

00:03:16.420 --> 00:03:22.019
 what pigments with just one pass 

00:03:19.650 --> 00:03:25.189
 and the last one that I teach is cinnamon 

00:03:22.019 --> 00:03:28.189
 cinnamon spies that is one is a garnet 

00:03:25.189 --> 00:03:28.189
 satin 

00:03:28.300 --> 00:03:32.890
 that I also pigment a lot with a 

00:03:30.850 --> 00:03:34.210
 single last look what pigmentation has 

00:03:32.890 --> 00:03:36.430
 the shadow 

00:03:34.210 --> 00:03:39.970
 now I show you the eyebrow kit the s 

00:03:36.430 --> 00:03:42.970
 essential brow kit that comes with a 

00:03:39.970 --> 00:03:44.530
 mirror your brush a wax a shadow 

00:03:42.970 --> 00:03:47.250
 a little bit lighter and a darker one 

00:03:44.530 --> 00:03:47.250
 to make the mixtures 

00:03:50.720 --> 00:03:55.100
 to finish with eyes I show you this 

00:03:52.850 --> 00:03:57.950
 mascara is that I re 

00:03:55.100 --> 00:04:01.640
 you love it is the light trife 

00:03:57.950 --> 00:04:03.680
 there are two masks I think this one has is 

00:04:01.640 --> 00:04:07.550
 this as it is transparent and has the 

00:04:03.680 --> 00:04:10.880
 silicone brush to see if I take it out without 

00:04:07.550 --> 00:04:13.750
 splash it's pretty flexible to see 

00:04:10.880 --> 00:04:13.750
 if you see it up close 

00:04:14.670 --> 00:04:20.250
 which is quite flexible you see but it has 

00:04:17.940 --> 00:04:22.049
 some cells like silicone that I 

00:04:20.250 --> 00:04:23.970
 Reminds a lot of yesterday's bill 

00:04:22.049 --> 00:04:26.460
 benefit because everything it does is 

00:04:23.970 --> 00:04:28.860
 lengthen them very much and leaves them very 

00:04:26.460 --> 00:04:30.870
 defined and very combed if you like what 

00:04:28.860 --> 00:04:33.840
 better to be more voluminous then 

00:04:30.870 --> 00:04:35.669
 this one is not or at least in my tab 

00:04:33.840 --> 00:04:37.950
 it does not leave me very bright it leaves me very 

00:04:35.669 --> 00:04:40.530
 long very separated and very combed 

00:04:37.950 --> 00:04:42.480
 lips I show you the ship was my plan 

00:04:40.530 --> 00:04:44.550
 per 

00:04:42.480 --> 00:04:46.260
 good, nothing is a kind of 

00:04:44.550 --> 00:04:47.490
 brillito that has menthol effect and what 

00:04:46.260 --> 00:04:50.310
 what it does is that it inflates you a little bit 

00:04:47.490 --> 00:04:51.960
 lip the truth is that I have not noticed anything 

00:04:50.310 --> 00:04:54.120
 also exaggerated and that especially 

00:04:51.960 --> 00:04:56.670
 principle you notice a little but good 

00:04:54.120 --> 00:04:58.950
 following with gloss that I teach you the 

00:04:56.670 --> 00:05:01.020
 cloud radiant tone I'm not going to put it 

00:04:58.950 --> 00:05:03.450
 because it's so tiny it's a 

00:05:01.020 --> 00:05:07.370
 species of coral with golden sparkles 

00:05:03.450 --> 00:05:07.370
 very similar to blusher 

00:05:12.830 --> 00:05:16.670
 and good is a gloss that does not contribute 

00:05:14.570 --> 00:05:19.100
 too much color to finish with lips 

00:05:16.670 --> 00:05:22.010
 I teach you three lipsticks the tones are 

00:05:19.100 --> 00:05:23.750
 natural in its place and ruby are about 

00:05:22.010 --> 00:05:25.790
 lipsticks except for the red ones 

00:05:23.750 --> 00:05:27.830
 others are rather texture similar to 

00:05:25.790 --> 00:05:30.110
 mack cleansing the natural has me 

00:05:27.830 --> 00:05:32.750
 in love reminds me of the angel of mac 

00:05:30.110 --> 00:05:34.730
 it is beautiful on the lips and red 

00:05:32.750 --> 00:05:37.340
 slug and also good garnet remains 

00:05:34.730 --> 00:05:40.550
 spectacular one already finished with nicknames 

00:05:37.340 --> 00:05:43.449
 showing the younger seniors that good 

00:05:40.550 --> 00:05:45.430
 well ten years younger that is a 

00:05:43.449 --> 00:05:47.020
 you wait for makeup fixer they have 

00:05:45.430 --> 00:05:49.809
 This one is for more mature files and 

00:05:47.020 --> 00:05:51.669
 they have another one to ratify a bit to 

00:05:49.809 --> 00:05:54.789
 younger skins or that you like and without 

00:05:51.669 --> 00:05:56.469
 shines I've tried the other one and I like it 

00:05:54.789 --> 00:05:58.240
 more this because the other leaves my face 

00:05:56.469 --> 00:06:00.939
 a little more short nothing and there's the 

00:05:58.240 --> 00:06:03.460
 truth is that you notice that it has as dust 

00:06:00.939 --> 00:06:05.439
 that has something like you're not so 

00:06:03.460 --> 00:06:08.020
 throws you a little bit but after a while 

00:06:05.439 --> 00:06:10.419
 and it leaves your skin very well not this 

00:06:08.020 --> 00:06:11.800
 you have not noticed yet I'll have to get 

00:06:10.419 --> 00:06:13.839
 to look one day wearing the same 

00:06:11.800 --> 00:06:16.270
 makeup with him and without him but he has 

00:06:13.839 --> 00:06:19.150
 a lot of fame say that is the product 

00:06:16.270 --> 00:06:20.830
 basic of Jennifer Lopez and good, well, not 

00:06:19.150 --> 00:06:22.270
 I know, keep trying and I'll tell you what and how 

00:06:20.830 --> 00:06:24.099
 nothing I think I do not forget anything 

00:06:22.270 --> 00:06:26.080

00:06:24.099 --> 00:06:28.210
