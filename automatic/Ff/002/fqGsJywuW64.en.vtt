00:00:03.529 --> 00:00:13.100
 we started to see the match prayer and you 

00:00:05.790 --> 00:00:14.960
 I say I liked the guys 

00:00:13.100 --> 00:00:16.840
 but I think I have a good friend in 

00:00:14.960 --> 00:00:20.330
 first account was the first match 

00:00:16.840 --> 00:00:22.010
 there was much expectation our new 

00:00:20.330 --> 00:00:25.350
 people 

00:00:22.010 --> 00:00:29.279
 because only by training today 

00:00:25.350 --> 00:00:31.630
 five known players we know 

00:00:29.279 --> 00:00:33.370
 some of us are going to say they play here 

00:00:31.630 --> 00:00:36.610
 they are disciples who are good at 

00:00:33.370 --> 00:00:39.780
 they could well for a little less now not 

00:00:36.610 --> 00:00:44.160
 just on top of the piles 

00:00:39.780 --> 00:00:45.840
 alan ruiz and what all that the 

00:00:44.160 --> 00:00:48.690
 threat and you have what I have going 

00:00:45.840 --> 00:00:52.649
 simply by taking it 

00:00:48.690 --> 00:00:55.589
 the reality is that it usually happens when 

00:00:52.649 --> 00:00:58.520
 a youth coach adds so much 

00:00:55.589 --> 00:01:03.080
 talent in everything together 

00:00:58.520 --> 00:01:07.910
 It often happens that they do not all work 

00:01:03.080 --> 00:01:10.290
 basic above all this principle 

00:01:07.910 --> 00:01:12.270
 but it is also true that you have to give it 

00:01:10.290 --> 00:01:15.350
 some minutes some parties either 

00:01:12.270 --> 00:01:15.350
 so a song 

00:01:17.170 --> 00:01:23.950
 but the message they gave was 

00:01:22.100 --> 00:01:27.890
 hurried 

00:01:23.950 --> 00:01:30.830
 when I say that what feeds it 

00:01:27.890 --> 00:01:33.220
 good of the message that they gave a day 

00:01:30.830 --> 00:01:36.230
 they showed none 

00:01:33.220 --> 00:01:38.480
 aptitude not to associate any field 

00:01:36.230 --> 00:01:41.390
 for four be two in each as 

00:01:38.480 --> 00:01:46.090
 could he handed the ball to his partner 

00:01:41.390 --> 00:01:46.090
 demanded when it no longer corresponded 

00:01:47.010 --> 00:01:52.280
 a good preview of the castle forward 

00:01:49.050 --> 00:01:52.280
 with that header 

00:01:55.320 --> 00:02:00.850
 and it clearly shows that the boys do not 

00:01:59.320 --> 00:02:02.619
 they were able to develop their game and their 

00:02:00.850 --> 00:02:04.930
 ideas and they were not rather cloudy with 

00:02:02.619 --> 00:02:06.490
 eager to show sometimes anxiety 

00:02:04.930 --> 00:02:10.179
 for showing you can play against 

00:02:06.490 --> 00:02:12.130
 young guys was one of the things that 

00:02:10.179 --> 00:02:14.200
 More did this is that when fuck 

00:02:12.130 --> 00:02:16.239
 hands a different feeling the caravan 11 

00:02:14.200 --> 00:02:18.239
 to 9 I say that yes national good is 

00:02:16.239 --> 00:02:21.380
 because something strange happens and some of them 

00:02:18.239 --> 00:02:27.770
 there is this merit 

00:02:21.380 --> 00:02:32.810
 imagine opened in 40 43 minutes 

00:02:27.770 --> 00:02:35.600
 if it is not the same second time at 25 

00:02:32.810 --> 00:02:37.520
 minutes and second time the second is 

00:02:35.600 --> 00:02:39.230
 play 20 minutes playable cost of 

00:02:37.520 --> 00:02:41.810
 difference did not open 

00:02:39.230 --> 00:02:43.250
 thanks very few very few havana 

00:02:41.810 --> 00:02:47.209
 the vine already mentioned 

00:02:43.250 --> 00:02:49.569
 but to try suddenly in force on him 

00:02:47.209 --> 00:02:51.280
 is that that is a right hand drive 

00:02:49.569 --> 00:02:52.880
 couple has used it in the championship 

00:02:51.280 --> 00:02:55.340
 many times 

00:02:52.880 --> 00:02:57.260
 maybe I should have played one until 

00:02:55.340 --> 00:02:59.600
 we started to give individual questions 

00:02:57.260 --> 00:03:02.330
 when in reality when they fail so much 

00:02:59.600 --> 00:03:04.440
 of accessibility is because it is 

00:03:02.330 --> 00:03:07.050
 close 

00:03:04.440 --> 00:03:12.130
 actually go to the team because it's missing 

00:03:07.050 --> 00:03:15.490
 more individualities because that's not the way 

00:03:12.130 --> 00:03:17.680
 it's too obvious that they are boys 

00:03:15.490 --> 00:03:20.470
 who are skillful 

00:03:17.680 --> 00:03:22.690
 these are skillful boys but not 

00:03:20.470 --> 00:03:24.460
 they play well if not 

00:03:22.690 --> 00:03:27.130
 because not everyone better on your team 

00:03:24.460 --> 00:03:29.830
 they are protected by other players who 

00:03:27.130 --> 00:03:32.440
 they will facilitate racing play the primers 

00:03:29.830 --> 00:03:34.210
 and this they play well they surprise a 

00:03:32.440 --> 00:03:36.160
 little to the colors because they are good 

00:03:34.210 --> 00:03:37.960
 sustained by their peers and not 

00:03:36.160 --> 00:03:40.660
 they have to be the ones 

00:03:37.960 --> 00:03:42.860
 protagonists of the partners are the 

00:03:40.660 --> 00:03:47.750
 that the plays finish 

00:03:42.860 --> 00:03:50.420
 both centurion and open and good and 

00:03:47.750 --> 00:03:55.840
 that he was uncomfortable centurion as he was 

00:03:50.420 --> 00:03:59.330
 they watched the game you want prayer that 

00:03:55.840 --> 00:04:00.580
 you would have to continue on the same path or 

00:03:59.330 --> 00:04:04.010
 would have to be seen when changing the group 

00:04:00.580 --> 00:04:07.270
 is played was the 2 to 0 of chile 

00:04:04.010 --> 00:04:07.270
 in the end 

00:04:11.569 --> 00:04:17.150
 this disappointing this I the truth that 

00:04:15.049 --> 00:04:18.889
 I do not know now, we should leave them 

00:04:17.150 --> 00:04:25.430
 pibes this is a game of one chance 

00:04:18.889 --> 00:04:26.750
 but of course we are well and in one of 

00:04:25.430 --> 00:04:29.960
 those shows videos of when you're 

00:04:26.750 --> 00:04:32.000
 person but canaries then what 

00:04:29.960 --> 00:04:33.800
 they asked confused with that can be 

00:04:32.000 --> 00:04:36.010
 good is a strong wake-up call 

00:04:33.800 --> 00:04:38.450
 toward 

00:04:36.010 --> 00:04:39.950
 49 years that Argentina did not start 

00:04:38.450 --> 00:04:44.110
 losing a youthful South American 

00:04:39.950 --> 00:04:44.110
 cristian equal in 64 

00:04:45.129 --> 00:04:48.330
 according to terrible 

00:04:50.600 --> 00:04:55.090
 and also already say it like that 

00:04:58.270 --> 00:05:11.889
 They hope to prevent the short good good 

00:05:04.240 --> 00:05:15.069
 two attempts I exaggerate 

00:05:11.889 --> 00:05:17.469
 had enough for that now that in 

00:05:15.069 --> 00:05:22.449
 Argentina there is not much more to say the 

00:05:17.469 --> 00:05:25.740
 scale that the son deservedly deserved 

00:05:22.449 --> 00:05:25.740
 the doubt is 

00:05:28.659 --> 00:05:35.040
 putting together and adding good players 

00:05:31.360 --> 00:05:38.370
 last you can play well 

00:05:35.040 --> 00:05:40.650
 sometimes they are good individualists and not 

00:05:38.370 --> 00:05:41.660
 Digits players lacked order to the 

00:05:40.650 --> 00:05:44.430
 team 

00:05:41.660 --> 00:05:45.390
 for sports in different places and 

00:05:44.430 --> 00:05:48.710
 all demolitions 

00:05:45.390 --> 00:05:48.710
 you have to give those guys rivers 

00:05:51.030 --> 00:05:56.190
 at school when you do what you have 

00:05:53.380 --> 00:05:58.960
 kneed corn too to tell me 

00:05:56.190 --> 00:06:03.600
 boy did not play well but play well 

00:05:58.960 --> 00:06:06.600
 of playing with the companion of 

00:06:03.600 --> 00:06:06.600
 training 

00:06:08.950 --> 00:06:12.930
 because they are players who have 

00:06:10.240 --> 00:06:12.930
 terms
