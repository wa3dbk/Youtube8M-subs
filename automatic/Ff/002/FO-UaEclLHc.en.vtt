00:00:02.320 --> 00:00:12.370
 The third pavilion you came in is the sanctuary 

00:00:06.970 --> 00:00:18.790
 This third pavilion sanctuary can be considered special. 

00:00:12.370 --> 00:00:23.259
 In front of our visit to the first exhibition hall and the second exhibition hall in the court yard 

00:00:18.790 --> 00:00:30.520
 Anyone of Israel could come in. 

00:00:23.259 --> 00:00:34.929
 But from the sanctuary here, only the priests could make it 

00:00:30.520 --> 00:00:40.829
 If so, did all these things be made by ancient Chen 2 

00:00:34.929 --> 00:00:46.079
 I too wondered angrily, including the organization of this holy life free mechanism 

00:00:40.829 --> 00:00:51.840
 It was made according to the pattern God showed to Moses 

00:00:46.079 --> 00:00:53.940
 God specifically Busan l and the only evil prisoners to make them 

00:00:51.840 --> 00:00:59.850
 You called the engineers. 

00:00:53.940 --> 00:01:01.920
 Let your ears be filled with amazing wisdom and understanding to make the instruments of the tabernacle well made . 

00:00:59.850 --> 00:01:09.380
 He said that he gave. 

00:01:01.920 --> 00:01:09.380
 Now let 's take a look at what instruments were in holy water. 

00:01:09.930 --> 00:01:17.040
 First of all, this feeling that is standing on the side of the castle that you are looking at, 

00:01:15.480 --> 00:01:22.980
 Pair 

00:01:17.040 --> 00:01:26.520
 It is a prize for putting bread, but it is not just bread , 

00:01:22.980 --> 00:01:32.860
 I put up the scruffy holy bread. 

00:01:26.520 --> 00:01:38.200
 I put all six of them on a sheet of paper 

00:01:32.860 --> 00:01:44.080
 These 12 virtues symbolize the 12 tribes of uclael 

00:01:38.200 --> 00:01:49.710
 The priests made a rice cake with a powder of insulation, 

00:01:44.080 --> 00:01:53.189
 Shanghai Rokyokdok is divided by the priests. 

00:01:49.710 --> 00:01:56.390
 How did the bosses eat Gin cellulite? 

00:01:53.189 --> 00:01:56.390
 I'm curious. 

00:01:56.910 --> 00:02:08.280
 The first one standing on the south side of the sanctuary is the back ground 

00:02:02.280 --> 00:02:13.950
 Because there are no windows for sex and there are four covers, 

00:02:08.280 --> 00:02:20.940
 I could not come in. So at this awesome light that illuminates the sanctuary, 

00:02:13.950 --> 00:02:26.700
 If not, it would be too dark for the priests to fulfill the mission. 

00:02:20.940 --> 00:02:32.790
 This awesome pure gold talc , which has been described as an apricot flower, 

00:02:26.700 --> 00:02:38.640
 In comparison with now, it is said that it made about 34 kg of gold 

00:02:32.790 --> 00:02:41.520
 This lighthouse was lit with pure oil woven from persimmon trees , 

00:02:38.640 --> 00:02:48.190
 I am said to be 

00:02:41.520 --> 00:02:52.030
 It would have been a lot of priests to keep things from going out. 

00:02:48.190 --> 00:02:57.370
 Now it's the last of holy water and there 's only one left. 

00:02:52.030 --> 00:02:58.930
 Oh holy veil on entering the Holy of Holies, the apparatus is pre-sale right in the middle 

00:02:57.370 --> 00:03:04.240
 I'm going. 

00:02:58.930 --> 00:03:09.310
 Just like his name, the fragrance of a fragrant perfume 

00:03:04.240 --> 00:03:14.800
 And is covered with pure gold like all other instruments. 

00:03:09.310 --> 00:03:16.960
 Just as the fire in the back can not be turned off , 

00:03:14.800 --> 00:03:22.630
 I had to bloom. 

00:03:16.960 --> 00:03:26.650
 The kings of wealth did not only smell of incense at the balance end, 

00:03:22.630 --> 00:03:31.450
 I prayed to God for the people of El. 

00:03:26.650 --> 00:03:37.780
 How good was the fragrance of the well-being store filled with usual 

00:03:31.450 --> 00:03:43.290
 Maybe it was a scent that could not be expressed in any words . 

00:03:37.780 --> 00:03:43.290
 I will finish all the explanations on Island 3 above.
