00:01:34.619 --> 00:01:36.350 
like pin straight but because I sort of
bleach<00:01:34.770> it<00:01:34.920> so<00:01:35.070> much<00:01:35.280> I<00:01:35.579> kind<00:01:35.909> of<00:01:35.939> get<00:01:36.150> what

00:01:36.350 --> 00:01:36.360 
bleach it so much I kind of get what

00:01:36.360 --> 00:01:37.640 
bleach it so much I kind of get what
they<00:01:36.509> call<00:01:36.720> in<00:01:36.869> the<00:01:36.960> industry<00:01:37.439> like<00:01:37.470> a

00:01:37.640 --> 00:01:37.650 
they call in the industry like a

00:01:37.650 --> 00:01:40.100 
they call in the industry like a
chemical<00:01:38.100> curl<00:01:38.490> so<00:01:39.390> it<00:01:39.509> does<00:01:39.659> have<00:01:39.869> a<00:01:39.900> little

00:01:40.100 --> 00:01:40.110 
chemical curl so it does have a little

00:01:40.110 --> 00:01:42.170 
chemical curl so it does have a little
bit<00:01:40.229> of<00:01:40.409> a<00:01:40.500> bend<00:01:40.740> to<00:01:40.890> it<00:01:41.220> naturally<00:01:41.790> what<00:01:42.090> I've

00:01:42.170 --> 00:01:42.180 
bit of a bend to it naturally what I've

00:01:42.180 --> 00:01:44.719 
bit of a bend to it naturally what I've
actually<00:01:42.420> been<00:01:42.780> doing<00:01:42.990> to<00:01:43.860> style<00:01:44.189> it<00:01:44.430> is<00:01:44.700> I
