the question mark block and do another

00:00:28.890 --> 00:00:30.560 
the question mark block and do another
backflip<00:00:29.369> and<00:00:29.519> you<00:00:29.910> should<00:00:30.060> easily<00:00:30.359> get<00:00:30.480> the

00:00:30.560 --> 00:00:30.570 
backflip and you should easily get the

green<00:00:30.750> star<00:00:34.160> second<00:00:35.160> one<00:00:35.280> is<00:00:35.570> definitely

00:00:36.560 --> 00:00:36.570 
green star second one is definitely

00:00:36.570 --> 00:00:38.510 
green star second one is definitely
quite<00:00:36.780> a<00:00:36.809> bit<00:00:37.020> trickier<00:00:37.380> to<00:00:37.410> get<00:00:37.620> you<00:00:37.800> this

00:00:38.510 --> 00:00:38.520 
quite a bit trickier to get you this

00:00:38.520 --> 00:00:40.150 
quite a bit trickier to get you this
one's<00:00:38.700> gonna<00:00:38.850> take<00:00:38.940> you<00:00:39.090> a<00:00:39.210> number<00:00:39.450> of<00:00:39.540> tries

00:00:40.150 --> 00:00:40.160 
one's gonna take you a number of tries

eat these hot peppers and you can see

00:00:45.600 --> 00:00:49.130 
eat these hot peppers and you can see
the<00:00:46.399> star<00:00:47.399> out<00:00:47.430> there<00:00:47.789> in<00:00:47.879> the<00:00:47.969> distance<00:00:48.270> and

00:00:49.130 --> 00:00:49.140 
the star out there in the distance and

00:00:49.140 --> 00:00:50.360 
the star out there in the distance and
you're<00:00:49.230> gonna<00:00:49.320> have<00:00:49.410> to<00:00:49.469> back<00:00:49.680> flip<00:00:49.950> off<00:00:50.070> Yoshi

00:00:50.360 --> 00:00:50.370 
you're gonna have to back flip off Yoshi

00:00:50.370 --> 00:00:53.299 
you're gonna have to back flip off Yoshi
to<00:00:50.550> get<00:00:50.670> enough<00:00:50.879> height<00:00:52.100> that<00:00:53.100> one's<00:00:53.250> very

00:00:53.299 --> 00:00:53.309 
to get enough height that one's very

00:00:53.309 --> 00:00:59.090 
to get enough height that one's very
tricky<00:00:54.829> to<00:00:55.829> get<00:00:55.980> the<00:00:56.460> third<00:00:56.640> one<00:00:58.039> takes<00:00:59.039> a

00:00:59.090 --> 00:00:59.100 
tricky to get the third one takes a

00:00:59.100 --> 00:01:01.040 
tricky to get the third one takes a
little<00:00:59.190> bit<00:00:59.399> of<00:00:59.489> setup<00:00:59.699> you<00:01:00.059> know<00:01:00.600> this<00:01:00.780> level

00:01:01.040 --> 00:01:01.050 
little bit of setup you know this level

00:01:01.050 --> 00:01:03.020 
little bit of setup you know this level
so<00:01:01.230> you<00:01:01.320> know<00:01:01.469> that<00:01:01.739> I<00:01:02.039> have<00:01:02.640> to<00:01:02.730> swim

00:01:03.020 --> 00:01:03.030 
so you know that I have to swim

00:01:03.030 --> 00:01:05.240 
so you know that I have to swim
underneath<00:01:03.359> this<00:01:03.960> little<00:01:04.229> hidden<00:01:04.409> area<00:01:04.799> to

00:01:05.240 --> 00:01:05.250 
underneath this little hidden area to

00:01:05.250 --> 00:01:07.910 
underneath this little hidden area to
get<00:01:06.119> to<00:01:06.210> the<00:01:06.299> top<00:01:06.510> to<00:01:06.900> hit<00:01:07.200> a<00:01:07.229> little<00:01:07.380> switch<00:01:07.680> to

00:01:07.910 --> 00:01:07.920 
get to the top to hit a little switch to

00:01:07.920 --> 00:01:11.240 
get to the top to hit a little switch to
unlock<00:01:08.280> the<00:01:08.840> cloud<00:01:09.840> flower<00:01:10.110> and<00:01:10.409> when<00:01:11.040> you<00:01:11.130> do

00:01:11.240 --> 00:01:11.250 
unlock the cloud flower and when you do

00:01:11.250 --> 00:01:13.160 
unlock the cloud flower and when you do
that<00:01:11.369> you<00:01:11.610> can<00:01:11.729> use<00:01:11.790> the<00:01:11.939> cloud<00:01:12.090> flower<00:01:12.390> you

00:01:13.160 --> 00:01:13.170 
that you can use the cloud flower you

00:01:13.170 --> 00:01:15.140 
that you can use the cloud flower you
can<00:01:13.290> see<00:01:13.409> that<00:01:13.500> little<00:01:13.650> that<00:01:14.220> little<00:01:14.250> orb<00:01:14.670> over

00:01:15.140 --> 00:01:15.150 
can see that little that little orb over

00:01:15.150 --> 00:01:16.609 
can see that little that little orb over
there<00:01:15.299> in<00:01:15.420> the<00:01:15.509> corner<00:01:15.689> that<00:01:15.900> you<00:01:15.990> can<00:01:16.140> spin

00:01:16.609 --> 00:01:16.619 
there in the corner that you can spin

00:01:16.619 --> 00:01:19.609 
there in the corner that you can spin
around<00:01:17.810> which<00:01:18.810> is<00:01:18.930> where<00:01:19.110> you<00:01:19.200> had<00:01:19.350> to<00:01:19.439> go<00:01:19.560> to

00:01:19.609 --> 00:01:19.619 
around which is where you had to go to

00:01:19.619 --> 00:01:20.990 
around which is where you had to go to
get<00:01:19.799> one<00:01:19.950> of<00:01:20.009> the<00:01:20.100> Silver<00:01:20.400> Star<00:01:20.610> as<00:01:20.729> I<00:01:20.850> believe

get one of the Silver Star as I believe

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:24.080 
get one of the Silver Star as I believe
on<00:01:21.270> a<00:01:21.299> previous<00:01:21.750> level<00:01:22.020> anyway<00:01:22.909> when<00:01:23.909> you<00:01:23.970> have

on a previous level anyway when you have

00:01:24.090 --> 00:01:26.330 
on a previous level anyway when you have
the<00:01:24.180> cloud<00:01:24.360> flower<00:01:24.659> you<00:01:25.110> can<00:01:25.140> bounce<00:01:26.100> on<00:01:26.220> the

the cloud flower you can bounce on the

00:01:26.340 --> 00:01:29.210 
the cloud flower you can bounce on the
trampoline<00:01:26.369> and<00:01:27.500> spin<00:01:28.500> at<00:01:28.860> the<00:01:28.950> height<00:01:29.189> of

00:01:29.210 --> 00:01:29.220 
trampoline and spin at the height of

00:01:29.220 --> 00:01:31.310 
trampoline and spin at the height of
your<00:01:29.369> jump<00:01:29.670> three<00:01:30.210> times<00:01:30.240> to<00:01:30.869> get<00:01:30.960> up<00:01:31.079> enough

00:01:31.310 --> 00:01:31.320 
your jump three times to get up enough

00:01:31.320 --> 00:01:36.469 
your jump three times to get up enough
height<00:01:31.470> to<00:01:31.680> do<00:01:31.920> one<00:01:32.159> more<00:01:32.310> backflip<00:01:32.729> and<00:01:35.479> get
