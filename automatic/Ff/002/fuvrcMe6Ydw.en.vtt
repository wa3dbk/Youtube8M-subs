00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:09.410
 It was good beauty people in this video I go 

00:00:03.990 --> 00:00:13.290
 show you how you will decrease 

00:00:09.410 --> 00:00:15.150
 to each type of storage 

00:00:13.290 --> 00:00:17.550
 It was very crowded, you guys are going to do this. 

00:00:15.150 --> 00:00:20.970
 I'm talking here you and you're going 

00:00:17.550 --> 00:00:21.660
 clean sheik storage has in its 

00:00:20.970 --> 00:00:24.810
 cell phone 

00:00:21.660 --> 00:00:26.490
 good first step you will make you 

00:00:24.810 --> 00:00:29.250
 will see that it will configure in your 

00:00:26.490 --> 00:00:34.530
 setup kick you will me 

00:00:29.250 --> 00:00:37.280
 storage on the device part and 

00:00:34.530 --> 00:00:40.770
 You will see that while you are 

00:00:37.280 --> 00:00:44.040
 need attacked calculating I have 

00:00:40.770 --> 00:00:48.840
 a sd eta card and what will show the 

00:00:44.040 --> 00:00:53.329
 You 're to get the memory full of 

00:00:48.840 --> 00:00:53.329
 own side storage of the dream screen 

00:00:53.600 --> 00:01:04.110
 and mine this here and how you can 

00:00:58.109 --> 00:01:05.810
 view and shake to show the data 

00:01:04.110 --> 00:01:10.090
 on here 

00:01:05.810 --> 00:01:10.090
 He will give you the percentage. 

00:01:11.979 --> 00:01:16.990
 calculating 

00:01:14.060 --> 00:01:16.990
 to calculate 

00:01:21.659 --> 00:01:24.969
 good people 

00:01:23.740 --> 00:01:27.280
 We'll come back later, and we will not 

00:01:24.969 --> 00:01:33.250
 you need not see but most 

00:01:27.280 --> 00:01:35.289
 of times applications is that people 

00:01:33.250 --> 00:01:39.100
 make us want here application data 

00:01:35.289 --> 00:01:40.780
 bar content and will enter very much 

00:01:39.100 --> 00:01:42.220
 very much you will not see every day 

00:01:40.780 --> 00:01:45.909
 You will clear the cell phone memory. 

00:01:42.220 --> 00:01:51.159
 like mine and says not all to hit the 

00:01:45.909 --> 00:01:54.299
 local team right 

00:01:51.159 --> 00:01:54.299
 I already assumed up there. 

00:01:54.750 --> 00:02:07.900
 hope droid has a first app 

00:01:58.720 --> 00:02:10.509
 must be customer neri expects to calculate a 

00:02:07.900 --> 00:02:13.360
 Many people 's mistake is when it comes here. 

00:02:10.509 --> 00:02:15.670
 they click clear data 

00:02:13.360 --> 00:02:17.590
 If you are going to clean the data, you will 

00:02:15.670 --> 00:02:21.820
 lose everything you have saved 

00:02:17.590 --> 00:02:24.090
 in this app honest ok left there by 

00:02:21.820 --> 00:02:26.740
 This is what we have to clear the cache 

00:02:24.090 --> 00:02:29.650
 which is the cache about what is right 

00:02:26.740 --> 00:02:34.209
 what is taking up the agent needed 

00:02:29.650 --> 00:02:43.570
 We have to pay a small fee. 

00:02:34.209 --> 00:02:47.590
 call a good turn and go the other way and 

00:02:43.570 --> 00:02:49.930
 click on parkash just take here is 

00:02:47.590 --> 00:02:54.070
 100 because I just recently did that 

00:02:49.930 --> 00:02:56.590
 I did it, it was for mine or mine. 

00:02:54.070 --> 00:02:59.110
 antivirus which can also be good then 

00:02:56.590 --> 00:03:03.790
 You want to learn how to do everything. 

00:02:59.110 --> 00:03:08.910
 This does not only come with antivirus just ask 

00:03:03.790 --> 00:03:08.910
 in check 

00:03:09.600 --> 00:03:19.800
 do not say no and inpar cache example 

00:03:20.130 --> 00:03:23.790
 and I did not use 

00:03:25.770 --> 00:03:32.250
 Good people, you're going to do this in all 

00:03:28.410 --> 00:03:34.350
 these apps sure you will free 

00:03:32.250 --> 00:03:36.690
 plenty of memory here 

00:03:34.350 --> 00:03:37.980
 I hope you liked it until 

00:03:36.690 --> 00:03:40.200

00:03:40.200 --> 00:03:45.120
 You kisses if you want me to 

00:03:42.930 --> 00:03:47.010
 teach you how the impact of 

00:03:45.120 --> 00:03:52.280
