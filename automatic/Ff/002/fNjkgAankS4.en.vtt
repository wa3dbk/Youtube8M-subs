00:01:50.929 --> 00:01:50.939 
see at the minute is that we just aren't

00:01:50.939 --> 00:01:53.690 
see at the minute is that we just aren't
getting<00:01:51.390> the<00:01:52.229> quality<00:01:52.500> products<00:01:53.460> that<00:01:53.579> people

really<00:01:57.210> viable<00:01:57.570> to<00:01:58.110> release<00:01:58.439> blu-rays

00:01:59.060 --> 00:01:59.070 
really viable to release blu-rays

00:01:59.070 --> 00:02:02.330 
really viable to release blu-rays
anymore<00:01:59.909> and<00:02:00.180> the<00:02:00.750> only<00:02:00.869> time<00:02:01.200> we<00:02:01.469> ever<00:02:01.500> do<00:02:02.009> get

anymore and the only time we ever do get
blu-ray<00:02:02.729> releases<00:02:03.000> is<00:02:03.360> generally<00:02:04.259> when<00:02:04.790> manga

00:02:29.100 --> 00:02:29.110 
of not by a show especially in the UK

00:02:29.110 --> 00:02:32.300 
of not by a show especially in the UK
because<00:02:29.920> our<00:02:30.580> anime<00:02:31.000> is<00:02:31.239> so<00:02:31.540> cheap<00:02:31.840> to

00:02:32.300 --> 00:02:32.310 
because our anime is so cheap to

00:02:32.310 --> 00:02:34.860 
because our anime is so cheap to
everywhere<00:02:33.310> else<00:02:33.489> in<00:02:33.670> the<00:02:33.700> world<00:02:33.910> for<00:02:34.239> example

everywhere else in the world for example

00:02:34.870 --> 00:02:38.100 
everywhere else in the world for example
America<00:02:35.860> Japan<00:02:36.160> Australia<00:02:36.819> they<00:02:37.660> all<00:02:37.870> pay<00:02:38.080> a

00:02:38.100 --> 00:02:38.110 
America Japan Australia they all pay a

00:02:38.110 --> 00:02:40.050 
America Japan Australia they all pay a
lot<00:02:38.349> more<00:02:38.379> money<00:02:38.620> than<00:02:38.769> we<00:02:39.129> do<00:02:39.310> but<00:02:39.879> people

00:02:40.050 --> 00:02:40.060 
lot more money than we do but people

00:02:40.060 --> 00:02:42.000 
lot more money than we do but people
still<00:02:40.390> don't<00:02:40.540> buy<00:02:40.930> anime<00:02:41.500> here<00:02:41.799> and<00:02:41.920> I'm<00:02:41.980> not

still don't buy anime here and I'm not

00:02:42.010 --> 00:02:44.130 
still don't buy anime here and I'm not
quite<00:02:42.370> sure<00:02:42.400> why<00:02:42.819> I<00:02:43.120> can<00:02:43.390> really<00:02:43.599> understand

00:02:44.130 --> 00:02:44.140 
quite sure why I can really understand

00:02:44.140 --> 00:02:46.020 
quite sure why I can really understand
if<00:02:44.380> you<00:02:44.560> can't<00:02:44.769> buy<00:02:45.040> series<00:02:45.519> because<00:02:45.819> you

00:02:46.020 --> 00:02:46.030 
if you can't buy series because you

00:02:46.030 --> 00:02:48.120 
if you can't buy series because you
don't<00:02:46.269> have<00:02:46.599> it<00:02:46.780> or<00:02:46.989> it's<00:02:47.440> out<00:02:47.620> of<00:02:47.650> print<00:02:47.920> and

don't have it or it's out of print and

00:02:48.130 --> 00:02:49.830 
don't have it or it's out of print and
it's<00:02:48.459> really<00:02:48.700> expensive<00:02:48.880> to<00:02:49.209> get<00:02:49.450> because<00:02:49.780> I

00:02:49.830 --> 00:02:49.840 
it's really expensive to get because I

00:02:49.840 --> 00:02:52.380 
it's really expensive to get because I
understand<00:02:50.880> sometimes<00:02:51.880> it's<00:02:52.090> just<00:02:52.150> not

00:02:52.380 --> 00:02:52.390 
understand sometimes it's just not

00:02:52.390 --> 00:02:54.990 
understand sometimes it's just not
viable<00:02:52.720> to<00:02:53.260> spend<00:02:53.500> so<00:02:53.739> much<00:02:53.860> money<00:02:54.069> on<00:02:54.220> one

00:02:54.990 --> 00:02:55.000 
viable to spend so much money on one

00:02:55.000 --> 00:02:57.900 
viable to spend so much money on one
like<00:02:55.690> single<00:02:56.230> DVD<00:02:56.440> but<00:02:57.099> when<00:02:57.310> it's<00:02:57.489> like<00:02:57.730> on

amazon for three pounds 15 for a film I
don't<00:03:01.239> understand<00:03:01.629> why<00:03:01.720> people<00:03:01.750> just<00:03:02.230> don't

00:03:02.430 --> 00:03:02.440 
don't understand why people just don't

00:03:02.440 --> 00:03:04.380 
don't understand why people just don't
buy<00:03:02.769> it<00:03:02.829> because<00:03:03.129> that's<00:03:03.430> so<00:03:03.640> cheap<00:03:03.879> I<00:03:04.000> don't

00:03:04.380 --> 00:03:04.390 
buy it because that's so cheap I don't

00:03:04.390 --> 00:03:06.630 
buy it because that's so cheap I don't
know<00:03:04.510> I'm<00:03:04.720> just<00:03:04.750> very<00:03:05.110> not<00:03:05.650> understanding<00:03:06.519> of
