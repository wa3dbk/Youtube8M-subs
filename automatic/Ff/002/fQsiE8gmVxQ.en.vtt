00:04:16.650 --> 00:04:16.660 
leave everything just like it is at

00:04:16.660 --> 00:04:18.810 
leave everything just like it is at
Daytona<00:04:17.229> and<00:04:17.320> Talladega<00:04:17.609> until<00:04:18.609> there's

00:04:18.810 --> 00:04:18.820 
Daytona and Talladega until there's

00:04:18.820 --> 00:04:20.729

00:04:24.180 --> 00:04:24.190 
I think the racing at Daytona is fine

00:04:24.190 --> 00:04:26.130 
I think the racing at Daytona is fine

bit when you get to Talladega because

00:04:27.520 --> 00:04:29.100 
bit when you get to Talladega because
