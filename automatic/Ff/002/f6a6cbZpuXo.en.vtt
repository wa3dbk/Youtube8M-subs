00:00:33.690 --> 00:00:41.130 

big<00:00:34.690> night<00:00:34.870> noise<00:00:35.140> that<00:00:35.260> over<00:00:35.440> this

00:00:41.130 --> 00:00:41.140 

00:00:41.140 --> 00:00:47.869 

Drock<00:00:42.100> yep

00:00:47.869 --> 00:00:47.879 

00:00:47.879 --> 00:00:51.500 

we<00:00:48.120> understand<00:00:48.600> speed<00:00:49.940> to<00:00:50.940> be<00:00:51.059> honest<00:00:51.359> in<00:00:51.480> the

00:00:51.500 --> 00:00:51.510 
we understand speed to be honest in the

00:00:51.510 --> 00:00:52.700 
we understand speed to be honest in the
last<00:00:51.750> one<00:00:51.989> because<00:00:52.109> their<00:00:52.289> car<00:00:52.469> was<00:00:52.589> actually

00:00:52.700 --> 00:00:52.710 
last one because their car was actually

00:00:52.710 --> 00:00:54.829 
last one because their car was actually
a<00:00:53.070> slow<00:00:53.670> down<00:00:53.820> to<00:00:53.910> about<00:00:54.059> 70<00:00:54.480> I<00:00:54.510> didn't<00:00:54.719> get

00:00:54.829 --> 00:00:54.839 
a slow down to about 70 I didn't get

00:00:54.839 --> 00:00:56.630 
a slow down to about 70 I didn't get
didn't<00:00:55.260> do<00:00:55.320> anything<00:00:55.589> so<00:00:56.010> I<00:00:56.039> won't<00:00:56.370> you<00:00:56.489> do

00:00:56.630 --> 00:00:56.640 
didn't do anything so I won't you do

00:00:56.640 --> 00:00:58.709 
didn't do anything so I won't you do
that<00:00:56.820> this<00:00:57.030> time

00:00:58.709 --> 00:00:58.719 
that this time

00:00:58.719 --> 00:01:14.149 
that this time
so<00:00:59.109> this<00:00:59.230> would<00:00:59.410> be<00:00:59.559> faster

00:01:14.149 --> 00:01:14.159 

00:01:14.159 --> 00:01:19.310 

it<00:01:14.490> does

00:01:19.310 --> 00:01:19.320 

00:01:19.320 --> 00:01:20.930 

maybe<00:01:19.800> through<00:01:20.040> the<00:01:20.190> corners<00:01:20.490> you<00:01:20.520> can't<00:01:20.760> get

00:01:20.930 --> 00:01:20.940 
maybe through the corners you can't get

00:01:20.940 --> 00:01:35.460 
maybe through the corners you can't get
at<00:01:21.030> our<00:01:21.180> noise<00:01:21.360> doesn't<00:01:22.110> want<00:01:22.350> to<00:01:22.410> push<00:01:22.560> it

00:01:35.460 --> 00:01:35.470 

00:01:35.470 --> 00:02:13.600 

six-four

00:02:13.600 --> 00:02:13.610 

00:02:13.610 --> 00:02:14.740 

this<00:02:13.940> will<00:02:14.060> be<00:02:14.150> the<00:02:14.240> one<00:02:14.330> that<00:02:14.450> you'd<00:02:14.570> really

00:02:14.740 --> 00:02:14.750 
this will be the one that you'd really

00:02:14.750 --> 00:02:17.140 
this will be the one that you'd really

yeah okay big difference what you're
saying<00:03:23.850> is<00:03:24.090> my<00:03:24.270> steering<00:03:24.660> technique<00:03:25.130> my

00:03:26.120 --> 00:03:26.130 
saying is my steering technique my

00:03:26.130 --> 00:03:33.530 
saying is my steering technique my
shoulders<00:03:26.490> don't<00:03:26.640> come<00:03:26.760> out<00:03:27.000> of<00:03:27.120> the<00:03:27.180> st.<00:03:32.540> okay

00:03:33.530 --> 00:03:33.540 
shoulders don't come out of the st. okay

00:03:33.540 --> 00:03:35.060 
shoulders don't come out of the st. okay
so<00:03:33.600> we'll<00:03:33.900> start<00:03:33.990> from<00:03:34.290> here<00:03:34.530> this<00:03:34.830> one's

00:03:35.060 --> 00:03:35.070 
so we'll start from here this one's

00:03:35.070 --> 00:03:37.370 
so we'll start from here this one's
quite<00:03:35.250> easy<00:03:35.570> the<00:03:36.570> big<00:03:36.780> difference<00:03:37.110> in<00:03:37.260> the

00:03:37.370 --> 00:03:37.380 
quite easy the big difference in the

00:03:37.380 --> 00:03:39.380 
quite easy the big difference in the
tires<00:03:37.620> here<00:03:38.070> is<00:03:38.160> discount<00:03:38.640> for<00:03:38.790> sizes<00:03:39.240> and

00:03:39.380 --> 00:03:39.390 
tires here is discount for sizes and

00:03:39.390 --> 00:03:41.300 
tires here is discount for sizes and
powers<00:03:39.690> off<00:03:39.840> center<00:03:40.230> did<00:03:41.100> you<00:03:41.190> actually

00:03:41.300 --> 00:03:41.310 
powers off center did you actually

00:03:41.310 --> 00:03:42.610 
powers off center did you actually
notice<00:03:41.700> much<00:03:41.850> difference

00:03:42.610 --> 00:03:42.620 
notice much difference

00:04:48.779 --> 00:04:48.789 
tell me what our speed is when we go

00:04:48.789 --> 00:04:50.939 
tell me what our speed is when we go
past<00:04:49.030> the<00:04:49.330> last<00:04:49.599> cone<00:04:49.990> and<00:04:50.259> then<00:04:50.680> we<00:04:50.770> can

00:04:50.939 --> 00:04:50.949 
past the last cone and then we can

00:04:50.949 --> 00:04:52.860 
past the last cone and then we can
compare<00:04:51.310> it<00:04:51.400> with<00:04:51.430> the<00:04:51.610> other<00:04:51.729> car<00:04:52.030> and<00:04:52.270> if<00:04:52.750> you

compare it with the other car and if you
can<00:04:53.050> tell<00:04:53.259> me<00:04:53.440> what<00:04:53.710> the<00:04:53.860> maximum<00:04:54.280> steering

00:04:54.600 --> 00:04:54.610 
can tell me what the maximum steering

00:04:54.610 --> 00:04:57.119 
can tell me what the maximum steering
the<00:04:55.210> maximum<00:04:55.629> number<00:04:55.930> you<00:04:56.110> see<00:04:56.349> and<00:04:56.830> that'll

00:04:57.119 --> 00:04:57.129 
the maximum number you see and that'll

00:04:57.129 --> 00:05:08.670 
the maximum number you see and that'll
give<00:04:57.280> us<00:04:57.370> a<00:04:57.520> comparison<00:04:58.210> for<00:04:58.389> steering<00:05:07.680> ever

00:05:08.670 --> 00:05:08.680 
give us a comparison for steering ever

00:05:08.680 --> 00:05:19.950 
give us a comparison for steering ever
to<00:05:08.979> keep<00:05:09.310> our<00:05:09.460> speed<00:05:09.729> at<00:05:09.880> 65<00:05:18.000> okay<00:05:19.000> here<00:05:19.509> we<00:05:19.599> go

00:05:19.950 --> 00:05:19.960 
to keep our speed at 65 okay here we go

00:05:19.960 --> 00:05:31.950 
to keep our speed at 65 okay here we go
about<00:05:20.409> fifty<00:05:20.800> to<00:05:20.949> forty<00:05:21.400> seven<00:05:21.699> of<00:05:21.759> us<00:05:21.849> okay
