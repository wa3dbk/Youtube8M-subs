00:00:03.660 --> 00:00:07.850
 I think it suits us quite well 

00:00:05.700 --> 00:00:10.090
 comes 

00:00:07.850 --> 00:00:12.290
 where you are coming in a mentality 

00:00:10.090 --> 00:00:14.960
 important 

00:00:12.290 --> 00:00:16.630
 and so we have to continue 

00:00:14.960 --> 00:00:20.070
 the team was completely 

00:00:16.630 --> 00:00:22.000
 convinced or decided 

00:00:20.070 --> 00:00:25.180
 of security 

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:28.230
 each one and giving as teams two so 

00:00:25.180 --> 00:00:30.890
 we must continue and not have here 

00:00:28.230 --> 00:00:30.890
 in things 

00:00:32.950 --> 00:00:37.650
 the two teams made the merits 

00:00:34.570 --> 00:00:37.650
 to get there 

00:00:38.020 --> 00:00:42.700
 has a law and may america 

00:00:40.030 --> 00:00:44.329
 I also think that it is an energy of 

00:00:42.700 --> 00:00:46.399
 key couple 

00:00:44.329 --> 00:00:48.980
 a deputy and I hope that well played by 

00:00:46.399 --> 00:00:51.800
 part of timely normally 

00:00:48.980 --> 00:00:53.989
 that I had to score but we know that 

00:00:51.800 --> 00:00:56.570
 we have to eat more minimally is this 

00:00:53.989 --> 00:00:58.370
 How good we do here to break 

00:00:56.570 --> 00:01:01.039
 try to break that marking the league 

00:00:58.370 --> 00:01:02.960
 of 15 years without book cantons so is 

00:01:01.039 --> 00:01:06.020
 and I think right now we are very well 

00:01:02.960 --> 00:01:07.300
 we are very very compact very complete 

00:01:06.020 --> 00:01:09.070
 on the line so 

00:01:07.300 --> 00:01:12.670
 you can talk about making two matches 

00:01:09.070 --> 00:01:14.710
 perfect so is I say get a good 

00:01:12.670 --> 00:01:16.240
 advantage here at home and good after 

00:01:14.710 --> 00:01:17.890
 thanks to a great match also a 

00:01:16.240 --> 00:01:20.070
 great travel tourism to get to the 

00:01:17.890 --> 00:01:20.070
 final 

00:01:20.909 --> 00:01:26.909
 we suffer a lot during the tournament but the 

00:01:24.179 --> 00:01:29.189
 goal was to play the cup we won and 

00:01:26.909 --> 00:01:32.150
 get to the final 

00:01:29.189 --> 00:01:35.120
 we are the final with a rival 

00:01:32.150 --> 00:01:37.340
 in america, which was the most regular 

00:01:35.120 --> 00:01:39.050
 tournament that is going to be a match one 

00:01:37.340 --> 00:01:41.060
 very beautiful final what flavor has to be 

00:01:39.050 --> 00:01:43.000
 has found america people can be 

00:01:41.060 --> 00:01:45.200
 special obviously because it's a classic 

00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:47.690
 a long time not giving a 

00:01:45.200 --> 00:01:49.550
 classic in this way national two 

00:01:47.690 --> 00:01:52.010
 equipment that come when it is well 

00:01:49.550 --> 00:01:53.830
 Really 

00:01:52.010 --> 00:01:56.110
 I believe that 

00:01:53.830 --> 00:01:59.230
 the two teams that did the best 

00:01:56.110 --> 00:02:01.990
 things in the classics I just said no 

00:01:59.230 --> 00:02:03.630
 there is a favorite imane a final 

00:02:01.990 --> 00:02:08.000
 there 

00:02:03.630 --> 00:02:08.000
 you play the pride of playing it 

00:02:08.039 --> 00:02:12.629
 for people a more important game 

00:02:10.560 --> 00:02:15.719
 and well you do not have to prove it I think 

00:02:12.629 --> 00:02:16.980
 are the teams that go to the front I 

00:02:15.719 --> 00:02:18.510
 I think these two parties are not going to be 

00:02:16.980 --> 00:02:20.189
 the exception after good as I say 

00:02:18.510 --> 00:02:22.140
 diego that wins the one that better plays like 

00:02:20.189 --> 00:02:24.000
 favorite if it's true the team 

00:02:22.140 --> 00:02:26.909
 well doing things very well now 

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:29.579
 that now that maintain that form of 

00:02:26.909 --> 00:02:32.250
 game is this feeling of thought 

00:02:29.579 --> 00:02:34.530
 to be supportive and seek to harm them 

00:02:32.250 --> 00:02:36.599
 when they place you imagine playing the 180 

00:02:34.530 --> 00:02:37.950
 minutes more protected medical sector be 

00:02:36.599 --> 00:02:40.500
 smart and intelligent to handle 

00:02:37.950 --> 00:02:42.629
 well the times of the match and he arrived 

00:02:40.500 --> 00:02:44.250
 search detected to detect their 

00:02:42.629 --> 00:02:46.079
 weaknesses for why a while ago I 

00:02:44.250 --> 00:02:48.490
 I would like it healthy to congratulate the 

00:02:46.079 --> 00:02:51.580
 blue cross team 

00:02:48.490 --> 00:02:53.890
 being a wine they won at the end with everything 

00:02:51.580 --> 00:02:55.410
 merit I think mistakes are paid very 

00:02:53.890 --> 00:02:56.970
 clear 

00:02:55.410 --> 00:03:00.300
 parties like our people 

00:02:56.970 --> 00:03:03.750
 eliminated did not take the merit for us 

00:03:00.300 --> 00:03:06.090
 cross but sure and all that are 

00:03:03.750 --> 00:03:07.710
 here maybe they agree with me that if 

00:03:06.090 --> 00:03:10.590
 not making so many mistakes would be a 

00:03:07.710 --> 00:03:13.980
 series very couple more more couple already what 

00:03:10.590 --> 00:03:16.170
 better would be 50% for each of the 

00:03:13.980 --> 00:03:19.280
 equipment but good football is like that there 

00:03:16.170 --> 00:03:19.280
 that be live with that
