00:00:00.270 --> 00:00:05.609
 well this is how the line would look 

00:00:03.149 --> 00:00:07.080
 done and it had already been mounted but 

00:00:05.609 --> 00:00:09.240
 we are going to be like this one that already 

00:00:07.080 --> 00:00:12.510
 it's empty first we start by cutting a 

00:00:09.240 --> 00:00:15.870
 chub book well after about 4 meters and 

00:00:12.510 --> 00:00:21.480
 then another thing is to take a tube of this 

00:00:15.870 --> 00:00:23.180
 because the game inside for 

00:00:21.480 --> 00:00:27.210
 support that they sell from the fishing shop 

00:00:23.180 --> 00:00:31.579
 then I will use it in this one 

00:00:27.210 --> 00:00:31.579
 first cubes are picked 

00:00:36.500 --> 00:00:41.969
 cachito 

00:00:39.300 --> 00:00:45.090
 and that's not going to be left over a bit and that's where 

00:00:41.969 --> 00:00:50.510
 would cut a few little cases like this 

00:00:45.090 --> 00:00:50.510
 cut two more 

00:00:56.500 --> 00:01:00.660
 one time he gave me some of the gold 

00:01:03.990 --> 00:01:09.690
 once done that he puts his cock and 

00:01:07.260 --> 00:01:11.790
 the usual metal that you have here is 

00:01:09.690 --> 00:01:16.500
 put the thread 

00:01:11.790 --> 00:01:21.560
 he throws himself a little to marry him 

00:01:16.500 --> 00:01:21.560
 and we throw it from below 

00:01:25.760 --> 00:01:31.610
 first I want for home do not forget 

00:01:28.700 --> 00:01:35.530
 once found tubes that was 

00:01:31.610 --> 00:01:35.530
 here then dry 

00:01:37.220 --> 00:01:40.220
 there 

00:01:41.390 --> 00:01:44.890
 after it is getting and 

00:01:45.730 --> 00:01:50.790
 once he gave me one and we go up 

00:01:59.810 --> 00:02:03.619
 and we put the other 

00:02:15.180 --> 00:02:21.989
 once we had we already have a lot 

00:02:18.840 --> 00:02:23.069
 buoy we're book is strong and 

00:02:21.989 --> 00:02:24.990
 we have here 

00:02:23.069 --> 00:02:27.720
 I'm going to grab 

00:02:24.990 --> 00:02:31.530
 once that's done you look at the resort that 

00:02:27.720 --> 00:02:33.930
 has the buoy here we see that it has a 12 

00:02:31.530 --> 00:02:36.500
 12 grams then change that by air 

00:02:33.930 --> 00:02:36.500
 we close it 

00:02:38.780 --> 00:02:44.420
 they usually reach up to 60 

00:02:46.040 --> 00:02:49.040
 25 

00:02:49.340 --> 00:02:53.750
 although we must also say this 

00:02:51.709 --> 00:02:59.800
 depth we can not have it almost 

00:02:53.750 --> 00:02:59.800
 falling on the lake we took 2 

00:03:02.720 --> 00:03:07.850
 once done that we put it below 

00:03:06.200 --> 00:03:11.200
 of the cock 

00:03:07.850 --> 00:03:11.200
 the hairline is sought 

00:03:11.270 --> 00:03:16.810
 but I can not 

00:03:21.110 --> 00:03:26.020
 once I am conscious 

00:03:34.670 --> 00:03:42.730
 a little bit bigger is measured now I see 

00:03:37.450 --> 00:03:42.730
 like a 70 is fine 

00:03:58.950 --> 00:04:04.129
 it tightens as it feels strong 

00:04:01.730 --> 00:04:08.239
 what we have a very good any 

00:04:04.129 --> 00:04:10.459
 thing now once done that we can see 

00:04:08.239 --> 00:04:13.340
 the floors we are going to shape 

00:04:10.459 --> 00:04:15.890
 duel of them of motorcycle of all the fuero 

00:04:13.340 --> 00:04:19.989
 we will take one of the measure 

00:04:15.890 --> 00:04:21.510
 10 9 

00:04:19.989 --> 00:04:25.700
 they have done that to me 

00:04:21.510 --> 00:04:25.700
 was the thread the end 

00:04:27.760 --> 00:04:33.600
 there comes a special way it would be around here 

00:04:36.300 --> 00:04:42.150
 like these branches of the horra and they 

00:04:39.449 --> 00:04:45.300
 we put the turns one 

00:04:42.150 --> 00:04:49.460
 and 2 has not done that let's say strong 

00:04:45.300 --> 00:04:53.889
 strong strong and this west is almost better 

00:04:49.460 --> 00:04:57.759
 this already almost indestructible 

00:04:53.889 --> 00:04:59.340
 the carp very good for carp of 9 kilos 

00:04:57.759 --> 00:05:02.010
 Y 

00:04:59.340 --> 00:05:04.370
 we see that I am doing strength and I do not know 

00:05:02.010 --> 00:05:04.370
 loose 

00:05:05.020 --> 00:05:10.979
 we put a scissors 

00:05:07.689 --> 00:05:10.979
 we cut the tip 

00:05:13.780 --> 00:05:20.150
 we lower the lead a little 

00:05:16.500 --> 00:05:20.150
 collapse now we go down a bit 

00:05:21.449 --> 00:05:27.599
 I 'm going to put this because lately 

00:05:24.029 --> 00:05:30.479
 I'm trying cygan since a 

00:05:27.599 --> 00:05:34.740
 as yes 

00:05:30.479 --> 00:05:34.740
 for this 

00:05:35.490 --> 00:05:39.270
 he is also shot dina 

00:05:42.900 --> 00:05:49.330
 once the cry is made by 

00:05:46.660 --> 00:05:51.270
 above that as the others we give you the 

00:05:49.330 --> 00:05:56.240
 return 

00:05:51.270 --> 00:05:56.240
 we throw and make a new normal 

00:05:58.350 --> 00:06:05.129
 that this is what I am using a 

00:06:01.050 --> 00:06:08.179
 little hard then it 's hard to manage 

00:06:05.129 --> 00:06:08.179
 it pulls strong 

00:06:08.260 --> 00:06:12.059
 side brooches 

00:06:10.289 --> 00:06:14.449
 we already had a lot now we return the 

00:06:12.059 --> 00:06:14.449
 scissors 

00:06:17.200 --> 00:06:23.080
 once done that we see the line of the 

00:06:21.400 --> 00:06:25.330
 most lines well with a piquito 

00:06:23.080 --> 00:06:27.030
 up here if it does not come when it's 

00:06:25.330 --> 00:06:29.530
 we hook directly by the acuero 

00:06:27.030 --> 00:06:32.400
 we'll put it here we think about it and 

00:06:29.530 --> 00:06:32.400
 we are rolling 

00:06:33.480 --> 00:06:38.060
 If I go to what is good for the 

00:06:35.220 --> 00:06:38.060
 a little and measure 

00:06:38.569 --> 00:06:41.589
 if not me 

00:06:49.580 --> 00:06:53.059
 down 

00:06:53.849 --> 00:06:56.869
 like the pineapple 

00:07:00.420 --> 00:07:06.360
 let's be there and think hard 

00:07:03.900 --> 00:07:08.660
 until trying to fit it in this 

00:07:06.360 --> 00:07:08.660
 small 

00:07:13.620 --> 00:07:17.270
 I have not done that would be more diva 

00:07:22.430 --> 00:07:26.350
 and I would have a lot of prepared line
