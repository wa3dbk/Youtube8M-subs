00:02:26.360 --> 00:02:30.190
 like a pink glass 

00:02:30.370 --> 00:02:38.520
 this is like a meter to mix 

00:02:34.810 --> 00:02:38.520
 a small spoon 

00:02:38.600 --> 00:02:42.100
 a little side step 

00:02:43.650 --> 00:02:48.840
 one more teaspoon and this is for the 

00:02:47.069 --> 00:02:51.599
 chocolate for the external for the 

00:02:48.840 --> 00:02:54.360
 Chocolate glaze and it's like a 

00:02:51.599 --> 00:02:56.760
 dropper and let's start doing the 

00:02:54.360 --> 00:03:00.659
 mix for the solÃ­stica ice cream there is that 

00:02:56.760 --> 00:03:04.920

00:03:00.659 --> 00:03:07.730

00:03:04.920 --> 00:03:07.730
 let's fill it 

00:03:08.870 --> 00:03:11.860
 little by little 

00:03:10.610 --> 00:03:13.410
 [Music] 

00:03:11.860 --> 00:03:16.170
 ah 

00:03:13.410 --> 00:03:17.460
 and yes you have to put two tablespoons of 

00:03:16.170 --> 00:03:20.810
 Water 

00:03:17.460 --> 00:03:23.080
 although we are going to put a 

00:03:20.810 --> 00:03:25.300
 and 2 

00:03:23.080 --> 00:03:31.660
 and to mix 

00:03:25.300 --> 00:03:35.050
 [Music] 

00:03:31.660 --> 00:03:36.850
 if it seems like a lot because in a 

00:03:35.050 --> 00:03:38.590
 pudding 

00:03:36.850 --> 00:03:41.680
 and now let's mix the mixture of 

00:03:38.590 --> 00:03:46.180
 chocolate and something funny is super 

00:03:41.680 --> 00:03:48.010
 cold I do not know what it has inside but when 

00:03:46.180 --> 00:03:50.740
 the man has mixed I realized 

00:03:48.010 --> 00:03:54.130
 that this one even super cold in the mix 

00:03:50.740 --> 00:03:56.569
 so let's now be chocolate one of 

00:03:54.130 --> 00:03:59.709
 chocolate 

00:03:56.569 --> 00:03:59.709
 and one of water 

00:04:04.150 --> 00:04:14.600
 well and mix 

00:04:07.780 --> 00:04:14.600
 [Music] 

00:04:17.290 --> 00:04:22.780
 and here are our chocolate photos 

00:04:20.160 --> 00:04:24.240
 although now he says that we have to get the 

00:04:22.780 --> 00:04:28.520
 cap 

00:04:24.240 --> 00:04:28.520
 and put the mixture on the side here 

00:04:28.550 --> 00:04:37.090
 [Music] 

00:04:34.280 --> 00:04:40.780
 now we are going to cover it 

00:04:37.090 --> 00:04:44.970
 and move the little button here and let's see 

00:04:40.780 --> 00:04:44.970
 how the ice cream comes out from below 

00:04:48.060 --> 00:04:53.169
 [Music] 

00:04:50.569 --> 00:04:53.169
 Y 

00:04:54.250 --> 00:04:57.339
 [Music] 

00:04:57.919 --> 00:05:03.990
 because it is 

00:05:00.550 --> 00:05:07.170
 [Music] 

00:05:03.990 --> 00:05:08.760
 let's decorate it with chocolate and a 

00:05:07.170 --> 00:05:10.770
 little mirrors 

00:05:08.760 --> 00:05:13.670
 let's use the cotero that came and in 

00:05:10.770 --> 00:05:13.670
 this chocolate 

00:05:13.830 --> 00:05:16.050
 here 

00:05:14.750 --> 00:05:20.539
 [Music] 

00:05:16.050 --> 00:05:20.539
 and throw it in our rich ice cream 

00:05:23.880 --> 00:05:28.020
 a little more 

00:05:25.040 --> 00:05:31.020
 [Music] 

00:05:28.020 --> 00:05:31.020
 i 

00:05:32.860 --> 00:05:39.700
 [Music] 

00:05:36.190 --> 00:05:45.380
 and we are missing the springboks 

00:05:39.700 --> 00:05:49.770
 [Music] 

00:05:45.380 --> 00:05:52.800
 and here we have our world the ready 

00:05:49.770 --> 00:05:57.030
 Now I'm very curious to see how 

00:05:52.800 --> 00:06:01.449
 is going to know access to be rich or not and 

00:05:57.030 --> 00:06:04.449
 let's take the first 

00:06:01.449 --> 00:06:04.449
 teaspoonful 

00:06:05.900 --> 00:06:10.879
 they want 

00:06:07.060 --> 00:06:10.879
 [Music] 

00:06:12.360 --> 00:06:22.139
 wow is super sweet 100 sugar the part 

00:06:19.379 --> 00:06:25.379
 On the side, it seems common 

00:06:22.139 --> 00:06:28.909
 frosting of a cake something like that 

00:06:25.379 --> 00:06:28.909
 chocolate is super rich 

00:06:30.750 --> 00:06:39.600
 how funny is super rich super super 

00:06:36.180 --> 00:06:40.920
 sweet but very good with having another 

00:06:39.600 --> 00:06:43.500
 big bite to see 

00:06:40.920 --> 00:06:46.010
 [Music] 

00:06:43.500 --> 00:06:46.010
