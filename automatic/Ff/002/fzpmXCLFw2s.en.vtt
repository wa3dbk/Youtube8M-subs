00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.299
 in 

00:00:14.849 --> 00:00:20.740
 the chiqui text welcome to the channel 

00:00:17.590 --> 00:00:23.260
 I hope they are excellent today 

00:00:20.740 --> 00:00:26.650
 this proposal the different from a 

00:00:23.260 --> 00:00:29.500
 makeup with lips 

00:00:26.650 --> 00:00:32.710
 intense but super intense in shades 

00:00:29.500 --> 00:00:35.740
 blue and purple is a super makeup 

00:00:32.710 --> 00:00:38.370
 Neutral that can be left to a labial 

00:00:35.740 --> 00:00:41.430
 purple rose 

00:00:38.370 --> 00:00:43.410
 green the color that you want I hope that 

00:00:41.430 --> 00:00:45.710
 like it and let's start with the 

00:00:43.410 --> 00:00:45.710
 tutorial 

00:00:45.770 --> 00:00:51.620
 I start with my first one by placing it in everything 

00:00:49.850 --> 00:00:54.380
 my father paid for dining in a lot of 

00:00:51.620 --> 00:00:56.390
 those shadows and then took a shadow 

00:00:54.380 --> 00:00:58.640
 the same tone of my skin and I'm going to 

00:00:56.390 --> 00:01:01.430
 apply from the mobile eyelid to 

00:00:58.640 --> 00:01:03.680
 below the eyebrow arch immediately 

00:01:01.430 --> 00:01:07.750
 by a broader brush to blur 

00:01:03.680 --> 00:01:11.240
 I'm going to have a single clear coffee for 

00:01:07.750 --> 00:01:14.090
 I'm going to blur that throughout 

00:01:11.240 --> 00:01:17.420
 of the basin but I'm going to stretch it towards 

00:01:14.090 --> 00:01:19.070
 the end and also towards the bridge of the 

00:01:17.420 --> 00:01:22.010
 nose 

00:01:19.070 --> 00:01:26.120
 with a super creamy black eyeliner 

00:01:22.010 --> 00:01:29.210
 I'm going to put a little bit at the end like 

00:01:26.120 --> 00:01:32.690
 concentrating for the most part and 

00:01:29.210 --> 00:01:36.590
 center a little bit but with a brush 

00:01:32.690 --> 00:01:39.680
 delgadito I will go forming the tail of 

00:01:36.590 --> 00:01:41.900
 lalita that we normally do in a 

00:01:39.680 --> 00:01:45.710
 outlined I want this outlined this 

00:01:41.900 --> 00:01:48.650
 intense since it accommodates and diffuses 

00:01:45.710 --> 00:01:50.960
 very well I'm going to seal it with the shadow 

00:01:48.650 --> 00:01:53.210
 black and with the same brush that is 

00:01:50.960 --> 00:01:55.780
 Super delgado and I will have more 

00:01:53.210 --> 00:01:55.780
 precision 

00:01:57.920 --> 00:02:03.710
 we intensify the look with a shadow 

00:02:01.250 --> 00:02:06.380
 dark coffee and placed it only in the 

00:02:03.710 --> 00:02:09.830
 external part of my eye I'll go 

00:02:06.380 --> 00:02:11.840
 applying little by little and doing the look 

00:02:09.830 --> 00:02:14.840
 as well as what half catches it with the 

00:02:11.840 --> 00:02:18.019
 feline look and see it lengthen 

00:02:14.840 --> 00:02:20.060
 milestone you know later I'm going to take 

00:02:18.019 --> 00:02:22.970
 the black shadow and I'll place it in the 

00:02:20.060 --> 00:02:26.150
 only part only 

00:02:22.970 --> 00:02:29.180
 end of the eye and blur it very 

00:02:26.150 --> 00:02:31.280
 slightly towards the tear but not 

00:02:29.180 --> 00:02:33.380
 came to the lacrimal whenever 

00:02:31.280 --> 00:02:36.250
 you add shadow you have to blur 

00:02:33.380 --> 00:02:39.890
 added the black and the blurred 

00:02:36.250 --> 00:02:42.770
 blurred with the brush that already had the 

00:02:39.890 --> 00:02:45.080
 coffee tone so that they were mixing 

00:02:42.770 --> 00:02:49.460
 the colors put my false eyelashes 

00:02:45.080 --> 00:02:51.650
 because I want the look to be intense 

00:02:49.460 --> 00:02:54.590
 but it does not mean that we're going to put 

00:02:51.650 --> 00:02:56.770
 to 300,000 colors only that 

00:02:54.590 --> 00:02:59.930
 see intense as to the dark 

00:02:56.770 --> 00:03:02.300
 also how I want something very intense in 

00:02:59.930 --> 00:03:04.670
 the eyes I'm going to put black eyeliner on 

00:03:02.300 --> 00:03:07.970
 the lower lashes and a little on the 

00:03:04.670 --> 00:03:10.160
 water line blurred the dark coffee and 

00:03:07.970 --> 00:03:13.070
 after congo 

00:03:10.160 --> 00:03:15.860
 I remove it from black and I blur it from 

00:03:13.070 --> 00:03:18.350
 black is not so much because we already have the 

00:03:15.860 --> 00:03:20.700
 super dark base only is to blur 

00:03:18.350 --> 00:03:23.760
 To make it look 

00:03:20.700 --> 00:03:26.940
 very well smoked that lower delineated 

00:03:23.760 --> 00:03:29.550
 I put on my layers of mascara and now if it stops 

00:03:26.940 --> 00:03:33.239
 that you notice more this makeup we are going to 

00:03:29.550 --> 00:03:35.129
 put the correctors put it in shape 

00:03:33.239 --> 00:03:37.680
 of triangle and blurred it with a 

00:03:35.129 --> 00:03:41.640
 brush with a stripe with a sponge 

00:03:37.680 --> 00:03:44.819
 wet so that the product does not 

00:03:41.640 --> 00:03:47.970
 be absorbed by the sponge but that 

00:03:44.819 --> 00:03:50.970
 it stays very well on my skin and that it 

00:03:47.970 --> 00:03:56.310
 diffuse or apply in a way 

00:03:50.970 --> 00:03:58.500
 very couple ok it blurred very well and 

00:03:56.310 --> 00:04:00.920
 then I'm going to seal it with the powder 

00:03:58.500 --> 00:04:00.920
 translucent 

00:04:04.520 --> 00:04:12.930
 with my bronzer I was doing the 

00:04:07.730 --> 00:04:14.640
 contour of my facial skin 

00:04:12.930 --> 00:04:17.310
 first check the areas that come 

00:04:14.640 --> 00:04:18.660
 being the cheekbones and you know my 

00:04:17.310 --> 00:04:21.660
 cheeks 

00:04:18.660 --> 00:04:25.490
 to suffer that they are that a bit in what 

00:04:21.660 --> 00:04:30.000
 that I understand the jaw and also this 

00:04:25.490 --> 00:04:32.640
 everything here so in front the chin to 

00:04:30.000 --> 00:04:35.940
 that looked a little more marked and what 

00:04:32.640 --> 00:04:38.040
 tell yourself first by applying it 

00:04:35.940 --> 00:04:40.680
 lines and then blur it with a 

00:04:38.040 --> 00:04:43.350
 broad brush I was blurring it in 

00:04:40.680 --> 00:04:45.500
 circles but keeping me in the same 

00:04:43.350 --> 00:04:45.500
 zone 

00:05:06.780 --> 00:05:12.360
 says a bit of the hat in the nose not 

00:05:09.930 --> 00:05:15.720
 so exaggerated the outline because neither 

00:05:12.360 --> 00:05:18.720
 we do not want to see ourselves so exaggerated but 

00:05:15.720 --> 00:05:21.750
 if a slight shadow and at the end use a 

00:05:18.720 --> 00:05:24.480
 pink tone on my cheeks to not 

00:05:21.750 --> 00:05:27.270
 see me so pale and chuli now yes we are going 

00:05:24.480 --> 00:05:29.550
 with how entertaining are the lipsticks 

00:05:27.270 --> 00:05:32.250
 or you can use the lipstick that you 

00:05:29.550 --> 00:05:35.340
 you want from a neutron from a rosita 

00:05:32.250 --> 00:05:37.889
 a black coffee but this time I 

00:05:35.340 --> 00:05:43.050
 I will use the most intense lipsticks 

00:05:37.889 --> 00:05:46.169
 have the blue the purple green pink and 

00:05:43.050 --> 00:05:49.460
 the black so leave me in a comment

00:05:59.009 --> 00:06:06.490
 but you can use but purple 

00:06:03.460 --> 00:06:09.220
 from another to a very intense one and 

00:06:06.490 --> 00:06:11.919
