00:00:13.970 --> 00:00:19.440
 crop rotation is based on 

00:00:17.310 --> 00:00:21.930
 assumption that the insistence of 

00:00:19.440 --> 00:00:24.360
 same type of plant on the ground a 

00:00:21.930 --> 00:00:27.240
 in the long run it runs out of possibilities 

00:00:24.360 --> 00:00:30.090
 nutrients that must therefore be replenished 

00:00:27.240 --> 00:00:32.869
 cultivating there later crops of 

00:00:30.090 --> 00:00:32.869
 different type 

00:00:33.060 --> 00:00:37.980
 vegetables are divided into forts 

00:00:35.220 --> 00:00:40.690
 consumers of fertilizer as the cabbage 

00:00:37.980 --> 00:00:43.960
 potatoes and courgettes 

00:00:40.690 --> 00:00:47.199
 fagots, like beetroots 

00:00:43.960 --> 00:00:51.250
 lettuces and beans as weak as beans 

00:00:47.199 --> 00:00:53.949
 legumes as of this subdivision 

00:00:51.250 --> 00:00:56.500
 flowerbeds will be organized in three 

00:00:53.949 --> 00:01:01.180
 areas reserved respectively a 

00:00:56.500 --> 00:01:03.190
 medium and weak strong consumers every 

00:01:01.180 --> 00:01:05.950
 year the crops will be moved by a 

00:01:03.190 --> 00:01:09.899
 sector to not tire the earth up 

00:01:05.950 --> 00:01:09.899
 to complete the tour in four years 

00:01:17.750 --> 00:01:22.790
 the earth can recover its own 

00:01:20.390 --> 00:01:25.730
 nutritional values ​​that are reintegrated 

00:01:22.790 --> 00:01:30.220
 thanks also the production of nitrogen from 

00:01:25.730 --> 00:01:30.220
 part of plants with weak consumption 

00:01:43.070 --> 00:01:47.360
 in addition to the temporal rotation one can 

00:01:45.470 --> 00:01:49.850
 also implement the intercropping 

00:01:47.360 --> 00:01:52.460
 that is, planting in the same 

00:01:49.850 --> 00:01:54.380
 complementary plant spaces 

00:01:52.460 --> 00:01:57.610
 regarding maturation times e 

00:01:54.380 --> 00:01:57.610
 nutritional characteristics
