00:00:25.410 --> 00:00:34.370 
and you don't need much create a little
little<00:00:26.160> terrain<00:00:26.699> look<00:00:27.210> at<00:00:27.330> this

00:00:34.370 --> 00:00:34.380 

00:00:34.380 --> 00:00:36.860 

using<00:00:35.310> the<00:00:35.460> same<00:00:35.820> background<00:00:36.480> the<00:00:36.660> same

00:00:36.860 --> 00:00:36.870 
using the same background the same

00:00:36.870 --> 00:00:43.640 
using the same background the same
negative<00:00:37.230> space<00:00:37.500> that<00:00:37.680> we<00:00:37.800> have<00:00:40.100> see<00:00:41.100> that<00:00:42.650> and

00:00:43.640 --> 00:00:43.650 
negative space that we have see that and

00:00:43.650 --> 00:00:46.490 
negative space that we have see that and
just<00:00:43.860> blending<00:00:44.400> in<00:00:44.400> some<00:00:45.270> of<00:00:45.420> these<00:00:45.510> darker

just blending in some of these darker
color<00:00:46.800> some<00:00:47.100> of<00:00:47.220> these<00:00:47.310> rocks<00:00:47.730> that<00:00:48.090> look<00:00:48.300> at

00:00:48.770 --> 00:00:48.780 
color some of these rocks that look at

00:00:48.780 --> 00:00:52.810 
color some of these rocks that look at
that<00:00:48.900> now<00:00:49.800> imagine<00:00:50.070> a<00:00:50.370> tree<00:00:50.640> right<00:00:51.000> about<00:00:51.330> here

00:00:52.810 --> 00:00:52.820 
that now imagine a tree right about here

00:00:52.820 --> 00:00:58.880 
that now imagine a tree right about here
okay<00:00:56.030> so<00:00:57.030> this<00:00:57.420> is<00:00:57.600> a<00:00:57.630> really<00:00:57.960> quick<00:00:58.350> and<00:00:58.560> easy

00:02:51.320 --> 00:02:51.330 
you're creating here are giving you a

00:02:51.330 --> 00:02:55.970 
you're creating here are giving you a
better<00:02:51.780> effect<00:02:54.500> look<00:02:55.500> at<00:02:55.590> that<00:02:55.709> you<00:02:55.860> can

00:02:55.970 --> 00:02:55.980 
better effect look at that you can

00:02:55.980 --> 00:02:58.100 
better effect look at that you can
create<00:02:56.190> all<00:02:56.459> sorts<00:02:56.489> of<00:02:56.819> cool<00:02:57.000> little<00:02:57.239> looking

00:02:58.100 --> 00:02:58.110 
create all sorts of cool little looking

00:02:58.110 --> 00:03:03.260 
create all sorts of cool little looking
to<00:02:58.319> reigns

00:03:03.260 --> 00:03:03.270 

00:03:03.270 --> 00:03:05.090 

and<00:03:03.900> you<00:03:03.990> can<00:03:04.170> learn<00:03:04.320> to<00:03:04.500> manipulate<00:03:04.590> the

00:03:05.090 --> 00:03:05.100 
and you can learn to manipulate the

00:03:05.100 --> 00:03:13.360 
and you can learn to manipulate the
paint<00:03:05.310> in<00:03:05.490> this<00:03:05.700> manner

00:03:13.360 --> 00:03:13.370 

00:03:13.370 --> 00:03:17.920 

that<00:03:14.200> we<00:03:15.200> could<00:03:15.409> GUI<00:03:15.620> yes<00:03:16.720> and<00:03:17.720> you<00:03:17.780> can

00:03:17.920 --> 00:03:17.930 
that we could GUI yes and you can

00:03:17.930 --> 00:03:19.410 
that we could GUI yes and you can
actually<00:03:18.110> do<00:03:18.440> this<00:03:18.500> a<00:03:18.650> little<00:03:18.860> more<00:03:19.010> realistic

00:03:19.410 --> 00:03:19.420 
actually do this a little more realistic

00:03:19.420 --> 00:03:21.580 
actually do this a little more realistic
but<00:03:20.420> this<00:03:20.569> is<00:03:20.690> a<00:03:20.720> little<00:03:20.959> technique<00:03:21.319> that<00:03:21.530> you

00:03:21.580 --> 00:03:21.590 
but this is a little technique that you

00:03:21.590 --> 00:03:23.140 
but this is a little technique that you
guys<00:03:21.709> can<00:03:21.890> actually<00:03:22.220> do<00:03:22.430> well<00:03:22.670> spray<00:03:22.909> painting

00:03:23.140 --> 00:03:23.150 
guys can actually do well spray painting

00:03:23.150 --> 00:03:25.899 
guys can actually do well spray painting
life<00:03:23.540> and<00:03:23.930> not<00:03:24.019> just<00:03:24.290> to<00:03:24.470> to<00:03:25.069> give<00:03:25.280> the<00:03:25.549> aliens

00:03:25.899 --> 00:03:25.909 
life and not just to to give the aliens

00:03:25.909 --> 00:03:29.830 
life and not just to to give the aliens
to<00:03:26.060> keep<00:03:26.209> them<00:03:26.360> captivated<00:03:27.019> to<00:03:28.540> to<00:03:29.540> keep<00:03:29.690> them

00:03:29.830 --> 00:03:29.840 
to keep them captivated to to keep them

00:03:29.840 --> 00:03:35.800 
to keep them captivated to to keep them
entertained<00:03:33.280> and<00:03:34.280> you<00:03:34.670> can<00:03:34.790> actually<00:03:34.940> use

00:03:35.800 --> 00:03:35.810 
entertained and you can actually use

00:03:35.810 --> 00:03:37.990 
entertained and you can actually use
that<00:03:35.840> to<00:03:36.200> practice<00:03:36.739> yourself<00:03:37.190> now<00:03:37.730> way<00:03:37.940> you

00:03:37.990 --> 00:03:38.000 
that to practice yourself now way you

00:03:38.000 --> 00:03:40.080 
that to practice yourself now way you
start<00:03:38.599> learning<00:03:38.750> to<00:03:38.930> manipulate<00:03:39.110> the<00:03:39.590> paint

00:03:40.080 --> 00:03:40.090 
start learning to manipulate the paint

00:03:40.090 --> 00:03:48.530 
start learning to manipulate the paint
creating<00:03:41.090> better<00:03:41.269> effects

00:03:48.530 --> 00:03:48.540 

00:03:48.540 --> 00:03:53.070 

you're<00:03:49.540> that<00:03:49.660> little<00:03:50.410> bit<00:03:51.100> black<00:03:51.370> here<00:03:52.080> you

00:03:53.070 --> 00:03:53.080 
you're that little bit black here you

00:03:53.080 --> 00:03:56.520 
you're that little bit black here you
paid<00:03:53.440> it<00:03:53.620> in<00:03:54.240> so<00:03:55.240> practice<00:03:55.720> with<00:03:56.140> these<00:03:56.290> guys

00:03:56.520 --> 00:03:56.530 
paid it in so practice with these guys

00:03:56.530 --> 00:03:58.940 
paid it in so practice with these guys
you<00:03:56.950> know<00:03:57.070> it's<00:03:57.250> definitely<00:03:57.760> a<00:03:57.790> cool<00:03:58.060> little

00:03:58.940 --> 00:03:58.950 
you know it's definitely a cool little

00:03:58.950 --> 00:04:01.080 
you know it's definitely a cool little
technique<00:03:59.950> that<00:04:00.220> you<00:04:00.310> can<00:04:00.490> use<00:04:00.640> just<00:04:00.970> to

00:04:01.080 --> 00:04:01.090 
technique that you can use just to

00:04:01.090 --> 00:04:05.640 
technique that you can use just to
practice<00:04:03.360> create<00:04:04.360> terrains<00:04:04.780> create

00:04:05.640 --> 00:04:05.650 
practice create terrains create

00:04:05.650 --> 00:04:07.380 
practice create terrains create
something<00:04:05.860> like<00:04:06.010> that<00:04:06.220> little<00:04:06.640> skull<00:04:07.060> there

00:04:07.380 --> 00:04:07.390 
something like that little skull there

00:04:07.390 --> 00:04:09.540 
something like that little skull there
now<00:04:08.080> of<00:04:08.230> course<00:04:08.290> you<00:04:08.590> could<00:04:08.740> have<00:04:08.830> added<00:04:09.250> more

00:04:09.540 --> 00:04:09.550 
now of course you could have added more

00:04:09.550 --> 00:04:11.340 
now of course you could have added more
detail<00:04:10.000> to<00:04:10.180> this<00:04:10.330> to<00:04:10.480> make<00:04:10.600> it<00:04:10.630> more<00:04:11.140> realistic

00:04:11.340 --> 00:04:11.350 
detail to this to make it more realistic

00:04:11.350 --> 00:04:14.700 
detail to this to make it more realistic
and<00:04:12.570> when<00:04:13.570> you<00:04:13.690> learn<00:04:13.870> to<00:04:13.900> manipulate<00:04:14.140> your

00:04:14.700 --> 00:04:14.710 
and when you learn to manipulate your

00:04:14.710 --> 00:04:17.460 
and when you learn to manipulate your
paints<00:04:15.100> better<00:04:15.280> you'll<00:04:15.520> know<00:04:15.870> how<00:04:16.870> much<00:04:17.140> you

00:04:17.460 --> 00:04:17.470 
paints better you'll know how much you

00:04:17.470 --> 00:04:20.610 
paints better you'll know how much you
can<00:04:17.620> go<00:04:17.859> with<00:04:18.400> with<00:04:18.910> just<00:04:19.180> a<00:04:19.330> quick<00:04:19.750> devil<00:04:20.170> see

00:04:20.610 --> 00:04:20.620 
can go with with just a quick devil see

00:04:20.620 --> 00:04:22.680 
can go with with just a quick devil see
with<00:04:20.830> color<00:04:21.100> place<00:04:21.430> I<00:04:21.609> can't<00:04:21.850> go<00:04:22.000> very<00:04:22.030> far<00:04:22.480> I

00:04:22.680 --> 00:04:22.690 
with color place I can't go very far I

00:04:22.690 --> 00:04:25.680 
with color place I can't go very far I
noticed<00:04:23.050> that<00:04:23.110> it<00:04:23.290> drives<00:04:23.560> rather<00:04:23.950> quickly<00:04:24.690> I

00:04:25.680 --> 00:04:25.690 
noticed that it drives rather quickly I

00:04:25.690 --> 00:04:27.510 
noticed that it drives rather quickly I
mean<00:04:26.200> with<00:04:26.380> color<00:04:26.590> police<00:04:26.860> with<00:04:27.070> rustoleum

00:04:27.510 --> 00:04:27.520 
mean with color police with rustoleum

00:04:27.520 --> 00:04:29.760 
mean with color police with rustoleum
with<00:04:28.120> color<00:04:28.480> place<00:04:28.810> I<00:04:29.020> could<00:04:29.110> actually<00:04:29.380> go<00:04:29.740> a

00:04:29.760 --> 00:04:29.770 
with color place I could actually go a

00:04:29.770 --> 00:04:33.030 
with color place I could actually go a
little<00:04:30.100> bit<00:04:30.340> further<00:04:30.580> and<00:04:30.990> I<00:04:31.990> know<00:04:32.050> how<00:04:32.650> much<00:04:32.860> I

00:04:33.030 --> 00:04:33.040 
little bit further and I know how much I

00:04:33.040 --> 00:04:35.100 
little bit further and I know how much I
could<00:04:33.280> actually<00:04:33.880> sit<00:04:34.330> here<00:04:34.510> and<00:04:34.570> manipulate

00:04:35.100 --> 00:04:35.110 
could actually sit here and manipulate

00:04:35.110 --> 00:04:39.690 
could actually sit here and manipulate
the<00:04:35.260> paint<00:04:35.530> you<00:04:36.010> know<00:04:36.130> and<00:04:36.250> keep<00:04:36.400> going<00:04:37.830> so<00:04:38.830> not

00:04:39.690 --> 00:04:39.700 
the paint you know and keep going so not

00:04:39.700 --> 00:04:46.490 
the paint you know and keep going so not
for<00:04:40.240> you<00:04:40.330> guys<00:04:40.510> to<00:04:40.690> experiment<00:04:41.320> with<00:04:41.970> practice

00:04:46.490 --> 00:04:46.500 

00:04:46.500 --> 00:04:50.760 

yeah<00:04:47.500> do<00:04:47.920> that<00:04:47.950> and<00:04:48.570> in<00:04:49.570> this<00:04:50.170> manner<00:04:50.500> you'll

00:04:50.760 --> 00:04:50.770 
yeah do that and in this manner you'll

00:04:50.770 --> 00:04:54.300 
yeah do that and in this manner you'll
learn<00:04:50.920> to<00:04:51.390> to<00:04:52.390> know<00:04:52.630> how<00:04:53.290> much<00:04:53.530> paint<00:04:53.890> like<00:04:54.220> I

00:04:54.300 --> 00:04:54.310 
learn to to know how much paint like I

00:04:54.310 --> 00:04:55.800 
learn to to know how much paint like I
said<00:04:54.370> how<00:04:54.610> much<00:04:54.760> pain<00:04:55.000> you<00:04:55.150> can<00:04:55.300> that<00:04:55.570> you<00:04:55.600> can

00:04:55.800 --> 00:04:55.810 
said how much pain you can that you can

00:04:55.810 --> 00:04:59.070 
said how much pain you can that you can
use<00:04:55.990> on<00:04:56.140> just<00:04:56.350> a<00:04:56.440> single<00:04:56.620> tap<00:04:57.870> how<00:04:58.870> much

00:04:59.070 --> 00:04:59.080 
use on just a single tap how much

00:04:59.080 --> 00:05:03.000 
use on just a single tap how much
shadowing<00:04:59.590> you<00:04:59.710> can<00:04:59.950> get<00:05:00.130> out<00:05:00.340> of<00:05:00.370> it<00:05:02.010> what

00:05:03.000 --> 00:05:03.010 
shadowing you can get out of it what

00:05:03.010 --> 00:05:05.159 
shadowing you can get out of it what
sorts<00:05:03.280> of<00:05:03.340> neat<00:05:03.520> little<00:05:03.700> little<00:05:04.510> stuff<00:05:04.780> but
