00:00:00.269 --> 00:00:03.290 

okay<00:00:00.719> this<00:00:00.900> is<00:00:01.050> my<00:00:01.199> new<00:00:01.230> sending<00:00:01.829> unit<00:00:02.159> and<00:00:02.730> I'm

00:00:03.290 --> 00:00:03.300 
okay this is my new sending unit and I'm

00:00:03.300 --> 00:00:06.920 
okay this is my new sending unit and I'm
testing<00:00:03.780> it<00:00:04.170> before<00:00:04.620> I<00:00:04.910> got<00:00:05.910> the<00:00:06.089> tank<00:00:06.390> and

00:00:06.920 --> 00:00:06.930 
testing it before I got the tank and

00:00:06.930 --> 00:00:09.919 
testing it before I got the tank and
what<00:00:07.410> I've<00:00:07.529> done<00:00:07.770> is<00:00:08.150> it's<00:00:09.150> in<00:00:09.360> the<00:00:09.450> position

00:00:09.919 --> 00:00:09.929 
what I've done is it's in the position

00:00:09.929 --> 00:00:11.629 
what I've done is it's in the position
right<00:00:10.170> now<00:00:10.410> that<00:00:10.679> it<00:00:10.800> would<00:00:10.950> be<00:00:11.130> if<00:00:11.340> the<00:00:11.460> gas

00:00:11.629 --> 00:00:11.639 
right now that it would be if the gas

00:00:11.639 --> 00:00:14.120 
right now that it would be if the gas
tank<00:00:12.030> were<00:00:12.179> empty<00:00:12.590> gonna<00:00:13.590> be<00:00:13.710> all<00:00:13.860> the<00:00:14.009> way

00:00:14.120 --> 00:00:14.130 
tank were empty gonna be all the way

00:00:14.130 --> 00:00:17.300 
tank were empty gonna be all the way
down<00:00:14.160> and<00:00:14.969> I<00:00:15.480> got<00:00:16.320> it<00:00:16.470> hooked<00:00:16.560> to<00:00:16.710> the<00:00:16.800> car<00:00:17.070> I

00:00:17.300 --> 00:00:17.310 
down and I got it hooked to the car I

00:00:17.310 --> 00:00:19.849 
down and I got it hooked to the car I
got<00:00:17.550> the<00:00:17.609> switch<00:00:17.940> turned<00:00:18.300> on<00:00:18.710> and<00:00:19.710> you'll

00:00:19.849 --> 00:00:19.859 
got the switch turned on and you'll

00:00:19.859 --> 00:00:21.710 
got the switch turned on and you'll
notice<00:00:20.160> my<00:00:20.310> gas<00:00:20.520> gauge<00:00:20.820> is<00:00:21.029> in<00:00:21.060> the<00:00:21.300> empty

00:00:21.710 --> 00:00:21.720 
notice my gas gauge is in the empty

00:00:21.720 --> 00:00:26.830 
notice my gas gauge is in the empty
position<00:00:22.560> think<00:00:23.490> you<00:00:23.609> can<00:00:23.789> see<00:00:23.970> that<00:00:24.619> so<00:00:25.619> if<00:00:26.369> I

00:00:26.830 --> 00:00:26.840 
position think you can see that so if I

00:00:26.840 --> 00:00:31.250 
position think you can see that so if I
go<00:00:27.840> over<00:00:27.869> here<00:00:28.109> and<00:00:28.970> move<00:00:29.970> the<00:00:30.689> sending<00:00:31.199> unit

00:00:31.250 --> 00:00:31.260 
go over here and move the sending unit

00:00:31.260 --> 00:00:34.549 
go over here and move the sending unit
arm<00:00:32.390> basically<00:00:33.390> this<00:00:33.750> would<00:00:33.930> be<00:00:34.079> the<00:00:34.200> top<00:00:34.410> of

00:00:34.549 --> 00:00:34.559 
arm basically this would be the top of

00:00:34.559 --> 00:00:36.709 
arm basically this would be the top of
the<00:00:34.620> tank<00:00:34.829> so<00:00:35.130> this<00:00:35.280> would<00:00:35.430> be<00:00:35.579> with<00:00:36.360> the<00:00:36.540> arm

00:00:36.709 --> 00:00:36.719 
the tank so this would be with the arm

00:00:36.719 --> 00:00:42.040 
the tank so this would be with the arm
all<00:00:37.020> the<00:00:37.260> way<00:00:37.410> up<00:00:37.559> and<00:00:38.070> almost<00:00:38.430> all<00:00:38.640> the<00:00:38.670> way<00:00:38.910> up

00:00:42.040 --> 00:00:42.050 

00:00:42.050 --> 00:00:50.920 

gauge<00:00:43.050> should<00:00:43.379> move<00:00:46.129> and<00:00:47.840> it<00:00:48.840> is<00:00:49.039> moving<00:00:50.039> but

00:00:50.920 --> 00:00:50.930 
gauge should move and it is moving but

00:00:50.930 --> 00:00:56.029 
gauge should move and it is moving but
can<00:00:51.930> you<00:00:52.050> see<00:00:52.230> it<00:00:52.320> move<00:00:54.469> so<00:00:55.469> that<00:00:55.590> tells<00:00:55.829> me

00:00:56.029 --> 00:00:56.039 
can you see it move so that tells me

00:00:56.039 --> 00:00:57.860 
can you see it move so that tells me
that<00:00:56.070> it<00:00:56.340> the<00:00:56.610> fuel<00:00:56.850> gauge<00:00:57.030> this<00:00:57.420> fuel<00:00:57.690> gauge

00:00:57.860 --> 00:00:57.870 
that it the fuel gauge this fuel gauge

00:00:57.870 --> 00:00:59.479 
that it the fuel gauge this fuel gauge
works<00:00:58.170> and<00:00:58.469> with<00:00:58.559> that<00:00:58.680> sending<00:00:59.070> unit<00:00:59.340> that's

00:00:59.479 --> 00:00:59.489 
works and with that sending unit that's

00:00:59.489 --> 00:01:00.979 
works and with that sending unit that's
going<00:00:59.789> to<00:00:59.910> work<00:01:00.000> which<00:01:00.329> is<00:01:00.449> gonna<00:01:00.570> be<00:01:00.660> good

00:01:00.979 --> 00:01:00.989 
going to work which is gonna be good

00:01:00.989 --> 00:01:03.260 
going to work which is gonna be good
because<00:01:01.140> I<00:01:01.320> think<00:01:01.559> if<00:01:02.430> you<00:01:02.579> got<00:01:02.699> drive<00:01:02.969> car

00:01:03.260 --> 00:01:03.270 
because I think if you got drive car

00:01:03.270 --> 00:01:05.479 
because I think if you got drive car
much<00:01:03.510> knowing<00:01:04.470> how<00:01:04.559> much<00:01:04.769> fuel<00:01:05.129> you<00:01:05.159> have

00:01:05.479 --> 00:01:05.489 
much knowing how much fuel you have

00:01:05.489 --> 00:01:09.260 
much knowing how much fuel you have
that's<00:01:05.820> kind<00:01:06.060> of<00:01:06.090> important<00:01:06.570> so<00:01:08.119> with<00:01:09.119> that

00:01:09.260 --> 00:01:09.270 
that's kind of important so with that

00:01:09.270 --> 00:01:11.000 
that's kind of important so with that
little<00:01:09.420> experimental<00:01:10.170> success

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:11.010 
little experimental success

00:01:11.010 --> 00:01:14.450 
little experimental success
I<00:01:11.040> will<00:01:12.260> unhook<00:01:13.260> that<00:01:13.320> sending<00:01:13.920> unit<00:01:14.189> put<00:01:14.369> it

00:01:14.450 --> 00:01:14.460 
I will unhook that sending unit put it

00:01:14.460 --> 00:01:15.950 
I will unhook that sending unit put it
back<00:01:14.610> in<00:01:14.760> the<00:01:14.820> box<00:01:15.030> put<00:01:15.390> it<00:01:15.479> safely<00:01:15.840> in<00:01:15.900> the

00:01:15.950 --> 00:01:15.960 
back in the box put it safely in the

00:01:15.960 --> 00:01:17.840 
back in the box put it safely in the
back<00:01:16.140> seat<00:01:16.439> go<00:01:16.680> ahead<00:01:16.890> and<00:01:17.009> drop<00:01:17.280> my<00:01:17.549> tank

00:01:17.840 --> 00:01:17.850 
back seat go ahead and drop my tank

00:01:17.850 --> 00:01:20.300 
back seat go ahead and drop my tank

this<00:01:22.650> gas<00:01:22.920> tank<00:01:23.250> put<00:01:23.520> the<00:01:23.610> new<00:01:23.759> one<00:01:23.909> back<00:01:23.939> in

00:01:24.580 --> 00:01:24.590 
this gas tank put the new one back in

00:01:24.590 --> 00:01:28.780 
this gas tank put the new one back in
and<00:01:25.590> we'll<00:01:25.710> go<00:01:25.830> from<00:01:25.950> there

00:01:28.780 --> 00:01:28.790 

00:01:28.790 --> 00:01:31.399 

by<00:01:29.790> the<00:01:29.850> way<00:01:30.000> this<00:01:30.180> is<00:01:30.390> the<00:01:30.540> only<00:01:30.840> gas<00:01:31.049> tank

00:01:31.399 --> 00:01:31.409 
by the way this is the only gas tank

00:01:31.409 --> 00:01:33.679 
by the way this is the only gas tank
that<00:01:31.500> fits<00:01:31.799> this<00:01:32.070> car<00:01:32.400> I<00:01:32.909> had<00:01:33.329> a<00:01:33.360> few<00:01:33.540> people

00:01:33.679 --> 00:01:33.689 
that fits this car I had a few people

00:01:33.689 --> 00:01:35.330 
that fits this car I had a few people
say<00:01:33.840> well<00:01:34.140> just<00:01:34.320> get<00:01:34.500> a<00:01:34.530> new<00:01:34.650> gas<00:01:34.890> tank

00:01:35.330 --> 00:01:35.340 
say well just get a new gas tank

00:01:35.340 --> 00:01:37.490 
say well just get a new gas tank
they<00:01:36.060> make<00:01:36.240> gas<00:01:36.450> tanks<00:01:36.810> for<00:01:36.900> the<00:01:36.960> crown<00:01:37.200> vics

00:01:37.490 --> 00:01:37.500 
they make gas tanks for the crown vics

00:01:37.500 --> 00:01:40.010 
they make gas tanks for the crown vics
and<00:01:37.890> for<00:01:38.130> the<00:01:38.189> regular<00:01:38.340> hoards<00:01:38.939> and<00:01:39.689> they<00:01:39.840> have

00:01:40.010 --> 00:01:40.020 
and for the regular hoards and they have

00:01:40.020 --> 00:01:42.440 
and for the regular hoards and they have
straps<00:01:40.470> that<00:01:40.710> go<00:01:40.770> under<00:01:41.159> them<00:01:41.250> and<00:01:41.460> there<00:01:41.790> they

00:01:42.440 --> 00:01:42.450 
straps that go under them and there they

00:01:42.450 --> 00:01:43.910 
straps that go under them and there they
fill<00:01:42.750> from<00:01:43.079> the<00:01:43.200> back<00:01:43.380> and<00:01:43.649> they<00:01:43.740> have<00:01:43.890> a

00:01:43.910 --> 00:01:43.920 
fill from the back and they have a

00:01:43.920 --> 00:01:45.550 
fill from the back and they have a
little<00:01:44.130> clip<00:01:44.310> down<00:01:44.549> tacked

00:01:45.550 --> 00:01:45.560 
little clip down tacked

00:01:45.560 --> 00:01:47.500 
little clip down tacked
this<00:01:46.040> one<00:01:46.220> feels<00:01:46.430> from<00:01:46.670> the<00:01:46.730> side<00:01:47.000> because<00:01:47.300> of

00:01:47.500 --> 00:01:47.510 
this one feels from the side because of

00:01:47.510 --> 00:01:50.260 
this one feels from the side because of
the<00:01:48.050> way<00:01:48.140> this<00:01:48.320> gate<00:01:48.560> comes<00:01:48.860> down<00:01:49.100> it<00:01:49.280> flip<00:01:50.090> the

00:01:50.260 --> 00:01:50.270 
the way this gate comes down it flip the

00:01:50.270 --> 00:01:53.110 
the way this gate comes down it flip the
tag<00:01:50.540> back<00:01:50.900> and<00:01:51.350> it<00:01:51.440> comes<00:01:51.650> down<00:01:51.890> I<00:01:52.160> guess<00:01:52.970> they

00:01:53.110 --> 00:01:53.120 
tag back and it comes down I guess they

00:01:53.120 --> 00:01:56.020 
tag back and it comes down I guess they
put<00:01:53.300> it<00:01:53.390> up<00:01:53.480> to<00:01:53.750> the<00:01:53.780> side<00:01:54.080> anyway<00:01:55.000> but<00:01:56.000> uh

00:01:56.020 --> 00:01:56.030 
put it up to the side anyway but uh

00:01:56.030 --> 00:01:58.930 
put it up to the side anyway but uh
because<00:01:56.900> of<00:01:57.050> that<00:01:57.520> it's<00:01:58.520> just<00:01:58.730> a<00:01:58.790> whole

00:01:58.930 --> 00:01:58.940 
because of that it's just a whole

00:01:58.940 --> 00:02:00.310 
because of that it's just a whole
different<00:01:59.300> gas<00:01:59.450> tank<00:01:59.780> and<00:01:59.990> I<00:02:00.020> haven't<00:02:00.230> found

00:02:00.310 --> 00:02:00.320 
different gas tank and I haven't found
