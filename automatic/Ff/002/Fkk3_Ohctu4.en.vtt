00:00:02.260 --> 00:00:04.720
 two 

00:00:04.720 --> 00:00:08.630
 For all that, Mexico needs a second installment, the term analysis and 

00:00:08.630 --> 00:00:11.879
 we are going to analyze the bug in 1979 

00:00:11.879 --> 00:00:13.879
 the map bumped into 

00:00:13.879 --> 00:00:18.189
 per cent is a flight game death by equipment dyes machetes map 

00:00:18.189 --> 00:00:21.359
 i as always understand machaín 12 points after 

00:00:21.909 --> 00:00:25.489
 be up that's where michael ti's enemies are going to be this point of 

00:00:25.489 --> 00:00:28.060
 down which is where the division and its companions 

00:00:28.060 --> 00:00:31.369
 now the strategy to use said in this first game is a strategy 

00:00:31.369 --> 00:00:32.550
 pretty simple 

00:00:32.550 --> 00:00:35.819
 the pastor patrolling this corridor on the right 

00:00:35.819 --> 00:00:37.329
 and up where they are 

00:00:37.329 --> 00:00:40.060
 the percent and the big bunker 

00:00:40.060 --> 00:00:43.770
 I was going to continue to patrol all this sector here that would be like a 

00:00:43.770 --> 00:00:44.750
 quadrant 

00:00:44.750 --> 00:00:48.670
 for orchestras of exclusion to goods because richar is going to force that 

00:00:48.670 --> 00:00:51.129
 all the companions every time he dies 

00:00:51.129 --> 00:00:53.639
 return to be exposed in the place where he is 

00:00:53.639 --> 00:00:57.400
 which means that the cava stumble with a credit for this issue 

00:00:57.400 --> 00:01:01.640
 now there are three qualities that we are going to rescue from the oblivion of the record 

00:01:01.640 --> 00:01:05.440
 but you know how excellently how to stay alive number 2 is very 

00:01:05.440 --> 00:01:06.220
 patient 

00:01:06.220 --> 00:01:09.540
 ignored 3 has to exacting marksmanship 

00:01:09.540 --> 00:01:13.380
 then we come to the game itself so it prevents us from seeing exactly what 

00:01:13.380 --> 00:01:14.680
 what I mean 

00:01:14.680 --> 00:01:18.840
 however I told him before the tricolor on the right is the main strategy 

00:01:18.840 --> 00:01:19.860
 prison 

00:01:19.860 --> 00:01:23.360
 percent and several things and as I told you before you start you know a lot 

00:01:23.360 --> 00:01:24.560
 stay alive 

00:01:24.560 --> 00:01:27.909
 percent before you guys go to see I do not know how many times they hurt you 

00:01:27.909 --> 00:01:29.570
 richart and do not kill him 

00:01:29.570 --> 00:01:31.810
 that is something like 

00:01:31.810 --> 00:01:33.240
 tourists respect 

00:01:33.240 --> 00:01:34.800
 its the first time 

00:01:34.800 --> 00:01:39.160
 was going to happen but constantly during all this video arrechea he was shot 

00:01:39.160 --> 00:01:42.350
 they hurt him and yet he always gets out 

00:01:42.350 --> 00:01:45.160
 for the reasons why this step is because this 

00:01:45.160 --> 00:01:47.670
 per cent the richter game mode 

00:01:47.670 --> 00:01:50.680
 is he as I said before he is very cautious 

00:01:50.680 --> 00:01:54.860
 Per hundred richard is patient and that is something that is important to know how 

00:01:54.860 --> 00:01:58.510
 bad how to play well this game a lot of people including myself 

00:01:59.440 --> 00:02:02.980
 and we rush to try to take out the kioskers properly 

00:02:02.980 --> 00:02:05.270
 and what happens when you do not rush when what starts to flop 

00:02:05.270 --> 00:02:06.890
 very much is that 

00:02:06.890 --> 00:02:11.150
 one tends to die more times because you do not take care of yourself so much you do not come 

00:02:11.150 --> 00:02:16.179
 the impact is not faster less dyn in the corners and so on 

00:02:16.179 --> 00:02:19.189
 then another thing to also mention that what we go to bed 

00:02:19.189 --> 00:02:20.689
 esti 

00:02:20.689 --> 00:02:24.179
 the most like Richard use secondary weapons in this game 

00:02:24.179 --> 00:02:27.189
 i the way he uses the really nonexistent 

00:02:27.189 --> 00:02:29.569
 if you have a principle when you just left 

00:02:29.569 --> 00:02:32.109
 the partner who is used to the right side of the 

00:02:32.109 --> 00:02:35.590
 July already in these games can not allow people to buy since 

00:02:35.589 --> 00:02:36.159
 have 

00:02:36.159 --> 00:02:38.160
 and once again they hurt you and over 

00:02:38.160 --> 00:02:40.959
 this practice is like magic 

00:02:40.959 --> 00:02:44.439
 the one of him always you or having changed secondary form for a 

00:02:44.439 --> 00:02:45.620
 bet on bad weather 

00:02:45.620 --> 00:02:47.620
 then if you realize 

00:02:47.620 --> 00:02:51.319
 in the days of imprisonment and almost never 5 the truth that what he assures him 

00:02:51.319 --> 00:02:52.899
 has seen at least in black ops 

00:02:52.899 --> 00:02:55.589
 use scavenger or stable 

00:02:55.589 --> 00:02:56.439
 why 

00:02:56.439 --> 00:02:59.789
 always seems to have weapons always has ammunition 

00:02:59.789 --> 00:03:04.389
 if you can see camps that the jokes that the pilots hope you do not 

00:03:04.389 --> 00:03:06.569
 we are always skeleton that nissan are 

00:03:06.569 --> 00:03:09.040
 in blue jorge henn percent 

00:03:09.040 --> 00:03:12.479
 in a table and to be able to take them out if you give yourself one less 

00:03:12.479 --> 00:03:14.469
 in yellow these are the damages be 

00:03:14.469 --> 00:03:17.769
 i the indec percent but you are using in English 

00:03:17.769 --> 00:03:20.010
 he does not tell you very effectively because 

00:03:20.010 --> 00:03:24.210
 really because of the pp strategy what is having 

00:03:24.210 --> 00:03:25.560
 protecting this sector 

00:03:25.560 --> 00:03:28.850
 there is really no need to have for example pirate acr 

00:03:28.850 --> 00:03:33.590
 because none of the seven bayern enemies never ap with that of a phlegmon in 

00:03:33.590 --> 00:03:34.949
 their way 

00:03:34.949 --> 00:03:38.309
 but once again to richard operators east 

00:03:38.309 --> 00:03:41.729
 Although there is something here that seems to me to be very interesting to analyze 

00:03:41.729 --> 00:03:46.409
 the payment of said contest that has in práxedis g in 4 9 god 

00:03:48.499 --> 00:03:50.389
 already 7 8 and 10 

00:03:50.389 --> 00:03:53.389
 percent do not use any until they have removed all three 

00:03:55.039 --> 00:03:58.309
 once again here I am teaching you how patience really happened 

00:03:59.469 --> 00:04:02.579
 at the moment he gets the mandatory dogs at one time 

00:04:02.579 --> 00:04:05.890
 Now this is the only part of the day, you are going to see that you get out of 

00:04:05.889 --> 00:04:08.919
 Let's call in your comfort zone 

00:04:08.919 --> 00:04:09.920
 and is that he 

00:04:09.920 --> 00:04:11.559
 the quadrant that was patrolling 

00:04:11.559 --> 00:04:15.719
 the reason is because in this downtown building this attack but with him 

00:04:15.719 --> 00:04:19.320
 probably the best place to hide when he's not going to throw the 

00:04:19.319 --> 00:04:21.499
 proclaimer 

00:04:21.499 --> 00:04:25.069
 the reason is because here in this position is the background is very dark and long 

00:04:25.069 --> 00:04:27.699
 that most people do not realize that this year 

00:04:27.699 --> 00:04:31.569
 now the part of the territory really want is very normal 

00:04:32.180 --> 00:04:35.219
 unlike last day we have already analyzed wikileaks 

00:04:35.219 --> 00:04:38.219
 said figure nearby mine and when it is firing the 

00:04:39.430 --> 00:04:42.580
 but it does something different that it seems to me that it is a very good practice for 

00:04:42.580 --> 00:04:45.120
 all we want to learn to use better 

00:04:45.120 --> 00:04:49.160
 and that is that this one they realize michael encounter we locate enemy where 

00:04:49.160 --> 00:04:53.160
 there are the red squares of shooting the maps and leaves 

00:04:54.430 --> 00:04:56.770
 deans thickened in mind that it was passed several times 

00:04:56.770 --> 00:05:01.410
 michael to make a false sense of security to the enemies what the shock 

00:05:01.410 --> 00:05:05.090
 with them Spain insists is you have ever been given that they receive a palace 

00:05:06.279 --> 00:05:09.449
 heal account that sometimes the helicopter keeps moving as at this moment 

00:05:09.449 --> 00:05:11.520
 If you think you've left 

00:05:11.520 --> 00:05:14.800
 she leaves and when you see him the booby does not seem to be going out and 

00:05:14.800 --> 00:05:18.720
 actually just that michael stopped firing then said yes 

00:05:18.720 --> 00:05:21.020
 achieve that the enemies that are hidden in buildings 

00:05:21.020 --> 00:05:22.289
 it is known in advance 

00:05:22.289 --> 00:05:26.210
 now just as I had done very free in the azkena last party in the 

00:05:26.210 --> 00:05:28.680
 combination of facts remains with excellent dogs 

00:05:28.680 --> 00:05:31.849
 and now sends your last that you who plan is to foresee 

00:05:31.849 --> 00:05:34.169
 in part to all these reds 

00:05:34.169 --> 00:05:36.490
 and is that the entity after she took out all her life 

00:05:36.490 --> 00:05:41.660
 3 35 37 deaths that I up to now an incredible streak it's time to ex of 

00:05:41.660 --> 00:05:44.460
 kate be selfish and allow colleagues to 

00:05:44.460 --> 00:05:47.590
 share this 15 that at the top with him hahaha 

00:05:49.759 --> 00:05:52.759
 I really like God and the game mode of richie porte 

00:05:53.379 --> 00:05:56.689
 imagine a person who was the scientific print is made 

00:05:56.689 --> 00:05:58.810
 percent that there really is no term 

00:05:58.810 --> 00:05:59.719
 when I started 

00:05:59.719 --> 00:06:03.009
 and once again orihuela after forty because I had to die 

00:06:03.009 --> 00:06:05.439
 and as a person who 

00:06:05.439 --> 00:06:06.800
 always play the game 

00:06:06.800 --> 00:06:09.800
 what a streak of 40 deaths inc 

00:06:10.949 --> 00:06:15.499
 then in two kicks these bugs performed by a hundred I hope to be 

00:06:15.499 --> 00:06:18.809
 I really like the video and I hope that next time when we will analyze some 

00:06:18.809 --> 00:06:19.909
 another product see you later
