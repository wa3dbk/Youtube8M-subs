 with me everything calm as far as 

00:00:07.470 --> 00:00:13.590
 possible and today I have brought here 

00:00:10.769 --> 00:00:16.350
 a different angle of cane a new 

00:00:13.590 --> 00:00:17.880
 lease is that I made a high cost to 

00:00:16.350 --> 00:00:19.529
 pick up your location here 

00:00:17.880 --> 00:00:21.810
 of course it's not my kitchen of that 

00:00:19.529 --> 00:00:24.630
 Let's see what's inside the 

00:00:21.810 --> 00:00:26.880
 I can not see the refrigerator because the 

00:00:24.630 --> 00:00:29.279
 love does not favor beauty but it does not 

00:00:26.880 --> 00:00:30.660
 matter now believe it or not I did not 

00:00:29.279 --> 00:00:31.769
 a video to show the content of the 

00:00:30.660 --> 00:00:34.260
 my fridge 

00:00:31.769 --> 00:00:37.950
 I made this video here to talk to 

00:00:34.260 --> 00:00:39.210
 What's the next series about? 

00:00:37.950 --> 00:00:41.100
 here on the channel 

00:00:39.210 --> 00:00:43.500
 I already decided of course with the generation goes 

00:00:41.100 --> 00:00:46.559
 to be neither will be the second and will be the 

00:00:43.500 --> 00:00:49.730
 the second generation remastered 

00:00:46.559 --> 00:00:51.780
 officials he has already done to those who are 

00:00:49.730 --> 00:00:53.910
 repetitive with each other 

00:00:51.780 --> 00:00:55.829
 those that are not similar was the 

00:00:53.910 --> 00:00:57.989
 only one I have not done for all 

00:00:55.829 --> 00:01:00.180
 I wanted to do this series with you here 

00:00:57.989 --> 00:01:01.500
 A lot of you have already asked me 

00:01:00.180 --> 00:01:03.629
 her in the comments 

00:01:01.500 --> 00:01:05.760

00:01:32.100 --> 00:01:37.280
 of liberations I think that shibud is 

00:01:34.710 --> 00:01:40.229
 more publicized than the other apparently 

00:01:37.280 --> 00:01:42.240
 but I'll try to play regardless of that 

00:01:40.229 --> 00:01:42.869
 If it works, it will not work. 

00:01:42.240 --> 00:01:44.490

 To choose the game here, I'll play. 

00:02:49.709 --> 00:02:53.489

 vote in order to participate in this 

00:03:01.170 --> 00:03:05.129
 here and the platinum pokémon of 

00:03:03.989 --> 00:03:08.190
 breaking up is over 

00:03:05.129 --> 00:03:10.440
 you have seen that you have followed the series 

00:03:08.190 --> 00:03:13.530
 with me that had a bug there in the end 

00:03:10.440 --> 00:03:15.720
 salvage and such thing is a little bit 

00:03:13.530 --> 00:03:18.000
 You can not solve because it has a 

00:03:15.720 --> 00:03:21.030
 A little there can not but not have 

00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:22.950
 I'll keep trying if I 

00:03:21.030 --> 00:03:24.989
 unable to proceed wonder continues 

00:03:22.950 --> 00:03:28.290
 so sporadically with some 

00:03:24.989 --> 00:03:30.810
 Post-game videos though if not 

00:03:28.290 --> 00:03:33.120
 also not as harmful because it already 

00:03:30.810 --> 00:03:35.580
 we got where we wanted it 's the goal 

00:03:33.120 --> 00:03:39.420
 main was solved was completed 

00:03:35.580 --> 00:03:42.000
 which was to win the 24th and the champion 

00:03:39.420 --> 00:03:42.930
 this we have already done that is the primordial then 

00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:45.659
 for me 

00:03:42.930 --> 00:03:47.609
 Calm down, it's already a good case. 

00:03:45.659 --> 00:03:50.040
 Can you solve it for me or not ? 

00:03:47.609 --> 00:03:51.719
 situation is already blocked by the 

00:03:50.040 --> 00:03:53.939
 law but I'll try it now 

00:03:51.719 --> 00:03:55.739
 however the next series starts beyond 

00:03:53.939 --> 00:03:57.599
 anyway is because dying of old 

00:03:55.739 --> 00:03:59.819
 soulsilver pokémon did not want to 

00:03:57.599 --> 00:04:03.120
 start something for right now does not have a 

00:03:59.819 --> 00:04:05.430
 exact time yet but I believe that 

00:04:03.120 --> 00:04:08.370
 still in September is not 

00:04:05.430 --> 00:04:11.040
 certainty not everything here affirmative 100% 

00:04:08.370 --> 00:04:14.219
 Concrete but I think it's going to roll here. 

00:04:11.040 --> 00:04:16.079
 the series will begin in September 

00:04:14.219 --> 00:04:20.609
 I hope so much anyone who wants to participate 

00:04:16.079 --> 00:04:23.160
 go there in the description the vote and participate 

00:04:20.609 --> 00:04:25.139
 because this is going to help a lot here 

00:04:23.160 --> 00:04:27.509
 So I'll decide how it's going to be. 

00:04:25.139 --> 00:04:28.650
 next series how this video here is only 

00:04:27.509 --> 00:04:30.210
 an appointment 

00:04:28.650 --> 00:04:32.729

00:04:30.210 --> 00:04:35.849

00:04:32.729 --> 00:04:37.860

 more not shared zinha if you want 

00:04:56.039 --> 00:05:00.060
 but that to really assemble is just one 

00:04:57.840 --> 00:05:02.010
 I do not need a lot of consultation request 

00:05:00.060 --> 00:05:03.780

00:05:02.010 --> 00:05:06.180
