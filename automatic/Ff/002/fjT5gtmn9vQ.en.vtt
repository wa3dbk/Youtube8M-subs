everyone its Ken here with Mike our cube

00:00:26.279 --> 00:00:28.189 
everyone its Ken here with Mike our cube
comm<00:00:26.759> and<00:00:26.970> today<00:00:27.599> we're<00:00:27.779> gonna<00:00:27.869> talk<00:00:28.169> about

00:00:28.189 --> 00:00:28.199 
comm and today we're gonna talk about

00:00:28.199 --> 00:00:30.729 
comm and today we're gonna talk about
the<00:00:28.529> difference<00:00:28.829> between<00:00:29.060> rotary<00:00:30.060> buffers

00:00:30.729 --> 00:00:30.739 
the difference between rotary buffers

00:00:30.739 --> 00:00:35.420 
the difference between rotary buffers
dual<00:00:31.739> action<00:00:31.980> or<00:00:32.550> da<00:00:33.149> as<00:00:33.629> they<00:00:33.960> say<00:00:34.430> polishes

00:00:35.420 --> 00:00:35.430 
dual action or da as they say polishes

00:00:35.430 --> 00:00:38.329 
dual action or da as they say polishes
and<00:00:35.460> buffers<00:00:35.940> and<00:00:36.180> just<00:00:37.019> orbital<00:00:37.680> so<00:00:38.010> there's

00:00:38.329 --> 00:00:38.339 
and buffers and just orbital so there's

00:00:38.339 --> 00:00:40.100 
and buffers and just orbital so there's
three<00:00:38.640> main<00:00:38.670> different<00:00:39.239> kinds<00:00:39.629> and<00:00:39.809> there's<00:00:40.019> a

00:00:40.100 --> 00:00:40.110 
three main different kinds and there's a

00:00:40.110 --> 00:00:41.149 
three main different kinds and there's a
lot<00:00:40.230> of<00:00:40.350> different<00:00:40.680> brands<00:00:40.890> and<00:00:41.070> different

00:00:41.149 --> 00:00:41.159 
lot of different brands and different

00:00:41.159 --> 00:00:44.299 
lot of different brands and different
styles<00:00:41.820> but<00:00:42.360> those<00:00:42.510> are<00:00:42.659> the<00:00:42.720> three<00:00:43.309> main

00:00:44.299 --> 00:00:44.309 
styles but those are the three main

00:00:44.309 --> 00:00:48.410 
styles but those are the three main
types<00:00:44.699> of<00:00:45.559> paint<00:00:46.559> correction<00:00:47.210> buffers<00:00:48.210> or

00:00:48.410 --> 00:00:48.420 
types of paint correction buffers or

00:00:48.420 --> 00:00:50.389 
types of paint correction buffers or
polishers<00:00:48.930> as<00:00:49.110> you<00:00:49.229> can<00:00:49.350> call<00:00:49.530> them<00:00:49.649> this<00:00:50.129> one

00:00:50.389 --> 00:00:50.399 
polishers as you can call them this one

00:00:50.399 --> 00:00:52.729 
polishers as you can call them this one
you're<00:00:50.519> looking<00:00:50.640> at<00:00:50.879> right<00:00:51.089> here<00:00:51.120> is<00:00:51.540> a<00:00:52.260> full

00:00:56.630 --> 00:00:56.640 
say when you hear the word rotary buffer

00:00:56.640 --> 00:00:59.359 
say when you hear the word rotary buffer
that's<00:00:57.330> what<00:00:57.540> this<00:00:57.689> is<00:00:57.930> this<00:00:58.470> is<00:00:58.530> generally

00:00:59.359 --> 00:00:59.369

someone that knows what they're doing
because<00:01:03.540> this<00:01:04.290> is<00:01:04.619> the<00:01:04.979> tool<00:01:05.159> that<00:01:05.369> you<00:01:05.460> can

00:01:05.570 --> 00:01:05.580 
because this is the tool that you can

00:01:05.580 --> 00:01:07.850 
because this is the tool that you can
burn<00:01:05.880> through<00:01:06.180> paint<00:01:06.540> with<00:01:06.720> because<00:01:07.530> it's

00:01:07.850 --> 00:01:07.860 
burn through paint with because it's

00:01:07.860 --> 00:01:09.890 
burn through paint with because it's
it's<00:01:08.189> forced<00:01:08.640> rotation<00:01:09.210> and<00:01:09.450> it's<00:01:09.570> not<00:01:09.750> going

00:01:09.890 --> 00:01:09.900 
it's forced rotation and it's not going

00:01:09.900 --> 00:01:11.420 
it's forced rotation and it's not going
to<00:01:09.960> stop<00:01:10.200> if<00:01:10.380> you<00:01:10.500> put<00:01:10.650> your<00:01:10.799> hand<00:01:11.009> on<00:01:11.130> it<00:01:11.310> it'll

00:01:11.420 --> 00:01:11.430 
to stop if you put your hand on it it'll

00:01:11.430 --> 00:01:13.429 
to stop if you put your hand on it it'll
spit<00:01:11.729> your<00:01:11.820> hand<00:01:12.060> right<00:01:12.270> off<00:01:12.450> of<00:01:12.479> it<00:01:12.750> so<00:01:13.290> it's

00:01:13.429 --> 00:01:13.439 
spit your hand right off of it so it's

00:01:13.439 --> 00:01:15.920 
spit your hand right off of it so it's
very<00:01:13.500> powerful<00:01:13.950> it's<00:01:14.700> used<00:01:15.000> to<00:01:15.180> get<00:01:15.329> out<00:01:15.479> deep

00:01:15.920 --> 00:01:15.930 
very powerful it's used to get out deep

00:01:15.930 --> 00:01:18.920 
very powerful it's used to get out deep
deep<00:01:16.710> scratches<00:01:17.250> and<00:01:17.790> imperfections<00:01:17.939> in<00:01:18.900> the

00:01:18.920 --> 00:01:18.930 
deep scratches and imperfections in the

00:01:18.930 --> 00:01:20.870 
deep scratches and imperfections in the
paint<00:01:19.130> but<00:01:20.130> you<00:01:20.220> can<00:01:20.369> burn<00:01:20.579> right<00:01:20.820> through

00:01:20.870 --> 00:01:20.880 
paint but you can burn right through

00:01:20.880 --> 00:01:22.520 
paint but you can burn right through
coats<00:01:21.299> of<00:01:21.450> paint<00:01:21.600> you<00:01:21.899> know<00:01:21.990> burning<00:01:22.259> through

00:01:22.520 --> 00:01:22.530 
coats of paint you know burning through

00:01:22.530 --> 00:01:24.289 
coats of paint you know burning through
the<00:01:22.649> clear<00:01:22.950> is<00:01:23.189> what<00:01:23.369> they<00:01:23.520> say<00:01:23.729> well<00:01:24.270> that

00:01:24.289 --> 00:01:24.299 
the clear is what they say well that

00:01:24.299 --> 00:01:25.580 
the clear is what they say well that
just<00:01:24.509> means<00:01:24.659> you<00:01:24.840> burn<00:01:25.079> through<00:01:25.259> the<00:01:25.380> clear

00:01:25.580 --> 00:01:25.590 
just means you burn through the clear

00:01:25.590 --> 00:01:27.500 
just means you burn through the clear
coat<00:01:25.799> and<00:01:26.070> you<00:01:26.159> you<00:01:26.579> would<00:01:26.729> have<00:01:26.939> to<00:01:27.120> repaint

00:01:27.500 --> 00:01:27.510 
coat and you you would have to repaint

00:01:27.510 --> 00:01:29.870 
coat and you you would have to repaint
it<00:01:27.690> and<00:01:27.900> so<00:01:28.710> and<00:01:29.010> you<00:01:29.040> can<00:01:29.190> smell<00:01:29.490> it<00:01:29.670> when<00:01:29.760> it

00:01:29.870 --> 00:01:29.880 
it and so and you can smell it when it

00:01:29.880 --> 00:01:31.100 
it and so and you can smell it when it
burns<00:01:30.120> and<00:01:30.360> so<00:01:30.479> it's<00:01:30.630> very<00:01:30.870> powerful

00:01:31.100 --> 00:01:31.110 
burns and so it's very powerful

00:01:31.110 --> 00:01:33.260 
burns and so it's very powerful
something<00:01:32.070> you<00:01:32.190> can<00:01:32.370> I<00:01:32.550> mean<00:01:32.610> it<00:01:32.970> literally

00:01:33.260 --> 00:01:33.270 
something you can I mean it literally

00:01:33.270 --> 00:01:36.170 
something you can I mean it literally
put<00:01:33.870> scratches<00:01:34.350> in<00:01:34.770> the<00:01:34.800> paint<00:01:35.030> taking<00:01:36.030> them

00:01:36.170 --> 00:01:36.180 
put scratches in the paint taking them

00:01:36.180 --> 00:01:37.880 
put scratches in the paint taking them
out<00:01:36.360> so<00:01:36.600> it's<00:01:36.750> something<00:01:36.960> that<00:01:37.140> you<00:01:37.500> know<00:01:37.800> if

00:01:37.880 --> 00:01:37.890 
out so it's something that you know if

00:01:37.890 --> 00:01:40.730 
out so it's something that you know if
you<00:01:37.979> just<00:01:38.010> a<00:01:38.720> weekend<00:01:39.720> detail<00:01:40.049> or<00:01:40.229> something

00:01:40.730 --> 00:01:40.740 
you just a weekend detail or something

00:01:40.740 --> 00:01:42.050 
you just a weekend detail or something
you<00:01:40.979> know<00:01:41.070> someone's<00:01:41.370> just<00:01:41.460> getting<00:01:41.729> into<00:01:41.940> it

00:01:42.050 --> 00:01:42.060 
you know someone's just getting into it

00:01:42.060 --> 00:01:43.910 
you know someone's just getting into it
you<00:01:42.420> definitely<00:01:42.690> do<00:01:43.080> not<00:01:43.110> want<00:01:43.320> to<00:01:43.530> start<00:01:43.740> with

00:01:43.910 --> 00:01:43.920 
you definitely do not want to start with

00:01:43.920 --> 00:01:45.320 
you definitely do not want to start with
this<00:01:44.100> unless<00:01:44.460> you<00:01:44.640> have<00:01:44.790> someone<00:01:45.000> there<00:01:45.150> to

00:01:45.320 --> 00:01:45.330 
this unless you have someone there to

00:01:45.330 --> 00:01:47.570 
this unless you have someone there to
kind<00:01:45.510> of<00:01:45.600> show<00:01:46.110> you<00:01:46.170> the<00:01:46.350> ropes<00:01:46.560> so<00:01:47.100> this<00:01:47.280> is<00:01:47.549> a

00:01:47.570 --> 00:01:47.580 
kind of show you the ropes so this is a

00:01:47.580 --> 00:01:50.570 
kind of show you the ropes so this is a
rotary<00:01:48.299> polished<00:01:49.260> buffer<00:01:49.740> polisher<00:01:50.220> and<00:01:50.430> it

00:01:50.570 --> 00:01:50.580 
rotary polished buffer polisher and it

00:01:50.580 --> 00:01:52.580 
rotary polished buffer polisher and it
it<00:01:51.180> looks<00:01:51.420> like<00:01:51.600> that<00:01:51.780> it<00:01:51.960> simply<00:01:52.380> just

00:01:52.580 --> 00:01:52.590 
it looks like that it simply just

00:01:52.590 --> 00:01:55.370 
it looks like that it simply just
rotates<00:01:53.100> in<00:01:53.220> a<00:01:53.310> circle<00:01:54.290> revolutions<00:01:55.290> per

00:01:55.370 --> 00:01:55.380 
rotates in a circle revolutions per

00:01:55.380 --> 00:01:57.320 
rotates in a circle revolutions per
minute<00:01:55.560> and<00:01:55.950> so<00:01:56.130> that's<00:01:56.280> kind<00:01:56.520> of<00:01:56.580> the<00:01:57.090> guide<00:01:57.299> I

00:01:57.320 --> 00:01:57.330 
minute and so that's kind of the guide I

00:01:57.330 --> 00:01:59.210 
minute and so that's kind of the guide I
just<00:01:57.720> made<00:01:57.930> really<00:01:58.320> quick<00:01:58.619> so<00:01:58.770> you<00:01:58.830> can<00:01:59.040> kind

00:01:59.210 --> 00:01:59.220 
just made really quick so you can kind

00:01:59.220 --> 00:02:01.789 
just made really quick so you can kind
of<00:01:59.280> see<00:01:59.520> the<00:02:00.150> visual<00:02:00.570> part<00:02:00.810> as<00:02:00.990> I'm<00:02:01.260> talking<00:02:01.470> as

00:02:01.789 --> 00:02:01.799 
of see the visual part as I'm talking as

00:02:01.799 --> 00:02:04.250 
of see the visual part as I'm talking as
well<00:02:02.070> so<00:02:02.700> there's<00:02:02.970> no<00:02:03.150> other<00:02:03.330> movement<00:02:03.630> except

00:02:04.250 --> 00:02:04.260 
well so there's no other movement except

00:02:04.260 --> 00:02:07.429 
well so there's no other movement except
for<00:02:04.470> just<00:02:04.740> one<00:02:05.510> rotation<00:02:06.510> and<00:02:06.689> that's<00:02:06.840> it<00:02:07.200> and

00:02:07.429 --> 00:02:07.439 
for just one rotation and that's it and

00:02:07.439 --> 00:02:11.089 
for just one rotation and that's it and
so<00:02:08.280> this<00:02:08.549> is<00:02:08.789> the<00:02:09.330> rotary<00:02:09.750> polisher<00:02:10.379> the<00:02:10.830> next

00:02:11.089 --> 00:02:11.099 
so this is the rotary polisher the next

00:02:11.099 --> 00:02:12.920 
so this is the rotary polisher the next
one<00:02:11.250> we're<00:02:11.400> going<00:02:11.489> to<00:02:11.549> talk<00:02:11.790> about<00:02:12.120> is<00:02:12.360> the

00:02:12.920 --> 00:02:12.930 
one we're going to talk about is the

00:02:12.930 --> 00:02:16.369 
one we're going to talk about is the
dual<00:02:13.110> action<00:02:13.379> polisher<00:02:14.540> thank<00:02:15.540> you<00:02:15.689> very<00:02:15.840> much

00:02:16.379 --> 00:02:19.360 
dual action polisher thank you very much
and<00:02:17.099> this<00:02:17.939> is<00:02:18.090> the<00:02:18.180> dual<00:02:18.360> action<00:02:18.540> or<00:02:18.870> da

00:02:19.360 --> 00:02:19.370 
and this is the dual action or da

00:02:19.370 --> 00:02:21.380 
and this is the dual action or da
there's<00:02:20.370> a<00:02:20.430> few<00:02:20.640> different<00:02:20.879> brands<00:02:21.120> out<00:02:21.360> there

00:02:21.380 --> 00:02:21.390 
there's a few different brands out there

00:02:21.390 --> 00:02:23.509 
there's a few different brands out there
like<00:02:22.110> the<00:02:22.230> porter-cable<00:02:22.500> some<00:02:23.099> people<00:02:23.340> call

00:02:23.509 --> 00:02:23.519 
like the porter-cable some people call

00:02:23.519 --> 00:02:27.140 
like the porter-cable some people call
that<00:02:23.549> the<00:02:23.700> PC<00:02:24.560> so<00:02:25.560> dual<00:02:25.980> action<00:02:26.220> means<00:02:26.670> it<00:02:26.939> not

00:02:27.140 --> 00:02:27.150 
that the PC so dual action means it not

00:02:27.150 --> 00:02:29.270 
that the PC so dual action means it not
only<00:02:27.330> rotates<00:02:28.019> around<00:02:28.200> in<00:02:28.590> a<00:02:28.650> circle<00:02:28.890> like<00:02:29.129> the

00:02:29.270 --> 00:02:29.280 
only rotates around in a circle like the

00:02:29.280 --> 00:02:31.849 
only rotates around in a circle like the
other<00:02:29.430> one<00:02:29.610> but<00:02:30.510> as<00:02:30.689> you<00:02:31.019> can<00:02:31.139> see<00:02:31.200> there's<00:02:31.560> you

00:02:31.849 --> 00:02:31.859 
other one but as you can see there's you

00:02:31.859 --> 00:02:33.890 
other one but as you can see there's you
can<00:02:32.010> see<00:02:32.129> a<00:02:32.159> difference<00:02:32.489> already<00:02:32.730> kind<00:02:33.450> of<00:02:33.599> you

00:02:33.890 --> 00:02:33.900 
can see a difference already kind of you

00:02:33.900 --> 00:02:36.289 
can see a difference already kind of you
know<00:02:34.019> free<00:02:34.529> movement<00:02:34.799> basically<00:02:35.579> so<00:02:35.999> not<00:02:36.180> only

00:02:36.289 --> 00:02:36.299 
know free movement basically so not only

00:02:36.299 --> 00:02:36.890 
know free movement basically so not only
does<00:02:36.599> it

00:02:36.890 --> 00:02:36.900 
does it

00:02:36.900 --> 00:02:38.630 
does it
turn<00:02:36.989> around<00:02:37.530> you<00:02:37.709> know<00:02:37.829> go<00:02:38.069> around<00:02:38.400> in<00:02:38.579> a

00:02:38.630 --> 00:02:38.640 
turn around you know go around in a

00:02:38.640 --> 00:02:41.569 
turn around you know go around in a
circle<00:02:38.879> but<00:02:39.180> also<00:02:39.840> oscillates<00:02:40.620> it<00:02:41.340> kind<00:02:41.519> of

00:02:41.569 --> 00:02:41.579 
circle but also oscillates it kind of

00:02:41.579 --> 00:02:43.729 
circle but also oscillates it kind of
mimics<00:02:41.819> the<00:02:42.269> the<00:02:42.569> humans<00:02:42.930> hand<00:02:43.170> movement<00:02:43.620> when

00:02:43.729 --> 00:02:43.739 
mimics the the humans hand movement when

00:02:43.739 --> 00:02:45.440 
mimics the the humans hand movement when
you're<00:02:43.890> polishing<00:02:44.459> and<00:02:44.579> you<00:02:44.970> know<00:02:45.090> putting<00:02:45.299> on

00:02:45.440 --> 00:02:45.450 
you're polishing and you know putting on

00:02:45.450 --> 00:02:48.380 
you're polishing and you know putting on
wax<00:02:45.659> yourself<00:02:46.170> so<00:02:46.799> there's<00:02:47.040> this<00:02:47.519> is<00:02:47.790> probably

00:02:48.380 --> 00:02:48.390 
wax yourself so there's this is probably

00:02:48.390 --> 00:02:49.970 
wax yourself so there's this is probably
my<00:02:48.659> favorite<00:02:49.140> because<00:02:49.260> it's<00:02:49.650> the<00:02:49.739> most

00:02:49.970 --> 00:02:49.980 
my favorite because it's the most

00:02:49.980 --> 00:02:52.729 
my favorite because it's the most
versatile<00:02:50.549> you<00:02:51.299> could<00:02:51.480> take<00:02:51.689> this<00:02:51.930> then<00:02:52.500> get

00:02:52.729 --> 00:02:52.739 
versatile you could take this then get

00:02:52.739 --> 00:02:54.920 
versatile you could take this then get
out<00:02:52.890> you<00:02:53.519> know<00:02:53.640> fairly<00:02:53.939> moderate<00:02:54.359> scratches

00:02:54.920 --> 00:02:54.930 
out you know fairly moderate scratches

00:02:54.930 --> 00:02:57.470 
out you know fairly moderate scratches
and<00:02:55.109> then<00:02:56.040> also<00:02:56.519> you<00:02:56.579> could<00:02:56.730> turn<00:02:56.879> around<00:02:56.939> put

00:02:57.470 --> 00:02:57.480 
and then also you could turn around put

00:02:57.480 --> 00:02:58.759 
and then also you could turn around put
a<00:02:57.510> different<00:02:57.659> pad<00:02:57.959> on<00:02:58.140> it<00:02:58.290> in<00:02:58.379> a<00:02:58.439> different

00:02:58.759 --> 00:02:58.769 
a different pad on it in a different

00:02:58.769 --> 00:03:00.710 
a different pad on it in a different
speed<00:02:59.040> and<00:02:59.220> put<00:02:59.700> a<00:02:59.730> coat<00:02:59.909> of<00:02:59.939> wax<00:03:00.150> on<00:03:00.420> it<00:03:00.450> so

00:03:00.710 --> 00:03:00.720 
speed and put a coat of wax on it so

00:03:00.720 --> 00:03:04.309 
speed and put a coat of wax on it so
this<00:03:01.220> generally<00:03:02.220> speaking<00:03:02.670> is<00:03:03.319> 99%

00:03:04.309 --> 00:03:04.319 
this generally speaking is 99%

00:03:04.319 --> 00:03:06.259 
this generally speaking is 99%
impossible<00:03:05.310> to<00:03:05.489> burn<00:03:05.670> through<00:03:05.909> the<00:03:06.000> paint

00:03:06.259 --> 00:03:06.269

here I have a line with a sharpie that's

00:03:37.680 --> 00:03:39.170 
here I have a line with a sharpie that's
to<00:03:37.889> make<00:03:38.010> sure<00:03:38.189> I<00:03:38.220> want<00:03:38.549> to<00:03:38.609> see<00:03:38.760> that<00:03:38.909> line

00:03:39.170 --> 00:03:39.180 
to make sure I want to see that line

00:03:39.180 --> 00:03:41.000 
to make sure I want to see that line
spinning<00:03:39.870> around<00:03:40.170> so<00:03:40.409> I<00:03:40.439> know<00:03:40.560> it's<00:03:40.829> moving

00:03:41.000 --> 00:03:41.010 
spinning around so I know it's moving

00:03:41.010 --> 00:03:42.770 
spinning around so I know it's moving
correctly<00:03:41.430> when<00:03:41.760> I'm<00:03:41.879> when<00:03:42.209> I'm<00:03:42.329> polishing

00:03:42.770 --> 00:03:42.780 
correctly when I'm when I'm polishing

00:03:42.780 --> 00:03:44.449 
correctly when I'm when I'm polishing
because<00:03:42.870> one<00:03:43.139> when<00:03:43.620> this<00:03:43.739> thing<00:03:43.919> turns<00:03:43.949> on<00:03:44.310> you

00:03:44.449 --> 00:03:44.459 
because one when this thing turns on you

00:03:44.459 --> 00:03:46.039 
because one when this thing turns on you
can't<00:03:44.639> really<00:03:44.790> tell<00:03:45.030> just<00:03:45.269> because<00:03:45.419> it's<00:03:45.569> has

00:03:46.039 --> 00:03:46.049 
can't really tell just because it's has

00:03:46.049 --> 00:03:47.780 
can't really tell just because it's has
a<00:03:46.109> halo<00:03:46.470> around<00:03:46.590> it<00:03:46.889> just<00:03:47.040> because<00:03:47.220> of<00:03:47.400> how<00:03:47.639> it

00:03:47.780 --> 00:03:47.790 
a halo around it just because of how it

00:03:47.790 --> 00:03:49.819 
a halo around it just because of how it
moves<00:03:48.060> and<00:03:48.359> so<00:03:48.959> this<00:03:49.230> is<00:03:49.379> called<00:03:49.530> the<00:03:49.680> dual

00:03:49.819 --> 00:03:49.829 
moves and so this is called the dual

00:03:49.829 --> 00:03:52.520 
moves and so this is called the dual
action<00:03:50.069> and<00:03:50.519> that's<00:03:51.389> how<00:03:51.629> its<00:03:51.870> pattern<00:03:52.260> looks

00:03:52.520 --> 00:03:52.530 
action and that's how its pattern looks

00:03:52.530 --> 00:03:54.080 
action and that's how its pattern looks
what<00:03:52.799> it<00:03:52.919> makes<00:03:53.099> so<00:03:53.340> it's<00:03:53.459> a<00:03:53.519> lot<00:03:53.909> different

00:03:54.080 --> 00:03:54.090 
what it makes so it's a lot different

00:03:54.090 --> 00:03:56.270 
what it makes so it's a lot different
from<00:03:54.329> the<00:03:54.480> rotary<00:03:54.959> and<00:03:55.169> each<00:03:55.799> have<00:03:56.010> their<00:03:56.159> own

00:03:56.270 --> 00:03:56.280 
from the rotary and each have their own

00:03:56.280 --> 00:04:00.080 
from the rotary and each have their own
specific<00:03:56.609> use<00:03:57.590> so<00:03:58.590> keep<00:03:59.099> that<00:03:59.250> in<00:03:59.400> mind<00:03:59.609> the

00:04:00.080 --> 00:04:00.090 
specific use so keep that in mind the

00:04:00.090 --> 00:04:02.030 
specific use so keep that in mind the
next<00:04:00.120> one<00:04:00.540> we're<00:04:00.690> going<00:04:00.840> to<00:04:00.900> talk<00:04:01.139> about<00:04:01.169> is

00:04:02.030 --> 00:04:02.040 
next one we're going to talk about is

00:04:02.040 --> 00:04:04.129 
next one we're going to talk about is
strictly<00:04:02.579> it's<00:04:02.879> just<00:04:03.120> an<00:04:03.209> orbital<00:04:03.750> it's<00:04:03.989> like

00:04:04.129 --> 00:04:04.139 
strictly it's just an orbital it's like

00:04:04.139 --> 00:04:07.039 
strictly it's just an orbital it's like
thirty<00:04:04.590> dollar<00:04:04.829> ones<00:04:05.190> you<00:04:05.400> can<00:04:05.549> get<00:04:05.790> at<00:04:06.780> your

00:04:07.039 --> 00:04:07.049 
thirty dollar ones you can get at your

00:04:07.049 --> 00:04:09.110 
thirty dollar ones you can get at your
wall<00:04:07.739> grocery<00:04:08.220> store<00:04:08.430> even<00:04:08.579> I've<00:04:08.790> seen<00:04:09.000> them

00:04:09.110 --> 00:04:09.120 
wall grocery store even I've seen them

00:04:09.120 --> 00:04:13.969 
wall grocery store even I've seen them
this<00:04:09.870> is<00:04:10.079> definitely<00:04:12.139> like<00:04:13.139> an<00:04:13.319> enthusiast

00:04:13.969 --> 00:04:13.979 
this is definitely like an enthusiast

00:04:13.979 --> 00:04:15.890 
this is definitely like an enthusiast
tool<00:04:14.310> it's<00:04:14.519> not<00:04:14.699> really<00:04:15.120> it's<00:04:15.239> not<00:04:15.389> gonna<00:04:15.569> do

00:04:15.890 --> 00:04:15.900 
tool it's not really it's not gonna do

00:04:15.900 --> 00:04:18.080 
tool it's not really it's not gonna do
any<00:04:16.019> paint<00:04:16.320> correction<00:04:16.470> pretty<00:04:17.459> much<00:04:17.639> all<00:04:17.909> it

00:04:18.080 --> 00:04:18.090 
any paint correction pretty much all it

00:04:18.090 --> 00:04:21.229 
any paint correction pretty much all it
does<00:04:18.299> is<00:04:18.570> spreads<00:04:19.019> on<00:04:19.139> a<00:04:19.169> coat<00:04:19.440> of<00:04:19.470> wax<00:04:19.680> and<00:04:20.239> I

00:04:21.229 --> 00:04:21.239 
does is spreads on a coat of wax and I

00:04:21.239 --> 00:04:23.210 
does is spreads on a coat of wax and I
mean<00:04:21.539> it's<00:04:21.720> it's<00:04:21.959> not<00:04:22.109> completely<00:04:22.560> useless<00:04:22.830> I

00:04:23.210 --> 00:04:23.220 
mean it's it's not completely useless I

00:04:23.220 --> 00:04:24.589 
mean it's it's not completely useless I
know<00:04:23.280> guys<00:04:23.550> that<00:04:23.580> love<00:04:23.940> them<00:04:24.150> I<00:04:24.300> know<00:04:24.389> guys

00:04:24.589 --> 00:04:24.599 
know guys that love them I know guys

00:04:24.599 --> 00:04:26.600 
know guys that love them I know guys
that<00:04:24.630> never<00:04:24.870> touch<00:04:25.199> them<00:04:25.409> I<00:04:25.560> have<00:04:26.220> one<00:04:26.460> just

00:04:26.600 --> 00:04:26.610 
that never touch them I have one just

00:04:26.610 --> 00:04:28.159 
that never touch them I have one just
because<00:04:26.760> I<00:04:27.000> like<00:04:27.180> to<00:04:27.300> have<00:04:27.449> all<00:04:27.780> the<00:04:27.900> different

00:04:28.159 --> 00:04:28.169 
because I like to have all the different

00:04:28.169 --> 00:04:30.050 
because I like to have all the different
tools<00:04:28.320> but<00:04:28.680> I<00:04:29.070> mean<00:04:29.280> I<00:04:29.310> can<00:04:29.610> tell<00:04:29.760> you<00:04:29.940> I've

00:04:30.050 --> 00:04:30.060 
tools but I mean I can tell you I've

00:04:30.060 --> 00:04:32.600 
tools but I mean I can tell you I've
probably<00:04:30.360> used<00:04:30.659> this<00:04:31.020> once<00:04:31.440> once<00:04:32.280> or<00:04:32.430> twice

00:04:32.600 --> 00:04:32.610 
probably used this once once or twice

00:04:32.610 --> 00:04:35.480 
probably used this once once or twice
and<00:04:33.150> there's<00:04:33.300> thirty<00:04:33.599> dollar<00:04:33.870> machine

00:04:35.480 --> 00:04:35.490 
and there's thirty dollar machine

00:04:35.490 --> 00:04:37.219 
and there's thirty dollar machine
you<00:04:35.820> know<00:04:35.940> something<00:04:36.330> anyone<00:04:36.659> could<00:04:36.870> pick<00:04:37.020> up

00:04:37.219 --> 00:04:37.229 
you know something anyone could pick up

00:04:37.229 --> 00:04:38.960 
you know something anyone could pick up
you're<00:04:37.440> not<00:04:37.530> gonna<00:04:37.620> damage<00:04:38.010> anything<00:04:38.400> with<00:04:38.760> it

00:04:38.960 --> 00:04:38.970 
you're not gonna damage anything with it

00:04:38.970 --> 00:04:41.120 
you're not gonna damage anything with it
you<00:04:39.630> can't<00:04:39.840> burn<00:04:40.020> through<00:04:40.289> anything<00:04:40.349> it

00:04:41.120 --> 00:04:41.130 
you can't burn through anything it

00:04:41.130 --> 00:04:42.830 
you can't burn through anything it
literally<00:04:41.460> you<00:04:41.639> just<00:04:41.760> put<00:04:42.090> like<00:04:42.210> a<00:04:42.240> bonnet<00:04:42.690> on

00:04:42.830 --> 00:04:42.840 
literally you just put like a bonnet on

00:04:42.840 --> 00:04:45.110 
literally you just put like a bonnet on
this<00:04:43.050> and<00:04:43.320> spread<00:04:43.710> around<00:04:43.800> wax<00:04:44.340> instead<00:04:45.029> of

00:04:45.110 --> 00:04:45.120 
this and spread around wax instead of

00:04:45.120 --> 00:04:47.899 
this and spread around wax instead of
spreading<00:04:45.570> around<00:04:45.860> you<00:04:46.860> know<00:04:46.979> it<00:04:47.490> with<00:04:47.729> your

00:04:47.899 --> 00:04:47.909 
spreading around you know it with your

00:04:47.909 --> 00:04:50.089 
spreading around you know it with your
hands<00:04:48.270> so<00:04:48.300> if<00:04:49.169> you<00:04:49.289> want<00:04:49.500> one<00:04:49.620> of<00:04:49.650> these<00:04:49.800> pick

00:04:50.089 --> 00:04:50.099 
hands so if you want one of these pick

00:04:50.099 --> 00:04:50.660 
hands so if you want one of these pick
one<00:04:50.279> up

00:04:50.660 --> 00:04:50.670 
one up

00:04:50.670 --> 00:04:52.940 
one up
but<00:04:51.000> I<00:04:51.240> suggest<00:04:51.450> that<00:04:52.230> if<00:04:52.380> you're<00:04:52.470> gonna<00:04:52.620> start

00:04:52.940 --> 00:04:52.950 
but I suggest that if you're gonna start

00:04:52.950 --> 00:04:56.360 
but I suggest that if you're gonna start
with<00:04:53.070> one<00:04:53.370> it<00:04:53.670> would<00:04:53.820> be<00:04:53.940> the<00:04:54.090> dual<00:04:54.270> action<00:04:55.370> you

00:04:56.360 --> 00:04:56.370 
with one it would be the dual action you

00:04:56.370 --> 00:04:57.800 
with one it would be the dual action you
know<00:04:56.460> maybe<00:04:56.790> wait<00:04:57.150> till<00:04:57.180> you're<00:04:57.450> a<00:04:57.480> little<00:04:57.690> bit

00:04:57.800 --> 00:04:57.810 
know maybe wait till you're a little bit

00:04:57.810 --> 00:05:01.030 
know maybe wait till you're a little bit
until<00:04:58.530> you<00:04:58.620> understand<00:04:59.070> the<00:04:59.400> full<00:05:00.210> you<00:05:00.780> know

00:05:01.030 --> 00:05:01.040 
until you understand the full you know

00:05:01.040 --> 00:05:03.290 
until you understand the full you know
potential<00:05:02.040> this<00:05:02.190> one<00:05:02.400> before<00:05:02.760> you<00:05:02.850> step<00:05:03.090> up<00:05:03.240> to

00:05:03.290 --> 00:05:03.300 
potential this one before you step up to

00:05:03.300 --> 00:05:05.120 
potential this one before you step up to
the<00:05:03.420> full<00:05:03.720> rotary<00:05:04.140> and<00:05:04.350> a<00:05:04.440> lot<00:05:04.590> of<00:05:04.680> people<00:05:04.890> a

00:05:05.120 --> 00:05:05.130 
the full rotary and a lot of people a

00:05:05.130 --> 00:05:06.680 
the full rotary and a lot of people a
lot<00:05:05.190> of<00:05:05.460> paint<00:05:05.640> I<00:05:05.700> don't<00:05:05.880> even<00:05:06.000> use<00:05:06.240> the<00:05:06.390> rotary

00:05:06.680 --> 00:05:06.690 
lot of paint I don't even use the rotary

00:05:06.690 --> 00:05:08.420 
lot of paint I don't even use the rotary
on<00:05:06.870> because<00:05:07.290> I<00:05:07.320> can<00:05:07.560> get<00:05:07.740> the<00:05:07.920> results<00:05:08.310> with

00:05:08.420 --> 00:05:08.430 
on because I can get the results with

00:05:08.430 --> 00:05:10.760 
on because I can get the results with
the<00:05:08.520> dual<00:05:08.670> action<00:05:08.910> so<00:05:09.780> that's<00:05:10.500> the<00:05:10.620> difference

00:05:10.760 --> 00:05:10.770 
the dual action so that's the difference

00:05:10.770 --> 00:05:14.390 
the dual action so that's the difference
between<00:05:11.630> you<00:05:12.630> know<00:05:12.660> buffers<00:05:13.320> polishers<00:05:14.160> it's

00:05:14.390 --> 00:05:14.400 
between you know buffers polishers it's

00:05:14.400 --> 00:05:16.220 
between you know buffers polishers it's
all<00:05:14.580> kind<00:05:14.850> of<00:05:14.910> the<00:05:15.030> same<00:05:15.060> thing<00:05:15.570> except<00:05:16.170> you

00:05:16.220 --> 00:05:16.230 
all kind of the same thing except you

00:05:16.230 --> 00:05:18.110 
all kind of the same thing except you
got<00:05:16.380> to<00:05:16.530> know<00:05:16.680> which<00:05:17.010> one<00:05:17.280> you're<00:05:17.460> buying<00:05:17.730> and

00:05:18.110 --> 00:05:18.120 
got to know which one you're buying and

00:05:18.120 --> 00:05:20.360 
got to know which one you're buying and
what<00:05:19.080> you<00:05:19.200> need<00:05:19.410> it<00:05:19.560> for<00:05:19.740> and<00:05:19.950> there's<00:05:20.070> others

00:05:20.360 --> 00:05:20.370 
what you need it for and there's others

00:05:20.370 --> 00:05:22.280 
what you need it for and there's others
on<00:05:20.520> the<00:05:20.610> market<00:05:20.640> like<00:05:21.030> a<00:05:21.090> forced<00:05:21.630> rotation

00:05:22.280 --> 00:05:22.290 
on the market like a forced rotation

00:05:22.290 --> 00:05:24.500 
on the market like a forced rotation
dual<00:05:22.500> action<00:05:22.740> which<00:05:23.460> has<00:05:23.490> a<00:05:23.820> little<00:05:24.180> bit<00:05:24.330> more

00:05:24.500 --> 00:05:24.510 
dual action which has a little bit more

00:05:24.510 --> 00:05:26.990 
dual action which has a little bit more
power<00:05:24.750> than<00:05:25.440> the<00:05:25.590> dual<00:05:25.740> action<00:05:25.950> but<00:05:26.430> not<00:05:26.460> quite

00:05:26.990 --> 00:05:27.000 
power than the dual action but not quite

00:05:27.000 --> 00:05:29.630 
power than the dual action but not quite
as<00:05:27.120> much<00:05:27.300> power<00:05:28.200> as<00:05:28.320> the<00:05:28.650> rotor<00:05:28.860> it's<00:05:29.100> it's<00:05:29.460> in

00:05:29.630 --> 00:05:29.640 
as much power as the rotor it's it's in

00:05:29.640 --> 00:05:32.420 
as much power as the rotor it's it's in
the<00:05:29.700> middle<00:05:30.500> you<00:05:31.500> know<00:05:31.620> it<00:05:31.770> has<00:05:31.890> a<00:05:31.920> little<00:05:32.190> bit

00:05:32.420 --> 00:05:32.430 
the middle you know it has a little bit

00:05:32.430 --> 00:05:34.190 
the middle you know it has a little bit
more<00:05:32.490> Correction<00:05:33.150> power<00:05:33.390> but<00:05:33.660> it's<00:05:33.810> not<00:05:33.990> gonna

00:05:34.190 --> 00:05:34.200 
more Correction power but it's not gonna

00:05:34.200 --> 00:05:35.780 
more Correction power but it's not gonna
put<00:05:34.470> as<00:05:34.590> many<00:05:34.710> swirls<00:05:35.130> in<00:05:35.310> the<00:05:35.400> paint<00:05:35.610> it's<00:05:35.730> a

00:05:35.780 --> 00:05:35.790 
put as many swirls in the paint it's a

00:05:35.790 --> 00:05:38.120 
put as many swirls in the paint it's a
little<00:05:36.000> safer<00:05:36.420> so<00:05:36.990> that's<00:05:37.590> just<00:05:37.740> a<00:05:37.890> quick

00:05:38.120 --> 00:05:38.130 
little safer so that's just a quick

00:05:38.130 --> 00:05:40.430 
little safer so that's just a quick
video<00:05:38.340> on<00:05:38.820> the<00:05:39.180> difference<00:05:39.480> between<00:05:39.540> a<00:05:39.900> rotary

00:05:40.430 --> 00:05:40.440 
video on the difference between a rotary

00:05:40.440 --> 00:05:43.190 
video on the difference between a rotary
a<00:05:40.710> dual<00:05:41.280> action<00:05:41.760> and<00:05:41.970> an<00:05:42.120> orbital<00:05:42.360> and<00:05:42.780> like<00:05:43.080> I

00:05:43.190 --> 00:05:43.200 
a dual action and an orbital and like I

00:05:43.200 --> 00:05:44.620 
a dual action and an orbital and like I
said<00:05:43.260> there's<00:05:43.560> several<00:05:43.890> others<00:05:44.160> out<00:05:44.370> there

00:05:44.620 --> 00:05:44.630 
said there's several others out there

00:05:44.630 --> 00:05:48.290 
said there's several others out there
but<00:05:45.630> those<00:05:45.780> are<00:05:45.930> the<00:05:45.960> main<00:05:46.200> ones<00:05:46.760> so<00:05:47.760> that's

00:05:48.290 --> 00:05:48.300 
but those are the main ones so that's

00:05:48.300 --> 00:05:52.040 
but those are the main ones so that's
the<00:05:48.480> next<00:05:48.660> video<00:05:48.990> why<00:05:49.830> you<00:05:49.890> see<00:05:50.220> these<00:05:50.630> why<00:05:51.630> the

00:05:52.040 --> 00:05:52.050 
the next video why you see these why the

00:05:52.050 --> 00:05:53.360 
the next video why you see these why the
reason<00:05:52.320> why<00:05:52.440> you<00:05:52.500> see<00:05:52.740> these<00:05:52.860> polishes<00:05:53.340> and

00:05:53.360 --> 00:05:53.370 
reason why you see these polishes and

00:05:53.370 --> 00:05:55.100 
reason why you see these polishes and
everything<00:05:53.790> like<00:05:53.910> that<00:05:54.180> out<00:05:54.390> is<00:05:54.570> because<00:05:54.750> I

00:05:55.100 --> 00:05:55.110 
everything like that out is because I

00:05:55.110 --> 00:05:56.780 
everything like that out is because I
just<00:05:55.290> did<00:05:55.620> a<00:05:55.650> video<00:05:56.010> on<00:05:56.100> these<00:05:56.280> and<00:05:56.580> I'll<00:05:56.670> be

00:05:56.780 --> 00:05:56.790 
just did a video on these and I'll be

00:05:56.790 --> 00:05:59.060 
just did a video on these and I'll be
uploading<00:05:57.240> the<00:05:57.390> differences<00:05:57.840> between<00:05:58.070> what

00:05:59.060 --> 00:05:59.070 
uploading the differences between what

00:05:59.070 --> 00:06:01.730 
uploading the differences between what
what<00:05:59.310> is<00:05:59.430> a<00:05:59.460> body<00:05:59.760> shop<00:06:00.090> safe<00:06:00.390> wax<00:06:00.750> what<00:06:01.260> isn't
