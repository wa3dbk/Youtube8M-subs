point you're going to lay the rings out

00:00:37.170 --> 00:00:38.930 
point you're going to lay the rings out
so<00:00:37.410> there<00:00:37.559> are<00:00:37.680> three<00:00:37.920> on<00:00:38.040> top<00:00:38.309> and<00:00:38.640> three<00:00:38.910> on

00:00:38.930 --> 00:00:38.940 
so there are three on top and three on

00:00:38.940 --> 00:00:40.970 
so there are three on top and three on
the<00:00:39.059> bottom<00:00:39.510> and<00:00:39.719> you're<00:00:40.620> going<00:00:40.739> to<00:00:40.770> want<00:00:40.950> to

00:00:40.970 --> 00:00:40.980 
the bottom and you're going to want to

00:00:40.980 --> 00:00:42.319 
the bottom and you're going to want to
make<00:00:41.129> sure<00:00:41.370> that<00:00:41.520> they're<00:00:41.670> orientated

take an open ring and you're going to

00:00:53.969 --> 00:00:56.000 
take an open ring and you're going to
slip<00:00:54.180> through<00:00:54.539> the<00:00:54.780> two<00:00:54.960> bottom<00:00:55.379> rings<00:00:55.620> and

00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:56.010 
slip through the two bottom rings and

00:00:56.010 --> 00:00:58.250 
slip through the two bottom rings and
then<00:00:56.850> flip<00:00:57.120> it<00:00:57.210> up<00:00:57.329> and<00:00:57.420> over<00:00:57.600> and<00:00:57.899> then

00:00:58.250 --> 00:00:58.260 
then flip it up and over and then

00:00:58.260 --> 00:01:00.650 
then flip it up and over and then

00:01:00.660 --> 00:01:03.500 
through two of the open or closed rings
on<00:01:00.870> top<00:01:01.579> at<00:01:02.579> this<00:01:02.760> point<00:01:03.059> you're<00:01:03.149> going<00:01:03.239> to<00:01:03.300> add

00:01:03.500 --> 00:01:03.510 
on top at this point you're going to add

00:01:03.510 --> 00:01:06.320 
on top at this point you're going to add
two<00:01:03.930> more<00:01:03.960> closed<00:01:04.500> strings<00:01:04.830> and<00:01:05.220> then<00:01:06.210> you're

00:01:06.320 --> 00:01:06.330

00:01:10.220 --> 00:01:12.170 

now<00:01:11.220> you're<00:01:11.340> going<00:01:11.520> to<00:01:11.610> repeat<00:01:11.820> the<00:01:12.150> process

00:01:12.170 --> 00:01:12.180 
now you're going to repeat the process

00:01:12.180 --> 00:01:15.860 
now you're going to repeat the process
by<00:01:12.990> laying<00:01:13.350> the<00:01:13.560> rings<00:01:13.800> out<00:01:14.630> again<00:01:15.630> in<00:01:15.780> a

00:01:15.860 --> 00:01:15.870 
by laying the rings out again in a

00:01:15.870 --> 00:01:18.200 
by laying the rings out again in a
proper<00:01:16.200> order<00:01:16.230> flip<00:01:17.070> the<00:01:17.190> top<00:01:17.400> ring<00:01:17.640> down<00:01:17.880> and
