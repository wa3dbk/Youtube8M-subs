00:00:00.500 --> 00:00:08.490
 ok six-cylinder engine 

00:00:05.640 --> 00:00:10.889
 suspended on the world frame nor a peter 

00:00:08.490 --> 00:00:13.930
 bauer is the declension in the cooper 

00:00:10.889 --> 00:00:16.660
 in the 6.7 liter choirs 

00:00:13.930 --> 00:00:21.100
 tier 4 liters is equipped with a system here 

00:00:16.660 --> 00:00:24.610
 scr urea is a tractor that 

00:00:21.100 --> 00:00:27.360
 zf transmission March 4 and for 6 legs 

00:00:24.610 --> 00:00:31.270
 arc hypothesized this exclusive for 

00:00:27.360 --> 00:00:32.920
 arbitrate its beauty than others 

00:00:31.270 --> 00:00:37.300
 the actor with similar transmission have 

00:00:32.920 --> 00:00:38.710
 instead the manual legs from the outside 

00:00:37.300 --> 00:00:41.500
 we see that the first detail instead 

00:00:38.710 --> 00:00:45.040
 of the classic malignant on the fender is 

00:00:41.500 --> 00:00:47.720
 A recess was made clearly with 

00:00:45.040 --> 00:00:49.640
 a drain for drain at that 

00:00:47.720 --> 00:00:51.650
 however very comfortable and that does not go to 

00:00:49.640 --> 00:00:53.000
 impact on the writings of the mother is 

00:00:51.650 --> 00:00:54.560
 once you go up you can too 

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:56.960
 notice more if you say yes with the passenger 

00:00:54.560 --> 00:01:00.350
 send a nuisance to the tractor because 

00:00:56.960 --> 00:01:02.030
 thanks to the patented hideaway system the 

00:01:00.350 --> 00:01:04.040
 fully integrated seat of 

00:01:02.030 --> 00:01:06.980
 mudguard post and then 

00:01:04.040 --> 00:01:10.010
 guarantees maximum access aunt 

00:01:06.980 --> 00:01:15.050
 incriminated but we also have not 

00:01:10.010 --> 00:01:18.950
 understand what it is we save the operator yes 

00:01:15.050 --> 00:01:20.840
 accommodates on a suspension seat 

00:01:18.950 --> 00:01:23.600
 active semi-automatic with backrest 

00:01:20.840 --> 00:01:25.430
 ventilated the seat ends will adjust 

00:01:23.600 --> 00:01:27.320
 automatically based on the weight of 

00:01:25.430 --> 00:01:29.780
 operator and ventilated backrest 

00:01:27.320 --> 00:01:32.470
 always keeps your back dry 

00:01:29.780 --> 00:01:36.050
 of the operator say that condition 

00:01:32.470 --> 00:01:40.160
 on the left side console is located 

00:01:36.050 --> 00:01:42.500
 a refrigerated compartment wide enough 

00:01:40.160 --> 00:01:44.890
 continue to nike and one liter bottles 

00:01:42.500 --> 00:01:44.890
 and a half 

00:01:46.280 --> 00:01:51.140
 the newly designed cabin was 

00:01:48.860 --> 00:01:52.130
 realized thanks to the collaboration in 

00:01:51.140 --> 00:01:54.770
 design studios 

00:01:52.130 --> 00:01:56.210
 the interiors are clear but do not pose 

00:01:54.770 --> 00:01:58.310
 a problem and dirt because they are 

00:01:56.210 --> 00:02:00.409
 all washable materials and it was 

00:01:58.310 --> 00:02:02.420
 also used the soft touch material that 

00:02:00.409 --> 00:02:05.510
 it is the typical one used in the sector 

00:02:02.420 --> 00:02:07.550
 autonomous automotive the plant 

00:02:05.510 --> 00:02:11.709
 cabins always with 4 uprights now a 

00:02:07.550 --> 00:02:11.709
 hallmark is marco tractor 

00:02:11.710 --> 00:02:15.370
 the tractor is then managed a 

00:02:14.470 --> 00:02:18.160
 transmission engine level 

00:02:15.370 --> 00:02:21.160
 directly from the multi-function armrest 

00:02:18.160 --> 00:02:24.030
 which is equipped with a comfortable joystick 

00:02:21.160 --> 00:02:27.340
 ergonomic shape that does not cause fatigue 

00:02:24.030 --> 00:02:29.560
 the arm the hand an operator from 

00:02:27.340 --> 00:02:32.650
 joystick you can damage the commands 

00:02:29.560 --> 00:02:35.490
 regulate the passage of speeds le 

00:02:32.650 --> 00:02:37.840
 four gears that can also be 

00:02:35.490 --> 00:02:40.930
 automated then car passage 

00:02:37.840 --> 00:02:43.510
 powershift both by pressing the button on the 

00:02:40.930 --> 00:02:47.170
 armrest is through this 

00:02:43.510 --> 00:02:49.960
 regulator going to program on 

00:02:47.170 --> 00:02:51.730
 joystick the patented my sweet button 

00:02:49.960 --> 00:02:53.860
 a button that can be 

00:02:51.730 --> 00:02:56.650
 actually programmed to act 

00:02:53.860 --> 00:02:59.440
 from auto power shift or in the case 

00:02:56.650 --> 00:03:01.870
 differential or active valents 

00:02:59.440 --> 00:03:04.840
 several of the functions in succession not 

00:03:01.870 --> 00:03:08.410
 in succession but every day you can do that 

00:03:04.840 --> 00:03:10.870
 choose which command to activate ever 

00:03:08.410 --> 00:03:13.180
 matt switch four braised symbols 

00:03:10.870 --> 00:03:15.250
 with LEDs and illuminate what 

00:03:13.180 --> 00:03:18.430
 the operator himself will be selected for 

00:03:15.250 --> 00:03:20.770
 that day and to select it how you do it 

00:03:18.430 --> 00:03:24.340
 through this encoder a navigator 

00:03:20.770 --> 00:03:26.890
 that allows you but only to places and 

00:03:24.340 --> 00:03:29.350
 go select the function you will need 

00:03:26.890 --> 00:03:31.660
 play my sweet this has two 

00:03:29.350 --> 00:03:34.330
 advantages I reduce the number of buttons and 

00:03:31.660 --> 00:03:36.850
 joystick but I keep the same in a 

00:03:34.330 --> 00:03:39.040
 number of functions available and 

00:03:36.850 --> 00:03:41.350
 reduce the possibilities of activating in 

00:03:39.040 --> 00:03:44.130
 intentionally or by mistake 

00:03:41.350 --> 00:03:44.130
 functions that 

00:03:44.709 --> 00:03:50.739
 I didn't want to let it go anyway 

00:03:48.799 --> 00:03:53.510
 we also see the speech of the 

00:03:50.739 --> 00:03:56.060
 controls for hydraulics can have 

00:03:53.510 --> 00:03:57.920
 up to four distributors and in the case 

00:03:56.060 --> 00:03:59.720
 the front lift or less joystick 

00:03:57.920 --> 00:04:01.700
 to control the front lift 

00:03:59.720 --> 00:04:04.730
 where there will be a distributor for 

00:04:01.700 --> 00:04:07.400
 call the front senator plus a 

00:04:04.730 --> 00:04:10.329
 other movement that it puts into operation 

00:04:07.400 --> 00:04:12.560
 one always taken by additional help 

00:04:10.329 --> 00:04:14.690
 deployed on lift as it has 

00:04:12.560 --> 00:04:15.829
 supplemental electrical outlet is taken of 

00:04:14.690 --> 00:04:19.190
 inner strength taken by force 

00:04:15.829 --> 00:04:21.500
 rear with an automatic system for 

00:04:19.190 --> 00:04:23.780
 check lifter you can have 

00:04:21.500 --> 00:04:25.760
 the usual ones like the imposition for ming 

00:04:23.780 --> 00:04:27.289
 effort but then raise and lower the 

00:04:25.760 --> 00:04:29.300
 lifter can be made 

00:04:27.289 --> 00:04:30.830
 thanks to this rocker switch a 

00:04:29.300 --> 00:04:33.979
 special feature of this machine is that 

00:04:30.830 --> 00:04:37.360
 when I hold the shift button 

00:04:33.979 --> 00:04:41.300
 range that is here back to the joystick e 

00:04:37.360 --> 00:04:44.780
 ok holding it down and acting on 

00:04:41.300 --> 00:04:46.850
 marches I can change tie them ah here is ok 

00:04:44.780 --> 00:04:49.310
 when I hold it down and act on 

00:04:46.850 --> 00:04:52.460
 lift the function is to 

00:04:49.310 --> 00:04:54.320
 slow down the lift's stroke like this 

00:04:52.460 --> 00:04:55.610
 the suter to fish the tools without 

00:04:54.320 --> 00:04:58.520
 owe everyone 

00:04:55.610 --> 00:05:00.380
 with this the lens is kept slow 

00:04:58.520 --> 00:05:01.849
 and using ladies here are such areas 

00:05:00.380 --> 00:05:03.979
 the lifter sweeter movement 

00:05:01.849 --> 00:05:08.120
 when release it puts the button behind 

00:05:03.979 --> 00:05:08.510
 just use what the ride gets the most 

00:05:08.120 --> 00:05:10.970
 fast 

00:05:08.510 --> 00:05:13.669
 ok but so it's ab and then this one 

00:05:10.970 --> 00:05:17.570
 clearly we say similar finally 

00:05:13.669 --> 00:05:20.090
 let's say past I do so I get up and 

00:05:17.570 --> 00:05:21.560
 down so it raises but I also have the 

00:05:20.090 --> 00:05:23.389
 possibility of automatic function o 

00:05:21.560 --> 00:05:25.370
 which field then I can program in 

00:05:23.389 --> 00:05:27.470
 so that at the end of the field 

00:05:25.370 --> 00:05:28.430
 pressing the suppliers button in the 

00:05:27.470 --> 00:05:30.950
 functions 

00:05:28.430 --> 00:05:33.080
 originating and pre-registered positions 

00:05:30.950 --> 00:05:35.960
 as well as a cruise control for 

00:05:33.080 --> 00:05:39.500
 then lock the engine speed number 

00:05:35.960 --> 00:05:42.140
 four powershift gears for saw can 

00:05:39.500 --> 00:05:46.250
 ask you one more thing you've tried 

00:05:42.140 --> 00:05:48.760
 person when range stems like like 

00:05:46.250 --> 00:05:51.830
 the real stretch reacts the flight no 

00:05:48.760 --> 00:05:54.200
 because in the end young people thank you too 

00:05:51.830 --> 00:05:56.420
 zf technicians who supported us in the 

00:05:54.200 --> 00:05:58.910
 electronics development to find 

00:05:56.420 --> 00:06:00.380
 just an ideal compromise considering that 

00:05:58.910 --> 00:06:03.320
 this robotised gearbox is exclusive 

00:06:00.380 --> 00:06:04.910
 of tractor and has a very answer 

00:06:03.320 --> 00:06:07.400
 quick thanks to the fact that one 

00:06:04.910 --> 00:06:09.230
 orc electric control unit that governs the 

00:06:07.400 --> 00:06:11.870
 changed so it can be registered 

00:06:09.230 --> 00:06:14.720
 besides the fact that I can also decide 

00:06:11.870 --> 00:06:16.820
 to return and adjust the car function 

00:06:14.720 --> 00:06:19.040
 power shift for example this in the case 

00:06:16.820 --> 00:06:21.530
 of marches to get more or less 

00:06:19.040 --> 00:06:23.260
 greater or lesser aggressiveness depending on 

00:06:21.530 --> 00:06:26.840
 also of transport this transport 

00:06:23.260 --> 00:06:29.600
 ok else thing we 're going to develop 

00:06:26.840 --> 00:06:34.610
 it will then be an automated change of the 

00:06:29.600 --> 00:06:37.100
 same ranges perfect 

00:06:34.610 --> 00:06:40.310
 the only thing I wanted to ask you was the 

00:06:37.100 --> 00:06:43.610
 difference between this series and the counterpart 

00:06:40.310 --> 00:06:45.140
 landi and landini at engine level a 

00:06:43.610 --> 00:06:46.490
 engine level of the same that they were 

00:06:45.140 --> 00:06:48.740
 we embellish set-ups a little 

00:06:46.490 --> 00:06:51.200
 custom this is and on all 

00:06:48.740 --> 00:06:54.350
 series it was known the landini that 

00:06:51.200 --> 00:06:57.050
 are equivalent in seric 7.4 which 7.6 

00:06:54.350 --> 00:06:59.510
 mccormick since there is a more strategy 

00:06:57.050 --> 00:07:01.730
 geographical landini covers a given 

00:06:59.510 --> 00:07:03.980
 area of ​​the world I remember being created 

00:07:01.730 --> 00:07:05.870
 ok so they are managed 

00:07:03.980 --> 00:07:08.840
 set-ups the only thing I don't know if 

00:07:05.870 --> 00:07:12.980
 I asked you and the types of legs can 

00:07:08.840 --> 00:07:15.350
 send this series on March 4th to power 

00:07:12.980 --> 00:07:19.490
 shift for itself robotized ranges or 

00:07:15.350 --> 00:07:21.410
 in the case of the former 7.4 point you are at least i 

00:07:19.490 --> 00:07:23.450
 first two models of point 6 and the 

00:07:21.410 --> 00:07:24.980
 continuously variable transmission that 

00:07:23.450 --> 00:07:26.370
 we presented a world preview 

00:07:24.980 --> 00:07:29.750
 right here then 

00:07:26.370 --> 00:07:29.750
 let's get to the place
