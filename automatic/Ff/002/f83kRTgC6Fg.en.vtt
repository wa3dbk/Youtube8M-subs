00:02:37.580 --> 00:02:37.590 
anything about it absolutely at all but

00:02:37.590 --> 00:02:39.589 
anything about it absolutely at all but
I<00:02:37.980> really<00:02:38.430> liked<00:02:38.670> it<00:02:38.849> it's<00:02:39.329> a<00:02:39.420> very

00:02:39.589 --> 00:02:39.599 
I really liked it it's a very

00:02:39.599 --> 00:02:43.780 
I really liked it it's a very
action-packed<00:02:40.019> and<00:02:40.640> it's<00:02:41.640> about<00:02:42.120> a<00:02:42.480> dead

00:02:43.780 --> 00:02:43.790 
action-packed and it's about a dead

00:02:55.069 --> 00:02:55.079 
and he made his princess so it's about

00:02:55.079 --> 00:02:57.470 
and he made his princess so it's about
this<00:02:55.200> girl<00:02:55.500> who's<00:02:56.190> dead<00:02:56.489> and<00:02:56.730> fights<00:02:57.239> with
