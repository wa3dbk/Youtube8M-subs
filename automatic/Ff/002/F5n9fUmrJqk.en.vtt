 shoes and women this is a 

00:00:29.220 --> 00:00:32.130
 great love story 

00:00:30.269 --> 00:00:34.620
 the different types of shoes that 

00:00:32.130 --> 00:00:36.390
 we'll put away the most 

00:00:34.620 --> 00:00:37.620
 easy to put away these are obviously the 

00:00:36.390 --> 00:00:39.840
 heels shoes everyone 

00:00:37.620 --> 00:00:43.590
 knows this storage system with 

00:00:39.840 --> 00:00:45.780
 bars it can also be stored in 

00:00:43.590 --> 00:00:48.750
 cupboards specially made for 

00:00:45.780 --> 00:00:51.530
 shoes that it allows to put some 

00:00:48.750 --> 00:00:53.670
 a lot since this system there can be 

00:00:51.530 --> 00:00:55.770
 stacked you can put several 

00:00:53.670 --> 00:00:58.079
 authors like that of two bars that's 

00:00:55.770 --> 00:01:00.090
 quite practical difficult to put away this 

00:00:58.079 --> 00:01:01.890
 are the ballerinas and the shoes 

00:01:00.090 --> 00:01:04.140
 offset that have been raging since 

00:01:01.890 --> 00:01:06.420
 a few years in general all these 

00:01:04.140 --> 00:01:09.030
 shoes there end up at the bottom of 

00:01:06.420 --> 00:01:11.760
 closet lay on top of each other 

00:01:09.030 --> 00:01:14.220
 and first it's the abyss and then 

00:01:11.760 --> 00:01:16.590
 it's hard to find 

00:01:14.220 --> 00:01:18.750
 find the pair a way is easy 

00:01:16.590 --> 00:01:20.790
 to put them away without taking place 

00:01:18.750 --> 00:01:22.259
 the little lockers arrangements that get 

00:01:20.790 --> 00:01:24.299
 hang on the rods like those 

00:01:22.259 --> 00:01:25.740
 these are small lockers 

00:01:24.299 --> 00:01:27.450
 arrangements that we find absolutely 

00:01:25.740 --> 00:01:29.850
 everywhere that cling to 

00:01:27.450 --> 00:01:33.450
 rods so it's easy to install 

00:01:29.850 --> 00:01:35.430
 no need for DIY and its 

00:01:33.450 --> 00:01:39.270
 shoes there that usually 

00:01:35.430 --> 00:01:40.770
 are mistreated there each have their 

00:01:39.270 --> 00:01:45.900
 small boxes so it does not spoil 

00:01:40.770 --> 00:01:48.390
 and this is the most convenient way to 

00:01:45.900 --> 00:01:49.530
 the ballerinas as compensate for 

00:01:48.390 --> 00:01:52.170
 shoes that do not take 

00:01:49.530 --> 00:01:54.660
 place of the foot type or sandals you 

00:01:52.170 --> 00:01:57.270
 can even put two pairs in the 

00:01:54.660 --> 00:02:00.810
 same little trap by putting them in the head 

00:01:57.270 --> 00:02:03.360
 always spade and then you put in 

00:02:00.810 --> 00:02:05.430
 father in a locker 

00:02:03.360 --> 00:02:08.610
 if you really have a lot of fathers 

00:02:05.430 --> 00:02:10.679
 they are not damaged like that and it's 

00:02:08.610 --> 00:02:13.140
 space saving and for those who have 

00:02:10.679 --> 00:02:15.690
 really a lot of shoes remains 

00:02:13.140 --> 00:02:18.780
 always the solution of the magic box 

00:02:15.690 --> 00:02:21.480
 that we slide under the orange bed and the 

00:02:18.780 --> 00:02:23.670
 obviously too much in this case there 

00:02:21.480 --> 00:02:24.060
 put away the one you wear the least 

00:02:23.670 --> 00:02:27.470
 often 

00:02:24.060 --> 00:02:27.470
 Your turn now
