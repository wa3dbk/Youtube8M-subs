automatic high damage high recoil
assault<00:00:27.119> rifle<00:00:27.510> and<00:00:27.810> what<00:00:28.050> I<00:00:28.080> mean<00:00:28.260> by<00:00:28.320> that<00:00:28.590> is

00:00:28.820 --> 00:00:28.830 
assault rifle and what I mean by that is

00:00:28.830 --> 00:00:32.060 
assault rifle and what I mean by that is
first<00:00:29.519> it's<00:00:29.880> damage<00:00:30.330> it<00:00:30.570> does<00:00:30.960> 45<00:00:31.529> maximum

00:00:32.060 --> 00:00:32.070 
first it's damage it does 45 maximum

00:00:32.070 --> 00:00:35.720 
first it's damage it does 45 maximum
damage<00:00:32.250> up<00:00:32.669> to<00:00:33.090> 39<00:00:33.809> meters<00:00:34.260> roughly<00:00:34.980> so<00:00:35.550> that's

00:00:35.720 --> 00:00:35.730 
damage up to 39 meters roughly so that's

00:00:35.730 --> 00:00:37.250 
damage up to 39 meters roughly so that's
really<00:00:35.940> where<00:00:36.149> most<00:00:36.329> of<00:00:36.540> your<00:00:36.630> engagements

00:00:37.250 --> 00:00:37.260 
really where most of your engagements

00:00:37.260 --> 00:00:40.040 
really where most of your engagements
are<00:00:37.350> going<00:00:37.559> to<00:00:37.680> be<00:00:37.829> now<00:00:38.670> pass<00:00:38.940> that<00:00:39.210> to<00:00:39.480> 69

00:00:40.040 --> 00:00:40.050 
are going to be now pass that to 69

00:00:40.050 --> 00:00:42.500 
are going to be now pass that to 69
metres<00:00:40.290> it<00:00:40.559> does<00:00:41.010> 33<00:00:41.550> damage<00:00:41.850> making<00:00:42.059> it<00:00:42.300> a

00:00:42.500 --> 00:00:42.510 
metres it does 33 damage making it a

00:00:42.510 --> 00:00:44.690 
metres it does 33 damage making it a
four-shot<00:00:43.350> kill<00:00:43.590> now<00:00:44.219> that's<00:00:44.399> pretty<00:00:44.579> much

00:00:44.690 --> 00:00:44.700 
four-shot kill now that's pretty much

00:00:44.700 --> 00:00:47.510 
four-shot kill now that's pretty much
where<00:00:44.969> all<00:00:45.750> maybe<00:00:46.440> ninety<00:00:46.829> nine<00:00:46.950> percent<00:00:47.129> of

00:00:47.510 --> 00:00:47.520 
where all maybe ninety nine percent of

00:00:47.520 --> 00:00:49.639 
where all maybe ninety nine percent of
engagements<00:00:48.480> in<00:00:48.600> call<00:00:48.840> of<00:00:48.870> duty<00:00:48.960> are<00:00:49.260> gonna<00:00:49.440> be

00:00:49.639 --> 00:00:49.649 
engagements in call of duty are gonna be

00:00:49.649 --> 00:00:52.040 
engagements in call of duty are gonna be
in<00:00:49.829> like<00:00:50.250> that<00:00:50.399> zone<00:00:50.730> and<00:00:50.969> really<00:00:51.420> pass<00:00:51.719> that

00:00:52.040 --> 00:00:52.050 
in like that zone and really pass that

00:00:52.050 --> 00:00:55.819 
in like that zone and really pass that
zone<00:00:52.379> until<00:00:53.070> infinity<00:00:53.430> it<00:00:54.210> does<00:00:54.629> 24<00:00:55.440> damage

00:00:55.819 --> 00:00:55.829 
zone until infinity it does 24 damage

00:00:55.829 --> 00:00:58.040 
zone until infinity it does 24 damage
making<00:00:56.399> a<00:00:56.460> five<00:00:56.730> shot<00:00:56.760> kill<00:00:57.210> and<00:00:57.420> really

00:00:58.040 --> 00:00:58.050 
making a five shot kill and really

00:00:58.050 --> 00:01:01.910 
making a five shot kill and really
passed<00:00:59.039> into<00:00:59.969> the<00:01:00.180> 33<00:01:00.809> damage<00:01:01.140> zone<00:01:01.350> where

00:01:01.910 --> 00:01:01.920 
passed into the 33 damage zone where

00:01:01.920 --> 00:01:03.410 
passed into the 33 damage zone where
you're<00:01:02.129> where<00:01:02.460> you're<00:01:02.550> doing<00:01:02.730> four<00:01:03.000> shots<00:01:03.239> to

00:01:03.410 --> 00:01:03.420 
you're where you're doing four shots to

00:01:03.420 --> 00:01:05.179 
you're where you're doing four shots to
kill<00:01:03.600> it<00:01:03.840> can<00:01:04.199> be<00:01:04.290> very<00:01:04.350> difficult<00:01:04.680> for<00:01:04.979> you

00:01:05.179 --> 00:01:05.189 
kill it can be very difficult for you

00:01:05.189 --> 00:01:07.850 
kill it can be very difficult for you
because<00:01:05.760> the<00:01:05.880> scar-h<00:01:06.180> as<00:01:06.510> high<00:01:06.750> recoil<00:01:07.380> which

00:01:07.850 --> 00:01:07.860 
because the scar-h as high recoil which

00:01:07.860 --> 00:01:09.679 
because the scar-h as high recoil which
makes<00:01:08.070> it<00:01:08.159> a<00:01:08.250> very<00:01:08.280> undesirable<00:01:08.909> assault

00:01:09.679 --> 00:01:09.689 
makes it a very undesirable assault

00:01:09.689 --> 00:01:12.109 
makes it a very undesirable assault
rifle<00:01:10.020> for<00:01:10.140> some<00:01:10.350> people<00:01:10.740> and<00:01:11.060> even<00:01:12.060> though

00:01:12.109 --> 00:01:12.119 
rifle for some people and even though

00:01:12.119 --> 00:01:14.000 
rifle for some people and even though
does<00:01:12.299> for<00:01:12.600> shot<00:01:12.810> kills<00:01:13.200> like<00:01:13.560> a<00:01:13.590> lot<00:01:13.799> of<00:01:13.890> other

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:14.010 
does for shot kills like a lot of other

00:01:14.010 --> 00:01:15.740 
does for shot kills like a lot of other
assault<00:01:14.369> rifle<00:01:14.700> there's<00:01:15.090> some<00:01:15.360> us<00:01:15.479> all<00:01:15.630> rise

00:01:15.740 --> 00:01:15.750 
assault rifle there's some us all rise

00:01:15.750 --> 00:01:18.109 
assault rifle there's some us all rise
for<00:01:15.780> example<00:01:16.259> type<00:01:16.500> 25<00:01:17.159> which<00:01:17.820> has<00:01:18.000> very

00:01:18.109 --> 00:01:18.119 
for example type 25 which has very

00:01:18.119 --> 00:01:21.890 
for example type 25 which has very
little<00:01:18.509> recoil<00:01:19.020> compared<00:01:19.710> to<00:01:19.860> the<00:01:20.130> scar-h<00:01:20.970> so

00:01:21.890 --> 00:01:21.900 
little recoil compared to the scar-h so

00:01:21.900 --> 00:01:23.480 
little recoil compared to the scar-h so
that's<00:01:22.380> why<00:01:22.560> make<00:01:22.830> it<00:01:22.920> will<00:01:23.100> look<00:01:23.250> down<00:01:23.430> on

00:01:23.480 --> 00:01:23.490 
that's why make it will look down on

00:01:23.490 --> 00:01:25.789 
that's why make it will look down on
this<00:01:23.790> assault<00:01:24.119> rifle<00:01:24.570> and<00:01:24.750> since<00:01:25.590> as<00:01:25.770> a

00:01:25.789 --> 00:01:25.799 
this assault rifle and since as a

00:01:25.799 --> 00:01:27.350 
this assault rifle and since as a
session<00:01:26.189> high<00:01:26.220> recoil<00:01:26.729> can<00:01:26.970> be<00:01:27.090> harder<00:01:27.330> to

00:01:27.350 --> 00:01:27.360 
session high recoil can be harder to

00:01:27.360 --> 00:01:29.960 
session high recoil can be harder to
kill<00:01:27.540> people<00:01:27.659> at<00:01:28.080> higher<00:01:28.710> ranges<00:01:29.130> and<00:01:29.340> also

00:01:29.960 --> 00:01:29.970 
kill people at higher ranges and also

00:01:29.970 --> 00:01:33.200 
kill people at higher ranges and also
that<00:01:30.270> makes<00:01:30.479> the<00:01:30.960> scar-h<00:01:31.970> undesirable<00:01:32.970> some

00:01:33.200 --> 00:01:33.210 
that makes the scar-h undesirable some

00:01:33.210 --> 00:01:36.710 
that makes the scar-h undesirable some
people<00:01:33.509> because<00:01:33.780> it<00:01:33.810> has<00:01:34.110> a<00:01:34.700> 625<00:01:35.700> rounds<00:01:36.600> per

00:01:36.710 --> 00:01:36.720 
people because it has a 625 rounds per

00:01:36.720 --> 00:01:39.140 
people because it has a 625 rounds per
minute<00:01:36.840> fire<00:01:37.170> rate<00:01:37.409> and<00:01:38.189> that's<00:01:38.400> slow<00:01:38.700> to<00:01:39.090> be

00:01:39.140 --> 00:01:39.150 
minute fire rate and that's slow to be

00:01:39.150 --> 00:01:40.819 
minute fire rate and that's slow to be
honest<00:01:39.360> that's<00:01:39.479> very<00:01:39.720> soft<00:01:40.049> compared<00:01:40.500> to<00:01:40.680> the

00:01:40.819 --> 00:01:40.829 
honest that's very soft compared to the

00:01:40.829 --> 00:01:43.999 
honest that's very soft compared to the
type<00:01:41.009> 25<00:01:41.130> again<00:01:41.610> which<00:01:42.390> has<00:01:42.689> a<00:01:42.720> fiery<00:01:43.079> up<00:01:43.320> 900

00:01:43.999 --> 00:01:44.009 
type 25 again which has a fiery up 900

00:01:44.009 --> 00:01:45.469 
type 25 again which has a fiery up 900
rounds<00:01:44.130> per<00:01:44.310> minute<00:01:44.369> this<00:01:44.729> is<00:01:44.880> a<00:01:44.939> slow<00:01:45.240> fire

00:01:45.469 --> 00:01:45.479 
rounds per minute this is a slow fire

00:01:45.479 --> 00:01:47.480 
rounds per minute this is a slow fire
rate<00:01:45.540> the<00:01:46.170> only<00:01:46.409> thing<00:01:46.560> is<00:01:46.590> slower<00:01:46.890> than<00:01:47.280> that

00:01:47.480 --> 00:01:47.490 
rate the only thing is slower than that

00:01:47.490 --> 00:01:51.590 
rate the only thing is slower than that
is<00:01:47.640> the<00:01:48.090> full<00:01:48.659> auto<00:01:48.930> attachment<00:01:49.560> on<00:01:49.649> the<00:01:50.390> FN<00:01:51.390> at

00:01:51.590 --> 00:01:51.600 
is the full auto attachment on the FN at

00:01:51.600 --> 00:01:55.310 
is the full auto attachment on the FN at
the<00:01:51.869> FAL<00:01:52.560> osw<00:01:52.909> and<00:01:53.909> the<00:01:54.060> SMR<00:01:54.630> but<00:01:55.140> that's

00:01:55.310 --> 00:01:55.320 
the FAL osw and the SMR but that's

00:01:55.320 --> 00:01:57.020 
the FAL osw and the SMR but that's
because<00:01:55.500> they're<00:01:55.770> very<00:01:56.040> high<00:01:56.250> def<00:01:56.520> damage

00:01:57.020 --> 00:01:57.030 
because they're very high def damage

00:01:57.030 --> 00:02:00.620 
because they're very high def damage
assault<00:01:57.600> rifles<00:01:58.159> so<00:01:59.159> because<00:02:00.060> of<00:02:00.090> this<00:02:00.270> high

00:02:00.620 --> 00:02:00.630 
assault rifles so because of this high

00:02:00.630 --> 00:02:02.899 
assault rifles so because of this high
damage<00:02:00.899> he<00:02:01.380> needs<00:02:01.649> to<00:02:01.740> have<00:02:01.860> a<00:02:01.890> good<00:02:02.219> magazine
