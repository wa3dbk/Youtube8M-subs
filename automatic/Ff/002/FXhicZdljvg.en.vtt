00:01:07.160 --> 00:01:07.170 
interested in what I did here I

00:01:07.170 --> 00:01:11.249 
interested in what I did here I
redirected<00:01:08.170> the<00:01:08.320> exhaust<00:01:09.070> system<00:01:09.400> here<00:01:10.259> this

00:01:11.249 --> 00:01:11.259 
redirected the exhaust system here this

00:01:11.259 --> 00:01:13.950 
redirected the exhaust system here this
is<00:01:11.440> a<00:01:11.470> new<00:01:11.710> exhaust<00:01:12.190> pipe<00:01:12.490> that<00:01:12.729> I<00:01:12.960> had

00:01:13.950 --> 00:01:13.960 
is a new exhaust pipe that I had

00:01:13.960 --> 00:01:19.499 
is a new exhaust pipe that I had
measured<00:01:14.380> out<00:01:14.530> and<00:01:14.890> had<00:01:15.100> bent<00:01:15.400> up<00:01:15.670> I<00:01:18.509> didn't

00:01:19.499 --> 00:01:19.509 
measured out and had bent up I didn't

00:01:19.509 --> 00:01:22.020 
measured out and had bent up I didn't
like<00:01:19.660> the<00:01:19.900> old<00:01:20.100> exhaust<00:01:21.100> the<00:01:21.400> way<00:01:21.520> they<00:01:21.670> had<00:01:21.850> it

00:01:22.020 --> 00:01:22.030 
like the old exhaust the way they had it

00:01:22.030 --> 00:01:23.910 
like the old exhaust the way they had it
because<00:01:22.750> they<00:01:22.840> had<00:01:22.990> to<00:01:23.110> come<00:01:23.289> straight<00:01:23.530> down

00:01:23.910 --> 00:01:23.920 
because they had to come straight down

00:01:23.920 --> 00:01:26.900 
because they had to come straight down
and<00:01:24.310> then<00:01:25.180> exhausted<00:01:25.810> out<00:01:25.899> toward<00:01:26.170> the<00:01:26.289> front

00:01:26.900 --> 00:01:26.910 
and then exhausted out toward the front

00:01:26.910 --> 00:01:30.420 
and then exhausted out toward the front
and<00:01:27.910> as<00:01:28.690> you<00:01:29.050> go<00:01:29.200> forward<00:01:29.770> the<00:01:29.920> exhaust<00:01:30.220> comes

00:01:30.420 --> 00:01:30.430 
and as you go forward the exhaust comes

00:01:30.430 --> 00:01:34.620 
and as you go forward the exhaust comes
back<00:01:30.700> to<00:01:30.880> you<00:01:31.000> in<00:01:31.210> the<00:01:31.509> face<00:01:31.720> and<00:01:32.649> also<00:01:33.630> the

00:01:34.620 --> 00:01:34.630 
back to you in the face and also the

back to you in the face and also the
exhaust<00:01:34.960> haven't<00:01:35.649> was<00:01:36.640> pointing<00:01:37.090> down<00:01:37.300> to<00:01:37.479> the

00:01:37.560 --> 00:01:37.570 
exhaust haven't was pointing down to the

00:01:37.570 --> 00:01:40.290 
exhaust haven't was pointing down to the
ground<00:01:37.979> it<00:01:38.979> would<00:01:39.130> blow<00:01:39.520> up<00:01:39.640> all<00:01:39.850> the<00:01:40.030> dirt<00:01:40.270> and

00:01:40.290 --> 00:01:40.300 
ground it would blow up all the dirt and

00:01:40.300 --> 00:01:43.800 
ground it would blow up all the dirt and
the<00:01:40.450> dust<00:01:40.509> in<00:01:40.899> my<00:01:41.020> face<00:01:41.259> tanned<00:01:41.820> and<00:01:42.820> up<00:01:43.479> inside

00:01:43.800 --> 00:01:43.810 
the dust in my face tanned and up inside

00:01:43.810 --> 00:01:46.620 
the dust in my face tanned and up inside
the<00:01:43.930> tractor<00:01:44.380> and<00:01:44.470> all<00:01:44.619> that<00:01:44.830> so<00:01:45.759> that<00:01:46.090> was<00:01:46.300> I

00:01:46.620 --> 00:01:46.630 
the tractor and all that so that was I

00:01:46.630 --> 00:01:49.680 
the tractor and all that so that was I
didn't<00:01:47.590> like<00:01:47.770> that<00:01:47.979> so<00:01:48.340> I<00:01:48.550> had<00:01:49.300> this<00:01:49.479> other

00:01:49.680 --> 00:01:49.690 
didn't like that so I had this other

00:01:49.690 --> 00:01:53.760 
didn't like that so I had this other
pipe<00:01:50.050> made<00:01:50.350> up<00:01:50.590> and<00:01:51.899> exhaust<00:01:52.899> out<00:01:53.140> to<00:01:53.350> the<00:01:53.470> side

00:01:53.760 --> 00:01:53.770 
pipe made up and exhaust out to the side

00:01:53.770 --> 00:02:00.330 
pipe made up and exhaust out to the side
as<00:01:54.520> you<00:01:54.790> can<00:01:54.820> see<00:01:58.110> my<00:01:59.110> second<00:01:59.560> plan<00:01:59.770> was<00:02:00.070> to<00:02:00.220> go

00:02:00.330 --> 00:02:00.340 
as you can see my second plan was to go

00:02:00.340 --> 00:02:03.359 
as you can see my second plan was to go
vertical<00:02:00.850> to<00:02:00.880> go<00:02:01.090> up<00:02:01.240> through<00:02:01.479> the<00:02:01.570> hood<00:02:02.310> but<00:02:03.310> I

00:02:03.359 --> 00:02:03.369 
vertical to go up through the hood but I

00:02:03.369 --> 00:02:05.700 
vertical to go up through the hood but I
don't<00:02:03.970> think<00:02:04.210> for<00:02:04.540> now<00:02:04.630> I'm<00:02:04.840> gonna<00:02:05.020> do<00:02:05.259> that<00:02:05.439> I

00:02:05.700 --> 00:02:05.710 
don't think for now I'm gonna do that I

00:02:05.710 --> 00:02:10.080
