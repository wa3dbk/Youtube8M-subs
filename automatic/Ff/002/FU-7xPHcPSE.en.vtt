Guardian Maximus now what does it do the

00:00:20.160 --> 00:00:21.980 
Guardian Maximus now what does it do the
guardian<00:00:20.460> maximus<00:00:20.910> is<00:00:20.939> actually<00:00:21.390> read<00:00:21.660> one

00:00:21.980 --> 00:00:21.990 
guardian maximus is actually read one

00:00:21.990 --> 00:00:23.660 
guardian maximus is actually read one
built<00:00:22.289> into<00:00:22.529> an<00:00:22.650> enclosure<00:00:22.949> with<00:00:23.250> two<00:00:23.400> hard

00:00:23.660 --> 00:00:23.670 
built into an enclosure with two hard

00:00:23.670 --> 00:00:26.029 
built into an enclosure with two hard
drives<00:00:23.820> so<00:00:24.810> it<00:00:24.930> basically<00:00:25.080> means<00:00:25.410> is<00:00:25.560> raid<00:00:25.800> one

00:00:26.029 --> 00:00:26.039 
drives so it basically means is raid one

00:00:26.039 --> 00:00:27.529 
drives so it basically means is raid one
is<00:00:26.160> very<00:00:26.430> done<00:00:26.609> in<00:00:26.730> C<00:00:26.910> so<00:00:27.060> whatever<00:00:27.330> is<00:00:27.420> written

00:00:27.529 --> 00:00:27.539 
is very done in C so whatever is written

00:00:27.539 --> 00:00:29.540 
is very done in C so whatever is written
to<00:00:27.689> one<00:00:27.960> hard<00:00:28.199> drive<00:00:28.439> is<00:00:28.710> written<00:00:29.160> to<00:00:29.189> another

00:00:29.540 --> 00:00:29.550 
to one hard drive is written to another

00:00:29.550 --> 00:00:31.550 
to one hard drive is written to another
hard<00:00:29.789> drive<00:00:29.970> in<00:00:30.269> this<00:00:30.779> one<00:00:30.990> little<00:00:31.140> enclosure

00:00:31.550 --> 00:00:31.560 
hard drive in this one little enclosure

00:00:31.560 --> 00:00:34.430 
hard drive in this one little enclosure
that<00:00:31.710> I<00:00:31.859> have<00:00:32.099> basically<00:00:32.820> right<00:00:33.120> here<00:00:33.440> so

00:00:34.430 --> 00:00:34.440 
that I have basically right here so

00:00:34.440 --> 00:00:35.900 
that I have basically right here so
which<00:00:34.829> means<00:00:35.040> you<00:00:35.130> ever<00:00:35.280> done<00:00:35.520> and<00:00:35.670> seen<00:00:35.820> your

00:00:35.900 --> 00:00:35.910 
which means you ever done and seen your

00:00:35.910 --> 00:00:37.250 
which means you ever done and seen your
backup<00:00:36.329> so<00:00:36.450> which<00:00:36.600> means<00:00:36.809> if<00:00:36.960> one<00:00:37.110> of<00:00:37.200> the

00:00:37.250 --> 00:00:37.260 
backup so which means if one of the

00:00:37.260 --> 00:00:39.680 
backup so which means if one of the
drives<00:00:37.530> fails<00:00:37.950> your<00:00:38.910> data<00:00:39.420> is<00:00:39.540> actually

00:00:39.680 --> 00:00:39.690 
drives fails your data is actually

00:00:39.690 --> 00:00:41.330 
drives fails your data is actually
redundantly<00:00:40.230> backed<00:00:40.469> up<00:00:40.649> the<00:00:40.770> bolt<00:00:40.980> drives

00:00:41.330 --> 00:00:41.340 
redundantly backed up the bolt drives

00:00:41.340 --> 00:00:43.369 
redundantly backed up the bolt drives
it's<00:00:41.579> a<00:00:41.700> mirrored<00:00:42.120> fashion<00:00:42.930> which<00:00:43.050> is<00:00:43.079> raid

00:00:43.369 --> 00:00:43.379 
it's a mirrored fashion which is raid

00:00:43.379 --> 00:00:45.619 
it's a mirrored fashion which is raid
one<00:00:43.710> so<00:00:44.219> whatever<00:00:44.760> you're<00:00:45.000> putting<00:00:45.120> on<00:00:45.270> one<00:00:45.480> is

00:00:45.619 --> 00:00:45.629 
one so whatever you're putting on one is

00:00:45.629 --> 00:00:47.810 
one so whatever you're putting on one is
written<00:00:45.840> to<00:00:45.930> the<00:00:46.020> other<00:00:46.170> and<00:00:46.469> if<00:00:47.039> it<00:00:47.219> wonder<00:00:47.550> if

00:00:47.810 --> 00:00:47.820 
written to the other and if it wonder if

00:00:47.820 --> 00:00:49.700 
written to the other and if it wonder if
one<00:00:48.510> of<00:00:48.539> those<00:00:48.660> drives<00:00:48.930> happens<00:00:49.320> to<00:00:49.440> fail

00:00:49.700 --> 00:00:49.710 
one of those drives happens to fail

00:00:49.710 --> 00:00:51.830 
one of those drives happens to fail
later<00:00:50.640> on<00:00:50.820> down<00:00:51.030> the<00:00:51.090> line<00:00:51.210> it's<00:00:51.570> actually

00:00:51.830 --> 00:00:51.840 
later on down the line it's actually

00:00:51.840 --> 00:00:53.240 
later on down the line it's actually
pretty<00:00:52.050> easy<00:00:52.170> you<00:00:52.590> just<00:00:52.620> pop<00:00:52.980> out<00:00:53.190> the

00:00:53.240 --> 00:00:53.250 
pretty easy you just pop out the

00:00:53.250 --> 00:00:55.549 
pretty easy you just pop out the
existing<00:00:53.820> drive<00:00:54.059> that<00:00:54.300> failed<00:00:54.600> pop<00:00:55.140> in<00:00:55.350> a<00:00:55.410> new

00:00:55.549 --> 00:00:55.559 
existing drive that failed pop in a new

00:00:55.559 --> 00:00:58.040 
existing drive that failed pop in a new
drive<00:00:55.860> and<00:00:56.070> reformat<00:00:56.730> it<00:00:56.760> and<00:00:57.059> rebuild<00:00:57.750> the

00:00:58.040 --> 00:00:58.050 
drive and reformat it and rebuild the

00:00:58.050 --> 00:01:00.889 
drive and reformat it and rebuild the
raid<00:00:58.620> 1<00:00:58.969> rated<00:00:59.969> which<00:01:00.090> means<00:01:00.359> that<00:01:00.510> everything

00:01:00.889 --> 00:01:00.899 
raid 1 rated which means that everything

00:01:00.899 --> 00:01:02.510 
raid 1 rated which means that everything
will<00:01:01.170> be<00:01:01.230> redundantly<00:01:01.800> backed<00:01:02.039> up<00:01:02.219> once<00:01:02.399> again

00:01:02.510 --> 00:01:02.520 
will be redundantly backed up once again

00:01:02.520 --> 00:01:04.549 
will be redundantly backed up once again
so<00:01:03.239> which<00:01:03.420> basically<00:01:03.660> means<00:01:03.930> is<00:01:04.140> that<00:01:04.170> if<00:01:04.439> one

00:01:04.549 --> 00:01:04.559 
so which basically means is that if one

00:01:04.559 --> 00:01:06.469 
so which basically means is that if one
drive<00:01:04.769> fails<00:01:05.040> you<00:01:05.880> always<00:01:06.090> have<00:01:06.210> your<00:01:06.240> bit

00:01:06.469 --> 00:01:06.479 
drive fails you always have your bit

00:01:06.479 --> 00:01:08.719 
drive fails you always have your bit
data<00:01:06.720> to<00:01:06.900> back<00:01:07.080> up<00:01:07.189> from<00:01:08.189> that<00:01:08.310> secondary

00:01:08.719 --> 00:01:08.729 
data to back up from that secondary

00:01:08.729 --> 00:01:11.179 
data to back up from that secondary
drive<00:01:09.090> now<00:01:10.049> hardware<00:01:10.470> wise<00:01:10.590> this<00:01:10.890> thing<00:01:11.070> is

00:01:11.179 --> 00:01:11.189 
drive now hardware wise this thing is

00:01:11.189 --> 00:01:12.770 
drive now hardware wise this thing is
pretty<00:01:11.520> nice<00:01:11.729> as<00:01:11.939> you<00:01:12.060> guys<00:01:12.180> can<00:01:12.330> see<00:01:12.390> from<00:01:12.630> the

drive number two and rebuild and of

00:01:26.670 --> 00:01:28.249 
drive number two and rebuild and of
course<00:01:26.880> these<00:01:27.090> lights<00:01:27.360> light<00:01:27.689> up<00:01:27.720> as<00:01:28.080> the

00:01:28.249 --> 00:01:28.259 
course these lights light up as the

00:01:28.259 --> 00:01:30.140 
course these lights light up as the
drives<00:01:28.530> are<00:01:28.740> being<00:01:29.009> used<00:01:29.280> and<00:01:29.549> written<00:01:29.850> to<00:01:30.000> and

00:01:30.150 --> 00:01:32.450 
drives are being used and written to and
read<00:01:30.329> from<00:01:30.630> so<00:01:31.409> which<00:01:31.710> basically<00:01:31.979> means<00:01:32.250> it

00:01:32.450 --> 00:01:32.460 
read from so which basically means it

the mac pro is kind of like a little
half<00:02:33.140> loop<00:02:33.440> so<00:02:34.310> it<00:02:34.430> sits<00:02:34.670> on<00:02:34.849> those<00:02:35.030> feet<00:02:35.330> as

00:02:35.470 --> 00:02:35.480 
half loop so it sits on those feet as

00:02:35.480 --> 00:02:36.910 
half loop so it sits on those feet as
you<00:02:35.959> guys<00:02:36.080> can<00:02:36.230> see<00:02:36.290> right<00:02:36.530> below<00:02:36.739> it<00:02:36.769> there's

you guys can see right below it there's

00:02:36.920 --> 00:02:38.979 
you guys can see right below it there's
actually<00:02:37.250> four<00:02:37.489> screws<00:02:37.910> in<00:02:38.090> it<00:02:38.150> you<00:02:38.690> would<00:02:38.780> pop

00:02:38.979 --> 00:02:38.989 
actually four screws in it you would pop

00:02:38.989 --> 00:02:40.570 
actually four screws in it you would pop
out<00:02:39.140> those<00:02:39.349> four<00:02:39.560> screws<00:02:39.920> and<00:02:40.160> the<00:02:40.220> Frog<00:02:40.430> the

00:02:40.570 --> 00:02:40.580 
out those four screws and the Frog the

00:02:40.580 --> 00:02:42.699 
out those four screws and the Frog the
enclosure<00:02:40.879> actually<00:02:41.360> pops<00:02:41.630> out<00:02:41.870> of<00:02:41.900> it<00:02:42.140> so<00:02:42.620> you

00:02:42.699 --> 00:02:42.709 
enclosure actually pops out of it so you

00:02:42.709 --> 00:02:44.259 
enclosure actually pops out of it so you
can<00:02:42.860> basically<00:02:43.370> rip<00:02:43.700> the<00:02:43.819> drive<00:02:44.030> right<00:02:44.239> out

00:02:44.259 --> 00:02:44.269 
can basically rip the drive right out

00:02:44.269 --> 00:02:46.809 
can basically rip the drive right out
and<00:02:44.480> put<00:02:44.599> the<00:02:44.690> new<00:02:44.780> one<00:02:44.959> in<00:02:45.160> no<00:02:46.160> problem<00:02:46.670> I

00:02:46.809 --> 00:02:46.819 
and put the new one in no problem I

00:02:46.819 --> 00:02:48.699 
and put the new one in no problem I
haven't<00:02:47.450> done<00:02:47.569> that<00:02:47.630> yet<00:02:47.810> haven't<00:02:48.349> had<00:02:48.470> to<00:02:48.590> do

month but I would say if one of the

00:02:52.489 --> 00:02:53.740 
month but I would say if one of the
driest<00:02:52.670> fails<00:02:52.940> it<00:02:53.090> looks<00:02:53.239> to<00:02:53.329> be<00:02:53.420> pretty<00:02:53.450> easy

00:02:53.740 --> 00:02:53.750 
driest fails it looks to be pretty easy

00:02:53.750 --> 00:02:56.020 
driest fails it looks to be pretty easy
and<00:02:54.319> if<00:02:54.620> it<00:02:54.739> out<00:02:54.890> and<00:02:55.190> then<00:02:55.400> if<00:02:55.519> that<00:02:55.670> ever<00:02:55.819> does

happen I will make sure to give you guys
a<00:02:57.530> video<00:02:57.799> on<00:02:58.160> how<00:02:58.190> to<00:02:58.700> replace<00:02:59.180> a<00:02:59.450> blown<00:02:59.840> drive

00:03:00.280 --> 00:03:00.290 
a video on how to replace a blown drive

00:03:00.290 --> 00:03:02.470 
a video on how to replace a blown drive
in<00:03:00.709> your<00:03:00.920> enclosure<00:03:01.310> but<00:03:02.209> I<00:03:02.269> hope<00:03:02.420> that

00:03:02.470 --> 00:03:02.480 
in your enclosure but I hope that

00:03:02.480 --> 00:03:04.210 
in your enclosure but I hope that
doesn't<00:03:02.660> have<00:03:02.900> any<00:03:03.049> time<00:03:03.230> soon<00:03:03.500> and<00:03:03.920> if<00:03:04.190> it

00:03:04.210 --> 00:03:04.220 
doesn't have any time soon and if it

00:03:04.220 --> 00:03:06.309 
doesn't have any time soon and if it
does<00:03:04.370> I<00:03:04.579> will<00:03:04.640> give<00:03:04.879> you<00:03:04.970> guys<00:03:05.090> a<00:03:05.120> video<00:03:05.390> but

00:03:06.309 --> 00:03:06.319 
does I will give you guys a video but

00:03:06.319 --> 00:03:07.509 
does I will give you guys a video but
anyways<00:03:06.650> what<00:03:06.799> are<00:03:06.829> my<00:03:06.980> thoughts<00:03:07.010> on<00:03:07.400> this

00:03:07.509 --> 00:03:07.519 
anyways what are my thoughts on this

00:03:07.519 --> 00:03:09.789 
anyways what are my thoughts on this
enclosure<00:03:07.819> well<00:03:08.120> you<00:03:08.629> know<00:03:08.750> using<00:03:09.349> it<00:03:09.620> it's

00:03:09.789 --> 00:03:09.799 
enclosure well you know using it it's

00:03:09.799 --> 00:03:11.410 
enclosure well you know using it it's
been<00:03:09.980> extraordinarily<00:03:10.610> good<00:03:11.150> especially

00:03:11.410 --> 00:03:11.420 
been extraordinarily good especially

00:03:11.420 --> 00:03:13.390 
been extraordinarily good especially
with<00:03:11.660> that<00:03:11.690> USB<00:03:12.079> 3<00:03:12.590> which<00:03:12.829> has<00:03:12.950> really<00:03:13.099> helped

00:03:13.390 --> 00:03:13.400 
with that USB 3 which has really helped

00:03:13.400 --> 00:03:16.059 
with that USB 3 which has really helped
me<00:03:13.519> out<00:03:13.549> I<00:03:13.880> know<00:03:14.239> on<00:03:14.450> my<00:03:14.600> old<00:03:14.810> Lacey<00:03:15.079> hard<00:03:15.799> drive

00:03:16.059 --> 00:03:16.069 
me out I know on my old Lacey hard drive

00:03:16.069 --> 00:03:18.190 
me out I know on my old Lacey hard drive
which<00:03:16.250> was<00:03:16.430> basically<00:03:16.639> two<00:03:17.510> one<00:03:17.810> terabyte

00:03:18.190 --> 00:03:18.200 
which was basically two one terabyte

00:03:18.200 --> 00:03:21.280 
which was basically two one terabyte
drives<00:03:18.560> rated<00:03:19.010> together<00:03:19.280> in<00:03:19.519> raid<00:03:20.090> 0<00:03:20.120> I<00:03:20.840> always

00:03:21.280 --> 00:03:21.290 
drives rated together in raid 0 I always

00:03:21.290 --> 00:03:22.300 
drives rated together in raid 0 I always
thought<00:03:21.470> that'd<00:03:21.620> be<00:03:21.769> a<00:03:21.799> little<00:03:21.950> bit<00:03:22.100> quicker

00:03:22.300 --> 00:03:22.310 
thought that'd be a little bit quicker

00:03:22.310 --> 00:03:24.160 
thought that'd be a little bit quicker
but<00:03:22.760> I<00:03:22.819> know<00:03:23.030> it's<00:03:23.269> that<00:03:23.389> with<00:03:23.480> my<00:03:23.600> macbook<00:03:24.019> air

00:03:24.160 --> 00:03:24.170 
but I know it's that with my macbook air

00:03:24.170 --> 00:03:25.449 
but I know it's that with my macbook air
maybe<00:03:24.410> just<00:03:24.680> because<00:03:24.829> the<00:03:24.920> drive<00:03:25.130> was<00:03:25.250> getting

00:03:25.449 --> 00:03:25.459 
maybe just because the drive was getting

00:03:25.459 --> 00:03:26.910 
maybe just because the drive was getting
older<00:03:25.790> and<00:03:25.849> one<00:03:26.000> of<00:03:26.060> the<00:03:26.120> drives<00:03:26.359> is<00:03:26.540> failing

00:03:26.910 --> 00:03:26.920 
older and one of the drives is failing

00:03:26.920 --> 00:03:29.800 
older and one of the drives is failing
now<00:03:27.920> that<00:03:28.130> the<00:03:28.220> USB<00:03:28.670> really<00:03:29.389> took<00:03:29.510> a<00:03:29.630> long<00:03:29.780> time

00:03:29.800 --> 00:03:29.810 
now that the USB really took a long time

00:03:29.810 --> 00:03:31.390 
now that the USB really took a long time
to<00:03:30.049> connect<00:03:30.410> to<00:03:30.500> the<00:03:30.590> macbook<00:03:30.980> air<00:03:31.160> especially

00:03:31.390 --> 00:03:31.400 
to connect to the macbook air especially

00:03:31.400 --> 00:03:33.610 
to connect to the macbook air especially
trying<00:03:31.880> to<00:03:31.970> play<00:03:32.180> my<00:03:32.359> music<00:03:32.500> it<00:03:33.500> basically

00:03:33.610 --> 00:03:33.620 
trying to play my music it basically

00:03:33.620 --> 00:03:35.379 
trying to play my music it basically
took<00:03:34.040> probably<00:03:34.220> five<00:03:34.549> minutes<00:03:34.880> just<00:03:34.940> to<00:03:35.209> see

00:03:35.379 --> 00:03:35.389 
took probably five minutes just to see

00:03:35.389 --> 00:03:38.620 
took probably five minutes just to see
the<00:03:35.540> drive<00:03:35.810> through<00:03:36.109> USB<00:03:36.440> 2<00:03:36.769> with<00:03:37.549> this<00:03:37.730> one<00:03:37.940> no

00:03:38.620 --> 00:03:38.630 
the drive through USB 2 with this one no

00:03:38.630 --> 00:03:40.089 
the drive through USB 2 with this one no
prom<00:03:38.840> at<00:03:38.959> all<00:03:39.049> it's<00:03:39.200> nice<00:03:39.380> and<00:03:39.530> quick<00:03:39.709> you<00:03:39.829> plug

00:03:40.089 --> 00:03:40.099 
prom at all it's nice and quick you plug

00:03:40.099 --> 00:03:41.770 
prom at all it's nice and quick you plug
it<00:03:40.220> in<00:03:40.340> you<00:03:40.459> it's<00:03:40.579> probably<00:03:40.940> on<00:03:41.359> your<00:03:41.569> desktop

00:03:41.770 --> 00:03:41.780 
it in you it's probably on your desktop

00:03:41.780 --> 00:03:44.979 
it in you it's probably on your desktop
within<00:03:42.109> 10<00:03:42.290> seconds<00:03:42.739> if<00:03:43.459> not<00:03:43.669> shorter<00:03:44.120> and<00:03:44.780> the

00:03:44.979 --> 00:03:44.989 
within 10 seconds if not shorter and the

00:03:44.989 --> 00:03:46.659 
within 10 seconds if not shorter and the
USB<00:03:45.290> 3<00:03:45.620> i<00:03:45.650> think<00:03:45.889> is<00:03:45.980> a<00:03:46.010> lot<00:03:46.220> to<00:03:46.310> do<00:03:46.459> with<00:03:46.489> that

00:03:46.659 --> 00:03:46.669 
USB 3 i think is a lot to do with that

00:03:46.669 --> 00:03:48.759 
USB 3 i think is a lot to do with that
even<00:03:46.970> though<00:03:47.120> another<00:03:47.359> max<00:03:47.780> have<00:03:48.019> USB<00:03:48.349> 3

00:03:48.759 --> 00:03:48.769 
even though another max have USB 3

00:03:48.769 --> 00:03:50.800 
even though another max have USB 3
compatibility<00:03:49.489> built<00:03:49.730> into<00:03:50.000> them<00:03:50.150> I<00:03:50.329> think

00:03:50.800 --> 00:03:50.810 
compatibility built into them I think

00:03:50.810 --> 00:03:52.659 
compatibility built into them I think
usb3<00:03:51.200> might<00:03:51.590> be<00:03:51.709> speeding<00:03:52.130> up<00:03:52.220> a<00:03:52.340> little<00:03:52.549> bit

00:03:52.659 --> 00:03:52.669 
usb3 might be speeding up a little bit

00:03:52.669 --> 00:03:54.550 
usb3 might be speeding up a little bit
and<00:03:52.730> actually<00:03:53.000> pushing<00:03:53.329> more<00:03:53.480> info<00:03:53.810> into<00:03:54.139> that

00:03:54.550 --> 00:03:54.560 
and actually pushing more info into that

00:03:54.560 --> 00:03:57.430 
and actually pushing more info into that
USB<00:03:54.829> 2<00:03:55.160> port<00:03:55.430> on<00:03:55.579> my<00:03:55.609> macbook<00:03:55.910> air<00:03:56.269> that<00:03:57.260> could

00:03:57.430 --> 00:03:57.440 
USB 2 port on my macbook air that could

00:03:57.440 --> 00:03:59.229 
USB 2 port on my macbook air that could
be<00:03:57.470> that's<00:03:57.919> just<00:03:58.010> my<00:03:58.190> theory<00:03:58.459> but<00:03:58.700> it<00:03:58.880> comes<00:03:59.090> up

00:03:59.229 --> 00:03:59.239 
be that's just my theory but it comes up

00:03:59.239 --> 00:04:01.240 
be that's just my theory but it comes up
much<00:03:59.419> quicker<00:03:59.450> through<00:04:00.319> USB<00:04:00.590> which<00:04:00.950> I<00:04:01.069> always

00:04:01.240 --> 00:04:01.250 
much quicker through USB which I always

00:04:01.250 --> 00:04:02.650 
much quicker through USB which I always
thought<00:04:01.400> was<00:04:01.549> quite<00:04:01.669> slow<00:04:02.060> it<00:04:02.209> actually<00:04:02.540> has

00:04:02.650 --> 00:04:02.660 
thought was quite slow it actually has

00:04:02.660 --> 00:04:06.400 
thought was quite slow it actually has
not<00:04:02.840> leg<00:04:03.139> whatsoever<00:04:03.980> playing<00:04:04.970> my<00:04:05.299> huge<00:04:06.109> mass

00:04:06.400 --> 00:04:06.410 
not leg whatsoever playing my huge mass

00:04:10.240 --> 00:04:10.250 
on this thing that's nice redundancy

00:04:10.250 --> 00:04:11.789 
on this thing that's nice redundancy
never<00:04:10.519> backed<00:04:10.819> up<00:04:11.000> in<00:04:11.150> this<00:04:11.239> enclosure

never backed up in this enclosure
definitely<00:04:12.799> helps<00:04:12.980> me<00:04:13.130> live<00:04:13.430> there<00:04:13.639> in<00:04:13.760> the

definitely helps me live there in the

00:04:13.849 --> 00:04:15.490 
definitely helps me live there in the
Lacey<00:04:14.060> or<00:04:14.239> if<00:04:14.450> it<00:04:14.540> all<00:04:14.630> filled<00:04:14.870> I<00:04:15.049> was<00:04:15.200> pretty

00:04:15.490 --> 00:04:15.500 
Lacey or if it all filled I was pretty

00:04:15.500 --> 00:04:18.159 
Lacey or if it all filled I was pretty
much<00:04:15.650> toast<00:04:15.980> for<00:04:16.789> the<00:04:16.880> night<00:04:17.060> so<00:04:17.750> because<00:04:18.079> I

00:04:18.159 --> 00:04:18.169 
much toast for the night so because I

00:04:18.169 --> 00:04:19.990 
much toast for the night so because I
won't<00:04:18.500> be<00:04:18.530> able<00:04:18.620> to<00:04:18.769> DJ<00:04:19.039> but<00:04:19.340> what<00:04:19.880> I<00:04:19.909> think

00:04:19.990 --> 00:04:20.000 
won't be able to DJ but what I think

00:04:20.000 --> 00:04:21.699 
won't be able to DJ but what I think
about<00:04:20.299> this<00:04:20.419> thing<00:04:20.630> besides<00:04:20.930> the<00:04:21.049> USB<00:04:21.440> port

00:04:21.699 --> 00:04:21.709 
about this thing besides the USB port

00:04:21.709 --> 00:04:22.690 
about this thing besides the USB port
it's<00:04:21.859> really<00:04:22.130> solid

00:04:22.690 --> 00:04:22.700 
it's really solid

00:04:22.700 --> 00:04:24.670 
it's really solid
it's<00:04:23.390> probably<00:04:23.660> the<00:04:23.750> best<00:04:24.020> built<00:04:24.320> enclosure

00:04:24.670 --> 00:04:24.680 
it's probably the best built enclosure

00:04:24.680 --> 00:04:25.780

enclosures on their hard drives it was
they've<00:04:31.550> always<00:04:31.850> been<00:04:31.970> really<00:04:32.210> well<00:04:32.660> built

00:04:32.920 --> 00:04:32.930 
they've always been really well built

00:04:32.930 --> 00:04:34.960 
they've always been really well built
and<00:04:33.200> they<00:04:33.320> built<00:04:33.350> and<00:04:34.040> built<00:04:34.190> like<00:04:34.370> a<00:04:34.400> tank<00:04:34.490> so

00:04:34.960 --> 00:04:34.970 
and they built and built like a tank so

00:04:34.970 --> 00:04:36.970 
and they built and built like a tank so
you<00:04:35.060> feel<00:04:36.050> like<00:04:36.170> you<00:04:36.260> can<00:04:36.410> actually<00:04:36.560> bump<00:04:36.890> this

you feel like you can actually bump this

00:04:36.980 --> 00:04:37.840 
you feel like you can actually bump this
thing<00:04:37.190> around<00:04:37.280> a<00:04:37.490> little<00:04:37.610> bit<00:04:37.730> without

00:04:37.840 --> 00:04:37.850 
thing around a little bit without

thing around a little bit without
actually<00:04:38.210> breaking<00:04:38.420> it<00:04:38.840> which<00:04:39.410> can't<00:04:39.650> be<00:04:39.710> said

00:04:39.820 --> 00:04:39.830 
actually breaking it which can't be said

00:04:39.830 --> 00:04:41.530 
actually breaking it which can't be said
for<00:04:40.190> all<00:04:40.280> hard<00:04:40.550> drive<00:04:40.760> enclosures<00:04:41.330> maybe

00:04:41.530 --> 00:04:41.540 
for all hard drive enclosures maybe

00:04:41.540 --> 00:04:42.910 
for all hard drive enclosures maybe
those<00:04:41.750> pocket<00:04:42.140> drives<00:04:42.380> that<00:04:42.590> look<00:04:42.770> like

00:04:42.910 --> 00:04:42.920 
those pocket drives that look like

00:04:42.920 --> 00:04:44.650 
those pocket drives that look like
they're<00:04:43.100> metal<00:04:43.310> and<00:04:43.580> some<00:04:44.240> of<00:04:44.330> its<00:04:44.420> plastic

00:04:44.650 --> 00:04:44.660 
they're metal and some of its plastic

00:04:44.660 --> 00:04:46.990 
they're metal and some of its plastic
this<00:04:45.170> thing<00:04:45.380> is<00:04:45.500> all<00:04:45.710> metal<00:04:45.980> front<00:04:46.760> to<00:04:46.850> back

00:04:46.990 --> 00:04:47.000 
this thing is all metal front to back

00:04:47.000 --> 00:04:49.870 
this thing is all metal front to back
which<00:04:47.810> is<00:04:47.960> really<00:04:48.140> nice<00:04:48.320> and<00:04:48.640> not<00:04:49.640> only<00:04:49.760> that

00:04:49.870 --> 00:04:49.880 
which is really nice and not only that

00:04:49.880 --> 00:04:51.970 
which is really nice and not only that
it<00:04:50.450> looks<00:04:50.900> like<00:04:51.080> it<00:04:51.230> can<00:04:51.350> last<00:04:51.560> a<00:04:51.740> long<00:04:51.920> time

00:04:51.970 --> 00:04:51.980 
it looks like it can last a long time

00:04:51.980 --> 00:04:54.330 
it looks like it can last a long time
and<00:04:52.310> I<00:04:52.550> hope<00:04:52.700> it<00:04:52.850> does<00:04:53.000> last<00:04:53.210> a<00:04:53.420> long<00:04:53.570> time

00:04:54.330 --> 00:04:54.340 
and I hope it does last a long time

00:04:54.340 --> 00:04:57.610 
and I hope it does last a long time
because<00:04:55.340> it<00:04:55.520> was<00:04:55.730> quite<00:04:56.180> expensive<00:04:56.600> I<00:04:57.020> think<00:04:57.560> I

00:04:57.610 --> 00:04:57.620 
because it was quite expensive I think I

00:04:57.620 --> 00:04:59.080 
because it was quite expensive I think I
picked<00:04:57.800> it<00:04:57.890> up<00:04:57.950> for<00:04:58.130> about<00:04:58.250> 500<00:04:58.760> it's<00:04:58.850> actually

00:04:59.080 --> 00:04:59.090 
picked it up for about 500 it's actually

00:04:59.090 --> 00:05:00.370 
picked it up for about 500 it's actually
a<00:04:59.120> little<00:04:59.270> bit<00:04:59.480> more<00:04:59.660> expensive<00:04:59.930> now<00:05:00.260> I<00:05:00.290> just

00:05:00.370 --> 00:05:00.380 
a little bit more expensive now I just

00:05:00.380 --> 00:05:02.650 
a little bit more expensive now I just
check<00:05:00.740> out<00:05:00.920> the<00:05:01.040> site<00:05:01.310> but<00:05:02.090> um<00:05:02.300> if<00:05:02.510> you're

all backed up in that one safe secure
location<00:05:44.630> so<00:05:44.810> i<00:05:44.840> give<00:05:45.200> it<00:05:45.320> two<00:05:45.470> thumbs<00:05:45.500> up<00:05:45.980> I

location so i give it two thumbs up I

00:05:46.130 --> 00:05:47.680 
location so i give it two thumbs up I
think<00:05:46.370> it's<00:05:46.460> a<00:05:46.520> great<00:05:46.700> Drive<00:05:47.060> it's<00:05:47.300> performed

00:05:47.680 --> 00:05:47.690
