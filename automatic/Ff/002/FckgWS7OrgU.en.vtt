through the 60s 70s and 80s tones it's

00:00:16.830 --> 00:00:20.269 
through the 60s 70s and 80s tones it's
quite<00:00:17.190> unique<00:00:17.520> in<00:00:17.760> that<00:00:17.840> it<00:00:18.840> only<00:00:18.960> has<00:00:19.650> 25

00:00:20.269 --> 00:00:20.279 
quite unique in that it only has 25

00:00:20.279 --> 00:00:22.550 
quite unique in that it only has 25
watts<00:00:20.699> but<00:00:21.090> it's<00:00:21.510> pretty<00:00:21.689> powerful<00:00:21.990> and<00:00:22.529> I

00:00:22.550 --> 00:00:22.560 
watts but it's pretty powerful and I

00:00:22.560 --> 00:00:24.140 
watts but it's pretty powerful and I
played<00:00:22.830> this<00:00:22.980> with<00:00:23.130> a<00:00:23.189> band<00:00:23.490> without<00:00:23.820> any

00:00:24.140 --> 00:00:24.150 
played this with a band without any

00:00:24.150 --> 00:00:26.960 
played this with a band without any
issues<00:00:24.570> it<00:00:25.260> doesn't<00:00:25.740> have<00:00:25.890> a<00:00:25.920> reverb<00:00:26.340> but<00:00:26.849> it

00:00:26.960 --> 00:00:26.970 
issues it doesn't have a reverb but it

00:00:26.970 --> 00:00:29.150 
issues it doesn't have a reverb but it
does<00:00:27.119> have<00:00:27.330> an<00:00:27.449> effects<00:00:27.750> loop<00:00:27.890> unlike<00:00:28.890> the

00:00:29.150 --> 00:00:29.160 
does have an effects loop unlike the

00:00:29.160 --> 00:00:31.820 
does have an effects loop unlike the
original<00:00:29.390> jcm800<00:00:30.390> so<00:00:31.320> we're<00:00:31.439> going<00:00:31.560> to<00:00:31.619> listen

00:00:31.820 --> 00:00:31.830 
original jcm800 so we're going to listen

00:00:31.830 --> 00:00:34.130 
original jcm800 so we're going to listen
to<00:00:32.009> a<00:00:32.040> few<00:00:32.279> sounds<00:00:32.820> and<00:00:33.030> then<00:00:33.480> maybe<00:00:33.719> later<00:00:33.989> on

00:00:34.130 --> 00:00:34.140 
to a few sounds and then maybe later on

00:00:34.140 --> 00:00:36.080 
to a few sounds and then maybe later on
I'll<00:00:34.290> follow<00:00:34.710> up<00:00:34.920> this<00:00:35.190> video<00:00:35.550> with<00:00:35.850> a

00:00:36.080 --> 00:00:36.090 
I'll follow up this video with a

00:00:36.090 --> 00:00:39.770 
I'll follow up this video with a
comparison<00:00:38.059> sample<00:00:39.059> with<00:00:39.300> an<00:00:39.420> actual

00:00:39.770 --> 00:00:39.780 
comparison sample with an actual

00:00:39.780 --> 00:00:43.580 
comparison sample with an actual
marshall<00:00:40.290> jcm800<00:00:41.219> from<00:00:41.850> 1985<00:00:42.690> and<00:00:43.110> then

00:00:43.580 --> 00:00:43.590 
marshall jcm800 from 1985 and then

00:00:43.590 --> 00:00:45.440 
marshall jcm800 from 1985 and then
eventually<00:00:43.890> if<00:00:44.309> I<00:00:44.430> get<00:00:44.610> enough<00:00:44.820> requests

00:00:45.440 --> 00:00:45.450 
eventually if I get enough requests

00:00:45.450 --> 00:00:47.060 
eventually if I get enough requests
maybe<00:00:45.690> we'll<00:00:45.930> do<00:00:46.110> a<00:00:46.140> side-by-side<00:00:46.590> comparison

00:00:47.060 --> 00:00:47.070 
maybe we'll do a side-by-side comparison

00:00:47.070 --> 00:00:50.000 
maybe we'll do a side-by-side comparison
and<00:00:47.910> see<00:00:48.090> how<00:00:48.270> the<00:00:48.329> two<00:00:48.539> stack<00:00:48.840> up<00:00:49.020> so<00:00:49.710> stay

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:50.010 
and see how the two stack up so stay

00:00:50.010 --> 00:00:52.100 
and see how the two stack up so stay
tuned<00:00:50.309> and<00:00:50.640> give<00:00:51.390> me<00:00:51.480> some<00:00:51.660> feedback

00:00:52.100 --> 00:00:52.110 
tuned and give me some feedback

00:00:52.110 --> 00:00:55.580 
tuned and give me some feedback
thanks<00:00:52.559> let's<00:00:53.340> look<00:00:53.579> at<00:00:53.730> the<00:00:53.940> 80s<00:00:54.539> mode<00:00:54.780> the

00:00:55.580 --> 00:00:55.590 
thanks let's look at the 80s mode the

00:00:55.590 --> 00:00:58.279 
thanks let's look at the 80s mode the
80s<00:00:55.949> mode<00:00:56.190> is<00:00:56.399> one<00:00:56.610> of<00:00:56.730> my<00:00:56.820> favourite<00:00:57.239> modes<00:00:57.510> it

00:00:58.279 --> 00:00:58.289 
80s mode is one of my favourite modes it

00:00:58.289 --> 00:01:02.569 
80s mode is one of my favourite modes it
has<00:00:58.500> the<00:00:58.680> most<00:00:58.829> gain<00:00:59.219> so<00:01:01.039> let's<00:01:02.039> switch<00:01:02.160> over

00:01:02.569 --> 00:01:02.579 
has the most gain so let's switch over

00:01:02.579 --> 00:01:05.390 
has the most gain so let's switch over
to<00:01:02.609> the<00:01:02.820> 80s<00:01:03.149> mode<00:01:03.449> and<00:01:03.920> I'm<00:01:04.920> gonna<00:01:05.129> put<00:01:05.309> the

00:01:05.390 --> 00:01:05.400 
to the 80s mode and I'm gonna put the

00:01:05.400 --> 00:01:07.670 
to the 80s mode and I'm gonna put the
master<00:01:05.790> relatively<00:01:06.450> low<00:01:06.720> because<00:01:06.960> we<00:01:07.170> are<00:01:07.439> in

00:01:07.670 --> 00:01:07.680 
master relatively low because we are in

00:01:07.680 --> 00:01:09.859 
master relatively low because we are in
a<00:01:07.830> room<00:01:08.070> and<00:01:08.460> I<00:01:08.909> don't<00:01:08.970> want<00:01:09.270> the<00:01:09.390> microphone

00:01:09.859 --> 00:01:09.869 
a room and I don't want the microphone

00:01:09.869 --> 00:01:13.100 
a room and I don't want the microphone
to<00:01:10.020> clip<00:01:10.580> volume<00:01:11.580> is<00:01:11.729> pretty<00:01:12.150> much<00:01:12.360> maxed<00:01:12.750> at

00:01:13.100 --> 00:01:13.110 
to clip volume is pretty much maxed at

00:01:13.110 --> 00:01:17.539 
to clip volume is pretty much maxed at
about<00:01:14.119> between<00:01:15.119> 10<00:01:15.479> and<00:01:15.509> 11<00:01:16.070> so<00:01:17.070> let's<00:01:17.280> see

00:01:17.539 --> 00:01:17.549 
about between 10 and 11 so let's see

00:01:17.549 --> 00:02:06.240 
about between 10 and 11 so let's see
what<00:01:17.729> we<00:01:17.850> get

00:02:06.240 --> 00:02:06.250 

00:02:06.250 --> 00:02:11.110 

all<00:02:07.250> right<00:02:08.679> now<00:02:09.679> if<00:02:09.860> we<00:02:10.009> lower<00:02:10.160> the<00:02:10.399> volume<00:02:10.519> and

00:02:11.110 --> 00:02:11.120 
all right now if we lower the volume and

00:02:11.120 --> 00:02:14.110 
all right now if we lower the volume and
bring<00:02:11.390> up<00:02:11.540> the<00:02:11.660> master<00:02:12.140> on<00:02:12.260> this<00:02:12.530> channel<00:02:13.120> you

00:02:14.110 --> 00:02:14.120 
bring up the master on this channel you

00:02:14.120 --> 00:02:17.130 
bring up the master on this channel you
can<00:02:14.150> get<00:02:14.480> we've<00:02:15.080> got<00:02:15.200> a<00:02:15.230> pretty<00:02:15.500> clean<00:02:15.950> sound

bit<00:05:03.490> more<00:05:03.820> like<00:05:04.570> the<00:05:04.780> plexi<00:05:05.610> you<00:05:06.610> can<00:05:06.789> still

00:05:07.020 --> 00:05:07.030 
bit more like the plexi you can still

00:05:07.030 --> 00:06:06.180 
bit more like the plexi you can still
get<00:05:07.240> some<00:05:07.270> nice<00:05:07.690> distorted<00:05:08.289> Distortion

00:06:06.180 --> 00:06:06.190 

00:06:06.190 --> 00:06:35.480 

so<00:06:07.190> you<00:06:07.280> get<00:06:07.460> some<00:06:07.670> nice<00:06:07.880> variation<00:06:08.720> in<00:06:08.810> tone

00:06:35.480 --> 00:06:35.490 

00:06:35.490 --> 00:06:38.210 

the<00:06:36.419> app<00:06:36.539> is<00:06:36.750> quite<00:06:37.020> flexible<00:06:37.289> like<00:06:37.860> I<00:06:37.979> said

00:06:38.210 --> 00:06:38.220 
the app is quite flexible like I said

00:06:38.220 --> 00:06:41.210 
the app is quite flexible like I said
for<00:06:38.400> 25<00:06:38.850> watts<00:06:39.300> it's<00:06:39.600> very<00:06:39.870> loud<00:06:40.169> I'm<00:06:40.470> playing

00:06:41.210 --> 00:06:41.220 
for 25 watts it's very loud I'm playing

00:06:41.220 --> 00:06:43.790 
for 25 watts it's very loud I'm playing
very<00:06:42.120> low<00:06:42.479> right<00:06:42.750> now<00:06:42.810> so<00:06:43.020> you're<00:06:43.410> not<00:06:43.560> getting

00:06:43.790 --> 00:06:43.800 
very low right now so you're not getting

00:06:43.800 --> 00:06:47.839 
very low right now so you're not getting
the<00:06:44.039> full<00:06:44.460> base<00:06:44.789> response<00:06:45.360> because<00:06:46.639> the<00:06:47.639> mic

00:06:47.839 --> 00:06:47.849 
the full base response because the mic

00:06:47.849 --> 00:06:51.050 
the full base response because the mic
is<00:06:48.090> gonna<00:06:48.300> clip<00:06:48.660> but<00:06:49.259> I<00:06:49.770> played<00:06:50.430> with<00:06:50.460> a<00:06:50.729> band

00:06:51.050 --> 00:06:51.060 
is gonna clip but I played with a band

00:06:51.060 --> 00:06:53.839 
is gonna clip but I played with a band
with<00:06:51.660> this<00:06:51.900> amplifier<00:06:52.199> and<00:06:52.530> has<00:06:53.039> no<00:06:53.280> problems

00:06:53.839 --> 00:06:53.849 
with this amplifier and has no problems

00:06:53.849 --> 00:06:55.879 
with this amplifier and has no problems
and<00:06:54.060> it<00:06:54.509> actually<00:06:54.660> sounds<00:06:55.169> very<00:06:55.349> good<00:06:55.680> when

00:06:55.879 --> 00:06:55.889 
and it actually sounds very good when

00:06:55.889 --> 00:06:58.370 
and it actually sounds very good when
it's<00:06:56.069> cranked<00:06:56.580> pretty<00:06:57.150> loud<00:06:57.449> it<00:06:58.020> has<00:06:58.199> an

00:06:58.370 --> 00:06:58.380 
it's cranked pretty loud it has an

00:06:58.380 --> 00:06:59.390 
it's cranked pretty loud it has an
effects<00:06:58.770> loop

00:06:59.390 --> 00:06:59.400 
effects loop

00:06:59.400 --> 00:07:03.320 
effects loop
unlike<00:07:00.240> the<00:07:00.479> jcm800<00:07:01.440> the<00:07:02.220> original<00:07:02.639> one<00:07:02.789> has

00:07:03.320 --> 00:07:03.330 
unlike the jcm800 the original one has

00:07:03.330 --> 00:07:08.060 
unlike the jcm800 the original one has
an<00:07:03.569> effects<00:07:03.870> loop<00:07:03.990> and<00:07:04.440> it<00:07:05.220> has<00:07:05.780> no<00:07:06.780> reverb<00:07:07.229> so

00:07:08.060 --> 00:07:08.070 
an effects loop and it has no reverb so

00:07:08.070 --> 00:07:11.060 
an effects loop and it has no reverb so
if<00:07:08.940> you<00:07:09.150> want<00:07:09.360> a<00:07:09.479> reverb<00:07:09.900> on<00:07:10.139> this<00:07:10.560> particular

00:07:11.060 --> 00:07:11.070 
if you want a reverb on this particular

00:07:11.070 --> 00:07:12.700 
if you want a reverb on this particular
app<00:07:11.250> you're<00:07:11.490> gonna<00:07:11.610> have<00:07:11.880> to<00:07:12.030> go<00:07:12.180> in<00:07:12.360> and

00:07:12.700 --> 00:07:12.710 
app you're gonna have to go in and

00:07:12.710 --> 00:07:15.439 
app you're gonna have to go in and
probably<00:07:13.710> get<00:07:13.889> a<00:07:13.919> reverb<00:07:14.310> pedal<00:07:14.520> so<00:07:15.210> that's

00:07:15.439 --> 00:07:15.449 
probably get a reverb pedal so that's

00:07:15.449 --> 00:07:18.860 
probably get a reverb pedal so that's
about<00:07:15.599> it<00:07:15.750> I<00:07:16.110> hope<00:07:16.380> you<00:07:16.530> enjoyed<00:07:17.009> this<00:07:17.639> part<00:07:18.479> 1

00:07:18.860 --> 00:07:18.870 
about it I hope you enjoyed this part 1

00:07:18.870 --> 00:07:21.589 
about it I hope you enjoyed this part 1

2<00:07:22.310> I'm<00:07:23.310> going<00:07:23.580> to<00:07:23.669> follow<00:07:23.849> up<00:07:24.030> this<00:07:24.449> video<00:07:24.840> with

00:07:25.159 --> 00:07:25.169 
2 I'm going to follow up this video with

00:07:25.169 --> 00:07:30.320 
2 I'm going to follow up this video with
a<00:07:25.440> clip<00:07:26.099> of<00:07:26.310> the<00:07:26.490> jcm800<00:07:27.449> it's<00:07:28.320> a<00:07:28.470> 1985<00:07:29.400> version

00:07:30.320 --> 00:07:30.330 
a clip of the jcm800 it's a 1985 version

00:07:30.330 --> 00:07:32.990 
a clip of the jcm800 it's a 1985 version
and<00:07:30.509> that<00:07:31.169> maybe<00:07:31.470> I'll<00:07:31.710> do<00:07:31.979> a<00:07:32.310> comparison

00:07:32.990 --> 00:07:33.000 
and that maybe I'll do a comparison

00:07:33.000 --> 00:07:37.759 
and that maybe I'll do a comparison
between<00:07:33.479> the<00:07:33.930> two<00:07:34.280> thanks<00:07:35.280> for<00:07:35.430> watching
