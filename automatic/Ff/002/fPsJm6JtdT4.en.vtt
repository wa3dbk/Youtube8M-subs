 As you can see 

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:38.340
 I built three blocks of berg 

00:00:38.340 --> 00:00:41.340

00:00:41.960 --> 00:00:43.960

00:01:13.690 --> 00:01:16.180
 understanding kravets 

00:01:16.180 --> 00:01:19.100
 rise on cleaning 

00:01:19.100 --> 00:01:20.950
 but pamela herself spent 

00:01:20.950 --> 00:01:24.050
 as you can see I became 18 already 

00:01:24.050 --> 00:01:25.920
 invader tenge 

00:01:25.920 --> 00:01:27.740

00:01:27.740 --> 00:01:29.600

00:01:29.600 --> 00:01:32.600
 after all, they have already become 3 

00:01:36.140 --> 00:01:39.140
 but let's leave the crosses 

00:01:42.080 --> 00:01:43.690
 push 

00:01:43.690 --> 00:01:46.690
 specifically to 120 

00:01:52.050 --> 00:01:53.520

00:01:58.490 --> 00:02:00.640
 already immediately restored how though this is not 

00:02:00.640 --> 00:02:03.190
 must be 

00:02:03.190 --> 00:02:04.670

 veterans though ends but cut off 

00:02:19.219 --> 00:02:20.459
 recover using this 

00:02:20.459 --> 00:02:21.939
 programs 

00:02:21.939 --> 00:02:23.959
 we can do it 

00:02:23.959 --> 00:02:26.189
 although you can fight against the leaders on them 

00:02:26.189 --> 00:02:28.489
 I wonâ€™t be able to do anything easier 

00:02:28.489 --> 00:02:30.319
 Total
