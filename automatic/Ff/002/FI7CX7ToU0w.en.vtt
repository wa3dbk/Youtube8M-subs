00:00:04.069 --> 00:00:09.960
 Galera speaks good beauty and trick in the video 

00:00:07.200 --> 00:00:12.570
 the video there gta5 will teach as if 

00:00:09.960 --> 00:00:14.730
 catch the largest airplane in the game one way 

00:00:12.570 --> 00:00:18.390
 faster and more practical 

00:00:14.730 --> 00:00:21.180
 good first I go here on the map 

00:00:18.390 --> 00:00:23.460
 I'm going here on the beach right here, or 

00:00:21.180 --> 00:00:27.390
 minus this one right here 

00:00:23.460 --> 00:00:29.699
 so when I get there I'll be back 

00:00:27.390 --> 00:00:35.370
 Good guys come here on the beach there. 

00:00:29.699 --> 00:00:38.130
 arrives at the civil beach by a jet ski oc1 

00:00:35.370 --> 00:00:40.470
 there your life is always there 

00:00:38.130 --> 00:00:41.399
 park that is what saves lives then 

00:00:40.470 --> 00:00:43.560
 people will get him 

00:00:41.399 --> 00:00:44.640
 We do not even go by the edge of the beach. 

00:00:43.560 --> 00:00:49.079
 so much 

00:00:44.640 --> 00:00:52.550
 There's no peace, we 're such a fuck. 

00:00:49.079 --> 00:00:52.550
 there he celebrates 

00:00:53.510 --> 00:00:58.699
 So you go well where are those 

00:00:55.910 --> 00:01:00.469
 posts and las and posts and antennas do not know 

00:00:58.699 --> 00:01:03.890
 if it goes in a direction that it manages the 

00:01:00.469 --> 00:01:05.990
 right airport that goes by is by 

00:01:03.890 --> 00:01:08.630
 because soon the front will have a 

00:01:05.990 --> 00:01:12.740
 surrounded and will have a little door you go 

00:01:08.630 --> 00:01:16.009
 getting into a car ended that era 

00:01:12.740 --> 00:01:18.729
 the first Monday in this third that 

00:01:16.009 --> 00:01:18.729
 jet season 

00:01:20.409 --> 00:01:26.999
 He's saying that he's going to come up here. 

00:01:31.110 --> 00:01:38.620
 well this wire mesh here has a 

00:01:35.170 --> 00:01:41.320
 door that she's open to the medial 

00:01:38.620 --> 00:01:43.380
 it or if you have a car here O 

00:01:41.320 --> 00:01:46.690
 always have a car that is black here 

00:01:43.380 --> 00:01:50.160
 so I do not know how to steal a black car 

00:01:46.690 --> 00:01:52.720
 generates three policemen you as now 

00:01:50.160 --> 00:01:56.340
 We'll go find the plane now. 

00:01:52.720 --> 00:01:56.340
 let's go there old 

00:01:59.200 --> 00:02:03.520
 the plane that should be addressed to me 

00:02:01.330 --> 00:02:05.140
 largest game is a two story 

00:02:03.520 --> 00:02:07.380
 can be anyone who has 2007 

00:02:05.140 --> 00:02:14.860
 came two floors can tighten a 

00:02:07.380 --> 00:02:18.490
 center triangle in a jumbo jet and 

00:02:14.860 --> 00:02:20.200
 Think it 's a very good time, okay? 

00:02:18.490 --> 00:02:22.840
 This is the one that best matches the 

00:02:20.200 --> 00:02:25.050
 alviverde control of part of the 

00:02:22.840 --> 00:02:25.050
 triangle 

00:02:25.510 --> 00:02:32.590
 already the alloy turbine to the l2 it takes 

00:02:28.090 --> 00:02:34.569
 a little more apart r 1 is for 

00:02:32.590 --> 00:02:37.680
 right there 

00:02:34.569 --> 00:02:37.680
 so the 

00:02:38.720 --> 00:02:41.930
 playing is 

00:02:45.819 --> 00:02:49.200
 just be 

00:02:52.750 --> 00:02:59.080
 is still very low up behind the 

00:02:55.420 --> 00:03:03.060
 picture of a sec I'll get the message 

00:02:59.080 --> 00:03:03.060
 damn actions we have nothing 

00:03:04.780 --> 00:03:14.140
 he still made the goal very fast only if 

00:03:08.110 --> 00:03:17.470
 Pull up, love, I 'm just going to take the flight to 

00:03:14.140 --> 00:03:19.000
 police firing a woman turbine 

00:03:17.470 --> 00:03:21.160
 I think the video stayed here is fine. 

00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:22.300
 easy to catch my face but I was waiting for the 

00:03:21.160 --> 00:03:27.989
 size of the organ compared to the 

00:03:22.300 --> 00:03:30.459
 helicopter and I from a height here 

00:03:27.989 --> 00:03:32.709
 as it is so critical for it to give a 

00:03:30.459 --> 00:03:35.700
 explanation there you go with the car there is 

00:03:32.709 --> 00:03:37.750
 much better in my opinion then you 

00:03:35.700 --> 00:03:40.739
 I like you, Knox. 

00:03:37.750 --> 00:03:40.739
 I think I'm going to blow up the plane. 

00:03:41.209 --> 00:03:45.110
 the heads of cattle per hectare 

00:03:46.319 --> 00:03:50.840
 The goalkeeper here was well said.
