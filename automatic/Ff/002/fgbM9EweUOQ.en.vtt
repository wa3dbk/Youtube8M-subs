at the spawns and you know make sure
that<00:02:55.049> they're<00:02:55.319> not<00:02:55.440> going<00:02:55.590> to<00:02:55.680> be<00:02:55.739> completely

00:02:56.119 --> 00:02:56.129 
that they're not going to be completely

00:02:56.129 --> 00:02:57.740 
that they're not going to be completely
rushing<00:02:56.609> at<00:02:56.760> him<00:02:56.970> so<00:02:57.209> you<00:02:57.390> can<00:02:57.510> you<00:02:57.660> know

00:02:57.740 --> 00:02:57.750 
rushing at him so you can you know

00:02:57.750 --> 00:02:59.390 
rushing at him so you can you know
pinpoint<00:02:58.230> where<00:02:58.560> the<00:02:58.590> people<00:02:58.950> are<00:02:59.160> going<00:02:59.310> to

00:03:00.920 --> 00:03:00.930 
be and that's a really really good

00:03:00.930 --> 00:03:03.170 
be and that's a really really good
tactic<00:03:01.410> all<00:03:01.590> for<00:03:02.250> playing<00:03:02.489> on<00:03:02.640> this<00:03:02.760> map<00:03:03.000> for

00:03:03.170 --> 00:03:03.180 
tactic all for playing on this map for

00:03:03.180 --> 00:03:04.819 
tactic all for playing on this map for
getting<00:03:03.390> multiple<00:03:03.780> mobs<00:03:04.109> and<00:03:04.290> this<00:03:04.620> map

00:03:04.819 --> 00:03:04.829 
getting multiple mobs and this map

00:03:04.829 --> 00:03:07.039 
getting multiple mobs and this map
actually<00:03:05.129> has<00:03:05.489> a<00:03:05.519> lot<00:03:05.910> of<00:03:05.940> triple<00:03:06.390> mobs<00:03:06.690> on<00:03:06.870> it

00:03:07.039 --> 00:03:07.049 
actually has a lot of triple mobs on it

00:03:07.049 --> 00:03:09.860 
actually has a lot of triple mobs on it
um<00:03:07.370> it's<00:03:08.370> a<00:03:08.519> good<00:03:08.730> map<00:03:08.910> in<00:03:09.180> terms<00:03:09.209> of<00:03:09.660> like

00:03:09.860 --> 00:03:09.870 
um it's a good map in terms of like

00:03:09.870 --> 00:03:12.949 
um it's a good map in terms of like
playing<00:03:10.829> ground<00:03:11.190> war<00:03:11.400> I<00:03:11.489> guess<00:03:11.760> and<00:03:12.030> it's<00:03:12.810> kind

00:03:12.949 --> 00:03:12.959 
playing ground war I guess and it's kind

00:03:12.959 --> 00:03:15.860 
playing ground war I guess and it's kind
of<00:03:13.290> slow<00:03:13.530> in<00:03:13.739> terms<00:03:13.950> of<00:03:14.129> 636<00:03:14.489> but<00:03:14.940> overall<00:03:15.660> you

00:03:15.860 --> 00:03:15.870 
of slow in terms of 636 but overall you

00:03:15.870 --> 00:03:18.710 
of slow in terms of 636 but overall you
know<00:03:15.900> you<00:03:16.019> did<00:03:16.290> pull<00:03:16.530> it<00:03:16.709> off<00:03:16.829> and<00:03:17.480> this<00:03:18.480> game

00:03:18.710 --> 00:03:18.720 
know you did pull it off and this game

00:03:18.720 --> 00:03:20.509 
know you did pull it off and this game
right<00:03:18.900> here<00:03:18.930> was<00:03:19.319> actually<00:03:19.799> the<00:03:19.889> game<00:03:20.160> right

00:03:20.509 --> 00:03:20.519 
right here was actually the game right

00:03:20.519 --> 00:03:22.759 
right here was actually the game right
before<00:03:20.970> Israel<00:03:21.750> got<00:03:21.870> their<00:03:22.109> first<00:03:22.290> ever<00:03:22.590> trip

before Israel got their first ever trip
in<00:03:22.950> my<00:03:23.099> lab<00:03:23.250> and<00:03:23.780> this<00:03:24.780> could<00:03:25.200> have<00:03:25.319> been<00:03:25.349> the

00:03:25.490 --> 00:03:25.500 
in my lab and this could have been the

00:03:25.500 --> 00:03:27.050 
in my lab and this could have been the
first<00:03:25.650> triple<00:03:26.010> mob<00:03:26.160> from<00:03:26.489> Israel<00:03:26.940> but

double mob tripping la belle but you
know<00:03:30.810> doping<00:03:31.169> loves<00:03:31.410> are<00:03:31.560> still<00:03:31.739> pretty

00:03:31.909 --> 00:03:31.919 
know doping loves are still pretty

00:03:31.919 --> 00:03:33.409 
know doping loves are still pretty
impressive<00:03:32.430> as<00:03:32.579> you<00:03:32.700> guys<00:03:32.819> can<00:03:32.940> see<00:03:33.000> the<00:03:33.180> first

00:03:33.409 --> 00:03:33.419 
impressive as you guys can see the first

00:03:33.419 --> 00:03:34.970 
impressive as you guys can see the first
mob<00:03:33.599> was<00:03:33.840> really<00:03:34.169> really<00:03:34.349> fast<00:03:34.620> it's<00:03:34.829> just

00:03:34.970 --> 00:03:34.980 
mob was really really fast it's just

00:03:34.980 --> 00:03:37.250 
mob was really really fast it's just
about<00:03:35.160> two<00:03:35.430> minutes<00:03:35.609> long<00:03:35.849> now<00:03:36.569> the<00:03:36.630> second<00:03:37.169> my

00:03:37.250 --> 00:03:37.260 
about two minutes long now the second my

00:03:37.260 --> 00:03:39.740 
about two minutes long now the second my
lab<00:03:37.410> is<00:03:37.560> a<00:03:37.590> lot<00:03:37.980> longer<00:03:38.280> I<00:03:38.669> think<00:03:39.239> mainly<00:03:39.450> for

00:03:39.740 --> 00:03:39.750 
lab is a lot longer I think mainly for

00:03:39.750 --> 00:03:41.720 
lab is a lot longer I think mainly for
the<00:03:39.780> fact<00:03:40.049> that<00:03:40.200> you<00:03:40.739> know<00:03:40.769> he<00:03:41.130> already<00:03:41.370> failed

00:03:41.720 --> 00:03:41.730 
the fact that you know he already failed

00:03:41.730 --> 00:03:44.240 
the fact that you know he already failed
at<00:03:41.940> the<00:03:42.030> triple<00:03:42.419> our<00:03:43.230> at<00:03:43.530> the<00:03:43.680> double<00:03:43.980> excuse

00:03:44.240 --> 00:03:44.250 
at the triple our at the double excuse

00:03:44.250 --> 00:03:46.220 
at the triple our at the double excuse
me<00:03:44.400> and<00:03:44.669> now<00:03:44.970> he<00:03:45.030> was<00:03:45.389> going<00:03:45.599> for<00:03:45.690> the<00:03:45.870> triple

00:03:46.220 --> 00:03:46.230 
me and now he was going for the triple

00:03:46.230 --> 00:03:47.390 
me and now he was going for the triple
but<00:03:46.410> you<00:03:46.530> know<00:03:46.620> what<00:03:46.739> i<00:03:46.799> mean<00:03:46.919> so<00:03:46.980> this<00:03:47.280> is

00:03:47.390 --> 00:03:47.400 
but you know what i mean so this is

00:03:47.400 --> 00:03:48.710 
but you know what i mean so this is
technically<00:03:47.760> the<00:03:47.849> double<00:03:48.239> so<00:03:48.599> you<00:03:48.690> just

00:03:48.710 --> 00:03:48.720 
technically the double so you just

00:03:48.720 --> 00:03:50.270 
technically the double so you just
wanted<00:03:49.079> to<00:03:49.139> play<00:03:49.260> it<00:03:49.410> a<00:03:49.440> little<00:03:49.560> bit<00:03:49.769> more<00:03:49.950> slow

00:03:50.270 --> 00:03:50.280 
wanted to play it a little bit more slow

00:03:50.280 --> 00:03:51.680 
wanted to play it a little bit more slow
and<00:03:50.579> make<00:03:50.700> sure<00:03:50.730> that<00:03:51.000> he<00:03:51.090> could<00:03:51.239> secure<00:03:51.540> that

00:03:51.680 --> 00:03:51.690 
and make sure that he could secure that

00:03:51.690 --> 00:03:54.080 
and make sure that he could secure that
all<00:03:51.900> that<00:03:52.109> double<00:03:53.040> Moab<00:03:53.310> a<00:03:53.400> at<00:03:53.489> least<00:03:53.730> if<00:03:54.000> he

00:03:54.080 --> 00:03:54.090 
all that double Moab a at least if he

00:03:54.090 --> 00:03:56.960 
all that double Moab a at least if he
was<00:03:54.209> going<00:03:54.329> to<00:03:54.419> get<00:03:54.569> anything<00:03:54.810> in<00:03:55.109> it<00:03:55.730> so<00:03:56.730> I'm
