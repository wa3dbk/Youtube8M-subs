00:00:20.030 --> 00:00:20.040 
which has two huge cracks right

00:00:20.040 --> 00:00:23.220 
which has two huge cracks right
the<00:00:21.040> first<00:00:21.580> practice<00:00:22.180> has<00:00:22.450> approximately<00:00:23.080> dis

and<00:00:24.570> the<00:00:24.690> second<00:00:25.050> one<00:00:25.200> is<00:00:25.230> on

00:00:26.529 --> 00:00:26.539 
and the second one is on

00:00:26.539 --> 00:00:28.180 
and the second one is on
there<00:00:27.079> we<00:00:27.199> are

00:00:28.180 --> 00:00:28.190 
there we are

00:00:28.190 --> 00:00:33.810 
there we are
so<00:00:28.640> it<00:00:28.790> sounds<00:00:29.060> like<00:00:29.120> this

00:00:33.810 --> 00:00:33.820 

00:00:33.820 --> 00:00:37.660 

the<00:00:34.820> really<00:00:35.000> rattling<00:00:35.570> and<00:00:35.960> stuff<00:00:36.199> so<00:00:36.530> I<00:00:37.219> plan

00:00:37.660 --> 00:00:37.670 
the really rattling and stuff so I plan

00:00:37.670 --> 00:00:42.130 
the really rattling and stuff so I plan
to<00:00:37.699> cut<00:00:38.510> it<00:00:38.660> down<00:00:38.780> to<00:00:39.280> 10<00:00:40.280> inches<00:00:40.550> I<00:00:41.050> don't<00:00:42.050> know

00:00:42.130 --> 00:00:42.140 
to cut it down to 10 inches I don't know

00:00:42.140 --> 00:00:43.900 
to cut it down to 10 inches I don't know
eight<00:00:42.469> inches<00:00:42.739> i<00:00:42.860> don't<00:00:43.010> know<00:00:43.070> which<00:00:43.219> would<00:00:43.760> be

00:00:43.900 --> 00:00:43.910 
eight inches i don't know which would be

00:00:43.910 --> 00:00:46.540 
eight inches i don't know which would be
to<00:00:44.899> have<00:00:44.989> any<00:00:45.199> detectable<00:00:45.800> which<00:00:46.160> would<00:00:46.370> be

00:00:46.540 --> 00:00:46.550 
to have any detectable which would be

00:00:46.550 --> 00:00:49.990 
to have any detectable which would be
bell<00:00:46.820> i<00:00:47.620> may<00:00:48.620> be<00:00:48.680> to<00:00:48.890> put<00:00:49.039> some<00:00:49.219> systems<00:00:49.610> inside

00:00:49.990 --> 00:00:50.000 
bell i may be to put some systems inside

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:53.660 
bell i may be to put some systems inside
them<00:00:50.839> like<00:00:51.500> short<00:00:51.860> xn<00:00:52.339> with<00:00:52.519> sizzle

00:00:53.660 --> 00:00:53.670 
them like short xn with sizzle

00:00:53.670 --> 00:00:56.830 
them like short xn with sizzle
I<00:00:53.760> will<00:00:54.390> see<00:00:54.539> what<00:00:54.570> I<00:00:54.719> can<00:00:54.809> do<00:00:55.019> with<00:00:55.050> it<00:00:55.260> so

00:00:56.830 --> 00:00:56.840 
I will see what I can do with it so

00:00:56.840 --> 00:01:00.020 
I will see what I can do with it so
this<00:00:57.170> will<00:00:57.320> be<00:00:57.410> the<00:00:57.440> first<00:00:57.980> one

00:01:00.020 --> 00:01:00.030 
this will be the first one

00:01:00.030 --> 00:01:02.810 
this will be the first one
then<00:01:00.510> I<00:01:00.629> have<00:01:00.780> three<00:01:01.350> three<00:01:02.280> symbols<00:01:02.489> which<00:01:02.730> I

00:01:02.810 --> 00:01:02.820 
then I have three three symbols which I

00:01:02.820 --> 00:01:05.840 
then I have three three symbols which I
want<00:01:03.000> to<00:01:03.120> combine<00:01:03.329> so<00:01:04.250> the<00:01:05.250> first<00:01:05.460> one<00:01:05.640> this<00:01:05.790> is

00:01:05.840 --> 00:01:05.850 
want to combine so the first one this is

00:01:05.850 --> 00:01:09.680 
want to combine so the first one this is
an<00:01:06.090> old<00:01:06.869> symbol<00:01:07.790> from<00:01:08.790> Sabian<00:01:09.240> I<00:01:09.390> don't<00:01:09.630> know

00:01:09.680 --> 00:01:09.690

which brandon's it's the sabian sign on
the<00:01:12.210> back<00:01:12.330> but<00:01:12.960> I<00:01:12.990> don't<00:01:13.200> know<00:01:13.259> if<00:01:13.290> it's<00:01:13.500> a<00:01:13.680> a<00:01:13.710> ax

00:01:14.690 --> 00:01:14.700

00:01:20.660 --> 00:01:20.670 
stuff and it has a huge crack in here

00:01:20.670 --> 00:01:26.920 
stuff and it has a huge crack in here
and<00:01:20.880> sounds<00:01:21.750> like<00:01:21.810> this

00:01:26.920 --> 00:01:26.930

00:01:29.650 --> 00:01:29.660 
that's really dark and inspecting of

00:01:29.660 --> 00:01:33.670 
that's really dark and inspecting of
course<00:01:29.930> so<00:01:30.740> I<00:01:31.600> want<00:01:32.600> to<00:01:32.660> cut<00:01:32.840> it<00:01:32.960> down<00:01:32.990> to<00:01:33.350> 12

00:01:33.670 --> 00:01:33.680 
course so I want to cut it down to 12

00:01:33.680 --> 00:01:39.180 
course so I want to cut it down to 12
inches<00:01:34.090> approximately<00:01:35.090> well

00:01:39.180 --> 00:01:39.190 

00:01:39.190 --> 00:01:41.700 

this<00:01:39.790> symbol<00:01:40.180> as<00:01:40.330> well<00:01:40.690> to<00:01:40.900> 12<00:01:41.140> inches<00:01:41.290> this<00:01:41.650> is

00:01:41.700 --> 00:01:41.710 
this symbol as well to 12 inches this is

00:01:41.710 --> 00:01:44.640 
this symbol as well to 12 inches this is

and<00:01:46.680> the<00:01:47.680> owner<00:01:48.040> before<00:01:48.490> he<00:01:49.860> cut<00:01:50.860> it<00:01:50.980> down<00:01:51.070> to<00:01:51.130> I

00:01:51.360 --> 00:01:51.370 
and the owner before he cut it down to I

00:01:51.370 --> 00:01:53.760 
and the owner before he cut it down to I
don't<00:01:51.640> know<00:01:51.820> what<00:01:52.030> it<00:01:52.120> is<00:01:52.350> 15.5<00:01:53.350> inches

00:01:53.760 --> 00:01:53.770 
don't know what it is 15.5 inches

00:01:53.770 --> 00:01:55.340 
don't know what it is 15.5 inches
something<00:01:54.160> because<00:01:54.400> i<00:01:54.610> think<00:01:54.670> heather<00:01:54.970> gray

00:01:55.340 --> 00:01:55.350 
something because i think heather gray

00:01:55.350 --> 00:01:58.290 
something because i think heather gray
and<00:01:56.350> there<00:01:56.500> is<00:01:56.590> another<00:01:56.620> quake<00:01:57.070> which<00:01:57.340> is<00:01:57.490> this

00:01:58.290 --> 00:01:58.300 
and there is another quake which is this

00:01:58.300 --> 00:02:04.830 
and there is another quake which is this
length

00:02:04.830 --> 00:02:04.840 

00:02:04.840 --> 00:02:08.040 

and<00:02:05.200> not<00:02:05.890> that<00:02:06.189> could<00:02:06.880> crash<00:02:07.149> down<00:02:07.179> and<00:02:07.899> with

00:02:08.040 --> 00:02:08.050 
and not that could crash down and with

00:02:08.050 --> 00:02:12.240 
and not that could crash down and with
this<00:02:08.170> epic<00:02:08.649> crack<00:02:08.890> I<00:02:09.009> think<00:02:09.039> I<00:02:09.340> will

00:02:12.240 --> 00:02:12.250 

00:02:12.250 --> 00:02:14.100 

so<00:02:12.730> my<00:02:12.850> plans<00:02:13.120> for<00:02:13.270> this<00:02:13.390> is<00:02:13.570> to<00:02:13.810> cut<00:02:13.960> it<00:02:14.080> down

00:02:14.100 --> 00:02:14.110 
so my plans for this is to cut it down

00:02:14.110 --> 00:02:18.559 
so my plans for this is to cut it down
to<00:02:14.260> 12<00:02:14.590> inches<00:02:14.740> as<00:02:15.070> well

00:02:18.559 --> 00:02:18.569 

00:02:18.569 --> 00:02:21.559 

and<00:02:18.659> then<00:02:19.079> this<00:02:19.290> is<00:02:19.409> a<00:02:19.439> pace<00:02:19.769> 2002<00:02:20.640> crash

00:02:21.559 --> 00:02:21.569 
and then this is a pace 2002 crash

00:02:21.569 --> 00:02:25.160 
and then this is a pace 2002 crash
14-inch<00:02:22.280> which<00:02:23.280> has<00:02:23.519> had<00:02:24.209> a<00:02:24.510> huge<00:02:24.629> crack<00:02:24.959> which

00:02:25.160 --> 00:02:25.170 
14-inch which has had a huge crack which

00:02:25.170 --> 00:02:29.809 
14-inch which has had a huge crack which
was<00:02:25.319> not<00:02:26.129> very<00:02:26.370> professionally<00:02:27.120> cut<00:02:27.659> off

00:02:29.809 --> 00:02:29.819 
was not very professionally cut off

00:02:29.819 --> 00:02:32.839 
was not very professionally cut off
yeah<00:02:30.450> I<00:02:30.719> will<00:02:31.290> cut<00:02:31.499> it<00:02:31.620> down<00:02:31.859> to<00:02:31.920> 12<00:02:32.370> inches<00:02:32.549> as

00:02:32.839 --> 00:02:32.849 
yeah I will cut it down to 12 inches as

00:02:32.849 --> 00:02:35.149 
yeah I will cut it down to 12 inches as
a<00:02:32.969> while<00:02:33.120> so<00:02:33.420> I<00:02:33.450> have<00:02:33.749> three<00:02:34.290> symbols<00:02:34.560> those

00:02:35.149 --> 00:02:35.159 
a while so I have three symbols those

00:02:46.559 --> 00:02:46.569 
and out of those three symbols i want to

00:02:46.569 --> 00:02:54.020 
and out of those three symbols i want to
i<00:02:46.600> need<00:02:47.170> to<00:02:48.540> show<00:02:49.540> you<00:02:49.600> this<00:02:49.750> how<00:02:49.930> it's<00:02:50.080> on

symbols which I showed you right now I
want<00:03:08.470> to<00:03:08.500> produce<00:03:08.709> a<00:03:09.159> hoop<00:03:09.579> pressure<00:03:09.909> which

00:03:10.259 --> 00:03:10.269 
want to produce a hoop pressure which

00:03:10.269 --> 00:03:13.949 
want to produce a hoop pressure which
was<00:03:10.450> introduced<00:03:10.900> by<00:03:10.959> Savyon<00:03:12.569> which<00:03:13.569> has<00:03:13.930> a

00:03:24.680 --> 00:03:24.690 
first the bottom ring is really heavy

00:03:24.690 --> 00:03:27.590 
first the bottom ring is really heavy
and<00:03:24.840> then<00:03:25.110> you<00:03:25.200> have<00:03:25.320> light<00:03:25.980> lighter<00:03:26.700> rings<00:03:27.450> on

00:03:31.640 --> 00:03:31.650 
this rattling sound of those of those

00:03:31.650 --> 00:03:33.350 
this rattling sound of those of those
hoops<00:03:31.860> and<00:03:32.160> they<00:03:32.250> won't<00:03:32.610> fall<00:03:32.790> off<00:03:32.850> it<00:03:33.150> was

00:03:33.350 --> 00:03:33.360 
hoops and they won't fall off it was

00:03:33.360 --> 00:03:35.140 
hoops and they won't fall off it was
really<00:03:33.570> heavy<00:03:33.840> and<00:03:34.050> you<00:03:34.590> have<00:03:34.680> white<00:03:34.920> noise

00:03:35.140 --> 00:03:35.150 
really heavy and you have white noise

00:03:35.150 --> 00:03:38.840 
really heavy and you have white noise
electronics<00:03:36.150> are<00:03:36.360> one<00:03:36.570> so<00:03:36.750> i<00:03:36.780> will<00:03:37.050> use<00:03:37.730> for<00:03:38.730> my

00:03:38.840 --> 00:03:38.850 
electronics are one so i will use for my

00:03:38.850 --> 00:03:42.540 
electronics are one so i will use for my
drum<00:03:39.390> and<00:03:39.510> bass<00:03:40.310> sets

00:03:42.540 --> 00:03:42.550 
drum and bass sets

00:03:42.550 --> 00:03:44.460 
drum and bass sets
you<00:03:43.030> have<00:03:43.120> to<00:03:43.240> produce<00:03:43.510> new<00:03:43.720> assemble

00:03:44.460 --> 00:03:44.470 
you have to produce new assemble

00:03:44.470 --> 00:03:48.030 
you have to produce new assemble
sausages<00:03:44.860> at<00:03:45.190> symbol<00:03:45.970> or<00:03:46.510> this<00:03:46.810> pressure<00:03:47.770> is

00:03:48.030 --> 00:03:48.040 
sausages at symbol or this pressure is

00:03:48.040 --> 00:03:51.520 
sausages at symbol or this pressure is
really<00:03:48.310> expensive<00:03:48.490> I<00:03:48.940> guess

00:03:51.520 --> 00:03:51.530 

00:03:51.530 --> 00:03:55.630 

web<00:03:52.160> stuff<00:03:52.760> I<00:03:53.000> can<00:03:53.500> produce<00:03:54.500> them<00:03:54.860> can<00:03:55.459> produce

00:03:55.630 --> 00:03:55.640 
web stuff I can produce them can produce

00:03:55.640 --> 00:03:58.090 
web stuff I can produce them can produce
it<00:03:55.880> I<00:03:56.090> guess<00:03:56.390> and<00:03:56.660> because<00:03:57.170> i<00:03:57.290> use<00:03:57.530> a<00:03:57.560> 12-inch

00:03:58.090 --> 00:03:58.100 
it I guess and because i use a 12-inch

00:03:58.100 --> 00:03:59.800 
it I guess and because i use a 12-inch
snare<00:03:58.370> and<00:03:58.610> the<00:03:58.640> suit<00:03:59.300> pressure<00:03:59.480> is<00:03:59.690> not

00:03:59.800 --> 00:03:59.810 
snare and the suit pressure is not

00:03:59.810 --> 00:04:01.750 
snare and the suit pressure is not
available<00:04:00.050> as<00:04:00.319> in<00:04:00.680> 12<00:04:00.950> inch<00:04:01.190> so<00:04:01.370> it<00:04:01.430> would<00:04:01.640> be

00:04:01.750 --> 00:04:01.760 
available as in 12 inch so it would be

00:04:01.760 --> 00:04:04.520 
available as in 12 inch so it would be
really<00:04:02.180> nice<00:04:02.390> thing<00:04:02.630> I<00:04:02.840> guess

00:04:04.520 --> 00:04:04.530 
really nice thing I guess

00:04:04.530 --> 00:04:07.430 
really nice thing I guess
yeah<00:04:05.100> then<00:04:05.490> I<00:04:05.580> have<00:04:05.700> those<00:04:05.870> symbols<00:04:06.870> cut<00:04:07.050> off<00:04:07.230> I

00:04:07.430 --> 00:04:07.440 
yeah then I have those symbols cut off I

00:04:07.440 --> 00:04:11.540 
yeah then I have those symbols cut off I
cut<00:04:07.740> I<00:04:08.040> cut<00:04:08.490> one<00:04:08.520> ring<00:04:08.910> off<00:04:09.690> and<00:04:10.200> then<00:04:10.620> i<00:04:10.740> will
