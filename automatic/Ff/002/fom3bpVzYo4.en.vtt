when<00:00:10.410> I<00:00:10.440> think<00:00:10.679> of<00:00:10.769> coach<00:00:10.980> wouldn't<00:00:11.309> I<00:00:11.340> think

00:00:11.360 --> 00:00:11.370 
when I think of coach wouldn't I think

00:00:11.370 --> 00:00:12.890 
when I think of coach wouldn't I think
of<00:00:11.639> a<00:00:11.700> number<00:00:11.969> of<00:00:12.059> different<00:00:12.389> things<00:00:12.509> number

00:00:12.890 --> 00:00:12.900 
of a number of different things number

00:00:12.900 --> 00:00:14.629 
of a number of different things number
of<00:00:12.990> words<00:00:13.500> and<00:00:13.740> descriptions<00:00:13.830> that<00:00:14.400> he

exemplifies come to mind

00:00:16.109 --> 00:00:19.070 
exemplifies come to mind
I<00:00:16.230> think<00:00:16.800> of<00:00:16.920> fundamentals<00:00:17.810> he<00:00:18.810> was<00:00:18.960> the

00:00:19.070 --> 00:00:19.080 
I think of fundamentals he was the

00:00:19.080 --> 00:00:21.470 
I think of fundamentals he was the
ultimate<00:00:19.250> fundamental<00:00:20.250> teacher<00:00:20.520> we<00:00:21.060> started

NCAA<00:00:25.130> finals<00:00:26.130> the<00:00:26.970> practice<00:00:27.420> before<00:00:27.570> hand<00:00:27.990> we

00:00:28.130 --> 00:00:28.140 
NCAA finals the practice before hand we

00:00:28.140 --> 00:00:30.560 
NCAA finals the practice before hand we
were<00:00:28.289> still<00:00:28.590> doing<00:00:28.949> those<00:00:29.460> same<00:00:29.760> fundamentals

00:00:30.560 --> 00:00:30.570 
were still doing those same fundamentals

00:00:30.570 --> 00:00:32.089

that<00:00:30.630> we<00:00:30.840> started<00:00:31.230> the<00:00:31.380> first<00:00:31.590> day<00:00:31.920> of

00:00:32.089 --> 00:00:32.099 
that we started the first day of

00:00:32.099 --> 00:00:34.760 
that we started the first day of
practice<00:00:32.340> way<00:00:33.180> back<00:00:33.390> when<00:00:33.660> the<00:00:34.350> first<00:00:34.559> thing

00:00:34.760 --> 00:00:34.770 
practice way back when the first thing

00:00:34.770 --> 00:00:36.170 
practice way back when the first thing
he<00:00:34.920> did<00:00:35.070> was<00:00:35.250> he<00:00:35.370> taught<00:00:35.550> us<00:00:35.579> how<00:00:35.700> to<00:00:35.820> put<00:00:36.030> our

00:00:36.170 --> 00:00:36.180 
he did was he taught us how to put our

00:00:36.180 --> 00:00:38.450 
he did was he taught us how to put our
socks<00:00:36.510> on<00:00:36.780> properly<00:00:37.380> so<00:00:38.010> we<00:00:38.129> didn't<00:00:38.370> get

00:00:38.450 --> 00:00:38.460 
socks on properly so we didn't get

00:00:38.460 --> 00:00:39.860 
socks on properly so we didn't get
blisters<00:00:38.730> so<00:00:39.090> we<00:00:39.210> wouldn't<00:00:39.450> miss<00:00:39.570> a<00:00:39.629> practice

00:00:39.860 --> 00:00:39.870 
blisters so we wouldn't miss a practice

00:00:39.870 --> 00:00:43.160 
blisters so we wouldn't miss a practice
or<00:00:40.260> miss<00:00:40.379> a<00:00:40.410> game<00:00:40.649> because<00:00:41.040> of<00:00:41.190> that<00:00:41.309> I<00:00:42.170> think

00:00:43.160 --> 00:00:43.170 
or miss a game because of that I think

00:00:43.170 --> 00:00:46.760 
or miss a game because of that I think
of<00:00:43.530> teacher<00:00:44.059> he<00:00:45.059> most<00:00:45.629> preferred<00:00:46.110> teacher<00:00:46.440> as
