00:00:11.420 --> 00:00:16.830
 hello very good today we are going to play at 

00:00:13.880 --> 00:00:18.840
 game of thrones and intrigue in the west 

00:00:16.830 --> 00:00:21.029
 another game intrigues us west is a 

00:00:18.840 --> 00:00:22.810
 Card game is very fast from 2 to 6 

00:00:21.029 --> 00:00:24.789
 players 

00:00:22.810 --> 00:00:26.380
 and it's played in a quarter of an hour or 

00:00:24.789 --> 00:00:28.720
 even less serious that is a very game 

00:00:26.380 --> 00:00:30.720
 fast I teach some components 

00:00:28.720 --> 00:00:32.780
 and how to play 

00:00:30.720 --> 00:00:35.190
 the game are the cards that you have here 

00:00:32.780 --> 00:00:37.290
 and some counters that are to indicate 

00:00:35.190 --> 00:00:39.930
 the penalties and basically the 

00:00:37.290 --> 00:00:42.690
 letters are from the four types of houses 

00:00:39.930 --> 00:00:45.059
 as I teach you the unboxing that are 

00:00:42.690 --> 00:00:47.610
 all equal of differentiated agreement 

00:00:45.059 --> 00:00:49.710
 in the four colors and then there are the 

00:00:47.610 --> 00:00:51.690
 letters of the iron throne that are the 

00:00:49.710 --> 00:00:53.510
 rewards that will be given to the last 

00:00:51.690 --> 00:00:57.240
 colo player that the last card 

00:00:53.510 --> 00:01:00.450
 so how do you play 

00:00:57.240 --> 00:01:03.720
 all the letters are formed are mixed and 

00:01:00.450 --> 00:01:05.370
 a general mallet is formed and according to 

00:01:03.720 --> 00:01:07.560
 number of players because it is distributed to 

00:01:05.370 --> 00:01:09.570
 each player a certain number in 

00:01:07.560 --> 00:01:12.450
 a game of 2 players are shared 

00:01:09.570 --> 00:01:14.730
 14 cards for each character in one of 

00:01:12.450 --> 00:01:17.250
 3 players steal 12 cards in one of 

00:01:14.730 --> 00:01:20.100
 4 players a 9 in one of 5 are 7 for 

00:01:17.250 --> 00:01:22.710
 each one and one of 6 players are robbed 6 

00:01:20.100 --> 00:01:25.570
 cards per character then the game 

00:01:22.710 --> 00:01:27.850
 is to create a pyramid 

00:01:25.570 --> 00:01:30.340
 the first good player they play so many 

00:01:27.850 --> 00:01:32.860
 rounds as numerous players have and 

00:01:30.340 --> 00:01:34.900
 in each round will be a box player 

00:01:32.860 --> 00:01:36.070
 initial then in a game of 4 

00:01:34.900 --> 00:01:37.950
 players will play four rounds 

00:01:36.070 --> 00:01:39.729
 being each of the four players 

00:01:37.950 --> 00:01:42.880
 at least once 

00:01:39.729 --> 00:01:44.950
 the first then you steal the cards 

00:01:42.880 --> 00:01:46.479
 you have to start the game and the 

00:01:44.950 --> 00:01:48.670
 first player always has to place 

00:01:46.479 --> 00:01:50.320
 a letter in the central position of 

00:01:48.670 --> 00:01:52.450
 board at the base of the pyramid of 

00:01:50.320 --> 00:01:55.420
 agreement the base of the pyramid can 

00:01:52.450 --> 00:01:58.000
 hold up to eight cards if played 

00:01:55.420 --> 00:02:00.640
 two players there will only be a maximum of 

00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:03.100
 seven the next player will have to 

00:02:00.640 --> 00:02:05.590
 touching a letter and you can put a 

00:02:03.100 --> 00:02:08.080
 letter either to the right or to the 

00:02:05.590 --> 00:02:10.149
 left following the clock then 

00:02:08.080 --> 00:02:12.010
 let's say you choose to put it to the 

00:02:10.149 --> 00:02:14.620
 left then it would touch the next 

00:02:12.010 --> 00:02:17.560
 player and now there would be another option the 

00:02:14.620 --> 00:02:19.810
 could put to the right the could 

00:02:17.560 --> 00:02:21.580
 put to the left never could 

00:02:19.810 --> 00:02:25.900
 put in the middle of two letters is 

00:02:21.580 --> 00:02:27.940
 impossible but could place it above 

00:02:25.900 --> 00:02:29.319
 agreement would be like a pyramid and how 

00:02:27.940 --> 00:02:32.499
 open 

00:02:29.319 --> 00:02:35.499
 of two cards I could mount it on top 

00:02:32.499 --> 00:02:37.359
 then how can you ride it over 

00:02:35.499 --> 00:02:39.310
 to mount it on the requirement is 

00:02:37.359 --> 00:02:41.139
 that the letter you are going to write is from 

00:02:39.310 --> 00:02:43.180
 Same color as at least one of the two 

00:02:41.139 --> 00:02:45.639
 streets below is in this case 

00:02:43.180 --> 00:02:48.549
 I would have to put a stark cake if 

00:02:45.639 --> 00:02:51.519
 On the contrary, this was the 

00:02:48.549 --> 00:02:56.390
 combination or you could put this 

00:02:51.519 --> 00:02:58.450
 letter or I could put this letter 

00:02:56.390 --> 00:03:00.810
 so 

00:02:58.450 --> 00:03:03.849
 of course there may be pyramids 

00:03:00.810 --> 00:03:06.330
 successive if the game continues to advance and 

00:03:03.849 --> 00:03:09.370
 they are placing letters to the sides 

00:03:06.330 --> 00:03:11.349
 here it would have been for another for another 

00:03:09.370 --> 00:03:13.030
 pyramid and the same with a black cake 

00:03:11.349 --> 00:03:14.830
 or a red letter because you have to 

00:03:13.030 --> 00:03:16.269
 match the ones below 

00:03:14.830 --> 00:03:18.550
 remember you can never put letters 

00:03:16.269 --> 00:03:20.410
 in between and always have to put 

00:03:18.550 --> 00:03:24.760
 on the left 

00:03:20.410 --> 00:03:26.830
 or to the right or above fulfilling those 

00:03:24.760 --> 00:03:28.840
 conditions there will be some time when 

00:03:26.830 --> 00:03:30.160
 a player can not put cards in that 

00:03:28.840 --> 00:03:32.560
 moment that the player can not put 

00:03:30.160 --> 00:03:34.900
 letters will be eliminated and directly 

00:03:32.560 --> 00:03:36.430
 your turn then it will run and go 

00:03:34.900 --> 00:03:38.860
 playing the other players until no 

00:03:36.430 --> 00:03:40.990
 they want to put letters this makes possible 

00:03:38.860 --> 00:03:43.060
 that in the last turn of a player if 

00:03:40.990 --> 00:03:45.910
 the rest are eliminated he can put 

00:03:43.060 --> 00:03:47.260
 more cards during your turn according 

00:03:45.910 --> 00:03:50.350
 like being the last play of the 

00:03:47.260 --> 00:03:52.540
 He left and he could and could put 

00:03:50.350 --> 00:03:54.580
 for example to a letter here I could 

00:03:52.540 --> 00:03:56.410
 with another letter here would discard 

00:03:54.580 --> 00:03:59.050
 as many letters as I could until I was 

00:03:56.410 --> 00:04:03.150
 removed and once they are all 

00:03:59.050 --> 00:04:03.150
 players eliminated the round ends 

00:04:03.819 --> 00:04:09.519
 when the round ends the last player 

00:04:06.760 --> 00:04:11.739
 who has put a letter will receive a 

00:04:09.519 --> 00:04:14.170
 letter of the iron throne at random 

00:04:11.739 --> 00:04:15.969
 agree to steal a letter from the throne to 

00:04:14.170 --> 00:04:20.470
 iron the letters of the iron throne 

00:04:15.969 --> 00:04:24.310
 they have the values minus one minus two and 

00:04:20.470 --> 00:04:26.800
 minus three that are subtracting at the end of 

00:04:24.310 --> 00:04:28.389
 the game because I say it's subtract because 

00:04:26.800 --> 00:04:29.770
 when a player is eliminated it is 

00:04:28.389 --> 00:04:31.720
 likely to have letters in his hand 

00:04:29.770 --> 00:04:34.270
 Could not play then then 

00:04:31.720 --> 00:04:36.009
 have to catch so many points of 

00:04:34.270 --> 00:04:37.960
 counters like letters have stayed 

00:04:36.009 --> 00:04:39.490
 in the hand if they have been five 

00:04:37.960 --> 00:04:41.710
 cards in your hand because you will catch a 

00:04:39.490 --> 00:04:43.570
 five-point counter if you see him in 

00:04:41.710 --> 00:04:47.270
 every two then a two point counter 

00:04:43.570 --> 00:04:49.190
 and so on 

00:04:47.270 --> 00:04:51.440
 at the end of the game then it 

00:04:49.190 --> 00:04:53.840
 all points are counted and 

00:04:51.440 --> 00:04:55.160
 subtract the points that take away the 

00:04:53.840 --> 00:04:57.580
 iron throne letters that's why 

00:04:55.160 --> 00:04:59.590
 it is always 

00:04:57.580 --> 00:05:01.720
 It is therefore important to finish the last 

00:04:59.590 --> 00:05:03.789
 because you are going to have less together the 

00:05:01.720 --> 00:05:05.800
 player who has the least points wins the 

00:05:03.789 --> 00:05:08.319
 departure in case there are two 

00:05:05.800 --> 00:05:08.979
 players with fewer points with the 

00:05:08.319 --> 00:05:11.560
 same points 

00:05:08.979 --> 00:05:13.810
 the player who accumulates less swords 

00:05:11.560 --> 00:05:15.699
 all the cards of the game of the throne of 

00:05:13.810 --> 00:05:18.219
 iron have swords the player who 

00:05:15.699 --> 00:05:19.500
 accumulate less spades is the winner 

00:05:18.219 --> 00:05:22.000
 in case of a tie, they will have won 

00:05:19.500 --> 00:05:25.810
 now he will win both 

00:05:22.000 --> 00:05:30.670
 and as you can see is the game does not have what 

00:05:25.810 --> 00:05:32.230
 has more simply that the main 

00:05:30.670 --> 00:05:33.940
 already agreed is to place an offer 

00:05:32.230 --> 00:05:35.830
 timely and the restrictions are not 

00:05:33.940 --> 00:05:37.090
 can put between the characters little 

00:05:35.830 --> 00:05:38.620
 on the left you can put the 

00:05:37.090 --> 00:05:40.150
 right can be put up forming 

00:05:38.620 --> 00:05:42.010
 a pyramid with the requirement that 

00:05:40.150 --> 00:05:45.040
 the letter below has to be like 

00:05:42.010 --> 00:05:47.530
 minimum one of the same color forming the 

00:05:45.040 --> 00:05:51.430
 pyramid and the base of the pyramid of 

00:05:47.530 --> 00:05:53.890
 three players to six is ​​up to eight 

00:05:51.430 --> 00:05:57.090
 long cards and with two players you 

00:05:53.890 --> 00:05:59.410
 reduces to seven so nothing that's 

00:05:57.090 --> 00:06:01.090
 game of thrones imposing intrigue a 

00:05:59.410 --> 00:06:03.760
 little that is played very fast a game of 

00:06:01.090 --> 00:06:05.530
 letters that is very tiny as you see 

00:06:03.760 --> 00:06:09.160
 that can be taken anywhere and 

00:06:05.530 --> 00:06:12.880
 you can play in a very short time 

00:06:09.160 --> 00:06:14.770
 so that will make a review on the blog 

00:06:12.880 --> 00:06:17.490
 of what the game looks like 

00:06:14.770 --> 00:06:20.510
 I think about him and 

00:06:17.490 --> 00:06:23.180
 you will see the opinion if you want 

00:06:20.510 --> 00:06:25.580
 so nothing to have fun and I already 

00:06:23.180 --> 00:06:28.600
 comment what do you think if you like it or not 

00:06:25.580 --> 00:06:28.600
 greetings see you later
