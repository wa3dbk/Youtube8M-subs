00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.280
 So it may be worthwhile to rappel others but at least to do so 

00:00:03.280 --> 00:00:06.420
 Bad Cannstatt injured the Haller market of Uli at the last tee 

00:00:06.420 --> 00:00:11.269
 Frightening her end of the game, Vikar's console is a console that's been in 

00:00:11.269 --> 00:00:12.879
 nine years later 

00:00:12.879 --> 00:00:15.459
 sounds a bit strange why does he do that 

00:00:15.459 --> 00:00:18.220
 more so, we are there but already 

00:00:18.220 --> 00:00:22.500
 old bids and from the engine for new sails Winter games Penta may though 

00:00:22.500 --> 00:00:27.000
 also in the house but mainly the commissioned work will be the weir of 

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:28.039
 Get Merck Serono 

00:00:28.039 --> 00:00:30.039
 to do more with the euro 

00:00:30.039 --> 00:00:31.699
 who five years ago 

00:00:31.699 --> 00:00:35.640
 Five friends just thought that Pinka's goal is one 

00:00:35.640 --> 00:00:39.910
 terrific console and we could not understand why Zier was pulped 

00:00:39.910 --> 00:00:42.910
 she really became one of the industry 

00:00:43.810 --> 00:00:47.290
 who dropped like hot potatoes all just because of percent 

00:00:47.290 --> 00:00:50.290
 five political source purely internal 

00:00:50.290 --> 00:00:53.430
 We wonder why this can be his and want the console 

00:00:53.430 --> 00:00:57.380
 continue to provide games and I mean our motto so the 

00:00:57.380 --> 00:01:00.930
 Platforms can never be too old and percent 

00:01:00.930 --> 00:01:05.170
 Never be too unfamiliar than that you could still get new players for Intel 

00:01:05.170 --> 00:01:08.850
 Big fans of the coffers said the contract must go on exactly the same 

00:01:08.850 --> 00:01:11.390
 he now a kind of next day 

00:01:11.390 --> 00:01:14.520
 Nadine Müller we previously saw a post about Apple 

00:01:15.090 --> 00:01:20.680
 Metal is currently a company that is precise large is also 

00:01:20.680 --> 00:01:23.990
 because of their lawyer also let image with it 

00:01:23.990 --> 00:01:29.630
 We are still complaining about it "and I think that we will not 

00:01:29.630 --> 00:01:33.340
 can and we do not want to be with it because it's obvious anyway 

00:01:33.340 --> 00:01:37.630
 because we always talk to people he's in this scene anyway 

00:01:37.630 --> 00:01:40.950
 in there are a bit more than that, that is true, although traces 

00:01:40.950 --> 00:01:44.240
 but on the whole we do not press too much on the on the 

00:01:44.240 --> 00:01:45.310
 DOSB commission 

00:01:45.310 --> 00:01:47.940
 saved his rights to the act very seriously 

00:01:47.940 --> 00:01:51.280
 it's still worth living for yourself 

00:01:51.280 --> 00:01:54.770
 Well, you have to live on it already that's all right 

00:01:54.770 --> 00:01:58.890
 So it is already Madlener border I have to say quite honestly with good and 

00:01:58.890 --> 00:02:02.780
 Promos you already get the sales rooms of only one Methler people 

00:02:02.780 --> 00:02:06.180
 pass as to the Xbox Live Arcade 

00:02:06.180 --> 00:02:10.110
 but then, in the end, it is still a console the number many people 

00:02:10.110 --> 00:02:11.519
 has all the fans 

00:02:11.519 --> 00:02:15.980
 but still big publishers would turn away from it because he 

00:02:15.980 --> 00:02:20.370
 say so I can not keep a company alive from SAS as well 

00:02:20.370 --> 00:02:23.979
 hard but we are few people we have a lot around 

00:02:24.989 --> 00:02:28.859
 in the overview and can then actually get along quite well 

00:02:28.859 --> 00:02:33.209
 yes and a new project has put a lot of heart and has said so 

00:02:33.209 --> 00:02:37.299
 It's almost top-notch right now, but that's exactly what we have now 

00:02:37.299 --> 00:02:39.110
 for six years at a game 

00:02:39.110 --> 00:02:42.110
 get the 90 storm wind you see 

00:02:42.110 --> 00:02:45.860
 This has been developed by just one Baden-Württemberg two-man team 

00:02:45.860 --> 00:02:47.769
 Duran with takings 

00:02:47.769 --> 00:02:49.119
 and we 

00:02:49.119 --> 00:02:53.579
 have already shown it to the public for the very first time 

00:02:53.579 --> 00:02:56.789
 Percent - now begins with this broadcast with this charisma 

00:02:57.299 --> 00:03:01.459
 now also the pre-order for one the one under www wuerzburg Gentz ​​point 

00:03:01.459 --> 00:03:02.569
 com / shop 

00:03:02.569 --> 00:03:06.419
 since he can sing to himself and also explain what we do all new 

00:03:06.419 --> 00:03:10.459
 rated Christmassy time since he could imagine the age 

00:03:10.459 --> 00:03:13.249
 Games cases could be so classic again 

00:03:13.249 --> 00:03:17.249
 The game master solves these systems unesco list success of these old ones 

00:03:17.249 --> 00:03:18.469
 Principles and I would 

00:03:18.469 --> 00:03:19.899
 even claim themselves 

00:03:19.899 --> 00:03:22.899
 the s5 in Kaarst in the release 

00:03:24.419 --> 00:03:28.010
 a unique effects and animations like the horse Equus 

00:03:28.010 --> 00:03:29.619
 can defy 

00:03:29.619 --> 00:03:33.859
 we've become that ore that's always relatively over o2 we've already got it 

00:03:33.859 --> 00:03:36.180
 the retro still no foreign word 

00:03:36.180 --> 00:03:39.269
 I think so 

00:03:39.269 --> 00:03:43.449
 History of the whole anchors that old stuff now too 

00:03:43.449 --> 00:03:46.040
 with the flooding the moon the one 

00:03:46.040 --> 00:03:49.490
 World in quotes that gets more interesting 

00:03:50.279 --> 00:03:53.469
