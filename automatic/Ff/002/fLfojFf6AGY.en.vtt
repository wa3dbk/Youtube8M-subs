it<00:00:56.579> in<00:00:56.640> a<00:00:56.670> way<00:00:56.820> that<00:00:56.850> lets<00:00:57.600> just<00:00:57.840> say<00:00:57.989> you<00:00:58.050> can

00:00:58.310 --> 00:00:58.320 
it in a way that lets just say you can

00:00:58.320 --> 00:01:01.040 
it in a way that lets just say you can
automatically<00:00:58.920> record<00:00:59.879> what<00:01:00.480> you<00:01:00.629> streamed

00:01:01.040 --> 00:01:01.050 
automatically record what you streamed

00:01:01.050 --> 00:01:02.750 
automatically record what you streamed
and<00:01:01.320> then<00:01:01.530> he'll<00:01:01.770> have<00:01:02.039> an<00:01:02.280> interface<00:01:02.460> where

00:01:02.750 --> 00:01:02.760 
and then he'll have an interface where

00:01:02.760 --> 00:01:04.490 
and then he'll have an interface where
you<00:01:02.789> can<00:01:02.850> cut<00:01:03.210> it<00:01:03.239> up<00:01:03.420> inside<00:01:03.780> of<00:01:03.960> YouTube<00:01:04.049> and

00:01:04.490 --> 00:01:04.500 
you can cut it up inside of YouTube and

00:01:04.500 --> 00:01:06.350 
you can cut it up inside of YouTube and
then<00:01:05.070> it's<00:01:05.220> already<00:01:05.519> there<00:01:05.700> and<00:01:05.760> it's<00:01:06.060> easier

00:01:06.350 --> 00:01:06.360 
then it's already there and it's easier

00:01:06.360 --> 00:01:08.240 
then it's already there and it's easier
easier<00:01:06.540> to<00:01:06.750> process<00:01:06.990> and<00:01:07.320> upload<00:01:07.560> oh<00:01:07.770> my<00:01:08.100> god

00:01:08.240 --> 00:01:08.250

00:01:38.790 --> 00:01:41.030 
whatever they do though they're trying
to<00:01:38.820> do<00:01:38.939> put<00:01:39.329> there<00:01:39.600> okay<00:01:40.049> then<00:01:40.470> then<00:01:40.799> yeah<00:01:41.009> I

to do put there okay then then yeah I
mean<00:01:41.280> I<00:01:41.340> think<00:01:41.430> it<00:01:41.670> just<00:01:41.700> makes<00:01:42.000> sense<00:01:42.090> for

00:01:42.440 --> 00:01:42.450 
mean I think it just makes sense for

00:01:42.450 --> 00:01:45.139 
mean I think it just makes sense for
YouTube<00:01:42.869> to<00:01:43.020> do<00:01:43.140> it<00:01:43.320> i<00:01:43.350> mean<00:01:43.560> i<00:01:44.250> really<00:01:44.670> do<00:01:45.000> as

00:01:45.139 --> 00:01:45.149 
YouTube to do it i mean i really do as

00:01:45.149 --> 00:01:46.490 
YouTube to do it i mean i really do as
long<00:01:45.270> as<00:01:45.450> i<00:01:45.509> do<00:01:45.570> it<00:01:45.720> right<00:01:45.840> I<00:01:45.869> really<00:01:46.110> do<00:01:46.320> think

00:01:46.490 --> 00:01:46.500 
long as i do it right I really do think

00:01:46.500 --> 00:01:48.020 
long as i do it right I really do think
that<00:01:46.619> they<00:01:46.829> put<00:01:47.070> twitch<00:01:47.280> out<00:01:47.520> because<00:01:47.850> it's

00:01:48.020 --> 00:01:48.030 
that they put twitch out because it's

00:01:48.030 --> 00:01:50.780 
that they put twitch out because it's
just<00:01:48.299> did<00:01:49.229> so<00:01:49.860> many<00:01:49.979> people<00:01:50.340> I<00:01:50.549> know<00:01:50.610> would

00:01:50.780 --> 00:01:50.790 
just did so many people I know would

00:01:50.790 --> 00:01:52.490 
just did so many people I know would
just<00:01:51.180> make<00:01:51.299> youtube<00:01:51.630> their<00:01:51.840> homepage<00:01:52.290> and

00:01:52.490 --> 00:01:52.500 
just make youtube their homepage and

00:01:52.500 --> 00:01:54.950 
just make youtube their homepage and
done<00:01:52.710> yeah<00:01:53.090> well<00:01:54.090> that's<00:01:54.299> the<00:01:54.390> internet<00:01:54.810> one

00:01:54.950 --> 00:01:54.960 
done yeah well that's the internet one

00:01:54.960 --> 00:01:56.690 
done yeah well that's the internet one
of<00:01:55.049> the<00:01:55.110> reasons<00:01:55.439> I<00:01:55.500> don't<00:01:55.710> I<00:01:55.920> don't<00:01:56.280> let<00:01:56.610> they

00:01:56.690 --> 00:01:56.700 
of the reasons I don't I don't let they

00:01:56.700 --> 00:01:58.639 
of the reasons I don't I don't let they
don't<00:01:56.850> use<00:01:57.149> it<00:01:57.270> but<00:01:57.390> I<00:01:57.570> think<00:01:58.049> having<00:01:58.290> a<00:01:58.469> whole

00:01:58.639 --> 00:01:58.649 
don't use it but I think having a whole

00:01:58.649 --> 00:02:00.770 
don't use it but I think having a whole
separate<00:01:58.979> interface<00:01:59.250> turns<00:01:59.729> me<00:01:59.939> off<00:01:59.969> that

00:02:00.770 --> 00:02:00.780 
separate interface turns me off that

00:02:00.780 --> 00:02:03.200 
separate interface turns me off that
