00:00:11.030 --> 00:00:16.920
 Nine people today I'll show you the 

00:00:13.770 --> 00:00:19.080
 snapshot 12 9 30 h and this one offers 

00:00:16.920 --> 00:00:20.960
 not much new and not much 

00:00:19.080 --> 00:00:27.800
 Worth seeing I do it anyway and 

00:00:20.960 --> 00:00:30.869
 have fun it starts with the sound 

00:00:27.800 --> 00:00:33.750
 somehow the way house sounds 

00:00:30.869 --> 00:00:36.660
 and place one again added like 

00:00:33.750 --> 00:00:38.400
 you old ones were just the running sounds 

00:00:36.660 --> 00:00:40.740
 it has remained the same 

00:00:38.400 --> 00:00:42.780
 the only one not the real one 

00:00:40.740 --> 00:00:44.610
 I only found out by accident that 

00:00:42.780 --> 00:00:49.130
 actually in this slapshot is that 

00:00:44.610 --> 00:00:51.030
 light from this angular thing up there 

00:00:49.130 --> 00:00:53.580
 no not from the sun but that 

00:00:51.030 --> 00:00:55.230
 light in general it is the most light 

00:00:53.580 --> 00:00:58.440
 bugs have been fixed as you can see here 

00:00:55.230 --> 00:01:01.640
 can in this beautiful mountain bio so 

00:00:58.440 --> 00:01:04.019
 no light field and no generation 

00:01:01.640 --> 00:01:07.140
 behaves as you can see here 

00:01:04.019 --> 00:01:09.840
 no case no piece somehow missing 

00:01:07.140 --> 00:01:10.830
 no, but it's about the light and here 

00:01:09.840 --> 00:01:13.110
 you can see that the light is actually 

00:01:10.830 --> 00:01:15.660
 honestly no light fans have more there 

00:01:13.110 --> 00:01:19.320
 down in the cave what's going on there 

00:01:15.660 --> 00:01:21.420
 There are no fans and that's what they think 

00:01:19.320 --> 00:01:22.920
 I'm really cool on the side 

00:01:21.420 --> 00:01:25.260
 someday hughes 

00:01:22.920 --> 00:01:26.940
 lightning but somehow I do not have 

00:01:25.260 --> 00:01:28.340
 I really have a difference 

00:01:26.940 --> 00:01:30.770
 not any real difference 

00:01:28.340 --> 00:01:32.490
 can also make manufactured 

00:01:30.770 --> 00:01:37.260
 light conditions in the dark 

00:01:32.490 --> 00:01:40.310
 but also were dingens here 

00:01:37.260 --> 00:01:42.780
 blocks eg stair and half steps 

00:01:40.310 --> 00:01:45.560
 synonymous gefixed that really 

00:01:42.780 --> 00:01:48.510
 not translucent as you times 

00:01:45.560 --> 00:01:50.659
 16,000 times theme and how nice everyone 

00:01:48.510 --> 00:01:53.340
 can see that even lights right 

00:01:50.659 --> 00:01:56.130
 comes through and I believe that even 

00:01:53.340 --> 00:01:58.890
 if there are two and less if it is 

00:01:56.130 --> 00:02:02.150
 one is and jo 

00:01:58.890 --> 00:02:04.380
 that is honestly not the only thing 

00:02:02.150 --> 00:02:06.630
 see this snapshot for 

00:02:04.380 --> 00:02:09.300
 otherwise everything is fixed only on bugfix 

00:02:06.630 --> 00:02:11.580
 those of other snapshots were in 

00:02:09.300 --> 00:02:15.120
 this snapshot is all about light 

00:02:11.580 --> 00:02:16.440
 light bugs and so on I wish 

00:02:15.120 --> 00:02:21.410
 you still have fun with this 

00:02:16.440 --> 00:02:21.410
 snapshot and have fun with it and ciao
