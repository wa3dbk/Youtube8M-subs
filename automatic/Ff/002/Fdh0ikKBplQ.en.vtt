sails<00:03:35.460> on<00:03:35.790> and<00:03:36.150> then<00:03:36.600> take<00:03:37.470> them<00:03:37.620> right<00:03:37.740> over

00:03:37.880 --> 00:03:37.890 
sails on and then take them right over

00:03:37.890 --> 00:03:40.400 
sails on and then take them right over
here<00:03:38.130> to<00:03:38.220> the<00:03:38.310> pond<00:03:38.550> and<00:03:38.850> the<00:03:39.060> sails<00:03:39.420> I<00:03:39.900> think

00:03:40.400 --> 00:03:40.410 
here to the pond and the sails I think

00:03:40.410 --> 00:03:43.040 
here to the pond and the sails I think
it's<00:03:40.530> in<00:03:40.680> our<00:03:40.770> DNA<00:03:40.910> we<00:03:41.910> want<00:03:42.150> to<00:03:42.270> build<00:03:42.570> stuff

00:03:43.040 --> 00:03:43.050 
it's in our DNA we want to build stuff

00:03:43.050 --> 00:03:45.890 
it's in our DNA we want to build stuff
that<00:03:43.800> seems<00:03:44.340> like<00:03:44.490> that<00:03:44.610> goes<00:03:44.790> away<00:03:44.970> some<00:03:45.330> yeah

00:03:45.890 --> 00:03:45.900 
that seems like that goes away some yeah

00:03:45.900 --> 00:03:47.420 
that seems like that goes away some yeah
we<00:03:46.200> always<00:03:46.350> wonder<00:03:46.710> about<00:03:46.740> that<00:03:47.010> something

00:03:47.420 --> 00:03:47.430 
we always wonder about that something

00:03:47.430 --> 00:03:50.000 
we always wonder about that something
happens<00:03:47.820> between<00:03:48.090> kids<00:03:48.690> of<00:03:48.840> this<00:03:48.900> age<00:03:49.110> when

00:03:50.000 --> 00:03:50.010 
happens between kids of this age when

00:03:50.010 --> 00:03:51.200 
happens between kids of this age when
they<00:03:50.100> come<00:03:50.280> and<00:03:50.430> you<00:03:50.490> can't<00:03:50.700> keep<00:03:50.820> my<00:03:50.970> way<00:03:51.060> from

00:03:51.200 --> 00:03:51.210 
they come and you can't keep my way from

00:03:51.210 --> 00:03:52.280 
they come and you can't keep my way from
the<00:03:51.270> table<00:03:51.600> you<00:03:51.630> can't<00:03:51.900> keep<00:03:51.990> her<00:03:52.140> away<00:03:52.260> from

00:03:52.280 --> 00:03:52.290 
the table you can't keep her away from

00:03:52.290 --> 00:03:53.960 
the table you can't keep her away from
tools<00:03:52.680> when<00:03:53.190> they<00:03:53.280> come<00:03:53.430> out<00:03:53.460> of<00:03:53.640> high<00:03:53.700> school

00:03:53.960 --> 00:03:53.970 
tools when they come out of high school

00:03:53.970 --> 00:03:56.540 
tools when they come out of high school

00:03:56.550 --> 00:03:57.920 
and I think there are no jobs out there
they<00:03:56.880> can't<00:03:57.090> work<00:03:57.240> with<00:03:57.420> their<00:03:57.510> hands<00:03:57.690> you<00:03:57.810> got
