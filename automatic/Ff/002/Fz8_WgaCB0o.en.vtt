00:00:45.139 --> 00:00:45.149 
on the screen right now the actual code

00:00:45.149 --> 00:00:47.420 
on the screen right now the actual code
that<00:00:45.390> this<00:00:45.539> guy<00:00:45.719> found<00:00:45.930> in<00:00:46.230> the<00:00:46.379> game<00:00:46.590> and<00:00:47.309> then

00:00:47.420 --> 00:00:47.430 
that this guy found in the game and then

00:00:47.430 --> 00:00:48.860 
that this guy found in the game and then
we're<00:00:47.520> gonna<00:00:47.640> talk<00:00:47.940> over<00:00:48.329> what<00:00:48.480> some<00:00:48.539> of<00:00:48.750> the

00:00:48.860 --> 00:00:48.870 
we're gonna talk over what some of the

00:00:48.870 --> 00:00:50.299 
we're gonna talk over what some of the
stuff<00:00:49.110> means<00:00:49.379> so<00:00:49.620> right<00:00:49.920> now<00:00:49.950> you<00:00:50.100> guys<00:00:50.250> are

00:00:50.299 --> 00:00:50.309 
stuff means so right now you guys are

00:00:50.309 --> 00:00:52.639 
stuff means so right now you guys are
seeing<00:00:50.700> on<00:00:50.910> the<00:00:51.030> screen<00:00:51.149> just<00:00:51.989> a<00:00:52.079> bunch<00:00:52.230> of<00:00:52.500> a

00:00:52.639 --> 00:00:52.649 
seeing on the screen just a bunch of a

00:00:52.649 --> 00:00:54.740 
seeing on the screen just a bunch of a
bunch<00:00:52.680> of<00:00:53.280> code<00:00:53.520> that<00:00:53.550> might<00:00:54.120> be<00:00:54.210> a<00:00:54.239> little<00:00:54.570> bit

00:00:54.740 --> 00:00:54.750 
bunch of code that might be a little bit

00:00:54.750 --> 00:00:55.910 
bunch of code that might be a little bit
difficult<00:00:54.930> to<00:00:55.170> read<00:00:55.410> but<00:00:55.440> if<00:00:55.680> you<00:00:55.770> guys

00:00:55.910 --> 00:00:55.920 
difficult to read but if you guys

00:00:55.920 --> 00:00:57.979 
difficult to read but if you guys
actually<00:00:56.420> carefully<00:00:57.420> go<00:00:57.510> through<00:00:57.780> it<00:00:57.840> you<00:00:57.960> can

00:00:57.979 --> 00:00:57.989 
actually carefully go through it you can

00:00:57.989 --> 00:01:00.410 
actually carefully go through it you can
figure<00:00:58.379> out<00:00:58.500> things<00:00:59.000> that<00:01:00.000> are<00:01:00.120> clearly

00:01:00.410 --> 00:01:00.420 
figure out things that are clearly

00:01:00.420 --> 00:01:02.479 
figure out things that are clearly
presented<00:01:00.780> in<00:01:01.230> that<00:01:01.379> code<00:01:01.559> so<00:01:01.770> basically<00:01:02.309> it

00:01:02.479 --> 00:01:02.489 
presented in that code so basically it

00:01:02.489 --> 00:01:04.250 
presented in that code so basically it
looks<00:01:02.609> like<00:01:02.820> we're<00:01:03.030> gonna<00:01:03.090> need<00:01:03.390> a<00:01:03.539> minimum<00:01:04.019> of

00:01:04.250 --> 00:01:04.260 
looks like we're gonna need a minimum of

00:01:04.260 --> 00:01:06.380 
looks like we're gonna need a minimum of
four<00:01:04.589> people<00:01:04.799> to<00:01:05.129> start<00:01:05.400> a<00:01:05.489> heist<00:01:05.700> which<00:01:06.240> is

00:01:06.380 --> 00:01:06.390 
four people to start a heist which is

00:01:06.390 --> 00:01:08.840 
four people to start a heist which is
cool<00:01:06.689> you<00:01:07.530> know<00:01:07.650> it's<00:01:07.890> it's<00:01:08.040> a<00:01:08.189> lot<00:01:08.340> more<00:01:08.490> fun<00:01:08.790> I

00:01:08.840 --> 00:01:08.850 
cool you know it's it's a lot more fun I

00:01:08.850 --> 00:01:10.100 
cool you know it's it's a lot more fun I
would<00:01:09.090> think<00:01:09.270> to<00:01:09.420> do<00:01:09.540> heist<00:01:09.780> with<00:01:09.990> your

00:01:10.100 --> 00:01:10.110 
would think to do heist with your

00:01:10.110 --> 00:01:11.780 
would think to do heist with your
friends<00:01:10.470> although<00:01:10.710> I<00:01:10.920> guess<00:01:11.369> it<00:01:11.640> would<00:01:11.760> be

00:01:11.780 --> 00:01:11.790 
friends although I guess it would be

00:01:11.790 --> 00:01:13.130 
friends although I guess it would be
pretty<00:01:12.119> cool<00:01:12.180> if<00:01:12.360> you<00:01:12.600> guys<00:01:12.659> could<00:01:12.930> actually

00:01:13.130 --> 00:01:13.140 
pretty cool if you guys could actually

00:01:13.140 --> 00:01:15.859 
pretty cool if you guys could actually
do<00:01:13.560> solo<00:01:14.100> hice<00:01:14.340> you<00:01:14.580> could<00:01:14.729> be<00:01:14.850> like<00:01:15.060> that<00:01:15.330> that

00:01:15.859 --> 00:01:15.869 
do solo hice you could be like that that

00:01:15.869 --> 00:01:19.700 
do solo hice you could be like that that
crazy<00:01:16.320> solo<00:01:17.009> hice<00:01:17.220> guy<00:01:17.869> from<00:01:18.869> from<00:01:19.259> the<00:01:19.380> movies

00:01:19.700 --> 00:01:19.710 
crazy solo hice guy from from the movies

00:01:19.710 --> 00:01:21.200 
crazy solo hice guy from from the movies
and<00:01:19.890> stuff<00:01:20.040> like<00:01:20.220> that<00:01:20.280> but<00:01:20.640> anyways<00:01:20.970> so<00:01:21.180> uh

00:01:21.200 --> 00:01:21.210 
and stuff like that but anyways so uh

00:01:21.210 --> 00:01:23.270 
and stuff like that but anyways so uh
that's<00:01:21.600> for<00:01:22.110> people<00:01:22.290> minimum<00:01:22.860> and<00:01:23.040> then<00:01:23.159> it

00:01:23.270 --> 00:01:23.280 
that's for people minimum and then it

00:01:23.280 --> 00:01:25.039 
that's for people minimum and then it
looks<00:01:23.460> like<00:01:23.640> the<00:01:23.790> reward<00:01:24.180> is<00:01:24.330> only<00:01:24.390> going<00:01:24.869> to

00:01:25.039 --> 00:01:25.049 
looks like the reward is only going to

00:01:25.049 --> 00:01:27.380 
looks like the reward is only going to
be<00:01:25.170> eighty<00:01:25.409> thousand<00:01:26.100> dollars<00:01:26.430> which<00:01:26.670> divided

00:01:27.380 --> 00:01:27.390 
be eighty thousand dollars which divided

00:01:27.390 --> 00:01:29.539 
be eighty thousand dollars which divided
between<00:01:27.810> four<00:01:28.140> people<00:01:28.470> really<00:01:28.829> just<00:01:28.860> doesn't

00:01:29.539 --> 00:01:29.549 
between four people really just doesn't

00:01:29.549 --> 00:01:31.550 
between four people really just doesn't
seem<00:01:29.790> like<00:01:29.820> that<00:01:30.030> much<00:01:30.270> to<00:01:30.840> me<00:01:30.960> I'm<00:01:31.170> hoping

00:01:31.550 --> 00:01:31.560 
seem like that much to me I'm hoping

00:01:31.560 --> 00:01:33.440 
seem like that much to me I'm hoping
that<00:01:31.770> that<00:01:32.040> is<00:01:32.159> maybe<00:01:32.400> like<00:01:32.520> a<00:01:32.670> minimum<00:01:33.270> and

00:01:33.440 --> 00:01:33.450 
that that is maybe like a minimum and

00:01:52.609 --> 00:01:52.619 
to grind but anyway so it also looks

00:01:52.619 --> 00:01:55.010 
to grind but anyway so it also looks
like<00:01:52.710> the<00:01:52.829> XP<00:01:53.520> reward<00:01:54.030> for<00:01:54.360> doing<00:01:54.540> the<00:01:54.810> heist

00:01:55.010 --> 00:01:55.020 
like the XP reward for doing the heist

00:01:55.020 --> 00:01:58.730 
like the XP reward for doing the heist
is<00:01:55.320> going<00:01:55.619> to<00:01:55.770> be<00:01:55.920> 11<00:01:56.880> that<00:01:57.240> or<00:01:57.509> 11<00:01:58.110> hundred<00:01:58.350> and

00:01:58.730 --> 00:01:58.740 
is going to be 11 that or 11 hundred and

00:01:58.740 --> 00:02:02.450 
is going to be 11 that or 11 hundred and
forty<00:01:59.070> per<00:01:59.280> person<00:01:59.670> so<00:02:00.140> 1140<00:02:01.140> again<00:02:01.799> not<00:02:02.100> not

00:02:02.450 --> 00:02:02.460 
forty per person so 1140 again not not

00:02:02.460 --> 00:02:04.429 
forty per person so 1140 again not not
an<00:02:02.610> amazing<00:02:03.030> amounts<00:02:03.299> of<00:02:03.390> RP<00:02:03.689> I'm<00:02:03.840> hoping<00:02:04.259> that

00:02:04.429 --> 00:02:04.439 
an amazing amounts of RP I'm hoping that

00:02:04.439 --> 00:02:06.980 
an amazing amounts of RP I'm hoping that
these<00:02:04.560> are<00:02:04.799> low<00:02:04.979> balls<00:02:05.250> variables<00:02:05.909> and<00:02:06.149> and

00:02:06.980 --> 00:02:06.990 
these are low balls variables and and

00:02:06.990 --> 00:02:08.479 
these are low balls variables and and
that<00:02:07.229> these<00:02:07.439> are<00:02:07.560> like<00:02:07.740> the<00:02:07.770> lowest<00:02:08.220> amount

00:02:08.479 --> 00:02:08.489 
that these are like the lowest amount

00:02:08.489 --> 00:02:10.130 
that these are like the lowest amount
you<00:02:08.640> can<00:02:08.759> get<00:02:08.940> if<00:02:09.090> you<00:02:09.179> do<00:02:09.330> really<00:02:09.629> bad<00:02:09.899> on<00:02:10.050> the

00:02:10.130 --> 00:02:10.140 
you can get if you do really bad on the

00:02:10.140 --> 00:02:11.960 
you can get if you do really bad on the
heist<00:02:10.229> and<00:02:10.560> then<00:02:10.920> hopefully<00:02:11.129> we<00:02:11.400> can<00:02:11.520> actually

00:02:11.960 --> 00:02:11.970
